there
is
scarcely
a
single
cause
in
which
a
woman
is
not
engaged
in
some
way
fomenting
the
then
you
offer
me
no
hope
doctor
the
gray
mane
of
doctor
samuel
ward
waved
like
a
fighting
crest
as
he
made
answer
not
the
sort
of
hope
you
ask
a
moment
later
he
added
john
i
am
ashamed
of
you
the
cynical
smile
of
the
man
i
called
my
chief
still
remained
upon
his
lips
the
same
drawn
look
of
suffering
still
remained
upon
his
gaunt
features
but
in
his
blue
eye
i
saw
a
glint
which
proved
that
the
answer
of
his
old
friend
had
struck
out
some
unused
spark
of
vitality
from
the
deep
cold
flint
of
his
heart
i
never
knew
you
for
a
coward
calhoun
went
on
doctor
ward
nor
any
of
your
family
i
give
you
now
the
benefit
of
my
personal
acquaintance
with
this
generation
of
the
calhouns
i
ask
something
more
of
you
than
the
keen
eyes
turned
upon
him
again
with
the
old
flame
of
flint
which
a
generation
had
known
a
generation
for
the
most
part
of
enemies
on
my
chief
face
i
saw
appear
again
the
fighting
flush
proof
of
his
nature
ever
ready
to
rejoin
with
challenge
when
challenge
came
did
not
saul
fall
upon
his
own
sword
asked
john
calhoun
have
not
devoted
leaders
from
the
start
of
the
world
till
now
sometimes
rid
the
scene
of
the
responsible
figures
in
lost
fights
the
men
on
whom
blame
rested
for
failures
cowards
rejoined
doctor
ward
cowards
every
one
of
them
were
there
not
other
swords
upon
which
they
might
have
fallen
those
of
their
enemies
it
is
not
my
own
hand
my
own
sword
sam
said
calhoun
not
that
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
i
am
already
marked
and
doomed
even
as
i
sit
at
my
table
a
walk
of
a
wet
night
here
in
washington
a
turn
along
the
heights
out
there
when
the
winter
wind
is
keen
yes
sam
i
see
my
grave
before
me
close
enough
but
how
can
i
rest
easy
in
that
grave
man
we
have
not
yet
dreamed
how
great
a
country
this
may
be
we
have
texas
we
have
also
oregon
we
must
have
free
the
old
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
at
the
arch
exponent
then
since
you
mention
it
yes
retorted
calhoun
fretfully
but
i
shall
not
go
into
the
old
argument
of
those
who
say
that
black
is
white
that
south
is
north
it
is
only
for
my
own
race
that
i
plan
a
wider
america
but
then
calhoun
raised
a
long
thin
hand
why
he
went
on
slowly
i
have
just
told
you
that
i
have
failed
and
yet
you
my
old
friend
whom
i
ought
to
trust
condemn
me
to
live
on
doctor
samuel
ward
took
snuff
again
but
all
the
answer
he
made
was
to
waggle
his
gray
mane
and
stare
hard
at
the
face
of
the
other
yes
said
he
at
length
i
condemn
you
to
fight
on
john
and
he
smiled
grimly
why
look
at
you
man
he
broke
out
fiercely
after
a
moment
the
type
and
picture
of
combat
good
bone
fine
bone
and
hard
a
hard
head
and
bony
little
eye
set
deep
strong
wiry
muscles
not
too
big
fighting
muscles
not
dough
clean
limbs
strong
fingers
good
arms
legs
neck
wide
chest
then
you
give
me
hope
calhoun
flashed
a
smile
at
him
no
sir
if
you
do
your
duty
there
is
no
hope
for
you
to
live
if
you
do
not
do
your
duty
there
is
no
hope
for
you
to
die
john
calhoun
for
more
than
two
years
to
come
perhaps
five
years
six
keep
up
this
work
as
you
must
my
friend
and
you
die
as
surely
as
though
i
shot
you
through
as
you
sit
there
now
is
this
any
comfort
to
you
a
gray
pallor
overspread
my
master
face
that
truth
is
welcome
to
no
man
morbid
or
sane
sound
or
ill
but
brave
men
meet
it
as
this
one
did
time
to
do
much
he
murmured
to
himself
time
to
mend
many
broken
vessels
in
those
two
years
one
more
fight
yes
let
us
have
it
but
calhoun
the
man
was
lost
once
more
in
calhoun
the
visionary
the
fanatic
statesman
he
summed
up
as
though
to
himself
something
of
the
situation
which
then
existed
at
washington
yes
the
coast
is
clearer
now
that
webster
is
out
of
the
cabinet
but
upshur
death
last
month
brings
in
new
complications
had
he
remained
our
secretary
of
state
much
might
have
been
done
it
was
only
last
october
he
proposed
to
texas
a
treaty
of
annexation
yes
and
found
texas
none
so
eager
frowned
doctor
ward
no
and
why
not
you
and
i
know
well
enough
sir
richard
pakenham
the
english
plenipotentiary
here
could
tell
if
he
liked
is
busy
with
texas
texas
owes
large
funds
to
wants
texas
as
a
colony
there
is
fire
under
this
smoky
talk
of
texas
dividing
into
two
governments
one
at
least
under
england
gentle
and
unselfish
care
and
now
look
you
calhoun
continued
rising
and
pacing
up
and
down
look
what
is
the
evidence
van
zandt
in
washington
for
the
republic
of
texas
wrote
secretary
upshur
only
a
month
before
upshur
death
and
told
him
to
go
carefully
or
he
would
drive
mexico
to
resume
the
war
so
cost
texas
the
friendship
of
england
excellent
van
zandt
i
at
least
know
what
the
friendship
of
england
means
so
he
asks
us
if
we
will
protect
texas
with
troops
and
ships
in
case
she
sign
that
agreement
of
annexation
cunning
van
zandt
he
knows
what
that
answer
must
be
with
england
ready
to
fight
us
for
texas
and
oregon
both
and
we
wholly
unready
for
war
cunning
van
zandt
covert
friend
of
england
and
lucky
upshur
who
was
killed
and
so
never
had
to
make
that
answer
but
john
another
will
have
to
make
it
the
one
way
or
the
other
said
his
friend
yes
the
long
hand
smote
on
the
table
president
tyler
has
offered
you
upshur
portfolio
as
secretary
of
state
yes
the
long
hand
smote
again
doctor
ward
made
no
comment
beyond
a
long
whistle
as
he
recrossed
his
legs
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
calhoun
frowning
face
there
will
be
events
said
he
at
length
grinning
i
have
not
yet
accepted
said
calhoun
if
i
do
it
will
be
to
bring
texas
and
oregon
into
this
union
one
slave
the
other
free
but
both
vast
and
of
a
mighty
future
for
us
that
done
i
resign
at
once
will
you
accept
calhoun
answer
was
first
to
pick
up
a
paper
from
his
desk
see
here
is
the
despatch
pakenham
brought
from
lord
aberdeen
of
the
british
ministry
to
upshur
just
two
days
before
his
death
judge
whether
aberdeen
wants
liberty
or
territory
in
effect
he
reasserts
right
to
interfere
in
our
affairs
we
fought
one
war
to
disprove
that
england
has
said
enough
on
this
continent
and
england
has
meddled
enough
calhoun
and
ward
looked
at
each
other
sober
in
their
realization
of
the
grave
problems
which
then
beset
american
statesmanship
and
american
thought
the
old
doctor
was
first
to
break
the
silence
then
do
you
accept
will
you
serve
again
john
listen
to
me
if
i
do
accept
i
shall
take
upshur
and
nelson
place
only
on
one
condition
yes
if
i
do
here
is
what
shall
say
to
england
regarding
texas
i
shall
show
her
what
a
monroe
doctrine
is
shall
show
her
that
while
texas
is
small
and
weak
texas
this
republic
are
not
this
is
what
i
have
drafted
as
a
possible
reply
i
shall
tell
pakenham
that
his
chief
avowal
of
intentions
has
made
it
our
in
to
hasten
the
annexation
of
texas
cost
what
it
may
mean
what
it
may
john
calhoun
does
not
will
be
my
answer
repeated
my
chief
at
last
again
they
looked
gravely
each
into
the
other
eye
each
knowing
what
all
this
might
mean
yes
i
shall
have
texas
as
i
shall
have
oregon
settled
before
i
lay
down
my
arms
sam
ward
no
i
am
yet
ready
to
die
calhoun
old
fire
now
flamed
in
all
his
mien
the
situation
is
extremely
difficult
said
his
friend
slowly
it
must
be
done
but
how
we
are
as
a
nation
not
ready
for
war
you
as
a
statesman
are
not
adequate
to
the
politics
of
all
this
where
is
your
political
party
john
you
have
none
you
have
outrun
all
parties
it
will
be
your
ruin
that
you
have
been
honest
calhoun
turned
on
him
swiftly
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
mere
politics
will
not
serve
it
will
take
some
extraordinary
measure
you
know
men
and
perhaps
yes
said
doctor
ward
and
a
precious
silly
lot
they
are
the
two
running
after
each
other
and
forgetting
each
other
using
and
wasting
each
other
ruining
and
despoiling
each
other
all
the
years
from
troy
to
rome
but
yes
for
a
man
set
a
woman
for
a
trap
i
suppose
calhoun
nodded
with
a
thin
smile
as
it
chances
i
need
a
man
ergo
and
very
plainly
i
must
use
a
woman
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
that
calhoun
planned
some
stratagem
was
plain
but
his
speech
for
the
time
remained
enigmatic
even
to
his
most
intimate
companion
there
are
two
women
in
our
world
said
calhoun
as
to
jackson
the
old
fool
was
a
monogamist
and
still
is
not
so
much
so
jim
polk
of
tennessee
never
does
he
appear
in
public
with
eyes
other
than
for
the
doña
lucrezia
of
the
mexican
legation
now
one
against
the
other
mexico
against
austria
doctor
ward
raised
his
eyebrows
in
perplexity
that
is
to
say
england
and
austria
went
on
calhoun
coldly
the
ambassadress
of
england
to
america
was
born
in
budapest
so
i
say
austria
or
perhaps
hungary
or
some
other
country
which
raised
this
strange
representative
who
has
made
some
stir
in
washington
here
these
last
few
weeks
ah
mean
the
baroness
exclaimed
doctor
ward
tut
tut
calhoun
nodded
with
the
same
cold
thin
smile
yes
he
said
i
mean
pakenham
reputed
mistress
his
assured
secret
agent
and
spy
the
beautiful
baroness
von
ritz
he
mentioned
a
name
then
well
known
in
diplomatic
and
social
life
when
intrigue
in
washington
if
not
open
was
none
too
well
hidden
gay
sir
richard
he
resumed
you
know
his
ancestor
was
a
of
the
duke
of
wellington
he
himself
seems
to
have
absorbed
some
of
the
great
duke
fondness
for
the
fair
before
he
came
to
us
he
was
with
england
legation
in
mexico
was
there
he
first
met
the
doña
lucrezia
is
said
he
would
have
remained
in
mexico
had
it
not
been
arranged
that
she
and
her
husband
señor
yturrio
should
accompany
general
almonte
in
the
mexican
ministry
here
on
conditions
sir
richard
agreed
to
accept
promotion
as
minister
plenipotentiary
to
washington
that
was
nine
years
ago
commented
doctor
ward
yes
and
it
was
only
last
fall
that
he
was
made
envoy
extraordinary
he
is
at
least
an
extraordinary
envoy
near
fifty
years
of
age
he
seems
to
forget
public
decency
he
forgets
even
the
doña
lucrezia
leaving
her
to
the
admiration
of
polk
and
van
zandt
and
follows
off
after
the
sprightly
baroness
von
ritz
meantime
señor
yturrio
forgets
the
doña
lucrezia
and
proceeds
to
follow
after
the
baroness
although
with
less
hope
than
sir
richard
as
they
say
at
least
pakenham
has
taste
the
baroness
von
ritz
has
brains
and
beauty
both
it
is
who
is
england
real
envoy
now
i
believe
she
knows
england
real
intentions
as
to
texas
doctor
ward
screwed
his
lips
for
a
long
whistle
as
he
contemplated
john
calhoun
thin
determined
face
i
do
not
care
at
present
to
say
more
went
on
my
chief
but
do
you
not
see
granted
certain
motives
polk
might
come
into
power
pledged
to
the
extension
of
our
southwest
borders
calhoun
are
you
mad
cried
his
friend
would
you
plunge
this
country
into
war
would
you
pit
two
peoples
like
cocks
on
a
floor
and
would
you
use
women
in
our
diplomacy
calhoun
now
was
no
longer
the
friend
the
humanitarian
he
was
the
relentless
machine
the
idea
the
single
purpose
which
to
the
world
at
large
he
had
been
all
his
life
in
congress
in
cabinets
on
this
or
the
other
side
of
the
throne
of
american
power
he
spoke
coldly
as
he
went
on
in
these
matters
it
is
not
a
question
of
means
but
of
results
if
war
comes
let
it
come
although
i
hope
it
will
not
come
as
to
the
use
of
women
tell
me
not
women
why
anything
but
women
it
is
only
playing
life
against
life
one
variant
against
another
that
is
politics
my
friend
i
pakenham
so
i
must
learn
what
wants
does
he
want
texas
for
england
or
the
baroness
von
ritz
himself
ward
still
sat
and
looked
at
him
my
god
said
he
at
last
softly
but
calhoun
went
on
why
who
has
made
the
maps
of
the
world
and
who
has
written
pages
in
its
history
who
makes
and
unmakes
cities
and
empires
and
republics
and
not
man
are
you
so
ignorant
and
you
a
physician
who
know
them
both
gad
man
you
do
not
understand
your
own
profession
and
yet
you
seek
to
counsel
me
in
mine
strange
words
from
you
john
commented
his
friend
shaking
his
head
not
seemly
for
a
man
who
stands
where
you
stand
strange
weapons
yes
if
i
could
always
use
my
old
weapons
of
tongue
and
brain
i
would
not
need
these
perhaps
now
you
tell
me
my
time
is
short
i
must
fight
now
to
win
i
have
never
fought
to
lose
i
can
not
be
too
nice
in
agents
and
instruments
the
old
doctor
rose
and
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
little
room
one
of
calhoun
modest
ménage
at
the
nation
capital
which
then
was
not
the
city
it
is
calhoun
followed
him
with
even
steps
changes
of
maps
my
friend
listen
to
me
the
geography
of
america
for
the
next
fifty
years
rests
under
a
little
roof
over
in
m
street
a
roof
which
sir
richard
secretly
maintains
the
map
of
the
united
states
i
tell
you
is
covered
with
a
down
counterpane
you
ask
me
to
go
on
with
my
fight
i
answer
first
i
must
find
the
woman
now
i
say
i
have
found
her
as
you
know
also
i
have
told
you
i
have
found
her
under
a
counterpane
texas
oregon
these
united
states
under
a
counterpane
doctor
ward
sighed
as
he
shook
his
head
i
do
pretend
to
know
now
all
you
mean
calhoun
whirled
on
him
fiercely
with
a
vigor
which
his
wasted
frame
did
not
indicate
as
possible
listen
then
and
i
will
tell
you
what
john
calhoun
means
john
calhoun
who
has
loved
his
own
state
who
has
hated
those
who
hated
him
who
has
never
prayed
for
those
who
despitefully
used
him
who
has
fought
and
will
fight
since
all
insist
on
that
it
is
true
tyler
has
offered
me
again
the
portfolio
of
secretary
of
state
shall
i
take
it
if
i
do
it
means
that
i
am
employed
by
this
administration
to
secure
the
admission
of
texas
can
you
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
my
ambition
is
for
it
all
every
foot
of
new
land
west
to
the
pacific
that
we
can
get
slave
free
can
you
believe
john
calhoun
advocate
and
orator
all
his
life
when
he
says
that
he
believes
he
is
an
humble
instrument
destined
with
god
aid
and
through
the
use
of
such
instruments
as
our
human
society
affords
to
build
a
wider
slave
country
but
a
wider
america
it
would
be
worth
the
fight
of
a
few
years
more
calhoun
gravely
answered
his
old
friend
i
admit
i
had
not
dreamed
this
of
you
history
will
not
write
it
of
me
perhaps
went
on
my
chief
but
you
tell
me
to
fight
and
now
i
shall
fight
and
in
my
own
way
i
tell
you
that
answer
shall
go
to
pakenham
and
i
tell
you
pakenham
shall
not
take
offense
at
me
war
with
mexico
we
possibly
indeed
certainly
shall
have
war
on
the
northwest
too
we
yet
may
have
unless
he
paused
and
doctor
ward
prompted
him
some
moments
later
as
he
still
remained
in
thought
unless
what
john
what
do
you
mean
still
hearing
the
rustle
of
skirts
yes
unless
the
celebrated
baroness
helena
von
ritz
says
otherwise
replied
he
grimly
how
dignified
a
diplomacy
have
we
here
you
plan
war
between
two
embassies
on
the
distaff
side
smiled
doctor
ward
calhoun
continued
his
walk
i
do
not
say
so
he
made
answer
but
if
there
must
be
war
we
may
reflect
that
war
is
at
its
best
when
woman
in
the
field
chapter
ii
by
special
despatch
in
all
eras
and
all
climes
a
woman
of
great
genius
or
beauty
has
done
what
she
nicholas
said
calhoun
turning
to
me
suddenly
but
with
his
invariable
kindliness
of
tone
oblige
me
i
have
written
a
message
here
you
will
see
the
address
i
have
unavoidably
heard
this
lady
name
i
hesitated
you
will
find
the
lady
name
above
the
seal
take
her
this
message
from
me
yes
your
errand
is
to
bring
the
least
known
and
most
talked
of
woman
in
washington
alone
unattended
save
by
yourself
to
a
gentleman
apartments
to
his
house
at
a
time
past
the
hour
of
midnight
that
gentleman
is
myself
you
must
not
take
any
answer
in
the
negative
as
i
sat
dumbly
holding
this
sealed
document
in
my
hand
he
turned
to
doctor
ward
with
a
nod
toward
myself
i
choose
my
young
aide
trist
here
for
good
reasons
he
is
just
back
from
six
months
in
the
wilderness
and
may
be
shy
but
once
he
had
a
way
with
women
so
they
tell
me
and
you
know
in
approaching
the
question
we
operate
doctor
ward
took
snuff
with
violence
as
he
regarded
me
critically
i
do
not
doubt
the
young
man
sincerity
and
faithfulness
said
he
i
was
only
questioning
one
thing
yes
his
age
calhoun
rubbed
his
chin
nicholas
said
he
you
heard
me
i
have
no
wish
to
encumber
you
with
useless
instructions
your
errand
is
before
you
very
much
depends
upon
it
as
you
have
heard
all
i
can
say
is
keep
your
head
keep
your
feet
and
keep
your
heart
the
two
older
men
both
turned
now
and
smiled
at
me
in
a
manner
not
wholly
to
my
liking
neither
was
this
errand
to
my
liking
it
was
true
i
was
hardly
arrived
home
after
many
months
in
the
west
but
i
had
certain
plans
of
my
own
for
that
very
night
and
although
as
yet
i
had
made
no
definite
engagement
with
my
fiancée
miss
elisabeth
churchill
of
elmhurst
farm
for
meeting
her
at
the
great
ball
this
night
such
certainly
was
my
desire
and
my
intention
why
i
had
scarce
seen
elisabeth
twice
in
the
last
year
how
now
nick
my
son
began
my
chief
have
staff
and
scrip
been
your
portion
so
long
that
you
are
wholly
wedded
to
them
come
i
think
the
night
might
promise
you
something
of
interest
i
assure
you
of
one
thing
you
will
receive
no
willing
answer
from
the
fair
baroness
she
will
scoff
at
you
and
perhaps
bid
you
farewell
see
to
it
then
do
what
you
like
but
bring
her
you
and
bring
her
you
will
realize
the
importance
of
all
this
when
i
tell
you
that
my
answer
to
tyler
must
be
in
before
noon
that
answer
will
depend
upon
the
answer
the
baroness
von
ritz
makes
to
here
i
can
not
go
to
her
so
she
must
come
to
me
you
have
often
served
me
well
my
son
serve
me
my
time
is
short
i
have
no
moves
to
lose
it
is
you
who
will
decide
before
morning
whether
or
not
john
calhoun
is
the
next
secretary
of
state
and
that
will
decide
whether
or
not
texas
is
to
be
a
state
i
had
never
seen
calhoun
so
intent
so
absorbed
we
all
three
now
sat
silent
in
the
little
room
where
the
candles
guttered
in
the
great
glass
on
the
mantel
an
apartment
scarce
better
lighted
by
the
further
aid
of
lamps
fed
by
oil
he
might
be
older
said
calhoun
at
length
speaking
of
me
as
though
i
were
not
present
and
is
a
hard
game
to
play
if
once
my
lady
helena
takes
it
into
her
merry
head
to
make
it
so
for
him
but
if
i
sent
one
shorter
of
stature
and
uglier
of
visage
and
with
less
art
in
approaching
a
crinoline
why
perhaps
he
would
get
no
farther
than
her
door
no
he
will
serve
he
serve
he
arose
now
and
bowed
to
us
both
even
as
i
rose
and
turned
for
my
cloak
to
shield
me
from
the
raw
drizzle
which
then
was
falling
in
the
streets
doctor
ward
reached
down
his
own
shaggy
top
hat
from
the
rack
to
bed
with
you
now
john
said
he
sternly
no
i
must
write
you
heard
me
say
to
bed
with
you
a
stiff
toddy
to
make
you
sleep
nicholas
here
may
wake
you
soon
enough
with
his
mysterious
companion
i
think
will
be
time
enough
for
you
to
work
and
very
likely
will
bring
work
for
you
to
do
calhoun
sighed
god
he
exclaimed
if
i
but
had
back
my
strength
if
there
were
more
than
those
scant
remaining
years
go
said
he
suddenly
and
so
we
others
passed
down
his
step
and
out
into
the
streets
so
this
then
was
my
errand
my
mind
still
tingled
at
its
unwelcome
quality
doctor
ward
guessed
something
of
my
mental
dissatisfaction
never
mind
nicholas
said
he
as
we
parted
at
the
street
corner
where
he
climbed
into
the
rickety
carriage
which
his
colored
driver
held
awaiting
him
never
mind
i
do
myself
quite
know
what
calhoun
wants
but
he
would
not
ask
of
you
anything
personally
improper
do
his
errand
then
it
is
part
of
your
work
in
any
case
and
i
thought
i
saw
him
grin
in
the
dim
light
you
may
have
a
night
which
you
will
remember
there
proved
to
be
truth
in
what
he
said
chapter
iii
in
argument
the
egotism
of
women
is
always
for
de
the
thought
of
missing
my
meeting
with
elisabeth
still
rankled
in
my
soul
had
it
been
another
man
who
asked
me
to
carry
this
message
i
must
have
refused
but
this
man
was
my
master
my
chief
in
whose
service
i
had
engaged
strange
enough
it
may
seem
to
give
john
calhoun
any
title
showing
love
or
respect
most
men
call
him
traitor
call
him
the
man
responsible
for
the
war
between
north
and
south
call
him
the
arch
apostle
of
that
impossible
doctrine
of
slavery
which
we
all
now
admit
was
wrong
why
then
should
i
love
him
as
i
did
i
can
not
say
except
that
i
always
loved
honored
and
admired
courage
uprightness
integrity
for
myself
his
agent
i
had
as
i
say
left
the
old
trist
homestead
at
the
foot
of
south
mountain
in
maryland
to
seek
my
fortune
in
our
capital
city
i
had
had
some
three
or
four
years
training
when
i
first
met
calhoun
and
entered
his
service
as
assistant
it
was
under
him
that
i
finished
my
studies
in
law
meantime
i
was
his
messenger
in
very
many
quests
his
source
of
information
in
many
matters
where
he
had
no
time
to
go
into
details
strange
enough
had
been
some
of
the
circumstances
in
which
i
found
myself
thrust
through
this
relation
with
a
man
so
intimately
connected
for
a
generation
with
our
public
life
adventures
were
always
to
my
liking
and
surely
i
had
my
share
i
knew
the
frontier
marches
of
tennessee
and
alabama
the
intricacies
of
politics
of
ohio
and
new
york
mixed
as
those
things
were
in
tyler
time
i
had
even
been
as
far
west
as
the
rockies
of
which
young
frémont
was
now
beginning
to
write
so
understandingly
for
six
months
i
had
been
in
mississippi
and
texas
studying
matters
and
men
and
now
just
back
from
natchitoches
i
felt
that
i
had
earned
some
little
rest
but
there
was
the
fascination
of
it
that
big
game
of
politics
no
i
will
call
it
by
its
better
name
of
statesmanship
which
sometimes
it
deserved
in
those
days
as
it
does
not
that
was
a
day
of
warwicks
the
nominal
rulers
did
not
hold
the
greatest
titles
naturally
i
knew
something
of
these
things
from
the
nature
of
my
work
in
calhoun
office
i
have
had
insight
into
documents
which
never
became
public
i
have
seen
treaties
made
i
have
seen
the
making
of
maps
go
forward
this
indeed
i
was
in
part
to
see
that
very
night
and
curiously
too
how
the
baroness
von
ritz
beautiful
adventuress
as
she
was
sometimes
credited
with
being
charming
woman
as
she
was
elsewhere
described
fascinating
and
in
some
part
dangerous
to
any
man
as
all
admitted
could
care
to
be
concerned
with
this
purely
political
question
of
our
possible
territories
i
was
not
shrewd
enough
at
that
moment
in
advance
to
guess
for
i
had
nothing
more
certain
than
the
rumor
she
was
england
spy
i
bided
my
time
knowing
that
ere
long
the
knowledge
must
come
to
me
in
calhoun
office
even
in
case
i
did
not
first
learn
more
than
calhoun
himself
vaguely
in
my
conscience
i
felt
that
after
all
my
errand
was
justified
even
though
at
some
cost
to
my
own
wishes
and
my
own
pride
the
farther
i
walked
in
the
dark
along
pennsylvania
avenue
into
which
finally
i
swung
after
i
had
crossed
rock
bridge
the
more
i
realized
that
perhaps
this
big
game
was
worth
playing
in
detail
and
without
quibble
as
the
master
mind
should
dictate
as
he
was
servant
of
a
purpose
of
an
ideal
of
triumphant
democracy
why
should
not
i
also
serve
in
a
cause
so
splendid
i
was
indeed
young
nicholas
trist
of
maryland
six
feet
tall
thin
lean
always
hungry
perhaps
a
trifle
freckled
a
little
sandy
of
hair
blue
i
suppose
of
eye
although
i
am
not
sure
good
rider
and
good
marcher
i
know
something
of
an
expert
with
the
weapons
of
my
time
and
people
fond
of
a
horse
and
a
dog
and
a
rifle
yes
and
a
glass
and
a
girl
if
truth
be
told
i
was
not
yet
thirty
in
spite
of
my
western
travels
at
that
age
the
rustle
of
silk
or
dimity
the
suspicion
of
adventure
tempts
the
worst
or
the
best
of
us
i
fear
woman
the
very
sound
of
the
word
made
my
blood
leap
then
i
went
forward
rather
blithely
as
i
now
blush
to
confess
if
there
are
maps
to
be
made
said
i
the
baroness
helena
shall
do
her
share
in
writing
on
my
chief
old
mahogany
desk
and
not
on
her
own
dressing
case
that
was
an
idle
boast
though
made
but
to
myself
i
had
not
yet
met
the
woman
chapter
iv
the
baroness
helena
woman
is
seldom
merciful
to
the
man
who
is
timid
bulwer
there
was
one
of
our
dim
street
lights
at
a
central
corner
on
old
pennsylvania
avenue
and
under
it
after
a
long
walk
i
paused
for
a
glance
at
the
inscription
on
my
sealed
document
i
had
not
looked
at
it
before
in
the
confusion
of
my
somewhat
hurried
mental
processes
in
addition
to
the
name
and
street
number
in
calhoun
writing
i
read
this
memorandum
knock
at
the
third
door
in
the
second
block
beyond
m
street
i
recalled
the
nearest
cross
street
but
i
must
confess
the
direction
still
seemed
somewhat
cryptic
puzzled
i
stood
under
the
lamp
shielding
the
face
of
the
note
under
my
cloak
to
keep
off
the
rain
as
i
studied
it
the
sound
of
wheels
behind
me
on
the
muddy
pavement
called
my
attention
and
i
looked
about
a
carriage
came
swinging
up
to
the
curb
where
i
stood
it
was
driven
rapidly
and
as
it
approached
the
door
swung
open
i
heard
a
quick
word
and
the
driver
pulled
up
his
horses
i
saw
the
light
shine
through
the
door
on
a
glimpse
of
white
satin
i
looked
again
yes
it
was
a
beckoning
hand
the
negro
driver
looked
at
me
inquiringly
ah
well
i
suppose
diplomacy
under
the
stars
runs
much
the
same
in
all
ages
i
have
said
that
i
loved
elisabeth
but
also
said
i
was
not
yet
thirty
moreover
i
was
a
gentleman
and
here
might
be
a
lady
in
need
of
help
i
need
not
say
that
in
a
moment
i
was
at
the
side
of
the
carriage
its
occupant
made
no
exclamation
of
surprise
in
fact
she
moved
back
upon
the
other
side
of
the
seat
in
the
darkness
as
though
to
make
room
for
me
i
was
absorbed
in
a
personal
puzzle
here
was
i
messenger
upon
some
important
errand
as
i
might
guess
but
white
satin
and
a
midnight
adventure
at
least
a
gentleman
might
bow
and
ask
if
he
could
be
of
assistance
a
dark
framed
face
whose
outlines
i
could
only
dimly
see
in
the
faint
light
of
the
street
lamp
leaned
toward
me
the
same
small
hand
nervously
reached
out
as
though
in
request
i
now
very
naturally
stepped
closer
a
pair
of
wide
and
very
dark
eyes
was
looking
into
mine
i
could
now
see
her
face
there
was
no
smile
upon
her
lips
i
had
never
seen
her
before
that
was
sure
nor
did
i
ever
think
to
see
her
like
again
i
could
say
that
even
then
even
in
the
half
light
just
a
trifle
foreign
the
face
somewhat
dark
but
not
too
dark
the
lips
full
the
eyes
luminous
the
forehead
beautifully
arched
chin
and
cheek
beautifully
rounded
nose
and
straight
thin
but
not
pinched
there
was
nothing
niggard
about
her
she
was
magnificent
a
magnificent
woman
i
saw
that
she
had
splendid
jewels
at
her
throat
in
her
ears
a
necklace
of
diamonds
long
hoops
of
diamonds
and
emeralds
used
as
a
sparkling
clasp
which
caught
at
her
white
throat
the
wrap
which
she
had
thrown
about
her
ball
gown
for
now
i
saw
she
was
in
full
evening
dress
i
guessed
she
had
been
an
attendant
at
the
great
ball
that
ball
which
i
had
missed
with
so
keen
a
regret
myself
the
ball
where
i
had
hoped
to
dance
with
elisabeth
without
doubt
she
had
lost
her
way
and
was
asking
the
first
stranger
for
instructions
to
her
driver
my
lady
whoever
she
was
seemed
pleased
with
her
rapid
temporary
scrutiny
with
a
faint
murmur
whether
of
invitation
or
not
i
scarce
could
tell
she
drew
back
again
to
the
farther
side
of
the
seat
before
i
knew
how
or
why
i
was
at
her
side
the
driver
pushed
shut
the
door
and
whipped
up
his
team
personally
i
am
gifted
with
but
small
imagination
in
a
very
matter
of
fact
way
i
had
got
into
this
carriage
with
a
strange
lady
now
in
a
sober
and
matter
of
fact
way
it
appeared
to
me
my
duty
to
find
out
the
reason
for
this
singular
situation
madam
i
remarked
to
my
companion
in
what
manner
can
i
be
of
service
to
you
this
evening
i
made
no
attempt
to
explain
who
i
was
or
to
ask
who
or
what
she
herself
was
for
i
had
no
doubt
that
our
interview
soon
would
be
terminated
i
am
fortunate
that
you
are
a
gentleman
she
said
in
a
low
and
soft
voice
quite
distinct
quite
musical
in
quality
and
marked
with
just
the
faintest
trace
of
some
foreign
accent
although
her
english
was
perfect
i
looked
again
at
her
yes
her
hair
was
dark
that
was
sure
it
swept
up
in
a
great
roll
above
her
oval
brow
her
eyes
too
must
be
dark
i
confirmed
yes
as
a
passed
lamp
gave
me
aid
there
were
strong
dark
brows
above
them
her
nose
too
was
patrician
her
chin
curving
just
strongly
enough
but
not
too
full
and
faintly
cleft
a
sign
of
power
they
say
a
third
gracious
lamp
gave
me
a
glimpse
of
her
figure
huddled
back
among
her
draperies
and
i
guessed
her
to
be
about
of
medium
height
a
fourth
lamp
showed
me
her
hands
small
firm
white
also
i
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
arm
as
it
lay
outstretched
her
fingers
clasping
a
fan
so
i
knew
her
arms
were
round
and
taper
hence
all
her
limbs
and
figure
finely
molded
because
nature
does
not
do
such
things
by
halves
and
makes
no
bungles
in
her
symmetry
of
contour
when
she
plans
a
noble
specimen
of
humanity
here
a
noble
specimen
of
what
woman
may
be
on
the
whole
as
i
must
confess
i
sighed
rather
comfortably
at
the
fifth
street
lamp
for
if
my
chief
must
intrust
to
me
adventures
of
a
dark
night
adventures
leading
to
closed
carriages
and
strange
companions
i
had
far
liefer
it
should
be
some
such
woman
as
this
i
was
not
in
such
a
hurry
to
ask
again
how
i
might
be
of
service
in
fact
being
somewhat
surprised
and
somewhat
pleased
i
remained
silent
now
for
a
time
and
let
matters
adjust
themselves
which
is
not
a
bad
course
for
any
one
similarly
engaged
she
turned
toward
me
at
last
deliberately
her
fan
against
her
lips
studying
me
and
i
did
as
much
taking
such
advantage
as
i
could
of
the
passing
street
lamps
then
all
at
once
without
warning
or
apology
she
smiled
showing
very
even
and
white
teeth
she
smiled
there
came
to
me
from
the
shadows
some
sort
of
deep
perfume
strange
to
me
i
frown
at
the
description
of
such
things
and
such
emotions
but
i
swear
that
as
i
sat
there
a
stranger
not
four
minutes
in
companionship
with
this
other
stranger
i
felt
swim
up
around
me
some
sort
of
amber
shadow
edged
with
purple
the
shadow
as
i
figured
it
then
being
this
perfume
curious
and
alluring
it
was
wet
there
in
the
street
why
should
i
rebel
at
this
stealing
charm
of
color
or
fragrance
let
those
name
it
better
who
can
at
least
i
sat
smiling
to
myself
in
my
shadow
now
in
no
very
special
hurry
and
now
again
she
smiled
thoughtfully
rather
approving
my
own
silence
as
i
guessed
perhaps
because
it
showed
no
unmanly
perturbation
my
lack
of
imagination
passing
for
aplomb
at
last
i
could
not
in
politeness
keep
this
up
further
may
i
serve
the
baroness
said
i
she
started
back
on
the
seat
as
far
as
she
could
go
how
did
you
know
she
asked
and
who
are
i
laughed
i
did
not
know
and
did
not
guess
until
almost
as
i
began
to
speak
but
if
it
comes
to
that
i
might
say
i
am
simply
an
humble
gentleman
of
washington
here
i
might
be
privileged
to
peep
in
at
ambassadors
balls
through
the
windows
at
least
but
you
were
not
there
you
did
not
see
me
i
never
saw
you
in
my
life
until
this
very
moment
how
then
do
you
know
me
speak
at
once
her
satins
rustled
i
knew
she
was
tapping
a
foot
on
the
carriage
floor
madam
i
answered
laughing
at
her
by
this
amber
purple
shadow
with
flecks
of
scarlet
and
pink
by
this
perfume
which
weaves
webs
for
me
here
in
this
carriage
i
know
you
the
light
is
poor
but
it
is
good
enough
to
show
one
who
can
be
no
one
else
but
the
baroness
von
ritz
i
was
in
the
mood
to
spice
an
adventure
which
had
gone
thus
far
of
course
she
thought
me
crazed
and
drew
back
again
in
the
shadow
but
when
i
turned
and
smiled
she
smiled
in
answer
herself
somewhat
puzzled
the
baroness
von
ritz
can
not
be
disguised
i
said
not
even
if
she
wore
her
domino
she
looked
down
at
the
little
mask
which
hung
from
the
silken
cord
and
flung
it
from
her
oh
then
very
well
she
said
if
you
know
who
i
am
who
are
and
why
do
you
talk
in
this
absurd
way
with
me
a
stranger
and
why
madam
do
you
take
me
up
a
stranger
in
this
absurd
way
at
midnight
on
the
streets
of
washington
i
who
am
engaged
on
business
for
my
chief
she
tapped
again
with
her
foot
on
the
carriage
floor
tell
me
who
you
are
she
said
once
a
young
planter
from
maryland
yonder
sometime
lawyer
here
in
washington
it
is
my
misfortune
not
to
be
so
distinguished
in
fame
or
beauty
that
my
name
is
known
by
all
so
i
need
not
tell
you
my
name
perhaps
only
assuring
you
that
i
am
at
your
service
if
i
may
be
useful
your
name
she
again
demanded
i
told
her
the
first
one
that
came
to
my
lips
i
do
not
remember
what
it
did
not
deceive
her
for
a
moment
of
course
that
is
not
your
name
she
said
because
it
does
not
fit
you
you
have
me
still
at
disadvantage
and
me
madam
you
are
taking
me
miles
out
of
my
way
how
can
i
help
you
do
you
perhaps
wish
to
hunt
mushrooms
in
the
georgetown
woods
when
morning
comes
i
wish
that
i
might
join
you
but
i
fear
you
mock
me
she
retorted
very
good
let
me
tell
you
it
was
not
your
personal
charm
which
attracted
me
when
i
saw
you
on
the
pavement
because
you
were
the
only
man
in
sight
i
bowed
my
thanks
for
a
moment
nothing
was
heard
save
the
steady
patter
of
hoofs
on
the
ragged
pavement
at
length
she
went
on
i
am
alone
i
have
been
followed
i
was
followed
when
i
called
to
you
by
another
carriage
i
asked
help
of
the
first
gentleman
i
saw
having
heard
that
americans
all
are
gentlemen
true
said
i
i
do
not
blame
you
neither
do
i
blame
the
occupant
of
the
other
carriage
for
following
you
i
pray
you
leave
aside
such
chatter
she
exclaimed
very
well
then
madam
perhaps
the
best
way
is
for
us
to
be
more
straightforward
if
i
can
not
be
of
service
i
beg
you
to
let
me
descend
for
i
have
business
which
i
must
execute
this
of
course
was
but
tentative
i
did
not
care
to
tell
her
that
my
business
was
with
herself
it
seemed
almost
unbelievable
to
me
that
chance
should
take
this
turn
she
dismissed
this
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
continued
see
i
am
alone
she
said
come
with
me
show
me
my
way
i
will
pay
i
will
pay
anything
in
reason
actually
i
saw
her
fumble
at
her
purse
and
the
hot
blood
flew
to
my
forehead
what
you
ask
of
me
madam
is
impossible
said
i
with
what
courtesy
i
could
summon
you
oblige
me
now
to
tell
my
real
name
i
have
told
you
that
i
am
an
american
gentleman
nicholas
trist
we
of
this
country
do
not
offer
our
services
to
ladies
for
the
sake
of
pay
but
do
not
be
troubled
over
any
mistake
it
is
nothing
now
you
have
perhaps
had
some
little
adventure
in
which
you
do
not
wish
to
be
discovered
in
any
case
you
ask
me
to
shake
off
that
carriage
which
follows
us
if
that
is
all
madam
it
very
easily
can
be
arranged
hasten
then
she
said
i
leave
it
to
you
i
was
sure
you
knew
the
city
i
turned
and
gazed
back
through
the
rear
window
of
the
carriage
true
there
was
another
vehicle
following
us
we
were
by
this
time
nearly
at
the
end
of
washington
limited
pavements
it
would
be
simple
after
that
i
leaned
out
and
gave
our
driver
some
brief
orders
we
led
our
chase
across
the
valley
creeks
on
up
the
georgetown
hills
and
soon
as
possible
abandoned
the
last
of
the
pavement
and
took
to
the
turf
where
the
sound
of
our
wheels
was
dulled
rapidly
as
we
could
we
passed
on
up
the
hill
until
we
struck
a
side
street
where
there
was
no
paving
into
this
we
whipped
swiftly
following
the
flank
of
the
hill
our
going
which
was
all
of
earth
or
soft
turf
now
well
wetted
by
the
rain
when
at
last
we
reached
a
point
near
the
summit
of
the
hill
i
stopped
to
listen
hearing
nothing
i
told
the
driver
to
pull
down
the
hill
by
the
side
street
and
to
drive
slowly
when
we
finally
came
into
our
main
street
again
at
the
foot
of
the
georgetown
hills
not
far
from
the
little
creek
which
divided
that
settlement
from
the
main
city
i
could
hear
nowhere
any
sound
of
our
pursuer
madam
said
i
turning
to
her
i
think
we
may
safely
say
we
are
alone
what
now
is
your
wish
home
she
said
and
where
is
home
she
looked
at
me
keenly
for
a
time
as
though
to
read
some
thought
which
perhaps
she
saw
suggested
either
in
the
tone
of
my
voice
or
in
some
glimpse
she
might
have
caught
of
my
features
as
light
afforded
for
the
moment
she
made
no
answer
is
it
here
suddenly
i
asked
her
presenting
to
her
inspection
the
sealed
missive
which
i
bore
i
can
not
see
it
is
quite
dark
she
said
hurriedly
pardon
me
then
i
fumbled
for
my
case
of
lucifers
and
made
a
faint
light
by
which
she
might
read
the
flare
of
the
match
lit
up
her
face
perfectly
bringing
out
the
framing
roll
of
thick
dark
hair
from
which
as
a
high
light
in
a
mass
of
shadows
the
clear
and
yet
strong
features
of
her
face
showed
plainly
i
saw
the
long
lashes
drooped
above
her
dark
eyes
as
she
bent
over
studiously
at
first
the
inscription
gave
her
no
information
she
pursed
her
lips
and
shook
her
head
i
do
not
recognize
the
address
said
she
smiling
as
she
turned
toward
me
is
it
this
door
on
m
street
as
you
go
beyond
this
other
street
i
asked
her
come
think
then
i
thought
i
saw
the
flush
deepen
on
her
face
even
as
the
match
flickered
and
failed
i
leaned
out
of
the
door
and
called
to
the
negro
driver
home
now
boy
and
drive
fast
she
made
no
protest
chapter
v
one
of
the
women
in
the
case
there
is
a
woman
at
the
beginning
of
all
great
things
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
slowed
down
on
a
rough
brick
pavement
which
led
toward
what
then
was
an
outlying
portion
of
the
town
one
not
precisely
shabby
but
by
no
means
fashionable
there
was
a
single
lamp
stationed
at
the
mouth
of
the
narrow
little
street
as
we
advanced
i
could
see
outlined
upon
our
right
just
beyond
a
narrow
pavement
of
brick
a
low
and
not
more
than
house
or
rather
row
of
houses
tenements
for
the
middle
class
or
poor
i
might
have
said
the
neighborhood
i
knew
from
my
acquaintance
with
the
city
was
respectable
enough
yet
it
was
remote
and
occupied
by
none
of
any
station
certainly
it
was
not
to
be
considered
fit
residence
for
a
woman
such
as
this
who
sat
beside
me
i
admit
i
was
puzzled
the
strange
errand
of
my
chief
now
assumed
yet
more
mystery
in
spite
of
his
forewarnings
this
will
do
said
she
softly
at
length
the
driver
already
had
pulled
up
so
then
i
thought
she
had
been
here
before
but
why
could
this
indeed
be
her
residence
was
she
incognita
here
was
this
indeed
the
covert
embassy
of
england
there
was
no
escape
from
the
situation
as
it
lay
before
me
i
had
no
time
to
ponder
had
the
circumstances
been
otherwise
then
in
loyalty
to
elisabeth
i
would
have
handed
my
lady
out
bowed
her
farewell
at
her
own
gate
and
gone
away
pondering
only
the
adventures
into
which
the
beckoning
of
a
white
hand
and
the
rustling
of
a
silken
skirt
betimes
will
carry
a
man
if
he
dares
or
cares
to
go
now
i
might
not
leave
my
duty
was
here
this
was
my
message
here
was
she
for
whom
it
was
intended
and
this
was
the
place
which
i
was
to
have
sought
alone
i
needed
only
to
remember
that
my
business
was
not
with
helena
von
ritz
the
woman
beautiful
fascinating
perhaps
dangerous
as
they
said
of
her
but
with
the
baroness
von
ritz
in
the
belief
of
my
chief
the
ally
and
something
more
than
ally
of
pakenham
in
charge
of
fortunes
on
this
continent
i
did
remember
my
errand
and
the
gravity
of
it
i
did
not
remember
then
as
i
did
later
that
i
was
young
i
descended
at
the
edge
of
the
narrow
pavement
and
was
about
to
hand
her
out
at
the
step
but
as
i
glanced
down
i
saw
that
the
rain
had
left
a
puddle
of
mud
between
the
carriage
and
the
walk
pardon
madam
i
said
allow
me
to
make
a
light
for
you
the
footing
is
bad
i
lighted
another
lucifer
just
as
she
hesitated
at
the
step
she
made
as
though
to
put
out
her
right
foot
and
withdrew
it
again
she
shifted
and
extended
her
left
foot
i
faintly
saw
proof
that
nature
had
carried
out
her
scheme
of
symmetry
and
had
not
allowed
wrist
and
arm
to
forswear
themselves
i
saw
also
that
this
foot
was
clad
in
the
daintiest
of
white
slippers
suitable
enough
as
part
of
her
ball
costume
as
i
doubted
not
was
this
she
wore
she
took
my
hand
without
hesitation
and
rested
her
weight
upon
the
step
an
adorable
ankle
now
more
frankly
revealed
the
briefness
of
the
lucifers
was
merciful
or
merciless
as
you
like
a
wide
step
madam
be
careful
i
suggested
but
still
she
hesitated
a
laugh
half
of
annoyance
half
of
amusement
broke
from
her
lips
as
the
light
flickered
down
she
made
as
though
to
take
the
step
then
as
luck
would
have
it
a
bit
of
her
loose
drapery
which
was
made
in
the
and
fashion
of
the
time
caught
at
the
hinge
of
the
carriage
door
it
was
a
chance
glance
and
not
intent
on
my
part
but
i
saw
that
her
other
foot
was
stockinged
but
not
shod
i
beg
madam
pardon
i
said
gravely
looking
aside
but
she
has
perhaps
not
noticed
that
her
other
slipper
is
lost
in
the
carriage
nonsense
she
said
allow
me
your
hand
across
to
the
walk
please
it
is
lost
yes
but
lost
where
i
began
in
the
other
carriage
she
exclaimed
and
laughed
freely
half
hopping
she
was
across
the
walk
through
the
narrow
gate
and
up
at
the
door
before
i
could
either
offer
an
arm
or
ask
for
an
explanation
some
whim
however
seized
her
some
feeling
that
in
fairness
she
ought
to
tell
me
now
part
at
least
of
the
reason
for
her
summoning
me
to
her
aid
sir
she
said
even
as
her
hand
reached
up
to
the
door
knocker
i
admit
you
have
acted
as
a
gentleman
should
i
do
not
know
what
your
message
may
be
but
i
doubt
not
it
is
meant
for
me
since
you
have
this
much
claim
on
my
hospitality
even
at
this
hour
i
think
i
must
ask
you
to
step
within
there
may
be
some
answer
needed
madam
said
i
there
an
answer
needed
i
am
to
take
back
that
answer
i
know
that
this
message
is
to
the
baroness
von
ritz
i
guess
it
to
be
important
and
i
know
you
are
the
baroness
von
ritz
well
then
said
she
pulling
about
her
shoulders
the
light
wrap
she
wore
let
me
be
as
free
with
you
if
i
have
missed
one
shoe
i
have
not
lost
it
wholly
i
lost
the
slipper
in
a
way
not
quite
planned
on
the
program
it
hurt
my
foot
i
sought
to
adjust
it
behind
a
curtain
my
gentleman
of
mexico
was
in
wine
i
fled
leaving
my
escort
and
he
followed
i
called
to
you
you
know
the
rest
i
am
glad
you
are
less
in
wine
and
are
more
a
gentleman
i
do
not
yet
know
my
answer
madam
come
she
said
and
at
once
knocked
upon
the
door
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
surprise
which
awaited
me
when
at
last
the
door
swung
open
silently
at
the
hand
of
a
wrinkled
and
brown
old
not
one
of
our
colored
women
but
of
some
dark
foreign
race
the
faintest
trace
of
surprise
showed
on
the
old
woman
face
but
she
stepped
back
and
swung
the
door
wide
standing
submissively
waiting
for
orders
we
stood
now
facing
what
ought
to
have
been
a
narrow
and
dingy
little
room
in
a
low
row
of
dingy
buildings
each
of
two
stories
and
so
shallow
in
extent
as
perhaps
not
to
offer
roof
space
to
more
than
a
half
dozen
rooms
instead
of
what
should
have
been
however
there
was
a
wide
hall
wide
as
each
building
would
have
been
from
front
to
back
but
longer
than
a
half
dozen
of
them
would
have
been
i
did
not
know
then
what
i
learned
later
that
the
partitions
throughout
this
entire
row
had
been
removed
the
material
serving
to
fill
up
one
of
the
houses
at
the
farthest
extremity
of
the
row
there
was
thus
offered
a
long
and
narrow
room
or
series
of
rooms
which
now
i
saw
beyond
possibility
of
doubt
constituted
the
residence
of
this
strange
woman
whom
chance
had
sent
me
to
address
and
whom
still
stranger
chance
had
thrown
in
contact
with
me
even
before
my
errand
was
begun
she
stood
looking
at
me
a
smile
flitting
over
her
features
her
stockinged
foot
extended
toe
down
serving
to
balance
her
on
her
single
shoe
pardon
sir
she
said
hesitating
as
she
held
the
sealed
epistle
in
her
hand
you
know
me
perhaps
you
follow
me
i
do
not
know
tell
me
are
you
a
spy
of
that
man
pakenham
her
words
and
her
tone
startled
me
i
had
supposed
her
bound
to
sir
richard
by
ties
of
a
certain
sort
her
bluntness
and
independence
puzzled
me
as
much
as
her
splendid
beauty
enraptured
me
i
tried
to
forget
both
madam
i
am
spy
of
no
man
unless
i
am
such
at
order
of
my
chief
john
calhoun
of
the
united
states
senate
perhaps
if
madam
pleases
soon
of
tyler
cabinet
in
answer
she
turned
hobbled
to
a
tiny
marquetry
table
and
tossed
the
note
down
upon
it
unopened
i
waited
patiently
looking
about
me
meantime
i
discovered
that
the
windows
were
barred
with
narrow
slats
of
iron
within
although
covered
with
heavy
draperies
of
amber
silk
there
was
a
double
sheet
of
iron
covering
the
door
by
which
we
had
entered
your
cage
madam
i
inquired
i
do
not
blame
england
for
making
it
so
secret
and
strong
if
so
lovely
a
prisoner
were
mine
i
should
double
the
bars
the
swift
answer
to
my
presumption
came
in
the
flush
of
her
cheek
and
her
bitten
lip
she
caught
up
the
key
from
the
table
and
half
motioned
me
to
the
door
but
now
i
smiled
in
turn
and
pointed
to
the
unopened
note
on
the
table
you
will
pardon
me
madam
i
went
on
surely
it
is
no
disgrace
to
represent
either
england
or
america
they
are
not
at
war
why
should
we
be
we
gazed
steadily
at
each
other
the
old
servant
had
disappeared
when
at
length
her
mistress
chose
to
pick
up
my
unregarded
document
deliberately
she
broke
the
seal
and
read
an
instant
later
her
anger
gone
she
was
laughing
gaily
see
said
she
bubbling
over
with
her
mirth
i
pick
up
a
stranger
who
should
say
at
my
curb
my
apartments
are
forced
and
this
is
what
this
stranger
asks
that
i
shall
go
with
him
alone
and
otherwise
unattended
to
see
a
man
perhaps
high
in
your
government
but
a
stranger
to
me
at
his
own
oh
la
la
surely
these
americans
hold
me
high
assuredly
we
do
madam
i
answered
will
it
please
you
to
go
in
your
own
carriage
or
shall
i
return
with
one
for
you
she
put
her
hands
behind
her
back
holding
in
them
the
opened
message
from
my
chief
i
am
tired
i
am
bored
your
impudence
amuses
me
and
your
errand
is
not
your
fault
come
sit
down
you
have
been
good
to
me
before
you
go
i
shall
have
some
refreshment
brought
for
you
i
felt
a
sudden
call
upon
my
resources
as
i
found
myself
in
this
singular
situation
here
indeed
more
easily
reached
than
i
had
dared
hope
was
the
woman
in
the
case
but
only
half
of
my
errand
the
easier
half
was
done
chapter
vi
the
boudoir
of
the
baroness
a
woman
counsel
brought
us
first
to
wait
she
said
we
shall
have
candles
she
clapped
her
hands
sharply
and
again
there
entered
the
silent
old
who
obedient
to
a
gesture
proceeded
to
light
additional
candles
in
the
prism
stands
and
sconces
the
apartment
was
now
distinct
in
all
its
details
under
this
additional
flood
of
light
decently
as
i
might
i
looked
about
i
was
forced
to
stifle
the
exclamation
of
surprise
which
rose
to
my
lips
we
were
plain
folk
enough
in
washington
at
that
time
the
ceremonious
days
of
our
first
presidents
had
passed
for
the
democratic
time
of
jefferson
and
jackson
and
even
under
van
buren
there
had
been
little
change
from
the
simplicity
which
was
somewhat
our
boast
washington
itself
was
at
that
time
scarcely
more
than
an
overgrown
hamlet
not
in
the
least
to
be
compared
to
the
cosmopolitan
centers
which
made
the
capitals
of
the
old
world
formality
and
stateliness
of
a
certain
sort
we
had
but
of
luxury
we
knew
little
there
was
at
that
time
as
i
well
knew
no
state
apartment
in
the
city
which
in
sheer
splendor
could
for
a
moment
compare
with
this
secret
abode
of
a
woman
practically
unknown
here
certainly
was
european
luxury
transferred
to
our
shores
this
in
simple
washington
with
its
vast
white
unfinished
capitol
its
piecemeal
miles
of
mixed
residences
hotels
restaurants
and
hovels
i
fancied
stern
andrew
jackson
or
plain
john
calhoun
here
the
furniture
i
discovered
to
be
exquisite
in
detail
of
rosewood
and
mahogany
with
many
brass
chasings
and
carvings
after
the
fashion
of
the
empire
and
here
and
there
florid
ornamentation
following
that
of
the
court
of
the
earlier
louis
fanciful
little
clocks
with
carved
scrolls
stood
about
cupid
tapestries
had
replaced
the
original
tawdry
coverings
of
these
common
walls
and
what
had
once
been
a
dingy
fireplace
was
now
faced
with
embossed
tiles
never
made
in
america
there
were
paintings
in
oil
here
and
there
done
by
master
hands
as
one
could
tell
the
curtained
windows
spoke
eloquently
of
secrecy
here
and
there
a
divan
and
couch
showed
elaborate
care
in
comfort
beyond
a
grille
i
saw
an
alcove
doubtless
cut
through
the
original
partition
wall
between
two
of
these
humble
houses
and
within
this
stood
a
high
tester
bed
its
heavy
mahogany
posts
beautifully
carved
the
couch
itself
piled
deep
with
foundations
of
i
know
not
what
of
down
and
spread
most
daintily
with
a
coverlid
of
amber
satin
whose
edges
fringed
out
almost
to
the
floor
at
the
other
extremity
screened
off
as
in
a
distinct
apartment
there
stood
a
smaller
couch
a
napoleon
bed
with
carved
ends
furnished
more
simply
but
with
equal
richness
everywhere
was
the
air
not
only
of
comfort
but
of
ease
and
luxury
elegance
and
sensuousness
contending
i
needed
no
lesson
to
tell
me
that
this
was
not
an
ordinary
apartment
nor
occupied
by
an
ordinary
owner
one
resented
the
liberties
england
took
in
establishing
this
manner
of
ménage
in
our
simple
city
and
arrogantly
taking
for
granted
our
ignorance
regarding
it
but
none
the
less
one
was
forced
to
commend
the
thoroughness
shown
the
ceilings
of
course
remained
low
but
there
was
visible
no
trace
of
the
original
architecture
so
cunningly
had
the
interior
been
treated
as
i
have
said
the
dividing
partitions
had
all
been
removed
so
that
the
long
interior
practically
was
open
save
as
the
apartments
were
separated
by
curtains
or
grilles
the
floors
were
carpeted
thick
and
deep
silence
reigned
here
there
remained
no
trace
of
the
clumsy
comfort
which
had
sufficed
the
early
builder
here
was
no
longer
a
series
of
modest
homes
but
a
boudoir
which
might
have
been
the
gilded
cage
of
some
favorite
of
an
ancient
court
the
breath
and
flavor
of
this
suspicion
floated
in
every
drapery
swam
in
the
faint
perfume
which
filled
the
place
my
first
impression
was
that
of
surprise
my
second
as
i
have
said
a
feeling
of
resentment
at
the
presumption
which
installed
all
this
in
our
capital
of
washington
i
presume
my
thought
may
have
been
reflected
in
some
manner
in
my
face
i
heard
a
gentle
laugh
and
turned
about
she
sat
there
in
a
great
carved
chair
smiling
her
white
arms
stretched
out
on
the
rails
the
fingers
just
gently
curving
there
was
no
apology
for
her
situation
no
trace
of
alarm
or
shame
or
unreadiness
it
was
quite
obvious
she
was
merely
amused
i
was
in
no
way
ready
to
ratify
the
rumors
i
had
heard
regarding
her
she
had
thrown
back
over
the
rail
of
the
chair
the
rich
cloak
which
covered
her
in
the
carriage
and
sat
now
in
the
full
light
in
the
splendor
of
satin
and
lace
and
gems
her
arms
bare
her
throat
and
shoulders
white
and
bare
her
figure
recognized
graciously
by
every
line
of
a
superb
gowning
such
as
we
had
not
yet
learned
on
this
side
of
the
sea
never
had
i
seen
and
never
since
have
i
seen
a
more
splendid
instance
of
what
beauty
of
woman
may
be
she
did
not
speak
at
first
but
sat
and
smiled
studying
i
presume
to
find
what
stuff
i
was
made
of
seeing
this
i
pulled
myself
together
and
proceeded
briskly
to
my
business
my
employer
will
find
me
late
i
fear
my
dear
baroness
i
began
better
late
than
wholly
unsuccessful
she
rejoined
still
smiling
tell
me
my
friend
suppose
you
had
come
hither
and
knocked
at
my
door
perhaps
i
might
not
have
been
so
clumsy
i
essayed
confess
it
she
smiled
had
you
come
here
and
seen
the
exterior
only
you
would
have
felt
yourself
part
of
a
great
mistake
you
would
have
gone
away
perhaps
not
i
argued
i
have
much
confidence
in
my
acquaintance
with
his
own
purposes
and
his
own
facts
yet
i
confess
i
should
not
have
sought
madam
the
baroness
in
this
neighborhood
if
england
provides
us
so
beautiful
a
picture
why
could
she
not
afford
a
frame
more
suitable
why
is
england
so
secret
with
us
she
only
smiled
showing
two
rows
of
exceedingly
even
white
teeth
she
was
perfect
mistress
of
herself
in
years
she
was
not
my
equal
yet
i
could
see
that
at
the
time
i
did
scarcely
more
than
amuse
her
be
seated
pray
she
said
at
last
let
us
talk
over
this
matter
obedient
to
her
gesture
i
dropped
into
a
chair
opposite
to
her
she
herself
not
varying
her
posture
and
still
regarding
me
with
the
laugh
in
her
eyes
what
do
you
think
of
my
little
place
she
asked
finally
two
things
madam
said
i
half
sternly
if
it
belonged
to
a
man
and
to
a
minister
plenipotentiary
i
should
not
approve
it
if
it
belonged
to
a
lady
of
means
and
a
desire
to
see
the
lands
of
this
little
world
i
should
approve
it
very
much
she
looked
at
me
with
eyes
slightly
narrowed
but
no
trace
of
perturbation
crossed
her
face
i
saw
it
was
no
ordinary
woman
with
whom
we
had
to
do
but
i
went
on
in
any
case
and
at
all
events
i
should
say
that
the
bird
confined
in
such
a
cage
where
secrecy
is
so
imperative
would
at
times
find
weariness
would
in
fact
wish
escape
to
other
employment
you
madam
i
looked
at
her
directly
are
a
woman
of
so
much
intellect
that
you
could
not
be
content
merely
to
live
no
she
said
i
would
not
be
content
merely
to
live
precisely
therefore
since
to
make
life
worth
the
living
there
must
be
occasionally
a
trifle
of
spice
a
bit
of
adventure
either
for
man
or
woman
i
suggest
to
you
as
something
offering
amusement
this
little
journey
with
me
to
meet
my
chief
you
have
his
message
i
am
his
messenger
and
believe
me
quite
at
your
service
in
any
way
you
may
suggest
let
us
be
frank
if
you
are
agent
so
am
i
see
i
have
come
into
your
camp
dare
you
not
come
into
ours
come
it
is
an
adventure
to
see
a
tall
thin
old
man
in
a
and
a
red
woolen
nightcap
so
you
will
find
my
chief
and
in
apartments
much
different
from
these
she
took
up
the
missive
with
its
broken
seal
so
your
chief
as
you
call
him
asks
me
to
come
to
him
at
midnight
with
you
a
stranger
do
you
not
believe
in
charms
and
in
luck
in
evil
and
good
fortune
madam
i
asked
her
now
it
is
well
to
be
lucky
in
ordinary
circumstances
as
you
say
i
could
not
have
got
past
yonder
door
yet
here
i
am
what
does
it
augur
madam
but
it
is
night
precisely
could
you
go
to
the
office
of
a
united
states
senator
and
possible
cabinet
minister
in
broad
daylight
and
that
fact
not
be
known
could
he
come
to
your
apartments
in
broad
daylight
and
that
fact
not
be
known
what
would
man
pakenham
suspect
in
either
case
believe
me
my
master
is
wise
i
do
not
know
his
reason
but
he
knows
it
and
he
has
planned
best
to
gain
his
purpose
whatever
it
may
be
reason
must
teach
you
madam
that
night
this
night
this
hour
is
the
only
time
in
which
this
visit
could
be
made
naturally
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
come
here
if
you
go
to
him
he
will
ah
he
will
reverence
you
as
i
do
madam
great
necessity
sets
aside
conventions
sets
aside
everything
come
then
but
still
she
only
sat
and
smiled
at
me
i
felt
that
purple
and
amber
glow
the
emanation
of
her
personality
of
her
senses
creeping
around
me
again
as
she
leaned
forward
finally
her
parted
lips
again
disclosing
her
delicate
white
teeth
i
saw
the
little
heave
of
her
bosom
whether
in
laughter
or
emotion
i
could
not
tell
i
was
young
resenting
the
spell
which
i
felt
coming
upon
me
all
i
could
do
was
to
reiterate
my
demand
for
haste
she
was
not
in
the
least
impressed
by
this
come
she
said
i
am
pleased
with
these
americans
yes
i
am
not
displeased
with
this
little
adventure
i
rose
impatiently
and
walked
apart
in
the
room
you
can
not
evade
me
madam
so
easily
as
you
did
the
mexican
gentleman
who
followed
you
you
have
him
in
the
net
also
is
not
the
net
full
enough
never
she
said
her
head
swaying
slowly
from
side
to
side
her
face
inscrutable
am
i
not
a
woman
ah
am
i
not
madam
said
i
whirling
upon
her
let
me
at
least
alone
i
am
too
small
game
for
you
i
am
but
a
messenger
time
passes
let
us
arrive
at
our
business
what
would
you
do
if
i
refused
to
go
with
you
she
asked
still
smiling
at
me
she
was
waiting
for
the
spell
of
these
surroundings
the
spirit
of
this
place
to
do
their
work
with
me
perhaps
was
willing
to
take
her
time
with
charm
of
eye
and
arm
and
hair
and
curved
fingers
which
did
not
openly
invite
and
did
not
covertly
repel
but
i
saw
that
her
attitude
toward
me
held
no
more
than
that
of
bird
of
prey
and
some
little
creature
well
within
its
power
it
made
me
angry
to
be
so
rated
you
ask
me
what
i
should
do
i
retorted
savagely
i
shall
tell
you
first
what
i
do
if
you
continue
your
refusal
i
will
you
with
me
and
so
keep
my
agreement
with
my
chief
keep
away
from
the
bell
rope
remain
silent
do
not
move
you
should
go
if
i
had
to
carry
you
there
in
a
sack
because
that
is
my
errand
oh
listen
at
him
threaten
she
laughed
still
and
he
despises
my
poor
little
castle
here
in
the
side
street
where
half
the
time
i
am
so
lonely
what
would
monsieur
do
if
monsieur
were
in
my
place
and
if
i
were
in
monsieur
place
but
bah
you
would
not
have
me
following
in
the
first
hour
we
met
boy
i
flushed
again
hotly
at
this
last
word
madam
may
discontinue
the
thought
of
my
boyhood
i
am
older
than
she
but
if
you
ask
me
what
i
would
do
with
a
woman
if
i
followed
her
or
if
she
followed
me
then
i
shall
tell
you
if
i
owned
this
place
and
all
in
it
i
would
tear
down
every
picture
from
these
walls
every
silken
cover
from
yonder
couches
i
would
rip
out
these
walls
and
put
back
the
ones
that
once
were
here
you
madam
should
be
taken
out
of
luxury
and
daintiness
go
on
she
clapped
her
hands
for
the
first
time
kindling
and
dropping
her
annoying
air
of
patronizing
me
go
on
i
like
you
now
tell
me
what
americans
do
with
women
that
they
love
i
have
heard
they
are
savages
a
house
of
logs
far
out
in
the
countries
that
i
know
would
do
for
you
madam
i
went
on
hotly
you
should
forget
the
touch
of
silk
and
lace
no
neighbor
you
should
know
until
i
was
willing
any
man
who
followed
you
should
meet
until
you
loved
me
all
you
could
and
said
so
and
proved
it
i
would
wring
your
neck
with
my
hands
if
necessary
until
you
loved
me
excellent
what
then
then
madam
the
baroness
i
would
in
turn
build
you
a
palace
one
of
logs
and
would
make
you
a
most
excellent
couch
of
the
husks
of
corn
you
should
cook
at
my
fireplace
and
for
she
smiled
slowly
past
me
at
me
pray
be
seated
she
said
you
interest
me
it
is
late
i
reiterated
come
must
i
do
some
of
these
things
force
you
into
obedience
carry
you
away
in
a
sack
my
master
can
not
wait
don
yturrio
of
mexico
on
the
other
hand
she
mused
promised
me
not
violence
but
more
jewels
idiot
indeed
i
rejoined
in
contempt
an
american
savage
would
give
you
but
one
gown
and
that
of
your
own
weave
you
could
make
it
up
as
you
liked
but
come
now
i
have
no
more
time
to
lose
ah
also
idiot
she
murmured
do
you
not
see
that
i
must
reclothe
myself
before
i
could
go
with
you
that
is
to
say
if
i
choose
to
go
with
you
now
as
i
was
saying
my
ardent
mexican
promises
thus
and
so
my
lord
of
england
ah
well
they
may
be
pardoned
suppose
i
might
listen
to
such
suits
might
there
not
be
some
life
for
me
some
life
with
events
on
the
other
hand
what
of
interest
could
america
offer
i
have
told
you
what
life
america
could
give
you
i
imagined
men
were
but
men
wherever
found
she
went
on
but
what
you
say
interests
me
i
declare
to
you
again
a
woman
is
a
woman
too
i
fancy
she
always
wants
one
thing
to
be
all
the
world
to
one
man
quite
true
i
answered
better
that
than
part
of
the
world
to
one
or
two
and
the
opposite
of
it
is
yet
more
true
when
a
woman
is
all
the
world
to
a
man
she
despises
him
but
yes
i
should
like
that
experience
of
being
a
cook
in
a
cabin
and
being
bruised
and
broken
and
choked
she
smiled
lazily
extending
her
flawless
arms
and
looking
down
at
them
at
all
of
her
splendid
figure
as
though
in
interested
examination
i
am
alone
so
much
so
bored
she
went
on
and
sir
richard
pakenham
is
so
very
very
fat
ah
god
you
can
not
guess
how
fat
he
is
but
you
you
are
not
fat
she
looked
me
over
critically
to
my
great
uneasiness
all
the
more
reason
for
doing
as
i
have
suggested
madam
for
calhoun
is
not
even
so
fat
as
i
am
this
little
interview
with
my
chief
i
doubt
not
will
prove
of
interest
indeed
i
went
on
seriously
and
intently
i
venture
to
say
this
much
without
presuming
on
my
station
the
talk
which
you
will
have
with
my
chief
will
show
you
things
you
have
never
known
give
you
an
interest
in
living
which
perhaps
you
have
not
felt
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
will
find
much
in
common
between
you
and
my
master
i
speak
not
to
the
agent
of
england
but
to
the
lady
helena
von
ritz
he
is
old
she
went
on
he
is
very
old
his
face
is
thin
and
bloodless
and
fleshless
he
is
old
madam
i
said
his
mind
is
young
his
purpose
young
his
ambition
young
and
his
country
is
young
is
not
the
youth
of
all
these
things
still
your
own
she
made
no
answer
but
sat
musing
drumming
lightly
on
the
chair
arm
i
was
reaching
for
her
cloak
then
at
once
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
stockinged
foot
the
toe
of
which
slightly
protruded
from
beneath
her
ball
gown
she
saw
the
glance
and
laughed
poor
feet
she
said
ah
pauvres
pieds
you
would
like
to
see
them
bruised
by
the
hard
going
in
some
heathen
country
see
you
have
no
carriage
and
mine
is
gone
i
have
not
even
a
pair
of
shoes
go
look
under
the
bed
beyond
i
obeyed
her
gladly
enough
under
the
fringe
of
the
satin
counterpane
i
found
a
box
of
boots
slippers
all
manner
of
footwear
daintily
and
neatly
arranged
taking
out
a
pair
to
my
fancy
i
carried
them
out
and
knelt
before
her
then
madam
said
i
since
you
insist
on
this
i
shall
choose
america
is
not
europe
our
feet
here
have
rougher
going
and
must
be
shod
for
it
allow
me
without
the
least
hesitation
in
the
world
or
the
least
immodesty
she
half
protruded
the
foot
which
still
retained
its
slipper
as
i
removed
this
latter
through
some
gay
impulse
whose
nature
i
did
not
pause
to
analyze
i
half
mechanically
thrust
it
into
the
side
pocket
of
my
coat
this
shall
be
security
said
i
that
what
you
speak
with
my
master
shall
be
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
there
was
a
curious
deeper
red
in
her
cheek
i
saw
her
bosom
beat
the
faster
rhythm
quite
agreed
she
answered
but
she
motioned
me
away
taking
the
stout
boot
in
her
own
hand
and
turning
aside
as
she
fastened
it
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
me
now
and
again
while
thus
engaged
tell
me
she
said
gently
what
security
do
have
you
come
by
my
invitation
it
is
true
but
none
the
less
an
intrusion
into
my
apartments
you
demand
of
me
something
which
no
man
has
a
right
to
demand
because
i
am
disposed
to
be
gracious
and
because
i
am
much
disposed
to
be
and
because
pakenham
is
fat
i
am
willing
to
take
into
consideration
what
you
ask
i
have
never
seen
a
thin
gentleman
in
a
woolen
nightcap
and
i
am
curious
but
no
gentleman
plays
games
with
ladies
in
which
the
dice
are
loaded
for
himself
come
what
security
shall
have
i
did
not
pretend
to
understand
her
perhaps
after
all
we
all
had
been
misinformed
regarding
her
i
could
not
tell
but
her
spirit
of
her
good
fellowship
her
courage
quite
aside
from
her
personal
charm
had
now
begun
to
impress
me
madam
said
i
feeling
in
my
pocket
no
heathen
has
much
of
this
world
goods
all
my
possessions
would
not
furnish
one
of
these
rooms
i
can
not
offer
gems
as
does
señor
yturrio
but
would
this
be
of
service
until
that
will
leave
him
and
me
with
a
slipper
each
it
is
with
reluctance
i
pledge
to
return
mine
by
chance
i
had
felt
in
my
pocket
a
little
object
which
i
had
placed
there
that
very
day
for
quite
another
purpose
it
was
only
a
little
trinket
of
indian
manufacture
which
i
had
intended
to
give
elisabeth
that
very
evening
a
sort
of
cloak
clasp
originally
made
as
an
indian
blanket
fastening
with
two
round
discs
ground
out
of
shells
and
connected
by
beaded
thongs
i
had
got
it
among
the
tribes
of
the
far
upper
plains
who
doubtless
obtained
the
shells
in
their
strange
savage
barter
in
some
way
from
the
tribes
of
florida
or
texas
who
sometimes
trafficked
in
shells
which
found
their
way
as
far
north
as
the
saskatchewan
the
trinket
was
curious
though
of
small
value
the
baroness
looked
at
it
with
interest
how
it
reminds
me
of
this
heathen
country
she
said
is
this
all
that
your
art
can
do
in
jewelry
yet
it
beautiful
come
will
you
not
give
it
to
me
until
madam
no
longer
i
can
not
promise
it
longer
i
must
unfortunately
have
it
back
when
i
send
a
messenger
i
shall
hardly
come
myself
madam
ah
she
scoffed
then
it
belongs
to
another
woman
yes
it
is
promised
to
another
then
this
is
to
be
the
last
time
we
meet
i
do
not
doubt
it
are
you
not
sorry
naturally
madam
she
sighed
laughing
as
she
did
so
yet
i
could
not
evade
seeing
the
curious
color
on
her
cheek
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
laces
over
her
bosom
utterly
satisfied
with
life
as
it
had
come
to
her
without
illusion
as
to
life
absorbed
in
the
great
game
of
living
and
adventuring
so
i
should
have
described
her
then
why
should
her
heart
beat
one
stroke
the
faster
now
i
dismissed
that
question
and
rebuked
my
eyes
which
i
found
continually
turning
toward
her
she
motioned
to
a
little
table
near
by
put
the
slipper
there
she
said
your
little
neck
clasp
also
again
i
obeyed
her
stand
there
she
said
motioning
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
and
i
did
so
now
said
she
looking
at
me
gravely
i
am
going
with
you
to
see
this
man
whom
you
call
your
chief
this
old
and
ugly
man
thin
and
weazened
with
no
blood
in
him
and
a
woolen
nightcap
which
is
perhaps
red
i
shall
not
tell
you
whether
i
go
of
my
own
wish
or
because
you
wish
it
but
i
need
soberly
to
tell
you
this
secrecy
is
as
necessary
for
me
as
for
you
the
favor
may
mean
as
much
on
one
side
as
on
the
other
i
shall
not
tell
you
why
but
we
shall
play
fair
until
as
you
say
perhaps
after
that
after
that
on
guard
very
well
on
guard
suppose
i
do
not
like
this
other
woman
madam
you
could
not
help
it
all
the
world
loves
her
do
you
with
my
life
how
devoted
very
well
then
she
took
up
the
indian
bauble
turning
to
examine
it
at
the
nearest
candle
sconce
even
as
i
thrust
the
dainty
little
slipper
of
white
satin
again
into
the
pocket
of
my
coat
i
was
uncomfortable
i
wished
this
talk
of
elisabeth
had
not
come
up
i
liked
very
little
to
leave
elisabeth
property
in
another
hands
dissatisfied
i
turned
from
the
table
not
noticing
for
more
than
an
instant
a
little
crumpled
roll
of
paper
which
as
i
was
vaguely
conscious
now
appeared
on
its
smooth
marquetry
top
but
see
she
said
you
are
just
like
a
man
after
all
and
an
unmarried
man
at
that
i
can
not
go
through
the
streets
in
this
costume
excuse
me
for
a
moment
she
was
off
on
the
instant
into
the
alcove
where
the
great
bed
stood
she
drew
the
curtains
i
heard
her
humming
to
herself
as
she
passed
to
and
fro
saw
the
flare
of
a
light
as
it
rose
beyond
once
or
twice
she
thrust
a
laughing
face
between
the
curtains
held
tight
together
with
her
hands
as
she
asked
me
some
question
mocking
me
still
amused
yet
still
as
i
thought
more
enigmatic
than
before
madam
i
said
at
last
i
would
i
might
dwell
here
for
ever
but
you
are
slow
the
night
passes
come
my
master
will
be
waiting
he
is
ill
i
fear
he
can
not
sleep
i
know
how
intent
he
is
on
meeting
you
i
beg
you
to
oblige
an
old
a
dying
man
and
you
monsieur
she
mocked
at
me
from
beyond
the
curtain
are
intent
only
on
getting
rid
of
me
are
you
not
adventurer
enough
to
forget
that
other
woman
for
one
night
in
her
hands
those
of
a
mysterious
foreign
woman
i
had
placed
this
little
trinket
which
i
had
got
among
the
western
tribes
for
elisabeth
a
woman
of
my
own
people
the
woman
to
whom
my
pledge
had
been
given
not
for
return
on
any
morrow
i
made
no
answer
excepting
to
walk
up
and
down
the
floor
at
last
she
came
out
from
between
the
curtains
garbed
more
suitably
for
the
errand
which
was
now
before
us
a
long
dark
cloak
covered
her
shoulders
on
her
head
there
rested
a
dainty
bonnet
whose
jetted
edges
shone
in
the
candle
light
as
she
moved
toward
me
she
was
exquisite
in
every
detail
beautiful
as
mind
of
man
could
wish
that
much
was
sure
must
be
admitted
by
any
man
i
dared
not
look
at
her
i
called
to
mind
the
taunt
of
those
old
men
that
i
was
young
there
was
in
my
soul
vast
relief
that
she
was
not
delaying
me
here
longer
in
this
place
of
spells
that
in
this
almost
providential
way
my
errand
had
met
success
she
paused
for
an
instant
drawing
on
a
pair
of
the
short
gloves
of
the
mode
then
correct
do
you
know
why
i
am
to
go
on
this
heathen
errand
she
demanded
i
shook
my
head
calhoun
wishes
to
know
whether
he
shall
go
to
the
cabinet
of
your
man
tyler
over
there
in
that
barn
you
call
your
white
house
i
suppose
calhoun
wishes
to
know
how
he
can
serve
mr
tyler
i
laughed
at
this
serve
him
i
exclaimed
rather
say
him
him
him
yes
she
nodded
i
began
to
see
another
and
graver
side
of
her
nature
yes
it
is
of
course
texas
i
did
not
see
fit
to
make
answer
to
this
if
your
master
as
you
call
him
takes
the
portfolio
with
tyler
it
is
to
annex
texas
she
repeated
sharply
is
not
that
true
still
i
would
not
answer
come
i
said
and
he
asks
me
to
come
to
him
so
that
he
may
decide
this
awoke
me
no
man
decides
for
john
calhoun
madam
i
said
you
may
advance
facts
but
will
decide
still
she
went
on
and
texas
not
annexed
is
a
menace
without
her
you
heathen
people
would
not
present
a
solid
front
would
you
madam
has
had
much
to
do
with
affairs
of
state
i
said
she
went
on
as
though
i
had
not
spoken
and
if
you
were
divided
in
your
southern
section
england
would
have
all
the
greater
chance
england
you
know
says
she
wishes
slavery
abolished
she
says
that
england
many
things
i
ventured
the
hypocrite
of
the
nations
flashed
out
this
singular
woman
at
me
suddenly
as
though
diplomacy
need
be
hypocrisy
thus
sir
richard
of
england
forgets
his
place
his
protestations
he
does
not
even
know
that
mexico
has
forgotten
its
duty
also
sir
you
were
not
at
our
little
ball
so
you
could
not
see
that
very
fat
sir
richard
paying
his
bored
to
doña
lucrezia
so
i
am
left
alone
and
would
be
bored
but
for
you
in
return
a
slight
jest
on
sir
richard
i
will
teach
him
that
no
fat
gentleman
should
pay
even
bored
attentions
to
a
lady
who
soon
will
be
fat
when
his
obvious
duty
should
call
him
otherwhere
bah
is
as
though
i
myself
were
fat
which
is
not
true
you
go
too
deep
for
me
madam
i
said
i
am
but
a
simple
messenger
at
the
same
time
i
saw
how
admirably
things
were
shaping
for
us
all
a
woman
jealousy
was
with
us
and
so
a
woman
whim
there
you
have
the
measure
of
england
sincerity
she
went
on
with
contempt
england
is
selfish
that
is
all
do
you
not
suppose
i
have
something
to
do
besides
feeding
a
canary
to
read
to
study
that
is
my
pleasure
i
know
your
politics
here
in
america
suppose
you
invade
texas
as
the
threat
is
with
troops
of
the
united
states
before
texas
is
a
member
of
the
union
does
that
not
mean
you
are
again
at
war
with
mexico
and
does
that
not
mean
that
you
are
also
at
war
with
england
come
do
you
not
know
some
of
those
things
with
my
hand
on
my
heart
madam
i
asserted
solemnly
all
i
know
is
that
you
must
go
to
see
my
master
calhoun
wants
you
america
needs
you
i
beg
you
to
do
what
kindness
you
may
to
the
heathen
moi
and
you
i
answered
you
shall
have
such
reward
as
you
have
never
dreamed
in
all
your
life
how
do
you
mean
i
doubt
not
the
reward
for
a
soul
which
is
as
keen
and
able
as
your
heart
is
warm
madam
come
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
you
think
perhaps
nor
are
you
a
fool
you
are
a
great
woman
a
wonderful
woman
with
head
and
heart
both
madam
as
well
as
beauty
such
as
i
had
never
dreamed
you
are
a
strange
woman
madam
you
are
a
genius
madam
if
you
please
so
i
say
you
are
capable
of
a
reward
and
a
great
one
you
may
find
it
in
the
gratitude
of
a
people
what
could
this
country
give
more
than
mexico
or
england
she
smiled
quizzically
much
more
madam
your
reward
shall
be
in
the
later
thought
of
many
homes
homes
built
of
logs
with
dingy
fireplaces
and
couches
of
husks
in
them
far
out
all
across
this
continent
housing
many
people
many
happy
citizens
men
who
will
make
their
own
laws
and
enforce
them
man
and
man
alike
madam
it
is
the
spirit
of
democracy
which
calls
on
you
it
is
not
any
political
party
nor
the
representative
of
one
it
is
not
calhoun
it
is
not
calhoun
only
puts
before
you
the
summons
of
of
what
of
that
spirit
of
democracy
she
stood
one
hand
ungloved
a
finger
at
her
lips
her
eyes
glowing
i
am
glad
you
came
she
said
on
the
whole
i
am
also
glad
i
came
upon
my
foolish
errand
here
to
america
madam
said
i
my
hand
at
the
fastening
of
the
door
we
have
exchanged
pledges
now
we
exchange
places
it
is
you
who
are
the
messenger
not
myself
there
is
a
message
in
your
hands
i
know
not
whether
you
ever
served
a
monarchy
come
you
shall
see
that
our
republic
has
neither
secrets
nor
hypocrisies
on
the
instant
she
was
not
shrewd
and
tactful
woman
of
the
world
not
student
but
once
more
coquette
and
woman
of
impulse
she
looked
at
me
with
mockery
and
invitation
alike
in
her
great
dark
eyes
even
as
i
threw
down
the
chain
at
the
door
and
opened
it
wide
for
her
to
pass
is
that
my
only
reward
she
asked
smiling
as
she
fumbled
at
a
glove
in
reply
i
bent
and
kissed
the
fingers
of
her
ungloved
hand
they
were
so
warm
and
tender
that
i
had
been
different
than
i
was
had
i
not
felt
the
blood
tingle
in
all
my
body
in
the
impulse
of
the
moment
to
do
more
than
kiss
her
fingers
had
i
done
so
had
i
not
thought
of
elisabeth
then
as
in
my
heart
i
still
believe
the
flag
of
england
would
rule
oregon
and
the
pacific
and
it
would
float
along
the
rio
grande
and
it
would
menace
a
divided
north
and
south
instead
of
respecting
a
strong
and
indivisible
union
which
owns
one
flag
and
dreads
none
in
the
world
chapter
vii
regarding
elisabeth
without
woman
the
two
extremities
of
this
life
would
be
destitute
of
succor
and
the
middle
would
be
devoid
of
in
some
forgotten
garret
of
this
country
as
i
do
not
doubt
yellowed
with
age
stained
and
indistinguishable
lost
among
relics
of
another
day
there
may
be
records
of
that
interview
between
two
strange
personalities
john
calhoun
and
helena
von
ritz
in
the
arrangement
of
which
i
played
the
part
above
described
i
was
not
at
that
time
privileged
to
have
much
more
than
a
guess
at
the
nature
of
the
interview
indeed
other
things
now
occupied
my
mind
i
was
very
much
in
love
with
elisabeth
churchill
of
these
matters
i
need
to
make
some
mention
my
father
plantation
was
one
of
the
old
ones
in
maryland
that
of
the
churchills
lay
across
a
low
range
of
mountains
and
in
another
county
from
us
but
our
families
had
long
been
friends
i
had
known
elisabeth
from
the
time
she
was
a
tall
slim
girl
boon
companion
ever
to
her
father
old
daniel
churchill
for
her
mother
she
had
lost
when
she
was
still
young
the
churchills
maintained
a
city
establishment
in
the
environs
of
washington
itself
although
that
was
not
much
removed
from
their
plantation
in
the
old
state
of
maryland
elmhurst
this
washington
estate
was
called
and
it
was
well
known
there
with
its
straight
road
approaching
and
its
great
trees
and
its
halls
whereby
the
road
itself
seemed
to
run
straight
through
the
house
and
appear
beyond
and
its
tall
white
pillars
and
hospitable
galleries
now
in
the
springtime
enclosed
in
green
i
need
not
state
that
now
having
finished
the
business
of
the
day
or
rather
of
the
night
elmhurst
home
of
elisabeth
was
my
immediate
mecca
i
had
clad
myself
as
well
as
i
could
in
the
fashion
of
my
time
and
flattered
myself
as
i
looked
in
my
little
mirror
that
i
made
none
such
bad
figure
of
a
man
i
was
tall
enough
and
straight
thin
with
long
hours
afoot
or
in
the
saddle
bronzed
to
a
good
color
and
if
health
did
not
show
on
my
face
at
least
i
felt
it
myself
in
the
lightness
of
my
step
in
the
contentedness
of
my
heart
with
all
of
life
in
my
general
assurance
that
all
in
the
world
meant
well
toward
me
and
that
everything
in
the
world
would
do
well
by
me
we
shall
see
what
license
there
was
for
this
as
to
elisabeth
churchill
it
might
have
been
in
line
with
a
had
she
generally
been
known
as
betty
but
betty
she
never
was
called
although
that
diminutive
was
applied
to
her
aunt
jennings
twice
as
large
as
she
after
whom
she
had
been
named
betty
implies
a
snub
nose
elisabeth
was
and
straight
betty
runs
for
a
saucy
mouth
and
a
short
one
elisabeth
was
red
and
curved
but
firm
and
wide
enough
for
strength
and
charity
as
well
betty
spells
round
eyes
with
brows
arched
above
them
as
though
in
query
and
curiosity
the
eyes
of
elisabeth
were
long
her
brows
long
and
straight
and
delicately
fine
a
betty
might
even
have
red
hair
elisabeth
was
brown
in
most
lights
and
so
liquid
smooth
that
almost
i
was
disposed
to
call
it
dense
rather
than
thick
betty
would
seem
to
indicate
a
nature
impulsive
gay
and
free
from
care
on
the
other
hand
it
was
to
be
said
of
elisabeth
that
she
was
logical
beyond
her
kind
a
trait
which
she
got
from
her
mother
a
daughter
of
old
judge
henry
gooch
of
our
superior
court
yet
disposed
as
she
always
was
to
be
logical
in
her
conclusions
the
great
characteristic
of
elisabeth
was
serenity
consideration
and
charity
with
all
this
there
appeared
sometimes
at
the
surface
of
nature
that
fire
and
lightness
and
impulsiveness
which
she
got
from
her
father
daniel
churchill
whether
she
was
wholly
reserved
and
reasonable
or
wholly
warm
and
impulsive
i
long
as
i
had
known
and
loved
her
never
was
quite
sure
something
held
me
away
something
called
me
forward
so
that
i
was
always
baffled
and
yet
always
eager
god
wot
i
suppose
this
is
the
way
of
women
at
times
i
have
been
impatient
with
it
knowing
my
own
mind
well
enough
at
least
now
in
my
trousers
and
my
long
blue
coat
and
my
deep
embroidered
waistcoat
and
my
high
stock
my
shining
boots
and
my
tall
beaver
i
made
my
way
on
my
horse
up
to
the
gates
of
old
elmhurst
and
as
i
rode
i
pondered
and
i
dreamed
but
miss
elisabeth
was
not
at
home
it
seemed
her
father
daniel
churchill
rather
portly
and
now
just
a
trifle
red
of
face
met
me
instead
it
was
not
an
encounter
for
which
i
devoutly
wished
but
one
which
i
knew
it
was
the
right
of
both
of
us
to
expect
ere
long
seeing
the
occasion
propitious
i
plunged
at
once
medias
part
of
the
time
explanatory
again
apologetic
and
yet
again
i
trust
assertive
although
always
blundering
and
red
and
awkward
i
told
the
father
of
my
intended
of
my
own
wishes
my
prospects
and
my
plans
he
listened
to
me
gravely
and
it
seemed
to
me
with
none
of
that
enthusiasm
which
i
would
have
welcomed
as
to
my
family
he
knew
enough
as
to
my
prospects
he
questioned
me
my
record
was
not
unfamiliar
to
him
so
gaining
confidence
at
last
under
the
insistence
of
what
i
knew
were
worthy
motives
and
which
certainly
were
irresistible
of
themselves
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
asked
him
if
we
might
not
soon
make
an
end
of
this
and
taking
chances
as
they
were
allow
my
wedding
with
elisabeth
to
take
place
at
no
very
distant
date
why
as
to
that
of
course
i
do
not
know
what
my
girl
will
say
went
on
daniel
churchill
pursing
up
his
lips
he
looked
not
wholly
lovable
to
me
as
he
sat
in
his
big
chair
i
wondered
that
he
should
be
father
of
so
fair
a
human
being
as
elisabeth
oh
of
course
that
i
answered
miss
elisabeth
and
i
the
skeesicks
he
exclaimed
i
thought
she
told
me
everything
i
think
miss
elisabeth
tells
no
one
quite
everything
i
ventured
i
confess
she
has
kept
me
almost
as
much
in
the
dark
as
yourself
sir
but
i
only
wanted
to
ask
if
after
i
have
seen
her
and
if
i
should
gain
her
consent
to
an
early
day
you
would
not
waive
any
objections
on
your
own
part
and
allow
the
matter
to
go
forward
as
soon
as
possible
in
answer
to
this
he
arose
from
his
chair
and
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
his
back
turned
to
me
i
could
not
call
his
reception
of
my
suggestion
enthusiastic
but
at
last
he
turned
i
presume
that
our
two
families
might
send
you
young
people
a
sack
of
meal
or
a
side
of
bacon
now
and
then
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
he
said
i
could
not
call
this
speech
joyous
there
are
said
to
be
risks
in
any
union
sir
i
ventured
to
say
i
admit
i
do
not
follow
you
in
contemplating
any
risk
whatever
if
either
you
or
your
daughter
doubts
my
loyalty
or
affection
then
i
should
say
certainly
it
were
wise
to
end
all
this
but
and
i
fancied
i
straightened
perceptibly
i
think
that
might
perhaps
be
left
to
miss
elisabeth
herself
after
all
dan
churchill
was
obliged
to
yield
as
fathers
have
been
obliged
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
at
last
he
told
me
i
might
take
my
fate
in
my
own
hands
and
go
my
way
trust
the
instinct
of
lovers
to
bring
them
together
i
was
quite
confident
that
at
that
hour
i
should
find
elisabeth
and
her
aunt
in
the
big
east
room
at
the
president
reception
the
former
looking
on
with
her
uncompromising
eyes
at
the
little
pageant
which
on
reception
days
regularly
went
forward
there
my
conclusion
was
correct
i
found
a
boy
to
hold
my
horse
in
front
of
gautier
café
then
i
hastened
off
across
the
intervening
blocks
and
through
the
grounds
of
the
white
house
in
which
presently
having
edged
through
the
throng
in
the
i
found
myself
in
that
inane
procession
of
individuals
who
passed
by
in
order
each
to
receive
the
limp
handshake
the
mechanical
bow
and
the
perfunctory
smite
of
president
tyler
rather
a
tall
active
man
and
of
very
decent
presence
although
his
thin
shrunken
cheeks
and
his
cold
eye
left
little
quality
of
magnetism
in
his
personality
it
was
not
new
to
me
of
course
this
pageant
although
it
never
lacked
of
interest
there
were
in
the
throng
representatives
of
all
america
as
it
was
then
a
strange
crude
blending
of
refinement
and
vulgarity
of
ease
and
poverty
of
luxury
and
thrift
we
had
there
merchants
from
philadelphia
and
new
york
politicians
from
canny
new
england
and
not
less
canny
pennsylvania
at
times
there
came
from
the
old
world
men
representative
of
an
easier
and
more
opulent
life
who
did
not
always
trouble
to
suppress
their
smiles
at
us
moving
among
these
were
ladies
from
every
state
of
our
union
picturesque
enough
in
their
wide
flowered
skirts
and
their
flaring
bonnets
and
their
silken
mitts
each
rivalling
the
other
in
the
elegance
of
her
mien
and
all
unconsciously
outdone
in
charm
perhaps
by
some
demure
quakeress
in
white
and
dove
color
herself
looking
askance
on
all
this
form
and
ceremony
yet
unwilling
to
leave
the
nation
capital
without
shaking
the
hand
of
the
chief
add
to
these
gaunt
frontiersmen
from
across
the
alleghanies
politicians
from
the
south
pompous
immaculately
clad
uneasy
tradesmen
from
this
or
the
other
corner
of
their
commonwealth
a
motley
throng
indeed
a
certain
air
of
gloom
at
this
time
hung
over
official
washington
for
the
minds
of
all
were
still
oppressed
by
the
memory
of
that
fatal
accident
the
explosion
of
the
great
cannon
peacemaker
on
board
the
war
vessel
which
had
killed
upshur
our
secretary
of
state
with
others
and
had
at
one
blow
come
so
near
to
depriving
this
government
of
its
head
and
his
official
family
the
number
of
prominent
lives
thus
ended
or
endangered
being
appalling
to
contemplate
it
was
this
accident
which
had
called
calhoun
forward
at
a
national
juncture
of
the
most
extreme
delicacy
and
the
utmost
importance
in
spite
of
the
general
mourning
however
the
informal
receptions
at
the
white
house
were
not
wholly
discontinued
and
the
administration
unsettled
as
it
was
and
fronted
by
the
gravest
of
diplomatic
problems
made
such
show
of
dignity
and
even
cheerfulness
as
it
might
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
pass
in
the
long
procession
and
to
shake
the
hand
of
tyler
that
done
i
gazed
about
the
great
room
carefully
the
different
little
groups
which
were
accustomed
to
form
after
the
ceremonial
part
of
the
visit
was
over
i
saw
many
whom
i
knew
i
forgot
them
for
in
a
far
corner
where
a
flood
of
light
came
through
the
trailing
vines
that
shielded
the
outer
window
my
anxious
eyes
discovered
the
object
of
my
quest
elisabeth
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
never
known
her
so
fair
as
she
was
that
morning
in
the
great
east
room
of
the
white
house
elisabeth
was
rather
taller
than
the
average
woman
and
of
that
splendid
southern
figure
slender
but
strong
which
makes
perhaps
the
best
representative
of
our
american
beauty
she
was
very
bravely
arrayed
in
her
best
lawn
made
wide
and
full
as
was
the
custom
of
the
time
but
not
so
clumsily
gathered
at
the
waist
as
some
and
so
serving
not
wholly
to
conceal
her
natural
comeliness
of
figure
her
bonnet
she
had
removed
i
could
see
the
sunlight
on
the
ripples
of
her
brown
hair
and
the
shadows
which
lay
above
her
eyes
as
she
turned
to
face
me
and
the
slow
pink
which
crept
into
her
cheeks
dignified
always
and
reserved
was
elisabeth
churchill
but
now
i
hope
it
was
not
wholly
conceit
which
led
me
to
feel
that
perhaps
the
warmth
the
glow
of
the
air
caught
while
riding
under
the
open
sky
the
sight
of
the
many
budding
roses
of
our
city
the
scent
of
the
blossoms
which
even
then
came
through
the
lattice
the
meeting
even
with
myself
so
lately
returned
something
at
least
of
this
had
caused
an
awakening
in
her
girl
heart
something
i
say
i
do
not
know
what
gave
her
greeting
to
me
more
warmth
than
was
usual
with
her
my
own
heart
eager
enough
to
break
bounds
answered
in
kind
we
stood
blushing
like
children
as
our
hands
touched
forgotten
in
that
assemblage
of
washington
pomp
and
circumstance
how
do
you
do
was
all
i
could
find
to
say
and
how
do
you
do
was
all
i
could
catch
for
answer
although
i
saw
in
a
fleeting
way
a
glimpse
of
a
dimple
hid
in
elisabeth
cheek
she
never
showed
it
save
when
pleased
i
have
never
seen
a
dimple
like
that
of
elisabeth
absorbed
we
almost
forgot
aunt
betty
jennings
stout
radiant
and
curious
elisabeth
chaperon
on
the
whole
i
was
glad
aunt
betty
jennings
was
there
when
a
soldier
approaches
a
point
of
danger
he
does
not
despise
the
cover
of
natural
objects
aunt
betty
appeared
to
me
simply
as
a
natural
object
at
the
time
i
sought
her
shelter
aunt
betty
said
i
as
i
took
her
hand
aunt
betty
have
we
told
you
elisabeth
and
i
i
saw
elisabeth
straighten
in
perplexity
doubt
or
horror
but
i
went
on
yes
elisabeth
and
i
you
children
gurgled
aunt
betty
congratulate
us
both
i
demanded
and
i
put
elisabeth
hand
covered
with
my
own
into
the
short
and
chubby
fingers
of
that
estimable
lady
whenever
elisabeth
attempted
to
open
her
lips
i
opened
mine
before
and
i
so
overwhelmed
dear
aunt
betty
jennings
with
protestations
of
my
regard
for
her
my
interest
in
her
family
her
other
nieces
her
chickens
her
kittens
her
home
i
so
quieted
all
her
questions
by
assertions
and
demands
and
exclamations
and
declarations
that
daniel
churchill
had
given
his
consent
that
i
swear
for
the
moment
even
elisabeth
believed
that
what
i
had
said
was
indeed
true
at
least
i
can
testify
she
made
no
formal
denial
although
the
dimple
was
now
frightened
out
of
sight
admirable
aunt
betty
jennings
she
forestalled
every
assertion
i
made
herself
bubbling
and
blushing
in
sheer
delight
nor
did
she
lack
in
charity
tapping
me
with
her
fan
lightly
she
exclaimed
you
rogue
i
know
that
you
two
want
to
be
alone
that
is
what
you
want
now
i
am
going
away
just
down
the
room
you
will
ride
home
with
us
after
a
time
i
am
sure
adorable
aunt
betty
jennings
elisabeth
and
i
looked
at
her
comfortable
back
for
some
moments
before
i
turned
laughing
to
look
elisabeth
in
the
eyes
you
had
no
right
began
she
her
face
growing
pink
every
right
said
i
and
managed
to
find
a
place
for
our
two
hands
under
cover
of
the
wide
flounces
of
her
figured
lawn
as
we
stood
both
blushing
i
have
every
right
i
have
truly
just
seen
your
father
i
have
just
come
from
him
she
looked
at
me
intently
glowingly
happily
i
could
not
wait
any
longer
i
went
on
within
a
week
i
am
going
to
have
an
office
of
my
own
let
us
wait
no
longer
i
have
waited
long
enough
now
i
babbled
on
and
she
listened
it
was
strange
place
enough
for
a
betrothal
but
there
at
least
i
said
the
words
which
bound
me
and
in
the
look
elisabeth
gave
me
i
saw
her
answer
her
eyes
were
wide
and
straight
and
solemn
she
did
not
smile
as
we
stood
with
small
opportunity
and
perhaps
less
inclination
for
much
conversation
my
eyes
chanced
to
turn
toward
the
main
entrance
door
of
the
east
room
i
saw
pushing
through
a
certain
page
a
young
boy
of
good
family
who
was
employed
by
calhoun
as
messenger
he
knew
me
perfectly
well
as
he
did
almost
every
one
else
in
washington
and
with
precocious
intelligence
his
gaze
picked
me
out
in
all
that
throng
is
that
for
me
i
asked
as
he
extended
his
missive
yes
he
nodded
calhoun
told
me
to
find
you
and
to
give
you
this
at
once
i
turned
to
elisabeth
if
you
will
pardon
me
i
said
she
made
way
for
me
to
pass
to
a
curtained
window
and
there
turning
my
back
and
using
such
secrecy
as
i
could
i
broke
the
seal
the
message
was
brief
to
be
equally
brief
i
may
say
simply
that
it
asked
me
to
be
ready
to
start
for
canada
that
night
on
business
connected
with
the
department
of
state
of
reasons
or
explanations
it
gave
none
i
turned
to
elisabeth
and
held
out
the
message
from
my
chief
she
looked
at
it
her
eyes
widened
nicholas
she
exclaimed
i
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
a
moment
elisabeth
i
said
at
last
i
have
been
gone
on
this
sort
of
business
long
enough
what
do
you
say
to
this
shall
i
decline
to
go
it
means
my
resignation
at
once
i
hesitated
the
heart
of
the
nation
and
the
nation
life
were
about
me
our
state
such
as
it
was
lay
there
in
that
room
and
with
it
our
problems
our
duties
our
dangers
i
knew
better
than
most
that
there
were
real
dangers
before
this
nation
at
that
very
hour
i
was
a
lover
yet
none
the
less
i
was
an
american
at
once
a
sudden
plan
came
into
my
mind
elisabeth
said
i
turning
to
her
swiftly
i
will
agree
to
nothing
which
will
send
me
away
from
you
again
listen
then
i
raised
a
hand
as
she
would
have
spoken
go
home
with
your
aunt
betty
as
soon
as
you
can
tell
your
father
that
at
six
i
shall
be
there
be
ready
what
do
you
mean
she
panted
i
saw
her
throat
flutter
i
mean
that
we
must
be
married
before
i
go
before
eight
i
must
be
on
the
train
when
will
you
be
back
she
whispered
how
can
i
tell
when
i
go
my
wife
shall
wait
there
at
elmhurst
instead
of
my
sweetheart
she
turned
away
from
me
contemplative
she
too
was
young
ardor
appealed
to
her
life
stood
before
her
beckoning
as
to
me
what
could
the
girl
do
or
say
i
placed
her
hand
on
my
arm
we
started
toward
the
door
intending
to
pick
up
aunt
jennings
on
our
way
as
we
advanced
a
group
before
us
broke
apart
i
stood
aside
to
make
way
for
a
gentleman
whom
i
did
not
recognize
on
his
arm
there
leaned
a
woman
a
beautiful
woman
clad
in
a
costume
of
flounced
and
rippling
velvet
of
a
royal
blue
which
made
her
the
most
striking
figure
in
the
great
room
hers
was
a
personality
not
easily
to
be
overlooked
in
any
company
her
face
one
not
readily
to
be
equalled
it
was
the
baroness
helena
von
ritz
we
met
face
to
face
i
presume
it
would
have
been
too
much
to
ask
even
of
her
to
suppress
the
sudden
flash
of
recognition
which
she
showed
at
first
she
did
not
see
that
i
was
accompanied
she
bent
to
me
as
though
to
adjust
her
gown
and
without
a
change
in
the
expression
of
her
face
spoke
to
me
in
an
undertone
no
one
else
could
hear
illustration
wait
she
murmured
there
is
to
be
a
meeting
page
wait
she
murmured
there
is
to
be
a
meeting
she
had
time
for
no
more
as
she
swept
by
alas
that
mere
moments
should
spell
ruin
as
well
as
happiness
this
new
woman
whom
i
had
wooed
and
found
this
new
elisabeth
whose
hand
lay
on
my
arm
saw
what
no
one
else
would
have
seen
that
little
flash
of
recognition
on
the
face
of
helena
von
ritz
she
heard
a
whisper
pass
moreover
with
a
woman
uncanny
facility
in
detail
she
took
in
every
item
of
the
other
costume
for
myself
i
could
see
nothing
of
that
costume
now
save
one
object
a
barbaric
brooch
of
double
shells
and
beaded
fastenings
which
clasped
the
light
laces
at
her
throat
the
baroness
had
perhaps
slept
as
little
as
i
the
night
before
if
i
showed
the
ravages
of
loss
of
sleep
no
more
than
she
i
was
fortunate
she
was
radiant
as
she
passed
forward
with
her
escort
for
place
in
the
line
which
had
not
yet
dwindled
away
you
seem
to
know
that
lady
said
elisabeth
to
me
gently
did
i
so
seem
i
answered
it
is
professional
of
all
to
smile
in
the
east
room
at
a
reception
said
i
then
you
do
not
know
the
lady
indeed
no
why
should
i
my
dear
girl
ah
how
hot
my
face
was
i
do
not
know
said
elisabeth
only
in
a
way
she
resembles
a
certain
lady
of
whom
we
have
heard
rather
more
than
enough
here
in
washington
put
aside
silly
gossip
elisabeth
i
said
and
please
do
not
quarrel
with
me
now
that
i
am
so
happy
nicholas
she
said
leaning
just
a
little
forward
and
locking
her
hands
more
deeply
in
my
arm
do
you
know
you
were
telling
me
one
time
about
the
little
brooch
you
were
going
to
bring
me
an
indian
thing
you
said
it
should
be
my
my
wedding
present
do
you
remember
that
now
i
was
thinking
i
stood
blushing
red
as
though
detected
in
the
utmost
villainy
and
the
girl
at
my
side
saw
that
written
on
my
face
which
now
within
the
very
moment
it
had
become
her
to
question
i
turned
to
her
suddenly
elisabeth
said
i
you
shall
have
your
little
brooch
if
you
will
promise
me
now
to
be
ready
and
waiting
for
me
at
six
i
will
have
the
license
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
new
self
of
elisabeth
warmer
yielding
adorable
was
slowly
going
away
from
me
again
and
that
her
old
self
none
the
less
sweet
none
the
less
alluring
but
more
logical
and
questioning
had
taken
its
old
place
again
she
put
both
her
hands
on
my
arm
now
and
looked
me
fairly
in
the
face
where
the
color
still
proclaimed
some
sort
of
guilt
on
my
part
although
my
heart
was
clean
and
innocent
as
hers
nicholas
she
said
come
bring
me
my
little
jewel
and
bring
the
minister
if
i
do
that
elisabeth
you
will
marry
me
then
yes
she
whispered
softly
amid
all
the
din
and
babble
of
that
motley
throng
i
heard
the
word
low
as
it
was
i
have
never
heard
a
voice
like
elisabeth
an
instant
later
i
knew
not
quite
how
her
hand
was
away
from
my
arm
in
that
of
aunt
betty
and
they
were
passing
toward
the
main
door
leaving
me
standing
with
joy
and
doubt
mingled
in
my
mind
chapter
viii
calhoun
accepts
a
woman
tongue
is
her
sword
that
she
never
lets
rust
i
struggled
among
three
courses
the
impulses
of
my
heart
joined
to
some
prescience
of
trouble
bade
me
to
follow
elisabeth
my
duty
ordered
me
to
hasten
to
calhoun
my
interest
demanded
that
i
should
tarry
for
i
was
sure
that
the
baroness
von
ritz
would
make
no
merely
idle
request
in
these
circumstances
hesitating
thus
i
lost
sight
of
her
in
the
throng
so
i
concluded
i
would
obey
the
mandate
of
duty
and
turned
toward
the
great
doors
indeed
i
was
well
toward
the
steps
which
led
out
into
the
grounds
when
all
at
once
two
elements
of
my
problem
resolved
themselves
into
one
i
saw
the
tall
figure
of
calhoun
himself
coming
up
the
walk
toward
me
ah
said
he
briefly
then
my
message
found
you
i
was
starting
for
you
this
moment
sir
i
replied
wait
for
a
moment
i
counted
on
finding
you
here
matters
have
changed
i
turned
with
him
and
we
entered
again
the
east
room
where
tyler
still
prolonged
the
official
greeting
of
the
curious
the
obsequious
or
the
banal
persons
who
passed
calhoun
stood
apart
for
a
time
watching
the
progress
of
this
purely
american
function
it
was
some
time
ere
the
groups
thinned
this
latter
fact
usually
would
have
ended
the
reception
since
it
is
not
etiquette
to
suppose
that
the
president
can
lack
an
audience
but
tyler
lingered
at
last
through
the
thinning
throng
he
caught
sight
of
the
distinctive
figure
of
calhoun
for
the
first
time
his
own
face
assumed
a
natural
expression
he
stopped
the
line
for
an
instant
and
with
a
raised
hand
beckoned
to
my
chief
at
this
we
dropped
in
at
the
tail
of
the
line
calhoun
in
passing
grasping
almost
as
many
hands
as
tyler
when
at
length
we
reached
the
president
position
the
latter
greeted
him
and
added
a
whispered
word
an
instant
later
he
turned
abruptly
ending
the
reception
with
a
deep
bow
and
retired
into
the
room
from
which
he
had
earlier
emerged
calhoun
turned
now
to
me
with
a
request
to
follow
him
and
we
passed
through
the
door
where
the
president
had
vanished
directed
by
attendants
we
were
presently
ushered
into
yet
another
room
which
at
that
time
served
the
president
as
his
cabinet
room
a
place
for
meeting
persons
of
distinction
who
called
upon
business
as
we
entered
i
saw
that
it
was
already
occupied
tyler
was
grasping
the
hand
of
a
portly
personage
whom
i
knew
to
be
none
other
than
pakenham
so
much
might
have
been
expected
what
was
not
to
have
been
expected
was
the
presence
of
another
none
less
than
the
baroness
von
ritz
for
this
latter
there
was
no
precedent
no
conceivable
explanation
save
some
exigent
emergency
so
we
were
apparently
to
understand
that
my
lady
was
here
as
open
friend
of
england
of
course
i
needed
no
word
from
calhoun
to
remind
me
that
we
must
seem
ignorant
of
this
lady
of
her
character
and
of
her
reputed
relations
with
the
british
foreign
office
i
pray
you
be
seated
pakenham
said
tyler
and
he
gestured
also
to
us
others
to
take
chairs
near
his
table
pakenham
in
rather
a
lofty
fashion
it
seemed
to
me
obeyed
the
polite
request
but
scarcely
had
seated
himself
ere
he
again
rose
with
an
important
clearing
of
his
throat
he
was
one
who
never
relished
the
democratic
title
of
accorded
him
by
tyler
whose
plain
and
simple
ways
not
much
different
now
from
those
of
his
plantation
life
were
in
marked
contrast
to
the
ceremoniousness
of
the
van
buren
administration
which
pakenham
also
had
known
your
said
he
her
majesty
the
queen
of
england
wish
is
somewhat
anticipated
by
my
visit
here
i
hasten
only
to
put
in
the
most
prompt
and
friendly
form
her
majesty
desires
which
i
am
sure
formally
will
be
expressed
in
the
first
mails
from
england
we
deplore
this
most
unhappy
accident
on
your
warship
which
has
come
so
near
working
irremediable
injury
to
this
country
unofficially
i
have
ventured
to
make
this
personal
visit
under
the
flag
of
this
enlightened
republic
and
to
the
center
of
its
official
home
out
of
a
friendship
for
upshur
the
late
secretary
of
state
a
friendship
as
sincere
as
is
that
of
my
own
country
for
this
republic
sir
said
tyler
rising
with
a
deep
bow
the
courtesy
of
your
personal
presence
is
most
gratifying
allow
me
to
express
that
more
intimate
and
warmer
feeling
of
friendship
for
yourself
which
comes
through
our
long
association
with
you
this
respect
and
admiration
are
felt
by
myself
and
my
official
family
for
you
and
the
great
power
which
you
represent
it
goes
to
you
with
a
special
sincerity
as
to
a
gentleman
of
learning
and
distinction
whose
lofty
motives
and
ideals
are
recognized
by
all
each
having
thus
delivered
himself
of
words
which
meant
nothing
both
now
seated
themselves
and
proceeded
to
look
mighty
grave
for
myself
i
stole
a
glance
from
the
tail
of
my
eye
toward
the
baroness
von
ritz
she
sat
erect
in
her
chair
a
figure
of
easy
grace
and
dignity
but
on
her
face
was
nothing
one
could
read
to
tell
who
she
was
or
why
she
was
here
so
far
from
any
external
she
seemed
quite
as
much
at
home
here
and
quite
as
fit
here
as
england
plenipotentiary
i
seize
upon
this
opportunity
pakenham
said
tyler
presently
with
a
smile
which
he
meant
to
set
all
at
ease
and
to
soften
as
much
as
possible
the
severity
of
that
which
was
to
follow
i
gladly
take
this
opportunity
to
mention
in
an
informal
way
my
hope
that
this
matter
which
was
already
inaugurated
by
upshur
before
his
untimely
death
may
come
to
perfectly
pleasant
consummation
i
refer
to
the
question
of
texas
i
beg
pardon
your
excellency
rejoined
pakenham
half
rising
your
meaning
is
not
perfectly
clear
to
me
the
same
icy
smile
sat
upon
tyler
face
as
he
went
on
i
can
not
believe
that
your
government
can
wish
to
interfere
in
matters
upon
this
continent
to
the
extent
of
taking
the
position
of
open
ally
of
the
republic
of
mexico
a
power
so
recently
at
war
upon
our
own
borders
with
the
brave
texans
who
have
left
our
flag
to
set
up
through
fair
conquest
a
republic
of
their
own
the
mottled
face
of
pakenham
assumed
a
yet
deeper
red
as
to
that
your
excellency
said
he
your
remark
is
as
you
say
quite
informal
of
course
that
is
to
say
as
i
may
state
quite
so
rejoined
tyler
gravely
the
note
of
my
lord
aberdeen
to
us
none
the
less
in
the
point
of
its
bearing
upon
the
question
of
slavery
in
texas
appears
to
this
government
as
an
expression
which
ought
to
be
disavowed
by
your
own
government
do
i
make
myself
quite
clear
with
john
calhoun
present
tyler
could
at
times
assume
a
courage
though
he
had
it
not
pakenham
face
glowed
a
deeper
red
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
discuss
my
lord
aberdeen
wishes
in
this
matter
he
said
we
met
here
upon
a
purely
informal
matter
and
i
have
only
ventured
to
hope
rejoined
tyler
that
the
personal
kindness
of
your
own
heart
might
move
you
in
so
grave
a
matter
as
that
which
may
lead
to
war
between
two
powers
war
sir
pakenham
went
wholly
purple
in
his
surprise
and
sprang
to
his
feet
war
he
repeated
once
more
as
though
there
could
be
any
hope
quite
right
sir
said
tyler
grimly
as
though
there
could
be
any
hope
for
us
save
in
our
own
conduct
of
our
own
affairs
without
any
interference
from
any
foreign
power
i
knew
it
was
john
calhoun
speaking
these
words
not
tyler
i
saw
calhoun
keen
cold
eyes
fixed
closely
upon
the
face
of
his
president
the
consternation
created
by
the
latter
words
was
plainly
visible
of
course
this
conversation
is
entirely
irregular
i
mean
to
say
wholly
unofficial
your
excellency
hesitated
pakenham
it
takes
no
part
in
our
records
assuredly
not
said
tyler
i
only
hope
the
question
may
never
come
to
a
matter
of
record
at
all
once
our
country
knows
that
dictation
has
been
attempted
with
us
even
by
england
herself
the
north
will
join
the
south
in
resentment
even
now
in
restiveness
at
the
fancied
attitude
of
england
toward
mexico
the
west
raises
the
demand
that
we
shall
end
the
joint
occupancy
of
oregon
with
great
britain
do
you
perchance
know
the
watchword
which
is
now
on
the
popular
tongue
west
of
the
alleghanies
it
bids
fair
to
become
an
american
i
must
confess
my
ignorance
rejoined
pakenham
our
backwoodsmen
have
invented
a
phrase
which
runs
forty
or
i
beg
pardon
i
am
sure
your
excellency
it
means
that
if
we
conclude
to
terminate
the
very
unsatisfactory
muddle
along
the
columbia
river
a
stream
which
our
mariners
first
explored
as
we
contend
and
if
we
conclude
to
dispute
with
england
as
well
regarding
our
delimitations
on
the
southwest
where
she
has
even
less
right
to
speak
then
we
shall
contend
for
that
territory
not
only
up
to
the
columbia
but
north
to
the
russian
line
the
parallel
of
degrees
and
forty
minutes
we
claim
that
we
once
bought
texas
clear
to
the
rio
grande
from
napoleon
although
the
foolish
treaty
with
spain
in
clouded
our
title
in
the
belief
of
our
whig
friends
who
do
not
desire
more
slave
territory
even
the
whigs
think
that
we
own
oregon
by
virtue
of
first
navigation
of
the
columbia
both
whigs
and
democrats
now
demand
oregon
north
to
degrees
forty
minutes
the
alternative
my
lord
aberdeen
surely
makes
no
deliberate
bid
to
hear
it
or
fight
exclaimed
pakenham
god
bless
my
soul
fight
tyler
flushed
such
things
have
been
said
he
with
dignity
that
is
to
say
he
resumed
calmly
our
rude
westerners
are
egotistic
and
ignorant
i
admit
that
we
are
young
but
believe
me
when
the
american
people
say
it
has
but
one
meaning
as
their
servant
i
am
obliged
to
convey
that
meaning
in
this
democracy
the
will
of
the
people
rules
in
war
we
have
no
whigs
no
democrats
we
have
only
at
this
astounding
speech
the
british
minister
sat
dumfounded
this
air
of
courage
and
confidence
on
the
part
of
tyler
himself
was
something
foreign
to
his
record
i
knew
the
reason
for
his
boldness
john
calhoun
sat
at
his
right
hand
at
least
the
meaning
of
this
sudden
assault
was
too
much
for
representative
perhaps
indeed
the
berserker
blood
of
our
frontier
spoke
in
tyler
gaze
that
we
would
fight
indeed
was
true
enough
it
only
occurs
to
us
sir
continued
the
president
that
the
great
altruism
of
england
heart
has
led
her
for
a
moment
to
utter
sentiments
in
a
form
which
might
perhaps
not
be
sanctioned
in
her
colder
judgment
this
nation
has
not
asked
counsel
we
are
not
yet
agreed
in
our
congress
upon
the
admission
of
texas
although
i
may
say
to
you
sir
with
fairness
that
such
is
the
purpose
of
this
administration
there
being
no
war
we
still
have
whigs
and
democrats
at
this
point
your
excellency
the
dignity
of
her
majesty
service
would
lead
me
to
ask
excuse
rejoined
pakenham
formally
were
it
not
for
one
fact
which
i
should
like
to
offer
here
i
have
in
short
news
which
will
appear
full
warrant
for
any
communication
thus
far
made
by
her
majesty
government
i
can
assure
you
that
there
has
come
into
the
possession
of
this
lady
whose
able
services
i
venture
to
enlist
here
in
her
presence
a
communication
from
the
republic
of
texas
to
the
government
of
england
that
communication
is
done
by
no
less
a
hand
than
that
of
the
attaché
for
the
republic
of
texas
van
zandt
himself
there
was
i
think
no
other
formal
invitation
for
the
baroness
von
ritz
to
speak
but
now
she
arose
swept
a
curtsey
first
to
tyler
and
then
to
pakenham
and
calhoun
it
is
not
to
be
expected
your
excellency
and
gentlemen
said
she
that
i
can
add
anything
of
value
here
her
eyes
were
demurely
downcast
we
do
not
doubt
your
familiarity
with
many
of
these
late
events
encouraged
tyler
true
she
continued
the
note
of
my
lord
aberdeen
is
the
property
of
the
streets
and
of
this
i
have
some
knowledge
i
can
see
also
difficulty
in
its
reception
among
the
courageous
gentlemen
of
america
but
as
to
any
written
communication
from
van
zandt
there
must
be
some
mistake
i
was
of
the
impression
that
you
would
have
had
it
last
night
rejoined
pakenham
plainly
confused
in
fact
that
gentleman
advised
me
to
such
effect
the
baroness
helena
von
ritz
looked
him
full
in
the
face
and
only
gravely
shook
her
head
i
regret
matters
should
be
so
much
at
fault
said
she
then
let
me
explain
resumed
pakenham
almost
angrily
i
will
state
unofficially
of
course
that
the
promises
of
van
zandt
were
that
her
majesty
might
expect
an
early
end
of
the
talk
of
the
annexation
of
texas
to
the
united
states
the
greater
power
of
england
upon
land
or
sea
would
assure
that
weak
republic
of
a
great
and
enlightened
ally
in
his
belief
an
ally
broke
out
calhoun
and
a
document
sent
to
that
effect
by
the
attaché
of
texas
he
smiled
coldly
two
things
seem
very
apparent
president
first
that
this
gentle
lady
stands
high
in
the
respect
of
england
ministry
second
that
van
zandt
if
all
this
were
true
ought
to
stand
very
low
in
ours
i
would
say
all
this
and
much
more
even
were
it
a
state
utterance
to
stand
upon
the
records
of
this
nation
sir
interrupted
tyler
swiftly
turning
to
calhoun
i
not
ask
you
that
it
be
left
as
a
state
utterance
calhoun
bowed
with
the
grace
habitual
to
him
his
hand
upon
his
heart
but
he
made
no
answer
the
real
reason
might
have
been
read
in
the
mottled
face
of
pakenham
now
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
as
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
calhoun
continued
the
president
you
know
that
the
office
of
our
secretary
of
state
is
vacant
there
is
no
one
living
would
serve
in
that
office
more
wisely
than
yourself
no
one
more
in
accordance
with
my
own
views
as
to
these
very
questions
which
are
before
us
since
it
has
come
to
that
point
i
offer
you
now
that
office
and
do
so
officially
i
ask
your
answer
the
face
of
england
minister
now
for
the
first
time
went
colorless
he
knew
what
this
meant
as
for
john
calhoun
he
played
with
both
of
them
as
a
cat
would
with
a
mouse
sneeringly
superior
his
answer
was
couched
in
terms
suited
to
his
own
purposes
this
dignity
president
said
he
bowing
deeply
again
so
unexpected
so
onerous
so
responsible
is
one
which
at
least
needs
time
for
proper
consideration
i
must
crave
opportunity
for
reflection
and
for
pondering
in
my
surprise
at
your
sudden
request
i
find
no
proper
answer
ready
here
then
seemed
an
opportunity
for
delay
which
pakenham
was
swift
to
grasp
he
arose
and
bowed
to
tyler
i
am
sure
that
calhoun
will
require
some
days
at
least
for
the
framing
of
his
answer
to
an
invitation
so
grave
as
this
i
shall
require
at
least
some
moments
said
calhoun
smiling
that
of
president
says
forty
or
that
means
rio
grande
or
fight
as
well
a
short
silence
fell
upon
us
all
tyler
half
rose
and
half
frowned
as
he
noticed
pakenham
shuffling
as
though
he
would
depart
it
shall
be
of
course
as
you
suggest
said
the
president
to
pakenham
there
is
no
record
of
any
of
this
but
the
answer
of
calhoun
which
i
await
and
now
demand
is
one
which
will
go
upon
the
records
of
this
country
soon
enough
i
fancy
i
ask
you
then
to
hear
what
calhoun
replies
ah
it
was
well
arranged
and
handsomely
staged
this
little
comedy
and
done
for
the
benefit
of
england
after
all
i
almost
might
have
believed
that
calhoun
had
rehearsed
this
with
the
president
certainly
the
latter
knew
perfectly
well
what
his
answer
was
to
be
calhoun
himself
made
that
deliberately
plain
when
presently
he
arose
i
have
had
some
certain
moments
for
reflection
president
said
he
and
i
have
from
the
first
moment
of
this
surprising
offer
on
your
part
been
humbly
sensible
of
the
honor
offered
so
old
and
so
unfit
a
man
sir
my
own
record
thank
god
is
clear
i
have
stood
for
the
south
i
stand
now
for
texas
i
believe
in
her
and
her
future
she
belongs
to
us
as
i
have
steadfastly
insisted
at
all
hours
and
in
all
places
she
will
widen
the
southern
vote
in
congress
that
is
true
she
will
be
for
slavery
that
also
is
true
i
myself
have
stood
for
slavery
but
i
am
yet
more
devoted
to
democracy
and
to
america
than
i
am
to
the
south
and
to
slavery
so
will
texas
be
i
know
what
texas
means
she
means
for
us
also
oregon
she
means
more
than
that
she
means
also
a
democracy
spreading
across
this
entire
continent
my
attitude
in
that
regard
has
been
always
clear
i
have
not
sought
to
change
it
sir
if
i
take
this
office
which
you
offer
i
do
so
with
the
avowed
and
expressed
purpose
of
bringing
texas
into
this
union
in
full
view
of
any
and
all
consequences
i
shall
offer
her
a
treaty
of
annexation
once
i
shall
urge
annexation
at
every
hour
in
every
place
in
all
ways
within
my
means
and
in
full
view
of
the
consequences
he
looked
now
gravely
and
keenly
at
the
english
plenipotentiary
that
is
well
understood
calhoun
began
tyler
your
views
are
in
full
accord
with
my
own
pakenham
looked
from
the
one
to
the
other
from
the
thin
vulpine
face
to
the
thin
leonine
one
the
pity
tyler
felt
for
the
old
visible
weakness
showed
on
his
face
as
he
spoke
what
then
is
the
answer
of
john
calhoun
to
this
latest
call
of
his
country
that
answer
is
one
which
is
in
our
history
john
calhoun
accepts
said
my
master
loud
and
clear
chapter
ix
a
kettle
of
fish
few
disputes
exist
which
have
not
had
their
origin
in
women
i
saw
the
heavy
face
of
pakenham
go
pale
saw
the
face
of
the
baroness
von
ritz
flash
with
a
swift
resolution
saw
the
eyes
of
calhoun
and
tyler
meet
in
firmness
an
instant
later
tyler
rose
and
bowed
our
dismissal
our
little
play
was
done
which
of
us
knew
all
the
motives
that
had
lain
behind
its
setting
pakenham
drew
apart
and
engaged
in
earnest
speech
with
the
lady
who
had
accompanied
him
so
that
meantime
i
myself
found
opportunity
for
a
word
with
calhoun
now
said
i
the
fat
certainly
is
all
in
the
fire
what
fat
my
son
asked
calhoun
serenely
and
what
fire
at
least
and
i
grinned
covertly
i
fear
it
seems
all
over
between
my
lady
and
her
protector
there
she
turned
traitor
just
when
he
had
most
need
of
her
tell
me
what
argument
did
you
use
with
her
last
night
calhoun
took
snuff
you
do
know
women
my
son
and
you
do
know
men
either
the
thin
white
skin
about
his
eyes
wrinkled
certainly
i
do
know
what
arts
may
have
been
employed
in
calhoun
office
at
two
this
morning
i
smiled
frankly
now
at
my
chief
and
he
relaxed
in
turn
we
had
a
most
pleasant
visit
of
an
hour
a
delightful
woman
a
charming
woman
and
one
of
intellect
as
well
i
appealed
to
her
heart
her
brain
her
purse
and
she
laughed
for
the
most
part
yet
she
argued
too
and
seemed
to
have
some
interest
as
you
see
proved
now
ah
i
wish
i
could
have
had
the
other
two
great
motives
to
add
to
my
appeal
meaning
love
and
curiosity
with
those
added
i
could
have
won
her
over
for
believe
me
she
is
none
too
firmly
anchored
to
england
i
am
sure
of
that
though
it
leaves
me
still
puzzled
if
you
think
her
personal
hold
on
yonder
gentleman
will
be
lessened
you
err
he
added
in
a
low
voice
i
consider
it
sure
that
he
is
bent
on
her
as
much
as
he
is
on
england
see
she
has
him
back
in
hand
already
i
would
she
were
friend
is
she
not
i
asked
suddenly
we
two
may
answer
that
one
day
said
calhoun
enigmatically
now
i
offered
to
calhoun
the
note
i
had
received
from
his
page
this
journey
i
began
can
i
not
be
excused
from
making
that
there
is
a
very
special
reason
what
can
it
be
asked
calhoun
frowning
i
am
to
be
married
sir
said
i
calmly
as
i
could
it
was
calhoun
turn
now
to
be
surprised
zounds
boy
what
do
you
mean
there
is
no
time
to
waste
i
do
not
hold
it
quite
wasted
sir
said
i
with
dignity
miss
elisabeth
churchill
and
i
for
a
long
time
miss
elisabeth
so
the
wind
is
there
eh
my
daughter
friend
i
know
her
very
well
of
course
very
well
done
indeed
for
you
but
there
can
be
no
wedding
i
looked
at
him
in
amazement
he
was
as
absorbed
as
though
he
felt
empowered
to
settle
that
matter
for
me
a
moment
later
seeing
pakenham
taking
his
leave
he
stepped
to
the
side
of
the
baroness
i
saw
him
and
that
mysterious
lady
fall
into
a
conversation
as
grave
as
that
which
had
but
now
been
ended
i
guessed
rather
than
reasoned
that
in
some
mysterious
way
i
came
into
their
talk
but
presently
both
approached
me
trist
said
calhoun
i
beg
you
to
hand
the
baroness
von
ritz
to
her
carriage
which
will
wait
at
the
avenue
we
were
then
standing
near
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
steps
i
see
my
friend
polk
approaching
he
continued
and
i
would
like
to
have
a
word
or
so
with
him
we
three
walked
in
company
down
the
steps
and
a
short
distance
along
the
walk
until
presently
we
faced
the
gentleman
whose
approach
had
been
noted
we
paused
in
a
little
group
under
the
shade
of
an
avenue
tree
and
the
gentlemen
removed
their
hats
as
calhoun
made
a
somewhat
formal
introduction
at
that
time
of
course
james
polk
of
tennessee
was
not
the
national
figure
he
was
soon
to
become
at
the
baltimore
convention
he
was
known
best
as
speaker
of
the
house
for
some
time
and
as
a
man
experienced
in
western
politics
a
friend
of
jackson
who
still
controlled
a
large
wing
of
the
disaffected
the
democratic
party
then
being
scarce
more
than
a
league
of
warring
cliques
although
once
governor
of
tennessee
it
still
was
an
honor
for
polk
to
be
sought
out
by
senator
john
calhoun
sometime
sometime
cabinet
member
in
different
capacities
he
showed
this
as
he
uncovered
a
rather
short
man
and
thin
enough
and
of
extremely
serious
mien
he
scarce
could
have
been
as
wise
as
he
looked
any
more
than
daniel
webster
yet
he
was
good
example
of
conventional
politics
platitudes
and
all
they
have
adjourned
at
the
house
then
said
calhoun
yes
and
adjourned
a
bear
pit
at
that
answered
the
gentleman
from
tennessee
tyler
has
asked
me
to
come
across
town
to
meet
him
do
you
happen
to
know
where
he
is
now
he
was
here
a
few
moments
ago
governor
we
were
but
escorting
this
lady
to
her
carriage
as
she
claims
fatigue
from
late
hours
at
the
ball
last
night
surely
so
radiant
a
presence
said
polk
gallantly
means
that
she
left
the
ball
at
an
early
hour
quite
so
replied
that
somewhat
uncertain
lady
demurely
early
hours
and
a
good
conscience
are
advised
by
my
physicians
my
dear
lady
time
owns
his
own
defeat
in
you
polk
assured
her
his
eyes
sufficiently
admiring
such
pretty
speeches
as
these
gentlemen
of
america
make
was
her
gay
reply
is
it
not
so
mr
secretary
she
smiled
up
at
calhoun
serious
face
polk
was
possessed
of
a
political
nose
which
rarely
failed
him
secretary
he
exclaimed
turning
to
calhoun
the
latter
bowed
i
have
just
accepted
the
place
lately
filled
by
upshur
was
his
comment
a
slow
color
rose
in
the
tennesseean
face
as
he
held
out
his
hand
i
congratulate
you
secretary
said
he
now
at
last
we
shall
see
an
end
of
indecision
and
boasting
pretense
excellent
things
to
end
governor
polk
said
calhoun
gravely
i
am
but
an
humble
adviser
rejoined
the
man
from
tennessee
but
assuredly
i
must
hasten
to
congratulate
tyler
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
means
texas
of
course
my
dear
madam
we
talk
riddles
in
your
presence
quite
riddles
although
i
remain
interested
she
answered
i
saw
her
cool
eyes
take
in
his
figure
measuring
him
calmly
for
her
mental
tablets
as
i
could
believe
was
her
wont
but
i
find
myself
indeed
somewhat
fatigued
she
continued
and
since
these
are
matters
of
which
i
am
ignorant
of
course
madam
said
calhoun
we
crave
your
pardon
trist
so
now
i
took
the
lady
sunshade
from
her
hand
and
we
two
making
adieux
passed
down
the
shaded
walk
toward
the
avenue
you
are
a
good
cavalier
she
said
to
me
i
find
you
not
so
fat
as
pakenham
nor
so
thin
as
calhoun
my
faith
could
you
have
seen
that
gentleman
this
morning
in
a
wrapper
and
in
a
red
worsted
nightcap
but
what
did
you
determine
i
asked
her
suddenly
what
has
my
chief
said
to
cause
you
to
fail
poor
pakenham
as
you
did
i
pitied
the
poor
man
in
such
a
grueling
and
wholly
without
warning
monsieur
is
droll
she
replied
evasively
as
though
i
had
changed
i
will
say
this
much
i
think
sir
richard
will
care
more
for
mexico
and
less
for
mexicans
after
this
but
you
do
not
tell
me
when
you
are
coming
to
see
me
to
bring
back
my
little
shoe
its
mate
has
arrived
by
special
messenger
but
the
pair
remains
still
broken
do
you
come
this
afternoon
i
wish
that
i
might
said
i
why
be
churlish
with
me
she
demanded
did
i
not
call
at
your
request
upon
a
gentleman
in
a
red
nightcap
at
two
in
the
morning
and
for
your
sake
and
the
sake
of
sport
did
i
not
almost
promise
him
many
things
come
now
am
i
not
to
see
you
and
explain
all
that
and
hear
you
explain
all
this
she
made
a
little
at
me
it
would
be
my
delight
madam
but
there
are
two
reasons
one
then
i
am
going
to
montreal
for
one
she
gave
me
a
swift
glance
which
i
could
not
understand
so
she
said
why
so
soon
orders
said
i
briefly
but
perhaps
i
may
not
obey
orders
for
once
there
is
another
reason
and
that
one
i
am
to
be
married
at
six
i
turned
to
enjoy
her
consternation
indeed
there
was
an
alternate
white
and
red
passed
across
her
face
but
at
once
she
was
in
hand
and
you
allowed
me
to
become
your
devoted
slave
she
said
even
to
the
extent
of
calling
upon
a
man
in
a
red
nightcap
and
then
even
upon
a
morning
like
this
when
the
birds
sing
so
sweetly
and
the
little
flowers
show
pink
and
white
now
you
cast
down
my
most
sacred
feelings
the
mockery
in
her
tone
was
perfect
i
scarce
had
paused
to
note
it
i
was
absorbed
in
one
thought
of
elisabeth
where
one
fire
burns
high
and
clear
upon
the
altar
of
the
heart
there
is
small
room
for
any
other
i
might
have
told
you
said
i
at
last
but
i
did
not
myself
know
it
until
this
morning
my
faith
this
country
she
exclaimed
with
genuine
surprise
what
extraordinary
things
it
does
i
have
just
seen
history
made
between
the
lightings
of
a
cigarette
as
it
were
now
comes
this
man
and
announces
that
since
midnight
he
has
met
and
won
the
lady
who
is
to
rule
his
heart
and
that
he
is
to
marry
her
at
six
then
congratulate
me
i
demanded
ah
she
said
suddenly
absorbed
it
was
that
tall
girl
yes
yes
i
see
i
see
i
understand
so
then
yes
but
still
you
have
not
congratulated
me
ah
monsieur
she
answered
lightly
one
woman
never
congratulates
a
man
when
he
has
won
another
what
of
my
own
heart
fie
fie
yet
she
had
curious
color
in
her
face
i
do
not
credit
myself
with
such
fatal
charms
said
i
rather
say
what
of
my
little
clasp
there
i
promised
that
to
the
tall
girl
as
you
know
and
might
i
not
wear
it
for
an
hour
i
shall
give
you
a
dozen
better
some
time
said
i
but
and
my
slipper
i
said
i
must
have
that
back
because
i
can
not
hop
along
with
but
one
shoe
all
my
life
that
you
shall
have
as
soon
as
i
can
get
to
my
rooms
at
brown
hotel
yonder
a
messenger
shall
bring
it
to
you
at
once
time
will
indeed
be
short
for
me
first
the
slipper
for
madam
then
the
license
for
myself
then
the
minister
then
a
friend
then
a
carriage
five
miles
to
elmhurst
and
the
train
for
the
north
starts
at
eight
indeed
as
you
say
the
methods
of
this
country
are
sometimes
hurried
madam
can
not
you
use
your
wits
in
a
cause
so
worthy
as
mine
i
could
not
at
the
time
understand
the
swift
change
of
her
features
one
woman
wits
against
another
she
flashed
at
me
as
for
that
she
made
a
swift
motion
to
her
throat
here
is
the
trinket
tell
the
tall
lady
it
is
my
present
to
you
tell
her
i
may
send
her
a
wedding
present
when
the
wedding
really
is
to
happen
of
course
you
do
not
mean
what
you
have
said
about
being
married
in
such
haste
every
word
of
it
i
answered
and
at
her
own
home
is
no
runaway
match
i
have
the
consent
of
her
father
but
you
said
you
had
her
consent
only
an
hour
ago
ah
this
is
better
than
a
play
it
is
true
said
i
there
has
not
been
time
to
inform
miss
churchill
family
of
my
need
for
haste
i
shall
attend
to
that
when
i
arrive
the
lady
has
seen
the
note
from
calhoun
ordering
me
to
montreal
to
montreal
how
curious
she
mused
but
what
did
calhoun
say
to
this
marriage
he
forbade
the
banns
but
monsieur
will
take
her
before
him
in
a
sack
and
he
will
forbid
you
i
am
sure
to
condemn
that
lady
to
a
life
in
a
cabin
to
a
couch
of
husks
to
a
lord
who
would
crush
her
arms
and
command
her
i
flushed
as
she
reminded
me
of
my
own
speech
and
there
came
no
answer
but
the
one
which
i
imagine
is
the
verdict
of
all
lovers
she
is
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
i
declared
has
she
fortune
i
do
not
know
have
you
fortune
god
knows
no
you
have
but
this
country
that
is
all
it
is
enough
said
she
sighing
dear
god
it
is
enough
but
then
turned
to
me
suddenly
i
do
think
you
will
be
married
so
soon
after
all
wait
that
is
what
pakenham
wanted
calhoun
to
do
i
smiled
but
pakenham
is
not
a
woman
ah
then
you
also
forbid
our
banns
if
you
challenge
me
she
retorted
i
shall
do
my
worst
then
do
your
worst
i
said
all
of
you
do
your
joint
worst
you
can
not
shake
the
faith
of
elisabeth
churchill
in
me
nor
mine
in
her
oh
yes
by
all
means
do
your
worst
very
well
she
said
with
a
catch
of
her
breath
at
least
we
both
said
guard
i
wish
i
could
ask
you
to
attend
at
our
wedding
i
concluded
as
her
carriage
approached
the
curb
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
not
even
friends
of
the
family
will
be
present
and
of
those
not
all
the
family
will
be
friends
she
did
not
seem
to
see
her
carriage
as
it
paused
although
she
prepared
to
enter
when
i
opened
the
door
her
look
absorbed
general
seemed
rather
to
take
in
the
sweep
of
the
wide
grounds
the
green
of
the
young
springtime
the
bursting
of
the
new
white
blossoms
the
blue
of
the
sky
the
loom
of
the
distant
capitol
dome
all
the
crude
promise
of
our
young
and
tawdry
capital
still
in
the
making
of
a
world
city
her
eyes
passed
to
me
and
searched
my
face
without
looking
into
my
eyes
as
though
i
made
part
of
her
study
what
sat
on
her
face
was
perplexity
wonder
amazement
and
something
else
i
know
not
what
something
of
her
perfect
poise
and
confidence
her
quality
as
woman
of
the
world
seemed
to
drop
away
a
strange
and
childlike
quality
came
into
her
face
a
pathos
unlike
anything
i
had
seen
there
before
she
took
my
hand
mechanically
of
course
said
she
as
though
she
spoke
to
herself
it
can
not
be
but
dear
god
would
it
not
be
enough
i
did
not
understand
her
speech
i
stood
and
watched
her
carriage
as
it
whirled
away
thinking
of
my
great
need
for
haste
mechanically
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
one
then
i
reflected
that
it
was
at
eleven
of
the
night
previous
that
i
had
first
met
the
baroness
von
ritz
our
acquaintance
had
therefore
lasted
some
fourteen
hours
chapter
x
mixed
duties
most
women
will
forgive
a
liberty
rather
than
a
slight
when
i
crossed
the
white
house
grounds
and
found
my
way
to
the
spot
where
i
had
left
my
horse
i
discovered
my
darky
boy
lying
on
his
back
fast
asleep
under
a
tree
the
bridle
reins
hooked
over
his
upturned
foot
i
wakened
him
took
the
reins
and
was
about
to
mount
when
at
the
moment
i
heard
my
name
called
turning
i
saw
emerge
from
the
door
of
gautier
little
café
across
the
street
the
tall
figure
of
an
erstwhile
friend
of
mine
jack
dandridge
of
tennessee
credited
with
being
the
youngest
member
in
the
house
of
representatives
at
washington
and
credited
with
little
else
dandridge
had
been
taken
up
by
friends
of
jackson
and
polk
and
carried
into
congress
without
much
plan
or
objection
on
either
side
since
his
arrival
at
the
capital
he
had
been
present
at
few
and
had
voted
on
fewer
measures
his
life
was
given
up
in
the
main
to
one
specialty
the
compounding
of
a
certain
beverage
invented
by
himself
the
constituent
parts
of
which
were
bourbon
whiskey
absinthe
square
faced
gin
and
a
dash
of
de
this
concoction
over
which
few
shared
his
own
personal
enthusiasm
he
had
christened
the
dream
although
dandridge
himself
was
opposed
to
the
tenets
of
the
political
party
thus
entitled
which
by
the
way
was
to
get
its
whimsical
name
possibly
from
dandridge
himself
at
the
forthcoming
democratic
convention
of
that
year
jack
dandridge
it
may
be
said
was
originally
possessed
of
a
splendid
constitution
nearly
six
feet
tall
his
full
and
somewhat
protruding
eye
was
as
yet
only
a
trifle
watery
his
wide
lip
only
a
trifle
loose
his
strong
figure
only
a
trifle
portly
socially
he
had
been
well
received
in
our
city
and
during
his
stay
east
of
the
mountains
he
had
found
occasion
to
lay
desperate
suit
to
the
hand
of
none
other
than
miss
elisabeth
churchill
we
had
been
rivals
although
not
enemies
for
jack
finding
which
way
the
wind
sat
for
him
withdrew
like
a
man
and
cherished
no
ill
will
when
i
saw
him
now
a
sudden
idea
came
to
me
so
that
i
crossed
the
street
at
his
invitation
come
in
said
he
come
in
with
me
and
have
a
dream
i
have
just
invented
a
new
touch
for
it
i
have
my
word
jack
i
exclaimed
grasping
him
by
the
shoulder
you
are
the
man
i
want
you
are
the
friend
that
i
need
the
very
one
certainly
certainly
he
said
but
please
do
not
disarrange
my
cravat
sir
i
move
you
the
previous
question
will
you
have
a
dream
with
me
i
construct
them
now
with
three
additional
squirts
of
the
absinthe
he
locked
his
arm
in
mine
you
may
have
a
dream
said
i
but
for
me
i
need
all
my
head
in
short
i
need
both
our
heads
as
well
jack
was
already
rapping
with
the
head
of
his
cane
upon
the
table
to
call
an
attendant
but
he
turned
to
me
what
is
the
matter
lady
this
time
two
of
them
indeed
one
apiece
eh
none
apiece
perhaps
in
any
case
you
lose
then
the
names
or
at
least
one
i
flushed
a
bit
in
spite
of
myself
you
know
miss
elisabeth
churchill
he
nodded
gravely
and
about
the
other
lady
i
can
not
tell
you
much
about
her
said
i
i
have
but
little
knowledge
myself
i
mean
the
baroness
von
ritz
oh
ho
jack
opened
his
eyes
and
gave
a
long
whistle
state
secrets
eh
i
nodded
and
looked
him
square
in
the
eye
well
why
should
you
ask
me
to
help
you
then
calhoun
is
none
too
good
a
friend
of
polk
of
my
state
calhoun
is
neither
whig
nor
democrat
he
does
not
know
where
he
stands
if
you
train
with
him
why
come
to
our
camp
for
help
not
that
sort
jack
i
answered
the
favor
i
ask
is
personal
explain
he
sipped
at
the
fiery
drink
which
by
this
time
had
been
placed
before
him
his
face
brightening
i
must
be
quick
i
have
in
my
possession
on
the
bureau
in
my
little
room
at
my
quarters
in
brown
hotel
a
slipper
which
the
baroness
gave
me
last
night
a
white
satin
slipper
jack
finished
the
remainder
of
his
glass
at
a
gulp
good
god
he
remarked
quite
right
i
retorted
hotly
accuse
me
anything
you
like
but
go
to
my
headquarters
get
that
slipper
go
to
this
address
with
it
i
scrawled
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
thrust
it
at
him
then
get
a
carriage
and
hasten
to
elmhurst
drive
where
it
turns
in
at
the
road
wait
for
me
there
just
before
six
he
sat
looking
at
me
with
amusement
and
amazement
both
upon
his
face
as
i
went
on
listen
to
what
i
am
to
do
in
the
meantime
first
i
go
post
haste
to
calhoun
office
then
i
am
to
take
his
message
which
will
send
me
to
canada
after
i
have
my
orders
i
hurry
back
to
brown
and
dress
for
my
wedding
the
glass
in
his
hand
dropped
to
the
floor
in
splinters
your
wedding
yes
miss
elisabeth
and
i
concluded
this
very
morning
not
to
wait
i
would
ask
you
to
help
me
as
my
best
man
if
i
dare
you
do
dare
said
he
you
all
go
on
i
get
a
parson
how
doctor
halford
do
and
i
take
care
of
the
license
for
you
if
i
could
gad
sorry
it
not
my
own
you
are
the
finest
fellow
in
the
world
jack
i
have
only
one
thing
more
to
ask
i
pointed
to
the
splintered
glass
upon
the
floor
get
another
of
course
not
of
course
not
he
expostulated
his
voice
was
just
a
trifle
thickened
we
left
now
together
for
the
license
clerk
and
i
intrusted
the
proper
document
in
my
friend
hands
an
instant
later
i
was
outside
mounted
and
off
for
calhoun
office
at
his
residence
in
georgetown
at
last
as
for
the
fourth
time
i
flung
down
the
narrow
walk
and
looked
down
the
street
i
saw
his
form
approaching
he
walked
slowly
somewhat
stooped
upon
his
cane
he
raised
a
hand
as
i
would
have
begun
to
speak
his
customary
reserve
and
dignity
held
me
back
so
you
made
it
out
well
with
the
lady
he
began
yes
i
answered
flushing
not
so
badly
for
the
time
that
offered
a
remarkable
woman
he
said
most
remarkable
then
he
went
on
now
as
to
your
own
intended
i
congratulate
you
but
i
suggest
that
you
keep
miss
elisabeth
churchill
and
the
baroness
von
ritz
pretty
well
separated
if
that
be
possible
sir
i
stammered
that
certainly
is
my
personal
intent
but
now
may
i
ask
you
start
to
canada
said
calhoun
sharply
all
softness
gone
from
his
voice
i
can
not
well
do
that
i
began
his
hand
tapped
with
decision
i
have
no
time
to
choose
another
messenger
he
said
time
will
not
wait
you
must
not
fail
me
you
will
take
the
railway
train
at
eight
you
will
be
joined
by
doctor
samuel
ward
who
will
give
you
a
sealed
paper
which
will
contain
your
instructions
and
the
proper
moneys
he
goes
as
far
as
baltimore
you
would
be
the
better
agent
he
added
presently
if
this
love
silliness
were
out
of
your
head
it
is
not
myself
you
are
serving
and
not
my
party
it
is
this
country
you
are
serving
but
sir
i
began
his
long
thin
hand
was
imperative
go
on
then
with
your
wedding
if
you
will
and
if
you
can
but
see
that
you
do
not
miss
the
train
at
eight
half
in
a
daze
i
left
him
nor
did
i
see
him
again
that
day
nor
for
many
after
chapter
xi
who
giveth
this
woman
woman
is
a
miracle
of
divine
on
my
return
to
my
quarters
at
brown
i
looked
at
the
top
of
my
bureau
it
was
empty
my
friend
dandridge
had
proved
faithful
the
slipper
of
the
baroness
was
gone
so
now
hurriedly
i
began
my
toilet
for
that
occasion
which
to
any
gentleman
should
be
the
one
most
exacting
the
most
important
of
his
life
events
elisabeth
deserved
better
than
this
unseemly
haste
her
sweetness
and
dignity
her
adherence
to
the
forms
of
life
her
acquaintance
with
the
elegancies
the
dignities
and
conventions
of
the
best
of
our
society
bespoke
for
her
ceremony
more
suited
to
her
class
and
mine
nothing
could
excuse
these
hurly
burly
ways
save
only
my
love
our
uncertainty
regarding
my
future
presence
and
the
imperious
quality
of
my
duties
i
told
none
about
my
quarters
anything
of
my
plans
but
arranged
for
my
portmanteaus
to
be
sent
to
the
railway
station
for
that
evening
train
north
we
had
not
many
outgoing
and
incoming
trains
in
those
days
in
washington
i
hurried
to
bond
jewelry
place
and
secured
a
ring
two
rings
indeed
for
in
our
haste
betrothal
and
wedding
ring
needed
their
first
use
at
the
same
day
and
hour
i
found
a
waiting
carriage
which
served
my
purpose
and
into
it
i
flung
urging
the
driver
to
carry
me
at
top
speed
into
elmhurst
road
having
now
time
for
breath
i
sat
back
and
consulted
my
watch
there
were
a
few
moments
left
for
me
to
compose
myself
if
all
went
well
i
should
be
in
time
as
we
swung
down
the
road
i
leaned
forward
studying
with
interest
the
dust
cloud
of
an
approaching
carriage
as
it
came
near
i
called
to
my
driver
the
two
vehicles
paused
almost
wheel
to
wheel
it
was
my
friend
jack
dandridge
who
sprawled
on
the
rear
seat
of
the
carriage
that
is
to
say
the
fleshly
portion
of
jack
dandridge
his
mind
his
memory
and
all
else
were
gone
i
sprang
into
his
carriage
and
caught
him
roughly
by
the
arm
i
felt
in
all
his
pockets
looked
on
the
carriage
floor
on
the
seat
and
pulled
up
the
dust
rug
at
last
i
found
the
license
did
you
see
the
baroness
i
asked
then
at
this
he
beamed
upon
me
with
a
wide
smile
did
i
said
he
with
gravity
pulling
down
his
long
buff
waistcoat
did
i

all
the
worl
of

i
did

want
do
what

the
sudden
sweat

out
upon
my
forehead

shook
his
head
sadly
mishtaken
my
friend

turned

off
found
you
lo
th
bridegroom
cometh
late
my
only
answer
was
to
spring
from
his
carriage
into
my
own
and
to
order
my
driver
to
go
on
at
a
run
at
last
i
reached
the
driveway
of
elmhurst
my
carriage
wheels
cutting
the
gravel
as
we
galloped
up
to
the
front
door
my
approach
was
noted
even
as
i
hurried
up
the
steps
the
tall
form
of
none
other
than
daniel
churchill
appeared
to
greet
me
i
extended
my
hand
he
did
not
notice
it
i
began
to
speak
he
bade
me
pause
to
what
may
i
attribute
this
visit
mr
trist
he
asked
me
with
dignity
since
you
ask
me
and
seem
not
to
know
i
replied
i
may
say
that
i
am
here
to
marry
your
daughter
miss
elisabeth
i
presume
that
the
minister
of
the
gospel
is
already
here
the
minister
is
here
he
answered
there
lacks
one
thing
the
bride
what
do
you
mean
he
put
out
his
arm
across
the
door
i
regret
that
i
must
bar
my
door
to
you
but
you
must
take
my
word
as
coming
from
my
daughter
that
you
are
not
to
come
here
i
looked
at
him
my
eyes
staring
wide
i
could
not
believe
what
he
said
why
i
began
how
utterly
monstrous
a
step
sounded
in
the
hall
behind
him
and
he
turned
back
we
were
joined
by
the
tall
clerical
figure
of
the
reverend
doctor
halford
who
had
it
seemed
been
at
least
one
to
keep
his
appointment
as
made
he
raised
his
hand
as
if
to
silence
me
and
held
out
to
me
a
certain
object
it
was
the
slipper
of
the
baroness
helena
von
ritz
white
delicate
dainty
beribboned
miss
elisabeth
does
not
pretend
to
understand
why
your
gift
should
take
this
form
but
as
the
slipper
evidently
has
been
worn
by
some
one
she
suggests
you
may
perhaps
be
in
error
in
sending
it
at
all
he
spoke
in
even
icy
tones
let
me
into
this
house
i
demanded
i
must
see
her
there
were
two
tall
figures
now
who
stood
side
by
side
in
the
wide
front
door
but
do
you
see
there
has
been
a
mistake
a
horrible
mistake
i
demanded
doctor
halford
in
his
grave
and
quiet
way
assisted
himself
to
snuff
sir
he
said
knowing
both
families
i
agreed
to
this
haste
and
unceremoniousness
much
against
my
will
had
there
been
no
objection
upon
either
side
i
would
have
undertaken
to
go
forward
with
the
wedding
ceremony
but
never
in
my
life
have
i
and
never
shall
i
join
two
in
wedlock
when
either
is
not
in
that
state
of
mind
and
soul
consonant
with
that
holy
hour
this
ceremony
can
not
go
on
i
must
carry
to
you
this
young
lady
wish
that
you
depart
she
can
not
see
you
there
arose
in
my
heart
a
sort
of
feeling
of
horror
as
though
something
was
wrong
i
could
not
tell
what
all
at
once
i
felt
a
swift
revulsion
there
came
over
me
the
reaction
an
icy
calm
i
felt
all
ardor
leave
me
i
was
cold
as
stone
gentlemen
said
i
slowly
what
you
tell
me
is
absolutely
impossible
and
absurd
but
if
miss
elisabeth
really
doubts
me
on
evidence
such
as
this
i
would
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
ask
her
hand
some
time
you
and
she
may
explain
to
me
about
this
it
is
my
right
i
shall
exact
it
from
you
later
i
have
no
time
to
argue
now
they
looked
at
me
with
grave
faces
but
made
no
reply
i
descended
the
steps
the
dainty
beribboned
slipper
still
in
my
hand
got
into
my
carriage
and
started
back
to
the
city
chapter
xii
the
marathon
as
if
two
gods
should
play
some
heavenly
match
and
on
this
wager
lay
two
earthly
an
automaton
scarcely
thinking
i
gained
the
platform
of
the
station
there
was
a
sound
of
hissing
steam
a
rolling
cloud
of
sulphurous
smoke
a
shouting
of
railway
captains
a
creaking
of
the
wheels
without
volition
of
my
own
i
was
on
my
northward
journey
presently
i
looked
around
and
found
seated
at
my
side
the
man
whom
i
then
recollected
i
was
to
meet
doctor
samuel
ward
i
presume
he
took
the
train
after
i
did
what
wrong
nicholas
he
asked
trouble
of
any
kind
i
presume
that
the
harsh
quality
of
my
answer
surprised
him
he
looked
at
me
keenly
tell
me
what
up
my
son
said
he
you
know
miss
elisabeth
churchill
i
hesitated
he
nodded
yes
he
rejoined
and
damn
you
sir
if
you
give
that
girl
a
heartache
you
have
to
settle
with
me
some
one
will
have
to
settle
with
me
i
returned
hotly
tell
me
then
so
briefly
i
did
tell
him
what
little
i
knew
of
the
events
of
the
last
hour
i
told
him
of
the
shame
and
humiliation
of
it
all
he
pondered
for
a
minute
and
asked
me
at
length
if
i
believed
miss
elisabeth
suspected
anything
of
my
errand
of
the
night
before
how
could
she
i
answered
so
far
as
i
can
recollect
i
never
mentioned
the
name
of
the
baroness
von
ritz
then
all
at
once
i
did
recollect
i
did
remember
that
i
had
mentioned
the
name
of
the
baroness
that
very
morning
to
elisabeth
when
the
baroness
passed
us
in
the
east
room
i
had
not
told
the
truth
i
had
gone
with
a
lie
on
my
lips
that
very
day
and
asked
her
to
take
vows
with
me
in
which
no
greater
truth
ought
to
be
heard
than
the
simple
truth
from
me
to
her
in
any
hour
of
the
day
in
any
time
of
our
two
lives
doctor
ward
was
keen
enough
to
see
the
sudden
confusion
on
my
face
but
he
made
no
comment
beyond
saying
that
he
doubted
not
time
would
clear
it
all
up
that
he
had
known
many
such
affairs
but
mind
you
one
thing
he
added
keep
those
two
women
apart
then
why
do
you
two
doddering
old
idiots
you
and
john
calhoun
with
life
outworn
and
the
blood
dried
in
your
veins
send
me
since
you
doubt
me
so
much
on
an
errand
of
this
kind
you
see
what
it
has
done
for
me
i
am
done
with
john
calhoun
he
may
get
some
other
fool
for
his
service
where
do
you
propose
going
then
my
friend
west
i
answered
west
to
the
rockies
doctor
ward
calmly
produced
a
tortoise
shell
snuffbox
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
deliberately
took
snuff
you
are
going
to
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
he
calmly
you
are
going
to
keep
your
promise
to
john
calhoun
and
to
me
believe
me
the
business
in
hand
is
vital
you
go
to
canada
now
in
the
most
important
capacity
you
have
ever
had
i
care
nothing
for
that
i
answered
bitterly
but
you
are
the
agent
of
your
country
you
are
called
to
do
your
country
urgent
work
here
is
your
trouble
over
one
girl
would
you
make
trouble
for
a
million
american
girls
would
you
unsettle
thousands
and
thousands
of
american
homes
because
for
a
time
you
have
known
trouble
all
life
is
only
trouble
vanquished
i
ask
you
now
to
be
a
man
i
not
only
expect
it
but
demand
it
of
you
his
words
carried
weight
in
spite
of
myself
i
began
to
listen
i
took
from
his
hand
the
package
looked
at
it
examined
it
finally
as
he
sat
silently
regarding
me
i
broke
the
seal
now
nicholas
trist
resumed
doctor
ward
presently
there
is
to
be
at
montreal
at
the
date
named
in
these
papers
a
meeting
of
the
directors
of
the
hudson
bay
company
of
england
there
will
be
big
men
there
the
biggest
their
country
can
produce
leaders
of
the
hudson
bay
company
many
public
men
even
of
england
it
is
rumored
that
a
brother
of
lord
aberdeen
of
the
british
ministry
will
attend
do
you
begin
to
understand
ah
did
i
not
here
then
was
further
weaving
of
those
complex
plots
which
at
that
time
hedged
in
all
our
history
as
a
republic
now
i
guessed
the
virtue
of
our
knowing
somewhat
of
england
secret
plans
as
she
surely
did
of
ours
i
began
to
feel
behind
me
the
impulse
of
john
calhoun
swift
energy
it
is
oregon
i
exclaimed
at
last
doctor
ward
nodded
very
possibly
it
has
seemed
to
calhoun
very
likely
that
we
may
hear
something
of
great
importance
regarding
the
far
northwest
a
missed
cog
now
may
cost
this
country
a
thousand
miles
of
territory
a
hundred
years
of
history
doctor
ward
continued
england
as
you
know
said
he
is
the
enemy
of
this
country
as
much
as
ever
she
claims
she
wishes
texas
to
remain
free
she
forgets
her
own
record
forgets
the
burning
cities
of
rohilkhand
the
imprisoned
princesses
of
oudh
might
is
her
right
she
wants
texas
as
a
focus
of
contention
a
rallying
point
of
sectionalism
if
she
divides
us
she
conquers
us
that
is
all
she
wants
the
chance
for
the
extension
of
her
own
hold
on
this
continent
which
she
will
push
as
far
and
fast
as
she
dare
she
must
have
cotton
she
would
like
land
as
well
that
means
also
oregon
he
nodded
always
with
the
texas
question
comes
the
oregon
question
calhoun
is
none
too
friendly
to
polk
and
yet
he
knows
that
through
jackson
influence
with
the
southern
democracy
polk
has
an
excellent
chance
for
the
next
nomination
for
the
presidency
god
knows
what
folly
will
come
then
but
sometime
one
way
or
another
the
joint
occupancy
of
england
and
the
united
states
in
the
oregon
country
must
end
it
has
been
a
waiting
game
thus
far
as
you
know
but
never
think
that
england
has
been
idle
this
meeting
in
montreal
will
prove
that
to
you
in
spite
of
myself
i
began
to
feel
the
stimulus
of
a
thought
like
this
it
was
my
salvation
as
a
man
i
began
to
set
aside
myself
and
my
own
troubles
you
are
therefore
he
concluded
to
go
to
montreal
and
find
your
own
way
into
that
meeting
of
the
directors
of
the
hudson
bay
company
there
is
a
bare
chance
that
in
this
intrigue
mexico
will
have
an
emissary
on
the
ground
as
well
there
is
reason
to
suspect
her
hostility
to
all
our
plans
of
extension
southwest
and
northwest
naturally
it
is
the
card
of
mexico
to
bring
on
war
or
accept
it
if
we
urge
but
only
in
case
she
has
england
as
her
ally
england
will
get
her
pay
by
taking
texas
and
what
is
more
by
taking
california
which
mexico
does
not
value
she
owes
england
large
sums
now
that
would
leave
england
owner
of
the
pacific
coast
for
once
she
gets
california
she
will
fight
us
then
for
of
oregon
it
is
your
duty
to
learn
all
of
these
matters
who
is
there
what
is
done
and
to
do
this
without
making
known
your
own
identity
i
sat
for
a
moment
in
thought
it
is
an
honor
said
i
finally
an
honor
so
large
that
under
it
i
feel
small
now
said
doctor
ward
placing
a
gnarled
hand
on
my
shoulder
you
begin
to
talk
like
a
marylander
it
a
race
my
boy
a
race
across
this
continent
there
are
two
trails
one
north
and
one
on
these
paths
two
nations
contend
in
the
greatest
marathon
of
all
the
world
england
or
the
united
states
monarchy
or
republic
aristocracy
or
humanity
these
are
some
of
the
things
which
hang
on
the
issue
of
this
contest
take
then
your
duty
and
your
honor
humbly
and
faithfully
he
said
as
we
steamed
into
baltimore
station
i
turned
and
he
was
gone
chapter
xiii
on
secret
service
if
the
world
was
lost
through
woman
she
alone
can
save
de
in
the
days
of
which
i
write
our
civilization
was
as
i
may
say
so
embryonic
that
it
is
difficult
for
us
now
to
realize
the
conditions
which
then
obtained
we
had
great
men
in
those
days
and
great
deeds
were
done
but
as
one
reflects
upon
life
as
it
then
was
it
seems
almost
impossible
that
they
and
their
deeds
could
have
existed
in
a
time
so
crude
and
immature
the
means
of
travel
in
its
best
form
was
at
that
time
at
least
curious
we
had
several
broken
railway
systems
north
and
south
but
there
were
not
then
more
than
five
thousand
miles
of
railway
built
in
america
all
things
considered
i
felt
lucky
when
we
reached
new
york
less
than
hours
out
from
washington
from
new
york
northward
to
montreal
one
journey
involved
a
choice
of
routes
one
might
go
up
the
hudson
river
by
steamer
to
albany
and
thence
work
up
the
champlain
lake
system
above
which
one
might
employ
a
short
stretch
of
rails
between
john
and
la
prairie
on
the
banks
of
the
lawrence
opposite
montreal
or
one
might
go
from
albany
west
by
rail
as
far
as
syracuse
up
the
mohawk
valley
and
so
to
oswego
where
on
lake
ontario
one
might
find
steam
or
sailing
craft
up
the
hudson
i
took
the
crack
steamer
the
same
which
just
one
year
later
was
sunk
while
trying
to
beat
her
own
record
of
nine
hours
and
two
minutes
from
new
york
to
albany
she
required
eleven
hours
on
our
trip
under
conditions
then
obtaining
it
took
me
a
day
and
a
half
more
to
reach
lake
ontario
here
happily
i
picked
up
a
frail
steam
craft
owned
by
an
adventurous
soul
who
was
not
unwilling
to
risk
his
life
and
that
of
others
on
the
uncertain
and
waters
of
ontario
with
him
i
negotiated
to
carry
me
with
others
down
the
lawrence
at
that
time
of
course
the
lachine
canal
was
not
completed
and
the
victoria
bridge
was
not
even
conceived
as
a
possibility
one
delay
after
another
with
broken
machinery
lack
of
fuel
running
ice
and
what
not
required
five
days
more
of
my
time
ere
i
reached
montreal
i
could
not
be
called
either
officer
or
spy
yet
none
the
less
i
did
not
care
to
be
recognized
here
in
the
capacity
of
one
i
made
up
my
costume
as
that
of
an
innocent
free
trader
from
the
western
fur
country
of
the
states
and
was
able
from
my
earlier
experiences
to
answer
any
questions
as
to
beaver
at
fort
hall
or
buffalo
on
the
yellowstone
or
the
red
thus
i
passed
freely
in
and
about
all
the
public
places
of
the
town
and
inspected
with
a
certain
personal
interest
all
its
points
of
interest
from
the
gray
nunneries
to
the
new
cathedrals
the
place
the
champ
de
mars
the
barracks
the
vaunted
brewery
the
historic
mountain
and
the
village
lying
between
the
arms
of
the
two
rivers
a
point
where
history
for
a
great
country
had
been
made
and
where
history
for
our
own
now
was
planning
as
i
moved
about
from
day
to
day
making
such
acquaintance
as
i
could
i
found
in
the
air
a
feeling
of
excitement
and
expectation
the
hotels
bad
as
they
were
were
packed
the
public
places
were
noisy
the
private
houses
crowded
gradually
the
town
became
and
persons
of
importance
arrived
by
steamers
up
the
river
on
whose
expanse
lay
boats
which
might
be
bound
for
england
or
for
some
of
colonies
the
government
not
yet
removed
to
ottawa
later
capital
of
ontario
was
then
housed
in
the
old
château
ramezay
built
so
long
before
for
the
french
governor
vaudreuil
here
i
had
reason
to
believe
was
now
established
no
less
a
personage
than
sir
george
simpson
governor
of
the
hudson
bay
company
rumor
had
it
at
the
time
that
lord
aberdeen
of
england
himself
was
at
montreal
that
was
not
true
but
i
established
without
doubt
that
his
brother
really
was
there
as
well
as
lieutenant
william
peel
of
the
navy
son
of
sir
robert
peel
england
prime
minister
the
latter
with
his
companion
captain
parke
was
one
time
pointed
out
to
me
proudly
by
my
two
young
gentlemen
clad
in
the
ultra
fashion
of
their
country
with
very
wide
and
tall
bell
beavers
narrow
trousers
and
strange
long
unknown
to
us
in
the
states
of
little
shape
or
elegance
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
expectancy
in
the
air
that
was
sure
it
was
open
secret
enough
in
england
as
well
as
in
montreal
and
in
washington
that
a
small
army
of
american
settlers
had
set
out
the
foregoing
summer
for
the
valley
of
the
columbia
some
said
under
leadership
of
the
missionary
whitman
britain
was
this
year
awakening
to
the
truth
that
these
men
had
gone
thither
for
a
purpose
here
now
was
a
congress
of
great
statesmen
leaders
of
great
britain
greatest
monopoly
the
hudson
bay
company
to
weigh
this
act
of
the
audacious
american
republic
i
was
not
a
week
in
montreal
before
i
learned
that
my
master
guess
or
his
information
had
been
correct
the
race
was
on
for
oregon
all
these
things
i
say
i
saw
go
on
about
me
yet
in
truth
as
to
the
inner
workings
of
this
i
could
gain
but
little
actual
information
i
saw
england
ships
but
it
was
not
for
me
to
know
whether
they
were
to
turn
cape
hope
or
the
horn
i
saw
canada
but
they
might
be
only
on
their
annual
journey
and
might
go
no
farther
than
their
accustomed
posts
in
the
west
in
french
town
and
english
town
among
common
soldiers
and
merchants
i
wandered
for
more
than
one
day
and
felt
myself
still
helpless
that
is
to
say
such
was
the
case
until
there
came
to
my
aid
that
greatest
of
all
allies
chance
chapter
xiv
the
other
woman
the
world
is
the
book
of
i
needed
not
to
be
advised
that
presently
there
would
be
a
meeting
of
some
of
the
leading
men
of
the
hudson
bay
company
at
the
little
gray
stone
building
on
notre
dame
street
in
this
old
building
in
whose
vaults
at
one
time
of
emergency
was
stored
the
entire
currency
of
the
canadian
treasury
there
still
remained
some
government
records
and
now
under
the
roof
affairs
were
to
be
transacted
somewhat
larger
than
the
dimensions
of
the
building
might
have
suggested
the
keeper
of
my
inn
freely
made
me
a
list
of
those
who
would
be
present
a
list
embracing
so
many
scores
of
prominent
men
whom
he
then
swore
to
be
in
the
city
of
montreal
that
had
the
old
château
ramezay
afforded
twice
its
room
they
could
not
all
have
been
accommodated
for
myself
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
gain
admittance
in
those
days
all
montreal
was
after
nightfall
resembling
a
series
of
jails
and
it
seemed
doubly
screened
and
guarded
none
the
less
late
in
the
evening
i
allowed
seeming
accident
to
lead
me
in
a
certain
direction
passing
as
often
as
i
might
up
and
down
notre
dame
street
without
attracting
attention
i
saw
more
than
one
figure
in
the
enter
the
low
château
door
occasionally
a
tiny
gleam
showed
at
the
edge
of
a
shutter
or
at
the
top
of
some
little
window
not
fully
screened
as
to
what
went
on
within
i
could
only
guess
i
passed
the
château
up
and
down
at
different
times
from
nine
until
midnight
the
streets
of
montreal
at
that
time
made
brave
pretense
of
lighting
by
virtue
of
the
new
gas
works
at
certain
intervals
flickering
and
wholly
incompetent
lights
serving
to
make
the
gloom
more
visible
none
the
less
as
i
passed
for
the
last
time
i
plainly
saw
a
shaft
of
light
fall
upon
the
half
darkness
from
a
little
side
door
there
emerged
upon
the
street
the
figure
of
a
woman
i
do
not
know
what
led
me
to
cast
a
second
glance
for
certainly
my
business
was
not
with
ladies
any
more
than
i
would
have
supposed
ladies
had
business
there
but
victim
of
some
impulse
of
curiosity
i
walked
a
step
or
two
in
the
same
direction
as
that
taken
by
the
cloaked
figure
careless
as
i
endeavored
to
make
my
movements
the
veiled
lady
seemed
to
take
suspicion
or
fright
she
quickened
her
steps
accident
favored
me
even
as
she
fled
she
caught
her
skirt
on
some
object
which
lay
hidden
in
the
shadows
and
fell
almost
at
full
length
this
i
conceived
to
be
opportunity
warranting
my
approach
i
raised
my
hat
and
assured
her
that
her
flight
was
needless
she
made
no
direct
reply
to
me
but
as
she
rose
gave
utterance
to
an
expression
of
annoyance
dieu
i
heard
her
say
i
stood
for
a
moment
trying
to
recall
where
i
had
heard
this
same
voice
she
turned
her
face
in
such
a
way
that
the
light
illuminated
it
then
indeed
surprise
smote
me
madam
baroness
said
i
laughing
it
is
wholly
impossible
for
you
to
be
here
yet
you
are
here
never
again
will
i
say
there
is
no
such
thing
as
chance
no
such
thing
as
fate
no
such
thing
as
a
miracle
she
looked
at
me
one
brief
moment
then
her
courage
returned
ah
then
my
idiot
she
said
since
it
is
to
be
our
fortune
always
to
meet
of
dark
nights
and
in
impossible
ways
give
me
your
arm
i
laughed
we
may
as
well
make
treaty
if
you
run
again
i
shall
only
follow
you
then
i
am
again
your
prisoner
madam
i
again
am
yours
at
least
you
improve
said
she
then
come
shall
i
not
call
a
the
night
is
dark
no
no
hurriedly
we
began
a
midnight
course
that
took
us
quite
across
the
old
french
quarter
of
montreal
at
last
she
turned
into
a
small
dark
street
of
modest
residences
dark
and
cheerless
here
she
paused
in
front
of
a
narrow
iron
gate
madam
i
said
you
represent
to
me
one
of
the
problems
of
my
life
why
does
your
taste
run
to
such
quarters
as
these
this
might
be
that
same
back
street
in
washington
she
chuckled
to
herself
at
length
laughed
aloud
but
wait
if
you
entered
my
abode
once
she
said
why
not
again
come
her
hand
was
at
the
heavy
knocker
as
she
spoke
in
a
moment
the
door
slowly
opened
just
as
it
had
done
that
night
before
in
washington
my
companion
passed
before
me
swiftly
as
she
entered
i
saw
standing
at
the
opening
the
same
brown
and
wrinkled
old
dame
who
had
served
that
night
before
in
washington
for
an
instant
the
light
dazzled
my
eyes
but
determined
now
to
see
this
adventure
through
i
stepped
within
then
indeed
i
found
it
difficult
to
stifle
the
exclamation
of
surprise
which
came
to
my
lips
believe
it
or
not
as
you
like
we
again
in
washington
i
say
that
i
was
confronted
by
the
identical
arrangement
the
identical
objects
of
furnishing
which
had
marked
the
luxurious
boudoir
of
helena
von
ritz
in
washington
the
tables
were
the
same
the
chairs
the
mirrors
the
consoles
on
the
mantel
stood
the
same
girandoles
with
glittering
crystals
the
pictures
upon
the
walls
so
far
as
i
could
remember
their
themes
did
not
deviate
in
any
particular
of
detail
or
arrangement
the
chairs
were
duplicates
of
those
i
had
seen
that
other
night
at
midnight
beyond
these
same
amber
satin
curtains
stood
the
tall
bed
with
its
canopy
as
i
could
see
and
here
at
the
right
was
the
same
low
napoleon
bed
with
its
rolled
ends
the
figures
of
the
carpets
were
the
same
their
richness
soft
under
foot
the
same
the
flowered
cups
of
the
sconces
were
identical
with
those
i
had
seen
before
to
my
eye
even
as
it
grew
more
studious
there
appeared
no
divergence
no
difference
between
these
apartments
and
those
i
had
so
singularly
visited
and
yet
under
circumstances
so
strangely
akin
to
these
in
the
capital
of
my
own
country
you
are
good
enough
to
admire
my
modest
place
said
a
laughing
voice
at
my
shoulder
then
indeed
i
waked
and
looked
about
me
and
saw
that
this
stranger
than
any
mirage
of
the
brain
was
but
a
fact
and
must
later
be
explained
by
the
laborious
processes
of
the
feeble
reason
i
turned
to
her
then
pulling
myself
together
as
best
i
could
yes
she
too
was
the
same
although
in
this
case
costumed
somewhat
differently
the
wide
ball
gown
of
satin
was
gone
and
in
its
place
was
a
less
pretentious
robing
of
some
darker
silk
i
remembered
distinctly
that
the
flowers
upon
the
white
satin
gown
i
first
had
seen
were
pink
roses
here
were
flowers
of
the
crocus
cunningly
woven
into
the
web
of
the
gown
itself
the
slippers
which
i
now
saw
peeping
out
as
she
passed
were
not
of
white
satin
but
better
foot
covering
for
the
street
she
cast
over
the
back
of
a
chair
as
she
had
done
that
other
evening
her
light
shoulder
covering
a
dark
mantle
not
of
lace
now
but
of
some
thin
cloth
her
jewels
were
gone
and
the
splendor
of
her
dark
hair
was
free
of
decoration
no
pale
blue
fires
shone
at
her
white
throat
and
her
hands
were
ringless
but
the
light
firm
poise
of
her
figure
could
not
be
changed
the
mockery
of
her
glance
remained
the
same
half
laughing
and
half
wistful
the
strong
curve
of
her
lips
remained
and
i
recalled
this
arch
of
brow
the
curve
of
neck
and
chin
the
droop
of
the
dark
locks
above
her
even
forehead
yes
it
was
she
it
could
be
no
one
else
she
clapped
her
hands
and
laughed
like
a
child
as
she
turned
to
me
bravo
she
said
my
judgment
then
was
quite
correct
in
regard
to
what
yourself
pardon
me
you
do
not
show
curiosity
you
do
not
ask
me
questions
good
i
think
i
shall
ask
you
to
wait
i
say
to
you
frankly
that
i
am
alone
here
it
pleases
me
to
live
as
pleases
me
you
are
alone
in
montreal
why
should
we
not
please
ourselves
in
some
way
which
i
did
not
pause
to
analyze
i
felt
perfectly
sure
that
this
strange
woman
could
if
she
cared
to
do
so
tell
me
some
of
the
things
i
ought
to
know
she
might
be
here
on
some
errand
identical
with
my
own
calhoun
had
sent
for
her
once
before
whose
agent
was
she
now
i
found
chairs
for
us
both
an
instant
later
summoned
in
what
way
i
do
not
know
the
old
again
reappeared
wine
threlka
said
the
baroness
service
for
two
you
may
use
this
little
table
monsieur
she
added
turning
to
me
i
am
most
happy
to
make
even
some
slight
return
for
the
very
gracious
entertainment
offered
me
that
morning
by
calhoun
at
his
residence
such
a
droll
man
oh
la
la
are
you
his
friend
madam
i
asked
bluntly
why
should
i
not
be
i
could
frame
neither
offensive
nor
defensive
art
with
her
she
mocked
me
in
a
few
moments
the
weazened
old
woman
was
back
with
cold
fowl
wine
napery
silver
will
monsieur
carve
at
her
nod
the
old
woman
filled
my
glass
after
my
hostess
had
tasted
of
her
own
we
had
seated
ourselves
at
the
table
as
she
spoke
not
so
bad
for
a
black
midnight
eh
she
went
on
in
a
strange
town
and
on
a
strange
errand
and
again
let
me
express
my
approbation
of
your
conduct
if
it
pleases
you
is
more
than
i
can
say
of
it
for
myself
i
began
but
why
because
you
ask
no
questions
you
take
things
as
they
come
i
did
not
expect
you
would
come
to
montreal
then
you
know
but
of
course
i
told
you
have
you
then
no
question
she
went
on
at
last
her
glass
stood
half
full
her
wrists
rested
gently
on
the
table
edge
as
she
leaned
back
looking
at
me
with
that
on
her
face
which
he
had
needed
to
be
wiser
than
myself
who
could
have
read
may
i
then
yes
now
you
may
go
on
i
thank
you
first
of
course
for
what
reason
do
you
carry
the
secrets
of
my
government
into
the
stronghold
of
another
government
are
you
the
friend
of
america
or
are
you
a
spy
upon
america
are
you
my
friend
or
are
we
to
be
enemies
she
flung
back
her
head
and
laughed
delightedly
that
is
a
good
beginning
she
commented
you
must
at
a
guess
have
come
up
by
way
of
the
lakes
and
by
batteau
from
la
prairie
i
ventured
she
nodded
again
of
course
i
have
been
here
six
days
indeed
you
have
badly
beaten
me
in
our
little
race
she
flashed
on
me
a
sudden
glance
why
do
you
not
ask
me
outright
i
am
here
well
then
i
do
i
do
ask
you
that
i
ask
you
how
you
got
access
to
that
meeting
for
i
doubt
not
you
were
there
she
gazed
at
me
deliberately
again
parting
her
red
lips
again
smiling
at
me
what
would
you
have
given
to
have
been
there
yourself
all
the
treasures
those
vaults
ever
held
so
much
what
will
you
give
me
then
to
tell
you
what
i
know
more
than
all
that
treasure
madam
a
place
ah
a
in
the
heart
of
a
people
i
prefer
a
locality
more
restricted
in
my
own
heart
then
yes
of
course
she
helped
herself
daintily
to
a
portion
of
the
white
meat
of
the
fowl
yes
she
went
on
as
though
speaking
to
herself
on
the
whole
i
rather
like
him
yet
what
a
fool
ah
such
a
droll
idiot
how
so
madam
i
expostulated
i
thought
i
was
doing
very
well
yet
you
can
not
guess
how
to
persuade
me
no
how
could
that
be
always
one
gains
by
offering
some
equivalent
value
for
value
especially
with
women
monsieur
she
went
on
as
though
to
herself
come
now
i
fancy
him
he
is
handsome
he
is
discreet
he
has
courage
he
is
not
usual
he
is
not
curious
but
ah
what
a
fool
admit
me
to
be
a
fool
madam
since
it
is
true
but
tell
me
in
my
folly
what
equivalent
i
can
offer
one
who
has
everything
in
the
world
wealth
taste
culture
education
wit
learning
beauty
go
on
excellent
who
has
everything
as
against
my
nothing
value
madam
why
gentle
idiot
to
get
an
answer
ask
a
question
always
i
have
asked
it
but
you
can
not
guess
that
might
ask
one
so
then
one
answer
for
another
we
might
do
what
you
americans
call
some
business
eh
will
you
answer
question
ask
it
then
you
that
other
night
so
then
she
was
woman
after
all
and
curious
her
sudden
speech
came
like
a
stab
but
fortunately
my
dull
nerves
had
not
had
time
to
change
my
face
before
a
thought
flashed
into
my
mind
could
i
not
make
merchandise
of
my
sorrow
i
pulled
myself
into
control
and
looked
her
fair
in
the
face
madam
i
said
look
at
my
face
and
read
your
own
answer
she
looked
searching
me
while
every
nerve
of
me
tingled
but
at
last
she
shook
her
head
no
she
sighed
i
can
not
yet
say
she
did
not
see
the
sweat
starting
on
my
forehead
i
raised
my
kerchief
over
my
head
a
truce
then
madam
let
us
leave
the
one
question
against
the
other
for
a
time
excellent
i
shall
get
my
answer
first
in
that
case
and
for
nothing
how
so
i
shall
only
watch
you
as
we
are
here
now
i
were
a
fool
worse
than
you
if
i
could
not
tell
whether
or
not
you
are
married
none
the
less
i
commend
you
i
admire
you
because
you
do
not
tell
me
if
you
are
you
are
disappointed
if
you
you
are
eager
i
am
in
any
case
delighted
that
i
can
interest
madam
ah
but
you
do
i
have
not
been
interested
for
so
long
ah
the
great
heavens
how
fat
was
pakenham
how
thin
was
calhoun
but
you
come
monsieur
the
night
is
long
tell
me
of
yourself
i
have
never
before
known
a
savage
value
for
value
only
madam
will
you
tell
me
in
turn
of
yourself
all
she
looked
at
me
curiously
only
so
much
as
madam
wishes
i
saw
her
dark
eyes
study
me
once
more
at
last
she
spoke
again
at
least
she
said
it
would
be
rather
vulgar
if
i
did
not
explain
some
of
the
things
which
become
your
right
to
know
when
i
ask
you
to
come
into
this
home
as
into
my
other
home
in
washington
in
heaven
name
how
many
of
these
homes
have
you
then
are
they
all
alike
five
only
now
she
replied
in
the
most
manner
in
the
world
and
of
course
all
quite
alike
where
else
in
paris
in
vienna
in
london
she
answered
you
see
this
one
you
see
them
all
is
far
cooler
in
montreal
than
in
washington
in
the
summer
time
do
you
not
approve
the
arrangement
could
not
be
surpassed
thank
you
so
i
have
thought
the
mere
charm
of
difference
does
not
appeal
to
me
certain
things
my
judgment
approves
they
serve
they
suffice
this
little
scheme
it
has
pleased
me
to
reproduce
in
some
of
the
capitals
of
the
world
it
is
at
least
as
well
chosen
as
the
taste
of
the
prince
of
orleans
son
of
louis
philippe
could
advise
this
with
no
change
of
expression
i
drew
a
long
breath
she
went
on
as
though
i
had
spoken
my
friend
she
said
do
not
despise
me
too
early
there
is
abundant
time
before
you
judge
let
the
testimony
be
heard
i
love
men
who
can
keep
their
own
tongues
and
their
own
hands
to
themselves
i
am
not
your
judge
madam
but
it
will
be
long
before
i
shall
think
a
harsh
thought
of
you
tell
me
what
a
woman
may
do
not
tell
me
what
a
secret
agent
may
i
ask
no
promises
and
make
none
you
are
very
beautiful
you
have
wealth
i
call
you
you
are
married
i
was
married
at
fifteen
at
fifteen
and
your
husband
died
he
disappeared
your
own
country
was
austria
call
me
anything
but
austrian
i
left
my
country
because
i
saw
there
only
oppression
and
lack
of
hope
no
i
am
hungarian
that
i
could
have
guessed
they
say
the
most
beautiful
women
of
the
world
come
from
that
country
thank
you
is
that
all
i
should
guess
then
perhaps
you
went
to
paris
of
course
she
said
of
course
of
course
in
time
reasons
existed
why
i
should
not
return
to
my
home
i
had
some
little
fortune
some
singular
experiences
some
ambitions
of
my
own
what
i
did
i
did
at
least
i
saw
the
best
and
worst
of
europe
she
raised
a
hand
as
though
to
brush
something
from
before
her
face
allow
me
to
give
you
wine
well
then
monsieur
knows
that
when
i
left
paris
i
felt
that
part
of
my
studies
were
complete
i
had
seen
a
little
more
of
government
a
little
more
of
humanity
a
little
more
of
life
a
little
more
of
men
it
was
not
men
but
mankind
that
i
studied
most
i
had
seen
much
of
injustice
and
hopelessness
and
despair
these
made
the
fate
of
mankind
in
that
world
i
have
heard
vaguely
of
some
such
things
madam
i
said
i
know
that
in
europe
they
have
still
the
fight
which
we
sought
to
settle
when
we
left
that
country
for
this
one
she
nodded
so
then
at
last
she
went
on
still
young
having
learned
something
and
having
now
those
means
of
carrying
on
my
studies
which
i
required
i
came
to
this
last
of
the
countries
america
where
if
anywhere
hope
for
mankind
remains
washington
has
impressed
me
more
than
any
capital
of
the
world
how
long
have
you
been
in
washington
i
asked
now
you
begin
to
question
now
you
show
at
last
curiosity
well
then
i
shall
answer
for
more
than
one
year
perhaps
more
than
two
perhaps
more
than
three
impossible
i
shook
my
head
a
woman
like
you
could
not
be
concealed
not
if
she
owned
a
hundred
hidden
places
such
as
this
oh
i
was
known
she
said
you
have
heard
of
me
you
knew
of
me
i
still
shook
my
head
no
said
i
i
have
been
far
in
the
west
for
several
years
and
have
come
to
washington
but
rarely
bear
me
out
i
had
not
been
there
my
third
day
before
i
found
you
we
sat
silent
for
some
moments
fixedly
regarding
each
other
i
have
said
that
a
more
beautiful
face
than
hers
i
had
never
seen
there
sat
upon
it
now
many
things
youth
eagerness
ambition
a
certain
defiance
but
above
all
a
pleading
pathos
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
eager
as
i
was
to
question
her
further
apparently
she
valued
this
reticence
you
condemn
me
she
asked
at
length
because
i
live
alone
because
quiet
rumor
wags
a
tongue
you
will
judge
me
by
your
own
creed
and
not
by
mine
i
hesitated
before
i
answered
and
deliberated
madam
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
would
not
i
say
once
more
that
i
accredit
you
with
living
up
to
your
own
creed
whatever
that
may
have
been
she
drew
a
long
breath
in
turn
monsieur
you
have
done
yourself
no
ill
turn
in
that
it
was
rumored
in
diplomatic
circles
of
course
that
you
were
in
touch
with
the
ministry
of
england
i
ventured
i
myself
saw
that
much
naturally
of
mexico
also
at
least
as
you
saw
in
our
little
carriage
race
mexico
was
desirous
enough
to
establish
some
sort
of
communication
with
my
humble
self
calhoun
was
right
i
exclaimed
he
was
entirely
right
madam
in
insisting
that
i
should
bring
you
to
him
that
morning
whether
or
not
you
wished
to
go
whim
fits
with
whim
sometimes
his
whim
to
see
me
mine
to
go
i
wonder
what
the
queen
of
sheba
would
have
said
had
solomon
met
her
thus
she
chuckled
at
the
memory
you
see
when
you
left
me
at
door
in
care
of
the
grand
vizier
james
i
wondered
somewhat
at
this
strange
country
of
america
the
was
dim
and
the
grand
vizier
was
slow
with
candles
i
half
fell
into
the
room
on
the
right
there
was
calhoun
bolt
upright
in
his
chair
both
hands
spread
out
on
the
arms
as
you
promised
he
wore
a
red
nightcap
and
long
gown
of
wool
he
was
asleep
and
ah
how
weary
he
seemed
never
have
i
seen
a
face
so
sad
as
his
asleep
he
was
gray
and
thin
his
hair
was
gray
and
thin
his
eyes
were
sunken
the
veins
were
corded
at
his
temples
his
hands
were
transparent
he
was
as
you
promised
me
old
yet
when
i
saw
him
i
did
not
smile
he
heard
me
stir
as
i
would
have
withdrawn
and
when
he
arose
to
his
feet
he
was
monsieur
he
is
a
great
man
because
even
so
clad
he
made
no
more
apology
than
you
do
showed
no
more
curiosity
and
he
welcomed
me
quite
as
a
gentleman
unashamed
as
a
king
if
you
please
how
did
he
receive
you
madam
i
asked
i
never
knew
why
took
my
hand
in
both
his
and
bowed
as
though
i
indeed
were
queen
he
a
king
then
you
got
on
well
truly
for
he
was
wiser
than
his
agent
monsieur
he
found
answers
by
asking
questions
ah
you
were
kinder
to
him
than
to
me
naturally
for
instance
he
asked
what
had
been
my
ball
gown
that
night
who
was
there
how
i
enjoyed
myself
in
a
moment
we
were
talking
as
though
we
had
been
friends
for
years
the
grand
vizier
brought
in
two
mugs
of
cider
in
each
a
toasted
apple
monsieur
i
have
not
seen
diplomacy
such
as
this
naturally
i
was
helpless
did
he
perhaps
ask
how
you
were
induced
to
come
at
so
impossible
a
time
my
own
vanity
naturally
leads
me
to
ask
so
much
as
that
no
calhoun
confined
himself
to
the
essentials
even
had
he
asked
me
i
could
not
have
replied
because
i
do
not
know
save
that
it
was
to
me
a
whim
but
at
least
we
talked
over
our
cider
and
toasted
apples
you
told
him
somewhat
of
yourself
he
did
not
allow
me
to
do
that
monsieur
but
he
told
you
somewhat
of
this
country
ah
yes
yes
so
then
i
saw
what
held
him
up
in
his
work
what
kept
him
alive
i
saw
something
i
have
not
often
seen
a
purpose
a
principle
in
a
public
man
his
love
for
his
own
land
touched
even
me
how
or
why
i
scarcely
know
yes
we
spoke
of
the
poor
the
oppressed
of
the
weary
and
the
heavy
laden
did
he
ask
you
what
you
knew
of
mexico
and
england
rather
what
i
knew
of
the
poor
in
europe
i
told
him
some
things
i
knew
of
that
hopeless
land
that
country
my
own
land
then
he
went
on
to
tell
me
of
america
and
its
hope
of
a
free
democracy
of
the
people
believe
me
i
listened
to
calhoun
never
mind
what
we
said
of
van
zandt
and
sir
richard
pakenham
at
least
as
you
know
i
paid
off
a
little
score
with
sir
richard
that
next
morning
what
was
strangest
to
me
was
the
fact
that
i
forgot
calhoun
attire
forgot
the
strangeness
of
my
errand
thither
it
was
as
though
only
our
minds
talked
one
with
the
other
i
was
sorry
when
at
last
came
the
grand
vizier
james
to
take
calhoun
order
for
his
own
carriage
that
brought
me
home
my
second
and
more
peaceful
arrival
there
that
night
the
last
i
saw
of
calhoun
was
with
the
grand
vizier
james
putting
a
cloak
about
him
and
leading
him
by
force
from
his
study
to
his
bed
as
i
presume
as
for
me
i
slept
no
more
that
night
monsieur
i
admit
that
i
saw
the
purpose
of
a
great
man
yes
and
of
a
great
country
then
i
did
not
fail
as
messenger
after
all
you
told
calhoun
what
he
desired
to
know
in
part
at
least
but
come
now
was
i
not
bound
in
some
sort
of
honor
to
my
great
and
good
friend
sir
richard
was
it
not
treachery
enough
to
rebuke
him
for
his
attentions
to
the
doña
lucrezia
but
you
promised
to
tell
calhoun
more
at
a
later
time
on
certain
conditions
i
did
she
assented
i
do
not
know
that
i
may
ask
those
you
would
be
surprised
if
i
told
you
the
truth
what
i
required
of
calhoun
was
permission
and
aid
still
further
to
study
his
extraordinary
country
its
extraordinary
ways
its
extraordinary
ignorance
of
itself
i
have
told
you
that
i
needed
to
travel
to
study
to
observe
mankind
and
those
governments
invented
or
tolerated
by
mankind
since
then
madam
i
concluded
stepping
to
assist
her
with
her
chair
as
she
signified
her
completion
of
our
repast
since
you
do
not
feel
now
inclined
to
be
specific
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
make
my
adieux
for
the
time
at
least
it
grows
late
i
shall
remember
this
little
evening
all
my
life
i
own
my
defeat
i
do
not
know
why
you
are
here
or
for
whom
at
what
hotel
do
you
stop
the
little
place
of
jacques
bertillon
a
square
or
so
beyond
the
place
in
that
case
said
she
believe
me
it
would
be
more
discreet
for
you
to
remain
unseen
in
montreal
no
matter
which
flag
is
mine
i
may
say
that
much
for
a
friend
and
comrade
in
the
service
but
what
else
she
looked
about
her
be
my
guest
she
said
suddenly
there
is
danger
for
me
i
laughed
at
my
hotel
on
the
streets
no
for
me
where
here
and
of
what
madam
of
a
man
for
the
first
time
i
am
afraid
in
spite
of
all
i
looked
at
her
straight
are
you
not
afraid
of
i
asked
she
looked
at
me
fairly
her
color
coming
with
the
fear
which
draws
a
woman
to
a
man
she
said
whereas
mine
is
the
fear
which
causes
a
man
to
flee
from
himself
but
you
will
remain
for
my
protection
i
should
feel
safer
besides
in
that
case
i
should
know
the
answer
how
do
you
mean
i
should
know
whether
or
not
you
were
married
chapter
xv
with
madam
the
baroness
it
is
not
for
good
women
that
men
have
fought
battles
given
their
lives
and
staked
their
but
madam
i
began
she
answered
me
in
her
own
way
monsieur
hesitates
he
is
lost
she
said
but
see
i
am
weary
i
have
been
much
engaged
i
have
made
it
my
plan
never
to
fatigue
myself
it
is
my
hour
now
for
my
bath
my
exercise
my
bed
if
you
please
i
fear
i
must
bid
you
good
night
one
way
or
the
other
you
will
be
welcome
here
none
the
less
if
you
care
to
remain
i
trust
you
did
not
find
our
little
repast
unpleasing
believe
me
our
breakfast
shall
be
as
good
threlka
is
expert
in
omelets
and
our
coffee
is
such
as
perhaps
you
may
not
find
general
in
these
provinces
was
there
the
slightest
mocking
sneer
in
her
words
did
she
despise
me
as
a
i
could
not
tell
but
did
not
like
the
thought
believe
me
madam
i
answered
hotly
you
have
courage
at
least
let
me
match
it
nor
do
i
deny
that
this
asks
courage
on
my
part
too
if
you
please
in
these
circumstances
shall
you
are
armed
she
asked
simply
i
inserted
a
finger
in
each
waistcoat
pocket
and
showed
her
the
butts
of
two
derringers
and
at
the
back
of
my
neck
to
her
smiling
amusement
at
our
heathen
fashion
i
displayed
just
the
tip
of
the
haft
of
a
short
which
went
into
a
leather
case
under
the
collar
of
my
coat
and
again
i
drew
around
the
belt
which
i
wore
so
that
she
could
see
the
barrel
of
a
good
pistol
which
had
been
suspended
under
cover
of
the
bell
skirt
of
my
coat
she
laughed
i
saw
that
she
was
not
unused
to
weapons
i
should
have
guessed
her
the
daughter
of
a
soldier
or
acquainted
with
arms
in
some
way
of
course
she
said
there
might
be
need
of
these
although
i
think
not
and
in
any
case
if
trouble
can
be
deferred
until
why
concern
oneself
over
it
you
interest
me
i
begin
yet
more
to
approve
of
you
then
as
to
that
breakfast
la
with
madam
if
i
remain
will
you
agree
to
tell
me
what
is
your
business
here
she
laughed
at
me
gaily
i
might
she
said
provided
that
meantime
i
had
learned
whether
or
not
you
were
married
that
night
i
do
not
profess
that
i
read
all
that
was
in
her
face
as
she
stepped
back
toward
the
satin
curtains
and
swept
me
the
most
graceful
curtsey
i
had
ever
seen
in
all
my
life
i
felt
like
reaching
out
a
hand
to
restrain
her
i
felt
like
following
her
she
was
assuredly
bewildering
assuredly
as
puzzling
as
she
was
fascinating
i
only
felt
that
she
was
mocking
me
ah
she
was
a
woman
i
felt
something
swiftly
flame
within
me
there
arose
about
me
that
net
of
perfume
soft
enthralling
difficult
of
evasion
then
i
recalled
my
mission
and
i
remembered
what
calhoun
and
doctor
ward
had
said
i
was
not
a
man
i
was
a
government
agent
she
was
not
a
woman
she
was
my
opponent
yes
but
then
slowly
i
turned
to
the
opposite
side
of
this
long
central
room
there
were
curtains
here
also
i
drew
them
but
as
i
did
so
i
glanced
back
again
as
on
that
earlier
night
i
saw
her
face
framed
in
the
amber
folds
a
face
laughing
mocking
with
an
exclamation
of
discontent
i
threw
down
my
heavy
pistol
on
the
floor
cast
my
coat
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
to
prevent
the
delicate
covering
from
being
soiled
by
my
boots
and
so
rested
without
further
disrobing
in
the
opposite
apartment
i
could
hear
her
moving
about
humming
to
herself
some
air
as
unconcernedly
as
though
no
such
being
as
myself
existed
in
the
world
i
heard
her
presently
accost
her
servant
who
entered
through
some
passage
not
visible
from
the
central
apartments
then
without
concealment
there
seemed
to
go
forward
the
ordinary
routine
of
madam
toilet
for
the
evening
no
i
think
the
pink
one
i
heard
her
say
and
please
the
bath
threlka
just
a
trifle
more
warm
she
spoke
in
french
her
ancient
as
i
took
it
not
understanding
the
english
language
they
both
spoke
also
in
a
tongue
i
did
not
know
i
heard
the
rattling
of
toilet
articles
certain
sighs
of
content
faint
splashings
beyond
i
could
not
escape
from
all
this
then
i
imagined
that
perhaps
madam
was
having
her
heavy
locks
combed
by
the
in
spite
of
myself
i
pictured
her
thus
even
more
beautiful
than
before
for
a
long
time
i
concluded
that
my
presence
was
to
be
dismissed
as
a
thing
which
was
of
no
importance
or
which
was
to
be
regarded
as
not
having
happened
at
length
however
after
what
seemed
at
least
half
an
hour
of
these
mysterious
ceremonies
i
heard
certain
sighings
long
breaths
as
though
madam
were
taking
calisthenic
movements
some
gymnastic
training
i
knew
not
what
she
paused
for
breath
apparently
very
well
content
with
herself
shame
on
me
i
fancied
perhaps
she
stood
before
a
mirror
shame
on
me
again
i
fancied
she
sat
glowing
beautiful
at
the
edge
of
the
amber
couch
at
last
she
called
out
to
me
monsieur
i
was
at
my
own
curtains
at
once
but
hers
remained
tight
folded
although
i
heard
her
voice
close
behind
them
bien
i
answered
it
is
nothing
except
i
would
say
that
if
monsieur
feels
especially
grave
and
reverent
he
will
find
a
very
comfortable
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
thank
you
i
replied
gravely
as
i
could
and
there
is
a
very
excellent
rosary
and
crucifix
on
the
table
just
beyond
i
thank
you
i
replied
steadily
as
i
could
and
there
is
an
english
book
of
common
prayer
upon
the
stand
not
far
from
the
head
of
the
bed
upon
this
side
a
thousand
thanks
my
very
good
friend
i
heard
a
smothered
laugh
beyond
the
amber
curtains
presently
she
spoke
again
yawning
as
i
fancied
rather
contentedly
la
bonne
heure
monsieur
la
bonne
heure
madame
chapter
xvi
déjeûner
à
la
fourchette
woman
is
a
creature
between
man
and
the
angels
de
a
government
agent
it
seems
may
also
in
part
be
little
more
than
a
man
after
all
in
these
singular
surroundings
i
found
myself
not
wholly
tranquil
at
last
toward
morning
i
must
have
slept
it
was
some
time
after
daybreak
when
i
felt
a
hand
upon
my
shoulder
as
i
lay
still
partly
clad
awakened
suddenly
i
arose
and
almost
overthrew
old
threlka
who
stood
regarding
me
with
no
expression
whatever
upon
her
brown
and
wrinkled
countenance
she
did
no
more
than
point
the
way
to
a
door
where
presently
i
found
a
and
so
refreshed
myself
and
made
the
best
toilet
possible
under
the
circumstances
my
hostess
i
found
awaiting
me
in
the
central
room
of
the
apartments
she
was
clad
now
in
a
girdled
peignoir
of
rich
the
sleeves
wide
and
full
falling
hack
from
her
round
arms
her
dark
hair
was
coiled
and
piled
high
on
her
head
this
morning
regardless
of
current
mode
and
confined
in
a
heavy
twist
by
a
tall
golden
comb
so
that
her
white
neck
was
left
uncovered
she
wore
no
jewelry
and
as
she
stood
simple
and
free
from
any
trickery
of
the
coquette
i
thought
that
few
women
ever
were
more
fair
that
infinite
witchery
not
given
to
many
women
was
hers
yet
dignity
as
well
she
was
i
swear
though
young
and
beautiful
as
a
goddess
her
brow
was
thoughtful
now
her
air
more
demure
faint
blue
shadows
lay
beneath
her
eyes
a
certain
hauteur
it
seemed
to
me
was
visible
in
her
mien
yet
she
was
the
soul
of
graciousness
and
i
must
admit
as
charming
a
hostess
as
ever
invited
one
to
usual
or
unusual
repast
the
little
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
was
already
spread
madam
filled
my
cup
from
the
steaming
urn
with
not
the
slightest
awkwardness
as
she
nodded
for
me
to
be
seated
we
looked
at
each
other
and
as
i
may
swear
we
both
broke
into
saving
laughter
so
we
sat
easier
now
as
i
admit
and
with
small
concern
for
the
affairs
of
the
world
outside
at
the
time
discussed
the
very
excellent
omelet
which
certainly
did
not
allow
the
reputation
of
threlka
to
suffer
the
delicately
grilled
bones
the
crisp
toasted
rye
bread
the
firm
yellow
butter
the
pungent
early
cress
which
made
up
a
meal
sufficiently
dainty
even
for
her
who
presided
over
it
even
that
pitiless
light
of
early
morning
the
merciless
of
opposing
windows
was
gentle
with
her
yes
she
was
young
moreover
she
ate
as
a
person
of
breeding
and
seemed
thoroughbred
in
all
ways
if
one
might
use
a
term
so
hackneyed
rank
and
breeding
had
been
hers
she
needed
not
to
claim
them
for
they
told
their
own
story
i
wondered
what
extraordinary
history
of
hers
remained
untold
what
history
of
hers
and
mine
and
of
others
she
might
yet
assist
in
making
i
was
saying
she
remarked
presently
that
i
would
not
have
you
think
that
i
do
not
appreciate
the
suffering
in
which
you
were
plunged
by
the
haste
you
found
necessary
in
the
wedding
of
your
but
i
was
on
my
guard
at
least
i
may
thank
you
for
your
sympathy
madam
i
replied
yet
in
time
she
went
on
gone
reflective
the
next
instant
you
will
see
how
very
unimportant
is
all
this
turmoil
of
love
and
marriage
indeed
there
is
as
you
say
something
of
a
turmoil
regarding
them
in
our
institutions
as
they
are
at
present
formed
because
the
average
of
humanity
thinks
so
little
most
of
us
judge
life
from
its
emotions
we
do
not
search
the
depths
if
i
could
oblige
madam
by
abolishing
society
and
home
and
humanity
i
should
be
very
glad
because
of
course
that
is
what
madam
means
at
any
cost
she
mused
that
torture
of
life
must
be
passed
on
to
coming
generations
for
their
unhappiness
their
grief
their
misery
i
presume
it
was
necessary
that
there
should
be
this
plan
of
the
general
blindness
and
intensity
of
passion
yes
if
indeed
it
be
not
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
for
us
to
marry
at
least
it
is
important
that
we
should
think
so
madam
is
philosopher
this
morning
i
said
smiling
she
hardly
heard
me
to
continue
the
crucifixion
of
the
soul
to
continue
the
misapprehensions
the
debasings
of
contact
with
human
life
yes
i
suppose
one
must
pay
all
that
for
the
sake
of
the
gaining
of
a
purpose
yet
there
are
those
who
would
endure
much
for
the
sake
of
principle
monsieur
some
such
souls
are
born
do
you
not
think
yes
sphinx
souls
extraordinary
impossible
for
the
average
of
us
to
understand
that
torch
of
she
mused
see
it
was
only
which
you
were
so
eager
to
pass
on
to
another
generation
that
was
why
you
were
so
mad
to
hasten
to
the
side
of
that
woman
whereas
she
mused
still
it
were
so
much
grander
and
so
much
nobler
to
pass
on
the
torch
of
a
as
well
i
do
not
understand
the
general
business
of
offspring
goes
on
unceasingly
in
all
the
nations
she
resumed
frankly
there
will
be
children
whether
or
not
you
and
i
ever
find
some
one
wherewith
to
mate
in
the
compromise
which
folk
call
wedlock
but
ah
my
friend
who
is
to
give
those
to
others
who
follow
us
what
rare
and
splendid
wedlock
brings
forth
manner
of
offspring
madam
in
the
circumstances
said
i
i
should
be
happy
to
serve
you
more
omelet
she
shook
her
head
as
though
endeavoring
to
dismiss
something
from
her
mind
do
not
philosophize
with
me
i
said
i
am
already
distracted
by
the
puzzle
you
offer
to
me
you
are
so
young
and
beautiful
so
fair
in
your
judgment
so
kind
in
turn
i
ask
you
not
to
follow
that
she
remarked
coldly
let
us
talk
of
what
you
call
i
think
business
nothing
could
please
me
more
i
have
slept
little
pondering
on
this
that
i
do
call
business
to
begin
with
then
you
were
there
at
the
château
ramezay
last
night
i
would
have
given
all
i
had
to
have
been
there
for
an
hour
there
are
certain
advantages
a
woman
may
have
but
you
were
there
you
know
what
went
forward
certainly
did
they
know
you
were
present
monsieur
is
somewhat
importunate
she
looked
me
now
directly
in
the
eye
studying
me
mercilessly
with
a
scrutiny
whose
like
i
should
not
care
often
to
undergo
i
should
be
glad
if
it
were
possible
to
answer
you
she
said
at
last
enigmatically
but
i
have
faith
to
keep
with
others
with
you
with
myself
now
my
own
eagerness
ran
away
with
me
i
became
almost
rude
madam
i
exclaimed
why
beat
about
the
bush
i
do
not
care
to
deceive
you
and
you
must
not
deceive
me
why
should
we
not
be
friends
in
every
way
and
fair
ones
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
she
said
simply
are
you
then
an
enemy
of
my
country
i
demanded
if
i
thought
you
were
here
to
prove
traitress
to
my
country
you
should
never
leave
this
room
except
with
me
you
shall
not
leave
it
now
until
you
have
told
me
what
you
are
why
you
are
here
what
you
plan
to
do
she
showed
no
fear
she
only
made
a
pretty
little
gesture
at
the
dishes
between
us
at
my
own
table
she
pouted
again
our
eyes
met
directly
and
again
hers
did
not
lower
she
looked
at
me
calmly
i
was
no
match
for
her
my
dear
lady
i
began
again
my
relation
to
the
affairs
of
the
american
republic
is
a
very
humble
one
i
am
no
minister
of
state
and
i
know
you
deal
with
ministers
direct
how
then
shall
i
gain
your
friendship
for
my
country
you
are
dangerous
to
have
for
an
enemy
are
you
too
to
have
for
a
friend
for
a
friend
to
our
union
a
friend
of
the
principle
of
democracy
come
now
you
enjoy
large
questions
tell
me
what
does
this
council
mean
regarding
oregon
is
it
true
that
england
plans
now
to
concentrate
all
her
traders
all
her
troops
and
force
them
west
up
the
saskatchewan
and
into
oregon
this
coming
season
come
now
madam
is
it
to
be
war
her
curved
lips
broke
into
a
smile
that
showed
again
her
small
white
teeth
were
you
then
married
she
said
i
only
went
on
impatient
any
moment
may
mean
everything
to
us
i
should
not
ask
these
questions
if
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
close
to
mr
calhoun
she
looked
me
square
in
the
eye
and
nodded
her
head
slowly
i
may
say
this
much
monsieur
that
it
has
pleased
me
to
gain
a
little
further
information
you
will
give
my
government
that
information
why
should
i
yet
you
spoke
of
others
who
might
come
here
what
others
who
are
they
the
representatives
of
mexico
some
attaché
of
the
british
embassy
at
washington
some
minister
from
england
itself
sent
here
direct
she
smiled
at
me
again
i
told
you
not
to
go
back
to
your
hotel
did
i
not
i
got
no
further
with
her
it
seemed
you
interest
me
sometimes
she
went
on
slowly
at
last
yet
you
seem
to
have
so
little
brain
now
in
your
employment
i
should
think
that
brain
would
be
somewhat
useful
at
times
i
do
not
deny
that
suggestion
madam
but
you
are
unable
to
analyze
thus
in
the
matter
of
yourself
i
suppose
if
you
were
told
of
it
you
would
only
say
that
you
forgot
to
look
in
the
toe
of
the
slipper
you
had
thus
far
baroness
i
said
soberly
i
have
asked
no
special
privilege
at
least
now
if
it
affords
you
any
pleasure
i
you
i
you
to
tell
me
what
you
mean
did
you
credit
the
attaché
of
mexico
with
being
nothing
more
than
a
drunken
rowdy
to
follow
me
across
town
with
a
little
shoe
in
his
carriage
but
you
said
he
was
in
wine
true
but
would
that
be
a
reason
continually
you
show
your
lack
of
brain
in
accepting
as
conclusive
results
which
could
not
possibly
have
occurred
he
was
in
wine
he
followed
me
he
had
my
shoe
in
his
possession
what
then
does
it
follow
that
at
the
ball
at
the
white
house
he
could
have
removed
that
shoe
does
monsieur
think
that
i
too
was
in
wine
i
agree
that
i
have
no
brain
i
can
not
guess
what
you
mean
i
can
only
beg
once
more
that
you
explain
now
listen
in
your
most
youthful
and
charming
innocence
i
presume
you
do
not
know
much
of
the
capabilities
for
concealment
offered
by
a
apparel
now
suppose
i
had
a
message
where
do
you
think
i
could
hide
it
granted
of
course
the
conditions
obtaining
at
a
ball
in
the
white
house
then
you
did
have
a
message
it
came
to
you
there
at
that
time
she
nodded
certainly
van
zandt
had
almost
no
other
opportunity
to
meet
me
or
get
word
to
me
zandt
madam
are
you
indeed
in
the
camp
of
these
different
interests
so
what
pakenham
said
was
true
van
zandt
is
the
attaché
of
texas
van
zandt
is
pleading
with
calhoun
that
he
shall
take
up
the
secretaryship
van
zandt
promises
us
the
friendship
of
texas
if
we
will
stand
out
for
the
annexation
of
texas
van
zandt
promises
us
every
effort
in
his
power
against
england
van
zandt
promises
us
the
sternest
of
fronts
against
treacherous
mexico
van
zandt
is
known
to
be
interested
in
this
fair
doña
lucrezia
just
as
polk
is
now
then
comes
van
zandt
with
his
secret
message
slipped
into
the
hand
of
madam
at
the
ambassador
ball
madam
friend
of
england
the
attaché
of
mexico
is
curious
furious
to
know
what
texas
is
saying
to
england
and
that
message
must
be
concealed
and
madam
conceals
it
in
she
smiled
at
me
brilliantly
you
come
on
she
said
should
your
head
be
opened
and
analyzed
yes
i
think
a
trace
of
brain
might
be
discovered
by
good
chemistry
i
resumed
impatiently
you
put
his
message
in
your
slipper
she
nodded
yes
she
said
in
the
toe
of
it
there
was
barely
chance
to
do
that
you
see
our
skirts
are
full
and
wide
there
are
curtains
in
the
east
room
there
was
wine
by
this
time
there
was
music
so
i
effected
that
much
but
when
you
took
the
slipper
you
took
van
note
you
had
it
it
was
true
what
i
told
pakenham
before
the
president
i
did
then
have
that
note
had
it
at
least
i
you
had
it
till
i
found
it
crumpled
on
the
table
the
next
day
it
must
have
fallen
there
from
the
shoe
when
we
made
our
little
exchange
that
night
ah
you
hurried
me
i
scarce
knew
whether
i
was
clad
or
shod
until
the
next
afternoon
after
i
left
you
at
the
white
house
grounds
so
you
hastily
departed
to
your
wedding
so
small
a
shoe
could
not
have
held
an
extended
epistle
madam
i
said
ignoring
her
question
no
but
the
little
roll
of
paper
caused
me
anguish
after
i
had
danced
i
was
on
the
point
of
fainting
i
hastened
to
the
cover
of
the
nearest
curtain
where
i
might
not
be
noticed
señor
yturrio
of
mexico
was
somewhat
vigilant
he
wished
to
know
what
texas
planned
with
england
he
has
long
made
love
to
me
by
threats
and
jewels
as
i
stood
behind
the
curtain
i
saw
his
face
i
fled
but
one
shoe
the
empty
one
was
not
well
fastened
and
it
fell
i
could
not
walk
i
reached
down
removed
the
other
shoe
with
its
note
hid
it
in
my
handkerchief
thank
providence
for
the
fashion
of
so
much
lace
and
so
not
in
wine
monsieur
as
you
may
believe
and
somewhat
anxious
as
you
may
also
believe
expecting
to
hear
at
once
of
an
encounter
between
van
zandt
and
the
mexican
minister
señor
almonte
or
his
attaché
yturrio
or
between
one
of
them
and
some
one
else
i
made
my
adieux
i
will
warrant
the
only
woman
in
her
stocking
feet
who
bowed
for
tyler
at
the
ball
that
night
yes
so
far
as
i
know
madam
you
are
the
only
lady
who
ever
left
the
east
room
precisely
so
clad
and
so
you
got
into
your
own
carriage
alone
after
a
while
and
so
when
you
were
there
you
put
on
the
shoe
which
was
left
and
so
yturrio
of
mexico
got
the
other
one
and
found
nothing
in
it
and
so
he
wanted
this
one
you
come
on
she
said
you
have
something
more
than
a
trace
of
brain
and
that
other
shoe
which
got
that
night
without
a
word
she
smoothed
out
a
bit
of
paper
which
she
removed
from
a
desk
and
handed
it
to
me
was
in
yours
as
i
said
in
my
confusion
i
supposed
you
had
it
you
said
i
should
go
in
a
sack
i
suppose
i
did
i
suppose
i
lost
my
head
somewhere
but
certainly
i
thought
you
had
found
the
note
and
given
it
to
calhoun
else
i
should
have
driven
harder
terms
with
him
i
would
drive
harder
terms
with
you
now
were
i
not
in
such
haste
to
learn
the
answer
to
my
question
tell
me
you
married
is
that
answer
worth
more
than
van
zandt
i
smiled
yes
she
answered
also
smiling
i
spread
the
page
upon
the
cloth
before
me
my
eyes
raced
down
the
lines
i
did
not
make
further
reply
to
her
madam
went
on
the
communication
say
to
your
august
friend
sir
richard
that
we
have
reached
the
end
of
our
endurance
of
these
late
delays
the
promises
of
the
united
states
mean
nothing
we
can
trust
neither
whig
nor
democrat
any
longer
there
is
no
one
party
in
power
nor
will
there
be
there
are
two
sections
in
america
and
there
is
no
nation
and
texas
knows
not
where
to
go
we
have
offered
to
tyler
to
join
the
union
if
the
union
will
allow
us
to
join
we
intend
to
reserve
our
own
lands
and
reserve
the
right
to
organize
later
into
four
or
more
states
if
our
people
shall
so
desire
but
as
a
great
state
we
will
join
the
union
if
the
union
will
accept
us
that
must
be
seen
england
now
beseeches
us
not
to
enter
the
union
but
to
stand
apart
either
for
independence
or
for
alliance
with
mexico
and
england
the
proposition
has
been
made
to
us
to
divide
into
two
governments
one
free
and
one
slave
england
has
proposed
to
us
to
advance
us
moneys
to
pay
all
our
debts
if
we
will
agree
to
this
settled
by
bold
men
from
our
mother
country
the
republic
texas
has
been
averse
to
this
but
now
our
own
mother
repudiates
us
not
once
but
many
times
we
get
no
decision
this
then
dear
madam
is
from
texas
to
england
by
your
hand
and
we
know
you
will
carry
it
safe
and
secret
we
shall
accept
this
proposal
of
england
and
avail
ourselves
of
the
richness
of
her
generosity
if
within
thirty
days
action
is
not
taken
in
washington
for
the
annexation
of
texas
texas
will
never
in
the
history
of
the
world
be
one
of
the
united
states
moreover
if
the
united
states
shall
lose
texas
also
they
lose
oregon
and
all
of
oregon
carry
this
news
i
am
persuaded
that
it
will
be
welcome
to
that
gentleman
whose
ear
i
know
you
have
and
believe
me
always
my
dear
madam
with
respect
and
admiration
yours
for
the
state
of
texas
van
zandt
i
drew
a
deep
breath
as
i
saw
this
proof
of
double
play
on
the
part
of
this
representative
of
the
republic
of
the
southwest
they
are
traitors
i
exclaimed
but
there
must
be
action
something
must
be
done
at
once
i
must
not
wait
i
must
go
i
must
take
this
at
least
to
mr
calhoun
she
laughed
now
joyously
clapping
her
white
hands
together
good
she
said
you
are
a
man
after
all
you
may
yet
grow
brain
have
i
been
fair
with
you
thus
far
she
asked
at
length
more
than
fair
i
could
not
have
asked
this
of
you
in
an
hour
i
have
learned
the
news
of
years
but
will
you
not
also
tell
me
what
is
the
news
from
château
ramezay
then
indeed
i
could
go
home
feeling
i
had
done
very
much
for
my
chief
monsieur
i
can
not
do
so
you
will
not
tell
me
that
other
news
of
what
of
your
nuptials
madam
i
can
not
do
so
but
for
you
much
as
i
owe
you
i
would
like
to
wring
your
neck
i
would
like
to
take
your
arms
in
my
hands
and
crush
them
until
until
what
her
face
was
strange
i
saw
a
hand
raised
to
her
throat
until
you
told
me
about
oregon
said
i
saw
her
arms
move
just
one
instant
her
body
incline
she
gazed
at
me
steadily
somberly
then
her
hands
fell
ah
god
how
i
hate
you
both
she
said
you
and
her
you
married
after
all
yes
it
can
be
it
can
be
a
woman
may
love
one
man
even
though
he
could
give
her
only
a
bed
of
husks
and
a
man
may
love
a
woman
too
one
woman
i
had
not
known
i
could
only
gaze
at
her
now
more
in
perplexity
than
ever
alike
her
character
and
her
moods
were
beyond
me
what
she
was
or
had
been
i
could
not
guess
only
whatever
she
was
she
was
not
ordinary
that
was
sure
and
was
to
be
classified
under
no
ordinary
rule
woman
or
secret
agent
she
was
and
in
one
or
other
identity
she
could
be
my
friend
or
my
powerful
enemy
could
aid
my
country
powerfully
if
she
had
the
whim
or
damage
it
irreparably
if
she
had
the
desire
but
yes
as
i
studied
her
that
keen
tense
vital
moment
she
was
woman
a
deep
fire
burned
in
her
eyes
that
was
true
but
on
her
face
was
what
it
was
not
rage
it
was
not
passion
it
was
not
chagrin
no
in
truth
and
justice
i
swear
that
what
i
then
saw
on
her
face
was
that
same
look
i
had
noted
once
before
an
expression
of
almost
childish
pathos
of
longing
of
appeal
for
something
missed
or
gone
though
much
desired
no
vanity
could
contemplate
with
pleasure
a
look
like
that
on
the
face
of
a
woman
such
as
helena
von
ritz
i
fancied
her
unstrung
by
excitement
by
the
strain
of
her
trying
labor
by
the
loneliness
of
her
life
uncertain
misunderstood
perhaps
as
it
was
i
wondered
if
she
could
be
more
unhappy
than
i
myself
if
life
could
offer
her
less
than
it
did
to
me
but
i
dared
not
prolong
our
masking
lest
all
should
be
unmasked
it
is
nothing
she
said
at
last
and
laughed
gaily
as
ever
yes
madam
it
is
nothing
i
admit
my
defeat
i
shall
ask
no
more
favors
expect
no
further
information
from
you
for
i
have
not
earned
it
and
i
can
not
pay
i
will
make
no
promise
that
i
could
not
keep
then
we
part
even
as
enemies
or
friends
i
do
not
yet
know
i
can
not
think
for
a
long
time
but
i
too
am
defeated
i
do
not
understand
how
madam
can
be
defeated
in
anything
ah
i
am
defeated
only
because
i
have
won
i
have
your
secret
you
do
not
have
mine
but
i
laid
also
another
wager
with
myself
i
have
lost
it
ceremony
or
not
and
what
does
the
ceremony
value
you
married
i
had
not
known
marriage
to
be
possible
i
had
not
known
you
you
savages
no
so
much
i
had
not

chapter
xvii
a
hunter
of
butterflies
i
love
men
not
because
they
are
men
but
because
they
are
not
there
was
at
that
time
in
montreal
a
sort
of
news
room
and
public
exchange
which
made
a
place
of
general
meeting
it
was
supplied
with
newspapers
and
the
like
and
kept
up
by
subscriptions
of
the
town
merchants
a
spacious
room
made
out
of
the
old
methodist
chapel
on
joseph
street
i
knew
this
for
a
place
of
town
gossip
and
hoped
i
might
hit
upon
something
to
aid
me
in
my
errand
which
was
no
more
than
begun
it
seemed
entering
the
place
shortly
before
noon
i
made
pretense
of
reading
all
the
while
with
an
eye
and
an
ear
out
for
anything
that
might
happen
as
i
stared
in
pretense
at
the
page
before
me
i
fumbled
idly
in
a
pocket
with
unthinking
hand
and
brought
out
to
place
before
me
on
the
table
an
object
of
which
at
first
i
was
unconscious
the
little
indian
blanket
clasp
as
it
lay
before
me
i
felt
seized
of
a
sudden
hatred
for
it
and
let
fall
on
it
a
heavy
hand
as
i
did
so
i
heard
a
voice
at
my
ear
man
do
not
you
break
it
surely
i
started
at
this
i
had
not
heard
any
one
approach
i
discovered
now
that
the
speaker
had
taken
a
seat
near
me
at
the
table
and
could
not
fail
to
see
this
object
which
lay
before
me
i
beg
pardon
he
said
in
a
broken
speech
which
showed
his
foreign
birth
but
it
iss
so
beautiful
to
break
it
iss
wrong
something
in
his
appearance
and
speech
fixed
my
attention
he
was
a
tall
bent
man
perhaps
sixty
years
of
age
of
gray
hair
and
beard
with
the
glasses
and
the
unmistakable
air
of
the
student
his
stooped
shoulders
his
weakened
eye
his
thin
hand
the
hair
standing
like
a
ruff
above
his
forehead
marked
him
not
as
one
acquainted
with
a
wild
life
but
better
fitted
for
other
days
and
scenes
i
pushed
the
trinket
along
the
table
towards
him
is
of
little
value
i
said
and
is
always
in
the
way
when
i
would
find
anything
in
my
pocket
but
once
some
one
hass
made
it
once
it
hass
had
value
tell
me
where
you
get
it
north
of
the
platte
in
our
western
territories
i
said
i
once
traded
in
that
country
you
are
american
yes
so
he
said
thoughtfully
so
a
great
country
a
very
great
country
me
i
also
live
in
it
indeed
i
said
in
what
part
it
iss
five
years
since
i
cross
the
rockies
you
have
crossed
the
rockies
i
envy
you
you
meesunderstand
me
i
live
west
of
them
for
five
years
i
am
now
come
east
all
the
more
then
i
envy
you
you
have
perhaps
seen
the
oregon
country
that
has
always
been
my
dream
my
eye
must
have
kindled
at
that
for
he
smiled
at
me
you
are
like
all
americans
they
leave
their
own
homes
and
make
new
governments
yess
those
men
in
oregon
haf
made
a
new
government
for
themselfs
and
they
tax
those
english
traders
to
pay
for
a
government
which
iss
american
i
studied
him
now
closely
if
he
had
indeed
lived
so
long
in
the
oregon
settlements
he
knew
far
more
about
certain
things
than
i
did
news
travels
slowly
over
so
great
a
distance
said
i
of
course
i
know
nothing
of
these
matters
except
that
last
year
and
the
year
before
the
missionaries
have
come
east
to
ask
us
for
more
settlers
to
come
out
to
oregon
i
presume
they
want
their
churches
filled
but
most
their
said
the
old
man
you
have
been
at
fort
vancouver
he
nodded
also
to
fort
colville
far
north
also
to
what
they
call
california
far
south
and
again
to
what
they
may
yet
call
fort
victoria
i
haf
seen
many
posts
of
the
hudson
bay
company
i
was
afraid
my
eyes
showed
my
interest
but
he
went
on
i
haf
been
in
the
columbia
country
and
in
the
willamette
country
where
most
of
your
americans
are
settled
i
know
somewhat
of
california
howard
of
the
hudson
bay
company
knows
also
of
this
country
of
california
he
said
to
those
english
gentlemans
at
our
meeting
last
night
that
england
should
haf
someting
to
offset
california
on
the
west
coast
because
though
mexico
claims
california
the
yankees
really
rule
there
and
will
rule
there
yet
more
he
iss
right
but
they
laughed
at
him
oh
i
think
little
will
come
of
all
this
talk
i
said
carelessly
it
is
very
far
out
to
oregon
yet
all
the
time
my
heart
was
leaping
so
he
had
been
there
at
that
very
meeting
of
which
i
could
learn
nothing
you
know
not
what
you
say
a
thousand
men
came
into
oregon
last
year
it
iss
like
one
of
the
great
migrations
of
the
peoples
of
asia
of
europe
i
say
to
you
it
iss
a
great
epoch
there
iss
a
such
as
we
haf
not
seen
since
the
days
of
the
huns
the
goths
the
vandals
since
the
cimri
movement
it
iss
an
epoch
my
friend
it
iss
fate
that
iss
in
it
so
then
it
is
a
great
country
i
asked
it
iss
so
great
these
traders
do
not
wish
it
known
they
wish
only
that
it
may
be
savage
also
that
their
posts
and
their
harems
may
be
undisturbed
that
iss
what
they
wish
these
scots
go
wild
again
in
the
wilderness
they
trade
and
they
travel
but
it
iss
not
homes
they
build
sir
george
simpson
wants
steel
traps
and
not
ploughs
west
of
the
rockies
that
iss
all
they
do
not
speak
so
of
doctor
mclaughlin
i
began
tentatively
my
friend
a
great
man
mclaughlin
believe
me
but
he
iss
not
mckay
he
iss
not
simpson
he
iss
not
behrens
he
iss
not
colville
he
iss
not
douglas
and
i
say
to
you
as
i
learned
last
night
you
see
they
asked
me
also
to
tell
what
i
knew
of
oregon
i
say
to
you
that
last
night
mclaughlin
was
deposed
he
iss
in
charge
no
more
so
soon
as
they
can
get
word
to
him
he
loses
his
place
at
vancouver
after
a
lifetime
in
the
service
i
commented
yess
after
a
lifetime
and
mclaughlin
had
brain
and
heart
too
if
england
would
listen
to
him
she
would
learn
sometings
he
plants
he
plows
he
bass
gardens
and
mills
and
houses
and
herds
yess
if
they
let
mclaughlin
alone
they
would
haf
a
civilization
on
the
columbia
and
not
a
post
then
they
could
oppose
your
civilization
there
that
iss
what
he
preaches
simpson
preaches
otherwise
simpson
loses
oregon
to
england
it
may
be
you
know
much
about
affairs
out
in
oregon
i
ventured
again
now
i
did
not
happen
to
be
present
at
the
little
meeting
last
night
i
heard
it
all
he
remarked
carelessly
until
i
went
to
sleep
i
wass
bored
i
care
not
to
hear
of
the
splendor
of
england
then
you
think
there
is
a
chance
of
trouble
between
our
country
and
england
out
there
he
smiled
it
iss
not
a
chance
but
a
certainty
he
said
those
settlers
will
not
gif
up
and
england
is
planning
to
push
them
out
we
had
not
heard
that
i
ventured
it
wass
only
agreed
last
night
england
will
march
this
summer
seven
hundred
men
up
the
peace
river
in
the
fall
they
will
be
across
the
rockies
so
they
can
take
boats
easily
down
the
streams
to
oregon
you
ask
if
there
will
be
troubles
i
tell
you
yess
and
which
wins
my
friend
i
feared
he
would
hear
my
heart
thumping
at
this
news
if
you
stop
where
you
are
england
wins
if
you
keep
on
going
over
the
mountains
england
shall
lose
what
time
can
england
make
with
her
brigades
my
friend
i
asked
him
casually
he
answered
with
gratifying
scientific
precision
from
edmonton
to
fort
colville
west
of
the
rockies
it
hass
been
done
in
six
weeks
and
five
days
by
sir
george
himself
from
fort
colville
down
it
iss
easy
by
boats
it
takes
the
three
months
to
cross
or
four
months
it
would
take
troops
twice
that
long
or
more
for
you
in
the
states
you
can
go
faster
and
ah
my
friend
it
iss
worth
the
race
that
oregon
believe
me
it
iss
full
of
bugs
of
new
bugs
twelve
new
species
i
haf
discovered
and
named
it
iss
sometings
of
honor
iss
it
not
what
you
say
interests
me
very
much
sir
i
said
i
am
only
an
american
trader
knocking
around
to
see
the
world
a
little
bit
you
seem
to
have
been
engaged
in
some
scientific
pursuit
in
that
country
yess
he
said
mein
own
government
and
mein
own
university
they
send
me
to
this
country
to
do
what
hass
not
been
done
i
am
insectologer
shall
i
show
you
my
bugs
of
oregon
you
shall
see
them
yess
come
with
me
to
my
hotel
you
shall
see
many
bugs
such
as
science
hass
not
yet
known
i
was
willing
enough
to
go
with
him
and
true
to
his
word
he
did
show
me
such
quantities
of
carefully
prepared
and
classified
insects
as
i
had
not
dreamed
our
own
country
offered
twelve
new
species
he
said
with
pride
mein
own
country
will
gif
me
honor
for
this
five
years
i
spend
now
i
go
back
home
i
shall
not
tell
you
what
nickname
they
gif
me
in
oregon
he
added
smiling
but
my
real
name
iss
wolfram
von
rittenhofen
berlin
it
wass
last
my
home
tell
me
you
go
soon
to
oregon
that
is
very
possible
i
answered
and
this
time
at
least
i
spoke
the
truth
we
are
bound
in
opposite
directions
but
if
you
are
sailing
for
europe
this
spring
you
would
save
time
and
gain
comfort
by
starting
from
new
york
it
would
give
us
great
pleasure
if
we
could
welcome
so
distinguished
a
scientist
in
washington
no
i
am
not
yet
distinguished
only
shall
i
be
distinguished
when
i
have
shown
my
twelve
new
species
to
mein
own
university
but
it
would
give
me
pleasure
also
to
show
you
washington
you
should
see
also
the
government
of
those
backwoodsmen
who
are
crowding
out
to
oregon
would
you
not
like
to
travel
with
me
in
america
so
far
as
that
he
shook
his
head
doubtfully
perhaps
i
make
mistake
to
come
by
the
lawrence
it
would
be
shorter
to
go
by
new
york
well
i
haf
no
hurry
i
think
it
over
yess
but
tell
me
where
did
you
get
that
leetle
thing
he
asked
me
again
presently
taking
up
in
his
hand
the
indian
clasp
i
traded
for
it
among
the
crow
indians
you
know
what
it
iss
eh
no
except
that
it
is
indian
made
he
scanned
the
round
disks
carefully
wait
he
exclaimed
i
show
you
sometings
he
reached
for
my
pencil
drew
toward
him
a
piece
of
paper
taking
from
his
pocket
meantime
a
bit
of
string
using
the
latter
for
a
radius
he
drew
a
circle
on
the
piece
of
paper
now
look
what
i
do
he
said
as
i
bent
over
curiously
see
i
draw
a
straight
line
through
the
circle
i
divide
it
in
half
so
i
divide
it
in
half
once
more
and
make
a
point
now
i
shorten
my
string
on
each
side
of
my
long
line
i
make
me
a
half
circle
only
half
way
round
on
the
opposite
sides
so
now
what
i
got
eh
you
understand
him
i
shook
my
head
he
pointed
in
turn
to
the
rude
ornamentation
in
the
shell
clasp
i
declare
that
then
i
could
see
a
resemblance
between
the
two
designs
it
is
curious
i
said
it
iss
more
than
curious
it
iss
vonderful
i
haf
two
collected
by
my
own
bands
and
twelve
species
of
my
own
discovery
yess
in
butterflies
alone
that
iss
much
listen
it
iss
notings
iss
the
he
took
a
pace
or
two
excitedly
and
came
back
to
thump
with
his
forefinger
on
the
little
desk
what
you
see
before
you
iss
the
sign
of
the
great
monad
it
iss
known
in
china
in
burmah
in
all
asia
in
all
japan
it
iss
sign
of
the
great
one
of
the
great
two
in
your
hand
iss
the
tah
gook
the
oriental
symbol
for
life
for
sex
myself
i
haf
seen
that
in
sitka
on
chinese
brasses
i
haf
seen
it
on
japanese
signs
in
one
land
and
in
another
land
but
here
you
show
it
to
me
made
by
the
hand
of
some
ignorant
aborigine
of
continent
on
continent
where
it
did
not
originate
and
does
not
belong
it
iss
a
discovery
science
shall
hear
of
it
it
iss
the
link
of
asia
to
america
it
brings
me
fame
he
put
his
hand
into
a
pocket
and
drew
it
out
half
filled
with
gold
pieces
and
with
raw
gold
in
the
form
of
nuggets
as
though
he
would
offer
exchange
i
waved
him
back
no
said
i
you
are
welcome
to
one
of
these
disks
if
you
please
if
you
wish
i
will
take
one
little
bit
of
these
but
tell
me
where
did
you
find
these
pieces
of
raw
gold
those
they
are
notings
i
recollect
me
i
found
these
one
day
up
on
the
rogue
river
not
far
from
my
cabin
i
am
pursuing
a
most
beautiful
moth
such
as
i
haf
not
in
all
my
collection
so
i
fall
on
a
log
i
skin
me
my
leg
in
the
moss
i
find
some
bits
of
rock
i
recollect
me
not
where
but
believe
it
wass
somewhere
there
but
what
i
find
now
here
by
a
stranger
it
iss
worth
more
than
gold
my
friend
i
thank
you
i
embrace
you
i
am
favored
by
fate
to
meet
you
go
with
you
to
washington

chapter

the
missing
slipper
there
will
always
remain
something
to
be
said
of
woman
as
long
as
there
is
one
on
my
new
friend
i
was
glad
to
note
seemed
not
anxious
to
terminate
our
acquaintance
although
in
his
amiable
and
childlike
fashion
he
babbled
of
matters
which
to
me
seemed
unimportant
he
was
eager
to
propound
his
views
on
the
connection
of
the
american
tribes
with
the
peoples
of
the
orient
whereas
i
was
all
for
talking
of
the
connection
of
england
and
the
united
states
with
oregon
thus
we
passed
the
luncheon
hour
at
the
hostelry
of
my
friend
jacques
bertillon
after
which
i
suggested
a
stroll
about
the
town
for
a
time
there
being
that
upon
my
mind
which
left
me
ill
disposed
to
remain
idle
he
agreed
to
my
suggestion
a
fact
for
which
i
soon
was
to
feel
thankful
for
more
reasons
than
one
before
we
started
upon
our
stroll
i
asked
him
to
step
to
my
own
room
where
i
had
left
my
pipe
as
we
paused
here
for
a
moment
he
noticed
on
the
little
commode
a
pair
of
pistols
of
american
make
and
with
a
word
of
apology
took
them
up
to
examine
them
you
also
are
acquainted
with
these
he
asked
politely
it
is
said
that
i
am
i
answered
sometimes
you
need
to
be
he
said
smiling
there
smote
upon
me
even
as
he
spoke
the
feeling
that
his
remark
was
strangely
true
my
eye
fell
on
the
commode
top
casually
i
saw
that
it
now
was
bare
i
recalled
the
strange
warning
of
the
baroness
the
evening
previous
i
was
watched
my
apartment
had
been
entered
in
my
absence
property
of
mine
had
been
taken
my
perturbation
must
have
been
discoverable
in
my
face
what
iss
it
asked
the
old
man
you
forget
someting
no
said
i
stammering
it
is
nothing
he
looked
at
me
dubiously
well
then
i
admitted
i
miss
something
from
my
commode
here
some
one
has
taken
it
it
iss
of
value
perhaps
he
inquired
politely
well
no
not
of
intrinsic
value
was
only
a
slipper
of
white
satin
made
by
braun
of
paris
slipper
of
what
use
it
belonged
to
a
lady
i
was
about
to
return
it
i
said
but
i
fear
my
face
showed
me
none
too
calm
he
broke
out
in
a
gentle
laugh
so
then
we
had
here
the
stage
setting
said
he
the
pistols
the
cause
for
pistols
sometimes
eh
it
is
nothing
i
could
easily
explain
there
iss
not
need
my
young
friend
wass
i
not
also
young
once
yess
once
wass
i
young
he
laid
down
the
pistols
and
i
placed
them
with
my
already
considerable
personal
armament
which
seemed
to
give
him
no
concern
each
man
studies
for
himself
his
own
specialty
mused
the
old
man
you
haf
perhaps
studied
the
species
of
woman
once
also
i
i
laughed
and
shook
my
head
many
species
are
there
he
went
on
many
with
wings
of
gold
and
blue
and
green
of
unknown
colors
creatures
of
air
and
sky
haf
i
not
seen
them
but
always
that
one
species
which
we
pursue
we
do
not
find
once
in
my
life
in
oregon
i
follow
through
the
forest
a
smell
of
sweet
fields
of
flowers
coming
to
me
at
last
i
find
it
a
wide
field
of
flowers
it
wass
in
summer
time
over
the
flowers
were
many
many
butterflies
some
of
them
i
knew
some
of
them
i
had
one
great
new
one
such
as
i
haf
not
seen
it
wass
there
it
rested
shall
now
make
it
mine
i
said
it
iss
fame
to
gif
name
first
to
this
so
noble
a
species
i
would
inclose
it
with
mein
little
net
like
this
you
see
i
creep
up
to
it
as
i
am
about
to
put
it
gently
in
my
net
not
to
harm
it
or
break
it
or
brush
away
the
color
of
its
wings
lo
like
a
puff
of
down
it
rises
and
goes
above
my
head
i
reach
for
it
i
miss
it
rises
still
more
it
flies
it
disappears
so
i
see
it
no
more
it
iss
gone
i
name
it
my
star
of
the
earth
that
which
i
crave
but
do
not
always
haf
eh
believe
me
my
friend
yess
the
study
of
the
species
hass
interest
once
i
wass
young
should
i
see
that
little
shoe
i
think
myself
of
the
time
when
i
wass
young
and
made
studies
mein
gott
also
of
the
species
of
woman
i
too
saw
it
fly
from
me
my
terræ
we
walked
my
friend
still
musing
and
babbling
myself
still
anxious
and
uneasy
we
turned
out
of
narrow
notre
dame
street
and
into
lawrence
main
street
as
we
strolled
i
noted
without
much
interest
the
motley
life
about
me
picturesque
now
with
the
activities
of
the
advancing
spring
presently
however
my
idle
gaze
was
drawn
to
two
young
englishmen
whose
bearing
in
some
way
gave
me
the
impression
that
they
belonged
in
official
or
military
life
although
they
were
in
civilian
garb
presently
the
two
halted
and
separated
the
taller
kept
on
to
the
east
to
the
old
french
town
at
length
i
saw
him
joined
as
though
by
appointment
by
another
gentleman
one
whose
appearance
at
once
gave
me
reason
for
a
second
look
the
severe
air
of
the
canadian
spring
seemed
not
pleasing
to
him
and
he
wore
his
coat
hunched
up
about
his
neck
as
though
he
were
better
used
to
milder
climes
he
accosted
my
young
englishman
and
without
hesitation
the
two
started
off
together
as
they
did
so
i
gave
an
involuntary
exclamation
the
taller
man
i
had
seen
once
before
the
shorter
very
many
times
in
washington
yess
commented
my
old
scientist
calmly
so
strange
they
go
together
ah
you
know
them
i
almost
fell
upon
him
yess
last
night
the
tall
one
iss
peel
a
young
englishman
the
other
is
mexican
they
said
señor
yturrio
of
mexico
he
spoke
much
me
i
wass
sleepy
then
but
also
that
other
tall
one
we
saw
go
back
that
wass
captain
parke
also
of
the
british
navy
his
ship
iss
the
war
boat
a
fine
one
i
see
her
often
when
i
walk
on
the
riffer
front
there
i
turned
to
him
and
made
some
excuse
saying
that
presently
i
would
join
him
again
at
the
hotel
dreamily
as
ever
he
smiled
and
took
his
leave
for
myself
i
walked
on
rapidly
after
the
two
figures
then
a
block
or
so
ahead
of
me
i
saw
them
turn
into
a
street
which
was
familiar
to
myself
they
passed
on
turning
from
time
to
time
among
the
old
houses
of
the
french
quarter
presently
they
entered
the
short
side
street
which
i
myself
had
seen
for
the
first
time
the
previous
night
i
pretended
to
busy
myself
with
my
pipe
as
they
turned
in
at
the
very
gate
which
i
knew
and
knocked
at
the
door
which
i
had
entered
with
my
mysterious
companion
the
door
opened
without
delay
they
both
entered
so
then
helena
von
ritz
had
other
visitors
england
and
mexico
were
indeed
conferring
here
in
montreal
there
were
matters
going
forward
here
in
which
my
government
was
concerned
that
was
evident
i
was
almost
in
touch
with
them
that
also
was
evident
how
then
might
i
gain
yet
closer
touch
at
the
moment
nothing
better
occurred
to
me
than
to
return
to
my
room
and
wait
for
a
time
it
would
serve
no
purpose
for
me
to
disclose
myself
either
in
or
out
of
the
apartments
of
the
baroness
and
it
would
not
aid
me
to
be
seen
idling
about
the
neighborhood
in
a
city
where
there
was
so
much
reason
to
suppose
strangers
were
watched
i
resolved
to
wait
until
the
next
morning
and
to
take
my
friend
von
rittenhofen
with
me
he
need
not
know
all
that
i
knew
yet
in
case
of
any
accident
to
myself
or
any
sudden
contretemps
he
would
serve
both
as
a
witness
and
as
an
excuse
for
disarming
any
suspicion
which
might
be
entertained
regarding
myself
the
next
day
he
readily
enough
fell
in
with
my
suggestion
of
a
morning
stroll
and
again
we
sallied
forth
at
about
nine
having
by
that
time
finished
a
à
la
with
jacques
bertillon
which
to
my
mind
compared
unfavorably
with
one
certain
other
i
had
shared
a
sense
of
uneasiness
began
to
oppress
me
i
knew
not
why
before
i
had
gone
half
way
down
the
little
street
from
the
corner
where
we
turned
it
was
gloomy
and
dismal
enough
at
the
best
and
on
this
morning
an
unusual
apathy
seemed
to
sit
upon
it
for
few
of
the
shutters
were
down
although
the
hour
was
now
here
and
there
a
homely
habitant
appeared
and
bade
us
good
morning
and
once
in
a
while
we
saw
the
face
of
a
good
wife
peering
from
the
window
thus
we
passed
some
dozen
houses
or
so
in
a
row
and
paused
opposite
the
little
gate
i
saw
that
the
shutters
were
closed
or
at
least
all
but
one
or
two
which
were
partly
ajar
something
said
to
me
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
me
to
turn
back
i
might
as
well
have
done
so
we
passed
up
the
little
walk
and
i
raised
the
knocker
at
the
door
but
even
as
it
sounded
i
knew
what
would
happen
there
came
to
me
that
curious
feeling
which
one
experiences
when
one
knocks
at
the
door
of
a
house
which
lacks
human
occupancy
even
more
strongly
i
had
that
strange
feeling
now
because
this
sound
was
not
merely
that
of
unoccupied
rooms
it
came
from
rooms
empty
and
echoing
i
tried
the
door
it
was
not
locked
i
flung
it
wide
and
stepped
within
at
first
i
could
not
adjust
my
eyes
to
the
dimness
absolute
silence
reigned
i
pushed
open
a
shutter
and
looked
about
me
the
rooms
were
not
only
unoccupied
but
unfurnished
the
walls
and
floors
were
utterly
bare
not
a
sign
of
human
occupancy
existed
i
hastened
out
to
the
little
walk
and
looked
up
and
down
the
street
to
satisfy
myself
that
i
had
made
no
mistake
no
this
was
the
number
this
was
the
place
yesterday
these
rooms
were
fitted
sumptuously
as
for
a
princess
now
they
were
naked
not
a
stick
of
the
furniture
existed
nor
was
there
any
trace
either
of
haste
or
deliberation
in
this
removal
what
had
been
simply
was
not
that
was
all
followed
by
my
wondering
companion
i
made
such
inquiry
as
i
could
in
the
little
neighborhood
i
could
learn
nothing
no
one
knew
anything
of
the
occupant
of
these
rooms
no
one
had
heard
any
carts
approach
nor
had
distinguished
any
sounds
during
the
night
sir
said
i
to
my
friend
at
last
i
do
not
understand
it
i
have
pursued
but
it
seems
the
butterfly
has
flown
so
both
silent
myself
morosely
so
we
turned
and
made
our
way
back
across
the
town
half
an
hour
later
we
were
on
the
docks
at
the
river
front
where
we
could
look
out
over
the
varied
shipping
which
lay
there
my
scientific
friend
counted
one
vessel
after
another
and
at
last
pointed
to
a
gap
in
the
line
yesterday
i
wass
here
he
said
and
i
counted
all
the
ships
and
their
names
the
steamer
she
lay
there
now
she
iss
gone
i
pulled
up
suddenly
this
was
the
ship
which
carried
captain
parke
and
his
friend
lieutenant
peel
of
the
british
navy
the
secret
council
at
montreal
was
therefore
apparently
ended
there
would
be
an
english
land
expedition
across
canada
to
oregon
would
there
be
also
an
expedition
by
sea
at
least
my
errand
in
montreal
now
finished
had
not
been
in
vain
even
though
it
ended
in
a
mystery
and
a
query
but
ah
had
i
but
been
less
clumsy
in
that
war
of
wits
with
a
woman
what
might
i
have
learned
had
she
not
been
free
to
mock
me
what
might
i
not
have
learned
she
was
free
to
mock
me
why
because
of
elisabeth
was
it
then
true
that
faith
and
loyalty
could
purchase
alike
faithlessness
and
failure
chapter
xix
the
gentleman
from
tennessee
women
distrust
men
too
much
in
general
and
not
enough
in
now
all
the
more
was
it
necessary
for
me
and
my
friend
from
oregon
to
hasten
on
to
washington
i
say
nothing
further
of
the
arguments
i
employed
with
him
and
nothing
of
our
journey
to
washington
save
that
we
made
it
hastily
as
possible
it
was
now
well
toward
the
middle
of
april
and
brief
as
had
been
my
absence
i
knew
there
had
been
time
for
many
things
to
happen
in
washington
as
well
as
in
montreal
rumors
abounded
i
found
as
soon
as
i
struck
the
first
cities
below
the
canadian
line
it
was
in
the
air
now
that
under
calhoun
there
would
be
put
before
congress
a
distinct
and
definite
attempt
at
the
annexation
of
texas
stories
of
all
sorts
were
on
the
streets
rumors
of
the
wrath
of
clay
yet
other
rumors
of
interesting
possibilities
at
the
coming
whig
and
democratic
conventions
everywhere
was
that
strange
ominous
indescribable
tension
of
the
atmosphere
which
exists
when
a
great
people
is
moved
deeply
the
stern
figure
of
calhoun
furnishing
courage
for
a
people
even
as
he
had
for
a
president
loomed
large
in
the
public
prints
late
as
it
was
when
i
reached
washington
i
did
not
hesitate
to
repair
at
once
to
the
residence
of
calhoun
and
i
took
with
me
as
my
best
adjutant
my
strange
friend
von
rittenhofen
who
i
fancied
might
add
detailed
information
which
calhoun
would
find
of
value
we
were
admitted
to
calhoun
and
after
the
first
greetings
he
signified
that
he
would
hear
my
report
he
sat
his
long
thin
hands
on
his
chair
arm
as
i
went
on
with
my
story
his
keen
eyes
scanning
also
my
old
companion
as
i
spoke
i
explained
what
the
latter
knew
regarding
oregon
i
saw
calhoun
eyes
kindle
as
usual
he
did
not
lack
decision
sir
said
he
to
von
rittenhofen
presently
we
ourselves
are
young
yet
i
trust
not
lacking
in
a
great
nation
interest
in
the
arts
and
sciences
it
occurs
to
me
now
that
in
yourself
we
have
opportunity
to
add
to
our
store
of
knowledge
in
respect
to
certain
biological
features
the
old
gentleman
rose
and
bowed
i
thank
you
for
the
honor
of
your
flattery
sir
he
began
but
calhoun
raised
a
gentle
hand
if
it
would
please
you
sir
to
defer
your
visit
to
your
own
country
for
a
time
i
can
secure
for
you
a
situation
in
our
department
in
biology
where
your
services
would
be
of
extreme
worth
to
us
the
salary
would
also
allow
you
to
continue
your
private
researches
into
the
life
of
our
native
tribes
von
rittenhofen
positively
glowed
at
this
ach
what
an
honor
he
began
again
meantime
resumed
calhoun
not
to
mention
the
value
which
that
research
would
have
for
us
we
could
also
find
use
at
proper
remuneration
for
your
private
aid
in
making
up
a
set
of
maps
of
that
western
country
which
you
know
so
well
and
of
which
even
i
myself
am
so
ignorant
i
want
to
know
the
distances
the
topography
the
means
of
travel
i
want
to
know
the
peculiarities
of
that
country
of
oregon
it
would
take
me
a
year
to
send
a
messenger
for
at
best
it
requires
six
months
to
make
the
outbound
passage
and
in
the
winter
the
mountains
are
impassable
if
you
could
then
take
service
with
us
now
we
should
be
proud
to
make
you
such
return
as
your
scientific
attainments
deserve
few
could
resist
the
persuasiveness
of
calhoun
speech
certainly
not
von
rittenhofen
who
thus
found
offered
him
precisely
what
he
would
have
desired
i
was
pleased
to
see
him
so
happily
situated
and
so
soon
presently
we
despatched
him
down
to
my
hotel
where
i
promised
later
to
make
him
more
at
home
in
his
elation
over
the
prospect
he
now
saw
before
him
the
old
man
fairly
babbled
germany
seemed
farthest
from
his
mind
after
his
departure
calhoun
again
turned
to
me
i
want
you
to
remain
nicholas
said
he
because
i
have
an
appointment
with
a
gentleman
who
will
soon
be
present
rather
a
late
hour
sir
i
ventured
are
you
keeping
faith
with
doctor
ward
i
have
no
time
for
hobbies
he
exclaimed
half
petulantly
what
i
must
do
is
this
work
the
man
we
are
to
meet
is
polk
it
is
important
you
would
not
call
polk
important
i
smiled
frankly
and
calhoun
replied
in
icy
kind
you
can
not
tell
how
large
a
trouble
may
be
started
by
a
small
politician
said
he
at
least
we
will
hear
what
he
has
to
say
was
he
that
sought
the
meeting
not
myself
perhaps
half
an
hour
later
calhoun
old
negro
man
ushered
in
this
awaited
guest
and
we
three
found
ourselves
alone
in
one
of
those
midnight
conclaves
which
went
on
in
washington
even
then
as
they
do
polk
was
serious
as
usual
his
indecisive
features
wearing
the
mask
of
solemnity
which
with
so
many
passed
as
wisdom
i
have
come
calhoun
said
he
when
the
latter
had
assured
him
that
my
presence
would
entail
no
risk
to
him
to
talk
over
this
texas
situation
very
well
said
my
chief
my
own
intentions
regarding
texas
are
now
of
record
precisely
said
polk
now
is
it
wise
to
make
a
definite
answer
in
that
matter
yet
would
it
not
be
better
to
defer
action
until
later
until
after
i
may
say
until
after
you
know
what
your
own
chances
will
be
jim
asked
calhoun
smiling
grimly
why
that
is
it
john
precisely
that
is
it
exactly
now
i
do
know
what
you
think
of
my
chances
in
the
convention
but
i
may
say
that
a
very
large
branch
of
the
western
democracy
is
favoring
me
for
the
nomination
polk
pursed
a
short
upper
lip
and
looked
monstrous
grave
his
extreme
morality
and
his
extreme
dignity
made
his
chief
stock
in
trade
different
from
his
master
old
hickory
he
was
really
at
heart
the
most
aristocratic
of
democrats
and
like
many
another
leader
most
of
his
love
for
the
people
really
was
love
of
himself
yes
i
know
that
some
very
strange
things
happen
in
politics
commented
calhoun
smiling
but
god
bless
me
you
do
call
it
out
of
the
way
for
me
to
seek
the
nomination
one
must
be
president
why
not
myself
now
i
ask
your
support
my
support
is
worth
little
jim
said
my
chief
but
have
you
earned
it
you
have
never
consulted
my
welfare
nor
has
jackson
i
had
no
majority
behind
me
in
the
senate
i
doubt
even
the
house
now
of
what
use
could
i
be
to
you
at
least
you
could
decline
to
do
anything
definite
in
this
texas
matter
why
should
a
man
ever
do
anything
jim
polk
asked
calhoun
bending
on
him
his
frosty
eyes
but
you
may
set
a
fire
going
which
you
can
not
stop
the
people
may
get
out
of
hand
the
convention
why
should
they
not
they
have
interests
as
well
as
we
do
they
not
elect
us
to
subserve
those
interests
i
yield
to
no
man
in
my
disinterested
desire
for
the
welfare
of
the
american
people
began
polk
pompously
throwing
back
the
hair
from
his
forehead
of
course
not
said
calhoun
grimly
my
own
idea
is
that
it
is
well
to
give
the
people
what
is
already
theirs
they
feel
that
texas
belongs
to
them
true
said
the
tennesseean
hesitating
a
good
strong
blast
about
our
martial
spirit
and
the
men
of
the
revolution
that
is
always
good
before
an
election
or
a
convention
very
true
but
now
in
my
own
case
your
own
case
is
not
under
discussion
jim
it
is
the
case
of
the
united
states
i
hold
a
brief
for
them
not
for
you
or
any
other
man
how
do
you
stand
in
case
war
should
be
declared
against
mexico
asked
polk
that
ought
to
be
a
popular
measure
the
texans
have
captured
the
popular
imagination
the
alamo
rankles
in
our
nation
memory
what
would
you
say
to
a
stiff
demand
there
with
a
strong
show
of
military
force
behind
it
i
should
say
nothing
as
to
a
strong
in
any
case
i
should
only
say
that
if
war
came
legitimately
not
otherwise
i
should
back
it
with
all
my
might
i
feel
the
same
in
regard
to
war
with
england
with
england
what
chance
would
we
have
with
so
powerful
a
nation
as
that
there
is
a
god
of
battles
said
john
calhoun
the
chin
of
james
polk
of
tennessee
sank
down
into
his
stock
his
staring
eyes
went
half
shut
he
was
studying
something
in
his
own
mind
at
last
he
spoke
tentatively
as
was
always
his
way
until
he
got
the
drift
of
things
well
now
perhaps
in
the
case
of
england
that
is
good
politics
he
began
it
is
very
possible
that
the
people
hate
england
as
much
as
they
do
mexico
do
you
not
think
so
i
think
they
fear
her
more
but
i
was
only
thinking
of
the
popular
imagination
illustration
forty
or
fight
exclaimed
polk
page
you
are
always
thinking
of
the
popular
imagination
jim
you
have
been
thinking
of
that
for
some
time
in
tennessee
all
that
outcry
about
the
whole
of
oregon
is
forty
or
that
sounds
well
exclaimed
polk
eh
trippingly
on
the
tongue
yes
said
john
calhoun
but
how
would
it
sound
to
the
tune
of
cannon
fire
how
would
it
look
written
in
the
smoke
of
musketry
it
might
not
come
to
that
said
polk
shifting
in
his
seat
i
was
thinking
of
it
only
as
a
rallying
cry
for
the
campaign
dash
me
i
beg
pardon
he
looked
around
to
see
if
there
were
any
methodists
present
but
i
believe
i
could
go
into
the
convention
with
that
war
cry
behind
me
and
sweep
the
boards
of
all
opposition
and
afterwards
but
england
may
back
down
argued
polk
a
strong
showing
in
the
southwest
and
northwest
might
do
wonders
for
us
but
what
would
be
behind
that
strong
showing
mr
polk
demanded
john
calhoun
we
would
win
the
combat
with
mexico
of
course
if
that
iniquitous
measure
should
take
the
form
of
war
but
not
oregon
we
might
as
well
or
better
fight
in
africa
than
oregon
it
is
not
yet
time
in
god
name
jim
polk
be
careful
of
what
you
do
cease
this
cry
of
taking
all
of
oregon
you
will
plunge
this
country
not
into
one
war
but
two
wait
only
wait
and
we
will
own
all
this
continent
to
the
saskatchewan
or
even
farther
north
well
said
the
other
have
you
not
said
there
is
a
god
of
battles
the
lord
god
of
hosts
yes
half
screamed
old
john
calhoun
yes
the
god
of
battles
for
for
but
for
for
the
of
democracy
jim
polk
yes
yes
but
for
the
democratic
or
the
whig
or
for
any
demagogue
who
tries
to
lead
either
no
no
the
florid
face
of
polk
went
livid
sir
said
he
reaching
for
his
hat
at
least
i
have
learned
what
i
came
to
learn
i
know
how
you
will
appear
on
the
floor
of
the
convention
sir
you
will
divide
this
party
hopelessly
you
are
a
traitor
to
the
democratic
party
i
charge
it
to
your
face
here
and
now
i
came
to
ask
of
you
your
support
and
find
you
only
talking
of
principles
sir
tell
me
what
have
to
do
with
john
calhoun
looked
at
him
for
one
long
instant
he
looked
down
then
at
his
own
thin
bloodless
hands
his
wasted
limbs
then
he
turned
slowly
and
rested
his
arms
on
the
table
his
face
resting
in
his
hands
my
god
i
heard
him
groan
to
see
my
chief
abused
was
a
thing
not
in
my
nature
to
endure
i
forgot
myself
i
committed
an
act
whose
results
pursued
me
for
many
a
year
polk
sir
said
i
rising
and
facing
him
damn
you
sir
you
are
not
fit
to
untie
calhoun
shoe
i
will
not
see
you
offer
him
one
word
of
insult
quarrel
with
me
if
you
like
you
will
gain
no
votes
here
now
in
any
case
that
is
sure
utterly
horrified
at
this
polk
fumbled
with
his
hat
and
cane
and
very
red
in
the
face
bowed
himself
out
still
mumbling
calhoun
rising
and
bowing
his
adieux
my
chief
dropped
into
his
chair
again
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
me
directly
nick
said
he
at
length
slowly
you
have
divided
the
democratic
party
you
split
that
party
right
then
and
there
never
i
protested
but
if
i
did
was
ready
enough
for
the
division
let
it
split
then
or
any
party
like
it
if
that
is
what
must
hold
it
together
i
will
not
stay
in
this
work
calhoun
and
hear
you
vilified
platforms
platforms
echoed
my
chief
his
white
hand
dropped
on
the
table
as
he
still
sat
looking
at
me
but
he
will
get
you
some
time
nicholas
he
smiled
jim
polk
will
not
forget
let
him
come
at
me
as
he
likes
i
fumed
at
last
seeing
me
so
wrought
up
calhoun
rose
and
smiling
shook
me
heartily
by
the
hand
of
course
this
had
to
come
one
time
or
another
said
he
the
split
was
in
the
wood
of
their
proposed
platform
of
bluff
and
insincerity
do
the
people
say
asks
jim
polk
do
they
asks
john
calhoun
and
being
now
in
god
providence
chosen
to
do
some
thinking
for
them
i
have
thought
he
turned
to
the
table
and
took
up
a
long
folded
document
which
i
saw
was
done
in
his
cramped
hand
and
with
many
interlineations
copy
this
out
fair
for
me
nicholas
said
he
this
is
our
answer
to
the
aberdeen
note
you
have
already
learned
its
tenor
the
time
we
met
pakenham
with
tyler
at
the
white
house
i
grinned
shall
we
not
take
it
across
direct
to
blair
for
publication
in
his
calhoun
smiled
rather
bitterly
at
this
jest
the
hostility
of
blair
to
the
tyler
administration
was
a
fact
rather
more
than
well
known
all
get
into
polk
newspaper
fast
enough
commented
he
at
last
he
gets
all
the
news
of
the
mexican
ministry
ah
you
think
he
cultivates
the
doña
lucrezia
rather
than
adores
her
i
know
it
of
jim
polk
may
be
human
but
the
other
is
politician
he
will
flatter
that
lady
into
confidences
she
is
well
nigh
distracted
at
best
these
days
what
with
the
fickleness
of
her
husband
and
the
yet
harder
abandonment
by
her
old
admirer
pakenham
so
polk
will
cajole
her
into
disclosures
never
fear
in
return
when
the
time
comes
he
will
send
an
army
of
occupation
into
her
country
and
all
the
while
on
the
one
side
and
the
other
he
will
appear
to
the
public
as
a
moral
and
man
on
whom
neither
man
nor
woman
could
depend
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
the
exasperation
of
his
tone
amused
me
as
did
this
chance
importance
of
what
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
merely
a
petticoat
situation
silk
calhoun
i
grinned
still
silk
and
dimity
my
faith
and
you
he
seemed
a
trifle
nettled
at
this
i
must
take
men
and
women
and
circumstances
as
i
find
them
he
rejoined
and
must
use
such
agencies
as
are
left
me
if
we
temporarily
lack
the
baroness
von
ritz
to
add
zest
to
our
game
i
hazarded
we
still
have
the
doña
lucrezia
and
her
little
jealousies
calhoun
turned
quickly
upon
me
with
a
sharp
glance
as
though
seized
by
some
sudden
thought
by
the
lord
harry
boy
you
give
me
an
idea
wait
now
for
a
moment
do
you
go
on
with
your
copying
there
and
excuse
me
for
a
time
an
instant
later
he
passed
from
the
room
his
tall
figure
bent
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
and
his
face
wrinkled
in
a
frown
as
was
his
wont
when
occupied
with
some
problem
chapter
xx
the
lady
from
mexico
as
soon
as
women
are
ours
we
are
no
longer
theirs
montaigne
after
a
time
my
chief
reëntered
the
office
room
and
bent
over
me
at
my
table
i
put
before
him
the
draft
of
the
document
which
he
had
given
me
for
clerical
care
so
he
said
is
ready
our
declaration
i
wonder
what
may
come
of
that
little
paper
much
will
come
of
it
with
a
strong
people
back
of
it
the
trouble
is
only
that
what
democrat
does
whig
condemns
and
not
even
all
our
party
is
with
tyler
and
yourself
in
this
calhoun
look
for
instance
at
polk
and
his
plans
to
this
venture
on
my
part
he
made
no
present
answer
i
have
no
party
that
is
true
said
he
at
last
none
but
you
and
sam
ward
he
smiled
with
one
of
his
rare
illuminating
smiles
different
from
the
cold
mirth
which
often
marked
him
at
least
calhoun
you
do
not
take
on
your
work
for
the
personal
glory
of
it
said
i
hotly
and
one
day
the
world
will
know
it
matter
very
little
to
me
then
said
he
bitterly
but
come
now
i
want
more
news
about
your
trip
to
montreal
what
have
you
done
so
now
till
far
towards
dawn
of
the
next
day
we
sat
and
talked
i
put
before
him
full
details
of
my
doings
across
the
border
he
sat
silent
his
eye
betimes
wandering
as
though
absorbed
again
fixed
on
me
keen
and
glittering
so
so
he
mused
at
length
when
i
had
finished
england
has
started
a
land
party
for
oregon
can
they
get
across
next
fall
think
you
hardly
possible
sir
said
i
they
could
not
go
so
swiftly
as
the
special
fur
packets
winter
would
catch
them
this
side
of
the
rockies
it
will
be
a
year
before
they
can
reach
oregon
time
for
a
new
president
and
a
new
policy
mused
he
the
grass
is
just
beginning
to
sprout
on
the
plains
calhoun
i
began
eagerly
yes
he
nodded
god
if
i
were
only
young
i
am
young
calhoun
said
i
send
would
you
go
he
asked
suddenly
i
was
going
in
any
case
why
how
do
you
mean
he
demanded
i
felt
the
blood
come
to
my
face
is
all
over
between
miss
elisabeth
churchill
and
myself
said
i
as
calmly
as
i
might
tut
tut
a
child
quarrel
he
went
on
a
child
quarrel
all
mend
in
time
not
by
act
of
mine
then
said
i
hotly
again
abstracted
he
seemed
not
wholly
to
hear
me
first
he
mused
the
more
important
things
riding
over
my
personal
affairs
as
of
little
consequence
i
will
tell
you
nicholas
said
he
at
last
wheeling
swiftly
upon
me
start
next
week
an
army
of
settlers
waits
now
for
a
leader
along
the
missouri
organize
them
lead
them
out
give
them
enthusiasm
tell
them
what
oregon
is
you
may
serve
alike
our
party
and
our
nation
you
can
not
measure
the
consequences
of
prompt
action
sometimes
done
by
a
man
who
is
resolved
upon
the
right
a
thousand
things
may
hinge
on
this
a
great
future
may
hinge
upon
it
it
was
only
later
that
i
was
to
know
the
extreme
closeness
of
his
prophecy
calhoun
began
to
pace
up
and
down
besides
her
land
forces
he
resumed
england
is
despatching
a
fleet
to
the
columbia
i
doubt
not
that
the
has
cleared
for
the
horn
there
may
be
news
waiting
for
you
my
son
when
you
get
across
while
you
have
been
busy
i
have
not
been
idle
he
continued
i
have
here
another
little
paper
which
i
have
roughly
drafted
he
handed
me
the
document
as
he
spoke
a
treaty
with
texas
i
exclaimed
the
first
draft
yes
we
have
signed
the
memorandum
we
await
only
one
other
signature
of
van
zandt
yes
now
comes
nicholas
trist
with
word
of
a
certain
woman
to
the
effect
that
van
zandt
is
playing
also
with
england
and
that
woman
also
is
playing
with
england
calhoun
smiled
enigmatically
but
she
has
gone
said
i
who
knows
where
she
too
may
have
sailed
for
oregon
for
all
we
know
he
looked
at
me
as
though
with
a
flash
of
inspiration
that
may
be
said
he
it
may
very
well
be
that
would
cost
us
our
hold
over
pakenham
neither
would
we
have
any
chance
left
with
her
how
do
you
mean
mr
calhoun
said
i
i
do
not
understand
you
nicholas
said
calhoun
that
lady
was
much
impressed
with
you
he
regarded
me
calmly
contemplatively
appraisingly
i
do
not
understand
you
i
reiterated
i
am
glad
that
you
do
not
and
did
not
in
that
case
all
would
have
been
over
at
once
you
would
never
have
seen
her
a
second
time
your
constancy
was
our
salvation
and
perhaps
your
own
he
smiled
in
a
way
i
liked
none
too
well
but
now
i
began
myself
to
engage
in
certain
reflections
was
it
then
true
that
faith
could
purchase
faith
and
win
not
failure
but
success
at
least
she
has
flown
went
on
calhoun
but
why
what
made
her
go
is
all
over
now
unless
unless
unless
he
added
to
himself
a
third
time
but
unless
what
unless
that
chance
word
may
have
had
some
weight
you
say
that
you
and
she
talked
of
yes
we
went
so
far
into
abstractions
so
did
i
with
her
i
told
her
about
this
country
explained
to
her
as
i
could
the
beauties
of
the
idea
of
a
popular
government
was
as
a
revelation
to
her
she
had
never
known
a
republican
government
before
student
as
she
is
nicholas
your
long
legs
and
my
long
head
may
have
done
some
work
after
all
how
did
she
seem
to
part
with
you
as
though
she
hated
me
as
though
she
hated
herself
and
all
the
world
yet
not
quite
that
either
as
though
she
would
have
wept
that
is
the
truth
i
do
not
pretend
to
understand
her
she
is
a
puzzle
such
as
i
have
never
known
nor
are
you
apt
to
know
another
her
like
look
here
she
is
the
paid
spy
the
secret
agent
of
england
additionally
she
is
intimately
concerned
with
the
private
life
of
pakenham
for
the
love
of
adventure
she
is
engaged
in
intrigue
also
with
mexico
not
content
with
that
born
adventuress
eager
devourer
of
any
hazardous
and
interesting
intellectual
offering
any
puzzle
any
study
any
intrigue
she
comes
at
midnight
to
talk
with
me
whom
she
knows
to
be
the
representative
of
yet
a
third
power
and
finds
you
in
your
red
nightcap
i
laughed
did
she
speak
of
that
asked
calhoun
in
consternation
raising
a
hand
to
his
head
it
may
be
that
i
forgot
but
none
the
less
she
came
yes
as
i
said
she
came
by
virtue
of
your
long
legs
and
your
ready
way
as
i
must
admit
and
you
were
saved
from
her
only
as
i
believe
why
god
bless
elisabeth
churchill
my
boy
that
is
all
but
my
faith
how
nicely
it
all
begins
to
work
out
i
do
not
share
your
enthusiasm
calhoun
said
i
bitterly
on
the
contrary
it
seems
to
me
to
work
out
in
as
bad
a
fashion
as
could
possibly
be
contrived
in
due
time
you
will
see
many
things
more
plainly
meantime
be
sure
england
will
be
careful
she
will
make
no
overt
movement
i
should
say
until
she
has
heard
from
oregon
which
will
not
be
before
my
lady
baroness
shall
have
returned
and
reported
to
pakenham
here
all
of
which
means
more
time
for
us
i
began
to
see
something
of
the
structure
of
bold
enterprise
which
this
man
deliberately
was
planning
but
no
comment
offered
itself
so
that
presently
he
went
on
as
though
in
soliloquy
the
hudson
bay
company
have
deceived
england
splendidly
enough
doctor
mclaughlin
good
man
that
he
is
has
not
suited
the
hudson
bay
company
his
removal
means
less
courtesy
to
our
settlers
in
oregon
granted
a
less
tactful
leader
than
himself
there
will
be
friction
with
our
frontiersmen
in
that
country
no
man
can
tell
when
the
thing
will
come
to
an
issue
for
my
own
part
i
would
agree
with
polk
that
we
ought
to
own
that
country
to
forty
but
what
we
to
do
and
what
we
can
do
are
two
separate
matters
should
we
force
the
issue
now
and
lose
we
would
lose
for
a
hundred
years
should
we
advance
firmly
and
hold
firmly
what
we
gain
in
perhaps
less
than
one
hundred
years
we
may
win
of
that
country
as
i
just
said
to
polk
to
the
river
saskatchewan
i
know
not
where
in
my
own
soul
i
believe
no
man
may
set
a
limit
to
the
growth
of
the
idea
of
an
honest
government
by
the
people
this
continent
is
meant
for
that
honest
government
we
have
already
a
monroe
doctrine
calhoun
said
i
what
you
enunciate
now
is
yet
more
startling
shall
we
call
it
the
calhoun
doctrine
he
made
no
answer
but
arose
and
paced
up
and
down
stroking
the
thin
fringe
of
beard
under
his
chin
still
he
seemed
to
talk
with
himself
we
are
not
rich
he
went
on
our
canals
and
railways
are
young
the
trail
across
our
country
is
of
monstrous
difficulty
give
us
but
a
few
years
more
and
oregon
ripe
as
a
plum
would
drop
in
our
lap
to
hinder
that
is
a
crime
what
polk
proposes
is
insincerity
and
all
insincerity
must
fail
there
is
but
one
result
when
pretense
is
pitted
against
preparedness
ah
if
ever
we
needed
wisdom
and
we
need
them
now
yet
look
at
what
we
face
look
at
what
we
may
lose
and
that
through
party
through
platform
through
he
sighed
as
he
paused
in
his
walk
and
turned
to
me
but
now
as
i
said
we
have
at
least
time
for
texas
and
in
regard
to
texas
we
need
another
woman
i
stared
at
him
you
come
now
to
me
with
proof
that
my
lady
baroness
traffics
with
mexico
as
well
as
england
he
resumed
that
is
to
say
yturrio
meets
my
lady
baroness
what
is
the
inference
at
least
jealousy
on
the
part
of
yturrio
wife
whether
or
not
she
cares
for
him
now
jealousy
between
the
sexes
is
a
deadly
weapon
if
well
handled
repugnant
as
it
is
we
must
handle
it
i
experienced
no
great
enthusiasm
at
the
trend
of
events
and
calhoun
smiled
at
me
cynically
as
he
went
on
i
see
you
do
care
for
this
sort
of
commission
at
least
this
is
no
midnight
interview
you
shall
call
in
broad
daylight
on
the
señora
yturrio
if
you
and
my
daughter
will
take
my
coach
and
four
i
think
she
will
gladly
receive
your
cards
perhaps
also
she
will
consent
to
take
the
air
of
washington
with
you
in
that
case
she
might
drop
in
here
for
an
ice
in
such
case
to
conclude
i
may
perhaps
be
favored
with
an
interview
with
that
lady
i
must
have
van
zandt
signature
to
this
treaty
which
you
see
here
but
these
are
mexicans
and
van
zandt
is
leader
of
the
texans
their
most
bitter
enemies
precisely
all
the
less
reason
why
señora
yturrio
should
be
suspected
i
am
not
sure
that
i
grasp
all
this
mr
calhoun
perhaps
not
you
presently
will
know
more
what
seems
to
me
plain
is
that
since
we
seem
to
lose
a
valuable
ally
in
the
baroness
von
ritz
we
must
make
some
offset
to
that
loss
if
england
has
one
woman
on
the
columbia
we
must
have
another
on
the
rio
grande
chapter
xxi
politics
under
cover
to
a
woman
the
romances
she
makes
are
more
amusing
than
those
she
it
was
curious
how
cleverly
this
austere
old
man
unskilled
in
the
arts
of
gallantry
now
handled
the
problem
to
which
he
had
addressed
himself
even
though
that
meant
forecasting
the
whim
of
yet
another
woman
it
all
came
easily
about
precisely
as
he
had
planned
it
seemed
quite
correct
for
the
daughter
of
our
secretary
of
state
to
call
to
inquire
for
the
health
of
the
fair
señora
yturrio
and
to
present
the
compliments
of
madam
calhoun
at
that
time
not
in
the
city
of
washington
matters
went
so
smoothly
that
i
felt
justified
in
suggesting
a
little
drive
and
señora
yturrio
had
no
hesitation
in
accepting
quite
naturally
our
stately
progress
finally
brought
us
close
to
the
residence
of
miss
calhoun
that
lady
suggested
that
since
the
day
was
warm
it
might
be
well
to
descend
and
see
if
we
might
not
find
a
sherbet
all
of
which
also
seemed
quite
to
the
wish
of
the
lady
from
mexico
the
ease
and
warmth
of
calhoun
greeting
to
her
were
such
that
she
soon
was
well
at
home
and
chatting
very
amiably
she
spoke
english
with
but
little
hesitancy
lucrezia
yturrio
at
that
time
not
ill
known
in
washington
foreign
colony
was
beautiful
in
a
sensuous
ripe
way
her
hair
was
dark
heavily
coiled
and
packed
in
masses
above
an
oval
forehead
her
brows
were
straight
dark
and
delicate
her
teeth
white
and
strong
her
lips
red
and
full
her
chin
well
curved
and
deep
a
round
arm
and
taper
hand
controlled
a
most
artful
fan
she
was
garbed
now
somewhat
splendidly
in
a
corded
silk
wore
gems
enough
to
start
a
shop
and
made
on
the
whole
a
pleasing
picture
of
luxury
and
opulence
she
spoke
in
a
most
musical
voice
with
eyes
sometimes
cast
modestly
down
he
had
been
a
poor
student
of
her
species
who
had
not
ascribed
to
her
a
wit
of
her
own
but
as
i
watched
her
somewhat
apart
i
almost
smiled
as
i
reflected
that
her
grave
and
courteous
host
had
also
a
wit
to
match
it
then
i
almost
frowned
as
i
recalled
my
own
defeat
in
a
somewhat
similar
contest
calhoun
expressed
great
surprise
and
gratification
that
mere
chance
had
enabled
him
to
meet
the
wife
of
a
gentleman
so
distinguished
in
the
diplomatic
service
as
señor
yturrio
the
señora
was
equally
gratified
she
hoped
she
did
not
make
intrusion
in
thus
coming
calhoun
assured
her
that
he
and
his
were
simple
in
their
family
life
and
always
delighted
to
meet
their
friends
we
are
especially
glad
always
to
hear
of
our
friends
from
the
southwest
said
he
at
last
with
a
slight
addition
of
formality
in
tone
and
attitude
at
these
words
i
saw
my
lady
eyes
flicker
it
is
fate
señor
said
she
again
casting
down
her
eyes
and
spreading
out
her
hands
as
in
resignation
fate
which
left
texas
and
mexico
not
always
one
that
may
be
said
calhoun
perhaps
fate
also
that
those
of
kin
should
cling
together
how
can
a
mere
woman
know
my
lady
shrugged
her
very
graceful
and
beautiful
shoulders
somewhat
mature
shoulders
now
but
still
beautiful
dear
señora
said
calhoun
there
are
so
many
things
a
woman
may
not
know
for
instance
how
could
she
know
if
her
husband
should
perchance
leave
the
legation
to
which
he
was
attached
and
pay
a
visit
to
another
nation
again
the
slight
flickering
of
her
eyes
but
again
her
hands
were
outspread
in
protest
how
indeed
señor
what
if
my
young
aide
here
trist
should
tell
you
that
he
has
seen
your
husband
some
hundreds
of
miles
away
and
in
conference
with
a
lady
supposed
to
be
somewhat
friendly
towards
ah
you
mean
that
baroness
so
soon
had
the
shaft
gone
home
her
woman
jealousy
had
offered
a
point
unexpectedly
weak
calhoun
bowed
without
a
smile
upon
his
face
pakenham
the
british
minister
is
disposed
to
be
friendly
to
this
same
lady
your
husband
and
a
certain
officer
of
the
british
navy
called
upon
this
same
lady
last
week
in
montreal
informally
it
is
sometimes
unfortunate
that
plans
are
divulged
to
me
it
seemed
only
wise
and
fit
that
you
should
not
let
any
of
these
little
personal
matters
make
for
us
greater
complications
in
these
perilous
times
i
think
you
understand
me
perhaps
señora
yturrio
she
gurgled
low
in
her
throat
at
this
any
sort
of
sound
meaning
to
remain
ambiguous
but
calhoun
was
merciless
it
is
not
within
dignity
señora
for
me
to
make
trouble
between
a
lady
and
her
husband
but
we
must
have
friends
with
us
under
our
flag
or
know
that
they
are
not
our
friends
you
are
welcome
in
my
house
your
husband
is
welcome
in
the
house
of
our
republic
there
are
certain
duties
even
thus
only
now
and
again
she
turned
upon
him
the
light
of
her
splendid
eyes
searching
him
if
i
should
recall
again
gently
my
dear
señora
the
fact
that
your
husband
was
with
that
particular
woman
if
i
should
say
that
mexico
has
been
found
under
the
flag
of
england
while
supposed
to
be
under
flag
if
i
should
add
that
one
of
the
representatives
of
the
mexican
legation
had
been
discovered
in
handing
over
to
england
certain
secrets
of
this
country
and
of
the
republic
of
texas
why
then
what
answer
think
you
señora
mexico
would
make
to
me
but
señor
calhoun
does
not
mean
does
not
dare
to
say
i
do
dare
it
i
do
mean
it
i
can
tell
you
all
that
mexico
plans
and
all
that
texas
plans
all
the
secrets
are
out
and
since
we
know
them
we
purpose
immediate
annexation
of
the
republic
of
texas
though
it
means
war
texas
shall
be
ours
this
has
been
forced
upon
us
by
the
perfidy
of
other
nations
he
looked
her
full
in
the
eye
his
own
blue
orbs
alight
with
resolution
she
returned
his
gaze
fierce
as
a
tigress
but
at
last
she
spread
out
her
deprecating
hands
señor
she
said
i
am
but
a
woman
i
am
in
the
señor
hands
i
am
even
in
his
what
can
he
wish
in
no
unfair
way
señora
i
beg
you
to
understand
in
no
improper
way
are
you
in
our
hands
but
now
let
us
endeavor
to
discover
some
way
in
which
some
of
these
matters
may
be
composed
in
such
affairs
a
small
incident
is
sometimes
magnified
and
taken
in
connection
with
its
possible
consequences
you
readily
may
see
señora
that
did
i
personally
seek
the
dismissal
of
your
husband
possibly
even
the
recall
of
general
almonte
his
chief
that
might
be
effected
without
difficulty
you
seek
war
señor
secretary
my
people
say
that
your
armies
are
in
texas
now
or
will
be
they
are
but
very
slightly
in
advance
of
the
truth
señora
said
calhoun
grimly
for
me
i
do
not
believe
in
war
when
war
can
be
averted
but
suppose
it
be
averted
suppose
the
señora
yturrio
herself
avert
it
suppose
the
señora
could
remain
here
still
in
this
city
which
she
so
much
admires
a
lady
of
so
distinguished
beauty
and
charm
is
valuable
in
our
society
here
he
bowed
to
her
with
stately
grace
if
there
was
mockery
in
his
tone
she
could
not
catch
it
nor
did
her
searching
eyes
read
his
meaning
see
he
resumed
alone
i
am
helpless
in
this
situation
if
my
government
is
offended
i
can
not
stop
the
course
of
events
i
am
not
the
senate
i
am
simply
an
officer
in
our
administration
a
very
humble
officer
of
his
excellency
our
president
mr
tyler
my
lady
broke
out
in
a
peal
of
low
rippling
laughter
her
white
teeth
gleaming
it
was
after
all
somewhat
difficult
to
trifle
with
one
who
had
been
trained
in
intrigue
all
her
life
calhoun
laughed
now
in
his
own
quiet
way
we
shall
do
better
if
we
deal
entirely
frankly
señora
said
he
let
us
then
waste
no
time
frankly
then
it
would
seem
that
now
the
baroness
von
ritz
is
off
the
scene
the
señora
yturrio
would
have
all
the
better
title
and
opportunity
in
the
affections
of
well
let
us
say
her
own
husband
she
bent
toward
him
now
her
lips
open
in
a
slow
smile
all
her
subtle
and
dangerous
beauty
unmasking
its
batteries
the
impression
she
conveyed
was
that
of
warmth
and
of
spotted
shadows
such
as
play
upon
the
leopard
back
such
as
mark
the
wing
of
the
butterfly
the
petal
of
some
flower
born
in
a
land
of
heat
and
passion
but
calhoun
regarded
her
calmly
his
finger
tips
together
and
spoke
as
deliberately
as
though
communing
with
himself
it
is
but
one
thing
one
very
little
thing
and
what
is
that
señor
she
asked
at
length
the
signature
of
señor
van
zandt
attaché
for
texas
on
this
memorandum
of
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
texas
bowing
he
presented
to
her
the
document
to
which
he
had
earlier
directed
my
own
attention
we
are
well
advised
that
señor
van
zandt
is
trafficking
this
very
hour
with
england
as
against
us
he
explained
we
ask
the
gracious
assistance
of
señora
yturrio
in
return
we
promise
her
silence
i
can
not
it
is
impossible
she
exclaimed
as
she
glanced
at
the
pages
it
is
our
ruin
no
señora
said
calhoun
sternly
it
means
annexation
of
texas
to
the
united
states
but
that
is
not
your
ruin
it
is
your
salvation
your
country
well
may
doubt
england
even
england
bearing
gifts
i
have
no
control
over
señor
van
zandt
he
is
the
enemy
of
my
country
she
began
calhoun
now
fixed
upon
her
the
full
cold
blue
blaze
of
his
singularly
penetrating
eyes
no
señora
he
said
sternly
but
you
have
access
to
my
friend
polk
and
polk
is
the
friend
of
jackson
and
they
two
are
friends
of
van
zandt
and
texas
supposes
that
these
two
although
they
do
not
represent
precisely
my
own
beliefs
in
politics
are
for
the
annexation
of
texas
not
to
england
but
to
america
there
is
good
chance
polk
may
be
president
if
you
do
not
use
your
personal
influence
with
him
he
may
consult
politics
and
not
you
and
so
declare
war
against
mexico
that
war
would
cost
you
texas
and
much
more
as
well
now
to
avert
that
war
do
you
not
think
that
perhaps
you
can
ask
polk
to
say
to
van
zandt
that
his
signature
on
this
little
treaty
would
end
all
such
questions
simply
immediately
and
to
the
best
benefit
of
mexico
texas
and
the
united
states
treason
why
señora
be
preventing
treason
her
face
was
half
hidden
by
her
fan
and
her
eyes
covered
by
their
deep
lids
gave
no
sign
of
her
thoughts
the
same
cold
voice
went
on
you
might
for
instance
tell
polk
which
is
to
say
van
zandt
that
if
his
name
goes
on
this
little
treaty
for
texas
nothing
will
be
said
to
texas
regarding
his
proposal
to
give
texas
over
to
england
it
might
not
be
safe
for
that
little
fact
generally
to
be
known
in
texas
as
it
is
known
to
me
we
will
keep
it
secret
you
might
ask
van
zandt
if
he
would
value
a
seat
in
the
senate
of
these
united
states
rather
than
a
lynching
rope
so
much
do
i
value
your
honorable
acquaintance
with
polk
and
with
van
zandt
my
dear
lady
that
i
do
not
go
to
the
latter
and
his
signature
in
the
name
of
his
republic
no
i
merely
suggest
to
you
that
did
take
this
little
treaty
for
a
day
and
presently
return
it
to
me
with
his
signature
attached
i
should
feel
so
deeply
gratified
that
i
should
not
ask
you
by
what
means
you
had
attained
this
most
desirable
result
and
i
should
hope
that
if
you
could
not
win
back
the
affections
of
a
certain
gentleman
at
least
you
might
win
your
own
evening
of
the
scales
with
him
her
face
colored
darkly
in
a
flash
she
saw
the
covert
allusion
to
the
faithless
pakenham
here
was
the
chance
to
cut
him
to
the
soul
could
cost
england
texas
revenge
made
its
swift
appeal
to
her
savage
heart
revenge
and
jealousy
handled
coolly
mercilessly
as
weapons
those
cost
england
texas
she
sat
her
fan
tight
at
her
white
teeth
it
would
be
death
to
me
if
it
were
known
she
said
but
still
she
pondered
her
eye
alight
with
somber
fire
her
dark
cheek
red
in
a
woman
anger
but
it
never
will
be
known
my
dear
lady
these
things
however
must
be
concluded
swiftly
we
have
not
time
to
wait
let
us
not
argue
over
the
unhappy
business
let
me
think
of
mexico
as
our
sister
republic
and
our
friend
and
suppose
i
shall
not
do
this
that
you
ask
señor
that
my
dear
lady
do
not
suppose
you
threaten
señor
secretary
on
the
contrary
i
implore
i
ask
you
not
to
be
treasonable
to
any
but
to
be
our
ally
our
friend
in
what
in
my
soul
i
believe
a
great
good
for
the
peoples
of
the
world
without
us
texas
will
be
the
prey
of
england
with
us
she
will
be
working
out
her
destiny
in
our
graveyard
of
state
there
are
many
secrets
of
which
the
public
never
knows
here
shall
be
one
though
your
heart
shall
exult
in
its
possession
dear
lady
may
we
not
conspire
together
for
the
ultimate
good
of
three
republics
making
of
them
two
noble
ones
later
to
dwell
in
amity
shall
we
not
hope
to
see
all
this
continent
swept
free
of
monarchy
held
for
the
peoples
of
the
world
for
an
instant
no
more
she
sat
and
pondered
suddenly
she
bestowed
upon
him
a
smile
whose
brilliance
might
have
turned
the
head
of
another
man
rising
she
swept
him
a
curtsey
whose
grace
i
have
not
seen
surpassed
in
return
calhoun
bowed
to
her
with
dignity
and
ease
and
lifting
her
hand
pressed
it
to
his
lips
then
offering
her
an
arm
he
led
her
to
his
carriage
i
could
scarce
believe
my
eyes
and
ears
that
so
much
and
of
so
much
importance
had
thus
so
easily
been
accomplished
where
all
had
seemed
so
near
to
the
impossible
when
last
i
saw
my
chief
that
day
he
was
sunk
in
his
chair
white
to
the
lips
his
long
hands
trembling
fatigue
written
all
over
his
face
and
form
but
a
smile
still
was
on
his
grim
mouth
nicholas
said
he
had
i
fewer
politicians
and
more
women
behind
me
we
should
have
texas
to
the
rio
grande
and
oregon
up
to
russia
and
all
without
a
war
chapter
xxii
but
yet
a
woman
woman
turns
every
man
the
wrong
side
out
and
never
gives
to
truth
and
virtue
that
which
simpleness
and
merit
purchaseth
my
chief
played
his
game
of
chess
coldly
methodically
and
with
skill
yet
a
game
of
chess
is
not
always
of
interest
to
the
spectator
who
does
not
know
every
move
least
of
all
does
it
interest
one
who
feels
himself
but
a
pawn
piece
on
the
board
and
part
of
a
plan
in
whose
direction
he
has
nothing
to
say
in
truth
i
was
weary
not
even
the
contemplation
of
the
hazardous
journey
to
oregon
served
to
stir
me
i
traveled
wearily
again
and
again
my
circle
of
personal
despair
on
the
day
following
my
last
interview
with
calhoun
i
had
agreed
to
take
my
old
friend
doctor
von
rittenhofen
upon
a
short
journey
among
the
points
of
interest
of
our
city
in
order
to
acquaint
him
somewhat
with
our
governmental
machinery
and
to
put
him
in
touch
with
some
of
the
sources
of
information
to
which
he
would
need
to
refer
in
the
work
upon
which
he
was
now
engaged
we
had
spent
a
couple
of
hours
together
and
were
passing
across
to
the
capitol
with
the
intent
of
looking
in
upon
the
deliberations
of
the
houses
of
congress
when
all
at
once
as
we
crossed
the
corridor
i
felt
him
touch
my
arm
did
you
see
that
young
lady
he
asked
of
me
she
looked
at
you
yess
i
was
in
the
act
of
turning
even
as
he
spoke
certainly
had
i
been
alone
i
would
have
seen
elisabeth
would
have
known
that
she
was
there
it
was
elisabeth
alone
and
hurrying
away
already
she
was
approaching
the
first
stair
in
a
moment
she
would
be
gone
i
sprang
after
her
by
instinct
without
plan
clear
in
my
mind
only
that
she
was
going
and
with
her
all
the
light
of
the
world
that
she
was
going
and
that
she
was
beautiful
adorable
that
she
was
going
and
that
she
was
elisabeth
as
i
took
a
few
rapid
steps
toward
her
i
had
full
opportunity
to
see
that
no
grief
had
preyed
upon
her
comeliness
nor
had
concealment
fed
upon
her
damask
cheek
almost
with
some
resentment
i
saw
that
she
had
never
seemed
more
beautiful
than
on
this
morning
the
costume
of
those
days
was
trying
to
any
but
a
beautiful
woman
yet
elisabeth
had
a
way
of
avoiding
extremes
which
did
not
appeal
to
her
individual
taste
her
frock
now
was
all
in
pink
as
became
the
gentle
spring
and
the
bunch
of
silvery
ribbons
which
fluttered
at
her
belt
had
quite
the
agreeing
shade
to
finish
in
perfection
the
cool
sweet
picture
that
she
made
her
sleeves
were
puffed
widely
and
for
the
lower
arm
were
opened
just
sufficiently
she
carried
a
small
white
parasol
with
pinked
edges
and
her
silken
mitts
light
and
dainty
matched
the
clear
whiteness
of
her
arms
her
face
turned
away
from
me
was
shaded
by
a
wide
round
bonnet
not
quite
so
painfully
plain
as
the
scooplike
affair
of
the
time
but
with
a
drooping
brim
from
which
depended
a
slight
frilling
of
sheer
lace
her
smooth
brown
hair
was
drawn
primly
down
across
her
ears
as
was
the
fashion
of
the
day
and
from
the
masses
piled
under
the
bonnet
brim
there
fell
down
a
curl
round
as
though
made
that
moment
and
not
yet
limp
from
the
damp
heat
of
washington
fresh
and
dainty
and
restful
as
a
picture
done
on
dresden
yet
strong
fresh
fully
competent
elisabeth
walked
as
having
full
right
in
the
world
and
accepting
as
her
due
such
admiration
as
might
be
offered
if
she
had
ever
known
a
care
she
did
not
show
it
and
i
say
this
made
me
feel
resentment
it
was
her
proper
business
to
appear
miserable
if
she
indeed
resembled
a
rare
piece
of
flawless
dresden
on
this
morning
she
was
as
cold
her
features
were
as
unmarked
by
any
human
pity
ah
so
different
an
elisabeth
this
from
the
one
i
had
last
seen
at
the
east
room
with
throat
fluttering
and
cheeks
far
warmer
than
this
cool
rose
pink
but
changed
or
not
the
full
sight
of
her
came
as
the
sudden
influence
of
some
powerful
drug
blotting
out
consciousness
of
other
things
i
could
no
more
have
refrained
from
approaching
her
than
i
could
have
cast
away
my
own
natural
self
and
form
just
as
she
reached
the
top
of
the
broad
marble
stairs
i
spoke
elisabeth
seeing
that
there
was
no
escape
she
paused
now
and
turned
toward
me
i
have
never
seen
a
glance
like
hers
say
not
there
is
no
language
of
the
eyes
no
speech
in
the
composure
of
the
features
yet
such
is
the
sphinx
power
given
to
woman
that
now
i
saw
as
though
it
were
a
thing
tangible
a
veil
drawn
across
her
eyes
across
her
face
between
her
soul
and
mine
elisabeth
drew
herself
up
straight
her
chin
high
her
eyes
level
her
lips
just
parted
for
a
faint
salutation
in
the
conventions
of
the
morning
how
do
you
do
she
remarked
her
voice
was
all
cool
white
enamel
then
that
veil
dropped
down
between
us
she
was
there
somewhere
but
i
could
not
see
her
clearly
now
it
was
not
her
voice
i
took
her
hand
yes
but
it
had
now
none
of
answering
clasp
the
flush
was
on
her
cheek
no
more
cool
pale
sweet
all
white
now
armed
with
indifference
she
looked
at
me
as
formally
as
though
i
were
a
remote
acquaintance
then
she
would
have
passed
elisabeth
i
began
i
am
just
back
i
have
not
had
time
i
have
had
no
leave
from
you
to
come
to
see
you
to
ask
you
to
explain
explain
she
said
evenly
but
surely
you
can
not
believe
that
i
i
only
believe
what
seems
credible
mr
trist
but
you
promised
that
very
morning
you
agreed
were
you
out
of
your
mind
that
i
was
out
of
my
mind
that
morning
but
not
that
evening
now
she
was
patrician
superior
suddenly
i
became
conscious
of
the
dullness
of
my
own
garb
i
cast
a
quick
glance
over
my
figure
to
see
whether
it
had
not
shrunken
but
that
is
not
it
elisabeth
a
girl
may
not
allow
a
man
so
much
as
you
promised
me
and
then
forget
that
promise
in
a
day
it
a
promise
between
us
agreed
that
i
should
come
i
did
come
you
had
given
your
word
i
say
was
that
the
way
to
treat
me
coming
as
i
did
i
found
it
possible
said
she
but
if
you
please
i
must
go
i
beg
your
pardon
but
my
aunt
betty
is
waiting
with
the
carriage
why
damn
aunt
betty
i
exclaimed
you
shall
not
go
see
look
here
i
pulled
from
my
pocket
the
little
ring
which
i
had
had
with
me
that
night
when
i
drove
out
to
elmhurst
in
my
carriage
the
one
with
the
single
gem
which
i
had
obtained
hurriedly
that
afternoon
having
never
before
that
day
had
the
right
to
do
so
in
another
pocket
i
found
the
plain
gold
one
which
should
have
gone
with
the
gem
ring
that
same
evening
my
hand
trembled
as
i
held
these
out
to
her
i
prove
to
you
what
i
meant
here
i
had
no
time
why
elisabeth
i
was
hurrying
i
was
mad
i
had
a
right
to
offer
you
these
things
i
have
still
the
right
to
ask
you
why
you
did
not
take
them
will
you
not
take
them
now
she
put
my
hand
away
from
her
gently
keep
them
she
said
for
the
owner
of
that
other
wedding
gift
the
one
which
i
received
now
i
broke
out
good
god
how
can
i
be
held
to
blame
for
the
act
of
a
drunken
friend
you
know
jack
dandridge
as
well
as
i
do
myself
i
cautioned
him
i
was
not
responsible
for
his
condition
it
was
not
that
decided
me
you
could
not
believe
it
was
who
sent
you
that
accursed
shoe
which
belonged
to
another
woman
he
said
it
came
from
you
where
did
get
it
then
now
as
readily
may
be
seen
i
was
obliged
again
to
hesitate
there
were
good
reasons
to
keep
my
lips
sealed
i
flushed
the
red
of
confusion
which
came
to
my
cheek
was
matched
by
that
of
indignation
in
her
own
i
could
not
tell
her
and
she
could
not
understand
that
my
work
for
calhoun
with
that
other
woman
was
work
for
america
and
so
as
sacred
and
as
secret
as
my
own
love
for
her
innocent
i
still
seemed
guilty
so
then
you
do
not
say
i
do
not
ask
you
i
do
not
deny
it
you
do
not
care
to
tell
me
where
you
got
it
no
said
i
i
will
not
tell
you
where
i
got
it
why
because
that
would
involve
another
woman
another
woman
do
you
think
then
that
on
this
one
day
of
her
life
a
girl
likes
to
think
of
her
her
lover
as
involved
with
any
other
woman
ah
you
made
me
begin
to
think
i
could
not
help
the
chill
that
came
on
my
heart
marry
you
i
could
not
i
never
could
now
yet
you
had
decided
you
had
told
me
it
was
agreed
i
had
decided
on
facts
as
i
thought
they
were
other
facts
came
before
you
arrived
sir
you
do
me
a
very
great
compliment
but
you
loved
me
once
i
said
banally
i
do
not
consider
it
fair
to
mention
that
now
i
never
loved
that
other
woman
i
had
never
seen
her
more
than
once
you
do
not
know
her
ah
is
that
it
perhaps
i
could
tell
you
something
of
one
helena
von
ritz
is
it
not
so
yes
that
was
the
property
of
helena
von
ritz
i
told
her
looking
her
fairly
in
the
eye
kind
of
you
indeed
to
involve
me
as
you
say
with
a
lady
of
her
precedents
now
her
color
was
up
full
and
her
words
came
crisply
had
i
had
adequate
knowledge
of
women
i
could
have
urged
her
on
then
and
brought
on
a
quarrel
strategically
that
must
have
been
a
far
happier
condition
than
mere
indifference
on
her
part
but
i
did
not
know
and
my
accursed
love
of
fairness
blinded
me
i
hardly
think
any
one
is
quite
just
to
that
lady
said
i
slowly
except
nicholas
trist
a
beautiful
and
accomplished
lady
i
doubt
not
in
his
mind
yes
all
of
that
i
doubt
not
and
quite
kind
with
her
little
gifts
elisabeth
i
can
not
well
explain
all
that
to
you
i
can
not
on
my
honor
do
not
she
cried
putting
out
her
hand
as
though
in
alarm
do
not
invoke
your
honor
she
looked
at
me
again
i
have
never
seen
a
look
like
hers
she
had
been
calm
cold
and
again
indignant
all
in
a
moment
time
that
expression
which
now
showed
on
her
face
was
one
yet
worse
for
me
still
i
would
not
accept
my
dismissal
but
went
on
stubbornly
but
may
i
not
see
your
father
and
have
my
chance
again
i
let
it
go
this
way
it
is
the
ruin
of
my
life
but
now
she
was
advancing
dropping
down
a
step
at
a
time
and
her
face
was
turned
straight
ahead
the
pink
of
her
gown
was
matched
by
the
pink
of
her
cheeks
i
saw
the
little
working
of
the
white
throat
wherein
some
sobs
seemed
stifling
and
so
she
went
away
and
left
me
chapter

success
in
silk
as
things
are
i
think
women
are
generally
better
creatures
than
it
was
a
part
of
my
duties
when
in
washington
to
assist
my
chief
in
his
personal
and
official
correspondence
which
necessarily
was
very
heavy
this
work
we
customarily
began
about
nine
of
the
morning
on
the
following
day
i
was
on
hand
earlier
than
usual
i
was
done
with
washington
now
done
with
everything
eager
only
to
be
off
on
the
far
trails
once
more
but
i
almost
forgot
my
own
griefs
when
i
saw
my
chief
when
i
found
him
already
astir
in
his
office
his
face
was
strangely
wan
and
thin
his
hands
bloodless
over
him
hung
an
air
of
utter
weariness
yet
shame
to
my
own
despair
energy
showed
in
all
his
actions
resolution
was
written
on
his
face
he
greeted
me
with
a
smile
which
strangely
lighted
his
grim
face
we
have
good
news
of
some
kind
this
morning
sir
i
inquired
in
answer
he
motioned
me
to
a
document
which
lay
open
upon
his
table
it
was
familiar
enough
to
me
i
glanced
at
the
bottom
there
were
signatures
texas
agrees
i
exclaimed
doña
lucrezia
has
won
van
signature
i
looked
at
him
his
own
eyes
were
swimming
wet
this
then
was
that
man
of
whom
it
is
only
remembered
that
he
was
a
champion
it
will
be
a
great
country
said
he
at
last
this
once
done
i
shall
feel
that
after
all
i
have
not
lived
wholly
in
vain
but
the
difficulties
suppose
van
zandt
proves
traitorous
to
us
he
dare
not
texas
may
know
that
he
bargained
with
england
but
he
dare
not
traffic
with
mexico
and
let
be
known
he
would
not
live
a
day
but
perhaps
the
doña
lucrezia
herself
might
some
time
prove
fickle
dare
not
she
never
will
she
will
enjoy
in
secret
her
revenge
on
perfidious
albion
which
is
to
say
perfidious
pakenham
her
nature
is
absolutely
different
from
that
of
the
baroness
von
ritz
the
doña
lucrezia
dreams
of
the
torch
of
love
not
the
torch
of
principle
the
public
might
not
approve
calhoun
but
at
least
there
advantages
in
this
sort
of
aids
we
are
obliged
to
find
such
help
as
we
can
the
public
is
not
always
able
to
tell
which
was
plot
and
which
counterplot
in
the
accomplishment
of
some
intricate
things
the
result
excuses
all
it
was
written
that
texas
should
come
to
this
country
now
for
oregon
it
grows
this
idea
of
democracy
at
least
sir
you
will
have
done
your
part
only
now
only
what
then
we
are
certain
to
encounter
opposition
the
senate
may
not
ratify
this
texas
treaty
the
senate
will
ratify
said
he
i
am
perfectly
well
advised
of
how
the
vote
will
be
when
this
treaty
comes
before
it
for
ratification
we
will
be
beaten
two
to
one
then
does
that
not
end
it
end
it
no
there
are
always
other
ways
if
the
people
of
this
country
wish
texas
to
belong
to
our
flag
she
will
so
belong
it
is
as
good
as
done
never
look
at
the
obstacles
look
at
the
goal
it
was
this
intrigue
of
van
zandt
which
stood
in
our
way
by
playing
one
intrigue
against
another
we
have
won
thus
far
we
must
go
on
winning
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
one
hand
smiting
the
other
let
england
whistle
now
he
exclaimed
exultantly
we
shall
annex
texas
in
full
view
indeed
of
all
possible
consequences
there
can
be
no
consequences
for
england
has
no
excuse
left
for
war
over
texas
i
only
wish
the
situation
were
as
clear
for
oregon
there
be
bad
news
for
our
friend
señor
yturrio
when
he
gets
back
to
his
own
legation
i
ventured
let
him
then
face
that
day
when
mexico
shall
see
fit
to
look
to
us
for
aid
and
counsel
we
will
build
a
mighty
country
on
continent
pakenham
is
accredited
to
have
certain
influence
in
our
senate
yes
we
have
his
influence
exactly
weighed
yet
i
rejoice
in
at
least
one
thing
one
of
his
best
allies
is
not
here
you
mean
señor
yturrio
i
mean
the
baroness
von
ritz
and
now
comes
on
that
next
nominating
convention
at
baltimore
what
will
it
do
i
hesitated
god
knows
for
me
i
have
no
party
i
am
alone
i
have
but
few
friends
in
all
the
world
he
smiled
now
you
my
boy
as
i
said
and
doctor
ward
and
a
few
women
all
of
whom
hate
each
other
i
remained
silent
at
this
shot
which
came
home
to
me
but
he
smiled
still
grimly
shaking
his
head
rustle
of
silk
my
boy
rustle
of
silk
it
is
over
all
our
maps
but
we
shall
make
these
maps
time
shall
bear
me
witness
then
i
may
start
soon
for
oregon
i
demanded
you
shall
start
he
answered
chapter
xxiv
the
trail
there
are
no
pleasures
where
women
are
not
marie
de
romba
how
shall
i
tell
of
those
stirring
times
in
such
way
that
readers
who
live
in
later
and
different
days
may
catch
in
full
their
flavor
how
shall
i
write
now
so
that
at
a
later
time
men
may
read
of
the
way
america
was
taken
may
see
what
america
then
was
and
now
is
and
what
yet
please
god
it
may
be
how
shall
be
set
down
that
keen
zest
of
a
nation
youth
full
of
ambition
and
daring
full
of
contempt
for
obstacles
full
of
a
vast
and
splendid
hope
how
shall
be
made
plain
also
that
other
and
stronger
thing
which
so
many
of
those
days
have
mentioned
to
me
half
in
reticence
that
feeling
that
after
all
this
fever
of
the
blood
this
imperious
insistence
upon
new
lands
had
under
it
something
more
than
human
selfishness
i
say
i
wish
that
some
tongue
or
brush
or
pen
might
tell
the
story
of
our
people
at
that
time
once
i
saw
it
in
part
told
in
color
and
line
in
a
painting
done
by
a
master
hand
almost
one
fit
to
record
the
spirit
of
that
day
although
it
wrought
in
this
instance
with
another
and
yet
earlier
time
in
this
old
canvas
depicting
an
early
teutonic
tribal
wandering
appeared
some
scores
of
human
figures
men
and
women
half
savage
in
their
look
clad
in
skins
with
fillets
of
hide
for
head
covering
men
whose
beards
were
strong
and
large
whose
limbs
wrapped
loose
in
hides
were
strong
and
large
women
strong
and
large
who
bore
burdens
on
their
backs
yet
in
the
faces
of
all
these
there
shone
not
savagery
alone
but
intelligence
and
resolution
with
them
were
flocks
and
herds
and
beasts
of
burden
and
carts
of
rude
build
and
beside
these
traveled
children
there
were
young
and
old
men
and
women
and
some
were
gaunt
and
weary
but
most
were
bold
and
strong
there
were
weapons
for
all
and
rude
implements
as
well
of
industry
in
the
faces
of
all
there
was
visible
the
spirit
of
their
leader
who
made
the
center
of
the
picture
foreground
i
saw
the
soul
of
that
canvas
a
splendid
resolution
a
look
forward
a
purpose
an
aim
to
be
attained
at
no
counting
of
cost
i
say
as
i
gazed
at
that
canvas
i
saw
in
it
the
columns
of
my
own
people
moving
westward
across
the
land
fearless
doubting
nothing
fearing
nothing
that
was
the
genius
of
america
when
i
myself
was
young
i
believe
it
still
to
be
the
spirit
of
a
triumphant
democracy
knowing
its
own
taking
its
own
holding
its
own
they
travel
yet
the
dauntless
figures
of
that
earlier
day
let
them
not
despair
no
imaginary
line
will
ever
hold
them
back
no
mandate
of
any
monarch
ever
can
restrain
them
in
our
own
caravans
now
pressing
on
for
the
general
movement
west
of
the
missouri
there
was
material
for
a
hundred
canvases
like
yonder
one
and
yet
more
vast
the
world
of
our
great
western
country
was
then
still
before
us
a
stern
and
warlike
people
was
resolved
to
hold
it
and
increase
it
of
these
i
now
was
one
i
felt
the
joy
of
that
thought
i
was
going
west
at
this
time
the
new
railroad
from
baltimore
extended
no
farther
westward
than
cumberland
yet
it
served
to
carry
one
well
toward
the
ohio
river
at
pittsburg
whence
down
the
ohio
and
up
the
missouri
to
leavenworth
my
journey
was
to
be
made
by
steamboats
in
this
prosaic
travel
the
days
passed
monotonously
but
at
length
i
found
myself
upon
that
frontier
which
then
marked
the
western
edge
of
our
accepted
domain
and
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
oregon
trail
if
i
can
not
bring
to
the
mind
of
one
living
the
full
picture
of
those
days
when
this
country
was
not
yet
all
ours
and
can
not
restore
to
the
comprehension
of
those
who
never
were
concerned
with
that
life
the
picture
of
that
great
highway
greatest
path
of
all
the
world
which
led
across
our
unsettled
countries
that
ancient
trail
at
least
may
be
a
memory
it
is
not
even
yet
wiped
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
it
still
remains
in
part
marked
now
no
longer
by
the
rotting
of
its
graves
by
the
bones
of
the
perished
ones
which
once
traveled
it
but
now
by
its
ribands
cut
through
the
turf
and
lined
by
nodding
prairie
flowers
the
old
trail
to
oregon
was
laid
out
by
no
government
arranged
by
no
engineer
planned
by
no
surveyor
supported
by
no
appropriation
it
sprang
a
road
already
created
from
the
earth
itself
covering
two
thousand
miles
of
our
country
why
because
there
was
need
for
that
country
to
be
covered
by
such
a
trail
at
such
a
time
because
we
needed
oregon
because
a
stalwart
and
democracy
needs
america
and
will
have
it
that
was
the
trail
over
which
our
people
outran
their
leaders
if
our
leaders
trifle
again
once
again
we
shall
outrun
them
there
were
at
this
date
but
four
places
of
human
residence
in
all
the
two
thousand
miles
of
this
trail
yet
recent
as
had
been
the
first
hoofs
and
wheels
to
mark
it
it
was
even
then
a
distinct
and
unmistakable
path
the
earth
has
never
had
nor
again
can
have
its
like
if
it
was
a
path
of
destiny
if
it
was
a
road
of
hope
and
confidence
so
was
it
a
road
of
misery
and
suffering
and
sacrifice
for
thus
has
the
democracy
always
gained
its
difficult
and
lasting
victories
i
think
that
it
was
there
somewhere
on
the
old
road
to
oregon
sometime
in
the
silent
watches
of
the
prairie
or
the
mountain
night
that
there
was
fought
out
the
battle
of
the
old
world
and
the
new
the
battle
between
oppressors
and
those
who
declared
they
no
longer
would
be
oppressed
providentially
for
us
an
ignorance
equal
to
that
of
our
leaders
existed
in
great
britain
for
us
who
waited
on
the
banks
of
the
missouri
all
this
ignorance
was
matter
of
indifference
our
men
got
their
beliefs
from
no
leaders
political
or
editorial
at
home
or
abroad
they
waited
only
for
the
grass
to
come
now
at
last
the
grass
did
begin
to
grow
upon
the
eastern
edge
of
the
great
plains
and
so
i
saw
begin
that
vast
and
splendid
movement
across
our
continent
which
in
comparison
dwarfs
all
the
great
people
movements
of
the
earth
xenophon
march
of
the
ten
thousand
pales
beside
this
of
ten
thousand
thousands
the
movements
of
the
goths
and
huns
the
vandals
the
cimri
in
a
way
they
had
a
like
significance
with
this
but
in
results
those
migrations
did
far
less
in
the
history
of
the
world
did
less
to
prove
the
purpose
of
the
world
i
watched
the
forming
of
our
caravan
and
i
saw
again
that
canvas
which
i
have
mentioned
that
picture
of
the
savages
who
traveled
a
thousand
years
before
christ
was
born
our
picture
was
the
vaster
the
more
splendid
the
more
enduring
here
were
savages
born
of
gentle
folk
in
part
who
never
yet
had
known
repulse
they
marched
with
flocks
and
herds
and
implements
of
husbandry
in
their
faces
shone
a
light
not
less
fierce
than
that
which
animated
the
dwellers
of
the
old
teutonic
forests
but
a
light
clearer
and
more
intelligent
here
was
the
determined
spirit
of
progress
here
was
the
agreed
insistence
upon
an
opportunity
ah
it
was
a
great
and
splendid
canvas
which
might
have
been
painted
there
on
our
plains
the
caravans
with
the
greening
grass
of
spring
that
hegira
of
americans
whose
unheard
command
was
but
the
voice
of
democracy
itself
we
carried
with
us
all
the
elements
of
society
as
has
the
ever
did
any
man
offend
against
the
unwritten
creed
of
fair
play
did
he
shirk
duty
when
that
meant
danger
to
the
common
good
then
he
was
brought
before
a
council
of
our
leaders
men
of
wisdom
and
fairness
chosen
by
the
vote
of
all
and
so
he
was
judged
and
he
was
punished
at
that
time
there
was
not
west
of
the
missouri
river
any
one
who
could
administer
an
oath
who
could
execute
a
legal
document
or
perpetuate
any
legal
testimony
yet
with
us
the
law
marched
across
the
land
we
had
leaders
chosen
because
they
were
fit
to
lead
and
leaders
who
felt
full
sense
of
responsibility
to
those
who
chose
them
we
had
with
us
great
wealth
in
flocks
and
herds
five
thousand
head
of
cattle
went
west
with
our
caravan
hundreds
of
horses
yet
each
knew
his
own
and
asked
not
that
of
his
neighbor
with
us
there
were
women
and
little
children
and
the
elders
bent
with
years
along
our
road
we
left
graves
here
and
there
for
death
went
with
us
in
our
train
also
were
many
births
life
coming
to
renew
the
cycle
at
times
too
there
were
rejoicings
of
the
newly
wed
in
our
train
our
young
couples
found
society
awheel
valid
as
that
abiding
under
permanent
roof
at
the
head
of
our
column
we
bore
the
flag
of
our
republic
on
our
flanks
were
skirmishers
like
those
guarding
the
flanks
of
an
army
it
an
army
an
army
of
our
people
with
us
marched
women
with
us
marched
home
was
the
difference
between
our
cavalcade
and
that
slower
and
more
selfish
one
made
up
of
men
alone
which
that
same
year
was
faring
westward
along
the
upper
reaches
of
the
canadian
plains
that
was
why
we
won
it
was
because
women
and
plows
were
with
us
our
great
column
made
up
of
more
than
one
hundred
wagons
was
divided
into
platoons
of
four
each
platoon
leading
for
a
day
then
falling
behind
to
take
the
bitter
dust
of
those
in
advance
at
noon
we
parted
our
wagons
in
platoons
and
at
night
we
drew
them
invariably
into
a
great
barricade
circular
in
form
the
leading
wagon
marking
out
the
circle
the
others
dropping
in
behind
the
tongue
of
each
against
the
of
the
wagon
ahead
and
the
last
wagon
closing
up
the
gap
our
circle
completed
the
animals
were
unyoked
and
the
tongues
were
chained
fast
to
the
wagons
next
ahead
so
that
each
night
we
had
a
sturdy
barricade
incapable
of
being
stampeded
by
savages
whom
more
than
once
we
fought
and
defeated
each
night
we
set
out
a
guard
our
men
taking
turns
and
the
night
watches
in
turn
rotating
so
that
each
man
got
his
share
of
the
entire
night
during
the
progress
of
his
journey
each
morn
we
rose
to
the
notes
of
a
bugle
and
each
day
we
marched
in
order
under
command
under
a
certain
schedule
loosely
connected
independent
individual
none
the
less
already
we
were
establishing
a
government
we
took
the
american
republic
with
us
across
the
plains
this
manner
of
travel
offered
much
monotony
yet
it
had
its
little
pleasures
for
my
own
part
my
early
experience
in
western
matters
placed
me
in
charge
of
our
band
of
hunters
whose
duty
it
was
to
ride
at
the
flanks
of
our
caravan
each
day
and
to
kill
sufficient
buffalo
for
meat
this
work
of
the
chase
gave
us
more
to
do
than
was
left
for
those
who
plodded
along
or
rode
bent
over
upon
the
wagon
seats
yet
even
for
these
there
was
some
relaxation
at
night
we
met
in
little
social
circles
around
the
young
folk
made
love
old
folk
made
plans
here
as
they
had
at
home
a
church
marched
with
us
as
well
as
the
law
and
courts
and
what
was
more
the
schools
went
also
for
by
the
faint
flicker
of
the
firelight
many
parents
taught
their
children
each
day
as
they
moved
westward
to
their
new
homes
history
shows
these
children
were
well
taught
there
were
persons
of
education
and
culture
with
us
music
we
had
and
of
a
night
time
even
while
the
coyotes
were
calling
and
the
wind
whispering
in
the
short
grasses
of
the
plains
violin
and
flute
would
sometimes
blend
their
voices
and
i
have
thus
heard
songs
which
i
would
not
exchange
in
memory
for
others
which
i
have
heard
in
surroundings
far
more
ambitious
sometimes
dances
were
held
on
the
greensward
of
our
camps
regularly
the
sabbath
day
was
observed
by
at
least
the
most
part
of
our
pilgrims
upon
all
our
party
there
seemed
to
sit
an
air
of
content
and
certitude
of
all
our
wagons
i
presume
one
was
of
greatest
value
it
was
filled
with
earth
to
the
brim
and
in
it
were
fruit
trees
planted
and
shrubs
and
its
owner
carried
seeds
of
garden
plants
without
doubt
it
was
our
mission
and
our
intent
to
take
with
us
such
civilization
as
we
had
left
behind
so
we
marched
mingled
and
as
some
might
have
said
motley
in
our
personnel
sons
of
some
of
the
best
families
in

georgia
and
louisiana
men
from
pennsylvania
and
ohio
roundhead
and
cavalier
easterner
and
westerner
germans
yankees
all
americans
we
marched
i
say
under
a
form
of
government
yet
each
took
his
original
marching
orders
from
his
own
soul
we
marched
across
an
america
not
yet
won
below
us
lay
the
spanish
civilization
mexico
possibly
soon
to
be
led
by
britain
as
some
thought
north
of
us
was
canada
now
fully
alarmed
and
surely
led
by
britain
west
of
us
all
around
us
lay
the
indian
tribes
behind
never
again
to
be
seen
by
most
of
us
who
marched
lay
the
homes
of
an
earlier
generation
but
we
marched
each
obeying
the
orders
of
his
own
soul
some
day
the
song
of
this
may
be
sung
some
day
perhaps
its
canvas
may
be
painted

moore
twenty
miles
a
day
week
in
and
week
out
we
edged
westward
up
the
platte
in
heat
and
dust
part
of
the
time
often
plagued
at
night
by
clouds
of
mosquitoes
our
men
endured
the
penalties
of
the
journey
without
comment
i
do
not
recall
that
i
ever
heard
even
the
weakest
woman
complain
thus
at
last
we
reached
the
south
pass
of
the
rockies
not
yet
half
done
our
journey
and
entered
upon
that
portion
of
the
trail
west
of
the
rockies
which
had
still
two
mountain
ranges
to
cross
and
which
was
even
more
apt
to
be
infested
by
the
hostile
indians
even
when
we
reached
the
ragged
trading
post
fort
hall
we
had
still
more
than
six
hundred
miles
to
go
by
this
time
our
forces
had
wasted
as
though
under
assault
of
arms
far
back
on
the
trail
many
had
been
forced
to
leave
prized
belongings
relics
heirlooms
implements
machinery
all
conveniences
the
finest
of
mahogany
blistered
in
the
sun
abandoned
and
unheeded
our
trail
might
have
been
followed
by
discarded
implements
of
agriculture
and
by
whitened
bones
as
well
our
footsore
teams
gaunt
and
weakened
began
to
faint
and
fall
horses
and
oxen
died
in
the
harness
or
under
the
yoke
and
were
perforce
abandoned
where
they
fell
each
pound
of
superfluous
weight
was
cast
away
as
our
motive
power
thus
lessened
wagons
were
abandoned
goods
were
packed
on
horses
oxen
and
cows
we
put
cows
into
the
yoke
now
and
used
women
instead
of
men
on
the
drivers
seats
and
boys
who
started
riding
finished
afoot
our
herds
were
sadly
lessened
by
theft
of
the
indians
by
death
by
strayings
which
our
guards
had
not
time
to
follow
up
if
a
wagon
lagged
it
was
sawed
shorter
to
lessen
its
weight
sometimes
the
hind
wheels
were
abandoned
and
the
reduced
personal
belongings
were
packed
on
the
cart
thus
made
which
nevertheless
traveled
on
painfully
slowly
yet
always
going
ahead
in
the
deserts
beyond
fort
hall
wagons
disintegrated
by
the
heat
wheels
would
fall
apart
couplings
break
under
the
straining
teams
still
more
here
was
the
trail
lined
with
boxes
vehicles
furniture
all
the
flotsam
and
jetsam
of
the
long
long
oregon
trail
the
grass
was
burned
to
its
roots
the
streams
were
reduced
to
ribbons
the
mirages
of
the
desert
mocked
us
desperately
rain
came
seldom
now
and
the
of
the
desert
was
white
with
bitter
dust
which
in
vast
clouds
rose
sometimes
in
the
wind
to
make
our
journey
the
harder
in
autumn
as
we
approached
the
second
range
of
mountains
we
could
see
the
taller
peaks
whitened
with
snow
our
leaders
looked
anxiously
ahead
dreading
the
storms
which
must
ere
long
overtake
us
still
gaunt
now
and
haggard
weakened
in
body
but
not
in
soul
we
pressed
on
across
that
was
the
way
to
oregon
gaunt
and
brown
and
savage
hungry
and
grim
ragged
hatless
shoeless
our
cavalcade
closed
up
and
came
on
and
so
at
last
came
through
ere
autumn
had
yellowed
all
the
foliage
back
east
in
gentler
climes
we
crossed
the
shoulders
of
the
blue
mountains
and
came
into
the
valley
of
the
walla
walla
and
so
passed
thence
down
the
columbia
to
the
valley
of
the
willamette
three
hundred
miles
yet
farther
where
there
were
then
some
slight
centers
of
our
civilization
which
had
gone
forward
the
year
before
here
were
some
few
americans
at
champoeg
at
the
little
american
missions
at
oregon
city
and
other
scattered
points
we
met
them
we
hailed
and
were
hailed
by
them
they
were
americans
women
and
plows
were
with
them
there
were
churches
and
schools
already
started
and
a
beginning
had
been
made
in
government
faces
and
hands
and
ways
and
customs
and
laws
of
our
own
people
greeted
us
yes
it
was
america
messengers
spread
abroad
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
our
wagon
train
messengers
too
came
down
from
the
hudson
bay
posts
to
scan
our
equipment
and
estimate
our
numbers
there
was
no
word
obtainable
from
these
of
any
canadian
column
of
occupation
to
the
northward
which
had
crossed
at
the
head
of
the
peace
river
or
the
saskatchewan
or
which
lay
ready
at
the
head
waters
of
the
fraser
or
the
columbia
to
come
down
to
the
lower
settlements
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
to
an
issue
or
making
more
difficult
this
question
of
the
joint
occupancy
of
oregon
as
a
matter
of
fact
ultimately
we
won
that
transcontinental
race
so
decidedly
that
there
never
was
admitted
to
have
been
a
second
as
for
our
people
they
knew
how
neither
to
hesitate
nor
to
dread
they
unhooked
their
oxen
from
the
wagons
and
put
them
to
the
plows
the
fruit
trees
which
had
crossed
three
ranges
of
mountains
and
two
thousand
miles
of
unsettled
country
now
found
new
rooting
streams
which
had
borne
no
fruit
save
that
of
the
beaver
traps
now
were
made
to
give
tribute
to
little
fields
and
gardens
or
asked
to
transport
wheat
instead
of
furs
the
forests
which
had
blocked
our
way
were
now
made
into
roofs
and
walls
and
fences
whatever
the
future
might
bring
those
who
had
come
so
far
and
dared
so
much
feared
that
future
no
more
than
they
had
feared
the
troubles
which
in
detail
they
had
overcome
in
their
vast
pilgrimage
so
we
took
oregon
by
the
only
law
of
right
our
broken
and
weakened
cavalcade
asked
renewal
from
the
soil
itself
we
ruffled
no
drum
fluttered
no
flag
to
take
possession
of
the
land
but
the
canvas
covers
of
our
wagons
gave
way
to
permanent
roofs
where
we
had
known
a
hundred
now
we
lighted
the
fires
of
many
hundred
homes

our
army
of

scattered
along
the
more
fertile
parts
of
the
land
principally
among
the
valleys
of
course
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
what
was
then
called
oregon
meant
all
of
what
now
is
embraced
in
oregon
washington
and
idaho
with
part

as
well
it
extended
south
to
the
mexican
possessions
of
california
how
far
north
it
was
to
run
it
was
my
errand
here
to
learn
to
all
apparent
purposes
i
simply
was
one
of
the
new
settlers
in
oregon
animated
by
like
motives
possessed
of
little
more
means
and
disposed
to
adjust
myself
to
existing
circumstances
much
as
did
my
fellows
the
physical
conditions
of
life
in
a
country
abounding
in
wild
game
and
fish
and
where
even
careless
planting
would
yield
abundant
crops
offered
no
very
difficult
task
to
young
men
accustomed
to
shifting
for
themselves
so
that
i
looked
forward
to
the
winter
with
no
dread
i
settled
near
the
mouth
of
the
willamette
river
near
oregon
city
and
not
far
from
where
the
city
of
portland
later
was
begun
and
builded
for
myself
a
little
cabin
of
two
rooms
with
a
connecting
roof
this
i
furnished
as
did
my
neighbors
their
similar
abodes
with
a
table
made
of
hewed
puncheons
chairs
sawed
from
blocks
a
bed
framed
from
poles
on
which
lay
a
rude
mattress
of
husks
and
straw
my
were
made
of
oiled
deer
hide
thinking
that
perhaps
i
might
need
to
plow
in
the
coming
season
i
made
me
a
plow
like
those
around
me
which
might
have
come
from
mexico
or
egypt
a
forked
limb
bound
with
rawhide
wood
and
hide
were
indeed
our
only
materials
if
a
wagon
wheel
showed
signs
of
disintegration
we
lashed
it
together
with
rawhide
when
the
settlers
of
the
last
year
sought
to
carry
wheat
to
market
on
the
willamette
barges
they
did
so
in
sacks
made
of
the
hides
of
deer
our
clothing
was
of
skins
and
furs
from
the
eastern
states
i
scarcely
could
now
hear
in
less
than
a
year
for
another
wagon
train
could
not
start
west
from
the
missouri
until
the
following
spring
we
could
only
guess
how
events
were
going
forward
in
our
diplomacy
we
did
not
know
and
would
not
know
for
a
year
the
result
of
the
democratic
convention
at
baltimore
of
the
preceding
spring
we
could
only
wonder
who
might
be
the
party
nominees
for
the
presidency
we
had
a
national
government
but
did
not
know
what
it
was
or
who
administered
it
war
might
be
declared
but
we
in
oregon
would
not
be
aware
of
it
again
war
might
break
out
in
oregon
and
the
government
at
washington
could
not
know
that
fact
the
mild
winter
wore
away
and
i
learned
little
spring
came
and
still
no
word
of
any
land
expedition
out
of
canada
we
and
the
hudson
bay
folk
still
dwelt
in
peace
the
flowers
began
to
bloom
in
the
wild
meads
and
the
horses
fattened
on
their
native
pastures
wider
and
wider
lay
the
areas
of
black
overturned
soil
as
our
busy
farmers
kept
on
at
their
work
wider
grew
the
clearings
in
the
forest
lands
our
fruit
trees
which
we
had
brought
two
thousand
miles
in
the
nursery
wagon
began
to
put
out
tender
leafage
there
were
eastern
flowers
marigolds
hollyhocks
mignonette
planted
in
the
front
yards
of
our
little
cabins
vines
were
trained
over
trellises
here
and
there
each
flower
was
a
rivet
each
vine
a
cord
which
bound
oregon
to
our
republic
summer
came
on
the
fields
began
to
whiten
with
the
ripening
grain
i
grew
uneasy
feeling
myself
only
an
idler
in
a
land
so
able
to
fend
for
itself
i
now
was
much
disposed
to
discuss
means
of
getting
back
over
the
long
trail
to
the
eastward
to
carry
the
news
that
oregon
was
ours
i
had
it
must
be
confessed
nothing
new
to
suggest
as
to
making
it
firmly
and
legally
ours
beyond
what
had
already
been
suggested
in
the
minds
of
our
settlers
themselves
it
was
at
this
time
that
there
occurred
a
startling
and
decisive
event
i
was
on
my
way
on
a
canoe
voyage
up
the
wide
columbia
not
far
above
the
point
where
it
receives
its
greatest
lower
tributary
the
willamette
when
all
at
once
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
cannon
shot
i
turned
to
see
the
cloud
of
blue
smoke
still
hanging
over
the
surface
of
the
water
slowly
there
swung
into
view
an
vessel
under
steam
and
auxiliary
canvas
she
made
a
gallant
spectacle
but
whose
ship
was
she
i
examined
her
colors
anxiously
enough
i
caught
the
import
of
her
ensign
she
flew
the
british
union
jack
england
had
won
the
race
by
sea
something
in
the
ship
outline
seemed
to
me
familiar
i
knew
the
set
of
her
short
masts
the
pitch
of
her
smokestacks
the
number
of
her
guns
yes
she
was
the
of
the
english
navy
the
same
ship
which
more
than
a
year
before
i
had
seen
at
anchor
off
montreal
news
travels
fast
in
wild
countries
and
it
took
us
little
time
to
learn
the
destination
of
the
she
came
to
anchor
above
oregon
city
and
well
below
fort
vancouver
at
once
of
course
her
officers
made
formal
calls
upon
doctor
mclaughlin
the
factor
at
fort
vancouver
and
accepted
head
of
the
british
element
thereabouts
two
weeks
passed
in
rumors
and
counter
rumors
and
a
vastly
dangerous
tension
existed
in
all
the
american
settlements
because
word
was
spread
that
england
had
sent
a
ship
to
oust
us
then
came
to
myself
and
certain
others
at
oregon
city
messengers
from
doctor
mclaughlin
asking
us
to
join
him
in
a
little
celebration
in
honor
of
the
arrival
of
her
majesty
vessel
here
at
last
was
news
but
it
was
news
not
wholly
to
my
liking
which
i
soon
unearthed
the
was
but
one
ship
of
fifteen
a
fleet
of
fifteen
vessels
four
hundred
guns
then
lay
in
puget
sound
the
of
great
britain
were
at
our
doors
this
question
of
monarchy
and
the
republic
was
not
yet
settled
after
all
i
pass
the
story
of
the
banquet
at
fort
vancouver
because
it
is
unpleasant
to
recite
the
difficulties
of
a
kindly
host
who
finds
himself
with
jarring
elements
at
his
board
precisely
this
was
the
situation
of
doctor
mclaughlin
of
fort
vancouver
it
was
an
incongruous
assembly
in
the
first
place
the
officers
of
the
british
navy
attended
in
the
splendor
of
their
uniforms
glittering
in
braid
and
gold
even
doctor
mclaughlin
made
brave
display
as
was
his
wont
in
his
regalia
of
dark
blue
cloth
and
shining
buttons
his
noble
features
and
long
hair
making
him
the
most
lordly
figure
of
them
all
as
for
us
americans
lean
and
brown
with
hands
hardened
by
toil
our
wardrobes
scattered
over
a
thousand
miles
of
trail
buckskin
tunics
made
our
coats
and
moccasins
our
boots
i
have
seen
some
noble
gentlemen
so
clad
in
my
day
we
americans
were
forced
to
listen
to
many
toasts
at
that
little
frontier
banquet
entirely
to
our
disliking
we
heard
from
captain
parke
that
the
columbia
belonged
to
great
britain
as
much
as
the
thames
that
great
britain
guns
could
blow
all
the
americans
off
the
map
that
her
fleet
at
puget
sound
waited
but
for
the
signal
to
hoist
the
british
flag
over
all
the
coast
from
mexico
to
russia
yet
doctor
mclaughlin
kindly
and
gentle
as
always
better
advised
than
any
one
there
on
the
intricacies
of
the
situation
now
in
hand
only
smiled
and
protested
and
explained
for
myself
i
passed
only
as
plain
settler
no
one
knew
my
errand
in
the
country
and
i
took
pains
though
my
blood
boiled
as
did
that
of
our
other
americans
present
at
that
board
to
keep
a
silent
tongue
in
my
head
if
this
were
joint
occupancy
i
for
one
was
ready
to
say
it
was
time
to
make
an
end
of
it
but
how
might
that
be
done
at
least
the
proceedings
of
the
evening
gave
no
answer
it
was
as
may
be
supposed
late
in
the
night
when
our
somewhat
discordant
banqueting
party
broke
up
we
were
all
housed
as
was
the
hospitable
fashion
of
the
country
in
the
scattered
log
buildings
which
nearly
always
hedge
in
a
western
post
the
quarters
assigned
me
lay
across
the
open
space
or
what
might
be
called
the
parade
ground
of
fort
vancouver
flanked
by
doctor
mclaughlin
four
little
cannon
as
i
made
my
way
home
stumbling
among
the
stumps
in
the
dark
i
passed
many
indians
and
to
whom
special
liberty
had
been
accorded
in
view
of
the
occasion
all
of
them
now
engaged
in
singing
the
praises
of
the
king
george
men
as
against
the
bostons
i
talked
now
and
again
with
some
of
our
own
brown
and
silent
border
men
farmers
from
the
willamette
none
of
them
any
too
happy
all
of
them
sullen
and
ready
for
trouble
in
any
form
we
agreed
among
us
that
absolute
quiet
and
freedom
from
any
expression
of
irritation
was
our
safest
plan
wait
till
next
fall
wagon
trains
come
in
that
was
the
expression
of
our
new
governor
applegate
and
i
fancy
it
found
an
echo
in
the
opinions
of
most
of
the
americans
by
snowfall
as
we
believed
the
balance
of
power
would
be
all
upon
our
side
and
our
rifles
would
outweigh
all
their
anchored
cannon
i
was
almost
at
my
cabin
door
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
frontage
at
the
rear
of
the
old
post
when
i
caught
glimpse
in
the
dim
light
of
a
hurrying
figure
which
in
some
way
seemed
to
be
different
from
the
squaws
who
stalked
here
and
there
about
the
post
grounds
at
first
i
thought
she
might
be
the
squaw
of
one
of
the
employees
of
the
company
who
lived
scattered
about
some
of
them
now
by
the
advice
of
doctor
mclaughlin
beginning
to
till
little
fields
but
as
i
have
said
there
was
something
in
the
stature
or
carriage
or
garb
of
this
woman
which
caused
me
idly
to
follow
her
at
first
with
my
eyes
and
then
with
my
footsteps
she
passed
steadily
on
toward
a
long
and
low
log
cabin
located
a
short
distance
beyond
the
quarters
which
had
been
assigned
to
me
i
saw
her
step
up
to
the
door
and
heard
her
knock
then
there
came
a
flood
of
light
more
light
than
was
usual
in
the
opening
of
the
door
of
a
frontier
cabin
this
displayed
the
figure
of
the
night
walker
showing
her
tall
and
gaunt
and
a
little
stooped
so
that
after
all
i
took
her
to
be
only
one
of
our
american
frontier
women
being
quite
sure
that
she
was
not
indian
or
this
emboldened
me
on
a
mere
chance
an
act
whose
mental
origin
i
could
not
have
traced
to
step
up
to
the
door
after
it
had
been
closed
and
myself
to
knock
thereat
if
it
were
a
party
of
americans
here
i
wished
to
question
them
if
not
i
intended
to
make
excuses
by
asking
my
way
to
my
own
quarters
it
was
my
business
to
learn
the
news
of
oregon
i
heard
women
voices
within
and
as
i
knocked
the
door
opened
just
a
trifle
on
its
chain
i
saw
appear
at
the
crack
the
face
of
the
woman
whom
i
had
followed
she
was
as
i
had
believed
old
and
wrinkled
and
her
face
now
seen
close
was
as
mysterious
dark
and
inscrutable
as
that
of
any
indian
squaw
her
hair
fell
heavy
and
gray
across
her
forehead
and
her
eyes
were
small
and
dark
as
those
of
a
native
woman
yet
as
she
stood
there
with
the
light
streaming
upon
her
i
saw
something
in
her
face
which
made
me
puzzle
ponder
and
start
and
put
my
foot
within
the
crack
of
the
door
when
she
found
she
could
not
close
the
door
she
called
out
in
some
foreign
tongue
i
heard
a
voice
answer
the
blood
tingled
in
the
roots
of
my
hair
threlka
i
said
quietly
tell
madam
the
baroness
it
is
i
monsieur
trist
of
washington
chapter
xxvii
in
the
cabin
of
madam
woman
must
not
belong
to
herself
she
is
bound
to
alien
von
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
the
old
woman
departed
from
the
door
i
heard
the
rustle
of
a
footfall
i
could
have
told
in
advance
what
face
would
now
appear
outlined
in
the
candle
glow
with
eyes
wide
and
startled
with
lips
half
parted
in
query
it
was
the
face
of
helena
baroness
von
ritz
bien
madam
why
do
you
bar
me
out
i
said
as
though
we
had
parted
but
yesterday
in
her
sheer
astonishment
i
presume
she
let
down
the
fastening
chain
and
without
her
invitation
i
stepped
within
i
heard
her
startled
dieu
then
her
more
deliberate
exclamation
of
emotion
my
god
she
said
she
stood
with
her
hands
caught
at
her
throat
staring
at
me
i
laughed
and
held
out
a
hand
madam
baroness
i
said
how
glad
i
am
come
has
not
fate
been
kind
to
us
again
i
pushed
shut
the
door
behind
me
still
without
a
word
she
stepped
deeper
into
the
room
and
stood
looking
at
me
her
hands
clasped
now
loosely
and
awkwardly
as
though
she
were
a
country
girl
surprised
and
not
the
baroness
helena
von
ritz
toast
or
talk
of
more
than
one
capital
of
the
world
yet
she
was
the
same
she
seemed
slightly
thinner
now
yet
not
less
beautiful
her
eyes
were
dark
and
brilliant
as
ever
the
clear
features
of
her
face
were
framed
in
the
roll
of
her
heavy
locks
as
i
had
seen
them
last
her
garb
as
usual
betokened
luxury
she
was
robed
as
though
for
some
fête
all
in
white
satin
and
pale
blue
fires
of
stones
shone
faintly
at
throat
and
wrist
contrast
enough
she
made
to
me
clad
in
tunic
of
buck
with
the
leggings
and
moccasins
of
a
savage
my
belt
lacking
but
prepared
for
weapons
i
had
not
time
to
puzzle
over
the
question
of
her
errand
here
why
or
whence
she
had
come
or
what
she
purposed
doing
i
was
occupied
with
the
sudden
surprises
which
her
surroundings
offered
i
see
madam
said
i
smiling
that
still
i
am
only
asleep
and
dreaming
but
how
exquisite
a
dream
here
in
this
wild
country
how
unfit
here
am
i
a
savage
who
introduce
the
one
discordant
note
into
so
sweet
a
dream
i
gestured
to
my
costume
gestured
about
me
as
i
took
in
the
details
of
the
long
room
in
which
we
stood
i
swear
it
was
the
same
as
that
in
which
i
had
seen
her
at
a
similar
hour
in
montreal
it
was
the
same
i
had
first
seen
in
washington
impossible
i
am
doubted
ah
but
do
i
not
know
did
i
not
see
here
were
the
pictures
on
the
walls
the
carved
cupids
the
candelabra
with
their
prisms
the
chairs
the
couches
beyond
yonder
satin
curtains
rose
the
high
canopy
of
the
couch
its
fringed
drapery
reaching
almost
to
the
deep
pile
of
the
carpets
true
opportunity
had
not
yet
offered
for
the
full
concealment
of
these
rude
walls
yet
as
my
senses
convinced
me
even
against
themselves
here
were
the
apartments
of
helena
von
ritz
furnished
as
she
had
told
me
they
always
were
at
each
place
she
saw
fit
to
honor
with
her
presence
yet
not
quite
the
same
it
seemed
to
me
there
were
some
little
things
missing
just
as
there
were
some
little
things
missing
from
her
appearance
for
instance
these
draperies
at
the
right
which
formerly
had
cut
off
the
napoleon
bed
at
its
end
of
the
room
now
were
of
blankets
and
not
of
silk
the
bed
itself
was
not
piled
deep
in
down
but
contained
as
i
fancied
from
my
hurried
glance
a
thin
mattress
stuffed
perhaps
with
straw
a
roll
of
blankets
lay
across
its
foot
as
i
gazed
to
the
farther
extremity
of
this
side
of
the
long
suite
i
saw
other
evidences
of
change
it
was
indeed
as
though
helena
von
ritz
creature
of
luxury
woman
of
an
old
luxurious
world
exotic
of
monarchical
surroundings
had
begun
insensibly
to
slip
into
the
ways
of
the
rude
democracy
of
the
far
frontiers
i
saw
all
this
but
ere
i
had
finished
my
first
hurried
glance
i
had
accepted
her
as
always
one
must
just
as
she
was
had
accepted
her
surroundings
preposterously
impossible
as
they
all
were
from
any
logical
point
of
view
as
fitting
to
herself
and
to
her
humor
it
was
not
for
me
to
ask
how
or
why
she
did
these
things
she
had
done
them
because
here
they
were
and
here
was
she
we
had
found
england
woman
on
the
columbia
yes
said
she
at
length
slowly
yes
i
now
believe
it
to
be
fate
she
had
not
yet
smiled
i
took
her
hand
and
held
it
long
i
felt
glad
to
see
her
and
to
take
her
hand
it
seemed
pledge
of
friendship
and
as
things
now
were
shaping
i
surely
needed
a
friend
at
last
her
face
flushing
slightly
she
disengaged
her
hand
and
motioned
me
to
a
seat
but
still
we
stood
silent
for
a
few
moments
have
you
curiosity
said
she
at
length
i
am
too
happy
to
have
curiosity
my
dear
madam
you
will
not
even
ask
me
why
i
am
here
she
insisted
i
know
i
have
known
all
along
you
are
in
the
pay
of
england
when
i
missed
you
at
montreal
i
knew
you
had
sailed
on
the
for
oregon
we
knew
all
this
and
planned
for
it
i
have
come
across
by
land
to
meet
you
i
have
waited
i
greet
you
now
she
looked
me
now
clearly
in
the
face
i
am
not
sure
said
she
at
length
slowly
not
sure
of
what
madam
when
you
travel
on
england
warship
i
smiled
you
travel
as
the
guest
of
england
herself
if
then
you
are
not
for
england
in
god
name
friend
are
you
whose
friend
am
i
she
answered
slowly
i
say
to
you
that
i
do
not
know
nor
do
i
know
who
is
my
friend
a
friend
what
is
that
i
never
knew
one
then
be
mine
let
me
be
your
friend
you
know
my
history
you
know
about
me
and
my
work
i
throw
my
secret
into
your
hands
you
will
not
betray
me
you
warned
me
once
at
montreal
will
you
not
shield
me
once
again
she
nodded
smiling
now
in
an
amused
way
monsieur
always
takes
the
most
extraordinary
times
to
visit
me
monsieur
asks
always
the
most
extraordinary
things
monsieur
does
always
the
most
extraordinary
acts
he
takes
me
to
call
upon
a
gentleman
in
a
night
robe
he
calls
upon
me
himself
of
an
evening
in
dinner
dress
of
hides
and
beads
is
the
best
i
have
madam
i
colored
but
her
eye
had
not
criticism
though
her
speech
had
mockery
this
is
the
costume
of
your
american
savages
she
said
i
find
it
among
the
most
beautiful
i
have
ever
seen
only
a
man
can
wear
it
you
wear
it
like
a
man
i
like
you
in
it
i
have
never
liked
you
so
well
betray
you
monsieur
why
should
i
how
could
i
that
is
true
why
should
you
you
are
helena
von
ritz
one
of
her
breeding
does
not
betray
men
or
women
neither
does
she
make
any
journeys
of
this
sort
without
a
purpose
i
had
a
purpose
when
i
started
i
changed
it
in
now
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
orient
and
had
forgotten
your
report
to
mr
pakenham
i
shook
my
head
madam
you
are
the
guest
of
england
i
never
denied
that
she
said
i
was
that
in
washington
i
was
so
in
montreal
but
i
have
never
given
pledge
which
left
me
other
than
free
to
go
as
i
liked
i
have
studied
that
is
true
but
i
have
reported
have
we
not
been
fair
with
you
baroness
has
my
chief
not
proved
himself
fair
with
you
yes
she
nodded
you
have
played
the
game
fairly
that
is
true
then
you
will
play
it
fair
with
us
come
i
say
you
have
still
that
chance
to
win
the
gratitude
of
a
people
i
begin
to
understand
you
better
you
americans
she
said
irrelevantly
as
was
sometimes
her
fancy
see
my
bed
yonder
it
is
that
couch
of
husks
of
which
monsieur
told
me
here
is
the
cabin
of
logs
there
is
the
fireplace
here
is
helena
von
ritz
even
as
you
told
me
once
before
she
sometime
might
be
and
here
on
my
wrists
are
the
imprints
of
your
fingers
what
does
it
mean
monsieur
am
i
not
an
apt
student
see
i
made
up
that
little
bed
with
my
own
hands
i
why
see
i
can
cook
what
you
once
said
to
me
lingered
in
my
mind
at
first
it
was
matter
only
of
curiosity
presently
i
began
to
see
what
was
beneath
your
words
what
fullness
of
life
there
might
be
even
in
poverty
i
said
to
myself
god
were
it
not
after
all
enough
this
if
one
be
loved
so
then
in
spite
of
myself
without
planning
i
say
i
began
to
understand
i
have
seen
about
me
here
these
savages
savages
who
have
walked
thousands
of
miles
in
a
pilgrimage
for
what
for
what
madam
i
demanded
for
what
for
a
cabin
for
a
bed
of
husks
was
it
then
for
the
sake
of
ease
for
the
sake
of
selfishness
come
can
you
betray
a
people
of
whom
you
can
say
so
much
ah
now
you
would
try
to
tempt
me
from
a
trust
which
has
been
reposed
in
me
not
in
the
least
i
would
not
have
you
break
your
word
with
pakenham
but
i
know
you
are
here
on
the
same
errand
as
myself
you
are
to
learn
facts
and
report
them
to
pakenham
as
i
am
to
mr
calhoun
what
does
monsieur
suggest
she
asked
me
with
her
little
smile
nothing
except
that
you
take
back
all
the
facts
and
allow
them
to
mediate
let
them
determine
between
the
old
world
and
this
new
one
your
satin
couch
and
this
rude
one
you
have
learned
to
make
tell
the
truth
only
choose
then
madam
nations
do
not
ask
the
truth
they
want
only
excuses
quite
true
and
because
of
that
all
the
more
rests
with
you
if
this
situation
goes
on
war
must
come
it
can
not
be
averted
unless
it
be
by
some
agency
quite
outside
of
these
two
governments
here
then
madam
is
helena
von
ritz
at
least
there
is
time
she
mused
these
ships
are
not
here
for
any
immediate
active
war
great
britain
will
make
no
move
until
until
madam
the
baroness
special

of
your
facts

country

do
not
yet
know
these
men
the
same
savages
who
once
accounted
for
another

new
orleans

as
buffaloes
fierce
as

once

you
credit
me
with
very
much
ability
she
smiled
with
all
ability
what
conquests
you
have
made
in
the
diplomacy
of
the
old
world
i
do
not
know
you
have
known
courts
i
have
known
none
yet
you
are
learning
life
you
are
learning
the
meaning
of
the
only
human
idea
of
the
world
that
of
a
democracy
of
endeavor
where
all
are
equal
in
their
chances
and
in
their
hopes
that
madam
is
the
only
diplomacy
which
will
live
if
you
have
passed
on
that
torch
of
principle
of
which
you
spoke
if
i
can
do
as
much
then
all
will
be
well
we
shall
have
served
she
dropped
now
into
a
chair
near
by
a
little
table
where
the
light
of
the
tall
candles
guttering
in
their
enameled
sconces
fell
full
upon
her
face
she
looked
at
me
fixedly
her
eyes
dark
and
mournful
in
spite
of
their
eagerness
ah
it
is
easy
for
you
to
speak
easy
for
you
who
have
so
rich
and
full
a
life
who
have
all
but
i
my
hands
are
empty
she
spread
out
her
curved
fingers
looking
at
them
dropping
her
hands
pathetically
drooping
her
shoulders
all
madam
what
do
you
mean
you
see
me
almost
in
rags
beyond
the
rifle
at
my
cabin
the
pistol
at
my
tent
i
have
scarce
more
in
wealth
than
what
i
wear
while
you
have
what
you
like
all
but
everything
she
murmured
all
but
home
nor
have
i
a
home
all
except
that
my
couch
is
empty
save
for
myself
and
my
memories
not
more
than
mine
nor
with
sadder
memories
madam
why
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
me
suddenly
what
do
you
she
repeated
it
again
as
though
half
in
horror
only
that
we
are
equal
and
alike
that
we
are
here
on
the
same
errand
that
our
view
of
life
should
be
the
same
what
do
you
mean
about
home
but
tell
me
you
not
then
married
no
i
am
alone
madam
i
never
shall
be
married
there
may
have
been
some
slight
motion
of
a
hand
which
beckoned
me
to
a
seat
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
as
i
sat
i
saw
her
search
my
face
carefully
slowly
with
eyes
i
could
not
read
at
last
she
spoke
after
her
frequent
fashion
half
to
herself
it
succeeded
then
said
she
yet
i
am
not
happy
yet
i
have
failed
i
pause
madam
said
i
smiling
i
await
your
pleasure
ah
god
ah
god
she
sighed
what
have
i
done
she
staggered
to
her
feet
and
stood
beating
her
hands
together
as
was
her
way
when
perturbed
what
have
i
threlka
i
heard
her
call
half
chokingly
the
old
servant
came
hurriedly
wine
tea
anything
threlka
she
dropped
down
again
opposite
me
panting
and
looking
at
me
with
wide
eyes
tell
me
do
you
know
what
you
have
said
she
began
no
madam
i
grieve
if
i
have
caused
you
any
pain
well
then
you
are
noble
when
look
what
pain
i
have
caused
you
yet
not
more
than
myself
no
not
so
much
i
hope
not
so
much
truly
there
is
thought
which
passes
from
mind
to
mind
suddenly
the
thing
in
her
mind
sped
across
to
mine
i
looked
at
her
suddenly
in
my
eyes
also
perhaps
the
horror
which
i
felt
it
was
you
i
exclaimed
it
was
you
ah
now
i
begin
to
understand
how
could
you
you
parted
us
parted
me
from
elisabeth
yes
she
said
regretfully
i
did
it
it
was
my
fault
i
rose
and
drew
apart
from
her
unable
to
speak
she
went
on
but
i
was
not
then
as
i
am
now
see
i
was
embittered
reckless
desperate
i
was
only
beginning
to
think
i
only
wanted
time
i
did
not
really
mean
to
do
all
this
i
only
thought
why
i
had
not
yet
known
you
a
day
nor
her
an
hour
was
all
no
more
than
half
a
jest
how
could
you
do
it
i
demanded
yet
that
is
no
more
strange
how
you
do
it
at
the
door
that
first
night
i
was
mad
then
over
the
wrong
done
to
what
little
womanhood
i
could
claim
for
my
own
i
hated
yturrio
i
hated
pakenham
they
had
both
insulted
me
i
hated
every
man
i
had
seen
nothing
but
the
bitter
and
desperate
side
of
life
i
was
eager
to
take
revenge
even
upon
the
innocent
ones
of
this
world
seeing
that
i
had
suffered
so
much
i
had
an
old
grudge
against
women
against
women
i
say
against
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
i
saw
her
eyes
no
more
till
threlka
came
and
lifted
her
head
offering
her
a
cup
of
drink
and
so
standing
patiently
until
again
she
had
dismissal
but
still
it
is
all
a
puzzle
to
me
madam
i
began
i
do
not
understand
well
when
you
stood
at
the
door
my
little
shoe
in
your
pocket
when
you
kissed
my
hand
that
first
night
when
you
told
me
what
you
would
do
did
you
love
a
woman
when
i
saw
something
new
in
life
i
had
not
seen
why
then
in
the
devil
resolution
that
no
woman
in
the
world
should
be
happy
if
i
could
help
it
i
slipped
in
the
body
of
the
slipper
a
little
line
or
so
that
i
had
written
when
you
did
not
see
when
i
was
in
the
other
room
was
that
took
the
place
of
van
zandt
message
after
all
monsieur
it
was
fate
van
zandt
letter
without
plan
fell
out
on
my
table
your
note
sent
by
plan
remained
in
the
shoe
and
what
did
it
say
tell
me
at
once
very
little
yet
enough
fora
woman
who
loved
and
who
expected
only
this
spite
of
that
other
woman
come
to
me
still
who
can
teach
yon
love
of
woman
as
can
i
i
think
it
was
some
such
words
as
those
i
looked
at
her
in
silence
you
did
not
see
that
note
she
demanded
after
all
at
first
i
meant
it
only
for
i
wanted
to
see
you
again
i
did
not
want
to
lose
you
ah
god
i
was
so
lonely
so
so
i
can
not
say
but
you
did
not
find
my
message
i
shook
my
head
no
i
said
i
did
not
look
in
the
slipper
i
do
not
think
my
friend
did
but
she
that
girl
did
how
could
she
have
believed
ah
grand
i
reverence
your
faith
but
she
is
a
woman
she
loved
you
and
expected
you
that
hour
i
say
thus
comes
the
shock
of
finding
you
untrue
of
finding
you
at
least
a
common
man
after
all
she
is
a
woman
is
the
same
fight
all
the
centuries
after
all
well
i
did
that
you
ruined
the
lives
of
two
neither
of
whom
had
ever
harmed
you
madam
what
is
it
to
the
tree
which
consumes
another
tree
the
flower
which
devours
its
neighbor
was
it
not
life
you
had
never
seen
elisabeth
not
until
the
next
morning
no
then
i
thought
still
on
what
you
had
said
i
envied
her
i
say
i
coveted
the
happiness
of
you
both
what
had
the
world
ever
given
me
what
had
i
done
what
had
i
been
what
could
i
ever
be
your
messenger
came
back
with
the
slipper
the
note
was
in
the
shoe
untouched
your
messenger
had
not
found
it
either
see
i
mean
it
for
you
alone
but
now
since
sudden
thought
came
to
me
i
tucked
it
back
and
sent
your
drunken
friend
away
with
it
for
her
where
i
knew
it
would
be
found
i
did
not
know
what
would
be
the
result
i
was
only
desperate
over
what
life
had
done
to
me
i
wanted
to
get
out
into
a
wider
and
brighter
world
ah
madam
and
was
so
mean
a
key
as
this
to
open
that
world
for
you
now
we
all
three
wander
outside
that
world
no
it
opened
no
new
world
for
me
she
said
i
was
not
meant
for
that
but
at
least
i
only
acted
as
i
have
been
treated
all
my
life
i
knew
no
better
then
i
had
not
thought
any
one
capable
of
that
said
i
ah
but
i
repented
on
the
instant
i
repented
before
night
came
in
the
twilight
i
got
upon
my
knees
and
prayed
that
all
my
plan
might
go
wrong
if
i
could
call
it
plan
i
said
as
the
hour
approached
are
before
the
priest
they
stand
there
she
in
white
perhaps
he
tall
and
grave
their
hands
are
clasped
each
in
that
of
the
other
they
are
saying
those
tremendous
words
which
may
perhaps
mean
so
much
thus
i
ran
on
to
myself
i
say
i
followed
you
through
the
hour
of
that
ceremony
i
swore
with
her
vows
i
pledged
with
her
pledge
promised
with
her
promise
yes
yes
yes
though
i
prayed
that
after
all
i
might
lose
that
i
might
pay
back
that
i
might
some
time
have
opportunity
to
atone
for
my
own
wickedness
ah
i
was
only
a
woman
the
strongest
of
women
are
weak
sometimes
well
then
my
friend
i
have
paid
i
thank
god
that
i
failed
then
to
make
another
wretched
as
myself
it
was
only
i
who
again
was
wretched
ah
is
there
no
little
pity
in
your
heart
for
me
after
all
who
succeeded
only
to
fail
so
miserably
but
again
i
could
only
turn
away
to
ponder
see
she
went
on
for
myself
this
is
irremediable
but
it
is
not
so
for
you
nor
for
her
it
is
not
too
ill
to
be
made
right
again
there
in
montreal
i
thought
that
i
had
failed
in
my
plan
that
you
indeed
were
married
you
held
yourself
well
in
hand
like
a
man
monsieur
but
as
to
that
you
married
for
your
love
for
her
remained
your
pledge
held
and
did
not
i
repenting
marry
you
to
her
did
not
i
on
my
knees
marry
you
to
her
that
night
oh
do
not
blame
me
too
much
she
should
not
have
doubted
said
i
i
shall
not
go
back
and
ask
her
again
the
weakest
of
men
are
strong
sometimes
ah
now
you
are
but
a
man
being
such
you
can
not
understand
how
terribly
much
the
faith
of
man
means
for
a
woman
it
was
her
for
you
that
spoke
not
her
of
you
forgive
her
she
was
not
to
blame
blame
me
do
what
you
like
to
punish
me
now
i
shall
make
amends
tell
me
what
i
best
may
do
shall
i
go
to
her
shall
i
tell
her
not
as
my
messenger
not
for
me
no
well
then
for
myself
that
is
my
right
i
shall
tell
her
how
priestly
faithful
a
man
you
were
i
walked
to
her
took
her
arms
in
my
hands
and
raised
her
to
my
level
looking
into
her
eyes
madam
i
said
god
knows
i
am
no
priest
i
deserve
no
credit
it
was
chance
that
cast
elisabeth
and
me
together
before
ever
i
saw
you
i
told
you
one
fire
was
lit
in
my
heart
and
had
left
room
for
no
other
i
meet
youth
and
life
with
all
that
there
is
in
youth
and
life
i
am
no
priest
and
ask
you
not
to
confess
with
me
we
both
should
confess
to
our
own
souls
it
is
as
i
said
she
went
on
you
were
married
well
then
call
it
so
married
after
my
fashion
of
marriage
the
fashion
of
which
i
told
you
of
a
cabin
and
a
bed
of
husks
as
to
what
you
have
said
i
forget
it
i
have
not
heard
it
your
sort
could
have
no
heart
beat
for
one
like
me
is
men
like
myself
are
slaves
to
women
such
as
you
you
could
never
have
cared
for
me
and
never
did
what
you
loved
madam
was
only
what
you
had
was
only
what
you
saw
in
this
country
was
only
what
this
country
means
your
past
life
of
course
i
do
not
know
sometime
she
murmured
i
will
tell
you
whatever
it
was
madam
you
have
been
a
brilliant
woman
a
power
in
affairs
yes
and
an
enigma
and
to
none
more
than
to
yourself
you
show
that
now
you
only
loved
what
elisabeth
loved
as
woman
then
you
were
born
for
the
first
time
touched
by
that
throb
of
her
heart
not
your
own
mere
accident
i
was
there
to
feel
that
throb
as
sweet
as
it
was
innocent
you
were
not
woman
yet
you
were
but
a
child
you
had
not
then
chosen
you
have
yet
to
choose
it
was
love
that
you
loved
perhaps
after
all
it
was
america
you
loved
you
began
to
see
as
you
say
a
wider
and
a
sweeter
world
than
you
had
known
she
nodded
now
endeavoring
to
smile
i
heard
her
murmur
so
then
i
go
on
madam
and
say
we
are
the
same
i
am
the
agent
of
one
idea
you
of
another
i
ask
you
once
more
to
choose
i
know
how
you
will
choose
she
went
on
musing
to
herself
yes
there
is
a
gulf
between
male
and
female
after
all
as
though
what
he
said
could
be
true
listen
she
spoke
up
more
sharply
if
results
came
as
you
liked
what
difference
would
the
motives
make
how
do
you
mean
only
this
monsieur
that
i
am
not
so
lofty
as
you
think
i
might
do
something
if
so
need
to
be
through
some
motive
wholly
sufficient
to
search
then
your
own
conscience
i
have
one
after
all
it
might
say
something
to
me
yes
once
you
said
to
me
that
the
noblest
thing
in
life
was
to
pass
on
the
torch
of
a
great
principle
i
lied
i
lied
she
cried
beating
her
hands
together
i
am
a
woman
look
at
me
she
threw
back
her
shoulders
standing
straight
and
fearless
god
wot
she
was
a
woman
curves
and
flame
yes
she
was
a
woman
white
flesh
and
slumbering
hair
yes
she
was
a
woman
round
flesh
and
the
purple
scent
arising
yes
she
was
a
woman
torture
of
joy
to
hold
in
a
man
arms
yes
she
was
a
woman
how
then
could
i
believe
she
laid
a
hand
upon
her
bosom
how
then
could
i
believe
that
principle
was
more
than
life
it
is
for
you
a
to
believe
that
yet
even
you
will
not
you
leave
it
to
me
and
i
answer
that
i
will
not
what
i
did
i
did
and
i
bargain
with
none
over
that
now
i
pay
my
wagers
i
make
my
own
reasons
too
if
i
do
anything
for
the
sake
of
this
country
it
will
not
be
through
altruism
not
through
love
of
principle
be
because
i
am
a
woman
yes
once
i
was
a
girl
once
i
was
born
once
even
i
had
a
mother
and
was
loved
i
could
make
no
answer
but
presently
she
changed
again
swift
as
the
sky
when
some
cloud
is
swept
away
in
a
strong
gust
of
wind
come
she
said
i
will
bargain
with
you
after
all
any
bargain
you
like
madam
and
i
will
keep
my
bargain
you
know
that
i
will
yes
i
know
that
very
well
then
i
am
going
back
to
washington
how
do
you
mean
by
land
across
the
country
the
way
you
came
you
do
not
know
what
you
say
madam
the
journey
you
suggest
is
incredible
impossible
that
matters
nothing
i
am
going
and
i
am
going
alone
no
you
can
not
come
with
me
do
you
think
i
would
risk
more
than
i
have
risked
i
go
alone
i
am
england
spy
yes
that
is
true
i
am
to
report
to
england
yes
that
is
true
therefore
the
more
i
see
the
more
i
shall
have
to
report
besides
i
have
something
else
to
do
but
would
pakenham
listen
to
your
report
after
all
now
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
i
can
induce
him
to
listen
she
said
that
is
part
of
my
errand
first
before
i
see
pakenham
i
am
going
to
see
miss
elisabeth
churchill
i
shall
report
also
to
her
then
i
shall
have
done
my
duty
is
it
not
so
you
could
do
no
more
said
i
but
what
bargain
listen
if
she
uses
me
ill
and
will
not
believe
either
you
or
me
then
being
a
woman
i
shall
hate
her
and
in
that
case
i
shall
go
to
sir
richard
for
my
own
revenge
i
shall
tell
him
to
bring
on
this
war
in
that
case
oregon
will
be
lost
to
you
or
at
least
bought
dear
by
blood
and
treasure
we
can
attend
to
that
madam
said
i
grimly
and
i
smiled
at
her
although
a
sudden
fear
caught
at
my
heart
i
knew
what
damage
she
was
in
position
to
accomplish
if
she
liked
my
heart
stood
still
i
felt
the
faint
sweat
again
on
my
forehead
if
i
do
not
find
her
worthy
of
you
then
she
can
not
have
you
went
on
helena
von
ritz
but
madam
you
forget
one
thing
she
worthy
of
me
or
of
any
other
man
i
shall
be
judge
of
that
if
she
is
what
you
think
you
shall
have
her
and
oregon
but
as
to
myself
madam
the
bargain
i
arrive
monsieur
if
she
fails
you
then
i
ask
only
time
i
have
said
to
you
i
am
a
woman
madam
i
said
to
her
once
more
who
are
you
and
what
are
you
in
answer
she
looked
me
once
more
straight
in
the
face
some
day
back
there
after
i
have
made
my
journey
i
shall
tell
you
tell
me
now
i
shall
tell
you
nothing
i
am
not
a
little
girl
there
is
a
bargain
which
i
offer
and
the
only
one
i
shall
offer
it
is
a
gamble
i
have
gambled
all
my
life
if
you
will
not
accord
me
so
remote
a
chance
as
this
why
then
i
shall
take
it
in
any
case
i
begin
to
see
madam
said
i
how
large
these
stakes
may
run
in
case
i
lose
be
sure
at
least
i
shall
pay
i
shall
make
my
atonement
she
said
i
doubt
not
that
madam
with
all
your
heart
and
mind
and
soul
and
she
whispered
the
old
horror
came
again
upon
her
face
she
shuddered
i
did
not
know
why
she
stood
now
as
one
in
devotions
for
a
time
and
i
would
no
more
have
spoken
than
had
she
been
at
her
prayers
as
indeed
i
think
she
was
at
last
she
made
some
faint
movement
of
her
hands
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
the
sign
of
the
cross
she
rose
now
tall
shimmering
a
vision
of
beauty
such
as
that
part
of
the
world
certainly
could
not
then
offer
her
hair
was
loosened
now
in
its
masses
and
drooped
more
widely
over
her
temples
above
her
brow
her
eyes
were
very
large
and
dark
and
i
saw
the
faint
blue
shadows
coming
again
beneath
them
her
hands
were
clasped
her
chin
raised
just
a
trifle
and
her
gaze
was
rapt
as
that
of
some
longing
soul
i
could
not
guess
of
these
things
being
but
a
man
and
i
fear
clumsy
alike
of
body
and
wit
illustration
i
want
said
she
i
wish
i
wish
page
there
is
one
thing
madam
which
we
have
omitted
said
i
at
last
what
are
stakes
how
may
i
pay
she
swayed
a
little
on
her
feet
as
though
she
were
weak
i
want
said
she
i
wish
i
wish
the
old
childlike
look
of
pathos
came
again
i
have
never
seen
so
sad
a
face
she
was
a
lady
white
and
delicately
clad
i
a
rude
frontiersman
in
leather
but
i
stepped
to
her
now
and
took
her
in
my
arms
and
held
her
close
and
pushed
back
the
damp
waves
of
her
hair
and
because
a
man
tears
were
in
my
eyes
i
have
no
doubt
of
absolution
when
i
say
i
had
been
a
cad
and
a
coward
had
i
not
kissed
her
own
tears
away
i
no
longer
made
pretense
of
ignorance
but
ah
how
i
wished
that
i
were
ignorant
of
what
it
was
not
my
right
to
know
i
led
her
to
the
edge
of
the
little
bed
of
husks
and
found
her
kerchief
ah
she
was
of
breeding
and
courage
presently
her
voice
rose
steady
and
clear
as
ever
threlka
she
called
please
when
threlka
came
she
looked
closely
at
her
lady
face
and
what
she
read
seemed
after
all
to
content
her
threlka
said
my
lady
in
french
i
want
the
little
one
i
turned
to
her
with
query
in
my
eyes
she
said
wait
i
have
a
little
surprise
you
have
nothing
at
any
time
save
surprises
madam
two
things
i
have
said
she
sighing
a
little
dog
from
china
chow
by
name
he
sleeps
now
and
i
must
not
disturb
him
else
i
would
show
you
how
lovely
a
dog
is
chow
also
here
i
have
found
a
little
indian
child
running
about
the
post
doctor
mclaughlin
was
rejoiced
when
i
adopted
her
well
then
madam
what
next
yes
with
the
promise
to
him
that
i
would
care
for
that
little
child
i
want
something
for
my
own
see
now
come
natoka
the
old
servant
paused
at
the
door
there
slid
across
the
floor
with
the
silent
feet
of
the
savage
the
tiny
figure
of
a
little
child
perhaps
four
years
of
age
with
hair
and
beady
eyes
clad
in
all
the
bequilled
finery
that
a
could
furnish
a
little
orphan
child
as
i
learned
later
whose
parents
had
both
been
lost
in
a
canoe
accident
at
the
dalles
she
was
an
infant
wild
untrained
unloved
unable
to
speak
a
word
of
the
language
that
she
heard
she
stood
now
hesitating
but
that
was
only
by
reason
of
her
sight
of
me
as
i
stepped
aside
the
little
one
walked
steadily
but
with
quickening
steps
to
my
lady
on
her
couch
of
husks
she
took
up
the
child
in
her
arms
now
there
must
be
some
speech
between
woman
and
child
i
do
not
know
except
that
the
baroness
von
ritz
spoke
and
that
the
child
put
out
a
hand
to
her
cheek
then
as
i
stood
awkward
as
a
clown
myself
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
i
saw
tears
rain
again
from
the
eyes
of
helena
von
ritz
so
that
i
turned
away
even
as
i
saw
her
cheek
laid
to
that
of
the
child
while
she
clasped
it
tight
monsieur
i
heard
her
say
at
last
i
did
not
answer
i
was
learning
a
bit
of
life
myself
this
night
i
was
years
older
than
when
i
had
come
through
that
door
monsieur
i
heard
her
call
yet
again
madam
i
replied
lightly
as
i
could
and
so
turned
giving
her
all
possible
time
i
saw
her
holding
the
indian
child
out
in
front
of
her
in
her
strong
young
arms
lightly
as
though
the
weight
were
nothing
see
then
she
said
here
is
my
companion
across
the
mountains
again
i
began
to
expostulate
but
now
she
tapped
her
foot
impatiently
in
her
old
way
you
have
heard
me
say
it
very
well
follow
if
you
like
listen
also
if
you
like
in
a
day
or
so
doctor
mclaughlin
plans
a
party
for
us
all
far
up
the
columbia
to
the
missions
at
wailatpu
that
is
in
the
valley
of
the
walla
walla
they
tell
me
just
at
this
edge
of
the
blue
mountains
where
the
wagon
trains
come
down
into
this
part
of
oregon
they
may
not
see
the
wagon
trains
so
soon
i
ventured
they
would
scarcely
arrive
before
october
and
now
it
is
but
summer
at
least
these
british
officers
would
see
a
part
of
this
country
do
you
not
comprehend
we
start
within
three
days
at
least
i
wish
only
to
say
that
perhaps
ah
i
will
be
there
surely
madam
if
you
come
independently
i
have
heard
however
that
one
of
the
missionary
women
wishes
to
go
back
to
the
states
i
have
thought
that
perhaps
it
might
be
better
did
we
go
together
also
natoka
also
chow
does
doctor
mclaughlin
know
of
your
plans
i
am
not
under
his
orders
monsieur
i
only
thought
that
since
you
were
used
to
this
western
travel
you
could
perhaps
be
of
aid
in
getting
me
proper
guides
and
vehicles
i
should
rely
upon
your
judgment
very
much
monsieur
you
are
asking
me
to
aid
you
in
your
own
folly
said
i
discontentedly
but
i
will
be
there
and
be
sure
also
you
can
not
prevent
me
from
following
if
you
persist
in
this
absolute
folly
a
woman
to
cross
the
rockies
i
rose
now
and
she
was
gracious
enough
to
follow
me
part
way
toward
the
door
we
hesitated
there
awkwardly
enough
but
once
more
our
hands
met
in
some
sort
of
fellowship
forget
i
heard
her
whisper
and
i
could
think
of
no
reply
better
than
that
same
word
i
turned
as
the
door
swung
for
me
to
pass
out
into
the
night
i
saw
her
outlined
against
the
lights
within
tall
and
white
in
her
arms
the
indian
child
whose
cheek
was
pressed
to
her
own
i
do
not
concern
myself
with
what
others
may
say
of
conduct
or
of
constancy
to
me
it
seemed
that
had
i
not
made
my
homage
my
reverence
to
one
after
all
so
brave
as
she
i
would
not
be
worthy
the
cover
of
that
flag
which
floats
both
on
the
columbia
and
the
rio
grande
chapter
xxviii
when
a
woman
would
the
two
pleasantest
days
of
a
woman
are
her
marriage
day
and
the
day
of
her
my
garden
at
the
willamette
might
languish
if
it
liked
and
my
little
cabin
might
stand
in
uncut
wheat
for
me
there
were
other
matters
of
more
importance
now
i
took
leave
of
hospitable
doctor
mclaughlin
at
fort
vancouver
with
proper
expressions
of
the
obligation
due
for
his
hospitality
but
i
said
nothing
to
him
of
course
of
having
met
the
mysterious
baroness
nor
did
i
mention
definitely
that
i
intended
to
meet
them
both
again
at
no
distant
date
none
the
less
i
prepared
to
set
out
at
once
up
the
columbia
river
trail
from
fort
vancouver
to
the
missions
at
wailatpu
was
a
distance
by
trail
of
more
than
two
hundred
miles
this
i
covered
horseback
rapidly
and
arrived
two
or
three
days
in
advance
of
the
english
nothing
disturbed
the
quiet
until
before
noon
of
one
day
we
heard
the
gun
fire
and
the
shoutings
which
in
that
country
customarily
made
announcement
of
the
arrival
of
a
party
of
travelers
being
on
the
lookout
for
these
i
soon
discovered
them
to
be
my
late
friends
of
the
hudson
bay
post
one
old
brown
woman
unhappily
astride
a
native
pony
i
took
to
be
threlka
my
lady
servant
but
she
rode
with
her
class
at
the
rear
i
looked
again
until
i
found
the
baroness
clad
in
buckskins
and
blue
cloth
brave
as
any
in
finery
of
the
frontier
doctor
mclaughlin
saw
fit
to
present
us
formally
or
rather
carelessly
it
not
seeming
to
him
that
two
so
different
would
meet
often
in
the
future
and
of
course
there
being
no
dream
even
in
his
shrewd
mind
that
we
had
ever
met
in
the
past
this
supposition
fitted
our
plans
even
though
it
kept
us
apart
i
was
but
a
common
emigrant
farmer
camping
like
my
kind
she
being
of
distinction
dwelt
with
the
hudson
bay
party
in
the
mission
buildings
we
lived
on
here
for
a
week
visiting
back
and
forth
in
amity
as
i
must
say
i
grew
to
like
well
enough
those
blunt
young
fellows
of
the
navy
with
young
lieutenant
peel
especially
i
struck
up
something
of
a
friendship
if
he
remained
hopelessly
british
at
least
i
presume
i
remained
quite
as
hopelessly
american
so
that
we
came
to
set
aside
the
topic
of
conversation
on
which
we
could
not
agree
there
is
something
about
which
you
do
know
he
said
to
me
one
evening
i
am
wholly
unacquainted
with
the
interior
of
your
country
what
would
you
say
for
instance
regarding
its
safety
for
a
lady
traveling
across
a
small
party
you
know
of
her
own
i
presume
of
course
you
know
whom
i
mean
i
nodded
you
must
mean
the
baroness
von
ritz
yes
she
has
been
traveling
abroad
of
course
we
took
such
care
of
her
on
shipboard
as
we
could
although
a
lady
has
no
place
on
board
a
warship
she
had
with
her
complete
furnishings
for
a
suite
of
apartments
and
these
were
delivered
ashore
at
fort
vancouver
doctor
mclaughlin
gave
her
quarters
of
course
you
do
not
know
anything
of
this
i
allowed
him
to
proceed
well
she
has
told
us
calmly
that
she
plans
crossing
this
country
from
here
to
the
eastern
states
that
could
not
possibly
be
i
declared
quite
so
the
old
trappers
tell
me
that
the
mountains
are
impassable
even
in
the
fall
they
say
that
unless
she
met
some
train
and
came
back
with
it
the
chance
would
be
that
she
would
never
be
heard
of
again
you
have
personal
interest
in
this
i
interrupted
he
nodded
flushing
a
little
awfully
so
said
he
i
would
have
the
right
to
guess
you
were
hit
pretty
hard
to
the
extent
of
asking
her
to
become
my
wife
said
he
firmly
although
his
fair
face
flushed
again
you
do
not
in
the
least
know
her
he
went
on
in
my
case
i
have
done
my
turn
at
living
and
have
seen
my
share
of
women
but
never
her
like
in
any
part
of
the
world
so
when
she
proposed
to
make
this
absurd
journey
i
offered
to
go
with
her
it
meant
of
course
my
desertion
from
the
navy
and
so
i
told
her
she
would
not
listen
to
it
she
gives
me
no
footing
which
leaves
it
possible
for
me
to
accompany
her
or
to
follow
her
frankly
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
it
seems
to
me
lieutenant
peel
i
ventured
that
the
most
sensible
thing
in
the
world
for
us
to
do
is
to
get
together
an
expedition
to
follow
her
he
caught
me
by
the
hand
you
do
not
tell
me
would
do
that
it
seems
a
duty
but
could
you
yourself
get
through
as
to
that
no
one
can
tell
i
did
so
coming
west
he
sat
silent
for
a
time
it
will
be
the
last
i
shall
ever
see
of
her
in
any
case
said
he
at
length
we
do
know
how
long
it
will
be
before
we
leave
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
and
then
i
could
not
count
on
finding
her
you
do
not
think
me
a
fool
for
telling
you
what
i
have
no
said
i
i
do
not
blame
you
for
being
a
fool
all
men
who
are
men
are
fools
over
women
one
time
or
other
good
luck
to
you
then
now
what
shall
we
do
in
the
first
place
said
i
if
she
insists
upon
going
let
us
give
her
every
possible
chance
for
success
it
looks
an
awfully
slender
chance
he
sighed
you
will
follow
as
close
on
their
heels
as
you
can
of
that
you
may
rest
assured
what
is
the
distance
do
you
think
two
thousand
miles
at
least
before
she
could
be
safe
she
could
not
hope
to
cover
more
than
miles
a
day
many
days
not
so
much
as
that
to
be
sure
there
might
be
such
a
thing
as
her
meeting
wagons
coming
out
and
as
you
say
she
might
return
you
do
not
know
her
said
he
she
will
not
turn
back
i
had
full
reason
to
agree
with
him
chapter
xxix
in
exchange
great
women
belong
to
history
and
to
for
sufficient
reasons
of
my
own
which
have
been
explained
i
did
not
care
to
mingle
more
than
was
necessary
with
the
party
of
the
hudson
bay
folk
who
made
their
quarters
with
the
missionary
families
i
kept
close
to
my
own
camp
when
not
busy
with
my
inquiries
in
the
neighborhood
where
i
now
began
to
see
what
could
be
done
in
the
preparation
of
a
proper
outfit
for
the
baroness
herself
i
did
not
see
for
the
next
two
days
but
one
evening
i
met
her
on
the
narrow
log
gallery
of
one
of
the
mission
houses
without
much
speech
we
sat
and
looked
over
the
pleasant
prospect
of
the
wide
flats
the
fringe
of
willow
trees
the
loom
of
the
mountains
off
toward
the
east
continually
you
surprise
me
madam
i
began
at
last
can
we
not
persuade
you
to
abandon
this
foolish
plan
of
your
going
east
i
see
no
reason
for
abandoning
it
said
she
there
are
some
thousands
of
your
people
men
women
and
children
who
have
crossed
that
trail
why
should
not
i
but
they
come
in
large
parties
they
come
well
prepared
each
helps
his
neighbor
the
distance
is
the
same
and
the
method
is
the
same
i
ceased
to
argue
seeing
that
she
would
not
be
persuaded
at
least
madam
said
i
i
have
done
what
little
i
could
in
securing
you
a
party
you
are
to
have
eight
mules
two
carts
six
horses
and
two
men
beside
old
joe
meek
the
best
guide
now
in
oregon
he
would
not
go
to
save
his
life
he
goes
to
save
yours
you
are
always
efficient
said
she
but
why
is
it
that
we
always
have
some
unpleasant
argument
come
let
us
have
tea
many
teas
together
madam
if
you
would
listen
to
me
many
a
pot
brewed
deep
and
black
by
scores
of
fie
monsieur
proposes
a
scandal
no
monsieur
proposes
only
a
journey
to
washington
with
you
or
close
after
you
of
course
i
can
not
prevent
your
following
she
said
leave
it
so
but
as
to
pledges
at
least
i
want
to
keep
my
little
slipper
is
madam
wardrobe
with
her
could
she
humor
a
peevish
friend
so
much
as
that
come
now
i
will
make
fair
exchange
i
will
trade
you
again
my
blanket
clasp
for
that
one
little
shoe
i
felt
in
the
pocket
of
my
coat
and
held
out
in
my
hand
the
remnants
of
the
same
little
indian
ornament
which
had
figured
between
us
the
first
night
we
had
met
she
grasped
at
it
eagerly
turning
it
over
in
her
hand
but
see
she
said
one
of
the
clasps
is
gone
yes
i
parted
with
it
but
come
do
i
have
my
little
slipper
wait
said
she
and
left
me
for
a
moment
presently
she
returned
laughing
with
the
little
white
satin
foot
covering
in
her
hand
i
warrant
it
is
the
only
thing
of
the
sort
ever
was
seen
in
these
buildings
she
went
on
alas
i
fear
i
must
leave
most
of
my
possessions
here
i
have
already
disposed
of
the
furnishings
of
my
apartment
to
james
douglas
at
fort
vancouver
i
hear
he
is
to
replace
this
good
doctor
mclaughlin
well
his
wife
will
at
least
have
good
setting
up
for
her
household
tell
me
now
she
concluded
what
became
of
the
other
shell
from
this
clasp
i
gave
it
to
an
old
man
in
montreal
i
answered
i
went
on
to
show
her
the
nature
of
the
device
as
it
had
been
explained
to
me
by
old
doctor
von
rittenhofen
how
curious
she
mused
as
it
became
more
plain
to
her
life
love
eternity
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
all
this
turmoil
about
passing
on
the
torch
of
life
it
is
old
old
is
it
not
tell
me
who
was
the
wise
man
who
described
all
this
to
you
not
a
stranger
to
this
very
country
i
imagine
was
my
answer
he
spent
some
years
here
in
oregon
with
the
missionaries
engaged
as
he
informed
me
in
classifying
the
butterflies
of
this
new
region
a
german
scientist
i
think
and
seemingly
a
man
of
breeding
if
i
were
left
to
guess
she
broke
out
suddenly
i
would
say
it
must
have
been
this
same
old
man
who
told
you
about
the
plans
of
the
canadian
land
expedition
to
this
country
continually
madam
we
find
much
in
common
at
least
we
both
know
that
the
canadian
expedition
started
west
tell
me
when
will
it
arrive
on
the
columbia
it
will
never
arrive
it
will
never
cross
the
rockies
word
has
gone
up
the
columbia
now
that
for
these
men
to
appear
in
this
country
would
bring
on
immediate
war
that
does
not
suit
the
book
of
england
more
than
it
does
that
of
america
then
the
matter
will
wait
until
you
see
mr
pakenham
she
nodded
i
suppose
so
you
will
find
facts
enough
should
you
persist
in
your
mad
journey
and
get
far
enough
to
the
east
you
will
see
two
thousand
three
thousand
men
coming
out
to
oregon
this
fall
it
is
but
the
beginning
but
you
and
i
sitting
here
three
thousand
miles
and
more
away
from
washington
can
determine
this
question
madam
perhaps
yet
you
may
win
your
right
to
some
humble
home
with
a
couch
of
husks
or
straw
sleep
then
by
our
across
america
and
let
our
skies
cover
you
at
night
our
men
will
watch
over
you
faithfully
be
our
guest
our
friend
you
are
a
good
special
pleader
said
she
but
you
do
not
shake
me
in
my
purpose
and
i
hold
to
my
terms
it
does
not
rest
with
you
and
me
but
with
another
as
i
have
told
you
as
we
have
both
agreed
then
let
us
not
speak
her
name
said
i
again
her
eyes
looked
into
mine
straight
large
and
dark
again
the
spell
of
her
beauty
rose
all
around
me
enveloped
me
as
i
had
felt
it
do
before
you
can
not
have
oregon
except
through
me
she
said
at
last
you
can
not
have
her
except
through
me
it
is
the
truth
i
answered
in
god
name
then
play
the
game

counter
currents
woman
is
like
the
reed
that
bends
to
every

but
breaks
not
in
the
richard
the
oregon
immigration
for
numbered
according
to
some
accounts
not
less
than
three
thousand
souls
our
people
still
rolled
westward
in
a
mighty
wave
the
history
of
that
great
movement
is
well
known
the
story
of
a
yet
more
decisive
journey
of
that
same
year
never
has
been
written
that
of
helena
von
ritz
from
oregon
to
the
east
the
price
of
that
journey
was
an
empire
its
cost
ah
let
me
not
yet
speak
of
that
although
meek
and
i
agreed
that
he
should
push
east
at
the
best
possible
speed
it
was
well
enough
understood
that
i
should
give
him
no
more
than
a
day
or
so
start
i
did
not
purpose
to
allow
so
risky
a
journey
as
this
to
be
undertaken
by
any
woman
in
so
small
a
party
and
made
no
doubt
that
i
would
overtake
them
at
least
at
fort
hall
perhaps
five
hundred
miles
east
of
the
missions
or
at
farthest
at
fort
bridger
some
seven
hundred
miles
from
the
starting
point
in
oregon
the
young
wife
of
one
of
the
missionaries
was
glad
enough
to
take
passage
thus
for
the
east
and
there
was
the
silent
threlka
those
two
could
offer
company
even
did
not
the
little
indian
maid
adopted
by
the
baroness
serve
to
interest
her
their
equipment
and
supplies
were
as
good
as
any
purchasable
what
could
be
done
we
now
had
done
yet
after
all
helena
von
ritz
had
her
own
way
i
did
not
see
her
again
after
we
parted
that
evening
at
the
mission
i
was
absent
for
a
couple
of
days
with
a
hunting
party
and
on
my
return
discovered
that
she
was
gone
with
no
more
than
brief
farewell
to
those
left
behind
meek
was
anxious
as
herself
to
be
off
but
he
left
word
for
me
to
follow
on
at
once
gloom
now
fell
upon
us
all
doctor
whitman
the
only
white
man
ever
to
make
the
journey
from
oregon
encouraged
us
as
best
he
could
but
young
lieutenant
peel
was
the
picture
of
despair
nor
did
he
indeed
fail
in
the
prophecy
he
made
to
me
for
never
again
did
he
set
eyes
on
the
face
of
helena
von
ritz
and
never
again
did
i
meet
him
i
heard
years
later
that
he
died
of
fever
on
the
china
coast
it
may
be
supposed
that
i
myself
now
hurried
in
my
plans
i
was
able
to
make
up
a
small
party
of
four
men
about
half
the
number
meek
took
with
him
and
i
threw
together
such
equipment
as
i
could
find
remaining
not
wholly
to
my
liking
but
good
enough
i
fancied
to
overtake
a
party
headed
by
a
woman
but
one
thing
after
another
cost
us
time
and
we
did
not
average
twenty
miles
a
day
i
felt
half
desperate
as
i
reflected
on
what
this
might
mean
as
early
fall
was
approaching
i
could
expect
in
view
of
my
own
lost
time
to
encounter
the
annual
wagon
train
two
or
three
hundred
miles
farther
westward
than
the
object
of
my
pursuit
naturally
would
have
done
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
party
met
the
wagons
at
a
point
well
to
the
west
of
fort
hall
it
was
early
in
the
morning
we
met
them
coming
west
that
long
weary
creeping
caravan
a
mile
long
slow
serpent
crawling
westward
across
the
desert
in
time
i
came
up
to
the
head
of
the
tremendous
wagon
train
of
and
its
leader
and
myself
threw
up
our
hands
in
the
salutation
of
the
wilderness
the
leader
command
to
halt
was
passed
back
from
one
wagon
to
another
over
more
than
a
mile
of
trail
as
we
dismounted
there
came
hurrying
up
about
us
men
and
women
sunburned
lean
ragged
abandoning
their
wagons
and
crowding
to
hear
the
news
from
oregon
i
recall
the
picture
well
enough
the
sands
all
about
the
short
and
scraggly
the
long
line
of
wagons
dwindling
in
the
distance
the
figures
which
crowded
about
the
captain
stood
at
the
head
of
the
front
team
his
hand
resting
on
the
yoke
as
he
leaned
against
the
bowed
neck
of
one
of
the
oxen
the
men
and
women
were
thin
almost
as
the
beasts
which
dragged
the
wagons
these
latter
stood
with
lolling
tongues
even
thus
early
in
the
day
for
water
hereabout
was
scarce
and
bitter
to
the
taste
so
at
first
almost
in
silence
we
made
the
salutations
of
the
desert
so
presently
we
exchanged
the
news
of
east
and
west
so
i
saw
again
my
canvas
of
the
fierce
there
is
no
news
of
the
quality
which
we
then
communicated
these
knew
nothing
of
oregon
i
knew
nothing
of
the
east
a
national
election
had
been
held
regarding
which
i
knew
not
even
the
names
of
the
candidates
of
either
party
not
to
mention
the
results
all
i
could
do
was
to
guess
and
to
point
to
the
inscription
on
the
white
top
of
the
foremost
wagon
forty
or
fight
is
polk
elected
i
asked
the
captain
of
the
train
he
nodded
he
shore
is
said
he
we
comin
out
to
take
oregon
what
the
news
my
own
grim
news
was
that
oregon
was
ours
and
must
be
ours
i
shook
hands
with
a
hundred
men
on
that
our
hands
clasped
in
stern
and
silent
grip
then
after
a
time
i
urged
other
questions
foremost
in
my
own
mind
had
they
seen
a
small
party
yes
i
had
answer
they
had
passed
this
light
outfit
east
of
post
there
was
one
chance
in
a
hundred
they
might
get
over
the
south
pass
that
fall
for
they
were
traveling
light
and
fast
with
good
animals
and
old
joe
meek
was
sure
he
would
make
it
through
the
women
well
one
was
a
preacher
wife
another
an
old
gipsy
and
another
the
most
beautiful
woman
ever
seen
on
the
trail
or
anywhere
else
why
was
she
going
east
instead
of
west
away
from
oregon
instead
of
to
oregon
did
i
know
any
of
them
i
was
following
them
then
i
must
hurry
for
soon
the
snow
would
come
in
the
rockies
they
had
seen
no
indians
well
if
i
was
following
them
there
would
be
a
race
and
they
wished
me
well
but
why
go
east
instead
of
west
then
they
began
to
question
me
regarding
oregon
how
was
the
land
would
it
raise
wheat
and
corn
and
hogs
how
was
the
weather
was
there
much
game
would
it
take
much
labor
to
clear
a
farm
was
there
any
likelihood
of
trouble
with
the
indians
or
with
the
britishers
could
a
man
really
get
a
mile
square
of
good
farm
land
without
trouble
and
so
on
and
so
on
as
we
sat
in
the
blinding
sun
in
the
desert
until
midday
of
course
it
came
to
politics
yes
texas
had
been
annexed
somehow
not
by
regular
vote
of
the
senate
there
was
some
hitch
about
that
my
leader
reckoned
there
was
no
regular
treaty
it
had
just
been
done
by
joint
resolution
of
the
house
done
by
tyler
and
calhoun
just
in
time
to
take
the
feather
out
of
old
polk
cap
the
treaty
of
annexation
why
yes
it
was
ratified
by
congress
and
everything
signed
up
march
third
just
one
day
before
polk
inaugural
polk
was
on
the
warpath
according
to
my
gaunt
leader
there
was
going
to
be
war
as
sure
as
shooting
unless
we
got
all
of
oregon
we
had
offered
great
britain
a
fair
show
and
in
return
she
had
claimed
everything
south
to
the
columbia
so
now
we
had
withdrawn
all
soft
talk
it
looked
like
war
with
mexico
and
england
both
never
mind
in
that
case
we
would
whip
them
both
do
you
see
that
writin
on
my
wagon
top
asked
the
captain
forty
or
that
us
and
so
they
went
on
to
tell
us
how
this
cry
was
spreading
south
and
west
and
over
the
north
as
well
although
the
whigs
did
not
dare
cry
it
quite
so
loudly
they
want
the
just
the
same
said
the
captain
we
want
it
an
by
god
we
goin
to
git
it
and
so
at
last
we
parted
each
the
better
for
the
information
gained
each
to
resume
what
would
seem
practically
an
endless
journey
our
farewells
were
as
careless
as
confident
as
had
been
our
greetings
thousands
of
miles
of
unsettled
country
lay
east
and
west
of
us
and
all
around
us
our
empire
not
then
won
history
tells
how
that
wagon
train
went
through
and
how
its
settlers
scattered
all
along
the
willamette
and
the
columbia
and
the
walla
walla
and
helped
us
to
hold
oregon
for
myself
the
chapter
of
accidents
continued
i
was
detained
at
fort
hall
and
again
east
of
there
i
met
straggling
immigrants
coming
on
across
the
south
pass
to
winter
at
bridger
post
but
finally
i
lost
all
word
of
meek
party
and
could
only
suppose
that
they
had
got
over
the
mountains
i
made
the
journey
across
the
south
pass
the
snow
being
now
beaten
down
on
the
trails
more
than
usual
by
the
animals
and
vehicles
of
all
these
now
coming
on
none
would
get
farther
west
than
fort
hall
that
year
our
own
party
although
over
the
rockies
had
yet
the
plains
to
cross
i
was
glad
enough
when
we
staggered
into
old
fort
laramie
in
the
midst
of
a
blinding
winter
had
caught
us
fair
and
full
i
had
lost
the
race
here
then
i
must
winter
yet
i
learned
that
joe
meek
had
outfitted
at
laramie
almost
a
month
earlier
with
new
animals
had
bought
a
little
grain
and
under
escort
of
a
cavalry
troop
which
had
come
west
with
the
wagon
train
had
started
east
in
time
perhaps
to
make
it
through
to
the
missouri
in
a
race
of
one
thousand
miles
the
baroness
had
already
beaten
me
almost
by
a
month
further
word
was
of
course
now
unobtainable
for
no
trains
or
wagons
would
come
west
so
late
and
there
were
then
no
stages
carrying
mail
across
the
great
plains
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
except
to
wait
and
eat
out
my
heart
at
old
fort
laramie
in
the
society
of
indians
and
trappers
and
traders
the
winter
seemed
years
in
length
so
gladly
i
make
its
story
brief
it
was
now
the
spring
of
and
i
was
in
my
second
year
away
from
washington
glad
enough
i
was
when
in
the
first
sunshine
of
spring
i
started
east
taking
my
chances
of
getting
over
the
plains
at
last
to
make
the
long
journey
also
brief
i
did
reach
fort
leavenworth
by
this
time
a
five
months
loser
in
the
transcontinental
race
it
was
a
new
annual
wagon
train
which
i
now
met
rolling
westward
such
were
times
and
travel
not
so
long
ago
little
enough
had
come
of
my
two
years
journey
out
to
oregon
like
to
the
army
of
the
french
king
i
had
marched
up
the
hill
and
then
marched
down
again
as
much
might
have
been
said
of
the
united
states
and
the
same
was
yet
more
true
of
great
britain
whose
army
of
occupation
had
not
even
marched
wholly
up
the
hill
so
much
as
this
latter
fact
i
now
could
tell
my
own
government
and
i
could
say
that
while
great
fleet
held
the
sea
entry
the
vast
and
splendid
interior
of
an
unknown
realm
was
open
on
the
east
to
our
marching
armies
of
settlers
now
i
could
describe
that
realm
even
though
the
plot
of
events
advanced
but
slowly
regarding
it
it
was
a
plot
of
the
stars
whose
work
is
done
in
no
haste
oregon
still
was
held
in
that
oft
renewed
and
wholly
absurd
joint
occupancy
so
odious
and
so
dangerous
to
both
nations
two
years
were
taken
from
my
life
in
learning
that
and
in
learning
that
this
question
of
oregon
final
ownership
was
to
be
decided
not
on
the
pacific
not
on
the
shoulders
of
the
blues
or
the
cascades
but
in
the
east
there
at
washington
after
all
the
actual
issue
was
in
the
hands
of
the
god
of
battles
who
sometimes
uses
strange
instruments
for
his
ends
it
was
not
i
it
was
not
calhoun
not
any
of
the
officers
of
our
government
who
could
get
oregon
for
us
it
was
the
god
of
battles
whose
instrument
was
a
woman
helena
von
ritz
after
all
this
was
the
chief
fruit
of
my
long
journey
as
to
the
baroness
she
had
long
since
left
fort
leavenworth
for
the
east
i
followed
still
with
what
speed
i
could
employ
i
could
not
reach
washington
now
until
long
after
the
first
buds
would
be
out
and
the
creepers
growing
green
on
the
gallery
of
calhoun
residence
yes
green
also
on
all
the
lattices
of
elmhurst
mansion
what
had
happened
there
for
me
chapter
xxxi
the
payment
what
man
seeks
in
love
is
woman
what
woman
seeks
in
man
is
when
i
reached
washington
it
was
indeed
spring
warm
sweet
spring
in
the
wide
avenues
the
straggling
trees
were
doing
their
best
to
dignify
the
city
and
flowers
were
blooming
everywhere
wonderful
enough
did
all
this
seem
to
me
after
thousands
of
miles
of
rude
scenery
of
bare
valleys
and
rocky
hills
wild
landscapes
seen
often
through
cold
and
blinding
storms
amid
peaks
and
gorges
or
on
the
drear
forbidding
plains
used
more
of
late
to
these
wilder
scenes
i
felt
awkward
and
still
half
savage
i
did
not
at
once
seek
out
my
own
friends
my
first
wish
was
to
get
in
touch
with
calhoun
for
i
knew
that
so
i
would
most
quickly
arrive
at
the
heart
of
events
he
was
away
when
i
called
at
his
residence
on
georgetown
heights
but
at
last
i
heard
the
wheels
of
his
old
omnibus
and
presently
he
entered
with
his
usual
companion
doctor
samuel
ward
when
they
saw
me
there
then
indeed
i
received
a
greeting
which
repaid
me
for
many
things
this
over
we
all
three
broke
out
in
laughter
at
my
uncouth
appearance
i
was
clad
still
in
such
clothing
as
i
could
pick
up
in
western
towns
as
i
hurried
on
from
the
missouri
eastward
and
i
had
as
yet
found
no
time
for
barbers
we
have
had
no
word
from
you
nicholas
said
calhoun
presently
since
that
from
laramie
in
the
fall
of
eighteen
this
is
in
the
spring
of
eighteen
meantime
we
might
all
have
been
dead
and
buried
and
none
of
us
the
wiser
what
a
country
is
more
enormous
than
the
mind
of
any
of
us
can
grasp
you
should
travel
across
it
to
learn
that
i
grinned
many
things
have
happened
since
you
left
you
know
that
i
am
back
in
the
senate
once
more
i
nodded
and
about
texas
i
began
texas
is
ours
said
he
smiling
grimly
you
have
heard
how
it
was
a
hard
fight
enough
a
bitter
selfish
sectional
fight
among
politicians
but
there
is
going
to
be
war
our
troops
crossed
the
sabine
more
than
a
year
ago
they
will
cross
the
rio
grande
before
this
year
is
done
the
mexican
minister
has
asked
for
his
passports
the
administration
has
ordered
general
taylor
to
advance
polk
is
carrying
out
annexation
with
a
vengeance
seeing
a
chance
for
more
territory
now
that
texas
is
safe
from
england
he
plans
war
on
helpless
and
deserted
mexico
we
may
hear
of
a
battle
now
at
any
time
but
this
war
with
mexico
may
yet
mean
war
with
england
that
of
course
endangers
our
chance
to
gain
all
or
any
of
that
great
oregon
country
tell
me
what
have
you
learned
i
hurried
on
now
with
my
own
news
briefly
as
i
might
i
told
them
of
the
ships
of
england
navy
waiting
in
oregon
waters
of
the
growing
suspicion
of
the
hudson
bay
people
of
the
changes
in
the
management
at
fort
vancouver
of
the
change
also
from
a
conciliatory
policy
to
one
of
half
hostility
i
told
them
of
our
wagon
trains
going
west
and
of
the
strength
of
our
frontiersmen
but
offset
this
justly
as
i
might
by
giving
facts
also
regarding
the
opposition
these
might
meet
precisely
said
calhoun
walking
up
and
down
his
head
bent
england
is
prepared
for
war
how
much
are
we
prepared
it
would
cost
us
the
revenues
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
to
go
to
war
with
her
it
would
cost
us
fifty
thousand
lives
we
would
need
an
army
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
where
is
all
that
to
come
from
can
we
transport
our
army
there
in
time
but
had
all
this
bluster
ceased
then
we
could
have
deferred
this
war
with
mexico
could
have
bought
with
coin
what
now
will
cost
us
blood
and
we
could
also
have
bought
oregon
without
the
cost
of
either
coin
or
blood
was
what
we
needed
of
oregon
should
have
been
ours
but
surely
this
is
not
all
news
to
you
i
began
have
you
not
seen
the
baroness
von
ritz
has
she
not
made
her
report
the
baroness
queried
calhoun
that
stormy
petrel
that
advance
agent
of
events
did
she
indeed
sail
with
the
british
ships
from
montreal
you
find
her
there
in
oregon
yes
and
lost
her
there
she
started
east
last
summer
and
beat
me
fairly
in
the
race
has
she
not
made
known
her
presence
here
she
told
me
she
was
going
to
washington
he
shook
his
head
in
surprise
trouble
now
i
fear
pakenham
has
back
his
best
ally
our
worst
antagonist
that
certainly
is
strange
said
i
she
had
five
months
the
start
of
me
and
in
that
time
there
is
no
telling
what
she
has
done
or
undone
surely
she
is
somewhere
here
in
washington
she
held
texas
in
her
shoes
i
tell
you
she
holds
oregon
in
her
gloves
i
started
up
my
story
half
untold
where
are
you
going
asked
calhoun
of
me
doctor
ward
looked
at
me
smiling
he
does
not
inquire
of
a
certain
young
lady
i
am
going
to
find
the
baroness
von
ritz
said
i
flushed
red
under
my
tan
i
doubt
not
but
i
would
not
ask
a
word
regarding
elisabeth
doctor
ward
came
and
laid
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
republics
forget
said
he
but
men
from
south
carolina
do
not
neither
do
girls
from
maryland
do
you
think
so
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
find
out
how
then
are
you
going
to
elmhurst
as
you
look
now
no
i
shall
find
out
many
things
by
first
finding
the
baroness
von
ritz
and
before
they
could
make
further
protests
i
was
out
and
away
i
hurried
now
to
a
certain
side
street
of
which
i
have
made
mention
and
knocked
confidently
at
a
door
i
knew
the
neighborhood
was
asleep
in
the
warm
sun
i
knocked
a
second
time
and
began
to
doubt
but
at
last
heard
slow
footsteps
there
appeared
at
the
crack
of
the
door
the
wrinkled
visage
of
the
old
threlka
i
knew
that
she
would
be
there
in
precisely
this
way
because
there
was
every
reason
in
the
world
why
it
should
not
have
been
she
paused
scanning
me
closely
then
quickly
opened
the
door
and
allowed
me
to
step
inside
vanishing
as
was
her
wont
i
heard
another
step
in
a
hallway
beyond
but
this
was
not
the
step
which
i
awaited
it
was
that
of
a
man
slow
feeble
hesitating
i
started
forward
as
a
face
appeared
at
the
parted
curtains
a
glad
cry
welcomed
me
in
turn
a
tall
bent
form
approached
me
and
an
arm
was
thrown
about
my
shoulder
it
was
my
whilom
friend
our
ancient
scientist
von
rittenhofen
i
did
not
pause
to
ask
how
he
happened
to
be
there
it
was
quite
natural
since
it
was
wholly
impossible
i
made
no
wonder
at
the
chinese
dog
chow
or
the
little
indian
maid
who
both
came
stared
and
silently
vanished
seeing
these
i
knew
that
their
strange
protector
must
also
have
won
through
safe
gott
gesegneter
gott
i
see
you
again
my
friend
thus
the
old
doctor
but
tell
me
i
interrupted
where
is
the
mistress
of
this
house
the
baroness
von
ritz
he
looked
at
me
in
his
mild
way
you
mean
my
daughter
helena
now
at
last
i
smiled
his
daughter
this
at
least
was
too
incredible
he
turned
and
reached
behind
him
to
a
little
table
he
held
up
before
my
eyes
my
little
blanket
clasp
of
shell
then
i
knew
that
this
last
and
most
impossible
thing
also
was
true
and
that
in
some
way
these
two
had
found
each
other
but
what
could
he
now
mean
listen
now
he
began
and
i
shall
tell
you
i
wass
in
the
street
one
day
when
i
walk
alone
i
do
not
much
notice
but
now
as
i
walk
before
my
eyes
on
the
street
i
see
what
this
this
the
tah
gook
at
first
i
see
nothing
but
it
then
i
look
up
before
me
iss
a
woman
young
and
beautiful
ach
what
should
i
do
but
take
her
in
my
arms
it
was
she
it
was
my
daughter
yess
my
daughter
it
iss
i
haf
not
seen
her
for
many
years
long
cruel
years
i
suppose
her
dead
but
now
there
we
were
standing
looking
in
each
other
eyes
we
see
there
ach
gott
what
do
we
not
see
yet
in
spite
of
all
it
wass
helena
but
she
shall
tell
you
he
tottered
from
the
room
i
heard
his
footsteps
pass
down
the
hall
then
softly
almost
silently
helena
von
ritz
again
stood
before
me
the
light
from
a
side
window
fell
upon
her
face
yes
it
was
she
her
face
was
thinner
now
browner
even
than
was
its
wont
her
hair
was
still
faintly
sunburned
at
its
extremities
by
the
western
winds
yet
hers
was
still
imperishable
youth
and
beauty
i
held
out
my
hands
to
her
ah
i
cried
you
played
me
false
you
ran
away
by
what
miracle
did
you
come
through
i
confess
my
defeat
you
beat
me
by
almost
half
a
year
but
now
you
have
come
said
she
simply
yes
to
remind
you
that
you
have
friends
you
have
been
here
in
secret
all
the
winter
calhoun
did
not
know
you
had
come
why
did
you
not
go
to
him
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
come
do
you
not
remember
our
bargain
each
day
i
expected
you
in
some
way
i
scarce
knew
how
the
weeks
wore
on
and
now
i
find
you
both
here
you
and
your
father
where
i
would
expect
to
find
neither
continually
you
violate
all
law
of
likelihood
but
now
you
have
seen
elisabeth
yes
i
have
seen
her
she
said
still
simply
i
could
think
of
no
word
suited
to
that
moment
i
stood
only
looking
at
her
she
would
have
spoken
but
on
the
instant
raised
a
hand
as
though
to
demand
my
silence
i
heard
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
peremptory
commanding
as
though
the
owner
came
you
must
go
into
another
room
said
helena
von
ritz
to
me
hurriedly
who
is
it
who
is
it
at
the
door
i
asked
she
looked
at
me
calmly
it
is
sir
richard
pakenham
said
she
this
is
his
usual
hour
i
will
send
him
away
go
now
quick
i
rapidly
passed
behind
the
screening
curtains
into
the
hall
even
as
i
heard
a
heavy
foot
stumbling
at
the
threshold
and
a
somewhat
husky
voice
offer
some
sort
of
salutation
chapter
xxxii
pakenham
price
the
happiest
women
like
nations
have
no
history
the
apartment
into
which
i
hurriedly
stepped
i
found
to
be
a
long
and
narrow
hall
heavily
draped
a
door
or
so
made
off
on
the
side
and
a
closed
door
also
appeared
at
the
farther
end
but
none
invited
me
to
enter
and
i
did
not
care
to
intrude
this
situation
did
not
please
me
because
i
must
perforce
hear
all
that
went
on
in
the
rooms
which
i
had
just
left
i
heard
the
thick
voice
of
a
man
apparently
none
the
better
for
wine
my
dear
it
began
i
some
gesture
must
have
warned
him
god
bless
my
soul
he
began
again
who
is
here
then
what
is
wrong
my
father
is
here
i
heard
her
clear
voice
answer
and
as
you
suggest
it
might
perhaps
be
better
god
bless
my
soul
he
repeated
but
my
dear
then
i
must
go
then
where
is
that
other
key
it
would
never
do
you
know
no
sir
richard
it
would
never
do
go
then
spoke
a
low
and
icy
voice
hers
yet
not
hers
hasten
i
heard
her
half
whisper
i
think
perhaps
my
father
but
it
was
my
own
footsteps
they
heard
this
was
something
to
which
i
could
not
be
party
yet
rapidly
as
i
walked
her
visitor
was
before
me
i
caught
sight
only
of
his
portly
back
as
the
street
door
closed
behind
him
she
stood
her
back
against
the
door
her
hand
spread
out
against
the
wall
as
though
to
keep
me
from
passing
i
paused
and
looked
at
her
held
by
the
horror
in
her
eyes
she
made
no
concealment
offered
no
apologies
and
showed
no
shame
i
repeat
that
it
was
only
horror
and
sadness
mingled
which
i
saw
upon
her
face
madam
i
began
and
again
madam
and
then
i
turned
away
you
see
she
said
sighing
yes
i
fear
i
see
but
i
wish
i
did
not
can
i
not
may
i
not
be
mistaken
no
it
is
true
there
is
no
mistake
what
have
you
done
why
did
you
not
always
credit
me
with
being
the
good
friend
of
pakenham
years
ago
did
not
all
the
city
well
then
i
was
but
i
now
i
was
england
agent
only
last
monsieur
you
have
come
too
soon
too
late
too
late
ah
my
god
my
god
last
night
i
gave
at
last
that
consent
he
comes
now
to
claim
to
exact
to
take
possession
of
me
ah
my
god
i
can
not
of
course
understand
you
madam
is
it
tell
me
for
three
years
england
minister
besought
me
to
be
his
not
england
property
it
was
not
true
what
the
town
thought
it
was
not
true
in
the
case
either
of
yturrio
intrigue
yes
i
loved
it
i
intrigued
with
england
and
mexico
both
because
it
was
in
my
nature
but
no
more
than
that
no
matter
what
i
once
was
in
europe
i
was
not
here
not
as
i
said
until
last
night
ah
monsieur
ah
monsieur
now
her
hands
were
beating
together
but
then
why
what
do
you
mean
i
demanded
because
no
other
way
sufficed
all
this
winter
here
alone
i
have
planned
and
thought
about
other
means
nothing
would
do
there
was
but
the
one
way
now
you
see
why
i
did
not
go
to
calhoun
why
i
kept
my
presence
here
secret
but
you
saw
elisabeth
yes
long
ago
my
friend
you
have
won
you
both
have
won
and
i
have
lost
she
loves
you
and
is
worthy
of
you
you
are
worthy
of
each
other
yes
i
saw
i
had
lost
and
i
told
you
i
would
pay
my
wager
i
told
you
i
would
give
you
her
and
oregon
well
then
that
last
was
hard
she
choked
that
was
hard
to
do
she
almost
sobbed
but
i
have
paid
heart
and
soul
and
i
have
now
he
comes
for
the
but
then
but
then
i
expostulated
what
does
this
mean
that
i
see
here
there
was
no
need
for
this
had
you
no
friends
among
us
why
though
it
meant
war
i
myself
would
choke
that
beast
pakenham
with
my
own
hands
no
you
will
not
but
did
i
not
hear
him
say
there
was
a
key
key
yes
england
once
owned
that
key
now
does
yes
it
is
true
since
yesterday
now
he
comes
but
madam
ah
how
could
you
so
disappoint
my
belief
in
you
because
she
smiled
bitterly
in
all
great
causes
there
are
sacrifices
but
no
cause
could
warrant
this
i
was
judge
of
that
was
her
response
i
saw
her
elisabeth
that
girl
then
i
saw
what
the
future
years
meant
for
me
i
tell
you
i
vowed
with
her
that
night
when
i
thought
you
two
were
wedded
i
did
more
i
vowed
myself
to
a
new
and
wider
world
that
night
now
i
have
lost
it
after
all
seeing
i
could
not
now
be
a
woman
and
be
happy
i
monsieur
i
pass
on
to
others
after
this
not
that
torture
of
life
but
that
torturing
of
which
we
so
often
spoke
yes
i
even
as
i
am
because
by
this
this
act
this
sacrifice
i
can
win
you
for
her
and
i
can
win
that
wider
america
which
you
have
coveted
which
i
covet
for
you
which
i
covet
you
i
could
do
no
more
than
remain
silent
and
allow
her
to
explain
what
was
not
in
the
least
apparent
to
me
after
a
time
she
went
on
now
now
i
say
pakenham
the
minister
is
sunk
in
pakenham
the
man
he
does
as
i
demand
because
he
is
a
man
he
signs
what
i
demand
because
i
am
a
woman
i
say
but
see
she
hastened
now
to
a
little
desk
and
caught
up
a
folded
document
which
lay
there
this
she
handed
to
me
unfolded
and
i
ran
it
over
with
a
hasty
glance
it
was
a
matter
of
tremendous
importance
which
lay
in
those
few
closely
written
lines
england
minister
offered
over
the
signature
of
england
a
compromise
of
the
whole
oregon
debate
provided
this
country
would
accept
the
line
of
the
degree
that
then
was
pakenham
price
for
this
key
that
lay
here
this
this
is
all
i
have
been
able
to
do
with
him
thus
far
she
faltered
it
is
not
enough
but
i
did
it
for
you
madam
this
is
more
than
all
america
has
been
able
to
do
before
this
has
not
been
made
public
no
no
it
is
not
enough
but
i
shall
make
him
surrender
all
all
north
to
the
very
ice
for
america
for
the
democracy
see
now
i
was
born
to
be
devoted
immolated
after
all
as
my
mother
was
before
me
that
is
fate
but
i
shall
make
fate
pay
ah
monsieur
ah
monsieur
she
flung
herself
to
her
feet
i
can
get
it
all
for
you
you
and
yours
she
reiterated
holding
out
her
hands
the
little
pink
fingers
upturned
as
was
often
her
gesture
you
shall
go
to
your
chief
and
tell
him
that
polk
was
right
that
you
yourself
who
taught
helena
von
ritz
what
life
is
taught
her
that
after
all
she
was
a
woman
are
able
because
she
was
a
woman
to
bring
in
your
own
hands
all
that
country
yes
to
forty
or
even
farther
i
do
not
know
what
all
can
be
done
i
only
know
that
a
fool
will
part
with
everything
for
the
sake
of
his
body
i
stood
now
looking
at
her
silent
trying
to
fathom
the
vastness
of
what
she
said
trying
to
understand
at
all
their
worth
the
motives
which
impelled
her
the
largeness
of
her
plan
yes
that
could
be
seen
the
largeness
of
her
heart
and
brain
yes
that
also
then
slowly
i
saw
yet
more
at
last
i
understood
what
i
saw
was
a
horror
to
my
soul
madam
said
i
to
her
at
last
did
you
indeed
think
me
so
cheap
as
that
come
here
i
led
her
to
the
central
apartment
and
motioned
her
to
a
seat
now
then
madam
much
has
been
done
here
as
you
say
it
is
all
that
ever
can
be
done
you
shall
not
see
pakenham
nor
ever
again
but
think
what
that
will
cost
you
she
broke
out
this
is
only
part
it
should
be
yours
i
flung
the
document
from
me
this
has
already
cost
too
much
i
said
we
do
not
buy
states
thus
but
it
will
cost
you
your
future
polk
is
your
enemy
now
as
he
is
calhoun
he
will
not
strike
you
now
but
so
soon
as
he
dares
he
will
now
if
you
could
do
this
if
you
could
take
this
to
calhoun
to
america
it
would
mean
for
you
personally
all
that
america
could
give
you
in
honors
honors
without
honor
madam
i
do
not
covet
i
replied
then
i
would
have
bit
my
tongue
through
when
i
saw
the
great
pallor
cross
her
face
at
the
cruelty
of
my
speech
and
she
said
spreading
out
her
hands
again
but
no
i
know
you
would
not
taunt
me
i
know
in
spite
of
what
you
say
there
must
be
a
sacrifice
well
then
i
have
made
it
i
have
made
my
atonement
i
say
i
can
give
you
now
even
thus
at
least
a
part
of
oregon
i
can
perhaps
give
you
of
oregon
the
pakenhams
have
always
dared
much
to
gain
their
ends
this
one
will
dare
even
treachery
to
his
country
if
i
do
not
kill
him
if
i
do
not
die
i
can
perhaps
give
you
all
of
oregon
bought
bought
and
paid
her
voice
trailed
off
into
a
whisper
which
seemed
loud
as
a
bugle
call
to
me
no
you
can
not
give
us
oregon
i
answered
we
are
men
not
panders
we
fight
we
do
not
traffic
thus
but
you
have
given
me
elisabeth
my
rival
she
smiled
at
me
in
spite
of
all
but
no
not
my
rival
yes
i
have
already
given
you
her
and
given
you
to
her
to
do
that
to
atone
as
i
said
for
my
attempt
to
part
you
well
i
will
give
pakenham
the
key
that
sir
richard
pakenham
of
england
lately
held
i
told
you
a
woman
pays
and
soul
in
what
coin
fate
gave
me
i
will
pay
it
you
think
my
morals
mixed
no
i
tell
you
i
am
clean
i
have
only
bought
my
own
peace
with
my
own
conscience
now
at
last
helena
von
ritz
knows
why
she
was
born
to
what
end
i
have
a
work
to
do
and
yes
i
see
it
now
my
journey
to
america
after
all
was
part
of
the
plan
of
fate
i
have
learned
much
through
you
monsieur
hurriedly
she
turned
and
left
me
passing
through
the
heavy
draperies
which
cut
off
the
room
where
stood
the
great
satin
couch
i
saw
her
cast
herself
there
her
arms
outflung
slow
deep
and
silent
sobs
shook
all
her
body
madam
madam
i
cried
to
her
do
not
do
not
what
you
have
done
here
is
worth
a
hundred
millions
of
dollars
a
hundred
thousand
of
lives
perhaps
yes
that
is
true
it
means
most
of
oregon
with
honor
and
without
war
that
is
true
and
it
is
much
but
the
price
paid
it
is
more
than
all
this
continent
is
worth
if
it
cost
so
much
as
that
nor
shall
it
black
with
a
million
of
red
the
world
swam
around
me
millions
of
dead
souls
or
souls
unborn
seemed
to
gaze
at
me
and
my
unhesitating
rage
i
caught
up
the
scroll
which
bore
signature
and
with
one
clutch
cast
it
in
two
pieces
on
the
floor
as
it
lay
we
gazed
at
it
in
silence
slowly
i
saw
a
great
soft
radiance
come
upon
her
face
the
red
cleared
away
from
my
own
vision
chapter
xxxiii
the
story
of
helena
von
ritz
there
is
in
every
true
woman
heart
a
spark
of
heavenly
fire
which
beams
and
blazes
in
the
dark
hours
of
but
madam
but
madam
i
tried
to
begin
at
last
after
moments
which
seemed
to
me
ages
long
i
broke
out
but
once
at
least
you
promised
to
tell
me
who
and
what
you
are
will
you
do
that
now
yes
yes
she
said
now
i
shall
finish
the
clearing
of
my
soul
you
after
all
shall
be
my
confessor
we
heard
again
a
faltering
footfall
in
the
hallway
i
raised
an
eyebrow
in
query
it
is
my
father
yes
but
let
him
come
he
also
must
hear
he
is
indeed
the
author
of
my
story
such
as
it
is
father
she
added
come
sit
you
here
i
have
something
to
say
to
mr
trist
she
seated
herself
now
on
one
of
the
low
couches
her
hands
clasped
across
its
arm
her
eyes
looking
far
away
out
of
the
little
window
beyond
which
could
be
seen
the
hills
across
the
wide
potomac
we
are
foreigners
she
went
on
as
you
can
tell
i
speak
your
language
better
than
my
father
does
because
i
was
younger
when
i
learned
it
is
quite
true
he
is
my
father
he
is
an
austrian
nobleman
of
one
of
the
old
families
he
was
educated
in
germany
and
of
late
has
lived
there
i
could
have
told
most
of
that
of
you
both
i
said
she
bowed
and
resumed
my
father
was
always
a
student
as
a
young
man
in
the
university
he
was
devoted
to
certain
theories
of
his
own
pas
vrai
mon
drôle
she
asked
turning
to
put
her
arm
on
her
father
shoulder
as
he
dropped
weakly
on
the
couch
beside
her
he
nodded
yes
i
wass
student
he
said
i
wass
not
content
with
the
ways
of
my
people
so
my
father
you
will
see
said
she
smiling
at
him
being
much
determined
on
anything
which
he
attempted
decided
with
five
others
to
make
a
certain
experiment
it
was
the
strangest
experiment
i
presume
ever
made
in
the
interest
of
what
is
called
science
it
was
wholly
the
most
curious
and
the
most
cruel
thing
ever
done
she
hesitated
now
all
i
could
do
was
to
look
from
one
to
the
other
wonderingly
this
dear
old
dreamer
my
father
then
and
five
others
i
name
them
he
interrupted
there
were
karl
von
goertz
albrecht
hardman
adolph
zu
sternbern
karl
von
starnack
and
rudolph
von
wardberg
we
were
all
friends
yes
she
said
softly
all
friends
and
all
fools
sometimes
i
think
of
my
mother
my
dear
your
mother
but
i
must
tell
this
as
it
was
then
sir
these
six
all
heidelberg
men
all
well
born
men
of
fortune
all
men
devoted
to
science
and
interested
in
the
study
of
the
hopelessness
of
the
average
human
being
in
central
europe
these
fools
or
heroes
i
say
not
which
they
decided
to
do
something
in
the
interest
of
science
they
were
of
the
belief
that
human
beings
were
becoming
poor
in
type
so
they
determined
to
marry
naturally
said
i
seeking
to
relieve
a
delicate
situation
they
scorned
the
marriage
of
convenience
they
came
to
our
american
way
of
thinking
that
they
would
marry
for
love
you
do
them
too
much
credit
said
she
slowly
that
would
have
meant
no
sacrifice
on
either
side
they
married
in
the
interest
of
they
married
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
improving
individuals
of
the
human
species
father
is
it
not
so
some
speech
stumbled
on
his
tongue
but
she
raised
her
hand
listen
to
me
i
will
be
fair
to
you
fairer
than
you
were
either
to
yourself
or
to
my
mother
yes
these
six
concluded
to
improve
the
grade
of
human
animals
they
resolved
to
marry
the
because
thus
they
could
select
finer
specimens
of
womankind
younger
stronger
more
fit
to
bring
children
into
the
world
is
not
that
the
truth
my
father
it
wass
the
way
we
thought
he
whispered
it
wass
the
way
we
thought
wass
wise
and
perhaps
it
was
wise
it
was
selection
so
now
they
selected
two
of
them
married
german
working
girls
and
those
two
are
dead
but
there
is
no
child
of
them
alive
two
married
in
austria
and
of
these
one
died
and
the
other
is
in
a
mad
house
one
married
a
young
galician
girl
and
so
fond
of
her
did
he
become
that
she
took
him
down
from
his
station
to
hers
and
he
was
lost
the
other
yes
it
was
my
father
she
said
at
length
there
he
sits
my
father
yes
i
love
him
i
would
forfeit
my
life
for
him
now
i
would
lay
it
down
gladly
for
him
better
had
i
done
so
but
in
my
time
i
have
hated
him
he
the
last
one
searched
long
for
this
fitting
animal
to
lead
to
the
altar
he
was
tall
and
young
and
handsome
and
rich
do
you
see
he
could
have
chosen
among
his
own
people
any
woman
he
liked
instead
he
searched
among
the
galicians
the
lower
austrians
the
prussians
he
examined
bavaria
and
saxony
many
he
found
but
still
none
to
suit
his
scientific
ideas
he
bethought
him
then
of
searching
among
the
hungarians
where
it
is
said
the
most
beautiful
women
of
the
world
are
found
so
at
last
he
found
her
that
peasant
mother
the
silence
in
the
room
was
broken
at
last
by
her
low
even
hopeless
voice
as
she
went
on
now
the
hungarians
are
slaves
to
austria
they
do
as
they
are
bid
those
who
live
on
the
great
estates
they
have
no
hope
if
they
rebel
they
are
cut
down
they
are
not
a
people
they
belong
to
no
one
not
even
to
themselves
my
god
said
i
a
sigh
breaking
from
me
in
spite
of
myself
i
raised
my
hand
as
though
to
beseech
her
not
to
go
on
but
she
persisted
yes
we
too
called
upon
gods
so
now
my
father
came
among
that
people
and
found
there
a
young
girl
one
much
younger
than
himself
she
was
the
most
beautiful
so
they
say
of
all
those
people
many
of
whom
are
very
beautiful
yes
proof
of
that
said
i
she
knew
i
meant
no
idle
flattery
yes
she
was
beautiful
but
at
first
she
did
not
fancy
to
marry
this
austrian
student
nobleman
she
said
no
to
him
even
when
she
found
who
he
was
and
what
was
his
station
even
when
she
found
that
he
meant
her
no
dishonor
but
our
ruler
heard
of
it
and
being
displeased
at
this
mockery
of
the
traditions
of
the
court
and
wishing
in
his
sardonic
mind
to
teach
these
fanatical
young
nobles
to
rue
well
their
bargain
he
sent
word
to
the
girl
that
she
marry
this
man
my
father
it
was
made
an
imperial
order
and
so
now
at
last
since
he
was
half
crazed
by
her
beauty
as
men
are
sometimes
by
the
beauty
of
women
and
since
at
last
this
had
its
effect
with
her
as
sometimes
it
does
with
women
and
since
it
was
perhaps
death
or
some
severe
punishment
if
she
did
not
obey
she
married
him
my
father
and
loved
me
all
her
life
the
old
man
broke
out
nefer
had
man
love
like
hers
i
will
haf
it
said
i
will
haf
it
said
that
she
loved
me
always
and
always
and
i
loved
always
with
all
my
heart
yes
said
helena
von
ritz
they
two
loved
each
other
even
as
they
were
so
here
am
i
born
of
that
love
now
we
all
sat
silent
for
a
time
that
birth
was
at
my
estates
resumed
the
same
even
merciless
voice
after
some
short
time
of
travels
they
returned
to
the
estates
and
yes
there
i
was
born
half
noble
half
peasant
and
then
there
began
the
most
cruel
thing
the
world
has
ever
known
the
nobles
of
the
court
and
of
the
country
all
around
began
to
make
existence
hideous
for
my
mother
the
aristocracy
insulted
by
the
republicanism
of
these
young
noblemen
made
life
a
hell
for
the
most
gentle
woman
of
hungary
ah
they
found
new
ways
to
make
her
suffer
they
allowed
her
to
share
in
my
father
estate
allowed
her
to
appear
with
him
when
he
could
prevail
upon
her
to
do
so
then
they
twitted
and
taunted
her
and
mocked
her
in
all
the
devilish
ways
of
their
class
she
was
more
beautiful
than
any
court
beauty
of
them
all
and
they
hated
her
for
that
she
had
a
good
mind
and
they
hated
her
for
that
she
had
a
faithful
loyal
heart
and
they
hated
her
for
that
and
in
ways
more
cruel
than
any
man
will
ever
know
women
and
men
made
her
feel
that
hate
plainly
and
publicly
made
her
admit
that
she
was
chosen
as
breeding
stock
and
nothing
better
ah
it
was
the
jest
of
europe
for
a
time
they
insulted
my
mother
and
that
became
the
jest
of
the
court
of
all
vienna
she
dared
not
go
alone
from
the
castle
she
dared
not
travel
alone
but
your
father
resented
this
she
nodded
duel
after
duel
he
fought
man
after
man
he
killed
thanks
to
his
love
for
her
and
his
manhood
he
would
not
release
what
he
loved
he
would
not
allow
his
class
to
separate
him
from
his
choice
but
the
ah
he
could
not
fight
them
so
i
have
hated
women
and
made
war
on
them
all
my
life
my
father
could
not
placate
his
emperor
so
in
short
that
scientific
experiment
ended
in
misery
and
me
the
room
had
grown
dimmer
the
sun
was
sinking
as
she
talked
there
was
silence
i
know
for
a
long
time
before
she
spoke
again
in
time
then
my
father
left
his
estates
and
went
out
to
a
small
place
in
the
country
but
my
mother
her
heart
was
broken
malice
pursued
her
those
who
were
called
her
superiors
would
not
let
her
alone
see
he
weeps
my
father
as
he
thinks
of
these
things
there
was
cause
then
to
weep
for
two
years
they
tell
me
my
mother
wept
then
she
died
she
gave
me
a
baby
to
her
friend
a
woman
of
her
village
threlka
mazoff
you
have
seen
her
she
has
been
my
mother
ever
since
she
has
been
the
sole
guardian
i
have
known
all
my
life
she
has
not
been
able
to
do
with
me
as
she
would
have
liked
you
did
not
live
at
your
own
home
with
your
father
i
asked
for
a
time
i
grew
up
but
my
father
i
think
was
permanently
shocked
by
the
loss
of
the
woman
he
had
loved
and
whom
he
had
brought
into
all
this
cruelty
she
had
been
so
lovable
so
beautiful
she
was
so
beautiful
my
mother
so
they
sent
me
away
to
france
to
the
schools
i
grew
up
i
presume
proof
in
part
of
the
excellence
of
my
theory
they
told
me
that
i
was
a
beautiful
animal
the
contempt
the
scorn
the
pathos
the
whole
tragedy
of
her
voice
and
bearing
were
such
as
i
can
not
set
down
on
paper
and
such
as
i
scarce
could
endure
to
hear
never
in
my
life
before
have
i
felt
such
pity
for
a
human
being
never
so
much
desire
to
do
what
i
might
in
sheer
compassion
but
now
how
clear
it
all
became
to
me
i
could
understand
many
strange
things
about
the
character
of
this
singular
woman
her
whims
her
unaccountable
moods
her
seeming
carelessness
yet
withal
her
dignity
and
sweetness
and
air
of
breeding
above
all
her
mysteriousness
let
others
judge
her
for
themselves
there
was
only
longing
in
my
heart
that
i
might
find
some
word
of
comfort
what
could
comfort
her
was
not
life
indeed
for
her
to
remain
a
perpetual
tragedy
but
madam
said
i
at
length
you
must
not
wrong
your
father
and
your
mother
and
yourself
these
two
loved
each
other
devotedly
well
what
more
you
are
the
result
of
a
happy
marriage
you
are
beautiful
you
are
splendid
by
that
reason
perhaps
even
when
i
was
sixteen
i
was
beautiful
she
mused
i
have
heard
rumors
of
that
but
i
say
to
you
that
then
i
was
only
a
beautiful
animal
also
i
was
a
vicious
animal
i
had
in
my
heart
all
the
malice
which
my
mother
never
spoke
i
felt
in
my
soul
the
wish
to
injure
women
to
punish
men
to
torment
them
to
make
them
pay
to
set
even
those
balances
of
torture
ah
that
was
my
ambition
i
had
not
forgotten
that
when
i
first
met
you
when
i
first
heard
of
her
the
woman
whom
you
love
whom
already
in
your
savage
strong
way
you
have
wedded
the
woman
whose
vows
i
spoke
with
her
i
i
helena
von
ritz
with
history
such
as
mine
father
father
she
turned
to
him
swiftly
rise
go
i
can
not
now
speak
before
you
leave
us
alone
until
i
call
obedient
as
though
he
had
been
the
child
and
she
the
parent
the
old
man
rose
and
tottered
feebly
from
the
room
there
are
things
a
woman
can
not
say
in
the
presence
of
a
parent
she
said
turning
to
me
her
face
twitched
it
takes
all
my
bravery
to
talk
to
you
why
should
you
there
is
not
need
do
not
ah
i
must
because
it
is
fair
said
she
i
have
lost
lost
i
told
you
i
would
pay
my
wager
after
a
time
she
turned
her
face
straight
toward
mine
and
went
on
with
her
old
splendid
bravery
so
now
you
see
when
i
was
young
and
beautiful
i
had
rank
and
money
i
had
brains
i
had
hatred
of
men
i
had
contempt
for
the
aristocracy
my
heart
was
peasant
after
all
my
principles
were
those
of
the
republican
revolution
was
in
my
soul
i
say
thwarted
distorted
wretched
unscrupulous
i
did
what
i
could
to
make
hell
for
those
who
had
made
hell
for
us
i
have
set
dozens
of
men
by
the
ears
i
have
been
promised
in
marriage
to
i
know
not
how
many
a
dozen
men
have
fought
to
the
death
in
duels
over
me
for
each
such
death
i
had
not
even
a
thought
the
more
troubles
i
made
the
happier
i
was
oh
yes
in
time
i
became
known
i
had
a
reputation
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
but
still
the
organized
aristocracy
had
its
revenge
it
had
its
will
of
me
after
all
there
came
to
me
as
there
had
to
my
mother
an
imperial
order
in
punishment
for
my
fancies
and
vagaries
i
was
condemned
to
marry
a
certain
nobleman
that
was
the
whim
of
the
new
emperor
ferdinand
the
degenerate
he
took
the
throne
when
i
was
but
sixteen
years
of
age
he
chose
for
me
a
degenerate
mate
from
his
own
sort
she
choked
now
you
did
marry
him
she
nodded
yes
debauché
rake
monster
degenerate
product
of
that
aristocracy
which
had
oppressed
us
i
was
obliged
to
marry
him
a
man
three
times
my
age
i
pleaded
i
begged
i
was
taken
away
by
night
i
was
i
was
they
say
i
was
married
to
him
for
myself
i
did
not
know
where
i
was
or
what
happened
but
after
that
they
said
that
i
was
the
wife
of
this
man
a
sot
a
monster
the
memory
only
of
manhood
now
indeed
the
revenge
of
the
aristocracy
was
complete
she
went
on
at
last
in
a
voice
icy
cold
i
fled
one
night
back
to
hungary
for
a
month
they
could
not
find
me
i
was
still
young
i
saw
my
people
then
as
i
had
not
before
i
saw
also
the
monarchies
of
europe
ah
now
i
knew
what
oppression
meant
now
i
knew
what
class
distinction
and
special
privileges
meant
i
saw
what
ruin
it
was
spelling
for
our
country
what
it
will
spell
for
your
country
if
they
ever
come
to
rule
here
ah
then
that
dream
came
to
me
which
had
come
to
my
father
that
beautiful
dream
which
justified
me
in
everything
i
did
my
friend
can
it
can
it
in
part
justify
me
now
for
the
first
time
then
i
resolved
to
live
i
have
loved
my
father
ever
since
that
time
i
pledged
myself
to
continue
that
work
which
he
had
undertaken
i
pledged
myself
to
better
the
condition
of
humanity
if
i
might
there
was
no
hope
for
me
i
was
condemned
and
ruined
as
it
was
my
life
was
gone
such
as
i
had
left
that
i
resolved
to
give
to
what
shall
we
call
it
now
may
god
rest
my
mother
soul
and
mine
also
so
that
some
time
i
may
see
her
in
another
world
i
pray
i
may
be
good
enough
for
that
some
time
i
have
not
been
sweet
and
sinless
as
was
my
mother
fate
laid
a
heavier
burden
upon
me
but
what
remained
with
me
throughout
was
the
idea
which
my
father
had
bequeathed
me
ah
but
also
that
beauty
and
sweetness
and
loyalty
which
came
to
you
from
your
mother
i
insisted
she
shook
her
head
wait
she
said
now
they
pursued
me
as
though
i
had
been
a
criminal
and
they
took
me
back
horsemen
about
me
who
did
as
they
liked
i
was
i
say
a
sacrifice
news
of
this
came
to
that
man
who
was
my
husband
they
shamed
him
into
fighting
he
had
not
the
courage
of
the
nobles
left
but
he
heard
of
one
nobleman
against
whom
he
had
a
special
grudge
and
him
one
night
foully
and
unfairly
he
murdered
news
of
that
came
to
the
emperor
my
husband
was
tried
and
the
case
being
well
known
to
the
public
it
was
necessary
to
convict
him
for
the
sake
of
example
then
on
the
day
set
for
his
beheading
the
emperor
reprieved
him
the
hour
for
the
execution
passed
and
being
now
free
for
the
time
he
fled
the
country
he
went
to
africa
and
there
he
so
disgraced
the
state
that
bore
him
that
of
late
times
i
hear
he
has
been
sent
for
to
come
back
to
austria
even
yet
the
emperor
may
suspend
the
reprieve
and
send
him
to
the
block
for
his
ancient
crime
if
he
had
a
thousand
heads
he
could
not
atone
for
the
worse
crimes
he
has
done
but
of
him
and
of
his
end
i
know
nothing
so
now
you
see
i
was
and
am
wed
and
yet
am
not
wed
and
never
was
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
nor
who
i
am
after
all
i
can
not
tell
you
who
i
am
or
what
i
am
because
i
myself
do
not
know
it
was
now
no
longer
safe
for
me
in
my
own
country
they
would
not
let
me
go
to
my
father
any
more
as
for
him
he
went
on
with
his
studies
some
part
of
his
mind
being
bright
and
clear
they
did
not
wish
him
about
the
court
now
all
these
matters
were
to
be
hushed
up
the
court
of
england
began
to
take
cognizance
of
these
things
our
government
was
scandalized
they
sent
my
father
on
pretext
of
scientific
errands
into
one
country
and
another
to
sweden
to
england
to
africa
at
last
to
america
thus
it
happened
that
you
met
him
you
must
both
have
been
very
near
to
meeting
me
in
montreal
it
was
fate
as
we
of
hungary
would
say
as
for
me
i
was
no
mere
radical
i
did
not
go
to
russia
did
not
join
the
revolutionary
circles
of
paris
did
not
yet
seek
out
prussia
that
is
folly
my
father
was
right
it
must
be
the
years
it
must
be
the
good
heritage
it
must
be
the
good
environment
it
must
be
even
opportunity
for
all
which
alone
can
produce
good
human
beings
in
short
believe
me
a
victim
hope
of
the
world
is
in
a
real
slowly
gradually
i
was
coming
to
believe
that
she
paused
a
moment
then
one
time
monsieur
i
met
you
here
in
this
very
room
god
pity
me
you
were
the
first
man
i
had
ever
seen
god
pity
me
i
believe
i
loved
you
that
night
that
very
first
night
we
are
friends
we
are
brave
you
are
man
and
gentleman
so
i
may
say
that
now
i
am
no
longer
woman
i
am
but
sacrifice
opportunity
must
exist
open
and
free
for
all
the
world
she
went
on
not
looking
at
me
more
than
i
could
now
at
her
i
have
set
my
life
to
prove
this
thing
when
i
came
here
to
this
america
out
of
pique
out
of
a
love
of
adventure
out
of
sheer
daring
and
exultation
in
imposture
i
saw
why
i
was
born
for
what
purpose
it
was
to
do
such
work
as
i
might
to
prove
the
theory
of
my
father
and
to
justify
the
life
of
my
mother
for
that
thing
i
was
born
for
that
thing
i
have
been
damned
on
this
earth
i
may
be
damned
in
the
life
to
come
unless
i
can
make
some
great
atonement
for
these
i
suffer
and
shall
always
suffer
but
what
of
that
there
must
always
be
a
sacrifice
the
unspeakable
tragedy
of
her
voice
cut
to
my
soul
but
listen
i
broke
out
you
are
young
you
are
free
all
the
world
is
before
you
you
can
have
anything
you
like
ah
do
not
talk
to
me
of
that
she
exclaimed
imperiously
do
not
tempt
me
to
attempt
the
deceit
of
myself
i
made
myself
as
i
am
long
ago
i
did
not
love
i
did
not
know
it
as
to
marriage
i
did
not
need
it
i
had
abundant
means
without
i
was
in
the
upper
ranks
of
society
i
was
there
i
was
classified
i
lived
with
them
but
always
i
had
my
purposes
my
plans
for
them
i
paid
paid
paid
as
a
woman
must
with
what
a
woman
has
but
now
i
am
far
ahead
of
my
story
let
me
bring
it
on
i
went
to
paris
i
have
sown
some
seeds
of
venom
some
seeds
of
revolution
in
one
place
or
another
in
europe
in
my
time
ah
it
works
it
will
go
here
and
there
i
have
cost
a
human
life
here
and
there
work
was
to
be
done
which
i
disliked
but
i
did
it
misguided
uncared
for
mishandled
as
i
had
been
well
as
i
said
i
went
to
paris
ah
sir
will
you
not
too
leave
the
room
and
let
me
tell
on
this
story
to
myself
to
my
own
soul
it
is
fitter
for
my
confessor
than
for
you
let
me
then
your
confessor
said
i
forget
forget
you
have
not
been
this
which
you
say
do
i
not
know
no
you
do
not
know
well
let
be
let
me
go
on
i
say
i
went
to
paris
i
was
close
to
the
throne
of
france
that
little
duke
of
orleans
son
of
louis
philippe
was
a
puppet
in
my
hands
oh
i
do
not
doubt
i
did
mischief
in
that
court
or
at
least
if
i
failed
it
was
through
no
lack
of
effort
i
was
called
there
vespucci
they
thought
me
italian
at
last
they
came
to
know
who
i
was
they
dared
not
make
open
rupture
in
the
face
of
the
courts
of
europe
certain
of
their
high
officials
came
to
me
and
my
young
duke
of
orleans
they
asked
me
to
leave
paris
they
did
not
command
it
the
duke
of
orleans
cared
for
that
part
of
it
but
they
requested
me
outside
not
in
his
presence
they
offered
me
a
price
a
bribe
such
an
offering
as
would
i
fancied
leave
me
free
to
pursue
my
own
ideas
in
my
own
fashion
and
in
any
corner
of
the
world
you
have
perhaps
seen
some
of
my
little
fancies
i
imagined
that
love
and
happiness
were
never
for
me
only
ambition
and
unrest
with
these
goes
luxury
sometimes
at
least
this
sort
of
personal
liberty
was
offered
me
the
price
of
leaving
paris
and
leaving
the
son
of
louis
philippe
to
his
own
devices
i
did
so
and
so
then
you
came
to
washington
that
must
have
been
some
years
ago
yes
some
five
years
ago
i
still
was
young
i
told
you
that
you
must
have
known
me
and
so
no
doubt
you
did
did
ever
hear
of
vespucci
a
smile
came
to
my
face
at
the
suggestion
of
that
celebrated
adventuress
and
mysterious
impostress
who
had
figured
in
the
annals
of
washington
a
fair
italian
so
the
rumor
ran
who
had
come
to
this
country
to
set
up
a
claim
upon
our
credulity
at
least
as
to
being
the
descendant
of
none
less
than
amerigo
vespucci
himself
this
supposititious
italian
had
indeed
gone
so
far
as
to
secure
the
introduction
of
a
bill
in
congress
granting
to
her
certain
lands
the
fate
of
that
bill
even
then
hung
in
the
balance
i
had
no
reason
to
put
anything
beyond
the
audacity
of
this
woman
with
whom
i
spoke
my
smile
was
simply
that
which
marked
the
eventual
voting
down
of
this
once
celebrated
measure
as
merry
and
as
bold
a
jest
as
ever
was
offered
the
credulity
of
a
nation
one
conceivable
only
in
the
mad
and
bitter
wit
of
helena
von
ritz
yes
madam
i
said
i
have
heard
of
vespucci
i
presume
that
you
are
now
about
to
repeat
that
you
are
she
she
nodded
the
mischievous
enjoyment
of
her
colossal
jest
showing
in
her
eyes
in
spite
of
all
yes
said
she
among
other
things
i
have
been
vespucci
there
seemed
little
to
do
here
in
intrigue
and
that
was
my
first
endeavor
to
amuse
myself
then
i
found
other
employment
england
needed
a
skilful
secret
agent
why
should
i
be
faithful
to
england
at
least
why
should
i
not
also
enjoy
intrigue
with
yonder
government
of
mexico
at
the
same
time
there
came
also
van
zandt
of
this
republic
of
texas
yes
it
is
true
i
have
seen
some
sport
here
in
washington
but
all
the
time
as
i
played
in
my
own
little
game
with
no
one
to
enjoy
it
save
myself
i
saw
myself
begin
to
lose
this
country
this
great
splendid
country
of
savages
began
to
take
me
by
the
hands
began
to
look
me
in
the
eyes
and
to
ask
me
von
ritz
what
are
you
what
might
you
have
been
so
now
she
concluded
you
asked
me
asked
me
what
i
was
and
i
have
told
you
i
ask
you
myself
what
am
i
what
am
i
to
be
and
i
say
i
am
unclean
but
being
as
i
am
i
have
done
what
i
have
done
it
was
for
a
principle
or
it
was
for
you
i
do
not
know
there
are
those
who
can
be
nothing
else
but
clean
i
broke
out
i
shall
not
endure
to
hear
you
speak
thus
of
yourself
you
you
what
have
you
not
done
for
us
was
not
your
mother
clean
in
her
heart
sins
such
as
you
mention
were
never
those
of
scarlet
if
you
have
sinned
your
sins
are
white
as
snow
i
at
least
am
confessor
enough
to
tell
you
that
ah
my
confessor
she
reached
out
her
hands
to
me
her
eyes
swimming
wet
then
she
pushed
me
back
suddenly
beating
with
her
little
hands
upon
my
breast
as
though
i
were
an
enemy
do
not
she
said
go
my
eye
caught
sight
of
the
great
key
lying
there
on
the
table
maddened
i
caught
it
up
and
with
a
quick
wrench
of
my
naked
hands
broke
it
in
two
and
threw
the
halves
on
the
floor
to
join
the
torn
scroll
of
england
pledge
i
divided
oregon
at
the
parallel
and
not
at
forty
when
i
broke
pakenham
key
but
you
shall
see
why
i
have
never
regretted
that
ask
sir
richard
pakenham
if
he
wants
his
key
i
said
chapter
xxxiv
the
victory
she
will
not
stay
the
siege
of
loving
terms
nor
bide
the
encounter
of
assailing
eyes
nor
ope
her
lap
to
gold
for
she
is
wise
if
i
can
judge
of
her
and
fair
she
is
if
that
mine
eyes
be
true
and
true
she
is
as
she
hath
proved
herself
what
have
you
done
she
exclaimed
are
you
mad
he
may
be
here
at
any
moment
now
go
at
once
i
shall
not
go
my
house
is
my
own
i
am
my
own
you
know
it
is
not
true
madam
i
saw
the
slow
shudder
that
crossed
her
form
the
the
fringe
of
wet
which
sprang
to
her
eyelashes
again
the
pleading
gesture
of
her
fingers
ah
what
matter
she
said
it
is
only
one
woman
more
against
so
much
what
is
past
is
past
monsieur
once
down
a
woman
does
not
rise
you
forget
history
you
forget
the
thief
upon
the
cross
the
thief
on
the
cross
was
not
a
woman
no
i
am
guilty
beyond
hope
rather
you
are
only
mad
beyond
reason
madam
i
shall
not
go
so
long
as
you
feel
thus
although
god
knows
i
am
no
confessor
i
confessed
to
you
told
you
my
story
so
there
could
be
no
bridge
across
the
gulf
between
us
my
happiness
ended
then
it
is
of
no
consequence
that
we
be
happy
madam
i
give
you
back
your
own
words
about
yon
torch
of
principles
for
a
time
she
sat
and
looked
at
me
steadily
there
was
i
say
some
sort
of
radiance
on
her
face
though
i
dull
of
wit
could
neither
understand
nor
describe
it
i
only
knew
that
she
seemed
to
ponder
for
a
long
time
seemed
to
resolve
at
last
slowly
she
rose
and
left
me
parting
the
satin
draperies
which
screened
her
boudoir
from
the
outer
room
there
was
silence
for
some
time
perhaps
she
prayed
i
do
not
know
now
other
events
took
this
situation
in
hand
i
heard
a
footfall
on
the
walk
a
cautious
knocking
on
the
great
front
door
so
my
lord
pakenham
was
prompt
now
i
could
not
escape
even
if
i
liked
pale
and
calm
she
reappeared
at
the
parted
draperies
i
lifted
the
butts
of
my
two
derringers
into
view
at
my
side
pockets
and
at
a
glance
from
her
hurriedly
stepped
into
the
opposite
room
after
a
time
i
heard
her
open
the
door
in
response
to
a
second
knock
i
could
not
see
her
from
my
station
but
the
very
silence
gave
me
a
picture
of
her
standing
pale
forbidding
rebuking
the
first
rude
exclamation
of
his
ardor
come
now
is
he
gone
is
the
place
safe
at
last
he
demanded
enter
my
lord
she
said
simply
this
is
the
hour
you
said
he
began
and
she
answered
my
lord
it
is
the
hour
but
come
what
the
matter
then
you
act
solemn
as
though
this
were
a
funeral
and
not
just
a
kiss
i
heard
him
add
he
must
have
advanced
toward
her
continually
i
was
upon
the
point
of
stepping
out
from
my
concealment
but
as
continually
she
left
that
not
quite
possible
by
some
word
or
look
or
gesture
of
her
own
with
him
oh
hang
it
i
heard
him
grumble
at
length
how
can
one
tell
what
a
woman
do
damn
it
helen
you
mean
well
then
madam
why
all
this
have
i
stood
flouts
and
indignities
enough
from
you
did
you
make
a
show
of
me
before
that
ass
tyler
when
i
was
at
the
very
point
of
my
greatest
coup
you
denied
knowledge
that
i
knew
you
had
but
did
i
discard
you
for
that
i
have
found
you
since
then
playing
with
mexico
texas
united
states
all
at
once
have
i
punished
you
for
no
i
have
only
shown
you
the
more
regard
my
lord
you
punish
me
most
when
you
most
show
me
your
regard
well
god
bless
my
soul
listen
at
that
listen
at
that
here
now
when
i
madam
you
shock
me
you
grieve
me
i
could
i
have
a
glass
of
wine
i
heard
her
ring
for
threlka
heard
her
fasten
the
door
behind
her
as
she
left
heard
him
gulp
over
his
glass
for
myself
although
i
did
not
yet
disclose
myself
i
felt
no
doubt
that
i
should
kill
pakenham
in
these
rooms
i
even
pondered
whether
i
should
shoot
him
through
the
temple
and
cut
off
his
consciousness
or
through
the
chest
and
so
let
him
know
why
he
died
after
a
time
he
seemed
to
look
about
the
room
his
eye
falling
upon
the
littered
floor
my
key
he
exclaimed
broken
who
did
that
i
ca
use
it
now
you
will
not
need
to
use
it
my
lord
but
i
bought
it
yesterday
had
i
given
you
all
of
the
oregon
country
it
would
not
have
been
worth
twenty
thousand
pounds
what
i
have
what
i
take
will
be
worth
twice
that
but
i
bought
that
key
and
what
i
buy
i
keep
i
heard
a
struggle
but
she
repulsed
him
once
more
in
some
way
still
my
time
had
not
come
he
seemed
now
to
stoop
grunting
to
pick
up
something
from
the
floor
how
now
my
memorandum
of
treaty
and
torn
in
two
oh
i
see
i
see
he
mused
you
wish
to
give
it
back
to
me
to
be
wholly
free
it
means
only
that
you
wish
to
love
me
for
myself
for
what
i
am
you
minx
you
mistake
my
lord
said
her
calm
cold
voice
at
least
was
no
mistake
that
i
offered
you
this
damned
country
at
risk
of
my
own
head
are
you
then
with
england
and
sir
richard
pakenham
will
you
give
my
family
a
chance
for
revenge
on
these
accursed
heathen
these
americans
come
do
that
and
i
leave
this
place
with
you
and
quit
diplomacy
for
good
we
travel
the
continent
we
go
the
world
over
you
and
i
quit
my
estates
my
family
for
you
come
now
why
do
you
delay
still
you
misunderstand
my
lord
tell
me
then
what
you
do
mean
our
old
bargain
over
this
is
broken
my
lord
we
must
make
another
his
anger
rose
what
you
want
more
you
trying
to
lead
me
on
with
your
damned
courtezan
tricks
i
heard
her
voice
rise
high
and
shrill
even
as
i
started
forward
monsieur
she
cried
back
with
you
pakenham
angered
as
he
was
seemed
half
to
hear
my
footsteps
seemed
half
to
know
the
swinging
of
the
draperies
even
as
i
stepped
back
in
obedience
to
her
gesture
her
wit
was
quick
as
ever
my
lord
she
said
pray
close
yonder
window
the
draft
is
bad
and
moreover
we
should
have
secrecy
he
obeyed
her
and
she
led
him
still
further
from
the
thought
of
investigating
his
surroundings
now
my
lord
she
said
what
you
have
just
said
under
penalty
he
sneered
of
your
life
yes
so
he
grunted
admiringly
well
now
i
like
fire
in
a
woman
even
a
deceiving
like
you
monsieur
her
voice
cried
again
and
once
more
it
restrained
me
in
my
hiding
you
devil
he
resumed
sneering
now
in
all
his
ugliness
of
wine
and
rage
and
disappointment
what
were
mistress
of
the
prince
of
france
toy
of
a
score
of
nobles
slave
of
that
infamous
rake
your
husband
much
you
got
in
your
life
to
make
you
uppish
now
with
me
my
lord
she
said
evenly
retract
that
if
you
do
not
you
shall
not
leave
this
place
alive
in
some
way
she
mastered
him
even
in
his
ugly
mood
well
well
he
growled
i
admit
we
do
get
on
very
well
in
our
little
love
affair
but
i
swear
you
drive
me
out
of
my
mind
i
never
find
another
woman
in
the
world
like
you
it
sir
richard
pakenham
asks
you
to
begin
a
new
future
with
himself
we
begin
no
future
my
lord
what
do
you
mean
have
you
lied
to
me
do
you
mean
to
break
your
word
your
promise
it
is
within
the
hour
that
i
have
learned
what
the
truth
is
god
damn
my
soul
i
heard
him
curse
growling
yes
my
lord
she
answered
god
will
damn
your
soul
in
so
far
as
it
is
that
of
a
brute
and
not
that
of
a
gentleman
or
a
statesman
i
heard
him
drop
into
a
chair
this
from
one
of
your
sort
he
half
whimpered
stop
now
she
cried
not
one
word
more
of
that
i
say
within
the
hour
i
have
learned
what
is
the
truth
i
am
helena
von
ritz
thief
on
the
cross
and
at
last
clean
god
madam
how
pious
he
sneered
something
behind
all
this
i
know
your
record
what
woman
of
the
court
of
austria
or
france
comes
out
with
we
used
you
here
because
you
had
none
and
now
when
it
comes
to
the
settlement
between
you
and
me
you
talk
like
a
nun
as
though
a
trifle
from
virtue
such
as
yours
would
be
missed
ah
my
god
i
heard
her
murmur
then
again
she
called
to
me
as
he
thought
to
himself
so
that
all
was
as
it
had
been
for
the
time
a
silence
fell
before
she
went
on
sir
richard
she
said
at
length
we
do
not
meet
again
i
await
now
your
full
apology
for
these
things
you
have
said
such
secrets
as
i
have
learned
of
england
you
know
will
remain
safe
with
me
also
your
own
secret
will
be
safe
retract
then
what
you
have
said
of
my
personal
life
oh
well
then
he
grumbled
i
admit
i
had
a
bit
of
wine
i
do
mean
much
of
anything
by
it
but
here
now
i
have
come
and
by
your
own
invitation
your
own
agreement
being
here
i
find
this
treaty
regarding
oregon
torn
in
two
and
you
gone
nun
all
yes
my
lord
it
is
torn
in
two
the
consideration
moving
to
it
was
not
valid
but
now
i
wish
you
to
amend
that
treaty
once
more
and
for
a
consideration
valid
in
every
way
my
lord
i
promised
that
which
was
not
mine
to
give
myself
did
you
lay
hand
on
me
now
i
should
die
if
you
kissed
me
i
should
kill
you
and
myself
as
you
say
i
took
yonder
price
the
devil
shilling
did
i
go
on
i
would
be
enlisting
for
the
damnation
of
my
soul
but
i
will
not
go
on
i
recant
but
good
god
woman
what
are
you
asking
do
you
want
me
to
let
you
have
this
paper
anyhow
to
show
old
john
calhoun
i
no
such
ass
as
that
i
apologize
for
what
i
said
about
you

be
your
friend
because
i
ca
let
you
go
but
as
to
this
paper
here
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
my
lord
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
before
you
leave
this
room
there
shall
be
two
miracles
done
you
shall
admit
that
one
has
gone
on
in
me
i
shall
see
that
you
yourself
have
done
another
what
guessing
game
do
you
propose
madam
he
sneered
he
seemed
to
toss
the
torn
paper
on
the
table
none
the
less
the
condition
is
forfeited
he
began
no
it
is
not
forfeited
except
by
your
own
word
my
lord
rejoined
the
same
even
icy
voice
you
shall
see
now
the
first
miracle
under
duress
he
sneered
again
then
under
duress
of
what
has
not
often
come
to
surface
in
you
sir
richard
i
ask
you
to
do
truth
and
not
treason
my
lord
she
who
was
helena
von
ritz
is
dead
has
passed
away
there
can
be
no
question
of
forfeit
between
you
and
her
look
my
lord
i
heard
a
half
sob
from
him
i
heard
a
faint
rustling
of
silks
and
laces
still
her
even
icy
voice
went
on
rise
now
sir
richard
she
said
unfasten
my
girdle
if
you
like
undo
my
clasps
if
you
can
you
say
you
know
my
past
tell
me
do
you
see
me
now
ungird
me
sir
richard
look
at
me
covet
me
take
me
apparently
he
half
rose
shuffled
towards
her
and
stopped
with
a
stifled
sound
half
a
sob
half
a
growl
i
dared
not
picture
to
myself
what
he
must
have
seen
as
she
stood
fronting
him
her
hands
as
i
imagined
at
her
bosom
tearing
back
her
robes
again
i
heard
her
voice
go
on
challenging
him
strip
me
now
sir
richard
if
you
can
take
now
what
you
bought
if
you
find
it
here
you
can
not
you
do
not
ah
then
tell
me
that
miracle
has
been
done
she
who
was
helena
von
ritz
as
you
knew
her
or
as
you
thought
you
knew
her
not
here
now
fell
long
silence
i
could
hear
the
breathing
of
them
both
where
i
stood
in
the
farther
corner
of
my
room
i
had
dropped
both
the
derringers
back
in
my
pockets
now
because
i
knew
there
would
be
no
need
for
them
her
voice
was
softer
as
she
went
on
tell
me
sir
richard
has
not
that
miracle
been
done
she
demanded
might
not
in
great
stress
that
thief
upon
the
cross
have
been
a
woman
tell
me
sir
richard
am
i
not
clean
he
flung
his
body
into
a
seat
his
arm
across
the
table
i
heard
his
groan
god
woman
what
are
you
he
exclaimed
clean
by
god
yes
as
a
lily
i
wish
i
were
half
as
white
myself
sir
richard
did
you
ever
love
a
woman
one
other
beside
yourself
long
ago
may
not
we
two
ask
that
other
miracle
of
yourself
how
do
you
mean
you
have
beaten
me
already
why
then
this
if
i
could
keep
my
promise
i
would
if
i
could
give
you
myself
i
would
failing
that
i
may
give
you
gratitude
sir
richard
i
would
give
you
gratitude
did
you
restore
this
treaty
as
it
was
for
that
new
consideration
come
now
these
savages
here
are
the
same
savages
who
once
took
that
little
island
for
you
yonder
twice
they
have
defeated
you
do
you
wish
a
third
war
you
say
england
wishes
slavery
abolished
as
you
know
texas
is
wholly
lost
to
england
the
armies
of
america
have
swept
texas
from
your
reach
for
ever
even
at
this
hour
but
if
you
give
a
new
state
in
the
north
to
these
same
savages
you
go
so
far
against
oppression
against
slavery
you
do
much
for
the
doctrine
of
england
and
her
altruism
in
the
world
sir
richard
never
did
i
believe
in
hard
bargains
and
never
did
any
great
soul
believe
in
such
i
own
to
you
that
when
i
asked
you
here
this
afternoon
i
intended
to
wheedle
from
you
all
of
oregon
north
to
degrees
forty
minutes
i
find
in
you
done
some
such
miracle
as
in
myself
neither
of
us
is
so
bad
as
the
world
has
thought
as
we
ourselves
have
thought
do
then
that
other
miracle
for
me
let
us
compose
our
quarrel
and
so
part
friends
how
do
you
mean
madam
let
us
divide
our
dispute
and
stand
on
this
treaty
as
you
wrote
it
yesterday
sir
richard
you
are
minister
with
extraordinary
powers
your
government
ratifies
your
acts
without
question
your
signature
is
binding
and
there
it
is
writ
already
on
this
scroll
see
there
are
wafers
there
on
the
table
before
you
take
them
patch
together
this
treaty
for
me
that
will
be
miracle
sir
richard
and
be
the
mending
of
our
quarrel
sir
i
offered
you
my
body
and
you
would
not
take
it
i
offer
you
my
hand
will
you
have
my
lord
i
ask
this
of
a
gentleman
of
england
it
was
not
my
right
to
hear
the
sounds
of
a
man
shame
and
humiliation
or
of
his
rising
resolve
of
his
reformed
manhood
but
i
did
hear
it
all
i
think
that
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
presently
i
heard
some
sort
of
shufflings
and
crinkling
of
paper
on
the
table
i
heard
him
sigh
as
though
he
stood
and
looked
at
his
work
his
heavy
footfalls
crossed
the
room
as
though
he
sought
hat
and
stick
her
lighter
feet
as
i
heard
followed
him
as
though
she
held
out
both
her
hands
to
him
there
was
a
pause
and
yet
another
and
so
with
a
growling
half
sob
at
last
he
passed
out
the
door
and
she
closed
it
softly
after
him
when
i
entered
she
was
standing
her
arms
spread
out
across
the
door
her
face
pale
her
eyes
large
and
dark
her
attire
still
disarrayed
on
the
table
as
i
saw
lay
a
parchment
mended
with
wafers
slowly
she
came
and
put
her
two
arms
across
my
shoulders
monsieur
she
said
monsieur
chapter
xxxv
the
proxy
of
pakenham
a
man
can
not
possess
anything
that
is
better
than
a
good
woman
nor
anything
that
is
worse
than
a
bad
when
i
reached
the
central
part
of
the
city
i
did
not
hasten
thence
to
elmhurst
mansion
instead
i
returned
to
my
hotel
i
did
not
now
care
to
see
any
of
my
friends
or
even
to
take
up
matters
of
business
with
my
chief
it
is
not
for
me
to
tell
what
feelings
came
to
me
when
i
left
helena
von
ritz
sleep
such
as
i
could
gain
reflections
such
as
were
inevitable
occupied
me
for
all
that
night
it
was
of
the
following
day
when
finally
i
once
more
sought
out
calhoun
he
had
not
expected
me
but
received
me
gladly
it
seemed
that
he
had
gone
on
about
his
own
plans
and
with
his
own
methods
the
señora
yturrio
is
doing
me
the
honor
of
an
early
morning
call
he
began
she
is
with
my
daughter
in
another
part
of
the
house
as
there
is
matter
of
some
importance
to
come
up
i
shall
ask
you
to
attend
he
despatched
a
servant
and
presently
the
lady
mentioned
joined
us
she
was
a
pleasing
picture
enough
in
her
robe
of
black
laces
and
silks
but
her
face
was
none
too
happy
and
her
eyes
it
seemed
to
me
bore
traces
either
of
unrest
or
tears
calhoun
handed
her
to
a
chair
where
she
began
to
use
her
languid
but
effective
fan
now
it
gives
us
the
greatest
regret
my
dear
señora
began
calhoun
to
have
general
almonte
and
your
husband
return
to
their
own
country
we
have
valued
their
presence
here
very
much
and
i
regret
the
disruption
of
the
friendly
relations
between
our
countries
she
made
any
sort
of
gesture
with
her
fan
and
he
went
on
it
is
the
regret
also
of
all
my
dear
lady
that
your
husband
seems
so
shamelessly
to
have
abandoned
you
i
am
quite
aware
if
you
will
allow
me
to
be
so
frank
that
you
need
some
financial
assistance
my
country
is
ruined
said
she
also
señor
i
am
ruined
as
you
say
i
have
no
means
of
life
i
have
not
even
money
to
secure
my
passage
home
that
señor
van
zandt
yes
van
zandt
did
much
for
us
through
your
agency
señora
we
have
benefited
by
that
and
i
therefore
regret
he
proved
faithless
to
you
personally
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
he
has
signified
his
wish
to
join
our
army
against
your
country
i
hear
also
that
your
late
friend
polk
has
forgotten
most
of
his
promises
to
you
him
i
hate
also
she
broke
out
he
broke
his
promise
to
señor
van
zandt
to
my
husband
to
me
calhoun
smiled
in
his
grim
fashion
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
all
that
my
dear
lady
for
you
but
point
out
a
known
characteristic
of
that
gentleman
he
has
made
me
many
promises
which
he
has
forgotten
and
offered
me
even
of
late
distinguished
honors
which
he
never
meant
me
to
accept
but
since
i
have
been
personally
responsible
for
many
of
these
things
which
have
gone
forward
i
wish
to
make
what
personal
amends
i
can
and
ever
i
shall
thank
you
for
the
good
which
you
have
done
to
this
country
believe
me
madam
you
served
your
own
country
also
in
no
ill
manner
this
situation
could
not
have
been
prevented
and
it
is
not
your
fault
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
had
you
and
i
been
left
alone
there
would
have
been
no
war
but
i
am
poor
i
have
nothing
she
rejoined
there
was
indeed
much
in
her
situation
to
excite
sympathy
it
had
been
through
her
own
act
that
negotiations
between
england
and
texas
were
broken
off
all
chance
of
mexico
to
regain
property
in
texas
was
lost
through
her
influence
with
van
zandt
now
when
all
was
done
here
she
was
deserted
even
by
those
who
had
been
her
allies
in
this
work
my
dear
señora
said
john
calhoun
becoming
less
formal
and
more
kindly
you
shall
have
funds
sufficient
to
make
you
comfortable
at
least
for
a
time
after
your
return
to
mexico
i
am
not
authorized
to
draw
upon
our
exchequer
and
you
of
course
must
prefer
all
secrecy
in
these
matters
i
regret
that
my
personal
fortune
is
not
so
large
as
it
might
be
but
in
such
measure
as
i
may
i
shall
assist
you
because
i
know
you
need
assistance
in
return
you
must
leave
this
country
the
flag
is
down
which
once
floated
over
the
house
of
mexico
here
she
hid
her
face
behind
her
fan
and
calhoun
turned
aside
señora
have
you
ever
seen
this
slipper
he
asked
suddenly
placing
upon
the
table
the
little
shoe
which
for
a
purpose
i
had
brought
with
me
and
meantime
thrown
upon
the
table
she
flashed
a
dark
look
and
did
not
speak
one
night
some
time
ago
your
husband
pursued
a
lady
across
this
town
to
get
possession
of
that
very
slipper
and
its
contents
there
was
in
the
toe
of
that
little
shoe
a
message
as
you
know
we
got
from
it
certain
information
and
therefore
devised
certain
plans
which
you
have
helped
us
to
carry
out
now
as
perhaps
you
have
had
some
personal
animus
against
the
other
lady
in
these
same
complicated
affairs
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
sending
a
special
messenger
to
ask
her
presence
here
this
morning
i
should
like
you
two
to
meet
and
if
that
be
possible
to
part
with
such
friendship
as
may
exist
in
the
premises
i
looked
suddenly
at
calhoun
it
seemed
he
was
planning
without
my
aid
yes
he
said
to
me
smiling
i
have
neglected
to
mention
to
you
that
the
baroness
von
ritz
also
is
here
in
another
apartment
of
this
place
if
you
please
i
shall
now
send
for
her
also
he
signaled
to
his
old
negro
attendant
presently
the
latter
opened
the
door
and
with
a
deep
bow
announced
the
baroness
von
ritz
who
entered
followed
closely
by
calhoun
inseparable
friend
old
doctor
ward
the
difference
in
breeding
between
these
two
women
was
to
be
seen
at
a
glance
the
doña
lucrezia
was
beautiful
in
a
way
but
lacked
the
thoroughbred
quality
which
comes
in
the
highest
types
of
womanhood
afflicted
by
nothing
but
a
somewhat
mercenary
or
personal
grief
she
showed
her
lack
of
gameness
in
adversity
on
the
other
hand
helena
von
ritz
who
had
lived
tragedy
all
her
life
and
now
was
in
the
climax
of
such
tragedy
was
smiling
and
debonaire
as
though
she
had
never
been
anything
but
wholly
content
with
life
she
was
robed
now
in
some
light
filmy
green
material
caught
up
here
and
there
on
the
shoulders
and
secured
with
silken
knots
her
white
neck
showed
her
arms
were
partly
bare
with
the
short
sleeves
of
the
time
she
stood
composed
and
easy
a
figure
fit
for
any
company
or
any
court
and
somewhat
shaming
our
little
assembly
which
never
was
a
court
at
all
only
a
private
meeting
in
the
office
of
a
discredited
and
disowned
leader
in
a
republican
government
her
costume
and
her
bearing
were
helena
von
ritz
answer
to
a
woman
fate
a
deep
color
flamed
in
her
cheeks
she
stood
with
head
erect
and
lips
smiling
brilliantly
her
curtsey
was
grace
itself
our
dingy
little
office
was
glorified
i
interrupt
you
gentlemen
she
began
on
the
contrary
i
am
sure
my
dear
lady
said
doctor
ward
senator
calhoun
told
me
he
wished
you
to
meet
señora
yturrio
yes
resumed
calhoun
i
was
just
speaking
with
this
lady
over
some
matters
concerned
with
this
little
slipper
he
smiled
as
he
held
it
up
gingerly
between
thumb
and
finger
do
you
recognize
it
madam
baroness
ah
my
little
shoe
she
exclaimed
but
see
it
has
not
been
well
cared
for
it
traveled
in
my
war
bag
from
oregon
to
washington
said
i
perhaps
bullet
molds
and
powder
flasks
may
have
damaged
it
it
still
would
serve
as
a
little
perhaps
laughed
the
baroness
but
i
think
its
days
are
done
on
such
errands
i
will
explain
something
of
these
errands
to
the
señora
yturrio
said
calhoun
i
wish
you
personally
to
say
to
that
lady
if
you
will
that
señor
yturrio
regarded
this
little
receptacle
rather
as
official
than
personal
post
for
one
moment
these
two
women
looked
at
each
other
with
that
on
their
faces
which
would
be
hard
to
describe
at
last
the
baroness
spoke
it
is
not
wholly
my
fault
señora
yturrio
if
your
husband
gave
you
cause
to
think
there
was
more
than
diplomacy
between
us
at
least
i
can
say
to
you
that
it
was
the
sport
of
it
alone
the
intrigue
if
you
please
which
interested
me
i
trust
you
will
not
accuse
me
beyond
this
a
stifled
exclamation
came
from
the
doña
lucrezia
i
have
never
seen
more
sadness
nor
yet
more
hatred
on
a
human
face
than
hers
displayed
i
have
said
that
she
was
not
thoroughbred
she
arose
now
proud
as
ever
it
is
true
but
vicious
she
declined
helena
von
ritz
outstretched
hand
and
swept
us
a
curtsey
said
she
i
go
calhoun
gravely
offered
her
an
arm
and
so
with
a
rustle
of
her
silks
there
passed
from
our
lives
one
unhappy
lady
who
helped
make
our
map
for
us
the
baroness
herself
turned
i
ought
not
to
remain
she
hesitated
madam
said
calhoun
we
can
not
spare
you
yet
she
flashed
upon
him
a
keen
look
it
is
a
young
country
said
she
but
it
raises
statesmen
you
foolish
dear
americans
one
could
have
loved
you
all
eh
what
said
doctor
ward
turning
to
her
my
dear
lady
two
of
us
are
too
old
for
that
and
as
for
the
other
he
did
not
know
how
hard
this
chance
remark
might
smite
but
as
usual
helena
von
ritz
was
brave
and
smiling
you
are
men
said
she
such
as
we
do
not
have
in
our
courts
of
europe
men
and
women
that
is
what
this
country
produces
madam
said
calhoun
i
myself
am
a
very
poor
sort
of
man
i
am
old
and
i
fail
from
month
to
month
i
can
not
live
long
at
best
what
you
see
in
me
is
simply
a
purpose
a
purpose
to
accomplish
something
for
my
country
a
purpose
which
my
country
itself
does
not
desire
to
see
fulfilled
republics
do
not
reward
us
what
say
shall
be
our
chief
reward
i
have
asked
you
here
also
to
accept
the
thanks
of
all
of
us
who
know
the
intricacies
of
the
events
which
have
gone
forward
madam
we
owe
you
texas
was
not
yonder
lady
but
yourself
who
first
advised
of
the
danger
that
threatened
us
hers
was
after
all
a
simpler
task
than
yours
because
she
only
matched
faiths
with
van
zandt
representative
of
texas
who
had
faith
in
neither
men
women
nor
nations
had
all
gone
well
we
might
perhaps
have
owed
you
yet
more
for
oregon
would
you
like
oregon
she
asked
looking
at
him
with
the
full
glance
of
her
dark
eyes
more
than
my
life
more
than
the
life
of
myself
and
all
my
friends
and
family
more
than
all
my
fortune
his
voice
rang
clear
and
keen
as
that
of
youth
all
of
oregon
she
asked
all
we
do
not
own
all
perhaps
we
do
not
deserve
it
surely
we
could
not
expect
it
why
if
we
got
of
what
that
fellow
polk
is
claiming
we
should
do
well
enough
that
is
more
than
we
deserve
or
could
expect
with
our
army
already
at
war
on
the
southwest
england
as
we
all
know
is
planning
to
take
advantage
of
our
helplessness
in
oregon
without
further
answer
she
held
out
to
him
a
document
whose
appearance
i
at
least
recognized
i
am
but
a
woman
she
said
but
it
chances
that
i
have
been
able
to
do
this
country
perhaps
something
of
a
favor
your
assistant
trist
has
done
me
in
his
turn
a
favor
this
much
i
will
ask
permission
to
do
for
him
calhoun
long
and
trembling
fingers
were
nervously
opening
the
document
he
turned
to
her
with
eyes
blazing
with
eagerness
is
oregon
he
dropped
back
into
his
chair
yes
said
helena
von
ritz
slowly
it
is
oregon
it
is
bought
and
paid
for
it
is
yours
so
now
they
all
went
over
that
document
signed
by
none
less
than
pakenham
himself
minister
plenipotentiary
for
great
britain
that
document
exists
somewhere
in
our
archives
but
i
do
not
feel
empowered
to
make
known
its
full
text
i
would
i
had
never
need
to
set
down
as
i
have
the
cost
of
it
these
others
never
knew
that
cost
and
now
they
never
can
know
for
long
years
since
both
calhoun
and
doctor
ward
have
been
dead
and
gone
i
turned
aside
as
they
examined
the
document
which
within
the
next
few
weeks
was
to
become
public
property
the
red
wafers
which
mended
it
and
which
she
smilingly
explained
at
calhoun
demand
were
as
i
knew
not
less
than
red
drops
of
blood
in
brief
i
may
say
that
this
paper
stated
that
in
case
the
united
states
felt
disposed
to
reopen
discussions
which
polk
peremptorily
had
closed
great
britain
might
be
able
to
listen
to
a
compromise
on
the
line
of
the
parallel
this
compromise
had
three
times
been
offered
her
by
diplomacy
of
united
states
under
earlier
administrations
great
britain
stated
that
in
view
of
her
deep
and
abiding
love
of
peace
and
her
deep
and
abiding
admiration
for
america
she
would
resign
her
claim
of
all
of
oregon
down
to
the
columbia
and
more
she
would
accept
the
parallel
provided
she
might
have
free
navigation
rights
upon
the
columbia
in
fact
this
was
precisely
the
memorandum
of
agreement
which
eventually
established
the
lines
of
the
treaty
as
to
oregon
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
calhoun
is
commonly
credited
with
having
brought
about
this
treaty
and
with
having
been
author
of
its
terms
so
he
was
but
only
in
the
singular
way
which
in
these
foregoing
pages
i
have
related
states
have
their
price
texas
was
bought
by
blood
oregon
ah
we
who
own
it
ought
to
prize
it
none
of
our
territory
is
half
so
full
of
romance
none
of
it
is
half
so
clean
as
our
great
and
bodeful
far
northwest
still
young
in
its
days
of
destiny
we
should
in
time
have
had
of
oregon
perhaps
said
calhoun
at
least
that
is
the
talk
of
these
fierce
politicians
but
for
this
fresh
outbreak
on
the
southwest
there
would
have
been
a
better
chance
said
helena
von
ritz
but
i
think
as
matters
are
you
would
be
wise
to
accept
this
compromise
i
have
seen
your
men
marching
thousands
of
them
the
grandest
sight
of
this
century
or
any
other
they
give
full
base
for
this
compromise
given
another
year
and
your
rifles
and
your
plows
would
make
your
claims
still
better
but
this
is
believe
me
calhoun
i
broke
in
your
signature
must
go
on
this
how
now
why
so
anxious
my
son
because
it
is
right
calhoun
turned
to
helena
von
ritz
has
this
been
presented
to
buchanan
our
secretary
of
state
he
asked
certainly
not
it
has
been
shown
to
no
one
i
have
been
here
in
washington
working
well
working
in
secret
to
secure
this
document
for
you
i
do
this
well
i
will
be
frank
with
you
i
do
it
for
trist
he
is
my
friend
i
wish
to
say
to
you
that
he
has
been
a
faithful
i
saw
her
face
whiten
and
her
lips
shut
tight
she
swayed
a
little
as
she
stood
doctor
ward
was
at
her
side
and
assisted
her
to
a
couch
for
the
first
time
the
splendid
courage
of
helena
von
ritz
seemed
to
fail
her
she
sank
back
white
unconscious
it
these
damned
stays
john
began
doctor
ward
fiercely
she
has
fainted
here
put
her
down
so
we
bring
her
around
in
a
minute
great
jove
i
want
her
to
us
thank
her
it
splendid
work
she
has
done
for
us
but
when
presently
under
the
ministrations
of
the
old
physician
helena
von
ritz
recovered
her
consciousness
she
arose
fighting
desperately
to
pull
herself
together
and
get
back
her
splendid
courage
would
you
retire
now
madam
asked
calhoun
i
have
sent
for
my
daughter
no
no
it
is
nothing
she
said
forgive
me
it
is
only
an
old
habit
of
mine
see
i
am
quite
well
indeed
in
a
few
moments
she
had
regained
something
of
that
magnificent
energy
which
was
her
heritage
as
though
nothing
had
happened
she
arose
and
walked
swiftly
across
the
room
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
great
map
which
hung
upon
the
walls
a
strange
map
it
would
seem
to
us
across
this
she
swept
a
white
hand
i
saw
your
men
cross
this
she
said
pointing
along
the
course
of
the
great
oregon
trail
whose
detailed
path
was
then
unknown
to
our
geographers
i
saw
them
go
west
along
that
road
of
destiny
i
told
myself
that
by
virtue
of
their
courage
they
had
won
this
war
sometime
there
will
come
the
great
war
between
your
people
and
those
who
rule
them
the
people
still
will
win
she
spread
out
her
two
hands
top
and
bottom
of
the
map
all
all
ought
to
be
yours
from
the
isthmus
to
the
ice
for
the
sake
of
the
people
of
the
world
the
people
but
in
time
they
will
have
their
own
we
listened
to
her
silently
crediting
her
enthusiasm
to
her
sex
her
race
but
what
she
said
has
remained
in
one
mind
at
least
from
that
day
to
this
well
might
part
of
her
speech
remain
in
the
minds
of
people
and
rulers
alike
are
we
worth
the
price
paid
for
the
country
that
we
gained
and
when
we
shall
be
worth
that
price
what
numerals
shall
mark
our
territorial
lines
may
i
carry
this
document
to
mr
pakenham
asked
john
calhoun
at
last
touching
the
paper
on
the
table
please
no
do
not
only
be
sure
that
this
proposition
of
compromise
will
meet
with
his
acceptance
i
do
not
quite
understand
why
you
do
not
go
to
buchanan
our
secretary
of
state
because
i
pay
my
debts
she
said
simply
i
told
you
that
trist
and
i
were
comrades
i
conceived
it
might
be
some
credit
for
him
in
his
work
to
have
been
the
means
of
doing
this
much
he
shall
have
that
credit
madam
be
sure
of
that
said
john
calhoun
he
held
out
to
her
his
long
thin
bloodless
hand
madam
he
said
i
have
been
mistaken
in
many
things
my
life
will
be
written
down
as
failure
i
have
been
misjudged
but
at
least
it
shall
not
be
said
of
me
that
i
failed
to
reverence
a
woman
such
as
you
all
that
i
thought
of
you
that
first
night
i
met
you
was
more
than
true
and
did
i
not
tell
you
you
would
one
day
one
way
find
your
reward
he
did
not
know
what
he
said
but
i
knew
and
i
spoke
with
him
in
the
silence
of
my
own
heart
knowing
that
his
speech
would
be
the
same
were
his
knowledge
even
with
mine
went
on
calhoun
evening
there
is
to
be
what
we
call
a
ball
of
our
diplomacy
at
the
white
house
our
administration
knowing
that
war
is
soon
to
be
announced
in
the
country
seeks
to
make
a
little
festival
here
at
the
capital
we
whistle
to
keep
up
our
courage
we
listen
to
music
to
make
us
forget
our
consciences
night
we
dance
all
washington
will
be
there
baroness
von
ritz
a
card
will
come
to
you
she
swept
him
a
curtsey
and
gave
him
a
smile
now
as
for
me
he
continued
i
am
an
old
man
and
long
ago
danced
my
last
dance
in
public
night
all
of
us
will
be
at
the
white
house
trist
will
be
there
and
doctor
ward
and
a
certain
lady
a
miss
elisabeth
churchill
madam
whom
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
meet
you
must
not
fail
us
dear
lady
because
i
am
going
to
ask
of
you
one
favor
he
bowed
with
a
courtesy
which
might
have
come
from
generations
of
an
old
aristocracy
if
you
please
madam
i
ask
you
to
honor
me
with
your
hand
for
my
first
dance
in
years
my
last
dance
in
all
my
life
impulsively
she
held
out
both
her
hands
bowing
her
head
as
she
did
so
to
hide
her
face
two
old
gray
men
one
younger
man
took
her
hands
and
kissed
them
now
our
flag
floats
on
the
columbia
and
on
the
rio
grande
i
am
older
now
but
when
i
think
of
that
scene
i
wish
that
flag
might
float
yet
freer
and
though
the
price
were
war
itself
that
it
might
float
over
a
cleaner
and
a
nobler
people
over
cleaner
and
nobler
rulers
more
sensible
of
the
splendor
of
that
heritage
of
principle
which
should
be
ours
chapter
xxxvi
the
palo
alto
ball
a
beautiful
woman
pleases
the
eye
a
good
woman
pleases
the
heart
one
is
a
jewel
the
other
a
on
the
evening
of
that
following
day
in
may
the
sun
hung
red
and
round
over
a
distant
unknown
land
along
the
rio
grande
in
that
country
no
iron
trails
as
yet
had
come
the
magic
of
the
wire
so
recently
applied
to
the
service
of
man
was
as
yet
there
unknown
word
traveled
slowly
by
horses
and
mules
and
carts
there
came
small
news
from
that
country
half
tropic
covered
with
palms
and
crooked
dwarfed
growth
of
mesquite
and
chaparral
the
cattle
lived
in
these
dense
thickets
the
spotted
jaguar
the
wolf
the
ocelot
the
javelina
many
smaller
creatures
not
known
in
our
northern
lands
in
the
loam
along
the
stream
the
deer
left
their
tracks
mingled
with
those
of
the
wild
turkeys
and
of
countless
water
fowl
it
was
a
unknown
unvalued
land
our
flag
long
past
the
sabine
had
halted
at
the
nueces
now
it
was
to
advance
across
this
wild
region
to
the
rio
grande
thus
did
smug
james
polk
keep
his
promises
among
these
tangled
mesquite
thickets
ran
sometimes
long
bayous
made
from
the
overflow
of
the
greater
rivers
as
the
natives
call
them
tall
palms
sometimes
grew
along
the
bayous
for
the
country
is
half
tropic
again
on
the
drier
ridges
there
might
be
taller
detached
trees
heavier
forests
the
natives
call
them
in
some
such
place
as
this
where
the
trees
were
tall
there
was
fired
the
first
gun
of
our
war
in
the
southwest
there
were
strange
noises
heard
here
in
the
wilderness
followed
by
lesser
noises
and
by
human
groans
some
faces
that
night
were
upturned
to
the
moon
the
same
moon
which
swam
so
gloriously
over
washington
taylor
camped
closer
to
the
rio
grande
the
fight
was
next
to
begin
by
the
lagoon
called
the
resaca
de
la
palma
but
that
night
at
the
capital
that
same
moon
told
us
nothing
of
all
this
we
did
not
hear
the
guns
it
was
far
from
palo
alto
to
our
ports
of
galveston
or
new
orleans
our
cockaded
army
made
its
own
history
in
its
own
unreported
way
we
at
the
white
house
ball
that
night
also
made
history
in
our
own
unrecorded
way
as
our
army
was
adding
to
our
confines
on
the
southwest
so
there
were
other
though
secret
forces
which
added
to
our
territory
in
the
far
northwest
as
to
this
and
as
to
the
means
by
which
it
came
about
i
have
already
been
somewhat
plain
it
was
a
goodly
company
that
assembled
for
the
grand
ball
the
first
one
in
the
second
season
of
polk
somewhat
confused
and
discordant
administration
social
matters
had
started
off
dour
enough
polk
was
herself
of
strict
religious
practice
and
i
imagine
it
had
taken
somewhat
of
finesse
to
get
her
consent
to
these
festivities
it
was
called
sometimes
the
diplomats
ball
at
least
there
was
diplomacy
back
of
it
it
was
mere
accident
which
set
this
celebration
upon
the
very
evening
of
the
battle
of
palo
alto
may
eighth
by
ten
there
were
many
in
the
great
room
which
had
been
made
ready
for
the
dancing
and
rather
a
brave
company
it
might
have
been
called
we
had
at
least
the
splendor
of
the
foreign
diplomats
uniforms
for
our
background
and
to
this
we
added
the
bravest
of
our
attire
each
one
in
his
own
individual
fashion
i
fear
thus
my
friend
jack
dandridge
was
wholly
resplendent
in
a
new
waistcoat
of
his
own
devising
and
an
evening
coat
which
almost
swept
the
floor
as
he
executed
the
evolutions
of
his
western
style
of
dancing
other
gentlemen
were
perhaps
more
grave
and
staid
we
had
with
us
at
least
one
man
old
in
government
service
who
dared
the
silk
stockings
and
knee
breeches
of
an
earlier
generation
yet
another
wore
the
white
powdered
queue
which
might
have
been
more
suited
for
his
grandfather
the
younger
men
of
the
day
wore
their
hair
long
in
fashion
quite
different
yet
this
did
not
detract
from
the
distinction
of
some
of
the
faces
which
one
might
have
seen
among
them
some
of
them
to
sleep
all
too
soon
upturned
to
the
moon
in
another
and
yet
more
bitter
war
aftermath
of
this
with
mexico
the
tall
stock
was
still
in
evidence
at
that
time
and
the
ruffled
shirts
gave
something
of
a
formal
and
touch
to
the
assembly
such
as
they
were
in
their
somewhat
varied
but
not
uninteresting
attire
the
best
of
washington
were
present
invitation
was
wholly
by
card
some
said
that
polk
wrote
these
invitations
in
her
own
hand
though
this
we
may
be
permitted
to
doubt
whatever
might
have
been
said
as
to
the
democratic
appearance
of
our
gentlemen
in
washington
our
women
were
always
our
great
reliance
and
these
at
least
never
failed
to
meet
the
approval
of
the
most
sneering
of
our
foreign
visitors
thus
we
had
present
that
night
as
i
remember
two
young
girls
both
later
to
become
famous
in
washington
society
tall
and
slender
young
térèse
chalfant
later
to
become
pugh
of
ohio
and
to
receive
at
the
hands
of
denmark
minister
who
knelt
before
her
at
a
later
public
ball
that
jeweled
clasp
which
his
wife
had
bade
him
present
to
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
found
in
america
here
also
was
miss
harriet
williams
of
georgetown
later
to
become
the
second
wife
of
that
baron
bodisco
of
russia
who
had
represented
his
government
with
us
since
the
year
a
tall
robust
blonde
lady
she
later
grew
to
be
brown
hotel
home
of
many
of
our
statesmen
and
their
ladies
turned
out
a
full
complement
clay
was
there
smiling
though
i
fear
none
too
happy
edward
everett
as
it
chanced
was
with
us
at
that
time
we
had
sam
houston
of
texas
who
would
not
until
he
appeared
upon
the
floor
relinquish
the
striped
blanket
which
distinguished
him
though
a
splendid
figure
of
a
man
he
appeared
when
he
paced
forth
in
evening
dress
a
part
of
which
was
a
waistcoat
embroidered
in
such
fancy
as
might
have
delighted
the
eye
of
his
erstwhile
indian
wife
had
she
been
there
to
see
it
here
and
there
scattered
about
the
floor
there
might
have
been
seen
many
of
the
public
figures
of
america
at
that
time
men
from
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
and
from
many
other
nations
beside
our
own
under
polk
social
administration
we
did
not
waltz
but
our
ball
began
with
a
stately
march
really
a
grand
procession
in
its
way
distinctly
interesting
in
scarlet
and
gold
and
blue
and
silks
and
all
the
flowered
circumstance
of
brocades
and
laces
of
our
ladies
and
after
our
march
we
had
our
own
polite
virginia
reel
merry
as
any
dance
yet
stately
too
i
was
late
in
arriving
that
night
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
was
but
my
second
day
in
town
and
i
had
had
small
chance
to
take
my
chief
advice
and
to
make
myself
presentable
for
an
occasion
such
as
this
i
was
fresh
from
my
tailor
and
very
when
i
entered
the
room
i
came
just
in
time
to
see
what
i
was
glad
to
see
that
is
to
say
the
keeping
of
john
calhoun
promise
to
helena
von
ritz
it
was
not
to
be
denied
that
there
had
been
talk
regarding
this
lady
and
that
calhoun
knew
it
though
not
from
me
much
of
it
was
idle
talk
based
largely
upon
her
mysterious
life
beyond
that
a
woman
beautiful
as
she
has
many
enemies
among
her
sex
there
were
dark
glances
for
her
that
night
i
do
not
deny
before
calhoun
changed
them
for
however
john
calhoun
was
rated
by
his
enemies
the
worst
of
these
knew
well
his
austerely
spotless
private
life
and
his
scrupulous
concern
for
decorum
beautiful
she
surely
was
her
ball
gown
was
of
light
golden
stuff
and
there
was
a
coral
wreath
upon
her
hair
and
her
dancing
slippers
were
of
coral
hue
there
was
no
more
striking
figure
upon
the
floor
than
she
jewels
blazed
at
her
throat
and
caught
here
and
there
the
filmy
folds
of
her
gown
she
was
radiant
beautiful
apparently
happy
she
came
mysteriously
enough
but
i
knew
that
calhoun
carriage
had
been
sent
for
her
i
learned
also
that
he
had
waited
for
her
arrival
as
i
first
saw
helena
von
ritz
there
stood
by
her
side
doctor
samuel
ward
his
square
and
stocky
figure
not
undignified
in
his
dancing
dress
the
stiff
gray
mane
of
his
hair
waggling
after
its
custom
as
he
spoke
emphatically
over
something
with
her
a
gruff
man
doctor
ward
but
under
his
gray
mane
there
was
a
clear
brain
and
in
his
broad
breast
there
beat
a
large
and
kindly
heart
even
as
i
began
to
edge
my
way
towards
these
two
i
saw
calhoun
himself
approach
tall
gray
and
thin
he
was
very
pale
that
night
and
i
knew
well
enough
what
effort
it
cost
him
to
attend
any
of
these
functions
yet
he
bowed
with
the
grace
of
a
younger
man
and
offered
the
baroness
an
arm
then
methinks
all
washington
gasped
a
bit
not
all
washington
knew
what
had
gone
forward
between
these
two
not
all
washington
knew
what
that
couple
meant
as
they
marched
in
the
grand
procession
that
night
what
they
meant
for
america
of
all
those
who
saw
i
alone
understood
so
they
danced
he
with
the
dignity
of
his
years
she
with
the
grace
which
was
the
perfection
of
dancing
the
perfection
of
courtesy
and
of
dignity
also
as
though
she
knew
and
valued
to
the
full
what
was
offered
to
her
now
by
john
calhoun
grave
sweet
and
sad
helena
von
ritz
seemed
to
me
that
night
she
was
wholly
unconscious
of
those
who
looked
and
whispered
her
face
was
pale
and
rapt
as
that
of
some
devotee
polk
himself
stood
apart
and
plainly
enough
saw
this
little
matter
go
forward
when
calhoun
approached
with
the
baroness
von
ritz
upon
his
arm
polk
was
too
much
politician
to
hesitate
or
to
inquire
he
knew
that
it
was
safe
to
follow
where
john
calhoun
led
these
two
conversed
for
a
few
moments
thus
i
fancy
helena
von
ritz
had
her
first
and
last
acquaintance
with
one
of
our
politicians
to
whom
fate
gave
far
more
than
his
deserts
it
was
the
fortune
of
polk
to
gain
for
this
country
texas
california
and
oregon
not
one
of
them
by
desert
of
his
own
my
heart
has
often
been
bitter
when
i
have
recalled
that
little
scene
politics
so
unscrupulous
can
not
always
have
a
john
calhoun
a
helena
von
ritz
to
correct
guard
and
guide
after
this
the
card
of
helena
von
ritz
might
well
enough
indeed
been
full
had
she
cared
further
to
dance
she
excused
herself
gracefully
saying
that
after
the
honor
which
had
been
done
her
she
could
not
ask
more
still
washington
buzzed
somewhat
of
europe
as
well
that
might
have
been
called
the
triumph
of
helena
von
ritz
she
felt
it
not
but
i
could
see
that
she
gloried
in
some
other
thing
i
approached
her
as
soon
as
possible
i
am
about
to
go
she
said
say
to
me
now
here
we
shall
not
meet
again
say
to
me
now
quickly
my
father
and
i
are
going
to
leave
the
treaty
for
oregon
is
prepared
now
i
am
done
yes
tell
me
i
will
not
say
it
said
i
i
can
not
she
smiled
at
me
others
might
see
her
lips
her
smile
i
saw
what
was
in
her
eyes
we
must
not
be
selfish
said
she
come
i
must
go
do
not
go
i
insisted
wait
she
caught
my
meaning
surely
she
said
i
will
stay
a
little
longer
for
that
one
thing
yes
i
wish
to
see
her
again
miss
elisabeth
churchill
i
hated
her
i
wish
that
i
might
love
her
now
do
you
know
would
would
she
let
me
if
she
knew
they
say
that
love
is
not
possible
between
women
said
i
for
my
own
part
i
wish
with
you
she
interrupted
with
a
light
tap
of
her
fan
upon
my
arm
look
is
not
that
she
i
turned
a
little
circle
of
people
were
bowing
before
polk
who
held
a
sort
of
levee
at
one
side
of
the
hall
i
saw
the
tall
young
girl
who
at
the
moment
swept
a
graceful
curtsey
to
the
president
my
heart
sprang
to
my
mouth
yes
it
was
elisabeth
ah
yes
there
flamed
up
on
the
altar
of
my
heart
the
one
fire
lit
long
ago
for
her
so
we
came
now
to
meet
silently
with
small
show
in
such
way
as
to
thrill
none
but
our
two
selves
she
too
had
served
and
that
largely
and
my
constant
altar
fire
had
done
its
part
also
strangely
in
all
this
long
coil
of
large
events
love
ah
true
love
wins
and
rules
it
makes
our
maps
it
makes
our
world
among
all
these
distinguished
men
these
beautiful
women
she
had
her
own
tribute
of
admiration
i
felt
rather
than
saw
that
she
was
in
some
pale
filmy
green
some
crêpe
of
china
with
skirts
and
sleeves
looped
up
with
pearls
in
her
hair
were
green
leaves
simple
and
sweet
and
cool
to
me
she
seemed
graver
sweeter
than
when
i
last
had
seen
her
i
say
my
heart
came
up
into
my
throat
all
i
could
think
was
that
i
wanted
to
take
her
into
my
arms
all
i
did
was
to
stand
and
stare
my
companion
was
more
expert
in
social
maneuvers
she
waited
until
the
crowd
had
somewhat
thinned
about
the
young
lady
and
her
escort
i
saw
now
with
certain
qualms
that
this
latter
was
none
other
than
my
whilom
friend
jack
dandridge
for
a
wonder
he
was
most
unduly
sober
and
he
made
as
i
have
said
no
bad
figure
in
his
finery
he
was
very
merry
and
just
a
trifle
loud
of
speech
but
being
very
intimate
in
household
he
was
warmly
welcomed
by
that
gentleman
and
by
all
around
him
she
is
beautiful
i
heard
the
lady
at
my
arm
whisper
is
she
beautiful
to
you
i
asked
very
beautiful
i
heard
her
catch
her
breath
she
is
good
i
wish
i
could
love
her
i
wish
i
wish
i
saw
her
hands
beat
together
as
they
did
when
she
was
agitated
i
turned
then
to
look
at
her
and
what
i
saw
left
me
silent
come
said
i
at
last
let
us
go
to
her
we
edged
across
the
floor
when
elisabeth
saw
me
she
straightened
a
pallor
came
across
her
face
it
was
not
her
way
to
betray
much
of
her
emotions
if
her
head
was
a
trifle
more
erect
if
indeed
she
paled
she
too
lacked
not
in
quiet
she
waited
with
wide
straight
eyes
fixed
upon
me
i
found
myself
unable
to
make
much
intelligent
speech
i
turned
to
see
helena
von
ritz
gazing
with
wistful
eyes
at
elisabeth
and
i
saw
the
eyes
of
elisabeth
make
some
answer
so
they
spoke
some
language
which
i
suppose
men
never
will
understand
the
language
of
one
woman
to
another
i
have
known
few
happier
moments
in
my
life
than
that
perhaps
after
all
i
caught
something
of
the
speech
between
their
eyes
perhaps
not
all
cheap
and
cynical
maxims
are
true
at
least
when
applied
to
noble
women
elisabeth
regained
her
wonted
color
and
more
i
was
very
wrong
in
many
ways
i
heard
her
whisper
for
almost
the
first
time
i
saw
her
perturbed
helena
von
ritz
stepped
close
to
her
amid
the
crash
of
the
reeds
and
brasses
amid
all
the
broken
conversation
which
swept
around
us
i
knew
what
she
said
low
down
in
the
flounces
of
the
wide
embroidered
silks
i
saw
their
two
hands
meet
silently
and
cling
this
made
me
happy
of
course
it
was
jack
dandridge
who
broke
in
between
us
ah
said
he
you
jealous
beggar
could
you
not
leave
me
to
be
happy
for
one
minute
here
you
come
back
a
mere
heathen
and
proceed
to
monopolize
all
our
ladies
i
have
been
making
the
most
of
my
time
you
see
i
have
proposed
half
a
dozen
times
more
to
miss
elisabeth
have
i
not
has
she
given
you
any
answer
i
asked
him
smiling
the
same
answer
jack
said
i
i
ought
to
call
you
out
do
said
he
i
do
want
to
be
called
out
i
am
getting
found
out
that
worse
well
miss
elisabeth
may
i
be
the
first
to
congratulate
i
am
glad
said
i
with
just
a
slight
trace
of
severity
that
you
have
managed
again
to
get
into
the
good
graces
of
elmhurst
when
i
last
saw
you
i
was
not
sure
that
either
of
us
would
ever
be
invited
there
again
been
there
every
sunday
regularly
since
you
went
away
said
jack
i
am
not
one
of
the
family
in
one
way
and
in
another
way
i
am
honestly
i
have
tried
my
best
to
cut
you
out
not
that
you
have
not
played
your
game
well
enough
but
there
never
was
a
game
played
so
well
that
some
other
fellow
could
not
win
by
coppering
it
so
i
coppered
everything
you
did
played
it
for
just
the
reverse
no
go
lost
even
that
way
and
i
thought
were
the
most
perennial
fool
of
your
age
and
generation
i
checked
as
gently
as
i
could
a
joviality
which
i
thought
unsuited
to
the
time
dandridge
said
i
to
him
you
know
the
baroness
von
ritz
certainly
the
of
our
bungled
wedding
of
course
i
know
her
i
only
want
to
say
i
remarked
that
the
baroness
von
ritz
has
that
little
shell
clasp
now
all
for
her
own
and
that
i
have
her
slipper
again
all
for
my
own
so
now
we
three
no
four
at
last
understand
one
another
do
we
not
jack
will
you
do
two
things
for
me
all
of
them
but
two
when
the
baroness
von
ritz
insists
on
her
intention
of
leaving
us
just
at
the
height
of
all
our
happiness
i
want
you
to
hand
her
to
her
carriage
in
the
second
place
i
may
need
you
again
well
what
would
any
one
think
of
that
said
jack
dandridge
i
never
knew
when
these
two
left
us
in
the
crowd
i
never
said
to
helena
von
ritz
i
did
not
catch
that
last
look
of
her
eye
i
remember
her
as
she
stood
there
that
night
grave
sweet
and
sad
i
turned
to
elisabeth
there
in
the
crash
of
the
reeds
and
brasses
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
sweet
and
bitter
conversation
all
around
us
was
the
comedy
and
the
tragedy
of
life
elisabeth
i
said
to
her
are
you
not
ashamed
she
looked
me
full
in
the
eye
no
she
said
and
smiled
i
have
never
seen
a
smile
like
elisabeth
the
end
epilogue
is
the
star
spangled
banner
o
long
may
it
wave
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
scott
on
the
night
that
miss
elisabeth
churchill
gave
me
her
hand
and
her
heart
for
ever
for
which
i
have
not
yet
ceased
to
thank
god
there
began
the
guns
of
palo
alto
later
there
came
the
fields
of
monterey
buena
vista
cerro
gordo
contreras
cherubusco
molino
del
rey
at
last
the
guns
sounded
at
the
gate
of
the
old
city
of
mexico
itself
some
of
that
fighting
i
myself
saw
but
much
of
the
time
i
was
employed
in
that
manner
of
special
work
which
had
engaged
me
for
the
last
few
years
it
was
through
calhoun
agency
that
i
reached
a
certain
importance
in
these
matters
and
so
i
was
chosen
as
the
commissioner
to
negotiate
a
peace
with
mexico
this
honor
later
proved
to
be
a
dangerous
and
questionable
one
general
scott
wanted
no
interference
of
this
kind
especially
since
he
knew
calhoun
influence
in
my
choice
he
thwarted
all
my
attempts
to
reach
the
headquarters
of
the
enemy
and
did
everything
he
could
to
secure
a
peace
of
his
own
at
the
mouth
of
the
cannon
i
could
offer
no
terms
better
than
buchanan
then
our
secretary
of
state
had
prepared
for
me
and
these
were
rejected
by
the
mexican
government
at
last
i
was
ordered
by
polk
to
state
that
we
had
no
better
terms
to
offer
and
as
for
myself
i
was
told
to
return
to
washington
at
that
time
i
could
not
make
my
way
out
through
the
lines
nor
in
truth
did
i
much
care
to
do
so
a
certain
event
not
written
in
history
influenced
me
to
remain
for
a
time
at
the
little
village
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
here
in
short
i
received
word
from
a
lady
whom
i
had
formerly
known
none
less
than
señora
yturrio
once
a
member
of
the
mexican
legation
at
washington
true
to
her
record
she
had
again
reached
influential
position
in
her
country
using
methods
of
her
own
she
told
me
now
to
pay
no
attention
to
what
had
been
reported
by
mexico
in
fact
i
was
approached
again
by
the
mexican
commissioners
introduced
by
her
what
was
done
then
is
history
we
signed
then
and
there
the
peace
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
in
accordance
with
the
terms
originally
given
me
by
our
secretary
of
state
so
after
all
calhoun
kindness
to
a
woman
in
distress
was
not
lost
and
so
after
all
he
unwittingly
helped
in
the
ending
of
the
war
he
never
wished
begun
meantime
i
had
been
recalled
to
washington
but
did
not
know
the
nature
of
that
recall
when
at
last
i
arrived
there
i
found
myself
disgraced
and
discredited
my
actions
were
repudiated
by
the
administration
i
myself
was
dismissed
from
the
service
without
pay
sad
enough
blow
for
a
young
man
who
had
been
married
less
than
a
year
polk
jealousy
of
john
calhoun
was
not
the
only
cause
of
this
calhoun
prophecy
was
right
polk
did
not
forget
his
revenge
on
me
yet
none
the
less
after
his
usual
fashion
he
was
not
averse
to
receiving
such
credit
as
he
could
he
put
the
responsibility
of
the
treaty
upon
the
senate
it
was
debated
hotly
there
for
some
weeks
and
at
last
much
to
his
surprise
and
my
gratification
it
was
ratified
the
north
which
had
opposed
this
mexican
war
that
same
war
which
later
led
inevitably
to
the
war
of
the
rebellion
now
found
itself
unable
to
say
much
against
the
great
additions
to
our
domain
which
the
treaty
had
secured
we
paid
fifteen
millions
in
addition
to
our
territorial
indemnity
claim
and
we
got
a
realm
whose
wealth
could
not
be
computed
so
much
it
must
be
owned
did
fortune
do
for
that
singular
favorite
polk
and
curiously
enough
the
smoke
had
hardly
cleared
from
palo
alto
field
before
abraham
lincoln
a
young
member
in
the
house
of
congress
was
introducing
a
resolution
which
asked
the
marking
of
the
spot
where
that
outrage
was
committed
perhaps
it
was
an
outrage
many
still
hold
it
so
but
let
us
reflect
what
would
have
been
lincoln
life
had
matters
not
gone
just
as
they
did
with
the
cessions
from
mexico
came
the
great
domain
of
california
now
look
how
strangely
history
sometimes
works
out
itself
had
there
been
any
suspicion
of
the
discovery
of
gold
in
california
neither
mexico
nor
our
republic
ever
would
have
owned
it
england
surely
would
have
taken
it
the
very
year
that
my
treaty
eventually
was
ratified
was
that
in
which
gold
was
discovered
in
california
but
it
was
too
late
then
for
england
to
interfere
too
late
then
also
for
mexico
to
claim
it
we
got
untold
millions
of
treasure
there
most
of
those
millions
went
to
the
northern
states
into
manufactures
into
commerce
the
north
owned
that
gold
and
it
was
that
gold
which
gave
the
north
the
power
to
crush
that
rebellion
which
was
born
of
the
mexican
war
that
same
rebellion
by
which
england
too
late
would
gladly
have
seen
this
union
disrupted
so
that
she
might
have
yet
another
chance
at
these
lands
she
now
had
lost
for
ever
fate
seemed
still
to
be
with
us
after
all
as
i
have
so
often
had
occasion
to
believe
may
be
a
possible
thing
that
war
of
conquest
which
calhoun
opposed
that
same
war
which
grew
out
of
the
slavery
tenets
which
he
himself
held
the
great
error
of
his
otherwise
splendid
public
life
found
its
own
correction
in
the
civil
war
it
was
the
gold
of
california
which
put
down
slavery
thenceforth
slavery
has
existed
legally
only
of
the
mason
and
dixon
line
we
have
our
problems
yet
perhaps
some
other
war
may
come
to
settle
them
fortunate
for
us
if
there
could
be
another
california
another
texas
another
oregon
to
help
us
pay
for
them
i
who
was
intimately
connected
with
many
of
these
less
known
matters
claim
for
my
master
a
reputation
wholly
different
from
that
given
to
him
in
any
garbled
history
of
his
life
i
lay
claim
in
his
name
for
foresight
beyond
that
of
any
man
of
his
time
he
made
mistakes
but
he
made
them
bravely
grandly
and
consistently
where
his
convictions
were
enlisted
he
had
no
reservations
and
he
used
every
means
every
available
weapon
as
i
have
shown
but
he
was
never
never
cheap
never
insincere
a
detester
of
all
machine
politicians
he
was
a
statesman
worthy
to
be
called
the
william
pitt
of
the
united
states
the
consistency
of
his
career
was
a
marvelous
thing
because
though
he
changed
in
his
beliefs
he
was
first
to
recognize
the
changing
conditions
of
our
country
he
failed
and
he
is
execrated
he
won
and
he
is
forgot
my
chief
calhoun
did
not
die
until
some
six
years
after
that
first
evening
when
doctor
ward
and
i
had
our
talk
with
him
he
was
said
to
have
died
of
a
disease
of
the
lungs
yet
here
again
history
is
curiously
mistaken
calhoun
slept
himself
away
i
sometimes
think
with
a
shudder
that
perhaps
this
was
the
revenge
which
nemesis
took
of
him
for
his
mistakes
his
last
days
were
dreamlike
in
their
passing
his
last
speech
in
the
senate
was
read
by
one
of
his
friends
as
doctor
ward
had
advised
him
some
said
afterwards
that
his
illness
was
that
accursed
sleeping
sickness
imported
from
africa
with
these
same
slaves
it
were
a
strange
thing
had
john
calhoun
indeed
died
of
his
error
at
least
he
slept
away
at
least
too
he
made
his
atonement
the
south
following
his
doctrines
itself
was
long
accursed
of
this
same
sleeping
sickness
but
in
the
providence
of
god
it
was
not
lost
to
us
and
is
ours
for
a
long
and
splendid
history
it
was
through
john
calhoun
a
grave
and
somber
figure
of
our
history
that
we
got
the
vast
land
of
texas
it
was
through
him
also
and
not
through
clay
nor
jackson
nor
any
of
the
northern
statesmen
who
never
could
see
a
future
for
the
west
that
we
got
all
of
our
vast
northwest
realm
within
a
few
days
after
the
palo
alto
ball
a
memorandum
of
agreement
was
signed
between
minister
pakenham
and
buchanan
our
secretary
of
state
this
was
done
at
the
instance
and
by
the
aid
of
john
calhoun
it
was
he
he
and
helena
von
ritz
who
brought
about
that
treaty
which
on
june
fifteenth
of
the
same
year
was
signed
and
gladly
signed
by
the
minister
from
great
britain
the
latter
had
been
fully
enough
impressed
such
was
the
story
by
the
reports
of
the
columns
of
our
farmers
with
rifles
leaning
at
their
wagon
seats
and
plows
lashed
to
the
calhoun
himself
never
ceased
to
regret
that
we
could
not
delay
a
year
or
two
years
longer
in
this
he
was
thwarted
by
the
impetuous
war
with
the
republic
on
the
south
although
had
that
never
been
fought
we
had
lost
california
lost
also
the
south
and
lost
the
union
under
one
form
or
other
one
name
of
government
or
another
the
flag
of
democracy
eventually
must
float
over
all
this
continent
not
a
part
but
all
of
this
country
must
be
ours
must
be
the
people
it
may
cost
more
blood
and
treasure
now
some
time
we
shall
see
the
wisdom
of
john
calhoun
but
some
time
too
i
think
we
shall
see
come
true
that
prophecy
of
a
strange
and
brilliant
mentality
which
in
presence
and
in
mine
said
that
all
of
these
northern
lands
and
all
mexico
as
well
must
one
day
be
ours
which
is
to
say
the
people
for
the
sake
of
human
opportunity
of
human
hope
and
happiness
our
battles
are
but
partly
fought
but
at
least
they
are
not
then
lost
for
myself
the
close
of
the
mexican
war
found
me
somewhat
worn
by
travel
and
illy
equipped
in
financial
matters
i
had
been
discredited
i
say
by
my
own
government
my
pay
was
withheld
elisabeth
by
that
time
my
wife
was
a
girl
reared
in
all
the
luxury
that
our
country
then
could
offer
shall
i
say
whether
or
not
i
prized
her
more
when
gladly
she
gave
up
all
this
and
joined
me
for
one
more
long
and
final
journey
out
across
that
great
trail
which
i
had
seen
the
trail
of
democracy
of
america
of
the
world
at
last
we
reached
oregon
it
holds
the
grave
of
one
of
ours
it
is
the
home
of
others
we
were
happy
we
asked
favor
of
no
man
fear
of
no
one
did
we
feel
elisabeth
has
in
her
time
slept
on
a
bed
of
husks
she
has
cooked
at
a
sooty
fireplace
of
her
own
and
at
her
cabin
door
i
myself
have
been
the
guard
we
made
our
way
by
ourselves
and
for
ourselves
as
did
those
who
conquered
america
for
our
flag
the
citizen
standing
in
the
doorway
of
his
home
shall
save
the
republic
so
wrote
a
later
pen
it
was
not
until
long
after
the
discovery
of
gold
in
california
had
set
us
all
to
thinking
that
i
was
reminded
of
the
strange
story
of
the
old
german
von
rittenhofen
of
finding
some
pieces
of
gold
while
on
one
of
his
hunts
for
butterflies
i
followed
out
his
vague
directions
as
best
i
might
we
found
gold
enough
to
make
us
rich
without
our
land
that
claim
is
staked
legally
half
of
it
awaits
an
owner
who
perhaps
will
never
come
there
are
those
who
will
accept
always
the
solemn
asseverations
of
politicians
who
by
word
of
mouth
or
pen
assert
that
this
or
that
made
our
country
wrote
its
history
such
as
they
might
smile
if
told
that
not
even
men
much
less
politicians
have
written
all
our
story
as
a
nation
yet
any
who
smile
at
woman
influence
in
american
history
do
so
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
webster
and
lord
ashburton
have
credit
for
determining
our
boundary
on
the
northeast
england
called
it
ashburton
capitulation
to
the
yankee
did
you
never
hear
the
other
gossip
england
laid
all
that
to
ashburton
american
wife
look
at
that
poor
devil
yrujo
minister
from
spain
with
us
who
saw
his
king
holdings
on
this
continent
juggled
from
hand
to
hand
between
us
all
his
wife
was
daughter
of
governor
mckean
in
pennsylvania
yonder
if
she
had
no
influence
with
her
husband
so
much
the
worse
for
her
in
important
times
a
generation
ago
genêt
of
france
as
all
know
was
the
husband
of
the
daughter
of
governor
clinton
of
new
york
did
that
hurt
our
chances
with
france
my
lord
oswald
of
great
britain
who
negotiated
our
treaty
of
peace
in
was
not
his
worldly
fortune
made
by
virtue
of
his
american
wife
all
of
us
should
remember
that
marbois
napoleon
minister
who
signed
the
great
treaty
for
him
with
us
married
his
wife
while
he
was
a
mere
here
in
washington
and
she
too
was
an
american
erskine
of
england
when
times
were
strained
in
and
later
and
our
friend
for
the
most
part
was
not
he
also
husband
of
an
american
it
was
as
john
calhoun
said
our
history
like
that
of
england
and
france
like
that
of
rome
and
troy
was
made
in
large
part
by
women
of
that
strange
woman
helena
baroness
von
ritz
i
have
never
definitely
heard
since
then
but
all
of
us
have
heard
of
that
great
uplift
of
central
europe
that
ferment
of
revolution
most
noticeable
in
germany
in
out
of
that
revolutionary
spirit
there
came
to
us
thousands
and
thousands
of
our
best
population
the
sturdiest
and
the
most
citizens
this
country
ever
had
they
gave
us
scores
of
generals
in
our
late
war
and
gave
us
at
least
one
cabinet
officer
but
whence
came
that
spirit
of
revolution
in
europe
does
it
live
grow
increase
even
now
does
it
sound
now
close
to
the
oldest
thrones
originated
that
germ
of
liberty
which
did
its
work
so
well
i
am
at
least
one
who
believes
that
i
could
guess
something
of
its
source
the
revolution
in
hungary
failed
for
the
time
kossuth
came
to
see
us
with
pleas
that
we
might
aid
hungary
but
republics
forget
we
gave
no
aid
to
hungary
i
was
far
away
and
did
not
meet
kossuth
i
should
have
been
glad
to
question
him
i
did
not
forget
helena
von
ritz
nor
doubt
that
she
worked
out
in
full
that
strange
destiny
for
which
indeed
she
was
born
and
prepared
to
which
she
devoted
herself
made
clean
by
sacrifice
she
was
not
one
to
leave
her
work
undone
she
i
know
passed
on
her
torch
of
principle
elisabeth
and
i
speak
often
of
helena
von
ritz
i
remember
her
beautiful
fascinating
compelling
pathetic
tragic
if
it
was
asked
of
her
i
know
that
she
still
paid
it
gladly
all
that
sacrifice
through
which
alone
there
can
be
worked
out
the
progress
of
humanity
under
that
idea
which
blindly
we
attempted
to
express
in
our
declaration
that
idea
which
at
times
we
may
forget
but
which
eventually
must
triumph
for
the
good
of
all
the
world
she
helped
us
make
our
map
shall
not
that
for
which
she
stood
help
us
hold
it
at
least
let
me
say
i
have
thought
this
little
story
might
be
set
down
and
though
some
may
smile
at
flags
and
principles
i
should
like
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
close
with
the
words
of
yet
another
man
of
those
earlier
times
the
old
flag
of
the
union
was
my
protector
in
infancy
and
the
pride
and
glory
of
my
riper
years
and
by
the
grace
of
god
under
its
shadow
i
shall
die
