believe
i
held
my
heart
inviolate
to
lavish
on
one
man
my
hot
the
song
of
bêlit
hoofs
drummed
down
the
street
that
sloped
to
the
wharfs
the
folk
that
yelled
and
scattered
had
only
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
a
mailed
figure
on
a
black
stallion
a
wide
scarlet
cloak
flowing
out
on
the
wind
far
up
the
street
came
the
shout
and
clatter
of
pursuit
but
the
horseman
did
not
look
back
he
swept
out
onto
the
wharfs
and
jerked
the
plunging
stallion
back
on
its
haunches
at
the
very
lip
of
the
pier
seamen
gaped
up
at
him
as
they
stood
to
the
sweep
and
striped
sail
of
a
galley
the
master
sturdy
and
stood
in
the
bows
easing
her
away
from
the
piles
with

he
yelled
angrily
as
the
horseman
sprang
from
the
saddle
and
with
a
long
leap
landed
squarely
on
the
invited
you
aboard
under
way
roared
the
intruder
with
a
fierce
gesture
that
spattered
red
drops
from
his
broadsword
we
bound
for
the
coasts
of
kush
expostulated
the
master
i
for
kush
push
off
i
tell
you
the
other
cast
a
quick
glance
up
the
street
along
which
a
squad
of
horsemen
were
galloping
far
behind
them
toiled
a
group
of
archers
crossbows
on
their
shoulders
you
pay
for
your
passage
demanded
the
master
pay
my
way
with
steel
roared
the
man
in
armor
brandishing
the
great
sword
that
glittered
bluely
in
the
sun
crom
man
if
you
do
get
under
way
i
drench
this
galley
in
the
blood
of
its
crew
the
shipmaster
was
a
good
judge
of
men
one
glance
at
the
dark
scarred
face
of
the
swordsman
hardened
with
passion
and
he
shouted
a
quick
order
thrusting
strongly
against
the
piles
the
galley
wallowed
out
into
clear
water
the
oars
began
to
clack
rhythmically
then
a
puff
of
wind
filled
the
shimmering
sail
the
light
ship
heeled
to
the
gust
then
took
her
course
like
a
swan
gathering
headway
as
she
skimmed
along
on
the
wharfs
the
riders
were
shaking
their
swords
and
shouting
threats
and
commands
that
the
ship
put
about
and
yelling
for
the
bowmen
to
hasten
before
the
craft
was
out
of
arbalest
range
them
rave
grinned
the
swordsman
hardily
you
keep
her
on
her
course
master
steersman
the
master
descended
from
the
small
deck
between
the
bows
made
his
way
between
the
rows
of
oarsmen
and
mounted
the
the
stranger
stood
there
with
his
back
to
the
mast
eyes
narrowed
alertly
sword
ready
the
shipman
eyed
him
steadily
careful
not
to
make
any
move
toward
the
long
knife
in
his
belt
he
saw
a
tall
powerfully
built
figure
in
a
black
hauberk
burnished
greaves
and
a
helmet
from
which
jutted
bull
horns
highly
polished
from
the
mailed
shoulders
fell
the
scarlet
cloak
blowing
in
the
a
broad
shagreen
belt
with
a
golden
buckle
held
the
scabbard
of
the
broadsword
he
bore
under
the
horned
helmet
a
black
mane
contrasted
with
smoldering
blue
eyes
we
must
travel
together
said
the
master
may
as
well
be
at
peace
with
each
other
my
name
is
tito
licensed
of
the
ports
of
argos
i
am
bound
for
kush
to
trade
beads
and
silks
and
sugar
and
swords
to
the
black
kings
for
ivory
copra
copper
ore
slaves
and
pearls
the
swordsman
glanced
back
at
the
rapidly
receding
docks
where
the
figures
still
gesticulated
helplessly
evidently
having
trouble
in
finding
a
boat
swift
enough
to
overhaul
the
galley
am
conan
a
cimmerian
he
answered
came
into
argos
seeking
employment
but
with
no
wars
forward
there
was
nothing
to
which
i
might
turn
my
hand
do
the
guardsmen
pursue
you
asked
tito
that
it
any
of
my
business
but
i
thought
perhaps
nothing
to
conceal
replied
the
cimmerian
crom
though
spent
considerable
time
among
you
civilized
peoples
your
ways
are
still
beyond
my
comprehension
last
night
in
a
tavern
a
captain
in
the
king
guard
offered
violence
to
the
sweetheart
of
a
young
soldier
who
naturally
ran
him
through
but
it
seems
there
is
some
cursed
law
against
killing
guardsmen
and
the
boy
and
his
girl
fled
away
it
was
bruited
about
that
i
was
seen
with
them
and
so
today
i
was
haled
into
court
and
a
judge
asked
me
where
the
lad
had
gone
i
replied
that
since
he
was
a
friend
of
mine
i
could
not
betray
him
then
the
court
waxed
wrath
and
the
judge
talked
a
great
deal
about
my
duty
to
the
state
and
society
and
other
things
i
did
not
understand
and
bade
me
tell
where
my
friend
had
flown
by
this
time
i
was
becoming
wrathful
myself
for
i
had
explained
my
position
i
choked
my
ire
and
held
my
peace
and
the
judge
squalled
that
i
had
shown
contempt
for
the
court
and
that
i
should
be
hurled
into
a
dungeon
to
rot
until
i
betrayed
my
friend
so
then
seeing
they
were
all
mad
i
drew
my
sword
and
cleft
the
judge
skull
then
i
cut
my
way
out
of
the
court
and
seeing
the
high
constable
stallion
tied
near
by
i
rode
for
the
wharfs
where
i
thought
to
find
a
ship
bound
for
foreign
parts
said
tito
hardily
courts
have
fleeced
me
too
often
in
suits
with
rich
merchants
for
me
to
owe
them
any
love
i
have
questions
to
answer
if
i
ever
anchor
in
that
port
again
but
i
can
prove
i
acted
under
compulsion
you
may
as
well
put
up
your
sword
peaceable
sailors
and
have
nothing
against
you
besides
it
as
well
to
have
a
like
yourself
on
board
come
up
to
the
and
we
have
a
tankard
of
ale
enough
readily
responded
the
cimmerian
sheathing
his
sword
the
was
a
small
sturdy
ship
typical
of
those
which
ply
between
the
ports
of
zingara
and
argos
and
the
southern
coasts
hugging
the
shoreline
and
seldom
venturing
far
into
the
open
ocean
it
was
high
of
stern
with
a
tall
curving
prow
broad
in
the
waist
sloping
beautifully
to
stem
and
stern
it
was
guided
by
the
long
sweep
from
the
poop
and
propulsion
was
furnished
mainly
by
the
broad
striped
silk
sail
aided
by
a
jibsail
the
oars
were
for
use
in
tacking
out
of
creeks
and
bays
and
during
calms
there
were
ten
to
the
side
five
fore
and
five
aft
of
the
small
the
most
precious
part
of
the
cargo
was
lashed
under
this
deck
and
under
the
the
men
slept
on
deck
or
between
the
rowers
benches
protected
in
bad
weather
by
canopies
with
twenty
men
at
the
oars
three
at
the
sweep
and
the
shipmaster
the
crew
was
complete
so
the
pushed
steadily
southward
with
consistently
fair
weather
the
sun
beat
down
from
day
to
day
with
fiercer
heat
and
the
canopies
were
run
up
striped
silken
cloths
that
matched
the
shimmering
sail
and
the
shining
goldwork
on
the
prow
and
along
the
gunwales
they
sighted
the
coast
of
shem
long
rolling
meadowlands
with
the
white
crowns
of
the
towers
of
cities
in
the
distance
and
horsemen
with
beards
and
hooked
noses
who
sat
their
steeds
along
the
shore
and
eyed
the
galley
with
suspicion
she
did
not
put
in
there
was
scant
profit
in
trade
with
the
sons
of
shem
nor
did
master
tito
pull
into
the
broad
bay
where
the
styx
river
emptied
its
gigantic
flood
into
the
ocean
and
the
massive
black
castles
of
khemi
loomed
over
the
blue
waters
ships
did
not
put
unasked
into
this
port
where
dusky
sorcerers
wove
awful
spells
in
the
murk
of
sacrificial
smoke
mounting
eternally
from
altars
where
naked
women
screamed
and
where
set
the
old
serpent
of
the
hyborians
but
god
of
the
stygians
was
said
to
writhe
his
shining
coils
among
his
worshippers
master
tito
gave
that
dreamy
bay
a
wide
berth
even
when
a
gondola
shot
from
behind
a
castellated
point
of
land
and
naked
dusky
women
with
great
red
blossoms
in
their
hair
stood
and
called
to
his
sailors
and
posed
and
postured
brazenly
now
no
more
shining
towers
rose
inland
they
had
passed
the
southern
borders
of
stygia
and
were
cruising
along
the
coasts
of
kush
the
sea
and
the
ways
of
the
sea
were
mysteries
to
conan
whose
homeland
was
among
the
high
hills
of
the
northern
uplands
the
wanderer
was
no
less
of
interest
to
the
sturdy
seamen
few
of
whom
had
ever
seen
one
of
his
race
they
were
characteristic
argosean
sailors
short
and
stockily
built
conan
towered
above
them
and
no
two
of
them
could
match
his
strength
they
were
hardy
and
robust
but
his
was
the
endurance
and
vitality
of
a
wolf
his
thews
steeled
and
his
nerves
whetted
by
the
hardness
of
his
life
in
the
world
wastelands
he
was
quick
to
laugh
quick
and
terrible
in
his
wrath
he
was
a
valiant
trencherman
and
strong
drink
was
a
passion
and
a
weakness
with
him
naïve
as
a
child
in
many
ways
unfamiliar
with
the
sophistry
of
civilization
he
was
naturally
intelligent
jealous
of
his
rights
and
dangerous
as
a
hungry
tiger
young
in
years
he
was
hardened
in
warfare
and
wandering
and
his
sojourns
in
many
lands
were
evident
in
his
apparel
his
horned
helmet
was
such
as
was
worn
by
the
æsir
of
nordheim
his
hauberk
and
greaves
were
of
the
finest
workmanship
of
koth
the
fine
which
sheathed
his
arms
and
legs
was
of
nemedia
the
blade
at
his
girdle
was
a
great
aquilonian
broadsword
and
his
gorgeous
scarlet
cloak
could
have
been
spun
nowhere
but
in
ophir
so
they
beat
southward
and
master
tito
began
to
look
for
the
villages
of
the
black
people
but
they
found
only
smoking
ruins
on
the
shore
of
a
bay
littered
with
naked
black
bodies
tito
swore
had
good
trade
here
aforetime
this
is
the
work
of
pirates
if
we
meet
them
conan
loosened
his
great
blade
in
its
scabbard
is
no
warship
we
run
not
fight
yet
if
it
came
to
a
pinch
we
have
beaten
off
reavers
before
and
might
do
it
again
unless
it
were
bêlit
is
bêlit
wildest
unhanged
unless
i
read
the
signs
it
was
her
butchers
who
destroyed
that
village
on
the
bay
may
i
some
day
see
her
dangling
from
the
she
is
called
the
queen
of
the
black
coast
she
is
a
shemite
woman
who
leads
black
raiders
they
harry
the
shipping
and
have
sent
many
a
good
tradesman
to
the
bottom
from
under
the
tito
brought
out
quilted
jerkins
steel
caps
bows
and
arrows
use
to
resist
if
we
run
down
he
grunted
it
rasps
the
soul
to
give
up
life
without
a
struggle
it
was
just
at
sunrise
when
the
lookout
shouted
a
warning
around
the
long
point
of
an
island
off
the
starboard
bow
glided
a
long
lethal
shape
a
slender
serpentine
galley
with
a
raised
deck
that
ran
from
stem
to
stern
forty
oars
on
each
side
drove
her
swiftly
through
the
water
and
the
low
rail
swarmed
with
naked
blacks
that
chanted
and
clashed
spears
on
oval
shields
from
the
masthead
floated
a
long
crimson
pennon
yelled
tito
paling
put
her
about
into
that
if
we
can
beach
her
before
they
run
us
down
we
have
a
chance
to
escape
with
our
lives
so
veering
sharply
the
ran
for
the
line
of
surf
that
boomed
along
the
shore
tito
striding
back
and
forth
exhorting
the
panting
rowers
to
greater
efforts
the
master
black
beard
bristled
his
eyes
glared
me
a
bow
requested
conan
not
my
idea
of
a
manly
weapon
but
i
learned
archery
among
the
hyrkanians
and
it
will
go
hard
if
i
ca
feather
a
man
or
so
on
yonder
deck
standing
on
the
poop
he
watched
the
ship
skimming
lightly
over
the
waters
and
landsman
though
he
was
it
was
evident
to
him
that
the
would
never
win
that
race
already
arrows
arching
from
the
pirate
deck
were
falling
with
a
hiss
into
the
sea
not
twenty
paces
astern
best
stand
to
it
growled
the
cimmerian
we
all
die
with
shafts
in
our
backs
and
not
a
blow
dealt
to
it
dogs
roared
tito
with
a
passionate
gesture
of
his
brawny
fist
the
bearded
rowers
grunted
heaved
at
the
oars
while
their
muscles
coiled
and
knotted
and
sweat
started
out
on
their
hides
the
timbers
of
the
stout
little
galley
creaked
and
groaned
as
the
men
fairly
ripped
her
through
the
water
the
wind
had
fallen
the
sail
hung
limp
nearer
crept
the
inexorable
raiders
and
they
were
still
a
good
mile
from
the
surf
when
one
of
the
steersmen
fell
gagging
across
a
sweep
a
long
arrow
through
his
neck
tito
sprang
to
take
his
place
and
conan
bracing
his
feet
wide
on
the
heaving
lifted
his
bow
he
could
see
the
details
of
the
pirate
plainly
now
the
rowers
were
protected
by
a
line
of
raised
mantelets
along
the
sides
but
the
warriors
dancing
on
the
narrow
deck
were
in
full
view
these
were
painted
and
plumed
and
mostly
naked
brandishing
spears
and
spotted
shields
on
the
raised
platform
in
the
bows
stood
a
slim
figure
whose
white
skin
glistened
in
dazzling
contrast
to
the
glossy
ebon
hides
about
it
bêlit
without
a
doubt
conan
drew
the
shaft
to
his
ear
then
some
whim
or
qualm
stayed
his
hand
and
sent
the
arrow
through
the
body
of
a
tall
plumed
spearman
beside
her
hand
over
hand
the
pirate
galley
was
overhauling
the
lighter
ship
arrows
fell
in
a
rain
about
the
and
men
cried
out
all
the
steersmen
were
down
pincushioned
and
tito
was
handling
the
massive
sweep
alone
gasping
black
curses
his
braced
legs
knots
of
straining
thews
then
with
a
sob
he
sank
down
a
long
shaft
quivering
in
his
sturdy
heart
the
lost
headway
and
rolled
in
the
swell
the
men
shouted
in
confusion
and
conan
took
command
in
characteristic
fashion
lads
he
roared
loosing
with
a
vicious
twang
of
cord
your
steel
and
give
these
dogs
a
few
knocks
before
they
cut
our
throats
useless
to
bend
your
backs
any
more
they
board
us
ere
we
can
row
another
fifty
paces
in
desperation
the
sailors
abandoned
their
oars
and
snatched
up
their
weapons
it
was
valiant
but
useless
they
had
time
for
one
flight
of
arrows
before
the
pirate
was
upon
them
with
no
one
at
the
sweep
the
rolled
broadside
and
the
prow
of
the
raider
crashed
into
her
amidships
crunched
into
the
side
from
the
lofty
gunwales
the
black
pirates
drove
down
a
volley
of
shafts
that
tore
through
the
quilted
jackets
of
the
doomed
sailormen
then
sprang
down
spear
in
hand
to
complete
the
slaughter
on
the
deck
of
the
pirate
lay
half
a
dozen
bodies
an
earnest
of
conan
archery
the
fight
on
the
was
short
and
bloody
the
stocky
sailors
no
match
for
the
tall
barbarians
were
cut
down
to
a
man
elsewhere
the
battle
had
taken
a
peculiar
turn
conan
on
the
poop
was
on
a
level
with
the
pirate
deck
as
the
steel
prow
slashed
into
the
he
braced
himself
and
kept
his
feet
under
the
shock
casting
away
his
bow
a
tall
corsair
bounding
over
the
rail
was
met
in
midair
by
the
cimmerian
great
sword
which
sheared
him
cleanly
through
the
torso
so
that
his
body
fell
one
way
and
his
legs
another
then
with
a
burst
of
fury
that
left
a
heap
of
mangled
corpses
along
the
gunwales
conan
was
over
the
rail
and
on
the
deck
of
the
in
an
instant
he
was
the
center
of
a
hurricane
of
stabbing
spears
and
lashing
clubs
but
he
moved
in
a
blinding
blur
of
steel
spears
bent
on
his
armor
or
swished
empty
air
and
his
sword
sang
its
the
of
his
race
was
upon
him
and
with
a
red
mist
of
unreasoning
fury
wavering
before
his
blazing
eyes
he
cleft
skulls
smashed
breasts
severed
limbs
ripped
out
entrails
and
littered
the
deck
like
a
shambles
with
a
ghastly
harvest
of
brains
and
blood
invulnerable
in
his
armor
his
back
against
the
mast
he
heaped
mangled
corpses
at
his
feet
until
his
enemies
gave
back
panting
in
rage
and
fear
then
as
they
lifted
their
spears
to
cast
them
and
he
tensed
himself
to
leap
and
die
in
the
midst
of
them
a
shrill
cry
froze
the
lifted
arms
they
stood
like
statues
the
black
giants
poised
for
the
the
mailed
swordsman
with
his
dripping
blade
bêlit
sprang
before
the
blacks
beating
down
their
spears
she
turned
toward
conan
her
bosom
heaving
her
eyes
flashing
fierce
fingers
of
wonder
caught
at
his
heart
she
was
slender
yet
formed
like
a
goddess
at
once
lithe
and
voluptuous
her
only
garment
was
a
broad
silken
girdle
her
white
ivory
limbs
and
the
ivory
globes
of
her
breasts
drove
a
beat
of
fierce
passion
through
the
cimmerian
pulse
even
in
the
panting
fury
of
battle
her
rich
black
hair
black
as
a
stygian
night
fell
in
rippling
burnished
clusters
down
her
supple
back
her
dark
eyes
burned
on
the
cimmerian
she
was
untamed
as
a
desert
wind
supple
and
dangerous
as
a
she
came
close
to
him
heedless
of
his
great
blade
dripping
with
blood
of
her
warriors
her
supple
thigh
brushed
against
it
so
close
she
came
to
the
tall
warrior
her
red
lips
parted
as
she
stared
up
into
his
somber
menacing
eyes
are
you
she
demanded
ishtar
i
have
never
seen
your
like
though
i
have
ranged
the
sea
from
the
coasts
of
zingara
to
the
fires
of
the
ultimate
south
whence
come
you
argos
he
answered
shortly
alert
for
treachery
let
her
slim
hand
move
toward
the
jeweled
dagger
in
her
girdle
and
a
buffet
of
his
open
hand
would
stretch
her
senseless
on
the
deck
yet
in
his
heart
he
did
not
fear
he
had
held
too
many
women
civilized
or
barbaric
in
his
arms
not
to
recognize
the
light
that
burned
in
the
eyes
of
this
one
are
no
soft
hyborian
she
exclaimed
are
fierce
and
hard
as
a
gray
wolf
those
eyes
were
never
dimmed
by
city
lights
those
thews
were
never
softened
by
life
amid
marble
walls
am
conan
a
cimmerian
he
answered
to
the
people
of
the
exotic
climes
the
north
was
a
mazy
realm
peopled
with
ferocious
giants
who
occasionally
descended
from
their
icy
fastnesses
with
torch
and
sword
their
raids
had
never
taken
them
as
far
south
as
shem
and
this
daughter
of
shem
made
no
distinction
between
æsir
vanir
or
cimmerian
with
the
unerring
instinct
of
the
elemental
feminine
she
knew
she
had
found
her
lover
and
his
race
meant
naught
save
as
it
invested
him
with
the
glamor
of
far
lands
i
am
bêlit
she
cried
as
one
might
say
am
queen
at
me
conan
she
threw
wide
her
arms
am
bêlit
queen
of
the
black
coast
oh
tiger
of
the
north
you
are
cold
as
the
snowy
mountains
which
bred
you
take
me
and
crush
me
with
your
fierce
love
go
with
me
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
the
ends
of
the
sea
i
am
a
queen
by
fire
and
steel
and
slaughter
be
thou
my
king
his
eyes
swept
the
ranks
seeking
expressions
of
wrath
or
jealousy
he
saw
none
the
fury
was
gone
from
the
ebon
faces
he
realized
that
to
these
men
bêlit
was
more
than
a
woman
a
goddess
whose
will
was
unquestioned
he
glanced
at
the
wallowing
in
the
crimson
heeling
far
over
her
decks
awash
held
up
by
the
he
glanced
at
the
shore
at
the
far
green
hazes
of
the
ocean
at
the
vibrant
figure
which
stood
before
him
and
his
barbaric
soul
stirred
within
him
to
quest
these
shining
blue
realms
with
that
young
to
love
laugh
wander
and
pillage
sail
with
you
he
grunted
shaking
the
red
drops
from
his
blade
her
voice
twanged
like
a
bowstring
herbs
and
dress
your
master
wounds
the
rest
of
you
bring
aboard
the
plunder
and
cast
off
as
conan
sat
with
his
back
against
the
while
the
old
shaman
attended
to
the
cuts
on
his
hands
and
limbs
the
cargo
of
the
was
quickly
shifted
aboard
the
and
stored
in
small
cabins
below
deck
bodies
of
the
crew
and
of
fallen
pirates
were
cast
overboard
to
the
swarming
sharks
while
wounded
blacks
were
laid
in
the
waist
to
be
bandaged
then
the
were
cast
off
and
as
the
sank
silently
into
the
waters
the
moved
off
southward
to
the
rhythmic
clack
of
the
oars
as
they
moved
out
over
the
glassy
blue
deep
bêlit
came
to
the
poop
her
eyes
were
burning
like
those
of
a
in
the
dark
as
she
tore
off
her
ornaments
her
sandals
and
her
silken
girdle
and
cast
them
at
his
feet
rising
on
tiptoe
arms
stretched
upward
a
quivering
line
of
naked
white
she
cried
to
the
desperate
horde
of
the
blue
sea
behold
ye
now
the
dance
the
of
bêlit
whose
fathers
were
kings
of
askalon
and
she
danced
like
the
spin
of
a
desert
whirlwind
like
the
leaping
of
a
quenchless
flame
like
the
urge
of
creation
and
the
urge
of
death
her
white
feet
spurned
the
deck
and
dying
men
forgot
death
as
they
gazed
frozen
at
her
then
as
the
white
stars
glimmered
through
the
blue
velvet
dusk
making
her
whirling
body
a
blur
of
ivory
fire
with
a
wild
cry
she
threw
herself
at
conan
feet
and
the
blind
flood
of
the
cimmerian
desire
swept
all
else
away
as
he
crushed
her
panting
form
against
the
black
plates
of
his
corseleted
breast
the
black
lotus
that
dead
citadel
of
crumbling
stone
her
eyes
were
snared
by
that
unholy
sheen
and
curious
madness
took
me
by
the
throat
as
of
a
rival
lover
thrust
the
song
of
bêlit
the
ranged
the
sea
and
the
black
villages
shuddered
tomtoms
beat
in
the
night
with
a
tale
that
the
of
the
sea
had
found
a
mate
an
iron
man
whose
wrath
was
as
that
of
a
wounded
lion
and
survivors
of
butchered
stygian
ships
named
bêlit
with
curses
and
a
white
warrior
with
fierce
blue
eyes
so
the
stygian
princes
remembered
this
man
long
and
long
and
their
memory
was
a
bitter
tree
which
bore
crimson
fruit
in
the
years
to
come
but
heedless
as
a
vagrant
wind
the
cruised
the
southern
coasts
until
she
anchored
at
the
mouth
of
a
broad
sullen
river
whose
banks
were
walls
of
mystery
is
the
river
zarkheba
which
is
death
said
bêlit
waters
are
poisonous
see
how
dark
and
murky
they
run
only
venomous
reptiles
live
in
that
river
the
black
people
shun
it
once
a
stygian
galley
fleeing
from
me
fled
up
the
river
and
vanished
i
anchored
in
this
very
spot
and
days
later
the
galley
came
floating
down
the
dark
waters
its
decks
and
deserted
only
one
man
was
on
board
and
he
was
mad
and
died
gibbering
the
cargo
was
intact
but
the
crew
had
vanished
into
silence
and
mystery
lover
i
believe
there
is
a
city
somewhere
on
that
river
i
have
heard
tales
of
giant
towers
and
walls
glimpsed
afar
off
by
sailors
who
dared
go
up
the
river
we
fear
nothing
conan
let
us
go
and
sack
that
city
conan
agreed
he
generally
agreed
to
her
plans
hers
was
the
mind
that
directed
their
raids
his
the
arm
that
carried
out
her
ideas
it
mattered
little
to
him
where
they
sailed
or
whom
they
fought
so
long
as
they
sailed
and
fought
he
found
the
life
good
battle
and
raid
had
thinned
their
crew
only
some
eighty
spearmen
remained
scarcely
enough
to
work
the
long
galley
but
bêlit
would
not
take
the
time
to
make
the
long
cruise
southward
to
the
island
kingdoms
where
she
recruited
her
buccaneers
she
was
afire
with
eagerness
for
her
latest
venture
so
the
swung
into
the
river
mouth
the
oarsmen
pulling
strongly
as
she
breasted
the
broad
current
they
rounded
the
mysterious
bend
that
shut
out
the
sight
of
the
sea
and
sunset
found
them
forging
steadily
against
the
sluggish
flow
avoiding
sandbars
where
strange
reptiles
coiled
not
even
a
crocodile
did
they
see
nor
any
beast
or
winged
bird
coming
down
to
the
edge
to
drink
on
through
the
blackness
that
preceded
moonrise
they
drove
between
banks
that
were
solid
palisades
of
darkness
whence
came
mysterious
rustlings
and
stealthy
footfalls
and
the
gleam
of
grim
eyes
and
once
an
inhuman
voice
was
lifted
in
awful
mockery
the
cry
of
an
ape
bêlit
said
adding
that
the
souls
of
evil
men
were
imprisoned
in
these
animals
as
punishment
for
past
crimes
but
conan
doubted
for
once
in
a
cage
in
an
hyrkanian
city
he
had
seen
an
abysmal
beast
which
men
told
him
was
an
ape
and
there
had
been
about
it
naught
of
the
demoniac
malevolence
which
vibrated
in
the
shrieking
laughter
that
echoed
from
the
black
jungle
then
the
moon
rose
a
splash
of
blood
and
the
jungle
awoke
in
horrific
bedlam
to
greet
it
roars
and
howls
and
yells
set
the
black
warriors
to
trembling
but
all
this
noise
conan
noted
came
from
farther
back
in
the
jungle
as
if
the
beasts
no
less
than
men
shunned
the
black
waters
of
zarkheba
rising
above
the
black
denseness
of
the
trees
and
above
the
waving
fronds
the
moon
silvered
the
river
and
their
wake
became
a
rippling
scintillation
of
phosphorescent
bubbles
that
widened
like
a
shining
road
of
bursting
jewels
the
oars
dipped
into
the
shining
water
and
came
up
sheathed
in
frosty
silver
the
plumes
on
the
warrior
headpiece
nodded
in
the
wind
and
the
gems
on
and
harness
sparkled
frostily
the
cold
light
struck
icy
fire
from
the
jewels
in
bêlit
clustered
black
locks
as
she
stretched
her
lithe
figure
on
a
leopardskin
thrown
on
the
deck
supported
on
her
elbows
her
chin
resting
on
her
slim
hands
she
gazed
up
into
the
face
of
conan
who
lounged
beside
her
his
black
mane
stirring
in
the
faint
breeze
bêlit
eyes
were
dark
jewels
burning
in
the
moonlight
and
terror
are
about
us
conan
and
we
glide
into
the
realm
of
horror
and
death
she
said
you
afraid
a
shrug
of
his
mailed
shoulders
was
his
only
answer
am
not
afraid
either
she
said
meditatively
was
never
afraid
i
have
looked
into
the
naked
fangs
of
death
too
often
conan
do
you
fear
the
gods
would
not
tread
on
their
shadow
answered
the
barbarian
conservatively
gods
are
strong
to
harm
others
to
aid
at
least
so
say
their
priests
mitra
of
the
hyborians
must
be
a
strong
god
because
his
people
have
builded
their
cities
over
the
world
but
even
the
hyborians
fear
set
and
bel
god
of
thieves
is
a
good
god
when
i
was
a
thief
in
zamora
i
learned
of
him
of
your
own
gods
i
have
never
heard
you
call
on
them
chief
is
crom
he
dwells
on
a
great
mountain
what
use
to
call
on
him
little
he
cares
if
men
live
or
die
better
to
be
silent
than
to
call
his
attention
to
you
he
will
send
you
dooms
not
fortune
he
is
grim
and
loveless
but
at
birth
he
breathes
power
to
strive
and
slay
into
a
man
soul
what
else
shall
men
ask
of
the
gods
what
of
the
worlds
beyond
the
river
of
death
she
persisted
is
no
hope
here
or
hereafter
in
the
cult
of
my
people
answered
conan
this
world
men
struggle
and
suffer
vainly
finding
pleasure
only
in
the
bright
madness
of
battle
dying
their
souls
enter
a
gray
misty
realm
of
clouds
and
icy
winds
to
wander
cheerlessly
throughout
eternity
bêlit
shuddered
bad
as
it
is
is
better
than
such
a
destiny
what
do
you
believe
conan

shrugged
his
shoulders

known
many
gods
he
who
denies
them
is
as
blind
as
he
who
trusts
them
too
deeply

seek
not
beyond
death

blackness

live
deep
while

live
let
me
know
the
rich
juices
of
red
meat
and
stinging
wine
on
my
palate
the
hot
embrace
of
white
arms
the
mad
exultation
of
battle
when
the
blue
blades
flame
and
crimson
and
i
am
content
let
teachers

priests
and
philosophers
brood
over
questions
of
reality

illusion
i

is
illusion
then

am
no

an
illusion

being
thus
the
illusion
is

steal
the

this

conan
of
cimmeria
she
rose
lithely
to
her
knees
and
caught
him
in
a
pantherish
embrace
love
is
stronger
than
any
death
i
have
lain
in
your
arms
panting
with
the
violence
of
our
love
you

drawing
my

with

my

my

still
in

and
you

i
would
come
back
from

abyss
to
aid
you
aye
whether
my
spirit
floated
with
the
purple
sails
on
the
crystal
sea
of

or
writhed
in
the
molten
flames
of
hell
i
am
yours
and
all
the
gods
and
all
their
eternities
shall
not
sever
us
a
scream
rang
from
the
lookout
in
the
bows
thrusting
bêlit
aside
conan
bounded
up
his
sword
a
long
silver
glitter
in
the
moonlight
his
hair
bristling
at
what
he
saw
the
black
warrior
dangled
above
the
deck
supported
by
what
seemed
a
dark
pliant
tree
trunk
arching
over
the
rail
then
he
realized
that
it
was
a
gigantic
serpent
which
had
writhed
its
glistening
length
up
the
side
of
the
bow
and
gripped
the
luckless
warrior
in
its
jaws
its
dripping
scales
shone
leprously
in
the
moonlight
as
it
reared
its
form
high
above
the
deck
while
the
stricken
man
screamed
and
writhed
like
a
mouse
in
the
fangs
of
a
python
conan
rushed
into
the
bows
and
swinging
his
great
sword
hewed
nearly
through
the
giant
trunk
which
was
thicker
than
a
man
body
blood
drenched
the
rails
as
the
dying
monster
swayed
far
out
still
gripping
its
victim
and
sank
into
the
river
coil
by
coil
lashing
the
water
to
bloody
foam
in
which
man
and
reptile
vanished
together
thereafter
conan
kept
the
lookout
watch
himself
but
no
other
horror
came
crawling
up
from
the
murky
depths
and
as
dawn
whitened
over
the
jungle
he
sighted
the
black
fangs
of
towers
jutting
up
among
the
trees
he
called
bêlit
who
slept
on
the
deck
wrapped
in
his
scarlet
cloak
and
she
sprang
to
his
side
eyes
blazing
her
lips
were
parted
to
call
orders
to
her
warriors
to
take
up
bow
and
spears
then
her
lovely
eyes
widened
it
was
but
the
ghost
of
a
city
on
which
they
looked
when
they
cleared
a
jutting
point
and
swung
in
toward
the
shore
weeds
and
rank
river
grass
grew
between
the
stones
of
broken
piers
and
shattered
paves
that
had
once
been
streets
and
spacious
plazas
and
broad
courts
from
all
sides
except
that
toward
the
river
the
jungle
crept
in
masking
fallen
columns
and
crumbling
mounds
with
poisonous
green
here
and
there
buckling
towers
reeled
drunkenly
against
the
morning
sky
and
broken
pillars
jutted
up
among
the
decaying
walls
in
the
center
space
a
marble
pyramid
was
spired
by
a
slim
column
and
on
its
pinnacle
sat
or
squatted
something
that
conan
supposed
to
be
an
image
until
his
keen
eyes
detected
life
in
it
is
a
great
bird
said
one
of
the
warriors
standing
in
the
bows
is
a
monster
bat
insisted
another
is
an
ape
said
bêlit
just
then
the
creature
spread
broad
wings
and
flapped
off
into
the
jungle
winged
ape
said
old
uneasily
we
had
cut
our
throats
than
come
to
this
place
it
is
haunted
bêlit
mocked
at
his
superstitions
and
ordered
the
galley
run
inshore
and
tied
to
the
crumbling
wharfs
she
was
the
first
to
spring
ashore
closely
followed
by
conan
and
after
them
trooped
the
pirates
white
plumes
waving
in
the
morning
wind
spears
ready
eyes
rolling
dubiously
at
the
surrounding
jungle
over
all
brooded
a
silence
as
sinister
as
that
of
a
sleeping
serpent
bêlit
posed
picturesquely
among
the
ruins
the
vibrant
life
in
her
lithe
figure
contrasting
strangely
with
the
desolation
and
decay
about
her
the
sun
flamed
up
slowly
sullenly
above
the
jungle
flooding
the
towers
with
a
dull
gold
that
left
shadows
lurking
beneath
the
tottering
walls
bêlit
pointed
to
a
slim
round
tower
that
reeled
on
its
rotting
base
a
broad
expanse
of
cracked
slabs
led
up
to
it
flanked
by
fallen
columns
and
before
it
stood
a
massive
altar
bêlit
went
swiftly
along
the
ancient
floor
and
stood
before
it
was
the
temple
of
the
old
ones
she
said
you
can
see
the
channels
for
the
blood
along
the
sides
of
the
altar
and
the
rains
of
ten
thousand
years
have
not
washed
the
dark
stains
from
them
the
walls
have
all
fallen
away
but
this
stone
block
defies
time
and
the
elements
who
were
these
old
ones
demanded
conan
she
spread
her
slim
hands
helplessly
even
in
legendary
is
this
city
mentioned
but
look
at
the
handholes
at
either
end
of
the
altar
priests
often
conceal
their
treasures
beneath
their
altars
four
of
you
lay
hold
and
see
if
you
can
lift
it
she
stepped
back
to
make
room
for
them
glancing
up
at
the
tower
which
loomed
drunkenly
above
them
three
of
the
strongest
blacks
had
gripped
the
handholes
cut
into
the
stone
curiously
unsuited
to
human
hands
when
bêlit
sprang
back
with
a
sharp
cry
they
froze
in
their
places
and
conan
bending
to
aid
them
wheeled
with
a
startled
curse
snake
in
the
grass
she
said
backing
away
and
slay
it
the
rest
of
you
bend
your
backs
to
the
stone
conan
came
quickly
toward
her
another
taking
his
place
as
he
impatiently
scanned
the
grass
for
the
reptile
the
giant
blacks
braced
their
feet
grunted
and
heaved
with
their
huge
muscles
coiling
and
straining
under
their
ebon
skin
the
altar
did
not
come
off
the
ground
but
it
revolved
suddenly
on
its
side
and
simultaneously
there
was
a
grinding
rumble
above
and
the
tower
came
crashing
down
covering
the
four
black
men
with
broken
masonry
a
cry
of
horror
rose
from
their
comrades
bêlit
slim
fingers
dug
into
conan
was
no
serpent
she
whispered
was
but
a
ruse
to
call
you
away
i
feared
the
old
ones
guarded
their
treasure
well
let
us
clear
away
the
stones
with
herculean
labor
they
did
so
and
lifted
out
the
mangled
bodies
of
the
four
men
and
under
them
stained
with
their
blood
the
pirates
found
a
crypt
carved
in
the
solid
stone
the
altar
hinged
curiously
with
stone
rods
and
sockets
on
one
side
had
served
as
its
lid
and
at
first
glance
the
crypt
seemed
brimming
with
liquid
fire
catching
the
early
light
with
a
million
blazing
facets
undreamable
wealth
lay
before
the
eyes
of
the
gaping
pirates
diamonds
rubies
bloodstones
sapphires
turquoises
moonstones
opals
emeralds
amethysts
unknown
gems
that
shone
like
the
eyes
of
evil
women
the
crypt
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
bright
stones
that
the
morning
sun
struck
into
lambent
flame
with
a
cry
bêlit
dropped
to
her
knees
among
the
rubble
on
the
brink
and
thrust
her
white
arms
into
that
pool
of
splendor
she
withdrew
them
clutching
something
that
brought
another
cry
to
her
lips
a
long
string
of
crimson
stones
that
were
like
clots
of
frozen
blood
strung
on
a
thick
gold
wire
in
their
glow
the
golden
sunlight
changed
to
bloody
haze
bêlit
eyes
were
like
a
woman
in
a
trance
the
shemite
soul
finds
a
bright
drunkenness
in
riches
and
material
splendor
and
the
sight
of
this
treasure
might
have
shaken
the
soul
of
a
sated
emperor
of
shushan
up
the
jewels
dogs
her
voice
was
shrill
with
her
emotions
a
muscular
black
arm
stabbed
toward
the
and
bêlit
wheeled
her
crimson
lips
as
if
she
expected
to
see
a
rival
corsair
sweeping
in
to
despoil
her
of
her
plunder
but
from
the
gunwales
of
the
ship
a
dark
shape
rose
soaring
away
over
the
jungle
has
been
investigating
the
ship
muttered
the
blacks
uneasily
matter
cried
bêlit
with
a
curse
raking
back
a
rebellious
lock
with
an
impatient
hand
a
litter
of
spears
and
mantles
to
bear
these
jewels
where
the
devil
are
you
going
look
to
the
galley
grunted
conan
might
have
knocked
a
hole
in
the
bottom
for
all
we
know
he
ran
swiftly
down
the
cracked
wharf
and
sprang
aboard
a
swift
examination
below
decks
and
he
swore
heartily
casting
a
clouded
glance
in
the
direction
the
had
vanished
he
returned
hastily
to
bêlit
superintending
the
plundering
of
the
crypt
she
had
looped
the
necklace
about
her
neck
and
on
her
naked
white
bosom
the
red
clots
glimmered
darkly
a
huge
naked
black
stood
in
the
crypt
scooping
up
great
handfuls
of
splendor
to
pass
them
to
eager
hands
above
strings
of
frozen
iridescence
hung
between
his
dusky
fingers
drops
of
red
fire
dripped
from
his
hands
piled
high
with
starlight
and
rainbow
it
was
as
if
a
black
titan
stood
in
the
bright
pits
of
hell
his
lifted
hands
full
of
stars
flying
devil
has
staved
in
the
said
conan
we
had
been
so
dazed
by
these
stones
we
have
heard
the
noise
we
were
fools
not
to
have
left
a
man
on
guard
we
ca
drink
this
river
water
i
take
twenty
men
and
search
for
fresh
water
in
the
jungle
she
looked
at
him
vaguely
in
her
eyes
the
blank
blaze
of
her
strange
passion
her
fingers
working
at
the
gems
on
her
breast
well
she
said
absently
hardly
heeding
him
get
the
loot
aboard
the
jungle
closed
quickly
about
them
changing
the
light
from
gold
to
gray
from
the
arching
green
branches
creepers
dangled
like
pythons
the
warriors
fell
into
single
file
creeping
through
the
primordial
twilights
like
black
phantoms
following
a
white
ghost
underbrush
was
not
so
thick
as
conan
had
anticipated
the
ground
was
spongy
but
not
slushy
away
from
the
river
it
sloped
gradually
upward
deeper
and
deeper
they
plunged
into
the
green
waving
depths
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
water
either
running
stream
or
stagnant
pool
conan
halted
suddenly
his
warriors
freezing
into
basaltic
statues
in
the
tense
silence
that
followed
the
cimmerian
shook
his
head
irritably
ahead
he
grunted
to
a
straight
on
until
you
can
no
longer
see
me
then
stop
and
wait
for
me
i
believe
being
followed
i
heard
something
the
blacks
shuffled
their
feet
uneasily
but
did
as
they
were
told
as
they
swung
onward
conan
stepped
quickly
behind
a
great
tree
glaring
back
along
the
way
they
had
come
from
that
leafy
fastness
anything
might
emerge
nothing
occurred
the
faint
sounds
of
the
marching
spearmen
faded
in
the
distance
conan
suddenly
realized
that
the
air
was
impregnated
with
an
alien
and
exotic
scent
something
gently
brushed
his
temple
he
turned
quickly
from
a
cluster
of
green
curiously
leafed
stalks
great
black
blossoms
nodded
at
him
one
of
these
had
touched
him
they
seemed
to
beckon
him
to
arch
their
pliant
stems
toward
him
they
spread
and
rustled
though
no
wind
blew
he
recoiled
recognizing
the
black
lotus
whose
juice
was
death
and
whose
scent
brought
slumber
but
already
he
felt
a
subtle
lethargy
stealing
over
him
he
sought
to
lift
his
sword
to
hew
down
the
serpentine
stalks
but
his
arm
hung
lifeless
at
his
side
he
opened
his
mouth
to
shout
to
his
warriors
but
only
a
faint
rattle
issued
the
next
instant
with
appalling
suddenness
the
jungle
waved
and
dimmed
out
before
his
eyes
he
did
not
hear
the
screams
that
burst
out
awfully
not
far
away
as
his
knees
collapsed
letting
him
pitch
limply
to
the
earth
above
his
prostrate
form
the
great
black
blossoms
nodded
in
the
windless
air
the
horror
in
the
jungle
it
a
dream
the
nighted
lotus
brought
then
curst
the
dream
that
bought
my
sluggish
life
and
curst
each
laggard
hour
that
does
not
see
hot
blood
drip
blackly
from
the
crimsoned
the
song
of
bêlit
first
there
was
the
blackness
of
an
utter
void
with
the
cold
winds
of
cosmic
space
blowing
through
it
then
shapes
vague
monstrous
and
evanescent
rolled
in
dim
panorama
through
the
expanse
of
nothingness
as
if
the
darkness
were
taking
material
form
the
winds
blew
and
a
vortex
formed
a
whirling
pyramid
of
roaring
blackness
from
it
grew
shape
and
dimension
then
suddenly
like
clouds
dispersing
the
darkness
rolled
away
on
either
hand
and
a
huge
city
of
dark
green
stone
rose
on
the
bank
of
a
wide
river
flowing
through
an
illimitable
plain
through
this
city
moved
beings
of
alien
configuration
cast
in
the
mold
of
humanity
they
were
distinctly
not
men
they
were
winged
and
of
heroic
proportions
not
a
branch
on
the
mysterious
stalk
of
evolution
that
culminated
in
man
but
the
ripe
blossom
on
an
alien
tree
separate
and
apart
from
that
stalk
aside
from
their
wings
in
physical
appearance
they
resembled
man
only
as
man
in
his
highest
form
resembles
the
great
apes
in
spiritual
esthetic
and
intellectual
development
they
were
superior
to
man
as
man
is
superior
to
the
gorilla
but
when
they
reared
their
colossal
city
man
primal
ancestors
had
not
yet
risen
from
the
slime
of
the
primordial
seas
these
beings
were
mortal
as
are
all
things
built
of
flesh
and
blood
they
lived
loved
and
died
though
the
individual
span
of
life
was
enormous
then
after
uncounted
millions
of
years
the
change
began
the
vista
shimmered
and
wavered
like
a
picture
thrown
on
a
windblown
curtain
over
the
city
and
the
land
the
ages
flowed
as
waves
flow
over
a
beach
and
each
wave
brought
alterations
somewhere
on
the
planet
the
magnetic
centers
were
shifting
the
great
glaciers
and
were
withdrawing
toward
the
new
poles
the
littoral
of
the
great
river
altered
plains
turned
into
swamps
that
stank
with
reptilian
life
where
fertile
meadows
had
rolled
forests
reared
up
growing
into
dank
jungles
the
changing
ages
wrought
on
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
as
well
they
did
not
migrate
to
fresher
lands
reasons
inexplicable
to
humanity
held
them
to
the
ancient
city
and
their
doom
and
as
that
once
rich
and
mighty
land
sank
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
black
mire
of
the
sunless
jungle
so
into
the
chaos
of
squalling
jungle
life
sank
the
people
of
the
city
terrific
convulsions
shook
the
earth
the
nights
were
lurid
with
spouting
volcanoes
that
fringed
the
dark
horizons
with
red
pillars
after
an
earthquake
that
shook
down
the
outer
walls
and
highest
towers
of
the
city
and
caused
the
river
to
run
black
for
days
with
some
lethal
substance
spewed
up
from
the
subterranean
depths
a
frightful
chemical
change
became
apparent
in
the
waters
the
folk
had
drunk
for
millenniums
uncountable
many
died
who
drank
of
it
and
in
those
who
lived
the
drinking
wrought
change
subtle
gradual
and
grisly
in
adapting
themselves
to
the
changing
conditions
they
had
sunk
far
below
their
original
level
but
the
lethal
waters
altered
them
even
more
horribly
from
generation
to
more
bestial
generation
they
who
had
been
winged
gods
became
pinioned
demons
with
all
that
remained
of
their
ancestors
vast
knowledge
distorted
and
perverted
and
twisted
into
ghastly
paths
as
they
had
risen
higher
than
mankind
might
dream
so
they
sank
lower
than
maddest
nightmares
reach
they
died
fast
by
cannibalism
and
horrible
feuds
fought
out
in
the
murk
of
the
midnight
jungle
and
at
last
among
the
ruins
of
their
city
only
a
single
shape
lurked
a
stunted
abhorrent
perversion
of
nature
then
for
the
first
time
humans
appeared
men
in
copper
and
leather
harness
bearing
bows
the
warriors
of
stygia
there
were
only
fifty
of
them
and
they
were
haggard
and
gaunt
with
starvation
and
prolonged
effort
stained
and
scratched
with
with
bandages
that
told
of
fierce
fighting
in
their
minds
was
a
tale
of
warfare
and
defeat
and
flight
before
a
stronger
tribe
which
drove
them
ever
southward
until
they
lost
themselves
in
the
green
ocean
of
jungle
and
river
exhausted
they
lay
down
among
the
ruins
where
red
blossoms
that
bloom
but
once
in
a
century
waved
in
the
full
moon
and
sleep
fell
upon
them
and
as
they
slept
a
hideous
shape
crept
from
the
shadows
and
performed
weird
and
awful
rites
about
and
above
each
sleeper
the
moon
hung
in
the
shadowy
sky
painting
the
jungle
red
and
black
above
the
sleepers
glimmered
the
crimson
blossoms
like
splashes
of
blood
then
the
moon
went
down
and
the
eyes
of
the
necromancer
were
red
jewels
set
in
the
ebony
of
night
when
dawn
spread
its
white
veil
over
the
river
there
were
no
men
to
be
seen
only
a
hairy
winged
horror
that
squatted
in
the
center
of
a
ring
of
fifty
great
spotted
hyenas
that
pointed
quivering
muzzles
to
the
ghastly
sky
and
howled
like
souls
in
hell
then
scene
followed
scene
so
swiftly
that
each
tripped
over
the
heels
of
its
predecessor
there
was
a
confusion
of
movement
a
writhing
and
melting
of
lights
and
shadows
against
a
background
of
black
jungle
green
stone
ruins
and
murky
river
black
men
came
up
the
river
in
long
boats
with
skulls
grinning
on
the
prows
or
stole
stooping
through
the
trees
spear
in
hand
they
fled
screaming
through
the
dark
from
red
eyes
and
slavering
fangs
howls
of
dying
men
shook
the
shadows
stealthy
feet
padded
through
the
gloom
vampire
eyes
blazed
redly
there
were
grisly
feasts
beneath
the
moon
across
whose
red
disk
a
shadow
incessantly
swept
then
abruptly
etched
clearly
in
contrast
to
these
impressionistic
glimpses
around
the
jungled
point
in
the
whitening
dawn
swept
a
long
galley
thronged
with
shining
ebon
figures
and
in
the
bows
stood
a
ghost
in
blue
steel
it
was
at
this
point
that
conan
first
realized
that
he
was
dreaming
until
that
instant
he
had
had
no
consciousness
of
individual
existence
but
as
he
saw
himself
treading
the
boards
of
the
he
recognized
both
the
existence
and
the
dream
although
he
did
not
awaken
even
as
he
wondered
the
scene
shifted
abruptly
to
a
jungle
glade
where
and
nineteen
black
spearmen
stood
as
if
awaiting
someone
even
as
he
realized
that
it
was
he
for
whom
they
waited
a
horror
swooped
down
from
the
skies
and
their
stolidity
was
broken
by
yells
of
fear
like
men
maddened
by
terror
they
threw
away
their
weapons
and
raced
wildly
through
the
jungle
pressed
close
by
the
slavering
monstrosity
that
flapped
its
wings
above
them
chaos
and
confusion
followed
this
vision
during
which
conan
feebly
struggled
to
awake
dimly
he
seemed
to
see
himself
lying
under
a
nodding
cluster
of
black
blossoms
while
from
the
bushes
a
hideous
shape
crept
toward
him
with
a
savage
effort
he
broke
the
unseen
bonds
which
held
him
to
his
dreams
and
started
upright
bewilderment
was
in
the
glare
he
cast
about
him
near
him
swayed
the
dusky
lotus
and
he
hastened
to
draw
away
from
it
in
the
spongy
soil
near
by
there
was
a
track
as
if
an
animal
had
put
out
a
foot
preparatory
to
emerging
from
the
bushes
then
had
withdrawn
it
it
looked
like
the
spoor
of
an
unbelievably
large
hyena
he
yelled
for
primordial
silence
brooded
over
the
jungle
in
which
his
yells
sounded
brittle
and
hollow
as
mockery
he
could
not
see
the
sun
but
his
instinct
told
him
the
day
was
near
its
end
a
panic
rose
in
him
at
the
thought
that
he
had
lain
senseless
for
hours
he
hastily
followed
the
tracks
of
the
spearmen
which
lay
plain
in
the
damp
loam
before
him
they
ran
in
single
file
and
he
soon
emerged
into
a
glade
to
stop
short
the
skin
crawling
between
his
shoulders
as
he
recognized
it
as
the
glade
he
had
seen
in
his
dream
shields
and
spears
lay
scattered
about
as
if
dropped
in
headlong
flight
and
from
the
tracks
which
led
out
of
the
glade
and
deeper
into
the
fastnesses
conan
knew
that
the
spearmen
had
fled
wildly
the
footprints
overlay
one
another
they
weaved
blindly
among
the
trees
and
with
startling
suddenness
the
hastening
cimmerian
came
out
of
the
jungle
onto
a
rock
which
sloped
steeply
to
break
off
abruptly
in
a
sheer
precipice
forty
feet
high
and
something
crouched
on
the
brink
at
first
conan
thought
it
to
be
a
great
black
gorilla
then
he
saw
that
it
was
a
giant
black
man
that
crouched
long
arms
dangling
froth
dripping
from
the
loose
lips
it
was
not
until
with
a
sobbing
cry
the
creature
lifted
huge
hands
and
rushed
towards
him
that
conan
recognized
the
black
man
gave
no
heed
to
conan
shout
as
he
charged
eyes
rolled
up
to
display
the
whites
teeth
gleaming
face
an
inhuman
mask
with
his
skin
crawling
with
the
horror
that
madness
always
instils
in
the
sane
conan
passed
his
sword
through
the
black
man
body
then
avoiding
the
hooked
hands
that
clawed
at
him
as
sank
down
he
strode
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
for
an
instant
he
stood
looking
down
into
the
jagged
rocks
below
where
lay
spearmen
in
limp
distorted
attitudes
that
told
of
crushed
limbs
and
splintered
bones
not
one
moved
a
cloud
of
huge
black
flies
buzzed
loudly
above
the
stones
the
ants
had
already
begun
to
gnaw
at
the
corpses
on
the
trees
about
sat
birds
of
prey
and
a
jackal
looking
up
and
seeing
the
man
on
the
cliff
slunk
furtively
away
for
a
little
space
conan
stood
motionless
then
he
wheeled
and
ran
back
the
way
he
had
come
flinging
himself
with
reckless
haste
through
the
tall
grass
and
bushes
hurdling
creepers
that
sprawled
across
his
path
his
sword
swung
low
in
his
right
hand
and
an
unaccustomed
pallor
tinged
his
dark
face
the
silence
that
reigned
in
the
jungle
was
not
broken
the
sun
had
set
and
great
shadows
rushed
upward
from
the
slime
of
the
black
earth
through
the
gigantic
shades
of
lurking
death
and
grim
desolation
conan
was
a
speeding
glimmer
of
scarlet
and
blue
steel
no
sound
in
all
the
solitude
was
heard
except
his
own
quick
panting
as
he
burst
from
the
shadows
into
the
dim
twilight
of
the
he
saw
the
galley
shouldering
the
rotten
wharf
the
ruins
reeling
drunkenly
in
the
gray
and
here
and
there
among
the
stones
were
spots
of
raw
bright
color
as
if
a
careless
hand
had
splashed
with
a
crimson
brush
again
conan
looked
on
death
and
destruction
before
him
lay
his
spearmen
nor
did
they
rise
to
salute
him
from
the
to
the
riverbank
among
the
rotting
pillars
and
along
the
broken
piers
they
lay
torn
and
mangled
and
half
devoured
chewed
travesties
of
men
all
about
the
bodies
and
pieces
of
bodies
were
swarms
of
huge
footprints
like
those
of
hyenas
conan
came
silently
upon
the
pier
approaching
the
galley
above
whose
deck
was
suspended
something
that
glimmered
in
the
faint
twilight
speechless
the
cimmerian
looked
on
the
queen
of
the
black
coast
as
she
hung
from
the
of
her
own
galley
between
the
yard
and
her
white
throat
stretched
a
line
of
crimson
clots
that
shone
like
blood
in
the
gray
light
the
attack
from
the
air
shadows
were
black
around
him
the
dripping
jaws
gaped
wide
thicker
than
rain
the
red
drops
fell
but
my
love
was
fiercer
than
death
black
spell
nor
all
the
iron
walls
of
hell
could
keep
me
from
his
the
song
of
bêlit
the
jungle
was
a
black
colossus
that
locked
the
glade
in
ebon
arms
the
moon
had
not
risen
the
stars
were
flecks
of
hot
amber
in
a
breathless
sky
that
reeked
of
death
on
the
pyramid
among
the
fallen
towers
sat
conan
the
cimmerian
like
an
iron
statue
chin
propped
on
massive
fists
out
in
the
black
shadows
stealthy
feet
padded
and
red
eyes
glimmered
the
dead
lay
as
they
had
fallen
but
on
the
deck
of
the
on
a
pyre
of
broken
benches
and
leopardskins
lay
the
queen
of
the
black
coast
in
her
last
sleep
wrapped
in
scarlet
cloak
like
a
true
queen
she
lay
with
her
plunder
heaped
high
about
her
silks
silver
braid
casks
of
gems
and
golden
coins
silver
ingots
jeweled
daggers
and
teocallis
of
gold
wedges
but
of
the
plunder
of
the
accursed
city
only
the
sullen
waters
of
zarkheba
could
tell
where
conan
had
thrown
it
with
a
heathen
curse
now
he
sat
grimly
on
the
pyramid
waiting
for
his
unseen
foes
the
black
fury
in
his
soul
drove
out
all
fear
what
shapes
would
emerge
from
the
blackness
he
knew
not
nor
did
he
care
he
no
longer
doubted
the
visions
of
the
black
lotus
he
understood
that
while
waiting
for
him
in
the
glade
and
his
comrades
had
been
by
the
winged
monster
swooping
upon
them
from
the
sky
and
fleeing
in
blind
panic
had
fallen
over
the
cliff
all
except
their
chief
who
had
somehow
escaped
their
fate
though
not
madness
meanwhile
or
immediately
after
or
perhaps
before
the
destruction
of
those
on
the
riverbank
had
been
accomplished
conan
did
not
doubt
that
the
slaughter
along
the
river
had
been
massacre
rather
than
battle
already
unmanned
by
their
superstitious
fears
the
blacks
might
well
have
died
without
striking
a
blow
in
their
own
defense
when
attacked
by
their
inhuman
foes
why
he
had
been
spared
so
long
he
did
not
understand
unless
the
malign
entity
which
ruled
the
river
meant
to
keep
him
alive
to
torture
him
with
grief
and
fear
all
pointed
to
a
human
or
superhuman
intelligence
the
breaking
of
the
to
divide
the
forces
the
driving
of
the
blacks
over
the
cliff
and
last
and
greatest
the
grim
jest
of
the
crimson
necklace
knotted
like
a
hangman
noose
about
bêlit
white
neck
having
apparently
saved
the
cimmerian
for
the
choicest
victim
and
extracted
the
last
ounce
of
exquisite
mental
torture
it
was
likely
that
the
unknown
enemy
would
conclude
the
drama
by
sending
him
after
the
other
victims
no
smile
bent
conan
grim
lips
at
the
thought
but
his
eyes
were
lit
with
iron
laughter
the
moon
rose
striking
fire
from
the
cimmerian
horned
helmet
no
call
awoke
the
echoes
yet
suddenly
the
night
grew
tense
and
the
jungle
held
its
breath
instinctively
conan
loosened
the
great
sword
in
its
sheath
the
pyramid
on
which
he
rested
was
one
the
side
toward
the
jungle
carved
in
broad
steps
in
his
hand
was
a
shemite
bow
such
as
bêlit
had
taught
her
pirates
to
use
a
heap
of
arrows
lay
at
his
feet
feathered
ends
towards
him
as
he
rested
on
one
knee
something
moved
in
the
blackness
under
the
trees
etched
abruptly
in
the
rising
moon
conan
saw
a
darkly
head
and
shoulders
brutish
in
outline
and
now
from
the
shadows
dark
shapes
came
silently
swiftly
running
low
twenty
great
spotted
hyenas
their
slavering
fangs
flashed
in
the
moonlight
their
eyes
blazed
as
no
true
beast
eyes
ever
blazed
twenty
then
the
spears
of
the
pirates
had
taken
toll
of
the
pack
after
all
even
as
he
thought
this
conan
drew
nock
to
ear
and
at
the
twang
of
the
string
a
shadow
bounded
high
and
fell
writhing
the
rest
did
not
falter
on
they
came
and
like
a
rain
of
death
among
them
fell
the
arrows
of
the
cimmerian
driven
with
all
the
force
and
accuracy
of
steely
thews
backed
by
a
hate
hot
as
the
of
hell
in
his
berserk
fury
he
did
not
miss
the
air
was
filled
with
feathered
destruction
the
havoc
wrought
among
the
onrushing
pack
was
breathtaking
less
than
half
of
them
reached
the
foot
of
the
pyramid
others
dropped
upon
the
broad
steps
glaring
down
into
the
blazing
eyes
conan
knew
these
creatures
were
not
beasts
it
was
not
merely
in
their
unnatural
size
that
he
sensed
a
blasphemous
difference
they
exuded
an
aura
tangible
as
the
black
mist
rising
from
a
swamp
by
what
godless
alchemy
these
beings
had
been
brought
into
existence
he
could
not
guess
but
he
knew
he
faced
diabolism
blacker
than
the
well
of
skelos
springing
to
his
feet
he
bent
his
bow
powerfully
and
drove
his
last
shaft
point
blank
at
a
great
hairy
shape
that
soared
up
at
his
throat
the
arrow
was
a
flying
beam
of
moonlight
that
flashed
onward
with
but
a
blur
in
its
course
but
the
plunged
convulsively
in
midair
and
crashed
headlong
shot
through
and
through
then
the
rest
were
on
him
in
a
nightmare
rush
of
blazing
eyes
and
dripping
fangs
his
fiercely
driven
sword
shore
the
first
asunder
then
the
desperate
impact
of
the
others
bore
him
down
he
crushed
a
narrow
skull
with
the
pommel
of
his
hilt
feeling
the
bone
splinter
and
blood
and
brains
gush
over
his
hand
then
dropping
the
sword
useless
at
such
deadly
close
quarters
he
caught
at
the
throats
of
the
two
horrors
which
were
ripping
and
tearing
at
him
in
silent
fury
a
foul
acrid
scent
almost
stifled
him
his
own
sweat
blinded
him
only
his
mail
saved
him
from
being
ripped
to
ribbons
in
an
instant
the
next
his
naked
right
hand
locked
on
a
hairy
throat
and
tore
it
open
his
left
hand
missing
the
throat
of
the
other
beast
caught
and
broke
its
foreleg
a
short
yelp
the
only
cry
in
that
grim
battle
and
hideously
burst
from
the
maimed
beast
at
the
sick
horror
of
that
cry
from
a
bestial
throat
conan
involuntarily
relaxed
his
grip
one
blood
gushing
from
its
torn
jugular
lunged
at
him
in
a
last
spasm
of
ferocity
and
fastened
its
fangs
on
his
throat
to
fall
back
dead
even
as
conan
felt
the
tearing
agony
of
its
grip
the
other
springing
forward
on
three
legs
was
slashing
at
his
belly
as
a
wolf
slashes
actually
rending
the
links
of
his
mail
flinging
aside
the
dying
beast
conan
grappled
the
crippled
horror
and
with
a
muscular
effort
that
brought
a
groan
from
his
lips
he
heaved
upright
gripping
the
struggling
tearing
fiend
in
his
arms
an
instant
he
reeled
off
balance
its
fetid
breath
hot
on
his
nostrils
its
jaws
snapping
at
his
neck
then
he
hurled
it
from
him
to
crash
with
force
down
the
marble
steps
as
he
reeled
on
legs
sobbing
for
breath
the
jungle
and
the
moon
swimming
bloodily
to
his
sight
the
thrash
of
was
loud
in
his
ears
stooping
he
groped
for
his
sword
and
swaying
upright
braced
his
feet
drunkenly
and
heaved
the
great
blade
above
his
head
with
both
hands
shaking
the
blood
from
his
eyes
as
he
sought
the
air
above
him
for
his
foe
instead
of
attack
from
the
air
the
pyramid
staggered
suddenly
and
awfully
beneath
his
feet
he
heard
a
rumbling
crackle
and
saw
the
tall
column
above
him
wave
like
a
wand
stung
to
galvanized
life
he
bounded
far
out
his
feet
hit
a
step
halfway
down
which
rocked
beneath
him
and
his
next
desperate
leap
carried
him
clear
but
even
as
his
heels
hit
the
earth
with
a
shattering
crash
like
a
breaking
mountain
the
pyramid
crumpled
the
column
came
thundering
down
in
bursting
fragments
for
a
blind
cataclysmic
instant
the
sky
seemed
to
rain
shards
of
marble
then
a
rubble
of
shattered
stone
lay
whitely
under
the
moon
conan
stirred
throwing
off
the
splinters
that
half
covered
him
a
glancing
blow
had
knocked
off
his
helmet
and
momentarily
stunned
him
across
his
legs
lay
a
great
piece
of
the
column
pinning
him
down
he
was
not
sure
that
his
legs
were
unbroken
his
black
locks
were
plastered
with
sweat
blood
trickled
from
the
wounds
in
his
throat
and
hands
he
hitched
up
on
one
arm
struggling
with
the
debris
that
prisoned
him
then
something
swept
down
across
the
stars
and
struck
the
sward
near
him
twisting
about
he
saw
it
winged
one
with
fearful
speed
it
was
rushing
upon
him
and
in
that
instant
conan
had
only
a
confused
impression
of
a
gigantic
shape
hurtling
along
on
bowed
and
stunted
legs
of
huge
hairy
arms
outstretching
misshapen
paws
of
a
malformed
head
in
whose
broad
face
the
only
features
recognizable
as
such
were
a
pair
of
eyes
it
was
a
thing
neither
man
beast
nor
devil
imbued
with
characteristics
subhuman
as
well
as
characteristics
superhuman
but
conan
had
no
time
for
conscious
consecutive
thought
he
threw
himself
toward
his
fallen
sword
and
his
clawing
fingers
missed
it
by
inches
desperately
he
grasped
the
shard
which
pinned
his
legs
and
the
veins
swelled
in
his
temples
as
he
strove
to
thrust
it
off
him
it
gave
slowly
but
he
knew
that
before
he
could
free
himself
the
monster
would
be
upon
him
and
he
knew
that
those
hands
were
death
the
headlong
rush
of
the
winged
one
had
not
wavered
it
towered
over
the
prostrate
cimmerian
like
a
black
shadow
arms
thrown
wide
a
glimmer
of
white
flashed
between
it
and
its
victim
in
one
mad
instant
she
was
there
a
tense
white
shape
vibrant
with
love
fierce
as
a
the
dazed
cimmerian
saw
between
him
and
the
onrushing
death
her
lithe
figure
shimmering
like
ivory
beneath
the
moon
he
saw
the
blaze
of
her
dark
eyes
the
thick
cluster
of
her
burnished
hair
her
bosom
heaved
her
red
lips
were
parted
she
cried
out
sharp
and
ringing
at
the
ring
of
steel
as
she
thrust
at
the
winged
monster
breast
screamed
conan
she
flashed
a
quick
glance
at
him
and
in
her
dark
eyes
he
saw
her
love
flaming
a
naked
elemental
thing
of
raw
fire
and
molten
lava
then
she
was
gone
and
the
cimmerian
saw
only
the
winged
fiend
which
had
staggered
back
in
unwonted
fear
arms
lifted
as
if
to
fend
off
attack
and
he
knew
that
bêlit
in
truth
lay
on
her
pyre
on
the
deck
in
his
ears
rang
her
passionate
cry
i
still
in
death
and
you
fighting
for
life
i
would
come
back
from
the
abyss
with
a
terrible
cry
he
heaved
upward
hurling
the
stone
aside
the
winged
one
came
on
again
and
conan
sprang
to
meet
it
his
veins
on
fire
with
madness
the
thews
started
out
like
cords
on
his
forearms
as
he
swung
his
great
sword
pivoting
on
his
heel
with
the
force
of
the
sweeping
arc
just
above
the
hips
it
caught
the
hurtling
shape
and
the
knotted
legs
fell
one
way
the
torso
another
as
the
blade
sheared
clear
through
its
hairy
body
conan
stood
in
the
moonlit
silence
the
dripping
sword
sagging
in
his
hand
staring
down
at
the
remnants
of
his
enemy
the
red
eyes
glared
up
at
him
with
awful
life
then
glazed
and
set
the
great
hands
knotted
spasmodically
and
stiffened
and
the
oldest
race
in
the
world
was
extinct
conan
lifted
his
head
mechanically
searching
for
the
that
had
been
its
slaves
and
executioners
none
met
his
gaze
the
bodies
he
saw
littering
the
grass
were
of
men
not
beasts
men
naked
transfixed
by
arrows
or
mangled
by
and
they
were
crumbling
into
dust
before
his
eyes
why
had
not
the
winged
master
come
to
the
aid
of
its
slaves
when
he
struggled
with
them
had
it
feared
to
come
within
reach
of
fangs
that
might
turn
and
rend
it
craft
and
caution
had
lurked
in
that
misshapen
skull
but
had
not
availed
in
the
end
turning
on
his
heel
the
cimmerian
strode
down
the
rotting
wharfs
and
stepped
aboard
the
galley
a
few
strokes
of
his
sword
cut
her
adrift
and
he
went
to
the
the
rocked
slowly
in
the
sullen
water
sliding
out
sluggishly
toward
the
middle
of
the
river
until
the
broad
current
caught
her
conan
leaned
on
the
sweep
his
somber
gaze
fixed
on
the
shape
that
lay
in
state
on
the
pyre
the
richness
of
which
was
equal
to
the
ransom
of
an
empress
the
funeral
pyre
we
are
done
with
roaming
evermore
no
more
the
oars
the
windy
harp
refrain
nor
crimson
pennon
frights
the
dusky
shore
blue
girdle
of
the
world
receive
again
her
whom
thou
gavest
the
song
of
bêlit
again
dawn
tinged
the
ocean
a
redder
glow
lit
the
conan
of
cimmeria
leaned
on
his
great
sword
upon
the
white
beach
watching
the
swinging
out
on
her
last
voyage
there
was
no
light
in
his
eyes
that
contemplated
the
glassy
swells
out
of
the
rolling
blue
wastes
all
glory
and
wonder
had
gone
a
fierce
revulsion
shook
him
as
he
gazed
at
the
green
surges
that
deepened
into
purple
hazes
of
mystery
bêlit
had
been
of
the
sea
she
had
lent
it
splendor
and
allure
without
her
it
rolled
a
barren
dreary
and
desolate
waste
from
pole
to
pole
she
belonged
to
the
sea
to
its
everlasting
mystery
he
returned
her
he
could
do
no
more
for
himself
its
glittering
blue
splendor
was
more
repellent
than
the
leafy
fronds
which
rustled
and
whispered
behind
him
of
vast
mysterious
wilds
beyond
them
and
into
which
he
must
plunge
no
hand
was
at
the
sweep
of
the
no
oars
drove
her
through
the
green
water
but
a
clean
tanging
wind
bellied
her
silken
sail
and
as
a
wild
swan
cleaves
the
sky
to
her
nest
she
sped
seaward
flames
mounting
higher
and
higher
from
her
deck
to
lick
at
the
mast
and
envelop
the
figure
that
lay
lapped
in
scarlet
on
the
shining
pyre
so
passed
the
queen
of
the
black
coast
and
leaning
on
his
sword
conan
stood
silently
until
the
red
glow
had
faded
far
out
in
the
blue
hazes
and
dawn
splashed
its
rose
and
gold
over
the
ocean
