the

with

the
surprising
narration
of
robert
holt
chapter
i
outside
room
full
up
he
banged
the
door
in
my
face
that
was
the
final
blow
to
have
tramped
about
all
day
looking
for
work
to
have
begged
even
for
a
job
which
would
give
me
money
enough
to
buy
a
little
food
and
to
have
tramped
and
to
have
begged
in
vain
that
was
bad
but
sick
at
heart
depressed
in
mind
and
in
body
exhausted
by
hunger
and
fatigue
to
have
been
compelled
to
pocket
any
little
pride
i
might
have
left
and
solicit
as
the
penniless
homeless
tramp
which
indeed
i
was
a
night
lodging
in
the
casual
ward
and
to
solicit
it
in
vain
that
was
worse
much
worse
about
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
i
stared
stupidly
at
the
door
which
had
just
been
banged
in
my
face
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
thing
was
possible
i
had
hardly
expected
to
figure
as
a
tramp
but
supposing
it
conceivable
that
i
could
become
a
tramp
that
i
should
be
refused
admission
to
that
abode
of
all
ignominy
the
tramp
ward
was
to
have
attained
a
depth
of
misery
of
which
never
even
in
nightmares
i
had
dreamed
as
i
stood
wondering
what
i
should
do
a
man
slouched
towards
me
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
wall
let
yer
in
says
it
full
it
full
does
that
the
lay
at
fulham
they
always
says
it
full
they
wants
to
keep
the
number
down
i
looked
at
the
man
askance
his
head
hung
forward
his
hands
were
in
his
trouser
pockets
his
clothes
were
rags
his
tone
was
husky
you
mean
that
they
say
it
full
when
it
is
that
they
let
me
in
although
there
room
it
bloke
yer
if
there
room
are
they
bound
to
let
me
in
they
are
and
blimey
if
i
was
you
i
make
blimey
i
would
he
broke
into
a
volley
of
execrations
what
am
i
to
do
give
another
rouser
let
know
as
you
wo
be
kidded
i
hesitated
then
acting
on
his
suggestion
for
the
second
time
i
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
flung
wide
open
and
the
grizzled
pauper
who
had
previously
responded
to
my
summons
stood
in
the
open
doorway
had
he
been
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
guardians
himself
he
could
not
have
addressed
me
with
greater
scorn
here
again
what
your
little
game
think
i
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
wait
upon
the
likes
of
you
want
to
be
admitted
you
wo
be
admitted
want
to
see
someone
in
authority
yer
seein
someone
in
authority
want
to
see
someone
besides
you
i
want
to
see
the
master
you
wo
see
the
master
he
moved
the
door
swiftly
to
but
prepared
for
such
a
manoeuvre
i
thrust
my
foot
sufficiently
inside
to
prevent
his
shutting
it
i
continued
to
address
him
you
sure
that
the
ward
is
full
two
hours
ago
what
am
i
to
do
do
know
what
you
to
do
is
the
next
nearest
workhouse
suddenly
opening
the
door
as
he
answered
me
putting
out
his
arm
he
thrust
me
backwards
before
i
could
recover
the
door
was
closed
the
man
in
rags
had
continued
a
grim
spectator
of
the
scene
now
he
spoke
bloke
ai
he
only
one
of
the
paupers
has
he
any
right
to
act
as
one
of
the
officials
tell
yer
some
of
them
paupers
is
wuss
than
the
orficers
a
long
sight
wuss
they
thinks
they
owns
the
blimey
they
do
oh
a
fine
world
this
is
he
paused
i
hesitated
for
some
time
there
had
been
a
suspicion
of
rain
in
the
air
now
it
was
commencing
to
fall
in
a
fine
but
soaking
drizzle
it
only
needed
that
to
fill
my
cup
to
overflowing
my
companion
was
regarding
me
with
a
sort
of
sullen
curiosity
you
got
no
money
a
farthing
much
of
this
sort
of
thing
the
first
time
i
been
to
a
casual
ward
and
it
does
seem
as
if
i
going
to
get
in
now
thought
you
looked
as
if
you
was
a
bit
what
are
yer
goin
to
do
far
is
it
to
kensington
about
three
mile
but
if
i
was
you
i
try
st
george
that
the
fulham
road
kensington
only
a
small
place
they
do
you
well
there
and
it
always
full
as
soon
as
the
door
opened
you
more
chawnce
at
st
george
he
was
silent
i
turned
his
words
over
in
my
mind
feeling
as
little
disposed
to
try
the
one
place
as
the
other
presently
he
began
again
travelled
from
reading
this
day
i
tramped
every
foot
and
all
the
way
as
i
come
along
i
a
shakedown
at
i
says
and
now
i
as
fur
off
from
it
as
ever
this
is
a
fine
country
this
is
i
wish
every
soul
in
it
was
swept
into
the
sea
blimey
i
do
but
i
ai
goin
to
go
no
further
a
bed
in
or
i
know
the
reason
why
are
you
going
to
manage
it
have
you
got
any
money
any
money
my
crikey
i
look
as
though
i
i
sound
as
though
i
too
i
ai
no
brads
now
and
then
a
brown
this
larst
six
months
are
you
going
to
get
a
bed
then
am
i
going
to
why
like
this
way
he
picked
up
two
stones
one
in
either
hand
the
one
in
his
left
he
flung
at
the
glass
which
was
over
the
door
of
the
casual
ward
it
crashed
through
it
and
through
the
lamp
beyond
i
goin
to
get
a
bed
the
door
was
hastily
opened
the
grizzled
pauper
reappeared
he
shouted
as
he
peered
at
us
in
the
darkness
done
that
done
it
guvnor
and
if
you
like
you
can
see
me
do
the
other
it
might
do
your
eyesight
good
before
the
grizzled
pauper
could
interfere
he
had
hurled
the
stone
in
his
right
hand
through
another
pane
i
felt
that
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
he
was
earning
a
night
rest
at
a
price
which
even
in
my
extremity
i
was
not
disposed
to
pay
when
i
left
two
or
three
other
persons
had
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
the
man
in
rags
was
addressing
them
with
a
degree
of
frankness
which
in
that
direction
left
little
to
be
desired
i
slunk
away
unnoticed
but
had
not
gone
far
before
i
had
almost
decided
that
i
might
as
well
have
thrown
in
my
fortune
with
the
bolder
wretch
and
smashed
a
window
too
indeed
more
than
once
my
feet
faltered
as
i
all
but
returned
to
do
the
feat
which
i
had
left
undone
a
more
miserable
night
for
an
excursion
i
could
hardly
have
chosen
the
rain
was
like
a
mist
and
was
not
only
drenching
me
to
the
skin
but
it
was
rendering
it
difficult
to
see
more
than
a
little
distance
in
any
direction
the
neighbourhood
was
badly
lighted
it
was
one
in
which
i
was
a
stranger
i
had
come
to
hammersmith
as
a
last
resource
it
had
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
tried
to
find
some
occupation
which
would
enable
me
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
in
every
other
part
of
london
and
that
now
only
hammersmith
was
left
and
at
hammersmith
even
the
workhouse
would
have
none
of
me
retreating
from
the
inhospitable
portal
of
the
casual
ward
i
had
taken
the
first
turning
to
the
left
and
at
the
moment
had
been
glad
to
take
it
in
the
darkness
and
the
rain
the
locality
which
i
was
entering
appeared
unfinished
i
seemed
to
be
leaving
civilisation
behind
me
the
path
was
unpaved
the
road
rough
and
uneven
as
if
it
had
never
been
properly
made
houses
were
few
and
far
between
those
which
i
did
encounter
seemed
in
the
imperfect
light
amid
the
general
desolation
to
be
cottages
which
were
crumbling
to
decay
exactly
where
i
was
i
could
not
tell
i
had
a
faint
notion
that
if
i
only
kept
on
long
enough
i
should
strike
some
part
of
walham
green
how
long
i
should
have
to
keep
on
i
could
only
guess
not
a
creature
seemed
to
be
about
of
whom
i
could
make
inquiries
it
was
as
if
i
was
in
a
land
of
desolation
i
suppose
it
was
between
eleven
and
midnight
i
had
not
given
up
my
quest
for
work
till
all
the
shops
were
closed
and
in
hammersmith
that
night
at
any
rate
they
were
not
early
closers
then
i
had
lounged
about
dispiritedly
wondering
what
was
the
next
thing
i
could
do
it
was
only
because
i
feared
that
if
i
attempted
to
spend
the
night
in
the
open
air
without
food
when
the
morning
came
i
should
be
broken
up
and
fit
for
nothing
that
i
sought
a
night
free
board
and
lodging
it
was
really
hunger
which
drove
me
to
the
workhouse
door
that
was
wednesday
since
the
sunday
night
preceding
nothing
had
passed
my
lips
save
water
from
the
public
fountains
with
the
exception
of
a
crust
of
bread
which
a
man
had
given
me
whom
i
had
found
crouching
at
the
root
of
a
tree
in
holland
park
for
three
days
i
had
been
fasting
practically
all
the
time
upon
my
feet
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
had
to
go
hungry
till
the
morning
i
should
collapse
there
would
be
an
end
yet
in
that
strange
and
inhospitable
place
where
was
i
to
get
food
at
that
time
of
night
and
how
i
do
not
know
how
far
i
went
every
yard
i
covered
my
feet
dragged
more
i
was
dead
beat
inside
and
out
i
had
neither
strength
nor
courage
left
and
within
there
was
that
frightful
craving
which
was
as
though
it
shrieked
aloud
i
leant
against
some
palings
dazed
and
giddy
if
only
death
had
come
upon
me
quickly
painlessly
how
true
a
friend
i
should
have
thought
it
it
was
the
agony
of
dying
inch
by
inch
which
was
so
hard
to
bear
it
was
some
minutes
before
i
could
collect
myself
sufficiently
to
withdraw
from
the
support
of
the
railings
and
to
start
afresh
i
stumbled
blindly
over
the
uneven
road
once
like
a
drunken
man
i
lurched
forward
and
fell
upon
my
knees
such
was
my
backboneless
state
that
for
some
seconds
i
remained
where
i
was
half
disposed
to
let
things
slide
accept
the
good
the
gods
had
sent
me
and
make
a
night
of
it
just
there
a
long
night
i
fancy
it
would
have
been
stretching
from
time
unto
eternity
having
regained
my
feet
i
had
gone
perhaps
another
couple
of
hundred
yards
along
the
road
heaven
knows
that
it
seemed
to
me
just
then
a
couple
of
miles
when
there
came
over
me
again
that
overpowering
giddiness
which
i
take
it
was
born
of
my
agony
of
hunger
i
staggered
helplessly
against
a
low
wall
which
just
there
was
at
the
side
of
the
path
without
it
i
should
have
fallen
in
a
heap
the
attack
appeared
to
last
for
hours
i
suppose
it
was
only
seconds
and
when
i
came
to
myself
it
was
as
though
i
had
been
aroused
from
a
swoon
of
sleep
aroused
to
an
extremity
of
pain
i
exclaimed
aloud
a
loaf
of
bread
what
would
i
do
i
looked
about
me
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
as
i
did
so
i
for
the
first
time
became
conscious
that
behind
me
was
a
house
it
was
not
a
large
one
it
was
one
of
those
villas
which
are
springing
up
in
multitudes
all
round
london
and
which
are
let
at
rentals
of
from
to
forty
pounds
a
year
it
was
detached
so
far
as
i
could
see
in
the
imperfect
light
there
was
not
another
building
within
twenty
or
thirty
yards
of
either
side
of
it
it
was
in
two
storeys
there
were
three
windows
in
the
upper
storey
behind
each
the
blinds
were
closely
drawn
the
hall
door
was
on
my
right
it
was
approached
by
a
little
wooden
gate
the
house
itself
was
so
close
to
the
public
road
that
by
leaning
over
the
wall
i
could
have
touched
either
of
the
windows
on
the
lower
floor
there
were
two
of
them
one
of
them
was
a
bow
window
the
bow
window
was
open
the
bottom
centre
sash
was
raised
about
six
inches
chapter
ii
inside
i
realised
and
so
to
speak
mentally
photographed
all
the
little
details
of
the
house
in
front
of
which
i
was
standing
with
what
almost
amounted
to
a
gleam
of
preternatural
perception
an
instant
before
the
world
swam
before
my
eyes
i
saw
nothing
now
i
saw
everything
with
a
clearness
which
as
it
were
was
shocking
above
all
i
saw
the
open
window
i
stared
at
it
conscious
as
i
did
so
of
a
curious
catching
of
the
breath
it
was
so
near
to
me
so
very
near
i
had
but
to
stretch
out
my
hand
to
thrust
it
through
the
aperture
once
inside
my
hand
would
at
least
be
dry
how
it
rained
out
there
my
scanty
clothing
was
soaked
i
was
wet
to
the
skin
i
was
shivering
and
each
second
it
seemed
to
rain
still
faster
my
teeth
were
chattering
the
damp
was
liquefying
the
very
marrow
in
my
bones
and
inside
that
open
window
it
was
it
must
be
so
warm
so
dry
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
not
a
human
being
anywhere
near
i
listened
there
was
not
a
sound
i
alone
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
sodden
night
of
all
god
creatures
the
only
one
unsheltered
from
the
fountains
of
heaven
which
he
had
opened
there
was
not
one
to
see
what
i
might
do
not
one
to
care
i
need
fear
no
spy
perhaps
the
house
was
empty
nay
probably
it
was
my
plain
duty
to
knock
at
the
door
rouse
the
inmates
and
call
attention
to
their
oversight
the
open
window
the
least
they
could
do
would
be
to
reward
me
for
my
pains
but
suppose
the
place
was
empty
what
would
be
the
use
of
knocking
it
would
be
to
make
a
useless
clatter
possibly
to
disturb
the
neighbourhood
for
nothing
and
even
if
the
people
were
at
home
i
might
go
unrewarded
i
had
learned
in
a
hard
school
the
ingratitude
to
have
caused
the
window
to
be
closed
the
inviting
window
the
tempting
window
the
convenient
window
and
then
to
be
no
better
for
it
after
all
but
still
to
be
penniless
hopeless
hungry
out
in
the
cold
and
the
rain
better
anything
than
that
in
such
a
situation
too
late
i
should
say
to
myself
that
mine
had
been
the
conduct
of
a
fool
and
i
should
say
it
justly
too
to
be
sure
leaning
over
the
low
wall
i
found
that
i
could
very
easily
put
my
hand
inside
the
room
how
warm
it
was
in
there
i
could
feel
the
difference
of
temperature
in
my
fingertips
very
quietly
i
stepped
right
over
the
wall
there
was
just
room
to
stand
in
comfort
between
the
window
and
the
wall
the
ground
felt
to
the
foot
as
if
it
were
cemented
stooping
down
i
peered
through
the
opening
i
could
see
nothing
it
was
black
as
pitch
inside
the
blind
was
drawn
right
up
it
seemed
incredible
that
anyone
could
be
at
home
and
have
gone
to
bed
leaving
the
blind
up
and
the
window
open
i
placed
my
ear
to
the
crevice
how
still
it
was
beyond
doubt
the
place
was
empty
i
decided
to
push
the
window
up
another
inch
or
two
so
as
to
enable
me
to
reconnoitre
if
anyone
caught
me
in
the
act
then
there
would
be
an
opportunity
to
describe
the
circumstances
and
to
explain
how
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
giving
the
alarm
only
i
must
go
carefully
in
such
damp
weather
it
was
probable
that
the
sash
would
creak
not
a
bit
of
it
it
moved
as
readily
and
as
noiselessly
as
if
it
had
been
oiled
this
silence
of
the
sash
so
emboldened
me
that
i
raised
it
more
than
i
intended
in
fact
as
far
as
it
would
go
not
by
a
sound
did
it
betray
me
bending
over
the
sill
i
put
my
head
and
half
my
body
into
the
room
but
i
was
no
forwarder
i
could
see
nothing
not
a
thing
for
all
i
could
tell
the
room
might
be
unfurnished
indeed
the
likelihood
of
such
an
explanation
began
to
occur
to
me
i
might
have
chanced
upon
an
empty
house
in
the
darkness
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
the
contrary
what
was
i
to
do
well
if
the
house
was
empty
in
such
a
plight
as
mine
i
might
be
said
to
have
a
moral
if
not
a
legal
right
to
its
bare
shelter
who
with
a
heart
in
his
bosom
would
deny
it
me
hardly
the
most
punctilious
landlord
raising
myself
by
means
of
the
sill
i
slipped
my
legs
into
the
room
the
moment
i
did
so
i
became
conscious
that
at
any
rate
the
room
was
not
entirely
unfurnished
the
floor
was
carpeted
i
have
had
my
feet
on
some
good
carpets
in
my
time
i
know
what
carpets
are
but
never
did
i
stand
upon
a
softer
one
than
that
it
reminded
me
somehow
even
then
of
the
turf
in
richmond
park
it
caressed
my
instep
and
sprang
beneath
my
tread
to
my
poor
feet
it
was
luxury
after
the
puddly
uneven
road
should
i
now
i
had
ascertained
that
the
room
was
at
least
partially
furnished
beat
a
retreat
or
should
i
push
my
researches
further
it
would
have
been
rapture
to
have
thrown
off
my
clothes
and
to
have
sunk
down
on
the
carpet
then
and
there
to
sleep
but
i
was
so
hungry
so
what
would
i
not
have
given
to
have
lighted
on
something
good
to
eat
i
moved
a
step
or
two
forward
gingerly
reaching
out
with
my
hands
lest
i
struck
unawares
against
some
unseen
thing
when
i
had
taken
three
or
four
such
steps
without
encountering
an
obstacle
or
indeed
anything
at
all
i
began
all
at
once
to
wish
i
had
not
seen
the
house
that
i
had
passed
it
by
that
i
had
not
come
through
the
window
that
i
were
safely
out
of
it
again
i
became
on
a
sudden
aware
that
something
was
with
me
in
the
room
there
was
nothing
ostensible
to
lead
me
to
such
a
conviction
it
may
be
that
my
faculties
were
unnaturally
keen
but
all
at
once
i
knew
that
there
was
something
there
what
was
more
i
had
a
horrible
persuasion
that
though
unseeing
i
was
seen
that
my
every
movement
was
being
watched
what
it
was
that
was
with
me
i
could
not
tell
i
could
not
even
guess
it
was
as
though
something
in
my
mental
organisation
had
been
stricken
by
a
sudden
paralysis
it
may
seem
childish
to
use
such
language
but
i
was
overwrought
played
out
physically
speaking
at
my
last
counter
and
in
an
instant
without
the
slightest
warning
i
was
conscious
of
a
very
curious
sensation
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
felt
before
and
the
like
of
which
i
pray
that
i
never
may
feel
again
a
sensation
of
panic
fear
i
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
on
which
i
stood
not
daring
to
move
fearing
to
draw
my
breath
i
felt
that
the
presence
with
me
in
the
room
was
something
strange
something
evil
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
stood
there
but
certainly
for
some
considerable
space
of
time
by
degrees
as
nothing
moved
nothing
was
seen
nothing
was
heard
and
nothing
happened
i
made
an
effort
to
better
play
the
man
i
knew
that
at
the
moment
i
played
the
cur
and
endeavoured
to
ask
myself
of
what
it
was
i
was
afraid
i
was
shivering
at
my
own
imaginings
what
could
be
in
the
room
to
have
suffered
me
to
open
the
window
and
to
enter
unopposed
whatever
it
was
was
surely
to
the
full
as
great
a
coward
as
i
was
or
why
permit
unchecked
my
burglarious
entry
since
i
had
been
allowed
to
enter
the
probability
was
that
i
should
be
at
liberty
to
retreat
and
i
was
sensible
of
a
much
keener
desire
to
retreat
than
i
had
ever
had
to
enter
i
had
to
put
the
greatest
amount
of
pressure
upon
myself
before
i
could
summon
up
sufficient
courage
to
enable
me
to
even
turn
my
head
upon
my
shoulders
and
the
moment
i
did
so
i
turned
it
back
again
what
constrained
me
to
save
my
soul
i
could
not
have
said
but
i
was
constrained
my
heart
was
palpitating
in
my
bosom
i
could
hear
it
beat
i
was
trembling
so
that
i
could
scarcely
stand
i
was
overwhelmed
by
a
fresh
flood
of
terror
i
stared
in
front
of
me
with
eyes
in
which
had
it
been
light
would
have
been
seen
the
frenzy
of
unreasoning
fear
my
ears
were
strained
so
that
i
listened
with
an
acuteness
of
tension
which
was
painful
something
moved
slightly
with
so
slight
a
sound
that
it
would
scarcely
have
been
audible
to
other
ears
save
mine
but
i
heard
i
was
looking
in
the
direction
from
which
the
movement
came
and
as
i
looked
i
saw
in
front
of
me
two
specks
of
light
they
had
not
been
there
a
moment
before
that
i
would
swear
they
were
there
now
they
were
eyes
i
told
myself
they
were
eyes
i
had
heard
how
cats
eyes
gleam
in
the
dark
though
i
had
never
seen
them
and
i
said
to
myself
that
these
were
cats
eyes
that
the
thing
in
front
of
me
was
nothing
but
a
cat
but
i
knew
i
lied
i
knew
that
these
were
eyes
and
i
knew
they
were
not
cats
eyes
but
what
eyes
they
were
i
did
not
know
nor
dared
to
think
they
moved
towards
me
the
creature
to
which
the
eyes
belonged
was
coming
closer
so
intense
was
my
desire
to
fly
that
i
would
much
rather
have
died
than
stood
there
still
yet
i
could
not
control
a
limb
my
limbs
were
as
if
they
were
not
mine
the
eyes
came
on
noiselessly
at
first
they
were
between
two
and
three
feet
from
the
ground
but
on
a
sudden
there
was
a
squelching
sound
as
if
some
yielding
body
had
been
squashed
upon
the
floor
the
eyes
vanished
to
reappear
a
moment
afterwards
at
what
i
judged
to
be
a
distance
of
some
six
inches
from
the
floor
and
they
again
came
on
so
it
seemed
that
the
creature
whatever
it
was
to
which
the
eyes
belonged
was
after
all
but
small
why
i
did
not
obey
the
frantic
longing
which
i
had
to
flee
from
it
i
can
not
tell
i
only
know
i
could
not
i
take
it
that
the
stress
and
privations
which
i
had
lately
undergone
and
which
i
was
even
then
still
undergoing
had
much
to
do
with
my
conduct
at
that
moment
and
with
the
part
i
played
in
all
that
followed
ordinarily
i
believe
that
i
have
as
high
a
spirit
as
the
average
man
and
as
solid
a
resolution
but
when
one
has
been
dragged
through
the
valley
of
humiliation
and
plunged
again
and
again
into
the
waters
of
bitterness
and
privation
a
man
can
be
constrained
to
a
course
of
action
of
which
in
his
happier
moments
he
would
have
deemed
himself
incapable
i
know
this
of
my
own
knowledge
slowly
the
eyes
came
on
with
a
strange
slowness
and
as
they
came
they
moved
from
side
to
side
as
if
their
owner
walked
unevenly
nothing
could
have
exceeded
the
horror
with
which
i
awaited
their
approach
except
my
incapacity
to
escape
them
not
for
an
instant
did
my
glance
pass
from
them
i
could
not
have
shut
my
eyes
for
all
the
gold
the
world
contains
so
that
as
they
came
closer
i
had
to
look
right
down
to
what
seemed
to
be
almost
the
level
of
my
feet
and
at
last
they
reached
my
feet
they
never
paused
on
a
sudden
i
felt
something
on
my
boot
and
with
a
sense
of
shrinking
horror
nausea
rendering
me
momentarily
more
helpless
i
realised
that
the
creature
was
beginning
to
ascend
my
legs
to
climb
my
body
even
then
what
it
was
i
could
not
tell
it
mounted
me
apparently
with
as
much
ease
as
if
i
had
been
horizontal
instead
of
perpendicular
it
was
as
though
it
were
some
gigantic
spider
a
spider
of
the
nightmares
a
monstrous
conception
of
some
dreadful
vision
it
pressed
lightly
against
my
clothing
with
what
might
for
all
the
world
have
been
spider
legs
there
was
an
amazing
host
of
them
i
felt
the
pressure
of
each
separate
one
they
embraced
me
softly
stickily
as
if
the
creature
glued
and
unglued
them
each
time
it
moved
higher
and
higher
it
had
gained
my
loins
it
was
moving
towards
the
pit
of
my
stomach
the
helplessness
with
which
i
suffered
its
invasion
was
not
the
least
part
of
my
agony
it
was
that
helplessness
which
we
know
in
dreadful
dreams
i
understood
quite
well
that
if
i
did
but
give
myself
a
hearty
shake
the
creature
would
fall
off
but
i
had
not
a
muscle
at
my
command
as
the
creature
mounted
its
eyes
began
to
play
the
part
of
two
small
lamps
they
positively
emitted
rays
of
light
by
their
rays
i
began
to
perceive
faint
outlines
of
its
body
it
seemed
larger
than
i
had
supposed
either
the
body
itself
was
slightly
phosphorescent
or
it
was
of
a
peculiar
yellow
hue
it
gleamed
in
the
darkness
what
it
was
there
was
still
nothing
to
positively
show
but
the
impression
grew
upon
me
that
it
was
some
member
of
the
spider
family
some
monstrous
member
of
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
heard
or
read
it
was
heavy
so
heavy
indeed
that
i
wondered
how
with
so
slight
a
pressure
it
managed
to
retain
its
hold
that
it
did
so
by
the
aid
of
some
adhesive
substance
at
the
end
of
its
legs
i
was
sure
i
could
feel
it
stick
its
weight
increased
as
it
ascended
and
it
smelt
i
had
been
for
some
time
aware
that
it
emitted
an
unpleasant
foetid
odour
as
it
neared
my
face
it
became
so
intense
as
to
be
unbearable
it
was
at
my
chest
i
became
more
and
more
conscious
of
an
uncomfortable
wobbling
motion
as
if
each
time
it
breathed
its
body
heaved
its
forelegs
touched
the
bare
skin
about
the
base
of
my
neck
they
stuck
to
it
shall
i
ever
forget
the
feeling
i
have
it
often
in
my
dreams
while
it
hung
on
with
those
in
front
it
seemed
to
draw
its
other
legs
up
after
it
it
crawled
up
my
neck
with
hideous
slowness
a
quarter
of
an
inch
at
a
time
its
weight
compelling
me
to
brace
the
muscles
of
my
back
it
reached
my
chin
it
touched
my
lips
and
i
stood
still
and
bore
it
all
while
it
enveloped
my
face
with
its
huge
slimy
body
and
embraced
me
with
its
myriad
legs
the
horror
of
it
made
me
mad
i
shook
myself
like
one
stricken
by
the
shaking
ague
i
shook
the
creature
off
it
squashed
upon
the
floor
shrieking
like
some
lost
spirit
turning
i
dashed
towards
the
window
as
i
went
my
foot
catching
in
some
obstacle
i
fell
headlong
to
the
floor
picking
myself
up
as
quickly
as
i
could
i
resumed
my
flight
rain
or
no
rain
oh
to
get
out
of
that
room
i
already
had
my
hand
upon
the
sill
in
another
instant
i
should
have
been
over
it
then
despite
my
hunger
my
fatigues
let
anyone
have
stopped
me
if
they
could
when
someone
behind
me
struck
a
light
chapter
iii
the
man
in
the
bed
the
illumination
which
instantly
followed
was
unexpected
it
startled
me
causing
a
moment
check
from
which
i
was
just
recovering
when
a
voice
said
still
there
was
a
quality
in
the
voice
which
i
can
not
describe
not
only
an
accent
of
command
but
a
something
malicious
a
something
saturnine
it
was
a
little
guttural
though
whether
it
was
a
man
speaking
i
could
not
have
positively
said
but
i
had
no
doubt
it
was
a
foreigner
it
was
the
most
disagreeable
voice
i
had
ever
heard
and
it
had
on
me
the
most
disagreeable
effect
for
when
it
said
still
i
kept
still
it
was
as
though
there
was
nothing
else
for
me
to
do
round
i
turned
round
mechanically
like
an
automaton
such
passivity
was
worse
than
undignified
it
was
galling
i
knew
that
well
i
resented
it
with
secret
rage
but
in
that
room
in
that
presence
i
was
invertebrate
when
i
turned
i
found
myself
confronting
someone
who
was
lying
in
bed
at
the
head
of
the
bed
was
a
shelf
on
the
shelf
was
a
small
lamp
which
gave
the
most
brilliant
light
i
had
ever
seen
it
caught
me
full
in
the
eyes
having
on
me
such
a
blinding
effect
that
for
some
seconds
i
could
see
nothing
throughout
the
whole
of
that
strange
interview
i
can
not
affirm
that
i
saw
clearly
the
dazzling
glare
caused
dancing
specks
to
obscure
my
vision
yet
after
an
interval
of
time
i
did
see
something
and
what
i
did
see
i
had
rather
have
left
unseen
i
saw
someone
in
front
of
me
lying
in
a
bed
i
could
not
at
once
decide
if
it
was
a
man
or
a
woman
indeed
at
first
i
doubted
if
it
was
anything
human
but
afterwards
i
knew
it
to
be
a
man
for
this
reason
if
for
no
other
that
it
was
impossible
such
a
creature
could
be
feminine
the
bedclothes
were
drawn
up
to
his
shoulders
only
his
head
was
visible
he
lay
on
his
left
side
his
head
resting
on
his
left
hand
motionless
eyeing
me
as
if
he
sought
to
read
my
inmost
soul
and
in
very
truth
i
believe
he
read
it
his
age
i
could
not
guess
such
a
look
of
age
i
had
never
imagined
had
he
asserted
that
he
had
been
living
through
the
ages
i
should
have
been
forced
to
admit
that
at
least
he
looked
it
and
yet
i
felt
that
it
was
quite
within
the
range
of
possibility
that
he
was
no
older
than
myself
there
was
a
vitality
in
his
eyes
which
was
startling
it
might
have
been
that
he
had
been
afflicted
by
some
terrible
disease
and
it
was
that
which
had
made
him
so
supernaturally
ugly
there
was
not
a
hair
upon
his
face
or
head
but
to
make
up
for
it
the
skin
which
was
a
saffron
yellow
was
an
amazing
mass
of
wrinkles
the
cranium
and
indeed
the
whole
skull
was
so
small
as
to
be
disagreeably
suggestive
of
something
animal
the
nose
on
the
other
hand
was
abnormally
large
so
extravagant
were
its
dimensions
and
so
peculiar
its
shape
it
resembled
the
beak
of
some
bird
of
prey
a
characteristic
of
the
face
and
an
uncomfortable
one
was
that
practically
it
stopped
short
at
the
mouth
the
mouth
with
its
blubber
lips
came
immediately
underneath
the
nose
and
chin
to
all
intents
and
purposes
there
was
none
this
deformity
for
the
absence
of
chin
amounted
to
that
it
was
which
gave
to
the
face
the
appearance
of
something
not
human
that
and
the
eyes
for
so
marked
a
feature
of
the
man
were
his
eyes
that
ere
long
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
nothing
but
eyes
his
eyes
ran
literally
across
the
whole
of
the
upper
portion
of
his
face
remember
the
face
was
unwontedly
small
and
the
columna
of
the
nose
was
they
were
long
and
they
looked
out
of
narrow
windows
and
they
seemed
to
be
lighted
by
some
internal
radiance
for
they
shone
out
like
lamps
in
a
lighthouse
tower
escape
them
i
could
not
while
as
i
endeavoured
to
meet
them
it
was
as
if
i
shrivelled
into
nothingness
never
before
had
i
realised
what
was
meant
by
the
power
of
the
eye
they
held
me
enchained
helpless
i
felt
that
they
could
do
with
me
as
they
would
and
they
did
their
gaze
was
unfaltering
having
the
trick
of
never
blinking
this
man
could
have
glared
at
me
for
hours
and
never
moved
an
eyelid
it
was
he
who
broke
the
silence
i
was
speechless
the
window
i
did
as
he
bade
me
down
the
blind
i
obeyed
round
again
i
was
still
obedient
is
your
name
then
i
spoke
to
answer
him
there
was
this
odd
thing
about
the
words
i
uttered
that
they
came
from
me
not
in
response
to
my
will
power
but
in
response
to
his
it
was
not
i
who
willed
that
i
should
speak
it
was
he
what
he
willed
that
i
should
say
i
said
just
that
and
nothing
more
for
the
time
i
was
no
longer
a
man
my
manhood
was
merged
in
his
i
was
in
the
extremest
sense
an
example
of
passive
obedience
holt
are
you
clerk
look
as
if
you
were
a
clerk
there
was
a
flame
of
scorn
in
his
voice
which
scorched
me
even
then
sort
of
a
clerk
are
you
am
out
of
a
situation
look
as
if
you
were
out
of
a
situation
again
the
scorn
you
the
sort
of
clerk
who
is
always
out
of
a
situation
you
are
a
thief
am
not
a
thief
clerks
come
through
the
window
i
was
still
he
putting
no
constraint
on
me
to
speak
did
you
come
through
the
window
it
was
open
do
you
always
come
through
a
window
which
is
open
why
through
this
i
was
wet
and
cold
and
hungry
and
tired
the
words
came
from
me
as
if
he
had
dragged
them
one
by
one
which
in
fact
he
did
you
no
home
what
sort
of
a
clerk
are
you
i
did
not
answer
him
i
did
not
know
what
it
was
he
wished
me
to
say
i
was
the
victim
of
bad
luck
nothing
else
i
swear
it
misfortune
had
followed
hard
upon
misfortune
the
firm
by
whom
i
had
been
employed
for
years
suspended
payment
i
obtained
a
situation
with
one
of
their
creditors
at
a
lower
salary
they
reduced
their
staff
which
entailed
my
going
after
an
interval
i
obtained
a
temporary
engagement
the
occasion
which
required
my
services
passed
and
i
with
it
after
another
and
a
longer
interval
i
again
found
temporary
employment
the
pay
for
which
was
but
a
pittance
when
that
was
over
i
could
find
nothing
that
was
nine
months
ago
and
since
then
i
had
not
earned
a
penny
it
is
so
easy
to
grow
shabby
when
you
are
on
the
everlasting
tramp
and
are
living
on
your
stock
of
clothes
i
had
trudged
all
over
london
in
search
of
work
work
of
any
kind
would
have
been
welcome
so
long
as
it
would
have
enabled
me
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
and
i
had
trudged
in
vain
now
i
had
been
refused
admittance
as
a
casual
how
easy
is
the
descent
but
i
did
not
tell
the
man
lying
on
the
bed
all
this
he
did
not
wish
to
hear
had
he
wished
he
would
have
made
me
tell
him
it
may
be
that
he
read
my
story
unspoken
though
it
was
it
is
conceivable
his
eyes
had
powers
of
penetration
which
were
peculiarly
their
own
that
i
know
when
he
spoke
again
that
was
what
he
said
in
those
guttural
tones
of
his
in
which
there
was
a
reminiscence
of
some
foreign
land
i
obeyed
letting
my
sodden
shabby
clothes
fall
anyhow
upon
the
floor
a
look
came
on
his
face
as
i
stood
naked
in
front
of
him
which
if
it
was
meant
for
a
smile
was
a
satyr
smile
and
which
filled
me
with
a
sensation
of
shuddering
repulsion
a
white
skin
you
have
how
white
what
would
i
not
give
for
a
skin
as
white
as
that
ah
yes
he
paused
devouring
me
with
his
glances
then
continued
to
the
cupboard
you
will
find
a
cloak
put
it
on
i
went
to
a
cupboard
which
was
in
a
corner
of
the
room
his
eyes
following
me
as
i
moved
it
was
full
of
clothing
garments
which
might
have
formed
the
of
a
costumier
whose
speciality
was
providing
costumes
for
masquerades
a
long
dark
cloak
hung
on
a
peg
my
hand
moved
towards
it
apparently
of
its
own
volition
i
put
it
on
its
ample
folds
falling
to
my
feet
the
other
cupboard
you
will
find
meat
and
bread
and
wine
eat
and
drink
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
near
the
head
of
his
bed
there
was
a
second
cupboard
in
this
upon
a
shelf
i
found
what
looked
like
pressed
beef
several
round
cakes
of
what
tasted
like
rye
bread
and
some
thin
sour
wine
in
a
flask
but
i
was
in
no
mood
to
criticise
i
crammed
myself
i
believe
like
some
famished
wolf
he
watching
me
in
silence
all
the
time
when
i
had
done
which
was
when
i
had
eaten
and
drunk
as
much
as
i
could
hold
there
returned
to
his
face
that
satyr
grin
would
that
i
could
eat
and
drink
like
that
ah
yes
put
back
what
is
left
i
put
it
back
which
seemed
an
unnecessary
exertion
there
was
so
little
to
put
me
in
the
face
i
looked
him
in
the
face
and
immediately
became
conscious
as
i
did
so
that
something
was
going
from
me
the
capacity
as
it
were
to
be
myself
his
eyes
grew
larger
and
larger
till
they
seemed
to
fill
all
space
till
i
became
lost
in
their
immensity
he
moved
his
hand
doing
something
to
me
i
know
not
what
as
it
passed
through
the
air
cutting
the
solid
ground
from
underneath
my
feet
so
that
i
fell
headlong
to
the
ground
where
i
fell
there
i
lay
like
a
log
and
the
light
went
out
chapter
iv
a
lonely
vigil
i
knew
that
the
light
went
out
for
not
the
least
singular
nor
indeed
the
least
distressing
part
of
my
condition
was
the
fact
that
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
i
never
once
lost
consciousness
during
the
long
hours
which
followed
i
was
aware
of
the
extinction
of
the
lamp
and
of
the
black
darkness
which
ensued
i
heard
a
rustling
sound
as
if
the
man
in
the
bed
was
settling
himself
between
the
sheets
then
all
was
still
and
throughout
that
interminable
night
i
remained
my
brain
awake
my
body
dead
waiting
watching
for
the
day
what
had
happened
to
me
i
could
not
guess
that
i
probably
wore
some
of
the
external
evidences
of
death
my
instinct
told
me
i
knew
i
did
paradoxical
though
it
may
sound
i
felt
as
a
man
might
feel
who
had
actually
died
as
in
moments
of
speculation
in
the
days
gone
by
i
had
imagined
it
as
quite
possible
that
he
would
feel
it
is
very
far
from
certain
that
feeling
necessarily
expires
with
what
we
call
life
i
continually
asked
myself
if
i
could
be
dead
the
inquiry
pressed
itself
on
me
with
awful
iteration
does
the
body
die
and
the
brain
the
i
the
ego
still
live
on
god
only
knows
but
then
the
agony
of
the
thought
the
hours
passed
by
slow
degrees
the
silence
was
eclipsed
sounds
of
traffic
of
hurrying
footsteps
life
were
ushers
of
the
morn
outside
the
window
sparrows
twittered
a
cat
mewed
a
dog
barked
there
was
the
clatter
of
a
milk
can
shafts
of
light
stole
past
the
blind
increasing
in
intensity
it
still
rained
now
and
again
it
pattered
against
the
pane
the
wind
must
have
shifted
because
for
the
first
time
there
came
on
a
sudden
the
clang
of
a
distant
clock
striking
the
hour
seven
then
with
the
interval
of
a
lifetime
between
each
chiming
eight
nine
ten
so
far
in
the
room
itself
there
had
not
been
a
sound
when
the
clock
had
struck
ten
as
it
seemed
to
me
years
ago
there
came
a
rustling
noise
from
the
direction
of
the
bed
feet
stepped
upon
the
floor
moving
towards
where
i
was
lying
it
was
of
course
now
broad
day
and
i
presently
perceived
that
a
figure
clad
in
some
queer
coloured
garment
was
standing
at
my
side
looking
down
at
me
it
stooped
then
knelt
my
only
covering
was
unceremoniously
thrown
from
off
me
so
that
i
lay
there
in
my
nakedness
fingers
prodded
me
then
and
there
as
if
i
had
been
some
beast
ready
for
the
butcher
stall
a
face
looked
into
mine
and
in
front
of
me
were
those
dreadful
eyes
then
whether
i
was
dead
or
living
i
said
to
myself
that
this
could
be
nothing
human
nothing
fashioned
in
god
image
could
wear
such
a
shape
as
that
fingers
were
pressed
into
my
cheeks
they
were
thrust
into
my
mouth
they
touched
my
staring
eyes
shut
my
eyelids
then
opened
them
again
and
horror
of
horrors
the
blubber
lips
were
pressed
to
mine
the
soul
of
something
evil
entered
into
me
in
the
guise
of
a
kiss
then
this
travesty
of
manhood
reascended
to
his
feet
and
said
whether
speaking
to
me
or
to
himself
i
could
not
tell
dead
as
good
as
dead
and
better
we
have
him
buried
he
moved
away
from
me
i
heard
a
door
open
and
shut
and
knew
that
he
was
gone
and
he
continued
gone
throughout
the
day
i
had
no
actual
knowledge
of
his
issuing
out
into
the
street
but
he
must
have
done
so
because
the
house
appeared
deserted
what
had
become
of
the
dreadful
creature
of
the
night
before
i
could
not
guess
my
first
fear
was
that
he
had
left
it
behind
him
in
the
room
with
me
it
might
be
as
a
sort
of
watchdog
but
as
the
minutes
and
the
hours
passed
and
there
was
still
no
sign
or
sound
of
anything
living
i
concluded
that
if
the
thing
was
there
it
was
possibly
as
helpless
as
myself
and
that
during
its
absence
at
any
rate
i
had
nothing
to
fear
from
its
too
pressing
attentions
that
with
the
exception
of
myself
the
house
held
nothing
human
i
had
strong
presumptive
proof
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
the
day
several
times
both
in
the
morning
and
the
afternoon
people
without
endeavoured
to
attract
the
attention
of
whoever
was
within
vehicles
probably
tradesmen
carts
drew
up
in
front
their
stopping
being
followed
by
more
or
less
assiduous
assaults
upon
the
knocker
and
the
bell
but
in
every
case
their
appeals
remained
unheeded
whatever
it
was
they
wanted
they
had
to
go
unsatisfied
away
lying
there
torpid
with
nothing
to
do
but
listen
i
was
possibly
struck
by
very
little
but
it
did
occur
to
me
that
one
among
the
callers
was
more
persistent
than
the
rest
the
distant
clock
had
just
struck
noon
when
i
heard
the
gate
open
and
someone
approached
the
front
door
since
nothing
but
silence
followed
i
supposed
that
the
occupant
of
the
place
had
returned
and
had
chosen
to
do
so
as
silently
as
he
had
gone
presently
however
there
came
from
the
doorstep
a
slight
but
peculiar
call
as
if
a
rat
was
squeaking
it
was
repeated
three
times
and
then
there
was
the
sound
of
footsteps
quietly
retreating
and
the
gate
between
one
and
two
the
caller
came
again
there
was
a
repetition
of
the
same
signal
that
it
was
a
signal
i
did
not
doubt
followed
by
the
same
retreat
about
three
the
mysterious
visitant
returned
the
signal
was
repeated
and
when
there
was
no
response
fingers
tapped
softly
against
the
panels
of
the
front
door
when
there
was
still
no
answer
footsteps
stole
softly
round
the
side
of
the
house
and
there
came
the
signal
from
the
rear
and
then
again
tapping
of
fingers
against
what
was
apparently
the
back
door
no
notice
being
taken
of
these
various
proceedings
the
footsteps
returned
the
way
they
went
and
as
before
the
gate
was
closed
shortly
after
darkness
had
fallen
this
assiduous
caller
returned
to
make
a
fourth
and
more
resolute
attempt
to
call
attention
to
his
presence
from
the
peculiar
character
of
his
manoeuvres
it
seemed
that
he
suspected
that
whoever
was
within
had
particular
reasons
for
ignoring
him
without
he
went
through
the
familiar
pantomime
of
the
three
squeaky
calls
both
at
the
front
door
and
the
back
followed
by
the
tapping
of
the
fingers
on
the
panels
this
time
however
he
also
tried
the
window
panes
i
could
hear
quite
distinctly
the
clear
yet
distinct
noise
of
what
seemed
like
knuckles
rapping
against
the
windows
behind
disappointed
there
he
renewed
his
efforts
at
the
front
the
curiously
quiet
footsteps
came
round
the
house
to
pause
before
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
i
lay
and
then
something
singular
occurred
while
i
waited
for
the
tapping
there
came
instead
the
sound
of
someone
or
something
scrambling
on
to
the
as
if
some
creature
unable
to
reach
the
window
from
the
ground
was
endeavouring
to
gain
the
vantage
of
the
sill
some
ungainly
creature
unskilled
in
surmounting
such
an
obstacle
as
a
perpendicular
brick
wall
there
was
the
noise
of
what
seemed
to
be
the
scratching
of
claws
as
if
it
experienced
considerable
difficulty
in
obtaining
a
hold
on
the
unyielding
surface
what
kind
of
creature
it
was
i
could
not
think
i
was
astonished
to
find
that
it
was
a
creature
at
all
i
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
persevering
visitor
was
either
a
woman
or
a
man
if
however
as
now
seemed
likely
it
was
some
sort
of
animal
the
fact
explained
the
squeaking
sounds
though
what
except
a
rat
did
squeak
like
that
was
more
than
i
could
say
and
the
absence
of
any
knocking
or
ringing
whatever
it
was
it
had
gained
the
summit
of
its
desires
the
it
panted
as
if
its
efforts
at
climbing
had
made
it
short
of
breath
then
began
the
tapping
in
the
light
of
my
new
discovery
i
perceived
clearly
enough
that
the
tapping
was
hardly
that
which
was
likely
to
be
the
product
of
human
fingers
it
was
sharp
and
definite
rather
resembling
the
striking
of
the
point
of
a
nail
against
the
glass
it
was
not
loud
but
in
time
it
continued
with
much
persistency
it
became
plainly
vicious
it
was
accompanied
by
what
i
can
only
describe
as
the
most
extraordinary
noises
there
were
squeaks
growing
angrier
and
shriller
as
the
minutes
passed
what
seemed
like
gaspings
for
breath
and
a
peculiar
buzzing
sound
like
yet
unlike
the
purring
of
a
cat
the
creature
resentment
at
its
want
of
success
in
attracting
attention
was
unmistakable
the
tapping
became
like
the
clattering
of
hailstones
it
kept
up
a
continuous
noise
with
its
cries
and
pantings
there
was
the
sound
as
of
some
large
body
being
rubbed
against
the
glass
as
if
it
were
extending
itself
against
the
window
and
endeavouring
by
force
of
pressure
to
gain
an
entrance
through
the
pane
so
violent
did
its
contortions
become
that
i
momentarily
anticipated
the
yielding
of
the
glass
and
the
excited
assailant
coming
crashing
through
considerably
to
my
relief
the
window
proved
more
impregnable
than
seemed
at
one
time
likely
the
stolid
resistance
proved
in
the
end
to
be
too
much
either
for
its
endurance
or
its
patience
just
as
i
was
looking
for
some
fresh
manifestation
of
fury
it
seemed
rather
to
tumble
than
to
spring
off
the
sill
then
came
once
more
the
same
sound
of
quietly
retreating
footsteps
and
what
under
the
circumstances
seemed
odder
still
the
same
closing
of
the
gate
during
the
two
or
three
hours
which
immediately
ensued
nothing
happened
at
all
out
of
the
way
and
then
took
place
the
most
surprising
incident
of
all
the
clock
had
struck
ten
some
time
before
since
before
the
striking
of
the
hour
nothing
and
no
one
had
passed
along
what
was
evidently
the
little
frequented
road
in
front
of
that
uncanny
house
on
a
sudden
two
sounds
broke
the
stillness
without
of
someone
running
and
of
cries
judging
from
his
hurrying
steps
someone
seemed
to
be
flying
for
his
life
to
the
accompaniment
of
curious
cries
it
was
only
when
the
runner
reached
the
front
of
the
house
that
in
the
cries
i
recognised
the
squeaks
of
the
persistent
caller
i
imagined
that
he
had
returned
as
before
alone
to
renew
his
attacks
upon
the
window
until
it
was
made
plain
as
it
quickly
was
that
with
him
was
some
sort
of
a
companion
immediately
there
arose
from
without
the
noise
of
battle
two
creatures
whose
cries
were
to
me
of
so
unusual
a
character
that
i
found
it
impossible
to
even
guess
at
their
identity
seemed
to
be
waging
war
to
the
knife
upon
the
doorstep
after
a
minute
or
two
of
furious
contention
victory
seemed
to
rest
with
one
of
the
combatants
for
the
other
fled
squeaking
as
with
pain
while
i
listened
with
strained
attention
for
the
next
episode
in
this
queer
drama
expecting
that
now
would
come
another
assault
upon
the
window
to
my
unbounded
surprise
i
heard
a
key
thrust
in
the
keyhole
the
lock
turned
and
the
front
door
thrown
open
with
a
furious
bang
it
was
closed
as
loudly
as
it
was
opened
then
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
i
was
was
dashed
open
with
the
same
display
of
excitement
and
of
clamour
footsteps
came
hurrying
in
the
door
was
slammed
to
with
a
force
which
shook
the
house
to
its
foundations
there
was
a
rustling
as
of
the
brilliant
illumination
of
the
night
before
and
a
voice
which
i
had
only
too
good
reason
to
remember
said
up
i
stood
up
automatically
at
the
word
of
command
facing
towards
the
bed
there
between
the
sheets
with
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
in
the
attitude
in
which
i
had
seen
him
last
was
the
being
i
had
made
acquaintance
with
under
circumstances
which
i
was
never
likely
to
forget
the
same
yet
not
the
same
chapter
v
an
instruction
to
commit
burglary
that
the
man
in
the
bed
was
the
one
whom
to
my
cost
i
had
suffered
myself
to
stumble
on
the
night
before
there
could
of
course
not
be
the
faintest
doubt
and
yet
directly
i
saw
him
i
recognised
that
some
astonishing
alteration
had
taken
place
in
his
appearance
to
begin
with
he
seemed
younger
the
decrepitude
of
age
had
given
place
to
something
very
like
the
fire
of
youth
his
features
had
undergone
some
subtle
change
his
nose
for
instance
was
not
by
any
means
so
grotesque
its
quality
was
less
conspicuous
the
most
part
of
his
wrinkles
had
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
and
though
his
skin
was
still
as
yellow
as
saffron
his
contours
had
rounded
he
had
even
come
into
possession
of
a
modest
allowance
of
chin
but
the
most
astounding
novelty
was
that
about
the
face
there
was
something
which
was
essentially
feminine
so
feminine
indeed
that
i
wondered
if
i
could
by
any
possibility
have
blundered
and
mistaken
a
woman
for
a
man
some
ghoulish
example
of
her
sex
who
had
so
yielded
to
her
depraved
instincts
as
to
have
become
nothing
but
a
ghastly
reminiscence
of
womanhood
the
effect
of
the
changes
which
had
come
about
in
his
appearance
for
after
all
i
told
myself
that
it
was
impossible
that
i
could
have
been
such
a
simpleton
as
to
have
been
mistaken
on
such
a
question
as
gender
was
heightened
by
the
fact
that
very
recently
he
had
been
engaged
in
some
pitched
battle
some
hand
to
hand
and
probably
discreditable
encounter
from
which
he
had
borne
away
uncomfortable
proofs
of
his
opponent
prowess
his
antagonist
could
hardly
have
been
a
chivalrous
fighter
for
his
countenance
was
marked
by
a
dozen
different
scratches
which
seemed
to
suggest
that
the
weapons
used
had
been
someone
it
was
perhaps
because
the
heat
of
the
battle
was
still
in
his
veins
that
he
was
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
he
seemed
to
be
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
strength
of
his
own
feelings
his
eyes
seemed
literally
to
flame
with
fire
the
muscles
of
his
face
were
working
as
if
they
were
wholly
beyond
his
own
control
when
he
spoke
his
accent
was
markedly
foreign
the
words
rushed
from
his
lips
in
an
inarticulate
torrent
he
kept
repeating
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
in
a
fashion
which
was
not
a
little
suggestive
of
insanity
you
not
dead
you
not
dead
you
alive
you
alive
well
how
does
it
feel
to
be
dead
i
ask
you
is
it
not
good
to
be
dead
to
keep
dead
is
better
it
is
the
best
of
all
to
have
made
an
end
of
all
things
to
cease
to
strive
and
to
cease
to
weep
to
cease
to
want
and
to
cease
to
have
to
cease
to
annoy
and
to
cease
to
long
to
no
more
care
no
not
for
anything
to
put
from
you
the
curse
of
life
forever
is
that
not
the
best
oh
yes
i
tell
you
do
i
not
know
but
for
you
such
knowledge
is
not
yet
for
you
there
is
the
return
to
life
the
coming
out
of
death
you
shall
live
on
for
me
live
on
he
made
a
movement
with
his
hand
and
directly
he
did
so
it
happened
as
on
the
previous
evening
that
a
metamorphosis
took
place
in
the
very
abysses
of
my
being
i
woke
from
my
torpor
as
he
put
it
i
came
out
of
death
and
was
alive
again
i
was
far
yet
from
being
my
own
man
i
realised
that
he
exercised
on
me
a
degree
of
mesmeric
force
which
i
had
never
dreamed
that
one
creature
could
exercise
on
another
but
at
least
i
was
no
longer
in
doubt
as
to
whether
i
was
or
was
not
dead
i
knew
i
was
alive
he
lay
watching
me
as
if
he
was
reading
the
thoughts
which
occupied
my
brain
and
for
all
i
know
he
was
holt
you
are
a
thief
am
not
my
own
voice
as
i
heard
it
startled
me
it
was
so
long
since
it
had
sounded
in
my
ears
are
a
thief
only
thieves
come
through
windows
did
you
not
come
through
the
window
i
was
still
what
would
my
contradiction
have
availed
me
it
is
well
that
you
came
through
the
window
well
you
are
a
thief
well
for
me
for
me
it
is
you
that
i
am
wanting
at
the
happy
moment
you
have
dropped
yourself
into
my
hands
in
the
nick
of
time
for
you
are
my
slave
at
my
beck
and
call
my
familiar
spirit
to
do
with
as
i
will
you
know
this
eh
i
did
know
it
and
the
knowledge
of
my
impotence
was
terrible
i
felt
that
if
i
could
only
get
away
from
him
only
release
myself
from
the
bonds
with
which
he
had
bound
me
about
only
remove
myself
from
the
horrible
glamour
of
his
near
neighbourhood
only
get
one
or
two
square
meals
and
have
an
opportunity
of
recovering
from
the
enervating
stress
of
mental
and
bodily
fatigue
i
felt
that
then
i
might
be
something
like
his
match
and
that
a
second
time
he
would
endeavour
in
vain
to
bring
me
within
the
compass
of
his
magic
but
as
it
was
i
was
conscious
that
i
was
helpless
and
the
consciousness
was
agony
he
persisted
in
reiterating
his
former
falsehood
say
you
are
a
thief
a
thief
robert
holt
a
thief
you
came
through
a
window
for
your
own
pleasure
now
you
will
go
through
a
window
for
mine
not
this
window
but
another
where
the
jest
lay
i
did
not
perceive
but
it
tickled
him
for
a
grating
sound
came
from
his
throat
which
was
meant
for
laughter
time
it
is
as
a
thief
that
you
will
go
oh
yes
be
sure
he
paused
as
it
seemed
to
transfix
me
with
his
gaze
his
unblinking
eyes
never
for
an
instant
quitted
my
face
with
what
a
frightful
fascination
they
constrained
me
and
how
i
loathed
them
when
he
spoke
again
there
was
a
new
intonation
in
his
speech
something
bitter
cruel
unrelenting
you
know
paul
lessingham
he
pronounced
the
name
as
if
he
hated
it
and
yet
as
if
he
loved
to
have
it
on
his
tongue
paul
lessingham
is
only
one
paul
lessingham
the
paul
lessingham
the
great
paul
lessingham
he
shrieked
rather
than
said
this
with
an
outburst
of
rage
so
frenzied
that
i
thought
for
the
moment
that
he
was
going
to
spring
on
me
and
rend
me
i
shook
all
over
i
do
not
doubt
that
as
i
replied
my
voice
was
sufficiently
tremulous
the
world
knows
paul
lessingham
the
politician
the
statesman
as
he
glared
at
me
his
eyes
dilated
i
still
stood
in
expectation
of
a
physical
assault
but
for
the
present
he
contented
himself
with
words
you
are
going
through
his
window
like
a
thief
i
had
no
inkling
of
his
meaning
and
apparently
judging
from
his
next
words
i
looked
something
of
the
bewilderment
i
felt
do
not
understand
no
it
is
simple
what
could
be
simpler
i
say
that
you
are
going
through
his
window
like
a
thief
you
came
through
my
window
why
not
through
the
window
of
paul
lessingham
the
politician
the
statesman
he
repeated
my
words
as
if
in
mockery
i
am
i
make
it
my
boast
of
that
great
multitude
which
regards
paul
lessingham
as
the
greatest
living
force
in
practical
politics
and
which
looks
to
him
with
confidence
to
carry
through
that
great
work
of
constitutional
and
social
reform
which
he
has
set
himself
to
do
i
daresay
that
my
tone
in
speaking
of
him
savoured
of
laudation
which
plainly
the
man
in
the
bed
resented
what
he
meant
by
his
wild
words
about
my
going
through
paul
lessingham
window
like
a
thief
i
still
had
not
the
faintest
notion
they
sounded
like
the
ravings
of
a
madman
as
i
continued
silent
and
he
yet
stared
there
came
into
his
tone
another
note
a
note
of
tenderness
a
note
of
which
i
had
not
deemed
him
capable
is
good
to
look
at
paul
lessingham
is
he
not
good
to
look
at
i
was
aware
that
physically
mr
lessingham
was
a
fine
specimen
of
manhood
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
assertion
of
the
fact
in
such
a
quarter
nor
for
the
manner
in
which
the
temporary
master
of
my
fate
continued
to
harp
and
enlarge
upon
the
theme
is
straight
straight
as
the
mast
of
a
ship
he
is
tall
his
skin
is
white
he
is
strong
do
i
not
know
that
he
is
strong
how
strong
oh
yes
is
there
a
better
thing
than
to
be
his
wife
his
the
light
of
his
eyes
is
there
for
a
woman
a
happier
chance
oh
no
not
one
his
wife
paul
lessingham
as
with
soft
cadences
he
gave
vent
to
these
sentiments
the
fashion
of
his
countenance
was
changed
a
look
of
longing
came
into
his
face
of
savage
frantic
longing
which
unalluring
though
it
was
for
the
moment
transfigured
him
but
the
mood
was
transient
be
his
wife
oh
yes
the
wife
of
his
scorn
the
despised
and
rejected
the
return
to
the
venom
of
his
former
bitterness
was
rapid
i
could
not
but
feel
that
this
was
the
natural
man
though
why
a
creature
such
as
he
was
should
go
out
of
his
way
to
apostrophise
in
such
a
manner
a
publicist
of
mr
lessingham
eminence
surpassed
my
comprehension
yet
he
stuck
to
his
subject
like
a
leech
as
if
it
had
been
one
in
which
he
had
an
engrossing
personal
interest
is
a
devil
hard
as
the
granite
rock
cold
as
the
snows
of
ararat
in
him
there
is
none
of
life
warm
blood
he
is
accursed
he
is
false
ay
false
as
the
fables
of
those
who
lie
for
love
of
lies
he
is
all
treachery
her
whom
he
has
taken
to
his
bosom
he
would
put
away
from
him
as
if
she
had
never
been
he
would
steal
from
her
like
a
thief
in
the
night
he
would
forget
she
ever
was
but
the
avenger
follows
after
lurking
in
the
shadows
hiding
among
the
rocks
waiting
watching
till
his
time
shall
come
and
it
shall
come
the
day
of
the
avenger
ay
the
day
raising
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
he
threw
his
arms
above
his
head
and
shrieked
with
a
demoniac
fury
presently
he
became
a
trifle
calmer
reverting
to
his
recumbent
position
resting
his
head
upon
his
hand
he
eyed
me
steadily
then
asked
me
a
question
which
struck
me
as
being
under
the
circumstances
more
than
a
little
singular
know
his
house
the
house
of
the
great
paul
lessingham
the
politician
the
statesman
do
not
lie
you
do
the
words
came
from
him
with
a
sort
of
snarl
as
if
he
would
have
lashed
me
across
the
face
with
them
do
not
men
in
my
position
are
not
acquainted
with
the
residences
of
men
in
his
i
may
at
some
time
have
seen
his
address
in
print
but
if
so
i
have
forgotten
it
he
looked
at
me
intently
for
some
moments
as
if
to
learn
if
i
spoke
the
truth
and
apparently
at
last
was
satisfied
that
i
did
do
not
know
it
well
i
will
show
it
you
i
will
show
the
house
of
the
great
paul
lessingham
what
he
meant
i
did
not
know
but
i
was
soon
to
learn
an
astounding
revelation
it
proved
to
be
there
was
about
his
manner
something
hardly
human
something
which
for
want
of
a
better
phrase
i
would
call
vulpine
in
his
tone
there
was
a
mixture
of
mockery
and
bitterness
as
if
he
wished
his
words
to
have
the
effect
of
corrosive
sublimate
and
to
sear
me
as
he
uttered
them
with
all
your
ears
give
me
your
whole
attention
hearken
to
my
bidding
so
that
you
may
do
as
i
bid
you
not
that
i
fear
your
obedience
oh
no
he
paused
as
if
to
enable
me
to
fully
realise
the
picture
of
my
helplessness
conjured
up
by
his
jibes
came
through
my
window
like
a
thief
you
will
go
through
my
window
like
a
fool
you
will
go
to
the
house
of
the
great
paul
lessingham
you
say
you
do
not
know
it
well
i
will
show
it
you
i
will
be
your
guide
unseen
in
the
darkness
and
the
night
i
will
stalk
beside
you
and
will
lead
you
to
where
i
would
have
you
you
will
go
just
as
you
are
with
bare
feet
and
head
uncovered
and
with
but
a
single
garment
to
hide
your
nakedness
you
will
be
cold
your
feet
will
be
cut
and
bleeding
but
what
better
does
a
thief
deserve
if
any
see
you
at
the
least
they
will
take
you
for
a
madman
there
will
be
trouble
but
have
no
fear
bear
a
bold
heart
none
shall
see
you
while
i
stalk
at
your
side
i
will
cover
you
with
the
cloak
of
invisibility
so
that
you
may
come
in
safety
to
the
house
of
the
great
paul
lessingham
he
paused
again
what
he
said
wild
and
wanton
though
it
was
was
beginning
to
fill
me
with
a
sense
of
the
most
extreme
discomfort
his
sentences
in
some
strange
indescribable
way
seemed
as
they
came
from
his
lips
to
warp
my
limbs
to
enwrap
themselves
about
me
to
confine
me
tighter
and
tighter
within
as
it
were
swaddling
clothes
to
make
me
more
and
more
helpless
i
was
already
conscious
that
whatever
mad
freak
he
chose
to
set
me
on
i
should
have
no
option
but
to
carry
it
through
you
come
to
the
house
you
will
stand
and
look
and
seek
for
a
window
convenient
for
entry
it
may
be
that
you
will
find
one
open
as
you
did
mine
if
not
you
will
open
one
how
that
is
your
affair
not
mine
you
will
practise
the
arts
of
a
thief
to
steal
into
his
house
the
monstrosity
of
his
suggestion
fought
against
the
spell
which
he
again
was
casting
upon
me
and
forced
me
into
speech
endowed
me
with
the
power
to
show
that
there
still
was
in
me
something
of
a
man
though
every
second
the
strands
of
my
manhood
as
it
seemed
were
slipping
faster
through
the
fingers
which
were
strained
to
clutch
them
will
not
he
was
silent
he
looked
at
me
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
dilated
until
they
seemed
all
pupil
do
you
hear
i
say
you
will
am
not
a
thief
i
am
an
honest
man
why
should
i
do
this
thing
i
bid
you
mercy
whom
on
you
or
on
paul
lessingham
who
at
any
time
has
shown
mercy
unto
me
that
i
should
show
mercy
unto
any
he
stopped
and
then
again
went
on
reiterating
his
former
incredible
suggestion
with
an
emphasis
which
seemed
to
eat
its
way
into
my
brain
will
practise
the
arts
of
a
thief
to
steal
into
his
house
and
being
in
will
listen
if
all
be
still
you
will
make
your
way
to
the
room
he
calls
his
study
shall
i
find
it
i
know
nothing
of
his
house
the
question
was
wrung
from
me
i
felt
that
the
sweat
was
standing
in
great
drops
upon
my
brow
will
show
it
you
you
go
with
me
i
shall
go
with
you
all
the
time
i
shall
be
with
you
you
will
not
see
me
but
i
shall
be
there
be
not
afraid
his
claim
to
supernatural
powers
for
what
he
said
amounted
to
nothing
less
was
on
the
face
of
it
preposterous
but
then
i
was
in
no
condition
to
even
hint
at
its
absurdity
he
continued
you
have
gained
the
study
you
will
go
to
a
certain
drawer
which
is
in
a
certain
bureau
in
a
corner
of
the
room
i
see
it
now
when
you
are
there
you
shall
see
it
too
and
you
will
open
it
it
be
locked
still
will
open
it
how
shall
i
open
it
if
it
is
locked
those
arts
in
which
a
thief
is
skilled
i
say
to
you
again
that
that
is
your
affair
not
mine
i
made
no
attempt
to
answer
him
even
supposing
that
he
forced
me
by
the
wicked
and
unconscionable
exercise
of
what
i
presumed
were
the
hypnotic
powers
with
which
nature
had
to
such
a
dangerous
degree
endowed
him
to
carry
the
adventure
to
a
certain
stage
since
he
could
hardly
at
an
instant
notice
endow
me
with
the
knack
of
picking
locks
should
the
drawer
he
alluded
to
be
locked
which
might
providence
permit
nothing
serious
might
issue
from
it
after
all
he
read
my
thoughts
will
open
it
though
it
be
doubly
and
trebly
locked
i
say
that
you
will
open
in
it
you
will
find
he
hesitated
as
if
to
reflect
letters
it
may
be
two
or
three
i
know
not
just
how
many
they
are
bound
about
by
a
silken
ribbon
you
will
take
them
out
of
the
drawer
and
having
taken
them
you
will
make
the
best
of
your
way
out
of
the
house
and
bear
them
back
to
me
should
anyone
come
upon
me
while
engaged
in
these
nefarious
proceedings
for
instance
should
i
encounter
mr
lessingham
himself
what
then
lessingham
you
need
have
no
fear
if
you
encounter
him
need
have
no
fear
if
he
finds
me
in
his
own
house
at
dead
of
night
committing
burglary
need
have
no
fear
of
him
your
account
or
on
my
own
at
least
he
will
have
me
haled
to
gaol
say
you
need
have
no
fear
of
him
i
say
what
i
mean
then
shall
i
escape
his
righteous
vengeance
he
is
not
the
man
to
suffer
a
midnight
robber
to
escape
him
scatheless
shall
i
have
to
kill
him
will
not
touch
him
with
a
finger
nor
will
he
touch
you
what
spell
shall
i
prevent
him
the
spell
of
two
words
words
are
they
paul
lessingham
chance
to
come
upon
you
and
find
you
in
his
house
a
thief
and
should
seek
to
stay
you
from
whatever
it
is
you
may
be
at
you
will
not
flinch
nor
flee
from
him
but
you
will
stand
still
and
you
will
say
something
in
the
crescendo
accents
of
his
voice
something
weird
and
ominous
caused
my
heart
to
press
against
my
ribs
so
that
when
he
stopped
in
my
eagerness
i
cried
out
beetle
as
the
words
came
from
him
in
a
kind
of
screech
the
lamp
went
out
and
the
place
was
all
in
darkness
and
i
knew
so
that
the
knowledge
filled
me
with
a
sense
of
loathing
that
with
me
in
the
room
was
the
evil
presence
of
the
night
before
two
bright
specks
gleamed
in
front
of
me
something
flopped
from
off
the
bed
on
to
the
ground
the
thing
was
coming
towards
me
across
the
floor
it
came
slowly
on
and
on
and
on
i
stood
still
speechless
in
the
sickness
of
my
horror
until
on
my
bare
feet
it
touched
me
with
slimy
feelers
and
my
terror
lest
it
should
creep
up
my
naked
body
lent
me
voice
and
i
fell
shrieking
like
a
soul
in
agony
it
may
be
that
my
shrieking
drove
it
from
me
at
least
it
went
i
knew
it
went
and
all
was
still
until
on
a
sudden
the
lamp
flamed
out
again
and
there
lying
as
before
in
bed
glaring
at
me
with
his
baleful
eyes
was
the
being
whom
in
my
folly
or
in
my
wisdom
whichever
it
was
i
was
beginning
to
credit
with
the
possession
of
unhallowed
unlawful
powers
will
say
that
to
him
those
two
words
they
only
no
more
and
you
will
see
what
you
will
see
but
paul
lessingham
is
a
man
of
resolution
should
he
still
persist
in
interference
or
seek
to
hinder
you
you
will
say
those
two
words
again
you
need
do
no
more
twice
will
suffice
i
promise
now
draw
up
the
blind
open
the
window
climb
through
it
hasten
to
do
what
i
have
bidden
you
i
wait
here
for
your
return
and
all
the
way
i
shall
be
with
you
chapter
vi
a
singular
felony
i
went
to
the
window
i
drew
up
the
blind
unlatching
the
sash
i
threw
it
open
and
clad
or
rather
unclad
as
i
was
i
clambered
through
it
into
the
open
air
i
was
not
only
incapable
of
resistance
i
was
incapable
of
distinctly
formulating
the
desire
to
offer
resistance
some
compelling
influence
moved
me
hither
and
hither
with
completest
disregard
of
whether
i
would
or
would
not
and
yet
when
i
found
myself
without
i
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
exultation
at
having
escaped
from
the
miasmic
atmosphere
of
that
room
of
unholy
memories
and
a
faint
hope
began
to
dawn
within
my
bosom
that
as
i
increased
the
distance
between
myself
and
it
i
might
shake
off
something
of
the
nightmare
helplessness
which
numbed
and
tortured
me
i
lingered
for
a
moment
by
the
window
then
stepped
over
the
short
dividing
wall
into
the
street
and
then
again
i
lingered
my
condition
was
one
of
dual
personality
while
physically
i
was
bound
mentally
to
a
considerable
extent
i
was
free
but
this
measure
of
freedom
on
my
mental
side
made
my
plight
no
better
for
among
other
things
i
realised
what
a
ridiculous
figure
i
must
be
cutting
barefooted
and
bareheaded
abroad
at
such
an
hour
of
the
night
in
such
a
boisterous
breeze
for
i
quickly
discovered
that
the
wind
amounted
to
something
like
a
gale
apart
from
all
other
considerations
the
notion
of
parading
the
streets
in
such
a
condition
filled
me
with
profound
disgust
and
i
do
believe
that
if
my
tyrannical
oppressor
had
only
permitted
me
to
attire
myself
in
my
own
garments
i
should
have
started
with
a
comparatively
light
heart
on
the
felonious
mission
on
which
he
apparently
was
sending
me
i
believe
too
that
the
consciousness
of
the
incongruity
of
my
attire
increased
my
sense
of
helplessness
and
that
had
i
been
dressed
as
englishmen
are
wont
to
be
who
take
their
walks
abroad
he
would
not
have
found
in
me
on
that
occasion
the
facile
instrument
which
in
fact
he
did
there
was
a
moment
in
which
the
gravelled
pathway
first
made
itself
known
to
my
naked
feet
and
the
cutting
wind
to
my
naked
flesh
when
i
think
it
possible
that
had
i
gritted
my
teeth
and
strained
my
every
nerve
i
might
have
shaken
myself
free
from
the
bonds
which
shackled
me
and
bade
defiance
to
the
ancient
sinner
who
for
all
i
knew
was
peeping
at
me
through
the
window
but
so
depressed
was
i
by
the
knowledge
of
the
ridiculous
appearance
i
presented
that
before
i
could
take
advantage
of
it
the
moment
passed
not
to
return
again
that
night
i
did
catch
as
it
were
at
its
fringe
as
it
was
flying
past
me
making
a
hurried
movement
to
one
side
the
first
i
had
made
of
my
own
initiative
for
hours
but
it
was
too
late
my
tormentor
as
if
though
unseen
he
saw
tightened
his
grip
i
was
whirled
round
and
sped
hastily
onwards
in
a
direction
in
which
i
certainly
had
no
desire
of
travelling
all
the
way
i
never
met
a
soul
i
have
since
wondered
whether
in
that
respect
my
experience
was
not
a
normal
one
whether
it
might
not
have
happened
to
any
if
so
there
are
streets
in
london
long
lines
of
streets
which
at
a
certain
period
of
the
night
in
a
certain
sort
of
weather
probably
the
weather
had
something
to
do
with
it
are
clean
deserted
in
which
there
is
neither
nor
vehicle
not
even
a
policeman
the
greater
part
of
the
route
along
which
i
was
driven
i
know
no
juster
word
was
one
with
which
i
had
some
sort
of
acquaintance
it
led
at
first
through
what
i
take
it
was
some
part
of
walham
green
then
along
the
lillie
road
through
brompton
across
the
fulham
road
through
the
network
of
streets
leading
to
sloane
street
across
sloane
street
into
lowndes
square
who
goes
that
way
goes
some
distance
and
goes
through
some
important
thorough
fares
yet
not
a
creature
did
i
see
nor
i
imagine
was
there
a
creature
who
saw
me
as
i
crossed
sloane
street
i
fancied
that
i
heard
the
distant
rumbling
of
a
vehicle
along
the
knightsbridge
road
but
that
was
the
only
sound
i
heard
it
is
painful
even
to
recollect
the
plight
in
which
i
was
when
i
was
stopped
for
stopped
i
was
as
shortly
and
as
sharply
as
the
beast
of
burden
with
a
bridle
in
its
mouth
whose
driver
puts
a
period
to
his
career
i
was
wet
intermittent
gusts
of
rain
were
borne
on
the
scurrying
wind
in
spite
of
the
pace
at
which
i
had
been
brought
i
was
chilled
to
the
bone
and
worst
of
all
my
feet
all
cut
and
bleeding
were
so
painful
for
unfortunately
i
was
still
susceptible
enough
to
pain
that
it
was
agony
to
have
them
come
into
contact
with
the
cold
and
the
slime
of
the
hard
unyielding
pavement
i
had
been
stopped
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
that
nearest
to
the
hospital
in
front
of
a
house
which
struck
me
as
being
somewhat
smaller
than
the
rest
it
was
a
house
with
a
portico
about
the
pillars
of
this
portico
was
trelliswork
and
on
the
trelliswork
was
trained
some
climbing
plant
as
i
stood
shivering
wondering
what
would
happen
next
some
strange
impulse
mastered
me
and
immediately
to
my
own
unbounded
amazement
i
found
myself
scrambling
up
the
trellis
towards
the
verandah
above
i
am
no
gymnast
either
by
nature
or
by
education
i
doubt
whether
previously
i
had
ever
attempted
to
climb
anything
more
difficult
than
a
step
ladder
the
result
was
that
though
the
impulse
might
be
given
me
the
skill
could
not
and
i
had
only
ascended
a
yard
or
so
when
losing
my
footing
i
came
slithering
down
upon
my
back
bruised
and
shaken
though
i
was
i
was
not
allowed
to
inquire
into
my
injuries
in
a
moment
i
was
on
my
feet
again
and
again
i
was
impelled
to
climb
only
however
again
to
come
to
grief
this
time
the
demon
or
whatever
it
was
that
had
entered
into
me
seeming
to
appreciate
the
impossibility
of
getting
me
to
the
top
of
that
verandah
directed
me
to
try
another
way
i
mounted
the
steps
leading
to
the
front
door
got
on
to
the
low
parapet
which
was
at
one
side
thence
on
to
the
sill
of
the
adjacent
window
had
i
slipped
then
i
should
have
fallen
a
sheer
descent
of
at
least
twenty
feet
to
the
bottom
of
the
deep
area
down
below
but
the
sill
was
broad
and
if
it
is
proper
to
use
such
language
in
connection
with
a
transaction
of
the
sort
in
which
i
was
engaged
fortune
favoured
me
i
did
not
fall
in
my
clenched
fist
i
had
a
stone
with
this
i
struck
the
pane
of
glass
as
with
a
hammer
through
the
hole
which
resulted
i
could
just
insert
my
hand
and
reach
the
latch
within
in
another
minute
the
sash
was
raised
and
i
was
in
the
house
i
had
committed
burglary
as
i
look
back
and
reflect
upon
the
audacity
of
the
whole
proceeding
even
now
i
tremble
hapless
slave
of
another
will
although
in
very
truth
i
was
i
can
not
repeat
too
often
that
i
realised
to
the
full
just
what
it
was
that
i
was
being
compelled
to
do
a
fact
which
was
very
far
from
rendering
my
situation
less
distressful
and
every
detail
of
my
involuntary
actions
was
projected
upon
my
brain
in
a
series
of
pictures
whose
outlines
so
long
as
memory
endures
will
never
fade
certainly
no
professional
burglar
nor
indeed
any
creature
in
his
senses
would
have
ventured
to
emulate
my
surprising
rashness
the
process
of
smashing
the
pane
of
glass
it
was
plate
glass
was
anything
but
a
noiseless
one
there
was
first
the
blow
itself
then
the
shivering
of
the
glass
then
the
clattering
of
fragments
into
the
area
beneath
one
would
have
thought
that
the
whole
thing
would
have
made
din
enough
to
have
roused
the
seven
sleepers
but
here
again
the
weather
was
on
my
side
about
that
time
the
wind
was
howling
wildly
it
came
shrieking
across
the
square
it
is
possible
that
the
tumult
which
it
made
deadened
all
other
sounds
anyhow
as
i
stood
within
the
room
which
i
had
violated
listening
for
signs
of
someone
being
on
the
alert
i
could
hear
nothing
within
the
house
there
seemed
to
be
the
silence
of
the
grave
i
drew
down
the
window
and
made
for
the
door
it
proved
by
no
means
easy
to
find
the
windows
were
obscured
by
heavy
curtains
so
that
the
room
inside
was
dark
as
pitch
it
appeared
to
be
unusually
full
of
furniture
an
appearance
due
perhaps
to
my
being
a
stranger
in
the
midst
of
such
cimmerian
blackness
i
had
to
feel
my
way
very
gingerly
indeed
among
the
various
impedimenta
as
it
was
i
seemed
to
come
into
contact
with
most
of
the
obstacles
there
were
to
come
into
contact
with
stumbling
more
than
once
over
footstools
and
over
what
seemed
to
be
dwarf
chairs
it
was
a
miracle
that
my
movements
still
continued
to
be
unheard
but
i
believe
that
the
explanation
was
that
the
house
was
well
built
that
the
servants
were
the
only
persons
in
it
at
the
time
that
their
bedrooms
were
on
the
top
floor
that
they
were
fast
asleep
and
that
they
were
little
likely
to
be
disturbed
by
anything
that
might
occur
in
the
room
which
i
had
entered
reaching
the
door
at
last
i
opened
it
listening
for
any
promise
of
being
interrupted
and
to
adapt
a
hackneyed
phrase
directed
by
the
power
which
shaped
my
end
i
went
across
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
i
passed
up
the
first
landing
and
on
the
second
moved
to
a
door
upon
the
right
i
turned
the
handle
it
yielded
the
door
opened
i
entered
closing
it
behind
me
i
went
to
the
wall
just
inside
the
door
found
a
handle
jerked
it
and
switched
on
the
electric
light
doing
i
make
no
doubt
all
these
things
from
a
spectator
point
of
view
so
naturally
that
a
judge
and
jury
would
have
been
with
difficulty
persuaded
that
they
were
not
the
product
of
my
own
volition
in
the
brilliant
glow
of
the
electric
light
i
took
a
leisurely
survey
of
the
contents
of
the
room
it
was
as
the
man
in
the
bed
had
said
it
would
be
a
study
a
fine
spacious
apartment
evidently
intended
rather
for
work
than
for
show
there
were
three
separate
one
very
large
and
two
smaller
ones
all
covered
with
an
orderly
array
of
manuscripts
and
papers
a
typewriter
stood
at
the
side
of
one
on
the
floor
under
and
about
them
were
piles
of
books
portfolios
and
documents
every
available
foot
of
wall
space
on
three
sides
of
the
room
was
lined
with
shelves
full
as
they
could
hold
with
books
on
the
fourth
side
facing
the
door
was
a
large
oak
bookcase
and
in
the
farther
corner
a
quaint
old
bureau
so
soon
as
i
saw
this
bureau
i
went
for
it
straight
as
an
arrow
from
a
bow
indeed
it
would
be
no
abuse
of
metaphor
to
say
that
i
was
propelled
towards
it
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
it
had
drawers
below
glass
doors
above
and
between
the
drawers
and
the
doors
was
a
flap
to
let
down
it
was
to
this
flap
my
attention
was
directed
i
put
out
my
hand
to
open
it
it
was
locked
at
the
top
i
pulled
at
it
with
both
hands
it
refused
to
budge
so
this
was
the
lock
i
was
if
necessary
to
practise
the
arts
of
a
thief
to
open
i
was
no
picklock
i
had
flattered
myself
that
nothing
and
no
one
could
make
me
such
a
thing
yet
now
that
i
found
myself
confronted
by
that
unyielding
flap
i
found
that
pressure
irresistible
pressure
was
being
put
upon
me
to
gain
by
any
and
every
means
access
to
its
interior
i
had
no
option
but
to
yield
i
looked
about
me
in
search
of
some
convenient
tool
with
which
to
ply
the
felon
trade
i
found
it
close
beside
me
leaning
against
the
wall
within
a
yard
of
where
i
stood
were
examples
of
various
kinds
of
weapons
among
them
taking
one
of
these
with
much
difficulty
i
forced
the
point
between
the
flap
and
the
bureau
using
the
leverage
thus
obtained
i
attempted
to
prise
it
open
the
flap
held
fast
the
snapped
in
two
i
tried
another
with
the
same
result
a
third
to
fail
again
there
were
no
more
the
most
convenient
thing
remaining
was
a
queer
hatchet
this
i
took
brought
the
sharp
edge
down
with
all
my
force
upon
the
refractory
flap
the
hatchet
went
through
before
i
had
done
with
it
it
was
open
with
a
vengeance
but
i
was
destined
on
the
occasion
of
my
first
and
i
trust
last
experience
of
the
burglar
calling
to
carry
the
part
completely
through
i
had
gained
access
to
the
flap
itself
only
to
find
that
at
the
back
were
several
small
drawers
on
one
of
which
my
observation
was
brought
to
bear
in
a
fashion
which
it
was
quite
impossible
to
disregard
as
a
matter
of
course
it
was
locked
and
once
more
i
had
to
search
for
something
which
would
serve
as
a
substitute
for
the
missing
key
there
was
nothing
at
all
suitable
among
the
weapons
i
could
hardly
for
such
a
purpose
use
the
hatchet
the
drawer
in
question
was
such
a
little
one
that
to
have
done
so
would
have
been
to
shiver
it
to
splinters
on
the
mantelshelf
in
an
open
leather
case
were
a
pair
of
revolvers
statesmen
nowadays
sometimes
stand
in
actual
peril
of
their
lives
it
is
possible
that
mr
lessingham
conscious
of
continually
threatened
danger
carried
them
about
with
him
as
a
necessary
protection
they
were
serviceable
weapons
large
and
somewhat
weighty
of
the
type
with
which
i
believe
upon
occasion
the
police
are
armed
not
only
were
all
the
barrels
loaded
but
in
the
case
itself
there
was
a
supply
of
cartridges
more
than
sufficient
to
charge
them
all
again
i
was
handling
the
weapons
wondering
if
in
my
condition
the
word
was
applicable
what
use
i
could
make
of
them
to
enable
me
to
gain
admission
to
that
drawer
when
there
came
on
a
sudden
from
the
street
without
the
sound
of
approaching
wheels
there
was
a
whirring
within
my
brain
as
if
someone
was
endeavouring
to
explain
to
me
to
what
service
to
apply
the
revolvers
and
i
perforce
strained
every
nerve
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
my
invisible
mentor
while
i
did
so
the
wheels
drew
rapidly
nearer
and
just
as
i
was
expecting
them
to
go
whirling
by
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
my
heart
leapt
in
my
bosom
in
a
convulsion
of
frantic
terror
again
during
the
passage
of
one
frenzied
moment
i
all
but
burst
the
bonds
that
held
me
and
fled
haphazard
from
the
imminent
peril
but
the
bonds
were
stronger
than
i
it
was
as
if
i
had
been
rooted
to
the
ground
a
key
was
inserted
in
the
keyhole
of
the
front
door
the
lock
was
turned
the
door
thrown
open
firm
footsteps
entered
the
house
if
i
could
i
would
not
have
stood
upon
the
order
of
my
going
but
gone
at
once
anywhere
anyhow
but
at
that
moment
my
comings
and
goings
were
not
matters
in
which
i
was
consulted
panic
fear
raging
within
outwardly
i
was
calm
as
possible
and
stood
turning
the
revolvers
over
and
over
asking
myself
what
it
could
be
that
i
was
intended
to
do
with
them
all
at
once
it
came
to
me
in
an
illuminating
flash
i
was
to
fire
at
the
lock
of
the
drawer
and
blow
it
open
a
madder
scheme
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
hit
upon
the
servants
had
slept
through
a
good
deal
but
they
would
hardly
sleep
through
the
discharge
of
a
revolver
in
a
room
below
them
not
to
speak
of
the
person
who
had
just
entered
the
premises
and
whose
footsteps
were
already
audible
as
he
came
up
the
stairs
i
struggled
to
make
a
dumb
protest
against
the
insensate
folly
which
was
hurrying
me
to
infallible
destruction
without
success
for
me
there
was
only
obedience
with
a
revolver
in
either
hand
i
marched
towards
the
bureau
as
unconcernedly
as
if
i
would
not
have
given
my
life
to
have
escaped
the
denouement
which
i
needed
but
a
slight
modicum
of
common
sense
to
be
aware
was
close
at
hand
i
placed
the
muzzle
of
one
of
the
revolvers
against
the
keyhole
of
the
drawer
to
which
my
unseen
guide
had
previously
directed
me
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
lock
was
shattered
the
contents
of
the
drawer
were
at
my
mercy
i
snatched
up
a
bundle
of
letters
about
which
a
pink
ribbon
was
wrapped
startled
by
a
noise
behind
me
immediately
following
the
report
of
the
pistol
i
glanced
over
my
shoulder
the
room
door
was
open
and
mr
lessingham
was
standing
with
the
handle
in
his
hand
chapter
vii
the
great
paul
lessingham
he
was
in
evening
dress
he
carried
a
small
portfolio
in
his
left
hand
if
the
discovery
of
my
presence
startled
him
as
it
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
do
he
allowed
no
sign
of
surprise
to
escape
him
paul
lessingham
impenetrability
is
proverbial
whether
on
platforms
addressing
excited
crowds
or
in
the
midst
of
heated
discussion
in
the
house
of
commons
all
the
world
knows
that
his
coolness
remains
unruffled
it
is
generally
understood
that
he
owes
his
success
in
the
political
arena
in
no
slight
measure
to
the
adroitness
which
is
born
of
his
invulnerable
presence
of
mind
he
gave
me
a
taste
of
its
quality
then
standing
in
the
attitude
which
has
been
familiarised
to
us
by
caricaturists
his
feet
apart
his
broad
shoulders
well
set
back
his
handsome
head
a
little
advanced
his
keen
blue
eyes
having
in
them
something
suggestive
of
a
bird
of
prey
considering
just
when
where
and
how
to
pounce
he
regarded
me
for
some
seconds
in
perfect
silence
whether
outwardly
i
flinched
i
can
not
say
inwardly
i
know
i
did
when
he
spoke
it
was
without
moving
from
where
he
stood
and
in
the
calm
airy
tones
in
which
he
might
have
addressed
an
acquaintance
who
had
just
dropped
in
i
ask
sir
to
what
i
am
indebted
for
the
pleasure
of
your
company
he
paused
as
if
waiting
for
my
answer
when
none
came
he
put
his
question
in
another
form
sir
who
are
you
and
on
whose
invitation
do
i
find
you
here
as
i
still
stood
speechless
motionless
meeting
his
glance
without
a
twitching
of
an
eyebrow
nor
a
tremor
of
the
hand
i
imagine
that
he
began
to
consider
me
with
an
even
closer
intentness
than
before
and
that
the
to
say
the
least
of
it
peculiarity
of
my
appearance
caused
him
to
suspect
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
an
adventure
of
a
peculiar
kind
whether
he
took
me
for
a
lunatic
i
can
not
certainly
say
but
from
his
manner
i
think
it
possible
he
did
he
began
to
move
towards
me
from
across
the
room
addressing
me
with
the
utmost
suavity
and
courtesy
so
good
as
to
give
me
the
revolver
and
the
papers
you
are
holding
in
your
hand
as
he
came
on
something
entered
into
me
and
forced
itself
from
between
my
lips
so
that
i
said
in
a
low
hissing
voice
which
i
vow
was
never
mine
beetle
whether
it
was
or
was
not
owing
in
some
degree
to
a
trick
of
my
imagination
i
can
not
determine
but
as
the
words
were
spoken
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
lights
went
low
so
that
the
place
was
all
in
darkness
and
i
again
was
filled
with
the
nauseous
consciousness
of
the
presence
of
something
evil
in
the
room
but
if
in
that
matter
my
abnormally
strained
imagination
played
me
a
trick
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
the
effect
which
the
words
had
on
mr
lessingham
when
the
mist
of
the
blackness
real
or
supposititious
had
passed
from
before
my
eyes
i
found
that
he
had
retreated
to
the
extremest
limits
of
the
room
and
was
crouching
his
back
against
the
bookshelves
clutching
at
them
in
the
attitude
of
a
man
who
has
received
a
staggering
blow
from
which
as
yet
he
has
had
no
opportunity
of
recovering
a
most
extraordinary
change
had
taken
place
in
the
expression
of
his
face
in
his
countenance
amazement
fear
and
horror
seemed
struggling
for
the
mastery
i
was
filled
with
a
most
discomforting
qualm
as
i
gazed
at
the
frightened
figure
in
front
of
me
and
realised
that
it
was
that
of
the
great
paul
lessingham
the
god
of
my
political
idolatry
are
you
in
god
name
who
are
you
his
very
voice
seemed
changed
his
frenzied
choking
accents
would
hardly
have
been
recognised
by
either
friend
or
foe
are
you
do
you
hear
me
ask
who
are
you
in
the
name
of
god
i
bid
you
say
as
he
perceived
that
i
was
still
he
began
to
show
a
species
of
excitement
which
it
was
unpleasant
to
witness
especially
as
he
continued
to
crouch
against
the
bookshelf
as
if
he
was
afraid
to
stand
up
straight
so
far
from
exhibiting
the
impassivity
for
which
he
was
renowned
all
the
muscles
in
his
face
and
all
the
limbs
in
his
body
seemed
to
be
in
motion
at
once
he
was
like
a
man
afflicted
with
the
shivering
ague
his
very
fingers
were
twitching
aimlessly
as
they
were
stretched
out
on
either
side
of
him
as
if
seeking
for
support
from
the
shelves
against
which
he
leaned
have
you
come
from
what
do
you
want
who
sent
you
here
what
concern
have
you
with
me
is
it
necessary
that
you
should
come
and
play
these
childish
tricks
with
me
why
why
the
questions
came
from
him
with
astonishing
rapidity
when
he
saw
that
i
continued
silent
they
came
still
faster
mingled
with
what
sounded
to
me
like
a
stream
of
inchoate
abuse
do
you
stand
there
in
that
extraordinary
garment
it
worse
than
nakedness
yes
worse
than
nakedness
for
that
alone
i
could
have
you
punished
and
i
will
and
try
to
play
the
fool
do
you
think
i
am
a
boy
to
be
bamboozled
by
every
bogey
a
blunderer
may
try
to
conjure
up
if
so
you
wrong
as
whoever
sent
you
might
have
had
sense
enough
to
let
you
know
if
you
tell
me
who
you
are
and
who
sent
you
here
and
what
it
is
you
want
i
will
be
merciful
if
not
the
police
shall
be
sent
for
and
the
law
shall
take
its
course
to
the
bitter
end
i
warn
do
you
hear
you
fool
tell
me
who
you
are
the
last
words
came
from
him
in
what
was
very
like
a
burst
of
childish
fury
he
himself
seemed
conscious
the
moment
after
that
his
passion
was
sadly
lacking
in
dignity
and
to
be
ashamed
of
it
he
drew
himself
straight
up
with
a
which
he
took
from
an
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
he
wiped
his
lips
then
clutching
it
tightly
in
his
hand
he
eyed
me
with
a
fixedness
which
under
any
other
circumstances
i
should
have
found
unbearable
sir
is
your
continued
silence
part
of
the
business
of
the
role
you
have
set
yourself
to
play
his
tone
was
firmer
and
his
bearing
more
in
keeping
with
his
character
it
be
so
i
presume
that
i
at
least
have
liberty
to
speak
when
i
find
a
gentleman
even
one
gifted
with
your
eloquence
of
silence
playing
the
part
of
burglar
i
think
you
will
grant
that
a
few
words
on
my
part
can
not
justly
be
considered
to
be
out
of
place
again
he
paused
i
could
not
but
feel
that
he
was
employing
the
vehicle
of
somewhat
cumbrous
sarcasm
to
gain
time
and
to
give
himself
the
opportunity
of
recovering
if
the
thing
was
possible
his
pristine
courage
that
for
some
cause
wholly
hidden
from
me
the
mysterious
utterance
had
shaken
his
nature
to
its
deepest
foundations
was
made
plainer
by
his
endeavour
to
treat
the
whole
business
with
a
sort
of
cynical
levity
commence
with
may
i
ask
if
you
have
come
through
london
or
through
any
portion
of
it
in
that
costume
or
rather
in
that
want
of
costume
it
would
seem
out
of
place
in
a
cairene
street
would
it
not
even
in
the
rue
de
rabagas
was
it
not
the
rue
de
rabagas
he
asked
the
question
with
an
emphasis
the
meaning
of
which
was
wholly
lost
on
me
what
he
referred
to
either
then
or
in
what
immediately
followed
i
of
course
knew
no
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
though
i
should
probably
have
found
great
difficulty
in
convincing
him
of
my
ignorance
take
it
that
you
are
a
reminiscence
of
the
rue
de
rabagas
that
of
course
is
it
not
of
course
the
little
house
with
the
venetians
and
the
piano
with
the
f
sharp
missing
is
there
still
the
piano
with
the
tinny
treble
indeed
the
whole
atmosphere
was
it
not
tinny
you
agree
with
me
i
have
not
forgotten
i
am
not
even
afraid
to
remember
you
perceive
it
a
new
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
born
perhaps
of
my
continued
silence
look
english
is
it
possible
that
you
are
not
english
what
are
you
then
french
we
shall
see
he
addressed
me
in
a
tongue
which
i
recognised
as
french
but
with
which
i
was
not
sufficiently
acquainted
to
understand
although
i
flatter
myself
that
as
the
present
narrative
should
show
i
have
not
made
an
of
the
opportunities
which
i
have
had
to
improve
my
originally
modest
education
i
regret
that
i
have
never
had
so
much
as
a
ghost
of
a
chance
to
acquire
an
even
rudimentary
knowledge
of
any
language
except
my
own
recognising
i
suppose
from
my
looks
that
he
was
addressing
me
in
a
tongue
to
which
i
was
a
stranger
after
a
time
he
stopped
added
something
with
a
smile
and
then
began
to
talk
to
me
in
a
lingo
to
which
in
a
manner
of
speaking
i
was
even
stranger
for
this
time
i
had
not
the
faintest
notion
what
it
was
it
might
have
been
gibberish
for
all
that
i
could
tell
quickly
perceiving
that
he
had
succeeded
no
better
than
before
he
returned
to
english
do
not
know
french
nor
the
patois
of
the
rue
de
rabagas
very
good
then
what
is
it
that
you
do
know
are
you
under
a
vow
of
silence
or
are
you
dumb
except
upon
occasion
your
face
is
english
what
can
be
seen
of
it
and
i
will
take
it
therefore
that
english
spoken
words
convey
some
meaning
to
your
brain
so
listen
sir
to
what
i
have
to
say
do
me
the
favour
to
listen
carefully
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
his
former
self
in
his
clear
modulated
tones
there
was
a
ring
of
something
like
a
threat
a
something
which
went
very
far
beyond
his
words
know
something
of
a
period
which
i
choose
to
have
forgotten
that
is
plain
you
come
from
a
person
who
probably
knows
still
more
go
back
to
that
person
and
say
that
what
i
have
forgotten
i
have
forgotten
nothing
will
be
gained
by
anyone
by
an
endeavour
to
induce
me
to
remember
be
very
sure
upon
that
point
say
that
nothing
will
be
gained
by
anyone
that
time
was
one
of
mirage
of
delusion
of
disease
i
was
in
a
condition
mentally
and
bodily
in
which
pranks
could
have
been
played
upon
me
by
any
trickster
such
pranks
were
played
i
know
that
now
quite
well
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
proficient
in
the
modus
operandi
of
the
man
but
i
know
that
he
has
a
method
all
the
same
one
susceptible
too
of
facile
explanation
go
back
to
your
friend
and
tell
him
that
i
am
not
again
likely
to
be
made
the
butt
of
his
old
method
nor
of
his
new
one
you
hear
me
sir
i
remained
motionless
and
silent
an
attitude
which
plainly
he
resented
you
deaf
and
dumb
you
certainly
are
not
dumb
for
you
spoke
to
me
just
now
be
advised
by
me
and
do
not
compel
me
to
resort
to
measures
which
will
be
the
cause
to
you
of
serious
you
hear
me
sir
still
from
me
not
a
sign
of
comprehension
to
his
increased
annoyance
be
it
keep
your
own
counsel
if
you
choose
yours
will
be
the
bitterness
not
mine
you
may
play
the
lunatic
and
play
it
excellently
well
but
that
you
do
understand
what
is
said
to
you
is
come
to
business
sir
give
me
that
revolver
and
the
packet
of
letters
which
you
have
stolen
from
my
desk
he
had
been
speaking
with
the
air
of
one
who
desired
to
convince
himself
as
much
as
me
and
about
his
last
words
there
was
almost
a
flavour
of
braggadocio
i
remained
unheeding
you
going
to
do
as
i
require
or
are
you
insane
enough
to
refuse
in
which
case
i
shall
summon
assistance
and
there
will
quickly
be
an
end
of
it
pray
do
not
imagine
that
you
can
trick
me
into
supposing
that
you
do
not
grasp
the
situation
i
know
once
more
are
you
going
to
give
me
that
revolver
and
those
letters
yet
no
reply
his
anger
was
growing
momentarily
greater
and
his
agitation
too
on
my
first
introduction
to
paul
lessingham
i
was
not
destined
to
discover
in
him
any
one
of
those
qualities
of
which
the
world
held
him
to
be
the
undisputed
possessor
he
showed
himself
to
be
as
unlike
the
statesman
i
had
conceived
and
esteemed
as
he
easily
could
have
done
you
think
i
stand
in
awe
of
you
you
of
such
a
thing
as
you
do
as
i
tell
you
or
i
myself
will
make
you
and
at
the
same
time
teach
you
a
lesson
he
raised
his
voice
in
his
bearing
there
was
a
defiance
he
might
not
have
been
aware
of
it
but
the
repetitions
of
the
threats
were
in
themselves
confessions
of
weakness
he
came
a
step
or
two
forward
then
stopping
short
began
to
tremble
the
perspiration
broke
out
upon
his
brow
he
made
spasmodic
little
dabs
at
it
with
his
handkerchief
his
eyes
wandered
hither
and
thither
as
if
searching
for
something
which
they
feared
to
see
yet
were
constrained
to
seek
he
began
to
talk
to
himself
out
loud
in
odd
disconnected
sentences
apparently
ignoring
me
entirely
was
that
it
was
it
was
my
my
nerves
are
out
of
i
have
been
working
too
i
am
not
that
this
last
inquiry
came
from
him
in
a
shriek
as
the
door
opened
to
admit
the
head
and
body
of
an
elderly
man
in
a
state
of
considerable
undress
he
had
the
tousled
appearance
of
one
who
had
been
unexpectedly
roused
out
of
slumber
and
unwillingly
dragged
from
bed
mr
lessingham
stared
at
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
ghost
while
he
stared
back
at
mr
lessingham
as
if
he
found
a
difficulty
in
crediting
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
it
was
he
who
broke
the
silence
stutteringly
am
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
one
of
the
maids
thought
that
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
shot
and
we
came
down
to
see
if
there
was
anything
the
matter
i
had
no
idea
sir
that
you
were
here
his
eyes
travelled
from
mr
lessingham
towards
me
suddenly
increasing
when
they
saw
me
to
about
twice
their
previous
size
save
us
who
is
that
the
man
cowardice
possibly
impressed
mr
lessingham
with
the
conviction
that
he
himself
was
not
cutting
the
most
dignified
of
figures
at
any
rate
he
made
a
notable
effort
to
once
more
assume
a
bearing
of
greater
determination
are
quite
right
matthews
quite
right
i
am
obliged
by
your
watchfulness
at
present
you
may
leave
the
room
i
propose
to
deal
with
this
fellow
myself
only
remain
with
the
other
men
upon
the
landing
so
that
if
i
call
you
may
come
to
my
assistance
matthews
did
as
he
was
told
he
left
the
room
with
i
fancy
more
rapidity
than
he
had
entered
it
mr
lessingham
returned
to
me
his
manner
distinctly
more
determined
as
if
he
found
his
resolution
reinforced
by
the
near
neighbourhood
of
his
retainers
my
man
you
see
how
the
case
stands
at
a
word
from
me
you
will
be
overpowered
and
doomed
to
undergo
a
long
period
of
imprisonment
yet
i
am
still
willing
to
listen
to
the
dictates
of
mercy
put
down
that
revolver
give
me
those
letters
you
will
not
find
me
disposed
to
treat
you
hardly
for
all
the
attention
i
paid
him
i
might
have
been
a
graven
image
he
misunderstood
or
pretended
to
misunderstand
the
cause
of
my
silence
i
see
that
you
suppose
my
intentions
to
be
harsher
than
they
really
are
do
not
let
us
have
a
scandal
and
a
scene
be
sensible
give
me
those
letters
again
he
moved
in
my
direction
again
after
he
had
taken
a
step
or
two
to
stumble
and
stop
and
look
about
him
with
frightened
eyes
again
to
begin
to
mumble
to
himself
aloud
a
conjurer
trick
of
course
nothing
more
what
else
could
it
be
i
not
to
be
i
older
than
i
was
i
been
overdoing
it
that
all
suddenly
he
broke
into
cries
matthews
help
help
matthews
entered
the
room
followed
by
three
other
men
younger
than
himself
evidently
all
had
slipped
into
the
first
articles
of
clothing
they
could
lay
their
hands
upon
and
each
carried
a
stick
or
some
similar
rudimentary
weapon
their
master
spurred
them
on
the
revolver
out
of
his
hand
matthews
knock
him
down
take
the
letters
from
him
do
be
afraid
i
not
afraid
in
proof
of
it
he
rushed
at
me
as
it
seemed
half
blindly
as
he
did
so
i
was
constrained
to
shout
out
in
tones
which
i
should
not
have
recognised
as
mine
beetle
and
that
moment
the
room
was
all
in
darkness
and
there
were
screams
as
of
someone
in
an
agony
of
terror
or
of
pain
i
felt
that
something
had
come
into
the
room
i
knew
not
whence
nor
how
something
of
horror
and
the
next
action
of
which
i
was
conscious
was
that
under
cover
of
the
darkness
i
was
flying
from
the
room
propelled
by
i
knew
not
what
chapter
viii
the
man
in
the
street
whether
anyone
pursued
i
can
not
say
i
have
some
dim
recollection
as
i
came
out
of
the
room
of
women
being
huddled
against
the
wall
upon
the
landing
and
of
their
screaming
as
i
went
past
but
whether
any
effort
was
made
to
arrest
my
progress
i
can
not
tell
my
own
impression
is
that
not
the
slightest
attempt
to
impede
my
headlong
flight
was
made
by
anyone
in
what
direction
i
was
going
i
did
not
know
i
was
like
a
man
flying
through
the
phantasmagoric
happenings
of
a
dream
knowing
neither
how
nor
whither
i
tore
along
what
i
suppose
was
a
broad
passage
through
a
door
at
the
end
into
what
i
fancy
was
a
across
this
room
i
dashed
bringing
down
in
the
gloom
unseen
articles
of
furniture
with
myself
sometimes
on
top
and
sometimes
under
them
in
a
trice
each
time
i
fell
i
was
on
my
feet
again
until
i
went
crashing
against
a
window
which
was
concealed
by
curtains
it
would
not
have
been
strange
had
i
crashed
through
it
but
i
was
spared
that
thrusting
aside
the
curtains
i
fumbled
for
the
fastening
of
the
window
it
was
a
tall
french
casement
extending
so
far
as
i
could
judge
from
floor
to
ceiling
when
i
had
it
open
i
stepped
through
it
on
to
the
verandah
without
to
find
that
i
was
on
the
top
of
the
portico
which
i
had
vainly
essayed
to
ascend
from
below
i
tried
the
road
down
which
i
had
tried
up
proceeding
with
a
breakneck
recklessness
of
which
now
i
shudder
to
think
it
was
probably
some
thirty
feet
above
the
pavement
yet
i
rushed
at
the
descent
with
as
much
disregard
for
the
safety
of
life
and
limb
as
if
it
had
been
only
three
over
the
edge
of
the
parapet
i
went
obtaining
with
my
naked
feet
a
precarious
foothold
on
the
latticework
then
down
i
commenced
to
scramble
i
never
did
get
a
proper
hold
and
when
i
had
descended
perhaps
rather
more
than
half
the
distance
scraping
as
it
seemed
to
me
every
scrap
of
skin
off
my
body
in
the
process
i
lost
what
little
hold
i
had
down
to
the
bottom
i
went
tumbling
rolling
right
across
the
pavement
into
the
muddy
road
it
was
a
miracle
i
was
not
seriously
injured
but
in
that
sense
certainly
that
night
the
miracles
were
on
my
side
hardly
was
i
down
than
i
was
up
again
mud
and
all
just
as
i
was
getting
on
to
my
feet
i
felt
a
firm
hand
grip
me
by
the
shoulder
turning
i
found
myself
confronted
by
a
tall
slenderly
built
man
with
a
long
drooping
moustache
and
an
overcoat
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
who
held
me
with
a
grasp
of
steel
he
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
back
at
him
the
ball
eh
even
then
i
was
struck
by
something
pleasant
in
his
voice
and
some
quality
as
of
sunshine
in
his
handsome
face
seeing
that
i
said
nothing
he
went
on
with
a
curious
half
mocking
smile
that
the
way
to
come
slithering
down
the
apostle
pillar
is
it
simple
burglary
or
simpler
murder
tell
me
the
glad
tidings
that
you
killed
st
paul
and
i
let
you
go
whether
he
was
mad
or
not
i
can
not
say
there
was
some
excuse
for
thinking
so
he
did
not
look
mad
though
his
words
and
actions
alike
were
strange
you
have
confined
yourself
to
gentle
felony
shall
i
not
shower
blessings
on
the
head
of
him
who
has
been
robbing
paul
away
with
you
he
removed
his
grip
giving
me
a
gentle
push
as
he
did
so
and
i
was
away
i
neither
stayed
nor
paused
i
knew
little
of
records
but
if
anyone
has
made
a
better
record
than
i
did
that
night
between
lowndes
square
and
walham
green
i
should
like
to
know
just
what
it
was
i
should
too
like
to
have
seen
it
done
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
i
was
once
more
in
front
of
the
house
with
the
open
window
the
packet
of
letters
which
were
like
to
have
cost
me
so
dear
gripped
tightly
in
my
hand
chapter
ix
the
contents
of
the
packet
i
pulled
up
sharply
as
if
a
brake
had
been
suddenly
and
even
mercilessly
applied
to
bring
me
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
the
window
i
stood
shivering
a
shower
had
recently
commenced
the
falling
rain
was
being
blown
before
the
breeze
i
was
in
a
terrible
sweat
yet
tremulous
as
with
cold
covered
with
mud
bruised
and
cut
and
bleeding
as
piteous
an
object
as
you
would
care
to
see
every
limb
in
my
body
ached
every
muscle
was
exhausted
mentally
and
physically
i
was
done
had
i
not
been
held
up
willy
nilly
by
the
spell
which
was
upon
me
i
should
have
sunk
down
then
and
there
in
a
hopeless
helpless
hapless
heap
but
my
tormentor
was
not
yet
at
an
end
with
me
as
i
stood
there
like
some
broken
and
beaten
hack
waiting
for
the
word
of
command
it
came
it
was
as
if
some
strong
magnetic
current
had
been
switched
on
to
me
through
the
window
to
draw
me
into
the
room
over
the
low
wall
i
went
over
the
sill
once
more
i
stood
in
that
chamber
of
my
humiliation
and
my
shame
and
once
again
i
was
conscious
of
that
awful
sense
of
the
presence
of
an
evil
thing
how
much
of
it
was
fact
and
how
much
of
it
was
the
product
of
imagination
i
can
not
say
but
looking
back
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
as
if
i
had
been
taken
out
of
the
corporeal
body
to
be
plunged
into
the
inner
chambers
of
all
nameless
sin
there
was
the
sound
of
something
flopping
from
off
the
bed
on
to
the
ground
and
i
knew
that
the
thing
was
coming
at
me
across
the
floor
my
stomach
quaked
my
heart
melted
within
me
the
very
anguish
of
my
terror
gave
me
strength
to
scream
and
scream
sometimes
even
now
i
seem
to
hear
those
screams
of
mine
ringing
through
the
night
and
i
bury
my
face
in
the
pillow
and
it
is
as
though
i
was
passing
through
the
very
valley
of
the
shadow
the
thing
went
back
i
could
hear
it
slipping
and
sliding
across
the
floor
there
was
silence
and
presently
the
lamp
was
lit
and
the
room
was
all
in
brightness
there
on
the
bed
in
the
familiar
attitude
between
the
sheets
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
his
eyes
blazing
like
living
coals
was
the
dreadful
cause
of
all
my
agonies
he
looked
at
me
with
his
unpitying
unblinking
glance
through
the
window
again
like
a
thief
is
it
always
through
that
door
that
you
come
into
a
house
he
paused
as
if
to
give
me
time
to
digest
his
gibe
saw
paul
lessingham
well
the
great
paul
lessingham
was
he
then
so
great
his
rasping
voice
with
its
queer
foreign
twang
reminded
me
in
some
uncomfortable
way
of
a
rusty
saw
the
things
he
said
and
the
manner
in
which
he
said
them
were
alike
intended
to
add
to
my
discomfort
it
was
solely
because
the
feat
was
barely
possible
that
he
only
partially
succeeded
a
thief
you
went
into
his
house
did
i
not
tell
you
that
you
would
like
a
thief
he
found
you
were
you
not
ashamed
since
like
a
thief
he
found
you
how
comes
it
that
you
have
escaped
by
what
robber
artifice
have
you
saved
yourself
from
gaol
his
manner
changed
so
that
all
at
once
he
seemed
to
snarl
at
me
he
great
well
is
he
great
paul
lessingham
you
are
small
but
he
is
smaller
your
great
paul
lessingham
was
there
ever
a
man
so
less
than
nothing
with
the
recollection
fresh
upon
me
of
mr
lessingham
as
i
had
so
lately
seen
him
i
could
not
but
feel
that
there
might
be
a
modicum
of
truth
in
what
with
such
an
intensity
of
bitterness
the
speaker
suggested
the
picture
which
in
my
mental
gallery
i
had
hung
in
the
place
of
honour
seemed
to
say
the
least
to
have
become
a
trifle
smudged
as
usual
the
man
in
the
bed
seemed
to
experience
not
the
slightest
difficulty
in
deciphering
what
was
passing
through
my
mind
is
so
you
and
he
you
are
a
pair
the
great
paul
lessingham
is
as
great
a
thief
as
you
and
greater
for
at
least
than
you
he
has
more
courage
for
some
moments
he
was
still
then
exclaimed
with
sudden
fierceness
me
what
you
have
stolen
i
moved
towards
the
bed
most
unwillingly
and
held
out
to
him
the
packet
of
letters
which
i
had
abstracted
from
the
little
drawer
perceiving
my
disinclination
to
his
near
neighbourhood
he
set
himself
to
play
with
it
ignoring
my
outstretched
hand
he
stared
me
straight
in
the
face
ails
you
are
you
not
well
is
it
not
sweet
to
stand
close
at
my
side
you
with
your
white
skin
if
i
were
a
woman
would
you
not
take
me
for
a
wife
there
was
something
about
the
manner
in
which
this
was
said
which
was
so
essentially
feminine
that
once
more
i
wondered
if
i
could
possibly
be
mistaken
in
the
creature
sex
i
would
have
given
much
to
have
been
able
to
strike
him
across
the
face
or
better
to
have
taken
him
by
the
neck
and
thrown
him
through
the
window
and
rolled
him
in
the
mud
he
condescended
to
notice
what
i
was
holding
out
to
him
that
is
what
you
have
stolen
that
is
what
you
have
taken
from
the
drawer
in
the
bureau
the
drawer
which
was
locked
and
which
you
used
the
arts
in
which
a
thief
is
skilled
to
enter
give
it
to
me
thief
he
snatched
the
packet
from
me
scratching
the
back
of
my
hand
as
he
did
so
as
if
his
nails
had
been
talons
he
turned
the
packet
over
and
over
glaring
at
it
as
he
did
so
it
was
strange
what
a
relief
it
was
to
have
his
glance
removed
from
off
my
face
kept
it
in
your
inner
drawer
paul
lessingham
where
none
but
you
could
see
it
did
you
you
hid
it
as
one
hides
treasure
there
should
be
something
here
worth
having
worth
seeing
worth
knowing
yes
worth
knowing
since
you
found
it
worth
your
while
to
hide
it
up
so
closely
as
i
have
said
the
packet
was
bound
about
by
a
string
of
pink
ribbon
a
fact
on
which
he
presently
began
to
comment
what
a
pretty
string
you
have
encircled
it
and
how
neatly
it
is
tied
surely
only
a
woman
hand
could
tie
a
knot
like
that
who
would
have
guessed
yours
were
such
agile
fingers
so
an
endorsement
on
the
cover
what
this
let
see
what
written
the
letters
of
my
dear
love
marjorie
lindon
as
he
read
these
words
which
as
he
said
were
endorsed
upon
the
outer
sheet
of
paper
which
served
as
a
cover
for
the
letters
which
were
enclosed
within
his
face
became
transfigured
never
did
i
suppose
that
rage
could
have
so
possessed
a
human
countenance
his
jaw
dropped
open
so
that
his
yellow
fangs
gleamed
though
his
parted
lips
he
held
his
breath
so
long
that
each
moment
i
looked
to
see
him
fall
down
in
a
fit
the
veins
stood
out
all
over
his
face
and
head
like
seams
of
blood
i
know
not
how
long
he
continued
speechless
when
his
breath
returned
it
was
with
chokings
and
gaspings
in
the
midst
of
which
he
hissed
out
his
words
as
if
their
mere
passage
through
his
throat
brought
him
near
to
strangulation
letters
of
his
dear
love
of
his
dear
love
his
paul
lessingham
so
it
is
as
i
guessed
as
i
knew
as
i
saw
marjorie
lindon
sweet
marjorie
his
dear
love
paul
lessingham
dear
love
she
with
the
lily
face
the
hair
what
is
it
his
dear
love
has
found
in
her
fond
heart
to
write
paul
lessingham
sitting
up
in
bed
he
tore
the
packet
open
it
contained
perhaps
eight
or
nine
letters
some
mere
notes
some
long
epistles
but
short
or
long
he
devoured
them
with
equal
appetite
each
one
over
and
over
again
till
i
thought
he
never
would
have
done
them
they
were
on
thick
white
paper
of
a
peculiar
shade
of
whiteness
with
untrimmed
edges
on
each
sheet
a
crest
and
an
address
were
stamped
in
gold
and
all
the
sheets
were
of
the
same
shape
and
size
i
told
myself
that
if
anywhere
at
any
time
i
saw
writing
paper
like
that
again
i
should
not
fail
to
know
it
the
caligraphy
was
like
the
paper
unusual
bold
decided
and
i
should
have
guessed
produced
by
a
j
pen
all
the
time
that
he
was
reading
he
kept
emitting
sounds
more
resembling
yelps
and
snarls
than
anything
more
human
like
some
savage
beast
nursing
its
rage
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
reading
for
the
season
he
let
his
passion
have
full
vent
that
is
what
his
dear
love
has
found
it
in
her
heart
to
write
paul
lessingham
paul
lessingham
pen
can
not
describe
the
concentrated
frenzy
of
hatred
with
which
the
speaker
dwelt
upon
the
name
it
was
demoniac
is
enough
it
is
the
end
it
is
his
doom
he
shall
be
ground
between
the
upper
and
the
nether
stones
in
the
towers
of
anguish
and
all
that
is
left
of
him
shall
be
cast
on
the
accursed
stream
of
the
bitter
waters
to
stink
under
the
sun
and
for
her
for
marjorie
lindon
for
his
dear
love
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
she
shall
wish
that
she
was
never
born
nor
he
and
the
gods
of
the
shadows
shall
smell
the
sweet
incense
of
her
suffering
it
shall
be
it
shall
be
it
is
i
that
say
it
even
i
in
the
madness
of
his
rhapsodical
frenzy
i
believe
that
he
had
actually
forgotten
i
was
there
but
on
a
sudden
glancing
aside
he
saw
me
and
remembered
and
was
prompt
to
take
advantage
of
an
opportunity
to
wreak
his
rage
upon
a
tangible
object
is
you
you
thief
you
still
live
to
make
a
mock
of
one
of
the
children
of
the
gods
he
leaped
shrieking
off
the
bed
and
sprang
at
me
clasping
my
throat
with
his
horrid
hands
bearing
me
backwards
on
to
the
floor
i
felt
his
breath
mingle
with
mine
and
then
god
in
his
mercy
sent
oblivion
book
ii
the
haunted
man
the
story
according
to
sydney
atherton
esquire
chapter
x
rejected
it
was
after
our
second
waltz
i
did
it
in
the
usual
quiet
corner
which
that
time
was
in
the
shadow
of
a
palm
in
the
hall
before
i
had
got
into
my
stride
she
checked
me
touching
my
sleeve
with
her
fan
turning
towards
me
with
startled
eyes
please
but
i
was
not
to
be
stopped
cliff
challoner
passed
with
gerty
cazell
i
fancy
that
as
he
passed
he
nodded
i
did
not
care
i
was
wound
up
to
go
and
i
went
it
no
man
knows
how
he
can
talk
till
he
does
talk
to
the
girl
he
wants
to
marry
it
is
my
impression
that
i
gave
her
recollections
of
the
restoration
poets
she
seemed
surprised
not
having
previously
detected
in
me
the
poetic
strain
and
insisted
on
cutting
in
atherton
i
am
so
sorry
then
i
did
let
fly
that
i
love
you
why
why
should
you
be
sorry
that
you
have
become
the
one
thing
needful
in
any
man
eyes
even
in
mine
the
one
thing
precious
the
one
thing
to
be
altogether
esteemed
is
it
so
common
for
a
woman
to
come
across
a
man
who
would
be
willing
to
lay
down
his
life
for
her
that
she
should
be
sorry
when
she
finds
him
did
not
know
that
you
felt
like
this
though
i
confess
that
i
have
had
my
my
doubts
i
thank
you
are
quite
aware
mr
atherton
that
i
like
you
very
much
me
bah
can
not
help
liking
you
though
it
may
be
bah
do
want
you
to
like
me
i
want
you
to
love
me
that
is
your
mistake
mistake
in
wanting
you
to
love
me
when
i
love
you
you
should
though
i
ca
help
thinking
that
you
are
mistaken
even
there
in
supposing
that
i
love
you
when
i
assert
and
reassert
it
with
the
whole
force
of
my
being
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
to
prove
i
love
you
take
you
in
my
arms
and
crush
you
to
my
bosom
and
make
a
spectacle
of
you
before
every
creature
in
the
place
rather
you
would
and
perhaps
you
would
mind
not
talking
quite
so
loud
mr
challoner
seems
to
be
wondering
what
you
shouting
about
should
torture
me
she
opened
and
shut
her
fan
as
she
looked
down
at
it
i
am
disposed
to
suspect
that
she
smiled
am
glad
we
have
had
this
little
explanation
because
of
course
you
are
my
friend
am
not
your
friend
me
you
are
say
i
not
if
i
ca
be
something
else
i
be
no
friend
she
went
on
calmly
ignoring
me
playing
with
her
fan
it
happens
i
am
just
now
in
rather
a
delicate
position
in
which
a
friend
is
welcome
the
matter
who
been
worrying
you
your
father
he
has
not
as
yet
but
he
may
be
soon
in
the
wind
lessingham
she
dropped
her
voice
and
her
eyes
for
the
moment
i
did
not
catch
her
meaning
friend
mr
lessingham
me
miss
lindon
but
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
anyone
is
entitled
to
call
mr
lessingham
a
friend
of
mine
not
when
i
am
going
to
be
his
wife
that
took
me
aback
i
had
had
my
suspicions
that
paul
lessingham
was
more
with
marjorie
than
he
had
any
right
to
be
but
i
had
never
supposed
that
she
could
see
anything
desirable
in
a
stick
of
a
man
like
that
not
to
speak
of
a
hundred
and
one
other
considerations
lessingham
on
one
side
of
the
house
and
her
father
on
the
other
and
old
lindon
girding
at
him
anywhere
and
everywhere
with
his
tory
notions
of
his
family
importance
to
say
nothing
of
his
fortune
i
do
know
if
i
looked
what
i
felt
if
i
did
i
looked
uncommonly
blank
have
chosen
an
appropriate
moment
miss
lindon
to
make
to
me
such
a
communication
she
chose
to
disregard
my
irony
am
glad
you
think
so
because
now
you
will
understand
what
a
difficult
position
i
am
in
offer
you
my
hearty
congratulations
i
thank
you
for
them
mr
atherton
in
the
spirit
in
which
they
are
offered
because
from
you
i
know
they
mean
so
much
i
bit
my
lip
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
tell
how
she
wished
me
to
read
her
words
i
understand
that
this
announcement
has
been
made
to
me
as
one
of
the
public
do
not
it
is
made
to
you
in
confidence
as
my
friend
as
my
greatest
friend
because
a
husband
is
something
more
than
friend
my
pulses
tingled
will
be
on
my
side
she
had
paused
and
i
stayed
silent
your
side
or
mr
lessingham
side
is
my
side
and
my
side
is
his
side
you
will
be
on
our
side
am
not
sure
that
i
altogether
follow
you
are
the
first
i
have
told
when
papa
hears
it
is
possible
that
there
will
be
trouble
as
you
know
he
thinks
so
much
of
you
and
of
your
opinion
when
that
trouble
comes
i
want
you
to
be
on
our
side
on
my
side
should
i
what
does
it
matter
you
are
stronger
than
your
father
it
is
just
possible
that
lessingham
is
stronger
than
you
together
from
your
father
point
of
view
you
will
be
invincible
are
my
friend
are
you
not
my
friend
effect
you
offer
me
an
apple
of
sodom
you
i
did
not
think
you
so
unkind
you
are
you
kind
i
make
you
an
avowal
of
my
love
and
straightway
you
ask
me
to
act
as
chorus
to
the
love
of
another
could
i
tell
you
loved
me
as
you
say
i
had
no
notion
you
have
known
me
all
your
life
yet
you
have
not
breathed
a
word
of
it
till
now
i
had
spoken
before
i
imagine
that
there
was
a
slight
movement
of
her
shoulders
almost
amounting
to
a
shrug
do
not
know
that
it
would
have
made
any
i
do
not
pretend
that
it
would
but
i
do
know
this
i
believe
that
you
yourself
have
only
discovered
the
state
of
your
own
mind
within
the
last
if
she
had
slapped
my
face
she
could
not
have
startled
me
more
i
had
no
notion
if
her
words
were
uttered
at
random
but
they
came
so
near
the
truth
they
held
me
breathless
it
was
a
fact
that
only
during
the
last
few
minutes
had
i
really
realised
how
things
were
with
me
only
since
the
end
of
that
first
waltz
that
the
flame
had
burst
out
in
my
soul
which
was
now
consuming
me
she
had
read
me
by
what
seemed
so
like
a
flash
of
inspiration
that
i
hardly
knew
what
to
say
to
her
i
tried
to
be
stinging
flatter
me
miss
lindon
you
flatter
me
at
every
point
had
you
only
discovered
to
me
the
state
of
your
mind
a
little
sooner
i
should
not
have
discovered
to
you
the
state
of
mine
at
all
will
consider
it
terra
incognita
you
wish
it
her
provoking
calmness
stung
me
and
the
suspicion
that
she
was
laughing
at
me
in
her
sleeve
i
gave
her
a
glimpse
of
the
cloven
hoof
at
the
same
time
since
you
assert
that
you
have
so
long
been
innocent
i
beg
that
you
will
continue
so
no
more
at
least
your
innocence
shall
be
without
excuse
for
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
i
love
you
that
i
have
loved
you
that
i
shall
love
you
any
understanding
you
may
have
with
mr
lessingham
will
not
make
the
slightest
difference
i
warn
you
miss
lindon
that
until
death
you
will
have
to
write
me
down
your
lover
she
looked
at
me
with
wide
open
eyes
as
if
i
almost
frightened
her
to
be
frank
that
was
what
i
wished
to
do
atherton
lindon
is
not
like
you
at
all
seem
to
be
making
each
other
acquaintance
for
the
first
time
she
continued
to
gaze
at
me
with
her
big
eyes
which
to
be
candid
i
found
it
difficult
to
meet
on
a
sudden
her
face
was
lighted
by
a
smile
which
i
resented
after
all
these
years
not
after
all
these
years
i
know
you
and
though
i
daresay
you
not
flawless
i
fancy
you
be
found
to
ring
pretty
true
her
manner
was
almost
sisterly
i
could
have
shaken
her
hartridge
coming
to
claim
his
dance
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
escape
with
such
remnants
of
dignity
as
i
could
gather
about
me
he
dawdled
up
his
thumbs
as
usual
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
believe
miss
lindon
this
is
our
dance
she
acknowledged
it
with
a
bow
and
rose
to
take
his
arm
i
got
up
and
left
her
without
a
word
as
i
crossed
the
hall
i
chanced
on
percy
woodville
he
was
in
his
familiar
state
of
fluster
and
was
gaping
about
him
as
if
he
had
mislaid
the
and
wondered
where
in
thunder
it
had
got
to
when
he
saw
it
was
i
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
say
atherton
have
you
seen
miss
lindon
have
have
you
by
jove
where
i
been
looking
for
her
all
over
the
place
except
in
the
cellars
and
the
attics
and
i
was
just
going
to
commence
on
them
this
is
our
dance
that
case
she
shunted
you
impossible
his
mouth
went
like
an
o
and
his
eyes
ditto
his
eyeglass
clattering
down
on
to
his
shirt
front
expect
the
mine
fact
is
i
made
a
mess
of
my
programme
it
either
the
last
dance
or
this
dance
or
the
next
that
i
booked
with
her
but
hanged
if
i
know
which
just
take
a
squint
at
it
there
a
good
chap
and
tell
me
which
one
you
think
it
is
i
a
squint
since
he
held
the
thing
within
an
inch
of
my
nose
i
could
hardly
help
it
one
and
that
was
enough
and
more
some
men
ball
programmes
are
studies
in
impressionism
percy
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
study
in
madness
it
was
covered
with
hieroglyphics
but
what
they
meant
or
what
they
did
there
anyhow
it
was
absurd
to
suppose
that
i
could
tell
i
never
put
them
there
proverbially
the
man
a
champion
hasher
regret
my
dear
percy
that
i
am
not
an
expert
in
cuneiform
writing
if
you
have
any
doubt
as
to
which
dance
is
yours
you
better
ask
the
lady
she
feel
flattered
leaving
him
to
do
his
own
addling
i
went
to
find
my
coat
i
panted
to
get
into
the
open
air
as
for
dancing
i
felt
that
i
loathed
it
just
as
i
neared
the
someone
stopped
me
it
was
dora
grayling
you
forgotten
that
this
is
our
dance
i
had
forgotten
clean
and
i
was
not
obliged
by
her
remembering
though
as
i
looked
at
her
sweet
grey
eyes
and
at
the
soft
contours
of
her
gentle
face
i
felt
that
i
deserved
well
kicking
she
is
an
angel
one
of
the
best
but
i
was
in
no
mood
for
angels
not
for
a
very
great
deal
would
i
have
gone
through
that
dance
just
then
nor
with
dora
grayling
of
all
women
in
the
world
would
i
have
sat
it
so
i
was
a
brute
and
blundered
must
forgive
me
miss
grayling
but
i
am
not
feeling
very
well
and
i
do
think
i
up
to
any
more
chapter
xi
a
midnight
episode
the
weather
out
of
doors
was
in
tune
with
my
frame
of
mind
i
was
in
a
deuce
of
a
temper
and
it
was
a
deuce
of
a
night
a
keen
wind
warranted
to
take
the
skin
right
off
you
was
playing
with
intermittent
gusts
of
blinding
rain
since
it
was
not
fit
for
a
dog
to
walk
none
of
your
cabs
for
me
nothing
would
serve
but
pedestrian
exercise
so
i
had
it
i
went
down
park
lane
and
the
wind
and
rain
went
with
me
also
thoughts
of
dora
grayling
what
a
bounder
i
had
been
and
was
if
there
is
anything
in
worse
taste
than
to
book
a
lady
for
a
dance
and
then
to
leave
her
in
the
lurch
i
should
like
to
know
what
that
thing
is
when
found
it
ought
to
be
made
a
note
of
if
any
man
of
my
acquaintance
allowed
himself
to
be
guilty
of
such
a
felony
in
the
first
degree
i
should
cut
him
i
wished
someone
would
try
to
cut
me
i
should
like
to
see
him
at
it
it
was
all
marjorie
fault
everything
past
present
and
to
come
i
had
known
that
girl
when
she
was
in
long
frocks
i
had
at
that
period
of
our
acquaintance
pretty
recently
got
out
of
them
when
she
was
advanced
to
short
ones
and
when
once
more
she
returned
to
long
and
all
that
time
well
i
was
nearly
persuaded
that
the
whole
of
the
time
i
had
loved
her
if
i
had
not
mentioned
it
it
was
because
i
had
suffered
my
affection
the
worm
to
lie
hidden
in
the
bud
or
whatever
it
is
the
fellow
says
at
any
rate
i
was
perfectly
positive
that
if
i
had
had
the
faintest
notion
that
she
would
ever
seriously
consider
such
a
man
as
lessingham
i
should
have
loved
her
long
ago
lessingham
why
he
was
old
enough
to
be
her
father
at
least
he
was
a
good
many
years
older
than
i
was
and
a
wretched
radical
it
is
true
that
on
certain
points
i
also
am
what
some
people
would
call
a
radical
but
not
a
radical
of
the
kind
he
is
thank
heaven
no
no
doubt
i
have
admired
traits
in
his
character
until
i
learnt
this
thing
of
him
i
am
even
prepared
to
admit
that
he
is
a
man
of
ability
in
his
way
which
is
emphatically
not
mine
but
to
think
of
him
in
connection
with
such
a
girl
as
marjorie
lindon
preposterous
why
the
man
as
dry
as
a
stick
drier
and
cold
as
an
iceberg
nothing
but
a
politician
absolutely
he
a
lover
how
i
could
fancy
such
a
stroke
of
humour
setting
all
the
benches
in
a
roar
both
by
education
and
by
nature
he
was
incapable
of
even
playing
such
a
part
as
for
being
the
thing
absurd
if
you
were
to
sink
a
shaft
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
soles
of
his
feet
you
would
find
inside
him
nothing
but
the
dry
bones
of
parties
and
of
politics
what
my
marjorie
if
everyone
had
his
own
she
is
mine
and
in
that
sense
she
always
will
be
mine
what
my
marjorie
could
see
in
such
a
out
of
which
even
to
construct
the
rudiments
of
a
husband
was
beyond
my
fathoming
suchlike
agreeable
reflections
were
fit
company
for
the
wind
and
the
wet
so
they
bore
me
company
all
down
the
lane
i
crossed
at
the
corner
going
round
the
hospital
towards
the
square
this
brought
me
to
the
of
paul
the
apostle
like
the
idiot
i
was
i
went
out
into
the
middle
of
the
street
and
stood
awhile
in
the
mud
to
curse
him
and
his
house
on
the
whole
when
one
considers
that
that
is
the
kind
of
man
i
can
be
it
is
perhaps
not
surprising
that
marjorie
disdained
me
your
following
i
cried
it
is
an
absolute
fact
that
the
words
were
shouted
in
the
house
and
out
of
it
no
longer
regard
you
as
a
leader
may
your
party
follow
after
other
gods
may
your
political
aspirations
wither
and
your
speeches
be
listened
to
by
empty
benches
may
the
speaker
persistently
and
strenuously
refuse
to
allow
you
to
catch
his
eye
and
at
the
next
election
may
your
constituency
reject
you
jehoram
what
that
i
might
well
ask
until
that
moment
i
had
appeared
to
be
the
only
lunatic
at
large
either
outside
the
house
or
in
it
but
on
a
sudden
a
second
lunatic
came
on
the
scene
and
that
with
a
vengeance
a
window
was
crashed
open
from
within
the
one
over
the
front
door
and
someone
came
plunging
through
it
on
to
the
top
of
the
portico
that
it
was
a
case
of
intended
suicide
i
made
sure
and
i
began
to
be
in
hopes
that
i
was
about
to
witness
the
suicide
of
paul
but
i
was
not
so
assured
of
the
intention
when
the
individual
in
question
began
to
scramble
down
the
pillar
of
the
porch
in
the
most
extraordinary
fashion
i
ever
witnessed
i
was
not
even
convinced
of
a
suicidal
purpose
when
he
came
tumbling
down
and
lay
sprawling
in
the
mud
at
my
feet
i
fancy
if
i
had
performed
that
portion
of
the
act
i
should
have
lain
quiet
for
a
second
or
two
to
consider
whereabouts
i
was
and
which
end
of
me
was
uppermost
but
there
was
no
nonsense
of
that
sort
about
that
singularly
agile
stranger
if
he
was
not
made
of
he
ought
to
have
been
so
to
speak
before
he
was
down
he
was
up
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
grab
at
him
before
he
was
off
like
a
rocket
such
a
figure
as
he
presented
is
seldom
seen
at
least
in
the
streets
of
london
what
he
had
done
with
the
rest
of
his
apparel
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
say
all
that
was
left
of
it
was
a
long
dark
cloak
which
he
strove
to
wrap
round
him
save
for
that
and
mud
he
was
bare
as
the
palm
of
my
hand
yet
it
was
his
face
that
held
me
in
my
time
i
have
seen
strange
expressions
on
men
faces
but
never
before
one
such
as
i
saw
on
his
he
looked
like
a
man
might
look
who
after
living
a
life
of
undiluted
crime
at
last
finds
himself
face
to
face
with
the
devil
it
was
not
the
look
of
a
madman
far
from
it
it
was
something
worse
it
was
the
expression
on
the
man
countenance
as
much
as
anything
else
which
made
me
behave
as
i
did
i
said
something
to
him
some
nonsense
i
know
not
what
he
regarded
me
with
a
silence
which
was
supernatural
i
spoke
to
him
again
not
a
word
issued
from
those
rigid
lips
there
was
not
a
tremor
of
those
awful
eyes
eyes
which
i
was
tolerably
convinced
saw
something
which
i
had
never
seen
or
ever
should
then
i
took
my
hand
from
off
his
shoulder
and
let
him
go
i
know
not
why
i
did
he
had
remained
as
motionless
as
a
statue
while
i
held
him
indeed
for
any
evidence
of
life
he
gave
he
might
have
been
a
statue
but
when
my
grasp
was
loosed
how
he
ran
he
had
turned
the
corner
and
was
out
of
sight
before
i
could
say
do
it
was
only
then
when
he
had
gone
and
i
had
realised
the
rate
at
which
he
had
taken
his
departure
that
it
occurred
to
me
of
what
an
extremely
sensible
act
i
had
been
guilty
in
letting
him
go
at
all
here
was
an
individual
who
had
been
committing
burglary
or
something
very
like
it
in
the
house
of
a
budding
cabinet
minister
and
who
had
tumbled
plump
into
my
arms
so
that
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
call
a
policeman
and
get
him
quodded
and
all
that
i
had
done
was
something
of
a
totally
different
kind
a
nice
type
of
an
ideal
citizen
i
was
addressing
myself
first
chop
specimen
of
a
idiot
to
connive
at
the
escape
of
the
robber
who
been
robbing
paul
since
you
let
the
villain
go
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
leave
a
card
on
the
apostle
and
inquire
how
he
feeling
i
went
to
lessingham
front
door
and
knocked
i
knocked
once
i
knocked
twice
i
knocked
thrice
and
the
third
time
i
give
you
my
word
i
made
the
echoes
ring
but
still
there
was
not
a
soul
that
answered
this
is
a
case
of
a
seven
or
murder
and
the
gentleman
in
the
cloak
has
made
a
fair
clearance
of
every
living
creature
the
house
contains
perhaps
it
just
as
well
i
chanced
upon
the
scene
still
i
do
think
that
one
of
the
corpses
might
get
up
to
answer
the
door
if
it
is
possible
to
make
noise
enough
to
waken
the
dead
you
bet
i
on
to
it
and
i
was
i
punished
that
knocker
until
i
warrant
the
pounding
i
gave
it
was
audible
on
the
other
side
of
green
park
and
at
last
i
woke
the
dead
or
rather
i
roused
matthews
to
a
consciousness
that
something
was
going
on
opening
the
door
about
six
inches
through
the
interstice
he
protruded
his
ancient
nose
there
my
dear
sir
nothing
and
no
one
it
must
have
been
your
vigorous
imagination
which
induced
you
to
suppose
that
there
was
you
let
it
run
away
with
you
then
he
knew
me
and
opened
the
door
about
two
feet
it
you
mr
atherton
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
thought
it
might
have
been
the
police
then
do
you
stand
in
terror
of
the
minions
of
the
law
at
last
a
most
discreet
servant
matthews
just
the
fellow
for
a
budding
cabinet
minister
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
i
had
suspected
the
presence
of
a
colleague
at
his
back
now
i
was
assured
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
mouth
and
i
thought
how
exceedingly
discreet
he
looked
in
his
trousers
and
his
stockinged
feet
and
with
his
hair
all
rumpled
and
his
braces
dangling
behind
and
his
nightshirt
creased
sir
i
have
received
instructions
not
to
admit
the
police
deuce
you
have
from
whom
coughing
behind
his
hand
leaning
forward
he
addressed
me
with
an
air
which
was
flatteringly
confidential
mr
lessingham
sir
mr
lessingham
is
not
aware
that
a
robbery
has
been
committed
on
his
premises
that
the
burglar
has
just
come
out
of
his
window
with
a
hop
skip
and
a
jump
bounded
out
of
the
window
like
a
flashed
round
the
corner
like
a
rocket
again
matthews
glanced
over
his
shoulder
as
if
not
clear
which
way
discretion
lay
whether
fore
or
aft
you
sir
i
believe
that
mr
lessingham
is
aware
of
something
of
the
kind
he
seemed
to
come
to
a
sudden
resolution
dropping
his
voice
to
a
whisper
fact
is
sir
that
i
fancy
mr
lessingham
a
good
deal
upset
i
stared
at
him
there
was
something
in
his
manner
i
did
not
understand
do
you
mean
by
upset
has
the
scoundrel
attempted
violence
there
the
voice
was
lessingham
calling
to
matthews
from
the
staircase
though
for
an
instant
i
hardly
recognised
it
it
was
so
curiously
petulant
pushing
past
matthews
i
stepped
into
the
hall
a
young
man
i
suppose
a
footman
in
the
same
undress
as
matthews
was
holding
a
candle
it
seemed
the
only
light
about
the
place
by
its
glimmer
i
perceived
lessingham
standing
up
the
stairs
he
was
in
full
war
paint
as
he
is
not
the
sort
of
man
who
dresses
for
the
house
i
took
it
that
he
had
been
mixing
pleasure
with
business
i
lessingham
atherton
do
you
know
that
a
fellow
has
jumped
out
of
your
window
it
was
a
second
or
two
before
he
answered
when
he
did
his
voice
had
lost
its
petulance
he
escaped
he
a
mile
away
by
now
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
his
tone
when
he
spoke
again
there
was
a
note
of
relief
wondered
if
he
had
poor
fellow
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
take
my
advice
atherton
and
keep
out
of
politics
they
bring
you
into
contact
with
all
the
lunatics
at
large
good
night
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
knocking
us
up
matthews
shut
the
door
tolerably
cool
on
my
honour
a
man
who
brings
news
big
with
the
fate
of
rome
does
not
expect
to
receive
such
treatment
he
expects
to
be
listened
to
with
deference
and
to
hear
all
that
there
is
to
hear
and
not
to
be
sent
to
the
before
he
has
had
a
chance
of
really
opening
his
lips
before
i
knew
it
almost
the
door
was
shut
and
i
was
on
the
doorstep
confound
the
apostle
impudence
next
time
he
might
have
his
house
burnt
down
and
him
in
it
before
i
took
the
trouble
to
touch
his
dirty
knocker
what
did
he
mean
by
his
allusion
to
lunatics
in
politics
did
he
think
to
fool
me
there
was
more
in
the
business
than
met
the
eye
and
a
good
deal
more
than
he
wished
to
meet
mine
hence
his
insolence
the
creature
what
marjorie
lindon
could
see
in
such
an
opusculum
surpassed
my
comprehension
especially
when
there
was
a
man
of
my
sort
walking
about
who
adored
the
very
ground
she
trod
upon
chapter
xii
a
morning
visitor
all
through
the
night
waking
and
sleeping
and
in
my
dreams
i
wondered
what
marjorie
could
see
in
him
in
those
same
dreams
i
satisfied
myself
that
she
could
and
did
see
nothing
in
him
but
everything
in
me
oh
the
comfort
the
misfortune
was
that
when
i
awoke
i
knew
it
was
the
other
way
round
so
that
it
was
a
sad
awakening
an
awakening
to
thoughts
of
murder
so
swallowing
a
mouthful
and
a
peg
i
went
into
my
laboratory
to
plan
murder
legalised
murder
on
the
biggest
scale
it
ever
has
been
planned
i
was
on
the
track
of
a
weapon
which
would
make
war
not
only
an
affair
of
a
single
campaign
but
of
a
single
it
would
not
want
an
army
to
work
it
either
once
let
an
individual
or
two
or
three
at
most
in
possession
of
my
get
within
a
mile
or
so
of
even
the
largest
body
of
disciplined
troops
that
ever
yet
a
nation
put
into
the
field
and
pouf
in
about
the
time
it
takes
you
to
say
that
they
would
be
all
dead
men
if
weapons
of
precision
which
may
be
relied
upon
to
slay
are
preservers
of
the
peace
and
the
man
is
a
fool
who
says
that
they
are
not
then
i
was
within
reach
of
the
finest
preserver
of
the
peace
imagination
ever
yet
conceived
what
a
sublime
thought
to
think
that
in
the
hollow
of
your
own
hand
lies
the
life
and
death
of
nations
and
it
was
almost
in
mine
i
had
in
front
of
me
some
of
the
finest
destructive
agents
you
could
wish
to
light
upon
conine
potassamide
cyanogen
when
edwards
entered
i
was
wearing
a
mask
of
my
own
invention
a
thing
that
covered
ears
and
head
and
everything
something
like
a
diver
helmet
i
was
dealing
with
gases
a
sniff
of
which
meant
death
only
a
few
days
before
unmasked
i
had
been
doing
some
fool
trick
with
a
couple
of
acids
sulphuric
and
cyanide
of
potassium
when
somehow
my
hand
slipped
and
before
i
knew
it
minute
portions
of
them
combined
by
the
mercy
of
providence
i
fell
backwards
instead
of
forwards
sequel
about
an
hour
afterwards
edwards
found
me
on
the
floor
and
it
took
the
remainder
of
that
day
and
most
of
the
doctors
in
town
to
bring
me
back
to
life
again
edwards
announced
his
presence
by
touching
me
on
the
shoulder
when
i
am
wearing
that
mask
it
is
always
easy
to
make
me
hear
wishes
to
see
you
sir
tell
someone
that
i
do
wish
to
see
him
servant
edwards
he
walked
off
with
the
message
as
decorously
as
you
please
and
then
i
thought
there
was
an
end
but
there
was
i
was
regulating
the
valve
of
a
cylinder
in
which
i
was
fusing
some
oxides
when
once
more
someone
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
without
turning
i
took
it
for
granted
it
was
edwards
back
again
have
only
to
give
a
tiny
twist
to
this
tap
my
good
fellow
and
you
will
be
in
the
land
where
the
bogies
bloom
why
will
you
come
where
you
not
wanted
then
i
looked
round
the
devil
are
you
for
it
was
not
edwards
at
all
but
quite
a
different
class
of
character
i
found
myself
confronting
an
individual
who
might
almost
have
sat
for
one
of
the
bogies
i
had
just
alluded
to
his
costume
was
reminiscent
of
the
whom
one
finds
all
over
france
and
who
are
the
most
persistent
insolent
and
amusing
of
pedlars
i
remember
one
who
used
to
haunt
the
repetitions
at
the
alcazar
at
tours
but
there
this
individual
was
like
the
originals
yet
unlike
he
was
less
gaudy
and
a
good
deal
dingier
than
his
gallic
prototypes
are
apt
to
be
then
he
wore
a
burnoose
the
yellow
article
of
the
arab
of
the
soudan
not
the
spick
and
span
arab
of
the
boulevard
chief
difference
of
all
his
face
was
clean
shaven
and
whoever
saw
an
algerian
of
paris
whose
chiefest
glory
was
not
his
moustache
and
beard
i
expected
that
he
would
address
me
in
the
lingo
which
these
gentlemen
call
french
but
he
did
are
mr
atherton
you
are
mr
who
how
did
you
come
here
where
my
servant
the
fellow
held
up
his
hand
as
he
did
so
as
if
in
accordance
with
a
signal
edwards
came
into
the
room
looking
excessively
startled
i
turned
to
him
this
the
person
who
wished
to
see
me
sir
i
tell
you
to
say
that
i
did
wish
to
see
him
sir
why
did
you
do
as
i
told
you
did
sir
how
comes
he
here
sir
edwards
put
his
hand
up
to
his
head
as
if
he
was
half
asleep
do
quite
know
do
you
mean
by
you
do
know
why
did
you
stop
him
think
sir
that
i
must
have
had
a
touch
of
sudden
faintness
because
i
tried
to
put
out
my
hand
to
stop
him
and
i
could
an
go
and
he
went
i
turned
to
the
stranger
sir
are
you
a
magician
he
replied
to
my
question
with
another
mr
atherton
are
you
also
a
magician
he
was
staring
at
my
mask
with
an
evident
lack
of
comprehension
wear
this
because
in
this
place
death
lurks
in
so
many
subtle
forms
that
without
it
i
dare
not
breathe
he
inclined
his
head
though
i
doubt
if
he
understood
so
good
as
to
tell
me
briefly
what
it
is
you
wish
with
me
he
slipped
his
hand
into
the
folds
of
his
burnoose
and
taking
out
a
slip
of
paper
laid
it
on
the
shelf
by
which
we
were
standing
i
glanced
at
it
expecting
to
find
on
it
a
petition
or
a
testimonial
or
a
true
statement
of
his
sad
case
instead
it
contained
two
words
only
lindon
the
sight
of
that
name
brought
the
blood
into
my
cheeks
come
from
miss
lindon
he
narrowed
his
shoulders
brought
his
together
inclined
his
head
in
a
fashion
which
was
peculiarly
oriental
but
not
particularly
explanatory
so
i
repeated
my
question
you
wish
me
to
understand
that
you
do
come
from
miss
lindon
again
he
slipped
his
hand
into
his
burnoose
again
he
produced
a
slip
of
paper
again
he
laid
it
on
the
shelf
again
i
glanced
at
it
again
nothing
was
written
on
it
but
a
name
lessingham
i
see
paul
what
then
is
good
he
is
bad
is
it
not
so
he
touched
first
one
scrap
of
paper
then
the
other
i
stared
how
do
you
happen
to
know
shall
never
have
her
eh
on
earth
do
you
mean
what
do
i
mean
what
do
you
mean
and
also
and
at
the
same
time
who
the
devil
are
you
is
as
a
friend
i
come
to
you
in
that
case
you
may
go
i
happen
to
be
in
that
line
just
now
with
the
kind
of
friend
i
am
saints
forefend
love
her
you
love
miss
lindon
can
you
bear
to
think
of
him
in
her
arms
i
took
off
my
mask
feeling
that
the
occasion
required
it
as
i
did
so
he
brushed
aside
the
hanging
folds
of
the
hood
of
his
burnoose
so
that
i
saw
more
of
his
face
i
was
immediately
conscious
that
in
his
eyes
there
was
in
an
especial
degree
what
for
want
of
a
better
term
one
may
call
the
mesmeric
quality
that
his
was
one
of
those
morbid
organisations
which
are
oftener
found
thank
goodness
in
the
east
than
in
the
west
and
which
are
apt
to
exercise
an
uncanny
influence
over
the
weak
and
the
foolish
folk
with
whom
they
come
in
contact
the
kind
of
creature
for
whom
it
is
always
just
as
well
to
keep
a
seasoned
rope
close
handy
i
was
also
conscious
that
he
was
taking
advantage
of
the
removal
of
my
mask
to
try
his
strength
on
me
than
which
he
could
not
have
found
a
tougher
job
the
sensitive
something
which
is
found
in
the
hypnotic
subject
happens
in
me
to
be
wholly
absent
see
you
are
a
mesmerist
he
started
am
nothing
a
shadow
i
a
scientist
i
should
like
with
your
permission
or
without
it
to
try
an
experiment
or
two
on
you
he
moved
further
back
there
came
a
gleam
into
his
eyes
which
suggested
that
he
possessed
his
hideous
power
to
an
unusual
degree
that
in
the
estimation
of
his
own
people
he
was
qualified
to
take
his
standing
as
a
regular
will
try
experiments
together
you
and
i
on
paul
lessingham
on
him
do
not
know
do
not
do
you
lie
to
me
do
lie
to
you
i
have
the
faintest
notion
what
is
the
nature
of
your
interest
in
mr
lessingham
interest
that
is
another
thing
it
is
your
interest
of
which
we
are
speaking
me
it
is
yours
you
love
her
and
he
but
at
a
word
from
you
he
shall
not
have
her
never
it
is
i
who
say
it
i
once
more
sir
who
are
you
am
of
the
children
of
isis
that
so
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
have
made
a
slight
mistake
this
is
london
not
a
in
the
desert
i
not
know
what
does
it
matter
you
shall
see
there
will
come
a
time
when
you
will
want
me
you
will
find
that
you
can
not
bear
to
think
of
him
in
her
arms
her
whom
you
love
you
will
call
to
me
and
i
shall
come
and
of
paul
lessingham
there
shall
be
an
end
while
i
was
wondering
whether
he
was
really
as
mad
as
he
sounded
or
whether
he
was
some
impudent
charlatan
who
had
an
axe
of
his
own
to
grind
and
thought
that
he
had
found
in
me
a
grindstone
he
had
vanished
from
the
room
i
moved
after
him
it
all
stop
i
cried
he
must
have
made
pretty
good
travelling
because
before
i
had
a
foot
in
the
hall
i
heard
the
front
door
slam
and
when
i
reached
the
street
intent
on
calling
him
back
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
was
there
a
sign
of
him
to
be
seen
chapter
xiii
the
picture
wonder
what
that
beggar
really
means
and
who
he
happens
to
be
that
was
what
i
said
to
myself
when
i
returned
to
the
laboratory
it
is
true
that
now
and
again
providence
does
write
a
man
character
on
his
face
then
there
ca
be
the
slightest
shred
of
a
doubt
that
a
curious
one
been
written
on
his
i
wonder
what
his
connection
has
been
with
the
apostle
or
if
it
only
part
of
his
game
of
bluff
i
strode
up
and
down
for
the
moment
my
interest
in
the
experiments
i
was
conducting
had
waned
it
was
all
bluff
i
never
saw
a
better
piece
of
acting
and
yet
what
sort
of
finger
can
such
a
precisian
as
st
paul
have
in
such
a
pie
the
fellow
seemed
to
squirm
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
name
can
the
objection
be
political
let
me
consider
what
has
lessingham
done
which
could
offend
the
religious
or
patriotic
susceptibilities
of
the
most
fanatical
of
orientals
politically
i
can
recall
nothing
foreign
affairs
as
a
rule
he
has
carefully
eschewed
if
he
has
offended
and
if
he
has
the
seeming
was
uncommonly
good
the
cause
will
have
to
be
sought
upon
some
other
track
but
then
what
track
the
more
i
strove
to
puzzle
it
out
the
greater
the
puzzlement
grew
the
rascal
has
had
no
more
connection
with
st
paul
than
st
peter
the
probability
is
that
he
a
crackpot
and
if
he
is
he
has
some
little
game
on
foot
in
close
association
with
the
hunt
of
the
which
he
tried
to
work
off
on
me
but
could
as
for
for
marjorie
my
marjorie
only
she
is
mine
confound
it
if
i
had
had
my
senses
about
me
i
should
have
broken
his
head
in
several
places
for
daring
to
allow
her
name
to
pass
his
lips
the
unbaptised
mohammedan
now
to
return
to
the
chase
of
splendid
murder
i
snatched
up
my
mask
one
of
the
most
ingenious
inventions
by
the
way
of
recent
years
if
the
armies
of
the
future
wear
my
mask
they
will
defy
my
weapon
and
was
about
to
it
in
its
place
when
someone
knocked
at
the
door
there
come
in
it
was
edwards
he
looked
round
him
as
if
surprised
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
thought
you
were
engaged
i
did
know
that
that
gentleman
had
gone
went
up
the
chimney
as
all
that
kind
of
gentlemen
why
the
deuce
did
you
let
him
in
when
i
told
you
not
to
sir
i
know
i
gave
him
your
message
and
he
looked
at
me
and
that
is
all
i
remember
till
i
found
myself
standing
in
this
room
had
it
not
been
edwards
i
might
have
suspected
him
of
having
had
his
palm
well
greased
but
in
his
case
i
knew
better
it
was
as
i
thought
my
visitor
was
a
mesmerist
of
the
first
class
he
had
actually
played
some
of
his
tricks
in
broad
daylight
on
my
servant
at
my
own
front
door
a
man
worth
studying
edwards
continued
is
someone
else
sir
who
wishes
to
see
you
mr
lessingham
lessingham
at
that
moment
the
juxtaposition
seemed
odd
though
i
daresay
it
was
so
rather
in
appearance
than
in
reality
him
in
presently
in
came
paul
i
am
free
to
confess
i
have
owned
it
before
that
in
a
sense
i
admire
that
man
so
long
as
he
does
not
presume
to
thrust
himself
into
a
certain
position
he
possesses
physical
qualities
which
please
my
eye
speaking
as
a
mere
biologist
like
the
suggestion
conveyed
by
his
every
pose
his
every
movement
of
a
tenacious
hold
on
life
of
reserve
force
of
a
repository
of
bone
and
gristle
on
which
he
can
fall
back
at
pleasure
the
fellow
lithe
and
active
not
hasty
yet
agile
clean
built
well
hung
the
sort
of
man
who
might
be
relied
upon
to
make
a
good
recovery
you
might
beat
him
in
a
sprint
mental
or
physical
though
to
do
that
you
would
have
to
be
spry
but
in
a
staying
race
he
would
see
you
out
i
do
not
know
that
he
is
exactly
the
kind
of
man
whom
i
would
trust
unless
i
knew
that
he
was
on
the
job
which
knowledge
in
his
case
would
be
uncommonly
hard
to
attain
he
is
too
calm
too
with
the
knack
of
looking
all
round
him
even
in
moments
of
extremest
peril
and
for
whatever
he
does
he
has
a
good
excuse
he
has
the
reputation
both
in
the
house
and
out
of
it
of
being
a
man
of
iron
nerve
and
with
some
reason
yet
i
am
not
so
sure
unless
i
read
him
wrongly
his
is
one
of
those
individualities
which
confronted
by
certain
eventualities
collapse
to
rise
the
moment
of
trial
having
passed
like
phoenix
from
her
ashes
however
it
might
be
with
his
adherents
he
would
show
no
trace
of
his
disaster
and
this
was
the
man
whom
marjorie
loved
well
she
could
show
some
cause
he
was
a
man
of
position
destined
probably
to
rise
much
higher
a
man
of
parts
with
capacity
to
make
the
most
of
them
not
with
agreeable
manners
when
he
chose
and
he
came
within
the
lady
definition
of
a
gentleman
always
did
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
in
the
right
way
and
yet
well
i
take
it
that
we
are
all
cads
and
that
we
most
of
us
are
prigs
for
mercy
sake
do
not
let
us
all
give
ourselves
away
he
was
dressed
as
a
gentleman
should
be
dressed
black
frock
coat
black
vest
dark
grey
trousers
collar
bow
gloves
of
the
proper
shade
neatly
brushed
hair
and
a
smile
which
if
was
not
childlike
at
any
rate
was
bland
am
not
disturbing
you
at
all
i
never
enter
a
place
like
this
where
a
man
is
matching
himself
with
nature
to
wrest
from
her
her
secrets
without
feeling
that
i
am
crossing
the
threshold
of
the
unknown
the
last
time
i
was
in
this
room
was
just
after
you
had
taken
out
the
final
patents
for
your
system
of
telegraphy
at
sea
which
the
admiralty
purchased
wisely
what
is
it
now
really
what
do
you
mean
you
are
a
member
of
the
next
government
you
will
possibly
learn
i
may
offer
them
the
refusal
of
a
new
wrinkle
in
the
art
of
murder
see
a
new
how
long
is
this
race
to
continue
between
attack
and
defence
the
sun
grows
cold
then
be
no
defence
nothing
to
defend
he
looked
at
me
with
his
calm
grave
eyes
theory
of
the
age
of
ice
towards
which
we
are
advancing
is
not
a
cheerful
one
he
began
to
finger
a
glass
retort
which
lay
upon
a
table
the
way
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
give
me
a
look
in
last
night
i
am
afraid
you
thought
me
peremptory
i
have
come
to
apologise
do
know
that
i
thought
you
peremptory
i
thought
you
queer
he
glanced
at
me
with
that
expressionless
look
upon
his
face
which
he
could
summon
at
will
and
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
superstition
about
his
iron
nerve
was
worried
and
not
well
besides
one
does
care
to
be
burgled
even
by
a
maniac
he
a
maniac
you
see
him
clearly
the
street
close
were
you
to
him
than
i
am
to
you
i
did
know
you
were
so
close
to
him
as
that
did
you
try
to
stop
him
said
than
done
he
was
off
at
such
a
rate
you
see
how
he
was
dressed
or
rather
undressed
did
nothing
but
a
cloak
on
such
a
night
who
but
a
fanatic
would
have
attempted
burglary
in
such
a
costume
he
take
anything
nothing
seems
to
have
been
a
curious
episode
he
moved
his
eyebrows
according
to
members
of
the
house
the
only
gesture
in
which
he
has
been
known
to
indulge
become
accustomed
to
curious
episodes
oblige
me
by
not
mentioning
it
to
anyone
to
anyone
he
repeated
the
last
two
words
as
if
to
give
them
emphasis
i
wondered
if
he
was
thinking
of
marjorie
am
communicating
with
the
police
until
they
move
i
do
want
it
to
get
into
the
papers
or
to
be
talked
about
it
a
worry
you
understand
i
nodded
he
changed
the
theme
that
you
engaged
upon
is
it
a
projectile
or
a
weapon
you
are
a
member
of
the
next
government
you
will
possibly
know
if
you
are
you
possibly
wo
suppose
you
have
to
keep
this
sort
of
thing
secret
do
it
seems
that
matters
of
much
less
moment
you
wish
to
keep
secret
mean
that
business
of
last
night
if
a
trifle
of
that
sort
gets
into
the
papers
or
gets
talked
about
which
is
the
same
thing
you
have
no
notion
how
we
are
pestered
it
becomes
an
almost
unbearable
nuisance
jones
the
unknown
can
commit
murder
with
less
inconvenience
to
himself
than
jones
the
notorious
can
have
his
pocket
picked
there
is
not
so
much
exaggeration
in
that
as
there
thanks
for
your
promise
i
had
given
him
no
promise
but
that
was
by
the
way
he
turned
as
to
go
then
stopped
another
thing
i
believe
you
a
specialist
on
questions
of
ancient
superstitions
and
extinct
religions
am
interested
in
such
subjects
but
i
am
not
a
specialist
you
tell
me
what
were
the
exact
tenets
of
the
worshippers
of
isis
i
nor
any
man
with
scientific
certainty
as
you
know
she
had
a
brother
the
cult
of
osiris
and
isis
was
one
and
the
same
what
precisely
were
its
dogmas
or
its
practices
or
anything
about
it
none
now
can
tell
the
papyri
hieroglyphics
and
so
on
which
remain
are
very
far
from
being
exhaustive
and
our
knowledge
of
those
which
do
remain
is
still
less
so
suppose
that
the
marvels
which
are
told
of
it
are
purely
legendary
what
marvels
do
you
particularly
refer
supernatural
powers
attributed
to
the
priests
of
isis
speaking
at
that
time
supernatural
powers
were
attributed
to
all
the
priests
of
all
the
creeds
see
presently
he
continued
presume
that
her
cult
is
long
since
extinct
that
none
of
the
worshippers
of
isis
exist
i
hesitated
i
was
wondering
why
he
had
hit
on
such
a
subject
if
he
really
had
a
reason
or
if
he
was
merely
asking
questions
as
a
cover
for
something
else
you
see
i
knew
my
paul
is
not
so
sure
he
looked
at
me
with
that
passionless
yet
searching
glance
of
his
think
that
she
still
is
worshipped
think
it
possible
even
probable
that
here
and
there
in
africa
africa
is
a
large
order
homage
is
paid
to
isis
quite
in
the
good
old
way
you
know
that
as
a
fact
me
but
do
you
know
it
as
a
fact
are
you
aware
that
you
are
treating
me
as
if
i
was
on
the
witness
stand
have
you
any
special
purpose
in
making
these
inquiries
he
smiled
a
kind
of
a
way
i
have
i
have
recently
come
across
rather
a
curious
story
i
am
trying
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
is
the
story
am
afraid
that
at
present
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
it
you
when
i
am
i
will
you
will
find
it
interesting
as
an
instance
of
a
singular
did
the
followers
of
isis
believe
in
transmigration
of
them
no
doubt
did
they
understand
by
transmigration
but
of
the
soul
or
of
the
body
do
you
mean
transmigration
is
transmigration
are
you
driving
at
something
in
particular
if
you
tell
me
fairly
and
squarely
what
it
is
i
do
my
best
to
give
you
the
information
you
require
as
it
is
your
questions
are
a
bit
perplexing
it
does
matter
as
you
say
transmigration
is
transmigration
i
was
eyeing
him
keenly
i
seemed
to
detect
in
his
manner
an
odd
reluctance
to
enlarge
on
the
subject
he
himself
had
started
he
continued
to
trifle
with
the
retort
upon
the
table
the
followers
of
isis
a
what
shall
i
say
a
sacred
emblem
they
an
especial
regard
for
some
sort
of
a
was
it
some
sort
of
a
beetle
mean
scarabaeus
sacer
according
to
latreille
scarabaeus
egyptiorum
undoubtedly
the
scarab
was
venerated
throughout
egypt
indeed
speaking
generally
most
things
that
had
life
for
instance
cats
as
you
know
orisis
continued
among
men
in
the
figure
of
apis
the
bull
the
priests
of
isis
or
some
of
them
supposed
to
assume
after
death
the
form
of
a
scarabaeus
never
heard
of
it
you
sure
think
should
like
to
answer
such
a
question
positively
offhand
but
i
do
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
recall
any
supposition
of
the
kind
laugh
at
me
i
not
a
lunatic
but
i
understand
that
recent
researches
have
shown
that
even
in
some
of
the
most
astounding
of
the
ancient
legends
there
was
a
substratum
of
fact
is
it
absolutely
certain
that
there
could
be
no
shred
of
truth
in
such
a
belief
what
belief
the
belief
that
a
priest
of
isis
or
anyone
assumed
after
death
the
form
of
a
scarabaeus
seems
to
me
lessingham
that
you
have
lately
come
across
some
uncommonly
interesting
data
of
a
kind
too
which
it
is
your
bounden
duty
to
give
to
the
world
or
at
any
rate
to
that
portion
of
the
world
which
is
represented
by
me
come
tell
us
all
about
it
what
are
you
afraid
of
am
afraid
of
nothing
and
some
day
you
shall
be
told
but
not
now
at
present
answer
my
question
repeat
your
question
clearly
it
absolutely
certain
that
there
could
be
no
foundation
of
truth
in
the
belief
that
a
priest
of
isis
or
anyone
assumed
after
death
the
form
of
a
beetle
know
no
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
how
the
dickens
should
i
such
a
belief
may
have
been
symbolical
christians
believe
that
after
death
the
body
takes
the
shape
of
worms
and
so
in
a
sense
it
does
and
sometimes
eels
is
not
what
i
mean
what
do
you
mean
if
a
person
of
whose
veracity
there
could
not
be
a
vestige
of
a
doubt
assured
you
that
he
had
seen
such
a
transformation
actually
take
place
could
it
conceivably
be
explained
on
natural
grounds
a
priest
of
isis
assume
the
form
of
a
beetle
a
follower
of
isis
or
after
death
he
hesitated
i
had
seldom
seen
him
wear
such
an
appearance
of
interest
to
be
frank
i
was
keenly
interested
too
but
on
a
sudden
there
came
into
his
eyes
a
glint
of
something
that
was
almost
terror
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
the
most
unwonted
awkwardness
in
the
very
act
of
dying
the
very
act
of
dying
he
had
seen
a
follower
of
isis
in
the
very
act
of
dying
assume
the
form
of
a
a
beetle
on
any
conceivable
grounds
would
such
a
transformation
be
susceptible
of
a
natural
explanation
i
stared
as
who
would
not
such
an
extraordinary
question
was
rendered
more
extraordinary
by
coming
from
such
a
man
yet
i
was
almost
beginning
to
suspect
that
there
was
something
behind
it
more
extraordinary
still
here
lessingham
i
can
see
you
a
capital
tale
to
tell
so
tell
it
man
unless
i
mistaken
it
not
the
kind
of
tale
in
which
ordinary
scruples
can
have
any
part
or
parcel
anyhow
it
hardly
fair
of
you
to
set
my
curiosity
all
agog
and
then
to
leave
it
unappeased
he
eyed
me
steadily
the
appearance
of
interest
fading
more
and
more
until
presently
his
face
assumed
its
wonted
expressionless
mask
somehow
i
was
conscious
that
what
he
had
seen
in
my
face
was
not
altogether
to
his
liking
his
voice
was
once
more
bland
and
perceive
you
are
of
opinion
that
i
have
been
told
a
taradiddle
i
suppose
i
have
what
is
the
taradiddle
do
you
see
i
burning
atherton
i
am
on
my
honour
until
i
have
permission
to
unloose
it
my
tongue
is
tied
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
umbrella
from
where
he
had
placed
them
on
the
table
holding
them
in
his
left
hand
he
advanced
to
me
with
his
right
outstretched
is
very
good
of
you
to
suffer
my
continued
interruption
i
know
to
my
sorrow
what
such
interruptions
mean
believe
me
i
am
not
ungrateful
what
is
this
on
the
shelf
within
a
foot
or
so
of
where
i
stood
was
a
sheet
of
paper
the
size
and
shape
of
half
a
sheet
of
post
note
at
this
he
stooped
to
glance
as
he
did
so
something
surprising
occurred
on
the
instant
a
look
came
on
to
his
face
which
literally
transfigured
him
his
hat
and
umbrella
fell
from
his
grasp
on
to
the
floor
he
retreated
gibbering
his
hands
held
out
as
if
to
ward
something
off
from
him
until
he
reached
the
wall
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
a
more
amazing
spectacle
than
he
presented
i
never
saw
i
exclaimed
wrong
with
you
my
first
impression
was
that
he
was
struck
by
a
fit
of
epilepsy
though
anyone
less
like
an
epileptic
subject
it
would
be
hard
to
find
in
my
bewilderment
i
looked
round
to
see
what
could
be
the
immediate
cause
my
eye
fell
upon
the
sheet
of
paper
i
stared
at
it
with
considerable
surprise
i
had
not
noticed
it
there
previously
i
had
not
put
it
there
where
had
it
come
from
the
curious
thing
was
that
on
it
produced
apparently
by
some
process
of
photogravure
was
an
illustration
of
a
species
of
beetle
with
which
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
be
acquainted
and
yet
was
not
it
was
of
a
dull
golden
green
the
colour
was
so
well
brought
out
even
to
the
extent
of
seeming
to
scintillate
and
the
whole
thing
was
so
dexterously
done
that
the
creature
seemed
alive
the
semblance
of
reality
was
indeed
so
vivid
that
it
needed
a
second
glance
to
be
assured
that
it
was
a
mere
trick
of
the
reproducer
its
presence
there
was
odd
after
what
we
had
been
talking
about
it
might
seem
to
need
explanation
but
it
was
absurd
to
suppose
that
that
alone
could
have
had
such
an
effect
on
a
man
like
lessingham
with
the
thing
in
my
hand
i
crossed
to
where
he
was
pressing
his
back
against
the
wall
he
had
shrunk
lower
inch
by
inch
till
he
was
actually
crouching
on
his
haunches
come
man
what
wrong
with
you
taking
him
by
the
shoulder
i
shook
him
with
some
vigour
my
touch
had
on
him
the
effect
of
seeming
to
wake
him
out
of
a
dream
of
restoring
him
to
consciousness
as
against
the
nightmare
horrors
with
which
he
was
struggling
he
gazed
up
at
me
with
that
look
of
cunning
on
his
face
which
one
associates
with
abject
terror
is
it
you
it
all
right
quite
i
well
very
well
as
he
spoke
he
slowly
drew
himself
up
till
he
was
standing
erect
in
that
case
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
have
a
queer
way
of
being
very
well
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
mouth
as
if
to
hide
the
trembling
of
his
lips
the
pressure
of
overwork
i
had
one
or
two
attacks
like
this
but
it
nothing
only
a
local
lesion
i
observed
him
keenly
to
my
thinking
there
was
something
about
him
which
was
very
odd
indeed
a
local
lesion
if
you
take
my
advice
you
get
a
medical
opinion
without
delay
if
you
have
been
wise
enough
to
have
done
so
already
go
at
once
but
i
know
it
only
mental
overstrain
sure
it
nothing
to
do
with
this
i
held
out
in
front
of
him
the
photogravure
of
the
beetle
as
i
did
so
he
backed
away
from
me
shrieking
trembling
as
with
palsy
it
away
take
it
away
he
screamed
i
stared
at
him
for
some
seconds
astonished
into
speechlessness
then
i
found
my
tongue
it
only
a
picture
are
you
stark
mad
he
persisted
in
his
ejaculations
it
away
take
it
away
tear
it
up
burn
it
his
agitation
was
so
unnatural
from
whatever
cause
it
arose
that
fearing
the
recurrence
of
the
attack
from
which
he
had
just
recovered
i
did
as
he
bade
me
i
tore
the
sheet
of
paper
into
quarters
and
striking
a
match
set
fire
to
each
separate
piece
he
watched
the
process
of
incineration
as
if
fascinated
when
it
was
concluded
and
nothing
but
ashes
remained
he
gave
a
gasp
of
relief
i
said
either
mad
already
or
you
going
mad
which
is
it
think
it
neither
i
believe
i
am
as
sane
as
you
it
it
that
story
of
which
i
was
speaking
it
it
seems
curious
but
i
tell
you
all
about
it
some
day
as
i
observed
i
think
you
will
find
it
an
interesting
instance
of
a
singular
survival
he
made
an
obvious
effort
to
become
more
like
his
usual
self
is
extremely
unfortunate
atherton
that
i
should
have
troubled
you
with
such
a
display
of
weakness
especially
as
i
am
able
to
offer
you
so
scant
an
explanation
one
thing
i
would
ask
of
you
to
observe
strict
confidence
what
has
taken
place
has
been
between
ourselves
i
am
in
your
hands
but
you
are
my
friend
i
know
i
can
rely
on
you
not
to
speak
of
it
to
anyone
and
in
particular
not
to
breathe
a
hint
of
it
to
miss
lindon
in
particular
not
to
miss
lindon
you
not
guess
i
hunched
my
shoulder
what
i
guess
is
what
you
mean
is
not
that
a
cause
the
more
why
silence
would
be
unfair
to
her
is
for
me
to
speak
if
for
anyone
i
shall
not
fail
to
do
what
should
be
give
me
your
promise
that
you
will
not
hint
a
word
to
her
of
what
you
have
so
unfortunately
seen
i
gave
him
the
promise
he
required
there
was
no
more
work
for
me
that
day
the
apostle
his
divagations
his
example
of
the
coleoptera
his
arabian
friend
these
things
were
as
microbes
which
acting
on
a
system
already
predisposed
for
their
reception
produced
high
fever
i
was
in
a
fever
of
unrest

paul
had
gone
i
tried
to
think
things
out
and
if
i
had
kept
on
trying
something
would
have
happened
so
i
went
on

instead
chapter
xiv
the
duchess
ball
that
night
was
the
duchess
of
datchet
ball
the
first
person
i
saw
as
i
entered
the
was
dora
grayling
i
went
straight
up
to
her
grayling
i
behaved
very
badly
to
you
last
night
i
have
come
to
make
to
you
my
apologies
to
sue
for
your
forgiveness
forgiveness
her
head
went
back
she
has
a
pretty
trick
of
cocking
it
a
little
on
one
side
were
not
well
are
you
better
you
forgive
me
then
grant
me
plenary
absolution
by
giving
me
a
dance
for
the
one
i
lost
last
night
she
rose
a
man
came
up
a
stranger
to
me
she
one
of
the
best
hunted
women
in
england
there
a
million
with
her
is
my
dance
miss
grayling
she
looked
at
him
must
excuse
me
i
am
afraid
i
have
made
a
mistake
i
had
forgotten
that
i
was
already
engaged
i
had
not
thought
her
capable
of
it
she
took
my
arm
and
away
we
went
and
left
him
staring
he
who
the
sufferer
now
i
whispered
as
we
went
round
she
can
waltz
think
so
it
was
i
last
night
i
did
not
mean
if
i
could
help
it
to
suffer
again
to
me
a
dance
with
you
means
something
she
went
all
red
adding
as
an
afterthought
so
few
men
really
dance
i
expect
it
because
you
dance
so
well
you
we
danced
the
waltz
right
through
then
we
went
to
an
impromptu
shelter
which
had
been
rigged
up
on
a
balcony
and
we
talked
there
something
sympathetic
about
miss
grayling
which
leads
one
to
talk
about
self
before
i
was
half
aware
of
it
i
was
telling
her
of
all
my
plans
and
projects
actually
telling
her
of
my
latest
notion
which
ultimately
was
to
result
in
the
destruction
of
whole
armies
as
by
a
flash
of
lightning
she
took
an
amount
of
interest
in
it
which
was
surprising
really
stands
in
the
way
of
things
of
this
sort
is
not
theory
but
practice
one
can
prove
one
facts
on
paper
or
on
a
small
scale
in
a
room
what
is
wanted
is
proof
on
a
large
scale
by
actual
experiment
if
for
instance
i
could
take
my
plant
to
one
of
the
forests
of
south
america
where
there
is
plenty
of
animal
life
but
no
human
i
could
demonstrate
the
soundness
of
my
position
then
and
there
do
you
of
the
money
it
would
cost
thought
i
was
a
friend
of
yours
had
hoped
you
were
why
do
you
let
me
help
you
me
how
letting
you
have
the
money
for
your
south
american
experiment
it
would
be
an
investment
on
which
i
should
expect
to
receive
good
interest
i
fidgeted
is
very
good
of
you
miss
grayling
to
talk
like
that
she
became
quite
frigid
do
be
absurd
i
perceive
quite
clearly
that
you
are
snubbing
me
and
that
you
are
trying
to
do
it
as
delicately
as
you
know
how
grayling
understand
that
it
was
an
impertinence
on
my
part
to
volunteer
assistance
which
was
unasked
you
have
made
that
sufficiently
plain
assure
you
do
of
course
if
it
had
been
miss
lindon
it
would
have
been
different
she
would
at
least
have
received
a
civil
answer
but
we
are
not
all
miss
lindon
i
was
aghast
the
outburst
was
so
uncalled
for
i
had
not
the
faintest
notion
what
i
had
said
or
done
to
cause
it
she
was
in
such
a
surprising
passion
and
it
suited
her
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
her
look
prettier
i
could
do
nothing
else
but
stare
so
she
went
on
with
just
as
little
reason
is
someone
coming
to
claim
this
dance
i
ca
throw
all
my
partners
over
have
i
offended
you
so
irremediably
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
dance
with
me
again
grayling
i
shall
be
only
too
delighted
she
handed
me
her
card
may
i
have
your
own
sake
you
had
better
place
it
as
far
off
as
you
possibly
can
all
seem
taken
does
matter
strike
off
any
name
you
please
anywhere
and
put
your
own
instead
it
was
giving
me
an
almost
embarrassingly
free
hand
i
booked
myself
for
the
next
waltz
but
two
who
it
was
who
would
have
to
give
way
to
me
i
did
not
trouble
to
inquire
atherton
is
that
you
it
was
it
was
also
she
it
was
marjorie
and
so
soon
as
i
saw
her
i
knew
that
there
was
only
one
woman
in
the
world
for
me
the
mere
sight
of
her
sent
the
blood
tingling
through
my
veins
turning
to
her
attendant
cavalier
she
dismissed
him
with
a
bow
there
an
empty
chair
she
seated
herself
in
the
one
miss
grayling
had
just
vacated
i
sat
down
beside
her
she
glanced
at
me
laughter
in
her
eyes
i
was
all
in
a
stupid
tremblement
remember
that
last
night
i
told
you
that
i
might
require
your
friendly
services
in
diplomatic
intervention
i
nodded
i
felt
that
the
allusion
was
unfair
the
occasion
come
or
at
least
it
very
near
she
was
still
and
i
said
nothing
to
help
her
know
how
unreasonable
papa
can
be
i
did
never
a
more
man
in
england
than
geoffrey
lindon
or
in
a
sense
a
duller
but
just
then
i
was
not
prepared
to
admit
it
to
his
child
know
what
an
absurd
objection
he
has
to
paul
there
was
an
appreciative
hesitation
before
she
uttered
the
christian
name
when
it
came
it
was
with
an
accent
of
tenderness
which
stung
me
like
a
gadfly
to
speak
to
me
of
all
men
of
the
fellow
in
such
a
tone
was
like
a
woman
mr
lindon
no
notion
of
how
things
stand
between
you
what
he
suspects
that
is
just
where
you
are
to
come
in
papa
thinks
so
much
of
you
i
want
you
to
sound
paul
praises
in
his
ear
to
prepare
him
for
what
must
come
was
ever
rejected
lover
burdened
with
such
a
task
its
enormity
kept
me
still
you
have
always
been
my
friend
my
truest
dearest
friend
when
i
was
a
little
girl
you
used
to
come
between
papa
and
me
to
shield
me
from
his
wrath
now
that
i
am
a
big
girl
i
want
you
to
be
on
my
side
once
more
and
to
shield
me
still
her
voice
softened
she
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
how
under
her
touch
i
burned
i
do
understand
what
cause
there
has
been
for
secrecy
why
should
there
have
been
any
secrecy
from
the
first
was
paul
wish
that
papa
should
not
be
told
mr
lessingham
ashamed
of
you
does
he
fear
your
father
are
unkind
you
know
perfectly
well
that
papa
has
been
prejudiced
against
him
all
along
you
know
that
his
political
position
is
just
now
one
of
the
greatest
difficulty
that
every
nerve
and
muscle
is
kept
on
the
continual
strain
that
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
essential
that
further
complications
of
every
and
any
sort
should
be
avoided
he
is
quite
aware
that
his
suit
will
not
be
approved
of
by
papa
and
he
simply
wishes
that
nothing
shall
be
said
about
it
till
the
end
of
the
session
that
is
see
mr
lessingham
is
cautious
even
in
politician
first
and
lover
afterwards
why
not
would
you
have
him
injure
the
cause
he
has
at
heart
for
want
of
a
little
patience
depends
what
cause
it
is
he
has
at
heart
is
the
matter
with
you
why
do
you
speak
to
me
like
that
it
is
not
like
you
at
all
she
looked
at
me
shrewdly
with
flashing
eyes
it
possible
that
you
are
jealous
that
you
were
in
earnest
in
what
you
said
last
night
i
thought
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
you
said
to
every
girl
i
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
take
her
in
my
arms
and
press
her
to
my
bosom
then
and
there
to
think
that
she
should
taunt
me
with
having
said
to
her
the
sort
of
thing
i
said
to
every
girl
do
you
know
of
mr
lessingham
all
the
world
knows
that
history
will
be
made
by
him
are
kinds
of
history
in
the
making
of
which
one
would
not
desire
to
be
associated
what
do
you
know
of
his
private
life
it
was
to
that
that
i
was
referring
you
go
too
far
i
know
that
he
is
one
of
the
best
just
as
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
men
for
me
that
is
sufficient
you
do
know
that
it
is
sufficient
do
know
it
all
the
world
knows
it
everyone
with
whom
he
comes
in
contact
is
aware
must
be
aware
that
he
is
incapable
of
a
dishonourable
thought
or
action
my
advice
do
appreciate
any
man
too
highly
in
the
book
of
every
man
life
there
is
a
page
which
he
would
wish
to
keep
turned
down
is
no
such
page
in
paul
there
may
be
in
yours
i
think
that
probable
you
i
fear
it
is
more
than
probable
i
fear
that
in
my
case
the
page
may
extend
to
several
there
is
nothing
apostolic
about
me
not
even
the
name
you
are
unendurable
it
is
the
more
strange
to
hear
you
talk
like
this
since
paul
regards
you
as
his
friend
flatters
me
you
not
his
friend
it
not
sufficient
to
be
yours
who
is
against
paul
is
against
me
is
hard
is
it
hard
who
is
against
the
husband
can
hardly
be
for
the
wife
when
the
husband
and
the
wife
are
one
as
yet
you
are
not
is
my
cause
so
hopeless
do
you
call
your
cause
are
you
thinking
of
that
nonsense
you
were
talking
about
last
night
she
laughed
call
it
you
ask
for
sympathy
and
give
so
much
will
give
you
all
the
sympathy
you
stand
in
need
of
i
promise
it
my
poor
dear
sydney
do
be
so
absurd
do
you
think
that
i
know
you
you
the
best
of
friends
and
the
worst
of
lovers
as
the
one
so
true
so
fickle
as
the
other
to
my
certain
knowledge
with
how
many
girls
have
you
been
in
love
and
out
again
it
is
true
that
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
you
have
never
been
in
love
with
me
before
but
that
the
merest
accident
believe
me
my
dear
dear
sydney
you
be
in
love
with
someone
else
tomorrow
if
you
not
there
i
confess
quite
frankly
that
in
that
direction
all
the
experience
i
have
had
of
you
has
in
nowise
strengthened
my
prophetic
instinct
cheer
up
one
never
knows
who
is
this
that
coming
it
was
dora
grayling
who
was
coming
i
went
off
with
her
without
a
word
we
were
through
the
dance
before
she
spoke
to
me
am
sorry
that
i
was
cross
to
you
just
now
and
disagreeable
somehow
i
always
seem
destined
to
show
to
you
my
most
unpleasant
side
blame
was
mine
what
sort
of
side
do
i
show
you
you
are
far
kinder
to
me
than
i
deserve
now
and
always
is
what
you
say
me
it
true
else
how
comes
it
that
at
this
time
of
day
i
without
a
friend
in
all
the
world
without
a
friend
i
never
knew
a
man
who
had
so
many
i
never
knew
a
person
of
whom
so
many
men
and
women
join
in
speaking
well
grayling
for
never
having
done
anything
worth
doing
think
of
what
you
have
done
think
of
your
discoveries
think
of
your
inventions
think
of
but
never
mind
the
world
knows
you
have
done
great
things
and
it
confidently
looks
to
you
to
do
still
greater
you
talk
of
being
friendless
and
yet
when
i
ask
as
a
favour
as
a
great
favour
to
be
allowed
to
do
something
to
show
my
friendship
you
well
you
snub
me
snub
you
know
you
snubbed
me
you
really
mean
that
you
take
an
interest
in
in
my
work
know
i
mean
it
she
turned
to
me
her
face
all
glowing
and
i
did
know
it
you
come
to
my
laboratory
morning
i
wo
i
your
aunt
with
my
aunt
show
you
round
and
tell
you
all
there
is
to
be
told
and
then
if
you
still
think
there
anything
in
it
i
accept
your
offer
about
that
south
american
experiment
that
is
if
it
still
holds
good
course
it
still
holds
good
we
be
partners
yes
we
will
be
partners
will
cost
a
terrific
sum
are
some
things
which
never
can
cost
too
much
not
my
experience
hope
it
will
be
mine
a
bargain
my
side
i
promise
you
that
it
a
bargain
when
i
got
outside
the
room
i
found
that
percy
woodville
was
at
my
side
his
round
face
was
in
a
manner
of
speaking
as
long
as
my
arm
he
took
his
glass
out
of
his
eye
and
rubbed
it
with
his
handkerchief
and
directly
he
put
it
back
he
took
it
out
and
rubbed
it
again
i
believe
that
i
never
saw
him
in
such
a
state
of
fluster
and
when
one
speaks
of
woodville
that
means
something
i
am
in
a
devil
of
a
stew
he
looked
it
of
a
heap
i
had
a
blow
which
i
shall
never
get
over
get
under
woodville
is
one
of
those
fellows
who
will
insist
on
telling
me
their
most
private
matters
even
to
what
they
owe
their
washerwomen
for
the
ruination
of
their
shirts
why
goodness
alone
can
tell
heaven
knows
i
am
not
sympathetic
be
an
idiot
you
do
know
what
i
suffering
i
as
nearly
as
possible
stark
mad
all
right
old
chap
i
seen
you
that
way
more
than
once
before
talk
like
that
you
not
a
perfect
brute
bet
you
a
shilling
that
i
am
torture
me
you
not
atherton
he
seized
me
by
the
lapels
of
my
coat
seeming
half
beside
himself
fortunately
he
had
drawn
me
into
a
recess
so
that
we
were
noticed
by
few
observers
do
you
think
has
happened
dear
chap
how
on
earth
am
i
to
know
refused
me
she
well
i
never
buck
up
try
some
other
address
there
are
quite
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
came
out
of
it
you
a
blackguard
he
had
crumpled
his
handkerchief
into
a
ball
and
was
actually
bobbing
at
his
eyes
with
it
the
idea
of
percy
woodville
being
dissolved
in
tears
was
excruciatingly
funny
but
just
then
i
could
hardly
tell
him
so
not
a
doubt
of
it
it
my
way
of
being
sympathetic
do
be
so
down
man
try
her
again
not
the
slightest
use
i
know
it
is
from
the
way
she
treated
me
be
so
sure
women
often
say
what
they
mean
least
who
the
lady
is
there
more
women
in
the
world
than
one
for
me
or
has
there
ever
been
you
ask
me
who
what
does
the
word
mean
to
me
but
marjorie
lindon
lindon
i
fancy
that
my
jaw
dropped
open
that
to
use
his
own
vernacular
i
was
of
a
heap
i
felt
like
it
i
strode
away
leaving
him
mazed
and
all
but
ran
into
marjorie
arms
just
leaving
will
you
see
me
to
the
carriage
mr
atherton
i
saw
her
to
the
carriage
you
off
can
i
give
you
a
lift
you
i
am
not
thinking
of
being
off
going
to
the
house
of
commons
wo
you
come
are
you
going
there
for
directly
she
spoke
of
it
i
knew
why
she
was
going
and
she
knew
that
i
knew
as
her
words
showed
are
quite
well
aware
of
what
the
magnet
is
you
are
not
so
ignorant
as
not
to
know
that
the
agricultural
amendment
act
is
on
and
that
paul
is
to
speak
i
always
try
to
be
there
when
paul
is
to
speak
and
i
mean
to
always
keep
on
trying
is
a
fortunate
man
and
again
indeed
a
man
with
such
gifts
as
his
is
inadequately
described
as
but
i
must
be
off
he
expected
to
be
up
before
but
i
heard
from
him
a
few
minutes
ago
that
there
has
been
a
delay
but
that
he
will
be
up
within
till
our
next
meeting
as
i
returned
into
the
house
in
the
hall
i
met
percy
woodville
he
had
his
hat
on
are
you

to

to
the
house

paul
lessingham
paul
lessingham

to
hear
paul
lessingham
marjorie
lindon
you
do
say
so
by
jove
i
say
atherton

wish
i
could
make
a
speech
i
never
can
when

have
to
have
my
speeches
written
for
me
and
then
i
have
to
read
but
by
jove
if
i
knew
miss
lindon
was
in
the
gallery
and
if
i
knew
anything
about
the
thing
or
could
get
someone
to
tell
me
something
hang
me
if
i
speak
i
show
her
i
not
the
fool
she
thinks
i
am
percy
speak
you
knock
silly
sir
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
come
with
you
i
to
the
house
as
well
paul
lessingham
shall
have
an
audience
of
three
chapter
xv
mr
lessingham
speaks
the
house
was
full
percy
and
i
went
upstairs
to
the
gallery
which
is
theoretically
supposed
to
be
reserved
for
what
are
called
strangers
those
curious
animals
trumperton
was
up
hammering
out
those
sentences
which
smell
not
so
much
of
the
lamp
as
of
the
dunderhead
nobody
was
listening
except
the
men
in
the
press
gallery
where
is
the
brain
of
the
house
and
ninety
per
cent
of
its
wisdom
it
was
not
till
trumperton
had
finished
that
i
discovered
lessingham
the
tedious
ancient
resumed
his
seat
amidst
a
murmur
of
sounds
which
i
have
no
doubt
some
of
the
interpreted
next
day
as
and
continued
applause
there
was
movement
in
the
house
possibly
expressive
of
relief
a
hum
of
voices
men
came
flocking
in
then
from
the
opposition
benches
there
rose
a
sound
which
was
applause
and
i
perceived
that
on
a
cross
bench
close
to
the
gangway
paul
lessingham
was
standing
up
bareheaded
i
eyed
him
critically
as
a
collector
might
eye
a
valuable
specimen
or
a
pathologist
a
curious
subject
during
the
last
four
and
twenty
hours
my
interest
in
him
had
grown
apace
just
then
to
me
he
was
the
most
interesting
man
the
world
contained
when
i
remembered
how
i
had
seen
him
that
same
morning
a
nerveless
wretch
grovelling
like
some
craven
cur
upon
the
floor
frightened
to
the
verge
of
imbecility
by
a
shadow
and
less
than
a
shadow
i
was
confronted
by
two
hypotheses
either
i
had
exaggerated
his
condition
then
or
i
exaggerated
his
condition
now
so
far
as
appearance
went
it
was
incredible
that
this
man
could
be
that
one
i
confess
that
my
feeling
rapidly
became
one
of
admiration
i
love
the
fighter
i
quickly
recognised
that
here
we
had
him
in
perfection
there
was
no
seeming
about
him
then
the
man
was
to
the
manner
born
to
his
a
fighting
man
i
had
never
realised
it
so
clearly
before
he
was
coolness
itself
he
had
all
his
faculties
under
complete
command
while
never
for
a
moment
really
exposing
himself
he
would
be
swift
in
perceiving
the
slightest
weakness
in
his
defence
and
so
soon
as
he
saw
it
like
lightning
he
would
slip
in
a
telling
blow
though
defeated
he
would
hardly
be
disgraced
and
one
might
easily
believe
that
their
very
victories
would
be
so
expensive
to
his
assailants
that
in
the
end
they
would
actually
conduce
to
his
own
triumph
me
i
told
myself
after
all
i
am
surprised
if
marjorie
does
see
something
in
him
for
i
perceived
how
a
clever
and
imaginative
young
woman
seeing
him
at
his
best
holding
his
own
like
a
gallant
knight
against
overwhelming
odds
in
the
lists
in
which
he
was
so
much
at
home
might
come
to
think
of
him
as
if
he
were
always
and
only
there
ignoring
altogether
the
kind
of
man
he
was
when
the
joust
was
finished
it
did
me
good
to
hear
him
i
do
know
that
and
i
could
easily
imagine
the
effect
he
had
on
one
particular
auditor
who
was
in
the
cage
it
was
very
far
from
being
an
in
the
american
sense
it
had
little
or
nothing
of
the
fire
and
fury
of
the
french
tribune
it
was
marked
neither
by
the
ponderosity
nor
the
sentiment
of
the
eloquent
german
yet
it
was
as
satisfying
as
are
the
efforts
of
either
of
the
three
producing
without
doubt
precisely
the
effect
which
the
speaker
intended
his
voice
was
clear
and
calm
not
exactly
musical
yet
distinctly
pleasant
and
it
was
so
managed
that
each
word
he
uttered
was
as
audible
to
every
person
present
as
if
it
had
been
addressed
particularly
to
him
his
sentences
were
short
and
crisp
the
words
which
he
used
were
not
big
ones
but
they
came
from
him
with
an
agreeable
ease
and
he
spoke
just
fast
enough
to
keep
one
interest
alert
without
invoking
a
strain
on
the
attention
he
commenced
by
making
in
the
quietest
and
most
courteous
manner
sarcastic
comments
on
the
speeches
and
methods
of
trumperton
and
his
friends
which
tickled
the
house
amazingly
but
he
did
not
make
the
mistake
of
pushing
his
personalities
too
far
to
a
speaker
of
a
certain
sort
nothing
is
easier
than
to
sting
to
madness
if
he
likes
his
every
word
is
barbed
wounds
so
given
fester
they
are
not
easily
forgiven
it
is
essential
to
a
politician
that
he
should
have
his
firmest
friends
among
the
fools
or
his
climbing
days
will
soon
be
over
soon
his
sarcasms
were
at
an
end
he
began
to
exchange
them
for
phrases
he
actually
began
to
say
pleasant
things
to
his
opponents
apparently
to
mean
them
to
put
them
in
a
good
conceit
with
themselves
he
pointed
out
how
much
truth
there
was
in
what
they
said
and
then
as
if
by
accident
with
what
ease
and
at
how
little
cost
amendments
might
be
made
he
found
their
arguments
and
took
them
for
his
own
and
flattered
them
whether
they
would
or
would
not
by
showing
how
firmly
they
were
founded
upon
fact
and
grafted
other
arguments
upon
them
which
seemed
their
natural
sequelae
and
transformed
them
and
drove
them
hither
and
thither
and
brought
them
their
own
arguments
to
a
round
irrefragable
conclusion
which
was
diametrically
the
reverse
of
that
to
which
they
themselves
had
brought
them
and
he
did
it
all
with
an
aptness
a
readiness
a
grace
which
was
incontestable
so
that
when
he
sat
down
he
had
performed
that
most
difficult
of
all
feats
he
had
delivered
what
in
a
house
of
commons
sense
was
a
practical
statesmanlike
speech
and
yet
one
which
left
his
hearers
in
an
excellent
humour
it
was
a
great
success
an
immense
success
a
parliamentary
triumph
of
almost
the
highest
order
paul
lessingham
had
been
coming
on
by
leaps
and
bounds
when
he
resumed
his
seat
amidst
applause
which
this
time
really
was
applause
there
were
probably
few
who
doubted
that
he
was
destined
to
go
still
farther
how
much
farther
it
is
true
that
time
alone
could
tell
but
so
far
as
appearances
went
all
the
prizes
which
are
as
the
crown
and
climax
of
a
statesman
career
were
well
within
his
reach
for
my
part
i
was
delighted
i
had
enjoyed
an
intellectual
exercise
a
species
of
enjoyment
not
so
common
as
it
might
be
the
apostle
had
almost
persuaded
me
that
the
political
game
was
one
worth
playing
and
that
its
triumphs
were
things
to
be
desired
it
is
something
after
all
to
be
able
to
appeal
successfully
to
the
passions
and
aspirations
of
your
peers
to
gain
their
plaudits
to
prove
your
skill
at
the
game
you
yourself
have
chosen
to
be
looked
up
to
and
admired
and
when
a
woman
eyes
look
down
on
you
and
her
ears
drink
in
your
every
word
and
her
heart
beats
time
with
yours
each
man
to
his
own
temperament
but
when
that
woman
is
the
woman
whom
you
love
to
know
that
your
triumph
means
her
glory
and
her
gladness
to
me
that
would
be
the
best
part
of
it
all
in
that
hour
the
apostle
hour
i
almost
wished
that
i
were
a
politician
too
the
division
was
over
the
business
of
the
night
was
practically
done
i
was
back
again
in
the
lobby
the
theme
of
conversation
was
the
apostle
speech
on
every
side
they
talked
of
it
suddenly
marjorie
was
at
my
side
her
face
was
glowing
i
never
saw
her
look
more
beautiful
or
happier
she
seemed
to
be
alone
you
have
come
after
all
was
it
splendid
was
it
magnificent
is
it
grand
to
have
such
great
gifts
and
to
use
them
to
such
good
purpose
speak
sydney
do
feign
a
coolness
which
is
foreign
to
your
nature
i
saw
that
she
was
hungry
for
me
to
praise
the
man
whom
she
delighted
to
honour
but
somehow
her
enthusiasm
cooled
mine
was
not
a
bad
speech
of
a
kind
a
kind
how
her
eyes
flashed
fire
with
what
disdain
she
treated
me
do
you
mean
by
of
a
kind
my
dear
sydney
are
you
not
aware
that
it
is
an
attribute
of
small
minds
to
attempt
to
belittle
those
which
are
greater
even
if
you
are
conscious
of
inferiority
unwise
to
show
it
mr
lessingham
was
a
great
speech
of
any
kind
your
incapacity
to
recognise
the
fact
simply
reveals
your
lack
of
the
critical
faculty
is
fortunate
for
mr
lessingham
that
there
is
at
least
one
person
in
whom
the
critical
faculty
is
so
bountifully
developed
apparently
in
your
judgment
he
who
discriminates
is
lost
i
thought
she
was
going
to
burst
into
passion
but
instead
laughing
she
placed
her
hand
upon
my
shoulder
sydney
i
understand
it
is
so
sad
do
you
know
you
are
like
a
little
boy
who
when
he
is
beaten
declares
that
the
victor
has
cheated
him
never
mind
as
you
grow
older
you
will
learn
better
she
stung
me
almost
beyond
bearing
i
cared
not
what
i
said
unless
i
am
mistaken
will
learn
better
before
you
are
older
do
you
mean
before
i
could
have
told
her
if
i
had
meant
to
tell
which
i
did
not
lessingham
came
up
hope
i
have
not
kept
you
waiting
i
have
been
delayed
longer
than
i
expected
at
all
though
i
am
quite
ready
to
get
away
it
a
little
tiresome
waiting
here
this
with
a
mischievous
glance
towards
me
a
glance
which
compelled
lessingham
to
notice
me
do
not
often
favour
us
do
i
find
better
employment
for
my
time
are
wrong
it
the
cant
of
the
day
to
underrate
the
house
of
commons
and
the
work
which
it
performs
do
you
suffer
yourself
to
join
in
the
chorus
of
the
simpletons
your
time
can
not
be
better
employed
than
in
endeavouring
to
improve
the
body
politic
am
obliged
to
i
hope
you
are
feeling
better
than
when
i
saw
you
last
a
gleam
came
into
his
eyes
fading
as
quickly
as
it
came
he
showed
no
other
sign
of
comprehension
surprise
or
resentment
i
am
very
well
marjorie
perceived
that
i
meant
more
than
met
the
eye
and
that
what
i
meant
was
meant
unpleasantly
let
us
be
off
it
is
mr
atherton
who
is
not
well
she
had
just
slipped
her
arm
through
lessingham
when
her
father
approached
old
lindon
stared
at
her
on
the
apostle
arm
as
if
he
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
she
thought
that
you
were
at
the
duchess
i
have
been
papa
and
now
i
here
old
lindon
began
to
stutter
and
stammer
and
to
grow
red
in
the
face
as
is
his
wont
when
at
all
excited
what
do
you
mean
by
here
wh
where
the
carriage
should
it
be
except
waiting
for
me
outside
unless
the
horses
have
run
away
i
i
take
you
down
to
it
i
i
do
approve
of
y
your
w
w
waiting
in
a
place
like
this
you
papa
but
mr
lessingham
is
going
to
take
me
i
shall
see
you
good
bye
anything
cooler
than
the
way
in
which
she
walked
off
i
do
not
think
i
ever
saw
this
is
the
age
of
feminine
advancement
young
women
think
nothing
of
twisting
their
mothers
round
their
fingers
let
alone
their
fathers
but
the
fashion
in
which
that
young
woman
walked
off
on
the
apostle
arm
and
left
her
father
standing
there
was
in
its
way
a
study
lindon
seemed
scarcely
able
to
realise
that
the
pair
of
them
had
gone
even
after
they
had
disappeared
in
the
crowd
he
stood
staring
after
them
growing
redder
and
redder
till
the
veins
stood
out
upon
his
face
and
i
thought
that
an
apoplectic
seizure
threatened
then
with
a
gasp
he
turned
to
me
scoundrel
i
took
it
for
granted
that
he
alluded
to
the
gentleman
even
though
his
following
words
hardly
suggested
it
this
morning
i
forbade
her
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
and
n
now
he
w
walked
off
with
her
c
confounded
adventurer
that
what
he
is
an
adventurer
and
before
many
hours
have
passed
i
take
the
liberty
to
tell
him
so
jamming
his
fists
into
his
pockets
and
puffing
like
a
grampus
in
distress
he
took
himself
away
and
it
was
time
he
did
for
his
words
were
as
audible
as
they
were
pointed
and
already
people
were
wondering
what
the
matter
was
woodville
came
up
as
lindon
was
going
just
as
sorely
distressed
as
ever
went
away
with
lessingham
did
you
see
her
course
i
saw
her
when
a
man
makes
a
speech
like
lessingham
any
girl
would
go
away
with
him
and
be
proud
to
when
you
are
endowed
with
such
great
powers
as
he
is
and
use
them
for
such
lofty
purposes
she
walk
away
with
you
but
till
then
never
he
was
at
his
old
trick
of
polishing
his
eyeglass
bitter
hard
when
i
knew
that
she
was
there
i
half
a
mind
to
make
a
speech
myself
upon
my
word
i
had
only
i
did
know
what
to
speak
about
and
i
ca
speak
anyhow
how
can
a
fellow
speak
when
he
shoved
into
the
gallery
you
say
how
can
he
he
ca
stand
on
the
railing
and
shout
even
with
a
friend
holding
him
behind
know
i
shall
speak
one
day
bound
to
and
then
she
wo
be
there
be
better
for
you
if
she
is
so
perhaps
you
right
i
be
safe
to
make
a
mess
of
it
and
then
if
she
were
to
see
me
at
it
it
be
the
devil
my
word
i
been
wishing
lately
i
was
clever
he
rubbed
his
nose
with
the
rim
of
his
eyeglass
looking
the
most
comically
disconsolate
figure
black
care
behind
you
percy
buck
up
my
boy
the
over
you
are
free
now
we
go
on
the
fly
and
we
did
on
the
fly
chapter
xvi
atherton
magic
vapour
i
bore
him
off
to
supper
at
the
helicon
all
the
way
in
the
cab
he
was
trying
to
tell
me
the
story
of
how
he
proposed
to
marjorie
and
he
was
very
far
from
being
through
with
it
when
we
reached
the
club
there
was
the
usual
crowd
of
supperites
but
we
got
a
little
table
to
ourselves
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
before
anything
was
brought
for
us
to
eat
he
was
at
it
again
a
good
many
of
the
people
were
pretty
near
to
shouting
and
as
they
seemed
to
be
all
speaking
at
once
and
the
band
was
playing
and
as
the
helicon
supper
band
is
not
piano
percy
did
not
have
it
quite
all
to
himself
but
considering
the
delicacy
of
his
subject
he
talked
as
loudly
as
was
decent
getting
more
so
as
he
went
on
but
percy
is
peculiar
do
know
how
many
times
i
tried
to
tell
her
over
and
over
again
you
now
pretty
near
every
time
i
met
her
but
i
never
seemed
to
get
quite
to
it
do
you
know
was
that
just
as
i
was
going
to
say
miss
lindon
may
i
offer
you
the
gift
of
my
affection
that
how
you
invariably
intended
to
begin
not
always
one
time
like
that
another
time
another
way
fact
is
i
got
off
a
little
speech
by
heart
but
i
never
got
a
chance
to
reel
it
off
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
just
say
anything
what
did
you
say
nothing
you
see
i
never
got
there
just
as
i
was
feeling
my
way
she
ask
me
if
i
preferred
big
sleeves
to
little
ones
or
top
hats
to
billycocks
or
some
nonsense
of
the
kind
she
now
of
course
i
had
to
answer
and
by
the
time
i
answered
the
chance
was
lost
percy
was
polishing
his
tried
to
get
there
so
many
times
and
she
choked
me
off
so
often
that
i
ca
help
thinking
that
she
suspected
what
it
was
that
i
was
after
think
she
did
must
have
done
once
i
followed
her
down
piccadilly
and
chivied
her
into
a
glove
shop
in
the
burlington
arcade
i
meant
to
propose
to
her
in
there
i
had
had
a
wink
of
sleep
all
night
through
dreaming
of
her
and
i
was
just
about
desperate
did
you
propose
girl
behind
the
counter
made
me
buy
a
dozen
pairs
of
gloves
instead
they
turned
out
to
be
three
sizes
too
large
for
me
when
they
came
home
i
believe
she
thought
i
gone
to
spoon
the
glove
girl
she
went
out
and
left
me
there
that
girl
loaded
me
with
all
sorts
of
things
when
she
was
gone
i
could
get
away
she
held
me
with
her
blessed
eye
i
believe
it
was
a
glass
one
linden
or
the
glove
girl
glove
girl
she
sent
me
home
a
whole
cartload
of
green
ties
and
declared
i
ordered
them
i
shall
never
forget
that
day
i
never
been
up
the
arcade
since
and
never
mean
to
gave
miss
lindon
a
wrong
impression
do
know
i
was
always
giving
her
wrong
impressions
once
she
said
that
she
knew
i
was
not
a
marrying
man
that
i
was
the
sort
of
chap
who
never
would
marry
because
she
saw
it
in
my
face
the
circumstances
that
was
trying
hard
percy
sighed
again
should
mind
if
i
was
so
gone
i
not
a
fellow
who
does
get
gone
but
when
i
do
get
gone
i
get
so
beastly
gone
tell
you
what
percy
have
a
drink
a
teetotaler
you
know
i
am
talk
of
your
heart
being
broken
and
of
your
being
a
teetotaler
in
the
same
breath
if
your
heart
were
really
broken
you
throw
teetotalism
to
the
winds
you
think
so
why
you
would
men
whose
hearts
are
broken
always
do
swallow
a
magnum
at
the
least
percy
groaned
i
drink
i
always
ill
but
i
have
a
try
he
had
a
try
making
a
good
beginning
by
emptying
at
a
draught
the
glass
which
the
waiter
had
just
now
filled
then
he
relapsed
into
melancholy
me
percy
honest
indian
do
you
really
love
her
her
his
eyes
grew
round
as
saucers
i
tell
you
that
i
love
her
know
you
tell
me
but
that
sort
of
thing
is
easy
telling
what
does
it
make
you
feel
like
this
love
you
talk
so
much
about
like
just
anyhow
and
nohow
you
should
look
inside
me
and
then
you
know
it
like
that
is
it
suppose
she
loved
another
man
what
sort
of
feeling
would
you
feel
towards
him
she
love
another
man
say
suppose
dare
say
she
does
i
expect
that
what
an
idiot
i
am
not
to
have
thought
of
that
before
he
sighed
and
refilled
his
glass
a
lucky
chap
whoever
he
is
i
i
like
to
tell
him
so
like
to
tell
him
so
such
a
jolly
lucky
chap
you
know
but
his
jolly
good
luck
is
your
jolly
bad
luck
would
you
be
willing
to
resign
her
to
him
without
a
word
she
loves
him
you
say
you
love
her
course
i
do
then
do
suppose
that
because
i
love
her
i
should
like
to
see
her
happy
i
not
such
a
beast
i
sooner
see
her
happy
than
anything
else
in
all
the
world
see
even
happy
with
another
i
afraid
that
my
philosophy
is
not
like
yours
if
i
loved
miss
lindon
and
she
loved
say
jones
afraid
i
should
feel
like
that
towards
jones
at
all
would
you
feel
like
percy
you
come
home
with
me
we
begun
the
night
together
let
end
it
together
and
i
show
you
one
of
the
finest
notions
for
committing
murder
on
a
scale
of
real
magnificence
you
ever
dreamed
of
i
should
like
to
make
use
of
it
to
show
my
feelings
towards
the
supposititious
jones
he
know
what
i
felt
for
him
when
once
he
had
been
introduced
to
it
percy
went
with
me
without
a
word
he
had
not
had
much
to
drink
but
it
had
been
too
much
for
him
and
he
was
in
a
condition
of
maundering
sentimentality
i
got
him
into
a
cab
we
dashed
along
piccadilly
he
was
silent
and
sat
looking
in
front
of
him
with
an
air
of
vacuous
sullenness
which
his
cast
of
countenance
i
bade
the
cabman
pass
though
lowndes
square
as
we
passed
the
apostle
i
pulled
him
up
i
pointed
out
the
place
to
woodville
see
percy
that
lessingham
house
that
the
house
of
the
man
who
went
away
with
marjorie
words
came
from
him
slowly
with
a
quite
unnecessary
stress
on
each
he
made
a
i
like
to
make
a
one
day
i
make
a
speech
he
made
a
speech
only
that
and
nothing
more
when
a
man
speaks
with
an
apostle
tongue
he
can
witch
any
woman
in
the
hallo
who
that
lessingham
is
that
you
i
saw
or
thought
i
saw
someone
or
something
glide
up
the
steps
and
withdraw
into
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
as
if
unwilling
to
be
seen
when
i
hailed
no
one
answered
i
called
again
be
shy
my
friend
i
sprang
out
of
the
cab
ran
across
the
pavement
and
up
the
steps
to
my
surprise
there
was
no
one
in
the
doorway
it
seemed
incredible
but
the
place
was
empty
i
felt
about
me
with
my
hands
as
if
i
had
been
playing
at
blind
man
buff
and
grasped
at
vacancy
i
came
down
a
step
or
two
there
a
vacuum
which
nature
i
say
driver
did
you
see
someone
come
up
the
steps
thought
i
did
sir
i
could
have
sworn
i
did
could
it
very
odd
whoever
it
was
has
gone
into
the
sir
do
see
how
we
should
have
heard
the
door
open
if
we
had
seen
it
and
we
should
have
seen
it
it
not
so
dark
as
i
half
a
mind
to
ring
the
bell
and
inquire
should
do
that
if
i
was
you
sir
you
jump
in
and
i
get
along
this
is
mr
lessingham
the
great
mr
lessingham
i
believe
the
cabman
thought
that
i
was
drunk
and
not
respectable
enough
to
claim
acquaintance
with
the
great
mr
lessingham
up
woodville
do
you
know
i
believe
there
some
mystery
about
this
place
i
feel
assured
of
it
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
the
presence
of
something
uncanny
something
which
i
can
neither
see
nor
touch
nor
hear
the
cabman
bent
down
from
his
seat
wheedling
me
in
sir
and
we
be
getting
along
i
jumped
in
and
we
got
along
but
not
far
before
we
had
gone
a
dozen
yards
i
was
out
again
without
troubling
the
driver
to
stop
he
pulled
up
aggrieved
sir
what
the
matter
now
you
be
damaging
yourself
before
you
done
and
then
you
be
blaming
me
i
had
caught
sight
of
a
cat
crouching
in
the
shadow
of
the
railings
a
black
one
that
cat
was
my
quarry
either
the
creature
was
unusually
sleepy
or
slow
or
stupid
or
it
had
lost
its
wits
which
a
cat
seldom
does
lose
anyhow
without
making
an
attempt
to
escape
it
allowed
me
to
grab
it
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
so
soon
as
we
were
inside
my
laboratory
i
put
the
cat
into
my
glass
box
percy
stared
have
you
put
it
there
for
my
dear
percy
is
what
you
are
shortly
about
to
see
you
are
about
to
be
the
witness
of
an
experiment
which
to
a
legislator
such
as
you
are
ought
to
be
of
the
greatest
possible
interest
i
am
going
to
demonstrate
on
a
small
scale
the
action
of
the
force
which
on
a
large
scale
i
propose
to
employ
on
behalf
of
my
native
land
he
showed
no
signs
of
being
interested
sinking
into
a
chair
he
recommenced
his
wearisome
reiteration
hate
cats
do
let
it
go
i
always
miserable
when
there
a
cat
in
the
room
that
your
fancy
what
you
want
a
taste
of
whisky
you
be
as
chirpy
as
a
cricket
do
want
anything
more
to
drink
i
had
too
much
already
i
paid
no
heed
to
what
he
said
i
poured
two
stiff
doses
into
a
couple
of
tumblers
without
seeming
to
be
aware
of
what
it
was
that
he
was
doing
he
disposed
of
the
better
half
of
the
one
i
gave
him
at
a
draught
putting
his
glass
upon
the
table
he
dropped
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
groaned
would
marjorie
think
of
me
if
she
saw
me
now
nothing
why
should
she
think
of
a
man
like
you
when
she
has
so
much
better
fish
to
fry
feeling
frightfully
ill
i
be
drunk
before
i
done
be
drunk
only
for
gracious
sake
be
lively
drunk
not
deadly
cheer
up
percy
i
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
almost
knocking
him
off
his
seat
on
to
the
floor
am
now
going
to
show
you
that
little
experiment
of
which
i
was
speaking
you
see
that
cat
course
i
see
it
the
beast
i
wish
you
let
it
go
should
i
let
it
go
do
you
know
whose
cat
that
is
that
paul
lessingham
lessingham
paul
lessingham
the
man
who
made
the
speech
the
man
whom
marjorie
went
away
with
do
you
know
it
his
do
know
it
is
but
i
believe
it
is
i
choose
to
believe
it
is
i
intend
to
believe
it
is
it
was
outside
his
house
therefore
it
his
cat
that
how
i
argue
i
ca
get
lessingham
inside
that
box
so
i
get
his
cat
instead
for
shall
you
observe
how
happy
it
is
do
seem
happy
all
our
ways
of
seeming
happy
that
its
way
the
creature
was
behaving
like
a
cat
gone
mad
dashing
itself
against
the
sides
of
its
glass
prison
leaping
to
and
fro
and
from
side
to
side
squealing
with
rage
or
with
terror
or
with
both
perhaps
it
foresaw
what
was
coming
there
is
no
fathoming
the
intelligence
of
what
we
call
the
lower
animals
a
funny
way
some
of
us
have
funny
ways
beside
cats
now
attention
observe
this
little
toy
you
seen
something
of
its
kind
before
it
a
spring
gun
you
pull
the
the
charge
into
the
barrel
release
the
spring
and
the
charge
is
fired
i
unlock
this
safe
which
is
built
into
the
wall
it
a
letter
lock
the
combination
just
now
is
whisky
you
see
that
a
hint
to
you
you
notice
the
safe
is
strongly
made
it
the
outer
casing
is
of
steel
the
contents
are
valuable
to
me
and
devilish
dangerous
i
pity
the
thief
who
in
his
innocent
ignorance
broke
in
to
steal
look
inside
you
see
full
of
balls
glass
balls
each
in
its
own
little
separate
nest
light
as
feathers
transparent
you
can
see
right
through
them
here
are
a
couple
like
tiny
pills
they
contain
neither
dynamite
nor
cordite
nor
anything
of
the
kind
yet
given
a
fair
field
and
no
favour
they
work
more
mischief
than
all
the
explosives
man
has
fashioned
take
hold
of
one
you
say
your
heart
is
broken
squeeze
this
under
your
nose
it
wants
but
a
gentle
pressure
and
in
less
time
than
no
time
you
be
in
the
land
where
they
say
there
are
no
broken
hearts
he
shrunk
back
do
know
what
you
talking
i
do
want
the
take
it
away
twice
the
chance
may
not
recur
tell
you
i
do
want
it
consider
course
i
sure
the
cat
shall
have
it
the
poor
brute
go
poor
brute
going
to
the
land
which
is
so
near
and
yet
so
far
once
more
if
you
please
attention
notice
what
i
do
with
this
toy
gun
i
pull
back
the
spring
i
insert
this
small
glass
pellet
i
thrust
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
through
the
opening
in
the
glass
box
which
contains
the
apostle
cat
you
observe
it
fits
quite
close
which
on
the
whole
is
perhaps
as
well
for
i
am
about
to
release
the
close
attention
notice
the
effect
let
the
brute
go
brute
gone
i
released
the
spring
the
pellet
has
been
discharged
it
has
struck
against
the
roof
of
the
glass
box
it
has
been
broken
by
the
contact
and
hey
presto
the
cat
lies
dead
and
that
in
face
of
its
nine
lives
you
perceive
how
still
it
is
how
still
let
hope
that
now
it
really
happy
the
cat
which
i
choose
to
believe
is
paul
lessingham
has
received
its
quietus
in
the
morning
i
send
it
back
to
him
with
my
respectful
compliments
miss
it
if
i
reflect
think
of
a
huge
bomb
filled
with
what
we
call
atherton
magic
vapour
fired
say
from
a
hundred
and
twenty
ton
gun
bursting
at
a
given
elevation
over
the
heads
of
an
opposing
force
properly
managed
in
less
than
an
instant
of
time
a
hundred
thousand
men
quite
possibly
more
would
drop
down
dead
as
if
smitten
by
the
lightning
of
the
skies
is
that
something
like
a
weapon
sir
not
well
i
want
to
get
away
i
wish
i
never
come
that
was
all
woodville
had
to
say
you
adding
to
your
stock
of
information
every
second
and
in
these
days
when
a
member
of
parliament
is
supposed
to
know
all
about
everything
information
the
one
thing
wanted
empty
your
glass
man
that
the
time
of
day
for
you
i
handed
him
his
tumbler
he
drained
what
was
left
of
its
contents
then
in
a
fit
of
tipsy
childish
temper
he
flung
the
tumbler
from
him
i
had
placed
carelessly
enough
the
second
pellet
within
a
foot
of
the
edge
of
the
table
the
shock
of
the
heavy
beaker
striking
the
board
close
to
it
set
it
rolling
i
was
at
the
other
side
i
started
forward
to
stop
its
motion
but
i
was
too
late
before
i
could
reach
the
crystal
globule
it
had
fallen
off
the
edge
of
the
table
on
to
the
floor
at
woodville
feet
and
smashed
in
falling
as
it
smashed
he
was
looking
down
wondering
no
doubt
in
his
stupidity
what
the
pother
was
about
for
i
was
shouting
and
making
something
of
a
clatter
in
my
efforts
to
prevent
the
catastrophe
which
i
saw
was
coming
on
the
instant
as
the
vapour
secreted
in
the
broken
pellet
gained
access
to
the
air
he
fell
forward
on
to
his
face
rushing
to
him
i
snatched
his
senseless
body
from
the
ground
and
dragged
it
staggeringly
towards
the
door
which
opened
on
to
the
yard
flinging
the
door
open
i
got
him
into
the
open
air
as
i
did
so
i
found
myself
confronted
by
someone
who
stood
outside
it
was
lessingham
mysterious
friend
my
visitor
chapter
xvii
magic
or
miracle
the
passage
into
the
yard
from
the
electrically
lit
laboratory
was
a
passage
from
brilliancy
to
gloom
the
shrouded
figure
standing
in
the
shadow
was
like
some
object
in
a
dream
my
own
senses
reeled
it
was
only
because
i
had
resolutely
held
my
breath
and
kept
my
face
averted
that
i
had
not
succumbed
to
the
fate
which
had
overtaken
woodville
had
i
been
a
moment
longer
in
gaining
the
open
air
it
would
have
been
too
late
as
it
was
in
placing
woodville
on
the
ground
i
stumbled
over
him
my
senses
left
me
even
as
they
went
i
was
conscious
of
exclaiming
remembering
the
saying
about
the
engineer
being
hoist
by
his
own
petard
magic
vapour
my
sensations
on
returning
to
consciousness
were
curious
i
found
myself
being
supported
in
someone
arms
a
stranger
face
was
bending
over
me
and
the
most
extraordinary
pair
of
eyes
i
had
ever
seen
were
looking
into
mine
the
deuce
are
you
i
asked
then
understanding
that
it
was
my
uninvited
visitor
with
scant
ceremony
i
drew
myself
away
from
him
by
the
light
which
was
streaming
through
the
laboratory
door
i
saw
that
woodville
was
lying
close
beside
me
stark
and
still
he
dead
i
cried
speak
man
it
not
so
bad
with
you
as
that
but
it
was
pretty
bad
so
bad
that
as
i
bent
down
and
looked
at
him
my
heart
beat
uncomfortably
fast
lest
it
was
as
bad
as
it
could
be
his
heart
seemed
still
the
vapour
took
effect
directly
on
the
cardiac
centres
to
revive
their
action
and
that
instantly
was
indispensable
yet
my
brain
was
in
such
a
whirl
that
i
could
not
even
think
of
how
to
set
about
beginning
had
i
been
alone
it
is
more
than
probable
woodville
would
have
died
as
i
stared
at
him
senselessly
aimlessly
the
stranger
passing
his
arms
beneath
his
body
extended
himself
at
full
length
upon
his
motionless
form
putting
his
lips
to
percy
he
seemed
to
be
pumping
life
from
his
own
body
into
the
unconscious
man
as
i
gazed
bewildered
surprised
presently
there
came
a
movement
of
percy
body
his
limbs
twitched
as
if
he
was
in
pain
by
degrees
the
motions
became
convulsive
till
on
a
sudden
he
bestirred
himself
to
such
effect
that
the
stranger
was
rolled
right
off
him
i
bent
down
to
find
that
the
young
gentleman
condition
still
seemed
very
far
from
satisfactory
there
was
a
rigidity
about
the
muscles
of
his
face
a
clamminess
about
his
skin
a
disagreeable
suggestiveness
about
the
way
in
which
his
teeth
and
the
whites
of
his
eyes
were
exposed
which
was
uncomfortable
to
contemplate
the
stranger
must
have
seen
what
was
passing
through
my
mind
not
a
very
difficult
thing
to
see
pointing
to
the
recumbent
percy
he
said
with
that
queer
foreign
twang
of
his
which
whatever
it
had
seemed
like
in
the
morning
sounded
musical
enough
just
then
will
be
well
with
him
am
not
so
sure
the
stranger
did
not
deign
to
answer
he
was
kneeling
on
one
side
of
the
victim
of
modern
science
i
on
the
other
passing
his
hand
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
unconscious
countenance
as
if
by
magic
all
semblance
of
discomfort
vanished
from
percy
features
and
to
all
appearances
he
was
placidly
asleep
you
hypnotised
him
does
it
matter
if
it
was
a
case
of
hypnotism
it
was
very
neatly
done
the
conditions
were
both
unusual
and
trying
the
effect
produced
seemed
all
that
could
be
desired
the
change
brought
about
in
half
a
dozen
seconds
was
quite
remarkable
i
began
to
be
aware
of
a
feeling
of
for
paul
lessingham
friend
his
morals
might
be
peculiar
and
manners
he
might
have
none
but
in
this
case
at
any
rate
the
end
seemed
to
have
justified
the
means
he
went
on
sleeps
when
he
awakes
he
will
remember
nothing
that
has
been
leave
him
the
night
is
warm
all
will
be
well
as
he
said
the
night
was
warm
and
it
was
dry
percy
would
come
to
little
harm
by
being
allowed
to
enjoy
for
a
while
the
pleasant
breezes
so
i
acted
on
the
stranger
advice
and
left
him
lying
in
the
yard
while
i
had
a
little
interview
with
the
impromptu
physician
chapter
xviii
the
apotheosis
of
the
beetle
the
laboratory
door
was
closed
the
stranger
was
standing
a
foot
or
two
away
from
it
i
was
further
within
the
room
and
was
subjecting
him
to
as
keen
a
scrutiny
as
circumstances
permitted
beyond
doubt
he
was
conscious
of
my
observation
yet
he
bore
himself
with
an
air
of
indifference
which
was
suggestive
of
perfect
unconcern
the
fellow
was
oriental
to
the
that
much
was
certain
yet
in
spite
of
a
pretty
wide
personal
knowledge
of
oriental
people
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
as
to
the
exact
part
of
the
east
from
which
he
came
he
was
hardly
an
arab
he
was
not
a
fellah
he
was
not
unless
i
erred
a
mohammedan
at
all
there
was
something
about
him
which
was
distinctly
not
mussulmanic
so
far
as
looks
were
concerned
he
was
not
a
flattering
example
of
his
race
whatever
his
race
might
be
the
portentous
size
of
his
nose
would
have
been
in
itself
sufficient
to
damn
him
in
any
court
of
beauty
his
lips
were
thick
and
shapeless
and
this
joined
to
another
peculiarity
in
his
appearance
seemed
to
suggest
that
in
his
veins
there
ran
more
than
a
streak
of
negro
blood
the
peculiarity
alluded
to
was
his
semblance
of
great
age
as
one
eyed
him
one
was
reminded
of
the
legends
told
of
people
who
have
been
supposed
to
have
retained
something
of
their
pristine
vigour
after
having
lived
for
centuries
as
however
one
continued
to
gaze
one
began
to
wonder
if
he
really
was
so
old
as
he
seemed
if
indeed
he
was
exceptionally
old
at
all
negroes
and
especially
negresses
are
apt
to
age
with
extreme
rapidity
among
coloured
folk
one
sometimes
encounters
women
whose
faces
seem
to
have
been
lined
by
the
passage
of
centuries
yet
whose
actual
tale
of
years
would
entitle
them
to
regard
themselves
here
in
england
as
in
the
prime
of
life
the
senility
of
the
fellow
countenance
besides
was
contradicted
by
the
juvenescence
of
his
eyes
no
really
old
man
could
have
had
eyes
like
that
they
were
curiously
shaped
reminding
me
of
the
elongated
faceted
eyes
of
some
queer
creature
with
whose
appearance
i
was
familiar
although
i
could
not
at
the
instant
recall
its
name
they
glowed
not
only
with
the
force
and
fire
but
also
with
the
frenzy
of
youth
more
eyes
i
had
never
encountered
their
possessor
could
not
be
in
any
sense
of
the
word
a
clubable
person
owing
probably
to
some
peculiar
formation
of
the
one
felt
as
one
met
his
gaze
that
he
was
looking
right
through
you
more
obvious
danger
signals
never
yet
were
placed
in
a
creature
head
the
individual
who
having
once
caught
sight
of
him
still
sought
to
cultivate
their
owner
acquaintance
had
only
himself
to
thank
if
the
very
worst
results
of
frequenting
evil
company
promptly
ensued
it
happens
that
i
am
myself
endowed
with
an
unusual
tenacity
of
vision
i
could
for
instance
easily
outstare
any
man
i
ever
met
yet
as
i
continued
to
stare
at
this
man
i
was
conscious
that
it
was
only
by
an
effort
of
will
that
i
was
able
to
resist
a
baleful
something
which
seemed
to
be
passing
from
his
eyes
to
mine
it
might
have
been
imagination
but
in
that
sense
i
am
not
an
imaginative
man
and
if
it
was
it
was
imagination
of
an
unpleasantly
vivid
kind
i
could
understand
how
in
the
case
of
a
nervous
or
a
sensitive
temperament
the
fellow
might
exercise
by
means
of
the
peculiar
quality
of
his
glance
alone
an
influence
of
a
most
disastrous
sort
which
given
an
appropriate
subject
in
the
manifestation
of
its
power
might
approach
almost
to
the
supernatural
if
ever
man
was
endowed
with
the
traditional
evil
eye
in
which
italians
among
modern
nations
are
such
profound
believers
it
was
he
when
we
had
stared
at
each
other
for
i
daresay
quite
five
minutes
i
began
to
think
i
had
had
about
enough
of
it
so
by
way
of
breaking
the
ice
i
put
to
him
a
question
i
ask
how
you
found
your
way
into
my
back
yard
he
did
not
reply
in
words
but
raising
his
hands
he
lowered
them
palms
downward
with
a
gesture
which
was
peculiarly
oriental
is
that
so
your
meaning
may
be
lucidity
itself
to
you
but
for
my
benefit
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
translating
it
into
words
once
more
i
ask
how
did
you
find
your
way
into
my
back
yard
again
nothing
but
the
gesture
you
are
not
sufficiently
acquainted
with
english
manners
and
customs
to
be
aware
that
you
have
placed
yourself
within
reach
of
the
pains
and
penalties
of
the
law
were
i
to
call
in
the
police
you
would
find
yourself
in
an
awkward
situation
and
unless
you
are
presently
more
explanatory
called
in
they
will
be
by
way
of
answer
he
indulged
in
a
distortion
of
the
countenance
which
might
have
been
meant
for
a
smile
and
which
seemed
to
suggest
that
he
regarded
the
police
with
a
contempt
which
was
too
great
for
words
do
you
laugh
do
you
think
that
being
threatened
with
the
police
is
a
joke
you
are
not
likely
to
find
it
have
you
suddenly
been
bereft
of
the
use
of
your
tongue
he
proved
that
he
had
not
by
using
it
have
still
the
use
of
my
tongue
at
least
is
something
perhaps
since
the
subject
of
how
you
got
into
my
back
yard
seems
to
be
a
delicate
one
you
will
tell
me
why
you
got
there
know
why
i
have
come
me
if
i
appear
to
flatly
contradict
you
but
that
is
precisely
what
i
do
not
know
do
know
i
then
in
that
case
i
presume
that
you
are
here
for
the
reason
which
appears
upon
the
surface
to
commit
a
felony
call
me
thief
else
are
you
am
no
you
know
why
i
have
come
he
raised
his
head
a
little
a
look
came
into
his
eyes
which
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
understand
yet
to
the
meaning
of
which
i
seemed
for
the
instant
to
have
mislaid
the
key
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
have
come
because
you
wanted
me
i
wanted
you
on
my
word
that
sublime
night
you
have
wanted
me
do
i
not
know
when
she
talked
to
you
of
him
and
the
blood
boiled
in
your
veins
when
he
spoke
and
all
the
people
listened
and
you
hated
him
because
he
had
honour
in
her
eyes
i
was
startled
either
he
meant
what
it
appeared
incredible
that
he
could
mean
or
there
was
confusion
somewhere
my
advice
my
friend
and
do
try
to
come
the
over
me
i
a
bit
in
that
line
myself
you
know
this
time
the
score
was
mine
he
was
puzzled
know
not
what
you
talk
of
that
case
we
equal
i
know
not
what
you
talk
of
either
his
manner
for
him
was
childlike
and
bland
is
it
you
do
not
know
this
morning
did
i
not
say
if
you
want
me
then
i
come
fancy
i
have
some
faint
recollection
of
your
being
so
good
as
to
say
something
of
the
kind
but
where
the
application
you
not
feel
for
him
the
same
as
i
the
him
lessingham
it
was
spoken
quietly
but
with
a
degree
of
to
put
it
gently
spitefulness
which
showed
that
at
least
the
will
to
do
the
apostle
harm
would
not
be
lacking
pray
what
is
the
common
feeling
which
we
have
for
him
plainly
with
this
gentleman
hate
meant
hate
in
the
solid
oriental
sense
i
should
hardly
have
been
surprised
if
the
mere
utterance
of
the
words
had
seared
his
lips
am
by
no
means
prepared
to
admit
that
i
have
this
feeling
which
you
attribute
to
me
but
even
granting
that
i
have
what
then
who
hate
are
kin
also
i
should
be
slow
to
admit
but
to
go
a
step
farther
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
your
presence
on
my
premises
at
this
hour
of
the
night
love
her
this
time
i
did
not
ask
him
to
supply
the
name
being
unwilling
that
it
should
be
soiled
by
the
traffic
of
his
lips
loves
him
that
is
not
well
if
you
choose
she
shall
love
you
that
will
be
well
and
pray
how
is
this
consummation
which
is
so
devoutly
to
be
desired
to
be
brought
about
your
hand
into
mine
say
that
you
wish
it
it
shall
be
done
moving
a
step
forward
he
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
me
i
hesitated
there
was
that
in
the
fellow
manner
which
for
the
moment
had
for
me
an
unwholesome
fascination
memories
flashed
through
my
mind
of
stupid
stories
which
have
been
told
of
compacts
made
with
the
devil
i
almost
felt
as
if
i
was
standing
in
the
actual
presence
of
one
of
the
powers
of
evil
i
thought
of
my
love
for
marjorie
which
had
revealed
itself
after
all
these
years
of
the
delight
of
holding
her
in
my
arms
of
feeling
the
pressure
of
her
lips
to
mine
as
my
gaze
met
his
the
lower
side
of
what
the
conquest
of
this
fair
lady
would
mean
burned
in
my
brain
fierce
imaginings
blazed
before
my
eyes
to
win
her
only
to
win
her
what
nonsense
he
was
talking
what
empty
brag
it
was
suppose
just
for
the
sake
of
the
joke
i
did
put
my
hand
in
his
and
did
wish
right
out
what
it
was
plain
he
knew
if
i
wished
what
harm
would
it
do
it
would
be
the
purest
jest
out
of
his
own
mouth
he
would
be
confounded
for
it
was
certain
that
nothing
would
come
of
it
why
should
i
not
do
it
then
i
would
act
on
his
suggestion
i
would
carry
the
thing
right
through
already
i
was
advancing
towards
him
when
i
stopped
i
do
know
why
on
the
instant
my
thoughts
went
off
at
a
tangent
what
sort
of
a
blackguard
did
i
call
myself
that
i
should
take
a
woman
name
in
vain
for
the
sake
of
playing
fool
tricks
with
such
scum
of
the
earth
as
the
hideous
vagabond
in
front
of
me
and
that
the
name
of
the
woman
whom
i
loved
rage
took
hold
of
me
hound
i
cried
in
my
sudden
passage
from
one
mood
to
another
i
was
filled
with
the
desire
to
shake
the
life
half
out
of
him
but
so
soon
as
i
moved
a
step
in
his
direction
intending
war
instead
of
peace
he
altered
the
position
of
his
hand
holding
it
out
towards
me
as
if
forbidding
my
approach
directly
he
did
so
quite
involuntarily
i
pulled
up
dead
as
if
my
progress
had
been
stayed
by
bars
of
iron
and
walls
of
steel
for
the
moment
i
was
astonished
to
the
verge
of
stupefaction
the
sensation
was
peculiar
i
was
as
incapable
of
advancing
another
inch
in
his
direction
as
if
i
had
lost
the
use
of
my
limbs
i
was
even
incapable
of
attempting
to
attempt
to
advance
at
first
i
could
only
stare
and
gape
presently
i
began
to
have
an
inkling
of
what
had
happened
the
scoundrel
had
almost
succeeded
in
hypnotising
me
that
was
a
nice
thing
to
happen
to
a
man
of
my
sort
at
my
time
of
life
a
shiver
went
down
my
back
what
might
have
occurred
if
i
had
not
pulled
up
in
time
what
pranks
might
a
creature
of
that
character
not
have
been
disposed
to
play
it
was
the
old
story
of
the
peril
of
playing
with
edged
tools
i
had
made
the
dangerous
mistake
of
underrating
the
enemy
strength
evidently
in
his
own
line
the
fellow
was
altogether
something
out
of
the
usual
way
i
believe
that
even
as
it
was
he
thought
he
had
me
as
i
turned
away
and
leaned
against
the
table
at
my
back
i
fancy
that
he
shivered
as
if
this
proof
of
my
being
still
my
own
master
was
unexpected
i
was
silent
it
took
some
seconds
to
enable
me
to
recover
from
the
shock
of
the
discovery
of
the
peril
in
which
i
had
been
standing
then
i
resolved
that
i
would
endeavour
to
do
something
which
should
make
me
equal
to
this
gentleman
of
many
talents
my
advice
my
friend
and
do
attempt
to
play
that
hankey
pankey
off
on
to
me
again
do
know
what
you
talk
of
lie
to
me
or
i
burn
you
into
ashes
behind
me
was
an
electrical
machine
giving
an
eighteen
inch
spark
it
was
set
in
motion
by
a
lever
fitted
into
the
table
which
i
could
easily
reach
from
where
i
sat
as
i
spoke
the
visitor
was
treated
to
a
little
exhibition
of
electricity
the
change
in
his
bearing
was
amusing
he
shook
with
terror
he
salaamed
down
to
the
ground
lord
my
lord
have
mercy
oh
my
lord
you
be
careful
that
all
you
may
suppose
yourself
to
be
something
of
a
magician
but
it
happens
unfortunately
for
you
that
i
can
do
a
bit
in
that
line
myself
perhaps
i
a
trifle
better
at
the
game
than
you
are
especially
as
you
have
ventured
into
my
stronghold
which
contains
magic
enough
to
make
a
show
of
a
hundred
thousand
such
as
you
taking
down
a
bottle
from
a
shelf
i
sprinkled
a
drop
or
two
of
its
contents
on
the
floor
immediately
flames
arose
accompanied
by
a
blinding
vapour
it
was
a
sufficiently
simple
illustration
of
one
of
the
qualities
of
but
its
effect
upon
my
visitor
was
as
startling
as
it
was
unexpected
if
i
could
believe
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyesight
in
the
very
act
of
giving
utterance
to
a
scream
of
terror
he
disappeared
how
or
why
or
whither
there
was
nothing
to
show
in
his
place
where
he
had
been
standing
there
seemed
to
be
a
dim
object
of
some
sort
in
a
state
of
frenzied
agitation
on
the
floor
the
phosphorescent
vapour
was
confusing
the
lights
appeared
to
be
suddenly
burning
low
before
i
had
sense
enough
to
go
and
see
if
there
was
anything
there
and
if
so
what
the
flames
had
vanished
the
man
himself
had
reappeared
and
prostrated
on
his
knees
was
salaaming
in
a
condition
of
abject
terror
lord
my
lord
he
whined
entreat
you
my
lord
to
use
me
as
your
slave
use
you
as
my
slave
whether
he
or
i
was
the
more
agitated
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
but
at
least
it
would
not
have
done
to
betray
my
feelings
as
he
did
his
up
he
stood
up
i
eyed
him
as
he
did
with
an
interest
which
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
was
of
a
distinctly
new
and
original
sort
whether
or
not
i
had
been
the
victim
of
an
ocular
delusion
i
could
not
be
sure
it
was
incredible
to
suppose
that
he
could
have
disappeared
as
he
had
seemed
to
disappear
it
was
also
incredible
that
i
could
have
imagined
his
disappearance
if
the
thing
had
been
a
trick
i
had
not
the
faintest
notion
how
it
had
been
worked
and
if
it
was
not
a
trick
then
what
was
it
was
it
something
new
in
scientific
marvels
could
he
give
me
as
much
instruction
in
the
qualities
of
unknown
forces
as
i
could
him
in
the
meanwhile
he
stood
in
an
attitude
of
complete
submission
with
downcast
eyes
and
hands
crossed
upon
his
breast
i
started
to
him
am
going
to
ask
you
some
questions
so
long
as
you
answer
them
promptly
truthfully
you
will
be
safe
otherwise
you
had
best
beware
oh
my
lord
is
the
nature
of
your
objection
to
mr
lessingham
has
he
done
to
you
that
you
should
wish
to
be
revenged
on
him
is
the
feud
of
the
innocent
blood
do
you
mean
by
that
his
hands
is
the
blood
of
my
kin
it
cries
aloud
for
vengeance
has
he
killed
my
lord
is
for
me
and
for
him
am
i
to
understand
that
you
do
not
choose
to
answer
me
and
that
i
am
again
to
use
my
magic
i
saw
that
he
quivered
lord
he
has
spilled
the
blood
of
her
who
has
lain
upon
his
breast
i
hesitated
what
he
meant
appeared
clear
enough
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
not
to
press
for
further
details
the
words
pointed
to
what
it
might
be
courteous
to
call
an
eastern
romance
though
it
was
hard
to
conceive
of
the
apostle
figuring
as
the
hero
of
such
a
theme
it
was
the
old
tale
retold
that
to
the
life
of
every
man
there
is
a
background
that
it
is
precisely
in
the
unlikeliest
cases
that
the
background
darkest
what
would
that
bogey
the
nonconformist
conscience
make
of
such
a
story
if
it
were
blazoned
through
the
land
would
paul
not
come
down
with
a
run
spilling
blood
is
a
figure
of
speech
pretty
perhaps
but
vague
if
you
mean
that
mr
lessingham
has
been
killing
someone
your
surest
and
most
effectual
revenge
would
be
gained
by
an
appeal
to
the
law
has
the
englishman
law
to
do
with
me
you
can
prove
that
he
has
been
guilty
of
murder
it
would
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
you
i
assure
you
that
at
any
rate
in
that
sense
the
englishman
law
is
no
respecter
of
persons
show
him
to
be
guilty
and
it
would
hang
paul
lessingham
as
indifferently
and
as
cheerfully
as
it
would
hang
bill
brown
that
so
is
so
as
if
you
choose
you
will
be
easily
able
to
prove
to
your
own
entire
satisfaction
he
had
raised
his
head
and
was
looking
at
something
which
he
seemed
to
see
in
front
of
him
with
a
maleficent
glare
in
his
sensitive
eyes
which
it
was
not
nice
to
see
would
be
shamed
he
would
be
shamed
all
men
all
men
and
i
take
it
before
all
women
too
he
would
hang
shown
to
have
been
guilty
of
wilful
murder
yes
his
hideous
face
was
lighted
up
by
a
sort
of
diabolical
exultation
which
made
it
if
that
were
possible
more
hideous
still
i
had
apparently
given
him
a
wrinkle
which
pleased
him
most
consummately
i
will
do
that
in
the
end
in
the
end
he
opened
his
eyes
to
their
widest
limits
then
shut
them
tight
as
if
to
gloat
on
the
picture
which
his
fancy
painted
then
reopened
them
the
meantime
i
will
have
vengeance
in
my
own
fashion
he
knows
already
that
the
avenger
is
upon
him
he
has
good
reason
to
know
it
and
through
the
days
and
the
nights
the
knowledge
shall
be
with
him
still
and
it
shall
be
to
him
as
the
bitterness
of
death
aye
of
many
deaths
for
he
will
know
that
escape
there
is
none
and
that
for
him
there
shall
be
no
more
sun
in
the
sky
and
that
the
terror
shall
be
with
him
by
night
and
by
day
at
his
rising
up
and
at
his
lying
down
wherever
his
eyes
shall
turn
it
shall
be
there
yet
behold
the
sap
and
the
juice
of
my
vengeance
is
in
this
in
that
though
he
shall
be
very
sure
that
the
days
that
are
are
as
the
days
of
his
death
yet
shall
he
know
that
the
death
the
great
death
is
coming
coming
and
shall
be
on
him
when
i
will
the
fellow
spoke
like
an
inspired
maniac
if
he
meant
half
what
he
said
and
if
he
did
not
then
his
looks
and
his
tones
belied
him
then
a
promising
future
bade
fair
to
be
in
store
for
mr
lessingham
and
also
circumstances
being
as
they
were
for
marjorie
it
was
this
latter
reflection
which
gave
me
pause
either
this
imprecatory
fanatic
would
have
to
be
disposed
of
by
lessingham
himself
or
by
someone
acting
on
his
behalf
and
so
far
as
their
power
of
doing
mischief
went
his
big
words
proved
empty
windbags
or
marjorie
would
have
to
be
warned
that
there
was
at
least
one
passage
in
her
suitor
life
into
which
ere
it
was
too
late
it
was
advisable
that
inquiry
should
be
made
to
allow
marjorie
to
irrevocably
link
her
fate
with
the
apostle
without
being
first
of
all
made
aware
that
he
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
haunted
man
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
employ
large
phrases
my
words
cooled
the
other
heated
blood
once
more
his
eyes
were
cast
down
his
hands
crossed
upon
his
breast
crave
my
lord
pardon
my
wound
is
ever
new
the
way
what
was
the
secret
history
this
morning
of
that
little
incident
of
the
cockroach
he
glanced
up
quickly
i
know
not
what
you
say
was
it
beetle
then
he
seemed
all
at
once
to
have
lost
his
voice
the
word
was
gasped
you
went
we
found
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
a
capitally
executed
drawing
of
a
beetle
which
i
fancy
you
must
have
left
behind
you
scaraboeus
sacer
was
it
know
not
what
you
talk
of
discovery
seemed
to
have
quite
a
singular
effect
on
mr
lessingham
now
why
was
that
know
nothing
yes
you
do
and
before
you
go
i
mean
to
know
something
too
the
man
was
trembling
looking
this
way
and
that
showing
signs
of
marked
discomfiture
that
there
was
something
about
that
ancient
scarab
which
figures
so
largely
in
the
still
unravelled
tangles
of
the
egyptian
mythologies
and
the
effect
which
the
mere
sight
of
its
cartouch
for
the
drawing
had
resembled
something
of
the
kind
had
had
on
such
a
seasoned
vessel
as
paul
lessingham
which
might
be
well
worth
my
finding
out
i
felt
convinced
the
man
demeanour
on
my
recurring
to
the
matter
told
its
own
plain
tale
i
made
up
my
mind
if
possible
to
probe
the
business
to
the
bottom
then
and
there
to
me
my
friend
i
am
a
plain
man
and
i
use
plain
speech
it
a
kind
of
hobby
i
have
you
will
give
me
the
information
i
require
and
that
at
once
or
i
will
pit
my
magic
against
yours
in
which
case
i
think
it
extremely
probable
that
you
will
come
off
worst
from
the
encounter
i
reached
out
for
the
lever
and
the
exhibition
of
electricity
recommenced
immediately
his
tremors
were
redoubled
lord
i
know
not
of
what
you
talk
of
your
lies
for
tell
me
why
at
the
sight
of
the
thing
on
that
sheet
of
paper
paul
lessingham
went
green
and
yellow
him
my
lord
later
on
that
is
what
i
shall
do
in
the
meantime
i
am
asking
you
answer
or
look
out
for
squalls
the
electrical
exhibition
was
going
on
he
was
glaring
at
it
as
if
he
wished
that
it
would
stop
as
if
ashamed
of
his
cowardice
plainly
on
a
sudden
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
get
the
better
of
his
fears
and
succeeded
better
than
i
had
expected
or
desired
he
drew
himself
up
with
what
in
him
amounted
to
an
air
of
dignity
am
a
child
of
isis
it
struck
me
that
he
made
this
remark
not
so
much
to
impress
me
as
with
a
view
of
elevating
his
own
low
spirits
you
then
in
that
case
i
regret
that
i
am
unable
to
congratulate
the
lady
on
her
offspring
when
i
said
that
a
ring
came
into
his
voice
which
i
had
not
heard
before
you
know
not
of
what
you
speak
i
warn
you
as
i
warned
paul
lessingham
be
careful
not
to
go
too
far
be
not
like
him
heed
my
warning
is
it
i
am
being
warned
against
the
beetle
the
beetle
were
i
upon
oath
and
this
statement
being
made
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
say
in
a
solicitor
office
i
standing
in
fear
of
pains
and
penalties
i
think
that
at
this
point
i
should
leave
the
paper
blank
no
man
likes
to
own
himself
a
fool
or
that
he
ever
was
a
fool
and
ever
since
i
have
been
wondering
whether
on
that
occasion
that
of
isis
did
or
did
not
play
the
fool
with
me
his
performance
was
realistic
enough
at
the
time
heaven
knows
but
as
it
gets
farther
and
farther
away
i
ask
myself
more
and
more
confidently
as
time
effluxes
whether
after
all
it
was
not
clever
juggling
superhumanly
clever
juggling
if
you
will
that
and
nothing
more
if
it
was
something
more
then
with
a
vengeance
there
is
more
in
heaven
and
earth
than
is
dreamed
of
in
our
philosophy
the
mere
possibility
opens
vistas
which
the
sane
mind
fears
to
contemplate
since
then
i
am
not
on
oath
and
should
i
fall
short
of
verbal
accuracy
i
do
not
need
to
fear
the
engines
of
the
law
what
seemed
to
happen
was
this
he
was
standing
within
about
ten
feet
of
where
i
leaned
against
the
edge
of
the
table
the
light
was
full
on
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
suppose
that
i
could
make
a
mistake
as
to
what
took
place
in
front
of
me
as
he
replied
to
my
mocking
allusion
to
the
beetle
by
echoing
my
own
words
he
vanished
or
rather
i
saw
him
taking
a
different
shape
before
my
eyes
his
loose
draperies
all
fell
off
him
and
as
they
were
in
the
very
act
of
falling
there
issued
or
there
seemed
to
issue
out
of
them
a
monstrous
creature
of
the
beetle
type
the
man
himself
was
gone
on
the
point
of
size
i
wish
to
make
myself
clear
my
impression
when
i
saw
it
first
was
that
it
was
as
large
as
the
man
had
been
and
that
it
was
in
some
way
standing
up
on
end
the
legs
towards
me
but
the
moment
it
came
in
view
it
began
to
dwindle
and
that
so
rapidly
that
in
a
couple
of
seconds
at
most
a
little
heap
of
drapery
was
lying
on
the
floor
on
which
was
a
truly
astonishing
example
of
the
coleoptera
it
appeared
to
be
a
beetle
it
was
perhaps
six
or
seven
inches
high
and
about
a
foot
in
length
its
scales
were
of
a
vivid
golden
green
i
could
distinctly
see
where
the
wings
were
sheathed
along
the
back
and
as
they
seemed
to
be
slightly
agitated
i
looked
every
moment
to
see
them
opened
and
the
thing
take
wing
i
was
so
astonished
as
who
would
not
have
been
that
for
an
appreciable
space
of
time
i
was
practically
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
i
could
do
nothing
but
stare
i
was
acquainted
with
the
legendary
transmigrations
of
isis
and
with
the
story
of
the
beetle
which
issues
from
the
woman
womb
through
all
eternity
and
with
the
other
pretty
tales
but
this
of
which
i
was
an
actual
spectator
was
something
new
even
in
legends
if
the
man
with
whom
i
had
just
been
speaking
was
gone
where
had
he
gone
to
if
this
glittering
creature
was
there
in
his
stead
whence
had
it
come
i
do
protest
this
much
that
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
had
passed
i
retained
my
presence
of
mind
i
felt
as
an
investigator
might
feel
who
has
stumbled
haphazard
on
some
astounding
some
discovery
i
was
conscious
that
i
should
have
to
make
the
best
use
of
my
mental
faculties
if
i
was
to
take
full
advantage
of
so
astonishing
an
accident
i
kept
my
glance
riveted
on
the
creature
with
the
idea
of
photographing
it
on
my
brain
i
believe
that
if
it
were
possible
to
take
a
retinal
print
which
it
someday
will
be
you
would
have
a
perfect
picture
of
what
it
was
i
saw
beyond
doubt
it
was
a
lamellicorn
one
of
the
copridae
with
the
one
exception
of
its
monstrous
size
there
were
the
characteristics
in
plain
view
the
convex
body
the
large
head
the
projecting
clypeus
more
its
smooth
head
and
throat
seemed
to
suggest
that
it
was
a
female
equally
beyond
a
doubt
apart
from
its
size
there
were
unusual
features
present
too
the
eyes
were
not
only
unwontedly
conspicuous
they
gleamed
as
if
they
were
lighted
by
internal
flames
in
some
indescribable
fashion
they
reminded
me
of
my
vanished
visitor
the
colouring
was
superb
and
the
creature
appeared
to
have
the
faculty
of
lightening
and
darkening
the
shades
at
will
its
not
least
curious
feature
was
its
restlessness
it
was
in
a
state
of
continual
agitation
and
as
if
it
resented
my
inspection
the
more
i
looked
at
it
the
more
its
agitation
grew
as
i
have
said
i
expected
every
moment
to
see
it
take
wing
and
circle
through
the
air
all
the
while
i
was
casting
about
in
my
mind
as
to
what
means
i
could
use
to
effect
its
capture
i
did
think
of
killing
it
and
on
the
whole
i
rather
wish
that
i
had
at
any
rate
attempted
slaughter
there
were
dozens
of
things
lying
ready
to
my
hand
any
one
of
which
would
have
severely
tried
its
constitution
but
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
the
only
method
of
taking
it
alive
which
occurred
to
me
was
to
pop
over
it
a
big
tin
canister
which
had
contained
this
canister
was
on
the
floor
to
my
left
i
moved
towards
it
as
nonchalantly
as
i
could
keeping
an
eye
on
that
shining
wonder
all
the
time
directly
i
moved
its
agitation
perceptibly
increased
it
was
so
to
speak
all
one
whirr
of
tremblement
it
scintillated
as
if
its
coloured
scales
had
been
so
many
prisms
it
began
to
unsheath
its
wings
as
if
it
had
finally
decided
that
it
would
make
use
of
them
picking
up
the
tin
disembarrassing
it
of
its
lid
i
sprang
towards
my
intended
victim
its
wings
opened
wide
obviously
it
was
about
to
rise
but
it
was
too
late
before
it
had
cleared
the
ground
the
tin
was
over
it
it
remained
over
it
however
for
an
instant
only
i
had
stumbled
in
my
haste
and
in
my
effort
to
save
myself
from
falling
face
foremost
on
to
the
floor
i
was
compelled
to
remove
my
hands
from
the
tin
before
i
was
able
to
replace
them
the
tin
was
sent
flying
and
while
i
was
still
partially
recumbent
within
eighteen
inches
of
me
that
beetle
swelled
and
swelled
until
it
had
assumed
its
former
portentous
dimensions
when
as
it
seemed
it
was
enveloped
by
a
human
shape
and
in
less
time
than
no
time
there
stood
in
front
of
me
naked
from
top
to
toe
my
truly
versatile
oriental
friend
one
startling
fact
nudity
revealed
that
i
had
been
egregiously
mistaken
on
the
question
of
sex
my
visitor
was
not
a
man
but
a
woman
and
judging
from
the
brief
glimpse
which
i
had
of
her
body
by
no
means
old
or
either
if
that
transformation
was
not
a
bewildering
one
then
two
and
two
make
five
the
most
scientist
would
temporarily
have
lost
his
mental
equipoise
on
witnessing
such
a
quick
change
as
that
within
a
span
or
two
of
his
own
nose
i
was
not
only
witless
i
was
breathless
too
i
could
only
gape
and
while
i
gaped
the
woman
stooping
down
picking
up
her
draperies
began
to
huddle
them
on
her
anyhow
and
also
to
skeddadle
towards
the
door
which
led
into
the
yard
when
i
observed
this
last
manoeuvre
to
some
extent
i
did
rise
to
the
requirements
of
the
situation
leaping
up
i
rushed
to
stay
her
flight
i
shouted
but
she
was
too
quick
for
me
ere
i
could
reach
her
she
had
opened
the
door
and
was
through
it
and
what
was
more
she
had
slammed
it
in
my
face
in
my
excitement
i
did
some
fumbling
with
the
handle
when
in
my
turn
i
was
in
the
yard
she
was
out
of
sight
i
did
fancy
i
saw
a
dim
form
disappearing
over
the
wall
at
the
further
side
and
i
made
for
it
as
fast
as
i
knew
how
i
clambered
on
to
the
wall
looking
this
way
and
that
but
there
was
nothing
and
no
one
to
be
seen
i
listened
for
the
sound
of
retreating
footsteps
but
all
was
still
apparently
i
had
the
entire
neighbourhood
to
my
own
sweet
self
my
visitor
had
vanished
time
devoted
to
pursuit
i
felt
would
be
time
as
i
returned
across
the
yard
woodville
who
still
was
taking
his
rest
under
the
open
canopy
of
heaven
sat
up
seemingly
my
approach
had
roused
him
out
of
slumber
at
sight
of
me
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
yawned
and
blinked
say
he
remarked
not
at
all
unreasonably
am
i
on
holy
or
on
haunted
ground
hang
me
if
i
quite
know
which
but
that
where
you
are
my
boy
jove
i
am
feeling
queer
i
have
got
a
headache
do
you
know
should
be
in
the
least
surprised
at
anything
you
have
or
have
i
beyond
surprise
it
a
drop
of
whisky
you
are
wanting
and
what
i
wanting
too
only
for
goodness
sake
drop
me
none
of
your
drops
mine
is
a
case
for
a
bottle
at
the
least
i
put
my
arm
through
his
and
went
with
him
into
the
laboratory
and
when
we
were
in
i
shut
and
locked
and
barred
the
door
chapter
xix
the
lady
rages
dora
grayling
stood
in
the
doorway
told
your
servant
he
need
not
trouble
to
show
me
in
and
i
come
without
my
aunt
i
hope
i
not
intruding
she
was
confoundedly
and
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
tell
her
so
she
came
into
the
room
with
twinkling
eyes
looking
radiantly
happy
that
sort
of
look
which
makes
even
a
plain
young
woman
prepossessing
i
intruding
i
believe
i
am
she
held
out
her
hand
while
she
was
still
a
dozen
feet
away
and
when
i
did
not
at
once
dash
forward
to
make
a
clutch
at
it
she
shook
her
head
and
made
a
little
mouth
at
me
the
matter
with
you
are
you
well
i
was
not
well
i
was
very
far
from
well
i
was
as
unwell
as
i
could
be
without
being
positively
ill
and
any
person
of
common
discernment
would
have
perceived
it
at
a
glance
at
the
same
time
i
was
not
going
to
admit
anything
of
the
kind
to
her
you
i
am
perfectly
well
if
i
were
you
i
would
endeavour
to
become
imperfectly
well
a
little
imperfection
in
that
direction
might
make
you
appear
to
more
advantage
am
afraid
that
that
i
am
not
one
of
those
persons
who
ever
do
appear
to
much
advantage
did
i
not
tell
you
so
last
night
believe
you
did
say
something
of
the
kind
it
very
good
of
you
to
remember
have
you
forgotten
something
else
which
you
said
to
me
last
night
can
hardly
expect
me
to
keep
fresh
in
my
memory
all
the
follies
of
which
my
tongue
is
guilty
that
is
quite
she
turned
as
if
to
go
grayling
atherton
the
matter
what
have
i
been
saying
now
night
you
invited
me
to
come
and
see
you
this
morning
is
that
one
of
the
follies
of
which
your
tongue
was
guilty
the
engagement
had
escaped
my
recollection
it
is
a
fact
and
my
face
betrayed
me
had
forgotten
her
cheeks
flamed
her
eyes
sparkled
must
pardon
my
stupidity
for
not
having
understood
that
the
imitation
was
of
that
general
kind
which
is
never
meant
to
be
acted
on
she
was
half
way
to
the
door
before
i
stopped
her
i
had
to
take
her
by
the
shoulder
to
do
it
grayling
you
are
hard
on
me
suppose
i
is
anything
harder
than
to
be
intruded
on
by
an
undesired
and
unexpected
guest
you
are
harder
if
you
knew
what
i
have
gone
through
since
our
conversation
of
last
night
in
your
strength
you
would
be
merciful
what
have
you
gone
through
i
hesitated
what
i
actually
had
gone
through
i
certainly
did
not
propose
to
tell
her
other
reasons
apart
i
did
not
desire
to
seem
madder
than
i
admittedly
am
and
i
lacked
sufficient
plausibility
to
enable
me
to
concoct
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
a
plain
tale
of
the
doings
of
my
midnight
visitor
which
would
have
suggested
that
the
narrator
was
perfectly
sane
so
i
fenced
or
tried
to
one
thing
i
have
had
no
sleep
i
had
not
not
one
single
wink
when
i
did
get
between
the
sheets
night
i
lay
in
agony
i
suffered
from
that
worst
form
of
nightmare
the
nightmare
of
the
man
who
is
wide
awake
there
was
continually
before
my
fevered
eyes
the
strange
figure
of
that
nameless
thing
i
had
often
smiled
at
tales
of
haunted
folk
here
was
i
one
of
them
my
feelings
were
not
rendered
more
agreeable
by
a
strengthening
conviction
that
if
i
had
only
retained
the
normal
attitude
of
a
scientific
observer
i
should
in
all
probability
have
solved
the
mystery
of
my
oriental
friend
and
that
his
example
of
the
genus
of
copridae
might
have
been
pinned
by
a
very
large
pin
on
a
piece
a
monstrous
piece
of
cork
it
was
galling
to
reflect
that
he
and
i
had
played
together
a
game
of
bluff
a
game
at
which
civilisation
was
once
more
proved
to
be
a
failure
she
could
not
have
seen
all
this
in
my
face
but
she
saw
something
because
her
own
look
softened
do
look
tired
she
seemed
to
be
casting
about
in
her
own
mind
for
a
cause
have
been
worrying
she
glanced
round
the
big
laboratory
you
been
spending
the
night
in
this
wizard
cave
the
monosyllable
as
she
uttered
it
was
big
with
meaning
uninvited
she
seated
herself
in
an
a
huge
old
thing
of
shagreen
leather
which
would
have
held
half
a
dozen
of
her
demure
in
it
she
looked
like
an
agreeable
reminiscence
alive
and
a
little
of
the
women
of
long
ago
her
dove
grey
eyes
seemed
to
perceive
so
much
more
than
they
cared
to
show
is
it
that
you
have
forgotten
that
you
asked
me
to
come
you
mean
it
course
i
meant
it
how
is
it
you
forgotten
did
forget
tell
something
is
the
matter
tell
me
what
it
is
it
that
i
am
too
early
of
the
sort
you
could
be
too
early
when
you
pay
a
compliment
even
so
neat
an
one
as
that
sometimes
you
should
look
as
if
you
meant
it
is
early
i
know
it
early
but
afterwards
i
want
you
to
come
to
lunch
i
told
aunt
that
i
would
bring
you
back
with
me
are
much
better
to
me
than
i
deserve
a
tone
came
into
her
voice
which
was
almost
pathetic
think
that
to
some
men
women
are
almost
better
than
they
deserve
i
do
know
why
i
suppose
it
pleases
them
it
is
odd
there
was
a
different
intonation
a
dryness
you
forgotten
what
i
came
for
a
bit
of
it
i
am
not
quite
the
brute
i
seem
you
came
to
see
an
illustration
of
that
pleasant
little
fancy
of
mine
for
slaughtering
my
fellows
the
fact
is
i
hardly
in
a
mood
for
that
just
now
been
illustrating
it
too
much
already
do
you
mean
for
one
thing
it
been
murdering
lessingham
cat
lessingham
cat
it
almost
murdered
percy
woodville
atherton
i
wish
you
would
talk
like
that
a
fact
it
was
a
question
of
a
little
matter
in
a
wrong
place
and
if
it
had
been
for
something
very
like
a
miracle
he
be
dead
wish
you
would
have
anything
to
do
with
such
things
i
hate
them
i
stared
them
i
thought
you
come
to
see
an
illustration
pray
what
was
your
notion
of
an
illustration
another
cat
would
have
had
to
be
killed
at
least
do
you
suppose
that
i
would
have
sat
still
while
a
cat
was
being
killed
for
my
edification
need
necessarily
have
been
a
cat
but
something
would
have
had
to
be
killed
how
are
you
going
to
illustrate
the
propensities
of
a
weapon
of
that
sort
without
it
it
possible
that
you
imagine
that
i
came
here
to
see
something
killed
for
what
did
you
come
i
do
not
know
what
there
was
about
the
question
which
was
startling
but
as
soon
as
it
was
out
she
went
a
fiery
red
i
was
a
fool
i
was
bewildered
either
she
had
got
out
of
the
wrong
side
of
bed
or
i
had
or
we
both
had
here
she
was
assailing
me
hammer
and
tongs
so
far
as
i
could
see
for
absolutely
nothing
are
pleased
to
be
satirical
at
my
expense
should
not
dare
your
detection
of
me
would
be
so
painfully
rapid
i
was
in
no
mood
for
jangling
i
turned
a
little
away
from
her
immediately
she
was
at
my
elbow
atherton
grayling
you
cross
with
me
should
i
be
if
it
pleases
you
to
laugh
at
my
stupidity
you
are
completely
justified
you
are
not
stupid
nor
you
satirical
are
not
stupid
you
know
you
are
not
stupid
it
was
only
stupidity
on
my
part
to
pretend
that
you
were
is
very
good
of
you
to
say
but
i
fear
that
i
am
an
indifferent
host
although
you
would
not
care
for
an
illustration
there
may
be
other
things
which
you
might
find
amusing
do
you
keep
on
snubbing
me
keep
on
snubbing
you
are
always
snubbing
me
you
know
you
are
some
times
i
feel
as
if
i
hated
you
grayling
do
i
do
i
do
all
it
is
only
natural
is
how
you
talk
as
if
i
were
a
child
and
you
were
oh
i
know
well
mr
atherton
i
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
leave
you
i
have
enjoyed
my
visit
very
much
i
only
hope
i
have
not
seemed
too
intrusive
she
flounced
was
the
only
appropriate
word
out
of
the
room
before
i
could
stop
her
i
caught
her
in
the
passage
grayling
i
entreat
you
do
not
entreat
me
mr
atherton
standing
still
she
turned
to
me
would
rather
show
myself
to
the
door
as
i
showed
myself
in
but
if
that
is
impossible
might
i
ask
you
not
to
speak
to
me
between
this
and
the
street
the
hint
was
broad
enough
even
for
me
i
escorted
her
through
the
hall
without
a
word
in
perfect
silence
she
shook
the
dust
of
my
abode
from
off
her
feet
i
had
made
a
pretty
mess
of
things
i
felt
it
as
i
stood
on
the
top
of
the
steps
and
watched
her
going
she
was
walking
off
at
four
miles
an
hour
i
had
not
even
ventured
to
ask
to
be
allowed
to
call
a
hansom
it
was
beginning
to
occur
to
me
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
another
blow
upon
the
river
might
be
to
say
the
least
of
it
advisable
and
i
was
just
returning
into
the
house
with
the
intention
of
putting
myself
into
my
flannels
when
a
cab
drew
up
and
old
lindon
got
out
of
it
chapter
xx
a
heavy
father
mr
lindon
was
excited
there
is
no
mistaking
it
when
he
is
because
with
him
excitement
means
perspiration
and
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
cab
he
took
off
his
hat
and
began
to
wipe
the
lining
i
want
to
speak
to
you
most
particularly
somewhere
in
private
i
took
him
into
my
laboratory
it
is
my
rule
to
take
no
one
there
it
is
a
workshop
not
a
playroom
the
place
is
private
but
recently
my
rules
had
become
dead
letters
directly
he
was
inside
lindon
began
puffing
and
stewing
wiping
his
forehead
throwing
out
his
chest
as
if
he
were
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
his
own
importance
then
he
started
off
talking
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
it
is
not
a
low
one
either
i
i
always
looked
on
you
as
a
a
kind
of
a
son
very
kind
of
you
always
regarded
you
as
a
a
fellow
a
man
from
whom
sound
advice
can
be
obtained
when
sound
advice
is
is
most
to
be
desired
also
is
very
kind
of
you
therefore
i
make
no
apology
for
coming
to
you
at
at
what
may
be
regarded
as
a
a
strictly
domestic
crisis
at
a
moment
in
the
history
of
the
lindons
when
delicacy
and
common
sense
are
are
essentially
required
this
time
i
contented
myself
with
nodding
already
i
perceived
what
was
coming
somehow
when
i
am
with
a
man
i
feel
so
much
more
than
i
do
when
i
am
with
a
woman
realise
so
much
better
the
nature
of
the
ground
on
which
i
am
standing
do
you
know
of
this
man
lessingham
i
knew
it
was
coming
all
the
world
knows
what
does
all
the
world
know
of
him
i
ask
you
that
a
flashy
plausible
that
is
what
all
the
world
knows
of
him
the
man
a
political
adventurer
he
snatches
a
precarious
and
criminal
notoriety
by
trading
on
the
follies
of
his
he
is
devoid
of
decency
destitute
of
principle
and
impervious
to
all
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
what
do
you
know
of
him
besides
this
am
not
prepared
to
admit
that
i
do
know
that
yes
you
do
do
talk
nonsense
you
choose
to
screen
the
fellow
i
say
what
i
mean
i
always
have
said
and
i
always
shall
what
do
you
know
of
him
outside
politics
of
his
family
of
his
private
life
not
very
much
course
you
do
nor
does
anybody
else
the
man
a
mushroom
or
a
toadstool
rather
sprung
up
in
the
course
of
a
single
night
apparently
out
of
some
dirty
why
sir
not
only
is
he
without
ordinary
intelligence
he
is
even
without
a
brummagen
substitute
for
manners
he
had
worked
himself
into
a
state
of
heat
in
which
his
countenance
presented
a
not
too
agreeable
assortment
of
scarlets
and
purples
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
threw
his
coat
wide
open
and
his
arms
too
and
started
off
again
family
of
the
lindons
is
at
this
moment
represented
by
a
a
young
woman
by
my
daughter
sir
she
represents
me
and
it
her
duty
to
represent
me
adequately
adequately
sir
and
what
more
between
ourselves
sir
it
her
duty
to
marry
my
property
my
own
and
i
would
have
it
pass
to
either
of
my
confounded
brothers
on
any
account
they
next
door
to
fools
and
and
they
do
represent
me
in
any
possible
sense
of
the
word
my
daughter
sir
can
marry
whom
she
pleases
whom
she
pleases
there
no
one
in
england
peer
or
commoner
who
would
not
esteem
it
an
honour
to
have
her
for
his
wife
i
told
her
so
yes
sir
i
told
her
though
you
think
that
she
of
all
people
in
the
world
would
require
telling
yet
what
do
you
think
she
does
she
she
actually
carries
on
what
i
i
ca
help
calling
a
a
compromising
acquaintance
with
this
man
lessingham
i
say
yes
and
i
wish
to
heaven
i
did
i
i
warned
her
against
the
scoundrel
more
than
once
i
i
told
her
to
cut
him
dead
and
yet
as
as
you
saw
yourself
last
night
in
in
the
face
of
the
assembled
house
of
commons
after
that
twaddling
speech
of
his
in
which
there
was
not
one
sound
sentiment
nor
an
idea
which
which
would
hold
water
she
positively
went
away
with
him
in
in
the
most
ostentatious
and
and
disgraceful
fashion
on
on
his
arm
and
and
actually
snubbed
her
it
is
monstrous
that
a
parent
a
father
should
be
subjected
to
such
treatment
by
his
child
the
poor
old
boy
polished
his
brow
with
his
i
got
home
i
i
told
her
what
i
thought
of
her
i
promise
you
that
and
i
told
her
what
i
thought
of
him
i
did
mince
my
words
with
her
there
are
occasions
when
plain
speaking
is
demanded
and
that
was
one
i
positively
forbade
her
to
speak
to
the
fellow
again
or
to
recognise
him
if
she
met
him
in
the
street
i
pointed
out
to
her
with
perfect
candour
that
the
fellow
was
an
infernal
scoundrel
that
and
nothing
else
and
that
he
would
bring
disgrace
on
whoever
came
into
contact
with
him
even
with
the
end
of
a
barge
and
what
do
you
think
she
said
promised
to
obey
you
i
make
no
doubt
she
sir
by
gad
did
she
that
shows
how
much
you
know
her
she
said
and
by
gad
by
her
manner
and
and
the
way
she
went
on
you
you
have
thought
that
she
was
the
parent
and
i
was
the
child
she
said
that
i
i
grieved
her
that
she
was
disappointed
in
me
that
times
have
changed
yes
sir
she
said
that
times
have
changed
that
nowadays
parents
were
russian
autocrats
no
sir
not
russian
autocrats
that
that
she
was
sorry
she
could
oblige
me
yes
sir
that
was
how
she
put
it
she
was
sorry
she
oblige
me
but
it
was
altogether
out
of
the
question
to
suppose
that
she
could
put
a
period
to
a
friendship
which
she
valued
simply
on
account
my
unreasonable
prejudices
and
and
and
in
short
she
she
told
me
to
go
the
devil
sir
did
you
i
was
on
the
point
of
asking
him
if
he
went
but
i
checked
myself
in
time
us
look
at
the
matter
as
men
of
the
world
what
do
you
know
against
lessingham
apart
from
his
politics
just
it
i
know
nothing
a
sense
is
that
in
his
favour
do
see
how
you
make
that
out
i
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
i
had
inquiries
made
he
not
been
in
the
house
six
years
this
is
his
second
parliament
he
jumped
up
like
a
his
first
constituency
was
harwich
they
got
him
still
and
much
good
may
he
do
but
how
he
came
to
stand
for
the
place
or
who
or
what
or
where
he
was
before
he
stood
for
the
place
no
one
seems
to
have
the
faintest
notion
he
been
a
great
traveller
never
heard
of
it
in
the
east
he
told
you
so
i
was
only
wondering
well
it
seems
to
me
that
to
find
out
that
nothing
is
known
against
him
is
something
in
his
favour
dear
sydney
do
talk
nonsense
what
it
proves
is
simply
that
he
a
nothing
and
a
nobody
had
he
been
anything
or
anyone
something
would
have
been
known
about
him
either
for
or
against
i
do
want
my
daughter
to
marry
a
man
who
who
who
shot
up
through
a
trap
simply
because
nothing
is
known
against
him
me
if
i
would
ten
times
sooner
she
should
marry
you
when
he
said
that
my
heart
leaped
in
my
bosom
i
had
to
turn
away
am
afraid
that
is
out
of
the
question
he
stopped
in
his
tramping
and
looked
at
me
askance
i
felt
that
if
i
was
not
careful
i
should
be
done
for
and
probably
in
his
present
mood
marjorie
too
dear
lindon
i
can
not
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
for
your
suggestion
but
i
can
only
repeat
that
unfortunately
anything
of
the
kind
is
out
of
the
question
do
see
why
not
you
a
pretty
lot
upon
my
word
afraid
we
are
i
want
you
to
tell
her
that
lessingham
is
a
damned
scoundrel
but
i
would
suggest
that
if
i
am
to
use
the
influence
with
which
you
credit
me
to
the
best
advantage
or
to
preserve
a
shred
of
it
i
had
hardly
better
state
the
fact
quite
so
bluntly
as
that
do
care
how
you
state
it
state
it
as
you
like
only
only
i
want
you
to
soak
her
mind
with
a
loathing
of
the
fellow
i
i
i
want
you
to
paint
him
in
his
true
colours
in
in
in
fact
i
i
want
you
to
choke
him
off
while
he
still
struggled
with
his
words
and
with
the
perspiration
on
his
brow
edwards
entered
i
turned
to
him
is
it
lindon
sir
wishes
to
see
you
particularly
and
at
once
at
that
moment
i
found
the
announcement
a
trifle
perplexing
it
delighted
lindon
he
began
to
stutter
and
to
stammer
very
thing
have
been
better
show
her
in
here
h
hide
me
somewhere
i
do
care
where
behind
that
screen
use
your
influence
with
her
her
a
good
talking
to
her
what
i
told
you
and
at
at
the
critical
moment
i
come
in
and
then
then
if
we
ca
manage
her
between
us
it
be
a
wonder
the
proposition
staggered
me
my
dear
mr
lindon
i
fear
that
i
can
not
he
cut
me
short
she
comes
ere
i
could
stop
him
he
was
behind
the
screen
i
had
not
seen
him
move
with
such
agility
before
and
before
i
could
expostulate
marjorie
was
in
the
room
something
which
was
in
her
bearing
in
her
face
in
her
eyes
quickened
the
beating
of
my
pulses
she
looked
as
if
something
had
come
into
her
life
and
taken
the
joy
clean
out
of
it
chapter
xxi
the
terror
in
the
night
she
cried
so
glad
that
i
can
see
you
she
might
be
but
at
that
moment
i
could
scarcely
assert
that
i
was
a
sharer
of
her
joy
told
you
that
if
trouble
overtook
me
i
should
come
to
you
and
in
trouble
now
such
strange
trouble
so
was
i
and
in
perplexity
as
well
an
idea
occurred
to
me
i
would
outwit
her
eavesdropping
father
with
me
into
the
house
tell
me
all
about
it
there
she
refused
to
budge
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
here
she
looked
about
her
as
it
struck
me
queerly
is
just
the
sort
of
place
in
which
to
unfold
a
tale
like
mine
it
looks
uncanny
but
me
no
buts
sydney
do
torture
me
let
me
stop
here
where
i
am
do
you
see
i
haunted
she
had
seated
herself
now
she
stood
up
holding
her
hands
out
in
front
of
her
in
a
state
of
extraordinary
agitation
her
manner
as
wild
as
her
words
are
you
staring
at
me
like
that
do
you
think
i
mad
i
wonder
if
i
going
sydney
do
people
suddenly
go
mad
you
a
bit
of
everything
you
a
bit
of
a
doctor
too
feel
my
pulse
there
it
is
tell
me
if
i
ill
i
felt
her
pulse
it
did
not
need
its
swift
beating
to
inform
me
that
fever
of
some
sort
was
in
her
veins
i
gave
her
something
in
a
glass
she
held
it
up
to
the
level
of
her
eyes
this
a
decoction
of
my
own
you
might
not
think
it
but
my
brain
sometimes
gets
into
a
whirl
i
use
it
as
a
sedative
it
will
do
you
good
she
drained
the
glass
done
me
good
already
i
believe
it
has
that
being
something
like
a
well
sydney
the
storm
has
almost
burst
last
night
papa
forbade
me
to
speak
to
paul
lessingham
by
way
of
a
prelude
mr
lindon
mr
lindon
that
papa
i
fancy
we
almost
quarrelled
i
know
papa
said
some
surprising
things
but
it
a
way
he
has
he
apt
to
say
surprising
things
he
the
best
father
in
the
world
but
it
not
in
his
nature
to
like
a
really
clever
person
your
good
high
dried
old
tory
never
can
i
always
thought
that
that
why
he
so
fond
of
you
you
i
presume
that
is
the
reason
though
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
since
her
entry
i
had
to
the
best
of
my
ability
been
turning
the
position
over
in
my
mind
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
all
things
considered
her
father
had
probably
as
much
right
to
be
a
sharer
of
his
daughter
confidence
as
i
had
even
from
the
vantage
of
the
screen
and
that
for
him
to
hear
a
few
home
truths
proceeding
from
her
lips
might
serve
to
clear
the
air
from
such
a
clearance
the
lady
would
not
be
likely
to
come
off
worst
i
had
not
the
faintest
inkling
of
what
was
the
actual
purport
of
her
visit
she
started
off
as
it
seemed
to
me
at
a
tangent
i
tell
you
last
night
about
what
took
place
yesterday
morning
about
the
adventure
of
my
finding
the
man
a
word
believe
i
meant
to
i
half
disposed
to
think
he
brought
me
trouble
is
there
some
superstition
about
evil
befalling
whoever
shelters
a
homeless
stranger
hope
not
for
humanity
sake
fancy
there
is
i
feel
sure
there
anyhow
listen
to
my
story
yesterday
morning
before
breakfast
to
be
accurate
between
eight
and
nine
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
i
saw
a
crowd
in
the
street
i
sent
peter
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
he
came
back
and
said
there
was
a
man
in
a
fit
i
went
out
to
look
at
the
man
in
the
fit
i
found
lying
on
the
ground
in
the
centre
of
the
crowd
a
man
who
but
for
the
tattered
remnants
of
what
had
apparently
once
been
a
cloak
would
have
been
stark
naked
he
was
covered
with
dust
and
dirt
and
blood
a
dreadful
sight
as
you
know
i
have
had
my
smattering
of
instruction
in
first
aid
to
the
injured
and
that
kind
of
thing
so
as
no
one
else
seemed
to
have
any
sense
and
the
man
seemed
as
good
as
dead
i
thought
i
would
try
my
hand
directly
i
knelt
down
beside
him
what
do
you
think
he
said
you
he
said
in
such
a
queer
hollow
croaking
voice
paul
lessingham
i
was
dreadfully
startled
to
hear
a
perfect
stranger
a
man
in
his
condition
utter
that
name
in
such
a
fashion
to
me
of
all
people
in
the
world
took
me
aback
the
policeman
who
was
holding
his
head
remarked
that
the
first
time
he
opened
his
mouth
i
thought
he
was
dead
he
opened
his
mouth
a
second
time
a
convulsive
movement
went
all
over
him
and
he
exclaimed
with
the
strangest
earnestness
and
so
loudly
that
you
might
have
heard
him
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
be
warned
paul
lessingham
be
warned
it
was
very
silly
of
me
perhaps
but
i
can
not
tell
you
how
his
words
and
his
manner
the
two
together
affected
well
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
was
that
i
had
him
taken
into
the
house
and
washed
and
put
to
bed
and
i
had
the
doctor
sent
for
the
doctor
could
make
nothing
of
it
at
all
he
reported
that
the
man
seemed
to
be
suffering
from
some
sort
of
cataleptic
seizure
i
could
see
that
he
thought
it
likely
to
turn
out
almost
as
interesting
a
case
as
i
did
you
acquaint
your
father
with
the
addition
to
his
household
she
looked
at
me
quizzically
see
when
one
has
such
a
father
as
mine
one
can
not
tell
him
everything
at
once
there
are
occasions
on
which
one
requires
time
i
felt
that
this
would
be
wholesome
hearing
for
old
lindon
night
after
papa
and
i
had
exchanged
our
little
courtesies
which
it
is
to
be
hoped
were
to
papa
satisfaction
since
they
were
not
to
be
mine
i
went
to
see
the
patient
i
was
told
that
he
had
neither
eaten
nor
drunk
moved
nor
spoken
but
so
soon
as
i
approached
his
bed
he
showed
signs
of
agitation
he
half
raised
himself
upon
his
pillow
and
he
called
out
as
if
he
had
been
addressing
some
large
assembly
i
ca
describe
to
you
the
dreadful
something
which
was
in
his
voice
and
on
his
face
paul
lessingham
beware
the
beetle
when
she
said
that
i
was
startled
you
sure
those
were
the
words
he
used
sure
do
you
think
i
could
mistake
them
especially
after
what
has
happened
since
i
hear
them
singing
in
my
ears
they
haunt
me
all
the
time
she
put
her
hands
up
to
her
face
as
if
to
veil
something
from
her
eyes
i
was
becoming
more
and
more
convinced
that
there
was
something
about
the
apostle
connection
with
his
oriental
friend
which
needed
probing
to
the
bottom
sort
of
a
man
is
he
to
look
at
this
patient
of
yours
i
had
my
doubts
as
to
the
gentleman
identity
which
her
words
dissolved
only
however
to
increase
my
mystification
in
another
direction
seems
to
be
between
thirty
and
forty
he
has
light
hair
and
straggling
sandy
whiskers
he
is
so
thin
as
to
be
nothing
but
skin
and
bone
the
doctor
says
it
a
case
of
starvation
say
he
has
light
hair
and
sandy
whiskers
are
you
sure
the
whiskers
are
real
she
opened
her
eyes
course
they
real
why
should
they
be
real
he
strike
you
as
being
a
foreigner
not
he
looks
like
an
englishman
and
he
speaks
like
one
and
not
i
should
say
of
the
lowest
class
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
very
curious
a
weird
quality
in
his
voice
what
i
have
heard
of
it
but
it
is
not
if
it
is
catalepsy
he
is
suffering
from
then
it
is
a
kind
of
catalepsy
i
never
heard
of
have
you
ever
seen
a
clairvoyant
i
nodded
seems
to
me
to
be
in
a
state
of
clairvoyance
of
course
the
doctor
laughed
when
i
told
him
so
but
we
know
what
doctors
are
and
i
still
believe
that
he
is
in
some
condition
of
the
kind
when
he
said
that
last
night
he
struck
me
as
being
under
what
those
sort
of
people
call
and
that
whoever
had
him
under
influence
was
forcing
him
to
speak
against
his
will
for
the
words
came
from
his
lips
as
if
they
had
been
wrung
from
him
in
agony
knowing
what
i
did
know
that
struck
me
as
being
rather
a
remarkable
conclusion
for
her
to
have
reached
by
the
exercise
of
her
own
unaided
powers
of
intuition
but
i
did
not
choose
to
let
her
know
i
thought
so
dear
marjorie
you
who
pride
yourself
on
having
your
imagination
so
strictly
under
control
on
suffering
it
to
take
no
errant
flights
not
the
fact
that
i
do
so
pride
myself
proof
that
i
am
not
likely
to
make
assertions
wildly
proof
at
any
rate
to
you
listen
to
me
when
i
left
that
unfortunate
creature
room
i
had
had
a
nurse
sent
for
i
left
him
in
her
charge
and
reached
my
own
bedroom
i
was
possessed
by
a
profound
conviction
that
some
appalling
intangible
but
very
real
danger
was
at
that
moment
threatening
paul
you
had
had
an
exciting
evening
and
a
discussion
with
your
father
your
patient
words
came
as
a
climax
is
what
i
told
myself
or
rather
that
was
what
i
tried
to
tell
myself
because
in
some
extraordinary
fashion
i
had
lost
the
command
of
my
powers
of
reflection
was
not
precisely
or
at
least
it
was
not
precisely
in
the
sense
you
mean
you
may
laugh
at
me
sydney
but
i
had
an
altogether
indescribable
feeling
a
feeling
which
amounted
to
knowledge
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
the
supernatural
was
not
nonsense
i
wish
it
had
been
nonsense
as
i
have
said
i
was
conscious
completely
conscious
that
some
frightful
peril
was
assailing
paul
i
did
not
know
what
it
was
but
i
did
know
that
it
was
something
altogether
awful
of
which
merely
to
think
was
to
shudder
i
wanted
to
go
to
his
assistance
i
tried
to
more
than
once
but
i
could
and
i
knew
that
i
could
i
knew
that
i
could
move
as
much
as
a
finger
to
help
stop
let
me
finish
i
told
myself
that
it
was
absurd
but
it
would
do
absurd
or
not
there
was
the
terror
with
me
in
the
room
i
knelt
down
and
i
prayed
but
the
words
would
come
i
tried
to
ask
god
to
remove
this
burden
from
my
brain
but
my
longings
would
shape
themselves
into
words
and
my
tongue
was
palsied
i
do
know
how
long
i
struggled
but
at
last
i
came
to
understand
that
for
some
cause
god
had
chosen
to
leave
me
to
fight
the
fight
alone
so
i
got
up
and
undressed
and
went
to
bed
and
that
was
the
worst
of
all
i
had
sent
my
maid
away
in
the
first
rush
of
my
terror
afraid
and
i
think
ashamed
to
let
her
see
my
fear
now
i
would
have
given
anything
to
summon
her
back
again
but
i
could
do
it
i
could
even
ring
the
bell
so
as
i
say
i
got
into
bed
she
paused
as
if
to
collect
her
thoughts
to
listen
to
her
words
and
to
think
of
the
suffering
which
they
meant
to
her
was
almost
more
than
i
could
endure
i
would
have
thrown
away
the
world
to
have
been
able
to
take
her
in
my
arms
and
soothe
her
fears
i
knew
her
to
be
in
general
the
least
hysterical
of
young
women
little
wont
to
become
the
prey
of
mere
delusions
and
incredible
though
it
sounded
i
had
an
innate
conviction
that
even
in
its
wildest
periods
her
story
had
some
sort
of
basis
in
solid
fact
what
that
basis
amounted
to
it
would
be
my
business
at
any
and
every
cost
quickly
to
determine
know
how
you
have
always
laughed
at
me
because
of
my
objection
to
cockroaches
and
how
in
spring
the
neighbourhood
of
has
always
made
me
uneasy
as
soon
as
i
got
into
bed
i
felt
that
something
of
the
kind
was
in
the
room
of
what
kind
kind
of
beetle
i
could
hear
the
whirring
of
its
wings
i
could
hear
its
droning
in
the
air
i
knew
that
it
was
hovering
above
my
head
that
it
was
coming
lower
and
lower
nearer
and
nearer
i
hid
myself
i
covered
myself
all
over
with
the
clothes
then
i
felt
it
bumping
against
the
coverlet
and
sydney
she
drew
closer
her
blanched
cheeks
and
frightened
eyes
made
my
heart
bleed
her
voice
became
but
an
echo
of
itself
followed
me
got
into
the
bed
imagined
it
did
imagine
it
i
heard
it
crawl
along
the
sheets
till
it
found
a
way
between
them
and
then
it
crawled
towards
me
and
i
felt
it
against
my
and
it
there
now
she
raised
the
forefinger
of
her
left
hand
ca
you
hear
it
droning
she
listened
intently
i
listened
too
oddly
enough
at
that
instant
the
droning
of
an
insect
did
become
audible
only
a
bee
child
which
has
found
its
way
through
the
open
window
wish
it
were
only
a
bee
i
wish
it
sydney
do
you
feel
as
if
you
were
in
the
presence
of
evil
do
you
want
to
get
away
from
it
back
into
the
presence
of
god
sydney
pray
i
ca
i
do
know
why
but
i
ca
she
flung
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
pressed
herself
against
me
in
paroxysmal
agitation
the
violence
of
her
emotion
bade
fair
to
unman
me
too
it
was
so
unlike
marjorie
and
i
would
have
given
my
life
to
save
her
from
a
toothache
she
kept
repeating
her
own
words
as
if
she
could
not
help
it
sydney
pray
at
last
i
did
as
she
wished
me
at
least
there
is
no
harm
in
praying
i
never
heard
of
its
bringing
hurt
to
anyone
i
repeated
aloud
the
lord
prayer
first
time
for
i
know
not
how
long
as
the
divine
sentences
came
from
my
lips
hesitatingly
enough
i
make
no
doubt
her
tremors
ceased
she
became
calmer
until
as
i
reached
the
last
great
petition
us
from
evil
she
loosed
her
arms
from
about
my
neck
and
dropped
upon
her
knees
close
to
my
feet
and
she
joined
me
in
the
closing
words
as
a
sort
of
chorus
thine
is
the
kingdom
the
power
and
the
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
when
the
prayer
was
ended
we
both
of
us
were
still
she
with
her
head
bowed
and
her
hands
clasped
and
i
with
something
tugging
at
my
which
i
had
not
felt
there
for
many
and
many
a
year
almost
as
if
it
had
been
my
mother
hand
i
daresay
that
sometimes
she
does
stretch
out
her
hand
from
her
place
among
the
angels
to
touch
my
and
i
know
nothing
of
it
all
the
while
as
the
silence
still
continued
i
chanced
to
glance
up
and
there
was
old
lindon
peeping
at
us
from
his
behind
the
screen
the
look
of
amazed
perplexity
which
was
on
his
big
red
face
struck
me
with
such
a
keen
sense
of
the
incongruous
that
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
laughter
apparently
the
sight
of
us
did
nothing
to
lighten
the
fog
which
was
in
his
brain
for
he
stammered
out
in
what
was
possibly
intended
for
a
whisper
is
she
the
whisper
if
it
was
meant
for
a
whisper
was
more
than
sufficiently
audible
to
catch
his
daughter
ears
she
started
raised
her
head
sprang
to
her
feet
turned
and
saw
her
father
immediately
her
sire
was
seized
with
an
access
of
stuttering
the
the
the
of
this
her
utterance
was
clear
enough
i
fancy
her
parent
found
it
almost
painfully
clear
it
is
for
me
to
ask
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
is
it
possible
that
all
the
time
you
have
actually
been
concealed
behind
that
screen
unless
i
am
mistaken
the
old
gentleman
cowered
before
the
directness
of
his
daughter
gaze
and
endeavoured
to
conceal
the
fact
by
an
explosion
of
passion
you
to
me
that
you
girl
i
your
father
certainly
are
my
father
though
i
was
unaware
until
now
that
my
father
was
capable
of
playing
the
part
of
eavesdropper
rage
rendered
him
speechless
or
at
any
rate
he
chose
to
let
us
believe
that
that
was
the
determining
cause
of
his
continuing
silence
so
marjorie
turned
to
me
and
on
the
whole
i
had
rather
she
had
not
her
manner
was
very
different
from
what
it
had
been
just
now
it
was
more
than
civil
it
was
freezing
i
to
understand
mr
atherton
that
this
has
been
done
with
your
cognisance
that
while
you
suffered
me
to
pour
out
my
heart
to
you
unchecked
you
were
aware
all
the
time
that
there
was
a
listener
behind
the
screen
i
became
keenly
aware
on
a
sudden
that
i
had
borne
my
share
in
playing
her
a
very
shabby
trick
i
should
have
liked
to
throw
old
lindon
through
the
window
thing
was
not
of
my
contriving
had
i
had
the
opportunity
i
would
have
compelled
mr
lindon
to
face
you
when
you
came
in
but
your
distress
caused
me
to
lose
my
balance
and
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
remember
that
i
endeavoured
to
induce
you
to
come
with
me
into
another
room
i
do
not
seem
to
remember
your
hinting
at
there
being
any
particular
reason
why
i
should
have
gone
never
gave
me
a
chance
i
had
not
thought
you
would
have
played
me
such
a
trick
when
she
said
that
in
such
a
tone
the
woman
whom
i
loved
i
could
have
hammered
my
head
against
the
wall
the
hound
i
was
to
have
treated
her
so
scurvily
perceiving
i
was
crushed
she
turned
again
to
face
her
father
cool
calm
stately
she
was
on
a
sudden
once
more
the
marjorie
with
whom
i
was
familiar
the
demeanour
of
parent
and
child
was
in
striking
contrast
if
appearances
went
for
aught
the
odds
were
heavy
that
in
any
encounter
which
might
be
coming
the
senior
would
suffer
hope
papa
that
you
are
going
to
tell
me
that
there
has
been
some
curious
mistake
and
that
nothing
was
farther
from
your
intention
than
to
listen
at
a
keyhole
what
would
you
have
thought
and
said
if
i
had
attempted
to
play
the
spy
on
you
and
i
have
always
understood
that
men
were
so
particular
on
points
of
honour
old
lindon
was
still
hardly
fit
to
do
much
else
than
splutter
certainly
not
qualified
to
chop
phrases
with
this
maiden
talk
to
me
that
girl
i
i
believe
you
mad
he
turned
to
me
was
that
tomfoolery
she
was
talking
to
you
about
what
do
you
allude
a
and
alone
knows
what
and
imagination
on
the
literature
of
the
gutter
i
never
thought
that
a
child
of
mine
could
have
to
such
a
depth
now
atherton
i
ask
you
to
me
frankly
what
do
you
think
of
a
child
who
behaves
as
she
has
done
who
a
nameless
vagabond
into
the
house
and
his
presence
from
her
father
and
the
sequel
even
the
vagabond
warns
her
against
the
lessingham
now
atherton
tell
me
what
you
think
of
a
girl
who
behaves
like
that
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
know
very
well
what
you
think
of
her
do
be
afraid
to
say
it
out
because
she
present
sydney
do
be
afraid
i
saw
that
her
eyes
were
dancing
in
a
manner
of
speaking
her
looks
brightened
under
the
sunshine
of
her
father
displeasure
hear
what
you
think
of
her
as
a
as
a
of
the
world
sydney
do
you
feel
for
her
in
your
your
heart
of
hearts
sydney
what
do
you
feel
for
me
in
your
heart
of
hearts
the
baggage
beamed
with
heartless
sweetness
she
was
making
a
mock
of
me
her
father
turned
as
if
he
would
have
rent
her
you
speak
until
you
spoken
to
atherton
i
i
hope
i
not
deceived
in
you
i
i
hope
you
the
man
i
i
took
you
for
that
you
willing
and
and
ready
to
play
the
part
of
honest
friend
to
this
simpleton
is
not
the
time
for
mincing
words
it
it
the
time
for
candid
speech
tell
this
this
weak
minded
young
woman
right
out
whether
this
man
lessingham
is
or
is
not
a
damned
scoundrel
do
you
really
think
that
sydney
opinion
or
your
opinion
is
likely
to
alter
facts
you
hear
atherton
tell
this
wretched
girl
the
truth
dear
mr
lindon
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
know
nothing
either
for
or
against
mr
lessingham
except
what
is
known
to
all
the
world
and
all
the
world
knows
him
to
be
a
miserable
adventurer
who
is
scheming
to
entrap
my
daughter
am
bound
to
say
since
you
press
me
that
your
language
appears
to
me
to
be
unnecessarily
strong
i
i
ashamed
of
you
see
sydney
even
papa
is
ashamed
of
you
now
you
are
outside
the
my
dear
papa
if
you
will
allow
me
to
speak
i
will
tell
you
what
i
know
to
be
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
that
mr
lessingham
is
a
man
with
great
gifts
goes
without
saying
permit
me
papa
he
is
a
man
of
genius
he
is
a
man
of
honour
he
is
a
man
of
the
loftiest
ambitions
of
the
highest
aims
he
has
dedicated
his
whole
life
to
the
improvement
of
the
conditions
amidst
which
the
less
fortunate
of
his
fellow
countrymen
are
at
present
compelled
to
exist
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
object
well
worth
having
he
has
asked
me
to
share
his
and
i
have
told
him
that
i
will
when
and
where
and
how
he
wants
me
to
and
i
will
i
do
not
suppose
his
life
has
been
free
from
peccadilloes
i
have
no
delusion
on
the
point
what
man
life
has
who
among
men
can
claim
to
be
without
sin
even
the
members
of
our
highest
families
sometimes
hide
behind
screens
but
i
know
that
he
is
at
least
as
good
a
man
as
i
ever
met
i
am
persuaded
that
i
shall
never
meet
a
better
and
i
thank
god
that
i
have
found
favour
in
his
i
suppose
i
shall
see
you
again
papa
with
the
merest
inclination
of
her
head
to
both
of
us
she
straightway
left
the
room
lindon
would
have
stopped
her
he
stuttered
but
i
caught
him
by
the
arm
you
will
be
advised
by
me
you
will
let
her
go
no
good
purpose
will
be
served
by
a
multiplication
of
words
i
i
disappointed
in
you
you
you
have
behaved
as
i
expected
i
i
have
received
from
you
the
assistance
which
i
looked
for
dear
lindon
it
seems
to
me
that
your
method
of
diverting
the
young
lady
from
the
path
which
she
has
set
herself
to
tread
is
calculated
to
send
her
furiously
along
it
the
women
the
women
i
do
mind
telling
you
in
that
at
at
times
her
mother
was
the
devil
and
be
i
be
hanged
if
her
daughter
is
what
was
the
tomfoolery
she
was
talking
to
you
about
is
she
mad
i
do
think
she
mad
never
heard
such
stuff
it
made
my
blood
run
cold
to
hear
her
what
the
matter
with
the
girl
you
must
excuse
my
saying
that
i
do
fancy
you
quite
understand
women
i
do
and
i
i
i
do
want
to
either
i
hesitated
then
resolved
on
a
taradiddle
in
marjorie
interest
is
extremely
sensitive
her
imagination
is
quickly
aflame
perhaps
last
night
you
drove
her
as
far
as
was
safe
you
heard
for
yourself
how
in
consequence
she
suffered
you
want
people
to
say
you
have
driven
her
into
a
lunatic
asylum
good
heavens
no
i
i
send
for
the
doctor
directly
i
get
home
i
i
have
the
best
opinion
in
town
do
nothing
of
the
kind
you
only
make
her
worse
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
be
patient
with
her
and
let
her
have
as
for
this
affair
of
lessingham
i
have
a
suspicion
that
it
may
not
be
all
such
plain
sailing
as
she
supposes
do
you
mean
mean
nothing
i
only
wish
you
to
understand
that
until
you
hear
from
me
again
you
had
better
let
matters
slide
give
the
girl
her
head
the
girl
her
head
i
i
the
her
all
her
he
looked
at
his
watch
the
day
half
gone
he
began
scurrying
towards
the
front
door
i
following
at
his
heels
got
a
committee
meeting
on
at
the
club
important
for
weeks
they
been
giving
us
the
worst
food
you
ever
tasted
in
your
life
havoc
with
my
digestion
and
i
i
going
to
tell
them
if
things
are
changed
they
they
have
to
pay
my
as
for
that
man
lessingham
as
he
spoke
he
himself
opened
the
hall
door
and
there
standing
on
the
step
was
man
lessingham
himself
lindon
was
a
picture
the
apostle
was
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
he
held
out
his
hand
morning
mr
lindon
what
delightful
weather
we
are
having
lindon
put
his
hand
behind
his
back
and
behaved
as
stupidly
as
he
very
well
could
have
done
will
understand
mr
lessingham
that
in
future
i
do
know
you
and
that
i
shall
decline
to
recognise
you
anywhere
and
that
what
i
say
applies
equally
to
any
member
of
my
family
with
his
hat
very
much
on
the
back
of
his
head
he
went
down
the
steps
like
an
inflated
turkeycock
chapter
xxii
the
haunted
man
to
have
received
the
cut
discourteous
from
his
future
might
have
been
the
most
commonplace
of
incidents
lessingham
evinced
not
a
trace
of
discomposure
so
far
as
i
could
judge
he
took
no
notice
of
the
episode
whatever
behaving
exactly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
he
merely
waited
till
mr
lindon
was
well
off
the
steps
then
turning
to
me
he
placidly
observed
you
again
you
may
i
the
sight
of
him
had
set
up
such
a
turmoil
in
my
veins
that
for
the
moment
i
could
not
trust
myself
to
speak
i
felt
acutely
that
an
explanation
with
him
was
of
all
things
the
thing
most
to
be
desired
and
that
quickly
providence
could
not
have
thrown
him
more
opportunely
in
the
way
if
before
he
went
away
we
did
not
understand
each
other
a
good
deal
more
clearly
upon
certain
points
the
fault
should
not
be
mine
without
a
responsive
word
turning
on
my
heels
i
led
the
way
into
the
laboratory
whether
he
noticed
anything
peculiar
in
my
demeanour
i
could
not
tell
within
he
looked
about
him
with
that
purely
facial
smile
the
sight
of
which
had
always
engendered
in
me
a
certain
distrust
of
him
you
always
receive
visitors
in
here
no
means
is
this
stooping
down
he
picked
up
something
from
the
floor
it
was
a
purse
a
gorgeous
affair
of
crimson
leather
and
gleaming
gold
whether
it
was
marjorie
or
miss
grayling
i
could
not
tell
he
watched
me
as
i
examined
it
it
yours
it
is
not
mine
placing
his
hat
and
umbrella
on
one
chair
he
placed
himself
upon
another
very
leisurely
crossing
his
legs
laying
his
folded
hands
upon
his
knees
he
sat
and
looked
at
me
i
was
quite
conscious
of
his
observation
but
endured
it
in
silence
being
a
little
wishful
that
he
should
begin
presently
he
had
as
i
suppose
enough
of
looking
at
me
and
spoke
what
is
the
matter
with
you
have
i
done
something
to
offend
you
too
do
you
ask
manner
seems
a
little
singular
think
so
do
have
you
come
to
see
me
about
now
i
like
to
know
where
i
stand
his
manner
was
courteous
easy
even
graceful
i
was
outmanoeuvred
i
understood
the
man
sufficiently
well
to
be
aware
that
when
once
he
was
on
the
defensive
the
first
blow
would
have
to
come
from
me
so
i
struck
it
also
like
to
know
where
i
lessingham
i
am
aware
and
you
know
that
i
am
aware
that
you
have
made
certain
overtures
to
miss
lindon
that
is
a
fact
in
which
i
am
keenly
interested
how
lindons
and
the
athertons
are
not
the
acquaintances
of
one
generation
only
marjorie
lindon
and
i
have
been
friends
since
childhood
she
looks
upon
me
as
a
brother
a
brother
a
brother
lindon
regains
me
as
a
son
he
has
given
me
his
confidence
as
i
believe
you
are
aware
marjorie
has
given
me
hers
and
now
i
want
you
to
give
me
yours
do
you
want
to
know
wish
to
explain
my
position
before
i
say
what
i
have
to
say
because
i
want
you
to
understand
me
i
believe
honestly
that
the
thing
i
most
desire
in
this
world
is
to
see
marjorie
lindon
happy
if
i
thought
she
would
be
happy
with
you
i
should
say
god
speed
you
both
and
i
should
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
because
i
think
that
you
would
have
won
the
best
girl
in
the
whole
world
to
be
your
wife
think
so
too
before
i
did
that
i
should
have
to
see
at
least
some
reasonable
probability
that
she
would
be
happy
with
you
should
she
not
you
answer
a
question
is
the
question
is
the
story
in
your
life
of
which
you
stand
in
such
hideous
terror
there
was
a
perceptible
pause
before
he
answered
yourself
explanation
is
needed
you
know
perfectly
well
what
i
mean
credit
me
with
miraculous
acumen
juggle
lessingham
be
frank
frankness
should
not
be
all
on
one
there
is
that
in
your
frankness
although
you
may
be
unconscious
of
it
which
some
men
might
not
unreasonably
resent
you
resent
it
depends
if
you
are
arrogating
to
yourself
the
right
to
place
yourself
between
miss
lindon
and
me
i
do
resent
it
strongly
my
question
answer
no
question
which
is
addressed
to
me
in
such
a
tone
he
was
as
calm
as
you
please
i
recognised
that
already
i
was
in
peril
of
losing
my
temper
which
was
not
at
all
what
i
desired
i
eyed
him
intently
he
returning
me
look
for
look
his
countenance
betrayed
no
sign
of
a
guilty
conscience
i
had
not
seen
him
more
completely
at
his
ease
he
smiled
facially
and
also
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
little
derisively
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
his
bearing
showed
not
the
faintest
shadow
of
resentment
and
that
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
gentleness
a
softness
which
i
had
not
observed
in
them
before
i
could
almost
have
suspected
him
of
being
sympathetic
this
matter
you
must
know
i
stand
in
the
place
of
mr
lindon
you
must
understand
that
before
anyone
is
allowed
to
think
of
marriage
with
marjorie
lindon
he
will
have
to
show
that
his
past
as
the
advertisements
have
it
will
bear
the
fullest
investigation
that
so
will
your
past
bear
the
fullest
investigation
i
winced
any
rate
it
is
known
to
all
the
world
it
forgive
me
if
i
say
i
doubt
it
i
doubt
if
of
any
wise
man
that
can
be
said
with
truth
in
all
our
lives
there
are
episodes
which
we
keep
to
ourselves
i
felt
that
that
was
so
true
that
for
the
instant
i
hardly
knew
what
to
say
there
are
episodes
and
episodes
and
when
it
comes
to
a
man
being
haunted
one
draws
the
line
you
are
he
got
up
i
think
that
i
understand
you
but
i
fear
that
you
do
not
understand
me
he
went
to
where
a
mercurial
was
standing
on
a
shelf
is
this
curious
arrangement
of
glass
tubes
and
bulbs
do
not
think
that
you
do
understand
me
or
you
would
know
that
i
am
in
no
mood
to
be
trifled
with
it
some
kind
of
an
exhauster
dear
lessingham
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
i
intend
to
have
an
answer
to
my
question
before
you
leave
this
room
but
in
the
meanwhile
your
convenience
is
mine
there
are
some
very
interesting
things
here
which
you
might
care
to
see
is
it
not
how
the
human
intellect
progresses
from
conquest
unto
conquest
the
ancients
the
progression
had
proceeded
farther
than
with
us
what
respect
instance
in
the
affair
of
the
apotheosis
of
the
beetle
i
saw
it
take
place
last
night
within
a
few
feet
of
where
you
are
standing
you
serious
did
you
see
saw
the
legendary
apotheosis
of
the
beetle
performed
last
night
before
my
eyes
with
a
gaudy
magnificence
at
which
the
legends
never
hinted
is
odd
i
once
thought
that
i
saw
something
of
the
kind
myself
i
understand
whom
a
friend
of
yours
a
friend
of
mine
are
you
sure
it
was
from
a
friend
of
mine
the
man
attempt
at
coolness
did
him
credit
but
it
did
not
deceive
me
that
he
thought
i
was
endeavouring
to
bluff
him
out
of
his
secret
i
perceived
quite
clearly
that
it
was
a
secret
which
he
would
only
render
with
his
life
i
was
beginning
to
suspect
had
it
not
been
for
marjorie
i
should
have
cared
nothing
his
affairs
were
his
affairs
though
i
realised
perfectly
well
that
there
was
something
about
the
man
which
from
the
scientific
explorer
point
of
view
might
be
well
worth
finding
out
still
as
i
say
if
it
had
not
been
for
marjorie
i
should
have
let
it
go
but
since
she
was
so
intimately
concerned
in
it
i
wondered
more
and
more
what
it
could
be
my
attitude
towards
what
is
called
the
supernatural
is
an
open
one
that
all
things
are
possible
i
unhesitatingly
believe
i
have
even
in
my
short
time
seen
so
many
impossibilities
proved
possible
that
we
know
everything
i
doubt
that
our
our
forebears
of
thousands
of
years
ago
of
the
extinct
civilisations
knew
more
on
some
subjects
than
we
do
i
think
is
at
least
probable
all
the
legends
can
hardly
be
false
because
men
claimed
to
be
able
to
do
things
in
those
days
which
we
can
not
do
and
which
we
do
not
know
how
they
did
we
profess
to
think
that
their
claims
are
finally
dismissed
by
exclaiming
lies
but
it
is
not
so
sure
for
my
part
what
i
had
seen
i
had
seen
i
had
seen
some
devil
trick
played
before
my
very
eyes
some
trick
of
the
same
sort
seemed
to
have
been
played
upon
my
marjorie
i
repeat
that
i
write
because
to
me
she
will
always
be
marjorie
it
had
driven
her
half
out
of
her
senses
as
i
looked
at
lessingham
i
seemed
to
see
her
at
his
side
as
i
had
seen
her
not
long
ago
with
her
white
drawn
face
and
staring
eyes
dumb
with
an
agony
of
fear
her
life
was
bidding
fair
to
be
knit
with
his
what
upas
tree
of
horror
was
rooted
in
his
very
bones
the
thought
that
her
sweet
purity
was
likely
to
be
engulfed
in
a
devil
slough
in
which
he
was
wallowing
was
not
to
be
endured
as
i
realised
that
the
man
was
more
than
my
match
at
the
game
which
i
was
playing
in
which
such
vital
interests
were
at
stake
my
hands
itched
to
clutch
him
by
the
throat
and
try
another
way
doubtless
my
face
revealed
my
feelings
because
presently
he
said
you
aware
how
strangely
you
are
looking
at
me
atherton
were
my
countenance
a
mirror
i
think
you
would
be
surprised
to
see
in
it
your
own
i
drew
back
from
him
i
daresay
sullenly
so
surprised
as
yesterday
morning
you
would
have
been
to
have
seen
yours
at
the
mere
sight
of
a
pictured
scarab
easily
you
quarrel
do
not
quarrel
perhaps
it
i
if
that
is
so
then
at
once
the
ended
pouf
it
done
mr
lindon
i
fear
because
politically
we
differ
regards
me
as
anathema
has
he
put
some
of
his
spirit
into
you
you
are
a
wiser
man
am
aware
that
you
are
an
adept
with
words
but
this
is
a
case
in
which
words
only
will
not
serve
what
will
serve
am
myself
beginning
to
wonder
i
you
so
courteously
suggest
i
believe
i
am
wiser
than
lindon
i
do
not
care
for
your
politics
or
for
what
you
call
your
politics
one
fig
i
do
not
care
if
you
are
as
other
men
are
as
i
am
not
unspotted
from
the
world
but
i
do
care
if
you
are
leprous
and
i
believe
you
are
since
i
have
known
you
i
have
been
conscious
of
there
being
something
about
you
which
i
found
it
difficult
to
diagnose
in
an
unwholesome
sense
something
out
of
the
common
an
atmosphere
of
your
own
events
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
have
during
the
last
few
days
moved
quickly
they
have
thrown
an
uncomfortably
lurid
light
on
that
peculiarity
of
yours
which
i
have
noticed
unless
you
can
explain
them
to
my
satisfaction
you
will
withdraw
your
pretensions
to
miss
lindon
hand
or
i
shall
place
certain
facts
before
that
lady
and
if
necessary
publish
them
to
the
world
he
grew
visibly
paler
but
he
smiled
facially
have
your
own
way
of
conducting
a
conversation
mr
what
are
the
events
to
whose
rapid
transit
you
are
alluding
was
the
individual
practically
stark
naked
who
came
out
of
your
house
in
such
singular
fashion
at
dead
of
night
that
one
of
the
facts
with
which
you
propose
to
tickle
the
public
ear
that
the
only
explanation
which
you
have
to
offer
for
the
present
with
your
indictment
am
not
so
unobservant
as
you
appear
to
imagine
there
were
features
about
the
episode
which
struck
me
forcibly
at
the
time
and
which
have
struck
me
more
forcibly
since
to
suggest
as
you
did
yesterday
morning
that
it
was
an
ordinary
case
of
burglary
or
that
the
man
was
a
lunatic
is
an
absurdity
me
i
did
nothing
of
the
kind
what
do
you
suggest
suggested
and
do
suggest
nothing
all
the
suggestions
come
from
you
went
very
much
out
of
your
way
to
beg
me
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
there
is
an
appearance
of
suggestion
about
that
take
a
jaundiced
view
of
all
my
actions
mr
atherton
nothing
to
me
could
seem
more
however
proceed
he
had
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
rested
them
on
the
edge
of
the
table
against
which
he
was
leaning
he
was
undoubtedly
ill
at
ease
but
so
far
i
had
not
made
the
impression
on
him
either
mentally
or
morally
which
i
desired
is
your
oriental
friend
do
not
follow
you
you
sure
am
certain
repeat
your
question
is
your
oriental
friend
was
not
aware
that
i
had
one
you
swear
that
he
laughed
a
strange
laugh
you
seek
to
catch
me
tripping
you
conduct
your
case
with
too
much
animus
you
must
allow
me
to
grasp
the
exact
purport
of
your
inquiry
before
i
can
undertake
to
reply
to
it
on
oath
you
not
aware
that
at
present
there
is
in
london
an
individual
who
claims
to
have
had
a
very
close
and
a
very
curious
acquaintance
with
you
in
the
east
am
not
you
swear
i
do
swear
is
singular
is
it
singular
i
fancy
that
that
individual
haunts
you
me
you
jest
think
so
you
remember
that
picture
of
the
scarabaeus
which
yesterday
morning
frightened
you
into
a
state
of
use
strong
i
know
what
you
allude
to
you
mean
to
say
that
you
do
know
that
you
were
indebted
for
that
to
your
oriental
friend
do
understand
you
you
sure
i
am
it
occurs
to
me
mr
atherton
that
an
explanation
is
demanded
from
you
rather
than
from
me
are
you
aware
that
the
purport
of
my
presence
here
is
to
ask
you
how
that
picture
found
its
way
into
your
room
was
projected
by
the
lord
of
the
beetle
the
words
were
chance
ones
but
they
struck
a
mark
lord
he
faltered
and
stopped
he
showed
signs
of
discomposure
will
be
frank
with
you
since
frankness
is
what
you
ask
his
smile
that
time
was
obviously
forced
i
have
been
the
victim
of
delusions
there
was
a
pause
before
the
word
a
singular
kind
i
have
feared
that
they
were
the
result
of
mental
overstrain
is
it
possible
that
you
can
enlighten
me
as
to
their
source
i
was
silent
he
was
putting
a
great
strain
upon
himself
but
the
twitching
of
his
lips
betrayed
him
a
little
more
and
i
should
reach
the
other
side
of
mr
lessingham
the
side
which
he
kept
hidden
from
the
world
is
this
individual
whom
you
speak
of
as
my
oriental
friend
your
friend
you
should
know
better
than
i
do
sort
of
man
is
he
to
look
at
did
not
say
it
was
a
man
i
presume
it
is
a
man
did
not
say
so
he
seemed
for
a
moment
to
hold
his
breath
and
he
looked
at
me
with
eyes
which
were
not
friendly
then
with
a
display
of
which
did
him
credit
he
drew
himself
upright
with
an
air
of
dignity
which
well
became
him
consciously
or
unconsciously
you
are
doing
me
a
serious
injustice
i
do
not
know
what
conception
it
is
which
you
have
formed
of
me
or
on
what
the
conception
is
founded
but
i
protest
that
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
i
am
as
reputable
as
honest
and
as
clean
a
man
as
you
are
you
haunted
he
held
himself
erect
looking
me
straight
in
the
face
then
a
shiver
went
all
over
him
the
muscles
of
his
mouth
twitched
and
in
an
instant
he
was
livid
he
staggered
against
the
table
god
knows
it
true
i
haunted
either
you
mad
and
therefore
unfit
to
marry
or
else
done
something
which
places
you
outside
the
tolerably
generous
boundaries
of
civilised
society
and
are
therefore
still
more
unfit
to
marry
you
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
i
the
victim
of
a
delusion
is
the
nature
of
the
delusion
does
it
take
the
shape
of
a
beetle
without
the
slightest
warning
he
collapsed
was
transformed
i
can
describe
the
change
which
took
place
in
him
in
no
other
way
he
sank
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
he
held
up
his
hands
above
his
head
and
he
gibbered
like
some
frenzied
animal
a
more
uncomfortable
spectacle
than
he
presented
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
i
have
seen
it
matched
in
the
padded
rooms
of
lunatic
asylums
but
nowhere
else
the
sight
of
him
set
every
nerve
of
my
body
on
edge
heaven
name
what
is
the
matter
with
you
man
are
you
stark
staring
mad
here
drink
this
filling
a
tumbler
with
brandy
i
forced
it
between
his
quivering
fingers
then
it
was
some
moments
before
i
could
get
him
to
understand
what
it
was
i
wanted
him
to
do
when
he
did
get
the
glass
to
his
lips
he
swallowed
its
contents
as
if
they
were
so
much
water
by
degrees
his
senses
returned
to
him
he
stood
up
he
looked
about
him
with
a
smile
which
was
positively
ghastly
it
a
delusion
a
very
queer
kind
of
a
delusion
if
it
is
i
eyed
him
curiously
he
was
evidently
making
the
most
strenuous
efforts
to
regain
his
all
the
while
with
that
horrible
smile
about
his
lips
you
you
take
me
at
an
advantage
i
was
still
your
oriental
friend
oriental
friend
you
mean
yours
i
supposed
at
first
that
the
individual
in
question
was
a
man
but
it
appears
that
she
a
woman
woman
how
do
you
mean
the
face
is
a
man
of
an
uncommonly
disagreeable
type
of
which
the
powers
forbid
that
there
are
many
and
the
voice
is
a
man
also
of
a
kind
but
the
body
as
last
night
i
chanced
to
discover
is
a
woman
sounds
very
odd
he
closed
his
eyes
i
could
see
that
his
cheeks
were
clammy
you
do
you
believe
in
witchcraft
depends
you
heard
of
obi
have
have
been
told
that
an
obeah
man
can
put
a
spell
upon
a
person
which
compels
a
person
to
see
whatever
he
the
obeah
man
may
please
do
you
think
that
possible
is
not
a
question
to
which
i
should
be
disposed
to
answer
either
yes
or
no
he
looked
at
me
out
of
his
eyes
it
struck
me
that
he
was
making
conversation
saying
anything
for
the
sake
of
gaining
time
remember
reading
a
book
entitled
obscure
diseases
of
the
brain
it
contained
some
interesting
data
on
the
subject
of
hallucinations
candidly
would
you
recommend
me
to
place
myself
in
the
hands
of
a
mental
pathologist
do
think
that
you
insane
if
that
what
you
mean
that
is
good
hearing
of
all
diseases
insanity
is
the
most
to
be
well
atherton
i
keeping
you
the
truth
is
that
insane
or
not
i
am
very
far
from
well
i
think
i
must
give
myself
a
holiday
he
moved
towards
his
hat
and
umbrella
is
something
else
which
you
must
do
is
that
must
resign
your
pretensions
to
miss
lindon
hand
dear
atherton
if
my
health
is
really
failing
me
i
shall
resign
everything
everything
he
repeated
his
own
word
with
a
little
movement
of
his
hands
which
was
pathetic
me
lessingham
what
else
you
do
is
no
affair
of
mine
i
am
concerned
only
with
miss
lindon
you
must
give
me
your
definite
promise
before
you
leave
this
room
to
terminate
your
engagement
with
her
before
his
back
was
towards
me
will
come
a
time
when
your
conscience
will
prick
you
because
of
your
treatment
of
me
when
you
will
realise
that
i
am
the
most
unfortunate
of
men
realise
that
now
it
is
because
i
realise
it
that
i
am
so
desirous
that
the
shadow
of
your
evil
fortune
shall
not
fall
upon
an
innocent
girl
he
turned
what
is
your
actual
position
with
reference
to
marjorie
lindon
regards
me
as
a
brother
do
you
regard
her
as
a
sister
are
your
sentiments
towards
her
purely
fraternal
know
that
i
love
her
do
you
suppose
that
my
removal
will
clear
the
path
for
you
suppose
nothing
of
the
kind
you
may
believe
me
or
not
but
my
one
desire
is
for
her
happiness
and
surely
if
you
love
her
that
is
your
desire
too
is
so
he
paused
an
expression
of
sadness
stole
over
his
face
of
which
i
had
not
thought
it
capable
is
so
to
an
extent
of
which
you
do
not
dream
no
man
likes
to
have
his
hand
forced
especially
by
one
whom
he
regards
may
i
say
it
as
a
possible
rival
but
i
will
tell
you
this
much
if
the
blight
which
has
fallen
on
my
life
is
likely
to
continue
i
would
not
wish
god
forbid
that
i
should
wish
to
join
her
fate
with
mine
not
for
all
that
the
world
could
offer
me
he
stopped
and
i
was
still
presently
he
continued
i
was
younger
i
was
subject
to
a
similar
delusion
but
it
vanished
i
saw
no
trace
of
it
for
years
i
thought
that
i
had
done
with
it
for
good
recently
however
it
has
returned
as
you
have
witnessed
i
shall
institute
inquiries
into
the
cause
of
its
reappearance
if
it
seems
likely
to
be
irremovable
or
even
if
it
bids
fair
to
be
prolonged
i
shall
not
only
as
you
phrase
it
withdraw
my
pretensions
to
miss
linden
hand
but
to
all
my
other
ambitions
in
the
interim
as
regards
miss
lindon
i
shall
be
careful
to
hold
myself
on
the
footing
of
a
mere
acquaintance
promise
me
and
on
your
side
atherton
in
the
meantime
deal
with
me
more
gently
judgment
in
my
case
has
still
to
be
given
you
will
find
that
i
am
not
the
guilty
wretch
you
apparently
imagine
and
there
are
few
things
more
disagreeable
to
one
than
to
learn
too
late
that
one
has
persisted
in
judging
another
man
too
harshly
think
of
all
that
the
world
has
at
this
moment
to
offer
me
and
what
it
will
mean
if
i
have
to
turn
my
back
on
it
owing
to
a
mischievous
twist
of
fortune
wheel
he
turned
is
if
to
go
then
stopped
and
looked
round
in
an
attitude
of
listening
that
there
was
a
sound
of
droning
i
recalled
what
marjorie
had
said
of
her
experiences
of
the
night
before
it
was
like
the
droning
of
a
beetle
the
instant
the
apostle
heard
it
the
fashion
of
his
countenance
began
to
change
it
was
pitiable
to
witness
i
rushed
to
him
do
be
a
fool
play
the
man
he
gripped
my
left
arm
with
his
right
hand
till
it
felt
as
if
it
were
being
compressed
in
a
vice
i
shall
have
to
have
some
more
brandy
fortunately
the
bottle
was
within
reach
from
where
i
stood
otherwise
i
doubt
if
he
would
have
released
my
arm
to
let
me
get
at
it
i
gave
him
the
decanter
and
the
glass
he
helped
himself
to
a
copious
libation
by
the
time
that
he
had
swallowed
it
the
droning
sound
had
gone
he
put
down
the
empty
tumbler
a
man
has
to
resort
to
alcohol
to
keep
his
nerves
up
to
concert
pitch
things
are
in
a
bad
way
with
him
you
may
be
sure
of
that
but
then
you
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
stand
in
momentary
expectation
of
a
with
the
devil
again
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
and
this
time
he
actually
went
i
let
him
go
alone
i
heard
his
footsteps
passing
along
the
passage
and
the
close
then
i
sat
in
an
stretched
my
legs
out
in
front
of
me
thrust
my
hands
in
my
trouser
pockets
and
i
wondered
i
had
been
there
perhaps
four
or
five
minutes
when
there
was
a
slight
noise
at
my
side
glancing
round
i
saw
a
sheet
of
paper
come
fluttering
through
the
open
window
it
fell
almost
at
my
feet
i
picked
it
up
it
was
a
picture
of
a
beetle
a
facsimile
of
the
one
which
had
had
such
an
extraordinary
effect
on
mr
lessingham
the
day
before
this
was
intended
for
st
paul
it
a
trifle
late
unless
i
could
hear
that
someone
was
approaching
along
the
corridor
i
looked
up
expecting
to
see
the
apostle
reappear
in
which
expectation
i
was
agreeably
disappointed
the
newcomer
was
feminine
it
was
miss
grayling
as
she
stood
in
the
open
doorway
i
saw
that
her
cheeks
were
red
as
roses
hope
i
am
not
interrupting
you
again
but
i
left
my
purse
here
she
stopped
then
added
as
if
it
were
an
afterthought
i
want
you
to
come
and
lunch
with
me
i
locked
the
picture
of
the
beetle
in
the
drawer
and
i
lunched
with
dora
grayling
book
iii
the
terror
by
night
and
the
terror
by
day
miss
marjorie
lindon
tells
the
tale
chapter
xxiii
the
way
he
told
her
i
am
the
happiest
woman
in
the
world
i
wonder
how
many
women
have
said
that
of
themselves
in
their
time
but
i
am
paul
has
told
me
that
he
loves
me
how
long
i
have
made
inward
confession
of
my
love
for
him
i
should
be
ashamed
to
say
it
sounds
prosaic
but
i
believe
it
is
a
fact
that
the
first
stirring
of
my
pulses
was
caused
by
the
report
of
a
speech
of
his
which
i
read
in
the
times
it
was
on
the
eight
bill
papa
was
most
unflattering
he
said
that
he
was
an
oily
spouter
an
ignorant
agitator
an
irresponsible
firebrand
and
a
good
deal
more
to
the
same
effect
i
remember
very
well
how
papa
fidgeted
with
the
paper
declaring
that
it
read
even
worse
than
it
had
sounded
and
goodness
knew
that
it
had
sounded
bad
enough
he
was
so
very
emphatic
that
when
he
had
gone
i
thought
i
would
see
what
all
the
pother
was
about
and
read
the
speech
for
myself
so
i
read
it
it
affected
me
quite
differently
the
speaker
words
showed
such
knowledge
charity
and
sympathy
that
they
went
straight
to
my
heart
after
that
i
read
everything
of
paul
lessingham
which
i
came
across
and
the
more
i
read
the
more
i
was
impressed
but
it
was
some
time
before
we
met
considering
what
papa
opinions
were
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
go
out
of
his
way
to
facilitate
a
meeting
to
him
the
mere
mention
of
the
name
was
like
a
red
rag
to
a
bull
but
at
last
we
did
meet
and
then
i
knew
that
he
was
stronger
greater
better
even
than
his
words
it
is
so
often
the
other
way
one
finds
that
men
and
women
too
are
so
apt
to
put
their
best
as
it
were
into
their
shop
windows
that
the
discovery
was
as
novel
as
it
was
delightful
when
the
ice
was
once
broken
we
often
met
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
we
did
not
plan
our
meetings
at
first
at
any
rate
yet
we
seemed
always
meeting
seldom
a
day
passed
on
which
we
did
not
meet
sometimes
twice
or
thrice
it
was
odd
how
we
were
always
coming
across
each
other
in
the
most
unlikely
places
i
believe
we
did
not
notice
it
at
the
time
but
looking
back
i
can
see
that
we
must
have
managed
our
engagements
so
that
somewhere
somehow
we
should
be
certain
to
have
an
opportunity
of
exchanging
half
a
dozen
words
those
constant
encounters
could
not
have
all
been
chance
ones
but
i
never
supposed
he
loved
me
never
i
am
not
even
sure
that
for
some
time
i
was
aware
that
i
loved
him
we
were
great
on
friendship
both
of
i
was
quite
aware
that
i
was
his
friend
that
he
regarded
me
as
his
friend
he
told
me
so
more
than
once
tell
you
this
he
would
say
referring
to
this
that
or
the
other
i
know
that
in
speaking
to
you
i
am
speaking
to
a
friend
with
him
those
were
not
empty
words
all
kinds
of
people
talk
to
one
like
that
especially
men
it
is
a
kind
of
formula
which
they
use
with
every
woman
who
shows
herself
disposed
to
listen
but
paul
is
not
like
that
he
is
chary
of
speech
not
by
any
means
a
woman
man
i
tell
him
that
is
his
weakest
point
if
legend
does
not
lie
more
even
than
is
common
few
politicians
have
achieved
prosperity
without
the
aid
of
women
he
replies
that
he
is
not
a
politician
that
he
never
means
to
be
a
politician
he
simply
wishes
to
work
for
his
country
if
his
country
does
not
need
his
services
well
let
it
be
papa
political
friends
have
always
so
many
axes
of
their
own
to
grind
that
at
first
to
hear
a
member
of
parliament
talk
like
that
was
almost
disquieting
i
had
dreamed
of
men
like
that
but
i
never
encountered
one
till
i
met
paul
lessingham
our
friendship
was
a
pleasant
one
it
became
pleasanter
and
pleasanter
until
there
came
a
time
when
he
told
me
everything
the
dreams
he
dreamed
the
plans
which
he
had
planned
the
great
purposes
which
if
health
and
strength
were
given
him
he
intended
to
carry
to
a
great
fulfilment
and
at
last
he
told
me
something
else
it
was
after
a
meeting
at
a
working
women
club
in
westminster
he
had
spoken
and
i
had
spoken
too
i
do
know
what
papa
would
have
said
if
he
had
known
but
i
had
a
formal
resolution
had
been
proposed
and
i
had
seconded
it
in
perhaps
a
couple
of
hundred
words
but
that
would
have
been
quite
enough
for
papa
to
have
regarded
me
as
an
abandoned
wretch
papa
always
puts
those
sort
of
words
into
capitals
papa
regards
a
speechifying
woman
as
a
thing
of
horror
i
have
known
him
look
askance
at
a
primrose
dame
the
night
was
fine
paul
proposed
that
i
should
walk
with
him
down
the
westminster
bridge
road
until
we
reached
the
house
and
then
he
would
see
me
into
a
cab
i
did
as
he
suggested
it
was
still
early
not
yet
ten
and
the
streets
were
alive
with
people
our
conversation
as
we
went
was
entirely
political
the
agricultural
amendment
act
was
then
before
the
commons
and
paul
felt
very
strongly
that
it
was
one
of
those
measures
which
give
with
one
hand
while
taking
with
the
other
the
committee
stage
was
at
hand
and
already
several
amendments
were
threatened
the
effect
of
which
would
be
to
strengthen
the
landlord
at
the
expense
of
the
tenant
more
than
one
of
these
and
they
not
the
most
moderate
were
to
be
proposed
by
papa
paul
was
pointing
out
how
it
would
be
his
duty
to
oppose
these
tooth
and
nail
when
all
at
once
he
stopped
sometimes
wonder
how
you
really
feel
upon
this
matter
matter
the
difference
of
opinion
in
political
matters
which
exists
between
your
father
and
myself
i
am
conscious
that
mr
lindon
regards
my
action
as
a
personal
question
and
resents
it
so
keenly
that
i
am
sometimes
moved
to
wonder
if
at
least
a
portion
of
his
resentment
is
not
shared
by
you
have
explained
i
consider
papa
the
politician
as
one
person
and
papa
the
father
as
quite
another
are
his
daughter
i
am
but
would
you
on
that
account
wish
me
to
share
his
political
opinions
even
though
i
believe
them
to
be
wrong
love
him
course
i
do
he
is
the
best
of
fathers
defection
will
be
a
grievous
disappointment
i
looked
at
him
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
wondered
what
was
passing
through
his
mind
the
subject
of
my
relations
with
papa
was
one
which
without
saying
anything
at
all
about
it
we
had
consented
to
taboo
am
not
so
sure
i
am
permeated
with
a
suspicion
that
papa
has
no
politics
lindon
i
fancy
that
i
can
adduce
proof
to
the
contrary
believe
that
if
papa
were
to
marry
again
say
a
home
ruler
within
three
weeks
his
wife
politics
would
be
his
own
paul
thought
before
he
spoke
then
he
smiled
suppose
that
men
sometimes
do
change
their
coats
to
please
their
wives
even
their
political
ones
opinions
are
the
opinions
of
those
with
whom
he
mixes
the
reason
why
he
consorts
with
tories
of
the
crusted
school
is
because
he
fears
that
if
he
associated
with
anybody
else
with
radicals
say
before
he
knew
it
he
would
be
a
radical
too
with
him
association
is
synonymus
with
logic
paul
laughed
outright
by
this
time
we
had
reached
westminster
bridge
standing
we
looked
down
upon
the
river
a
long
line
of
lanterns
was
gliding
mysteriously
over
the
waters
it
was
a
tug
towing
a
string
of
barges
for
some
moments
neither
spoke
then
paul
recurred
to
what
i
had
just
been
saying
you
do
you
think
marriage
would
colour
your
convictions
it
yours
depends
he
was
silent
then
he
said
in
that
tone
which
i
had
learned
to
look
for
when
he
was
most
in
earnest
depends
on
whether
you
would
marry
me
i
was
still
his
words
were
so
unexpected
that
they
took
my
breath
away
i
knew
not
what
to
make
of
them
my
head
was
in
a
whirl
then
he
addressed
to
me
a
monosyllabic
interrogation
found
my
voice
or
a
part
of
it
to
what
he
came
a
little
closer
you
be
my
wife
the
part
of
my
voice
which
i
had
found
was
lost
again
tears
came
into
my
eyes
i
shivered
i
had
not
thought
that
i
could
be
so
absurd
just
then
the
moon
came
from
behind
a
cloud
the
rippling
waters
were
tipped
with
silver
he
spoke
again
so
gently
that
his
words
just
reached
my
ears
know
that
i
love
you
then
i
knew
that
i
loved
him
too
that
what
i
had
fancied
was
a
feeling
of
friendship
was
something
very
different
it
was
as
if
somebody
in
tearing
a
veil
from
before
my
eyes
had
revealed
a
spectacle
which
dazzled
me
i
was
speechless
he
misconstrued
my
silence
i
offended
you
i
fancy
that
he
noted
the
tremor
which
was
in
my
voice
and
read
it
rightly
for
he
too
was
still
presently
his
hand
stole
along
the
parapet
and
fastened
upon
mine
and
held
it
tight
and
that
was
how
it
came
about
other
things
were
said
but
they
were
hardly
of
the
first
importance
though
i
believe
we
took
some
time
in
saying
them
of
myself
i
can
say
with
truth
that
my
heart
was
too
full
for
copious
speech
i
was
dumb
with
a
great
happiness
and
i
believe
i
can
say
the
same
of
paul
he
told
me
as
much
when
we
were
parting
it
seemed
that
we
had
only
just
come
there
when
paul
started
turning
he
stared
up
at
big
ben
the
house
up
impossible
but
it
was
more
than
possible
it
was
fact
we
had
actually
been
on
the
bridge
two
hours
and
it
had
not
seemed
ten
minutes
never
had
i
supposed
that
the
flight
of
time
could
have
been
so
entirely
unnoticed
paul
was
considerably
taken
aback
his
legislative
conscience
pricked
him
he
excused
himself
in
his
own
fashion
for
once
in
a
way
my
business
in
the
house
was
not
so
important
as
my
business
out
of
it
he
had
his
arm
through
mine
we
were
standing
face
to
face
you
call
this
business
he
laughed
he
not
only
saw
me
into
a
cab
but
he
saw
me
home
in
it
and
in
the
cab
he
kissed
me
i
fancy
i
was
a
little
out
of
sorts
that
night
my
nervous
system
was
perhaps
demoralised
because
when
he
kissed
me
i
did
a
thing
which
i
never
do
i
have
my
own
standard
of
behaviour
and
that
sort
of
thing
is
quite
outside
of
it
i
behaved
like
a
sentimental
chit
i
cried
and
it
took
him
all
the
way
to
my
father
door
to
comfort
me
i
can
only
hope
that
perceiving
the
singularity
of
the
occasion
he
consented
to
excuse
me
chapter
xxiv
a
woman
view
sydney
atherton
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
it
is
not
only
annoying
worse
it
is
absurd
this
is
the
result
of
paul
wish
that
our
engagement
should
not
be
announced
he
is
afraid
of
papa
not
really
but
for
the
moment
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
is
charged
with
electricity
party
feeling
runs
high
they
are
at
each
other
hammer
and
tongs
about
this
agricultural
amendment
act
the
strain
on
paul
is
tremendous
i
am
beginning
to
feel
positively
concerned
little
things
which
i
have
noticed
about
him
lately
convince
me
that
he
is
being
overwrought
i
suspect
him
of
having
sleepless
nights
the
amount
of
work
which
he
has
been
getting
through
lately
has
been
too
much
for
any
single
human
being
i
care
not
who
he
is
he
himself
admits
that
he
shall
be
glad
when
the
session
is
at
an
end
so
shall
i
in
the
meantime
it
is
his
desire
that
nothing
shall
be
said
about
our
engagement
until
the
house
rises
it
is
reasonable
enough
papa
is
sure
to
be
violent
lately
the
barest
allusion
to
paul
name
has
been
enough
to
make
him
explode
when
the
discovery
does
come
he
will
be
unmanageable
i
foresee
it
clearly
from
little
incidents
which
have
happened
recently
i
predict
the
worst
he
will
be
capable
of
making
a
scene
within
the
precincts
of
the
house
and
as
paul
says
there
is
some
truth
in
the
saying
that
the
last
straw
breaks
the
camel
back
he
will
be
better
able
to
face
papa
wild
wrath
when
the
house
has
risen
so
the
news
is
to
bide
a
wee
of
course
paul
is
right
and
what
he
wishes
i
wish
too
still
it
is
not
all
such
plain
sailing
for
me
as
he
perhaps
thinks
the
domestic
atmosphere
is
almost
as
electrical
as
that
in
the
house
papa
is
like
the
terrier
who
scents
a
rat
he
is
always
sniffing
the
air
he
has
not
actually
forbidden
me
to
speak
to
paul
his
courage
is
not
quite
at
the
sticking
point
but
he
is
constantly
making
uncomfortable
allusions
to
persons
who
number
among
their
acquaintance
adventurers
and
that
kind
of
thing
sometimes
i
venture
to
call
my
soul
my
own
but
such
a
tempest
invariably
follows
that
i
become
discreet
again
as
soon
as
i
possibly
can
so
as
a
rule
i
suffer
in
silence
still
i
would
with
all
my
heart
that
the
concealment
were
at
an
end
no
one
need
imagine
that
i
am
ashamed
of
being
about
to
marry
paul
papa
least
of
all
on
the
contrary
i
am
as
proud
of
it
as
a
woman
can
be
sometimes
when
he
has
said
or
done
something
unusually
wonderful
i
fear
that
my
pride
will
out
i
do
feel
it
so
strong
within
me
i
should
be
delighted
to
have
a
trial
of
strength
with
papa
anywhere
at
any
time
i
should
not
be
so
rude
to
him
as
he
would
be
to
me
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
papa
knows
that
i
am
the
more
sensible
of
the
two
after
a
pitched
battle
or
so
he
would
understand
it
better
still
i
know
papa
i
have
not
been
his
daughter
for
all
these
years
in
vain
i
feel
like
soldiers
must
feel
who
burning
to
attack
the
enemy
in
the
open
field
are
ordered
to
skulk
behind
hedges
and
be
shot
at
one
result
is
that
sydney
has
actually
made
a
proposal
of
marriage
he
of
all
people
it
is
too
comical
the
best
of
it
was
that
he
took
himself
quite
seriously
i
do
not
know
how
many
times
he
has
confided
to
me
the
sufferings
which
he
has
endured
for
love
of
other
women
some
of
them
i
am
sorry
to
say
decent
married
women
too
but
this
is
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
theme
has
been
a
personal
one
he
was
so
frantic
as
he
is
wont
to
be
that
to
calm
him
i
told
him
about
paul
which
under
the
circumstances
to
him
i
felt
myself
at
liberty
to
do
in
return
he
was
melodramatic
hinting
darkly
at
i
know
not
what
i
was
almost
cross
with
him
he
is
a
curious
person
sydney
atherton
i
suppose
it
is
because
i
have
known
him
all
my
life
and
have
always
looked
upon
him
in
cases
of
necessity
as
a
capital
substitute
for
a
brother
that
i
criticise
him
with
so
much
frankness
in
some
respects
he
is
a
genius
in
others
i
will
not
write
fool
for
that
he
never
is
though
he
has
often
done
some
extremely
foolish
things
the
fame
of
his
inventions
is
in
the
mouths
of
all
men
though
the
half
of
them
has
never
been
told
he
is
the
most
extraordinary
mixture
the
things
which
most
people
would
like
to
have
proclaimed
in
the
street
he
keeps
tightly
locked
in
his
own
bosom
while
those
which
the
same
persons
would
be
only
too
glad
to
conceal
he
shouts
from
the
roofs
a
very
famous
man
once
told
me
that
if
mr
atherton
chose
to
become
a
specialist
to
take
up
one
branch
of
inquiry
and
devote
his
life
to
it
his
fame
before
he
died
would
bridge
the
spheres
but
sticking
to
one
thing
is
not
in
sydney
line
at
all
he
prefers
like
the
bee
to
roam
from
flower
to
flower
as
for
his
being
in
love
with
me
it
is
ridiculous
he
is
as
much
in
love
with
the
moon
i
can
not
think
what
has
put
the
idea
into
his
head
some
girl
must
have
been
him
or
he
imagines
that
she
has
the
girl
whom
he
ought
to
marry
and
whom
he
ultimately
will
marry
is
dora
grayling
she
is
young
charming
immensely
rich
and
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
him
if
she
were
not
then
he
would
be
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
i
believe
he
is
very
near
it
as
it
is
sometimes
he
is
so
very
rude
to
her
it
is
a
characteristic
of
sydney
that
he
is
apt
to
be
rude
to
a
girl
whom
he
really
likes
as
for
dora
i
suspect
she
dreams
of
him
he
is
tall
straight
very
handsome
with
a
big
moustache
and
the
most
extraordinary
eyes
i
fancy
that
those
eyes
of
his
have
as
much
to
do
with
dora
state
as
anything
i
have
heard
it
said
that
he
possesses
the
hypnotic
power
to
an
unusual
degree
and
that
if
he
chose
to
exercise
it
he
might
become
a
danger
to
society
i
believe
he
has
hypnotised
dora
he
makes
an
excellent
brother
i
have
gone
to
him
many
and
many
a
time
for
help
and
some
excellent
advice
i
have
received
i
daresay
i
shall
consult
him
still
there
are
matters
of
which
one
would
hardly
dare
to
talk
to
paul
in
all
things
he
is
the
great

the
man
in
the
street
this
morning
i
had
an
adventure
i
was
in
the
papa
as
usual
was
late
for
breakfast
and
i
was
wondering
whether
i
should
begin
without
him
when
chancing
to
look
round
something
caught
my
eye
in
the
street
i
went
to
the
window
to
see
what
it
was
a
small
crowd
of
people
was
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
they
were
all
staring
at
something
which
apparently
was
lying
on
the
ground
what
it
was
i
could
not
see
the
butler
happened
to
be
in
the
room
i
spoke
to
him
what
is
the
matter
in
the
street
go
and
see
he
went
and
saw
and
presently
he
returned
peter
is
an
excellent
servant
but
the
fashion
of
his
speech
even
when
conveying
the
most
trivial
information
is
slightly
sesquipedalian
he
would
have
made
a
capital
cabinet
minister
at
question
time
he
wraps
up
the
smallest
petitions
of
meaning
in
the
largest
possible
words
unfortunate
individual
appears
to
have
been
the
victim
of
a
catastrophe
i
am
informed
that
he
is
dead
the
constable
asserts
that
he
is
drunk
dead
do
you
mean
that
he
is
dead
drunk
at
this
hour
is
either
one
or
the
other
i
did
not
behold
the
individual
myself
i
derived
my
information
from
a
bystander
that
was
not
sufficiently
explicit
for
me
i
gave
way
to
a
seemingly
quite
causeless
impulse
of
curiosity
i
went
out
into
the
street
just
as
i
was
to
see
for
myself
it
was
perhaps
not
the
most
sensible
thing
i
could
have
done
and
papa
would
have
been
shocked
but
i
am
always
shocking
papa
it
had
been
raining
in
the
night
and
the
shoes
which
i
had
on
were
not
so
well
suited
as
they
might
have
been
for
an
encounter
with
the
mud
i
made
my
way
to
the
point
of
interest
the
matter
i
asked
a
workman
with
a
bag
of
tools
over
his
shoulder
answered
me
something
wrong
with
someone
policeman
says
he
drunk
but
he
looks
to
me
as
if
he
was
something
worse
you
let
me
pass
please
when
they
saw
i
was
a
woman
they
permitted
me
to
reach
the
centre
of
the
crowd
a
man
was
lying
on
his
back
in
the
grease
and
dirt
of
the
road
he
was
so
plastered
with
mud
that
it
was
difficult
at
first
to
be
sure
that
he
really
was
a
man
his
head
and
feet
were
bare
his
body
was
partially
covered
by
a
long
ragged
cloak
it
was
obvious
that
that
one
wretched
sopping
wet
rag
was
all
the
clothing
he
had
on
a
huge
constable
was
holding
his
shoulders
in
his
hands
and
was
regarding
him
as
if
he
could
not
make
him
out
at
all
he
seemed
uncertain
as
to
whether
it
was
or
was
not
a
case
of
shamming
he
spoke
to
him
as
if
he
had
been
some
refractory
child
my
lad
this
wo
do
wake
up
what
the
matter
but
he
neither
woke
up
nor
explained
what
was
the
matter
i
took
hold
of
his
hand
it
was
icy
cold
apparently
the
wrist
was
pulseless
clearly
this
was
no
ordinary
case
of
drunkenness
is
something
seriously
wrong
officer
medical
assistance
ought
to
be
had
at
once
you
think
he
in
a
fit
miss
a
doctor
should
be
able
to
tell
you
better
than
i
can
there
seems
to
be
no
pulse
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
he
was
the
word
was
actually
on
my
lips
when
the
stranger
saved
me
from
making
a
glaring
exposure
of
my
ignorance
by
snatching
his
wrist
away
from
me
and
sitting
up
in
the
mud
he
held
out
his
hands
in
front
of
him
opened
his
eyes
and
exclaimed
in
a
loud
but
painfully
raucous
tone
of
voice
as
if
he
was
suffering
from
a
very
bad
cold
lessingham
i
was
so
surprised
that
i
all
but
sat
down
in
the
mud
to
hear
paul
my
paul
apostrophised
by
an
individual
of
his
appearance
in
that
fashion
was
something
which
i
had
not
expected
directly
the
words
were
uttered
he
closed
his
eyes
again
sank
backward
and
seemingly
relapsed
into
unconsciousness
the
constable
gripping
him
by
the
shoulder
just
in
time
to
prevent
him
banging
the
back
of
his
head
against
the
road
the
officer
shook
him
scarcely
gently
my
lad
it
plain
that
you
not
dead
what
the
meaning
of
this
move
yourself
looking
round
i
found
that
peter
was
close
behind
apparently
he
had
been
struck
by
the
singularity
of
his
mistress
behaviour
and
had
followed
to
see
that
it
did
not
meet
with
the
reward
which
it
deserved
i
spoke
to
him
let
someone
go
at
once
for
dr
cotes
dr
cotes
lives
just
round
the
corner
and
since
it
was
evident
that
the
man
lapse
into
consciousness
had
made
the
policeman
sceptical
as
to
his
case
being
so
serious
as
it
seemed
i
thought
it
might
be
advisable
that
a
competent
opinion
should
be
obtained
without
delay
peter
was
starting
when
again
the
stranger
returned
to
consciousness
that
is
if
it
really
was
consciousness
as
to
which
i
was
more
than
a
little
in
doubt
he
repeated
his
previous
pantomime
sat
up
in
the
mud
stretched
out
his
arms
opened
his
eyes
unnaturally
wide
and
yet
they
appeared
unseeing
a
sort
of
convulsion
went
all
over
him
and
he
shrieked
it
really
amounted
to
shrieking
as
a
man
might
shriek
who
was
in
mortal
terror
warned
paul
lessingham
be
warned
for
my
part
that
settled
it
there
was
a
mystery
here
which
needed
to
be
unravelled
twice
had
he
called
upon
paul
name
and
in
the
strangest
fashion
it
was
for
me
to
learn
the
why
and
the
wherefore
to
ascertain
what
connection
there
was
between
this
lifeless
creature
and
paul
lessingham
providence
might
have
cast
him
there
before
my
door
i
might
be
entertaining
an
angel
unawares
my
mind
was
made
up
on
the
instant
hasten
for
dr
cotes
peter
passed
the
word
and
immediately
a
footman
started
running
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
i
will
have
this
man
taken
into
my
father
will
some
of
you
men
help
to
carry
him
there
were
volunteers
enough
and
to
spare
i
spoke
to
peter
in
the
hall
papa
down
yet
lindon
has
sent
down
to
say
that
you
will
please
not
wait
for
him
for
breakfast
he
has
issued
instructions
to
have
his
breakfast
conveyed
to
him
upstairs
all
right
i
nodded
towards
the
poor
wretch
who
was
being
carried
through
the
hall
will
say
nothing
to
him
about
this
unless
he
particularly
asks
you
understand
peter
bowed
he
is
discretion
itself
he
knows
i
have
my
vagaries
and
it
is
not
his
fault
if
the
savour
of
them
travels
to
papa
the
doctor
was
in
the
house
almost
as
soon
as
the
stranger
washing
he
remarked
directly
he
saw
him
and
that
certainly
was
true
i
never
saw
a
man
who
stood
more
obviously
in
need
of
the
good
offices
of
soap
and
water
then
he
went
through
the
usual
medical
formula
i
watching
all
the
while
so
far
as
i
could
see
the
man
showed
not
the
slightest
sign
of
life
he
dead
will
be
soon
if
he
does
have
something
to
eat
the
starving
the
doctor
asked
the
policeman
what
he
knew
of
him
that
sagacious
officer
reply
was
vague
a
boy
had
run
up
to
him
crying
that
a
man
was
lying
dead
in
the
street
he
had
straightway
followed
the
boy
and
discovered
the
stranger
that
was
all
he
knew
is
the
matter
with
the
man
i
inquired
of
the
doctor
when
the
constable
had
gone
it
may
be
catalepsy
and
it
when
i
do
know
you
may
ask
again
dr
cotes
manner
was
a
trifle
brusque
particularly
i
believe
to
me
i
remember
that
once
he
threatened
to
box
my
ears
when
i
was
a
small
child
i
used
to
think
nothing
of
boxing
his
realising
that
no
satisfaction
was
to
be
got
out
of
a
speechless
man
particularly
as
regards
his
mysterious
references
to
paul
i
went
upstairs
i
found
that
papa
was
under
the
impression
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
severe
attack
of
gout
but
as
he
was
eating
a
capital
breakfast
and
apparently
enjoying
it
while
i
was
still
fasting
i
ventured
to
hope
that
the
matter
was
not
so
serious
as
he
feared
i
mentioned
nothing
to
him
about
the
person
whom
i
had
found
in
the
street
lest
it
should
aggravate
his
gout
when
he
is
like
that
the
slightest
thing
does
chapter

a
father
no
paul
has
stormed
the
house
of
commons
with
one
of
the
greatest
speeches
which
even
he
has
delivered
and
i
have
quarrelled
with
papa
and
also
i
have
very
nearly
quarrelled
with
sydney
sydney
little
affair
is
nothing
he
actually
still
persists
in
thinking
himself
in
love
with
me
as
if
since
last
night
when
he
what
he
calls
to
me
he
has
not
time
to
fall
out
of
love
and
in
again
half
a
dozen
times
and
on
the
strength
of
it
he
seems
to
consider
himself
entitled
to
make
himself
as
disagreeable
as
he
can
that
i
should
not
mind
for
sydney
disagreeable
is
about
as
nice
as
sydney
any
other
way
but
when
it
comes
to
his
shooting
poisoned
shafts
at
paul
i
object
if
he
imagines
that
anything
he
can
say
or
hint
will
lessen
my
estimation
of
paul
lessingham
by
one
hair
breadth
he
has
less
wisdom
even
than
i
gave
him
credit
for
by
the
way
percy
woodville
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
tonight
which
also
is
nothing
he
has
been
trying
to
do
it
for
the
last
three
years
though
under
the
circumstances
it
is
a
little
trying
but
he
would
not
spit
venom
merely
because
i
preferred
another
man
and
he
i
believe
does
care
for
me
papa
affair
is
serious
it
is
the
first
clashing
of
the
foils
and
this
time
i
imagine
the
buttons
are
really
off
this
morning
he
said
a
few
words
not
so
much
to
as
at
me
he
informed
me
that
paul
was
expected
to
speak
as
if
i
did
not
know
it
and
availed
himself
of
the
opening
to
load
him
with
the
abuse
which
in
his
case
he
thinks
is
not
unbecoming
to
a
gentleman
i
do
know
or
rather
i
do
know
what
he
would
think
if
he
heard
another
man
use
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
the
kind
of
language
which
he
habitually
employs
however
i
said
nothing
i
had
a
motive
for
allowing
the
chaff
to
fly
before
the
wind
but
issue
was
joined
i
of
course
went
to
hear
paul
speak
as
i
have
done
over
and
over
again
before
afterwards
paul
came
and
fetched
me
from
the
cage
he
had
to
leave
me
for
a
moment
while
he
gave
somebody
a
message
and
in
the
lobby
there
was
sydney
all
sneers
i
could
have
pinched
him
just
as
i
was
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
i
should
have
to
stick
a
pin
into
his
arm
paul
returned
and
positively
sydney
was
rude
to
him
i
was
ashamed
if
mr
atherton
was
not
as
if
it
was
not
enough
that
he
should
be
insulted
by
a
mere
popinjay
at
the
very
moment
when
he
had
been
adding
another
stone
to
the
fabric
of
his
glory
papa
came
up
he
actually
wanted
to
take
me
away
from
paul
i
should
have
liked
to
see
him
do
it
of
course
i
went
down
with
paul
to
the
carriage
leaving
papa
to
follow
if
he
chose
he
did
not
choose
but
none
the
less
he
managed
to
be
home
within
three
minutes
after
i
had
myself
returned
then
the
battle
began
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
an
idea
of
papa
in
a
rage
there
may
be
men
who
look
well
when
they
lose
their
temper
but
if
there
are
papa
is
certainly
not
one
he
is
always
talking
about
the
magnificence
and
the
high
breeding
of
the
lindons
but
anything
less
than
the
head
of
the
lindons
in
his
moments
of
wrath
it
would
be
hard
to
conceive
his
language
i
will
not
attempt
to
portray
but
his
observations
consisted
mainly
of
abuse
of
paul
glorification
of
the
lindons
and
orders
to
me
forbid
you
i
forbid
you
when
papa
wishes
to
be
impressive
he
repeats
his
own
words
three
or
four
times
over
i
do
know
if
he
imagines
that
they
are
improved
by
repetition
if
he
does
he
is
wrong
forbid
you
ever
again
to
speak
to
that
that
that
here
followed
language
i
was
silent
my
cue
was
to
keep
cool
i
believe
that
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
being
a
little
white
and
exceedingly
sorry
that
papa
should
so
forget
himself
i
was
about
the
same
as
i
generally
am
you
hear
me
do
you
hear
what
i
say
do
you
hear
me
miss
papa
i
hear
you
then
then
promise
me
promise
that
you
will
do
as
i
tell
you
mark
my
words
my
girl
you
shall
promise
before
you
leave
this
room
dear
papa
do
you
intend
me
to
spend
the
remainder
of
my
life
in
the
you
be
impertinent
you
speak
to
me
like
that
i
i
i
wo
have
it
tell
you
what
it
is
papa
if
you
do
take
care
you
have
another
attack
of
gout
gout
that
was
the
most
sensible
thing
he
said
if
such
a
tormentor
as
gout
can
be
consigned
to
the
nether
regions
by
the
mere
utterance
of
a
word
by
all
means
let
the
word
be
uttered
off
he
went
again
man
a
ruffianly
rascally
and
so
on
not
such
a
villainous
vagabond
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
order
you
i
a
lindon
and
i
order
you
i
your
father
and
i
order
you
i
order
you
never
to
speak
to
such
a
such
a
various
vain
repetitions
and
and
and
i
order
you
never
to
look
at
him
to
me
papa
i
will
promise
you
never
to
speak
to
paul
lessingham
again
if
you
will
promise
me
never
to
speak
to
lord
cantilever
again
or
to
recognise
him
if
you
meet
him
in
the
street
should
have
seen
how
papa
glared
lord
cantilever
is
the
head
of
his
party
its
august
and
i
presume
reverenced
leader
he
is
particular
fetish
i
am
not
sure
that
he
does
regard
him
as
being
any
lower
than
the
angels
but
if
he
does
it
is
certainly
something
in
decimals
my
suggestion
seemed
as
outrageous
to
him
as
his
suggestion
seemed
to
me
but
it
is
papa
misfortune
that
he
can
only
see
one
side
of
a
question
and
that
his
own
you
dare
to
compare
lord
cantilever
to
to
that
that
that
am
not
comparing
them
i
am
not
aware
of
there
being
anything
in
particular
against
lord
cantilever
that
is
against
his
character
but
of
course
i
should
not
dream
of
comparing
a
man
of
his
calibre
with
one
of
real
ability
like
paul
lessingham
it
would
be
to
treat
his
lordship
with
too
much
severity
i
could
not
help
it
but
that
did
it
the
rest
of
papa
conversation
was
a
jumble
of
explosions
it
was
all
so
sad
papa
poured
all
the
vials
of
his
wrath
upon
paul
to
his
own
sore
disfigurement
he
threatened
me
with
all
the
pains
and
penalties
of
the
inquisition
if
i
did
not
immediately
promise
to
hold
no
further
communication
with
mr
lessingham
of
course
i
did
nothing
of
the
kind
he
cursed
me
in
default
by
bell
book
and
candle
and
by
ever
so
many
other
things
beside
he
called
me
the
most
dreadful
names
me
his
only
child
he
warned
me
that
i
should
find
myself
in
prison
before
i
had
done
i
am
not
sure
that
he
did
not
hint
darkly
at
the
gallows
finally
he
drove
me
from
the
room
in
a
whirlwind
of
anathemas
chapter
xxvii
the
terror
by
night
when
i
left
papa
or
rather
when
papa
had
driven
me
from
him
i
went
straight
to
the
man
whom
i
had
found
in
the
street
it
was
late
and
i
was
feeling
both
tired
and
worried
so
that
i
only
thought
of
seeing
for
myself
how
he
was
in
some
way
he
seemed
to
be
a
link
between
paul
and
myself
and
as
at
that
moment
links
of
that
kind
were
precious
i
could
not
have
gone
to
bed
without
learning
something
of
his
condition
the
nurse
received
me
at
the
door
nurse
how
the
patient
nurse
was
a
plump
motherly
woman
who
had
attended
more
than
one
odd
protege
of
mine
and
whom
i
kept
pretty
constantly
at
my
beck
and
call
she
held
out
her
hands
hard
to
tell
he
has
moved
since
i
came
moved
is
he
still
insensible
seems
to
me
to
be
in
some
sort
of
trance
he
does
not
appear
to
breathe
and
i
can
detect
no
pulsation
but
the
doctor
says
he
still
alive
it
the
queerest
case
i
ever
saw
i
went
farther
into
the
room
directly
i
did
so
the
man
in
the
bed
gave
signs
of
life
which
were
sufficiently
unmistakable
nurse
hastened
to
him
she
exclaimed
moving
he
might
have
heard
you
enter
he
not
only
might
have
done
but
it
seemed
possible
that
that
was
what
he
actually
had
done
as
i
approached
the
bed
he
raised
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
as
in
the
morning
he
had
done
in
the
street
and
he
exclaimed
as
if
he
addressed
himself
to
someone
whom
he
saw
in
front
of
him
i
can
not
describe
the
almost
more
than
human
agony
which
was
in
his
voice
lessingham
beware
the
beetle
what
he
meant
i
had
not
the
slightest
notion
probably
that
was
why
what
seemed
more
like
a
pronouncement
of
delirium
than
anything
else
had
such
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
my
nerves
no
sooner
had
he
spoken
than
a
sort
of
blank
horror
seemed
to
settle
down
upon
my
mind
i
actually
found
myself
trembling
at
the
knees
i
felt
all
at
once
as
if
i
was
standing
in
the
immediate
presence
of
something
awful
yet
unseen
as
for
the
speaker
no
sooner
were
the
words
out
of
his
lips
than
as
was
the
case
in
the
morning
he
relapsed
into
a
condition
of
trance
nurse
bending
over
him
announced
the
fact
gone
off
again
what
an
extraordinary
thing
i
suppose
it
is
real
it
was
clear
from
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
she
shared
the
doubt
which
had
troubled
the
policeman
not
a
trace
of
a
pulse
from
the
look
of
things
he
might
be
dead
of
one
thing
i
sure
that
there
something
unnatural
about
the
man
no
natural
illness
i
ever
heard
of
takes
hold
of
a
man
like
this
glancing
up
she
saw
that
there
was
something
unusual
in
my
face
an
appearance
which
startled
her
miss
marjorie
what
the
matter
you
look
quite
ill
i
felt
ill
and
worse
than
ill
but
at
the
same
time
i
was
quite
incapable
of
describing
what
i
felt
to
nurse
for
some
inscrutable
reason
i
had
even
lost
the
control
of
my
tongue
i
stammered
i
i
not
feeling
very
well
nurse
i
i
i
think
i
be
better
in
bed
as
i
spoke
i
staggered
towards
the
door
conscious
all
the
while
that
nurse
was
staring
at
me
with
eyes
wide
open
when
i
got
out
of
the
room
it
seemed
in
some
incomprehensible
fashion
as
if
something
had
left
it
with
me
and
that
it
and
i
were
alone
together
in
the
corridor
so
overcome
was
i
by
the
consciousness
of
its
immediate
propinquity
that
all
at
once
i
found
myself
cowering
against
the
wall
as
if
i
expected
something
or
someone
to
strike
me
how
i
reached
my
bedroom
i
do
not
know
i
found
fanchette
awaiting
me
for
the
moment
her
presence
was
a
positive
comfort
until
i
realised
the
amazement
with
which
she
was
regarding
me
is
not
well
you
fanchette
i
i
am
rather
tired
i
will
undress
myself
you
can
go
to
bed
if
mademoiselle
is
so
tired
will
she
not
permit
me
to
assist
her
the
suggestion
was
reasonable
enough
and
kindly
too
for
to
say
the
least
of
it
she
had
as
much
cause
for
fatigue
as
i
had
i
hesitated
i
should
have
liked
to
throw
my
arms
about
her
neck
and
beg
her
not
to
leave
me
but
the
plain
truth
is
i
was
ashamed
in
my
inner
consciousness
i
was
persuaded
that
the
sense
of
terror
which
had
suddenly
come
over
me
was
so
absolutely
causeless
that
i
could
not
bear
the
notion
of
playing
the
craven
in
my
maid
eyes
while
i
hesitated
something
seemed
to
sweep
past
me
through
the
air
and
to
brush
against
my
cheek
in
passing
i
caught
at
fanchette
arm
is
there
something
with
us
in
the
room
with
us
in
the
room
mademoiselle
what
does
mademoiselle
mean
she
looked
disturbed
which
was
on
the
whole
excusable
fanchette
is
not
exactly
a
person
and
not
likely
to
be
much
of
a
support
when
a
support
was
most
required
if
i
was
going
to
play
the
fool
i
would
be
my
own
audience
so
i
sent
her
off
you
not
hear
me
tell
you
that
i
will
undress
myself
you
are
to
go
to
bed
she
went
to
bed
with
quite
sufficient
willingness
the
instant
that
she
was
out
of
the
room
i
wished
that
she
was
back
again
such
a
paroxysm
of
fear
came
over
me
that
i
was
incapable
of
stirring
from
the
spot
on
which
i
stood
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
prevent
myself
from
collapsing
in
heap
on
the
floor
i
had
never
till
then
had
reason
to
suppose
that
i
was
a
coward
nor
to
suspect
myself
of
being
the
possessor
of
i
was
as
little
likely
as
anyone
to
be
frightened
by
shadows
i
told
myself
that
the
whole
thing
was
sheer
absurdity
and
that
i
should
be
thoroughly
ashamed
of
my
own
conduct
when
the
morning
came
you
do
want
to
be
as
a
contemptible
idiot
marjorie
lindon
you
will
call
up
your
courage
and
these
foolish
fears
will
fly
but
it
would
not
do
instead
of
flying
they
grew
worse
i
became
convinced
and
the
process
of
conviction
was
terrible
beyond
words
that
there
actually
was
something
with
me
in
the
room
some
invisible
horror
which
at
any
moment
might
become
visible
i
seemed
to
understand
with
a
sense
of
agony
which
nothing
can
describe
that
this
thing
which
was
with
me
was
with
paul
that
we
were
linked
together
by
the
bond
of
a
common
and
a
dreadful
terror
that
at
that
moment
that
same
awful
peril
which
was
threatening
me
was
threatening
him
and
that
i
was
powerless
to
move
a
finger
in
his
aid
as
with
a
sort
of
second
sight
i
saw
out
of
the
room
in
which
i
was
into
another
in
which
paul
was
crouching
on
the
floor
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
and
shrieking
the
vision
came
again
and
again
with
a
degree
of
vividness
of
which
i
can
not
give
the
least
conception
at
last
the
horror
and
the
reality
of
it
goaded
me
to
frenzy
paul
i
screamed
as
soon
as
i
found
my
voice
the
vision
faded
once
more
i
understood
that
as
a
matter
of
simple
fact
i
was
standing
in
my
own
bedroom
that
the
lights
were
burning
brightly
that
i
had
not
yet
commenced
to
remove
a
particle
of
dress
i
going
mad
i
wondered
i
had
heard
of
insanity
taking
extraordinary
forms
but
what
could
have
caused
softening
of
the
brain
in
me
i
had
not
the
faintest
notion
surely
that
sort
of
thing
does
not
come
on
one
in
such
a
wholly
unmitigated
form
without
the
slightest
notice
and
that
my
mental
faculties
were
sound
enough
a
few
minutes
back
i
was
certain
the
first
premonition
of
anything
of
the
kind
had
come
upon
me
with
the
melodramatic
utterance
of
the
man
i
had
found
in
the
street
lessingham
beware
the
beetle
the
words
were
ringing
in
my
what
was
that
there
was
a
buzzing
sound
behind
me
i
turned
to
see
what
it
was
it
moved
as
i
moved
so
that
it
was
still
at
my
back
i
swung
swiftly
right
round
on
my
heels
it
still
eluded
me
it
was
still
behind
i
stood
and
listened
what
was
it
that
hovered
so
persistently
at
my
back
the
buzzing
was
distinctly
audible
it
was
like
the
humming
of
a
bee
or
could
it
be
a
beetle
my
whole
life
long
i
have
had
an
antipathy
to
beetles
of
any
sort
or
kind
i
have
objected
neither
to
rats
nor
mice
nor
cows
nor
bulls
nor
snakes
nor
spiders
nor
toads
nor
lizards
nor
any
of
the
thousand
and
one
other
creatures
animate
or
otherwise
to
which
so
many
people
have
a
rooted
and
apparently
illogical
dislike
my
pet
and
only
horror
has
been
beetles
the
mere
suspicion
of
a
harmless
and
i
am
told
necessary
cockroach
being
within
several
feet
has
always
made
me
seriously
uneasy
the
thought
that
a
great
winged
beetle
to
me
a
flying
beetle
is
the
horror
of
horrors
was
with
me
in
my
bedroom
goodness
alone
knew
how
it
had
got
there
was
unendurable
anyone
who
had
beheld
me
during
the
next
few
moments
would
certainly
have
supposed
i
was
deranged
i
turned
and
twisted
sprang
from
side
to
side
screwed
myself
into
impossible
positions
in
order
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
detested
visitant
but
in
vain
i
could
hear
it
all
the
time
but
see
it
never
the
buzzing
sound
was
continually
behind
the
terror
returned
i
began
to
think
that
my
brain
must
be
softening
i
dashed
to
the
bed
flinging
myself
on
my
knees
i
tried
to
pray
but
i
was
speechless
words
would
not
come
my
thoughts
would
not
take
shape
i
all
at
once
became
conscious
as
i
struggled
to
ask
help
of
god
that
i
was
wrestling
with
something
evil
that
if
i
only
could
ask
kelp
of
him
evil
would
flee
but
i
could
not
i
was
helpless
overmastered
i
hid
my
face
in
the
bedclothes
cramming
my
fingers
into
my
ears
but
the
buzzing
was
behind
me
all
the
time
i
sprang
up
striking
out
blindly
wildly
right
and
left
hitting
nothing
the
buzzing
always
came
from
a
point
at
which
at
the
moment
i
was
not
aiming
i
tore
off
my
clothes
i
had
on
a
lovely
frock
which
i
had
worn
for
the
first
time
that
night
i
had
had
it
specially
made
for
the
occasion
of
the
duchess
ball
and
more
especially
in
honour
of
paul
great
speech
i
had
said
to
myself
when
i
saw
my
image
in
a
mirror
that
it
was
the
most
exquisite
gown
i
had
ever
had
that
it
suited
me
to
perfection
and
that
it
should
continue
in
my
wardrobe
for
many
a
day
if
only
as
a
souvenir
of
a
memorable
night
now
in
the
madness
of
my
terror
all
reflections
of
that
sort
were
forgotten
my
only
desire
was
to
away
with
it
i
tore
it
off
anyhow
letting
it
fall
in
rags
on
the
floor
at
my
feet
all
else
that
i
had
on
i
flung
in
the
same
way
after
it
it
was
a
veritable
holocaust
of
dainty
garments
i
acting
as
relentless
executioner
who
am
as
a
rule
so
tender
with
my
things
i
leaped
upon
the
bed
switched
off
the
electric
light
hurried
into
bed
burying
myself
over
head
and
all
deep
down
between
the
sheets
i
had
hoped
that
by
shutting
out
the
light
i
might
regain
my
senses
that
in
the
darkness
i
might
have
opportunity
for
sane
reflection
but
i
had
made
a
grievous
error
i
had
exchanged
bad
for
worse
the
darkness
lent
added
terrors
the
light
had
not
been
out
five
seconds
before
i
would
have
given
all
that
i
was
worth
to
be
able
to
switch
it
on
again
as
i
cowered
beneath
the
bedclothes
i
heard
the
buzzing
sound
above
my
head
the
sudden
silence
of
the
darkness
had
rendered
it
more
audible
than
it
had
been
before
the
thing
whatever
it
was
was
hovering
above
the
bed
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
it
grew
clearer
and
clearer
i
felt
it
alight
upon
the
coverlet
shall
i
ever
forget
the
sensations
with
which
i
did
feel
it
it
weighed
upon
me
like
a
ton
of
lead
how
much
of
the
seeming
weight
was
real
and
how
much
imaginary
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
but
that
it
was
much
heavier
than
any
beetle
i
have
ever
seen
or
heard
of
i
am
sure
for
a
time
it
was
still
and
during
that
time
i
doubt
if
i
even
drew
my
breath
then
i
felt
it
begin
to
move
in
wobbling
fashion
with
awkward
ungainly
gait
stopping
every
now
and
then
as
if
for
rest
i
was
conscious
that
it
was
progressing
slowly
yet
surely
towards
the
head
of
the
bed
the
emotion
of
horror
with
which
i
realised
what
this
progression
might
mean
will
be
i
fear
with
me
to
the
end
of
my
life
not
only
in
dreams
but
too
often
also
in
my
waking
hours
my
heart
as
the
psalmist
has
it
melted
like
wax
within
me
i
was
incapable
of
movement
dominated
by
something
as
hideous
as
and
infinitely
more
powerful
than
the
fascination
of
the
serpent
when
it
reached
the
head
of
the
bed
what
i
feared
with
what
a
fear
would
happen
did
happen
it
began
to
find
its
way
inside
to
creep
between
the
sheets
the
wonder
is
i
did
not
die
i
felt
it
coming
nearer
and
nearer
inch
by
inch
i
knew
that
it
was
upon
me
that
escape
there
was
none
i
felt
something
touch
my
hair
and
then
oblivion
did
come
to
my
aid
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
swooned
chapter
xxviii
the
strange
story
of
the
man
in
the
street
i
have
been
anticipating
for
some
weeks
past
that
things
would
become
exciting
and
they
have
but
hardly
in
the
way
which
i
foresaw
it
is
the
old
story
of
the
unexpected
happening
suddenly
events
of
the
most
extraordinary
nature
have
come
crowding
on
me
from
the
most
quarters
let
me
try
to
take
them
in
something
like
their
proper
order
to
begin
with
sydney
has
behaved
very
badly
so
badly
that
it
seems
likely
that
i
shall
have
to
my
whole
conception
of
his
character
it
was
nearly
nine
this
morning
when
i
i
can
not
say
woke
up
because
i
do
not
believe
that
i
had
really
been
asleep
but
when
i
returned
to
consciousness
i
found
myself
sitting
up
in
bed
trembling
like
some
frightened
child
what
had
actually
happened
to
me
i
did
not
know
could
not
guess
i
was
conscious
of
an
overwhelming
sense
of
nausea
and
generally
i
was
feeling
very
far
from
well
i
endeavoured
to
arrange
my
thoughts
and
to
decide
upon
some
plan
of
action
finally
i
decided
to
go
for
advice
and
help
where
i
had
so
often
gone
before
to
sydney
atherton
i
went
to
him
i
told
him
the
whole
gruesome
story
he
saw
he
could
not
help
but
see
what
a
deep
impress
the
events
of
the
night
had
made
on
me
he
heard
me
to
the
end
with
every
appearance
of
sympathy
and
then
all
at
once
i
discovered
that
all
the
time
papa
had
been
concealed
behind
a
large
screen
which
was
in
the
room
listening
to
every
word
i
had
been
uttering
that
i
was
dumfoundered
goes
without
saying
it
was
bad
enough
in
papa
but
in
sydney
it
seemed
and
it
was
such
treachery
he
and
i
have
told
each
other
secrets
all
our
lives
it
has
never
entered
my
imagination
as
he
very
well
knows
to
play
him
false
in
one
jot
or
tittle
and
i
have
always
understood
that
in
this
sort
of
matter
men
pride
themselves
on
their
sense
of
honour
being
so
much
keener
than
women
i
told
them
some
plain
truths
and
i
fancy
that
i
left
them
both
feeling
heartily
ashamed
of
themselves
one
result
the
experience
had
on
me
it
wound
me
up
it
had
on
me
the
revivifying
effect
of
a
cold
douche
i
realised
that
mine
was
a
situation
in
which
i
should
have
to
help
myself
when
i
returned
home
i
learned
that
the
man
whom
i
had
found
in
the
street
was
himself
again
and
was
as
conscious
as
he
was
ever
likely
to
be
burning
with
curiosity
to
learn
the
nature
of
the
connection
which
existed
between
paul
and
him
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
his
oracular
apostrophes
i
merely
paused
to
remove
my
hat
before
hastening
into
his
apartment
when
he
saw
me
and
heard
who
i
was
the
expressions
of
his
gratitude
were
painful
in
their
intensity
the
tears
streamed
down
his
cheeks
he
looked
to
me
like
a
man
who
had
very
little
life
left
in
him
he
looked
weak
and
white
and
worn
to
a
shadow
probably
he
never
had
been
robust
and
it
was
only
too
plain
that
privation
had
robbed
him
of
what
little
strength
he
had
ever
had
he
was
nothing
else
but
skin
and
bone
physical
and
mental
debility
was
written
large
all
over
him
he
was
not
in
a
milk
and
watery
sort
of
way
he
had
pale
blue
eyes
and
very
fair
hair
and
i
daresay
at
one
time
had
been
a
spruce
enough
clerk
it
was
difficult
to
guess
his
age
one
ages
so
rapidly
under
the
stress
of
misfortune
but
i
should
have
set
him
down
as
being
about
forty
his
voice
though
faint
enough
at
first
was
that
of
an
educated
man
and
as
he
went
on
and
gathered
courage
and
became
more
and
more
in
earnest
he
spoke
with
a
simple
directness
which
was
close
akin
to
eloquence
it
was
a
curious
story
which
he
had
to
tell
so
curious
so
astounding
indeed
that
by
the
time
it
was
finished
i
was
in
such
a
state
of
mind
that
i
could
perceive
no
alternative
but
to
forgive
sydney
and
in
spite
of
his
recent
and
scandalous
misbehaviour
again
appeal
to
him
for
assistance
it
seemed
if
the
story
told
by
the
man
whom
i
had
found
in
the
street
was
true
and
incredible
though
it
sounded
he
spoke
like
a
truthful
man
that
paul
was
threatened
by
some
dreadful
and
to
me
wholly
incomprehensible
danger
that
it
was
a
case
in
which
even
moments
were
precious
and
i
felt
that
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
it
was
a
position
in
which
i
could
not
move
alone
the
shadow
of
the
terror
of
the
night
was
with
me
still
and
with
that
fresh
in
my
recollection
how
could
i
hope
to
act
effectually
against
the
mysterious
being
of
whom
this
amazing
tale
was
told
no
i
believed
that
sydney
did
care
for
me
in
his
own
peculiar
way
i
knew
that
he
was
quick
and
cool
and
fertile
in
resource
and
that
he
showed
to
most
advantage
in
a
difficult
situation
it
was
possible
that
he
had
a
conscience
of
a
sort
and
that
this
time
i
might
not
appeal
to
it
in
vain
so
i
sent
a
servant
off
to
fetch
him
helter
skelter
as
luck
would
have
it
the
servant
returned
with
him
within
five
minutes
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
lunching
with
dora
grayling
who
lives
just
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
the
footman
had
met
him
coming
down
the
steps
i
had
him
shown
into
my
own
room
want
you
to
go
to
the
man
whom
i
found
in
the
street
and
listen
to
what
he
has
to
say
pleasure
i
trust
you
listen
to
what
he
has
to
say
i
believe
so
i
trust
you
to
respect
my
confidence
he
was
not
at
all
abashed
i
never
saw
sydney
atherton
when
he
was
abashed
whatever
the
offence
of
which
he
has
been
guilty
he
always
seems
completely
at
his
ease
his
eyes
twinkled
can
i
will
not
breathe
a
syllable
even
to
papa
that
case
come
but
you
understand
i
am
going
to
put
to
the
test
the
affirmations
which
you
have
made
during
all
these
years
and
to
prove
if
you
have
any
of
the
feeling
for
me
which
you
pretend
directly
we
were
in
the
stranger
room
sydney
marched
straight
up
to
the
bed
stared
at
the
man
who
was
lying
in
it
crammed
his
hands
into
his
trouser
pockets
and
whistled
i
was
amazed
he
exclaimed
you
you
know
this
man
i
asked
am
hardly
prepared
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
know
him
but
i
chance
to
have
a
memory
for
faces
and
it
happens
that
i
have
met
this
gentleman
on
at
least
one
previous
occasion
perhaps
he
remembers
do
you
the
stranger
seemed
uneasy
as
if
he
found
sidney
tone
and
manner
disconcerting
do
you
are
the
man
in
the
street
i
am
that
individual
and
you
are
the
man
who
came
through
the
window
and
in
a
much
more
comfortable
condition
you
appear
to
be
than
when
first
i
saw
you
sydney
turned
to
me
is
just
possible
miss
lindon
that
i
may
have
a
few
remarks
to
make
to
this
gentleman
which
would
be
better
made
in
private
if
you
do
mind
i
do
mind
i
mind
very
much
what
do
you
suppose
i
sent
for
you
here
for
sydney
smiled
that
absurd
provoking
smile
of
his
as
if
the
occasion
were
not
sufficiently
serious
show
that
you
still
repose
in
me
a
vestige
of
your
confidence
talk
nonsense
this
man
has
told
me
a
most
extraordinary
story
and
i
have
sent
for
you
as
you
may
believe
not
too
willingly
sydney
bowed
order
that
he
may
repeat
it
in
your
presence
and
in
mine
that
so
well
me
to
offer
you
a
chair
this
tale
may
turn
out
to
be
a
trifle
long
to
humour
him
i
accepted
the
chair
he
offered
though
i
should
have
preferred
to
stand
he
seated
himself
on
the
side
of
the
bed
fixing
on
the
stranger
those
keen
quizzical
not
too
merciful
eyes
of
his
sir
we
are
at
your
service
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
favour
us
with
a
second
edition
of
that
pleasant
yarn
you
have
been
spinning
but
let
us
begin
at
the
right
end
what
your
name
name
is
robert
holt
so
then
mr
robert
holt
let
her
go
thus
encouraged
mr
holt
repeated
the
tale
which
he
had
told
me
only
in
more
connected
fashion
than
before
i
fancy
that
sydney
glances
exercised
on
him
a
sort
of
hypnotic
effect
and
this
kept
him
to
the
point
he
scarcely
needed
a
word
of
prompting
from
the
first
syllable
to
the
last
he
told
how
tired
wet
hungry
desperate
despairing
he
had
been
refused
admittance
to
the
casual
ward
that
unfailing
resource
as
one
would
have
supposed
of
those
who
had
abandoned
even
hope
how
he
had
come
upon
an
open
window
in
an
apparently
empty
house
and
thinking
of
nothing
but
shelter
from
the
inclement
night
he
had
clambered
through
it
how
he
had
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
an
extraordinary
being
who
in
his
debilitated
and
nervous
state
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
only
half
human
how
this
dreadful
creature
had
given
utterance
to
wild
sentiments
of
hatred
towards
paul
lessingham
my
paul
how
he
had
taken
advantage
of
holt
enfeebled
state
to
gain
over
him
the
most
complete
horrible
and
indeed
almost
incredible
ascendency
how
he
actually
had
sent
holt
practically
naked
into
the
streets
to
commit
burglary
at
paul
house
and
how
he
holt
had
actually
gone
without
being
able
to
offer
even
a
shadow
of
opposition
how
paul
suddenly
returning
home
had
come
upon
holt
engaged
in
the
very
act
of
committing
burglary
and
how
on
his
hearing
holt
make
a
cabalistic
reference
to
some
mysterious
beetle
the
manhood
had
gone
out
of
him
and
he
had
suffered
the
intruder
to
make
good
his
escape
without
an
effort
to
detain
him
the
story
had
seemed
sufficiently
astonishing
the
first
time
it
seemed
still
more
astonishing
the
second
but
as
i
watched
sydney
listening
what
struck
me
chiefly
was
the
conviction
that
he
had
heard
it
all
before
i
charged
him
with
it
directly
holt
had
finished
is
not
the
first
time
you
have
been
told
this
tale
me
but
it
is
do
you
suppose
i
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
fairy
tales
something
in
his
manner
made
me
feel
sure
he
was
deceiving
me
do
tell
me
a
story
paul
has
told
you
am
not
telling
you
a
story
at
least
on
this
occasion
and
mr
lessingham
has
not
told
me
suppose
we
postpone
these
details
to
a
little
later
and
perhaps
in
the
interim
you
will
permit
me
to
put
a
question
or
two
to
mr
holt
i
let
him
have
his
way
though
i
knew
he
was
concealing
something
from
me
that
he
had
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
mr
holt
strange
tale
than
he
chose
to
confess
and
for
some
cause
his
reticence
annoyed
me
he
looked
at
mr
holt
in
silence
for
a
second
or
two
then
he
said
with
the
quizzical
little
air
of
bland
impertinence
which
is
peculiarly
his
own
presume
mr
holt
you
have
been
entertaining
us
with
a
novelty
in
fables
and
that
we
are
not
expected
to
believe
this
pleasant
little
yarn
of
yours
expect
nothing
but
i
have
told
you
the
truth
and
you
know
it
this
seemed
to
take
sydney
aback
protest
that
like
miss
lindon
you
credit
me
with
a
more
extensive
knowledge
than
i
possess
however
we
will
let
that
i
take
it
that
you
paid
particular
attention
to
this
mysterious
habitant
of
this
mysterious
dwelling
i
saw
that
mr
holt
shuddered
am
not
likely
ever
to
forget
him
in
that
case
you
will
be
able
to
describe
him
to
us
do
so
adequately
would
be
beyond
my
powers
but
i
will
do
my
best
if
the
original
was
more
remarkable
than
the
description
which
he
gave
of
him
then
he
must
have
been
remarkable
indeed
the
impression
conveyed
to
my
mind
was
rather
of
a
monster
than
a
human
being
i
watched
sydney
attentively
as
he
followed
mr
holt
somewhat
lurid
language
and
there
was
something
in
his
demeanour
which
made
me
more
and
more
persuaded
that
he
was
more
behind
the
scenes
in
this
strange
business
than
he
pretended
or
than
the
speaker
suspected
he
put
a
question
which
seemed
uncalled
for
by
anything
which
mr
holt
had
said
are
sure
this
thing
of
beauty
was
a
man
sir
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
not
sure
there
was
a
note
in
sydney
voice
which
suggested
that
he
had
received
precisely
the
answer
which
he
had
expected
you
think
it
was
a
woman
did
think
so
more
than
once
though
i
can
hardly
explain
what
made
me
think
so
there
was
certainly
nothing
womanly
about
the
face
he
paused
as
if
to
reflect
then
added
suppose
it
was
a
question
of
instinct
just
it
occurs
to
me
mr
holt
that
you
are
rather
strong
on
questions
of
instinct
sydney
got
off
the
bed
he
stretched
himself
as
if
fatigued
which
is
a
way
he
has
will
not
do
you
the
injustice
to
hint
that
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
your
charming
and
simple
narrative
on
the
contrary
i
will
demonstrate
my
perfect
credence
by
remarking
that
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
you
will
be
able
to
point
out
to
me
for
my
particular
satisfaction
the
delightful
residence
on
which
the
whole
is
founded
mr
holt
coloured
sydney
tone
could
scarcely
have
been
more
significant
must
remember
sir
that
it
was
a
dark
night
that
i
had
never
been
in
that
neighbourhood
before
and
that
i
was
not
in
a
condition
to
pay
much
attention
to
locality
of
which
is
granted
but
how
far
was
it
from
hammersmith
workhouse
under
half
a
mile
in
that
case
surely
you
can
remember
which
turning
you
took
on
leaving
hammersmith
workhouse
i
suppose
there
are
not
many
turnings
you
could
have
taken
think
i
could
remember
you
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
try
it
is
a
very
far
cry
to
hammersmith
do
you
think
you
are
well
enough
to
drive
there
now
just
you
and
i
together
in
a
cab
should
say
so
i
wished
to
get
up
this
morning
it
is
by
the
doctor
orders
i
have
stayed
in
bed
for
once
in
a
while
the
doctor
orders
shall
be
ignored
i
prescribe
fresh
air
sydney
turned
to
me
mr
holt
wardrobe
seems
rather
to
seek
do
you
think
a
suit
of
one
of
the
men
might
fit
him
if
mr
holt
would
mind
making
shift
for
the
moment
then
by
the
time
you
finished
dressing
mr
holt
i
shall
be
ready
while
they
were
ascertaining
which
suit
of
clothes
would
be
best
adapted
to
his
figure
i
went
with
sydney
to
my
room
so
soon
as
we
were
in
i
let
him
know
that
this
was
not
a
matter
in
which
i
intended
to
be
trifled
with
course
you
understand
sydney
that
i
am
coming
with
you
he
pretended
not
to
know
what
i
meant
with
me
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
but
where
the
house
of
which
mr
holt
has
been
speaking
could
give
me
greater
pleasure
but
might
i
point
out
mr
holt
has
to
find
it
yet
will
come
to
help
you
to
help
him
find
it
sydney
laughed
but
i
could
see
he
did
not
altogether
relish
the
suggestion
in
a
hansom
is
such
a
thing
as
a
cab
or
i
could
order
a
carriage
if
you
like
one
sydney
looked
at
me
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
then
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
presently
he
began
to
talk
nonsense
need
not
say
with
what
a
sensation
of
joy
i
should
anticipate
the
delights
of
a
drive
with
you
even
in
a
cab
but
were
i
in
your
place
i
fancy
that
i
should
allow
holt
and
your
humble
servant
to
go
hunting
out
this
house
of
his
alone
it
may
prove
a
more
tedious
business
than
you
imagine
i
promise
that
after
the
hunt
is
over
i
will
describe
the
proceedings
to
you
with
the
most
literal
accuracy
do
you
think
i
do
know
you
been
deceiving
me
all
the
time
you
i
you
do
you
think
i
quite
an
idiot
dear
marjorie
you
think
i
ca
see
that
you
know
all
about
what
mr
holt
has
been
telling
us
perhaps
more
about
it
than
he
knows
himself
my
word
with
what
an
amount
of
knowledge
you
do
credit
me
i
do
or
discredit
you
rather
if
i
were
to
trust
you
you
would
tell
me
just
as
much
as
you
chose
which
would
be
nothing
coming
with
you
so
there
an
end
do
you
happen
to
know
if
there
are
any
revolvers
in
the
house
whatever
for
i
should
like
to
borrow
one
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
since
you
press
me
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
a
revolver
is
quite
likely
to
be
required
are
trying
to
frighten
me
am
doing
nothing
of
the
kind
only
under
the
circumstances
i
am
bound
to
point
out
to
you
what
it
is
you
may
expect
you
think
that
you
bound
to
point
that
out
do
you
then
now
your
bounden
duty
done
as
for
there
being
any
revolvers
in
the
house
papa
has
a
perfect
arsenal
would
you
like
to
take
them
all
but
i
daresay
i
shall
be
able
to
manage
with
one
unless
you
would
like
one
too
you
may
find
yourself
in
need
of
it
am
obliged
to
you
but
on
this
occasion
i
do
think
trouble
i
run
the
oh
sydney
what
a
hypocrite
you
are
for
your
sake
if
i
seem
to
be
i
tell
you
most
seriously
that
i
earnestly
advise
you
to
allow
mr
holt
and
i
to
manage
this
affair
alone
i
do
mind
going
so
far
as
to
say
that
this
is
a
matter
with
which
in
days
to
come
you
will
wish
that
you
had
not
allowed
yourself
to
be
associated
do
you
mean
by
that
do
you
dare
to
insinuate
anything
against
paul
insinuate
nothing
what
i
mean
i
say
right
out
and
my
dear
marjorie
what
i
actually
do
mean
is
this
that
if
in
spite
of
my
urgent
solicitations
you
will
persist
in
accompanying
us
the
expedition
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
will
be
postponed
is
what
you
do
mean
is
it
then
that
settled
i
rang
the
bell
the
servant
came
a
cab
at
once
and
let
me
know
the
moment
mr
holt
is
ready
the
servant
went
i
turned
to
sydney
you
will
excuse
me
i
will
go
and
put
my
hat
on
you
are
of
course
at
liberty
to
please
yourself
as
to
whether
you
will
or
will
not
go
but
if
you
do
then
i
shall
go
with
mr
holt
alone
i
moved
to
the
door
he
stopped
me
dear
marjorie
why
will
you
persist
in
treating
me
with
such
injustice
believe
me
you
have
no
idea
what
sort
of
adventure
this
is
which
you
are
setting
out
upon
or
you
would
hear
reason
i
assure
you
that
you
are
gratuitously
proposing
to
thrust
yourself
into
imminent
peril
sort
of
peril
why
do
you
beat
about
the
bush
why
do
you
speak
right
out
ca
speak
right
out
there
are
circumstances
which
render
it
practically
impossible
and
that
the
plain
truth
but
the
danger
is
none
the
less
real
on
that
account
i
am
not
jesting
i
am
in
earnest
wo
you
take
my
word
for
it
is
not
a
question
of
taking
your
word
only
it
is
a
question
of
something
else
beside
i
have
not
forgotten
my
adventures
of
last
night
and
mr
holt
story
is
mysterious
enough
in
itself
but
there
is
something
more
mysterious
still
at
the
back
of
it
something
which
you
appear
to
suggest
points
unpleasantly
at
paul
my
duty
is
clear
and
nothing
you
can
say
will
turn
me
from
it
paul
as
you
are
very
well
aware
is
already
with
affairs
of
state
pretty
nearly
borne
down
by
them
or
i
would
take
the
tale
to
him
and
he
would
talk
to
you
after
a
fashion
of
his
own
things
being
as
they
are
i
propose
to
show
you
that
although
i
am
not
yet
paul
wife
i
can
make
his
interests
my
own
as
completely
as
though
i
were
i
can
therefore
only
repeat
that
it
is
for
you
to
decide
what
you
intend
to
do
but
if
you
prefer
to
stay
i
shall
go
with
mr
holt
alone
that
when
the
time
for
regret
comes
as
it
will
come
you
are
not
to
blame
me
for
having
done
what
i
advised
you
not
to
do
dear
mr
atherton
i
will
undertake
to
do
my
utmost
to
guard
your
spotless
reputation
i
should
be
sorry
that
anyone
should
hold
you
responsible
for
anything
i
either
said
or
did
well
your
blood
be
on
your
own
head
blood
your
blood
i
should
be
surprised
if
it
comes
to
blood
before
we
perhaps
you
oblige
me
with
the
loan
of
one
of
that
arsenal
of
revolvers
of
which
you
spoke
i
let
him
have
his
old
revolver
or
rather
i
let
him
have
one
of
papa
new
ones
he
put
it
in
the
hip
pocket
in
his
trousers
and
the
expedition
started
in
a
car
chapter
xxix
the
house
on
the
road
from
the
workhouse
mr
holt
looked
as
if
he
was
in
somebody
else
garments
he
was
so
thin
and
worn
and
wasted
that
the
suit
of
clothes
which
one
of
the
men
had
lent
him
hung
upon
him
as
on
a
scarecrow
i
was
almost
ashamed
of
myself
for
having
incurred
a
share
of
the
responsibility
of
taking
him
out
of
bed
he
seemed
so
weak
and
bloodless
that
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
fainted
on
the
road
i
had
taken
care
that
he
should
eat
as
much
as
he
could
eat
before
we
started
the
suggestion
of
starvation
which
he
had
conveyed
to
one
mind
was
dreadful
and
i
had
brought
a
flask
of
brandy
in
case
of
accidents
but
in
spite
of
everything
i
could
not
conceal
from
myself
that
he
would
be
more
at
home
in
a
than
in
a
jolting
cab
it
was
not
a
cheerful
drive
there
was
in
sydney
manner
towards
me
an
air
of
protection
which
i
instinctively
resented
he
appeared
to
be
regarding
me
as
a
careful
and
anxious
nurse
might
regard
a
and
disobedient
child
conversation
distinctly
languished
since
sydney
seemed
disposed
to
patronise
me
i
was
bent
on
snubbing
him
the
result
was
that
the
majority
of
the
remarks
which
were
uttered
were
addressed
to
mr
holt
the
cab
stopped
after
what
had
appeared
to
me
to
be
an
interminable
journey
i
was
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
its
being
at
an
end
sydney
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
a
short
parley
with
the
driver
ensued
is
workhouse
it
a
large
place
sir
which
part
of
it
might
you
be
wanting
sydney
appealed
to
mr
holt
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
in
his
turn
he
did
not
seem
to
recognise
our
surroundings
at
all
have
come
a
different
way
this
is
not
the
way
i
went
i
went
through
hammersmith
and
to
the
casual
ward
i
do
see
that
here
sydney
spoke
to
the
cabman
where
the
casual
ward
the
other
end
sir
take
us
there
he
took
us
there
then
sydney
appealed
again
to
mr
holt
i
dismiss
the
cabman
or
do
you
feel
equal
to
walking
you
i
feel
quite
equal
to
walking
i
think
the
exercise
will
do
me
good
so
the
cabman
was
dismissed
a
step
which
we
and
i
in
particular
had
subsequent
cause
to
regret
mr
holt
took
his
bearings
he
pointed
to
a
door
which
was
just
in
front
of
us
the
entrance
to
the
casual
ward
and
that
over
it
is
the
window
through
which
the
other
man
threw
a
stone
i
went
to
the
right
back
the
way
i
had
come
we
went
to
the
right
reached
this
corner
we
had
reached
a
corner
mr
holt
looked
about
him
endeavouring
to
recall
the
way
he
had
gone
a
good
many
roads
appeared
to
converge
at
that
point
so
that
he
might
have
wandered
in
either
of
several
directions
presently
he
arrived
at
something
like
a
decision
think
this
is
the
way
i
went
i
am
nearly
sure
it
is
he
led
the
way
with
something
of
an
air
of
dubitation
and
we
followed
the
road
he
had
chosen
seemed
to
lead
to
nothing
and
nowhere
we
had
not
gone
many
yards
from
the
workhouse
gates
before
we
were
confronted
by
something
like
chaos
in
front
and
on
either
side
of
us
were
large
spaces
of
waste
land
at
some
more
or
less
remote
period
attempts
appeared
to
have
been
made
at
there
were
untidy
stacks
of
bricks
in
evidence
here
and
there
enormous
boards
announced
that
desirable
land
was
to
be
let
for
building
purposes
the
road
itself
was
unfinished
there
was
no
pavement
and
we
had
the
bare
uneven
ground
for
sidewalk
it
seemed
so
far
as
i
could
judge
to
lose
itself
in
space
and
to
be
swallowed
up
by
the
wilderness
of
land
which
lay
beyond
in
the
near
distance
there
were
houses
enough
and
to
spare
of
a
kind
but
they
were
in
other
roads
in
the
one
in
which
we
actually
were
on
the
right
at
the
end
there
was
a
row
of
unfurnished
carcases
but
only
two
buildings
which
were
in
anything
like
a
fit
state
for
occupation
one
stood
on
either
side
not
facing
each
other
there
was
a
distance
between
them
of
perhaps
fifty
yards
the
sight
of
them
had
a
more
exciting
effect
on
mr
holt
than
it
had
on
me
he
moved
rapidly
forward
coming
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
the
one
upon
our
left
which
was
the
nearer
of
the
pair
is
the
house
he
exclaimed
he
seemed
almost
exhilarated
i
confess
that
i
was
depressed
a
more
habitation
one
could
hardly
imagine
it
was
one
of
those
dreadful
houses
which
while
they
are
still
new
look
old
it
had
quite
possibly
only
been
built
a
year
or
two
and
yet
owing
to
neglect
or
to
poverty
of
construction
or
to
a
combination
of
the
two
it
was
already
threatening
to
tumble
down
it
was
a
small
place
a
couple
of
storeys
high
and
would
have
been
dear
i
should
think
at
thirty
pounds
a
year
the
windows
had
surely
never
been
washed
since
the
house
was
built
those
on
the
upper
floor
seemed
all
either
cracked
or
broken
the
only
sign
of
occupancy
consisted
in
the
fact
that
a
blind
was
down
behind
the
window
of
the
room
on
the
ground
floor
curtains
there
were
none
a
low
wall
ran
in
front
which
had
apparently
at
one
time
been
surmounted
by
something
in
the
shape
of
an
iron
railing
a
rusty
piece
of
metal
still
remained
on
one
end
but
since
there
was
only
about
a
foot
between
it
and
the
building
which
was
practically
built
upon
the
road
whether
the
wall
was
intended
to
ensure
privacy
or
was
merely
for
ornament
was
not
clear
is
the
house
repeated
mr
holt
showing
more
signs
of
life
than
i
had
hitherto
seen
in
him
sydney
looked
it
up
and
down
it
apparently
appealed
to
his
aesthetic
sense
as
little
as
it
did
to
mine
you
sure
am
certain
seems
empty
seemed
empty
to
me
that
night
that
is
why
i
got
into
it
in
search
of
shelter
is
the
window
which
served
you
as
a
door
one
mr
holt
pointed
to
the
window
on
the
ground
floor
the
one
which
was
screened
by
a
blind
was
no
sign
of
a
blind
when
i
first
saw
it
and
the
sash
was
up
it
was
that
which
caught
my
eye
once
more
sydney
surveyed
the
place
in
comprehensive
fashion
from
roof
to
basement
then
he
scrutinisingly
regarded
mr
holt
are
quite
sure
this
is
the
house
it
might
be
awkward
if
you
proved
mistaken
i
am
going
to
knock
at
the
door
and
if
it
turns
out
that
that
mysterious
acquaintance
of
yours
does
not
and
never
has
lived
here
we
might
find
an
explanation
difficult
am
sure
it
is
the
house
certain
i
know
it
i
feel
it
here
and
here
mr
holt
touched
his
breast
and
his
forehead
his
manner
was
distinctly
odd
he
was
trembling
and
a
fevered
expression
had
come
into
his
eyes
sydney
glanced
at
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
bestowed
his
attention
upon
me
i
ask
if
i
may
rely
upon
your
preserving
your
presence
of
mind
the
mere
question
ruffled
my
plumes
do
you
mean
i
say
i
am
going
to
knock
at
that
door
and
i
am
going
to
get
through
it
somehow
it
is
quite
within
the
range
of
possibility
that
when
i
am
through
there
will
be
some
strange
happenings
as
you
have
heard
from
mr
holt
the
house
is
commonplace
enough
without
you
may
not
find
it
so
commonplace
within
you
may
find
yourself
in
a
position
in
which
it
will
be
in
the
highest
degree
essential
that
you
should
keep
your
wits
about
you
am
not
likely
to
let
them
stray
that
all
do
i
understand
that
you
propose
to
come
in
with
me
course
i
do
what
do
you
suppose
i
come
for
what
nonsense
you
are
talking
hope
that
you
will
still
continue
to
consider
it
nonsense
by
the
time
this
little
adventure
done
that
i
resented
his
impertinence
goes
without
saying
to
be
talked
to
in
such
a
strain
by
sydney
atherton
whom
i
had
kept
in
subjection
ever
since
he
was
in
knickerbockers
was
a
little
trying
but
i
am
forced
to
admit
that
i
was
more
impressed
by
his
manner
or
his
words
or
by
mr
holt
manner
or
something
than
i
should
have
cared
to
own
i
had
not
the
least
notion
what
was
going
to
happen
or
what
horrors
that
dwelling
contained
but
mr
holt
story
had
been
of
the
most
astonishing
sort
my
experiences
of
the
previous
night
were
still
fresh
and
altogether
now
that
i
was
in
such
close
neighbourhood
with
the
unknown
with
a
capital
u
although
it
was
broad
daylight
it
loomed
before
me
in
a
shape
for
which
candidly
i
was
not
prepared
a
more
front
door
i
have
not
seen
it
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
remainder
of
the
establishment
the
paint
was
off
the
woodwork
was
scratched
and
dented
the
knocker
was
red
with
rust
when
sydney
took
it
in
his
hand
i
was
conscious
of
quite
a
little
thrill
as
he
brought
it
down
with
a
sharp
i
half
expected
to
see
the
door
fly
open
and
disclose
some
gruesome
object
glaring
out
at
us
nothing
of
the
kind
took
place
the
door
did
not
budge
nothing
happened
sydney
waited
a
second
or
two
then
knocked
again
another
second
or
two
then
another
knock
there
was
still
no
sign
of
any
notice
being
taken
of
our
presence
sydney
turned
to
mr
holt
as
if
the
place
was
empty
mr
holt
was
in
the
most
singular
condition
of
agitation
it
made
me
uncomfortable
to
look
at
him
do
not
know
you
can
not
tell
there
may
be
someone
there
who
hears
and
pays
no
heed
give
them
another
chance
sydney
brought
down
the
knocker
with
thundering
reverberations
the
din
must
have
been
audible
half
a
mile
away
but
from
within
the
house
there
was
still
no
sign
that
any
heard
sydney
came
down
the
step
try
another
way
i
may
have
better
fortune
at
the
back
he
led
the
way
round
to
the
rear
mr
holt
and
i
following
in
single
file
there
the
place
seemed
in
worse
case
even
than
in
the
front
there
were
two
empty
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
at
the
back
there
was
no
mistake
about
their
being
empty
without
the
slightest
difficulty
we
could
see
right
into
them
one
was
apparently
intended
for
a
kitchen
and
combined
the
other
for
a
there
was
not
a
stick
of
furniture
in
either
nor
the
slightest
sign
of
human
habitation
sydney
commented
on
the
fact
only
is
it
plain
that
no
one
lives
in
these
charming
apartments
but
it
looks
to
me
uncommonly
as
if
no
one
ever
had
lived
in
them
to
my
thinking
mr
holt
agitation
was
increasing
every
moment
for
some
reason
of
his
own
sydney
took
no
notice
of
it
whatever
possibly
because
he
judged
that
to
do
so
would
only
tend
to
make
it
worse
an
odd
change
had
even
taken
place
in
mr
holt
voice
he
spoke
in
a
sort
of
tremulous
falsetto
was
only
the
front
room
which
i
saw
good
then
before
very
long
you
shall
see
that
front
room
again
sydney
rapped
with
his
knuckles
on
the
glass
panels
of
the
back
door
he
tried
the
handle
when
it
refused
to
yield
he
gave
it
a
vigorous
shaking
he
saluted
the
dirty
windows
so
far
as
succeeding
in
attracting
attention
was
concerned
entirely
in
vain
then
he
turned
again
to
mr
holt
half
mockingly
call
you
to
witness
that
i
have
used
every
lawful
means
to
gain
the
favourable
notice
of
your
mysterious
friend
i
must
therefore
beg
to
stand
excused
if
i
try
something
slightly
unlawful
for
a
change
it
is
true
that
you
found
the
window
already
open
but
in
my
case
it
soon
will
be
he
took
a
knife
out
of
his
pocket
and
with
the
open
blade
forced
back
the
catch
as
i
am
told
that
burglars
do
then
he
lifted
the
sash
he
exclaimed
did
i
tell
you
now
my
dear
marjorie
if
i
get
in
first
and
mr
holt
gets
in
after
me
we
shall
be
in
a
position
to
open
the
door
for
you
i
immediately
saw
through
his
design
mr
atherton
you
will
get
in
first
and
i
will
get
in
after
you
through
the
window
before
mr
holt
i
do
intend
to
wait
for
you
to
open
the
door
sydney
raised
his
hands
and
opened
his
eyes
as
if
grieved
at
my
want
of
confidence
but
i
did
not
mean
to
be
left
in
the
lurch
to
wait
their
pleasure
while
on
pretence
of
opening
the
door
they
searched
the
house
so
sydney
climbed
in
first
and
i
second
it
was
not
a
difficult
operation
since
the
was
under
three
feet
from
the
ground
and
mr
holt
last
directly
we
were
in
sydney
put
his
hand
up
to
his
mouth
and
shouted
there
anybody
in
this
house
if
so
will
he
kindly
step
this
way
as
there
is
someone
wishes
to
see
him
his
words
went
echoing
through
the
empty
rooms
in
a
way
which
was
almost
uncanny
i
suddenly
realised
that
if
after
all
there
did
happen
to
be
somebody
in
the
house
and
he
was
at
all
disagreeable
our
presence
on
his
premises
might
prove
rather
difficult
to
explain
however
no
one
answered
while
i
was
waiting
for
sydney
to
make
the
next
move
he
diverted
my
attention
to
mr
holt
holt
what
the
matter
with
you
man
do
play
the
fool
like
that
something
was
the
matter
with
mr
holt
he
was
trembling
all
over
as
if
attacked
by
a
shaking
palsy
every
muscle
in
his
body
seemed
twitching
at
once
a
strained
look
had
come
on
his
face
which
was
not
nice
to
see
he
spoke
as
with
an
effort
all
it
nothing
is
it
nothing
then
perhaps
you
drop
it
where
that
brandy
i
handed
sydney
the
flask
swallow
this
mr
holt
swallowed
the
cupful
of
neat
spirit
which
sydney
offered
without
an
attempt
at
parley
beyond
bringing
some
remnants
of
colour
to
his
ashen
cheeks
it
seemed
to
have
no
effect
on
him
whatever
sydney
eyed
him
with
a
meaning
in
his
glance
which
i
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
to
me
my
lad
do
think
you
can
deceive
me
by
playing
any
of
your
fool
tricks
and
do
delude
yourself
into
supposing
that
i
shall
treat
you
as
anything
but
dangerous
if
you
do
i
got
this
he
showed
the
revolver
of
papa
which
i
had
lent
him
imagine
that
miss
lindon
presence
will
deter
me
from
using
it
why
he
addressed
mr
holt
in
such
a
strain
surpassed
my
comprehension
mr
holt
however
evinced
not
the
faintest
symptoms
of
resentment
he
had
become
on
a
sudden
more
like
an
automaton
than
a
man
sydney
continued
to
gaze
at
him
as
if
he
would
have
liked
his
glance
to
penetrate
to
his
inmost
soul
in
front
of
me
if
you
please
mr
holt
and
lead
the
way
to
this
mysterious
apartment
in
which
you
claim
to
have
had
such
a
remarkable
experience
of
me
he
asked
in
a
whisper
you
bring
a
revolver
i
was
startled
revolver
the
idea
how
absurd
you
are
sydney
said
something
which
was
so
rude
and
so
uncalled
for
that
it
was
worthy
of
papa
in
his
most
violent
moments
sooner
be
absurd
than
a
fool
in
petticoats
i
was
so
angry
that
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
before
i
could
say
it
he
went
on
your
eyes
and
ears
well
open
be
surprised
at
nothing
you
see
or
hear
stick
close
to
me
and
for
goodness
sake
remain
mistress
of
as
many
of
your
senses
as
you
conveniently
can
i
had
not
the
least
idea
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
all
to
me
there
seemed
nothing
to
make
such
a
pother
about
and
yet
i
was
conscious
of
a
fluttering
of
the
heart
as
if
there
soon
might
be
something
i
knew
sydney
sufficiently
well
to
be
aware
that
he
was
one
of
the
last
men
in
the
world
to
make
a
fuss
without
reason
and
that
he
was
as
little
likely
to
suppose
that
there
was
a
reason
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
none
mr
holt
led
the
way
as
sydney
desired
or
rather
commanded
to
the
door
of
the
room
which
was
in
front
of
the
house
the
door
was
closed
sydney
tapped
on
a
panel
all
was
silence
he
tapped
again
in
there
he
demanded
as
there
was
still
no
answer
he
tried
the
handle
the
door
was
locked
first
sign
of
the
presence
of
a
human
being
we
have
had
doors
do
lock
themselves
it
just
possible
that
there
may
have
been
someone
or
something
about
the
place
at
some
time
or
other
after
all
grasping
the
handle
firmly
he
shook
it
with
all
his
might
as
he
had
done
with
the
door
at
the
back
so
flimsily
was
the
place
constructed
that
he
made
even
the
walls
to
tremble
there
if
anyone
is
in
there
if
you
do
open
this
door
i
shall
there
was
no
response
so
be
it
i
going
to
pursue
my
wild
career
of
defiance
of
established
law
and
order
and
gain
admission
in
one
way
if
i
ca
in
another
putting
his
right
shoulder
against
the
door
he
pushed
with
his
whole
force
sydney
is
a
big
man
and
very
strong
and
the
door
was
weak
shortly
the
lock
yielded
before
the
continuous
pressure
and
the
door
flew
open
sydney
whistled
it
begins
to
occur
to
me
mr
holt
that
that
story
of
yours
may
not
have
been
such
pure
romance
as
it
seemed
it
was
plain
enough
that
at
any
rate
this
room
had
been
occupied
and
that
recently
and
if
his
taste
in
furniture
could
be
taken
as
a
test
by
an
eccentric
occupant
to
boot
my
own
first
impression
was
that
there
was
someone
or
something
living
in
it
still
an
uncomfortable
odour
greeted
our
nostrils
which
was
suggestive
of
some
animal
sydney
seemed
to
share
my
thought
pretty
perfume
on
my
word
let
shed
a
little
more
light
on
the
subject
and
see
what
causes
it
marjorie
stop
where
you
are
until
i
tell
you
i
had
noticed
nothing
from
without
peculiar
about
the
appearance
of
the
blind
which
screened
the
window
but
it
must
have
been
made
of
some
unusually
thick
material
for
within
the
room
was
strangely
dark
sydney
entered
with
the
intention
of
drawing
up
the
blind
but
he
had
scarcely
taken
a
couple
of
steps
when
he
stopped
that
it
said
mr
holt
in
a
voice
which
was
so
unlike
his
own
that
it
was
scarcely
recognisable
what
do
you
mean
by
it
beetle
judging
from
the
sound
of
his
voice
sydney
was
all
at
once
in
a
state
of
odd
excitement
is
it
then
if
this
time
i
do
find
out
the
how
and
the
why
and
the
wherefore
of
that
charming
conjuring
trick
i
give
you
leave
to
write
me
down
an
ass
with
a
great
big
a
he
rushed
farther
into
the
room
apparently
his
efforts
to
lighten
it
did
not
meet
with
the
immediate
success
which
he
desired
the
matter
with
this
confounded
blind
there
no
cord
how
do
you
pull
it
up
what
the
in
the
middle
of
his
sentence
sydney
ceased
speaking
suddenly
mr
holt
who
was
standing
by
my
side
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
was
seized
with
such
a
fit
of
trembling
that
fearing
he
was
going
to
fall
i
caught
him
by
the
arm
a
most
extraordinary
look
was
on
his
face
his
eyes
were
distended
to
their
fullest
width
as
if
with
horror
at
what
they
saw
in
front
of
them
great
beads
of
perspiration
were
on
his
forehead
coming
he
screamed
exactly
what
happened
i
do
not
know
but
as
he
spoke
i
heard
proceeding
from
the
room
the
sound
of
the
buzzing
of
wings
instantly
it
recalled
my
experiences
of
the
night
before
as
it
did
so
i
was
conscious
of
a
most
unpleasant
qualm
sydney
swore
a
great
oath
as
if
he
were
beside
himself
with
rage
you
wo
go
up
you
shall
come
down
i
suppose
failing
to
find
a
cord
he
seized
the
blind
from
below
and
dragged
it
down
it
came
roller
and
all
clattering
to
the
floor
the
room
was
all
in
light
i
hurried
in
sydney
was
standing
by
the
window
with
a
look
of
perplexity
upon
his
face
which
under
any
other
circumstances
would
have
been
comical
he
was
holding
papa
revolver
in
his
hand
and
was
glaring
round
and
round
the
room
as
if
wholly
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
it
was
he
did
not
see
what
he
was
looking
for
he
exclaimed
you
hear
anything
course
i
did
it
was
that
which
i
heard
last
night
which
so
frightened
me
was
it
then
by
in
his
excitement
he
must
have
been
completely
oblivious
of
my
presence
for
he
used
the
most
terrible
language
i
find
it
there
be
a
small
discussion
it
ca
have
got
out
of
the
room
i
know
the
creature
here
i
not
only
heard
it
i
felt
it
brush
against
my
holt
come
inside
and
shut
that
door
mr
holt
raised
his
arms
as
if
he
were
exerting
himself
to
make
a
forward
movement
but
he
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
on
which
he
stood
ca
he
cried
why
wo
let
me
wo
let
you
beetle
sydney
moved
till
he
was
close
in
front
of
him
he
surveyed
him
with
eager
eyes
i
was
just
at
his
back
i
heard
him
murmur
possibly
to
me
george
it
just
as
i
thought
the
beggar
hypnotised
then
he
said
aloud
you
see
it
now
you
as
mr
holt
spoke
i
again
heard
quite
close
to
me
that
buzzing
sound
sydney
seemed
to
hear
it
too
it
caused
him
to
swing
round
so
quickly
that
he
all
but
whirled
me
off
my
feet
beg
your
pardon
marjorie
but
this
is
of
the
nature
of
an
unparalleled
experience
did
you
hear
something
then
did
distinctly
it
was
close
to
me
within
an
inch
or
two
of
my
face
we
stared
about
us
then
back
at
each
other
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
seen
sydney
laughed
doubtfully
uncommonly
queer
i
do
want
to
suggest
that
there
are
visions
about
or
i
might
suspect
myself
of
softening
of
the
brain
but
queer
there
a
trick
about
it
somewhere
i
am
convinced
and
no
doubt
it
simple
enough
when
you
know
how
it
done
but
the
difficulty
is
to
find
that
do
you
think
our
friend
over
there
is
acting
looks
to
me
as
if
he
were
does
look
ill
he
also
looks
as
if
he
were
hypnotised
if
he
is
it
must
be
by
suggestion
and
that
what
makes
me
doubtful
because
it
will
be
the
first
plainly
established
case
of
hypnotism
by
suggestion
i
holt
said
sydney
in
my
ear
the
voice
and
that
is
the
manner
of
a
hypnotised
man
but
on
the
other
hand
a
person
under
influence
generally
responds
only
to
the
hypnotist
which
is
another
feature
about
our
peculiar
friend
which
arouses
my
suspicions
then
aloud
stand
there
like
an
idiot
come
inside
again
mr
holt
made
an
apparently
futile
effort
to
do
as
he
was
bid
it
was
painful
to
look
at
him
he
was
like
a
feeble
frightened
tottering
child
who
would
come
on
but
can
not
ca
nonsense
my
man
do
you
think
that
this
is
a
performance
in
a
booth
and
that
i
am
to
be
taken
in
by
all
the
humbug
of
the
professional
mesmerist
do
as
i
tell
you
come
into
the
room
there
was
a
repetition
on
mr
holt
part
of
his
previous
pitiful
struggle
this
time
it
was
longer
sustained
than
before
but
the
result
was
the
same
ca
he
wailed
i
say
you
can
and
shall
if
i
pick
you
up
and
carry
you
perhaps
you
will
not
find
yourself
so
helpless
as
you
wish
me
to
suppose
sydney
moved
forward
to
put
his
threat
into
execution
as
he
did
so
a
strange
alteration
took
place
in
mr
holt
demeanour
chapter
xxx
the
singular
behaviour
of
mr
holt
i
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
sydney
was
between
the
door
and
me
mr
holt
was
in
the
hall
just
outside
the
doorway
in
which
he
so
to
speak
was
framed
as
sydney
advanced
towards
him
he
was
seized
with
a
kind
of
convulsion
he
had
to
lean
against
the
side
of
the
door
to
save
himself
from
falling
sydney
paused
and
watched
the
spasm
went
as
suddenly
as
it
came
mr
holt
became
as
motionless
as
he
had
just
now
been
the
other
way
he
stood
in
an
attitude
of
febrile
expectancy
his
chin
raised
his
head
thrown
back
his
eyes
glancing
upwards
with
the
dreadful
fixed
glare
which
had
come
into
them
ever
since
we
had
entered
the
house
he
looked
to
me
as
if
his
every
faculty
was
strained
in
the
act
of
listening
not
a
muscle
in
his
body
seemed
to
move
he
was
as
rigid
as
a
figure
carved
in
stone
presently
the
rigidity
gave
place
to
what
to
an
onlooker
seemed
causeless
agitation
hear
he
exclaimed
in
the
most
curious
voice
i
had
ever
heard
come
it
was
as
though
he
was
speaking
to
someone
who
was
far
away
turning
he
walked
down
the
passage
to
the
front
door
cried
sydney
are
you
off
to
we
both
of
us
hastened
to
see
he
was
fumbling
with
the
latch
before
we
could
reach
him
the
door
was
open
and
he
was
through
it
sydney
rushing
after
him
caught
him
on
the
step
and
held
him
by
the
arm
the
meaning
of
this
little
caper
where
do
you
think
going
now
mr
holt
did
not
condescend
to
turn
and
look
at
him
he
said
in
the
same
dreamy
faraway
unnatural
tone
of
voice
and
he
kept
his
unwavering
gaze
fixed
on
what
was
apparently
some
distant
object
which
was
visible
only
to
himself
am
going
to
him
he
calls
me
calls
you
lord
of
the
beetle
whether
sydney
released
his
arm
or
not
i
can
not
say
as
he
spoke
he
seemed
to
me
to
slip
away
from
sydney
grasp
passing
through
the
gateway
turning
to
the
right
he
commenced
to
retrace
his
steps
in
the
direction
we
had
come
sydney
stared
after
him
in
unequivocal
amazement
then
he
looked
at
me
this
is
a
pretty
fix
now
what
to
be
done
the
matter
with
him
i
inquired
he
mad
method
in
his
madness
if
he
is
he
in
the
same
condition
in
which
he
was
that
night
i
saw
him
come
out
of
the
apostle
window
sydney
has
a
horrible
habit
of
calling
paul
apostle
i
have
spoken
to
him
about
it
over
and
over
again
but
my
words
have
not
made
much
impression
ought
to
be
followed
he
may
be
sailing
off
to
that
mysterious
friend
of
his
this
but
on
the
other
hand
he
may
and
it
may
be
nothing
but
a
trick
of
our
friend
the
to
get
us
away
from
this
elegant
abode
of
his
he
done
me
twice
already
i
do
want
to
be
done
again
and
i
distinctly
do
not
want
him
to
return
and
find
me
missing
he
quite
capable
of
taking
the
hint
and
removing
himself
into
the
ewigkeit
when
the
clue
to
as
pretty
a
mystery
as
ever
i
came
across
will
have
vanished
can
stay
i
said
alone
he
eyed
me
doubtingly
evidently
not
altogether
relishing
the
proposition
not
you
might
send
the
first
person
you
meet
policeman
cabman
or
whoever
it
is
to
keep
me
company
it
seems
a
pity
now
that
we
dismissed
that
cab
it
does
seem
a
pity
sydney
was
biting
his
lip
that
fellow
how
fast
he
moves
mr
holt
was
already
nearing
the
end
of
the
road
you
think
it
necessary
by
all
means
follow
to
see
where
he
goes
you
are
sure
to
meet
somebody
whom
you
will
be
able
to
send
before
you
have
gone
very
far
suppose
i
you
wo
mind
being
left
alone
should
i
i
not
a
child
mr
holt
reaching
the
corner
turned
it
and
vanished
out
of
sight
sydney
gave
an
exclamation
of
impatience
i
do
make
haste
i
shall
lose
him
i
do
as
you
suggest
dispatch
the
first
individual
i
come
across
to
hold
watch
and
ward
with
you
be
all
right
he
started
off
at
a
run
shouting
to
me
as
he
went
wo
be
five
minutes
before
somebody
comes
i
waved
my
hand
to
him
i
watched
him
till
he
reached
the
end
of
the
road
turning
he
waved
his
hand
to
me
then
he
vanished
as
mr
holt
had
done
and
i
was
alone
chapter
xxxi
the
terror
by
day
my
first
impulse
after
sydney
disappearance
was
to
laugh
why
should
he
display
anxiety
on
my
behalf
merely
because
i
was
to
be
the
sole
occupant
of
an
otherwise
empty
house
for
a
few
minutes
more
or
less
and
in
broad
daylight
too
to
say
the
least
the
anxiety
seemed
unwarranted
i
lingered
at
the
gate
for
a
moment
or
two
wondering
what
was
at
the
bottom
of
mr
holt
singular
proceedings
and
what
sydney
really
proposed
to
gain
by
acting
as
a
spy
upon
his
wanderings
then
i
turned
to
the
house
as
i
did
so
another
problem
suggested
itself
to
my
mind
what
connection
of
the
slightest
importance
could
a
man
in
paul
lessingham
position
have
with
the
eccentric
being
who
had
established
himself
in
such
an
unsatisfactory
mr
story
i
had
only
dimly
understood
it
struck
me
that
it
would
require
a
deal
of
understanding
it
was
more
like
a
farrago
of
nonsense
an
outcome
of
delirium
than
a
plain
statement
of
solid
facts
to
tell
the
truth
sydney
had
taken
it
more
seriously
than
i
expected
he
seemed
to
see
something
in
it
which
i
emphatically
did
not
what
was
double
dutch
to
me
seemed
clear
as
print
to
him
so
far
as
i
could
judge
he
actually
had
the
presumption
to
imagine
that
paul
my
paul
paul
lessingham
the
great
paul
lessingham
was
mixed
up
in
the
very
mysterious
adventures
of
poor
hysterical
mr
holt
in
a
manner
which
was
hardly
to
his
credit
of
course
any
idea
of
the
kind
was
purely
and
simply
balderdash
exactly
what
bee
sydney
had
got
in
his
bonnet
i
could
not
guess
but
i
did
know
paul
only
let
me
find
myself
face
to
face
with
the
fantastic
author
of
mr
holt
weird
tribulations
and
i
a
woman
would
do
my
best
to
show
him
that
whoever
played
pranks
with
paul
lessingham
trifled
with
edged
tools
i
had
returned
to
that
historical
front
room
which
according
to
mr
holt
had
been
the
scene
of
his
most
disastrous
burglarious
entry
whoever
had
furnished
it
had
had
original
notions
of
the
resources
of
modern
upholstery
there
was
not
a
table
in
the
place
no
chair
or
couch
nothing
to
sit
down
upon
except
the
bed
on
the
floor
there
was
a
marvellous
carpet
which
was
apparently
of
eastern
manufacture
it
was
so
thick
and
so
pliant
to
the
tread
that
moving
over
it
was
like
walking
on
turf
it
was
woven
in
gorgeous
colours
and
covered
with
when
i
discovered
what
it
actually
was
covered
with
i
was
conscious
of
a
disagreeable
sense
of
surprise
it
was
covered
with
beetles
all
over
it
with
only
a
few
inches
of
space
between
each
were
representations
of
some
peculiar
kind
of
beetle
it
was
the
same
beetle
over
and
over
and
over
the
artist
had
woven
his
undesirable
subject
into
the
warp
and
woof
of
the
material
with
such
cunning
skill
that
as
one
continued
to
gaze
one
began
to
wonder
if
by
any
possibility
the
creatures
could
be
alive
in
spite
of
the
softness
of
the
texture
and
the
art
of
a
kind
which
had
been
displayed
in
the
workmanship
i
rapidly
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
was
the
most
uncomfortable
carpet
i
had
ever
seen
i
wagged
my
finger
at
the
repeated
portrayals
of
the
to
me
unspeakable
insect
i
had
discovered
that
you
were
there
before
sydney
went
i
think
it
just
possible
that
i
should
have
hesitated
before
i
let
him
go
then
there
came
a
revulsion
of
feeling
i
shook
myself
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
marjorie
lindon
to
even
think
such
nonsense
are
you
all
nerves
and
morbid
imaginings
you
who
have
prided
yourself
on
being
so
a
pretty
sort
you
are
to
do
battle
for
why
they
only
half
involuntarily
i
drew
my
foot
over
one
of
the
creatures
of
course
it
was
nothing
but
imagination
but
i
seemed
to
feel
it
squelch
beneath
my
shoe
it
was
disgusting
i
cried
wo
do
as
sydney
would
phrase
it
am
i
going
to
make
an
idiot
of
myself
i
turned
to
the
window
looking
at
my
watch
more
than
five
minutes
ago
since
sydney
went
that
companion
of
mine
ought
to
be
already
on
the
way
i
go
and
see
if
he
is
coming
i
went
to
the
gate
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
it
was
with
such
a
distinct
sense
of
disappointment
that
i
perceived
this
was
so
that
i
was
in
two
minds
what
to
do
to
remain
where
i
was
looking
with
gaping
eyes
for
the
policeman
or
the
cabman
or
whoever
it
was
sydney
was
dispatching
to
act
as
my
temporary
associate
was
tantamount
to
acknowledging
myself
a
simpleton
while
i
was
conscious
of
a
most
unmistakable
reluctance
to
return
within
the
house
common
sense
or
what
i
took
for
common
sense
however
triumphed
and
after
loitering
for
another
five
minutes
i
did
go
in
again
this
time
ignoring
to
the
best
of
my
ability
the
beetles
on
the
floor
i
proceeded
to
expend
my
curiosity
and
occupy
my
thoughts
in
an
examination
of
the
bed
it
only
needed
a
very
cursory
examination
however
to
show
that
the
seeming
bed
was
in
reality
none
at
all
or
if
it
was
a
bed
after
the
manner
of
the
easterns
it
certainly
was
not
after
the
fashion
of
the
britons
there
was
no
framework
nothing
to
represent
the
bedstead
it
was
simply
a
heap
of
rugs
piled
apparently
indiscriminately
upon
the
floor
a
huge
mass
of
them
there
seemed
to
be
of
all
sorts
and
shapes
and
sizes
and
materials
too
the
top
one
was
of
white
silk
in
quality
exquisite
it
was
of
huge
size
yet
with
a
little
compression
one
might
almost
have
passed
it
through
the
proverbial
wedding
ring
so
far
as
space
admitted
i
spread
it
out
in
front
of
me
in
the
middle
was
a
picture
whether
it
was
embroidered
on
the
substance
or
woven
in
it
i
could
not
quite
make
out
nor
at
first
could
i
gather
what
it
was
the
artist
had
intended
to
depict
there
was
a
brilliancy
about
it
which
was
rather
dazzling
by
degrees
i
realised
that
the
lurid
hues
were
meant
for
flames
and
when
one
had
got
so
far
one
perceived
that
they
were
by
no
means
badly
imitated
either
then
the
meaning
of
the
thing
dawned
on
me
it
was
a
representation
of
a
human
sacrifice
in
its
way
as
ghastly
a
piece
of
realism
as
one
could
see
on
the
right
was
the
majestic
seated
figure
of
a
goddess
her
hands
were
crossed
upon
her
knees
and
she
was
naked
from
her
waist
upwards
i
fancied
it
was
meant
for
isis
on
her
brow
was
perched
a
beetle
that
ubiquitous
beetle
forming
a
bright
spot
of
colour
against
her
coppery
skin
it
was
an
exact
reproduction
of
the
creatures
which
were
imaged
on
the
carpet
in
front
of
the
idol
was
an
enormous
fiery
furnace
in
the
very
heart
of
the
flames
was
an
altar
on
the
altar
was
a
naked
white
woman
being
burned
alive
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
her
being
alive
for
she
was
secured
by
chains
in
such
a
fashion
that
she
was
permitted
a
certain
amount
of
freedom
of
which
she
was
availing
herself
to
contort
and
twist
her
body
into
shapes
which
were
horribly
suggestive
of
the
agony
which
she
was
enduring
the
artist
indeed
seemed
to
have
exhausted
his
powers
in
his
efforts
to
convey
a
vivid
impression
of
the
pains
which
were
tormenting
her
pretty
picture
on
my
word
a
pleasant
taste
in
art
the
garnitures
of
this
establishment
suggest
the
person
who
likes
to
live
with
this
kind
of
thing
especially
as
a
covering
to
his
bed
must
have
his
own
notions
as
to
what
constitute
agreeable
surroundings
as
i
continued
staring
at
the
thing
all
at
once
it
seemed
as
if
the
woman
on
the
altar
moved
it
was
preposterous
but
she
appeared
to
gather
her
limbs
together
and
turn
half
over
can
be
the
matter
with
me
am
i
going
mad
she
ca
be
moving
if
she
was
then
certainly
something
was
she
was
lifted
right
into
the
air
an
idea
occurred
to
me
i
snatched
the
rug
aside
the
mystery
was
explained
a
thin
yellow
wrinkled
hand
was
protruding
from
amidst
the
heap
of
rugs
it
was
its
action
which
had
caused
the
seeming
movement
of
the
figure
on
the
altar
i
stared
confounded
the
hand
was
followed
by
an
arm
the
arm
by
a
shoulder
the
shoulder
by
a
head
and
the
most
awful
hideous
face
i
had
ever
pictured
even
in
my
most
dreadful
dreams
a
pair
of
baleful
eyes
were
glaring
up
at
mine
i
understood
the
position
in
a
flash
of
startled
amazement
sydney
in
following
mr
holt
had
started
on
a
wild
goose
chase
after
all
i
was
alone
with
the
occupant
of
that
mysterious
house
the
chief
actor
in
mr
holt
astounding
tale
he
had
been
hidden
in
the
heap
of
rugs
all
the
while
book
iv
in
pursuit
the
conclusion
of
the
matter
is
extracted
from
the
of
the
hon
augustus
champnell
confidential
agent
chapter
xxxii
a
new
client
on
the
afternoon
of
friday
june
i
was
entering
in
my
some
memoranda
having
reference
to
the
very
curious
matter
of
the
duchess
of
datchet
it
was
about
two
andrews
came
in
and
laid
a
card
upon
my
desk
on
it
was
inscribed
paul
lessingham
mr
lessingham
in
andrews
showed
him
in
i
was
of
course
familiar
with
mr
appearance
but
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
had
with
him
any
personal
communication
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
are
mr
champnell
am
believe
that
i
have
not
had
the
honour
of
meeting
you
before
mr
champnell
but
with
your
father
the
earl
of
glenlivet
i
have
the
pleasure
of
some
acquaintance
i
bowed
he
looked
at
me
fixedly
as
if
he
were
trying
to
make
out
what
sort
of
man
i
was
are
very
young
mr
champnell
have
been
told
that
an
eminent
offender
in
that
respect
once
asserted
that
youth
is
not
of
necessity
a
crime
you
have
chosen
a
singular
profession
one
in
which
one
hardly
looks
for
juvenility
yourself
mr
lessingham
are
not
old
in
a
statesman
one
expects
grey
i
trust
that
i
am
sufficiently
ancient
to
be
able
to
do
you
service
he
smiled
think
it
possible
i
have
heard
of
you
more
than
once
mr
champnell
always
to
your
advantage
my
friend
sir
john
seymour
was
telling
me
only
the
other
day
that
you
have
recently
conducted
for
him
some
business
of
a
very
delicate
nature
with
much
skill
and
tact
and
he
warmly
advised
me
if
ever
i
found
myself
in
a
predicament
to
come
to
you
i
find
myself
in
a
predicament
now
again
i
bowed
predicament
i
fancy
of
an
altogether
unparalleled
sort
i
take
it
that
anything
i
may
say
to
you
will
be
as
though
it
were
said
to
a
father
confessor
may
rest
assured
of
that
then
to
make
the
matter
clear
to
you
i
must
begin
by
telling
you
a
story
if
i
may
trespass
on
your
patience
to
that
extent
i
will
endeavour
not
to
be
more
verbose
than
the
occasion
requires
i
offered
him
a
chair
placing
it
in
such
a
position
that
the
light
from
the
window
would
have
shone
full
upon
his
face
with
the
calmest
possible
air
as
if
unconscious
of
my
design
he
carried
the
chair
to
the
other
side
of
my
desk
twisting
it
right
round
before
he
sat
on
it
so
that
now
the
light
was
at
his
back
and
on
my
face
crossing
his
legs
clasping
his
hands
about
his
knee
he
sat
in
silence
for
some
moments
as
if
turning
something
over
in
his
mind
he
glanced
round
the
room
suppose
mr
champnell
that
some
singular
tales
have
been
told
in
here
very
singular
tales
indeed
i
am
never
appalled
by
singularity
it
is
my
normal
atmosphere
yet
i
should
be
disposed
to
wager
that
you
have
never
listened
to
so
strange
a
story
as
that
which
i
am
about
to
tell
you
now
so
astonishing
indeed
is
the
chapter
in
my
life
which
i
am
about
to
open
out
to
you
that
i
have
more
than
once
had
to
take
myself
to
task
and
fit
the
incidents
together
with
mathematical
accuracy
in
order
to
assure
myself
of
its
perfect
truth
he
paused
there
was
about
his
demeanour
that
suggestion
of
reluctance
which
i
not
uncommonly
discover
in
individuals
who
are
about
to
take
the
skeletons
from
their
cupboards
and
parade
them
before
my
eyes
his
next
remark
seemed
to
point
to
the
fact
that
he
perceived
what
was
passing
through
my
thoughts
position
is
not
rendered
easier
by
the
circumstance
that
i
am
not
of
a
communicative
nature
i
am
not
in
sympathy
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
which
craves
for
personal
advertisement
i
hold
that
the
private
life
even
of
a
public
man
should
be
held
inviolate
i
resent
with
peculiar
bitterness
the
attempts
of
prying
eyes
to
peer
into
matters
which
as
it
seems
to
me
concern
myself
alone
you
must
therefore
bear
with
me
mr
champnell
if
i
seem
awkward
in
disclosing
to
you
certain
incidents
in
my
career
which
i
had
hoped
would
continue
locked
in
the
secret
depository
of
my
own
bosom
at
any
rate
till
i
was
carried
to
the
grave
i
am
sure
you
will
suffer
me
to
stand
excused
if
i
frankly
admit
that
it
is
only
an
irresistible
chain
of
incidents
which
has
constrained
me
to
make
of
you
a
confidant
experience
tells
me
mr
lessingham
that
no
one
ever
does
come
to
me
until
they
are
compelled
in
that
respect
i
am
regarded
as
something
worse
even
than
a
medical
man
a
wintry
smile
flitted
across
his
features
it
was
clear
that
he
regarded
me
as
a
good
deal
worse
than
a
medical
man
presently
he
began
to
tell
me
one
of
the
most
remarkable
tales
which
even
i
had
heard
as
he
proceeded
i
understood
how
strong
and
how
natural
had
been
his
desire
for
reticence
on
the
mere
score
of
credibility
he
must
have
greatly
preferred
to
have
kept
his
own
counsel
for
my
part
i
own
unreservedly
that
i
should
have
deemed
the
tale
incredible
had
it
been
told
me
by
tom
dick
or
harry
instead
of
by
paul
lessingham
chapter
xxxiii
what
came
of
looking
through
a
lattice
he
began
in
accents
which
halted
not
a
little
by
degrees
his
voice
grew
firmer
words
came
from
him
with
greater
fluency
am
not
yet
forty
so
when
i
tell
you
that
twenty
years
ago
i
was
a
mere
youth
i
am
stating
what
is
a
sufficiently
obvious
truth
it
is
twenty
years
ago
since
the
events
of
which
i
am
going
to
speak
transpired
lost
both
my
parents
when
i
was
quite
a
lad
and
by
their
death
i
was
left
in
a
position
in
which
i
was
to
an
unusual
extent
in
one
so
young
my
own
master
i
was
ever
of
a
rambling
turn
of
mind
and
when
at
the
mature
age
of
eighteen
i
left
school
i
decided
that
i
should
learn
more
from
travel
than
from
sojourn
at
a
university
so
since
there
was
no
one
to
say
me
nay
instead
of
going
either
to
oxford
or
cambridge
i
went
abroad
after
a
few
months
i
found
myself
in
egypt
i
was
down
with
fever
at
shepheard
hotel
in
cairo
i
had
caught
it
by
drinking
polluted
water
during
an
excursion
with
some
bedouins
to
palmyra
the
fever
had
left
me
i
went
out
one
night
into
the
town
in
search
of
amusement
i
went
unaccompanied
into
the
native
quarter
not
a
wise
thing
to
do
especially
at
night
but
at
eighteen
one
is
not
always
wise
and
i
was
weary
of
the
monotony
of
the
and
eager
for
something
which
had
in
it
a
spice
of
adventure
i
found
myself
in
a
street
which
i
have
reason
to
believe
is
no
longer
existing
it
had
a
french
name
and
was
called
the
rue
de
rabagas
i
saw
the
name
on
the
corner
as
i
turned
into
it
and
it
has
left
an
impress
on
the
tablets
of
my
memory
which
is
never
likely
to
be
obliterated
was
a
narrow
street
and
of
course
a
dirty
one
and
apparently
at
the
moment
of
my
appearance
deserted
i
had
gone
perhaps
down
its
tortuous
length
blundering
more
than
once
into
the
kennel
wondering
what
fantastic
whim
had
brought
me
into
such
unsavoury
quarters
and
what
would
happen
to
me
if
as
seemed
extremely
possible
i
lost
my
way
on
a
sudden
my
ears
were
saluted
by
sounds
which
proceeded
from
a
house
which
i
was
passing
sounds
of
music
and
of
singing
paused
i
stood
awhile
to
listen
was
an
open
window
on
my
right
which
was
screened
by
latticed
blinds
from
the
room
which
was
behind
these
blinds
the
sounds
were
coming
someone
was
singing
accompanied
by
an
instrument
resembling
a
guitar
singing
uncommonly
well
mr
lessingham
stopped
a
stream
of
recollection
seemed
to
come
flooding
over
him
a
dreamy
look
came
into
his
eyes
remember
it
all
as
clearly
as
if
it
were
yesterday
how
it
all
comes
back
the
dirty
street
the
evil
smells
the
imperfect
light
the
girl
voice
filling
all
at
once
the
air
it
was
a
girl
voice
full
and
round
and
sweet
an
organ
seldom
met
with
especially
in
such
a
place
as
that
she
sang
a
little
chansonnette
which
just
then
half
europe
was
humming
it
occurred
in
an
opera
which
they
were
acting
at
one
of
the
boulevard
theatres
la
voyageuse
the
effect
coming
so
unexpectedly
was
startling
i
stood
and
heard
her
to
an
end
by
i
know
not
what
impulse
of
curiosity
when
the
song
was
finished
i
moved
one
of
the
lattice
blinds
a
little
aside
so
as
to
enable
me
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
singer
i
found
myself
looking
into
what
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
cafe
one
of
those
places
which
are
found
all
over
the
continent
in
which
women
sing
in
order
to
attract
custom
there
was
a
low
platform
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
on
it
were
seated
three
women
one
of
them
had
evidently
just
been
accompanying
her
own
song
she
still
had
an
instrument
of
music
in
her
hands
and
was
striking
a
few
idle
notes
the
other
two
had
been
acting
as
audience
they
were
attired
in
the
fantastic
apparel
which
the
women
who
are
found
in
such
places
generally
wear
an
old
woman
was
sitting
knitting
in
a
corner
whom
i
took
to
be
the
inevitable
patronne
with
the
exception
of
these
four
the
place
was
empty
must
have
heard
me
touch
the
lattice
or
seen
it
moving
for
no
sooner
did
i
glance
within
than
the
three
pairs
of
eyes
on
the
platform
were
raised
and
fixed
on
mine
the
old
woman
in
the
corner
alone
showed
no
consciousness
of
my
neighbourhood
we
eyed
one
another
in
silence
for
a
second
or
two
then
the
girl
with
the
harp
the
instrument
she
was
manipulating
proved
to
be
fashioned
more
like
a
harp
than
a
guitar
called
out
to
me
entrez
monsieur
soye
le
bienvenu
was
a
little
tired
rather
curious
as
to
whereabouts
i
was
the
place
struck
me
even
at
that
first
momentary
glimpse
as
hardly
in
the
ordinary
line
of
that
kind
of
thing
and
not
unwilling
to
listen
to
a
repetition
of
the
former
song
or
to
another
sung
by
the
same
singer
on
condition
i
replied
that
you
sing
me
another
song
ah
monsieur
with
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
i
will
sing
you
twenty
was
almost
if
not
quite
as
good
as
her
word
she
entertained
me
with
song
after
song
i
may
safely
say
that
i
have
seldom
if
ever
heard
melody
more
enchanting
all
languages
seemed
to
be
the
same
to
her
she
sang
in
french
and
italian
german
and
english
in
tongues
with
which
i
was
unfamiliar
it
was
in
these
eastern
harmonies
that
she
was
most
successful
they
were
indescribably
weird
and
thrilling
and
she
delivered
them
with
a
verve
and
sweetness
which
was
amazing
i
sat
at
one
of
the
little
tables
with
which
the
room
was
dotted
listening
entranced
passed
more
rapidly
than
i
supposed
while
she
sang
i
sipped
the
liquor
with
which
the
old
woman
had
supplied
me
so
enthralled
was
i
by
the
display
of
the
girl
astonishing
gifts
that
i
did
not
notice
what
it
was
i
was
drinking
looking
back
i
can
only
surmise
that
it
was
some
poisonous
concoction
of
the
creature
own
that
one
small
glass
had
on
me
the
strangest
effect
i
was
still
weak
from
the
fever
which
i
had
only
just
succeeded
in
shaking
off
and
that
no
doubt
had
something
to
do
with
the
result
but
as
i
continued
to
sit
i
was
conscious
that
i
was
sinking
into
a
lethargic
condition
against
which
i
was
incapable
of
struggling
a
while
the
original
performer
ceased
her
efforts
and
her
companions
taking
her
place
she
came
and
joined
me
at
the
little
table
looking
at
my
watch
i
was
surprised
to
perceive
the
lateness
of
the
hour
i
rose
to
leave
she
caught
me
by
the
wrist
do
not
go
she
said
she
spoke
english
of
a
sort
and
with
the
queerest
accent
all
is
well
with
you
rest
awhile
will
smile
i
should
smile
perhaps
were
i
the
listener
instead
of
you
but
it
is
the
simple
truth
that
her
touch
had
on
me
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
magnetic
influence
as
her
fingers
closed
upon
my
wrist
i
felt
as
powerless
in
her
grasp
as
if
she
held
me
with
bands
of
steel
what
seemed
an
invitation
was
virtually
a
command
i
had
to
stay
whether
i
would
or
would
she
called
for
more
liquor
and
at
what
again
was
really
her
command
i
drank
of
it
i
do
not
think
that
after
she
touched
my
wrist
i
uttered
a
word
she
did
all
the
talking
and
while
she
talked
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
my
face
those
eyes
of
hers
they
were
a
devil
i
can
positively
affirm
that
they
had
on
me
a
diabolical
effect
they
robbed
me
of
my
consciousness
of
my
power
of
volition
of
my
capacity
to
think
they
made
me
as
wax
in
her
hands
my
last
recollection
of
that
fatal
night
is
of
her
sitting
in
front
of
me
bending
over
the
table
stroking
my
wrist
with
her
extended
fingers
staring
at
me
with
her
awful
eyes
after
that
a
curtain
seems
to
descend
there
comes
a
period
of
oblivion
mr
lessingham
ceased
his
manner
was
calm
and
enough
but
in
spite
of
that
i
could
see
that
the
mere
recollection
of
the
things
which
he
told
me
moved
his
nature
to
its
foundations
there
was
eloquence
in
the
drawn
lines
about
his
mouth
and
in
the
strained
expression
of
his
eyes
so
far
his
tale
was
sufficiently
commonplace
places
such
as
the
one
which
he
described
abound
in
the
cairo
of
and
many
are
the
englishmen
who
have
entered
them
to
their
exceeding
bitter
cost
with
that
keen
intuition
which
has
done
him
yeoman
service
in
the
political
arena
mr
lessingham
at
once
perceived
the
direction
my
thoughts
were
taking
have
heard
this
tale
before
no
doubt
and
often
the
traps
are
many
and
the
fools
and
the
unwary
are
not
a
few
the
singularity
of
my
experience
is
still
to
come
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
seem
to
stumble
in
the
telling
i
am
anxious
to
present
my
case
as
baldly
and
with
as
little
appearance
of
exaggeration
as
possible
i
say
with
as
little
appearance
for
some
appearance
of
exaggeration
i
fear
is
unavoidable
my
case
is
so
unique
and
so
out
of
the
common
run
of
our
experience
that
the
plainest
possible
statement
must
smack
of
the
sensational
i
fancy
you
have
guessed
when
understanding
returned
to
me
i
found
myself
in
an
apartment
with
which
i
was
unfamiliar
i
was
lying
undressed
on
a
heap
of
rugs
in
a
corner
of
a
room
which
was
furnished
in
a
fashion
which
when
i
grasped
the
details
filled
me
with
amazement
by
my
side
knelt
the
woman
of
the
songs
leaning
over
she
wooed
my
mouth
with
kisses
i
can
not
describe
to
you
the
sense
of
horror
and
of
loathing
with
which
the
contact
of
her
lips
oppressed
me
there
was
about
her
something
so
unnatural
so
inhuman
that
i
believe
even
then
i
could
have
destroyed
her
with
as
little
sense
of
moral
turpitude
as
if
she
had
been
some
noxious
insect
where
am
i
i
exclaimed
you
are
with
the
children
of
isis
she
replied
what
she
meant
i
did
not
know
and
do
not
to
this
hour
you
are
in
the
hands
of
the
great
goddess
of
the
mother
of
men
how
did
i
come
here
by
the
loving
kindness
of
the
great
mother
do
not
of
course
pretend
to
give
you
the
exact
text
of
her
words
but
they
were
to
that
effect
raising
myself
on
the
heap
of
rugs
i
gazed
about
me
and
was
astounded
at
what
i
saw
place
in
which
i
was
though
the
reverse
of
lofty
was
of
considerable
size
i
could
not
conceive
whereabouts
it
could
be
the
walls
and
roof
were
of
bare
stone
as
though
the
whole
had
been
hewed
out
of
the
solid
rock
it
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
temple
and
was
redolent
with
the
most
extraordinary
odour
an
altar
stood
about
the
centre
fashioned
out
of
a
single
block
of
stone
on
it
a
fire
burned
with
a
faint
blue
flame
the
fumes
which
rose
from
it
were
no
doubt
chiefly
responsible
for
the
prevailing
perfumes
behind
it
was
a
huge
bronze
figure
more
than
life
size
it
was
in
a
sitting
posture
and
represented
a
woman
although
it
resembled
no
portrayal
of
her
i
have
seen
either
before
or
since
i
came
afterwards
to
understand
that
it
was
meant
for
isis
on
the
idol
brow
was
poised
a
beetle
that
the
creature
was
alive
seemed
clear
for
as
i
looked
at
it
it
opened
and
shut
its
wings
the
one
on
the
forehead
of
the
goddess
was
the
only
live
beetle
which
the
place
contained
it
was
not
the
only
representation
it
was
modelled
in
the
solid
stone
of
the
roof
and
depicted
in
flaming
colours
on
hangings
which
here
and
there
were
hung
against
the
walls
wherever
the
eye
turned
it
rested
on
a
scarab
the
effect
was
bewildering
it
was
as
though
one
saw
things
through
the
distorted
glamour
of
a
nightmare
i
asked
myself
if
i
were
not
still
dreaming
if
my
appearance
of
consciousness
were
not
after
all
a
mere
delusion
if
i
had
really
regained
my
senses
here
mr
champnell
i
wish
to
point
out
and
to
emphasise
the
fact
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
positively
affirm
what
portion
of
my
adventures
in
that
extraordinary
and
horrible
place
was
actuality
and
what
the
product
of
a
feverish
imagination
had
i
been
persuaded
that
all
i
thought
i
saw
i
really
did
see
i
should
have
opened
my
lips
long
ago
let
the
consequences
to
myself
have
been
what
they
might
but
there
is
the
crux
the
happenings
were
of
such
an
incredible
character
and
my
condition
was
such
an
abnormal
one
i
was
never
really
myself
from
the
first
moment
to
the
last
that
i
have
hesitated
and
still
do
hesitate
to
assert
where
precisely
fiction
ended
and
fact
began
some
misty
notion
of
testing
my
actual
condition
i
endeavoured
to
get
off
the
heap
of
rugs
on
which
i
reclined
as
i
did
so
the
woman
at
my
side
laid
her
hand
against
my
chest
lightly
but
had
her
gentle
pressure
been
the
equivalent
of
a
ton
of
iron
it
could
not
have
been
more
effectual
i
collapsed
sank
back
upon
the
rugs
and
lay
there
panting
for
breath
wondering
if
i
had
crossed
the
border
line
which
divides
madness
from
sanity
let
me
get
up
let
me
go
i
gasped
nay
she
murmured
stay
with
me
yet
awhile
o
my
beloved
again
she
kissed
me
once
more
mr
lessingham
paused
an
involuntary
shudder
went
all
over
him
in
spite
of
the
evidently
great
effort
which
he
was
making
to
retain
his
his
features
were
contorted
by
an
anguished
spasm
for
some
seconds
he
seemed
at
a
loss
to
find
words
to
enable
him
to
continue
when
he
did
go
on
his
voice
was
harsh
and
strained
am
altogether
incapable
of
even
hinting
to
you
the
nauseous
nature
of
that
woman
kisses
they
filled
me
with
an
indescribable
repulsion
i
look
back
at
them
with
a
feeling
of
physical
mental
and
moral
horror
across
an
interval
of
twenty
years
the
most
dreadful
part
of
it
was
that
i
was
wholly
incapable
of
offering
even
the
faintest
resistance
to
her
caresses
i
lay
there
like
a
log
she
did
with
me
as
she
would
and
in
dumb
agony
i
endured
he
took
his
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
although
the
day
was
cool
with
it
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
dwell
in
detail
on
what
occurred
during
my
involuntary
sojourn
in
that
fearful
place
is
beyond
my
power
i
can
not
even
venture
to
attempt
it
the
attempt
were
it
made
would
be
futile
and
to
me
painful
beyond
measure
i
seem
to
have
seen
all
that
happened
as
in
a
glass
darkly
with
about
it
all
an
element
of
unreality
as
i
have
already
remarked
the
things
which
revealed
themselves
dimly
to
my
perception
seemed
too
bizarre
too
hideous
to
be
true
was
only
afterwards
when
i
was
in
a
position
to
compare
dates
that
i
was
enabled
to
determine
what
had
been
the
length
of
my
imprisonment
it
appears
that
i
was
in
that
horrible
den
more
than
two
months
two
unspeakable
months
and
the
whole
time
there
were
comings
and
goings
a
phantasmagoric
array
of
eerie
figures
continually
passed
to
and
fro
before
my
hazy
eyes
what
i
judge
to
have
been
religious
services
took
place
in
which
the
altar
the
bronze
image
and
the
beetle
on
its
brow
figure
largely
not
only
were
they
conducted
with
a
bewildering
confusion
of
mysterious
rites
but
if
my
memory
is
in
the
least
degree
trustworthy
they
were
orgies
of
nameless
horrors
i
seem
to
have
seen
things
take
place
at
them
at
the
mere
thought
of
which
the
brain
reels
and
trembles
it
is
in
connection
with
the
cult
of
the
obscene
deity
to
whom
these
wretched
creatures
paid
their
scandalous
vows
that
my
most
awful
memories
seem
to
have
been
associated
it
may
have
been
i
hope
it
was
a
mirage
born
of
my
half
delirious
state
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
offered
human
sacrifices
when
mr
lessingham
said
this
i
pricked
up
my
ears
for
reasons
of
my
own
which
will
immediately
transpire
i
had
been
wondering
if
he
would
make
any
reference
to
a
human
sacrifice
he
noted
my
display
of
interest
but
misapprehended
the
cause
see
you
start
i
do
not
wonder
but
i
repeat
that
unless
i
was
the
victim
of
some
extraordinary
species
of
double
sight
in
which
case
the
whole
business
would
resolve
itself
into
the
fabric
of
a
dream
and
i
should
indeed
thank
god
i
saw
on
more
than
one
occasion
a
human
sacrifice
offered
on
that
stone
altar
presumably
to
the
grim
image
which
looked
down
on
it
and
unless
i
err
in
each
case
the
sacrificial
object
was
a
woman
stripped
to
the
skin
as
white
as
you
or
i
and
before
they
burned
her
they
subjected
her
to
every
variety
of
outrage
of
which
even
the
minds
of
demons
could
conceive
more
than
once
since
then
i
have
seemed
to
hear
the
shrieks
of
the
victims
ringing
through
the
air
mingled
with
the
triumphant
cries
of
her
frenzied
murderers
and
the
music
of
their
harps
was
the
cumulative
horrors
of
such
a
scene
which
gave
me
the
strength
or
the
courage
or
the
madness
i
know
not
which
it
was
to
burst
the
bonds
which
bound
me
and
which
even
in
the
bursting
made
of
me
even
to
this
hour
a
haunted
man
had
been
a
sacrifice
unless
as
i
have
repeatedly
observed
the
whole
was
nothing
but
a
dream
a
woman
a
young
and
lovely
englishwoman
if
i
could
believe
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
had
been
outraged
and
burnt
alive
while
i
lay
there
helpless
looking
on
the
business
was
concluded
the
ashes
of
the
victim
had
been
consumed
by
the
participants
the
worshippers
had
departed
i
was
left
alone
with
the
woman
of
the
songs
who
apparently
acted
as
the
guardian
of
that
worse
than
slaughterhouse
she
was
as
usual
after
such
an
orgie
rather
a
devil
than
a
human
being
drunk
with
an
insensate
frenzy
delirious
with
inhuman
longings
as
she
approached
to
offer
to
me
her
loathed
caresses
i
was
on
a
sudden
conscious
of
something
which
i
had
not
felt
before
when
in
her
company
it
was
as
though
something
had
slipped
away
from
me
some
weight
which
had
oppressed
me
some
bond
by
which
i
had
been
bound
i
was
aroused
all
at
once
to
a
sense
of
freedom
to
a
knowledge
that
the
blood
which
coursed
through
my
veins
was
after
all
my
own
that
i
was
master
of
my
own
honour
can
only
suppose
that
through
all
those
weeks
she
had
kept
me
there
in
a
state
of
mesmeric
stupor
that
taking
advantage
of
the
weakness
which
the
fever
had
left
behind
by
the
exercise
of
her
diabolical
arts
she
had
not
allowed
me
to
pass
out
of
a
condition
of
hypnotic
trance
now
for
some
reason
the
cord
was
loosed
possibly
her
absorption
in
her
religious
duties
had
caused
her
to
forget
to
tighten
it
anyhow
as
she
approached
me
she
approached
a
man
and
one
who
for
the
first
time
for
many
a
day
was
his
own
man
she
herself
seemed
wholly
unconscious
of
anything
of
the
kind
as
she
drew
nearer
to
me
and
nearer
she
appeared
to
be
entirely
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
i
was
anything
but
the
fibreless
emasculated
creature
which
up
to
that
moment
she
had
made
of
me
she
knew
it
when
she
touched
me
when
she
stooped
to
press
her
lips
to
mine
at
that
instant
the
accumulating
rage
which
had
been
smouldering
in
my
breast
through
all
those
leaden
torturing
hours
sprang
into
flame
leaping
off
my
couch
of
rugs
i
flung
my
hands
about
her
throat
and
then
she
knew
i
was
awake
then
she
strove
to
tighten
the
cord
which
she
had
suffered
to
become
unduly
loose
her
baleful
eyes
were
fixed
on
mine
i
knew
that
she
was
putting
out
her
utmost
force
to
trick
me
of
my
manhood
but
i
fought
with
her
like
one
possessed
and
i
conquered
in
a
fashion
i
compressed
her
throat
with
my
two
hands
as
with
an
iron
vice
i
knew
that
i
was
struggling
for
more
than
life
that
the
odds
were
all
against
me
that
i
was
staking
my
all
upon
the
casting
of
a
die
i
stuck
at
nothing
which
could
make
me
victor
and
tighter
my
pressure
grew
i
did
not
stay
to
think
if
i
was
killing
her
till
on
a
sudden
mr
lessingham
stopped
he
stared
with
fixed
glassy
eyes
as
if
the
whole
was
being
in
front
of
him
his
voice
faltered
i
thought
he
would
break
down
but
with
an
effort
he
continued
a
sudden
i
felt
her
slipping
from
between
my
fingers
without
the
slightest
warning
in
an
instant
she
had
vanished
and
where
not
a
moment
before
she
herself
had
been
i
found
myself
confronting
a
monstrous
beetle
a
huge
writhing
creation
of
some
wild
nightmare
first
the
creature
stood
as
high
as
i
did
but
as
i
stared
at
it
in
stupefied
amazement
as
you
may
easily
imagine
the
thing
dwindled
while
i
gazed
i
did
not
stop
to
see
how
far
the
process
of
dwindling
continued
a
stark
raving
madman
for
the
nonce
i
fled
as
if
all
the
fiends
in
hell
were
at
my
heels
chapter
xxxiv
after
twenty
years
i
reached
the
open
air
i
can
not
tell
you
i
do
not
know
i
have
a
confused
recollection
of
rushing
through
vaulted
passages
through
endless
corridors
of
trampling
over
people
who
tried
to
arrest
my
passage
and
the
rest
is
blank
i
again
came
to
myself
i
was
lying
in
the
house
of
an
american
missionary
named
clements
i
had
been
found
at
early
dawn
stark
naked
in
a
cairo
street
and
picked
up
for
dead
judging
from
appearances
i
must
have
wandered
for
miles
all
through
the
night
whence
i
had
come
or
whither
i
was
going
none
could
tell
i
could
not
tell
myself
for
weeks
i
hovered
between
life
and
death
the
kindness
of
mr
and
mrs
clements
was
not
to
be
measured
by
words
i
was
brought
to
their
house
a
penniless
helpless
battered
stranger
and
they
gave
me
all
they
had
to
offer
without
money
and
without
price
with
no
expectation
of
an
earthly
reward
let
no
one
pretend
that
there
is
no
christian
charity
under
the
sun
the
debt
i
owed
that
man
and
woman
i
was
never
able
to
repay
before
i
was
properly
myself
again
and
in
a
position
to
offer
some
adequate
testimony
of
the
gratitude
i
felt
mrs
clements
was
dead
drowned
during
an
excursion
on
the
nile
and
her
husband
had
departed
on
a
missionary
expedition
into
central
africa
from
which
he
never
returned
in
a
measure
my
physical
health
returned
for
months
after
i
had
left
the
roof
of
my
hospitable
hosts
i
was
in
a
state
of
i
suffered
from
a
species
of
aphasia
for
days
together
i
was
speechless
and
could
remember
nothing
not
even
my
own
name
and
when
that
stage
had
passed
and
i
began
to
move
more
freely
among
my
fellows
for
years
i
was
but
a
wreck
of
my
former
self
i
was
visited
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
by
frightful
i
know
not
whether
to
call
them
visions
they
were
real
enough
to
me
but
since
they
were
visible
to
no
one
but
myself
perhaps
that
is
the
word
which
best
describes
them
their
presence
invariably
plunged
me
into
a
state
of
abject
terror
against
which
i
was
unable
to
even
make
a
show
of
fighting
to
such
an
extent
did
they
embitter
my
existence
that
i
voluntarily
placed
myself
under
the
treatment
of
an
expert
in
mental
pathology
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
i
was
under
his
constant
supervision
but
the
visitations
were
as
inexplicable
to
him
as
they
were
to
me
degrees
however
they
became
rarer
and
rarer
until
at
last
i
flattered
myself
that
i
had
once
more
become
as
other
men
after
an
interval
to
make
sure
i
devoted
myself
to
politics
thenceforward
i
have
lived
as
they
phrase
it
in
the
public
eye
private
life
in
any
peculiar
sense
of
the
term
i
have
had
none
mr
lessingham
ceased
his
tale
was
not
uninteresting
and
to
say
the
least
of
it
was
curious
but
i
still
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
it
had
to
do
with
me
or
what
was
the
purport
of
his
presence
in
my
room
since
he
remained
silent
as
if
the
matter
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
was
at
an
end
i
told
him
so
presume
mr
lessingham
that
all
this
is
but
a
prelude
to
the
play
at
present
i
do
not
see
where
it
is
that
i
come
in
still
for
some
seconds
he
was
silent
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
grave
and
sombre
as
if
he
were
burdened
by
a
weight
of
woe
as
you
put
it
all
this
has
been
but
a
prelude
to
the
play
were
it
not
so
i
should
not
now
stand
in
such
pressing
want
of
the
services
of
a
confidential
agent
that
is
of
an
experienced
man
of
the
world
who
has
been
endowed
by
nature
with
phenomenal
perceptive
faculties
and
in
whose
capacity
and
honour
i
can
place
the
completest
confidence
i
smiled
the
compliment
was
a
pointed
one
hope
your
estimate
of
me
is
not
too
high
hope
not
for
my
sake
as
well
as
for
your
own
i
have
heard
great
things
of
you
if
ever
man
stood
in
need
of
all
that
human
skill
and
acumen
can
do
for
him
i
certainly
am
he
his
words
aroused
my
curiosity
i
was
conscious
of
feeling
more
interested
than
heretofore
will
do
my
best
for
you
man
can
do
no
more
only
give
my
best
a
trial
will
at
once
he
looked
at
me
long
and
earnestly
then
leaning
forward
he
said
lowering
his
voice
perhaps
unconsciously
fact
is
mr
champnell
that
quite
recently
events
have
happened
which
threaten
to
bridge
the
chasm
of
twenty
years
and
to
place
me
face
to
face
with
that
plague
spot
of
the
past
at
this
moment
i
stand
in
imminent
peril
of
becoming
again
the
wretched
thing
i
was
when
i
fled
from
that
den
of
all
the
devils
it
is
to
guard
me
against
this
that
i
have
come
to
you
i
want
you
to
unravel
the
tangled
thread
which
threatens
to
drag
me
to
my
doom
and
when
unravelled
to
sunder
it
for
ever
if
god
wills
in
twain
to
be
frank
for
the
moment
i
thought
him
mad
he
went
on
weeks
ago
when
i
returned
late
one
night
from
a
sitting
in
the
house
of
commons
i
found
on
my
study
table
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
there
was
a
representation
marvellously
like
of
the
creature
into
which
as
it
seemed
to
me
the
woman
of
the
songs
was
transformed
as
i
clutched
her
throat
between
my
hands
the
mere
sight
of
it
brought
back
one
of
those
visitations
of
which
i
have
told
you
and
which
i
thought
i
had
done
with
for
ever
i
was
convulsed
by
an
agony
of
fear
thrown
into
a
state
approximating
to
a
paralysis
both
of
mind
and
body
why
can
not
tell
you
i
only
know
that
i
have
never
dared
to
allow
my
thoughts
to
recur
to
that
last
dread
scene
lest
the
mere
recurrence
should
drive
me
mad
was
this
you
found
upon
your
study
table
merely
a
drawing
was
a
representation
produced
by
what
process
i
can
not
say
which
was
so
wonderfully
so
diabolically
like
the
original
that
for
a
moment
i
thought
the
thing
itself
was
on
my
table
put
it
there
is
precisely
what
i
wish
you
to
find
out
what
i
wish
you
to
make
it
your
instant
business
to
ascertain
i
have
found
the
thing
under
similar
circumstances
on
three
separate
occasions
on
my
study
table
and
each
time
it
has
had
on
me
the
same
hideous
effect
time
after
you
have
returned
from
a
late
sitting
in
the
house
of
commons
are
these
what
shall
i
call
them
delineations
again
i
can
not
tell
you
do
you
mean
i
say
each
time
when
i
recovered
the
thing
had
vanished
of
paper
and
all
though
on
that
point
i
could
not
be
positive
you
will
understand
that
my
study
table
is
apt
to
be
littered
with
sheets
of
paper
and
i
could
not
absolutely
determine
that
the
thing
had
not
stared
at
me
from
one
of
those
the
delineation
itself
to
use
your
word
certainly
had
vanished
i
began
to
suspect
that
this
was
a
case
rather
for
a
doctor
than
for
a
man
of
my
profession
and
hinted
as
much
you
think
it
is
possible
mr
lessingham
that
you
have
been
overworking
yourself
that
you
have
been
driving
your
brain
too
hard
and
that
you
have
been
the
victim
of
an
optical
delusion
thought
so
myself
i
may
say
that
i
almost
hoped
so
but
wait
till
i
have
finished
you
will
find
that
there
is
no
loophole
in
that
direction
he
appeared
to
be
recalling
events
in
their
due
order
his
manner
was
studiously
cold
as
if
he
were
endeavouring
despite
the
strangeness
of
his
story
to
impress
me
with
the
literal
accuracy
of
each
syllable
he
uttered
night
before
last
on
returning
home
i
found
in
my
study
a
stranger
stranger
in
other
words
a
burglar
burglar
i
go
on
he
had
paused
his
demeanour
was
becoming
odder
and
odder
my
entry
he
was
engaged
in
forcing
an
entry
into
my
bureau
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
advanced
to
seize
him
but
i
could
not
could
not
how
do
you
mean
you
could
not
mean
simply
what
i
say
you
must
understand
that
this
was
no
ordinary
felon
of
what
nationality
he
was
i
can
not
tell
you
he
only
uttered
two
words
and
they
were
certainly
in
english
but
apart
from
that
he
was
dumb
he
wore
no
covering
on
his
head
or
feet
indeed
his
only
garment
was
a
long
dark
flowing
cloak
which
as
it
fluttered
about
him
revealed
that
his
limbs
were
bare
unique
costume
for
a
burglar
instant
i
saw
him
i
realised
that
he
was
in
some
way
connected
with
that
adventure
in
the
rue
de
rabagas
what
he
said
and
did
proved
it
to
the
hilt
did
he
say
and
do
i
approached
to
effect
his
capture
he
pronounced
aloud
two
words
which
recalled
that
awful
scene
the
recollection
of
which
always
lingers
in
my
brain
and
of
which
i
never
dare
to
permit
myself
to
think
their
very
utterance
threw
me
into
a
sort
of
convulsion
were
the
words
mr
lessingham
opened
his
mouth
and
shut
it
a
marked
change
took
place
in
the
expression
of
his
countenance
his
eyes
became
fixed
and
staring
resembling
the
glassy
orbs
of
the
somnambulist
for
a
moment
i
feared
that
he
was
going
to
give
me
an
object
lesson
in
the
of
which
i
had
heard
so
much
i
rose
with
a
view
of
offering
him
assistance
he
motioned
me
back
it
will
pass
away
his
voice
was
dry
and
husky
unlike
his
usual
silvern
tones
after
an
uncomfortable
interval
he
managed
to
continue
see
for
yourself
mr
champnell
what
a
miserable
weakling
when
this
subject
is
broached
i
still
remain
i
can
not
utter
the
words
the
stranger
uttered
i
can
not
even
write
them
down
for
some
inscrutable
reason
they
have
on
me
an
effect
similar
to
that
which
spells
and
incantations
had
on
people
in
tales
of
witchcraft
suppose
mr
lessingham
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
mysterious
stranger
was
not
himself
an
optical
delusion
there
is
the
evidence
of
my
servants
to
prove
the
contrary
your
servants
see
him
of
them
yes
then
there
is
the
evidence
of
the
bureau
the
fellow
had
smashed
the
top
right
in
two
when
i
came
to
examine
the
contents
i
learned
that
a
packet
of
letters
was
missing
they
were
letters
which
i
had
received
from
miss
lindon
a
lady
whom
i
hope
to
make
my
wife
this
also
i
state
to
you
in
confidence
use
would
he
be
likely
to
make
of
them
matters
stand
as
i
fear
they
do
he
might
make
a
very
serious
misuse
of
them
if
the
object
of
these
wretches
after
all
these
years
is
a
wild
revenge
they
would
be
capable
having
discovered
what
she
is
to
me
of
working
miss
lindon
a
fatal
mischief
or
at
the
very
least
of
poisoning
her
mind
how
did
the
thief
escape
did
he
like
the
delineation
vanish
into
air
escaped
by
the
much
more
prosaic
method
of
dashing
through
the
window
and
clambering
down
from
the
verandah
into
the
street
where
he
ran
right
into
someone
arms
whose
arms
a
constable
into
mr
atherton
sydney
atherton
inventor
do
you
know
him
do
sydney
atherton
and
i
are
friends
of
a
good
many
but
atherton
must
have
seen
where
he
came
from
and
anyhow
if
he
was
in
the
state
of
undress
which
you
have
described
why
did
he
stop
him
atherton
reasons
were
his
own
he
did
not
stop
him
and
so
far
as
i
can
learn
he
did
not
attempt
to
stop
him
instead
he
knocked
at
my
hall
door
to
inform
me
that
he
had
seen
a
man
climb
out
of
my
window
happen
to
know
that
at
certain
seasons
atherton
is
a
queer
fish
but
that
sounds
very
queer
indeed
truth
is
mr
champnell
that
if
it
were
not
for
mr
atherton
i
doubt
if
i
should
have
troubled
you
even
now
the
accident
of
his
being
an
acquaintance
of
yours
makes
my
task
easier
he
drew
his
chair
closer
to
me
with
an
air
of
briskness
which
had
been
foreign
to
him
before
for
some
reason
which
i
was
unable
to
fathom
the
introduction
of
atherton
name
seemed
to
have
enlivened
him
however
i
was
not
long
to
remain
in
darkness
in
half
a
dozen
sentences
he
threw
more
light
on
the
real
cause
of
his
visit
to
me
than
he
had
done
in
all
that
had
gone
before
his
bearing
too
was
more
businesslike
and
to
the
point
for
the
first
time
i
had
some
glimmerings
of
the
politician
alert
keen
eager
as
he
is
known
to
all
the
world
atherton
like
myself
has
been
a
postulant
for
miss
lindon
hand
because
i
have
succeeded
where
he
has
failed
he
has
chosen
to
be
angry
it
seems
that
he
has
had
dealings
either
with
my
visitor
of
tuesday
night
or
with
some
other
his
acquaintance
and
he
proposes
to
use
what
he
has
gleaned
from
him
to
the
disadvantage
of
my
character
i
have
just
come
from
mr
atherton
from
hints
he
dropped
i
conclude
that
probably
during
the
last
few
hours
he
has
had
an
interview
with
someone
who
was
connected
in
some
way
with
that
lurid
patch
in
my
career
that
this
person
made
revelations
which
were
nothing
but
a
series
of
monstrous
lies
and
these
revelations
mr
atherton
has
threatened
in
so
many
words
to
place
before
miss
lindon
that
is
an
eventuality
which
i
wish
to
avoid
my
own
conviction
is
that
there
is
at
this
moment
in
london
an
emissary
from
that
den
in
the
whilom
rue
de
rabagas
for
all
i
know
it
may
be
the
woman
of
the
songs
herself
whether
the
sole
purport
of
this
individual
presence
is
to
do
me
injury
i
am
as
yet
in
no
position
to
say
but
that
it
is
proposed
to
work
me
mischief
at
any
rate
by
the
way
is
plain
i
believe
that
mr
atherton
knows
more
about
this
person
individuality
and
whereabouts
than
he
has
been
willing
so
far
to
admit
i
want
you
therefore
to
ascertain
these
things
on
my
behalf
to
find
out
what
and
where
this
person
is
to
drag
her
or
him
out
into
the
light
of
day
in
short
i
want
you
to
effectually
protect
me
from
the
terrorism
which
threatens
once
more
to
overwhelm
my
mental
and
my
physical
powers
which
bids
fair
to
destroy
my
intellect
my
career
my
life
my
all
reason
have
you
for
suspecting
that
mr
atherton
has
seen
this
individual
of
whom
you
speak
has
he
told
you
so
yes
know
atherton
well
in
his
not
infrequent
moments
of
excitement
he
is
apt
to
use
strong
language
but
it
goes
no
further
i
believe
him
to
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
do
anyone
an
intentional
injustice
under
any
circumstances
whatever
if
i
go
to
him
armed
with
credentials
from
you
when
he
understands
the
real
gravity
of
the
situation
which
it
will
be
my
business
to
make
him
do
i
believe
that
spontaneously
of
his
own
accord
he
will
tell
me
as
much
about
this
mysterious
individual
as
he
knows
himself
go
to
him
at
once
i
will
the
result
i
will
communicate
to
you
i
rose
from
my
seat
as
i
did
so
someone
rushed
into
the
outer
office
with
a
din
and
a
clatter
andrews
voice
and
another
became
distinctly
audible
andrews
apparently
raised
in
vigorous
expostulation
raised
seemingly
in
vain
for
presently
the
door
of
my
own
particular
sanctum
was
thrown
open
with
a
crash
and
mr
sydney
atherton
himself
came
dashing
in
evidently
conspicuously
under
the
influence
of
one
of
those
not
infrequent
of
excitement
of
which
i
had
just
been
speaking
chapter
xxxv
a
bringer
of
tidings
atherton
did
not
wait
to
see
who
might
or
might
not
be
present
but
without
even
pausing
to
take
breath
he
broke
into
full
cry
on
the
instant
as
is
occasionally
his
wont
thank
goodness
i
found
you
in
i
want
you
at
once
do
stop
to
talk
but
stick
your
hat
on
and
put
your
best
foot
forward
i
tell
you
all
about
it
in
the
cab
i
endeavoured
to
call
his
attention
to
mr
lessingham
presence
but
without
success
dear
fellow
when
i
had
got
as
far
as
that
he
cut
me
short
dear
fellow
me
none
of
your
jabber
and
none
of
your
excuses
either
i
do
care
if
you
got
an
engagement
with
the
queen
have
to
chuck
it
where
that
dashed
hat
of
yours
or
are
you
going
without
it
do
i
tell
you
that
every
second
cut
to
waste
may
mean
the
difference
between
life
and
death
do
you
want
me
to
drag
you
down
to
the
cab
by
the
hair
of
your
head
will
try
not
to
constrain
you
to
quite
so
drastic
a
resource
and
i
was
coming
to
you
at
once
in
any
case
i
only
want
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
am
not
here
is
mr
lessingham
in
his
haste
mr
lessingham
had
gone
unnoticed
now
that
his
observation
was
particularly
directed
to
him
atherton
started
turned
and
glared
at
my
latest
client
in
a
fashion
which
was
scarcely
flattering
it
you
is
it
what
the
deuce
are
you
doing
here
before
lessingham
could
reply
to
this
most
unceremonious
query
atherton
rushing
forward
gripped
him
by
the
arm
you
seen
her
lessingham
not
unnaturally
nonplussed
by
the
other
curious
conduct
stared
at
him
in
unmistakable
amazement
i
seen
whom
lindon
lindon
lessingham
paused
he
was
evidently
asking
himself
what
the
inquiry
meant
have
not
seen
miss
lindon
since
last
night
why
do
you
ask
heaven
help
us
as
i
a
living
man
i
believe
he
she
or
it
has
got
her
his
words
were
incomprehensible
enough
to
stand
in
copious
need
of
explanation
as
mr
lessingham
plainly
thought
is
it
that
you
mean
sir
i
say
i
believe
that
that
oriental
friend
of
yours
has
got
her
in
her
clutches
if
it
is
a
her
goodness
alone
knows
what
the
infernal
conjurer
real
sex
may
be
explain
yourself
on
a
sudden
lessingham
tones
rang
out
like
a
trumpet
call
damage
comes
to
her
i
shall
be
fit
to
cut
my
throat
and
yours
mr
lessingham
next
proceeding
surprised
me
i
imagine
it
surprised
atherton
still
more
springing
at
sydney
like
a
tiger
he
caught
him
by
the
throat
you
hound
of
what
wretched
folly
have
you
been
guilty
if
so
much
as
a
hair
of
her
head
is
injured
you
shall
repay
it
me
ten
thousandfold
you
intermeddling
jealous
fool
he
shook
sydney
as
if
he
had
been
a
rat
then
flung
him
from
him
headlong
on
to
the
floor
it
reminded
me
of
nothing
so
much
as
othello
treatment
of
iago
never
had
i
seen
a
man
so
transformed
by
rage
lessingham
seemed
to
have
positively
increased
in
stature
as
he
stood
glowering
down
at
the
prostrate
sydney
he
might
have
stood
for
a
materialistic
conception
of
human
retribution
sydney
i
take
it
was
rather
surprised
than
hurt
for
a
moment
or
two
he
lay
quite
still
then
lifting
his
head
he
looked
up
his
assailant
then
raising
himself
to
his
feet
he
shook
himself
as
if
with
a
view
of
learning
if
all
his
bones
were
whole
putting
his
hands
up
to
his
neck
he
rubbed
it
gently
and
he
grinned
god
lessingham
there
more
in
you
than
i
thought
after
all
you
are
a
man
there
some
holding
power
in
those
wrists
of
yours
they
nearly
broken
my
neck
when
this
business
is
finished
i
should
like
to
put
on
the
gloves
with
you
and
fight
it
out
clean
wasted
upon
politics
damn
it
man
give
me
your
hand
mr
lessingham
did
not
give
him
his
hand
atherton
took
it
and
gave
it
a
hearty
shake
with
both
of
his
if
the
first
paroxysm
of
his
passion
had
passed
lessingham
was
still
sufficiently
stern
so
good
as
not
to
trifle
mr
atherton
if
what
you
say
is
correct
and
the
wretch
to
whom
you
allude
really
has
miss
lindon
at
her
mercy
then
the
woman
i
love
and
whom
you
also
pretend
to
love
stands
in
imminent
peril
not
only
of
a
ghastly
death
but
of
what
is
infinitely
worse
than
death
deuce
she
does
atherton
wheeled
round
towards
me
have
you
got
that
dashed
hat
of
yours
yet
do
stand
there
like
a
tailor
dummy
keeping
me
on
move
yourself
i
tell
you
all
about
it
in
the
and
lessingham
if
you
come
with
us
i
tell
you
too
chapter
xxxvi
what
the
tidings
were
three
in
a
hansom
cab
is
not
under
all
circumstances
the
most
comfortable
method
of
conveyance
when
one
of
the
trio
happens
to
be
sydney
atherton
in
one
of
his
of
excitement
it
is
distinctly
the
opposite
as
on
that
occasion
mr
lessingham
and
i
both
quickly
found
sometimes
he
sat
on
my
knees
sometimes
on
lessingham
and
frequently
when
he
unexpectedly
stood
up
and
all
but
precipitated
himself
on
to
the
horse
back
on
nobody
in
the
eagerness
of
his
gesticulations
first
he
knocked
off
my
hat
then
he
knocked
off
lessingham
then
his
own
then
all
three
together
once
his
own
hat
rolling
into
the
mud
he
sprang
into
the
road
without
previously
going
through
the
empty
form
of
advising
the
driver
of
his
intention
to
pick
it
up
when
he
turned
to
speak
to
lessingham
he
thrust
his
elbow
into
my
eye
and
when
he
turned
to
speak
to
me
he
thrust
it
into
lessingham
never
for
one
solitary
instant
was
he
at
rest
or
either
of
us
at
ease
the
wonder
is
that
the
gymnastics
in
which
he
incessantly
indulged
did
not
sufficiently
attract
public
notice
to
induce
a
policeman
to
put
at
least
a
momentary
period
to
our
progress
had
speed
not
been
of
primary
importance
i
should
have
insisted
on
the
transference
of
the
expedition
to
the
somewhat
wider
limits
of
a
his
elucidation
of
the
causes
of
his
agitation
was
apparently
more
comprehensible
to
lessingham
than
it
was
to
me
i
had
to
piece
this
and
that
together
under
considerable
difficulties
by
degrees
i
did
arrive
at
something
like
a
clear
notion
of
what
had
actually
taken
place
he
commenced
by
addressing
lessingham
and
thrusting
his
elbow
into
my
eye
marjorie
tell
you
about
the
fellow
she
found
in
the
street
up
went
his
arm
to
force
the
open
overhead
and
off
went
my
hat
then
william
henry
let
her
go
if
you
kill
the
horse
buy
you
another
we
were
already
going
much
faster
than
legally
we
ought
to
have
done
but
that
seemingly
to
him
was
not
a
matter
of
the
slightest
consequence
lessingham
replied
to
his
inquiry
did
not
know
the
fellow
i
saw
coming
out
of
your
window
marjorie
found
him
the
morning
after
in
front
of
her
window
in
the
middle
of
the
street
seems
he
had
been
wandering
about
all
night
unclothed
in
the
rain
and
the
mud
and
all
the
rest
of
it
in
a
condition
of
hypnotic
trance
is
the
gentleman
you
are
alluding
to
his
name
holt
robert
holt
is
he
an
englishman
much
so
city
out
of
a
shop
stony
broke
absolutely
got
the
chuck
from
the
casual
ward
would
let
him
in
house
full
and
that
sort
of
thing
poor
devil
pretty
passes
you
politicians
bring
men
to
you
sure
what
you
sure
that
this
man
robert
holt
is
the
same
person
whom
as
you
put
it
you
saw
coming
out
of
my
window
of
course
i
sure
think
i
did
recognise
him
besides
there
was
the
man
own
tale
owned
to
it
himself
besides
all
the
rest
which
sent
one
rushing
fulham
way
must
remember
mr
atherton
that
i
am
wholly
in
the
dark
as
to
what
has
happened
what
has
the
man
holt
to
do
with
the
errand
on
which
we
are
bound
i
not
coming
to
it
if
you
would
let
me
tell
the
tale
in
my
own
way
i
should
get
there
in
less
than
no
time
but
you
will
keep
on
cutting
in
how
the
deuce
do
you
suppose
champnell
is
to
make
head
or
tail
of
the
business
if
you
will
persist
in
interrupting
marjorie
took
the
beggar
in
he
told
his
tale
to
her
she
sent
for
me
that
was
just
now
caught
me
on
the
steps
after
i
had
been
lunching
with
dora
grayling
holt
his
yarn
i
smelt
a
rat
saw
that
a
connection
possibly
existed
between
the
thief
who
been
playing
confounded
conjuring
tricks
off
on
to
me
and
this
interesting
party
down
fulham
way
party
down
fulham
way
friend
of
holt
am
i
not
telling
you
there
you
are
you
see
wo
let
me
finish
when
holt
slipped
through
the
window
which
is
the
most
sensible
thing
he
seems
to
have
done
if
i
been
in
his
shoes
i
have
slipped
through
forty
windows
dusky
coloured
charmer
caught
him
on
the
hop
doctored
him
sent
him
out
to
commit
burglary
by
deputy
i
said
to
holt
show
us
this
agreeable
little
crib
young
man
holt
was
game
then
marjorie
chipped
in
she
wanted
to
go
and
see
it
too
i
said
you
be
sorry
if
you
do
that
settled
it
after
that
she
have
gone
if
she
died
i
never
did
have
a
persuasive
way
with
women
so
off
we
toddled
marjorie
holt
and
i
in
a
growler
spotted
the
crib
in
less
than
no
time
invited
ourselves
in
by
the
kitchen
window
house
seemed
empty
presently
holt
became
hypnotised
before
my
eyes
the
best
established
case
of
hypnotism
by
suggestion
i
ever
yet
encountered
started
off
on
a
pilgrimage
of
one
like
an
idiot
i
followed
leaving
marjorie
to
wait
for
me
am
i
not
telling
you
great
scott
lessingham
in
the
house
of
commons
they
must
be
hazy
to
think
you
smart
i
said
i
send
the
first
sane
soul
i
meet
to
keep
you
company
as
luck
would
have
it
i
never
met
one
only
kids
and
a
baker
who
would
leave
his
cart
or
take
it
with
him
either
i
covered
pretty
nearly
two
miles
before
i
came
across
a
peeler
and
when
i
did
the
man
was
cracked
and
he
thought
me
mad
or
drunk
or
both
by
the
time
i
got
myself
within
nodding
distance
of
being
run
in
for
obstructing
the
police
in
the
execution
of
their
duty
without
inducing
him
to
move
a
single
one
of
his
feet
holt
was
out
of
sight
so
since
all
my
pains
in
his
direction
were
clean
thrown
away
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
scurry
back
to
marjorie
so
i
scurried
and
i
found
the
house
empty
no
one
there
and
marjorie
gone
i
do
quite
follow
atherton
impetuously
declined
to
allow
mr
lessingham
to
conclude
course
you
do
quite
follow
and
you
follow
still
less
if
you
will
keep
getting
in
front
i
went
upstairs
and
downstairs
inside
and
out
shouted
myself
hoarse
as
a
crow
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
marjorie
or
heard
until
as
i
was
coming
down
the
stairs
for
about
the
time
i
stepped
on
something
hard
which
was
lying
in
the
passage
i
picked
it
up
it
was
a
ring
this
ring
its
shape
is
not
just
what
it
was
i
not
as
light
as
gossamer
especially
when
i
come
jumping
downstairs
six
at
a
time
but
what
left
of
it
is
here
sydney
held
something
in
front
of
him
mr
lessingham
wriggled
to
one
side
to
enable
him
to
see
then
he
made
a
snatch
at
it
mine
sydney
dodged
it
out
of
his
reach
do
you
mean
it
yours
the
ring
i
gave
marjorie
for
an
engagement
ring
give
it
me
you
hound
unless
you
wish
me
to
do
you
violence
in
the
cab
with
complete
disregard
of
the
limitations
of
space
or
of
my
comfort
lessingham
thrust
him
vigorously
aside
then
gripping
sydney
by
the
wrist
he
seized
the
gaud
sydney
yielding
it
just
in
time
to
save
himself
from
being
precipitated
into
the
street
ravished
of
his
treasure
sydney
turned
and
surveyed
the
ravisher
with
something
like
a
glance
of
admiration
me
lessingham
if
i
do
believe
there
is
some
warm
blood
in
those
fishlike
veins
of
yours
please
the
piper
i
live
to
fight
you
after
all
with
the
bare
ones
sir
as
a
gentleman
should
do
lessingham
seemed
to
pay
no
attention
to
him
whatever
he
was
surveying
the
ring
which
sydney
had
trampled
out
of
shape
with
looks
of
the
deepest
concern
ring
the
one
i
gave
her
something
serious
must
have
happened
to
her
before
she
would
have
dropped
my
ring
and
left
it
lying
where
it
fell
atherton
went
on
it
what
has
happened
to
her
i
be
dashed
if
i
know
when
it
was
clear
that
there
she
was
i
tore
off
to
find
out
where
she
was
came
across
old
lindon
he
knew
nothing
i
rather
fancy
i
startled
him
in
the
middle
of
pall
mall
when
i
left
he
stared
after
me
like
one
possessed
and
his
hat
was
lying
in
the
gutter
went
home
she
was
there
asked
dora
grayling
she
seen
nothing
of
her
no
one
had
seen
anything
of
her
she
had
vanished
into
air
then
i
said
to
myself
you
a
idiot
on
my
honour
while
you
looking
for
her
like
a
lost
sheep
the
betting
is
that
the
girl
in
holt
friend
house
the
whole
jolly
time
when
you
were
there
the
chances
are
that
she
just
stepped
out
for
a
stroll
and
that
now
she
back
again
and
wondering
where
on
earth
you
gone
so
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
fly
back
and
see
because
the
idea
of
her
standing
on
the
front
doorstep
looking
for
me
while
i
was
going
off
my
nut
looking
for
her
commended
itself
to
what
i
call
my
sense
of
humour
and
on
my
way
it
struck
me
that
it
would
be
the
part
of
wisdom
to
pick
up
champnell
because
if
there
is
a
man
who
can
be
backed
to
find
a
needle
in
any
amount
of
it
is
the
great
that
horse
has
moved
itself
after
all
because
here
we
are
now
cabman
do
go
driving
further
on
you
have
to
put
a
girdle
round
the
earth
if
you
do
because
you
have
to
reach
this
point
again
before
you
get
your
this
is
the
magician
house
chapter
xxxvii
what
was
hidden
under
the
floor
the
cab
pulled
up
in
front
of
a
tumbledown
cheap
in
an
unfinished
cheap
neighbourhood
the
whole
place
a
living
monument
of
the
defeat
of
the
speculative
builder
atherton
leaped
out
on
to
the
rubble
which
was
meant
for
a
footpath
do
see
marjorie
looking
for
me
on
the
doorstep
nor
did
i
i
saw
nothing
but
what
appeared
to
be
an
unoccupied
ramshackle
brick
abomination
suddenly
sydney
gave
an
exclamation
the
front
door
closed
i
was
hard
at
his
heels
do
you
mean
when
i
went
i
left
the
front
door
open
it
looks
as
if
i
made
an
idiot
of
myself
after
all
and
marjorie
returned
let
hope
to
goodness
that
i
have
he
knocked
while
we
waited
for
a
response
i
questioned
him
did
you
leave
the
door
open
when
you
went
hardly
know
i
imagine
that
it
was
with
some
dim
idea
of
being
able
to
get
in
if
she
returned
while
i
was
absent
but
the
truth
is
i
was
in
such
a
condition
of
helter
skelter
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
swear
that
i
had
any
reasonable
reason
suppose
there
is
no
doubt
that
you
did
leave
it
open
none
on
that
i
stake
my
life
it
open
when
you
returned
from
your
pursuit
of
holt
open
i
walked
straight
in
expecting
to
find
her
waiting
for
me
in
the
front
room
i
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
when
i
found
she
there
there
any
signs
of
a
struggle
there
were
no
signs
of
anything
everything
was
just
as
i
had
left
it
with
the
exception
of
the
ring
which
i
trod
on
in
the
passage
and
which
lessingham
has
miss
lindon
has
returned
it
does
not
look
as
if
she
were
in
the
house
at
present
it
did
not
unless
silence
had
such
meaning
atherton
had
knocked
loudly
three
times
without
succeeding
in
attracting
the
slightest
notice
from
within
strikes
me
that
this
is
another
case
of
seeking
admission
through
that
hospitable
window
at
the
back
atherton
led
the
way
to
the
rear
lessingham
and
i
followed
there
was
not
even
an
apology
for
a
yard
still
less
a
garden
there
was
not
even
a
fence
of
any
sort
to
serve
as
an
enclosure
and
to
shut
off
the
house
from
the
wilderness
of
waste
land
the
kitchen
window
was
open
i
asked
sydney
if
he
had
left
it
so
do
know
i
dare
say
we
did
i
do
fancy
that
either
of
us
stood
on
the
order
of
his
coming
while
he
spoke
he
scrambled
over
the
sill
we
followed
when
he
was
in
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
marjorie
speak
to
me
marjorie
it
is
i
sydney
the
words
echoed
through
the
house
only
silence
answered
he
led
the
way
to
the
front
room
suddenly
he
stopped
he
cried
blind
down
i
had
noticed
when
we
were
outside
that
the
blind
was
down
at
the
front
room
window
was
up
when
i
went
that
i
swear
that
someone
has
been
here
is
pretty
plain
let
hope
it
marjorie
he
had
only
taken
a
step
forward
into
the
room
when
he
again
stopped
short
to
exclaim
stars
here
a
sudden
clearance
why
the
place
is
empty
everything
clean
gone
do
you
mean
was
it
furnished
when
you
left
the
room
was
empty
enough
then
i
do
know
that
it
was
exactly
what
you
call
furnished
the
party
who
ran
this
establishment
had
a
taste
in
upholstery
which
was
all
his
own
but
there
was
a
carpet
and
a
bed
and
and
lots
of
things
for
the
most
part
i
should
have
said
distinctly
eastern
curiosities
they
seem
to
have
evaporated
into
smoke
which
may
be
a
way
which
is
common
enough
among
eastern
curiosities
though
it
queer
to
me
atherton
was
staring
about
him
as
if
he
found
it
difficult
to
credit
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
long
ago
is
it
since
you
left
he
referred
to
his
watch
over
an
hour
possibly
an
hour
and
a
half
i
could
swear
to
the
exact
moment
but
it
certainly
is
more
you
notice
any
signs
of
packing
up
a
sign
going
to
the
window
he
drew
up
the
blind
speaking
as
he
did
so
queer
thing
about
this
business
is
that
when
we
first
got
in
this
blind
would
draw
up
a
little
bit
so
since
it
would
go
up
i
pulled
it
down
roller
and
all
now
it
draws
up
as
easily
and
smoothly
as
if
it
had
always
been
the
best
blind
that
ever
lived
standing
at
sydney
back
i
saw
that
the
cabman
on
his
box
was
signalling
to
us
with
his
outstretched
hand
sydney
perceived
him
too
he
threw
up
the
sash
the
matter
with
you
me
sir
but
who
the
old
gent
old
gent
the
old
gent
peeping
through
the
window
of
the
room
upstairs
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
the
driver
mouth
when
sydney
was
through
the
door
and
flying
up
the
staircase
i
followed
rather
more
soberly
his
methods
were
a
little
too
flighty
for
me
when
i
reached
the
landing
dashing
out
of
the
front
room
he
rushed
into
the
one
at
the
back
then
through
a
door
at
the
side
he
came
out
shouting
the
idiot
mean
with
his
old
gent
i
old
gent
him
if
i
got
him
there
not
a
creature
about
the
place
he
returned
into
the
front
room
i
at
his
heels
that
certainly
was
empty
and
not
only
empty
but
it
showed
no
traces
of
recent
occupation
the
dust
lay
thick
upon
the
floor
there
was
that
mouldy
earthy
smell
which
is
so
frequently
found
in
apartments
which
have
been
long
untenanted
you
sure
atherton
that
there
is
no
one
at
the
back
course
i
sure
you
can
go
and
see
for
yourself
if
you
like
do
you
think
i
blind
jehu
drunk
throwing
up
the
sash
he
addressed
the
driver
do
you
mean
with
your
old
gent
at
the
window
what
window
window
sir
to
you
dreaming
man
there
no
one
here
your
pardon
sir
but
there
was
someone
there
not
a
minute
ago
cabman
the
slant
of
the
light
on
the
glass
or
your
eyesight
defective
me
sir
but
it
not
my
imagination
and
my
eyesight
as
good
as
any
man
in
england
and
as
for
the
slant
of
the
light
on
the
glass
there
ai
much
glass
for
the
light
to
slant
on
i
saw
him
peeping
through
that
bottom
broken
pane
on
your
left
hand
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
he
must
be
somewhere
about
he
ca
have
got
away
at
the
back
ai
there
a
cupboard
nor
nothing
where
he
could
hide
the
cabman
manner
was
so
extremely
earnest
that
i
went
myself
to
see
there
was
a
cupboard
on
the
landing
but
the
door
of
that
stood
wide
open
and
that
obviously
was
bare
the
room
behind
was
small
and
despite
the
splintered
glass
in
the
window
frame
stuffy
fragments
of
glass
kept
company
with
the
dust
on
the
floor
together
with
a
choice
collection
of
stones
brickbats
and
other
missiles
which
not
improbably
were
the
cause
of
their
being
there
in
the
corner
stood
a
cupboard
but
a
momentary
examination
showed
that
that
was
as
bare
as
the
other
the
door
at
the
side
which
sydney
had
left
wide
open
opened
on
to
a
closet
and
that
was
empty
i
glanced
up
there
was
no
trap
door
which
led
to
the
roof
no
practicable
nook
or
cranny
in
which
a
living
being
could
lie
concealed
was
anywhere
at
hand
i
returned
to
sydney
shoulder
to
tell
the
cabman
so
is
no
place
in
which
anyone
could
hide
and
there
is
no
one
in
either
of
the
rooms
you
must
have
been
mistaken
driver
the
man
waxed
wroth
tell
me
how
could
i
come
to
think
i
saw
something
when
i
did
eyes
are
apt
to
play
us
tricks
how
could
you
see
what
there
what
i
want
to
know
as
i
drove
up
before
you
told
me
to
stop
i
saw
him
looking
through
the
window
the
one
at
which
you
are
got
his
nose
glued
to
the
broken
pane
and
was
staring
as
hard
as
he
could
stare
when
i
pulled
up
off
he
started
i
saw
him
get
up
off
his
knees
and
go
to
the
back
of
the
room
when
the
gentleman
took
to
knocking
back
he
came
to
the
same
old
spot
and
flopped
down
on
his
knees
i
did
know
what
caper
you
was
up
to
you
might
be
bum
bailiffs
for
all
i
knew
and
i
supposed
that
he
was
so
anxious
to
let
you
in
as
you
might
be
to
get
inside
and
that
was
why
he
take
no
notice
of
your
knocking
while
all
the
while
he
kept
a
eye
on
what
was
going
on
when
you
goes
round
to
the
back
up
he
gets
again
and
i
reckoned
that
he
was
going
to
meet
yer
and
perhaps
give
yer
a
bit
of
his
mind
and
that
presently
i
should
hear
a
shindy
or
that
something
would
happen
but
when
you
pulls
up
the
blind
downstairs
to
my
surprise
back
he
come
once
more
he
shoves
his
old
nose
right
through
the
smash
in
the
pane
and
wags
his
old
head
at
me
like
a
chattering
magpie
that
did
seem
to
me
quite
the
civil
thing
to
do
i
had
done
no
harm
to
him
so
i
gives
you
the
office
and
lets
you
know
that
he
was
there
but
for
you
to
say
that
he
was
there
and
never
had
been
blimey
that
cops
the
biscuit
if
he
was
there
all
i
can
say
is
i
ai
here
and
my
ai
here
and
my
cab
ai
neither
damn
it
the
house
ai
here
and
nothing
ai
he
settled
himself
on
his
perch
with
an
air
of
the
most
extreme
ill
usage
he
had
been
standing
up
to
tell
his
tale
that
the
man
was
serious
was
unmistakable
as
he
himself
suggested
what
inducement
could
he
have
had
to
tell
a
lie
like
that
that
he
believed
himself
to
have
seen
what
he
declared
he
saw
was
plain
but
on
the
other
hand
what
could
have
become
in
the
space
of
fifty
seconds
of
his
gent
atherton
put
a
question
did
he
look
like
this
old
gent
of
yours
that
i
should
hardly
like
to
say
it
was
much
of
his
face
i
could
see
only
his
face
and
his
eyes
and
they
was
pretty
he
kept
a
thing
over
his
head
all
the
time
as
if
he
did
want
too
much
to
be
seen
sort
of
a
thing
one
of
them
cloak
sort
of
things
like
them
arab
blokes
used
to
wear
what
used
to
be
at
earl
court
exhibition
you
know
this
piece
of
information
seemed
to
interest
my
companions
more
than
anything
he
had
said
before
burnoose
do
you
mean
am
i
to
know
what
the
thing
called
i
ai
up
in
foreign
languages
likely
all
i
know
that
them
arab
blokes
what
was
at
earl
court
used
to
walk
about
in
them
all
over
the
place
sometimes
they
wore
them
over
their
heads
and
sometimes
they
did
in
fact
if
you
asked
me
instead
of
trying
to
make
out
as
i
sees
double
or
things
what
was
only
inside
my
own
noddle
or
something
or
other
i
should
have
said
this
here
old
gent
what
i
been
telling
you
about
was
a
arab
bloke
when
he
gets
off
his
knees
to
sneak
away
from
the
window
i
could
see
that
he
had
his
cloak
thing
what
was
over
his
head
wrapped
all
round
him
mr
lessingham
turned
to
me
all
quivering
with
excitement
believe
that
what
he
says
is
true
where
can
this
mysterious
old
gentleman
have
got
to
can
you
suggest
an
explanation
it
is
strange
to
say
the
least
of
it
that
the
cabman
should
be
the
only
person
to
see
or
hear
anything
of
him
devil
trick
has
been
played
i
know
it
i
feel
it
my
instinct
tells
me
so
i
stared
in
such
a
matter
one
hardly
expects
a
man
of
paul
lessingham
stamp
to
talk
of
atherton
stared
too
then
on
a
sudden
he
burst
out

the

soon
as
i
put
my
nose

we
westerns
are
among
the
rudiments
we
everything
to
learn
orientals
leave
us
at
the
post

their
civilisation
what
we
pleased
to
call
extinct
their
conjuring
when
you
get
to
know
it
is
all
alive
oh
he
moved
towards
the
door
as
he
went
he
slipped
or
seemed
to
all
but
stumbling
on
to
his
knees
tripped
me
up
what
this
he
was
stamping
on
the
floor
with
his
foot
a
board
loose
come
and
lend
me
a
hand
one
of
you
fellows
to
get
it
up
who
knows
what
mystery
beneath
i
went
to
his
aid
as
he
said
a
board
in
the
floor
was
loose
his
stepping
on
it
unawares
had
caused
his
stumble
together
we
prised
it
out
of
its
place
lessingham
standing
by
and
watching
us
the
while
having
removed
it
we
peered
into
the
cavity
it
disclosed
there
was
something
there
cried
atherton
a
woman
clothing
chapter
xxxviii
the
rest
of
the
find
it
was
a
woman
clothing
beyond
a
doubt
all
thrown
in
anyhow
as
if
the
person
who
had
placed
it
there
had
been
in
a
desperate
hurry
an
entire
outfit
was
there
shoes
stockings
body
linen
corsets
and
all
even
to
hat
gloves
and
hairpins
these
latter
were
mixed
up
with
the
rest
of
the
garments
in
strange
confusion
it
seemed
plain
that
whoever
had
worn
those
clothes
had
been
stripped
to
the
skin
lessingham
and
sydney
stared
at
me
in
silence
as
i
dragged
them
out
and
laid
them
on
the
floor
the
dress
was
at
the
bottom
it
was
an
alpaca
of
a
pretty
shade
in
blue
bedecked
with
lace
and
ribbons
as
is
the
fashion
of
the
hour
and
lined
with
silk
it
had
perhaps
been
a
confection
once
and
that
a
very
recent
one
but
now
it
was
all
soiled
and
creased
and
torn
and
tumbled
the
two
spectators
made
a
simultaneous
pounce
at
it
as
i
brought
it
to
the
light
god
cried
sydney
marjorie
she
was
wearing
it
when
i
saw
her
last
marjorie
gasped
lessingham
he
was
clutching
at
the
ruined
costume
staring
at
it
like
a
man
who
has
just
received
sentence
of
death
wore
it
when
she
was
with
me
yesterday
i
told
her
how
it
suited
her
and
how
pretty
it
was
there
was
silence
it
was
an
eloquent
find
it
spoke
for
itself
the
two
men
gazed
at
the
heap
of
feminine
glories
it
might
have
been
the
most
wonderful
sight
they
ever
had
seen
lessingham
was
the
first
to
speak
his
face
had
all
at
once
grown
grey
and
haggard
has
happened
to
her
i
replied
to
his
question
with
another
you
sure
this
is
miss
linden
dress
am
sure
and
were
proof
needed
here
it
is
he
had
found
the
pocket
and
was
turning
out
the
contents
there
was
a
purse
which
contained
money
and
some
visiting
cards
on
which
were
her
name
and
address
a
small
bunch
of
keys
with
her
nameplate
attached
a
handkerchief
with
her
initials
in
a
corner
the
question
of
ownership
was
placed
beyond
a
doubt
see
said
lessingham
exhibiting
the
money
which
was
in
the
purse
is
not
robbery
which
has
been
attempted
here
are
two
notes
and
one
for
five
besides
gold
and
silver
over
thirty
pounds
in
all
atherton
who
had
been
turning
over
the
accumulation
of
rubbish
between
the
joists
proclaimed
another
find
are
her
rings
and
watch
and
a
bracelet
no
it
certainly
does
not
look
as
if
theft
had
been
an
object
lessingham
was
glowering
at
him
with
knitted
brows
have
to
thank
you
for
this
sydney
was
unwontedly
meek
are
hard
on
me
lessingham
harder
than
i
deserve
i
had
rather
have
thrown
away
my
own
life
than
have
suffered
misadventure
to
have
come
to
her
are
idle
words
had
you
not
meddled
this
would
not
have
happened
a
fool
works
more
mischief
with
his
folly
than
of
malice
prepense
if
hurt
has
befallen
marjorie
lindon
you
shall
account
for
it
to
me
with
your
life
blood
it
be
so
said
sydney
am
content
if
hurt
has
come
to
marjorie
god
knows
that
i
am
willing
enough
that
death
should
come
to
me
while
they
wrangled
i
continued
to
search
a
little
to
one
side
under
the
flooring
which
was
still
intact
i
saw
something
gleam
by
stretching
out
my
hand
i
could
just
manage
to
reach
it
it
was
a
long
plait
of
woman
hair
it
had
been
cut
off
at
the
roots
so
close
to
the
head
in
one
place
that
the
scalp
itself
had
been
cut
so
that
the
hair
was
clotted
with
blood
they
were
so
occupied
with
each
other
that
they
took
no
notice
of
me
i
had
to
call
their
attention
to
my
discovery
i
fear
that
i
have
here
something
which
will
distress
you
is
not
this
miss
lindon
hair
they
recognised
it
on
the
instant
lessingham
snatching
it
from
my
hands
pressed
it
to
his
lips
is
mine
i
shall
at
least
have
something
he
spoke
with
a
grimness
which
was
a
little
startling
he
held
the
silken
tresses
at
arm
length
points
to
murder
foul
cruel
causeless
murder
as
i
live
i
will
devote
my
all
money
time
reputation
to
gaining
vengeance
on
the
wretch
who
did
this
deed
atherton
chimed
in
that
i
say
amen
he
lifted
his
hand
is
my
witness
seems
to
me
gentlemen
that
we
move
too
fast
to
my
mind
it
does
not
by
any
means
of
necessity
point
to
murder
on
the
contrary
i
doubt
if
murder
has
been
done
indeed
i
do
mind
owning
that
i
have
a
theory
of
my
own
which
points
all
the
other
way
lessingham
caught
me
by
the
sleeve
champnell
tell
me
your
theory
will
a
little
later
of
course
it
may
be
altogether
wrong
though
i
fancy
it
is
not
i
will
explain
my
reasons
when
we
come
to
talk
of
it
but
at
present
there
are
things
which
must
be
done
vote
for
tearing
up
every
board
in
the
house
cried
sydney
for
pulling
the
whole
infernal
place
to
pieces
it
a
i
should
be
surprised
if
cabby
old
gent
is
staring
at
us
all
the
while
from
some
peephole
of
his
own
we
examined
the
entire
house
methodically
so
far
as
we
were
able
inch
by
inch
not
another
board
proved
loose
to
lift
those
which
were
nailed
down
required
tools
and
those
we
were
without
we
sounded
all
the
walls
with
the
exception
of
the
party
walls
they
were
the
usual
lath
and
plaster
constructions
and
showed
no
signs
of
having
been
tampered
with
the
ceilings
were
intact
if
anything
was
concealed
in
them
it
must
have
been
there
some
time
the
cement
was
old
and
dirty
we
took
the
closet
to
pieces
examined
the
chimneys
peered
into
the
kitchen
oven
and
the
copper
in
short
we
pried
into
everything
which
with
the
limited
means
at
our
disposal
could
be
pried
into
without
result
at
the
end
we
found
ourselves
dusty
dirty
and
discomfited
the
cabman
gent
remained
as
much
a
mystery
as
ever
and
no
further
trace
had
been
discovered
of
miss
lindon
atherton
made
no
effort
to
disguise
his
chagrin
what
to
be
done
there
seems
to
be
just
nothing
in
the
place
at
all
and
yet
that
there
is
and
that
it
the
key
to
the
whole
confounded
business
i
should
be
disposed
to
swear
that
case
i
would
suggest
that
you
should
stay
and
look
for
it
the
cabman
can
go
and
look
for
the
requisite
tools
or
a
workman
to
assist
you
if
you
like
for
my
part
it
appears
to
me
that
evidence
of
another
sort
is
for
the
moment
of
paramount
importance
and
i
propose
to
commence
my
search
for
it
by
making
a
call
at
the
house
which
is
over
the
way
i
had
observed
on
our
arrival
that
the
road
only
contained
two
houses
which
were
in
anything
like
a
finished
state
that
which
we
were
in
and
another
some
fifty
or
sixty
yards
further
down
on
the
opposite
side
it
was
to
this
i
referred
the
twain
immediately
proffered
their
companionship
will
come
with
you
said
mr
lessingham
i
echoed
sydney
leave
this
sweet
homestead
in
charge
of
the
cabman
i
pull
it
to
pieces
afterwards
he
went
out
and
spoke
to
the
driver
we
going
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
little
crib
over
there
you
keep
an
eye
on
this
one
and
if
you
see
a
sign
of
anyone
being
about
the
place
living
or
dead
or
anyhow
you
give
me
a
yell
i
shall
be
on
the
lookout
and
i
be
with
you
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
bet
i
yell
i
raise
the
hair
right
off
you
the
fellow
grinned
i
do
know
if
you
gents
are
hiring
me
by
the
day
i
want
to
change
my
horse
he
ought
to
have
been
in
his
stable
a
couple
of
hours
ago
mind
your
horse
let
him
rest
a
couple
of
hours
extra
to
make
up
for
those
he
has
lost
i
take
care
you
do
lose
anything
by
this
little
job
or
your
horse
by
the
way
look
here
this
will
be
better
than
yelling
taking
a
revolver
out
of
his
trousers
pocket
he
handed
it
up
to
the
grinning
driver
that
old
gent
of
yours
does
appear
you
have
a
pop
at
him
i
shall
hear
that
easier
than
a
yell
you
can
put
a
bullet
through
him
if
you
like
i
give
you
my
word
it
wo
be
murder
do
care
if
it
is
declared
the
cabman
handling
the
weapon
like
one
who
was
familiar
with
arms
of
precision
used
to
fancy
my
revolver
shooting
when
i
was
with
the
colours
and
if
i
do
get
a
chance
i
put
a
shot
through
the
old
hunks
if
only
to
prove
to
you
that
no
liar
whether
the
man
was
in
earnest
or
not
i
could
not
tell
nor
whether
atherton
meant
what
he
said
in
answer
you
shoot
him
i
give
you
fifty
pounds
right
the
driver
laughed

my
best

earn

chapter

miss
louisa
coleman
that
the
house
over
the
way
was
tenanted
was
plain
to
all
the
world
at
least
one
occupant
sat
gazing
through
the
window
of
the
first
floor
front
room
an
old
woman
in
a
cap
one
of
those
large
caps
which
our
grandmothers
used
to
wear
tied
with
strings
under
the
chin
it
was
a
bow
window
and
as
she
was
seated
in
the
bay
looking
right
in
our
direction
she
could
hardly
have
failed
to
see
us
as
we
advanced
indeed
she
continued
to
stare
at
us
all
the
while
with
placid
calmness
yet
i
knocked
once
twice
and
yet
again
without
the
slightest
notice
being
taken
of
my
summons
sydney
gave
expression
to
his
impatience
in
his
own
peculiar
vein
in
this
part
of
the
world
seem
intended
for
ornament
only
nobody
seems
to
pay
any
attention
to
them
when
they
used
the
old
lady
upstairs
must
be
either
deaf
or
dotty
he
went
out
into
the
road
to
see
if
she
still
was
there
looking
at
me
as
calmly
as
you
please
what
does
she
think
we
doing
here
i
wonder
playing
a
tune
on
her
front
door
by
way
of
a
little
amusement
madam
he
took
off
his
hat
and
waved
it
to
her
might
i
observe
that
if
you
wo
condescend
to
notice
that
we
here
your
front
door
will
run
the
risk
of
being
severely
injured
she
do
care
for
me
any
more
than
if
i
was
nothing
at
all
sound
another
tattoo
upon
that
knocker
perhaps
she
so
deaf
that
nothing
short
of
a
cataclysmal
uproar
will
reach
her
auditory
nerves
she
immediately
proved
however
that
she
was
nothing
of
the
sort
hardly
had
the
sounds
of
my
further
knocking
died
away
than
throwing
up
the
window
she
thrust
out
her
head
and
addressed
me
in
a
fashion
which
under
the
circumstances
was
as
unexpected
as
it
was
uncalled
for
young
man
you
need
be
in
such
a
hurry
sydney
explained
me
madam
it
not
so
much
a
hurry
we
in
as
pressed
for
time
this
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
she
turned
her
attention
to
sydney
speaking
with
a
frankness
for
which
i
imagine
he
was
unprepared
do
want
none
of
your
imperence
young
man
i
seen
you
before
you
been
hanging
about
here
the
whole
day
long
and
i
do
like
the
looks
of
you
and
so
i
let
you
know
that
my
front
door
and
that
my
knocker
i
come
down
and
open
when
i
like
but
i
not
going
to
be
hurried
and
if
the
knocker
so
much
as
touched
again
i
wo
come
down
at
all
she
closed
the
window
with
a
bang
sydney
seemed
divided
between
mirth
and
indignation
a
nice
old
lady
on
my
honour
one
of
the
good
old
crusty
sort
agreeable
characters
this
neighbourhood
seems
to
grow
a
sojourn
hereabouts
should
do
one
good
unfortunately
i
do
feel
disposed
just
now
to
stand
and
kick
my
heels
in
the
road
again
saluting
the
old
dame
by
raising
his
hat
he
shouted
to
her
at
the
top
of
his
voice
i
beg
ten
thousand
pardons
for
troubling
you
but
this
is
a
matter
in
which
every
second
is
of
vital
importance
would
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
one
or
two
questions
up
went
the
window
out
came
the
old
lady
head
young
man
you
need
put
yourself
out
to
holler
at
me
i
be
hollered
at
i
come
down
and
open
that
door
in
five
minutes
by
the
clock
on
my
mantelpiece
and
not
a
moment
before
the
fiat
delivered
down
came
the
window
sydney
looked
rueful
he
consulted
his
watch
do
know
what
you
think
champnell
but
i
really
doubt
if
this
comfortable
creature
can
tell
us
anything
worth
waiting
another
five
minutes
to
hear
we
must
let
the
grass
grow
under
our
feet
and
time
is
getting
on
i
was
of
a
different
opinion
and
said
so
afraid
atherton
that
i
ca
agree
with
you
she
seems
to
have
noticed
you
hanging
about
all
day
and
it
is
at
least
possible
that
she
has
noticed
a
good
deal
which
would
be
well
worth
our
hearing
what
more
promising
witness
are
we
likely
to
find
her
house
is
the
only
one
which
overlooks
the
one
we
have
just
quitted
i
am
of
opinion
that
it
may
not
only
prove
well
worth
our
while
to
wait
five
minutes
but
also
that
it
would
be
as
well
if
possible
not
to
offend
her
by
the
way
she
not
likely
to
afford
us
the
information
we
require
if
you
do
if
that
what
you
think
i
sure
i
willing
to
wait
only
it
to
be
hoped
that
that
clock
upon
her
mantelpiece
moves
quicker
than
its
mistress
presently
when
about
a
minute
had
gone
he
called
to
the
cabman
a
sign
of
anything
the
cabman
shouted
back
a
sign
you
hear
a
sound
of
popguns
when
i
do
those
five
minutes
did
seem
long
ones
but
at
last
sydney
from
his
post
of
vantage
in
the
road
informed
us
that
the
old
lady
was
moving
getting
up
she
leaving
the
window
let
hope
to
goodness
she
coming
down
to
open
the
door
that
been
the
longest
five
minutes
i
known
i
could
hear
uncertain
footsteps
descending
the
stairs
they
came
along
the
passage
the
door
was
opened
the
chain
the
old
lady
peered
at
us
through
an
aperture
of
about
six
inches
do
know
what
you
young
men
think
you
after
but
have
all
three
of
you
in
my
house
i
wo
i
have
him
and
you
a
skinny
finger
was
pointed
to
lessingham
and
me
then
it
was
directed
towards
atherton
have
him
i
wo
so
if
it
anything
particular
you
want
to
say
to
me
you
just
tell
him
to
go
away
on
hearing
this
sydney
humility
was
abject
his
hat
was
in
his
hand
he
bent
himself
double
me
to
make
you
a
million
apologies
madam
if
i
have
in
any
way
offended
you
nothing
i
assure
you
could
have
been
farther
from
my
intention
or
from
my
thoughts
do
want
none
of
your
apologies
and
i
do
want
none
of
you
neither
i
do
like
the
looks
of
you
and
so
i
tell
you
before
i
let
anybody
into
my
house
you
have
to
sling
your
hook
the
door
was
banged
in
our
faces
i
turned
to
sydney
sooner
you
go
the
better
it
will
be
for
us
you
can
wait
for
us
over
the
way
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
groaned
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
i
must
i
suppose
i
must
it
the
first
time
i
been
refused
admittance
to
a
lady
house
in
all
my
life
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
this
thing
if
you
keep
me
waiting
long
i
tear
that
infernal
den
to
pieces
he
sauntered
across
the
road
viciously
kicking
the
stones
as
he
went
the
door
reopened
that
other
young
man
gone
has
now
i
let
you
in
have
him
inside
my
house
i
wo
the
chain
was
removed
lessingham
and
i
entered
then
the
door
was
refastened
and
the
chain
replaced
our
hostess
showed
us
into
the
front
room
on
the
ground
floor
it
was
sparsely
furnished
and
not
too
clean
but
there
were
chairs
enough
for
us
to
sit
upon
which
she
insisted
on
our
occupying
down
do
i
ca
abide
to
see
folks
standing
it
gives
me
the
fidgets
so
soon
as
we
were
seated
without
any
overture
on
our
parts
she
plunged
in
medias
res
know
what
it
is
you
come
about
i
know
you
want
me
to
tell
you
who
it
is
as
lives
in
the
house
over
the
road
well
i
can
tell
you
and
i
dare
bet
a
shilling
that
i
about
the
only
one
who
can
i
inclined
my
head
is
that
so
madam
she
was
huffed
at
once
madam
me
i
ca
bear
none
of
your
lip
service
i
a
woman
that
what
i
am
and
i
like
other
people
tongues
to
be
as
plain
as
mine
my
name
miss
louisa
coleman
but
generally
called
miss
coleman
i
only
called
louisa
by
my
relatives
since
she
was
apparently
between
seventy
and
eighty
and
looked
every
year
of
her
apparent
age
i
deemed
that
possible
miss
coleman
was
evidently
a
character
if
one
was
desirous
of
getting
information
out
of
her
it
would
be
necessary
to
allow
her
to
impart
it
in
her
own
manner
to
endeavour
to
induce
her
to
impart
it
in
anybody
would
be
time
clean
wasted
we
had
sydney
fate
before
our
eyes
she
started
with
a
sort
of
roundabout
preamble
property
is
mine
it
was
left
me
by
my
uncle
the
late
george
henry
jobson
he
buried
in
hammersmith
cemetery
just
over
the
way
he
left
me
the
whole
of
it
it
one
of
the
finest
building
sites
near
london
and
it
increases
in
value
every
year
and
i
not
going
to
let
it
for
another
twenty
by
which
time
the
value
will
have
more
than
trebled
so
if
that
is
what
you
come
about
as
heaps
of
people
do
you
might
have
saved
yourselves
the
trouble
i
keep
the
boards
standing
just
to
let
people
know
that
the
ground
is
to
let
though
as
i
say
it
wo
be
for
another
twenty
years
when
it
be
for
the
erection
of
mansions
only
same
as
there
is
in
grosvenor
square
no
shops
or
public
houses
and
none
of
your
shanties
i
live
in
this
place
just
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
property
and
as
for
the
house
over
the
way
i
never
tried
to
let
it
and
it
never
has
been
let
not
until
a
month
ago
when
one
morning
i
had
this
letter
you
can
see
it
if
you
like
she
handed
me
a
greasy
envelope
which
she
ferreted
out
of
a
capacious
pocket
which
was
suspended
from
her
waist
and
which
she
had
to
lift
up
her
skirt
to
reach
the
envelope
was
addressed
in
unformed
characters
louisa
coleman
the
rhododendrons
convolvulus
avenue
high
oaks
park
west
kensington
i
felt
if
the
writer
had
not
been
of
a
humorous
turn
of
mind
and
drawn
on
his
imagination
and
this
really
was
the
lady
correct
address
then
there
must
be
something
in
a
name
the
letter
within
was
written
in
the
same
straggling
characterless
caligraphy
i
should
have
said
had
i
been
asked
offhand
that
the
whole
thing
was
the
composition
of
a
servant
girl
the
composition
was
about
on
a
par
with
the
writing
undersigned
would
be
oblidged
if
miss
coleman
would
let
her
emptey
house
i
do
not
know
the
rent
but
send
fifty
pounds
if
more
will
send
please
address
mohamed
el
kheir
post
office
sligo
street
london
it
struck
me
as
being
as
singular
an
application
for
a
tenancy
as
i
remembered
to
have
encountered
when
i
passed
it
on
to
lessingham
he
seemed
to
think
so
too
is
a
curious
letter
miss
coleman
i
thought
and
still
more
so
when
i
found
the
fifty
pounds
inside
there
were
five
notes
all
loose
and
the
letter
not
even
registered
if
i
had
been
asked
what
was
the
rent
of
the
house
i
should
have
said
at
the
most
not
more
than
twenty
pounds
because
between
you
and
me
it
wants
a
good
bit
of
doing
up
and
is
hardly
fit
to
live
in
as
it
stands
i
had
had
sufficient
evidence
of
the
truth
of
this
altogether
apart
from
the
landlady
frank
admission
for
all
he
could
have
done
to
help
himself
i
might
have
kept
the
money
and
only
sent
him
a
receipt
for
a
quarter
and
some
folks
would
have
done
but
i
not
one
of
that
sort
myself
and
should
care
to
be
so
i
sent
this
here
party
i
never
could
pronounce
his
name
and
never
shall
a
receipt
for
a
year
miss
coleman
paused
to
smooth
her
apron
and
consider
the
receipt
should
have
reached
this
here
party
on
the
thursday
morning
as
it
were
i
posted
it
on
the
wednesday
night
and
on
the
thursday
after
breakfast
i
thought
i
go
over
the
way
to
see
if
there
was
any
little
thing
i
could
do
because
there
was
hardly
a
whole
pane
of
glass
in
the
place
when
i
all
but
went
all
of
a
heap
when
i
looked
across
the
road
blessed
it
the
party
was
in
already
at
least
as
much
as
he
ever
was
in
which
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
never
has
been
anything
particular
though
how
he
had
got
in
unless
it
was
through
a
window
in
the
middle
of
the
night
is
more
than
i
should
care
to
say
there
was
nobody
in
the
house
when
i
went
to
bed
that
i
could
pretty
nearly
take
my
bible
oath
yet
there
was
the
blind
up
at
the
parlour
and
what
more
it
was
down
and
been
down
pretty
nearly
ever
since
well
i
says
to
myself
for
right
down
imperence
this
beats
anything
why
he
in
the
place
before
he
knows
if
i
let
him
have
it
perhaps
he
thinks
i
have
got
a
word
to
say
in
the
matter
fifty
pounds
or
no
fifty
pounds
i
soon
show
him
so
i
slips
on
my
bonnet
and
i
walks
over
the
road
and
i
hammers
at
the
door
i
have
seen
people
hammering
since
then
many
a
one
and
how
they
kept
it
up
has
puzzled
me
for
an
hour
some
of
them
but
i
was
the
first
one
as
begun
it
i
hammers
and
i
hammers
and
i
kept
on
hammering
but
it
was
no
more
use
than
if
i
been
hammering
at
a
tombstone
so
i
starts
rapping
at
the
window
but
that
was
no
use
neither
so
i
goes
round
behind
and
i
hammers
at
the
back
door
but
there
i
could
make
anyone
hear
nohow
so
i
says
to
myself
perhaps
the
party
as
is
in
ai
in
in
a
manner
of
speaking
but
i
keep
an
eye
on
the
house
and
when
he
is
in
i
take
care
that
he
ai
out
again
before
i
had
a
word
to
say
i
come
back
home
and
as
i
said
i
would
i
kept
an
eye
on
the
house
the
whole
of
that
livelong
day
but
never
a
soul
went
either
out
or
in
but
the
next
day
which
it
was
a
friday
i
got
out
of
bed
about
five
to
see
if
it
was
raining
through
my
having
an
idea
of
taking
a
little
excursion
if
the
weather
was
fine
when
i
see
a
party
coming
down
the
road
he
had
on
one
of
them
sort
of
things
and
it
was
wrapped
all
over
his
head
and
round
his
body
like
as
i
have
been
told
them
there
arabs
wear
and
indeed
i
seen
them
in
them
myself
at
west
brompton
when
they
was
in
the
exhibition
there
it
was
quite
fine
and
broad
day
and
i
see
him
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
he
comes
skimming
along
at
a
tear
of
a
pace
pulls
up
at
the
house
over
the
way
opens
the
front
door
and
lets
himself
in
so
i
says
to
myself
there
you
are
well
mr
arab
or
whatever
or
whoever
you
may
be
i
take
good
care
that
you
do
go
out
again
before
you
had
a
word
from
me
i
show
you
that
landladies
have
their
rights
like
other
christians
in
this
country
however
it
may
be
in
yours
so
i
kept
an
eye
on
the
house
to
see
that
he
did
go
out
again
and
nobody
never
did
and
between
seven
and
eight
i
goes
and
i
knocks
at
the
door
because
i
thought
to
myself
that
the
earlier
i
was
the
better
it
might
be
you
believe
me
no
more
notice
was
taken
of
me
than
if
i
was
one
of
the
dead
i
hammers
and
i
hammers
till
my
wrist
was
aching
i
daresay
i
hammered
twenty
times
and
then
i
went
round
to
the
back
door
and
i
hammers
at
that
but
it
was
the
least
good
in
the
world
i
was
that
provoked
to
think
i
should
be
treated
as
if
i
was
nothing
and
nobody
by
a
dirty
foreigner
who
went
about
in
a
through
the
public
streets
that
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
hold
myself
comes
round
to
the
front
again
and
i
starts
hammering
at
the
window
with
every
knuckle
on
my
hands
and
i
calls
out
i
miss
louisa
coleman
and
i
the
owner
of
this
house
and
you
ca
deceive
me
i
saw
you
come
in
and
you
in
now
and
if
you
do
come
and
speak
to
me
this
moment
i
have
the
police
of
a
sudden
when
i
was
least
expecting
it
and
was
hammering
my
very
hardest
at
the
pane
up
goes
the
blind
and
up
goes
the
window
too
and
the
most
creature
ever
i
heard
of
not
to
mention
seeing
puts
his
head
right
into
my
face
he
was
more
like
a
hideous
baboon
than
anything
else
let
alone
a
man
i
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
and
plumps
down
on
the
little
wall
and
all
but
tumbles
head
over
heels
backwards
and
he
starts
shrieking
in
a
sort
of
a
kind
of
english
and
in
such
a
voice
as
i
never
heard
the
like
it
was
like
a
rusty
steam
engine
go
away
go
away
i
do
want
you
i
will
not
have
you
never
you
have
your
fifty
pounds
you
have
your
money
that
is
the
whole
of
you
that
is
all
you
want
you
come
to
me
no
more
never
never
no
more
or
you
be
sorry
go
away
did
go
away
and
that
as
fast
as
ever
my
legs
would
carry
me
what
with
his
looks
and
what
with
his
voice
and
what
with
the
way
that
he
went
on
i
was
nothing
but
a
mass
of
trembling
as
for
answering
him
back
or
giving
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
as
i
had
meant
to
i
have
done
it
not
for
a
thousand
pounds
i
do
mind
confessing
between
you
and
me
that
i
had
to
swallow
four
cups
of
tea
right
straight
away
before
my
nerves
was
steady
well
i
says
to
myself
when
i
did
feel
as
it
might
be
a
little
more
easy
you
never
have
let
that
house
before
and
now
you
let
it
with
a
vengeance
so
you
have
if
that
there
new
tenant
of
yours
the
greatest
villain
that
ever
went
unhung
it
must
be
because
he
got
near
relations
what
as
bad
as
himself
because
two
families
like
his
i
sure
there
ca
be
a
nice
sort
of
arab
party
to
have
sleeping
over
the
road
he
is
after
a
time
i
cools
down
as
it
were
because
i
one
of
them
sort
as
likes
to
see
on
both
sides
of
a
question
after
all
i
says
to
myself
he
has
paid
his
rent
and
fifty
pounds
is
fifty
pounds
i
doubt
if
the
whole
house
is
worth
much
more
and
he
ca
do
much
damage
to
it
whatever
he
does
should
have
minded
so
far
as
that
went
if
he
set
fire
to
the
place
for
between
ourselves
it
insured
for
a
good
bit
over
its
value
so
i
decided
that
i
let
things
be
as
they
were
and
see
how
they
went
on
but
from
that
hour
to
this
i
never
spoken
to
the
man
and
never
wanted
to
and
would
not
of
my
own
free
will
not
for
a
shilling
a
time
that
face
of
his
will
haunt
me
if
i
live
till
noah
as
the
saying
is
i
seen
him
going
in
and
out
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
that
arab
party
a
mystery
if
ever
there
was
one
he
always
goes
tearing
along
as
if
he
flying
for
his
life
lots
of
people
have
come
to
the
house
all
sorts
and
kinds
men
and
women
they
been
mostly
women
and
even
little
children
i
seen
them
hammer
and
hammer
at
that
front
door
but
never
a
one
have
i
seen
let
in
or
yet
seen
taken
any
notice
of
and
i
think
i
may
say
and
yet
tell
no
lie
that
i
scarcely
took
my
eye
off
the
house
since
he
been
inside
it
over
and
over
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
have
i
got
up
to
have
a
look
so
that
i
not
missed
much
that
has
took
place
puzzled
me
is
the
noises
that
come
from
the
house
sometimes
for
days
together
there
not
been
a
sound
it
might
have
been
a
house
of
the
dead
and
then
all
through
the
night
there
been
yells
and
screeches
squawks
and
screams
i
never
heard
nothing
like
it
i
have
thought
and
more
than
once
that
the
devil
himself
must
be
in
that
front
room
let
alone
all
the
rest
of
his
demons
and
as
for
cats
where
they
come
from
i
ca
think
i
did
use
to
notice
hardly
a
cat
in
the
neighbourhood
till
that
there
arab
party
came
there
is
much
to
attract
them
but
since
he
came
there
been
regiments
sometimes
at
night
there
been
troops
about
the
place
screeching
like
mad
i
wished
them
farther
i
can
tell
you
that
arab
party
must
be
fond
of
i
seen
them
inside
the
house
at
the
windows
upstairs
and
downstairs
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
dozen
at
a
time
chapter
xl
what
miss
coleman
saw
through
the
window
as
miss
coleman
had
paused
as
if
her
narrative
was
approaching
a
conclusion
i
judged
it
expedient
to
make
an
attempt
to
bring
the
record
as
quickly
as
possible
up
to
date
take
it
miss
coleman
that
you
have
observed
what
has
occurred
in
the
house
she
tightened
her
jaws
and
glared
at
me
disdainfully
her
dignity
was
ruffled
coming
to
it
are
i
if
you
let
me
if
you
got
no
manners
i
learn
you
some
one
does
like
to
be
hurried
at
my
time
of
life
young
man
i
was
meekly
silent
plainly
if
she
was
to
talk
every
one
else
must
listen
the
last
few
days
there
have
been
some
queer
goings
on
over
the
road
out
of
the
common
queer
i
mean
for
goodness
knows
that
they
always
have
been
queer
enough
that
arab
party
has
been
flitting
about
like
a
creature
possessed
i
seen
him
going
in
and
out
twenty
times
a
day
this
morning
she
paused
to
fix
her
eyes
on
lessingham
she
apparently
observed
his
growing
interest
as
she
approached
the
subject
which
had
brought
us
there
and
resented
it
look
at
me
like
that
young
man
because
i
wo
have
it
and
as
for
questions
i
may
answer
questions
when
i
done
but
do
you
dare
to
ask
me
one
before
because
i
wo
be
interrupted
up
to
then
lessingham
had
not
spoken
a
word
but
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
perceiving
the
huge
volume
of
the
words
which
he
had
left
unuttered
morning
as
i
said
already
she
glanced
at
lessingham
as
if
she
defied
his
contradiction
that
arab
party
came
home
it
was
just
on
the
stroke
of
seven
i
know
what
was
the
exact
time
because
when
i
went
to
the
door
to
the
milkman
my
clock
was
striking
the
half
hour
and
i
always
keep
it
thirty
minutes
fast
as
i
was
taking
the
milk
the
man
said
to
me
hollo
miss
coleman
here
your
friend
coming
along
what
friend
i
says
for
i
ai
got
no
friends
as
i
know
round
here
nor
yet
i
hope
no
enemies
neither
i
looks
round
and
there
was
the
arab
party
coming
tearing
down
the
road
his
bedcover
thing
all
flying
in
the
wind
and
his
arms
straight
out
in
front
of
him
i
never
did
see
anyone
go
at
such
a
pace
my
goodness
i
says
i
wonder
he
do
do
himself
an
injury
i
wonder
someone
else
do
do
him
an
injury
says
the
milkman
the
very
sight
of
him
is
enough
to
make
my
milk
go
sour
and
he
picked
up
his
pail
and
went
away
quite
grumpy
though
what
that
arab
done
to
him
is
more
than
i
can
i
have
always
noticed
that
milkman
temper
short
like
his
measure
i
was
best
pleased
with
him
for
speaking
of
that
arab
party
as
my
friend
which
he
never
has
been
and
never
wo
be
and
never
could
be
neither
persons
went
to
the
house
after
the
milkman
was
gone
and
that
there
arab
party
was
safe
inside
three
of
them
was
commercials
that
i
know
because
afterwards
they
came
to
me
but
of
course
they
none
of
them
got
no
chance
with
that
there
arab
party
except
of
hammering
at
his
front
door
which
ai
what
you
might
call
a
paying
game
nor
nice
for
the
temper
but
for
that
i
do
blame
him
for
if
once
those
commercials
do
begin
talking
they
talk
for
ever
i
coming
to
this
afternoon
i
thought
it
was
about
time
though
for
the
life
of
me
i
did
not
dare
to
hint
as
much
it
might
have
been
three
or
it
might
have
been
half
past
anyhow
it
was
thereabouts
when
up
there
comes
two
men
and
a
woman
which
one
of
the
men
was
that
young
man
what
a
friend
of
yours
oh
i
says
to
myself
here
something
new
in
callers
i
wonder
what
it
is
they
wanting
that
young
man
what
was
a
friend
of
yours
he
starts
hammering
and
hammering
as
the
custom
was
with
every
one
who
came
and
as
usual
no
more
notice
was
taken
of
him
than
nothing
though
i
knew
that
all
the
time
the
arab
party
was
indoors
at
this
point
i
felt
that
at
all
hazards
i
must
interpose
a
question
are
sure
he
was
indoors
she
took
it
better
than
i
feared
she
might
course
i
sure
had
i
seen
him
come
in
at
seven
and
he
never
had
gone
out
since
for
i
do
believe
that
i
taken
my
eyes
off
the
place
not
for
two
minutes
together
and
i
never
had
a
sight
of
him
if
he
was
indoors
where
was
he
then
for
the
moment
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
query
was
unanswerable
she
triumphantly
continued
of
doing
what
most
did
when
they
had
enough
of
hammering
and
going
away
these
three
they
went
round
to
the
back
and
blessed
if
they
must
have
got
through
the
kitchen
window
woman
and
all
for
all
of
a
sudden
the
blind
in
the
front
room
was
pulled
not
up
but
down
dragged
down
it
was
and
there
was
that
young
man
what
a
friend
of
yours
standing
with
it
in
his
hand
well
i
says
to
myself
if
that
ai
cool
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
if
when
you
ai
let
in
you
can
let
yourself
in
and
that
without
so
much
as
saying
by
your
leave
or
with
your
leave
things
is
coming
to
a
pretty
pass
wherever
can
that
arab
party
be
and
whatever
can
he
be
thinking
of
to
let
them
go
on
like
that
because
that
the
sort
to
allow
a
liberty
to
be
took
with
him
and
say
nothing
i
do
believe
moment
i
expects
to
hear
a
noise
and
see
a
row
begin
but
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
all
was
quiet
and
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
so
i
says
to
myself
there
more
in
this
than
meets
the
eye
and
them
three
parties
must
have
right
upon
their
side
or
they
would
be
doing
what
they
are
doing
in
the
way
they
are
there
be
a
shindy
in
about
five
minutes
the
front
door
opens
and
a
young
man
not
the
one
what
your
friend
but
the
other
comes
sailing
out
and
through
the
gate
and
down
the
road
as
stiff
and
upright
as
a
grenadier
i
never
see
anyone
walk
more
upright
and
few
as
fast
at
his
heels
comes
the
young
man
what
is
your
friend
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
could
make
out
what
this
other
was
of
i
says
to
myself
there
been
a
quarrel
between
them
two
and
him
as
has
gone
has
hooked
it
this
young
man
what
is
your
friend
he
stood
at
the
gate
all
of
a
fidget
staring
after
the
other
with
all
his
eyes
as
if
he
could
think
what
to
make
of
him
and
the
young
woman
she
stood
on
the
doorstep
staring
after
him
too
the
young
man
what
had
hooked
it
turned
the
corner
and
was
out
of
sight
all
at
once
your
friend
he
seemed
to
make
up
his
mind
and
he
started
off
running
as
hard
as
he
could
pelt
and
the
young
woman
was
left
alone
i
expected
every
minute
to
see
him
come
back
with
the
other
young
man
and
the
young
woman
by
the
way
she
hung
about
the
gate
she
seemed
to
expect
it
too
but
no
nothing
of
the
kind
so
when
as
i
expect
she
had
enough
of
waiting
she
went
into
the
house
again
and
i
see
her
pass
the
front
room
window
after
a
while
back
she
comes
to
the
gate
and
stands
looking
and
looking
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
either
of
them
young
men
when
she
been
at
the
gate
i
daresay
five
minutes
back
she
goes
into
the
house
and
i
never
saw
nothing
of
her
again
never
saw
anything
of
her
again
are
you
sure
she
went
back
into
the
house
sure
as
i
am
that
i
see
you
suppose
that
you
did
keep
a
constant
watch
upon
the
premises
that
just
what
i
did
do
i
felt
something
queer
was
going
on
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
see
it
through
and
when
i
make
up
my
mind
to
a
thing
like
that
i
not
easy
to
turn
aside
i
never
moved
off
the
chair
at
my
bedroom
window
and
i
never
took
my
eyes
off
the
house
not
till
you
come
knocking
at
my
front
door
since
the
young
lady
is
certainly
not
in
the
house
at
present
she
must
have
eluded
your
observation
and
in
some
manner
have
left
it
without
your
seeing
her
do
believe
she
did
i
do
see
how
she
could
have
done
something
queer
about
that
house
since
that
arab
party
been
inside
it
but
though
i
did
see
her
i
did
see
someone
else
was
that
young
man
young
man
a
young
man
and
that
what
puzzled
me
and
what
been
puzzling
me
ever
since
for
see
him
go
in
i
never
did
do
you
describe
him
as
to
the
face
for
he
wore
a
dirty
cloth
cap
pulled
down
right
over
it
and
he
walked
so
quickly
that
i
never
had
a
proper
look
but
i
should
know
him
anywhere
if
i
saw
him
if
only
because
of
his
clothes
and
his
walk
was
there
peculiar
about
his
clothes
and
his
walk
his
clothes
were
that
old
and
torn
and
dirty
that
a
ragman
would
have
given
a
thank
you
for
them
and
as
for
fit
there
was
none
they
hung
upon
him
like
a
scarecrow
he
was
a
regular
figure
of
fun
i
should
think
the
boys
would
call
after
him
if
they
saw
him
in
the
street
as
for
his
walk
he
walked
off
just
like
the
first
young
man
had
done
he
strutted
along
with
his
shoulders
back
and
his
head
in
the
air
and
that
stiff
and
straight
that
my
kitchen
poker
would
have
looked
crooked
beside
of
him
nothing
happen
to
attract
your
attention
between
the
young
going
back
into
the
house
and
the
coming
out
of
this
young
man
miss
coleman
cogitated
you
mention
it
there
did
though
i
should
have
forgotten
all
about
it
if
you
had
asked
me
that
comes
of
your
not
letting
me
tell
the
tale
in
my
own
way
about
twenty
minutes
after
the
young
woman
had
gone
in
someone
put
up
the
blind
in
the
front
room
which
that
young
man
had
dragged
right
down
i
could
see
who
it
was
for
the
blind
was
between
us
and
it
was
about
ten
minutes
after
that
that
young
man
came
marching
out
then
what
followed
in
about
another
ten
minutes
that
arab
party
himself
comes
scooting
through
the
door
arab
party
the
arab
party
the
sight
of
him
took
me
clean
aback
where
been
and
what
he
been
doing
with
himself
while
them
there
people
played
about
his
premises
i
have
given
a
shilling
out
of
my
pocket
to
have
known
but
there
he
was
as
large
as
life
and
carrying
a
bundle
bundle
bundle
on
his
head
like
a
carries
his
tray
it
was
a
great
thing
you
never
would
have
thought
he
could
have
carried
it
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
manage
it
bent
him
nearly
double
and
he
went
crawling
along
like
a
snail
it
took
him
quite
a
time
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
road
mr
lessingham
leaped
up
from
his
seat
crying
was
in
that
bundle
doubt
it
i
said
he
moved
about
the
room
distractedly
wringing
his
hands
was
she
must
have
been
god
help
us
all
repeat
that
i
doubt
it
if
you
will
be
advised
by
me
you
will
wait
awhile
before
you
arrive
at
any
such
conclusion
all
at
once
there
was
a
tapping
at
the
window
pane
atherton
was
staring
at
us
from
without
he
shouted
through
the
glass
out
of
that
you
fossils
news
for
you
chapter
xli
the
constable
his
clue
and
the
cab
miss
coleman
getting
up
in
a
fluster
went
hurrying
to
the
door
wo
have
that
young
man
in
my
house
i
wo
have
him
do
let
him
dare
to
put
his
nose
across
my
doorstep
i
endeavoured
to
appease
her
perturbation
promise
you
that
he
shall
not
come
in
miss
coleman
my
friend
here
and
i
will
go
and
speak
to
him
outside
she
held
the
front
door
open
just
wide
enough
to
enable
lessingham
and
me
to
slip
through
then
she
shut
it
after
us
with
a
bang
she
evidently
had
a
strong
objection
to
any
intrusion
on
sydney
part
standing
just
without
the
gate
he
saluted
us
with
a
characteristic
vigour
which
was
scarcely
flattering
to
our
late
hostess
behind
him
was
a
constable
hope
you
two
have
been
mewed
in
with
that
old
pussy
long
enough
while
you
been
i
been
doing
listen
to
what
this
bobby
got
to
say
the
constable
his
thumbs
thrust
inside
his
belt
wore
an
indulgent
smile
upon
his
countenance
he
seemed
to
find
sydney
amusing
he
spoke
in
a
deep
bass
voice
as
if
it
issued
from
his
boots
do
know
that
i
got
anything
to
say
it
was
plain
that
sydney
thought
otherwise
wait
till
i
given
this
pretty
pair
of
gossips
a
lead
officer
then
i
trot
you
out
he
turned
to
us
i
poked
my
nose
into
every
dashed
hole
in
that
infernal
den
and
been
rewarded
with
nothing
but
a
pain
in
the
back
for
my
trouble
i
stood
cooling
my
heels
on
the
doorstep
wondering
if
i
should
fight
the
cabman
or
get
him
to
fight
me
just
to
pass
the
time
away
for
he
says
he
can
box
and
he
looks
it
when
who
should
come
strolling
along
but
this
magnificent
example
of
the
metropolitan
constabulary
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
policeman
whose
grin
grew
wider
looked
at
him
and
he
looked
at
me
and
then
when
we
had
enough
of
admiring
each
other
fine
features
and
striking
proportions
he
said
to
me
has
he
gone
i
said
who
baxter
or
bob
brown
he
said
no
the
arab
i
said
what
do
you
know
about
any
arab
he
said
well
i
saw
him
in
the
broadway
about
of
an
hour
ago
and
then
seeing
you
here
and
the
house
all
open
i
wondered
if
he
had
gone
for
good
with
that
i
almost
jumped
out
of
my
skin
though
you
can
bet
your
life
i
never
showed
it
i
said
how
do
you
know
it
was
he
he
said
it
was
him
right
enough
there
no
doubt
about
that
if
seen
him
once
you
not
likely
to
forget
him
where
was
he
going
he
was
talking
to
a
cabman
he
got
a
great
bundle
on
his
head
wanted
to
take
it
inside
with
him
cabman
did
seem
to
see
it
that
was
enough
for
me
i
picked
this
most
deserving
officer
up
in
my
arms
and
carried
him
across
the
road
to
you
two
fellows
like
a
flash
of
lightning
since
the
policeman
was
six
feet
three
or
four
and
more
than
sufficiently
broad
in
proportion
his
scarcely
seemed
the
kind
of
figure
to
be
picked
up
in
anybody
arms
and
carried
like
a
of
lightning
which
as
his
smile
grew
more
indulgent
he
himself
appeared
to
think
still
even
allowing
for
atherton
exaggeration
the
news
which
he
had
brought
was
sufficiently
important
i
questioned
the
constable
upon
my
own
account
is
my
card
officer
probably
before
the
day
is
over
a
charge
of
a
very
serious
character
will
be
preferred
against
the
person
who
has
been
residing
in
the
house
over
the
way
in
the
meantime
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
a
watch
should
be
kept
upon
his
movements
i
suppose
you
have
no
sort
of
doubt
that
the
person
you
saw
in
the
broadway
was
the
one
in
question
a
morsel
i
know
him
as
well
as
i
do
my
own
brother
we
all
do
upon
this
beat
he
known
amongst
us
as
the
arab
i
had
my
eye
on
him
ever
since
he
came
to
the
place
a
queer
fish
he
is
i
always
have
said
that
he
up
to
some
game
or
other
i
never
came
across
one
like
him
for
flying
about
in
all
sorts
of
weather
at
all
hours
of
the
night
always
tearing
along
as
if
for
his
life
as
i
was
telling
this
gentleman
i
saw
him
in
the
broadway
well
now
it
about
an
hour
since
perhaps
a
little
more
i
was
coming
on
duty
when
i
saw
a
crowd
in
front
of
the
district
railway
station
and
there
was
the
arab
having
a
sort
of
argument
with
the
cabman
he
had
a
great
bundle
on
his
head
five
or
six
feet
long
perhaps
longer
he
wanted
to
take
this
great
bundle
with
him
into
the
cab
and
the
cabman
he
did
see
it
did
wait
to
see
him
drive
off
i
had
time
i
was
due
at
the
station
i
was
cutting
it
pretty
fine
as
it
was
did
speak
to
him
or
to
the
cabman
it
was
any
business
of
mine
you
understand
the
whole
thing
just
caught
my
eye
as
i
was
passing
you
did
take
the
cabman
number
well
as
far
as
that
goes
it
was
needful
i
know
the
cabman
his
name
and
all
about
him
his
stable
in
bradmore
i
whipped
out
my
me
his
address
do
know
what
his
christian
name
is
tom
i
believe
but
i
not
sure
anyhow
his
surname
ellis
and
his
address
is
church
mews
st
john
road
bradmore
i
do
know
his
number
but
any
one
will
tell
you
which
is
his
place
if
you
ask
for
ellis
that
the
name
he
known
by
among
his
pals
because
of
his
driving
a
you
officer
i
am
obliged
to
you
two
changed
hands
you
will
keep
an
eye
on
the
house
and
advise
me
at
the
address
which
you
will
find
on
my
card
of
any
thing
which
takes
place
there
during
the
next
few
days
you
will
do
me
a
service
we
had
clambered
back
into
the
hansom
the
driver
was
just
about
to
start
when
the
constable
was
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
moment
sir
blessed
if
i
was
going
to
forget
the
most
important
bit
of
all
i
did
hear
him
tell
ellis
where
to
drive
him
to
he
kept
saying
it
over
and
over
again
in
that
queer
lingo
of
his
waterloo
railway
station
waterloo
railway
station
all
right
said
ellis
i
drive
you
to
waterloo
railway
station
right
enough
only
i
not
going
to
have
that
bundle
of
yours
inside
my
cab
there
room
for
it
so
you
put
it
on
the
roof
to
waterloo
railway
station
said
the
arab
i
take
my
bundle
with
me
to
waterloo
railway
station
i
take
it
with
me
who
says
you
do
take
it
with
you
said
ellis
you
can
take
it
and
twenty
more
besides
for
all
i
care
only
you
do
take
it
inside
my
cab
put
it
on
the
roof
i
take
it
with
me
to
waterloo
railway
station
said
the
arab
and
there
they
were
wrangling
and
jangling
and
neither
seeming
to
be
able
to
make
out
what
the
other
was
after
and
the
people
all
laughing
railway
station
you
are
sure
that
was
what
he
said
take
my
oath
to
it
because
i
said
to
myself
when
i
heard
it
i
wonder
what
you
have
to
pay
for
that
little
lot
for
the
district
railway
station
outside
the
radius
as
we
drove
off
i
was
inclined
to
ask
myself
a
little
bitterly
and
perhaps
unjustly
if
it
were
not
characteristic
of
the
average
london
policeman
to
almost
forget
the
most
important
part
of
his
information
at
any
rate
to
leave
it
to
the
last
and
only
to
bring
it
to
the
front
on
having
his
palm
crossed
with
silver
as
the
hansom
bowled
along
we
three
had
what
occasionally
approached
a
warm
discussion
was
in
that
bundle
began
lessingham
in
the
most
lugubrious
of
tones
and
with
the
most
of
faces
doubt
it
i
observed
was
i
feel
it
i
know
it
she
was
either
dead
and
mutilated
or
gagged
and
drugged
and
helpless
all
that
remains
is
vengeance
repeat
that
i
doubt
it
atherton
struck
in
am
bound
to
say
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
to
think
otherwise
that
i
agree
with
lessingham
are
wrong
all
very
well
for
you
to
talk
in
that
way
but
easier
for
you
to
say
i
wrong
than
to
prove
it
if
i
am
wrong
and
if
lessingham
wrong
how
do
you
explain
his
extraordinary
insistance
on
taking
it
inside
the
cab
with
him
which
the
bobby
describes
if
there
was
something
horrible
awful
in
that
bundle
of
his
of
which
he
feared
the
discovery
why
was
he
so
reluctant
to
have
it
placed
upon
the
roof
probably
was
something
in
it
which
he
was
particularly
anxious
should
not
be
discovered
but
i
doubt
if
it
was
anything
of
the
kind
which
you
suggest
is
marjorie
in
a
house
alone
nothing
has
been
seen
of
her
since
her
clothing
her
hair
is
found
hidden
away
under
the
floor
this
scoundrel
sallies
forth
with
a
huge
bundle
on
his
head
the
bobby
speaks
of
it
being
five
or
six
feet
long
or
longer
a
bundle
which
he
regards
with
so
much
solicitude
that
he
insists
on
never
allowing
it
to
go
for
a
single
instant
out
of
his
sight
and
reach
what
is
in
the
thing
do
all
the
facts
most
unfortunately
point
in
one
direction
mr
lessingham
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
groaned
fear
that
mr
atherton
is
right
differ
from
you
both
sydney
at
once
became
heated
perhaps
you
can
tell
us
what
was
in
the
bundle
fancy
i
could
make
a
guess
at
the
contents
you
could
could
you
then
perhaps
for
our
sakes
you
make
it
and
not
play
the
oracular
owl
lessingham
and
i
are
interested
in
this
business
after
all
contained
the
bearer
personal
property
that
and
nothing
more
stay
before
you
jeer
at
me
suffer
me
to
finish
if
i
am
not
mistaken
as
to
the
identity
of
the
person
whom
the
constable
describes
as
the
arab
i
apprehend
that
the
contents
of
that
bundle
were
of
much
more
importance
to
him
than
if
they
had
consisted
of
miss
lindon
either
dead
or
living
more
i
am
inclined
to
suspect
that
if
the
bundle
was
placed
on
the
roof
of
the
cab
and
if
the
driver
did
meddle
with
it
and
did
find
out
the
contents
and
understand
them
he
would
have
been
driven
out
of
hand
stark
staring
mad
sydney
was
silent
as
if
he
reflected
i
imagine
he
perceived
there
was
something
in
what
i
said
what
has
become
of
miss
lindon
fancy
that
miss
lindon
at
this
moment
is
somewhere
i
do
just
now
know
exactly
where
but
i
hope
very
shortly
to
be
able
to
give
you
a
clearer
notion
attired
in
a
rotten
dirty
pair
of
boots
a
filthy
tattered
pair
of
trousers
a
ragged
unwashed
apology
for
a
shirt
a
greasy
ancient
shapeless
coat
and
a
frowsy
peaked
cloth
cap
they
stared
at
me
atherton
was
the
first
to
speak
on
earth
do
you
mean
mean
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
facts
point
in
the
direction
of
my
conclusions
rather
than
yours
and
that
very
strongly
too
miss
coleman
asserts
that
she
saw
miss
london
return
into
the
house
that
within
a
few
minutes
the
blind
was
replaced
at
the
front
window
and
that
shortly
after
a
young
man
attired
in
the
costume
i
have
described
came
walking
out
of
the
front
door
i
believe
that
young
man
was
miss
marjorie
lindon
lessingham
and
atherton
both
broke
out
into
interrogations
with
sydney
as
usual
loudest
man
alive
what
on
earth
should
make
her
do
a
thing
like
that
marjorie
the
most
retiring
modest
girl
on
all
god
earth
walk
about
in
broad
daylight
in
such
a
costume
and
for
no
reason
at
all
my
dear
champnell
you
are
suggesting
that
she
first
of
all
went
mad
was
in
a
state
of
trance
god
champnell
you
think
that
juggling
villain
did
get
hold
of
her
here
is
my
view
of
the
case
mind
it
is
only
a
hypothesis
and
you
must
take
it
for
what
it
is
worth
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
the
arab
as
we
will
call
the
person
for
the
sake
of
identification
was
somewhere
about
the
premises
when
you
thought
he
was
where
we
looked
upstairs
and
downstairs
and
everywhere
where
could
he
have
been
as
at
present
advised
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
but
i
think
you
may
take
it
for
granted
that
he
was
there
he
hypnotised
the
man
holt
and
sent
him
away
intending
you
to
go
after
him
and
so
being
rid
of
you
both
deuce
he
did
champnell
you
write
me
down
an
ass
soon
as
the
coast
was
clear
he
discovered
himself
to
miss
lindon
who
i
expect
was
disagreeably
surprised
and
hypnotised
her
hound
devil
the
first
exclamation
was
lessingham
the
second
sydney
then
constrained
her
to
strip
herself
to
the
skin
wretch
fiend
cut
off
her
hair
he
hid
it
and
her
clothes
under
the
floor
where
we
found
them
where
i
think
it
probable
that
he
had
already
some
ancient
masculine
garments
concealed
jove
i
should
be
surprised
if
they
were
holt
i
remember
the
man
saying
that
that
nice
joker
stripped
him
of
his
duds
and
certainly
when
i
saw
him
and
when
marjorie
found
him
he
had
absolutely
nothing
on
but
a
queer
sort
of
cloak
can
it
be
possible
that
that
humorous
professor
of
may
all
the
maledictions
of
the
accursed
alight
upon
his
head
can
have
sent
marjorie
lindon
the
daintiest
damsel
in
the
land
into
the
streets
of
london
rigged
out
in
holt
old
togs
to
that
i
am
not
able
to
give
an
authoritative
opinion
but
if
i
understand
you
aright
it
at
least
is
possible
anyhow
i
am
disposed
to
think
that
he
sent
miss
lindon
after
the
man
holt
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
had
eluded
it
write
me
down
an
ass
again
he
did
elude
you
you
have
yourself
admitted
because
i
stopped
talking
with
that
bobby
have
followed
the
man
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
if
it
had
been
for
that
the
reason
is
immaterial
it
is
the
fact
with
which
we
are
immediately
concerned
he
did
elude
you
and
i
think
you
will
find
that
miss
lindon
and
mr
holt
are
together
at
this
moment
men
clothing
in
men
clothing
or
rather
miss
lindon
is
in
a
man
rags
potiphar
to
think
of
marjorie
like
that
where
they
are
the
arab
is
not
very
far
off
either
lessingham
caught
me
by
the
arm
what
diabolical
mischief
do
you
imagine
that
he
proposes
to
do
to
her
i
shirked
the
question
it
is
it
is
our
business
to
prevent
his
doing
it
where
do
you
think
they
have
been
taken
it
will
be
our
immediate
business
to
endeavour
to
discover
and
here
at
any
rate
we
are
at
waterloo
chapter
xlii
the
quarry
doubles
i
turned
towards
the
on
the
main
departure
platform
as
i
went
the
chief
platform
inspector
george
bellingham
with
whom
i
had
some
acquaintance
came
out
of
his
office
i
stopped
him
bellingham
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
step
with
me
to
the
and
instruct
the
clerk
in
charge
to
answer
one
or
two
questions
which
i
wish
to
put
to
him
i
will
explain
to
you
afterwards
what
is
their
exact
import
but
you
know
me
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
believe
me
when
i
say
that
they
refer
to
a
matter
in
which
every
moment
is
of
the
first
importance
he
turned
and
accompanied
us
into
the
interior
of
the
which
of
the
clerks
mr
champnell
do
you
wish
to
put
your
questions
the
one
who
issues
tickets
to
southampton
bellingham
beckoned
to
a
man
who
was
counting
a
heap
of
money
and
apparently
seeking
to
make
it
tally
with
the
entries
in
a
huge
ledger
which
lay
open
before
him
he
was
a
short
young
fellow
with
a
pleasant
face
and
smiling
eyes
stone
this
gentleman
wishes
to
ask
you
one
or
two
questions
am
at
his
service
i
put
my
questions
want
to
know
mr
stone
if
in
the
course
of
the
day
you
have
issued
any
tickets
to
a
person
dressed
in
arab
costume
his
reply
was
prompt
have
by
the
last
train
the
three
singles
three
singles
then
my
instinct
had
told
me
rightly
you
describe
the
person
mr
stone
eyes
twinkled
do
know
that
i
can
except
in
a
general
way
he
was
uncommonly
old
and
uncommonly
ugly
and
he
had
a
pair
of
the
most
extraordinary
eyes
i
ever
saw
they
gave
me
a
sort
of
feeling
when
i
saw
them
glaring
at
me
through
the
pigeon
hole
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
about
him
he
had
a
great
bundle
on
his
head
which
he
steadied
with
one
hand
and
as
it
bulged
out
in
all
directions
it
presence
did
make
him
popular
with
other
people
who
wanted
tickets
too
undoubtedly
this
was
our
man
are
sure
he
asked
for
three
tickets
he
said
three
tickets
to
southampton
laid
down
the
exact
fare
nineteen
and
six
and
held
up
three
fingers
like
that
three
nasty
looking
fingers
they
were
with
nails
as
long
as
talons
did
see
who
were
his
companions
did
i
did
try
to
look
i
gave
him
his
tickets
and
off
he
went
with
the
people
grumbling
at
him
because
that
bundle
of
his
kept
getting
in
their
way
bellingham
touched
me
on
the
arm
can
tell
you
about
the
arab
of
whom
mr
stone
speaks
my
attention
was
called
to
him
by
his
insisting
on
taking
his
bundle
with
him
into
the
carriage
it
was
an
enormous
thing
he
could
hardly
squeeze
it
through
the
door
it
occupied
the
entire
seat
but
as
there
were
as
many
passengers
as
usual
and
he
would
or
could
be
made
to
understand
that
his
precious
bundle
would
be
safe
in
the
luggage
van
along
with
the
rest
of
the
luggage
and
as
he
was
the
sort
of
person
you
could
argue
with
to
any
advantage
i
had
him
put
into
an
empty
compartment
bundle
and
all
he
alone
then
thought
so
at
the
time
he
said
nothing
about
having
more
than
one
ticket
or
any
companions
but
just
before
the
train
started
two
other
men
english
men
got
into
his
compartment
and
as
i
came
down
the
platform
the
ticket
inspector
at
the
barrier
informed
me
that
these
two
men
were
with
him
because
he
held
tickets
for
the
three
which
as
he
was
a
foreigner
and
they
seemed
english
struck
the
inspector
as
odd
you
describe
the
two
men
could
not
particularly
but
the
man
who
had
charge
of
the
barrier
might
i
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
train
when
they
got
in
all
i
noticed
was
that
one
seemed
to
be
a
commonplace
looking
individual
and
that
the
other
was
dressed
like
a
tramp
all
rags
and
tatters
a
disreputable
looking
object
he
appeared
to
be
i
said
to
myself
miss
marjorie
lindon
the
lovely
daughter
of
a
famous
house
the
of
a
coming
statesman
to
bellingham
i
remarked
aloud
want
you
to
strain
a
point
mr
bellingham
and
to
do
me
a
service
which
i
assure
you
you
shall
never
have
any
cause
to
regret
i
want
you
to
wire
instructions
down
the
line
to
detain
this
arab
and
his
companions
and
to
keep
them
in
custody
until
the
receipt
of
further
instructions
they
are
not
wanted
by
the
police
as
yet
but
they
will
be
as
soon
as
i
am
able
to
give
certain
information
to
the
authorities
at
scotland
yard
and
wanted
very
badly
but
as
you
will
perceive
for
yourself
until
i
am
able
to
give
that
information
every
moment
is
where
the
station
superintendent
gone
at
present
i
in
charge
will
you
do
this
for
me
i
repeat
that
you
shall
never
have
any
reason
to
regret
it
will
if
you
accept
all
responsibility
do
that
with
the
greatest
pleasure
bellingham
looked
at
his
watch
about
twenty
minutes
to
nine
the
train
scheduled
for
basingstoke
at
if
we
wire
to
basingstoke
at
once
they
ought
to
be
ready
for
them
when
they
come
the
wire
was
sent
we
were
shown
into
bellingham
office
to
await
results
lessingham
paced
agitatedly
to
and
fro
he
seemed
to
have
reached
the
limits
of
his
and
to
be
in
a
condition
in
which
movement
of
some
sort
was
an
absolute
necessity
the
mercurial
sydney
on
the
contrary
leaned
back
in
a
chair
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
trouser
pockets
and
stared
at
lessingham
as
if
he
found
relief
to
his
feelings
in
watching
his
restlessness
i
for
my
part
drew
up
as
full
a
precis
of
the
case
as
i
deemed
advisable
and
as
time
permitted
which
i
despatched
by
one
of
the
company
police
to
scotland
yard
then
i
turned
to
my
associates
gentlemen
it
past
dinner
time
we
may
have
a
journey
in
front
of
us
if
you
take
my
advice
you
have
something
to
eat
lessingham
shook
his
head
want
nothing
i
echoed
sydney
i
started
up
must
pardon
my
saying
nonsense
but
surely
you
of
all
men
mr
lessingham
should
be
aware
that
you
will
not
improve
the
situation
by
rendering
yourself
incapable
of
seeing
it
through
come
and
dine
i
haled
them
off
with
me
willy
nilly
to
the
refreshment
room
i
dined
after
a
fashion
mr
lessingham
swallowed
with
difficulty
a
plate
of
soup
sydney
nibbled
at
a
plate
of
the
most
unpromising
looking
and
ham
he
proved
indeed
more
intractable
than
lessingham
and
was
not
to
be
persuaded
to
tackle
anything
easier
of
digestion
i
was
just
about
to
take
cheese
after
chop
when
bellingham
came
hastening
in
in
his
hand
an
open
telegram
birds
have
flown
he
cried
how
in
reply
he
gave
me
the
telegram
i
glanced
at
it
it
ran
described
not
in
the
train
guard
says
they
got
out
at
vauxhall
have
wired
vauxhall
to
advise
you
a
chap
said
bellingham
man
who
sent
that
telegram
his
wiring
to
vauxhall
should
save
us
a
lot
of
time
we
ought
to
hear
from
there
directly
hollo
what
this
i
should
be
surprised
if
this
is
it
as
he
spoke
a
porter
entered
he
handed
an
envelope
to
bellingham
we
all
three
kept
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
inspector
face
as
he
opened
it
when
he
perceived
the
contents
he
gave
an
exclamation
of
surprise
arab
of
yours
and
his
two
friends
seem
rather
a
curious
lot
mr
champnell
he
passed
the
paper
on
to
me
it
took
the
form
of
a
report
lessingham
and
sydney
regardless
of
forms
and
ceremonies
leaned
over
my
shoulder
as
i
read
it
by
southampton
on
arrival
of
train
complained
of
noises
coming
from
a
compartment
in
coach
stated
that
there
had
been
shrieks
and
yells
ever
since
the
train
left
waterloo
as
if
someone
was
being
murdered
an
arab
and
two
englishmen
got
out
of
the
compartment
in
question
apparently
the
party
referred
to
in
wire
just
to
hand
from
basingstoke
all
three
declared
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
that
they
had
been
shouting
for
fun
arab
gave
up
three
third
singles
for
southampton
saying
in
reply
to
questions
that
they
had
changed
their
minds
and
did
not
want
to
go
any
farther
as
there
were
no
signs
of
a
struggle
or
of
violence
nor
apparently
any
definite
cause
for
detention
they
were
allowed
to
pass
they
took
a
no
the
arab
and
one
man
went
inside
and
the
other
man
on
the
box
they
asked
to
be
driven
to
commercial
road
limehouse
the
cab
has
since
returned
driver
says
he
put
the
three
men
down
at
their
request
in
commercial
road
at
the
corner
of
sutcliffe
street
near
the
east
india
docks
they
walked
up
sutcliffe
street
the
englishmen
in
front
and
the
arab
behind
took
the
first
turning
to
the
right
and
after
that
he
saw
nothing
of
them
the
driver
further
states
that
all
the
way
the
englishman
inside
who
was
so
ragged
and
dirty
that
he
was
reluctant
to
carry
him
kept
up
a
sort
of
wailing
noise
which
so
attracted
his
attention
that
he
twice
got
off
his
box
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
each
time
he
said
it
was
nothing
the
cabman
is
of
opinion
that
both
the
englishmen
were
of
weak
intellect
we
were
of
the
same
impression
here
they
said
nothing
except
at
the
seeming
instigation
of
the
arab
but
when
spoken
to
stared
and
gaped
like
lunatics
may
be
mentioned
that
the
arab
had
with
him
an
enormous
bundle
which
he
persisted
in
spite
of
all
remonstrances
on
taking
with
him
inside
the
cab
as
soon
as
i
had
mastered
the
contents
of
the
report
and
perceived
what
i
believed
to
be
unknown
to
the
writer
himself
its
hideous
inner
meaning
i
turned
to
bellingham
your
permission
mr
bellingham
i
will
keep
this
communication
it
will
be
safe
in
my
hands
you
will
be
able
to
get
a
copy
and
it
may
be
necessary
that
i
should
have
the
original
to
show
to
the
police
if
any
inquiries
are
made
for
me
from
scotland
yard
tell
them
that
i
have
gone
to
the
commercial
road
and
that
i
will
report
my
movements
from
limehouse
police
station
in
another
minute
we
were
once
more
traversing
the
streets
of
london
three
in
a
hansom
cab
chapter
xliii
the
murder
at
mrs
it
is
something
of
a
drive
from
waterloo
to
limehouse
it
seems
longer
when
all
your
nerves
are
tingling
with
anxiety
to
reach
your
end
and
the
cab
i
had
hit
upon
proved
to
be
not
the
fastest
i
might
have
chosen
for
some
time
after
our
start
we
were
silent
each
was
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
then
lessingham
who
was
sitting
at
my
side
said
to
me
champnell
you
have
that
report
have
you
let
me
see
it
once
more
i
gave
it
to
him
he
read
it
once
twice
and
i
fancy
yet
again
i
purposely
avoided
looking
at
him
as
he
did
so
yet
all
the
while
i
was
conscious
of
his
pallid
cheeks
the
twitched
muscles
of
his
mouth
the
feverish
glitter
of
his
eyes
this
leader
of
men
whose
predominate
characteristic
in
the
house
of
commons
was
immobility
was
rapidly
approximating
to
the
condition
of
a
hysterical
woman
the
mental
strain
which
he
had
been
recently
undergoing
was
proving
too
much
for
his
physical
strength
this
disappearance
of
the
woman
he
loved
bade
fair
to
be
the
final
straw
i
felt
convinced
that
unless
something
was
done
quickly
to
relieve
the
strain
upon
his
mind
he
was
nearer
to
a
state
of
complete
mental
and
moral
collapse
than
he
himself
imagined
had
he
been
under
my
orders
i
should
have
commanded
him
to
at
once
return
home
and
not
to
think
but
conscious
that
as
things
were
such
a
direction
would
be
simply
futile
i
decided
to
do
something
else
instead
feeling
that
suspense
was
for
him
the
worst
possible
form
of
suffering
i
resolved
to
explain
so
far
as
i
was
able
precisely
what
it
was
i
feared
and
how
i
proposed
to
prevent
it
presently
there
came
the
question
for
which
i
had
been
waiting
in
a
harsh
broken
voice
which
no
one
who
had
heard
him
speak
on
a
public
platform
or
in
the
house
of
commons
would
have
recognised
as
his
champnell
who
do
you
think
this
person
is
of
whom
the
report
from
vauxhall
station
speaks
as
being
all
in
rags
and
tatters
he
knew
perfectly
well
but
i
understood
the
mental
attitude
which
induced
him
to
prefer
that
the
information
should
seem
to
come
from
me
hope
that
it
will
prove
to
be
miss
lindon
he
gave
a
sort
of
gasp
hope
because
if
it
is
i
think
it
possible
nay
probable
that
within
a
few
hours
you
will
have
her
again
enfolded
in
your
arms
god
that
it
may
be
so
pray
god
pray
the
good
god
i
did
not
dare
to
look
round
for
from
the
tremor
which
was
in
his
tone
i
was
persuaded
that
in
the
speaker
eyes
were
tears
atherton
continued
silent
he
was
leaning
half
out
of
the
cab
staring
straight
ahead
as
if
he
saw
in
front
a
young
girl
face
from
which
he
could
not
remove
his
glance
and
which
beckoned
him
on
after
a
while
lessingham
spoke
again
as
if
half
to
himself
and
half
to
me
mention
of
the
shrieks
on
the
railway
and
of
the
wailing
noise
in
the
cab
what
must
this
wretch
have
done
to
her
how
my
darling
must
have
suffered
that
was
a
theme
on
which
i
myself
scarcely
ventured
to
allow
my
thoughts
to
rest
the
notion
of
a
girl
being
at
the
mercy
of
that
fiend
incarnate
possessed
as
i
believed
that
arab
to
be
possessed
of
all
the
paraphernalia
of
horror
and
of
dread
was
one
which
caused
me
tangible
shrinkings
of
the
body
whence
had
come
those
shrieks
and
yells
of
which
the
writer
of
the
report
spoke
which
had
caused
the
arab
to
think
that
murder
was
being
done
what
unimaginable
agony
had
caused
them
what
speechless
torture
and
the
noise
which
had
induced
the
prosaic
indurated
london
cabman
to
get
twice
off
his
box
to
see
what
was
the
matter
what
anguish
had
been
provocative
of
that
the
helpless
girl
who
had
already
endured
so
much
endured
perhaps
that
to
which
death
would
have
been
preferred
shut
up
in
that
rattling
jolting
box
on
wheels
alone
with
that
diabolical
asiatic
with
the
enormous
bundle
which
was
but
the
lurking
place
of
nameless
terrors
what
might
she
not
while
being
borne
through
the
heart
of
civilised
london
have
been
made
to
suffer
what
had
she
not
been
made
to
suffer
to
have
kept
up
that
continued
noise
it
was
not
a
theme
on
which
it
was
wise
to
permit
one
thoughts
to
linger
and
particularly
was
it
clear
that
it
was
one
from
which
lessingham
thoughts
should
have
been
kept
as
far
as
possible
away
mr
lessingham
neither
you
nor
i
will
do
himself
any
good
by
permitting
his
reflections
to
flow
in
a
morbid
channel
let
us
talk
of
something
else
by
the
way
were
you
due
to
speak
in
the
house
yes
i
was
due
but
what
does
it
matter
have
you
acquainted
no
one
with
the
cause
of
your
whom
should
i
acquaint
good
sir
listen
to
me
mr
lessingham
let
me
entreat
you
very
earnestly
to
follow
my
advice
call
another
cab
or
take
this
and
go
at
once
to
the
house
it
is
not
too
late
play
the
man
deliver
the
speech
you
have
undertaken
to
deliver
perform
your
political
duties
by
coming
with
me
you
will
be
a
hindrance
rather
than
a
help
and
you
may
do
your
reputation
an
injury
from
which
it
never
may
recover
do
as
i
counsel
you
and
i
will
undertake
to
do
my
very
utmost
to
let
you
have
good
news
by
the
time
your
speech
is
finished
he
turned
on
me
with
a
bitterness
for
which
i
was
unprepared
i
were
to
go
down
to
the
house
and
try
to
speak
in
the
state
in
which
i
am
now
they
would
laugh
at
me
i
should
be
ruined
you
not
run
an
equally
great
risk
of
being
ruined
by
staying
away
he
gripped
me
by
the
arm
champnell
do
you
know
that
i
am
on
the
verge
of
madness
do
you
know
that
as
i
am
sitting
here
by
your
side
i
am
living
in
a
dual
world
i
am
going
on
and
on
to
catch
that
that
fiend
and
i
am
back
again
in
that
egyptian
den
upon
that
couch
of
rugs
with
the
woman
of
the
songs
beside
me
and
marjorie
is
being
torn
and
tortured
and
burnt
before
my
eyes
god
help
me
her
shrieks
are
ringing
in
my
ears
he
did
not
speak
loudly
but
his
voice
was
none
the
less
impressive
on
that
account
i
endeavoured
my
hardest
to
be
stern
confess
that
you
disappoint
me
mr
lessingham
i
have
always
understood
that
you
were
a
man
of
unusual
strength
you
appear
instead
to
be
a
man
of
extraordinary
weakness
with
an
imagination
so
that
its
ebullitions
remind
me
of
nothing
so
much
as
feminine
hysterics
your
wild
language
is
not
warranted
by
circumstances
i
repeat
that
i
think
it
quite
possible
that
by
morning
she
will
be
returned
to
you
but
how
as
the
marjorie
i
have
known
as
i
saw
her
last
or
how
that
was
the
question
which
i
had
already
asked
myself
in
what
condition
would
she
be
when
we
had
succeeded
in
snatching
her
from
her
captor
grip
it
was
a
question
to
which
i
had
refused
to
supply
an
answer
to
him
i
lied
by
implication
us
hope
that
with
the
exception
of
being
a
trifle
scared
she
will
be
as
sound
and
hale
and
hearty
as
even
in
her
life
you
yourself
believe
that
she
be
like
that
untouched
unchanged
unstained
then
i
lied
right
out
it
seemed
to
me
necessary
to
calm
his
growing
excitement
do
do
lessingham
you
think
that
i
ca
see
your
face
and
read
in
it
the
same
thoughts
which
trouble
me
as
a
man
of
honour
do
you
care
to
deny
that
when
marjorie
lindon
is
restored
to
me
if
she
ever
is
you
fear
she
will
be
but
the
mere
soiled
husk
of
the
marjorie
whom
i
knew
and
loved
supposing
that
there
may
be
a
modicum
of
truth
in
what
you
say
which
i
am
far
from
being
disposed
to
admit
what
good
purpose
do
you
propose
to
serve
by
talking
in
such
a
strain
no
good
purpose
unless
it
be
the
desire
of
looking
the
truth
in
the
face
for
mr
champnell
you
must
not
seek
to
play
with
me
the
hypocrite
nor
try
to
hide
things
from
me
as
if
i
were
a
child
if
my
life
is
ruined
it
is
ruined
let
me
know
it
and
look
the
knowledge
in
the
face
that
to
me
is
to
play
the
man
i
was
silent
the
wild
tale
he
had
told
me
of
that
cairene
inferno
oddly
enough
yet
why
oddly
for
the
world
is
all
coincidence
had
thrown
a
flood
of
light
on
certain
events
which
had
happened
some
three
years
previously
and
which
ever
since
had
remained
shrouded
in
mystery
the
conduct
of
the
business
afterwards
came
into
my
hands
and
briefly
what
had
occurred
was
this
three
persons
two
sisters
and
their
brother
who
was
younger
than
themselves
members
of
a
decent
english
family
were
going
on
a
trip
round
the
world
they
were
young
adventurous
and
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
foolhardy
the
evening
after
their
arrival
in
cairo
by
way
of
what
is
called
lark
in
spite
of
the
protestations
of
people
who
were
better
informed
than
themselves
they
insisted
on
going
alone
for
a
ramble
through
the
native
quarter
they
went
but
they
never
returned
or
rather
the
two
girls
never
returned
after
an
interval
the
young
man
was
found
again
what
was
left
of
him
a
fuss
was
made
when
there
were
no
signs
of
their
but
as
there
were
no
relations
nor
even
friends
of
theirs
but
only
casual
acquaintances
on
board
the
ship
by
which
they
had
travelled
perhaps
not
so
great
a
fuss
as
might
have
been
was
made
anyhow
nothing
was
discovered
their
widowed
mother
alone
in
england
wondering
how
it
was
that
beyond
the
receipt
of
a
brief
wire
acquainting
her
with
their
arrival
at
cairo
she
had
heard
nothing
further
of
their
wanderings
placed
herself
in
communication
with
the
diplomatic
people
over
there
to
learn
that
to
all
appearances
her
three
children
had
vanished
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
then
a
fuss
was
made
with
a
vengeance
so
far
as
one
can
judge
the
whole
town
and
neighbourhood
was
turned
pretty
well
upside
down
but
nothing
came
of
it
so
far
as
any
results
were
concerned
the
authorities
might
just
as
well
have
left
the
mystery
of
their
vanishment
alone
it
continued
where
it
was
in
spite
of
them
however
some
three
months
afterwards
a
youth
was
brought
to
the
british
embassy
by
a
party
of
friendly
arabs
who
asserted
that
they
had
found
him
naked
and
nearly
dying
in
some
remote
spot
in
the
wady
haifa
desert
it
was
the
brother
of
the
two
lost
girls
he
was
as
nearly
dying
as
he
very
well
could
be
without
being
actually
dead
when
they
brought
him
to
the
embassy
and
in
a
state
of
indescribable
mutilation
he
seemed
to
rally
for
a
time
under
careful
treatment
but
he
never
again
uttered
a
coherent
word
it
was
only
from
his
delirious
ravings
that
any
idea
was
formed
of
what
had
really
occurred
shorthand
notes
were
taken
of
some
of
the
utterances
of
his
delirium
afterwards
they
were
submitted
to
me
i
remembered
the
substance
of
them
quite
well
and
when
mr
lessingham
began
to
tell
me
of
his
own
hideous
experiences
they
came
back
to
me
more
clearly
still
had
i
laid
those
notes
before
him
i
have
little
doubt
but
that
he
would
have
immediately
perceived
that
seventeen
years
after
the
adventure
which
had
left
such
an
indelible
scar
upon
his
own
life
this
youth
he
was
little
more
than
a
boy
had
seen
the
things
which
he
had
seen
and
suffered
the
nameless
agonies
and
degradations
which
he
had
suffered
the
young
man
was
perpetually
raving
about
some
indescribable
den
of
horror
which
was
own
brother
to
lessingham
temple
and
about
some
female
monster
whom
he
regarded
with
such
fear
and
horror
that
every
allusion
he
made
to
her
was
followed
by
a
convulsive
paroxysm
which
taxed
all
the
ingenuity
of
his
medical
attendants
to
bring
him
out
of
he
frequently
called
upon
his
sisters
by
name
speaking
of
them
in
a
manner
which
inevitably
suggested
that
he
had
been
an
unwilling
and
helpless
witness
of
hideous
tortures
which
they
had
undergone
and
then
he
would
rise
in
bed
screaming
burning
them
they
burning
them
devils
devils
and
at
those
times
it
required
all
the
strength
of
those
who
were
in
attendance
to
restrain
his
maddened
frenzy
the
youth
died
in
one
of
these
fits
of
great
preternatural
excitement
without
as
i
have
previously
written
having
given
utterance
to
one
single
coherent
word
and
by
some
of
those
who
were
best
able
to
judge
it
was
held
to
have
been
a
mercy
that
he
did
die
without
having
been
restored
to
consciousness
and
presently
tales
began
to
be
whispered
about
some
idolatrous
sect
which
was
stated
to
have
its
headquarters
somewhere
in
the
interior
of
the
country
some
located
it
in
this
neighbourhood
and
some
in
that
which
was
stated
to
still
practise
and
to
always
have
practised
in
unbroken
historical
continuity
the
debased
unclean
mystic
and
bloody
rites
of
a
form
of
idolatry
which
had
had
its
birth
in
a
period
of
the
world
story
which
was
so
remote
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes
it
might
be
described
as
while
the
ferment
was
still
at
its
height
a
man
came
to
the
british
embassy
who
said
that
he
was
a
member
of
a
tribe
which
had
its
habitat
on
the
banks
of
the
white
nile
he
asserted
that
he
was
in
association
with
this
very
idolatrous
sect
though
he
denied
that
he
was
one
of
the
actual
sectaries
he
did
admit
however
that
he
had
assisted
more
than
once
at
their
orgies
and
declared
that
it
was
their
constant
practice
to
offer
young
women
as
sacrifices
preferably
white
christian
women
with
a
special
preference
if
they
could
get
them
to
young
english
women
he
vowed
that
he
himself
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
english
girls
burnt
alive
the
description
which
he
gave
of
what
preceded
and
followed
these
foul
murders
appalled
those
who
listened
he
finally
wound
up
by
offering
on
payment
of
a
stipulated
sum
of
money
to
guide
a
troop
of
soldiers
to
this
den
of
demons
so
that
they
should
arrive
there
at
a
moment
when
it
was
filled
with
worshippers
who
were
preparing
to
participate
in
an
orgie
which
was
to
take
place
during
the
next
few
days
his
offer
was
conditionally
accepted
he
was
confined
in
an
apartment
with
one
man
on
guard
inside
and
another
on
guard
outside
the
room
that
night
the
sentinel
without
was
startled
by
hearing
a
great
noise
and
frightful
screams
issuing
from
the
chamber
in
which
the
native
was
interned
he
summoned
assistance
the
door
was
opened
the
soldier
on
guard
within
was
stark
staring
mad
he
died
within
a
few
months
a
gibbering
maniac
to
the
end
the
native
was
dead
the
window
which
was
a
very
small
one
was
securely
fastened
inside
and
strongly
barred
without
there
was
nothing
to
show
by
what
means
entry
had
been
gained
yet
it
was
the
general
opinion
of
those
who
saw
the
corpse
that
the
man
had
been
destroyed
by
some
wild
beast
a
photograph
was
taken
of
the
body
after
death
a
copy
of
which
is
still
in
my
possession
in
it
are
distinctly
shown
lacerations
about
the
neck
and
the
lower
portion
of
the
abdomen
as
if
they
had
been
produced
by
the
claws
of
some
huge
and
ferocious
animal
the
skull
is
splintered
in
places
and
the
face
is
torn
to
rags
that
was
more
than
three
years
ago
the
whole
business
has
remained
as
great
a
mystery
as
ever
but
my
attention
has
once
or
twice
been
caught
by
trifling
incidents
which
have
caused
me
to
more
than
suspect
that
the
wild
tale
told
by
that
murdered
native
had
in
it
at
least
the
elements
of
truth
and
which
have
even
led
me
to
wonder
if
the
trade
in
kidnapping
was
not
being
carried
on
to
this
very
hour
and
if
women
of
my
own
flesh
and
blood
were
not
still
being
offered
up
on
that
infernal
altar
and
now
here
was
paul
lessingham
a
man
of
reputation
of
great
intellect
of
undoubted
honour
who
had
come
to
me
with
a
wholly
unconscious
verification
of
all
my
worst
suspicions
that
the
creature
spoken
of
as
an
arab
and
who
was
probably
no
more
an
arab
than
i
was
and
whose
name
was
certainly
not
mohamed
el
kheir
was
an
emissary
from
that
den
of
demons
i
had
no
doubt
what
was
the
exact
purport
of
the
creature
presence
in
england
was
another
question
possibly
part
of
the
intention
was
the
destruction
of
paul
lessingham
body
soul
and
spirit
possibly
another
part
was
the
procuration
of
fresh
victims
for
that
holocaust
that
this
latter
object
explained
the
disappearance
of
miss
lindon
i
felt
persuaded
that
she
was
designed
by
the
personification
of
evil
who
was
her
captor
to
suffer
all
the
horrors
at
which
the
stories
pointed
and
then
to
be
burned
alive
amidst
the
triumphant
yells
of
the
attendant
demons
i
was
certain
that
the
wretch
aware
that
the
pursuit
was
in
full
cry
was
tearing
twisting
doubling
and
would
stick
at
nothing
which
would
facilitate
the
smuggling
of
the
victim
out
of
england
was
clear
my
interest
in
the
quest
was
already
far
other
than
a
merely
professional
one
the
blood
in
my
veins
tingled
at
the
thought
of
such
a
woman
as
miss
lindon
being
in
the
power
of
such
a
monster
i
may
assuredly
claim
that
throughout
the
whole
business
i
was
urged
forward
by
no
thought
of
fee
or
of
reward
to
have
had
a
share
in
rescuing
that
unfortunate
girl
and
in
the
destruction
of
her
noxious
persecutor
would
have
been
reward
enough
for
me
one
is
not
always
even
in
strictly
professional
matters
influenced
by
strictly
professional
instincts
the
cab
slowed
a
voice
descended
through
the
trap

is
commercial
road

part
of

that
a
harab

the
hinspector
the
speaker
was
a
gentleman
unmistakably
of
the
class
he
was
seated
on
a
form
close
at
hand
hovered
a
policeman
whose
special
duty
it
seemed
to
be
to
keep
an
eye
upon
his
movements
do

ask
beg
your
pardon

but
i
saw
a
harab

an
address
at

pay
too
much
attention
to
what

says
if
i
were
you
i
do
suppose

particular
about
a
lie

wildly
excited
young
ragamuffin
came

person
whom
you
are
seeking
may
have
had
a
finger
in
the
pie
i
was
of
the
same
opinion
as

sort
of
a
sailors
home
she
calls
it
but
no
one
could
call
it
sweet
it
does
bear
the
best
of
characters
and
if
you
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
it
i
should
say
in
plain
english
that
it
was
a
disorderly
house
paradise
place
proved
to
be
within
three
or
four
hundred
yards
of
the
station
house
so
far
as
could
be
seen
in
the
dark
it
consisted
of
a
row
of
houses
of
considerable
dimensions
and
also
of
considerable
antiquity
they
opened
on
to
two
or
three
stone
steps
which
led
directly
into
the
street
at
one
of
the
doors
stood
an
old
lady
with
a
shawl
drawn
over
her
head
this
was
mrs
henderson
she
greeted
us
with
garrulous
volubility
you
come
you
i
thought
you
never
was
that
i
did
she
recognised
the
inspector
you
mr
phillips
is
it
perceiving
us
she
drew
a
little
back
them
parties
they
ai
coppers
mr
phillips
dismissed
her
inquiry
curtly
you
mind
who
they
are
what
this
about
someone
being
murdered
the
old
lady
glanced
round
you
speak
so
loud
mr
phillips
no
one
do
know
nothing
about
it
as
yet
the
parties
in
my
is
most
respectable
most
and
they
could
abide
the
notion
of
there
being
police
about
the
place
quite
believe
that
mrs
henderson
the
inspector
tone
was
grim
mrs
henderson
led
the
way
up
a
staircase
which
would
have
been
distinctly
the
better
for
repairs
it
was
necessary
to
pick
one
way
as
one
went
and
as
the
light
was
defective
stumbles
were
not
infrequent
our
guide
paused
outside
a
door
on
the
topmost
landing
from
some
mysterious
recess
in
her
apparel
she
produced
a
key
in
i
locked
the
door
so
that
nothing
might
be
disturbed
i
knows
particular
you
pleesmen
is
she
turned
the
key
we
all
went
in
we
this
time
in
front
and
she
behind
a
candle
was
guttering
on
a
broken
and
dilapidated
single
washhand
stand
a
small
iron
bedstead
stood
by
its
side
the
clothes
on
which
were
all
tumbled
and
tossed
there
was
a
chair
with
a
hole
in
the
seat
and
that
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
chipped
pieces
of
stoneware
and
a
small
round
mirror
which
was
hung
on
a
nail
against
the
wall
seemed
to
be
all
that
the
room
contained
i
could
see
nothing
in
the
shape
of
a
murdered
man
nor
it
appeared
could
the
inspector
either
the
meaning
of
this
mrs
henderson
i
do
see
anything
here
the
bed
mr
phillips
i
left
just
where
i
found
i
would
touched
not
for
nothing
nor
yet
let
nobody
else
touched
neither
because
as
i
say
i
know
particular
you
pleesmen
is
we
all
four
went
hastily
forward
atherton
and
i
went
to
the
head
of
the
bed
lessingham
and
the
inspector
leaning
right
across
the
bed
peeped
over
the
side
there
on
the
floor
in
the
space
which
was
between
the
bed
and
the
wall
lay
the
murdered
man
at
sight
of
him
an
exclamation
burst
from
sydney
lips
holt
god
cried
lessingham
is
marjorie
the
relief
in
his
tone
was
unmistakable
that
the
one
was
gone
was
plainly
nothing
to
him
in
comparison
with
the
fact
that
the
other
was
left
thrusting
the
bed
more
into
the
centre
of
the
room
i
knelt
down
beside
the
man
on
the
floor
a
more
deplorable
spectacle
than
he
presented
i
have
seldom
witnessed
he
was
decently
clad
in
a
grey
tweed
suit
white
hat
collar
and
necktie
and
it
was
perhaps
that
fact
which
made
his
extreme
attenuation
the
more
conspicuous
i
doubt
if
there
was
an
ounce
of
flesh
on
the
whole
of
his
body
his
cheeks
and
the
sockets
of
his
eyes
were
hollow
the
skin
was
drawn
tightly
over
his
cheek
bones
the
bones
themselves
were
staring
through
even
his
nose
was
wasted
so
that
nothing
but
a
ridge
of
cartilage
remained
i
put
my
arm
beneath
his
shoulder
and
raised
him
from
the
floor
no
resistance
was
offered
by
the
body
gravity
he
was
as
light
as
a
little
child
doubt
i
said
this
man
has
been
murdered
it
looks
to
me
like
a
case
of
starvation
or
exhaustion
possibly
a
combination
of
both
that
on
his
neck
asked
the
inspector
he
was
kneeling
at
my
side
he
referred
to
two
abrasions
of
the
skin
one
on
either
side
of
the
man
neck
look
to
me
like
scratches
they
seem
pretty
deep
but
i
think
they
sufficient
in
themselves
to
cause
death
might
be
joined
to
an
already
weakened
constitution
is
there
anything
in
his
pockets
let
lift
him
on
to
the
bed
we
lifted
him
on
to
the
bed
a
featherweight
he
was
to
lift
while
the
inspector
was
examining
his
pockets
to
find
them
empty
a
tall
man
with
a
big
black
beard
came
bustling
in
he
proved
to
be
dr
glossop
the
local
police
surgeon
who
had
been
sent
for
before
our
quitting
the
station
house
his
first
pronouncement
made
as
soon
as
he
commenced
his
examination
was
under
the
circumstances
sufficiently
startling
do
believe
the
man
dead
why
did
you
send
for
me
directly
you
found
him
the
question
was
put
to
mrs
henderson
dr
glossop
i
would
touch
myself
and
i
would
touched
by
no
one
else
because
as
i
said
afore
i
know
particular
them
pleesmen
is
in
that
case
if
he
does
die
you
have
had
a
hand
in
murdering
him
that
the
lady
sniggered
course
dr
glossop
we
all
knows
that
always
your
joke
find
it
a
joke
if
you
have
to
hang
as
you
ought
to
you
the
doctor
said
what
he
did
say
to
himself
under
his
breath
i
doubt
if
it
was
flattering
to
mrs
henderson
you
got
any
brandy
in
the
house
got
everythink
in
the
for
them
as
likes
to
pay
for
it
everythink
then
suddenly
remembering
that
the
police
were
present
and
that
hers
were
not
exactly
licensed
premises
we
can
send
out
for
it
for
them
parties
as
gives
us
the
money
being
as
is
well
known
always
willing
to
oblige
send
for
some
to
the
tap
downstairs
if
that
the
nearest
if
this
man
dies
before
you
brought
it
i
have
you
locked
up
as
sure
as
you
a
living
woman
the
arrival
of
the
brandy
was
not
long
delayed
but
the
man
on
the
bed
had
regained
consciousness
before
it
came
opening
his
eyes
he
looked
up
at
the
doctor
bending
over
him
my
man
that
more
like
the
time
of
day
how
are
you
feeling
the
patient
stared
hazily
up
at
the
doctor
as
if
his
sense
of
perception
was
not
yet
completely
restored
as
if
this
big
bearded
man
was
something
altogether
strange
atherton
bent
down
beside
the
doctor
glad
to
see
you
looking
better
mr
holt
you
know
me
do
you
i
been
running
about
after
you
all
day
long
are
you
are
the
man
eyes
closed
as
if
the
effort
at
recollection
exhausted
him
he
kept
them
closed
as
he
continued
to
speak
know
who
you
are
you
are
the
gentleman
that
it
i
the
gentleman
name
of
miss
friend
and
i
daresay
you
feeling
pretty
well
done
up
and
in
want
of
something
to
eat
and
drink
here
some
brandy
for
you
the
doctor
had
some
in
a
tumbler
he
raised
the
patient
head
allowing
it
to
trickle
down
his
throat
the
man
swallowed
it
mechanically
motionless
as
if
unconscious
what
it
was
that
he
was
doing
his
cheeks
flushed
the
passing
glow
of
colour
caused
their
condition
of
extraordinary
and
indeed
extravagant
attentuation
to
be
more
prominent
than
ever
the
doctor
laid
him
back
upon
the
bed
feeling
his
pulse
with
one
hand
while
he
stood
and
regarded
him
in
silence
then
turning
to
the
inspector
he
said
to
him
in
an
undertone
you
want
him
to
make
a
statement
he
have
to
make
it
now
going
fast
you
wo
be
able
to
get
much
out
of
him
he
too
far
gone
and
i
should
bustle
him
but
get
what
you
can
the
inspector
came
to
the
front
a
notebook
in
his
hand
understand
from
this
gentleman
signifying
atherton
your
name
robert
holt
i
an
inspector
of
police
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
has
brought
you
into
this
condition
has
anyone
been
assaulting
you
holt
opening
his
eyes
glanced
up
at
the
speaker
mistily
as
if
he
could
not
see
him
clearly
still
less
understand
what
it
was
that
he
was
saying
sydney
stooping
over
him
endeavoured
to
explain
inspector
wants
to
know
how
you
got
here
has
anyone
been
doing
anything
to
you
has
anyone
been
hurting
you
the
man
eyelids
were
partially
closed
then
they
opened
wider
and
wider
his
mouth
opened
too
on
his
skeleton
features
there
came
a
look
of
panic
fear
he
was
evidently
struggling
to
speak
at
last
words
came
beetle
he
stopped
then
after
an
effort
spoke
again
beetle
he
mean
asked
the
inspector
think
i
understand
sydney
answered
then
turning
again
to
the
man
in
the
bed
i
hear
what
you
say
the
beetle
well
has
the
beetle
done
anything
to
you
took
me
by
the
throat
that
the
meaning
of
the
marks
upon
your
neck
beetle
killed
me
the
lids
closed
the
man
relapsed
into
a
state
of
lethargy
the
inspector
was
puzzled
and
said
so
he
mean
about
a
beetle
atherton
replied
think
i
understand
what
he
means
and
my
friends
do
too
explain
afterwards
in
the
meantime
i
think
i
better
get
as
much
out
of
him
as
i
can
while
there
time
said
the
doctor
his
hand
upon
the
patient
pulse
there
time
there
is
much
only
seconds
sydney
endeavoured
to
rouse
the
man
from
his
stupor
been
with
miss
lindon
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
you
mr
holt
atherton
had
reached
a
chord
in
the
man
consciousness
his
lips
moved
in
painful
articulation
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
god
help
me
hope
god
will
help
you
my
poor
fellow
you
been
in
need
of
his
help
if
ever
man
was
miss
lindon
is
disguised
in
your
old
clothes
is
she
in
my
old
clothes
my
god
where
is
miss
lindon
now
the
man
had
been
speaking
with
his
eyes
closed
now
he
opened
them
wide
there
came
into
them
the
former
staring
horror
he
became
possessed
by
uncontrollable
agitation
half
raising
himself
in
bed
words
came
from
his
quivering
lips
as
if
they
were
only
drawn
from
him
by
the
force
of
his
anguish
beetle
going
to
kill
miss
lindon
a
momentary
paroxysm
seemed
to
shake
the
very
foundations
of
his
being
his
whole
frame
quivered
he
fell
back
on
to
the
bed
ominously
the
doctor
examined
him
in
silence
while
we
too
were
still
time
he
gone
for
good
there
be
no
conjuring
him
back
again
i
felt
a
sudden
pressure
on
my
arm
and
found
that
lessingham
was
clutching
me
with
probably
unconscious
violence
the
muscles
of
his
face
were
twitching
he
trembled
i
turned
to
the
doctor
if
there
is
any
of
that
brandy
left
will
you
let
me
have
it
for
my
friend
lessingham
disposed
of
the
remainder
of
the
worth
i
rather
fancy
it
saved
us
from
a
scene
the
inspector
was
speaking
to
the
woman
of
the
house
mrs
henderson
perhaps
you
tell
us
what
all
this
means
who
is
this
man
and
how
did
he
come
in
here
and
who
came
in
with
him
and
what
do
you
know
about
it
altogether
if
you
got
anything
to
say
say
it
only
you
better
be
careful
because
it
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
anything
you
do
say
may
be
used
against
you
chapter
xlv
all
that
mrs
knew
mrs
henderson
put
her
hands
under
her
apron
and
smirked
mr
phillips
it
do
sound
strange
to
you
talkin
to
me
like
that
anybody
think
i
done
something
as
i
did
ought
to
done
to
you
going
on
as
for
what
i
tell
you
all
i
know
with
the
greatest
willingness
on
earth
and
as
for
bein
careful
there
ai
no
call
for
you
to
tell
me
to
be
that
for
that
i
always
am
as
by
now
you
ought
to
know
i
do
know
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
mr
phillips
what
a
man
you
are
for
catching
people
up
you
rilly
are
o
course
that
ai
all
i
got
to
say
ai
i
just
to
it
come
you
presses
me
so
you
muddle
of
me
up
and
then
if
i
do
to
make
a
herror
you
say
i
a
liar
when
goodness
knows
there
ai
no
more
truthful
woman
not
in
limehouse
words
plainly
trembled
on
the
inspector
lips
which
he
refrained
from
uttering
mrs
henderson
cast
her
eyes
upwards
as
if
she
sought
for
inspiration
from
the
filthy
ceiling
far
as
i
can
swear
it
might
been
a
hour
ago
or
it
might
been
a
hour
and
a
quarter
or
it
might
been
a
hour
and
twenty
minutes
not
particular
as
to
the
seconds
i
a
knockin
at
my
front
door
and
when
i
comes
to
open
it
there
was
a
harab
party
with
a
great
bundle
on
bigger
nor
and
two
other
parties
along
with
him
this
harab
party
says
in
that
queer
foreign
way
them
harab
parties
of
talkin
a
room
for
the
night
a
room
now
i
do
much
care
for
foreigners
and
never
did
especially
them
harabs
which
their
ai
my
own
so
i
as
much
the
same
but
this
harab
party
he
did
seem
to
quite
foller
of
my
meaning
for
all
he
done
was
to
say
as
he
said
afore
a
room
for
the
night
a
room
and
he
shoves
a
couple
of
crowns
into
my
now
it
always
been
a
motter
o
mine
that
money
is
money
and
one
man
money
is
as
good
as
another
man
so
not
wishing
to
be
disagreeable
which
other
people
would
have
taken
if
i
i
shows
up
i
been
downstairs
it
might
been
a
hour
when
i
a
shindy
from
this
room
sort
of
a
shindy
and
shrieking
oh
my
gracious
it
was
enough
to
set
your
blood
all
curdled
for
i
never
did
nothing
like
it
we
do
troublesome
parties
in
like
they
do
elsewhere
but
i
never
did
nothing
like
that
before
i
stood
it
for
about
a
minute
but
it
kep
on
and
kep
on
and
every
moment
i
expected
as
the
other
parties
as
was
in
the
would
be
complainin
so
up
i
comes
and
i
thumps
at
the
door
and
it
seemed
that
thump
i
might
for
all
the
notice
that
was
took
of
me
the
noise
keep
on
on
i
should
think
it
did
keep
on
lord
love
you
shriek
after
shriek
i
expected
to
see
the
roof
took
off
there
any
other
noises
for
instance
were
there
any
sounds
of
struggling
or
of
blows
were
no
sounds
except
of
the
party
hollering
party
only
party
only
as
i
says
afore
shriek
after
shriek
when
you
put
your
ear
to
the
panel
there
was
a
noise
like
some
other
party
blubbering
but
that
were
nothing
as
for
the
hollering
you
have
thought
that
nothing
what
you
might
call
could
kep
up
such
a
screechin
i
thumps
and
thumps
and
at
last
when
i
did
think
that
i
should
to
the
door
broke
down
the
harab
says
to
me
from
inside
go
away
i
pay
for
the
room
go
away
i
did
think
that
pretty
good
i
tell
you
that
so
i
says
pay
for
the
room
or
not
pay
for
the
room
you
did
pay
to
make
that
shindy
and
what
more
i
says
if
i
it
again
i
says
out
you
goes
and
if
you
do
go
quiet
i
somebody
in
as
pretty
quickly
make
you
was
there
silence
to
speak
there
was
only
there
was
this
sound
as
if
some
party
was
and
another
sound
as
if
a
party
was
for
his
breath
what
happened
that
so
to
speak
all
was
quiet
down
i
went
again
and
in
another
quarter
of
a
hour
or
it
might
been
twenty
minutes
i
went
to
the
front
door
to
get
a
mouthful
of
hair
and
mrs
barker
what
lives
over
the
road
at
no
she
comes
to
me
and
says
that
there
arab
party
of
yours
did
stop
long
i
looks
at
i
do
quite
foller
you
i
says
which
i
did
i
saw
him
come
in
she
says
and
then
a
few
minutes
back
i
see
go
again
with
a
great
bundle
on
he
could
stagger
under
oh
i
says
that
news
to
me
i
did
know
gone
nor
see
him
neither
which
i
did
so
up
i
comes
again
and
sure
enough
the
door
was
open
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
room
was
empty
till
i
come
upon
this
pore
young
man
what
was
lying
the
bed
there
was
a
growl
from
the
doctor
you
had
any
sense
and
sent
for
me
at
once
he
might
have
been
alive
at
this
moment
was
i
to
know
that
dr
glossop
i
could
tell
my
finding
there
murdered
was
quite
enough
for
me
so
i
runs
downstairs
and
i
nips
of
barley
what
was
leaning
against
the
wall
and
i
says
to
him
barley
run
to
the
station
as
fast
as
you
can
and
tell
that
a
man
been
murdered
that
harab
been
and
killed
a
bloke
and
that
all
i
know
about
it
and
i
could
tell
you
no
more
mr
phillips
not
if
you
was
to
keep
on
asking
me
questions
not
for
hours
and
you
think
it
was
this
man
with
a
motion
towards
the
bed
was
shrieking
tell
you
the
truth
mr
phillips
about
that
i
do
know
what
to
think
if
you
asked
me
i
should
said
it
was
a
woman
i
ought
to
know
a
woman
holler
when
i
it
if
any
one
does
enough
of
in
my
time
goodness
knows
and
i
should
said
that
only
a
woman
could
hollered
like
that
and
only
when
she
was
raving
mad
but
there
were
no
woman
with
him
there
was
only
this
man
what
murdered
and
the
other
man
and
as
for
the
other
man
i
will
say
this
that
got
twopennyworth
of
clothes
to
cover
but
mr
phillips

last
harab

under
my
roof

matter
what
they
pays
and
you
may
mark
my
words
i
no
more
mrs
henderson
once
more
glancing
upward
as
if
she
imagined
herself
to
have
made
some
declaration
of
a
religious
nature
shook
her
head
with
much
solemnity
chapter
xlvi
the
sudden
stopping
as
we
were
leaving
the
house
a
constable
gave
the
inspector
a
note
having
read
it
he
passed
it
to
me
it
was
from
the
local
office
received
that
an
arab
with
a
big
bundle
on
his
head
has
been
noticed
loitering
about
the
neighbourhood
of
st
pancras
station
he
seemed
to
be
accompanied
by
a
young
man
who
had
the
appearance
of
a
tramp
young
man
seemed
ill
they
appeared
to
be
waiting
for
a
train
probably
to
the
north
shall
i
advise
detention
i
scribbled
on
the
flyleaf
of
the
note
them
detained
if
they
have
gone
by
train
have
a
special
in
readiness
in
a
minute
we
were
again
in
the
cab
i
endeavoured
to
persuade
lessingham
and
atherton
to
allow
me
to
conduct
the
pursuit
alone
in
vain
i
had
no
fear
of
atherton
succumbing
but
i
was
afraid
for
lessingham
what
was
more
almost
than
the
expectation
of
his
collapse
was
the
fact
that
his
looks
and
manner
his
whole
bearing
so
eloquent
of
the
agony
and
agitation
of
his
mind
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
my
nerves
a
catastrophe
of
some
sort
i
foresaw
of
the
curtain
fall
upon
one
tragedy
we
had
just
been
witnesses
that
there
was
worse
much
worse
to
follow
i
did
not
doubt
optimistic
anticipations
were
out
of
the
question
that
the
creature
we
were
chasing
would
relinquish
the
prey
uninjured
no
one
after
what
we
had
seen
and
heard
could
by
any
possibility
suppose
should
a
necessity
suddenly
arise
for
prompt
and
immediate
action
that
lessingham
would
prove
a
hindrance
rather
than
a
help
i
felt
persuaded
but
since
moments
were
precious
and
lessingham
was
not
to
be
persuaded
to
allow
the
matter
to
proceed
without
him
all
that
remained
was
to
make
the
best
of
his
presence
the
great
arch
of
st
pancras
was
in
darkness
an
occasional
light
seemed
to
make
the
darkness
still
more
visible
the
station
seemed
deserted
i
thought
at
first
that
there
was
not
a
soul
about
the
place
that
our
errand
was
in
vain
that
the
only
thing
for
us
to
do
was
to
drive
to
the
police
station
and
to
pursue
our
inquiries
there
but
as
we
turned
towards
the
our
footsteps
ringing
out
clearly
through
the
silence
and
the
night
a
door
opened
a
light
shone
out
from
the
room
within
and
a
voice
inquired
that
name
champnell
has
a
message
been
received
from
me
from
the
limehouse
police
station
this
way
we
stepped
that
way
into
a
snug
enough
office
of
which
one
of
the
railway
inspectors
was
apparently
in
charge
he
was
a
big
man
with
a
fair
beard
he
looked
me
up
and
down
as
if
doubtfully
lessingham
he
recognised
at
once
he
took
off
his
cap
to
him
lessingham
i
believe
am
mr
lessingham
have
you
any
news
for
me
i
fancy
by
his
looks
that
the
official
was
struck
by
the
pallor
of
the
speaker
face
and
by
his
tremulous
voice
am
instructed
to
give
certain
information
to
a
mr
augustus
champnell
am
mr
champnell
what
your
information
reference
to
the
arab
about
whom
you
have
been
making
inquiries
a
foreigner
dressed
like
an
arab
with
a
great
bundle
on
his
head
took
two
single
thirds
for
hull
by
the
midnight
express
he
alone
is
believed
that
he
was
accompanied
by
a
young
man
of
very
disreputable
appearance
they
were
not
together
at
the
but
they
had
been
seen
together
previously
a
minute
or
so
after
the
arab
had
entered
the
train
this
young
man
got
into
the
same
compartment
they
were
in
the
front
waggon
were
they
not
detained
had
no
authority
to
detain
them
nor
any
reason
until
your
message
was
received
a
few
minutes
ago
we
at
this
station
were
not
aware
that
inquiries
were
being
made
for
them
say
he
booked
to
hull
does
the
train
run
through
to
hull
it
does
go
to
hull
at
all
part
of
it
the
liverpool
and
manchester
express
and
part
of
it
for
carlisle
it
divides
at
derby
the
man
you
looking
for
will
change
either
at
sheffield
or
at
cudworth
junction
and
go
on
to
hull
by
the
first
train
in
the
morning
there
a
local
service
i
looked
at
my
watch
say
the
train
left
at
midnight
it
now
nearly
past
where
it
now
st
albans
it
due
there
there
be
time
for
a
wire
to
reach
st
albans
and
anyhow
there
only
be
enough
railway
officials
about
the
place
to
receive
and
despatch
the
train
they
be
fully
occupied
with
their
ordinary
duties
there
wo
be
time
to
get
the
police
there
could
wire
to
st
albans
to
inquire
if
they
were
still
in
the
train
could
be
done
certainly
i
have
it
done
at
once
if
you
like
where
the
next
stoppage
they
at
luton
at
but
that
another
case
of
st
albans
you
see
there
wo
be
much
more
than
twenty
minutes
by
the
time
got
your
wire
off
and
i
do
expect
there
be
many
people
awake
at
luton
at
these
country
places
sometimes
there
a
policeman
hanging
about
the
station
to
see
the
express
go
through
but
on
the
other
hand
very
often
there
is
and
if
there
is
probably
at
this
time
of
night
it
take
a
good
bit
of
time
to
get
the
police
on
the
premises
i
tell
you
what
i
should
advise
that
train
is
due
at
bedford
at
send
your
wire
there
there
ought
to
be
plenty
of
people
about
at
bedford
and
anyhow
there
be
time
to
get
the
police
to
the
station
good
i
instructed
them
to
tell
you
to
have
a
special
ready
have
you
got
one
an
engine
with
steam
up
in
the
shed
we
have
all
ready
for
you
in
less
than
ten
minutes
and
i
tell
you
what
you
have
about
fifty
minutes
before
the
train
is
due
at
bedford
it
a
fifty
mile
run
with
luck
you
ought
to
get
there
pretty
nearly
as
soon
as
the
express
shall
i
tell
them
to
get
ready
once
while
he
issued
directions
through
a
telephone
to
what
i
presume
was
the
engine
shed
i
drew
up
a
couple
of
telegrams
having
completed
his
orders
he
turned
to
me
coming
out
of
the
siding
now
they
be
ready
in
less
than
ten
minutes
i
see
that
the
line
kept
clear
have
you
got
those
wires
is
one
this
is
for
bedford
it
ran
the
arab
who
is
in
train
due
at
when
leaving
st
pancras
he
was
in
a
compartment
in
front
waggon
he
has
a
large
bundle
which
detain
he
took
two
third
singles
for
hull
also
detain
his
companion
who
is
dressed
like
a
tramp
this
is
a
young
lady
whom
the
arab
has
disguised
and
kidnapped
while
in
a
condition
of
hypnotic
trance
let
her
have
medical
assistance
and
be
taken
to
a
hotel
all
expenses
will
be
paid
on
the
arrival
of
the
undersigned
who
is
following
by
special
train
as
the
arab
will
probably
be
very
violent
a
sufficient
force
of
police
should
be
in
waiting
champnell
this
is
the
other
it
is
probably
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
at
st
albans
but
send
it
there
and
also
to
luton
arab
with
companion
in
train
which
left
st
pancras
at
if
so
do
not
let
them
get
out
till
train
reaches
bedford
where
instructions
are
being
wired
for
arrest
the
inspector
rapidly
scanned
them
both
ought
to
do
your
business
i
should
think
come
along
with
me
i
have
them
sent
at
once
and
we
see
if
your
train
ready
the
train
was
not
ready
nor
was
it
ready
within
the
prescribed
ten
minutes
there
was
some
hitch
i
fancy
about
a
saloon
finally
we
had
to
be
content
with
an
ordinary
carriage
the
delay
however
was
not
altogether
time
lost
just
as
the
engine
with
its
solitary
coach
was
approaching
the
platform
someone
came
running
up
with
an
envelope
in
his
hand
from
st
albans
i
tore
it
open
it
was
brief
and
to
the
point
with
companion
was
in
train
when
it
left
here
am
wiring
luton
all
right
now
unless
something
wholly
unforeseen
takes
place
we
ought
to
have
them
that
unforeseen
i
went
forward
with
the
inspector
and
the
guard
of
our
train
to
exchange
a
few
final
words
with
the
driver
the
inspector
explained
what
instructions
he
had
given
told
the
driver
not
to
spare
his
coal
but
to
take
you
into
bedford
within
five
minutes
after
the
arrival
of
the
express
he
says
he
thinks
that
he
can
do
it
the
driver
leaned
over
his
engine
rubbing
his
hands
with
the
usual
oily
rag
he
was
a
short
wiry
man
with
grey
hair
and
a
grizzled
moustache
with
about
him
that
bearing
of
resolution
which
one
notes
about
as
a
class
ought
to
do
it
the
gradients
are
against
us
but
it
a
clear
night
and
there
no
wind
the
only
thing
that
will
stop
us
will
be
if
there
any
shunting
on
the
road
or
any
luggage
trains
of
course
if
we
are
blocked
we
are
blocked
but
the
inspector
says
he
clear
the
way
for
us
said
the
inspector
clear
the
way
i
wired
down
the
road
already
atherton
broke
in
if
you
get
us
into
bedford
within
five
minutes
of
the
arrival
of
the
mail
there
be
a
note
to
divide
between
your
mate
and
you
the
driver
grinned
get
you
there
in
time
sir
if
we
have
to
go
clear
through
the
shunters
it
is
often
we
get
a
chance
of
a
note
for
a
run
to
bedford
and
we
do
our
best
to
earn
it
the
fireman
waved
his
hand
in
the
rear
right
sir
he
cried
have
to
trouble
you
for
that
note
so
soon
as
we
were
clear
of
the
station
it
began
to
seem
probable
that
as
the
fireman
put
it
atherton
would
be
journeying
in
a
train
which
consists
of
a
single
carriage
attached
to
an
engine
which
is
flying
at
topmost
speed
is
a
very
different
business
from
being
an
occupant
of
an
ordinary
train
which
is
travelling
at
ordinary
express
rates
i
had
discovered
that
for
myself
before
that
night
it
was
impressed
on
me
more
than
ever
a
tyro
or
even
a
nervous
might
have
been
excused
for
expecting
at
every
moment
we
were
going
to
be
derailed
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
the
carriage
had
any
springs
it
rocked
and
swung
and
jogged
and
jolted
of
smooth
travelling
had
we
none
talking
was
out
of
the
question
and
for
that
i
personally
was
grateful
quite
apart
from
the
difficulty
we
experienced
in
keeping
our
seats
and
when
every
moment
our
position
was
being
altered
and
we
were
jerked
backwards
and
forwards
up
and
down
this
way
and
that
that
was
a
business
which
required
care
the
noise
was
deafening
it
was
as
though
we
were
being
pursued
by
a
legion
of
shrieking
bellowing
raging
demons
shrieked
atherton
does
mean
to
earn
that
fiver
i
hope
i
be
alive
to
pay
it
him
he
was
only
at
the
other
end
of
the
carriage
but
though
i
could
see
by
the
distortion
of
his
visage
that
he
was
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
he
has
a
voice
i
only
caught
here
and
there
a
word
or
two
of
what
he
was
saying
i
had
to
make
sense
of
the
whole
lessingham
contortions
were
a
study
few
of
that
large
multitude
of
persons
who
are
acquainted
with
him
only
by
means
of
the
portraits
which
have
appeared
in
the
illustrated
papers
would
then
have
recognised
the
rising
statesman
yet
i
believe
that
few
things
could
have
better
fallen
in
with
his
mood
than
that
wild
travelling
he
might
have
been
almost
shaken
to
pieces
but
the
very
severity
of
the
shaking
served
to
divert
his
thoughts
from
the
one
dread
topic
which
threatened
to
absorb
them
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
beside
then
there
was
the
tonic
influence
of
the
element
of
risk
the
effect
of
a
spice
of
peril
actual
danger
there
quite
probably
was
none
but
there
very
really
seemed
to
be
and
one
thing
was
absolutely
certain
that
if
we
did
come
to
smash
while
going
at
that
speed
we
should
come
to
as
everlasting
smash
as
the
heart
of
man
could
by
any
possibility
desire
it
is
probable
that
the
knowledge
that
this
was
so
warmed
the
blood
in
lessingham
veins
at
any
rate
as
to
use
what
in
this
case
was
simply
a
form
of
speech
i
sat
and
watched
him
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
getting
a
firmer
hold
of
the
strength
which
had
all
but
escaped
him
and
that
with
every
jog
and
jolt
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
of
a
man
on
and
on
we
went
dashing
clashing
smashing
roaring
rumbling
atherton
who
had
been
endeavouring
to
peer
through
the
window
strained
his
lungs
again
in
the
effort
to
make
himself
audible
the
devil
are
we
looking
at
my
watch
i
screamed
back
at
him
nearly
one
so
i
suppose
we
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
hollo
what
the
matter
that
something
was
the
matter
seemed
certain
there
was
a
shrill
whistle
from
the
engine
in
a
second
we
were
conscious
almost
too
conscious
of
the
application
of
the
westinghouse
brake
of
all
the
jolting
that
was
ever
jolted
the
mere
reverberation
of
the
carriage
threatened
to
resolve
our
bodies
into
their
component
parts
feeling
what
we
felt
then
helped
us
to
realise
the
retardatory
force
which
that
vacuum
brake
must
be
exerting
it
did
not
seem
at
all
surprising
that
the
train
should
have
been
brought
to
an
almost
instant
simultaneously
all
three
of
us
were
on
our
feet
i
let
down
my
window
and
atherton
let
down
his
he
shouting
out
should
think
that
inspector
wire
has
had
it
proper
effect
looks
as
if
we
blocked
or
else
we
stopped
at
luton
it
ca
be
bedford
it
was
bedford
so
much
seemed
clear
though
at
first
from
my
window
i
could
make
out
nothing
i
was
feeling
more
than
a
trifle
dazed
there
was
a
singing
in
my
ears
the
sudden
darkness
was
impenetrable
then
i
became
conscious
that
the
guard
was
opening
the
door
of
his
compartment
he
stood
on
the
step
for
a
moment
seeming
to
hesitate
then
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
he
descended
on
to
the
line
the
matter
i
asked
know
sir
seems
as
if
there
was
something
on
the
road
up
there
this
was
to
the
man
on
the
engine
the
fireman
replied
in
front
there
waving
a
red
light
like
mad
lucky
i
caught
sight
of
him
we
should
have
been
clean
on
top
of
him
in
another
moment
looks
as
if
there
was
something
wrong
here
he
comes
as
my
eyes
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
darkness
i
became
aware
that
someone
was
making
what
haste
he
could
along
the
way
swinging
a
red
light
as
he
came
our
guard
advanced
to
meet
him
shouting
as
he
went
the
matter
who
that
a
voice
replied
god
is
that
george
hewett
i
thought
you
were
coming
right
on
top
of
us
our
guard
again
jim
branson
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
what
wrong
i
thought
you
were
on
the
twelve
out
we
chasing
you
you
then
you
caught
us
thank
god
for
it
we
a
wreck
i
had
already
opened
the
carriage
door
with
that
we
all
three
clambered
out
on
to
the
line
chapter
xlvii
the
contents
of
the
carriage
i
moved
to
the
stranger
who
was
holding
the
lamp
he
was
in
official
uniform
you
the
guard
of
the
out
from
st
pancras
am
your
train
what
happened
for
where
it
is
there
it
is
right
in
front
of
you
what
left
of
it
as
to
what
happened
why
we
wrecked
do
you
mean
by
you
wrecked
heavy
loaded
trucks
broke
loose
from
a
goods
in
front
and
came
running
down
the
hill
on
top
of
us
long
ago
was
it
ten
minutes
i
was
just
starting
off
down
the
road
to
the
signal
box
it
a
good
two
miles
away
when
i
saw
you
coming
my
god
i
thought
there
was
going
to
be
another
smash
damage
done
to
me
as
if
we
all
smashed
up
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
they
matchboxed
up
in
front
i
feel
as
if
i
was
all
broken
up
inside
of
me
i
been
in
the
service
going
on
for
thirty
years
and
this
is
the
first
accident
i
been
in
it
was
too
dark
to
see
the
man
face
but
judging
from
his
tone
he
was
either
crying
or
very
near
to
it
our
guard
turned
and
shouted
back
to
our
engine
better
go
back
to
the
box
and
let
know
right
came
echoing
back
the
special
immediately
commenced
retreating
whistling
continually
as
it
went
all
the
country
side
must
have
heard
the
engine
shrieking
and
all
who
did
hear
must
have
understood
that
on
the
line
something
was
seriously
wrong
the
smashed
train
was
all
in
darkness
the
force
of
the
collision
had
put
out
all
the
carriage
lamps
here
was
a
flickering
candle
there
the
glimmer
of
a
match
these
were
all
the
lights
which
shone
upon
the
scene
people
were
piling
up
debris
by
the
side
of
the
line
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
fire
more
for
illumination
than
for
warmth
many
of
the
passengers
had
succeeded
in
freeing
themselves
and
were
moving
hither
and
thither
about
the
line
but
the
majority
appeared
to
be
still
imprisoned
the
carriage
doors
were
jammed
without
the
necessary
tools
it
was
impossible
to
open
them
every
step
we
took
our
ears
were
saluted
by
piteous
cries
men
women
children
appealed
to
us
for
help
the
door
sir
the
name
of
god
sir
open
the
door
over
and
over
again
in
all
sorts
of
tones
with
all
degrees
of
violence
the
supplication
was
repeated
the
guards
vainly
endeavoured
to
appease
the
in
many
cases
creatures
right
sir
if
you
only
wait
a
minute
or
two
madam
we
get
the
doors
open
without
tools
a
special
train
just
started
off
to
get
them
if
you
only
have
patience
there
be
plenty
of
help
for
everyone
of
you
directly
you
be
quite
safe
in
there
if
you
only
keep
still
but
that
was
just
what
they
found
it
most
difficult
to
do
keep
still
in
the
front
of
the
train
all
was
chaos
the
trucks
which
had
done
the
mischief
there
were
afterwards
shown
to
be
six
of
them
together
with
two
guards
vans
appeared
to
have
been
laden
with
bags
of
portland
cement
the
bags
had
burst
and
everything
was
covered
with
what
seemed
gritty
dust
the
air
was
full
of
the
stuff
it
got
into
our
eyes
half
blinding
us
the
engine
of
the
express
had
turned
a
complete
somersault
it
vomited
forth
smoke
and
steam
and
flames
every
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
woodwork
of
the
carriages
immediately
behind
and
beneath
would
catch
fire
the
front
coaches
were
as
the
guard
had
put
it
they
were
nothing
but
a
heap
of
debris
telescoped
into
one
another
in
a
state
of
apparently
inextricable
confusion
it
was
broad
daylight
before
access
was
gained
to
what
had
once
been
the
interiors
the
condition
of
the
first
compartment
revealed
an
extraordinary
state
of
things
scattered
all
over
it
were
pieces
of
what
looked
like
partially
burnt
rags
and
fragments
of
silk
and
linen
i
have
those
fragments
now
experts
have
assured
me
that
they
are
actually
neither
of
silk
nor
linen
but
of
some
material
animal
rather
than
vegetable
with
which
they
are
wholly
unacquainted
on
the
cushions
and
woodwork
especially
on
the
woodwork
of
the
floor
were
huge
blotches
stains
of
some
sort
when
first
noticed
they
were
damp
and
gave
out
a
most
unpleasant
smell
one
of
the
pieces
of
woodwork
is
yet
in
my
possession
with
the
stain
still
on
it
experts
have
pronounced
upon
it
too
with
the
result
that
opinions
are
divided
some
maintain
that
the
stain
was
produced
by
human
blood
which
had
been
subjected
to
a
great
heat
and
so
to
speak
parboiled
others
declare
that
it
is
the
blood
of
some
wild
animal
possibly
of
some
creature
of
the
cat
species
yet
others
affirm
that
it
is
not
blood
at
all
but
merely
paint
while
a
fourth
describes
it
as
i
quote
the
written
opinion
which
lies
in
front
of
me
apparently
by
a
deposit
of
some
sort
of
viscid
matter
probably
the
excretion
of
some
variety
of
lizard
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
was
the
body
of
what
seemed
a
young
man
costumed
like
a
tramp
it
was
marjorie
lindon
so
far
as
a
most
careful
search
revealed
that
was
all
the
compartment
contained
chapter
xlviii
the
conclusion
of
the
matter
it
is
several
years
since
i
bore
my
part
in
the
events
which
i
have
rapidly
sketched
or
i
should
not
have
felt
justified
in
giving
them
publicity
exactly
how
many
years
for
reasons
which
should
be
sufficiently
obvious
i
must
decline
to
say
marjorie
lindon
still
lives
the
spark
of
life
which
was
left
in
her
when
she
was
extricated
from
among
the
debris
of
the
wrecked
express
was
fanned
again
into
flame
her
restoration
was
however
not
merely
an
affair
of
weeks
or
months
it
was
a
matter
of
years
i
believe
that
even
after
her
physical
powers
were
completely
restored
in
itself
a
tedious
task
she
was
for
something
like
three
years
under
medical
supervision
as
a
lunatic
but
all
that
skill
and
money
could
do
was
done
and
in
course
of
time
the
great
healer
the
results
were
entirely
satisfactory
her
father
is
dead
and
has
left
her
in
possession
of
the
family
estates
she
is
married
to
the
individual
who
in
these
pages
has
been
known
as
paul
lessingham
were
his
real
name
divulged
she
would
be
recognised
as
the
popular
and
universally
reverenced
wife
of
one
of
the
greatest
statesmen
the
age
has
seen
nothing
has
been
said
to
her
about
the
fateful
day
on
which
she
was
consciously
or
unconsciously
paraded
through
london
in
the
tattered
masculine
habiliments
of
a
vagabond
she
herself
has
never
once
alluded
to
it
with
the
return
of
reason
the
affair
seems
to
have
passed
from
her
memory
as
wholly
as
if
it
had
never
been
which
although
she
may
not
know
it
is
not
the
least
cause
she
has
for
thankfulness
therefore
what
actually
transpired
will
never
in
all
human
probability
be
certainly
known
and
particularly
what
precisely
occurred
in
the
railway
carriage
during
that
dreadful
moment
of
sudden
passing
from
life
unto
death
what
became
of
the
creature
who
all
but
did
her
to
death
who
he
was
if
it
was
a
which
is
extremely
doubtful
whence
he
came
whither
he
went
what
was
the
purport
of
his
presence
here
to
this
hour
these
things
are
puzzles
paul
lessingham
has
not
since
been
troubled
by
his
old
tormentor
he
has
ceased
to
be
a
haunted
man
none
the
less
he
continues
to
have
what
seems
to
be
a
constitutional
disrelish
for
the
subject
of
beetles
nor
can
he
himself
be
induced
to
speak
of
them
should
they
be
mentioned
in
a
general
conversation
should
he
be
unable
to
immediately
bring
about
a
change
of
theme
he
will
if
possible
get
up
and
leave
the
room
more
on
this
point
he
and
his
wife
are
one
the
fact
may
not
be
generally
known
but
it
is
so
also
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
there
still
are
moments
in
which
he
harks
back
with
something
like
physical
shrinking
to
that
awful
nightmare
of
the
past
and
in
which
he
prays
god
that
as
it
is
distant
from
him
now
so
may
it
be
kept
far
off
from
him
for
ever
before
closing
one
matter
may
be
casually
mentioned
the
tale
has
never
been
told
but
i
have
unimpeachable
authority
for
its
authenticity
during
the
recent
expeditionary
advance
towards
dongola
a
body
of
native
troops
which
was
encamped
at
a
remote
spot
in
the
desert
was
aroused
one
night
by
what
seemed
to
be
the
sound
of
a
loud
explosion
the
next
morning
at
a
distance
of
about
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
camp
a
huge
hole
was
discovered
in
the
ground
as
if
blasting
operations
on
an
enormous
scale
had
recently
been
carried
on
in
the
hole
itself
and
round
about
it
were
found
fragments
of
what
seemed
bodies
credible
witnesses
have
assured
me
that
they
were
bodies
neither
of
men
nor
women
but
of
creatures
of
some
monstrous
growth
i
prefer
to
believe
since
no
scientific
examination
of
the
remains
took
place
that
these
witnesses
ignorantly
though
innocently
erred
one
thing
is
sure
numerous
pieces
both
of
stone
and
of
metal
were
seen
which
went
far
to
suggest
that
some
curious
subterranean
building
had
been
blown
up
by
the
force
of
the
explosion
especially
were
there
portions
of
moulded
metal
which
seemed
to
belong
to
what
must
have
been
an
immense
bronze
statue
there
were
picked
up
also
more
than
a
dozen
replicas
in
bronze
of
the
whilom
sacred
scarabaeus
that
the
den
of
demons
described
by
paul
lessingham
had
that
night
at
last
come
to
an
end
and
that
these
things
which
lay
scattered
here
and
there
on
that
treeless
plain
were
the
evidences
of
its
final
destruction
is
not
a
hypothesis
which
i
should
care
to
advance
with
any
degree
of
certainty
but
putting
this
and
that
together
the
facts
seem
to
point
that
way
and
it
is
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
desired
sydney
atherton
has
married
miss
dora
grayling
her
wealth
has
made
him
one
of
the
richest
men
in
england
she
began
the
story
goes
by
loving
him
immensely
i
can
answer
for
the
fact
that
he
has
ended
by
loving
her
as
much
their
devotion
to
each
other
contradicts
the
pessimistic
nonsense
which
supposes
that
every
marriage
must
be
of
necessity
a
failure
he
continues
his
career
of
an
inventor
his
investigations
into
the
subject
of
aerial
flight
which
have
brought
the
flying
machine
within
the
range
of
practical
politics
are
on
everybody
tongue
the
best
man
at
atherton
wedding
was
percy
woodville
now
the
earl
of
barnes
within
six
months
afterwards
he
married
one
of
mrs
bridesmaids
it
was
never
certainly
shown
how
robert
holt
came
to
his
end
at
the
inquest
the
coroner
jury
was
content
to
return
a
verdict
of
of
exhaustion
he
lies
buried
in
kensal
green
cemetery
under
a
handsome
tombstone
the
cost
of
which
had
he
had
it
in
his
pockets
might
have
indefinitely
prolonged
his
days
it
should
be
mentioned
that
that
portion
of
this
strange
history
which
purports
to
be
the
surprising
narration
of
robert
holt
was
compiled
from
the
statements
which
holt
made
to
atherton
and
to
miss
lindon
as
she
then
was
when
a
shattered
derelict
he
lay
at
the
lady
father
house
miss
linden
contribution
towards
the
elucidation
of
the
mystery
was
written
with
her
own
hand
after
her
physical
strength
had
come
back
to
her
and
while
mentally
she
still
hovered
between
the
darkness
and
the
light
her
one
relaxation
was
writing
although
she
would
never
speak
of
what
she
had
written
it
was
found
that
her
theme
was
always
the
same
she
confided
to
pen
and
paper
what
she
would
not
speak
of
with
her
lips
she
told
and
and
again
the
story
of
her
love
and
of
her
tribulation
so
far
as
it
is
contained
in
the
present
volume
her
mss
invariably
began
and
ended
at
the
same
point
they
have
all
of
them
been
destroyed
with
one
exception
that
exception
is
herein
placed
before
the
reader
on
the
subject
of
the
mystery
of
the
beetle
i
do
not
propose
to
pronounce
a
confident
opinion
atherton
and
i
have
talked
it
over
many
and
many
a
time
and
at
the
end
we
have
got
no
so
far
as
i
am
personally
concerned
experience
has
taught
me
that
there
are
indeed
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamed
of
in
our
philosophy
and
i
am
quite
prepared
to
believe
that
the
beetle
which
others
saw
but
i
never
was
or
is
for
it
can
not
be
certainly
shown
that
the
thing
is
not
still
existing
a
creature
born
neither
of
god
nor
man
