the
belovéd
vagabond
chapter
i
this
is
not
a
story
about
myself
like
canning
i
have
none
to
tell
it
is
the
story
of
paragot
the
belovéd
vagabond
please
pronounce
his
name
and
if
i
obtrude
myself
on
your
notice
it
is
because
i
was
so
much
involved
in
the
medley
of
farce
and
tragedy
which
made
up
some
years
of
his
life
that
i
do
know
how
to
tell
the
story
otherwise
to
paragot
i
owe
everything
he
is
at
once
my
benefactor
my
venerated
master
my
beloved
friend
my
creator
clay
in
his
hands
he
moulded
me
according
to
his
caprice
and
inspired
me
with
the
breath
of
life
my
existence
is
drenched
with
the
colour
of
paragot
i
lay
claim
to
no
personality
of
my
own
and
any
that
may
fall
from
my
pen
in
the
course
of
the
ensuing
narrative
are
but
reflections
of
paragot
philosophy
men
have
spoken
evil
of
him
he
snapped
his
fingers
at
calumny
but
i
winced
never
having
reached
the
calm
altitudes
of
scorn
wherein
his
soul
has
its
habitation
i
burned
to
defend
him
and
i
burn
now
and
that
is
why
i
propose
to
write
his
his
justification
why
he
singled
me
out
for
adoption
from
among
the
unwashed
urchins
of
london
i
never
could
conjecture
once
i
asked
him
because
said
he
you
were
ugly
dirty
ricketty
underfed
and
wholly
uninteresting
also
because
your
mother
was
the
very
worst
that
ever
breathed
gin
into
a
i
did
not
resent
these
charges
direct
and
implied
against
my
mother
she
did
launder
villainously
and
she
did
drink
gin
and
of
the
nine
she
brought
into
the
world
i
think
i
was
the
most
unkempt
and
neglected
i
know
that
books
tell
you
to
love
your
mother
but
if
the
only
maternal
caresses
you
could
remember
were
administered
by
means
of
a
wet
pair
of
woollen
drawers
or
the
edge
of
a
hot
you
would
find
filial
piety
a
virtue
somewhat
abstract
verily
do
earwigs
care
more
for
their
progeny
than
did
my
mother
she
sold
me
body
and
soul
to
paragot
for
it
fell
out
thus
one
morning
laden
with
his
technically
speaking
clean
linen
i
knocked
at
the
door
of
paragot
chambers
he
called
them
chambers
for
he
was
nothing
if
not
grandiloquent
but
really
they
consisted
in
an
attic
in
tavistock
street
covent
garden
above
the
curious
club
over
which
he
presided
i
knocked
then
at
the
door
a
sonorous
voice
bade
me
enter
paragot
lay
in
bed
smoking
a
huge
pipe
with
a
porcelain
bowl
and
reading
a
book
the
fact
of
one
individual
having
a
room
all
to
himself
impressed
me
so
greatly
with
a
sense
of
luxury
refinement
and
power
that
i
neglected
to
observe
its
pitifulness
and
squalor
nor
of
paragot
personal
appearance
was
i
critical
he
had
long
black
hair
and
a
long
black
beard
and
long
black
the
last
were
so
long
and
commanding
that
i
thought
ashamedly
of
my
own
bitten
fingertips
and
vowed
that
when
i
too
became
a
great
man
able
to
smoke
a
porcelain
pipe
of
mornings
in
my
own
room
my
nails
should
equal
his
in
splendour
i
have
brought
the
washing
sir
i
announced
and
please
sir
mother
says
i
not
to
let
you
have
it
unless
you
settle
up
for
the
last
three
weeks
i
had
a
transient
vision
of
swarthy
hairy
legs
as
paragot
leaped
out
of
bed
he
stood
over
me
man
of
all
the
luxuries
that
he
was
in
his
nightshirt
fancy
having
a
shirt
for
the
day
and
a
shirt
for
the
night
do
you
mean
that
you
will
dispute
possession
of
it
with
me
et
yes
sir
said
i
confused
he
laughed
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
called
me
david
jack
the
and
bade
me
deliver
the
i
fumbled
in
the
pocket
of
my
torn
jacket
and
handed
him
a
greasy
mass
of
paper
as
soon
as
his
eyes
fell
on
it
i
realised
my
mistake
and
produced
the
washing
book
from
the
other
pocket
i
given
you
the
wrong
one
sir
said
i
reaching
for
the
treasure
i
had
surrendered
but
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
and
dived
his
legs
beneath
the
clothes
wonderful
he
cried
he
is
four
foot
nothing
he
looks
like
a
yard
of
he
would
fight
me
for
an
shirt
and
a
pair
of
holes
with
bits
of
sock
round
them
and
he
reads
lost
he
made
a
gesture
of
throwing
the
disreputable
epic
at
my
head
and
i
curved
my
arm
in
an
attitude
only
too
familiarly
defensive
i
found
it
in
a
bundle
of
washing
sir
i
cried
apologetically
at
home
reading
was
the
unforgivable
sin
had
my
mother
discovered
me
poring
over
the
half
intelligible
but
wholly
fascinating
story
of
adam
and
eve
and
the
devil
she
would
have
beaten
me
with
the
first
implement
to
her
hand
i
had
a
moment
terror
lest
the
possession
of
a
work
of
literature
should
be
so
horrible
a
crime
that
even
paragot
would
chastise
me
to
my
consternation
he
thrust
the
tattered
thing
it
was
an
antiquated
sixpenny
edition
under
my
nose
and
commanded
me
to
read
man
first
disobedience
go
on
if
you
can
read
it
intelligently
i
pay
your
mother
if
you
ca
i
write
to
her
politely
to
say
that
i
resent
having
my
washing
sent
home
by
persons
of
no
education
i
began
in
great
fear
but
having
i
suppose
an
instinctive
appreciation
of
letters
i
mouthed
the
rolling
lines
not
too
brokenly
what
a
heavenly
muse
asked
paragot
as
soon
as
i
paused
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
do
you
think
it
a
paradisiacal
back
yard
where
they
keep
the
horse
of
the
apocalypse
i
caught
a
twinkle
in
the
blue
eyes
which
he
bent
fiercely
upon
me
if
you
please
sir
said
i
i
think
it
is
the
bird
of
paradise
then
we
both
laughed
and
paragot
bidding
me
sit
on
the
wreck
of
a
chair
gave
me
my
first
lesson
in
greek
mythology
he
talked
for
nearly
an
hour
and
i
ragged
urchin
of
the
london
streets
my
wits
sharpened
by
hunger
and
sat
on
my
comfortless
perch
while
he
unfolded
the
tale
of
gods
and
goddesses
and
unveiled
olympus
before
my
enraptured
vision
boy
said
he
suddenly
can
you
cook
a
herring
i
came
down
to
earth
with
a
bang
stunned
i
stared
at
him
i
distinctly
remember
wondering
where
i
was
can
you
cook
a
herring
he
shouted
yes
sir
i
cried
jumping
to
my
feet
then
cook
two
one
for
you
and
one
for
me
you
find
them
somewhere
about
the
room
also
tea
and
bread
and
butter
and
a
and
when
all
is
ready
let
me
know
he
settled
himself
comfortably
in
bed
and
went
on
reading
his
book
it
was
hegel
philosophy
of
history
i
tried
to
read
it
afterwards
and
found
that
it
passed
my
understanding
in
a
confused
dream
of
gods
and
herrings
i
set
about
my
task
heaven
only
knows
how
i
managed
to
succeed
in
my
childish
imagination
jupiter
was
clothed
in
the
hirsute
majesty
of
paragot
and
i
was
to
breakfast
with
him
the
herrings
and
a
pipe
shared
a
plate
on
the
top
of
the
ricketty
chest
of
drawers
i
had
to
blow
the
ash
off
the
fish
a
paper
of
tea
and
a
loaf
of
bread
i
found
in
a
mixture
of
clothes
books
and
papers
my
godlike
friend
had
carelessly
put
his
into
the
butter
the
condition
of
the
sole
cooking
utensil
warred
even
against
my
sense
of
the
fitness
of
gridirons
and
i
cleansed
it
with
his
towel
since
then
i
have
breakfasted
in
the
houses
of
the
wealthy
i
have
lunched
at
the
café
anglais
i
have
dined
at
the
savoy
but
never
have
i
eaten
never
till
they
give
me
a
welcoming
banquet
in
the
elysian
fields
shall
i
eat
so
ambrosial
a
meal
as
that
first
herring
with
paragot
when
i
had
set
it
on
the
little
deal
table
he
deigned
to
remember
my
existence
and
closing
his
book
rose
donned
a
pair
of
trousers
and
sat
down
he
gave
me
my
first
lesson
in
boy
said
he
if
you
wish
to
adorn
the
high
social
spheres
for
which
you
are
destined
you
must
learn
the
value
of
convention
bread
and
and
asparagus
and
the
leaves
of
an
artichoke
are
eaten
with
the
fingers
but
not
herrings
or
sweetbreads
or
ice
cream
as
regards
the
last
you
are
doubtless
in
the
habit
of
extracting
it
from
a
disappointing
with
your
tongue
this
in
is
regarded
as
bad
form
is
french
a
language
which
you
will
have
to
learn
its
great
use
is
in
talking
to
english
people
when
you
do
want
them
to
understand
what
you
say
they
pretend
they
do
for
they
are
too
vain
to
admit
their
ignorance
the
wise
man
profits
by
the
vanity
of
his
if
i
were
not
wise
after
this
manner
should
i
be
here
eating
herrings
in
tavistock
street
covent
garden
i
was
too
full
of
food
and
adoration
to
reply
i
gazed
at
him
dumbly
worshipping
and
choked
over
a
cup
of
tea
when
i
recovered
he
questioned
me
as
to
my
home
life
my
schooling
my
ideas
of
a
future
state
and
my
notions
of
a
career
in
this
world
the
height
of
my
then
ambition
was
to
keep
a
shop
the
restaurateur
with
whom
my
good
mother
dealt
used
to
sit
for
hours
in
his
doorway
in
drury
lane
reading
a
book
and
i
considered
this
a
most
dignified
and
scholarly
avocation
when
i
made
this
naïve
avowal
to
paragot
he
looked
at
me
with
a
queer
pity
in
his
eyes
and
muttered
an
exclamation
in
a
foreign
tongue
i
have
never
met
anyone
so
full
of
strange
oaths
as
paragot
as
to
my
religious
convictions
they
were
chiefly
limited
to
a
terrifying
conception
of
the
hell
to
which
my
mother
daily
consigned
me
in
devils
fires
chains
and
pitchforks
its
establishment
was
as
complete
as
any
depicted
by
orcagna
i
used
to
wake
up
of
nights
in
a
cold
sweat
through
dreaming
of
it
my
son
said
paragot
the
most
eminent
divines
of
the
church
of
england
will
tell
you
that
a
material
hell
with
consuming
flames
is
an
exploded
fallacy
i
can
tell
you
the
same
without
being
an
eminent
divine
the
wicked
carry
their
own
hell
about
with
them
during
life
here
somewhere
between
the
gullet
and
the
pit
of
the
stomach
and
it
prevents
their
enjoyment
of
herrings
which
smell
vilely
of
gas
there
ai
no
devils
then
i
asked
mille
no
he
shouted
have
i
been
exhausting
myself
with
telling
you
so
i
said
little
but
to
this
day
i
remember
the
thrilling
sense
of
deliverance
from
a
horror
which
had
gone
far
to
crush
the
little
childish
joy
allowed
me
by
circumstance
there
was
no
fiery
hell
no
pincers
no
eternal
frizzling
and
sizzling
of
the
flesh
like
unto
that
of
the
fish
in
samuel
paragot
had
transformed
me
by
a
word
into
a
happy
young
pagan
my
eyes
swam
as
i
swallowed
my
last
bit
of
bread
and
butter
what
is
your
name
asked
paragot
augustus
sir
augustus
what
smith
i
murmured
same
as
mother
i
was
forgetting
said
he
now
if
there
is
one
name
i
dislike
more
than
smith
it
is
augustus
i
have
been
thinking
of
a
very
nice
name
for
you
it
is
asticot
it
expresses
you
better
than
augustus
smith
it
is
a
very
good
name
sir
said
i
politely
i
learned
soon
after
that
it
is
a
french
word
meaning
the
little
grey
worms
which
fishermen
call
gentles
and
that
it
was
not
such
a
complimentary
appellation
as
i
had
imagined
but
asticot
i
became
and
asticot
i
remained
for
many
a
year
wash
up
the
things
my
little
asticot
said
he
and
afterwards
we
will
discuss
future
arrangements
according
to
his
directions
i
took
the
tray
down
to
a
kind
of
scullery
on
the
floor
below
the
wet
plates
and
cups
i
dried
on
a
greasy
rag
which
i
found
lying
on
the
sink
and
this
seemed
to
me
a
refinement
of
luxurious
living
for
at
home
when
we
did
wash
plates
we
merely
held
them
under
the
tap
till
the
remains
of
food
ran
off
and
we
never
thought
of
drying
them
when
i
returned
to
the
bedroom
paragot
was
dressed
for
the
day
his
long
lean
wrists
and
hands
protruded
far
through
the
sleeves
of
an
old
brown
jacket
he
wore
a
grey
flannel
shirt
and
an
old
bit
of
black
ribbon
done
up
in
a
bow
by
way
of
a
tie
his
slouch
hat
once
black
was
now
green
with
age
and
his
boots
were
innocent
of
blacking
but
my
eyes
were
dazzled
by
a
heavy
gold
watch
chain
across
his
waistcoat
and
i
thought
him
the
most
glorious
of
betailored
beings
my
little
asticot
said
he
would
you
like
to
forsake
your
gentle
mother
and
your
dreams
of
a
shop
and
enter
my
service
i
the
heir
of
all
the
ages
am
driven
by
destiny
to
running
the
lotus
club
downstairs
we
call
it
because
we
eat
tripe
to
banish
memory
the
members
meet
together
in
order
to
eat
tripe
drink
beer
and
hear
me
talk
you
can
eat
tripe
and
hear
me
talk
too
and
that
will
improve
both
your
mind
and
your
body
while
cherubino
the
waiter
teaches
you
how
to
be
a
scullion
i
will
instruct
you
in
philosophy
the
sofa
in
the
club
will
make
an
excellent
bed
for
you
and
your
wages
will
be
eighteen
pence
a
week
he
thrust
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
and
rattling
his
money
looked
at
me
with
an
enquiring
air
i
returned
his
gaze
for
a
while
lost
in
a
delirious
wonder
i
tried
to
speak
something
stuck
in
my
throat
i
broke
into
a
blubber
and
dried
my
eyes
with
my
knuckles
it
was
an
intoxicated
little
asticot
that
trotted
by
his
side
to
my
mother
residence
there
over
the
bargain
was
struck
my
mother
pocketed
and
with
shaky
unaccustomed
fingers
signed
her
name
across
a
at
the
foot
of
a
document
which
paragot
had
drawn
up
i
believe
each
of
them
was
convinced
that
they
had
executed
a
legal
deed
my
mother
after
inspecting
me
critically
for
a
moment
wiped
my
nose
with
the
piece
of
sacking
that
served
as
her
apron
and
handed
me
over
to
paragot
who
marched
away
with
his
purchase
as
proud
as
if
i
had
been
a
piece
of
furniture
picked
up
cheap
i
may
as
well
remark
here
that
paragot
was
not
his
real
name
neither
was
josiah
henkendyke
by
which
he
was
then
known
to
me
he
had
a
harmless
mania
for
names
and
i
have
known
him
use
half
a
dozen
but
that
of
paragot
which
he
assumed
later
as
his
final
alias
is
the
one
with
which
he
is
most
associated
in
my
mind
and
to
avoid
confusion
i
must
call
him
that
from
the
start
indeed
looking
backward
down
the
years
i
wonder
how
he
could
ever
have
been
anything
else
than
paragot
that
phoebus
apollo
could
once
have
borne
the
name
of
john
jones
is
unimaginable
boy
said
he
as
we
retraced
our
steps
to
tavistock
street
you
are
my
thing
my
chattel
my
no
slave
of
old
belonged
more
completely
to
a
citizen
you
will
address
me
as
yes
sir
said
i
master
he
shouted
or
or
or
according
to
the
language
you
are
speaking
now
do
you
understand
yes
master
said
i
he
nodded
approval
at
the
corner
of
a
he
stopped
short
and
held
me
at
arm
length
you
are
a
horrible
object
my
little
asticot
said
he
i
must
clothe
you
in
a
manner
befitting
the
lotus
club
he
ran
me
into
a
and
fitted
me
out
in
sundry
garments
in
which
although
they
were
several
sizes
too
large
for
me
i
felt
myself
clad
like
solomon
in
all
his
glory
then
we
went
home
on
the
way
up
to
his
room
he
paused
at
the
scullery
a
dishevelled
woman
was
tidying
up
housekeeper
said
he
allow
me
to
present
you
our
new
scullion
pupil
kindly
instruct
him
in
his
duties
feed
him
and
wash
his
head
also
please
remember
that
he
answers
to
the
name
of
asticot
he
swung
on
his
heel
and
went
downstairs
humming
a
tune
i
remained
with
housekeeper
who
carried
out
his
instructions
zealously
i
can
feel
the
soreness
on
my
scalp
to
this
day
thus
it
fell
out
that
i
quitted
the
maternal
roof
and
entered
the
service
of
paragot
i
never
saw
my
mother
again
as
she
died
soon
afterwards
and
as
my
brood
of
brothers
and
sisters
vanished
down
the
diverse
gutters
of
london
i
found
myself
with
paragot
for
all
my
family
and
now
that
i
have
arrived
at
an
age
when
a
man
can
look
back
dispassionately
on
his
past
it
is
my
pride
that
i
can
lay
my
hand
on
my
heart
and
avow
him
to
be
the
best
family
that
boy
ever
had
chapter
ii
the
lotus
club
was
the
oddest
society
i
have
met
the
premises
consisted
of
one
long
dingy
room
with
two
dingy
windows
the
furniture
of
a
long
table
covered
with
dirty
american
cloth
a
multitude
of
wooden
chairs
an
old
sofa
two
dilapidated
and
a
frame
against
the
wall
from
which
by
means
of
clips
churchwarden
pipes
depended
stem
downwards
and
by
each
clip
was
a
label
bearing
a
name
on
the
table
stood
an
enormous
jar
of
tobacco
a
number
of
glasses
decorated
the
there
was
not
a
curtain
not
a
blind
not
a
picture
the
further
end
of
the
room
away
from
the
door
contained
a
huge
fireplace
and
on
the
wooden
mantelpiece
ticked
a
clock
during
the
daytime
it
was
an
abode
of
abominable
desolation
no
one
came
near
it
until
nine
in
the
evening
when
one
or
two
members
straggled
in
took
down
their
long
pipes
and
called
for
whisky
or
beer
the
only
alcoholic
beverages
the
club
provided
these
were
kept
in
great
barrels
in
the
scullery
presided
over
by
housekeeper
until
it
was
time
to
prepare
the
supper
when
cherubino
and
i
helped
ourselves
at
eleven
the
cloth
was
laid
from
then
till
half
past
members
came
in
considerable
numbers
at
half
past
supper
was
served
a
steaming
dish
of
tripe
furnished
the
head
of
the
table
in
front
of
paragot
and
a
cut
of
cold
beef
the
foot
there
were
generally
from
fifteen
to
thirty
present
men
of
all
classes
journalists
actors
lawyers
nondescripts
i
have
seen
one
of
her
majesty
judges
and
a
prizefighter
exchanging
views
across
the
table
a
few
attended
regularly
but
the
majority
seemed
to
be
always
they
supped
talked
smoked
and
drank
whisky
until
two
or
three
in
the
morning
and
appeared
to
enjoy
themselves
prodigiously
i
noticed
that
on
departing
they
wrung
paragot
fervently
by
the
hand
and
thanked
him
for
their
delightful
evening
i
remembered
his
telling
me
that
they
came
to
hear
him
talk
he
did
talk
sometimes
so
compellingly
that
i
would
stand
rapt
in
reverential
ecstasy
once
to
the
point
of
letting
the
potatoes
i
was
handing
round
roll
off
the
dish
on
to
the
floor
i
never
was
so
rapt
again
for
cherubino
picking
up
the
potatoes
and
following
my
frightened
exit
broke
them
over
my
head
on
the
landing
by
way
of
chastisement
the
best
barbers
do
not
use
hot
mealy
potatoes
for
the
hair
when
the
last
guest
had
departed
paragot
mounted
to
his
attic
housekeeper
and
cherubino
went
their
several
ways
each
went
several
ways
i
think
for
they
had
unchecked
command
during
the
evening
over
the
whisky
and
beer
barrels
and
i
dragging
a
bundle
of
bedclothes
from
beneath
the
sofa
went
to
bed
amid
the
fumes
of
tripe
gas
tobacco
alcohol
and
humanity
and
slept
the
sleep
of
perfect
happiness
in
the
morning
at
about
eleven
i
rose
and
prepared
breakfast
for
paragot
and
myself
which
we
ate
together
in
his
room
for
a
couple
of
hours
he
instructed
me
in
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
the
humanities
then
he
sent
me
out
into
the
street
for
air
and
exercise
with
instructions
to
walk
to
hyde
park
westminster
abbey
cathedral
whiteley
he
always
had
a
fresh
objective
for
me
and
to
bring
him
back
my
views
thereon
and
an
account
of
what
i
had
noticed
on
the
way
when
i
came
home
i
delivered
myself
into
the
hands
of
housekeeper
and
turned
scullion
again
the
plates
glasses
knives
and
forks
of
the
previous
evening
orgy
were
washed
and
cleaned
the
room
swept
and
aired
and
a
meal
cooked
for
housekeeper
and
myself
which
we
ate
at
a
corner
of
the
long
table
paragot
himself
dined
out
on
sunday
evenings
the
club
was
shut
and
as
housekeeper
did
not
make
her
appearance
on
the
sabbath
the
remains
of
saturday
supper
stayed
on
the
table
till
monday
afternoon
imagine
remains
of
tripe
thirty
six
hours
old
i
mention
this
not
because
it
is
of
any
great
interest
but
because
it
exhibits
a
certain
side
of
paragot
character
in
those
early
days
i
was
not
critical
i
lived
in
a
maze
of
delight
paragot
was
the
wonder
of
the
earth
my
bedroom
a
palace
chamber
and
the
abominable
sunday
night
smell
pervaded
my
senses
like
the
perfumes
of
all
the
arabies
my
son
said
paragot
one
morning
in
the
middle
of
a
french
lesson
from
the
first
he
was
bent
on
my
learning
the
language
my
son
i
wonder
whether
you
are
going
to
turn
out
a
young
caliban
and
after
i
have
shewn
you
the
true
divinity
of
things
return
to
your
dam
god
setebos
he
regarded
me
earnestly
with
his
light
blue
eyes
which
looked
so
odd
in
his
swarthy
face
is
there
any
hope
for
the
race
of
sycorax
as
we
had
read
the
tempest
the
day
before
i
understood
the
allusions
i
would
sooner
be
ariel
master
said
i
by
way
of
showing
off
my
learning
he
was
an
ungrateful
beggar
too
said
paragot
he
went
on
talking
but
i
heard
him
not
for
my
childish
mind
quickly
associated
him
with
prospero
and
i
wondered
where
lay
his
magic
staff
with
which
he
could
split
pines
and
liberate
tricksy
spirits
and
whether
he
had
a
beautiful
daughter
hidden
in
some
bower
of
tavistock
street
and
whether
the
cadaverous
cherubino
might
not
be
a
metamorphosed
ferdinand
he
appeared
the
embodiment
of
all
wisdom
and
power
and
yet
he
had
the
air
of
one
cheated
of
his
kingdom
he
seemed
also
to
be
of
reverential
age
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
not
yet
forty
my
attention
was
recalled
by
his
rising
and
walking
about
the
room
i
am
making
this
experiment
on
your
vile
body
my
little
asticot
said
he
to
prove
my
theory
of
education
you
have
had
so
far
as
it
goes
what
is
called
an
excellent
board
school
training
you
can
read
and
write
and
multiply
by
in
your
head
and
you
can
repeat
the
kings
of
england
if
you
had
been
fortunate
and
gone
to
a
public
school
they
would
have
stuffed
your
brain
full
of
greek
verbs
and
damned
facts
about
triangles
but
of
the
meaning
of
life
the
value
of
life
the
art
of
life
you
would
never
have
had
a
glimmering
perception
i
am
going
to
educate
you
my
little
asticot
through
the
imagination
the
intellect
can
look
after
itself
we
will
go
now
to
the
national
gallery
he
caught
up
his
hat
and
threw
me
my
cap
and
we
went
out
he
had
a
sudden
breathless
way
of
doing
things
i
am
sure
thirty
seconds
had
not
elapsed
between
the
idea
of
the
national
gallery
entering
his
head
and
our
finding
ourselves
on
the
stairs
we
went
to
the
national
gallery
i
came
away
with
a
reeling
undistinguishable
mass
of
form
and
colour
before
my
eyes
i
felt
sick
only
one
single
picture
stood
out
clear
paragot
talked
italian
art
to
my
uncomprehending
ears
all
the
way
home
now
said
he
when
he
had
settled
himself
comfortably
in
his
old
chair
again
which
of
the
pictures
did
you
like
best
why
that
particular
picture
save
that
it
is
the
supreme
art
of
a
supreme
genius
should
have
alone
fixed
itself
on
my
mind
i
do
not
know
it
has
been
one
of
the
psychological
puzzles
of
my
life
a
man
head
master
said
i
i
ca
describe
it
but
i
think
i
could
draw
it
draw
it
he
echoed
incredulously
yes
master
he
pulled
a
stump
of
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
threw
it
to
me
i
felt
luminously
certain
i
could
draw
the
head
a
curious
exaltation
filled
me
as
i
sat
at
a
corner
of
the
table
before
a
piece
of
paper
that
had
wrapped
up
tea
paragot
stood
over
me
as
i
drew
de
dieu
de
nom
de
dieu
cried
he
it
is
gian
bellini
doge
loredano
but
what
made
you
remember
that
picture
and
how
in
the
name
of
board
schools
could
you
manage
to
draw
it
he
walked
swiftly
up
and
down
the
room
de
dieu
de
nom
de
dieu
i
used
to
draw
horses
and
men
on
my
slate
at
school
said
i
modestly
paragot
filled
his
porcelain
pipe
and
walked
about
strangely
excited
suddenly
he
stopped
my
little
asticot
said
he
you
had
better
go
down
and
help
housekeeper
to
wash
up
the
dirty
plates
and
dishes
for
your
sake
what
my
soul
had
to
do
with
greasy
crockery
i
could
not
in
the
least
fathom
but
the
next
morning
paragot
gave
me
a
drawing
lesson
it
would
be
false
modesty
for
me
to
say
that
i
did
not
show
talent
since
the
making
of
pictures
is
the
means
whereby
i
earn
my
living
at
the
present
moment
the
gift
once
discovered
i
exercised
it
in
and
out
of
season
my
son
said
paragot
when
i
showed
him
a
sketch
of
housekeeper
as
she
lay
on
the
scullery
floor
one
saturday
night
unable
to
go
any
one
of
her
several
ways
i
am
afraid
you
are
an
artist
do
you
know
what
an
artist
is
i
did
he
pronounced
the
word
in
tones
of
such
deep
melancholy
that
i
felt
it
must
denote
something
particularly
depraved
it
is
the
man
who
has
the
power
of
doing
up
his
soul
in
paper
parcels
and
selling
them
at
three
halfpence
apiece
this
was
at
breakfast
one
morning
while
he
was
chipping
an
egg
only
two
eggs
furnished
forth
our
repast
and
i
was
already
deep
in
mine
he
scooped
off
the
top
of
the
shell
regarded
it
for
a
second
and
then
rose
with
the
egg
and
went
to
the
window
since
you
have
wings
you
had
better
fly
said
he
and
he
threw
it
into
the
street
my
little
asticot
he
added
resuming
his
seat
i
myself
was
once
an
artist
now
i
am
a
philosopher
it
is
much
better
he
cheerfully
attacked
his
bread
and
butter
whether
it
was
a
sense
of
his
goodness
or
my
own
greediness
that
prompted
me
i
know
not
but
i
pushed
my
half
eaten
egg
across
to
him
and
begged
him
to
finish
it
he
looked
queerly
at
me
for
a
moment
i
accept
it
said
he
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
is
offered
the
great
man
solemnly
ate
my
egg
and
pride
so
filled
my
heart
that
i
could
scarcely
swallow
a
smaller
man
than
paragot
would
have
refused
from
what
i
gathered
from
conversations
overheard
whilst
i
was
serving
members
with
tripe
and
alcohol
it
appeared
that
my
revered
master
was
a
mysterious
personage
about
eight
months
before
he
had
entered
the
then
unprosperous
club
for
the
first
time
as
a
guest
of
the
founder
and
proprietor
an
old
actor
who
was
growing
infirm
he
talked
vehemently
the
next
night
he
took
the
presidential
chair
which
he
since
occupied
to
the
club
greater
glory
but
whence
he
came
who
and
what
he
was
no
one
seemed
to
know
one
fat
man
whose
air
of
portentous
wisdom
and
insatiable
appetite
caused
me
much
annoyance
proclaimed
him
a
russian
nihilist
and
asked
me
whether
there
were
any
bombs
in
his
bedroom
another
man
declared
that
he
had
seen
him
leading
a
bear
in
the
streets
of
warsaw
his
manner
offended
me
have
you
ever
been
to
warsaw
mr
ulysses
asked
the
fat
man
ulysses
was
the
traditional
title
of
the
head
of
the
lotus
club
this
gentleman
says
he
saw
you
leading
a
bear
there
master
i
piped
wrathfully
in
my
shrill
treble
there
was
the
sudden
silence
of
consternation
all
some
five
and
twenty
laid
down
their
knives
and
forks
and
looked
at
paragot
who
rose
from
his
seat
throwing
out
his
right
hand
he
declaimed

does
anyone
know
what
that
is
a
young
fellow
at
the
end
of
the
table
said
it
was
the
opening
lines
of
the
odyssey
you
are
right
sir
said
paragot
threading
his
fingers
through
his
long
black
hair
they
tell
of
my
predecessor
in
office
the
first
president
of
this
club
who
was
a
man
of
many
wanderings
and
many
sufferings
and
had
seen
many
cities
and
knew
the
hearts
of
men
i
gentlemen
have
had
my
odyssey
and
i
have
been
to
warsaw
and
with
a
rapier
flash
of
a
glance
at
the
gentleman
who
had
accused
him
of
leading
bears
i
know
the
miserable
hearts
of
men
he
rapped
on
the
table
with
his
hammer
asticot
come
here
he
shouted
i
obeyed
trembling
if
ever
you
lift
up
your
voice
again
in
this
assembly
i
will
have
you
boiled
and
served
up
with
onion
sauce
tripe
that
you
are
and
you
shall
be
eaten
underdone
now
go
i
felt
shrivelled
to
the
size
of
a
pea
beneath
paragot
grotesqueness
ran
an
unprecedented
severity
i
was
conscious
of
the
accusing
glare
of
every
eye
in
my
blind
bolt
to
the
door
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
run
headlong
into
a
tray
of
drinks
which
cherubino
was
carrying
the
disaster
saved
the
situation
laughter
rang
out
loud
and
the
talk
became
general
the
interlude
was
forgotten
but
the
man
who
said
he
had
seen
my
master
leading
bears
in
warsaw
vanished
from
the
club
for
ever
after
the
next
morning
when
i
entered
paragot
room
to
wake
him
i
found
him
reading
in
bed
he
looked
up
from
his
book
my
little
asticot
said
he
leading
bears
is
better
than
calumny
but
indiscretion
is
worse
than
both
and
that
is
all
i
heard
of
the
matter
i
never
lifted
up
my
voice
in
the
club
again
there
was
a
curious
black
case
on
the
top
of
a
cupboard
in
his
room
which
for
some
time
aroused
my
curiosity
it
was
like
no
box
i
had
seen
before
but
one
afternoon
paragot
took
it
down
and
extracted
therefrom
a
violin
which
after
tuning
he
began
to
play
now
although
fond
of
music
i
have
never
been
able
to
learn
any
instrument
save
the
tambourine
my
highest
success
otherwise
has
been
to
finger
out
god
save
the
queen
and
we
wo
go
home
till
morning
on
the
ocarina
and
to
this
day
a
person
able
to
play
the
piano
or
the
fiddle
seems
possessed
of
an
uncanny
gift
but
in
that
remote
period
of
my
fresh
rescue
from
the
gutter
an
executant
appeared
something
superhuman
i
stared
at
him
with
stupid
open
mouth
he
played
what
i
afterwards
learned
was
one
of
brahms
hungarian
dances
his
lank
figure
and
long
hair
worked
in
unison
with
the
music
which
filled
the
room
with
a
wild
tumult
of
movement
i
had
not
heard
anything
like
it
in
my
life
it
set
every
nerve
of
me
dancing
i
suppose
paragot
found
his
interest
in
me
because
i
was
such
an
impressionable
youngster
when
at
the
abrupt
finale
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
it
i
could
scarce
stammer
a
word
he
gave
me
one
of
his
queer
kind
looks
while
he
tuned
a
string
i
still
wonder
my
son
whether
it
would
not
be
better
for
your
soul
that
you
should
go
on
scullioning
to
the
end
of
time
why
master
i
asked
mille
he
cried
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
reason
for
everything
you
learn
fast
enough
he
laughed
and
went
on
playing
and
as
i
listened
the
more
godlike
he
grew
the
streets
of
paris
said
he
returning
the
fiddle
to
its
case
are
strewn
with
the
wrecked
souls
of
artists
and
not
london
my
little
asticot
he
replied
i
am
a
frenchman
and
it
is
our
fondest
illusion
that
no
art
can
possibly
exist
out
of
paris
i
discovered
later
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
gascon
father
and
an
irish
mother
which
accounted
for
his
being
absolutely
bilingual
and
indeed
for
many
oddities
of
temperament
but
now
he
proclaimed
himself
a
frenchman
and
for
a
time
i
was
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
disappointment
at
the
board
school
i
had
bolted
enough
indigestible
historical
facts
to
know
that
the
english
had
always
beaten
the
french
and
i
had
drawn
the
natural
conclusion
that
the
french
were
a
vastly
inferior
race
of
beings
it
was
i
verily
believe
the
first
step
in
my
spiritual
education
to
realise
that
the
god
of
my
idolatry
suffered
no
diminution
of
grandeur
by
reason
of
his
nationality
indeed
he
gained
accession
for
after
this
he
talked
often
to
me
of
france
in
his
magniloquent
way
until
i
began
secretly
to
be
ashamed
of
being
english
this
had
one
advantage
in
that
i
set
myself
with
redoubled
vigour
to
learn
his
language
so
extraordinary
was
the
veneration
i
had
for
the
man
who
had
transplanted
me
from
the
kicks
and
soapsuds
of
my
former
life
into
this
bewildering
land
of
greek
gods
and
ariels
and
pictures
and
music
for
the
man
who
spoke
many
unknown
tongues
wore
a
gold
watch
chain
had
been
to
warsaw
and
every
city
mentioned
in
my
school
geography
and
presided
like
a
king
over
an
assembly
of
those
whom
as
a
gutter
urchin
i
had
been
wont
to
designate
toffs
for
the
beneficent
being
who
had
provided
me
gus
smith
alias
asticot
with
a
nightshirt
condescended
to
eat
half
my
egg
and
to
allow
me
to
supervise
his
bedchamber
and
maintain
it
in
an
orderly
state
of
disintegration
from
butter
and
from
fish
for
the
man
who
god
knows
was
the
first
of
human
creatures
to
awaken
the
emotion
of
love
within
my
breast
so
extraordinary
was
the
veneration
i
had
for
him
that
although
i
started
out
on
this
narrative
by
saying
it
was
paragot
story
and
not
my
own
i
proposed
to
tell
i
hope
to
be
pardoned
for
a
brief
egotistical
excursion
like
the
gentleman
in
chaucer
paragot
had
over
his
beddes
hedde
a
shelf
of
books
to
which
careless
creature
that
he
was
he
did
not
dream
of
denying
me
access
in
that
attic
in
tavistock
street
i
read
smollett
and
byron
and
somehow
spelt
through
nana
i
also
found
there
the
imitatione
which
i
read
with
much
the
same
enjoyment
as
i
did
the
others
you
must
not
think
this
priggish
of
me
the
impressionable
child
of
starved
imagination
will
read
anything
that
is
printed
in
my
mother
house
i
used
to
purloin
the
squares
of
newspaper
in
which
the
fried
fish
from
samuel
had
been
wrapped
and
surreptitiously
read
them
why
not
saint
thomas
à
kempis
i
have
in
my
possession
now
a
filthy
piece
of
paper
dropping
to
bits
on
which
is
copied
in
my
round
board
school
boy
handwriting
the
eleventh
chapter
of
the
it
runs
son
thou
hast
still
many
things
to
learn
which
thou
hast
not
well
learned
are
they
place
thy
desire
altogether
in
subjection
to
my
good
pleasure
and
not
to
be
a
lover
of
thyself
but
an
earnest
seeker
of
my
will
thy
desires
often
excite
and
urge
thee
forward
but
consider
with
thyself
whether
thou
art
not
more
moved
for
thine
own
objects
than
for
my
honour
if
it
is
myself
that
thou
seekest
thou
shalt
be
well
content
with
whatsoever
i
shall
ordain
but
if
any
pursuit
of
thine
own
lieth
hidden
within
thee
behold
it
is
this
which
hindreth
and
weigheth
thee
therefore
lest
thou
strive
too
earnestly
after
some
desire
which
thou
hast
conceived
without
taking
counsel
of
me
lest
haply
it
repent
thee
afterwards
and
that
displease
thee
which
before
pleased
and
for
which
thou
didst
long
as
for
a
great
good
for
not
every
affection
which
seemeth
good
is
to
be
forthwith
followed
neither
is
every
opposite
affection
to
be
immediately
avoided
sometimes
it
is
expedient
to
use
restraint
even
in
good
desires
and
wishes
lest
through
importunity
thou
fall
into
distraction
of
mind
lest
through
want
of
discipline
thou
become
a
to
others
or
lest
by
the
resistance
of
others
thou
be
suddenly
disturbed
and
brought
to
indeed
it
is
needful
to
use
violence
and
manfully
to
strive
against
the
sensual
appetite
and
not
to
consider
what
the
flesh
may
or
not
will
but
rather
to
strive
after
this
that
it
may
become
subject
however
unwillingly
to
the
spirit
and
for
so
long
it
ought
to
be
chastised
and
compelled
to
undergo
slavery
even
until
it
be
ready
for
all
things
and
learn
to
be
contented
with
little
to
be
delighted
with
things
simple
and
never
to
murmur
at
any
let
no
one
be
shocked
it
was
one
of
the
great
acts
of
devotion
of
my
life
i
copied
this
out
as
a
boy
not
because
it
counselled
me
in
my
duty
towards
god
but
because
it
summed
up
my
whole
duty
to
paragot
paragot
was
me
i
saw
the
relation
between
paragot
and
myself
in
every
line
had
not
i
often
fallen
into
distraction
of
mind
over
my
drawing
and
books
when
i
ought
to
have
been
helping
housekeeper
downstairs
was
it
not
want
of
discipline
that
made
me
a
that
memorable
night
in
the
club
ought
i
not
to
be
content
with
everything
paragot
should
ordain
and
was
it
not
my
duty
to
murmur
at
no
inconvenience
years
afterwards
i
showed
this
paper
to
paragot
he
wept
alas
i
had
not
well
chosen
my
opportunity
i
remember
the
night
after
i
copied
the
chapter
cherubino
and
i
helped
paragot
up
the
stairs
and
put
him
to
bed
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
him
the
worse
for
liquor
but
when
one
has
been
accustomed
to
see
one
mother
and
all
her
adult
acquaintances
dead
drunk
the
spectacle
of
a
god
slightly
overcome
with
wine
is
neither
here
nor
there
chapter
iii
there
was
one
merit
if
merit
it
was
of
my
mother
establishment
no
skeletons
lurked
in
cupboards
they
flaunted
their
grimness
all
over
the
place
such
letters
as
she
received
trailed
about
the
kitchen
for
all
who
chose
to
read
until
they
were
caught
up
to
cleanse
a
as
she
possessed
no
private
papers
their
sanctity
was
never
inculcated
and
i
could
have
rummaged
had
i
so
desired
in
every
drawer
or
box
in
the
house
without
fear
of
correction
when
i
took
up
my
abode
with
paragot
he
laid
no
embargo
on
any
of
his
belongings
the
attic
except
for
sleeping
purposes
was
as
much
mine
as
his
and
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
anything
it
contained
could
not
be
at
my
disposal
this
must
be
my
apologia
for
reading
in
all
innocence
but
with
much
enjoyment
some
documents
of
a
private
nature
which
i
discovered
one
day
about
a
year
after
i
had
entered
paragot
service
stuffed
by
way
of
keeping
them
together
in
an
old
woollen
stocking
they
have
been
put
into
my
possession
now
for
the
purpose
of
writing
this
narrative
so
my
original
offence
having
been
purged
i
need
offer
no
apology
for
referring
to
them
there
was
no
sort
of
order
in
the
bundle
of
documents
you
might
as
well
look
for
the
quality
of
humour
in
a
dromedary
or
of
mercy
in
a
pianist
as
that
of
method
in
paragot
i
managed
however
to
disentangle
two
main
sets
one
a
series
of
love
letters
and
the
other
disconnected
notes
of
travel
in
both
was
i
mightily
interested
the
some
of
which
were
written
in
english
and
some
in
french
were
addressed
to
a
beautiful
lady
named
joanna
i
knew
she
was
beautiful
because
paragot
himself
said
so
et
ravissante
comme
une
aube
my
dear
dream
of
english
loveliness
the
fair
flower
of
my
life
and
remarks
such
as
these
were
proof
positive
the
odd
part
of
it
was
that
they
seemed
not
to
have
been
posted
he
wrote
not
till
my
arms
are
again
around
you
will
your
beloved
eyes
behold
these
outpourings
of
my
heart
the
paper
heading
bore
the
word
paris
allusions
to
a
great
artistic
project
on
which
he
was
working
baffled
my
young
and
ignorant
curiosity
i
have
love
youth
genius
beauty
on
my
side
he
wrote
and
i
shall
conquer
we
shall
be
irresistible
fame
will
attend
my
genius
homage
your
beauty
we
shall
walk
on
roses
and
dwell
in
the
palaces
of
the
earth
my
heart
thrilled
when
i
read
these
lines
that
paragot
was
a
great
man
here
again
was
proof
i
did
not
reflect
that
this
vision
splendid
of
earth
palaces
had
faded
into
the
twilight
of
the
tavistock
street
garret
thank
heaven
we
have
had
years
of
remembered
life
before
we
learned
to
reason
i
had
many
pictures
of
my
hero
in
those
strange
letter
days
so
remote
to
my
childish
mind
he
crosses
the
channel
in
december
just
to
skulk
for
one
dark
night
against
the
railings
of
the
london
square
where
she
dwelt
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
shadow
on
the
blind
for
some
reason
which
i
could
not
comprehend
the
lovers
were
forbidden
to
meet
it
rains
he
sees
nothing
but
he
returns
to
paris
with
contentment
in
his
heart
and
a
terrible
cold
in
his
head
but
i
have
seen
the
doorstep
he
writes
tous
les
jours
ces
petits
pieds
si
i
hate
your
modern
manner
of
wooing
a
few
weeks
ago
a
young
woman
in
need
of
my
elderly
counsel
showed
me
a
letter
from
her
betrothed
he
had
been
educated
at
oxford
university
and
possessed
a
and
yet
he
addressed
her
as
old
girl
and
alluded
to
the
regular
beanfeast
they
would
have
when
they
were
married
and
the
damsel
not
only
found
nothing
wanting
in
the
missive
but
treasured
it
as
if
it
had
been
an
impapyrated
kiss
de
mon
wrote
paragot
i
have
seen
the
doorstep
which
your
little
feet
so
adored
touch
lightly
every
day
i
like
that
better
but
this
is
the
opinion
of
the
asticot
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
the
asticot
of
fourteen
could
not
contrast
for
him
sufficed
the
absolute
of
the
romance
of
paragot
yet
i
did
have
a
standard
of
comparison
ferdinand
whom
till
then
i
had
regarded
as
the
prince
of
lovers
but
he
paled
into
the
most
prosaic
young
man
before
the
newly
illuminated
paragot
and
as
for
miranda
i
sent
her
packing
from
her
throne
in
my
heart
and
joanna
reigned
in
her
stead
little
idiot
that
i
was
i
set
to
dreaming
of
joanna
you
may
not
like
the
name
but
to
me
it
held
and
still
holds
unspeakable
music
the
other
papers
as
i
have
said
were
records
of
travel
and
i
instinctively
recognized
that
they
referred
to
subsequent
days
they
were
written
on
the
backs
of
bills
in
outlandish
languages
leaves
torn
from
greasy
waste
stuff
exhaling
exotic
odours
and
odds
and
scraps
of
paper
indescribable
in
after
years
in
paris
i
besought
paragot
almost
on
my
knees
to
write
an
account
of
the
years
of
vagabondage
to
which
these
papers
refer
it
would
make
i
told
him
a
romance
compared
with
which
that
of
gil
bias
de
santillane
were
the
tale
of
wanderings
round
a
village
pump
such
said
i
is
given
to
few
men
to
produce
but
paragot
only
smiled
and
sipped
his
absinthe
it
was
against
his
principles
he
said
the
world
would
be
a
gentler
habitat
if
there
had
never
been
written
or
graven
record
of
a
human
action
and
he
refused
to
pander
to
the
obscene
curiosity
of
the
multitude
as
to
the
thoughts
and
doings
of
an
entire
stranger
besides
literary
composition
was
beset
with
too
many
difficulties
one
method
of
expression
had
always
to
be
in
evening
dress
which
he
abhorred
and
he
could
not
abide
the
violet
ink
and
pens
supplied
in
cafés
and
places
where
one
writes
so
the
world
has
lost
a
new
odyssey
the
notes
formed
reading
as
disconnected
as
a
dictionary
they
were
so
abrupt
incidents
were
noted
which
stimulated
my
young
imagination
like
and
then
nothing
more
as
soon
as
hedwige
had
taught
me
german
she
grew
sick
and
tired
of
me
and
when
she
wanted
to
marry
an
of
cavalry
with
moustaches
reaching
to
the
top
of
his
who
tried
to
run
me
through
the
body
when
he
saw
such
a
scarecrow
walking
out
with
her
i
left
cassel
and
that
was
all
i
learned
with
regard
to
cassel
hedwige
save
from
two
other
notes
or
his
learning
the
german
tongue
the
following
note
is
the
only
one
he
thought
worth
while
to
make
of
a
journey
through
russia
novotorshakaya
is
a
beastly
hole
trou
the
bugs
are
the
most
companionable
creatures
in
it
and
they
are
the
cleanest
at
prague
he
scribbles
on
a
sheet
of
paper
stained
with
rings
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
polite
burglar
who
introduced
me
to
his
lady
wife
and
to
other
courteous
criminals
their
spouses
and
families
my
slight
knowledge
of
czech
which
i
had
by
this
time
acquired
enabled
me
to
take
vast
pleasure
in
their
society
granted
their
sociological
premises
based
on
proudhon
they
are
too
logical
the
lack
of
imaginative
power
to
break
away
from
convention
is
a
serious
defect
in
their
character
they
take
their
gospel
of
est
too
seriously
i
do
not
inordinately
sympathise
with
people
who
get
themselves
hanged
for
a
principle
and
that
is
what
my
friend
mysdrizin
did
an
old
lady
of
prague
obstinate
as
the
old
sometimes
are
on
whom
he
called
professionally
disputed
his
theories
whereupon
instead
of
smiling
with
the
indulgence
of
one
who
knows
the
art
of
living
and
letting
her
have
her
own
way
he
convinced
her
with
a
his
widow
like
her
predecessor
of
ephesus
desiring
speedy
consolation
i
fled
the
city
my
epicureanism
and
her
individualism
would
have
clashed
i
had
played
the
battle
of
prague
quatre
sufficiently
in
my
tender
childhood
i
had
no
wild
yearning
to
recommence
here
is
another
verona
there
is
no
date
none
of
these
jottings
bear
a
date
and
when
i
last
saw
paragot
he
had
not
the
patience
to
arrange
these
far
off
memories
verona
to
me
the
word
recalls
immemorable
associations
vistas
of
narrow
old
streets
redolent
of
the
renaissance
echoing
still
with
brawl
and
clash
of
arms
and
haunted
by
the
general
stock
in

the

lodged
with
the
cheeriest
little
undertaker
in
the
world
who
had
a
capital
practice
his
wife
four
children
and
whoever
happened
to

were
all
pressed
into
the
merry
service
we
sang
as
we
drove

when
i

again
i
shall
sing
that
refrain
it
has
an
unisonal
value
that
is
positively
captivating
had
it
not
been
that
a
diet
of
spaghetti
and
anæmic
wine
a
of
unparalleled
virulence
undermined
my
constitution
and
that
the
four

whose
bedroom
i
shared
all
took
at
once
and
thus
robbed
me
of
sleep
i
might
have
been
to
the
tune
of
to
the
present
day
here
and
there
were
jottings
of
figures
i
know
now
they
refer
to
paragot
tiny
patrimony
on
which
he
and
i
in
after
years
subsisted
it
was
so
small
that
no
wonder
he
worked
now
and
then
for
a
living
wage
i
also
see
now
as
of
course
i
could
not
be
expected
to
see
then
that
paragot
being
a
creature
of
extremes
would
either
have
the
highest
or
the
lowest
in
these
as
he
can
not
go
to
grand
hotels
i
find
him
avoiding
like
the
commercial
or
family
hostelries
where
he
will
foregather
with
the
the
the
the
offence
of
them
is
too
rank
for
his
spirit
the
pretending
simian
class
aping
the
vices
of
the
rich
and
instinct
with
the
vices
of
the
low
and
frank

as

do
mind
he
writes
on
a

sheet
apropos
of

the
frank
dunghill
outside
a
german
peasant
kitchen
window
it
is
a
matter
of
family
pride
the
higher
it
can
be
piled
the
greater
his
consideration
but
what
i
loathe
and
abominate
is
the
dungheap
hidden
beneath
hedwige
draper
papa
parlour
floor
when
i
came
to
this
in
my
wrongful
search
through
paragot
papers
i
felt
greatly
relieved
i
thought
hedwige
had
seduced
him
from
his
allegiance
to
joanna
and
that
he
was
sorry
she
had
married
the
sergeant
with
moustaches
reaching
to
his
though
what
part
of
his
person
his
was
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
i
pictured
hedwige
as
a
gigantic
lady
the
name
somehow
conveyed
the
idea
to
me
it
was
peculiarly
comforting
to
learn
that
she
was
a
horrid
girl
whose
papa
had
a
draper
shop
over
a
dunghill
i
no
longer
bothered
my
head
concerning
her
for
soon
i
came
across
a
reference
to
joanna
i
was
lounging
one
day
in
the
puerta
del
sol
that
swarming
central
parallelogram
of
madrid
and
musing
on
the
possibilities
of
progress
in
a
nation
which
contents
itself
with
in
the
heart
of
its
capital
when
a
carriage
drove
past
me
in
which
i
can
almost
still
swear
i
saw
joanna
it
entered
the
calle
de
san
hieronimo
i
started
in
racing
pursuit
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
a
soldier
to
avoid
arrest
as
a
madman
or
a
murderer
for
no
sane
man
runs
in
spain
i
leaped
into
a
fiacre
and
gave
such
chase
as
tomorrow
victim
of
the
would
allow
we
came
up
with
the
carriage
on
the
prado
just
in
time
to
see
the
skirts
of
a
lady
vanish
through
the
door
of
a
house
i
dismissed
my
cab
and
waited
i
waited
two
solid
hours
that
attracted
no
attention
everyone
waits
in
spain
to
stand
interminably
at
a
street
corner
is
to
take
out
a
patent
of
respectability
but
my
confounded
heart
beat
wildly
i
had
an
to
see
her
again
i
addressed
the
liveried
coachman
in
my
best
spanish
taking
off
my
hat
and
bowing
low
will
you
have
the
great
goodness
to
tell
me
who
is
that
lady
he
replied
with
equal
urbanity
is
not
correct
for
coachmen
to
give
rapscallions
information
as
to
their
employers
your
señora
bids
the
rapscallion
sit
beside
her
in
the
carriage
and
orders
you
to
drive
you
will
regret
your
insolence
said
i
i
turned
a
haughty
back
on
him
but
i
felt
his
lackey
eye
fixed
disapprovingly
on
my
rags
will
hear
the
sound
said
i
to
myself
her
silvery
english
voice
or
i
will
die
then
the
door
opened
and
the
beautiful
lady
entered
the
carriage
it
was
not
the
gods
were
without
bowels
of
compassion
for
me
that
day
another
scrap
contains
the
following
thus
have
i
come
to
the
end
of
a
five
years
vagabondage
i
started
out
as
a
pilgrim
to
the
inner
shrine
of
truth
which
i
have
sought
from
petersburg
to
lisbon
from
taormina
to
christiania
i
have
lived
in
a
spiritual
shadowland
dreaming
elusive
dreams
my
better
part
stayed
by
the
fitful
vision
of
things
unseen
such
an
exquisite
has
never
man
undertaken
before
or
since
the
dear
knight
of
la
mancha
and
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
know
what
the
deuce
i
have
been
after
save
that
instead
of
pursuing
i
have
all
the
time
been
running
away
in
my
next
quest
i
must
not
proclaim
my
dulcinea
too
loudly
when
hedwige
little
sister
came
to
me
with
a
doll
into
which
hedwige
had
savagely
run
hatpins
so
that
the
stuffing
came
out
i
consoled
the
weeping
infant
with
a
new
doll
and
the
assurance
that
hedwige
was
the
spitefullest
cat
as
yet
evolved
from
a
feline
sex
i
had
no
notion
at
the
time
of
the
reason
for
hedwige
viciousness
but
now
i
fancy
she
must
have
acted
according
to
mediæval
superstition
and
used
the
doll
as
joanna
hated
effigy
i
remember
that
the
next
time
i
saw
her
i
criticised
her
straight
teutonic
fringe
and
fanfaronaded
on
the
captivating
frizziness
of
joanna
hair
the
wonder
is
that
hedwige
did
not
run
hatpins
into
the
murderer
widow
of
prague
was
built
of
sterner
stuff
she
cared
not
a
hempen
strand
for
joanna
a
pale
consumptive
doxy
according
to
her
picturing
who
had
jilted
me
for
an
eminent
in
london
i
spent
many
happy
hours
over
these
scraps
building
up
the
fantastic
fairy
tale
of
paragot
antecedents
and
should
have
gone
on
reading
them
for
an
indefinite
time
had
not
paragot
one
day
discovered
me
it
was
then
that
i
learned
the
sacrosanctity
of
private
papers
i
thought
my
little
asticot
said
he
bending
his
blue
eyes
on
me
i
thought
you
were
a
gentleman
only
paragot
could
have
had
so
crazy
a
thought
i
could
not
be
a
gentleman
i
reflected
till
i
had
a
gold
however
paragot
expected
me
to
be
one
without
the
seal
and
token
of
outward
adornments
and
i
promised
faithfully
to
mould
myself
according
to
his
expectations
how
much
of
this
nightmare
farrago
have
you
read
i
know
it
all
by
heart
master
said
i
he
took
off
his
old
hat
and
threw
it
on
the
bed
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
perplexedly
my
son
said
he
at
last
if
you
were
just
a
common
boy
i
should
make
you
go
on
your
bended
knees
and
lift
up
your
hand
and
swear
that
you
would
not
reveal
to
a
living
soul
the
mysteries
which
these
papers
contain
and
then
i
should
send
you
to
dwell
for
ever
among
the
but
i
see
before
me
a
gentleman
a
scholar
and
an
artist
and
i
will
not
submit
him
to
such
an
indignity
he
put
his
hand
on
my
head
and
looked
at
me
in
kind
irony
i
will
never
tell
no
one
master
i
promised
anyone
he
corrected
anyone
master
i
repeated
meekly
you
will
wipe
it
all
out
of
your
memory
i
was
habitually
truthful
with
paragot
because
he
never
gave
me
cause
to
lie
i
ca
master
said
i
thinking
of
my
dreams
of
joanna
the
seriousness
of
my
tone
amused
him
what
has
made
such
an
indelible
impression
on
your
mind
i
ca
forget
i
blurted
out
moved
both
by
reluctance
to
yield
over
my
dreams
of
joanna
and
by
a
desire
to
show
off
my
familiarity
with
french
i
ca
forget
about
petits
pieds
si
the
smile
died
from
his
face
which
assumed
a
queer
scared
expression
he
went
to
the
window
and
stood
there
so
long
that
i
in
my
turn
grew
scared
i
realised
dimly
what
i
had
done
and
i
could
have
bitten
my
tongue
out
i
drew
near
him
master
said
i
timidly
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
presently
he
picked
up
his
hat
from
the
bed
and
walked
out
without
taking
any
notice
of
me
we
did
not
refer
to
the
papers
again
until
long
afterwards
and
though
they
lay
unguarded
as
before
in
the
old
stocking
never
till
this
present
day
have
i
set
my
eyes
on
them
chapter
iv
one
may
morning
a
year
after
my
surprising
of
paragot
secret
i
awoke
later
than
usual
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
marking
eleven
and
huddling
on
my
clothes
in
alarm
i
left
the
foul
smelling
club
room
and
ran
upstairs
to
arouse
my
master
to
my
astonishment
he
was
not
alone
a
stout
florid
man
wearing
a
white
waistcoat
which
bellied
out
like
the
sail
of
a
racing
yacht
a
frock
coat
and
general
resplendency
of
garb
stood
planted
in
the
middle
of
the
room
while
paragot
still
in
nightshirt
but
trousered
sat
swinging
his
leg
on
a
corner
of
the
deal
table
i
noticed
the
fiddle
which
paragot
had
evidently
been
playing
before
his
visitor
arrival
lying
on
the
disordered
bed
who
the
devil
is
this
cried
the
fat
man
angrily
this
is
asticot
my
private
secretary
who
cooks
my
herrings
and
attends
to
my
correspondence
usually
he
cooks
two
but
if
you
will
join
us
at
breakfast
hogson
pogson
bawled
the
fat
man
i
beg
your
pardon
said
my
master
sweetly
if
you
will
join
us
at
breakfast
he
will
cook
three
damn
your
breakfast
said
pogson
only
two
then
asticot
this
gentleman
has
already
breakfasted
you
will
forgive
us
for
not
treating
you
as
a
stranger
pogson
who
was
in
a
rage
thumped
the
table
with
his
hand
i
give
you
to
understand
henkendyke
that
i
am
the
proprietor
of
this
club
i
have
bought
it
with
my
money
and
i
not
going
to
see
it
go
to
eternal
glory
as
it
doing
under
your
management
i
not
like
that
old
ass
ballantyne
i
a
business
man
and
i
going
to
run
this
club
for
a
profit
and
if
you
continue
to
be
manager
you
jolly
well
have
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
my
good
friend
said
my
master
rising
and
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
you
have
told
me
that
about
ten
times
it
is
getting
monotonous
the
way
this
place
is
run
continued
pogson
unheeding
is
scandalous
not
a
blessed
account
kept
no
check
on
provisions
or
drink
every
night
your
servants
are
drunk
as
owls
said
paragot
and
what
the
dickens
do
you
do
i
give
the
lotus
club
the
prestige
of
my
presidency
i
accept
a
salary
and
this
presidential
residence
as
my
remuneration
you
do
not
expect
a
man
like
me
to
keep
ledgers
and
check
butcher
bills
like
a
twopennyhalfpenny
clerk
in
the
city
it
is
you
my
dear
pogson
who
have
curious
ideas
of
club
management
you
should
put
this
sort
of
thing
into
the
hands
of
some
arithmetical
hireling
i
he
waved
his
long
fingers
tipped
with
their
long
nails
magnificently
am
the
picturesque
the
intellectual
the
spiritual
guide
of
the
club
you
are
a
fraud
cried
pogson
using
so
dreadful
an
adjective
that
i
dropped
the
gridiron
paragot
had
trained
me
to
a
distaste
of
foul
language
you
are
a
drunken
incompetent
thief
paragot
took
his
guest
glossy
silk
hat
and
gold
mounted
cane
from
the
table
and
put
them
into
his
hands
he
pointed
to
the
door
get
out
quickly
said
he
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
sitting
on
the
bed
began
to
play
the
fiddle
pogson
instead
of
getting
out
stood
in
front
of
him
quivering
like
an
infuriated
jelly
and
informed
him
that
it
was
his
blooming
club
and
his
blooming
room
that
he
would
choose
the
moment
of
exit
most
convenient
to
his
own
blooming
self
also
that
paragot
speedy
exit
was
a
matter
for
his
decision
in
a
dancing
fury
he
heaped
abuse
on
paragot
who
played
the
last
rose
of
summer
with
rather
more
tremolo
than
usual
even
i
saw
that
he
was
dangerous
pogson
did
not
heed
suddenly
paragot
sprang
to
his
feet
towering
over
the
fat
man
and
swung
his
fiddle
on
high
like
thor
hammer
with
a
splitting
crash
it
came
down
on
pogson
head
then
paragot
gripped
him
and
running
with
him
to
the
door
shot
him
down
the
stairs
that
my
little
asticot
said
he
is
the
present
proprietor
of
the
lotus
club
and
this
is
the
late
manager
i
ran
to
the
door
for
the
purpose
of
locking
it
paragot
smiled
he
will
not
come
back
when
he
has
mended
what
fluellen
calls
his
coxcomb
he
will
take
out
a
summons
against
me
for
assault
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
while
i
in
trembling
bewilderment
prepared
the
breakfast
presently
he
broke
into
a
loud
laugh
the
fool
the
mammonite
fool
asticot
does
he
think
that
are
picked
up
by
the
hundred
among
the
smug
young
men
of
the
polytechnic
who
add
up
figures
and
keep
books
by
double
entry
do
you
know
what
double
entry
is
no
master
said
i
from
my
squatting
seat
on
the
floor
by
the
gas
stove
thank
the
gods
for
your
ignorance
it
is
a
nescience
whereby
human
aspirations
are
cribbed
within
ruled
lines
and
made
to
balance
on
the
opposite
side
would
you
like
to
see
me
obey
mammon
behest
and
crib
my
aspirations
within
ruled
lines
no
master
said
i
the
gods
have
given
you
understanding
said
he
which
is
better
than
by
double
entry
at
the
time
i
thought
my
master
attitude
magnificent
and
i
despised
pogson
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
but
since
then
i
have
wondered
how
the
deuce
the
lotus
club
survived
a
month
of
paragot
management
in
after
years
when
i
questioned
him
he
said
airily
that
he
left
all
financial
questions
to
ballantyne
the
old
actor
proprietor
who
had
grown
infirm
and
that
he
was
president
and
not
manager
yet
to
my
certain
knowledge
he
paid
wages
to
housekeeper
cherubino
and
myself
and
as
for
tradesmen
bills
they
were
strewn
about
bedchamber
like
the
autumn
leaves
of
vallombrosa
in
greater
numbers
than
the
articles
of
his
attire
on
the
other
hand
i
have
no
recollection
of
moneys
coming
in
there
must
have
been
some
loose
unbusinesslike
arrangement
between
ballantyne
and
himself
which
most
justifiably
shocked
the
business
instincts
of
pogson
there
i
sympathise
with
the
latter
but
i
must
admit
that
he
showed
a
want
of
tact
in
dealing
with
paragot
my
master
was
in
gay
spirits
during
breakfast
when
he
had
finished
he
declared
the
meal
to
be
the
most
enjoyable
he
had
eaten
in
tavistock
street
my
insensate
conceit
regarded
the
statement
as
a
tribute
to
my
culinary
skill
and
i
glowed
with
pride
i
informed
him
that
my
herring
cookery
was
nothing
to
what
i
could
do
with
sprats
my
little
asticot
said
he
filling
his
porcelain
pipe
i
have
to
offer
you
my
joint
congratulation
and
commiseration
i
congratulate
you
on
your
being
no
longer
a
scullion
i
commiserate
with
you
on
the
loss
of
your
salary
of
eighteen
pence
a
week
your
sensitive
spirit
would
revolt
against
taking
service
under
anyone
of
mammon
myrmidons
and
even
if
it
did
i
am
sure
he
would
not
employ
you
like
caliban
no
longer
will
you
trencher
nor
wash
dish
at
least
in
the
lotus
club
for
from
this
hour
i
dismiss
you
from
its
service
he
smoked
silently
in
his
wicker
chair
giving
me
time
to
realise
the
sudden
change
in
my
fortunes
then
only
did
i
understand
i
saw
myself
for
a
desolate
moment
cast
motherless
rudderless
on
the
wide
world
where
art
and
scholarship
met
with
contumely
and
undergrown
youth
was
buffeted
and
despised
my
gorgeous
dreams
were
at
an
end
the
blighting
commonplace
overspread
my
soul
what
would
you
like
to
do
my
little
asticot
he
asked
i
pulled
myself
together
and
looked
at
him
heroically
i
could
be
a
butcher
boy
the
corners
of
my
mouth
twitched
it
was
a
shuddersome
avocation
and
the
prospect
of
the
companionship
of
other
butcher
boys
who
could
not
draw
did
not
know
french
and
had
never
heard
of
joanna
filled
me
with
a
horrible
sense
of
doom
suddenly
paragot
leaped
up
in
his
wild
way
to
his
feet
and
clapped
me
so
heartily
on
the
shoulder
that
i
staggered
my
son
cried
he
i
have
an
inspiration
it
is
spring
and
the
hedgerows
are
greener
than
the
pavement
and
the
high
roads
of
europe
are
wider
than
tavistock
street
we
will
seek
them
asticot
mon
i
be
don
quixote
and
you
be
my
sancho
and
we
go
again
in
quest
of
adventures
he
laughed
aloud
and
shook
me
like
a
little
rat
te
tape
dans
mon
petit
asticot
without
waiting
for
me
to
reply
he
rushed
to
the
ricketty
washstand
poured
out
water
from
the
broken
ewer
and
after
washing
began
to
dress
in
feverish
haste
talking
all
the
time
used
as
i
was
to
his
suddenness
my
wits
could
not
move
fast
enough
to
follow
him
then
i
need
be
a
butcher
boy
i
said
at
last
he
paused
in
the
act
of
drawing
on
a
boot
butcher
boy
do
you
want
to
be
a
butcher
boy
no
master
said
i
fervently
then
what
are
you
talking
of
he
had
evidently
not
heard
my
answer
to
his
question
i
am
going
to
educate
you
in
the
high
school
of
the
earth
the
university
of
the
universe
and
you
shall
see
a
cow
and
a
dandelion
and
before
then
you
will
be
disastrously
seasick
the
sea
i
cried
in
delirious
amazement
we
are
going
on
the
sea
where
are
we
going
to
france
he
cried
why
are
you
not
getting
ready
to
go
there
i
might
have
answered
that
i
had
no
personal
preparations
to
make
but
feeling
rebuked
for
idleness
while
he
was
so
busy
i
began
to
clear
away
the
breakfast
things
he
stopped
me
de
we
are
not
going
to
travel
with
cups
and
saucers
he
dragged
from
the
top
of
the
cupboard
an
incredibly
dirty
carpet
bag
of
huge
dimensions
and
decayed
antiquity
and
bade
me
pack
therein
our
belongings
the
process
was
not
a
lengthy
one
we
had
so
few
when
we
had
little
more
than
half
filled
the
bag
with
articles
of
attire
and
the
toilette
stuffed
in
we
looked
around
for
ballast
the
books
master
said
i
we
will
take
the
immortal
works
of
maître
françois
rabelais
and
the
dirty
little
edition
of
copperfield
the
remainder
of
the
library
we
will
sell
in
holywell
street
and
the
violin
he
picked
up
the
maimed
instrument
and
after
looking
at
it
critically
threw
it
into
a
corner
for
pogson
said
he
when
we
had
tied
up
the
books
with
a
piece
of
stout
string
providentially
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
cupboard
our
preparations
were
complete
paragot
donned
his
cap
and
a
inverness
cape
grasped
the
carpet
bag
and
looked
round
the
room
said
he
and
i
followed
with
the
books
we
gained
the
street
and
left
the
lotus
club
behind
us
for
ever
what
housekeeper
said
what
cherubino
said
what
the
members
said
when
they
found
no
ulysses
presiding
at
the
supper
table
that
evening
what
pogson
said
when
he
learned
that
his
assailant
had
shaken
the
dust
of
the
lotus
club
from
off
his
feet
and
strolled
into
the
wide
world
without
giving
him
the
opportunity
of
serving
a
summons
for
assault
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
nor
have
i
learned
who
succeeded
paragot
as
president
and
occupied
the
palatial
chamber
of
all
the
harmonies
that
was
paragot
squalid
attic
when
in
after
years
i
returned
to
london
the
lotus
club
had
passed
from
human
memory
and
at
the
present
day
a
perky
set
of
office
premises
stands
on
its
site
the
morality
of
paragot
precipitate
exodus
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
discuss
from
his
point
of
view
the
fact
of
having
disliked
the
new
proprietor
from
their
first
interview
and
broken
a
fiddle
over
his
head
rendered
his
position
as
president
untenable
paragot
walked
out
after
having
sold
the
books
for
a
few
shillings
in
holywell
street
we
marched
up
fleet
street
into
the
city
and
entered
a
stupendous
unimagined
building
which
paragot
informed
me
was
his
bank
elegant
gentlemen
behind
the
counter
shovelled
gold
to
and
fro
with
the
same
casual
indifference
as
i
had
seen
grocers
assistants
shovel
tea
one
of
them
a
gorgeous
fellow
wearing
a
white
piqué
tie
and
a
pin
paid
such
deference
to
paragot
that
i
went
out
prodigiously
impressed
by
my
master
importance
i
was
convinced
that
he
owned
the
establishment
and
during
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
i
could
not
speak
to
him
for
awe
it
was
about
two
when
we
reached
victoria
station
there
paragot
discovered
for
the
first
time
that
there
was
not
a
train
till
nine
in
the
evening
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
trains
did
not
start
for
paris
at
quarter
of
an
hour
intervals
during
the
day
my
son
said
he
now
is
the
time
to
make
practical
use
of
our
philosophy
instead
of
heaping
vain
maledictions
on
the
railway
company
let
us
deposit
our
luggage
in
the
cloak
room
and
take
a
walk
on
the
thames
embankment
we
walked
thither
and
sat
on
a
vacant
bench
beside
the
needle
it
was
a
warm
may
afternoon
my
young
mind
and
body
fired
by
the
excitements
of
the
day
found
rest
in
the
sunny
idleness
it
was
delicious
to
be
here
instead
of
washing
up
plates
and
dishes
with
housekeeper
paragot
took
off
his
old
slouch
hat
stretched
himself
easefully
and
sighed
i
am
anxious
to
get
to
paris
to
consult
henri
quatre
who
is
henri
quatre
master
i
asked
henri
quatre
is
on
the
pont
neuf
that
is
a
french
saying
which
means
that
queen
anne
is
dead
he
was
a
great
king
of
france
and
his
statue
on
horseback
is
in
the
middle
of
a
great
bridge
across
the
seine
called
the
pont
neuf
he
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
i
will
tell
you
a
story
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
in
paris
a
magnificent
young
man
who
thought
himself
a
genius
he
a
genius
my
little
asticot
a
genius
is
a
man
who
writes
immortal
books
paints
immortal
pictures
rears
immortal
buildings
and
commits
immortal
follies
do
be
a
genius
my
son
it
is
good
for
anybody
well
this
young
man
was
clad
in
purple
and
fine
linen
and
fared
sumptuously
every
day
he
also
had
valuable
furniture
one
evening
something
happened
to
annoy
him
paragot
paused
what
annoyed
him
i
asked
a
flaw
in
what
he
had
conceived
to
be
the
scheme
of
the
universe
replied
my
master
it
annoys
many
people
the
young
man
being
annoyed
cast
the
fruits
of
his
genius
into
the
fire
tore
up
his
purple
and
fine
linen
and
smashed
his
furniture
with
a
crusader
mace
which
happened
to
be
hanging
by
way
of
an
ornament
on
the
wall
it
made
of
steel
with
a
knob
full
of
spikes
and
weighs
about
nine
pounds
i
know
nothing
like
it
for
destroying
a
louis
quinze
table
or
for
knocking
the
works
out
of
a
clock
if
you
good
my
son
you
shall
have
one
when
you
grow
up
i
looked
gratefully
at
him
not
content
with
his
kindness
to
me
then
he
would
be
my
benefactor
still
when
i
reached
manhood
the
young
man
then
packed
a
valise
full
of
necessaries
and
went
out
into
the
street
it
was
a
rainy
november
evening
he
walked
along
the
quays
through
the
drizzle
till
he
came
to
the
statue
of
henri
quatre
the
pont
neuf
was
alive
with
traffic
and
the
swiftly
passing
lights
of
vehicles
threw
conflicting
gleams
over
the
wet
statue
the
flickered
in
the
wind
paragot
flickered
his
long
fingers
dramatically
to
illustrate
the
on
all
sides
rose
vague
masses
of
building
the
louvre
away
beyond
the
bridge
the
frowning
mass
of
the
conciergerie
the
towering
turrets
of
notre
dame
swelling
like
billows
against
the
sky
pale
reflections
came
from
the
river
do
you
see
the
picture
my
little
asticot
and
the
young
man
clutched
the
railings
that
surround
the
plinth
of
the
statue
and
caught
sight
of
the
face
of
henri
quatre
and
henri
quatre
looked
at
him
so
kindly
that
he
said
bon
you
are
of
the
south
like
myself
i
am
leaving
paris
to
go
into
the
wide
world
but
i
do
know
where
in
the
wide
world
to
go
to
the
king
nodded
his
head
and
pointed
to
the
gare
de
and
the
young
man
took
off
his
hat
and
said
bon
i
thank
you
he
went
to
the
gare
de
lyon
and
found
a
train
just
starting
for
italy
so
he
went
to
italy
i
have
a
great
respect
for
henri
quatre
and
what
happened
to
him
then
master
i
asked
after
a
breathless
pause
he
became
a
vagabond
philosopher
replied
paragot
refilling
his
porcelain
pipe
no
argument
has
ever
been
able
to
convince
paragot
that
the
statue
did
not
nod
its
head
and
point
the
way
to
italy
for
some
years
i
myself
believed
it
but
at
last
it
became
obvious
that
the
flashing
gleams
of
light
over
the
wet
statue
had
made
him
the
victim
of
a
trick
of
the
eyes
i
think
the
only
serious
offence
i
ever
gave
paragot
was
when
i
presented
to
him
this
solution
of
the
mystery
varied
discourse
and
a
meal
in
a
strand
filled
up
the
hours
till
nine
and
then
i
started
for
wonderland
with
paragot
we
stayed
in
paris
but
two
days
when
i
asked
my
master
why
our
sojourn
was
not
longer
he
said
something
about
the
of
it
which
i
could
not
understand
i
have
only
two
clear
memories
of
paris
he
took
me
to
see
henri
quatre
and
explained
how
the
statue
nodded
and
how
the
hand
which
held
the
reins
lifted
and
pointed
to
the
gare
de
lyon
what
more
conclusive
proof
of
his
veracity
need
i
have
than
actual
confrontation
with
henri
quatre
the
other
scene
fixed
on
my
mind
is
a
narrow
dark
street
with
tall
houses
on
either
side
an
awning
outside
a
humble
café
a
little
table
beneath
it
at
which
paragot
and
myself
were
seated
i
sipped
luxuriously
a
celestial
liquor
which
i
have
since
learned
was
grenadine
syrup
and
water
in
front
of
paragot
was
a
curious
opalescent
milky
fluid
of
which
he
drank
great
quantities
during
those
two
days
and
ever
afterwards
the
time
has
come
said
he
rolling
his
eyes
at
me
with
an
awful
solemnity
and
speaking
in
a
thick
voice
the
time
has
come
to
talk
of
affairs
first
let
me
impress
on
you
that
henkendyke
is
an
appellation
offensive
to
french
ears
henceforward
my
name
is
pradel
polydore
pradel
and
as
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
have
an
i
hereby
adopt
you
as
my
son
your
name
is
therefore
asticot
pradel
i
hope
you
like
it
you
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
have
a
father
now
the
possession
of
a
father
is
a
privilege
to
which
every
human
being
has
a
right
i
polydore
pradel
confer
on
you
that
privilege
my
son
he
raised
his
glass
clinked
it
against
mine
and
pledged
me
henceforward
said
paragot
what
is
good
enough
for
me
will
i
hope
not
be
good
enough
for
you
and
what
is
too
bad
for
me
shall
never
be
your
portion
i
swear
it
by
the
devil
that
dwells
in
this
entrancing
but
execrated
form
of
alcohol
he
finished
his
drink
and
called
for
another
as
soon
as
the
absinthe
had
curdled
with
the
dropping
water
he
filled
up
the
glass
and
drank
it
off
then
he
sat
for
a
long
time
in
bemused
silence
while
i
perched
on
my
chair
reflected
on
his
great
goodness
and
wondered
how
i
should
help
him
up
the
darksome
stairs
of
our
hotel
without
the
aid
of
cherubino
the
next
day
we
started
on
our
pilgrimage
why
we
went
in
one
direction
more
than
another
why
we
went
to
one
place
rather
than
to
another
neither
he
nor
i
could
tell
i
never
questioned
sometimes
we
wandered
for
days
on
foot
sleeping
in
village
inns
or
occasionally
under
a
hedge
when
the
nights
were
warm
sometimes
we
spent
two
or
three
days
in
an
old
world
town
and
paragot
would
show
me
cathedrals
and
churches
and
lecture
me
on
the
history
of
the
place
and
set
me
to
sketch
bits
of
the
picturesque
that
took
his
fancy
in
the
cool
exquisite
cloister
of
the
chateau
of
jacques
coeur
at
bourges
i
learned
more
of
the
history
of
charles
vii
than
any
english
boy
of
my
generation
in
the
chateau
of
blois
the
salamanders
of
françois
premier
the
statue
of
diane
de
poictiers
the
poison
cabinet
of
catherine
de
medici
the
dungeons
of
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
became
living
testimonies
of
the
past
under
paragot
imaginative
teaching
he
had
set
his
heart
on
educating
me
suddenly
as
the
original
impulse
had
seized
him
yet
it
lasted
strong
and
became
the
object
of
his
disordered
and
otherwise
aimless
life
books
we
always
had
in
plenty
tattered
classics
are
cheap
enough
in
france
and
what
mattered
it
if
pages
were
missing
when
done
with
we
threw
them
away
we
might
have
been
tracked
through
the
country
like
the
hares
in
a
paper
chase
by
the
trail
of
literature
we
left
behind
us
in
spite
of
his
unmethodical
temperament
paragot
made
one
fixed
rule
for
my
habits
in
towns
and
larger
villages
i
went
to
bed
at
nine
what
he
did
with
himself
by
way
of
amusement
in
the
evenings
i
never
knew
nor
did
it
occur
to
me
to
conjecture
healthily
tired
after
a
happy
day
i
was
only
too
glad
to
crawl
to
whatever
queer
resting
place
chance
provided
and
to
sleep
the
sound
sleep
of
boyhood
to
be
for
ever
moving
amid
a
fairyland
of
novelty
to
have
no
care
for
the
morrow
to
have
no
tasks
save
those
that
were
a
delight
to
be
under
the
protecting
guidance
of
a
godlike
being
whose
very
reproofs
were
couched
in
terms
of
humorous
kindness
to
eat
strange
unexpected
things
to
fraternise
in
a
new
tongue
which
daily
grew
more
familiar
with
any
urchin
on
the
or
city
byway
to
pass
wondering
days
among
country
sights
and
country
sounds
to
be
in
short
the
perfect
vagabond
could
boy
dream
of
a
more
glorious
life
now
and
again
a
whimsy
seized
my
master
and
he
declared
that
we
must
work
and
earn
our
daily
bread
by
the
sweat
of
our
brows
at
a
farm
near
chartres
we
hired
ourselves
out
to
an
elderly
couple
monsieur
and
madame
dubosc
and
spent
toilsome
but
healthy
days
carting
manure
although
paragot
wrought
miracles
with
his
pitchfork
i
do
think
monsieur
dubosc
took
him
seriously
peasant
shrewdness
penetrated
to
the
gentleman
beneath
paragot
blouse
and
peasant
ignorance
attributed
to
him
the
riches
which
he
did
not
possess
they
became
great
friends
however
and
before
we
left
he
succeeded
in
establishing
himself
as
a
kind
of
oracle
by
curing
a
pig
of
some
mysterious
disease
by
means
of
a
remedy
which
he
said
he
had
learned
in
dalmatia
old
madame
dubosc
shed
tears
when
we
left
la
haye
sometimes
paragot
grew
tired
of
tramping
and
we
travelled
by
rail
in
the
wooden
third
class
compartments
of
omnibus
trains
that
stopped
at
every
station
now
and
then
pure
chance
took
us
to
any
particular
town
it
was
at
nancy
that
paragot
went
to
the
ticket
office
and
said
with
the
utmost
politeness
monsieur
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
give
me
a
ticket
to
what
destination
asked
the
clerk
peering
through
his
pigeon
hole
said
paragot
to
any
destination
you
like
provided
it
is
not
too
expensive
the
clerk
called
him
a
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
but
paragot
protested
pardon
monsieur
i
have
but
one
wish
to
get
away
from
nancy
i
have
seen
the
episcopal
palace
on
the
place
stanislas
the
cathedral
and
i
have
viewed
but
i
have
not
read
the
thousand
volumes
in
the
university
library
you
know
the
places
one
gets
to
from
nancy
which
i
do
not
i
am
a
stranger
in
your
hands
if
you
could
suggest
to
me
a
town
about
kilometres
distant
there
is
longwy
said
the
haughty
official
then
have
the
kindness
to
give
me
two
third
class
tickets
to
longwy
said
paragot
and
to
longwy
we
went
paragot
contemplated
the
lack
of
interest
in
the
smug
little
town
to
hold
out
longwy
as
a
goal
to
the
enthusiastic
pilgrim
to
the
shrine
of
truth
said
he
could
only
enter
the
mind
of
a
french
railway
official
the
record
of
our
wanderings
would
mark
the
stages
of
my
own
development
but
would
be
of
little
count
as
a
history
of
paragot
we
tramped
and
trained
south
through
italy
and
spent
the
winter
in
rome
then
it
entered
his
head
to
obtain
employment
for
both
of
us
as
workman
and
boy
on
the
excavations
of
the
forum
we
lived
in
the
slums
with
our
brother
excavators
and
were
completely
happy
so
happy
that
though
we
wandered
the
next
year
over
france
and
part
of
germany
the
winter
again
found
us
working
in
rome
in
the
following
spring
we
set
our
faces
northward
and
in
july
destiny
overtook
us
in
savoy
chapter
v
it
was
the
late
afternoon
of
a
sweltering
july
day
the
near
hills
slumbered
in
the
sunshine
far
away
beyond
them
grey
peaks
of
alpine
spurs
patched
with
snow
rose
in
faint
outline
against
the
sky
the
valley
lay
in
rich
idleness
green
and
gold
and
fruitful
yielding
itself
with
a
maternal
largeness
to
the
white
fifteenth
century
château
on
the
hillside
a
long
white
road
stretched
away
to
the
left
following
the
convolutions
of
the
valley
until
it
became
a
thread
on
the
right
it
turned
sharply
by
a
clump
of
trees
which
marked
a
farm
in
the
middle
of
it
all
in
the
grateful
shadow
cast
by
a
wayside
café
sat
paragot
and
myself
watching
with
thirsty
eyes
the
buxom
but
slatternly
pour
out
beer
from
a
bottle
a
dirty
mongrel
terrier
lapped
water
from
an
earthenware
bowl
at
the
foot
of
the
wooden
table
at
which
we
sat
this
was
narcisse
a
recent
member
of
our
vagabond
family
whom
my
master
had
casually
adopted
some
weeks
before
and
had
christened
according
to
some
a
non
principle
of
his
own
i
think
he
was
the
least
beautiful
dog
i
have
ever
met
but
i
loved
him
dearly
paragot
drained
his
tumbler
handed
it
back
to
be
refilled
drained
it
again
and
cleared
his
throat
with
the
contentment
of
a
man
whose
thirst
has
been
slaked
now
one
can
spit
he
exclaimed
heartily
that
is
always
a
comfort
to
a
man
remarked
the
it
is
the
potentiality
that
is
the
comfort
have
you
apartments
for
the
night
madame
they
are
for
for
gentlemen
said
the
patronne
diffidently
narcisse
having
also
finished
his
draught
stretched
himself
out
on
the
ground
his
chin
on
his
fore
paws
and
glanced
furtively
upwards
at
the
disparaging
lady
de
cried
paragot
are
we
not
gentlemen
you
are
of
the
midi
cried
the
woman
recognising
the
expletive
for
no
one
born
north
of
avignon
says
de
i
too
am
from
marseilles
my
husband
was
a
savoyard
that
is
why
i
am
here
i
am
a
gentleman
of
gascony
said
my
master
and
this
is
my
son
asticot
it
is
a
droll
name
said
the
we
are
commercial
travellers
on
our
rounds
with
samples
of
philosophy
it
is
a
droll
trade
said
the
we
were
greasy
and
dirty
sunburnt
to
the
colour
of
egyptian
felaheen
and
dressed
in
the
peasant
blue
blouse
creatures
more
unlike
professors
of
philosophy
could
not
be
conceived
but
the
seemed
to
be
impressed
as
who
was
not
by
paragot
the
rooms
will
be
three
francs
monsieur
she
said
after
a
calculating
pause
i
engage
them
said
my
master
asticot
aid
madame
to
take
our
luggage
up
to
our
bedchambers
i
grasped
my
bundle
and
handed
dilapidated
canvas
gripsack
to
the
he
arrested
her
one
moment
madame
as
you
see
my
portmanteau
contains
a
shirt
a
pair
of
socks
a
comb
and
a
toothbrush
also
a
copy
of
the
works
of
the
divine
vagrant
maître
françois
villon
which
i
will
take
out
at
once
he
was
a
thief
and
a
reprobate
and
got
nearer
hanged
than
any
man
who
ever
lived
and
he
is
the
dearest
friend
i
have
you
have
droll
friends
remarked
the
continuing
her
litany
and
to
think
that
he
died
four
hundred
years
ago
sighed
my
master
is
it
strange
madame
that
all
the
bravest
men
and
most
beautiful
women
are
those
that
are
dead
the
landlady
laughed
you
talk
like
a
true
gascon
monsieur
in
this
country
people
are
so
silent
that
one
loses
the
use
of
one
tongue
i
departed
with
her
to
see
after
domestic
arrangements
and
when
i
returned
i
found
paragot
smoking
his
porcelain
pipe
and
talking
to
a
dusty
child
in
charge
of
a
goat
having
at
that
period
a
soul
above
dusty
children
in
charge
of
goats
i
sprawled
on
the
ground
beside
narcisse
and
being
tired
by
the
day
tramp
fell
into
a
doze
the
good
earth
when
you
have
a
casing
of
it
already
on
clothes
and
person
is
a
comfortable
couch
but
i
think
you
must
be
in
your
teens
to
enjoy
it
i
awoke
to
the
sound
of
paragot
voice
talking
to
narcisse
the
goat
child
had
slipped
away
an
ox
cart
laden
with
hay
lumbered
past
the
mellowness
of
late
afternoon
lay
over
the
land
the
shadow
cast
by
the
little
white
café
had
deepened
gradually
far
beyond
the
table
from
within
the
house
came
the
faint
clatter
of
footsteps
and
cooking
utensils
paragot
was
still
smoking
narcisse
sat
on
his
haunches
his
ill
shaped
head
to
one
side
and
his
ears
cocked
after
making
a
vicious
dig
at
a
flea
he
yawned
and
trotted
about
after
the
manner
of
his
kind
in
search
of
adventure
paragot
summoned
him
back
my
good
narcisse
every
spot
on
the
earth
has
its
essential
quality
which
the
wise
man
or
dog
knows
how
to
enjoy
in
its
entirety
in
great
cities
where
life
is
pulsating
around
you
you
are
alert
for
the
unexpected
the
underlying
principle
of
a
world
backwater
like
this
is
restful
stagnation
here
you
must
wallow
in
the
uneventful
in
vain
you
sniff
around
in
quest
of
the
exciting
mistaking
like
your
fellow
in
the
fable
the
shadow
for
the
substance
the
substance
here
is
rest
here
nothing
ever
happens
pardon
monsieur
said
a
voice
close
upon
us
is
it
very
far
to
chambéry
it
does
not
matter
said
a
second
voice
following
hard
on
the
first
for
i
can
go
no
further
i
jumped
to
my
feet
and
my
master
started
round
in
his
chair
the
first
speaker
was
a
girl
the
second
an
old
man
she
had
merely
the
comeliness
of
tanned
and
peasant
youth
he
was
wizened
lined
browned
and
bent
a
cotton
umbrella
shaded
the
girl
bare
head
and
she
carried
in
her
hand
a
cane
valise
covered
with
grey
canvas
the
old
man
was
burdened
with
two
ancient
shabby
cases
one
evidently
containing
a
violin
and
the
other
some
queerly
shaped
musical
instrument
both
the
new
comers
were
wayworn
and
dirty
and
my
master
seeing
suffering
on
the
old
man
face
rose
and
courteously
offered
him
a
chair
sit
down
and
rest
said
he
and
mademoiselle
you
are
thinking
of
going
to
chambéry
but
it
is
nearly
a
day
journey
on
foot
we
have
to
play
at
a
wedding
tomorrow
monsieur
said
the
girl
piteously
it
was
arranged
two
months
ago
and
we
must
get
there
in
some
manner
there
is
a
railway
station
not
far
off
said
i
alas
we
have
only
ten
sous
in
the
world
which
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
our
tickets
she
answered
imagine
monsieur
i
had
a
piece
of
twenty
francs
in
my
pocket
this
morning
and
i
went
to
the
station
to
get
a
ticket
for
i
had
counted
on
going
by
railway
as
my
grandfather
is
so
ill
and
when
i
came
to
pay
i
found
i
had
lost
my
louis
how
the
only
knows
it
is
desolating
monsieur
we
had
to
walk
so
as
to
keep
our
engagement
at
chambéry
if
we
miss
it
sommes
dans
la
purée
pour
tout
de
to
be
in
the
is
to
be
in
a
very
bad
mess
indeed
the
prospect
of
abject
pennilessness
filled
the
damsel
eyes
with
woe
you
earn
your
living
by
playing
at
weddings
for
folks
to
dance
asked
my
master
yes
monsieur
my
grandfather
plays
the
violin
and
i
the
zither
we
also
go
to
fairs
in
the
winter
we
play
at
cafés
in
large
towns
life
is
hard
monsieur
is
it
not
she
closed
her
umbrella
and
laid
it
on
the
valise
the
old
man
sat
by
the
table
his
head
resting
on
his
hands
saying
nothing
when
i
think
of
my
good
louis
that
is
gone
she
added
tragically
the
only
feature
making
for
charm
in
a
coarse
homely
face
was
a
set
of
white
even
teeth
i
found
her
singularly
unattractive
a
tear
rolled
down
her
cheek
and
its
course
was
that
of
a
rill
in
a
dusty
plain
suppose
i
lend
you
the
money
for
the
railway
tickets
said
my
master
kindly
o
monsieur
she
cried
i
should
thank
you
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
she
turned
to
the
old
man
who
ashen
faced
was
staring
in
front
of
him
monsieur
will
lend
us
enough
money
to
get
to
chambéry
i
can
go
no
further
he
murmured
then
his
eyelids
quivered
his
body
moved
spasmodically
and
he
swayed
sideways
off
the
chair
on
to
the
ground
we
rushed
to
aid
him
the
girl
put
his
head
on
her
lap
my
master
bade
me
run
into
the
café
for
brandy
when
i
returned
the
old
man
was
dead
narcisse
sat
placidly
by
with
his
tongue
out
eyeing
his
master
ironically
you
are
the
man
his
glance
implied
who
said
that
nothing
happens
here
i
have
known
many
dogs
in
my
life
but
never
so
mocking
and
cynical
a
dog
as
narcisse
it
was
nearly
midnight
before
my
master
and
i
sat
down
again
outside
the
café
the
intervening
hours
had
been
spent
in
journeying
to
and
from
the
nearest
village
and
obtaining
the
necessary
services
of
doctor
and
curé
my
master
was
smoking
his
porcelain
pipe
as
usual
but
strangely
silent
a
faint
circle
of
light
came
from
the
open
window
of
the
café
the
white
road
gleamed
dimly
and
beyond
the
hushed
valley
the
hills
loomed
vague
against
a
black
starlit
sky
in
the
lighted
room
a
few
peasants
from
neighbouring
farms
drank
their
sour
white
wine
and
discussed
the
death
in
low
voices
in
other
circumstances
my
master
would
have
joined
them
under
pretext
of
getting
nearer
the
heart
of
life
and
would
have
told
them
amazing
tales
of
ekaterinoslav
or
valladolid
till
they
reeled
home
drunk
with
wine
and
wonder
and
i
should
have
been
abed
but
paragot
seemed
to
prefer
the
silent
company
of
narcisse
and
myself
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
asticot
he
asked
at
length
of
what
master
death
it
frightens
me
was
all
i
could
answer
what
i
resent
about
it
said
my
master
reflectively
is
that
one
is
not
able
to
have
any
personal
concern
in
the
most
interesting
event
in
one
career
if
you
could
even
follow
your
own
funeral
and
have
a
chance
of
weeping
for
yourself
you
are
never
so
important
as
when
you
are
a
corpse
and
you
miss
it
all
i
have
a
good
mind
not
to
die
it
is
either
the
silliest
or
the
wisest
action
of
one
life
i
wonder
which
presently
the
girl
came
down
the
passage
of
the
café
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
and
seeing
paragot
advanced
to
the
table
you
are
very
kind
monsieur
she
said
and
for
what
you
have
done
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
it
was
very
little
said
my
master
asticot
why
do
you
not
give
mademoiselle
your
chair
your
manners
are
worse
than
those
of
narcisse
mademoiselle
do
me
the
pleasure
of
being
seated
she
sat
down
her
feet
apart
peasant
fashion
her
hands
in
her
lap
if
i
had
not
lost
the
twenty
francs
he
would
not
have
died
she
said
dejectedly
he
would
have
died
if
you
had
brought
him
here
in
a
carriage
he
had
aneurism
of
the
heart
the
doctor
says
he
might
have
died
any
moment
the
last
ten
years
how
old
was
he
seventy
eighty
ninety
how
should
i
know
but
he
was
your
grandfather
ah
no
indeed
monsieur
she
replied
in
a
more
animated
manner
he
was
not
a
relative
my
mother
was
poor
and
she
sold
me
to
him
three
years
ago
why
that
is
like
me
master
i
cried
vastly
interested
my
son
said
he
in
english
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
must
be
forgotten
and
then
mademoiselle
he
asked
in
french
then
he
taught
me
to
play
the
zither
and
to
dance
i
am
sorry
he
is
dead
oui
par
exemple
but
i
do
not
weep
for
him
as
for
a
grandfather
oh
no
and
your
mother
she
died
last
year
so
i
am
all
alone
he
asked
her
what
she
thought
of
doing
for
her
livelihood
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
the
resignation
of
her
class
i
can
always
earn
my
living
there
are
brasseries
in
all
the
towns
i
am
fairly
well
known
they
will
give
me
an
engagement
faut
passer
par
là
comme
les
you
must
go
through
it
like
the
others
repeated
my
master
but
you
are
very
young
my
poor
child
i
am
eighteen
monsieur
i
know
i
shall
not
make
a
fortune
i
am
not
pretty
enough
even
when
i
paint
and
my
figure
is
heavy
that
is
what
père
paragot
used
to
complain
of
what
was
his
name
asked
my
master
pricking
up
his
ears
berzélius
paragot
and
he
took
the
name
of
nibbidard
which
means
luck
so
he
loved
to
call
himself
berzélius
nibbidard
paragot
berzélius
nibbidard
paragot
mouthed
my
master
joyously
i
would
give
anything
for
a
name
like
that
it
is
yours
if
you
like
to
take
it
she
said
quite
seriously
no
one
will
want
it
any
more
little
asticot
of
my
heart
said
he
what
do
you
think
of
it
it
struck
me
as
a
most
aristocratically
romantic
appellation
i
was
used
to
his
aliases
by
this
time
he
had
long
ceased
to
call
himself
pradel
and
what
was
our
surname
for
the
moment
i
am
now
unable
to
recollect
you
look
like
master
said
i
and
in
an
inexplicable
way
he
did
as
i
have
before
remarked
he
called
me
a
psychometrical
genius
and
enquired
the
name
of
the
young
lady
amélie
duprat
monsieur
she
said
but
le
we
must
have
professional
names
for
the
cafés
père
paragot
called
me
de
veau
delicious
cried
he
so
everyone
calls
me
blanquette
she
explained
gravely
there
was
a
silence
paragot
he
really
assumed
the
name
from
this
moment
refilled
his
pipe
the
belated
peasants
having
finished
their
wine
clattered
out
of
the
café
and
took
off
their
hats
as
they
passed
us
life
is
very
hard
is
it
not
messieurs
remarked
blanquette
it
seemed
to
be
her
favourite
philosophic
proposition
she
sighed
if
père
paragot
had
only
lived
to
play
at
the
wedding
tomorrow
what
then
i
should
have
had
ten
francs
ah
said
my
master
first
i
lose
my
louis
and
now
i
lose
my
ten
francs
ah
vierge
de
miséricorde
it
was
sometimes
they
received
more
than
the
stipulated
fee
at
these
village
weddings
they
passed
the
hat
round
if
the
guests
were
mellow
with
good
wine
which
makes
folks
generous
they
often
earned
double
the
amount
and
they
always
had
as
much
as
they
liked
to
eat
and
could
take
away
scraps
in
a
handkerchief
and
good
wholesome
nourishment
monsieur
once
it
was
half
a
goose
and
now
there
was
nothing
nothing
blanquette
did
not
believe
in
the
any
longer
she
buried
her
face
in
her
arms
and
wept
paragot
smoked
helplessly
for
a
few
moments
i
unused
to
women
tears
felt
the
desolation
of
the
race
of
blanquette
de
veau
overspread
me
but
that
i
considered
it
to
be
beneath
my
dignity
as
a
man
i
should
have
wept
too
suddenly
paragot
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
and
started
to
his
feet
blanquette
lifted
a
scared
wet
face
dimly
seen
in
the
half
light
de
dieu
cried
he
if
you
hold
so
much
to
your
ten
francs
and
half
a
goose
i
myself
will
come
with
you
to
chambéry
tomorrow
and
fiddle
at
the
wedding
you
monsieur
she
gasped
yes
i
why
not
do
you
think
i
ca
scrape
catgut
as
well
as
père
paragot
he
walked
to
and
fro
declaring
his
musical
powers
in
his
boastful
way
if
he
chose
he
could
rip
out
the
hearts
of
a
dead
municipal
council
with
a
violin
and
could
set
a
hospital
for
paralytics
he
would
have
fiddled
the
children
of
hamelin
away
from
the
pied
piper
did
blanquette
believe
him
but
yes
monsieur
she
said
fervently
ask
asticot
my
faith
in
him
was
absolute
to
my
mind
he
had
even
understated
his
abilities
the
experience
of
the
disillusioning
years
has
since
caused
me
to
modify
my
opinions
but
paragot
boastfulness
has
not
lessened
him
in
my
eyes
and
this
leads
to
a
curious
reflection
when
a
gascon
boasts
you
love
him
for
it
when
a
prussian
does
it
your
toes
tingle
to
kick
him
to
berlin
his
very
whimsical
braggadocio
made
paragot
adorable
and
i
am
at
a
loss
to
think
what
he
would
have
been
without
it
of
course
said
he
if
you
are
proud
if
you
do
want
to
be
seen
in
the
company
of
a
scarecrow
like
me
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
blanquette
humbly
repudiated
the
charge
of
pride
her
soul
was
set
on
her
ten
francs
and
she
did
care
how
she
got
them
she
accepted
monsieur
generous
offer
out
of
a
full
heart
that
sense
said
my
master
we
shall
rehearse
at
daybreak
chapter
vi
dawn
found
us
all
in
a
field
some
distance
from
the
café
paragot
blanquette
narcisse
the
zither
the
fiddle
and
i
and
while
the
two
musicians
rehearsed
the
jingly
waltzes
and
polkas
that
made
up
the
old
man
répertoire
i
tried
to
explain
the
situation
to
narcisse
who
sat
with
his
ears
cocked
wondering
what
the
deuce
all
the
noise
was
about
ah
monsieur
said
blanquette
during
a
pause
you
play
like
a
great
artist
did
i
tell
you
so
he
cried
triumphantly
you
must
have
studied
much
prodigiously
said
he
père
paragot
had
played
the
violin
for
sixty
years
but
he
could
not
make
it
sing
like
that
you
would
not
compare
père
paragot
with
my
master
i
exclaimed
by
way
of
rebuke
blanquette
acquiesced
humbly
when
one
hears
monsieur
one
has
the
devil
in
one
body
listen
to
this
said
the
delighted
paragot
jumping
on
to
his
feet
and
tucking
the
fiddle
beneath
his
chin
and
there
in
the
pure
dawn
with
nothing
but
god
sky
and
green
fields
around
us
he
played
gounod
ave
maria
putting
into
his
execution
all
his
imaginative
fervour
and
accentuating
the
tremolo
passages
in
a
vibrating
ecstasy
which
to
blanquette
uncultured
soul
was
the
very
passion
of
music
i
have
since
learned
that
the
greatest
violinists
do
not
overemphasise
the
tremolo
ah
dieu
it
is
beautiful
she
murmured
is
it
cried
paragot
and
it
touches
your
heart
my
little
blanquette
eh
we
are
all
artists
together
i
monsieur
she
laughed
and
ran
her
hands
over
the
zither
strings
i
ought
to
be
at
work
in
the
fields
so
père
paragot
used
to
say
i
make
no
progress
i
am
as
stupid
as
a
goose
two
hours
afterwards
we
started
for
chambéry
as
odd
a
procession
as
ever
gave
food
for
a
gaiety
from
the
old
grey
valise
carried
the
previous
day
by
blanquette
she
had
produced
much
property
finery
a
black
velveteen
jacket
resplendent
with
velveteen
tied
with
ribbons
at
the
knees
and
a
rakish
alpine
hat
with
a
feather
adorned
my
master
person
his
own
disreputable
heavy
boots
and
a
pair
of
grey
worsted
stockings
may
not
have
formed
a
fastidious
finish
to
the
costume
but
in
my
eyes
he
looked
magnificent
towards
the
transfiguration
of
blanquette
a
pandora
box
could
not
have
effected
more
she
was
attired
in
a
short
skirt
a
white
moderately
fresh
a
kind
of
italian
and
scarlet
stockings
enormous
gilt
swung
from
her
ears
a
cable
of
blue
beads
encircled
her
neck
her
lips
were
dyed
pomegranate
her
eyes
darkened
and
her
cheeks
touched
with
rouge
a
pair
of
substantial
gilt
shoes
slung
over
her
shoulders
clinked
their
heels
together
as
she
walked
narcisse
barked
his
ecstatic
admiration
around
this
beauteous
creature
and
had
i
been
a
dog
i
should
have
barked
mine
too
my
dignity
as
a
man
only
allowed
me
to
cast
sidelong
glances
at
her
and
hope
that
she
would
soon
put
on
the
gilt
shoes
as
for
my
master
on
beholding
her
he
doffed
his
hat
and
saluted
her
with
a
fantastic
compliment
whereat
the
girl
blushed
and
turned
her
head
away
motley
the
only
wear
my
son
he
cried
gaily
in
this
cap
and
bells
i
see
life
under
a
different
aspect
never
has
it
appeared
to
me
sweeter
and
more
irresponsible
do
you
feel
it
but
i
forgot
you
have
any
motley
i
apologise
for
my
want
of
tact
blanquette
he
added
in
french
why
have
you
found
a
costume
for
asticot
blanquette
replied
in
her
way
that
she
had
any
they
walked
on
together
and
i
dropped
behind
suddenly
realising
my
pariahdom
i
wondered
whether
these
magnificent
beings
would
be
ashamed
of
my
company
when
we
arrived
at
chambéry
i
pictured
myself
sitting
lonesome
with
narcisse
in
the
while
they
revelled
in
their
splendour
and
the
of
the
child
overcame
me
master
said
i
dismally
what
shall
narcisse
and
i
do
while
you
are
at
the
wedding
he
wheeled
round
and
regarded
me
and
i
knew
by
the
light
in
his
eyes
that
an
inspiration
was
taking
shape
behind
them
i
buy
you
a
red
shirt
and
pomade
your
hair
and
you
shall
be
one
of
us
my
son
and
go
round
with
the
hat
i
exulted
obviously
now
the
dog
will
feel
out
of
it
said
he
perplexed
i
will
consult
blanquette
do
you
think
we
could
shave
narcisse
and
make
him
think
a
poodle
that
would
be
impossible
monsieur
replied
blanquette
gravely
as
narcisse
was
enjoying
himself
to
his
heart
content
darting
from
side
to
side
of
the
road
and
sniffing
for
the
smells
his
soul
delighted
in
i
did
not
concern
myself
about
his
feelings
for
paragot
suggestion
which
i
knew
was
ironically
directed
against
myself
i
did
not
care
so
long
as
i
was
to
be
with
my
companions
and
of
them
irony
did
not
matter
i
caught
the
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
laughed
he
was
as
joyous
as
narcisse
the
gladness
of
the
july
morning
danced
in
his
veins
he
pulled
the
violin
and
bow
out
of
the
old
baize
bag
and
fiddled
as
we
walked
it
must
have
been
an
amazing
procession
and
the
old
man
whose
clothes
and
functions
we
had
assumed
lay
cold
and
stiff
in
the
little
lonely
room
with
candles
at
his
head
and
his
feet
during
our
railway
journey
to
chambéry
blanquette
told
us
in
her
artless
way
what
she
knew
of
his
history
in
the
flesh
he
had
been
a
crabbed
and
crotchety
ancient
addicted
to
drink
he
had
passed
some
years
of
his
middle
life
in
prison
for
petty
thefts
in
his
youth
blanquette
mind
could
not
grasp
the
idea
of
père
paragot
having
once
been
young
he
must
have
been
an
astonishing
blackguard
he
had
been
wont
to
beat
blanquette
until
one
day
realising
her
young
strength
she
held
him
firm
in
her
grip
and
threatened
to
throw
him
into
a
pond
if
he
persisted
in
his
attempted
chastisement
since
then
he
had
respected
her
person
but
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
had
cursed
her
for
anserine
stupidity
an
unlovely
loveless
and
unloved
old
man
why
should
blanquette
have
wept
over
him
she
had
not
the
parisian
highly
strung
temperament
and
capacity
for
facile
emotion
she
was
peasant
to
the
core
slow
to
rejoice
and
slow
to
grieve
and
she
had
the
peasant
remorseless
logic
in
envisaging
the
elemental
facts
of
existence
père
paragot
was
wicked
he
was
dead
blanquette
had
not
the
divine
sense
of
humour
which
rainbows
the
tears
of
the
world
that
was
my
dear
master
possession
but
at
the
obvious
she
could
laugh
like
any
child
of
unsophistication
in
the
long
shaded
avenue
of
chambéry
with
its
crowded
on
either
side
stalls
where
you
saw
displayed
for
sale
rolls
of
calico
and
boots
and
gauffrettes
and
rusty
locks
and
melons
and
rosaries
and
flyblown
books
paragot
bought
me
my
red
shirt
which
dictu
had
tasselled
cords
to
tie
the
collar
and
pomade
for
my
hair
he
also
purchased
a
yard
of
blue
chiffon
which
he
tied
in
an
artistic
bow
round
narcisse
neck
whereat
blanquette
laughed
heartily
and
when
narcisse
bolted
beneath
a
and
growling
dispossessed
himself
of
the
adornment
and
set
to
with
tooth
and
claw
to
rend
it
into
fragments
she
threw
herself
on
a
bench
convulsed
with
mirth
as
paragot
had
spent
fifty
centimes
on
the
chiffon
i
thought
this
hilarity
exceedingly
but
when
another
and
a
larger
dog
came
up
to
see
what
narcisse
was
doing
and
in
half
a
minute
was
whirling
about
with
narcisse
in
a
death
grapple
and
blanquette
sprang
forward
separated
the
two
dogs
at
some
risk
and
took
our
bleeding
mongrel
to
her
bosom
consoling
him
with
womanly
words
of
pity
i
saw
there
was
something
tender
in
blanquette
which
mitigated
my
resentment
the
restaurant
du
soleil
where
the
marriage
feast
was
held
was
an
earwiggy
hostelry
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
sheltered
from
the
prying
roadway
by
a
screen
of
green
lattice
and
a
series
of
the
dusty
arbours
each
furnished
with
table
and
chairs
beloved
of
french
revellers
above
the
entrance
gate
stretched
the
bearing
in
addition
to
the
name
the
legend
jardin
noces
fêtes
within
a
few
closely
planted
threw
deep
shadow
over
the
grassless
garden
shrubs
and
flowers
wilted
in
a
neglected
bed
usually
the
forlorn
demesne
was
supervised
by
a
mangy
waiter
brooding
over
mangy
tables
and
by
a
mangier
cat
who
kept
a
furtive
eye
on
the
placarded
list
of
each
day
du
and
wondered
when
her
turn
would
come
for
thursday
de
but
tables
cat
and
waiter
cast
manginess
aside
when
the
pride
of
that
day
still
remains
and
makes
me
italicise
the
word
came
down
to
play
at
the
wedding
of
adolphe
querlat
and
léontine
bringuet
where
is
père
paragot
asked
fat
madame
bringuet
perspiring
in
unaccustomed
corset
and
black
bombazine
alas
he
is
no
longer
madame
explained
blanquette
he
had
a
seizure
yesterday
he
fell
off
his
chair
and
we
picked
him
up
stone
dead
but
it
is
sad
but
no
it
does
not
matter
this
gentleman
will
make
you
dance
much
better
than
père
paragot
and
she
whispered
encomiums
into
ear
enchanted
monsieur
and
your
name
my
master
swept
a
courtly
bow
with
his
feathered
hat
no
one
ever
bowed
so
magnificently
as
he
berzélius
nibbidard
paragot
at
your
service
you
must
be
hungry
monsieur
paragot
and
mademoiselle
and
this
little
monsieur
said
madame
bringuet
hospitably
we
are
at
table
in
the
à
you
will
join
us
we
entered
the
long
narrow
room
and
sat
down
to
the
banquet
heavens
what
a
feast
there
were
omelettes
and
geese
and
eels
and
duck
and
tripe
and
onion
soup
and
sausages
and
succulences
inconceivable
accustomed
to
the
spartan
fare
of
vagabondage
i
plunged
into
the
dishes
head
foremost
like
a
hungry
puppy
should
i
eat
such
a
meal
as
that
it
would
be
my
death
hey
for
the
light
heart
and
elastic
stomach
of
youth
some
fifty
persons
the
and
arrière
of
the
relations
of
the
young
couple
guzzled
in
a
wedged
and
weltering
mass
wizened
grandfathers
and
stolid
children
ate
and
panted
in
the
suffocating
heat
and
gorged
again
not
till
half
way
through
the
repast
did
tongues
begin
to
wag
freely
at
last
the
tisane
of
champagne
syrupy
paradise
to
my
uncultivated
palate
was
handed
round
and
the
toasts
were
drunk
the
bride
garter
was
secured
amid
boisterous
shouts
and
innuendos
and
then
we
left
the
stifling
room
and
entered
the
garden
the
elders
to
smoke
and
drink
and
gossip
at
the
little
tables
beneath
the
verandah
the
younger
folk
to
dance
on
the
uneven
gravel
young
as
i
was
i
felt
grateful
that
no
physical
exercise
was
required
of
me
for
some
hours
to
come
even
narcisse
and
the
cat
which
followed
him
waddled
heavily
to
the
verandah
where
we
were
to
play
the
signal
to
start
was
soon
given
paragot
tucked
his
violin
under
his
chin
tuned
up
waved
one
two
three
with
his
bow
blanquette
struck
a
cord
on
her
zither
and
the
dance
began
at
first
all
was
desperately
correct
the
men
in
their
broadcloth
and
white
ties
and
enormous
wedding
favours
the
women
in
their
tight
and
decent
finery
gyrated
with
solemn
circumspection
but
by
degrees
the
music
and
the
good
savoy
wines
and
the
abominable
cognac
flushed
faces
and
set
heads
the
sweltering
heat
caused
a
gradual
discarding
of
garments
arms
took
a
closer
grip
of
waists
loud
laughter
and
free
jests
replaced
formal
conversation
steps
were
performed
of
southern
fantasy
the
dust
rose
in
clouds
throats
were
choked
though
countenances
streamed
the
consumption
of
wine
was
rabelaisian
and
all
through
the
orgy
paragot
fiddled
with
strenuous
and
blanquette
thrummed
her
zither
with
the
awful
earnestness
of
a
woman
on
whose
efforts
ten
francs
and
perhaps
half
a
goose
depended
but
it
was
paragot
who
made
the
people
dance
to
me
sitting
in
red
shirt
and
pomaded
hair
at
his
feet
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
a
magician
he
threw
his
bow
across
the
strings
and
compelled
them
to
do
his
bidding
he
was
the
great
the
omnipotent
personage
of
the
feast
i
sunned
myself
in
his
glory
indeed
he
had
the
incommunicable
gift
of
setting
his
soul
as
he
played
of
putting
the
devil
into
the
feet
of
those
who
danced
the
wedding
party
were
enraptured
if
he
had
consumed
all
the
bumpers
he
was
offered
he
would
have
been
as
drunk
as
a
fiddler
at
an
irish
wake
during
a
much
needed
interval
in
the
dancing
he
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
verandah
and
as
a
solo
played
stephen
heller
tarantella
which
crowned
his
triumph
with
his
unkempt
beard
and
swarthy
face
and
ridiculous
velveteens
there
was
an
air
of
rakish
picturesqueness
about
paragot
and
he
retained
what
indeed
he
never
quite
lost
a
certain
aristocracy
of
demeanour
wild
cries
of
saluted
him
when
he
stopped
men
clapped
each
other
on
the
shoulder
uttering
clumsy
oaths
women
smiled
at
him
largely
madame
bringuet
reeking
in
her
tight
gown
held
up
to
him
a
brimming
glass
of
champagne
the
bride
threw
him
a
rose
he
kissed
the
flower
put
it
in
his
and
after
bowing
low
drank
to
her
health
i
recalled
my
childish
ambition
to
keep
a
fried
fish
shop
and
despised
it
heartily
if
i
only
could
play
the
violin
like
paragot
thought
i
and
win
the
plaudits
of
the
multitude
what
greater
glory
could
the
earth
hold
the
practical
blanquette
woke
me
from
my
dreams
now
was
the
moment
said
she
to
go
round
with
the
hat
i
swung
myself
down
from
the
verandah
the
traditional
shell
in
lieu
of
a
hat
in
my
hand
and
went
my
round
money
was
poured
into
it
time
after
time
i
emptied
it
into
my
bulging
pockets
when
i
returned
to
the
verandah
blanquette
eyes
distended
strangely
she
glanced
at
paragot
who
smiled
at
her
in
an
absent
manner
for
the
moment
the
artist
in
him
was
predominant
he
was
the
centre
of
his
little
world
and
its
adulation
was
as
breath
to
his
nostrils
this
is
what
i
the
mature
man
know
to
be
the
case
to
me
then
he
was
but
the
king
receiving
tribute
from
his
subjects
when
paragot
with
a
flourish
of
his
bow
responded
to
the
encore
i
found
my
hand
slip
into
blanquette
and
there
it
remained
in
a
tight
grip
till
flushed
and
triumphant
he
again
acknowledged
the
applause
nothing
was
said
between
blanquette
and
myself
but
she
became
my
sworn
sister
from
that
moment
and
narcisse
sat
at
our
feet
looking
down
on
the
crowd
his
tongue
lolling
out
mockingly
and
a
satiric
leer
on
his
face
my
children
said
paragot
on
our
return
journey
in
the
close
compartment
we
have
had
a
glorious
day
one
of
those
peaks
that
rise
here
and
there
in
the
monotonous
range
of
life
it
fills
the
soul
with
poetry
and
makes
one
talk
in
metaphor
in
such
moments
as
these
we
are
all
metaphors
my
son
we
are
illuminated
expressions
of
the
divine
standing
for
the
commonplace
things
of
yesterday
and
tomorrow
we
have
accomplished
what
millions
and
millions
are
striving
and
struggling
and
failing
to
do
at
this
very
hour
we
have
achieved
we
have
left
on
human
souls
the
impress
of
our
mastery
we
are
also
all
of
us
and
i
perceive
disinclined
to
listen
to
transcendental
conversation
i
not
tired
master
i
declared
as
stoutly
as
the
effort
of
keeping
open
two
leaden
eyelids
would
allow
and
you
he
asked
turning
to
blanquette
by
his
side
i
occupied
the
opposite
corner
she
confessed
a
very
little
but
she
had
listened
to
all
monsieur
had
said
and
if
he
continued
to
talk
she
would
not
think
of
going
to
sleep
whereupon
she
closed
her
eyes
and
when
i
opened
mine
i
saw
that
her
head
had
slipped
along
the
smooth
wooden
back
of
the
carriage
and
rested
on
paragot
shoulder
through
sheer
kindliness
and
pity
he
had
put
his
arm
around
her
so
as
to
settle
her
comfortably
as
she
slept
i
envied
her
when
she
awoke
at
the
first
stoppage
of
the
train
she
started
away
from
him
with
a
little
gasp
o
monsieur
i
did
not
know
you
should
have
told
me
i
am
only
père
paragot
said
he
you
must
often
have
had
your
head
against
this
mountebank
jacket
of
mine
she
misunderstood
him
her
eyes
flashed
it
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
swear
it
she
held
up
her
two
forefingers
crossed
and
kissed
them
père
paragot
non
neither
he
nor
another
i
am
an
honest
girl
though
you
may
not
think
so
my
good
blanquette
said
he
kindly
taking
her
scarred
coarse
hand
in
his
you
are
as
honest
a
girl
as
ever
breathed
and
if
père
paragot
did
let
you
put
your
sleepy
little
head
on
his
shoulder
he
must
have
been
a
stonier
hearted
old
curmudgeon
than
you
have
given
one
to
believe
so
he
soothed
her
and
explained
while
our
two
fellow
passengers
a
wizened
old
peasant
and
his
wife
regarded
them
stolidly
it
is
hot
said
blanquette
do
you
think
so
asticot
i
wish
i
had
a
fan
i
will
make
you
one
out
of
the
paper
the
fowl
is
wrapped
in
said
paragot
not
half
a
goose
but
a
cold
fowl
minus
half
a
wing
had
been
our
supplementary
guerdon
decently
enveloped
in
a
sheet
of
newspaper
it
lay
on
her
lap
when
he
had
divested
it
of
its
covering
which
he
proceeded
to
twist
into
a
fan
it
still
lay
on
her
lap
looking
astonishingly
naked
at
the
next
station
the
old
peasant
and
his
wife
got
out
and
we
had
the
compartment
to
ourselves
blanquette
produced
from
her
pocket
a
handkerchief
knotted
over
an
enormous
lump
these
are
the
takings
monsieur
it
looks
small
but
they
changed
the
coppers
into
silver
at
the
restaurant
for
me
it
a
fortune
laughed
my
master
it
is
much
she
replied
gravely
and
undoing
the
knot
she
offered
him
with
both
hands
the
glittering
treasure
i
hope
you
will
be
a
little
generous
monsieur
i
know
it
was
you
who
gained
the
my
good
child
cried
he
interrupting
her
and
pushing
back
her
hands
what
lunacy
are
you
uttering
do
you
imagine
that
i
go
about
fiddling
for
pence
at
village
weddings
but
monsieur
but
little
imbecile
i
did
it
to
help
you
to
enable
you
to
get
your
ten
francs
and
half
a
goose
asticot
too
have
you
been
enchanted
all
day
to
be
of
service
to
mademoiselle
do
you
want
to
be
paid
for
wearing
a
red
shirt
with
a
tasselled
collar
and
pommade
in
your
hair
are
we
going
about
the
world
like
don
quixote
and
sancho
panza
rescuing
damsels
in
distress
is
that
the
lodestar
of
our
wanderings
yes
master
said
blanquette
looked
from
him
to
me
from
me
to
him
scarce
able
to
grasp
such
magnanimity
to
the
peasant
money
is
a
commodity
to
be
struggled
for
fought
for
grasped
prized
to
be
doled
out
like
the
drops
of
a
priceless
elixir
vitæ
paragot
had
the
aristocratic
artistic
scorn
of
it
and
i
as
i
have
said
before
was
the
pale
reflexion
of
paragot
it
is
yours
i
explained
as
might
a
great
prince
chamberlain
the
master
gained
it
for
you
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
the
corners
of
her
lips
went
down
paragot
turned
half
round
in
his
seat
and
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
if
you
spill
tears
on
the
fowl
you
will
make
it
too
salt
and
i
shall
throw
it
out
of
the
window
paragot
paid
the
modest
funeral
expenses
of
the
fiddler
asked
why
he
did
not
leave
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
communal
authorities
he
replied
that
he
could
not
take
a
man
name
without
paying
for
it
such
an
appellation
as
berzélius
nibbidard
paragot
was
worth
a
deal
coffin
and
a
mass
or
two
this
fine
sense
of
integrity
was
above
blanquette
comprehension
she
thought
the
funeral
was
a
waste
of
money
it
should
go
to
benefit
the
living
and
not
the
dead
she
argued
wait
till
you
are
dead
yourself
he
replied
and
see
how
you
would
like
to
be
robbed
of
your
name
there
are
many
things
for
you
to
learn
my
child
a
pas
not
many
she
said
with
a
sigh
we
who
are
poor
and
live
on
the
learn
very
quickly
if
you
are
hungry
and
have
two
sous
you
can
buy
bread
if
you
only
have
two
sous
and
you
throw
them
to
a
dog
who
does
need
them
you
have
nothing
to
buy
bread
with
and
you
starve
and
it
is
not
so
easy
to
gain
two
sous
paragot
sucked
reflectively
at
his
porcelain
pipe
asticot
said
he
the
ad
is
irrefutable
now
i
must
go
and
make
my
she
said
i
return
to
chambéry
to
try
to
earn
my
two
sous
wo
you
stay
here
over
the
night
you
must
be
very
tired
one
must
work
for
one
living
monsieur
she
said
moving
away
it
was
afternoon
we
had
trudged
the
three
dusty
miles
back
from
the
tiny
churchyard
where
we
had
left
the
old
man
unlamented
grave
and
paragot
as
usual
was
washing
his
throat
with
beer
it
must
be
noted
not
to
his
glorification
that
about
this
time
a
chronic
dryness
began
to
be
the
main
characteristic
of
paragot
throat
and
the
only
humectant
that
seemed
to
be
of
no
avail
was
water
the
sun
still
blazed
and
the
hush
of
the
july
afternoon
lay
over
the
valley
paragot
watched
the
thickset
form
of
blanquette
disappear
into
the
café
he
poured
out
another
bottle
of
beer
and
addressed
narcisse
who
was
blinking
idly
up
at
him
if
she
had
a
pair
of
decent
stays
my
dog
or
no
stays
at
all
she
might
have
something
of
a
figure
what
do
you
think
on
the
whole
no
narcisse
stood
on
his
hind
legs
his
forepaws
on
his
master
arm
and
uttered
little
plaintive
whines
paragot
patted
him
on
the
head
as
i
was
engaged
a
yard
or
two
away
elbows
on
knees
in
what
paragot
was
pleased
to
call
my
studies
thierry
récits
des
temps
mérovingiens
a
tattered
flyblown
copy
of
which
he
had
bought
at
chambéry
he
was
careful
not
to
interrupt
me
he
talked
to
the
dog
paragot
had
to
talk
to
something
if
he
were
alone
he
would
have
talked
to
his
shadow
in
his
coffin
he
would
have
apostrophised
the
worms
yes
my
dog
said
he
after
a
draught
of
beer
we
have
passed
through
more
than
we
wotted
of
these
two
days
we
have
held
a
human
being
by
the
hand
and
have
faced
with
her
the
eternal
verities
now
she
is
going
to
earn
her
two
sous
in
the
whirlpool
and
the
whirlpool
will
suck
her
down
and
as
she
has
not
claims
to
beauty
narcisse
of
any
kind
whatsoever
either
of
face
or
figure
hers
will
be
a
shuddersome
career
and
end
say
you
are
sorry
for
poor
blanquette
de
veau
narcisse
sniffed
at
the
table
but
finding
it
bare
of
everything
but
beer
in
which
he
took
no
interest
dropped
on
his
four
legs
and
curled
himself
up
in
dudgeon
you
damned
cynical
sensualist
cried
my
master
i
have
wasted
the
breath
of
my
sentiment
upon
you
and
he
called
out
for
the
landlady
and
more
beer
presently
blanquette
emerged
laden
with
zither
case
and
fiddle
and
little
grey
valise
and
the
suit
which
was
slung
over
one
arm
monsieur
she
said
putting
down
her
impedimenta
the
has
told
me
that
you
have
paid
for
my
lodging
and
my
nourishment
i
am
very
grateful
monsieur
and
if
you
will
accept
this
costume
it
will
be
a
way
of
repaying
your
kindness
paragot
rose
took
the
suit
and
laid
it
on
his
chair
i
accept
it
loyally
said
he
with
a
bow
as
if
blanquette
had
been
a
duchess
monsieur
et
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
paragot
stuck
both
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
my
good
child
said
he
you
are
bound
straight
for
the
most
cheerless
hell
that
was
ever
inhabited
by
unamusing
devils
blanquette
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
spoke
in
her
dull
fatalistic
way
i
know
it
is
not
gay
but
it
is
in
the
when
père
paragot
was
alive
it
was
different
he
had
his
good
qualities
père
paragot
he
was
like
a
if
any
man
came
near
me
he
was
fierce
i
did
not
amuse
myself
it
is
true
but
i
remained
an
honest
girl
now
it
is
changed
i
am
alone
i
go
into
a
brasserie
to
play
and
dance
i
can
get
an
engagement
at
the
café
brasserie
tissot
and
then
after
a
pause
turning
her
head
away
she
added
the
fatalistic
words
she
had
used
before
faut
passer
par
là
comme
les
i
forbid
you
cried
my
master
striding
up
and
down
in
front
of
her
and
ejaculating
horrible
oaths
he
invoked
the
sacred
name
of
pigs
and
of
all
kinds
of
other
things
my
attention
had
long
since
been
diverted
from
the
learned
monsieur
thierry
and
i
wondered
what
she
had
to
pass
through
like
the
others
it
must
be
something
dreadful
or
my
master
would
not
be
raving
so
profanely
i
learned
in
after
years
of
all
mutilated
lives
there
are
few
more
ghastly
than
those
of
the
de
in
a
small
french
provincial
town
and
here
was
blanquette
about
to
abandon
herself
to
it
with
stolid
hopeless
resignation
there
was
no
question
of
vicious
instinct
what
semblance
of
glamour
the
life
presented
did
not
attract
her
in
the
least
a
sweated
alien
faces
in
the
east
end
with
more
pleasurable
anticipation
i
am
not
going
to
allow
you
to
take
an
engagement
in
a
brasserie
shouted
my
master
do
you
hear
i
forbid
you
but
monsieur
began
blanquette
piteously
then
paragot
had
one
of
his
sudden
inspirations
he
crashed
his
fist
on
the
little
table
so
that
the
glass
and
bottles
leaped
and
narcisse
darted
for
shelter
into
the
café
de
he
cried
i
have
it
it
is
an
illumination
asticot
here
leave
your
book
i
shall
be
paragot
in
character
as
well
as
name
we
shall
fiddle
with
blanquette
as
we
fiddled
yesterday
and
i
shall
be
a
like
père
paragot
and
keep
her
an
honest
girl
we
make
it
a
firm
paragot
and
company
and
there
will
always
be
two
sous
for
bread
and
two
to
throw
to
a
dog
i
like
throwing
sous
to
dogs
it
is
my
nature
now
i
know
why
i
was
sent
into
the
world
it
was
to
play
the
fiddle
up
and
down
the
sunny
land
of
france
my
little
asticot
why
have
we
thought
of
it
before
you
shall
learn
to
play
the
trumpet
asticot
and
narcisse
shall
walk
on
his
hind
legs
and
collect
the
money
it
will
be
magnificent
are
you
serious
monsieur
asked
blanquette
trembling
serious
over
an
inspiration
that
came
straight
from
the
but
yes
i
am
serious
toi
he
added
sharply
using
for
the
first
time
the
familiar
pronoun
are
you
afraid
i
will
beat
you
like
père
paragot
you
can
if
you
like
she
said
huskily
and
i
wondered
why
on
earth
she
should
have
turned
the
colour
of
cream
cheese
chapter
vii
not
being
content
with
having
attached
to
his
person
a
stray
dog
and
a
mongrel
boy
and
rendering
himself
responsible
for
their
destinies
paragot
must
now
saddle
himself
with
a
young
woman
had
she
been
a
beautiful
gipsy
holding
fascinating
allurements
in
lustrous
eyes
and
pomegranate
lips
and
witchery
in
a
supple
figure
the
act
would
have
been
a
commonplace
of
human
weakness
but
in
the
case
of
poor
blanquette
squat
and
coarse
her
heavy
features
only
redeemed
from
ugliness
by
youth
honesty
and
clean
teeth
the
eternal
attraction
of
sex
was
absent
from
the
decorative
point
of
view
she
was
as
unlovely
as
narcisse
or
myself
she
was
dull
unimaginative
ignorant
as
far
removed
from
paragot
as
narcisse
from
a
greyhound
why
then
in
the
name
of
men
and
angels
should
paragot
have
taken
her
under
his
protection
my
only
answer
to
the
question
is
that
he
was
paragot
judge
other
men
by
whatever
standard
you
have
to
hand
it
will
serve
its
purpose
in
a
rough
and
ready
manner
but
paragot
unless
with
me
idolatry
has
obscured
reason
paragot
can
only
be
measured
by
that
absolute
standard
which
lies
awful
and
unerring
on
the
knees
of
the
high
gods
of
course
he
saved
the
girl
from
a
hideous
doom
thousands
of
kindly
earnest
men
have
done
the
same
in
one
way
or
another
but
paragot
way
was
different
from
anyone
else
its
glorious
lunacy
lifted
it
above
ordinary
human
methods
so
many
of
your
wildly
impulsive
people
repent
them
of
their
generosities
as
soon
as
the
magnanimous
fervour
has
cooled
the
grandeur
of
paragot
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
never
repented
he
was
fantastic
wastrel
braggart
what
you
will
but
he
had
an
exaggerated
notion
of
the
value
of
every
human
soul
save
his
own
the
destiny
of
poor
blanquette
was
to
him
of
infinitely
more
importance
than
that
of
the
wayward
genius
that
was
paragot
the
pathos
of
his
point
of
view
had
struck
me
even
as
a
child
when
he
discoursed
on
my
prospects
i
am
paragot
my
son
he
would
say
a
film
full
of
wind
and
wonder
fantasy
and
folly
driven
like
thistledown
about
the
world
i
do
not
count
but
you
my
little
asticot
have
the
great
responsibility
before
you
it
is
for
you
to
uplift
a
corner
of
the
veil
of
life
and
show
joy
to
men
and
women
where
they
would
not
have
sought
it
work
now
and
gather
wisdom
my
son
so
that
when
the
great
day
comes
you
may
not
miss
your
destiny
and
once
he
added
wistfully
as
i
have
missed
mine
as
paragot
decided
that
we
should
not
start
off
then
and
there
into
the
unknown
but
remain
at
the
café
until
we
had
laid
our
plan
of
campaign
blanquette
took
her
valise
into
the
house
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
busied
herself
in
the
kitchen
with
the
paragot
drank
with
the
villagers
in
the
café
and
i
when
thierry
and
narcisse
had
given
me
all
the
companionship
they
had
to
offer
curled
myself
up
on
the
mattress
spread
in
a
corner
of
the
tiny
à
and
went
to
sleep
the
next
morning
paragot
awakened
with
an
idea
he
would
go
to
which
was
close
by
and
would
return
in
the
evening
the
nature
of
his
errand
he
would
not
tell
me
who
was
i
little
grey
worm
that
i
was
to
question
his
outgoings
and
his
incomings
the
little
grey
worm
would
stay
with
blanquette
and
narcisse
and
see
to
it
that
they
did
not
bite
each
other
i
humbly
accepted
the
rebuke
and
obeyed
the
behest
the
afternoon
found
the
three
of
us
in
a
field
under
a
tree
blanquette
embracing
her
knees
and
the
dog
asleep
with
his
throat
across
her
feet
she
was
wearing
her
old
cotton
dress
and
as
she
had
been
helping
the
all
the
morning
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up
to
her
elbows
displaying
stout
stubby
arms
the
top
button
of
her
bodice
was
open
she
was
but
her
hair
little
deeper
in
shade
than
her
tanned
face
and
neck
was
coiled
neatly
had
it
not
been
for
the
hard
grip
of
the
day
before
i
should
have
jealously
resented
her
admission
into
our
vagabond
fraternity
as
it
was
from
the
height
of
my
masculinity
i
somewhat
looked
down
upon
her
not
as
poor
blanquette
the
vagrant
but
as
a
girl
could
we
creation
lords
do
with
a
creature
of
an
inferior
sex
in
our
wanderings
could
she
perform
our
feats
of
endurance
i
questioned
her
anxiously
she
laughed
i
am
as
strong
as
any
man
you
will
see
she
leaped
to
her
feet
and
before
i
could
protest
had
picked
me
off
the
ground
like
a
kitten
and
was
tossing
me
in
her
arms
she
said
depositing
me
tenderly
on
the
grass
and
having
collected
the
dislodged
narcisse
she
embraced
her
knees
and
laughed
again
it
was
a
kind
honest
laugh
a
big
boy
laugh
coming
full
out
of
her
eyes
and
shewing
her
strong
white
teeth
i
lost
the
sense
of
insult
in
admiration
of
her
strength
you
should
have
been
a
boy
blanquette
said
i
she
assented
acknowledging
at
once
her
inferiority
and
thus
restoring
my
self
respect
you
are
lucky
you
to
be
one
in
this
world
the
egg
is
for
the
men
and
the
shell
is
for
the
women
why
do
you
cut
off
your
hair
and
put
on
boy
clothes
i
asked
then
you
would
get
the
egg
no
one
could
tell
the
difference
you
do
think
i
look
like
a
woman
i
dieu
where
are
your
eyes
she
was
actually
indignant
with
me
who
had
thought
to
please
her
my
first
encounter
with
the
bewildering
paradox
of
woman
mais
she
panted
i
may
be
strong
like
a
man
but
à
i
do
resemble
one
look
and
she
sat
bolt
upright
her
hands
at
her
waist
developing
her
bust
to
its
full
extent
she
was
not
she
explained
but
she
was
as
solidly
built
as
another
i
was
to
examine
myself
and
see
how
like
i
was
to
the
flattest
of
boards
routed
i
chewed
blades
of
grass
in
silence
until
she
spoke
again
tell
me
of
the
the
i
asked
puzzled
yes
monsieur
your
master
you
must
call
him
said
i
not
for
the
was
any
peddling
boss
the
leader
of
a
troupe
of
performing
dogs
or
the
miserable
landlord
of
a
village
inn
paragot
a
i
meant
no
harm
i
have
too
much
respect
for
him
said
blanquette
humbly
again
reinstated
in
my
position
of
superiority
i
explained
the
master
to
her
feminine
intelligence
he
has
been
to
every
place
in
the
world
and
knows
everything
that
is
to
be
known
and
speaks
every
language
that
is
spoken
under
the
sun
and
has
read
every
book
that
ever
was
written
and
i
have
seen
him
break
a
violin
over
a
man
head
said
blanquette
in
the
forum
at
rome
last
winter
he
had
an
argument
with
the
most
learned
professor
in
europe
who
is
making
the
excavations
and
proved
him
to
be
wrong
repeated
blanquette
much
impressed
though
of
forum
or
excavations
she
had
no
more
notion
than
narcisse
if
he
wanted
to
be
a
king
tomorrow
he
would
only
have
to
go
up
to
a
throne
and
sit
upon
it
but
no
said
blanquette
to
be
a
king
one
must
be
a
king
son
how
do
you
know
that
he
is
i
asked
with
a
expression
of
mystery
king
sons
do
go
about
the
high
roads
with
little
like
you
replied
the
practical
blanquette
how
do
you
know
that
i
am
not
a
king
son
too
i
asked
less
with
the
idea
of
than
that
of
vindication
of
paragot
because
you
yourself
said
that
your
mother
sold
you
as
my
mother
sold
me
to
père
paragot
whereupon
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
as
far
as
retentiveness
of
memory
was
concerned
blanquette
was
not
such
a
fool
as
in
my
arrogance
i
had
set
her
down
to
be
i
was
going
to
retort
that
his
magnificence
in
purchasing
me
proved
him
a
personage
of
high
order
but
as
i
quickly
reflected
that
the
same
argument
might
apply
to
the
rank
of
the
contemned
père
paragot
i
refrained
a
silence
ensuing
i
uncomfortably
resolved
to
study
my
master
with
a
view
to
acquiring
his
skill
in
repartee
but
what
does
he
do
the
master
enquired
blanquette
do
what
do
you
mean
how
does
he
earn
his
living
that
shows
you
know
nothing
about
him
i
cried
triumphantly
sons
do
not
earn
their
living
they
have
got
it
already
have
you
ever
read
that
in
books
i
can
read
and
write
but
i
do
read
books
sighed
blanquette
i
am
not
clever
you
will
have
to
teach
me
this
is
the
book
i
am
reading
said
i
taking
the
récits
des
temps
mérovingiens
from
my
pocket
again
blanquette
sighed
you
must
be
very
clever
asticot
not
at
all
said
i
modestly
but
i
felt
that
it
was
nice
of
blanquette
to
realise
the
intellectual
gulf
between
us
it
is
the
master
who
has
taught
me
all
i
know
i
spoke
god
wot
as
if
my
knowledge
would
have
burst
through
the
covers
of
an
encyclopædia
three
years
ago
i
could
not
speak
a
word
of
french
fancy
and
now
you
still
talk
like
an
englishman
said
blanquette
looking
back
now
on
those
absurd
days
i
wonder
whether
after
all
i
did
not
learn
as
much
that
was
vital
from
blanquette
as
from
paragot
her
downright
direct
unimaginative
amounted
to
genius
at
the
time
i
preferred
genius
in
the
fantastic
form
which
inflated
my
bubbles
of
instead
of
bursting
them
but
in
after
life
one
has
a
high
appreciation
of
the
burster
in
the
moment
mortification
however
i
recriminated
you
make
worse
mistakes
than
i
do
you
say
when
you
ought
to
say
vais
and
i
heard
you
talk
about
that
is
because
i
have
no
education
replied
blanquette
with
her
grave
humility
i
speak
like
the
peasants
not
like
instructed
people
not
like
the
master
for
instance
no
one
could
speak
like
the
master
said
i
there
was
a
long
silence
blanquette
hugged
her
knees
and
narcisse
snored
at
her
feet
accepting
her
as
vagabond
comrade
i
lay
on
my
back
and
forgot
blanquette
and
out
of
the
intricacies
of
myriad
leaf
and
branch
against
the
sky
wove
pictures
of
merovingian
women
there
where
the
black
branches
cut
a
lozenge
of
blue
was
the
pale
queen
galeswinthe
lying
on
her
bed
through
yon
dark
cluster
of
one
could
discern
the
strangler
sent
by
king
hilperic
to
murder
her
and
in
that
radiant
patch
silhouetted
clear
and
cold
and
fierce
in
loveliness
was
frédégonde
waiting
for
the
king
she
was
a
glittering
sword
of
a
woman
whose
slayings
fascinated
me
i
much
preferred
her
to
the
gentler
brunehilde
whose
form
i
saw
outlined
in
a
soft
shadow
of
green
i
tried
to
find
frames
in
my
aerial
gallery
for
brunehilde
two
daughters
ingonde
and
chlodoswinde
especially
the
latter
whose
name
appealed
to
my
acquired
taste
for
odd
nomenclature
and
the
conscious
effort
brought
me
back
to
the
modern
world
and
the
sound
of
blanquette
voice
asticot
i
can
wash
the
master
shirts
and
mend
his
clothes
i
can
also
make
his
coffee
in
the
morning
her
eyes
had
a
look
she
was
living
in
the
land
of
day
dreams
even
as
i
had
been
i
always
prepare
the
master
breakfast
said
i
jealously
it
is
the
woman
duty
i
do
care
i
retorted
she
unclasped
her
hands
and
coming
forward
on
to
her
knees
and
bending
over
me
brushed
a
strand
of
hair
from
my
forehead
i
will
prepare
yours
too
asticot
she
said
gently
and
you
will
see
how
nice
that
will
be
men
ca
do
these
things
where
there
is
a
woman
to
look
after
them
it
is
not
proper
so
flattered
in
my
masculinity
being
ranked
with
paragot
as
a
man
i
took
a
sultanesque
view
of
the
situation
and
graciously
consented
to
her
proposed
ministrations
paragot
came
back
triumphant
from
had
he
told
me
he
had
been
inspired
to
go
there
the
man
who
played
the
violin
at
the
restaurant
by
the
lac
de
bourget
had
just
that
day
fallen
ill
the
result
a
week
engagement
for
blanquette
and
himself
but
my
child
said
he
you
will
have
to
suffer
an
inharmonious
son
of
satan
who
makes
a
discordant
hades
out
of
an
execrable
piano
he
had
the
impudence
to
tell
me
that
he
came
from
the
conservatoire
he
with
as
much
ear
for
music
as
an
monkey
he
said
to
me
paragot
that
i
played
the
violin
not
too
badly
i
foresee
a
hideous
doom
overhanging
that
young
man
my
children
before
the
week
is
out
i
will
throw
him
into
the
maw
of
his
piano
ha
my
children
give
me
to
drink
for
i
am
thirsty
mindful
of
my
dignity
as
a
man
i
glanced
at
blanquette
who
went
into
the
café
obediently
while
i
stayed
with
my
master
it
was
a
sweet
moment
paragot
gripped
me
by
the
shoulder
my
son
while
blanquette
and
i
work
which
carlyle
says
is
the
noblest
function
of
man
but
concerning
which
i
have
my
own
ideas
you
can
not
live
in
pomaded
and
otherwise
picturesque
and
studious
laziness
look
he
cried
pointing
to
a
round
flat
object
wrapped
in
paper
which
he
had
brought
with
him
do
you
know
what
that
is
that
said
i
is
a
cake
it
is
a
tambourine
said
my
master
the
next
day
found
us
in
the
garden
of
the
little
restaurant
at
playing
at
lunch
time
the
young
man
at
the
piano
whom
i
had
expected
to
see
a
fiend
in
human
shape
was
a
harmless
consumptive
fellow
who
played
with
the
sweet
patience
of
a
musical
box
he
shook
hands
with
me
and
called
me
and
before
nightfall
told
me
of
a
disastrous
in
consequence
of
which
were
it
not
for
his
mother
he
would
drown
himself
in
the
lake
he
effaced
himself
before
paragot
much
as
the
does
before
the
organist
his
politeness
to
blanquette
would
have
put
to
the
blush
any
young
man
at
the
bon
marché
or
the
louvre
his
name
was
laripet
i
was
ordered
to
make
modest
use
of
my
tambourine
until
sufficient
instruction
from
paragot
should
authorise
him
to
let
me
loose
with
it
i
was
merely
to
add
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
group
on
the
platform
and
at
intervals
to
go
the
round
of
the
guests
collecting
money
i
liked
this
for
i
could
then
jingle
the
tambourine
without
fear
of
reproof
you
have
no
idea
what
an
ordeal
it
is
for
a
boy
to
have
a
tambourine
which
he
must
not
jingle
but
the
shady
charm
of
the
garden
compensated
for
the
repression
of
noisy
instincts
after
months
of
tramping
in
the
broiling
sun
free
and
perfect
as
it
was
the
easy
loafing
life
seemed
sweet
we
went
little
into
the
gay
town
itself
for
my
part
i
did
not
like
it
consisted
of
a
vast
enchanted
garden
set
in
a
valley
great
mountains
hemming
it
round
skirting
the
enchanted
garden
were
shady
streets
and
mysterious
palaces
some
having
gardens
of
their
own
of
a
secondary
enchantment
and
shops
where
jewels
and
perfumes
and
white
ties
and
flowers
and
other
objects
of
strange
luxury
were
exhibited
in
the
windows
but
these
took
the
humble
place
of
mere
accessories
to
the
enchanted
garden
jealously
guarded
against
asticot
by
great
high
gilded
railings
and
by
functionaries
at
the
gates
within
rose
two
wonder
houses
gorgeous
with
dome
and
pinnacle
bewildering
with
gold
and
snow
displaying
before
the
aching
sight
the
long
cool
stretch
of
verandahs
and
offering
the
baffling
glimpse
of
vast
interiors
whence
floated
the
dim
sound
of
music
and
laughter
and
bright
happy
beings
in
wondrous
raiment
wandered
in
and
out
unchallenged
unconcerned
as
if
the
wonder
houses
were
their
birthright
i
a
shabby
penniless
little
peri
stood
at
the
gilded
gates
disconsolate
i
did
like
it
the
mystery
of
the
unknown
beatitude
within
the
wonder
houses
oppressed
me
to
faintness
was
through
the
leaves
of
a
tree
i
could
see
the
pale
queen
galeswinthe
but
through
those
gay
enchanting
walls
i
could
see
nothing
they
baulked
my
soul
when
i
tried
to
explain
my
feelings
to
paragot
he
looked
at
me
in
his
kind
sad
way
and
shook
his
head
my
little
asticot
said
he
within
those
gewgaw
wonder
houses
then
he
stopped
abruptly
and
waved
me
away
no
it
a
devilish
good
thing
for
you
to
have
something
your
imagination
boggles
at
stick
to
the
ideal
my
son
and
hug
the
unexplained
the
people
who
have
solved
the
riddle
of
the
universe
at
fifteen
are
bowled
over
by
the
enigma
of
their
cook
at
fifty
plug
your
life
as
full
as
it
can
hold
with
fantasy
and
and
thank
god
that
your
soul
is
baulked
by
the
mysteries
of
the
casinos
of
but
what
do
they
do
there
master
i
persisted
the
men
worship
strange
goddesses
and
the
women
run
after
false
gods
and
all
practice
fascinating
idolatries
i
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
he
meant
which
was
what
he
intended
when
i
consulted
blanquette
one
morning
as
she
and
i
alone
were
sauntering
down
the
long
shady
avenue
which
connects
the
town
with
the
of
the
lake
she
said
that
people
went
into
the
cercle
and
the
villa
des
fleurs
the
two
wonder
houses
aforesaid
merely
to
gamble
i
the
notion
the
master
says
they
are
temples
of
great
strange
gods
where
people
worship
gods
what
an
idea
a
que
le
bon
quoth
blanquette
you
have
evidently
not
heard
of
the
gods
of
greece
and
rome
jupiter
and
apollo
and
venus
and
bacchus
said
blanquette
i
have
heard
italians
swear
di
bacco
that
is
why
of
course
said
i
in
my
grandest
manner
and
there
are
heaps
of
other
gods
besides
all
the
same
she
objected
i
always
thought
the
italians
were
good
catholics
so
they
may
be
said
i
but
that
does
prove
that
there
are
not
beautiful
gods
and
goddesses
and
idols
and
shrines
in
the
cercle
and
the
villa
des
fleurs
as
this
was
unanswerable
blanquette
diverted
the
conversation
to
the
less
transcendental
topic
of
the
premature
baldness
of
monsieur
laripet
if
the
doings
of
the
bright
happy
beings
were
hidden
from
me
while
they
worshipped
in
the
casinos
i
at
least
met
them
at
close
quarters
in
the
garden
of
the
restaurant
du
lac
in
some
respects
this
garden
resembled
that
of
the
restaurant
du
soleil
at
chambéry
there
was
a
verandah
round
the
restaurant
itself
there
were
trees
in
joyous
leafage
there
were
little
tables
and
there
were
waiters
hurrying
to
and
fro
with
napkins
under
their
arms
but
that
was
all
the
resemblance
our
little
platform
stood
against
the
railings
separating
the
garden
from
the
quay
behind
us
shimmered
the
blue
lake
great
mountains
rising
behind
away
on
the
right
embosomed
in
the
green
mountainside
flashed
the
white
château
de
hautecombe
always
in
a
tiny
churned
up
a
wake
of
white
foam
on
the
quay
itself
stood
an
enchanting
little
box
a
to
which
i
as
a
fellow
artist
was
given
the
by
the
proprietor
and
in
which
one
could
see
heavenly
pictures
of
the
surrounding
landscape
there
were
also
idle
cabs
with
white
awnings
and
fezzed
turks
perspiring
under
furs
and
rugs
which
they
hawked
for
sale
in
front
of
us
within
the
garden
a
joyous
crowd
of
the
radiantly
raimented
laughed
over
dainty
food
set
on
snowy
cloths
here
and
there
a
lobster
struck
a
note
of
colour
or
a
ray
of
sunlight
striking
through
the
red
or
gold
translucencies
of
wine
in
a
glass
which
distracted
my
attention
from
my
orchestral
duties
and
caused
an
jingle
of
my
tambourine
what
i
loved
most
was
to
make
my
round
among
the
tables
and
mingle
closely
with
the
worshippers
of
the
men
clean
and
correct
in
their
perfectly
fitting
flannels
sometimes
stern
sometimes
mocking
sometimes
pettishly
cross
i
was
rather
shy
but
i
was
quite
at
my
ease
with
the
women
even
with
those
whose
many
rings
and
jewels
violent
perfumes
and
daring
effects
of
dress
made
me
instinctively
differentiate
from
their
quieter
and
less
bejewelled
sisters
blanquette
laughingly
called
me
a
and
said
that
i
made
soft
eyes
at
them
perhaps
i
did
when
one
is
a
hundred
and
fifty
it
is
hard
to
realise
that
one
little
scarecrow
boy
eyes
may
have
touched
the
hearts
of
women
but
the
appeal
of
the
outstretched
tambourine
was
rarely
refused
get
out
of
this
the
man
would
say
but
no
remain
a
si
what
is
your
name
asticot
madame
à
votre
this
always
amused
the
lady
she
would
search
through
an
invariably
empty
purse
give
him
fifty
centimes
and
the
man
would
throw
a
silver
piece
into
the
tambourine
once
i
was
in
luck
the
lady
found
a
piece
in
her
purse
that
is
all
i
have
i
have
no
change
growled
the
man
if
i
give
you
this
said
the
lady
what
would
you
do
with
it
if
madame
would
tell
me
where
to
get
it
i
would
buy
a
photograph
of
madame
said
i
with
one
of
paragot
inspirations
for
she
was
very
pretty
she
laughed
putting
the
gold
into
my
hand
me
fais
la
cour
come
and
see
me
at
the
villa
marcelle
and
i
will
give
you
a
photograph
gratis
but
paragot
when
i
repeated
the
conversation
to
him
called
the
lady
shocking
names
and
forbade
me
to
go
within
a
mile
of
the
villa
marcelle
so
i
did
not
get
the
photograph
the
next
best
thing
i
loved
was
to
see
blanquette
eyes
glitter
when
i
returned
to
the
platform
and
poured
silver
and
copper
into
her
lap
she
uttered
strange
little
exclamations
under
her
breath
and
her
fingers
played
caressingly
with
the
coins
we
gain
more
here
in
a
day
than
père
paragot
did
in
a
week
it
is
wonderful
pas
maître
she
said
one
morning
paragot
tuned
his
violin
and
looked
down
on
her
money
pleases
you
blanquette
of
course
she
counted
the
takings
sou
by
sou
yet
you
did
not
want
to
accept
your
just
share
what
you
make
me
take
is
not
just
master
she
said
simply
much
as
she
loved
money
her
sense
of
justice
rebelled
against
division
of
the
takings
a
third
for
laripet
a
third
for
blanquette
and
a
third
for
himself
which
he
generously
shared
with
me
père
paragot
used
to
sweep
into
his
pockets
every
sou
and
blanquette
had
to
subsist
on
whatever
he
chose
to
allow
for
joint
expenses
her
new
position
of
independence
was
a
subject
for
much
inward
pride
mingled
however
with
a
consciousness
of
her
own
unworthiness
monsieur
laripet
yes
she
would
grant
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
same
as
the
master
but
herself
no
was
not
the
master
the
great
artist
and
she
but
the
clumsy
strummer
was
he
not
also
a
man
with
more
requirements
than
she
tobacco
absinthe
brandy
and
the
like
a
third
is
too
much
she
added
if
you
argue
said
he
i
will
divide
it
in
halves
for
laripet
and
yourself
and
i
wo
touch
a
penny
that
would
be
idiotic
said
blanquette
it
would
be
in
keeping
with
life
generally
he
answered
in
a
comic
opera
one
thing
is
not
more
idiotic
than
another
yes
monsieur
laripet
we
will
give
them
i
once
drove
in
coffin
nails
to
that
tune
in
verona
now
we
will
set
people
eating
to
it
in
we
monsieur
laripet
you
and
i
who
ought
to
be
the
petted
minions
of
great
capitals
it
is
a
comic
opera
one
has
to
get
bread
or
one
would
starve
said
blanquette
pursuing
her
argument
and
to
get
bread
one
must
have
money
if
i
had
all
the
money
you
would
not
eat
bread
i
should
eat
laughed
paragot
quoting
marie
antoinette
you
always
laugh
at
me
master
said
blanquette
wistfully
paragot
drew
his
bow
across
the
strings
there
is
nothing
in
this
comical
universe
i
do
laugh
at
my
little
blanquette
said
he
i
am
like
good
old
montaigne
i
rather
laugh
than
weep
because
to
laugh
is
the
more
dignified
laripet
struck
a
chord
on
the
piano
paragot
joined
in
and
played
three
bars
then
he
stopped
short
there
was
not
the
vestige
of
a
laugh
on
his
face
it
was
deadly
white
and
his
eyes
were
those
of
a
man
who
sees
a
ghost
the
four
bright
happy
beings
two
ladies
and
two
men
who
had
just
entered
the
garden
and
at
whom
his
stare
was
directed
took
no
notice
but
followed
a
bowing
maître
to
a
table
that
had
been
reserved
for
them
i
sprang
to
the
platform
on
the
edge
of
which
i
had
been
squatting
at
blanquette
feet
are
you
ill
master
he
started
ill
of
course
not
pardon
monsieur
laripet
he
plunged
into
the
merry
tune
and
fiddled
with
all
his
might
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
i
saw
his
nostrils
quivering
and
the
sweat
running
down
his
face
into
his
beard
chapter
viii
when
was
over
he
sat
on
the
wooden
chair
provided
for
him
and
wiped
his
face
his
hands
shook
he
beckoned
me
to
come
near
do
i
look
too
grotesque
a
mountebank
tomfool
he
asked
in
english
he
was
wearing
the
velveteen
suit
whose
magnificence
he
had
enhanced
by
newly
purchased
shoes
and
black
stockings
and
to
a
less
bigoted
worshipper
than
me
i
suppose
he
must
have
looked
a
mountebank
tomfool
but
i
only
gaped
at
his
question
do
i
he
repeated
almost
fiercely
you
look
beautiful
master
said
i
he
passed
his
lean
fingers
wearily
over
his
eyes
pardon
my
little
asticot
there
are
things
in
heaven
and
earth
etc
myriads
of
mysteries
as
many
in
the
heart
of
man
as
in
your
wonder
houses
yonder
get
me
some
brandy
three
poured
into
a
tumbler
i
went
off
to
the
restaurant
and
obtained
the
drink
when
i
returned
they
were
playing
the
mocking
chorus
that
runs
through
orphée
aux
enfers
the
number
over
paragot
drained
the
glass
at
one
gulp
the
company
broke
into
unusual
applause
some
one
shouted
get
me
some
more
said
he
do
you
know
why
i
chose
that
tune
no
master
because
twenty
devils
entered
into
me
and
played
leapfrog
over
one
another
i
am
very
fond
of
that
little
tune
it
is
so
gay
said
blanquette
as
if
she
were
introducing
a
fresh
topic
of
conversation
i
detest
it
said
my
master
the
maître
came
up
and
asked
that
the
chorus
should
be
played
again
as
an
encore
i
fetched
paragot
drink
and
having
set
it
down
beside
him
on
the
platform
went
round
with
my
tambourine
when
i
reached
the
table
at
which
the
four
new
comers
were
seated
i
found
that
they
spoke
english
they
were
a
young
man
in
a
straw
hat
a
young
girl
a
forbidding
looking
man
of
forty
with
a
beaky
nose
and
the
loveliest
lady
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
she
had
the
complexion
of
a
her
eyes
were
the
blue
of
glaciers
and
they
shone
cold
and
steadfast
but
her
lips
were
kind
her
black
hair
under
the
large
white
tulle
hat
had
the
rare
bluish
tinge
looking
as
if
cigarette
smoke
had
been
blown
through
it
small
and
exquisitely
made
she
sat
the
princess
of
my
boyish
dreams
i
call
it
a
ripping
tune
cried
the
young
girl
i
hate
it
more
than
any
other
tune
in
the
world
said
the
lovely
lady
with
a
shiver
her
voice
was
like
a
peal
of
bells
or
running
water
or
whatever
silvery
sounding
things
you
will
it
is
very
absurd
to
have
such
prejudices
said
the
man
of
forty
he
spoke
like
a
frenchman
and
like
a
very
disagreeable
frenchman
how
dared
he
address
my
princess
in
that
tone
i
extended
my
tambourine
que
vous
désirez
asked
the
young
man
in
an
accent
as
britannic
as
the
main
deck
of
the
bellerophon
anything
that
the
ladies
will
kindly
give
me
sir
i
replied
in
our
native
tongue
hullo
english
what
are
you
knocking
about
france
for
i
glanced
at
the
lovely
lady
she
was
crumbling
bread
and
not
taking
the
least
notice
of
me
i
was
piqued
my
master
thinks
it
the
best
way
to
teach
me
philosophy
sir
said
i
politely
if
i
had
not
learned
much
philosophy
from
him
i
had
at
least
learned
politeness
the
lady
looked
up
with
a
smile
the
young
girl
exclaimed
that
either
my
remark
or
myself
i
forget
which
was
ripping
i
paid
little
heed
to
her
i
have
always
disregarded
the
people
of
one
adjective
they
seem
to
one
who
has
sunned
himself
in
the
wealth
of
paragot
epithets
your
master
is
the
gentleman
in
the
pearl
buttons
enquired
the
young
man
yes
sir
what
his
name
berzélius
nibbidard
paragot
sir
said
i
so
proudly
that
the
lovely
princess
laughed
i
must
look
at
him
she
said
turning
round
in
her
chair
i
too
glanced
at
the
familiar
group
on
the
platform
laripet
with
his
back
to
us
working
his
arms
and
shoulders
at
the
piano
blanquette
seated
on
the
other
side
thrumming
away
at
the
zither
on
her
lap
narcisse
lolling
his
tongue
in
that
cynical
grin
of
his
and
paragot
fiddling
in
front
like
a
fiddler
possessed
his
clear
eyes
fixed
on
the
lady
in
a
most
uncanny
stare
when
she
turned
again
she
shivered
once
more
she
did
not
look
up
but
went
on
crumbling
bread
it
shocked
me
to
notice
that
the
pink
of
her
face
had
gone
and
that
her
fingers
trembled
then
a
wild
conjecture
danced
through
my
brain
and
i
forgot
my
tambourine
you
still
here
laughed
the
young
man
what
are
you
waiting
for
i
started
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
i
moving
away
he
laughed
and
called
me
back
here
are
two
francs
to
buy
a
philosophy
book
and
here
are
five
sous
not
to
come
and
worry
us
again
said
the
older
man
in
french
while
i
was
wondering
why
they
tolerated
such
a
disagreeable
man
in
the
party
my
beautiful
lady
fingers
flew
to
the
gilt
chain
purse
by
her
side
and
here
are
five
francs
because
you
are
english
she
exclaimed
and
as
she
held
me
for
a
second
with
her
eyes
i
saw
in
them
infinite
depths
of
sadness
and
longing
when
i
returned
to
the
platform
the
piece
had
just
been
brought
to
an
end
paragot
poured
his
second
brandy
down
his
throat
and
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
i
shed
as
usual
my
takings
into
blanquette
lap
on
seeing
the
piece
her
eyes
equalled
it
in
size
cent
sous
who
gave
it
you
i
explained
the
most
beautiful
lady
in
the
world
paragot
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
me
haggardly
why
did
she
give
you
five
francs
because
i
was
english
she
said
did
she
talk
to
you
yes
master
and
i
have
never
heard
anyone
speak
so
beautifully
paragot
made
no
answer
but
began
to
tune
his
violin
during
the
next
interval
my
quartette
left
the
restaurant
i
ran
to
the
gate
and
bowed
as
they
passed
by
the
young
fellow
gave
me
a
friendly
nod
but
the
lovely
lady
swept
out
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
a
large
cab
with
a
gay
awning
awaited
them
on
the
quay
as
my
lady
entered
her
skirt
uplifted
ever
so
little
disclosed
the
most
delicately
shaped
tiny
foot
that
has
ever
been
attached
to
woman
and
then
i
felt
sure
those
little
feet
so
adored
the
haunting
phrase
leaped
to
my
brain
and
i
stood
staring
at
the
departing
carriage
athrill
with
excitement
it
was
joanna
lovelier
than
i
had
pictured
her
in
my
lotus
club
dreams
more
gracious
than
ingonde
or
chlodoswinde
or
any
of
the
dames
du
temps
whose
ballade
by
maître
françois
villon
my
master
had
but
lately
made
me
learn
by
heart
and
whose
names
were
so
many
sweet
symphonies
it
was
joanna
pure
and
ravishing
as
an
april
dawn
joanna
beloved
of
paragot
in
those
elusive
days
when
i
could
not
picture
him
before
he
smashed
his
furniture
with
a
crusader
mace
and
started
on
his
wanderings
under
the
guidance
of
henri
quatre
it
was
joanna
whom
he
had
an
agonized
desire
to
see
in
madrid
and
whose
silvery
english
voice
he
had
longed
to
hear
and
i
asticot
had
seen
her
and
had
heard
her
silvery
voice
among
boys
assuredly
i
was
the
most
blessed
but
paragot
seemed
that
day
of
all
men
the
most
miserable
and
i
more
than
narcisse
in
my
sympathy
with
his
moods
almost
lifted
up
my
nose
and
whined
for
woe
all
my
thrill
died
away
i
felt
guilty
oddly
ashamed
of
myself
i
took
a
pessimistic
view
of
life
what
thought
i
are
joannas
sent
into
the
world
for
save
to
play
havoc
with
men
happiness
maître
françois
villon
was
quite
right
samson
sardanapalus
david
maître
françois
himself
all
came
to
grief
over
joannas
heureux
qui
rien
happy
is
he
who
has
nothing
to
do
with
as
soon
as
we
were
free
paragot
left
us
and
went
off
by
himself
whereupon
i
mimetic
as
an
ape
rejected
the
humble
invitation
to
take
a
walk
with
her
and
strolled
moodily
into
the
town
with
narcisse
at
my
heels
a
dog
fight
or
two
and
a
byronic
talk
with
a
little
towheaded
who
gave
me
a
dusty
bunch
of
cyclamen
as
a
she
said
prettily
whiled
away
the
time
until
the
people
began
to
drift
out
of
the
wonder
houses
to
dress
for
dinner
i
lingered
at
the
gates
going
from
one
to
the
other
in
the
unavowed
hope
little
idiot
that
i
was
of
seeing
joanna
at
last
at
the
main
entrance
to
the
villa
des
fleurs
i
caught
sight
of
paragot
he
had
changed
from
the
velveteens
into
his
vagabond
clothes
and
was
evidently
on
the
same
errand
as
myself
i
did
not
venture
near
respecting
his
desire
for
solitude
but
lounged
at
the
corner
of
the
main
street
and
the
road
leading
down
to
the
villa
playing
with
narcisse
and
longing
for
something
to
happen
you
see
it
is
not
given
every
day
to
an
impressionable
youngster
his
brain
stuffed
with
poetry
pictures
and
such
like
delusive
visionary
things
to
tumble
head
first
into
the
romance
of
the
actual
world
for
the
moment
the
romance
was
at
a
standstill
i
longed
for
a
further
chapter
it
was
a
pity
i
reflected
that
we
did
not
live
in
merovingian
times
then
paragot
and
i
could
have
lain
in
wait
with
our
horses
everyone
had
horses
in
knightly
days
and
when
joanna
came
near
we
should
have
killed
the
man
and
paragot
would
have
swung
her
on
his
saddlebow
and
we
should
have
galloped
away
to
his
castle
in
the
next
kingdom
where
paragot
and
joanna
and
i
with
blanquette
to
be
tirewoman
to
our
princess
would
have
lived
happy
ever
after
what
i
expected
to
get
for
myself
heaven
knows
it
did
not
strike
me
that
perennial
contemplation
of
bliss
might
wear
out
the
stoutest
altruism
then
suddenly
out
of
the
door
of
the
villa
came
two
ladies
one
of
whom
i
recognised
as
joanna
and
the
other
as
the
young
girl
of
the
luncheon
party
the
façade
of
the
villa
stretches
across
the
road
and
is
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
corner
i
saw
paragot
stand
rigid
and
make
no
sign
of
recognition
as
she
passed
him
by
with
her
head
up
like
a
proud
queen
i
felt
an
odd
pain
at
my
heart
why
was
she
so
cruel
her
eyes
were
of
the
blue
of
glaciers
but
all
the
rest
of
her
face
had
seemed
tender
and
kind
i
was
aware
in
a
general
way
that
radiantly
attired
ladies
do
not
shake
hands
with
ragamuffins
in
public
places
but
you
must
please
to
remember
that
i
no
more
considered
paragot
a
ragamuffin
than
i
thought
blanquette
the
equal
of
joanna
paragot
to
me
was
the
peer
of
kings
i
turned
away
sorrowing
and
sauntered
up
the
little
street
that
leads
to
the
etablissement
des
bains
i
was
disappointed
in
joanna
and
did
not
want
to
see
her
again
she
should
be
punished
for
her
cruelty
i
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
on
the
place
and
looking
at
the
mairie
clock
stolidly
thought
of
supper
they
made
famous
onion
soup
at
the
little
auberge
where
we
lodged
and
paragot
himself
a
connoisseur
had
pronounced
their
à
la
mode
de
superior
to
anything
that
housekeeper
had
executed
for
the
lotus
club
besides
i
was
getting
hungry
with
youth
a
full
heart
rarely
compensates
an
empty
stomach
and
now
even
my
heart
was
growing
empty
presently
who
should
emerge
into
the
place
but
the
two
ladies
i
sat
on
my
bench
and
watched
them
cross
they
were
evidently
going
up
the
hill
to
one
of
the
hotels
behind
the
etablissement
in
her
white
dress
and
white
tulle
hat
coloured
by
three
great
roses
with
her
beautiful
hair
and
face
and
swaying
supple
figure
she
looked
the
incarnation
of
all
that
was
worshipful
in
woman
i
could
have
knelt
and
prayed
to
her
why
was
she
so
cruel
to
my
master
i
regarded
her
with
mingled
reproach
and
adoration
but
the
mixed
feeling
gave
place
to
one
of
amazement
when
i
saw
her
separate
from
her
companion
who
continued
her
way
up
the
hill
and
strike
straight
across
the
place
in
my
direction
was
coming
to
i
rose
took
off
my
ragged
hat
and
twirled
it
in
my
fingers
which
was
the
way
that
paragot
had
taught
me
to
be
polite
in
france
i
want
to
speak
to
you
she
said
quickly
you
are
the
boy
with
the
tambourine
are
you
yes
mademoiselle
paragot
had
threatened
to
shoot
me
if
i
called
any
young
lady
miss
what
is
the
name
of
the
the
gentleman
who
played
the
violin
berzélius
nibbidard
paragot
that
is
not
his
real
name
no
mademoiselle
said
i
what
is
it
i
do
know
said
i
this
is
a
new
name
he
has
only
had
it
a
week
how
long
have
you
known
him
a
long
long
time
mademoiselle
he
adopted
me
when
i
was
quite
small
you
are
not
very
big
now
she
said
with
a
smile
i
am
nearly
sixteen
said
i
proudly
to
herself
she
murmured
i
do
think
i
can
be
mistaken
in
a
different
tone
she
continued
you
spoke
some
nonsense
about
his
being
your
master
and
teaching
you
philosophy
it
was
nonsense
i
replied
stoutly
he
teaches
me
everything
he
teaches
me
history
and
shakespeare
and
françois
villon
and
painting
and
schopenhauer
and
the
tambourine
her
pretty
lips
pouted
in
a
little
gasp
of
astonishment
as
she
leaned
on
her
long
parasol
and
looked
at
me
you
are
the
oddest
little
freak
i
have
come
across
for
a
long
time
i
smiled
happily
she
could
have
called
me
anything
opprobrious
in
that
silvery
voice
of
hers
and
i
should
have
smiled
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
smile
is
the
wrong
word
the
man
smiles
the
boy
grins
i
grinned
happily
has
your
master
always
played
the
violin
in
orchestras
like
this
oh
no
mademoiselle
said
i
of
course
not
he
only
began
four
days
ago
what
was
his
employment
till
then
why
none
said
i
it
seemed
absurd
for
paragot
to
have
employment
like
a
man
behind
a
i
remembered
acquaintances
of
my
mother
who
were
out
of
employment
and
their
unspeakable
vileness
then
echo
of
paragot
for
what
else
could
i
be
i
added
we
just
walk
about
europe
for
the
sake
of
my
education
my
master
said
i
was
to
learn
life
from
the
book
of
the
universe
the
lovely
lady
sat
down
i
believe
you
are
nothing
more
nor
less
than
an
amazing
little
parrot
i
sure
you
speak
exactly
like
your
master
oh
no
mademoiselle
said
i
modestly
i
wish
i
could
there
is
no
one
who
can
talk
like
him
in
all
the
world
she
gave
me
a
long
steady
look
out
of
her
blue
eyes
i
know
now
that
i
had
struck
a
chord
of
memory
that
i
had
established
beyond
question
in
her
mind
paragot
identity
with
the
man
who
had
loved
her
in
days
past
that
old
things
sweet
and
terrifying
surged
within
her
heart
even
then
holding
their
secret
i
saw
that
she
had
recognised
paragot
you
must
think
me
a
very
inquisitive
lady
she
said
with
a
forced
smile
but
you
must
forgive
me
what
you
said
this
morning
about
your
master
teaching
you
philosophy
interested
me
greatly
one
thing
i
should
like
to
know
and
she
dug
at
the
gravel
with
the
point
of
her
parasol
and
that
i
hardly
like
to
ask
is
he
are
you
very
poor
poor
it
was
a
totally
new
idea
why
no
mademoiselle
he
has
a
great
bank
in
london
which
sends
him
whenever
he
wants
them
i
once
went
with
him
he
has
heaps
of
money
the
lady
rose
so
this
going
about
as
a
mountebank
is
only
a
masquerade
she
said
with
a
touch
of
scorn
he
did
it
to
help
blanquette
said
i
blanquette
the
girl
who
plays
the
zither
my
master
has
adopted
her
too
oh
has
he
said
the
lady
the
blue
of
her
eyes
becoming
frosty
again
i
dimly
perceived
that
in
mentioning
blanquette
i
had
been
indiscreet
in
what
respect
i
know
not
i
had
intended
my
remark
to
be
a
tribute
to
paragot
she
took
it
as
if
i
had
told
her
of
a
crime
women
even
the
loveliest
of
dream
joannas
are
a
mystifying
race
heureux
qui
rien
goodbye
she
said
goodbye
mademoiselle
she
must
have
read
mortification
in
my
face
for
she
turned
after
a
step
or
two
and
said
more
kindly
you
not
responsible
anyway
then
she
paused
as
if
hesitating
while
i
stood
hat
in
hand
as
i
had
done
during
our
conversation
i
wonder
if
i
can
trust
you
she
took
her
purse
from
the
bag
hanging
at
her
waist
and
drew
out
a
gold
piece
i
will
give
you
this
if
you
promise
not
to
tell
your
master
that
you
have
spoken
to
me
this
afternoon
i
shrank
back
remember
i
had
been
for
three
years
in
the
hourly
companionship
of
a
man
of
lofty
soul
for
all
his
waywardness
and
he
had
modelled
me
like
wax
to
his
liking
the
gold
piece
was
tempting
i
had
never
owned
a
gold
piece
in
my
life
and
all
the
frost
had
melted
from
joanna
eyes
but
i
felt
i
should
be
dishonored
in
taking
money
i
promise
without
that
i
said
she
put
the
coin
back
in
her
purse
and
held
out
her
delicately
gloved
hand
promise
with
this
then
she
said
and
then
i
knew
for
the
first
time
what
an
exquisite
sensitive
thing
is
a
sweet
lady
only
such
a
one
could
have
performed
that
act
of
grace
she
converted
me
into
a
besotted
little
imbecile
weltering
in
bliss
i
would
have
pledged
my
soul
welfare
to
execute
any
phantasmagoric
behest
she
had
chosen
to
ordain
i
am
leaving
aix
tomorrow
morning
but
if
you
are
ever
in
any
trouble
by
the
way
what
is
your
name
asticot
pradel
said
i
reflecting
for
the
first
time
that
though
polydore
pradel
had
perished
and
berzélius
nibbidard
paragot
reigned
in
his
stead
my
own
borrowed
or
invented
name
remained
unaltered
augustus
smith
lingered
in
my
memory
as
a
vague
mythical
creature
of
no
account
joanna
smiled
you
are
a
little
masquerader
too
well
if
you
are
ever
in
any
trouble
and
i
can
help
you
remember
the
comtesse
de
verneuil
avenue
de
messine
paris
this
offer
of
friendship
took
my
breath
away
i
grinned
stupidly
at
her
i
was
also
puzzled
what
is
the
matter
she
laughed
the
comtesse
de
verneuil
but
you
are
english
i
stammered
yes
but
my
husband
is
french
he
is
the
comte
de
verneuil
remember
avenue
de
messine
she
nodded
graciously
and
turned
away
leaving
a
stupefied
asticot
twirling
his
hat
her
husband
and
i
had
been
calling
her
mademoiselle
all
the
time
and
i
had
been
weaving
fairy
tales
of
our
riding
off
with
her
to
paragot
castle
she
was
married
her
husband
was
the
comte
de
verneuil
worse
than
that
her
husband
was
the
disagreeable
man
who
gave
me
five
sous
to
go
away
a
sense
of
desolation
disaster
disillusionment
overwhelmed
me
i
sat
on
the
bench
and
burst
out
crying
and
narcisse
jumped
up
and
licked
my
face
chapter
ix
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
paragot
returned
to
our
inn
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
he
reeled
up
to
the
doorstep
where
i
sat
in
the
moonlight
awaiting
his
return
why
are
you
in
bed
it
was
too
hot
and
i
could
sleep
master
said
i
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
been
dismally
failing
to
compose
a
poem
on
joanna
after
the
style
of
maître
françois
villon
just
as
youthful
dramatists
begin
with
a
five
act
tragedy
so
do
youthful
poets
begin
with
a
double
ballade
in
order
to
eke
out
the
slender
stock
of
rhymes
to
joanna
i
had
to
drag
in
indianna
which
somehow
did
fit
i
remember
also
that
she
showered
her
favours
like
manna
which
was
not
very
original
paragot
seated
himself
heavily
by
my
side
the
moon
has
a
baleful
influence
my
son
said
he
in
a
thick
voice
and
you
come
under
it
if
you
sit
too
long
beneath
its
effulgence
that
what
has
happened
to
me
it
makes
one
talk
unmentionable
imbecility
he
just
missed
the
last
two
words
and
looked
at
me
with
an
air
of
solemn
triumph
it
is
the
man
in
the
moon
fault
my
little
asticot
he
continued
i
been
having
a
very
interesting
conversation
with
him
he
is
a
most
polite
fellow
he
said
if
i
would
go
up
and
join
him
he
would
make
room
for
me
it
all
a
lie
you
know
about
his
having
been
sent
there
for
gathering
sticks
on
a
sunday
he
went
of
his
own
accord
because
it
was
the
only
place
where
he
could
be
four
thousand
miles
away
from
any
woman
think
of
it
little
asticot
of
my
heart
there
are
lots
of
lies
told
about
the
moon
he
says
he
looks
down
on
the
earth
and
sees
all
of
us
little
worms
wriggling
in
and
out
and
over
one
another
and
thinking
ourselves
so
important
and
he
cracks
his
sides
with
laughing
and
your
idiots
with
spyglasses
take
the
cracks
for
mountain
ranges
and
volcanoes
i
going
to
live
in
the
moon
away
from
female
feminine
women
and
if
you
are
good
my
son
you
shall
come
too
i
explained
to
him
as
delicately
as
i
could
that
i
should
regard
such
a
change
rather
as
a
punishment
than
as
a
reward
he
broke
into
a
laugh
you
too
with
the
milk
of
the
still
wet
on
your
lips
the
trail
of
the
petticoat
over
us
all
what
has
been
putting
the
sex
feminine
into
your
little
have
you
fallen
in
love
with
blanquette
no
master
said
i
when
i
fall
in
love
it
will
be
with
a
very
beautiful
lady
paragot
pointed
upwards
i
see
another
crack
in
my
friend
sides
we
all
fall
in
love
with
beautiful
ladies
my
poor
asticot
one
after
the
other
plunging
into
destruction
with
the
comic
of
the
muttons
of
panurge
another
woolly
one
over
ho
ho
laughs
the
man
in
the
moon
and
crack
go
his
sides
the
door
opened
behind
us
and
the
proprietor
of
the
auberge
appeared
on
the
threshold
give
me
half
a
litre
of
red
wine
monsieur
bonnivard
cried
paragot
i
am
the
descendant
of
maître
jehan
cotard
whose
throat
was
so
dry
that
in
this
world
he
was
never
known
to
spit
bien
monsieur
said
the
paragot
filled
his
porcelain
pipe
and
lit
it
with
clumsy
fingers
and
did
not
speak
till
his
wine
was
brought
my
son
we
are
leaving
aix
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
started
up
in
alarm
we
had
not
finished
our
engagement
at
the
restaurant
du
lac
i
care
no
more
for
the
restaurant
du
lac
than
for
the
rest
of
the
idiot
universe
he
declared
but
blanquette
it
would
break
her
heart
all
women
hearts
can
be
mended
for
twopence
and
men
they
have
to
go
about
with
them
broken
my
son
and
the
pieces
clank
and
jangle
and
chink
and
jingle
inside
like
a
crate
of
broken
crockery
we
leave
aix
tomorrow
but
master
i
cried
there
is
no
necessity
what
do
you
mean
she
is
leaving
aix
herself
tomorrow
she
he
shouted
quite
sober
for
the
moment
who
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
i
upbraided
myself
for
a
vain
idiot
here
was
i
on
the
point
of
breaking
my
oath
sworn
on
joanna
hand
i
felt
ashamed
and
frightened
he
grasped
my
shoulder
roughly
who
do
you
mean
by
tell
me
the
lady
of
the
lake
master
said
i
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
keenly
then
relaxed
his
grip
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
the
ghost
of
a
laugh
if
you
see
holes
in
ladders
in
this
perspicacious
fashion
you
have
to
forsake
the
paths
of
art
for
the
higher
walks
of
the
prefecture
of
police
he
puffed
silently
at
his
pipe
for
a
few
moments
and
then
turning
his
head
away
asked
me
in
a
low
voice
how
can
you
know
that
she
is
leaving
tomorrow
i
lied
for
the
first
time
to
paragot
i
overheard
her
say
so
while
i
was
waiting
with
the
tambourine
sure
quite
sure
this
seemed
to
satisfy
him
to
my
great
relief
how
my
poor
little
oath
would
have
fared
under
cross
examination
i
do
know
at
any
rate
honour
was
saved
paragot
laid
aside
his
pipe
and
looked
wistfully
into
the
past
over
his
wine
bowl
the
lady
of
the
lake
he
murmured
i
have
called
her
many
things
good
and
bad
in
my
time
but
never
that
you
are
a
genius
my
little
asticot
he
finished
his
wine
slowly
holding
the
bowl
in
both
hands
the
moon
smiled
at
us
in
a
friendly
way
sailing
high
over
the
mountains
there
entered
my
head
the
novel
reflection
that
he
was
smiling
on
all
men
alike
the
good
and
the
bad
the
just
and
the
unjust
he
was
smiling
just
the
same
on
joanna
husband
her
husband
something
caught
at
my
heart
did
paragot
know
i
debated
anxiously
in
my
mind
whether
i
should
impart
the
disastrous
information
if
he
knew
that
she
was
a
married
woman
he
would
put
foolish
thoughts
out
of
his
head
for
it
was
only
in
merovingian
and
such
like
romantic
epochs
that
men
loved
other
men
wives
i
touched
him
timidly
on
the
arm
master
i
overheard
something
else
did
you
she
is
married
and
that
is
her
husband
did
he
take
off
his
hat
no
master
he
is
a
vulture
said
paragot
dreamily
he
only
gave
me
five
sous
said
i
relieved
and
yet
disappointed
at
finding
that
my
disclosure
produced
no
agitation
paragot
fumbled
in
his
pocket
we
will
not
batten
on
his
charity
said
he
and
he
cast
three
or
four
coppers
into
the
silent
street
they
crashed
rolled
and
fell
over
with
little
chinks
narcisse
who
had
hitherto
been
asleep
trotted
out
and
sniffed
at
them
paragot
laughed
then
checked
himself
and
holding
up
a
forefinger
looked
at
me
with
an
air
of
awful
solemnity
listen
to
the
wisdom
of
paragot
there
is
not
a
woman
worth
a
clean
man
that
does
not
marry
a
vulture
he
murmured
an
incoherence
or
two
and
there
was
then
a
long
silence
presently
his
head
knocked
sharply
against
the
lintel
i
roused
him
master
it
wo
be
good
for
us
to
sit
any
longer
in
the
moonshine
he
turned
a
glazed
look
on
me
minerva
owl
said
he
i
am
quite
aware
of
it
he
rose
and
lumbered
into
the
inn
and
i
having
guided
him
up
the
narrow
staircase
to
his
room
descended
to
my
bunk
in
a
corner
of
the
tiny
salon
my
sleeping
arrangements
were
always
sketchy
in
the
morning
when
i
questioned
him
as
to
our
departure
from
aix
he
affected
not
to
understand
and
told
me
that
i
had
been
dreaming
and
that
the
moonshine
had
affected
my
brain
consider
my
son
said
he
that
when
i
returned
last
night
i
found
you
fast
asleep
on
the
doorstep
and
you
never
woke
up
till
this
morning
from
this
i
gathered
that
for
the
second
time
he
had
dosed
the
book
of
his
life
to
my
prying
though
innocent
eyes
i
also
learned
the
peculiar
difference
between
philip
drunk
and
philip
sober
when
our
engagement
at
aix
was
at
an
end
the
proprietor
of
the
restaurant
desired
to
renew
it
but
paragot
declined
the
sick
violinist
whom
we
had
replaced
had
recovered
and
paragot
had
seen
him
on
the
quay
looking
through
the
railings
with
the
hungry
eyes
of
a
sort
of
musical
enoch
arden
blanquette
had
some
little
difficulty
in
preventing
him
from
rushing
out
there
and
then
and
delivering
his
fiddle
into
the
other
hands
it
was
necessary
to
be
reasonable
she
said
de
dieu
he
cried
if
i
were
reasonable
i
should
be
lost
reason
would
set
me
down
in
paris
with
gloves
and
an
umbrella
reason
would
implant
a
sunny
smile
on
my
face
above
the
red
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honour
it
would
marry
me
to
the
daughter
of
one
of
my
at
the
académie
des
beaux
arts
it
would
make
me
procreate
my
species
nom
de
it
would
make
me
send
you
and
asticot
and
narcisse
to
the
devil
if
i
were
reasonable
i
should
not
be
paragot
the
man
who
lives
according
to
reason
has
the
heart
of
a
but
out
of
regard
for
blanquette
he
served
his
time
faithfully
at
the
restaurant
du
lac
and
reconciled
his
conscience
with
reason
by
giving
the
hungry
violinist
his
own
share
of
the
takings
it
was
only
when
blanquette
suggested
the
further
exploitation
of
aix
that
he
showed
his
gascon
obduracy
if
there
was
one
place
in
the
world
where
the
soul
sickened
and
festered
it
was
mammon
was
king
thereof
and
astarte
queen
he
was
going
to
fiddle
no
more
for
sons
of
belial
and
daughters
of
aholah
he
had
set
out
to
travel
to
the
heart
of
truth
and
the
way
thither
did
not
lead
through
the
inner
shrine
of
dagon
and
astaroth
blanquette
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
he
was
talking
about
and
i
only
had
a
vague
glimmer
of
his
meaning
but
i
see
now
that
his
sensitive
nature
chafed
at
the
false
position
among
the
simple
village
folk
he
was
a
personality
compelling
awe
and
admiration
among
the
idlers
of
aix
whom
in
his
loftiness
he
despised
he
was
but
the
fiddling
mountebank
to
whom
any
greasy
wallower
in
riches
could
cast
a
disdainful
franc
so
once
more
we
took
to
the
high
road
and
paragot
threw
off
the
depressing
burden
of
mammon
joanna
and
became
his
irresponsible
self
again
i
have
but
confused
memories
of
our
fantastic
journeyings
stretches
of
long
white
road
and
blazing
sun
laughing
valleys
and
corn
fields
and
white
farmsteads
among
the
trees
now
and
then
a
village
fête
or
wedding
at
which
we
played
to
the
enthusiasm
of
the
sober
vested
peasantry
nights
passed
in
barns
deserted
byres
on
the
floor
of
cottages
and
infinitesimal
cafés
hours
of
idleness
by
the
wayside
after
the
midday
meal
when
the
four
of
us
sat
round
the
fare
provided
by
blanquette
black
bread
cheese
charcuterie
and
the
eternal
bottle
of
thin
wine
it
was
rough
but
there
was
plenty
paragot
saw
to
that
in
spite
of
blanquette
economical
endeavours
sometimes
he
would
sleep
while
she
and
i
chatted
in
low
voices
so
as
not
to
wake
him
she
told
me
of
her
wanderings
with
the
old
man
the
hardness
of
her
former
life
often
she
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
for
hunger
shivering
in
wet
rags
the
long
night
through
now
it
was
all
changed
she
ate
too
much
and
was
getting
as
fat
as
a
pig
did
i
not
think
so
in
her
artless
way
she
guided
my
finger
into
her
waistband
and
then
swelled
herself
out
like
the
frog
in
the
fable
to
prove
the
increase
in
her
girth
she
spoke
in
awestricken
whispers
of
the
master
himself
save
that
he
was
utterly
kind
impulsive
generous
boastful
and
according
to
her
untrained
ear
a
violinist
of
the
first
quality
she
knew
not
what
manner
of
man
he
was
she
had
enough
imagination
to
feel
vaguely
that
he
had
dropped
from
vast
spaces
into
her
narrow
world
but
he
was
a
mystery
once
the
previous
summer
as
she
was
resting
by
the
roadside
with
the
old
man
even
as
we
were
doing
then
an
amiable
person
she
told
me
with
easel
and
stool
and
came
along
and
requested
their
permission
to
make
an
oil
sketch
of
them
while
he
painted
he
conversed
telling
them
of
sicily
whither
he
was
going
and
of
paris
whence
he
came
in
a
dim
way
she
associated
him
with
paragot
the
two
had
the
same
trick
of
voice
and
manner
and
held
unusual
views
as
to
the
value
of
five
francs
but
the
amiable
painter
had
been
a
gentleman
elegantly
dressed
such
as
she
saw
in
the
large
towns
driving
in
cabs
and
consuming
drinks
in
expensive
cafés
whereas
the
master
was
attired
like
a
peasant
and
slept
in
barns
and
did
everything
that
the
elegantly
dressed
gentlemen
in
cafés
did
not
do
at
all
events
she
was
penetrated
with
the
consciousness
of
a
loftier
mind
and
spirit
and
she
contented
herself
even
as
i
did
with
being
his
devoted
slave
often
too
she
spoke
of
her
own
ambitions
if
she
were
rich
she
would
have
a
little
house
of
her
own
perhaps
for
company
she
would
like
someone
to
stay
with
her
she
would
keep
it
so
clean
and
would
mend
all
the
linen
and
do
the
cooking
and
save
to
go
to
market
would
never
leave
it
from
one
year
end
to
the
other
a
good
sleek
cat
to
curl
up
by
the
fireside
would
complete
her
felicity
but
blanquette
i
would
cry
the
sun
and
the
stars
and
the
high
road
and
the
smell
of
spring
and
the
fields
and
the
freedom
of
this
life
you
would
miss
them
le
ménage
she
would
reply
shaking
her
head
of
all
persons
i
have
ever
met
the
least
imbued
with
the
vagabond
instinct
was
the
professional
vagabond
blanquette
de
veau
sometimes
instead
of
sleeping
paragot
would
talk
to
us
from
the
curious
store
of
his
learning
always
bent
on
my
education
and
desirous
too
of
improving
the
mind
of
blanquette
sometimes
it
was
blanquette
who
slept
narcisse
huddled
up
against
her
while
paragot
and
i
read
our
tattered
books
or
sketched
or
discussed
the
theme
which
i
had
written
overnight
as
my
evening
task
it
was
an
odd
school
but
though
i
could
not
have
passed
any
examination
held
by
the
sons
of
men
i
verily
believe
i
had
a
wider
culture
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
than
most
youths
of
my
age
i
craved
it
it
is
true
and
i
drank
from
an
inexhaustible
source
but
few
men
have
the
power
of
directing
that
source
so
as
to
supply
the
soul
need
of
a
boy
of
sixteen
well
well
i
suppose
allah
paragot
is
great
and
mahomet
asticot
is
his
prophet
we
wandered
and
fiddled
and
zithered
and
tambourined
through
france
till
the
chills
and
rains
of
autumn
rendered
our
vagabondage
less
merry
the
end
of
october
found
us
fulfilling
a
week
engagement
at
a
brasserie
on
the
outskirts
of
tours
two
rooms
over
a
stable
and
a
manger
in
an
empty
stall
below
were
assigned
to
us
and
every
night
we
crept
to
our
resting
places
wearied
to
death
by
the
evening
work
i
have
always
found
performance
on
a
musical
instrument
exhausting
in
itself
the
tambourine
for
instance
calls
for
considerable
physical
energy
but
when
the
instrument
tambourine
violin
or
zither
is
practised
for
several
hours
in
a
little
stuffy
room
filled
with
three
or
four
dozen
obviously
unwashed
humans
reeking
with
bad
tobacco
and
worse
absinthe
and
pervaded
by
the
ghosts
of
inferior
meals
it
becomes
more
penitential
than
the
treadmill
a
dog
life
said
paragot
whereat
narcisse
sniffed
it
was
not
at
all
the
life
for
a
philosopher
dog
said
he
on
the
morning
of
the
last
day
of
our
engagement
blanquette
entered
paragot
bedchamber
as
usual
with
the
bowls
of
coffee
and
hunks
of
coarse
bread
that
formed
our
early
meal
i
had
risen
from
my
manger
and
crept
into
paragot
room
for
warmth
and
while
he
slept
i
sat
on
the
floor
by
the
window
reading
a
book
as
for
blanquette
she
had
dressed
and
eaten
long
before
and
had
helped
the
servant
of
the
café
to
sweep
and
wash
the
tables
and
make
the
coffee
for
the
household
it
was
not
in
her
peasant
nature
to
be
abed
which
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
must
be
a
characteristic
of
the
artistic
temperament
paragot
loved
it
he
only
woke
when
blanquette
brought
him
his
coffee
ordinarily
he
would
remonstrate
with
picturesque
oaths
at
being
aroused
from
his
slumbers
and
having
taken
the
coffee
from
her
hands
would
dismiss
her
with
a
laugh
he
observed
the
most
rigid
propriety
in
his
relations
with
blanquette
but
this
morning
he
directed
her
to
remain
sit
down
my
child
i
have
to
speak
to
you
as
there
was
no
chair
or
stool
in
the
uncomfortable
room
it
had
walls
and
bare
dirty
boards
and
contained
only
the
bed
and
a
table
she
sat
obediently
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
next
to
narcisse
and
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
paragot
broke
his
bread
into
his
coffee
and
fed
himself
with
the
sops
by
means
of
a
battered
when
he
had
swallowed
two
or
three
mouthfuls
he
addressed
her
my
good
blanquette
i
have
been
wandering
through
the
world
for
many
years
in
search
of
the
springs
of
life
i
do
not
find
them
by
scraping
catgut
in
the
café
brasserie
dubois
it
would
be
better
to
go
to
orléans
said
blanquette
we
were
at
the
café
de
la
couronne
there
last
winter
and
i
danced
not
even
your
dancing
at
orléans
would
help
me
in
my
quest
said
he
i
do
understand
murmured
blanquette
looking
at
him
helplessly
have
the
kindness
said
he
pointing
to
the
table
to
smash
that
confounded
violin
into
a
thousand
pieces
dieu
what
is
the
matter
cried
blanquette
it
does
not
please
me
i
know
it
is
not
a
good
one
said
blanquette
we
will
save
money
until
we
can
buy
a
better
i
would
execrate
it
were
it
a
stradivarius
said
he
his
mouth
full
of
sop
asticot
he
called
do
you
loathe
your
tambourine
yes
master
i
replied
from
the
floor
do
you
love
playing
the
zither
but
no
maître
said
blanquette
why
then
said
my
master
should
we
pursue
a
career
which
is
equally
abominable
to
the
three
of
us
we
are
not
slaves
we
must
work
said
blanquette
or
what
would
become
of
us
paragot
finished
his
coffee
and
bread
and
handed
the
bowl
to
blanquette
who
nursed
it
in
her
lap
while
he
settled
himself
snugly
beneath
the
bedclothes
the
autumn
rain
beat
against
the
dirty
little
window
and
the
wind
howled
through
chinks
and
crevices
filling
the
room
with
cold
damp
air
i
drew
the
old
blanket
which
i
had
brought
from
my
closer
round
my
shoulders
blanquette
with
her
peasant
indifference
to
change
of
temperature
sat
unconcerned
in
her
thin
cotton
dress
but
what
will
become
of
us
she
repeated
i
shall
continue
to
exist
said
he
but
i
what
shall
i
do
you
can
fill
my
porcelain
pipe
and
let
me
think
replied
paragot
she
rose
in
her
calm
obedient
way
and
having
carried
out
his
orders
reseated
herself
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
you
are
the
most
patient
creature
alive
said
he
otherwise
you
would
not
be
contented
to
go
on
playing
the
zither
which
is
not
a
very
exhilarating
instrument
my
little
blanquette
i
am
not
patient
and
i
am
not
going
to
play
the
violin
again
for
a
million
years
after
tonight
and
the
violin
is
superior
to
the
zither
blanquette
regarded
him
uncomprehending
if
i
were
a
king
i
would
live
in
a
palace
and
you
should
be
my
housekeeper
but
as
i
am
a
ragged
vagabond
too
idle
to
work
i
am
puzzled
as
to
the
disposal
of
you
she
grew
very
white
and
rose
to
her
feet
i
understand
you
are
driving
me
away
if
it
is
your
desire
i
will
earn
my
living
alone
ne
vous
serai
pas
sur
le
for
all
her
vulgar
asseveration
that
she
would
not
be
on
his
back
her
manner
held
a
dignity
which
touched
him
he
held
out
his
hand
but
i
do
drive
you
away
little
idiot
he
laughed
on
the
contrary
you
are
like
asticot
and
narcisse
you
belong
to
me
but
asticot
is
going
to
learn
how
to
become
an
artist
and
narcisse
when
he
is
bored
can
hunt
for
fleas
you
are
a
young
woman
things
must
arrange
themselves
differently
but
how
tout
it
is
very
simple
said
blanquette
how
simple
i
can
work
for
you
and
asticot
the
devil
cried
paragot
but
yes
she
went
on
earnestly
i
know
that
men
are
men
and
sometimes
they
do
not
like
to
work
it
happens
very
often
mon
i
am
alone
all
that
is
most
alone
you
are
the
only
friends
i
have
in
the
world
you
and
asticot
you
have
been
kinder
to
me
than
any
one
i
have
ever
met
i
put
you
in
my
prayers
every
night
it
is
a
very
little
thing
that
i
should
work
for
you
if
it
fatigues
you
to
scrape
the
fiddle
in
these
holes
of
cabarets
it
is
true
true
as
the
i
would
tear
myself
into
four
pieces
for
you
suis
brave
and
i
can
work
but
no
she
cried
looking
deep
into
his
eyes
you
ca
refuse
it
is
not
possible
yes
i
refuse
said
paragot
he
had
turned
on
his
side
face
on
palm
elbow
on
pillow
had
regarded
her
sternly
as
she
spoke
i
saw
that
he
was
very
angry
for
what
do
you
take
me
little
imbecile
do
you
know
that
you
insult
me
i
to
be
supported
by
a
woman
de
dieu
de
dieu
his
ire
blazed
up
suddenly
he
cursed
scolded
boasted
all
in
a
breath
blanquette
looked
at
him
terrified
she
could
not
understand
great
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
but
i
have
made
you
angry
she
wailed
the
scornful
spurning
of
her
devotion
hurt
her
less
than
the
sense
of
having
caused
his
wrath
the
primitive
savage
feminine
is
not
complicated
by
of
feeling
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
she
broke
into
repentant
protestation
she
had
not
meant
to
anger
him
she
had
spoken
from
her
heart
she
was
so
ignorant
she
would
tear
herself
into
four
pieces
for
him
she
was
she
was
alone
and
he
was
her
only
friend
he
must
forgive
her
i
feeling
monstrously
tearful
jumped
to
my
feet
yes
master
forgive
her
he
burst
out
laughing
oh
what
three
beautiful
fools
we
are
blanquette
to
think
of
supporting
two
hulking
men
i
to
be
angry
and
asticot
to
plead
tragically
as
if
i
were
a
tyrant
about
to
cut
off
her
head
my
little
blanquette
you
have
touched
my
heart
and
who
touches
the
heart
of
paragot
can
eat
paragot
legs
and
liver
if
he
is
hungry
and
drink
his
blood
if
he
is
thirsty
i
will
remember
it
all
my
life
and
if
you
will
bring
me
my
déjeuner
i
will
stay
in
bed
till
this
afternoon
then
i
am
not
to
leave
you
she
asked
somewhat
bewildered
good
heavens
no
he
cried
because
i
am
sick
of
fiddling
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
send
you
adrift
we
shall
settle
down
for
the
winter
some
capital
which
one
would
you
like
asticot
said
i
at
random
very
well
said
paragot
the
day
after
tomorrow
we
start
for
now
let
me
go
to
sleep
we
took
exactly
two
months
getting
to
the
only
incident
of
our
journey
which
i
clearly
remember
is
a
week
sojourn
at
the
farm
of
la
haye
near
chartres
where
we
had
carted
manure
and
where
we
renewed
our
acquaintance
with
monsieur
and
madame
dubosc
chapter
x
in
three
things
happened
first
paragot
slipped
in
the
street
and
broke
his
ankle
bone
so
that
he
lay
seven
weeks
in
hospital
during
which
time
blanquette
and
i
and
narcisse
lived
like
sparrows
on
the
housetops
dazed
by
the
incomprehensibilities
of
the
strange
city
secondly
paragot
aunt
his
mother
sister
died
intestate
leaving
a
small
sum
of
money
which
he
inherited
as
her
nearest
surviving
relative
thirdly
paragot
fell
into
the
arms
of
theodor
izelin
the
painter
an
old
friend
of
paris
student
days
the
consequences
of
the
first
accident
though
not
immediate
were
lasting
paragot
walked
for
ever
afterwards
with
a
slight
limp
and
his
tramps
along
the
of
europe
had
to
be
abandoned
the
consequence
of
the
second
was
that
paragot
went
to
london
some
legal
formality
the
establishment
of
identity
or
what
not
necessitated
his
presence
i
daresay
he
could
have
arranged
matters
through
consuls
and
lawyers
and
folk
but
paragot
who
was
childishly
simple
in
business
matters
obeyed
the
summons
to
london
without
question
as
a
consequence
of
the
third
i
became
an
inmate
of
the
house
of
theodor
izelin
it
was
all
very
bewildering
it
was
arranged
that
during
paragot
absence
in
england
i
should
board
with
izelin
blanquette
with
izelin
elderly
model
a
lady
of
unimpeachable
respectability
and
a
rough
and
ready
acquaintance
with
the
french
language
and
that
narcisse
should
alternate
between
the
two
establishments
paragot
business
concluded
he
would
return
to
collect
us
and
go
whither
the
wind
might
drift
him
i
was
provided
with
a
respectable
outfit
and
with
detailed
instructions
as
to
correct
behaviour
in
a
lady
house
theodor
izelin
wife
was
a
charming
woman
everything
was
arranged
but
who
could
reckon
on
paragot
on
the
night
before
his
departure
indeed
it
must
have
been
two
or
three
in
the
morning
paragot
burst
into
my
little
attic
bedroom
candle
in
hand
and
before
i
had
time
to
rub
my
startled
eyes
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
began
to
speak
my
son
said
he
i
have
had
an
inspiration
who
but
paragot
would
have
awakened
a
boy
at
two
or
three
in
the
morning
to
announce
an
inspiration
and
who
but
paragot
would
alter
the
course
of
human
lives
on
the
flash
of
an
impulse
it
came
he
cried
while
i
was
supping
with
izelin
i
told
him
i
worked
it
all
out
he
agreed
so
it
is
settled
what
master
i
asked
sitting
up
his
slouch
felt
hat
and
his
swarthy
bearded
face
his
glittering
eyes
and
the
candle
on
his
knees
gave
him
the
air
of
an
excited
guy
fawkes
your
career
my
son
the
money
i
am
going
to
collect
in
london
shall
be
devoted
to
your
education
you
shall
learn
to
paint
infant
raphael
and
izelin
shall
teach
you
and
you
shall
learn
the
manners
of
a
gentleman
and
madame
izelin
shall
teach
you
and
you
shall
learn
what
it
is
to
have
a
heart
and
if
you
care
a
hang
for
paragot
two
years
separation
shall
teach
you
two
years
i
cried
aghast
but
master
i
ca
live
two
years
here
without
you
we
find
we
can
live
without
a
devil
of
a
lot
of
things
when
we
have
to
my
son
when
i
smashed
my
furniture
with
the
crusader
mace
i
thought
i
could
not
live
anywhere
without
something
but
here
i
am
as
alive
as
a
he
went
on
talking
it
was
for
my
good
his
broken
ankle
bone
had
compelled
him
to
resign
his
peripatetic
tutorship
in
the
university
of
the
universe
in
a
narrower
academy
he
would
be
but
a
poor
instructor
if
he
had
taught
me
to
speak
the
truth
and
despise
lies
and
shams
and
to
love
pictures
and
music
and
cathedrals
and
books
and
trees
and
all
beautiful
things
de
dieu
he
had
accomplished
his
mission
it
was
time
for
other
influences
when
an
inspiration
such
as
tonight
came
to
him
he
took
it
as
a
command
from
a
higher
power
i
am
convinced
that
he
believed
it
against
which
he
was
powerless
providence
ordains
that
you
stay
here
with
the
izelins
afterwards
you
shall
go
to
janot
studio
in
paris
in
the
meantime
you
can
attend
classes
in
the
humanities
at
i
ca
understand
the
beastly
language
i
grumbled
you
will
learn
it
my
son
no
one
ever
speaks
it
out
of
hungary
i
contended
my
son
said
he
the
value
of
a
man
is
often
measured
by
his
useless
and
fantastic
attainments
then
the
candle
end
sputtered
out
and
we
were
in
darkness
paragot
bade
me
good
night
and
left
me
to
a
mingled
sense
of
burned
candle
grease
and
desolation
he
departed
the
next
day
blanquette
and
i
with
a
dejected
narcisse
at
our
heels
walked
back
from
the
railway
station
to
the
hotel
where
losing
all
sense
of
manly
dignity
i
broke
down
crying
and
blanquette
put
her
arm
round
my
neck
and
comforted
me
motherwise
two
months
afterwards
paragot
wrote
to
blanquette
to
join
him
in
paris
and
when
the
flutter
of
her
wet
handkerchief
from
the
railway
carriage
window
became
no
longer
visible
then
indeed
i
felt
myself
to
be
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
two
years
i
can
remember
even
now
their
endless
heartache
the
izelins
were
kind
madame
izelin
a
refined
hungarian
lady
became
my
staunch
friend
as
well
as
my
instructress
in
manners
my
life
teemed
with
interests
and
i
worked
like
a
little
maniac
but
all
the
time
i
longed
for
paragot
had
it
not
been
for
his
letters
i
should
have
scented
my
way
back
to
him
like
a
dog
across
europe
ah
those
letters
of
paragot
i
have
them
still
what
a
treasury
they
are
of
grotesque
fantasy
and
philosophic
wisdom
they
gave
me
but
little
news
of
his
doings
he
had
settled
down
in
paris
with
blanquette
as
his
housekeeper
his
floridly
anathematised
ankle
kept
him
hobbling
about
the
streets
while
his
heart
was
chasing
butterflies
over
the
fields
he
had
founded
a
coenaculum
for
the
cultivation
of
the
higher
conversation
at
the
café
delphine
he
had
taken
up
persian
and
was
saturating
himself
with
hafiz
and
firdusi
his
health
was
good
indeed
he
was
a
man
of
iron
constitution
blanquette
now
and
then
supplemented
these
meagre
details
of
objective
life
the
master
had
taken
a
there
were
curtains
to
his
bed
food
was
dear
in
paris
they
had
been
to
fontainebleau
narcisse
had
stolen
the
sausages
of
the
concierge
the
master
was
always
talking
of
me
and
of
the
great
future
for
which
i
was
destined
but
when
i
became
famous
i
was
not
to
forget
my
little
blanquette
i
see
the
sprawling
words
now
ne
fot
jamés
oublié
ta
petite
as
if
i
could
ever
forget
her
i
arrived
in
paris
one
evening
a
day
or
two
earlier
than
i
was
expected
it
had
been
ordained
by
paragot
that
i
should
break
my
journey
at
berlin
in
order
to
visit
that
capital
but
affection
tugged
at
my
and
compelled
me
to
travel
straight
through
from
it
was
paragot
and
blanquette
and
narcisse
that
i
wanted
to
see
and
not
berlin
yet
when
i
stepped
out
of
the
train
on
to
the
paris
platform
i
was
conscious
for
the
first
time
of
development
i
was
decently
attired
i
had
a
bag
filled
with
the
garments
of
respectability
i
had
money
in
my
pocket
also
a
packet
of
cigarettes
a
porter
took
my
luggage
and
enquired
in
the
third
person
whether
monsieur
desired
a
cab
the
temptation
was
too
great
for
eighteen
i
took
the
cab
in
a
lordly
way
and
drove
to
no
rue
des
saladiers
where
paragot
had
his
bel
appartement
and
with
the
anticipatory
throb
of
joy
at
beholding
my
beloved
master
was
mingled
a
thrill
of
happiness
asticot
in
a
cab
it
was
absurd
and
yet
it
seemed
to
fall
within
the
divine
fitness
of
things
the
cab
stopped
in
a
narrow
street
i
had
an
impression
of
tall
houses
looking
fantastically
dilapidated
in
the
dim
of
little
shops
on
the
ground
floor
and
of
little
murky
gateways
leading
to
the
habitations
above
beside
the
gateway
of
no
was
a
small
drinking
shop
sometimes
called
in
paris
a
on
account
of
the
polished
zinc
bar
which
is
its
principal
feature
untidy
slouching
people
filled
the
street
directed
by
the
concierge
to
the
à
i
mounted
narrow
evil
smelling
badly
lighted
stairs
and
rang
at
the
designated
door
it
opened
blanquette
appeared
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
désire
moi
in
another
minute
she
had
ushered
me
in
set
down
the
lamp
and
was
hugging
me
in
her
strong
young
arms
but
my
little
asticot
i
did
not
know
you
you
have
changed
you
are
no
longer
the
same
es
tout
à
fait
monsieur
how
proud
the
master
will
be
where
is
he
alas
the
master
did
not
expect
me
and
was
at
the
café
delphine
she
would
go
straightway
and
tell
him
i
must
be
tired
and
hungry
she
would
get
me
something
to
eat
but
who
would
have
thought
i
should
have
come
back
a
how
i
had
grown
i
must
see
the
this
was
the
salon
i
looked
around
me
for
the
first
time
nothing
in
it
save
the
rickettiness
of
a
faded
rep
suite
arranged
primly
around
the
walls
and
a
few
bookshelves
stuffed
with
tattered
volumes
suggested
paragot
the
round
centre
table
covered
with
american
cloth
and
the
polished
floor
were
spotless
cheap
print
curtains
adorned
the
windows
and
a
cage
containing
a
canary
hung
between
them
three
or
four
oleographs
one
a
portrait
of
garibaldi
in
gilt
frames
formed
the
artistic
decoration
it
was
i
who
chose
the
pictures
said
blanquette
proudly
she
opened
a
door
and
disclosed
the
sleeping
chamber
of
the
master
very
bare
but
very
clean
another
door
led
into
the
kitchen
a
slip
of
a
place
but
glistening
like
the
machine
room
of
a
i
have
a
bedroom
upstairs
and
there
is
one
also
for
you
which
the
master
has
taken
come
and
i
will
show
you
we
mounted
to
the
attics
and
i
was
duly
installed
i
would
have
put
some
flowers
if
i
had
known
you
were
coming
said
blanquette
we
went
down
again
and
she
prepared
food
for
me
her
plain
face
beaming
as
she
talked
she
was
entirely
happy
no
one
so
perfect
as
the
master
had
ever
been
the
head
of
a
household
of
course
he
was
untidy
but
such
was
the
nature
of
men
if
he
did
not
make
stains
on
the
floor
with
muddy
boots
and
lumps
of
meat
thrown
to
narcisse
and
litter
the
rooms
with
clothes
and
tobacco
and
books
what
occupation
would
there
be
for
a
housekeeper
as
it
was
she
worked
from
morning
to
night
and
the
result
was
it
not
neat
and
clean
and
beautiful
ah
she
was
happy
not
to
be
playing
the
zither
in
all
her
dreams
were
realised
she
had
a
and
she
had
the
master
to
serve
now
would
she
fetch
him
from
the
café
delphine
half
an
hour
afterwards
he
strode
into
the
room
followed
by
blanquette
and
narcisse
he
spoke
in
french
and
embraced
me
french
fashion
then
he
cried
out
in
english
and
wrung
me
by
the
hand
he
was
almost
as
excited
as
narcisse
who
leaped
and
barked
frantically
it
is
good
to
have
him
back
eh
blanquette
he
does
not
know
how
sad
it
has
been
without
him
blanquette
smiled
wept
and
removed
the
remains
of
my
supper
then
she
set
on
the
table
glasses
and
a
bottle
of
they
had
bought
on
the
way
home
we
drank
the
sour
sweet
champagne
as
if
it
were
liquid
gold
and
clinked
glasses
and
with
narcisse
all
talked
and
barked
together
it
was
a
glad
paragot
had
changed
very
little
the
hair
on
his
temple
was
beginning
to
turn
grey
and
his
sallow
cheeks
were
thinner
but
he
was
the
same
hairy
unkempt
creature
of
prodigious
finger
nails
and
disreputable
garments
still
full
of
strange
oaths
and
picturesque
fancy
and
still
smoking
his
pipe
with
the
porcelain
bowl
presently
blanquette
retired
to
bed
and
paragot
and
i
talked
far
into
the
night
before
we
separated
with
a
comprehensive
wave
of
the
hand
he
indicated
the
primly
set
furniture
and
polished
floor
did
you
ever
behold
such
exquisite
discomfort
poor

chapter
xi
how
far
away
it
all
seems
paris
the
rue
des
saladiers
the
janot
where
the
illustrious
painter
called
us
his
children
and
handed
us
the
sacred
torch
of
his
art
for
us
to
transmit
could
we
but
keep
it
aflame
to
succeeding
generations
the
café
delphine
with
madame
boin
fat
pink
urbane
her
hair
a
miracle
of
perrukery
enthroned
behind
the
counter
my
dear
master
paragot
himself
how
far
away
it
is
not
good
to
live
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
the
backward
vista
down
the
years
is
too
frighteningly
long
i
found
paragot
established
as
the
dictator
of
the
café
delphine
no
one
seemed
to
question
his
position
he
ruled
there
autocratically
having
instituted
sundry
ordinances
disobedience
to
which
had
exile
as
its
penalty
the
most
generous
of
creatures
he
had
nevertheless
ordained
that
as
dictator
he
should
go
to
have
declined
to
pay
for
his
absinthe
or
would
have
closed
the
café
delphine
in
a
student
face
he
had
a
prescriptive
right
to
the
table
under
the
lee
of
madame
boin
counter
and
the
peg
behind
him
was
sacred
to
his
green
hat
to
the
students
he
was
a
mystery
no
one
knew
where
he
lived
how
he
subsisted
what
he
had
been
various
rumours
filled
the
according
to
one
he
was
a
russian
nihilist
escaped
from
siberia
another
and
one
nearer
the
mark
credited
him
with
being
a
kind
of
rip
van
winkle
revisiting
old
student
scenes
after
a
twenty
years
slumber
he
seemed
to
pass
his
life
between
the
luxembourg
gardens
the
pont
neuf
and
the
café
delphine
paris
he
used
to
say
it
is
the
mich
although
he
would
turn
to
the
absolute
stranger
who
had
been
brought
as
a
privilege
to
his
table
and
say
using
the
familiar
second
person
singular
buy
me
an
evening
paper
or
addressing
the
company
at
large
somebody
is
going
to
offer
me
an
absinthe
and
promptly
order
it
he
was
never
known
to
borrow
money
this
eccentricity
vexed
the
soul
of
the
where
the
chief
use
of
money
is
to
be
borrowed
to
me
the
idea
of
paragot
asking
needy
youngsters
for
the
loan
of
five
francs
was
exquisitely
ludicrous
i
am
only
setting
down
the
impression
of
the
regarding
him
not
only
did
he
never
borrow
but
sometimes
gave
whole
francs
in
charity
one
evening
an
unseemly
quarrel
having
arisen
between
two
from
auvergne
the
boeotia
of
france
and
the
waiter
as
to
an
alleged
overcharge
of
two
sous
paragot
arose
in
wrath
and
dashing
a
louis
on
the
table
with
a
stalked
majestically
out
of
the
café
a
deputation
waited
on
him
next
day
with
the
object
of
refunding
the
twenty
francs
he
refused
naturally
to
take
a
penny
it
would
be
a
lesson
to
them
said
he
and
they
meekly
accepted
the
rebuke
but
what
did
you
study
here
before
you
went
to
sleep
an
impudent
believer
in
the
rip
van
winkle
theory
once
asked
him
the
lost
arts
of
discretion
and
good
manners
retorted
paragot
with
a
flash
of
his
blue
eyes
which
scorched
the
offender
the
students
paid
his
score
willingly
for
in
his
talk
they
had
full
value
for
their
money
i
found
the
café
delphine
a
lotus
club
with
a
difference
instead
of
being
the
scullion
i
was
a
member
and
took
my
seat
with
the
rest
and
though
none
suspected
it
paid
for
drinks
with
paragot
money
our
real
relations
were
never
divulged
it
would
affect
both
our
positions
said
he
to
explain
our
friendship
it
was
only
necessary
to
say
that
we
had
met
at
where
i
had
been
sent
to
study
with
the
famous
izelin
who
was
a
friend
of
paragot
my
son
said
he
the
fact
of
your
being
an
englishman
who
has
studied
in
and
speaks
french
like
a
frenchman
will
entitle
you
to
respect
in
the
your
previous
acquaintance
with
me
on
which
you
need
not
insist
too
much
will
bring
you
distinction
and
so
it
turned
out
i
felt
that
around
me
also
hung
a
little
air
of
mystery
which
was
by
no
means
unprofitable
or
unpleasant
to
avoid
complications
however
and
also
in
order
that
i
should
have
the
freedom
befitting
my
man
estate
and
my
true
education
in
the
paragot
threw
me
out
of
the
nest
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
and
assigning
to
me
a
fixed
allowance
bade
me
seek
my
own
shelter
and
make
my
way
in
the
world
i
made
it
as
best
i
could
and
the
months
went
on
why
i
should
have
been
dreaming
outside
the
hôtel
bristol
that
afternoon
i
can
not
remember
if
to
paragot
paris
was
the
boulevard
to
me
it
spread
itself
a
vaster
fairyland
through
which
i
loved
to
wander
and
before
whose
magnificences
i
loved
to
dream
why
not
dream
therefore
in
the
place
vendôme
surely
my
aspirations
in
those
days
soared
as
high
as
the
column
and
surely
the
student
garb
beloved
and
ordained
by
paragot
the
cap
the
tight
ankled
tight
throated
velveteens
rendered
any
eccentricity
a
commonplace
early
spring
too
was
in
the
air
which
encourages
the
young
visionary
spruce
young
men
and
tripping
with
bandboxes
under
their
arms
and
the
sun
glinting
over
their
trim
bare
heads
hurried
along
through
the
traffic
across
the
place
and
landed
on
the
pavement
by
my
side
i
must
own
to
have
been
not
unaffected
by
the
tripping
milliners
why
should
they
not
weave
themselves
too
into
a
painter
lad
spring
visions
suddenly
a
lady
of
so
radiant
a
loveliness
as
to
send
packing
from
my
head
emerged
from
the
hôtel
bristol
and
crossed
the
broad
pavement
to
a
waiting
victoria
she
had
eyes
like
the
blue
of
glaciers
and
the
tenderest
mouth
in
the
world
she
glanced
at
me
a
floppy
picturesque
paris
student
lounging
springlike
in
the
place
vendôme
is
worth
a
fair
lady
glance
of
curiosity
i
raised
my
cap
she
glanced
at
me
again
haughtily
then
again
puzzled
then
stopped
if
i
do
know
you
you
are
a
very
young
man
to
have
saluted
me
she
said
in
french
but
i
think
i
have
seen
you
before
if
i
had
not
met
you
before
i
should
not
have
bowed
you
are
the
comtesse
de
verneuil
said
i
in
english
very
boyishly
and
eagerly
the
spring
and
the
sight
of
joanna
had
sent
the
blood
into
my
pasty
cheeks
i
once
played
the
tambourine
at
aix
i
added
she
grew
suddenly
pale
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
and
clutched
at
a
bunch
of
parma
violets
she
was
wearing
they
fell
to
the
ground
no
no
it
is
nothing
she
said
as
i
stepped
forward
only
a
slight
shock
i
remember
you
perfectly
you
said
your
name
was
asticot
i
asked
you
to
come
and
see
me
why
have
you
you
said
i
might
come
if
i
were
in
want
but
thanks
to
my
dear
master
i
am
not
i
picked
up
the
violets
your
master
she
looked
relieved
and
thanked
me
with
a
smile
for
the
flowers
he
is
well
he
is
with
you
in
paris
is
he
still
playing
the
violin
he
is
well
said
i
he
is
in
paris
but
he
only
plays
the
violin
at
home
when
as
he
says
he
wants
to
have
a
conversation
with
his
soul
the
frost
melted
from
her
eyes
and
they
smiled
at
me
you
have
caught
his
trick
of
talking
you
once
called
me
an
amazing
parrot
madame
said
i
it
is
quite
true
in
the
meantime
said
she
we
ca
stand
in
the
place
vendôme
for
ever
come
for
a
drive
and
we
can
talk
in
the
carriage
in
the
i
gasped
stupefied
pointing
to
the
victoria
why
not
she
laughed
do
you
think
it
dangerous
no
said
i
but
but
she
was
already
in
the
carriage
and
as
i
stepped
in
beside
her
i
noted
the
tips
of
her
little
feet
so
adored
by
paragot
i
glad
you
english
she
remarked
arranging
the
rug
a
young
frenchman
would
have
replied
with
the
obvious
gallantry
i
think
the
young
englishman
rather
despises
that
kind
of
obviousness
the
coachman
turned
on
his
seat
and
asked
whither
he
should
drive
madame
la
comtesse
anywhere
i
do
know
then
desperately
drive
to
the
fortifications
where
the
fortifications
are
i
have
the
remotest
idea
i
believe
they
are
a
kind
of
pleasure
resort
for
people
who
want
to
get
murdered
you
hear
of
them
in
the
papers
we
cross
the
river
she
said
to
the
coachman
we
started
drove
down
the
rue
castiglione
along
the
rue
de
rivoli
struck
off
by
the
louvre
and
over
the
pont
neuf
standing
in
conversation
with
joanna
i
had
the
gutter
urchin
confidence
of
the
pavement
the
impudence
of
the
street
seated
beside
madame
la
comtesse
de
verneuil
in
an
elegant
victoria
i
was
as
dumb
as
a
fish
until
her
graciousness
set
me
more
at
my
ease
as
we
passed
through
the
i
trembled
lest
any
of
my
fellow
students
should
see
me
avec
une
femme
du
monde
chic
il
court
les
bonnes
fortunes
ce
sacré
petit
diable
ou
pêchée
i
shivered
at
their
imagined
ribaldries
and
all
the
time
i
was
athrill
with
pride
and
joy
suffused
therewith
into
imbecility
verily
i
must
be
a
to
drive
with
countesses
and
verily
it
must
be
fairyland
for
asticot
to
be
driving
in
carriage
that
is
henri
quatre
said
she
pointing
to
the
statue
as
we
crossed
the
bridge
it
was
the
first
thing
my
master
brought
me
to
see
in
paris
years
ago
i
said
with
the
very
young
curious
of
time
he
is
very
fond
of
henri
quatre
why
she
asked
i
told
her
vaguely
the
story
of
the
crusader
mace
she
listened
with
a
somewhat
startled
interest
i
believe
your
master
is
mad
she
remarked
indeed
she
added
after
a
pause
i
believe
everyone
is
mad
i
mad
you
mad
oh
i
am
not
i
cried
warmly
you
must
be
to
set
up
a
human
god
and
worship
him
as
you
do
your
master
you
are
the
maddest
of
all
of
us
mr
asticot
a
touch
of
light
scorn
in
her
tone
nettled
me
even
joanna
should
not
speak
of
him
irreverently
if
he
had
bought
you
from
your
mother
for
said
i
and
made
you
into
a
student
at
janot
you
would
worship
him
too
madame
i
have
been
wondering
whether
you
kept
your
promise
to
me
she
said
i
wish
women
were
not
so
disconcertingly
irrelevant
but
now
i
am
quite
sure
of
course
i
did
tell
my
master
i
declared
stoutly
good
and
this
little
drive
must
be
a
secret
too
if
you
wish
i
said
but
i
do
like
to
have
secrets
from
him
give
me
his
address
she
said
after
a
pause
and
i
noticed
she
spoke
with
some
effort
does
he
still
go
by
that
absurd
name
what
was
it
his
name
is
berzélius
paragot
and
he
lives
at
no
rue
des
saladiers
do
you
know
his
real
name
yes
madame
said
i
it
is
gaston
de
nérac
i
only
learned
it
lately
through
monsieur
izelin
do
you
know
izelin
too
she
asked
i
explained
my
stay
in
i
also
mentioned
monsieur
reticence
in
speaking
of
paragot
early
days
i
think
he
was
cautioned
by
my
master
and
who
do
you
think
i
am
the
sudden
question
startled
me
you
said
i
are
joanna
indeed
how
long
have
you
known
that
pray
when
i
came
to
you
with
the
tambourine
at
i
do
understand
she
said
the
frozen
blue
coming
into
her
eyes
did
he
tell
you
then
a
child
like
you
he
has
never
mentioned
your
name
to
me
madame
i
said
eagerly
for
i
saw
her
resentment
then
how
did
you
know
i
recounted
the
history
of
the
old
stocking
i
also
mentioned
appeal
to
me
as
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
a
wan
smile
played
about
her
lips
was
that
soon
after
he
bought
you
for
yes
madame
said
i
and
an
old
stocking
yes
madame
and
since
then
we
have
never
spoken
of
the
papers
but
how
did
you
know
i
was
the
the
joanna
of
the
papers
i
guessed
said
i
could
not
tell
her
of
the
pieds
si
you
are
an
odd
boy
she
said
tell
me
all
about
yourself
unversed
in
woman
wiles
i
flushed
with
pleasure
at
her
flattering
interest
i
did
not
perceive
that
it
was
an
invitation
to
tell
her
all
about
paragot
i
related
however
artlessly
the
story
of
my
life
from
the
morning
when
i
delivered
my
tattered
copy
of
paradise
lost
to
paragot
instead
of
the
greasy
washing
book
and
if
my
narrative
glowed
rosier
with
poetic
illusion
than
the
pages
on
which
it
has
been
set
down
pray
forgive
nineteen
for
seeing
things
in
a
different
light
and
perspective
from
a
hundred
and
fifty
in
my
description
of
the
lotus
club
for
instance
i
felt
instinctively
that
madame
de
verneuil
would
wince
at
the
sound
of
tripe
i
conveyed
to
her
my
own
childish
impression
of
the
magnificence
of
paragot
bedchamber
and
the
story
of
our
wanderings
became
an
idyll
of
no
man
land
and
what
is
he
doing
now
we
had
grown
so
confidential
that
we
exchanged
smiles
he
is
cultivating
philosophy
said
i
perhaps
it
was
a
sign
of
my
development
that
i
could
detect
a
little
spot
of
clay
in
my
idol
we
had
gone
south
past
the
observatoire
to
montrouge
and
had
turned
back
before
i
realised
that
we
were
in
the
boulevard
again
near
the
prearranged
end
of
my
drive
do
you
know
why
i
am
so
glad
to
have
met
you
she
asked
i
think
indeed
i
know
i
can
trust
you
i
am
in
great
trouble
and
i
have
an
idea
that
your
master
can
help
me
she
looked
at
me
so
earnestly
so
wistfully
her
face
seemed
to
grow
of
a
sudden
so
young
and
helpless
that
all
my
boy
fantastic
chivalry
was
roused
my
master
would
lay
down
his
life
for
you
madame
i
cried
and
so
would
i
even
if
i
never
never
in
this
world
forgave
him
you
would
forgive
him
in
the
next
madame
i
answered
scarce
knowing
what
i
said
and
he
would
be
contented
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
appointed
place
i
felt
as
if
i
were
about
to
descend
from
the
side
of
an
olympian
goddess
to
sordid
humanity
to
step
from
the
land
east
of
the
sun
and
west
of
the
moon
on
to
the
common
earth
it
was
i
who
looked
wistful
may
i
come
to
see
you
madame
the
quick
fear
came
into
her
eyes
not
as
yet
asticot
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
my
husband
is
queer
tempered
at
times
i
will
write
to
you
the
carriage
drove
off
for
the
second
time
she
had
left
me
with
her
husband
on
her
lips
i
had
forgotten
him
completely
i
stamped
my
foot
on
the
pavement
he
is
a
scaly
vulture
said
i
echoing
paragot
gods
how
i
hated
the
poor
man
one
evening
about
a
week
after
this
some
seven
or
eight
of
us
were
gathered
around
paragot
table
at
the
café
delphine
two
were
we
have
no
word
for
the
embryo
painter
my
companions
in
janot
of
the
rest
i
only
remember
one
poor
cazalet
he
wore
a
grotesque
attire
a
brown
stuff
tunic
girt
at
the
waist
by
a
leathern
belt
shapeless
trousers
of
the
same
material
and
sandals
he
had
long
yellow
hair
and
untrimmed
chicken
fluff
grew
casually
about
his
face
a
sombre
genius
he
used
to
paint
dark
writhing
horrors
of
souls
in
pain
and
in
his
hours
of
relaxation
to
drink
litres
of
anisette
at
first
he
disliked
and
scoffed
at
me
because
i
was
an
englishman
which
grieved
me
sorely
for
i
regarded
him
as
the
greatest
genius
save
paragot
of
my
acquaintance
i
found
him
ten
years
afterwards
a
de
on
the
belgian
frontier
it
was
about
half
past
eleven
our
table
gleamed
a
motley
wilderness
of
glasses
and
saucers
only
two
other
tables
were
occupied
at
the
one
two
men
and
a
woman
played
on
the
other
a
pair
of
players
rattled
dominoes
madame
boin
sunk
into
her
rolls
of
fat
drowsed
on
her
throne
behind
the
counter
hercule
stood
by
his
dirty
napkin
tucked
under
his
arm
listening
to
paragot
discourse
through
the
glass
side
of
the
café
one
could
see
the
moving
flaring
lights
of
the
boulevard
paragot
sipped
absinthe
and
smoked
his
eternal
pipe
with
the
porcelain
bowl
and
talked
the
do
you
call
this
aceldama
the
do
you
miserable
little
white
mice
in
clean
shirts
call
this
the
de
is
there
a
devil
of
a
fellow
among
you
save
cazalet
whose
chilblains
make
him
indecent
who
does
wear
socks
have
you
all
dress
suits
are
you
all
suffocating
with
virtue
would
any
marcel
of
you
lie
naked
in
bed
for
two
days
so
that
rodolfe
could
pawn
your
clothes
for
the
wherewithal
to
nurse
mimi
in
sickness
is
there
a
mimi
in
the
whole
etiolated
but
yes
said
my
friend
bringard
who
prided
himself
on
his
intimacy
with
life
there
are
even
a
great
many
paragot
swept
his
skinny
fingers
in
a
circular
gesture
where
are
they
here
you
see
not
it
is
a
stunted
generation
my
gentle
little
lambs
why
nom
de
he
cried
with
one
of
his
apposite
oaths
the
very
pigs
in
the
good
days
could
teach
you
lessons
in
the
romantic
vices
you
have
but
the
noble
passions
no
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
café
du
cochon
fidèle
of
course
not
what
do
you
know
it
was
situated
in
the
rue
des
cordiers
mimi
la
blonde
was
the
du
ah
there
are
no
such
du
now
exquisite
ah
he
blew
a
kiss
from
the
tips
of
his
long
nails
you
are
very
impolite
monsieur
paragot
cried
madame
boin
from
her
throne
listen
madame
said
he
to
the
story
of
the
pig
and
you
shall
judge
the
whole
quartier
was
mad
for
mimi
including
a
pig
yes
a
great
fat
clean
pig
with
sentimental
eyes
he
belonged
to
the
opposite
i
am
telling
you
the
authentic
history
of
the
every
day
the
devoted
animal
would
stand
at
the
door
and
gaze
at
mimi
with
adoration
ah
but
such
an
adoration
my
children
an
adoration
respectful
passionate
without
hope
only
now
and
then
his
poor
sensitive
snout
quivered
his
despair
sometimes
happier
rivals
with
two
legs
pour
ça
pas
moins
cochons
que
admitted
him
into
the
café
he
would
sit
before
the
counter
his
little
tail
well
arranged
behind
him
his
ears
cocked
up
politely
his
eyes
full
of
tears
he
wept
like
a
cow
this
poor
népomucène
they
called
him
népomucène
and
when
mimi
looked
at
him
he
would
utter
little
cries
of
the
heart
like
a
strangulated
troubadour
ah
it
was
hopeless
this
passion
but
for
one
long
year
he
never
wavered
the
respected
him
of
him
it
was
said
love
is
given
to
us
as
a
measure
to
gauge
our
power
of
suffering
suddenly
mimi
disappeared
she
married
a
certain
godiveau
a
charcoal
merchant
in
the
vicinity
népomucène
stood
all
day
by
the
door
with
haggard
eyes
then
knowing
she
would
return
no
more
he
walked
with
a
determined
air
to
the
roadway
of
the
boul
mich
and
cast
himself
beneath
the
wheels
of
an
omnibus
he
committed
suicide
paragot
stopped
abruptly
and
finished
his
absinthe
there
was
vociferous
applause
i
have
never
met
anyone
with
his
gift
of
magical
narration
hercule
was
summoned
amid
a
confused
hubbub
and
received
orders
for
eight
or
nine
different
kinds
of
drink
we
were
fantastic
in
our
potations
in
those
days
ah
said
paragot
excited
as
usual
by
his
success
sont
les
neiges
where
is
the
good
père
cordier
of
the
café
cordier
he
would
play
billiards
with
his
nose
and
a
little
pug
nose
at
that
my
children
when
it
grew
greasy
he
would
chalk
it
deliberately
once
he
made
a
break
of
two
hundred
and
a
champion
the
café
cordier
itself
swept
long
ago
into
the
limbo
of
dear
immemorable
dissolute
things
then
there
was
the
café
du
on
the
boul
mich
where
marie
la
démocrate
drank
bocks
in
an
evening
against
hélène
la
sévère
who
drank
where
are
such
women
now
o
generation
of
slow
worms
where
is
he
stopped
his
jaw
dropped
my
god
he
exclaimed
in
english
rising
from
his
chair
we
followed
his
gaze
astounded
i
too
sprang
up
it
was
the
comtesse
de
verneuil
standing
in
the
doorway
and
looking
in
her
frightened
way
into
the
café
joanna
in
dark
fitting
toque
and
loose
jacket
beneath
which
one
saw
a
gleaming
high
evening
dress
i
noted
swiftly
that
she
had
violets
in
her
toque
her
beauty
her
rare
daintiness
compelled
a
stupefied
silence
i
sped
towards
the
door
and
went
with
her
into
the
street
a
closed
carriage
stood
by
the
kerb
she
took
me
by
the
front
of
my
loose
jacket
and
twisted
it
nervously
get
him
out
asticot
tell
him
i
must
see
him
but
how
did
you
come
here
i
asked
i
went
first
to
the
rue
des
saladiers
the
servant
told
me
i
should
find
him
at
the
café
delphine
i
left
her
outside
and
met
him
in
the
middle
of
the
café
grasping
his
green
hat
in
one
hand
and
the
pipe
with
the
porcelain
bowl
in
the
other
all
eyes
were
turned
anxiously
towards
us
she
has
come
for
you
master
i
whispered
she
needs
you
come
what
does
she
want
with
me
it
was
all
over
and
done
with
thirteen
years
ago
his
voice
shook
she
is
waiting
said
i
drew
him
to
the
door
and
he
obeyed
me
with
strange
docility
he
drew
a
deep
breath
as
soon
as
we
emerged
on
to
the
pavement
gaston
yes
said
he
they
remained
looking
at
each
other
for
several
seconds
agitated
neither
able
to
speak
you
were
very
cruel
to
me
long
ago
she
said
at
last
my
master
remained
silent
the
wooden
stem
of
the
pipe
snapped
between
his
fingers
and
the
porcelain
bowl
fell
with
a
crash
to
the
pavement
very
cruel
gaston
but
you
can
make
a
little
reparation
now
if
you
like
i
repair
my
cruelty
to
you
he
laughed
as
men
laugh
in
great
pain
very
well
it
will
be
a
fitting
end
to
a
farce
what
can
i
do
for
madame
la
comtesse
my
husband
is
come
to
him
my
carriage
is
here
oh
put
on
your
hat
and
do
stand
there
french
fashion
bareheaded
we
are
english
we
are
what
you
will
said
my
master
putting
on
his
hat
at
present
however
i
am
mystified
by
your
lighting
on
me
in
the
dustbin
of
paris
you
must
have
done
much
sifting
i
will
tell
you
as
we
drive
she
said
i
walked
with
them
across
the
pavement
and
opened
the
carriage
door
goodnight
asticot
said
madame
la
comtesse
holding
out
her
hand
paragot
looked
from
me
to
her
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
followed
her
into
the
carriage
my
master
had
many
english
attributes
but
in
the
shrug
the
pantomime
of
kismet
he
was
exclusively
french
chapter
xii
dis
donc
said
blanquette
holding
a
half
in
each
hand
while
the
yolk
and
white
fell
into
the
bowl
who
was
the
lady
that
came
last
night
and
wanted
to
see
the
master
you
had
better
ask
him
said
i
i
have
done
so
but
he
will
not
tell
me
what
did
he
say
he
told
me
to
ask
the
serpent
i
do
know
what
he
meant
said
blanquette
i
explained
the
allusion
to
the
curiosity
of
eve
but
objected
the
literal
blanquette
there
is
no
serpent
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
unless
it
is
you
you
have
beaten
those
eggs
enough
i
remarked
you
can
teach
me
many
things
but
how
to
make
omelettes
ah
no
all
right
said
i
when
your
inordinate
curiosity
has
spoiled
the
thing
do
blame
me
she
is
very
pretty
said
blanquette
pretty
she
is
entirely
adorable
blanquette
sighed
she
must
have
a
great
many
lovers
blanquette
cried
i
scandalised
she
is
married
naturally
if
she
were
she
could
not
have
lovers
i
wish
i
were
only
half
as
beautiful
the
lump
of
butter
cast
into
the
sizzled
and
blanquette
sighed
again
i
must
explain
that
i
had
come
as
i
often
did
to
share
paragot
midday
meal
but
as
he
was
still
abed
blanquette
had
enticed
me
into
her
tiny
kitchen
the
omelette
being
for
my
sole
consumption
i
may
be
pardoned
for
my
interest
in
its
concoction
so
that
you
could
be
married
and
have
lovers
i
asked
in
a
superior
way
too
many
lovers
make
life
unhappy
she
replied
sagely
if
i
were
pretty
i
should
only
want
one
one
to
love
me
for
myself
and
for
what
are
you
loved
now
for
my
omelettes
she
said
with
a
deft
turn
of
the
blanquette
said
i
she
laughed
with
an
bête
and
ministered
to
my
wants
as
i
sat
down
to
my
meal
at
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
table
she
loved
this
great
as
was
her
pride
in
the
speckless
and
orderly
salon
she
never
felt
at
her
ease
there
in
the
kitchen
she
was
herself
at
home
and
could
do
the
honours
as
hostess
do
you
think
the
beautiful
lady
is
in
love
with
the
master
you
have
been
reading
the
of
the
and
your
head
is
full
of
sentimental
nonsense
i
cried
it
is
not
nonsense
for
a
woman
to
love
the
master
oho
i
exclaimed
teasingly
perhaps
you
are
in
love
with
him
too
she
turned
her
back
on
me
and
began
to
clean
a
spotless
casserole
ton
she
said
my
meal
over
i
went
to
paragot
room
i
found
him
in
bed
not
as
usual
pipe
in
mouth
and
a
tattered
volume
in
his
hand
but
lying
on
his
back
his
arms
crossed
beneath
his
head
staring
into
the
white
curtains
of
which
blanquette
was
so
proud
my
son
said
he
after
he
had
enquired
after
my
welfare
and
my
lunch
and
advised
me
as
to
cooling
medicaments
wherewith
to
mitigate
a
certain
pimplous
condition
of
cheek
my
son
i
want
you
to
make
me
a
promise
swear
that
if
a
hitch
occurs
in
your
scheme
of
the
cosmos
you
will
not
break
up
your
furniture
with
a
crusader
mace
such
a
proceeding
has
infinite
consequences
of
effraction
it
disrupts
your
existence
and
ends
with
the
irreparable
smash
of
your
porcelain
pipe
whereupon
he
asked
me
for
a
cigarette
and
began
to
smoke
reflectively
one
ought
to
order
one
scheme
so
that
no
hitch
can
occur
said
i
as
far
as
i
can
gather
from
the
theologians
that
is
beyond
the
power
even
of
the
almighty
said
paragot
blanquette
appeared
with
the
morning
absinthe
the
hitch
my
son
in
my
case
was
beyond
mortal
control
he
said
looking
up
at
the
you
may
think
that
i
caused
it
in
the
first
place
you
heard
me
last
night
accused
of
cruelty
you
discreet
little
image
that
you
are
know
more
about
things
than
i
thought
and
yet
you
must
wonder
now
that
you
are
nearly
a
man
what
can
be
what
can
have
been
between
this
disreputable
hairy
scallywag
who
is
eating
the
bread
of
idleness
and
with
a
sip
of
his
absinthe
drinking
the
waters
of
destruction
and
that
fair
creature
of
dainty
life
judge
anyone
my
little
asticot
sumus
qui
omnibus
veris
falsa
quædam
esse
dicamus
tanta
similitudine
ut
in
iis
nulla
insit
certe
judicandi
et
assentiendi
that
is
cicero
an
author
to
whom
i
regret
i
have
not
been
able
to
introduce
you
and
it
means
that
the
false
is
so
mingled
with
the
true
and
looks
so
like
it
that
there
is
no
sure
mark
whereby
we
may
distinguish
one
from
the
other
it
is
a
damned
fool
of
a
world
in
this
chastened
mood
i
left
him
i
learned
later
in
the
day
that
the
appearance
of
the
comtesse
in
the
café
delphine
and
the
exodus
of
paragot
had
caused
no
small
sensation
cazalet
had
peeped
through
the
glass
door
nom
de
she
is
driving
him
off
in
her
own
carriage
he
returned
to
the
table
and
drank
a
glass
of
anisette
to
steady
his
nerves
who
was
the
lady
evidently
paragot
was
leading
a
double
life
madame
boin
nodded
her
head
mysteriously
as
though
possessed
of
secrets
she
would
not
divulge
they
spent
the
evening
in
profitless
conjecture
the
fact
remained
that
paragot
the
hairy
disreputable
scallywag
had
relations
with
a
high
born
and
beautiful
woman
it
was
stupefying
abracadabrant
that
was
the
final
word
when
the
quartier
latin
calls
a
thing
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
the
café
delphine
was
far
from
being
the
school
of
discretion
and
good
manners
that
paragot
frequented
in
his
youth
but
such
was
his
personal
influence
that
when
he
reappeared
in
his
usual
place
no
one
dared
allude
to
the
disconcerting
incident
paragot
had
recovered
from
the
chastened
mood
and
was
gay
rabelaisian
and
with
great
gestures
talked
of
all
subjects
under
heaven
one
of
the
international
exhibitions
was
in
prospect
and
many
architects
offices
were
busy
with
projects
for
the
new
buildings
a
discussion
on
these
having
arisen
two
of
our
company
were
architectural
students
paragot
declared
that
the
exhibition
would
be
incomplete
without
a
palais
de
dipsomanie
indeed
it
should
be
the
central
feature
he
cried
i
have
an
inspiration
some
one
give
me
a
soft
black
pencil
hercule
clear
the
table
he
caught
the
napkin
from
beneath
hercule
arm
and
as
soon
as
the
glasses
were
removed
he
dried
the
marble
top
and
holding
the
pencil
draughtsman
fashion
a
couple
of
inches
from
the
point
began
to
draw
with
feverish
haste
his
long
fingers
worked
magically
we
bent
over
him
holding
our
breath
as
gradually
emerged
the
most
marvellous
weird
riotous
dream
of
drunken
architecture
the
world
could
ever
behold
there
were
columns
admirably
indicated
upside
down
the
domes
looked
like
tops
of
half
inflated
balloons
enormous
buttresses
supporting
nothing
leaned
incapable
against
the
building
bottles
and
wine
cups
formed
part
of
the
mad
construction
satyrs
heads
leered
instead
of
windows
the
whole
palace
looked
reeling
drunk
it
was
a
tremendous
feat
of
imagination
and
skill
the
hour
that
he
spent
in
elaborating
it
passed
like
five
minutes
when
he
had
finished
he
threw
down
his
pencil
then
he
called
for
his
drink
and
emptied
the
glass
at
a
gulp
we
all
clamoured
our
admiration
but
paragot
cried
one
of
the
architectural
students
in
considerable
excitement
you
are
a
trained
architect
and
a
great
architect
it
is
the
work
of
a
genius
garnier
himself
could
not
have
done
it
paragot
whipped
up
the
napkin
from
the
seat
and
before
we
could
protest
rubbed
the
drawing
into
a
black
smudge
i
am
a
poet
painter
architect
musician
and
philosopher
bibi
said
he
and
my
name
is
berzélius
nibbidard
paragot
it
was
growing
late
and
we
all
rose
in
a
body
except
paragot
who
made
a
point
of
remaining
after
everyone
had
gone
he
caught
me
by
the
sleeve
stay
a
bit
my
little
asticot
said
he
usually
he
would
not
allow
me
to
remain
late
at
the
café
it
was
bad
for
my
health
and
indeed
i
was
not
supposed
to
waste
my
time
thus
more
than
two
evenings
a
week
paragot
did
not
include
my
seeing
him
make
a
helot
of
himself
as
part
of
my
education
this
was
the
theory
at
the
back
of
his
mind
in
practice
it
had
occurred
at
intervals
since
the
days
or
nights
of
the
lotus
club
paragot
ordered
another
drink
it
was
astonishing
said
he
how
provocative
of
thirst
was
any
diversion
from
the
ordinary
course
of
life
if
the
pig
of
the
café
cordier
had
been
human
he
remarked
he
would
have
sat
down
and
consumed
intoxicating
liquors
instead
of
throwing
himself
under
the
wheels
of
an
omnibus
my
son
he
said
with
solemn
eyes
reverence
that
pig
it
is
few
of
us
who
have
his
courage
and
he
went
on
talking
for
some
time
in
a
strain
clouding
over
with
dim
allusions
the
vital
idea
which
i
verily
believe
had
i
been
a
kind
woman
of
the
world
instead
of
a
raw
youth
of
nineteen
he
would
have
crystallised
with
flaming
speech
i
could
only
listen
to
him
dumbly
vaguely
divinatory
through
my
love
for
him
and
i
suppose
through
a
certain
temperamental
sensitiveness
but
alas
uncomprehending
by
reason
of
my
inexperience
in
the
deeps
of
life
presently
he
announced
that
he
was
ready
to
start
he
walked
somewhat
unsteadily
to
the
door
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
my
little
son
asticot
said
he
on
the
threshold
i
am
so
far
on
my
road
to
immortality
that
i
ought
to
have
in
my
hair
instead
of
which
i
have
wormwood
in
my
heart
will
you
kindly
take
me
to
the
pont
neuf
but
dear
master
said
i
what
on
earth
are
you
going
to
do
there
i
have
something
important
to
say
to
henri
quatre
you
can
say
it
better
i
urged
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
to
the
pont
neuf
said
he
brusquely
pushing
me
away
i
had
to
humour
him
we
started
up
the
boulevard
it
was
drizzling
with
rain
master
we
had
better
go
home
he
did
not
reply
but
strode
on
i
have
a
catlike
dislike
of
rain
i
bear
it
philosophically
but
that
is
all
to
carry
on
a
conversation
during
a
persistent
downpour
is
beyond
my
powers
i
might
as
well
try
to
sing
under
water
paragot
who
ordinarily
was
indifferent
to
the
seasons
difference
and
would
discourse
gaily
in
a
deluge
walked
on
in
silence
we
went
along
amid
the
crowd
past
the
steaming
terraces
of
cafés
whose
lights
set
the
kiosques
in
a
steady
glare
and
sent
shafts
of
yellow
from
the
tops
of
stationary
cabs
and
caught
the
wet
passing
traffic
in
livid
flashes
and
illuminated
faces
to
an
unreal
significance
down
the
silent
quais
frowned
upon
by
the
dim
and
monstrous
masses
of
architecture
guarding
the
seine
like
phantasmagorical
bastions
none
visible
in
outline
but
only
felt
looming
in
the
night
until
we
reached
the
statue
of
paragot
tutelary
king
and
the
rain
fell
miserably
we
were
wet
through
i
put
my
hand
on
his
dripping
sleeve
master
let
me
see
you
home
he
shook
me
off
roughly
you
can
go
but
dear
master
i
implored
he
put
both
hands
behind
his
head
and
threw
out
his
arms
in
a
great
gesture
boy
ca
you
see
cried
he
that
i
am
in
agony
of
soul
i
bent
my
head
and
went
away
god
knows
what
he
said
to
henri
quatre
i
suppose
each
of
us
has
a
pet
gethsemane
of
his
own
one
night
a
few
weeks
later
blanquette
appeared
in
my
little
attic
fired
by
the
example
of
some
of
my
comrades
at
janot
who
showed
glistening
pieces
as
the
rewards
of
industry
i
was
working
up
a
drawing
which
i
fondly
hoped
i
could
sell
to
a
comic
paper
youth
is
the
period
of
insensate
ambitions
i
put
down
my
charcoal
as
blanquette
entered
wise
girl
she
scorned
hats
and
bonnets
and
as
neatly
dressed
as
her
figure
daily
growing
dumpier
would
allow
she
was
laughing
guess
what
your
concierge
said
that
it
was
improper
for
you
to
come
to
see
me
at
this
hour
of
the
night
improper
bah
cried
blanquette
for
whom
such
conventions
existed
not
but
she
told
me
that
it
was
joli
petit
that
i
had
upstairs
what
an
idea
she
laughed
again
you
find
that
funny
i
asked
my
dignity
somewhat
ruffled
i
suppose
i
am
as
pretty
a
little
lover
as
anyone
else
but
you
and
me
asticot
it
is
so
droll
if
you
put
it
that
way
i
admitted
it
is
but
the
concierge
think
it
possible
that
you
are
not
my
why
otherwise
should
you
be
running
in
and
out
of
my
room
as
if
it
belonged
to
you
you
will
be
bringing
a
of
your
own
here
soon
and
then
you
wo
want
blanquette
any
longer
i
dismissed
the
idea
as
one
too
remote
for
contemplation
at
the
same
time
i
reflected
that
i
kissed
a
pretty
model
at
janot
when
we
met
alone
on
the
stairs
i
wondered
whether
the
diabolical
perspicacity
of
women
had
seen
traces
of
the
kiss
on
my
lips
i
disturb
you
she
asked
drawing
up
my
other
wooden
chair
to
the
deal
table
and
sitting
down
why
no
i
can
work
while
you
talk
she
put
her
elbow
on
a
couple
of
pickled
gherkins
that
remained
casually
on
the
table
after
a
perambulatory
meal
oh
how
dirty
men
are
you
are
worse
than
the
master
oh
la
la
and
he
puts
his
boots
and
his
dirty
plates
together
on
his
bed
it
is
time
that
you
did
have
a
to
keep
the
place
in
order
i
believe
you
really
do
want
to
come
here
in
that
capacity
i
said
laughingly
she
flushed
at
the
jest
and
drew
herself
up
you
have
no
right
to
say
that
asticot
i
would
sooner
be
the
master
servant
than
the
mistress
or
even
the
wife
of
any
man
living
he
is
everything
to
me
my
little
asticot
everything
do
you
hear
although
he
loves
me
just
as
he
loves
you
and
narcisse
ne
faut
pas
te
moquer
de
you
must
not
laugh
at
me
it
hurts
me
it
was
only
then
for
the
first
time
that
i
realised
in
blanquette
a
grown
woman
hitherto
i
had
regarded
her
merely
as
a
female
waif
picked
up
like
the
dog
and
myself
under
paragot
vagabond
arm
and
attached
to
him
by
ties
of
gratitude
now
lo
and
behold
she
was
a
woman
talking
of
deep
things
with
a
treacherous
throb
in
her
voice
i
reached
across
the
table
and
took
one
of
her
coarse
hands
tu
donc
ma
pauvre
blanquette
i
exclaimed
in
sympathy
and
consternation
she
looked
down
and
nodded
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
a
tear
fell
on
my
hand
i
knew
still
less
then
crying
out
she
was
very
unhappy
she
began
to
sob
he
does
not
want
me
even
to
pass
the
time
it
has
never
entered
his
head
i
am
too
ugly
i
do
not
demand
that
he
should
love
me
it
would
be
asking
for
the
moon
but
he
does
love
you
like
a
father
i
said
in
vain
consolation
i
love
him
like
a
son
and
you
should
love
him
like
a
daughter
she
did
not
even
condescend
to
notice
this
counsel
of
perfection
she
was
too
ugly
she
was
built
like
a
hayrick
the
master
had
never
cast
his
eyes
on
her
as
doubtless
he
would
have
done
being
a
man
had
she
any
of
the
qualities
of
allurement
she
suffered
poor
blanquette
from
the
injuria
with
reason
even
more
solid
than
the
forsaken
dido
she
was
humble
she
sobbed
she
did
not
demand
a
bit
of
love
bigger
than
that
and
she
clicked
her
finger
nail
with
that
she
would
be
proud
and
happy
if
the
master
were
as
gay
as
he
used
to
be
i
should
not
mind
she
said
lifting
a
grotesquely
stained
face
but
when
he
goes
drinking
drinking
so
as
to
drown
his
love
for
another
woman
plus
fort
que
it
is
more
than
i
can
bear
which
other
woman
you
know
very
well
that
beautiful
lady
she
has
come
more
than
once
to
fetch
him
away
she
is
a
wicked
woman
for
she
does
not
love
him
she
even
detests
him
one
can
see
that
i
should
like
to
kill
her
cried
blanquette
the
idea
of
anyone
wanting
to
kill
joanna
was
so
novel
that
i
stared
at
her
speechless
it
took
some
time
for
my
wits
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
point
of
view
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
not
drink
myself
to
death
for
the
sake
of
a
woman
who
treated
me
so
she
remarked
recovering
her
composure
is
it
as
bad
as
that
i
asked
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
men
must
drink
it
is
their
nature
but
there
should
be
limits
one
ought
to
be
reasonable
even
a
man
did
i
not
think
so
in
her
matter
of
fact
way
she
gave
me
details
of
habits
the
one
morning
absinthe
had
grown
to
two
or
three
there
was
brandy
too
in
his
bedroom
and
it
eats
such
a
deal
of
money
my
little
asticot
she
remarked
after
which
to
relieve
her
feelings
she
washed
up
my
dirty
plates
and
discoursed
on
the
economics
of
catering
i
walked
with
her
through
the
two
or
three
streets
that
separated
me
from
the
rue
des
saladiers
and
went
upstairs
with
her
to
see
whether
paragot
had
returned
it
was
past
midnight
there
was
no
paragot
i
went
to
the
café
delphine
profoundly
depressed
by
blanquette
story
here
was
blanquette
eating
her
heart
out
for
paragot
who
was
killing
his
soul
for
joanna
who
was
miserably
unhappy
on
account
of
her
husband
who
was
suffering
some
penalty
for
his
vulturedom
it
was
a
kind
of
tale
of
misery
of
which
i
seemed
to
be
the
foundation
save
for
paragot
the
café
was
empty
he
was
asleep
in
his
usual
corner
breathing
stertorously
his
head
against
the
wall
madame
boin
on
her
throne
was
busy
over
accounts
hercule
dozed
at
a
table
by
the
door
his
napkin
in
the
crook
of
his
arm
he
nodded
towards
paragot
as
i
entered
and
made
a
helpless
gesture
i
looked
at
the
huddled
figure
against
the
wall
and
wondered
how
the
deuce
i
was
to
take
him
home
i
had
no
money
to
pay
for
a
cab
i
tried
in
vain
to
rouse
him
monsieur
had
better
let
him
stay
here
said
hercule
it
wo
be
the
first
time
my
heart
grew
even
heavier
than
it
was
before
no
wonder
poor
blanquette
was
dismayed
he
will
catch
his
death
of
cold
when
the
morning
comes
said
i
for
the
night
was
fresh
and
three
years
of
warm
lying
had
softened
the
paragot
of
vagrant
days
one
must
die
sooner
or
later
moralised
hercule
inhumanly
i
shook
my
master
again
he
grunted
i
shook
him
more
violently
to
my
relief
he
opened
his
eyes
smiled
at
me
and
waved
a
limp
salutation
the
palace
of
dipsomania
he
murmured
no
master
said
i
this
is
the
café
delphine
and
you
live
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
it
is
a
nuisance
to
live
anywhere
i
was
born
to
be
a
bird
to
roost
on
trees
i
had
considerable
difficulty
in
disentangling
the
words
from
his
thick
speech
he
shut
his
eyes
then
opened
them
again
how
does
a
drunken
owl
stay
on
his
twig
as
i
felt
no
interest
in
the
domestic
habits
of
dissolute
owls
i
set
about
getting
him
home
i
took
his
green
hat
from
the
peg
and
put
it
on
his
head
and
with
hercule
help
drew
away
the
table
and
set
him
on
his
feet
a
man
like
that
it
goes
to
my
heart
said
madame
boin
in
a
low
voice
i
felt
unreasonably
angry
that
any
one
save
myself
or
perhaps
blanquette
should
pity
my
beloved
master
i
did
not
answer
whereby
i
am
afraid
i
was
rude
to
the
good
madame
boin
paragot
lurched
forward
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
hercule
caught
and
steadied
him
broken
ankle
explained
paragot
you
must
try
to
walk
master
i
urged
anxiously
how
was
i
going
to
get
him
to
the
rue
des
saladiers
his
arm
round
my
neck
weighed
cruelly
on
my
frail
body
put
best
foot
forward
he
murmured
making
a
step
and
pausing
that
is
very
easy
but
the
devil
of
it
is
when
time
comes
for
worst
foot
try
it
for
goodness
sake
said
i
he
tried
it
with
a
silly
laugh
then
the
swing
door
of
the
café
opened
and
joanna
with
her
sweet
frightened
face
appeared
on
the
threshold
chapter
xiii
the
sight
of
joanna
froze
paragot
into
momentary
sobriety
he
stood
rigid
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
swayed
into
a
chair
by
one
of
the
tables
and
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
i
went
up
to
joanna
he
ca
come
madame
why
not
he
is
not
fit
as
she
realised
my
meaning
a
look
of
great
pain
and
repulsion
passed
over
her
face
but
he
must
come
perhaps
he
will
be
better
presently
you
will
accompany
us
and
help
me
asticot
wo
you
as
usual
the
frost
melted
from
her
eyes
and
her
voice
the
silvery
english
voice
went
to
my
heart
i
bent
over
paragot
and
whispered
take
her
from
this
pigstye
and
the
sight
of
the
hog
muttered
paragot
his
hands
were
clenched
in
a
mighty
effort
to
concentrate
his
wits
joanna
approached
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
gaston
suddenly
he
relaxed
his
grip
and
broke
into
a
stupid
laugh
very
well
what
does
it
matter
sorry
have
got
velveteen
suit
what
does
he
say
she
asked
turning
to
me
that
he
will
come
madame
said
hercule
aided
me
to
him
out
of
the
café
and
across
the
pavement
to
the
waiting
carriage
joanna
took
her
seat
by
his
side
and
i
sat
opposite
hercule
shut
the
carriage
door
and
we
drove
off
paragot
relapsed
into
stupor
i
do
know
how
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
asticot
for
keeping
you
out
of
your
bed
at
this
time
of
night
said
joanna
but
i
am
very
friendless
here
in
paris
we
went
along
the
boul
mich
by
the
quais
to
the
pont
de
la
concorde
crossed
the
vast
and
now
silent
expanse
of
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
going
by
the
rue
royale
and
the
long
dull
boulevard
malesherbes
and
the
boulevard
haussmann
entered
the
avenue
de
messine
it
is
a
long
drive
under
the
most
cheerful
circumstances
but
at
one
in
the
morning
in
the
company
of
the
dearest
thing
in
the
world
to
me
half
drunk
and
the
dear
lady
whom
he
worshipped
horrified
and
disgusted
at
the
thought
thereof
it
seemed
interminable
at
last
we
arrived
at
no
at
my
ring
the
door
swung
open
drawn
by
the
concierge
within
i
helped
paragot
out
of
the
carriage
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
stand
and
walk
steadily
heaven
knows
how
he
managed
to
clamber
with
not
too
great
indecency
up
the
stairs
to
the
comte
de
verneuil
flat
on
the
first
floor
joanna
opened
the
door
with
her
latch
key
and
we
entered
a
drawing
room
let
me
sit
down
said
paragot
i
shall
be
better
presently
he
sank
an
ashamed
heap
on
a
sofa
by
the
wall
and
with
his
fingers
through
his
long
black
hair
fought
for
mastery
over
his
intoxication
the
comtesse
de
verneuil
left
us
and
presently
returned
having
taken
off
her
hat
and
evening
wrap
she
brought
a
little
silver
tray
with
madeira
wine
and
biscuits
we
need
something
asticot
she
said
graciously
we
drank
the
wine
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
paragot
recovery
although
it
was
late
may
a
wood
fire
glowed
beneath
the
great
this
made
of
blue
and
white
ware
with
corbels
of
cherubs
caught
my
attention
i
had
seen
things
like
it
in
the
stately
museums
of
italy
but
this
is
della
robbia
i
exclaimed
she
smiled
somewhat
surprised
you
are
a
connoisseur
as
well
as
a
philosopher
asticot
yes
it
is
della
robbia
the
comte
de
verneuil
is
a
great
collector
then
for
the
first
time
i
looked
about
the
room
and
i
caught
my
breath
as
i
realised
its
wealth
and
luxury
for
a
time
i
forgot
paragot
lost
in
a
dream
of
florentine
tapestries
priceless
cabinets
porcelain
silver
pictures
richly
toned
rugs
chairs
with
rhythmic
lines
all
softened
into
harmonious
mystery
by
the
shaded
light
of
the
lamps
at
the
end
of
a
further
room
just
visible
through
the
looped
curtains
a
great
piece
of
statuary
gleamed
white
i
had
never
entered
such
a
room
in
my
life
before
my
master
had
taken
me
through
the
show
apartments
of
great
houses
and
palaces
but
they
were
uninhabited
wanted
the
human
touch
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
men
and
women
could
have
such
wonder
as
their
daily
environment
or
could
invest
it
with
the
indefinable
charm
of
intimacy
i
turned
and
looked
at
joanna
as
she
sat
by
the
della
robbia
gracious
and
distinguished
and
joanna
became
merged
in
the
countess
de
verneuil
the
great
lady
as
far
removed
from
me
as
my
little
bare
attic
from
this
treasure
house
of
luxury
she
wore
the
room
so
to
speak
as
i
wore
the
attic
overcome
by
sudden
timidity
i
could
barely
reply
to
her
remarks
she
was
in
no
mood
for
conversation
poor
lady
so
there
dropped
upon
us
a
dead
silence
during
which
she
stared
frozenly
into
the
fire
while
i
afraid
to
move
occupied
the
time
by
storing
in
my
memory
every
bewitching
detail
of
her
dress
and
person
the
oil
sketch
of
her
i
made
a
day
or
two
afterwards
hangs
before
me
as
i
write
these
lines
i
prided
myself
on
having
caught
the
colour
of
her
hair
black
with
the
blue
reflections
like
the
blue
of
cigarette
smoke
suddenly
the
quietness
was
startled
by
loud
groans
of
agony
and
unintelligible
speech
coming
from
some
room
of
the
flat
paragot
staggered
noisily
to
his
feet
a
shaking
hairy
dishevelled
spectre
blinking
glazed
eyes
madame
de
verneuil
started
and
leaned
forward
her
hands
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
my
husband
she
whispered
and
for
a
few
seconds
we
all
listened
to
the
unearthly
sounds
then
she
rose
and
turned
to
me
you
had
better
see
it
through
she
crossed
to
paragot
are
you
better
now
i
can
do
what
is
required
of
me
said
my
master
humbly
though
in
his
ordinary
voice
he
was
practically
sober
then
come
said
joanna
we
followed
her
out
of
the
room
through
softly
carpeted
corridors
full
of
pictures
and
statues
and
beautiful
vases
and
entered
a
dimly
lit
bedroom
a
nurse
rose
from
a
chair
by
the
bed
where
lay
a
man
groaning
and
raving
in
some
terrible
madness
joanna
gripped
my
arm
as
paragot
went
to
the
bedside
i
am
gaston
de
nérac
said
he
the
comte
de
verneuil
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
looked
at
him
in
a
wild
way
i
too
should
have
liked
to
grip
someone
arm
for
the
sight
of
the
man
sent
a
shudder
through
me
but
i
braced
myself
up
under
the
consoling
idea
that
i
was
protecting
joanna
you
are
not
dead
then
i
did
not
kill
you
said
the
comte
de
verneuil
no
since
i
am
here
to
tell
you
that
i
am
alive
the
sweat
poured
off
the
man
face
he
lay
back
exhausted
i
do
not
know
why
he
gasped
but
i
thought
i
had
killed
you
he
closed
his
eyes
that
is
enough
said
the
nurse
without
a
word
we
all
returned
to
the
it
was
an
astounding
comedy
i
am
grateful
said
joanna
to
my
master
i
wish
there
were
some
means
of
repaying
you
i
thought
said
he
with
a
touch
of
irony
which
she
did
not
notice
that
it
was
i
who
was
paying
for
a
wrong
i
did
you
she
drew
herself
up
and
surveyed
him
from
head
to
foot
with
a
little
air
of
disdain
i
forget
she
said
icily
that
you
ever
did
me
any
wrong
and
i
ca
said
he
i
wish
to
heaven
i
could
you
beheld
me
in
the
process
of
trying
an
unedifying
sight
for
madame
la
comtesse
de
verneuil
an
unedifying
sight
for
anybody
said
joanna
he
bowed
his
head
something
pathetic
in
his
attitude
touched
her
she
was
a
woman
her
hand
caught
his
sleeve
gaston
why
have
you
come
down
to
this
you
of
all
men
because
i
am
the
one
poor
fool
of
all
poor
fools
who
takes
life
seriously
joanna
sighed
i
ca
understand
you
is
there
any
necessity
you
belong
to
a
time
when
one
wanted
to
understand
everything
now
nothing
much
matters
but
curiously
in
your
case
the
desire
has
returned
you
understood
me
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
when
you
wanted
me
i
would
be
at
your
service
i
do
know
she
said
it
was
a
desperate
resort
to
save
my
husband
reason
oh
come
she
cried
moving
to
the
chairs
by
the
fire
let
us
sit
and
talk
for
five
minutes
the
other
times
you
came
and
went
and
we
scarcely
spoke
a
word
besides
with
a
forced
laugh
it
would
not
have
been
now
asticot
is
here
as
chaperon
it
does
seem
like
real
life
does
it
that
you
and
i
should
be
here
it
is
like
some
grotesque
dream
in
which
all
sorts
of
incoherences
are
mixed
up
together
do
you
at
least
find
it
interesting
as
interesting
as
toothache
replied
paragot
if
it
is
pain
for
you
to
talk
to
me
gaston
i
will
not
detain
you
said
joanna
rising
from
her
chair
forgive
me
said
he
i
suppose
my
manners
have
gone
with
the
rest
you
may
help
me
to
recover
them
if
you
allow
me
to
talk
to
you
he
passed
his
hand
wearily
over
his
face
which
during
the
last
minute
or
two
had
been
overspread
by
a
queer
pallor
he
looked
ghastly
tell
me
said
he
why
you
come
to
that
of
a
place
a
note
would
reach
me
and
i
would
obey
she
explained
that
there
was
no
time
for
the
attacks
came
on
suddenly
at
night
to
soothe
him
it
was
necessary
to
find
the
chief
actor
in
the
absurd
comedy
at
once
at
any
cost
to
her
reputation
besides
what
did
it
matter
the
only
person
who
knew
of
her
escapade
was
the
coachman
an
old
family
servant
of
the
comte
as
discreet
as
death
how
long
have
these
attacks
been
going
on
asked
my
master
joanna
poured
out
her
story
with
the
pathetic
eagerness
of
a
woman
who
has
kept
hateful
secrets
in
her
heart
too
long
and
at
last
finds
a
human
soul
in
whom
she
can
confide
i
think
she
almost
forgot
my
presence
for
i
sat
modestly
apart
separated
from
them
by
the
wide
cone
of
light
cast
by
the
shaded
lamp
the
first
symptoms
of
mental
derangement
she
said
had
manifested
themselves
two
years
ago
they
had
gradually
increased
in
frequency
and
intensity
during
the
interval
the
comte
de
verneuil
went
about
the
world
a
sane
man
the
attacks
as
she
had
explained
came
on
suddenly
always
at
night
and
his
fixed
idea
was
that
he
had
killed
gaston
de
nérac
before
paragot
had
appeared
they
lasted
two
or
three
days
till
they
spent
themselves
leaving
the
patient
in
great
bodily
prostration
when
she
had
met
me
taking
the
spring
outside
the
hôtel
bristol
a
wild
idea
had
entered
her
head
that
the
confrontation
of
the
comte
with
the
living
gaston
de
nérac
might
end
his
madness
on
the
occasion
of
the
next
attack
she
had
rushed
in
eager
search
for
paragot
had
brought
him
to
the
raving
bedside
and
the
result
had
been
magical
she
had
thought
the
cure
permanent
but
a
fortnight
later
the
attack
returned
as
it
had
returned
again
and
again
and
as
it
had
returned
it
is
charitable
of
you
to
have
come
gaston
she
said
in
her
sweet
way
and
i
must
ask
you
to
forgive
me
for
anything
unkind
i
may
have
said
he
made
some
reply
in
a
low
voice
which
i
did
not
hear
and
for
a
little
time
their
talk
was
pitched
in
the
same
tone
i
began
to
grow
sleepy
i
aroused
myself
with
a
jerk
to
hear
joanna
say
why
did
you
play
that
detestable
tune
from
aux
enfers
to
see
if
you
would
recognise
it
some
mocking
devil
prompted
me
it
was
the
last
tune
you
and
i
heard
together
the
night
of
our
engagement
party
the
band
played
it
in
the
garden
do
do
exclaimed
joanna
putting
up
her
hands
to
her
face
this
then
was
why
each
had
cried
out
at
against
the
merry
little
tune
it
was
interesting
i
saw
however
that
it
must
have
jangled
horribly
on
tense
nerves
she
dashed
away
her
hands
suddenly
and
strained
her
face
towards
him
why
gaston
why
did
you
he
rose
with
a
deprecating
gesture
and
there
was
a
hunted
look
in
his
eyes
during
all
this
strange
scene
he
was
no
longer
paragot
my
master
but
gaston
de
nérac
whom
i
did
not
know
his
wild
picturesque
speech
his
dear
vagabond
manner
had
gone
the
haggardness
of
some
desperate
illness
changed
his
features
and
i
grew
frightened
i
came
to
his
side
master
we
must
take
a
cab
have
you
any
money
yes
he
said
faintly
let
us
go
home
but
you
are
ill
you
look
as
white
as
a
ghost
cried
joanna
in
alarm
i
had
a
dinner
of
herbs
in
the
liquid
form
of
absinthe
said
my
master
with
a
clutch
at
paragot
how
does
it
go
better
a
dinner
of
herbs
where
love
is
ah
monsieur
has
not
yet
gone
said
the
nurse
hurrying
into
the
room
monsieur
le
comte
begs
me
to
give
this
to
monsieur
she
held
out
a
letter
monsieur
le
comte
made
me
open
his
despatch
box
madame
she
added
apologetically
she
left
the
room
paragot
stood
twirling
the
letter
between
his
fingers
joanna
bade
him
open
it
it
might
be
something
important
paragot
drew
from
the
envelope
half
a
sheet
of
he
looked
at
it
made
a
staggering
step
to
the
door
and
fell
sprawling
prone
upon
the
carpet
joanna
uttered
a
little
cry
of
fright
and
as
i
did
cast
herself
on
her
knees
beside
him
he
had
fainted
abstinence
from
food
drink
his
tremendous
effort
of
will
towards
sobriety
the
strain
of
the
interview
had
brought
him
to
the
verge
of
the
precipice
and
it
only
required
the
shock
of
the
letter
to
send
him
toppling
over
we
propped
his
head
on
cushions
and
loosened
his
collar
what
can
we
do
gasped
my
dear
lady
i
will
call
the
nurse
from
monsieur
le
comte
room
said
i
she
will
know
said
joanna
hopefully
i
went
to
the
comte
room
opened
the
door
and
beckoned
to
the
nurse
she
gave
a
glance
at
her
sleeping
patient
and
joined
me
in
the
corridor
on
my
explanation
she
brought
water
and
and
returned
with
me
to
the
it
was
a
night
of
stupefying
surprises
the
would
have
called
it
and
they
would
not
have
been
far
wrong
there
was
necromancy
in
the
air
i
felt
it
as
i
followed
the
nurse
across
the
threshold
i
anticipated
something
odd
some
grotesque
development
in
the
atmosphere
of
those
i
loved
in
those
days
i
was
as
sensitive
as
a
barometer
paragot
lay
still
as
death
his
wild
hairy
head
on
the
satin
cushions
but
joanna
was
crouching
on
her
knees
in
the
midst
of
the
cone
of
light
cast
by
the
shaded
lamp
reading
with
parted
lips
and
blanched
face
the
half
sheet
of
as
we
entered
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
and
her
eyes
were
frozen
hard
blue
the
nurse
bent
over
by
my
side
joanna
stretched
out
her
arms
full
length
towards
me
read
she
cried
and
her
voice
was
harsh
with
no
silvery
tone
in
it
at
all
i
took
the
paper
wonderingly
from
her
fingers
why
she
should
have
shown
it
to
me
the
wretched
little
art
student
i
could
not
conceive
for
many
of
the
after
years
during
which
i
wrestled
with
the
and
perplexities
of
women
but
experience
has
taught
me
that
human
beings
of
whichever
sex
they
may
be
will
do
amazing
things
in
times
of
spiritual
upheaval
i
have
known
the
primmest
of
vicar
churchwardens
curse
like
a
when
a
new
incumbent
chose
in
his
stead
a
less
prim
man
than
he
i
was
just
a
human
entity
i
suppose
who
had
strayed
into
the
sacred
and
intimate
sphere
of
her
life
the
only
one
perhaps
in
the
world
who
had
done
so
she
was
stricken
to
the
soul
instinct
compelled
my
sharing
of
her
pain
she
commanded
me
to
read
i
was
only
nineteen
had
she
commanded
me
to
drink
up
eisel
or
eat
a
crocodile
i
would
have
done
it
i
read
the
address
of
the
letter
was
eaton
square
the
date
the
of
june
thirteen
years
before
the
wording
as
follows
in
consideration
of
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
pounds
i
the
undersigned
gaston
de
nérac
promise
and
undertake
from
this
moment
not
to
hold
any
communication
by
word
or
writing
with
miss
joanna
rushworth
for
the
space
of
two
years
that
is
to
say
until
midnight
of
the
june
should
however
miss
joanna
rushworth
be
married
in
the
meantime
i
solemnly
undertake
on
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
not
of
my
own
free
will
to
hold
any
communication
with
her
whatever
as
long
as
i
live
or
should
circumstances
force
us
to
meet
not
to
acquaint
her
in
any
way
with
the
terms
of
this
agreement
whereof
i
hold
myself
bound
by
the
spirit
as
well
as
by
the
letter
gaston
de
nérac
my
young
and
unpractised
mind
required
some
minutes
to
realise
the
meaning
of
this
precious
agreement
when
it
had
done
so
i
stared
blankly
at
joanna
the
nurse
in
her
businesslike
fashion
drew
the
curtains
and
flung
the
french
windows
wide
open
he
has
only
fainted
he
will
soon
come
round
she
returned
to
paragot
side
joanna
and
i
remained
staring
at
each
other
she
rose
took
me
by
the
sleeve
and
dragged
me
to
the
fireplace
the
writing
is
my
husband
she
said
in
a
whisper
the
signature
is
his
pointing
to
paragot
he
sold
me
to
my
husband
for
ten
thousand
pounds
on
the
evening
of
our
engagement
party
what
am
i
to
do
i
have
a
friend
in
this
hateful
country
i
longed
to
tell
her
she
had
at
least
one
friend
but
as
i
could
neither
help
nor
advise
her
i
said
nothing
no
wonder
he
has
a
banking
account
she
said
with
a
bitter
laugh
i
noticed
then
that
a
strained
woman
humour
is
unpleasant
she
sat
down
the
corners
of
her
kind
lips
quivered
the
world
is
turned
upside
down
she
said
piteously
there
is
no
love
honour
or
loyalty
in
it
i
felt
this
evening
as
if
i
could
forgive
him
but
now
she
rose
and
wrung
her
hands
and
exclaimed
sharply
oh
it
hateful
it
hateful
for
men
to
be
so
base
that
it
was
a
base
action
to
sell
joanna
for
any
sum
of
money
however
bewildering
in
largeness
i
could
not
deny
but
that
paragot
should
have
been
guilty
of
it
i
would
not
have
believed
had
the
accusation
come
from
joanna
own
lips
the
confounded
scrap
of
paper
however
was
proof
therein
he
had
pledged
himself
to
give
up
joanna
for
ten
thousand
pounds
and
the
vulture
had
paid
the
money
i
turned
away
sadly
and
went
to
help
the
nurse
minister
to
my
master
he
opened
his
eyes
and
whispered
that
i
must
fetch
a
cab
or
a
he
added
characteristically
glad
of
action
i
went
out
into
the
long
quiet
avenue
and
after
five
minutes
walk
hailed
a
passing
fiacre
the
nurse
admitted
me
when
i
rang
the
bell
i
found
paragot
sitting
on
the
sofa
by
the
wall
and
joanna
where
i
had
left
her
by
the
della
robbia
apparently
they
had
not
had
a
very
companionable
five
minutes
he
rose
as
i
entered
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
said
he
let
us
go
i
must
say
to
madame
be
quick
about
it
he
whispered
i
crossed
the
room
to
joanna
chair
and
made
a
french
bow
according
to
my
instruction
in
manners
good
night
madame
she
held
out
her
hand
to
me
such
a
delicate
soft
little
hand
but
quite
cold
and
nerveless
good
night
asticot
i
am
sorry
our
friendship
has
been
so
short
i
joined
paragot
he
said
from
where
he
stood
by
the
door
good
night
madame
la
comtesse
she
made
no
reply
instinctively
both
of
us
lingered
a
second
on
the
threshold
filling
our
eyes
with
the
beauty
and
luxury
that
were
all
part
and
parcel
of
joanna
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
us
we
felt
like
two
bad
angels
turned
out
of
paradise
chapter
xiv
i
came
across
him
the
next
afternoon
sitting
on
a
stone
bench
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
his
hat
was
slouched
forward
over
his
eyes
his
hand
supported
his
chin
so
that
his
long
straggling
beard
protruded
in
a
curious
egyptian
horizontality
his
boots
innocent
as
usual
of
blacking
for
he
would
not
allow
blanquette
to
touch
them
were
stuck
out
ostentatiously
and
to
the
peril
of
the
near
he
had
never
during
our
acquaintance
manifested
any
sense
of
the
dandified
on
our
travels
he
had
worn
the
casual
unnoticeable
dress
of
the
peasant
save
when
he
had
masqueraded
in
the
velveteens
in
london
a
swaggering
air
of
braggadocio
had
set
off
his
bohemian
garb
but
never
had
the
demoralised
disreputability
of
paragot
struck
me
until
i
saw
him
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
everything
else
wore
a
startlingly
fresh
appearance
after
the
heavy
rains
the
gravel
walk
had
the
prim
neatness
of
a
peter
de
hoogh
garden
path
the
white
balustrades
and
flights
of
steps
around
the
great
circle
the
statuary
and
the
fountains
in
the
middle
lake
flashed
pure
the
enormous
white
caps
of
nurses
their
gay
silk
streamers
fluttering
behind
them
the
children
the
light
summer
dresses
of
women
the
patches
of
white
newspaper
held
by
other
loungers
on
the
seats
a
dazzling
bit
of
scudding
across
the
clear
paris
sky
the
pale
dome
of
the
panthéon
rising
to
the
east
the
background
of
the
luxembourg
itself
in
which
one
was
only
conscious
of
the
high
lights
on
the
long
bold
cornices
all
set
the
key
of
the
picture
and
gave
it
symphonic
value
the
eye
rejected
everything
but
the
whites
and
the
pearl
greys
subordinating
all
other
tones
to
its
impression
of
fantastic
purity
and
there
like
an
ink
blot
splashed
on
the
picture
sat
paragot
the
very
foulest
of
montesquieu
esprit
des
lois
which
could
be
picked
up
on
the
quays
lay
unopened
on
his
knee
not
until
narcisse
who
was
sleeping
at
his
feet
jumped
up
and
barked
a
welcome
around
me
did
paragot
notice
my
approach
he
held
out
his
hand
and
the
seemed
longer
and
dirtier
than
ever
he
drew
me
down
to
the
seat
beside
him
you
were
asleep
when
i
ran
in
this
morning
master
said
i
apologetically
for
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
him
that
day
since
then
i
have
been
thinking
my
little
asticot
it
is
a
vain
occupation
for
a
may
afternoon
and
it
makes
your
head
ache
i
should
be
much
better
employed
carting
manure
for
madame
dubosc
we
earned
two
francs
do
you
remember
i
remember
that
my
back
ached
terribly
afterwards
said
i
laughing
ah
but
the
ease
and
comfort
in
your
soul
perhaps
there
nothing
much
the
matter
with
yours
yet
is
there
i
think
it
all
right
i
answered
something
must
be
wrong
with
mine
he
remarked
meditatively
because
at
a
crisis
in
my
life
i
have
had
an
inspiration
it
is
sluggish
i
want
a
soul
pill
this
time
it
was
i
who
had
an
inspiration
one
of
terrifying
audacity
master
perhaps
absinthe
is
good
for
it
said
i
all
in
a
breath
infant
solomon
replied
paragot
ironically
where
have
you
gathered
such
a
store
of
wisdom
have
you
a
scrap
of
paper
in
your
pocket
yes
master
said
i
producing
a
and
preparing
to
tear
out
a
leaf
he
stopped
my
hand
leave
it
in
all
the
better
as
i
am
sure
you
do
remember
the
passage
from
cicero
natura
which
i
quoted
to
you
some
time
ago
since
you
are
unacquainted
with
the
latin
tongue
i
will
dictate
it
to
you
and
you
can
learn
it
by
heart
and
say
it
like
a
pater
or
an
ave
morning
and
evening
i
wrote
down
at
his
dictation
the
passage
concerning
the
impossibility
of
judging
between
the
false
and
true
and
that
is
how
i
was
able
to
set
it
down
in
its
proper
place
in
a
previous
chapter
do
you
know
why
i
have
made
you
do
this
yes
master
said
i
for
i
knew
that
he
referred
to
the
sale
of
joanna
for
ten
thousand
pounds
circumstance
flattens
a
man
out
sometimes
said
he
like
a
ribbon
as
if
he
had
been
carefully
ironed
by
a
hot
steam
roller
i
suppose
a
flattened
man
ca
have
an
inspiration
i
am
my
own
and
you
can
chalk
across
me
jacet
qui
olim
paragotus
his
tone
was
so
dejected
that
i
felt
a
sinking
at
my
heart
a
scratchiness
in
my
nose
and
a
wateriness
in
my
eyes
i
suffered
the
pangs
of
suppressed
sympathy
what
could
a
boy
of
nineteen
say
or
do
in
order
to
restore
rotundity
to
a
flattened
hero
years
ago
he
continued
after
a
pause
i
found
the
world
a
lie
and
i
started
off
to
chase
the
wild
goose
of
truth
i
captured
nothing
but
a
taste
for
alcohol
which
brought
me
eventually
beneath
the
steam
roller
were
it
not
the
silliest
legend
invented
by
man
i
should
say
to
you
of
the
steam
roller
but
if
a
man
sober
he
can
see
the
thing
himself
if
he
is
he
ca
read
the
warning
i
can
only
tell
you
to
be
unalcoholic
and
you
be
happy
you
see
my
little
son
asticot
to
what
depths
i
have
descended
in
that
i
can
be
the
apostle
of
the
platitudinous
he
leaned
forward
chin
on
knuckles
and
his
beard
again
stuck
out
horizontally
happy
people
passed
us
by
for
many
the
work
of
the
day
was
already
over
and
they
had
the
lingering
magic
of
the
sunshine
for
their
own
a
young
workman
and
a
girl
hanging
on
his
arm
brushed
close
by
our
seat
nous
aurons
des
enfants
et
de
beaux
she
cried
i
hope
they
will
said
paragot
looking
at
them
wistfully
then
after
a
pause
has
the
comtesse
de
verneuil
any
children
no
master
said
i
in
a
tone
of
conviction
it
struck
me
later
that
i
had
spoken
from
blank
ignorance
but
at
the
moment
the
question
seemed
preposterous
in
many
ways
i
had
still
the
unreasoning
instincts
of
a
child
because
i
had
never
contemplated
my
dear
lady
joanna
in
the
light
of
a
mother
i
unhesitatingly
proclaimed
her
childless
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
right
paragot
satisfied
with
my
reply
watched
the
endless
stream
of
cheerful
folk
once
he
quoted
to
himself
golden
foot
of
may
is
on
the
flowers
and
on
the
heads
of
all
but
me
suddenly
he
sat
back
and
seized
me
by
the
arm
asticot
you
are
a
man
now
and
you
must
see
things
with
the
eyes
of
a
man
i
have
loved
you
like
my
son
if
you
should
turn
away
thinking
evil
things
of
me
like
someone
else
it
would
break
my
heart
neither
she
nor
you
ought
to
have
seen
that
accursed
paper
you
and
blanquette
and
the
dog
are
all
i
have
in
the
world
to
care
for
and
i
want
you
all
to
think
well
of
me
then
the
tears
did
spring
into
my
eyes
for
my
beloved
master
appeal
went
home
to
that
which
was
truest
and
best
in
me
i
stammered
out
something
i
know
not
what
but
it
came
from
my
heart
it
pleased
him
he
jumped
to
his
feet
in
his
old
impetuous
way
bravo
asticot
de
mon
the
nightmare
is
over
and
we
can
enjoy
the
sunshine
again
we
will
drag
blanquette
from
the
rue
des
saladiers
which
does
not
lay
itself
out
for
jollity
and
we
will
dine
at
a
reckless
restaurant
blanquette
shall
eat
the
snails
which
she
adores
and
i
shall
eat
pig
feet
and
you
an
underdone
beefsteak
to
nourish
your
little
body
and
we
shall
all
eat
with
our
dinner
pain
bénit
de
la
he
strode
off
eager
as
usual
to
put
his
idea
into
immediate
execution
he
talked
all
the
way
to
the
rue
des
saladiers
poor
blanquette
he
had
been
neglecting
her
a
girl
of
her
age
needed
some
amusement
we
would
go
to
the
théâtre
the
porte
like
good
bourgeois
and
see
a
melodrama
so
that
blanquette
could
weep
they
are
playing
eventreurs
de
paris
i
hear
they
rip
each
other
up
on
the
stage
and
everybody
is
reeking
with
blood
good
honest
red
blood
carried
in
bladders
under
their
costumes
my
son
you
turn
up
what
you
can
of
your
snub
little
superior
artistic
nose
but
blanquette
will
be
in
paradise
blanquette
was
in
the
slip
of
a
kitchen
and
a
flurried
temper
when
we
entered
but
master
you
said
you
would
not
be
home
for
dinner
there
is
nothing
in
the
house
only
this
which
i
was
cooking
for
myself
and
she
dived
her
fork
into
the
pot
and
brought
up
on
the
prongs
a
diminutive
piece
of
beef
and
now
you
and
asticot
demand
dinner
as
if
dinners
came
out
of
the
pot
of
their
own
accord
ah
men
they
are
always
like
that
i
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
we
are
all
dining
out
together
blanquette
but
if
you
do
want
to
come
you
shall
stay
at
home
and
without
dinner
said
paragot
taking
the
fork
from
her
hand
and
throwing
the
meat
to
narcisse
mais
non
cried
blanquette
whose
sense
of
economy
was
outraged
but
when
narcisse
sprang
on
the
beef
and
finding
it
too
hot
lay
growling
at
it
until
it
should
cool
she
broke
out
laughing
after
all
it
would
have
been
very
tough
she
admitted
then
why
in
the
sacred
name
of
shoe
leather
were
you
going
to
eat
it
asked
paragot
food
is
to
be
eaten
not
thrown
away
master
she
replied
sententiously
we
took
the
omnibus
and
crossed
the
river
and
went
up
the
grands
boulevards
an
unusual
excursion
for
paragot
who
kept
obstinately
to
the
boulevard
and
the
poorer
streets
of
the
through
fear
i
believe
of
meeting
friends
of
former
days
a
restaurant
outside
the
porte
provided
a
succulent
meal
the
place
was
crowded
two
young
soldiers
sat
at
our
table
and
listened
to
paragot
conversation
and
were
prodigiously
polite
to
blanquette
who
they
discovered
was
from
normandy
like
themselves
and
when
they
asked
after
the
frank
manner
of
their
kind
which
of
us
had
the
honour
to
be
the
lover
of
mademoiselle
and
she
cried
with
scarlet
face
but
neither
monsieur
we
all
shouted
together
and
laughed
and
became
the
best
friends
in
the
world
happy
country
of
fraternity
the
little
soldiers
they
were
dragoons
and
wore
helmets
too
big
for
them
and
long
horsehair
plumes
accompanied
us
with
clanking
sabres
to
the
gallery
of
the
theatre
and
at
paragot
invitation
sat
one
on
each
side
of
blanquette
who
what
with
the
unaccustomed
bloodshed
of
the
spectacle
and
the
gallantry
of
her
neighbours
passed
an
evening
of
delirious
happiness
in
those
days
i
had
an
æsthetic
soul
above
the
de
paris
and
i
made
fun
of
it
to
paragot
whose
thoughts
were
far
away
when
i
perceived
this
i
kept
my
withering
sarcasm
to
myself
and
realised
that
a
flattened
man
can
not
be
blown
like
a
bladder
into
permanent
rotundity
even
by
the
faith
and
affection
of
a
little
but
i
marvelled
all
the
more
at
his
gaiety
during
the
intervals
when
we
all
went
outside
into
the
thronged
boulevard
and
drank
bocks
on
the
terrace
of
the
café
and
i
learned
how
great
a
factor
in
the
continued
existence
of
humanity
is
the
which
i
think
the
german
philosopher
has
omitted
from
his
system
i
mention
this
incident
to
show
how
paragot
defied
the
effects
of
the
steam
roller
and
became
outwardly
himself
again
he
did
not
visit
the
café
delphine
that
night
but
went
soberly
home
with
blanquette
and
i
believe
read
himself
to
sleep
with
his
tattered
odd
volume
of
montesquieu
the
following
evening
however
found
him
in
his
usual
seat
under
the
lee
of
madame
boin
counter
arguing
on
art
literature
and
philosophy
and
consuming
a
vast
quantity
of
alcohols
and
then
his
life
resumed
its
normal
course
it
was
about
this
time
that
madame
boin
seeing
in
paragot
an
attractive
adjunct
to
her
establishment
and
with
a
frenchwoman
business
instinct
desiring
to
make
it
permanent
paralysed
him
by
an
offer
of
marriage
madame
said
he
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
if
i
accepted
the
great
honour
which
you
propose
you
would
doubtless
require
me
to
abandon
certain
personal
habits
which
are
dear
to
me
and
also
to
trim
my
hair
and
beard
and
cut
my
of
whose
fantastic
length
i
am
inordinately
proud
i
think
i
should
ask
you
to
cut
your
nails
said
madame
boin
reflectively
then
madame
said
paragot
it
would
be
impossible
shorn
of
these
adornments
i
should
lose
the
power
of
conversation
and
i
should
be
a
helpless
and
useless
samson
on
your
hands
i
do
see
what
long
nails
have
to
do
with
talking
argued
madame
boin
they
give
one
the
necessary
thirst
replied
paragot
my
son
said
he
when
relating
to
me
this
adventure
do
not
cultivate
a
habit
of
affability
towards
widows
of
the
lower
middle
classes
there
was
once
a
murderer
widow
of
prague
i
know
said
i
how
there
was
an
old
stocking
i
forgot
said
he
and
his
laughing
face
darkened
and
i
saw
that
he
fell
to
thinking
of
joanna
although
much
of
my
leisure
was
absorbed
by
the
companionship
of
my
beloved
master
and
blanquette
i
yet
had
an
individual
life
of
my
own
i
made
dozens
of
acquaintances
and
one
or
two
friends
i
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
bisard
the
great
man
attached
to
the
life
school
in
atelier
proclaimed
me
one
of
the
best
of
my
year
and
sent
my
heart
leaping
i
worked
early
and
late
i
also
played
the
fool
as
worse
luck
only
boyhood
can
with
my
fellows
arm
in
arm
through
the
streets
i
shouted
imbecile
songs
i
went
to
all
kinds
of
reprehensible
places
to
the
du
for
instance
where
we
danced
with
damsels
who
thought
a
generous
supper
and
a
bottle
of
as
setting
the
seal
of
all
that
was
most
distinguished
upon
the
host
with
the
first
five
francs
that
i
made
by
selling
a
drawing
i
treated
fanchette
the
little
model
i
kissed
on
the
stairs
to
a
trip
to
five
francs
went
prodigiously
far
in
those
days
they
had
to
as
some
of
us
were
desperately
poor
and
could
afford
but
one
meal
a
day
fortunate
youth
that
i
was
whenever
money
ran
short
instead
of
borrowing
or
starving
i
had
only
to
climb
to
blanquette
and
open
my
mouth
like
a
young
bird
and
she
filled
it
with
nice
fat
things
poor
sandalled
cazalet
of
the
yellow
hair
on
the
other
hand
lived
sometimes
for
a
week
on
dry
bread
and
water
it
was
partly
his
own
fault
for
had
he
chosen
to
make
saleable
drawings
he
too
might
have
had
five
francs
wherewith
to
take
fanchette
to
pretty
little
pierrettes
in
frills
and
pointed
caps
are
more
attractive
to
the
cheap
purchaser
than
ugly
souls
writhing
in
torment
and
really
they
are
quite
as
artistic
we
quarrelled
fiercely
over
this
one
day
and
he
challenged
me
to
a
duel
i
replied
that
i
had
no
money
to
buy
pistols
neither
had
he
he
retorted
but
i
could
borrow
a
sabre
he
himself
had
one
his
father
had
been
an
officer
whereupon
the
studio
bawled
in
gleeful
unison
le
sabre
le
sabre
de
mon
and
dragged
us
in
tumult
to
the
café
opposite
where
we
swore
eternal
friendship
over
from
this
i
do
not
mean
you
to
infer
that
i
was
a
devil
of
a
fellow
the
mention
of
whose
name
spread
a
hush
over
godly
families
god
wot
i
did
little
harm
i
only
ate
what
murger
calls
the
blessed
bread
of
gaiety
the
food
of
youth
remember
too
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
had
companions
of
my
own
age
indeed
so
nearly
had
i
modelled
myself
on
paragot
the
ever
young
that
my
comrades
laughed
at
my
old
fashioned
ideas
and
i
found
myself
hopelessly
behind
the
times
youth
hops
an
inch
sideways
and
thinks
it
has
leaped
a
mile
ahead
all
is
vanity
even
youth
is
a
pleasant
vanity
though
on
which
the
wise
smile
with
regretful
indulgence
and
therein
lay
the
wisdom
of
paragot
ah
confounded
little
i
have
seen
you
for
a
week
he
said
one
morning
shaking
me
by
the
shoulders
till
my
teeth
chattered
what
about
the
other
little
sparrow
you
neglected
me
for
on
sunday
is
she
at
least
a
model
and
she
is
a
good
girl
and
supports
her
widowed
mother
and
ten
brothers
and
sisters
i
suppose
and
she
calls
herself
fanchette
narcisse
the
lady
of
monsieur
affections
has
the
singular
name
of
fanchette
whereupon
narcisse
uncurled
himself
from
slumber
and
planted
himself
on
his
hindquarters
in
front
of
me
and
grinned
at
me
with
lolling
tongue
but
she
is
quite
a
different
kind
of
girl
from
all
the
other
models
i
cried
eagerly
what
does
she
pose
for
well
of
course
you
know
how
it
is
i
stammered
reddening
paragot
laughed
and
quoted
something
in
latin
about
an
ingenuous
boy
would
she
be
a
fit
companion
for
blanquette
and
narcisse
and
myself
having
deep
convictions
as
to
the
essential
virtues
of
fanchette
i
swore
that
she
could
not
disgrace
so
respectable
a
company
we
will
all
picnic
together
in
the
woods
of
fontainebleau
on
sunday
said
he
we
fanchette
had
no
shynesses
she
found
paragot
peculiarly
diverting
and
though
i
enjoyed
the
day
prodigiously
i
realised
afterwards
that
i
had
spent
most
of
it
in
the
company
of
blanquette
my
son
said
he
there
never
was
a
model
so
like
all
the
other
models
that
have
posed
for
the
since
the
world
began
a
week
later
when
i
found
my
particular
friend
ewing
whom
as
a
englishman
i
had
relieved
of
many
embarrassments
and
for
whom
i
had
secured
an
easel
branding
it
myself
in
twenty
places
with
his
name
and
for
whom
i
had
engineered
a
good
position
next
to
mine
in
the
life
school
when
i
saw
ewing
hugging
fanchette
on
the
stairs
on
the
very
landing
sacred
to
my
embraces
i
knew
that
paragot
was
right
and
that
fanchette
was
just
a
fickle
naughty
little
model
like
the
others
but
if
paragot
had
not
taken
her
measure
before
my
eyes
at
fontainebleau
and
made
a
figured
drawing
so
to
speak
of
her
heart
and
soul
shewing
their
exiguous
dimensions
i
might
have
cast
myself
beneath
the
wheels
of
an
omnibus
like
the
pig
népomucène
or
blacked
the
eyes
of
ewing
who
was
smaller
than
myself
as
it
was
i
put
my
hands
in
my
trousers
pockets
and
surveyed
the
abashed
couple
in
paragot
best
manner
amuse
yourselves
well
my
children
i
laughed
in
french
and
turned
away
this
is
an
instance
of
the
wisdom
of
paragot
he
smiled
on
the
vanity
of
my
youth
and
personally
conducted
me
to
the
barrenness
whither
it
led
in
this
particular
case
the
result
was
more
positive
still
ewing
in
admiration
of
my
magnanimity
at
the
time
and
a
fortnight
later
of
my
profound
knowledge
of
women
for
he
in
his
turn
witnessed
the
alien
osculations
of
fanchette
cultivated
my
friendship
to
the
extent
of
urging
me
to
spend
some
of
the
summer
recess
at
his
father
country
vicarage
in
somerset
but
you
have
to
get
some
other
togs
said
he
eyeing
my
attire
dubiously
if
you
come
like
that
to
church
on
sunday
my
governor
would
forget
and
want
to
baptise
you
he
was
once
a
missionary
you
know
when
i
mentioned
the
invitation
paragot
insisted
on
acceptance
the
latin
quarter
confers
an
exuberance
of
tone
which
conflicts
with
the
reposeful
ideal
of
manners
required
in
the
which
i
destined
you
to
grace
when
i
took
you
from
the
maternal
soapsuds
you
will
find
an
english
parsonage
exerts
a
repressive
influence
but
for
heaven
sake
do
fall
in
love
with
ewing
eldest
sister
who
i
am
sure
is
addicted
to
piety
and
good
works
she
will
try
to
make
a
good
work
of
you
and
thus
all
my
labour
will
have
been
in
vain
in
his
heart
however
i
believe
he
was
immensely
proud
at
having
trained
me
to
meet
gentlefolk
on
more
or
less
equal
terms
invitation
was
a
tribute
to
himself
to
fit
me
for
church
on
sunday
and
other
functions
of
civilisation
he
took
ewing
as
counsellor
and
myself
to
a
tailor
and
plunged
enthusiastically
into
the
details
of
my
outfit
i
can
see
him
now
shaggy
and
shabby
fingering
stuffs
with
the
anxious
solicitude
of
a
woman
at
a
draper
counter
that
a
nice
country
suiting
it
expresses
its
purpose
suggests
the
right
gaiety
of
mood
what
says
do
you
think
it
might
make
the
shy
says
ewing
and
paragot
drops
reluctantly
the
check
that
has
seized
his
unaccustomed
fancy
my
wardrobe
included
a
dress
suit
at
paragot
bidding
i
donned
it
when
it
arrived
and
on
my
way
to
him
transfixed
the
rue
des
saladiers
with
awe
and
wonder
upstairs
paragot
twirled
me
slowly
round
as
if
i
were
a
mannequin
on
a
pivot
and
called
blanquette
to
admire
and
uttered
strange
oaths
in
the
dozen
languages
of
which
he
was
master
was
i
not
beautiful
blanquette
admitted
that
i
was
all
that
was
most
beautiful
without
a
doubt
i
resembled
the
stylish
people
who
went
to
expensive
funerals
in
fact
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
was
too
beautiful
she
saw
her
brother
asticot
transfigured
into
the
resplendent
gentleman
beyond
her
sphere
and
sighed
womanlike
at
my
apotheosis
she
could
no
longer
walk
by
my
side
bareheaded
in
the
streets
the
dress
suit
was
a
symbol
of
change
detested
by
woman
she
gave
the
matter
however
her
practical
attention
he
ought
to
have
shoes
she
observed
that
true
said
paragot
pulling
his
beard
reflectively
ewing
should
have
mentioned
it
but
i
have
noticed
a
singular
lack
of
universality
in
the
sons
of
english
clergymen
and
now
my
son
said
he
on
the
eve
of
my
departure
i
too
have
the
nostalgia
of
green
fields
and
the
smell
of
hay
and
manure
and
the
fresh
earth
after
rain
i
have
at
last
an
inspiration
as
this
confounded
ankle
will
not
let
me
walk
i
shall
hire
a
donkey
and
let
him
take
me
whither
he
will
narcisse
shall
accompany
me
and
blanquette
will
she
trudge
beside
the
donkey
i
have
arranged
for
blanquette
to
go
into
villégiatura
at
the
farm
of
la
haye
with
monsieur
and
madame
dubosc
your
logical
faculty
does
you
credit
my
son
they
are
most
excellent
people
although
they
could
not
tell
me
how
many
towers
the
cathedral
of
chartres
possessed
you
will
remember
an
excursion
we
made
on
sunday
and
i
lectured
learnedly
on
the
archæology
of
the
fabric
my
learning
impressed
them
less
than
my
skill
in
curing
a
pig
according
to
a
dalmatian
recipe
they
will
board
and
lodge
blanquette
for
ten
francs
a
week
and
she
will
be
as
happy
as
marie
antoinette
while
haymaking
at
the
petit
trianon
she
will
occupy
herself
with
geese
and
turkeys
while
i
shall
be
riding
my
donkey
master
said
i
i
only
have
one
fear
you
will
adopt
that
donkey
and
bring
it
to
live
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
paragot
laughed
drained
his
glass
of
absinthe
and
ordered
another
chapter
xv
thus
the
three
of
us
were
again
separated
blanquette
was
enjoying
herself
amongst
the
pigs
and
ducks
of
la
haye
whence
she
wrote
letters
in
which
her
joy
in
country
things
mingled
with
anxiety
as
to
the
neglected
condition
of
the
master
i
led
a
pleasant
but
somewhat
nervous
life
in
somersetshire
spending
hours
in
vain
attempts
to
reconcile
the
cosmic
views
of
paragot
and
an
english
vicar
and
learning
sometimes
with
hot
humiliation
the
correctitudes
of
english
country
vicarage
behaviour
and
paragot
his
long
legs
dangling
on
each
side
of
his
donkey
rode
as
i
thought
picturesquely
vagrant
through
the
leafy
byways
of
france
a
fortnight
after
my
arrival
however
he
informed
me
by
letter
of
his
resolve
to
stay
in
paris
he
had
failed
to
find
an
ass
of
the
true
vagabond
character
the
ideal
ass
he
sought
should
be
a
companion
as
well
as
a
means
of
locomotion
he
would
not
take
an
urban
donkey
into
the
country
against
its
will
to
force
any
creature
man
woman
or
ass
out
of
the
groove
of
its
temperament
were
a
crime
of
which
he
could
not
be
guilty
then
again
narcisse
did
not
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
pilgrimage
he
laid
his
head
along
his
forepaws
and
glowered
sullenly
instead
of
barking
with
enthusiasm
again
when
he
announced
his
intention
of
leaving
paris
hercule
groaned
aloud
and
madame
boin
wept
so
profusely
that
sitting
beneath
her
counter
he
had
to
put
up
a
borrowed
umbrella
cazalet
too
and
a
few
others
too
poor
for
railway
fares
were
staying
in
town
also
the
café
delphine
had
spoiled
him
for
the
horrible
alcohols
of
wayside
cafés
and
lastly
what
did
it
matter
where
the
body
found
itself
so
long
as
the
soul
had
its
serene
habitations
the
letter
depressed
me
i
was
beginning
to
see
paragot
with
the
eyes
of
a
man
i
felt
that
this
inability
to
carry
out
an
inspiration
was
a
sign
of
decay
the
springs
of
action
had
weakened
though
the
spirit
thirsted
for
sweet
things
habit
chained
him
to
the
squalor
of
the
café
delphine
when
the
quiet
somersetshire
household
knelt
around
the
for
evening
prayers
i
speculated
on
the
stage
of
intoxication
at
which
my
lonely
master
had
arrived
i
was
a
million
miles
from
speculating
on
what
was
really
happening
and
when
i
received
a
curt
uncharacteristic
note
from
paragot
a
fortnight
later
begging
me
to
return
to
paris
at
once
a
day
or
two
before
the
formal
expiry
of
my
visit
it
only
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
be
the
crowded
train
steamed
into
the
gare
at
half
past
seven
in
the
morning
i
was
desperately
anxious
to
get
to
paragot
and
bag
in
hand
i
stood
with
a
sickening
feeling
of
suspense
by
the
open
door
waiting
for
the
train
to
slow
down
i
sprang
out
in
an
instant
the
line
of
porters
were
odd
dots
of
blue
in
the
throng
that
swarmed
out
of
the
carriages
i
became
a
mere
ant
in
the
heap
and
struggled
with
the
others
towards
the
barrier
after
giving
up
my
ticket
i
set
down
my
bag
to
rest
my
strained
arm
for
a
minute
and
looked
around
me
then
i
noticed
a
stranger
approaching
whose
smiling
face
had
an
air
of
uncanny
familiarity
where
had
i
seen
the
long
gaunt
man
before
he
wore
a
silk
hat
and
a
frock
coat
my
acquaintance
with
gentlemen
in
paris
was
limited
i
picked
up
my
bag
ah
my
little
asticot
cried
the
stranger
how
good
it
is
to
see
you
i
dropped
my
bag
i
dropped
my
jaw
i
would
have
dropped
my
brains
had
they
been
loose
this
cadaverous
image
of
respectability
was
paragot
but
a
paragot
transmogrified
beyond
recognition
even
by
me
his
hair
was
cropped
short
his
face
was
clean
shaven
on
his
transfigured
head
shone
a
flat
brimmed
silk
hat
he
wore
a
villainously
fitting
frock
coat
buttoned
across
his
chest
with
long
wrinkly
creases
stretching
horizontally
from
each
button
his
hands
were
encased
in
lemon
coloured
gloves
a
size
too
large
for
him
when
he
extended
his
hand
even
my
bewilderment
did
not
blind
me
to
the
of
flat
dead
tips
to
the
fingers
beneath
his
arm
was
an
umbrella
on
a
broiling
august
morning
he
wore
spats
in
his
trousers
were
fawn
coloured
i
could
only
gape
at
him
as
he
wrung
me
by
the
hand
you
are
surprised
my
son
i
did
not
expect
you
to
meet
my
train
master
said
i
if
one
could
anticipate
all
the
happenings
of
life
it
would
lose
its
fascination
my
son
go
your
way
and
do
your
duty
but
believe
in
the
unexpected
but
what
has
happened
i
asked
again
surveying
his
glory
the
comte
de
verneuil
is
dead
he
answered
are
you
going
to
his
funeral
in
these
he
cried
holding
up
the
lemon
kids
and
this
cravat
i
noticed
that
he
wore
a
floppy
purple
tie
adorned
with
yellow
spots
outside
the
lapels
of
his
coat
it
required
more
than
two
glances
to
take
in
all
his
detail
besides
he
added
my
distinguished
patient
was
buried
a
fortnight
ago
he
looked
at
me
with
an
amused
smile
enjoying
my
mystification
like
a
child
you
did
know
me
no
master
i
rubbed
my
eyes
in
fact
i
scarcely
recognise
you
now
that
is
because
i
am
again
gaston
de
nérac
said
he
magnificently
i
had
an
idea
that
he
must
have
come
into
the
family
fortune
but
what
had
the
death
of
the
comte
de
verneuil
to
do
with
it
i
picked
up
my
bag
again
and
walked
with
him
to
the
exit
the
hurrying
crowd
of
passengers
by
my
train
and
of
clerks
and
pouring
from
suburban
platforms
rendered
conversation
impossible
at
the
station
gates
paragot
stood
and
watched
the
brisk
life
that
swarmed
up
and
down
the
rue
and
the
rue
du
havre
paris
awakens
a
couple
of
hours
earlier
than
london
clerks
hurried
by
with
flat
leather
portfolios
under
their
arms
servants
trotted
to
market
or
homewards
with
the
end
of
a
long
golden
loaf
protruding
from
their
baskets
sped
by
in
all
directions
omnibuses
lumbered
along
as
at
midday
before
the
great
cafés
opposite
the
tables
were
already
set
out
on
the
terrace
and
the
awnings
lowered
and
waiters
stood
expectant
the
whole
scene
was
bathed
in
the
gay
morning
sunshine
it
is
good
to
be
alive
asticot
said
my
master
it
is
good
to
be
in
paris
it
is
good
to
get
up
early
it
is
good
to
see
the
world
work
beginning
it
is
also
good
to
feel
infernally
hungry
and
to
have
the
means
of
satisfying
one
desires
but
as
in
the
absence
of
blanquette
my
establishment
is
disorganised
i
think
we
had
better
have
our
breakfast
at
a
than
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
we
can
talk
over
our
coffee
i
accompanied
him
across
the
street
in
a
muddled
condition
of
intellect
casting
sidelong
glances
at
him
from
time
to
time
as
if
to
assure
myself
that
he
was
real
having
just
come
from
an
english
environment
where
the
niceties
of
costume
were
as
rigidly
observed
as
the
niceties
of
religion
i
could
not
help
marvelling
at
paragot
attire
he
looked
like
a
french
provincial
actor
made
up
to
represent
a
duke
and
in
a
country
where
none
but
actors
and
footmen
are
this
likeness
was
the
more
accentuated
also
the
difference
between
paragot
hairy
and
bearded
and
paragot
in
his
present
callow
state
was
that
between
an
old
unbroken
hazel
nut
and
its
bald
shrivelled
kernel
we
entered
the
sat
down
and
ordered
our
coffee
and
crisp
loaves
i
think
the
at
a
is
one
of
the
most
daintily
served
meals
in
france
the
morning
dew
glistens
so
freshly
on
the
butter
the
fringed
napkin
is
so
spotless
the
cups
offer
themselves
so
delicately
generous
if
everyone
breakfasted
there
crime
would
cease
no
man
could
hatch
a
day
iniquity
amid
such
influences
when
we
were
through
paragot
unbuttoned
his
frock
coat
and
took
from
his
pocket
a
letter
which
he
flourished
before
my
eyes
it
was
then
that
i
noticed
to
my
great
surprise
that
he
had
cut
his
i
thought
of
madame
boin
it
is
from
the
comtesse
de
verneuil
and
it
gives
you
the
word
of
the
enigma
yes
master
said
i
eyeing
the
letter
confess
my
little
asticot
he
laughed
that
you
are
dying
of
curiosity
you
would
tell
me
said
i
that
it
was
no
death
for
a
gentleman
you
have
a
way
of
repeating
my
unsaid
epigrams
which
delights
me
said
he
throwing
the
letter
on
the
table
read
it
i
read
as
follows
château
marlier
près
de
nevers
my
dear
gaston
the
newspapers
may
have
told
you
the
news
of
my
husband
death
on
the
august
since
then
i
have
been
longing
to
write
to
you
but
i
have
not
found
the
strength
yet
i
must
forgive
me
for
the
cruel
things
i
said
on
the
last
unhappy
night
we
met
i
did
not
know
what
i
do
now
before
my
husband
died
he
told
me
the
true
circumstances
of
the
money
transaction
my
husband
bought
me
it
is
true
gaston
but
you
did
not
sell
me
you
sacrificed
all
to
save
my
father
from
prison
and
me
from
disgrace
you
have
lived
through
everything
a
brave
loyal
gentleman
and
even
on
that
hateful
night
you
kept
silent
but
oh
my
friend
what
misery
it
has
been
to
all
of
us
i
shall
be
in
paris
on
the
hôtel
meurice
if
you
care
to
see
me
will
you
make
an
appointment
i
would
meet
you
at
any
place
you
might
suggest
the
flat
in
the
avenue
de
messine
is
dismantled
and
besides
i
shrink
from
going
back
there
yours
sincerely
joanna
de
verneuil
you
see
my
son
what
she
calls
me
a
brave
loyal
gentleman
he
cried
with
his
pathetic
boastfulness
thank
heaven
she
knows
it
i
have
kept
the
secret
deep
in
my
heart
all
these
years
one
must
be
a
man
to
do
that
eh
he
thumped
his
heart
and
drank
a
draught
of
coffee
then
he
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
he
eyed
the
brown
stain
disgustedly
that
said
he
is
paragot
peeping
out
through
gaston
de
nérac
you
will
have
observed
that
in
the
polite
world
they
use
the
comtesse
de
verneuil
said
i
bringing
back
the
conversation
to
more
interesting
matters
writes
that
she
will
be
in
paris
on
the
it
was
the
yesterday
i
am
aware
of
it
i
have
been
aware
of
it
for
a
fortnight
yesterday
i
had
a
long
interview
with
madame
la
comtesse
it
was
very
satisfactory
i
pay
her
a
ceremonious
visit
at
eleven
at
twelve
i
hope
you
will
also
pay
your
respects
and
offer
your
condolences
to
madame
you
ought
to
have
a
silk
hat
but
master
i
laughed
if
i
went
down
the
boul
mich
in
a
silk
hat
i
should
be
taken
up
for
improper
behaviour
you
at
least
have
gloves
yes
master
remember
that
in
this
country
you
wear
both
gloves
while
paying
a
call
you
also
balance
your
hat
on
your
knees
but
madame
de
verneuil
is
english
i
remarked
she
has
learned
correct
behaviour
in
france
he
replied
with
the
solemnity
of
a
professor
of
deportment
you
will
have
noticed
in
her
letter
he
continued
how
delicately
she
implies
that
the
hôtel
meurice
would
not
be
a
suitable
rendezvous
in
my
late
incarnation
i
doubtless
should
have
surprised
the
hôtel
meurice
i
should
have
pained
the
head
porter
in
my
live
character
of
gaston
de
nérac
i
command
the
respect
of
flunkeydom
i
give
my
card
he
produced
from
his
pocket
and
flourished
in
the
air
an
ornate
heavily
printed
of
somewhat
the
size
and
appearance
of
the
three
of
spades
i
felt
greatly
awed
by
the
sight
of
this
final
emblem
of
respectability
i
give
my
card
he
repeated
and
the
hôtel
meurice
prostrates
itself
before
me
while
paragot
was
playing
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
conjuncture
my
mind
danced
in
wonder
and
delight
i
read
the
letter
which
he
left
in
my
hands
several
times
over
he
was
cleared
in
joanna
eyes
nay
more
he
stood
revealed
a
hero
the
generous
ardour
of
youth
bedewed
my
eyelids
master
i
cried
this
must
be
wonderful
news
for
you
he
nodded
over
his
coffee
cup
you
are
right
my
little
asticot
it
is
he
answered
gravely
when
i
called
at
the
hôtel
meurice
at
noon
i
was
conducted
with
embarrassing
ceremony
to
madame
de
verneuil
private
and
on
my
way
i
rehearsed
in
some
trepidation
the
polite
formula
of
condolence
which
paragot
had
taught
me
when
i
entered
the
sight
of
joanna
face
drove
polite
formulæ
out
of
my
head
she
was
dressed
in
black
it
is
true
but
the
black
only
set
off
the
shell
pink
of
her
cheeks
and
the
blue
of
her
eyes
which
were
no
longer
frozen
but
laughed
at
me
as
if
a
visit
of
condolence
were
the
gayest
event
possible
it
is
so
good
of
you
asticot
to
come
and
see
me
de
nérac
tells
me
you
have
travelled
straight
from
somerset
in
order
to
do
it
how
is
the
west
country
looking
i
am
of
the
west
country
myself
one
of
these
days
you
will
let
me
shew
it
you
i
like
him
much
better
gaston
dressed
like
an
englishman
instead
of
in
that
dreadful
student
which
makes
him
look
like
a
brigand
yes
england
has
agreed
with
him
oh
do
take
off
your
gloves
and
put
your
hat
down
i
am
not
a
french
mamma
with
a
daughter
whose
hand
you
are
asking
gaston
i
am
sure
you
told
him
to
keep
on
his
gloves
i
am
responsible
for
his
decorum
joanna
said
my
master
solemnly
i
noticed
that
he
too
had
discarded
hat
gloves
and
umbrella
which
lay
forlorn
on
a
distant
table
still
his
coat
was
buttoned
and
he
sat
bolt
upright
on
his
chair
madame
de
verneuil
silvery
voice
rippled
on
she
was
girlishly
excited
i
have
persuaded
de
nérac
to
lunch
with
me
she
said
happily
and
you
must
do
the
same
will
you
ring
the
bell
we
have
it
up
here
and
now
tell
me
about
somerset
never
was
there
a
sweeter
lady
than
mine
yes
i
call
her
mine
and
with
reason
was
she
not
the
first
vision
of
gracious
womanhood
that
came
into
my
childhood
world
up
to
then
woman
to
me
was
my
mother
and
housekeeper
joanna
sprang
magically
as
in
an
arabian
night
out
of
an
old
stocking
never
was
there
a
sweeter
lady
than
mine
she
welcomed
me
as
if
such
things
as
tambourines
café
delphines
and
absinthiated
paragots
had
never
existed
and
i
were
one
of
her
own
people
how
i
long
to
get
back
she
cried
when
i
had
told
her
of
my
modest
exploits
at
the
ewings
i
have
not
been
to
melford
for
five
years
when
will
you
come
gaston
they
had
evidently
made
good
use
of
their
previous
interviews
i
am
going
to
live
in
england
she
explained
at
first
i
shall
stay
with
my
mother
at
melford
she
is
an
old
friend
of
de
nérac
oh
gaston
she
does
so
want
to
see
you
i
have
told
her
the
whole
story
of
course
she
knew
all
my
poor
father
affairs
and
i
have
a
cousin
whose
people
live
at
melford
too
major
walters
i
do
think
you
know
him
a
dear
fellow
he
has
just
been
at
nevers
helping
me
to
settle
up
things
he
is
my
trustee
you
must
be
great
friends
i
remember
the
name
said
paragot
why
of
course
you
ought
to
she
cried
prettily
with
a
laugh
and
a
blush
i
had
forgotten
you
were
pleased
to
be
jealous
of
him
asticot
you
will
have
to
forgive
us
for
dragging
memories
out
of
the
dust
heap
it
is
all
so
very
long
ago
dear
me
her
face
grew
pathetic
it
is
very
long
ago
gaston
thirteen
years
said
he
i
calculated
joanna
was
a
woman
about
to
be
married
when
my
age
was
six
i
suddenly
felt
very
young
indeed
the
waiters
set
the
lunch
joanna
most
perfect
of
hostesses
presided
gaily
cracked
little
jokes
for
my
entertainment
and
inspired
me
with
the
power
of
quite
elegant
conversation
paragot
preserved
his
correct
demeanour
and
to
my
puzzledom
spoke
very
little
i
wondered
whether
the
repressive
influence
lay
in
the
spats
or
the
purple
cravat
with
the
yellow
spots
as
a
painter
i
did
like
the
cravat
he
drank
a
great
deal
of
water
with
his
wine
i
noticed
him
once
pause
in
the
act
of
conveying
to
his
mouth
a
bit
of
bread
held
in
his
fingers
with
which
he
had
mopped
up
the
sauce
in
his
plate
and
furtively
conceal
it
between
his
cutlet
bones
a
manoeuvre
which
at
the
time
i
could
not
understand
in
the
we
cleaned
our
plates
to
a
bright
polish
with
bits
of
bread
how
else
could
you
consume
the
sauce
at
the
end
of
the
meal
joanna
gave
us
permission
to
smoke
i
wo
smoke
thank
you
said
paragot
politely
rubbish
laughed
joanna
whereupon
paragot
produced
a
cigarette
case
from
the
breast
pocket
of
his
frock
coat
paragot
and
a
once
more
it
was
he
also
refused
cognac
with
his
coffee
after
a
time
still
feeling
that
i
was
very
young
and
that
my
seniors
might
have
further
confidential
things
to
say
to
each
other
i
rose
to
take
my
leave
paragot
rose
too
i
would
ask
you
to
stay
gaston
if
i
had
my
wretched
lawyer
to
see
this
afternoon
but
you
come
in
for
an
hour
after
dinner
wo
you
no
one
knows
i
in
paris
besides
at
this
time
of
year
there
is
no
one
in
paris
to
know
willingly
said
paragot
but
joanna
pretty
lips
parted
in
astonishment
you
preaching
the
proprieties
my
dear
gaston
i
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
at
the
tuileries
gardens
which
baked
in
the
afternoon
sun
the
two
spoke
a
little
in
low
voices
but
i
could
not
help
overhearing
is
it
true
gaston
that
you
have
wanted
me
all
these
years
i
want
you
as
much
now
as
i
did
then
i
too
whispered
joanna
chapter
xvi
as
we
emerged
from
the
hôtel
meurice
i
turned
instinctively
to
the
left
paragot
drew
me
to
the
right
henceforward
said
he
i
resume
the
paris
which
is
my
birthright
we
will
forget
for
a
moment
that
there
are
such
places
as
the
boulevard
and
the
rue
des
saladiers
we
walked
along
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
taking
the
rue
royale
passed
the
madeleine
and
arrived
at
the
café
de
la
paix
it
was
a
broiling
afternoon
the
cool
terrace
of
the
café
invited
the
hot
wayfarer
to
repose
master
said
i
is
it
almost
time
for
your
absinthe
he
raised
his
lemon
kids
as
if
he
would
ban
the
place
my
little
asticot
i
have
abjured
absinthe
and
forsworn
cafés
i
have
broken
my
new
porcelain
pipe
and
have
cut
my
as
i
enter
on
the
path
of
happiness
i
scatter
the
dregs
and
shreds
and
clippings
of
the
past
behind
me
i
divest
myself
of
all
the
crapulous
years
if
he
had
divested
himself
of
the
superfluous
trappings
of
respectability
beneath
which
he
was
perspiring
freely
i
thought
he
would
have
been
happier
the
sight
of
the
umbrella
alone
made
one
feel
moist
to
say
nothing
of
the
spats
we
might
have
some
grenadine
syrup
i
suggested
ironically
willingly
said
he
so
we
sat
and
drank
grenadine
syrup
and
water
he
gave
me
the
impression
of
a
cropped
lion
sucking
lollipops
it
is
peculiarly
nasty
and
unsatisfying
he
remarked
after
a
sip
but
doubtless
i
shall
get
used
to
it
i
shall
have
to
get
used
to
a
devil
of
a
lot
of
things
my
son
as
soon
as
the
period
of
her
widowhood
has
elapsed
i
hope
to
marry
madame
de
verneuil
marry
madame
de
verneuil
i
cried
the
possibility
of
such
an
occurrence
never
having
crossed
my
mind
why
not
when
two
people
of
equal
rank
love
and
are
free
to
marry
why
should
they
not
do
so
have
you
any
objection
no
master
said
i
i
shall
resume
my
profession
he
announced
lighting
a
cigarette
and
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
regain
the
position
to
which
an
ancient
de
is
entitled
i
was
destined
that
day
to
go
from
astonishment
to
astonishment
you
a
de
master
yes
my
son
in
architecture
he
was
clothed
in
a
new
and
sudden
radiance
to
a
paris
art
student
a
de
is
what
a
field
marshal
is
to
a
private
soldier
a
lord
chancellor
to
the
eater
of
dinners
in
the
temple
i
must
confess
that
though
my
passionate
affection
for
him
never
wavered
yet
my
childish
reverence
had
of
late
waned
in
intensity
i
saw
his
faults
which
is
incompatible
with
true
but
now
he
sprang
to
cloud
summits
of
veneration
i
looked
at
him
and
beheld
nothing
but
an
ancient
de
then
i
remembered
our
enthusiasm
over
the
palace
of
dipsomania
they
said
you
were
an
architect
that
night
at
the
café
delphine
i
exclaimed
i
was
a
genius
said
paragot
modestly
i
used
to
think
in
palaces
most
men
palaces
are
little
buildings
written
big
my
small
buildings
were
palaces
reduced
i
could
have
roofed
in
the
whole
of
paris
with
a
dome
my
first
commission
was
to
put
a
new
roof
on
a
baptist
chapel
in
ireland
it
was
then
that
i
met
madame
de
verneuil
after
an
interval
of
five
years
we
are
second
cousins
her
father
and
my
mother
were
first
cousins
i
have
known
her
since
she
was
born
when
i
was
at
rugby
i
spent
most
of
my
holidays
at
her
house
you
must
take
all
this
into
account
my
little
asticot
before
you
begin
to
criticise
my
plans
for
the
future
by
this
time
the
nerve
or
brain
cell
whereby
one
experiences
the
sensation
of
amazement
was
numb
if
paragot
had
informed
me
that
he
had
been
a
boon
companion
of
king
qa
and
had
built
the
pyramids
of
egypt
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
i
could
only
record
the
various
facts
paragot
was
at
rugby
paragot
was
joanna
second
cousin
paragot
was
a
de
paragot
was
a
genius
who
had
put
a
new
roof
to
a
baptist
chapel
in
ireland
paragot
was
going
to
marry
joanna
how
he
proposed
to
start
in
practice
at
his
age
with
no
connection
i
did
not
at
the
moment
enquire
neither
did
paragot
it
was
easy
way
to
leap
to
ends
and
let
the
means
take
care
of
themselves
he
drained
his
glass
meditatively
and
then
with
a
wry
face
spat
on
the
ground
if
i
do
have
a
cognac
my
little
asticot
said
he
i
shall
be
sick
i
may
be
able
to
swallow
syrup
without
either
salivation
or
the
adventitious
aid
of
alcohol
he
summoned
the
languid
waiter
and
ordered
everything
seemed
languid
this
torrid
afternoon
except
the
british
or
american
tourists
who
passed
by
with
baedekers
under
their
arms
the
in
the
file
opposite
us
dropped
their
heads
and
the
cabmen
regarded
the
baking
place
de
with
more
than
their
usual
apathy
it
looked
more
like
the
market
place
of
a
sleepy
provincial
town
than
the
heart
of
paris
when
the
waiter
had
brought
the
little
glass
in
a
saucer
and
the
had
poured
out
the
brandy
paragot
gulped
it
down
and
cleared
his
throat
noisily
i
drowsed
in
my
chair
feeling
comfortably
tired
after
my
all
night
journey
suddenly
i
awakened
to
the
fact
that
paragot
was
telling
me
the
story
of
joanna
and
the
comte
de
verneuil
she
was
exquisite
she
was
fragrant
she
was
an
english
rosebud
wet
with
she
had
all
manner
of
attributes
with
which
i
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
they
loved
with
the
ardour
of
two
young
and
noble
souls
your
ordinary
englishman
would
not
thus
proclaim
the
nobility
of
his
soul
but
paragot
remember
was
half
french
and
gascon
to
boot
and
the
other
half
irish
it
was
more
than
love
it
was
a
consuming
passion
which
was
odd
in
the
case
of
an
english
rosebud
wet
with
however
i
suppose
paragot
meant
that
he
swept
the
beloved
maiden
off
her
feet
with
his
own
vehemence
and
indeed
she
must
have
loved
him
truly
he
was
fresh
from
the
villa
medici
the
paradise
where
all
the
winners
of
the
de
in
the
various
arts
complete
their
training
he
had
won
an
important
competition
fortune
smiled
on
him
he
had
only
to
rule
lines
on
drawing
paper
to
become
one
of
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
he
became
engaged
to
joanna
now
joanna
father
simon
rushworth
was
a
london
solicitor
in
very
fashionable
practice
a
man
of
false
geniality
said
paragot
who
smiled
at
you
with
lips
but
seemed
always
to
be
looking
at
some
hell
over
your
shoulder
he
also
promoted
companies
and
the
comte
de
verneuil
an
financier
stood
ever
by
his
elbow
using
him
as
his
tool
and
dupe
and
drawer
in
general
of
chestnuts
from
the
fire
the
comte
wanted
to
marry
joanna
which
was
absurd
seeing
that
i
was
his
rival
said
paragot
simply
one
of
rushworth
companies
failed
rushworth
fashionable
clients
grew
alarmed
he
gave
a
party
in
honour
of
joanna
engagement
and
invited
all
his
clients
ugly
rumours
spread
among
the
guests
the
presage
of
disaster
was
in
the
air
paragot
began
to
suspect
the
truth
it
was
a
hateful
party
the
band
in
the
garden
played
selections
from
orphée
aux
enfers
and
the
mocking
refrain
accompanied
the
last
words
he
was
to
have
with
joanna
the
comte
de
verneuil
called
him
aside
explained
rushworth
position
ten
thousand
pounds
of
his
money
which
he
held
in
trust
had
gone
in
the
failure
of
the
company
if
that
amount
was
not
at
his
disposal
the
next
morning
he
was
finished
snuffed
out
it
appeared
that
no
one
in
paris
or
london
would
lend
him
the
money
his
credit
being
gone
unless
de
nérac
could
find
the
ten
thousand
pounds
there
was
the
gaol
yawning
with
horrible
certainty
for
de
nérac
prospective
as
paragot
patrimony
invested
in
french
government
securities
was
not
a
third
of
this
sum
he
could
do
nothing
but
wring
his
hands
in
despair
and
call
on
providence
and
the
comte
de
verneuil
the
former
turned
a
deaf
ear
the
latter
declared
himself
a
man
of
business
and
not
a
philanthropist
he
was
ready
however
to
purchase
an
option
on
the
young
lady
affections
did
not
de
nérac
know
what
an
option
was
he
would
explain
he
drafted
the
famous
contract
in
return
for
paragot
signature
he
would
hand
him
a
cheque
drawn
in
favour
of
simon
rushworth
de
dieu
cried
paragot
banging
the
marble
table
with
his
fist
do
you
see
in
what
a
vice
he
held
me
he
was
a
devil
that
man
the
only
human
trait
about
him
was
a
passion
for
rare
apes
of
which
he
had
a
collection
at
nevers
thank
heaven
they
are
dead
thank
heaven
he
is
dead
thank
heaven
he
lost
most
of
the
money
for
which
he
preyed
on
his
kind
he
was
a
vulture
a
vulture
he
was
the
carrion
kite
above
every
rotten
financial
concern
in
london
and
paris
that
which
went
near
to
ruin
my
poor
vain
fool
of
a
filled
his
bulging
pockets
i
hated
him
living
and
i
hate
him
dead
he
tore
open
his
frock
coat
and
pushed
the
flat
brimmed
silk
hat
to
the
back
of
his
head
and
waved
his
lemon
kids
in
his
old
extravagant
gestures
what
did
the
stolen
ten
thousand
pounds
matter
to
him
it
mattered
prison
to
rushworth
joanna
father
think
of
the
horror
of
it
she
would
have
died
from
the
disgrace
her
mother
too
and
the
devil
jested
asticot
he
talked
of
rushworth
being
smitten
with
the
slings
and
black
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
de
i
could
have
strangled
him
but
what
could
i
do
two
years
to
go
out
of
her
life
for
two
years
as
if
i
had
been
struck
dead
yet
after
two
years
i
could
come
back
and
say
what
i
chose
i
signed
the
contract
i
went
out
of
the
house
i
kept
my
word
i
was
gaston
de
nérac
i
came
back
to
paris
i
worked
night
and
day
for
eighteen
months
i
had
genius
i
had
hope
i
had
youth
i
had
faith
she
would
never
marry
the
comte
de
verneuil
she
would
not
marry
anybody
i
counted
the
days
meanwhile
he
posed
as
the
saviour
of
simon
rushworth
he
poisoned
joanna
mind
against
me
he
lied
invented
infamies
this
i
have
heard
lately
he
confessed
it
all
to
her
before
the
devil
took
him
as
a
of
one
who
had
so
cruelly
treated
her
all
things
were
possible
she
half
believed
them
at
last
he
told
her
i
was
dead
an
acquaintance
had
found
me
in
a
paris
hospital
and
had
paid
for
my
funeral
she
had
no
reason
for
disbelief
he
pressed
his
suit
her
father
and
mother
urged
her
the
fool
rushworth
soon
afterwards
came
to
another
crisis
and
de
verneuil
again
stepped
in
and
demanded
joanna
as
the
price
she
is
gentle
she
has
a
heart
tenderer
than
that
of
any
woman
who
ever
lived
one
day
i
heard
she
had
married
him
my
god
it
is
thirteen
years
ago
he
poured
some
water
into
the
syrup
glass
and
gulped
it
down
i
remained
silent
i
had
never
seen
him
give
way
to
violent
emotion
save
once
when
he
broke
the
fiddle
over
pogson
head
presently
he
said
with
a
whimsical
twist
of
his
lips
you
may
have
heard
me
speak
of
a
crusader
mace
yes
master
that
when
i
used
it
i
had
an
inspiration
he
remarked
quietly
master
said
i
after
a
while
if
madame
de
verneuil
believed
you
to
be
dead
it
must
have
been
a
shock
to
her
when
she
saw
you
alive
at
she
learned
soon
after
her
marriage
that
her
husband
had
been
mistaken
her
mother
had
caught
sight
of
me
in
venice
madame
de
verneuil
never
forgave
him
the
lie
she
is
gentle
my
son
but
she
has
character
it
was
after
that
i
think
that
the
frozen
look
came
into
her
eyes
thenceforward
she
was
ice
to
the
comte
de
verneuil
who
for
pleasant
domestic
companionship
had
to
resort
to
his
rare
apes
no
wonder
his
madness
took
the
form
of
the
fixed
idea
that
he
had
murdered
paragot
after
all
he
mused
there
must
have
been
some
good
in
the
man
he
desired
to
make
amends
he
sent
me
the
old
contract
so
that
his
wife
should
not
find
it
after
his
death
he
confessed
everything
to
her
before
he
died
there
is
a
weak
spot
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
the
devil
himself
i
should
wonder
if
he
were
devoted
to
a
canary
master
said
i
suddenly
bethinking
me
of
the
canary
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
if
you
marry
madame
de
verneuil
what
will
become
of
blanquette
she
will
come
and
live
with
us
of
course
h
said
i
respect
forbade
downright
contradiction
i
could
only
marvel
mutely
at
his
pathetic
ignorance
of
woman
indeed
his
reply
gave
me
the
shock
of
an
unexpected
stone
wall
he
who
had
but
recently
taught
me
the
chart
of
fanchette
soul
to
be
unaware
of
elementary
axioms
did
i
not
remember
joanna
iciness
at
when
i
told
her
of
his
adoption
of
my
colleague
was
i
not
aware
of
poor
blanquette
miserable
jealousy
of
the
beautiful
lady
who
enquired
for
her
master
to
bring
these
two
together
seemed
even
to
my
boy
mind
a
ludicrous
impossibility
yet
paragot
spoke
with
the
unhumorous
gravity
of
a
methodist
parson
and
the
sincerity
of
a
maiden
lady
with
a
mission
to
obtain
good
situations
for
deserving
girls
a
man
so
please
you
who
had
gone
into
the
holes
and
corners
of
the
continent
of
europe
in
search
of
truth
who
had
come
face
to
face
with
human
nature
naked
and
unashamed
who
had
run
the
gamut
of
femininity
from
our
rare
princess
joanna
to
the
murderer
widow
of
prague
a
man
who
ought
to
have
had
so
sensitive
a
perception
that
the
most
subtle
and
elusive
harmonies
of
woman
were
as
familiar
to
him
as
their
providential
love
of
babies
or
their
ineradicable
passion
for
new
hats
he
lit
another
cigarette
having
dallied
in
a
somewhat
youthful
fashion
with
the
newly
acquired
case
and
blew
two
or
three
contented
puffs
i
believe
in
the
roman
conception
of
the
my
son
you
and
blanquette
are
included
in
mine
you
being
a
man
must
go
outside
the
world
and
make
your
way
but
blanquette
being
a
woman
must
remain
under
the
roof
of
the
which
is
myself
i
foresaw
trouble
when
he
left
me
after
dinner
to
pay
his
promised
visit
to
joanna
i
went
in
quest
of
cazalet
of
the
sandals
with
whom
i
spent
a
profitable
evening
discussing
the
question
of
subject
in
art
bringard
and
bonnet
and
himself
had
rented
a
dilapidated
stable
in
menilmontant
which
they
had
fitted
up
as
a
studio
and
as
his
two
colleagues
were
away
cazalet
had
displayed
his
own
horrific
canvases
all
over
the
place
the
argument
if
i
remember
right
was
chiefly
concerned
with
subject
in
art
over
which
we
fought
vehemently
but
though
the
sabre
of
his
father
hung
proudly
on
the
wall
he
did
not
challenge
me
to
a
duel
instead
he
invited
me
to
join
the
trio
in
the
rent
of
the
studio
and
i
suddenly
struck
with
the
advantage
and
importance
of
having
a
studio
of
my
own
gladly
accepted
the
proposal
when
one
can
say
my
studio
one
feels
that
one
is
definitely
beginning
one
professional
career
i
left
him
to
sleep
on
some
contrivance
of
sacking
which
he
called
a
bed
and
trudged
homewards
to
the
boulevard
curiosity
tempted
me
to
look
into
the
café
delphine
it
was
deserted
madame
boin
opened
her
fat
arms
wide
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
intervening
counter
would
have
clasped
me
to
her
bosom
what
had
become
of
monsieur
paragot
it
was
more
than
a
fortnight
since
he
had
been
in
the
café
i
lied
drank
a
glass
of
beer
and
went
home
i
could
not
take
away
paragot
character
by
declaring
his
reversion
to
respectability
chapter
xvi
my
taking
the
share
of
the
in
menilmontant
had
one
result
you
must
paint
my
portrait
said
joanna
madame
i
cried
if
i
only
could
what
is
your
charge
for
portraits
mr
asticot
paragot
set
down
his
and
looked
at
me
with
a
shade
of
anxiety
we
were
having
tea
at
the
hôtel
meurice
the
pleasure
of
looking
a
long
time
at
the
sitter
madame
said
i
that
is
very
well
said
my
son
paragot
remarked
you
will
not
make
a
fortune
that
way
however
if
you
play
for
love
this
time
she
smiled
and
handed
me
the
cakes
where
did
you
say
your
studio
was
but
madame
you
ca
go
there
i
expostulated
it
is
in
the
slums
of
menilmontant
beyond
the
cemetery
of
père
lachaise
the
place
is
all
tumbling
down
and
cazalet
sleeps
there
who
is
cazalet
a
caliban
in
sandals
said
paragot
joanna
clapped
her
hands
like
a
child
i
should
love
to
go
perhaps
de
nérac
would
come
with
me
and
protect
me
from
caliban
if
you
wo
she
added
seeing
that
paragot
was
about
to
raise
an
objection
i
will
go
by
myself
there
are
no
chairs
to
sit
upon
i
said
warningly
i
will
sit
upon
caliban
she
declared
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
i
painted
the
portrait
of
madame
de
verneuil
in
periods
of
ecstatic
happiness
and
trepidation
she
came
every
day
and
sat
with
unwearying
patience
on
what
we
called
the
model
throne
the
one
comfortless
wooden
the
studio
possessed
while
paragot
mounted
guard
near
by
on
an
empty
box
everything
delighted
her
the
approach
through
the
unsavoury
the
dirty
children
the
crazy
interior
cazalet
ghastly
and
unappreciated
masterpieces
even
cazalet
himself
who
now
and
then
would
slouch
awkwardly
about
the
place
trying
to
hide
his
toes
she
expressed
wonder
at
the
mysteries
of
my
art
and
vowed
she
saw
a
speaking
likeness
in
the
first
stages
of
chaotic
pinks
and
blues
i
have
never
seen
a
human
being
so
inordinately
contented
with
the
world
i
am
like
a
prisoner
who
has
been
kept
in
the
dark
and
is
let
out
free
into
the
sunshine
she
said
one
day
to
paragot
who
had
remarked
on
her
gaiety
i
want
to
run
about
and
dance
and
smell
flowers
and
clap
my
hands
in
these
moments
of
exuberance
she
seemed
to
cast
off
the
shadow
of
the
years
and
become
a
girl
again
i
regarded
her
as
my
contemporary
but
paragot
with
his
lined
face
looked
prematurely
old
only
now
and
then
when
he
got
into
fierce
argument
with
cazalet
and
swung
his
arms
about
and
mingled
his
asseverations
with
the
quaint
oaths
of
the
latin
quarter
did
he
relax
his
portentous
gravity
that
is
just
how
he
used
to
go
on
she
laughed
confidentially
to
me
her
face
close
to
mine
he
was
a
whirlwind
he
carried
everybody
off
their
feet
she
caught
my
eye
smiled
and
flushed
i
quite
understood
that
it
was
she
who
had
been
carried
off
her
feet
by
my
tempestuous
master
sacré
mille
cochons
tu
comprends
rien
du
tout
cried
paragot
at
that
moment
i
knowing
that
this
was
not
a
proper
expression
to
use
before
ladies
kept
up
the
confidential
glance
for
a
second
i
hope
he
did
use
such
dreadful
language
you
could
in
english
could
you
he
always
spoke
english
to
me
in
french
it
is
different
i
like
it
what
did
he
say
mille
cochons
she
imitated
him
delightfully
you
have
no
idea
what
a
dainty
musical
phrase
this
peculiarly
offensive
expletive
became
when
uttered
by
her
lips
after
all
she
said
it
only
means
thousand
pigs
but
why
are
you
painting
mr
asticot
because
you
have
got
entirely
out
of
pose
madame
whereupon
it
was
necessary
to
fix
her
head
again
and
my
silly
fingers
tingled
as
they
touched
her
hair
it
is
a
good
thing
for
a
boy
of
nineteen
to
be
romantically
in
love
with
joanna
he
can
thus
live
spiritually
beyond
his
means
without
much
danger
of
bankruptcy
and
his
extravagance
shall
be
counted
to
him
for
virtue
also
if
he
is
painting
the
princess
of
his
dreams
he
has
such
an
inspiration
as
is
given
but
to
the
elect
and
what
skill
he
is
possessed
of
must
succeed
in
its
purpose
one
morning
she
found
on
her
arrival
a
bowl
of
roses
which
i
had
bought
in
the
markets
placed
against
her
chair
on
the
dais
she
uttered
a
little
cry
of
pleasure
and
came
to
me
both
hands
outstretched
taking
mine
she
turned
her
head
in
an
adorable
attitude
half
upwards
to
paragot
i
believe
it
is
asticot
who
is
in
love
with
me
gaston
are
you
jealous
i
blushed
furiously
paragot
smiled
down
on
her
has
every
man
you
met
fallen
in
love
with
you
since
you
were
two
years
old
i
forgive
you
she
cried
because
you
still
can
make
pretty
speeches
thank
you
for
the
roses
asticot
if
i
wore
one
would
you
paint
it
in
or
would
it
spoil
your
colour
scheme
i
selected
the
rose
which
would
best
throw
up
the
pink
of
her
face
and
she
put
it
gaily
in
her
corsage
she
pirouetted
up
to
the
dais
and
with
a
whisk
of
skirts
seated
herself
on
the
throne
if
any
of
my
french
friends
and
relations
knew
i
were
doing
this
they
would
die
of
shock
it
lovely
to
defy
conventions
for
a
while
one
will
soon
have
to
yield
to
them
conventions
are
essential
for
the
smooth
conduct
of
social
affairs
remarked
paragot
she
looked
at
him
quizzically
my
dear
gaston
if
you
go
on
cultivating
such
unexceptional
sentiments
they
turn
into
a
churchwarden
as
soon
as
you
set
foot
in
melford
i
had
seen
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
a
churchwarden
in
somerset
a
local
cheesemonger
of
appalling
correctitude
if
paragot
ever
came
to
resemble
him
he
was
lost
there
would
be
an
entity
who
had
passed
through
paragot
experiences
but
there
would
be
no
more
paragot
you
must
save
him
madame
i
cried
from
being
made
a
churchwarden
paragot
lit
a
cigarette
i
watched
the
first
few
puffs
awaiting
a
repartee
none
came
i
felt
a
qualm
of
apprehension
was
he
already
becoming
i
did
not
realise
then
what
it
means
to
a
man
to
cast
aside
the
slough
of
many
years
decay
and
take
his
stand
clean
before
the
world
he
shivers
is
liable
to
catch
cold
like
the
tramp
whose
protective
hide
of
filth
is
summarily
removed
in
the
workhouse
bath
nor
did
my
dear
lady
realise
this
how
could
she
bright
freed
creature
hungering
after
the
long
withheld
joyousness
of
existence
and
overwilling
to
delude
herself
into
the
belief
that
every
shadow
was
a
ray
of
sunlight
she
had
no
notion
of
the
man
grotesque
struggles
to
conceal
the
shivering
sensitiveness
of
his
roughly
cleaned
soul
she
twitted
him
merrily
you
can
argue
like
a
tornado
with
monsieur
cazalet
but
you
think
i
must
be
talked
to
like
this
country
fille
à
is
he
perverse
asticot
i
think
i
am
quite
as
entertaining
as
caliban
well
you
see
when
he
talked
to
cazalet
he
slipped
on
the
slough
again
and
was
comfortable
he
waited
for
a
moment
or
two
as
if
he
were
composing
a
speech
and
then
rose
and
drawing
near
her
said
in
a
low
voice
thinking
that
as
i
was
absorbed
in
my
painting
i
could
not
hear
this
new
happiness
is
too
overwhelming
for
fantastic
talk
oh
no
it
is
she
declared
in
a
whisper
we
have
put
back
time
thirteen
years
we
wipe
out
of
our
minds
all
that
has
happened
in
them
and
start
just
where
we
left
off
you
were
fantastic
enough
then
in
all
conscience
i
had
the
world
at
my
feet
and
i
kicked
it
about
like
a
football
he
hunched
up
his
shoulders
in
a
helpless
gesture
somehow
the
football
burst
and
became
a
helpless
piece
of
leather
i
have
the
remotest
idea
what
you
mean
laughed
joanna
madame
said
i
if
you
turn
your
head
about
like
that
i
shall
get
you
all
out
of
drawing
oh
dear
said
joanna
resuming
her
pose
these
were
enchanted
days
i
think
for
all
of
us
even
cazalet
felt
the
influence
and
put
on
a
pair
of
gaudily
striped
socks
over
which
his
sandals
would
not
fit
joanna
was
very
tender
to
him
as
to
everybody
but
she
appeared
to
draw
her
skirts
around
her
on
passing
him
by
as
if
he
were
a
slug
which
she
did
not
love
but
could
not
harm
for
the
world
paragot
having
for
some
absurd
reason
forsworn
his
porcelain
pipe
smoked
the
cigarette
of
and
fulfilled
his
happiness
by
the
contemplation
of
joanna
and
myself
i
verily
believe
he
was
more
at
his
ease
when
i
was
with
them
as
for
the
portrait
he
viewed
its
progress
with
enthusiastic
interest
now
and
then
he
would
forget
himself
and
discourse
expansively
on
its
merits
to
the
delight
of
joanna
he
regarded
it
as
his
own
production
had
he
not
bought
this
poor
little
devil
and
all
his
works
for
ergo
the
work
taking
shape
on
the
canvas
was
his
paragot
what
could
be
more
logical
and
it
was
he
who
had
given
me
my
first
lessons
no
mother
showing
off
a
precocious
brat
to
her
gossips
could
have
displayed
more
overweening
pride
it
was
pathetic
and
i
loved
him
for
it
and
so
did
joanna
the
time
came
however
all
too
soon
madame
de
verneuil
could
live
in
her
land
of
cockaigne
no
longer
convention
claimed
her
her
cousin
major
walters
was
coming
from
england
to
aid
her
in
final
arrangements
with
the
lawyers
and
he
was
to
carry
her
off
in
a
day
or
two
to
melford
at
the
end
of
the
last
sitting
she
looked
round
the
dismal
place
it
had
discoloured
uneven
bulging
whitewashed
walls
an
unutterably
dirty
loose
plank
floor
and
a
skylight
patched
with
maps
of
hideous
worlds
on
mercator
projection
and
was
furnished
with
packing
cases
and
grime
and
the
sacking
which
was
cazalet
bed
and
sighed
wistfully
as
if
she
had
been
an
unoffending
eve
thrust
out
of
eden
i
have
been
so
happy
here
she
said
to
me
i
wonder
whether
i
shall
ever
be
so
happy
again
do
you
think
i
shall
i
noticed
her
give
a
swift
sidelong
glance
almost
imperceptible
at
paragot
who
had
sauntered
down
the
studio
to
look
at
one
of
pictures
the
first
time
you
saw
me
she
added
as
i
found
nothing
to
say
you
announced
that
you
were
learning
philosophy
have
you
learned
enough
yet
to
answer
me
madame
i
replied
driven
into
a
corner
happiness
is
such
an
awfully
funny
thing
you
find
it
when
you
least
expect
it
and
when
you
expect
it
you
often
do
find
it
is
that
supposed
to
be
comforting
or
depressing
mr
asticot
i
think
we
had
better
ask
my
master
madame
i
said
he
can
tell
you
better
than
i
but
she
shook
her
head
and
did
not
ask
paragot
my
son
said
paragot
that
evening
by
his
window
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
trying
to
disintegrate
some
fresh
air
from
the
fetid
odours
that
rose
from
the
narrow
street
below
you
have
won
madame
de
verneuil
heart
you
are
a
lucky
little
asticot
and
i
am
proud
of
you
because
i
made
you
you
are
a
proof
to
her
that
i
have
spent
all
my
life
in
absorbing
absinthe
and
omitting
to
decorate
europe
with
palaces
instead
of
bricks
and
mortar
i
have
worked
in
and
my
masterpiece
is
an
artist
and
a
great
artist
by
the
lord
god
he
cried
with
sudden
access
of
passion
if
you
will
keep
sorrowful
great
gift
pure
and
undefiled
as
a
good
woman
does
her
chastity
you
must
help
me
in
my
work
my
son
let
me
be
able
to
point
to
you
as
the
one
man
in
the
world
who
does
not
prostitute
his
art
for
money
or
reputation
who
sees
god
beneath
a
leper
skin
and
proclaims
him
bravely
who
reveals
the
magical
beauty
of
humanity
and
compels
the
fool
and
the
knave
and
the
man
with
the
and
the
harlot
to
see
it
and
sends
them
away
with
hope
in
their
hearts
and
faith
in
the
destiny
of
the
race
and
charity
to
one
another
let
me
see
this
my
son
and
by
heavens
i
shall
have
done
more
with
my
life
than
erect
a
temple
made
by
hands
and
i
shall
have
justified
my
existence
you
will
do
this
for
me
asticot
i
was
young
i
was
impressionable
i
loved
the
man
with
a
passionate
gratitude
i
gave
my
promise
heaven
knows
i
have
tried
to
keep
it
with
what
success
is
neither
here
nor
there
the
fantastic
element
in
the
psychological
state
of
paragot
i
did
not
consider
then
but
now
it
moves
me
almost
to
tears
just
think
of
it
i
was
his
one
pro
vita
his
one
good
work
which
he
presented
with
outstretched
hands
and
pleading
eyes
to
joanna
i
love
the
man
too
well
to
say
more
madame
de
verneuil
went
away
leaving
both
of
us
desolate
even
the
prospect
of
visiting
melford
a
month
hence
at
rushworth
cordial
invitation
only
intermittently
raised
paragot
spirits
it
did
not
affect
mine
at
all
i
felt
that
a
glory
had
faded
from
menilmontant
still
i
had
the
portrait
to
finish
and
the
preliminary
sketches
to
make
of
a
deuce
of
a
mythological
picture
for
which
cazalet
and
fanchette
who
for
want
of
better
company
had
become
addicted
during
august
to
my
colleague
were
to
serve
as
models
i
had
my
head
and
hands
full
of
occupation
whereas
the
reorganized
paragot
had
none
he
talked
in
a
great
way
of
resuming
his
profession
and
even
went
the
length
of
buying
and
pins
and
and
and
dividers
and
other
working
tools
of
the
architect
but
as
a
man
can
not
design
a
palace
or
a
pigstye
and
put
it
on
the
market
as
one
can
a
book
or
a
picture
he
made
little
headway
with
his
project
he
obtained
the
conditions
of
an
open
competition
for
an
infectious
diseases
hospital
somewhere
in
auvergne
and
talked
grandiosely
about
this
for
a
day
or
two
but
when
he
came
to
set
out
the
plan
he
found
that
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
the
modern
requirements
of
such
a
building
and
cared
less
i
will
wait
my
son
until
there
is
something
worthy
of
an
endeavour
a
palace
of
justice
in
an
important
town
or
an
opera
house
hospitals
for
infectious
diseases
do
not
inspire
one
and
i
need
inspiration
besides
the
visit
to
melford
would
break
the
continuity
of
my
work
i
begin
my
son
asticot
when
i
come
back
and
then
you
will
see
an
ancient
prix
de
rome
de
nom
has
artistic
responsibilities
he
must
come
back
in
splendour
like
holger
danske
when
he
wakes
from
his
enchanted
slumber
to
conquer
the
earth
poor
holger
danske
when
he
does
wake
up
he
will
find
his
conquering
methods
a
trifle
out
of
date
paragot
did
not
take
this
view
of
his
simile
i
believed
him
however
and
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
his
winning
design
for
a
cathedral
would
strike
awe
into
a
flabbergasted
world
my
son
said
he
a
day
or
two
after
he
had
resolved
upon
this
resurrection
in
state
i
want
blanquette
an
orderly
household
can
not
be
properly
conducted
by
the
intermittent
ministrations
of
a
concierge
our
good
blanquette
believing
as
i
had
done
that
the
master
was
riding
about
france
on
a
donkey
was
still
in
villégiatura
with
our
farmer
friends
near
chartres
and
in
order
that
she
should
have
as
long
a
holiday
as
possible
he
had
hitherto
forbidden
me
to
enlighten
her
as
to
his
change
of
project
besides
he
added
blanquette
has
a
place
in
my
heart
which
the
concierge
has
i
also
want
those
i
love
to
share
the
happiness
that
has
fallen
to
my
lot
you
will
write
to
her
my
son
and
ask
whether
she
wants
to
come
home
she
will
take
the
first
train
said
i
blanquette
is
a
curious
type
of
the
absolute
feminine
he
remarked
she
is
never
happier
than
when
she
can
regard
us
as
a
couple
of
babies
her
greatest
delight
would
be
to
wash
us
and
feed
us
with
a
spoon
master
said
i
somewhat
timidly
i
think
blanquette
is
sometimes
just
a
little
bit
miserable
because
you
do
seem
to
care
for
her
he
regarded
me
in
astonishment
i
not
care
for
blanquette
but
you
ridiculous
little
lump
of
idiocy
will
you
never
understand
she
like
you
is
part
of
myself
he
thumped
his
chest
as
usual
in
the
name
of
petticoats
what
does
she
want
in
russia
i
met
an
honest
german
artisan
who
had
married
a
peasant
girl
after
a
month
unclouded
existence
she
broke
down
beneath
the
load
of
misery
her
husband
did
love
her
why
because
they
had
been
married
a
whole
month
and
he
had
beaten
her
yet
does
the
child
want
me
to
beat
her
i
believe
lots
of
women
do
and
you
mindless
little
donkey
what
do
you
want
me
to
make
of
her
your
head
is
full
of
the
imbecilities
of
the
studio
because
i
keep
her
here
like
my
daughter
and
have
not
made
her
my
mistress
you
take
it
upon
yourself
to
conclude
that
i
have
no
affection
for
her
bah
you
know
nothing
you
have
lived
with
me
all
these
years
and
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
me
you
do
even
know
blanquette
beneath
an
unprepossessing
exterior
she
has
a
heart
of
gold
she
has
every
quality
that
a
woman
can
stuff
into
her
nature
she
would
live
on
and
egg
shells
if
she
thought
it
would
benefit
either
of
us
i
not
care
for
blanquette
you
shall
see
so
the
following
afternoon
when
we
met
blanquette
train
at
the
gare
paragot
had
taken
her
into
his
arms
and
planted
a
kiss
on
each
of
her
broad
cheeks
before
she
realised
who
the
magnificent
welcomer
in
the
silk
hat
really
was
when
he
released
her
she
stared
at
him
even
as
i
had
done
que
que
ça
she
cried
and
i
am
sure
that
the
comfort
of
his
kisses
was
lost
in
her
entire
bewilderment
it
is
the
master
blanquette
said
i
i
know
but
you
are
no
longer
the
same
i
should
have
recognised
you
do
you
prefer
me
as
i
used
to
be
said
blanquette
i
burst
out
laughing
she
is
saying
to
the
silk
hat
she
scolded
but
it
is
true
she
turned
to
the
master
and
asked
him
how
he
had
enjoyed
his
holiday
i
never
went
my
little
blanquette
you
have
been
in
paris
all
the
time
yes
and
you
only
send
for
me
now
but
dieu
how
have
you
been
living
visions
of
hideous
upheaval
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
floated
before
her
mind
and
she
hurried
forward
as
if
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
in
getting
there
when
we
arrived
she
held
up
hands
the
dust
the
dirt
the
state
of
the
kitchen
the
master
bedroom
oh
no
decidedly
she
would
not
leave
him
again
she
would
only
go
to
the
country
after
she
had
seen
him
well
started
in
the
train
with
a
ticket
for
a
long
way
beyond
paris
there
was
a
week
work
in
front
of
her
anyway
my
little
blanquette
said
paragot
you
are
glad
to
be
with
me
it
is
never
of
my
own
free
will
that
i
would
leave
you
she
replied
chapter
xviii
you
perceive
said
paragot
waving
a
complacent
hand
as
soon
as
blanquette
had
retired
to
make
the
necessary
purchases
for
the
evening
meal
you
perceive
that
she
is
perfectly
happy
you
were
entirely
wrong
all
is
for
the
best
in
this
best
of
all
possible
worlds
when
my
master
adopted
the
panglossian
view
of
the
universe
i
used
no
arguments
that
might
cloud
his
serenity
i
acquiesced
with
mental
reservations
we
talked
for
a
time
paragot
sitting
primly
on
a
chair
he
had
abandoned
his
sprawling
attitudes
for
fear
i
suspect
of
spoiling
his
new
clothes
the
position
however
not
making
for
ease
of
conversation
he
presently
took
up
a
book
and
began
to
read
while
i
amused
myself
idly
by
making
a
furtive
sketch
of
him
since
his
metamorphosis
he
was
by
no
means
the
entertaining
companion
of
his
unregenerate
days
he
himself
was
oppressed
i
fancy
by
his
own
correctitude
the
eternal
reading
which
filled
so
much
of
his
life
did
not
afford
him
the
same
wholehearted
enjoyment
now
as
it
did
when
he
lolled
dishevelled
pipe
in
mouth
and
glass
within
reach
on
bed
or
sofa
this
afternoon
i
noticed
he
yawned
and
fidgeted
in
his
chair
and
paid
to
his
book
the
distracted
attention
of
a
person
reading
a
back
number
of
a
magazine
in
a
dentist
waiting
room
my
sketch
which
i
happen
to
have
preserved
shows
a
singularly
bored
paragot
at
last
he
laid
the
book
aside
and
gathering
together
hat
gloves
and
umbrella
the
precious
appanages
of
his
new
estate
he
announced
his
intention
of
taking
the
air
before
dinner
i
remained
indoors
to
gossip
with
blanquette
during
its
preparation
i
had
considerable
doubts
as
to
her
optimistic
view
of
things
and
these
were
confirmed
as
soon
as
the
outer
door
closed
behind
my
master
and
the
salon
door
opened
to
admit
blanquette
she
came
to
me
with
an
agitated
expression
on
her
face
which
did
not
accord
with
perfect
happiness
of
spirit
donc
she
cried
what
does
it
mean
why
did
the
master
not
go
on
his
holiday
why
did
he
not
send
for
me
why
has
he
cut
off
his
hair
and
beard
and
dressed
himself
like
a
i
know
very
well
the
master
is
a
gentleman
but
why
has
he
changed
from
what
he
used
to
be
i
temporised
my
dear
said
i
when
you
first
knew
me
i
wore
a
blue
blouse
and
boots
with
wooden
soles
almost
the
last
time
you
had
the
happiness
of
beholding
me
i
was
clad
in
the
purple
and
fine
linen
of
a
you
were
alarmed
at
my
putting
on
civilised
garments
why
should
you
be
excited
at
the
master
doing
the
same
if
you
talk
like
the
master
i
shall
detest
you
exclaimed
blanquette
you
do
it
because
you
are
hiding
something
mon
petit
she
said
with
a
change
of
tone
and
putting
her
arm
round
my
neck
tell
me
what
is
happening
he
is
going
to
be
married
to
the
beautiful
lady
eh
she
looked
into
my
eyes
hers
were
deep
and
brown
and
a
world
of
pain
lay
behind
them
i
am
a
bad
liar
she
freed
me
roughly
i
see
it
is
true
he
is
going
to
be
married
he
does
not
want
me
any
longer
it
is
all
finished
o
dieu
mon
what
is
to
become
of
me
she
wept
rubbing
away
the
tears
with
her
knuckles
i
tried
to
comfort
her
and
lent
her
my
she
need
have
no
fear
i
said
as
long
as
the
master
lived
her
comfort
was
assured
she
turned
on
me
do
you
think
i
would
let
him
keep
me
in
idleness
while
he
was
married
to
another
woman
but
no
it
would
be
i
would
never
do
such
a
thing
she
looked
at
me
almost
fiercely
there
was
something
noble
in
her
pride
it
would
be
dishonourable
to
accept
without
giving
she
would
never
do
that
never
but
what
will
become
of
you
my
dear
blanquette
i
asked
look
asticot
i
would
give
him
all
that
he
would
ask
i
am
his
all
all
to
do
what
he
likes
with
i
have
told
you
i
would
sleep
on
the
ground
outside
his
door
every
night
if
that
were
his
good
pleasure
it
is
not
much
that
i
demand
but
he
must
be
alone
in
the
room
another
woman
comes
to
cherish
him
and
i
no
longer
have
any
place
near
him
i
must
be
far
away
and
what
would
be
the
good
of
being
far
away
from
him
what
shall
i
do
as
soon
as
he
marries
vais
me
fich
à
you
are
going
to
do
i
cried
incredulously
she
repeated
that
she
would
chuck
herself
into
the
river
fich
à
is
not
the
french
of
racine
i
remonstrated
she
retorted
that
if
she
could
not
keep
the
master
house
in
order
there
was
nothing
left
to
live
for
much
better
be
dead
than
eat
your
heart
out
in
misery
you
are
talking
like
a
wicked
girl
said
i
severely
and
it
will
be
my
duty
to
tell
the
master
she
gave
her
eyes
a
final
dab
with
my
handkerchief
which
she
restored
to
me
with
an
air
of
scornful
resentment
if
you
do
you
will
be
infamous
and
i
will
never
speak
to
you
again
as
long
as
i
live
i
descended
from
my
rhadamanthine
seat
and
reflected
that
the
betrayal
of
blanquette
confidence
would
not
be
a
gallant
action
i
maintained
my
dignity
however
then
i
must
hear
nothing
more
about
you
drowning
yourself
we
will
not
talk
of
it
any
longer
said
blanquette
frigidly
i
am
going
to
cook
the
dinner
as
the
prim
salon
provided
little
interest
for
an
idle
youth
i
followed
her
into
the
slip
of
a
kitchen
where
i
lounged
in
great
contentment
and
discomfort
blanquette
relapsed
into
her
fatalistic
attitude
towards
life
and
seemed
to
dismiss
the
disastrous
subject
from
her
mind
while
she
prepared
the
simple
meal
she
entertained
me
with
an
account
of
the
farm
near
chartres
there
were
so
many
cows
so
many
ducks
and
hens
and
so
many
pigs
she
rose
at
five
every
morning
and
milked
the
cows
oh
she
had
milked
cows
as
a
child
and
had
not
forgotten
the
art
it
was
difficult
for
those
who
did
not
know
she
demonstrated
with
finger
and
thumb
and
a
lettuce
how
it
was
done
i
shall
not
forget
it
said
i
it
is
good
to
know
things
she
remarked
seriously
one
never
can
tell
said
i
when
a
cow
will
come
to
you
weeping
to
be
milked
especially
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
that
is
true
replied
blanquette
the
oddest
things
happen
sometimes
light
satire
was
lost
on
blanquette
after
dinner
she
continued
the
recital
of
her
adventures
for
the
master
delectation
the
old
couple
no
longer
able
to
look
after
the
farm
were
desirous
of
selling
it
so
that
they
could
retire
to
evreux
where
their
only
son
who
had
married
a
rich
wife
kept
a
prosperous
hotel
do
you
know
what
they
said
master
does
not
monsieur
paragot
who
must
be
very
rich
buy
it
from
us
and
come
to
live
in
the
country
instead
of
that
dirty
paris
drôle
hein
why
do
they
think
i
am
very
rich
that
is
what
i
asked
them
they
said
if
a
man
did
not
work
he
must
be
either
rich
or
a
rogue
and
they
know
you
are
not
a
rogue
they
flatter
me
said
paragot
would
you
like
to
live
in
the
country
blanquette
oh
yes
she
cried
with
conviction
y
a
des
bêtes
and
then
it
smells
so
good
it
does
he
sighed
i
have
smelt
it
for
over
three
years
ah
to
have
the
scent
of
the
good
wet
earth
in
one
nostrils
and
the
sound
of
bees
in
one
ears
for
two
pins
i
would
go
gipsying
again
if
i
were
a
rich
man
my
little
blanquette
i
would
buy
the
farm
and
give
it
you
as
your
dowry
and
sometimes
you
would
let
me
come
and
stay
with
you
but
as
i
shall
never
marry
there
will
be
no
need
of
a
dowry
she
said
it
smilingly
as
if
she
welcomed
her
lot
as
a
predestined
old
maid
there
was
not
a
sign
on
her
plain
pleasant
face
of
the
torment
raging
in
her
bosom
in
my
youthful
ignorance
i
did
not
know
whether
to
deplore
woman
deceit
or
to
admire
her
my
child
said
paragot
no
human
being
can
without
arrogance
say
what
he
will
or
what
he
will
not
do
least
of
all
a
woman
having
uttered
this
profound
piece
of
wisdom
my
master
went
to
bed
during
the
next
few
weeks
paragot
suffered
the
boredom
of
a
provisional
condition
of
existence
he
went
to
bed
early
for
lack
of
evening
entertainment
and
rose
late
in
the
morning
for
lack
of
daily
occupation
with
what
he
termed
the
crapulous
years
he
had
divested
himself
of
his
former
associates
and
habits
friends
that
would
harmonise
with
his
gloves
and
umbrella
he
had
none
as
yet
if
he
ordered
an
before
the
midday
meal
it
was
on
the
terrace
of
a
café
on
the
boulevard
where
he
sat
devouring
newspapers
in
awful
solitude
sometimes
he
took
blanquette
for
a
sedate
walk
but
no
longer
blanquette
he
bought
her
a
mystical
headgear
composed
as
far
as
i
could
see
of
three
plums
and
a
couple
of
feathers
which
the
girl
wore
with
an
air
of
happy
martyrdom
he
discoursed
to
her
on
the
weather
and
the
political
situation
at
this
period
he
began
to
develop
republican
sympathies
formerly
he
had
swung
according
to
the
caprice
of
the
moment
from
an
irreconcilable
nationalism
to
a
fantastic
anarchism
now
he
was
proud
to
identify
himself
with
the
once
despised
he
would
have
taken
to
his
bosom
the
draper
papa
of
hedwige
of
cassel
most
of
his
time
he
spent
in
the
studio
at
menilmontant
there
at
any
rate
he
was
at
ease
we
were
not
too
disreputable
for
the
umbrella
and
though
he
deprecated
the
loose
speech
of
bringard
and
bonnet
who
had
returned
to
paris
and
the
queer
personal
habits
of
cazalet
he
appeared
to
find
solace
in
our
society
at
any
rate
the
visits
gave
him
occupation
he
also
posed
for
the
body
of
thiers
in
an
historical
picture
which
bringard
proposed
to
exhibit
at
the
salon
the
following
spring
propose
et
dieu
said
paragot
if
he
is
anything
of
a
judge
this
ought
to
be
hung
on
the
line
said
bonnet
i
regret
to
say
the
picture
was
rejected
at
last
the
time
came
for
the
melford
visit
paragot
consulted
ewing
and
myself
earnestly
as
to
his
outfit
and
though
he
clung
to
his
suit
as
a
garb
of
ceremony
we
succeeded
in
sending
him
away
with
a
semblance
of
english
attire
he
took
with
him
my
portrait
of
joanna
packed
in
a
wooden
case
and
bearing
to
my
great
pride
the
legend
precious
work
of
art
with
great
care
in
french
and
english
when
he
had
gone
i
moved
my
belongings
from
my
attic
to
the
rue
des
saladiers
and
gave
myself
up
to
the
ministrations
of
blanquette
a
little
while
later
i
received
from
my
dear
lady
an
invitation
to
visit
melford
and
paint
the
portrait
of
her
mother
who
regarded
my
portrait
of
joanna
as
a
work
of
genius
if
you
are
a
young
artist
it
makes
your
head
spin
very
pleasantly
to
hear
yourself
alluded
to
as
a
genius
later
in
life
you
do
not
quite
like
it
for
you
have
bitter
knowledge
of
your
limitations
and
are
mortally
afraid
your
kind
flatterers
will
find
you
out
but
at
twenty
you
really
do
not
know
whether
you
are
a
genius
or
not
rushworth
however
backed
her
opinion
with
a
hundred
guineas
a
hundred
guineas
when
i
read
the
words
i
uttered
a
wild
shriek
which
brought
blanquette
in
a
fright
from
the
bedroom
it
was
a
commission
joanna
explained
and
i
was
to
accept
it
just
like
any
other
artist
and
i
was
to
stay
with
them
again
like
any
other
artist
during
the
sittings
i
am
to
go
to
england
to
paint
another
portrait
blanquette
how
much
do
you
think
i
shall
be
paid
for
it
much
queried
blanquette
in
her
deliberate
way
i
indicated
with
swinging
arms
a
balloon
of
gold
blanquette
reflected
fifty
francs
two
thousand
six
hundred
and
twenty
five
francs
i
cried
blanquette
sat
down
in
order
to
realise
the
sum
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
conceive
thousands
of
francs
that
will
make
you
rich
for
the
rest
of
your
life
it
is
only
the
beginning
i
exclaimed
hopefully
blanquette
shook
a
reproachful
head
there
are
some
folks
who
are
never
satisfied
she
said
chapter
xix
when
i
arrived
at
melford
my
head
was
full
of
painting
and
and
for
the
first
week
or
so
rushworth
my
subject
occupied
the
centre
of
my
stage
she
was
a
placid
lady
of
sixty
whose
hair
once
golden
had
turned
a
flossy
white
and
whose
apple
cheeks
though
still
retaining
their
plumpness
had
grown
waxen
and
were
by
innumerable
tiny
lines
the
light
blue
of
her
eyes
had
faded
and
the
rich
redness
of
her
lips
had
turned
to
faint
coral
one
could
trace
how
time
had
day
by
day
touched
her
with
light
but
unfaltering
fingers
now
abstracting
a
fleck
of
brightness
now
lowering
by
an
imperceptible
shade
a
tone
of
colour
until
she
had
become
what
i
saw
her
still
the
pink
and
white
beauty
but
with
rose
all
deadened
into
white
like
a
sick
pink
pearl
her
pink
and
white
character
had
also
suffered
the
effacement
of
the
years
she
was
as
dainty
and
as
negative
as
a
piece
of
dresden
china
she
loved
to
dress
in
lilac
and
old
lace
and
that
is
how
i
painted
her
regarding
her
as
a
bit
of
exquisite
decoration
to
be
treated
flat
like
a
panel
of
puvis
de
chavannes
my
young
head
i
say
was
full
of
the
masterpiece
i
was
about
to
execute
and
though
i
found
much
joy
in
renewed
intercourse
with
my
beloved
lady
and
my
master
i
took
no
particular
note
of
their
relations
we
met
at
meals
sometimes
in
the
afternoons
and
always
of
evenings
when
i
played
dutiful
piquet
with
rushworth
while
joanna
made
music
on
the
piano
and
paragot
read
jane
austen
in
an
by
the
fire
to
me
the
quietude
of
the
secluded
english
home
had
an
undefinable
charm
like
the
smell
of
lavender
for
which
i
have
always
had
a
affection
not
having
the
bohemian
temperament
i
am
now
the
most
smugly
comfortable
painter
in
europe
i
was
perfectly
happy
i
took
no
thought
of
paragot
whose
temperament
was
essentially
bohemian
and
how
he
enjoyed
the
gentle
monotony
of
the
days
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
consider
outwardly
he
shewed
no
sign
of
impatience
a
dean
might
have
taken
him
as
a
model
of
decorum
and
when
he
drove
of
afternoons
with
joanna
in
the
no
dyspeptic
bishop
could
have
assumed
his
air
of
grim
urbanity
but
after
a
while
i
realised
that
the
old
paragot
still
smouldered
within
him
and
now
and
then
it
burst
into
unregenerate
flame
rushworth
had
inherited
from
her
father
an
old
georgian
house
at
the
end
of
the
high
street
of
melford
he
had
been
the
duke
of
wiltshire
agent
and
a
person
of
note
in
the
town
rushworth
also
was
a
person
of
note
and
her
beautiful
daughter
the
countess
a
lady
of
fortune
became
a
person
of
greater
note
still
now
on
tuesday
afternoons
rushworth
was
at
home
we
saw
a
vast
deal
of
society
ladies
of
county
families
parsons
wives
doctors
wives
and
the
female
belongings
of
the
gentlemen
farmers
round
about
there
were
also
a
stray
hunting
man
a
curate
or
two
and
major
walters
the
callers
sat
about
the
drawing
room
in
little
groups
drinking
tea
and
discoursing
on
unimportant
and
unintelligible
matters
and
seemed
oddly
shy
of
paragot
and
myself
whom
joanna
always
introduced
most
graciously
they
preferred
to
talk
among
themselves
i
considered
them
impolite
which
no
doubt
they
were
but
i
have
since
reflected
that
paragot
was
an
unusual
guest
at
an
english
country
and
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
that
an
english
country
resents
it
is
the
unusual
i
am
sure
that
a
square
muffin
would
be
considered
an
indelicacy
on
the
second
of
these
tuesday
gatherings
which
i
was
privileged
to
attend
joanna
presented
me
to
two
young
women
the
daughters
i
gathered
of
people
who
had
country
places
near
by
pradel
is
the
artist
from
paris
who
is
painting
mamma
portrait
she
explained
i
bowed
and
remarked
that
i
was
enchanted
to
make
their
acquaintance
they
stared
i
know
now
that
this
gallic
mode
of
address
is
not
usual
in
melford
one
young
woman
recovering
from
the
shock
said
she
would
like
to
be
an
artist
the
other
asked
me
whether
i
had
been
to
the
academy
i
said
no
i
lived
in
paris
then
had
i
been
to
the
salon
at
janot
said
i
with
the
idiot
egregiousness
of
youth
we
go
to
the
salon
why
asked
the
first
looking
across
the
room
apparently
at
a
curate
on
principle
i
answered
in
the
first
place
it
costs
a
franc
which
might
be
spent
in
food
and
raiment
and
in
the
second
we
desire
to
preserve
our
ideals
from
the
contaminating
spectacle
of
commercial
art
do
you
play
much
tennis
asked
number
two
with
no
desire
to
snub
me
as
i
deserved
for
fatuity
but
through
sheer
lack
of
interest
in
my
observation
no
said
i
shoot
no
there
is
not
much
shooting
to
be
got
in
the
boulevard
oh
she
remarked
where
that
paris
said
i
oh
yes
you
live
in
paris
and
she
regarded
me
with
the
expression
of
bored
curiosity
exhibited
by
a
superior
child
before
the
yak
enclosure
at
the
zoological
gardens
an
english
maiden
cosmic
horizon
was
sadly
limited
in
those
days
now
i
believe
she
has
extended
it
to
include
the
more
depressing
forms
of
drama
when
she
pays
her
annual
visit
to
london
there
was
a
silence
after
which
she
enquired
whether
i
fished
as
my
ideas
of
fishing
were
restricted
to
the
patient
hosts
pale
shades
of
acheron
who
have
angled
off
the
quays
of
the
seine
for
centuries
and
have
till
now
caught
nothing
i
smiled
and
shook
my
head
the
browns
have
taken
a
fishing
in
scotland
observed
number
one
taking
her
eyes
from
the
curate
and
i
to
join
them
next
month
myra
brown
is
going
to
be
married
i
hear
at
christmas
what
is
he
like
the
hitherto
unspeculative
eyes
of
the
young
woman
lit
up
an
answering
gleam
awoke
in
the
other
myra
brown
and
her
engagement
absorbed
their
attention
and
i
slunk
back
in
my
chair
forgotten
i
suffered
agonies
of
shyness
i
disliked
these
foolish
virgins
and
longed
to
flee
from
them
but
how
to
rise
and
make
my
escape
without
rudeness
passed
my
powers
of
invention
i
looked
around
me
at
the
on
the
farther
side
of
the
room
stood
joanna
and
major
walters
he
was
a
tall
soldierly
man
with
a
blond
moustache
and
fair
hair
thinning
on
the
crown
there
are
about
two
thousand
like
him
at
the
present
moment
on
the
active
and
retired
list
of
the
british
army
he
seemed
to
be
talking
earnestly
to
her
for
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
point
of
her
shoe
which
she
moved
slightly
from
side
to
side
presently
she
flashed
a
glance
at
him
somewhat
angrily
and
her
lips
moved
as
though
she
said
what
right
have
you
to
speak
like
that
he
made
the
englishman
awkward
paraphrase
of
the
shrug
looked
swiftly
over
at
paragot
and
turned
to
her
with
a
remark
then
for
the
first
time
since
the
comte
de
verneuil
death
the
glacier
blue
came
into
her
eyes
she
said
something
he
executed
a
little
stiff
bow
and
walked
away
joanna
bearing
herself
very
haughtily
crossed
the
room
with
a
cup
of
tea
for
a
new
arrival
paragot
gaunt
and
in
his
famous
frock
coat
he
had
donned
it
for
the
ceremonious
afternoon
but
joanna
i
think
had
suppressed
the
purple
cravat
with
the
yellow
spots
was
talking
to
an
elderly
and
bony
female
owning
a
great
beak
of
a
nose
i
wondered
how
so
unprepossessing
a
person
could
be
admitted
into
a
refined
assembly
but
i
learned
later
that
she
was
lady
molyneux
one
of
the
great
personages
of
the
county
the
lady
seemed
to
be
emphatic
so
did
paragot
she
regarded
him
stonily
out
of
eyes
he
waved
his
hands
she
raised
her
eyebrows
she
was
one
of
those
women
whose
eyebrows
in
the
normal
state
are
about
three
inches
from
the
eyelids
i
understood
then
what
superciliousness
meant
paragot
raised
his
voice
at
that
moment
one
of
those
strange
coincidences
occurred
in
which
the
ends
of
all
casual
conversations
fell
together
and
a
shaft
of
silence
sped
through
the
room
killing
all
sound
save
that
of
paragot
utterance
but
great
heavens
madam
babies
do
grow
in
the
cabbage
patch
and
you
are
all
well
aware
they
do
and
it
criminal
of
your
english
writers
to
mislead
the
young
as
to
the
facts
of
existence
charlotte
yonge
is
infinitely
more
immoral
than
guy
de
maupassant
then
paragot
realized
the
dead
stillness
he
rose
from
his
chair
looked
around
at
the
shocked
faces
of
the
women
and
curates
and
laughing
turned
to
rushworth
i
was
stating
zola
to
be
a
great
ethical
teacher
and
lady
molyneux
seemed
disinclined
to
believe
me
he
is
an
author
very
little
read
in
melford
said
the
placid
lady
from
her
sofa
cushions
while
the
two
or
three
women
with
whom
she
was
in
converse
gazed
disapprovingly
at
my
master
it
would
do
the
town
good
if
it
were
steeped
in
his
writings
said
he
as
this
was
at
a
period
when
like
hell
you
could
not
mention
the
name
of
zola
to
ears
polite
no
one
ventured
to
argue
the
matter
rushworth
plump
faded
lips
quivered
helplessly
and
it
was
with
a
gush
of
gratitude
that
she
seized
the
hand
of
one
of
the
ladies
who
rose
to
take
her
leave
and
save
the
situation
the
little
spell
of
shock
was
broken
groups
resumed
their
mysterious
conversations
and
paragot
swung
to
the
and
stood
there
in
solitary
defiance
i
seized
the
opportunity
to
escape
from
my
two
damsels
as
i
passed
lady
molyneux
she
turned
to
her
neighbour
what
a
dreadful
man
she
said
i
entirely
disapprove
of
rushworth
having
such
persons
in
her
house
i
could
have
wept
with
rage
here
was
this
ugly
woman
so
in
my
presumption
i
called
her
daring
to
speak
slightingly
of
my
beloved
master
who
had
condescended
to
speak
out
of
his
olympian
wisdom
and
no
fire
from
zeus
shrivelled
her
up
she
signified
her
disapproval
with
the
air
of
a
and
the
other
woman
acquiesced
i
longed
to
flame
into
defence
of
paragot
but
remembering
how
ill
i
fared
on
a
similar
occasion
when
a
member
of
the
lotus
club
accused
him
of
having
led
a
bear
in
warsaw
i
wisely
held
my
peace
but
i
was
very
angry
i
joined
paragot
on
the
presently
joanna
came
with
her
silvery
laugh
you
must
be
so
dreadfully
emphatic
gaston
she
said
unintelligent
women
must
not
lay
down
the
law
on
matters
they
understand
said
paragot
but
it
was
lady
molyneux
which
signifies
the
sovereign
lady
of
melford
god
help
melford
ejaculated
my
master
when
the
ladies
had
left
us
that
evening
after
dinner
paragot
poured
out
a
glass
of
port
and
pushed
the
decanter
across
to
me
my
son
said
he
as
a
philosopher
and
a
citizen
of
the
world
you
will
find
melford
repay
patient
study
as
much
as
chambéry
or
or
the
latin
quarter
it
is
a
garden
of
lilliput
here
you
will
see
life
in
its
most
cultivated
littleness
a
great
passion
bursting
out
across
the
way
would
convulse
the
town
like
an
earthquake
observe
at
the
same
time
how
constant
a
factor
is
human
nature
however
variable
the
manifestation
may
be
the
degree
is
invariable
in
spacious
conditions
it
manifests
itself
in
passions
in
narrow
ones
in
prejudices
the
females
in
and
out
of
petticoats
who
were
here
this
afternoon
experience
the
same
thrill
in
expressing
their
dislike
of
me
as
a
person
foreign
to
their
convention
as
the
sicilian
who
plunges
his
dagger
into
a
bosom
when
i
am
married
my
son
i
shall
not
live
at
melford
where
do
you
propose
to
live
master
i
enquired
he
made
a
great
gesture
and
drew
a
deep
breath
on
the
continent
of
europe
said
he
as
if
even
a
particular
country
were
too
cabined
to
satisfy
his
nostalgia
for
wide
spaces
i
must
have
room
my
son
for
the
development
of
my
genius
i
must
dream
great
things
and
immortal
visions
are
blasted
under
the
basilisk
eye
of
lady
molyneux
she
is
a
i
cried
she
is
the
curse
of
england
said
paragot
after
this
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
take
more
note
of
melford
and
its
ways
than
i
had
done
hitherto
and
the
more
i
observed
it
the
less
did
it
appear
to
resemble
either
eden
or
the
boulevard
at
times
i
felt
dull
i
would
lean
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
at
the
other
end
of
the
high
street
and
watch
the
tower
and
decorated
spire
of
the
old
parish
church
rise
from
the
gold
and
russet
bosom
of
the
elms
and
wish
i
were
back
on
the
pont
neuf
with
the
tumultuous
life
of
paris
around
me
there
was
a
lack
of
breeziness
in
the
social
air
of
melford
meanwhile
paragot
and
joanna
continued
the
romance
of
long
ago
they
walked
together
in
the
garden
like
lovers
his
arm
around
her
waist
her
delicate
head
lightly
leaning
on
his
shoulder
once
when
i
made
my
presence
known
he
withdrew
his
arm
but
joanna
laughingly
replaced
it
what
does
it
matter
asticot
is
in
our
confidence
she
remarked
is
he
going
to
be
your
best
man
you
will
bring
him
over
for
the
wedding
gaston
you
cling
to
the
idea
of
being
married
in
melford
he
asked
of
course
by
that
dry
gentleman
who
treats
me
as
if
i
were
a
youth
he
would
like
to
prepare
for
confirmation
and
all
these
dreadful
people
to
look
on
my
dear
does
the
thought
of
it
chill
you
into
the
corpse
of
a
melfordian
i
should
have
imagined
that
so
long
as
we
were
married
the
would
not
matter
to
you
quite
so
said
he
why
does
the
matter
so
much
to
you
it
is
different
said
joanna
it
is
right
for
me
to
be
married
here
we
must
do
what
is
right
at
all
costs
assented
my
master
in
an
ironical
note
which
she
was
quick
to
detect
she
swerved
from
his
encircling
arm
you
would
not
be
married
under
a
bush
like
a
beggar
she
quoted
i
wish
to
heaven
i
could
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
spirit
it
is
the
only
way
of
mating
i
would
take
you
to
a
little
village
i
know
of
in
the
vosges
overhanging
a
precipice
with
god
mountains
and
sky
above
us
and
not
a
schedule
of
regulations
for
human
conduct
within
thirty
miles
and
monsieur
le
maire
would
tie
his
tricolor
scarf
around
him
and
marry
us
and
we
would
go
away
arm
in
arm
and
the
overhead
would
ring
the
wedding
peal
and
there
would
be
just
you
and
i
and
the
universe
we
compromise
said
joanna
smiling
we
spend
our
honeymoon
in
your
village
in
the
vosges
after
we
are
well
and
duly
and
respectably
married
in
melford
do
you
think
i
am
reasonable
asticot
my
dear
joanna
said
paragot
you
have
infatuated
this
boy
to
such
an
extent
that
he
would
agree
with
you
in
anything
of
course
he
will
say
that
the
reverend
and
respectable
hawkfield
is
better
than
the
picturesque
monsieur
le
maire
and
that
a
wedding
cake
from
gunter
is
preferable
to
the
curdled
cheese
of
valdeauvau
he
would
perjure
his
little
soul
to
atoms
for
your
sake
i
thought
somebody
else
would
too
whispered
joanna
softly
paragot
yielded
as
he
looked
down
at
her
face
so
he
would
for
your
sake
he
would
go
through
hell
and
the
church
of
england
service
for
the
solemnization
of
matrimony
we
were
walking
round
and
round
the
broad
gravel
path
that
enclosed
the
tennis
lawn
land
was
cheap
in
the
days
when
the
georgian
houses
of
the
high
street
were
built
and
people
took
as
much
for
garden
purposes
as
they
desired
the
gardens
were
the
only
truly
spacious
things
in
melford
there
was
a
long
silence
the
lovers
seemed
to
have
forgotten
my
existence
presently
joanna
spoke
you
must
remember
that
i
am
still
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
and
look
at
the
religious
side
of
marriage
it
would
be
very
pretty
to
be
married
by
monsieur
le
maire
but
i
could
not
reconcile
it
to
my
conscience
so
when
you
speak
scoffingly
of
a
marriage
in
church
you
rather
hurt
me
gaston
you
must
forgive
me
said
he
humbly
i
am
a
happy
pagan
and
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
met
anyone
who
belonged
to
the
church
of
england
that
i
thought
the
institution
had
perished
of
inanition
why
you
went
with
me
to
church
last
sunday
so
i
did
said
he
but
i
thought
it
was
only
to
worship
the
great
british
god
respectability
joanna
sighed
and
turned
the
conversation
to
the
autumn
tints
and
other
impersonal
things
and
i
noticed
that
she
drew
paragot
arm
again
around
her
waist
as
if
to
reassure
herself
of
something
as
we
passed
by
the
porch
i
entered
the
house
but
loving
to
look
on
my
dear
lady
i
lingered
and
saw
her
hold
up
her
lips
he
bent
down
and
kissed
them
do
think
me
foolish
gaston
she
said
but
i
have
starved
for
love
for
thirteen
years
by
the
gesture
of
his
arm
and
the
working
of
his
features
i
saw
that
he
rhapsodised
in
reply
to
the
sentimental
youngster
who
looked
on
this
seemed
an
idyll
without
a
disturbing
breath
joanna
though
she
had
lost
the
gay
spontaneity
of
her
paris
holiday
smiled
none
the
less
adorably
on
paragot
and
myself
she
wore
a
little
air
of
defiant
pride
when
she
introduced
him
to
her
acquaintance
as
my
cousin
monsieur
de
nérac
which
was
very
pretty
to
behold
convention
forbade
the
announcement
of
their
engagement
at
so
early
a
stage
of
her
widowhood
but
anyone
of
rudimentary
intelligence
could
see
that
she
was
presenting
her
future
husband
few
women
can
hide
that
triumphant
sense
of
proprietorship
in
a
man
especially
if
they
have
at
the
same
time
to
hold
themselves
on
the
defensive
against
the
possible
fulminations
of
lady
molyneux
joanna
proclaimed
herself
a
champion
even
when
paragot
forgot
his
social
reformation
and
banged
his
fist
down
on
the
dinner
table
till
the
glasses
rang
again
with
a
great
de
dieu
her
glance
swept
the
company
as
if
to
defy
them
to
find
anything
uncommon
in
the
demeanour
of
her
guest
it
was
only
towards
the
end
of
my
stay
that
she
began
to
wince
and
paragot
save
on
occasion
of
outburst
went
through
the
and
the
social
routine
with
the
grave
but
contented
face
of
a
man
who
had
found
his
real
avocation
looking
back
on
these
idyllic
days
i
realise
the
greatness
of
in
his
domestic
habits
he
was
less
a
human
being
than
a
mechanical
toy
at
half
past
eight
every
morning
he
entered
the
at
half
past
nine
he
went
into
the
town
to
get
shaved
had
he
an
appointment
with
joanna
he
was
there
to
the
minute
he
clothed
himself
in
what
he
considered
were
orthodox
garments
he
even
folded
up
his
trousers
of
nights
he
limited
his
smoking
to
a
definite
number
of
cigarettes
consumed
at
fixed
hours
apparently
he
had
never
heard
of
the
reprehensible
habit
of
drinking
between
meals
if
he
only
went
to
church
to
worship
the
british
god
respectability
he
did
so
with
impeccable
unction
no
undertaker
listened
to
the
funeral
service
with
more
portentous
solemnity
than
paragot
exhibited
during
the
sermon
indeed
sitting
bolt
upright
in
the
pew
his
lined
brown
face
set
in
a
blank
expression
his
frock
coat
buttoned
tight
across
his
chest
his
hair
despite
the
barber
pains
struggling
in
vain
to
obey
the
rules
of
the
unaccustomed
parting
he
bore
considerable
resemblance
to
an
undertaker
in
moderate
circumstances
of
the
delectable
vagabond
in
velveteens
fiddling
wildly
to
capering
peasants
of
the
unkempt
dictator
of
the
café
delphine
roaring
his
judgments
on
art
and
philosophy
for
the
delectation
of
his
disciples
not
a
trace
remained
he
sang
the
hymns
it
was
a
pity
they
did
not
invite
him
to
go
round
with
the
plate
yet
the
signs
of
a
rebellious
spirit
continued
now
and
then
to
manifest
themselves
he
asked
me
one
day
with
a
groan
whether
he
was
condemned
to
a
daily
clean
collar
for
the
rest
of
his
life
another
day
he
seized
me
by
the
arm
as
we
were
lounging
on
the
porch
and
dragged
me
out
of
earshot
of
the
house
my
good
asticot
said
he
in
a
dramatic
whisper
if
i
do
talk
to
a
man
i
shall
go
mad
i
shall
dance
around
the
flower
beds
and
scream
i
have
a
yearning
to
converse
with
the
host
of
the
black
boar
a
fat
rabelaisian
scoundrel
who
has
piqued
my
imagination
and
besides
if
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
were
cast
into
my
throat
this
minute
they
would
find
it
quite
a
different
thing
from
nebuchadnezzar
ineffectual
bonfire
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
go
to
the
black
boar
said
i
he
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
calling
me
a
delphic
oracle
and
haled
me
from
the
premises
through
the
garden
gate
with
the
lightning
rapidity
of
the
familiar
paragot
master
said
i
as
we
hastened
down
the
high
street
the
black
boar
stood
at
the
other
end
by
the
bridge
if
you
want
a
man
to
talk
to
there
is
always
major
walters
paragot
threw
out
his
hand
he
is
a
man
in
that
he
is
brave
and
masculine
in
that
he
is
intelligent
he
is
naught
he
is
a
he
fires
off
rounds
of
stereotyped
conversation
at
the
rate
of
one
a
minute
which
is
funereal
i
also
have
the
misfortune
my
little
asticot
to
be
under
the
ban
of
major
walters
displeasure
your
british
military
man
is
prejudiced
against
anyone
who
is
not
cut
out
according
to
pattern
madame
de
verneuil
is
not
cut
out
according
to
pattern
said
i
maliciously
your
infant
eyes
have
noticed
it
too
but
i
my
son
am
gaston
de
nérac
a
vidame
of
gascony
de
dieu
et
il
aura
affaire
à
moi
ce
do
you
know
what
he
had
the
impertinence
to
ask
me
yesterday
what
settlements
i
proposed
to
make
on
madame
de
verneuil
settlements
asticot
he
spoke
as
trustee
whatever
that
may
be
under
her
husband
will
said
i
will
settle
my
love
and
my
genius
upon
her
and
thereby
insure
her
happiness
and
her
prosperity
besides
madame
de
verneuil
has
a
fortune
which
will
suffice
her
needs
and
of
which
i
will
not
touch
a
penny
i
smiled
for
i
could
see
paragot
in
his
grand
french
manner
one
hand
thrust
between
the
buttons
of
his
coat
and
the
other
waving
magnificently
as
he
proclaimed
himself
to
major
walters
i
explained
he
continued
in
terms
which
i
thought
might
reach
his
intelligence
that
i
only
had
to
resume
my
profession
and
my
financial
position
would
equal
that
of
madame
de
verneuil
sir
said
i
will
not
suffer
you
to
say
another
word
we
bowed
and
parted
enemies
wherefore
the
conversation
of
the
excellent
major
walters
does
not
appeal
to
me
as
attractive
at
the
time
i
thought
this
very
noble
of
paragot
in
a
way
it
was
so
for
my
master
who
had
never
committed
a
dishonourable
action
in
his
life
was
genuine
in
his
scorn
of
the
insinuation
that
he
proposed
to
live
on
joanna
money
he
verily
believed
himself
capable
of
reattaining
fame
and
fortune
it
was
only
the
nuisance
of
having
to
do
so
that
at
introspective
times
disconcerted
him
he
knew
that
to
break
away
from
a
habit
of
idleness
would
need
considerable
effort
but
he
was
a
man
to
prove
it
he
called
for
a
quart
of
ale
in
the
of
the
black
boar
an
old
coaching
inn
set
back
from
the
road
the
little
eyes
of
the
fleshy
rubicond
host
loafing
comfortably
in
glistened
as
he
received
the
pantagruelian
order
and
brought
the
great
tankard
with
a
modest
half
pint
for
me
and
a
jorum
of
rum
for
himself
paragot
was
worthy
of
a
host
attention
paragot
pledged
him
and
literally
poured
the
contents
of
the
tankard
down
his
throat
the
landlord
stared
in
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
well
i
damned
said
he
i
take
another
said
paragot
the
landlord
brought
another
tankard
how
do
you
manage
it
he
asked
paragot
explained
that
he
had
learned
the
art
in
germany
you
open
your
throat
to
the
good
beer
without
moving
the
muscles
whereby
you
swallow
and
down
it
goes
well
i
jiggered
said
mine
host
have
you
no
pretty
drinkers
hereabouts
asked
my
master
sipping
the
second
quart
they
lots
of
comes
here
and
gets
fuddled
if
that
what
you
mean
paragot
waved
an
impatient
hand
to
get
fuddled
on
beer
is
not
pretty
drinking
have
you
any
topers
who
are
famous
in
the
neighborhood
men
who
can
carry
their
liquor
like
gentlemen
and
whose
souls
expand
as
they
get
more
and
more
filled
with
the
alcohol
of
human
kindness
if
so
i
should
like
to
meet
them
there
is
any
as
could
toss
off
a
quart
like
that
have
you
always
lived
in
melford
oh
no
replied
the
landlord
as
if
resenting
the
suggestion
i
was
born
and
bred
in
devizes
it
must
be
a
devil
of
a
place
devizes
said
paragot
it
be
none
so
bad
assented
the
landlord
a
woman
voice
from
the
bar
summoned
him
away
paragot
pushed
his
unfinished
quart
from
him
and
rose
he
shook
his
head
sadly
i
am
disappointed
in
that
man
he
is
a
mere
bucolic
idiot
i
shall
waste
my
talents
intellectual
and
bibulous
on
him
no
longer
our
excursion
into
the
bohemia
of
melford
is
a
failure
my
little
asticot
and
the
beer
is
confoundedly
sour
i
am
glad
i
did
not
vagabondise
in
rural
england
why
i
asked
to
avoid
an
asylum
for
idiots
i
should
have
rushed
into
the
dissenting
ministry
i
might
have
expected
mine
host
to
be
a
dullard
in
this
country
the
expected
always
happens
which
paralyses
the
brain
now
let
us
go
home
to
lunch
he
paid
the
bill
and
as
we
issued
from
the
door
of
the
inn
we
fell
into
the
arms
of
joanna
and
major
walters
the
latter
regarded
us
superciliously
and
joanna
catching
his
glance
flushed
to
the
wavy
hair
over
her
forehead
the
ordinary
greetings
having
been
exchanged
she
proudly
and
markedly
drew
paragot
ahead
leaving
me
to
follow
with
major
walters
as
he
made
no
remark
of
any
kind
during
our
little
walk
i
did
not
find
him
an
exhilarating
companion
chapter
xx
i
had
worked
till
the
last
glimmer
of
daylight
at
the
portrait
which
was
now
approaching
completion
that
the
end
of
it
for
said
i
laying
my
palette
and
brushes
aside
and
regarding
the
picture
joanna
rose
from
her
chair
by
the
fire
where
she
had
been
sewing
for
the
last
hour
and
stood
by
my
side
the
which
had
a
clear
light
through
the
french
window
leading
into
the
garden
had
been
assigned
to
me
as
a
studio
and
here
sometimes
on
a
murky
afternoon
joanna
who
preferred
the
bright
place
to
the
gloomy
honoured
me
with
her
company
rushworth
was
asleep
upstairs
and
paragot
had
gone
for
a
solitary
walk
we
were
cosily
alone
it
pleased
my
lady
to
be
flattering
it
is
wonderful
how
a
boy
like
you
can
do
such
work
for
you
a
boy
asticot
she
said
with
one
of
her
bright
smiles
in
a
few
years
you
will
have
the
world
at
your
feet
imploring
you
to
paint
its
portrait
you
will
fulfil
the
promise
wo
you
what
promise
madame
i
asked
the
promise
of
your
life
now
it
is
not
everyone
who
does
you
allow
outside
things
to
send
you
away
from
it
all
she
had
slung
the
stole
which
she
was
embroidering
for
the
vicar
across
her
shoulders
and
holding
the
two
ends
looked
at
me
wistfully
i
owe
it
to
my
master
madame
said
i
to
work
with
all
my
might
if
only
he
had
had
a
master
in
the
old
days
she
sighed
he
would
have
been
by
now
a
famous
man
full
of
honours
with
all
the
world
can
give
in
his
possession
has
he
the
best
the
world
can
give
now
that
he
has
found
you
again
said
i
somewhat
shyly
joanna
gave
a
short
laugh
you
talk
sometimes
like
one
grandfather
i
suppose
that
is
because
you
became
a
student
of
philosophy
at
a
tender
age
yes
your
master
has
found
me
again
but
after
all
what
is
a
woman
just
a
speck
of
dust
on
top
of
the
world
she
half
seated
herself
on
my
painting
stool
her
back
to
the
picture
tell
me
asticot
is
he
at
least
happy
can
you
doubt
it
madame
i
cried
warmly
i
do
so
want
him
to
be
happy
asticot
you
see
it
was
all
through
me
that
he
gave
up
his
career
and
took
to
the
strange
life
he
has
been
leading
and
i
feel
doubly
responsible
for
his
future
can
you
understand
that
her
blue
eyes
were
very
childish
and
earnest
for
all
my
love
of
paragot
i
suddenly
felt
something
like
pity
for
her
as
for
one
who
had
undertaken
a
responsibility
that
weighed
too
heavily
on
slender
shoulders
for
the
first
time
it
struck
me
that
paragot
and
joanna
might
not
be
a
perfectly
matched
couple
intuition
prompted
me
to
say
my
master
is
utterly
happy
but
you
must
give
him
a
little
time
to
accustom
himself
to
the
new
order
of
things
that
it
she
said
then
there
was
a
pause
you
are
such
a
wise
boy
she
continued
that
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
do
something
for
me
i
ca
do
it
myself
and
it
horrid
of
me
to
talk
about
it
but
do
you
think
you
might
suggest
to
him
that
people
of
our
class
do
visit
the
black
boar
i
do
mind
it
a
bit
but
other
people
my
cousin
major
walters
said
something
a
day
or
two
ago
and
it
hurt
they
understand
gaston
continental
ways
it
is
natural
for
a
man
to
go
to
a
café
in
france
but
in
england
things
are
so
different
i
promised
to
convey
to
paragot
the
tabu
of
the
black
boar
and
then
i
asked
her
which
she
preferred
england
or
france
she
shivered
and
a
gleam
of
frost
returned
to
her
eyes
i
never
want
to
see
france
again
i
was
so
unhappy
there
i
am
trying
to
persuade
de
nérac
to
live
in
london
he
can
find
as
much
scope
for
his
art
there
as
in
paris
ca
he
surely
said
i
and
you
come
too
she
said
with
the
flash
of
gaiety
that
was
one
of
her
charms
you
have
a
beautiful
studio
near
by
and
we
all
be
happy
together
she
jumped
off
the
painting
stool
and
having
bidden
me
light
the
gas
resumed
her
task
of
embroidering
the
stole
by
the
fireside
it
pretty
is
it
she
asked
holding
it
up
for
my
inspection
i
agreed
she
had
considerable
talent
for
art
needlework
gaston
does
appreciate
it
she
remarked
laughing
he
disapproves
of
clergymen
they
have
scarcely
been
in
his
line
i
answered
apologetically
they
will
have
to
be
oh
you
see
i
make
him
a
model
englishman
before
very
long
i
afraid
you
will
find
it
rather
difficult
madame
said
i
do
you
think
i
afraid
of
difficulties
is
everything
difficult
is
it
easy
for
you
to
get
everything
to
come
out
on
that
canvas
just
as
you
want
it
if
you
could
dash
it
off
in
a
minute
it
would
be
worth
doing
as
you
yourself
said
i
have
to
give
gaston
time
i
seated
myself
on
the
close
by
her
chair
and
for
some
minutes
watched
the
clever
needle
work
its
golden
way
through
the
white
silk
no
one
has
ever
had
such
dainty
fingers
and
delicate
wrists
you
must
think
because
i
have
spoken
about
de
nérac
that
i
am
discontented
i
would
have
him
a
bit
altered
integrally
for
there
is
no
one
like
him
living
and
i
utterly
happy
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
great
romance
of
my
life
is
it
wonderful
asticot
have
you
ever
heard
the
like
outside
a
story
book
to
meet
again
after
thirteen
years
and
to
find
the
old
the
old
love
i
whispered
as
i
saw
that
she
suddenly
blushed
at
the
word
as
strong
and
true
as
ever
it
is
the
inner
things
that
matter
asticot
the
outside
ones
are
nothing
dreadful
things
have
happened
to
each
of
us
during
those
years
but
they
have
clouded
the
serenity
of
our
souls
ah
madame
said
i
with
a
smile
it
strikes
me
now
that
i
was
slightly
impertinent
i
am
sure
my
master
said
that
yes
she
admitted
raising
wide
innocent
eyes
how
did
you
guess
you
yourself
once
detected
echoes
in
me
we
both
laughed
that
is
what
brought
us
together
asticot
you
seemed
to
regard
him
as
a
god
rather
than
as
a
man
and
i
loved
you
for
it
she
put
out
her
left
hand
i
touched
it
with
my
lips
that
a
charming
french
way
we
have
got
in
england
and
you
did
it
very
nicely
asticot
i
almost
scowled
at
the
servant
who
entered
with
the
announcement
that
tea
was
waiting
in
the
i
think
of
all
human
utterances
i
have
heard
fall
from
the
lips
of
those
i
love
and
honour
that
formula
of
paragot
echoed
by
joanna
was
the
most
pathetically
vain
and
they
believed
it
indeed
it
was
the
vital
article
of
their
faith
on
its
truth
the
whole
fabric
of
their
love
depended
it
counted
for
nothing
in
joanna
romantic
eyes
that
the
brilliant
eager
youth
rich
in
the
glory
of
his
who
had
won
her
heart
long
ago
she
shewed
me
his
photograph
alas
poor
paragot
was
now
the
spectre
the
tale
of
whose
ungentle
past
was
scarred
upon
his
face
who
stalked
grotesquely
comfortless
in
his
clothes
who
with
the
art
of
dress
had
lost
in
the
of
europe
the
graces
of
social
intercourse
it
counted
for
nothing
that
he
was
deserted
forever
by
the
elusive
wanton
inspiration
condemned
she
knew
it
in
her
heart
to
artistic
barrenness
in
perpetuity
it
counted
for
nothing
that
her
gods
awakened
his
contempt
and
his
gods
her
fear
it
counted
for
nothing
that
they
had
scarcely
a
single
taste
or
thought
in
common
boy
that
i
was
i
vow
i
entered
a
sweeter
chamber
of
intimacy
in
my
dear
heart
than
was
open
to
paragot
you
see
in
spite
of
all
the
deadening
influences
all
the
horror
of
her
married
life
she
had
remained
a
child
when
the
comte
de
verneuil
had
found
her
unforgiving
in
the
matter
of
the
false
announcement
of
paragot
death
he
had
left
her
pretty
much
to
herself
and
had
gone
after
the
strange
goddesses
the
ignoble
astaroths
beloved
by
a
man
of
his
type
month
had
followed
month
and
year
had
followed
year
and
she
had
not
developed
his
family
nationalist
and
devout
of
the
old
school
regarded
him
rightly
as
a
renegade
from
their
traditions
and
regarded
joanna
wrongly
as
the
english
heretic
who
had
seduced
him
from
the
paths
of
orthodoxy
their
relations
with
joanna
were
of
the
most
frigid
on
the
other
hand
the
society
of
hebraic
finance
in
which
the
comte
de
verneuil
found
profit
and
entertainment
was
repugnant
to
the
delicately
nurtured
englishwoman
she
led
a
lonely
existence
i
have
so
few
friends
in
paris
were
almost
her
first
words
to
me
on
the
day
of
our
meeting
outside
the
hôtel
bristol
she
went
through
the
world
her
lips
set
in
a
smile
and
her
dear
eyes
frozen
and
her
heart
yearning
for
the
sheltered
english
life
with
its
rules
for
guidance
and
its
barriers
of
convention
its
pleasant
little
routine
of
duties
and
its
gentle
communion
of
unemotional
temperaments
her
eleven
years
married
life
had
been
merely
a
suspension
of
existence
her
few
excursions
into
the
unusual
had
been
the
scared
adventures
of
a
child
her
romance
was
the
romance
of
a
child
her
gracious
simplicity
and
her
caressing
adorableness
which
made
my
boy
love
for
her
a
passionate
worship
which
has
lasted
to
this
day
when
we
both
are
old
and
only
meet
to
shake
heads
together
in
palsied
sympathy
were
the
essential
charms
of
a
child
how
should
she
understand
the
paragot
that
i
knew
his
soul
still
shone
the
stainless
radiance
that
had
dazzled
her
young
eyes
that
was
all
that
mattered
it
was
easy
to
convert
the
outer
man
to
convention
it
was
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
to
make
the
chartered
libertine
of
talk
accept
the
index
expurgatorius
of
subjects
mete
for
discussion
to
regulate
the
innate
vagabond
by
the
clock
to
bring
the
pantheistic
pagan
of
wide
spiritual
sympathies
for
paragot
was
by
no
means
an
irreligious
man
into
the
narrowest
sphere
of
anglicanism
the
colossal
nature
of
her
task
did
not
occur
to
her
and
there
again
she
exhibited
a
child
unreasoning
confidence
nor
did
it
occur
to
her
to
bid
him
throw
off
his
undertaker
garb
and
gloom
and
to
adopt
his
free
theories
of
life
and
conduct
at
her
mother
knee
she
had
learned
the
first
commandment
thou
shalt
have
none
other
gods
but
me
and
joanna
god
though
serving
her
sweet
innocent
soul
all
the
reasonable
purposes
of
a
deity
was
matthew
arnold
gigantic
clergyman
in
a
white
tie
in
obedience
to
his
maxims
alone
lay
salvation
joanna
conviction
was
unshakable
as
a
matter
of
course
paragot
must
walk
the
same
path
there
was
not
another
one
to
walk
paragot
accepted
meekly
my
report
of
joanna
tabu
of
the
black
boar
whatever
madame
de
verneuil
says
is
right
i
was
forgetting
that
the
refrain
of
the
ballade
of
the
immortal
villon
aux
tavernes
et
aux
which
was
that
of
my
life
for
so
many
years
is
so
no
longer
i
wonder
what
the
devil
the
refrain
is
now
ha
he
exclaimed
clapping
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
in
his
old
violent
way
i
have
it
also
villon
guess
did
i
teach
you
all
the
ballades
by
rote
as
we
wandered
through
savoy
yes
master
said
i
but
i
could
only
think
of
the
one
that
came
into
my
byronic
little
head
on
the
occasion
of
my
first
meeting
with
joanna
heureux
qui
rien
which
in
the
present
circumstances
was
clearly
not
applicable
the
romantic
lover
does
not
base
his
conduct
on
the
formula
that
blessed
is
he
who
has
nothing
to
do
with
women
what
is
it
master
i
asked
ceste
foy
je
veuil
vivre
et
i
did
not
understand
in
which
faith
do
you
wish
to
live
and
die
i
asked
he
made
a
gesture
of
disappointment
he
too
was
a
child
in
many
respects
you
must
go
back
to
paris
to
sharpen
your
wits
my
son
i
thought
i
had
trained
you
to
catch
allusion
one
of
the
most
delicate
and
satisfying
arts
of
life
did
i
not
preface
my
remarks
by
saying
that
madame
de
verneuil
was
infallible
by
which
i
mean
that
she
is
the
mouthpiece
of
all
the
sweeter
kinds
of
angels
that
is
the
faith
my
little
asticot
and
he
repeated
to
himself
the
rascal
poet
refrain
to
his
most
perfect
poem
ceste
foy
je
veuil
vivre
et
but
that
said
i
wishing
to
prove
that
i
had
not
forgotten
my
scholarship
is
a
prayer
to
our
lady
made
by
villon
at
the
request
of
his
mother
you
are
as
hopeless
as
mine
host
of
the
black
boar
said
my
master
and
being
wound
up
to
talk
it
was
during
the
interval
before
joining
the
ladies
he
launched
into
a
half
hour
disquisition
on
the
philosophic
value
of
allusiveness
addressing
me
as
if
i
had
been
his
audience
at
the
lotus
club
or
a
choice
band
of
disciples
at
the
café
delphine
in
the
i
played
my
piquet
with
rushworth
while
paragot
sat
with
joanna
in
a
far
corner
i
could
not
help
noticing
how
little
they
spoke
paragot
torrent
of
words
had
dried
up
and
the
talk
seemed
to
flow
in
unsatisfying
driblets
why
did
he
not
entertain
her
with
his
newly
adopted
romantical
motto
from
villon
why
did
he
not
express
in
terms
of
which
he
was
such
a
master
his
fantastic
adoration
why
even
did
he
not
continue
his
disquisition
on
the
philosophic
value
of
allusiveness
anything
thought
i
as
i
declared
a
and
fourteen
kings
rather
than
this
staccato
exchange
of
commonplaces
which
i
was
sure
neither
joanna
nor
himself
in
the
least
enjoyed
in
fact
my
dear
joanna
yawned
presently
major
walters
was
announced
he
had
come
he
explained
apologetically
on
trustee
business
and
required
joanna
signature
to
an
important
document
she
flew
to
him
with
a
pretty
air
of
delight
drew
him
by
the
arm
to
an
escritoire
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
laughed
girlishly
as
she
inked
her
fingers
and
confessed
her
powerlessness
to
comprehend
the
deed
she
was
signing
paragot
after
a
very
cold
exchange
of
greetings
with
major
walters
sat
down
by
our
and
watched
the
game
with
the
funereal
expression
he
always
wore
when
he
desired
to
exhibit
his
entire
correctness
of
demeanour
to
rushworth
placid
remarks
during
the
deals
he
made
the
politest
of
monosyllabic
replies
meanwhile
his
dingy
white
tie
which
he
never
could
arrange
properly
he
dressed
for
dinner
each
night
without
a
murmur
had
worked
up
beyond
his
collar
and
encircling
his
lean
neck
like
a
ribbon
gave
him
a
peculiarly
unheroic
appearance
the
signing
over
joanna
kept
major
walters
by
the
escritoire
and
chatted
in
a
lively
manner
as
far
as
i
could
hear
and
i
am
afraid
my
attention
was
sadly
abstracted
from
my
game
they
talked
of
the
same
unintelligible
things
as
the
tuesday
afternoon
guests
personalities
local
doings
and
what
not
she
ran
to
fetch
the
stole
over
which
paragot
had
not
glowed
with
rapturous
enthusiasm
apparently
major
walters
said
just
the
thing
concerning
it
her
heart
craved
to
hear
her
silvery
voice
rippled
with
pleasure
a
while
later
he
must
have
returned
to
some
business
matter
which
he
declared
settled
for
she
put
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
in
her
impulsive
caressing
way
and
her
eyes
beamed
gratitude
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
you
dennis
you
bear
all
my
responsibilities
on
your
strong
shoulders
how
can
i
thank
you
he
bent
down
and
said
something
in
a
low
voice
at
which
she
blushed
and
laughed
reprovingly
his
remark
did
not
offend
her
in
the
least
she
was
enjoying
herself
he
drew
himself
up
with
a
smile
it
was
then
that
i
noted
particularly
how
well
bred
and
he
was
how
easily
his
clothes
fitted
it
seemed
as
impossible
for
major
walters
tie
to
work
up
round
his
neck
as
for
his
toes
to
protrude
through
his
boots
he
gave
one
the
impression
of
having
followed
cleanliness
of
thought
and
person
all
his
life
i
began
to
have
a
sneaking
admiration
for
the
man
i
beheld
in
its
openness
that
which
i
had
often
seen
pierce
through
paragot
travesty
of
mountebankery
or
rags
but
which
singularly
enough
seemed
hidden
beneath
his
conventional
garb
the
inborn
and
incommunicable
quality
of
the
gentleman
i
set
to
dreaming
of
it
and
scheming
out
a
portrait
in
which
that
essential
quality
could
be
expressed
whereby
i
played
the
fool
with
my
hand
and
incurred
the
mild
rebuke
of
my
adversary
as
she
repiqued
and
capoted
me
and
triumphantly
declared
the
game
there
was
a
short
general
conversation
then
major
walters
declining
the
offer
of
whisky
and
soda
in
the
took
his
leave
paragot
accompanied
him
to
the
front
door
when
he
returned
rushworth
retired
as
she
always
did
after
her
game
and
joanna
instead
of
remaining
with
us
for
an
hour
as
usual
pleaded
fatigue
and
went
to
bed
master
said
i
boyishly
full
of
my
new
idea
do
you
think
major
walters
would
sit
to
me
i
do
mean
as
a
commission
of
course
i
could
ask
him
but
for
practice
i
should
like
to
paint
him
as
a
knight
in
armour
why
this
lunatic
notion
asked
my
master
i
explained
he
looked
at
me
for
some
time
very
seriously
there
was
a
touch
of
pain
in
his
tired
blue
eyes
you
are
right
my
little
asticot
he
said
and
i
was
wrong
my
perception
is
growing
blunt
i
regarded
our
friend
as
having
fallen
out
of
the
war
office
box
of
tin
soldiers
your
vision
has
been
keener
breed
counts
for
much
but
for
it
to
have
full
value
there
must
be
the
as
well
all
the
same
the
notion
of
asking
major
walters
to
pose
to
you
in
a
suit
of
armour
is
lunatic
and
the
sooner
you
finish
rushworth
and
get
back
to
janot
the
better
there
is
also
blanquette
who
must
be
bored
to
death
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
with
no
one
but
narcisse
to
bear
her
company
he
put
a
cigarette
into
his
mouth
but
for
some
time
did
not
light
it
although
he
held
a
match
ready
to
strike
in
his
fingers
his
thoughts
held
him
my
son
he
said
at
last
i
would
give
the
eyes
out
of
my
head
to
have
my
violin
why
master
i
asked
because
said
he
when
one
is
afflicted
with
a
divine
despair
there
is
nothing
for
it
like
fiddling
it
out
of
the
system
chapter
xxi
paris
again
janot
the
organized
confusion
of
the
studio
the
boisterous
comradeship
of
my
coevals
the
monday
morning
throng
of
models
in
all
stages
of
crowding
the
staircases
the
noisy
café
over
the
way
the
restaurant
didier
where
those
of
us
young
men
and
maidens
who
had
princely
incomes
dined
marvellously
for
one
franc
fifty
such
wine
i
writhe
sympathetically
at
its
memory
the
squabbles
the
new
romances
the
new
slang
on
the
tip
of
everyone
tongue
the
studio
in
menilmontant
where
the
four
of
us
slaved
at
masterpieces
the
dear
inspiring
life
again
paris
too
which
meant
the
rue
des
saladiers
and
blanquette
and
narcisse
and
the
grace
of
dear
familiar
things
it
must
not
be
counted
to
me
for
ingratitude
that
i
was
glad
to
be
back
i
was
still
a
boy
under
twenty
my
pockets
bulged
with
the
bank
notes
into
which
i
had
converted
rushworth
cheque
and
i
found
myself
master
of
infinite
delight
i
presented
blanquette
with
a
comb
and
narcisse
with
a
collar
and
i
electrified
my
intimate
and
less
fortunate
friends
by
giving
them
a
dinner
in
the
dismal
entresol
at
didier
which
was
superbly
styled
the
des
fanchette
and
one
or
two
of
her
colleagues
being
of
the
party
i
fear
we
behaved
in
a
disreputable
manner
if
melford
had
looked
on
it
would
have
blushed
to
the
top
of
its
decorated
spire
we
put
the
table
aside
and
danced
eccentric
quadrilles
we
shouted
roystering
songs
when
cazalet
tried
to
sing
a
solo
we
held
him
down
and
gagged
him
with
his
own
sandals
we
flirted
in
corners
a
goodly
portion
of
rosaria
a
spanish
model
born
and
bred
in
the
quartier
we
washed
in
red
wine
it
was
a
memorable
evening
the
next
day
blanquette
listened
with
great
interest
to
my
expurgated
account
of
the
proceedings
and
in
her
good
unhumorous
way
prescribed
for
my
headache
when
one
is
young
such
a
night
is
worth
a
headache
i
am
unrepentant
even
though
i
am
old
and
the
almond
tree
flourishes
and
the
grasshopper
is
trying
to
be
a
nuisance
i
do
like
your
oldsters
who
pretend
to
be
ashamed
of
the
follies
of
their
youth
they
are
humbugs
all
there
is
no
respectable
elderly
gentleman
in
the
land
who
does
not
inwardly
chuckle
over
the
chimes
he
has
heard
at
midnight
though
i
always
had
joanna
gracious
personality
at
the
back
of
my
mind
and
the
love
of
my
good
master
as
part
of
my
spiritual
equipment
yet
i
must
confess
to
concerning
my
thoughts
very
little
with
the
progress
of
their
romance
i
took
it
for
granted
as
i
took
many
things
in
those
unspeculative
days
the
actual
whirl
of
paris
caught
me
and
left
me
little
time
for
conjecture
i
wrote
once
or
twice
to
joanna
but
my
letters
were
egotistical
outpourings
the
mythological
picture
at
menilmontant
inspired
sheets
of
excited
verbiage
she
replied
in
her
pretty
sympathetic
way
but
gave
me
little
news
of
paragot
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
she
should
write
romantically
like
a
young
girl
foolishly
in
love
gushing
to
a
bosom
friend
paragot
himself
who
disliked
pen
ink
and
paper
merely
sent
me
the
casual
messages
of
affection
through
joanna
he
took
the
view
of
the
duenna
in
ruy
blas
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
king
epistle
to
the
queen
madame
it
is
very
windy
and
i
have
killed
six
wolves
carlos
what
more
was
necessary
asked
the
duenna
so
did
paragot
when
i
was
with
blanquette
i
avoided
the
subject
of
the
impending
marriage
as
much
as
possible
she
looked
forward
with
dull
fatalism
to
the
day
when
another
woman
would
take
the
master
into
her
keeping
and
her
own
occupation
would
be
gone
but
blanquette
we
shall
go
on
living
together
just
as
we
are
doing
now
i
cried
in
the
generosity
of
youth
and
when
a
woman
comes
and
takes
you
too
i
swore
insane
vows
of
celibacy
but
she
laughed
at
me
in
her
way
and
uttered
blunt
truths
concerning
the
weaknesses
of
my
sex
besides
my
little
asticot
she
added
i
love
you
very
much
you
know
that
well
but
you
are
not
the
master
once
i
suggested
the
possibility
of
her
marrying
some
one
else
there
was
a
cheerful
at
the
corner
of
the
street
who
to
my
knowledge
paid
her
assiduous
attentions
he
was
evidently
a
man
of
substance
and
refinement
for
a
zinc
bath
was
prominently
displayed
among
his
hardware
but
blanquette
love
laughed
at
tinsmiths
she
who
had
lived
on
equal
terms
with
the
master
and
myself
i
bowed
my
acknowledgment
of
the
tribute
to
marry
a
person
without
education
mais
non
au
grand
nom
merci
she
was
as
scornful
as
you
please
and
without
rhyme
or
reason
plucked
a
bunch
of
christmas
roses
from
a
jug
on
the
table
and
threw
them
into
the
stove
poor
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
fich
à
to
chuck
herself
into
the
river
that
was
the
end
of
most
of
our
conversations
on
the
disastrous
subject
it
was
the
end
of
a
talk
on
one
november
evening
about
three
weeks
after
i
had
returned
to
paris
i
had
dined
at
home
with
blanquette
and
was
in
the
midst
of
a
drawing
which
i
blush
to
say
i
was
doing
for
fou
an
unprincipled
comic
paper
fortunately
long
since
defunct
fortunately
tartuffe
that
i
am
many
a
welcome
louis
did
i
get
from
it
in
those
necessitous
days
when
she
looked
up
from
her
sewing
and
asked
when
the
master
was
coming
back
the
question
led
to
an
answer
the
answer
to
an
observation
and
the
observation
to
the
discussion
of
the
subject
there
is
no
way
out
of
it
pauvre
asticot
je
vais
me
fich
à
comme
je
in
the
meanwhile
my
dear
said
i
throwing
down
the
pen
and
pushing
my
drawing
away
if
you
remain
in
this
pestilential
condition
of
morbidness
you
will
die
without
the
necessity
of
drowning
yourself
instead
of
making
ourselves
miserable
let
us
go
and
dance
at
the
bal
jasmin
this
evening
she
asked
startled
she
had
never
grown
accustomed
to
the
suddenness
of
the
artistic
temperament
of
course
this
evening
you
do
suppose
i
would
ask
you
to
dance
next
month
so
as
to
cure
you
of
indigestion
but
nothing
is
wrong
with
my
stomach
said
the
literal
blanquette
it
is
indigestion
of
the
heart
said
i
after
the
manner
of
paragot
and
dancing
with
me
at
the
bal
jasmin
will
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
you
it
would
give
you
pleasure
this
was
charmingly
said
it
implied
that
she
would
sacrifice
her
feelings
for
my
sake
but
her
eyes
brightened
and
her
cheeks
flushed
a
little
women
are
rank
hypocrites
on
occasion
ten
minutes
later
blanquette
wearing
her
black
sunday
gown
set
off
by
a
blue
silk
scarf
embroidered
at
the
edges
with
a
curious
kind
of
pink
her
hair
tidily
coiled
on
top
and
fixed
with
my
comb
announced
that
she
was
ready
we
started
in
those
days
i
did
not
drive
to
balls
in
luxurious
hired
vehicles
i
walked
pipe
in
mouth
correctly
giving
my
arm
to
blanquette
no
doubt
everybody
thought
us
lovers
it
is
odd
how
wrong
everybody
can
be
sometimes
the
bal
jasmin
was
situated
in
the
rue
mouffetard
it
has
long
since
disappeared
with
many
a
haunt
of
my
youth
revelry
the
tide
of
frolic
has
set
northward
and
montmartre
which
to
us
was
but
a
geographical
term
now
dazzles
the
world
with
its
venal
splendour
but
the
moulin
de
la
galette
and
the
bal
tabarin
of
the
present
day
lack
the
gaiety
of
the
bal
jasmin
it
was
not
well
frequented
it
gathered
round
its
people
with
shocking
reputations
the
sight
of
a
man
in
a
dress
coat
would
have
transfixed
the
assembly
like
some
ghost
the
ladies
would
have
huddled
together
in
a
circle
round
the
wearer
and
gazed
at
him
he
would
subsequently
have
had
to
pay
for
the
ball
liquid
refreshment
the
bal
jasmin
did
not
employ
meretricious
ornament
to
attract
custom
a
low
gallery
containing
tables
ran
around
the
bare
hall
the
balustrade
being
of
convenient
elbow
height
from
the
floor
so
that
the
dancers
during
intervals
of
rest
could
lounge
and
talk
with
the
drinkers
in
the
middle
was
a
circular
bandstand
where
greasy
musicians
fiddled
with
perspiring
zeal
at
the
doors
a
sergent
de
ville
stood
and
nodded
to
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
with
whom
he
had
a
professional
acquaintance
everybody
came
to
dance
if
good
fortune
such
as
a
watch
or
a
freshly
subventioned
student
fell
into
their
mouths
they
swallowed
it
like
honest
sensible
souls
but
they
did
not
make
reprehensible
adventure
the
main
object
of
their
evening
they
danced
the
quadrilles
not
for
payment
and
the
delectation
of
foreigners
as
at
the
jardin
de
paris
but
for
their
own
pleasure
a
girl
kicked
off
your
hat
out
of
sheer
kindness
of
heart
and
animal
spirits
and
if
you
waltzed
with
her
she
danced
with
her
strange
little
soul
throbbing
in
her
feet
there
were
i
say
the
most
dreadfully
shocking
people
at
the
bal
jasmin
but
they
could
teach
the
irreproachable
a
lesson
in
the
art
of
enjoyment
as
i
came
with
blanquette
and
danced
only
with
blanquette
and
sat
with
blanquette
over
bock
or
syrup
in
the
gallery
the
unwritten
etiquette
of
the
place
caused
us
to
be
undisturbed
like
the
rest
of
the
assembly
we
enjoyed
ourselves
dancing
was
blanquette
one
supreme
accomplishment
old
père
paragot
had
taught
her
to
play
the
zither
indifferently
well
but
he
had
made
her
dance
divinely
and
blanquette
i
may
here
mention
incidentally
had
been
my
instructress
in
the
art
seeing
her
coarse
figure
and
holding
your
arm
around
her
solid
waist
as
you
waited
for
the
bar
you
would
not
have
dreamed
of
the
fairy
lightness
it
assumed
the
moment
feet
moved
in
time
with
the
music
if
life
had
been
a
continuous
waltz
no
partner
of
hers
less
awkward
than
a
rhinoceros
could
have
avoided
falling
in
love
with
her
but
waltzes
ended
all
too
soon
and
the
sylph
of
a
woman
became
my
plain
homely
blanquette
uninspiring
of
romance
save
in
the
hardware
bosom
of
the
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
saladiers
the
was
crowded
gaunt
men
each
a
parody
of
one
of
the
seven
deadly
sins
capered
grotesquely
with
daughters
of
rahab
in
cheap
hats
and
feathers
shop
assistants
and
neat
students
picturesquely
and
floppily
trousered
and
cravated
and
poorly
clad
models
a
whole
army
of
nondescripts
heaven
knows
with
what
means
of
livelihood
all
dancing
drinking
eating
laughing
jesting
smoking
primitively
moving
shouting
a
phantasmagoria
of
souls
making
merry
beyond
the
pale
of
reputable
life
such
were
the
frequenters
of
the
bal
jasmin
gas
flared
in
two
concentric
circles
of
flame
around
the
hall
and
around
the
central
bandstand
there
was
no
ventilation
the
sweltered
in
perspiration
abjects
hawked
penny
paper
fans
between
the
dances
and
the
whole
room
was
blanquette
who
had
forgotten
tragedy
for
the
time
sat
with
me
at
a
table
by
the
balustrade
and
alternately
sipped
her
syrup
and
water
and
looked
full
of
interest
at
the
scene
below
now
and
then
clutching
my
arm
to
direct
my
attention
to
startling
personalities
the
light
in
her
eyes
and
the
colour
in
her
coarse
cheeks
made
her
almost
pretty
you
have
never
seen
ugliness
in
a
happy
face
and
blanquette
was
happy
do
you
want
to
go
and
dance
with
any
other
she
asked
generously
i
will
wait
for
you
here
i
declined
with
equal
magnanimity
to
leave
her
alone
suppose
some
rapscallion
came
up
and
asked
you
to
dance
i
can
take
care
of
myself
asticot
she
laughed
bracing
her
strong
arms
and
suppose
i
wanted
to
go
off
with
him
they
are
amusing
sometimes
people
like
that
there
is
one
ce
the
in
question
was
a
young
man
unwashed
and
collarless
wearing
the
peaked
cap
of
paris
villainy
he
crossed
the
hall
accompanied
by
two
of
the
brazenest
hussies
that
ever
emerged
from
the
shadow
of
the
fortifications
as
they
passed
the
sergent
de
ville
they
all
cocked
themselves
up
with
an
air
of
braggadocio
he
makes
me
shiver
said
blanquette
shrugged
her
shoulders
one
must
have
all
sorts
of
people
in
the
world
as
there
are
so
many
things
to
make
people
different
it
is
only
a
chance
that
i
have
not
become
like
those
girls
it
no
one
fault
but
by
the
grace
of
god
goes
john
bunyan
i
quoted
reflectively
you
are
developing
philosophy
blanquette
and
your
gentle
toleration
of
the
infamous
does
you
credit
but
only
the
master
would
get
what
was
infamous
out
of
them
the
band
struck
up
a
waltz
blanquette
drank
her
syrup
quickly
and
rose
come
and
dance
we
descended
and
soon
were
swept
along
in
the
whirl
of
ragamuffin
couples
dancing
every
step
in
the
tradition
of
paris
steering
was
no
easy
matter
after
a
while
we
were
hemmed
in
near
the
side
of
the
hall
and
were
just
on
the
point
of
emerging
from
the
crush
when
the
sound
of
a
voice
brought
us
to
a
dead
stop
which
caused
us
to
be
knocked
about
like
a
pair
of
footballs
my
good
monsieur
bubu
le
vainqueur
you
do
me
infinite
honour
but
until
i
have
devoured
the
proceeds
of
my
last
crime
i
lead
a
life
of
elegant
leisure
we
escaped
from
danger
and
reaching
the
side
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
in
stupefaction
blanquette
was
the
first
to
see
him
she
seized
my
arm
and
pointed
it
is
he
it
is
he
it
was
he
he
was
sitting
at
a
table
a
few
yards
off
and
his
companions
were
the
youth
and
the
two
girls
over
whom
blanquette
had
philosophised
he
wore
his
silk
hat
brandy
was
in
front
of
him
he
seemed
to
be
on
familiar
terms
with
his
friends
for
a
long
time
we
watched
him
fascinated
not
daring
to
accost
him
and
yet
unwilling
to
edge
away
out
of
his
sight
and
make
our
escape
from
the
ball
i
saw
that
he
was
incredibly
dirty
his
beard
of
some
days
growth
gave
him
a
peculiarly
grim
appearance
his
hat
had
rolled
in
the
mud
and
was
everything
a
silk
hat
ought
not
to
be
his
linen
was
black
never
had
the
garb
of
respectability
been
so
battered
into
the
vesture
of
disrepute
suddenly
he
caught
sight
of
us
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
waved
us
a
bland
unashamed
salutation
we
went
up
the
nearest
steps
to
the
gallery
and
waited
after
a
polite
he
bowed
to
his
companions
and
reeled
towards
us
i
knew
by
the
familiar
gait
that
he
had
had
many
cognacs
and
absinthes
during
the
day
but
what
in
the
name
of
sanity
was
he
doing
here
dieu
mon
dieu
fait
ici
asked
blanquette
i
shook
my
head
it
was
stupefying
bien
mes
you
have
come
to
amuse
yourselves
eh
i
too
in
the
company
of
my
excellent
friend
bubu
le
vainqueur
whose
acquaintance
together
with
that
of
his
fair
companions
i
would
not
advise
you
to
cultivate
but
master
i
gasped
what
has
happened
i
veil
it
my
son
said
he
laying
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
in
the
decent
obscurity
of
a
learned
language
reversus
ad
suum
vomitum
et
sus
lota
in
volutabro
mon
sighed
blanquette
again
as
if
it
were
something
too
appalling
but
why
master
i
entreated
why
wallow
why
not
and
now
my
little
blanquette
we
will
all
go
home
and
you
shall
make
me
some
good
coffee
or
do
you
want
to
stay
longer
and
dance
with
asticot
oh
let
us
go
away
master
said
blanquette
casting
a
scared
glance
at
bubu
le
vainqueur
who
was
watching
us
with
an
interested
air
said
paragot
blandly
the
dance
stopped
and
the
thirsty
crowd
surged
to
the
gallery
we
threaded
our
way
towards
the
door
and
i
thought
with
burning
cheeks
that
the
eyes
of
the
whole
assembly
were
turned
to
my
master
silk
hat
it
was
a
relief
to
escape
from
the
noise
and
of
the
which
had
suddenly
lost
its
glamour
into
the
cool
and
quiet
street
after
we
had
walked
a
few
yards
in
silence
he
hooked
his
arms
in
blanquette
and
mine
and
broke
into
a
loud
laugh
but
it
is
astonishing
the
age
of
you
children
you
might
be
fifty
each
of
you
and
i
your
little
boy
whom
you
had
discovered
in
an
act
of
naughtiness
and
were
bringing
home
really
are
you
as
displeased
with
me
ce
but
laugh
my
little
blanquette
are
you
not
glad
to
see
me
but
yes
master
said
blanquette
it
is
like
a
dream
and
you
asticot
of
my
heart
i
find
it
a
dream
too
i
ca
understand
when
did
you
leave
melford
about
five
days
ago
i
would
tell
you
the
day
of
the
week
if
i
had
the
habit
of
exactness
and
madame
de
verneuil
is
very
well
thank
you
after
this
rebuff
i
asked
no
more
questions
i
remarked
that
the
weather
was
still
cold
paragot
laughed
again
he
has
turned
into
a
nice
little
bourgeois
has
he
blanquette
he
knows
how
to
make
polite
conversation
he
is
tidy
in
his
habits
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
eh
he
does
not
spit
on
the
floor
or
spill
absinthe
over
the
counterpane
je
suis
un
vieux
salaud
hein
do
say
no
and
narcisse
it
is
he
who
will
be
contented
to
see
you
cried
blanquette
and
so
are
we
all
oui
en
effet
je
suis
contente
she
heaved
a
great
sigh
as
though
she
had
awakened
from
the
of
seeing
herself
a
dripping
corpse
in
the
morgue
it
is
no
longer
the
same
thing
when
you
are
not
in
the
house
truly
i
am
happy
master
you
ca
understand
there
was
a
little
throb
in
her
voice
which
paragot
seemed
to
notice
for
as
he
bent
down
to
her
his
grip
of
my
arm
relaxed
and
i
suppose
his
grip
of
hers
tightened
it
gives
you
such
pleasure
that
i
come
back
my
little
blanquette
he
said
tenderly
i
craned
my
head
forward
and
saw
her
raise
her
faithful
eyes
to
his
and
smile
as
she
pronounced
her
eternal
it
is
only
asticot
who
does
not
welcome
the
prodigal
father
i
protested
he
laughed
away
my
protestations
then
suddenly
he
stopped
and
drew
a
long
breath
and
gazed
at
the
tall
houses
whose
lines
cut
the
frosty
sky
into
a
straight
strip
ah
how
good
it
smells
how
good
it
is
to
be
in
paris
again
the
door
of
a
de
swung
open
just
by
our
noses
to
give
exit
to
a
reveller
and
the
hot
poisoned
air
streamed
forth
and
how
good
it
is
the
smell
of
alcohols
i
could
kiss
the
honest
sot
who
has
just
reeled
out
and
is
skating
across
the
road
bas
les
bourgeois
he
did
not
carry
out
his
unpleasing
desire
but
when
we
reached
the
salon
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
and
we
had
lit
the
lamp
he
kissed
blanquette
on
both
cheeks
still
crying
out
how
good
it
was
to
be
back
narcisse
mad
with
delight
capered
about
him
and
barked
his
rapture
he
did
not
in
the
least
mind
a
master
lapsed
from
grace
paragot
threw
himself
on
a
chair
his
hat
still
on
his
head
oh
how
dirty
dilapidated
and
unshaven
he
was
i
felt
too
miserable
with
apprehension
to
emulate
narcisse
enthusiasm
it
was
cold
i
opened
the
door
of
the
stove
to
let
the
glowing
heat
come
out
into
the
room
blanquette
went
to
the
kitchen
to
prepare
the
coffee
suddenly
paragot
leaped
to
his
feet
cast
his
silk
hat
on
the
floor
and
stamped
it
into
a
pancake
then
he
thrust
it
into
the
stove
and
shut
the
door
he
cried
before
i
could
interfere
he
had
taken
off
his
and
holding
one
skirt
in
his
hands
and
securing
the
other
with
his
foot
had
ripped
it
from
waist
to
neck
he
was
going
to
burn
this
also
when
i
stopped
him
said
he
impatiently
it
will
make
such
a
horrid
smell
master
said
i
he
threw
the
garment
across
the
room
with
a
laugh
it
is
true
he
stretched
himself
and
waved
his
arms
ah
now
i
am
better
now
i
am
paragot
berzélius
nibbidard
paragot
again
now
i
am
free
from
the
forms
and
symbols
yes
my
son
that
hat
has
been
to
me
luke
iron
crown
that
coat
has
been
the
forte
et
crushing
my
infinite
soul
into
my
liver
he
tore
off
his
black
tie
and
hurled
it
away
from
him
this
has
been
strangling
every
noble
inspiration
i
have
been
swathed
in
mummy
bands
of
convention
i
have
been
dead
i
have
come
to
life
my
lungs
are
full
my
soul
regains
its
limitless
horizons
my
swollen
tongue
is
cool
and
de
dieu
de
nom
de
i
can
talk
again
he
walked
up
and
down
the
little
salon
vociferating
his
freedom
and
kicking
the
remains
of
the
before
him
with
one
of
his
sudden
impulses
he
picked
it
up
and
threw
it
out
of
a
quickly
opened
window
the
sight
of
it
offended
me
he
explained
master
said
i
where
are
your
other
things
what
other
things
your
luggage
your
great
coat
your
umbrella
why
at
melford
said
he
with
an
air
of
surprise
where
else
should
they
be
i
had
thought
that
no
action
of
paragot
could
astonish
me
i
was
wrong
i
stared
at
him
as
stupefied
as
ever
usually
people
travel
with
their
luggage
said
i
foolishly
they
are
usual
people
my
son
i
am
not
one
of
them
it
came
to
a
point
when
i
must
either
expire
or
go
i
decided
not
to
expire
these
things
are
done
all
in
a
flash
i
was
walking
in
the
garden
it
was
last
sunday
afternoon
i
remember
now
a
sodden
november
day
imagine
a
sodden
november
sunday
afternoon
english
garden
joanna
was
at
a
children
service
ah
the
desolation
of
that
sunday
afternoon
the
my
son
that
was
in
the
air
ah
i
choked
i
struggled
the
the
leaden
sky
closed
in
upon
me
i
walked
out
i
came
back
to
paris
just
like
that
i
murmured
just
like
that
said
he
you
may
have
noticed
my
son
that
i
am
a
man
of
swift
decisions
and
prompt
action
i
walked
to
the
railway
station
a
providential
london
train
was
expected
in
five
minutes
i
took
it
did
you
stay
long
in
london
i
asked
by
way
of
saying
something
for
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
did
i
see
anything
worth
seeing
at
the
theatres
and
did
i
have
a
good
crossing
my
little
asticot
i
perceive
you
have
become
an
adept
at
conventional
conversation
if
you
ca
say
something
original
i
shall
go
back
to
bubu
le
vainqueur
whose
society
for
the
last
three
days
has
afforded
me
infinite
delectation
although
his
views
of
life
may
be
what
melford
would
call
depraved
at
any
rate
they
are
he
does
not
waste
his
time
in
futile
politeness
suddenly
he
paused
and
seized
me
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
me
as
he
had
often
done
before
creep
out
of
that
shell
of
gentility
you
little
he
cried
and
tell
me
how
you
would
like
to
live
in
melford
for
the
rest
of
your
natural
life
i
should
like
it
at
all
said
i
then
how
do
you
expect
me
to
have
liked
it
blanquette
entered
with
the
great
white
coffee
jug
and
some
thick
cups
and
set
the
tray
on
the
table
seeing
paragot
in
his
grubby
she
looked
around
with
her
housewifely
instinct
of
tidiness
for
the
discarded
garments
where
are
gone
he
shouted
waving
his
arms
cast
into
the
flames
and
rent
in
twain
and
scattered
to
the
winds
of
heaven
he
laughed
seeing
that
she
did
not
understand
and
poured
out
a
jorum
of
coffee
the
farcical
comedy
is
over
blanquette
said
he
gently
i
a
no
longer
do
you
see
we
are
going
to
live
just
as
we
did
before
you
went
away
in
the
summer
and
i
am
not
going
to
be
married
i
am
going
to
live
with
my
little
blanquette
for
ever
and
ever
sæculo
sæculorum
she
turned
as
white
as
the
coffee
jug
i
thought
she
was
about
to
faint
and
caught
her
in
my
arms
she
did
not
faint
but
burying
her
head
against
my
shoulder
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
what
the
devil
the
matter
asked
paragot
are
you
sorry
i
not
going
to
be
married
non
mais
non
blanquette
sobbed
out
vehemently
i
think
she
rather
glad
master
said
i
he
put
down
his
and
laid
his
hands
on
her
as
if
to
draw
her
comfortingly
away
from
me
my
dear
child
he
began
but
she
shrank
back
non
she
cried
and
bolted
from
the
room
paragot
looked
at
me
inquiringly
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
eternal
feminine
i
suppose
blanquette
like
the
rest
of
them
it
odd
you
have
noticed
it
before
master
noticed
what
i
lit
a
cigarette
the
eternal
feminine
in
blanquette
i
answered
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
she
was
jealous
even
of
my
friendship
with
madame
de
verneuil
said
i
diplomatically
realising
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
betraying
blanquette
confidences
it
never
struck
me
that
she
was
jealous
he
remarked
simply
he
took
his
to
the
rickety
sofa
and
sat
down
with
the
sigh
of
a
tired
man
i
took
mine
to
the
chair
by
the
stove
and
we
drank
silently
i
have
never
felt
so
hopelessly
miserable
in
my
life
as
i
did
that
night
i
was
old
enough
or
perhaps
rather
i
had
gathered
experience
enough
to
feel
a
shock
of
disgust
at
paragot
return
volutabro
in
what
sordid
den
had
he
found
shelter
these
last
days
of
reaction
i
shuddered
and
loving
him
i
hated
myself
for
shuddering
yet
i
understood
he
was
a
man
of
extremes
having
fled
from
the
intolerable
virtues
of
melford
with
the
nostalgia
of
the
vagabond
life
devouring
him
like
a
flame
he
could
not
have
been
expected
to
return
tamely
to
the
rue
des
saladiers
he
had
plunged
head
foremost
into
the
depths
but
bubu
le
vainqueur
the
latin
quarter
was
not
exactly
a
sunday
school
very
probably
it
flirted
with
bubu
lady
companions
but
between
bubu
and
itself
it
raised
an
impassable
barrier
the
idyll
too
was
over
he
had
left
my
dear
lady
joanna
without
drum
or
trumpet
as
my
destiny
hung
with
his
i
should
never
behold
her
adored
face
again
all
the
graciousness
seemed
suddenly
to
be
swept
out
of
my
life
i
pictured
her
forsaken
heartbroken
for
the
second
time
weeping
bitterly
over
this
repetition
of
history
and
including
me
in
her
indictment
of
my
master
at
nineteen
we
are
all
presumptuous
egotists
if
i
mixed
pity
for
myself
with
sorrow
for
joanna
and
dismay
for
my
master
i
am
not
too
greatly
to
be
blamed
the
best
emotions
of
older
wiser
and
better
men
than
i
are
often
blends
of
queer
elements
the
romance
was
dead
there
was
no
more
joanna
i
broke
down
and
shed
tears
into
my
paragot
snored
chapter
xxii
i
spent
the
night
on
the
sofa
as
the
only
bed
in
the
establishment
belonged
to
paragot
the
next
morning
i
took
my
scanty
belongings
to
my
old
attic
which
fortunately
happened
to
be
unlet
and
left
my
master
in
undisturbed
possession
of
his
apartment
in
the
evening
calling
to
make
polite
inquiries
as
to
his
health
i
found
him
still
in
bed
looking
grimier
and
bristlier
than
the
night
before
my
son
said
he
the
bread
of
liberty
is
sweet
but
when
you
are
starving
you
should
not
yourself
an
old
french
writer
says
le
plaisir
vient
la
peine
après
la
peine
la
i
had
the
pain
that
follows
pleasure
but
whether
i
shall
attain
the
consequential
virtue
i
do
know
for
the
present
however
i
am
condemned
to
it
against
my
will
how
so
i
asked
i
have
a
great
desire
to
rise
and
seek
the
nepenthe
of
the
café
delphine
but
a
whimsical
fate
keeps
me
coatless
and
hatless
in
a
virtuous
house
i
am
also
comparatively
shirtless
which
does
not
so
much
matter
i
afraid
my
things
would
fit
you
master
said
i
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
the
only
coat
which
the
good
blanquette
has
preserved
is
the
velveteen
jacket
in
which
i
fiddled
away
so
many
happy
hours
why
not
wear
it
until
your
bag
arrives
from
melford
in
arcadian
villages
he
replied
it
commanded
respect
in
the
café
delphine
i
afraid
it
would
only
excite
derision
presently
a
strong
odour
of
onions
gave
promise
of
an
approaching
meal
and
a
little
while
afterwards
blanquette
entered
with
the
announcement
that
soup
was
on
the
table
paragot
rose
donned
trousers
and
slippers
and
went
forth
into
the
salon
to
dine
simplicity
is
one
of
the
canons
of
high
art
life
is
an
art
as
i
have
endeavoured
to
teach
you
therefore
in
life
we
should
aim
at
simplicity
to
complicate
existence
into
the
intricacy
of
a
with
white
ties
and
red
socks
is
an
offence
against
art
of
which
i
will
never
again
be
guilty
it
is
also
more
comfortable
to
eat
soup
with
your
elbows
on
the
table
blanquette
she
replied
bending
over
her
bowl
where
else
could
one
put
them
this
pleased
paragot
who
continued
to
talk
in
high
good
humour
during
the
rest
of
the
meal
afterwards
he
filled
a
new
porcelain
pipe
which
blanquette
had
purchased
and
smoked
contentedly
the
rest
of
the
evening
blanquette
sat
dutifully
on
a
chair
her
hands
in
her
lap
listening
as
she
had
so
often
done
before
to
our
inspiring
conversation
and
adding
her
word
whenever
it
entered
the
area
of
her
comprehension
if
we
had
lectured
each
other
alternately
on
the
integral
calculus
blanquette
would
have
given
us
her
rapt
and
happy
attention
this
evening
she
would
not
have
minded
our
talking
english
the
mere
sound
of
the
master
voice
was
sweet
sweeter
than
ever
now
that
the
other
woman
had
been
planted
there
she
thought
of
it
with
a
fierce
joy
and
the
master
had
come
back
to
her
for
ever
and
ever
sæculo
sæculorum
like
many
peasant
women
of
strong
nature
she
had
the
terrible
passion
of
possession
in
her
soul
she
would
rather
have
had
the
most
degraded
of
paragots
in
her
arms
as
her
own
unalienable
property
than
have
seen
him
honourable
and
prosperous
in
the
arms
of
another
had
she
been
of
a
nervous
and
emotional
temperament
there
might
have
been
tragedy
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
and
the
newspapers
of
paris
might
have
chronicled
yet
another
and
the
appearance
of
blanquette
before
a
weeping
jury
but
the
days
of
tragedy
were
over
paragot
thundered
invectives
against
insincerity
in
art
we
were
discussing
my
famous
mythological
picture
still
on
the
easel
at
menilmontant
and
blanquette
beamed
approval
she
remarked
referring
to
my
picture
that
she
did
like
so
many
unclad
ladies
it
was
not
decent
besides
if
they
lay
in
the
grass
like
that
they
would
catch
cold
and
they
have
no
to
blow
their
noses
cried
paragot
whereat
blanquette
sense
of
humour
being
tickled
she
screamed
with
laughter
narcisse
sprang
from
sleep
and
barked
and
there
reigned
great
happiness
in
which
even
i
still
reproachful
of
my
master
had
my
share
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
at
home
observed
paragot
i
had
never
heard
him
utter
so
domestic
a
sentiment
pleasure
follows
pain
and
after
pain
comes
virtue
this
is
virtue
with
a
vengeance
i
reflected
cynically
was
blanquette
inevitable
response
when
she
bade
us
good
night
paragot
drew
her
down
and
kissed
her
cheek
which
was
an
unprecedented
mark
of
domesticity
blanquette
turned
and
i
suppose
her
foolish
heart
beat
wildly
i
have
known
my
own
heart
to
beat
wildly
for
far
less
and
i
am
not
a
woman
but
i
have
been
in
love
it
is
because
you
belong
to
me
my
little
blanquette
and
i
am
among
mine
own
people
we
understand
one
another
do
we
tout
comprendre
tout
when
she
had
gone
he
smoked
reflectively
for
a
few
moments
i
never
realised
till
now
said
he
the
sense
of
stability
and
comfort
that
blanquette
affords
me
she
is
unchangeable
god
has
given
her
a
sense
whereby
she
has
pierced
to
the
innermost
thing
that
is
i
and
externals
do
matter
she
has
got
nearer
the
true
paragot
than
you
my
son
although
i
know
you
love
me
what
is
the
true
paragot
master
i
asked
there
are
only
two
that
know
it
blanquette
and
the
i
do
i
only
know
said
i
that
i
owe
my
life
to
you
and
that
i
love
you
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
even
more
than
mme
de
verneuil
he
asked
with
a
smile
i
blushed
she
is
different
said
i
quite
different
he
assented
after
a
long
pause
my
son
he
added
it
is
right
that
you
should
know
why
the
end
came
one
generally
keeps
these
things
to
oneself
but
i
see
you
are
blaming
me
and
a
barrier
may
grow
up
between
us
which
we
should
both
regret
you
think
i
have
treated
your
dear
lady
most
cruelly
i
ca
judge
you
master
said
i
terribly
embarrassed
but
you
do
said
he
paragot
was
in
one
of
his
rare
gentle
moods
he
spoke
softly
without
a
trace
of
reproach
or
irony
he
spoke
too
lying
pipe
in
mouth
on
the
old
rep
sofa
instead
of
walking
about
the
room
he
told
me
his
story
need
i
repeat
it
they
had
escaped
a
misery
but
on
the
other
hand
they
had
lost
a
dream
she
was
still
in
his
eyes
all
that
is
beautiful
and
exquisite
in
woman
but
she
was
not
the
woman
that
berzélius
nibbidard
paragot
could
love
the
twain
had
been
romantic
walking
in
the
valley
of
illusion
wilfully
blinding
their
eyes
to
the
irony
of
things
real
love
had
flown
far
from
them
during
the
silent
years
and
they
had
mistaken
the
afterglow
of
his
wings
for
the
living
radiance
they
had
begun
to
realise
the
desolate
truth
they
read
it
in
each
other
eyes
she
had
been
too
loyal
to
speak
she
would
have
married
him
hoping
as
a
woman
hopes
against
hope
paragot
whose
soul
revolted
from
pretence
preferring
real
mire
to
sham
down
fled
from
the
piteous
tragedy
he
might
have
retired
more
conventionally
he
might
have
had
a
dismal
explanatory
interview
with
joanna
and
ordered
a
fly
to
convey
himself
and
his
luggage
to
the
railway
station
the
next
morning
perhaps
if
joanna
had
found
him
in
the
november
sunday
afternoon
garden
this
might
have
occurred
but
joanna
did
not
find
him
his
temperament
found
him
instead
and
when
you
have
a
temperament
like
paragot
it
plays
the
very
deuce
with
convention
it
drew
him
out
of
the
garden
across
the
channel
and
into
the
society
of
bubu
le
vainqueur
but
all
the
same
in
the
essential
act
of
leaving
melford
paragot
behaved
like
the
man
of
fine
honour
i
shall
always
maintain
him
to
be
how
many
men
of
speckless
reputation
though
feeling
the
pinch
of
poverty
would
not
have
married
joanna
for
the
great
wealth
her
husband
left
behind
answer
me
that
i
know
that
joanna
wept
bitterly
over
her
lost
romance
but
she
has
owned
to
me
that
the
words
written
on
a
scrap
of
paper
by
paragot
and
posted
from
london
were
tragically
true
my
dear
it
is
only
the
shadows
of
our
past
selves
that
love
you
and
i
are
strangers
to
each
other
to
continue
this
sweet
pretence
of
love
is
a
mockery
of
the
holiest
god
bless
you
gaston
if
you
love
a
dream
woman
said
paragot
let
her
stay
the
divine
woman
of
the
dream
to
awaken
and
clasp
flesh
and
blood
no
matter
how
delicately
tender
and
find
that
love
has
sped
at
the
dawn
is
a
misery
too
deep
for
tears
and
paragot
lying
unshaven
unwashed
in
grimy
shirt
and
trousers
smoked
silently
and
stared
into
a
future
in
which
the
dear
sweet
dream
woman
with
the
little
feet
so
adored
would
never
never
again
have
a
place
if
i
had
a
coat
to
my
back
said
he
after
nearly
half
an
silence
i
verily
believe
i
would
go
to
the
pont
neuf
and
talk
to
henri
quatre
fou
had
given
me
a
commission
for
a
front
page
in
colours
and
i
was
deep
in
the
disreputable
task
on
the
following
evening
when
paragot
appeared
in
my
attic
he
wore
a
jacket
his
bag
having
arrived
from
melford
my
soul
hungers
said
he
for
the
café
delphine
and
my
throat
thirsts
for
sociable
alcohol
if
you
can
cease
the
prostitution
of
your
art
to
a
salacious
public
for
an
hour
or
two
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
company
i
think
it
rather
good
said
i
complacently
regarding
the
drawing
with
head
bent
sideways
it
an
old
theme
but
it
up
to
date
at
janot
they
would
say
it
was
palpitating
with
modernity
that
what
makes
it
vile
said
paragot
we
were
thrown
into
immediate
argument
one
of
the
flying
art
notions
of
the
hour
was
to
revive
the
old
subjects
which
contained
the
eternal
essentials
of
life
and
present
them
in
palpitatingly
modern
form
i
eloquently
developed
my
thesis
we
were
sick
to
death
for
instance
of
the
prodigal
son
sitting
in
a
desert
beside
a
swine
trough
was
it
not
more
palpitating
to
set
the
prodigal
in
modern
paris
your
moderns
ca
palpitate
with
dignity
my
son
replied
paragot
take
susannah
and
the
elders
classically
treated
the
subject
might
yet
produce
one
of
the
greatest
pictures
of
all
time
translate
it
into
the
grocer
wife
and
the
two
churchwardens
and
you
can
not
escape
from
bestial
vulgarity
conscious
of
the
wide
horizon
of
extreme
youth
i
sighed
at
my
narrowness
he
was
hopelessly
behind
the
times
i
dropped
the
argument
and
hunted
for
my
cap
we
found
the
café
delphine
fairly
full
madame
boin
whom
the
past
few
months
had
provided
with
a
few
more
rolls
of
fat
round
her
neck
gave
a
little
gasp
as
she
caught
sight
of
paragot
and
held
out
her
hand
over
the
counter
is
it
really
you
monsieur
paragot
one
sees
you
no
more
how
is
that
but
it
is
charming
ah
you
have
been
in
england
dit
que
beau
and
where
will
you
sit
your
place
is
taken
it
is
monsieur
papillard
the
poet
who
has
sat
there
for
a
month
we
will
find
another
table
there
is
one
that
is
free
she
pointed
to
a
draughty
unconsidered
table
by
the
door
paragot
looked
at
it
then
at
madame
boin
and
then
at
his
own
private
and
particular
table
usurped
by
monsieur
papillard
and
his
associates
and
swore
a
stupefied
oath
of
considerable
complication
a
weird
creature
with
a
goatee
beard
scarce
masking
a
receding
chin
sat
in
the
sacred
seat
against
the
wall
his
hat
and
cloak
were
hung
on
paragot
peg
he
was
reading
a
poem
to
half
a
dozen
youths
who
seemed
all
to
be
drinking
or
coffee
in
long
glasses
they
combined
an
air
of
intellectual
intensity
with
one
of
lyrical
enthusiasm
like
little
owls
pretending
to
be
larks
not
one
of
the
old
set
was
there
to
smile
a
welcome
we
stood
by
the
counter
listening
to
the
poem
when
monsieur
papillard
had
ended
the
youths
broke
into
applause
superbe
chef
cher
they
called
the
creature
it
is
demented
idiocy
murmured
my
astounded
master
at
that
moment
entered
félicien
garbure
a
elderly
man
who
had
been
wont
to
sit
at
paragot
table
he
was
one
of
those
parasitic
personages
not
unknown
in
the
who
contrived
to
attach
themselves
to
the
special
circle
of
a
café
and
to
drink
as
much
as
possible
at
other
people
expense
his
education
and
intelligence
would
have
disgraced
a
paris
cabman
but
an
ironical
providence
had
invested
him
with
an
air
of
wisdom
which
gave
to
his
flattery
the
value
of
profound
criticism
this
sycophant
greeted
us
with
effusion
where
had
we
been
why
had
the
delightful
band
been
dispersed
did
we
know
monsieur
papillard
the
great
poet
before
we
could
reply
he
approached
the
chair
permit
me
to
present
to
you
my
friends
monsieur
berzélius
paragot
and
monsieur
asticot
said
the
great
poet
urbanely
we
likewise
avowed
our
enchantment
and
paragot
swore
beneath
his
breath
the
waiter
no
longer
hercule
who
had
been
dismissed
for
petty
thievery
some
time
before
but
a
new
waiter
who
did
not
know
paragot
set
us
chairs
at
the
end
of
the
table
far
away
from
the
great
man
we
ordered
drinks
paragot
emptied
his
glass
in
an
manner
still
under
the
shock
of
his
downfall
but
a
few
short
months
ago
he
had
ruled
in
this
place
as
king
now
he
was
patronizingly
presented
to
the
idiot
usurper
by
félicien
garbure
friend
berzélius
paragot
de
dieu
and
he
was
assigned
a
humble
place
below
the
salt
verily
the
world
was
upside
down
give
me
another
said
paragot
a
double
one
the
poet
read
another
poem
it
was
something
about
topazes
and
serpents
and
the
twilight
and
the
pink
palms
of
a
negress
more
i
could
not
gather
the
company
hailed
it
as
another
masterpiece
félicien
garbure
called
it
a
supreme
effort
of
genius
a
young
man
beside
paragot
vaunted
its
witchery
of
suggestion
it
is
absolute
nonsense
cried
my
master
but
it
is
symbolism
monsieur
replied
the
young
man
in
a
tone
of
indulgent
pity
what
does
it
mean
the
young
man
he
was
very
kind
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
politely
what
in
common
speech
is
the
meaning
of
one
of
bach
fugues
or
claude
monet
effects
of
sunlight
one
can
not
say
they
appeal
direct
to
the
soul
so
does
a
subtle
harmony
of
words
using
words
as
notes
of
music
or
pigments
what
you
will
arranged
by
the
magic
of
a
master
these
things
are
transcendental
monsieur
breathed
paragot
my
little
asticot
he
whispered
to
me
have
i
really
come
to
this
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
an
acting
infant
gamaliel
and
be
taught
the
elements
of
symbolic
poetry
but
master
said
i
somewhat
captivated
by
the
balderdash
there
is
after
all
colour
in
words
do
you
remember
how
delighted
you
were
with
the
name
of
a
little
town
we
passed
through
on
our
way
to
orléans
romorantin
you
were
haunted
by
it
and
said
it
was
like
the
purple
note
of
an
organ
which
shews
you
my
son
that
i
was
aware
of
the
jargon
of
symbolism
before
these
goslings
were
hatched
he
replied
he
drained
his
tumbler
called
the
waiter
and
paid
the
reckoning
let
us
go
to
père
louviot
in
the
halles
where
we
can
meet
some
real
men
and
women
we
went
and
the
café
delphine
knew
paragot
no
more
after
this
he
took
to
frequenting
indiscriminately
the
various
cafés
of
the
neighbourhood
wandering
from
one
to
the
other
like
a
lost
soul
seeking
a
habitation
now
and
again
he
hit
upon
fragments
of
the
old
band
who
had
migrated
from
the
café
delphine
when
it
became
the
home
of
the
symbolic
poets
he
tried
in
vain
to
collect
the
fragments
together
in
a
new
hostelry
but
the
cohesive
force
had
gone
these
queer
circles
of
the
latin
quarter
are
organisms
of
spontaneous
growth
you
can
not
create
them
artificially
or
them
when
once
they
are
disintegrated
the
twos
and
threes
of
students
received
him
kindly
and
listened
to
his
talk
but
his
authority
was
gone
once
or
twice
when
i
accompanied
him
i
fancied
that
he
had
lost
also
the
peculiar
magic
of
his
vehement
utterances
cazalet
also
noticed
a
change
what
is
the
matter
with
paragot
he
no
longer
talks
he
preaches
ennuie
à
la
paragot
a
bore
it
was
unimaginable
was
he
paying
the
penalty
of
his
past
respectability
had
melford
repressed
his
noble
rage
and
frozen
the
genial
current
of
his
soul
it
is
not
unlikely
he
often
found
himself
condemned
to
solitary
toping
over
a
stained
newspaper
one
of
the
most
ungleeful
joys
known
to
man
sometimes
he
played
dominoes
with
félicien
garbure
now
icily
received
by
the
symbolists
on
account
of
an
unpaid
score
whether
desperation
drove
him
occasionally
to
bubu
le
vainqueur
and
his
friends
i
do
not
know
he
was
not
really
proud
of
his
acquaintance
with
bubu
once
he
whimsically
remarked
that
as
he
was
half
way
between
gaston
de
nérac
and
berzélius
paragot
and
therefore
neither
fish
nor
fowl
he
could
not
find
an
appropriate
hole
in
paris
but
when
his
hair
and
his
beard
and
his
finger
nails
had
attained
their
old
luxuriance
of
growth
and
he
was
in
every
way
paragot
again
the
desired
haven
remained
still
unfindable
there
were
taverns
without
number
and
drink
in
oceans
and
the
life
of
paris
surged
up
and
down
the
boulevards
as
stimulating
as
ever
but
the
heart
of
paragot
cried
out
for
something
different
he
took
the
old
violin
from
its
dirty
case
and
spent
hours
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
trying
to
fiddle
the
divine
despair
out
of
his
system
sometimes
he
would
call
upon
blanquette
to
accompany
him
on
her
almost
forgotten
zither
one
day
he
was
with
me
at
the
café
opposite
janot
when
two
or
three
of
the
studio
came
in
and
sat
at
our
table
there
was
the
usual
eager
talk
the
subject
the
new
impressionism
but
to
understand
it
you
must
be
in
the
movement
cried
fougère
not
dreaming
of
discourtesy
but
paragot
took
the
saying
to
heart
i
see
it
now
said
he
afterwards
i
am
no
longer
in
the
movement
you
young
men
have
passed
me
by
i
am
left
stranded
you
may
ask
why
i
seek
the
company
of
my
own
contemporaries
who
are
they
that
know
me
save
worthless
rags
like
félicien
garbure
stranded
my
son
i
have
had
my
day
after
that
he
refused
to
talk
at
such
social
gatherings
as
chance
afforded
and
moodily
listened
while
he
consumed
profitless
alcohol
then
he
began
to
frequent
the
cafés
of
the
halles
when
he
had
nearly
poisoned
himself
with
vile
absinthe
and
sickened
himself
with
the
conversation
of
fishwives
he
sent
for
me
in
despair
i
found
him
walking
up
and
down
the
salon
he
looked
very
i
am
going
to
leave
paris
he
began
as
soon
as
i
entered
it
is
a
city
of
dead
sea
apples
it
has
no
place
for
me
save
the
sewer
i
do
like
the
sewer
i
am
going
away
i
shall
never
come
back
to
paris
again
but
where
are
you
going
master
i
asked
in
some
surprise
he
did
not
know
he
would
pack
his
bundle
and
flee
like
christian
from
the
accursed
city
like
christian
he
would
go
on
a
pilgrim
progress
he
would
seek
sweet
pure
things
he
would
go
forth
and
work
in
the
fields
the
old
life
had
come
to
an
end
the
sow
had
been
mistaken
it
could
not
return
to
its
wallowing
in
the
mire
wallowing
was
disgustful
was
ever
man
in
such
a
position
the
vagabond
life
had
made
the
conventions
of
civilisation
impossible
the
contact
with
convention
and
clean
english
ways
had
killed
his
zest
for
the
old
order
of
which
only
the
mud
remained
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
leave
paris
he
poured
out
his
heart
to
me
in
a
torrent
of
excited
words
here
and
there
none
too
coherent
he
must
work
he
had
lost
the
great
art
by
which
he
was
to
cover
europe
with
palaces
that
was
no
longer
my
god
said
he
stopping
short
the
true
knowledge
of
it
has
only
come
to
me
lately
i
was
living
in
a
fool
paradise
i
could
never
have
designed
a
building
i
should
have
lived
on
her
bounty
thank
god
i
was
saved
the
shame
of
it
he
went
on
again
he
repeated
his
intention
of
leaving
paris
i
must
look
after
blanquette
for
the
present
he
must
go
and
dree
his
weird
alone
and
yet
my
little
asticot
it
is
the
dreadful
loneliness
that
frightens
me
once
i
had
a
dream
it
sufficed
me
but
now
my
soul
is
empty
a
man
needs
a
woman
in
his
life
even
a
dream
woman
but
for
me
there
is
not
a
woman
in
the
wide
world
who
would
look
at
me
now
master
said
i
if
you
are
going
to
settle
down
in
the
country
why
do
you
marry
blanquette
marry
blanquette
marry
he
regarded
me
in
simple
undisguised
amazement
which
took
his
breath
away
he
passed
his
hand
through
his
hair
and
sat
on
the
nearest
seat
de
dieu
said
he
i
never
thought
of
it
then
he
leaped
up
and
caught
me
in
the
old
way
by
the
shoulders
and
cried
in
french
as
he
did
in
moments
of
great
excitement
but
it
colossal
that
idea
it
is
the
solution
of
everything
and
i
never
thought
of
it
though
it
has
been
staring
me
in
the
face
why
i
love
her
our
little
blanquette
i
have
loved
her
all
the
time
without
knowing
it
as
the
good
monsieur
jourdain
spoke
prose
nom
petit
bonhomme
why
did
you
tell
me
before
confounded
little
animal
that
you
are
he
swung
me
with
a
laugh
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
waved
his
arms
grotesquely
as
he
continued
his
dithyrambic
eulogy
of
the
colossal
idea
i
have
never
seen
two
minutes
produce
a
greater
change
in
a
human
countenance
ten
years
fell
from
it
he
looked
even
younger
than
when
he
had
broken
his
fiddle
over
pogson
head
and
received
the
inspiration
of
our
vagabondage
his
blue
eyes
cleared
and
in
them
shone
the
miraculous
light
of
laughter
but
it
was
written
my
son
asticot
it
was
preordained
she
is
the
one
woman
in
the
world
to
whom
i
need
not
pretend
to
be
other
than
i
am
she
is
nom
de
what
she
says
is
blanquette
what
she
does
is
blanquette
and
her
sayings
and
doings
would
grace
the
greatest
queen
in
christendom
but
have
you
thought
of
it
i
have
come
indeed
to
the
end
of
my
journey
i
started
out
to
find
truth
the
reality
of
things
i
have
found
it
i
have
found
it
my
son
it
is
a
woman
strong
and
steadfast
who
looks
into
your
eyes
who
can
help
a
man
to
accomplish
his
destiny
and
the
destiny
of
man
is
to
work
and
to
beget
strong
children
and
his
reward
is
to
have
the
light
in
the
wife
eyes
and
the
welcome
of
a
child
voice
as
he
crosses
the
threshold
of
his
house
and
it
cleanses
a
man
but
blanquette
he
smote
his
forehead
and
burst
into
excited
laughter
why
did
it
not
enter
into
this
idiot
head
before
the
laughter
ceased
all
of
a
sudden
and
at
least
three
years
returned
to
his
face
it
takes
two
parties
to
make
a
marriage
said
he
in
a
chastened
tone
blanquette
is
young
i
am
not
she
may
be
thinking
of
a
future
quite
different
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
i
will
marry
blanquette
but
will
blanquette
marry
me
master
said
i
feeling
a
person
of
elderly
experience
it
was
entirely
on
your
account
that
blanquette
refused
the
at
the
corner
of
the
street
i
had
learned
from
her
the
day
before
that
the
superior
hardware
merchant
had
recently
made
her
a
ceremonious
offer
of
marriage
a
sense
of
duty
perhaps
said
paragot
i
laughed
at
his
seriousness
but
master
she
has
been
eating
her
heart
out
for
you
since
the
wedding
at
chambéry
asticot
said
he
planting
himself
in
front
of
me
are
you
jesting
or
speaking
what
you
know
to
be
the
truth
the
absolute
truth
and
you
never
told
me
you
knew
that
a
real
woman
loved
me
and
you
let
me
chase
a
with
gloves
and
an
umbrella
truly
a
foes
are
of
his
own
household
but
master
i
began
he
laughed
at
the
sight
of
my
dejected
face
no
you
were
loyal
my
son
the
man
who
gives
away
a
confidence
even
when
she
avows
the
poisoning
of
her
husband
and
the
strangulation
of
her
babes
is
a
transpontine
villain
he
took
up
his
porcelain
pipe
and
filled
it
from
the
blue
packet
of
caporal
that
lay
on
the
table
with
the
oilskin
cover
he
struck
a
match
and
was
about
to
apply
it
to
the
bowl
when
one
of
his
sudden
ideas
caused
him
to
blow
out
the
match
and
lay
down
the
pipe
then
with
his
old
lightning
swiftness
he
strode
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
blanquette
blanquette
he
cried
came
from
the
kitchen
and
in
a
moment
blanquette
entered
the
room
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
to
the
centre
while
she
regarded
him
somewhat
mystified
with
his
heels
together
he
made
her
a
correct
bow
blanquette
said
he
in
the
presence
of
asticot
as
witness
i
ask
you
to
do
me
the
honour
to
become
my
wife
it
was
magnificent
it
was
what
paragot
would
have
called
but
it
was
not
tactful
it
was
half
an
hour
before
blanquette
fully
grasped
the
situation
chapter
xxiii
joanna
married
major
walters
as
soon
as
the
conventionalities
would
permit
she
wrote
then
for
the
first
time
to
paragot
i
bear
you
no
malice
my
dear
gaston
and
i
am
sure
you
bear
me
none
your
breaking
off
of
our
engagement
was
the
only
way
out
of
a
fantastic
situation
you
might
have
broken
it
less
abruptly
but
you
were
always
sudden
if
i
may
believe
asticot
your
own
marriage
was
a
lightning
incident
i
can
laugh
now
and
so
i
suppose
can
your
wife
but
believe
me
this
sort
of
thing
does
leave
a
woman
rather
breathless
wish
me
happiness
as
i
wish
you
if
ever
we
meet
it
will
be
as
loyal
friends
could
woman
have
spoken
more
sweetly
my
dear
joanna
replied
paragot
i
do
wish
you
all
the
happiness
in
the
world
you
ca
fail
to
have
it
you
have
a
real
husband
as
i
have
a
real
wife
let
us
thank
heaven
we
have
escaped
from
the
moon
vapour
of
the
ideal
in
which
we
poor
humans
are
apt
to
lose
our
way
and
stray
god
knows
whither
i
am
sending
you
a
real
marriage
gift
my
dear
asticot
wrote
joanna
from
an
hotel
in
florence
what
do
you
think
your
delightful
but
absurd
master
has
sent
me
as
a
wedding
present
it
arrived
here
this
morning
to
the
consternation
of
the
whole
hotel
a
crate
containing
six
live
ducks
the
label
stated
that
they
were
real
ducks
fed
by
his
own
hand
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
six
live
ducks
on
a
wedding
journey
my
dear
asticot
i
ca
sell
them
i
hate
the
idea
of
eating
them
and
even
if
i
did
major
walters
and
i
ca
eat
six
and
i
ca
put
blue
ribbons
round
their
necks
and
carry
them
about
with
me
on
my
travels
as
pets
ca
you
see
me
walking
over
the
ponte
vecchio
followed
by
them
as
by
a
string
of
poodles
and
they
are
so
voracious
the
hotel
people
are
already
charging
them
full
pension
terms
oh
dear
do
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
with
these
dreadful
fowl
my
dearest
lady
i
answered
offer
the
ducks
like
the
dunmow
flitch
of
bacon
to
the
most
happily
married
couple
in
florence
whether
joanna
acted
on
my
brilliant
suggestion
i
can
not
say
a
little
while
ago
i
enquired
after
their
ultimate
destiny
but
joanna
had
forgotten
i
believe
major
walters
and
herself
fled
from
them
secretly
paragot
on
his
label
stated
that
he
had
fed
the
ducks
with
his
own
hand
this
was
practically
true
indeed
in
the
case
of
those
who
declined
to
nourish
themselves
to
the
requisite
degree
of
fatness
it
was
literally
true
i
have
beheld
him
since
perform
the
astounding
operation
a
sight
but
not
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
it
was
on
his
own
farm
the
farm
near
chartres
which
he
bought
in
his
bewildering
fashion
as
soon
as
lawyers
could
prepare
the
necessary
documents
he
took
train
the
day
after
his
proposal
of
marriage
to
blanquette
and
returned
i
remember
somewhat
crestfallen
because
he
could
not
conclude
the
purchase
then
and
there
my
dear
sir
said
the
lawyer
whom
he
consulted
you
ca
buy
landed
property
as
you
can
a
pound
of
sugar
over
a
counter
why
not
asked
paragot
because
said
the
lawyer
the
law
of
france
mercifully
concedes
to
men
of
my
profession
the
right
of
gaining
a
livelihood
i
see
that
you
are
a
real
lawyer
said
paragot
pleased
by
the
irony
and
it
is
an
amiable
providence
that
has
guided
my
steps
to
your
but
paragot
was
married
and
the
little
in
the
rue
des
saladiers
passed
into
alien
hands
and
the
newly
wedded
pair
settled
down
on
the
farm
long
before
all
the
legal
formalities
of
purchase
were
accomplished
it
takes
my
breath
away
even
now
to
think
of
the
hurry
of
those
days
he
decided
human
destinies
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
my
son
said
he
when
i
have
paid
for
this
farm
i
shall
have
very
little
indeed
of
the
capital
on
the
interest
of
which
we
have
been
living
i
am
now
a
married
man
with
the
responsibilities
of
a
wife
and
a
future
family
i
have
put
to
your
credit
at
the
crédit
lyonnais
and
that
is
all
your
fortune
if
art
ca
support
you
when
you
have
spent
it
you
will
have
to
come
to
la
haye
the
farm
and
feed
pigs
you
be
richer
if
you
paint
them
the
piggier
they
are
and
the
heavier
the
gold
watch
chains
across
their
bellies
the
richer
you
will
be
but
you
be
happier
if
you
feed
them
i
went
to
bed
that
night
swearing
a
great
oath
that
i
would
neither
paint
pigs
nor
feed
pigs
but
that
i
would
prove
myself
worthy
of
the
generosity
of
my
master
and
benefactor
i
felt
then
that
his
goodness
was
great
but
how
great
it
was
i
only
realised
in
after
years
when
i
came
to
learn
his
financial
position
bearing
in
mind
the
relativity
of
things
i
know
that
few
fathers
have
sent
their
sons
out
into
the
world
with
so
princely
a
capital
fortune
smiled
on
me
why
i
do
know
perhaps
because
i
was
small
and
sandy
haired
and
harmless
and
did
not
worry
her
i
sold
two
or
three
pictures
i
obtained
regular
employment
on
an
illustrated
journal
and
raised
my
price
for
contributions
to
fou
bread
and
butter
were
assured
there
was
never
prouder
youth
than
i
when
one
august
morning
i
started
from
paris
for
chartres
with
fifty
superfluous
pounds
in
my
pocket
which
i
determined
to
restore
to
paragot
the
old
paragot
of
the
high
roads
hairy
and
bronzed
and
wearing
a
great
straw
hat
with
wide
brim
turned
down
met
me
at
the
little
local
station
he
forgot
that
he
was
half
british
and
almost
hugged
me
at
last
i
had
come
it
was
my
third
visit
at
last
i
had
torn
myself
away
from
that
paris
and
its
and
its
and
its
artificialities
nothing
is
real
in
paris
whether
it
be
the
smile
on
the
painted
lips
or
the
dream
of
the
young
poet
here
in
the
midst
of
god
fields
there
is
no
pretending
no
shamming
no
lying
none
of
your
confounded
idealism
all
is
solid
solid
like
that
and
he
thumped
his
chest
to
illustrate
the
argument
bucéphale
too
i
queried
with
a
laugh
as
we
fetched
up
beside
the
most
ancient
horse
in
the
department
drooping
between
the
shafts
of
a
springless
cart
needless
to
say
bucéphale
had
been
rechristened
in
his
extreme
old
age
he
is
a
living
proof
cried
paragot
of
the
solidity
look
at
him
shew
me
a
horse
of
his
age
in
paris
the
paris
horses
like
youth
in
the
poem
grow
pale
and
spectre
thin
and
die
of
premature
decay
here
said
he
giving
a
sou
to
a
blue
bloused
urchin
who
was
restraining
the
impetuous
bucéphale
from
a
wild
gallop
over
the
eure
et
loire
when
you
have
spent
that
come
to
la
haye
and
i
will
give
you
another
he
threw
my
bag
into
the
cart
and
we
took
our
places
on
the
plank
that
served
as
a
seat
bucéphale
cried
paragot
gathering
up
the
reins
observe
the
kindly
manners
of
the
country
if
i
had
addressed
him
like
your
paris
cabman
with
a
cocotte
it
would
have
wounded
his
susceptibilities
bucéphale
started
off
down
the
straight
white
road
edged
with
poplars
while
paragot
talked
and
the
sun
blazed
down
upon
us
from
a
cobalt
sky
all
around
the
fertile
plain
laughed
in
the
sunshine
a
giant
contented
laugh
like
that
of
its
daughters
who
greeted
paragot
as
we
raced
by
at
the
rate
of
five
miles
an
hour
did
i
ever
meet
a
paris
horse
that
went
this
speed
asked
paragot
and
i
answered
him
truthfully
never
we
stopped
in
a
village
beside
a
tiny
shop
gloriously
adorned
with
a
gilt
bull
head
the
butcher
wife
came
out
monsieur
paragot
madame
jolivet
have
you
a
nice
fatted
calf
for
this
young
prodigal
from
paris
if
you
have
we
can
do
with
four
kilos
of
good
beef
and
the
result
of
ten
minutes
talk
was
a
great
lump
of
raw
meat
badly
wrapped
in
newspaper
which
paragot
careless
of
my
paris
clothes
thrust
on
my
knees
while
he
continued
to
drive
bucéphale
i
dropped
the
beef
into
the
back
of
the
cart
paragot
shook
his
head
my
son
you
shall
be
clothed
in
humility
and
shall
clean
out
the
cow
pen
i
should
prefer
to
accept
your
original
invitation
master
said
i
and
help
with
the
corn
for
paragot
besides
bucéphale
and
cows
and
ducks
and
pigs
and
fowls
and
a
meadow
or
two
possessed
a
patch
of
cornfield
of
which
he
was
passionately
proud
he
had
sown
it
himself
that
spring
and
now
was
harvest
he
pointed
to
it
with
his
whip
as
soon
as
we
came
in
sight
of
the
farm
corn
my
little
asticot
it
is
marvellous
eh
who
says
that
berzélius
nibbidard
paragot
ca
make
things
grow
i
was
born
to
it
de
i
could
make
anything
grow
i
could
plant
your
palette
and
it
would
come
up
a
landscape
and
mille
i
have
done
the
most
miraculous
thing
of
all
i
am
the
father
of
a
human
being
a
real
live
human
being
my
son
he
is
small
as
yet
he
added
apologetically
but
still
he
is
alive
he
has
teeth
asticot
it
is
the
most
remarkable
thing
in
this
astonishing
universe
the
dim
form
of
a
woman
standing
with
a
child
in
her
arms
in
front
of
a
group
of
farm
buildings
across
the
fields
to
the
right
gradually
grew
into
the
familiar
figure
of
my
dear
blanquette
she
came
down
the
road
to
meet
us
her
broad
homely
face
beaming
with
gladness
and
in
her
eyes
a
new
light
of
welcome
narcisse
trotted
at
her
heels
the
rheumatism
of
advancing
years
gave
him
a
distinguished
gait
we
sprang
from
the
cart
bucéphale
left
to
himself
regarded
the
family
meeting
with
a
grandfatherly
air
until
an
nondescript
emerged
from
the
ground
and
led
him
off
towards
the
house
after
our
embraces
we
followed
paragot
dancing
the
delighted
infant
blanquette
with
her
great
motherly
arm
around
my
shoulders
and
narcisse
soberly
sniffing
for
adventure
after
the
manner
of
elderly
dogs
do
you
remember
asticot
said
blanquette
four
of
us
started
for
chambéry
now
five
of
us
come
to
la
haye
drôle
hein
es
contente
i
asked
her
arm
tightened
and
her
eyes
grew
moist
she
said
in
a
low
voice
then
she
looked
at
paragot
and
the
child
a
yard
or
two
in
front
of
us
he
is
the
image
of
his
father
she
said
almost
reverentially
i
burst
out
laughing
where
the
likeness
lay
between
the
chubby
eighteen
months
old
baby
and
the
hairy
battered
paragot
no
human
eye
but
blanquette
could
discover
i
vowed
he
resembled
a
little
japanese
idol
said
blanquette
motherwise
the
house
of
paragot
was
not
a
palace
it
stood
low
and
whitewashed
amid
a
medley
of
little
erections
and
was
guarded
on
one
side
by
cowsheds
and
on
the
other
by
the
haystack
you
stepped
across
the
threshold
into
the
kitchen
a
door
on
the
right
gave
access
to
the
bedroom
a
ladder
connected
with
a
hole
in
the
roof
enabled
you
to
reach
the
cockloft
the
guest
room
of
the
establishment
that
was
all
what
on
earth
could
man
want
more
asked
paragot
the
old
rep
suite
the
table
with
the
american
cloth
the
coloured
prints
in
gilt
frames
including
the
portrait
of
garibaldi
the
cheap
deal
bookcases
holding
paragot
tattered
classics
gave
the
place
an
air
of
familiar
homeliness
a
mattock
a
gun
and
a
cradle
warred
against
old
associations
when
we
entered
the
child
began
to
whimper
perhaps
it
did
not
approve
of
the
gun
like
myself
he
may
in
trembling
fancy
have
heard
its
owner
cry
i
have
an
inspiration
let
us
go
out
and
shoot
cows
paragot
found
another
reason
that
infant
life
is
a
perpetual
rebellion
against
his
name
i
chose
triptolème
a
beautiful
name
if
you
look
at
him
you
see
it
written
all
over
him
blanquette
was
crazy
for
thomas
in
indignation
i
swore
he
should
be
christened
triptolème
onésime
blanquette
wept
i
yielded
least
let
him
be
called
didyme
i
pleaded
didyme
there
is
something
caressing
about
didyme
repeat
it
but
no
blanquette
wept
louder
she
wept
so
loud
that
all
the
ducks
ran
in
to
see
whether
i
was
murdering
her
it
is
not
true
protested
blanquette
how
can
you
say
those
things
you
know
they
are
not
true
her
state
was
so
terrible
continued
my
master
that
i
sacrificed
my
son
destiny
behold
thomas
i
too
would
howl
if
i
had
such
a
name
he
is
hungry
said
blanquette
and
it
is
a
very
pretty
name
he
likes
to
hear
it
pas
mon
petit
there
he
smiles
she
is
really
convinced
that
he
has
heard
her
call
him
thomas
oh
woman
said
paragot
that
evening
after
we
had
feasted
on
and
the
piece
of
beef
which
i
had
been
too
to
dandle
on
my
knees
and
clear
brown
cider
the
three
of
us
sat
outside
the
house
in
the
warm
august
moonlight
sinking
into
an
infinitely
far
horizon
stretched
the
fruitful
plain
of
france
cornland
and
pasture
and
near
us
the
stacked
sheaves
of
paragot
corn
stood
quiet
and
pregnant
symbols
of
the
good
plenty
here
and
there
dark
patches
of
orchard
dreamed
in
a
haze
through
one
distant
patch
a
farmhouse
struck
a
muffled
note
of
grey
on
the
left
the
ribbon
of
road
glistened
white
between
the
sentinel
poplars
silhouetted
against
the
sky
the
hot
smell
of
the
earth
filled
the
air
like
spice
a
thousand
elfin
sounds
the
vibration
of
leaves
the
tiny
crackling
of
cornstalks
the
fairy
whirr
of
ground
insects
melted
into
a
companionable
stillness
blanquette
half
dozed
her
head
against
paragot
shoulder
as
she
had
done
that
evening
of
our
return
from
chambéry
the
smoke
from
his
porcelain
pipe
curled
upwards
through
the
still
air
i
was
near
enough
to
him
on
the
other
side
for
him
to
lay
his
hand
on
my
arm
my
son
he
whispered
in
english
i
was
right
when
i
said
i
had
come
to
the
end
of
my
journey
eventually
i
am
right
in
everything
i
prophesied
that
i
would
make
little
augustus
smith
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
i
knew
that
my
long
pilgrimage
would
ultimately
lead
me
to
the
inner
shrine
is
all
this
he
waved
his
pipe
in
a
circular
gesture
the
holy
of
holies
of
the
real
is
there
any
illusion
in
the
unutterable
poetry
of
the
night
is
there
anything
false
in
this
promise
of
the
fruitful
earth
my
god
asticot
i
am
happy
when
the
soul
laughs
tears
come
into
the
eyes
i
have
all
that
the
heart
of
man
can
desire
the
love
of
this
dear
wife
of
mine
the
child
asleep
within
doors
the
printed
wisdom
of
the
world
in
a
dozen
tongues
of
men
caught
up
in
what
i
once
in
a
failing
hour
thought
was
my
wildgoose
chase
after
truth
the
pride
in
you
my
little
asticot
the
son
of
my
adoption
and
the
most
overpowering
sleepiness
that
ever
sat
upon
mortal
eyelid
he
yawned
i
protested
it
was
barely
nine
it
is
bedtime
said
paragot
we
have
to
get
up
at
five
good
heavens
master
said
i
why
these
unearthly
hours
he
laughed
and
quoted
candide
faut
cultiver
notre
no
said
the
drowsy
blanquette
at
last
understanding
the
conversation
we
have
to
cut
the
rest
of
the
corn
it
all
the
same
my
dear
said
paragot
tenderly
we
were
talking
philosophy
philosophy
merely
means
the
love
of
wisdom
and
all
that
the
wisdom
of
all
the
ages
can
tell
us
is
summed
up
in
the
last
words
of
one
of
the
wisest
books
that
ever
was
written
must
cultivate
our
garden
but
how
my
dear
erratic
master
has
managed
for
years
and
years
to
cultivate
the
farm
of
la
haye
and
to
bring
up
my
godson
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
the
practice
of
land
surveying
is
a
proof
that
the
late
matthew
arnold
was
hopelessly
wrong
in
his
categorical
declaration
that
miracles
do
not
