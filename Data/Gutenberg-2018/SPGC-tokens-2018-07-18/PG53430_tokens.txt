preface
it
appears
to
me
that
in
ethics
as
in
all
other
philosophical
studies
the
difficulties
and
disagreements
of
which
its
history
is
full
are
mainly
due
to
a
very
simple
cause
namely
to
the
attempt
to
answer
questions
without
first
discovering
precisely
question
it
is
which
you
desire
to
answer
i
do
not
know
how
far
this
source
of
error
would
be
done
away
if
philosophers
would
to
discover
what
question
they
were
asking
before
they
set
about
to
answer
it
for
the
work
of
analysis
and
distinction
is
often
very
difficult
we
may
often
fail
to
make
the
necessary
discovery
even
though
we
make
a
definite
attempt
to
do
so
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
in
many
cases
a
resolute
attempt
would
be
sufficient
to
ensure
success
so
that
if
only
this
attempt
were
made
many
of
the
most
glaring
difficulties
and
disagreements
in
philosophy
would
disappear
at
all
events
philosophers
seem
in
general
not
to
make
the
attempt
and
whether
in
consequence
of
this
omission
or
not
they
are
constantly
endeavouring
to
prove
that
yes
or
no
will
answer
questions
to
which
answer
is
correct
owing
to
the
fact
that
what
they
have
before
their
minds
is
not
one
question
but
several
to
some
of
which
the
true
answer
is
no
to
others
i
have
tried
in
this
book
to
distinguish
clearly
two
kinds
of
question
which
moral
philosophers
have
always
professed
to
answer
but
which
as
i
have
tried
to
shew
they
have
almost
always
confused
both
with
one
another
and
with
other
questions
these
two
questions
may
be
expressed
the
first
in
the
form
what
kind
of
things
ought
to
exist
for
their
own
sakes
the
second
in
the
form
what
kind
of
actions
ought
we
to
perform
i
have
tried
to
shew
exactly
what
it
is
that
we
ask
about
a
thing
when
we
ask
whether
it
ought
to
exist
for
its
own
sake
is
good
in
itself
or
has
intrinsic
value
and
exactly
what
it
is
that
we
ask
about
an
action
when
we
ask
whether
we
ought
to
do
it
whether
it
is
a
right
action
or
a
duty
but
from
a
clear
insight
into
the
nature
of
these
two
questions
there
appears
to
me
to
follow
a
second
most
important
result
namely
what
is
the
nature
of
the
evidence
by
which
alone
any
ethical
proposition
can
be
proved
or
disproved
confirmed
or
rendered
doubtful
once
we
recognise
the
exact
meaning
of
the
two
questions
i
think
it
also
becomes
plain
exactly
what
kind
of
reasons
are
relevant
as
arguments
for
or
against
any
particular
answer
to
them
it
becomes
plain
that
for
answers
to
the
question
no
relevant
evidence
whatever
can
be
adduced
from
no
other
truth
except
themselves
alone
can
it
be
inferred
that
they
are
either
true
or
false
we
can
guard
against
error
only
by
taking
care
that
when
we
try
to
answer
a
question
of
this
kind
we
have
before
our
minds
that
question
only
and
not
some
other
or
others
but
that
there
is
great
danger
of
such
errors
of
confusion
i
have
tried
to
shew
and
also
what
are
the
chief
precautions
by
the
use
of
which
we
may
guard
against
them
as
for
the
question
it
becomes
equally
plain
that
any
answer
to
it
capable
of
proof
or
disproof
that
indeed
so
many
different
considerations
are
relevant
to
its
truth
or
falsehood
as
to
make
the
attainment
of
probability
very
difficult
and
the
attainment
of
certainty
impossible
nevertheless
the
of
evidence
which
is
both
necessary
and
alone
relevant
to
such
proof
and
disproof
is
capable
of
exact
definition
such
evidence
must
contain
propositions
of
two
kinds
and
of
two
kinds
only
it
must
consist
in
the
first
place
of
truths
with
regard
to
the
results
of
the
action
in
question
of
truths
but
it
must
contain
ethical
truths
of
our
first
or
class
many
truths
of
both
kinds
are
necessary
to
the
proof
that
any
action
ought
to
be
done
and
any
other
kind
of
evidence
is
wholly
irrelevant
it
follows
that
if
any
ethical
philosopher
offers
for
propositions
of
the
first
kind
any
evidence
whatever
or
if
for
propositions
of
the
second
kind
he
either
fails
to
adduce
both
causal
and
ethical
truths
or
adduces
truths
that
are
neither
his
reasoning
has
not
the
least
tendency
to
establish
his
conclusions
but
not
only
are
his
conclusions
totally
devoid
of
weight
we
have
moreover
reason
to
suspect
him
of
the
error
of
confusion
since
the
offering
of
irrelevant
evidence
generally
indicates
that
the
philosopher
who
offers
it
has
had
before
his
mind
not
the
question
which
he
professes
to
answer
but
some
other
entirely
different
one
ethical
discussion
hitherto
has
perhaps
consisted
chiefly
in
reasoning
of
this
totally
irrelevant
kind
one
main
object
of
this
book
may
then
be
expressed
by
slightly
changing
one
of
kant
s
famous
titles
i
have
endeavoured
to
write
prolegomena
to
any
future
ethics
that
can
possibly
pretend
to
be
in
other
words
i
have
endeavoured
to
discover
what
are
the
fundamental
principles
of
ethical
reasoning
and
the
establishment
of
these
principles
rather
than
of
any
conclusions
which
may
be
attained
by
their
use
may
be
regarded
as
my
main
object
i
have
however
also
attempted
in
chapter
vi
to
present
some
conclusions
with
regard
to
the
proper
answer
of
the
question
what
is
good
in
itself
which
are
very
different
from
any
which
have
commonly
been
advocated
by
philosophers
i
have
tried
to
define
the
classes
within
which
all
great
goods
and
evils
fall
and
i
have
maintained
that
very
many
different
things
are
good
and
evil
in
themselves
and
that
neither
class
of
things
possesses
any
other
property
which
is
both
common
to
all
its
members
and
peculiar
to
them
in
order
to
express
the
fact
that
ethical
propositions
of
my
class
are
incapable
of
proof
or
disproof
i
have
sometimes
followed
sidgwick
s
usage
in
calling
them
but
i
beg
it
may
be
noticed
that
i
am
not
an
intuitionist
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
sidgwick
himself
seems
never
to
have
been
clearly
aware
of
the
immense
importance
of
the
difference
which
distinguishes
his
intuitionism
from
the
common
doctrine
which
has
generally
been
called
by
that
name
the
intuitionist
proper
is
distinguished
by
maintaining
that
propositions
of
my
class
propositions
which
assert
that
a
certain
action
is
or
a
are
incapable
of
proof
or
disproof
by
any
enquiry
into
the
results
of
such
actions
i
on
the
contrary
am
no
less
anxious
to
maintain
that
propositions
of
kind
are
intuitions
than
to
maintain
that
propositions
of
my
class
intuitions
again
i
would
wish
it
observed
that
when
i
call
such
propositions
intuitions
i
mean
to
assert
that
they
are
incapable
of
proof
i
imply
nothing
whatever
as
to
the
manner
or
origin
of
our
cognition
of
them
still
less
do
i
imply
as
most
intuitionists
have
done
that
any
proposition
whatever
is
true
we
cognise
it
in
a
particular
way
or
by
the
exercise
of
any
particular
faculty
i
hold
on
the
contrary
that
in
every
way
in
which
it
is
possible
to
cognise
a
true
proposition
it
is
also
possible
to
cognise
a
false
one
when
this
book
had
been
already
completed
i
found
in
brentano
s
origin
of
the
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
opinions
far
more
closely
resembling
my
own
than
those
of
any
other
ethical
writer
with
whom
i
am
acquainted
brentano
appears
to
agree
with
me
completely
in
regarding
all
ethical
propositions
as
defined
by
the
fact
that
they
predicate
a
single
unique
objective
concept
in
dividing
such
propositions
sharply
into
the
same
two
kinds
in
holding
that
the
first
kind
are
incapable
of
proof
and
with
regard
to
the
kind
of
evidence
which
is
necessary
and
relevant
to
the
proof
of
the
second
kind
but
he
regards
the
fundamental
ethical
concept
as
being
not
the
simple
one
which
i
denote
by
good
but
the
complex
one
which
i
have
taken
to
define
beautiful
and
he
does
not
recognise
but
even
denies
by
implication
the
principle
which
i
have
called
principle
of
organic
in
consequence
of
these
two
differences
his
conclusions
as
to
what
things
are
good
in
themselves
also
differ
very
materially
from
mine
he
agrees
however
that
there
are
many
different
goods
and
that
the
love
of
good
and
beautiful
objects
constitutes
an
important
class
among
them
the
origin
of
the
knowledge
of
right

i
have
written
a
review
of
this
book
which
will
i
hope
appear
in
the
journal
of
for
october
i
may
refer
to
this
review
for
a
fuller
account
of
my
reasons
for
disagreeing
with
brentano
i
wish
to
refer
to
one
oversight
of
which
i
became
aware
only
when
it
was
too
late
to
correct
it
and
which
may
i
am
afraid
cause
unnecessary
trouble
to
some
readers
i
have
omitted
to
discuss
directly
the
mutual
relations
of
the
several
different
notions
which
are
all
expressed
by
the
word
the
consequences
of
this
omission
may
perhaps
be
partially
avoided
by
a
reference
to
my
article
on
teleology
in
baldwin
s
of
philosophy
and
if
i
were
to
rewrite
my
work
now
i
should
make
a
very
different
and
i
believe
that
i
could
make
a
much
better
book
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
in
attempting
to
satisfy
myself
i
might
not
merely
render
more
obscure
the
ideas
which
i
am
most
anxious
to
convey
without
a
corresponding
gain
in
completeness
and
accuracy
however
that
may
be
my
belief
that
to
publish
the
book
as
it
stands
was
probably
the
best
thing
i
could
do
does
not
prevent
me
from
being
painfully
aware
that
it
is
full
of
defects

chapter
i
the
of
ethics
a
section
page
in
order
to
define
ethics
we
must
discover
what
is
both
common
and
peculiar
to
all
undoubted
ethical
judgments
but
this
is
not
that
they
are
concerned
with
human
conduct
but
that
they
are
concerned
with
a
certain
predicate
good
and
its
converse
bad
which
may
be
applied
both
to
conduct
and
to
other
things
the
subjects
of
the
judgments
of
a
scientific
ethics
are
not
like
those
of
some
studies
particular
things
but
it
includes
all
judgments
which
assert
the
relation
of
goodness
to
any
subject
and
hence
includes
casuistry
b
it
must
however
enquire
not
only
what
things
are
universally
related
to
goodness
but
also
what
this
predicate
to
which
they
are
related
is
and
the
answer
to
this
question
is
that
it
is
indefinable
or
simple
for
if
by
definition
be
meant
the
analysis
of
an
object
of
thought
only
complex
objects
can
be
defined
and
of
the
three
senses
in
which
definition
can
be
used
this
is
the
most
important
what
is
thus
indefinable
is
not
the
good
or
the
whole
of
that
which
always
possesses
the
predicate
good
but
this
predicate
itself
good
then
denotes
one
unique
simple
object
of
thought
among
innumerable
others
but
this
object
has
very
commonly
been
identified
with
some
other
a
fallacy
which
may
be
called
the
naturalistic
fallacy
and
which
reduces
what
is
used
as
a
fundamental
principle
of
ethics
either
to
a
tautology
or
to
a
statement
about
the
meaning
of
a
word
the
nature
of
this
fallacy
is
easily
recognised
and
if
it
were
avoided
it
would
be
plain
that
the
only
alternatives
to
the
admission
that
good
is
indefinable
are
either
that
it
is
complex
or
that
there
is
no
notion
at
all
peculiar
to
ethics
alternatives
which
can
only
be
refuted
by
an
appeal
to
inspection
but
which
can
be
so
refuted
the
naturalistic
fallacy
illustrated
by
bentham
and
the
importance
of
avoiding
it
pointed
out
the
relations
which
ethical
judgments
assert
to
hold
universally
between
goodness
and
other
things
are
of
two
kinds
a
thing
may
be
asserted
either
to
good
itself
or
to
be
causally
related
to
something
else
which
is
itself
good
to
be
good
as
a
our
investigations
of
the
latter
kind
of
relation
can
not
hope
to
establish
more
than
that
a
certain
kind
of
action
will
be
followed
by
the
best
possible
results
but
a
relation
of
the
former
kind
if
true
at
all
will
be
true
of
all
cases
all
ordinary
ethical
judgments
assert
relations
but
they
are
commonly
treated
as
if
they
did
not
because
the
two
kinds
of
relation
are
not
distinguished
the
investigation
of
intrinsic
values
is
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
value
of
a
whole
may
be
different
from
the
sum
of
the
values
of
its
parts
in
which
case
the
part
has
to
the
whole
a
relation
which
exhibits
an
equally
important
difference
from
and
resemblance
to
that
of
means
to
end
the
term
organic
whole
might
well
be
used
to
denote
that
a
whole
has
this
property
since
of
the
two
other
properties
which
it
is
commonly
used
to
imply
one
that
of
reciprocal
causal
dependence
between
parts
has
no
necessary
relation
to
this
one
and
the
other
upon
which
most
stress
has
been
laid

be
true
of
no
whole
whatsoever

chapter
ii

ethics
this
and
the
two
following
chapters
will
consider
certain
proposed
answers
to
the
second
of
ethical
questions
what
is
in
these
proposed
answers
are
characterised
by
the
facts
that
they
declare
some
kind
of
thing
to
be
alone
good
in
itself
and
that
they
do
so
because
they
suppose
this
thing
to
define
the
meaning
of
such
theories
may
be
divided
into
two
groups
metaphysical
naturalistic
and
the
second
group
may
be
subdivided
into
two
others
theories
which
declare
some
natural
object
other
than
pleasure
to
be
sole
good
hedonism
the
present
chapter
will
deal
with
definition
of
what
is
meant
by
the
common
argument
that
things
are
good
because
they
are
natural
may
involve
either
the
false
proposition
that
the
normal
as
such
is
good
or
the
false
proposition
that
the
necessary
as
such
is
good
but
a
appeal
to
nature
is
now
most
prevalent
in
connection
with
the
term
an
examination
of
mr
herbert
spencer
s
ethics
will
illustrate
this
form
of
naturalism
darwin
s
scientific
theory
of
natural
selection
which
has
mainly
caused
the
modern
vogue
of
the
term
evolution
must
be
carefully
distinguished
from
certain
ideas
which
are
commonly
associated
with
the
latter
term
mr
spencer
s
connection
of
evolution
with
ethics
seems
to
shew
the
influence
of
the
naturalistic
fallacy
but
mr
spencer
is
vague
as
to
the
ethical
relations
of
pleasure
and
evolution
and
his
naturalism
may
be
mainly
naturalistic
hedonism
a
discussion
of
the
third
chapter
of
the
of
serves
to
illustrate

hedonism
the
prevalence
of
hedonism
is
mainly
due
to
the
naturalistic
fallacy
hedonism
may
be
defined
as
the
doctrine
that
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
this
doctrine
has
always
been
held
by
hedonists
and
used
by
them
as
a
fundamental
ethical
principle
although
it
has
commonly
been
confused
with
others
the
method
pursued
in
this
chapter
will
consist
in
exposing
the
reasons
commonly
offered
for
the
truth
of
hedonism
and
in
bringing
out
the
reasons
which
suffice
to
shew
it
untrue
by
a
criticism
of
mill
sidgwick
a
mill
declares
that
happiness
is
the
only
thing
desirable
as
an
end
and
insists
that
questions
of
ultimate
ends
are
not
amenable
to
direct
proof
yet
he
gives
a
proof
of
the
first
proposition
which
consists
in
the
fallacious
confusion
of
desirable
with
desired
an
attempt
to
shew
that
nothing
but
pleasure
is
desired
the
theory
that
nothing
but
pleasure
is
desired
seems
largely
due
to
a
confusion
between
the
and
the
of
desire
pleasure
is
certainly
not
the
sole
of
desire
and
even
if
it
is
always
among
the
of
desire
that
fact
would
not
tempt
anyone
to
think
it
a
good
mill
attempts
to
reconcile
his
doctrine
that
pleasure
is
the
sole
object
of
desire
with
his
admission
that
other
things
are
desired
by
the
absurd
declaration
that
what
is
a
means
to
happiness
is
part
of
happiness
summary
of
mill
s
argument
and
of
my
criticism
b
we
must
now
proceed
to
consider
the
principle
of
hedonism
as
an
intuition
as
which
it
has
been
clearly
recognised
by
sidgwick
alone
that
it
should
be
thus
incapable
of
is
not
in
itself
any
reason
for
dissatisfaction
in
thus
beginning
to
consider
what
things
are
good
in
themselves
we
leave
the
refutation
of
naturalism
behind
and
enter
on
the
second
division
of
ethical
questions
mill
s
doctrine
that
some
pleasures
are
superior
in
quality
to
others
implies
both
that
judgments
of
ends
must
be
intuitions
and
that
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
sidgwick
has
avoided
these
confusions
made
by
mill
in
considering
his
arguments
we
shall
therefore
merely
consider
the
question
is
pleasure
the
sole
good
sidgwick
first
tries
to
shew
that
nothing
outside
of
human
existence
can
be
good
reasons
are
given
for
doubting
this
he
then
goes
on
to
the
far
more
important
proposition
that
no
part
of
human
existence
except
pleasure
is
desirable
but
must
be
distinguished
from
of
and
it
is
plain
that
when
so
distinguished
is
not
the
sole
good
and
it
may
be
made
equally
plain
that
of
is
not
the
sole
good
if
we
are
equally
careful
to
distinguish
it
from
its
usual
accompaniments
of
sidgwick
s
two
arguments
for
the
contrary
view
the
second
is
equally
compatible
with
the
supposition
that
pleasure
is
a
mere
of
what
is
and
in
his
first
the
appeal
to
reflective
intuition
he
fails
to
put
the
question
clearly
in
that
he
does
not
recognise
the
principle
of
and
in
that
he
fails
to
emphasize
that
the
agreement
which
he
has
tried
to
shew
between
hedonistic
judgments
and
those
of
common
sense
only
holds
of
of
hedonistic
judgments
of
are
flagrantly
paradoxical
i
conclude
then
that
a
reflective
intuition
if
proper
precautions
are
taken
will
agree
with
common
sense
that
it
is
absurd
to
regard
mere
consciousness
of
pleasure
as
the
sole
good
it
remains
to
consider
egoism
and
utilitarianism
it
is
important
to
distinguish
the
former
as
the
doctrine
that
my
own
pleasure
is
sole
good
from
the
doctrine
opposed
to
altruism
that
to
pursue
my
own
pleasure
exclusively
is
right
a
egoism
proper
is
utterly
untenable
being
it
fails
to
perceive
that
when
i
declare
a
thing
to
be
my
own
good
i
must
be
declaring
it
to
be
or
else
not
good
at
all
this
confusion
is
further
brought
out
by
an
examination
of
sidgwick
s
contrary
view
and
it
is
shewn
that
in
consequence
of
this
confusion
his
representation
of
the
relation
of
rational
egoism
to
rational
benevolence
as
the
profoundest
problem
of
ethics
and
his
view
that
a
certain
hypothesis
is
required
to
make
ethics
rational
are
grossly
erroneous
the
same
confusion
is
involved
in
the
attempt
to
infer
utilitarianism
from
psychological
hedonism
as
commonly
held
by
mill
egoism
proper
seems
also
to
owe
its
plausibility
to
its
confusion
with
egoism
as
a
doctrine
of
means
certain
ambiguities
in
the
conception
of
utilitarianism
are
noticed
and
it
is
pointed
out
that
as
a
doctrine
of
the
end
to
be
pursued
it
is
finally
refuted
by
the
refutation
of
hedonism
and
that
while
the
arguments
most
commonly
urged
in
its
favour
could
at
most
only
shew
it
to
offer
a
correct
of
right
action
they
are
quite
insufficient
even
for
this
purpose
summary
of

chapter
iv
metaphysical
ethics
a
the
term
metaphysical
is
defined
as
having
reference
primarily
to
any
object
of
knowledge
which
is
not
a
part
of
nature
does
not
exist
in
time
as
an
object
of
perception
but
since
metaphysicians
not
content
with
pointing
out
the
truth
about
such
entities
have
always
supposed
that
what
does
not
exist
in
nature
must
at
least
the
term
also
has
reference
to
a
supposed
supersensible
reality
and
by
metaphysical
ethics
i
mean
those
systems
which
maintain
or
imply
that
the
answer
to
the
question
what
is
good
upon
the
answer
to
the
question
what
is
the
nature
of
supersensible
reality
all
such
systems
obviously
involve
the
same
fallacy
the
naturalistic
fallacy
by
the
use
of
which
naturalism
was
also
defined
metaphysics
as
dealing
with
a
supersensible
reality
may
have
a
bearing
upon
ethics
if
its
supersensible
reality
is
conceived
as
something
future
which
our
actions
can
affect
and
since
it
will
prove
that
proposition
of
practical
ethics
is
false
if
it
can
shew
that
an
eternal
reality
is
either
the
only
real
thing
or
the
only
good
thing
most
metaphysical
writers
believing
in
a
reality
of
the
latter
kind
do
thus
imply
the
complete
falsehood
of
every
practical
proposition
although
they
fail
to
see
that
their
metaphysics
thus
contradicts
their
ethics
b
but
the
theory
by
which
i
have
defined
metaphysical
ethics
is
that
metaphysics
has
a
logical
bearing
upon
the
question
involved
in
ethics
what
effects
will
my
action
produce
but
that
it
has
such
a
bearing
upon
the
fundamental
ethical
question
what
is
good
in
itself
this
theory
has
been
refuted
by
the
proof
in
chap
i
that
the
naturalistic
fallacy
is
a
fallacy
it
only
remains
to
discuss
certain
confusions
which
seem
to
have
lent
it
plausibility
one
such
source
of
confusion
seems
to
lie
in
the
failure
to
distinguish
between
the
proposition
this
is
good
when
it
means
this
thing
is
good
and
the
same
proposition
when
it
means
the
existence
of
this
of
thing
would
be
good
and
another
seems
to
lie
in
the
failure
to
distinguish
between
that
which
a
truth
or
is
a
of
our
knowing
it
and
that
upon
which
it
depends
or
which
is
a
for
believing
it
in
the
former
sense
fiction
has
a
more
important
bearing
upon
ethics
than
metaphysics
can
have
but
a
more
important
source
of
confusion
seems
to
lie
in
the
supposition
that
to
be
good
is
with
the
possession
of
some
supersensible
property
which
is
also
involved
in
the
definition
of
one
cause
of
this
supposition
seems
to
be
the
logical
prejudice
that
all
propositions
are
of
the
most
familiar
type
that
in
which
subject
and
predicate
are
both
existents
but
ethical
propositions
can
not
be
reduced
to
this
type
in
particular
they
are
obviously
to
be
distinguished
from
natural
laws
with
which
one
of
kant
s
most
famous
doctrines
confuses
them
and
from
commands
with
which
they
are
confused
both
by
kant
and
by
others
this
latter
confusion
is
one
of
the
sources
of
the
prevalent
modern
doctrine
that
being
good
is
with
being
willed
but
the
prevalence
of
this
doctrine
seems
to
be
chiefly
due
to
other
causes
i
shall
try
to
shew
with
regard
to
it
what
are
the
chief
errors
which
seem
to
have
led
to
its
adoption
and
that
apart
from
it
the
metaphysics
of
volition
can
hardly
have
the
smallest
logical
bearing
upon
ethics
it
has
been
commonly
held
since
kant
that
goodness
has
the
same
relation
to
will
or
feeling
which
truth
or
reality
has
to
cognition
that
the
proper
method
for
ethics
is
to
discover
what
is
in
will
or
feeling
just
as
according
to
kant
the
proper
method
for
metaphysics
was
to
discover
what
is
in
cognition
the
actual
relations
between
goodness
and
will
or
feeling
from
which
this
false
doctrine
is
inferred
seem
to
be
mainly
the
relation
consisting
in
the
fact
that
it
is
only
by
reflection
upon
the
experiences
of
will
and
feeling
that
we
become
aware
of
ethical
distinctions
the
facts
that
a
cognition
of
goodness
is
perhaps
included
in
certain
kinds
of
willing
and
feeling
and
is
accompanied
by
them
but
from
neither
of
these
facts
does
it
follow
that
to
be
good
is
identical
with
being
willed
or
felt
in
a
certain
way
the
supposition
that
it
does
follow
is
an
instance
of
the
fundamental
contradiction
of
modern
epistemology
the
contradiction
involved
in
both
distinguishing
and
identifying
the
and
the
of
thought
truth
itself
and
its
supposed
and
once
this
analogy
between
volition
and
cognition
is
accepted
the
view
that
ethical
propositions
have
an
essential
reference
to
will
or
feeling
is
strengthened
by
another
error
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
cognition
the
error
of
supposing
that
perception
denotes
a
certain
way
of
cognising
an
object
whereas
it
actually
includes
the
assertion
that
the
object
is
also
the
argument
of
the
last
three
is
recapitulated
and
it
is
pointed
out
that
volition
and
feeling
are
analogous
to
cognition
that
even
if
they
were
still
to
be
good
could
not
to
be
willed
or
felt
in
a
certain
if
being
good
and
being
willed
are
not
then
the
latter
could
only
be
a
of
the
former
and
in
order
to
shew
that
it
was
so
we
should
have
to
establish
that
many
things
were
good
that
is
to
say
we
should
have
to
establish
most
of
our
ethical
conclusions
before
the
metaphysics
of
volition
could
possibly
give
us
the
smallest
assistance
the
fact
that
the
metaphysical
writers
who
like
green
attempt
to
ethics
on
volition
do
not
even
attempt
this
independent
investigation
shews
that
they
start
from
the
false
assumption
that
goodness
is
with
being
willed
and
hence
that
their
ethical
reasonings
have
no
value
whatsoever
summary
of
chapter
chapter
ethics
in
relation
to
conduct
the
question
to
be
discussed
in
this
chapter
must
be
clearly
distinguished
from
the
two
questions
hitherto
discussed
namely
what
is
the
nature
of
the
proposition
this
is
good
in
itself
and
what
things
are
good
in
themselves
to
which
we
gave
one
answer
in
deciding
that
pleasure
was
not
the
only
thing
good
in
itself
in
this
chapter
we
shall
deal
with
the
object
of
ethical
enquiry
namely
answers
to
the
question
what
conduct
is
a
to
good
results
or
what
ought
we
to
do
this
is
the
question
of
ethics
and
its
answer
involves
an
assertion
of
connection
it
is
shewn
that
the
assertions
this
action
is
right
or
is
my
duty
are
equivalent
to
the
assertion
that
the
total
results
of
the
action
in
question
will
be
the
best
possible
and
the
rest
of
the
chapter
will
deal
with
certain
conclusions
upon
which
light
is
thrown
by
this
fact
of
which
the
first
is
that
intuitionism
is
mistaken
since
no
proposition
with
regard
to
duty
can
be
it
is
plain
that
we
can
not
hope
to
prove
which
among
all
the
actions
which
it
is
possible
for
us
to
perform
on
every
occasion
will
produce
the
best
total
results
to
discover
what
is
our
duty
in
this
strict
sense
is
impossible
it
may
however
be
possible
to
shew
which
among
the
actions
which
we
are
to
perform
will
produce
the
best
results
the
distinction
made
in
the
last
is
further
explained
and
it
is
insisted
that
all
that
ethics
has
done
or
can
do
is
to
determine
absolute
duties
but
to
point
out
which
among
a
of
the
alternatives
possible
under
circumstances
will
have
the
better
results
even
this
latter
task
is
immensely
difficult
and
no
adequate
proof
that
the
total
results
of
one
action
are
superior
to
those
of
another
has
ever
been
given
for
we
can
only
calculate
actual
results
within
a
comparatively
near
future
we
must
therefore
assume
that
no
results
of
the
same
action
in
the
infinite
future
beyond
will
reverse
the
balance
an
assumption
which
perhaps
be
but
certainly
has
not
been
justified
and
even
to
decide
that
of
any
two
actions
one
has
a
better
total
result
than
the
other
the
immediate
is
very
difficult
and
it
is
very
improbable
and
quite
impossible
to
prove
that
any
single
action
is
all
better
as
means
than
its
probable
alternative
rules
of
duty
even
in
this
restricted
sense
can
only
at
most
be
truths
but
most
of
the
actions
most
universally
approved
by
common
sense
may
perhaps
be
shewn
to
be
better
as
means
than
any
probable
alternative
on
the
following
principles
with
regard
to
some
rules
it
may
be
shewn
that
their
general
observance
would
be
useful
in
any
state
of
society
where
the
instincts
to
preserve
and
propagate
life
and
to
possess
property
were
as
strong
as
they
seem
always
to
be
and
this
utility
may
be
shewn
independently
of
a
right
view
as
to
what
is
good
in
itself
since
the
observance
is
a
means
to
things
which
are
a
necessary
condition
for
the
attainment
of
great
goods
in
considerable
quantities
other
rules
are
such
that
their
general
observance
can
only
be
shewn
to
be
useful
as
means
to
the
preservation
of
society
under
more
or
less
temporary
conditions
if
any
of
these
are
to
be
proved
useful
in
societies
this
can
only
be
done
by
shewing
their
causal
relation
to
things
good
or
evil
in
themselves
which
are
not
generally
recognised
to
be
such
it
is
plain
that
rules
of
class
may
be
justified
by
the
existence
of
such
temporary
conditions
as
justify
those
of
class
and
among
such
temporary
conditions
must
be
reckoned
the
in
this
way
then
it
may
be
possible
to
prove
the
utility
for
the
present
of
those
actions
which
in
our
society
are
generally
recognised
as
duties
generally
practised
but
it
seems
very
doubtful
whether
a
conclusive
case
can
be
established
for
any
proposed
change
in
social
custom
without
an
independent
investigation
of
what
things
are
good
or
bad
in
themselves
and
if
we
consider
the
distinct
question
of
how
a
single
individual
should
decide
to
act
α
in
cases
where
the
utility
of
the
action
in
question
is
certain
β
in
other
cases
there
seems
reason
for
thinking
that
with
regard
to
α
where
the
generally
useful
rule
is
also
generally
observed
he
should
conform
to
it
but
these
reasons
are
not
conclusive
if
the
general
observance
the
general
utility
is
wanting
and
that
β
in
all
other
cases
of
should
not
be
followed
at
all
but
the
individual
should
consider
what
positive
goods
in
his
particular
circumstances
seems
likely
to
be
able
to
effect
and
what
evils
to
avoid
it
follows
further
that
the
distinction
denoted
by
the
terms
duty
and
expediency
is
not
primarily
ethical
when
we
ask
is
this
really
expedient
we
are
asking
precisely
the
same
question
as
when
we
ask
is
this
my
duty
viz
is
this
a
means
to
the
best
possible
duties
are
mainly
distinguished
by
the
marks
that
many
people
are
often
tempted
to
avoid
them
that
their
most
prominent
effects
are
on
others
than
the
agent
that
they
excite
the
moral
sentiments
so
far
as
they
distinguished
by
an
ethical
peculiarity
this
is
not
that
they
are
peculiarly
useful
to
perform
but
that
they
are
peculiarly
useful
to
sanction
the
distinction
between
duty
and
interest
is
also
in
the
main
the
same
distinction
but
the
term
interested
does
also
refer
to
a
distinct
ethical
predicate
that
an
action
is
to
my
interest
asserts
only
that
it
will
have
the
best
possible
effects
of
one
particular
kind
not
that
its
total
effects
will
be
the
best
possible
we
may
further
see
that
virtues
are
not
to
be
defined
as
dispositions
that
are
good
in
themselves
they
are
not
necessarily
more
than
dispositions
to
perform
actions
generally
good
as
means
and
of
these
for
the
most
part
only
those
classed
as
duties
in
accordance
with
section
it
follows
that
to
decide
whether
a
disposition
is
or
is
not
virtuous
involves
the
difficult
causal
investigation
discussed
in
section
and
that
what
is
a
virtue
in
one
state
of
society
may
not
be
so
in
another
it
follows
also
that
we
have
no
reason
to
presume
as
has
commonly
been
done
that
the
exercise
of
virtue
in
the
performance
of
duties
is
ever
good
in
itself
far
less
that
it
is
the
sole
good
and
if
we
consider
the
intrinsic
value
of
such
exercise
it
will
appear
that
in
most
cases
it
has
no
value
and
that
even
the
cases
where
it
has
some
value
are
far
from
constituting
the
sole
good
the
truth
of
the
latter
proposition
is
generally
inconsistently
implied
even
by
those
who
deny
it
but
in
order
fairly
to
decide
upon
the
intrinsic
value
of
virtue
we
must
distinguish
three
different
kinds
of
disposition
each
of
which
is
commonly
so
called
and
has
been
maintained
to
be
the
only
kind
deserving
the
name
thus
the
mere
unconscious
habit
of
performing
duties
which
is
the
commonest
type
has
no
intrinsic
value
whatsoever
christian
moralists
are
right
in
implying
that
mere
external
rightness
has
no
intrinsic
value
though
they
are
wrong
in
saying
that
it
is
therefore
not
virtuous
since
this
implies
that
it
has
no
value
even
as
a
means
where
virtue
consists
in
a
disposition
to
have
and
be
moved
by
a
sentiment
of
love
towards
really
good
consequences
of
an
action
and
of
hatred
towards
really
evil
ones
it
has
some
intrinsic
value
but
its
value
may
vary
greatly
in
degree
finally
where
virtue
consists
in
conscientiousness
the
disposition
not
to
act
in
certain
cases
until
we
believe
and
feel
that
our
action
is
right
it
seems
to
have
some
intrinsic
value
the
value
of
this
feeling
has
been
peculiarly
emphasized
by
christian
ethics
but
it
certainly
is
not
as
kant
would
lead
us
to
think
either
the
sole
thing
of
value
or
always
good
even
as
a
means

the
ideal
by
an
ideal
state
of
things
may
be
meant
either
the
summum
bonum
or
absolutely
best
or
the
best
which
the
laws
of
nature
allow
to
exist
in
this
world
or
anything
greatly
good
in
itself
this
chapter
will
be
principally
occupied
with
what
is
ideal
in
sense
with
answering
the
fundamental
question
of
ethics
but
a
correct
answer
to
this
question
is
an
essential
step
towards
a
correct
view
as
to
what
is
ideal
in
senses
and
in
order
to
obtain
a
correct
answer
to
the
question
what
is
good
in
itself
we
must
consider
what
value
things
would
have
if
they
existed
absolutely
by
themselves
and
if
we
use
this
method
it
is
obvious
that
personal
affection
and
aesthetic
enjoyments
include
by
far
the
greatest
goods
with
which
we
are
acquainted
if
we
begin
by
considering
i
it
is
plain
that
there
is
always
to
these
some
one
of
a
great
variety
of
different
emotions
though
these
emotions
may
have
little
value
and
that
a
cognition
of
really
beautiful
qualities
is
equally
essential
and
has
equally
little
value
by
itself
but
granted
that
the
appropriate
combination
of
these
two
elements
is
always
a
considerable
good
and
may
be
a
very
great
one
we
may
ask
whether
where
there
is
to
this
true
belief
in
the
existence
of
the
object
of
the
the
whole
thus
formed
is
not
much
more
valuable
still
i
think
that
this
question
should
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
but
in
order
to
ensure
that
this
judgment
is
correct
we
must
carefully
distinguish
it
from
the
two
judgments
that
knowledge
is
valuable
a
that
where
the
object
of
the
cognition
is
itself
a
good
thing
its
existence
of
course
adds
to
the
value
of
the
whole
state
of
things
if
however
we
attempt
to
avoid
being
biassed
by
these
two
facts
it
still
seems
that
mere
true
belief
may
be
a
condition
essential
to
great
value
we
thus
get
a
essential
constituent
of
many
great
goods
and
in
this
way
we
are
able
to
justify
the
attribution
of
value
to
over
and
above
its
value
as
a
means
and
the
intrinsic
superiority
of
the
proper
appreciation
of
a
object
over
the
appreciation
of
an
equally
valuable
object
of
mere
imagination
emotions
directed
towards
real
objects
may
thus
even
if
the
object
be
inferior
claim
equality
with
the
highest
imaginative
pleasures
finally
with
regard
to
the
of
the
cognition
which
is
essential
to
these
good
wholes
it
is
the
business
of
aesthetics
to
analyse
their
nature
it
need
only
be
here
remarked
that
by
calling
them
beautiful
we
mean
that
they
have
this
relation
to
a
whole
and
that
they
are
for
the
most
part
themselves
complex
wholes
such
that
the
admiring
contemplation
of
the
whole
greatly
exceeds
in
value
the
sum
of
the
values
of
the
admiring
contemplation
of
the
parts
with
regard
to
ii
the
object
is
here
not
merely
beautiful
but
also
good
in
itself
it
appears
however
that
the
appreciation
of
what
is
thus
good
in
itself
viz
the
mental
qualities
of
a
person
is
certainly
by
itself
not
so
great
a
good
as
the
whole
formed
by
the
combination
with
it
of
an
appreciation
of
corporeal
beauty
it
is
doubtful
whether
it
is
even
so
great
a
good
as
the
mere
appreciation
of
corporeal
beauty
but
it
is
certain
that
the
combination
of
both
is
a
far
greater
good
than
either
singly
it
follows
from
what
has
been
said
that
we
have
every
reason
to
suppose
that
a
cognition
of
and
even
their
existence
is
an
essential
constituent
of
the
ideal
or
summum
bonum
there
is
only
a
bare
possibility
that
they
are
not
included
in
it
it
remains
to
consider
and
i
may
be
divided
into
three
classes
namely
evils
which
consist
in
the
love
or
admiration
or
enjoyment
of
what
is
evil
or
ugly
evils
which
consist
in
the
hatred
or
contempt
of
what
is
good
or
beautiful
and
the
consciousness
of
intense
pain
this
appears
to
be
the
only
thing
either
greatly
good
or
greatly
evil
which
does
not
involve
a
cognition
an
emotion
directed
towards
its
object
and
hence
it
is
not
analogous
to
pleasure
in
respect
of
its
intrinsic
value
while
it
also
seems
not
to
add
to
the
vileness
of
a
whole
a
in
which
it
is
combined
with
another
bad
thing
whereas
pleasure
does
add
to
the
goodness
of
a
whole
in
which
it
is
combined
with
another
good
thing
but
pleasure
and
pain
are
completely
analogous
in
this
that
pleasure
by
no
means
always
increases
and
pain
by
no
means
always
decreases
the
total
value
of
a
whole
in
which
it
is
included
the
converse
is
often
true
in
order
to
consider
ii
we
must
first
distinguish
between
the
value
of
a
whole
a
and
its
value
the
or
total
value
the
difference
between
and
the
sum
of
the
values
of
the
parts
in
view
of
this
distinction
it
then
appears
that
the
mere
combination
of
two
or
more
evils
is
never
positively
good
the
although
it
may
certainly
have
great
intrinsic
value
a
but
that
a
whole
which
includes
a
cognition
of
something
evil
or
ugly
may
yet
be
a
great
positive
good
the
most
virtues
which
have
any
intrinsic
value
whatever
seem
to
be
of
this
kind
courage
and
compassion
and
moral
goodness
all
these
are
instances
of
the
hatred
or
contempt
of
what
is
evil
or
ugly
but
there
seems
no
reason
to
think
that
where
the
evil
object
the
total
state
of
things
is
ever
positively
good
the
although
the
existence
of
the
evil
may
add
to
its
value
a
hence
no
actually
existing
evil
is
necessary
to
the
ideal
the
contemplation
of
imaginary
evils
is
necessary
to
it
and
where
evils
already
exist
the
existence
of
mixed
virtues
has
a
value
independent
both
of
its
consequences
and
of
the
value
which
it
has
in
common
with
the
proper
appreciation
of
imaginary
evils
concluding
remarks
summary
of
chapter
chapter
i
the
of
ethics
it
is
very
easy
to
point
out
some
among
our
judgments
with
the
truth
of
which
ethics
is
undoubtedly
concerned
whenever
we
say
so
and
so
is
a
good
man
or
that
fellow
is
a
villain
whenever
we
ask
what
ought
i
to
do
or
is
it
wrong
for
me
to
do
like
this
whenever
we
hazard
such
remarks
as
temperance
is
a
virtue
and
drunkenness
a
vice
it
is
undoubtedly
the
business
of
ethics
to
discuss
such
questions
and
such
statements
to
argue
what
is
the
true
answer
when
we
ask
what
it
is
right
to
do
and
to
give
reasons
for
thinking
that
our
statements
about
the
character
of
persons
or
the
morality
of
actions
are
true
or
false
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
where
we
make
statements
involving
any
of
the
terms
virtue
vice
duty
right
ought
good
bad
we
are
making
ethical
judgments
and
if
we
wish
to
discuss
their
truth
we
shall
be
discussing
a
point
of
ethics
so
much
as
this
is
not
disputed
but
it
falls
very
far
short
of
defining
the
province
of
ethics
that
province
may
indeed
be
defined
as
the
whole
truth
about
that
which
is
at
the
same
time
common
to
all
such
judgments
and
peculiar
to
them
but
we
have
still
to
ask
the
question
what
is
it
that
is
thus
common
and
peculiar
and
this
is
a
question
to
which
very
different
answers
have
been
given
by
ethical
philosophers
of
acknowledged
reputation
and
none
of
them
perhaps
completely
satisfactory
if
we
take
such
examples
as
those
given
above
we
shall
not
be
far
wrong
in
saying
that
they
are
all
of
them
concerned
with
the
question
of
conduct
with
the
question
what
in
the
conduct
of
us
human
beings
is
good
and
what
is
bad
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
for
when
we
say
that
a
man
is
good
we
commonly
mean
that
he
acts
rightly
when
we
say
that
drunkenness
is
a
vice
we
commonly
mean
that
to
get
drunk
is
a
wrong
or
wicked
action
and
this
discussion
of
human
conduct
is
in
fact
that
with
which
the
name
ethics
is
most
intimately
associated
it
is
so
associated
by
derivation
and
conduct
is
undoubtedly
by
far
the
commonest
and
most
generally
interesting
object
of
ethical
judgments
accordingly
we
find
that
many
ethical
philosophers
are
disposed
to
accept
as
an
adequate
definition
of
ethics
the
statement
that
it
deals
with
the
question
what
is
good
or
bad
in
human
conduct
they
hold
that
its
enquiries
are
properly
confined
to
conduct
or
to
practice
they
hold
that
the
name
practical
philosophy
covers
all
the
matter
with
which
it
has
to
do
now
without
discussing
the
proper
meaning
of
the
word
for
verbal
questions
are
properly
left
to
the
writers
of
dictionaries
and
other
persons
interested
in
literature
philosophy
as
we
shall
see
has
no
concern
with
them
i
may
say
that
i
intend
to
use
ethics
to
cover
more
than
this
a
usage
for
which
there
is
i
think
quite
sufficient
authority
i
am
using
it
to
cover
an
enquiry
for
which
at
all
events
there
is
no
other
word
the
general
enquiry
into
what
is
good
ethics
is
undoubtedly
concerned
with
the
question
what
good
conduct
is
but
being
concerned
with
this
it
obviously
does
not
start
at
the
beginning
unless
it
is
prepared
to
tell
us
what
is
good
as
well
as
what
is
conduct
for
good
conduct
is
a
complex
notion
all
conduct
is
not
good
for
some
is
certainly
bad
and
some
may
be
indifferent
and
on
the
other
hand
other
things
beside
conduct
may
be
good
and
if
they
are
so
then
good
denotes
some
property
that
is
common
to
them
and
conduct
and
if
we
examine
good
conduct
alone
of
all
good
things
then
we
shall
be
in
danger
of
mistaking
for
this
property
some
property
which
is
not
shared
by
those
other
things
and
thus
we
shall
have
made
a
mistake
about
ethics
even
in
this
limited
sense
for
we
shall
not
know
what
good
conduct
really
is
this
is
a
mistake
which
many
writers
have
actually
made
from
limiting
their
enquiry
to
conduct
and
hence
i
shall
try
to
avoid
it
by
considering
first
what
is
good
in
general
hoping
that
if
we
can
arrive
at
any
certainty
about
this
it
will
be
much
easier
to
settle
the
question
of
good
conduct
for
we
all
know
pretty
well
what
conduct
is
this
then
is
our
first
question
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
and
to
the
discussion
of
this
question
of
these
questions
i
give
the
name
of
ethics
since
that
science
must
at
all
events
include
it
but
this
is
a
question
which
may
have
many
meanings
if
for
example
each
of
us
were
to
say
i
am
doing
good
now
or
i
had
a
good
dinner
yesterday
these
statements
would
each
of
them
be
some
sort
of
answer
to
our
question
although
perhaps
a
false
one
so
too
when
a
asks
b
what
school
he
ought
to
send
his
son
to
b
s
answer
will
certainly
be
an
ethical
judgment
and
similarly
all
distribution
of
praise
or
blame
to
any
personage
or
thing
that
has
existed
now
exists
or
will
exist
does
give
some
answer
to
the
question
what
is
good
in
all
such
cases
some
particular
thing
is
judged
to
be
good
or
bad
the
question
what
is
answered
by
but
this
is
not
the
sense
in
which
a
scientific
ethics
asks
the
question
not
one
of
all
the
many
million
answers
of
this
kind
which
must
be
true
can
form
a
part
of
an
ethical
system
although
that
science
must
contain
reasons
and
principles
sufficient
for
deciding
on
the
truth
of
all
of
them
there
are
far
too
many
persons
things
and
events
in
the
world
past
present
or
to
come
for
a
discussion
of
their
individual
merits
to
be
embraced
in
any
science
ethics
therefore
does
not
deal
at
all
with
facts
of
this
nature
facts
that
are
unique
individual
absolutely
particular
facts
with
which
such
studies
as
history
geography
astronomy
are
compelled
in
part
at
least
to
deal
and
for
this
reason
it
is
not
the
business
of
the
ethical
philosopher
to
give
personal
advice
or
exhortation
but
there
is
another
meaning
which
may
be
given
to
the
question
what
is
good
books
are
good
would
be
an
answer
to
it
though
an
answer
obviously
false
for
some
books
are
very
bad
indeed
and
ethical
judgments
of
this
kind
do
indeed
belong
to
ethics
though
i
shall
not
deal
with
many
of
them
such
is
the
judgment
pleasure
is
good
a
judgment
of
which
ethics
should
discuss
the
truth
although
it
is
not
nearly
as
important
as
that
other
judgment
with
which
we
shall
be
much
occupied
presently
pleasure
is
it
is
judgments
of
this
sort
which
are
made
in
such
books
on
ethics
as
contain
a
list
of
virtues
in
aristotle
s
ethics
for
example
but
it
is
judgments
of
precisely
the
same
kind
which
form
the
substance
of
what
is
commonly
supposed
to
be
a
study
different
from
ethics
and
one
much
less
respectable
the
study
of
casuistry
we
may
be
told
that
casuistry
differs
from
ethics
in
that
it
is
much
more
detailed
and
particular
ethics
much
more
general
but
it
is
most
important
to
notice
that
casuistry
does
not
deal
with
anything
that
is
absolutely
particular
particular
in
the
only
sense
in
which
a
perfectly
precise
line
can
be
drawn
between
it
and
what
is
general
it
is
not
particular
in
the
sense
just
noticed
the
sense
in
which
this
book
is
a
particular
book
and
a
s
friend
s
advice
particular
advice
casuistry
may
indeed
be
particular
and
ethics
general
but
that
means
that
they
differ
only
in
degree
and
not
in
kind
and
this
is
universally
true
of
particular
and
general
when
used
in
this
common
but
inaccurate
sense
so
far
as
ethics
allows
itself
to
give
lists
of
virtues
or
even
to
name
constituents
of
the
ideal
it
is
indistinguishable
from
casuistry
both
alike
deal
with
what
is
general
in
the
sense
in
which
physics
and
chemistry
deal
with
what
is
general
just
as
chemistry
aims
at
discovering
what
are
the
properties
of
oxygen
it
and
not
only
of
this
or
that
particular
specimen
of
oxygen
so
casuistry
aims
at
discovering
what
actions
are
good
they
in
this
respect
ethics
and
casuistry
alike
are
to
be
classed
with
such
sciences
as
physics
chemistry
and
physiology
in
their
absolute
distinction
from
those
of
which
history
and
geography
are
instances
and
it
is
to
be
noted
that
owing
to
their
detailed
nature
casuistical
investigations
are
actually
nearer
to
physics
and
to
chemistry
than
are
the
investigations
usually
assigned
to
ethics
for
just
as
physics
can
not
rest
content
with
the
discovery
that
light
is
propagated
by
waves
of
ether
but
must
go
on
to
discover
the
particular
nature
of
the
corresponding
to
each
several
colour
so
casuistry
not
content
with
the
general
law
that
charity
is
a
virtue
must
attempt
to
discover
the
relative
merits
of
every
different
form
of
charity
casuistry
forms
therefore
part
of
the
ideal
of
ethical
science
ethics
can
not
be
complete
without
it
the
defects
of
casuistry
are
not
defects
of
principle
no
objection
can
be
taken
to
its
aim
and
object
it
has
failed
only
because
it
is
far
too
difficult
a
subject
to
be
treated
adequately
in
our
present
state
of
knowledge
the
casuist
has
been
unable
to
distinguish
in
the
cases
which
he
treats
those
elements
upon
which
their
value
depends
hence
he
often
thinks
two
cases
to
be
alike
in
respect
of
value
when
in
reality
they
are
alike
only
in
some
other
respect
it
is
to
mistakes
of
this
kind
that
the
pernicious
influence
of
such
investigations
has
been
due
for
casuistry
is
the
goal
of
ethical
investigation
it
can
not
be
safely
attempted
at
the
beginning
of
our
studies
but
only
at
the
end
but
our
question
what
is
good
may
have
still
another
meaning
we
may
in
the
third
place
mean
to
ask
not
what
thing
or
things
are
good
but
how
good
is
to
be
defined
this
is
an
enquiry
which
belongs
only
to
ethics
not
to
casuistry
and
this
is
the
enquiry
which
will
occupy
us
first
it
is
an
enquiry
to
which
most
special
attention
should
be
directed
since
this
question
how
good
is
to
be
defined
is
the
most
fundamental
question
in
all
ethics
that
which
is
meant
by
good
is
in
fact
except
its
converse
bad
the
simple
object
of
thought
which
is
peculiar
to
ethics
its
definition
is
therefore
the
most
essential
point
in
the
definition
of
ethics
and
moreover
a
mistake
with
regard
to
it
entails
a
far
larger
number
of
erroneous
ethical
judgments
than
any
other
unless
this
first
question
be
fully
understood
and
its
true
answer
clearly
recognised
the
rest
of
ethics
is
as
good
as
useless
from
the
point
of
view
of
systematic
knowledge
true
ethical
judgments
of
the
two
kinds
last
dealt
with
may
indeed
be
made
by
those
who
do
not
know
the
answer
to
this
question
as
well
as
by
those
who
do
and
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
two
classes
of
people
may
lead
equally
good
lives
but
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
the
ethical
judgments
will
be
equally
valid
in
the
absence
of
a
true
answer
to
this
question
i
shall
presently
try
to
shew
that
the
gravest
errors
have
been
largely
due
to
beliefs
in
a
false
answer
and
in
any
case
it
is
impossible
that
till
the
answer
to
this
question
be
known
any
one
should
know
is
the
for
any
ethical
judgment
whatsoever
but
the
main
object
of
ethics
as
a
systematic
science
is
to
give
correct
for
thinking
that
this
or
that
is
good
and
unless
this
question
be
answered
such
reasons
can
not
be
given
even
therefore
apart
from
the
fact
that
a
false
answer
leads
to
false
conclusions
the
present
enquiry
is
a
most
necessary
and
important
part
of
the
science
of
ethics
what
then
is
good
how
is
good
to
be
defined
now
it
may
be
thought
that
this
is
a
verbal
question
a
definition
does
indeed
often
mean
the
expressing
of
one
word
s
meaning
in
other
words
but
this
is
not
the
sort
of
definition
i
am
asking
for
such
a
definition
can
never
be
of
ultimate
importance
in
any
study
except
lexicography
if
i
wanted
that
kind
of
definition
i
should
have
to
consider
in
the
first
place
how
people
generally
used
the
word
good
but
my
business
is
not
with
its
proper
usage
as
established
by
custom
i
should
indeed
be
foolish
if
i
tried
to
use
it
for
something
which
it
did
not
usually
denote
if
for
instance
i
were
to
announce
that
whenever
i
used
the
word
good
i
must
be
understood
to
be
thinking
of
that
object
which
is
usually
denoted
by
the
word
i
shall
therefore
use
the
word
in
the
sense
in
which
i
think
it
is
ordinarily
used
but
at
the
same
time
i
am
not
anxious
to
discuss
whether
i
am
right
in
thinking
that
it
is
so
used
my
business
is
solely
with
that
object
or
idea
which
i
hold
rightly
or
wrongly
that
the
word
is
generally
used
to
stand
for
what
i
want
to
discover
is
the
nature
of
that
object
or
idea
and
about
this
i
am
extremely
anxious
to
arrive
at
an
agreement
but
if
we
understand
the
question
in
this
sense
my
answer
to
it
may
seem
a
very
disappointing
one
if
i
am
asked
what
is
good
my
answer
is
that
good
is
good
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
or
if
i
am
asked
how
is
good
to
be
defined
my
answer
is
that
it
can
not
be
defined
and
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
about
it
but
disappointing
as
these
answers
may
appear
they
are
of
the
very
last
importance
to
readers
who
are
familiar
with
philosophic
terminology
i
can
express
their
importance
by
saying
that
they
amount
to
this
that
propositions
about
the
good
are
all
of
them
synthetic
and
never
analytic
and
that
is
plainly
no
trivial
matter
and
the
same
thing
may
be
expressed
more
popularly
by
saying
that
if
i
am
right
then
nobody
can
foist
upon
us
such
an
axiom
as
that
pleasure
is
the
only
good
or
that
the
good
is
the
desired
on
the
pretence
that
this
is
the
very
meaning
of
the
let
us
then
consider
this
position
my
point
is
that
good
is
a
simple
notion
just
as
yellow
is
a
simple
notion
that
just
as
you
can
not
by
any
manner
of
means
explain
to
any
one
who
does
not
already
know
it
what
yellow
is
so
you
can
not
explain
what
good
is
definitions
of
the
kind
that
i
was
asking
for
definitions
which
describe
the
real
nature
of
the
object
or
notion
denoted
by
a
word
and
which
do
not
merely
tell
us
what
the
word
is
used
to
mean
are
only
possible
when
the
object
or
notion
in
question
is
something
complex
you
can
give
a
definition
of
a
horse
because
a
horse
has
many
different
properties
and
qualities
all
of
which
you
can
enumerate
but
when
you
have
enumerated
them
all
when
you
have
reduced
a
horse
to
his
simplest
terms
then
you
can
no
longer
define
those
terms
they
are
simply
something
which
you
think
of
or
perceive
and
to
any
one
who
can
not
think
of
or
perceive
them
you
can
never
by
any
definition
make
their
nature
known
it
may
perhaps
be
objected
to
this
that
we
are
able
to
describe
to
others
objects
which
they
have
never
seen
or
thought
of
we
can
for
instance
make
a
man
understand
what
a
chimaera
is
although
he
has
never
heard
of
one
or
seen
one
you
can
tell
him
that
it
is
an
animal
with
a
lioness
s
head
and
body
with
a
goat
s
head
growing
from
the
middle
of
its
back
and
with
a
snake
in
place
of
a
tail
but
here
the
object
which
you
are
describing
is
a
complex
object
it
is
entirely
composed
of
parts
with
which
we
are
all
perfectly
familiar
a
snake
a
goat
a
lioness
and
we
know
too
the
manner
in
which
those
parts
are
to
be
put
together
because
we
know
what
is
meant
by
the
middle
of
a
lioness
s
back
and
where
her
tail
is
wont
to
grow
and
so
it
is
with
all
objects
not
previously
known
which
we
are
able
to
define
they
are
all
complex
all
composed
of
parts
which
may
themselves
in
the
first
instance
be
capable
of
similar
definition
but
which
must
in
the
end
be
reducible
to
simplest
parts
which
can
no
longer
be
defined
but
yellow
and
good
we
say
are
not
complex
they
are
notions
of
that
simple
kind
out
of
which
definitions
are
composed
and
with
which
the
power
of
further
defining
ceases
when
we
say
as
webster
says
the
definition
of
horse
is
a
hoofed
quadruped
of
the
genus
equus
we
may
in
fact
mean
three
different
things
we
may
mean
merely
when
i
say
horse
you
are
to
understand
that
i
am
talking
about
a
hoofed
quadruped
of
the
genus
this
might
be
called
the
arbitrary
verbal
definition
and
i
do
not
mean
that
good
is
indefinable
in
that
sense
we
may
mean
as
webster
ought
to
mean
when
most
english
people
say
horse
they
mean
a
hoofed
quadruped
of
the
genus
this
may
be
called
the
verbal
definition
proper
and
i
do
not
say
that
good
is
indefinable
in
this
sense
either
for
it
is
certainly
possible
to
discover
how
people
use
a
word
otherwise
we
could
never
have
known
that
good
may
be
translated
by
gut
in
german
and
by
bon
in
french
but
we
may
when
we
define
horse
mean
something
much
more
important
we
may
mean
that
a
certain
object
which
we
all
of
us
know
is
composed
in
a
certain
manner
that
it
has
four
legs
a
head
a
heart
a
liver
all
of
them
arranged
in
definite
relations
to
one
another
it
is
in
this
sense
that
i
deny
good
to
be
definable
i
say
that
it
is
not
composed
of
any
parts
which
we
can
substitute
for
it
in
our
minds
when
we
are
thinking
of
it
we
might
think
just
as
clearly
and
correctly
about
a
horse
if
we
thought
of
all
its
parts
and
their
arrangement
instead
of
thinking
of
the
whole
we
could
i
say
think
how
a
horse
differed
from
a
donkey
just
as
well
just
as
truly
in
this
way
as
now
we
do
only
not
so
easily
but
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
which
we
could
so
substitute
for
good
and
that
is
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
good
is
indefinable
but
i
am
afraid
i
have
still
not
removed
the
chief
difficulty
which
may
prevent
acceptance
of
the
proposition
that
good
is
indefinable
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
good
that
which
is
good
is
thus
indefinable
if
i
did
think
so
i
should
not
be
writing
on
ethics
for
my
main
object
is
to
help
towards
discovering
that
definition
it
is
just
because
i
think
there
will
be
less
risk
of
error
in
our
search
for
a
definition
of
the
good
that
i
am
now
insisting
that
is
indefinable
i
must
try
to
explain
the
difference
between
these
two
i
suppose
it
may
be
granted
that
good
is
an
adjective
well
the
good
that
which
is
good
must
therefore
be
the
substantive
to
which
the
adjective
good
will
apply
it
must
be
the
whole
of
that
to
which
the
adjective
will
apply
and
the
adjective
must
truly
apply
to
it
but
if
it
is
that
to
which
the
adjective
will
apply
it
must
be
something
different
from
that
adjective
itself
and
the
whole
of
that
something
different
whatever
it
is
will
be
our
definition
of
good
now
it
may
be
that
this
something
will
have
other
adjectives
beside
good
that
will
apply
to
it
it
may
be
full
of
pleasure
for
example
it
may
be
intelligent
and
if
these
two
adjectives
are
really
part
of
its
definition
then
it
will
certainly
be
true
that
pleasure
and
intelligence
are
good
and
many
people
appear
to
think
that
if
we
say
pleasure
and
intelligence
are
good
or
if
we
say
only
pleasure
and
intelligence
are
good
we
are
defining
well
i
can
not
deny
that
propositions
of
this
nature
may
sometimes
be
called
definitions
i
do
not
know
well
enough
how
the
word
is
generally
used
to
decide
upon
this
point
i
only
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
that
is
not
what
i
mean
when
i
say
there
is
no
possible
definition
of
good
and
that
i
shall
not
mean
this
if
i
use
the
word
again
i
do
most
fully
believe
that
some
true
proposition
of
the
form
intelligence
is
good
and
intelligence
alone
is
good
can
be
found
if
none
could
be
found
our
definition
of
good
would
be
impossible
as
it
is
i
believe
good
to
be
definable
and
yet
i
still
say
that
good
itself
is
indefinable
good
then
if
we
mean
by
it
that
quality
which
we
assert
to
belong
to
a
thing
when
we
say
that
the
thing
is
good
is
incapable
of
any
definition
in
the
most
important
sense
of
that
word
the
most
important
sense
of
definition
is
that
in
which
a
definition
states
what
are
the
parts
which
invariably
compose
a
certain
whole
and
in
this
sense
good
has
no
definition
because
it
is
simple
and
has
no
parts
it
is
one
of
those
innumerable
objects
of
thought
which
are
themselves
incapable
of
definition
because
they
are
the
ultimate
terms
by
reference
to
which
whatever
capable
of
definition
must
be
defined
that
there
must
be
an
indefinite
number
of
such
terms
is
obvious
on
reflection
since
we
can
not
define
anything
except
by
an
analysis
which
when
carried
as
far
as
it
will
go
refers
us
to
something
which
is
simply
different
from
anything
else
and
which
by
that
ultimate
difference
explains
the
peculiarity
of
the
whole
which
we
are
defining
for
every
whole
contains
some
parts
which
are
common
to
other
wholes
also
there
is
therefore
no
intrinsic
difficulty
in
the
contention
that
good
denotes
a
simple
and
indefinable
quality
there
are
many
other
instances
of
such
qualities
consider
yellow
for
example
we
may
try
to
define
it
by
describing
its
physical
equivalent
we
may
state
what
kind
of
must
stimulate
the
normal
eye
in
order
that
we
may
perceive
it
but
a
moment
s
reflection
is
sufficient
to
shew
that
those
are
not
themselves
what
we
mean
by
yellow
are
not
what
we
perceive
indeed
we
should
never
have
been
able
to
discover
their
existence
unless
we
had
first
been
struck
by
the
patent
difference
of
quality
between
the
different
colours
the
most
we
can
be
entitled
to
say
of
those
vibrations
is
that
they
are
what
corresponds
in
space
to
the
yellow
which
we
actually
perceive
yet
a
mistake
of
this
simple
kind
has
commonly
been
made
about
it
may
be
true
that
all
things
which
are
good
are
something
else
just
as
it
is
true
that
all
things
which
are
yellow
produce
a
certain
kind
of
vibration
in
the
light
and
it
is
a
fact
that
ethics
aims
at
discovering
what
are
those
other
properties
belonging
to
all
things
which
are
good
but
far
too
many
philosophers
have
thought
that
when
they
named
those
other
properties
they
were
actually
defining
good
that
these
properties
in
fact
were
simply
not
other
but
absolutely
and
entirely
the
same
with
goodness
this
view
i
propose
to
call
the
naturalistic
fallacy
and
of
it
i
shall
now
endeavour
to
dispose
let
us
consider
what
it
is
such
philosophers
say
and
first
it
is
to
be
noticed
that
they
do
not
agree
among
themselves
they
not
only
say
that
they
are
right
as
to
what
good
is
but
they
endeavour
to
prove
that
other
people
who
say
that
it
is
something
else
are
wrong
one
for
instance
will
affirm
that
good
is
pleasure
another
perhaps
that
good
is
that
which
is
desired
and
each
of
these
will
argue
eagerly
to
prove
that
the
other
is
wrong
but
how
is
that
possible
one
of
them
says
that
good
is
nothing
but
the
object
of
desire
and
at
the
same
time
tries
to
prove
that
it
is
not
pleasure
but
from
his
first
assertion
that
good
just
means
the
object
of
desire
one
of
two
things
must
follow
as
regards
his
proof
he
may
be
trying
to
prove
that
the
object
of
desire
is
not
pleasure
but
if
this
be
all
where
is
his
ethics
the
position
he
is
maintaining
is
merely
a
psychological
one
desire
is
something
which
occurs
in
our
minds
and
pleasure
is
something
else
which
so
occurs
and
our
ethical
philosopher
is
merely
holding
that
the
latter
is
not
the
object
of
the
former
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
question
in
dispute
his
opponent
held
the
ethical
proposition
that
pleasure
was
the
good
and
although
he
should
prove
a
million
times
over
the
psychological
proposition
that
pleasure
is
not
the
object
of
desire
he
is
no
nearer
proving
his
opponent
to
be
wrong
the
position
is
like
this
one
man
says
a
triangle
is
a
circle
another
replies
a
triangle
is
a
straight
line
and
i
will
prove
to
you
that
i
am
right
this
is
the
only
argument
a
straight
line
is
not
a
that
is
quite
true
the
other
may
reply
but
nevertheless
a
triangle
is
a
circle
and
you
have
said
nothing
whatever
to
prove
the
contrary
what
is
proved
is
that
one
of
us
is
wrong
for
we
agree
that
a
triangle
can
not
be
both
a
straight
line
and
a
circle
but
which
is
wrong
there
can
be
no
earthly
means
of
proving
since
you
define
triangle
as
straight
line
and
i
define
it
as
well
that
is
one
alternative
which
any
naturalistic
ethics
has
to
face
if
good
is
as
something
else
it
is
then
impossible
either
to
prove
that
any
other
definition
is
wrong
or
even
to
deny
such
definition
the
other
alternative
will
scarcely
be
more
welcome
it
is
that
the
discussion
is
after
all
a
verbal
one
when
a
says
good
means
pleasant
and
b
says
good
means
desired
they
may
merely
wish
to
assert
that
most
people
have
used
the
word
for
what
is
pleasant
and
for
what
is
desired
respectively
and
this
is
quite
an
interesting
subject
for
discussion
only
it
is
not
a
whit
more
an
ethical
discussion
than
the
last
was
nor
do
i
think
that
any
exponent
of
naturalistic
ethics
would
be
willing
to
allow
that
this
was
all
he
meant
they
are
all
so
anxious
to
persuade
us
that
what
they
call
the
good
is
what
we
really
ought
to
do
do
pray
act
so
because
the
word
good
is
generally
used
to
denote
actions
of
this
nature
such
on
this
view
would
be
the
substance
of
their
teaching
and
in
so
far
as
they
tell
us
how
we
ought
to
act
their
teaching
is
truly
ethical
as
they
mean
it
to
be
but
how
perfectly
absurd
is
the
reason
they
would
give
for
it
you
are
to
do
this
because
most
people
use
a
certain
word
to
denote
conduct
such
as
you
are
to
say
the
thing
which
is
not
because
most
people
call
it
that
is
an
argument
just
as
good
my
dear
sirs
what
we
want
to
know
from
you
as
ethical
teachers
is
not
how
people
use
a
word
it
is
not
even
what
kind
of
actions
they
approve
which
the
use
of
this
word
good
may
certainly
imply
what
we
want
to
know
is
simply
what
good
we
may
indeed
agree
that
what
most
people
do
think
good
is
actually
so
we
shall
at
all
events
be
glad
to
know
their
opinions
but
when
we
say
their
opinions
about
what
good
we
do
mean
what
we
say
we
do
not
care
whether
they
call
that
thing
which
they
mean
horse
or
table
or
chair
gut
or
bon
or
ἀγαθός
we
want
to
know
what
it
is
that
they
so
call
when
they
say
pleasure
is
good
we
can
not
believe
that
they
merely
mean
pleasure
is
pleasure
and
nothing
more
than
that
suppose
a
man
says
i
am
pleased
and
suppose
that
is
not
a
lie
or
a
mistake
but
the
truth
well
if
it
is
true
what
does
that
mean
it
means
that
his
mind
a
certain
definite
mind
distinguished
by
certain
definite
marks
from
all
others
has
at
this
moment
a
certain
definite
feeling
called
pleasure
pleased
nothing
but
having
pleasure
and
though
we
may
be
more
pleased
or
less
pleased
and
even
we
may
admit
for
the
present
have
one
or
another
kind
of
pleasure
yet
in
so
far
as
it
is
pleasure
we
have
whether
there
be
more
or
less
of
it
and
whether
it
be
of
one
kind
or
another
what
we
have
is
one
definite
thing
absolutely
indefinable
some
one
thing
that
is
the
same
in
all
the
various
degrees
and
in
all
the
various
kinds
of
it
that
there
may
be
we
may
be
able
to
say
how
it
is
related
to
other
things
that
for
example
it
is
in
the
mind
that
it
causes
desire
that
we
are
conscious
of
it
etc
we
can
i
say
describe
its
relations
to
other
things
but
define
it
we
can
and
if
anybody
tried
to
define
pleasure
for
us
as
being
any
other
natural
object
if
anybody
were
to
say
for
instance
that
pleasure
the
sensation
of
red
and
were
to
proceed
to
deduce
from
that
that
pleasure
is
a
colour
we
should
be
entitled
to
laugh
at
him
and
to
distrust
his
future
statements
about
pleasure
well
that
would
be
the
same
fallacy
which
i
have
called
the
naturalistic
fallacy
that
pleased
does
not
mean
having
the
sensation
of
red
or
anything
else
whatever
does
not
prevent
us
from
understanding
what
it
does
mean
it
is
enough
for
us
to
know
that
pleased
does
mean
having
the
sensation
of
pleasure
and
though
pleasure
is
absolutely
indefinable
though
pleasure
is
pleasure
and
nothing
else
whatever
yet
we
feel
no
difficulty
in
saying
that
we
are
pleased
the
reason
is
of
course
that
when
i
say
i
am
pleased
i
do
mean
that
i
am
the
same
thing
as
having
and
similarly
no
difficulty
need
be
found
in
my
saying
that
pleasure
is
good
and
yet
not
meaning
that
pleasure
is
the
same
thing
as
good
that
pleasure
good
and
that
good
pleasure
if
i
were
to
imagine
that
when
i
said
i
am
pleased
i
meant
that
i
was
exactly
the
same
thing
as
pleased
i
should
not
indeed
call
that
a
naturalistic
fallacy
although
it
would
be
the
same
fallacy
as
i
have
called
naturalistic
with
reference
to
ethics
the
reason
of
this
is
obvious
enough
when
a
man
confuses
two
natural
objects
with
one
another
defining
the
one
by
the
other
if
for
instance
he
confuses
himself
who
is
one
natural
object
with
pleased
or
with
pleasure
which
are
others
then
there
is
no
reason
to
call
the
fallacy
naturalistic
but
if
he
confuses
good
which
is
not
in
the
same
sense
a
natural
object
with
any
natural
object
whatever
then
there
is
a
reason
for
calling
that
a
naturalistic
fallacy
its
being
made
with
regard
to
good
marks
it
as
something
quite
specific
and
this
specific
mistake
deserves
a
name
because
it
is
so
common
as
for
the
reasons
why
good
is
not
to
be
considered
a
natural
object
they
may
be
reserved
for
discussion
in
another
place
but
for
the
present
it
is
sufficient
to
notice
this
even
if
it
were
a
natural
object
that
would
not
alter
the
nature
of
the
fallacy
nor
diminish
its
importance
one
whit
all
that
i
have
said
about
it
would
remain
quite
equally
true
only
the
name
which
i
have
called
it
would
not
be
so
appropriate
as
i
think
it
is
and
i
do
not
care
about
the
name
what
i
do
care
about
is
the
fallacy
it
does
not
matter
what
we
call
it
provided
we
recognise
it
when
we
meet
with
it
it
is
to
be
met
with
in
almost
every
book
on
ethics
and
yet
it
is
not
recognised
and
that
is
why
it
is
necessary
to
multiply
illustrations
of
it
and
convenient
to
give
it
a
name
it
is
a
very
simple
fallacy
indeed
when
we
say
that
an
orange
is
yellow
we
do
not
think
our
statement
binds
us
to
hold
that
orange
means
nothing
else
than
yellow
or
that
nothing
can
be
yellow
but
an
orange
supposing
the
orange
is
also
sweet
does
that
bind
us
to
say
that
sweet
is
exactly
the
same
thing
as
yellow
that
sweet
must
be
defined
as
yellow
and
supposing
it
be
recognised
that
yellow
just
means
yellow
and
nothing
else
whatever
does
that
make
it
any
more
difficult
to
hold
that
oranges
are
yellow
most
certainly
it
does
not
on
the
contrary
it
would
be
absolutely
meaningless
to
say
that
oranges
were
yellow
unless
yellow
did
in
the
end
mean
just
yellow
and
nothing
else
whatever
unless
it
was
absolutely
indefinable
we
should
not
get
any
very
clear
notion
about
things
which
are
yellow
we
should
not
get
very
far
with
our
science
if
we
were
bound
to
hold
that
everything
which
was
yellow
exactly
the
same
thing
as
yellow
we
should
find
we
had
to
hold
that
an
orange
was
exactly
the
same
thing
as
a
stool
a
piece
of
paper
a
lemon
anything
you
like
we
could
prove
any
number
of
absurdities
but
should
we
be
the
nearer
to
the
truth
why
then
should
it
be
different
with
good
why
if
good
is
good
and
indefinable
should
i
be
held
to
deny
that
pleasure
is
good
is
there
any
difficulty
in
holding
both
to
be
true
at
once
on
the
contrary
there
is
no
meaning
in
saying
that
pleasure
is
good
unless
good
is
something
different
from
pleasure
it
is
absolutely
useless
so
far
as
ethics
is
concerned
to
prove
as
mr
spencer
tries
to
do
that
increase
of
pleasure
coincides
with
increase
of
life
unless
good
something
different
from
either
life
or
pleasure
he
might
just
as
well
try
to
prove
that
an
orange
is
yellow
by
shewing
that
it
always
is
wrapped
up
in
paper
in
fact
if
it
is
not
the
case
that
good
denotes
something
simple
and
indefinable
only
two
alternatives
are
possible
either
it
is
a
complex
a
given
whole
about
the
correct
analysis
of
which
there
may
be
disagreement
or
else
it
means
nothing
at
all
and
there
is
no
such
subject
as
ethics
in
general
however
ethical
philosophers
have
attempted
to
define
good
without
recognising
what
such
an
attempt
must
mean
they
actually
use
arguments
which
involve
one
or
both
of
the
absurdities
considered
in
we
are
therefore
justified
in
concluding
that
the
attempt
to
define
good
is
chiefly
due
to
want
of
clearness
as
to
the
possible
nature
of
definition
there
are
in
fact
only
two
serious
alternatives
to
be
considered
in
order
to
establish
the
conclusion
that
good
does
denote
a
simple
and
indefinable
notion
it
might
possibly
denote
a
complex
as
horse
does
or
it
might
have
no
meaning
at
all
neither
of
these
possibilities
has
however
been
clearly
conceived
and
seriously
maintained
as
such
by
those
who
presume
to
define
good
and
both
may
be
dismissed
by
a
simple
appeal
to
facts
the
hypothesis
that
disagreement
about
the
meaning
of
good
is
disagreement
with
regard
to
the
correct
analysis
of
a
given
whole
may
be
most
plainly
seen
to
be
incorrect
by
consideration
of
the
fact
that
whatever
definition
be
offered
it
may
be
always
asked
with
significance
of
the
complex
so
defined
whether
it
is
itself
good
to
take
for
instance
one
of
the
more
plausible
because
one
of
the
more
complicated
of
such
proposed
definitions
it
may
easily
be
thought
at
first
sight
that
to
be
good
may
mean
to
be
that
which
we
desire
to
desire
thus
if
we
apply
this
definition
to
a
particular
instance
and
say
when
we
think
that
a
is
good
we
are
thinking
that
a
is
one
of
the
things
which
we
desire
to
desire
our
proposition
may
seem
quite
plausible
but
if
we
carry
the
investigation
further
and
ask
ourselves
is
it
good
to
desire
to
desire
a
it
is
apparent
on
a
little
reflection
that
this
question
is
itself
as
intelligible
as
the
original
question
is
a
good
that
we
are
in
fact
now
asking
for
exactly
the
same
information
about
the
desire
to
desire
a
for
which
we
formerly
asked
with
regard
to
a
itself
but
it
is
also
apparent
that
the
meaning
of
this
second
question
can
not
be
correctly
analysed
into
is
the
desire
to
desire
a
one
of
the
things
which
we
desire
to
desire
we
have
not
before
our
minds
anything
so
complicated
as
the
question
do
we
desire
to
desire
to
desire
to
desire
a
moreover
any
one
can
easily
convince
himself
by
inspection
that
the
predicate
of
this
proposition
good
is
positively
different
from
the
notion
of
desiring
to
desire
which
enters
into
its
subject
that
we
should
desire
to
desire
a
is
good
is
merely
equivalent
to
that
a
should
be
good
is
it
may
indeed
be
true
that
what
we
desire
to
desire
is
always
also
good
perhaps
even
the
converse
may
be
true
but
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
this
is
the
case
and
the
mere
fact
that
we
understand
very
well
what
is
meant
by
doubting
it
shews
clearly
that
we
have
two
different
notions
before
our
minds
and
the
same
consideration
is
sufficient
to
dismiss
the
hypothesis
that
good
has
no
meaning
whatsoever
it
is
very
natural
to
make
the
mistake
of
supposing
that
what
is
universally
true
is
of
such
a
nature
that
its
negation
would
be
the
importance
which
has
been
assigned
to
analytic
propositions
in
the
history
of
philosophy
shews
how
easy
such
a
mistake
is
and
thus
it
is
very
easy
to
conclude
that
what
seems
to
be
a
universal
ethical
principle
is
in
fact
an
identical
proposition
that
if
for
example
whatever
is
called
good
seems
to
be
pleasant
the
proposition
pleasure
is
the
good
does
not
assert
a
connection
between
two
different
notions
but
involves
only
one
that
of
pleasure
which
is
easily
recognised
as
a
distinct
entity
but
whoever
will
attentively
consider
with
himself
what
is
actually
before
his
mind
when
he
asks
the
question
is
pleasure
or
whatever
it
may
be
after
all
good
can
easily
satisfy
himself
that
he
is
not
merely
wondering
whether
pleasure
is
pleasant
and
if
he
will
try
this
experiment
with
each
suggested
definition
in
succession
he
may
become
expert
enough
to
recognise
that
in
every
case
he
has
before
his
mind
a
unique
object
with
regard
to
the
connection
of
which
with
any
other
object
a
distinct
question
may
be
asked
every
one
does
in
fact
understand
the
question
is
this
good
when
he
thinks
of
it
his
state
of
mind
is
different
from
what
it
would
be
were
he
asked
is
this
pleasant
or
desired
or
approved
it
has
a
distinct
meaning
for
him
even
though
he
may
not
recognise
in
what
respect
it
is
distinct
whenever
he
thinks
of
intrinsic
value
or
intrinsic
worth
or
says
that
a
thing
ought
to
exist
he
has
before
his
mind
the
unique
object
the
unique
property
of
things
which
i
mean
by
everybody
is
constantly
aware
of
this
notion
although
he
may
never
become
aware
at
all
that
it
is
different
from
other
notions
of
which
he
is
also
aware
but
for
correct
ethical
reasoning
it
is
extremely
important
that
he
should
become
aware
of
this
fact
and
as
soon
as
the
nature
of
the
problem
is
clearly
understood
there
should
be
little
difficulty
in
advancing
so
far
in
analysis
good
then
is
indefinable
and
yet
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
only
one
ethical
writer
henry
sidgwick
who
has
clearly
recognised
and
stated
this
fact
we
shall
see
indeed
how
far
many
of
the
most
reputed
ethical
systems
fall
short
of
drawing
the
conclusions
which
follow
from
such
a
recognition
at
present
i
will
only
quote
one
instance
which
will
serve
to
illustrate
the
meaning
and
importance
of
this
principle
that
good
is
indefinable
or
as
sidgwick
says
an
unanalysable
it
is
an
instance
to
which
sidgwick
himself
refers
in
a
note
on
the
passage
in
which
he
argues
that
ought
is
unanalysable
of
bk
i
chap
iii
edition
bentham
says
sidgwick
explains
that
his
fundamental
principle
states
the
greatest
happiness
of
all
those
whose
interest
is
in
question
as
being
the
right
and
proper
end
of
human
action
and
yet
his
language
in
other
passages
of
the
same
chapter
would
seem
to
imply
that
he
by
the
word
right
conducive
to
the
general
sidgwick
sees
that
if
you
take
these
two
statements
together
you
get
the
absurd
result
that
greatest
happiness
is
the
end
of
human
action
which
is
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
and
so
absurd
does
it
seem
to
him
to
call
this
result
as
bentham
calls
it
the
fundamental
principle
of
a
moral
system
that
he
suggests
that
bentham
can
not
have
meant
it
yet
sidgwick
himself
states
elsewhere
that
psychological
hedonism
is
not
seldom
confounded
with
egoistic
hedonism
and
that
confusion
as
we
shall
see
rests
chiefly
on
that
same
fallacy
the
naturalistic
fallacy
which
is
implied
in
bentham
s
statements
sidgwick
admits
therefore
that
this
fallacy
is
sometimes
committed
absurd
as
it
is
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
bentham
may
really
have
been
one
of
those
who
committed
it
mill
as
we
shall
see
certainly
did
commit
it
in
any
case
whether
bentham
committed
it
or
not
his
doctrine
as
above
quoted
will
serve
as
a
very
good
illustration
of
this
fallacy
and
of
the
importance
of
the
contrary
proposition
that
good
is
indefinable
of
bk
i
chap
iv
let
us
consider
this
doctrine
bentham
seems
to
imply
so
sidgwick
says
that
the
word
right
conducive
to
general
now
this
by
itself
need
not
necessarily
involve
the
naturalistic
fallacy
for
the
word
right
is
very
commonly
appropriated
to
actions
which
lead
to
the
attainment
of
what
is
good
which
are
regarded
as
to
the
ideal
and
not
as
this
use
of
right
as
denoting
what
is
good
as
a
means
whether
or
not
it
be
also
good
as
an
end
is
indeed
the
use
to
which
i
shall
confine
the
word
had
bentham
been
using
right
in
this
sense
it
might
be
perfectly
consistent
for
him
to
right
as
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
and
notice
this
proviso
he
had
already
proved
or
laid
down
as
an
axiom
that
general
happiness
was
good
or
what
is
equivalent
to
this
that
general
happiness
alone
was
good
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
already
defined
good
as
general
happiness
a
position
perfectly
consistent
as
we
have
seen
with
the
contention
that
good
is
indefinable
and
since
right
was
to
be
defined
as
conducive
to
good
it
would
actually
conducive
to
general
but
this
method
of
escape
from
the
charge
of
having
committed
the
naturalistic
fallacy
has
been
closed
by
bentham
himself
for
his
fundamental
principle
is
we
see
that
the
greatest
happiness
of
all
concerned
is
the
and
proper
of
human
action
he
applies
the
word
right
therefore
to
the
end
as
such
not
only
to
the
means
which
are
conducive
to
it
and
that
being
so
right
can
no
longer
be
defined
as
conducive
to
the
general
happiness
without
involving
the
fallacy
in
question
for
now
it
is
obvious
that
the
definition
of
right
as
conducive
to
general
happiness
can
be
used
by
him
in
support
of
the
fundamental
principle
that
general
happiness
is
the
right
end
instead
of
being
itself
derived
from
that
principle
if
right
by
definition
means
conducive
to
general
happiness
then
it
is
obvious
that
general
happiness
is
the
right
end
it
is
not
necessary
now
first
to
prove
or
assert
that
general
happiness
is
the
right
end
before
right
is
defined
as
conducive
to
general
happiness
a
perfectly
valid
procedure
but
on
the
contrary
the
definition
of
right
as
conducive
to
general
happiness
proves
general
happiness
to
be
the
right
end
a
perfectly
invalid
procedure
since
in
this
case
the
statement
that
general
happiness
is
the
right
end
of
human
action
is
not
an
ethical
principle
at
all
but
either
as
we
have
seen
a
proposition
about
the
meaning
of
words
or
else
a
proposition
about
the
of
general
happiness
not
about
its
rightness
or
goodness
now
i
do
not
wish
the
importance
i
assign
to
this
fallacy
to
be
misunderstood
the
discovery
of
it
does
not
at
all
refute
bentham
s
contention
that
greatest
happiness
is
the
proper
end
of
human
action
if
that
be
understood
as
an
ethical
proposition
as
he
undoubtedly
intended
it
that
principle
may
be
true
all
the
same
we
shall
consider
whether
it
is
so
in
succeeding
chapters
bentham
might
have
maintained
it
as
professor
sidgwick
does
even
if
the
fallacy
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
what
i
am
maintaining
is
that
the
which
he
actually
gives
for
his
ethical
proposition
are
fallacious
ones
so
far
as
they
consist
in
a
definition
of
right
what
i
suggest
is
that
he
did
not
perceive
them
to
be
fallacious
that
if
he
had
done
so
he
would
have
been
led
to
seek
for
other
reasons
in
support
of
his
utilitarianism
and
that
had
he
sought
for
other
reasons
he
have
found
none
which
he
thought
to
be
sufficient
in
that
case
he
would
have
changed
his
whole
system
a
most
important
consequence
it
is
undoubtedly
also
possible
that
he
would
have
thought
other
reasons
to
be
sufficient
and
in
that
case
his
ethical
system
in
its
main
results
would
still
have
stood
but
even
in
this
latter
case
his
use
of
the
fallacy
would
be
a
serious
objection
to
him
as
an
ethical
philosopher
for
it
is
the
business
of
ethics
i
must
insist
not
only
to
obtain
true
results
but
also
to
find
valid
reasons
for
them
the
direct
object
of
ethics
is
knowledge
and
not
practice
and
any
one
who
uses
the
naturalistic
fallacy
has
certainly
not
fulfilled
this
first
object
however
correct
his
practical
principles
may
be
my
objections
to
naturalism
are
then
in
the
first
place
that
it
offers
no
reason
at
all
far
less
any
valid
reason
for
any
ethical
principle
whatever
and
in
this
it
already
fails
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
ethics
as
a
scientific
study
but
in
the
second
place
i
contend
that
though
it
gives
a
reason
for
no
ethical
principle
it
is
a
of
the
acceptance
of
false
principles
it
deludes
the
mind
into
accepting
ethical
principles
which
are
false
and
in
this
it
is
contrary
to
every
aim
of
ethics
it
is
easy
to
see
that
if
we
start
with
a
definition
of
right
conduct
as
conduct
conducive
to
general
happiness
then
knowing
that
right
conduct
is
universally
conduct
conducive
to
the
good
we
very
easily
arrive
at
the
result
that
the
good
is
general
happiness
if
on
the
other
hand
we
once
recognise
that
we
must
start
our
ethics
without
a
definition
we
shall
be
much
more
apt
to
look
about
us
before
we
adopt
any
ethical
principle
whatever
and
the
more
we
look
about
us
the
less
likely
are
we
to
adopt
a
false
one
it
may
be
replied
to
this
yes
but
we
shall
look
about
us
just
as
much
before
we
settle
on
our
definition
and
are
therefore
just
as
likely
to
be
right
but
i
will
try
to
shew
that
this
is
not
the
case
if
we
start
with
the
conviction
that
a
definition
of
good
can
be
found
we
start
with
the
conviction
that
good
nothing
else
than
some
one
property
of
things
and
our
only
business
will
then
be
to
discover
what
that
property
is
but
if
we
recognise
that
so
far
as
the
meaning
of
good
goes
anything
whatever
may
be
good
we
start
with
a
much
more
open
mind
moreover
apart
from
the
fact
that
when
we
think
we
have
a
definition
we
can
not
logically
defend
our
ethical
principles
in
any
way
whatever
we
shall
also
be
much
less
apt
to
defend
them
well
even
if
illogically
for
we
shall
start
with
the
conviction
that
good
must
mean
so
and
so
and
shall
therefore
be
inclined
either
to
misunderstand
our
opponent
s
arguments
or
to
cut
them
short
with
the
reply
this
is
not
an
open
question
the
very
meaning
of
the
word
decides
it
no
one
can
think
otherwise
except
through
our
first
conclusion
as
to
the
of
ethics
is
then
that
there
is
a
simple
indefinable
unanalysable
object
of
thought
by
reference
to
which
it
must
be
defined
by
what
name
we
call
this
unique
object
is
a
matter
of
indifference
so
long
as
we
clearly
recognise
what
it
is
and
that
it
does
differ
from
other
objects
the
words
which
are
commonly
taken
as
the
signs
of
ethical
judgments
all
do
refer
to
it
and
they
are
expressions
of
ethical
judgments
solely
because
they
do
so
refer
but
they
may
refer
to
it
in
two
different
ways
which
it
is
very
important
to
distinguish
if
we
are
to
have
a
complete
definition
of
the
range
of
ethical
judgments
before
i
proceeded
to
argue
that
there
was
such
an
indefinable
notion
involved
in
ethical
notions
i
stated
that
it
was
necessary
for
ethics
to
enumerate
all
true
universal
judgments
asserting
that
such
and
such
a
thing
was
good
whenever
it
occurred
but
although
all
such
judgments
do
refer
to
that
unique
notion
which
i
have
called
good
they
do
not
all
refer
to
it
in
the
same
way
they
may
either
assert
that
this
unique
property
does
always
attach
to
the
thing
in
question
or
else
they
may
assert
only
that
the
thing
in
question
is
cause
or
necessary
for
the
existence
of
other
things
to
which
this
unique
property
does
attach
the
nature
of
these
two
species
of
universal
ethical
judgments
is
extremely
different
and
a
great
part
of
the
difficulties
which
are
met
with
in
ordinary
ethical
speculation
are
due
to
the
failure
to
distinguish
them
clearly
their
difference
has
indeed
received
expression
in
ordinary
language
by
the
contrast
between
the
terms
good
as
means
and
good
in
itself
value
as
a
means
and
intrinsic
but
these
terms
are
apt
to
be
applied
correctly
only
in
the
more
obvious
instances
and
this
seems
to
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
distinction
between
the
conceptions
which
they
denote
has
not
been
made
a
separate
object
of
investigation
this
distinction
may
be
briefly
pointed
out
as
follows
whenever
we
judge
that
a
thing
is
good
as
a
means
we
are
making
a
judgment
with
regard
to
its
causal
relations
we
judge
that
it
will
have
a
particular
kind
of
effect
that
that
effect
will
be
good
in
itself
but
to
find
causal
judgments
that
are
universally
true
is
notoriously
a
matter
of
extreme
difficulty
the
late
date
at
which
most
of
the
physical
sciences
became
exact
and
the
comparative
fewness
of
the
laws
which
they
have
succeeded
in
establishing
even
now
are
sufficient
proofs
of
this
difficulty
with
regard
then
to
what
are
the
most
frequent
objects
of
ethical
judgments
namely
actions
it
is
obvious
that
we
can
not
be
satisfied
that
any
of
our
universal
causal
judgments
are
true
even
in
the
sense
in
which
scientific
laws
are
so
we
can
not
even
discover
hypothetical
laws
of
the
form
exactly
this
action
will
always
under
these
conditions
produce
exactly
that
but
for
a
correct
ethical
judgment
with
regard
to
the
effects
of
certain
actions
we
require
more
than
this
in
two
respects
we
require
to
know
that
a
given
action
will
produce
a
certain
effect
whatever
circumstances
it
but
this
is
certainly
impossible
it
is
certain
that
in
different
circumstances
the
same
action
may
produce
effects
which
are
utterly
different
in
all
respects
upon
which
the
value
of
the
effects
depends
hence
we
can
never
be
entitled
to
more
than
a
to
a
proposition
of
the
form
this
result
follows
this
kind
of
action
and
even
this
generalisation
will
only
be
true
if
the
circumstances
under
which
the
action
occurs
are
generally
the
same
this
is
in
fact
the
case
to
a
great
extent
within
any
one
particular
age
and
state
of
society
but
when
we
take
other
ages
into
account
in
many
most
important
cases
the
normal
circumstances
of
a
given
kind
of
action
will
be
so
different
that
the
generalisation
which
is
true
for
one
will
not
be
true
for
another
with
regard
then
to
ethical
judgments
which
assert
that
a
certain
kind
of
action
is
good
as
a
means
to
a
certain
kind
of
effect
none
will
be
true
and
many
though
true
at
one
period
will
be
generally
false
at
others
but
we
require
to
know
not
only
that
good
effect
will
be
produced
but
that
among
all
subsequent
events
affected
by
the
action
in
question
the
balance
of
good
will
be
greater
than
if
any
other
possible
action
had
been
performed
in
other
words
to
judge
that
an
action
is
generally
a
means
to
good
is
to
judge
not
only
that
it
generally
does
good
but
that
it
generally
does
the
greatest
good
of
which
the
circumstances
admit
in
this
respect
ethical
judgments
about
the
effects
of
action
involve
a
difficulty
and
a
complication
far
greater
than
that
involved
in
the
establishment
of
scientific
laws
for
the
latter
we
need
only
consider
a
single
effect
for
the
former
it
is
essential
to
consider
not
only
this
but
the
effects
of
that
effect
and
so
on
as
far
as
our
view
into
the
future
can
reach
it
is
indeed
obvious
that
our
view
can
never
reach
far
enough
for
us
to
be
certain
that
any
action
will
produce
the
best
possible
effects
we
must
be
content
if
the
greatest
possible
balance
of
good
seems
to
be
produced
within
a
limited
period
but
it
is
important
to
notice
that
the
whole
series
of
effects
within
a
period
of
considerable
length
is
actually
taken
account
of
in
our
common
judgments
that
an
action
is
good
as
a
means
and
that
hence
this
additional
complication
which
makes
ethical
generalisations
so
far
more
difficult
to
establish
than
scientific
laws
is
one
which
is
involved
in
actual
ethical
discussions
and
is
of
practical
importance
the
commonest
rules
of
conduct
involve
such
considerations
as
the
balancing
of
future
bad
health
against
immediate
gains
and
even
if
we
can
never
settle
with
any
certainty
how
we
shall
secure
the
greatest
possible
total
of
good
we
try
at
least
to
assure
ourselves
that
probable
future
evils
will
not
be
greater
than
the
immediate
good
there
are
then
judgments
which
state
that
certain
kinds
of
things
have
good
effects
and
such
judgments
for
the
reasons
just
given
have
the
important
characteristics
that
they
are
unlikely
to
be
true
if
they
state
that
the
kind
of
thing
in
question
has
good
effects
and
that
even
if
they
only
state
that
it
has
good
effects
many
of
them
will
only
be
true
of
certain
periods
in
the
world
s
history
on
the
other
hand
there
are
judgments
which
state
that
certain
kinds
of
things
are
themselves
good
and
these
differ
from
the
last
in
that
if
true
at
all
they
are
all
of
them
universally
true
it
is
therefore
extremely
important
to
distinguish
these
two
kinds
of
possible
judgments
both
may
be
expressed
in
the
same
language
in
both
cases
we
commonly
say
such
and
such
a
thing
is
but
in
the
one
case
good
will
mean
good
as
means
merely
that
the
thing
is
a
means
to
good
will
have
good
effects
in
the
other
case
it
will
mean
good
as
end
we
shall
be
judging
that
the
thing
itself
has
the
property
which
in
the
first
case
we
asserted
only
to
belong
to
its
effects
it
is
plain
that
these
are
very
different
assertions
to
make
about
a
thing
it
is
plain
that
either
or
both
of
them
may
be
made
both
truly
and
falsely
about
all
manner
of
things
and
it
is
certain
that
unless
we
are
clear
as
to
which
of
the
two
we
mean
to
assert
we
shall
have
a
very
poor
chance
of
deciding
rightly
whether
our
assertion
is
true
or
false
it
is
precisely
this
clearness
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
question
asked
which
has
hitherto
been
almost
entirely
lacking
in
ethical
speculation
ethics
has
always
been
predominantly
concerned
with
the
investigation
of
a
limited
class
of
actions
with
regard
to
these
we
may
ask
how
far
they
are
good
in
themselves
how
far
they
have
a
general
tendency
to
produce
good
results
and
the
arguments
brought
forward
in
ethical
discussion
have
always
been
of
both
classes
both
such
as
would
prove
the
conduct
in
question
to
be
good
in
itself
and
such
as
would
prove
it
to
be
good
as
a
means
but
that
these
are
the
only
questions
which
any
ethical
discussion
can
have
to
settle
and
that
to
settle
the
one
is
the
same
thing
as
to
settle
the
other
these
two
fundamental
facts
have
in
general
escaped
the
notice
of
ethical
philosophers
ethical
questions
are
commonly
asked
in
an
ambiguous
form
it
is
asked
what
is
a
man
s
duty
under
these
circumstances
or
is
it
right
to
act
in
this
way
or
what
ought
we
to
aim
at
securing
but
all
these
questions
are
capable
of
further
analysis
a
correct
answer
to
any
of
them
involves
both
judgments
of
what
is
good
in
itself
and
causal
judgments
this
is
implied
even
by
those
who
maintain
that
we
have
a
direct
and
immediate
judgment
of
absolute
rights
and
duties
such
a
judgment
can
only
mean
that
the
course
of
action
in
question
is
best
thing
to
do
that
by
acting
so
every
good
that
be
secured
will
have
been
secured
now
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
question
whether
such
a
judgment
will
ever
be
true
the
question
is
what
does
it
imply
if
it
is
true
and
the
only
possible
answer
is
that
whether
true
or
false
it
implies
both
a
proposition
as
to
the
degree
of
goodness
of
the
action
in
question
as
compared
with
other
things
and
a
number
of
causal
propositions
for
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
action
will
have
consequences
and
to
deny
that
the
consequences
matter
is
to
make
a
judgment
of
their
intrinsic
value
as
compared
with
the
action
itself
in
asserting
that
the
action
is
best
thing
to
do
we
assert
that
it
together
with
its
consequences
presents
a
greater
sum
of
intrinsic
value
than
any
possible
alternative
and
this
condition
may
be
realised
by
any
of
the
three
cases
if
the
action
itself
has
greater
intrinsic
value
than
any
alternative
whereas
both
its
consequences
and
those
of
the
alternatives
are
absolutely
devoid
either
of
intrinsic
merit
or
intrinsic
demerit
or
if
though
its
consequences
are
intrinsically
bad
the
balance
of
intrinsic
value
is
greater
than
would
be
produced
by
any
alternative
or
if
its
consequences
being
intrinsically
good
the
degree
of
value
belonging
to
them
and
it
conjointly
is
greater
than
that
of
any
alternative
series
in
short
to
assert
that
a
certain
line
of
conduct
is
at
a
given
time
absolutely
right
or
obligatory
is
obviously
to
assert
that
more
good
or
less
evil
will
exist
in
the
world
if
it
be
adopted
than
if
anything
else
be
done
instead
but
this
implies
a
judgment
as
to
the
value
both
of
its
own
consequences
and
of
those
of
any
possible
alternative
and
that
an
action
will
have
such
and
such
consequences
involves
a
number
of
causal
judgments
similarly
in
answering
the
question
what
ought
we
to
aim
at
securing
causal
judgments
are
again
involved
but
in
a
somewhat
different
way
we
are
liable
to
forget
because
it
is
so
obvious
that
this
question
can
never
be
answered
correctly
except
by
naming
something
which
be
secured
not
everything
can
be
secured
and
even
if
we
judge
that
nothing
which
can
not
be
obtained
would
be
of
equal
value
with
that
which
can
the
possibility
of
the
latter
as
well
as
its
value
is
essential
to
its
being
a
proper
end
of
action
accordingly
neither
our
judgments
as
to
what
actions
we
ought
to
perform
nor
even
our
judgments
as
to
the
ends
which
they
ought
to
produce
are
pure
judgments
of
intrinsic
value
with
regard
to
the
former
an
action
which
is
absolutely
obligatory
have
no
intrinsic
value
whatsoever
that
it
is
perfectly
virtuous
may
mean
merely
that
it
causes
the
best
possible
effects
and
with
regard
to
the
latter
these
best
possible
results
which
justify
our
action
can
in
any
case
have
only
so
much
of
intrinsic
value
as
the
laws
of
nature
allow
us
to
secure
and
they
in
their
turn
have
no
intrinsic
value
whatsoever
but
may
merely
be
a
means
to
the
attainment
in
a
still
further
future
of
something
that
has
such
value
whenever
therefore
we
ask
what
ought
we
to
do
or
what
ought
we
to
try
to
get
we
are
asking
questions
which
involve
a
correct
answer
to
two
others
completely
different
in
kind
from
one
another
we
must
know
what
degree
of
intrinsic
value
different
things
have
how
these
different
things
may
be
obtained
but
the
vast
majority
of
questions
which
have
actually
been
discussed
in
ethics
practical
questions
indeed
involve
this
double
knowledge
and
they
have
been
discussed
without
any
clear
separation
of
the
two
distinct
questions
involved
a
great
part
of
the
vast
disagreements
prevalent
in
ethics
is
to
be
attributed
to
this
failure
in
analysis
by
the
use
of
conceptions
which
involve
both
that
of
intrinsic
value
and
that
of
causal
relation
as
if
they
involved
intrinsic
value
only
two
different
errors
have
been
rendered
almost
universal
either
it
is
assumed
that
nothing
has
intrinsic
value
which
is
not
possible
or
else
it
is
assumed
that
what
is
necessary
must
have
intrinsic
value
hence
the
primary
and
peculiar
business
of
ethics
the
determination
what
things
have
intrinsic
value
and
in
what
degrees
has
received
no
adequate
treatment
at
all
and
on
the
other
hand
a
discussion
of
means
has
been
also
largely
neglected
owing
to
an
obscure
perception
of
the
truth
that
it
is
perfectly
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
intrinsic
values
but
however
this
may
be
and
however
strongly
any
particular
reader
may
be
convinced
that
some
one
of
the
mutually
contradictory
systems
which
hold
the
field
has
given
a
correct
answer
either
to
the
question
what
has
intrinsic
value
or
to
the
question
what
we
ought
to
do
or
to
both
it
must
at
least
be
admitted
that
the
questions
what
is
best
in
itself
and
what
will
bring
about
the
best
possible
are
utterly
distinct
that
both
belong
to
the
actual
of
ethics
and
that
the
more
clearly
distinct
questions
are
distinguished
the
better
is
our
chance
of
answering
both
correctly
there
remains
one
point
which
must
not
be
omitted
in
a
complete
description
of
the
kind
of
questions
which
ethics
has
to
answer
the
main
division
of
those
questions
is
as
i
have
said
into
two
the
question
what
things
are
good
in
themselves
and
the
question
to
what
other
things
these
are
related
as
effects
the
first
of
these
which
is
the
primary
ethical
question
and
is
presupposed
by
the
other
includes
a
correct
comparison
of
the
various
things
which
have
intrinsic
value
if
there
are
many
such
in
respect
of
the
degree
of
value
which
they
have
and
such
comparison
involves
a
difficulty
of
principle
which
has
greatly
aided
the
confusion
of
intrinsic
value
with
mere
goodness
as
a
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
one
difference
between
a
judgment
which
asserts
that
a
thing
is
good
in
itself
and
a
judgment
which
asserts
that
it
is
a
means
to
good
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
first
if
true
of
one
instance
of
the
thing
in
question
is
necessarily
true
of
all
whereas
a
thing
which
has
good
effects
under
some
circumstances
may
have
bad
ones
under
others
now
it
is
certainly
true
that
all
judgments
of
intrinsic
value
are
in
this
sense
universal
but
the
principle
which
i
have
now
to
enunciate
may
easily
make
it
appear
as
if
they
were
not
so
but
resembled
the
judgment
of
means
in
being
merely
general
there
is
as
will
presently
be
maintained
a
vast
number
of
different
things
each
of
which
has
intrinsic
value
there
are
also
very
many
which
are
positively
bad
and
there
is
a
still
larger
class
of
things
which
appear
to
be
indifferent
but
a
thing
belonging
to
any
of
these
three
classes
may
occur
as
part
of
a
whole
which
includes
among
its
other
parts
other
things
belonging
both
to
the
same
and
to
the
other
two
classes
and
these
wholes
as
such
may
also
have
intrinsic
value
the
paradox
to
which
it
is
necessary
to
call
attention
is
that
value
of
such
a
whole
bears
no
regular
proportion
to
the
sum
of
the
values
of
its
it
is
certain
that
a
good
thing
may
exist
in
such
a
relation
to
another
good
thing
that
the
value
of
the
whole
thus
formed
is
immensely
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
values
of
the
two
good
things
it
is
certain
that
a
whole
formed
of
a
good
thing
and
an
indifferent
thing
may
have
immensely
greater
value
than
that
good
thing
itself
possesses
it
is
certain
that
two
bad
things
or
a
bad
thing
and
an
indifferent
thing
may
form
a
whole
much
worse
than
the
sum
of
badness
of
its
parts
and
it
seems
as
if
indifferent
things
may
also
be
the
sole
constituents
of
a
whole
which
has
great
value
either
positive
or
negative
whether
the
addition
of
a
bad
thing
to
a
good
whole
may
increase
the
positive
value
of
the
whole
or
the
addition
of
a
bad
thing
to
a
bad
may
produce
a
whole
having
positive
value
may
seem
more
doubtful
but
it
is
at
least
possible
and
this
possibility
must
be
taken
into
account
in
our
ethical
investigations
however
we
may
decide
particular
questions
the
principle
is
clear
value
of
a
whole
must
not
be
assumed
to
be
the
same
as
the
sum
of
the
values
of
its
a
single
instance
will
suffice
to
illustrate
the
kind
of
relation
in
question
it
seems
to
be
true
that
to
be
conscious
of
a
beautiful
object
is
a
thing
of
great
intrinsic
value
whereas
the
same
object
if
no
one
be
conscious
of
it
has
certainly
comparatively
little
value
and
is
commonly
held
to
have
none
at
all
but
the
consciousness
of
a
beautiful
object
is
certainly
a
whole
of
some
sort
in
which
we
can
distinguish
as
parts
the
object
on
the
one
hand
and
the
being
conscious
on
the
other
now
this
latter
factor
occurs
as
part
of
a
different
whole
whenever
we
are
conscious
of
anything
and
it
would
seem
that
some
of
these
wholes
have
at
all
events
very
little
value
and
may
even
be
indifferent
or
positively
bad
yet
we
can
not
always
attribute
the
slightness
of
their
value
to
any
positive
demerit
in
the
object
which
differentiates
them
from
the
consciousness
of
beauty
the
object
itself
may
approach
as
near
as
possible
to
absolute
neutrality
since
therefore
mere
consciousness
does
not
always
confer
great
value
upon
the
whole
of
which
it
forms
a
part
even
though
its
object
may
have
no
great
demerit
we
can
not
attribute
the
great
superiority
of
the
consciousness
of
a
beautiful
thing
over
the
beautiful
thing
itself
to
the
mere
addition
of
the
value
of
consciousness
to
that
of
the
beautiful
thing
whatever
the
intrinsic
value
of
consciousness
may
be
it
does
not
give
to
the
whole
of
which
it
forms
a
part
a
value
proportioned
to
the
sum
of
its
value
and
that
of
its
object
if
this
be
so
we
have
here
an
instance
of
a
whole
possessing
a
different
intrinsic
value
from
the
sum
of
that
of
its
parts
and
whether
it
be
so
or
not
what
is
meant
by
such
a
difference
is
illustrated
by
this
case
there
are
then
wholes
which
possess
the
property
that
their
value
is
different
from
the
sum
of
the
values
of
their
parts
and
the
relations
which
subsist
between
such
parts
and
the
whole
of
which
they
form
a
part
have
not
hitherto
been
distinctly
recognised
or
received
a
separate
name
two
points
are
especially
worthy
of
notice
it
is
plain
that
the
existence
of
any
such
part
is
a
necessary
condition
for
the
existence
of
that
good
which
is
constituted
by
the
whole
and
exactly
the
same
language
will
also
express
the
relation
between
a
means
and
the
good
thing
which
is
its
effect
but
yet
there
is
a
most
important
difference
between
the
two
cases
constituted
by
the
fact
that
the
part
is
whereas
the
means
is
not
a
part
of
the
good
thing
for
the
existence
of
which
its
existence
is
a
necessary
condition
the
necessity
by
which
if
the
good
in
question
is
to
exist
the
means
to
it
must
exist
is
merely
a
natural
or
causal
necessity
if
the
laws
of
nature
were
different
exactly
the
same
good
might
exist
although
what
is
now
a
necessary
condition
of
its
existence
did
not
exist
the
existence
of
the
means
has
no
intrinsic
value
and
its
utter
annihilation
would
leave
the
value
of
that
which
it
is
now
necessary
to
secure
entirely
unchanged
but
in
the
case
of
a
part
of
such
a
whole
as
we
are
now
considering
it
is
otherwise
in
this
case
the
good
in
question
can
not
conceivably
exist
unless
the
part
exist
also
the
necessity
which
connects
the
two
is
quite
independent
of
natural
law
what
is
asserted
to
have
intrinsic
value
is
the
existence
of
the
whole
and
the
existence
of
the
whole
includes
the
existence
of
its
part
suppose
the
part
removed
and
what
remains
is
what
was
asserted
to
have
intrinsic
value
but
if
we
suppose
a
means
removed
what
remains
is
just
what
asserted
to
have
intrinsic
value
and
yet
the
existence
of
the
part
may
have
no
more
intrinsic
value
than
that
of
the
means
it
is
this
fact
which
constitutes
the
paradox
of
the
relation
which
we
are
discussing
it
has
just
been
said
that
what
has
intrinsic
value
is
the
existence
of
the
whole
and
that
this
includes
the
existence
of
the
part
and
from
this
it
would
seem
a
natural
inference
that
the
existence
of
the
part
has
intrinsic
value
but
the
inference
would
be
as
false
as
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
because
the
number
of
two
stones
was
two
each
of
the
stones
was
also
two
the
part
of
a
valuable
whole
retains
exactly
the
same
value
when
it
is
as
when
it
is
not
a
part
of
that
whole
if
it
had
value
under
other
circumstances
its
value
is
not
any
greater
when
it
is
part
of
a
far
more
valuable
whole
and
if
it
had
no
value
by
itself
it
has
none
still
however
great
be
that
of
the
whole
of
which
it
now
forms
a
part
we
are
not
then
justified
in
asserting
that
one
and
the
same
thing
is
under
some
circumstances
intrinsically
good
and
under
others
not
so
as
we
are
justified
in
asserting
of
a
means
that
it
sometimes
does
and
sometimes
does
not
produce
good
results
and
yet
we
are
justified
in
asserting
that
it
is
far
more
desirable
that
a
certain
thing
should
exist
under
some
circumstances
than
under
others
namely
when
other
things
will
exist
in
such
relations
to
it
as
to
form
a
more
valuable
whole
will
not
have
more
intrinsic
value
under
these
circumstances
than
under
others
will
not
necessarily
even
be
a
means
to
the
existence
of
things
having
more
intrinsic
value
but
it
will
like
a
means
be
a
necessary
condition
for
the
existence
of
that
which
greater
intrinsic
value
although
unlike
a
means
it
will
itself
form
a
part
of
this
more
valuable
existent
i
have
said
that
the
peculiar
relation
between
part
and
whole
which
i
have
just
been
trying
to
define
is
one
which
has
received
no
separate
name
it
would
however
be
useful
that
it
should
have
one
and
there
is
a
name
which
might
well
be
appropriated
to
it
if
only
it
could
be
divorced
from
its
present
unfortunate
usage
philosophers
especially
those
who
profess
to
have
derived
great
benefit
from
the
writings
of
hegel
have
latterly
made
much
use
of
the
terms
organic
whole
organic
unity
organic
the
reason
why
these
terms
might
well
be
appropriated
to
the
use
suggested
is
that
the
peculiar
relation
of
parts
to
whole
just
defined
is
one
of
the
properties
which
distinguishes
the
wholes
to
which
they
are
actually
applied
with
the
greatest
frequency
and
the
reason
why
it
is
desirable
that
they
should
be
divorced
from
their
present
usage
is
that
as
at
present
used
they
have
no
distinct
sense
and
on
the
contrary
both
imply
and
propagate
errors
of
confusion
to
say
that
a
thing
is
an
organic
whole
is
generally
understood
to
imply
that
its
parts
are
related
to
one
another
and
to
itself
as
means
to
end
it
is
also
understood
to
imply
that
they
have
a
property
described
in
some
such
phrase
as
that
they
have
no
meaning
or
significance
apart
from
the
whole
and
finally
such
a
whole
is
also
treated
as
if
it
had
the
property
to
which
i
am
proposing
that
the
name
should
be
confined
but
those
who
use
the
term
give
us
in
general
no
hint
as
to
how
they
suppose
these
three
properties
to
be
related
to
one
another
it
seems
generally
to
be
assumed
that
they
are
identical
and
always
at
least
that
they
are
necessarily
connected
with
one
another
that
they
are
not
identical
i
have
already
tried
to
shew
to
suppose
them
so
is
to
neglect
the
very
distinctions
pointed
out
in
the
last
paragraph
and
the
usage
might
well
be
discontinued
merely
because
it
encourages
such
neglect
but
a
still
more
cogent
reason
for
its
discontinuance
is
that
so
far
from
being
necessarily
connected
the
second
is
a
property
which
can
attach
to
nothing
being
a
conception
whereas
the
first
if
we
insist
on
its
most
important
sense
applies
to
many
cases
to
which
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
the
third
applies
also
and
the
third
certainly
applies
to
many
to
which
the
first
does
not
apply
these
relations
between
the
three
properties
just
distinguished
may
be
illustrated
by
reference
to
a
whole
of
the
kind
from
which
the
name
organic
was
derived
a
whole
which
is
an
organism
in
the
scientific
sense
namely
the
human
body
there
exists
between
many
parts
of
our
body
though
not
between
all
a
relation
which
has
been
familiarised
by
the
fable
attributed
to
menenius
agrippa
concerning
the
belly
and
its
members
we
can
find
in
it
parts
such
that
the
continued
existence
of
the
one
is
a
necessary
condition
for
the
continued
existence
of
the
other
while
the
continued
existence
of
this
latter
is
also
a
necessary
condition
for
the
continued
existence
of
the
former
this
amounts
to
no
more
than
saying
that
in
the
body
we
have
instances
of
two
things
both
enduring
for
some
time
which
have
a
relation
of
mutual
causal
dependence
on
one
another
a
relation
of
frequently
no
more
than
this
is
meant
by
saying
that
the
parts
of
the
body
form
an
organic
unity
or
that
they
are
mutually
means
and
ends
to
one
another
and
we
certainly
have
here
a
striking
characteristic
of
living
things
but
it
would
be
extremely
rash
to
assert
that
this
relation
of
mutual
causal
dependence
was
only
exhibited
by
living
things
and
hence
was
sufficient
to
define
their
peculiarity
and
it
is
obvious
that
of
two
things
which
have
this
relation
of
mutual
dependence
neither
may
have
intrinsic
value
or
one
may
have
it
and
the
other
lack
it
they
are
not
necessarily
ends
to
one
another
in
any
sense
except
that
in
which
end
means
and
moreover
it
is
plain
that
in
this
sense
the
whole
can
not
be
an
end
to
any
of
its
parts
we
are
apt
to
talk
of
the
whole
in
contrast
to
one
of
its
parts
when
in
fact
we
mean
only
of
the
parts
but
strictly
the
whole
must
include
all
its
parts
and
no
part
can
be
a
cause
of
the
whole
because
it
can
not
be
a
cause
of
itself
it
is
plain
therefore
that
this
relation
of
mutual
causal
dependence
implies
nothing
with
regard
to
the
value
of
either
of
the
objects
which
have
it
and
that
even
if
both
of
them
happen
also
to
have
value
this
relation
between
them
is
one
which
can
not
hold
between
part
and
whole
but
it
may
also
be
the
case
that
our
body
as
a
whole
has
a
value
greater
than
the
sum
of
values
of
its
parts
and
this
may
be
what
is
meant
when
it
is
said
that
the
parts
are
means
to
the
whole
it
is
obvious
that
if
we
ask
the
question
why
the
parts
be
such
as
they
are
a
proper
answer
may
be
because
the
whole
they
form
has
so
much
but
it
is
equally
obvious
that
the
relation
which
we
thus
assert
to
exist
between
part
and
whole
is
quite
different
from
that
which
we
assert
to
exist
between
part
and
part
when
we
say
this
part
exists
because
that
one
could
not
exist
without
in
the
latter
case
we
assert
the
two
parts
to
be
causally
connected
but
in
the
former
part
and
whole
can
not
be
causally
connected
and
the
relation
which
we
assert
to
exist
between
them
may
exist
even
though
the
parts
are
not
causally
connected
either
all
the
parts
of
a
picture
do
not
have
that
relation
of
mutual
causal
dependence
which
certain
parts
of
the
body
have
and
yet
the
existence
of
those
which
do
not
have
it
may
be
absolutely
essential
to
the
value
of
the
whole
the
two
relations
are
quite
distinct
in
kind
and
we
can
not
infer
the
existence
of
the
one
from
that
of
the
other
it
can
therefore
serve
no
useful
purpose
to
include
them
both
under
the
same
name
and
if
we
are
to
say
that
a
whole
is
organic
because
its
parts
are
in
this
sense
means
to
the
whole
we
must
say
that
it
is
organic
because
its
parts
are
causally
dependent
on
one
another
but
finally
the
sense
which
has
been
most
prominent
in
recent
uses
of
the
term
organic
whole
is
one
whereby
it
asserts
the
parts
of
such
a
whole
to
have
a
property
which
the
parts
of
no
whole
can
possibly
have
it
is
supposed
that
just
as
the
whole
would
not
be
what
it
is
but
for
the
existence
of
the
parts
so
the
parts
would
not
be
what
they
are
but
for
the
existence
of
the
whole
and
this
is
understood
to
mean
not
merely
that
any
particular
part
could
not
exist
unless
the
others
existed
too
which
is
the
case
where
relation
exists
between
the
parts
but
actually
that
the
part
is
no
distinct
object
of
thought
that
the
whole
of
which
it
is
a
part
is
in
its
turn
a
part
of
it
that
this
supposition
is
a
very
little
reflection
should
be
sufficient
to
shew
we
may
admit
indeed
that
when
a
particular
thing
is
a
part
of
a
whole
it
does
possess
a
predicate
which
it
would
not
otherwise
possess
namely
that
it
is
a
part
of
that
whole
but
what
can
not
be
admitted
is
that
this
predicate
alters
the
nature
or
enters
into
the
definition
of
the
thing
which
has
it
when
we
think
of
the
part
we
mean
just
we
assert
in
this
case
to
the
predicate
that
it
is
part
of
the
whole
and
the
mere
assertion
that
is
a
part
of
the
whole
involves
that
it
should
itself
be
distinct
from
that
which
we
assert
of
it
otherwise
we
contradict
ourselves
since
we
assert
that
not
but
something
else
namely
it
together
with
that
which
we
assert
of
it
has
the
predicate
which
we
assert
of
it
in
short
it
is
obvious
that
no
part
contains
analytically
the
whole
to
which
it
belongs
or
any
other
parts
of
that
whole
the
relation
of
part
to
whole
is
the
same
as
that
of
whole
to
part
and
the
very
definition
of
the
latter
is
that
it
does
contain
analytically
that
which
is
said
to
be
its
part
and
yet
this
very
doctrine
is
the
chief
mark
which
shews
the
influence
of
hegel
upon
modern
philosophy
an
influence
which
pervades
almost
the
whole
of
orthodox
philosophy
this
is
what
is
generally
implied
by
the
cry
against
falsification
by
abstraction
that
a
whole
is
always
a
part
of
its
part
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
about
a
part
we
are
told
you
must
consider
that
part
but
something
else
namely
the
whole
is
true
of
the
part
but
only
of
the
yet
plainly
it
must
be
true
of
the
part
at
least
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
whole
and
it
is
obvious
that
when
we
say
it
is
we
do
mean
merely
that
the
whole
is
a
part
of
itself
this
doctrine
therefore
that
a
part
can
have
no
meaning
or
significance
apart
from
its
whole
must
be
utterly
rejected
it
implies
itself
that
the
statement
this
is
a
part
of
that
whole
has
a
meaning
and
in
order
that
this
may
have
one
both
subject
and
predicate
must
have
a
distinct
meaning
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
this
false
doctrine
has
arisen
by
confusion
with
the
two
relations
and
which
may
really
be
properties
of
wholes
the
of
a
part
may
be
connected
by
a
natural
or
causal
necessity
with
the
existence
of
the
other
parts
of
its
whole
and
further
what
is
a
part
of
a
whole
and
what
has
ceased
to
be
such
a
part
although
differing
intrinsically
from
one
another
may
be
called
by
one
and
the
same
name
thus
to
take
a
typical
example
if
an
arm
be
cut
off
from
the
human
body
we
still
call
it
an
arm
yet
an
arm
when
it
is
a
part
of
the
body
undoubtedly
differs
from
a
dead
arm
and
hence
we
may
easily
be
led
to
say
the
arm
which
is
a
part
of
the
body
would
not
be
what
it
is
if
it
were
not
such
a
part
and
to
think
that
the
contradiction
thus
expressed
is
in
reality
a
characteristic
of
things
but
in
fact
the
dead
arm
never
was
a
part
of
the
body
it
is
only
identical
with
the
living
arm
those
parts
of
it
which
are
identical
with
parts
of
the
living
arm
are
exactly
the
same
whether
they
belong
to
the
body
or
not
and
in
them
we
have
an
undeniable
instance
of
one
and
the
same
thing
at
one
time
forming
a
part
and
at
another
not
forming
a
part
of
the
presumed
organic
on
the
other
hand
those
properties
which
possessed
by
the
living
and
by
the
dead
arm
do
not
exist
in
a
changed
form
in
the
latter
they
simply
do
not
exist
there
by
a
causal
necessity
their
existence
depends
on
their
having
that
relation
to
the
other
parts
of
the
body
which
we
express
by
saying
that
they
form
part
of
it
yet
most
certainly
they
ever
did
not
form
part
of
the
body
they
be
exactly
what
they
are
when
they
do
that
they
differ
intrinsically
from
the
properties
of
the
dead
arm
and
that
they
form
part
of
the
body
are
propositions
not
analytically
related
to
one
another
there
is
no
contradiction
in
supposing
them
to
retain
such
intrinsic
differences
and
yet
not
to
form
part
of
the
body
but
when
we
are
told
that
a
living
arm
has
no
or
apart
from
the
body
to
which
it
belongs
a
different
fallacy
is
also
suggested
to
have
meaning
or
significance
is
commonly
used
in
the
sense
of
to
have
importance
and
this
again
means
to
have
value
either
as
a
means
or
as
an
now
it
is
quite
possible
that
even
a
living
arm
apart
from
its
body
would
have
no
intrinsic
value
whatever
although
the
whole
of
which
it
is
a
part
has
great
intrinsic
value
owing
to
its
presence
thus
we
may
easily
come
to
say
that
a
part
of
the
body
it
has
great
value
whereas
it
would
have
none
and
thus
that
its
whole
meaning
lies
in
its
relation
to
the
body
but
in
fact
the
value
in
question
obviously
does
not
belong
to
at
all
to
have
value
merely
as
a
part
is
equivalent
to
having
no
value
at
all
but
merely
being
a
part
of
that
which
has
it
owing
however
to
neglect
of
this
distinction
the
assertion
that
a
part
has
value
a
which
it
would
not
otherwise
have
easily
leads
to
the
assumption
that
it
is
also
different
as
a
part
from
what
it
would
otherwise
be
for
it
is
in
fact
true
that
two
things
which
have
a
different
value
must
also
differ
in
other
respects
hence
the
assumption
that
one
and
the
same
thing
because
it
is
a
part
of
a
more
valuable
whole
at
one
time
than
at
another
therefore
has
more
intrinsic
value
at
one
time
than
at
another
has
encouraged
the
belief
that
one
and
the
same
thing
may
be
two
different
things
and
that
only
in
one
of
its
forms
is
it
truly
what
it
is
for
these
reasons
i
shall
where
it
seems
convenient
take
the
liberty
to
use
the
term
organic
with
a
special
sense
i
shall
use
it
to
denote
the
fact
that
a
whole
has
an
intrinsic
value
different
in
amount
from
the
sum
of
the
values
of
its
parts
i
shall
use
it
to
denote
this
and
only
this
the
term
will
not
imply
any
causal
relation
whatever
between
the
parts
of
the
whole
in
question
and
it
will
not
imply
either
that
the
parts
are
inconceivable
except
as
parts
of
that
whole
or
that
when
they
form
parts
of
such
a
whole
they
have
a
value
different
from
that
which
they
would
have
if
they
did
not
understood
in
this
special
and
perfectly
definite
sense
the
relation
of
an
organic
whole
to
its
parts
is
one
of
the
most
important
which
ethics
has
to
recognise
a
chief
part
of
that
science
should
be
occupied
in
comparing
the
relative
values
of
various
goods
and
the
grossest
errors
will
be
committed
in
such
comparison
if
it
be
assumed
that
wherever
two
things
form
a
whole
the
value
of
that
whole
is
merely
the
sum
of
the
values
of
those
two
things
with
this
question
of
organic
wholes
then
we
complete
the
enumeration
of
the
kind
of
problems
with
which
it
is
the
business
of
ethics
to
deal
in
this
chapter
i
have
endeavoured
to
enforce
the
following
conclusions
the
peculiarity
of
ethics
is
not
that
it
investigates
assertions
about
human
conduct
but
that
it
investigates
assertions
about
that
property
of
things
which
is
denoted
by
the
term
good
and
the
converse
property
denoted
by
the
term
it
must
in
order
to
establish
its
conclusions
investigate
the
truth
of
such
assertions
those
which
assert
the
relation
of
this
property
only
to
a
single
existent
this
property
by
reference
to
which
the
of
ethics
must
be
defined
is
itself
simple
and
indefinable
and
all
assertions
about
its
relation
to
other
things
are
of
two
and
only
two
kinds
they
either
assert
in
what
degree
things
themselves
possess
this
property
or
else
they
assert
causal
relations
between
other
things
and
those
which
possess
it
finally
in
considering
the
different
degrees
in
which
things
themselves
possess
this
property
we
have
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
a
whole
may
possess
it
in
a
degree
different
from
that
which
is
obtained
by
summing
the
degrees
in
which
its
parts
possess

conclusions
of
chapter
i
that
all
ethical
questions
fall
under
one
or
other
of
three
classes
the
first
class
contains
but
one
question
the
question
what
is
the
nature
of
that
peculiar
predicate
the
relation
of
which
to
other
things
constitutes
the
object
of
all
other
ethical
investigations
or
in
other
words
what
is
by
good
this
first
question
i
have
already
attempted
to
answer
the
peculiar
predicate
by
reference
to
which
the
sphere
of
ethics
must
be
defined
is
simple
unanalysable
indefinable
there
remain
two
classes
of
questions
with
regard
to
the
relation
of
this
predicate
to
other
things
we
may
ask
either
to
what
things
and
in
what
degree
does
this
predicate
directly
attach
what
things
are
good
in
themselves
or
by
what
means
shall
we
be
able
to
make
what
exists
in
the
world
as
good
as
possible
what
causal
relations
hold
between
what
is
best
in
itself
and
other
things
in
this
and
the
two
following
chapters
i
propose
to
discuss
certain
theories
which
offer
us
an
answer
to
the
question
what
is
good
in
itself
i
say
advisedly
answer
for
these
theories
are
all
characterised
by
the
fact
that
if
true
they
would
simplify
the
study
of
ethics
very
much
they
all
hold
that
there
is
only
kind
of
fact
of
which
the
existence
has
any
value
at
all
but
they
all
also
possess
another
characteristic
which
is
my
reason
for
grouping
them
together
and
treating
them
first
namely
that
the
main
reason
why
the
single
kind
of
fact
they
name
has
been
held
to
define
the
sole
good
is
that
it
has
been
held
to
define
what
is
meant
by
good
itself
in
other
words
they
are
all
theories
of
the
end
or
ideal
the
adoption
of
which
has
been
chiefly
caused
by
the
commission
of
what
i
have
called
the
naturalistic
fallacy
they
all
confuse
the
first
and
second
of
the
three
possible
questions
which
ethics
can
ask
it
is
indeed
this
fact
which
explains
their
contention
that
only
a
single
kind
of
thing
is
good
that
a
thing
should
be
good
it
has
been
thought
that
it
possesses
this
single
property
and
hence
it
is
thought
only
what
possesses
this
property
is
good
the
inference
seems
very
natural
and
yet
what
is
meant
by
it
is
for
those
who
make
it
fail
to
perceive
that
their
conclusion
what
possesses
this
property
is
good
is
a
significant
proposition
that
it
does
not
mean
either
what
possesses
this
property
possesses
this
property
or
the
word
good
denotes
that
a
thing
possesses
this
and
yet
if
it
does
mean
one
or
other
of
these
two
things
the
inference
contradicts
its
own
premise
i
propose
therefore
to
discuss
certain
theories
of
what
is
good
in
itself
which
are
on
the
naturalistic
fallacy
in
the
sense
that
the
commission
of
this
fallacy
has
been
the
main
cause
of
their
wide
acceptance
the
discussion
will
be
designed
both
further
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
the
naturalistic
fallacy
is
a
fallacy
or
in
other
words
that
we
are
all
aware
of
a
certain
simple
quality
which
and
not
anything
else
is
what
we
mainly
mean
by
the
term
good
and
to
shew
that
not
one
but
many
different
things
possess
this
property
for
i
can
not
hope
to
recommend
the
doctrine
that
things
which
are
good
do
not
owe
their
goodness
to
their
common
possession
of
any
other
property
without
a
criticism
of
the
main
doctrines
opposed
to
this
whose
power
to
recommend
themselves
is
proved
by
their
wide
prevalence
the
theories
i
propose
to
discuss
may
be
conveniently
divided
into
two
groups
the
naturalistic
fallacy
always
implies
that
when
we
think
this
is
good
what
we
are
thinking
is
that
the
thing
in
question
bears
a
definite
relation
to
some
one
other
thing
but
this
one
thing
by
reference
to
which
good
is
defined
may
be
either
what
i
may
call
a
natural
object
something
of
which
the
existence
is
admittedly
an
object
of
experience
or
else
it
may
be
an
object
which
is
only
inferred
to
exist
in
a
supersensible
real
world
these
two
types
of
ethical
theory
i
propose
to
treat
separately
theories
of
the
second
type
may
conveniently
be
called
metaphysical
and
i
shall
postpone
consideration
of
them
till
chapter
iv
in
this
and
the
following
chapter
on
the
other
hand
i
shall
deal
with
theories
which
owe
their
prevalence
to
the
supposition
that
good
can
be
defined
by
reference
to
a
and
these
are
what
i
mean
by
the
name
which
gives
the
title
to
this
chapter
naturalistic
it
should
be
observed
that
the
fallacy
by
reference
to
which
i
define
metaphysical
ethics
is
the
same
in
kind
and
i
give
it
but
one
name
the
naturalistic
fallacy
but
when
we
regard
the
ethical
theories
recommended
by
this
fallacy
it
seems
convenient
to
distinguish
those
which
consider
goodness
to
consist
in
a
relation
to
something
which
exists
here
and
now
from
those
which
do
not
according
to
the
former
ethics
is
an
empirical
or
positive
science
its
conclusions
could
be
all
established
by
means
of
empirical
observation
and
induction
but
this
is
not
the
case
with
metaphysical
ethics
there
is
therefore
a
marked
distinction
between
these
two
groups
of
ethical
theories
based
on
the
same
fallacy
and
within
naturalistic
theories
too
a
convenient
division
may
also
be
made
there
is
one
natural
object
namely
pleasure
which
has
perhaps
been
as
frequently
held
to
be
the
sole
good
as
all
the
rest
put
together
and
there
is
moreover
a
further
reason
for
treating
hedonism
separately
that
doctrine
has
i
think
as
plainly
as
any
other
owed
its
prevalence
to
the
naturalistic
fallacy
but
it
has
had
a
singular
fate
in
that
the
writer
who
first
clearly
exposed
the
fallacy
of
the
naturalistic
arguments
by
which
it
had
been
attempted
to
that
pleasure
was
the
sole
good
has
maintained
that
nevertheless
it
the
sole
good
i
propose
therefore
to
divide
my
discussion
of
hedonism
from
that
of
other
naturalistic
theories
treating
of
naturalistic
ethics
in
general
in
this
chapter
and
of
hedonism
in
particular
in
the
next
the
subject
of
the
present
chapter
is
then
ethical
theories
which
declare
that
no
intrinsic
value
is
to
be
found
except
in
the
possession
of
some
one
property
other
than
pleasure
and
which
declare
this
because
it
is
supposed
that
to
be
good
to
possess
the
property
in
question
such
theories
i
call
i
have
thus
appropriated
the
name
naturalism
to
a
particular
method
of
approaching
ethics
a
method
which
strictly
understood
is
inconsistent
with
the
possibility
of
any
ethics
whatsoever
this
method
consists
in
substituting
for
good
some
one
property
of
a
natural
object
or
of
a
collection
of
natural
objects
and
in
thus
replacing
ethics
by
some
one
of
the
natural
sciences
in
general
the
science
thus
substituted
is
one
of
the
sciences
specially
concerned
with
man
owing
to
the
general
mistake
for
such
i
hold
it
to
be
of
regarding
the
matter
of
ethics
as
confined
to
human
conduct
in
general
psychology
has
been
the
science
substituted
as
by
mill
or
sociology
as
by
professor
clifford
and
other
modern
writers
but
any
other
science
might
equally
well
be
substituted
it
is
the
same
fallacy
which
is
implied
when
professor
tyndall
recommends
us
to
conform
to
the
laws
of
matter
and
here
the
science
which
it
is
proposed
to
substitute
for
ethics
is
simply
physics
the
name
then
is
perfectly
general
for
no
matter
what
the
something
is
that
good
is
held
to
mean
the
theory
is
still
naturalism
whether
good
be
defined
as
yellow
or
green
or
blue
as
loud
or
soft
as
round
or
square
as
sweet
or
bitter
as
productive
of
life
or
productive
of
pleasure
as
willed
or
desired
or
felt
whichever
of
these
or
of
any
other
object
in
the
world
good
may
be
held
to
the
theory
which
holds
it
to
them
will
be
a
naturalistic
theory
i
have
called
such
theories
naturalistic
because
all
of
these
terms
denote
properties
simple
or
complex
of
some
simple
or
complex
natural
object
and
before
i
proceed
to
consider
them
it
will
be
well
to
define
what
is
meant
by
nature
and
by
natural
by
nature
then
i
do
mean
and
have
meant
that
which
is
the
of
the
natural
sciences
and
also
of
psychology
it
may
be
said
to
include
all
that
has
existed
does
exist
or
will
exist
in
time
if
we
consider
whether
any
object
is
of
such
a
nature
that
it
may
be
said
to
exist
now
to
have
existed
or
to
be
about
to
exist
then
we
may
know
that
that
object
is
a
natural
object
and
that
nothing
of
which
this
is
not
true
is
a
natural
object
thus
for
instance
of
our
minds
we
should
say
that
they
did
exist
yesterday
that
they
do
exist
and
probably
will
exist
in
a
minute
or
two
we
shall
say
that
we
had
thoughts
yesterday
which
have
ceased
to
exist
now
although
their
effects
may
remain
and
in
so
far
as
those
thoughts
did
exist
they
too
are
natural
objects
there
is
indeed
no
difficulty
about
the
objects
themselves
in
the
sense
in
which
i
have
just
used
the
term
it
is
easy
to
say
which
of
them
are
natural
and
which
if
any
are
not
natural
but
when
we
begin
to
consider
the
properties
of
objects
then
i
fear
the
problem
is
more
difficult
which
among
the
properties
of
natural
objects
are
natural
properties
and
which
are
not
for
i
do
not
deny
that
good
is
a
property
of
certain
natural
objects
certain
of
them
i
think
good
and
yet
i
have
said
that
good
itself
is
not
a
natural
property
well
my
test
for
these
too
also
concerns
their
existence
in
time
can
we
imagine
good
as
existing
in
time
and
not
merely
as
a
property
of
some
natural
object
for
myself
i
can
not
so
imagine
it
whereas
with
the
greater
number
of
properties
of
objects
those
which
i
call
the
natural
properties
their
existence
does
seem
to
me
to
be
independent
of
the
existence
of
those
objects
they
are
in
fact
rather
parts
of
which
the
object
is
made
up
than
mere
predicates
which
attach
to
it
if
they
were
all
taken
away
no
object
would
be
left
not
even
a
bare
substance
for
they
are
in
themselves
substantial
and
give
to
the
object
all
the
substance
that
it
has
but
this
is
not
so
with
good
if
indeed
good
were
a
feeling
as
some
would
have
us
believe
then
it
would
exist
in
time
but
that
is
why
to
call
it
so
is
to
commit
the
naturalistic
fallacy
it
will
always
remain
pertinent
to
ask
whether
the
feeling
itself
is
good
and
if
so
then
good
can
not
itself
be
identical
with
any
feeling
those
theories
of
ethics
then
are
naturalistic
which
declare
the
sole
good
to
consist
in
some
one
property
of
things
which
exists
in
time
and
which
do
so
because
they
suppose
that
good
itself
can
be
defined
by
reference
to
such
a
property
and
we
may
now
proceed
to
consider
such
theories
and
first
of
all
one
of
the
most
famous
of
ethical
maxims
is
that
which
recommends
a
life
according
to
that
was
the
principle
of
the
stoic
ethics
but
since
their
ethics
has
some
claim
to
be
called
metaphysical
i
shall
not
attempt
to
deal
with
it
here
but
the
same
phrase
reappears
in
rousseau
and
it
is
not
unfrequently
maintained
even
now
that
what
we
ought
to
do
is
to
live
naturally
now
let
us
examine
this
contention
in
its
general
form
it
is
obvious
in
the
first
place
that
we
can
not
say
that
everything
natural
is
good
except
perhaps
in
virtue
of
some
metaphysical
theory
such
as
i
shall
deal
with
later
if
everything
natural
is
equally
good
then
certainly
ethics
as
it
is
ordinarily
understood
disappears
for
nothing
is
more
certain
from
an
ethical
point
of
view
than
that
some
things
are
bad
and
others
good
the
object
of
ethics
is
indeed
in
chief
part
to
give
you
general
rules
whereby
you
may
avoid
the
one
and
secure
the
other
what
then
does
natural
mean
in
this
advice
to
live
naturally
since
it
obviously
can
not
apply
to
everything
that
is
natural
the
phrase
seems
to
point
to
a
vague
notion
that
there
is
some
such
thing
as
natural
good
to
a
belief
that
nature
may
be
said
to
fix
and
decide
what
shall
be
good
just
as
she
fixes
and
decides
what
shall
exist
for
instance
it
may
be
supposed
that
health
is
susceptible
of
a
natural
definition
that
nature
has
fixed
what
health
shall
be
and
health
it
may
be
said
is
obviously
good
hence
in
this
case
nature
has
decided
the
matter
we
have
only
to
go
to
her
and
ask
her
what
health
is
and
we
shall
know
what
is
good
we
shall
have
based
an
ethics
upon
science
but
what
is
this
natural
definition
of
health
i
can
only
conceive
that
health
should
be
defined
in
natural
terms
as
the
state
of
an
organism
for
undoubtedly
disease
is
also
a
natural
product
to
say
that
health
is
what
is
preserved
by
evolution
and
what
itself
tends
to
preserve
in
the
struggle
for
existence
the
organism
which
possesses
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
for
the
point
of
evolution
is
that
it
pretends
to
give
a
causal
explanation
of
why
some
forms
of
life
are
normal
and
others
are
abnormal
it
explains
the
origin
of
species
when
therefore
we
are
told
that
health
is
natural
we
may
presume
that
what
is
meant
is
that
it
is
normal
and
that
when
we
are
told
to
pursue
health
as
a
natural
end
what
is
implied
is
that
the
normal
must
be
good
but
is
it
so
obvious
that
the
normal
must
be
good
is
it
really
obvious
that
health
for
instance
is
good
was
the
excellence
of
socrates
or
of
shakespeare
normal
was
it
not
rather
abnormal
extraordinary
it
is
i
think
obvious
in
the
first
place
that
not
all
that
is
good
is
normal
that
on
the
contrary
the
abnormal
is
often
better
than
the
normal
peculiar
excellence
as
well
as
peculiar
viciousness
must
obviously
be
not
normal
but
abnormal
yet
it
may
be
said
that
nevertheless
the
normal
is
good
and
i
myself
am
not
prepared
to
dispute
that
health
is
good
what
i
contend
is
that
this
must
not
be
taken
to
be
obvious
that
it
must
be
regarded
as
an
open
question
to
declare
it
to
be
obvious
is
to
suggest
the
naturalistic
fallacy
just
as
in
some
recent
books
a
proof
that
genius
is
diseased
abnormal
has
been
used
in
order
to
suggest
that
genius
ought
not
to
be
encouraged
such
reasoning
is
fallacious
and
dangerously
fallacious
the
fact
is
that
in
the
very
words
health
and
disease
we
do
commonly
include
the
notion
that
the
one
is
good
and
the
other
bad
but
when
a
scientific
definition
of
them
is
attempted
a
definition
in
natural
terms
the
only
one
possible
is
that
by
way
of
normal
and
now
it
is
easy
to
prove
that
some
things
commonly
thought
excellent
are
abnormal
and
it
follows
that
they
are
diseased
but
it
does
not
follow
except
by
virtue
of
the
naturalistic
fallacy
that
those
things
commonly
thought
good
are
therefore
bad
all
that
has
really
been
shewn
is
that
in
some
cases
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
common
judgment
that
genius
is
good
and
the
common
judgment
that
health
is
good
it
is
not
sufficiently
recognised
that
the
latter
judgment
has
not
a
whit
more
warrant
for
its
truth
than
the
former
that
both
are
perfectly
open
questions
it
may
be
true
indeed
that
by
healthy
we
do
commonly
imply
good
but
that
only
shews
that
when
we
so
use
the
word
we
do
not
mean
the
same
thing
by
it
as
the
thing
which
is
meant
in
medical
science
that
health
the
word
is
used
to
denote
something
good
is
good
goes
no
way
at
all
to
shew
that
health
when
the
word
is
used
to
denote
something
normal
is
also
good
we
might
as
well
say
that
because
bull
denotes
an
irish
joke
and
also
a
certain
animal
the
joke
and
the
animal
must
be
the
same
thing
we
must
not
therefore
be
frightened
by
the
assertion
that
a
thing
is
natural
into
the
admission
that
it
is
good
good
does
not
by
definition
mean
anything
that
is
natural
and
it
is
therefore
always
an
open
question
whether
anything
that
is
natural
is
good
but
there
is
another
slightly
different
sense
in
which
the
word
natural
is
used
with
an
implication
that
it
denotes
something
good
this
is
when
we
speak
of
natural
affections
or
unnatural
crimes
and
vices
here
the
meaning
seems
to
be
not
so
much
that
the
action
or
feeling
in
question
is
normal
or
abnormal
as
that
it
is
necessary
it
is
in
this
connection
that
we
are
advised
to
imitate
savages
and
beasts
curious
advice
certainly
but
of
course
there
may
be
something
in
it
i
am
not
here
concerned
to
enquire
under
what
circumstances
some
of
us
might
with
advantage
take
a
lesson
from
the
cow
i
have
really
no
doubt
that
such
exist
what
i
am
concerned
with
is
a
certain
kind
of
reason
which
i
think
is
sometimes
used
to
support
this
doctrine
a
naturalistic
reason
the
notion
sometimes
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
minds
of
preachers
of
this
gospel
is
that
we
can
not
improve
on
nature
this
notion
is
certainly
true
in
the
sense
that
anything
we
can
do
that
may
be
better
than
the
present
state
of
things
will
be
a
natural
product
but
that
is
not
what
is
meant
by
this
phrase
nature
is
again
used
to
mean
a
mere
part
of
nature
only
this
time
the
part
meant
is
not
so
much
the
normal
as
an
arbitrary
minimum
of
what
is
necessary
for
life
and
when
this
minimum
is
recommended
as
natural
as
the
way
of
life
to
which
nature
points
her
finger
then
the
naturalistic
fallacy
is
used
against
this
position
i
wish
only
to
point
out
that
though
the
performance
of
certain
acts
not
in
themselves
desirable
may
be
as
necessary
means
to
the
preservation
of
life
that
is
no
reason
for
them
or
advising
us
to
limit
ourselves
to
those
simple
actions
which
are
necessary
if
it
is
possible
for
us
to
improve
our
condition
even
at
the
expense
of
doing
what
is
in
this
sense
unnecessary
nature
does
indeed
set
limits
to
what
is
possible
she
does
control
the
means
we
have
at
our
disposal
for
obtaining
what
is
good
and
of
this
fact
practical
ethics
as
we
shall
see
later
must
certainly
take
account
but
when
she
is
supposed
to
have
a
preference
for
what
is
necessary
what
is
necessary
means
only
what
is
necessary
to
obtain
a
certain
end
presupposed
as
the
highest
good
and
what
the
highest
good
is
nature
can
not
determine
why
should
we
suppose
that
what
is
merely
necessary
to
life
is
better
than
what
is
necessary
to
the
study
of
metaphysics
useless
as
that
study
may
appear
it
may
be
that
life
is
only
worth
living
because
it
enables
us
to
study
metaphysics
is
a
necessary
means
thereto
the
fallacy
of
this
argument
from
nature
has
been
discovered
as
long
ago
as
lucian
i
was
almost
inclined
to
laugh
says
callicratidas
in
one
of
the
dialogues
imputed
to
him
just
now
when
charicles
was
praising
irrational
brutes
and
the
savagery
of
the
scythians
in
the
heat
of
his
argument
he
was
almost
repenting
that
he
was
born
a
greek
what
wonder
if
lions
and
bears
and
pigs
do
not
act
as
i
was
proposing
that
which
reasoning
would
fairly
lead
a
man
to
choose
can
not
be
had
by
creatures
that
do
not
reason
simply
because
they
are
so
stupid
if
prometheus
or
some
other
god
had
given
each
of
them
the
intelligence
of
a
man
then
they
would
not
have
lived
in
deserts
and
mountains
nor
fed
on
one
another
they
would
have
built
temples
just
as
we
do
each
would
have
lived
in
the
centre
of
his
family
and
they
would
have
formed
a
nation
bound
by
mutual
laws
is
it
anything
surprising
that
brutes
who
have
had
the
misfortune
to
be
unable
to
obtain
by
forethought
any
of
the
goods
with
which
reasoning
provides
us
should
have
missed
love
too
lions
do
not
love
but
neither
do
they
philosophise
bears
do
not
love
but
the
reason
is
they
do
not
know
the
sweets
of
friendship
it
is
only
men
who
by
their
wisdom
and
their
knowledge
after
many
trials
have
chosen
what
is
ἔρωτες
to
argue
that
a
thing
is
good
it
is
natural
or
bad
it
is
unnatural
in
these
common
senses
of
the
term
is
therefore
certainly
fallacious
and
yet
such
arguments
are
very
frequently
used
but
they
do
not
commonly
pretend
to
give
a
systematic
theory
of
ethics
among
attempts
to
an
appeal
to
nature
that
which
is
now
most
prevalent
is
to
be
found
in
the
application
to
ethical
questions
of
the
term
evolution
in
the
ethical
doctrines
which
have
been
called
these
doctrines
are
those
which
maintain
that
the
course
of
evolution
while
it
shews
us
the
direction
in
which
we
developing
thereby
and
for
that
reason
shews
us
the
direction
in
which
we
to
develop
writers
who
maintain
such
a
doctrine
are
at
present
very
numerous
and
very
popular
and
i
propose
to
take
as
my
example
the
writer
who
is
perhaps
the
best
known
of
them
all
mr
herbert
spencer
mr
spencer
s
doctrine
it
must
be
owned
does
not
offer
the
example
of
the
naturalistic
fallacy
as
used
in
support
of
evolutionistic
ethics
a
clearer
example
might
be
found
in
the
doctrine
of
guyau
a
writer
who
has
lately
had
considerable
vogue
in
france
but
who
is
not
so
well
known
as
spencer
guyau
might
almost
be
called
a
disciple
of
spencer
he
is
frankly
evolutionistic
and
frankly
naturalistic
and
i
may
mention
that
he
does
not
seem
to
think
that
he
differs
from
spencer
by
reason
of
his
naturalism
the
point
in
which
he
has
criticised
spencer
concerns
the
question
how
far
the
ends
of
pleasure
and
of
increased
life
coincide
as
motives
and
means
to
the
attainment
of
the
ideal
he
does
not
seem
to
think
that
he
differs
from
spencer
in
the
fundamental
principle
that
the
ideal
is
quantity
of
life
measured
in
breadth
as
well
as
in
length
or
as
guyau
says
expansion
and
intensity
of
life
nor
in
the
naturalistic
reason
which
he
gives
for
this
principle
and
i
am
not
sure
that
he
does
differ
from
spencer
in
these
points
spencer
does
as
i
shall
shew
use
the
naturalistic
fallacy
in
details
but
with
regard
to
his
fundamental
principles
the
following
doubts
occur
is
he
fundamentally
a
hedonist
and
if
so
is
he
a
naturalistic
hedonist
in
that
case
he
would
better
have
been
treated
in
my
next
chapter
does
he
hold
that
a
tendency
to
increase
quantity
of
life
is
merely
a
of
good
conduct
or
does
he
hold
that
such
increase
of
life
is
marked
out
by
nature
as
an
end
at
which
we
ought
to
aim

i
think
his
language
in
various
places
would
give
colour
to
all
these
hypotheses
though
some
of
them
are
mutually
inconsistent
i
will
try
to
discuss
the
main
points
the
modern
vogue
of
evolution
is
chiefly
owing
to
darwin
s
investigations
as
to
the
origin
of
species
darwin
formed
a
strictly
biological
hypothesis
as
to
the
manner
in
which
certain
forms
of
animal
life
became
established
while
others
died
out
and
disappeared
his
theory
was
that
this
might
be
accounted
for
partly
at
least
in
the
following
way
when
certain
varieties
occurred
the
cause
of
their
occurrence
is
still
in
the
main
unknown
it
might
be
that
some
of
the
points
in
which
they
varied
from
their
parent
species
or
from
other
species
then
existing
made
them
better
able
to
persist
in
the
environment
in
which
they
found
themselves
less
liable
to
be
killed
off
they
might
for
instance
be
better
able
to
endure
the
cold
or
heat
or
changes
of
the
climate
better
able
to
find
nourishment
from
what
surrounded
them
better
able
to
escape
from
or
resist
other
species
which
fed
upon
them
better
fitted
to
attract
or
to
master
the
other
sex
being
thus
less
liable
to
die
their
numbers
relatively
to
other
species
would
increase
and
that
very
increase
in
their
numbers
might
tend
towards
the
extinction
of
those
other
species
this
theory
to
which
darwin
gave
the
name
natural
selection
was
also
called
the
theory
of
survival
of
the
fittest
the
natural
process
which
it
thus
described
was
called
evolution
it
was
very
natural
to
suppose
that
evolution
meant
evolution
from
what
was
lower
into
what
was
higher
in
fact
it
was
observed
that
at
least
one
species
commonly
called
higher
the
species
man
had
so
survived
and
among
men
again
it
was
supposed
that
the
higher
races
ourselves
for
example
had
shewn
a
tendency
to
survive
the
lower
such
as
the
north
american
indians
we
can
kill
them
more
easily
than
they
can
kill
us
the
doctrine
of
evolution
was
then
represented
as
an
explanation
of
how
the
higher
species
survives
the
lower
spencer
for
example
constantly
uses
more
evolved
as
equivalent
to
but
it
is
to
be
noted
that
this
forms
no
part
of
darwin
s
scientific
theory
that
theory
will
explain
equally
well
how
by
an
alteration
in
the
environment
the
gradual
cooling
of
the
earth
for
example
quite
a
different
species
from
man
a
species
which
we
think
infinitely
lower
might
survive
us
the
survival
of
the
fittest
does
mean
as
one
might
suppose
the
survival
of
what
is
fittest
to
fulfil
a
good
purpose
best
adapted
to
a
good
end
at
the
last
it
means
merely
the
survival
of
the
fittest
to
survive
and
the
value
of
the
scientific
theory
and
it
is
a
theory
of
great
value
just
consists
in
shewing
what
are
the
causes
which
produce
certain
biological
effects
whether
these
effects
are
good
or
bad
it
can
not
pretend
to
judge
but
now
let
us
hear
what
mr
spencer
says
about
the
application
of
evolution
to
ethics
i
recur
he
says
to
the
main
proposition
set
forth
in
these
two
chapters
which
has
i
think
been
fully
justified
guided
by
the
truth
that
as
the
conduct
with
which
ethics
deals
is
part
of
conduct
at
large
conduct
at
large
must
be
generally
understood
before
this
part
can
be
specially
understood
and
guided
by
the
further
truth
that
to
understand
conduct
at
large
we
must
understand
the
evolution
of
conduct
we
have
been
led
to
see
that
ethics
has
for
its
that
form
which
universal
conduct
assumes
during
the
last
stages
of
its
evolution
we
have
also
concluded
that
these
last
stages
in
the
evolution
of
conduct
are
those
displayed
by
the
type
of
being
when
he
is
forced
by
increase
of
numbers
to
live
more
and
more
in
presence
of
his
fellows
and
there
has
followed
corollary
that
conduct
gains
ethical
in
proportion
as
the
activities
becoming
less
and
less
militant
and
more
and
more
industrial
are
such
as
do
not
necessitate
mutual
injury
or
hindrance
but
consist
with
and
are
furthered
by
and
mutual
aid
of
chap
ii
the
italics
are
mine
these
implications
of
the
we
shall
now
see
harmonize
with
the
leading
moral
ideas
men
have
otherwise
now
if
we
are
to
take
the
last
sentence
strictly
if
the
propositions
which
precede
it
are
really
thought
by
mr
spencer
to
be
of
the
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
mr
spencer
has
committed
the
naturalistic
fallacy
all
that
the
tells
us
is
that
certain
kinds
of
conduct
are
more
evolved
than
others
and
this
is
in
fact
all
that
mr
spencer
has
attempted
to
prove
in
the
two
chapters
concerned
yet
he
tells
us
that
one
of
the
things
it
has
proved
is
that
gains
ethical
in
proportion
as
it
displays
certain
characteristics
what
he
has
tried
to
prove
is
only
that
in
proportion
as
it
displays
those
characteristics
it
is
it
is
plain
then
that
mr
spencer
the
gaining
of
ethical
sanction
with
the
being
more
evolved
this
follows
strictly
from
his
words
but
mr
spencer
s
language
is
extremely
loose
and
we
shall
presently
see
that
he
seems
to
regard
the
view
it
here
implies
as
false
we
can
not
therefore
take
it
as
mr
spencer
s
definite
view
that
better
means
nothing
but
more
evolved
or
even
that
what
is
more
evolved
is
but
we
are
entitled
to
urge
that
he
is
influenced
by
these
views
and
therefore
by
the
naturalistic
fallacy
it
is
only
by
the
assumption
of
such
influence
that
we
can
explain
his
confusion
as
to
what
he
has
really
proved
and
the
absence
of
any
attempt
to
prove
what
he
says
he
has
proved
that
conduct
which
is
more
evolved
is
better
we
shall
look
in
vain
for
any
attempt
to
shew
that
ethical
sanction
is
in
proportion
to
evolution
or
that
it
is
the
highest
type
of
being
which
displays
the
most
evolved
conduct
yet
mr
spencer
concludes
that
this
is
the
case
it
is
only
fair
to
assume
that
he
is
not
sufficiently
conscious
how
much
these
propositions
stand
in
need
of
proof
what
a
very
different
thing
is
being
more
evolved
from
being
higher
or
it
may
of
course
be
true
that
what
is
more
evolved
is
also
higher
and
better
but
mr
spencer
does
not
seem
aware
that
to
assert
the
one
is
in
any
case
not
the
same
thing
as
to
assert
the
other
he
argues
at
length
that
certain
kinds
of
conduct
are
more
evolved
and
then
informs
us
that
he
has
proved
them
to
gain
ethical
sanction
in
proportion
without
any
warning
that
he
has
omitted
the
most
essential
step
in
such
a
proof
surely
this
is
sufficient
evidence
that
he
does
not
see
how
essential
that
step
is
whatever
be
the
degree
of
mr
spencer
s
own
guilt
what
has
just
been
said
will
serve
to
illustrate
the
kind
of
fallacy
which
is
constantly
committed
by
those
who
profess
to
base
ethics
on
evolution
but
we
must
hasten
to
add
that
the
view
which
mr
spencer
elsewhere
most
emphatically
recommends
is
an
utterly
different
one
it
will
be
useful
briefly
to
deal
with
this
in
order
that
no
injustice
may
be
done
to
mr
spencer
the
discussion
will
be
instructive
partly
from
the
lack
of
clearness
which
mr
spencer
displays
as
to
the
relation
of
this
view
to
the
evolutionistic
one
just
described
and
partly
because
there
is
reason
to
suspect
that
in
this
view
also
he
is
influenced
by
the
naturalistic
fallacy
we
have
seen
that
at
the
end
of
his
second
chapter
mr
spencer
seems
to
announce
that
he
has
already
proved
certain
characteristics
of
conduct
to
be
a
measure
of
its
ethical
value
he
seems
to
think
that
he
has
proved
this
merely
by
considering
the
evolution
of
conduct
and
he
has
certainly
not
given
any
such
proof
unless
we
are
to
understand
that
more
evolved
is
a
mere
synonym
for
ethically
he
now
promises
merely
to
this
certain
conclusion
by
shewing
that
it
harmonizes
with
the
leading
moral
ideas
men
have
otherwise
but
when
we
turn
to
his
third
chapter
we
find
that
what
he
actually
does
is
something
quite
different
he
here
asserts
that
to
establish
the
conclusion
conduct
is
better
in
proportion
as
it
is
more
evolved
an
entirely
new
proof
is
necessary
that
conclusion
will
be
unless
a
certain
proposition
of
which
we
have
heard
nothing
so
far
is
true
unless
it
be
true
that
life
is
on
the
whole
and
the
ethical
proposition
for
which
he
claims
the
support
of
the
leading
moral
ideas
of
mankind
turns
out
to
be
that
life
is
good
or
bad
according
as
it
does
or
does
not
bring
a
surplus
of
agreeable
feeling
here
then
mr
spencer
appears
not
as
an
evolutionist
but
as
a
hedonist
in
ethics
no
conduct
is
better
it
is
more
evolved
degree
of
evolution
can
at
most
be
a
of
ethical
value
and
it
will
only
be
that
if
we
can
prove
the
extremely
difficult
generalisation
that
the
more
evolved
is
always
on
the
whole
the
pleasanter
it
is
plain
that
mr
spencer
here
rejects
the
naturalistic
identification
of
better
with
more
evolved
but
it
is
possible
that
he
is
influenced
by
another
naturalistic
identification
that
of
good
with
it
is
possible
that
mr
spencer
is
a
naturalistic
hedonist
let
us
examine
mr
spencer
s
own
words
he
begins
this
third
chapter
by
an
attempt
to
shew
that
good
the
acts
conducive
to
life
in
self
or
others
and
bad
those
which
directly
or
indirectly
tend
towards
death
special
or
general
and
then
he
asks
is
there
any
assumption
made
in
so
calling
them
yes
he
answers
an
assumption
of
extreme
significance
has
been
made
an
assumption
underlying
all
moral
estimates
the
question
to
be
definitely
raised
and
answered
before
entering
on
any
ethical
discussion
is
the
question
of
late
much
agitated
is
life
worth
living
shall
we
take
the
pessimist
view
or
shall
we
take
the
optimist
view
on
the
answer
to
this
question
depends
every
decision
concerning
the
goodness
or
badness
of
but
mr
spencer
does
not
immediately
proceed
to
give
the
answer
instead
of
this
he
asks
another
question
but
now
have
these
irreconcilable
opinions
pessimist
and
optimist
anything
in
common
and
this
question
he
immediately
answers
by
the
statement
yes
there
is
one
postulate
in
which
pessimists
and
optimists
agree
both
their
arguments
assume
it
to
be
that
life
is
good
or
bad
according
as
it
does
or
does
not
bring
a
surplus
of
agreeable
feeling
it
is
to
the
defence
of
this
statement
that
the
rest
of
the
chapter
is
devoted
and
at
the
end
mr
spencer
formulates
his
conclusion
in
the
following
words
no
school
can
avoid
taking
for
the
ultimate
moral
aim
a
desirable
state
of
feeling
called
by
whatever
name
gratification
enjoyment
happiness
pleasure
somewhere
at
some
time
to
some
being
or
beings
is
an
inexpugnable
element
of
the
conception
now
in
all
this
there
are
two
points
to
which
i
wish
to
call
attention
the
first
is
that
mr
spencer
does
not
after
all
tell
us
clearly
what
he
takes
to
be
the
relation
of
pleasure
and
evolution
in
ethical
theory
obviously
he
should
mean
that
pleasure
is
the
intrinsically
desirable
thing
that
other
good
things
are
good
only
in
the
sense
that
they
are
means
to
its
existence
nothing
but
this
can
properly
be
meant
by
asserting
it
to
be
ultimate
moral
aim
or
as
he
subsequently
says
ultimately
supreme
and
if
this
were
so
it
would
follow
that
the
more
evolved
conduct
was
better
than
the
less
evolved
only
because
and
in
proportion
as
it
gave
more
pleasure
but
mr
spencer
tells
us
that
two
conditions
are
taken
together
to
prove
the
more
evolved
conduct
better
that
it
should
tend
to
produce
more
life
that
life
should
be
worth
living
or
contain
a
balance
of
pleasure
and
the
point
i
wish
to
emphasise
is
that
if
these
conditions
are
sufficient
then
pleasure
can
not
be
the
sole
good
for
though
to
produce
more
life
is
if
the
second
of
mr
spencer
s
propositions
be
correct
of
producing
more
pleasure
it
is
not
the
only
way
it
is
quite
possible
that
a
small
quantity
of
life
which
was
more
intensely
and
uniformly
present
should
give
a
greater
quantity
of
pleasure
than
the
greatest
possible
quantity
of
life
that
was
only
just
worth
and
in
that
case
on
the
hedonistic
supposition
that
pleasure
is
the
only
thing
worth
having
we
should
have
to
prefer
the
smaller
quantity
of
life
and
therefore
according
to
mr
spencer
the
less
evolved
conduct
accordingly
if
mr
spencer
is
a
true
hedonist
the
fact
that
life
gives
a
balance
of
pleasure
is
as
he
seems
to
think
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
more
evolved
conduct
is
the
better
if
mr
spencer
means
us
to
understand
that
it
sufficient
then
his
view
about
pleasure
can
only
be
not
that
it
is
the
sole
good
or
ultimately
supreme
end
but
that
a
balance
of
it
is
a
necessary
constituent
of
the
supreme
end
in
short
mr
spencer
seems
to
maintain
that
more
life
is
decidedly
better
than
less
it
give
a
balance
of
pleasure
and
that
contention
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
pleasure
is
ultimate
moral
mr
spencer
implies
that
of
two
quantities
of
life
which
gave
an
equal
amount
of
pleasure
the
larger
would
nevertheless
be
preferable
to
the
less
and
if
this
be
so
then
he
must
maintain
that
quantity
of
life
or
degree
of
evolution
is
itself
an
ultimate
condition
of
value
he
leaves
us
therefore
in
doubt
whether
he
is
not
still
retaining
the
evolutionistic
proposition
that
the
more
evolved
is
better
simply
because
it
is
more
evolved
alongside
of
the
hedonistic
proposition
that
the
more
pleasant
is
better
simply
because
it
is
more
pleasant
but
the
second
question
which
we
have
to
ask
is
what
reasons
has
mr
spencer
for
assigning
to
pleasure
the
position
which
he
does
assign
to
it
he
tells
us
we
saw
that
the
arguments
both
of
pessimists
and
of
optimists
assume
it
to
be
that
life
is
good
or
bad
according
as
it
does
or
does
not
bring
a
surplus
of
agreeable
feeling
and
he
betters
this
later
by
telling
us
that
since
avowed
or
implied
pessimists
and
optimists
of
one
or
other
shade
taken
together
constitute
all
men
it
results
that
this
postulate
is
universally
accepted
that
these
statements
are
absolutely
false
is
of
course
quite
obvious
but
why
does
mr
spencer
think
them
true
and
what
is
more
important
a
question
which
mr
spencer
does
not
distinguish
too
clearly
from
the
last
why
does
he
think
the
postulate
itself
to
be
true
mr
spencer
himself
tells
us
his
proof
is
that
reversing
the
application
of
the
words
good
and
bad
applying
the
word
good
to
conduct
the
aggregate
results
of
which
are
painful
and
the
word
bad
to
conduct
of
which
the
aggregate
results
are
pleasurable
creates
absurdities
he
does
not
say
whether
this
is
because
it
is
absurd
to
think
that
the
quality
which
we
by
the
good
really
applies
to
what
is
painful
even
however
if
we
assume
him
to
mean
this
and
if
we
assume
that
absurdities
are
thus
created
it
is
plain
he
would
only
prove
that
what
is
painful
is
properly
thought
to
be
bad
and
what
is
pleasant
to
be
good
it
would
not
prove
at
all
that
pleasure
is
supreme
there
is
however
reason
to
think
that
part
of
what
mr
spencer
means
is
the
naturalistic
fallacy
that
he
imagines
pleasant
or
productive
of
pleasure
is
the
very
meaning
of
the
word
good
and
that
the
absurdity
is
due
to
this
it
is
at
all
events
certain
that
he
does
not
distinguish
this
possible
meaning
from
that
which
would
admit
that
good
denotes
an
unique
indefinable
quality
the
doctrine
of
naturalistic
hedonism
is
indeed
quite
strictly
implied
in
his
statement
that
virtue
can
not
otherwise
than
in
terms
of
happiness
and
though
as
i
remarked
above
we
can
not
insist
upon
mr
spencer
s
words
as
a
certain
clue
to
any
definite
meaning
that
is
only
because
he
generally
expresses
by
them
several
inconsistent
alternatives
the
naturalistic
fallacy
being
in
this
case
one
such
alternative
it
is
certainly
impossible
to
find
any
further
reasons
given
by
mr
spencer
for
his
conviction
that
pleasure
both
is
the
supreme
end
and
is
universally
admitted
to
be
so
he
seems
to
assume
throughout
that
we
mean
by
good
conduct
what
is
productive
of
pleasure
and
by
bad
what
is
productive
of
pain
so
far
then
as
he
is
a
hedonist
he
would
seem
to
be
a
naturalistic
hedonist
so
much
for
mr
spencer
it
is
of
course
quite
possible
that
his
treatment
of
ethics
contains
many
interesting
and
instructive
remarks
it
would
seem
indeed
that
mr
spencer
s
main
view
that
of
which
he
is
most
clearly
and
most
often
conscious
is
that
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
and
that
to
consider
the
direction
of
evolution
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
way
in
which
we
shall
get
most
of
it
and
this
theory
he
could
establish
that
amount
of
pleasure
is
always
in
direct
proportion
to
amount
of
evolution
that
it
was
plain
what
conduct
was
more
evolved
be
a
very
valuable
contribution
to
the
science
of
sociology
it
would
even
if
pleasure
were
the
sole
good
be
a
valuable
contribution
to
ethics
but
the
above
discussion
should
have
made
it
plain
that
if
what
we
want
from
an
ethical
philosopher
is
a
scientific
and
systematic
ethics
not
merely
an
ethics
professedly
based
on
science
if
what
we
want
is
a
clear
discussion
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
ethics
and
a
statement
of
the
ultimate
reasons
why
one
way
of
acting
should
be
considered
better
than
another
then
mr
spencer
s
data
of
ethics
is
immeasurably
far
from
satisfying
these
demands
it
remains
only
to
state
clearly
what
is
definitely
fallacious
in
prevalent
views
as
to
the
relation
of
evolution
to
ethics
in
those
views
with
regard
to
which
it
seems
so
uncertain
how
far
mr
spencer
intends
to
encourage
them
i
proposed
to
confine
the
term
evolutionistic
ethics
to
the
view
that
we
need
only
to
consider
the
tendency
of
evolution
in
order
to
discover
the
direction
in
which
we
to
go
this
view
must
be
carefully
distinguished
from
certain
others
which
may
be
commonly
confused
with
it
it
might
for
instance
be
held
that
the
direction
in
which
living
things
have
hitherto
developed
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
direction
of
progress
it
might
be
held
that
the
more
evolved
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
also
better
and
in
such
a
view
no
fallacy
is
involved
but
if
it
is
to
give
us
any
guidance
as
to
how
we
ought
to
act
in
the
future
it
does
involve
a
long
and
painful
investigation
of
the
exact
points
in
which
the
superiority
of
the
more
evolved
consists
we
can
not
assume
that
because
evolution
is
progress
the
therefore
every
point
in
which
the
more
evolved
differs
from
the
less
is
a
point
in
which
it
is
better
than
the
less
a
simple
consideration
of
the
course
of
evolution
will
therefore
on
this
view
by
no
means
suffice
to
inform
us
of
the
course
we
ought
to
pursue
we
shall
have
to
employ
all
the
resources
of
a
strictly
ethical
discussion
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
correct
valuation
of
the
different
results
of
evolution
to
distinguish
the
more
valuable
from
the
less
valuable
and
both
from
those
which
are
no
better
than
their
causes
or
perhaps
even
worse
in
fact
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
on
this
view
if
all
that
be
meant
is
that
evolution
has
the
been
a
progress
the
theory
of
evolution
can
give
any
assistance
to
ethics
at
all
the
judgment
that
evolution
has
been
a
progress
is
itself
an
independent
ethical
judgment
and
even
if
we
take
it
to
be
more
certain
and
obvious
than
any
of
the
detailed
judgments
upon
which
it
must
logically
depend
for
confirmation
we
certainly
can
not
use
it
as
a
datum
from
which
to
infer
details
it
is
at
all
events
certain
that
if
this
had
been
the
relation
held
to
exist
between
evolution
and
ethics
no
such
importance
would
have
been
attached
to
the
bearing
of
evolution
on
ethics
as
we
actually
find
claimed
for
it
the
view
which
as
i
have
said
seems
to
be
mr
spencer
s
main
view
may
also
be
held
without
fallacy
it
may
be
held
that
the
more
evolved
though
not
itself
the
better
is
a
because
a
concomitant
of
the
better
but
this
view
also
obviously
involves
an
exhaustive
preliminary
discussion
of
the
fundamental
ethical
question
what
after
all
is
better
that
mr
spencer
entirely
dispenses
with
such
a
discussion
in
support
of
his
contention
that
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
i
have
pointed
out
and
that
if
we
attempt
such
a
discussion
we
shall
arrive
at
no
such
simple
result
i
shall
presently
try
to
shew
if
however
the
good
is
not
simple
it
is
by
no
means
likely
that
we
shall
be
able
to
discover
evolution
to
be
a
criterion
of
it
we
shall
have
to
establish
a
relation
between
two
highly
complicated
sets
of
data
and
moreover
if
we
had
once
settled
what
were
goods
and
what
their
comparative
values
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
we
should
need
to
call
in
the
aid
of
evolution
as
a
criterion
of
how
to
get
the
most
it
is
plain
then
again
that
if
this
were
the
only
relation
imagined
to
exist
between
evolution
and
ethics
it
could
hardly
have
been
thought
to
justify
the
assignment
of
any
importance
in
ethics
to
the
theory
of
evolution
finally
it
may
be
held
that
though
evolution
gives
us
no
help
in
discovering
what
results
of
our
efforts
will
be
best
it
does
give
some
help
in
discovering
what
it
is
to
attain
and
what
are
the
means
to
its
attainment
that
the
theory
really
may
be
of
service
to
ethics
in
this
way
can
not
be
denied
but
it
is
certainly
not
common
to
find
this
humble
ancillary
bearing
clearly
and
exclusively
assigned
to
it
in
the
mere
fact
then
that
these
views
of
the
relation
of
evolution
to
ethics
would
give
so
very
little
importance
to
that
relation
we
have
evidence
that
what
is
typical
in
the
coupling
of
the
two
names
is
the
fallacious
view
to
which
i
propose
to
restrict
the
name
evolutionistic
this
is
the
view
that
we
ought
to
move
in
the
direction
of
evolution
simply
it
is
the
direction
of
evolution
that
the
forces
of
nature
are
working
on
that
side
is
taken
as
a
presumption
that
it
is
the
right
side
that
such
a
view
apart
from
metaphysical
presuppositions
with
which
i
shall
presently
deal
is
simply
fallacious
i
have
tried
to
shew
it
can
only
rest
on
a
confused
belief
that
somehow
the
good
simply
the
side
on
which
nature
is
working
and
it
thus
involves
another
confused
belief
which
is
very
marked
in
mr
spencer
s
whole
treatment
of
evolution
for
after
all
is
evolution
the
side
on
which
nature
is
working
in
the
sense
which
mr
spencer
gives
to
the
term
and
in
any
sense
in
which
it
can
be
regarded
as
a
fact
that
the
more
evolved
is
higher
evolution
denotes
only
a
historical
process
that
things
will
permanently
continue
to
evolve
in
the
future
or
that
they
have
always
evolved
in
the
past
we
have
not
the
smallest
reason
to
believe
for
evolution
does
not
in
this
sense
denote
a
natural
like
the
law
of
gravity
darwin
s
theory
of
natural
selection
does
indeed
state
a
natural
law
it
states
that
given
certain
conditions
certain
results
will
always
happen
but
evolution
as
mr
spencer
understands
it
and
as
it
is
commonly
understood
denotes
something
very
different
it
denotes
only
a
process
which
has
actually
occurred
at
a
given
time
because
the
conditions
at
the
beginning
of
that
time
happened
to
be
of
a
certain
nature
that
such
conditions
will
always
be
given
or
have
always
been
given
can
not
be
assumed
and
it
is
only
the
process
which
according
to
natural
law
must
follow
from
conditions
and
no
others
that
appears
to
be
also
on
the
whole
a
progress
precisely
the
same
natural
laws
darwin
s
for
instance
would
under
other
conditions
render
inevitable
not
evolution
not
a
development
from
lower
to
higher
but
the
converse
process
which
has
been
called
involution
yet
mr
spencer
constantly
speaks
of
the
process
which
is
exemplified
in
the
development
of
man
as
if
it
had
all
the
augustness
of
a
universal
law
of
nature
whereas
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
it
other
than
a
temporary
accident
requiring
not
only
certain
universal
natural
laws
but
also
the
existence
of
a
certain
state
of
things
at
a
certain
time
the
only
concerned
in
the
matter
are
certainly
such
as
under
other
circumstances
would
allow
us
to
infer
not
the
development
but
the
extinction
of
man
and
that
circumstances
will
always
be
favourable
to
further
development
that
nature
will
always
work
on
the
side
of
evolution
we
have
no
reason
whatever
to
believe
thus
the
idea
that
evolution
throws
important
light
on
ethics
seems
to
be
due
to
a
double
confusion
our
respect
for
the
process
is
enlisted
by
the
representation
of
it
as
the
law
of
nature
but
on
the
other
hand
our
respect
for
laws
of
nature
would
be
speedily
diminished
did
we
not
imagine
that
this
desirable
process
was
one
of
them
to
suppose
that
a
law
of
nature
is
respectable
is
to
commit
the
naturalistic
fallacy
but
no
one
probably
would
be
tempted
to
commit
it
unless
something
which
respectable
were
represented
as
a
law
of
nature
if
it
were
clearly
recognised
that
there
is
no
evidence
for
supposing
nature
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
good
there
would
probably
be
less
tendency
to
hold
the
opinion
which
on
other
grounds
is
demonstrably
false
that
no
such
evidence
is
required
and
if
both
false
opinions
were
clearly
seen
to
be
false
it
would
be
plain
that
evolution
has
very
little
indeed
to
say
to
ethics
in
this
chapter
i
have
begun
the
criticism
of
certain
ethical
views
which
seem
to
owe
their
influence
mainly
to
the
naturalistic
fallacy
the
fallacy
which
consists
in
identifying
the
simple
notion
which
we
mean
by
good
with
some
other
notion
they
are
views
which
profess
to
tell
us
what
is
good
in
itself
and
my
criticism
of
them
is
mainly
directed
to
bring
out
the
negative
result
that
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
which
they
declare
to
be
the
sole
good
really
to
be
so
to
illustrate
further
the
positive
result
already
established
in
chapter
i
that
the
fundamental
principles
of
ethics
must
be
propositions
declaring
what
things
and
in
what
degree
possess
a
simple
and
unanalysable
property
which
may
be
called
intrinsic
value
or
the
chapter
began
by
dividing
the
views
to
be
criticised
into
those
which
supposing
good
to
be
defined
by
reference
to
some
supersensible
reality
conclude
that
the
sole
good
is
to
be
found
in
such
a
reality
and
may
therefore
be
called
metaphysical
those
which
assign
a
similar
position
to
some
natural
object
and
may
therefore
be
called
of
naturalistic
views
that
which
regards
pleasure
as
the
sole
good
has
received
far
the
fullest
and
most
serious
treatment
and
was
therefore
reserved
for
chapter
iii
all
other
forms
of
naturalism
may
be
first
dismissed
by
taking
typical
examples
as
typical
of
naturalistic
views
other
than
hedonism
there
was
first
taken
the
popular
commendation
of
what
is
natural
it
was
pointed
out
that
by
natural
there
might
here
be
meant
either
normal
or
necessary
and
that
neither
the
normal
nor
the
necessary
could
be
seriously
supposed
to
be
either
always
good
or
the
only
good
things
but
a
more
important
type
because
one
which
claims
to
be
capable
of
system
is
to
be
found
in
evolutionistic
the
influence
of
the
fallacious
opinion
that
to
be
better
to
be
more
evolved
was
illustrated
by
an
examination
of
mr
herbert
spencer
s
ethics
and
it
was
pointed
out
that
but
for
the
influence
of
this
opinion
evolution
could
hardly
have
been
supposed
to
have
any
important
bearing
upon
ethics
chapter
iii
hedonism
in
this
chapter
we
have
to
deal
with
what
is
perhaps
the
most
famous
and
the
most
widely
held
of
all
ethical
principles
the
principle
that
nothing
is
good
but
pleasure
my
chief
reason
for
treating
of
this
principle
in
this
place
is
as
i
said
that
hedonism
appears
in
the
main
to
be
a
form
of
naturalistic
ethics
in
other
words
that
pleasure
has
been
so
generally
held
to
be
the
sole
good
is
almost
entirely
due
to
the
fact
that
it
has
seemed
to
be
somehow
involved
in
the
of
good
to
be
pointed
out
by
the
very
meaning
of
the
word
if
this
is
so
then
the
prevalence
of
hedonism
has
been
mainly
due
to
what
i
have
called
the
naturalistic
fallacy
the
failure
to
distinguish
clearly
that
unique
and
indefinable
quality
which
we
mean
by
good
and
that
it
is
so
we
have
very
strong
evidence
in
the
fact
that
of
all
hedonistic
writers
sidgwick
alone
has
clearly
recognised
that
by
good
we
do
mean
something
unanalysable
and
has
alone
been
led
thereby
to
emphasise
the
fact
that
if
hedonism
be
true
its
claims
to
be
so
must
be
rested
solely
on
its
that
we
must
maintain
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
to
be
a
mere
it
appeared
to
sidgwick
as
a
new
discovery
that
what
he
calls
the
method
of
intuitionism
must
be
retained
as
valid
alongside
of
and
indeed
as
the
foundation
of
what
he
calls
the
alternative
methods
of
utilitarianism
and
egoism
and
that
it
was
a
new
discovery
can
hardly
be
doubted
in
previous
hedonists
we
find
no
clear
and
consistent
recognition
of
the
fact
that
their
fundamental
proposition
involves
the
assumption
that
a
certain
unique
predicate
can
be
directly
seen
to
belong
to
pleasure
alone
among
existents
they
do
not
emphasise
as
they
could
hardly
have
failed
to
have
done
had
they
perceived
it
how
utterly
independent
of
all
other
truths
this
truth
must
be
moreover
it
is
easy
to
see
how
this
unique
position
should
have
been
assigned
to
pleasure
without
any
clear
consciousness
of
the
assumption
involved
hedonism
is
for
a
sufficiently
obvious
reason
the
first
conclusion
at
which
any
one
who
begins
to
reflect
upon
ethics
naturally
arrives
it
is
very
easy
to
notice
the
fact
that
we
are
pleased
with
things
the
things
we
enjoy
and
the
things
we
do
not
form
two
unmistakable
classes
to
which
our
attention
is
constantly
directed
but
it
is
comparatively
difficult
to
distinguish
the
fact
that
we
a
thing
from
the
fact
that
we
are
pleased
with
it
although
if
we
look
at
the
two
states
of
mind
we
must
see
that
they
are
different
even
though
they
generally
go
together
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
in
they
are
different
or
that
the
difference
can
in
any
connection
be
of
more
importance
than
the
many
other
differences
which
are
so
patent
and
yet
so
difficult
to
analyse
between
one
of
enjoyment
and
another
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
that
by
approving
of
a
thing
we
mean
that
it
has
a
certain
the
predicate
namely
which
defines
the
peculiar
sphere
of
ethics
whereas
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
thing
no
such
unique
object
of
thought
is
involved
nothing
is
more
natural
than
the
vulgar
mistake
which
we
find
expressed
in
a
recent
book
on
ethics
the
primary
ethical
fact
is
we
have
said
that
something
is
approved
or
disapproved
that
is
in
other
words
the
ideal
representation
of
certain
events
in
the
way
of
sensation
perception
or
idea
is
attended
with
a
feeling
of
pleasure
or
of
in
ordinary
speech
i
want
this
i
like
this
i
care
about
this
are
constantly
used
as
equivalents
for
i
think
this
and
in
this
way
it
is
very
natural
to
be
led
to
suppose
that
there
is
no
distinct
class
of
ethical
judgments
but
only
the
class
things
enjoyed
in
spite
of
the
fact
which
is
very
clear
if
not
very
common
that
we
do
not
always
approve
what
we
enjoy
it
is
of
course
very
obvious
that
from
the
supposition
that
i
think
this
good
is
identical
with
i
am
pleased
with
this
it
can
not
be
inferred
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
what
could
be
logically
inferred
from
such
a
supposition
and
it
seems
enough
that
such
an
inference
should
suggest
itself
a
very
little
examination
of
what
is
commonly
written
on
the
subject
will
suffice
to
shew
that
a
logical
confusion
of
this
nature
is
very
common
moreover
the
very
commission
of
the
naturalistic
fallacy
involves
that
those
who
commit
it
should
not
recognise
clearly
the
meaning
of
the
proposition
this
is
good
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
distinguish
this
from
other
propositions
which
seem
to
resemble
it
and
where
this
is
so
it
is
of
course
impossible
that
its
logical
relations
should
be
clearly
perceived
taylor
s
of
there
is
therefore
ample
reason
to
suppose
that
hedonism
is
in
general
a
form
of
naturalism
that
its
acceptance
is
generally
due
to
the
naturalistic
fallacy
it
is
indeed
only
when
we
have
detected
this
fallacy
when
we
have
become
clearly
aware
of
the
unique
object
which
is
meant
by
good
that
we
are
able
to
give
to
hedonism
the
precise
definition
used
above
nothing
is
good
but
pleasure
and
it
may
therefore
be
objected
that
in
attacking
this
doctrine
under
the
name
of
hedonism
i
am
attacking
a
doctrine
which
has
never
really
been
held
but
it
is
very
common
to
hold
a
doctrine
without
being
clearly
aware
what
it
is
you
hold
and
though
when
hedonists
argue
in
favour
of
what
they
call
hedonism
i
admit
that
in
order
to
suppose
their
arguments
valid
they
must
have
before
their
minds
something
than
the
doctrine
i
have
defined
yet
in
order
to
draw
the
conclusions
that
they
draw
it
is
necessary
that
they
should
have
before
their
minds
this
doctrine
in
fact
my
justification
for
supposing
that
i
shall
have
refuted
hedonism
if
i
refute
the
proposition
nothing
is
good
but
pleasure
is
that
although
hedonists
have
rarely
stated
their
principle
in
this
form
and
though
its
truth
in
this
form
will
certainly
not
follow
from
their
arguments
yet
their
ethical
will
follow
logically
from
nothing
else
any
pretence
of
the
hedonistic
method
to
discover
to
us
practical
truths
which
we
should
not
otherwise
have
known
is
founded
on
the
principle
that
the
course
of
action
which
will
bring
the
greatest
balance
of
pleasure
is
certainly
the
right
one
and
failing
an
absolute
proof
that
the
greatest
balance
of
pleasure
coincides
with
the
greatest
balance
of
other
goods
which
it
is
not
generally
attempted
to
give
this
principle
can
only
be
justified
if
pleasure
be
the
sole
good
indeed
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
hedonists
are
distinguished
by
arguing
in
disputed
practical
questions
pleasure
were
the
sole
good
and
that
it
is
justifiable
for
this
among
other
reasons
to
take
this
as
ethical
principle
of
hedonism
will
i
hope
be
made
further
evident
by
the
whole
discussion
of
this
chapter
by
hedonism
then
i
mean
the
doctrine
that
pleasure
is
good
as
an
end
good
in
the
sense
which
i
have
tried
to
point
out
as
indefinable
the
doctrine
that
pleasure
other
is
good
as
an
end
is
not
hedonism
and
i
shall
not
dispute
its
truth
nor
again
is
the
doctrine
that
other
things
beside
pleasure
are
good
as
means
at
all
inconsistent
with
hedonism
the
hedonist
is
not
bound
to
maintain
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
if
under
good
he
includes
as
we
generally
do
what
is
good
as
means
to
an
end
well
the
end
itself
in
attacking
hedonism
i
am
therefore
simply
and
solely
attacking
the
doctrine
that
pleasure
is
good
as
an
end
or
in
itself
i
am
not
attacking
the
doctrine
that
pleasure
good
as
an
end
or
in
itself
nor
am
i
attacking
any
doctrine
whatever
as
to
what
are
the
best
means
we
can
take
in
order
to
obtain
pleasure
or
any
other
end
hedonists
do
in
general
recommend
a
course
of
conduct
which
is
very
similar
to
that
which
i
should
recommend
i
do
not
quarrel
with
them
about
most
of
their
practical
conclusions
i
quarrel
only
with
the
reasons
by
which
they
seem
to
think
their
conclusions
can
be
supported
and
i
do
emphatically
deny
that
the
correctness
of
their
conclusions
is
any
ground
for
inferring
the
correctness
of
their
principles
a
correct
conclusion
may
always
be
obtained
by
fallacious
reasoning
and
the
good
life
or
virtuous
maxims
of
a
hedonist
afford
absolutely
no
presumption
that
his
ethical
philosophy
is
also
good
it
is
his
ethical
philosophy
alone
with
which
i
am
concerned
what
i
dispute
is
the
excellence
of
his
reasoning
not
the
excellence
of
his
character
as
a
man
or
even
as
moral
teacher
it
may
be
thought
that
my
contention
is
unimportant
but
that
is
no
ground
for
thinking
that
i
am
not
in
the
right
what
i
am
concerned
with
is
knowledge
only
that
we
should
think
correctly
and
so
far
arrive
at
some
truth
however
unimportant
i
do
not
say
that
such
knowledge
will
make
us
more
useful
members
of
society
if
any
one
does
not
care
for
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
then
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
only
it
should
not
be
thought
that
a
lack
of
interest
in
what
i
have
to
say
is
any
ground
for
holding
it
untrue
hedonists
then
hold
that
all
other
things
but
pleasure
whether
conduct
or
virtue
or
knowledge
whether
life
or
nature
or
beauty
are
only
good
as
means
to
pleasure
or
for
the
sake
of
pleasure
never
for
their
own
sakes
or
as
ends
in
themselves
this
view
was
held
by
aristippus
the
disciple
of
socrates
and
by
the
cyrenaic
school
which
he
founded
it
is
associated
with
epicurus
and
the
epicureans
and
it
has
been
held
in
modern
times
chiefly
by
those
philosophers
who
call
themselves
utilitarians
by
bentham
and
by
mill
for
instance
herbert
spencer
as
we
have
seen
also
says
he
holds
it
and
professor
sidgwick
as
we
shall
see
holds
it
too
yet
all
these
philosophers
as
has
been
said
differ
from
one
another
more
or
less
both
as
to
what
they
mean
by
hedonism
and
as
to
the
reasons
for
which
it
is
to
be
accepted
as
a
true
doctrine
the
matter
is
therefore
obviously
not
quite
so
simple
as
it
might
at
first
appear
my
own
object
will
be
to
shew
quite
clearly
what
the
theory
must
imply
if
it
is
made
precise
if
all
confusions
and
inconsistencies
are
removed
from
the
conception
of
it
and
when
this
is
done
i
think
it
will
appear
that
all
the
various
reasons
given
for
holding
it
to
be
true
are
really
quite
inadequate
that
they
are
not
reasons
for
holding
hedonism
but
only
for
holding
some
other
doctrine
which
is
confused
therewith
in
order
to
attain
this
object
i
propose
to
take
first
mill
s
doctrine
as
set
forth
in
his
book
called
we
shall
find
in
mill
a
conception
of
hedonism
and
arguments
in
its
favour
which
fairly
represent
those
of
a
large
class
of
hedonistic
writers
to
these
representative
conceptions
and
arguments
grave
objections
objections
which
appear
to
me
to
be
conclusive
have
been
urged
by
professor
sidgwick
these
i
shall
try
to
give
in
my
own
words
and
shall
then
proceed
to
consider
and
refute
professor
sidgwick
s
own
much
more
precise
conceptions
and
arguments
with
this
i
think
we
shall
have
traversed
the
whole
field
of
hedonistic
doctrine
it
will
appear
from
the
discussion
that
the
task
of
deciding
what
is
or
is
not
good
in
itself
is
by
no
means
an
easy
one
and
in
this
way
the
discussion
will
afford
a
good
example
of
the
method
which
it
is
necessary
to
pursue
in
attempting
to
arrive
at
the
truth
with
regard
to
this
primary
class
of
ethical
principles
in
particular
it
will
appear
that
two
principles
of
method
must
be
constantly
kept
in
mind
that
the
naturalistic
fallacy
must
not
be
committed
that
the
distinction
between
means
and
ends
must
be
observed
i
propose
then
to
begin
by
an
examination
of
mill
s
that
is
a
book
which
contains
an
admirably
clear
and
fair
discussion
of
many
ethical
principles
and
methods
mill
exposes
not
a
few
simple
mistakes
which
are
very
likely
to
be
made
by
those
who
approach
ethical
problems
without
much
previous
reflection
but
what
i
am
concerned
with
is
the
mistakes
which
mill
himself
appears
to
have
made
and
these
only
so
far
as
they
concern
the
hedonistic
principle
let
me
repeat
what
that
principle
is
it
is
i
said
that
pleasure
is
the
only
thing
at
which
we
ought
to
aim
the
only
thing
that
is
good
as
an
end
and
for
its
own
sake
and
now
let
us
turn
to
mill
and
see
whether
he
accepts
this
description
of
the
question
at
issue
pleasure
he
says
at
the
outset
and
freedom
from
pain
are
the
only
things
desirable
as
ends
and
again
at
the
end
of
his
argument
to
think
of
an
object
as
desirable
unless
for
the
sake
of
its
consequences
and
to
think
of
it
as
pleasant
are
one
and
the
same
thing
these
statements
taken
together
and
apart
from
certain
confusions
which
are
obvious
in
them
seem
to
imply
the
principle
i
have
stated
and
if
i
succeed
in
shewing
that
mill
s
reasons
for
them
do
not
prove
them
it
must
at
least
be
admitted
that
i
have
not
been
fighting
with
shadows
or
demolishing
a
man
of
straw
my
references
are
to
the
edition
it
will
be
observed
that
mill
adds
absence
of
pain
to
pleasure
in
his
first
statement
though
not
in
his
second
there
is
in
this
a
confusion
with
which
however
we
need
not
deal
i
shall
talk
of
pleasure
alone
for
the
sake
of
conciseness
but
all
my
arguments
will
apply
to
absence
of
pain
it
is
easy
to
make
the
necessary
substitutions
mill
holds
then
that
happiness
is
desirable
and
only
thing
as
an
end
all
other
things
being
only
desirable
as
means
to
that
end
happiness
he
has
already
defined
as
pleasure
and
the
absence
of
pain
he
does
not
pretend
that
this
is
more
than
an
arbitrary
verbal
definition
and
as
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
it
his
principle
then
is
pleasure
is
the
only
thing
desirable
if
i
may
be
allowed
when
i
say
pleasure
to
include
in
that
word
so
far
as
necessary
absence
of
pain
and
now
what
are
his
reasons
for
holding
that
principle
to
be
true
he
has
already
told
us
that
questions
of
ultimate
ends
are
not
amenable
to
direct
proof
whatever
can
be
proved
to
be
good
must
be
so
by
being
shewn
to
be
a
means
to
something
to
be
good
without
with
this
i
perfectly
agree
indeed
the
chief
object
of
my
first
chapter
was
to
shew
that
this
is
so
anything
which
is
good
as
an
end
must
be
admitted
to
be
good
without
proof
we
are
agreed
so
far
mill
even
uses
the
same
examples
which
i
used
in
my
second
chapter
how
he
says
is
it
possible
to
prove
that
health
is
good
what
proof
is
it
possible
to
give
that
pleasure
is
good
well
in
chapter
iv
in
which
he
deals
with
the
proof
of
his
utilitarian
principle
mill
repeats
the
above
statement
in
these
words
it
has
already
he
says
been
remarked
that
questions
of
ultimate
ends
do
not
admit
of
proof
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
term
questions
about
ends
he
goes
on
in
this
same
passage
are
in
other
words
questions
what
things
are
i
am
quoting
these
repetitions
because
they
make
it
plain
what
otherwise
might
have
been
doubted
that
mill
is
using
the
words
desirable
or
desirable
as
an
end
as
absolutely
and
precisely
equivalent
to
the
words
good
as
an
we
are
then
now
to
hear
what
reasons
he
advances
for
this
doctrine
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
as
an
end
my
italics
questions
about
ends
he
says
pp
are
in
other
words
questions
what
things
are
desirable
the
utilitarian
doctrine
is
that
happiness
is
desirable
and
the
only
thing
desirable
as
an
end
all
other
things
being
only
desirable
as
means
to
that
end
what
ought
to
be
required
of
this
doctrine
what
conditions
is
it
requisite
that
the
doctrine
should
fulfil
to
make
good
its
claim
to
be
believed
the
only
proof
capable
of
being
given
that
a
thing
is
visible
is
that
people
actually
see
it
the
only
proof
that
a
sound
is
audible
is
that
people
hear
it
and
so
of
the
other
sources
of
our
experience
in
like
manner
i
apprehend
the
sole
evidence
it
is
possible
to
produce
that
anything
is
desirable
is
that
people
do
actually
desire
it
if
the
end
which
the
utilitarian
doctrine
proposes
to
itself
were
not
in
theory
and
in
practice
acknowledged
to
be
an
end
nothing
could
ever
convince
any
person
that
it
was
so
no
reason
can
be
given
why
the
general
happiness
is
desirable
except
that
each
person
so
far
as
he
believes
it
to
be
attainable
desires
his
own
happiness
this
however
being
the
fact
we
have
not
only
all
the
proof
which
the
case
admits
of
but
all
which
it
is
possible
to
require
that
happiness
is
a
good
that
each
person
s
happiness
is
a
good
to
that
person
and
the
general
happiness
therefore
a
good
to
the
aggregate
of
all
persons
happiness
has
made
out
its
title
as
of
the
ends
of
conduct
and
consequently
one
of
the
criteria
of
there
that
is
enough
that
is
my
first
point
mill
has
made
as
naïve
and
artless
a
use
of
the
naturalistic
fallacy
as
anybody
could
desire
good
he
tells
us
means
desirable
and
you
can
only
find
out
what
is
desirable
by
seeking
to
find
out
what
is
actually
desired
this
is
of
course
only
one
step
towards
the
proof
of
hedonism
for
it
may
be
as
mill
goes
on
to
say
that
other
things
beside
pleasure
are
desired
whether
or
not
pleasure
is
the
only
thing
desired
is
as
mill
himself
admits
a
psychological
question
to
which
we
shall
presently
proceed
the
important
step
for
ethics
is
this
one
just
taken
the
step
which
pretends
to
prove
that
good
means
well
the
fallacy
in
this
step
is
so
obvious
that
it
is
quite
wonderful
how
mill
failed
to
see
it
the
fact
is
that
desirable
does
not
mean
able
to
be
desired
as
visible
means
able
to
be
the
desirable
means
simply
what
to
be
desired
or
to
be
desired
just
as
the
detestable
means
not
what
can
be
but
what
ought
to
be
detested
and
the
damnable
what
deserves
to
be
damned
mill
has
then
smuggled
in
under
cover
of
the
word
desirable
the
very
notion
about
which
he
ought
to
be
quite
clear
desirable
does
indeed
mean
what
it
is
good
to
desire
but
when
this
is
understood
it
is
no
longer
plausible
to
say
that
our
only
test
of
is
what
is
actually
desired
is
it
merely
a
tautology
when
the
prayer
book
talks
of
desires
are
not
desires
also
possible
nay
we
find
mill
himself
talking
of
a
better
and
nobler
object
of
desire
as
if
after
all
what
is
desired
were
not
good
and
good
in
proportion
to
the
amount
it
is
desired
moreover
if
the
desired
is
the
good
then
the
good
is
the
motive
of
our
actions
and
there
can
be
no
question
of
finding
motives
for
doing
it
as
mill
is
at
such
pains
to
do
if
mill
s
explanation
of
desirable
be
then
his
statement
that
the
rule
of
action
may
be
with
the
motive
of
it
is
untrue
for
the
motive
of
action
will
then
be
according
to
him
its
rule
there
can
be
no
distinction
between
the
two
and
therefore
no
confusion
and
thus
he
has
contradicted
himself
flatly
these
are
specimens
of
the
contradictions
which
as
i
have
tried
to
shew
must
always
follow
from
the
use
of
the
naturalistic
fallacy
and
i
hope
i
need
now
say
no
more
about
the
matter
well
then
the
first
step
by
which
mill
has
attempted
to
establish
his
hedonism
is
simply
fallacious
he
has
attempted
to
establish
the
identity
of
the
good
with
the
desired
by
confusing
the
proper
sense
of
desirable
in
which
it
denotes
that
which
it
is
good
to
desire
with
the
sense
which
it
would
bear
if
it
were
analogous
to
such
words
as
if
desirable
is
to
be
identical
with
good
then
it
must
bear
one
sense
and
if
it
is
to
be
identical
with
desired
then
it
must
bear
quite
another
sense
and
yet
to
mill
s
contention
that
the
desired
is
necessarily
good
it
is
quite
essential
that
these
two
senses
of
desirable
should
be
the
same
if
he
holds
they
are
the
same
then
he
has
contradicted
himself
elsewhere
if
he
holds
they
are
not
the
same
then
the
first
step
in
his
proof
of
hedonism
is
absolutely
worthless
but
now
we
must
deal
with
the
second
step
having
proved
as
he
thinks
that
the
good
means
the
desired
mill
recognises
that
if
he
is
further
to
maintain
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
he
must
prove
that
pleasure
alone
is
really
desired
this
doctrine
that
pleasure
alone
is
the
object
of
all
our
desires
is
the
doctrine
which
sidgwick
has
called
psychological
hedonism
and
it
is
a
doctrine
which
most
eminent
psychologists
are
now
agreed
in
rejecting
but
it
is
a
necessary
step
in
the
proof
of
any
such
naturalistic
hedonism
as
mill
s
and
it
is
so
commonly
held
by
people
not
expert
either
in
psychology
or
in
philosophy
that
i
wish
to
treat
it
at
some
length
it
will
be
seen
that
mill
does
not
hold
it
in
this
bare
form
he
admits
that
other
things
than
pleasure
are
desired
and
this
admission
is
at
once
a
contradiction
of
his
hedonism
one
of
the
shifts
by
which
he
seeks
to
evade
this
contradiction
we
shall
afterwards
consider
but
some
may
think
that
no
such
shifts
are
needed
they
may
say
of
mill
what
callicles
says
of
polus
in
the
that
he
has
made
this
fatal
admission
through
a
most
unworthy
fear
of
appearing
paradoxical
that
they
on
the
other
hand
will
have
the
courage
of
their
convictions
and
will
not
be
ashamed
to
go
to
any
lengths
of
paradox
in
defence
of
what
they
hold
to
be
the
truth
b
well
then
we
are
supposing
it
held
that
pleasure
is
the
object
of
all
desire
that
it
is
the
universal
end
of
all
human
activity
now
i
suppose
it
will
not
be
denied
that
people
are
commonly
said
to
desire
other
things
for
instance
we
usually
talk
of
desiring
food
and
drink
of
desiring
money
approbation
fame
the
question
then
must
be
of
what
is
meant
by
desire
and
by
the
object
of
desire
there
is
obviously
asserted
some
sort
of
necessary
or
universal
relation
between
something
which
is
called
desire
and
another
thing
which
is
called
pleasure
the
question
is
of
what
sort
this
relation
is
whether
in
conjunction
with
the
naturalistic
fallacy
above
mentioned
it
will
justify
hedonism
now
i
am
not
prepared
to
deny
that
there
is
some
universal
relation
between
pleasure
and
desire
but
i
hope
to
shew
that
if
there
is
it
is
of
such
sort
as
will
rather
make
against
than
for
hedonism
it
is
urged
that
pleasure
is
always
the
object
of
desire
and
i
am
ready
to
admit
that
pleasure
is
always
in
part
at
least
the
of
desire
but
this
distinction
is
very
important
both
views
might
be
expressed
in
the
same
language
both
might
be
said
to
hold
that
whenever
we
desire
we
always
desire
some
pleasure
if
i
asked
my
supposed
hedonist
why
do
you
desire
that
he
might
answer
quite
consistently
with
his
contention
because
there
is
pleasure
there
and
if
he
asked
me
the
same
question
i
might
answer
equally
consistently
with
my
contention
because
there
is
pleasure
only
our
two
answers
would
not
mean
the
same
thing
it
is
this
use
of
the
same
language
to
denote
quite
different
facts
which
i
believe
to
be
the
chief
cause
why
psychological
hedonism
is
so
often
held
just
as
it
was
also
the
cause
of
mill
s
naturalistic
fallacy
let
us
try
to
analyse
the
psychological
state
which
is
called
that
name
is
usually
confined
to
a
state
of
mind
in
which
the
idea
of
some
object
or
event
not
yet
existing
is
present
to
us
suppose
for
instance
i
am
desiring
a
glass
of
port
wine
i
have
the
idea
of
drinking
such
a
glass
before
my
mind
although
i
am
not
yet
drinking
it
well
how
does
pleasure
enter
in
to
this
relation
my
theory
is
that
it
enters
in
in
this
way
the
of
the
drinking
causes
a
feeling
of
pleasure
in
my
mind
which
helps
to
produce
that
state
of
incipient
activity
which
is
called
it
is
therefore
because
of
a
pleasure
which
i
already
have
the
pleasure
excited
by
a
mere
idea
that
i
desire
the
wine
which
i
have
not
and
i
am
ready
to
admit
that
a
pleasure
of
this
kind
an
actual
pleasure
is
always
among
the
causes
of
every
desire
and
not
only
of
every
desire
but
of
every
mental
activity
whether
conscious
or
i
am
ready
to
this
i
say
i
can
not
vouch
that
it
is
the
true
psychological
doctrine
but
at
all
events
it
is
not
quite
absurd
and
now
what
is
the
other
doctrine
the
doctrine
which
i
am
supposing
held
and
which
is
at
all
events
essential
to
mill
s
argument
it
is
this
that
when
i
desire
the
wine
it
is
not
the
wine
which
i
desire
but
the
pleasure
which
i
expect
to
get
from
it
in
other
words
the
doctrine
is
that
the
idea
of
a
pleasure
is
always
necessary
to
cause
desire
whereas
my
doctrine
was
that
the
pleasure
caused
by
the
idea
of
something
else
was
always
necessary
to
cause
desire
it
is
these
two
different
theories
which
i
suppose
the
psychological
hedonists
to
confuse
the
confusion
is
as
mr
bradley
puts
it
between
a
pleasant
thought
and
the
thought
of
a
it
is
in
fact
only
where
the
latter
the
thought
of
a
pleasure
is
present
that
pleasure
can
be
said
to
be
the
of
desire
or
the
to
action
on
the
other
hand
when
only
a
pleasant
thought
is
present
as
i
admit
always
be
the
case
then
it
is
the
object
of
the
thought
that
which
we
are
thinking
about
which
is
the
object
of
desire
and
the
motive
to
action
and
the
pleasure
which
that
thought
excites
may
indeed
cause
our
desire
or
move
us
to
action
but
it
is
not
our
end
or
object
nor
our
motive
well
i
hope
this
distinction
is
sufficiently
clear
now
let
us
see
how
it
bears
upon
ethical
hedonism
i
assume
it
to
be
perfectly
obvious
that
the
idea
of
the
object
of
desire
is
not
always
and
only
the
idea
of
a
pleasure
in
the
first
place
plainly
we
are
not
always
conscious
of
expecting
pleasure
when
we
desire
a
thing
we
may
be
only
conscious
of
the
thing
which
we
desire
and
may
be
impelled
to
make
for
it
at
once
without
any
calculation
as
to
whether
it
will
bring
us
pleasure
or
pain
and
in
the
second
place
even
when
we
do
expect
pleasure
it
can
certainly
be
very
rarely
pleasure
which
we
desire
for
instance
granted
that
when
i
desire
my
glass
of
port
wine
i
have
also
an
idea
of
the
pleasure
i
expect
from
it
plainly
that
pleasure
can
not
be
the
only
object
of
my
desire
the
port
wine
must
be
included
in
my
object
else
i
might
be
led
by
my
desire
to
take
wormwood
instead
of
wine
if
the
desire
were
directed
towards
the
pleasure
it
could
not
lead
me
to
take
the
wine
if
it
is
to
take
a
definite
direction
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
idea
of
the
object
from
which
the
pleasure
is
expected
should
also
be
present
and
should
control
my
activity
the
theory
then
that
what
is
desired
is
always
and
only
pleasure
must
break
down
it
is
impossible
to
prove
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
by
that
line
of
argument
but
if
we
substitute
for
this
theory
that
other
possibly
true
theory
that
pleasure
is
always
the
cause
of
desire
then
all
the
plausibility
of
our
ethical
doctrine
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
straightway
disappears
for
in
this
case
pleasure
is
not
what
i
desire
it
is
not
what
i
want
it
is
something
which
i
already
have
before
i
can
want
anything
and
can
any
one
feel
inclined
to
maintain
that
that
which
i
already
have
while
i
am
still
desiring
something
else
is
always
and
alone
the
good
but
now
let
us
return
to
consider
another
of
mill
s
arguments
for
his
position
that
happiness
is
the
sole
end
of
human
mill
admits
as
i
have
said
that
pleasure
is
not
the
only
thing
we
actually
desire
the
desire
of
virtue
he
says
is
not
as
universal
but
it
is
as
authentic
a
fact
as
the
desire
of
happiness
and
again
money
is
in
many
cases
desired
in
and
for
itself
these
admissions
are
of
course
in
naked
and
glaring
contradiction
with
his
argument
that
pleasure
is
the
only
thing
desirable
because
it
is
the
only
thing
desired
how
then
does
mill
even
attempt
to
avoid
this
contradiction
his
chief
argument
seems
to
be
that
virtue
money
and
other
such
objects
when
they
are
thus
desired
in
and
for
themselves
are
desired
only
as
a
part
of
happiness
now
what
does
this
mean
happiness
as
we
saw
has
been
defined
by
mill
as
pleasure
and
the
absence
of
does
mill
mean
to
say
that
money
these
actual
coins
which
he
admits
to
be
desired
in
and
for
themselves
are
a
part
either
of
pleasure
or
of
the
absence
of
pain
will
he
maintain
that
those
coins
themselves
are
in
my
mind
and
actually
a
part
of
my
pleasant
feelings
if
this
is
to
be
said
all
words
are
useless
nothing
can
possibly
be
distinguished
from
anything
else
if
these
two
things
are
not
distinct
what
on
earth
is
we
shall
hear
next
that
this
table
is
really
and
truly
the
same
thing
as
this
room
that
a
is
in
fact
indistinguishable
from
st
paul
s
cathedral
that
this
book
of
mill
s
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
because
it
was
his
pleasure
to
produce
it
is
now
and
at
this
moment
a
part
of
the
happiness
which
he
felt
many
years
ago
and
which
has
so
long
ceased
to
be
pray
consider
a
moment
what
this
contemptible
nonsense
really
means
money
says
mill
is
only
desirable
as
a
means
to
perhaps
so
but
what
then
why
says
mill
money
is
undoubtedly
desired
for
its
own
yes
go
on
say
we
well
says
mill
if
money
is
desired
for
its
own
sake
it
must
be
desirable
as
an
i
have
said
so
oh
say
we
but
you
also
said
just
now
that
it
was
only
desirable
as
a
i
own
i
did
says
mill
but
i
will
try
to
patch
up
matters
by
saying
that
what
is
only
a
means
to
an
end
is
the
same
thing
as
a
part
of
that
end
i
daresay
the
public
won
t
and
the
public
haven
t
noticed
yet
this
is
certainly
what
mill
has
done
he
has
broken
down
the
distinction
between
means
and
ends
upon
the
precise
observance
of
which
his
hedonism
rests
and
he
has
been
compelled
to
do
this
because
he
has
failed
to
distinguish
end
in
the
sense
of
what
is
desirable
from
end
in
the
sense
of
what
is
desired
a
distinction
which
nevertheless
both
the
present
argument
and
his
whole
book
presupposes
this
is
a
consequence
of
the
naturalistic
fallacy
pp
mill
then
has
nothing
better
to
say
for
himself
than
this
his
two
fundamental
propositions
are
in
his
own
words
that
to
think
of
an
object
as
desirable
unless
for
the
sake
of
its
consequences
and
to
think
of
it
as
pleasant
are
one
and
the
same
thing
and
that
to
desire
anything
except
in
proportion
as
the
idea
of
it
is
pleasant
is
a
physical
and
metaphysical
impossibility
both
of
these
statements
are
we
have
seen
merely
supported
by
fallacies
the
first
seems
to
rest
on
the
naturalistic
fallacy
the
second
rests
partly
on
this
partly
on
the
fallacy
of
confusing
ends
and
means
and
partly
on
the
fallacy
of
confusing
a
pleasant
thought
with
the
thought
of
a
pleasure
his
very
language
shews
this
for
that
the
idea
of
a
thing
is
pleasant
in
his
second
clause
is
obviously
meant
to
be
the
same
fact
which
he
denotes
by
thinking
of
it
as
pleasant
in
his
first
accordingly
mill
s
arguments
for
the
proposition
that
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
and
our
refutation
of
those
arguments
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
first
of
all
he
takes
the
desirable
which
he
uses
as
a
synonym
for
the
good
to
what
be
desired
the
test
again
of
what
can
be
desired
is
according
to
him
what
actually
is
desired
if
therefore
he
says
we
can
find
some
one
thing
which
is
always
and
alone
desired
that
thing
will
necessarily
be
the
only
thing
that
is
desirable
the
only
thing
that
is
good
as
an
end
in
this
argument
the
naturalistic
fallacy
is
plainly
involved
that
fallacy
i
explained
consists
in
the
contention
that
good
nothing
but
some
simple
or
complex
notion
that
can
be
defined
in
terms
of
natural
qualities
in
mill
s
case
good
is
thus
supposed
to
simply
what
is
desired
and
what
is
desired
is
something
which
can
thus
be
defined
in
natural
terms
mill
tells
us
that
we
ought
to
desire
something
an
ethical
proposition
because
we
actually
do
desire
it
but
if
his
contention
that
i
ought
to
desire
means
nothing
but
i
do
desire
were
true
then
he
is
only
entitled
to
say
we
do
desire
so
and
so
because
we
do
desire
it
and
that
is
not
an
ethical
proposition
at
all
it
is
a
mere
tautology
the
whole
object
of
mill
s
book
is
to
help
us
to
discover
what
we
ought
to
do
but
in
fact
by
attempting
to
define
the
meaning
of
this
ought
he
has
completely
debarred
himself
from
ever
fulfilling
that
object
he
has
confined
himself
to
telling
us
what
we
do
do
mill
s
first
argument
then
is
that
because
good
means
desired
therefore
the
desired
is
good
but
having
thus
arrived
at
an
ethical
conclusion
by
denying
that
any
ethical
conclusion
is
possible
he
still
needs
another
argument
to
make
his
conclusion
a
basis
for
hedonism
he
has
to
prove
that
we
always
do
desire
pleasure
or
freedom
from
pain
and
that
we
never
desire
anything
else
whatever
this
second
doctrine
which
professor
sidgwick
has
called
psychological
hedonism
i
accordingly
discussed
i
pointed
out
how
obviously
untrue
it
is
that
we
never
desire
anything
but
pleasure
and
how
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
ground
for
saying
even
that
whenever
we
desire
anything
we
always
desire
pleasure
well
that
thing
i
attributed
the
obstinate
belief
in
these
untruths
partly
to
a
confusion
between
the
cause
of
desire
and
the
object
of
desire
it
may
i
said
be
true
that
desire
can
never
occur
unless
it
be
preceded
by
some
pleasure
but
even
if
this
is
true
it
obviously
gives
no
ground
for
saying
that
the
object
of
desire
is
always
some
pleasure
by
the
object
of
desire
is
meant
that
of
which
the
idea
causes
desire
in
us
it
is
some
pleasure
which
we
anticipate
some
pleasure
which
we
have
not
got
which
is
the
object
of
desire
whenever
we
do
desire
pleasure
and
any
actual
pleasure
which
may
be
excited
by
the
idea
of
this
anticipated
pleasure
is
obviously
not
the
same
pleasure
as
that
anticipated
pleasure
of
which
only
the
idea
is
actual
this
actual
pleasure
is
not
what
we
want
what
we
want
is
always
something
which
we
have
not
got
and
to
say
that
pleasure
always
causes
us
to
want
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
saying
that
what
we
want
is
always
pleasure
finally
we
saw
mill
admits
all
this
he
insists
that
we
do
desire
other
things
than
pleasure
and
yet
he
says
we
do
desire
nothing
else
he
tries
to
explain
away
this
contradiction
by
confusing
together
two
notions
which
he
has
before
carefully
distinguished
the
notions
of
means
and
of
end
he
now
says
that
a
means
to
an
end
is
the
same
thing
as
a
part
of
that
end
to
this
last
fallacy
special
attention
should
be
given
as
our
ultimate
decision
with
regard
to
hedonism
will
largely
turn
upon
it
it
is
this
ultimate
decision
with
regard
to
hedonism
at
which
we
must
now
try
to
arrive
so
far
i
have
been
only
occupied
with
refuting
mill
s
naturalistic
arguments
for
hedonism
but
the
doctrine
that
pleasure
alone
is
desirable
may
still
be
true
although
mill
s
fallacies
can
not
prove
it
so
this
is
the
question
which
we
have
now
to
face
this
proposition
pleasure
alone
is
good
or
desirable
belongs
undoubtedly
to
that
class
of
propositions
to
which
mill
at
first
rightly
pretended
it
belonged
the
class
of
first
principles
which
are
not
amenable
to
direct
proof
but
in
this
case
as
he
also
rightly
says
considerations
may
be
presented
capable
of
determining
the
intellect
either
to
give
or
withhold
its
assent
to
the
doctrine
it
is
such
considerations
that
professor
sidgwick
presents
and
such
also
that
i
shall
try
to
present
for
the
opposite
view
this
proposition
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
as
an
end
the
fundamental
proposition
of
ethical
hedonism
will
then
appear
in
professor
sidgwick
s
language
as
an
object
of
intuition
i
shall
try
to
shew
you
why
my
intuition
denies
it
just
as
his
intuition
affirms
it
it
always
be
true
notwithstanding
neither
intuition
can
whether
it
is
true
or
not
i
am
bound
to
be
satisfied
if
i
can
present
considerations
capable
of
determining
the
intellect
to
reject
it
now
it
may
be
said
that
this
is
a
very
unsatisfactory
state
of
things
it
is
indeed
but
it
is
important
to
make
a
distinction
between
two
different
reasons
which
may
be
given
for
calling
it
unsatisfactory
is
it
unsatisfactory
because
our
principle
can
not
be
proved
or
is
it
unsatisfactory
merely
because
we
do
not
agree
with
one
another
about
it
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
latter
is
the
chief
reason
for
the
mere
fact
that
in
certain
cases
proof
is
impossible
does
not
usually
give
us
the
least
uneasiness
for
instance
nobody
can
prove
that
this
is
a
chair
beside
me
yet
i
do
not
suppose
that
any
one
is
much
dissatisfied
for
that
reason
we
all
agree
that
it
is
a
chair
and
that
is
enough
to
content
us
although
it
is
quite
possible
we
may
be
wrong
a
madman
of
course
might
come
in
and
say
that
it
is
not
a
chair
but
an
elephant
we
could
not
prove
that
he
was
wrong
and
the
fact
that
he
did
not
agree
with
us
might
then
begin
to
make
us
uneasy
much
more
then
shall
we
be
uneasy
if
some
one
whom
we
do
not
think
to
be
mad
disagrees
with
us
we
shall
try
to
argue
with
him
and
we
shall
probably
be
content
if
we
lead
him
to
agree
with
us
although
we
shall
not
have
proved
our
point
we
can
only
persuade
him
by
shewing
him
that
our
view
is
consistent
with
something
else
which
he
holds
to
be
true
whereas
his
original
view
is
contradictory
to
it
but
it
will
be
impossible
to
prove
that
that
something
else
which
we
both
agree
to
be
true
is
really
so
we
shall
be
satisfied
to
have
settled
the
matter
in
dispute
by
means
of
it
merely
because
we
are
agreed
on
it
in
short
our
dissatisfaction
in
these
cases
is
almost
always
of
the
type
felt
by
the
poor
lunatic
in
the
story
i
said
the
world
was
mad
says
he
and
the
world
said
that
i
was
mad
and
confound
it
they
outvoted
it
is
i
say
almost
always
such
a
disagreement
and
not
the
impossibility
of
proof
which
makes
us
call
the
state
of
things
unsatisfactory
for
indeed
who
can
prove
that
proof
itself
is
a
warrant
of
truth
we
are
all
agreed
that
the
laws
of
logic
are
true
and
therefore
we
accept
a
result
which
is
proved
by
their
means
but
such
a
proof
is
satisfactory
to
us
only
because
we
are
all
so
fully
agreed
that
it
is
a
warrant
of
truth
and
yet
we
can
not
by
the
nature
of
the
case
prove
that
we
are
right
in
being
so
agreed
accordingly
i
do
not
think
we
need
be
much
distressed
by
our
admission
that
we
can
not
prove
whether
pleasure
alone
is
good
or
not
we
may
be
able
to
arrive
at
an
agreement
notwithstanding
and
if
so
i
think
it
will
be
satisfactory
and
yet
i
am
not
very
sanguine
about
our
prospects
of
such
satisfaction
ethics
and
philosophy
in
general
have
always
been
in
a
peculiarly
unsatisfactory
state
there
has
been
no
agreement
about
them
as
there
is
about
the
existence
of
chairs
and
lights
and
benches
i
should
therefore
be
a
fool
if
i
hoped
to
settle
one
great
point
of
controversy
now
and
once
for
all
it
is
extremely
improbable
i
shall
convince
it
would
be
highly
presumptuous
even
to
hope
that
in
the
end
say
two
or
three
centuries
hence
it
will
be
agreed
that
pleasure
is
not
the
sole
good
philosophical
questions
are
so
difficult
the
problems
they
raise
are
so
complex
that
no
one
can
fairly
expect
now
any
more
than
in
the
past
to
win
more
than
a
very
limited
assent
and
yet
i
confess
that
the
considerations
which
i
am
about
to
present
appear
to
me
to
be
absolutely
convincing
i
do
think
that
they
to
convince
if
only
i
can
put
them
well
in
any
case
i
can
but
try
i
try
now
to
put
an
end
to
that
unsatisfactory
state
of
things
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
i
shall
try
to
produce
an
agreement
that
the
fundamental
principle
of
hedonism
is
very
like
an
absurdity
by
shewing
what
it
must
mean
if
it
is
clearly
thought
out
and
how
that
clear
meaning
is
in
conflict
with
other
beliefs
which
will
i
hope
not
be
so
easily
given
up
well
then
we
now
proceed
to
discuss
intuitionistic
hedonism
and
the
beginning
of
this
discussion
marks
it
is
to
be
observed
a
in
my
ethical
method
the
point
i
have
been
labouring
hitherto
the
point
that
good
is
indefinable
and
that
to
deny
this
involves
a
fallacy
is
a
point
capable
of
strict
proof
for
to
deny
it
involves
contradictions
but
now
we
are
coming
to
the
question
for
the
sake
of
answering
which
ethics
exists
the
question
what
things
or
qualities
are
good
of
any
answer
to
question
no
direct
proof
is
possible
and
that
just
because
of
our
former
answer
as
to
the
meaning
of
good
direct
proof
possible
we
are
now
confined
to
the
hope
of
what
mill
calls
indirect
proof
the
hope
of
determining
one
another
s
intellect
and
we
are
now
so
confined
just
because
in
the
matter
of
the
former
question
we
are
not
so
confined
here
then
is
an
intuition
to
be
submitted
to
our
verdict
the
intuition
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
as
an
end
good
in
and
for
well
in
this
connection
it
seems
first
desirable
to
touch
on
another
doctrine
of
mill
s
another
doctrine
which
in
the
interest
of
hedonism
professor
sidgwick
has
done
very
wisely
to
reject
this
is
the
doctrine
of
difference
of
quality
in
if
i
am
asked
says
mill
what
i
mean
by
difference
of
quality
in
pleasures
or
what
makes
one
pleasure
more
valuable
than
another
merely
as
a
pleasure
except
its
being
greater
in
amount
there
is
but
one
possible
answer
of
two
pleasures
if
there
be
one
to
which
all
or
almost
all
who
have
experience
of
both
give
a
decided
preference
irrespective
of
any
feeling
of
moral
obligation
to
prefer
it
that
is
the
more
desirable
pleasure
if
one
of
the
two
is
by
those
who
are
competently
acquainted
with
both
placed
so
far
above
the
other
that
they
prefer
it
even
though
knowing
it
to
be
attended
with
a
greater
amount
of
discontent
and
would
not
resign
it
for
any
quantity
of
the
other
pleasure
which
their
nature
is
capable
of
we
are
justified
in
ascribing
to
the
preferred
enjoyment
a
superiority
in
quality
so
far
outweighing
quantity
as
to
render
it
in
comparison
of
small
now
it
is
well
known
that
bentham
rested
his
case
for
hedonism
on
quantity
of
pleasure
alone
it
was
his
maxim
that
quantity
of
pleasure
being
equal
pushpin
is
as
good
as
and
mill
apparently
considers
bentham
to
have
proved
that
nevertheless
poetry
is
better
than
pushpin
that
poetry
does
produce
a
greater
quantity
of
pleasure
but
yet
says
mill
the
utilitarians
might
have
taken
the
other
and
as
it
may
be
called
higher
ground
with
entire
consistency
now
we
see
from
this
that
mill
acknowledges
quality
of
pleasure
to
be
another
or
different
ground
for
estimating
pleasures
than
bentham
s
quantity
and
moreover
by
that
higher
which
he
afterwards
translates
into
superior
he
seems
to
betray
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
after
all
if
you
take
quantity
of
pleasure
for
your
only
standard
something
may
be
wrong
and
you
may
deserve
to
be
called
a
pig
and
it
may
presently
appear
that
you
very
likely
would
deserve
that
name
but
meanwhile
i
only
wish
to
shew
that
mill
s
admissions
as
to
quality
of
pleasure
are
either
inconsistent
with
his
hedonism
or
else
afford
no
other
ground
for
it
than
would
be
given
by
mere
quantity
of
pleasure
it
will
be
seen
that
mill
s
test
for
one
pleasure
s
superiority
in
quality
over
another
is
the
preference
of
most
people
who
have
experienced
both
a
pleasure
so
preferred
he
holds
is
more
desirable
but
then
as
we
have
seen
he
holds
that
to
think
of
an
object
as
desirable
and
to
think
of
it
as
pleasant
are
one
and
the
same
thing
he
holds
therefore
that
the
preference
of
experts
merely
proves
that
one
pleasure
is
pleasanter
than
another
but
if
that
is
so
how
can
he
distinguish
this
standard
from
the
standard
of
quantity
of
pleasure
can
one
pleasure
be
pleasanter
than
another
except
in
the
sense
that
it
gives
pleasure
pleasant
must
if
words
are
to
have
any
meaning
at
all
denote
some
one
quality
common
to
all
the
things
that
are
pleasant
and
if
so
then
one
thing
can
only
be
more
pleasant
than
another
according
as
it
has
more
or
less
of
this
one
quality
but
then
let
us
try
the
other
alternative
and
suppose
that
mill
does
not
seriously
mean
that
this
preference
of
experts
merely
proves
one
pleasure
to
be
pleasanter
than
another
well
in
this
case
what
does
preferred
mean
it
can
not
mean
more
desired
since
as
we
know
the
degree
of
desire
is
always
according
to
mill
in
exact
proportion
to
the
degree
of
pleasantness
but
in
that
case
the
basis
of
mill
s
hedonism
collapses
for
he
is
admitting
that
one
thing
may
be
preferred
over
another
and
thus
proved
more
desirable
although
it
is
not
more
desired
in
this
case
mill
s
judgment
of
preference
is
just
a
judgment
of
that
intuitional
kind
which
i
have
been
contending
to
be
necessary
to
establish
the
hedonistic
or
any
other
principle
it
is
a
direct
judgment
that
one
thing
is
more
desirable
or
better
than
another
a
judgment
utterly
independent
of
all
considerations
as
to
whether
one
thing
is
more
desired
or
pleasanter
than
another
this
is
to
admit
that
good
is
good
and
indefinable
and
note
another
point
that
is
brought
out
by
this
discussion
mill
s
judgment
of
preference
so
far
from
establishing
the
principle
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
is
obviously
inconsistent
with
it
he
admits
that
experts
can
judge
whether
one
pleasure
is
more
desirable
than
another
because
pleasures
differ
in
quality
but
what
does
this
mean
if
one
pleasure
can
differ
from
another
in
quality
that
means
that
pleasure
is
something
complex
something
composed
in
fact
of
pleasure
addition
that
which
produces
pleasure
for
instance
mill
speaks
of
sensual
indulgences
as
lower
but
what
is
a
sensual
indulgence
it
is
surely
a
certain
excitement
of
some
sense
the
pleasure
caused
by
such
excitement
mill
therefore
in
admitting
that
a
sensual
indulgence
can
be
directly
judged
to
be
lower
than
another
pleasure
in
which
the
degree
of
pleasure
involved
may
be
the
same
is
admitting
that
other
things
may
be
good
or
bad
quite
independently
of
the
pleasure
which
accompanies
them
pleasure
is
in
fact
merely
a
misleading
term
which
conceals
the
fact
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
not
pleasure
but
something
else
which
may
indeed
necessarily
produce
pleasure
but
is
nevertheless
quite
distinct
from
it
mill
therefore
in
thinking
that
to
estimate
quality
of
pleasure
is
quite
consistent
with
his
hedonistic
principle
that
pleasure
and
absence
of
pain
alone
are
desirable
as
ends
has
again
committed
the
fallacy
of
confusing
ends
and
means
for
take
even
the
most
favourable
supposition
of
his
meaning
let
us
suppose
that
by
a
pleasure
he
does
not
mean
as
his
words
imply
that
which
produces
pleasure
and
the
pleasure
produced
let
us
suppose
him
to
mean
that
there
are
various
kinds
of
pleasure
in
the
sense
in
which
there
are
various
kinds
of
colour
blue
red
green
etc
even
in
this
case
if
we
are
to
say
that
our
end
is
colour
alone
then
although
it
is
impossible
we
should
have
colour
without
having
some
particular
colour
yet
the
particular
colour
we
must
have
is
only
a
to
our
having
colour
if
colour
is
really
our
end
and
if
colour
is
our
only
possible
end
as
mill
says
pleasure
is
then
there
can
be
no
possible
reason
for
preferring
one
colour
to
another
red
for
instance
to
blue
except
that
the
one
is
more
of
a
colour
than
the
other
yet
the
opposite
of
this
is
what
mill
is
attempting
to
hold
with
regard
to
pleasures
accordingly
a
consideration
of
mill
s
view
that
some
pleasures
are
superior
to
others
brings
out
one
point
which
may
help
to
determine
the
intellect
with
regard
to
the
intuition
pleasure
is
the
only
for
it
brings
out
the
fact
that
if
you
say
pleasure
you
must
mean
pleasure
you
must
mean
some
one
thing
common
to
all
different
pleasures
some
one
thing
which
may
exist
in
different
degrees
but
which
can
not
differ
in
i
have
pointed
out
that
if
you
say
as
mill
does
that
quality
of
pleasure
is
to
be
taken
into
account
then
you
are
no
longer
holding
that
pleasure
is
good
as
an
end
since
you
imply
that
something
else
something
which
is
present
in
all
pleasures
is
good
as
an
end
the
illustration
i
have
given
from
colour
expresses
this
point
in
its
most
acute
form
it
is
plain
that
if
you
say
colour
alone
is
good
as
an
end
then
you
can
give
no
possible
reason
for
preferring
one
colour
to
another
your
only
standard
of
good
and
bad
will
then
be
colour
and
since
red
and
blue
both
conform
equally
to
this
the
only
standard
you
can
have
no
other
whereby
to
judge
whether
red
is
better
than
blue
it
is
true
that
you
can
not
have
colour
unless
you
also
have
one
or
all
of
the
particular
colours
they
therefore
if
colour
is
the
end
will
all
be
good
as
means
but
none
of
them
can
be
better
than
another
even
as
a
means
far
less
can
any
one
of
them
be
regarded
as
an
end
in
itself
just
so
with
pleasure
if
we
do
really
mean
pleasure
alone
is
good
as
an
end
then
we
must
agree
with
bentham
that
quantity
of
pleasure
being
equal
pushpin
is
as
good
as
to
have
thus
dismissed
mill
s
reference
to
quality
of
pleasure
is
therefore
to
have
made
one
step
in
the
desired
direction
the
reader
will
now
no
longer
be
prevented
from
agreeing
with
me
by
any
idea
that
the
hedonistic
principle
pleasure
alone
is
good
as
an
end
is
consistent
with
the
view
that
one
pleasure
may
be
of
a
better
quality
than
another
these
two
views
we
have
seen
are
contradictory
to
one
another
we
must
choose
between
them
and
if
we
choose
the
latter
then
we
must
give
up
the
principle
of
hedonism
but
as
i
said
professor
sidgwick
has
seen
that
they
are
inconsistent
he
has
seen
that
he
must
choose
between
them
he
has
chosen
he
has
rejected
the
test
by
quality
of
pleasure
and
has
accepted
the
hedonistic
principle
he
still
maintains
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
as
an
i
propose
therefore
to
discuss
the
considerations
which
he
has
offered
in
order
to
convince
us
i
shall
hope
by
that
discussion
to
remove
some
more
of
such
prejudices
and
misunderstandings
as
might
prevent
agreement
with
me
if
i
can
shew
that
some
of
the
considerations
which
professor
sidgwick
urges
are
such
as
we
need
by
no
means
agree
with
and
that
others
are
actually
rather
in
my
favour
than
in
his
we
may
have
again
advanced
a
few
steps
nearer
to
the
unanimity
which
we
desire
the
passages
in
the
of
to
which
i
shall
now
invite
attention
are
to
be
found
in
ix
and
in
iii
xiv
the
first
of
these
two
passages
runs
as
follows
i
think
that
if
we
consider
carefully
such
permanent
results
as
are
commonly
judged
to
be
good
other
than
qualities
of
human
beings
we
can
find
nothing
that
on
reflection
appears
to
possess
this
quality
of
goodness
out
of
relation
to
human
existence
or
at
least
to
some
consciousness
or
feeling
for
example
we
commonly
judge
some
inanimate
objects
scenes
etc
to
be
good
as
possessing
beauty
and
others
bad
from
ugliness
still
no
one
would
consider
it
rational
to
aim
at
the
production
of
beauty
in
external
nature
apart
from
any
possible
contemplation
of
it
by
human
beings
in
fact
when
beauty
is
maintained
to
be
objective
it
is
not
commonly
meant
that
it
exists
as
beauty
out
of
relation
to
any
mind
whatsoever
but
only
that
there
is
some
standard
of
beauty
valid
for
all
minds
it
may
however
be
said
that
beauty
and
other
results
commonly
judged
to
be
good
though
we
do
not
conceive
them
to
exist
out
of
relation
to
human
beings
or
at
least
minds
of
some
kind
are
yet
so
far
separable
as
ends
from
the
human
beings
on
whom
their
existence
depends
that
their
realization
may
conceivably
come
into
competition
with
the
perfection
or
happiness
of
these
beings
thus
though
beautiful
things
can
not
be
thought
worth
producing
except
as
possible
objects
of
contemplation
still
a
man
may
devote
himself
to
their
production
without
any
consideration
of
the
persons
who
are
to
contemplate
them
similarly
knowledge
is
a
good
which
can
not
exist
except
in
minds
and
yet
one
may
be
more
interested
in
the
development
of
knowledge
than
in
its
possession
by
any
particular
minds
and
may
take
the
former
as
an
ultimate
end
without
regarding
the
latter
still
as
soon
as
the
alternatives
are
clearly
apprehended
it
will
i
think
be
generally
held
that
beauty
knowledge
and
other
ideal
goods
as
well
as
all
external
material
things
are
only
reasonably
to
be
sought
by
men
in
so
far
as
they
conduce
to
happiness
or
to
the
perfection
or
excellence
of
human
existence
i
say
human
for
though
most
utilitarians
consider
the
pleasure
and
freedom
from
pain
of
the
inferior
animals
to
be
included
in
the
happiness
which
they
take
as
the
right
and
proper
end
of
conduct
no
one
seems
to
contend
that
we
ought
to
aim
at
perfecting
brutes
except
as
a
means
to
our
ends
or
at
least
as
objects
of
scientific
or
æsthetic
contemplation
for
us
nor
again
can
we
include
as
a
practical
end
the
existence
of
beings
above
the
human
we
certainly
apply
the
idea
of
good
to
the
divine
existence
just
as
we
do
to
his
work
and
indeed
in
a
preeminent
manner
and
when
it
is
said
that
we
should
do
all
things
to
the
glory
of
god
it
may
seem
to
be
implied
that
the
existence
of
god
is
made
better
by
our
glorifying
him
still
this
inference
when
explicitly
drawn
appears
somewhat
impious
and
theologians
generally
recoil
from
it
and
refrain
from
using
the
notion
of
a
possible
addition
to
the
goodness
of
the
divine
existence
as
a
ground
of
human
duty
nor
can
the
influence
of
our
actions
on
other
intelligences
besides
the
divine
be
at
present
made
matter
of
scientific
discussion
i
shall
therefore
confidently
lay
down
that
if
there
be
any
good
other
than
happiness
to
be
sought
by
man
as
an
ultimate
practical
end
it
can
only
be
the
goodness
perfection
or
excellence
of
human
existence
how
far
this
notion
includes
more
than
virtue
what
its
precise
relation
to
pleasure
is
and
to
what
method
we
shall
be
logically
led
if
we
accept
it
as
fundamental
are
questions
which
we
shall
more
conveniently
discuss
after
the
detailed
examination
of
these
two
other
notions
pleasure
and
virtue
in
which
we
shall
be
engaged
in
the
two
following
it
will
be
observed
that
in
this
passage
sidgwick
tries
to
limit
the
range
of
objects
among
which
the
ultimate
end
may
be
found
he
does
not
yet
say
what
that
end
is
but
he
does
exclude
from
it
everything
but
certain
characters
of
human
existence
and
the
possible
ends
which
he
thus
excludes
do
not
again
come
up
for
consideration
they
are
put
out
of
court
once
for
all
by
this
passage
and
by
this
passage
only
now
is
this
exclusion
justified
i
can
not
think
it
is
no
one
says
sidgwick
would
consider
it
rational
to
aim
at
the
production
of
beauty
in
external
nature
apart
from
any
possible
contemplation
of
it
by
human
well
i
may
say
at
once
that
i
for
one
do
consider
this
rational
and
let
us
see
if
i
can
not
get
any
one
to
agree
with
me
consider
what
this
admission
really
means
it
entitles
us
to
put
the
following
case
let
us
imagine
one
world
exceedingly
beautiful
imagine
it
as
beautiful
as
you
can
put
into
it
whatever
on
this
earth
you
most
admire
mountains
rivers
the
sea
trees
and
sunsets
stars
and
moon
imagine
these
all
combined
in
the
most
exquisite
proportions
so
that
no
one
thing
jars
against
another
but
each
contributes
to
increase
the
beauty
of
the
whole
and
then
imagine
the
ugliest
world
you
can
possibly
conceive
imagine
it
simply
one
heap
of
filth
containing
everything
that
is
most
disgusting
to
us
for
whatever
reason
and
the
whole
as
far
as
may
be
without
one
redeeming
feature
such
a
pair
of
worlds
we
are
entitled
to
compare
they
fall
within
sidgwick
s
meaning
and
the
comparison
is
highly
relevant
to
it
the
only
thing
we
are
not
entitled
to
imagine
is
that
any
human
being
ever
has
or
ever
by
any
possibility
live
in
either
can
ever
see
and
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
one
or
hate
the
foulness
of
the
other
well
even
so
supposing
them
quite
apart
from
any
possible
contemplation
by
human
beings
still
is
it
irrational
to
hold
that
it
is
better
that
the
beautiful
world
should
exist
than
the
one
which
is
ugly
would
it
not
be
well
in
any
case
to
do
what
we
could
to
produce
it
rather
than
the
other
certainly
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
it
would
and
i
hope
that
some
may
agree
with
me
in
this
extreme
instance
the
instance
is
extreme
it
is
highly
improbable
not
to
say
impossible
we
should
ever
have
such
a
choice
before
us
in
any
actual
choice
we
should
have
to
consider
the
possible
effects
of
our
action
upon
conscious
beings
and
among
these
possible
effects
there
are
always
some
i
think
which
ought
to
be
preferred
to
the
existence
of
mere
beauty
but
this
only
means
that
in
our
present
state
in
which
but
a
very
small
portion
of
the
good
is
attainable
the
pursuit
of
beauty
for
its
own
sake
must
always
be
postponed
to
the
pursuit
of
some
greater
good
which
is
equally
attainable
but
it
is
enough
for
my
purpose
if
it
be
admitted
that
no
greater
good
were
at
all
attainable
then
beauty
must
in
itself
be
regarded
as
a
greater
good
than
ugliness
if
it
be
admitted
that
in
that
case
we
should
not
be
left
without
any
reason
for
preferring
one
course
of
action
to
another
we
should
not
be
left
without
any
duty
whatever
but
that
it
would
then
be
our
positive
duty
to
make
the
world
more
beautiful
so
far
as
we
were
able
since
nothing
better
than
beauty
could
then
result
from
our
efforts
if
this
be
once
admitted
if
in
any
imaginable
case
you
do
admit
that
the
existence
of
a
more
beautiful
thing
is
better
in
itself
than
that
of
one
more
ugly
quite
apart
from
its
effects
on
any
human
feeling
then
sidgwick
s
principle
has
broken
down
then
we
shall
have
to
include
in
our
ultimate
end
something
beyond
the
limits
of
human
existence
i
admit
of
course
that
our
beautiful
world
would
be
better
still
if
there
were
human
beings
in
it
to
contemplate
and
enjoy
its
beauty
but
that
admission
makes
nothing
against
my
point
if
it
be
once
admitted
that
the
beautiful
world
is
better
than
the
ugly
then
it
follows
that
however
many
beings
may
enjoy
it
and
however
much
better
their
enjoyment
may
be
than
it
is
itself
yet
its
mere
existence
adds
to
the
goodness
of
the
whole
it
is
not
only
a
means
to
our
end
but
also
itself
a
part
thereof
in
the
second
passage
to
which
i
referred
above
sidgwick
returns
from
the
discussion
of
virtue
and
pleasure
with
which
he
has
meanwhile
been
engaged
to
consider
what
among
the
parts
of
human
existence
to
which
as
we
saw
he
has
limited
the
ultimate
end
can
really
be
considered
as
such
end
what
i
have
just
said
of
course
appears
to
me
to
destroy
the
force
of
this
part
of
his
argument
too
if
as
i
think
other
things
than
any
part
of
human
existence
can
be
then
sidgwick
can
not
claim
to
have
discovered
the
summum
bonum
when
he
has
merely
determined
what
parts
of
human
existence
are
in
themselves
desirable
but
this
error
may
be
admitted
to
be
utterly
insignificant
in
comparison
with
that
which
we
are
now
about
to
discuss
it
may
be
said
says
sidgwick
iii
xiv
that
we
may
regard
cognition
of
truth
contemplation
of
beauty
free
or
virtuous
action
as
in
some
measure
preferable
alternatives
to
pleasure
or
happiness
even
though
we
admit
that
happiness
must
be
included
as
a
part
of
ultimate
good
i
think
however
that
this
view
ought
not
to
commend
itself
to
the
sober
judgment
of
reflective
persons
in
order
to
shew
this
i
must
ask
the
reader
to
use
the
same
twofold
procedure
that
i
before
requested
him
to
employ
in
considering
the
absolute
and
independent
validity
of
common
moral
precepts
i
appeal
firstly
to
his
intuitive
judgment
after
due
consideration
of
the
question
when
fairly
placed
before
it
and
secondly
to
a
comprehensive
comparison
of
the
ordinary
judgments
of
mankind
as
regards
the
first
argument
to
me
at
least
it
seems
clear
after
reflection
that
these
objective
relations
of
the
conscious
subject
when
distinguished
from
the
consciousness
accompanying
and
resulting
from
them
are
not
ultimately
and
intrinsically
desirable
any
more
than
material
or
other
objects
are
when
considered
apart
from
any
relation
to
conscious
existence
admitting
that
we
have
actual
experience
of
such
preferences
as
have
just
been
described
of
which
the
ultimate
object
is
something
that
is
not
merely
consciousness
it
still
seems
to
me
that
when
to
use
butler
s
phrase
we
sit
down
in
a
cool
hour
we
can
only
justify
to
ourselves
the
importance
that
we
attach
to
any
of
these
objects
by
considering
its
conduciveness
in
one
way
or
another
to
the
happiness
of
sentient
beings
the
second
argument
that
refers
to
the
common
sense
of
mankind
obviously
can
not
be
made
completely
cogent
since
as
above
stated
several
cultivated
persons
do
habitually
judge
that
knowledge
art
not
to
speak
of
virtue
are
ends
independently
of
the
pleasure
derived
from
them
but
we
may
urge
not
only
that
all
these
elements
of
ideal
good
are
productive
of
pleasure
in
various
ways
but
also
that
they
seem
to
obtain
the
commendation
of
common
sense
roughly
speaking
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
this
productiveness
this
seems
obviously
true
of
beauty
and
will
hardly
be
denied
in
respect
of
any
kind
of
social
ideal
it
is
paradoxical
to
maintain
that
any
degree
of
freedom
or
any
form
of
social
order
would
still
be
commonly
regarded
as
desirable
even
if
we
were
certain
that
it
had
no
tendency
to
promote
the
general
happiness
the
case
of
knowledge
is
rather
more
complex
but
certainly
common
sense
is
most
impressed
with
the
value
of
knowledge
when
its
fruitfulness
has
been
demonstrated
it
is
however
aware
that
experience
has
frequently
shewn
how
knowledge
long
fruitless
may
become
unexpectedly
fruitful
and
how
light
may
be
shed
on
one
part
of
the
field
of
knowledge
from
another
apparently
remote
and
even
if
any
particular
branch
of
scientific
pursuit
could
be
shewn
to
be
devoid
of
even
this
indirect
utility
it
would
still
deserve
some
respect
on
utilitarian
grounds
both
as
furnishing
to
the
inquirer
the
refined
and
innocent
pleasures
of
curiosity
and
because
the
intellectual
disposition
which
it
exhibits
and
sustains
is
likely
on
the
whole
to
produce
fruitful
knowledge
still
in
cases
approximating
to
this
last
common
sense
is
somewhat
disposed
to
complain
of
the
of
valuable
effort
so
that
the
meed
of
honour
commonly
paid
to
science
seems
to
be
graduated
though
perhaps
unconsciously
by
a
tolerably
exact
utilitarian
scale
certainly
the
moment
the
legitimacy
of
any
branch
of
scientific
inquiry
is
seriously
disputed
as
in
the
recent
case
of
vivisection
the
controversy
on
both
sides
is
generally
conducted
on
an
avowedly
utilitarian
basis
the
case
of
virtue
requires
special
consideration
since
the
encouragement
in
each
other
of
virtuous
impulses
and
dispositions
is
a
main
aim
of
men
s
ordinary
moral
discourse
so
that
even
to
raise
the
question
whether
this
encouragement
can
go
too
far
has
a
paradoxical
air
still
our
experience
includes
rare
and
exceptional
cases
in
which
the
concentration
of
effort
on
the
cultivation
of
virtue
has
seemed
to
have
effects
adverse
to
general
happiness
through
being
intensified
to
the
point
of
moral
fanaticism
and
so
involving
a
neglect
of
other
conditions
of
happiness
if
then
we
admit
as
actual
or
possible
such
infelicific
effects
of
the
cultivation
of
virtue
i
think
we
shall
also
generally
admit
that
in
the
case
supposed
conduciveness
to
general
happiness
should
be
the
criterion
for
deciding
how
far
the
cultivation
of
virtue
should
be
there
we
have
sidgwick
s
argument
completed
we
ought
not
he
thinks
to
aim
at
knowing
the
truth
or
at
contemplating
beauty
except
in
so
far
as
such
knowledge
or
such
contemplation
contributes
to
increase
the
pleasure
or
to
diminish
the
pain
of
sentient
beings
pleasure
alone
is
good
for
its
own
sake
knowledge
of
the
truth
is
good
only
as
a
means
to
pleasure
let
us
consider
what
this
means
what
is
pleasure
it
is
certainly
something
of
which
we
may
be
conscious
and
which
therefore
may
be
distinguished
from
our
consciousness
of
it
what
i
wish
first
to
ask
is
this
can
it
really
be
said
that
we
value
pleasure
except
in
so
far
as
we
are
conscious
of
it
should
we
think
that
the
attainment
of
pleasure
of
which
we
never
were
and
never
could
be
conscious
was
something
to
be
aimed
at
for
its
own
sake
it
may
be
impossible
that
such
pleasure
should
ever
exist
that
it
should
ever
be
thus
divorced
from
consciousness
although
there
is
certainly
much
reason
to
believe
that
it
is
not
only
possible
but
very
common
but
even
supposing
that
it
were
impossible
that
is
quite
irrelevant
our
question
is
is
it
the
pleasure
as
distinct
from
the
consciousness
of
it
that
we
set
value
on
do
we
think
the
pleasure
valuable
in
itself
or
must
we
insist
that
if
we
are
to
think
the
pleasure
good
we
must
have
consciousness
of
it
too
this
consideration
is
very
well
put
by
socrates
in
plato
s
dialogue
a
would
accept
protarchus
says
socrates
to
live
your
whole
life
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
greatest
pleasures
of
course
i
would
says
protarchus
then
would
you
think
you
needed
anything
else
besides
if
you
possessed
this
one
blessing
in
completeness
certainly
not
consider
what
you
are
saying
you
would
not
need
to
be
wise
and
intelligent
and
reasonable
nor
anything
like
this
would
you
not
even
care
to
keep
your
sight
why
should
i
i
suppose
i
should
have
all
i
want
if
i
was
pleased
well
then
supposing
you
lived
so
you
would
enjoy
always
throughout
your
life
the
greatest
pleasure
of
course
but
on
the
other
hand
inasmuch
as
you
would
possess
intelligence
and
memory
and
knowledge
and
true
opinion
you
would
in
the
first
place
necessarily
be
without
the
knowledge
whether
you
were
pleased
or
not
for
you
would
be
devoid
of
any
kind
of
wisdom
you
admit
this
i
do
the
consequence
is
absolutely
necessary
well
then
besides
this
not
having
memory
you
must
also
be
unable
to
remember
even
that
you
ever
were
pleased
of
the
pleasure
which
falls
upon
you
at
the
moment
not
the
least
vestige
must
afterwards
remain
and
again
not
having
true
opinion
you
can
not
think
that
you
are
pleased
when
you
are
and
being
bereft
of
your
reasoning
faculties
you
can
not
even
have
the
power
to
reckon
that
you
will
be
pleased
in
future
you
must
live
the
life
of
an
oyster
or
of
some
other
of
those
living
creatures
whose
home
is
the
seas
and
whose
souls
are
concealed
in
shelly
bodies
is
all
this
so
or
can
we
think
otherwise
than
this
how
can
we
well
then
can
we
think
such
a
life
desirable
socrates
your
reasoning
has
left
me
utterly
socrates
we
see
persuades
protarchus
that
hedonism
is
absurd
if
we
are
really
going
to
maintain
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
as
an
end
we
must
maintain
that
it
is
good
whether
we
are
conscious
of
it
or
not
we
must
declare
it
reasonable
to
take
as
our
ideal
an
unattainable
ideal
it
may
be
that
we
should
be
as
happy
as
possible
even
on
condition
that
we
never
know
and
never
can
know
that
we
are
happy
we
must
be
willing
to
sell
in
exchange
for
the
mere
happiness
every
vestige
of
knowledge
both
in
ourselves
and
in
others
both
of
happiness
itself
and
of
every
other
thing
can
we
really
still
disagree
can
any
one
still
declare
it
obvious
that
this
is
reasonable
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
as
an
end
the
case
it
is
plain
is
just
like
that
of
the
colours
only
as
yet
not
nearly
so
strong
it
is
far
more
possible
that
we
should
some
day
be
able
to
produce
the
intensest
pleasure
without
any
consciousness
that
it
is
there
than
that
we
should
be
able
to
produce
mere
colour
without
its
being
any
particular
colour
pleasure
and
consciousness
can
be
far
more
easily
distinguished
from
one
another
than
colour
from
the
particular
colours
and
yet
even
if
this
were
not
so
we
should
be
bound
to
distinguish
them
if
we
really
wished
to
declare
pleasure
alone
to
be
our
ultimate
end
even
if
consciousness
were
an
inseparable
accompaniment
of
pleasure
a
quâ
of
its
existence
yet
if
pleasure
is
the
only
end
we
are
bound
to
call
consciousness
a
mere
to
it
in
any
intelligible
sense
that
can
be
given
to
the
word
and
if
on
the
other
hand
as
i
hope
is
now
plain
the
pleasure
would
be
comparatively
valueless
without
the
consciousness
then
we
are
bound
to
say
that
pleasure
is
the
only
end
that
some
consciousness
at
least
must
be
included
with
it
as
a
veritable
part
of
the
end
for
our
question
now
is
solely
what
the
end
is
it
is
quite
another
question
how
far
that
end
may
be
attainable
or
must
involve
the
simultaneous
attainment
of
other
things
it
may
well
be
that
the
conclusions
at
which
utilitarians
do
arrive
and
even
those
at
which
they
ought
logically
to
arrive
are
not
far
from
the
truth
but
in
so
far
as
their
for
holding
these
conclusions
to
be
true
is
that
pleasure
alone
is
good
as
an
end
they
are
wrong
and
it
is
with
that
we
are
chiefly
concerned
in
any
scientific
ethics
it
seems
then
clear
that
hedonism
is
in
error
so
far
as
it
maintains
that
pleasure
alone
and
not
the
consciousness
of
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
and
this
error
seems
largely
due
to
the
fallacy
which
i
pointed
out
above
in
mill
the
fallacy
of
confusing
means
and
end
it
is
falsely
supposed
that
since
pleasure
must
always
be
accompanied
by
consciousness
which
is
itself
extremely
doubtful
therefore
it
is
indifferent
whether
we
say
that
pleasure
or
the
consciousness
of
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
of
course
it
would
be
indifferent
at
which
we
aimed
if
it
were
certain
that
we
could
not
get
the
one
without
the
other
but
where
the
question
is
of
what
is
good
in
itself
where
we
ask
for
the
sake
of
what
is
it
desirable
to
get
that
which
we
aim
at
the
distinction
is
by
no
means
unimportant
here
we
are
placed
before
an
exclusive
alternative
pleasure
by
itself
even
though
we
can
t
get
it
would
be
all
that
is
desirable
a
consciousness
of
it
would
be
more
desirable
still
both
these
propositions
can
not
be
true
and
i
think
it
is
plain
that
the
latter
is
true
whence
it
follows
that
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
still
it
may
be
said
that
even
if
consciousness
of
pleasure
and
not
pleasure
alone
is
the
sole
good
this
conclusion
is
not
very
damaging
to
hedonism
it
may
be
said
that
hedonists
have
always
meant
by
pleasure
the
consciousness
of
pleasure
though
they
have
not
been
at
pains
to
say
so
and
this
i
think
is
in
the
main
true
to
correct
their
formula
in
this
respect
could
therefore
only
be
a
matter
of
practical
importance
if
it
is
possible
to
produce
pleasure
without
producing
consciousness
of
it
but
even
this
importance
which
i
think
our
conclusion
so
far
really
has
is
i
admit
comparatively
slight
what
i
wish
to
maintain
is
that
even
consciousness
of
pleasure
is
not
the
sole
good
that
indeed
it
is
absurd
so
to
regard
it
and
the
chief
importance
of
what
has
been
said
so
far
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
same
method
which
shews
that
consciousness
of
pleasure
is
more
valuable
than
pleasure
seems
also
to
shew
that
consciousness
of
pleasure
is
itself
far
less
valuable
than
other
things
the
supposition
that
consciousness
of
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
is
due
to
a
neglect
of
the
same
distinctions
which
have
encouraged
the
careless
assertion
that
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
the
method
which
i
employed
in
order
to
shew
that
pleasure
itself
was
not
the
sole
good
was
that
of
considering
what
value
we
should
attach
to
it
if
it
existed
in
absolute
isolation
stripped
of
all
its
usual
accompaniments
and
this
is
in
fact
the
only
method
that
can
be
safely
used
when
we
wish
to
discover
what
degree
of
value
a
thing
has
in
itself
the
necessity
of
employing
this
method
will
be
best
exhibited
by
a
discussion
of
the
arguments
used
by
sidgwick
in
the
passage
last
quoted
and
by
an
exposure
of
the
manner
in
which
they
are
calculated
to
mislead
with
regard
to
the
second
of
them
it
only
maintains
that
other
things
which
might
be
supposed
to
share
with
pleasure
the
attribute
of
goodness
seem
to
obtain
the
commendation
of
common
sense
roughly
speaking
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
their
productiveness
of
pleasure
whether
even
this
rough
proportion
holds
between
the
commendation
of
common
sense
and
the
felicific
effects
of
that
which
it
commends
is
a
question
extremely
difficult
to
determine
and
we
need
not
enter
into
it
here
for
even
assuming
it
to
be
true
and
assuming
the
judgments
of
common
sense
to
be
on
the
whole
correct
what
would
it
shew
it
would
shew
certainly
that
pleasure
was
a
good
of
right
action
that
the
same
conduct
which
produced
most
pleasure
would
also
produce
most
good
on
the
whole
but
this
would
by
no
means
entitle
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
greatest
pleasure
what
was
best
on
the
whole
it
would
still
leave
open
the
alternative
that
the
greatest
quantity
of
pleasure
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
actual
generally
accompanied
by
the
greatest
quantity
of
and
that
it
therefore
was
the
sole
good
it
might
indeed
seem
to
be
a
strange
coincidence
that
these
two
things
should
always
even
in
this
world
be
in
proportion
to
one
another
but
the
strangeness
of
this
coincidence
will
certainly
not
entitle
us
to
argue
directly
that
it
does
not
exist
that
it
is
an
illusion
due
to
the
fact
that
pleasure
is
really
the
sole
good
the
coincidence
may
be
susceptible
of
other
explanations
and
it
would
even
be
our
duty
to
accept
it
unexplained
if
direct
intuition
seemed
to
declare
that
pleasure
was
not
the
sole
good
moreover
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
need
for
assuming
such
a
coincidence
rests
in
any
case
upon
the
extremely
doubtful
proposition
that
felicific
effects
roughly
in
proportion
to
the
approval
of
common
sense
and
it
should
be
observed
that
though
sidgwick
maintains
this
to
be
the
case
his
detailed
illustrations
only
tend
to
shew
the
very
different
proposition
that
a
thing
is
not
held
to
be
good
unless
it
gives
a
balance
of
pleasure
not
that
the
degree
of
commendation
is
in
proportion
to
the
quantity
of
pleasure
the
decision
then
must
rest
upon
sidgwick
s
first
argument
the
appeal
to
our
intuitive
judgment
after
due
consideration
of
the
question
when
fairly
placed
before
and
here
it
seems
to
me
plain
that
sidgwick
has
failed
in
two
essential
respects
to
place
the
question
fairly
before
either
himself
or
his
reader
what
he
has
to
shew
is
as
he
says
himself
not
merely
that
happiness
must
be
included
as
a
part
of
ultimate
this
view
he
says
ought
not
to
commend
itself
to
the
sober
judgment
of
reflective
and
why
because
these
objective
relations
when
distinguished
from
the
consciousness
accompanying
and
resulting
from
them
are
not
ultimately
and
intrinsically
now
this
reason
which
is
offered
as
shewing
that
to
consider
happiness
as
a
mere
part
of
ultimate
good
does
not
meet
the
facts
of
intuition
is
on
the
contrary
only
sufficient
to
shew
that
it
a
part
of
ultimate
good
for
from
the
fact
that
no
value
resides
in
one
part
of
a
whole
considered
by
itself
we
can
not
infer
that
all
the
value
belonging
to
the
whole
does
reside
in
the
other
part
considered
by
itself
even
if
we
admit
that
there
is
much
value
in
the
enjoyment
of
beauty
and
none
in
the
mere
contemplation
of
it
which
is
one
of
the
constituents
of
that
complex
fact
it
does
not
follow
that
all
the
value
belongs
to
the
other
constituent
namely
the
pleasure
which
we
take
in
contemplating
it
it
is
quite
possible
that
this
constituent
also
has
no
value
in
itself
that
the
value
belongs
to
the
whole
state
and
to
that
only
so
that
the
pleasure
the
contemplation
are
mere
parts
of
the
good
and
both
of
them
equally
necessary
parts
in
short
sidgwick
s
argument
here
depends
upon
the
neglect
of
that
principle
which
i
tried
to
explain
in
my
first
chapter
and
which
i
said
i
should
call
the
principle
of
organic
relations
the
argument
is
calculated
to
mislead
because
it
supposes
that
if
we
see
a
whole
state
to
be
valuable
and
also
see
that
one
element
of
that
state
has
no
value
then
the
other
element
must
have
all
the
value
which
belongs
to
the
whole
state
the
fact
is
on
the
contrary
that
since
the
whole
may
be
organic
the
other
element
need
have
no
value
whatever
and
that
even
if
it
have
some
the
value
of
the
whole
may
be
very
much
greater
for
this
reason
as
well
as
to
avoid
confusion
between
means
and
end
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
consider
each
distinguishable
quality
in
order
to
decide
what
value
it
possesses
sidgwick
on
the
other
hand
applies
this
method
of
isolation
only
to
element
in
the
wholes
he
is
considering
he
does
not
ask
the
question
if
consciousness
of
pleasure
existed
absolutely
by
itself
would
a
sober
judgment
be
able
to
attribute
much
value
to
it
it
is
in
fact
always
misleading
to
take
a
whole
that
is
valuable
or
the
reverse
and
then
to
ask
simply
to
which
of
its
constituents
does
this
whole
owe
its
value
or
its
vileness
it
may
well
be
that
it
owes
it
to
and
if
one
of
them
does
appear
to
have
some
value
in
itself
we
shall
be
led
into
the
grave
error
of
supposing
that
all
the
value
of
the
whole
belongs
to
it
alone
it
seems
to
me
that
this
error
has
commonly
been
committed
with
regard
to
pleasure
pleasure
does
seem
to
be
a
necessary
constituent
of
most
valuable
wholes
and
since
the
other
constituents
into
which
we
may
analyse
them
may
easily
seem
not
to
have
any
value
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
all
the
value
belongs
to
pleasure
that
this
natural
supposition
does
not
follow
from
the
premises
is
certain
and
that
it
is
on
the
contrary
ridiculously
far
from
the
truth
appears
evident
to
my
reflective
if
we
apply
either
to
pleasure
or
to
consciousness
of
pleasure
the
only
safe
method
that
of
isolation
and
ask
ourselves
could
we
accept
as
a
very
good
thing
that
mere
consciousness
of
pleasure
and
absolutely
nothing
else
should
exist
even
in
the
greatest
quantities
i
think
we
can
have
no
doubt
about
answering
no
far
less
can
we
accept
this
as
the
good
even
if
we
accept
sidgwick
s
implication
which
yet
appears
to
me
extremely
doubtful
that
consciousness
of
pleasure
has
a
greater
value
by
itself
than
contemplation
of
beauty
it
seems
to
me
that
a
pleasurable
contemplation
of
beauty
has
certainly
an
immeasurably
greater
value
than
mere
consciousness
of
pleasure
in
favour
of
this
conclusion
i
can
appeal
with
confidence
to
the
sober
judgment
of
reflective
pp
that
the
value
of
a
pleasurable
whole
does
not
belong
solely
to
the
pleasure
which
it
contains
may
i
think
be
made
still
plainer
by
consideration
of
another
point
in
which
sidgwick
s
argument
is
defective
sidgwick
maintains
as
we
saw
the
doubtful
proposition
that
the
to
pleasure
of
a
thing
is
in
rough
proportion
to
its
commendation
by
common
sense
but
he
does
not
maintain
what
would
be
undoubtedly
false
that
the
pleasantness
of
every
state
is
in
proportion
to
the
commendation
of
that
state
in
other
words
it
is
only
when
you
take
into
account
whole
consequences
of
any
that
he
is
able
to
maintain
the
coincidence
of
quantity
of
pleasure
with
the
objects
approved
by
common
sense
if
we
consider
each
state
by
itself
and
ask
what
is
the
judgment
of
common
sense
as
to
its
goodness
an
quite
apart
from
its
goodness
as
a
means
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
common
sense
holds
many
much
less
pleasant
states
to
be
better
than
many
far
more
pleasant
that
it
holds
with
mill
that
there
are
higher
pleasures
which
are
more
valuable
though
less
pleasant
than
those
which
are
lower
sidgwick
might
of
course
maintain
that
in
this
common
sense
is
merely
confusing
means
and
ends
that
what
it
holds
to
be
better
as
an
end
is
in
reality
only
better
as
a
means
but
i
think
his
argument
is
defective
in
that
he
does
not
seem
to
see
sufficiently
plainly
that
as
far
as
intuitions
of
goodness
an
are
concerned
he
is
running
grossly
counter
to
common
sense
that
he
does
not
emphasise
sufficiently
the
distinction
between
pleasantness
and
to
pleasure
in
order
to
place
fairly
before
us
the
question
what
is
good
as
an
end
we
must
take
states
that
are
immediately
pleasant
and
ask
if
the
more
pleasant
are
always
also
the
better
and
whether
if
some
that
are
less
pleasant
appear
to
be
so
it
is
only
because
we
think
they
are
likely
to
increase
the
number
of
the
more
pleasant
that
common
sense
would
deny
both
these
suppositions
and
rightly
so
appears
to
me
indubitable
it
is
commonly
held
that
certain
of
what
would
be
called
the
lowest
forms
of
sexual
enjoyment
for
instance
are
positively
bad
although
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
they
are
not
the
most
pleasant
states
we
ever
experience
common
sense
would
certainly
not
think
it
a
sufficient
justification
for
the
pursuit
of
what
sidgwick
calls
the
refined
pleasures
here
and
now
that
they
are
the
best
means
to
the
future
attainment
of
a
heaven
in
which
there
would
be
no
more
refined
pleasures
no
contemplation
of
beauty
no
personal
affections
but
in
which
the
greatest
possible
pleasure
would
be
obtained
by
a
perpetual
indulgence
in
bestiality
yet
sidgwick
would
be
bound
to
hold
that
if
the
greatest
possible
pleasure
could
be
obtained
in
this
way
and
if
it
were
attainable
such
a
state
of
things
would
be
a
heaven
indeed
and
that
all
human
endeavours
should
be
devoted
to
its
realisation
i
venture
to
think
that
this
view
is
as
false
as
it
is
paradoxical
it
seems
to
me
then
that
if
we
place
fairly
before
us
the
question
is
consciousness
of
pleasure
the
sole
good
the
answer
must
be
no
and
with
this
the
last
defence
of
hedonism
has
been
broken
down
in
order
to
put
the
question
fairly
we
must
isolate
consciousness
of
pleasure
we
must
ask
suppose
we
were
conscious
of
pleasure
only
and
of
nothing
else
not
even
that
we
conscious
would
that
state
of
things
however
great
the
quantity
be
very
desirable
no
one
i
think
can
suppose
it
so
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
quite
plain
that
we
do
regard
as
very
desirable
many
complicated
states
of
mind
in
which
the
consciousness
of
pleasure
is
combined
with
consciousness
of
other
things
states
which
we
call
enjoyment
of
so
and
so
if
this
is
correct
then
it
follows
that
consciousness
of
pleasure
is
not
the
sole
good
and
that
many
other
states
in
which
it
is
included
as
a
part
are
much
better
than
it
once
we
recognise
the
principle
of
organic
unities
any
objection
to
this
conclusion
founded
on
the
supposed
fact
that
the
other
elements
of
such
states
have
no
value
in
themselves
must
disappear
and
i
do
not
know
that
i
need
say
any
more
in
refutation
of
hedonism
it
only
remains
to
say
something
of
the
two
forms
in
which
a
hedonistic
doctrine
is
commonly
held
egoism
and
utilitarianism
egoism
as
a
form
of
hedonism
is
the
doctrine
which
holds
that
we
ought
each
of
us
to
pursue
our
own
greatest
happiness
as
our
ultimate
end
the
doctrine
will
of
course
admit
that
sometimes
the
best
means
to
this
end
will
be
to
give
pleasure
to
others
we
shall
for
instance
by
so
doing
procure
for
ourselves
the
pleasures
of
sympathy
of
freedom
from
interference
and
of
and
these
pleasures
which
we
may
procure
by
sometimes
aiming
directly
at
the
happiness
of
other
persons
may
be
greater
than
any
we
could
otherwise
get
egoism
in
this
sense
must
therefore
be
carefully
distinguished
from
egoism
in
another
sense
the
sense
in
which
altruism
is
its
proper
opposite
egoism
as
commonly
opposed
to
altruism
is
apt
to
denote
merely
selfishness
in
this
sense
a
man
is
an
egoist
if
all
his
actions
are
actually
directed
towards
gaining
pleasure
for
himself
whether
he
holds
that
he
ought
to
act
so
because
he
will
thereby
obtain
for
himself
the
greatest
possible
happiness
on
the
whole
or
not
egoism
may
accordingly
be
used
to
denote
the
theory
that
we
should
always
aim
at
getting
pleasure
for
ourselves
because
that
is
the
best
to
the
ultimate
end
whether
the
ultimate
end
be
our
own
greatest
pleasure
or
not
altruism
on
the
other
hand
may
denote
the
theory
that
we
ought
always
to
aim
at
other
people
s
happiness
on
the
ground
that
this
is
the
best
of
securing
our
own
as
well
as
theirs
accordingly
an
egoist
in
the
sense
in
which
i
am
now
going
to
talk
of
egoism
an
egoist
who
holds
that
his
own
greatest
happiness
is
the
ultimate
end
may
at
the
same
time
be
an
altruist
he
may
hold
that
he
ought
to
love
his
neighbour
as
the
best
means
to
being
happy
himself
and
conversely
an
egoist
in
the
other
sense
may
at
the
same
time
be
a
utilitarian
he
may
hold
that
he
ought
always
to
direct
his
efforts
towards
getting
pleasure
for
himself
on
the
ground
that
he
is
thereby
most
likely
to
increase
the
general
sum
of
happiness
i
shall
say
more
later
about
this
second
kind
of
egoism
this
egoism
this
egoism
as
a
doctrine
of
means
what
i
am
now
concerned
with
is
that
utterly
distinct
kind
of
egoism
which
holds
that
each
man
ought
rationally
to
hold
my
own
greatest
happiness
is
the
only
good
thing
there
is
my
actions
can
only
be
good
as
means
in
so
far
as
they
help
to
win
me
this
this
is
a
doctrine
which
is
not
much
held
by
writers
it
is
a
doctrine
that
was
largely
held
by
english
hedonists
in
the
and
centuries
it
is
for
example
at
the
bottom
of
hobbes
ethics
but
even
the
english
school
appear
to
have
made
one
step
forward
in
the
present
century
they
are
most
of
them
utilitarians
they
do
recognise
that
if
my
own
happiness
is
good
it
would
be
strange
that
other
people
s
happiness
should
not
be
good
too
in
order
fully
to
expose
the
absurdity
of
this
kind
of
egoism
it
is
necessary
to
examine
certain
confusions
upon
which
its
plausibility
depends
the
chief
of
these
is
the
confusion
involved
in
the
conception
of
my
own
good
as
distinguished
from
the
good
of
this
is
a
conception
which
we
all
use
every
day
it
is
one
of
the
first
to
which
the
plain
man
is
apt
to
appeal
in
discussing
any
question
of
ethics
and
egoism
is
commonly
advocated
chiefly
because
its
meaning
is
not
clearly
perceived
it
is
plain
indeed
that
the
name
egoism
more
properly
applies
to
the
theory
that
my
own
good
is
the
sole
good
than
that
my
own
pleasure
is
so
a
man
may
quite
well
be
an
egoist
even
if
he
be
not
a
hedonist
the
conception
which
is
perhaps
most
closely
associated
with
egoism
is
that
denoted
by
the
words
my
own
the
egoist
is
the
man
who
holds
that
a
tendency
to
promote
his
own
interest
is
the
sole
possible
and
sufficient
justification
of
all
his
actions
but
this
conception
of
my
own
interest
plainly
includes
in
general
very
much
more
than
my
own
pleasure
it
is
indeed
only
because
and
in
so
far
as
my
own
interest
has
been
thought
to
consist
solely
in
my
own
pleasure
that
egoists
have
been
led
to
hold
that
my
own
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
their
course
of
reasoning
is
as
follows
the
only
thing
i
ought
to
secure
is
my
own
interest
but
my
own
interest
consists
in
my
greatest
possible
pleasure
and
therefore
the
only
thing
i
ought
to
pursue
is
my
own
pleasure
that
it
is
very
natural
thus
to
identify
my
own
pleasure
with
my
own
interest
and
that
it
has
been
generally
done
by
modern
may
be
admitted
but
when
sidgwick
points
this
out
iii
xiv
div
iii
he
should
have
also
pointed
out
that
this
identification
has
by
no
means
been
made
in
ordinary
thought
when
the
plain
man
says
my
own
interest
he
does
mean
my
own
pleasure
he
does
not
commonly
even
include
this
he
means
my
own
advancement
my
own
reputation
the
getting
of
a
better
income
etc
that
sidgwick
should
not
have
noticed
this
and
that
he
should
give
the
reason
he
gives
for
the
fact
that
the
ancient
did
not
identify
my
own
interest
with
my
own
pleasure
seems
to
be
due
to
his
having
failed
to
notice
that
very
confusion
in
the
conception
of
my
own
good
which
i
am
now
to
point
out
that
confusion
has
perhaps
been
more
clearly
perceived
by
plato
than
by
any
other
moralist
and
to
point
it
out
suffices
to
refute
sidgwick
s
own
view
that
egoism
is
rational
what
then
is
meant
by
my
own
good
in
what
sense
can
a
thing
be
good
it
is
obvious
if
we
reflect
that
the
only
thing
which
can
belong
to
me
which
can
be
is
something
which
is
good
and
not
the
fact
that
it
is
good
when
therefore
i
talk
of
anything
i
get
as
my
own
good
i
must
mean
either
that
the
thing
i
get
is
good
or
that
my
possessing
it
is
good
in
both
cases
it
is
only
the
thing
or
the
possession
of
it
which
is
and
not
of
that
thing
or
that
possession
there
is
no
longer
any
meaning
in
attaching
the
my
to
our
predicate
and
saying
the
possession
of
this
is
good
even
if
we
interpret
this
by
my
possession
of
this
is
what
think
good
the
same
still
holds
for
i
think
is
that
my
possession
of
it
is
good
and
if
i
think
rightly
then
the
truth
is
that
my
possession
of
it
good
simply
not
in
any
sense
good
and
if
i
think
wrongly
it
is
not
good
at
all
in
short
when
i
talk
of
a
thing
as
my
own
good
all
that
i
can
mean
is
that
something
which
will
be
exclusively
mine
as
my
own
pleasure
is
mine
whatever
be
the
various
senses
of
this
relation
denoted
by
possession
is
also
or
rather
that
my
possession
of
it
is
the
of
it
can
in
no
possible
sense
be
private
or
belong
to
me
any
more
than
a
thing
can
privately
or
one
person
only
the
only
reason
i
can
have
for
aiming
at
my
own
good
is
that
it
is
that
what
i
so
call
should
belong
to
me
that
i
should
something
which
if
i
have
it
others
can
not
have
but
if
it
is
that
i
should
have
it
then
everyone
else
has
as
much
reason
for
aiming
at
having
it
as
i
have
myself
if
therefore
it
is
true
of
single
man
s
interest
or
happiness
that
it
ought
to
be
his
sole
ultimate
end
this
can
only
mean
that
man
s
interest
or
happiness
is
sole
good
universal
good
and
the
only
thing
that
anybody
ought
to
aim
at
what
egoism
holds
therefore
is
that
man
s
happiness
is
the
sole
good
that
a
number
of
different
things
are
of
them
the
only
good
thing
there
is
an
absolute
contradiction
no
more
complete
and
thorough
refutation
of
any
theory
could
be
desired
yet
sidgwick
holds
that
egoism
is
rational
and
it
will
be
useful
briefly
to
consider
the
reasons
which
he
gives
for
this
absurd
conclusion
the
egoist
he
says
last
chap
may
avoid
the
proof
of
utilitarianism
by
declining
to
affirm
either
implicitly
or
explicitly
that
his
own
greatest
happiness
is
not
merely
the
ultimate
rational
end
for
himself
but
a
part
of
universal
and
in
the
passage
to
which
he
here
refers
us
as
having
there
seen
this
he
says
it
can
not
be
proved
that
the
difference
between
his
own
happiness
and
another
s
happiness
is
not
iv
ii
what
does
sidgwick
mean
by
these
phrases
the
ultimate
rational
end
for
himself
and
he
does
not
attempt
to
define
them
and
it
is
largely
the
use
of
such
undefined
phrases
which
causes
absurdities
to
be
committed
in
philosophy
is
there
any
sense
in
which
a
thing
can
be
an
ultimate
rational
end
for
one
person
and
not
for
another
by
ultimate
must
be
meant
at
least
that
the
end
is
good
in
our
undefinable
sense
and
by
rational
at
least
that
it
is
truly
good
that
a
thing
should
be
an
ultimate
rational
end
means
then
that
it
is
truly
good
in
itself
and
that
it
is
truly
good
in
itself
means
that
it
is
a
part
of
universal
good
can
we
assign
any
meaning
to
that
qualification
for
himself
which
will
make
it
cease
to
be
a
part
of
universal
good
the
thing
is
impossible
for
the
egoist
s
happiness
must
be
good
in
itself
and
so
a
part
of
universal
good
it
can
not
be
good
in
itself
at
all
there
is
no
escaping
this
dilemma
and
if
it
is
not
good
at
all
what
reason
can
he
have
for
aiming
at
it
how
can
it
be
a
rational
end
for
him
that
qualification
for
himself
has
no
meaning
unless
it
implies
for
others
and
if
it
implies
not
for
others
then
it
can
not
be
a
rational
end
for
him
since
it
can
not
be
truly
good
in
itself
the
phrase
an
ultimate
rational
end
for
himself
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
by
saying
that
a
thing
is
an
end
for
one
particular
person
or
good
for
him
can
only
be
meant
one
of
four
things
either
it
may
be
meant
that
the
end
in
question
is
something
which
will
belong
exclusively
to
him
but
in
that
case
if
it
is
to
be
rational
for
him
to
aim
at
it
that
he
should
exclusively
possess
it
must
be
a
part
of
universal
good
or
it
may
be
meant
that
it
is
the
only
thing
at
which
he
ought
to
aim
but
this
can
only
be
because
by
so
doing
he
will
do
the
most
he
can
towards
realising
universal
good
and
this
in
our
case
will
only
give
egoism
as
a
doctrine
of
or
it
may
be
meant
that
the
thing
is
what
he
desires
or
thinks
good
and
then
if
he
thinks
wrongly
it
is
not
a
rational
end
at
all
and
if
he
thinks
rightly
it
is
a
part
of
universal
good
or
it
may
be
meant
that
it
is
peculiarly
appropriate
that
a
thing
which
will
belong
exclusively
to
him
should
also
by
him
be
approved
or
aimed
at
but
in
this
case
both
that
it
should
belong
to
him
and
that
he
should
aim
at
it
must
be
parts
of
universal
good
by
saying
that
a
certain
relation
between
two
things
is
fitting
or
appropriate
we
can
only
mean
that
the
existence
of
that
relation
is
absolutely
good
in
itself
unless
it
be
so
as
a
means
which
gives
case
by
no
possible
meaning
then
that
can
be
given
to
the
phrase
that
his
own
happiness
is
the
ultimate
rational
end
for
himself
can
the
egoist
escape
the
implication
that
his
own
happiness
is
absolutely
good
and
by
saying
that
it
is
ultimate
rational
end
he
must
mean
that
it
is
the
only
good
thing
the
whole
of
universal
good
and
if
he
further
maintains
that
each
man
s
happiness
is
the
ultimate
rational
end
for
we
have
the
fundamental
contradiction
of
egoism
that
an
immense
number
of
different
things
are
of
them
sole
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
same
considerations
apply
to
the
phrase
that
the
difference
between
his
own
happiness
and
another
s
is
this
can
only
mean
either
that
his
own
happiness
is
the
only
end
which
will
affect
him
or
that
the
only
important
thing
for
him
as
a
means
is
to
look
to
his
own
happiness
or
that
it
is
only
his
own
happiness
which
he
cares
about
or
that
it
is
good
that
each
man
s
happiness
should
be
the
only
concern
of
that
man
and
none
of
these
propositions
true
as
they
may
be
have
the
smallest
tendency
to
shew
that
if
his
own
happiness
is
desirable
at
all
it
is
not
a
part
of
universal
good
either
his
own
happiness
is
a
good
thing
or
it
is
not
and
in
whatever
sense
it
may
be
for
him
it
must
be
true
that
if
it
is
not
good
he
is
not
justified
in
pursuing
it
and
that
if
it
is
good
everyone
else
has
an
equal
reason
to
pursue
it
so
far
as
they
are
able
and
so
far
as
it
does
not
exclude
their
attainment
of
other
more
valuable
parts
of
universal
good
in
short
it
is
plain
that
the
addition
of
for
him
for
me
to
such
words
as
ultimate
rational
end
good
important
can
introduce
nothing
but
confusion
the
only
possible
reason
that
can
justify
any
action
is
that
by
it
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
what
is
good
absolutely
should
be
realised
and
if
anyone
says
that
the
attainment
of
his
own
happiness
justifies
his
actions
he
must
mean
that
this
is
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
universal
good
which
he
can
realise
and
this
again
can
only
be
true
either
because
has
no
power
to
realise
more
in
which
case
he
only
holds
egoism
as
a
doctrine
of
means
or
else
because
his
own
happiness
is
the
greatest
amount
of
universal
good
which
can
be
realised
at
all
in
which
case
we
have
egoism
proper
and
the
flagrant
contradiction
that
every
person
s
happiness
is
singly
the
greatest
amount
of
universal
good
which
can
be
realised
at
all
it
should
be
observed
that
since
this
is
so
the
relation
of
rational
egoism
to
rational
benevolence
which
sidgwick
regards
as
the
profoundest
problem
of
ethics
iii
xiii
appears
in
quite
a
different
light
to
that
in
which
he
presents
it
even
if
a
man
he
says
admits
the
of
the
principle
of
rational
benevolence
he
may
still
hold
that
his
own
happiness
is
an
end
which
it
is
irrational
for
him
to
sacrifice
to
any
other
and
that
therefore
a
harmony
between
the
maxim
of
prudence
and
the
maxim
of
rational
benevolence
must
be
somehow
demonstrated
if
morality
is
to
be
made
completely
rational
this
latter
view
is
that
which
i
myself
hold
last
chap
sidgwick
then
goes
on
to
shew
that
the
inseparable
connection
between
utilitarian
duty
and
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
individual
who
conforms
to
it
can
not
be
satisfactorily
demonstrated
on
empirical
grounds
ib
and
the
final
paragraph
of
his
book
tells
us
that
since
the
reconciliation
of
duty
and
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
hypothesis
logically
necessary
to
avoid
a
fundamental
in
one
chief
department
of
our
thought
it
remains
to
ask
how
far
this
necessity
constitutes
a
sufficient
reason
for
accepting
this
hypothesis
ib
to
assume
the
existence
of
such
a
being
as
god
by
the
of
theologians
is
conceived
to
be
would
he
has
already
argued
ensure
the
required
reconciliation
since
the
divine
sanctions
of
such
a
god
would
of
course
suffice
to
make
it
always
every
one
s
interest
to
promote
universal
happiness
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
ib
the
italics
are
mine
now
what
is
this
reconciliation
of
duty
and
which
divine
sanctions
could
ensure
it
would
consist
in
the
mere
fact
that
the
same
conduct
which
produced
the
greatest
possible
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
would
always
also
produce
the
greatest
possible
happiness
of
the
agent
if
this
were
the
case
and
our
empirical
knowledge
shews
that
it
is
not
the
case
in
this
world
morality
would
sidgwick
thinks
be
completely
rational
we
should
avoid
an
ultimate
and
fundamental
contradiction
in
our
apparent
intuitions
of
what
is
reasonable
in
that
is
to
say
we
should
avoid
the
necessity
of
thinking
that
it
is
as
manifest
an
obligation
to
secure
our
own
greatest
happiness
maxim
of
prudence
as
to
secure
the
greatest
happiness
on
the
whole
maxim
of
benevolence
but
it
is
perfectly
obvious
we
should
not
sidgwick
here
commits
the
characteristic
fallacy
of
empiricism
the
fallacy
of
thinking
that
an
alteration
in
could
make
a
contradiction
cease
to
be
a
contradiction
that
a
single
man
s
happiness
should
be
sole
and
that
also
everybody
s
happiness
should
be
sole
is
a
contradiction
which
can
not
be
solved
by
the
assumption
that
the
same
conduct
will
secure
both
it
would
be
equally
contradictory
however
certain
we
were
that
that
assumption
was
justified
sidgwick
strains
at
a
gnat
and
swallows
a
camel
he
thinks
the
divine
omnipotence
must
be
called
into
play
to
secure
that
what
gives
other
people
pleasure
should
also
give
it
to
him
that
only
so
can
ethics
be
made
rational
while
he
overlooks
the
fact
that
even
this
exercise
of
divine
omnipotence
would
leave
in
ethics
a
contradiction
in
comparison
with
which
his
difficulty
is
a
trifle
a
contradiction
which
would
reduce
all
ethics
to
mere
nonsense
and
before
which
the
divine
omnipotence
must
be
powerless
to
all
eternity
that
man
s
happiness
should
be
the
which
we
have
seen
to
be
the
principle
of
egoism
is
in
itself
a
contradiction
and
that
it
should
also
be
true
that
the
happiness
of
all
is
the
which
is
the
principle
of
universalistic
hedonism
would
introduce
another
contradiction
and
that
these
propositions
should
all
be
true
might
well
be
called
the
profoundest
problem
in
ethics
it
would
be
a
problem
necessarily
insoluble
but
they
all
be
true
and
there
is
no
reason
but
confusion
for
the
supposition
that
they
are
sidgwick
confuses
this
contradiction
with
the
mere
fact
in
which
there
is
no
contradiction
that
our
own
greatest
happiness
and
that
of
all
do
not
seem
always
attainable
by
the
same
means
this
fact
if
happiness
were
the
sole
good
would
indeed
be
of
some
importance
and
on
any
view
similar
facts
are
of
importance
but
they
are
nothing
but
instances
of
the
one
important
fact
that
in
this
world
the
quantity
of
good
which
is
attainable
is
ridiculously
small
compared
to
that
which
is
imaginable
that
i
can
not
get
the
most
possible
pleasure
for
myself
if
i
produce
the
most
possible
pleasure
on
the
whole
is
no
more
profoundest
problem
of
ethics
than
that
in
any
case
i
can
not
get
as
much
pleasure
altogether
as
would
be
desirable
it
only
states
that
if
we
get
as
much
good
as
possible
in
one
place
we
may
get
less
on
the
whole
because
the
quantity
of
attainable
good
is
limited
to
say
that
i
have
to
choose
between
my
own
good
and
that
of
is
a
false
antithesis
the
only
rational
question
is
how
to
choose
between
my
own
and
that
of
and
the
principle
on
which
this
must
be
answered
is
exactly
the
same
as
that
on
which
i
must
choose
whether
to
give
pleasure
to
this
other
person
or
to
that
it
is
plain
then
that
the
doctrine
of
egoism
is
and
that
one
reason
why
this
is
not
perceived
is
a
confusion
with
regard
to
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
my
own
and
it
may
be
observed
that
this
confusion
and
the
neglect
of
this
contradiction
are
necessarily
involved
in
the
transition
from
naturalistic
hedonism
as
ordinarily
held
to
utilitarianism
mill
for
instance
as
we
saw
declares
each
person
so
far
as
he
believes
it
to
be
attainable
desires
his
own
happiness
and
he
offers
this
as
a
reason
why
the
general
happiness
is
desirable
we
have
seen
that
to
regard
it
as
such
involves
in
the
first
place
the
naturalistic
fallacy
but
moreover
even
if
that
fallacy
were
not
a
fallacy
it
could
only
be
a
reason
for
egoism
and
not
for
utilitarianism
mill
s
argument
is
as
follows
a
man
desires
his
own
happiness
therefore
his
own
happiness
is
desirable
further
a
man
desires
nothing
but
his
own
happiness
therefore
his
own
happiness
is
alone
desirable
we
have
next
to
remember
that
everybody
according
to
mill
so
desires
his
own
happiness
and
then
it
will
follow
that
everybody
s
happiness
is
alone
desirable
and
this
is
simply
a
contradiction
in
terms
just
consider
what
it
means
each
man
s
happiness
is
the
only
thing
desirable
several
different
things
are
of
them
the
thing
desirable
this
is
the
fundamental
contradiction
of
egoism
in
order
to
think
that
what
his
arguments
tend
to
prove
is
not
egoism
but
utilitarianism
mill
must
think
that
he
can
infer
from
the
proposition
each
man
s
happiness
is
his
own
good
the
proposition
the
happiness
of
all
is
the
good
of
all
whereas
in
fact
if
we
understand
what
his
own
good
means
it
is
plain
that
the
latter
can
only
be
inferred
from
the
happiness
of
all
is
the
good
of
naturalistic
hedonism
then
logically
leads
only
to
egoism
of
course
a
naturalist
might
hold
that
what
we
aimed
at
was
simply
pleasure
not
our
own
pleasure
and
always
assuming
the
naturalistic
fallacy
would
give
an
unobjectionable
ground
for
utilitarianism
but
more
commonly
he
will
hold
that
it
is
his
own
pleasure
he
desires
or
at
least
will
confuse
this
with
the
other
and
then
he
must
logically
be
led
to
adopt
egoism
and
not
utilitarianism
the
second
cause
i
have
to
give
why
egoism
should
be
thought
reasonable
is
simply
its
confusion
with
that
other
kind
of
egoism
egoism
as
a
doctrine
of
means
this
second
egoism
has
a
right
to
say
you
ought
to
pursue
your
own
happiness
sometimes
at
all
events
it
may
even
say
always
and
when
we
find
it
saying
this
we
are
apt
to
forget
its
proviso
but
only
as
a
means
to
something
else
the
fact
is
we
are
in
an
imperfect
state
we
can
not
get
the
ideal
all
at
once
and
hence
it
is
often
our
bounden
duty
we
often
to
do
things
which
are
good
only
or
chiefly
as
means
we
have
to
do
the
best
we
can
what
is
absolutely
right
but
not
what
is
absolutely
good
of
this
i
shall
say
more
hereafter
i
only
mention
it
here
because
i
think
it
is
much
more
plausible
to
say
that
we
ought
to
pursue
our
own
pleasure
as
a
means
than
as
an
end
and
that
this
doctrine
through
confusion
lends
some
of
its
plausibility
to
the
utterly
different
doctrine
of
egoism
proper
my
own
greatest
pleasure
is
the
only
good
thing
so
much
for
egoism
of
utilitarianism
not
much
need
be
said
but
two
points
may
seem
deserving
of
notice
the
first
is
that
this
name
like
that
of
egoism
does
not
naturally
suggest
that
all
our
actions
are
to
be
judged
according
to
the
degree
in
which
they
are
a
means
to
its
natural
meaning
is
that
the
standard
of
right
and
wrong
in
conduct
is
its
tendency
to
promote
the
of
everybody
and
by
is
commonly
meant
a
variety
of
different
goods
classed
together
only
because
they
are
what
a
man
commonly
desires
for
himself
so
far
as
his
desires
have
not
that
psychological
quality
which
is
meant
by
the
useful
thus
means
and
was
in
ancient
ethics
systematically
used
to
mean
what
is
a
means
to
the
attainment
of
goods
other
than
moral
goods
it
is
quite
an
unjustifiable
assumption
that
these
goods
are
only
good
as
means
to
pleasure
or
that
they
are
commonly
so
regarded
the
chief
reason
for
adopting
the
name
utilitarianism
was
indeed
merely
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
right
and
wrong
conduct
must
be
judged
by
its
results
as
a
means
in
opposition
to
the
strictly
intuitionistic
view
that
certain
ways
of
acting
were
right
and
others
wrong
whatever
their
results
might
be
in
thus
insisting
that
what
is
right
must
mean
what
produces
the
best
possible
results
utilitarianism
is
fully
justified
but
with
this
correct
contention
there
has
been
historically
and
very
naturally
associated
a
double
error
the
best
possible
results
were
assumed
to
consist
only
in
a
limited
class
of
goods
roughly
coinciding
with
those
which
were
popularly
distinguished
as
the
results
of
merely
useful
or
interested
actions
and
these
again
were
hastily
assumed
to
be
good
only
as
means
to
pleasure
the
utilitarians
tend
to
regard
everything
as
a
mere
means
neglecting
the
fact
that
some
things
which
are
good
as
means
are
also
good
as
ends
thus
for
instance
assuming
pleasure
to
be
a
good
there
is
a
tendency
to
value
present
pleasure
only
as
a
means
to
future
pleasure
and
not
as
is
strictly
necessary
if
pleasure
is
good
as
an
end
also
to
it
possible
future
pleasures
much
utilitarian
argument
involves
the
logical
absurdity
that
what
is
here
and
now
never
has
any
value
in
itself
but
is
only
to
be
judged
by
its
consequences
which
again
of
course
when
they
are
realised
would
have
no
value
in
themselves
but
would
be
mere
means
to
a
still
further
future
and
so
on
the
second
point
deserving
notice
with
regard
to
utilitarianism
is
that
when
the
name
is
used
for
a
form
of
hedonism
it
does
not
commonly
even
in
its
description
of
its
accurately
distinguish
between
means
and
end
its
formula
is
that
the
result
by
which
actions
are
to
be
judged
is
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
but
it
is
plain
that
if
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
provided
the
quantity
be
equally
great
an
equally
desirable
result
will
have
been
obtained
whether
it
be
enjoyed
by
many
or
by
few
or
even
if
it
be
enjoyed
by
nobody
it
is
plain
that
if
we
ought
to
aim
at
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
this
can
only
on
the
hedonistic
principle
be
because
the
existence
of
pleasure
in
a
great
number
of
persons
seems
to
be
the
best
available
for
attaining
the
existence
of
the
greatest
quantity
of
pleasure
this
may
actually
be
the
case
but
it
is
fair
to
suspect
that
utilitarians
have
been
influenced
in
their
adoption
of
the
hedonistic
principle
by
this
failure
to
distinguish
clearly
between
pleasure
or
consciousness
of
pleasure
and
its
possession
by
a
person
it
is
far
easier
to
regard
the
possession
of
pleasure
by
a
number
of
persons
as
the
sole
good
than
so
to
regard
the
mere
existence
of
an
equally
great
quantity
of
pleasure
if
indeed
we
were
to
take
the
utilitarian
principle
strictly
and
to
assume
them
to
mean
that
the
possession
of
pleasure
by
many
persons
was
good
in
itself
the
principle
is
not
hedonistic
it
includes
as
a
necessary
part
of
the
ultimate
end
the
existence
of
a
number
of
persons
and
this
will
include
very
much
more
than
mere
pleasure
utilitarianism
however
as
commonly
held
must
be
understood
to
maintain
that
either
mere
consciousness
of
pleasure
or
consciousness
of
pleasure
together
with
the
minimum
adjunct
which
may
be
meant
by
the
existence
of
such
consciousness
in
at
least
one
is
the
this
is
its
significance
as
an
ethical
doctrine
and
as
such
it
has
already
been
refuted
in
my
refutation
of
hedonism
the
most
that
can
be
said
for
it
is
that
it
does
not
seriously
mislead
in
its
practical
conclusions
on
the
ground
that
as
an
empirical
fact
the
method
of
acting
which
brings
most
good
on
the
whole
does
also
bring
most
pleasure
utilitarians
do
indeed
generally
devote
most
of
their
arguments
to
shewing
that
the
course
of
action
which
will
bring
most
pleasure
is
in
general
such
as
common
sense
would
approve
we
have
seen
that
sidgwick
appeals
to
this
fact
as
tending
to
shew
that
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
and
we
have
also
seen
that
it
does
not
tend
to
shew
this
we
have
seen
how
very
flimsy
the
other
arguments
advanced
for
this
proposition
are
and
that
if
it
be
fairly
considered
by
itself
it
appears
to
be
quite
ridiculous
and
moreover
that
the
actions
which
produce
most
good
on
the
whole
do
also
produce
most
pleasure
is
extremely
doubtful
the
arguments
tending
to
shew
it
are
all
more
or
less
vitiated
by
the
assumption
that
what
appear
to
be
necessary
conditions
for
the
attainment
of
most
pleasure
in
the
near
future
will
always
continue
so
to
be
and
even
with
this
vicious
assumption
they
only
succeed
in
making
out
a
highly
problematical
case
how
therefore
this
fact
is
to
be
explained
if
it
be
a
fact
need
not
concern
us
it
is
sufficient
to
have
shewn
that
many
complex
states
of
mind
are
much
more
valuable
than
the
pleasure
they
contain
if
this
be
so
form
of
hedonism
can
be
and
since
the
practical
guidance
afforded
by
pleasure
as
a
is
small
in
proportion
as
the
calculation
attempts
to
be
accurate
we
can
well
afford
to
await
further
investigation
before
adopting
a
guide
whose
utility
is
very
doubtful
and
whose
trustworthiness
we
have
grave
reason
to
suspect
the
most
important
points
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
establish
in
this
chapter
are
as
follows
hedonism
must
be
strictly
defined
as
the
doctrine
that
pleasure
is
the
only
thing
which
is
good
in
itself
this
view
seems
to
owe
its
prevalence
mainly
to
the
naturalistic
fallacy
and
mill
s
arguments
may
be
taken
as
a
type
of
those
which
are
fallacious
in
this
respect
sidgwick
alone
has
defended
it
without
committing
this
fallacy
and
its
final
refutation
must
therefore
point
out
the
errors
in
his
arguments
mill
s
utilitarianism
is
criticised
it
being
shewn
that
he
commits
the
naturalistic
fallacy
in
identifying
desirable
with
desired
that
pleasure
is
not
the
only
object
of
desire
the
common
arguments
for
hedonism
seem
to
rest
on
these
two
errors
hedonism
is
considered
as
an
intuition
and
it
is
pointed
out
that
mill
s
allowance
that
some
pleasures
are
inferior
in
quality
to
others
implies
both
that
it
is
an
intuition
and
that
it
is
a
false
one
that
sidgwick
fails
to
distinguish
pleasure
from
consciousness
of
pleasure
and
that
it
is
absurd
to
regard
the
former
at
all
events
as
the
sole
good
that
it
seems
equally
absurd
to
regard
consciousness
of
pleasure
as
the
sole
good
since
if
it
were
so
a
world
in
which
nothing
else
existed
might
be
absolutely
perfect
sidgwick
fails
to
put
to
himself
this
question
which
is
the
only
clear
and
decisive
one
what
are
commonly
considered
to
be
the
two
main
types
of
hedonism
namely
egoism
and
utilitarianism
are
not
only
different
from
but
strictly
contradictory
of
one
another
since
the
former
asserts
my
own
greatest
pleasure
is
the
good
the
latter
the
greatest
pleasure
of
all
is
the
egoism
seems
to
owe
its
plausibility
partly
to
the
failure
to
observe
this
contradiction
a
failure
which
is
exemplified
by
sidgwick
partly
to
a
confusion
of
egoism
as
doctrine
of
end
with
the
same
as
doctrine
of
means
if
hedonism
is
true
egoism
can
not
be
so
still
less
can
it
be
so
if
hedonism
is
false
the
end
of
utilitarianism
on
the
other
hand
would
if
hedonism
were
true
be
not
indeed
the
best
conceivable
but
the
best
possible
for
us
to
promote
but
it
is
refuted
by
the
refutation
of
hedonism
chapter
iv
metaphysical
ethics
in
this
chapter
i
propose
to
deal
with
a
type
of
ethical
theory
which
is
exemplified
in
the
ethical
views
of
the
stoics
of
spinoza
of
kant
and
especially
of
a
number
of
modern
writers
whose
views
in
this
respect
are
mainly
due
to
the
influence
of
hegel
these
ethical
theories
have
this
in
common
that
they
use
some
proposition
as
a
ground
for
inferring
some
fundamental
proposition
of
ethics
they
all
imply
and
many
of
them
expressly
hold
that
ethical
truths
follow
logically
from
metaphysical
truths
that
ethics
should
be
based
on
and
the
result
is
that
they
all
describe
the
supreme
good
in
terms
what
then
is
to
be
understood
by
metaphysical
i
use
the
term
as
i
explained
in
chapter
in
opposition
to
i
call
those
philosophers
preeminently
metaphysical
who
have
recognised
most
clearly
that
not
everything
which
is
a
natural
metaphysicians
have
therefore
the
great
merit
of
insisting
that
our
knowledge
is
not
confined
to
the
things
which
we
can
touch
and
see
and
feel
they
have
always
been
much
occupied
not
only
with
that
other
class
of
natural
objects
which
consists
in
mental
facts
but
also
with
the
class
of
objects
or
properties
of
objects
which
certainly
do
not
exist
in
time
are
not
therefore
parts
of
nature
and
which
in
fact
do
not
exist
at
all
to
this
class
as
i
have
said
belongs
what
we
mean
by
the
adjective
it
is
not
but
only
the
things
or
qualities
which
are
good
which
can
exist
in
time
can
have
duration
and
begin
and
cease
to
exist
can
be
objects
of
but
the
most
prominent
members
of
this
class
are
perhaps
numbers
it
is
quite
certain
that
two
natural
objects
may
exist
but
it
is
equally
certain
that
itself
does
not
exist
and
never
can
two
and
two
four
but
that
does
not
mean
that
either
two
or
four
exists
yet
it
certainly
means
two
somehow
although
it
does
not
exist
and
it
is
not
only
simple
terms
of
propositions
the
objects
which
we
know
truths
that
belong
to
this
class
the
truths
which
we
know
about
them
form
perhaps
a
still
more
important
subdivision
no
truth
does
in
fact
but
this
is
peculiarly
obvious
with
regard
to
truths
like
two
and
two
are
four
in
which
the
objects
which
they
are
truths
do
not
exist
either
it
is
with
the
recognition
of
such
truths
as
these
truths
which
have
been
called
universal
and
of
their
essential
unlikeness
to
what
we
can
touch
and
see
and
feel
that
metaphysics
proper
begins
such
universal
truths
have
always
played
a
large
part
in
the
reasonings
of
metaphysicians
from
plato
s
time
till
now
and
that
they
have
directed
attention
to
the
difference
between
these
truths
and
what
i
have
called
natural
objects
is
the
chief
contribution
to
knowledge
which
distinguishes
them
from
that
other
class
of
philosophers
empirical
philosophers
to
which
most
englishmen
have
belonged
but
though
if
we
are
to
define
metaphysics
by
the
contribution
which
it
has
actually
made
to
knowledge
we
should
have
to
say
that
it
has
emphasized
the
importance
of
objects
which
do
not
exist
at
all
metaphysicians
themselves
have
not
recognised
this
they
have
indeed
recognised
and
insisted
that
there
are
or
may
be
objects
of
knowledge
which
do
not
in
or
at
least
which
we
can
not
perceive
and
in
recognising
the
of
these
as
an
object
of
investigation
they
have
it
may
be
admitted
done
a
service
to
mankind
but
they
have
in
general
supposed
that
whatever
does
not
exist
in
time
must
at
least
elsewhere
if
it
is
to
at
all
that
whatever
does
not
exist
in
nature
must
exist
in
some
supersensible
reality
whether
timeless
or
not
consequently
they
have
held
that
the
truths
with
which
they
have
been
occupied
over
and
above
the
objects
of
perception
were
in
some
way
truths
about
such
supersensible
reality
if
therefore
we
are
to
define
metaphysics
not
by
what
it
has
attained
but
by
what
it
has
attempted
we
should
say
that
it
consists
in
the
attempt
to
obtain
knowledge
by
processes
of
reasoning
of
what
exists
but
is
a
part
of
nature
metaphysicians
have
actually
held
that
they
could
give
us
such
knowledge
of
existence
they
have
held
that
their
science
consists
in
giving
us
such
knowledge
as
can
be
supported
by
reasons
of
that
supersensible
reality
of
which
religion
professes
to
give
us
a
fuller
knowledge
without
any
reasons
when
therefore
i
spoke
above
of
metaphysical
propositions
i
meant
propositions
about
the
existence
of
something
supersensible
of
something
which
is
not
an
object
of
perception
and
which
can
not
be
inferred
from
what
is
an
object
of
perception
by
the
same
rules
of
inference
by
which
we
infer
the
past
and
future
of
what
we
call
and
when
i
spoke
of
metaphysical
terms
i
meant
terms
which
refer
to
qualities
of
such
a
supersensible
reality
which
do
not
belong
to
anything
i
admit
that
metaphysics
should
investigate
what
reasons
there
may
be
for
belief
in
such
a
supersensible
reality
since
i
hold
that
its
peculiar
province
is
the
truth
about
all
objects
which
are
not
natural
objects
and
i
think
that
the
most
prominent
characteristic
of
metaphysics
in
history
has
been
its
profession
to
the
truth
about
i
define
metaphysical
therefore
by
a
reference
to
supersensible
although
i
think
that
the
only
objects
about
which
it
has
in
obtaining
truth
are
objects
which
do
not
exist
at
all
so
much
i
hope
will
suffice
to
explain
what
i
mean
by
the
term
metaphysical
and
to
shew
that
it
refers
to
a
clear
and
important
distinction
it
was
not
necessary
for
my
purpose
to
make
the
definition
exhaustive
or
to
shew
that
it
corresponds
in
essentials
with
established
usage
the
distinction
between
nature
and
a
supersensible
reality
is
very
familiar
and
very
important
and
since
the
metaphysician
endeavours
to
things
with
regard
to
a
supersensible
reality
and
since
he
deals
largely
in
truths
which
are
mere
natural
facts
it
is
plain
that
his
arguments
and
errors
if
any
will
be
of
a
more
subtle
kind
than
those
which
i
have
dealt
with
under
the
name
of
for
these
two
reasons
it
seemed
convenient
to
treat
metaphysical
ethics
by
themselves
i
have
said
that
those
systems
of
ethics
which
i
propose
to
call
metaphysical
are
characterised
by
the
fact
that
they
describe
the
supreme
good
in
metaphysical
terms
and
this
has
now
been
explained
as
meaning
that
they
describe
it
in
terms
of
something
which
they
hold
does
exist
but
does
not
exist
in
nature
in
terms
of
a
supersensible
reality
a
metaphysical
ethics
is
marked
by
the
fact
that
it
makes
the
assertion
that
which
would
be
perfectly
good
is
something
which
exists
but
is
not
natural
that
which
has
some
characteristic
possessed
by
a
supersensible
reality
such
an
assertion
was
made
by
the
stoics
when
they
asserted
that
a
life
in
accordance
with
nature
was
perfect
for
they
did
not
mean
by
nature
what
i
have
so
defined
but
something
supersensible
which
they
inferred
to
exist
and
which
they
held
to
be
perfectly
good
such
an
assertion
again
is
made
by
spinoza
when
he
tells
us
that
we
are
more
or
less
perfect
in
proportion
as
we
are
more
or
less
closely
united
with
absolute
substance
by
the
intellectual
love
of
god
such
an
assertion
is
made
by
kant
when
he
tells
us
that
his
kingdom
of
ends
is
the
ideal
and
such
finally
is
made
by
modern
writers
who
tell
us
that
the
final
and
perfect
end
is
to
realise
our
selves
a
self
different
both
from
the
whole
and
from
any
part
of
that
which
exists
here
and
now
in
nature
now
it
is
plain
that
such
ethical
principles
have
a
merit
not
possessed
by
naturalism
in
recognising
that
for
perfect
goodness
much
more
is
required
than
any
quantity
of
what
exists
here
and
now
or
can
be
inferred
as
likely
to
exist
in
the
future
and
moreover
it
is
quite
possible
that
their
assertions
should
be
true
if
we
only
understand
them
to
assert
that
something
which
is
real
possesses
all
the
characteristics
necessary
for
perfect
goodness
but
this
is
not
all
that
they
assert
they
also
imply
as
i
said
that
this
ethical
proposition
from
some
proposition
which
is
metaphysical
that
the
question
what
is
real
has
some
logical
bearing
upon
the
question
what
is
good
it
was
for
this
reason
that
i
described
metaphysical
ethics
in
chapter
ii
as
based
upon
the
naturalistic
fallacy
to
hold
that
from
any
proposition
asserting
reality
is
of
this
nature
we
can
infer
or
obtain
confirmation
for
any
proposition
asserting
this
is
good
in
itself
is
to
commit
the
naturalistic
fallacy
and
that
a
knowledge
of
what
is
real
supplies
reasons
for
holding
certain
things
to
be
good
in
themselves
is
either
implied
or
expressly
asserted
by
all
those
who
define
the
supreme
good
in
metaphysical
terms
this
contention
is
part
of
what
is
meant
by
saying
that
ethics
should
be
based
on
metaphysics
it
is
meant
that
some
knowledge
of
supersensible
reality
is
necessary
a
for
correct
conclusions
as
to
what
ought
to
exist
this
view
is
for
instance
plainly
expressed
in
the
following
statements
the
truth
is
that
the
theory
of
ethics
which
seems
most
satisfactory
has
a
metaphysical
basis
if
we
rest
our
view
of
ethics
on
the
idea
of
the
development
of
the
ideal
self
or
of
the
rational
universe
the
significance
of
this
can
not
be
made
fully
apparent
without
a
metaphysical
examination
of
the
nature
of
self
can
its
validity
be
established
except
by
a
discussion
of
the
reality
of
the
rational
the
validity
of
an
ethical
conclusion
about
the
nature
of
the
ideal
it
is
here
asserted
can
not
be
established
except
by
considering
the
question
whether
that
ideal
is
such
an
assertion
involves
the
naturalistic
fallacy
it
rests
upon
the
failure
to
perceive
that
any
truth
which
asserts
this
is
good
in
itself
is
quite
unique
in
kind
that
it
can
not
be
reduced
to
any
assertion
about
reality
and
therefore
must
remain
unaffected
by
any
conclusions
we
may
reach
about
the
nature
of
reality
this
confusion
as
to
the
unique
nature
of
ethical
truths
is
i
have
said
involved
in
all
those
ethical
theories
which
i
have
called
metaphysical
it
is
plain
that
but
for
some
confusion
of
the
sort
would
think
it
worth
while
even
to
describe
the
supreme
good
in
metaphysical
terms
if
for
instance
we
are
told
that
the
ideal
consists
in
the
realisation
of
the
true
self
the
very
words
suggest
that
the
fact
that
the
self
in
question
is
is
supposed
to
have
some
bearing
on
the
fact
that
it
is
good
all
the
ethical
truth
which
can
possibly
be
conveyed
by
such
an
assertion
would
be
just
as
well
conveyed
by
saying
that
the
ideal
consisted
in
the
realisation
of
a
particular
kind
of
self
which
might
be
either
real
or
purely
imaginary
metaphysical
ethics
then
involve
the
supposition
that
ethics
can
be
on
metaphysics
and
our
first
concern
with
them
is
to
make
clear
that
this
supposition
must
be
false
mackenzie
manual
of
the
italics
are
mine
in
what
way
can
the
nature
of
supersensible
reality
possibly
have
a
bearing
upon
ethics
i
have
distinguished
two
kinds
of
ethical
questions
which
are
far
too
commonly
confused
with
one
another
ethics
as
commonly
understood
has
to
answer
both
the
question
what
ought
to
be
and
the
question
what
ought
we
to
do
the
second
of
these
questions
can
only
be
answered
by
considering
what
effects
our
actions
will
have
a
complete
answer
to
it
would
give
us
that
department
of
ethics
which
may
be
called
the
doctrine
of
or
practical
ethics
and
upon
this
department
of
ethical
enquiry
it
is
plain
that
the
nature
of
a
supersensible
reality
may
have
a
bearing
if
for
instance
metaphysics
could
tell
us
not
only
that
we
are
immortal
but
also
in
any
degree
what
effects
our
actions
in
this
life
will
have
upon
our
condition
in
a
future
one
such
information
would
have
an
undoubted
bearing
upon
the
question
what
we
ought
to
do
the
christian
doctrines
of
heaven
and
hell
are
in
this
way
highly
relevant
to
practical
ethics
but
it
is
worthy
of
notice
that
the
most
characteristic
doctrines
of
metaphysics
are
such
as
either
have
no
such
bearing
upon
practical
ethics
or
have
a
purely
negative
bearing
involving
the
conclusion
that
there
is
nothing
which
we
ought
to
do
at
all
they
profess
to
tell
us
the
nature
not
of
a
future
reality
but
of
one
that
is
eternal
and
which
therefore
no
actions
of
ours
can
have
power
to
alter
such
information
indeed
have
relevance
to
practical
ethics
but
it
must
be
of
a
purely
negative
kind
for
if
it
holds
not
only
that
such
an
eternal
reality
exists
but
also
as
is
commonly
the
case
that
nothing
else
is
real
that
nothing
either
has
been
is
now
or
will
be
real
in
time
then
truly
it
will
follow
that
nothing
we
can
do
will
ever
bring
any
good
to
pass
for
it
is
certain
that
our
actions
can
only
affect
the
future
and
if
nothing
can
be
real
in
the
future
we
can
certainly
not
hope
ever
to
make
any
good
thing
real
it
would
follow
then
that
there
can
be
nothing
which
we
ought
to
do
we
can
not
possibly
do
any
good
for
neither
our
efforts
nor
any
result
which
they
may
seem
to
effect
have
any
real
existence
but
this
consequence
though
it
follows
strictly
from
many
metaphysical
doctrines
is
rarely
drawn
although
a
metaphysician
may
say
that
nothing
is
real
but
that
which
is
eternal
he
will
generally
allow
that
there
is
some
reality
also
in
the
temporal
and
his
doctrine
of
an
eternal
reality
need
not
interfere
with
practical
ethics
if
he
allows
that
however
good
the
eternal
reality
may
be
yet
some
things
will
also
exist
in
time
and
that
the
existence
of
some
will
be
better
than
that
of
others
it
is
however
worth
while
to
insist
upon
this
point
because
it
is
rarely
fully
realised
if
it
is
maintained
that
there
is
any
validity
at
all
in
practical
ethics
that
any
proposition
which
asserts
we
ought
to
do
so
and
so
can
have
any
truth
this
contention
can
only
be
consistent
with
the
metaphysics
of
an
eternal
reality
under
two
conditions
one
of
these
is
that
the
true
eternal
reality
which
is
to
be
our
guide
can
not
as
is
implied
by
calling
it
true
be
the
true
reality
for
a
moral
rule
bidding
us
realise
a
certain
end
can
only
be
justified
if
it
is
possible
that
that
end
should
at
least
partially
be
realised
unless
our
efforts
can
effect
the
existence
of
some
good
however
little
we
certainly
have
no
reason
for
making
them
and
if
the
eternal
reality
is
the
sole
reality
then
nothing
good
can
possibly
exist
in
time
we
can
only
be
told
to
try
to
bring
into
existence
something
which
we
know
beforehand
can
not
possibly
exist
if
it
is
said
that
what
exists
in
time
can
only
be
a
manifestation
of
the
true
reality
it
must
at
least
be
allowed
that
that
manifestation
is
another
true
reality
a
good
which
we
really
can
cause
to
exist
for
the
production
of
something
quite
unreal
even
if
it
were
possible
can
not
be
a
reasonable
end
of
action
but
if
the
manifestation
of
that
which
eternally
exists
is
real
then
that
which
eternally
exists
is
not
the
sole
reality
and
the
second
condition
which
follows
from
such
a
metaphysical
principle
of
ethics
is
that
the
eternal
reality
can
not
be
perfect
can
not
be
the
sole
good
for
just
as
a
reasonable
rule
of
conduct
requires
that
what
we
are
told
to
realise
should
be
capable
of
being
truly
real
so
it
requires
that
the
realisation
of
this
ideal
shall
be
truly
good
it
is
just
that
which
be
realised
by
our
efforts
the
appearance
of
the
eternal
in
time
or
whatsoever
else
is
allowed
to
be
attainable
which
must
be
truly
good
if
it
is
to
be
worth
our
efforts
that
the
eternal
reality
is
good
will
by
no
means
justify
us
in
aiming
at
its
manifestation
unless
that
manifestation
itself
be
also
good
for
the
manifestation
is
different
from
the
reality
its
difference
is
allowed
when
we
are
told
that
it
can
be
made
to
exist
whereas
the
reality
itself
exists
unalterably
and
the
existence
of
this
manifestation
is
the
only
thing
which
we
can
hope
to
effect
that
also
is
admitted
if
therefore
the
moral
maxim
is
to
be
justified
it
is
the
existence
of
this
manifestation
as
distinguished
from
the
existence
of
its
corresponding
reality
which
must
be
truly
good
the
reality
may
be
good
too
but
to
justify
the
statement
that
we
ought
to
produce
anything
it
must
be
maintained
that
just
that
thing
itself
and
not
something
else
which
may
be
like
it
is
truly
good
if
it
is
not
true
that
the
existence
of
the
manifestation
will
add
something
to
the
sum
of
good
in
the
universe
then
we
have
no
reason
to
aim
at
making
it
exist
and
if
it
is
true
that
it
will
add
something
to
the
sum
of
good
then
the
existence
of
that
which
is
eternal
can
not
be
perfect
by
itself
it
can
not
include
the
whole
of
possible
goods
metaphysics
then
will
have
a
bearing
upon
practical
ethics
upon
the
question
what
we
ought
to
do
if
it
can
tell
us
anything
about
the
future
consequences
of
our
actions
beyond
what
can
be
established
by
ordinary
inductive
reasoning
but
the
most
characteristic
metaphysical
doctrines
those
which
profess
to
tell
us
not
about
the
future
but
about
the
nature
of
an
eternal
reality
can
either
have
no
bearing
upon
this
practical
question
or
else
must
have
a
purely
destructive
bearing
for
it
is
plain
that
what
exists
eternally
can
not
be
affected
by
our
actions
and
only
what
is
affected
by
our
actions
can
have
a
bearing
on
their
value
as
means
but
the
nature
of
an
eternal
reality
either
admits
no
inference
as
to
the
results
of
our
actions
except
in
so
far
as
it
can
give
us
information
about
the
future
and
how
it
can
do
this
is
not
plain
or
else
if
as
is
usual
it
is
maintained
to
be
the
sole
reality
and
the
sole
good
it
shews
that
no
results
of
our
actions
can
have
any
value
whatever
but
this
bearing
upon
practical
ethics
such
as
it
is
is
not
what
is
commonly
meant
when
it
is
maintained
that
ethics
must
be
based
on
metaphysics
it
is
not
the
assertion
of
this
relation
which
i
have
taken
to
be
characteristic
of
metaphysical
ethics
what
metaphysical
writers
commonly
maintain
is
not
merely
that
metaphysics
can
help
us
to
decide
what
the
effects
of
our
actions
will
be
but
that
it
can
tell
us
which
among
possible
effects
will
be
good
and
which
will
be
bad
they
profess
that
metaphysics
is
a
necessary
basis
for
an
answer
to
that
other
and
primary
ethical
question
what
ought
to
be
what
is
good
in
itself
that
no
truth
about
what
is
real
can
have
any
logical
bearing
upon
the
answer
to
this
question
has
been
proved
in
chapter
i
to
suppose
that
it
has
implies
the
naturalistic
fallacy
all
that
remains
for
us
to
do
is
therefore
to
expose
the
main
errors
which
seem
to
have
lent
plausibility
to
this
fallacy
in
its
metaphysical
form
if
we
ask
what
bearing
can
metaphysics
have
upon
the
question
what
is
good
the
only
possible
answer
is
obviously
and
absolutely
none
we
can
only
hope
to
enforce
conviction
that
this
answer
is
the
only
true
one
by
answering
the
question
why
has
it
been
supposed
to
have
such
a
bearing
we
shall
find
that
metaphysical
writers
seem
to
have
failed
to
distinguish
this
primary
ethical
question
what
is
good
from
various
other
questions
and
to
point
out
these
distinctions
will
serve
to
confirm
the
view
that
their
profession
to
base
ethics
on
metaphysics
is
solely
due
to
confusion
and
first
of
all
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
very
question
what
is
good
to
which
it
seems
some
influence
must
be
attributed
the
question
may
mean
either
which
among
existing
things
are
good
or
else
what
things
are
good
what
are
the
things
which
whether
they
real
or
not
ought
to
be
real
and
of
these
two
questions
it
is
plain
that
to
answer
the
first
we
must
know
both
the
answer
to
the
second
and
also
the
answer
to
the
question
what
is
real
it
asks
us
for
a
catalogue
of
all
the
good
things
in
the
universe
and
to
answer
it
we
must
know
both
what
things
there
are
in
the
universe
and
also
which
of
them
are
good
upon
this
question
then
our
metaphysics
would
have
a
bearing
if
it
can
tell
us
what
is
real
it
would
help
us
to
complete
the
list
of
things
which
are
both
real
and
good
but
to
make
such
a
list
is
not
the
business
of
ethics
so
far
as
it
enquires
what
is
good
its
business
is
finished
when
it
has
completed
the
list
of
things
which
ought
to
exist
whether
they
do
exist
or
not
and
if
our
metaphysics
is
to
have
any
bearing
upon
this
part
of
the
ethical
problem
it
must
be
because
the
fact
that
something
is
real
gives
a
reason
for
thinking
that
it
or
something
else
is
good
whether
it
be
real
or
not
that
any
such
fact
can
give
any
such
reason
is
impossible
but
it
may
be
suspected
that
the
contrary
supposition
has
been
encouraged
by
the
failure
to
distinguish
between
the
assertion
this
is
good
when
it
means
sort
of
is
good
or
this
would
be
good
if
it
existed
and
the
assertion
this
existing
thing
is
the
latter
proposition
obviously
can
not
be
true
unless
the
thing
exists
and
hence
the
proof
of
the
thing
s
existence
is
a
necessary
step
to
its
proof
both
propositions
however
in
spite
of
this
immense
difference
between
them
are
commonly
expressed
in
the
same
terms
we
use
the
same
words
when
we
assert
an
ethical
proposition
about
a
subject
that
is
actually
real
and
when
we
assert
it
about
a
subject
considered
as
merely
possible
in
this
ambiguity
of
language
we
have
then
a
possible
source
of
error
with
regard
to
the
bearing
of
truths
that
assert
reality
upon
truths
that
assert
goodness
and
that
this
ambiguity
is
actually
neglected
by
those
metaphysical
writers
who
profess
that
the
supreme
good
consists
in
an
eternal
reality
may
be
shewn
in
the
following
way
we
have
seen
in
considering
the
possible
bearing
of
metaphysics
upon
practical
ethics
that
since
what
exists
eternally
can
not
possibly
be
affected
by
our
actions
no
practical
maxim
can
possibly
be
true
if
the
sole
reality
is
eternal
this
fact
as
i
said
is
commonly
neglected
by
metaphysical
writers
they
assert
both
of
the
two
contradictory
propositions
that
the
sole
reality
is
eternal
and
that
its
realisation
in
the
future
is
a
good
too
mackenzie
we
saw
asserts
that
we
ought
to
aim
at
the
realisation
of
the
true
self
or
the
rational
universe
and
yet
mackenzie
holds
as
the
word
true
plainly
implies
that
both
the
true
self
and
the
rational
universe
are
eternally
real
here
we
have
already
a
contradiction
in
the
supposition
that
what
is
eternally
real
can
be
realised
in
the
future
and
it
is
comparatively
unimportant
whether
or
not
we
add
to
this
the
further
contradiction
involved
in
the
supposition
that
the
eternal
is
the
sole
reality
that
such
a
contradiction
should
be
supposed
valid
can
only
be
explained
by
a
neglect
of
the
distinction
between
a
real
subject
and
the
character
which
that
real
subject
possesses
is
eternally
real
may
indeed
be
realised
in
the
future
if
by
this
be
only
meant
the
of
which
is
eternally
real
but
when
we
assert
that
a
thing
is
good
what
we
mean
is
that
its
existence
or
reality
is
good
and
the
eternal
existence
of
a
thing
can
not
possibly
be
the
same
good
as
the
existence
in
time
of
what
in
a
necessary
sense
is
nevertheless
the
thing
when
therefore
we
are
told
that
the
future
realisation
of
the
self
is
good
this
can
at
most
only
mean
that
the
future
realisation
of
a
self
the
self
which
is
true
and
exists
eternally
is
good
if
this
fact
were
clearly
stated
instead
of
consistently
ignored
by
those
who
advocate
the
view
that
the
supreme
good
can
be
defined
in
these
metaphysical
terms
it
seems
probable
that
the
view
that
a
knowledge
of
reality
is
necessary
to
a
knowledge
of
the
supreme
good
would
lose
part
of
its
plausibility
that
that
at
which
we
ought
to
aim
can
not
possibly
be
that
which
is
eternally
real
even
if
it
be
exactly
like
it
and
that
the
eternal
reality
can
not
possibly
be
the
sole
good
these
two
propositions
seem
sensibly
to
diminish
the
probability
that
ethics
must
be
based
on
metaphysics
it
is
not
very
plausible
to
maintain
that
because
one
thing
is
real
therefore
something
like
it
which
is
not
real
would
be
good
it
seems
therefore
that
some
of
the
plausibility
of
metaphysical
ethics
may
be
reasonably
attributed
to
the
failure
to
observe
that
verbal
ambiguity
whereby
this
is
good
may
mean
either
this
real
thing
is
good
or
the
existence
of
this
thing
whether
it
exists
or
not
would
be
by
exposing
this
ambiguity
then
we
are
enabled
to
see
more
clearly
what
must
be
meant
by
the
question
can
ethics
be
based
on
metaphysics
and
we
are
therefore
more
likely
to
find
the
correct
answer
it
is
now
plain
that
a
metaphysical
principle
of
ethics
which
says
this
eternal
reality
is
the
supreme
good
can
only
mean
something
like
this
eternal
reality
would
be
the
supreme
we
are
now
to
understand
such
principles
as
having
the
only
meaning
which
they
can
consistently
have
namely
as
describing
the
kind
of
thing
which
ought
to
exist
in
the
future
and
which
we
ought
to
try
to
bring
about
and
when
this
is
clearly
recognised
it
seems
more
evident
that
the
knowledge
that
such
a
kind
of
thing
is
also
eternally
real
can
not
help
us
at
all
towards
deciding
the
properly
ethical
question
is
the
existence
of
that
kind
of
good
thing
if
we
can
see
that
an
eternal
reality
is
good
we
can
see
equally
easily
once
the
idea
of
such
a
thing
has
been
suggested
to
us
that
it
be
good
the
metaphysical
construction
of
reality
would
therefore
be
quite
as
useful
for
the
purposes
of
ethics
if
it
were
a
mere
construction
of
an
imaginary
utopia
provided
the
kind
of
thing
suggested
is
the
same
fiction
is
as
useful
as
truth
for
giving
us
matter
upon
which
to
exercise
the
judgment
of
value
though
therefore
we
admit
that
metaphysics
may
serve
an
ethical
purpose
in
suggesting
things
which
would
not
otherwise
have
occurred
to
us
but
which
when
they
are
suggested
we
see
to
be
good
yet
it
is
not
as
metaphysics
as
professing
to
tell
us
what
is
real
that
it
has
this
use
and
in
fact
the
pursuit
of
truth
must
limit
the
usefulness
of
metaphysics
in
this
respect
wild
and
extravagant
as
are
the
assertions
which
metaphysicians
have
made
about
reality
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
but
that
they
have
been
partially
deterred
from
making
them
wilder
still
by
the
idea
that
it
was
their
business
to
tell
nothing
but
the
truth
but
the
wilder
they
are
and
the
less
useful
for
metaphysics
the
more
useful
will
they
be
for
ethics
since
in
order
to
be
sure
that
we
have
neglected
nothing
in
the
description
of
our
ideal
we
should
have
had
before
us
as
wide
a
field
as
possible
of
suggested
goods
it
is
probable
that
this
utility
of
metaphysics
in
suggesting
possible
ideals
may
sometimes
be
what
is
meant
by
the
assertion
that
ethics
should
be
based
on
metaphysics
it
is
not
uncommon
to
find
that
which
suggests
a
truth
confused
with
that
on
which
it
logically
depends
and
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
metaphysical
have
in
general
this
superiority
over
naturalistic
systems
that
they
conceive
the
supreme
good
as
something
differing
more
widely
from
what
exists
here
and
now
but
if
it
be
recognised
that
in
this
sense
ethics
should
far
more
emphatically
be
fiction
metaphysicians
will
i
think
admit
that
a
connection
of
this
kind
between
metaphysics
and
ethics
would
by
no
means
justify
the
importance
which
they
attribute
to
the
bearing
of
the
one
study
on
the
other
we
may
then
attribute
the
obstinate
prejudice
that
a
knowledge
of
supersensible
reality
is
a
necessary
step
to
a
knowledge
of
what
is
good
in
itself
partly
to
a
failure
to
perceive
that
the
subject
of
the
latter
judgment
is
not
anything
as
such
and
partly
to
a
failure
to
distinguish
the
cause
of
our
perception
of
a
truth
from
the
reason
why
it
is
true
but
these
two
causes
will
carry
us
only
a
very
little
way
in
our
explanation
of
why
metaphysics
should
have
been
supposed
to
have
a
bearing
upon
ethics
the
first
explanation
which
i
have
given
would
only
account
for
the
supposition
that
a
thing
s
reality
is
a
for
its
goodness
this
supposition
is
indeed
commonly
made
we
find
it
commonly
presupposed
that
unless
a
thing
can
be
shewn
to
be
involved
in
the
constitution
of
reality
it
can
not
be
good
and
it
is
therefore
worth
while
to
insist
that
this
is
not
the
case
that
metaphysics
is
not
even
necessary
to
furnish
of
the
basis
of
ethics
but
when
metaphysicians
talk
of
basing
ethics
on
metaphysics
they
commonly
mean
much
more
than
this
they
commonly
mean
that
metaphysics
is
the
basis
of
ethics
that
it
furnishes
not
only
one
necessary
condition
but
the
conditions
necessary
to
prove
that
certain
things
are
good
and
this
view
may
at
first
sight
appear
to
be
held
in
two
different
forms
it
may
be
asserted
that
merely
to
prove
a
thing
supersensibly
real
is
sufficient
to
prove
it
good
that
the
truly
real
must
for
that
reason
alone
be
truly
good
but
more
commonly
it
appears
to
be
held
that
the
real
must
be
good
because
it
possesses
certain
characters
and
we
may
i
think
reduce
the
first
kind
of
assertion
to
no
more
than
this
when
it
is
asserted
that
the
real
must
be
good
because
it
is
real
it
is
commonly
also
held
that
this
is
only
because
in
order
to
be
real
it
must
be
of
a
certain
kind
the
reasoning
by
which
it
is
thought
that
a
metaphysical
enquiry
can
give
an
ethical
conclusion
is
of
the
following
form
from
a
consideration
of
what
it
is
to
be
real
we
can
infer
that
what
is
real
must
have
certain
supersensible
properties
but
to
have
these
properties
is
identical
with
being
good
it
is
the
very
meaning
of
the
word
it
follows
therefore
that
what
has
these
properties
is
good
and
from
a
consideration
of
what
it
is
to
be
real
we
can
again
infer
what
it
is
that
has
these
properties
it
is
plain
that
if
such
reasoning
were
correct
any
answer
which
could
be
given
to
the
question
what
is
good
in
itself
could
be
arrived
at
by
a
purely
metaphysical
discussion
and
by
that
alone
just
as
when
mill
supposed
that
to
be
good
to
be
desired
the
question
what
is
good
could
be
and
must
be
answered
solely
by
an
empirical
investigation
of
the
question
what
was
desired
so
here
if
to
be
good
means
to
have
some
supersensible
property
the
ethical
question
can
and
must
be
answered
by
a
metaphysical
enquiry
into
the
question
what
has
this
property
what
then
remains
to
be
done
in
order
to
destroy
the
plausibility
of
metaphysical
ethics
is
to
expose
the
chief
errors
which
seem
to
have
led
metaphysicians
to
suppose
that
to
be
good
to
possess
some
supersensible
property
what
then
are
the
chief
reasons
which
have
made
it
seem
plausible
to
maintain
that
to
be
good
must
to
possess
some
supersensible
property
or
to
be
related
to
some
supersensible
reality
we
may
first
of
all
notice
one
which
seems
to
have
had
some
influence
in
causing
the
view
that
good
must
be
defined
by
such
property
although
it
does
not
suggest
any
property
as
the
one
required
this
reason
lies
in
the
supposition
that
the
proposition
this
is
good
or
this
would
be
good
if
it
existed
must
in
a
certain
respect
be
of
the
same
type
as
other
propositions
the
fact
is
that
there
is
one
type
of
proposition
so
familiar
to
everyone
and
therefore
having
such
a
strong
hold
upon
the
imagination
that
philosophers
have
always
supposed
that
all
other
types
must
be
reducible
to
it
this
type
is
that
of
the
objects
of
experience
of
all
those
truths
which
occupy
our
minds
for
the
immensely
greater
part
of
our
waking
lives
truths
such
as
that
somebody
is
in
the
room
that
i
am
writing
or
eating
or
talking
all
these
truths
however
much
they
may
differ
have
this
in
common
that
in
them
both
the
grammatical
subject
and
the
grammatical
predicate
stand
for
something
which
exists
immensely
the
commonest
type
of
truth
then
is
one
which
asserts
a
relation
between
two
existing
things
ethical
truths
are
immediately
felt
not
to
conform
to
this
type
and
the
naturalistic
fallacy
arises
from
the
attempt
to
make
out
that
in
some
roundabout
way
they
do
conform
to
it
it
is
immediately
obvious
that
when
we
see
a
thing
to
be
good
its
goodness
is
not
a
property
which
we
can
take
up
in
our
hands
or
separate
from
it
even
by
the
most
delicate
scientific
instruments
and
transfer
to
something
else
it
is
not
in
fact
like
most
of
the
predicates
which
we
ascribe
to
things
a
of
the
thing
to
which
we
ascribe
it
but
philosophers
suppose
that
the
reason
why
we
can
not
take
goodness
up
and
move
it
about
is
not
that
it
is
a
different
of
object
from
any
which
can
be
moved
about
but
only
that
it
exists
together
with
anything
with
which
it
does
exist
they
explain
the
type
of
ethical
truths
by
supposing
it
identical
with
the
type
of
scientific
laws
and
it
is
only
when
they
have
done
this
that
the
naturalistic
philosophers
proper
those
who
are
empiricists
and
those
whom
i
have
called
metaphysical
part
company
these
two
classes
of
philosophers
do
indeed
differ
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
scientific
laws
the
former
class
tend
to
suppose
that
when
they
say
this
always
accompanies
that
they
mean
only
this
has
accompanied
does
now
and
will
accompany
that
in
these
particular
instances
they
reduce
the
scientific
law
quite
simply
and
directly
to
the
familiar
type
of
proposition
which
i
have
pointed
out
but
this
does
not
satisfy
the
metaphysicians
they
see
that
when
you
say
this
would
accompany
that
that
existed
you
don
t
mean
only
that
this
and
that
have
existed
and
will
exist
together
so
many
times
but
it
is
beyond
even
their
powers
to
believe
that
what
you
do
mean
is
merely
what
you
say
they
still
think
you
must
mean
somehow
or
other
that
something
does
exist
since
that
is
what
you
generally
mean
when
you
say
anything
they
are
as
unable
as
the
empiricists
to
imagine
that
you
can
ever
mean
that
the
empiricists
say
this
means
that
so
many
couples
of
couples
of
things
have
in
each
case
been
four
things
and
hence
that
and
would
not
make
unless
precisely
those
things
had
existed
the
metaphysicians
feel
that
this
is
wrong
but
they
themselves
have
no
better
account
of
its
meaning
to
give
than
either
with
leibniz
that
god
s
mind
is
in
a
certain
state
or
with
kant
that
your
mind
is
in
a
certain
state
or
finally
with
mr
bradley
that
something
is
in
a
certain
state
here
then
we
have
the
root
of
the
naturalistic
fallacy
the
metaphysicians
have
the
merit
of
seeing
that
when
you
say
this
would
be
good
if
it
existed
you
can
t
mean
merely
this
has
existed
and
was
desired
however
many
times
that
may
have
been
the
case
they
will
admit
that
some
good
things
have
not
existed
in
this
world
and
even
that
some
may
not
have
been
desired
but
what
you
can
mean
except
that
exists
they
really
can
not
see
precisely
the
same
error
which
leads
them
to
suppose
that
there
must
a
supersensible
reality
leads
them
to
commit
the
naturalistic
fallacy
with
regard
to
the
meaning
of
every
truth
they
think
must
mean
somehow
that
something
exists
and
since
unlike
the
empiricists
they
recognise
some
truths
which
do
not
mean
that
anything
exists
here
and
now
these
they
think
must
mean
that
something
exists
here
and
now
on
the
same
principle
since
good
is
a
predicate
which
neither
does
nor
can
exist
they
are
bound
to
suppose
either
that
to
be
good
means
to
be
related
to
some
other
particular
thing
which
can
exist
and
does
exist
in
reality
or
else
that
it
means
merely
to
belong
to
the
real
world
that
goodness
is
transcended
or
absorbed
in
reality
that
such
a
reduction
of
propositions
to
the
type
of
those
which
assert
either
that
something
exists
or
that
something
which
exists
has
a
certain
attribute
which
means
that
both
exist
in
a
certain
relation
to
one
another
is
erroneous
may
easily
be
seen
by
reference
to
the
particular
class
of
ethical
propositions
for
whatever
we
may
have
proved
to
exist
and
whatever
two
existents
we
may
have
proved
to
be
necessarily
connected
with
one
another
it
still
remains
a
distinct
and
different
question
whether
what
thus
exists
is
good
whether
either
or
both
of
the
two
existents
is
so
and
whether
it
is
good
that
they
should
exist
together
to
assert
the
one
is
plainly
and
obviously
the
same
thing
as
to
assert
the
other
we
understand
what
we
mean
by
asking
is
this
which
exists
or
necessarily
exists
after
all
good
and
we
perceive
that
we
are
asking
a
question
which
has
been
answered
in
face
of
this
direct
perception
that
the
two
questions
are
distinct
no
proof
that
they
be
identical
can
have
the
slightest
value
that
the
proposition
this
is
good
is
thus
distinct
from
every
other
proposition
was
proved
in
chapter
and
i
may
now
illustrate
this
fact
by
pointing
out
how
it
is
distinguished
from
two
particular
propositions
with
which
it
has
commonly
been
identified
that
so
and
so
to
be
is
commonly
called
a
moral
and
this
phrase
naturally
suggests
that
this
proposition
is
in
some
way
analogous
either
to
a
natural
law
or
to
a
law
in
the
legal
sense
or
to
both
all
three
are
in
fact
really
analogous
in
one
respect
and
in
one
respect
only
that
they
include
a
proposition
which
is
a
moral
law
asserts
this
is
good
all
a
natural
law
asserts
this
happens
all
and
a
law
in
the
legal
sense
it
is
commanded
that
this
be
done
or
be
left
undone
all
but
since
it
is
very
natural
to
suppose
that
the
analogy
extends
further
and
that
the
assertion
this
is
good
in
all
cases
is
equivalent
to
the
assertion
this
happens
in
all
cases
or
to
the
assertion
it
is
commanded
that
this
be
done
in
all
cases
it
may
be
useful
briefly
to
point
out
that
they
are
equivalent
the
fallacy
of
supposing
moral
law
to
be
analogous
to
natural
law
in
respect
of
asserting
that
some
action
is
one
which
is
always
necessarily
done
is
contained
in
one
of
the
most
famous
doctrines
of
kant
kant
identifies
what
ought
to
be
with
the
law
according
to
which
a
free
or
pure
will
act
with
the
only
kind
of
action
which
is
possible
for
it
and
by
this
identification
he
does
not
mean
merely
to
assert
that
the
free
will
is
under
the
necessity
of
doing
what
it
ought
he
means
that
what
it
ought
to
do
nothing
but
its
own
law
the
law
according
to
which
it
must
act
it
differs
from
the
human
will
just
in
that
what
ought
to
do
is
what
necessarily
does
it
is
autonomous
and
by
this
is
meant
among
other
things
that
there
is
no
separate
standard
by
which
it
can
be
judged
that
the
question
is
the
law
by
which
this
will
acts
a
good
one
is
in
its
case
meaningless
it
follows
that
what
is
necessarily
willed
by
this
pure
will
is
good
not
that
will
is
good
nor
for
any
other
reason
but
merely
because
it
is
what
is
necessarily
willed
by
a
pure
will
kant
s
assertion
of
the
autonomy
of
the
practical
reason
thus
has
the
very
opposite
effect
to
that
which
he
desired
it
makes
his
ethics
ultimately
and
hopelessly
his
moral
law
is
independent
of
metaphysics
only
in
the
sense
that
according
to
him
we
can
it
independently
he
holds
that
we
can
only
infer
that
there
is
freedom
from
the
fact
that
the
moral
law
is
true
and
so
far
as
he
keeps
strictly
to
this
view
he
does
avoid
the
error
into
which
most
metaphysical
writers
fall
of
allowing
his
opinions
as
to
what
is
real
to
influence
his
judgments
of
what
is
good
but
he
fails
to
see
that
on
his
view
the
moral
law
is
dependent
upon
freedom
in
a
far
more
important
sense
than
that
in
which
freedom
depends
on
the
moral
law
he
admits
that
freedom
is
the
of
the
moral
law
whereas
the
latter
is
only
of
freedom
and
this
means
that
unless
reality
be
such
as
he
says
no
assertion
that
this
is
good
can
possibly
be
true
it
can
indeed
have
no
meaning
he
has
therefore
furnished
his
opponents
with
a
conclusive
method
of
attacking
the
validity
of
the
moral
law
if
they
can
only
shew
by
some
other
means
which
he
denies
to
be
possible
but
leaves
theoretically
open
that
the
nature
of
reality
is
not
such
as
he
says
he
can
not
deny
that
they
will
have
proved
his
ethical
principle
to
be
false
if
that
this
ought
to
be
done
this
is
willed
by
a
free
will
then
if
it
can
be
shewn
that
there
is
no
free
will
which
wills
anything
it
will
follow
that
nothing
ought
to
be
done
and
kant
also
commits
the
fallacy
of
supposing
that
this
ought
to
be
means
this
is
he
conceives
the
moral
law
to
be
an
imperative
and
this
is
a
very
common
mistake
this
ought
to
be
it
is
assumed
must
mean
this
is
commanded
nothing
therefore
would
be
good
unless
it
were
commanded
and
since
commands
in
this
world
are
liable
to
be
erroneous
what
ought
to
be
in
its
ultimate
sense
means
what
is
commanded
by
some
real
supersensible
with
regard
to
this
authority
it
is
then
no
longer
possible
to
ask
is
it
righteous
its
commands
can
not
fail
to
be
right
because
to
be
right
means
to
be
what
it
commands
here
therefore
law
in
the
moral
sense
is
supposed
analogous
to
law
in
the
legal
sense
rather
than
as
in
the
last
instance
to
law
in
the
natural
sense
it
is
supposed
that
moral
obligation
is
analogous
to
legal
obligation
with
this
difference
only
that
whereas
the
source
of
legal
obligation
is
earthly
that
of
moral
obligation
is
heavenly
yet
it
is
obvious
that
if
by
a
source
of
obligation
is
meant
only
a
power
which
binds
you
or
compels
you
to
do
a
thing
it
is
not
because
it
does
do
this
that
you
ought
to
obey
it
it
is
only
if
it
be
itself
so
good
that
it
commands
and
enforces
only
what
is
good
that
it
can
be
a
source
of
moral
obligation
and
in
that
case
what
it
commands
and
enforces
would
be
good
whether
commanded
and
enforced
or
not
just
that
which
makes
an
obligation
legal
namely
the
fact
that
it
is
commanded
by
a
certain
kind
of
authority
is
entirely
irrelevant
to
a
moral
obligation
however
an
authority
be
defined
its
commands
will
be
binding
only
if
they
are
morally
binding
only
if
they
tell
us
what
ought
to
be
or
what
is
a
means
to
that
which
ought
to
be
in
this
last
error
in
the
supposition
that
when
i
say
you
ought
to
do
this
i
must
mean
you
are
commanded
to
do
this
we
have
one
of
the
reasons
which
has
led
to
the
supposition
that
the
particular
supersensible
property
by
reference
to
which
good
must
be
defined
is
will
and
that
ethical
conclusions
may
be
obtained
by
enquiring
into
the
nature
of
a
fundamentally
real
will
seems
to
be
by
far
the
commonest
assumption
of
metaphysical
ethics
at
the
present
day
but
this
assumption
seems
to
owe
its
plausibility
not
so
much
to
the
supposition
that
ought
expresses
a
command
as
to
a
far
more
fundamental
error
this
error
consists
in
supposing
that
to
ascribe
certain
predicates
to
a
thing
is
the
same
thing
as
to
say
that
that
thing
is
the
object
of
a
certain
kind
of
psychical
state
it
is
supposed
that
to
say
that
a
thing
is
real
or
true
is
the
same
thing
as
to
say
that
it
is
known
in
a
certain
way
and
that
the
difference
between
the
assertion
that
it
is
good
and
the
assertion
that
it
is
real
between
an
ethical
therefore
and
a
metaphysical
proposition
in
the
fact
that
whereas
the
latter
asserts
its
relation
to
cognition
the
former
asserts
its
relation
to
will
now
that
this
is
an
error
has
been
already
shewn
in
chapter
i
that
the
assertion
this
is
good
is
identical
with
the
assertion
this
is
willed
either
by
a
supersensible
will
or
otherwise
nor
with
any
other
proposition
has
been
proved
nor
can
i
add
anything
to
that
proof
but
in
face
of
this
proof
it
may
be
anticipated
that
two
lines
of
defence
may
be
taken
up
it
may
be
maintained
that
nevertheless
they
really
are
identical
and
facts
may
be
pointed
out
which
seem
to
prove
that
identity
or
else
it
may
be
said
that
an
identity
is
not
maintained
that
it
is
only
meant
to
assert
that
there
is
some
special
connection
between
will
and
goodness
such
as
makes
an
enquiry
into
the
real
nature
of
the
former
an
essential
step
in
the
proof
of
ethical
conclusions
in
order
to
meet
these
two
possible
objections
i
propose
first
to
shew
what
possible
connections
there
are
or
may
be
between
goodness
and
will
and
that
none
of
these
can
justify
us
in
asserting
that
this
is
good
is
identical
with
this
is
on
the
other
hand
it
will
appear
that
some
of
them
may
be
easily
confused
with
this
assertion
of
identity
and
that
therefore
the
confusion
is
likely
to
have
been
made
this
part
of
my
argument
will
therefore
already
go
some
way
towards
meeting
the
second
objection
but
what
must
be
conclusive
against
this
is
to
shew
that
any
possible
connection
between
will
and
goodness
the
identity
in
question
would
not
be
sufficient
to
give
an
enquiry
into
will
the
smallest
relevance
to
the
proof
of
any
ethical
conclusion
it
has
been
customary
since
kant
s
time
to
assert
that
cognition
volition
and
feeling
are
three
fundamentally
distinct
attitudes
of
the
mind
towards
reality
they
are
three
distinct
ways
of
experiencing
and
each
of
them
informs
us
of
a
distinct
aspect
under
which
reality
may
be
considered
the
epistemological
method
of
approaching
metaphysics
rests
on
the
assumption
that
by
considering
what
is
implied
in
cognition
what
is
its
ideal
we
may
discover
what
properties
the
world
must
have
if
it
is
to
be
and
similarly
it
is
held
that
by
considering
what
is
implied
in
the
fact
of
willing
or
feeling
what
is
the
ideal
which
they
presuppose
we
may
discover
what
properties
the
world
must
have
if
it
is
to
be
good
or
beautiful
the
orthodox
idealistic
epistemologist
differs
from
the
sensationalist
or
empiricist
in
holding
that
what
we
directly
cognise
is
neither
all
true
nor
yet
the
whole
truth
in
order
to
reject
the
false
and
to
discover
further
truths
we
must
he
says
not
take
cognition
merely
as
it
presents
itself
but
discover
what
is
in
it
and
similarly
the
orthodox
metaphysical
ethicist
differs
from
the
mere
naturalist
in
holding
that
not
everything
which
we
actually
will
is
good
nor
if
good
completely
good
what
is
really
good
is
that
which
is
implied
in
the
essential
nature
of
will
others
again
think
that
feeling
and
not
will
is
the
fundamental
for
ethics
but
in
either
case
it
is
agreed
that
ethics
has
some
relation
to
will
or
feeling
which
it
has
not
to
cognition
and
which
other
objects
of
study
have
to
cognition
will
or
feeling
on
the
one
hand
and
cognition
on
the
other
are
regarded
as
in
some
sense
coordinate
sources
of
philosophical
knowledge
the
one
of
practical
the
other
of
theoretical
philosophy
what
that
is
true
can
possibly
be
meant
by
this
view
first
of
all
it
may
be
meant
that
just
as
by
reflection
on
our
perceptual
and
sensory
experience
we
become
aware
of
the
distinction
between
truth
and
falsehood
so
it
is
by
reflection
on
our
experiences
of
feeling
and
willing
that
we
become
aware
of
ethical
distinctions
we
should
not
know
what
was
meant
by
thinking
one
thing
better
than
another
unless
the
attitude
of
our
will
or
feeling
towards
one
thing
was
different
from
its
attitude
towards
another
all
this
may
be
admitted
but
so
far
we
have
only
the
psychological
fact
that
it
is
only
we
will
or
feel
things
in
a
certain
way
that
we
ever
come
to
think
them
good
just
as
it
is
only
because
we
have
certain
perceptual
experiences
that
we
ever
come
to
think
things
true
here
then
is
a
special
connection
between
willing
and
goodness
but
it
is
only
a
connection
that
willing
is
a
necessary
condition
for
the
cognition
of
goodness
but
it
may
be
said
further
that
willing
and
feeling
are
not
only
the
origin
of
cognitions
of
goodness
but
that
to
will
a
thing
or
to
have
a
certain
feeling
towards
a
thing
is
the
as
to
think
it
good
and
it
may
be
admitted
that
even
this
is
true
in
a
sense
it
does
seem
to
be
true
that
we
hardly
ever
think
a
thing
good
and
never
very
decidedly
without
at
the
same
time
having
a
special
attitude
of
feeling
or
will
towards
it
though
it
is
certainly
not
the
case
that
this
is
true
universally
and
the
converse
may
possibly
be
true
universally
it
may
be
the
case
that
a
perception
of
goodness
is
included
in
the
complex
facts
which
we
mean
by
willing
and
by
having
certain
kinds
of
feeling
let
us
admit
then
that
to
think
a
thing
good
and
to
will
it
are
same
in
this
sense
that
wherever
the
latter
occurs
the
former
also
occurs
as
a
of
it
and
even
that
they
are
the
same
in
the
converse
sense
that
when
the
former
occurs
it
is
generally
a
part
of
the
latter
these
facts
may
seem
to
give
countenance
to
the
general
assertion
that
to
think
a
thing
good
is
to
prefer
it
or
approve
it
in
the
sense
in
which
preference
and
approval
denote
certain
kinds
of
will
or
feeling
it
seems
to
be
always
true
that
when
we
thus
prefer
or
approve
there
is
included
in
that
fact
the
fact
that
we
think
good
and
it
is
certainly
true
in
an
immense
majority
of
instances
that
when
we
think
good
we
also
prefer
or
approve
it
is
natural
enough
then
to
say
that
to
think
good
is
to
prefer
and
what
more
natural
than
to
add
when
i
say
a
thing
is
good
i
that
i
prefer
it
and
yet
this
natural
addition
involves
a
gross
confusion
even
if
it
be
true
that
to
think
good
is
the
same
thing
as
to
prefer
which
as
we
have
seen
is
true
in
the
sense
that
they
are
absolutely
identical
and
not
true
even
in
the
sense
that
they
occur
together
yet
it
is
not
true
that
you
think
when
you
think
a
thing
good
is
you
prefer
it
even
if
your
thinking
the
thing
good
is
the
same
thing
as
your
preference
of
it
yet
the
goodness
of
the
thing
that
which
you
think
is
for
that
very
reason
obviously
the
same
thing
as
your
preference
of
it
whether
you
have
a
certain
thought
or
not
is
one
question
and
whether
what
you
think
is
true
is
quite
a
different
one
upon
which
the
answer
to
the
first
has
not
the
least
bearing
the
fact
that
you
prefer
a
thing
does
not
tend
to
shew
that
the
thing
is
good
even
if
it
does
shew
that
you
think
it
so
it
seems
to
be
owing
to
this
confusion
that
the
question
what
is
good
is
thought
to
be
identical
with
the
question
what
is
preferred
it
is
said
with
sufficient
truth
that
you
would
never
know
a
thing
was
good
unless
you
preferred
it
just
as
you
would
never
know
a
thing
existed
unless
you
perceived
it
but
it
is
added
and
this
is
false
that
you
would
never
know
a
thing
was
good
unless
you
that
you
preferred
it
or
that
it
existed
unless
you
that
you
perceived
it
and
it
is
finally
added
and
this
is
utterly
false
that
you
can
not
distinguish
the
fact
that
a
thing
is
good
from
the
fact
that
you
prefer
it
or
the
fact
that
it
exists
from
the
fact
that
you
perceive
it
it
is
often
pointed
out
that
i
can
not
at
any
given
moment
distinguish
what
is
true
from
what
i
think
so
and
this
is
true
but
though
i
can
not
distinguish
is
true
from
i
think
so
i
always
can
distinguish
what
i
mean
by
saying
it
is
true
from
what
i
mean
by
saying
i
think
so
for
i
understand
the
meaning
of
the
supposition
that
what
i
think
true
may
nevertheless
be
false
when
therefore
i
assert
that
it
is
true
i
mean
to
assert
something
different
from
the
fact
that
i
think
so
i
think
namely
something
is
true
is
always
quite
distinct
from
the
fact
that
i
think
it
the
assertion
that
it
is
true
does
not
even
the
assertion
that
i
think
it
so
although
of
course
whenever
i
do
think
a
thing
true
it
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
also
true
that
i
do
think
it
this
tautologous
proposition
that
for
a
thing
to
be
thought
true
it
is
necessary
that
it
should
be
thought
is
however
commonly
identified
with
the
proposition
that
for
a
thing
to
true
it
is
necessary
that
it
should
be
thought
a
very
little
reflection
should
suffice
to
convince
anyone
that
this
identification
is
erroneous
and
a
very
little
more
will
shew
that
if
so
we
must
mean
by
true
something
which
includes
no
reference
to
thinking
or
to
any
other
psychical
fact
it
may
be
difficult
to
discover
precisely
we
mean
to
hold
the
object
in
question
before
us
so
as
to
compare
it
with
other
objects
but
that
we
do
mean
something
distinct
and
unique
can
no
longer
be
matter
of
doubt
that
to
be
true
to
be
thought
in
a
certain
way
is
therefore
certainly
false
yet
this
assertion
plays
the
most
essential
part
in
kant
s
copernican
revolution
of
philosophy
and
renders
worthless
the
whole
mass
of
modern
literature
to
which
that
revolution
has
given
rise
and
which
is
called
epistemology
kant
held
that
what
was
unified
in
a
certain
manner
by
the
synthetic
activity
of
thought
was
true
that
this
was
the
very
meaning
of
the
word
whereas
it
is
plain
that
the
only
connection
which
can
possibly
hold
between
being
true
and
being
thought
in
a
certain
way
is
that
the
latter
should
be
a
or
test
of
the
former
in
order
however
to
establish
that
it
is
so
it
would
be
necessary
to
establish
by
the
methods
of
induction
that
what
was
true
was
always
thought
in
a
certain
way
modern
epistemology
dispenses
with
this
long
and
difficult
investigation
at
the
cost
of
the
assumption
that
truth
and
the
criterion
of
truth
are
one
and
the
same
thing
it
is
then
a
very
natural
though
an
utterly
false
supposition
that
for
a
thing
to
true
is
the
same
thing
as
for
it
to
be
perceived
or
thought
of
in
a
certain
way
and
since
for
the
reasons
given
above
the
fact
of
preference
seems
roughly
to
stand
in
the
same
relation
to
thinking
things
good
in
which
the
fact
of
perception
stands
to
thinking
that
they
are
true
or
exist
it
is
very
natural
that
for
a
thing
to
good
should
be
supposed
identical
with
its
being
preferred
in
a
certain
way
but
once
this
coordination
of
volition
and
cognition
has
been
accepted
it
is
again
very
natural
that
every
fact
which
seems
to
support
the
conclusion
that
being
true
is
identical
with
being
cognised
should
confirm
the
corresponding
conclusion
that
being
good
is
identical
with
being
willed
it
will
therefore
be
in
place
to
point
out
another
confusion
which
seems
to
have
had
great
influence
in
causing
acceptance
of
the
view
that
to
be
true
is
the
same
thing
as
to
be
cognised
this
confusion
is
due
to
a
failure
to
observe
that
when
we
say
we
have
a
or
or
that
we
a
thing
we
mean
to
assert
not
only
that
our
mind
is
cognitive
but
that
that
which
it
cognises
is
true
it
is
not
observed
that
the
usage
of
these
words
is
such
that
if
a
thing
be
untrue
that
fact
alone
is
sufficient
to
justify
us
in
saying
that
the
person
who
says
he
perceives
or
knows
it
does
not
or
it
without
our
either
enquiring
whether
or
assuming
that
his
state
of
mind
differs
in
any
respect
from
what
it
would
have
been
had
he
perceived
or
known
by
this
denial
we
do
not
accuse
him
of
an
error
in
introspection
even
if
there
was
such
an
error
we
do
not
deny
that
he
was
aware
of
a
certain
object
nor
even
that
his
state
of
mind
was
exactly
such
as
he
took
it
to
be
we
merely
deny
that
the
object
of
which
he
was
aware
had
a
certain
property
it
is
however
commonly
supposed
that
when
we
assert
a
thing
to
be
perceived
or
known
we
are
asserting
one
fact
only
and
since
of
the
two
facts
which
we
really
assert
the
existence
of
a
psychical
state
is
by
far
the
easier
to
distinguish
it
is
supposed
that
this
is
the
only
one
which
we
do
assert
thus
perception
and
sensation
have
come
to
be
regarded
as
if
they
denoted
certain
states
of
mind
and
nothing
more
a
mistake
which
was
the
easier
to
make
since
the
commonest
state
of
mind
to
which
we
give
a
name
which
does
not
imply
that
its
object
is
true
namely
imagination
may
with
some
plausibility
be
supposed
to
differ
from
sensation
and
perception
not
only
in
the
property
possessed
by
its
object
but
also
in
its
character
as
a
state
of
mind
it
has
thus
come
to
be
supposed
that
the
only
difference
between
perception
and
imagination
by
which
they
can
be
defined
must
be
a
merely
psychical
difference
and
if
this
were
the
case
it
would
follow
at
once
that
to
true
was
identical
with
being
cognised
in
a
certain
way
since
the
assertion
that
a
thing
is
perceived
does
certainly
the
assertion
that
it
is
true
and
if
nevertheless
that
it
is
perceived
means
that
the
mind
has
a
certain
attitude
towards
it
then
its
truth
must
be
identical
with
the
fact
that
it
is
regarded
in
this
way
we
may
then
attribute
the
view
that
to
be
true
to
be
cognised
in
a
certain
way
partly
to
the
failure
to
perceive
that
certain
words
which
are
commonly
supposed
to
stand
for
nothing
more
than
a
certain
kind
of
cognitive
state
do
in
fact
include
a
reference
to
the
truth
of
the
object
of
such
states
i
will
now
sum
up
my
account
of
the
apparent
connections
between
will
and
ethical
propositions
which
seem
to
support
the
vague
conviction
that
this
is
good
is
somehow
identical
with
this
is
willed
in
a
certain
it
may
be
maintained
with
sufficient
show
of
truth
that
it
is
only
because
certain
things
were
originally
willed
that
we
ever
came
to
have
ethical
convictions
at
all
and
it
has
been
too
commonly
assumed
that
to
shew
what
was
the
cause
of
a
thing
is
the
same
thing
as
to
shew
what
the
thing
itself
is
it
is
however
hardly
necessary
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
the
case
it
may
be
further
maintained
with
some
plausibility
that
to
think
a
thing
good
and
to
will
it
in
a
certain
way
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
identical
we
must
however
distinguish
certain
possible
meanings
of
this
assertion
it
may
be
admitted
that
when
we
think
a
thing
good
we
have
a
special
attitude
of
will
or
feeling
towards
it
and
that
perhaps
when
we
will
it
in
a
certain
way
we
do
always
think
it
good
but
the
very
fact
that
we
can
thus
distinguish
the
question
whether
though
the
one
is
always
accompanied
by
the
other
yet
this
other
may
not
always
be
accompanied
by
the
first
shews
that
the
two
things
are
not
in
the
strict
sense
identical
the
fact
is
that
whatever
we
mean
by
will
or
by
any
form
of
will
the
fact
we
mean
by
it
certainly
always
includes
something
else
the
thinking
a
thing
good
and
hence
that
when
willing
and
thinking
good
are
asserted
to
be
identical
the
most
that
can
be
meant
is
that
this
other
element
in
will
always
both
accompanies
and
is
accompanied
by
the
thinking
good
and
this
as
has
been
said
is
of
very
doubtful
truth
even
however
if
it
were
strictly
true
the
fact
that
the
two
things
can
be
distinguished
is
fatal
to
the
assumed
coordination
between
will
and
cognition
in
one
of
the
senses
in
which
that
assumption
is
commonly
made
for
it
is
only
in
respect
of
the
element
in
will
that
volition
differs
from
cognition
whereas
it
is
only
in
respect
of
the
fact
that
volition
or
some
form
of
volition
a
of
goodness
that
will
can
have
the
same
relation
to
ethical
which
cognition
has
to
metaphysical
propositions
accordingly
the
fact
of
volition
a
that
is
if
we
include
in
it
the
element
which
makes
it
volition
and
distinguishes
it
from
cognition
has
the
same
relation
to
ethical
propositions
which
cognition
has
to
those
which
are
metaphysical
volition
and
cognition
are
coordinate
ways
of
experiencing
since
it
is
only
in
so
far
as
volition
denotes
a
fact
which
includes
in
it
the
one
identical
simple
fact
which
is
meant
by
that
volition
is
a
way
of
experiencing
at
all
but
if
we
allow
the
terms
volition
or
will
to
stand
for
thinking
good
although
they
certainly
do
not
commonly
stand
for
this
there
still
remains
the
question
what
connection
would
this
fact
establish
between
volition
and
ethics
could
the
enquiry
into
what
was
willed
be
identical
with
the
ethical
enquiry
into
what
was
good
it
is
plain
enough
that
they
could
not
be
identical
though
it
is
also
plain
why
they
should
be
thought
so
the
question
what
is
good
is
confused
with
the
question
what
is
thought
good
and
the
question
what
is
true
with
the
question
what
is
thought
true
for
two
main
reasons
one
of
these
is
the
general
difficulty
that
is
found
in
distinguishing
what
is
cognised
from
the
cognition
of
it
it
is
observed
that
i
certainly
can
not
cognise
anything
that
is
true
without
cognising
it
since
therefore
whenever
i
know
a
thing
that
is
true
the
thing
is
certainly
cognised
it
is
assumed
that
for
a
thing
to
true
at
all
is
the
same
thing
as
for
it
to
be
cognised
and
it
is
not
observed
that
certain
words
which
are
supposed
to
denote
only
peculiar
species
of
cognition
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
denote
that
the
object
cognised
is
true
thus
if
perception
be
taken
to
denote
only
a
certain
kind
of
mental
fact
then
since
the
object
of
it
is
always
true
it
becomes
easy
to
suppose
that
to
be
true
means
only
to
be
object
to
a
mental
state
of
that
kind
and
similarly
it
is
easy
to
suppose
that
to
be
truly
good
differs
from
being
falsely
thought
so
solely
in
respect
of
the
fact
that
to
be
the
former
is
to
be
the
object
of
a
volition
differing
from
that
of
which
an
apparent
good
is
the
object
in
the
same
way
in
which
a
perception
on
this
supposition
differs
from
an
illusion
being
good
then
is
not
identical
with
being
willed
or
felt
in
any
kind
of
way
any
more
than
being
true
is
identical
with
being
thought
in
any
kind
of
way
but
let
us
suppose
this
to
be
admitted
is
it
still
possible
that
an
enquiry
into
the
nature
of
will
or
feeling
should
be
a
necessary
step
to
the
proof
of
ethical
conclusions
if
being
good
and
being
willed
are
identical
then
the
most
that
can
be
maintained
with
regard
to
the
connection
of
goodness
with
will
is
that
what
is
good
is
always
willed
in
a
certain
way
and
that
what
is
willed
in
a
certain
way
is
always
good
and
it
may
be
said
that
this
is
all
that
is
meant
by
those
metaphysical
writers
who
profess
to
base
ethics
upon
the
metaphysics
of
will
what
would
follow
from
this
supposition
it
is
plain
that
if
what
is
willed
in
a
certain
way
were
always
good
then
the
fact
that
a
thing
was
so
willed
would
be
a
of
its
goodness
but
in
order
to
establish
that
will
is
a
criterion
of
goodness
we
must
be
able
to
shew
first
and
separately
that
in
a
great
number
of
the
instances
in
which
we
find
a
certain
kind
of
will
we
also
find
that
the
objects
of
that
will
are
good
we
might
then
perhaps
be
entitled
to
infer
that
in
a
few
instances
where
it
was
not
obvious
whether
a
thing
was
good
or
not
but
was
obvious
that
it
was
willed
in
the
way
required
the
thing
was
really
good
since
it
had
the
property
which
in
all
other
instances
we
had
found
to
be
accompanied
by
goodness
a
reference
to
will
might
thus
just
conceivably
become
of
use
towards
the
end
of
our
ethical
investigations
when
we
had
already
been
able
to
shew
independently
of
a
vast
number
of
different
objects
that
they
were
really
good
and
in
what
degree
they
were
so
and
against
even
this
conceivable
utility
it
may
be
urged
that
it
is
impossible
to
see
why
it
should
not
be
as
easy
and
it
would
certainly
be
the
more
secure
way
to
prove
that
the
thing
in
question
was
good
by
the
same
methods
which
we
had
used
in
proving
that
other
things
were
good
as
by
reference
to
our
criterion
and
that
if
we
set
ourselves
seriously
to
find
out
what
things
are
good
we
shall
see
reason
to
think
as
will
appear
in
chapter
vi
that
they
have
other
property
both
common
and
peculiar
to
them
beside
their
goodness
that
in
fact
there
is
no
criterion
of
goodness
but
to
consider
whether
any
form
of
will
is
or
is
not
a
criterion
of
goodness
is
quite
unnecessary
for
our
purpose
here
since
none
of
those
writers
who
profess
to
base
their
ethics
on
an
investigation
of
will
have
ever
recognised
the
need
of
proving
directly
and
independently
that
all
the
things
which
are
willed
in
a
certain
way
are
good
they
make
no
attempt
to
shew
that
will
is
a
of
goodness
and
no
stronger
evidence
could
be
given
that
they
do
not
recognise
that
this
at
most
is
all
it
can
be
as
has
been
just
pointed
out
if
we
are
to
maintain
that
whatever
is
willed
in
a
certain
way
is
also
good
we
must
in
the
first
place
be
able
to
shew
that
certain
things
have
one
property
goodness
and
that
the
same
things
have
the
other
property
that
they
are
willed
in
a
certain
way
and
secondly
we
must
be
able
to
shew
this
in
a
very
large
number
of
instances
if
we
are
to
be
entitled
to
claim
any
assent
for
the
proposition
that
these
two
properties
accompany
one
another
even
when
this
was
shewn
it
would
still
be
doubtful
whether
the
inference
from
generally
to
always
would
be
valid
and
almost
certain
that
this
doubtful
principle
would
be
useless
but
the
very
question
which
it
is
the
business
of
ethics
to
answer
is
this
question
what
things
are
good
and
so
long
as
hedonism
retains
its
present
popularity
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
a
question
upon
which
there
is
scarcely
any
agreement
and
which
therefore
requires
the
most
careful
examination
the
greatest
and
most
difficult
part
of
the
business
of
ethics
would
therefore
require
to
have
been
already
accomplished
before
we
could
be
entitled
to
claim
that
anything
was
a
of
goodness
if
on
the
other
hand
to
be
willed
in
a
certain
way
was
with
being
good
then
indeed
we
should
be
entitled
to
start
our
ethical
investigations
by
enquiring
what
was
willed
in
the
way
required
that
this
is
the
way
in
which
metaphysical
writers
start
their
investigations
seems
to
shew
conclusively
that
they
are
influenced
by
the
idea
that
goodness
is
with
being
they
do
not
recognise
that
the
question
what
is
good
is
a
one
from
the
question
what
is
willed
in
a
certain
way
thus
we
find
green
explicitly
stating
that
common
characteristic
of
the
good
is
that
it
satisfies
some
desire
if
we
are
to
take
this
statement
strictly
it
obviously
asserts
that
good
things
have
no
characteristic
in
common
except
that
they
satisfy
some
desire
not
even
therefore
that
they
are
good
and
this
can
only
be
the
case
if
being
good
is
with
satisfying
desire
if
good
is
merely
another
name
for
there
could
be
no
plainer
instance
of
the
naturalistic
fallacy
and
we
can
not
take
the
statement
as
a
mere
verbal
slip
which
does
not
affect
the
validity
of
green
s
main
argument
for
he
nowhere
either
gives
or
pretends
to
give
any
reason
for
believing
anything
to
be
good
in
any
sense
except
that
it
is
what
would
satisfy
a
particular
kind
of
desire
the
kind
of
desire
which
he
tries
to
shew
to
be
that
of
a
moral
agent
an
unhappy
alternative
is
before
us
such
reasoning
would
give
valid
reasons
for
his
conclusions
if
and
only
if
being
good
and
being
desired
in
a
particular
way
were
identical
and
in
this
case
as
we
have
seen
in
chapter
his
conclusions
would
not
be
ethical
on
the
other
hand
if
the
two
are
not
identical
his
conclusions
may
be
ethical
and
may
even
be
right
but
he
has
not
given
us
a
single
reason
for
believing
them
the
thing
which
a
scientific
ethics
is
required
to
shew
namely
that
certain
things
are
really
good
he
has
assumed
to
begin
with
in
assuming
that
things
which
are
willed
in
a
certain
way
are
always
good
we
may
therefore
have
as
much
respect
for
green
s
conclusions
as
for
those
of
any
other
man
who
details
to
us
his
ethical
convictions
but
that
any
of
his
arguments
are
such
as
to
give
us
any
reason
for
holding
that
green
s
convictions
are
more
likely
to
be
true
than
those
of
any
other
man
must
be
clearly
denied
the
to
is
quite
as
far
as
mr
spencer
s
of
from
making
the
smallest
contribution
to
the
solution
of
ethical
problems
to
the
main
object
of
this
chapter
has
been
to
shew
that
metaphysics
understood
as
the
investigation
of
a
supposed
supersensible
reality
can
have
no
logical
bearing
whatever
upon
the
answer
to
the
fundamental
ethical
question
what
is
good
in
itself
that
this
is
so
follows
at
once
from
the
conclusion
of
chapter
that
good
denotes
an
ultimate
unanalysable
predicate
but
this
truth
has
been
so
systematically
ignored
that
it
seemed
worth
while
to
discuss
and
distinguish
in
detail
the
principal
relations
which
do
hold
or
have
been
supposed
to
hold
between
metaphysics
and
ethics
with
this
view
i
pointed
out
that
metaphysics
may
have
a
bearing
on
ethics
on
the
question
what
ought
we
to
do
so
far
as
it
may
be
able
to
tell
us
what
the
future
effects
of
our
action
will
be
what
it
can
tell
us
is
whether
those
effects
are
good
or
bad
in
themselves
one
particular
type
of
metaphysical
doctrine
which
is
very
frequently
held
undoubtedly
has
such
a
bearing
on
ethics
for
if
it
is
true
that
the
sole
reality
is
an
eternal
immutable
absolute
then
it
follows
that
no
actions
of
ours
can
have
any
real
effect
and
hence
that
no
proposition
can
be
true
the
same
conclusion
follows
from
the
ethical
proposition
commonly
combined
with
this
metaphysical
one
namely
that
this
eternal
reality
is
also
the
sole
good
that
metaphysical
writers
as
where
they
fail
to
notice
the
contradiction
just
noticed
between
any
proposition
and
the
assertion
that
an
eternal
reality
is
the
sole
good
seem
frequently
to
confuse
the
proposition
that
one
particular
existing
thing
is
good
with
the
proposition
that
the
existence
of
that
kind
of
thing
be
good
wherever
it
might
occur
to
the
proof
of
the
former
proposition
metaphysics
might
be
relevant
by
shewing
that
the
thing
existed
to
the
proof
of
the
latter
it
is
wholly
irrelevant
it
can
only
serve
the
function
of
suggesting
things
which
may
be
valuable
a
function
which
would
be
still
better
performed
by
pure
fiction
but
the
most
important
source
of
the
supposition
that
metaphysics
is
relevant
to
ethics
seems
to
be
the
assumption
that
good
denote
some
property
of
things
an
assumption
which
is
mainly
due
to
two
erroneous
doctrines
the
first
the
second
hence
i
discussed
the
doctrine
that
all
propositions
assert
a
relation
between
existents
and
pointed
out
that
the
assimilation
of
ethical
propositions
either
to
natural
laws
or
to
commands
are
instances
of
this
fallacy
and
finally
i
discussed
the
doctrine
that
to
be
good
is
equivalent
to
being
willed
or
felt
in
some
particular
way
a
doctrine
which
derives
support
from
the
analogous
error
which
kant
regarded
as
the
cardinal
point
of
his
system
and
which
has
received
immensely
wide
acceptance
the
erroneous
view
that
to
be
true
or
real
is
equivalent
to
being
thought
in
a
particular
way
in
this
discussion
the
main
points
to
which
i
desire
to
direct
attention
are
these
that
volition
and
feeling
are
analogous
to
cognition
in
the
manner
assumed
since
in
so
far
as
these
words
denote
an
attitude
of
the
mind
towards
an
object
they
are
themselves
merely
instances
of
cognition
they
differ
only
in
respect
of
the
kind
of
object
of
which
they
take
cognisance
and
in
respect
of
the
other
mental
accompaniments
of
such
cognitions
that
universally
the
of
a
cognition
must
be
distinguished
from
the
cognition
of
which
it
is
the
object
and
hence
that
in
no
case
can
the
question
whether
the
object
is
be
identical
with
the
question
how
it
is
cognised
or
whether
it
is
cognised
at
all
it
follows
that
even
if
the
proposition
this
is
good
were
always
the
object
of
certain
kinds
of
will
or
feeling
the
of
that
proposition
could
in
no
case
be
established
by
proving
that
it
was
their
object
far
less
can
that
proposition
itself
be
identical
with
the
proposition
that
its
subject
is
the
object
of
a
volition
or
a
feeling
chapter
ethics
in
relation
to
conduct
in
the
present
chapter
we
have
again
to
take
a
great
step
in
ethical
method
my
discussion
hitherto
has
fallen
under
two
main
heads
under
the
first
i
tried
to
shew
what
good
the
adjective
good
this
appeared
to
be
the
first
point
to
be
settled
in
any
treatment
of
ethics
that
should
aim
at
being
systematic
it
is
necessary
we
should
know
this
should
know
what
good
means
before
we
can
go
on
to
consider
what
is
good
what
things
or
qualities
are
good
it
is
necessary
we
should
know
it
for
two
reasons
the
first
reason
is
that
good
is
the
notion
upon
which
all
ethics
depends
we
can
not
hope
to
understand
what
we
mean
when
we
say
that
this
is
good
or
that
is
good
until
we
understand
quite
clearly
not
only
what
this
is
or
that
is
which
the
natural
sciences
and
philosophy
can
tell
us
but
also
what
is
meant
by
calling
them
good
a
matter
which
is
reserved
for
ethics
only
unless
we
are
quite
clear
on
this
point
our
ethical
reasoning
will
be
always
apt
to
be
fallacious
we
shall
think
that
we
are
proving
that
a
thing
is
good
when
we
are
really
only
proving
that
it
is
something
else
since
unless
we
know
what
good
means
unless
we
know
what
is
meant
by
that
notion
in
itself
as
distinct
from
what
is
meant
by
any
other
notion
we
shall
not
be
able
to
tell
when
we
are
dealing
with
it
and
when
we
are
dealing
with
something
else
which
is
perhaps
like
it
but
yet
not
the
same
and
the
second
reason
why
we
should
settle
first
of
all
this
question
what
good
means
is
a
reason
of
method
it
is
this
that
we
can
never
know
on
what
an
ethical
proposition
rests
until
we
know
the
nature
of
the
notion
which
makes
the
proposition
ethical
we
can
not
tell
what
is
possible
by
way
of
proof
in
favour
of
one
judgment
that
this
or
that
is
good
or
against
another
judgment
that
this
or
that
is
bad
until
we
have
recognised
what
the
nature
of
such
propositions
must
always
be
in
fact
it
follows
from
the
meaning
of
good
and
bad
that
such
propositions
are
all
of
them
in
kant
s
phrase
synthetic
they
all
must
rest
in
the
end
upon
some
proposition
which
must
be
simply
accepted
or
rejected
which
can
not
be
logically
deduced
from
any
other
proposition
this
result
which
follows
from
our
first
investigation
may
be
otherwise
expressed
by
saying
that
the
fundamental
principles
of
ethics
must
be
but
i
am
anxious
that
this
expression
should
not
be
misunderstood
the
expression
means
properly
that
the
proposition
so
called
is
evident
or
true
alone
that
it
is
not
an
inference
from
some
proposition
other
than
the
expression
does
mean
that
the
proposition
is
true
because
it
is
evident
to
you
or
me
or
all
mankind
because
in
other
words
it
appears
to
us
to
be
true
that
a
proposition
appears
to
be
true
can
never
be
a
valid
argument
that
true
it
really
is
by
saying
that
a
proposition
is
we
mean
emphatically
that
its
appearing
so
to
us
is
the
reason
why
it
is
true
for
we
mean
that
it
has
absolutely
no
reason
it
would
not
be
a
proposition
if
we
could
say
of
it
i
can
not
think
otherwise
and
therefore
it
is
true
for
then
its
evidence
or
proof
would
not
lie
in
itself
but
in
something
else
namely
our
conviction
of
it
that
it
appears
true
to
us
may
indeed
be
the
of
our
asserting
it
or
the
reason
why
we
think
and
say
that
it
is
true
but
a
reason
in
this
sense
is
something
utterly
different
from
a
logical
reason
or
reason
why
something
is
true
moreover
it
is
obviously
not
a
reason
of
the
same
thing
the
of
a
proposition
to
us
is
only
a
reason
for
holding
to
be
true
whereas
a
logical
reason
or
reason
in
the
sense
in
which
propositions
have
no
reason
is
a
reason
why
proposition
must
be
true
not
why
we
hold
it
so
to
be
again
that
a
proposition
is
evident
to
us
may
not
only
be
the
reason
why
we
do
think
or
affirm
it
it
may
even
be
a
why
we
ought
to
think
it
or
affirm
it
but
a
reason
in
this
sense
too
is
not
a
logical
reason
for
the
truth
of
the
proposition
though
it
is
a
logical
reason
for
the
rightness
of
holding
the
proposition
in
our
common
language
however
these
three
meanings
of
reason
are
constantly
confused
whenever
we
say
i
have
a
reason
for
thinking
that
but
it
is
absolutely
essential
if
we
are
to
get
clear
notions
about
ethics
or
indeed
about
any
other
especially
any
philosophical
study
that
we
should
distinguish
them
when
therefore
i
talk
of
intuitionistic
hedonism
i
must
not
be
understood
to
imply
that
my
denial
that
pleasure
is
the
only
good
is
on
my
intuition
of
its
falsehood
my
intuition
of
its
falsehood
is
indeed
reason
for
and
declaring
it
untrue
it
is
indeed
the
only
valid
reason
for
so
doing
but
that
is
just
because
there
is
logical
reason
for
it
because
there
is
no
proper
evidence
or
reason
of
its
falsehood
except
itself
alone
it
is
untrue
because
it
is
untrue
and
there
is
no
other
reason
but
i
it
untrue
because
its
untruth
is
evident
to
me
and
i
hold
that
that
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
my
assertion
we
must
not
therefore
look
on
intuition
as
if
it
were
an
alternative
to
reasoning
nothing
whatever
can
take
the
place
of
for
the
truth
of
any
proposition
intuition
can
only
furnish
a
reason
for
any
proposition
to
be
true
this
however
it
must
do
when
any
proposition
is
when
in
fact
there
are
no
reasons
which
prove
its
truth
so
much
then
for
the
first
step
in
our
ethical
method
the
step
which
established
that
good
is
good
and
nothing
else
whatever
and
that
naturalism
was
a
fallacy
a
second
step
was
taken
when
we
began
to
consider
proposed
principles
of
ethics
in
this
second
division
resting
on
our
result
that
good
means
good
we
began
the
discussion
of
propositions
asserting
that
such
and
such
a
thing
or
quality
or
concept
was
good
of
such
a
kind
was
the
principle
of
intuitionistic
or
ethical
hedonism
the
principle
that
pleasure
alone
is
following
the
method
established
by
our
first
discussion
i
claimed
that
the
untruth
of
this
proposition
was
i
could
do
nothing
to
that
it
was
untrue
i
could
only
point
out
as
clearly
as
possible
what
it
means
and
how
it
contradicts
other
propositions
which
appear
to
be
equally
true
my
only
object
in
all
this
was
necessarily
to
convince
but
even
if
i
did
convince
that
does
not
prove
that
we
are
right
it
justifies
us
in
that
we
are
so
but
nevertheless
we
may
be
wrong
on
one
thing
however
we
may
justly
pride
ourselves
it
is
that
we
have
had
a
better
chance
of
answering
our
question
rightly
than
bentham
or
mill
or
sidgwick
or
others
who
have
contradicted
us
for
we
have
that
these
have
never
even
asked
themselves
the
question
which
they
professed
to
answer
they
have
confused
it
with
another
question
small
wonder
therefore
if
their
answer
is
different
from
ours
we
must
be
quite
sure
that
the
same
question
has
been
put
before
we
trouble
ourselves
at
the
different
answers
that
are
given
to
it
for
all
we
know
the
whole
world
would
agree
with
us
if
they
could
once
clearly
understand
the
question
upon
which
we
want
their
votes
certain
it
is
that
in
all
those
cases
where
we
found
a
difference
of
opinion
we
found
also
that
the
question
had
been
clearly
understood
though
therefore
we
can
not
prove
that
we
are
right
yet
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
everybody
unless
he
is
mistaken
as
to
what
he
thinks
will
think
the
same
as
we
it
is
as
with
a
sum
in
mathematics
if
we
find
a
gross
and
palpable
error
in
the
calculations
we
are
not
surprised
or
troubled
that
the
person
who
made
this
mistake
has
reached
a
different
result
from
ours
we
think
he
will
admit
that
his
result
is
wrong
if
his
mistake
is
pointed
out
to
him
for
instance
if
a
man
has
to
add
up
we
should
not
wonder
that
he
made
the
result
to
be
if
he
started
by
making
and
so
in
ethics
if
we
find
as
we
did
that
desirable
is
confused
with
desired
or
that
end
is
confused
with
means
we
need
not
be
disconcerted
that
those
who
have
committed
these
mistakes
do
not
agree
with
us
the
only
difference
is
that
in
ethics
owing
to
the
intricacy
of
its
it
is
far
more
difficult
to
persuade
anyone
either
that
he
has
made
a
mistake
or
that
that
mistake
affects
his
result
in
this
second
division
of
my
subject
the
division
which
is
occupied
with
the
question
what
is
good
in
itself
i
have
hitherto
only
tried
to
establish
one
definite
result
and
that
a
negative
one
namely
that
pleasure
is
the
sole
good
this
result
if
true
refutes
half
or
more
than
half
of
the
ethical
theories
which
have
ever
been
held
and
is
therefore
not
without
importance
it
will
however
be
necessary
presently
to
deal
positively
with
the
question
what
things
are
good
and
in
what
degrees
but
before
proceeding
to
this
discussion
i
propose
first
to
deal
with
the
kind
of
ethical
question
the
question
what
ought
we
to
do
the
answering
of
this
question
constitutes
the
third
great
division
of
ethical
enquiry
and
its
nature
was
briefly
explained
in
chap
i
it
introduces
into
ethics
as
was
there
pointed
out
an
entirely
new
question
the
question
what
things
are
related
as
to
that
which
is
good
in
itself
and
this
question
can
only
be
answered
by
an
entirely
new
method
the
method
of
empirical
investigation
by
means
of
which
causes
are
discovered
in
the
other
sciences
to
ask
what
kind
of
actions
we
ought
to
perform
or
what
kind
of
conduct
is
right
is
to
ask
what
kind
of
effects
such
action
and
conduct
will
produce
not
a
single
question
in
practical
ethics
can
be
answered
except
by
a
causal
generalisation
all
such
questions
do
indeed
involve
an
ethical
judgment
proper
the
judgment
that
certain
effects
are
better
in
themselves
than
others
but
they
assert
that
these
better
things
are
effects
are
causally
connected
with
the
actions
in
question
every
judgment
in
practical
ethics
may
be
reduced
to
the
form
this
is
a
cause
of
that
good
thing
that
this
is
the
case
that
the
questions
what
is
right
what
is
my
duty
what
ought
i
to
do
belong
exclusively
to
this
third
branch
of
ethical
enquiry
is
the
first
point
to
which
i
wish
to
call
attention
all
moral
laws
i
wish
to
shew
are
merely
statements
that
certain
kinds
of
actions
will
have
good
effects
the
very
opposite
of
this
view
has
been
generally
prevalent
in
ethics
the
right
and
the
useful
have
been
supposed
to
be
at
least
of
conflicting
with
one
another
and
at
all
events
to
be
essentially
distinct
it
has
been
characteristic
of
a
certain
school
of
moralists
as
of
moral
common
sense
to
declare
that
the
end
will
never
justify
the
means
what
i
wish
first
to
point
out
is
that
right
does
and
can
mean
nothing
but
cause
of
a
good
result
and
is
thus
identical
with
useful
whence
it
follows
that
the
end
always
will
justify
the
means
and
that
no
action
which
is
not
justified
by
its
results
can
be
right
that
there
may
be
a
true
proposition
meant
to
be
conveyed
by
the
assertion
the
end
will
not
justify
the
means
i
fully
admit
but
that
in
another
sense
and
a
sense
far
more
fundamental
for
ethical
theory
it
is
utterly
false
must
first
be
shewn
that
the
assertion
i
am
morally
bound
to
perform
this
action
is
identical
with
the
assertion
this
action
will
produce
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
good
in
the
universe
has
already
been
briefly
shewn
in
chap
i
but
it
is
important
to
insist
that
this
fundamental
point
is
demonstrably
certain
this
may
perhaps
be
best
made
evident
in
the
following
way
it
is
plain
that
when
we
assert
that
a
certain
action
is
our
absolute
duty
we
are
asserting
that
the
performance
of
that
action
at
that
time
is
unique
in
respect
of
value
but
no
dutiful
action
can
possibly
have
unique
value
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
sole
thing
of
value
in
the
world
since
in
that
case
such
action
would
be
the
good
thing
which
is
a
manifest
contradiction
and
for
the
same
reason
its
value
can
not
be
unique
in
the
sense
that
it
has
more
intrinsic
value
than
anything
else
in
the
world
since
act
of
duty
would
then
be
the
thing
in
the
world
which
is
also
a
contradiction
it
can
therefore
be
unique
only
in
the
sense
that
the
whole
world
will
be
better
if
it
be
performed
than
if
any
possible
alternative
were
taken
and
the
question
whether
this
is
so
can
not
possibly
depend
solely
on
the
question
of
its
own
intrinsic
value
for
any
action
will
also
have
effects
different
from
those
of
any
other
action
and
if
any
of
these
have
intrinsic
value
their
value
is
exactly
as
relevant
to
the
total
goodness
of
the
universe
as
that
of
their
cause
it
is
in
fact
evident
that
however
valuable
an
action
may
be
in
itself
yet
owing
to
its
existence
the
sum
of
good
in
the
universe
may
conceivably
be
made
less
than
if
some
other
action
less
valuable
in
itself
had
been
performed
but
to
say
that
this
is
the
case
is
to
say
that
it
would
have
been
better
that
the
action
should
not
have
been
done
and
this
again
is
obviously
equivalent
to
the
statement
that
it
ought
not
to
have
been
done
that
it
was
not
what
duty
required
fiat
iustitia
ruat
caelum
can
only
be
justified
on
the
ground
that
by
the
doing
of
justice
the
universe
gains
more
than
it
loses
by
the
falling
of
the
heavens
it
is
of
course
possible
that
this
is
the
case
but
at
all
events
to
assert
that
justice
a
duty
in
spite
of
such
consequences
is
to
assert
that
it
is
the
case
our
duty
therefore
can
only
be
defined
as
that
action
which
will
cause
more
good
to
exist
in
the
universe
than
any
possible
alternative
and
what
is
right
or
morally
permissible
only
differs
from
this
as
what
will
cause
good
than
any
possible
alternative
when
therefore
ethics
presumes
to
assert
that
certain
ways
of
acting
are
duties
it
presumes
to
assert
that
to
act
in
those
ways
will
always
produce
the
greatest
possible
sum
of
good
if
we
are
told
that
to
do
no
murder
is
a
duty
we
are
told
that
the
action
whatever
it
may
be
which
is
called
murder
will
under
no
circumstances
cause
so
much
good
to
exist
in
the
universe
as
its
avoidance
but
if
this
be
recognised
several
most
important
consequences
follow
with
regard
to
the
relation
of
ethics
to
conduct
it
is
plain
that
no
moral
law
is
as
has
commonly
been
held
by
the
intuitional
school
of
moralists
the
intuitional
view
of
ethics
consists
in
the
supposition
that
certain
rules
stating
that
certain
actions
are
always
to
be
done
or
to
be
omitted
may
be
taken
as
premisses
i
have
shewn
with
regard
to
judgments
of
what
is
in
that
this
is
the
case
no
reason
can
be
given
for
them
but
it
is
the
essence
of
intuitionism
to
suppose
that
rules
of
action
statements
not
of
what
ought
to
but
of
what
we
ought
to
do
are
in
the
same
sense
intuitively
certain
plausibility
has
been
lent
to
this
view
by
the
fact
that
we
do
undoubtedly
make
immediate
judgments
that
certain
actions
are
obligatory
or
wrong
we
are
thus
often
intuitively
certain
of
our
duty
a
psychological
but
nevertheless
these
judgments
are
not
and
can
not
be
taken
as
ethical
premisses
since
as
has
now
been
shewn
they
are
capable
of
being
confirmed
or
refuted
by
an
investigation
of
causes
and
effects
it
is
indeed
possible
that
some
of
our
immediate
intuitions
are
true
but
since
we
intuit
conscience
tells
us
is
that
certain
actions
will
always
produce
the
greatest
sum
of
good
possible
under
the
circumstances
it
is
plain
that
reasons
can
be
given
which
will
shew
the
deliverances
of
conscience
to
be
true
or
false
in
order
to
shew
that
any
action
is
a
duty
it
is
necessary
to
know
both
what
are
the
other
conditions
which
will
conjointly
with
it
determine
its
effects
to
know
exactly
what
will
be
the
effects
of
these
conditions
and
to
know
all
the
events
which
will
be
in
any
way
affected
by
our
action
throughout
an
infinite
future
we
must
have
all
this
causal
knowledge
and
further
we
must
know
accurately
the
degree
of
value
both
of
the
action
itself
and
of
all
these
effects
and
must
be
able
to
determine
how
in
conjunction
with
the
other
things
in
the
universe
they
will
affect
its
value
as
an
organic
whole
and
not
only
this
we
must
also
possess
all
this
knowledge
with
regard
to
the
effects
of
every
possible
alternative
and
must
then
be
able
to
see
by
comparison
that
the
total
value
due
to
the
existence
of
the
action
in
question
will
be
greater
than
that
which
would
be
produced
by
any
of
these
alternatives
but
it
is
obvious
that
our
causal
knowledge
alone
is
far
too
incomplete
for
us
ever
to
assure
ourselves
of
this
result
accordingly
it
follows
that
we
never
have
any
reason
to
suppose
that
an
action
is
our
duty
we
can
never
be
sure
that
any
action
will
produce
the
greatest
value
possible
ethics
therefore
is
quite
unable
to
give
us
a
list
of
duties
but
there
still
remains
a
humbler
task
which
may
be
possible
for
practical
ethics
although
we
can
not
hope
to
discover
which
in
a
given
situation
is
the
best
of
all
possible
alternative
actions
there
may
be
some
possibility
of
shewing
which
among
the
alternatives
to
occur
to
any
will
produce
the
greatest
sum
of
good
this
second
task
is
certainly
all
that
ethics
can
ever
have
accomplished
and
it
is
certainly
all
that
it
has
ever
collected
materials
for
proving
since
no
one
has
ever
attempted
to
exhaust
the
possible
alternative
actions
in
any
particular
case
ethical
philosophers
have
in
fact
confined
their
attention
to
a
very
limited
class
of
actions
which
have
been
selected
because
they
are
those
which
most
commonly
occur
to
mankind
as
possible
alternatives
with
regard
to
these
they
may
possibly
have
shewn
that
one
alternative
is
better
produces
a
greater
total
of
value
than
others
but
it
seems
desirable
to
insist
that
though
they
have
represented
this
result
as
a
determination
of
it
can
never
really
have
been
so
for
the
term
duty
is
certainly
so
used
that
if
we
are
subsequently
persuaded
that
any
possible
action
would
have
produced
more
good
than
the
one
we
adopted
we
admit
that
we
failed
to
do
our
duty
it
will
however
be
a
useful
task
if
ethics
can
determine
which
among
alternatives
to
will
produce
the
greatest
total
value
for
though
this
alternative
can
not
be
proved
to
be
the
best
possible
yet
it
may
be
better
than
any
course
of
action
which
we
should
otherwise
adopt
a
difficulty
in
distinguishing
this
task
which
ethics
may
perhaps
undertake
with
some
hope
of
success
from
the
hopeless
task
of
finding
duties
arises
from
an
ambiguity
in
the
use
of
the
term
an
action
may
in
one
perfectly
legitimate
sense
be
said
to
be
impossible
solely
because
the
idea
of
doing
it
does
not
occur
to
us
in
this
sense
then
the
alternatives
which
do
actually
occur
to
a
man
would
be
the
only
alternatives
and
the
best
of
these
would
be
the
best
possible
action
under
the
circumstances
and
hence
would
conform
to
our
definition
of
but
when
we
talk
of
the
best
action
as
our
duty
we
mean
by
the
term
any
action
which
no
known
circumstance
would
prevent
the
idea
of
it
occurred
to
us
and
this
use
of
the
term
is
in
accordance
with
popular
usage
for
we
admit
that
a
man
may
fail
to
do
his
duty
through
neglecting
to
think
of
what
he
have
done
since
therefore
we
say
that
he
have
done
what
nevertheless
did
not
occur
to
him
it
is
plain
that
we
do
not
limit
his
actions
to
those
of
which
he
thinks
it
might
be
urged
with
more
plausibility
that
we
mean
by
a
man
s
duty
only
the
best
of
those
actions
of
which
he
have
thought
and
it
is
true
that
we
do
not
blame
any
man
very
severely
for
omitting
an
action
of
which
as
we
say
he
could
not
be
expected
to
but
even
here
it
is
plain
that
we
recognise
a
distinction
between
what
he
might
have
done
and
what
he
might
have
thought
of
doing
we
regard
it
as
a
pity
that
he
did
not
do
otherwise
and
duty
is
certainly
used
in
such
a
sense
that
it
would
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
to
say
it
was
a
pity
that
a
man
did
his
duty
we
must
therefore
distinguish
a
possible
action
from
an
action
of
which
it
is
possible
to
think
by
the
former
we
mean
an
action
which
no
known
cause
would
prevent
the
idea
of
it
occurred
to
us
and
that
one
among
such
actions
which
will
produce
the
greatest
total
good
is
what
we
mean
by
duty
ethics
certainly
can
not
hope
to
discover
what
kind
of
action
is
always
our
duty
in
this
sense
it
may
however
hope
to
decide
which
among
one
or
two
such
possible
actions
is
the
best
and
those
which
it
has
chosen
to
consider
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
most
important
of
those
with
regard
to
which
men
deliberate
whether
they
shall
or
shall
not
do
them
a
decision
with
regard
to
these
may
therefore
be
easily
confounded
with
a
decision
with
regard
to
which
is
the
best
possible
action
but
it
is
to
be
noted
that
even
though
we
limit
ourselves
to
considering
which
is
the
better
among
alternatives
likely
to
be
thought
of
the
fact
that
these
alternatives
might
be
thought
of
is
not
included
is
what
we
mean
by
calling
them
possible
alternatives
even
if
in
any
particular
case
it
was
impossible
that
the
idea
of
them
should
have
occurred
to
a
man
the
question
we
are
concerned
with
is
which
if
it
had
occurred
would
have
been
the
best
alternative
if
we
say
that
murder
is
always
a
worse
alternative
we
mean
to
assert
that
it
is
so
even
where
it
was
impossible
for
the
murderer
to
think
of
doing
anything
else
the
utmost
then
that
practical
ethics
can
hope
to
discover
is
which
among
a
few
alternatives
possible
under
certain
circumstances
will
on
the
whole
produce
the
best
result
it
may
tell
us
which
is
the
best
in
this
sense
of
certain
alternatives
about
which
we
are
likely
to
deliberate
and
since
we
may
also
know
that
even
if
we
choose
none
of
these
what
we
shall
in
that
case
do
is
unlikely
to
be
as
good
as
one
of
them
it
may
thus
tell
us
which
of
the
alternatives
among
which
we
choose
it
is
best
to
choose
if
it
could
do
this
it
would
be
sufficient
for
practical
guidance
but
it
is
plain
that
even
this
is
a
task
of
immense
difficulty
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
we
can
establish
even
a
probability
that
by
doing
one
thing
we
shall
obtain
a
better
total
result
than
by
doing
another
i
shall
merely
endeavour
to
point
out
how
much
is
assumed
when
we
assume
that
there
is
such
a
probability
and
on
what
lines
it
seems
possible
that
this
assumption
may
be
justified
it
will
be
apparent
that
it
has
never
yet
been
justified
that
no
sufficient
reason
has
ever
yet
been
found
for
considering
one
action
more
right
or
more
wrong
than
another
the
first
difficulty
in
the
way
of
establishing
a
probability
that
one
course
of
action
will
give
a
better
total
result
than
another
lies
in
the
fact
that
we
have
to
take
account
of
the
effects
of
both
throughout
an
infinite
future
we
have
no
certainty
but
that
if
we
do
one
action
now
the
universe
will
throughout
all
time
differ
in
some
way
from
what
it
would
have
been
if
we
had
done
another
and
if
there
is
such
a
permanent
difference
it
is
certainly
relevant
to
our
calculation
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
our
causal
knowledge
is
utterly
insufficient
to
tell
us
what
different
effects
will
probably
result
from
two
different
actions
except
within
a
comparatively
short
space
of
time
we
can
certainly
only
pretend
to
calculate
the
effects
of
actions
within
what
may
be
called
an
immediate
future
no
one
when
he
proceeds
upon
what
he
considers
a
rational
consideration
of
effects
would
guide
his
choice
by
any
forecast
that
went
beyond
a
few
centuries
at
most
and
in
general
we
consider
that
we
have
acted
rationally
if
we
think
we
have
secured
a
balance
of
good
within
a
few
years
or
months
or
days
yet
if
a
choice
guided
by
such
considerations
is
to
be
rational
we
must
certainly
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
no
consequences
of
our
action
in
a
further
future
will
generally
be
such
as
to
reverse
the
balance
of
good
that
is
probable
in
the
future
which
we
can
foresee
this
large
postulate
must
be
made
if
we
are
ever
to
assert
that
the
results
of
one
action
will
be
even
probably
better
than
those
of
another
our
utter
ignorance
of
the
far
future
gives
us
no
justification
for
saying
that
it
is
even
probably
right
to
choose
the
greater
good
within
the
region
over
which
a
probable
forecast
may
extend
we
do
then
assume
that
it
is
improbable
that
effects
after
a
certain
time
will
in
general
be
such
as
to
reverse
the
comparative
value
of
the
alternative
results
within
that
time
and
that
this
assumption
is
justified
must
be
shewn
before
we
can
claim
to
have
given
any
reason
whatever
for
acting
in
one
way
rather
than
in
another
it
may
perhaps
be
justified
by
some
such
considerations
as
the
following
as
we
proceed
further
and
further
from
the
time
at
which
alternative
actions
are
open
to
us
the
events
of
which
either
action
would
be
part
cause
become
increasingly
dependent
on
those
other
circumstances
which
are
the
same
whichever
action
we
adopt
the
effects
of
any
individual
action
seem
after
a
sufficient
space
of
time
to
be
found
only
in
trifling
modifications
spread
over
a
very
wide
area
whereas
its
immediate
effects
consist
in
some
prominent
modification
of
a
comparatively
narrow
area
since
however
most
of
the
things
which
have
any
great
importance
for
good
or
evil
are
things
of
this
prominent
kind
there
may
be
a
probability
that
after
a
certain
time
all
the
effects
of
any
particular
action
become
so
nearly
indifferent
that
any
difference
between
their
value
and
that
of
the
effects
of
another
action
is
very
unlikely
to
outweigh
an
obvious
difference
in
the
value
of
the
immediate
effects
it
does
in
fact
appear
to
be
the
case
that
in
most
cases
whatever
action
we
now
adopt
it
will
be
all
the
same
a
hundred
years
hence
so
far
as
the
existence
at
that
time
of
anything
greatly
good
or
bad
is
concerned
and
this
might
perhaps
be
to
be
true
by
an
investigation
of
the
manner
in
which
the
effects
of
any
particular
event
become
neutralised
by
lapse
of
time
failing
such
a
proof
we
can
certainly
have
no
rational
ground
for
asserting
that
one
of
two
alternatives
is
even
probably
right
and
another
wrong
if
any
of
our
judgments
of
right
and
wrong
are
to
pretend
to
probability
we
must
have
reason
to
think
that
the
effects
of
our
actions
in
the
far
future
will
not
have
value
sufficient
to
outweigh
any
superiority
of
one
set
of
effects
over
another
in
the
immediate
future
we
must
assume
then
that
if
the
effects
of
one
action
are
generally
better
than
those
of
another
so
far
forward
in
the
future
as
we
are
able
to
foresee
any
probable
difference
in
their
effects
at
all
then
the
total
effect
upon
the
universe
of
the
former
action
is
also
generally
better
we
certainly
can
not
hope
directly
to
compare
their
effects
except
within
a
limited
future
and
all
the
arguments
which
have
ever
been
used
in
ethics
and
upon
which
we
commonly
act
in
common
life
directed
to
shewing
that
one
course
is
superior
to
another
are
apart
from
theological
dogmas
confined
to
pointing
out
such
probable
immediate
advantages
the
question
remains
then
can
we
lay
down
any
general
rules
to
the
effect
that
one
among
a
few
alternative
actions
will
generally
produce
a
greater
total
of
good
in
the
immediate
future
it
is
important
to
insist
that
this
question
limited
as
it
is
is
the
utmost
to
which
with
any
knowledge
we
have
at
present
or
are
likely
to
have
for
a
long
time
to
come
practical
ethics
can
hope
to
give
an
answer
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
we
can
not
hope
to
discover
which
is
the
possible
alternative
in
any
given
circumstances
but
only
which
among
a
few
is
better
than
the
others
and
i
have
also
pointed
out
that
there
is
certainly
no
more
than
a
probability
even
if
we
are
entitled
to
assert
so
much
that
what
is
better
in
regard
to
its
immediate
effects
will
also
be
better
on
the
whole
it
now
remains
to
insist
that
even
with
regard
to
these
immediate
effects
we
can
only
hope
to
discover
which
among
a
few
alternatives
will
produce
the
greatest
balance
of
good
in
the
immediate
future
we
can
secure
no
title
to
assert
that
obedience
to
such
commands
as
thou
shalt
not
lie
or
even
thou
shalt
do
no
murder
is
better
than
the
alternatives
of
lying
and
murder
reasons
why
no
more
than
a
knowledge
is
possible
have
been
already
given
in
chap
i
but
they
may
be
recapitulated
here
in
the
first
place
of
the
effects
which
principally
concern
us
in
ethical
discussions
as
having
intrinsic
value
we
know
the
causes
so
little
that
we
can
scarcely
claim
with
regard
to
any
single
one
to
have
obtained
even
a
universal
law
such
as
has
been
obtained
in
the
exact
sciences
we
can
not
even
say
if
this
action
is
performed
under
exactly
these
circumstances
and
if
no
others
interfere
this
important
effect
at
least
will
be
produced
but
in
the
second
place
an
ethical
law
is
not
merely
hypothetical
if
we
are
to
know
that
it
will
always
be
better
to
act
in
a
certain
way
under
certain
circumstances
we
must
know
not
merely
what
effects
such
actions
will
produce
no
other
circumstances
interfere
but
also
that
no
other
circumstances
will
interfere
and
this
it
is
obviously
impossible
to
know
with
more
than
probability
an
ethical
law
has
the
nature
not
of
a
scientific
law
but
of
a
scientific
and
the
latter
is
always
merely
probable
although
the
probability
may
be
very
great
an
engineer
is
entitled
to
assert
that
if
a
bridge
be
built
in
a
certain
way
it
will
probably
bear
certain
loads
for
a
certain
time
but
he
can
never
be
absolutely
certain
that
it
has
been
built
in
the
way
required
nor
that
even
if
it
has
some
accident
will
not
intervene
to
falsify
his
prediction
with
any
ethical
law
the
same
must
be
the
case
it
can
be
no
more
than
a
generalisation
and
here
owing
to
the
comparative
absence
of
accurate
hypothetical
knowledge
on
which
the
prediction
should
be
based
the
probability
is
comparatively
small
but
finally
for
an
ethical
generalisation
we
require
to
know
not
only
what
effects
will
be
produced
but
also
what
are
the
comparative
values
of
those
effects
and
on
this
question
too
it
must
be
admitted
considering
what
a
prevalent
opinion
hedonism
has
been
that
we
are
very
liable
to
be
mistaken
it
is
plain
then
that
we
are
not
soon
likely
to
know
more
than
that
one
kind
of
action
will
produce
better
effects
than
another
and
that
more
than
this
has
certainly
never
been
proved
in
no
two
cases
will
the
effects
of
any
kind
of
action
be
precisely
the
same
because
in
each
case
some
of
the
circumstances
will
differ
and
although
the
effects
that
are
important
for
good
or
evil
may
be
generally
the
same
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
they
will
always
be
so
if
now
we
confine
ourselves
to
a
search
for
actions
which
are
better
as
means
than
any
probable
alternative
it
seems
possible
to
establish
as
much
as
this
in
defence
of
most
of
the
rules
most
universally
recognised
by
common
sense
i
do
not
propose
to
enter
upon
this
defence
in
detail
but
merely
to
point
out
what
seem
to
be
the
chief
distinct
principles
by
the
use
of
which
it
can
be
made
in
the
first
place
then
we
can
only
shew
that
one
action
is
generally
better
than
another
as
a
means
provided
that
certain
other
circumstances
are
given
we
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
observe
its
good
effects
under
certain
circumstances
and
it
may
be
easily
seen
that
a
sufficient
change
in
these
would
render
doubtful
what
seem
the
most
universally
certain
of
general
rules
thus
the
general
disutility
of
murder
can
only
be
proved
provided
the
majority
of
the
human
race
will
certainly
persist
in
existing
in
order
to
prove
that
murder
if
it
were
so
universally
adopted
as
to
cause
the
speedy
extermination
of
the
race
would
not
be
good
as
a
means
we
should
have
to
disprove
the
main
contention
of
pessimism
namely
that
the
existence
of
human
life
is
on
the
whole
an
evil
and
the
view
of
pessimism
however
strongly
we
may
be
convinced
of
its
truth
or
falsehood
is
one
which
never
has
been
either
proved
or
refuted
conclusively
that
universal
murder
would
not
be
a
good
thing
at
this
moment
can
therefore
not
be
proved
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
can
and
do
assume
with
certainty
that
even
if
a
few
people
are
willing
to
murder
most
people
will
not
be
willing
when
therefore
we
say
that
murder
is
in
general
to
be
avoided
we
only
mean
that
it
is
so
so
long
as
the
majority
of
mankind
will
certainly
not
agree
to
it
but
will
persist
in
living
and
that
under
these
circumstances
it
is
generally
wrong
for
any
single
person
to
commit
murder
seems
capable
of
proof
for
since
there
is
in
any
case
no
hope
of
exterminating
the
race
the
only
effects
which
we
have
to
consider
are
those
which
the
action
will
have
upon
the
increase
of
the
goods
and
the
diminution
of
the
evils
of
human
life
where
the
best
is
not
attainable
assuming
extermination
to
be
the
best
one
alternative
may
still
be
better
than
another
and
apart
from
the
immediate
evils
which
murder
generally
produces
the
fact
that
if
it
were
a
common
practice
the
feeling
of
insecurity
thus
caused
would
absorb
much
time
which
might
be
spent
to
better
purpose
is
perhaps
conclusive
against
it
so
long
as
men
desire
to
live
as
strongly
as
they
do
and
so
long
as
it
is
certain
that
they
will
continue
to
do
so
anything
which
hinders
them
from
devoting
their
energy
to
the
attainment
of
positive
goods
seems
plainly
bad
as
a
means
and
the
general
practice
of
murder
falling
so
far
short
of
universality
as
it
certainly
must
in
all
known
conditions
of
society
seems
certainly
to
be
a
hindrance
of
this
kind
a
similar
defence
seems
possible
for
most
of
the
rules
most
universally
enforced
by
legal
sanctions
such
as
respect
of
property
and
for
some
of
those
most
commonly
recognised
by
common
sense
such
as
industry
temperance
and
the
keeping
of
promises
in
any
state
of
society
in
which
men
have
that
intense
desire
for
property
of
some
sort
which
seems
to
be
universal
the
common
legal
rules
for
the
protection
of
property
must
serve
greatly
to
facilitate
the
best
possible
expenditure
of
energy
and
similarly
industry
is
a
means
to
the
attainment
of
those
necessaries
without
which
the
further
attainment
of
any
great
positive
goods
is
impossible
temperance
merely
enjoins
the
avoidance
of
those
excesses
which
by
injuring
health
would
prevent
a
man
from
contributing
as
much
as
possible
to
the
acquirement
of
these
necessaries
and
the
keeping
of
promises
greatly
facilitates
cooperation
in
such
acquirement
now
all
these
rules
seem
to
have
two
characteristics
to
which
it
is
desirable
to
call
attention
they
seem
all
to
be
such
that
in
any
known
state
of
society
a
observance
of
them
be
good
as
a
means
the
conditions
upon
which
their
utility
depends
namely
the
tendency
to
preserve
and
propagate
life
and
the
desire
of
property
seem
to
be
so
universal
and
so
strong
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
remove
them
and
this
being
so
we
can
say
that
under
any
conditions
which
could
actually
be
given
the
general
observance
of
these
rules
would
be
good
as
a
means
for
while
there
seems
no
reason
to
think
that
their
observance
ever
makes
a
society
worse
than
one
in
which
they
are
not
observed
it
is
certainly
necessary
as
a
means
for
any
state
of
things
in
which
the
greatest
possible
goods
can
be
attained
and
these
rules
since
they
can
be
recommended
as
a
means
to
that
which
is
itself
only
a
necessary
condition
for
the
existence
of
any
great
good
can
be
defended
independently
of
correct
views
upon
the
primary
ethical
question
of
what
is
good
in
itself
on
any
view
commonly
taken
it
seems
certain
that
the
preservation
of
civilised
society
which
these
rules
are
necessary
to
effect
is
necessary
for
the
existence
in
any
great
degree
of
anything
which
may
be
held
to
be
good
in
itself
but
not
by
any
means
all
the
rules
commonly
recognised
combine
these
two
characteristics
the
arguments
offered
in
defence
of
common
sense
morality
very
often
presuppose
the
existence
of
conditions
which
can
not
be
fairly
assumed
to
be
so
universally
necessary
as
the
tendency
to
continue
life
and
to
desire
property
such
arguments
accordingly
only
prove
the
utility
of
the
rule
so
long
as
certain
conditions
which
may
alter
remain
the
same
it
can
not
be
claimed
of
the
rules
thus
defended
that
they
would
be
generally
good
as
means
in
every
state
of
society
in
order
to
establish
this
general
utility
it
would
be
necessary
to
arrive
at
a
correct
view
of
what
is
good
or
evil
in
itself
this
for
instance
seems
to
be
the
case
with
most
of
the
rules
comprehended
under
the
name
of
chastity
these
rules
are
commonly
defended
by
utilitarian
writers
or
writers
who
assume
as
their
end
the
conservation
of
society
with
arguments
which
presuppose
the
necessary
existence
of
such
sentiments
as
conjugal
jealousy
and
paternal
affection
these
sentiments
are
no
doubt
sufficiently
strong
and
general
to
make
the
defence
valid
for
many
conditions
of
society
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
a
civilised
society
existing
without
them
and
in
such
a
case
if
chastity
were
still
to
be
defended
it
would
be
necessary
to
establish
that
its
violation
produced
evil
effects
other
than
those
due
to
the
assumed
tendency
of
such
violation
to
disintegrate
society
such
a
defence
may
no
doubt
be
made
but
it
would
require
an
examination
into
the
primary
ethical
question
of
what
is
good
and
bad
in
itself
far
more
thorough
than
any
ethical
writer
has
ever
offered
to
us
whether
this
be
so
in
this
particular
case
or
not
it
is
certain
that
a
distinction
not
commonly
recognised
should
be
made
between
those
rules
of
which
the
social
utility
depends
upon
the
existence
of
circumstances
more
or
less
likely
to
alter
and
those
of
which
the
utility
seems
certain
under
all
possible
conditions
it
is
obvious
that
all
the
rules
which
were
enumerated
above
as
likely
to
be
useful
in
state
of
society
can
be
defended
owing
to
results
which
they
produce
under
conditions
which
exist
only
in
particular
states
of
society
and
it
should
be
noticed
that
we
are
entitled
to
reckon
among
these
conditions
the
sanctions
of
legal
penalties
of
social
disapproval
and
of
private
remorse
where
these
exist
these
sanctions
are
indeed
commonly
treated
by
ethics
only
as
motives
for
the
doing
of
actions
of
which
the
utility
can
be
proved
independently
of
the
existence
of
these
sanctions
and
it
may
be
admitted
that
sanctions
not
to
be
attached
to
actions
which
would
not
be
right
independently
nevertheless
it
is
plain
that
where
they
do
exist
they
are
not
only
motives
but
also
justifications
for
the
actions
in
question
one
of
the
chief
reasons
why
an
action
should
not
be
done
in
any
particular
state
of
society
is
that
it
will
be
punished
since
the
punishment
is
in
general
itself
a
greater
evil
than
would
have
been
caused
by
the
omission
of
the
action
punished
thus
the
existence
of
a
punishment
may
be
an
adequate
reason
for
regarding
an
action
as
generally
wrong
even
though
it
has
no
other
bad
effects
but
even
slightly
good
ones
the
fact
that
an
action
will
be
punished
is
a
condition
of
exactly
the
same
kind
as
others
of
more
or
less
permanence
which
must
be
taken
into
account
in
discussing
the
general
utility
or
disutility
of
an
action
in
a
particular
state
of
society
it
is
plain
then
that
the
rules
commonly
recognised
by
common
sense
in
the
society
in
which
we
live
and
commonly
advocated
as
if
they
were
all
equally
and
universally
right
and
good
are
of
very
different
orders
even
those
which
seem
to
be
most
universally
good
as
means
can
only
be
shewn
to
be
so
because
of
the
existence
of
conditions
which
though
perhaps
evils
may
be
taken
to
be
necessary
and
even
these
owe
their
more
obvious
utilities
to
the
existence
of
other
conditions
which
can
not
be
taken
to
be
necessary
except
over
longer
or
shorter
periods
of
history
and
many
of
which
are
evils
others
seem
to
be
justifiable
by
the
existence
of
such
more
or
less
temporary
conditions
unless
we
abandon
the
attempt
to
shew
that
they
are
means
to
that
preservation
of
society
which
is
itself
a
mere
means
and
are
able
to
establish
that
they
are
directly
means
to
things
good
or
evil
in
themselves
but
which
are
not
commonly
recognised
to
be
such
if
then
we
ask
what
rules
are
or
would
be
useful
to
be
observed
in
the
society
in
which
we
live
it
seems
possible
to
prove
a
definite
utility
in
most
of
those
which
are
in
general
both
recognised
and
practised
but
a
great
part
of
ordinary
moral
exhortation
and
social
discussion
consists
in
the
advocating
of
rules
which
are
generally
practised
and
with
regard
to
these
it
seems
very
doubtful
whether
a
case
for
their
general
utility
can
ever
be
conclusively
made
out
such
proposed
rules
commonly
suffer
from
three
main
defects
in
the
first
place
the
actions
which
they
advocate
are
very
commonly
such
as
it
is
impossible
for
most
individuals
to
perform
by
any
volition
it
is
far
too
usual
to
find
classed
together
with
actions
which
can
be
performed
if
only
they
be
willed
others
of
which
the
possibility
depends
upon
the
possession
of
a
peculiar
disposition
which
is
given
to
few
and
can
not
even
be
acquired
it
may
no
doubt
be
useful
to
point
out
that
those
who
have
the
necessary
disposition
should
obey
these
rules
and
it
would
in
many
cases
be
desirable
that
everybody
should
have
this
disposition
but
it
should
be
recognised
that
when
we
regard
a
thing
as
a
moral
rule
or
law
we
mean
that
it
is
one
which
everybody
observe
by
an
effort
of
volition
in
that
state
of
society
to
which
the
rule
is
supposed
to
apply
actions
are
often
advocated
of
which
though
they
themselves
are
possible
yet
the
proposed
good
effects
are
not
possible
because
the
conditions
necessary
for
their
existence
are
not
sufficiently
general
a
rule
of
which
the
observance
would
produce
good
effects
if
human
nature
were
in
other
respects
different
from
what
it
is
is
advocated
as
if
its
general
observance
would
produce
the
same
effects
now
and
at
once
in
fact
however
by
the
time
that
the
conditions
necessary
to
make
its
observance
useful
have
arisen
it
is
quite
as
likely
that
other
conditions
rendering
its
observance
unnecessary
or
positively
harmful
may
also
have
arisen
and
yet
this
state
of
things
may
be
a
better
one
than
that
in
which
the
rule
in
question
would
have
been
useful
there
also
occurs
the
case
in
which
the
usefulness
of
a
rule
depends
upon
conditions
likely
to
change
or
of
which
the
change
would
be
as
easy
and
more
desirable
than
the
observance
of
the
proposed
rule
it
may
even
happen
that
the
general
observance
of
the
proposed
rule
would
itself
destroy
the
conditions
upon
which
its
utility
depends
one
or
other
of
these
objections
seems
generally
to
apply
to
proposed
changes
in
social
custom
advocated
as
being
better
rules
to
follow
than
those
now
actually
followed
and
for
this
reason
it
seems
doubtful
whether
ethics
can
establish
the
utility
of
any
rules
other
than
those
generally
practised
but
its
inability
to
do
so
is
fortunately
of
little
practical
moment
the
question
whether
the
general
observance
of
a
rule
not
generally
observed
would
or
would
not
be
desirable
can
not
much
affect
the
question
how
any
individual
ought
to
act
since
on
the
one
hand
there
is
a
large
probability
that
he
will
not
by
any
means
be
able
to
bring
about
its
general
observance
and
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
its
general
observance
would
be
useful
could
in
any
case
give
him
no
reason
to
conclude
that
he
himself
ought
to
observe
it
in
the
absence
of
such
general
observance
with
regard
then
to
the
actions
commonly
classed
in
ethics
as
duties
crimes
or
sins
the
following
points
seem
deserving
of
notice
by
so
classing
them
we
mean
that
they
are
actions
which
it
is
possible
for
an
individual
to
perform
or
avoid
if
he
only
to
do
so
and
that
they
are
actions
which
ought
to
perform
or
avoid
when
occasion
arises
we
can
certainly
not
prove
of
any
such
action
that
it
ought
to
be
done
or
avoided
under
circumstances
we
can
only
prove
that
its
performance
or
avoidance
will
produce
better
results
than
the
alternative
if
further
we
ask
of
what
actions
as
much
as
this
can
be
proved
it
seems
only
possible
to
prove
it
with
regard
to
those
which
are
actually
generally
practised
among
us
and
of
these
some
only
are
such
that
their
general
performance
would
be
useful
in
any
state
of
society
that
seems
possible
of
others
the
utility
depends
upon
conditions
which
exist
now
but
which
seem
to
be
more
or
less
alterable
so
much
then
for
moral
rules
or
laws
in
the
ordinary
sense
rules
which
assert
that
it
is
generally
useful
under
more
or
less
common
circumstances
for
to
perform
or
omit
some
definite
kind
of
action
it
remains
to
say
something
with
regard
to
the
principles
by
which
should
decide
what
he
ought
to
do
α
with
regard
to
those
actions
as
to
which
some
general
rule
is
certainly
true
and
β
with
regard
to
those
where
such
a
certain
rule
is
wanting
α
since
as
i
have
tried
to
shew
it
is
impossible
to
establish
that
any
kind
of
action
will
produce
a
better
total
result
than
its
alternative
all
it
follows
that
in
some
cases
the
neglect
of
an
established
rule
will
probably
be
the
best
course
of
action
possible
the
question
then
arises
can
the
individual
ever
be
justified
in
assuming
that
his
is
one
of
these
exceptional
cases
and
it
seems
that
this
question
may
be
definitely
answered
in
the
negative
for
if
it
is
certain
that
in
a
large
majority
of
cases
the
observance
of
a
certain
rule
is
useful
it
follows
that
there
is
a
large
probability
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
break
the
rule
in
any
particular
case
and
the
uncertainty
of
our
knowledge
both
of
effects
and
of
their
value
in
particular
cases
is
so
great
that
it
seems
doubtful
whether
the
individual
s
judgment
that
the
effects
will
probably
be
good
in
his
case
can
ever
be
set
against
the
general
probability
that
that
kind
of
action
is
wrong
added
to
this
general
ignorance
is
the
fact
that
if
the
question
arises
at
all
our
judgment
will
generally
be
biassed
by
the
fact
that
we
strongly
desire
one
of
the
results
which
we
hope
to
obtain
by
breaking
the
rule
it
seems
then
that
with
regard
to
any
rule
which
is
useful
we
may
assert
that
it
ought
to
be
observed
not
on
the
ground
that
in
particular
case
it
will
be
useful
but
on
the
ground
that
in
particular
case
the
probability
of
its
being
so
is
greater
than
that
of
our
being
likely
to
decide
rightly
that
we
have
before
us
an
instance
of
its
disutility
in
short
though
we
may
be
sure
that
there
are
cases
where
the
rule
should
be
broken
we
can
never
know
which
those
cases
are
and
ought
therefore
never
to
break
it
it
is
this
fact
which
seems
to
justify
the
stringency
with
which
moral
rules
are
usually
enforced
and
sanctioned
and
to
give
a
sense
in
which
we
may
accept
as
true
the
maxims
that
the
end
never
justifies
the
means
and
that
we
should
never
do
evil
that
good
may
the
means
and
the
evil
intended
by
these
maxims
are
in
fact
the
breaking
of
moral
rules
generally
recognised
and
practised
and
which
therefore
we
may
assume
to
be
generally
useful
thus
understood
these
maxims
merely
point
out
that
in
any
particular
case
although
we
can
not
clearly
perceive
any
balance
of
good
produced
by
keeping
the
rule
and
do
seem
to
see
one
that
would
follow
from
breaking
it
nevertheless
the
rule
should
be
observed
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
point
out
that
this
is
so
only
because
it
is
certain
that
in
general
the
end
does
justify
the
means
in
question
and
that
therefore
there
is
a
that
in
this
case
it
will
do
so
also
although
we
can
not
see
that
it
will
but
moreover
the
universal
observance
of
a
rule
which
is
generally
useful
has
in
many
cases
a
special
utility
which
seems
deserving
of
notice
this
arises
from
the
fact
that
even
if
we
can
clearly
discern
that
our
case
is
one
where
to
break
the
rule
is
advantageous
yet
so
far
as
our
example
has
any
effect
at
all
in
encouraging
similar
action
it
will
certainly
tend
to
encourage
breaches
of
the
rule
which
are
not
advantageous
we
may
confidently
assume
that
what
will
impress
the
imagination
of
others
will
not
be
the
circumstances
in
which
our
case
differs
from
ordinary
cases
and
which
justify
our
exceptional
action
but
the
points
in
which
it
resembles
other
actions
that
are
really
criminal
in
cases
then
where
example
has
any
influence
at
all
the
effect
of
an
exceptional
right
action
will
generally
be
to
encourage
wrong
ones
and
this
effect
will
probably
be
exercised
not
only
on
other
persons
but
on
the
agent
himself
for
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
to
keep
his
intellect
and
sentiments
so
clear
but
that
if
he
has
once
approved
of
a
generally
wrong
action
he
will
be
more
likely
to
approve
of
it
also
under
other
circumstances
than
those
which
justified
it
in
the
first
instance
this
inability
to
discriminate
exceptional
cases
offers
of
course
a
still
stronger
reason
for
the
universal
enforcement
by
legal
or
social
sanctions
of
actions
generally
useful
it
is
undoubtedly
well
to
punish
a
man
who
has
done
an
action
right
in
his
case
but
generally
wrong
even
if
his
example
would
not
be
likely
to
have
a
dangerous
effect
for
sanctions
have
in
general
much
more
influence
upon
conduct
than
example
so
that
the
effect
of
relaxing
them
in
an
exceptional
case
will
almost
certainly
be
an
encouragement
of
similar
action
in
cases
which
are
not
exceptional
the
individual
can
therefore
be
confidently
recommended
to
conform
to
rules
which
are
both
generally
useful
and
generally
practised
in
the
case
of
rules
of
which
the
general
observance
be
useful
but
does
not
exist
or
of
rules
which
are
generally
practised
but
which
are
not
useful
no
such
universal
recommendations
can
be
made
in
many
cases
the
sanctions
attached
may
be
decisive
in
favour
of
conformity
to
the
existing
custom
but
it
seems
worth
pointing
out
that
even
apart
from
these
the
general
utility
of
an
action
most
commonly
depends
upon
the
fact
that
it
is
generally
practised
in
a
society
where
certain
kinds
of
theft
are
the
common
rule
the
utility
of
abstinence
from
such
theft
on
the
part
of
a
single
individual
becomes
exceedingly
doubtful
even
though
the
common
rule
is
a
bad
one
there
is
therefore
a
strong
probability
in
favour
of
adherence
to
an
existing
custom
even
if
it
be
a
bad
one
but
we
can
not
in
this
case
assert
with
any
confidence
that
this
probability
is
always
greater
than
that
of
the
individual
s
power
to
judge
that
an
exception
will
be
useful
since
we
are
here
supposing
certain
one
relevant
fact
namely
that
the
rule
which
he
proposes
to
follow
be
better
than
that
which
he
proposes
to
break
it
were
generally
observed
consequently
the
effect
of
his
example
so
far
as
it
tends
to
break
down
the
existing
custom
will
here
be
for
the
good
the
cases
where
another
rule
would
certainly
be
better
than
that
generally
observed
are
however
according
to
what
was
said
above
very
rare
and
cases
of
doubt
which
are
those
which
arise
most
frequently
carry
us
into
the
next
division
of
our
subject
β
this
next
division
consists
in
the
discussion
of
the
method
by
which
an
individual
should
decide
what
to
do
with
regard
to
possible
actions
of
which
the
general
utility
can
not
be
proved
and
it
should
be
observed
that
according
to
our
previous
conclusions
this
discussion
will
cover
almost
all
actions
except
those
which
in
our
present
state
of
society
are
generally
practised
for
it
has
been
urged
that
a
proof
of
general
utility
is
so
difficult
that
it
can
hardly
be
conclusive
except
in
a
very
few
cases
it
is
certainly
not
possible
with
regard
to
all
actions
which
generally
practised
though
here
if
the
sanctions
are
sufficiently
strong
they
are
sufficient
by
themselves
to
prove
the
general
utility
of
the
individual
s
conformity
to
custom
and
if
it
is
possible
to
prove
a
general
utility
in
the
case
of
some
actions
generally
practised
it
is
certainly
not
possible
to
do
so
by
the
ordinary
method
which
tries
to
shew
in
them
a
tendency
to
that
preservation
of
society
which
is
itself
a
mere
means
but
only
by
the
method
by
which
in
any
case
as
will
be
urged
the
individual
ought
to
guide
his
judgment
namely
by
shewing
their
direct
tendency
to
produce
what
is
good
in
itself
or
to
prevent
what
is
bad
the
extreme
improbability
that
any
general
rule
with
regard
to
the
utility
of
an
action
will
be
correct
seems
in
fact
to
be
the
chief
principle
which
should
be
taken
into
account
in
discussing
how
the
individual
should
guide
his
choice
if
we
except
those
rules
which
are
both
generally
practised
and
strongly
sanctioned
among
us
there
seem
to
be
hardly
any
of
such
a
kind
that
equally
good
arguments
can
not
be
found
both
for
and
against
them
the
most
that
can
be
said
for
the
contradictory
principles
which
are
urged
by
moralists
of
different
schools
as
universal
duties
is
in
general
that
they
point
out
actions
which
for
persons
of
a
particular
character
and
in
particular
circumstances
would
and
do
lead
to
a
balance
of
good
it
is
no
doubt
possible
that
the
particular
dispositions
and
circumstances
which
generally
render
certain
kinds
of
action
advisable
might
to
some
degree
be
formulated
but
it
is
certain
that
this
has
never
yet
been
done
and
it
is
important
to
notice
that
even
if
it
were
done
it
would
not
give
us
what
moral
laws
are
usually
supposed
to
be
rules
which
it
would
be
desirable
for
every
one
or
even
for
most
people
to
follow
moralists
commonly
assume
that
in
the
matter
of
actions
or
habits
of
action
usually
recognised
as
duties
or
virtues
it
is
desirable
that
every
one
should
be
alike
whereas
it
is
certain
that
under
actual
circumstances
and
possible
that
even
in
a
much
more
ideal
condition
of
things
the
principle
of
division
of
labour
according
to
special
capacity
which
is
recognised
in
respect
of
employments
would
also
give
a
better
result
in
respect
of
virtues
it
seems
therefore
that
in
cases
of
doubt
instead
of
following
rules
of
which
he
is
unable
to
see
the
good
effects
in
his
particular
case
the
individual
should
rather
guide
his
choice
by
a
direct
consideration
of
the
intrinsic
value
or
vileness
of
the
effects
which
his
action
may
produce
judgments
of
intrinsic
value
have
this
superiority
over
judgments
of
means
that
if
once
true
they
are
always
true
whereas
what
is
a
means
to
a
good
effect
in
one
case
will
not
be
so
in
another
for
this
reason
the
department
of
ethics
which
it
would
be
most
useful
to
elaborate
for
practical
guidance
is
that
which
discusses
what
things
have
intrinsic
value
and
in
what
degrees
and
this
is
precisely
that
department
which
has
been
most
uniformly
neglected
in
favour
of
attempts
to
formulate
rules
of
conduct
we
have
however
not
only
to
consider
the
relative
goodness
of
different
effects
but
also
the
relative
probability
of
their
being
attained
a
less
good
that
is
more
likely
to
be
attained
is
to
be
preferred
to
a
greater
that
is
less
probable
if
the
difference
in
probability
is
great
enough
to
outweigh
the
difference
in
goodness
and
this
fact
seems
to
entitle
us
to
assert
the
general
truth
of
three
principles
which
ordinary
moral
rules
are
apt
to
neglect
that
a
lesser
good
for
which
any
individual
has
a
strong
preference
if
only
it
be
a
good
and
not
an
evil
is
more
likely
to
be
a
proper
object
for
him
to
aim
at
than
a
greater
one
which
he
is
unable
to
appreciate
for
natural
inclination
renders
it
immensely
more
easy
to
attain
that
for
which
such
inclination
is
felt
since
almost
every
one
has
a
much
stronger
preference
for
things
which
closely
concern
himself
it
will
in
general
be
right
for
a
man
to
aim
rather
at
goods
affecting
himself
and
those
in
whom
he
has
a
strong
personal
interest
than
to
attempt
a
more
extended
beneficence
egoism
is
undoubtedly
superior
to
altruism
as
a
doctrine
of
means
in
the
immense
majority
of
cases
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
aim
at
securing
some
good
in
which
we
are
concerned
since
for
that
very
reason
we
are
far
more
likely
to
secure
it
goods
which
can
be
secured
in
a
future
so
near
as
to
be
called
the
present
are
in
general
to
be
preferred
to
those
which
being
in
a
further
future
are
for
that
reason
far
less
certain
of
attainment
if
we
regard
all
that
we
do
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
rightness
that
is
to
say
as
a
mere
means
to
good
we
are
apt
to
neglect
one
fact
at
least
which
is
certain
namely
that
a
thing
that
is
really
good
in
itself
if
it
exist
now
has
precisely
the
same
value
as
a
thing
of
the
same
kind
which
may
be
caused
to
exist
in
the
future
moreover
moral
rules
as
has
been
said
are
in
general
not
directly
means
to
positive
goods
but
to
what
is
necessary
for
the
existence
of
positive
goods
and
so
much
of
our
labour
must
in
any
case
be
devoted
to
securing
the
continuance
of
what
is
thus
a
mere
means
the
claims
of
industry
and
attention
to
health
determine
the
employment
of
so
large
a
part
of
our
time
that
in
cases
where
choice
is
open
the
certain
attainment
of
a
present
good
will
in
general
have
the
strongest
claims
upon
us
if
it
were
not
so
the
whole
of
life
would
be
spent
in
merely
assuring
its
continuance
and
so
far
as
the
same
rule
were
continued
in
the
future
that
for
the
sake
of
which
it
is
worth
having
would
never
exist
at
all
a
fourth
conclusion
which
follows
from
the
fact
that
what
is
right
or
what
is
our
duty
must
in
any
case
be
defined
as
what
is
a
means
to
good
is
as
was
pointed
out
above
that
the
common
distinction
between
these
and
the
expedient
or
useful
disappears
our
duty
is
merely
that
which
will
be
a
means
to
the
best
possible
and
the
expedient
if
it
is
really
expedient
must
be
just
the
same
we
can
not
distinguish
them
by
saying
that
the
former
is
something
which
we
ought
to
do
whereas
of
the
latter
we
can
not
say
we
in
short
the
two
concepts
are
not
as
is
commonly
assumed
by
all
except
utilitarian
moralists
simple
concepts
ultimately
distinct
there
is
no
such
distinction
in
ethics
the
only
fundamental
distinction
is
between
what
is
good
in
itself
and
what
is
good
as
a
means
the
latter
of
which
implies
the
former
but
it
has
been
shewn
that
the
distinction
between
duty
and
expediency
does
not
correspond
to
this
both
must
be
defined
as
means
to
good
though
both
be
ends
in
themselves
the
question
remains
then
what
is
the
distinction
between
duty
and
expediency
one
distinction
to
which
these
distinct
words
refer
is
plain
enough
certain
classes
of
action
commonly
excite
the
specifically
moral
sentiments
whereas
other
classes
do
not
and
the
word
duty
is
commonly
applied
only
to
the
class
of
actions
which
excite
moral
approval
or
of
which
the
omission
excites
moral
disapproval
especially
to
the
latter
why
this
moral
sentiment
should
have
become
attached
to
some
kinds
of
actions
and
not
to
others
is
a
question
which
can
certainly
not
yet
be
answered
but
it
may
be
observed
that
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
the
actions
to
which
it
was
attached
were
or
are
in
all
cases
such
as
aided
or
aid
the
survival
of
a
race
it
was
probably
originally
attached
to
many
religious
rites
and
ceremonies
which
had
not
the
smallest
utility
in
this
respect
it
appears
however
that
among
us
the
classes
of
action
to
which
it
is
attached
also
have
two
other
characteristics
in
enough
cases
to
have
influenced
the
meaning
of
the
words
duty
and
one
of
these
is
that
duties
are
in
general
actions
which
a
considerable
number
of
individuals
are
strongly
tempted
to
omit
the
second
is
that
the
omission
of
a
duty
generally
entails
consequences
markedly
disagreeable
to
one
the
first
of
these
is
a
more
universal
characteristic
than
the
second
since
the
disagreeable
effects
on
other
people
of
the
duties
prudence
and
temperance
are
not
so
marked
as
those
on
the
future
of
the
agent
himself
whereas
the
temptations
to
imprudence
and
intemperance
are
very
strong
still
on
the
whole
the
class
of
actions
called
duties
exhibit
both
characteristics
they
are
not
only
actions
against
the
performance
of
which
there
are
strong
natural
inclinations
but
also
actions
of
which
the
most
obvious
effects
commonly
considered
goods
are
effects
on
other
people
expedient
actions
on
the
other
hand
are
actions
to
which
strong
natural
inclinations
prompt
us
almost
universally
and
of
which
all
the
most
obvious
effects
commonly
considered
good
are
effects
upon
the
agent
we
may
then
roughly
distinguish
duties
from
expedient
actions
as
actions
with
regard
to
which
there
is
a
moral
sentiment
which
we
are
often
tempted
to
omit
and
of
which
the
most
obvious
effects
are
effects
upon
others
than
the
agent
but
it
is
to
be
noticed
that
none
of
these
characteristics
by
which
a
duty
is
distinguished
from
an
expedient
action
gives
us
any
reason
to
infer
that
the
former
class
of
actions
are
more
useful
than
the
latter
that
they
tend
to
produce
a
greater
balance
of
good
nor
when
we
ask
the
question
is
this
my
duty
do
we
mean
to
ask
whether
the
action
in
question
has
these
characteristics
we
are
asking
simply
whether
it
will
produce
the
best
possible
result
on
the
whole
and
if
we
asked
this
question
with
regard
to
expedient
actions
we
should
quite
as
often
have
to
answer
it
in
the
affirmative
as
when
we
ask
it
with
regard
to
actions
which
have
the
three
characteristics
of
it
is
true
that
when
we
ask
the
question
is
this
expedient
we
are
asking
a
different
question
namely
whether
it
will
have
certain
kinds
of
effect
with
regard
to
which
we
do
not
enquire
whether
they
are
good
or
not
nevertheless
if
it
should
be
doubted
in
any
particular
case
whether
these
effects
were
good
this
doubt
is
understood
as
throwing
doubt
upon
the
action
s
expediency
if
we
are
required
to
an
action
s
expediency
we
can
only
do
so
by
asking
precisely
the
same
question
by
which
we
should
prove
it
a
duty
namely
has
it
the
best
possible
effects
on
the
whole
accordingly
the
question
whether
an
action
is
a
duty
or
merely
expedient
is
one
which
has
no
bearing
on
the
ethical
question
whether
we
ought
to
do
it
in
the
sense
in
which
either
duty
or
expediency
are
taken
as
ultimate
for
doing
an
action
they
are
taken
in
exactly
the
same
sense
if
i
ask
whether
an
action
is
my
duty
or
expedient
the
predicate
of
which
i
question
the
applicability
to
the
action
in
question
is
precisely
the
same
in
both
cases
i
am
asking
is
this
event
the
best
on
the
whole
that
i
can
effect
and
whether
the
event
in
question
be
some
effect
upon
what
is
as
it
usually
is
where
we
talk
of
expediency
or
some
other
event
as
is
usual
where
we
talk
of
duty
this
distinction
has
no
more
relevance
to
my
answer
than
the
distinction
between
two
different
effects
on
me
or
two
different
effects
on
others
the
true
distinction
between
duties
and
expedient
actions
is
not
that
the
former
are
actions
which
it
is
in
any
sense
more
useful
or
obligatory
or
better
to
perform
but
that
they
are
actions
which
it
is
more
useful
to
praise
and
to
enforce
by
sanctions
since
they
are
actions
which
there
is
a
temptation
to
omit
with
regard
to
interested
actions
the
case
is
somewhat
different
when
we
ask
the
question
is
this
really
to
my
interest
we
appear
to
be
asking
exclusively
whether
its
upon
are
the
best
possible
and
it
may
well
happen
that
what
will
effect
me
in
the
manner
which
is
really
the
best
possible
will
not
produce
the
best
possible
results
on
the
whole
accordingly
true
may
be
different
from
the
course
which
is
really
expedient
and
dutiful
to
assert
that
an
action
is
to
my
interest
is
indeed
as
was
pointed
out
in
chap
iii
to
assert
that
its
effects
are
really
good
my
own
good
only
denotes
some
event
affecting
me
which
is
good
absolutely
and
objectively
it
is
the
thing
and
not
its
goodness
which
is
everything
must
be
either
a
part
of
universal
good
or
else
not
good
at
all
there
is
no
third
alternative
conception
good
for
but
my
interest
though
it
must
be
something
truly
good
is
only
one
among
possible
good
effects
and
hence
by
effecting
it
though
we
shall
be
doing
good
we
may
be
doing
less
good
on
the
whole
than
if
we
had
acted
otherwise
may
be
a
real
duty
just
as
the
sacrifice
of
any
single
good
whether
affecting
ourselves
or
others
may
be
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
a
better
total
result
hence
the
fact
that
an
action
is
really
to
my
interest
can
never
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
doing
it
by
shewing
that
it
is
not
a
means
to
the
best
possible
we
do
not
shew
that
it
is
not
to
my
interest
as
we
do
shew
that
it
is
not
expedient
nevertheless
there
is
no
necessary
conflict
between
duty
and
interest
what
is
to
my
interest
may
also
be
a
means
to
the
best
possible
and
the
chief
distinction
conveyed
by
the
distinct
words
duty
and
interest
seems
to
be
not
this
source
of
possible
conflict
but
the
same
which
is
conveyed
by
the
contrast
between
duty
and
by
interested
actions
are
meant
those
which
whether
a
means
to
the
best
possible
or
not
are
such
as
have
their
most
obvious
effects
on
the
agent
which
he
generally
has
no
temptation
to
omit
and
with
regard
to
which
we
feel
no
moral
sentiment
that
is
to
say
the
distinction
is
not
primarily
ethical
here
too
duties
are
not
in
general
more
useful
or
obligatory
than
interested
actions
they
are
only
actions
which
it
is
more
useful
to
praise
a
fifth
conclusion
of
some
importance
in
relation
to
practical
ethics
concerns
the
manner
in
which
virtues
are
to
be
judged
what
is
meant
by
calling
a
thing
a
virtue
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
aristotle
s
definition
is
right
in
the
main
so
far
as
he
says
that
it
is
an
habitual
disposition
to
perform
certain
actions
this
is
one
of
the
marks
by
which
we
should
distinguish
a
virtue
from
other
things
but
virtue
and
vice
are
also
ethical
terms
that
is
to
say
when
we
use
them
seriously
we
mean
to
convey
praise
by
the
one
and
dispraise
by
the
other
and
to
praise
a
thing
is
to
assert
either
that
it
is
good
in
itself
or
else
that
it
is
a
means
to
good
are
we
then
to
include
in
our
definition
of
virtue
that
it
must
be
a
thing
good
in
itself
now
it
is
certain
that
virtues
are
commonly
regarded
as
good
in
themselves
the
feeling
of
moral
approbation
with
which
we
generally
regard
them
partly
consists
in
an
attribution
to
them
of
intrinsic
value
even
a
hedonist
when
he
feels
a
moral
sentiment
towards
them
is
regarding
them
as
and
virtue
has
been
the
chief
competitor
with
pleasure
for
the
position
of
good
nevertheless
i
do
not
think
we
can
regard
it
as
part
of
the
definition
of
virtue
that
it
should
be
good
in
itself
for
the
name
has
so
far
an
independent
meaning
that
if
in
any
particular
case
a
disposition
commonly
considered
virtuous
were
proved
not
to
be
good
in
itself
we
should
not
think
that
a
sufficient
reason
for
saying
that
it
not
a
virtue
but
was
only
to
be
so
the
test
for
the
ethical
connotation
of
virtue
is
the
same
as
that
for
duty
what
should
we
require
to
be
proved
about
a
particular
instance
in
order
to
say
that
the
name
was
wrongly
applied
to
it
and
the
test
which
is
thus
applied
both
to
virtues
and
duties
and
considered
to
be
final
is
the
question
is
it
a
means
to
good
if
it
could
be
shewn
of
any
particular
disposition
commonly
considered
virtuous
that
it
was
generally
harmful
we
should
at
once
say
then
it
is
not
really
virtuous
accordingly
a
virtue
may
be
defined
as
an
habitual
disposition
to
perform
certain
actions
which
generally
produce
the
best
possible
results
nor
is
there
any
doubt
as
to
the
kind
of
actions
which
it
is
virtuous
habitually
to
perform
they
are
in
general
those
which
are
duties
with
this
modification
that
we
also
include
those
which
be
duties
if
only
it
were
possible
for
people
in
general
to
perform
them
accordingly
with
regard
to
virtues
the
same
conclusion
holds
as
with
regard
to
duties
if
they
are
really
virtues
they
must
be
generally
good
as
means
nor
do
i
wish
to
dispute
that
most
virtues
commonly
considered
as
such
as
well
as
most
duties
really
are
means
to
good
but
it
does
not
follow
that
they
are
a
bit
more
useful
than
those
dispositions
and
inclinations
which
lead
us
to
perform
interested
actions
as
duties
from
expedient
actions
so
virtues
are
distinguished
from
other
useful
dispositions
not
by
any
superior
utility
but
by
the
fact
that
they
are
dispositions
which
it
is
particularly
useful
to
praise
and
to
sanction
because
there
are
strong
and
common
temptations
to
neglect
the
actions
to
which
they
lead
virtues
therefore
are
habitual
dispositions
to
perform
actions
which
are
duties
or
which
would
be
duties
if
a
volition
were
sufficient
on
the
part
of
most
men
to
ensure
their
performance
and
duties
are
a
particular
class
of
those
actions
of
which
the
performance
has
at
least
generally
better
total
results
than
the
omission
they
are
that
is
to
say
actions
generally
good
as
means
but
not
all
such
actions
are
duties
the
name
is
confined
to
that
particular
class
which
it
is
often
difficult
to
perform
because
there
are
strong
temptations
to
the
contrary
it
follows
that
in
order
to
decide
whether
any
particular
disposition
or
action
is
a
virtue
or
a
duty
we
must
face
all
the
difficulties
enumerated
in
section
of
this
chapter
we
shall
not
be
entitled
to
assert
that
any
disposition
or
action
is
a
virtue
or
duty
except
as
a
result
of
an
investigation
such
as
was
there
described
we
must
be
able
to
prove
that
the
disposition
or
action
in
question
is
generally
better
as
a
means
than
any
alternatives
possible
and
likely
to
occur
and
this
we
shall
only
be
able
to
prove
for
particular
states
of
society
what
is
a
virtue
or
a
duty
in
one
state
of
society
may
not
be
so
in
another
but
there
is
another
question
with
regard
to
virtues
and
duties
which
must
be
settled
by
intuition
alone
by
the
properly
guarded
method
which
was
explained
in
discussing
hedonism
this
is
the
question
whether
the
dispositions
and
actions
commonly
regarded
rightly
or
not
as
virtues
or
duties
are
good
in
themselves
whether
they
have
intrinsic
value
virtue
or
the
exercise
of
virtue
has
very
commonly
been
asserted
by
moralists
to
be
either
the
sole
good
or
at
least
the
best
of
goods
indeed
so
far
as
moralists
have
discussed
the
question
what
is
good
in
itself
at
all
they
have
generally
assumed
that
it
must
be
either
virtue
or
pleasure
it
would
hardly
have
been
possible
that
such
a
gross
difference
of
opinion
should
exist
or
that
it
should
have
been
assumed
the
discussion
be
limited
to
two
such
alternatives
if
the
meaning
of
the
question
had
been
clearly
apprehended
and
we
have
already
seen
that
the
meaning
of
the
question
has
hardly
ever
been
clearly
apprehended
almost
all
ethical
writers
have
committed
the
naturalistic
fallacy
they
have
failed
to
perceive
that
the
notion
of
intrinsic
value
is
simple
and
unique
and
almost
all
have
failed
in
consequence
to
distinguish
clearly
between
means
and
end
they
have
discussed
as
if
it
were
simple
and
unambiguous
the
question
what
ought
we
to
do
or
what
ought
to
exist
now
without
distinguishing
whether
the
reason
why
a
thing
ought
to
be
done
or
to
exist
now
is
that
it
is
itself
possessed
of
intrinsic
value
or
that
it
is
a
means
to
what
has
intrinsic
value
we
shall
therefore
be
prepared
to
find
that
virtue
has
as
little
claim
to
be
considered
the
sole
or
chief
good
as
pleasure
more
especially
after
seeing
that
so
far
as
definition
goes
to
call
a
thing
a
virtue
is
merely
to
declare
that
it
is
a
means
to
good
the
advocates
of
virtue
have
we
shall
see
this
superiority
over
the
hedonists
that
inasmuch
as
virtues
are
very
complex
mental
facts
there
are
included
in
them
many
things
which
are
good
in
themselves
and
good
in
a
much
higher
degree
than
pleasure
the
advocates
of
hedonism
on
the
other
hand
have
the
superiority
that
their
method
emphasizes
the
distinction
between
means
and
ends
although
they
have
not
apprehended
the
distinction
clearly
enough
to
perceive
that
the
special
ethical
predicate
which
they
assign
to
pleasure
as
being
a
mere
means
must
also
apply
to
many
other
things
with
regard
then
to
the
intrinsic
value
of
virtue
it
may
be
stated
broadly
that
the
majority
of
dispositions
which
we
call
by
that
name
and
which
really
do
conform
to
the
definition
so
far
as
that
they
are
dispositions
generally
valuable
as
means
at
least
in
our
society
have
no
intrinsic
value
whatever
and
that
no
one
element
which
is
contained
in
the
minority
nor
even
all
the
different
elements
put
together
can
without
gross
absurdity
be
regarded
as
the
sole
good
as
to
the
second
point
it
may
be
observed
that
even
those
who
hold
the
view
that
the
sole
good
is
to
be
found
in
virtue
almost
invariably
hold
other
views
contradictory
of
this
owing
chiefly
to
a
failure
to
analyse
the
meaning
of
ethical
concepts
the
most
marked
instance
of
this
inconsistency
is
to
be
found
in
the
common
christian
conception
that
virtue
though
the
sole
good
can
yet
be
rewarded
by
something
other
than
virtue
heaven
is
commonly
considered
as
the
reward
of
virtue
and
yet
it
is
also
commonly
considered
that
in
order
to
be
such
a
reward
it
must
contain
some
element
called
happiness
which
is
certainly
not
completely
identical
with
the
mere
exercise
of
those
virtues
which
it
rewards
but
if
so
then
something
which
is
not
virtue
must
be
either
good
in
itself
or
an
element
in
what
has
most
intrinsic
value
it
is
not
commonly
observed
that
if
a
thing
is
really
to
be
a
reward
it
must
be
something
good
in
itself
it
is
absurd
to
talk
of
rewarding
a
person
by
giving
him
something
which
is
less
valuable
than
what
he
already
has
or
which
has
no
value
at
all
thus
kant
s
view
that
virtue
renders
us
of
happiness
is
in
flagrant
contradiction
with
the
view
which
he
implies
and
which
is
associated
with
his
name
that
a
good
will
is
the
only
thing
having
intrinsic
value
it
does
not
indeed
entitle
us
to
make
the
charge
sometimes
made
that
kant
is
inconsistently
an
eudaemonist
or
hedonist
for
it
does
not
imply
that
happiness
is
the
sole
good
but
it
does
imply
that
the
good
will
is
the
sole
good
that
a
state
of
things
in
which
we
are
both
virtuous
and
happy
is
better
in
itself
than
one
in
which
the
happiness
is
absent
in
order
however
justly
to
consider
the
claims
of
virtue
to
intrinsic
value
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
several
very
different
mental
states
all
of
which
fall
under
the
general
definition
that
they
are
habitual
dispositions
to
perform
duties
we
may
thus
distinguish
three
very
different
states
all
of
which
are
liable
to
be
confused
with
one
another
upon
each
of
which
different
moral
systems
have
laid
great
stress
and
for
each
of
which
the
claim
has
been
made
that
it
alone
constitutes
virtue
and
by
implication
that
it
is
the
sole
good
we
may
first
of
all
distinguish
between
that
permanent
characteristic
of
mind
which
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
performance
of
duty
has
become
in
the
strict
sense
a
habit
like
many
of
the
operations
performed
in
the
putting
on
of
clothes
and
that
permanent
characteristic
which
consists
in
the
fact
that
what
may
be
called
good
motives
habitually
help
to
cause
the
performance
of
duties
and
in
the
second
division
we
may
distinguish
between
the
habitual
tendency
to
be
actuated
by
one
motive
namely
the
desire
to
do
duty
for
duty
s
sake
and
all
other
motives
such
as
love
benevolence
etc
we
thus
get
the
three
kinds
of
virtue
of
which
we
are
now
to
consider
the
intrinsic
value
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
man
s
character
may
be
such
that
he
habitually
performs
certain
duties
without
the
thought
ever
occurring
to
him
when
he
wills
them
either
that
they
are
duties
or
that
any
good
will
result
from
them
of
such
a
man
we
can
not
and
do
not
refuse
to
say
that
he
possesses
the
virtue
consisting
in
the
disposition
to
perform
those
duties
i
for
instance
am
honest
in
the
sense
that
i
habitually
abstain
from
any
of
the
actions
legally
qualified
as
thieving
even
where
some
other
persons
would
be
strongly
tempted
to
commit
them
it
would
be
grossly
contrary
to
common
usage
to
deny
that
for
this
reason
i
really
have
the
virtue
of
honesty
it
is
quite
certain
that
i
have
an
habitual
disposition
to
perform
a
duty
and
that
as
many
people
as
possible
should
have
a
like
disposition
is
no
doubt
of
great
utility
it
is
good
as
a
means
yet
i
may
safely
assert
that
neither
my
various
performances
of
this
duty
nor
my
disposition
to
perform
them
have
the
smallest
intrinsic
value
it
is
because
the
majority
of
instances
of
virtue
seem
to
be
of
this
nature
that
we
may
venture
to
assert
that
virtues
have
in
general
no
intrinsic
value
whatsoever
and
there
seems
good
reason
to
think
that
the
more
generally
they
are
of
this
nature
the
more
useful
they
are
since
a
great
economy
of
labour
is
effected
when
a
useful
action
becomes
habitual
or
instinctive
but
to
maintain
that
a
virtue
which
includes
no
more
than
this
is
good
in
itself
is
a
gross
absurdity
and
of
this
gross
absurdity
it
may
be
observed
the
ethics
of
aristotle
is
guilty
for
his
definition
of
virtue
does
not
exclude
a
disposition
to
perform
actions
in
this
way
whereas
his
descriptions
of
the
particular
virtues
plainly
such
actions
that
an
action
in
order
to
exhibit
virtue
must
be
done
τοῦ
καλοῦ
ἕνεκα
is
a
qualification
which
he
allows
often
to
drop
out
of
sight
and
on
the
other
hand
he
seems
certainly
to
regard
the
exercise
of
virtues
as
an
end
in
itself
his
treatment
of
ethics
is
indeed
in
the
most
important
points
highly
unsystematic
and
confused
owing
to
his
attempt
to
base
it
on
the
naturalistic
fallacy
for
strictly
we
should
be
obliged
by
his
words
to
regard
θεωρία
as
the
thing
good
in
itself
in
which
case
the
goodness
which
he
attributes
to
the
practical
virtues
can
not
be
intrinsic
value
while
on
the
other
hand
he
does
not
seem
to
regard
it
merely
as
utility
since
he
makes
no
attempt
to
shew
that
they
are
means
to
θεωρία
but
there
seems
no
doubt
that
on
the
whole
he
regards
the
exercise
of
the
practical
virtues
as
a
good
of
the
same
kind
as
having
intrinsic
value
only
in
a
less
degree
than
θεωρία
so
that
he
can
not
avoid
the
charge
that
he
recommends
as
having
intrinsic
value
such
instances
of
the
exercise
of
virtue
as
we
are
at
present
discussing
instances
of
a
disposition
to
perform
actions
which
in
the
modern
phrase
have
merely
an
external
that
he
is
right
in
applying
the
word
virtue
to
such
a
disposition
can
not
be
doubted
but
the
protest
against
the
view
that
external
rightness
is
sufficient
to
constitute
either
duty
or
virtue
a
protest
which
is
commonly
and
with
some
justice
attributed
as
a
merit
to
christian
morals
seems
in
the
main
to
be
a
mistaken
way
of
pointing
out
an
important
truth
namely
that
where
there
is
only
external
rightness
there
is
certainly
no
intrinsic
value
it
is
commonly
assumed
though
wrongly
that
to
call
a
thing
a
virtue
means
that
it
has
intrinsic
value
and
on
this
assumption
the
view
that
virtue
does
not
consist
in
a
mere
disposition
to
do
externally
right
actions
does
really
constitute
an
advance
in
ethical
truth
beyond
the
ethics
of
aristotle
the
inference
that
if
virtue
includes
in
its
meaning
good
in
itself
then
aristotle
s
definition
of
virtue
is
not
adequate
and
expresses
a
false
ethical
judgment
is
perfectly
correct
only
the
premiss
that
virtue
does
include
this
in
its
meaning
is
mistaken
a
man
s
character
may
be
such
that
when
he
habitually
performs
a
particular
duty
there
is
in
each
case
of
his
performance
present
in
his
mind
a
love
of
some
intrinsically
good
consequence
which
he
expects
to
produce
by
his
action
or
a
hatred
of
some
intrinsically
evil
consequence
which
he
hopes
to
prevent
by
it
in
such
a
case
this
love
or
hatred
will
generally
be
part
cause
of
his
action
and
we
may
then
call
it
one
of
his
where
such
a
feeling
as
this
is
present
habitually
in
the
performance
of
duties
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
state
of
the
man
s
mind
in
performing
it
contains
something
intrinsically
good
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
where
a
disposition
to
perform
duties
consists
in
the
disposition
to
be
moved
to
them
by
such
feelings
we
call
that
disposition
a
virtue
here
therefore
we
have
instances
of
virtue
the
exercise
of
which
really
contains
something
that
is
good
in
itself
and
in
general
we
may
say
that
wherever
a
virtue
does
consist
in
a
disposition
to
have
certain
motives
the
exercise
of
that
virtue
be
intrinsically
good
although
the
degree
of
its
goodness
may
vary
indefinitely
according
to
the
precise
nature
of
the
motives
and
their
objects
in
so
far
then
as
christianity
tends
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
motives
of
the
inward
disposition
with
which
a
right
action
is
done
we
may
say
that
it
has
done
a
service
to
ethics
but
it
should
be
noticed
that
when
christian
ethics
as
represented
by
the
new
testament
are
praised
for
this
two
distinctions
of
the
utmost
importance
which
they
entirely
neglect
are
very
commonly
overlooked
in
the
first
place
the
new
testament
is
largely
occupied
with
continuing
the
tradition
of
the
hebrew
prophets
by
recommending
such
virtues
as
justice
and
mercy
as
against
mere
ritual
observances
and
in
so
far
as
it
does
this
it
is
recommending
virtues
which
may
be
good
as
means
exactly
like
the
aristotelian
virtues
this
characteristic
of
its
teaching
must
therefore
be
rigorously
distinguished
from
that
which
consists
in
its
enforcement
of
such
a
view
as
that
to
be
angry
without
a
cause
is
as
bad
as
actually
to
commit
murder
and
in
the
second
place
though
the
new
testament
does
praise
some
things
which
are
only
good
as
means
and
others
which
are
good
in
themselves
it
entirely
fails
to
recognise
this
distinction
though
the
state
of
the
man
who
is
angry
may
be
really
as
bad
in
itself
as
that
of
the
murderer
and
so
far
christ
may
be
right
his
language
would
lead
us
to
suppose
that
it
is
as
bad
in
every
way
that
it
as
much
evil
and
this
is
utterly
false
in
short
when
christian
ethics
approves
it
does
not
distinguish
whether
its
approval
asserts
this
is
a
means
to
good
or
this
is
good
in
itself
and
hence
it
both
praises
things
merely
good
as
means
as
if
they
were
good
in
themselves
and
things
merely
good
in
themselves
as
if
they
were
also
good
as
means
moreover
it
should
be
noticed
that
if
christian
ethics
does
draw
attention
to
those
elements
in
virtues
which
are
good
in
themselves
it
is
by
no
means
alone
in
this
the
ethics
of
plato
are
distinguished
by
upholding
far
more
clearly
and
consistently
than
any
other
system
the
view
that
intrinsic
value
belongs
exclusively
to
those
states
of
mind
which
consist
in
love
of
what
is
good
or
hatred
of
what
is
evil
but
the
ethics
of
christianity
are
distinguished
from
those
of
plato
by
emphasizing
the
value
of
one
particular
motive
that
which
consists
in
the
emotion
excited
by
the
idea
not
of
any
intrinsically
good
consequences
of
the
action
in
question
nor
even
of
the
action
itself
but
by
that
of
its
rightness
this
idea
of
abstract
rightness
and
the
various
degrees
of
the
specific
emotion
excited
by
it
are
what
constitute
the
specifically
moral
sentiment
or
an
action
seems
to
be
most
properly
termed
internally
right
solely
in
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
agent
has
previously
regarded
it
as
right
the
idea
of
rightness
must
have
been
present
to
his
mind
but
need
not
necessarily
have
been
among
his
motives
and
we
mean
by
a
conscientious
man
one
who
when
he
deliberates
always
has
this
idea
in
his
mind
and
does
not
act
until
he
believes
that
his
action
is
right
this
sense
of
the
term
must
be
carefully
distinguished
from
that
in
which
the
agent
s
intention
may
be
said
to
be
right
if
only
the
results
he
intended
would
have
been
the
best
possible
the
presence
of
this
idea
and
its
action
as
a
motive
certainly
seem
to
have
become
more
common
objects
of
notice
and
commendation
owing
to
the
influence
of
christianity
but
it
is
important
to
observe
that
there
is
no
ground
for
the
view
which
kant
implies
that
it
is
the
motive
which
the
new
testament
regards
as
intrinsically
valuable
there
seems
little
doubt
that
when
christ
tells
us
to
love
our
neighbours
as
ourselves
he
did
not
mean
merely
what
kant
calls
practical
love
beneficence
of
which
the
motive
is
the
idea
of
its
rightness
or
the
emotion
caused
by
that
idea
among
the
inward
dispositions
of
which
the
new
testament
inculcates
the
value
there
are
certainly
included
what
kant
terms
mere
natural
inclinations
such
as
pity
etc
but
what
are
we
to
say
of
virtue
when
it
consists
in
a
disposition
to
be
moved
to
the
performance
of
duties
by
this
idea
it
seems
difficult
to
deny
that
the
emotion
excited
by
rightness
as
such
has
some
intrinsic
value
and
still
more
difficult
to
deny
that
its
presence
may
heighten
the
value
of
some
wholes
into
which
it
enters
but
on
the
other
hand
it
certainly
has
not
more
value
than
many
of
the
motives
treated
in
our
last
section
emotions
of
love
towards
things
really
good
in
themselves
and
as
for
kant
s
implication
that
it
is
the
sole
good
this
is
inconsistent
with
other
of
his
own
views
for
he
certainly
regards
it
as
to
perform
the
actions
to
which
he
maintains
that
it
prompts
us
namely
material
duties
than
to
omit
them
but
if
better
at
all
then
these
actions
must
be
better
either
in
themselves
or
as
a
means
the
former
hypothesis
would
directly
contradict
the
statement
that
this
motive
was
good
and
the
latter
is
excluded
by
kant
himself
since
he
maintains
that
no
actions
can
the
existence
of
this
motive
and
it
may
also
be
observed
that
the
other
claim
which
he
makes
for
it
namely
that
it
is
good
as
a
means
can
also
not
be
maintained
it
is
as
certain
as
anything
can
be
that
very
harmful
actions
may
be
done
from
conscientious
motives
and
that
conscience
does
not
always
tell
us
the
truth
about
what
actions
are
right
nor
can
it
be
maintained
even
that
it
is
useful
than
many
other
motives
all
that
can
be
admitted
is
that
it
is
one
of
the
things
which
are
generally
useful
kant
so
far
as
i
know
never
expressly
states
this
view
but
it
is
implied
in
his
argument
against
heteronomy
what
more
i
have
to
say
with
regard
to
those
elements
in
some
virtues
which
are
good
in
themselves
and
with
regard
to
their
relative
degrees
of
excellence
as
well
as
the
proof
that
all
of
them
together
can
not
be
the
sole
good
may
be
deferred
to
the
next
chapter
the
main
points
in
this
chapter
to
which
i
desire
to
direct
attention
may
be
summarised
as
follows
i
first
pointed
out
how
the
with
which
it
deals
namely
ethical
judgments
on
conduct
involves
a
question
utterly
different
in
kind
from
the
two
previously
discussed
namely
what
is
the
nature
of
the
predicate
peculiar
to
ethics
and
what
kinds
of
things
themselves
possess
this
predicate
practical
ethics
asks
not
what
ought
to
be
but
what
ought
we
to
do
it
asks
what
actions
are
what
actions
are
and
what
and
all
these
questions
can
only
be
answered
by
shewing
the
relation
of
the
actions
in
question
as
or
to
what
is
good
in
itself
the
enquiries
of
practical
ethics
thus
fall
entirely
under
the
division
of
ethical
questions
questions
which
ask
what
is
good
as
a
means
which
is
equivalent
to
what
is
a
means
to
good
what
is
cause
or
necessary
condition
of
things
good
in
themselves
but
it
asks
this
question
almost
exclusively
with
regard
to
actions
which
it
is
possible
for
most
men
to
perform
if
only
they
them
and
with
regard
to
these
it
does
not
ask
merely
which
among
them
will
have
good
or
bad
result
but
which
among
all
the
actions
possible
to
volition
at
any
moment
will
produce
the
best
result
to
assert
that
an
action
is
a
duty
is
to
assert
that
it
is
such
a
possible
action
which
will
in
certain
known
circumstances
produce
better
results
than
any
other
it
follows
that
universal
propositions
of
which
duty
is
predicate
so
far
from
being
always
require
a
proof
which
it
is
beyond
our
present
means
of
knowledge
ever
to
give
but
all
that
ethics
has
attempted
or
can
attempt
is
to
shew
that
certain
actions
possible
by
volition
produce
better
or
worse
total
results
than
any
probable
alternative
and
it
must
obviously
be
very
difficult
to
shew
this
with
regard
to
the
total
results
even
in
a
comparatively
near
future
whereas
that
what
has
the
best
results
in
such
a
near
future
also
has
the
best
on
the
whole
is
a
point
requiring
an
investigation
which
it
has
not
received
if
it
is
true
and
if
accordingly
we
give
the
name
of
duty
to
actions
which
produce
better
total
results
in
the
near
future
than
any
possible
alternative
it
may
be
possible
to
prove
that
a
few
of
the
commonest
rules
of
duty
are
true
but
in
certain
conditions
of
society
which
may
be
more
or
less
universally
presented
in
history
and
such
a
proof
is
only
possible
some
without
a
correct
judgment
of
what
things
are
good
or
bad
in
themselves
a
judgment
which
has
never
yet
been
offered
by
ethical
writers
with
regard
to
actions
of
which
the
utility
is
thus
proved
the
individual
should
perform
them
but
in
other
cases
where
rules
are
commonly
offered
he
should
rather
judge
of
the
probable
results
in
his
particular
case
guided
by
a
correct
conception
of
what
things
are
intrinsically
good
or
bad
in
order
that
any
action
may
be
shewn
to
be
a
duty
it
must
be
shewn
to
fulfil
the
above
conditions
but
the
actions
commonly
called
duties
do
not
fulfil
them
to
any
greater
extent
than
expedient
or
interested
actions
by
calling
them
duties
we
only
mean
that
they
have
certain
predicates
similarly
by
virtue
is
mainly
meant
a
permanent
disposition
to
perform
duties
in
this
restricted
sense
and
accordingly
a
virtue
if
it
is
really
a
virtue
must
be
good
a
in
the
sense
that
it
fulfils
the
above
conditions
but
it
is
not
as
a
means
than
dispositions
it
generally
has
no
value
in
itself
and
where
it
has
it
is
far
from
being
the
sole
good
or
the
best
of
goods
accordingly
virtue
is
not
as
is
commonly
implied
an
unique
predicate
chapter
vi
the
ideal
the
title
of
this
chapter
is
ambiguous
when
we
call
a
state
of
things
ideal
we
may
mean
three
distinct
things
which
have
only
this
in
common
that
we
always
do
mean
to
assert
of
the
state
of
things
in
question
not
only
that
it
is
good
in
itself
but
that
it
is
good
in
itself
in
a
much
higher
degree
than
many
other
things
the
first
of
these
meanings
of
ideal
is
that
to
which
the
phrase
ideal
is
most
properly
confined
by
this
is
meant
the
state
of
things
the
summum
bonum
or
absolute
good
it
is
in
this
sense
that
a
right
conception
of
heaven
would
be
a
right
conception
of
the
ideal
we
mean
by
the
ideal
a
state
of
things
which
would
be
absolutely
perfect
but
this
conception
may
be
quite
clearly
distinguished
from
a
second
namely
that
of
the
best
state
of
things
in
this
world
this
second
conception
may
be
identified
with
that
which
has
frequently
figured
in
philosophy
as
the
human
good
or
the
end
towards
which
our
action
should
be
directed
it
is
in
this
sense
that
utopias
are
said
to
be
ideals
the
constructor
of
an
utopia
may
suppose
many
things
to
be
possible
which
are
in
fact
impossible
but
he
always
assumes
that
some
things
at
least
are
rendered
impossible
by
natural
laws
and
hence
his
construction
differs
essentially
from
one
which
may
disregard
natural
laws
however
certainly
established
at
all
events
the
question
what
is
the
best
state
of
things
which
we
could
bring
about
is
quite
distinct
from
the
question
what
would
be
the
best
state
of
things
conceivable
but
thirdly
we
may
mean
by
calling
a
state
of
things
ideal
merely
that
it
is
good
in
itself
in
a
high
degree
and
it
is
obvious
that
the
question
what
things
are
ideal
in
this
sense
is
one
which
must
be
answered
before
we
can
pretend
to
settle
what
is
the
absolute
or
the
human
good
it
is
with
the
ideal
in
this
third
sense
that
this
chapter
will
be
principally
concerned
its
main
object
is
to
arrive
at
some
positive
answer
to
the
fundamental
question
of
ethics
the
question
what
things
are
goods
or
ends
in
themselves
to
this
question
we
have
hitherto
obtained
only
a
negative
answer
the
answer
that
pleasure
is
certainly
not
the
good
i
have
just
said
that
it
is
upon
a
correct
answer
to
this
question
that
correct
answers
to
the
two
other
questions
what
is
the
absolute
good
and
what
is
the
human
good
must
depend
and
before
proceeding
to
discuss
it
it
may
be
well
to
point
out
the
relation
which
it
has
to
these
two
questions
it
is
just
possible
that
the
absolute
good
may
be
entirely
composed
of
qualities
which
we
can
not
even
imagine
this
is
possible
because
though
we
certainly
do
know
a
great
many
things
that
are
and
good
in
a
high
degree
yet
what
is
best
does
not
necessarily
contain
all
the
good
things
there
are
that
this
is
so
follows
from
the
principle
explained
in
chap
i
to
which
it
was
there
proposed
that
the
name
principle
of
organic
unities
should
be
confined
this
principle
is
that
the
intrinsic
value
of
a
whole
is
neither
identical
with
nor
proportional
to
the
sum
of
the
values
of
its
parts
it
follows
from
this
that
though
in
order
to
obtain
the
greatest
possible
sum
of
values
in
its
parts
the
ideal
would
necessarily
contain
all
the
things
which
have
intrinsic
value
in
any
degree
yet
the
whole
which
contained
all
these
parts
might
not
be
so
valuable
as
some
other
whole
from
which
certain
positive
goods
were
omitted
but
if
a
whole
which
does
not
contain
all
positive
goods
may
yet
be
better
than
a
whole
which
does
it
follows
that
the
best
whole
be
one
which
contains
of
the
positive
goods
with
which
we
are
acquainted
it
is
therefore
that
we
can
not
discover
what
the
ideal
is
but
it
is
plain
that
though
this
possibility
can
not
be
denied
no
one
can
have
any
right
to
assert
that
it
is
realised
that
the
ideal
something
unimaginable
we
can
not
judge
of
the
comparative
values
of
things
unless
the
things
we
judge
are
before
our
minds
we
can
not
therefore
be
entitled
to
assert
that
anything
which
we
can
not
imagine
would
be
better
than
some
of
the
things
which
we
can
although
we
are
also
not
entitled
to
deny
the
possibility
that
this
may
be
the
case
consequently
our
search
for
the
ideal
must
be
limited
to
a
search
for
that
one
among
all
the
wholes
composed
of
elements
known
to
us
which
seems
to
be
better
than
all
the
rest
we
shall
never
be
entitled
to
assert
that
this
whole
is
perfection
but
we
shall
be
entitled
to
assert
that
it
is
than
any
other
which
may
be
presented
as
a
rival
but
since
anything
which
we
can
have
any
to
think
ideal
must
be
composed
of
things
that
are
known
to
us
it
is
plain
that
a
comparative
valuation
of
these
must
be
our
chief
instrument
for
deciding
what
is
ideal
the
best
ideal
we
can
construct
will
be
that
state
of
things
which
contains
the
greatest
number
of
things
having
positive
value
and
which
contains
nothing
evil
or
indifferent
that
the
presence
of
none
of
these
goods
or
the
absence
of
things
evil
or
indifferent
seems
to
diminish
the
value
of
the
whole
and
in
fact
the
chief
defect
of
such
attempts
as
have
been
made
by
philosophers
to
construct
an
ideal
to
describe
the
kingdom
of
heaven
seems
to
consist
in
the
fact
that
they
omit
many
things
of
very
great
positive
value
although
it
is
plain
that
this
omission
does
enhance
the
value
of
the
whole
where
this
is
the
case
it
may
be
confidently
asserted
that
the
ideal
proposed
is
not
ideal
and
the
review
of
positive
goods
which
i
am
about
to
undertake
will
i
hope
shew
that
no
ideals
yet
proposed
are
satisfactory
great
positive
goods
it
will
appear
are
so
numerous
that
any
whole
which
shall
contain
them
all
must
be
of
vast
complexity
and
though
this
fact
renders
it
difficult
or
humanly
speaking
impossible
to
decide
what
is
the
ideal
what
is
the
absolutely
best
state
of
things
imaginable
it
is
sufficient
to
condemn
those
ideals
which
are
formed
by
omission
without
any
visible
gain
in
consequence
of
such
omission
philosophers
seem
usually
to
have
sought
only
for
the
of
single
things
neglecting
the
fact
that
a
whole
composed
of
two
great
goods
even
though
one
of
these
be
obviously
inferior
to
the
other
may
yet
be
often
seen
to
be
decidedly
superior
to
either
by
itself
on
the
other
hand
utopias
attempted
descriptions
of
a
heaven
upon
earth
commonly
suffer
not
only
from
this
but
also
from
the
opposite
defect
they
are
commonly
constructed
on
the
principle
of
merely
omitting
the
great
positive
evils
which
exist
at
present
with
utterly
inadequate
regard
to
the
goodness
of
what
they
retain
the
goods
to
which
they
have
regard
are
for
the
most
part
things
which
are
at
best
mere
means
to
good
things
such
as
freedom
which
possibly
nothing
very
good
can
exist
in
this
world
but
which
are
of
no
value
in
themselves
and
are
by
no
means
certain
even
to
produce
anything
of
value
it
is
of
course
necessary
to
the
purpose
of
their
authors
whose
object
is
merely
to
construct
the
best
that
may
be
possible
in
this
world
that
they
should
include
in
the
state
of
things
which
they
describe
many
things
which
are
themselves
indifferent
but
which
according
to
natural
laws
seem
to
be
absolutely
necessary
for
the
existence
of
anything
which
is
good
but
in
fact
they
are
apt
to
include
many
things
of
which
the
necessity
is
by
no
means
apparent
under
the
mistaken
idea
that
these
things
are
and
not
merely
here
and
now
a
means
to
good
while
on
the
other
hand
they
also
omit
from
their
description
great
positive
goods
of
which
the
attainment
seems
to
be
quite
as
possible
as
many
of
the
changes
which
they
recommend
that
is
to
say
conceptions
of
the
human
good
commonly
err
not
only
like
those
of
the
absolute
good
in
omitting
some
great
goods
but
also
by
including
things
indifferent
and
they
both
omit
and
include
in
cases
where
the
limitations
of
natural
necessity
by
the
consideration
of
which
they
are
legitimately
differentiated
from
conceptions
of
the
absolute
good
will
not
justify
the
omission
and
inclusion
it
is
in
fact
obvious
that
in
order
to
decide
correctly
at
what
state
of
things
we
ought
to
aim
we
must
not
only
consider
what
results
it
is
possible
for
us
to
obtain
but
also
which
among
equally
possible
results
will
have
the
greatest
value
and
upon
this
second
enquiry
the
comparative
valuation
of
known
goods
has
a
no
less
important
bearing
than
upon
the
investigation
of
the
absolute
good
the
method
which
must
be
employed
in
order
to
decide
the
question
what
things
have
intrinsic
value
and
in
what
degrees
has
already
been
explained
in
chap
iii
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
correct
decision
on
the
first
part
of
this
question
it
is
necessary
to
consider
what
things
are
such
that
if
they
existed
in
absolute
isolation
we
should
yet
judge
their
existence
to
be
good
and
in
order
to
decide
upon
the
relative
of
value
of
different
things
we
must
similarly
consider
what
comparative
value
seems
to
attach
to
the
isolated
existence
of
each
by
employing
this
method
we
shall
guard
against
two
errors
which
seem
to
have
been
the
chief
causes
which
have
vitiated
previous
conclusions
on
the
subject
the
first
of
these
is
that
which
consists
in
supposing
that
what
seems
absolutely
necessary
here
and
now
for
the
existence
of
anything
good
what
we
can
not
do
without
is
therefore
good
in
itself
if
we
isolate
such
things
which
are
mere
means
to
good
and
suppose
a
world
in
which
they
alone
and
nothing
but
they
existed
their
intrinsic
worthlessness
becomes
apparent
and
secondly
there
is
the
more
subtle
error
which
consists
in
neglecting
the
principle
of
organic
unities
this
error
is
committed
when
it
is
supposed
that
if
one
part
of
a
whole
has
no
intrinsic
value
the
value
of
the
whole
must
reside
entirely
in
the
other
parts
it
has
in
this
way
been
commonly
supposed
that
if
all
valuable
wholes
could
be
seen
to
have
one
and
only
one
common
property
the
wholes
must
be
valuable
solely
they
possess
this
property
and
the
illusion
is
greatly
strengthened
if
the
common
property
in
question
seems
considered
by
itself
to
have
more
value
than
the
other
parts
of
such
wholes
considered
by
themselves
but
if
we
consider
the
property
in
question
and
then
compare
it
with
the
whole
of
which
it
forms
a
part
it
may
become
easily
apparent
that
existing
by
itself
the
property
in
question
has
not
nearly
so
much
value
as
has
the
whole
to
which
it
belongs
thus
if
we
compare
the
value
of
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
absolutely
by
with
the
value
of
certain
enjoyments
containing
an
equal
amount
of
pleasure
it
may
become
apparent
that
the
enjoyment
is
much
better
than
the
pleasure
and
also
in
some
cases
much
worse
in
such
a
case
it
is
plain
that
the
enjoyment
does
owe
its
value
to
the
pleasure
it
contains
although
it
might
easily
have
appeared
to
do
so
when
we
only
considered
the
other
constituents
of
the
enjoyment
and
seemed
to
see
that
without
the
pleasure
they
would
have
had
no
value
it
is
now
apparent
on
the
contrary
that
the
whole
enjoyment
owes
its
value
quite
equally
to
the
presence
of
the
other
constituents
it
may
be
true
that
the
pleasure
is
the
only
constituent
having
any
value
by
itself
and
similarly
if
we
are
told
that
all
things
owe
their
value
solely
to
the
fact
that
they
are
realisations
of
the
true
self
we
may
easily
refute
this
statement
by
asking
whether
the
predicate
that
is
meant
by
realising
the
true
self
supposing
that
it
could
exist
alone
would
have
any
value
whatsoever
either
the
which
does
realise
the
true
self
has
intrinsic
value
or
it
has
not
and
if
it
has
then
it
certainly
does
not
owe
its
value
solely
to
the
fact
that
it
realises
the
true
self
if
now
we
use
this
method
of
absolute
isolation
and
guard
against
these
errors
it
appears
that
the
question
we
have
to
answer
is
far
less
difficult
than
the
controversies
of
ethics
might
have
led
us
to
expect
indeed
once
the
meaning
of
the
question
is
clearly
understood
the
answer
to
it
in
its
main
outlines
appears
to
be
so
obvious
that
it
runs
the
risk
of
seeming
to
be
a
platitude
by
far
the
most
valuable
things
which
we
know
or
can
imagine
are
certain
states
of
consciousness
which
may
be
roughly
described
as
the
pleasures
of
human
intercourse
and
the
enjoyment
of
beautiful
objects
no
one
probably
who
has
asked
himself
the
question
has
ever
doubted
that
personal
affection
and
the
appreciation
of
what
is
beautiful
in
art
or
nature
are
good
in
themselves
nor
if
we
consider
strictly
what
things
are
worth
having
for
their
own
does
it
appear
probable
that
any
one
will
think
that
anything
else
has
so
great
a
value
as
the
things
which
are
included
under
these
two
heads
i
have
myself
urged
in
chap
iii
that
the
mere
existence
of
what
is
beautiful
does
appear
to
have
intrinsic
value
but
i
regard
it
as
indubitable
that
sidgwick
was
so
far
right
in
the
view
there
discussed
that
such
mere
existence
of
what
is
beautiful
has
value
so
small
as
to
be
negligible
in
comparison
with
that
which
attaches
to
the
of
beauty
this
simple
truth
may
indeed
be
said
to
be
universally
recognised
what
has
been
recognised
is
that
it
is
the
ultimate
and
fundamental
truth
of
moral
philosophy
that
it
is
only
for
the
sake
of
these
things
in
order
that
as
much
of
them
as
possible
may
at
some
time
exist
that
any
one
can
be
justified
in
performing
any
public
or
private
duty
that
they
are
the
d
of
virtue
that
it
is
they
these
complex
wholes
and
not
any
constituent
or
characteristic
of
them
that
form
the
rational
ultimate
end
of
human
action
and
the
sole
criterion
of
social
progress
these
appear
to
be
truths
which
have
been
generally
overlooked
that
they
are
truths
that
personal
affections
and
aesthetic
enjoyments
include
the
greatest
and
the
greatest
goods
we
can
imagine
will
i
hope
appear
more
plainly
in
the
course
of
that
analysis
of
them
to
which
i
shall
now
proceed
all
the
things
which
i
have
meant
to
include
under
the
above
descriptions
are
highly
complex
and
in
discussing
the
consequences
which
follow
from
this
fact
and
the
elements
of
which
they
are
composed
i
may
hope
at
the
same
time
both
to
confirm
and
to
define
my
position
i
propose
to
begin
by
examining
what
i
have
called
aesthetic
enjoyments
since
the
case
of
personal
affections
presents
some
additional
complications
it
is
i
think
universally
admitted
that
the
proper
appreciation
of
a
beautiful
object
is
a
good
thing
in
itself
and
my
question
is
what
are
the
main
elements
included
in
such
an
appreciation
it
is
plain
that
in
those
instances
of
aesthetic
appreciation
which
we
think
most
valuable
there
is
included
not
merely
a
bare
cognition
of
what
is
beautiful
in
the
object
but
also
some
kind
of
feeling
or
emotion
it
is
not
sufficient
that
a
man
should
merely
see
the
beautiful
qualities
in
a
picture
and
know
that
they
are
beautiful
in
order
that
we
may
give
his
state
of
mind
the
highest
praise
we
require
that
he
should
also
the
beauty
of
that
which
he
sees
and
which
he
knows
to
be
beautiful
that
he
should
feel
and
see
and
by
these
expressions
we
certainly
mean
that
he
should
have
an
appropriate
emotion
towards
the
beautiful
qualities
which
he
cognises
it
is
perhaps
the
case
that
all
aesthetic
emotions
have
some
common
quality
but
it
is
certain
that
differences
in
the
emotion
seem
to
be
appropriate
to
differences
in
the
kind
of
beauty
perceived
and
by
saying
that
different
emotions
are
to
different
kinds
of
beauty
we
mean
that
the
whole
which
is
formed
by
the
consciousness
of
that
kind
of
beauty
the
emotion
appropriate
to
it
is
better
than
if
any
other
emotion
had
been
felt
in
contemplating
that
particular
beautiful
object
accordingly
we
have
a
large
variety
of
different
emotions
each
of
which
is
a
necessary
constituent
in
some
state
of
consciousness
which
we
judge
to
be
good
all
of
these
emotions
are
essential
elements
in
great
positive
goods
they
are
of
organic
wholes
which
have
great
intrinsic
value
but
it
is
important
to
observe
that
these
wholes
are
organic
and
that
hence
it
does
not
follow
that
the
emotion
would
have
any
value
whatsoever
nor
yet
that
if
it
were
directed
to
a
different
object
the
whole
thus
formed
might
not
be
positively
bad
and
in
fact
it
seems
to
be
the
case
that
if
we
distinguish
the
emotional
element
in
any
aesthetic
appreciation
from
the
cognitive
element
which
accompanies
it
and
is
in
fact
commonly
thought
of
as
a
part
of
the
emotion
and
if
we
consider
what
value
this
emotional
element
would
have
by
we
can
hardly
think
that
it
has
any
great
value
even
if
it
has
any
at
all
whereas
if
the
same
emotion
be
directed
to
a
different
object
if
for
instance
it
is
felt
towards
an
object
that
is
positively
ugly
the
whole
state
of
consciousness
is
certainly
often
positively
bad
in
a
high
degree
in
the
last
paragraph
i
have
pointed
out
the
two
facts
that
the
presence
of
some
emotion
is
necessary
to
give
any
very
high
value
to
a
state
of
aesthetic
appreciation
and
that
on
the
other
hand
this
same
emotion
in
itself
may
have
little
or
no
value
it
follows
that
these
emotions
give
to
the
wholes
of
which
they
form
a
part
a
value
far
greater
than
that
which
they
themselves
possess
the
same
is
obviously
true
of
the
cognitive
element
which
must
be
combined
with
these
emotions
in
order
to
form
these
highly
valuable
wholes
and
the
present
paragraph
will
attempt
to
define
what
is
meant
by
this
cognitive
element
so
far
as
to
guard
against
a
possible
misunderstanding
when
we
talk
of
seeing
a
beautiful
object
or
more
generally
of
the
cognition
or
consciousness
of
a
beautiful
object
we
may
mean
by
these
expressions
something
which
forms
no
part
of
any
valuable
whole
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
use
of
the
term
object
which
has
probably
been
responsible
for
as
many
enormous
errors
in
philosophy
and
psychology
as
any
other
single
cause
this
ambiguity
may
easily
be
detected
by
considering
the
proposition
which
though
a
contradiction
in
terms
is
obviously
true
that
when
a
man
sees
a
beautiful
picture
he
may
see
nothing
beautiful
whatever
the
ambiguity
consists
in
the
fact
that
by
the
object
of
vision
or
cognition
may
be
meant
the
qualities
actually
seen
all
the
qualities
possessed
by
the
thing
seen
thus
in
our
case
when
it
is
said
that
the
picture
is
beautiful
it
is
meant
that
it
contains
qualities
which
are
beautiful
when
it
is
said
that
the
man
sees
the
picture
it
is
meant
that
he
sees
a
great
number
of
the
qualities
contained
in
the
picture
and
when
it
is
said
that
nevertheless
he
sees
nothing
beautiful
it
is
meant
that
he
does
see
those
qualities
of
the
picture
which
are
beautiful
when
therefore
i
speak
of
the
cognition
of
a
beautiful
object
as
an
essential
element
in
a
valuable
aesthetic
appreciation
i
must
be
understood
to
mean
only
the
cognition
of
beautiful
possessed
by
that
object
and
the
cognition
of
other
qualities
of
the
object
possessing
them
and
this
distinction
must
itself
be
carefully
distinguished
from
the
other
distinction
expressed
above
by
the
distinct
terms
seeing
the
beauty
of
a
thing
and
seeing
its
beautiful
by
seeing
the
beauty
of
a
thing
we
commonly
mean
the
having
an
emotion
towards
its
beautiful
qualities
whereas
in
the
seeing
of
its
beautiful
qualities
we
do
not
include
any
emotion
by
the
cognitive
element
which
is
equally
necessary
with
emotion
to
the
existence
of
a
valuable
appreciation
i
mean
merely
the
actual
cognition
or
consciousness
of
any
or
all
of
an
object
s
that
is
to
say
any
or
all
of
those
elements
in
the
object
which
possess
any
positive
beauty
that
such
a
cognitive
element
is
essential
to
a
valuable
whole
may
be
easily
seen
by
asking
what
value
should
we
attribute
to
the
proper
emotion
excited
by
hearing
beethoven
s
fifth
symphony
if
that
emotion
were
entirely
unaccompanied
by
any
consciousness
either
of
the
notes
or
of
the
melodic
and
harmonic
relations
between
them
and
that
the
mere
of
the
symphony
even
accompanied
by
the
appropriate
emotion
is
not
sufficient
may
be
easily
seen
if
we
consider
what
would
be
the
state
of
a
man
who
should
hear
all
the
notes
but
should
be
aware
of
any
of
those
melodic
and
harmonic
relations
which
are
necessary
to
constitute
the
smallest
beautiful
elements
in
the
symphony
connected
with
the
distinction
just
made
between
object
in
the
sense
of
the
qualities
actually
before
the
mind
and
object
in
the
sense
of
the
whole
thing
which
possesses
the
qualities
actually
before
the
mind
is
another
distinction
of
the
utmost
importance
for
a
correct
analysis
of
the
constituents
necessary
to
a
valuable
whole
it
is
commonly
and
rightly
thought
that
to
see
beauty
in
a
thing
which
has
no
beauty
is
in
some
way
inferior
to
seeing
beauty
in
that
which
really
has
it
but
under
this
single
description
of
seeing
beauty
in
that
which
has
no
beauty
two
very
different
facts
and
facts
of
very
different
value
may
be
included
we
may
mean
the
attribution
to
an
object
of
really
beautiful
qualities
which
it
does
not
possess
the
feeling
towards
qualities
which
the
object
does
possess
but
which
are
in
reality
not
beautiful
an
emotion
which
is
appropriate
only
to
qualities
really
beautiful
both
these
facts
are
of
very
frequent
occurrence
and
in
most
instances
of
emotion
both
no
doubt
occur
together
but
they
are
obviously
quite
distinct
and
the
distinction
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
a
correct
estimate
of
values
the
former
may
be
called
an
error
of
judgment
and
the
latter
an
error
of
taste
but
it
is
important
to
observe
that
the
error
of
taste
commonly
involves
a
false
judgment
whereas
the
error
of
judgment
is
merely
a
false
judgment
now
the
case
which
i
have
called
an
error
of
taste
namely
where
the
actual
qualities
we
admire
whether
possessed
by
the
object
or
not
are
ugly
can
in
any
case
have
no
value
except
such
as
may
belong
to
the
emotion
and
in
most
if
not
in
all
cases
it
is
a
considerable
positive
evil
in
this
sense
then
it
is
undoubtedly
right
to
think
that
seeing
beauty
in
a
thing
which
has
no
beauty
is
inferior
in
value
to
seeing
beauty
where
beauty
really
is
but
the
other
case
is
much
more
difficult
in
this
case
there
is
present
all
that
i
have
hitherto
mentioned
as
necessary
to
constitute
a
great
positive
good
there
is
a
cognition
of
qualities
really
beautiful
together
with
an
appropriate
emotion
towards
these
qualities
there
can
therefore
be
no
doubt
that
we
have
here
a
great
positive
good
but
there
is
present
also
something
else
namely
a
belief
that
these
beautiful
qualities
exist
and
that
they
exist
in
a
certain
relation
to
other
things
namely
to
some
properties
of
the
object
to
which
we
attribute
these
qualities
and
further
the
object
of
this
belief
is
false
and
we
may
ask
with
regard
to
the
whole
thus
constituted
whether
the
presence
of
the
belief
and
the
fact
that
what
is
believed
is
false
make
any
difference
to
its
value
we
thus
get
three
different
cases
of
which
it
is
very
important
to
determine
the
relative
values
where
both
the
cognition
of
beautiful
qualities
and
the
appropriate
emotion
are
present
we
may
have
either
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
these
qualities
of
which
the
object
that
they
exist
is
true
or
a
mere
cognition
without
belief
when
it
is
true
false
that
the
object
of
the
cognition
the
beautiful
qualities
exists
or
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
the
beautiful
qualities
when
they
do
not
exist
the
importance
of
these
cases
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
second
defines
the
pleasures
of
imagination
including
a
great
part
of
the
appreciation
of
those
works
of
art
which
are
whereas
the
first
contrasts
with
these
the
appreciation
of
what
is
beautiful
in
nature
and
the
human
affections
the
third
on
the
other
hand
is
contrasted
with
both
in
that
it
is
chiefly
exemplified
in
what
is
called
misdirected
affection
and
it
is
possible
also
that
the
love
of
god
in
the
case
of
a
believer
should
fall
under
this
head
now
all
these
three
cases
as
i
have
said
have
something
in
common
namely
that
in
them
all
we
have
a
cognition
of
really
beautiful
qualities
together
with
an
appropriate
emotion
towards
those
qualities
i
think
therefore
it
can
not
be
doubted
nor
is
it
commonly
doubted
that
all
three
include
great
positive
goods
they
are
all
things
of
which
we
feel
convinced
that
they
are
worth
having
for
their
own
sakes
and
i
think
that
the
value
of
the
second
in
either
of
its
two
subdivisions
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
value
of
the
element
common
to
all
three
in
other
words
in
the
case
of
purely
imaginative
appreciations
we
have
merely
the
cognition
of
really
beautiful
qualities
together
with
the
appropriate
emotion
and
the
question
whether
the
object
cognised
exists
or
not
seems
here
where
there
is
no
belief
either
in
its
existence
or
in
its
to
make
absolutely
no
difference
to
the
value
of
the
total
state
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
two
other
cases
do
differ
in
intrinsic
value
both
from
this
one
and
from
one
another
even
though
the
object
cognised
and
the
appropriate
emotion
should
be
identical
in
all
three
cases
i
think
that
the
additional
presence
of
a
belief
in
the
reality
of
the
object
makes
the
total
state
much
better
if
the
belief
is
true
and
worse
if
the
belief
is
false
in
short
where
there
is
belief
in
the
sense
in
which
we
believe
in
the
existence
of
nature
and
horses
and
do
believe
in
the
existence
of
an
ideal
landscape
and
unicorns
the
of
what
is
believed
does
make
a
great
difference
to
the
value
of
the
organic
whole
if
this
be
the
case
we
shall
have
vindicated
the
belief
that
in
the
ordinary
sense
as
distinguished
on
the
one
hand
from
belief
in
what
is
false
and
on
the
other
from
the
mere
awareness
of
what
is
true
does
contribute
towards
intrinsic
value
that
at
least
in
some
cases
its
presence
as
a
part
makes
a
whole
more
valuable
than
it
could
have
been
without
now
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
we
do
judge
that
there
is
a
difference
of
value
such
as
i
have
indicated
between
the
three
cases
in
question
we
do
think
that
the
emotional
contemplation
of
a
natural
scene
supposing
its
qualities
equally
beautiful
is
in
some
way
a
better
state
of
things
than
that
of
a
painted
landscape
we
think
that
the
world
would
be
improved
if
we
could
substitute
for
the
best
works
of
representative
art
objects
equally
beautiful
and
similarly
we
regard
a
misdirected
affection
or
admiration
even
where
the
error
involved
is
a
mere
error
of
judgment
and
not
an
error
of
taste
as
in
some
way
unfortunate
and
further
those
at
least
who
have
a
strong
respect
for
truth
are
inclined
to
think
that
a
merely
poetical
contemplation
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
superior
to
that
of
the
religious
believer
it
were
the
case
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
does
not
and
will
not
really
exist
most
persons
on
a
sober
reflective
judgment
would
feel
some
hesitation
even
in
preferring
the
felicity
of
a
madman
convinced
that
the
world
was
ideal
to
the
condition
either
of
a
poet
imagining
an
ideal
world
or
of
themselves
enjoying
and
appreciating
the
lesser
goods
which
do
and
will
exist
but
in
order
to
assure
ourselves
that
these
judgments
are
really
judgments
of
intrinsic
value
upon
the
question
before
us
and
to
satisfy
ourselves
that
they
are
correct
it
is
necessary
clearly
to
distinguish
our
question
from
two
others
which
have
a
very
important
bearing
upon
our
total
judgment
of
the
cases
in
question
in
the
first
place
it
is
plain
that
where
we
believe
the
question
whether
what
we
believe
is
true
or
false
will
generally
have
a
most
important
bearing
upon
the
value
of
our
belief
a
where
we
believe
we
are
apt
to
act
upon
our
belief
in
a
way
in
which
we
do
not
act
upon
our
cognition
of
the
events
in
a
novel
the
truth
of
what
we
believe
is
therefore
very
important
as
preventing
the
pains
of
disappointment
and
still
more
serious
consequences
and
it
might
be
thought
that
a
misdirected
attachment
was
unfortunate
solely
for
this
reason
that
it
leads
us
to
count
upon
results
which
the
real
nature
of
its
object
is
not
of
a
kind
to
ensure
so
too
the
love
of
god
where
as
usual
it
includes
the
belief
that
he
will
annex
to
certain
actions
consequences
either
in
this
life
or
the
next
which
the
course
of
nature
gives
no
reason
to
expect
may
lead
the
believer
to
perform
actions
of
which
the
actual
consequences
supposing
no
such
god
to
exist
may
be
much
worse
than
he
might
otherwise
have
effected
and
it
might
be
thought
that
this
was
the
sole
reason
as
it
is
a
sufficient
one
why
we
should
hesitate
to
encourage
the
love
of
god
in
the
absence
of
any
proof
that
he
exists
and
similarly
it
may
be
thought
that
the
only
reason
why
beauty
in
nature
should
be
held
superior
to
an
equally
beautiful
landscape
or
imagination
is
that
its
existence
would
ensure
greater
permanence
and
frequency
in
our
emotional
contemplation
of
that
beauty
it
is
indeed
certain
that
the
chief
importance
of
most
of
the
truth
of
most
of
the
things
which
we
believe
does
in
this
world
consist
in
its
extrinsic
advantages
it
is
immensely
valuable
a
and
secondly
it
may
be
the
case
that
the
existence
of
that
which
we
contemplate
is
itself
a
great
positive
good
so
that
for
this
reason
alone
the
state
of
things
described
by
saying
that
the
object
of
our
emotion
really
exists
would
be
intrinsically
superior
to
that
in
which
it
did
not
this
reason
for
superiority
is
undoubtedly
of
great
importance
in
the
case
of
human
affections
where
the
object
of
our
admiration
is
the
mental
qualities
of
an
admirable
person
for
that
such
admirable
persons
should
exist
is
greatly
better
than
that
there
should
be
only
one
and
it
would
also
discriminate
the
admiration
of
inanimate
nature
from
that
of
its
representations
in
art
in
so
far
as
we
may
allow
a
small
intrinsic
value
to
the
existence
of
a
beautiful
object
apart
from
any
contemplation
of
it
but
it
is
to
be
noticed
that
this
reason
would
not
account
for
any
difference
in
value
between
the
cases
where
the
truth
was
believed
and
that
in
which
it
was
merely
cognised
without
either
belief
or
disbelief
in
other
words
so
far
as
this
reason
goes
the
difference
between
the
two
subdivisions
of
our
second
class
that
of
imaginative
contemplation
would
be
as
great
as
between
our
first
class
and
the
second
subdivision
of
our
second
the
superiority
of
the
mere
of
a
beautiful
object
when
that
object
also
happened
to
exist
over
the
same
cognition
when
the
object
did
not
exist
would
on
this
count
be
as
great
as
that
of
the
of
a
beautiful
object
over
the
mere
imagination
of
it
these
two
reasons
for
discriminating
between
the
value
of
the
three
cases
we
are
considering
must
i
say
be
carefully
distinguished
from
that
of
which
i
am
now
questioning
the
validity
if
we
are
to
obtain
a
correct
answer
concerning
this
latter
the
question
i
am
putting
is
this
whether
the
constituted
by
the
fact
that
there
is
an
emotional
contemplation
of
a
beautiful
object
which
both
is
believed
to
be
and
is
does
not
derive
some
of
its
value
from
the
fact
that
the
object
real
i
am
asking
whether
the
value
of
this
whole
a
is
not
greater
than
that
of
those
which
differ
from
it
by
the
absence
of
belief
with
or
without
truth
belief
being
present
by
the
mere
absence
of
truth
i
am
not
asking
whether
it
is
not
superior
to
them
as
a
means
which
it
certainly
is
whether
it
may
not
contain
a
more
valuable
namely
the
existence
of
the
object
in
question
my
question
is
solely
whether
the
existence
of
its
object
does
not
constitute
an
addition
to
the
value
of
the
whole
quite
distinct
from
the
addition
constituted
by
the
fact
that
this
whole
does
contain
a
valuable
part
if
now
we
put
this
question
i
can
not
avoid
thinking
that
it
should
receive
an
affirmative
answer
we
can
put
it
clearly
by
the
method
of
isolation
and
the
sole
decision
must
rest
with
our
reflective
judgment
upon
it
as
thus
clearly
put
we
can
guard
against
the
bias
produced
by
a
consideration
of
value
a
by
supposing
the
case
of
an
illusion
as
complete
and
permanent
as
illusions
in
this
world
never
can
be
we
can
imagine
the
case
of
a
single
person
enjoying
throughout
eternity
the
contemplation
of
scenery
as
beautiful
and
intercourse
with
persons
as
admirable
as
can
be
imagined
while
yet
the
whole
of
the
objects
of
his
cognition
are
absolutely
unreal
i
think
we
should
definitely
pronounce
the
existence
of
a
universe
which
consisted
solely
of
such
a
person
to
be
inferior
in
value
to
one
in
which
the
objects
in
the
existence
of
which
he
believes
did
really
exist
just
as
he
believes
them
to
do
and
that
it
would
be
thus
inferior
because
it
would
lack
the
goods
which
consist
in
the
existence
of
the
objects
in
question
but
merely
because
his
belief
would
be
false
that
it
would
be
inferior
this
reason
follows
if
we
admit
what
also
appears
to
me
certain
that
the
case
of
a
person
merely
imagining
without
believing
the
beautiful
objects
in
question
would
these
objects
really
be
yet
inferior
to
that
of
the
person
who
also
believed
in
their
existence
for
here
all
the
additional
good
which
consists
in
the
existence
of
the
objects
is
present
and
yet
there
still
seems
to
be
a
great
difference
in
value
between
this
case
and
that
in
which
their
existence
is
believed
but
i
think
that
my
conclusion
may
perhaps
be
exhibited
in
a
more
convincing
light
by
the
following
considerations
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
the
small
degree
of
value
which
we
may
allow
to
the
existence
of
beautiful
inanimate
objects
is
nearly
equal
in
amount
to
the
difference
which
i
feel
that
there
is
between
the
appreciation
accompanied
by
belief
of
such
objects
when
they
really
exist
and
the
purely
imaginative
appreciation
of
them
when
they
do
not
exist
this
inequality
is
more
difficult
to
verify
where
the
object
is
an
admirable
person
since
a
value
must
be
allowed
to
his
existence
but
yet
i
think
it
is
not
paradoxical
to
maintain
that
the
superiority
of
reciprocal
affection
where
both
objects
are
worthy
and
both
exist
over
an
unreciprocated
affection
where
both
are
worthy
but
one
does
not
exist
does
not
lie
solely
in
the
fact
that
in
the
former
case
we
have
two
good
things
instead
of
one
but
also
in
the
fact
that
each
is
such
as
the
other
believes
him
to
be
it
seems
to
me
that
the
important
contribution
to
value
made
by
true
belief
may
be
very
plainly
seen
in
the
following
case
suppose
that
a
worthy
object
of
affection
does
really
exist
and
is
believed
to
do
so
but
that
there
enters
into
the
case
this
error
of
fact
that
the
qualities
loved
though
exactly
like
are
yet
not
the
which
really
do
exist
this
state
of
things
is
easily
imagined
and
i
think
we
can
not
avoid
pronouncing
that
both
persons
here
exist
it
is
yet
not
so
satisfactory
as
where
the
very
person
loved
and
believed
to
exist
is
also
the
one
which
actually
does
exist
if
all
this
be
so
we
have
in
this
third
section
added
to
our
two
former
results
the
third
result
that
a
true
belief
in
the
reality
of
an
object
greatly
increases
the
value
of
many
valuable
wholes
just
as
in
sections
and
it
was
maintained
that
aesthetic
and
affectionate
emotions
had
little
or
no
value
apart
from
the
cognition
of
appropriate
objects
and
that
the
cognition
of
these
objects
had
little
or
no
value
apart
from
the
appropriate
emotion
so
that
the
whole
in
which
both
were
combined
had
a
value
greatly
in
excess
of
the
sum
of
the
values
of
its
parts
so
according
to
this
section
if
there
be
added
to
these
wholes
a
true
belief
in
the
reality
of
the
object
the
new
whole
thus
formed
has
a
value
greatly
in
excess
of
the
sum
obtained
by
adding
the
value
of
the
true
belief
considered
in
itself
to
that
of
our
original
wholes
this
new
case
only
differs
from
the
former
in
this
that
whereas
the
true
belief
by
itself
has
quite
as
little
value
as
either
of
the
two
other
constituents
taken
singly
yet
they
taken
together
seem
to
form
a
whole
of
very
great
value
whereas
this
is
not
the
case
with
the
two
wholes
which
might
be
formed
by
adding
the
true
belief
to
either
of
the
others
the
importance
of
the
result
of
this
section
seems
to
lie
mainly
in
two
of
its
consequences
that
it
affords
some
justification
for
the
immense
intrinsic
value
which
seems
to
be
commonly
attributed
to
the
mere
of
some
truths
and
which
was
expressly
attributed
to
some
kinds
of
knowledge
by
plato
and
aristotle
perfect
knowledge
has
indeed
competed
with
perfect
love
for
the
position
of
ideal
if
the
results
of
this
section
are
correct
it
appears
that
knowledge
though
having
little
or
no
value
by
itself
is
an
absolutely
essential
constituent
in
the
highest
goods
and
contributes
immensely
to
their
value
and
it
appears
that
this
function
may
be
performed
not
only
by
that
case
of
knowledge
which
we
have
chiefly
considered
namely
knowledge
of
the
reality
of
the
beautiful
object
cognised
but
also
by
knowledge
of
the
numerical
identity
of
this
object
with
that
which
really
exists
and
by
the
knowledge
that
the
existence
of
that
object
is
truly
good
indeed
all
knowledge
which
is
directly
concerned
with
the
nature
of
the
constituents
of
a
beautiful
object
would
seem
capable
of
adding
greatly
to
the
value
of
the
contemplation
of
that
object
although
by
itself
such
knowledge
would
have
no
value
at
and
the
second
important
consequence
which
follows
from
this
section
is
that
the
presence
of
true
belief
may
in
spite
of
a
great
inferiority
in
the
value
of
the
emotion
and
the
beauty
of
its
object
constitute
with
them
a
whole
equal
or
superior
in
value
to
wholes
in
which
the
emotion
and
beauty
are
superior
but
in
which
a
true
belief
is
wanting
or
a
false
belief
present
in
this
way
we
may
justify
the
attribution
of
equal
or
superior
value
to
an
appreciation
of
an
inferior
real
object
as
compared
with
the
appreciation
of
a
greatly
superior
object
which
is
a
mere
creature
of
the
imagination
thus
a
just
appreciation
of
nature
and
of
real
persons
may
maintain
its
equality
with
an
equally
just
appreciation
of
the
products
of
artistic
imagination
in
spite
of
much
greater
beauty
in
the
latter
and
similarly
though
god
may
be
admitted
to
be
a
more
perfect
object
than
any
actual
human
being
the
love
of
god
may
yet
be
inferior
to
human
love
god
does
not
exist
in
order
to
complete
the
discussion
of
this
first
class
of
goods
goods
which
have
an
essential
reference
to
objects
it
would
be
necessary
to
attempt
a
classification
and
comparative
valuation
of
all
the
different
forms
of
beauty
a
task
which
properly
belongs
to
the
study
called
aesthetics
i
do
not
however
propose
to
attempt
any
part
of
this
task
it
must
only
be
understood
that
i
intend
to
include
among
the
essential
constituents
of
the
goods
i
have
been
discussing
every
form
and
variety
of
beautiful
object
if
only
it
be
truly
beautiful
and
this
be
understood
i
think
it
may
be
seen
that
the
consensus
of
opinion
with
regard
to
what
is
positively
beautiful
and
what
is
positively
ugly
and
even
with
regard
to
great
differences
in
degree
of
beauty
is
quite
sufficient
to
allow
us
a
hope
that
we
need
not
greatly
err
in
our
judgments
of
good
and
evil
in
anything
which
is
thought
beautiful
by
any
considerable
number
of
persons
there
is
probably
beautiful
quality
and
differences
of
opinion
seem
to
be
far
more
often
due
to
exclusive
attention
on
the
part
of
different
persons
to
different
qualities
in
the
same
object
than
to
the
positive
error
of
supposing
a
quality
that
is
ugly
to
be
really
beautiful
when
an
object
which
some
think
beautiful
is
denied
to
be
so
by
others
the
truth
is
that
it
lacks
some
beautiful
quality
or
is
deformed
by
some
ugly
one
which
engage
the
exclusive
attention
of
the
critics
i
may
however
state
two
general
principles
closely
connected
with
the
results
of
this
chapter
the
recognition
of
which
would
seem
to
be
of
great
importance
for
the
investigation
of
what
things
are
truly
beautiful
the
first
of
these
is
a
definition
of
beauty
of
what
is
meant
by
saying
that
a
thing
is
truly
beautiful
the
naturalistic
fallacy
has
been
quite
as
commonly
committed
with
regard
to
beauty
as
with
regard
to
good
its
use
has
introduced
as
many
errors
into
aesthetics
as
into
ethics
it
has
been
even
more
commonly
supposed
that
the
beautiful
may
be
as
that
which
produces
certain
effects
upon
our
feelings
and
the
conclusion
which
follows
from
this
namely
that
judgments
of
taste
are
merely
that
precisely
the
same
thing
may
according
to
circumstances
be
beautiful
not
beautiful
has
very
frequently
been
drawn
the
conclusions
of
this
chapter
suggest
a
definition
of
beauty
which
may
partially
explain
and
entirely
remove
the
difficulties
which
have
led
to
this
error
it
appears
probable
that
the
beautiful
should
be
as
that
of
which
the
admiring
contemplation
is
good
in
itself
that
is
to
say
to
assert
that
a
thing
is
beautiful
is
to
assert
that
the
cognition
of
it
is
an
essential
element
in
one
of
the
intrinsically
valuable
wholes
we
have
been
discussing
so
that
the
question
whether
it
is
beautiful
or
not
depends
upon
the
question
whether
the
whole
in
question
is
or
is
not
truly
good
and
does
not
depend
upon
the
question
whether
it
would
or
would
not
excite
particular
feelings
in
particular
persons
this
definition
has
the
double
recommendation
that
it
accounts
both
for
the
apparent
connection
between
goodness
and
beauty
and
for
the
no
less
apparent
difference
between
these
two
conceptions
it
appears
at
first
sight
to
be
a
strange
coincidence
that
there
should
be
two
objective
predicates
of
value
good
and
beautiful
which
are
nevertheless
so
related
to
one
another
that
whatever
is
beautiful
is
also
good
but
if
our
definition
be
correct
the
strangeness
disappears
since
it
leaves
only
one
predicate
of
value
namely
good
while
beautiful
though
not
identical
with
is
to
be
defined
by
reference
to
this
being
thus
at
the
same
time
different
from
and
necessarily
connected
with
it
in
short
on
this
view
to
say
that
a
thing
is
beautiful
is
to
say
not
indeed
that
it
is
good
but
that
it
is
a
necessary
element
in
something
which
is
to
prove
that
a
thing
is
truly
beautiful
is
to
prove
that
a
whole
to
which
it
bears
a
particular
relation
as
a
part
is
truly
good
and
in
this
way
we
should
explain
the
immense
predominance
among
objects
commonly
considered
beautiful
of
objects
objects
of
the
external
senses
since
these
objects
though
themselves
having
as
has
been
said
little
or
no
intrinsic
value
are
yet
essential
constituents
in
the
largest
group
of
wholes
which
have
intrinsic
value
these
wholes
themselves
may
be
and
are
also
beautiful
but
the
comparative
rarity
with
which
we
regard
them
as
themselves
of
contemplation
seems
sufficient
to
explain
the
association
of
beauty
with
external
objects
and
secondly
it
is
to
be
observed
that
beautiful
objects
are
themselves
for
the
most
part
organic
unities
in
this
sense
that
they
are
wholes
of
great
complexity
such
that
the
contemplation
of
any
part
by
itself
may
have
no
value
and
yet
that
unless
the
contemplation
of
the
whole
includes
the
contemplation
of
that
part
it
will
lose
in
value
from
this
it
follows
that
there
can
be
no
single
criterion
of
beauty
it
will
never
be
true
to
say
this
object
owes
its
beauty
to
the
presence
of
this
characteristic
nor
yet
that
wherever
this
characteristic
is
present
the
object
must
be
beautiful
all
that
can
be
true
is
that
certain
objects
are
beautiful
they
have
certain
characteristics
in
the
sense
that
they
would
not
be
beautiful
they
had
them
and
it
may
be
possible
to
find
that
certain
characteristics
are
more
or
less
universally
present
in
all
beautiful
objects
and
are
in
this
sense
more
or
less
important
conditions
of
beauty
but
it
is
important
to
observe
that
the
very
qualities
which
differentiate
one
beautiful
object
from
all
others
are
if
the
object
be
truly
beautiful
as
to
its
beauty
as
those
which
it
has
in
common
with
ever
so
many
others
the
object
would
no
more
have
the
beauty
it
has
without
its
specific
qualities
than
without
those
that
are
generic
and
the
generic
qualities
would
fail
as
completely
to
give
beauty
as
those
which
are
specific
ii
it
will
be
remembered
that
i
began
this
survey
of
great
unmixed
goods
by
dividing
all
the
greatest
goods
we
know
into
the
two
classes
of
aesthetic
enjoyments
on
the
one
hand
and
the
pleasures
of
human
intercourse
or
of
personal
affection
on
the
other
i
postponed
the
consideration
of
the
latter
on
the
ground
that
they
presented
additional
complications
in
what
this
additional
complication
consists
will
now
be
evident
and
i
have
already
been
obliged
to
take
account
of
it
in
discussing
the
contribution
to
value
made
by
true
belief
it
consists
in
the
fact
that
in
the
case
of
personal
affection
the
object
itself
is
not
beautiful
while
possessed
of
little
or
no
intrinsic
value
but
is
itself
in
part
at
least
of
great
intrinsic
value
all
the
constituents
which
we
have
found
to
be
necessary
to
the
most
valuable
aesthetic
enjoyments
namely
appropriate
emotion
cognition
of
truly
beautiful
qualities
and
true
belief
are
equally
necessary
here
but
here
we
have
the
additional
fact
that
the
object
must
be
not
only
truly
beautiful
but
also
truly
good
in
a
high
degree
it
is
evident
that
this
additional
complication
only
occurs
in
so
far
as
there
is
included
in
the
object
of
personal
affection
some
of
the
qualities
of
the
person
towards
whom
the
affection
is
felt
and
i
think
it
may
be
admitted
that
wherever
the
affection
is
most
valuable
the
appreciation
of
mental
qualities
must
form
a
large
part
of
it
and
that
the
presence
of
this
part
makes
the
whole
far
more
valuable
than
it
could
have
been
without
it
but
it
seems
very
doubtful
whether
this
appreciation
by
itself
can
possess
as
much
value
as
the
whole
in
which
it
is
combined
with
an
appreciation
of
the
appropriate
expression
of
the
mental
qualities
in
question
it
is
certain
that
in
all
actual
cases
of
valuable
affection
the
bodily
expressions
of
character
whether
by
looks
by
words
or
by
actions
do
form
a
part
of
the
object
towards
which
the
affection
is
felt
and
that
the
fact
of
their
inclusion
appears
to
heighten
the
value
of
the
whole
state
it
is
indeed
very
difficult
to
imagine
what
the
cognition
of
mental
qualities
unaccompanied
by
corporeal
expression
would
be
like
and
in
so
far
as
we
succeed
in
making
this
abstraction
the
whole
considered
certainly
appears
to
have
less
value
i
therefore
conclude
that
the
importance
of
an
admiration
of
admirable
mental
qualities
lies
chiefly
in
the
immense
superiority
of
a
whole
in
which
it
forms
a
part
to
one
in
which
it
is
absent
and
not
in
any
high
degree
of
intrinsic
value
which
it
possesses
by
itself
it
even
appears
to
be
doubtful
whether
in
itself
it
possesses
so
much
value
as
the
appreciation
of
mere
corporeal
beauty
undoubtedly
does
possess
that
is
to
say
whether
the
appreciation
of
what
has
great
intrinsic
value
is
so
valuable
as
the
appreciation
of
what
is
merely
beautiful
but
further
if
we
consider
the
nature
of
admirable
mental
qualities
by
themselves
it
appears
that
a
proper
appreciation
of
them
involves
a
reference
to
purely
material
beauty
in
yet
another
way
admirable
mental
qualities
do
if
our
previous
conclusions
are
correct
consist
very
largely
in
an
emotional
contemplation
of
beautiful
objects
and
hence
the
appreciation
of
them
will
consist
essentially
in
the
contemplation
of
such
contemplation
it
is
true
that
the
most
valuable
appreciation
of
persons
appears
to
be
that
which
consists
in
the
appreciation
of
their
appreciation
of
other
persons
but
even
here
a
reference
to
material
beauty
appears
to
be
involved
in
respect
of
the
fact
that
what
is
appreciated
in
the
last
instance
may
be
the
contemplation
of
what
is
merely
beautiful
in
respect
of
the
fact
that
the
most
valuable
appreciation
of
a
person
appears
to
an
appreciation
of
his
corporeal
expression
though
therefore
we
may
admit
that
the
appreciation
of
a
person
s
attitude
towards
other
persons
or
to
take
one
instance
the
love
of
love
is
far
the
most
valuable
good
we
know
and
far
more
valuable
than
the
mere
love
of
beauty
yet
we
can
only
admit
this
if
the
first
be
understood
to
the
latter
in
various
degrees
of
directness
with
regard
to
the
question
what
the
mental
qualities
of
which
the
cognition
is
essential
to
the
value
of
human
intercourse
it
is
plain
that
they
include
in
the
first
place
all
those
varieties
of
aesthetic
appreciation
which
formed
our
first
class
of
goods
they
include
therefore
a
great
variety
of
different
emotions
each
of
which
is
appropriate
to
some
different
kind
of
beauty
but
we
must
now
add
to
these
the
whole
range
of
emotions
which
are
appropriate
to
persons
and
which
are
different
from
those
which
are
appropriate
to
mere
corporeal
beauty
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
just
as
these
emotions
have
little
value
in
themselves
and
as
the
state
of
mind
in
which
they
exist
may
have
its
value
greatly
heightened
or
may
entirely
lose
it
and
become
positively
evil
in
a
great
degree
according
as
the
cognitions
accompanying
the
emotions
are
appropriate
or
inappropriate
so
too
the
appreciation
of
these
emotions
though
it
may
have
some
value
in
itself
may
yet
form
part
of
a
whole
which
has
far
greater
value
or
no
value
at
all
according
as
it
is
or
is
not
accompanied
by
a
perception
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
emotions
to
their
objects
it
is
obvious
therefore
that
the
study
of
what
is
valuable
in
human
intercourse
is
a
study
of
immense
complexity
and
that
there
may
be
much
human
intercourse
which
has
little
or
no
value
or
is
positively
bad
yet
here
too
as
with
the
question
what
is
beautiful
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
that
a
reflective
judgment
will
in
the
main
decide
correctly
both
as
to
what
are
positive
goods
and
even
as
to
any
differences
in
value
between
these
goods
in
particular
it
may
be
remarked
that
the
emotions
of
which
the
contemplation
is
essential
to
the
greatest
values
and
which
are
also
themselves
appropriately
excited
by
such
contemplation
appear
to
be
those
which
are
commonly
most
highly
prized
under
the
name
of
affection
i
have
now
completed
my
examination
into
the
nature
of
those
great
positive
goods
which
do
not
appear
to
include
among
their
constituents
anything
positively
evil
or
ugly
though
they
include
much
which
is
in
itself
indifferent
and
i
wish
to
point
out
certain
conclusions
which
appear
to
follow
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
summum
bonum
or
that
state
of
things
which
would
be
the
most
perfect
we
can
conceive
those
idealistic
philosophers
whose
views
agree
most
closely
with
those
here
advocated
in
that
they
deny
pleasure
to
be
the
sole
good
and
regard
what
is
completely
good
as
having
some
complexity
have
usually
represented
a
purely
spiritual
state
of
existence
as
the
ideal
regarding
matter
as
essentially
imperfect
if
not
positively
evil
they
have
concluded
that
the
total
absence
of
all
material
properties
is
necessary
to
a
state
of
perfection
now
according
to
what
has
been
said
this
view
would
be
correct
so
far
as
it
asserts
that
any
great
good
must
be
and
so
far
as
it
asserts
that
a
purely
material
existence
can
have
little
or
no
value
the
superiority
of
the
spiritual
over
the
material
has
in
a
sense
been
amply
vindicated
but
it
does
not
follow
from
this
superiority
that
a
perfect
state
of
things
must
be
one
from
which
all
material
properties
are
rigidly
excluded
on
the
contrary
if
our
conclusions
are
correct
it
would
seem
to
be
the
case
that
a
state
of
things
in
which
they
are
included
must
be
vastly
better
than
any
conceivable
state
in
which
they
were
absent
in
order
to
see
that
this
is
so
the
chief
thing
necessary
to
be
considered
is
what
it
which
we
declare
to
be
good
when
we
declare
that
the
appreciation
of
beauty
in
art
and
nature
is
so
that
this
appreciation
good
the
philosophers
in
question
do
not
for
the
most
part
deny
but
if
we
admit
it
then
we
should
remember
butler
s
maxim
that
everything
is
what
it
is
and
not
another
thing
i
have
tried
to
shew
and
i
think
it
is
too
evident
to
be
disputed
that
such
appreciation
is
an
organic
unity
a
complex
whole
and
that
in
its
most
undoubted
instances
part
of
what
is
included
in
this
whole
is
cognition
of
material
and
particularly
of
a
vast
variety
of
what
are
called
qualities
if
then
it
is
whole
which
we
know
to
be
good
and
not
another
thing
then
we
know
that
material
qualities
even
though
they
be
perfectly
worthless
in
themselves
are
yet
essential
constituents
of
what
is
far
from
worthless
what
we
know
to
be
valuable
is
the
apprehension
of
just
these
qualities
and
not
of
any
others
and
if
we
propose
to
subtract
them
from
it
then
what
we
have
left
is
that
which
we
know
to
have
value
but
something
else
and
it
must
be
noticed
that
this
conclusion
holds
even
if
my
contention
that
a
true
belief
in
the
existence
of
these
qualities
adds
to
the
value
of
the
whole
in
which
it
is
included
be
disputed
we
should
then
indeed
be
entitled
to
assert
that
the
of
a
material
world
was
wholly
immaterial
to
perfection
but
the
fact
that
what
we
knew
to
be
good
was
a
cognition
of
though
purely
imaginary
would
still
remain
it
must
then
be
admitted
on
pain
of
on
pain
of
holding
that
things
are
not
what
they
are
but
something
else
that
a
world
from
which
material
qualities
were
wholly
banished
would
be
a
world
which
lacked
many
if
not
all
of
those
things
which
we
know
most
certainly
to
be
great
goods
that
it
nevertheless
be
a
far
better
world
than
one
which
retained
these
goods
i
have
already
admitted
but
in
order
to
shew
that
any
such
world
be
thus
better
it
would
be
necessary
to
shew
that
the
retention
of
these
things
though
good
in
themselves
impaired
in
a
more
than
equal
degree
the
value
of
some
whole
to
which
they
might
belong
and
the
task
of
shewing
this
has
certainly
never
been
attempted
until
it
be
performed
we
are
entitled
to
assert
that
material
qualities
are
a
necessary
constituent
of
the
ideal
that
though
something
utterly
unknown
be
better
than
any
world
containing
either
them
or
any
other
good
we
know
yet
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
anything
whatever
would
be
better
than
a
state
of
things
in
which
they
were
included
to
deny
and
exclude
matter
is
to
deny
and
exclude
the
best
we
know
that
a
thing
may
retain
its
value
while
losing
some
of
its
qualities
is
utterly
untrue
all
that
is
true
is
that
the
changed
thing
may
have
more
value
than
or
as
much
value
as
that
of
which
the
qualities
have
been
lost
what
i
contend
is
that
nothing
which
we
to
be
good
and
which
contains
no
material
qualities
has
such
great
value
that
we
can
declare
it
to
be
superior
to
the
whole
which
would
be
formed
by
the
addition
to
it
of
an
appreciation
of
material
qualities
that
a
spiritual
good
may
be
the
of
single
things
i
am
not
much
concerned
to
dispute
although
in
what
has
been
said
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
personal
affection
i
have
given
reasons
for
doubting
it
but
that
by
adding
to
it
some
appreciation
of
material
qualities
which
though
perhaps
inferior
by
itself
is
certainly
a
great
positive
good
we
should
obtain
a
greater
sum
of
value
which
no
corresponding
decrease
in
the
value
of
the
whole
as
a
whole
could
counterbalance
this
i
maintain
we
have
certainly
no
reason
to
doubt
in
order
to
complete
this
discussion
of
the
main
principles
involved
in
the
determination
of
intrinsic
values
the
chief
remaining
topics
necessary
to
be
treated
appear
to
be
two
the
first
of
these
is
the
nature
of
great
intrinsic
including
what
i
may
call
evils
that
is
to
say
those
evil
wholes
which
nevertheless
contain
as
essential
elements
something
positively
good
or
beautiful
and
the
second
is
the
nature
of
what
i
may
similarly
call
goods
that
is
to
say
those
wholes
which
though
intrinsically
good
nevertheless
contain
as
essential
elements
something
positively
evil
or
ugly
it
will
greatly
facilitate
this
discussion
if
i
may
be
understood
throughout
to
use
the
terms
beautiful
and
ugly
not
necessarily
with
reference
to
things
of
the
kind
which
most
naturally
occur
to
us
as
instances
of
what
is
beautiful
and
ugly
but
in
accordance
with
my
own
proposed
definition
of
beauty
thus
i
shall
use
the
word
beautiful
to
denote
that
of
which
the
admiring
contemplation
is
good
in
itself
and
ugly
to
denote
that
of
which
the
admiring
contemplation
is
evil
in
itself
i
with
regard
then
to
great
positive
evils
i
think
it
is
evident
that
if
we
take
all
due
precautions
to
discover
those
things
are
of
which
they
existed
absolutely
by
we
should
judge
the
existence
to
be
a
great
evil
we
shall
find
most
of
them
to
be
organic
unities
of
exactly
the
same
nature
as
those
which
are
the
greatest
positive
goods
that
is
to
say
they
are
cognitions
of
some
object
accompanied
by
some
emotion
just
as
neither
a
cognition
nor
an
emotion
appeared
capable
of
being
greatly
good
so
with
one
exception
neither
a
cognition
nor
an
emotion
appears
capable
of
being
greatly
evil
and
just
as
a
whole
formed
of
both
even
without
the
addition
of
any
other
element
appeared
undoubtedly
capable
of
being
a
great
good
so
such
a
whole
appears
capable
of
being
a
great
evil
with
regard
to
the
element
which
was
discussed
as
capable
of
adding
greatly
to
the
value
of
a
good
namely
it
will
appear
that
it
has
different
relations
towards
different
kinds
of
evils
in
some
cases
the
addition
of
true
belief
to
a
positive
evil
seems
to
constitute
a
far
worse
evil
but
in
other
cases
it
is
not
apparent
that
it
makes
any
difference
the
greatest
positive
evils
may
be
divided
into
the
following
three
classes
the
first
class
consists
of
those
evils
which
seem
always
to
include
an
enjoyment
or
admiring
contemplation
of
things
which
are
themselves
either
evil
or
ugly
that
is
to
say
these
evils
are
characterised
by
the
fact
that
they
include
precisely
the
same
emotion
which
is
also
essential
to
the
greatest
unmixed
goods
from
which
they
are
differentiated
by
the
fact
that
this
emotion
is
directed
towards
an
inappropriate
object
in
so
far
as
this
emotion
is
either
a
slight
good
in
itself
or
a
slightly
beautiful
object
these
evils
would
therefore
be
cases
of
what
i
have
called
mixed
evils
but
as
i
have
already
said
it
seems
very
doubtful
whether
an
emotion
completely
isolated
from
its
object
has
either
value
or
beauty
it
certainly
has
not
much
of
either
it
is
however
important
to
observe
that
the
very
same
emotions
which
are
often
loosely
talked
of
as
the
greatest
or
the
only
goods
may
be
essential
constituents
of
the
very
worst
wholes
that
according
to
the
nature
of
the
cognition
which
accompanies
them
they
may
be
conditions
either
of
the
greatest
good
or
of
the
greatest
evil
in
order
to
illustrate
the
nature
of
evils
of
this
class
i
may
take
two
instances
cruelty
and
lasciviousness
that
these
are
great
intrinsic
evils
we
may
i
think
easily
assure
ourselves
by
imagining
the
state
of
a
man
whose
mind
is
solely
occupied
by
either
of
these
passions
in
their
worst
form
if
we
then
consider
what
judgment
we
should
pass
upon
a
universe
which
consisted
of
minds
thus
occupied
without
the
smallest
hope
that
there
would
ever
exist
in
it
the
smallest
consciousness
of
any
object
other
than
those
proper
to
these
passions
or
any
feeling
directed
to
any
such
object
i
think
we
can
not
avoid
the
conclusion
that
the
existence
of
such
a
universe
would
be
a
far
worse
evil
than
the
existence
of
none
at
all
but
if
this
be
so
it
follows
that
these
two
vicious
states
are
not
only
as
is
commonly
admitted
bad
as
means
but
also
bad
in
and
that
they
involve
in
their
nature
that
complication
of
elements
which
i
have
called
a
love
of
what
is
evil
or
ugly
is
i
think
no
less
plain
with
regard
to
the
pleasures
of
lust
the
nature
of
the
cognition
by
the
presence
of
which
they
are
to
be
defined
is
somewhat
difficult
to
analyse
but
it
appears
to
include
both
cognitions
of
organic
sensations
and
perceptions
of
states
of
the
body
of
which
the
enjoyment
is
certainly
an
evil
in
itself
so
far
as
these
are
concerned
lasciviousness
would
then
include
in
its
essence
an
admiring
contemplation
of
what
is
ugly
but
certainly
one
of
its
commonest
ingredients
in
its
worst
forms
is
an
enjoyment
of
the
same
state
of
mind
in
other
people
and
in
this
case
it
would
therefore
also
include
a
love
of
what
is
evil
with
regard
to
cruelty
it
is
easy
to
see
that
an
enjoyment
of
pain
in
other
people
is
essential
to
it
and
as
we
shall
see
when
we
come
to
consider
pain
this
is
certainly
a
love
of
evil
while
in
so
far
as
it
also
includes
a
delight
in
the
bodily
signs
of
agony
it
would
also
comprehend
a
love
of
what
is
ugly
in
both
cases
it
should
be
observed
the
evil
of
the
state
is
heightened
not
only
by
an
increase
in
the
evil
or
ugliness
of
the
object
but
also
by
an
increase
in
the
enjoyment
it
might
be
objected
in
the
case
of
cruelty
that
our
disapproval
of
it
even
in
the
isolated
case
supposed
where
no
considerations
of
its
badness
as
a
means
could
influence
us
may
yet
be
really
directed
to
the
pain
of
the
persons
which
it
takes
delight
in
contemplating
this
objection
may
be
met
in
the
first
place
by
the
remark
that
it
entirely
fails
to
explain
the
judgment
which
yet
i
think
no
one
on
reflection
will
be
able
to
avoid
making
that
even
though
the
amount
of
pain
contemplated
be
the
same
yet
the
greater
the
delight
in
its
contemplation
the
worse
the
state
of
things
but
it
may
also
i
think
be
met
by
notice
of
a
fact
which
we
were
unable
to
urge
in
considering
the
similar
possibility
with
regard
to
goods
namely
the
possibility
that
the
reason
why
we
attribute
greater
value
to
a
worthy
affection
for
a
person
is
that
we
take
into
account
the
additional
good
consisting
in
the
existence
of
that
person
we
may
i
think
urge
in
the
case
of
cruelty
that
its
intrinsic
odiousness
is
equally
great
whether
the
pain
contemplated
really
exists
or
is
purely
imaginary
i
at
least
am
unable
to
distinguish
that
in
this
case
the
presence
of
makes
any
difference
to
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
whole
considered
although
it
undoubtedly
may
make
a
great
difference
to
its
value
a
and
so
also
with
regard
to
other
evils
of
this
class
i
am
unable
to
see
that
a
true
belief
in
the
of
their
objects
makes
any
difference
in
the
degree
of
their
positive
demerits
on
the
other
hand
the
presence
of
another
class
of
beliefs
seems
to
make
a
considerable
difference
when
we
enjoy
what
is
evil
or
ugly
in
spite
of
our
knowledge
that
it
is
so
the
state
of
things
seems
considerably
worse
than
if
we
made
no
judgment
at
all
as
to
the
object
s
value
and
the
same
seems
also
strangely
enough
to
be
the
case
when
we
make
a
false
judgment
of
value
when
we
admire
what
is
ugly
or
evil
believing
that
it
is
beautiful
and
good
this
belief
seems
also
to
enhance
the
intrinsic
vileness
of
our
condition
it
must
of
course
be
understood
that
in
both
these
cases
the
judgment
in
question
is
merely
what
i
have
called
a
judgment
of
taste
that
is
to
say
it
is
concerned
with
the
worth
of
the
qualities
actually
cognised
and
not
with
the
worth
of
the
object
to
which
those
qualities
may
be
rightly
or
wrongly
attributed
finally
it
should
be
mentioned
that
evils
of
this
class
that
emotional
element
namely
enjoyment
and
admiration
which
they
share
with
great
unmixed
goods
appear
always
also
to
include
some
specific
emotion
which
does
not
enter
in
the
same
way
into
the
constitution
of
any
good
the
presence
of
this
specific
emotion
seems
certainly
to
enhance
the
badness
of
the
whole
though
it
is
not
plain
that
by
itself
it
would
be
either
evil
or
ugly
the
second
class
of
great
evils
are
undoubtedly
mixed
evils
but
i
treat
them
next
because
in
a
certain
respect
they
appear
to
be
the
of
the
class
last
considered
just
as
it
is
essential
to
this
last
class
that
they
should
include
an
emotion
appropriate
to
the
cognition
of
what
is
good
or
beautiful
but
directed
to
an
inappropriate
object
so
to
this
second
class
it
is
essential
that
they
should
include
a
cognition
of
what
is
good
or
beautiful
but
accompanied
by
an
inappropriate
emotion
in
short
just
as
the
last
class
may
be
described
as
cases
of
the
love
of
what
is
evil
or
ugly
so
this
class
may
be
described
as
cases
of
the
hatred
of
what
is
good
or
beautiful
with
regard
to
these
evils
it
should
be
remarked
first
that
the
vices
of
hatred
envy
and
contempt
where
these
vices
are
evil
in
themselves
appear
to
be
instances
of
them
and
that
they
are
frequently
accompanied
by
evils
of
the
first
class
for
example
where
a
delight
is
felt
in
the
pain
of
a
good
person
where
they
are
thus
accompanied
the
whole
thus
formed
is
undoubtedly
worse
than
if
either
existed
singly
and
secondly
that
in
their
case
a
true
belief
in
the
existence
of
the
good
or
beautiful
object
which
is
hated
does
appear
to
enhance
the
badness
of
the
whole
in
which
it
is
present
undoubtedly
also
as
in
our
first
class
the
presence
of
a
true
belief
as
to
the
of
the
objects
contemplated
increases
the
evil
but
contrary
to
what
was
the
case
in
our
first
class
a
judgment
of
value
appears
to
lessen
it
the
third
class
of
great
positive
evils
appears
to
be
the
class
of
with
regard
to
these
it
should
first
be
remarked
that
as
in
the
case
of
pleasure
it
is
not
pain
itself
but
only
the
consciousness
of
pain
towards
which
our
judgments
of
value
are
directed
just
as
in
chap
it
was
said
that
pleasure
however
intense
which
no
one
felt
would
be
no
good
at
all
so
it
appears
that
pain
however
intense
of
which
there
was
no
consciousness
would
be
no
evil
at
all
it
is
therefore
only
the
consciousness
of
intense
pain
which
can
be
maintained
to
be
a
great
evil
but
that
this
may
be
a
great
evil
i
can
not
avoid
thinking
the
case
of
pain
thus
seems
to
differ
from
that
of
pleasure
for
the
mere
consciousness
of
pleasure
however
intense
does
not
appear
to
be
a
good
even
if
it
has
some
slight
intrinsic
value
in
short
pain
if
we
understand
by
this
expression
the
consciousness
of
pain
appears
to
be
a
far
worse
evil
than
pleasure
is
a
good
but
if
this
be
so
then
must
be
admitted
to
be
an
exception
from
the
rule
which
seems
to
hold
both
of
all
great
evils
and
of
great
goods
namely
that
they
are
all
organic
unities
to
which
a
cognition
of
an
object
an
emotion
directed
towards
that
object
are
essential
in
the
case
of
pain
and
of
pain
alone
it
seems
to
be
true
that
a
mere
cognition
by
itself
may
be
a
great
evil
it
is
indeed
organic
unity
since
it
involves
both
the
cognition
and
the
object
neither
of
which
by
themselves
has
either
merit
or
demerit
but
it
is
a
less
complex
organic
unity
than
any
other
great
evil
and
than
any
great
good
in
respect
of
the
fact
that
it
does
not
involve
the
cognition
an
emotion
directed
towards
its
object
in
respect
of
the
fact
that
the
may
here
be
absolutely
simple
whereas
in
most
if
not
all
other
cases
the
object
itself
is
highly
complex
this
want
of
analogy
between
the
relation
of
pain
to
intrinsic
evil
and
of
pleasure
to
intrinsic
good
seems
also
to
be
exhibited
in
a
second
respect
not
only
is
it
the
case
that
consciousness
of
intense
pain
is
by
itself
a
great
evil
whereas
consciousness
of
intense
pleasure
is
by
itself
no
great
good
but
also
the
difference
appears
to
hold
of
the
contribution
which
they
make
to
the
value
of
the
whole
when
they
are
combined
respectively
with
another
great
evil
or
with
a
great
good
that
is
to
say
the
presence
of
pleasure
though
not
in
proportion
to
its
intensity
does
appear
to
enhance
the
value
of
a
whole
in
which
it
is
combined
with
any
of
the
great
unmixed
goods
which
we
have
considered
it
might
even
be
maintained
that
it
is
wholes
in
which
pleasure
is
included
that
possess
any
great
value
it
is
certain
at
all
events
that
the
presence
of
pleasure
makes
a
contribution
to
the
value
of
good
wholes
greatly
in
excess
of
its
own
intrinsic
value
on
the
contrary
if
a
feeling
of
pain
be
combined
with
any
of
the
evil
states
of
mind
which
we
have
been
considering
the
difference
which
its
presence
makes
to
the
value
of
the
whole
a
seems
to
be
rather
for
the
better
than
the
worse
in
any
case
the
only
additional
evil
which
it
introduces
is
that
which
it
by
itself
intrinsically
constitutes
thus
whereas
pain
is
a
great
evil
but
makes
no
addition
to
the
badness
of
a
whole
in
which
it
is
combined
with
some
other
bad
thing
except
that
which
consists
in
its
own
intrinsic
badness
pleasure
conversely
is
not
a
great
good
but
does
make
a
great
addition
to
the
goodness
of
a
whole
in
which
it
is
combined
with
a
good
thing
quite
apart
from
its
own
intrinsic
value
but
finally
it
must
be
insisted
that
pleasure
and
pain
are
completely
analogous
in
this
that
we
can
not
assume
either
that
the
presence
of
pleasure
always
makes
a
state
of
things
better
the
or
that
the
presence
of
pain
always
makes
it
worse
this
is
the
truth
which
is
most
liable
to
be
overlooked
with
regard
to
them
and
it
is
because
this
is
true
that
the
common
theory
that
pleasure
is
the
only
good
and
pain
the
only
evil
has
its
grossest
consequences
in
misjudgments
of
value
not
only
is
the
pleasantness
of
a
state
in
proportion
to
its
intrinsic
worth
it
may
even
add
positively
to
its
vileness
we
do
not
think
the
successful
hatred
of
a
villain
the
less
vile
and
odious
because
he
takes
the
keenest
delight
in
it
nor
is
there
the
least
need
in
logic
why
we
should
think
so
apart
from
an
unintelligent
prejudice
in
favour
of
pleasure
in
fact
it
seems
to
be
the
case
that
wherever
pleasure
is
added
to
an
evil
state
of
either
of
our
first
two
classes
the
whole
thus
formed
is
worse
than
if
no
pleasure
had
been
there
and
similarly
with
regard
to
pain
if
pain
be
added
to
an
evil
state
of
either
of
our
first
two
classes
the
whole
thus
formed
is
better
a
than
if
no
pain
had
been
there
though
here
if
the
pain
be
too
intense
since
that
is
a
great
evil
the
state
may
not
be
better
the
it
is
in
this
way
that
the
theory
of
vindictive
punishment
may
be
vindicated
the
infliction
of
pain
on
a
person
whose
state
of
mind
is
bad
may
if
the
pain
be
not
too
intense
create
a
state
of
things
that
is
better
the
than
if
the
evil
state
of
mind
had
existed
unpunished
whether
such
a
state
of
things
can
ever
constitute
a
good
is
another
question
ii
the
consideration
of
this
other
question
belongs
properly
to
the
second
topic
which
was
reserved
above
for
discussion
namely
the
topic
of
mixed
goods
mixed
goods
were
defined
above
as
things
which
though
positively
good
nevertheless
contain
as
essential
elements
something
intrinsically
evil
or
ugly
and
there
certainly
seem
to
be
such
goods
but
for
the
proper
consideration
of
them
it
is
necessary
to
take
into
account
a
new
distinction
the
distinction
just
expressed
as
being
between
the
value
which
a
thing
possesses
a
and
that
which
it
possesses
the
when
mixed
goods
were
defined
as
things
positively
good
the
expression
was
ambiguous
it
was
meant
that
they
were
positively
good
the
but
it
must
now
be
observed
that
the
value
which
a
thing
possesses
the
may
be
said
to
be
equivalent
to
the
sum
of
the
value
which
it
possesses
a
the
intrinsic
values
which
may
belong
to
any
of
its
parts
in
fact
by
the
value
which
a
thing
possesses
as
a
whole
there
may
be
meant
two
quite
distinct
things
there
may
be
meant
either
that
value
which
arises
solely
the
of
two
or
more
things
or
else
the
total
value
formed
by
the
addition
to
of
any
intrinsic
values
which
may
belong
to
the
things
combined
the
meaning
of
the
distinction
may
perhaps
be
most
easily
seen
by
considering
the
supposed
case
of
vindictive
punishment
if
it
is
true
that
the
combined
existence
of
two
evils
may
yet
constitute
a
less
evil
than
would
be
constituted
by
the
existence
of
either
singly
it
is
plain
that
this
can
only
be
because
there
arises
from
the
combination
a
positive
good
which
is
greater
than
the
between
the
sum
of
the
two
evils
and
the
demerit
of
either
singly
this
positive
good
would
then
be
the
value
of
the
whole
a
in
sense
yet
if
this
value
be
not
so
great
a
good
as
the
sum
of
the
two
evils
is
an
evil
it
is
plain
that
the
value
of
the
whole
state
of
things
will
be
a
positive
evil
and
this
value
is
the
value
of
the
whole
a
in
sense
whatever
view
may
be
taken
with
regard
to
the
particular
case
of
vindictive
punishment
it
is
plain
that
we
have
here
distinct
with
regard
to
of
which
a
separate
question
may
be
asked
in
the
case
of
every
organic
unity
the
first
of
these
two
things
may
be
expressed
as
between
the
value
the
whole
and
the
sum
of
the
value
of
its
parts
and
it
is
plain
that
where
the
parts
have
little
or
no
intrinsic
value
as
in
our
first
class
of
goods
this
difference
will
be
nearly
or
absolutely
identical
with
the
value
of
the
whole
thing
the
distinction
therefore
only
becomes
important
in
the
case
of
wholes
of
which
one
or
more
parts
have
a
great
intrinsic
value
positive
or
negative
the
first
of
these
cases
that
of
a
whole
in
which
one
part
has
a
great
value
is
exemplified
in
our
and
classes
of
great
unmixed
goods
and
similarly
the
summum
bonum
is
a
whole
of
which
parts
have
a
great
value
such
cases
it
may
be
observed
are
also
very
frequent
and
very
important
objects
of
aesthetic
judgment
since
the
essential
distinction
between
the
classical
and
the
romantic
styles
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
former
aims
at
obtaining
the
greatest
possible
value
for
the
whole
a
in
sense
whereas
the
latter
sacrifices
this
in
order
to
obtain
the
greatest
possible
value
for
some
which
is
itself
an
organic
unity
it
follows
that
we
can
not
declare
either
style
to
be
necessarily
superior
since
an
equally
good
result
the
or
as
a
whole
in
sense
may
be
obtained
by
either
method
but
the
distinctively
temperament
seems
to
be
characterised
by
a
tendency
to
prefer
a
good
result
obtained
by
the
classical
to
an
equally
good
result
obtained
by
the
romantic
method
but
what
we
have
now
to
consider
are
cases
of
wholes
in
which
one
or
more
parts
have
a
great
value
are
great
positive
evils
and
first
of
all
we
may
take
the
cases
like
that
of
retributive
punishment
in
which
we
have
a
whole
exclusively
composed
of
two
great
positive
evils
wickedness
and
pain
can
such
a
whole
ever
be
positively
good
the
i
can
see
no
reason
to
think
that
such
wholes
ever
are
positively
good
the
but
from
the
fact
that
they
may
nevertheless
be
less
evils
than
either
of
their
parts
taken
singly
it
follows
that
they
have
a
characteristic
which
is
most
important
for
the
correct
decision
of
practical
questions
it
follows
that
quite
apart
from
or
any
value
which
an
evil
may
have
as
a
mere
means
it
may
one
evil
already
exists
be
worth
while
to
create
another
since
by
the
mere
creation
of
this
second
there
may
be
constituted
a
whole
less
bad
than
if
the
original
evil
had
been
left
to
exist
by
itself
and
similarly
with
regard
to
all
the
wholes
which
i
am
about
to
consider
it
must
be
remembered
that
even
if
they
are
not
goods
the
yet
where
an
evil
already
exists
as
in
this
world
evils
do
exist
the
existence
of
the
other
part
of
these
wholes
will
constitute
a
thing
desirable
its
own
that
is
to
say
not
merely
a
means
to
future
goods
but
one
of
the
which
must
be
taken
into
account
in
estimating
what
that
best
possible
state
of
things
is
to
which
every
right
action
must
be
a
means
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
can
not
avoid
thinking
that
there
are
wholes
containing
something
positively
evil
and
ugly
which
are
nevertheless
great
positive
goods
on
the
whole
indeed
it
appears
to
be
to
this
class
that
those
instances
of
virtue
which
contain
anything
intrinsically
good
chiefly
belong
it
need
not
of
course
be
denied
that
there
is
sometimes
included
in
a
virtuous
disposition
more
or
less
of
those
unmixed
goods
which
were
first
discussed
that
is
to
say
a
real
love
of
what
is
good
or
beautiful
but
the
typical
and
characteristic
virtuous
dispositions
so
far
as
they
are
not
mere
means
seem
rather
to
be
examples
of
mixed
goods
we
may
take
as
instances
courage
and
compassion
which
seem
to
belong
to
the
second
of
the
three
classes
of
virtues
distinguished
in
our
last
chapter
and
the
specifically
moral
sentiment
by
reference
to
which
the
third
of
those
three
classes
was
defined
courage
and
compassion
in
so
far
as
they
contain
an
intrinsically
desirable
state
of
mind
seem
to
involve
essentially
a
cognition
of
something
evil
or
ugly
in
the
case
of
courage
the
object
of
the
cognition
may
be
an
evil
of
any
of
our
three
classes
in
the
case
of
compassion
the
proper
object
is
pain
both
these
virtues
accordingly
must
contain
precisely
the
same
cognitive
element
which
is
also
essential
to
evils
of
class
and
they
are
differentiated
from
these
by
the
fact
that
the
emotion
directed
to
these
objects
is
in
their
case
an
emotion
of
the
same
kind
which
was
essential
to
evils
of
class
in
short
just
as
evils
of
class
seemed
to
consist
in
a
hatred
of
what
was
good
or
beautiful
and
evils
of
class
in
a
love
of
what
was
evil
or
ugly
so
these
virtues
involve
a
of
what
is
evil
or
ugly
both
these
virtues
do
no
doubt
also
contain
other
elements
and
among
these
each
contains
its
specific
emotion
but
that
their
value
does
not
depend
solely
upon
these
other
elements
we
may
easily
assure
ourselves
by
considering
what
we
should
think
of
an
attitude
of
endurance
or
of
defiant
contempt
toward
an
object
intrinsically
good
or
beautiful
or
of
the
state
of
a
man
whose
mind
was
filled
with
pity
for
the
happiness
of
a
worthy
admiration
yet
pity
for
the
undeserved
sufferings
of
others
endurance
of
pain
to
ourselves
and
a
defiant
hatred
of
evil
dispositions
in
ourselves
or
in
others
seem
to
be
undoubtedly
admirable
in
themselves
and
if
so
there
are
admirable
things
which
must
be
lost
if
there
were
no
cognition
of
evil
similarly
the
specifically
moral
sentiment
in
all
cases
where
it
has
any
considerable
intrinsic
value
appears
to
include
a
hatred
of
evils
of
the
first
and
second
classes
it
is
true
that
the
emotion
is
here
excited
by
the
idea
that
an
action
is
right
or
wrong
and
hence
the
object
of
the
idea
which
excites
it
is
generally
not
an
intrinsic
evil
but
as
far
as
i
can
discover
the
emotion
with
which
a
conscientious
man
views
a
real
or
imaginary
right
action
contains
as
an
essential
element
the
same
emotion
with
which
he
views
a
wrong
one
it
seems
indeed
that
this
element
is
necessary
to
make
his
emotion
specifically
and
the
specifically
moral
emotion
excited
by
the
idea
of
a
wrong
action
seems
to
me
to
contain
essentially
a
more
or
less
vague
cognition
of
the
kind
of
intrinsic
evils
which
are
usually
caused
by
wrong
actions
whether
they
would
or
would
not
be
caused
by
the
particular
action
in
question
i
am
in
fact
unable
to
distinguish
in
its
main
features
the
moral
sentiment
excited
by
the
idea
of
rightness
and
wrongness
wherever
it
is
intense
from
the
total
state
constituted
by
a
cognition
of
something
intrinsically
evil
together
with
the
emotion
of
hatred
directed
towards
it
nor
need
we
be
surprised
that
this
mental
state
should
be
the
one
chiefly
associated
with
the
idea
of
rightness
if
we
reflect
on
the
nature
of
those
actions
which
are
most
commonly
recognised
as
duties
for
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
actions
of
which
we
commonly
think
as
duties
are
what
we
feel
to
be
our
duty
is
to
from
some
action
to
which
a
strong
natural
impulse
tempts
us
and
these
wrong
actions
in
the
avoidance
of
which
duty
consists
are
usually
such
as
produce
very
immediately
some
bad
consequence
in
pain
to
others
while
in
many
prominent
instances
the
inclination
which
prompts
us
to
them
is
itself
an
intrinsic
evil
containing
as
where
the
impulse
is
lust
or
cruelty
an
anticipatory
enjoyment
of
something
evil
or
ugly
that
right
action
does
thus
so
frequently
entail
the
suppression
of
some
evil
impulse
is
necessary
to
explain
the
plausibility
of
the
view
that
virtue
in
the
control
of
passion
by
reason
accordingly
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
whenever
a
strong
moral
emotion
is
excited
by
the
idea
of
rightness
this
emotion
is
accompanied
by
a
vague
cognition
of
the
kind
of
evils
usually
suppressed
or
avoided
by
the
actions
which
most
frequently
occur
to
us
as
instances
of
duty
and
that
the
emotion
is
directed
towards
this
evil
quality
we
may
then
conclude
that
the
specific
moral
emotion
owes
almost
all
its
intrinsic
value
to
the
fact
that
it
includes
a
cognition
of
evils
accompanied
by
a
hatred
of
them
mere
rightness
whether
truly
or
untruly
attributed
to
an
action
seems
incapable
of
forming
the
object
of
an
emotional
contemplation
which
shall
be
any
great
good
if
this
be
so
then
we
have
in
many
prominent
instances
of
virtue
cases
of
a
whole
greatly
good
in
itself
which
yet
contains
the
cognition
of
something
whereof
the
existence
would
be
a
great
evil
a
great
good
is
absolutely
dependent
for
its
value
upon
its
inclusion
of
something
evil
or
ugly
although
it
does
not
owe
its
value
to
this
element
in
it
and
in
the
case
of
virtues
this
evil
object
does
in
general
actually
exist
but
there
seems
no
reason
to
think
that
when
it
does
exist
the
whole
state
of
things
thus
constituted
is
therefore
the
better
the
what
seems
indubitable
is
only
that
the
feeling
contemplation
of
an
object
whose
existence
be
a
great
evil
or
which
is
ugly
may
be
essential
to
a
valuable
whole
we
have
another
undoubted
instance
of
this
in
the
appreciation
of
tragedy
but
in
tragedy
the
sufferings
of
lear
and
the
vice
of
iago
may
be
purely
imaginary
and
it
seems
certain
that
if
they
really
existed
the
evil
thus
existing
while
it
must
detract
from
the
good
consisting
in
a
proper
feeling
towards
them
will
add
no
positive
value
to
that
good
great
enough
to
counterbalance
such
a
loss
it
does
indeed
seem
that
the
existence
of
a
true
belief
in
the
object
of
these
mixed
goods
does
add
value
to
the
whole
in
which
it
is
combined
with
them
a
conscious
compassion
for
real
suffering
seems
to
be
better
a
than
a
compassion
for
sufferings
merely
imaginary
and
this
may
well
be
the
case
even
though
the
evil
involved
in
the
actual
suffering
makes
the
total
state
of
things
bad
the
and
it
certainly
seems
to
be
true
that
a
belief
in
the
actual
existence
of
its
object
makes
a
worse
mixed
good
than
if
our
state
of
mind
were
that
with
which
we
normally
regard
pure
fiction
accordingly
we
may
conclude
that
the
only
mixed
goods
which
are
positively
good
the
are
those
in
which
the
object
is
something
which
be
a
great
evil
if
it
existed
or
which
ugly
with
regard
then
to
those
mixed
goods
which
consist
in
an
appropriate
attitude
of
the
mind
towards
things
evil
or
ugly
and
which
include
among
their
number
the
greater
part
of
such
virtues
as
have
any
intrinsic
value
whatever
the
following
three
conclusions
seem
to
be
those
chiefly
requiring
to
be
emphasized
there
seems
no
reason
to
think
that
where
the
object
is
a
thing
evil
in
itself
which
the
total
state
of
things
is
ever
positively
on
the
the
appropriate
mental
attitude
towards
a
really
existing
evil
contains
of
course
an
element
which
is
absolutely
identical
with
the
same
attitude
towards
the
same
evil
where
it
is
purely
imaginary
and
this
element
which
is
common
to
the
two
cases
may
be
a
great
positive
good
on
the
whole
but
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
that
where
the
evil
is
the
amount
of
this
real
evil
is
always
sufficient
to
reduce
the
total
sum
of
value
to
a
negative
quantity
accordingly
we
have
no
reason
to
maintain
the
paradox
that
an
ideal
world
would
be
one
in
which
vice
and
suffering
must
exist
in
order
that
it
may
contain
the
goods
consisting
in
the
appropriate
emotion
towards
them
it
is
not
a
positive
good
that
suffering
should
exist
in
order
that
we
may
compassionate
it
or
wickedness
that
we
may
hate
it
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
any
actual
evil
whatsoever
would
be
contained
in
the
ideal
it
follows
that
we
can
not
admit
the
actual
validity
of
any
of
the
arguments
commonly
used
in
theodicies
no
such
argument
succeeds
in
justifying
the
fact
that
there
does
exist
even
the
smallest
of
the
many
evils
which
this
world
contains
the
most
that
can
be
said
for
such
arguments
is
that
when
they
make
appeal
to
the
principle
of
organic
unity
their
appeal
is
valid
it
be
the
case
that
the
existence
of
evil
was
necessary
not
merely
as
a
means
but
analytically
to
the
existence
of
the
greatest
good
but
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
this
the
case
in
any
instance
whatsoever
but
there
reason
to
think
that
the
cognition
of
things
evil
or
ugly
which
are
purely
imaginary
is
essential
to
the
ideal
in
this
case
the
burden
of
proof
lies
the
other
way
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
appreciation
of
tragedy
is
a
great
positive
good
and
it
seems
almost
equally
certain
that
the
virtues
of
compassion
courage
and
contain
such
goods
and
to
all
these
the
cognition
of
things
which
would
be
evil
if
they
existed
is
analytically
necessary
here
then
we
have
things
of
which
the
existence
must
add
value
to
any
whole
in
which
they
are
contained
nor
is
it
possible
to
assure
ourselves
that
any
whole
from
which
they
were
omitted
would
thereby
gain
more
in
its
value
a
than
it
would
lose
by
their
omission
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
any
whole
which
did
not
contain
them
would
be
so
good
the
as
some
whole
in
which
they
were
obtained
the
case
for
their
inclusion
in
the
ideal
is
as
strong
as
that
for
the
inclusion
of
material
qualities
above
the
inclusion
of
these
goods
nothing
can
be
urged
except
a
bare
possibility
finally
it
is
important
to
insist
that
as
was
said
above
these
mixed
virtues
have
a
great
practical
value
in
addition
to
that
which
they
possess
either
in
themselves
or
as
mere
means
where
evils
do
exist
as
in
this
world
they
do
the
fact
that
they
are
known
and
properly
appreciated
constitutes
a
state
of
things
having
greater
value
a
even
than
the
same
appreciation
of
purely
imaginary
evils
this
state
of
things
it
has
been
said
is
never
positively
good
the
but
where
the
evil
which
reduces
its
total
value
to
a
negative
quantity
already
unavoidably
exists
to
obtain
the
intrinsic
value
which
belongs
to
it
a
will
obviously
produce
a
better
state
of
things
than
if
the
evil
had
existed
by
itself
quite
apart
from
the
good
element
in
it
which
is
identical
with
the
appreciation
of
imaginary
evils
and
from
any
ulterior
consequences
which
its
existence
may
bring
about
the
case
is
here
the
same
as
with
retributive
punishment
where
an
evil
already
exists
it
is
well
that
it
should
be
pitied
or
hated
or
endured
according
to
its
nature
just
as
it
may
be
well
that
some
evils
should
be
punished
of
course
as
in
all
practical
cases
it
often
happens
that
the
attainment
of
this
good
is
incompatible
with
the
attainment
of
another
and
a
greater
one
but
it
is
important
to
insist
that
we
have
here
a
real
intrinsic
value
which
must
be
taken
into
account
in
calculating
that
greatest
possible
balance
of
intrinsic
value
which
it
is
always
our
duty
to
produce
i
have
now
completed
such
remarks
as
seemed
most
necessary
to
be
made
concerning
intrinsic
values
it
is
obvious
that
for
the
proper
answering
of
this
the
fundamental
question
of
ethics
there
remains
a
field
of
investigation
as
wide
and
as
difficult
as
was
assigned
to
practical
ethics
in
my
last
chapter
there
is
as
much
to
be
said
concerning
what
results
are
intrinsically
good
and
in
what
degrees
as
concerning
what
results
it
is
possible
for
us
to
bring
about
both
questions
demand
and
will
repay
an
equally
patient
enquiry
many
of
the
judgments
which
i
have
made
in
this
chapter
will
no
doubt
seem
unduly
arbitrary
it
must
be
confessed
that
some
of
the
attributions
of
intrinsic
value
which
have
seemed
to
me
to
be
true
do
not
display
that
symmetry
and
system
which
is
wont
to
be
required
of
philosophers
but
if
this
be
urged
as
an
objection
i
may
respectfully
point
out
that
it
is
none
we
have
no
title
whatever
to
assume
that
the
truth
on
any
will
display
such
symmetry
as
we
desire
to
see
or
to
use
the
common
vague
phrase
that
it
will
possess
any
particular
form
of
to
search
for
unity
and
system
at
the
expense
of
truth
is
not
i
take
it
the
proper
business
of
philosophy
however
universally
it
may
have
been
the
practice
of
philosophers
and
that
all
truths
about
the
universe
possess
to
one
another
all
the
various
relations
which
may
be
meant
by
unity
can
only
be
legitimately
asserted
when
we
have
carefully
distinguished
those
various
relations
and
discovered
what
those
truths
are
in
particular
we
can
have
no
title
to
assert
that
ethical
truths
are
unified
in
any
particular
manner
except
in
virtue
of
an
enquiry
conducted
by
the
method
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
follow
and
to
illustrate
the
study
of
ethics
would
no
doubt
be
far
more
simple
and
its
results
far
more
systematic
if
for
instance
pain
were
an
evil
of
exactly
the
same
magnitude
as
pleasure
is
a
good
but
we
have
no
reason
whatever
to
assume
that
the
universe
is
such
that
ethical
truths
must
display
this
kind
of
symmetry
no
argument
against
my
conclusion
that
pleasure
and
pain
do
thus
correspond
can
have
any
weight
whatever
failing
a
careful
examination
of
the
instances
which
have
led
me
to
form
it
nevertheless
i
am
content
that
the
results
of
this
chapter
should
be
taken
rather
as
illustrating
the
method
which
must
be
pursued
in
answering
the
fundamental
question
of
ethics
and
the
principles
which
must
be
observed
than
as
giving
the
correct
answer
to
that
question
that
things
intrinsically
good
or
bad
are
many
and
various
that
most
of
them
are
organic
unities
in
the
peculiar
and
definite
sense
to
which
i
have
confined
the
term
and
that
our
only
means
of
deciding
upon
their
intrinsic
value
and
its
degree
is
by
carefully
distinguishing
exactly
what
the
thing
is
about
which
we
ask
the
question
and
then
looking
to
see
whether
it
has
or
has
not
the
unique
predicate
good
in
any
of
its
various
degrees
these
are
the
conclusions
upon
the
truth
of
which
i
desire
to
insist
similarly
in
my
last
chapter
with
regard
to
the
question
what
ought
we
to
do
i
have
endeavoured
rather
to
shew
exactly
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
question
and
what
difficulties
must
consequently
be
faced
in
answering
it
than
to
prove
that
any
particular
answers
are
true
and
that
these
two
questions
having
precisely
the
nature
which
i
have
assigned
to
them
are
questions
which
it
is
the
object
of
ethics
to
answer
may
be
regarded
as
the
main
result
of
the
preceding
chapters
these
are
the
questions
which
ethical
philosophers
have
always
been
mainly
concerned
to
answer
although
they
have
not
recognised
what
their
question
was
what
predicate
they
were
asserting
to
attach
to
things
the
practice
of
asking
what
things
are
virtues
or
duties
without
distinguishing
what
these
terms
mean
the
practice
of
asking
what
ought
to
be
here
and
now
without
distinguishing
whether
as
means
or
end
for
its
own
sake
or
for
that
of
its
results
the
search
for
one
single
of
right
or
wrong
without
the
recognition
that
in
order
to
discover
a
criterion
we
must
first
know
what
things
right
or
wrong
and
the
neglect
of
the
principle
of
organic
unities
these
sources
of
error
have
hitherto
been
almost
universally
prevalent
in
ethics
the
conscious
endeavour
to
avoid
them
all
and
to
apply
to
all
the
ordinary
objects
of
ethical
judgment
these
two
questions
and
these
only
has
it
intrinsic
value
and
is
it
a
means
to
the
best
possible
this
attempt
so
far
as
i
know
is
entirely
new
and
its
results
when
compared
with
those
habitual
to
moral
philosophers
are
certainly
sufficiently
surprising
that
to
common
sense
they
will
not
appear
so
strange
i
venture
to
hope
and
believe
it
is
i
think
much
to
be
desired
that
the
labour
commonly
devoted
to
answering
such
questions
as
whether
certain
ends
are
more
or
less
comprehensive
or
more
or
less
consistent
with
one
another
questions
which
even
if
a
precise
meaning
were
given
to
them
are
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
proof
of
any
ethical
conclusion
should
be
diverted
to
the
separate
investigation
of
these
two
clear
problems
the
main
object
of
this
chapter
has
been
to
define
roughly
the
class
of
things
among
which
we
may
expect
to
find
either
great
intrinsic
goods
or
great
intrinsic
evils
and
particularly
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
vast
variety
of
such
things
and
that
the
simplest
of
them
are
with
one
exception
highly
complex
wholes
composed
of
parts
which
have
little
or
no
value
in
themselves
all
of
them
involve
consciousness
of
an
object
which
is
itself
usually
highly
complex
and
almost
all
involve
also
an
emotional
attitude
towards
this
object
but
though
they
thus
have
certain
characteristics
in
common
the
vast
variety
of
qualities
in
respect
of
which
they
differ
from
one
another
are
equally
essential
to
their
value
neither
the
generic
character
of
all
nor
the
specific
character
of
each
is
either
greatly
good
or
greatly
evil
by
itself
they
owe
their
value
or
demerit
in
each
case
to
the
presence
of
both
my
discussion
falls
into
three
main
divisions
dealing
respectively
with
unmixed
goods
with
evils
and
with
mixed
goods
unmixed
goods
may
all
be
said
to
consist
in
the
love
of
beautiful
things
or
of
good
persons
but
the
number
of
different
goods
of
this
kind
is
as
great
as
that
of
beautiful
objects
and
they
are
also
differentiated
from
one
another
by
the
different
emotions
appropriate
to
different
objects
these
goods
are
undoubtedly
good
even
where
the
things
or
persons
loved
are
imaginary
but
it
was
urged
that
where
the
thing
or
person
is
real
and
is
believed
to
be
so
these
two
facts
together
when
combined
with
the
mere
love
of
the
qualities
in
question
constitute
a
whole
which
is
greatly
better
than
that
mere
love
having
an
additional
value
quite
distinct
from
that
which
belongs
to
the
existence
of
the
object
where
that
object
is
a
good
person
finally
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
love
of
mental
qualities
by
themselves
does
not
seem
to
be
so
great
a
good
as
that
of
mental
and
material
qualities
together
and
that
in
any
case
an
immense
number
of
the
best
things
are
or
include
a
love
of
material
qualities
great
evils
may
be
said
to
consist
either
in
the
love
of
what
is
evil
or
ugly
or
in
the
hatred
of
what
is
good
or
beautiful
or
in
the
consciousness
of
pain
thus
the
consciousness
of
pain
if
it
be
a
great
evil
is
the
only
exception
to
the
rule
that
all
great
goods
and
great
evils
involve
both
a
cognition
and
an
emotion
directed
towards
its
object
mixed
goods
are
those
which
include
some
element
which
is
evil
or
ugly
they
may
be
said
to
consist
either
in
hatred
of
what
is
ugly
or
of
evils
of
classes
and
or
in
compassion
for
pain
but
where
they
include
an
evil
which
actually
exists
its
demerit
seems
to
be
always
great
enough
to
