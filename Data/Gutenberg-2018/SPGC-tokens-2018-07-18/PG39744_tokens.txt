preface
arne
was
written
in
one
year
later
than
synnöve
solbakken
and
is
thought
by
many
to
be
björnson
best
story
though
it
is
in
my
opinion
surpassed
in
simplicity
of
style
and
delicate
analysis
of
motives
feelings
and
character
by
a
happy
boy
his
third
long
story
the
translation
of
which
is
now
in
progress
and
which
will
follow
this
volume
norway
most
eminent
composers
have
written
music
for
many
of
björnson
poems
and
made
them
favorite
songs
not
only
with
the
cultivated
classes
but
also
with
the
common
people
to
the
songs
in
arne
melodies
were
composed
by
björnson
brilliant
cousin
rikard
nordraak
who
died
in
only
years
old
but
who
had
already
won
a
place
as
one
of
norway
greatest
composers
with
a
view
of
popularizing
these
melodies
in
this
country
all
the
poems
have
been
given
in
precisely
the
same
metre
and
rhyme
as
the
original
and
those
caring
to
know
how
the
tunes
are
supposed
to
have
sounded
on
the
lips
of
arne
are
referred
to
the
norway
music
album
edited
by
auber
forestier
and
myself
and
published
by
oliver
ditson
of
boston
in
it
will
be
found
together
with
the
original
and

the
following
five
songs
from

oh
my
pet

it
was
such
a
pleasant
sunny

how
i
wonder
what

long
from
chapter
xiv
björnson
returned
to
norway
in
may
he
was
welcomed
with
enthusiasm
and
on
the
of
the
same
month
norway
natal
day
he
delivered
the
oration
at
the
dedication
of
the
wergeland
monument
to
a
gathering
of
more
than
ten
thousand
people
his
visit
to
america
was
a
brilliant
success
his
addresses
to
his
countrymen
in
america
were
chiefly
on
the
constitutional
struggle
of
norway
on
which
subject
an
article
by
him
will
be
found
in
the
february
issue
of
monthly
as
a
souvenir
of
his
pleasant
sojourn
among
us
i
will
here
attempt
an
english
translation
of
the
poem
olaf
trygvason
with
which
he
usually
greeted
his
hearers
at
his
lectures
it
is
one
of
his
most
popular
songs
spreading

the
north

when

the
reader
will
not
fail
to
be
reminded
by
this
song
by
björnson
of
longfellow
saga
of
king
olaf
the
musician
tale
in
his
tales
of
a
wayside
inn
and
especially
of
those
beautiful
poems
in
this
collection
the
building
of
the
long
serpent
and
the
crew
of
the
long
serpent
hoping
the
translation
of
these
stories
and
songs
will
enable
the
reader
to
appreciate
in
some
degree
the
secret
of
björnson
great
popularity
in
the
fair
land
that
lies

chapter
i
there
was
a
deep
gorge
between
two
mountains
through
this
gorge
a
large
full
stream
flowed
heavily
over
a
rough
and
stony
bottom
both
sides
were
high
and
steep
and
so
one
side
was
bare
but
close
to
its
foot
and
so
near
the
stream
that
the
latter
sprinkled
it
with
moisture
every
spring
and
autumn
stood
a
group
of
trees
gazing
upward
and
onward
yet
unable
to
advance
this
way
or
that
what
if
we
should
clothe
the
mountain
said
the
juniper
one
day
to
the
foreign
oak
to
which
it
stood
nearer
than
all
the
others
the
oak
looked
down
to
find
out
who
it
was
that
spoke
and
then
it
looked
up
again
without
deigning
a
reply
the
river
rushed
along
so
violently
that
it
worked
itself
into
a
white
foam
the
north
wind
had
forced
its
way
through
the
gorge
and
shrieked
in
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
the
naked
mountain
with
its
great
weight
hung
heavily
over
and
felt
cold
what
if
we
should
clothe
the
mountain
said
the
juniper
to
the
fir
on
the
other
side
if
anybody
is
to
do
it
i
suppose
it
must
be
we
said
the
fir
taking
hold
of
its
beard
and
glancing
toward
the
birch
what
do
you
think
but
the
birch
peered
cautiously
up
at
the
mountain
which
hung
over
it
so
threateningly
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
could
scarcely
breathe
let
us
clothe
it
in
god
name
said
the
birch
and
so
though
there
were
but
these
three
they
undertook
to
clothe
the
mountain
the
juniper
went
first
when
they
had
gone
a
little
way
they
met
the
heather
the
juniper
seemed
as
though
about
to
go
past
it
nay
take
the
heather
along
said
the
fir
and
the
heather
joined
them
soon
it
began
to
glide
on
before
the
juniper
catch
hold
of
me
said
the
heather
the
juniper
did
so
and
where
there
was
only
a
wee
crevice
the
heather
thrust
in
a
finger
and
where
it
first
had
placed
a
finger
the
juniper
took
hold
with
its
whole
hand
they
crawled
and
crept
along
the
fir
laboring
on
behind
the
birch
also
this
is
well
worth
doing
said
the
birch
but
the
mountain
began
to
ponder
on
what
manner
of
insignificant
objects
these
might
be
that
were
clambering
up
over
it
and
after
it
had
been
considering
the
matter
a
few
hundred
years
it
sent
a
little
brook
down
to
inquire
it
was
yet
in
the
time
of
the
spring
freshets
and
the
brook
stole
on
until
it
reached
the
heather
dear
dear
heather
can
not
you
let
me
pass
i
am
so
small
the
heather
was
very
busy
only
raised
itself
a
little
and
pressed
onward
in
under
and
onward
went
the
brook
dear
dear
juniper
can
not
you
let
me
pass
i
am
so
small
the
juniper
looked
sharply
at
it
but
if
the
heather
had
let
it
pass
why
in
all
reason
it
must
do
so
too
under
it
and
onward
went
the
brook
and
now
came
to
the
spot
where
the
fir
stood
puffing
on
the
dear
dear
fir
can
not
you
let
me
pass
i
am
really
so
small
said
the
brook
and
it
kissed
the
fir
foot
and
made
itself
so
very
sweet
the
fir
became
bashful
at
this
and
let
it
pass
but
the
birch
raised
itself
before
the
brook
asked
it
hi
hi
hi
said
the
brook
and
grew
ha
ha
ha
said
the
brook
and
grew
ho
ho
ho
said
the
brook
and
flung
the
heather
and
the
juniper
and
the
fir
and
the
birch
flat
on
their
faces
and
backs
up
and
down
these
great
hills
the
mountain
sat
for
many
hundred
years
musing
on
whether
it
had
not
smiled
a
little
that
day
it
was
plain
enough
the
mountain
did
not
want
to
be
clad
the
heather
fretted
over
this
until
it
grew
green
again
and
then
it
started
forward
fresh
courage
said
the
heather
the
juniper
had
half
raised
itself
to
look
at
the
heather
and
continued
to
keep
this
position
until
at
length
it
stood
upright
it
scratched
its
head
and
set
forth
again
taking
such
a
vigorous
foothold
that
it
seemed
as
though
the
mountain
must
feel
it
if
you
will
not
have
me
then
i
will
have
you
the
fir
crooked
its
toes
a
little
to
find
out
whether
they
were
whole
then
lifted
one
foot
found
it
whole
then
the
other
which
proved
also
to
be
whole
then
both
of
them
it
first
investigated
the
ground
it
had
been
over
next
where
it
had
been
lying
and
finally
where
it
should
go
after
this
it
began
to
wend
its
way
slowly
along
and
acted
just
as
though
it
had
never
fallen
the
birch
had
become
most
wretchedly
soiled
but
now
rose
up
and
made
itself
tidy
then
they
sped
onward
faster
and
faster
upward
and
on
either
side
in
sunshine
and
in
rain
what
in
the
world
can
this
be
said
the
mountain
all
glittering
with
dew
as
the
summer
sun
shone
down
on
it
the
birds
sang
the
piped
the
hare
hopped
along
and
the
ermine
hid
itself
and
screamed
then
the
day
came
when
the
heather
could
peep
with
one
eye
over
the
edge
of
the
mountain
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
the
heather
and
away
it
went
dear
me
what
is
it
the
heather
sees
said
the
juniper
and
moved
on
until
it
could
peer
up
oh
dear
oh
dear
it
shrieked
and
was
gone
what
is
the
matter
with
the
juniper
said
the
fir
and
took
long
strides
onward
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
soon
it
could
raise
itself
on
its
toes
and
peep
up
oh
dear
branches
and
needles
stood
on
end
in
wonderment
it
worked
its
way
forward
came
up
and
was
gone
what
is
it
all
the
others
see
and
not
i
said
the
birch
and
lifting
well
its
skirts
it
tripped
after
it
stretched
its
whole
head
up
at
once
oh
oh
is
not
here
a
great
forest
of
fir
and
heather
of
juniper
and
birch
standing
upon
the
waiting
for
us
said
the
birch
and
its
leaves
quivered
in
the
sunshine
so
that
the
dew
trembled
aye
this
is
what
it
is
to
reach
the
goal
said
the
juniper
chapter
ii
up
on
the
it
was
that
arne
was
born
his
mother
name
was
margit
and
she
was
the
only
child
at
the
houseman
place
kampen
once
in
her
eighteenth
year
she
stayed
too
long
at
a
dance
her
companions
had
left
her
and
so
margit
thought
that
the
way
home
would
be
just
as
long
whether
she
waited
until
the
dancing
was
over
or
not
and
thus
it
happened
that
she
kept
her
seat
until
the
fiddler
known
as
nils
the
tailor
suddenly
laid
aside
his
fiddle
as
was
his
wont
when
drink
took
possession
of
him
let
others
troll
the
tune
seized
the
prettiest
girl
moved
his
foot
as
evenly
as
the
rhythm
of
a
song
and
with
his
took
the
hat
from
the
head
of
the
tallest
person
present
ho
said
he
when
margit
went
home
that
evening
the
played
on
the
snow
with
most
wondrous
beauty
after
she
had
reached
her
she
was
moved
to
look
out
once
more
she
took
off
her
boddice
but
remained
standing
with
it
in
her
hand
then
she
felt
that
she
was
cold
closed
the
door
hastily
undressed
and
nestled
in
under
the
robe
that
night
margit
dreamed
about
a
great
red
cow
that
had
wandered
into
the
field
she
went
to
drive
it
out
but
though
she
tried
hard
she
could
not
stir
from
the
spot
the
cow
stood
calmly
grazing
there
until
it
grew
plump
and
well
fed
and
every
now
and
then
it
looked
at
her
with
large
heavy
eyes
the
next
time
there
was
a
dance
in
the
parish
margit
was
present
she
cared
little
for
dancing
that
evening
she
kept
her
seat
to
listen
to
the
music
and
it
seemed
strange
to
her
that
there
were
not
others
also
who
preferred
this
but
when
the
evening
had
worn
on
the
fiddler
arose
and
wanted
to
dance
all
at
once
he
went
directly
to
margit
kampen
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
was
about
but
she
danced
with
nils
the
tailor
soon
the
weather
grew
warm
and
there
was
no
more
dancing
that
spring
margit
took
such
interest
in
a
little
lamb
that
had
fallen
ill
that
her
mother
almost
thought
she
was
overdoing
it
it
is
only
a
little
lamb
said
the
mother
yes
but
it
is
ill
replied
margit
it
was
some
time
since
she
had
been
to
church
she
wished
to
have
her
mother
go
she
said
and
some
one
must
be
at
home
one
sunday
later
in
the
summer
the
weather
was
so
fine
that
the
hay
could
well
be
left
out
for
hours
and
the
mother
said
that
now
they
surely
might
both
go
margit
could
not
reasonably
object
to
this
and
got
ready
for
church
but
when
they
were
so
far
on
their
way
that
they
could
hear
the
she
burst
into
tears
the
mother
grew
deathly
pale
but
they
went
on
the
mother
in
advance
margit
following
listened
to
the
sermon
joined
in
all
the
hymns
to
the
very
last
followed
the
prayer
and
heard
the
bell
ring
before
they
left
but
when
they
were
seated
in
the
at
home
again
the
mother
took
margit
face
between
her
hands
and
said
hide
nothing
from
me
my
child
there
came
another
winter
when
margit
did
not
dance
but
nils
the
tailor
fiddled
took
more
strong
drink
than
ever
and
always
toward
the
close
of
the
evening
swung
the
prettiest
girl
at
the
party
in
those
days
it
was
told
as
a
certain
fact
that
he
could
marry
whom
he
pleased
among
the
daughters
of
the
first
in
the
parish
some
added
that
eli
böen
herself
had
courted
him
for
her
daughter
birgit
who
was
madly
in
love
with
him
but
just
at
that
time
an
infant
of
the
houseman
daughter
at
kampen
was
brought
to
baptism
it
was
christened
arne
and
tailor
nils
was
spoken
of
as
its
father
the
evening
of
the
same
day
nils
was
at
a
large
wedding
there
he
got
drunk
he
would
not
play
but
danced
all
the
time
and
scarcely
brooked
having
others
on
the
floor
but
when
he
crossed
to
birgit
böen
and
asked
her
to
dance
she
declined
he
gave
a
short
laugh
turned
on
his
heel
and
caught
hold
of
the
first
girl
he
encountered
she
resisted
he
looked
down
it
was
a
little
dark
maiden
who
had
been
sitting
gazing
fixedly
at
him
and
who
was
now
pale
bowing
lightly
over
her
he
whispered
will
you
not
dance
with
karen
she
made
no
reply
he
asked
once
more
then
she
answered
in
a
whisper
as
he
had
asked
dance
might
go
farther
than
i
wished
he
drew
slowly
back
but
once
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
made
a
spring
and
danced
the
halling
alone
no
one
else
was
dancing
the
others
stood
looking
on
in
silence
afterwards
he
went
out
in
the
barn
and
there
he
lay
down
and
wept
margit
kept
at
home
with
the
little
boy
she
heard
about
nils
how
he
went
from
dance
to
dance
and
she
looked
at
the
child
and
wept
looked
at
him
again
and
was
happy
the
first
thing
she
taught
him
was
to
say
papa
but
this
she
dared
not
do
when
the
mother
or
the
grandmother
as
she
was
henceforth
called
chanced
to
be
near
the
result
of
this
was
that
it
was
the
grandmother
whom
the
boy
called
papa
it
cost
margit
much
to
break
him
of
this
and
thus
she
fostered
in
him
an
early
shrewdness
he
was
not
very
large
before
he
knew
that
nils
the
tailor
was
his
father
and
when
he
reached
the
age
in
which
the
romantic
acquires
a
flavor
he
became
also
aware
what
sort
of
a
man
tailor
nils
was
the
grandmother
had
strictly
forbidden
even
the
mention
of
his
name
what
she
mainly
strove
for
was
to
have
the
houseman
place
kampen
become
an
independent
gard
so
that
her
daughter
and
her
boy
might
be
free
from
care
she
availed
herself
of
the
poverty
effected
the
purchase
of
the
place
paid
off
a
portion
of
the
money
each
year
and
managed
the
business
like
a
man
for
she
had
been
a
widow
for
fourteen
years
kampen
was
a
large
place
and
had
been
extended
until
now
it
fed
four
cows
sixteen
sheep
and
a
horse
in
which
she
was
half
owner
nils
the
tailor
meanwhile
took
to
roving
about
the
parish
his
business
had
fallen
off
partly
because
he
felt
less
interest
in
it
partly
also
because
he
was
not
liked
as
before
he
gave
therefore
more
time
to
fiddling
this
led
oftener
to
drinking
and
thence
to
fighting
and
evil
days
there
were
those
who
had
heard
him
say
he
was
unhappy
arne
might
have
been
about
six
years
old
when
one
winter
day
he
was
frolicking
in
the
bed
whose
coverlet
he
had
up
for
a
sail
while
he
was
steering
with
a
ladle
the
grandmother
sat
spinning
in
the
room
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
and
nodded
occasionally
as
though
she
would
make
a
fixed
fact
of
something
she
was
thinking
about
the
boy
knew
that
he
was
unheeded
and
he
fell
to
singing
just
as
he
had
learned
it
the
rough
wild
song
about
tailor
nils
unless
was
only
yesterday
hither
first
you
came
you
surely
heard
already
of
nils
the
tailor
fame
unless
was
but
this
morning
you
came
among
us
first
you
heard
how
he
knocked
over
tall
johan
knutson
kirst
how
in
his
famous
with
ola
he
said
down
your
porridge
when
we
two
fight
again
that
fighting
fellow
bugge
a
famous
man
was
he
his
name
was
known
all
over
fjord
and
fell
and
sea
choose
the
place
you
tailor
where
i
shall
knock
you
down
and
then
i
spit
upon
it
and
there
i
lay
your
crown
only
come
so
near
i
may
catch
your
scent
my
man
your
bragging
hurts
nobody
do
dream
it
ever
can
the
first
round
was
a
poor
one
and
neither
man
could
beat
but
both
kept
in
their
places
and
steady
on
their
feet
the
second
round
poor
bugge
was
beaten
black
and
blue
bugge
are
you
tired
it
going
hard
with
you
the
third
round
bugge
tumbled
and
bleeding
there
he
lay
bugge
where
your
bragging
luck
to
me
more
the
boy
did
not
sing
but
there
were
two
other
stanzas
which
his
mother
was
not
likely
to
have
taught
him
have
you
seen
a
tree
cast
its
shadow
on
yesterday
snow
have
you
seen
how
nils
does
his
smiles
on
the
girls
bestow
have
you
looked
at
nils
when
to
dance
he
just
commences
come
my
girl
you
must
go
it
is
too
late
when
you
lost
your
senses
these
two
stanzas
the
grandmother
knew
and
they
came
all
the
more
distinctly
into
her
mind
because
they
were
not
sung
she
said
nothing
to
the
boy
but
to
the
mother
she
said
teach
the
boy
well
about
your
own
shame
do
not
forget
the
last
verses
nils
the
tailor
was
so
broken
down
by
drink
that
he
was
no
longer
the
man
he
had
been
and
some
people
thought
his
end
could
not
be
far
distant
it
so
happened
that
two
american
gentlemen
were
visiting
in
the
parish
and
having
heard
that
a
wedding
was
going
on
in
the
vicinity
wanted
to
attend
it
that
they
might
learn
the
customs
of
the
country
nils
was
playing
there
they
gave
each
a
dollar
to
the
fiddler
and
asked
for
a
halling
but
no
one
would
come
forward
to
dance
it
however
much
it
was
urged
several
begged
nils
himself
to
dance
he
was
best
after
all
they
said
he
refused
but
the
request
became
still
more
urgent
and
finally
unanimous
this
was
what
he
wanted
he
gave
his
fiddle
to
another
player
took
off
his
jacket
and
cap
and
stepped
smiling
into
the
middle
of
the
room
he
was
followed
by
the
same
eager
attention
as
of
old
and
this
gave
him
his
old
strength
the
people
crowded
closely
together
those
who
were
farthest
back
climbing
upon
tables
and
benches
some
of
the
girls
were
perched
up
higher
than
all
the
rest
and
foremost
among
these
a
tall
girl
with
sunny
brown
hair
of
a
varying
tint
with
blue
eyes
deeply
set
beneath
a
strong
forehead
a
large
mouth
that
often
smiled
drawing
a
little
to
one
side
as
it
did
so
was
birgit
böen
nils
saw
her
as
he
glanced
up
at
the
beam
the
music
struck
up
a
deep
silence
followed
and
he
began
he
dashed
forward
along
the
floor
his
body
inclining
to
one
side
half
aslant
keeping
time
to
the
fiddle
crouching
down
he
balanced
himself
now
on
one
foot
now
on
the
other
flung
his
legs
crosswise
under
him
sprang
up
again
stood
as
though
about
to
make
a
fling
and
then
moved
on
aslant
as
before
the
fiddle
was
handled
by
skillful
fingers
and
more
and
more
fire
was
thrown
into
the
tune
nils
threw
his
head
farther
and
farther
back
and
suddenly
his
touched
the
beam
sending
the
dust
from
the
ceiling
in
showers
over
them
all
the
people
laughed
and
shouted
about
him
the
girls
stood
breathless
the
tune
hurrahed
with
the
rest
stimulating
him
anew
with
more
and
more
accents
nor
did
he
resist
the
exciting
influences
he
bent
forward
hopped
along
in
time
to
the
music
made
ready
apparently
for
a
fling
but
only
as
a
hoax
and
then
moved
on
his
body
aslant
as
before
and
when
he
seemed
the
least
prepared
for
it
his
thundered
against
the
beam
again
and
again
whereupon
he
turned
summersaults
forwards
and
backwards
in
the
air
landing
each
time
erect
on
his
feet
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
the
tune
running
through
some
wild
variations
worked
its
way
down
to
a
deep
tone
in
the
bass
where
it
quivered
and
vibrated
and
died
away
with
a
stroke
of
the
bow
the
crowd
dispersed
and
loud
eager
conversation
mingled
with
shouts
and
exclamations
broke
the
silence
nils
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
and
the
american
gentlemen
went
over
to
him
with
their
interpreter
and
each
gave
him
five
dollars
the
americans
talked
a
little
with
the
interpreter
whereupon
the
latter
asked
nils
if
he
would
go
with
them
as
their
servant
he
should
have
whatever
wages
he
wanted
whither
asked
nils
the
people
crowded
about
them
as
closely
as
possible
out
into
the
world
was
the
reply
when
asked
nils
and
looking
around
with
a
shining
face
he
caught
birgit
böen
eyes
and
did
not
let
them
go
again
in
a
week
when
we
come
back
here
was
the
answer
it
is
possible
i
will
be
ready
replied
nils
weighing
his
two
pieces
he
had
rested
one
arm
on
the
shoulder
of
a
man
standing
near
him
and
it
trembled
so
that
the
man
wanted
to
help
him
to
the
bench
it
is
nothing
replied
nils
made
some
wavering
steps
across
the
floor
then
some
firm
ones
and
turning
asked
for
a
all
the
girls
had
come
to
the
front
casting
a
long
lingering
look
about
him
he
went
straightway
to
one
of
them
in
a
dark
skirt
it
was
birgit
böen
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
gave
him
both
of
hers
then
he
laughed
drew
back
caught
hold
of
the
girl
beside
her
and
danced
away
with
perfect
abandon
the
blood
coursed
up
in
birgit
neck
and
face
a
tall
man
with
a
mild
countenance
was
standing
directly
behind
her
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
danced
off
after
nils
the
latter
saw
this
and
it
might
have
been
only
through
heedlessness
he
danced
so
hard
against
them
that
the
man
and
birgit
were
sent
reeling
over
and
fell
heavily
on
the
floor
shouting
and
laughter
arose
about
them
birgit
got
up
at
last
went
aside
and
wept
bitterly
the
man
with
the
mild
face
rose
more
slowly
and
went
straight
over
to
nils
who
was
still
dancing
you
had
better
stop
a
little
said
the
man
nils
did
not
hear
and
then
the
man
took
him
by
the
arm
nils
tore
himself
away
and
looked
at
him
i
do
not
know
you
said
he
with
a
smile
no
but
you
shall
learn
to
know
me
said
the
man
with
the
mild
face
and
with
this
he
struck
nils
a
blow
over
one
eye
nils
who
was
wholly
unprepared
for
this
was
plunged
heavily
across
the
and
when
he
promptly
tried
to
rise
he
found
that
he
could
not
his
back
was
broken
at
kampen
a
change
had
taken
place
the
grandmother
had
been
growing
very
feeble
of
late
and
when
she
realized
this
she
strove
harder
than
ever
to
save
money
enough
to
pay
off
the
last
installment
on
the
gard
then
you
and
the
boy
will
have
all
you
need
she
said
to
her
daughter
and
if
you
let
any
one
come
in
and
waste
it
for
you
i
will
turn
in
my
grave
during
the
autumn
too
she
had
the
pleasure
of
being
able
to
stroll
up
to
the
former
with
the
last
remaining
portion
of
the
debt
and
happy
was
she
when
she
had
taken
her
seat
again
and
could
say
now
that
is
done
but
at
that
very
time
she
was
attacked
by
her
last
illness
she
betook
herself
forthwith
to
her
bed
and
never
rose
again
her
daughter
buried
her
in
a
vacant
spot
in
the
churchyard
and
placed
over
her
a
handsome
cross
whereon
was
inscribed
her
name
and
age
with
a
verse
from
one
of
kingo
hymns
a
fortnight
after
the
grandmother
was
laid
in
her
grave
her
sunday
gown
was
made
over
into
clothes
for
the
boy
and
when
he
put
them
on
he
became
as
solemn
as
though
he
were
his
grandmother
come
back
again
of
his
own
accord
he
went
to
the
book
with
big
print
and
large
clasps
she
had
read
and
sung
from
every
sunday
opened
it
and
there
inside
found
her
spectacles
these
the
boy
had
never
been
permitted
to
touch
during
his
lifetime
now
he
timidly
took
them
up
put
them
on
his
nose
and
looked
through
them
into
the
book
all
was
misty
how
strange
thought
the
boy
it
was
through
them
grandmother
could
read
the
word
of
god
he
held
them
high
up
toward
the
light
to
see
what
the
matter
was
and
the
spectacles
lay
on
the
floor
he
was
much
alarmed
and
when
the
door
at
that
moment
opened
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
his
grandmother
must
be
coming
in
but
it
was
his
mother
and
behind
her
six
men
who
with
much
tramping
and
noise
were
bearing
in
a
litter
which
they
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
for
a
long
time
the
door
was
left
open
so
that
it
grew
cold
in
the
room
on
the
litter
lay
a
man
with
dark
hair
and
pale
face
the
mother
moved
about
weeping
lay
him
carefully
on
the
bed
she
begged
herself
lending
a
helping
hand
but
while
the
men
were
moving
with
him
something
made
a
noise
under
their
feet
oh
it
is
only
spectacles
thought
the
boy
but
he
did
not
say
so
chapter
iii
it
was
in
the
autumn
as
before
stated
a
week
after
nils
the
tailor
was
borne
into
margit
kampen
home
there
came
word
to
him
from
the
americans
that
he
must
hold
himself
in
readiness
to
start
he
lay
just
then
writhing
under
a
terrible
attack
of
pain
and
gnashing
his
teeth
he
shrieked
let
them
go
to
hell
margit
stood
motionless
as
though
he
had
made
no
answer
he
noticed
this
and
presently
he
repeated
slowly
and
feebly
let
them
go
as
the
winter
advanced
he
improved
so
much
that
he
was
able
to
sit
up
although
his
health
was
shattered
for
life
the
first
time
he
actually
sat
up
he
took
out
his
fiddle
and
tuned
it
but
became
so
agitated
that
he
had
to
go
to
bed
again
he
grew
very
taciturn
but
was
not
hard
to
get
along
with
and
as
time
wore
on
he
taught
the
boy
to
read
and
began
to
take
work
in
at
home
he
never
went
out
and
would
not
talk
with
those
who
dropped
in
to
see
him
at
first
margit
used
to
bring
him
the
parish
news
he
was
always
gloomy
afterwards
so
she
ceased
to
do
so
when
spring
had
fairly
set
in
he
and
margit
would
sit
longer
than
usual
talking
together
after
the
evening
meal
the
boy
was
then
sent
off
to
bed
some
time
later
in
the
spring
their
bans
were
published
in
church
after
which
they
were
quietly
married
he
did
his
share
of
work
in
the
fields
now
and
managed
everything
in
a
sensible
orderly
way
margit
said
to
the
boy
there
is
both
profit
and
pleasure
in
him
now
you
must
be
obedient
and
good
that
you
may
do
your
best
for
him
margit
had
remained
tolerably
stout
through
all
her
sorrow
she
had
a
ruddy
face
and
very
large
eyes
which
looked
all
the
larger
because
there
was
a
ring
round
them
she
had
full
lips
a
round
face
and
looked
healthy
and
strong
although
she
was
not
very
strong
at
this
period
of
her
life
she
was
looking
better
than
ever
and
she
always
sang
when
she
was
at
work
as
had
ever
been
her
wont
one
sunday
afternoon
father
and
son
went
out
to
see
how
the
crops
were
thriving
that
year
arne
ran
about
his
father
shooting
with
a
bow
and
arrow
nils
had
himself
made
them
for
the
boy
thus
they
passed
on
directly
up
toward
the
road
leading
past
the
church
and
parsonage
down
to
what
was
called
the
broad
valley
nils
seated
himself
on
a
stone
by
the
roadside
and
fell
to
dreaming
the
boy
shot
into
the
road
and
sprang
after
his
arrow
it
was
in
the
direction
of
the
church
not
too
far
away
said
the
father
while
the
boy
was
playing
there
he
paused
as
though
listening
father
i
hear
music
the
father
listened
too
they
heard
the
sounds
of
fiddling
almost
drowned
at
times
by
loud
shouts
and
wild
uproar
but
above
all
rose
the
steady
rumbling
of
and
the
clatter
of
horses
feet
it
was
a
bridal
procession
wending
its
way
home
from
church
come
here
boy
shouted
the
father
and
arne
knew
by
the
tones
of
the
voice
that
he
must
make
haste
the
father
had
hurriedly
risen
and
hidden
behind
a
large
tree
the
boy
hastened
after
him
not
here
over
there
cried
the
father
and
the
boy
stepped
behind
an
already
the
carts
were
winding
round
the
they
came
at
a
wild
speed
the
horses
were
white
with
foam
drunken
people
were
crying
and
shouting
father
and
son
counted
cart
after
cart
there
were
in
all
fourteen
in
the
first
sat
two
fiddlers
and
the
wedding
march
sounded
merrily
through
the
clear
air
a
boy
stood
behind
and
drove
afterwards
came
a
crowned
bride
who
sat
on
a
high
seat
and
glittered
in
the
sunshine
she
smiled
and
her
mouth
drew
to
one
side
beside
her
sat
a
man
clad
in
blue
and
with
a
mild
face
the
bridal
train
followed
the
men
sat
on
the
women
laps
small
boys
were
sitting
behind
drunken
men
were
driving
there
were
six
people
to
one
horse
the
man
who
presided
at
the
feast
came
in
the
last
cart
holding
a
keg
of
brandy
on
his
lap
they
passed
by
screaming
and
singing
and
drove
recklessly
down
the
hill
the
fiddling
the
voices
the
rattling
of
wheels
lingered
behind
them
in
the
dust
the
breeze
bore
up
single
shrieks
soon
only
a
dull
rumbling
and
then
nothing
nils
stood
motionless
there
was
a
rustling
behind
him
he
turned
it
was
the
boy
who
was
creeping
forward
who
was
it
father
but
the
boy
started
for
his
father
face
was
dreadful
arne
stood
motionless
waiting
for
an
answer
then
he
remained
where
he
was
because
he
got
none
after
some
time
he
became
impatient
and
ventured
again
shall
we
go
nils
was
still
gazing
after
the
bridal
train
but
he
now
controlled
himself
and
started
on
arne
followed
after
he
put
an
arrow
into
the
bow
shot
it
and
ran
do
not
trample
down
the
grass
said
nils
gruffly
the
boy
let
the
arrow
lie
and
came
back
after
a
while
he
had
forgotten
this
and
once
when
his
father
paused
he
lay
down
and
turned
summersaults
do
not
trample
down
the
grass
i
say
here
arne
was
seized
by
one
arm
and
lifted
by
it
with
such
violence
that
it
was
almost
put
out
of
joint
afterward
he
walked
quietly
behind
at
the
door
margit
awaited
them
she
had
just
come
in
from
the
stable
where
she
had
evidently
had
pretty
hard
work
for
her
hair
was
tumbled
her
linen
soiled
her
dress
likewise
but
she
stood
in
the
door
smiling
a
couple
of
the
cows
got
loose
and
have
been
into
mischief
now
they
are
tied
again
you
might
make
yourself
a
little
tidy
on
sunday
said
nils
as
he
went
past
into
the
house
yes
there
is
some
sense
in
tidying
up
now
that
the
work
is
done
said
margit
and
followed
him
she
began
to
fix
herself
at
once
and
sang
while
she
was
doing
so
now
margit
sang
well
but
sometimes
there
was
a
little
huskiness
in
her
voice
stop
that
screaming
said
nils
he
had
thrown
himself
on
his
back
across
the
bed
margit
stopped
then
the
boy
came
storming
in
there
has
come
into
the
yard
a
great
black
dog
a
dreadful
looking
hold
your
tongue
boy
said
nils
from
the
bed
and
thrust
out
one
foot
to
stamp
on
the
floor
with
it
a
devilish
noise
that
boy
is
always
making
he
muttered
afterward
and
drew
his
foot
up
again
the
mother
held
up
a
warning
finger
to
the
boy
you
surely
must
see
that
father
is
not
in
a
good
humor
she
meant
will
you
not
have
some
strong
coffee
with
syrup
in
it
said
she
she
wanted
to
put
him
in
a
good
humor
again
this
was
a
drink
the
grandmother
had
liked
and
the
rest
of
them
too
nils
did
not
like
it
at
all
but
had
drunk
it
because
the
others
did
so
will
you
not
have
some
strong
coffee
with
syrup
in
it
repeated
margit
for
he
had
made
no
reply
the
first
time
nils
raised
himself
up
on
both
elbows
and
shrieked
do
you
think
i
will
pour
down
such
slops
margit
was
struck
with
surprise
and
taking
the
boy
with
her
went
out
they
had
a
number
of
things
to
attend
to
outside
and
did
not
come
in
before
then
nils
was
gone
arne
was
sent
out
into
the
field
to
call
him
but
found
him
nowhere
they
waited
until
the
supper
was
nearly
cold
then
ate
and
still
nils
had
not
come
margit
became
uneasy
sent
the
boy
to
bed
and
sat
down
to
wait
a
little
after
midnight
nils
appeared
where
have
you
been
dear
asked
she
that
is
none
of
your
business
he
answered
and
slowly
sat
down
on
the
bench
he
was
drunk
after
this
nils
often
went
out
in
the
parish
and
always
came
home
drunk
i
can
not
stand
it
at
home
here
with
you
said
he
once
when
he
came
in
she
tried
gently
to
defend
herself
and
then
he
stamped
on
the
floor
and
bade
her
be
silent
if
he
was
drunk
it
was
her
fault
if
he
was
wicked
it
was
her
fault
too
if
he
was
a
cripple
and
an
unfortunate
being
for
his
whole
life
why
she
was
to
blame
too
and
that
infernal
boy
of
hers
why
were
you
always
dangling
after
me
said
he
and
wept
what
harm
had
i
done
you
that
you
could
not
leave
me
in
peace
lord
have
mercy
on
me
said
margit
was
it
i
who
went
after
you
yes
it
was
he
shrieked
as
he
arose
and
amid
tears
he
continued
you
have
succeeded
in
getting
what
you
wanted
i
drag
myself
about
from
tree
to
tree
i
go
every
day
and
look
at
my
own
grave
but
i
could
have
lived
in
splendor
with
the
finest
gard
girl
in
the
parish
i
might
have
traveled
as
far
as
the
sun
goes
had
not
you
and
your
damned
boy
put
yourselves
in
my
way
she
tried
again
to
defend
herself
it
was
at
all
events
not
the
fault
if
you
do
not
hold
your
tongue
i
will
strike
you
and
he
struck
her
after
he
had
slept
himself
sober
the
next
day
he
was
ashamed
and
was
especially
kind
to
the
boy
but
soon
he
was
drunk
again
and
then
he
struck
the
mother
at
last
he
got
to
striking
her
almost
every
time
he
was
drunk
the
boy
cried
and
lamented
then
he
struck
him
too
sometimes
his
repentance
was
so
deep
that
he
felt
compelled
to
leave
the
house
about
this
time
his
fondness
for
dancing
revived
he
began
to
go
about
fiddling
as
in
former
days
and
took
the
boy
with
him
to
carry
the
thus
arne
saw
a
great
deal
the
mother
wept
because
he
had
to
go
along
but
dared
not
say
so
to
the
father
hold
faithfully
to
god
and
learn
nothing
evil
she
begged
and
tenderly
caressed
her
boy
but
at
the
dances
there
was
a
great
deal
of
diversion
at
home
with
the
mother
there
was
none
at
all
arne
turned
more
and
more
from
her
and
to
the
father
she
saw
this
and
was
silent
at
the
dances
arne
learned
many
songs
and
he
sang
them
at
home
to
his
father
this
amused
the
latter
and
now
and
then
the
boy
could
even
get
him
to
laugh
this
was
so
flattering
to
arne
that
he
exerted
himself
to
learn
as
many
songs
as
possible
soon
he
noticed
what
kind
the
father
liked
best
and
what
it
was
that
made
him
laugh
when
there
was
not
enough
of
this
element
in
the
songs
he
was
singing
the
boy
added
to
it
himself
and
this
early
gave
him
practice
in
adapting
words
to
music
it
was
chiefly
lampoons
and
odious
things
about
people
who
had
risen
to
power
and
prosperity
that
the
father
liked
and
the
boy
sang
the
mother
finally
concluded
to
take
him
with
her
to
the
stable
of
evenings
numerous
were
the
pretexts
he
found
to
escape
going
but
when
nevertheless
she
managed
to
take
him
with
her
she
talked
kindly
to
him
about
god
and
good
things
usually
ending
by
taking
him
in
her
arms
and
amid
blinding
tears
begging
him
entreating
him
not
to
become
a
bad
man
the
mother
taught
the
boy
to
read
and
he
was
surprisingly
quick
at
learning
the
father
was
proud
of
this
and
especially
when
he
was
drunk
told
arne
he
had
his
head
soon
the
father
fell
into
the
habit
when
drink
got
the
better
of
him
of
calling
on
arne
at
to
sing
for
the
people
the
boy
always
obeyed
singing
song
after
song
amid
laughter
and
uproar
the
applause
pleased
the
son
almost
more
than
it
did
the
father
and
finally
there
was
no
end
to
the
songs
arne
could
sing
anxious
mothers
who
heard
this
went
themselves
to
his
mother
and
told
her
of
it
their
reason
for
so
doing
being
that
the
character
of
these
songs
was
not
what
it
should
be
the
mother
put
her
arms
about
her
boy
and
forbade
him
in
the
name
of
god
and
all
that
was
sacred
to
sing
such
songs
and
now
it
seemed
to
arne
that
everything
he
took
delight
in
his
mother
opposed
for
the
first
time
he
told
his
father
what
his
mother
had
said
she
had
to
suffer
for
this
the
next
time
the
father
was
drunk
he
held
his
peace
until
then
but
no
sooner
had
it
become
clear
to
the
boy
what
he
had
done
than
in
his
soul
he
implored
pardon
of
god
and
her
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
so
in
spoken
words
his
mother
was
just
as
kind
as
ever
to
him
and
this
cut
him
to
the
quick
once
however
he
forgot
this
he
had
a
faculty
for
mimicking
people
above
all
he
could
talk
and
sing
as
others
did
the
mother
came
in
one
evening
when
arne
was
entertaining
his
father
with
this
and
it
occurred
to
the
father
after
she
had
gone
out
that
the
boy
should
imitate
his
mother
singing
arne
refused
at
first
but
his
father
who
lay
over
on
the
bed
and
laughed
until
it
shook
insisted
finally
that
he
should
sing
like
his
mother
she
is
gone
thought
the
boy
and
can
not
hear
it
and
he
mimicked
her
singing
as
it
sounded
sometimes
when
she
was
hoarse
and
choked
with
tears
the
father
laughed
until
it
seemed
almost
hideous
to
the
boy
and
he
stopped
of
himself
just
then
the
mother
came
in
from
the
kitchen
she
looked
long
and
hard
at
the
boy
as
she
crossed
the
floor
to
a
shelf
after
a
and
turned
to
carry
it
out
a
burning
heat
ran
through
his
whole
body
she
had
heard
it
all
he
sprang
down
from
the
table
where
he
had
been
sitting
went
out
cast
himself
on
the
ground
and
it
seemed
as
though
he
must
bury
himself
out
of
sight
he
could
not
rest
and
got
up
feeling
that
he
must
go
farther
on
he
went
past
the
barn
and
behind
it
sat
the
mother
sewing
on
a
fine
new
shirt
just
for
him
she
had
always
been
in
the
habit
of
singing
a
hymn
over
her
work
when
she
sat
sewing
but
now
she
was
not
singing
she
was
not
weeping
either
she
only
sat
and
sewed
arne
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
flung
himself
down
in
the
grass
directly
in
front
of
her
looked
up
at
her
and
wept
and
sobbed
bitterly
the
mother
dropped
her
work
and
took
his
head
between
her
hands
poor
arne
said
she
and
laid
her
own
beside
his
he
did
not
try
to
say
a
word
but
wept
as
he
had
never
done
before
i
knew
you
were
good
at
heart
said
the
mother
and
stroked
down
his
hair
mother
you
must
not
say
no
to
what
i
am
going
to
ask
for
was
the
first
thing
he
could
say
that
you
know
i
can
not
do
answered
she
he
tried
to
stop
crying
and
then
stammered
out
with
his
head
still
in
her
lap
mother
sing
something
for
me
my
dear
i
can
not
said
she
softly
mother
sing
something
for
me
begged
the
boy
or
i
believe
i
will
never
be
able
to
look
at
you
again
she
stroked
his
hair
but
was
silent
mother
sing
sing
i
say
sing
he
begged
or
i
will
go
so
far
away
that
i
will
never
come
home
any
more
and
while
he
now
fourteen
in
his
fifteenth
year
as
he
was
lay
there
with
his
head
in
his
mother
lap
she
began
to
sing
over
him
father
stretch
forth
thy
mighty
hand
thy
holy
spirit
send
yonder
bless
thou
the
child
on
the
lonely
strand
nor
in
its
sports
let
it
wander
the
way
the
water
deep
lord
in
thy
arm
but
the
darling
keep
then
through
thy
mercy
will
never
drown
but
with
thee
live
forever
missing
her
child
in
disquiet
sore
much
for
its
safety
fearing
often
the
mother
calls
from
her
door
never
an
answer
hearing
then
comes
the
thought
it
be
blessed
lord
it
is
near
to
thee
jesus
will
guide
his
brother
home
to
the
anxious
mother
she
sang
several
verses
arne
lay
still
there
descended
upon
him
a
blessed
peace
and
under
its
influence
he
felt
a
refreshing
weariness
the
last
thing
he
distinctly
heard
was
about
jesus
it
bore
him
into
the
midst
of
a
great
light
and
there
it
seemed
as
though
twelve
or
thirteen
were
singing
but
the
mother
voice
rose
above
them
all
a
lovelier
voice
he
had
never
heard
he
prayed
that
he
might
sing
thus
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
were
to
sing
right
softly
he
might
do
so
and
now
he
sang
softly
tried
again
softly
and
still
more
softly
and
then
rejoiced
at
the
bliss
that
seemed
almost
dawning
for
him
he
joined
in
with
full
voice
and
the
spell
was
broken
he
awakened
looked
about
him
listened
but
heard
nothing
save
the
everlasting
mighty
roar
of
the
force
and
the
little
creek
that
flowed
past
the
barn
with
its
low
and
incessant
murmuring
the
mother
was
gone
she
had
laid
under
his
head
the
shirt
and
her
jacket
chapter
iv
when
the
time
came
to
take
the
herds
up
into
the
woods
arne
wanted
to
tend
them
his
father
objected
the
boy
had
never
tended
cattle
and
he
was
now
in
his
fifteenth
year
but
he
was
so
urgent
that
it
was
finally
arranged
as
he
wished
and
the
entire
spring
summer
and
autumn
he
was
in
the
woods
by
himself
the
livelong
day
only
going
home
to
sleep
he
took
his
books
up
there
with
him
he
read
and
carved
letters
in
the
bark
of
the
trees
he
went
about
thinking
longing
and
singing
when
he
came
home
in
the
evening
his
father
was
often
drunk
and
beat
the
mother
cursed
her
and
the
parish
and
talked
about
how
he
might
once
have
journeyed
far
away
then
the
longing
for
travel
entered
the
mind
too
there
was
no
comfort
at
home
and
the
books
opened
other
worlds
to
him
sometimes
it
seemed
as
though
the
air
too
wafted
him
far
away
over
the
lofty
mountains
so
it
happened
about
midsummer
that
he
met
kristian
the
eldest
son
who
came
with
the
servant
boy
to
the
woods
after
the
horses
in
order
to
get
a
ride
home
he
was
a
few
years
older
than
arne
and
gay
unstable
in
all
his
thoughts
but
nevertheless
firm
in
his
resolves
he
spoke
rapidly
and
in
broken
sentences
and
usually
about
two
things
at
once
rode
horseback
without
a
saddle
shot
birds
on
the
wing
went
and
seemed
to
arne
the
goal
of
his
aspirations
he
also
had
his
head
full
of
travel
and
told
arne
about
foreign
lands
until
everything
about
them
was
radiant
he
discovered
arne
fondness
for
reading
and
now
carried
up
to
him
those
books
he
had
read
himself
after
arne
had
finished
reading
these
kristian
brought
him
new
ones
he
sat
there
himself
on
sundays
and
taught
arne
how
to
find
his
way
in
the
geography
and
the
map
and
all
summer
and
autumn
arne
read
until
he
grew
pale
and
thin
in
the
winter
he
was
allowed
to
read
at
home
partly
because
he
was
to
be
confirmed
the
next
year
partly
because
he
always
knew
how
to
manage
his
father
he
began
to
go
to
school
but
there
he
took
most
comfort
when
he
closed
his
eyes
and
fancied
himself
over
his
books
at
home
besides
there
were
no
longer
any
companions
for
him
among
the
peasant
boys
his
father
of
the
mother
increased
with
years
as
did
also
his
fondness
for
drink
and
his
bodily
suffering
and
when
arne
notwithstanding
this
had
to
sit
and
amuse
him
in
order
to
furnish
the
mother
with
an
hour
peace
and
then
often
talk
of
things
he
now
in
his
heart
despised
he
felt
growing
within
him
a
hatred
for
his
father
this
he
hid
far
down
in
his
heart
as
he
did
his
love
for
his
mother
when
he
was
with
kristian
their
talk
ran
on
great
journeys
and
books
even
to
him
he
said
nothing
about
how
things
were
at
home
but
many
times
after
these
talks
when
he
was
walking
home
alone
wondering
what
might
now
meet
him
there
he
wept
and
prayed
to
god
in
the
starry
heavens
to
grant
that
he
might
soon
be
allowed
to
go
away
in
the
summer
he
and
kristian
were
confirmed
directly
afterward
the
latter
carried
out
his
plan
his
father
had
to
let
him
go
from
home
and
become
a
sailor
he
presented
arne
with
his
books
promised
to
write
often
to
him
and
went
away
now
arne
was
alone
about
this
time
he
was
again
filled
with
a
desire
to
write
songs
he
no
longer
patched
up
old
ones
he
made
new
ones
and
wove
into
them
all
that
grieved
him
most
but
his
heart
grew
too
heavy
and
his
sorrow
broke
forth
in
his
songs
he
now
lay
through
long
sleepless
nights
brooding
until
he
felt
sure
that
he
could
bear
this
no
longer
but
must
journey
far
away
seek
kristian
and
not
say
a
word
about
it
to
any
one
he
thought
of
his
mother
and
what
would
become
of
her
and
he
could
scarcely
look
her
in
the
face
he
sat
up
late
one
evening
reading
when
his
heart
became
too
gloomy
he
took
refuge
in
his
books
and
did
not
perceive
that
they
increased
the
venom
his
father
was
at
a
wedding
but
was
expected
home
that
evening
his
mother
was
tired
and
dreaded
her
husband
return
had
therefore
gone
to
bed
arne
started
up
at
the
sound
of
a
heavy
fall
in
the
passage
and
the
rattling
of
something
hard
which
struck
against
the
door
it
was
his
father
who
had
come
home
arne
opened
the
door
and
looked
at
him
is
that
you
my
clever
boy
come
and
help
your
father
up
he
was
raised
up
and
helped
in
toward
the
bench
arne
took
up
the
carried
it
in
and
closed
the
door
yes
look
at
me
you
clever
boy
i
am
not
handsome
now
this
is
no
longer
tailor
nils
this
i
say
to
you
that
you
never
shall
drink
brandy
it
is
the
world
and
the
flesh
and
the
devil
he
resisteth
the
proud
but
giveth
grace
unto
the
ah
woe
woe
is
me
how
far
it
has
gone
with
me
he
sat
still
a
while
then
he
sang
weeping
merciful
lord
i
come
to
thee
help
if
there
can
be
help
for
me
though
by
the
mire
of
sin
defiled
i
still
thine
own
dear
ransomed
child
lord
i
am
not
worthy
that
thou
shouldest
come
under
my
roof
but
speak
the
word
only
he
flung
himself
down
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
sobbed
convulsively
long
he
lay
thus
and
then
he
repeated
word
for
word
from
the
bible
as
he
had
learned
it
probably
more
than
twenty
years
before
then
she
came
and
worshiped
him
saying
lord
help
me
but
he
answered
and
said
it
is
not
meet
to
take
the
children
bread
and
to
cast
it
to
dogs
and
she
said
truth
lord
yet
the
dogs
eat
of
the
crumbs
which
fall
from
their
master
table
he
was
silent
now
and
dissolved
in
a
flood
of
tears
the
mother
had
awakened
long
since
but
had
not
dared
raise
her
eyes
now
that
her
husband
was
weeping
like
one
who
is
saved
she
leaned
on
her
elbows
and
looked
up
but
scarcely
had
nils
descried
her
than
he
shrieked
out
are
you
staring
at
me
you
too
you
want
to
see
i
suppose
what
you
have
brought
me
to
aye
this
is
the
way
i
look
exactly
so
he
rose
up
and
she
hid
herself
under
the
robe
no
do
not
hide
i
will
find
you
easily
enough
said
he
extending
his
right
hand
and
groping
his
way
along
with
outstretched
forefinger
tickle
tickle
said
he
as
he
drew
off
the
covers
and
placed
his
finger
on
her
throat
father
said
arne
oh
dear
how
shriveled
up
and
thin
you
have
grown
there
is
not
much
flesh
here
tickle
tickle
the
mother
convulsively
seized
his
hand
with
both
of
hers
but
could
not
free
herself
and
so
rolled
herself
into
a
ball
father
said
arne
so
life
has
come
into
you
now
how
she
writhes
the
fright
tickle
tickle
father
said
arne
the
room
seemed
to
swim
about
him
tickle
i
say
she
let
go
his
hands
and
gave
up
father
shouted
arne
he
sprang
to
the
corner
where
stood
an
axe
it
is
only
from
obstinacy
that
you
do
not
scream
you
had
better
not
do
so
either
i
have
taken
such
a
frightful
fancy
tickle
tickle
father
shrieked
arne
seizing
the
axe
but
remained
standing
as
though
nailed
to
the
spot
for
at
that
moment
the
father
drew
himself
up
gave
a
piercing
cry
clutched
at
his
breast
and
fell
over
jesus
christ
said
he
and
lay
quite
still
arne
knew
not
where
he
stood
or
what
he
stood
over
he
waited
as
it
were
for
the
room
to
burst
asunder
and
for
a
strong
light
to
break
in
somewhere
the
mother
began
to
draw
her
breath
heavily
as
though
she
were
rolling
off
some
great
weight
she
finally
half
rose
and
saw
the
father
lying
stretched
out
on
the
floor
the
son
standing
beside
him
with
an
axe
merciful
lord
what
have
you
done
she
shrieked
and
started
up
out
of
bed
threw
her
skirt
about
her
and
came
nearer
then
arne
felt
as
if
his
tongue
were
unloosed
he
fell
down
himself
said
he
arne
arne
i
do
not
believe
you
cried
the
mother
in
a
loud
rebuking
tone
now
jesus
be
with
you
and
she
flung
herself
over
the
corpse
with
piteous
lamentation
now
the
boy
came
out
of
his
stupor
and
dropping
down
on
his
knees
exclaimed
as
surely
as
i
look
for
mercy
from
god
he
fell
as
he
stood
there
then
our
lord
himself
has
been
here
said
she
quietly
and
sitting
on
the
floor
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
corpse
nils
lay
precisely
as
he
fell
stiff
with
open
eyes
and
mouth
his
hands
had
drawn
near
together
as
though
he
had
tried
to
clasp
them
but
had
been
unable
to
do
so
take
hold
of
your
father
you
are
so
strong
and
help
me
lay
him
on
the
bed
and
they
took
hold
of
him
and
laid
him
on
the
bed
margit
closed
his
eyes
and
mouth
stretched
him
out
and
folded
his
hands
mother
and
son
stood
and
looked
at
him
all
they
had
experienced
until
then
neither
seemed
so
long
nor
contained
so
much
as
this
moment
if
the
devil
himself
had
been
there
the
lord
had
been
there
also
the
encounter
had
been
short
all
the
past
was
now
settled
it
was
a
little
after
midnight
and
they
had
to
be
there
with
the
dead
man
until
day
dawned
arne
crossed
the
floor
and
made
a
great
fire
on
the
hearth
the
mother
sat
down
by
it
and
now
as
she
sat
there
it
rushed
through
her
mind
how
many
evil
days
she
had
had
with
nils
and
then
she
thanked
god
in
a
loud
fervent
prayer
for
what
he
had
done
but
i
have
truly
had
some
good
days
also
said
she
and
wept
as
though
she
regretted
her
recent
thankfulness
and
it
ended
in
her
taking
the
greatest
blame
on
herself
who
had
acted
contrary
to
commandment
out
of
love
for
the
departed
one
had
been
disobedient
to
her
mother
and
therefore
had
been
punished
through
this
sinful
love
arne
sat
down
directly
opposite
her
the
mother
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
bed
arne
you
must
remember
that
it
was
for
your
sake
i
bore
it
all
and
she
wept
yearning
for
a
loving
word
in
order
to
gain
a
support
against
her
own
and
comfort
for
all
coming
time
the
boy
trembled
and
could
not
answer
you
must
never
leave
me
sobbed
she
then
it
came
suddenly
to
his
mind
what
she
had
been
in
all
this
time
of
sorrow
and
how
boundless
would
be
her
desolation
should
he
as
a
reward
for
her
great
fidelity
forsake
her
now
never
never
he
whispered
longing
to
go
to
her
yet
unable
to
do
so
they
kept
their
seats
but
their
tears
flowed
freely
together
she
prayed
aloud
now
for
the
dead
man
now
for
herself
and
her
boy
and
thus
amid
prayers
and
tears
the
time
passed
finally
she
said
arne
you
have
such
a
fine
voice
you
must
sit
over
by
the
bed
and
sing
for
your
father
and
it
seemed
as
though
strength
was
forthwith
given
him
to
do
so
he
got
up
and
went
to
fetch
a
then
lit
a
torch
and
with
the
torch
in
one
hand
the
in
the
other
he
sat
down
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
in
a
clear
voice
sang
kingo
one
hundred
and
hymn
turn
from
us
gracious
lord
thy
dire
displeasure
let
not
thy
bloody
rod
beyond
all
measure
chasten
thy
children
laden
with
sore
oppressions
for
our
transgressions
chapter
arne
became
habitually
silent
and
shy
he
tended
cattle
and
made
songs
he
passed
his
nineteenth
birthday
and
still
he
kept
on
tending
cattle
he
borrowed
books
from
the
priest
and
read
but
he
took
interest
in
nothing
else
the
priest
sent
word
to
him
one
day
that
he
had
better
become
a
because
the
parish
ought
to
derive
benefit
from
your
talents
and
knowledge
arne
made
no
reply
to
this
but
the
next
day
while
driving
the
sheep
before
him
he
made
the
following
song
oh
my
pet
lamb
lift
your
head
though
the
stoniest
path
you
tread
over
the
mountains
lonely
still
your
bells
follow
only
oh
my
pet
lamb
walk
with
care
lest
you
spoil
all
your
wool
beware
mother
must
soon
be
sewing
skins
for
the
summer
going
oh
my
pet
lamb
try
to
grow
fat
and
fine
you
go
know
you
not
little
sweeting
a
spring
lamb
is
dainty
eating
one
day
in
his
twentieth
year
arne
chanced
to
overhear
a
conversation
between
his
mother
and
the
wife
of
the
former
gard
owner
they
were
disputing
about
the
horse
they
owned
in
common
i
must
wait
to
hear
what
arne
says
remarked
the
mother
that
lazy
fellow
was
the
reply
he
would
like
i
dare
say
to
have
the
horse
go
ranging
about
the
woods
as
he
does
himself
the
mother
was
now
silent
although
before
she
had
been
arguing
her
own
case
well
arne
turned
as
red
as
fire
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
that
his
mother
might
have
to
listen
to
taunting
words
for
his
sake
and
yet
perhaps
she
had
often
been
obliged
to
do
so
why
had
she
not
told
him
of
this
he
considered
the
matter
well
and
now
it
struck
him
that
his
mother
scarcely
ever
talked
with
him
but
neither
did
he
talk
with
her
with
whom
did
he
talk
after
all
often
on
sunday
when
he
sat
quietly
at
home
he
felt
a
desire
to
read
sermons
to
his
mother
whose
eyes
were
poor
she
had
wept
too
much
in
her
day
but
he
did
not
have
the
courage
to
do
so
many
times
he
had
wanted
to
offer
to
read
aloud
to
her
from
his
own
books
when
all
was
still
in
the
house
and
he
thought
the
time
must
hang
heavily
on
her
hands
but
his
courage
failed
him
for
this
too
it
can
not
matter
much
i
must
give
up
tending
the
herds
and
move
down
to
mother
he
let
several
days
pass
and
became
firm
in
his
resolve
then
he
drove
the
cattle
far
around
in
the
wood
and
made
the
following
song
the
vale
is
full
of
trouble
but
here
sweet
peace
may
reign
within
this
quiet
forest
no
bailiffs
may
distrain
none
fight
as
in
the
vale
in
the
blessed
church
name
yet
if
a
church
were
here
it
would
no
doubt
be
just
the
same
how
peaceful
is
the
forest
true
the
hawk
is
far
from
kind
i
fear
he
now
is
striving
the
plumpest
sparrow
to
find
i
fear
yon
eagle
coming
to
rob
the
kid
of
breath
and
yet
perchance
if
long
it
lived
it
might
be
tired
to
death
the
woodman
fells
one
tree
and
another
rots
away
the
red
fox
killed
the
lambkin
white
at
sunset
yesterday
the
wolf
though
killed
the
fox
and
the
wolf
itself
must
die
for
arne
shot
him
down
before
the
dew
was
dry
i
hie
me
to
the
valley
back
the
forest
is
as
bad
and
i
must
see
to
take
good
heed
lest
thinking
drive
me
mad
i
saw
a
boy
in
my
dreams
though
where
i
can
not
tell
but
i
know
he
had
killed
his
father
i
think
it
was
in
hell
he
came
home
and
told
his
mother
that
she
might
send
out
in
the
parish
after
another
he
wanted
to
manage
the
gard
himself
thus
it
was
arranged
but
the
mother
was
always
after
him
with
warnings
not
to
overtax
himself
with
work
she
used
also
to
prepare
such
good
meals
for
him
at
this
time
that
he
often
felt
ashamed
but
he
said
nothing
he
was
working
at
a
song
the
refrain
of
which
was
over
the
lofty
mountains
he
never
succeeded
in
finishing
it
and
this
was
chiefly
because
he
wanted
to
have
the
refrain
in
every
other
line
finally
he
gave
it
up
but
many
of
the
songs
he
made
got
out
among
the
people
where
they
were
well
liked
there
were
those
who
wished
very
much
to
talk
with
him
especially
as
they
had
known
him
from
boyhood
up
but
arne
was
shy
of
all
whom
he
did
not
know
and
thought
ill
of
them
chiefly
because
he
believed
they
thought
ill
of
him
his
constant
companion
in
the
fields
was
a
man
called
upland
knut
who
had
a
habit
of
singing
over
his
work
but
he
always
sang
the
same
song
after
listening
to
this
for
a
few
months
arne
was
moved
to
ask
him
if
he
did
not
know
any
others
no
was
the
man
reply
then
after
the
lapse
of
several
days
once
when
knut
was
singing
his
song
arne
asked
how
did
you
chance
to
learn
this
oh
it
just
happened
so
said
the
man
arne
went
straight
from
him
into
the
house
but
there
sat
his
mother
weeping
a
sight
he
had
not
seen
since
his
father
death
he
pretended
not
to
notice
her
and
went
toward
the
door
again
but
he
felt
his
mother
looking
sorrowfully
after
him
again
and
he
had
to
stop
what
are
you
crying
for
mother
for
a
while
his
words
were
the
only
sound
in
the
room
and
therefore
they
came
back
to
him
again
and
again
so
often
that
he
felt
they
had
not
been
said
gently
enough
he
asked
once
more
what
are
you
crying
for
oh
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
but
now
she
wept
harder
than
ever
he
waited
a
long
time
then
was
forced
to
say
as
courageously
as
he
could
there
must
be
something
you
are
crying
about
again
there
was
silence
he
felt
very
guilty
although
had
said
nothing
and
knew
nothing
it
just
happened
so
said
the
mother
presently
she
added
i
am
after
all
most
fortunate
and
then
she
wept
but
arne
hastened
out
and
he
felt
drawn
toward
the
kamp
gorge
he
sat
down
to
look
into
it
and
while
he
was
sitting
there
he
too
wept
if
i
only
knew
what
i
was
crying
for
mused
arne
above
him
in
the
field
upland
knut
was
singing
his
song
ingerid
sletten
of
had
no
costly
trinkets
to
wear
but
a
cap
she
had
that
was
far
more
fair
although
it
was
only
of
wool
it
had
no
trimming
and
now
was
old
but
her
mother
who
long
had
gone
had
given
it
her
and
so
it
shone
to
ingerid
more
than
gold
for
twenty
years
she
laid
it
aside
that
it
might
not
be
worn
away
cap
i
wear
on
that
blissful
day
when
i
shall
become
a
bride
for
thirty
years
she
laid
it
aside
lest
the
colors
might
fade
away
cap
i
wear
when
to
god
i
pray
a
happy
and
grateful
bride
for
forty
years
she
laid
it
aside
still
holding
her
mother
as
dear
little
cap
i
certainly
fear
i
never
shall
be
a
bride
she
went
to
look
for
the
cap
one
day
in
the
chest
where
it
long
had
lain
but
ah
her
looking
was
all
in
vain
the
cap
had
moldered
away
arne
sat
and
listened
as
though
the
words
had
been
music
far
away
up
the
slope
he
went
up
to
knut
have
you
a
mother
asked
he
no
have
you
a
father
oh
no
i
have
no
father
is
it
long
since
they
died
oh
yes
it
is
long
since
you
have
not
many
i
dare
say
who
care
for
you
oh
no
not
many
have
you
any
one
here
no
not
here
but
yonder
in
your
native
parish
oh
no
not
there
either
have
you
not
any
one
at
all
who
cares
for
you
oh
no
i
have
not
but
arne
went
from
him
loving
his
own
mother
so
intensely
that
it
seemed
as
though
his
heart
would
break
and
he
felt
as
it
were
a
blissful
light
over
him
thou
heavenly
father
thought
he
thou
hast
given
her
to
me
and
such
unspeakable
love
with
the
gift
and
i
put
this
away
from
me
and
one
day
when
i
want
it
she
will
be
perhaps
no
more
he
felt
a
desire
to
go
to
her
if
for
nothing
else
only
to
look
at
her
but
on
the
way
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
perhaps
because
you
did
not
appreciate
her
you
may
soon
have
to
endure
the
grief
of
losing
her
he
stood
still
at
once
almighty
god
what
then
would
become
of
me
he
felt
as
though
some
calamity
must
be
happening
at
home
he
hastened
toward
the
house
cold
sweat
stood
on
his
brow
his
feet
scarcely
touched
the
ground
he
tore
open
the
passage
door
but
within
the
whole
atmosphere
was
at
once
filled
with
peace
he
softly
opened
the
door
into
the
the
mother
had
gone
to
bed
the
moon
shone
full
in
her
face
and
she
lay
sleeping
calmly
as
a
child
chapter
vi
some
days
after
this
mother
and
son
who
of
late
had
been
more
together
agreed
to
be
present
at
the
wedding
of
some
relatives
at
a
neighboring
gard
the
mother
had
not
been
to
any
party
since
she
was
a
girl
they
knew
few
people
at
the
wedding
save
by
name
and
arne
thought
it
especially
strange
that
everybody
stared
at
him
wherever
he
went
once
some
words
were
spoken
behind
him
in
the
passage
he
was
not
sure
but
he
fancied
he
understood
them
and
every
drop
of
blood
rushed
into
his
face
whenever
he
thought
of
them
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
the
man
who
had
spoken
these
words
finally
he
took
a
seat
beside
him
but
as
he
drew
up
to
the
table
he
thought
the
conversation
took
another
turn
well
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
story
which
proves
that
nothing
can
be
buried
so
deep
down
in
night
that
it
will
not
find
its
way
into
daylight
said
the
man
and
arne
was
sure
he
looked
at
he
was
an
man
with
thin
red
hair
encircling
a
great
round
brow
beneath
were
a
pair
of
very
small
eyes
and
a
little
nose
but
the
mouth
was
very
large
with
very
pale
lips
when
he
laughed
he
showed
his
gums
his
hands
lay
on
the
table
they
were
clumsy
and
coarse
but
the
wrists
were
slender
he
looked
sharp
and
talked
fast
but
with
much
effort
people
nicknamed
him
the
and
arne
knew
that
tailor
nils
had
dealt
roughly
with
him
in
the
old
days
yes
there
is
a
great
deal
of
wickedness
in
this
world
it
comes
nearer
home
to
us
than
we
think
but
no
matter
you
shall
hear
now
of
an
ugly
deed
those
who
are
old
remember
alf
scrip
alf
to
come
back
said
alf
that
saying
comes
from
him
for
when
he
had
struck
a
bargain
and
he
could
trade
that
fellow
he
flung
his
scrip
on
his
back
to
come
back
said
alf
a
devilish
good
fellow
fine
fellow
splendid
fellow
this
alf
scrip
alf
well
there
was
alf
and
big
aye
you
knew
big
he
was
big
and
he
was
lazy
too
he
looked
too
long
at
a
shining
black
horse
scrip
alf
drove
and
had
trained
to
spring
like
a
summer
frog
and
before
big
knew
what
he
was
about
he
had
given
fifty
dollars
for
the
nag
big
mounted
a
carriole
as
large
as
life
to
drive
like
a
king
with
his
horse
but
now
he
might
lash
and
swear
until
the
gard
was
all
in
a
smoke
the
horse
ran
for
all
that
against
all
the
doors
and
walls
that
were
in
the
way
he
was
stone
blind
afterwards
alf
and
big
fell
to
quarreling
about
this
horse
all
through
the
parish
just
like
a
couple
of
dogs
big
wanted
his
money
back
but
you
may
believe
he
never
got
so
much
as
two
danish
shillings
scrip
alf
thrashed
him
until
the
hair
flew
to
come
back
said
alf
devilish
good
fellow
fine
fellow
splendid
fellow
this
alf
scrip
alf
well
then
some
years
passed
by
without
his
being
heard
of
again
it
might
have
been
ten
years
later
that
he
was
published
on
the
church
hill
there
had
been
left
to
him
a
tremendous
fortune
big
was
standing
by
knew
very
well
said
he
it
was
money
that
was
crying
for
scrip
alf
and
not
people
now
there
was
a
great
deal
of
gossip
about
alf
and
out
of
it
all
was
gathered
that
he
had
been
seen
last
on
this
side
of
rören
and
not
on
the
other
yes
you
remember
the
rören
road
the
old
road
but
big
had
succeeded
in
rising
to
great
power
and
splendor
owning
both
farm
and
complete
outfit
moreover
he
had
professed
great
piety
and
everybody
knew
he
did
not
become
pious
for
nothing
any
more
than
other
folks
do
people
began
to
talk
about
it
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
rören
road
was
to
be
changed
folks
wanted
to
go
straight
ahead
and
so
it
went
directly
over
rören
but
we
like
things
level
and
so
the
road
now
runs
down
by
the
river
there
was
a
mining
and
a
blasting
until
one
might
have
expected
rören
to
come
tumbling
down
all
sorts
of
officials
came
there
but
the
amtmand
oftenest
of
all
for
he
was
allowed
double
mileage
and
now
one
day
while
they
were
digging
down
among
the
rocks
some
one
went
to
pick
up
a
stone
but
got
hold
of
a
hand
that
was
sticking
out
of
the
rocks
and
so
strong
was
this
hand
that
it
sent
the
man
who
took
hold
of
it
reeling
backwards
now
he
who
found
this
hand
was
big
the
lensmand
was
sauntering
about
there
he
was
called
and
the
skeleton
of
a
whole
man
was
dug
out
the
doctor
was
sent
for
too
he
put
the
bones
so
skillfully
together
that
now
only
the
flesh
was
wanting
but
people
claimed
that
this
skeleton
was
precisely
the
same
size
as
scrip
alf
to
come
back
said
alf
every
one
thought
it
most
strange
that
a
dead
hand
could
upset
a
fellow
like
big
even
when
it
did
not
strike
at
all
the
lensmand
talked
seriously
to
him
about
it
of
course
when
no
one
was
by
to
hear
but
then
big
swore
until
everything
grew
black
about
the
lensmand
well
said
the
lensmand
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
you
are
just
the
fellow
to
go
to
bed
with
the
skeleton
hey
be
sure
i
am
replied
big
and
now
the
doctor
jointed
the
bones
firmly
together
and
placed
the
skeleton
in
one
of
the
beds
of
the
barracks
in
the
other
big
was
to
sleep
but
the
lensmand
laid
down
in
his
gown
close
up
to
the
wall
when
it
grew
dark
and
big
had
to
go
in
to
his
it
just
seemed
as
though
the
door
shut
of
itself
and
he
stood
in
the
dark
but
big
fell
to
singing
hymns
for
he
had
a
strong
voice
are
you
singing
hymns
asked
the
lensmand
outside
of
the
wall
one
knows
whether
he
has
had
the
chorister
answered
big
afterward
he
fell
to
praying
with
all
his
might
are
you
praying
asked
the
lensmand
outside
of
the
wall
has
no
doubt
been
a
great
sinner
answered
big
then
for
a
long
time
all
was
still
and
it
really
seemed
as
though
the
lensmand
must
be
sleeping
then
there
was
a
shriek
that
made
the
barracks
shake
to
come
back
an
infernal
noise
and
uproar
arose
over
those
fifty
dollars
of
mine
bellowed
big
and
there
followed
a
screaming
and
a
wrestling
the
lensmand
flung
open
the
door
people
rushed
in
with
sticks
and
stones
and
there
lay
big
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
on
him
was
the
skeleton
it
was
very
still
around
the
table
finally
a
man
who
was
about
to
light
his
clay
pipe
said
he
surely
went
mad
after
that
day
he
did
arne
felt
every
one
looking
at
him
and
therefore
he
could
not
raise
his
eyes
it
is
as
i
have
said
put
in
the
first
speaker
nothing
can
be
buried
so
deep
down
in
night
that
it
will
not
find
its
way
into
daylight
well
now
i
will
tell
about
a
son
who
beat
his
own
father
said
a
fair
man
with
a
round
face
arne
knew
not
where
he
was
sitting
it
was
a
bully
of
a
powerful
race
over
in
hardanger
he
was
the
ruin
of
many
people
his
father
and
he
disagreed
about
the
yearly
allowance
and
the
result
of
this
was
that
the
man
had
no
peace
at
home
or
in
the
parish
owing
to
this
he
grew
more
and
more
wicked
and
his
father
took
him
to
task
will
take
rebuke
from
no
one
said
the
son
me
you
shall
take
it
as
long
as
i
live
said
the
father
you
do
not
hold
your
tongue
i
will
beat
you
said
the
son
and
sprang
to
his
feet
do
so
if
you
dare
and
you
will
never
prosper
in
the
world
answered
the
father
as
he
too
rose
you
think
so
and
the
son
rushed
at
him
and
knocked
him
down
but
the
father
did
not
resist
he
crossed
his
arms
and
let
his
son
do
as
he
chose
with
him
the
son
beat
him
seized
hold
of
him
and
dragged
him
to
the
door
will
have
peace
in
the
house
but
when
they
came
to
the
door
the
father
raised
himself
up
farther
than
to
the
door
said
he
so
far
i
dragged
my
own
father
the
son
paid
no
heed
to
this
but
dragged
his
head
across
the
threshold
farther
than
to
the
door
i
say
here
the
old
man
flung
his
son
down
at
his
feet
and
chastised
him
just
as
though
he
were
a
child
that
was
badly
done
said
several
did
not
strike
his
father
though
arne
thought
some
one
said
but
he
was
not
sure
of
it
now
i
shall
tell
something
said
arne
rising
up
as
pale
as
death
not
knowing
what
he
was
going
to
say
he
only
saw
the
words
floating
about
him
like
great
i
will
make
a
grasp
at
them
and
he
began
a
troll
met
a
boy
who
was
walking
along
a
road
crying
whom
are
you
most
afraid
said
the
troll
yourself
or
of
others
but
the
boy
was
crying
because
he
had
dreamed
in
the
night
that
he
had
been
forced
to
kill
his
wicked
father
and
so
he
answered
am
most
afraid
of
myself
be
at
peace
with
yourself
and
never
cry
any
more
for
hereafter
you
shall
only
be
at
war
with
others
and
the
troll
went
his
way
but
the
first
person
the
boy
met
laughed
at
him
and
so
the
boy
had
to
laugh
back
again
the
next
person
he
met
struck
him
the
boy
had
to
defend
himself
and
struck
back
the
third
person
he
met
tried
to
kill
him
and
so
the
boy
had
to
take
his
life
then
everybody
said
hard
things
about
him
and
therefore
he
knew
only
hard
things
to
say
of
everybody
they
locked
their
cupboards
and
doors
against
him
so
he
had
to
steal
his
way
to
what
he
needed
he
even
had
to
steal
his
rest
since
they
would
not
let
him
do
anything
good
he
had
to
do
something
bad
then
the
parish
said
must
get
rid
of
this
boy
he
is
so
bad
and
one
fine
day
they
put
him
out
of
the
way
but
the
boy
had
not
the
least
idea
that
he
had
done
anything
wicked
and
so
after
death
he
came
strolling
right
into
the
presence
of
the
lord
there
on
a
bench
sat
the
father
he
had
not
slain
and
right
opposite
on
another
bench
sat
all
those
who
had
forced
him
to
do
wrong
bench
are
you
afraid
of
asked
the
lord
and
the
boy
pointed
to
the
long
one
down
there
beside
your
father
said
the
lord
and
the
boy
turned
to
do
so
then
the
father
fell
from
the
bench
with
a
great
gash
in
his
neck
in
his
place
there
came
one
in
the
likeness
of
the
boy
with
repentant
countenance
and
ghastly
features
then
another
with
drunken
face
and
drooping
form
still
another
with
the
face
of
a
madman
with
tattered
clothes
and
with
hideous
laughter
it
might
have
been
with
you
said
the
lord
that
really
be
replied
the
boy
touching
the
hem
of
the
garment
then
both
benches
fell
down
from
heaven
and
the
boy
stood
beside
the
lord
again
and
laughed
this
when
you
awaken
said
the
lord
and
at
that
moment
the
boy
awoke
now
the
boy
who
dreamed
thus
is
i
and
they
who
tempted
him
by
thinking
him
wicked
are
you
i
no
longer
fear
myself
but
i
am
afraid
of
you
do
not
stir
up
my
evil
passions
for
it
is
doubtful
whether
i
may
get
hold
of
the
lord
garment
he
rushed
out
and
the
men
looked
at
each
other
chapter
vii
it
was
the
next
day
in
the
barn
of
the
same
gard
arne
had
been
drunk
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
was
ill
in
consequence
of
it
and
had
been
lying
in
the
barn
almost
hours
now
turning
over
he
had
propped
himself
up
on
his
elbows
and
thus
talked
with
himself
everything
i
look
at
becomes
cowardice
that
i
did
not
run
away
when
i
was
a
boy
was
cowardice
that
i
listened
to
father
rather
than
to
mother
was
cowardice
that
i
sang
those
wicked
songs
for
him
was
cowardice
i
became
a
that
was
from
cowardice
i
took
to
reading
oh
yes
that
was
from
cowardice
too
i
wanted
to
hide
away
from
myself
even
after
i
was
grown
up
i
did
not
help
mother
against
father
cowardice
that
i
did
not
that
night
ugh
cowardice
i
should
most
likely
have
waited
until
was
killed
i
could
not
stand
it
at
home
after
that
cowardice
neither
did
i
go
my
way
cowardice
i
did
nothing
i
tended
cattle
cowardice
to
be
sure
i
had
promised
mother
to
stay
with
her
but
i
should
actually
have
been
cowardly
enough
to
break
the
promise
had
i
not
been
afraid
to
mingle
with
people
for
i
am
afraid
of
people
chiefly
because
i
believe
they
see
how
bad
i
am
and
it
is
fear
of
people
makes
me
speak
ill
of
them
cursed
cowardice
i
make
rhymes
from
cowardice
i
dare
not
think
in
a
straightforward
manner
about
my
own
affairs
and
so
i
turn
to
those
of
others
and
that
is
to
be
a
poet
i
should
have
sat
down
and
cried
until
the
hills
were
turned
into
water
that
is
what
i
should
have
done
but
instead
i
say
hush
and
set
myself
to
rocking
and
even
my
songs
are
cowardly
for
were
they
courageous
they
would
be
better
i
am
afraid
of
strong
thoughts
afraid
of
everything
that
is
strong
if
i
do
rise
up
to
strength
it
is
in
a
frenzy
and
frenzy
is
cowardice
i
am
more
clever
more
capable
better
informed
than
i
seem
to
be
i
am
better
than
my
words
but
through
cowardice
i
dare
not
be
what
i
am
fy
i
drank
brandy
from
cowardice
i
wanted
to
deaden
the
pain
fy
it
hurt
i
drank
nevertheless
drank
nevertheless
drank
my
father
heart
blood
and
yet
i
drank
the
fact
is
my
cowardice
is
beyond
all
bounds
but
the
most
cowardly
thing
of
all
is
that
i
can
sit
here
and
say
all
this
to
myself
kill
myself
pooh
for
that
i
am
too
cowardly
and
then
i
believe
in
god
yes
i
believe
in
god
i
long
to
go
to
him
but
cowardice
keeps
me
from
him
from
so
great
a
change
a
cowardly
person
winces
but
what
if
i
tried
as
well
as
i
am
able
almighty
god
what
if
i
tried
i
might
find
a
cure
that
even
my
milksop
nature
could
bear
for
i
have
no
bone
in
me
any
longer
nor
gristle
only
something
fluid
slush
what
if
i
tried
with
good
mild
books
i
am
afraid
of
the
strong
ones
with
pleasant
stories
and
legends
all
such
as
are
mild
and
then
a
sermon
every
sunday
and
a
prayer
every
evening
and
regular
work
that
religion
may
find
fruitful
soil
it
can
not
do
so
amid
slothfulness
what
if
i
tried
dear
gentle
god
of
my
childhood
what
if
i
tried
but
some
one
opened
the
and
hurried
across
the
floor
pale
as
death
although
drops
of
sweat
rolled
down
the
face
it
was
mother
it
was
the
second
day
she
had
been
seeking
for
her
son
she
called
his
name
but
did
not
pause
to
listen
only
called
and
rushed
about
till
he
answered
from
the
where
he
was
lying
she
gave
a
loud
shriek
sprang
to
the
mow
more
lightly
than
a
boy
and
threw
herself
upon
him
arne
arne
are
you
here
so
i
have
really
found
you
i
have
been
looking
for
you
since
yesterday
i
have
searched
the
whole
night
poor
poor
arne
i
saw
they
had
wounded
you
i
wanted
so
much
to
talk
with
you
and
comfort
you
but
then
i
never
dare
talk
with
you
arne
i
saw
you
drink
o
god
almighty
let
me
never
see
it
again
it
was
long
before
she
could
say
more
jesus
have
mercy
on
you
my
child
i
saw
you
drink
suddenly
you
were
gone
drunk
and
crushed
with
grief
as
you
were
and
i
ran
around
to
all
the
houses
i
went
far
out
in
the
field
i
did
not
find
you
i
searched
in
every
copse
i
asked
every
one
i
was
too
but
you
did
not
answer
me
arne
arne
i
walked
along
the
river
but
it
did
not
seem
to
be
deep
enough
anywhere
she
pressed
up
close
to
him
then
it
came
with
such
relief
to
my
mind
that
you
might
have
gone
home
and
i
am
sure
i
was
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
getting
over
the
road
i
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
every
room
and
then
first
remembered
that
i
myself
had
the
key
you
could
not
possibly
have
entered
arne
last
night
i
searched
along
the
road
on
both
sides
i
dared
not
go
to
the
kamp
gorge
i
know
not
how
i
came
here
no
one
helped
me
but
the
lord
put
it
into
my
heart
that
you
must
be
here
he
tried
to
soothe
her
arne
indeed
you
must
never
drink
brandy
again
no
you
may
be
sure
of
that
they
must
have
been
very
rough
with
you
were
they
rough
with
you
oh
no
it
was
i
who
was
he
laid
stress
on
the
word
i
can
not
exactly
understand
why
they
should
be
rough
with
you
what
was
it
they
did
to
you
you
will
never
tell
me
anything
and
she
began
to
weep
again
you
never
tell
me
anything
either
said
arne
gently
but
you
are
most
to
blame
arne
i
got
so
into
the
habit
of
being
silent
in
your
father
day
that
you
ought
to
have
helped
me
a
little
on
the
way
my
god
there
are
only
two
of
us
and
we
have
suffered
so
much
together
let
us
see
if
we
can
not
do
better
whispered
arne
next
sunday
i
will
read
the
sermon
to
you
god
bless
you
for
that
arne
yes
i
have
something
i
ought
to
say
to
you
say
it
mother
i
have
sinned
greatly
against
you
i
have
done
something
wrong
you
mother
and
it
touched
him
so
deeply
that
his
own
good
infinitely
patient
mother
should
accuse
herself
of
having
sinned
against
him
who
had
never
been
really
good
to
her
that
he
put
his
arm
round
her
patted
her
and
burst
into
tears
yes
i
have
and
yet
i
could
not
help
it
oh
you
have
never
wronged
me
in
any
way
yes
i
have
god
knows
it
it
was
only
because
i
was
so
fond
of
you
but
you
must
forgive
me
do
you
hear
yes
i
will
forgive
you
well
then
i
will
tell
you
about
it
another
time
but
you
will
forgive
me
oh
yes
mother
you
see
it
is
perhaps
because
of
this
that
it
has
been
so
hard
to
talk
with
you
i
have
sinned
against
you
i
beg
of
you
not
to
talk
so
mother
i
am
happy
now
having
been
able
to
say
so
much
we
must
talk
more
together
we
two
mother
yes
that
we
must
and
then
you
will
really
read
the
sermon
for
me
yes
i
will
do
so
poor
arne
god
bless
you
i
think
it
is
best
for
us
to
go
home
yes
we
will
go
home
why
are
you
looking
round
so
mother
your
father
lay
in
this
barn
and
wept
father
said
arne
and
grew
very
pale
poor
nils
it
was
the
day
you
were
christened
why
are
you
looking
round
arne
chapter
viii
from
the
day
that
arne
tried
with
his
whole
heart
to
live
closer
to
his
mother
his
relations
with
other
people
were
entirely
changed
he
looked
on
them
more
with
the
mother
mild
eyes
but
he
often
found
it
hard
to
keep
true
to
his
resolve
for
what
he
thought
most
deeply
about
his
mother
did
not
always
understand
here
is
a
song
from
those
days
it
was
such
a
pleasant
sunny
day
i
could
not
think
of
staying
i
strolled
to
the
wood
on
my
back
i
lay
and
rocked
what
my
mind
was
saying
but
there
crawled
emmets
and
gnats
stung
there
the
wasps
and
the
clegs
brought
dire
despair
dear
will
you
not
go
out
in
this
pleasant
weather
said
mother
she
sat
singing
on
the
porch
it
was
such
a
pleasant
sunny
day
i
could
not
think
of
staying
i
strayed
to
a
field
on
my
back
i
lay
and
sang
what
my
mind
was
saying
but
snakes
came
out
to
enjoy
the
sun
three
ells
were
they
long
and
away
i
run
such
pleasant
weather
we
can
go
barefoot
said
mother
and
she
pulled
off
her
stockings
it
was
such
a
pleasant
sunny
day
i
could
no
longer
tarry
i
stepped
in
a
boat
on
my
back
i
lay
the
tide
did
me
onward
carry
the
sun
though
scorched
till
my
nose
was
burned
there
limit
to
all
so
to
shore
i
turned
fine
days
these
are
for
drying
the
hay
said
mother
as
she
shook
it
with
a
rake
it
was
such
a
pleasant
sunny
day
i
could
not
think
of
staying
i
climbed
up
a
tree
and
thought
there
i
stay
for
there
were
cool
breezes
playing
a
grub
to
fall
on
my
neck
then
there
chanced
i
sprang
down
and
screamed
and
how
madly
i
danced
if
the
cow
does
not
thrive
such
a
day
as
this
she
never
will
said
mother
as
she
gazed
up
the
slope
it
was
such
a
pleasant
sunny
day
i
could
no
peace
discover
i
made
for
the
force
that
did
loudly
play
for
it
must
surely
hover
but
there
i
drowned
while
the
sun
still
shone
if
you
made
this
song
it
is
surely
not
my
own
would
take
only
about
three
such
sunny
days
to
get
everything
under
cover
said
mother
and
off
she
started
to
make
my
bed
nevertheless
this
companionship
with
his
mother
brought
every
day
more
and
more
comfort
to
arne
what
she
did
not
understand
formed
quite
as
much
of
a
tie
between
them
as
what
she
did
understand
for
the
fact
of
her
not
comprehending
a
thing
made
him
think
it
over
oftener
and
she
grew
only
the
dearer
to
him
because
he
found
her
limits
on
every
side
yes
she
became
infinitely
dear
to
him
as
a
child
arne
had
not
cared
much
for
nursery
stories
now
as
a
grown
person
he
longed
for
them
and
they
led
to
traditions
and
ancient
ballads
his
mind
was
filled
with
a
wonderful
yearning
he
walked
much
alone
and
many
of
the
places
round
about
which
formerly
he
had
not
noticed
seemed
strangely
beautiful
in
the
days
when
he
had
gone
with
those
of
his
own
age
to
the
priest
to
prepare
for
confirmation
he
had
often
played
with
them
by
a
large
lake
below
the
parsonage
called
black
water
because
it
was
deep
and
black
he
began
to
think
of
this
lake
now
and
one
evening
he
wended
his
way
thither
he
sat
down
behind
a
copse
just
at
the
foot
of
the
parsonage
this
lay
on
the
side
of
a
very
steep
hill
which
towered
up
beyond
until
it
became
a
high
mountain
the
opposite
bank
was
similar
and
therefore
huge
shadows
were
cast
over
the
lake
from
both
sides
but
in
its
centre
was
a
stripe
of
beautiful
silvery
water
all
was
at
rest
the
sun
was
just
setting
a
faint
sound
of
tinkling
bells
floated
over
from
the
opposite
shore
otherwise
profound
silence
reigned
arne
did
not
look
right
across
the
lake
but
first
turned
his
eyes
toward
its
lower
end
for
there
the
sun
was
shedding
a
sprinkling
of
burning
red
ere
it
departed
down
there
the
mountains
had
parted
to
make
room
between
them
for
a
long
low
valley
and
against
this
the
waves
dashed
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
mountains
had
gradually
sloped
together
to
form
a
swing
in
which
to
rock
this
valley
which
was
dotted
with
its
many
gards
the
curling
smoke
rose
upward
and
passed
from
sight
the
fields
were
green
and
reeking
boats
laden
with
hay
were
approaching
the
landings
arne
saw
many
people
passing
to
and
fro
but
could
hear
no
noise
thence
the
eye
wandered
beyond
the
shore
where
god
dark
forest
alone
loomed
up
through
the
forest
and
along
the
lake
men
had
drawn
a
road
as
it
were
with
a
finger
for
a
winding
streak
of
dust
plainly
marked
its
course
this
arne
eye
followed
until
it
came
directly
opposite
to
where
he
was
sitting
there
the
forest
ended
the
mountains
made
a
little
more
room
and
straightways
gard
after
gard
lay
spread
about
the
houses
were
still
larger
than
those
at
the
lower
end
were
painted
red
and
had
higher
windows
which
now
were
in
a
blaze
of
light
the
hills
sparkled
in
dazzling
sunshine
the
smallest
child
playing
about
could
be
plainly
seen
glittering
white
sand
lay
dry
on
the
shore
and
upon
this
little
children
bounded
with
their
dogs
but
suddenly
the
whole
scene
became
desolate
and
gloomy
the
houses
dark
red
the
meadows
dingy
green
the
sand
and
the
children
small
clumps
a
mass
of
mist
had
risen
above
the
mountains
and
had
shut
out
the
sun
arne
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
the
lake
there
he
found
everything
again
the
fields
were
rocking
there
and
the
forest
silently
joined
them
the
houses
stood
looking
down
doors
open
and
children
going
out
and
in
nursery
tales
and
childish
things
came
thronging
into
his
mind
as
little
fish
come
after
a
bait
swim
away
come
back
again
but
do
not
nibble
let
us
sit
down
here
until
your
mother
comes
the
priest
lady
will
surely
get
through
some
time
arne
was
startled
some
one
had
sat
down
just
behind
him
but
i
might
be
allowed
to
stay
just
this
one
night
said
a
beseeching
voice
choked
with
tears
it
seemed
to
be
that
of
a
young
girl
not
quite
grown
up
do
not
cry
any
more
it
is
shocking
to
cry
because
you
must
go
home
to
your
mother
this
last
came
in
a
mild
voice
that
spoke
slowly
and
belonged
to
a
man
that
is
not
the
reason
i
am
crying
why
are
you
crying
then
because
i
shall
no
longer
be
with
mathilde
this
was
the
name
of
the
priest
only
daughter
and
reminded
arne
that
a
peasant
girl
had
been
brought
up
with
her
that
could
not
last
forever
any
way
yes
but
just
one
day
longer
dear
and
she
sobbed
violently
it
is
best
you
should
go
home
at
once
perhaps
it
is
already
too
late
too
late
why
so
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
you
are
and
a
peasant
you
shall
remain
we
can
not
afford
to
keep
a
fine
lady
i
should
still
be
a
peasant
even
if
i
remained
here
you
are
no
judge
of
that
i
have
always
worn
peasant
clothes
it
is
not
that
which
makes
the
difference
i
have
been
spinning
and
weaving
and
cooking
it
is
not
either
i
can
talk
just
as
you
and
mother
do
not
that
either
then
i
do
not
know
what
it
can
be
said
the
girl
and
laughed
time
will
show
besides
i
am
afraid
you
already
have
too
many
ideas
ideas
ideas
you
are
always
saying
that
i
have
no
ideas
she
wept
again
oh
you
are
a
weathercock
that
you
are
the
priest
never
said
so
no
but
now
say
so
a
weathercock
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
i
will
not
be
a
weathercock
come
then
what
will
you
be
what
will
i
be
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
i
will
be
nothing
very
good
then
be
nothing
now
the
girl
laughed
presently
she
said
gravely
it
is
unkind
of
you
to
say
i
am
nothing
dear
me
when
that
was
what
you
wanted
to
be
yourself
no
i
do
not
want
to
be
nothing
very
good
then
be
everything
the
girl
laughed
presently
with
a
sorrowful
voice
the
priest
never
fooled
with
me
in
this
way
no
he
only
made
a
fool
of
you
the
priest
you
have
never
been
so
kind
to
me
as
the
priest
has
no
for
that
would
have
spoiled
you
sour
milk
can
never
become
sweet
oh
yes
when
it
is
boiled
to
whey
here
the
girl
burst
out
laughing
there
comes
your
mother
then
she
grew
sober
again
such
a
woman
as
the
priest
lady
i
have
never
met
in
all
the
days
of
my
life
here
interposed
a
shrill
rattling
voice
make
haste
now
baard
get
up
and
push
the
boat
out

will
not
get
home
the
lady
wished
me
to
see
that

her
feet
dry
dear
me

will
have
to
see
to
that
yourself

boat
asked
baard
still
without
rising
yes

and
arne
heard
her
just
then
hammering
it
in
with
the
scoop
but
get
up
i
say
baard
surely
we
are
not

all

i
am

i
have
told
you
it
is
to
wait
until
the
first
sunday
there

there

said
baard
and
they
heard
the
rattling
of
a
cart
why
i
said
it
was
to
wait
until
the
first
sunday
there
is
service
i
said
we
were
to
take
it
along
without
anything
further
the
wife
hastened
up
to
the
cart
and
carried
the
bundle
the
and
other
small
things
down
to
the
boat
then
baard
arose
went
up
and
took
the
chest
himself
but
behind
the
cart
there
came
rushing
along
a
girl
in
a
straw
hat
with
floating
hair
it
was
the
priest
daughter
eli
eli
she
called
as
she
ran
mathilde
mathilde
eli
answered
and
ran
toward
her
they
met
on
the
hill
put
their
arms
about
each
other
and
wept
then
mathilde
took
up
something
she
had
set
down
on
the
grass
it
was
a
you

have
narrifas
yes
you
shall
mother

it
too
you

after
all

narrifas
indeed
you
shall
and
then
you
will
think
of
me
and
very
often
row
row
row
over
to
me
and
the
tears
of
both
flowed
freely
eli
come
now
eli
do
not
stand
there
was
heard
from
below
but
i
want
to
go
along
said
mathilde
i
want
to
go
and
sleep
with
you
yes
yes
yes
and
with
arms
twined
about
each
other
necks
they
moved
down
toward
the
landing
presently
arne
saw
the
boat
out
on
the
water
eli
stood
high
on
the
stern
with
the
and
waved
her
hand
mathilde
was
left
behind
and
sat
on
the
stone
landing
weeping
she
remained
sitting
there
as
long
as
the
boat
was
on
the
water
it
was
but
a
short
distance
across
to
the
red
house
as
said
before
and
arne
kept
his
seat
too
he
watched
the
boat
as
she
did
it
soon
passed
into
the
darkness
and
he
waited
until
it
drew
up
to
the
shore
then
he
saw
eli
and
her
parents
in
the
water
in
it
he
followed
them
up
toward
the
houses
until
they
came
to
the
prettiest
one
of
them
all
he
saw
the
mother
go
in
first
then
the
father
with
the
chest
and
last
of
all
the
daughter
so
far
as
he
could
judge
from
their
size
soon
after
the
daughter
came
out
again
and
sat
down
in
front
of
the
door
probably
that
she
might
gaze
over
at
the
other
side
where
at
that
moment
the
sun
was
shedding
its
parting
rays
but
the
young
lady
from
the
parsonage
had
already
gone
and
arne
alone
sat
watching
eli
in
the
water
i
wonder
if
she
sees
me
he
got
up
and
moved
away
the
sun
had
set
but
the
sky
was
bright
and
clear
blue
as
it
often
is
of
a
summer
night
mist
from
land
and
water
rose
and
floated
over
the
mountains
on
both
sides
but
the
peaks
held
themselves
above
it
and
stood
peering
at
one
another
he
went
higher
up
the
lake
grew
blacker
and
deeper
and
seemed
as
it
were
to
contract
the
upper
valley
shortened
and
drew
closer
to
the
lake
the
mountains
were
nearer
to
the
eye
but
looked
more
like
a
shapeless
mass
for
the
light
of
the
sun
defines
the
sky
itself
appeared
nearer
and
all
surrounding
objects
became
friendly
and
familiar
chapter
ix
love
and
woman
were
beginning
to
play
a
prominent
part
in
his
thoughts
in
the
ancient
ballads
and
stories
of
the
olden
times
such
themes
were
reflected
as
in
a
magic
mirror
just
as
the
girl
had
been
in
the
lake
he
constantly
brooded
over
them
and
after
that
evening
he
found
pleasure
in
singing
about
them
for
they
seemed
as
it
were
to
have
come
nearer
home
to
him
but
the
thought
glided
away
and
floated
back
again
with
a
song
that
was
unknown
to
him
he
felt
as
though
another
had
made
it
for
him
fair
venevill
bounded
on
lithesome
feet
her
lover
to
meet
he
sang
till
it
sounded
afar
away
while
blithesome
birds
were
singing
on
every
blooming
spray
midsummer
day
there
is
dancing
and
play
but
now
i
know
not
whether
she
weaves
her
wreath
or
nay
she
wove
him
a
wreath
of
blue
eyes
so
true
he
took
it
but
soon
away
it
was
flung
he
sung
and
still
with
merry
singing
across
the
fields
he
sprung
midsummer
day
etc
she
wove
him
a
chain
keep
it
with
care
is
made
of
my
hair
she
yielded
him
then
in
an
hour
of
bliss
her
pure
first
kiss
but
he
blushed
as
deeply
as
she
the
while
her
lips
met
his
midsummer
day
etc
she
wove
him
a
wreath
with
a
true
right
hand
she
wove
him
another
with
roses
aglow
left
hand
now
he
took
them
gently
from
her
but
blushes
dyed
his
brow
midsummer
day
etc
she
wove
him
a
wreath
of
all
flowers
round
i
have
found
she
wept
but
she
gathered
and
wove
on
still
all
you
will
without
a
word
he
took
it
and
fled
across
the
hill
midsummer
day
etc
she
wove
on
bewildered
and
out
of
breath
bridal
wreath
she
wove
till
her
fingers
aweary
had
grown
put
it
on
but
when
she
turned
to
see
him
she
found
that
he
had
gone
midsummer
day
etc
she
wove
on
in
haste
as
for
life
and
death
her
bridal
wreath
but
the
midsummer
sun
no
longer
shone
and
the
flowers
were
gone
but
though
she
had
no
flowers
wild
fancy
still
wove
on
there
is
dancing
and
play
but
now
i
know
not
whether
she
weaves
her
wreath
or
nay
it
was
his
own
intense
melancholy
that
called
forth
the
first
image
of
love
that
glided
so
gloomily
through
his
soul
a
twofold
longing
to
have
some
one
to
love
and
to
become
something
great
blended
together
and
became
one
at
this
time
he
was
working
again
at
the
song
over
the
lofty
mountains
altering
it
and
all
the
while
singing
and
thinking
quietly
to
himself
surely
i
will
get
some
day
i
will
sing
until
i
gain
courage
he
did
not
forget
his
mother
in
these
his
thoughts
of
roving
indeed
he
took
comfort
in
the
thought
that
as
soon
as
he
got
firm
foothold
in
the
strange
land
he
would
come
back
after
her
and
offer
her
conditions
which
he
never
could
be
able
to
provide
for
her
at
home
but
in
the
midst
of
all
these
mighty
yearnings
there
played
something
calm
cheering
refined
that
darted
away
and
came
again
took
hold
and
fled
and
dreamer
that
he
had
become
he
was
more
in
the
power
of
these
spontaneous
thoughts
than
he
himself
was
aware
there
lived
in
the
parish
a
jovial
man
whose
name
was
ejnar
aasen
when
he
was
twenty
years
old
he
had
broken
his
leg
since
then
he
had
walked
with
a
cane
but
wherever
he
came
hobbling
along
there
was
always
mirth
afoot
the
man
was
rich
on
his
property
there
was
a
large
and
there
was
sure
to
be
assembled
on
one
of
the
brightest
pleasantest
days
in
autumn
a
group
of
merry
girls
gathering
nuts
at
these
he
had
plenty
of
feasting
for
his
guests
all
day
and
dancing
in
the
evening
for
most
of
these
girls
he
had
been
godfather
indeed
he
was
the
godfather
of
half
the
parish
all
the
children
called
him
godfather
and
from
them
every
one
else
both
old
and
young
learned
to
do
so
godfather
and
arne
were
well
acquainted
and
he
liked
the
young
man
because
of
the
verses
he
made
now
godfather
asked
arne
to
come
to
the
arne
blushed
and
declined
he
was
not
used
to
being
with
girls
he
said
then
you
must
get
used
to
it
replied
godfather
arne
could
not
sleep
at
night
because
of
this
fear
and
yearning
were
at
war
within
him
but
whatever
the
result
might
be
he
went
along
and
was
about
the
only
youth
among
all
these
girls
he
could
not
deny
that
he
felt
disappointed
they
were
neither
those
he
had
sung
about
nor
those
he
had
feared
to
meet
there
was
an
excitement
and
merriment
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
known
before
and
the
first
thing
that
struck
him
was
that
they
could
laugh
over
nothing
in
the
world
and
if
three
laughed
why
then
five
laughed
simply
because
those
three
laughed
they
all
acted
as
though
they
were
members
of
the
same
household
and
yet
many
of
them
had
not
met
before
that
day
if
they
caught
the
bough
they
were
jumping
after
they
laughed
at
that
and
if
they
did
not
catch
it
they
laughed
at
that
too
they
fought
for
the
hook
to
draw
it
down
with
those
who
got
it
laughed
and
those
who
did
not
get
it
laughed
also
godfather
hobbled
after
them
with
his
cane
and
offered
all
the
hindrance
in
his
power
those
whom
he
caught
laughed
because
he
caught
them
and
those
whom
he
did
not
catch
laughed
because
he
did
not
catch
them
but
they
all
laughed
at
arne
for
being
sober
and
when
he
tried
to
laugh
they
laughed
because
he
was
laughing
at
last
they
seated
themselves
finally
on
a
large
hill
godfather
in
the
centre
and
all
the
girls
around
him
the
hill
commanded
a
fine
outlook
the
sun
scorched
but
the
girls
heeded
it
not
they
sat
casting
and
shells
at
one
another
giving
the
kernels
to
godfather
he
tried
to
quiet
them
at
last
striking
at
them
with
his
cane
as
far
as
he
could
reach
for
now
he
wanted
them
to
tell
stories
above
all
something
amusing
but
to
get
them
started
seemed
more
difficult
than
to
stop
a
carriage
on
a
godfather
began
himself
there
were
many
who
did
not
want
to
listen
for
they
knew
already
everything
he
had
to
tell
but
they
all
ended
by
listening
attentively
before
they
knew
what
they
were
about
they
sat
in
the
centre
and
each
took
her
turn
in
following
his
example
as
best
she
could
now
arne
was
much
astonished
to
find
that
just
in
proportion
to
the
noise
the
girls
had
made
before
was
the
gravity
of
the
stories
they
now
told
love
was
the
chief
theme
of
these
but
you
aasa
have
a
good
one
i
remember
that
from
last
year
said
godfather
turning
to
a
plump
girl
with
a
round
pleasant
face
who
sat
braiding
the
hair
of
a
younger
sister
whose
head
was
in
her
lap
several
that
are
here
may
know
that
said
she
well
give
it
to
us
anyway
they
begged
i
will
not
have
to
be
urged
long
said
she
and
still
braiding
she
told
and
sang
as
follows
there
was
a
youth
who
tended
cattle
and
he
was
in
the
habit
of
driving
his
herds
upward
along
the
banks
of
a
broad
stream
high
up
on
his
way
there
was
a
crag
which
hung
out
so
far
over
the
stream
that
when
he
stood
on
it
he
could
call
out
to
any
one
on
the
other
side
for
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
there
was
a
whom
he
could
see
all
day
long
but
he
could
not
come
over
to
her
tell
me
thy
name
thou
girl
that
art
sitting
up
there
with
thy
sheep
so
busily
knitting
he
asked
over
and
over
again
for
many
days
until
at
last
one
day
there
came
the
answer
name
floats
about
like
a
duck
in
wet
weather
come
over
thou
boy
in
the
cap
of
brown
leather
but
this
made
the
youth
no
wiser
than
before
and
he
thought
he
would
pay
no
further
heed
to
the
girl
this
was
not
so
easy
though
for
let
him
drive
the
cattle
where
he
would
he
was
always
drawn
back
to
the
crag
then
the
youth
grew
alarmed
and
called
over
who
is
your
father
and
where
are
you
biding
on
the
road
to
the
church
i
have
seen
you
riding
the
youth
more
than
half
believed
her
in
fact
to
be
a
hulder
house
is
burned
down
and
my
father
is
drowned
and
the
road
to
the
i
never
have
found
now
this
also
made
the
youth
no
wiser
than
before
by
day
he
lingered
on
the
crag
and
by
night
he
dreamed
that
she
was
dancing
around
him
and
gave
him
a
lash
with
a
great
each
time
he
tried
to
take
hold
of
her
soon
he
could
not
sleep
at
all
neither
could
he
work
and
the
poor
youth
was
in
a
wretched
state
again
he
called
aloud
thou
art
a
hulder
then
pray
do
not
spell
me
if
thou
art
a
maiden
then
hasten
to
tell
me
but
there
came
no
answer
and
then
he
was
sure
that
this
was
a
hulder
he
gave
up
tending
cattle
but
it
was
just
as
bad
for
wherever
he
went
or
whatever
he
did
he
thought
of
the
fair
hulder
who
blew
on
the
horn
then
one
day
as
he
stood
chopping
wood
there
came
a
girl
through
the
yard
who
actually
looked
like
the
hulder
but
when
she
came
nearer
it
was
not
she
he
thought
much
about
this
then
the
girl
came
back
and
in
the
distance
it
was
the
hulder
and
he
ran
directly
toward
her
but
the
moment
he
came
near
her
it
was
not
she
after
this
let
the
youth
be
at
church
at
a
dance
at
other
social
gatherings
or
where
he
would
the
girl
was
there
too
when
he
was
far
from
her
she
seemed
to
be
the
hulder
near
to
her
she
seemed
to
be
another
he
asked
her
then
whether
it
were
she
or
not
but
she
laughed
at
him
it
is
just
as
well
to
spring
into
it
as
to
creep
into
it
thought
the
youth
and
so
he
married
the
girl
no
sooner
was
this
done
than
the
youth
ceased
to
like
the
girl
away
from
her
he
longed
for
her
but
when
with
her
he
longed
for
one
he
did
not
see
therefore
he
was
harsh
toward
his
wife
she
bore
this
and
was
silent
but
one
day
when
he
was
searching
for
the
horses
he
found
his
way
to
the
crag
and
sitting
down
he
called
out
fairy
moonlight
to
me
thou
seemest
like
midsummer
fires
from
afar
thou
gleamest
he
thought
it
did
him
good
to
sit
there
and
he
fell
into
the
way
of
going
thither
whenever
anything
went
amiss
at
home
the
wife
wept
when
she
was
left
alone
but
one
day
while
the
youth
was
sitting
on
the
crag
the
hulder
her
living
self
appeared
on
the
opposite
side
and
blew
her
horn
he
eagerly
cried
dear
art
thou
come
all
around
thee
is
shining
ah
blow
now
again
i
am
sitting
here
pining
then
she
answered
from
thy
mind
the
dreams
i
am
blowing
the
rye
is
all
rotting
for
want
of
mowing
but
the
youth
was
frightened
and
went
home
again
before
long
though
he
was
so
tired
of
his
wife
that
he
felt
compelled
to
wander
off
to
the
wood
and
take
his
seat
on
the
crag
then
a
voice
sang
dreamed
thou
wast
here
ho
hasten
to
bind
me
no
not
over
there
but
behind
you
will
find
me
the
youth
started
up
looked
about
him
and
espied
a
green
skirt
disappearing
through
the
woods
he
pursued
now
there
was
a
chase
through
the
woods
as
fleet
of
foot
as
the
hulder
was
no
mortal
could
be
he
cast
steel
over
her
again
and
again
she
ran
on
the
same
as
before
by
and
by
she
began
to
grow
tired
the
youth
knew
this
from
her
though
her
form
convinced
him
that
it
was
the
hulder
herself
and
none
other
shall
surely
be
mine
now
thought
the
youth
and
suddenly
flung
his
arms
about
her
with
such
force
that
both
he
and
she
rolled
far
down
the
hill
before
they
could
stop
then
the
hulder
laughed
until
the
youth
thought
the
mountains
fairly
rang
he
took
her
on
his
knee
and
she
looked
so
fair
just
as
he
had
once
thought
his
wife
would
look
dear
who
are
you
that
are
so
fair
asked
the
youth
and
as
he
caressed
her
he
felt
that
her
cheeks
were
warm
and
glowing
good
gracious
i
am
your
wife
said
she
the
girls
laughed
and
thought
the
youth
was
very
foolish
but
godfather
asked
arne
if
he
had
been
listening
well
now
i
will
tell
you
something
said
a
little
girl
with
a
little
round
face
and
such
a
very
little
nose
there
was
a
little
youth
who
wanted
very
much
to
woo
a
little
maiden
they
were
both
grown
up
yet
were
both
very
small
indeed
but
the
youth
could
not
muster
up
courage
enough
to
begin
his
wooing
he
always
joined
her
after
church
but
they
did
not
then
get
beyond
the
weather
in
their
talk
he
sought
her
at
the
dances
and
he
danced
her
almost
to
death
but
talk
with
her
he
could
not
must
learn
to
write
and
then
you
will
not
have
to
said
he
to
himself
and
so
the
youth
took
to
writing
but
he
never
thought
he
could
do
well
enough
and
so
he
wrote
a
whole
year
before
he
dared
think
of
a
letter
then
the
trouble
was
how
to
deliver
it
so
that
no
one
should
see
and
he
waited
until
once
they
chanced
to
meet
alone
behind
the
church
have
a
letter
for
you
said
the
youth
i
can
not
read
writing
answered
the
maiden
and
the
youth
got
no
further
then
he
took
service
at
her
father
house
and
hung
round
her
the
whole
day
long
once
he
came
very
near
speaking
to
her
he
had
already
opened
his
mouth
when
there
flew
into
it
a
large
fly
only
no
one
comes
and
takes
her
from
me
thought
the
youth
but
there
came
no
one
to
take
her
from
him
because
she
was
so
small
some
one
did
come
along
though
at
last
for
he
was
small
too
the
youth
well
knew
what
he
was
after
and
when
he
and
the
girl
went
together
the
youth
made
his
way
to
the
now
he
who
was
within
offered
himself
dunce
that
i
am
not
to
have
made
more
haste
thought
the
youth
he
who
was
inside
kissed
the
girl
right
on
the
lips
must
have
tasted
good
thought
the
youth
but
he
who
was
inside
had
drawn
the
girl
down
on
his
knee
a
world
we
live
in
said
the
youth
and
wept
this
the
girl
heard
and
went
to
the
door
do
you
want
of
me
you
ugly
boy
that
you
never
give
me
any
peace
i
only
wanted
to
ask
you
if
i
might
be
your
groomsman
my
brothers
are
to
be
the
groomsmen
answered
the
girl
and
slammed
the
door
in
his
face
and
the
youth
got
no
further
the
girls
laughed
a
great
deal
at
this
story
and
sent
a
shower
of
husks
flying
round
after
it
godfather
now
wanted
eli
böen
to
tell
something
what
should
it
be
why
she
might
tell
what
she
had
told
over
on
the
hill
when
he
was
with
them
the
time
she
gave
him
the
new
garters
it
was
a
good
while
before
eli
was
ready
for
she
laughed
so
hard
but
at
last
she
told
a
girl
and
a
boy
were
walking
together
on
the
same
road
see
the
thrush
that
is
following
us
said
the
girl
is
i
whom
it
is
following
said
the
boy
is
just
as
likely
to
be
me
answered
the
girl
we
can
soon
see
remarked
the
boy
you
take
the
lower
road
and
i
will
take
the
upper
one
and
we
will
meet
at
the
top
of
the
hill
they
did
so
it
not
following
me
asked
the
boy
when
they
met
it
was
following
me
answered
the
girl
there
must
be
two
they
walked
together
again
a
little
way
but
then
there
was
only
one
thrush
the
boy
thought
it
flew
on
his
side
but
the
girl
thought
it
flew
on
hers
deuce
i
not
bother
my
head
any
more
about
that
thrush
said
the
boy
i
either
replied
the
girl
but
no
sooner
had
they
said
this
than
the
thrush
was
gone
was
on
side
said
the
boy
i
thank
you
i
saw
plainly
it
was
on
but
there
there
it
comes
again
called
out
the
girl
it
is
on
side
cried
the
boy
but
now
the
girl
became
angry
all
the
plagues
take
me
if
i
walk
with
you
any
longer
and
she
went
her
own
way
then
the
thrush
left
the
boy
and
the
way
became
so
tedious
that
he
began
to
call
out
she
answered
the
thrush
with
you
shouted
the
boy
it
is
with
you
dear
you
must
come
here
again
then
perhaps
it
will
come
too
and
the
girl
came
again
they
took
each
other
by
the
hand
and
walked
together
kvit
kvit
kvit
was
heard
on
the
girl
side
kvit
kvit
kvit
was
heard
on
the
boy
side
kvit
kvit
kvit
kvit
kvit
kvit
kvit
was
heard
on
both
sides
and
when
they
came
to
look
there
were
a
thousand
million
thrushes
round
about
them
how
strange
said
the
girl
and
looked
up
at
the
boy
you
said
the
boy
and
caressed
the
girl
this
story
all
the
girls
thought
fine
then
godfather
suggested
that
they
should
tell
what
they
had
dreamed
the
night
before
and
he
would
decide
who
had
had
the
finest
dream
what
tell
their
dreams
no
indeed
and
there
was
no
end
to
the
laughing
and
whispering
but
then
one
after
another
began
to
remark
that
she
had
had
such
a
fine
dream
last
night
others
again
that
fine
as
the
ones
they
had
had
it
could
not
by
any
means
be
and
finally
they
all
were
seized
with
a
desire
to
tell
their
dreams
but
it
must
not
be
out
loud
it
must
only
be
to
and
that
must
by
no
means
be
godfather
arne
was
sitting
quietly
on
the
hill
and
so
he
was
the
one
to
whom
they
dared
tell
their
dreams
arne
took
a
seat
beneath
a
hazel
and
then
she
who
had
told
the
first
story
came
to
him
she
thought
a
long
time
and
then
told
as
follows
i
dreamed
i
stood
by
a
great
lake
then
i
saw
some
one
go
on
the
water
and
it
was
one
whom
i
will
not
name
he
climbed
up
in
a
large
and
sat
and
sang
but
i
went
out
on
one
of
those
large
leaves
that
the
has
and
which
lie
and
float
on
it
i
wanted
to
row
over
to
him
but
no
sooner
had
i
stepped
on
the
leaf
than
it
began
to
sink
with
me
and
i
grew
much
alarmed
and
cried
then
he
came
rowing
over
to
me
in
the
lifted
me
up
to
where
he
sat
and
we
rowed
all
over
the
lake
was
not
that
a
nice
dream
the
little
maiden
who
had
told
the
little
story
now
came
i
dreamed
i
had
caught
a
little
bird
and
i
was
so
happy
that
i
did
not
want
to
let
it
go
until
i
got
home
but
there
i
did
not
dare
let
go
of
it
lest
father
and
mother
should
tell
me
i
must
let
it
out
again
so
i
went
up
in
the
garret
with
it
but
there
the
cat
was
lurking
and
so
i
could
not
let
go
of
it
there
either
then
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
so
i
took
it
up
in
the
but
good
gracious
there
were
so
many
cracks
there
that
it
could
easily
fly
away
well
then
i
went
out
in
the
yard
again
and
there
i
thought
stood
one
whom
i
will
not
name
he
was
playing
with
a
large
black
dog
would
rather
play
with
that
bird
of
yours
said
he
and
came
close
up
to
me
but
i
thought
i
started
to
run
and
he
and
the
large
dog
after
me
and
thus
i
ran
all
round
the
yard
but
then
mother
opened
the
front
door
drew
me
quickly
in
and
slammed
the
door
outside
the
boy
stood
laughing
with
his
face
against
the
here
is
the
bird
said
he
and
just
think
he
really
had
the
bird
was
not
that
a
funny
dream
then
she
came
who
had
told
about
all
the
thrushes
eli
they
had
called
her
it
was
the
eli
he
had
seen
that
evening
in
the
boat
and
in
the
water
she
was
the
same
and
yet
not
the
same
so
and
pretty
she
looked
as
she
sat
there
with
her
delicately
cut
face
and
slender
form
she
laughed
immoderately
and
therefore
it
was
long
before
she
could
control
herself
but
then
she
told
as
follows
i
had
been
feeling
so
glad
that
i
was
coming
to
the
that
i
dreamed
last
night
i
was
sitting
here
on
the
hill
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
i
had
a
whole
lapful
of
nuts
but
then
there
came
a
little
squirrel
right
in
among
the
nuts
and
it
sat
on
its
hind
legs
in
my
lap
and
ate
them
all
up
was
not
that
a
funny
dream
yet
other
dreams
were
told
arne
and
then
he
was
to
decide
which
was
the
finest
he
had
to
take
a
long
time
to
consider
and
meanwhile
godfather
started
off
with
the
whole
crowd
for
the
gard
and
arne
was
to
follow
they
sprang
down
the
hill
formed
in
a
row
when
they
had
reached
the
plain
and
sang
all
the
way
to
the
house
arne
still
sat
there
listening
to
the
singing
the
sun
fell
directly
on
the
group
it
shone
on
their
white
sleeves
soon
they
twined
their
arms
about
each
other
waists
they
went
dancing
across
the
meadow
godfather
after
them
with
his
cane
because
they
were
treading
down
his
grass
arne
thought
no
more
about
the
dreams
soon
he
even
left
off
watching
the
girls
his
thoughts
wandered
far
beyond
the
valley
as
did
the
fine
sunbeams
and
he
sat
alone
there
on
the
hill
and
spun
before
he
was
aware
of
it
he
was
entangled
in
a
close
web
of
melancholy
he
yearned
to
break
away
and
never
in
the
world
before
so
ardently
as
now
he
faithfully
promised
himself
that
when
he
got
home
he
would
talk
with
his
mother
come
of
it
what
would
his
thoughts
grew
stronger
and
drifted
into
the
song
over
the
lofty
mountains
words
had
never
flowed
so
readily
as
now
nor
had
they
ever
blended
so
surely
into
verse
they
almost
seemed
like
girls
sitting
around
on
a
hill
he
had
a
scrap
of
paper
about
him
and
placing
it
on
his
knee
he
wrote
when
the
song
was
complete
he
arose
like
one
who
was
released
felt
that
he
could
not
see
people
and
took
the
forest
road
home
although
he
knew
that
the
night
too
would
be
needed
for
this
the
first
time
he
sat
down
to
rest
on
the
way
he
felt
for
the
song
that
he
might
sing
it
aloud
as
he
went
along
and
let
it
be
borne
all
over
the
parish
but
he
found
he
had
left
it
in
the
place
where
it
was
written
one
of
the
girls
went
up
the
hill
to
look
for
him
did
not
find
him
but
found
his
song
chapter
x
to
talk
with
the
mother
was
more
easily
thought
than
done
arne
alluded
to
kristian
and
the
letter
that
never
came
but
the
mother
went
away
from
him
and
for
whole
days
after
he
thought
her
eyes
looked
red
he
had
also
another
indication
of
her
feelings
and
that
was
that
she
prepared
unusually
good
meals
for
him
he
had
to
go
up
in
the
woods
to
fetch
an
armful
of
fuel
one
day
the
road
led
through
the
forest
and
just
where
he
was
to
do
his
chopping
was
the
place
where
people
went
to
pick
whortleberries
in
the
autumn
he
had
put
down
his
axe
in
order
to
take
off
his
jacket
and
was
just
about
beginning
when
two
girls
came
walking
along
with
berry
pails
it
was
his
wont
to
hide
himself
rather
than
meet
girls
and
so
he
did
now
o
dear
o
dear
what
a
lot
of
berries
eli
eli
yes
dear
i
see
them
well
then
do
not
go
any
farther
here
are
many
pailfuls
i
thought
there
was
a
rustling
in
that
bush
over
there
oh
you
must
be
mad
and
the
girls
rushed
at
each
other
and
put
their
arms
about
each
other
waists
they
stood
for
a
long
while
so
still
that
they
scarcely
breathed
it
is
surely
nothing
let
us
go
on
picking
yes
i
really
think
we
will
and
so
they
began
to
gather
berries
it
was
very
kind
of
you
eli
to
come
over
to
the
parsonage
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
i
have
been
at
godfather
yes
you
told
me
that
but
have
you
nothing
about
you
know
who
oh
yes
oh
oh
eli
is
that
so
make
haste
tell
me
he
has
been
there
again
oh
nonsense
yes
indeed
both
father
and
mother
pretended
they
did
not
see
it
but
i
went
up
in
the
garret
and
hid
more
more
did
he
follow
you
there
i
think
father
told
him
where
i
was
he
is
always
so
provoking
and
so
he
came
sit
down
sit
down
here
beside
me
well
so
he
came
yes
but
he
did
not
say
much
for
he
was
so
bashful
every
word
do
you
hear
every
word
you
afraid
of
me
said
he
should
i
be
afraid
said
i
know
what
it
is
i
want
of
you
said
he
and
sat
down
on
the
chest
beside
me
beside
you
and
then
he
put
his
arm
round
my
waist
his
arm
round
your
waist
are
you
wild
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
him
but
he
would
not
let
me
go
eli
said
he
she
laughed
and
the
other
girl
laughed
too
well
well
you
be
my
wife
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
and
then
both
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
finally
the
laughter
too
had
to
come
to
an
end
and
then
a
long
silence
ensued
after
a
while
the
first
one
asked
but
softly
say
was
it
not
too
bad
that
he
put
his
arm
round
your
waist
either
the
other
one
made
no
reply
to
this
or
else
she
spoke
in
such
a
low
tone
that
it
could
not
be
heard
perhaps
too
she
answered
only
with
a
smile
presently
the
first
one
asked
have
neither
your
father
nor
your
mother
said
anything
since
father
came
up
and
looked
at
me
but
i
kept
hiding
for
he
laughed
every
time
he
saw
me
but
your
mother
why
she
said
nothing
but
she
was
less
harsh
than
usual
well
you
certainly
refused
him
of
course
then
there
was
a
long
silence
again
eli
well
do
you
think
any
one
will
ever
come
that
way
to
me
yes
to
be
sure
how
you
talk
o
h
say
eli
what
if
he
should
put
his
arm
round
my
waist
she
covered
her
face
there
was
much
laughter
afterwards
whispering
and
tittering
the
girls
soon
went
away
they
had
neither
seen
arne
nor
the
axe
and
the
jacket
and
he
was
glad
some
days
later
he
put
upland
knut
in
the
houseman
place
under
kampen
you
shall
no
longer
be
lonely
said
arne
arne
himself
took
to
steady
work
he
had
early
learned
to
cut
with
the
for
he
had
himself
added
much
to
the
house
at
home
now
he
wanted
to
work
at
his
trade
for
he
knew
it
was
well
to
have
some
definite
occupation
it
was
also
good
for
him
to
get
out
among
people
and
so
changed
had
he
gradually
become
that
he
longed
for
this
whenever
he
had
kept
to
himself
for
a
while
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
at
the
parsonage
for
a
time
that
winter
doing
carpentering
and
the
two
girls
were
often
together
there
arne
wondered
when
he
saw
them
who
it
could
be
that
was
now
courting
eli
böen
it
so
happened
one
day
when
they
went
out
for
a
ride
that
arne
had
to
drive
for
the
young
lady
of
the
parsonage
and
eli
he
had
good
ears
yet
could
not
hear
what
they
were
talking
about
sometimes
mathilde
spoke
to
him
at
which
eli
laughed
and
hid
her
face
once
mathilde
asked
if
it
was
true
he
could
make
verses
no
he
said
promptly
then
they
both
laughed
chattered
and
laughed
this
made
him
indignant
and
he
pretended
not
to
see
them
once
he
was
sitting
in
the
servants
hall
when
there
was
dancing
there
mathilde
and
eli
both
came
in
to
look
on
they
were
disputing
about
something
in
the
corner
where
they
stood
eli
would
not
but
mathilde
would
and
she
won
then
they
both
crossed
the
floor
to
him
courtesied
and
asked
whether
he
could
dance
he
answered
no
and
then
they
both
turned
laughed
and
ran
away
they
keep
up
a
perpetual
laughter
thought
arne
and
became
sober
but
the
priest
had
a
little
adopted
son
about
ten
or
twelve
years
old
of
whom
arne
thought
a
good
deal
from
this
boy
arne
learned
to
dance
when
no
one
else
was
present
eli
had
a
little
brother
about
the
same
age
as
the
priest
adopted
son
these
two
were
playmates
and
arne
made
sleds
skees
and
snares
for
them
and
he
often
talked
with
them
about
their
sisters
especially
about
eli
one
day
eli
brother
brought
word
that
arne
should
not
be
so
careless
with
his
hair
who
said
so
eli
said
so
but
i
was
not
to
tell
that
she
said
so
some
days
after
arne
sent
a
message
to
eli
that
she
should
laugh
a
little
less
the
boy
came
back
with
the
reply
that
arne
should
laugh
a
little
more
once
the
boy
asked
for
something
he
had
written
arne
let
him
have
it
and
thought
no
more
of
it
after
a
while
the
boy
thought
he
would
please
arne
with
the
tidings
that
both
the
girls
liked
his
writing
very
much
why
have
they
seen
it
yes
it
was
for
them
i
wanted
it
arne
asked
the
boys
to
bring
him
something
their
sisters
had
written
they
did
so
arne
corrected
the
mistakes
with
a
carpenter
pencil
he
asked
the
boys
to
place
the
paper
where
it
could
easily
be
found
afterwards
he
found
it
again
in
his
jacket
pocket
but
at
the
bottom
was
written
corrected
by
a
conceited
fellow
the
next
day
arne
finished
his
work
at
the
parsonage
and
set
out
for
home
so
gentle
as
he
was
this
winter
his
mother
had
never
seen
him
since
those
sorrowful
days
after
his
father
death
he
read
the
sermon
for
her
went
with
her
to
church
and
was
very
kind
to
her
but
she
well
knew
it
was
all
to
get
her
consent
to
journey
away
from
her
when
spring
came
then
one
day
he
had
a
message
from
böen
to
know
if
he
would
come
there
and
do
some
carpentering
arne
was
quite
startled
and
answered
yes
as
though
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
no
sooner
had
the
messenger
gone
than
the
mother
said
you
may
well
be
astonished
from
böen
is
that
so
strange
asked
arne
but
did
not
look
at
her
as
he
spoke
from
böen
cried
the
mother
once
more
well
why
not
as
well
from
there
as
from
another
gard
arne
now
looked
up
a
little
from
böen
and
birgit
böen
baard
who
gave
your
father
the
blow
that
was
his
ruin
and
that
for
birgit
böen
sake
what
do
you
say
now
cried
the
youth
was
that
baard
böen
son
and
mother
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
between
the
two
a
whole
life
was
unfolded
and
this
was
a
moment
wherein
they
could
see
the
black
thread
which
all
along
had
been
woven
through
it
they
fell
later
to
talking
about
the
father
proud
days
when
old
eli
böen
herself
had
courted
him
for
her
daughter
birgit
and
got
a
refusal
they
went
through
his
whole
life
just
as
far
as
where
he
was
knocked
down
and
both
found
out
that
baard
fault
had
been
the
least
nevertheless
it
was
he
who
had
given
the
father
that
fatal
blow
he
it
was
am
i
not
yet
done
with
father
then
thought
arne
and
decided
at
the
same
moment
to
go
when
arne
came
walking
with
the
on
his
shoulder
over
the
ice
and
up
toward
böen
it
seemed
to
him
a
pretty
gard
the
house
always
looked
as
though
it
were
newly
painted
he
was
a
little
chilled
and
that
was
perhaps
why
it
seemed
so
cozy
to
him
he
did
not
go
directly
in
but
went
beyond
toward
the
stable
where
a
flock
of
shaggy
goats
were
standing
in
the
snow
gnawing
at
the
bark
of
some
fir
branches
a
shepherd
dog
walked
to
and
fro
on
the
and
barked
as
though
the
devil
himself
was
coming
to
the
gard
but
the
moment
arne
stood
still
he
wagged
his
tail
and
let
him
pat
him
the
kitchen
door
on
the
farther
side
of
the
house
was
often
opened
and
arne
looked
down
there
each
time
but
it
was
either
the
with
tubs
and
pails
or
the
cook
who
was
throwing
something
out
to
the
goats
inside
the
barn
they
were
threshing
with
frequent
strokes
and
to
the
left
in
front
of
the
stood
a
boy
chopping
wood
behind
him
there
were
many
layers
of
wood
piled
up
arne
put
down
his
saw
and
went
into
the
kitchen
there
white
sand
was
spread
on
the
floor
and
finely
cut
juniper
leaves
strewed
over
it
on
the
walls
glittered
copper
kettles
and
crockery
stood
in
rows
they
were
cooking
dinner
arne
asked
to
speak
with
baard
go
into
the
some
one
said
pointing
to
the
door
he
went
there
was
no
latch
to
the
door
but
a
brass
handle
it
was
cheerful
in
there
and
brightly
painted
the
ceiling
was
decorated
with
many
roses
the
cupboards
were
red
with
the
owner
name
in
black
the
was
also
red
but
bordered
with
blue
stripes
by
the
stove
sat
a
man
with
a
mild
face
and
long
yellow
hair
he
was
putting
hoops
about
some
pails
by
the
long
table
sat
a
tall
slender
woman
with
a
high
linen
cap
on
her
head
and
dressed
in
clothes
she
was
sorting
corn
into
two
heaps
besides
these
there
were
no
others
in
the
room
good
day
and
bless
the
work
said
arne
drawing
off
his
hat
both
looked
up
the
man
smiled
and
asked
who
it
was
it
is
he
who
is
to
do
carpentering
the
man
smiled
more
and
said
as
he
nodded
his
head
and
began
his
work
again
well
then
it
is
arne
kampen
arne
kampen
cried
the
wife
and
stared
fixedly
before
her
the
man
looked
up
hastily
and
smiled
again
the
son
of
tailor
nils
he
said
and
went
on
once
more
with
his
work
after
a
while
the
wife
got
up
crossed
the
floor
to
the
shelf
turned
went
to
the
cupboard
turned
again
and
as
she
at
last
was
rummaging
in
a
table
drawer
she
asked
without
looking
up
is
to
work
yes
that
he
is
said
the
man
also
without
looking
up
it
seems
no
one
has
asked
you
to
sit
down
he
observed
addressing
himself
to
arne
the
latter
took
a
seat
the
wife
left
the
room
the
man
continued
to
work
and
so
arne
asked
if
he
too
should
begin
let
us
first
have
dinner
the
wife
did
not
come
in
again
but
the
next
time
the
opened
it
was
eli
who
came
she
appeared
at
first
not
to
notice
arne
when
he
rose
to
go
to
her
she
stood
still
and
half
turned
to
give
him
her
hand
but
she
did
not
look
at
him
they
exchanged
a
few
words
the
father
worked
on
eli
had
her
hair
braided
wore
a
dress
was
slender
and
straight
had
round
wrists
and
small
hands
she
laid
the
table
the
dined
in
the
next
room
but
arne
with
the
family
in
this
one
it
so
happened
that
they
had
their
meals
separately
usually
they
all
ate
at
the
same
table
in
the
large
light
kitchen
is
not
mother
coming
asked
the
man
no
she
is
weighing
wool
have
you
asked
her
yes
but
she
says
she
does
not
want
anything
there
was
silence
for
a
while
but
it
is
cold
she
did
not
want
me
to
make
a
fire
after
dinner
arne
began
work
in
the
evening
he
was
again
with
the
family
in
the
then
the
wife
too
was
there
the
women
were
sewing
the
husband
was
busy
with
some
trifles
and
arne
helped
him
there
was
a
prolonged
silence
for
eli
who
usually
led
in
conversation
was
also
silent
arne
thought
with
dismay
that
it
probably
was
often
thus
at
his
own
home
but
he
realized
it
now
for
the
first
time
eli
drew
a
long
breath
at
last
as
though
she
had
restrained
herself
long
enough
and
then
she
fell
to
laughing
then
the
father
also
laughed
and
arne
too
thought
it
was
laughable
and
joined
in
from
this
time
forth
they
talked
of
various
things
but
it
ended
in
arne
and
eli
doing
most
of
the
talking
the
father
putting
in
an
occasional
word
but
once
when
arne
had
been
speaking
for
some
time
and
happened
to
look
up
he
met
the
eyes
of
the
mother
birgit
she
had
dropped
her
sewing
and
sat
staring
fixedly
at
him
now
she
picked
up
her
work
again
but
at
the
first
word
he
spoke
she
raised
her
eyes
came
and
each
one
went
his
way
arne
thought
he
would
notice
the
dream
he
had
the
first
night
in
a
new
place
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
sense
in
it
the
whole
day
long
he
had
talked
little
or
none
with
the
master
of
the
gard
but
at
night
it
was
of
him
he
dreamed
the
last
thing
was
that
baard
sat
playing
cards
with
tailor
nils
the
latter
was
very
angry
and
pale
in
the
face
but
baard
smiled
and
won
the
game
arne
remained
several
days
during
which
time
there
was
scarcely
any
talking
but
a
great
deal
of
work
not
only
those
in
the
family
room
were
silent
but
the
servants
the
tenants
even
the
women
there
was
an
old
dog
on
the
gard
that
barked
every
time
strangers
came
but
the
gard
people
never
heard
the
dog
without
saying
hush
and
then
he
went
growling
off
and
laid
down
again
at
home
at
kampen
there
was
a
large
on
the
house
which
turned
with
the
wind
there
was
a
still
larger
vane
here
to
which
arne
attention
was
attracted
because
it
did
not
turn
when
there
was
a
strong
current
of
wind
the
vane
struggled
to
get
loose
and
arne
looked
at
it
until
he
felt
compelled
to
go
up
on
the
roof
and
set
the
vane
free
it
was
not
frozen
fast
as
he
had
supposed
but
a
pin
was
stuck
through
it
that
it
might
be
kept
still
this
arne
took
out
and
threw
down
the
pin
struck
baard
who
came
walking
along
he
glanced
up
what
are
you
doing
there
i
am
letting
loose
the
vane
do
not
do
so
it
makes
such
a
wailing
noise
when
it
is
in
motion
arne
sat
astride
the
gable
that
is
better
than
always
being
quiet
baard
looked
up
at
arne
and
arne
looked
down
on
baard
then
baard
smiled
he
who
has
to
howl
when
he
talks
had
much
better
keep
silent
i
am
sure
now
it
often
happens
that
words
haunt
us
long
after
they
were
uttered
especially
when
they
were
the
last
ones
heard
so
these
words
haunted
arne
when
he
crept
down
in
the
cold
from
the
roof
and
were
still
with
him
in
the
evening
when
he
entered
the
family
room
eli
was
standing
in
the
twilight
by
a
window
gazing
out
over
the
ice
which
lay
glittering
beneath
the
moon
beams
arne
went
to
the
other
window
and
looked
out
as
she
was
doing
within
all
was
cozy
and
quiet
without
it
was
cold
a
sharp
wind
swept
across
the
valley
so
shaking
the
trees
that
the
shadows
they
cast
in
the
moonlight
did
not
lie
still
but
went
groping
about
in
the
snow
from
the
parsonage
there
glimmered
a
light
opening
out
and
closing
in
assuming
many
shapes
and
colors
as
light
is
apt
to
do
when
one
gazes
at
it
too
long
the
mountain
loomed
up
beyond
dark
and
gloomy
with
romance
in
its
depths
and
moonshine
on
its
upper
banks
of
snow
the
sky
was
aglow
with
stars
and
a
little
flickering
northern
light
appeared
in
one
quarter
of
the
horizon
but
did
not
spread
a
short
distance
from
the
window
down
toward
the
lake
there
were
some
trees
whose
shadows
kept
prowling
from
one
to
the
other
but
the
great
ash
stood
alone
writing
on
the
snow
the
night
was
very
still
only
now
and
then
something
shrieked
and
howled
with
a
long
wailing
cry
what
is
that
asked
arne
it
is
the
said
eli
and
afterwards
she
continued
more
softly
as
though
to
herself
it
must
have
been
let
loose
but
arne
had
been
feeling
like
one
who
wanted
to
speak
and
could
not
now
he
said
do
you
remember
the
story
about
the
thrushes
that
sang
yes
why
to
be
sure
it
was
you
who
told
that
one
it
was
a
pretty
story
she
said
in
so
gentle
a
voice
that
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
the
first
time
he
heard
it
i
often
think
there
is
something
that
sings
when
it
is
quite
still
that
is
the
good
within
ourselves
she
looked
at
him
as
though
there
were
something
too
much
in
that
answer
they
were
both
quiet
afterward
then
she
asked
as
she
traced
figures
with
one
finger
on
the
have
you
made
any
songs
lately
he
blushed
but
this
she
did
not
see
therefore
she
asked
again
how
do
you
manage
when
you
make
songs
would
you
really
like
to
know
oh
yes
i
hoard
up
the
thoughts
that
others
are
in
the
habit
of
letting
go
he
answered
evasively
she
was
long
silent
for
she
had
doubtless
been
making
an
attempt
at
a
song
or
two
what
if
she
had
had
those
thoughts
and
let
them
go
that
is
strange
said
she
as
though
to
herself
and
fell
to
tracing
figures
on
the
pane
again
i
made
a
song
after
i
had
seen
you
the
first
time
where
was
that
over
by
the
parsonage
the
evening
you
left
there
i
saw
you
in
the
lake
she
laughed
then
was
still
a
while
let
me
hear
that
song
arne
had
never
before
done
such
a
thing
but
now
he
sang
for
her
the
song
fair
venevill
bounded
on
lithesome
feet
her
lover
to
meet
etc
eli
stood
there
very
attentive
she
stood
there
long
after
he
was
through
at
last
she
burst
out
oh
how
i
pity
her
it
seems
as
though
i
had
not
made
it
myself
said
arne
for
he
felt
ashamed
at
having
produced
it
nor
did
he
understand
how
he
had
come
to
do
so
he
remained
standing
there
as
if
looking
after
the
song
then
she
said
but
i
hope
it
will
not
be
that
way
with
me
no
no
no
i
was
only
thinking
of
myself
is
that
to
be
your
fate
then
i
do
not
know
but
i
felt
so
at
that
time
indeed
i
do
not
understand
it
now
but
i
once
had
such
a
heavy
heart
that
was
strange
she
began
to
write
on
the
again
the
next
day
when
arne
came
in
to
dinner
he
went
over
to
the
window
outside
it
was
gray
and
foggy
within
warm
and
pleasant
but
on
the
a
finger
had
traced
arne
arne
arne
and
over
again
arne
it
was
the
window
where
eli
had
stood
the
preceding
evening
but
eli
did
not
come
that
day
she
was
feeling
she
had
not
been
well
at
all
of
late
she
had
said
so
herself
and
it
was
plainly
to
be
seen
chapter
xi
a
day
later
arne
came
in
and
announced
that
he
had
just
heard
on
the
gard
that
the
priest
daughter
mathilde
had
that
very
moment
started
for
the
town
as
she
thought
for
a
few
days
but
as
had
been
decided
to
stay
there
for
a
year
or
two
eli
had
heard
nothing
of
this
before
and
fell
fainting
it
was
the
first
time
arne
had
seen
any
one
faint
and
he
was
much
alarmed
he
ran
for
the
they
went
for
the
parents
who
started
at
once
there
was
confusion
all
over
the
gard
even
the
barked
on
the
when
arne
came
in
again
later
the
mother
was
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
the
father
stood
holding
the
sick
girl
head
the
were
running
one
for
water
another
for
medicine
which
was
kept
in
a
cupboard
a
third
was
unfastening
eli
jacket
at
the
throat
the
lord
help
and
bless
us
cried
the
mother
it
was
certainly
wrong
that
we
said
nothing
to
her
it
was
you
baard
who
would
have
it
so
the
lord
help
and
bless
us
baard
made
no
reply
i
said
we
had
better
tell
her
but
nothing
is
ever
done
as
i
wish
the
lord
help
and
bless
us
you
are
always
so
underhand
with
her
baard
you
do
not
understand
her
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
care
for
any
one
baard
still
made
no
reply
she
is
not
like
others
they
can
bear
sorrow
but
it
completely
upsets
her
poor
thing
she
is
so
slight
and
especially
now
when
she
is
not
well
at
all
wake
up
again
my
dear
child
and
we
will
be
kind
to
you
wake
up
again
eli
my
own
dear
child
and
do
not
grieve
us
so
then
baard
said
you
are
either
too
silent
or
you
talk
too
much
and
he
looked
over
at
arne
as
though
he
did
not
wish
him
to
hear
all
this
but
to
go
away
as
the
remained
in
the
room
however
arne
thought
that
he
might
stay
too
but
he
walked
to
the
window
now
the
patient
rallied
so
far
that
she
could
look
about
her
and
recognize
people
but
at
the
same
moment
her
memory
returned
she
shrieked
mathilde
burst
into
hysterical
weeping
and
sobbed
until
it
was
painful
to
be
in
the
room
with
her
the
mother
tried
to
comfort
her
the
father
had
placed
himself
where
he
might
be
seen
but
the
sick
girl
waved
her
hand
to
them
go
away
she
cried
i
do
not
love
you
good
gracious
you
do
not
love
your
parents
said
the
mother
no
you
are
cruel
to
me
and
take
from
me
the
only
joy
i
have
eli
eli
do
not
speak
such
dreadful
words
begged
the
mother
yes
mother
she
shrieked
now
i
must
say
it
yes
mother
you
want
me
to
marry
that
hateful
man
and
i
will
not
you
shut
me
up
here
where
i
am
never
happy
except
when
i
am
to
go
out
you
take
mathilde
from
me
the
only
person
i
love
and
long
for
in
the
world
o
god
what
will
become
of
me
when
mathilde
is
no
longer
here
especially
now
that
i
have
so
much
so
much
i
can
not
manage
when
i
have
no
one
to
talk
with
but
you
really
have
so
seldom
been
with
her
lately
said
baard
what
did
that
matter
when
i
had
her
over
at
the
window
yonder
answered
the
sick
girl
and
she
cried
in
such
a
way
that
it
seemed
to
arne
as
though
he
had
never
before
seen
anything
like
it
but
you
could
not
see
her
there
said
baard
i
could
see
the
gard
answered
she
and
the
mother
added
hotly
you
do
not
understand
such
things
at
all
then
baard
said
no
more
now
i
can
never
go
to
the
window
said
eli
i
went
there
in
the
morning
when
i
got
up
in
the
evening
i
sat
there
in
the
moonlight
and
i
went
there
when
i
had
no
one
else
to
go
to
mathilde
mathilde
she
writhed
in
the
bed
and
again
gave
way
to
hysterical
weeping
baard
sat
down
on
a
stool
near
by
and
watched
her
but
eli
did
not
get
over
this
as
soon
as
her
parents
may
have
expected
toward
evening
they
first
saw
that
she
was
likely
to
have
a
protracted
illness
the
seeds
of
which
had
doubtless
been
gathering
for
some
time
and
arne
was
called
in
to
assist
in
carrying
her
up
to
her
own
room
she
was
unconscious
and
lay
very
pale
and
still
the
mother
sat
down
beside
her
the
father
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
looked
on
afterwards
he
went
down
to
his
work
arne
did
the
same
but
that
night
when
he
went
to
bed
he
prayed
for
her
prayed
that
she
young
and
fair
as
she
was
might
have
a
happy
life
and
that
no
one
might
shut
out
joy
from
her
the
following
day
the
father
and
mother
sat
talking
together
when
arne
came
in
the
mother
had
been
shedding
tears
arne
asked
how
things
were
going
each
waited
for
the
other
to
speak
and
therefore
it
was
long
before
he
got
a
reply
but
finally
the
father
said
it
looks
pretty
bad
later
arne
heard
that
eli
had
been
delirious
the
whole
night
or
as
the
father
said
had
been
raving
now
she
lay
violently
ill
knew
no
one
would
not
take
any
food
and
the
parents
were
just
sitting
there
deliberating
whether
they
should
call
in
the
doctor
when
later
they
went
to
the
sick
girl
and
arne
was
left
alone
again
he
felt
as
though
life
and
death
were
both
up
there
but
he
sat
outside
in
a
few
days
though
she
was
better
once
when
the
father
was
keeping
watch
she
took
a
fancy
to
have
narrifas
the
bird
which
mathilde
had
given
her
standing
beside
the
bed
then
baard
told
her
the
truth
that
in
all
this
confusion
the
bird
had
been
forgotten
and
that
it
was
dead
the
mother
came
just
while
baard
was
telling
this
and
she
burst
out
in
the
door
good
gracious
me
how
heedless
you
are
baard
to
tell
such
things
to
that
sick
child
see
now
she
is
fainting
away
again
heaven
forgive
you
for
what
you
have
done
every
time
the
patient
revived
she
screamed
for
the
bird
said
that
it
would
never
go
well
with
mathilde
since
narrifas
was
dead
wanted
to
go
to
her
and
fell
into
a
swoon
again
baard
stood
there
and
looked
on
until
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
then
he
wanted
to
help
wait
on
her
too
but
the
mother
pushed
him
away
saying
that
she
would
take
care
of
the
sick
girl
alone
then
baard
gazed
at
both
of
them
a
long
while
after
which
he
put
on
his
cap
with
both
hands
turned
and
went
out
the
priest
and
his
wife
came
over
later
for
the
illness
had
taken
fresh
hold
on
eli
and
had
become
so
bad
that
they
knew
not
whether
it
was
tending
to
life
or
death
both
the
priest
and
the
priest
wife
reasoned
with
baard
and
urged
that
he
was
too
harsh
with
eli
they
had
heard
about
the
bird
and
the
priest
told
him
bluntly
that
such
conduct
was
rough
he
would
take
the
child
home
to
the
parsonage
he
said
as
soon
as
she
had
improved
enough
to
be
moved
the
priest
wife
finally
would
not
even
see
baard
she
wept
and
sat
with
the
sick
girl
sent
for
the
doctor
took
his
orders
herself
and
came
over
several
times
each
day
to
carry
them
out
baard
went
wandering
about
from
place
to
place
in
the
yard
going
chiefly
where
he
could
be
alone
he
would
often
stand
still
for
a
long
time
then
straighten
his
cap
with
both
hands
and
find
something
to
do
the
mother
did
not
speak
to
him
any
more
they
scarcely
looked
at
each
other
baard
went
up
to
the
sick
girl
room
several
times
each
day
he
took
off
his
shoes
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
laid
down
his
hat
outside
of
the
door
which
he
opened
cautiously
the
moment
he
came
in
birgit
would
turn
as
though
she
had
not
seen
him
and
then
sit
as
before
with
her
head
in
her
hand
looking
straight
before
her
and
at
the
sick
girl
the
latter
lay
still
and
pale
unconscious
of
anything
about
her
baard
would
stand
a
while
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
look
at
them
both
and
say
nothing
once
when
eli
moved
as
though
about
to
awaken
he
stole
away
directly
as
softly
as
he
had
come
arne
often
thought
that
words
had
now
been
exchanged
between
husband
and
wife
and
parents
and
child
which
had
been
long
brewing
and
which
would
not
soon
be
forgotten
he
longed
to
get
away
although
he
would
have
liked
first
to
know
how
eli
illness
would
end
but
this
he
could
learn
even
if
he
left
he
thought
he
went
therefore
to
baard
and
said
that
he
wished
to
go
home
the
work
for
which
he
had
come
was
done
baard
sat
outside
on
the
when
arne
came
to
tell
him
this
he
sat
digging
in
the
snow
with
a
pin
arne
knew
the
pin
for
it
was
the
same
that
had
fastened
the
weather
vane
without
looking
up
baard
said
i
suppose
it
is
not
pleasant
to
be
here
now
but
i
feel
as
if
i
did
not
want
you
to
leave
baard
said
no
more
nor
did
arne
speak
he
stood
a
while
then
went
away
and
busied
himself
with
some
work
as
though
it
were
decided
that
he
should
remain
later
when
arne
was
called
in
to
dinner
baard
still
sat
on
the
arne
went
over
to
him
and
asked
how
eli
was
getting
on
i
think
she
must
be
pretty
bad
said
baard
i
see
that
mother
is
crying
arne
felt
as
though
some
one
had
bidden
him
to
sit
down
and
he
sat
down
directly
opposite
baard
on
the
end
of
a
fallen
tree
i
have
been
thinking
of
your
father
these
days
said
baard
so
unexpectedly
that
arne
could
make
no
reply
you
know
i
dare
say
what
there
was
between
us
two
yes
i
know
ah
well
you
only
know
half
as
might
have
been
expected
and
naturally
lay
the
greatest
blame
on
me
arne
answered
presently
you
have
doubtless
settled
that
matter
with
your
god
as
my
father
has
surely
done
ah
well
that
may
be
as
one
takes
it
answered
baard
when
i
found
this
pin
again
it
seemed
so
strange
to
me
that
you
should
come
here
and
loosen
the
vane
just
as
well
first
as
last
thought
i
he
had
taken
off
his
cap
and
sat
looking
into
it
arne
did
not
yet
understand
that
by
this
baard
meant
that
he
now
wanted
to
talk
with
him
about
his
father
indeed
he
still
did
not
understand
it
even
after
baard
was
well
under
way
so
little
was
this
like
the
man
but
what
had
been
working
before
in
his
mind
he
gradually
comprehended
as
the
story
advanced
and
if
he
had
hitherto
had
respect
for
this
blundering
but
thoroughly
good
man
it
was
not
lessened
now
i
might
have
been
about
fourteen
years
old
said
baard
then
paused
as
he
did
from
time
to
time
throughout
his
whole
story
said
a
few
words
more
and
paused
again
in
such
a
manner
that
his
story
bore
the
strong
impress
of
having
every
word
weighed
i
might
have
been
about
fourteen
years
old
when
i
became
acquainted
with
your
father
who
was
of
the
same
age
he
was
very
wild
and
could
not
bear
to
have
any
one
above
him
and
what
he
never
could
forgive
me
was
that
i
was
the
head
of
the
class
when
we
were
confirmed
and
he
was
number
two
he
often
offered
to
wrestle
with
me
but
nothing
ever
came
of
it
i
suppose
because
we
were
neither
of
us
sure
of
ourselves
but
it
is
strange
that
he
fought
every
day
and
no
misfortune
befell
him
the
one
time
i
tried
my
hand
it
turned
out
as
badly
as
could
be
but
to
be
sure
i
had
waited
a
long
time
too
nils
fluttered
about
all
the
girls
and
they
about
him
there
was
only
one
i
wanted
but
he
took
her
from
me
at
every
dance
at
every
wedding
at
every
party
it
was
the
one
to
whom
i
am
now
married
i
often
had
a
desire
as
i
sat
looking
on
to
make
a
trial
of
strength
with
him
just
because
of
this
matter
but
i
was
afraid
i
might
lose
and
i
knew
that
if
i
did
so
i
should
lose
her
too
when
the
others
had
gone
i
would
lift
the
weights
he
had
lifted
kick
the
beam
he
had
kicked
but
the
next
time
he
danced
away
from
me
with
the
girl
i
did
not
dare
tackle
him
although
it
chanced
once
as
nils
stood
joking
with
her
right
before
my
face
that
i
laid
hold
of
a
good
sized
fellow
who
stood
by
and
tossed
him
against
the
beam
as
though
for
sport
nils
grew
pale
too
that
time
if
he
had
only
been
kind
to
the
girl
but
he
was
false
to
her
and
that
evening
after
evening
i
almost
think
she
cared
more
for
him
each
time
then
it
was
that
the
last
thing
happened
i
thought
now
it
must
either
break
or
bear
nor
did
the
lord
want
him
to
go
about
any
longer
and
therefore
he
fell
a
little
more
heavily
than
i
had
intended
i
never
saw
him
after
that
they
sat
for
a
long
time
silent
finally
baard
continued
i
offered
myself
again
she
answered
neither
yes
nor
no
and
so
i
thought
she
would
like
me
better
afterwards
we
were
married
the
wedding
took
place
down
in
the
valley
at
the
house
of
her
sister
who
left
her
property
to
her
we
began
with
plenty
and
what
we
then
had
has
increased
our
gards
lay
alongside
of
each
other
and
they
have
since
been
thrown
into
one
as
had
been
my
idea
from
boyhood
up
but
many
other
things
did
not
turn
out
as
i
had
planned
he
was
long
silent
arne
thought
for
a
while
he
was
weeping
it
was
not
so
but
he
spoke
in
a
still
gentler
tone
than
usual
when
he
began
again
at
first
she
was
quiet
and
very
sorrowful
i
had
nothing
to
say
for
her
comfort
and
so
i
was
silent
later
she
fell
at
times
into
that
commanding
way
that
you
have
perhaps
noticed
in
her
yet
it
was
after
all
a
change
and
so
i
was
silent
then
too
but
a
truly
happy
day
i
have
not
had
since
i
was
married
and
that
has
been
now
for
twenty
years
he
broke
the
pin
in
two
then
he
sat
a
while
looking
at
the
pieces
when
eli
grew
to
be
a
large
girl
i
thought
she
would
find
more
happiness
among
strangers
than
here
it
is
seldom
that
i
have
insisted
on
anything
it
usually
has
been
wrong
too
when
i
have
and
so
it
was
with
this
the
mother
yearned
for
her
child
although
only
the
lake
parted
them
and
at
last
i
found
out
that
eli
was
not
under
the
best
influences
over
at
the
parsonage
for
there
is
really
much
nonsense
about
the
priest
family
but
i
found
it
out
too
late
now
she
seems
to
care
for
neither
father
nor
mother
he
had
taken
his
cap
off
again
now
his
long
hair
fell
over
his
eyes
he
stroked
it
aside
and
put
on
his
cap
with
both
hands
as
though
about
to
go
but
as
in
getting
up
he
turned
toward
the
house
he
stopped
and
added
with
a
glance
at
the
chamber
window
i
thought
it
was
best
she
and
mathilde
should
not
bid
each
other
but
that
proved
to
be
wrong
i
told
her
the
little
bird
was
dead
for
it
was
my
fault
you
know
and
it
seemed
to
me
right
to
confess
but
that
was
wrong
too
and
so
it
is
with
everything
i
have
always
meant
to
do
the
best
but
it
has
turned
out
to
be
the
worst
and
now
it
has
gone
so
far
that
they
speak
ill
of
me
both
wife
and
daughter
and
i
am
alone
here
a
girl
now
called
out
to
them
that
dinner
was
getting
cold
baard
got
up
i
hear
the
horses
neighing
said
he
somebody
must
have
forgotten
them
and
with
this
he
went
over
to
the
stable
to
give
them
hay
chapter
xii
eli
was
very
weak
after
her
illness
the
mother
sat
over
her
night
and
day
and
was
never
the
father
made
his
usual
visits
up
to
the
in
his
stocking
feet
and
leaving
his
cap
outside
of
the
door
arne
was
still
at
the
gard
he
and
the
father
sat
together
of
evenings
he
had
come
to
think
a
good
deal
of
baard
who
was
a
man
a
deep
thinker
but
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
what
he
knew
arne
helped
him
to
get
things
right
in
his
mind
and
told
him
much
that
he
did
not
know
before
and
baard
was
very
grateful
eli
could
now
sit
up
at
intervals
and
as
she
began
to
improve
she
took
many
fancies
into
her
head
thus
it
was
that
one
evening
as
arne
sat
in
the
room
below
eli
chamber
singing
songs
in
a
loud
voice
the
mother
came
down
and
brought
word
that
eli
wanted
to
know
if
he
would
not
come
and
sing
that
she
might
hear
the
words
arne
had
undoubtedly
been
singing
for
eli
all
along
for
when
her
mother
gave
him
the
message
he
grew
red
and
rose
as
though
he
would
deny
what
he
had
been
doing
although
no
one
had
charged
him
with
it
he
soon
recovered
his
composure
and
said
evasively
that
there
was
very
little
he
could
sing
but
the
mother
remarked
that
it
did
not
seem
so
when
he
was
alone
arne
yielded
and
went
he
had
not
seen
eli
since
the
day
he
had
helped
carry
her
he
felt
that
she
must
now
be
greatly
changed
and
was
almost
afraid
to
see
her
but
when
he
softly
opened
the
door
and
entered
it
was
so
dark
in
the
room
that
he
saw
no
one
he
paused
on
the
threshold
who
is
it
asked
eli
in
a
clear
low
voice
it
is
arne
kampen
he
answered
in
a
guarded
tone
that
the
words
might
fall
softly
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
how
are
you
now
eli
thank
you
i
am
better
please
sit
down
arne
said
she
presently
and
arne
felt
his
way
to
a
chair
that
stood
by
the
foot
of
the
bed
it
was
so
nice
to
hear
you
singing
you
must
sing
a
little
for
me
up
here
if
i
only
knew
anything
that
was
suitable
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
she
said
sing
a
hymn
and
he
did
so
it
was
a
part
of
one
of
the
confirmation
hymns
when
he
had
finished
he
heard
that
she
was
weeping
and
so
he
dared
not
sing
any
more
but
presently
she
said
sing
another
one
like
that
and
he
sang
another
choosing
the
one
usually
sung
when
the
candidates
for
confirmation
are
standing
in
the
church
aisle
how
many
things
i
have
thought
of
while
i
have
been
lying
here
said
eli
he
did
not
know
what
to
answer
and
he
heard
her
weeping
quietly
in
the
dark
a
clock
was
ticking
on
the
wall
it
gave
warning
that
it
was
about
to
strike
and
then
struck
eli
drew
a
long
breath
several
times
as
though
she
would
ease
her
breast
and
then
she
said
one
knows
so
little
i
have
known
neither
father
nor
mother
i
have
not
been
kind
to
them
and
that
is
why
it
gives
me
such
strange
feelings
to
hear
that
confirmation
hymn
when
people
talk
in
the
dark
they
are
always
more
truthful
than
when
they
see
each
other
face
to
face
they
can
say
more
too
it
is
good
to
hear
your
words
replied
arne
he
was
thinking
of
what
she
had
said
when
she
was
taken
she
knew
what
he
meant
and
so
she
remarked
had
not
this
happened
to
me
god
only
knows
how
long
it
might
have
been
before
i
had
found
my
mother
she
has
been
talking
with
you
now
every
day
she
has
done
nothing
else
then
i
dare
say
you
have
heard
many
things
you
may
well
say
so
i
suppose
she
talked
about
my
father
yes
does
she
still
think
of
him
she
does
he
was
not
kind
to
her
poor
mother
he
was
worst
of
all
though
to
himself
thoughts
now
arose
that
neither
liked
to
express
to
the
other
eli
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
they
say
you
are
like
your
father
so
i
have
heard
he
answered
evasively
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
tone
of
his
voice
and
so
after
a
while
she
continued
could
he
too
make
songs
no
sing
a
song
for
me
one
you
have
made
yourself
but
arne
was
not
in
the
habit
of
confessing
that
the
songs
he
sang
were
his
own
i
have
none
said
he
indeed
you
have
and
i
am
sure
you
will
sing
them
for
me
if
i
ask
it
what
he
had
never
done
for
others
he
now
did
for
her
he
sang
the
following
song
the
tree
early
were
bursting
their
brown
i
take
them
away
said
the
frost
sweeping
down
dear
leave
them
alone
till
blossoms
here
have
grown
prayed
the
tree
while
it
trembled
from
rootlet
to
crown
the
tree
bore
its
blossoms
and
all
the
birds
sung
i
take
them
away
said
the
wind
as
it
swung
dear
leave
them
alone
till
berries
here
have
grown
said
the
tree
while
its
leaflets
all
quivering
hung
the
tree
bore
its
fruit
in
the
midsummer
glow
said
the
girl
i
gather
thy
berries
or
no
dear
all
thou
canst
see
take
them
all
are
for
thee
said
the
tree
while
it
bent
down
its
laden
boughs
low
this
song
almost
took
her
breath
away
he
too
sat
there
silent
after
he
was
through
as
though
he
had
sung
more
than
he
cared
to
say
to
her
darkness
has
great
power
over
those
who
are
sitting
in
it
and
dare
not
speak
they
are
never
so
near
each
other
as
then
if
eli
only
turned
only
moved
her
hand
on
the
only
breathed
a
little
more
heavily
than
usual
arne
heard
it
arne
could
not
you
teach
me
to
make
songs
have
you
never
tried
yes
these
last
few
days
i
have
but
i
have
not
succeeded
why
what
did
you
want
to
have
in
them
something
about
my
mother
who
cared
so
much
for
your
father
that
is
a
sad
theme
i
have
cried
over
it
too
you
must
not
think
of
what
you
are
going
to
put
in
your
songs
it
comes
of
itself
how
does
it
come
as
other
precious
things
when
you
least
expect
it
they
were
both
silent
i
wonder
arne
that
you
are
longing
to
go
away
when
you
have
so
much
that
is
beautiful
within
yourself
do
know
that
i
am
longing
she
made
no
reply
to
this
but
lay
still
a
few
moments
as
though
in
thought
arne
you
must
not
go
away
said
she
and
this
sent
a
glow
through
him
well
sometimes
i
have
less
desire
to
go
your
mother
must
be
very
fond
of
you
i
should
like
to
see
your
mother
come
over
to
kampen
when
you
are
well
and
now
all
at
once
he
pictured
her
sitting
in
the
cheerful
room
at
kampen
looking
out
on
the
mountains
his
chest
began
to
heave
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
it
is
warm
in
here
said
he
getting
up
she
heard
this
are
you
going
arne
asked
she
and
he
sat
down
again
you
must
come
over
to
us
often
mother
likes
you
so
much
i
should
be
glad
to
come
myself
but
i
must
have
some
errand
though
eli
was
silent
for
a
while
as
if
she
were
considering
something
i
believe
said
she
that
mother
has
something
she
wants
to
ask
of
you
he
heard
her
turn
in
bed
there
was
no
sound
to
be
heard
either
in
the
room
or
outside
save
the
ticking
of
the
clock
on
the
wall
at
last
she
burst
out
how
i
wish
it
were
summer
that
it
were
summer
and
there
rose
up
in
his
mind
blended
with
fragrant
foliage
and
the
tinkling
of
cattle
bells
shouts
from
the
mountains
singing
from
the
valleys
black
water
glittering
in
the
sunshine
the
gards
rocking
in
it
and
eli
coming
out
and
sitting
down
as
she
had
done
that
evening
long
ago
if
it
were
summer
said
she
and
i
were
sitting
on
the
hill
i
really
believe
i
could
sing
a
song
he
laughed
and
asked
what
would
it
be
about
oh
something
easy
about
i
do
not
know
myself
tell
me
eli
and
he
sprang
up
in
delight
then
recollecting
himself
he
sat
down
again
no
not
for
all
the
world
she
laughed
i
sang
for
you
when
you
asked
me
yes
you
did
but
no
no
eli
do
you
think
i
would
make
sport
of
your
little
verse
no
i
do
not
think
so
arne
but
it
is
not
anything
i
have
made
myself
it
is
by
some
one
else
then
yes
it
just
came
floating
of
itself
then
you
can
surely
repeat
it
to
me
no
no
it
is
not
altogether
that
either
arne
do
not
ask
me
any
more
she
must
have
hid
her
face
in
the
bedclothes
for
the
last
words
seemed
to
come
out
of
them
you
are
not
as
kind
to
me
now
eli
as
i
was
to
you
he
said
and
rose
arne
there
is
a
difference
you
do
not
understand
me
but
it
was
i
do
not
know
myself
another
time
do
not
be
angry
with
me
arne
do
not
go
away
from
me
she
began
to
weep
eli
what
is
the
matter
he
listened
are
you
feeling
ill
he
did
not
think
she
was
she
still
wept
he
thought
that
he
must
either
go
forward
or
backward
eli
yes
they
both
spoke
in
whispers
give
me
your
hand
she
did
not
answer
he
listened
intently
eagerly
felt
about
on
the
coverlid
and
clasped
a
warm
little
hand
that
lay
outside
they
heard
steps
on
the
stairs
and
let
go
of
each
other
hands
it
was
eli
mother
who
was
bringing
in
a
light
you
are
sitting
quite
too
long
in
the
dark
said
she
and
put
the
candlestick
on
the
table
but
neither
eli
nor
arne
could
bear
the
light
she
turned
toward
the
pillow
he
held
his
hand
up
before
his
eyes
oh
yes
it
hurts
the
eyes
a
little
at
first
said
her
mother
but
that
will
soon
pass
off
arne
searched
on
the
floor
for
the
cap
he
did
not
have
with
him
and
then
he
left
the
room
the
next
day
he
heard
that
eli
was
coming
for
a
little
while
after
dinner
he
gathered
together
his
tools
and
said
when
she
came
down
he
was
gone
chapter
xiii
spring
comes
late
in
the
mountains
the
mail
that
passed
along
the
highway
during
the
winter
three
times
a
week
in
april
only
passes
once
and
the
inhabitants
know
then
that
in
the
outside
world
the
snow
is
thawed
the
ice
broken
that
the
steamers
are
running
and
the
plow
put
into
the
earth
here
the
snow
still
lies
three
ells
deep
the
cattle
low
in
the
stalls
and
the
birds
come
but
hide
themselves
shivering
with
the
cold
occasionally
some
traveler
arrives
saying
he
has
left
his
cart
down
in
the
valley
and
he
has
flowers
with
him
which
he
shows
he
has
gathered
them
by
the
wayside
then
the
people
become
restless
go
about
talking
together
look
at
the
sky
and
down
in
the
valley
wondering
how
much
the
sun
gains
each
day
they
strew
ashes
on
the
snow
and
think
of
those
who
are
now
gathering
flowers
it
was
at
such
a
time
that
old
margit
kampen
came
walking
up
to
the
parsonage
and
asked
to
speak
with
father
she
was
invited
into
the
study
where
the
priest
a
slender
man
with
large
eyes
and
spectacles
received
her
kindly
knew
who
she
was
and
asked
her
to
sit
down
is
it
now
something
about
arne
again
he
inquired
as
though
they
had
often
talked
together
about
him
heaven
help
me
said
margit
it
is
never
anything
but
good
i
have
to
say
of
him
and
yet
my
heart
is
so
heavy
she
looked
very
sad
as
she
spoke
has
that
longing
come
back
again
asked
the
priest
worse
than
ever
said
the
mother
i
do
not
even
believe
he
will
stay
with
me
until
spring
comes
to
us
here
and
yet
he
has
promised
never
to
leave
you
true
enough
but
dear
me
he
must
manage
for
himself
now
when
the
mind
is
set
upon
going
go
one
must
i
suppose
but
what
will
become
of
me
still
i
will
believe
as
long
as
possible
that
he
will
not
leave
you
said
the
priest
certainly
not
but
what
if
he
should
never
be
content
at
home
i
would
then
have
it
on
my
conscience
that
i
stood
in
his
way
there
are
times
when
i
think
i
ought
to
ask
him
myself
to
go
away
how
do
you
know
that
he
is
longing
now
more
than
ever
oh
from
many
things
since
midwinter
he
has
not
worked
out
in
the
parish
a
single
day
on
the
other
hand
he
has
made
three
trips
to
town
and
has
stayed
away
a
long
while
each
time
he
scarcely
ever
talks
now
when
he
is
working
as
he
often
used
to
do
he
sits
for
hours
by
the
little
window
and
looks
out
over
the
mountains
in
the
direction
of
the
kamp
gorge
he
sometimes
stays
there
a
whole
sunday
afternoon
and
often
when
it
is
moonlight
he
sits
there
far
into
the
night
does
he
never
read
to
you
of
course
he
reads
and
sings
to
me
every
sunday
but
he
always
seems
in
a
hurry
except
now
and
then
when
he
overdoes
it
does
he
never
come
and
talk
with
you
he
often
lets
so
long
a
time
pass
without
saying
a
word
that
i
can
not
help
crying
when
i
sit
alone
then
i
suppose
he
sees
this
for
he
begins
to
talk
with
me
but
it
is
always
about
trifles
never
about
anything
serious
the
priest
was
walking
up
and
down
now
he
stopped
and
asked
why
do
you
not
speak
with
him
about
it
it
was
some
time
before
she
made
any
reply
to
this
she
sighed
several
times
she
looked
first
downward
then
on
either
side
she
folded
the
handkerchief
she
carried
i
came
here
to
have
a
talk
with
father
about
something
that
lies
heavily
on
my
heart
speak
freely
it
will
lighten
the
burden
i
know
that
for
i
have
now
dragged
it
along
alone
these
many
years
and
it
grows
heavier
each
year
what
is
it
my
good
woman
there
was
a
brief
pause
then
she
said
i
have
sinned
greatly
against
my
son
and
she
began
to
cry
the
priest
came
close
up
to
her
confess
it
to
me
said
he
then
we
will
together
pray
god
that
you
may
be
forgiven
margit
sobbed
and
dried
her
eyes
but
began
to
weep
afresh
as
soon
as
she
tried
to
speak
and
this
was
repeated
several
times
the
priest
comforted
her
and
said
she
surely
could
not
have
been
guilty
of
anything
very
sinful
that
she
was
no
doubt
too
strict
with
herself
and
so
on
margit
wept
however
and
could
not
muster
the
courage
to
begin
until
the
priest
had
seated
himself
by
her
side
and
spoken
kindly
words
to
her
then
in
broken
sentences
she
faltered
forth
her
confession
he
had
a
hard
time
of
it
when
he
was
a
boy
and
so
his
mind
became
bent
on
travel
then
he
met
kristian
he
who
has
grown
so
very
rich
over
there
where
they
dig
for
gold
kristian
gave
arne
so
many
books
that
he
ceased
to
be
like
the
rest
of
us
they
sat
together
in
the
long
evenings
and
when
kristian
went
away
my
boy
longed
to
follow
him
just
at
that
time
though
his
father
fell
down
dead
and
arne
promised
never
to
leave
me
yet
i
was
like
a
hen
that
had
brooded
a
duck
egg
when
the
young
duckling
had
burst
the
shell
he
wanted
to
go
out
on
the
great
water
and
i
remained
on
the
bank
screaming
if
he
did
not
actually
go
away
himself
his
heart
went
in
his
songs
and
every
morning
i
thought
i
would
find
his
bed
empty
then
there
came
a
letter
for
him
from
a
country
and
i
knew
it
must
be
from
kristian
god
forgive
me
i
hid
it
i
thought
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter
but
still
another
one
came
and
as
i
had
kept
the
first
from
him
i
had
to
keep
the
second
one
too
but
indeed
it
seemed
as
though
they
would
burn
a
hole
in
the
chest
where
they
lay
for
my
thoughts
would
go
there
from
the
time
i
opened
my
eyes
in
the
morning
until
i
closed
them
at
night
and
you
never
have
known
anything
so
bad
as
this
for
there
came
a
third
i
stood
holding
it
in
my
hand
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
carried
it
in
my
bosom
for
three
days
weighing
within
me
whether
i
should
give
it
to
him
or
lay
it
away
with
the
others
but
perhaps
it
would
have
power
to
lure
the
boy
away
from
me
and
i
could
not
help
it
i
put
the
letter
away
with
the
others
now
i
went
about
in
sorrow
every
day
both
because
of
those
that
were
in
the
chest
and
because
of
the
new
ones
that
might
come
i
was
afraid
of
every
person
who
came
to
our
house
when
we
were
in
the
house
together
and
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
i
trembled
for
it
might
be
a
letter
and
then
would
get
it
when
he
was
out
in
the
parish
i
kept
thinking
at
home
that
now
perhaps
he
would
get
a
letter
while
he
was
away
and
that
it
might
have
something
in
it
about
those
that
had
come
before
when
he
was
coming
home
i
watched
his
face
in
the
distance
and
dear
me
how
happy
i
was
when
i
saw
him
smiling
for
then
i
knew
he
had
no
letter
he
had
grown
so
handsome
too
just
like
his
father
but
much
fairer
and
more
and
then
he
had
such
a
voice
for
singing
when
he
sat
outside
of
the
door
at
sunset
singing
toward
the
mountain
ridge
and
listening
for
the
echo
i
felt
in
my
heart
that
i
never
could
live
without
him
if
i
only
saw
him
or
if
i
knew
he
was
anywhere
around
and
he
looked
tolerably
happy
and
would
only
give
me
a
word
now
and
then
i
wished
for
nothing
more
on
earth
and
would
not
have
had
a
single
tear
unshed
but
just
as
he
seemed
to
be
getting
on
better
and
to
be
feeling
more
at
ease
among
people
there
came
word
from
the
parish
that
a
fourth
letter
had
now
come
and
that
in
it
there
were
two
hundred
dollars
i
thought
i
should
drop
right
down
on
the
spot
where
i
stood
what
should
i
do
now
the
letter
of
course
i
could
get
out
of
the
way
but
the
money
i
could
not
sleep
for
several
nights
on
account
of
this
money
i
kept
it
up
in
the
garret
for
a
while
then
left
it
in
the
cellar
behind
a
barrel
and
once
i
was
so
beside
myself
that
i
laid
it
in
the
window
so
that
he
might
find
it
when
i
heard
him
coming
i
took
it
away
again
at
last
i
found
a
way
though
i
gave
him
the
money
and
said
it
had
been
out
at
interest
since
mother
lifetime
he
spent
it
in
improving
the
gard
as
had
been
in
my
own
mind
and
there
it
was
not
lost
but
then
it
happened
that
same
autumn
that
he
sat
one
evening
wondering
why
kristian
had
so
entirely
forgotten
him
now
the
wound
opened
afresh
and
the
money
burned
what
i
had
done
was
a
sin
and
the
sin
had
been
of
no
use
to
me
the
mother
who
has
sinned
against
her
own
child
is
the
most
unhappy
of
all
mothers
and
yet
i
only
did
it
out
of
love
so
i
shall
be
punished
i
dare
say
by
losing
what
is
dearest
to
me
for
since
midwinter
he
has
taken
up
again
the
tune
he
sings
when
he
is
longing
he
has
sung
it
from
boyhood
up
and
i
never
hear
it
without
growing
pale
then
i
feel
i
could
give
up
all
for
him
and
now
you
shall
see
for
yourself
she
took
a
scrap
of
paper
out
of
her
bosom
unfolded
it
and
gave
it
to
the
priest
here
is
something
he
is
writing
at
from
time
to
time
it
certainly
belongs
to
that
song
i
brought
it
with
me
for
i
can
not
read
such
fine
writing
please
see
if
there
is
anything
in
it
about
his
going
away
there
was
only
one
stanza
on
this
paper
for
the
second
one
there
were
half
and
whole
lines
here
and
there
as
if
it
were
a
song
he
had
forgotten
and
was
now
calling
to
mind
again
verse
by
verse
the
first
stanza
ran
oh
how
i
wonder
what
i
should
see
over
the
lofty
mountains
snow
here
shuts
out
the
view
from
me
round
about
stands
the
green
longing
to
hasten
over
dare
it
become
a
rover
is
it
about
his
going
away
asked
margit
her
eyes
fixed
eagerly
on
the
priest
face
yes
it
is
answered
he
and
let
the
paper
drop
was
i
not
sure
of
it
ah
me
i
know
that
tune
so
well
she
looked
at
the
priest
her
hands
folded
anxious
intent
while
tear
after
tear
trickled
down
her
cheek
but
the
priest
knew
as
little
how
to
advise
as
she
the
boy
must
be
left
to
himself
in
this
matter
said
he
life
can
not
be
altered
for
his
sake
but
it
depends
on
himself
whether
he
shall
one
day
find
out
its
meaning
now
it
seems
he
wants
to
go
away
to
do
so
but
was
it
not
just
so
with
the
old
woman
said
margit
with
the
old
woman
repeated
the
priest
yes
she
who
went
out
to
fetch
the
sunshine
into
her
house
instead
of
cutting
windows
in
the
walls
the
priest
was
astonished
at
her
shrewdness
but
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
surprised
him
when
she
was
on
this
theme
for
margit
indeed
had
not
thought
of
anything
else
for
seven
or
eight
years
do
you
think
he
will
leave
me
what
shall
i
do
and
the
money
and
the
letters
all
this
crowded
upon
her
at
once
well
it
was
not
right
about
the
letters
you
can
hardly
be
justified
in
withholding
from
your
son
what
belonged
to
him
it
was
still
worse
however
to
place
a
fellow
christian
in
a
bad
light
when
it
was
not
deserved
and
the
worst
of
all
was
that
it
was
one
whom
arne
loved
and
who
was
very
fond
of
him
in
return
but
we
will
pray
god
to
forgive
you
we
will
both
pray
margit
bowed
her
head
she
still
sat
with
her
hands
folded
how
earnestly
i
would
pray
him
for
forgiveness
if
i
only
knew
he
would
stay
she
was
probably
confounding
in
her
mind
the
lord
and
arne
the
priest
pretended
he
had
not
noticed
this
do
you
mean
to
confess
this
to
him
at
once
he
asked
she
looked
down
and
said
in
a
low
tone
if
i
dared
wait
a
little
while
i
should
like
to
do
so
the
priest
turned
aside
to
hide
a
smile
as
he
asked
do
you
not
think
your
sin
becomes
greater
the
longer
you
delay
the
confession
both
hands
were
busied
with
her
handkerchief
she
folded
it
into
a
very
small
square
and
tried
to
get
it
into
a
still
smaller
one
but
that
was
not
possible
if
i
confess
about
the
letters
i
am
afraid
he
will
leave
me
you
dare
not
place
your
reliance
on
the
lord
then
why
to
be
sure
i
do
she
said
hurriedly
then
she
added
softly
but
what
if
he
should
go
anyway
so
then
you
are
more
afraid
of
arne
leaving
you
than
of
continuing
in
sin
margit
had
unfolded
her
handkerchief
again
she
put
it
now
to
her
eyes
for
she
was
beginning
to
weep
the
priest
watched
her
for
a
while
then
he
continued
why
did
you
tell
me
all
this
when
you
did
not
mean
it
to
lead
to
anything
he
waited
a
long
time
but
she
did
not
answer
you
thought
perhaps
your
sin
would
become
less
when
you
had
confessed
it
i
thought
that
it
would
said
she
softly
with
her
head
bowed
still
farther
down
on
her
breast
the
priest
smiled
and
got
up
well
well
my
dear
margit
you
must
act
so
that
you
will
have
joy
in
your
old
age
if
i
could
only
keep
what
i
have
said
she
and
the
priest
thought
she
dared
not
imagine
any
greater
happiness
than
living
in
her
constant
state
of
anxiety
he
smiled
as
he
lit
his
pipe
if
we
only
had
a
little
girl
who
could
get
hold
of
him
then
you
should
see
that
he
would
stay
she
looked
up
quickly
and
her
eyes
followed
the
priest
until
he
paused
in
front
of
her
eli
böen
what
she
colored
and
looked
down
again
but
she
made
no
reply
the
priest
who
had
stood
still
waiting
said
finally
but
this
time
in
quite
a
low
tone
what
if
we
should
arrange
it
so
that
they
should
meet
oftener
at
the
parsonage
she
glanced
up
at
the
priest
to
find
out
whether
he
was
really
in
earnest
but
she
did
not
quite
dare
believe
him
the
priest
had
begun
to
walk
up
and
down
again
but
now
he
paused
see
here
margit
when
it
comes
to
the
point
perhaps
this
was
your
whole
errand
here
hey
she
bowed
her
head
far
down
she
thrust
two
fingers
into
the
folded
handkerchief
and
brought
out
a
corner
of
it
well
yes
god
help
me
that
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
the
priest
burst
out
laughing
and
rubbed
his
hands
perhaps
that
was
what
you
wanted
the
last
time
you
were
here
too
she
drew
the
corner
of
the
handkerchief
farther
out
she
stretched
it
and
stretched
it
since
you
ask
me
yes
it
was
just
that
ha
ha
ha
ha
ah
margit
margit
we
shall
see
what
we
can
do
for
to
tell
the
truth
my
wife
and
daughter
have
for
a
long
time
had
the
same
thoughts
as
you
is
it
possible
she
looked
up
at
once
so
happy
and
so
bashful
that
the
priest
had
his
own
delight
in
her
open
pretty
face
in
which
the
childlike
expression
had
been
preserved
through
all
sorrow
and
anxiety
ah
well
margit
you
whose
love
is
so
great
will
i
have
no
doubt
obtain
forgiveness
for
love
sake
both
from
your
god
and
from
your
son
for
the
wrong
you
have
done
you
have
probably
been
punished
enough
already
in
the
continual
wearing
anxiety
you
have
lived
in
we
shall
if
god
is
willing
bring
this
to
a
speedy
end
for
if
he
this
he
will
help
us
a
little
now
she
drew
a
long
sigh
which
she
repeated
again
and
again
then
she
arose
gave
her
thanks
dropped
a
courtesy
and
courtesied
again
at
the
door
but
she
was
scarcely
well
outside
before
a
change
came
over
her
she
cast
upward
a
look
beaming
with
gratitude
and
she
hurried
more
and
more
the
farther
she
got
away
from
people
and
lightly
as
she
tripped
down
toward
kampen
that
day
she
had
not
done
for
many
many
years
when
she
got
so
far
on
her
way
that
she
could
see
the
thick
smoke
curling
gayly
up
from
the
chimney
she
blessed
the
house
the
whole
gard
the
priest
and
arne
and
then
remembered
that
they
were
going
to
have
smoked
beef
for
dinner
her
favorite
dish
chapter
xiv
kampen
was
a
beautiful
gard
it
lay
in
the
midst
of
a
plain
bordered
below
by
the
kamp
gorge
and
above
by
the
parish
road
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
was
a
thick
wood
a
little
farther
beyond
a
rising
mountain
ridge
and
behind
this
the
blue
mountains
on
the
other
side
of
the
gorge
there
was
also
a
broad
mountain
range
which
first
entirely
surrounded
black
water
on
the
side
where
böen
lay
then
grew
higher
toward
kampen
but
at
the
same
time
turned
aside
to
make
way
for
the
broad
basin
called
the
lower
parish
and
which
began
just
below
for
kampen
was
the
last
gard
in
the
upper
parish
the
front
door
of
the
was
turned
toward
the
road
it
was
probably
about
two
thousand
paces
off
a
path
with
leafy
on
either
side
led
thither
the
wood
lay
on
both
sides
of
the
clearing
the
fields
and
meadows
could
therefore
extend
as
far
as
the
owners
themselves
wished
it
was
in
all
respects
a
most
excellent
gard
a
little
garden
lay
in
front
of
the
house
arne
managed
it
as
his
books
directed
to
the
left
were
the
stables
and
other
they
were
nearly
all
new
built
and
formed
a
square
opposite
the
the
latter
was
painted
red
with
white
and
doors
was
two
stories
high
thatched
with
turf
and
small
shrubs
grew
on
the
roof
the
one
gable
had
a
vane
staff
on
which
turned
an
iron
cock
with
high
spread
tail
spring
had
come
to
the
mountain
districts
it
was
a
sunday
morning
there
was
a
little
heaviness
in
the
air
but
it
was
calm
and
without
frost
mist
hung
over
the
wood
but
margit
thought
it
would
lift
during
the
day
arne
had
read
the
sermon
for
his
mother
and
sung
the
hymns
which
had
done
him
good
now
he
was
in
full
trim
ready
to
go
up
to
the
parsonage
he
opened
the
door
the
fresh
perfume
of
the
leaves
was
wafted
toward
him
the
garden
lay
and
bowed
by
the
morning
mist
and
from
the
kamp
gorge
there
came
a
roaring
mingled
at
intervals
with
mighty
booms
making
everything
tremble
to
the
ear
and
the
eye
arne
walked
upward
the
farther
he
got
from
the
force
the
less
became
its
roar
which
finally
spread
itself
like
the
deep
tones
of
an
organ
over
the
whole
landscape
the
lord
be
with
him
on
his
way
said
the
mother
opening
the
window
and
looking
after
him
until
the
shrubbery
closed
about
him
the
fog
lifted
more
and
more
the
sun
cut
through
it
there
was
life
now
about
the
fields
and
in
the
garden
all
arne
work
sprouted
out
in
fresh
growth
sending
fragrance
and
joy
up
to
the
mother
spring
is
lovely
to
those
who
long
have
been
surrounded
by
winter
arne
had
no
fixed
errand
at
the
parsonage
but
still
he
wanted
to
learn
about
the
papers
he
and
the
priest
took
together
recently
he
had
seen
the
names
of
several
norsemen
who
had
done
remarkably
well
digging
gold
in
america
and
among
them
was
kristian
now
arne
had
heard
a
rumor
that
kristian
was
expected
home
he
could
no
doubt
get
information
about
this
at
the
parsonage
and
if
kristian
had
really
returned
then
arne
would
go
to
him
in
the
interval
between
spring
and
haying
time
this
was
working
in
his
mind
until
he
had
advanced
so
far
that
he
could
see
black
water
and
böen
on
the
other
side
the
fog
had
lifted
there
too
the
sun
was
playing
on
the
green
the
mountain
loomed
up
with
shining
peak
but
the
fog
was
still
lying
in
its
lap
the
wood
darkened
the
water
on
the
right
side
but
in
front
of
the
house
the
ground
was
more
flat
and
its
white
sand
glittered
in
the
sunshine
suddenly
his
thoughts
sped
to
the
building
with
white
doors
and
that
he
had
had
in
mind
when
he
painted
his
own
he
did
not
remember
those
first
gloomy
days
he
had
passed
there
he
only
thought
of
that
bright
summer
they
had
both
seen
he
and
eli
up
beside
her
since
then
he
had
not
been
to
böen
nor
would
he
go
there
not
for
the
whole
world
if
only
his
thoughts
barely
touched
on
it
he
grew
crimson
and
abashed
and
yet
this
happened
again
every
day
and
many
times
a
day
if
there
was
anything
which
could
drive
him
out
of
the
parish
it
was
just
this
onward
he
went
as
though
he
would
flee
from
his
thoughts
but
the
farther
he
walked
the
nearer
opposite
böen
he
came
and
the
more
he
gazed
upon
it
the
fog
was
entirely
gone
the
sky
clear
from
one
mountain
outline
to
the
other
the
birds
sailed
along
and
called
aloud
to
one
another
in
the
glad
sunny
air
the
fields
responded
with
millions
of
flowers
the
kamp
force
did
not
here
compel
gladness
to
bow
the
knee
in
submission
and
awe
but
buoyant
and
frolicsome
it
tumbled
over
singing
twinkling
rejoicing
without
end
arne
had
walked
till
he
was
in
a
glowing
heat
he
flung
himself
down
in
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
looked
over
towards
böen
then
turned
away
to
avoid
seeing
it
presently
he
heard
singing
above
him
pure
and
clear
as
song
had
never
sounded
to
him
before
it
floated
out
over
the
meadow
mingled
with
the
chattering
of
the
birds
and
he
was
scarcely
sure
of
the
tune
before
he
recognized
the
words
too
for
the
tune
was
his
favorite
one
and
the
words
were
those
that
had
been
working
in
his
mind
from
the
time
he
was
a
boy
and
forgotten
the
same
day
he
had
brought
them
forth
he
sprang
up
as
though
he
would
catch
them
then
paused
and
listened
here
came
the
first
stanza
here
came
the
second
here
came
the
third
and
the
fourth
of
his
own
forgotten
song
streaming
down
to
him
oh
how
i
wonder
what
i
should
see
over
the
lofty
mountains
snow
here
shuts
out
the
view
from
me
round
about
stands
the
green
longing
to
hasten
over
dare
it
become
a
rover
soars
the
eagle
with
strong
wing
play
over
the
lofty
mountains
rows
through
the
young
and
vigorous
day
sating
his
courage
in
quest
of
prey
when
he
will
swooping
downward
lands
gazing
onward
apple
wilt
thou
not
go
over
the
lofty
mountains
forth
putting
buds
summer
glow
thou
wilt
till
next
time
wait
i
know
all
of
these
birds
art
swinging
knowing
not
what
they
singing
he
who
for
twenty
years
longed
to
flee
over
the
lofty
mountains
nor
beyond
them
can
hope
to
see
smaller
each
year
feels
himself
to
be
hears
what
the
birds
are
singing
thou
art
with
confidence
swinging
bird
with
thy
what
wouldst
thou
here
over
the
lofty
mountains
fairer
the
lands
beyond
must
appear
higher
the
trees
and
the
skies
far
more
clear
wouldst
thou
but
longing
be
bringing
bird
but
no
wings
with
thy
singing
shall
i
the
journey
never
take
over
the
lofty
mountains
must
my
poor
thoughts
on
this
break
must
it
a
dread
prison
make
shutting
at
last
in
around
me
till
for
my
tomb
it
surround
me
forth
will
i
forth
oh
far
far
away
over
the
lofty
mountains
i
will
be
crushed
and
consumed
if
i
stay
courage
up
and
seeks
the
way
let
it
its
flight
now
be
taking
not
on
this
be
breaking
one
day
i
know
i
shall
wander
afar
over
the
lofty
mountains
lord
my
god
is
thy
door
ajar
good
is
thy
home
where
the
blessed
are
keep
it
though
closed
a
while
longer
till
my
deep
longing
grow
stronger
arne
stood
still
until
the
last
verse
the
last
word
had
died
away
again
he
heard
the
birds
sporting
and
twittering
but
he
knew
not
whether
he
himself
dared
stir
find
out
who
had
been
singing
though
he
must
he
raised
his
foot
and
trod
so
carefully
that
he
could
not
hear
the
grass
rustle
a
little
butterfly
alighted
on
a
flower
directly
at
his
feet
had
to
start
up
again
flew
only
a
little
piece
farther
had
to
start
up
again
and
so
on
all
over
the
hill
as
he
crept
cautiously
up
soon
he
came
to
a
leafy
bush
and
cared
to
go
no
farther
for
now
he
could
see
a
bird
flew
up
from
the
bush
gave
a
startled
cry
and
darted
over
the
sloping
and
then
she
who
was
sitting
within
view
looked
up
arne
stooped
far
down
holding
his
breath
his
heart
throbbing
so
wildly
that
he
heard
its
every
beat
listening
not
daring
to
move
a
leaf
for
it
was
indeed
she
it
was
eli
whom
he
saw
after
a
long
long
while
he
looked
up
just
a
little
and
would
gladly
have
drawn
a
step
nearer
but
he
thought
the
bird
might
perhaps
have
its
nest
under
the
bush
and
was
afraid
he
would
tread
on
it
he
peered
out
between
the
leaves
as
they
blew
aside
and
closed
together
again
the
sun
shone
directly
on
her
she
wore
a
black
dress
without
sleeves
and
had
a
boy
straw
hat
perched
lightly
on
her
head
and
slanting
a
little
to
one
side
in
her
lap
lay
a
book
and
on
it
a
profusion
of
wild
flowers
her
right
hand
was
dreamily
toying
with
them
in
her
left
which
rested
on
her
knee
her
head
was
bowed
she
was
gazing
in
the
direction
of
the
bird
flight
and
it
really
seemed
as
though
she
had
been
weeping
anything
more
lovely
arne
had
neither
seen
nor
dreamed
of
in
his
whole
life
the
sun
too
had
scattered
all
its
gold
over
her
and
the
spot
where
she
was
sitting
and
the
song
still
floated
about
her
although
its
last
notes
had
long
since
been
sung
so
that
he
thought
breathed
aye
even
his
heart
beat
in
time
to
it
she
took
up
the
book
and
opened
it
but
soon
closed
it
again
and
sat
as
before
beginning
to
hum
something
else
it
was
the
tree
early
were
bursting
their
brown
he
knew
it
at
once
although
she
did
not
quite
remember
either
the
words
or
the
tune
and
made
many
mistakes
the
stanza
she
knew
best
was
the
last
one
therefore
she
often
repeated
it
but
she
sang
it
thus
the
tree
bore
its
berries
so
mellow
and
red
i
gather
thy
berries
a
sweet
maiden
said
dear
all
thou
canst
see
take
them
all
are
for
thee
said
the
tree
trala
lala
said
then
suddenly
she
sprang
up
scattering
the
flowers
all
around
her
and
sang
aloud
so
that
the
tune
as
it
quivered
through
the
air
could
easily
be
heard
all
the
way
over
to
böen
and
then
she
ran
away
should
he
call
after
her
no
there
she
went
skipping
over
the
hills
singing
trolling
her
hat
fell
off
she
picked
it
up
again
and
then
she
stood
still
in
the
midst
of
the
tallest
grass
shall
i
call
after
her
she
is
looking
round
he
quickly
stooped
down
it
was
a
long
while
before
he
dared
peep
forth
again
at
first
he
only
raised
his
head
he
could
not
see
her
then
he
drew
himself
up
on
his
knees
and
still
could
not
see
her
finally
he
got
all
the
way
up
no
she
was
gone
he
no
longer
wanted
to
go
to
the
parsonage
he
wanted
nothing
later
he
sat
where
she
had
been
sitting
still
sat
there
until
the
sun
drew
near
the
meridian
the
lake
was
not
ruffled
by
a
single
ripple
the
smoke
from
the
gards
began
to
curl
upward
the
one
after
another
had
ceased
their
call
the
small
birds
though
continued
their
sportive
gambols
but
withdrew
to
the
wood
the
dew
was
gone
and
the
grass
looked
sober
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
leaves
it
was
about
an
hour
from
noon
arne
scarcely
knew
how
it
was
that
he
found
himself
seated
there
weaving
together
a
little
song
a
sweet
melody
offered
itself
for
it
and
into
a
heart
curiously
full
of
all
that
was
gentle
the
tune
came
and
went
until
the
picture
was
complete
he
sang
the
song
calmly
as
he
had
made
it
he
went
in
the
forest
the
whole
day
long
the
whole
day
long
for
there
he
had
heard
such
a
wonderful
song
a
wonderful
song
he
fashioned
a
flute
from
a
willow
spray
a
willow
spray
to
see
if
within
it
the
sweet
tune
lay
the
sweet
tune
lay
it
whispered
and
told
him
its
name
at
last
its
name
at
last
but
then
while
he
listened
away
it
passed
away
it
passed
but
oft
when
he
slumbered
again
it
stole
again
it
stole
with
touches
of
love
upon
his
soul
upon
his
soul
then
he
tried
to
catch
it
and
keep
it
fast
and
keep
it
fast
but
he
woke
and
away
in
the
night
it
passed
in
the
night
it
passed
lord
let
me
pass
in
the
night
i
pray
in
the
night
i
pray
for
the
tune
has
taken
my
heart
away
my
heart
away
then
answered
the
lord
is
thy
friend
it
is
thy
friend
though
not
for
an
hour
shall
thy
longing
end
thy
longing
end
all
the
others
are
nothing
to
thee
nothing
to
thee
to
this
that
thou
seekest
and
never
shalt
see
never
shalt
see
chapter
xv
it
was
a
sunday
evening
in
midsummer
the
priest
had
returned
from
church
and
margit
had
been
sitting
with
him
until
it
was
nearly
seven
now
she
took
her
leave
and
hastened
down
the
steps
and
out
into
the
yard
for
there
she
had
just
caught
sight
of
eli
böen
who
had
been
playing
for
some
time
with
the
priest
son
and
her
own
brother
good
evening
said
margit
standing
still
and
god
bless
you
all
good
evening
replied
eli
blushing
crimson
and
showing
a
desire
to
stop
playing
although
the
boys
urged
her
to
continue
but
she
begged
to
be
excused
and
they
had
to
let
her
go
for
that
evening
it
seems
to
me
i
ought
to
know
you
said
margit
that
is
quite
likely
was
the
reply
this
surely
never
can
be
eli
böen
yes
it
was
she
oh
dear
me
so
you
are
eli
böen
yes
now
i
see
you
are
like
your
mother
eli
auburn
hair
had
become
unfastened
so
that
it
floated
carelessly
about
her
her
face
was
as
hot
and
as
red
as
a
berry
her
bosom
heaved
she
could
not
speak
and
laughed
because
she
was
so
out
of
breath
yes
that
is
the
way
with
young
people
margit
looked
at
eli
with
satisfaction
as
she
spoke
i
suppose
you
do
not
know
me
eli
had
no
doubt
wanted
to
ask
who
she
was
but
could
not
command
the
courage
to
do
so
because
the
other
was
so
much
older
than
she
now
she
said
that
she
did
not
remember
having
seen
her
before
well
to
be
sure
that
is
scarcely
to
be
expected
old
folks
seldom
get
out
you
may
perhaps
know
my
son
arne
kampen
i
am
his
mother
she
stole
a
sly
glance
as
she
spoke
at
eli
on
whom
these
words
wrought
a
considerable
change
i
am
inclined
to
think
he
worked
over
at
böen
once
did
he
not
yes
it
was
eli
impression
too
that
he
had
done
so
the
weather
is
fine
this
evening
we
turned
our
hay
and
got
it
in
before
i
left
home
it
is
really
blessed
weather
there
will
surely
be
a
good
this
year
eli
observed
yes
you
may
well
say
so
i
suppose
everything
looks
splendidly
over
at
böen
they
are
through
harvesting
there
oh
of
course
plenty
of
help
stirring
people
are
you
going
home
this
evening
no
she
did
not
intend
to
do
so
they
talked
together
about
one
thing
and
another
and
gradually
became
so
well
acquainted
that
margit
felt
at
liberty
to
ask
eli
to
walk
a
short
distance
with
her
could
you
not
keep
me
company
a
few
steps
said
she
i
so
seldom
find
any
one
to
talk
with
and
i
dare
say
it
will
make
no
difference
to
you
eli
excused
herself
because
she
had
not
her
jacket
on
well
i
know
it
is
really
a
shame
to
ask
such
a
thing
the
first
time
i
meet
a
person
but
then
one
has
to
bear
with
old
folks
eli
said
she
was
quite
willing
to
go
she
only
wanted
to
fetch
her
jacket
it
was
a
jacket
when
it
was
hooked
she
looked
as
if
she
wore
a
complete
dress
but
now
she
only
fastened
the
two
lowest
hooks
she
was
so
warm
her
fine
linen
had
a
small
turned
down
collar
and
was
fastened
at
the
throat
with
a
silver
button
in
the
form
of
a
bird
with
outspread
wings
such
a
one
tailor
nils
had
worn
the
first
time
margit
kampen
had
danced
with
him
what
a
handsome
button
she
remarked
looking
at
it
my
mother
gave
it
to
me
said
eli
yes
so
i
thought
and
margit
helped
the
girl
adjust
it
as
she
spoke
now
they
walked
on
along
the
road
the
hay
was
lying
about
in
heaps
margit
took
up
a
handful
smelled
it
and
thought
it
was
good
she
asked
about
the
live
stock
at
the
parsonage
was
led
thereby
to
inquire
about
that
at
böen
and
then
told
how
much
they
had
at
kampen
the
gard
has
prospered
finely
of
late
years
and
it
can
be
made
as
much
larger
as
we
ourselves
wish
it
feeds
twelve
milch
cows
now
and
could
feed
more
but
arne
reads
a
great
many
books
and
manages
according
to
them
and
so
he
must
have
his
cows
fed
in
a
way
eli
made
no
reply
to
all
this
as
was
quite
natural
but
margit
asked
her
how
old
she
was
she
was
nineteen
have
you
taken
any
part
in
the
you
look
so
dainty
i
suppose
it
has
not
been
much
oh
yes
she
had
helped
in
various
ways
especially
of
late
well
it
is
a
good
thing
to
become
accustomed
to
a
little
of
everything
if
one
should
get
a
large
house
of
one
own
there
might
be
many
things
to
be
done
but
to
be
sure
when
one
finds
good
help
already
in
the
house
it
does
not
matter
so
very
much
eli
now
thought
she
ought
to
turn
back
for
they
had
gone
far
beyond
the
parsonage
lands
it
will
be
some
time
yet
before
the
sun
sets
it
would
be
kind
if
you
would
chat
with
me
a
little
longer
and
eli
went
on
then
margit
began
to
talk
about
arne
i
do
not
know
if
you
are
very
well
acquainted
with
him
he
can
teach
you
something
about
everything
bless
me
how
much
that
boy
has
read
eli
confessed
that
she
was
aware
he
had
read
a
great
deal
oh
yes
that
is
really
the
least
that
can
be
said
of
him
why
his
conduct
to
his
mother
all
his
days
is
something
far
beyond
that
if
the
old
saying
is
true
that
one
who
is
good
to
his
mother
is
sure
to
be
good
to
his
wife
the
girl
arne
chooses
will
not
have
very
much
to
grumble
about
what
is
it
you
are
looking
for
child
i
only
lost
a
little
twig
i
had
in
my
hand
they
were
both
silent
after
this
and
walked
on
without
looking
at
each
other
he
has
such
strange
ways
began
the
mother
presently
he
was
so
often
frightened
when
he
was
a
child
that
he
got
into
the
habit
of
thinking
everything
over
to
himself
and
such
folks
never
know
how
to
put
themselves
forward
now
eli
insisted
on
turning
back
but
margit
assured
her
that
it
was
only
a
short
distance
now
to
kampen
and
see
kampen
she
must
as
she
was
so
near
but
eli
thought
it
was
too
late
that
day
there
is
always
some
one
who
can
go
home
with
you
said
margit
no
no
promptly
replied
eli
and
was
about
to
leave
to
be
sure
arne
is
not
at
home
said
margit
so
it
will
not
be
he
but
there
will
be
sure
to
be
some
one
else
now
eli
had
less
objection
to
going
besides
she
wanted
very
much
to
see
kampen
if
only
it
does
not
grow
too
late
said
she
well
if
we
stand
here
much
longer
talking
about
it
i
suppose
it
may
grow
too
late
and
they
went
on
you
have
read
a
great
deal
i
dare
say
you
who
were
brought
up
at
the
priest
yes
eli
had
read
a
good
deal
that
will
be
useful
margit
suggested
when
you
are
married
to
one
who
knows
less
than
you
eli
thought
she
would
never
be
married
to
such
a
person
ah
well
it
would
perhaps
not
be
best
either
but
in
this
parish
there
is
so
little
learning
eli
asked
where
the
smoke
rising
yonder
in
the
wood
came
from
it
comes
from
the
new
houseman
place
belonging
to
kampen
a
man
called
upland
knut
lives
there
he
was
alone
in
the
world
and
so
arne
gave
him
that
place
to
clear
he
knows
what
it
is
to
be
lonely
my
poor
arne
soon
they
reached
an
ascent
whence
the
gard
could
be
seen
the
sun
shone
full
in
their
faces
they
held
up
their
hands
to
shade
their
eyes
and
gazed
down
at
kampen
it
lay
in
the
midst
of
a
plain
the
houses
red
painted
and
with
white
the
grass
in
the
surrounding
meadows
had
been
mown
the
hay
might
still
be
seen
in
heaps
here
and
there
the
lay
green
and
rich
among
the
pale
meadows
over
by
the
all
was
stir
and
bustle
the
cows
sheep
and
goats
were
just
coming
home
their
bells
were
tinkling
the
dogs
were
barking
the
shouting
while
above
all
rose
with
awful
din
the
roar
of
the
force
in
the
kamp
gorge
the
longer
eli
looked
the
more
completely
this
grand
tune
filled
her
ears
and
at
last
it
seemed
so
appalling
to
her
that
her
heart
throbbed
wildly
it
roared
and
thundered
through
her
head
until
she
grew
bewildered
and
at
the
same
time
felt
so
warm
and
tender
that
involuntarily
she
took
such
short
hesitating
steps
that
margit
begged
her
to
walk
a
little
faster
she
started
i
never
heard
anything
like
that
waterfall
said
she
i
am
almost
afraid
of
it
you
will
soon
get
used
to
it
said
the
mother
at
last
you
would
even
miss
it
if
you
could
not
hear
it
dear
me
do
you
think
so
cried
eli
well
you
will
see
said
margit
smiling
come
now
let
us
first
look
at
the
cattle
she
continued
turning
off
from
the
main
road
these
trees
on
each
side
nils
planted
he
wanted
to
have
everything
nice
nils
did
that
is
what
arne
likes
too
look
there
you
can
see
the
garden
my
boy
has
laid
out
oh
how
pretty
cried
eli
running
over
to
the
garden
fence
she
had
often
seen
kampen
but
only
from
a
distance
where
the
garden
was
not
visible
we
will
look
at
that
after
a
while
said
margit
eli
hastily
glanced
through
the
windows
as
she
went
past
the
house
there
was
no
one
inside
they
stationed
themselves
on
the
and
watched
the
cows
as
they
passed
lowing
into
the
stable
margit
named
them
to
eli
told
how
much
milk
each
one
gave
and
which
of
them
calved
in
the
summer
which
did
not
the
sheep
were
counted
and
let
into
the
fold
they
were
of
a
large
foreign
breed
arne
had
raised
them
from
two
lambs
he
got
from
the
south
he
gives
much
attention
to
all
such
things
although
you
would
not
think
it
of
him
they
now
went
into
the
barn
and
examined
the
hay
that
had
been
housed
and
eli
had
to
smell
it
for
such
hay
is
not
to
be
found
everywhere
margit
pointed
through
the
over
the
fields
and
told
what
each
one
yielded
and
how
much
was
sown
of
each
kind
of
seed
they
went
out
toward
the
house
but
eli
who
had
not
spoken
a
word
in
reply
to
all
that
had
been
said
as
they
passed
by
the
garden
asked
if
she
might
go
into
it
and
when
leave
had
been
given
her
to
go
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
pluck
a
flower
or
two
there
was
a
little
bench
away
in
one
corner
she
went
and
sat
down
on
it
only
to
try
it
apparently
for
she
rose
at
once
we
must
hurry
now
if
we
would
not
be
too
late
said
margit
standing
in
the
door
and
now
they
went
in
margit
asked
eli
if
she
should
offer
her
some
refreshments
on
this
her
first
visit
but
eli
blushed
and
hastily
declined
then
the
girl
eyes
wandered
all
around
the
room
they
had
entered
it
was
where
the
family
sat
in
the
and
the
windows
opened
on
the
road
the
room
was
not
large
but
it
was
cozy
and
there
was
a
clock
and
a
stove
in
it
on
the
wall
hung
nils
fiddle
dingy
and
old
but
with
new
strings
near
it
also
hung
a
couple
of
guns
belonging
to
arne
an
english
and
other
rare
things
which
the
mother
took
down
and
showed
to
eli
who
looked
at
them
and
handled
them
the
room
was
without
paint
for
arne
disliked
it
nor
was
there
any
painting
in
the
room
looking
toward
the
kamp
gorge
with
the
fresh
green
mountains
directly
opposite
and
the
blue
ones
in
the
background
this
latter
room
which
was
in
the
new
part
of
the
building
as
was
the
entire
half
of
the
house
it
was
in
was
larger
and
prettier
than
the
first
the
two
smaller
rooms
in
the
wing
were
painted
for
there
the
mother
was
to
live
when
she
was
old
and
arne
had
brought
a
wife
into
the
house
they
went
into
the
kitchen
the
the
eli
spoke
not
a
single
word
indeed
she
viewed
everything
about
her
as
though
from
afar
off
only
when
anything
was
held
out
for
her
inspection
she
touched
it
but
very
daintily
margit
who
had
kept
up
an
unbroken
stream
of
chatter
the
whole
way
now
led
her
into
the
passage
again
they
must
go
and
take
a
look
there
also
were
rooms
corresponding
with
those
below
but
they
were
new
and
had
scarcely
yet
been
occupied
except
one
which
looked
toward
the
gorge
in
these
rooms
were
kept
all
sorts
of
articles
which
were
not
in
daily
household
use
here
hung
a
whole
lot
of
robes
together
with
other
bedclothes
the
mother
took
hold
of
them
lifted
them
up
and
now
and
then
insisted
on
having
eli
do
the
same
meanwhile
it
actually
seemed
as
though
the
young
girl
were
gaining
a
little
courage
or
else
her
pleasure
in
these
things
increased
for
to
some
of
them
she
went
back
a
second
time
asked
questions
about
them
and
became
more
and
more
interested
finally
the
mother
said
now
at
last
we
will
go
into
arne
own
room
and
then
they
went
into
the
room
overlooking
the
kamp
gorge
once
more
the
awful
din
of
the
force
smote
upon
their
ears
for
the
window
was
open
they
were
up
so
high
that
they
could
see
the
spray
rising
between
the
mountains
but
not
the
force
itself
save
in
one
spot
farther
on
where
a
fragment
had
fallen
from
the
cliff
just
where
the
torrent
with
all
its
might
took
its
final
leap
into
the
depths
below
fresh
turf
covered
the
upward
turned
side
of
this
fallen
piece
of
rock
a
few
fir
cones
had
buried
themselves
in
it
and
sent
forth
a
growth
of
trees
with
their
roots
in
the
crevices
the
wind
had
tugged
at
and
shaken
the
trees
the
force
had
washed
them
so
completely
that
there
was
not
a
branch
four
ells
from
the
roots
they
were
crooked
in
the
knees
their
boughs
knotted
and
gnarled
yet
they
kept
their
footing
and
shot
far
up
between
the
rocky
walls
this
was
the
first
thing
eli
noticed
from
the
window
the
next
the
dazzling
white
peaks
rising
above
the
green
mountains
she
turned
her
eyes
away
let
them
wander
over
the
peaceful
fruitful
fields
and
finally
about
the
room
where
she
stood
the
roar
of
the
force
had
hitherto
prevented
this
how
calm
and
cheerful
it
was
within
compared
with
the
scene
without
she
did
not
look
at
any
single
article
because
one
blended
into
the
other
and
most
of
them
were
new
to
her
for
arne
had
centred
his
affections
in
this
room
and
simple
as
it
was
it
was
artistic
in
almost
every
particular
it
seemed
as
though
the
sound
of
his
songs
came
floating
toward
her
while
she
stood
there
or
as
though
he
himself
smiled
at
her
from
every
object
the
first
thing
her
eyes
singled
out
in
the
room
was
a
broad
handsomely
carved
there
were
so
many
books
on
it
that
she
did
not
believe
the
priest
had
more
a
pretty
cabinet
was
the
next
thing
she
noticed
here
he
kept
many
rare
things
his
mother
said
here
too
he
had
his
money
she
added
in
a
whisper
they
had
twice
had
property
left
to
them
she
told
afterwards
they
would
have
one
more
inheritance
besides
if
things
went
as
they
should
but
money
is
not
the
best
thing
in
the
world
after
all
arne
may
get
what
is
far
better
there
were
many
little
trinkets
in
the
room
which
were
interesting
to
examine
and
eli
looked
at
them
all
as
happy
as
a
child
margit
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
saying
as
she
looked
brightly
into
her
eyes
i
have
never
seen
you
before
my
child
but
i
am
already
very
fond
of
you
before
eli
had
time
to
feel
embarrassed
margit
pulled
at
her
dress
and
said
quite
softly
you
see
that
little
red
chest
there
is
something
nice
in
that
i
can
tell
you
eli
looked
at
the
chest
it
was
a
small
square
one
which
she
at
once
longed
to
call
her
own
arne
does
not
want
me
to
know
what
is
in
that
chest
whispered
the
mother
and
he
always
keeps
the
key
hid
she
walked
up
to
some
clothes
hanging
on
the
wall
took
down
a
velvet
waistcoat
felt
in
the
and
there
found
the
key
come
now
you
shall
see
she
whispered
eli
did
not
think
the
mother
was
doing
quite
right
but
women
are
women
and
these
two
now
crossed
softly
over
to
the
chest
and
knelt
in
front
of
it
as
the
mother
raised
the
lid
so
pleasant
a
perfume
rose
toward
them
that
eli
clapped
her
hands
even
before
she
had
seen
anything
spread
over
the
top
was
a
kerchief
which
the
mother
took
away
now
you
shall
see
she
whispered
as
she
took
up
a
fine
black
silk
neckerchief
such
a
one
as
men
do
not
wear
it
looks
just
as
if
it
were
for
a
girl
said
the
mother
here
is
another
she
added
eli
could
not
help
taking
hold
of
this
but
when
the
mother
insisted
upon
trying
it
on
her
she
declined
and
hung
her
head
the
mother
carefully
folded
them
up
again
see
she
then
said
taking
up
some
pretty
silk
ribbons
everything
here
looks
as
if
it
were
meant
for
a
girl
eli
grew
red
as
fire
but
not
a
sound
escaped
her
her
bosom
heaved
her
eyes
had
a
shy
look
otherwise
she
stood
immovable
here
are
more
things
still
the
mother
took
hold
of
a
beautiful
black
dress
pattern
as
she
spoke
this
is
fine
goods
i
dare
say
said
she
as
she
held
it
up
to
the
light
eli
hands
trembled
when
the
mother
asked
her
to
take
hold
of
the
cloth
she
felt
the
blood
rushing
to
her
head
she
would
gladly
have
turned
away
but
this
was
not
easy
to
do
he
has
bought
something
every
time
he
has
been
to
town
said
the
mother
eli
could
scarcely
control
herself
any
longer
her
eyes
roamed
about
the
chest
from
one
article
to
another
and
back
again
to
the
dress
goods
she
in
fact
saw
nothing
else
but
the
mother
persisted
and
the
last
thing
she
took
up
was
wrapped
in
paper
they
slowly
unwrapped
it
this
became
attractive
again
eli
grew
eager
it
proved
to
be
a
pair
of
small
shoes
they
had
never
seen
anything
like
these
either
one
of
them
the
mother
wondered
how
they
could
be
made
eli
said
nothing
but
when
she
went
to
touch
the
shoes
all
her
fingers
made
marks
on
them
she
felt
so
ashamed
that
she
came
very
near
bursting
into
tears
she
longed
most
of
all
to
take
her
leave
but
she
dared
not
speak
nor
dare
she
do
anything
to
make
the
mother
look
up
margit
was
wholly
occupied
with
her
own
thoughts
does
it
not
look
just
as
if
he
had
bought
them
one
by
one
for
some
one
he
had
not
the
courage
to
give
them
to
said
she
as
she
put
each
article
back
in
the
place
where
she
had
found
it
she
must
have
had
practice
in
so
doing
now
let
us
see
what
there
is
in
this
little
box
she
added
softly
opening
it
as
though
now
they
were
going
to
find
something
really
choice
there
lay
a
buckle
broad
enough
for
a
belt
that
was
the
first
thing
she
showed
eli
the
next
was
two
gold
rings
tied
together
and
then
the
girl
caught
sight
of
a
velvet
with
silver
clasps
further
she
could
not
look
for
on
the
silver
of
the
book
was
engraved
in
small
letters
eli
baardsdatter
böen
margit
called
her
attention
to
something
got
no
reply
but
saw
that
tear
after
tear
was
trickling
down
on
the
silk
kerchief
and
spreading
over
it
then
the
mother
laid
down
the
brooch
she
held
in
her
hand
closed
the
little
box
turned
round
and
clasped
eli
in
her
arms
the
daughter
wept
on
her
shoulder
and
the
mother
wept
over
her
but
neither
of
them
spoke
a
word
a
little
while
later
eli
was
walking
alone
in
the
garden
the
mother
had
gone
into
the
kitchen
to
prepare
something
good
for
supper
for
now
arne
would
soon
be
home
by
and
by
margit
came
out
into
the
garden
to
look
for
her
young
friend
and
found
her
sitting
writing
in
the
sand
as
the
mother
joined
her
eli
quickly
smoothed
the
sand
over
what
she
had
written
looked
up
and
smiled
she
had
been
weeping
there
is
nothing
to
cry
about
my
child
said
margit
and
gave
her
a
pat
they
saw
a
black
object
moving
between
the
bushes
on
the
road
eli
stole
into
the
house
the
mother
followed
her
here
a
bounteous
repast
was
awaiting
them
cream
pudding
smoked
meat
and
cakes
but
eli
had
no
eyes
for
these
things
she
crossed
the
floor
to
the
corner
where
the
clock
stood
sat
down
on
a
chair
close
to
the
wall
and
trembled
if
she
only
heard
a
cat
stir
the
mother
stood
by
the
table
firm
steps
were
heard
on
the
a
short
light
step
in
the
passage
the
door
was
gently
opened
and
arne
came
in
the
first
object
his
eyes
lighted
on
was
eli
in
the
clock
corner
he
let
go
of
the
door
and
stood
still
this
made
eli
yet
more
embarrassed
she
got
up
regretted
at
once
having
done
so
and
turned
towards
the
wall
are
here
said
arne
softly
blushing
crimson
eli
shaded
her
eyes
with
one
hand
as
one
does
when
the
sun
shines
too
full
in
the
face
how
he
could
get
no
farther
but
he
advanced
a
step
or
two
she
put
her
hand
down
again
turned
toward
him
then
bowing
her
head
she
burst
into
tears
god
bless
you
eli
said
he
and
drew
his
arm
around
her
she
nestled
close
up
to
him
he
whispered
something
in
her
ear
she
made
no
reply
but
clasped
her
hands
about
his
neck
they
stood
thus
for
a
long
time
and
not
a
sound
was
heard
save
the
roar
of
the
force
sending
forth
its
eternal
song
by
and
by
some
one
was
heard
weeping
near
the
table
arne
looked
up
it
was
the
mother
now
i
am
sure
you
will
not
leave
me
arne
said
she
approaching
him
she
wept
freely
but
it
did
her
good
she
said
when
arne
and
eli
walked
home
together
in
the
bright
summer
evening
they
did
not
talk
much
about
their
happiness
they
let
nature
herself
take
the
lead
in
the
conversation
so
quiet
bright
and
grand
she
seemed
as
she
accompanied
them
but
it
was
on
his
way
back
to
kampen
from
this
their
first
walk
with
his
face
turned
toward
the
rising
sun
that
he
laid
the
foundations
of
a
poem
which
he
was
then
in
no
frame
of
mind
to
construct
but
which
later
when
it
was
finished
became
for
a
while
his
daily
song
it
ran
thus
i
hoped
to
become
something
great
one
day
i
thought
it
would
be
when
i
got
away
each
thought
that
my
bosom
entered
on
journeys
was
centred
a
maiden
then
into
my
eyes
did
look
my
rovings
soon
lost
their
pleasure
the
loftiest
aim
my
heart
can
brook
is
her
to
proclaim
my
treasure
i
hoped
to
become
something
great
one
day
i
thought
it
would
be
when
i
got
away
to
meet
with
the
great
in
learning
intensely
my
heart
was
yearning
she
taught
me
she
did
for
she
spoke
a
word
best
gift
of
god
bestowing
is
not
to
be
called
a
distinguished
lord
but
ever
a
to
be
growing
i
hoped
to
become
something
great
one
day
i
thought
it
would
be
when
i
got
away
my
home
seemed
so
cold
neglected
i
felt
like
a
stranger
suspected
when
her
i
discovered
then
love
i
did
see
in
every
glance
that
found
me
wherever
i
turned
friends
waited
for
me
and
life
became
new
around
me
there
came
afterwards
many
a
summer
evening
walk
followed
by
many
a
song
one
of
these
must
be
recorded
the
cause
of
this
all
is
beyond
my
knowing
no
storm
there
has
been
and
no
floods
have
been
flowing
a
sparkling
and
glittering
brook
it
would
seem
has
poured
itself
into
the
broader
stream
which
constantly
growing
seeks
the
ocean
there
is
something
we
can
from
our
lives
not
sever
in
need
it
is
near
and
forsakes
us
never
a
power
that
draws
a
loving
breast
which
sadness
shyness
and
all
unrest
can
gather
in
peace
in
a
bridal
present
could
i
but
by
spirits
through
life
be
attended
as
pure
as
the
thought
which
has
now
me
befriended
the
ordering
spirit
of
god
it
was
he
ruleth
the
world
with
sacred
laws
toward
goodness
eternal
i
am
progressing
but
perhaps
none
of
them
better
expressed
his
fervent
gratitude
than
the
following
the
power
that
gave
me
my
little
song
has
caused
that
as
rain
has
been
my
sadness
and
that
as
sunshine
has
been
my
gladness
the
wants
of
my
soul
along
betided
it
did
no
harm
my
song
all
guided
to
love
so
warm
the
power
that
gave
me
my
little
song
has
given
me
friendship
for
all
that
yearning
for
freedom
blessings
my
blood
is
burning
the
foe
i
am
of
every
wrong
i
sought
my
station
spite
every
storm
and
found
salvation
in
love
so
warm
the
power
that
gave
me
my
little
song
must
make
me
able
to
sing
the
others
and
now
and
then
to
make
glad
my
brothers
whom
i
may
meet
in
the
worldly
throng
for
there
was
never
a
sweeter
charm
than
singing
ever
in
love
so
warm
chapter
xvi
it
was
late
in
the
autumn
the
harvesters
were
at
work
housing
the
grain
the
day
was
clear
it
had
rained
during
the
night
and
in
the
morning
therefore
the
air
was
as
mild
as
in
it
was
a
saturday
and
yet
many
boats
were
making
their
way
across
black
water
toward
the
church
the
men
in
their
shirt
sleeves
were
rowing
the
women
sat
in
the
stern
with
kerchiefs
on
their
heads
a
still
greater
number
of
boats
were
steering
over
to
böen
in
order
to
move
away
from
there
later
in
grand
procession
for
on
this
day
baard
böen
gave
a
wedding
for
his
daughter
eli
and
arne
nils
son
kampen
all
the
doors
were
open
people
were
going
in
and
out
children
with
pieces
of
cake
in
their
hands
stood
about
the
yard
afraid
of
their
new
clothes
and
looking
shyly
at
one
another
an
old
woman
sat
upon
the
steps
alone
it
was
margit
kampen
she
wore
a
large
silver
ring
with
several
small
rings
fastened
to
the
upper
silver
plate
now
and
then
she
looked
at
it
nils
had
given
it
to
her
the
day
of
their
wedding
and
she
had
never
worn
it
since
the
man
who
presided
at
the
feast
and
the
two
young
groomsmen
the
priest
son
and
eli
brother
went
about
in
the
two
or
three
rooms
offering
refreshments
to
the
wedding
guests
as
they
arrived
to
be
present
on
this
great
occasion
in
eli
room
were
the
bride
the
priest
wife
and
mathilde
the
had
come
from
town
for
the
sole
purpose
of
decking
the
bride
this
the
girls
had
promised
each
other
from
their
childhood
arne
wearing
a
broadcloth
suit
with
roundabout
and
with
a
collar
that
eli
had
made
stood
in
one
of
the
rooms
by
the
window
on
which
eli
had
written
arne
outside
in
the
passage
two
persons
met
as
they
came
each
from
some
duty
of
the
day
one
of
them
was
on
his
way
from
the
where
he
had
been
helping
to
put
the
church
boats
in
order
he
wore
a
black
broadcloth
roundabout
with
blue
wadmal
trousers
whose
dye
rubbed
off
so
that
his
hands
were
blue
his
white
collar
looked
well
with
his
fair
face
and
long
light
hair
his
high
forehead
was
calm
about
the
mouth
played
a
smile
it
was
baard
she
whom
he
met
in
the
passage
was
just
coming
from
the
kitchen
she
was
dressed
for
church
was
tall
and
slender
and
walked
with
a
firm
though
hurried
step
through
the
door
when
she
met
baard
she
paused
and
her
mouth
drew
up
to
one
side
it
was
birgit
his
wife
each
had
something
to
say
but
it
only
found
expression
through
both
standing
still
baard
was
the
most
embarrassed
of
the
two
he
smiled
more
and
more
but
it
was
his
embarrassment
that
came
to
his
aid
forcing
him
to
start
without
further
delay
perhaps
you
will
come
too
he
said
as
he
passed
and
birgit
followed
him
in
the
garret
they
were
entirely
alone
yet
baard
locked
the
door
after
them
and
he
was
a
long
time
about
it
when
finally
he
turned
birgit
stood
by
the
window
gazing
out
it
was
in
order
to
avoid
looking
into
the
room
baard
brought
forth
a
small
flask
from
his
breast
pocket
and
a
little
silver
cup
he
wanted
to
pour
out
some
wine
for
his
wife
but
she
would
not
have
any
although
he
assured
her
that
it
was
wine
that
had
been
sent
from
the
parsonage
then
he
drank
himself
but
paused
several
times
to
offer
the
cup
to
her
he
corked
the
flask
put
both
it
and
the
cup
away
in
his
again
and
sat
down
on
a
chest
it
very
evidently
pained
him
that
his
wife
would
not
drink
with
him
he
breathed
heavily
several
times
birgit
stood
leaning
with
one
hand
against
the
window
frame
baard
had
something
to
say
but
now
it
seemed
even
harder
to
speak
than
before
birgit
said
he
i
dare
say
you
are
thinking
of
the
same
that
i
am
then
he
heard
her
move
from
one
side
of
the
window
to
the
other
and
again
she
leaned
her
head
on
her
arm
oh
yes
you
know
who
i
mean
he
it
was
who
parted
us
two
i
thought
it
would
not
go
beyond
the
wedding
but
it
has
lasted
much
longer
he
heard
her
sigh
he
saw
her
again
change
her
place
but
he
did
not
see
her
face
he
himself
was
struggling
so
hard
that
he
had
to
wipe
his
face
with
his
jacket
sleeve
after
a
long
conflict
he
began
again
a
son
of
his
and
handsome
becomes
one
of
us
and
to
him
we
have
given
our
only
daughter
now
how
would
it
be
birgit
if
we
two
were
to
have
our
wedding
his
voice
trembled
and
he
cleared
his
throat
birgit
who
had
raised
her
head
now
leaned
it
on
her
arm
again
but
said
nothing
baard
waited
for
some
time
he
heard
her
breathe
but
he
got
no
answer
and
he
had
nothing
further
to
say
himself
either
he
looked
up
and
grew
very
pale
for
she
did
not
even
turn
her
head
then
he
rose
at
the
same
moment
there
was
a
gentle
knock
at
the
door
and
a
soft
voice
asked
are
you
coming
mother
it
was
eli
there
was
something
in
the
tone
that
made
baard
involuntarily
pause
and
glance
at
birgit
birgit
also
raised
her
head
she
looked
towards
the
door
and
her
eyes
fell
on
baard
pale
face
are
you
coming
mother
was
once
more
asked
from
without
yes
i
am
coming
now
said
birgit
in
a
broken
voice
as
she
firmly
crossed
the
floor
to
where
baard
stood
gave
him
her
hand
and
burst
into
the
most
passionate
weeping
the
two
hands
met
they
were
both
now
but
they
clasped
as
firmly
as
though
they
had
been
seeking
each
other
for
twenty
years
they
still
clung
together
as
they
went
toward
the
door
and
when
a
while
later
the
bridal
procession
was
passing
down
to
the
and
arne
gave
his
hand
to
eli
to
take
the
lead
baard
seeing
it
took
his
wife
by
the
hand
contrary
to
all
custom
and
followed
them
smiling
contentedly
behind
them
margit
kampen
walked
alone
as
was
her
wont
baard
was
in
high
spirits
that
day
he
sat
talking
with
the
rowers
one
of
these
who
kept
looking
up
at
the
mountains
remarked
that
it
was
strange
that
even
such
a
steep
rock
could
be
clad
it
must
whether
it
would
or
no
said
baard
and
his
eyes
wandered
all
along
the
procession
until
they
rested
on
the
bridal
pair
and
his
wife
who
could
have
foretold
this
twenty
years
ago
said
he
early
tales
and
sketches
the
railroad
and
the
churchyard
chapter
knud
aakre
belonged
to
an
old
family
in
the
parish
where
it
had
always
been
renowned
for
its
intelligence
and
its
devotion
to
the
public
welfare
his
father
had
worked
his
way
up
to
the
priesthood
but
had
died
early
and
as
the
widow
came
from
a
peasant
stock
the
children
were
brought
up
as
peasants
knud
had
therefore
received
only
the
education
afforded
by
the
public
schools
of
his
day
but
his
library
had
early
inspired
him
with
a
love
of
knowledge
this
was
further
stimulated
by
his
friend
henrik
wergeland
who
frequently
visited
him
sent
him
books
seeds
and
much
valuable
counsel
following
some
of
the
latter
knud
early
founded
a
club
which
in
the
beginning
had
a
very
miscellaneous
object
for
instance
to
give
the
members
practice
in
debating
and
to
study
the
constitution
but
which
later
was
turned
into
a
practical
agricultural
society
for
the
entire
bailiwick
according
to
wergeland
advice
he
also
founded
a
parish
library
giving
his
father
books
as
its
first
endowment
a
suggestion
from
the
same
quarter
led
him
to
start
a
on
his
gard
for
those
who
might
wish
to
learn
writing
arithmetic
and
history
all
this
drew
attention
to
him
so
that
he
was
elected
member
of
the
parish
board
of
supervisors
of
which
he
soon
became
chairman
in
this
capacity
he
took
a
deep
interest
in
the
schools
which
he
brought
into
a
remarkably
good
condition
knud
aakre
was
a
short
man
brisk
in
his
movements
with
small
restless
eyes
and
very
disorderly
hair
he
had
large
lips
which
were
in
constant
motion
and
a
row
of
splendid
teeth
which
always
seemed
to
be
working
with
them
for
they
glistened
while
his
words
were
snapped
out
crisp
and
clear
crackling
like
sparks
from
a
great
fire
foremost
among
the
many
he
had
helped
to
gain
an
education
was
his
neighbor
lars
högstad
lars
was
not
much
younger
than
knud
but
he
had
developed
more
slowly
knud
liked
to
talk
about
what
he
read
and
thought
and
he
found
in
lars
whose
manner
was
quiet
and
grave
a
good
listener
who
by
degrees
grew
to
be
a
man
of
excellent
judgment
the
relations
between
them
soon
became
such
that
knud
was
never
willing
to
take
any
important
step
without
first
consulting
lars
högstad
and
the
matter
on
hand
was
thus
likely
to
gain
some
practical
amendment
so
knud
drew
his
neighbor
into
the
board
of
supervisors
and
gradually
into
everything
in
which
he
himself
took
part
they
always
drove
together
to
the
meetings
of
the
board
where
lars
never
spoke
but
on
the
way
back
and
forth
knud
learned
his
opinions
the
two
were
looked
upon
as
inseparable
one
fine
autumn
day
the
board
of
supervisors
convened
to
consider
among
other
things
a
proposal
from
the
bailiff
to
sell
the
parish
grain
magazine
and
with
the
proceeds
establish
a
small
knud
aakre
the
chairman
would
undoubtedly
have
approved
this
measure
had
he
relied
on
his
unbiased
judgment
but
he
was
prejudiced
partly
because
the
proposal
came
from
the
bailiff
whom
wergeland
did
not
like
and
who
was
consequently
no
favorite
of
knud
either
and
partly
because
the
grain
magazine
had
been
built
by
his
influential
paternal
grandfather
and
by
him
presented
to
the
parish
indeed
knud
was
rather
inclined
to
view
the
proposition
as
a
personal
insult
therefore
he
had
not
spoken
of
it
to
any
one
not
even
to
lars
and
the
latter
never
entered
on
a
topic
that
had
not
first
been
set
afloat
by
some
one
else
as
chairman
knud
aakre
read
the
proposal
without
adding
any
comments
but
as
was
his
wont
his
eyes
sought
lars
who
usually
sat
or
stood
a
little
aside
holding
a
straw
between
his
teeth
he
always
had
one
when
he
took
part
in
a
conversation
he
either
used
it
as
a
or
he
let
it
hang
loosely
in
one
corner
of
his
mouth
turning
it
more
rapidly
or
more
slowly
according
to
the
mood
he
was
in
to
his
surprise
knud
saw
that
the
straw
was
moving
very
fast
do
you
think
we
should
agree
to
this
he
asked
quickly
lars
answered
dryly
yes
i
do
the
whole
board
feeling
that
knud
held
quite
a
different
opinion
looked
in
astonishment
at
lars
but
the
latter
said
no
more
nor
was
he
further
questioned
knud
turned
to
another
matter
as
though
nothing
had
transpired
not
until
the
close
of
the
meeting
did
he
resume
the
subject
and
then
asked
with
apparent
indifference
if
it
would
not
be
well
to
send
the
proposal
back
to
the
bailiff
for
further
consideration
as
it
certainly
did
not
meet
the
views
of
the
people
for
the
parish
valued
the
grain
magazine
no
one
replied
knud
asked
whether
he
should
enter
the
resolution
in
the
register
the
measure
did
not
seem
to
be
a
wise
one
against
one
vote
added
lars
against
two
cried
another
promptly
against
three
came
from
a
third
and
before
the
chairman
could
realize
what
was
taking
place
a
majority
had
voted
in
favor
of
the
proposal
knud
was
so
surprised
that
he
forgot
to
offer
any
opposition
he
recorded
the
proceedings
and
read
in
a
low
voice
the
measure
is
recommended
adjourned
his
face
was
fiery
red
as
he
rose
and
put
up
the
but
he
determined
to
bring
forward
the
question
once
more
at
the
meeting
of
the
representatives
out
in
the
yard
he
put
his
horse
to
the
wagon
and
lars
came
and
took
his
seat
at
his
side
they
discussed
various
topics
on
their
way
home
but
not
the
one
they
had
nearest
at
heart
the
next
day
knud
wife
sought
lars
wife
to
inquire
if
there
was
anything
wrong
between
the
two
men
for
knud
had
acted
so
strangely
when
he
came
home
a
short
distance
above
the
gard
buildings
she
met
wife
who
was
on
her
way
to
ask
the
same
question
for
her
husband
too
had
been
out
of
sorts
the
day
before
lars
wife
was
a
quiet
bashful
person
somewhat
cowed
not
by
harsh
words
but
by
silence
for
lars
never
spoke
to
her
unless
she
had
done
something
amiss
or
he
feared
that
she
might
do
wrong
knud
aakre
wife
on
the
other
hand
talked
more
with
her
husband
and
particularly
about
the
board
for
lately
it
had
taken
his
thoughts
work
and
affection
away
from
her
and
the
children
she
was
as
jealous
of
it
as
of
a
woman
she
wept
at
night
over
the
board
and
quarreled
with
her
husband
about
it
during
the
day
but
for
that
very
reason
she
could
say
nothing
about
it
now
when
for
once
he
had
returned
home
unhappy
for
she
immediately
became
more
wretched
than
he
and
for
her
life
she
could
not
rest
until
she
had
discovered
what
was
the
matter
consequently
when
lars
wife
could
not
give
her
the
desired
information
she
had
to
go
out
in
the
parish
to
seek
it
here
she
obtained
it
and
of
course
was
at
once
of
her
husband
opinion
she
found
lars
incomprehensible
not
to
say
wicked
when
however
she
let
her
husband
perceive
this
she
felt
that
as
yet
there
was
no
breach
between
lars
and
him
that
on
the
contrary
he
clung
warmly
to
him
the
representatives
met
lars
högstad
drove
over
to
aakre
in
the
morning
knud
came
out
of
the
house
and
took
his
seat
beside
him
they
exchanged
the
usual
greetings
spoke
perhaps
rather
less
than
was
their
wont
on
the
way
and
not
of
the
proposal
all
the
members
of
the
board
were
present
some
too
had
found
their
way
in
as
spectators
which
knud
did
not
like
for
it
showed
that
there
was
a
stir
in
town
about
the
matter
lars
was
armed
with
his
straw
and
he
stood
by
the
stove
warming
himself
for
the
autumn
was
beginning
to
be
cold
the
chairman
read
the
proposal
in
a
subdued
cautious
manner
remarking
when
he
was
through
that
it
must
be
remembered
this
came
from
the
bailiff
who
was
not
apt
to
be
very
felicitous
in
his
propositions
the
building
it
was
well
known
was
a
gift
and
it
is
not
customary
to
part
with
gifts
least
of
all
when
there
is
no
need
of
doing
so
lars
who
never
before
had
spoken
at
the
meetings
now
took
the
floor
to
the
astonishment
of
all
his
voice
trembled
but
whether
it
did
so
out
of
regard
for
knud
or
from
anxiety
lest
his
own
cause
should
be
lost
shall
remain
unsaid
but
his
arguments
were
good
and
clear
and
full
of
a
logic
and
confidence
which
had
scarcely
been
heard
at
these
meetings
before
and
when
he
had
gone
over
all
the
ground
he
added
in
conclusion
what
does
it
matter
if
the
proposal
does
come
from
the
bailiff
this
affects
the
question
as
little
as
who
erected
the
building
or
in
what
way
it
came
into
the
public
possession
knud
aakre
had
grown
very
red
in
the
face
he
blushed
easily
and
he
shifted
uneasily
from
side
to
side
as
was
his
wont
when
he
was
impatient
but
none
the
less
did
he
exert
himself
to
be
circumspect
and
to
speak
in
a
low
voice
there
were
enough
in
the
country
he
thought
and
quite
near
at
hand
he
might
almost
say
near
but
if
after
all
it
was
deemed
expedient
to
have
one
there
were
surely
other
ways
of
reaching
it
than
those
leading
over
the
gifts
of
the
dead
and
the
love
of
the
living
his
voice
was
a
little
unsteady
when
he
said
this
but
quickly
recovered
as
he
proceeded
to
speak
of
the
grain
magazine
in
itself
and
to
show
what
its
advantages
were
lars
answered
him
thoroughly
on
the
last
point
and
then
added
however
one
thing
and
another
lead
me
to
doubt
whether
this
parish
is
managed
for
the
sake
of
the
living
or
the
dead
furthermore
whether
it
is
the
love
and
hatred
of
a
single
family
which
controls
matters
here
or
the
good
of
the
whole
knud
answered
quickly
i
do
not
know
whether
he
who
has
just
spoken
has
been
least
benefited
by
this
family
both
by
the
dead
and
by
him
who
now
lives
the
first
shot
was
aimed
at
the
fact
that
knud
powerful
grandfather
had
saved
the
gard
for
lars
paternal
grandfather
when
the
latter
on
his
part
was
absent
on
a
little
excursion
to
the
penitentiary
the
straw
which
long
had
been
in
brisk
motion
suddenly
became
still
it
is
not
my
way
to
keep
talking
everywhere
about
myself
and
my
family
said
lars
then
turned
again
with
calm
superiority
to
the
subject
under
discussion
briefly
reviewing
all
the
points
with
one
definite
object
knud
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
had
never
viewed
the
matter
from
such
a
broad
standpoint
involuntarily
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
at
lars
who
stood
before
him
tall
heavily
built
with
clearness
on
the
vigorous
brow
and
in
the
deep
eyes
the
lips
were
tightly
compressed
the
straw
still
played
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
all
the
surrounding
lines
indicated
vigor
he
kept
his
hands
behind
him
and
stood
rigidly
erect
while
his
voice
was
as
deep
and
as
hollow
as
if
it
proceeded
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
knud
saw
him
as
he
was
and
in
his
inmost
soul
he
was
afraid
of
him
for
this
man
must
always
have
been
his
superior
he
had
taken
all
knud
himself
knew
and
could
impart
he
had
rejected
the
tares
and
retained
what
had
produced
this
strong
hidden
growth
he
had
been
fostered
and
loved
by
knud
but
had
now
become
a
giant
who
hated
knud
deeply
terribly
knud
could
not
explain
to
himself
why
but
as
he
looked
at
lars
he
instinctively
felt
this
to
be
so
and
all
else
becoming
swallowed
up
in
this
thought
he
started
up
exclaiming
but
lars
lars
what
in
heaven
name
is
the
matter
with
you
his
agitation
overcame
him
you
whom
i
have
you
who
have
powerless
to
utter
another
word
he
sat
down
but
in
his
effort
to
gain
the
mastery
over
the
emotion
he
deemed
lars
unworthy
of
seeing
he
brought
his
fist
down
with
violence
on
the
table
while
his
eyes
flashed
beneath
his
stiff
disorderly
hair
which
always
hung
over
them
lars
acted
as
if
he
had
not
been
interrupted
and
turning
toward
the
others
he
asked
if
this
was
to
be
the
decisive
blow
for
if
such
were
the
case
there
was
no
need
for
further
remarks
this
calmness
was
more
than
knud
could
endure
what
is
it
that
has
come
among
us
cried
he
we
who
have
until
been
actuated
by
love
and
zeal
alone
are
now
stirred
up
against
each
other
as
though
goaded
on
by
some
evil
spirit
and
he
cast
a
fiery
glance
at
lars
who
replied
it
must
be
you
yourself
who
bring
in
this
spirit
knud
for
i
have
kept
strictly
to
the
matter
before
us
but
you
never
can
see
the
advantage
of
anything
you
do
not
want
yourself
now
we
shall
learn
what
becomes
of
the
love
and
the
zeal
when
once
this
matter
is
decided
as
we
wish
have
i
then
illy
served
the
interests
of
the
parish
there
was
no
reply
this
grieved
knud
and
he
continued
i
really
did
persuade
myself
that
i
had
accomplished
various
things
various
things
which
have
been
of
advantage
to
the
parish
but
perhaps
i
have
deceived
myself
he
was
again
overcome
by
his
feelings
for
his
was
a
fiery
nature
ever
variable
in
its
moods
and
the
breach
with
lars
pained
him
so
deeply
that
he
could
scarcely
control
himself
lars
answered
yes
i
know
you
appropriate
the
credit
for
all
that
is
done
here
and
if
one
should
judge
by
the
amount
of
speaking
at
these
meetings
you
certainly
have
accomplished
the
most
is
that
the
way
of
it
shouted
knud
looking
sharply
at
lars
it
is
you
who
deserve
the
entire
honor
since
we
must
finally
talk
about
ourselves
said
lars
i
am
free
to
admit
that
every
question
has
been
carefully
considered
by
both
of
us
before
it
was
introduced
here
here
little
knud
aakre
regained
his
ready
speech
take
the
honor
in
god
name
i
am
quite
able
to
live
without
it
there
are
other
things
that
are
harder
to
lose
involuntarily
lars
evaded
his
gaze
but
said
as
he
set
the
straw
in
very
rapid
motion
if
i
were
to
express
opinion
i
should
say
that
there
is
not
very
much
to
take
credit
for
no
doubt
the
priest
and
the
are
content
with
what
has
been
done
but
certainly
the
common
people
say
that
up
to
the
present
time
the
taxes
of
this
parish
have
grown
heavier
and
heavier
here
arose
a
murmur
in
the
crowd
and
the
people
grew
very
restless
lars
continued
finally
we
have
a
matter
brought
before
us
that
might
make
the
parish
some
little
amends
for
all
it
has
paid
out
this
is
perhaps
the
reason
why
it
encounters
such
opposition
this
is
a
question
which
concerns
the
parish
it
is
for
the
welfare
of
all
it
is
our
duty
to
protect
it
from
becoming
a
mere
family
matter
people
exchanged
glances
and
spoke
in
tones
one
of
them
remarked
as
he
rose
to
go
for
his
that
these
were
the
truest
words
he
had
heard
in
these
meetings
for
many
years
now
all
rose
from
their
seats
the
conversation
became
general
and
knud
aakre
who
alone
remained
sitting
felt
that
all
was
lost
fearfully
lost
and
made
no
further
effort
to
save
it
the
truth
was
he
possessed
something
of
the
temperament
attributed
to
frenchmen
he
was
very
good
at
a
first
second
or
even
third
attack
but
poor
at
for
his
sensibilities
overwhelmed
his
thoughts
he
was
unable
to
comprehend
this
nor
could
he
sit
still
any
longer
and
so
resigning
his
place
to
the
he
left
the
others
could
not
refrain
from
a
smile
he
had
come
to
the
meeting
in
company
with
lars
but
went
home
alone
although
the
way
was
long
it
was
a
cold
autumn
day
the
forest
was
jagged
and
bare
the
meadow
frost
was
beginning
here
and
there
to
remain
on
the
disappointment
is
a
terrible
companion
knud
felt
so
small
so
desolate
as
he
walked
along
but
lars
appeared
everywhere
before
him
towering
up
to
the
sky
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
like
a
giant
it
vexed
him
to
think
it
was
his
own
fault
that
this
had
been
the
decisive
battle
he
had
staked
too
much
on
one
single
little
issue
but
surprise
pain
anger
had
mastered
him
they
still
burned
tingled
moaned
and
stormed
within
him
he
heard
the
rumbling
of
behind
him
it
was
lars
driving
his
superb
horse
past
him
in
a
brisk
trot
making
the
hard
road
resound
like
distant
thunder
knud
watched
the
form
that
sat
erect
in
the
cart
while
the
horse
eager
for
home
sped
onward
without
any
effort
on
the
part
of
lars
who
merely
gave
him
a
loose
rein
it
was
but
a
picture
of
this
man
power
he
was
driving
onward
to
the
goal
knud
felt
himself
cast
out
of
his
cart
to
stagger
on
alone
in
the
chill
autumn
air
in
his
home
at
aakre
knud
wife
was
waiting
for
him
she
knew
that
a
battle
was
inevitable
she
had
never
in
her
life
trusted
lars
and
now
she
was
positively
afraid
of
him
it
had
been
no
comfort
to
her
that
he
and
her
husband
had
driven
away
together
it
would
not
have
consoled
her
had
they
returned
in
the
same
way
but
darkness
had
fallen
and
they
had
not
come
she
stood
in
the
doorway
gazing
out
on
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
she
walked
down
the
hill
and
back
again
but
no
cart
appeared
finally
she
hears
a
rattling
on
the
hard
road
her
heart
throbs
as
the
wheels
go
round
she
clings
to
the
casement
peering
out
into
the
night
the
cart
draws
near
only
one
is
in
it
she
recognizes
lars
who
sees
and
recognizes
her
but
drives
past
without
stopping
now
she
became
thoroughly
alarmed
her
limbs
gave
way
under
her
she
tottered
in
and
sank
down
on
the
bench
by
the
window
the
children
gathered
anxiously
about
her
the
youngest
one
asked
for
papa
she
never
spoke
with
them
but
of
him
he
had
such
a
noble
disposition
and
this
was
what
made
her
love
him
but
now
his
heart
was
not
with
his
family
it
was
engrossed
in
all
sorts
of
business
which
brought
him
only
unhappiness
and
consequently
they
were
all
unhappy
if
only
no
misfortune
had
befallen
him
knud
was
so
why
had
lars
come
home
alone
why
did
he
not
stop
should
she
run
after
him
or
down
the
road
after
her
husband
she
was
in
an
agony
of
distress
and
the
children
pressed
around
her
asking
what
was
the
matter
but
this
she
would
not
tell
them
so
rising
she
said
they
must
eat
supper
alone
then
got
everything
ready
and
helped
them
all
the
while
she
kept
glancing
out
on
the
road
he
did
not
come
she
undressed
the
children
and
put
them
to
bed
and
the
youngest
repeated
the
evening
prayer
while
she
bowed
over
him
she
herself
prayed
with
such
fervor
in
the
words
which
the
infant
lips
so
soothingly
uttered
that
she
did
not
heed
the
steps
outside
knud
stood
upon
the
threshold
gazing
at
his
little
company
at
prayer
the
mother
drew
herself
up
all
the
children
shouted
papa
but
he
seated
himself
at
once
and
said
softly
oh
let
him
say
it
once
more
the
mother
turned
again
to
the
bedside
that
he
meanwhile
should
not
see
her
face
for
it
would
have
seemed
like
intruding
on
his
grief
before
he
felt
the
need
of
revealing
it
the
little
one
folded
its
hands
over
its
breast
all
the
rest
did
likewise
and
it
repeated
i
a
little
child
pray
heaven
that
my
sins
may
be
forgiven
with
time
i
larger
wiser
grow
and
my
father
and
mother
joy
shall
know
if
only
thou
dearest
dearest
lord
will
help
me
to
keep
thy
precious
word
and
now
to
our
heavenly
father
merciful
keeping
our
souls
let
us
trust
while
we
sleeping
what
peace
now
fell
upon
the
room
not
a
minute
had
elapsed
ere
all
the
children
were
sleeping
as
in
the
arms
of
god
but
the
mother
moved
softly
away
and
placed
supper
before
the
father
who
was
however
unable
to
eat
but
after
he
had
gone
to
bed
he
said
henceforth
i
shall
be
at
home
and
his
wife
lay
at
his
side
trembling
with
joy
which
she
dared
not
betray
and
she
thanked
god
for
all
that
had
happened
for
whatever
it
might
be
it
had
resulted
in
good
chapter

in
the
course
of
a
year
lars
had
become
chairman
of
the
parish
board
of
supervisors
president
of
the
and
leading
commissioner
in
the
court
of
reconciliation
in
short
he
held
every
office
to
which
his
election
had
been
possible
in
the
board
of
supervisors
for
the
amt
county
he
was
silent
during
the
first
year
but
the
second
year
he
created
the
same
sensation
when
he
spoke
as
in
the
parish
board
for
here
too
coming
forward
in
opposition
to
him
who
had
previously
been
the
guiding
power
he
became
victorious
over
the
entire
rank
and
file
and
was
from
that
time
himself
the
leader
from
this
his
path
led
him
to
the
storthing
parliament
where
his
fame
had
preceded
him
and
where
consequently
there
was
no
lack
of
challenges
but
here
although
steady
and
firm
he
always
remained
retiring
he
did
not
care
for
power
except
where
he
was
well
known
nor
would
he
endanger
his
leadership
at
home
by
a
possible
defeat
abroad
for
he
had
a
pleasant
life
at
home
when
he
stood
by
the
church
wall
on
sundays
and
the
congregation
walked
slowly
past
saluting
him
and
stealing
side
glances
at
him
and
one
after
another
paused
in
order
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
him
then
truly
it
might
be
said
that
he
controlled
the
entire
parish
with
a
straw
for
of
course
this
hung
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
he
deserved
his
honors
the
road
leading
to
the
church
he
had
opened
the
new
church
they
were
standing
beside
he
had
built
this
and
much
more
was
the
fruit
of
the
which
he
had
founded
and
now
managed
himself
for
its
resources
were
further
made
fruitful
and
the
parish
was
constantly
held
up
as
an
example
to
all
others
of
and
good
order
knud
aakre
had
entirely
withdrawn
from
the
field
although
at
first
he
attended
a
few
of
the
meetings
of
the
board
because
he
had
promised
himself
that
he
would
continue
to
offer
his
services
even
if
it
were
not
altogether
pleasing
to
his
pride
in
the
first
proposal
he
had
made
he
became
so
greatly
perplexed
by
lars
who
insisted
upon
having
it
represented
in
all
its
details
that
somewhat
hurt
he
said
when
columbus
discovered
america
he
did
not
have
it
divided
into
parishes
and
deaneries
this
came
gradually
whereupon
lars
in
his
reply
compared
the
discovery
of
america
with
knud
proposal
it
so
happened
that
this
treated
of
stable
improvements
and
afterwards
knud
was
known
by
no
other
name
in
the
board
than
discovery
of
america
so
knud
thought
that
as
his
usefulness
had
ceased
so
too
had
his
obligations
to
work
and
he
refused
to
accept
further
reëlections
but
he
continued
to
be
industrious
and
in
order
that
he
might
still
have
a
field
for
usefulness
he
enlarged
his
and
placed
it
by
means
of
small
contributions
from
the
attendants
in
communication
with
the
mission
cause
of
which
he
soon
became
the
centre
and
leader
in
his
own
and
the
surrounding
counties
thereupon
lars
högstad
remarked
that
if
ever
knud
undertook
to
collect
money
for
any
purpose
he
must
know
beforehand
that
it
was
to
do
good
thousands
of
miles
from
home
there
was
be
it
observed
no
more
strife
between
them
to
be
sure
they
no
longer
associated
with
each
other
but
they
bowed
and
spoke
when
they
met
knud
always
felt
a
little
pain
at
the
mere
thought
of
lars
but
strove
to
suppress
it
and
persuade
himself
that
matters
could
not
have
been
otherwise
at
a
large
many
years
afterward
where
both
were
present
and
both
were
in
good
spirits
knud
mounted
a
chair
and
proposed
a
toast
for
the
chairman
of
the
parish
board
and
the
first
representative
their
amt
had
sent
to
the
storthing
he
spoke
until
he
became
deeply
moved
and
as
usual
expressed
himself
in
an
exceedingly
handsome
way
every
one
thought
it
was
honorably
done
and
lars
came
up
to
him
and
his
gaze
was
unsteady
as
he
said
that
for
much
of
what
he
knew
and
was
he
was
indebted
to
him
at
the
next
election
of
the
board
of
supervisors
knud
was
again
made
chairman
but
had
lars
högstad
foreseen
what
now
followed
he
would
certainly
not
have
used
his
influence
for
this
every
event
happens
in
its
own
time
says
an
old
proverb
and
just
as
knud
aakre
again
entered
the
board
the
best
men
of
the
parish
were
threatened
with
ruin
as
the
result
of
a
speculation
craze
which
had
long
been
raging
but
which
now
first
began
to
demand
its
victims
it
was
said
that
lars
högstad
was
the
cause
of
this
great
disaster
for
he
had
taught
the
parish
to
speculate
this
penny
fever
had
originated
in
the
parish
board
of
supervisors
for
the
board
itself
was
the
greatest
speculator
of
all
every
one
down
to
the
laboring
youth
of
twenty
years
desired
in
his
transactions
to
make
ten
dollars
out
of
one
a
beginning
of
extreme
avarice
in
the
efforts
to
hoard
was
followed
by
an
excessive
extravagance
and
as
all
minds
were
bent
only
on
money
there
had
at
the
same
time
developed
a
spirit
of
suspicion
of
intolerance
of
caviling
which
resulted
in
lawsuits
and
hatred
this
also
was
due
to
the
example
of
the
board
it
was
said
for
among
the
first
things
lars
had
done
as
chairman
was
to
sue
the
venerable
old
priest
for
holding
doubtful
titles
the
priest
had
lost
but
had
also
immediately
resigned
at
that
time
some
had
praised
some
censured
this
suit
but
it
had
proved
a
bad
example
now
came
the
consequences
of
lars
management
in
the
form
of
loss
to
every
single
man
of
property
in
the
parish
consequently
public
opinion
underwent
a
sharp
change
the
opposing
force
too
soon
found
a
leader
for
knud
aakre
had
come
into
the
board
introduced
there
by
lars
himself
the
struggle
began
forthwith
all
those
youths
to
whom
knud
in
his
time
had
given
instructions
were
now
grown
up
and
were
the
most
enlightened
men
in
the
parish
thoroughly
at
home
in
all
its
transactions
and
public
affairs
it
was
against
these
men
that
lars
now
had
to
contend
and
they
had
borne
him
a
grudge
from
their
childhood
up
when
of
an
evening
after
one
of
these
stormy
proceedings
he
stood
on
the
steps
in
front
of
his
house
gazing
over
the
parish
he
could
hear
a
sound
as
of
distant
rumbling
thunder
rising
toward
him
from
the
large
gards
now
lying
in
the
storm
he
knew
that
the
day
they
met
their
ruin
the
and
himself
would
be
overthrown
and
all
his
long
efforts
would
culminate
in
imprecations
heaped
on
his
head
in
these
days
of
conflict
and
despair
a
party
of
railroad
commissioners
who
were
to
survey
the
route
for
a
new
road
made
their
appearance
one
evening
at
högstad
the
first
gard
at
the
entrance
to
the
parish
in
the
course
of
conversation
during
the
evening
lars
learned
that
there
was
a
question
whether
the
road
should
run
through
this
valley
or
another
parallel
to
it
like
a
flash
of
lightning
it
darted
through
his
mind
that
if
he
could
succeed
in
having
it
laid
here
all
property
would
rise
in
value
and
not
only
would
he
himself
be
saved
but
his
fame
would
be
transmitted
to
the
latest
posterity
he
could
not
sleep
that
night
for
his
eyes
were
dazzled
by
a
glowing
light
and
sometimes
he
could
even
hear
the
sound
of
the
cars
the
next
day
he
went
himself
with
the
commissioners
while
they
examined
the
locality
his
horse
took
them
and
to
his
gard
they
returned
the
next
day
they
drove
through
the
other
valley
he
was
still
with
them
and
he
drove
them
back
again
to
his
house
they
found
a
brilliant
illumination
at
högstad
the
first
men
of
the
parish
had
been
invited
to
be
present
at
a
magnificent
party
given
in
honor
of
the
commissioners
it
lasted
until
morning
but
to
no
avail
for
the
nearer
they
came
to
a
final
issue
the
more
plainly
it
appeared
that
the
road
could
not
pass
through
this
locality
without
undue
expense
the
entrance
to
the
valley
lay
through
a
narrow
gorge
and
just
as
it
swung
into
the
parish
the
swollen
river
swung
in
also
so
that
the
railroad
would
either
have
to
take
the
same
curve
along
the
mountain
that
the
highway
now
made
thus
running
at
a
needlessly
high
altitude
and
crossing
the
river
twice
or
it
would
have
to
run
straight
forward
and
thus
through
the
old
now
unused
churchyard
now
the
church
had
but
recently
been
removed
and
it
was
not
long
since
the
last
burial
had
taken
place
there
if
it
only
depended
on
a
bit
of
old
churchyard
thought
lars
whether
or
not
this
great
blessing
came
into
the
parish
then
he
must
use
his
name
and
his
energy
for
the
removal
of
this
obstacle
he
at
once
set
forth
on
a
visit
to
the
priest
and
the
dean
and
furthermore
to
the
diocese
council
he
talked
and
he
negotiated
for
he
was
armed
with
all
possible
facts
concerning
the
immense
advantage
of
the
railroad
on
one
hand
and
the
sentiments
of
the
parish
on
the
other
and
actually
succeeded
in
winning
all
parties
it
was
promised
him
that
by
a
removal
of
part
of
the
bodies
to
the
new
churchyard
the
objections
might
be
considered
set
aside
and
the
royal
permission
obtained
for
the
churchyard
to
be
taken
for
the
line
of
railroad
it
was
told
him
that
nothing
was
now
needed
but
for
him
to
set
the
question
afloat
in
the
board
of
supervisors
the
parish
had
grown
as
excited
as
himself
the
spirit
of
speculation
which
for
many
years
had
been
the
only
one
prevailing
in
the
parish
now
became
madly
jubilant
there
was
nothing
spoken
or
thought
of
but
journey
and
its
possible
results
when
he
returned
with
the
most
magnificent
promises
they
made
much
of
him
songs
were
sung
in
his
praise
indeed
if
at
that
time
the
largest
gards
had
gone
to
destruction
one
after
another
no
one
would
have
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
it
the
speculation
craze
had
given
way
to
the
railroad
craze
the
board
of
supervisors
assembled
there
was
presented
for
approval
a
respectful
petition
that
the
old
churchyard
might
be
appropriated
as
the
route
of
the
railroad
this
was
unanimously
adopted
there
was
even
mention
of
giving
lars
a
vote
of
thanks
and
a
in
the
form
of
a
locomotive
but
it
was
finally
thought
best
to
wait
until
the
whole
plan
was
carried
into
execution
the
petition
came
back
from
the
diocese
council
with
a
demand
for
a
list
of
all
bodies
that
would
have
to
be
removed
the
priest
made
out
such
a
list
but
instead
of
sending
it
direct
he
had
his
own
reasons
for
sending
it
through
the
parish
board
one
of
the
members
carried
it
to
the
next
meeting
here
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
lars
as
chairman
to
open
the
envelope
and
read
the
list
now
it
chanced
that
the
first
body
to
be
disinterred
was
that
of
own
grandfather
a
little
shudder
ran
through
the
assembly
lars
himself
was
startled
but
nevertheless
continued
to
read
then
it
furthermore
chanced
that
the
second
body
was
that
of
knud
aakre
grandfather
for
these
two
men
had
died
within
a
short
time
of
each
other
knud
aakre
sprang
from
his
seat
lars
paused
every
one
looked
up
in
consternation
for
old
knud
aakre
had
been
the
benefactor
of
the
parish
and
its
best
beloved
man
time
out
of
mind
there
was
a
dead
silence
which
lasted
for
some
minutes
at
last
lars
cleared
his
throat
and
went
on
reading
but
the
further
he
proceeded
the
worse
the
matter
grew
for
the
nearer
they
came
to
their
own
time
the
dearer
were
the
dead
when
he
had
finished
knud
aakre
asked
quietly
whether
the
others
did
not
agree
with
him
in
thinking
that
the
air
about
them
was
filled
with
spirits
it
was
just
beginning
to
grow
dark
in
the
room
and
although
they
were
mature
men
and
were
sitting
in
numbers
together
they
could
not
refrain
from
feeling
alarmed
lars
produced
a
bundle
of
matches
from
his
pocket
and
struck
a
light
dryly
remarking
that
this
was
no
more
than
they
knew
beforehand
yes
it
is
said
knud
pacing
the
floor
it
is
more
than
i
knew
before
now
i
begin
to
think
that
even
railroads
can
be
purchased
too
dearly
these
words
sent
a
quiver
through
the
audience
and
observing
that
they
had
better
further
consider
the
matter
knud
made
a
motion
to
that
effect
in
the
excitement
which
had
prevailed
he
said
the
benefit
likely
to
be
derived
from
the
road
had
been
overestimated
even
if
the
railroad
did
not
pass
through
this
parish
there
would
have
to
be
stations
at
both
ends
of
the
valley
true
it
would
always
be
a
little
more
troublesome
to
drive
to
them
than
to
a
station
right
in
our
midst
yet
the
difficulty
would
not
be
so
very
great
that
it
would
be
necessary
because
of
it
to
violate
the
repose
of
the
dead
knud
was
one
of
those
who
when
his
thoughts
were
once
in
rapid
motion
could
present
the
most
convincing
arguments
a
moment
before
what
he
now
said
had
not
occurred
to
his
mind
nevertheless
it
struck
home
to
all
lars
felt
the
danger
of
his
position
and
concluding
that
it
was
best
to
be
cautious
apparently
acquiesced
in
knud
proposition
to
reconsider
such
emotions
are
always
worse
in
the
beginning
he
thought
it
is
wisest
to
temporize
with
them
but
he
had
miscalculated
in
ever
increasing
waves
the
dread
of
touching
the
dead
of
their
own
families
swept
over
the
inhabitants
of
the
parish
what
none
of
them
had
thought
of
as
long
as
the
matter
existed
merely
in
the
abstract
now
became
a
serious
question
when
it
was
brought
home
to
themselves
the
women
especially
were
excited
and
the
road
near
the
was
black
with
people
the
day
of
the
next
meeting
it
was
a
warm
summer
day
the
windows
were
removed
and
there
were
as
many
without
the
house
as
within
all
felt
that
a
great
battle
was
about
to
be
fought
lars
came
driving
up
with
his
handsome
horse
and
was
greeted
by
all
he
looked
calmly
and
confidently
around
not
seeming
to
be
surprised
at
anything
he
took
a
seat
near
the
window
found
his
straw
and
a
suspicion
of
a
smile
played
over
his
keen
face
as
he
saw
knud
aakre
rise
to
his
feet
to
act
as
spokesman
for
all
the
dead
in
the
old
högstad
churchyard
but
knud
aakre
did
not
begin
with
the
churchyard
he
began
with
an
accurate
exposition
of
how
greatly
the
profits
likely
to
accrue
from
having
the
railroad
run
through
the
parish
had
been
overestimated
in
all
this
turmoil
he
had
positive
proofs
for
every
statement
he
made
for
he
had
calculated
the
distance
of
each
gard
from
the
nearest
station
and
finally
he
asked
why
has
there
been
so
much
ado
about
this
railroad
if
not
in
behalf
of
the
parish
this
he
could
easily
explain
to
them
there
were
those
who
had
occasioned
so
great
a
disturbance
that
a
still
greater
one
was
required
to
conceal
it
moreover
there
were
those
who
in
the
first
outburst
of
excitement
could
sell
their
gards
and
belongings
to
strangers
who
were
foolish
enough
to
purchase
it
was
a
shameful
speculation
which
not
only
the
living
but
the
dead
must
serve
to
promote
the
effect
of
his
address
was
very
considerable
but
lars
had
once
for
all
resolved
to
preserve
his
composure
let
come
what
would
he
replied
therefore
with
a
smile
that
he
had
been
under
the
impression
that
knud
himself
was
eager
for
the
railroad
and
certainly
no
one
would
accuse
him
of
having
any
knowledge
of
speculation
here
followed
a
little
laugh
knud
had
not
evinced
the
slightest
objection
to
the
removal
of
the
bodies
of
common
people
for
the
sake
of
the
railroad
but
when
his
own
grandfather
body
was
in
question
then
it
suddenly
affected
the
welfare
of
the
whole
community
he
said
no
more
but
looked
with
a
faint
smile
at
knud
as
did
also
several
others
meanwhile
knud
aakre
surprised
both
him
and
them
by
replying
i
confess
it
i
did
not
comprehend
the
matter
until
it
touched
my
own
family
feelings
it
is
possible
that
this
may
be
a
shame
but
it
would
have
been
a
far
greater
one
not
to
have
realized
it
at
last
as
is
the
case
with
lars
never
he
concluded
could
this
raillery
have
been
more
out
of
place
for
to
people
with
common
decency
the
whole
affair
is
absolutely
revolting
this
feeling
is
something
that
has
come
up
quite
recently
replied
lars
we
may
therefore
hope
that
it
will
soon
pass
over
again
may
it
not
perhaps
help
the
matter
a
little
to
think
what
the
priest
dean
diocese
council
engineers
and
government
will
all
say
if
we
first
unanimously
set
the
ball
in
motion
then
come
and
beg
to
have
it
stopped
if
we
first
are
jubilant
and
sing
songs
then
weep
and
deliver
funeral
orations
if
they
do
not
say
that
we
have
gone
mad
in
this
parish
they
must
at
all
events
say
that
we
have
acted
rather
strangely
of
late
yes
god
knows
they
may
well
think
so
replied
knud
we
have
indeed
acted
very
strangely
of
late
and
it
is
high
time
for
us
to
mend
our
ways
things
have
come
to
a
serious
pass
when
we
can
each
disinter
his
own
grandfather
to
make
way
for
a
railroad
when
we
can
disturb
the
of
the
dead
in
order
that
our
own
burdens
may
the
more
easily
be
carried
for
is
not
this
rooting
in
our
churchyard
in
order
to
make
it
yield
us
food
the
same
thing
what
is
buried
there
in
the
name
of
jesus
we
take
up
in
moloch
name
this
is
but
little
better
than
eating
the
bones
of
our
ancestors
such
is
the
course
of
nature
said
lars
dryly
yes
of
plants
and
of
animals
and
are
not
we
animals
we
are
but
also
the
children
of
the
living
god
who
have
buried
our
dead
in
faith
in
him
it
is
he
who
shall
rouse
them
and
not
we
oh
you
are
talking
idly
are
we
not
obliged
to
have
the
graves
dug
up
at
any
rate
when
their
turn
comes
what
harm
is
there
in
having
it
happen
a
few
years
earlier
i
will
tell
you
what
was
born
of
them
still
draws
the
breath
of
life
what
they
built
up
yet
remains
what
they
loved
taught
and
suffered
for
lives
about
us
and
within
us
and
should
we
not
allow
them
to
rest
in
peace
your
warmth
shows
me
that
you
are
thinking
of
your
own
grandfather
again
replied
lars
and
i
must
say
it
seems
to
me
high
time
the
parish
should
be
rid
of
he
monopolized
too
much
space
while
he
lived
and
so
it
is
scarcely
worth
while
to
have
him
lie
in
the
way
now
that
he
is
dead
should
his
corpse
prevent
a
blessing
to
this
parish
that
would
extend
through
a
hundred
generations
we
may
truly
say
that
of
all
who
have
been
born
here
has
done
us
the
greatest
harm
knud
aakre
tossed
back
his
disorderly
hair
his
eyes
flashed
his
whole
person
looked
like
a
bent
steel
spring
how
much
of
a
blessing
what
you
are
speaking
about
may
be
i
have
already
shown
it
has
the
same
character
as
all
the
other
blessings
with
which
you
have
supplied
the
parish
namely
a
doubtful
one
it
is
true
you
have
provided
us
with
a
new
church
but
you
have
also
filled
it
with
a
new
spirit
and
it
is
not
that
of
love
true
you
have
furnished
us
with
new
roads
but
also
with
new
roads
to
destruction
as
is
now
plainly
manifest
in
the
misfortunes
of
many
true
you
have
diminished
our
public
taxes
but
you
have
increased
our
private
ones
lawsuits
promissory
notes
and
bankruptcies
are
no
fruitful
gifts
to
a
community
and
dare
dishonor
in
his
grave
the
man
whom
the
whole
parish
blesses
you
dare
assert
that
he
lies
in
our
way
aye
no
doubt
he
does
lie
in
your
way
this
is
plain
enough
now
for
his
grave
will
be
the
cause
of
your
downfall
the
spirit
which
has
reigned
over
you
and
until
over
us
all
was
not
born
to
rule
but
to
enter
into
servitude
the
churchyard
will
surely
be
allowed
to
remain
in
peace
but
it
shall
have
one
grave
added
to
it
namely
that
of
your
popularity
which
is
now
to
be
buried
there
lars
högstad
rose
white
as
a
sheet
his
lips
parted
but
he
was
unable
to
utter
a
word
and
the
straw
fell
after
three
or
four
vain
efforts
to
find
it
again
and
recover
his
powers
of
speech
he
burst
forth
like
a
volcano
with
and
so
these
are
the
thanks
i
get
for
all
my
toil
and
drudgery
if
such
a
is
to
be
allowed
to
rule
why
then
may
the
devil
be
your
chairman
if
ever
i
set
my
foot
here
again
i
have
kept
things
together
until
this
day
and
after
me
your
trash
will
fall
into
a
thousand
pieces
but
let
it
tumble
down
now
here
is
the
register
and
he
flung
it
on
the
table
shame
on
such
an
assembly
of
old
women
and
brats
here
he
struck
the
table
with
great
violence
shame
on
the
whole
parish
that
it
can
see
a
man
rewarded
as
i
am
now
he
brought
down
his
fist
once
more
with
such
force
that
the
great
table
shook
and
the
inkstand
with
its
entire
contents
tumbled
to
the
floor
marking
for
all
future
generations
the
spot
where
lars
högstad
fell
in
spite
of
all
his
prudence
his
long
rule
and
his
patience
he
rushed
to
the
door
and
in
a
few
moments
had
left
the
place
the
entire
assembly
remained
motionless
for
the
might
of
his
voice
and
of
his
wrath
had
frightened
them
until
knud
aakre
remembering
the
taunt
he
had
received
at
the
time
of
fall
with
beaming
countenance
and
imitating
lars
voice
exclaimed
is
to
be
the
decisive
blow
in
the
matter
the
whole
assembly
burst
into
peals
of
merriment
at
these
words
the
solemn
meeting
ended
in
laughter
talk
and
high
glee
only
a
few
left
the
place
those
remaining
behind
called
for
drink
to
add
to
their
food
and
a
night
of
thunder
succeeded
a
day
of
lightning
every
one
felt
as
happy
and
independent
as
of
yore
ere
the
commanding
spirit
of
lars
had
cowed
their
souls
into
dumb
obedience
they
drank
toasts
to
their
freedom
they
sang
indeed
finally
they
danced
knud
aakre
and
the
taking
the
lead
and
all
the
rest
following
while
boys
and
girls
joined
in
and
the
young
folks
outside
shouted
hurrah
for
such
a
jollification
they
had
never
before
seen
chapter
iii
lars
moved
about
in
the
large
rooms
at
högstad
without
speaking
a
word
his
wife
who
loved
him
but
always
in
fear
and
trembling
dared
not
come
into
his
presence
the
management
of
the
gard
and
of
the
house
might
be
carried
on
as
best
it
could
while
on
the
other
hand
there
kept
growing
a
multitude
of
letters
which
passed
back
and
forth
between
högstad
and
the
parish
and
högstad
and
the
for
lars
had
claims
against
the
parish
board
and
these
not
being
satisfied
he
prosecuted
against
the
which
were
also
unsatisfied
and
so
resulted
in
another
suit
he
took
offense
at
expressions
in
the
letters
he
received
and
went
to
law
again
now
against
the
chairman
of
the
parish
board
now
against
the
president
of
the
at
the
same
time
there
were
dreadful
articles
in
the
newspapers
which
report
attributed
to
him
and
which
were
the
cause
of
great
dissension
in
the
parish
inciting
neighbor
against
neighbor
sometimes
he
was
absent
whole
weeks
no
one
knew
where
and
when
he
returned
he
lived
as
secluded
as
before
at
church
he
had
not
been
seen
after
the
great
scene
at
the
representatives
meeting
then
one
saturday
evening
the
priest
brought
tidings
that
the
railroad
was
to
run
through
the
parish
after
all
and
across
the
old
churchyard
it
struck
like
lightning
into
every
home
the
unanimous
opposition
of
the
parish
board
had
been
in
vain
lars
högstad
influence
had
been
stronger
this
was
the
meaning
of
his
journeys
this
was
his
work
involuntary
admiration
of
the
man
and
his
stubborn
persistence
tended
to
suppress
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
people
at
their
own
defeat
and
the
more
they
discussed
the
matter
the
more
reconciled
they
became
for
a
fact
accomplished
always
contains
within
itself
reasons
why
it
is
so
which
gradually
force
themselves
upon
us
after
there
is
no
longer
possibility
of
change
the
people
assembled
about
the
church
the
next
day
and
they
could
not
help
laughing
as
they
met
one
another
and
just
as
the
whole
congregation
young
and
old
men
and
women
aye
even
children
were
all
talking
about
lars
högstad
his
ability
his
rigorous
will
his
immense
influence
he
himself
with
his
whole
household
came
driving
up
in
four
conveyances
one
after
the
other
it
was
two
years
since
his
last
visit
there
he
alighted
and
passed
through
the
crowd
while
all
as
by
one
impulse
unhesitatingly
greeted
him
but
he
did
not
deign
to
bestow
a
glance
on
either
side
nor
to
return
a
single
salutation
his
little
wife
pale
as
death
followed
him
inside
of
the
church
the
astonishment
grew
to
such
a
pitch
that
as
one
after
another
caught
sight
of
him
they
stopped
singing
and
only
stared
at
him
knud
aakre
who
sat
in
his
pew
in
front
of
lars
noticed
that
there
was
something
the
matter
and
as
he
perceived
nothing
remarkable
in
front
of
him
he
turned
round
he
saw
lars
bowed
over
his
searching
for
the
place
he
had
not
seen
him
since
that
evening
at
the
meeting
and
such
a
complete
change
he
had
not
believed
possible
for
this
was
no
victor
the
thin
soft
hair
was
thinner
than
ever
the
face
was
haggard
and
emaciated
the
eyes
hollow
and
bloodshot
the
giant
neck
had
dwindled
into
wrinkles
and
cords
knud
comprehended
at
a
glance
what
this
man
had
gone
through
he
was
seized
with
a
feeling
of
strong
sympathy
indeed
he
felt
something
of
the
old
love
stirring
within
his
breast
he
prayed
for
lars
to
his
god
and
made
a
resolute
vow
that
he
would
seek
him
after
service
but
lars
had
started
on
ahead
knud
resolved
to
call
on
him
that
evening
his
wife
however
held
him
back
lars
is
one
of
those
said
she
who
can
scarcely
bear
a
debt
of
gratitude
keep
away
from
him
until
he
has
an
opportunity
to
do
you
some
favor
and
then
perhaps
he
will
come
to
you
but
he
did
not
come
he
appeared
now
and
then
at
church
but
nowhere
else
and
he
associated
with
no
one
on
the
other
hand
he
now
devoted
himself
to
his
gard
and
other
business
with
the
passionate
zeal
of
one
who
had
determined
to
make
amends
in
one
year
for
the
neglect
of
many
and
indeed
there
were
those
who
said
that
this
was
imperative
railroad
operations
in
the
valley
began
very
soon
as
the
line
was
to
go
directly
past
lars
gard
he
tore
down
the
portion
of
his
house
that
faced
the
road
in
order
to
build
a
large
and
handsome
balcony
for
he
was
determined
that
his
gard
should
attract
attention
this
work
was
just
being
done
when
the
temporary
rails
for
the
conveyance
of
gravel
and
timber
to
the
road
were
laid
and
a
small
locomotive
was
sent
to
the
spot
it
was
a
beautiful
autumn
evening
that
the
first
gravel
car
was
to
pass
over
the
road
lars
stood
on
his
front
steps
to
hear
the
first
signal
and
to
see
the
first
column
of
smoke
all
the
people
of
the
gard
were
gathered
about
him
he
gazed
over
the
parish
illumined
by
the
setting
sun
and
he
felt
that
he
would
be
remembered
as
long
as
a
train
should
come
roaring
through
this
fertile
valley
a
sense
of
forgiveness
glided
into
his
soul
he
looked
toward
the
churchyard
a
part
of
which
still
remained
with
crosses
bowed
down
to
the
ground
but
a
part
of
it
was
now
the
railroad
he
was
just
endeavoring
to
define
his
own
feeling
when
the
first
signal
whistled
and
presently
the
train
came
slowly
working
its
way
along
attended
by
a
cloud
of
smoke
mingled
with
sparks
for
the
locomotive
was
fed
with
pine
wood
the
wind
blew
toward
the
house
so
that
those
standing
without
were
soon
enveloped
in
a
dense
smoke
but
as
this
cleared
away
lars
saw
the
train
working
its
way
down
through
the
valley
like
a
strong
will
he
was
content
and
entered
his
house
like
one
who
has
come
from
a
long
day
work
the
image
of
his
grandfather
stood
before
him
at
this
moment
this
grandfather
had
raised
the
family
from
poverty
to
prosperity
true
a
portion
of
his
honor
as
a
citizen
was
consumed
in
the
act
but
he
had
advanced
nevertheless
his
faults
were
the
prevailing
ones
of
his
time
they
were
based
on
the
uncertain
boundary
lines
of
the
moral
conceptions
of
his
day
every
age
has
its
uncertain
moral
distinctions
and
its
victims
to
the
endeavor
to
define
them
properly
honor
be
to
him
in
his
grave
for
he
had
suffered
and
toiled
peace
be
with
him
it
must
be
good
to
rest
in
the
end
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
rest
because
of
his
grandson
vast
ambition
his
ashes
were
thrown
up
with
the
stones
and
the
gravel
nonsense
he
would
only
smile
that
his
grandson
work
passed
over
his
head
amid
thoughts
like
these
lars
had
undressed
and
gone
to
bed
once
more
his
grandfather
image
glided
before
him
it
was
sterner
now
than
the
first
time
weariness
enfeebles
us
and
lars
began
to
reproach
himself
but
he
defended
himself
also
what
did
his
grandfather
want
surely
he
ought
to
be
satisfied
now
for
the
family
honor
was
proclaimed
in
loud
tones
above
his
grave
who
else
had
such
a
monument
and
yet
what
is
this
these
two
monstrous
eyes
of
fire
and
this
hissing
roaring
sound
belong
no
longer
to
the
locomotive
for
they
turn
away
from
the
railroad
track
and
from
the
churchyard
straight
toward
the
house
comes
an
immense
procession
the
eyes
of
fire
are
his
grandfather
and
the
long
line
of
followers
are
all
the
dead
the
train
advances
steadily
toward
the
gard
roaring
crackling
flashing
the
windows
blaze
in
the
reflection
of
the
dead
men
eyes
lars
made
a
mighty
effort
to
control
himself
for
this
was
a
dream
unquestionably
but
a
dream
only
wait
until
i
am
awake
there
now
i
am
awake
come
on
poor
ghosts
and
lo
they
really
did
come
from
the
churchyard
overthrowing
road
rails
locomotive
and
train
so
that
these
fell
with
a
mighty
crash
to
the
ground
and
the
green
sod
appeared
in
their
stead
dotted
with
graves
and
crosses
as
before
like
mighty
champions
they
advanced
and
the
hymn
let
the
dead
repose
in
peace
preceded
them
lars
knew
it
for
through
all
these
years
it
had
been
sighing
within
his
soul
and
now
it
had
become
his
requiem
for
this
was
death
and
death
visions
the
cold
sweat
started
out
over
his
whole
body
for
nearer
and
nearer
and
behold
on
the
window
pane
there
they
are
now
and
he
heard
some
one
speak
his
name
overpowered
with
dread
he
struggled
to
scream
for
he
was
being
strangled
a
cold
hand
was
clinching
his
throat
and
he
regained
his
voice
in
an
agonized
help
me
and
awoke
the
window
had
been
broken
in
from
the
outside
the
pieces
flew
all
about
his
head
he
sprang
up
a
man
stood
at
the
window
surrounded
by
smoke
and
flames
the
gard
is
on
fire
lars
we
will
help
you
out
it
was
knud
aakre
when
lars
regained
his
consciousness
he
was
lying
outside
in
a
bleak
wind
which
chilled
his
limbs
there
was
not
a
soul
with
him
he
saw
the
flaming
gard
to
the
left
around
him
his
cattle
were
grazing
and
making
their
voices
heard
the
sheep
were
huddled
together
in
a
frightened
flock
the
household
goods
were
scattered
about
and
when
he
looked
again
he
saw
some
one
sitting
on
a
knoll
close
by
weeping
it
was
his
wife
he
called
her
by
name
she
started
the
lord
jesus
be
praised
that
you
are
alive
cried
she
coming
forward
and
seating
herself
or
rather
throwing
herself
down
in
front
of
him
o
god
o
god
we
surely
have
had
enough
of
this
railroad
now
the
railroad
asked
he
but
ere
the
words
had
escaped
his
lips
a
clear
comprehension
of
the
case
passed
like
a
shudder
over
him
for
of
course
sparks
from
the
locomotive
that
had
fallen
among
the
shavings
of
the
new
side
wall
had
been
the
cause
of
the
fire
lars
sat
there
brooding
in
silence
his
wife
not
daring
to
utter
another
word
began
to
search
for
his
clothes
for
what
she
had
spread
over
him
as
he
lay
senseless
had
fallen
off
he
accepted
her
attentions
in
silence
but
as
she
knelt
before
him
to
cover
his
feet
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
head
falling
forward
she
buried
her
face
in
his
lap
and
wept
aloud
there
were
many
who
eyed
her
curiously
but
lars
understood
her
and
said
you
are
the
only
friend
i
have
even
though
it
had
cost
the
gard
to
hear
these
words
it
mattered
not
to
her
she
felt
so
happy
that
she
gained
courage
and
rising
up
and
looking
humbly
into
her
husband
face
she
said
because
there
is
no
one
else
who
understands
you
then
a
hard
heart
melted
and
tears
rolled
down
the
man
cheeks
as
he
clung
to
his
wife
hand
now
he
talked
to
her
as
to
his
own
soul
now
too
she
opened
to
him
her
mind
they
also
talked
about
how
all
this
had
happened
or
rather
he
listened
while
she
told
about
it
knud
aakre
had
been
the
first
to
see
the
fire
had
roused
his
people
sent
the
girls
out
over
his
parish
while
he
had
hastened
himself
with
men
and
horses
to
the
scene
of
the
conflagration
where
all
were
sleeping
he
had
engineered
the
extinguishing
of
the
flames
and
the
rescuing
of
the
household
goods
and
had
himself
dragged
lars
from
the
burning
room
and
carried
him
to
the
left
side
of
the
house
from
where
the
wind
was
blowing
and
had
laid
him
out
here
in
the
churchyard
and
while
they
were
talking
of
this
some
one
came
driving
rapidly
up
the
road
and
turned
into
the
churchyard
where
he
alighted
it
was
knud
who
had
been
home
after
his
the
one
in
which
they
had
so
many
times
ridden
together
to
and
from
the
meetings
of
the
parish
board
now
he
requested
lars
to
get
in
and
ride
home
with
him
they
grasped
each
other
by
the
hand
the
one
sitting
the
other
standing
come
with
me
now
said
knud
without
a
word
of
reply
lars
rose
side
by
side
they
walked
to
the
cart
lars
was
helped
in
knud
sat
down
beside
him
what
they
talked
about
as
they
drove
along
or
afterwards
in
the
little
chamber
at
aakre
where
they
remained
together
until
late
in
the
morning
has
never
been
known
but
from
that
day
they
were
inseparable
as
before
as
soon
as
misfortune
overtakes
a
man
every
one
learns
what
he
is
worth
and
so
the
parish
undertook
to
rebuild
lars
högstad
houses
and
to
make
them
larger
and
handsomer
than
any
others
in
the
valley
he
was
reëlected
chairman
but
with
knud
aakre
at
his
side
he
never
again
failed
to
take
counsel
of
knud
intelligence
and
heart
and
from
that
day
forth
nothing
went
to
ruin
thrond
there
was
once
a
man
named
alf
who
had
raised
great
expectations
among
his
because
he
excelled
most
of
them
both
in
the
work
he
accomplished
and
in
the
advice
he
gave
now
when
this
man
was
thirty
years
old
he
went
to
live
up
the
mountain
and
cleared
a
piece
of
land
for
farming
about
fourteen
miles
from
any
settlement
many
people
wondered
how
he
could
endure
thus
depending
on
himself
for
companionship
but
they
were
still
more
astonished
when
a
few
years
later
a
young
girl
from
the
valley
and
one
too
who
had
been
the
gayest
of
the
gay
at
all
the
social
gatherings
and
dances
of
the
parish
was
willing
to
share
his
solitude
this
couple
were
called
the
people
in
the
wood
and
the
man
was
known
by
the
name
alf
in
the
wood
people
viewed
him
with
inquisitive
eyes
when
they
met
him
at
church
or
at
work
because
they
did
not
understand
him
but
neither
did
he
take
the
trouble
to
give
them
any
explanation
of
his
conduct
his
wife
was
only
seen
in
the
parish
twice
and
on
one
of
these
occasions
it
was
to
present
a
child
for
baptism
this
child
was
a
son
and
he
was
called
thrond
when
he
grew
larger
his
parents
often
talked
about
needing
help
and
as
they
could
not
afford
to
take
a
servant
they
hired
what
they
called
a
half
they
brought
into
their
house
a
girl
of
fourteen
who
took
care
of
the
boy
while
the
father
and
mother
were
busy
in
the
field
this
girl
was
not
the
brightest
person
in
the
world
and
the
boy
soon
observed
that
his
mother
words
were
easy
to
comprehend
but
that
it
was
hard
to
get
at
the
meaning
of
what
ragnhild
said
he
never
talked
much
with
his
father
and
he
was
rather
afraid
of
him
for
the
house
had
to
be
kept
very
quiet
when
he
was
at
home
one
christmas
eve
they
were
burning
two
candles
on
the
table
and
the
father
was
drinking
from
a
white
flask
the
father
took
the
boy
up
in
his
arms
and
set
him
on
his
lap
looked
him
sternly
in
the
eyes
and
exclaimed
ugh
boy
then
he
added
more
gently
why
you
are
not
so
much
afraid
would
you
have
the
courage
to
listen
to
a
story
the
boy
made
no
reply
but
he
looked
full
in
his
father
face
his
father
then
told
him
about
a
man
from
vaage
whose
name
was
blessom
this
man
was
in
copenhagen
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
king
verdict
in
a
he
was
engaged
in
and
he
was
detained
so
long
that
christmas
eve
overtook
him
there
blessom
was
greatly
annoyed
at
this
and
as
he
was
sauntering
about
the
streets
fancying
himself
at
home
he
saw
a
very
large
man
in
a
white
short
coat
walking
in
front
of
him
how
fast
you
are
walking
said
blessom
i
have
a
long
distance
to
go
in
order
to
get
home
this
evening
replied
the
man
where
are
you
going
to
vaage
answered
the
man
and
walked
on
why
that
is
very
nice
said
blessom
for
that
is
where
i
was
going
too
well
then
you
may
ride
with
me
if
you
will
stand
on
the
runners
of
my
sledge
answered
the
man
and
turned
into
a
side
street
where
his
horse
was
standing
he
mounted
his
seat
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
blessom
who
was
just
getting
on
the
runners
you
had
better
hold
fast
said
the
stranger
blessom
did
as
he
was
told
and
it
was
well
he
did
for
their
journey
was
evidently
not
by
land
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
driving
on
the
water
cried
blessom
i
am
said
the
man
and
the
spray
whirled
about
them
but
after
a
while
it
seemed
to
blessom
their
course
no
longer
lay
on
the
water
it
seems
to
me
we
are
moving
through
the
air
said
he
yes
so
we
are
replied
the
stranger
but
when
they
had
gone
still
farther
blessom
thought
he
recognized
the
parish
they
were
driving
through
is
not
this
vaage
cried
he
yes
now
we
are
there
replied
the
stranger
and
it
seemed
to
blessom
that
they
had
gone
pretty
fast
thank
you
for
the
good
ride
said
he
thanks
to
yourself
replied
the
man
and
added
as
he
whipped
up
his
horse
now
you
had
better
not
look
after
me
no
indeed
thought
blessom
and
started
over
the
hills
for
home
but
just
then
so
loud
and
terrible
a
crash
was
heard
behind
him
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
mountain
must
be
tumbling
down
and
a
bright
light
was
shed
over
the
surrounding
landscape
he
looked
round
and
beheld
the
stranger
in
the
white
coat
driving
through
the
crackling
flames
into
the
open
mountain
which
was
yawning
wide
to
receive
him
like
some
huge
gate
blessom
felt
somewhat
strange
in
regard
to
his
traveling
companion
and
thought
he
would
look
in
another
direction
but
as
he
had
turned
his
head
so
it
remained
and
never
more
could
blessom
get
it
straight
again
the
boy
had
never
heard
anything
to
equal
this
in
all
his
life
he
dared
not
ask
his
father
for
more
but
early
the
next
morning
he
asked
his
mother
if
she
knew
any
stories
yes
of
course
she
did
but
hers
were
chiefly
about
princesses
who
were
in
captivity
for
seven
years
until
the
right
prince
came
along
the
boy
believed
that
everything
he
heard
or
read
about
took
place
close
around
him
he
was
about
eight
years
old
when
the
first
stranger
entered
their
door
one
winter
evening
he
had
black
hair
and
this
was
something
thrond
had
never
seen
before
the
stranger
saluted
them
with
a
short
and
came
forward
thrond
grew
frightened
and
sat
down
on
a
cricket
by
the
hearth
the
mother
asked
the
man
to
take
a
seat
on
the
bench
along
the
wall
he
did
so
and
then
the
mother
could
examine
his
face
more
closely
dear
me
is
not
this
knud
the
fiddler
cried
she
yes
to
be
sure
it
is
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
played
at
your
wedding
oh
yes
it
is
quite
a
while
now
have
you
been
on
a
long
journey
i
have
been
playing
for
christmas
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
but
half
way
down
the
slope
i
began
to
feel
very
badly
and
i
was
obliged
to
come
in
here
to
rest
the
mother
brought
forward
food
for
him
he
sat
down
to
the
table
but
did
not
say
in
the
name
of
jesus
as
the
boy
had
been
accustomed
to
hear
when
he
had
finished
eating
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
said
now
i
feel
very
comfortable
let
me
rest
a
little
while
and
he
was
allowed
to
rest
on
thrond
bed
for
thrond
a
bed
was
made
on
the
floor
as
the
boy
lay
there
he
felt
cold
on
the
side
that
was
turned
away
from
the
fire
and
that
was
the
left
side
he
discovered
that
it
was
because
this
side
was
exposed
to
the
chill
night
air
for
he
was
lying
out
in
the
wood
how
came
he
in
the
wood
he
got
up
and
looked
about
him
and
saw
that
there
was
fire
burning
a
long
distance
off
and
that
he
was
actually
alone
in
the
wood
he
longed
to
go
home
to
the
fire
but
could
not
stir
from
the
spot
then
a
great
fear
overcame
him
for
wild
beasts
might
be
roaming
about
trolls
and
ghosts
might
appear
to
him
he
must
get
home
to
the
fire
but
he
could
not
stir
from
the
spot
then
his
terror
grew
he
strove
with
all
his
might
to
gain
and
was
at
last
able
to
cry
mother
and
then
he
awoke
dear
child
you
have
had
bad
dreams
said
she
and
took
him
up
a
shudder
ran
through
him
and
he
glanced
round
the
stranger
was
gone
and
he
dared
not
inquire
after
him
his
mother
appeared
in
her
black
dress
and
started
for
the
parish
she
came
home
with
two
new
strangers
who
also
had
black
hair
and
who
wore
flat
caps
they
did
not
say
in
the
name
of
jesus
when
they
ate
and
they
talked
in
low
tones
with
the
father
afterward
the
latter
and
they
went
into
the
barn
and
came
out
again
with
a
large
box
which
the
men
carried
between
them
they
placed
it
on
a
sled
and
said
farewell
then
the
mother
said
wait
a
little
and
take
with
you
the
smaller
box
he
brought
here
with
him
and
she
went
in
to
get
it
but
one
of
the
men
said
can
have
that
and
he
pointed
at
thrond
use
it
as
well
as
who
is
now
lying
added
the
other
stranger
pointing
at
the
large
box
then
they
both
laughed
and
went
on
thrond
looked
at
the
little
box
which
thus
came
into
his
possession
what
is
there
in
it
asked
he
carry
it
in
and
find
out
said
the
mother
he
did
as
he
was
told
but
his
mother
helped
him
open
it
then
a
great
joy
lighted
up
his
face
for
he
saw
something
very
light
and
fine
lying
there
take
it
up
said
his
mother
he
put
just
one
finger
down
on
it
but
quickly
drew
it
back
again
in
great
alarm
it
cries
said
he
have
courage
said
his
mother
and
he
grasped
it
with
his
whole
hand
and
drew
it
forth
from
the
box
he
weighed
it
and
turned
it
round
he
laughed
and
felt
of
it
dear
me
what
is
it
asked
he
for
it
was
as
light
as
a
toy
it
is
a
fiddle
this
was
the
way
that
thrond
alfson
got
his
first
violin
the
father
could
play
a
little
and
he
taught
the
boy
how
to
handle
the
instrument
the
mother
could
sing
the
tunes
she
remembered
from
her
dancing
days
and
these
the
boy
learned
but
soon
began
to
make
new
ones
for
himself
he
played
all
the
time
he
was
not
at
his
books
he
played
until
his
father
once
told
him
he
was
fading
away
before
his
eyes
all
the
boy
had
read
and
heard
until
that
time
was
put
into
the
fiddle
the
tender
delicate
string
was
his
mother
the
one
that
lay
close
beside
it
and
always
accompanied
his
mother
was
ragnhild
the
coarse
string
which
he
seldom
ventured
to
play
on
was
his
father
but
of
the
last
solemn
string
he
was
half
afraid
and
he
gave
no
name
to
it
when
he
played
a
wrong
note
on
the
e
string
it
was
the
cat
but
when
he
took
a
wrong
note
on
his
father
string
it
was
the
ox
the
bow
was
blessom
who
drove
from
copenhagen
to
vaage
in
one
night
and
every
tune
he
played
represented
something
the
one
containing
the
long
solemn
tones
was
his
mother
in
her
black
dress
the
one
that
jerked
and
skipped
was
like
moses
who
stuttered
and
smote
the
rock
with
his
staff
the
one
that
had
to
be
played
quietly
with
the
bow
moving
lightly
over
the
strings
was
the
hulder
in
yonder
fog
calling
together
her
cattle
where
no
one
but
herself
could
see
but
the
music
wafted
him
onward
over
the
mountains
and
a
great
yearning
took
possession
of
his
soul
one
day
when
his
father
told
about
a
little
boy
who
had
been
playing
at
the
fair
and
who
had
earned
a
great
deal
of
money
thrond
waited
for
his
mother
in
the
kitchen
and
asked
her
softly
if
he
could
not
go
to
the
fair
and
play
for
people
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
said
his
mother
but
she
immediately
spoke
to
his
father
about
it
he
will
get
out
into
the
world
soon
enough
answered
the
father
and
he
spoke
in
such
a
way
that
the
mother
did
not
ask
again
shortly
after
this
the
father
and
mother
were
talking
at
table
about
some
new
settlers
who
had
recently
moved
up
on
the
mountain
and
were
about
to
be
married
they
had
no
fiddler
for
the
wedding
the
father
said
could
not
i
be
the
fiddler
whispered
the
boy
when
he
was
alone
in
the
kitchen
once
more
with
his
mother
what
a
little
boy
like
you
said
she
but
she
went
out
to
the
barn
where
his
father
was
and
told
him
about
it
he
has
never
been
in
the
parish
she
added
he
has
never
seen
a
church
i
should
not
think
you
would
ask
about
such
things
said
alf
but
neither
did
he
say
anything
more
and
so
the
mother
thought
she
had
permission
consequently
she
went
over
to
the
new
settlers
and
offered
the
boy
services
the
way
he
plays
said
she
no
little
boy
has
ever
played
before
and
the
boy
was
to
be
allowed
to
come
what
joy
there
was
at
home
thrond
played
from
morning
until
evening
and
practiced
new
tunes
at
night
he
dreamed
about
them
they
bore
him
far
over
the
hills
away
to
foreign
lands
as
though
he
were
afloat
on
sailing
clouds
his
mother
made
a
new
suit
of
clothes
for
him
but
his
father
would
not
take
part
in
what
was
going
on
the
last
night
he
did
not
sleep
but
thought
out
a
new
tune
about
the
church
which
he
had
never
seen
he
was
up
early
in
the
morning
and
so
was
his
mother
in
order
to
get
him
his
breakfast
but
he
could
not
eat
he
put
on
his
new
clothes
and
took
his
fiddle
in
his
hand
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
a
bright
light
were
glowing
before
his
eyes
his
mother
accompanied
him
out
on
the
and
stood
watching
him
as
he
ascended
the
slopes
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
left
home
his
father
got
quietly
out
of
bed
and
walked
to
the
window
he
stood
there
following
the
boy
with
his
eyes
until
he
heard
the
mother
out
on
the
then
he
went
back
to
bed
and
was
lying
down
when
she
came
in
she
kept
stirring
about
him
as
if
she
wanted
to
relieve
her
mind
of
something
and
finally
it
came
out
i
really
think
i
must
walk
down
to
the
church
and
see
how
things
are
going
he
made
no
reply
and
therefore
she
considered
the
matter
settled
dressed
herself
and
started
it
was
a
glorious
sunny
day
the
boy
walked
rapidly
onward
he
listened
to
the
song
of
the
birds
and
saw
the
sun
glittering
among
the
foliage
while
he
proceeded
on
his
way
with
his
fiddle
under
his
arm
and
when
he
reached
the
bride
house
he
was
still
so
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
that
he
observed
neither
the
bridal
splendor
nor
the
procession
he
merely
asked
if
they
were
about
to
start
and
learned
that
they
were
he
walked
on
in
advance
with
his
fiddle
and
he
played
the
whole
morning
into
it
and
the
tones
he
produced
resounded
through
the
trees
will
we
soon
see
the
church
he
asked
over
his
shoulder
for
a
long
time
he
received
only
no
for
an
answer
but
at
last
some
one
said
as
soon
as
you
reach
that
crag
yonder
you
will
see
it
he
threw
his
newest
tune
into
the
fiddle
the
bow
danced
on
the
strings
and
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
intently
before
him
there
lay
the
parish
right
in
front
of
him
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
a
little
light
mist
curling
like
smoke
on
the
opposite
mountain
side
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
green
meadow
and
the
large
houses
with
windows
which
glistened
beneath
the
scorching
rays
of
the
sun
like
the
glacier
on
a
winter
day
the
houses
kept
increasing
in
size
the
windows
in
number
and
here
on
one
side
of
him
lay
the
enormous
red
house
in
front
of
which
horses
were
tied
little
children
were
playing
on
a
hill
dogs
were
sitting
watching
them
but
everywhere
there
penetrated
a
long
heavy
tone
that
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
and
everything
he
saw
seemed
to
vibrate
with
that
tone
then
suddenly
he
saw
a
large
straight
house
with
a
tall
glittering
staff
reaching
up
to
the
skies
and
below
a
hundred
windows
blazed
so
that
the
house
seemed
to
be
enveloped
in
flames
this
must
be
the
church
the
boy
thought
and
the
music
must
come
from
it
round
about
stood
a
vast
multitude
of
people
and
they
all
looked
alike
he
put
them
forthwith
into
relations
with
the
church
and
thus
acquired
a
respect
mingled
with
awe
for
the
smallest
child
he
saw
now
i
must
play
thought
thrond
and
tried
to
do
so
but
what
was
this
the
fiddle
had
no
longer
any
sound
in
it
there
must
be
some
defect
in
the
strings
he
examined
but
could
find
none
then
it
must
be
because
i
do
not
press
on
hard
enough
and
he
drew
his
bow
with
a
firmer
hand
but
the
fiddle
seemed
as
if
it
were
cracked
he
changed
the
tune
that
was
meant
to
represent
the
church
into
another
but
with
equally
bad
results
no
music
was
produced
only
squeaking
and
wailing
he
felt
the
cold
sweat
start
out
over
his
face
he
thought
of
all
these
wise
people
who
were
standing
here
and
perhaps
laughing
him
to
scorn
this
boy
who
at
home
could
play
so
beautifully
but
who
here
failed
to
bring
out
a
single
tone
thank
god
that
mother
is
not
here
to
see
my
shame
said
he
softly
to
himself
as
he
played
among
the
people
but
lo
there
she
stood
in
her
black
dress
and
she
shrank
farther
and
farther
away
at
that
moment
he
beheld
far
up
on
the
spire
the
man
who
had
given
him
the
fiddle
give
it
back
to
me
he
now
shouted
laughing
and
stretching
out
his
arms
and
the
spire
went
up
and
down
with
him
up
and
down
but
the
boy
took
the
fiddle
under
one
arm
screaming
you
shall
not
have
it
and
turning
ran
away
from
the
people
beyond
the
houses
onward
through
meadow
and
field
until
his
strength
forsook
him
and
then
sank
to
the
ground
there
he
lay
for
a
long
time
with
his
face
toward
the
earth
and
when
finally
he
looked
round
he
saw
and
heard
only
god
infinite
blue
sky
that
floated
above
him
with
its
everlasting
sough
this
was
so
terrible
to
him
that
he
had
to
turn
his
face
to
the
ground
again
when
he
raised
his
head
once
more
his
eyes
fell
on
his
fiddle
which
lay
at
his
side
this
is
all
your
fault
shouted
the
boy
and
seized
the
instrument
with
the
intention
of
dashing
it
to
pieces
but
hesitated
as
he
looked
at
it
we
have
had
many
a
happy
hour
together
said
he
then
paused
presently
he
said
the
strings
must
be
severed
for
they
are
worthless
and
he
took
out
a
knife
and
cut
oh
cried
the
e
string
in
a
short
pained
tone
the
boy
cut
oh
wailed
the
next
but
the
boy
cut
oh
said
the
third
mournfully
and
he
paused
at
the
fourth
a
sharp
pain
seized
him
that
fourth
string
to
which
he
never
dared
give
a
name
he
did
not
cut
now
a
feeling
came
over
him
that
it
was
not
the
fault
of
the
strings
that
he
was
unable
to
play
and
just
then
he
saw
his
mother
walking
slowly
up
the
slope
toward
where
he
was
lying
that
she
might
take
him
home
with
her
a
greater
fright
than
ever
overcame
him
he
held
the
fiddle
by
the
severed
strings
sprang
to
his
feet
and
shouted
down
to
her
no
mother
i
will
not
go
home
again
until
i
can
play
what
i
have
seen
a
dangerous
wooing
when
aslaug
had
become
a
girl
there
was
not
much
peace
to
be
had
at
huseby
for
there
the
finest
boys
in
the
parish
quarreled
and
fought
night
after
night
it
was
worst
of
all
on
saturday
nights
but
then
old
knud
huseby
never
went
to
bed
without
keeping
his
leather
breeches
on
nor
without
having
a
birch
stick
by
his
bedside
if
i
have
a
daughter
i
shall
look
after
her
too
said
old
huseby
thore
næset
was
only
a
houseman
son
nevertheless
there
were
those
who
said
that
he
was
the
one
who
came
oftenest
to
see
the
gardman
daughter
at
huseby
old
knud
did
not
like
this
and
declared
also
that
it
was
not
true
for
he
had
never
seen
him
there
but
people
smiled
slyly
among
themselves
and
thought
that
had
he
searched
in
the
corners
of
the
room
instead
of
fighting
with
all
those
who
were
making
a
noise
and
uproar
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
would
have
found
thore
spring
came
and
aslaug
went
to
the
sæter
with
the
cattle
then
when
the
day
was
warm
down
in
the
valley
and
the
mountain
rose
cool
above
the
haze
and
when
the
bells
tinkled
the
shepherd
dog
barked
and
aslaug
sang
and
blew
the
loor
on
the
mountain
side
then
the
hearts
of
the
young
fellows
who
were
at
work
down
on
the
meadow
would
ache
and
the
first
saturday
night
they
all
started
up
to
the
mountain
sæter
one
faster
than
the
other
but
still
more
rapidly
did
they
come
down
again
for
behind
the
door
at
the
sæter
there
stood
one
who
received
each
of
them
as
he
came
and
gave
him
so
sound
a
whipping
that
he
forever
afterward
remembered
the
threat
that
followed
it
come
again
another
time
and
you
shall
have
some
more
according
to
what
these
young
fellows
knew
there
was
only
one
in
the
parish
who
could
use
his
fists
in
this
way
and
that
was
thore
næset
and
these
rich
gardmen
sons
thought
it
was
a
shame
that
this
houseman
son
should
cut
them
all
out
at
the
huseby
sæter
so
thought
also
old
knud
when
the
matter
reached
his
ears
and
said
moreover
that
if
there
was
nobody
else
who
could
tackle
thore
then
he
and
his
sons
would
try
it
knud
it
is
true
was
growing
old
but
although
he
was
nearly
sixty
he
would
at
times
have
a
wrestle
or
two
with
his
eldest
son
when
it
was
too
dull
for
him
at
some
party
or
other
up
to
the
huseby
sæter
there
was
but
one
road
and
that
led
straight
through
the
gard
the
next
saturday
evening
as
thore
was
going
to
the
sæter
and
was
stealing
on
his
tiptoes
across
the
yard
a
man
rushed
right
at
his
breast
as
he
came
near
the
barn
what
do
you
want
of
me
said
thore
and
knocked
his
assailant
flat
on
the
ground
that
you
shall
soon
find
out
said
another
fellow
from
behind
giving
thore
a
blow
on
the
back
of
the
head
this
was
the
brother
of
the
former
assailant
here
comes
the
third
said
old
knud
rushing
forward
to
join
the
fray
the
danger
made
thore
stronger
he
was
as
limber
as
a
willow
and
his
blows
left
their
marks
he
dodged
from
one
side
to
the
other
where
the
blows
fell
he
was
not
and
where
his
opponents
least
expected
blows
from
him
they
got
them
he
was
however
at
last
completely
beaten
but
old
knud
frequently
said
afterwards
that
a
stouter
fellow
he
had
scarcely
ever
tackled
the
fight
was
continued
until
blood
flowed
but
then
huseby
cried
stop
and
added
if
you
can
manage
to
get
by
the
huseby
wolf
and
his
cubs
next
saturday
night
the
girl
shall
be
yours
thore
dragged
himself
homeward
as
best
he
could
and
as
soon
as
he
got
home
he
went
to
bed
at
huseby
there
was
much
talk
about
the
fight
but
everybody
said
what
did
he
want
there
there
was
one
however
who
did
not
say
so
and
that
was
aslaug
she
had
expected
thore
that
saturday
night
and
when
she
heard
what
had
taken
place
between
him
and
her
father
she
sat
down
and
had
a
good
cry
saying
to
herself
if
i
can
not
have
thore
there
will
never
be
another
happy
day
for
me
in
this
world
thore
had
to
keep
his
bed
all
day
sunday
and
monday
too
he
felt
that
he
must
do
the
same
tuesday
came
and
it
was
such
a
beautiful
day
it
had
rained
during
the
night
the
mountain
was
wet
and
green
the
fragrance
of
the
leaves
was
wafted
in
through
the
open
window
down
the
mountain
sides
came
the
sound
of
the
and
some
one
was
heard
singing
up
in
the
glen
had
it
not
been
for
his
mother
who
was
sitting
in
the
room
thore
would
have
wept
from
impatient
vexation
wednesday
came
and
still
thore
was
in
bed
but
on
thursday
he
began
to
wonder
whether
he
could
not
get
well
by
saturday
and
on
friday
he
rose
he
remembered
well
the
words
aslaug
father
had
spoken
if
you
can
manage
to
get
by
the
huseby
wolf
and
his
cubs
next
saturday
the
girl
shall
be
yours
he
looked
over
toward
the
huseby
sæter
again
and
again
i
can
not
get
more
than
another
thrashing
thought
thore
up
to
the
huseby
sæter
there
was
but
one
road
as
before
stated
but
a
clever
fellow
might
manage
to
get
there
even
if
he
did
not
take
the
beaten
track
if
he
rowed
out
on
the
fjord
below
and
past
the
little
tongue
of
land
yonder
and
thus
reached
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
he
might
contrive
to
climb
it
though
it
was
so
steep
that
a
goat
could
scarcely
venture
there
and
a
goat
is
not
very
apt
to
be
timid
in
climbing
the
mountains
you
know
saturday
came
and
thore
stayed
without
doors
all
day
long
the
sunlight
played
upon
the
foliage
and
every
now
and
then
an
alluring
song
was
heard
from
the
mountains
as
evening
drew
near
and
the
mist
was
stealing
up
the
slope
he
was
still
sitting
outside
of
the
door
he
looked
up
the
mountain
and
all
was
still
he
looked
over
toward
the
huseby
gard
then
he
pushed
out
his
boat
and
rowed
round
the
point
of
land
up
at
the
sæter
sat
aslaug
through
with
her
day
work
she
was
thinking
that
thore
would
not
come
this
evening
but
that
there
would
come
all
the
more
in
his
stead
presently
she
let
loose
the
dog
but
told
no
one
whither
she
was
going
she
seated
herself
where
she
could
look
down
into
the
valley
but
a
dense
fog
was
rising
and
moreover
she
felt
little
disposed
to
look
down
that
way
for
everything
reminded
her
of
what
had
occurred
so
she
moved
and
without
thinking
what
she
was
doing
she
happened
to
go
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
and
there
she
sat
down
and
gazed
out
over
the
sea
there
was
so
much
peace
in
this
then
she
felt
like
singing
she
chose
a
song
with
long
notes
and
the
music
sounded
far
into
the
still
night
she
felt
gladdened
by
it
and
so
she
sang
another
verse
but
then
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
some
one
answered
her
from
the
glen
far
below
dear
me
what
can
that
be
thought
aslaug
she
went
forward
to
the
brink
of
the
precipice
and
threw
her
arms
around
a
slender
birch
which
hung
trembling
over
the
steep
she
looked
down
but
saw
nothing
the
fjord
lay
silent
and
calm
not
even
a
bird
ruffled
its
smooth
surface
aslaug
sat
down
and
began
singing
again
then
she
was
sure
that
some
one
responded
with
the
same
tune
and
nearer
than
the
first
time
it
must
be
somebody
after
all
aslaug
sprang
up
and
bent
out
over
the
brink
of
the
steep
and
there
down
at
the
foot
of
a
rocky
wall
she
saw
a
boat
moored
and
it
was
so
far
down
that
it
appeared
like
a
tiny
shell
she
looked
a
little
farther
up
and
her
eyes
fell
on
a
red
cap
and
under
the
cap
she
saw
a
young
man
who
was
working
his
way
up
the
almost
perpendicular
side
of
the
mountain
dear
me
who
can
that
be
asked
aslaug
as
she
let
go
of
the
birch
and
sprang
far
back
she
dared
not
answer
her
own
question
for
she
knew
very
well
who
it
was
she
threw
herself
down
on
the
greensward
and
took
hold
of
the
grass
with
both
hands
as
though
it
were
who
must
not
let
go
her
hold
but
the
grass
came
up
by
the
roots
she
cried
aloud
and
prayed
god
to
help
thore
but
then
it
struck
her
that
this
conduct
of
thore
was
really
tempting
god
and
therefore
no
help
could
be
expected
just
this
once
she
implored
and
she
threw
her
arms
around
the
dog
as
if
it
were
thore
she
were
keeping
from
loosing
his
hold
she
rolled
over
the
grass
with
him
and
the
moments
seemed
years
but
then
the
dog
tore
himself
away
he
barked
over
the
brink
of
the
steep
and
wagged
his
tail
he
barked
at
aslaug
and
threw
his
forepaws
up
on
her
over
the
precipice
again
and
a
red
cap
appeared
over
the
brow
of
the
mountain
and
thore
lay
in
her
arms
now
when
old
knud
huseby
heard
of
this
he
made
a
very
sensible
remark
for
he
said
that
boy
is
worth
having
the
girl
shall
be
his
the
bear
hunter
a
worse
boy
to
tell
lies
than
the
priest
oldest
son
could
scarcely
be
found
in
the
whole
parish
he
was
also
a
very
good
reader
there
was
no
lack
on
that
score
and
what
he
read
the
peasants
were
glad
to
hear
but
when
it
was
something
they
were
well
pleased
with
he
would
make
up
more
of
the
same
kind
as
much
as
he
thought
they
wanted
his
own
stories
were
mostly
about
strong
men
and
about
love
soon
the
priest
noticed
that
the
threshing
up
in
the
barn
was
being
done
in
a
more
and
more
lazy
manner
he
went
to
see
what
the
matter
was
and
behold
it
was
thorvald
who
stood
there
telling
stories
soon
the
quantity
of
wood
brought
home
from
the
forest
became
wonderfully
small
he
went
to
see
what
the
trouble
was
and
there
stood
thorvald
again
telling
stories
there
must
be
an
end
to
this
thought
the
priest
and
he
sent
the
boy
to
the
nearest
school
only
peasant
children
attended
this
school
but
the
priest
thought
it
would
be
too
expensive
to
keep
a
private
tutor
for
this
one
boy
but
thorvald
had
not
been
a
week
among
the
scholars
before
one
of
his
schoolmates
came
in
pale
as
a
corpse
and
said
he
had
met
some
of
the
underground
folk
coming
along
the
road
another
boy
still
paler
followed
and
said
that
he
had
actually
seen
a
man
without
a
head
walking
about
and
moving
the
boats
down
by
the
and
what
was
worst
of
all
little
knud
pladsen
and
his
young
sister
one
evening
as
they
were
returning
home
from
school
came
running
back
almost
out
of
their
senses
crying
and
declaring
that
they
had
heard
the
bear
up
near
the
parsonage
nay
little
marit
had
even
seen
his
gray
eyes
sparkle
but
now
the
got
terribly
angry
struck
the
table
with
his
ferule
and
asked
what
the
deuce
god
pardon
me
my
wicked
sin
had
gotten
into
the
one
is
growing
more
crazy
than
the
other
said
he
there
lurks
a
hulder
in
every
bush
there
sits
a
merman
under
every
boat
the
bear
is
out
in
midwinter
have
you
no
more
faith
in
your
god
or
in
your
catechism
quoth
he
or
do
you
believe
in
all
kinds
of
deviltry
and
in
all
the
terrible
powers
of
darkness
and
in
bears
roaming
about
in
the
middle
of
winter
but
then
he
calmed
down
somewhat
after
a
while
and
asked
little
marit
whether
she
really
did
not
dare
to
go
home
the
child
sobbed
and
cried
and
declared
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
the
then
said
that
thorvald
who
was
the
eldest
of
those
remaining
should
go
with
her
through
the
wood
no
he
has
seen
the
bear
himself
cried
marit
it
was
he
who
told
us
about
it
thorvald
shrank
within
himself
where
he
was
sitting
especially
when
the
looked
at
him
and
drew
the
ferule
affectionately
through
his
left
hand
have
you
seen
the
bear
he
asked
quietly
well
at
any
rate
i
know
said
thorvald
that
our
overseer
found
a
bear
den
up
in
the
priest
wood
the
day
he
was
out
ptarmigan
shooting
but
have
you
seen
the
bear
yourself
it
was
not
one
it
was
two
large
ones
and
perhaps
there
were
two
smaller
ones
besides
as
the
old
ones
generally
have
their
last
cubs
and
this
year
too
with
them
but
have
seen
them
reiterated
the
still
more
mildly
as
he
kept
drawing
the
ferule
between
his
fingers
thorvald
was
silent
for
a
moment
i
saw
the
bear
that
lars
the
hunter
felled
last
year
at
any
rate
then
the
came
a
step
nearer
and
asked
so
pleasantly
that
the
boy
became
frightened
have
you
seen
the
bears
up
in
the
parsonage
wood
i
ask
thorvald
did
not
say
another
word
perhaps
your
memory
did
not
serve
you
quite
right
this
time
said
the
taking
the
boy
by
the
jacket
collar
and
striking
his
own
side
with
the
ferule
thorvald
did
not
say
a
word
the
other
children
dared
not
look
that
way
then
the
said
earnestly
it
is
wicked
for
a
priest
son
to
tell
lies
and
still
more
wicked
to
teach
the
poor
peasant
children
to
do
such
things
and
so
the
boy
escaped
for
that
time
but
the
next
day
at
school
the
teacher
had
been
called
up
to
the
priest
and
the
children
were
left
to
themselves
marit
was
the
first
one
to
ask
thorvald
to
tell
her
something
about
the
bear
again
but
you
get
so
frightened
said
he
oh
i
think
i
will
have
to
stand
it
said
she
and
moved
closer
to
her
brother
ah
now
you
had
better
believe
it
will
be
shot
said
thorvald
and
nodded
his
head
there
has
come
a
fellow
to
the
parish
who
is
able
to
shoot
it
no
sooner
had
lars
the
hunter
heard
about
the
bear
den
up
in
the
parsonage
wood
than
he
came
running
through
seven
whole
parishes
with
a
rifle
as
heavy
as
the
upper
and
as
long
as
from
here
to
hans
volden
who
sits
yonder
mercy
cried
all
the
children
as
long
repeated
thorvald
yes
it
is
certainly
as
long
as
from
here
to
yonder
bench
have
you
seen
it
asked
ole
böen
have
i
seen
it
do
you
say
why
i
have
been
helping
to
clean
it
and
that
is
what
lars
will
not
allow
everybody
to
do
let
me
tell
you
of
course
could
not
lift
it
but
that
made
no
difference
i
only
cleaned
the
lock
and
that
is
not
the
easiest
work
i
can
tell
you
people
say
that
gun
of
lars
has
taken
to
missing
its
mark
of
late
said
hans
volden
leaning
back
with
both
his
feet
on
the
desk
ever
since
that
time
when
lars
shot
up
at
osmark
at
a
bear
that
was
asleep
it
misses
fire
twice
and
misses
the
mark
the
third
time
yes
ever
since
he
shot
at
a
bear
that
was
asleep
chimed
in
the
girls
the
fool
added
the
boys
there
is
only
one
way
in
which
this
difficulty
with
the
rifle
can
be
remedied
said
ole
böen
and
that
is
to
thrust
a
living
snake
down
its
barrel
yes
we
all
know
that
said
the
girls
they
wanted
to
hear
something
new
it
is
now
winter
and
snakes
are
not
to
be
found
and
so
lars
can
not
depend
very
much
upon
his
rifle
said
hans
volden
thoughtfully
he
wants
niels
böen
along
with
him
does
he
not
asked
thorvald
yes
said
the
boy
from
böen
who
was
of
course
best
posted
in
regard
to
this
but
niels
will
get
permission
neither
from
his
mother
nor
from
his
sister
his
father
certainly
died
from
the
wrestle
he
had
with
the
bear
up
at
the
sæter
last
year
and
now
they
have
no
one
but
niels
is
it
so
dangerous
then
asked
a
little
boy
dangerous
cried
thorvald
the
bear
has
as
much
sense
as
ten
men
and
as
much
strength
as
twelve
yes
we
know
that
said
the
girls
once
more
they
were
bent
on
hearing
something
new
but
niels
is
like
his
father
i
dare
say
he
will
go
along
continued
thorvald
of
course
he
will
go
along
said
ole
böen
this
morning
early
before
any
one
was
stirring
over
yonder
at
our
gard
i
saw
niels
böen
lars
the
hunter
and
one
man
more
going
up
the
mountain
with
their
rifles
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
they
were
going
to
the
parsonage
wood
was
it
early
asked
the
children
in
concert
very
early
i
was
up
before
mother
and
started
the
fire
did
lars
have
the
long
rifle
asked
hans
that
i
do
not
know
but
the
one
he
had
was
as
long
as
from
here
to
the
chair
oh
what
a
story
said
thorvald
why
you
said
so
yourself
answered
ole
no
the
long
rifle
which
i
saw
he
will
scarcely
use
any
more
well
this
one
was
at
all
events
as
long
as
long
as
from
here
nearly
over
to
the
chair
ah
perhaps
he
had
it
with
him
then
after
all
just
think
said
marit
now
they
are
up
among
the
bears
and
at
this
very
moment
they
may
be
in
a
fight
said
thorvald
then
followed
a
deep
nay
almost
solemn
silence
i
think
i
will
go
said
thorvald
taking
his
cap
yes
yes
then
you
will
find
out
something
shouted
all
the
rest
and
they
became
full
of
life
again
but
the
said
he
and
stopped
nonsense
you
are
the
priest
son
said
ole
böen
yes
if
the
touches
me
with
a
finger
said
thorvald
with
a
significant
nod
in
the
midst
of
the
deep
silence
of
the
rest
will
you
hit
him
back
asked
they
eagerly
who
knows
said
thorvald
nodding
and
went
away
they
thought
it
best
to
study
while
he
was
gone
but
none
of
them
were
able
to
do
so
they
had
to
keep
talking
about
the
bear
they
began
guessing
how
the
affair
would
turn
out
hans
bet
with
ole
that
rifle
had
missed
fire
and
that
the
bear
had
sprung
at
him
little
knud
pladsen
thought
they
had
all
fared
badly
and
the
girls
took
his
side
but
there
came
thorvald
let
us
go
said
he
as
he
pulled
open
the
door
so
excited
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
but
the
asked
some
of
the
children
the
deuce
take
the
the
bear
the
bear
cried
thorvald
and
could
say
no
more
is
it
shot
asked
one
very
softly
and
the
others
dared
not
draw
their
breath
thorvald
sat
panting
for
a
while
finally
he
got
up
mounted
one
of
the
benches
swung
his
cap
and
shouted
let
us
go
i
say
i
will
take
all
the
responsibility
but
where
shall
we
go
asked
hans
the
largest
bear
has
been
borne
down
the
others
still
remain
niels
böen
has
been
badly
hurt
because
lars
rifle
missed
its
mark
and
the
bears
rushed
straight
at
them
the
boy
who
went
with
them
saved
himself
only
by
throwing
himself
flat
on
the
ground
and
pretending
to
be
dead
and
the
bear
did
not
touch
him
as
soon
as
lars
and
niels
had
killed
their
bear
they
shot
his
also
hurrah
hurrah
shouted
all
both
girls
and
boys
and
up
from
their
seats
and
out
through
the
door
they
sprang
and
off
they
ran
over
field
and
wood
to
böen
as
though
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
in
the
whole
world
the
girls
soon
complained
that
they
were
not
able
to
keep
up
but
the
boys
took
them
by
the
hand
and
away
they
all
rushed
take
care
not
to
touch
it
said
thorvald
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
bears
become
alive
again
is
that
so
asked
marit
yes
and
they
appear
in
a
new
form
so
have
a
care
and
they
kept
running
lars
shot
the
largest
one
ten
times
before
it
fell
he
began
again
just
think
ten
times
and
they
kept
running
and
niels
stabbed
it
eighteen
times
with
his
knife
before
it
fell
mercy
what
a
bear
and
the
children
ran
so
that
the
sweat
poured
down
from
their
faces
finally
they
reached
the
place
ole
böen
pushed
the
door
open
and
got
in
first
have
a
care
cried
hans
after
him
marit
and
a
little
girl
that
thorvald
and
hans
had
led
between
them
were
the
next
ones
and
then
came
thorvald
who
did
not
go
far
forward
but
remained
standing
where
he
could
observe
the
whole
scene
see
the
blood
said
he
to
hans
the
others
hardly
knew
whether
they
should
venture
in
just
yet
do
you
see
it
asked
a
girl
of
a
boy
who
stood
by
her
side
in
the
door
yes
it
is
as
large
as
the
captain
large
horse
answered
he
and
went
on
talking
to
her
it
was
bound
with
iron
chains
he
said
and
had
even
broken
the
one
that
had
been
put
about
its
he
could
see
distinctly
that
it
was
alive
and
the
blood
was
flowing
from
it
like
a
waterfall
of
course
this
was
not
true
but
they
forgot
that
when
they
caught
sight
of
the
bear
the
rifle
and
niels
who
sat
there
with
bandaged
wounds
after
the
fight
with
the
bear
and
when
they
heard
old
lars
the
hunter
tell
how
all
had
happened
so
eagerly
and
with
so
much
interest
did
they
look
and
listen
that
they
did
not
observe
that
some
one
came
behind
them
who
also
began
to
tell
his
story
and
that
in
the
following
manner
i
will
teach
you
to
leave
the
school
without
my
permission
that
i
will
a
cry
of
fright
arose
from
the
whole
crowd
and
out
through
the
door
through
the
veranda
and
out
into
the
yard
they
ran
soon
they
appeared
like
a
lot
of
black
balls
rolling
one
by
one
over
the
field
and
when
the
on
his
old
legs
followed
them
to
the
he
could
hear
the
children
reading
from
afar
off
they
read
until
the
walls
fairly
rattled
aye
that
was
a
glorious
day
the
day
when
the
came
home
it
began
in
sunshine
and
ended
in
rain
but
such
days
are
usually
the
best
growing
days
the
father
the
man
whose
story
is
here
to
be
told
was
the
wealthiest
and
most
influential
person
in
his
parish
his
name
was
thord
överaas
he
appeared
in
the
priest
study
one
day
tall
and
earnest
i
have
gotten
a
son

he
and
i
wish
to
present
him
for
baptism

his
name

finn
after
my
father
and
the
sponsors

were
mentioned
and
proved
to
be
the
best
men
and
women
of
relations
in
the
parish
is
there

else
inquired
the
priest
and
looked
up
the
peasant
hesitated
a
little
i
should
like
very
much
to
have
him
baptized
by
himself
said
he
finally
that
is
to
say
on
a
next
saturday
at
twelve
noon
is
there
anything
else
inquired
the
priest
there
is
nothing
else
and
the
peasant
twirled
his
cap
as
though
he
were
about
to
go
then
the
priest
rose
there
is
yet
this
however
said
he
and
walking
toward
thord
he
took
him
by
the
hand
and
looked
gravely
into
his
eyes
god
grant
that
the
child
may
become
a
blessing
to
you
one
day
sixteen
years
later
thord
stood
once
more
in
the
study
really
you
carry
your
age
astonishingly
well
thord
said
the
priest
for
he
saw
no
change
whatever
in
the
man
that
is
because
i
have
no
troubles
replied
thord
to
this
the
priest
said
nothing
but
after
a
while
he
asked
what
is
your
pleasure

have
come
this
evening
about
that
son
of
mine
who
is
to
be
confirmed
he
is
a
bright
boy
i
did
not
wish
to
pay
the
priest
until
i
heard
what
number
the
boy
would
have
when
he
takes
his
place
in
church
he
will
stand
number
one
so
i
have

and
here

ten
dollars
for
the
priest

can
do
for
you
inquired
the
priest
fixing
his
eyes
on
thord
there
is
nothing
else
thord
went
out
eight
years
more
rolled
by
and
then
one
day
a
noise
was
heard
outside
of
the
priest
study
for
many
men
were
approaching
and
at
their
head
was
thord
who
entered
first
the
priest
looked
up
and
recognized
him
you
come
well
attended
this
evening
thord
said
he
i
am
here
to
request
that
the
bans
may
be
published
for
my
son
he
is
about
to
marry
karen
storliden
daughter
of
gudmund
who
stands
here
beside
me
why
that
is
the
richest
girl
in
the
parish
so
they
say
replied
the
peasant
stroking
back
his
hair
with
one
hand
the
priest
sat
a
while
as
if
in
deep
thought
then
entered
the
names
in
his
book
without
making
any
comments
and
the
men
wrote
their
signatures
underneath
thord
laid
three
dollars
on
the
table
one
is
all
i
am
to
have
said
the
priest
i
know
that
very
well
but
he
is
my
only
child
i
want
to
do
it
handsomely
the
priest
took
the
money
this
is
now
the
third
time
thord
that
you
have
come
here
on
your
son
account
but
now
i
am
through
with
him
said
thord
and
folding
up
his
he
said
farewell
and
walked
away
the
men
slowly
followed
him
a
fortnight
later
the
father
and
son
were
rowing
across
the
lake
one
calm
still
day
to
storliden
to
make
arrangements
for
the
wedding
this
thwart
is
not
secure
said
the
son
and
stood
up
to
straighten
the
seat
on
which
he
was
sitting
at
the
same
moment
the
board
he
was
standing
on
slipped
from
under
him
he
threw
out
his
arms
uttered
a
shriek
and
fell
overboard
take
hold
of
the
oar
shouted
the
father
springing
to
his
feet
and
holding
out
the
oar
but
when
the
son
had
made
a
couple
of
efforts
he
grew
stiff
wait
a
moment
cried
the
father
and
began
to
row
toward
his
son
then
the
son
rolled
over
on
his
back
gave
his
father
one
long
look
and
sank
thord
could
scarcely
believe
it
he
held
the
boat
still
and
stared
at
the
spot
where
his
son
had
gone
down
as
though
he
must
surely
come
to
the
surface
again
there
rose
some
bubbles
then
some
more
and
finally
one
large
one
that
burst
and
the
lake
lay
there
as
smooth
and
bright
as
a
mirror
again
for
three
days
and
three
nights
people
saw
the
father
rowing
round
and
round
the
spot
without
taking
either
food
or
sleep
he
was
dragging
the
lake
for
the
body
of
his
son
and
toward
morning
of
the
third
day
he
found
it
and
carried
it
in
his
arms
up
over
the
hills
to
his
gard
it
might
have
been
about
a
year
from
that
day
when
the
priest
late
one
autumn
evening
heard
some
one
in
the
passage
outside
of
the
door
carefully
trying
to
find
the
latch
the
priest
opened
the
door
and
in
walked
a
tall
thin
man
with
bowed
form
and
white
hair
the
priest
looked
long
at
him
before
he
recognized
him
it
was
thord
are
you
out
walking
so
late
said
the
priest
and
stood
still
in
front
of
him
ah
yes
it
is
late
said
thord
and
took
a
seat
the
priest
sat
down
also
as
though
waiting
a
long
long
silence
followed
at
last
thord
said
i
have
something
with
me
that
i
should
like
to
give
to
the
poor
i
want
it
to
be
in
vested
as
a
legacy
in
my
son
name
he
rose
laid
some
money
on
the
table
and
sat
down
again
the
priest
counted
it
it
is
a
great
deal
of
money
said
he
it
is
half
the
price
of
my
gard
i
sold
it
the
priest
sat
long
in
silence
at
last
he
asked
but
gently
what
do
you
propose
to
do
now
thord
something
better
they
sat
there
for
a
while
thord
with
downcast
eyes
the
priest
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
thord
presently
the
priest
said
slowly
and
softly
i
think
your
son
has
at
last
brought
you
a
true
blessing
yes
i
think
so
myself
said
thord
looking
up
while
two
big
tears
coursed
slowly
down
his
cheeks
the
eagle
nest
the
endregards
was
the
name
of
a
small
solitary
parish
surrounded
by
lofty
mountains
it
lay
in
a
flat
and
fertile
valley
and
was
intersected
by
a
broad
river
that
flowed
down
from
the
mountains
this
river
emptied
into
a
lake
which
was
situated
close
by
the
parish
and
presented
a
fine
view
of
the
surrounding
country
up
the
the
man
had
come
rowing
who
had
first
cleared
this
valley
his
name
was
endre
and
it
was
his
descendants
who
dwelt
here
some
said
he
had
fled
hither
on
account
of
a
murder
he
had
committed
and
that
was
why
his
family
were
so
dark
others
said
this
was
on
account
of
the
mountains
which
shut
out
the
sun
at
five
of
a
midsummer
afternoon
over
this
parish
there
hung
an
eagle
nest
it
was
built
on
a
cliff
far
up
the
mountains
all
could
see
the
mother
eagle
alight
in
her
nest
but
no
one
could
reach
it
the
male
eagle
went
sailing
over
the
parish
now
swooping
down
after
a
lamb
now
after
a
kid
once
he
had
also
taken
a
little
child
and
borne
it
away
therefore
there
was
no
safety
in
the
parish
as
long
as
the
eagle
had
a
nest
in
this
mountain
there
was
a
tradition
among
the
people
that
in
old
times
there
were
two
brothers
who
had
climbed
up
to
the
nest
and
torn
it
down
but
nowadays
there
was
no
one
who
was
able
to
reach
it
whenever
two
met
at
the
endregards
they
talked
about
the
eagle
nest
and
looked
up
every
one
knew
when
the
eagles
reappeared
in
the
new
year
where
they
had
swooped
down
and
done
mischief
and
who
had
last
endeavored
to
reach
the
nest
the
youth
of
the
place
from
early
boyhood
practiced
climbing
mountains
and
trees
wrestling
and
scuffling
in
order
that
one
day
they
might
reach
the
cliff
and
demolish
the
nest
as
those
two
brothers
had
done
at
the
time
of
which
this
story
tells
the
best
boy
at
the
endregards
was
named
leif
and
he
was
not
of
the
endre
family
he
had
curly
hair
and
small
eyes
was
clever
in
all
play
and
was
fond
of
the
fair
sex
he
early
said
of
himself
that
one
day
he
would
reach
the
eagle
nest
but
old
people
remarked
that
he
should
not
have
said
so
aloud
this
annoyed
him
and
even
before
he
had
reached
his
prime
he
made
the
ascent
it
was
one
bright
sunday
forenoon
early
in
the
summer
the
young
eagles
must
be
just
about
hatched
a
vast
multitude
of
people
had
gathered
together
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
to
behold
the
feat
the
old
people
advising
him
against
attempting
it
the
young
ones
urging
him
on
but
he
hearkened
only
to
his
own
desires
and
waiting
until
the
mother
eagle
left
her
nest
he
gave
one
spring
into
the
air
and
hung
in
a
tree
several
yards
from
the
ground
the
tree
grew
in
a
cleft
in
the
rock
and
from
this
cleft
he
began
to
climb
upward
small
stones
loosened
under
his
feet
earth
and
gravel
came
rolling
down
otherwise
all
was
still
save
for
the
stream
flowing
behind
with
its
suppressed
ceaseless
murmur
soon
he
had
reached
a
point
where
the
mountain
began
to
project
here
he
hung
long
by
one
hand
while
his
foot
groped
for
a
sure
for
he
could
not
see
many
especially
women
turned
away
saying
he
would
never
have
done
this
had
he
had
parents
living
he
found
footing
at
last
however
sought
again
now
with
the
hand
now
with
the
foot
failed
slipped
then
hung
fast
again
they
who
stood
below
could
hear
one
another
breathing
suddenly
there
rose
to
her
feet
a
tall
young
girl
who
had
been
sitting
on
a
stone
apart
from
the
rest
it
was
said
that
she
had
been
betrothed
to
leif
from
early
childhood
although
he
was
not
of
her
kindred
stretching
out
her
arms
she
called
aloud
leif
leif
why
do
you
do
this
every
eye
was
turned
on
her
her
father
who
was
standing
close
by
gave
her
a
stern
look
but
she
heeded
him
not
come
down
again
leif
she
cried
i
love
you
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
up
there
they
could
see
that
he
was
considering
he
hesitated
a
moment
or
two
and
then
started
onward
for
a
long
time
all
went
well
for
he
was
and
had
a
strong
grip
but
after
a
while
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
growing
weary
for
he
often
paused
presently
a
little
stone
came
rolling
down
as
a
harbinger
and
every
one
who
stood
there
had
to
watch
its
course
to
the
bottom
some
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
went
away
the
girl
alone
still
stood
on
the
stone
and
wringing
her
hands
continued
to
gaze
upward
once
more
leif
took
hold
with
one
hand
but
it
slipped
she
saw
this
distinctly
then
he
tried
the
other
it
slipped
also
leif
she
shouted
so
loud
that
her
voice
rang
through
the
mountains
and
all
the
others
chimed
in
with
her
he
is
slipping
they
cried
and
stretched
up
their
hands
to
him
both
men
and
women
he
was
indeed
slipping
carrying
with
him
sand
stones
and
earth
slipping
continually
slipping
ever
faster
and
faster
the
people
turned
away
and
then
they
heard
a
rustling
and
scraping
in
the
mountain
behind
them
after
which
something
fell
with
a
heavy
thud
like
a
great
piece
of
wet
earth
when
they
could
look
round
again
he
was
lying
there
crushed
and
mutilated
beyond
recognition
the
girl
had
fallen
down
on
the
stone
and
her
father
took
her
up
in
his
arms
and
bore
her
away
the
youths
who
had
taken
the
most
pains
to
incite
leif
to
the
perilous
ascent
now
dared
not
lend
a
hand
to
pick
him
up
some
were
even
unable
to
look
at
him
so
the
old
people
had
to
go
forward
the
eldest
of
them
as
he
took
hold
of
the
body
said
it
is
very
sad
but
he
added
casting
a
look
upward
it
is
after
all
well
that
something
hangs
so
high
that
it
can
not
be
reached
by
every
one
