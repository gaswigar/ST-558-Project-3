for

it
was
the
end
was
bound
to
happen
sooner
or
because
man
failed
to
understand
his
fellow
man
but
because
he
failed
to
understand
wasn
t
much
left
afterwards
after
the
golden
showers
of
deadly
dust
and
the
blinding
flashes
that
blotted
out
the
light
from
the
all
because
man
continued
to
confuse
emotion
with
somehow
as
before
man
survived
t
touch
sinzor
s
command
shot
through
the
chill
morning
air
like
an
arrow
the
ragged
little
group
of
men
stopped
dead
in
their
tracks
and
looked
questioningly
at
their
leader
he
was
pointing
down
to
an
object
lying
in
the
soil
at
his
feet
another
maybe
sinzor
said
another
our
ancestors
made
with
which
to
destroy
themselves
he
peered
around
the
of
men
until
he
spotted
the
aged
one
with
a
leg
missing
morge
see
that
this
place
is
marked
forbidden
the
hunting
party
moved
on
and
morge
stayed
behind
he
hobbled
about
collecting
sticks
and
stones
arranging
them
in
the
way
to
form
a
barrier
around
the
it
was
because
of
such
a
that
he
d
lost
a
leg
in
his
youth
he
both
hated
and
feared
the
his
ancestors
had
so
carelessly
left
lying
about
before
they
vanished
but
that
wasn
t
right
morge
scratched
his
grizzly
old
head
and
thought
hard
according
to
builder
wisest
of
their
tribe
their
ancestors
hadn
t
all
vanished
some
of
them
had
become
the
tribe
sinzor
builder
and
even
old
morge
very
puzzling
but
it
was
all
because
of
the
puffing
morge
completed
the
barrier
then
turned
for
a
last
look
at
the
gleaming
dully
in
the
pale
winter
sunlight
how
strange
it
looked
in
no
way
did
it
resemble
the
usual
most
of
which
were
long
and
round
with
little
wings
attached
this
one
was
different
like
nothing
he
d
ever
seen
before
it
was
boxlike
with
strange
arms
sticking
up
and
under
the
arms
was
a
shelf
or
platform
resembling
vaguely
the
upper
portion
of
two
legs
the
terrified
morge
for
a
moment
then
in
order
to
prove
his
courage
to
himself
he
stepped
forward
and
spat
on
it
nothing
happened
sneering
he
spat
on
it
again
and
watched
his
spittle
slowly
run
down
its
side
over
a
strange
marking
like
a
thunderbolt
thunderbolt
suddenly
morge
fell
grovelling
to
his
one
good
knee
it
was
thor
god
of
thunder
and
lightning
and
god
of
the
tribe
he
had
spat
on
thor
for
nearly
an
hour
he
knelt
there
praying
forgiveness
for
his
sacrilege
then
trembling
he
tore
off
a
piece
of
his
goatskin
and
wiped
the
spittle
off
thor
s
side
carefully
began
to
uncover
the
remainder
of
thor
finally
he
lifted
thor
out
of
the
hole
and
onto
level
ground
kneeling
once
more
he
took
a
small
from
his
belt
and
placed
it
before
thor
then
he
pulled
out
his
knife
and
folded
his
single
leg
under
him
bending
over
he
cut
a
gash
in
his
wrist
and
let
the
blood
flow
into
the
scoop
until
it
was
nearly
full
rising
to
his
knee
he
said
oh
thor
please
take
this
humble
offering
to
show
that
i
am
forgiven
almost
prostrate
now
he
picked
up
the
scoop
and
placed
it
on
thor
s
lap
beneath
his
arms
immediately
there
was
a
soft
rumble
and
humming
fearfully
old
morge
watched
thor
s
arms
come
down
lift
up
the
scoop
and
carry
it
inside
his
huge
mouth
there
was
a
sucking
noise
and
the
scoop
was
returned
empty
to
his
lap
filled
with
joy
morge
spent
another
endless
time
thanking
thor
then
all
of
a
sudden
an
idea
seized
him
what
if
he
carried
thor
back
to
the
tribe
and
presented
him
to
the
priest
thougor
for
all
to
worship
and
give
sacrifices
to
would
not
he
the
despised
the
looked
down
upon
be
the
greatest
of
heroes
all
that
was
known
of
thor
were
the
legends
but
at
last
they
would
have
the
actual
god
painfully
with
many
grunts
and
groans
he
got
thor
under
one
arm
and
staggered
off
towards
the
village
his
crutch
kicking
up
little
puffs
of
dust
builder
was
having
trouble
with
thougor
he
almost
wished
now
that
he
d
continued
his
search
a
little
longer
for
a
segment
of
humanity
he
might
have
found
a
group
less
primitive
who
would
have
appreciated
and
understood
his
help
much
better
but
this
was
the
best
he
d
found
as
it
was
he
d
wandered
over
the
continent
nearly
a
lifetime
before
even
finding
these
poor
wretches
but
they
were
at
least
human
something
that
couldn
t
be
said
for
those
he
d
come
in
contact
with
all
through
the
past
years
and
now
after
having
been
with
the
tribe
the
only
human
tribe
for
over
a
year
he
was
being
balked
by
this
priest
which
meant
being
balked
at
setting
up
truth
and
knowledge
as
the
only
true
gods
of
humanity
being
balked
at
getting
the
dam
built
before
the
spring
rains
so
that
there
would
not
be
another
summer
drouth
followed
by
a
winter
of
famine
such
as
they
had
just
passed
through
the
dam
was
his
first
big
project
without
freedom
from
want
there
would
be
little
progress
next
winter
almost
savagely
he
turned
on
thougor
but
why
must
you
have
this
religious
festival
because
of
the
finding
of
the
god
thor
came
thougor
s
cold
answer
why
the
offerings
of
blood
can
t
they
wait
the
dam
be
finished
before
the
rains
but
the
loss
of
blood
already
has
so
weakened
the
workers
that
they
can
no
longer
work
for
a
full
day
which
is
more
important
worldly
or
spiritual
things
thougor
replied
but
there
maybe
won
t
be
anyone
around
to
indulge
in
spiritual
things
if
there
s
another
drouth
this
year
thor
will
see
to
it
that
there
is
not
another
drouth
yes
i
know
but
wouldn
t
it
be
wiser
to
be
on
the
safe
side
suppose
somebody
does
something
to
displease
thor
nobody
will
displease
thor
it
is
my
duty
to
see
to
that
i
tell
them
what
to
think
so
that
they
won
t
displease
thor
crafty
devil
you
builder
thought
this
image
of
thor
you
talk
about
so
that
it
will
take
the
blood
offerings
of
the
people
and
even
you
and
that
discipline
of
yours
morge
i
must
look
at
your
god
thor
one
of
these
days
he
suddenly
felt
very
weary
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
looking
up
at
thougor
he
said
but
that
is
not
part
of
being
civilized
to
tell
the
people
to
think
you
must
them
think
without
telling
them
what
to
think
and
with
the
dam
next
winter
there
will
be
freedom
from
want
for
the
first
time
the
tribe
will
have
a
chance
to
think
and
be
on
the
road
to
civilization
the
tribe
has
already
found
civilization
in
finding
thor
by
worshipping
him
as
a
group
they
have
already
ceased
their
bickering
and
quarreling
does
not
that
fit
in
with
your
definition
of
civilization
the
one
you
gave
my
people
when
you
first
came
to
us
since
the
coming
of
thor
we
have
begun
to
cooperate
have
we
not
no
hardly
at
all
i
said
civilization
is
cooperation
among
men
in
adapting
to
environment
which
includes
man
the
two
men
stared
at
each
other
and
for
awhile
there
was
silence
nevertheless
thougor
finally
said
thor
and
blood
offerings
continue
builder
watched
thougor
turn
and
stalk
out
of
the
tiny
hovel
that
housed
his
plans
and
his
work
himself
and
his
dreams
what
could
he
do
he
could
only
appeal
to
the
tribe
s
reason
thougor
could
appeal
to
their
emotions
which
were
far
stronger
but
unless
emotion
was
controlled
used
wisely
there
could
never
be
any
reason
builder
realized
with
a
sinking
heart
that
he
was
much
too
old
for
the
job
he
d
undertaken
too
late
in
life
had
he
discovered
these
people
almost
all
his
energy
since
youth
had
been
sapped
just
looking
for
a
segment
of
humanity
his
mother
and
father
had
told
him
there
might
be
failure
but
still
they
had
taught
him
everything
they
could
in
the
short
time
before
death
had
overtaken
them
they
had
been
the
only
humans
living
in
that
towering
jungle
of
concrete
and
steel
how
they
had
gotten
there
was
never
explained
to
him
it
didn
t
matter
though
suddenly
builder
shook
himself
here
he
was
recollecting
his
youth
instead
of
concentrating
on
the
task
at
hand
he
must
be
getting
old
he
was
glad
of
thougor
s
visit
at
least
he
was
now
fully
aware
of
the
problem
to
be
solved
in
spite
of
the
priest
he
had
to
find
a
way
of
getting
that
dam
finished
and
soon
or
maybe
next
year
there
wouldn
t
be
any
people
for
game
was
getting
scarcer
each
winter
very
little
work
was
done
that
day
in
spite
of
builder
s
managing
to
round
up
his
full
crew
the
blood
offering
each
worker
had
given
the
night
before
had
left
them
tired
and
listless
only
four
of
the
molds
running
across
the
river
were
filled
with
sand
and
gravel
that
morning
and
afternoon
there
were
still
nearly
fifty
to
be
filled
builder
was
very
depressed
but
he
was
even
more
depressed
when
at
the
close
of
day
two
workmen
grew
careless
and
slipped
into
the
last
mold
being
filled
their
shrieks
brought
half
the
tribe
up
over
the
hill
above
the
village
and
down
to
the
dam
sight
after
builder
explained
what
had
happened
there
were
angry
mutterings
to
the
effect
that
thor
was
displeased
with
the
dam
and
therefore
had
taken
lives
nothing
builder
could
say
would
dissuade
them
from
this
notion
so
well
had
thougor
indoctrinated
them
with
religious
fear
of
anything
used
to
control
nature
builder
hadn
t
realized
until
that
moment
just
how
much
the
people
were
against
the
dam
then
he
saw
thougor
tall
and
ominous
in
his
cloak
of
black
skins
come
striding
through
the
crowd
for
a
moment
he
stood
facing
them
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
there
seemed
to
be
a
silent
understanding
between
them
slowly
the
crowd
turned
and
disappeared
over
the
hill
then
thougor
strode
over
to
builder
and
said
simply
there
will
be
no
more
dam
turning
he
followed
the
rest
of
the
tribe
back
to
the
village
builder
was
thunderstruck
he
knew
there
was
no
use
arguing
or
trying
to
reason
with
either
thougor
or
the
tribe
it
was
too
late
for
that
only
some
drastic
measure
would
complete
the
dam
now
he
walked
tiredly
over
the
black
hill
and
down
to
his
shack
wondering
how
he
could
compete
with
an
idol
he
realized
now
it
had
been
foolish
of
him
to
have
overlooked
the
possible
effect
thor
might
have
upon
the
tribe
when
it
had
been
found
three
months
ago
he
never
dreamed
they
would
spend
all
their
leisure
in
rituals
the
god
was
his
problem
therefore
he
must
get
it
out
of
the
way
himself
without
expecting
help
from
anyone
each
evening
the
clouds
on
the
northern
horizon
were
darkening
and
drawing
closer
it
was
night
when
builder
finally
stumbled
into
his
quarters
after
lighting
a
pine
torch
he
sat
down
by
his
workbench
and
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
he
was
too
tired
and
upset
to
eat
which
was
just
as
well
outside
of
deliberately
killing
thougor
there
was
only
one
thing
he
could
do
that
was
to
kidnap
thor
with
this
realization
in
spite
of
the
risk
involved
came
some
peace
of
mind
he
hadn
t
the
vaguest
idea
just
how
he
was
to
go
about
it
especially
since
his
strength
was
failing
him
but
do
it
he
would
first
though
he
would
have
to
wait
until
sometime
before
dawn
when
everybody
even
thougor
was
sure
to
be
asleep
the
hours
dragged
heavily
between
then
and
his
chosen
time
many
were
the
times
when
he
longed
for
something
to
read
although
he
supposed
that
by
this
time
he
d
forgotten
how
like
wisps
of
smoke
memories
of
his
youth
in
the
concrete
jungle
drifted
through
his
mind
how
long
ago
that
all
seemed
now
sometimes
he
wondered
if
any
of
it
had
been
real
but
here
he
was
as
his
parents
had
wished
him
to
be
trying
to
help
what
was
left
of
humanity
back
up
the
trail
to
what
he
wondered
to
destruction
again
this
time
probably
complete
and
final
he
shook
his
old
head
and
ran
a
trembling
hand
through
his
white
shaggy
hair
he
d
gotten
this
far
somehow
he
would
get
the
rest
of
the
way
builder
got
up
and
crossed
over
to
his
sleeping
pile
after
tying
several
skins
together
he
folded
them
under
his
arm
and
walked
out
into
the
night
his
bones
felt
the
crackling
cold
of
early
spring
as
they
had
never
felt
it
before
slowly
he
made
his
way
around
the
village
to
where
thor
was
housed
under
a
huge
slanting
roof
of
bark
and
scraped
skins
he
d
never
seen
thor
and
now
wished
he
d
paid
at
least
one
visit
to
the
god
like
a
shadow
he
glided
carefully
through
the
blackness
in
back
of
the
temple
until
he
was
just
inside
the
rear
opening
he
could
see
clear
across
the
chamber
out
into
the
pale
twinkling
stars
then
he
detected
a
dark
mass
in
the
center
of
the
temple
silhouetted
against
the
stars
that
must
be
thor
swiftly
builder
advanced
towards
it
until
his
foot
struck
something
soft
causing
him
to
stumble
and
fall
as
he
did
so
he
heard
a
grunt
sounding
like
someone
being
kicked
in
the
stomach
then
something
was
on
top
of
him
pounding
his
head
and
shoulders
with
a
heavy
stick
of
some
kind
old
builder
knew
he
didn
t
have
the
strength
to
wrestle
he
managed
to
get
his
pile
of
skins
unfolded
and
with
his
last
ounce
of
strength
throw
them
over
the
head
of
his
attacker
somehow
he
managed
to
wiggle
out
from
underneath
and
climb
to
his
feet
his
assailant
began
to
scream
for
help
but
the
heavy
skins
muffled
his
shouts
quickly
builder
looked
around
for
something
to
hit
him
with
the
only
thing
his
eye
spotted
was
the
idol
he
hobbled
over
and
using
both
arms
dragged
it
off
its
dias
then
with
the
remainder
of
his
strength
dropped
it
squarely
on
top
of
whomever
was
under
the
skins
there
was
a
muted
clunk
followed
by
silence
fearfully
builder
stood
there
for
a
moment
catching
his
breath
and
listening
for
anyone
coming
all
was
quiet
except
the
pounding
of
his
heart
as
fast
as
he
could
make
his
arms
and
hands
work
he
rolled
up
the
body
in
the
skins
and
painfully
hoisted
it
over
one
shoulder
with
his
other
hand
he
reached
down
and
picked
thor
up
by
one
of
its
arms
then
staggering
under
the
load
he
started
back
the
way
he
had
come
except
for
a
greyish
streak
in
the
east
it
was
still
dark
he
stumbled
and
fell
several
times
before
reaching
his
dwelling
but
he
was
confident
that
he
had
left
no
tracks
every
night
even
this
late
in
the
winter
the
ground
froze
solid
back
inside
his
shed
still
in
the
dark
builder
unrolled
his
burden
and
listened
for
any
heartbeat
there
was
none
as
he
rolled
the
body
up
again
something
clattered
to
the
floor
it
was
a
crutch
quickly
he
felt
for
his
victim
s
legs
one
was
missing
of
all
the
people
he
had
to
kill
morge
thougor
s
right
hand
man
he
realized
he
had
to
get
rid
of
the
body
before
daylight
and
fast
already
more
grey
was
lining
the
eastern
horizon
he
didn
t
know
whether
he
had
the
strength
to
do
it
or
not
but
he
had
to
get
morge
up
to
the
dam
and
into
one
of
the
unfilled
molds
for
the
time
being
he
would
have
to
hide
thor
someplace
inside
here
he
couldn
t
carry
both
of
them
up
to
the
dam
he
rolled
the
idol
up
in
another
set
of
skins
and
placed
it
under
the
head
of
his
sleeping
pile
then
picking
up
his
other
bundle
once
more
he
started
for
the
dam
the
sun
was
just
peeking
over
the
horizon
when
builder
finally
stumbled
back
into
his
dwelling
and
into
bed
all
that
day
he
lay
there
body
on
fire
with
fever
and
heart
pounding
like
a
drum
he
was
almost
certain
he
would
soon
die
it
was
just
as
well
a
little
corner
of
his
consciousness
said
at
least
he
would
be
missing
all
the
frenzied
excitement
of
thor
s
disappearance
along
with
morge
but
it
looked
as
though
he
had
failed
after
all
in
spite
of
removing
the
god
now
he
was
dying
and
the
dam
still
unfinished
the
day
dragged
on
and
on
and
he
didn
t
die
after
waking
up
in
late
afternoon
he
felt
better
he
ate
a
handful
of
nuts
and
figs
washed
down
with
a
little
herb
tea
then
as
night
crept
over
the
sky
he
tottered
down
to
the
village
whatever
had
taken
place
during
the
day
was
done
and
little
groups
of
people
stood
around
fires
resting
and
talking
as
though
it
were
the
old
days
before
the
coming
of
thor
thought
builder
that
was
good
builder
moved
in
closer
to
one
of
the
fires
to
warm
himself
against
the
early
spring
night
someone
recognized
him
it
was
one
of
his
workers
and
he
was
suddenly
made
welcome
once
again
being
given
the
place
of
honor
nearest
the
fire
as
in
the
old
days
when
he
d
first
discovered
the
humans
builder
was
dumbfounded
at
the
sudden
cordiality
in
recent
days
thougor
had
done
such
a
good
job
of
discrediting
he
never
dreamed
of
regaining
his
old
standing
then
he
was
told
what
had
happened
during
the
day
while
he
lay
almost
dying
when
the
god
and
morge
were
discovered
missing
thougor
had
called
the
village
together
explaining
that
thor
had
left
them
taking
morge
as
a
sacrifice
because
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
tribe
s
paltry
blood
offerings
and
worship
therefore
a
great
death
sacrifice
of
young
men
and
women
must
be
undertaken
to
pacify
thor
and
cause
his
return
but
the
people
questioned
thougor
s
order
they
seemed
to
feel
it
was
the
priest
who
had
been
at
fault
not
themselves
after
all
he
was
the
closest
to
thor
was
he
not
therefore
it
was
thougor
not
the
village
that
thor
had
become
angered
at
and
after
holding
quick
council
they
had
driven
thougor
out
into
the
wilderness
telling
him
he
was
not
to
return
unless
thor
was
with
him
old
builder
almost
cried
when
he
heard
this
joyful
news
the
dam
would
be
completed
after
all
he
was
almost
certain
he
decided
to
say
nothing
more
about
religion
thor
or
thougor
maybe
soon
they
would
forget
the
whole
thing
now
he
could
go
back
to
teaching
the
youngsters
and
some
of
the
brighter
oldsters
the
methods
of
writing
in
symbols
instead
of
drawing
pictures
hours
and
days
turned
into
weeks
and
months
as
builder
taught
his
people
what
feeble
knowledge
he
possessed
in
arithmetic
simple
engineering
such
as
the
dam
and
most
of
all
instilling
in
them
the
will
to
want
to
learn
and
investigate
and
question
anything
they
came
in
contact
with
even
the
very
thing
he
was
asking
them
to
do
as
the
weeks
passed
on
and
the
dam
was
completed
he
gradually
gathered
around
him
an
ardent
little
group
of
seeker
after
that
most
elusive
of
all
things
truth
but
builder
knew
that
his
days
were
numbered
now
and
his
work
completed
there
was
still
one
thing
he
had
to
do
and
that
was
permanently
to
do
away
with
thor
by
dropping
the
idol
to
the
bottom
of
the
dam
he
still
hadn
t
examined
the
god
hidden
under
his
sleeping
pile
one
evening
after
returning
from
a
solitary
walk
above
the
dam
he
entered
his
shack
and
lit
a
torch
then
almost
dropped
it
from
shock
his
dwelling
was
a
wreck
the
place
had
been
ransacked
from
top
to
bottom
his
sleeping
pile
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
idol
was
gone
he
turned
and
fled
from
the
room
but
before
he
could
take
a
dozen
steps
towards
the
village
several
shadows
glided
out
from
behind
trees
and
rocks
in
the
moonlight
resolving
themselves
into
men
before
he
could
cry
out
or
struggle
strong
arms
pinned
his
arms
to
his
body
and
someone
clapped
a
dirty
hand
over
his
mouth
he
was
forced
back
into
his
hovel
and
the
door
slammed
shut
standing
in
front
of
him
was
a
very
bedraggled
figure
whom
he
recognized
as
thougor
he
also
recognized
his
three
other
captors
all
were
elderly
reactionaries
of
the
tribe
who
had
disapproved
of
him
from
the
beginning
in
spite
of
his
predicament
builder
felt
a
warm
glow
of
happiness
course
through
him
if
these
were
the
only
cronies
thougor
could
round
up
that
meant
the
rest
of
the
villagers
were
sympathetic
with
his
cause
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
thougor
s
grating
voice
it
took
me
a
little
time
to
piece
things
together
but
once
i
did
it
didn
t
take
me
long
to
come
back
and
find
the
god
where
i
might
have
at
first
suspected
it
would
be
right
here
for
your
sacrilege
you
will
pay
with
every
last
drop
of
blood
you
have
in
your
scrawny
old
body
and
now
whereupon
thougor
disappeared
out
of
the
hovel
somehow
builder
had
known
they
were
going
to
kill
him
before
arousing
the
rest
of
the
tribe
to
the
fact
that
thor
was
back
thougor
was
taking
no
chances
of
his
standing
in
the
way
of
him
or
thor
ever
again
but
builder
didn
t
care
he
had
sown
his
few
seeds
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
well
although
thougor
didn
t
know
it
this
time
he
wouldn
t
have
complete
homage
from
all
the
tribe
there
would
now
be
doubts
and
questionings
and
tests
for
both
thor
and
thougor
in
the
ways
of
truth
and
righteousness
then
thougor
returned
to
the
shack
with
what
builder
thought
must
be
thor
the
hand
over
his
mouth
had
twisted
his
head
back
so
that
he
only
got
a
glimpse
but
he
didn
t
miss
the
long
knife
thougor
pulled
from
beneath
his
tattered
skins
nor
the
large
sacrificial
bowl
one
of
the
others
held
below
his
neck
then
his
head
was
tilted
forward
and
sidewise
and
he
got
his
first
full
look
at
the
god
thor
at
the
sight
his
whole
body
shook
with
smothered
laughter
below
the
two
arms
and
etched
thunderbolt
were
large
block
letters
standing
out
in
bold
relief
automatic
atomic
powered
