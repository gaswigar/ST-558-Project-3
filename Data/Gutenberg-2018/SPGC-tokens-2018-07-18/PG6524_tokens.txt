stray
birds
of
summer
come
to
my
window
to
sing
and
fly
away
and
yellow
leaves
of
autumn
which
have
no
songs
flutter
and
fall
there
with
a
sigh
o
troupe
of
little
vagrants
of
the
world
leave
your
footprints
in
my
words
the
world
puts
off
its
mask
of
vastness
to
its
lover
it
becomes
small
as
one
song
as
one
kiss
of
the
eternal
it
is
the
tears
of
the
earth
that
keep
her
smiles
in
bloom
the
mighty
desert
is
burning
for
the
love
of
a
blade
of
grass
who
shakes
her
head
and
laughs
and
flies
away
if
you
shed
tears
when
you
miss
the
sun
you
also
miss
the
stars
the
sands
in
your
way
beg
for
your
song
and
your
movement
dancing
water
will
you
carry
the
burden
of
their
lameness
her
wistful
face
haunts
my
dreams
like
the
rain
at
night
once
we
dreamt
that
we
were
strangers
we
wake
up
to
find
that
we
were
dear
to
each
other
sorrow
is
hushed
into
peace
in
my
heart
like
the
evening
among
the
silent
trees
some
unseen
fingers
like
idle
breeze
are
playing
upon
my
heart
the
music
of
the
ripples
what
language
is
thine
o
sea
the
language
of
eternal
question
what
language
is
thy
answer
o
sky
the
language
of
eternal
silence
listen
my
heart
to
the
whispers
of
the
world
with
which
it
makes
love
to
you
the
mystery
of
creation
is
like
the
darkness
of
night
it
is
great
delusions
of
knowledge
are
like
the
fog
of
the
morning
do
not
seat
your
love
upon
a
precipice
because
it
is
high
i
sit
at
my
window
this
morning
where
the
world
like
a
stops
for
a
moment
nods
to
me
and
goes
these
little
thoughts
are
the
rustle
of
leaves
they
have
their
whisper
of
joy
in
my
mind
what
you
are
you
do
not
see
what
you
see
is
your
shadow
my
wishes
are
fools
they
shout
across
thy
songs
my
master
let
me
but
listen
i
can
not
choose
the
best
the
best
chooses
me
they
throw
their
shadows
before
them
who
carry
their
lantern
on
their
back
that
i
exist
is
a
perpetual
surprise
which
is
life
we
the
rustling
leaves
have
a
voice
that
answers
the
storms
but
who
are
you
so
silent
i
am
a
mere
flower
rest
belongs
to
the
work
as
the
eyelids
to
the
eyes
man
is
a
born
child
his
power
is
the
power
of
growth
god
expects
answers
for
the
flowers
he
sends
us
not
for
the
sun
and
the
earth
the
light
that
plays
like
a
naked
child
among
the
green
leaves
happily
knows
not
that
man
can
lie
o
beauty
find
thyself
in
love
not
in
the
flattery
of
thy
mirror
my
heart
beats
her
waves
at
the
shore
of
the
world
and
writes
upon
it
her
signature
in
tears
with
the
words
i
love
thee
moon
for
what
do
you
wait
to
salute
the
sun
for
whom
i
must
make
way
the
trees
come
up
to
my
window
like
the
yearning
voice
of
the
dumb
earth
his
own
mornings
are
new
surprises
to
god
life
finds
its
wealth
by
the
claims
of
the
world
and
its
worth
by
the
claims
of
love
the
dry
finds
no
thanks
for
its
past
the
bird
wishes
it
were
a
cloud
the
cloud
wishes
it
were
a
bird
the
waterfall
sings
i
find
my
song
when
i
find
my
freedom
i
can
not
tell
why
this
heart
languishes
in
silence
it
is
for
small
needs
it
never
asks
or
knows
or
remembers
woman
when
you
move
about
in
your
household
service
your
limbs
sing
like
a
hill
stream
among
its
pebbles
the
sun
goes
to
cross
the
western
sea
leaving
its
last
salutation
to
the
east
do
not
blame
your
food
because
you
have
no
appetite
the
trees
like
the
longings
of
the
earth
stand
to
peep
at
the
heaven
you
smiled
and
talked
to
me
of
nothing
and
i
felt
that
for
this
i
had
been
waiting
long
the
fish
in
the
water
is
silent
the
animal
on
the
earth
is
noisy
the
bird
in
the
air
is
singing
but
man
has
in
him
the
silence
of
the
sea
the
noise
of
the
earth
and
the
music
of
the
air
the
world
rushes
on
over
the
strings
of
the
lingering
heart
making
the
music
of
sadness
he
has
made
his
weapons
his
gods
when
his
weapons
win
he
is
defeated
himself
god
finds
himself
by
creating
shadow
with
her
veil
drawn
follows
light
in
secret
meekness
with
her
silent
steps
of
love
the
stars
are
not
afraid
to
appear
like
fireflies
i
thank
thee
that
i
am
none
of
the
wheels
of
power
but
i
am
one
with
the
living
creatures
that
are
crushed
by
it
the
mind
sharp
but
not
broad
sticks
at
every
point
but
does
not
move
your
idol
is
shattered
in
the
dust
to
prove
that
god
dust
is
greater
than
your
idol
man
does
not
reveal
himself
in
his
history
he
struggles
up
through
it
while
the
glass
lamp
rebukes
the
earthen
for
calling
it
cousin
the
moon
rises
and
the
glass
lamp
with
a
bland
smile
calls
her
my
dear
dear
sister
like
the
meeting
of
the
seagulls
and
the
waves
we
meet
and
come
near
the
seagulls
fly
off
the
waves
roll
away
and
we
depart
my
day
is
done
and
i
am
like
a
boat
drawn
on
the
beach
listening
to
the
of
the
tide
in
the
evening
life
is
given
to
us
we
earn
it
by
giving
it
we
come
nearest
to
the
great
when
we
are
great
in
humility
the
sparrow
is
sorry
for
the
peacock
at
the
burden
of
its
tail
never
be
afraid
of
the
moments
thus
sings
the
voice
of
the
everlasting
the
hurricane
seeks
the
shortest
road
by
the
and
suddenly
ends
its
search
in
the
nowhere
take
my
wine
in
my
own
cup
friend
it
loses
its
wreath
of
foam
when
poured
into
that
of
others
the
perfect
decks
itself
in
beauty
for
the
love
of
the
imperfect
god
says
to
man
i
heal
you
therefore
i
hurt
love
you
therefore
punish
thank
the
flame
for
its
light
but
do
not
forget
the
lampholder
standing
in
the
shade
with
constancy
of
patience
tiny
grass
your
steps
are
small
but
you
possess
the
earth
under
your
tread
the
infant
flower
opens
its
bud
and
cries
dear
world
please
do
not
fade
god
grows
weary
of
great
kingdoms
but
never
of
little
flowers
wrong
can
not
afford
defeat
but
right
can
i
give
my
whole
water
in
joy
sings
the
waterfall
though
little
of
it
is
enough
for
the
thirsty
where
is
the
fountain
that
throws
up
these
flowers
in
a
ceaseless
outbreak
of
ecstasy
the
woodcutter
axe
begged
for
its
handle
from
the
tree
the
tree
gave
it
in
my
solitude
of
heart
i
feel
the
sigh
of
this
widowed
evening
veiled
with
mist
and
rain
chastity
is
a
wealth
that
comes
from
abundance
of
love
the
mist
like
love
plays
upon
the
heart
of
the
hills
and
brings
out
surprises
of
beauty
we
read
the
world
wrong
and
say
that
it
deceives
us
the
poet
wind
is
out
over
the
sea
and
the
forest
to
seek
his
own
voice
every
child
comes
with
the
message
that
god
is
not
yet
discouraged
of
man
the
grass
seeks
her
crowd
in
the
earth
the
tree
seeks
his
solitude
of
the
sky
man
barricades
against
himself
your
voice
my
friend
wanders
in
my
heart
like
the
muffled
sound
of
the
sea
among
these
listening
pines
what
is
this
unseen
flame
of
darkness
whose
sparks
are
the
stars
let
life
be
beautiful
like
summer
flowers
and
death
like
autumn
leaves
he
who
wants
to
do
good
knocks
at
the
gate
he
who
loves
finds
the
gate
open
in
death
the
many
becomes
one
in
life
the
one
becomes
many
religion
will
be
one
when
god
is
dead
the
artist
is
the
lover
of
nature
therefore
he
is
her
slave
and
her
master
how
far
are
you
from
me
o
fruit
i
am
hidden
in
your
heart
o
flower
this
longing
is
for
the
one
who
is
felt
in
the
dark
but
not
seen
in
the
day
you
are
the
big
drop
of
dew
under
the
lotus
leaf
i
am
the
smaller
one
on
its
upper
side
said
the
dewdrop
to
the
lake
the
scabbard
is
content
to
be
dull
when
it
protects
the
keenness
of
the
sword
in
darkness
the
one
appears
as
uniform
in
the
light
the
one
appears
as
manifold
the
great
earth
makes
herself
hospitable
with
the
help
of
the
grass
the
birth
and
death
of
the
leaves
are
the
rapid
whirls
of
the
eddy
whose
wider
circles
move
slowly
among
stars
power
said
to
the
world
you
are
mine
the
world
kept
it
prisoner
on
her
throne
love
said
to
the
world
i
am
thine
the
world
gave
it
the
freedom
of
her
house
the
mist
is
like
the
earth
desire
it
hides
the
sun
for
whom
she
cries
be
still
my
heart
these
great
trees
are
prayers
the
noise
of
the
moment
scoffs
at
the
music
of
the
eternal
i
think
of
other
ages
that
floated
upon
the
stream
of
life
and
love
and
death
and
are
forgotten
and
i
feel
the
freedom
of
passing
away
the
sadness
of
my
soul
is
her
bride
veil
it
waits
to
be
lifted
in
the
night
death
stamp
gives
value
to
the
coin
of
life
making
it
possible
to
buy
with
life
what
is
truly
precious
the
cloud
stood
humbly
in
a
corner
of
the
sky
the
morning
crowned
it
with
splendour
the
dust
receives
insult
and
in
return
offers
her
flowers
do
not
linger
to
gather
flowers
to
keep
them
but
walk
on
for
flowers
will
keep
themselves
blooming
all
your
way
roots
are
the
branches
down
in
the
earth
branches
are
roots
in
the
air
the
music
of
the
summer
flutters
around
the
autumn
seeking
its
former
nest
do
not
insult
your
friend
by
lending
him
merits
from
your
own
pocket
the
touch
of
the
nameless
days
clings
to
my
heart
like
mosses
round
the
old
tree
the
echo
mocks
her
origin
to
prove
she
is
the
original
god
is
ashamed
when
the
prosperous
boasts
of
his
special
favour
i
cast
my
own
shadow
upon
my
path
because
i
have
a
lamp
that
has
not
been
lighted
man
goes
into
the
noisy
crowd
to
drown
his
own
clamour
of
silence
that
which
ends
in
exhaustion
is
death
but
the
perfect
ending
is
in
the
endless
the
sun
has
his
simple
robe
of
light
the
clouds
are
decked
with
gorgeousness
the
hills
are
like
shouts
of
children
who
raise
their
arms
trying
to
catch
stars
the
road
is
lonely
in
its
crowd
for
it
is
not
loved
the
power
that
boasts
of
its
mischiefs
is
laughed
at
by
the
yellow
leaves
that
fall
and
clouds
that
pass
by
the
earth
hums
to
me
in
the
sun
like
a
woman
at
her
spinng
some
ballad
of
the
ancient
time
in
a
forgotten
tongue
the
is
worth
of
the
great
world
where
it
grows
dream
is
a
wife
who
must
talk
sleep
is
a
husband
who
silently
suffers
the
night
kisses
the
fading
day
whispering
to
his
ear
i
am
death
your
mother
i
am
to
give
you
fresh
birth
i
feel
thy
beauty
dark
night
like
that
of
the
loved
woman
when
she
has
put
out
the
lamp
i
carry
in
my
world
that
flourishes
the
worlds
that
have
failed
dear
friend
i
feel
the
silence
of
your
great
thoughts
of
may
a
deepening
eventide
on
this
beach
when
i
listen
to
these
waves
the
bird
thinks
it
is
an
act
of
kindness
to
give
the
fish
a
lift
in
the
air
in
the
moon
thou
sendest
thy
love
letters
to
me
said
the
night
to
the
sun
i
leave
my
answers
in
tears
upon
the
grass
the
great
is
a
born
child
when
he
dies
he
gives
his
great
childhood
to
the
world
not
hammerstrokes
but
dance
of
the
water
sings
the
pebbles
into
perfection
bees
sip
honey
from
flowers
and
hum
their
thanks
when
they
leave
the
gaudy
butterfly
is
sure
that
the
flowers
owe
thanks
to
him
to
be
outspoken
is
easy
when
you
do
not
wait
to
speak
the
complete
truth
asks
the
possible
to
the
impossible
where
is
your
dwelling
place
in
the
dreams
of
the
impotent
comes
the
answer
if
you
shut
your
door
to
all
errors
truth
will
be
shut
out
i
hear
some
rustle
of
things
behind
my
sadness
of
heart
i
can
not
see
them
leisure
in
its
activity
is
work
the
stillness
of
the
sea
stirs
in
waves
the
leaf
becomes
flower
when
it
loves
the
flower
becomes
fruit
when
it
worships
the
roots
below
the
earth
claim
no
rewards
for
making
the
branches
fruitful
this
rainy
evening
the
wind
is
restless
i
look
at
the
swaying
branches
and
ponder
over
the
greatness
of
all
things
storm
of
midnight
like
a
giant
child
awakened
in
the
untimely
dark
has
begun
to
play
and
shout
thou
raisest
thy
waves
vainly
to
follow
thy
lover
o
sea
thou
lonely
bride
of
the
storm
i
am
ashamed
of
my
emptiness
said
the
word
to
the
work
i
know
how
poor
i
am
when
i
see
you
said
the
work
to
the
word
time
is
the
wealth
of
change
but
the
clock
in
its
parody
makes
it
mere
change
and
no
wealth
truth
in
her
dress
finds
facts
too
tight
in
fiction
she
moves
with
ease
when
i
travelled
to
here
and
to
there
i
was
tired
of
thee
o
road
but
now
when
thou
leadest
me
to
everywhere
i
am
wedded
to
thee
in
love
let
me
think
that
there
is
one
among
those
stars
that
guides
my
life
through
the
dark
unknown
woman
with
the
grace
of
your
fingers
you
touched
my
things
and
order
came
out
like
music
one
sad
voice
has
its
nest
among
the
ruins
of
the
years
it
sings
to
me
in
the
night
i
loved
you
the
flaming
fire
warns
me
off
by
its
own
glow
save
me
from
the
dying
embers
hidden
under
ashes
i
have
my
stars
in
the
sky
but
oh
for
my
little
lamp
unlit
in
my
house
the
dust
of
the
dead
words
clings
to
thee
wash
thy
soul
with
silence
gaps
are
left
in
life
through
which
comes
the
sad
music
of
death
the
world
has
opened
its
heart
of
light
in
the
morning
come
out
my
heart
with
thy
love
to
meet
it
my
thoughts
shimmer
with
these
shimmering
leaves
and
my
heart
sings
with
the
touch
of
this
sunlight
my
life
is
glad
to
be
floating
with
all
things
into
the
blue
of
space
into
the
dark
of
time
god
great
power
is
in
the
gentle
breeze
not
in
the
storm
this
is
a
dream
in
which
things
are
all
loose
and
they
oppress
i
shall
find
them
gathered
in
thee
when
i
awake
and
shall
be
free
who
is
there
to
take
up
my
duties
asked
the
setting
sun
i
shall
do
what
i
can
my
master
said
the
earthen
lamp
by
plucking
her
petals
you
do
not
gather
the
beauty
of
the
flower
silence
will
carry
your
voice
like
the
nest
that
holds
the
sleeping
birds
the
great
walks
with
the
small
without
fear
the
middling
keeps
aloof
the
night
opens
the
flowers
in
secret
and
allows
the
day
to
get
thanks
power
takes
as
ingratitude
the
writhings
of
its
victims
when
we
rejoice
in
our
fulness
then
we
can
part
with
our
fruits
with
joy
the
raindrops
kissed
the
earth
and
whispered
we
are
thy
homesick
children
mother
come
back
to
thee
from
the
heaven
the
cobweb
pretends
to
catch
and
catches
flies
love
when
you
come
with
the
burning
lamp
of
pain
in
your
hand
i
can
see
your
face
and
know
you
as
bliss
the
learned
say
that
your
lights
will
one
day
be
no
more
said
the
firefly
to
the
stars
the
stars
made
no
answer
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
the
bird
of
some
early
dawn
comes
to
the
nest
of
my
silence
thoughts
pass
in
my
mind
like
flocks
of
ducks
in
the
sky
i
hear
the
voice
of
their
wings
the
canal
loves
to
think
that
rivers
exist
solely
to
supply
it
with
water
the
world
has
kissed
my
soul
with
its
pain
asking
for
its
return
in
songs
that
which
oppresses
me
is
it
my
soul
trying
to
come
out
in
the
open
or
the
soul
of
the
world
knocking
at
my
heart
for
its
entrance
thought
feeds
itself
with
its
own
words
and
grows
i
have
dipped
the
vessel
of
my
heart
into
this
silent
hour
it
has
filled
with
love
either
you
have
work
or
you
have
not
when
you
have
to
say
let
us
do
something
then
begins
mischief
the
sunflower
blushed
to
own
the
nameless
flower
as
her
kin
the
sun
rose
and
smiled
on
it
saying
are
you
well
my
darling
who
drives
me
forward
like
fate
the
myself
striding
on
my
back
the
clouds
fill
the
watercups
of
the
river
hiding
themselves
in
the
distant
hills
i
spill
water
from
my
water
jar
as
i
walk
on
my
way
very
little
remains
for
my
home
the
water
in
a
vessel
is
sparkling
the
water
in
the
sea
is
dark
the
small
truth
has
words
that
are
clear
the
great
truth
has
great
silence
your
smile
was
the
flowers
of
your
own
fields
your
talk
was
the
rustle
of
your
own
mountain
pines
but
your
heart
was
the
woman
that
we
all
know
it
is
the
little
things
that
i
leave
behind
for
my
loved
ones
great
things
are
for
everyone
woman
thou
hast
encircled
the
world
heart
with
the
depth
of
thy
tears
as
the
sea
has
the
earth
the
sunshine
greets
me
with
a
smile
the
rain
his
sad
sister
talks
to
my
heart
my
flower
of
the
day
dropped
its
petals
forgotten
in
the
evening
it
ripens
into
a
golden
fruit
of
memory
i
am
like
the
road
in
the
night
listening
to
the
footfalls
of
its
memories
in
silence
the
evening
sky
to
me
is
like
a
window
and
a
lighted
lamp
and
a
waiting
behind
it
he
who
is
too
busy
doing
good
finds
no
time
to
be
good
i
am
the
autumn
cloud
empty
of
rain
see
my
fulness
in
the
field
of
ripened
rice
they
hated
and
killed
and
men
praised
them
but
god
in
shame
hastens
to
hide
its
memory
under
the
green
grass
toes
are
the
fingers
that
have
forsaken
their
past
darkness
travels
towards
light
but
blindness
towards
death
the
pet
dog
suspects
the
universe
for
scheming
to
take
its
place
sit
still
my
heart
do
not
raise
your
dust
let
the
world
find
its
way
to
you
the
bow
whispers
to
the
arrow
before
it
speeds
forth
your
freedom
is
mine
woman
in
your
laughter
you
have
the
music
of
the
fountain
of
life
a
mind
all
logic
is
like
a
knife
all
blade
it
makes
the
hand
bleed
that
uses
it
god
loves
man
lamp
lights
better
than
his
own
great
stars
this
world
is
the
world
of
wild
storms
kept
tame
with
the
music
of
beauty
my
heart
is
like
the
golden
casket
of
thy
kiss
said
the
sunset
cloud
to
the
sun
by
touching
you
may
kill
by
keeping
away
you
may
possess
the
cricket
chirp
and
the
patter
of
rain
come
to
me
through
the
dark
like
the
rustle
of
dreams
from
my
past
youth
i
have
lost
my
dewdrop
cries
the
flower
to
the
morning
sky
that
has
lost
all
its
stars
the
burning
log
bursts
in
flame
and
cries
this
is
my
flower
my
death
the
wasp
thinks
that
the
of
the
neighbouring
bees
is
too
small
his
neighbours
ask
him
to
build
one
still
smaller
i
can
not
keep
your
waves
says
the
bank
to
the
river
let
me
keep
your
footprints
in
my
heart
the
day
with
the
noise
of
this
little
earth
drowns
the
silence
of
all
worlds
the
song
feels
the
infinite
in
the
air
the
picture
in
the
earth
the
poem
in
the
air
and
the
earth
for
its
words
have
meaning
that
walks
and
music
that
soars
when
the
sun
goes
down
to
the
west
the
east
of
his
morning
stands
before
him
in
silence
let
me
not
put
myself
wrongly
to
my
world
and
set
it
against
me
praise
shames
me
for
i
secretly
beg
for
it
let
my
doing
nothing
when
i
have
nothing
to
do
become
untroubled
in
its
depth
of
peace
like
the
evening
in
the
seashore
when
the
water
is
silent
maiden
your
simplicity
like
the
blueness
of
the
lake
reveals
your
depth
of
truth
the
best
does
not
come
alone
it
comes
with
the
company
of
the
all
god
right
hand
is
gentle
but
terrible
is
his
left
hand
my
evening
came
among
the
alien
trees
and
spoke
in
a
language
which
my
morning
stars
did
not
know
night
darkness
is
a
bag
that
bursts
with
the
gold
of
the
dawn
our
desire
lends
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
to
the
mere
mists
and
vapours
of
life
god
waits
to
win
back
his
own
flowers
as
gifts
from
man
hands
my
sad
thoughts
tease
me
asking
me
their
own
names
the
service
of
the
fruit
is
precious
the
service
of
the
flower
is
sweet
but
let
my
service
be
the
service
of
the
leaves
in
its
shade
of
humble
devotion
my
heart
has
spread
its
sails
to
the
idle
winds
for
the
shadowy
island
of
anywhere
men
are
cruel
but
man
is
kind
make
me
thy
cup
and
let
my
fulness
be
for
thee
and
for
thine
the
storm
is
like
the
cry
of
some
god
in
pain
whose
love
the
earth
refuses
the
world
does
not
leak
because
death
is
not
a
crack
life
has
become
richer
by
the
love
that
has
been
lost
my
friend
your
great
heart
shone
with
the
sunrise
of
the
east
like
the
snowy
summit
of
a
lonely
hill
in
the
dawn
the
fountain
of
death
makes
the
still
water
of
life
play
those
who
have
everything
but
thee
my
god
laugh
at
those
who
have
nothing
but
thyself
the
movement
of
life
has
its
rest
in
its
own
music
kicks
only
raise
dust
and
not
crops
from
the
earth
our
names
are
the
light
that
glows
on
the
sea
waves
at
night
and
then
dies
without
leaving
its
signature
let
him
only
see
the
thorns
who
has
eyes
to
see
the
rose
set
bird
wings
with
gold
and
it
will
never
again
soar
in
the
sky
the
same
lotus
of
our
clime
blooms
here
in
the
alien
water
with
the
same
sweetness
under
another
name
in
heart
perspective
the
distance
looms
large
the
moon
has
her
light
all
over
the
sky
her
dark
spots
to
herself
do
not
say
it
is
morning
and
dismiss
it
with
a
name
of
yesterday
see
it
for
the
first
time
as
a
child
that
has
no
name
smoke
boasts
to
the
sky
and
ashes
to
the
earth
that
they
are
brothers
to
the
fire
the
raindrop
whispered
to
the
jasmine
keep
me
in
your
heart
for
ever
the
jasmine
sighed
alas
and
dropped
to
the
ground
timid
thoughts
do
not
be
afraid
of
me
i
am
a
poet
the
dim
silence
of
my
mind
seems
filled
with
crickets
chirp
the
grey
twilight
of
sound
rockets
your
insult
to
the
stars
follows
yourself
back
to
the
earth
thou
hast
led
me
through
my
crowded
travels
of
the
day
to
my
evening
loneliness
i
wait
for
its
meaning
through
the
stillness
of
the
night
this
life
is
the
crossing
of
a
sea
where
we
meet
in
the
same
narrow
ship
in
death
we
reach
the
shore
and
go
to
our
different
worlds
the
stream
of
truth
flows
through
its
channels
of
mistakes
my
heart
is
homesick
for
the
one
sweet
hour
across
the
sea
of
time
the
is
the
echo
of
the
morning
light
back
from
the
earth
are
you
too
proud
to
kiss
me
the
morning
light
asks
the
buttercup
how
may
i
sing
to
thee
and
worship
o
sun
asked
the
little
flower
by
the
simple
silence
of
thy
purity
answered
the
sun
man
is
worse
than
an
animal
when
he
is
an
animal
dark
clouds
become
heaven
flowers
when
kissed
by
light
let
not
the
mock
its
handle
for
being
blunt
the
night
silence
like
a
deep
lamp
is
burning
with
the
light
of
its
milky
way
around
the
sunny
island
of
life
swells
day
and
night
limitless
song
of
the
sea
is
not
this
mountain
like
a
flower
with
its
petals
of
hills
drinking
the
sunlight
the
real
with
its
meaning
read
wrong
and
emphasis
misplaced
is
the
unreal
find
your
beauty
my
heart
from
the
world
movement
like
the
boat
that
has
the
grace
of
the
wind
and
the
water
the
eyes
are
not
proud
of
their
sight
but
of
their
eyeglasses
i
live
in
this
little
world
of
mine
and
am
afraid
to
make
it
the
least
less
lift
me
into
thy
world
and
let
me
have
the
freedom
gladly
to
lose
my
all
the
false
can
never
grow
into
truth
by
growing
in
power
my
heart
with
its
lapping
waves
of
song
longs
to
caress
this
green
world
of
the
sunny
day
wayside
grass
love
the
star
then
your
dreams
will
come
out
in
flowers
let
your
music
like
a
sword
pierce
the
noise
of
the
market
to
its
heart
the
trembling
leaves
of
this
tree
touch
my
heart
like
the
fingers
of
an
infant
child
this
sadness
of
my
soul
is
her
bride
veil
it
waits
to
be
lifted
in
the
night
the
little
flower
lies
in
the
dust
it
sought
the
path
of
the
butterfly
i
am
in
the
world
of
the
roads
the
night
comes
open
thy
gate
thou
world
of
the
home
i
have
sung
the
songs
of
thy
day
in
the
evening
let
me
carry
thy
lamp
through
the
stormy
path
i
do
not
ask
thee
into
the
house
come
into
my
infinite
loneliness
my
lover
death
belongs
to
life
as
birth
does
the
walk
is
in
the
raising
of
the
foot
as
in
the
laying
of
it
down
i
have
learnt
the
simple
meaning
of
thy
whispers
in
flowers
and
sunshine
teach
me
to
know
thy
words
in
pain
and
death
the
night
flower
was
late
when
the
morning
kissed
her
she
shivered
and
sighed
and
dropped
to
the
ground
through
the
sadness
of
all
things
i
hear
the
crooning
of
the
eternal
mother
i
came
to
your
shore
as
a
stranger
i
lived
in
your
house
as
a
guest
i
leave
your
door
as
a
friend
my
earth
let
my
thoughts
come
to
you
when
i
am
gone
like
the
afterglow
of
sunset
at
the
margin
of
starry
silence
light
in
my
heart
the
evening
star
of
rest
and
then
let
the
night
whisper
to
me
of
love
i
am
a
child
in
the
dark
i
stretch
my
hands
through
the
coverlet
of
night
for
thee
mother
the
day
of
work
is
done
hide
my
face
in
your
arms
mother
let
me
dream
the
lamp
of
meeting
burns
long
it
goes
out
in
a
moment
at
the
parting
one
word
keep
for
me
in
thy
silence
o
world
when
i
am
dead
i
have
loved
we
live
in
this
world
when
we
love
it
let
the
dead
have
the
immortality
of
fame
but
the
living
the
immortality
of
love
i
have
seen
thee
as
the
child
sees
his
mother
in
the
dusk
of
the
dawn
and
then
smiles
and
sleeps
again
i
shall
die
again
and
again
to
know
that
life
is
inexhaustible
while
i
was
passing
with
the
crowd
in
the
road
i
saw
thy
smile
from
the
balcony
and
i
sang
and
forgot
all
noise
love
is
life
in
its
fulness
like
the
cup
with
its
wine
they
light
their
own
lamps
and
sing
their
own
words
in
their
temples
but
the
birds
sing
thy
name
in
thine
own
morning
light
for
thy
name
is
joy
lead
me
in
the
centre
of
thy
silence
to
fill
my
heart
with
songs
let
them
live
who
choose
in
their
own
hissing
world
of
fireworks
my
heart
longs
for
thy
stars
my
god
love
pain
sang
round
my
life
like
the
unplumbed
sea
and
joy
sang
like
birds
in
its
flowering
groves
put
out
the
lamp
when
thou
wishest
i
shall
know
thy
darkness
and
shall
love
it
when
i
stand
before
thee
at
the
day
end
thou
shalt
see
my
scars
and
know
that
i
had
my
wounds
and
also
my
healing
some
day
i
shall
sing
to
thee
in
the
sunrise
of
some
other
world
i
have
seen
thee
before
in
the
light
of
the
earth
in
the
love
of
man
clouds
come
floating
into
my
life
from
other
days
no
longer
to
shed
rain
or
usher
storm
but
to
give
colour
to
my
sunset
sky
truth
raises
against
itself
the
storm
that
scatters
its
seeds
broadcast
the
storm
of
the
last
night
has
crowned
this
morning
with
golden
peace
truth
seems
to
come
with
its
final
word
and
the
final
word
gives
birth
to
its
next
blessed
is
he
whose
fame
does
not
outshine
his
truth
sweetness
of
thy
name
fills
my
heart
when
i
forget
mine
like
thy
morning
sun
when
the
mist
is
melted
the
silent
night
has
the
beauty
of
the
mother
and
the
clamorous
day
of
the
child
the
world
loved
man
when
he
smiled
the
world
became
afraid
of
him
when
he
laughed
god
waits
for
man
to
regain
his
childhood
in
wisdom
let
me
feel
this
world
as
thy
love
taking
form
then
my
love
will
help
it
thy
sunshine
smiles
upon
the
winter
days
of
my
heart
never
doubting
of
its
spring
flowers
god
kisses
the
finite
in
his
love
and
man
the
infinite
thou
crossest
desert
lands
of
barren
years
to
reach
the
moment
of
fulfilment
god
silence
ripens
man
thoughts
into
speech
thou
wilt
find
eternal
traveller
marks
of
thy
footsteps
across
my
songs
let
me
not
shame
thee
father
who
displayest
thy
glory
in
thy
children
cheerless
is
the
day
the
light
under
frowning
clouds
is
like
a
punished
child
with
traces
of
tears
on
its
pale
cheeks
and
the
cry
of
the
wind
is
like
the
cry
of
a
wounded
world
but
i
know
i
am
travelling
to
meet
my
friend
there
is
a
stir
among
the
palm
leaves
a
swell
in
the
sea
full
moon
like
the
heart
throb
of
the
world
from
what
unknown
sky
hast
thou
carried
in
thy
silence
the
aching
secret
of
love
i
dream
of
a
star
an
island
of
light
where
i
shall
be
born
and
in
the
depth
of
its
quickening
leisure
my
life
will
ripen
its
works
like
the
ricefield
in
the
autumn
sun
the
smell
of
the
wet
earth
in
the
rain
rises
like
a
great
chant
of
praise
from
the
voiceless
multitude
of
the
insignificant
that
love
can
ever
lose
is
a
fact
that
we
can
not
accept
as
truth
we
shall
know
some
day
that
death
can
never
rob
us
of
that
which
our
soul
has
gained
for
her
gains
are
one
with
herself
god
comes
to
me
in
the
dusk
of
my
evening
with
the
flowers
from
my
past
kept
fresh
in
his
basket
when
all
the
strings
of
my
life
will
be
tuned
my
master
then
at
every
touch
of
thine
will
come
out
the
music
of
love
let
me
live
truly
my
lord
so
that
death
to
me
become
true
man
history
is
waiting
in
patience
for
the
triumph
of
the
insulted
man
i
feel
thy
gaze
upon
my
heart
this
moment
like
the
sunny
silence
of
the
morning
upon
the
lonely
field
whose
harvest
is
over
i
long
for
the
island
of
songs
across
this
heaving
sea
of
shouts
the
prelude
of
the
night
is
commenced
in
the
music
of
the
sunset
in
its
solemn
hymn
to
the
ineffable
dark
i
have
scaled
the
peak
and
found
no
shelter
in
fame
bleak
and
barren
height
lead
me
my
guide
before
the
light
fades
into
the
valley
of
quiet
where
life
harvest
mellows
into
golden
wisdom
things
look
phantastic
in
this
dimness
of
the
dusk
the
spires
whose
bases
are
lost
in
the
dark
and
tree
tops
like
blots
of
ink
i
shall
wait
for
the
morning
and
wake
up
to
see
thy
city
in
the
light
i
have
suffered
and
despaired
and
known
death
and
i
am
glad
that
i
am
in
this
great
world
there
are
tracts
in
my
life
that
are
bare
and
silent
they
are
the
open
spaces
where
my
busy
days
had
their
light
and
air
release
me
from
my
unfulfilled
past
clinging
to
me
from
behind
making
death
difficult
let
this
be
my
last
word
that
i
trust
in
thy
love
