was
the
son
of

given
up
his
office
of

two
years

his
third
son
and
obtained
some
years
afterwards
a
treasurer
office
in
the
chambre
des
comptes
voltaire
was
born
in
the
year
he
lived
until
within
ten
or
eleven
years
of
the
outbreak
of
the
great
french
revolution
and
was
a
chief
leader
in
the
movement
of
thought
that
preceded
the
revolution
though
he
lived
to
his
year
voltaire
was
born
with
a
weak
body
his
brother
armand
eight
years
his
senior
became
a
jansenist
voltaire
when
ten
years
old
was
placed
with
the
jesuits
in
the
college
grand
there
he
was
taught
during
seven
years
and
his
genius
was
encouraged
in
its
bent
for
literature
skill
in
speaking
and
in
writing
being
especially
fostered
in
the
system
of
education
which
the
jesuits
had
planned
to
produce
capable
men
who
by
voice
and
pen
could
give
a
reason
for
the
faith
they
held
verses
written
for
an
invalid
soldier
at
the
age
of
eleven
won
for
young
voltaire
the
friendship
of
ninon
who
encouraged
him
to
go
on
writing
verses
she
died
soon
afterwards
and
remembered
him
with
a
legacy
of
two
thousand
livres
for
purchase
of
books
he
wrote
in
his
lively
a
tragedy
that
afterwards
he
burnt
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
left
the
college
where
he
said
afterwards
that
he
had
been
taught
nothing
but
latin
and
the
stupidities
he
was
then
sent
to
the
law
schools
and
saw
life
in
paris
as
a
gay
young
poet
who
with
all
his
brilliant
liveliness
had
an
aptitude
for
looking
on
the
tragic
side
of
things
and
one
of
whose
first
poems
was
an
ode
on
the
misfortunes
of
life
his
mother
died
when
he
was
twenty
voltaire
father
thought
him
a
fool
for
his
versifying
and
attached
him
as
secretary
to
the
marquis
of
chateauneuf
when
he
went
as
ambassador
to
the
hague
in
december
he
was
dismissed
for
his
irregularities
in
paris
his
unsteadiness
and
his
addiction
to
literature
caused
his
father
to
rejoice
in
getting
him
housed
in
a
country
chateau
with
de
caumartin
de
father
talked
with
such
enthusiasm
of
henri
iv
and
sully
that
voltaire
planned
the
writing
of
what
became
his
and
his
history
of
the
age
of
louis
who
died
on
the
of
september
under
the
regency
that
followed
voltaire
got
into
trouble
again
and
again
through
the
sharpness
of
his
pen
and
at
last
accused
of
verse
that
satirised
the
regent
he
was
locked
up
on
the
of
may
in
the
bastille
there
he
wrote
the
first
two
books
of
his
and
finished
a
play
on
oedipus
which
he
had
begun
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
did
not
obtain
full
liberty
until
the
of
april
and
it
was
at
this
time
with
a
clearly
formed
design
to
associate
the
name
he
took
with
work
of
high
attempt
in
literature
that
francois
marie
arouet
aged
first
called
himself
voltaire
voltaire
was
played
with
success
in
november
a
few
months
later
he
was

well
as

was
then
in
receipt
of
a
pension

two
thousand
livres
from
the
king
and
had
inherited
more
than
twice
as
much
by
the
death
of
his
father
in
january
but
in
december
a
quarrel
fastened
upon
him
by
the
chevalier
de
rohan
who
had
him
waylaid
and
beaten

him
to
send
a
challenge
for
this
he
was
arrested
and
lodged
once
more
in
april
in
the
bastille
there
he
was
detained
a
month
and
his
first
act
when

was
to
ask
for
a
passport
to
england
voltaire
left
france
reached
london
in
august
went
as
guest
to
the
house
of
a
rich
merchant
at
wandsworth
and
remained
three
years
in
this
country
from
the
age
of
to
the
age
of
he
was
here
when
george
died
and
george
ii
became
king
he
published
here
his
he
wrote
here
his
history
of
charles
xii
he
read
gulliver
travels
as
a
new
book
and
might
have
been
present
at
the
first
night
of
beggar
he
was
here
whet
sir
isaac
newton
died
in
he
published
at
rouen
the
sur
les
which
appeared
in
england
in
in
the
volume
from
which
they
are
here
reprinted
letters
on
england
letter
on
the
quakers
i
was
of
opinion
that
the
doctrine
and
history
of
so
extraordinary
a
people
were
worthy
the
attention
of
the
curious
to
acquaint
myself
with
them
i
made
a
visit
to
one
of
the
most
eminent
quakers
in
england
who
after
having
traded
thirty
years
had
the
wisdom
to
prescribe
limits
to
his
fortune
and
to
his
desires
and
was
settled
in
a
little
solitude
not
far
from
london
being
come
into
it
i
perceived
a
small
but
regularly
built
house
vastly
neat
but
without
the
least
pomp
of
furniture
the
quaker
who
owned
it
was
a
hale
old
man
who
had
never
been
afflicted
with
sickness
because
he
had
always
been
insensible
to
passions
and
a
perfect
stranger
to
intemperance
i
never
in
my
life
saw
a
more
noble
or
a
more
engaging
aspect
than
his
he
was
dressed
like
those
of
his
persuasion
in
a
plain
coat
without
pleats
in
the
sides
or
buttons
on
the
pockets
and
sleeves
and
had
on
a
beaver
the
brims
of
which
were
horizontal
like
those
of
our
clergy
he
did
not
uncover
himself
when
i
appeared
and
advanced
towards
me
without
once
stooping
his
body
but
there
appeared
more
politeness
in
the
open
humane
air
of
his
countenance
than
in
the
custom
of
drawing
one
leg
behind
the
other
and
taking
that
from
the
head
which
is
made
to
cover
it
friend
says
he
to
me
i
perceive
thou
art
a
stranger
but
if
i
can
do
anything
for
thee
only
tell
me
sir
said
i
to
him
bending
forwards
and
advancing
as
is
usual
with
us
one
leg
towards
him
i
flatter
myself
that
my
just
curiosity
will
not
give
you
the
least
offence
and
that
you
do
me
the
honour
to
inform
me
of
the
particulars
of
your
religion
the
people
of
thy
country
replied
the
quaker
are
too
full
of
their
bows
and
compliments
but
i
never
yet
met
with
one
of
them
who
had
so
much
curiosity
as
thyself
come
in
and
let
us
first
dine
together
i
still
continued
to
make
some
very
unseasonable
ceremonies
it
not
being
easy
to
disengage
one
self
at
once
from
habits
we
have
been
long
used
to
and
after
taking
part
in
a
frugal
meal
which
began
and
ended
with
a
prayer
to
god
i
began
to
question
my
courteous
host
i
opened
with
that
which
good
catholics
have
more
than
once
made
to
huguenots
my
dear
sir
said
i
were
you
ever
baptised
i
never
was
replied
the
quaker
nor
any
of
my
brethren
zounds
say
i
to
him
you
are
not
christians
then
friend
replies
the
old
man
in
a
soft
tone
of
voice
swear
not
we
are
christians
and
endeavour
to
be
good
christians
but
we
are
not
of
opinion
that
the
sprinkling
water
on
a
child
head
makes
him
a
christian
heavens
say
i
shocked
at
his
impiety
you
have
then
forgot
that
christ
was
baptised
by
st
john
friend
replies
the
mild
quaker
once
again
swear
not
christ
indeed
was
baptised
by
john
but
he
himself
never
baptised
anyone
we
are
the
disciples
of
christ
not
of
john
i
pitied
very
much
the
sincerity
of
my
worthy
quaker
and
was
absolutely
for
forcing
him
to
get
himself
christened
were
that
all
replied
he
very
gravely
we
would
submit
cheerfully
to
baptism
purely
in
compliance
with
thy
weakness
for
we
do
condemn
any
person
who
uses
it
but
then
we
think
that
those
who
profess
a
religion
of
so
holy
so
spiritual
a
nature
as
that
of
christ
ought
to
abstain
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
from
the
jewish
ceremonies
o
unaccountable
say
i
what
baptism
a
jewish
ceremony
yes
my
friend
says
he
so
truly
jewish
that
a
great
many
jews
use
the
baptism
of
john
to
this
day
look
into
ancient
authors
and
thou
wilt
find
that
john
only
revived
this
practice
and
that
it
had
been
used
by
the
hebrews
long
before
his
time
in
like
manner
as
the
mahometans
imitated
the
ishmaelites
in
their
pilgrimages
to
mecca
jesus
indeed
submitted
to
the
baptism
of
john
as
he
had
suffered
himself
to
be
circumcised
but
circumcision
and
the
washing
with
water
ought
to
be
abolished
by
the
baptism
of
christ
that
baptism
of
the
spirit
that
ablution
of
the
soul
which
is
the
salvation
of
mankind
thus
the
forerunner
said
indeed
baptise
you
with
water
unto
repentance
but
he
that
cometh
after
me
is
mightier
than
i
whose
shoes
i
am
not
worthy
to
bear
he
shall
baptise
you
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
fire
likewise
paul
the
great
apostle
of
the
gentiles
writes
as
follows
to
the
corinthians
sent
me
not
to
baptise
but
to
preach
the
gospel
and
indeed
paul
never
baptised
but
two
persons
with
water
and
that
very
much
against
his
inclinations
he
circumcised
his
disciple
timothy
and
the
other
disciples
likewise
circumcised
all
who
were
willing
to
submit
to
that
carnal
ordinance
but
art
thou
circumcised
added
he
i
have
not
the
honour
to
be
so
say
i
well
friend
continues
the
quaker
thou
art
a
christian
without
being
circumcised
and
i
am
one
without
being
baptised
thus
did
this
pious
man
make
a
wrong
but
very
specious
application
of
four
or
five
texts
of
scripture
which
seemed
to
favour
the
tenets
of
his
sect
but
at
the
same
time
forgot
very
sincerely
an
hundred
texts
which
made
directly
against
them
i
had
more
sense
than
to
contest
with
him
since
there
is
no
possibility
of
convincing
an
enthusiast
a
man
should
never
pretend
to
inform
a
lover
of
his
mistress
faults
no
more
than
one
who
is
at
law
of
the
badness
of
his
cause
nor
attempt
to
win
over
a
fanatic
by
strength
of
reasoning
accordingly
i
waived
the
subject
well
said
i
to
him
what
sort
of
a
communion
have
you
we
have
none
like
that
thou
hintest
at
among
us
replied
he
how
no
communion
said
i
only
that
spiritual
one
replied
he
of
hearts
he
then
began
again
to
throw
out
his
texts
of
scripture
and
preached
a
most
eloquent
sermon
against
that
ordinance
he
harangued
in
a
tone
as
though
he
had
been
inspired
to
prove
that
the
sacraments
were
merely
of
human
invention
and
that
the
word
sacrament
was
not
once
mentioned
in
the
gospel
excuse
said
he
my
ignorance
for
i
have
not
employed
a
hundredth
part
of
the
arguments
which
might
be
brought
to
prove
the
truth
of
our
religion
but
these
thou
thyself
mayest
peruse
in
the
exposition
of
our
faith
written
by
robert
barclay
it
is
one
of
the
best
pieces
that
ever
was
penned
by
man
and
as
our
adversaries
confess
it
to
be
of
dangerous
tendency
the
arguments
in
it
must
necessarily
be
very
convincing
i
promised
to
peruse
this
piece
and
my
quaker
imagined
he
had
already
made
a
convert
of
me
he
afterwards
gave
me
an
account
in
few
words
of
some
singularities
which
make
this
sect
the
contempt
of
others
confess
said
he
that
it
was
very
difficult
for
thee
to
refrain
from
laughter
when
i
answered
all
thy
civilities
without
uncovering
my
head
and
at
the
same
time
said
and
to
thee
however
thou
appearest
to
me
too
well
read
not
to
know
that
in
time
no
nation
was
so
ridiculous
as
to
put
the
plural
number
for
the
singular
augustus
caesar
himself
was
spoken
to
in
such
phrases
as
these
love
thee
beseech
thee
thank
thee
but
he
did
not
allow
any
person
to
call
him
sir
it
was
not
till
many
ages
after
that
men
would
have
the
word
as
though
they
were
double
instead
of
employed
in
speaking
to
them
and
usurped
the
flattering
titles
of
lordship
of
eminence
and
of
holiness
which
mere
worms
bestow
on
other
worms
by
assuring
them
that
they
are
with
a
most
profound
respect
and
an
infamous
falsehood
their
most
obedient
humble
servants
it
is
to
secure
ourselves
more
strongly
from
such
a
shameless
traffic
of
lies
and
flattery
that
we
and
a
king
with
the
same
freedom
as
we
do
a
beggar
and
salute
no
person
we
owing
nothing
to
mankind
but
charity
and
to
the
laws
respect
and
obedience
our
apparel
is
also
somewhat
different
from
that
of
others
and
this
purely
that
it
may
be
a
perpetual
warning
to
us
not
to
imitate
them
others
wear
the
badges
and
marks
of
their
several
dignities
and
we
those
of
christian
humility
we
fly
from
all
assemblies
of
pleasure
from
diversions
of
every
kind
and
from
places
where
gaming
is
practised
and
indeed
our
case
would
be
very
deplorable
should
we
fill
with
such
levities
as
those
i
have
mentioned
the
heart
which
ought
to
be
the
habitation
of
god
we
never
swear
not
even
in
a
court
of
justice
being
of
opinion
that
the
most
holy
name
of
god
ought
not
to
be
prostituted
in
the
miserable
contests
betwixt
man
and
man
when
we
are
obliged
to
appear
before
a
magistrate
upon
other
people
account
for
are
unknown
among
the
friends
we
give
evidence
to
the
truth
by
sealing
it
with
our
yea
or
nay
and
the
judges
believe
us
on
our
bare
affirmation
whilst
so
many
other
christians
forswear
themselves
on
the
holy
gospels
we
never
war
or
fight
in
any
case
but
it
is
not
that
we
are
afraid
for
so
far
from
shuddering
at
the
thoughts
of
death
we
on
the
contrary
bless
the
moment
which
unites
us
with
the
being
of
beings
but
the
reason
of
our
not
using
the
outward
sword
is
that
we
are
neither
wolves
tigers
nor
mastiffs
but
men
and
christians
our
god
who
has
commanded
us
to
love
our
enemies
and
to
suffer
without
repining
would
certainly
not
permit
us
to
cross
the
seas
merely
because
murderers
clothed
in
scarlet
and
wearing
caps
two
foot
high
enlist
citizens
by
a
noise
made
with
two
little
sticks
on
an
ass
skin
extended
and
when
after
a
victory
is
gained
the
whole
city
of
london
is
illuminated
when
the
sky
is
in
a
blaze
with
fireworks
and
a
noise
is
heard
in
the
air
of
thanksgivings
of
bells
of
organs
and
of
the
cannon
we
groan
in
silence
and
are
deeply
affected
with
sadness
of
spirit
and
brokenness
of
heart
for
the
sad
havoc
which
is
the
occasion
of
those
public
rejoicings
letter
on
the
quakers
such
was
the
substance
of
the
conversation
i
had
with
this
very
singular
person
but
i
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
him
come
the
sunday
following
and
take
me
with
him
to
the
quakers
meeting
there
are
several
of
these
in
london
but
that
which
he
carried
me
to
stands
near
the
famous
pillar
called
the
monument
the
brethren
were
already
assembled
at
my
entering
it
with
my
guide
there
might
be
about
four
hundred
men
and
three
hundred
women
in
the
meeting
the
women
hid
their
faces
behind
their
fans
and
the
men
were
covered
with
their
hats
all
were
seated
and
the
silence
was
universal
i
passed
through
them
but
did
not
perceive
so
much
as
one
lift
up
his
eyes
to
look
at
me
this
silence
lasted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
at
last
one
of
them
rose
up
took
off
his
hat
and
after
making
a
variety
of
wry
faces
and
groaning
in
a
most
lamentable
manner
he
partly
from
his
nose
and
partly
from
his
mouth
threw
out
a
strange
confused
jumble
of
words
borrowed
as
he
imagined
from
the
gospel
which
neither
himself
nor
any
of
his
hearers
understood
when
this
distorter
had
ended
his
beautiful
soliloquy
and
that
the
stupid
but
greatly
edified
congregation
were
separated
i
asked
my
friend
how
it
was
possible
for
the
judicious
part
of
their
assembly
to
suffer
such
a
babbling
we
are
obliged
says
he
to
suffer
it
because
no
one
knows
when
a
man
rises
up
to
hold
forth
whether
he
will
be
moved
by
the
spirit
or
by
folly
in
this
doubt
and
uncertainty
we
listen
patiently
to
everyone
we
even
allow
our
women
to
hold
forth
two
or
three
of
these
are
often
inspired
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
it
is
then
that
a
most
charming
noise
is
heard
in
the
lord
house
you
have
then
no
priests
say
i
to
him
no
no
friend
replies
the
quaker
to
our
great
happiness
then
opening
one
of
the
books
as
he
called
it
he
read
the
following
words
in
an
emphatic
tone
forbid
we
should
presume
to
ordain
anyone
to
receive
the
holy
spirit
on
the
lord
day
to
the
prejudice
of
the
rest
of
the
brethren
thanks
to
the
almighty
we
are
the
only
people
upon
earth
that
have
no
priests
wouldst
thou
deprive
us
of
so
happy
a
distinction
why
should
we
abandon
our
babe
to
mercenary
nurses
when
we
ourselves
have
milk
enough
for
it
these
mercenary
creatures
would
soon
domineer
in
our
houses
and
destroy
both
the
mother
and
the
babe
god
has
said
you
have
received
freely
give
shall
we
after
these
words
cheapen
as
it
were
the
gospel
sell
the
holy
ghost
and
make
of
an
assembly
of
christians
a
mere
shop
of
traders
we
do
pay
a
set
of
men
clothed
in
black
to
assist
our
poor
to
bury
our
dead
or
to
preach
to
the
brethren
these
offices
are
all
of
too
tender
a
nature
for
us
ever
to
entrust
them
to
others
but
how
is
it
possible
for
you
said
i
with
some
warmth
to
know
whether
your
discourse
is
really
inspired
by
the
almighty
whosoever
says
he
shall
implore
christ
to
enlighten
him
and
shall
publish
the
gospel
truths
he
may
feel
inwardly
such
an
one
may
be
assured
that
he
is
inspired
by
the
lord
he
then
poured
forth
a
numberless
multitude
of
scripture
texts
which
proved
as
he
imagined
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
christianity
without
an
immediate
revelation
and
added
these
remarkable
words
when
thou
movest
one
of
thy
limbs
is
it
moved
by
thy
own
power
certainly
not
for
this
limb
is
often
sensible
to
involuntary
motions
consequently
he
who
created
thy
body
gives
motion
to
this
earthly
tabernacle
and
are
the
several
ideas
of
which
thy
soul
receives
the
impression
formed
by
thyself
much
less
are
they
since
these
pour
in
upon
thy
mind
whether
thou
wilt
or
no
consequently
thou
receivest
thy
ideas
from
him
who
created
thy
soul
but
as
he
leaves
thy
affections
at
full
liberty
he
gives
thy
mind
such
ideas
as
thy
affections
may
deserve
if
thou
livest
in
god
thou
actest
thou
thinkest
in
god
after
this
thou
needest
only
but
open
thine
eyes
to
that
light
which
enlightens
all
mankind
and
it
is
then
thou
wilt
perceive
the
truth
and
make
others
perceive
it
why
this
said
i
is
malebranche
doctrine
to
a
tittle
i
am
acquainted
with
thy
malebranche
said
he
he
had
something
of
the
friend
in
him
but
was
not
enough
so
these
are
the
most
considerable
particulars
i
learnt
concerning
the
doctrine
of
the
quakers
in
my
next
letter
i
shall
acquaint
you
with
their
history
which
you
will
find
more
singular
than
their
opinions
letter
on
the
quakers
you
have
already
heard
that
the
quakers
date
from
christ
who
according
to
them
was
the
first
quaker
religion
say
these
was
corrupted
a
little
after
his
death
and
remained
in
that
state
of
corruption
about
sixteen
hundred
years
but
there
were
always
a
few
quakers
concealed
in
the
world
who
carefully
preserved
the
sacred
fire
which
was
extinguished
in
all
but
themselves
until
at
last
this
light
spread
itself
in
england
in
it
was
at
the
time
when
great
britain
was
torn
to
pieces
by
the
intestine
wars
which
three
or
four
sects
had
raised
in
the
name
of
god
that
one
george
fox
born
in
leicestershire
and
son
to
a
took
it
into
his
head
to
preach
and
as
he
pretended
with
all
the
requisites
of
a
true
apostle
that
is
without
being
able
either
to
read
or
write
he
was
about
years
of
age
irreproachable
in
his
life
and
conduct
and
a
holy
madman
he
was
equipped
in
leather
from
head
to
foot
and
travelled
from
one
village
to
another
exclaiming
against
war
and
the
clergy
had
his
invectives
been
levelled
against
the
soldiery
only
he
would
have
been
safe
enough
but
he
inveighed
against
ecclesiastics
fox
was
seized
at
derby
and
being
carried
before
a
justice
of
peace
he
did
not
once
offer
to
pull
off
his
leathern
hat
upon
which
an
officer
gave
him
a
great
box
of
the
ear
and
cried
to
him
do
you
know
you
are
to
appear
uncovered
before
his
worship
fox
presented
his
other
cheek
to
the
officer
and
begged
him
to
give
him
another
box
for
god
sake
the
justice
would
have
had
him
sworn
before
he
asked
him
any
questions
know
friend
says
fox
to
him
that
i
never
swear
the
justice
observing
he
thee
and
thou
him
sent
him
to
the
house
of
correction
in
derby
with
orders
that
he
should
be
whipped
there
fox
praised
the
lord
all
the
way
he
went
to
the
house
of
correction
where
the
justice
order
was
executed
with
the
utmost
severity
the
men
who
whipped
this
enthusiast
were
greatly
surprised
to
hear
him
beseech
them
to
give
him
a
few
more
lashes
for
the
good
of
his
soul
there
was
no
need
of
entreating
these
people
the
lashes
were
repeated
for
which
fox
thanked
them
very
cordially
and
began
to
preach
at
first
the
spectators
fell
but
they
afterwards
listened
to
him
and
as
enthusiasm
is
an
epidemical
distemper
many
were
persuaded
and
those
who
scourged
him
became
his
first
disciples
being
set
at
liberty
he
ran
up
and
down
the
country
with
a
dozen
proselytes
at
his
heels
still
declaiming
against
the
clergy
and
was
whipped
from
time
to
time
being
one
day
set
in
the
pillory
he
harangued
the
crowd
in
so
strong
and
moving
a
manner
that
fifty
of
the
auditors
became
his
converts
and
he
won
the
rest
so
much
in
his
favour
that
his
head
being
freed
tumultuously
from
the
hole
where
it
was
fastened
the
populace
went
and
searched
for
the
church
of
england
clergyman
who
had
been
chiefly
instrumental
in
bringing
him
to
this
punishment
and
set
him
on
the
same
pillory
where
fox
had
stood
fox
was
bold
enough
to
convert
some
of
oliver
cromwell
soldiers
who
thereupon
quitted
the
service
and
refused
to
take
the
oaths
oliver
having
as
great
a
contempt
for
a
sect
which
would
not
allow
its
members
to
fight
as
sixtus
quintus
had
for
another
sect
non
si
began
to
persecute
these
new
converts
the
prisons
were
crowded
with
them
but
persecution
seldom
has
any
other
effect
than
to
increase
the
number
of
proselytes
these
came
therefore
from
their
confinement
more
strongly
confirmed
in
the
principles
they
had
imbibed
and
followed
by
their
gaolers
whom
they
had
brought
over
to
their
belief
but
the
circumstances
which
contributed
chiefly
to
the
spreading
of
this
sect
were
as
follows
fox
thought
himself
inspired
and
consequently
was
of
opinion
that
he
must
speak
in
a
manner
different
from
the
rest
of
mankind
he
thereupon
began
to
writhe
his
body
to
screw
up
his
face
to
hold
in
his
breath
and
to
exhale
it
in
a
forcible
manner
insomuch
that
the
priestess
of
the
pythian
god
at
delphos
could
not
have
acted
her
part
to
better
advantage
inspiration
soon
became
so
habitual
to
him
that
he
could
scarce
deliver
himself
in
any
other
manner
this
was
the
first
gift
he
communicated
to
his
disciples
these
aped
very
sincerely
their
master
several
grimaces
and
shook
in
every
limb
the
instant
the
fit
of
inspiration
came
upon
them
whence
they
were
called
quakers
the
vulgar
attempted
to
mimic
them
they
trembled
they
spake
through
the
nose
they
quaked
and
fancied
themselves
inspired
by
the
holy
ghost
the
only
thing
now
wanting
was
a
few
miracles
and
accordingly
they
wrought
some
fox
this
modern
patriarch
spoke
thus
to
a
justice
of
peace
before
a
large
assembly
of
people
friend
take
care
what
thou
dost
god
will
soon
punish
thee
for
persecuting
his
saints
this
magistrate
being
one
who
besotted
himself
every
day
with
bad
beer
and
brandy
died
of
an
apoplexy
two
days
after
the
moment
he
had
signed
a
for
imprisoning
some
quakers
the
sudden
death
with
which
this
justice
was
seized
was
not
ascribed
to
his
intemperance
but
was
universally
looked
upon
as
the
effect
of
the
holy
man
predictions
so
that
this
accident
made
more
converts
to
quakerism
than
a
thousand
sermons
and
as
many
shaking
fits
could
have
done
oliver
finding
them
increase
daily
was
desirous
of
bringing
them
over
to
his
party
and
for
that
purpose
attempted
to
bribe
them
by
money
however
they
were
incorruptible
which
made
him
one
day
declare
that
this
religion
was
the
only
one
he
had
ever
met
with
that
had
resisted
the
charms
of
gold
the
quakers
were
several
times
persecuted
under
charles
ii
not
upon
a
religious
account
but
for
refusing
to
pay
the
tithes
for
theeing
and
thouing
the
magistrates
and
for
refusing
to
take
the
oaths
enacted
by
the
laws
at
last
robert
barclay
a
native
of
scotland
presented
to
the
king
in
his
apology
for
the
quakers
a
work
as
well
drawn
up
as
the
subject
could
possibly
admit
the
dedication
to
charles
ii
is
not
filled
with
mean
flattering
encomiums
but
abounds
with
bold
touches
in
favour
of
truth
and
with
the
wisest
counsels
thou
hast
tasted
says
he
to
the
king
at
the
close
of
his
epistle
dedicatory
of
prosperity
and
adversity
thou
knowest
what
it
is
to
be
banished
thy
native
country
to
be
overruled
as
well
as
to
rule
and
sit
upon
the
throne
and
being
oppressed
thou
hast
reason
to
know
how
hateful
the
oppressor
is
both
to
god
and
man
if
after
all
these
warnings
and
advertisements
thou
dost
not
turn
unto
the
lord
with
all
thy
heart
but
forget
him
who
remembered
thee
in
thy
distress
and
give
up
thyself
to
follow
lust
and
vanity
surely
great
will
be
thy
condemnation
against
which
snare
as
well
as
the
temptation
of
those
that
may
or
do
feed
thee
and
prompt
thee
to
evil
the
most
excellent
and
prevalent
remedy
will
be
to
apply
thyself
to
that
light
of
christ
which
shineth
in
thy
conscience
which
neither
can
nor
will
flatter
thee
nor
suffer
thee
to
be
at
ease
in
thy
sins
but
doth
and
will
deal
plainly
and
faithfully
with
thee
as
those
that
are
followers
thereof
have
plainly
thy
faithful
friend
and
subject
robert
barclay
a
more
surprising
circumstance
is
that
this
epistle
written
by
a
private
man
of
no
figure
was
so
happy
in
its
effects
as
to
put
a
stop
to
the
persecution
letter
on
the
quakers
about
this
time
arose
the
illustrious
william
penn
who
established
the
power
of
the
quakers
in
america
and
would
have
made
them
appear
venerable
in
the
eyes
of
the
europeans
were
it
possible
for
mankind
to
respect
virtue
when
revealed
in
a
ridiculous
light
he
was
the
only
son
of
penn
favourite
of
the
duke
of
york
afterwards
king
james
ii
william
penn
at
twenty
years
of
age
happening
to
meet
with
a
quaker
in
cork
whom
he
had
known
at
oxford
this
man
made
a
proselyte
of
him
and
william
being
a
sprightly
youth
and
naturally
eloquent
having
a
winning
aspect
and
a
very
engaging
carriage
he
soon
gained
over
some
of
his
intimates
he
carried
matters
so
far
that
he
formed
by
insensible
degrees
a
society
of
young
quakers
who
met
at
his
house
so
that
he
was
at
the
head
of
a
sect
when
a
little
above
twenty
being
returned
after
his
leaving
cork
to
the
his
father
instead
of
falling
upon
his
knees
to
ask
his
blessing
he
went
up
to
him
with
his
hat
on
and
said
friend
i
am
very
glad
to
see
thee
in
good
health
the
imagined
his
son
to
be
crazy
but
soon
finding
he
was
turned
quaker
he
employed
all
the
methods
that
prudence
could
suggest
to
engage
him
to
behave
and
act
like
other
people
the
youth
made
no
other
answer
to
his
father
than
by
exhorting
him
to
turn
quaker
also
at
last
his
father
confined
himself
to
this
single
request
that
he
should
wait
upon
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
and
should
not
and
them
william
answered
that
he
could
not
do
these
things
for
conscience
sake
which
exasperated
his
father
to
such
a
degree
that
he
turned
him
out
of
doors
young
pen
gave
god
thanks
for
permitting
him
to
suffer
so
early
in
his
cause
after
which
he
went
into
the
city
where
he
held
forth
and
made
a
great
number
of
converts
the
church
of
england
clergy
found
their
congregations
dwindle
away
daily
and
penn
being
young
handsome
and
of
a
graceful
stature
the
court
as
well
as
the
city
ladies
flocked
very
devoutly
to
his
meeting
the
patriarch
george
fox
hearing
of
his
great
reputation
came
to
london
though
the
journey
was
very
long
purely
to
see
and
converse
with
him
both
resolved
to
go
upon
missions
into
foreign
countries
and
accordingly
they
embarked
for
holland
after
having
left
labourers
sufficient
to
take
care
of
the
london
vineyard
their
labours
were
crowned
with
success
in
amsterdam
but
a
circumstance
which
reflected
the
greatest
honour
on
them
and
at
the
same
time
put
their
humility
to
the
greatest
trial
was
the
reception
they
met
with
from
elizabeth
the
princess
palatine
aunt
to
george
of
great
britain
a
lady
conspicuous
for
her
genius
and
knowledge
and
to
whom
descartes
had
dedicated
his
philosophical
romance
she
was
then
retired
to
the
hague
where
she
received
these
friends
for
so
the
quakers
were
at
that
time
called
in
holland
this
princess
had
several
conferences
with
them
in
her
palace
and
she
at
last
entertained
so
favourable
an
opinion
of
quakerism
that
they
confessed
she
was
not
far
from
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
friends
sowed
likewise
the
good
seed
in
germany
but
reaped
very
little
fruit
for
the
mode
of
theeing
and
thouing
was
not
approved
of
in
a
country
where
a
man
is
perpetually
obliged
to
employ
the
titles
of
highness
and
excellency
william
penn
returned
soon
to
england
upon
hearing
of
his
father
sickness
in
order
to
see
him
before
he
died
the
was
reconciled
to
his
son
and
though
of
a
different
persuasion
embraced
him
tenderly
william
made
a
fruitless
exhortation
to
his
father
not
to
receive
the
sacrament
but
to
die
a
quaker
and
the
good
old
man
entreated
his
son
william
to
wear
buttons
on
his
sleeves
and
a
crape
hatband
in
his
beaver
but
all
to
no
purpose
william
penn
inherited
very
large
possessions
part
of
which
consisted
in
crown
debts
due
to
the
for
sums
he
had
advanced
for
the
sea
service
no
moneys
were
at
that
time
more
insecure
than
those
owing
from
the
king
penn
was
obliged
to
go
more
than
once
and
thee
and
thou
king
charles
and
his
ministers
in
order
to
recover
the
debt
and
at
last
instead
of
specie
the
government
invested
him
with
the
right
and
sovereignty
of
a
province
of
america
to
the
south
of
maryland
thus
was
a
quaker
raised
to
sovereign
power
penn
set
sail
for
his
new
dominions
with
two
ships
freighted
with
quakers
who
followed
his
fortune
the
country
was
then
called
pennsylvania
from
william
penn
who
there
founded
philadelphia
now
the
most
flourishing
city
in
that
country
the
first
step
he
took
was
to
enter
into
an
alliance
with
his
american
neighbours
and
this
is
the
only
treaty
between
those
people
and
the
christians
that
was
not
ratified
by
an
oath
and
was
never
infringed
the
new
sovereign
was
at
the
same
time
the
legislator
of
pennsylvania
and
enacted
very
wise
and
prudent
laws
none
of
which
have
ever
been
changed
since
his
time
the
first
is
to
injure
no
person
upon
a
religious
account
and
to
consider
as
brethren
all
those
who
believe
in
one
god
he
had
no
sooner
settled
his
government
but
several
american
merchants
came
and
peopled
this
colony
the
natives
of
the
country
instead
of
flying
into
the
woods
cultivated
by
insensible
degrees
a
friendship
with
the
peaceable
quakers
they
loved
these
foreigners
as
much
as
they
detested
the
other
christians
who
had
conquered
and
laid
waste
america
in
a
little
time
a
great
number
of
these
savages
falsely
so
called
charmed
with
the
mild
and
gentle
disposition
of
their
neighbours
came
in
crowds
to
william
penn
and
besought
him
to
admit
them
into
the
number
of
his
vassals
it
was
very
rare
and
uncommon
for
a
sovereign
to
be
thee
and
thou
by
the
meanest
of
his
subjects
who
never
took
their
hats
off
when
they
came
into
his
presence
and
as
singular
for
a
government
to
be
without
one
priest
in
it
and
for
a
people
to
be
without
arms
either
offensive
or
defensive
for
a
body
of
citizens
to
be
absolutely
undistinguished
but
by
the
public
employments
and
for
neighbours
not
to
entertain
the
least
jealousy
one
against
the
other
william
penn
might
glory
in
having
brought
down
upon
earth
the
so
much
boasted
golden
age
which
in
all
probability
never
existed
but
in
pennsylvania
he
returned
to
england
to
settle
some
affairs
relating
to
his
new
dominions
after
the
death
of
king
charles
king
james
who
had
loved
the
father
indulged
the
same
affection
to
the
son
and
no
longer
considered
him
as
an
obscure
sectary
but
as
a
very
great
man
the
king
politics
on
this
occasion
agreed
with
his
inclinations
he
was
desirous
of
pleasing
the
quakers
by
annulling
the
laws
made
against
nonconformists
in
order
to
have
an
opportunity
by
this
universal
toleration
of
establishing
the
romish
religion
all
the
sectarists
in
england
saw
the
snare
that
was
laid
for
them
but
did
not
give
into
it
they
never
failing
to
unite
when
the
romish
religion
their
common
enemy
is
to
be
opposed
but
penn
did
not
think
himself
bound
in
any
manner
to
renounce
his
principles
merely
to
favour
protestants
to
whom
he
was
odious
in
opposition
to
a
king
who
loved
him
he
had
established
a
universal
toleration
with
regard
to
conscience
in
america
and
would
not
have
it
thought
that
he
intended
to
destroy
it
in
europe
for
which
reason
he
adhered
so
inviolably
to
king
james
that
a
report
prevailed
universally
of
his
being
a
jesuit
this
calumny
affected
him
very
strongly
and
he
was
obliged
to
justify
himself
in
print
however
the
unfortunate
king
james
in
whom
as
in
most
princes
of
the
stuart
family
grandeur
and
weakness
were
equally
blended
and
who
like
them
as
much
overdid
some
things
as
he
was
short
in
others
lost
his
kingdom
in
a
manner
that
is
hardly
to
be
accounted
for
all
the
english
sectarists
accepted
from
william
iii
and
his
parliament
the
toleration
and
indulgence
which
they
had
refused
when
offered
by
king
james
it
was
then
the
quakers
began
to
enjoy
by
virtue
of
the
laws
the
several
privileges
they
possess
at
this
time
penn
having
at
last
seen
quakerism
firmly
established
in
his
native
country
went
back
to
pennsylvania
his
own
people
and
the
americans
received
him
with
tears
of
joy
as
though
he
had
been
a
father
who
was
returned
to
visit
his
children
all
the
laws
had
been
religiously
observed
in
his
absence
a
circumstance
in
which
no
legislator
had
ever
been
happy
but
himself
after
having
resided
some
years
in
pennsylvania
he
left
it
but
with
great
reluctance
in
order
to
return
to
england
there
to
solicit
some
matters
in
favour
of
the
commerce
of
pennsylvania
but
he
never
saw
it
again
he
dying
in
ruscombe
in
berkshire
in
i
am
not
able
to
guess
what
fate
quakerism
may
have
in
america
but
i
perceive
it
dwindles
away
daily
in
england
in
all
countries
where
liberty
of
conscience
is
allowed
the
established
religion
will
at
last
swallow
up
all
the
rest
quakers
are
disqualified
from
being
members
of
parliament
nor
can
they
enjoy
any
post
or
preferment
because
an
oath
must
always
be
taken
on
these
occasions
and
they
never
swear
they
are
therefore
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
subsisting
upon
traffic
their
children
whom
the
industry
of
their
parents
has
enriched
are
desirous
of
enjoying
honours
of
wearing
buttons
and
ruffles
and
quite
ashamed
of
being
called
quakers
they
become
converts
to
the
church
of
england
merely
to
be
in
the
fashion
letter
on
the
church
of
england
england
is
properly
the
country
of
sectarists
sunt
mansiones
in
domo
patris
in
my
father
house
are
many
mansions
an
englishman
as
one
to
whom
liberty
is
natural
may
go
to
heaven
his
own
way
nevertheless
though
every
one
is
permitted
to
serve
god
in
whatever
mode
or
fashion
he
thinks
proper
yet
their
true
religion
that
in
which
a
man
makes
his
fortune
is
the
sect
of
episcopalians
or
churchmen
called
the
church
of
england
or
simply
the
church
by
way
of
eminence
no
person
can
possess
an
employment
either
in
england
or
ireland
unless
he
be
ranked
among
the
faithful
that
is
professes
himself
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
this
reason
which
carries
mathematical
evidence
with
it
has
converted
such
numbers
of
dissenters
of
all
persuasions
that
not
a
twentieth
part
of
the
nation
is
out
of
the
pale
of
the
established
church
the
english
clergy
have
retained
a
great
number
of
the
romish
ceremonies
and
especially
that
of
receiving
with
a
most
scrupulous
attention
their
tithes
they
also
have
the
pious
ambition
to
aim
at
superiority
moreover
they
inspire
very
religiously
their
flock
with
a
holy
zeal
against
dissenters
of
all
denominations
this
zeal
was
pretty
violent
under
the
tories
in
the
four
last
years
of
queen
anne
but
was
productive
of
no
greater
mischief
than
the
breaking
the
windows
of
some
and
the
demolishing
of
a
few
of
them
for
religious
rage
ceased
in
england
with
the
civil
wars
and
was
no
more
under
queen
anne
than
the
hollow
noise
of
a
sea
whose
billows
still
heaved
though
so
long
after
the
storm
when
the
whigs
and
tories
laid
waste
their
native
country
in
the
same
manner
as
the
guelphs
and
ghibelins
formerly
did
theirs
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
both
parties
to
call
in
religion
on
this
occasion
the
tories
declared
for
episcopacy
and
the
whigs
as
some
imagined
were
for
abolishing
it
however
after
these
had
got
the
upper
hand
they
contented
themselves
with
only
abridging
it
at
the
time
when
the
earl
of
oxford
and
the
lord
bolingbroke
used
to
drink
healths
to
the
tories
the
church
of
england
considered
those
noblemen
as
the
defenders
of
its
holy
privileges
the
lower
house
of
convocation
a
kind
of
house
of
commons
composed
wholly
of
the
clergy
was
in
some
credit
at
that
time
at
least
the
members
of
it
had
the
liberty
to
meet
to
dispute
on
ecclesiastical
matters
to
sentence
impious
books
from
time
to
time
to
the
flames
that
is
books
written
against
themselves
the
ministry
which
is
now
composed
of
whigs
does
not
so
much
as
allow
those
gentlemen
to
assemble
so
that
they
are
at
this
time
reduced
in
the
obscurity
of
their
respective
parishes
to
the
melancholy
occupation
of
praying
for
the
prosperity
of
the
government
whose
tranquillity
they
would
willingly
disturb
with
regard
to
the
bishops
who
are
in
all
they
still
have
seats
in
the
house
of
lords
in
spite
of
the
whigs
because
the
ancient
abuse
of
considering
them
as
barons
subsists
to
this
day
there
is
a
clause
however
in
the
oath
which
the
government
requires
from
these
gentlemen
that
puts
their
christian
patience
to
a
very
great
trial
that
they
shall
be
of
the
church
of
england
as
by
law
established
there
are
few
bishops
deans
or
other
dignitaries
but
imagine
they
are
so
it
is
consequently
a
great
mortification
to
them
to
be
obliged
to
confess
that
they
owe
their
dignity
to
a
pitiful
law
enacted
by
a
set
of
profane
laymen
a
learned
monk
father
courayer
wrote
a
book
lately
to
prove
the
validity
and
succession
of
english
ordinations
this
book
was
forbid
in
france
but
do
you
believe
that
the
english
ministry
were
pleased
with
it
far
from
it
those
wicked
whigs
do
care
a
straw
whether
the
episcopal
succession
among
them
hath
been
interrupted
or
not
or
whether
bishop
parker
was
consecrated
as
it
is
pretended
in
a
tavern
or
a
church
for
these
whigs
are
much
better
pleased
that
the
bishops
should
derive
their
authority
from
the
parliament
than
from
the
apostles
the
lord
bolingbroke
observed
that
this
notion
of
divine
right
would
only
make
so
many
tyrants
in
lawn
sleeves
but
that
the
laws
made
so
many
citizens
with
regard
to
the
morals
of
the
english
clergy
they
are
more
regular
than
those
of
france
and
for
this
reason
all
the
clergy
a
very
few
excepted
are
educated
in
the
universities
of
oxford
or
cambridge
far
from
the
depravity
and
corruption
which
reign
in
the
capital
they
are
not
called
to
dignities
till
very
late
at
a
time
of
life
when
men
are
sensible
of
no
other
passion
but
avarice
that
is
when
their
ambition
craves
a
supply
employments
are
here
bestowed
both
in
the
church
and
the
army
as
a
reward
for
long
services
and
we
never
see
youngsters
made
bishops
or
colonels
immediately
upon
their
laying
aside
the
academical
gown
and
besides
most
of
the
clergy
are
married
the
stiff
and
awkward
air
contracted
by
them
at
the
university
and
the
little
familiarity
the
men
of
this
country
have
with
the
ladies
commonly
oblige
a
bishop
to
confine
himself
to
and
rest
contented
with
his
own
clergymen
sometimes
take
a
glass
at
the
tavern
custom
giving
them
a
sanction
on
this
occasion
and
if
they
fuddle
themselves
it
is
in
a
very
serious
manner
and
without
giving
the
least
scandal
that
kind
of
mortal
not
to
be
defined
who
is
neither
of
the
clergy
nor
of
the
laity
in
a
word
the
thing
called
in
france
is
a
species
quite
unknown
in
england
all
the
clergy
here
are
very
much
upon
the
reserve
and
most
of
them
pedants
when
these
are
told
that
in
france
young
fellows
famous
for
their
dissoluteness
and
raised
to
the
highest
dignities
of
the
church
by
female
intrigues
address
the
fair
publicly
in
an
amorous
way
amuse
themselves
in
writing
tender
love
songs
entertain
their
friends
very
splendidly
every
night
at
their
own
houses
and
after
the
banquet
is
ended
withdraw
to
invoke
the
assistance
of
the
holy
ghost
and
call
themselves
boldly
the
successors
of
the
apostles
they
bless
god
for
their
being
protestants
but
these
are
shameless
heretics
who
deserve
to
be
blown
hence
through
the
flames
to
old
nick
as
rabelais
says
and
for
this
reason
i
do
not
trouble
myself
about
them
letter
on
the
presbyterians
the
church
of
england
is
confined
almost
to
the
kingdom
whence
it
received
its
name
and
to
ireland
for
presbyterianism
is
the
established
religion
in
scotland
this
presbyterianism
is
directly
the
same
with
calvinism
as
it
was
established
in
france
and
is
now
professed
at
geneva
as
the
priests
of
this
sect
receive
but
very
inconsiderable
stipends
from
their
churches
and
consequently
can
not
emulate
the
splendid
luxury
of
bishops
they
exclaim
very
naturally
against
honours
which
they
can
never
attain
to
figure
to
yourself
the
haughty
diogenes
trampling
under
foot
the
pride
of
plato
the
scotch
presbyterians
are
not
very
unlike
that
proud
though
tattered
reasoner
diogenes
did
not
use
alexander
half
so
impertinently
as
these
treated
king
charles
ii
for
when
they
took
up
arms
in
his
cause
in
opposition
to
oliver
who
had
deceived
them
they
forced
that
poor
monarch
to
undergo
the
hearing
of
three
or
four
sermons
every
day
would
not
suffer
him
to
play
reduced
him
to
a
state
of
penitence
and
mortification
so
that
charles
soon
grew
sick
of
these
pedants
and
accordingly
eloped
from
them
with
as
much
joy
as
a
youth
does
from
school
a
church
of
england
minister
appears
as
another
cato
in
presence
of
a
juvenile
sprightly
french
graduate
who
bawls
for
a
whole
morning
together
in
the
divinity
schools
and
hums
a
song
in
chorus
with
ladies
in
the
evening
but
this
cato
is
a
very
spark
when
before
a
scotch
presbyterian
the
latter
affects
a
serious
gait
puts
on
a
sour
look
wears
a
vastly
hat
and
a
long
cloak
over
a
very
short
coat
preaches
through
the
nose
and
gives
the
name
of
the
whore
of
babylon
to
all
churches
where
the
ministers
are
so
fortunate
as
to
enjoy
an
annual
revenue
of
five
or
six
thousand
pounds
and
where
the
people
are
weak
enough
to
suffer
this
and
to
give
them
the
titles
of
my
lord
your
lordship
or
your
eminence
these
gentlemen
who
have
also
some
churches
in
england
introduced
there
the
mode
of
grave
and
severe
exhortations
to
them
is
owing
the
sanctification
of
sunday
in
the
three
kingdoms
people
are
there
forbidden
to
work
or
take
any
recreation
on
that
day
in
which
the
severity
is
twice
as
great
as
that
of
the
romish
church
no
operas
plays
or
concerts
are
allowed
in
london
on
sundays
and
even
cards
are
so
expressly
forbidden
that
none
but
persons
of
quality
and
those
we
call
the
genteel
play
on
that
day
the
rest
of
the
nation
go
either
to
church
to
the
tavern
or
to
see
their
mistresses
though
the
episcopal
and
presbyterian
sects
are
the
two
prevailing
ones
in
great
britain
yet
all
others
are
very
welcome
to
come
and
settle
in
it
and
live
very
sociably
together
though
most
of
their
preachers
hate
one
another
almost
as
cordially
as
a
jansenist
damns
a
jesuit
take
a
view
of
the
royal
exchange
in
london
a
place
more
venerable
than
many
courts
of
justice
where
the
representatives
of
all
nations
meet
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
there
the
jew
the
mahometan
and
the
christian
transact
together
as
though
they
all
professed
the
same
religion
and
give
the
name
of
infidel
to
none
but
bankrupts
there
the
presbyterian
confides
in
the
anabaptist
and
the
churchman
depends
on
the
word
if
one
religion
only
were
allowed
in
england
the
government
would
very
possibly
become
arbitrary
if
there
were
but
two

people
would
cut
one
another
throats

as
there
are
such
a
multitude
they
all
live
happy

in
peace
letter
on
the
socinians

arians
or
antitrinitarians
there
is
a
little
sect
here
composed
of
clergymen
and
of
a
few
very
learned
persons
among
the
laity
who
though
they
do
not
call
themselves
arians
or
socinians
do
yet
dissent
entirely
from
athanasius
with
regard
to
their
notions
of
the
trinity
and
declare
very
frankly
that
the
father
is
greater
than
the
son

you
remember

is
related
of
a
certain
orthodox
bishop
who
in
order
to
convince
an
emperor
of
the
reality
of
consubstantiation
put
his
hand
under
the
chin
of
the
monarch
son
and
took
him
by
the
nose
in
presence
of
his
sacred
majesty
the
emperor
was
going
to
order
his
attendants
to
throw
the
bishop
out
of
the
window
when
the
good
old
man
gave
him
this
handsome
and
convincing
reason
since
your
majesty
says
he
is
angry
when
your
son
has
not
due
respect
shown
him
what
punishment
do
you
think
will
god
the
father
inflict
on
those
who
refuse
his
son
jesus
the
titles
due
to
him
the
persons
i
just
now
mentioned
declare
that
the
holy
bishop
took
a
very
wrong
step
that
his
argument
was
inconclusive
and
that
the
emperor
should
have
answered
him
thus
know
that
there
are
two
ways
by
which
men
may
be
wanting
in
respect
to
me
first
in
not
doing
honour
sufficient
to
my
son
and
secondly
in
paying
him
the
same
honour
as
to
me
be
this
as
it
will
the
principles
of
arius
begin
to
revive
not
only
in
england
but
in
holland
and
poland
the
celebrated
sir
isaac
newton
honoured
this
opinion
so
far
as
to
countenance
it
this
philosopher
thought
that
the
unitarians
argued
more
mathematically
than
we
do
but
the
most
sanguine
stickler
for
arianism
is
the
illustrious
clark
this
man
is
rigidly
virtuous
and
of
a
mild
disposition
is
more
fond
of
his
tenets
than
desirous
of
propagating
them
and
absorbed
so
entirely
in
problems
and
calculations
that
he
is
a
mere
reasoning
machine
it
is
he
who
wrote
a
book
which
is
much
esteemed
and
little
understood
on
the
existence
of
god
and
another
more
intelligible
but
pretty
much
contemned
on
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
he
never
engaged
in
scholastic
disputes
which
our
friend
calls
venerable
trifles
he
only
published
a
work
containing
all
the
testimonies
of
the
primitive
ages
for
and
against
the
unitarians
and
leaves
to
the
reader
the
counting
of
the
voices
and
the
liberty
of
forming
a
judgment
this
book
won
the
doctor
a
great
number
of
partisans
and
lost
him
the
see
of
canterbury
but
in
my
humble
opinion
he
was
out
in
his
calculation
and
had
better
have
been
primate
of
all
england
than
merely
an
arian
parson
you
see
that
opinions
are
subject
to
revolutions
as
well
as
empires
arianism
after
having
triumphed
during
three
centuries
and
been
forgot
twelve
rises
at
last
out
of
its
own
ashes
but
it
has
chosen
a
very
improper
season
to
make
its
appearance
in
the
present
age
being
quite
cloyed
with
disputes
and
sects
the
members
of
this
sect
are
besides
too
few
to
be
indulged
the
liberty
of
holding
public
assemblies
which
however
they
will
doubtless
be
permitted
to
do
in
case
they
spread
considerably
but
people
are
now
so
very
cold
with
respect
to
all
things
of
this
kind
that
there
is
little
probability
any
new
religion
or
old
one
that
may
be
revived
will
meet
with
favour
is
it
not
whimsical
enough
that
luther
calvin
and
zuinglius
all
of
them
wretched
authors
should
have
founded
sects
which
are
now
spread
over
a
great
part
of
europe
that
mahomet
though
so
ignorant
should
have
given
a
religion
to
asia
and
africa
and
that
sir
isaac
newton
clark
locke
mr
le
clerc
the
greatest
philosophers
as
well
as
the
ablest
writers
of
their
ages
should
scarcely
have
been
able
to
raise
a
little
flock
which
even
decreases
daily
this
it
is
to
be
born
at
a
proper
period
of
time
were
cardinal
de
retz
to
return
again
into
the
world
neither
his
eloquence
nor
his
intrigues
would
draw
together
ten
women
in
paris
were
oliver
cromwell
he
who
beheaded
his
sovereign
and
seized
upon
the
kingly
dignity
to
rise
from
the
dead
he
would
be
a
wealthy
city
trader
and
no
more
letter
on
the
parliament
the
members
of
the
english
parliament
are
fond
of
comparing
themselves
to
the
old
romans
not
long
since
shippen
opened
a
speech
in
the
house
of
commons
with
these
words
the
majesty
of
the
people
of
england
would
be
wounded
the
singularity
of
the
expression
occasioned
a
loud
laugh
but
this
gentleman
so
far
from
being
disconcerted
repeated
the
same
words
with
a
resolute
tone
of
voice
and
the
laugh
ceased
in
my
opinion
the
majesty
of
the
people
of
england
has
nothing
in
common
with
that
of
the
people
of
rome
much
less
is
there
any
affinity
between
their
governments
there
is
in
london
a
senate
some
of
the
members
whereof
are
accused
doubtless
very
unjustly
of
selling
their
voices
on
certain
occasions
as
was
done
in
rome
this
is
the
only
resemblance
besides
the
two
nations
appear
to
me
quite
opposite
in
character
with
regard
both
to
good
and
evil
the
romans
never
knew
the
dreadful
folly
of
religious
wars
an
abomination
reserved
for
devout
preachers
of
patience
and
humility
marius
and
sylla
caesar
and
pompey
anthony
and
augustus
did
not
draw
their
swords
and
set
the
world
in
a
blaze
merely
to
determine
whether
the
flamen
should
wear
his
shirt
over
his
robe
or
his
robe
over
his
shirt
or
whether
the
sacred
chickens
should
eat
and
drink
or
eat
only
in
order
to
take
the
augury
the
english
have
hanged
one
another
by
law
and
cut
one
another
to
pieces
in
pitched
battles
for
quarrels
of
as
trifling
a
nature
the
sects
of
the
episcopalians
and
presbyterians
quite
distracted
these
very
serious
heads
for
a
time
but
i
fancy
they
will
hardly
ever
be
so
silly
again
they
seeming
to
be
grown
wiser
at
their
own
expense
and
i
do
not
perceive
the
least
inclination
in
them
to
murder
one
another
merely
about
syllogisms
as
some
zealots
among
them
once
did
but
here
follows
a
more
essential
difference
between
rome
and
england
which
gives
the
advantage
entirely
to
the
latter
that
the
civil
wars
of
rome
ended
in
slavery
and
those
of
the
english
in
liberty
the
english
are
the
only
people
upon
earth
who
have
been
able
to
prescribe
limits
to
the
power
of
kings
by
resisting
them
and
who
by
a
series
of
struggles
have
at
last
established
that
wise
government
where
the
prince
is
to
do
good
and
at
the
same
time
is
restrained
from
committing
evil
where
the
nobles
are
great
without
insolence
though
there
are
no
vassals
and
where
the
people
share
in
the
government
without
confusion
the
house
of
lords
and
that
of
the
commons
divide
the
legislative
power
under
the
king
but
the
romans
had
no
such
balance
the
patricians
and
plebeians
in
rome
were
perpetually
at
variance
and
there
was
no
intermediate
power
to
reconcile
them
the
roman
senate
who
were
so
unjustly
so
criminally
proud
as
not
to
suffer
the
plebeians
to
share
with
them
in
anything
could
find
no
other
artifice
to
keep
the
latter
out
of
the
administration
than
by
employing
them
in
foreign
wars
they
considered
the
plebeians
as
a
wild
beast
whom
it
behoved
them
to
let
loose
upon
their
neighbours
for
fear
they
should
devour
their
masters
thus
the
greatest
defect
in
the
government
of
the
romans
raised
them
to
be
conquerors
by
being
unhappy
at
home
they
triumphed
over
and
possessed
themselves
of
the
world
till
at
last
their
divisions
sunk
them
to
slavery
the
government
of
england
will
never
rise
to
so
exalted
a
pitch
of
glory
nor
will
its
end
be
so
fatal
the
english
are
not
fired
with
the
splendid
folly
of
making
conquests
but
would
only
prevent
their
neighbours
from
conquering
they
are
not
only
jealous
of
their
own
liberty
but
even
of
that
of
other
nations
the
english
were
exasperated
against
louis
xiv
for
no
other
reason
but
because
he
was
ambitious
and
declared
war
against
him
merely
out
of
levity
not
from
any
interested
motives
the
english
have
doubtless
purchased
their
liberties
at
a
very
high
price
and
waded
through
seas
of
blood
to
drown
the
idol
of
arbitrary
power
other
nations
have
been
involved
in
as
great
calamities
and
have
shed
as
much
blood
but
then
the
blood
they
spilt
in
defence
of
their
liberties
only
enslaved
them
the
more
that
which
rises
to
a
revolution
in
england
is
no
more
than
a
sedition
in
other
countries
a
city
in
spain
in
barbary
or
in
turkey
takes
up
arms
in
defence
of
its
privileges
when
immediately
it
is
stormed
by
mercenary
troops
it
is
punished
by
executioners
and
the
rest
of
the
nation
kiss
the
chains
they
are
loaded
with
the
french
are
of
opinion
that
the
government
of
this
island
is
more
tempestuous
than
the
sea
which
surrounds
it
which
indeed
is
true
but
then
it
is
never
so
but
when
the
king
raises
the
storm
when
he
attempts
to
seize
the
ship
of
which
he
is
only
the
chief
pilot
the
civil
wars
of
france
lasted
longer
were
more
cruel
and
productive
of
greater
evils
than
those
of
england
but
none
of
these
civil
wars
had
a
wise
and
prudent
liberty
for
their
object
in
the
detestable
reigns
of
charles
ix
and
henry
iii
the
whole
affair
was
only
whether
the
people
should
be
slaves
to
the
guises
with
regard
to
the
last
war
of
paris
it
deserves
only
to
be
hooted
at
methinks
i
see
a
crowd
of
schoolboys
rising
up
in
arms
against
their
master
and
afterwards
whipped
for
it
cardinal
de
retz
who
was
witty
and
brave
but
to
no
purpose
rebellious
without
a
cause
factious
without
design
and
head
of
a
defenceless
party
caballed
for
caballing
sake
and
seemed
to
foment
the
civil
war
merely
out
of
diversion
the
parliament
did
not
know
what
he
intended
nor
what
he
did
not
intend
he
levied
troops
by
act
of
parliament
and
the
next
moment
cashiered
them
he
threatened
he
begged
pardon
he
set
a
price
upon
cardinal
mazarin
head
and
afterwards
congratulated
him
in
a
public
manner
our
civil
wars
under
charles
vi
were
bloody
and
cruel
those
of
the
league
execrable
and
that
of
the
frondeurs
ridiculous
that
for
which
the
french
chiefly
reproach
the
english
nation
is
the
murder
of
king
charles
whom
his
subjects
treated
exactly
as
he
would
have
treated
them
had
his
reign
been
prosperous
after
all
consider
on
one
side
charles
defeated
in
a
pitched
battle
imprisoned
tried
sentenced
to
die
in
westminster
hall
and
then
beheaded
and
on
the
other
the
emperor
henry
poisoned
by
his
chaplain
at
his
receiving
the
sacrament
henry
iii
stabbed
by
a
monk
thirty
assassinations
projected
against
henry
several
of
them
put
in
execution
and
the
last
bereaving
that
great
monarch
of
his
life
weigh
i
say
all
these
wicked
attempts
and
then
judge
letter
on
the
government
that
mixture
in
the
english
government
that
harmony
between
king
lords
and
commons
did
not
always
subsist
england
was
enslaved
for
a
long
series
of
years
by
the
romans
the
saxons
the
danes
and
the
french
successively
william
the
conqueror
particularly
ruled
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
he
disposed
as
absolutely
of
the
lives
and
fortunes
of
his
conquered
subjects
as
an
eastern
monarch
and
forbade
upon
pain
of
death
the
english
either
fire
or
candle
in
their
houses
after
eight
whether
was
this
to
prevent
their
nocturnal
meetings
or
only
to
try
by
an
odd
and
whimsical
prohibition
how
far
it
was
possible
for
one
man
to
extend
his
power
over
his
it
is
true
indeed
that
the
english
had
parliaments
before
and
after
william
the
conqueror
and
they
boast
of
them
as
though
these
assemblies
then
called
parliaments
composed
of
ecclesiastical
tyrants
and
of
plunderers
entitled
barons
had
been
the
guardians
of
the
public
liberty
and
happiness
the
barbarians
who
came
from
the
shores
of
the
baltic
and
settled
in
the
rest
of
europe
brought
with
them
the
form
of
government
called
states
or
parliaments
about
which
so
much
noise
is
made
and
which
are
so
little
understood
kings
indeed
were
not
absolute
in
those
days
but
then
the
people
were
more
wretched
upon
that
very
account
and
more
completely
enslaved
the
chiefs
of
these
savages
who
had
laid
waste
france
italy
spain
and
england
made
themselves
monarchs
their
generals
divided
among
themselves
the
several
countries
they
had
conquered
whence
sprung
those
margraves
those
peers
those
barons
those
petty
tyrants
who
often
contested
with
their
sovereigns
for
the
spoils
of
whole
nations
these
were
birds
of
prey
fighting
with
an
eagle
for
doves
whose
blood
the
victorious
was
to
suck
every
nation
instead
of
being
governed
by
one
master
was
trampled
upon
by
a
hundred
tyrants
the
priests
soon
played
a
part
among
them
before
this
it
had
been
the
fate
of
the
gauls
the
germans
and
the
britons
to
be
always
governed
by
their
druids
and
the
chiefs
of
their
villages
an
ancient
kind
of
barons
not
so
tyrannical
as
their
successors
these
druids
pretended
to
be
mediators
between
god
and
man
they
enacted
laws
they
fulminated
their
excommunications
and
sentenced
to
death
the
bishops
succeeded
by
insensible
degrees
to
their
temporal
authority
in
the
goth
and
vandal
government
the
popes
set
themselves
at
their
head
and
armed
with
their
briefs
their
bulls
and
reinforced
by
monks
they
made
even
kings
tremble
deposed
and
assassinated
them
at
pleasure
and
employed
every
artifice
to
draw
into
their
own
purses
moneys
from
all
parts
of
europe
the
weak
ina
one
of
the
tyrants
of
the
saxon
heptarchy
in
england
was
the
first
monarch
who
submitted
in
his
pilgrimage
to
rome
to
pay
peter
penny
equivalent
very
near
to
a
french
crown
for
every
house
in
his
dominions
the
whole
island
soon
followed
his
example
england
became
insensibly
one
of
the
pope
provinces
and
the
holy
father
used
to
send
from
time
to
time
his
legates
thither
to
levy
exorbitant
taxes
at
last
king
john
delivered
up
by
a
public
instrument
the
kingdom
of
england
to
the
pope
who
had
excommunicated
him
but
the
barons
not
finding
their
account
in
this
resignation
dethroned
the
wretched
king
john
and
seated
louis
father
to
louis
king
of
france
in
his
place
however
they
were
soon
weary
of
their
new
monarch
and
accordingly
obliged
him
to
return
to
france
whilst
that
the
barons
the
bishops
and
the
popes
all
laid
waste
england
where
all
were
for
ruling
the
most
numerous
the
most
useful
even
the
most
virtuous
and
consequently
the
most
venerable
part
of
mankind
consisting
of
those
who
study
the
laws
and
the
sciences
of
traders
of
artificers
in
a
word
of
all
who
were
not
tyrants
that
is
those
who
are
called
the
people
these
i
say
were
by
them
looked
upon
as
so
many
animals
beneath
the
dignity
of
the
human
species
the
commons
in
those
ages
were
far
from
sharing
in
the
government
they
being
villains
or
peasants
whose
labour
whose
blood
were
the
property
of
their
masters
who
entitled
themselves
the
nobility
the
major
part
of
men
in
europe
were
at
that
time
what
they
are
to
this
day
in
several
parts
of
the
world
they
were
villains
or
bondsmen
of
lords
that
is
a
kind
of
cattle
bought
and
sold
with
the
land
many
ages
passed
away
before
justice
could
be
done
to
human
nature
before
mankind
were
conscious
that
it
was
abominable
for
many
to
sow
and
but
few
reap
and
was
not
france
very
happy
when
the
power
and
authority
of
those
petty
robbers
was
abolished
by
the
lawful
authority
of
kings
and
of
the
people
happily
in
the
violent
shocks
which
the
divisions
between
kings
and
the
nobles
gave
to
empires
the
chains
of
nations
were
more
or
less
heavy
liberty
in
england
sprang
from
the
quarrels
of
tyrants
the
barons
forced
king
john
and
king
henry
iii
to
grant
the
famous
magna
charta
the
chief
design
of
which
was
indeed
to
make
kings
dependent
on
the
lords
but
then
the
rest
of
the
nation
were
a
little
favoured
in
it
in
order
that
they
might
join
on
proper
occasions
with
their
pretended
masters
this
great
charter
which
is
considered
as
the
sacred
origin
of
the
english
liberties
shows
in
itself
how
little
liberty
was
known
the
title
alone
proves
that
the
king
thought
he
had
a
just
right
to
be
absolute
and
that
the
barons
and
even
the
clergy
forced
him
to
give
up
the
pretended
right
for
no
other
reason
but
because
they
were
the
most
powerful
magna
charta
begins
in
this
style
we
grant
of
our
own
free
will
the
following
privileges
to
the
archbishops
bishops
priors
and
barons
of
our
kingdom
etc
the
house
of
commons
is
not
once
mentioned
in
the
articles
of
this
charter
a
proof
that
it
did
not
yet
exist
or
that
it
existed
without
power
mention
is
therein
made
by
name
of
the
freemen
of
england
a
melancholy
proof
that
some
were
not
so
it
appears
by
article
that
these
pretended
freemen
owed
service
to
their
lords
such
a
liberty
as
this
was
not
many
removes
from
slavery
by
article
the
king
ordains
that
his
officers
shall
not
henceforward
seize
upon
unless
they
pay
for
them
the
horses
and
carts
of
freemen
the
people
considered
this
ordinance
as
a
real
liberty
though
it
was
a
greater
tyranny
henry
that
happy
usurper
and
great
politician
who
pretended
to
love
the
barons
though
he
in
reality
hated
and
feared
them
got
their
lands
alienated
by
this
means
the
villains
afterwards
acquiring
riches
by
their
industry
purchased
the
estates
and
country
seats
of
the
illustrious
peers
who
had
ruined
themselves
by
their
folly
and
extravagance
and
all
the
lands
got
by
insensible
degrees
into
other
hands
the
power
of
the
house
of
commons
increased
every
day
the
families
of
the
ancient
peers
were
at
last
extinct
and
as
peers
only
are
properly
noble
in
england
there
would
be
no
such
thing
in
strictness
of
law
as
nobility
in
that
island
had
not
the
kings
created
new
barons
from
time
to
time
and
preserved
the
body
of
peers
once
a
terror
to
them
to
oppose
them
to
the
commons
since
become
so
formidable
all
these
new
peers
who
compose
the
higher
house
receive
nothing
but
their
titles
from
the
king
and
very
few
of
them
have
estates
in
those
places
whence
they
take
their
titles
one
shall
be
duke
of
though
he
has
not
a
foot
of
land
in
dorsetshire
and
another
is
earl
of
a
village
though
he
scarce
knows
where
it
is
situated
the
peers
have
power
but
it
is
only
in
the
parliament
house
there
is
no
such
thing
here
as
and
that
is
a
power
to
judge
in
all
matters
civil
and
criminal
nor
a
right
or
privilege
of
hunting
in
the
grounds
of
a
citizen
who
at
the
same
time
is
not
permitted
to
fire
a
gun
in
his
own
field
no
one
is
exempted
in
this
country
from
paying
certain
taxes
because
he
is
a
nobleman
or
a
priest
all
duties
and
taxes
are
settled
by
the
house
of
commons
whose
power
is
greater
than
that
of
the
peers
though
inferior
to
it
in
dignity
the
spiritual
as
well
as
temporal
lords
have
the
liberty
to
reject
a
money
bill
brought
in
by
the
commons
but
they
are
not
allowed
to
alter
anything
in
it
and
must
either
pass
or
throw
it
out
without
restriction
when
the
bill
has
passed
the
lords
and
is
signed
by
the
king
then
the
whole
nation
pays
every
man
in
proportion
to
his
revenue
or
estate
not
according
to
his
title
which
would
be
absurd
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
arbitrary
subsidy
or
but
a
real
tax
on
the
lands
of
all
which
an
estimate
was
made
in
the
reign
of
the
famous
king
william
iii
the
continues
still
upon
the
same
foot
though
the
revenue
of
the
lands
is
increased
thus
no
one
is
tyrannised
over
and
every
one
is
easy
the
feet
of
the
peasants
are
not
bruised
by
wooden
shoes
they
eat
white
bread
are
well
clothed
and
are
not
afraid
of
increasing
their
stock
of
cattle
nor
of
tiling
their
houses
from
any
apprehension
that
their
taxes
will
be
raised
the
year
following
the
annual
income
of
the
estates
of
a
great
many
commoners
in
england
amounts
to
two
hundred
thousand
livres
and
yet
these
do
not
think
it
beneath
them
to
plough
the
lands
which
enrich
them
and
on
which
they
enjoy
their
liberty
letter
on
trade
as
trade
enriched
the
citizens
in
england
so
it
contributed
to
their
freedom
and
this
freedom
on
the
other
side
extended
their
commerce
whence
arose
the
grandeur
of
the
state
trade
raised
by
insensible
degrees
the
naval
power
which
gives
the
english
a
superiority
over
the
seas
and
they
now
are
masters
of
very
near
two
hundred
ships
of
war
posterity
will
very
probably
be
surprised
to
hear
that
an
island
whose
only
produce
is
a
little
lead
tin
and
coarse
wool
should
become
so
powerful
by
its
commerce
as
to
be
able
to
send
in
three
fleets
at
the
same
time
to
three
different
and
far
distanced
parts
of
the
globe
one
before
gibraltar
conquered
and
still
possessed
by
the
english
a
second
to
portobello
to
dispossess
the
king
of
spain
of
the
treasures
of
the
west
indies
and
a
third
into
the
baltic
to
prevent
the
northern
powers
from
coming
to
an
engagement
at
the
time
when
louis
xiv
made
all
italy
tremble
and
that
his
armies
which
had
already
possessed
themselves
of
savoy
and
piedmont
were
upon
the
point
of
taking
turin
prince
eugene
was
obliged
to
march
from
the
middle
of
germany
in
order
to
succour
savoy
having
no
money
without
which
cities
can
not
be
either
taken
or
defended
he
addressed
himself
to
some
english
merchants
these
at
an
hour
and
half
warning
lent
him
five
millions
whereby
he
was
enabled
to
deliver
turin
and
to
beat
the
french
after
which
he
wrote
the
following
short
letter
to
the
persons
who
had
disbursed
him
the
sums
gentlemen
i
have
received
your
money
and
flatter
myself
that
i
have
laid
it
out
to
your
satisfaction
such
a
circumstance
as
this
raises
a
just
pride
in
an
english
merchant
and
makes
him
presume
not
without
some
reason
to
compare
himself
to
a
roman
citizen
and
indeed
a
peer
brother
does
not
think
traffic
beneath
him
when
the
lord
townshend
was
minister
of
state
a
brother
of
his
was
content
to
be
a
city
merchant
and
at
the
time
that
the
earl
of
oxford
governed
great
britain
a
younger
brother
was
no
more
than
a
factor
in
aleppo
where
he
chose
to
live
and
where
he
died
this
custom
which
begins
however
to
be
laid
aside
appears
monstrous
to
germans
vainly
puffed
up
with
their
extraction
these
think
it
morally
impossible
that
the
son
of
an
english
peer
should
be
no
more
than
a
rich
and
powerful
citizen
for
all
are
princes
in
germany
there
have
been
thirty
highnesses
of
the
same
name
all
whose
patrimony
consisted
only
in
their
escutcheons
and
their
pride
in
france
the
title
of
marquis
is
given
gratis
to
any
one
who
will
accept
of
it
and
whosoever
arrives
at
paris
from
the
midst
of
the
most
remote
provinces
with
money
in
his
purse
and
a
name
terminating
in
or
may
strut
about
and
cry
such
a
man
as
i
a
man
of
my
rank
and
figure
and
may
look
down
upon
a
trader
with
sovereign
contempt
whilst
the
trader
on
the
other
side
by
thus
often
hearing
his
profession
treated
so
disdainfully
is
fool
enough
to
blush
at
it
however
i
need
not
say
which
is
most
useful
to
a
nation
a
lord
powdered
in
the
tip
of
the
mode
who
knows
exactly
at
what
the
king
rises
and
goes
to
bed
and
who
gives
himself
airs
of
grandeur
and
state
at
the
same
time
that
he
is
acting
the
slave
in
the
of
a
prime
minister
or
a
merchant
who
enriches
his
country
despatches
orders
from
his
house
to
surat
and
grand
cairo
and
contributes
to
the
of
the
world
letter
on
inoculation
it
is
inadvertently
affirmed
in
the
christian
countries
of
europe
that
the
english
are
fools
and
madmen
fools
because
they
give
their
children
the
to
prevent
their
catching
it
and
madmen
because
they
wantonly
communicate
a
certain
and
dreadful
distemper
to
their
children
merely
to
prevent
an
uncertain
evil
the
english
on
the
other
side
call
the
rest
of
the
europeans
cowardly
and
unnatural
cowardly
because
they
are
afraid
of
putting
their
children
to
a
little
pain
unnatural
because
they
expose
them
to
die
one
time
or
other
of
the
pox
but
that
the
reader
may
be
able
to
judge
whether
the
english
or
those
who
differ
from
them
in
opinion
are
in
the
right
here
follows
the
history
of
the
famed
inoculation
which
is
mentioned
with
so
much
dread
in
france
the
circassian
women
have
from
time
immemorial
communicated
the
pox
to
their
children
when
not
above
six
months
old
by
making
an
incision
in
the
arm
and
by
putting
into
this
incision
a
pustule
taken
carefully
from
the
body
of
another
child
this
pustule
produces
the
same
effect
in
the
arm
it
is
laid
in
as
yeast
in
a
piece
of
dough
it
ferments
and
diffuses
through
the
whole
mass
of
blood
the
qualities
with
which
it
is
impregnated
the
pustules
of
the
child
in
whom
the
artificial
has
been
thus
inoculated
are
employed
to
communicate
the
same
distemper
to
others
there
is
an
almost
perpetual
circulation
of
it
in
circassia
and
when
unhappily
the
has
quite
left
the
country
the
inhabitants
of
it
are
in
as
great
trouble
and
perplexity
as
other
nations
when
their
harvest
has
fallen
short
the
circumstance
that
introduced
a
custom
in
circassia
which
appears
so
singular
to
others
is
nevertheless
a
cause
common
to
all
nations
i
mean
maternal
tenderness
and
interest
the
circassians
are
poor
and
their
daughters
are
beautiful
and
indeed
it
is
in
them
they
chiefly
trade
they
furnish
with
beauties
the
seraglios
of
the
turkish
sultan
of
the
persian
sophy
and
of
all
those
who
are
wealthy
enough
to
purchase
and
maintain
such
precious
merchandise
these
maidens
are
very
honourably
and
virtuously
instructed
to
fondle
and
caress
men
are
taught
dances
of
a
very
polite
and
effeminate
kind
and
how
to
heighten
by
the
most
voluptuous
artifices
the
pleasures
of
their
disdainful
masters
for
whom
they
are
designed
these
unhappy
creatures
repeat
their
lesson
to
their
mothers
in
the
same
manner
as
little
girls
among
us
repeat
their
catechism
without
understanding
one
word
they
say
now
it
often
happened
that
after
a
father
and
mother
had
taken
the
utmost
care
of
the
education
of
their
children
they
were
frustrated
of
all
their
hopes
in
an
instant
the
getting
into
the
family
one
daughter
died
of
it
another
lost
an
eye
a
third
had
a
great
nose
at
her
recovery
and
the
unhappy
parents
were
completely
ruined
even
frequently
when
the
became
epidemical
trade
was
suspended
for
several
years
which
thinned
very
considerably
the
seraglios
of
persia
and
turkey
a
trading
nation
is
always
watchful
over
its
own
interests
and
grasps
at
every
discovery
that
may
be
of
advantage
to
its
commerce
the
circassians
observed
that
scarce
one
person
in
a
thousand
was
ever
attacked
by
a
of
a
violent
kind
that
some
indeed
had
this
distemper
very
favourably
three
or
four
times
but
never
twice
so
as
to
prove
fatal
in
a
word
that
no
one
ever
had
it
in
a
violent
degree
twice
in
his
life
they
observed
farther
that
when
the
is
of
the
milder
sort
and
the
pustules
have
only
a
tender
delicate
skin
to
break
through
they
never
leave
the
least
scar
in
the
face
from
these
natural
observations
they
concluded
that
in
case
an
infant
of
six
months
or
a
year
old
should
have
a
milder
sort
of
he
would
not
die
of
it
would
not
be
marked
nor
be
ever
afflicted
with
it
again
in
order
therefore
to
preserve
the
life
and
beauty
of
their
children
the
only
thing
remaining
was
to
give
them
the
in
their
infant
years
this
they
did
by
inoculating
in
the
body
of
a
child
a
pustule
taken
from
the
most
regular
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
favourable
sort
of
that
could
be
procured
the
experiment
could
not
possibly
fail
the
turks
who
are
people
of
good
sense
soon
adopted
this
custom
insomuch
that
at
this
time
there
is
not
a
bassa
in
constantinople
but
communicates
the
to
his
children
of
both
sexes
immediately
upon
their
being
weaned
some
pretend
that
the
circassians
borrowed
this
custom
anciently
from
the
arabians
but
we
shall
leave
the
clearing
up
of
this
point
of
history
to
some
learned
benedictine
who
will
not
fail
to
compile
a
great
many
folios
on
this
subject
with
the
several
proofs
or
authorities
all
i
have
to
say
upon
it
is
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
king
george
the
lady
wortley
montague
a
woman
of
as
fine
a
genius
and
endued
with
as
great
a
strength
of
mind
as
any
of
her
sex
in
the
british
kingdoms
being
with
her
husband
who
was
ambassador
at
the
porte
made
no
scruple
to
communicate
the
to
an
infant
of
which
she
was
delivered
in
constantinople
the
chaplain
represented
to
his
lady
but
to
no
purpose
that
this
was
an
unchristian
operation
and
therefore
that
it
could
succeed
with
none
but
infidels
however
it
had
the
most
happy
effect
upon
the
son
of
the
lady
wortley
montague
who
at
her
return
to
england
communicated
the
experiment
to
the
princess
of
wales
now
queen
of
england
it
must
be
confessed
that
this
princess
abstracted
from
her
crown
and
titles
was
born
to
encourage
the
whole
circle
of
arts
and
to
do
good
to
mankind
she
appears
as
an
amiable
philosopher
on
the
throne
having
never
let
slip
one
opportunity
of
improving
the
great
talents
she
received
from
nature
nor
of
exerting
her
beneficence
it
is
she
who
being
informed
that
a
daughter
of
milton
was
living
but
in
miserable
circumstances
immediately
sent
her
a
considerable
present
it
is
she
who
protects
the
learned
father
courayer
it
is
she
who
condescended
to
attempt
a
reconciliation
between
clark
and
leibnitz
the
moment
this
princess
heard
of
inoculation
she
caused
an
experiment
of
it
to
be
made
on
four
criminals
sentenced
to
die
and
by
that
means
preserved
their
lives
doubly
for
she
not
only
saved
them
from
the
gallows
but
by
means
of
this
artificial
prevented
their
ever
having
that
distemper
in
a
natural
way
with
which
they
would
very
probably
have
been
attacked
one
time
or
other
and
might
have
died
of
in
a
more
advanced
age
the
princess
being
assured
of
the
usefulness
of
this
operation
caused
her
own
children
to
be
inoculated
a
great
part
of
the
kingdom
followed
her
example
and
since
that
time
ten
thousand
children
at
least
of
persons
of
condition
owe
in
this
manner
their
lives
to
her
majesty
and
to
the
lady
wortley
montague
and
as
many
of
the
fair
sex
are
obliged
to
them
for
their
beauty
upon
a
general
calculation
threescore
persons
in
every
hundred
have
the
of
these
threescore
twenty
die
of
it
in
the
most
favourable
season
of
life
and
as
many
more
wear
the
disagreeable
remains
of
it
in
their
faces
so
long
as
they
live
thus
a
fifth
part
of
mankind
either
die
or
are
disfigured
by
this
distemper
but
it
does
not
prove
fatal
to
so
much
as
one
among
those
who
are
inoculated
in
turkey
or
in
england
unless
the
patient
be
infirm
or
would
have
died
had
not
the
experiment
been
made
upon
him
besides
no
one
is
disfigured
no
one
has
the
pox
a
second
time
if
the
inoculation
was
perfect
it
is
therefore
certain
that
had
the
lady
of
some
french
ambassador
brought
this
secret
from
constantinople
to
paris
the
nation
would
have
been
for
ever
obliged
to
her
then
the
duke
de
villequier
father
to
the
duke
who
enjoys
the
most
vigorous
constitution
and
is
the
healthiest
man
in
france
would
not
have
been
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
his
age
the
prince
of
soubise
happy
in
the
finest
flush
of
health
would
not
have
been
snatched
away
at
nor
the
dauphin
grandfather
to
louis
have
been
laid
in
his
grave
in
his
fiftieth
year
twenty
thousand
persons
whom
the
swept
away
at
paris
in
would
have
been
alive
at
this
time
but
are
not
the
french
fond
of
life
and
is
beauty
so
inconsiderable
an
advantage
as
to
be
disregarded
by
the
ladies
it
must
be
confessed
that
we
are
an
odd
kind
of
people
perhaps
our
nation
will
imitate
ten
years
hence
this
practice
of
the
english
if
the
clergy
and
the
physicians
will
but
give
them
leave
to
do
it
or
possibly
our
countrymen
may
introduce
inoculation
three
months
hence
in
france
out
of
mere
whim
in
case
the
english
should
discontinue
it
through
fickleness
i
am
informed
that
the
chinese
have
practised
inoculation
these
hundred
years
a
circumstance
that
argues
very
much
in
its
favour
since
they
are
thought
to
be
the
wisest
and
best
governed
people
in
the
world
the
chinese
indeed
do
not
communicate
this
distemper
by
inoculation
but
at
the
nose
in
the
same
manner
as
we
take
snuff
this
is
a
more
agreeable
way
but
then
it
produces
the
like
effects
and
proves
at
the
same
time
that
had
inoculation
been
practised
in
france
it
would
have
saved
the
lives
of
thousands
letter
on
the
lord
bacon
not
long
since
the
trite
and
frivolous
question
following
was
debated
in
a
very
polite
and
learned
company
who
was
the
greatest
man
caesar
alexander
tamerlane
cromwell
somebody
answered
that
sir
isaac
newton
excelled
them
all
the
gentleman
assertion
was
very
just
for
if
true
greatness
consists
in
having
received
from
heaven
a
mighty
genius
and
in
having
employed
it
to
enlighten
our
own
mind
and
that
of
others
a
man
like
sir
isaac
newton
whose
equal
is
hardly
found
in
a
thousand
years
is
the
truly
great
man
and
those
politicians
and
conquerors
and
all
ages
produce
some
were
generally
so
many
illustrious
wicked
men
that
man
claims
our
respect
who
commands
over
the
minds
of
the
rest
of
the
world
by
the
force
of
truth
not
those
who
enslave
their
he
who
is
acquainted
with
the
universe
not
they
who
deface
it
since
therefore
you
desire
me
to
give
you
an
account
of
the
famous
personages
whom
england
has
given
birth
to
i
shall
begin
with
lord
bacon
locke
sir
isaac
newton
afterwards
the
warriors
and
ministers
of
state
shall
come
in
their
order
i
must
begin
with
the
celebrated
viscount
verulam
known
in
europe
by
the
name
of
bacon
which
was
that
of
his
family
his
father
had
been
lord
keeper
and
himself
was
a
great
many
years
lord
chancellor
under
king
james
i
nevertheless
amidst
the
intrigues
of
a
court
and
the
affairs
of
his
exalted
employment
which
alone
were
enough
to
engross
his
whole
time
he
yet
found
so
much
leisure
for
study
as
to
make
himself
a
great
philosopher
a
good
historian
and
an
elegant
writer
and
a
still
more
surprising
circumstance
is
that
he
lived
in
an
age
in
which
the
art
of
writing
justly
and
elegantly
was
little
known
much
less
true
philosophy
lord
bacon
as
is
the
fate
of
man
was
more
esteemed
after
his
death
than
in
his
lifetime
his
enemies
were
in
the
british
court
and
his
admirers
were
foreigners
when
the
marquis
attended
in
england
upon
the
princess
henrietta
maria
daughter
to
henry
whom
king
charles
had
married
that
minister
went
and
visited
the
lord
bacon
who
being
at
that
time
sick
in
his
bed
received
him
with
the
curtains
shut
close
you
resemble
the
angels
says
the
marquis
to
him
we
hear
those
beings
spoken
of
perpetually
and
we
believe
them
superior
to
men
but
are
never
allowed
the
consolation
to
see
them
you
know
that
this
great
man
was
accused
of
a
crime
very
unbecoming
a
philosopher
i
mean
bribery
and
extortion
you
know
that
he
was
sentenced
by
the
house
of
lords
to
pay
a
fine
of
about
four
hundred
thousand
french
livres
to
lose
his
peerage
and
his
dignity
of
chancellor
but
in
the
present
age
the
english
revere
his
memory
to
such
a
degree
that
they
will
scarce
allow
him
to
have
been
guilty
in
case
you
should
ask
what
are
my
thoughts
on
this
head
i
shall
answer
you
in
the
words
which
i
heard
the
lord
bolingbroke
use
on
another
occasion
several
gentlemen
were
speaking
in
his
company
of
the
avarice
with
which
the
late
duke
of
marlborough
had
been
charged
some
examples
whereof
being
given
the
lord
bolingbroke
was
appealed
to
who
having
been
in
the
opposite
party
might
perhaps
without
the
imputation
of
indecency
have
been
allowed
to
clear
up
that
matter
he
was
so
great
a
man
replied
his
lordship
that
i
have
forgot
his
vices
i
shall
therefore
confine
myself
to
those
things
which
so
justly
gained
lord
bacon
the
esteem
of
all
europe
the
most
singular
and
the
best
of
all
his
pieces
is
that
which
at
this
time
is
the
most
useless
and
the
least
read
i
mean
his
scientiarum
this
is
the
scaffold
with
which
the
new
philosophy
was
raised
and
when
the
edifice
was
built
part
of
it
at
least
the
scaffold
was
no
longer
of
service
the
lord
bacon
was
not
yet
acquainted
with
nature
but
then
he
knew
and
pointed
out
the
several
paths
that
lead
to
it
he
had
despised
in
his
younger
years
the
thing
called
philosophy
in
the
universities
and
did
all
that
lay
in
his
power
to
prevent
those
societies
of
men
instituted
to
improve
human
reason
from
depraving
it
by
their
quiddities
their
horrors
of
the
vacuum
their
substantial
forms
and
all
those
impertinent
terms
which
not
only
ignorance
had
rendered
venerable
but
which
had
been
made
sacred
by
their
being
ridiculously
blended
with
religion
he
is
the
father
of
experimental
philosophy
it
must
indeed
be
confessed
that
very
surprising
secrets
had
been
found
out
before
his
time
the
printing
engraving
on
copper
plates
the
art
of
restoring
in
some
measure
old
men
to
their
sight
by
spectacles
gunpowder
had
been
discovered
a
new
world
had
been
fought
for
found
and
conquered
would
not
one
suppose
that
these
sublime
discoveries
had
been
made
by
the
greatest
philosophers
and
in
ages
much
more
enlightened
than
the
present
but
it
was
far
otherwise
all
these
great
changes
happened
in
the
most
stupid
and
barbarous
times
chance
only
gave
birth
to
most
of
those
inventions
and
it
is
very
probable
that
what
is
called
chance
contributed
very
much
to
the
discovery
of
america
at
least
it
has
been
always
thought
that
christopher
columbus
undertook
his
voyage
merely
on
the
relation
of
a
captain
of
a
ship
which
a
storm
had
driven
as
far
westward
as
the
caribbean
islands
be
this
as
it
will
men
had
sailed
round
the
world
and
could
destroy
cities
by
an
artificial
thunder
more
dreadful
than
the
real
one
but
then
they
were
not
acquainted
with
the
circulation
of
the
blood
the
weight
of
the
air
the
laws
of
motion
light
the
number
of
our
planets
and
a
man
who
maintained
a
thesis
on
categories
on
the
universals
parte
or
nonsense
was
looked
upon
as
a
prodigy
the
most
astonishing
the
most
useful
inventions
are
not
those
which
reflect
the
greatest
honour
on
the
human
mind
it
is
to
a
mechanical
instinct
which
is
found
in
many
men
and
not
to
true
philosophy
that
most
arts
owe
their
origin
the
discovery
of
fire
the
art
of
making
bread
of
melting
and
preparing
metals
of
building
houses
and
the
invention
of
the
shuttle
are
infinitely
more
beneficial
to
mankind
than
printing
or
the
and
yet
these
arts
were
invented
by
uncultivated
savage
men
what
a
prodigious
use
the
greeks
and
romans
made
afterwards
of
mechanics
nevertheless
they
believed
that
there
were
crystal
heavens
that
the
stars
were
small
lamps
which
sometimes
fell
into
the
sea
and
one
of
their
greatest
philosophers
after
long
researches
found
that
the
stars
were
so
many
flints
which
had
been
detached
from
the
earth
in
a
word
no
one
before
the
lord
bacon
was
acquainted
with
experimental
philosophy
nor
with
the
several
physical
experiments
which
have
been
made
since
his
time
scarce
one
of
them
but
is
hinted
at
in
his
work
and
he
himself
had
made
several
he
made
a
kind
of
pneumatic
engine
by
which
he
guessed
the
elasticity
of
the
air
he
approached
on
all
sides
as
it
were
to
the
discovery
of
its
weight
and
had
very
near
attained
it
but
some
time
after
torricelli
seized
upon
this
truth
in
a
little
time
experimental
philosophy
began
to
be
cultivated
on
a
sudden
in
most
parts
of
europe
it
was
a
hidden
treasure
which
the
lord
bacon
had
some
notion
of
and
which
all
the
philosophers
encouraged
by
his
promises
endeavoured
to
dig
up
but
that
which
surprised
me
most
was
to
read
in
his
work
in
express
terms
the
new
attraction
the
invention
of
which
is
ascribed
to
sir
isaac
newton
we
must
search
says
lord
bacon
whether
there
may
not
be
a
kind
of
magnetic
power
which
operates
between
the
earth
and
heavy
bodies
between
the
moon
and
the
ocean
between
the
planets
in
another
place
he
says
either
heavy
bodies
must
be
carried
towards
the
centre
of
the
earth
or
must
be
reciprocally
attracted
by
it
and
in
the
latter
case
it
is
evident
that
the
nearer
bodies
in
their
falling
draw
towards
the
earth
the
stronger
they
will
attract
one
another
we
must
says
he
make
an
experiment
to
see
whether
the
same
clock
will
go
faster
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
or
at
the
bottom
of
a
mine
whether
the
strength
of
the
weights
decreases
on
the
mountain
and
increases
in
the
mine
it
is
probable
that
the
earth
has
a
true
attractive
power
this
forerunner
in
philosophy
was
also
an
elegant
writer
an
historian
and
a
wit
his
moral
essays
are
greatly
esteemed
but
they
were
drawn
up
in
the
view
of
instructing
rather
than
of
pleasing
and
as
they
are
not
a
satire
upon
mankind
like
rochefoucauld
maxims
nor
written
upon
a
sceptical
plan
like
montaigne
essays
they
are
not
so
much
read
as
those
two
ingenious
authors
his
history
of
henry
vii
was
looked
upon
as
a
masterpiece
but
how
is
it
possible
that
some
persons
can
presume
to
compare
so
little
a
work
with
the
history
of
our
illustrious
thuanus
speaking
about
the
famous
impostor
perkin
son
to
a
converted
jew
who
assumed
boldly
the
name
and
title
of
richard
king
of
england
at
the
instigation
of
the
duchess
of
burgundy
and
who
disputed
the
crown
with
henry
the
lord
bacon
writes
as
follows
at
this
time
the
king
began
again
to
be
haunted
with
sprites
by
the
magic
and
curious
arts
of
the
lady
margaret
who
raised
up
the
ghost
of
richard
duke
of
york
second
son
to
king
edward
to
walk
and
vex
the
king
after
such
time
as
she
margaret
of
burgundy
thought
he
perkin
warbeck
was
perfect
in
his
lesson
she
began
to
cast
with
herself
from
what
coast
this
blazing
star
should
first
appear
and
at
what
time
it
must
be
upon
the
horizon
of
ireland
for
there
had
the
like
meteor
strong
influence
before
methinks
our
sagacious
thuanus
does
not
give
in
to
such
fustian
which
formerly
was
looked
upon
as
sublime
but
in
this
age
is
justly
called
nonsense
letter
on
locke
perhaps
no
man
ever
had
a
more
judicious
or
more
methodical
genius
or
was
a
more
acute
logician
than
locke
and
yet
he
was
not
deeply
skilled
in
the
mathematics
this
great
man
could
never
subject
himself
to
the
tedious
fatigue
of
calculations
nor
to
the
dry
pursuit
of
mathematical
truths
which
do
not
at
first
present
any
sensible
objects
to
the
mind
and
no
one
has
given
better
proofs
than
he
that
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
have
a
geometrical
head
without
the
assistance
of
geometry
before
his
time
several
great
philosophers
had
declared
in
the
most
positive
terms
what
the
soul
of
man
is
but
as
these
absolutely
knew
nothing
about
it
they
might
very
well
be
allowed
to
differ
entirely
in
opinion
from
one
another
in
greece
the
infant
seat
of
arts
and
of
errors
and
where
the
grandeur
as
well
as
folly
of
the
human
mind
went
such
prodigious
lengths
the
people
used
to
reason
about
the
soul
in
the
very
same
manner
as
we
do
the
divine
anaxagoras
in
whose
honour
an
altar
was
erected
for
his
having
taught
mankind
that
the
sun
was
greater
than
peloponnesus
that
snow
was
black
and
that
the
heavens
were
of
stone
affirmed
that
the
soul
was
an
aerial
spirit
but
at
the
same
time
immortal
diogenes
not
he
who
was
a
cynical
philosopher
after
having
coined
base
money
declared
that
the
soul
was
a
portion
of
the
substance
of
god
an
idea
which
we
must
confess
was
very
sublime
epicurus
maintained
that
it
was
composed
of
parts
in
the
same
manner
as
the
body
aristotle
who
has
been
explained
a
thousand
ways
because
he
is
unintelligible
was
of
opinion
according
to
some
of
his
disciples
that
the
understanding
in
all
men
is
one
and
the
same
substance
the
divine
plato
master
of
the
divine
aristotle
and
the
divine
socrates
master
of
the
divine
plato
used
to
say
that
the
soul
was
corporeal
and
eternal
no
doubt
but
the
demon
of
socrates
had
instructed
him
in
the
nature
of
it
some
people
indeed
pretend
that
a
man
who
boasted
his
being
attended
by
a
familiar
genius
must
infallibly
be
either
a
knave
or
a
madman
but
this
kind
of
people
are
seldom
satisfied
with
anything
but
reason
with
regard
to
the
fathers
of
the
church
several
in
the
primitive
ages
believed
that
the
soul
was
human
and
the
angels
and
god
corporeal
men
naturally
improve
upon
every
system
bernard
as
father
mabillon
confesses
taught
that
the
soul
after
death
does
not
see
god
in
the
celestial
regions
but
converses
with
christ
human
nature
only
however
he
was
not
believed
this
time
on
his
bare
word
the
adventure
of
the
crusade
having
a
little
sunk
the
credit
of
his
oracles
afterwards
a
thousand
schoolmen
arose
such
as
the
irrefragable
doctor
the
subtile
doctor
the
angelic
doctor
the
seraphic
doctor
and
the
cherubic
doctor
who
were
all
sure
that
they
had
a
very
clear
and
distinct
idea
of
the
soul
and
yet
wrote
in
such
a
manner
that
one
would
conclude
they
were
resolved
no
one
should
understand
a
word
in
their
writings
our
descartes
born
to
discover
the
errors
of
antiquity
and
at
the
same
time
to
substitute
his
own
and
hurried
away
by
that
systematic
spirit
which
throws
a
cloud
over
the
minds
of
the
greatest
men
thought
he
had
demonstrated
that
the
soul
is
the
same
thing
as
thought
in
the
same
manner
as
matter
in
his
opinion
is
the
same
as
extension
he
asserted
that
man
thinks
eternally
and
that
the
soul
at
its
coming
into
the
body
is
informed
with
the
whole
series
of
metaphysical
notions
knowing
god
infinite
space
possessing
all
abstract
ideas
in
a
word
completely
endued
with
the
most
sublime
lights
which
it
unhappily
forgets
at
its
issuing
from
the
womb
father
malebranche
in
his
sublime
illusions
not
only
admitted
innate
ideas
but
did
not
doubt
of
our
living
wholly
in
god
and
that
god
is
as
it
were
our
soul
such
a
multitude
of
reasoners
having
written
the
romance
of
the
soul
a
sage
at
last
arose
who
gave
with
an
air
of
the
greatest
modesty
the
history
of
it
locke
has
displayed
the
human
soul
in
the
same
manner
as
an
excellent
anatomist
explains
the
springs
of
the
human
body
he
everywhere
takes
the
light
of
physics
for
his
guide
he
sometimes
presumes
to
speak
affirmatively
but
then
he
presumes
also
to
doubt
instead
of
concluding
at
once
what
we
know
not
he
examines
gradually
what
we
would
know
he
takes
an
infant
at
the
instant
of
his
birth
he
traces
step
by
step
the
progress
of
his
understanding
examines
what
things
he
has
in
common
with
beasts
and
what
he
possesses
above
them
above
all
he
consults
himself
the
being
conscious
that
he
himself
thinks
i
shall
leave
says
he
to
those
who
know
more
of
this
matter
than
myself
the
examining
whether
the
soul
exists
before
or
after
the
organisation
of
our
bodies
but
i
confess
that
it
is
my
lot
to
be
animated
with
one
of
those
heavy
souls
which
do
not
think
always
and
i
am
even
so
unhappy
as
not
to
conceive
that
it
is
more
necessary
the
soul
should
think
perpetually
than
that
bodies
should
be
for
ever
in
motion
with
regard
to
myself
i
shall
boast
that
i
have
the
honour
to
be
as
stupid
in
this
particular
as
locke
no
one
shall
ever
make
me
believe
that
i
think
always
and
i
am
as
little
inclined
as
he
could
be
to
fancy
that
some
weeks
after
i
was
conceived
i
was
a
very
learned
soul
knowing
at
that
time
a
thousand
things
which
i
forgot
at
my
birth
and
possessing
when
in
the
womb
though
to
no
manner
of
purpose
knowledge
which
i
lost
the
instant
i
had
occasion
for
it
and
which
i
have
never
since
been
able
to
recover
perfectly
locke
after
having
destroyed
innate
ideas
after
having
fully
renounced
the
vanity
of
believing
that
we
think
always
after
having
laid
down
from
the
most
solid
principles
that
ideas
enter
the
mind
through
the
senses
having
examined
our
simple
and
complex
ideas
having
traced
the
human
mind
through
its
several
operations
having
shown
that
all
the
languages
in
the
world
are
imperfect
and
the
great
abuse
that
is
made
of
words
every
moment
he
at
last
comes
to
consider
the
extent
or
rather
the
narrow
limits
of
human
knowledge
it
was
in
this
chapter
he
presumed
to
advance
but
very
modestly
the
following
words
we
shall
perhaps
never
be
capable
of
knowing
whether
a
being
purely
material
thinks
or
not
this
sage
assertion
was
by
more
divines
than
one
looked
upon
as
a
scandalous
declaration
that
the
soul
is
material
and
mortal
some
englishmen
devout
after
their
way
sounded
an
alarm
the
superstitious
are
the
same
in
society
as
cowards
in
an
army
they
themselves
are
seized
with
a
panic
fear
and
communicate
it
to
others
it
was
loudly
exclaimed
that
locke
intended
to
destroy
religion
nevertheless
religion
had
nothing
to
do
in
the
affair
it
being
a
question
purely
philosophical
altogether
independent
of
faith
and
revelation
locke
opponents
needed
but
to
examine
calmly
and
impartially
whether
the
declaring
that
matter
can
think
implies
a
contradiction
and
whether
god
is
able
to
communicate
thought
to
matter
but
divines
are
too
apt
to
begin
their
declarations
with
saying
that
god
is
offended
when
people
differ
from
them
in
opinion
in
which
they
too
much
resemble
the
bad
poets
who
used
to
declare
publicly
that
boileau
spake
irreverently
of
louis
because
he
ridiculed
their
stupid
productions
bishop
stillingfleet
got
the
reputation
of
a
calm
and
unprejudiced
divine
because
he
did
not
expressly
make
use
of
injurious
terms
in
his
dispute
with
locke
that
divine
entered
the
lists
against
him
but
was
defeated
for
he
argued
as
a
schoolman
and
locke
as
a
philosopher
who
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
strong
as
well
as
the
weak
side
of
the
human
mind
and
who
fought
with
weapons
whose
temper
he
knew
if
i
might
presume
to
give
my
opinion
on
so
delicate
a
subject
after
locke
i
would
say
that
men
have
long
disputed
on
the
nature
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
with
regard
to
its
immortality
it
is
impossible
to
give
a
demonstration
of
it
since
its
nature
is
still
the
subject
of
controversy
which
however
must
be
thoroughly
understood
before
a
person
can
be
able
to
determine
whether
it
be
immortal
or
not
human
reason
is
so
little
able
merely
by
its
own
strength
to
demonstrate
the
immortality
of
the
soul
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
religion
should
reveal
it
to
us
it
is
of
advantage
to
society
in
general
that
mankind
should
believe
the
soul
to
be
immortal
faith
commands
us
to
do
this
nothing
more
is
required
and
the
matter
is
cleared
up
at
once
but
it
is
otherwise
with
respect
to
its
nature
it
is
of
little
importance
to
religion
which
only
requires
the
soul
to
be
virtuous
whatever
substance
it
may
be
made
of
it
is
a
clock
which
is
given
us
to
regulate
but
the
artist
has
not
told
us
of
what
materials
the
spring
of
this
chock
is
composed
i
am
a
body
and
i
think
that
all
i
know
of
the
matter
shall
i
ascribe
to
an
unknown
cause
what
i
can
so
easily
impute
to
the
only
second
cause
i
am
acquainted
with
here
all
the
school
philosophers
interrupt
me
with
their
arguments
and
declare
that
there
is
only
extension
and
solidity
in
bodies
and
that
there
they
can
have
nothing
but
motion
and
figure
now
motion
figure
extension
and
solidity
can
not
form
a
thought
and
consequently
the
soul
can
not
be
matter
all
this
so
often
repeated
mighty
series
of
reasoning
amounts
to
no
more
than
this
i
am
absolutely
ignorant
what
matter
is
i
guess
but
imperfectly
some
properties
of
it
now
i
absolutely
can
not
tell
whether
these
properties
may
be
joined
to
thought
as
i
therefore
know
nothing
i
maintain
positively
that
matter
can
not
think
in
this
manner
do
the
schools
reason
locke
addressed
these
gentlemen
in
the
candid
sincere
manner
following
at
least
confess
yourselves
to
be
as
ignorant
as
i
neither
your
imaginations
nor
mine
are
able
to
comprehend
in
what
manner
a
body
is
susceptible
of
ideas
and
do
you
conceive
better
in
what
manner
a
substance
of
what
kind
soever
is
susceptible
of
them
as
you
can
not
comprehend
either
matter
or
spirit
why
will
you
presume
to
assert
anything
the
superstitious
man
comes
afterwards
and
declares
that
all
those
must
be
burnt
for
the
good
of
their
souls
who
so
much
as
suspect
that
it
is
possible
for
the
body
to
think
without
any
foreign
assistance
but
what
would
these
people
say
should
they
themselves
be
proved
irreligious
and
indeed
what
man
can
presume
to
assert
without
being
guilty
at
the
same
time
of
the
greatest
impiety
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
creator
to
form
matter
with
thought
and
sensation
consider
only
i
beg
you
what
a
dilemma
you
bring
yourselves
into
you
who
confine
in
this
manner
the
power
of
the
creator
beasts
have
the
same
organs
the
same
sensations
the
same
perceptions
as
we
they
have
memory
and
combine
certain
ideas
in
case
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
god
to
animate
matter
and
inform
it
with
sensation
the
consequence
would
be
either
that
beasts
are
mere
machines
or
that
they
have
a
spiritual
soul
methinks
it
is
clearly
evident
that
beasts
can
not
be
mere
machines
which
i
prove
thus
god
has
given
to
them
the
very
same
organs
of
sensation
as
to
us
if
therefore
they
have
no
sensation
god
has
created
a
useless
thing
now
according
to
your
own
confession
god
does
nothing
in
vain
he
therefore
did
not
create
so
many
organs
of
sensation
merely
for
them
to
be
uninformed
with
this
faculty
consequently
beasts
are
not
mere
machines
beasts
according
to
your
assertion
can
not
be
animated
with
a
spiritual
soul
you
will
therefore
in
spite
of
yourself
be
reduced
to
this
only
assertion
that
god
has
endued
the
organs
of
beasts
who
are
mere
matter
with
the
faculties
of
sensation
and
perception
which
you
call
instinct
in
them
but
why
may
not
god
if
he
pleases
communicate
to
our
more
delicate
organs
that
faculty
of
feeling
perceiving
and
thinking
which
we
call
human
reason
to
whatever
side
you
turn
you
are
forced
to
acknowledge
your
own
ignorance
and
the
boundless
power
of
the
creator
exclaim
therefore
no
more
against
the
sage
the
modest
philosophy
of
locke
which
so
far
from
interfering
with
religion
would
be
of
use
to
demonstrate
the
truth
of
it
in
case
religion
wanted
any
such
support
for
what
philosophy
can
be
of
a
more
religious
nature
than
that
which
affirming
nothing
but
what
it
conceives
clearly
and
conscious
of
its
own
weakness
declares
that
we
must
always
have
recourse
to
god
in
our
examining
of
the
first
principles
besides
we
must
not
be
apprehensive
that
any
philosophical
opinion
will
ever
prejudice
the
religion
of
a
country
though
our
demonstrations
clash
directly
with
our
mysteries
that
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
for
the
latter
are
not
less
revered
upon
that
account
by
our
christian
philosophers
who
know
very
well
that
the
objects
of
reason
and
those
of
faith
are
of
a
very
different
nature
philosophers
will
never
form
a
religious
sect
the
reason
of
which
is
their
writings
are
not
calculated
for
the
vulgar
and
they
themselves
are
free
from
enthusiasm
if
we
divide
mankind
into
twenty
parts
it
will
be
found
that
nineteen
of
these
consist
of
persons
employed
in
manual
labour
who
will
never
know
that
such
a
man
as
locke
existed
in
the
remaining
twentieth
part
how
few
are
readers
and
among
such
as
are
so
twenty
amuse
themselves
with
romances
to
one
who
studies
philosophy
the
thinking
part
of
mankind
is
confined
to
a
very
small
number
and
these
will
never
disturb
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
the
world
neither
montaigne
locke
bayle
spinoza
hobbes
the
lord
shaftesbury
collins
nor
toland
lighted
up
the
firebrand
of
discord
in
their
countries
this
has
generally
been
the
work
of
divines
who
being
at
first
puffed
up
with
the
ambition
of
becoming
chiefs
of
a
sect
soon
grew
very
desirous
of
being
at
the
head
of
a
party
but
what
do
i
say
all
the
works
of
the
modern
philosophers
put
together
will
never
make
so
much
noise
as
even
the
dispute
which
arose
among
the
franciscans
merely
about
the
fashion
of
their
sleeves
and
of
their
cowls
letter
on
descartes
and
sir
isaac
newton
a
frenchman
who
arrives
in
london
will
find
philosophy
like
everything
else
very
much
changed
there
he
had
left
the
world
a
plenum
and
he
now
finds
it
a
vacuum
at
paris
the
universe
is
seen
composed
of
vortices
of
subtile
matter
but
nothing
like
it
is
seen
in
london
in
france
it
is
the
pressure
of
the
moon
that
causes
the
tides
but
in
england
it
is
the
sea
that
gravitates
towards
the
moon
so
that
when
you
think
that
the
moon
should
make
it
flood
with
us
those
gentlemen
fancy
it
should
be
ebb
which
very
unluckily
can
not
be
proved
for
to
be
able
to
do
this
it
is
necessary
the
moon
and
the
tides
should
have
been
inquired
into
at
the
very
instant
of
the
creation
you
will
observe
farther
that
the
sun
which
in
france
is
said
to
have
nothing
to
do
in
the
affair
comes
in
here
for
very
near
a
quarter
of
its
assistance
according
to
your
cartesians
everything
is
performed
by
an
impulsion
of
which
we
have
very
little
notion
and
according
to
sir
isaac
newton
it
is
by
an
attraction
the
cause
of
which
is
as
much
unknown
to
us
at
paris
you
imagine
that
the
earth
is
shaped
like
a
melon
or
of
an
oblique
figure
at
london
it
has
an
oblate
one
a
cartesian
declares
that
light
exists
in
the
air
but
a
newtonian
asserts
that
it
comes
from
the
sun
in
six
minutes
and
a
half
the
several
operations
of
your
chemistry
are
performed
by
acids
alkalies
and
subtile
matter
but
attraction
prevails
even
in
chemistry
among
the
english
the
very
essence
of
things
is
totally
changed
you
neither
are
agreed
upon
the
definition
of
the
soul
nor
on
that
of
matter
descartes
as
i
observed
in
my
last
maintains
that
the
soul
is
the
same
thing
with
thought
and
locke
has
given
a
pretty
good
proof
of
the
contrary
descartes
asserts
farther
that
extension
alone
constitutes
matter
but
sir
isaac
adds
solidity
to
it
how
furiously
contradictory
are
these
opinions
non
nostrum
inter
vos
tantas
componere
lites
virgil
eclog
iii
is
not
for
us
to
end
such
great
disputes
this
famous
newton
this
destroyer
of
the
cartesian
system
died
in
march
anno
his
countrymen
honoured
him
in
his
lifetime
and
interred
him
as
though
he
had
been
a
king
who
had
made
his
people
happy
the
english
read
with
the
highest
satisfaction
and
translated
into
their
tongue
the
elogium
of
sir
isaac
newton
which
de
fontenelle
spoke
in
the
academy
of
sciences
de
fontenelle
presides
as
judge
over
philosophers
and
the
english
expected
his
decision
as
a
solemn
declaration
of
the
superiority
of
the
english
philosophy
over
that
of
the
french
but
when
it
was
found
that
this
gentleman
had
compared
descartes
to
sir
isaac
the
whole
royal
society
in
london
rose
up
in
arms
so
far
from
acquiescing
with
fontenelle
judgment
they
criticised
his
discourse
and
even
several
who
however
were
not
the
ablest
philosophers
in
that
body
were
offended
at
the
comparison
and
for
no
other
reason
but
because
descartes
was
a
frenchman
it
must
be
confessed
that
these
two
great
men
differed
very
much
in
conduct
in
fortune
and
in
philosophy
nature
had
indulged
descartes
with
a
shining
and
strong
imagination
whence
he
became
a
very
singular
person
both
in
private
life
and
in
his
manner
of
reasoning
this
imagination
could
not
conceal
itself
even
in
his
philosophical
works
which
are
everywhere
adorned
with
very
shining
ingenious
metaphors
and
figures
nature
had
almost
made
him
a
poet
and
indeed
he
wrote
a
piece
of
poetry
for
the
entertainment
of
christina
queen
of
sweden
which
however
was
suppressed
in
honour
to
his
memory
he
embraced
a
military
life
for
some
time
and
afterwards
becoming
a
complete
philosopher
he
did
not
think
the
passion
of
love
derogatory
to
his
character
he
had
by
his
mistress
a
daughter
called
froncine
who
died
young
and
was
very
much
regretted
by
him
thus
he
experienced
every
passion
incident
to
mankind
he
was
a
long
time
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
fly
from
the
society
of
his
fellow
creatures
and
especially
from
his
native
country
in
order
to
enjoy
the
happiness
of
cultivating
his
philosophical
studies
in
full
liberty
descartes
was
very
right
for
his
contemporaries
were
not
knowing
enough
to
improve
and
enlighten
his
understanding
and
were
capable
of
little
else
than
of
giving
him
uneasiness
he
left
france
purely
to
go
in
search
of
truth
which
was
then
persecuted
by
the
wretched
philosophy
of
the
schools
however
he
found
that
reason
was
as
much
disguised
and
depraved
in
the
universities
of
holland
into
which
he
withdrew
as
in
his
own
country
for
at
the
time
that
the
french
condemned
the
only
propositions
of
his
philosophy
which
were
true
he
was
persecuted
by
the
pretended
philosophers
of
holland
who
understood
him
no
better
and
who
having
a
nearer
view
of
his
glory
hated
his
person
the
more
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
leave
utrecht
descartes
was
injuriously
accused
of
being
an
atheist
the
last
refuge
of
religious
scandal
and
he
who
had
employed
all
the
sagacity
and
penetration
of
his
genius
in
searching
for
new
proofs
of
the
existence
of
a
god
was
suspected
to
believe
there
was
no
such
being
such
a
persecution
from
all
sides
must
necessarily
suppose
a
most
exalted
merit
as
well
as
a
very
distinguished
reputation
and
indeed
he
possessed
both
reason
at
that
time
darted
a
ray
upon
the
world
through
the
gloom
of
the
schools
and
the
prejudices
of
popular
superstition
at
last
his
name
spread
so
universally
that
the
french
were
desirous
of
bringing
him
back
into
his
native
country
by
rewards
and
accordingly
offered
him
an
annual
pension
of
a
thousand
crowns
upon
these
hopes
descartes
returned
to
france
paid
the
fees
of
his
patent
which
was
sold
at
that
time
but
no
pension
was
settled
upon
him
thus
disappointed
he
returned
to
his
solitude
in
north
holland
where
he
again
pursued
the
study
of
philosophy
whilst
the
great
galileo
at
fourscore
years
of
age
was
groaning
in
the
prisons
of
the
inquisition
only
for
having
demonstrated
the
earth
motion
at
last
descartes
was
snatched
from
the
world
in
the
flower
of
his
age
at
stockholm
his
death
was
owing
to
a
bad
regimen
and
he
expired
in
the
midst
of
some
literati
who
were
his
enemies
and
under
the
hands
of
a
physician
to
whom
he
was
odious
the
progress
of
sir
isaac
newton
life
was
quite
different
he
lived
happy
and
very
much
honoured
in
his
native
country
to
the
age
of
fourscore
and
five
years
it
was
his
peculiar
felicity
not
only
to
be
born
in
a
country
of
liberty
but
in
an
age
when
all
scholastic
impertinences
were
banished
from
the
world
reason
alone
was
cultivated
and
mankind
could
only
be
his
pupil
not
his
enemy
one
very
singular
difference
in
the
lives
of
these
two
great
men
is
that
sir
isaac
during
the
long
course
of
years
he
enjoyed
was
never
sensible
to
any
passion
was
not
subject
to
the
common
frailties
of
mankind
nor
ever
had
any
commerce
with
women
a
circumstance
which
was
assured
me
by
the
physician
and
surgeon
who
attended
him
in
his
last
moments
we
may
admire
sir
isaac
newton
on
this
occasion
but
then
we
must
not
censure
descartes
the
opinion
that
generally
prevails
in
england
with
regard
to
these
new
philosophers
is
that
the
latter
was
a
dreamer
and
the
former
a
sage
very
few
people
in
england
read
descartes
whose
works
indeed
are
now
useless
on
the
other
side
but
a
small
number
peruse
those
of
sir
isaac
because
to
do
this
the
student
must
be
deeply
skilled
in
the
mathematics
otherwise
those
works
will
be
unintelligible
to
him
but
notwithstanding
this
these
great
men
are
the
subject
of
discourse
sir
isaac
newton
is
allowed
every
advantage
whilst
descartes
is
not
indulged
a
single
one
according
to
some
it
is
to
the
former
that
we
owe
the
discovery
of
a
vacuum
that
the
air
is
a
heavy
body
and
the
invention
of
telescopes
in
a
word
sir
isaac
newton
is
here
as
the
hercules
of
fabulous
story
to
whom
the
ignorant
ascribed
all
the
feats
of
ancient
heroes
in
a
critique
that
was
made
in
london
on
de
fontenelle
discourse
the
writer
presumed
to
assert
that
descartes
was
not
a
great
geometrician
those
who
make
such
a
declaration
may
justly
be
reproached
with
flying
in
their
master
face
descartes
extended
the
limits
of
geometry
as
far
beyond
the
place
where
he
found
them
as
sir
isaac
did
after
him
the
former
first
taught
the
method
of
expressing
curves
by
equations
this
geometry
which
thanks
to
him
for
it
is
now
grown
common
was
so
abstruse
in
his
time
that
not
so
much
as
one
professor
would
undertake
to
explain
it
and
schotten
in
holland
and
format
in
france
were
the
only
men
who
understood
it
he
applied
this
geometrical
and
inventive
genius
to
dioptrics
which
when
treated
of
by
him
became
a
new
art
and
if
he
was
mistaken
in
some
things
the
reason
of
that
is
a
man
who
discovers
a
new
tract
of
land
can
not
at
once
know
all
the
properties
of
the
soil
those
who
come
after
him
and
make
these
lands
fruitful
are
at
least
obliged
to
him
for
the
discovery
i
will
not
deny
but
that
there
are
innumerable
errors
in
the
rest
of
descartes
works
geometry
was
a
guide
he
himself
had
in
some
measure
fashioned
which
would
have
conducted
him
safely
through
the
several
paths
of
natural
philosophy
nevertheless
he
at
last
abandoned
this
guide
and
gave
entirely
into
the
humour
of
forming
hypotheses
and
then
philosophy
was
no
more
than
an
ingenious
romance
fit
only
to
amuse
the
ignorant
he
was
mistaken
in
the
nature
of
the
soul
in
the
proofs
of
the
existence
of
a
god
in
matter
in
the
laws
of
motion
and
in
the
nature
of
light
he
admitted
innate
ideas
he
invented
new
elements
he
created
a
world
he
made
man
according
to
his
own
fancy
and
it
is
justly
said
that
the
man
of
descartes
is
in
fact
that
of
descartes
only
very
different
from
the
real
one
he
pushed
his
metaphysical
errors
so
far
as
to
declare
that
two
and
two
make
four
for
no
other
reason
but
because
god
would
have
it
so
however
it
will
not
be
making
him
too
great
a
compliment
if
we
affirm
that
he
was
valuable
even
in
his
mistakes
he
deceived
himself
but
then
it
was
at
least
in
a
methodical
way
he
destroyed
all
the
absurd
chimeras
with
which
youth
had
been
infatuated
for
two
thousand
years
he
taught
his
contemporaries
how
to
reason
and
enabled
them
to
employ
his
own
weapons
against
himself
if
descartes
did
not
pay
in
good
money
he
however
did
great
service
in
crying
down
that
of
a
base
alloy
i
indeed
believe
that
very
few
will
presume
to
compare
his
philosophy
in
any
respect
with
that
of
sir
isaac
newton
the
former
is
an
essay
the
latter
a
masterpiece
but
then
the
man
who
first
brought
us
to
the
path
of
truth
was
perhaps
as
great
a
genius
as
he
who
afterwards
conducted
us
through
it
descartes
gave
sight
to
the
blind
these
saw
the
errors
of
antiquity
and
of
the
sciences
the
path
he
struck
out
is
since
become
boundless
rohault
little
work
was
during
some
years
a
complete
system
of
physics
but
now
all
the
transactions
of
the
several
academies
in
europe
put
together
do
not
form
so
much
as
the
beginning
of
a
system
in
fathoming
this
abyss
no
bottom
has
been
found
we
are
now
to
examine
what
discoveries
sir
isaac
newton
has
made
in
it
letter
on
attraction
the
discoveries
which
gained
sir
isaac
newton
so
universal
a
reputation
relate
to
the
system
of
the
world
to
light
to
geometrical
infinities
and
lastly
to
chronology
with
which
he
used
to
amuse
himself
after
the
fatigue
of
his
severer
studies
i
will
now
acquaint
you
without
prolixity
if
possible
with
the
few
things
i
have
been
able
to
comprehend
of
all
these
sublime
ideas
with
regard
to
the
system
of
our
world
disputes
were
a
long
time
maintained
on
the
cause
that
turns
the
planets
and
keeps
them
in
their
orbits
and
on
those
causes
which
make
all
bodies
here
below
descend
towards
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
system
of
descartes
explained
and
improved
since
his
time
seemed
to
give
a
plausible
reason
for
all
those
phenomena
and
this
reason
seemed
more
just
as
it
is
simple
and
intelligible
to
all
capacities
but
in
philosophy
a
student
ought
to
doubt
of
the
things
he
fancies
he
understands
too
easily
as
much
as
of
those
he
does
not
understand
gravity
the
falling
of
accelerated
bodies
on
the
earth
the
revolution
of
the
planets
in
their
orbits
their
rotations
round
their
axis
all
this
is
mere
motion
now
motion
can
not
perhaps
be
conceived
any
otherwise
than
by
impulsion
therefore
all
those
bodies
must
be
impelled
but
by
what
are
they
impelled
all
space
is
full
it
therefore
is
filled
with
a
very
subtile
matter
since
this
is
imperceptible
to
us
this
matter
goes
from
west
to
east
since
all
the
planets
are
carried
from
west
to
east
thus
from
hypothesis
to
hypothesis
from
one
appearance
to
another
philosophers
have
imagined
a
vast
whirlpool
of
subtile
matter
in
which
the
planets
are
carried
round
the
sun
they
also
have
created
another
particular
vortex
which
floats
in
the
great
one
and
which
turns
daily
round
the
planets
when
all
this
is
done
it
is
pretended
that
gravity
depends
on
this
diurnal
motion
for
say
these
the
velocity
of
the
subtile
matter
that
turns
round
our
little
vortex
must
be
seventeen
times
more
rapid
than
that
of
the
earth
or
in
case
its
velocity
is
seventeen
times
greater
than
that
of
the
earth
its
centrifugal
force
must
be
vastly
greater
and
consequently
impel
all
bodies
towards
the
earth
this
is
the
cause
of
gravity
according
to
the
cartesian
system
but
the
theorist
before
he
calculated
the
centrifugal
force
and
velocity
of
the
subtile
matter
should
first
have
been
certain
that
it
existed
sir
isaac
newton
seems
to
have
destroyed
all
these
great
and
little
vortices
both
that
which
carries
the
planets
round
the
sun
as
well
as
the
other
which
supposes
every
planet
to
turn
on
its
own
axis
first
with
regard
to
the
pretended
little
vortex
of
the
earth
it
is
demonstrated
that
it
must
lose
its
motion
by
insensible
degrees
it
is
demonstrated
that
if
the
earth
swims
in
a
fluid
its
density
must
be
equal
to
that
of
the
earth
and
in
case
its
density
be
the
same
all
the
bodies
we
endeavour
to
move
must
meet
with
an
insuperable
resistance
with
regard
to
the
great
vortices
they
are
still
more
chimerical
and
it
is
impossible
to
make
them
agree
with
kepler
law
the
truth
of
which
has
been
demonstrated
sir
isaac
shows
that
the
revolution
of
the
fluid
in
which
jupiter
is
supposed
to
be
carried
is
not
the
same
with
regard
to
the
revolution
of
the
fluid
of
the
earth
as
the
revolution
of
jupiter
with
respect
to
that
of
the
earth
he
proves
that
as
the
planets
make
their
revolutions
in
ellipses
and
consequently
being
at
a
much
greater
distance
one
from
the
other
in
their
aphelia
and
a
little
nearer
in
their
perihelia
the
earth
velocity
for
instance
ought
to
be
greater
when
it
is
nearer
venus
and
mars
because
the
fluid
that
carries
it
along
being
then
more
pressed
ought
to
have
a
greater
motion
and
yet
it
is
even
then
that
the
earth
motion
is
slower
he
proves
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
celestial
matter
which
goes
from
west
to
east
since
the
comets
traverse
those
spaces
sometimes
from
east
to
west
and
at
other
times
from
north
to
south
in
fine
the
better
to
resolve
if
possible
every
difficulty
he
proves
and
even
by
experiments
that
it
is
impossible
there
should
be
a
plenum
and
brings
back
the
vacuum
which
aristotle
and
descartes
had
banished
from
the
world
having
by
these
and
several
other
arguments
destroyed
the
cartesian
vortices
he
despaired
of
ever
being
able
to
discover
whether
there
is
a
secret
principle
in
nature
which
at
the
same
time
is
the
cause
of
the
motion
of
all
celestial
bodies
and
that
of
gravity
on
the
earth
but
being
retired
in
upon
account
of
the
plague
to
a
solitude
near
cambridge
as
he
was
walking
one
day
in
his
garden
and
saw
some
fruits
fall
from
a
tree
he
fell
into
a
profound
meditation
on
that
gravity
the
cause
of
which
had
so
long
been
sought
but
in
vain
by
all
the
philosophers
whilst
the
vulgar
think
there
is
nothing
mysterious
in
it
he
said
to
himself
that
from
what
height
soever
in
our
hemisphere
those
bodies
might
descend
their
fall
would
certainly
be
in
the
progression
discovered
by
galileo
and
the
spaces
they
run
through
would
be
as
the
square
of
the
times
why
may
not
this
power
which
causes
heavy
bodies
to
descend
and
is
the
same
without
any
sensible
diminution
at
the
remotest
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
or
on
the
summits
of
the
highest
mountains
why
said
sir
isaac
may
not
this
power
extend
as
high
as
the
moon
and
in
case
its
influence
reaches
so
far
is
it
not
very
probable
that
this
power
retains
it
in
its
orbit
and
determines
its
motion
but
in
case
the
moon
obeys
this
principle
whatever
it
be
may
we
not
conclude
very
naturally
that
the
rest
of
the
planets
are
equally
subject
to
it
in
case
this
power
exists
which
besides
is
proved
it
must
increase
in
an
inverse
ratio
of
the
squares
of
the
distances
all
therefore
that
remains
is
to
examine
how
far
a
heavy
body
which
should
fall
upon
the
earth
from
a
moderate
height
would
go
and
how
far
in
the
same
time
a
body
which
should
fall
from
the
orbit
of
the
moon
would
descend
to
find
this
nothing
is
wanted
but
the
measure
of
the
earth
and
the
distance
of
the
moon
from
it
thus
sir
isaac
newton
reasoned
but
at
that
time
the
english
had
but
a
very
imperfect
measure
of
our
globe
and
depended
on
the
uncertain
supposition
of
mariners
who
computed
a
degree
to
contain
but
sixty
english
miles
whereas
it
consists
in
reality
of
near
seventy
as
this
false
computation
did
not
agree
with
the
conclusions
which
sir
isaac
intended
to
draw
from
them
he
laid
aside
this
pursuit
a
philosopher
remarkable
only
for
his
vanity
would
have
made
the
measure
of
the
earth
agree
anyhow
with
his
system
sir
isaac
however
chose
rather
to
quit
the
researches
he
was
then
engaged
in
but
after
picard
had
measured
the
earth
exactly
by
tracing
that
meridian
which
redounds
so
much
to
the
honour
of
the
french
sir
isaac
newton
resumed
his
former
reflections
and
found
his
account
in
calculation
a
circumstance
which
has
always
appeared
wonderful
to
me
is
that
such
sublime
discoveries
should
have
been
made
by
the
sole
assistance
of
a
quadrant
and
a
little
arithmetic
the
circumference
of
the
earth
is
feet
this
among
other
things
is
necessary
to
prove
the
system
of
attraction
the
instant
we
know
the
earth
circumference
and
the
distance
of
the
moon
we
know
that
of
the
moon
orbit
and
the
diameter
of
this
orbit
the
moon
performs
its
revolution
in
that
orbit
in
days
seven
hours
minutes
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
moon
in
its
mean
motion
makes
an
hundred
and
fourscore
and
seven
thousand
nine
hundred
and
sixty
feet
of
paris
in
a
minute
it
is
likewise
demonstrated
by
a
known
theorem
that
the
central
force
which
should
make
a
body
fall
from
the
height
of
the
moon
would
make
its
velocity
no
more
than
fifteen
paris
feet
in
a
minute
of
time
now
if
the
law
by
which
bodies
gravitate
and
attract
one
another
in
an
inverse
ratio
to
the
squares
of
the
distances
be
true
if
the
same
power
acts
according
to
that
law
throughout
all
nature
it
is
evident
that
as
the
earth
is
sixty
distant
from
the
moon
a
heavy
body
must
necessarily
fall
on
the
earth
fifteen
feet
in
the
first
second
and
thousand
feet
in
the
first
minute
now
a
heavy
body
falls
in
reality
fifteen
feet
in
the
first
second
and
goes
in
the
first
minute
thousand
feet
which
number
is
the
square
of
sixty
multiplied
by
fifteen
bodies
therefore
gravitate
in
an
inverse
ratio
of
the
squares
of
the
distances
consequently
what
causes
gravity
on
earth
and
keeps
the
moon
in
its
orbit
is
one
and
the
same
power
it
being
demonstrated
that
the
moon
gravitates
on
the
earth
which
is
the
centre
of
its
particular
motion
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
earth
and
the
moon
gravitate
on
the
sun
which
is
the
centre
of
their
annual
motion
the
rest
of
the
planets
must
be
subject
to
this
general
law
and
if
this
law
exists
these
planets
must
follow
the
laws
which
kepler
discovered
all
these
laws
all
these
relations
are
indeed
observed
by
the
planets
with
the
utmost
exactness
therefore
the
power
of
attraction
causes
all
the
planets
to
gravitate
towards
the
sun
in
like
manner
as
the
moon
gravitates
towards
our
globe
finally
as
in
all
bodies
is
equal
to
action
it
is
certain
that
the
earth
gravitates
also
towards
the
moon
and
that
the
sun
gravitates
towards
both
that
every
one
of
the
satellites
of
saturn
gravitates
towards
the
other
four
and
the
other
four
towards
it
all
five
towards
saturn
and
saturn
towards
all
that
it
is
the
same
with
regard
to
jupiter
and
that
all
these
globes
are
attracted
by
the
sun
which
is
reciprocally
attracted
by
them
this
power
of
gravitation
acts
proportionably
to
the
quantity
of
matter
in
bodies
a
truth
which
sir
isaac
has
demonstrated
by
experiments
this
new
discovery
has
been
of
use
to
show
that
the
sun
the
centre
of
the
planetary
system
attracts
them
all
in
a
direct
ratio
of
their
quantity
of
matter
combined
with
their
nearness
from
hence
sir
isaac
rising
by
degrees
to
discoveries
which
seemed
not
to
be
formed
for
the
human
mind
is
bold
enough
to
compute
the
quantity
of
matter
contained
in
the
sun
and
in
every
planet
and
in
this
manner
shows
from
the
simple
laws
of
mechanics
that
every
celestial
globe
ought
necessarily
to
be
where
it
is
placed
his
bare
principle
of
the
laws
of
gravitation
accounts
for
all
the
apparent
inequalities
in
the
course
of
the
celestial
globes
the
variations
of
the
moon
are
a
necessary
consequence
of
those
laws
moreover
the
reason
is
evidently
seen
why
the
nodes
of
the
moon
perform
their
revolutions
in
nineteen
years
and
those
of
the
earth
in
about
thousand
the
several
appearances
observed
in
the
tides
are
also
a
very
simple
effect
of
this
attraction
the
proximity
of
the
moon
when
at
the
full
and
when
it
is
new
and
its
distance
in
the
quadratures
or
quarters
combined
with
the
action
of
the
sun
exhibit
a
sensible
reason
why
the
ocean
swells
and
sinks
after
having
shown
by
his
sublime
theory
the
course
and
inequalities
of
the
planets
he
subjects
comets
to
the
same
law
the
orbit
of
these
fires
unknown
for
so
great
a
series
of
years
which
was
the
terror
of
mankind
and
the
rock
against
which
philosophy
split
placed
by
aristotle
below
the
moon
and
sent
back
by
descartes
above
the
sphere
of
saturn
is
at
last
placed
in
its
proper
seat
by
sir
isaac
newton
he
proves
that
comets
are
solid
bodies
which
move
in
the
sphere
of
the
sun
activity
and
that
they
describe
an
ellipsis
so
very
eccentric
and
so
near
to
parabolas
that
certain
comets
must
take
up
above
five
hundred
years
in
their
revolution
the
learned
halley
is
of
opinion
that
the
comet
seen
in
is
the
same
which
appeared
in
julius
caesar
time
this
shows
more
than
any
other
that
comets
are
hard
opaque
bodies
for
it
descended
so
near
to
the
sun
as
to
come
within
a
sixth
part
of
the
diameter
of
this
planet
from
it
and
consequently
might
have
contracted
a
degree
of
heat
two
thousand
times
stronger
than
that
of
iron
and
would
have
been
soon
dispersed
in
vapour
had
it
not
been
a
firm
dense
body
the
guessing
the
course
of
comets
began
then
to
be
very
much
in
vogue
the
celebrated
bernoulli
concluded
by
his
system
that
the
famous
comet
of
would
appear
again
the
of
may
not
a
single
astronomer
in
europe
went
to
bed
that
night
however
they
needed
not
to
have
broke
their
rest
for
the
famous
comet
never
appeared
there
is
at
least
more
cunning
if
not
more
certainty
in
fixing
its
return
to
so
remote
a
distance
as
five
hundred
and
years
as
to
whiston
he
affirmed
very
seriously
that
in
the
time
of
the
deluge
a
comet
overflowed
the
terrestrial
globe
and
he
was
so
unreasonable
as
to
wonder
that
people
laughed
at
him
for
making
such
an
assertion
the
ancients
were
almost
in
the
same
way
of
thinking
with
whiston
and
fancied
that
comets
were
always
the
forerunners
of
some
great
calamity
which
was
to
befall
mankind
sir
isaac
newton
on
the
contrary
suspected
that
they
are
very
beneficent
and
that
vapours
exhale
from
them
merely
to
nourish
and
vivify
the
planets
which
imbibe
in
their
course
the
several
particles
the
sun
has
detached
from
the
comets
an
opinion
which
at
least
is
more
probable
than
the
former
but
this
is
not
all
if
this
power
of
gravitation
or
attraction
acts
on
all
the
celestial
globes
it
acts
undoubtedly
on
the
several
parts
of
these
globes
for
in
case
bodies
attract
one
another
in
proportion
to
the
quantity
of
matter
contained
in
them
it
can
only
be
in
proportion
to
the
quantity
of
their
parts
and
if
this
power
is
found
in
the
whole
it
is
undoubtedly
in
the
half
in
the
quarters
in
the
eighth
part
and
so
on
in
this
is
attraction
the
great
spring
by
which
all
nature
is
moved
sir
isaac
newton
after
having
demonstrated
the
existence
of
this
principle
plainly
foresaw
that
its
very
name
would
offend
and
therefore
this
philosopher
in
more
places
than
one
of
his
books
gives
the
reader
some
caution
about
it
he
bids
him
beware
of
confounding
this
name
with
what
the
ancients
called
occult
qualities
but
to
be
satisfied
with
knowing
that
there
is
in
all
bodies
a
central
force
which
acts
to
the
utmost
limits
of
the
universe
according
to
the
invariable
laws
of
mechanics
it
is
surprising
after
the
solemn
protestations
sir
isaac
made
that
such
eminent
men
as
sorin
and
de
fontenelle
should
have
imputed
to
this
great
philosopher
the
verbal
and
chimerical
way
of
reasoning
of
the
aristotelians
sorin
in
the
memoirs
of
the
academy
of
and
de
fontenelle
in
the
very
eulogium
of
sir
isaac
newton
most
of
the
french
the
learned
and
others
have
repeated
this
reproach
these
are
for
ever
crying
out
why
did
he
not
employ
the
word
which
is
so
well
understood
rather
than
that
of
which
is
unintelligible
sir
isaac
might
have
answered
these
critics
thus
first
you
have
as
imperfect
an
idea
of
the
word
impulsion
as
of
that
of
attraction
and
in
case
you
can
not
conceive
how
one
body
tends
towards
the
centre
of
another
body
neither
can
you
conceive
by
what
power
one
body
can
impel
another
secondly
i
could
not
admit
of
impulsion
for
to
do
this
i
must
have
known
that
a
celestial
matter
was
the
agent
but
so
far
from
knowing
that
there
is
any
such
matter
i
have
proved
it
to
be
merely
imaginary
thirdly
i
use
the
word
attraction
for
no
other
reason
but
to
express
an
effect
which
i
discovered
in
nature
a
certain
and
indisputable
effect
of
an
unknown
principle
a
quality
inherent
in
matter
the
cause
of
which
persons
of
greater
abilities
than
i
can
pretend
to
may
if
they
can
find
out
what
have
you
then
taught
us
will
these
people
say
further
and
to
what
purpose
are
so
many
calculations
to
tell
us
what
you
yourself
do
not
comprehend
i
have
taught
you
may
sir
isaac
rejoin
that
all
bodies
gravitate
towards
one
another
in
proportion
to
their
quantity
of
matter
that
these
central
forces
alone
keep
the
planets
and
comets
in
their
orbits
and
cause
them
to
move
in
the
proportion
before
set
down
i
demonstrate
to
you
that
it
is
impossible
there
should
be
any
other
cause
which
keeps
the
planets
in
their
orbits
than
that
general
phenomenon
of
gravity
for
heavy
bodies
fall
on
the
earth
according
to
the
proportion
demonstrated
of
central
forces
and
the
planets
finishing
their
course
according
to
these
same
proportions
in
case
there
were
another
power
that
acted
upon
all
those
bodies
it
would
either
increase
their
velocity
or
change
their
direction
now
not
one
of
those
bodies
ever
has
a
single
degree
of
motion
or
velocity
or
has
any
direction
but
what
is
demonstrated
to
be
the
effect
of
the
central
forces
consequently
it
is
impossible
there
should
be
any
other
principle
give
me
leave
once
more
to
introduce
sir
isaac
speaking
shall
he
not
be
allowed
to
say
my
case
and
that
of
the
ancients
is
very
different
these
saw
for
instance
water
ascend
in
pumps
and
said
water
rises
because
it
abhors
a
vacuum
but
with
regard
to
myself
i
am
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
should
have
first
observed
that
water
ascends
in
pumps
but
should
leave
others
to
explain
the
cause
of
this
effect
the
anatomist
who
first
declared
that
the
motion
of
the
arm
is
owing
to
the
contraction
of
the
muscles
taught
mankind
an
indisputable
truth
but
are
they
less
obliged
to
him
because
he
did
not
know
the
reason
why
the
muscles
contract
the
cause
of
the
elasticity
of
the
air
is
unknown
but
he
who
first
discovered
this
spring
performed
a
very
signal
service
to
natural
philosophy
the
spring
that
i
discovered
was
more
hidden
and
more
universal
and
for
that
very
reason
mankind
ought
to
thank
me
the
more
i
have
discovered
a
new
property
of
matter
one
of
the
secrets
of
the
creator
and
have
calculated
and
discovered
the
effects
of
it
after
this
shall
people
quarrel
with
me
about
the
name
i
give
it
vortices
may
be
called
an
occult
quality
because
their
existence
was
never
proved
attraction
on
the
contrary
is
a
real
thing
because
its
effects
are
demonstrated
and
the
proportions
of
it
are
calculated
the
cause
of
this
cause
is
among
the
of
the
almighty
precedes
huc
et
non
amplius
thus
far
shalt
thou
go
and
no
farther
letter
on
sir
isaac
newton
optics
the
philosophers
of
the
last
age
found
out
a
new
universe
and
a
circumstance
which
made
its
discovery
more
difficult
was
that
no
one
had
so
much
as
suspected
its
existence
the
most
sage
and
judicious
were
of
opinion
that
it
was
a
frantic
rashness
to
dare
so
much
as
to
imagine
that
it
was
possible
to
guess
the
laws
by
which
the
celestial
bodies
move
and
the
manner
how
light
acts
galileo
by
his
astronomical
discoveries
kepler
by
his
calculation
descartes
at
least
in
his
dioptrics
and
sir
isaac
newton
in
all
his
works
severally
saw
the
mechanism
of
the
springs
of
the
world
the
geometricians
have
subjected
infinity
to
the
laws
of
calculation
the
circulation
of
the
blood
in
animals
and
of
the
sap
in
vegetables
have
changed
the
face
of
nature
with
regard
to
us
a
new
kind
of
existence
has
been
given
to
bodies
in
the
by
the
assistance
of
telescopes
bodies
have
been
brought
nearer
to
one
another
finally
the
several
discoveries
which
sir
isaac
newton
has
made
on
light
are
equal
to
the
boldest
things
which
the
curiosity
of
man
could
expect
after
so
many
philosophical
novelties
till
antonio
de
dominis
the
rainbow
was
considered
as
an
inexplicable
miracle
this
philosopher
guessed
that
it
was
a
necessary
effect
of
the
sun
and
rain
descartes
gained
immortal
fame
by
his
mathematical
explication
of
this
so
natural
a
phenomenon
he
calculated
the
reflections
and
refractions
of
light
in
drops
of
rain
and
his
sagacity
on
this
occasion
was
at
that
time
looked
upon
as
next
to
divine
but
what
would
he
have
said
had
it
been
proved
to
him
that
he
was
mistaken
in
the
nature
of
light
that
he
had
not
the
least
reason
to
maintain
that
it
is
a
globular
body
that
it
is
false
to
assert
that
this
matter
spreading
itself
through
the
whole
waits
only
to
be
projected
forward
by
the
sun
in
order
to
be
put
in
action
in
like
manner
as
a
long
staff
acts
at
one
end
when
pushed
forward
by
the
other
that
light
is
certainly
darted
by
the
sun
in
fine
that
light
is
transmitted
from
the
sun
to
the
earth
in
about
seven
minutes
though
a
cannonball
which
were
not
to
lose
any
of
its
velocity
could
not
go
that
distance
in
less
than
years
how
great
would
have
been
his
astonishment
had
he
been
told
that
light
does
not
reflect
directly
by
impinging
against
the
solid
parts
of
bodies
that
bodies
are
not
transparent
when
they
have
large
pores
and
that
a
man
should
arise
who
would
demonstrate
all
these
paradoxes
and
anatomise
a
single
ray
of
light
with
more
dexterity
than
the
ablest
artist
dissects
a
human
body
this
man
is
come
sir
isaac
newton
has
demonstrated
to
the
eye
by
the
bare
assistance
of
the
prism
that
light
is
a
composition
of
coloured
rays
which
being
united
form
white
colour
a
single
ray
is
by
him
divided
into
seven
which
all
fall
upon
a
piece
of
linen
or
a
sheet
of
white
paper
in
their
order
one
above
the
other
and
at
unequal
distances
the
first
is
red
the
second
orange
the
third
yellow
the
fourth
green
the
fifth
blue
the
sixth
indigo
the
seventh
a
each
of
these
rays
transmitted
afterwards
by
a
hundred
other
prisms
will
never
change
the
colour
it
bears
in
like
manner
as
gold
when
completely
purged
from
its
dross
will
never
change
afterwards
in
the
crucible
as
a
superabundant
proof
that
each
of
these
elementary
rays
has
inherently
in
itself
that
which
forms
its
colour
to
the
eye
take
a
small
piece
of
yellow
wood
for
instance
and
set
it
in
the
ray
of
a
red
colour
this
wood
will
instantly
be
tinged
red
but
set
it
in
the
ray
of
a
green
colour
it
assumes
a
green
colour
and
so
of
all
the
rest
from
what
cause
therefore
do
colours
arise
in
nature
it
is
nothing
but
the
disposition
of
bodies
to
reflect
the
rays
of
a
certain
order
and
to
absorb
all
the
rest
what
then
is
this
secret
disposition
sir
isaac
newton
demonstrates
that
it
is
nothing
more
than
the
density
of
the
small
constituent
particles
of
which
a
body
is
composed
and
how
is
this
reflection
performed
it
was
supposed
to
arise
from
the
rebounding
of
the
rays
in
the
same
manner
as
a
ball
on
the
surface
of
a
solid
body
but
this
is
a
mistake
for
sir
isaac
taught
the
astonished
philosophers
that
bodies
are
opaque
for
no
other
reason
but
because
their
pores
are
large
that
light
reflects
on
our
eyes
from
the
very
bosom
of
those
pores
that
the
smaller
the
pores
of
a
body
are
the
more
such
a
body
is
transparent
thus
paper
which
reflects
the
light
when
dry
transmits
it
when
oiled
because
the
oil
by
filling
its
pores
makes
them
much
smaller
it
is
there
that
examining
the
vast
porosity
of
bodies
every
particle
having
its
pores
and
every
particle
of
those
particles
having
its
own
he
shows
we
are
not
certain
that
there
is
a
cubic
inch
of
solid
matter
in
the
universe
so
far
are
we
from
conceiving
what
matter
is
having
thus
divided
as
it
were
light
into
its
elements
and
carried
the
sagacity
of
his
discoveries
so
far
as
to
prove
the
method
of
distinguishing
compound
colours
from
such
as
are
primitive
he
shows
that
these
elementary
rays
separated
by
the
prism
are
ranged
in
their
order
for
no
other
reason
but
because
they
are
refracted
in
that
very
order
and
it
is
this
property
unknown
till
he
discovered
it
of
breaking
or
splitting
in
this
proportion
it
is
this
unequal
refraction
of
rays
this
power
of
refracting
the
red
less
than
the
orange
colour
which
he
calls
the
different
refrangibility
the
most
reflexible
rays
are
the
most
refrangible
and
from
hence
he
evinces
that
the
same
power
is
the
cause
both
of
the
reflection
and
refraction
of
light
but
all
these
wonders
are
merely
but
the
opening
of
his
discoveries
he
found
out
the
secret
to
see
the
vibrations
or
fits
of
light
which
come
and
go
incessantly
and
which
either
transmit
light
or
reflect
it
according
to
the
density
of
the
parts
they
meet
with
he
has
presumed
to
calculate
the
density
of
the
particles
of
air
necessary
between
two
glasses
the
one
flat
the
other
convex
on
one
side
set
one
upon
the
other
in
order
to
operate
such
a
transmission
or
reflection
or
to
form
such
and
such
a
colour
from
all
these
combinations
he
discovers
the
proportion
in
which
light
acts
on
bodies
and
bodies
act
on
light
he
saw
light
so
perfectly
that
he
has
determined
to
what
degree
of
perfection
the
art
of
increasing
it
and
of
assisting
our
eyes
by
telescopes
can
be
carried
descartes
from
a
noble
confidence
that
was
very
excusable
considering
how
strongly
he
was
fired
at
the
first
discoveries
he
made
in
an
art
which
he
almost
first
found
out
descartes
i
say
hoped
to
discover
in
the
stars
by
the
assistance
of
telescopes
objects
as
small
as
those
we
discern
upon
the
earth
but
sir
isaac
has
shown
that
dioptric
telescopes
can
not
be
brought
to
a
greater
perfection
because
of
that
refraction
and
of
that
very
refrangibility
which
at
the
same
time
that
they
bring
objects
nearer
to
us
scatter
too
much
the
elementary
rays
he
has
calculated
in
these
glasses
the
proportion
of
the
scattering
of
the
red
and
of
the
blue
rays
and
proceeding
so
far
as
to
demonstrate
things
which
were
not
supposed
even
to
exist
he
examines
the
inequalities
which
arise
from
the
shape
or
figure
of
the
glass
and
that
which
arises
from
the
refrangibility
he
finds
that
the
object
glass
of
the
telescope
being
convex
on
one
side
and
flat
on
the
other
in
case
the
flat
side
be
turned
towards
the
object
the
error
which
arises
from
the
construction
and
position
of
the
glass
is
above
five
thousand
times
less
than
the
error
which
arises
from
the
refrangibility
and
therefore
that
the
shape
or
figure
of
the
glasses
is
not
the
cause
why
telescopes
can
not
be
carried
to
a
greater
perfection
but
arises
wholly
from
the
nature
of
light
for
this
reason
he
invented
a
telescope
which
discovers
objects
by
reflection
and
not
by
refraction
telescopes
of
this
new
kind
are
very
hard
to
make
and
their
use
is
not
easy
but
according
to
the
english
a
reflective
telescope
of
but
five
feet
has
the
same
effect
as
another
of
a
hundred
feet
in
length
letter
on
infinites
in

and
sir
isaac
newton
chronology
the
labyrinth
and
abyss
of
infinity
is
also
a
new
course
sir
isaac
newton
has
gone
through
and
we
are
obliged
to
him
for
the
clue
by
whose
assistance
we
are
enabled
to
trace
its
various
windings
descartes
got
the
start
of
him
also
in
this
astonishing
invention
he
advanced
with
mighty
steps
in
his
geometry
and
was
arrived
at
the
very
borders
of
infinity
but
went
no
farther
wallis
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
was
the
first
who
reduced
a
fraction
by
a
perpetual
division
to
an
infinite
series
the
lord
brouncker
employed
this
series
to
square
the
hyperbola
mercator
published
a
demonstration
of
this
quadrature
much
about
which
time
sir
isaac
newton
being
then
years
of
age
had
invented
a
general
method
to
perform
on
all
geometrical
curves
what
had
just
before
been
tried
on
the
hyperbola
it
is
to
this
method
of
subjecting
everywhere
infinity
to
algebraical
calculations
that
the
name
is
given
of
differential
calculations
or
of
fluxions
and
integral
calculation
it
is
the
art
of
numbering
and
measuring
exactly
a
thing
whose
existence
can
not
be
conceived
and
indeed
would
you
not
imagine
that
a
man
laughed
at
you
who
should
declare
that
there
are
lines
infinitely
great
which
form
an
angle
infinitely
little
that
a
right
line
which
is
a
right
line
so
long
as
it
is
finite
by
changing
infinitely
little
its
direction
becomes
an
infinite
curve
and
that
a
curve
may
become
infinitely
less
than
another
curve
that
there
are
infinite
squares
infinite
cubes
and
infinites
of
infinites
all
greater
than
one
another
and
the
last
but
one
of
which
is
nothing
in
comparison
of
the
last
all
these
things
which
at
first
appear
to
be
the
utmost
excess
of
frenzy
are
in
reality
an
effort
of
the
subtlety
and
extent
of
the
human
mind
and
the
art
of
finding
truths
which
till
then
had
been
unknown
this
so
bold
edifice
is
even
founded
on
simple
ideas
the
business
is
to
measure
the
diagonal
of
a
square
to
give
the
area
of
a
curve
to
find
the
square
root
of
a
number
which
has
none
in
common
arithmetic
after
all
the
imagination
ought
not
to
be
startled
any
more
at
so
many
orders
of
infinites
than
at
the
so
proposition
that
curve
lines
may
always
be
made
to
pass
between
a
circle
and
a
tangent
or
at
that
other
namely
that
matter
is
divisible
in
these
two
truths
have
been
demonstrated
many
years
and
are
no
less
incomprehensible
than
the
things
we
have
been
speaking
of
for
many
years
the
invention
of
this
famous
calculation
was
denied
to
sir
isaac
newton
in
germany
leibnitz
was
considered
as
the
inventor
of
the
differences
or
moments
called
fluxions
and
bernouilli
claimed
the
integral
calculus
however
sir
isaac
is
now
thought
to
have
first
made
the
discovery
and
the
other
two
have
the
glory
of
having
once
made
the
world
doubt
whether
it
was
to
be
ascribed
to
him
or
them
thus
some
contested
with
harvey
the
invention
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
as
others
disputed
with
perrault
that
of
the
circulation
of
the
sap
hartsocher
and
leuwenhoek
disputed
with
each
other
the
honour
of
having
first
seen
the
of
which
mankind
are
formed
this
hartsocher
also
contested
with
huygens
the
invention
of
a
new
method
of
calculating
the
distance
of
a
fixed
star
it
is
not
yet
known
to
what
philosopher
we
owe
the
invention
of
the
cycloid
be
this
as
it
will
it
is
by
the
help
of
this
geometry
of
infinites
that
sir
isaac
newton
attained
to
the
most
sublime
discoveries
i
am
now
to
speak
of
another
work
which
though
more
adapted
to
the
capacity
of
the
human
mind
does
nevertheless
display
some
marks
of
that
creative
genius
with
which
sir
isaac
newton
was
informed
in
all
his
researches
the
work
i
mean
is
a
chronology
of
a
new
kind
for
what
province
soever
he
undertook
he
was
sure
to
change
the
ideas
and
opinions
received
by
the
rest
of
men
accustomed
to
unravel
and
disentangle
chaos
he
was
resolved
to
convey
at
least
some
light
into
that
of
the
fables
of
antiquity
which
are
blended
and
confounded
with
history
and
fix
an
uncertain
chronology
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
family
city
or
nation
but
endeavours
to
remove
its
original
as
far
backward
as
possible
besides
the
first
historians
were
the
most
negligent
in
setting
down
the
eras
books
were
infinitely
less
common
than
they
are
at
this
time
and
consequently
authors
being
not
so
obnoxious
to
censure
they
therefore
imposed
upon
the
world
with
greater
impunity
and
as
it
is
evident
that
these
have
related
a
great
number
of
fictitious
particulars
it
is
probable
enough
that
they
also
gave
us
several
false
eras
it
appeared
in
general
to
sir
isaac
that
the
world
was
five
hundred
years
younger
than
chronologers
declare
it
to
be
he
grounds
his
opinion
on
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
and
on
the
observations
which
astronomers
have
made
by
the
course
of
nature
we
here
understand
the
time
that
every
generation
of
men
lives
upon
the
earth
the
egyptians
first
employed
this
vague
and
uncertain
method
of
calculating
when
they
began
to
write
the
beginning
of
their
history
these
computed
three
hundred
and
generations
from
menes
to
sethon
and
having
no
fixed
era
they
supposed
three
generations
to
consist
of
a
hundred
years
in
this
manner
they
computed
eleven
thousand
three
hundred
and
forty
years
from
menes
reign
to
that
of
sethon
the
greeks
before
they
counted
by
olympiads
followed
the
method
of
the
egyptians
and
even
gave
a
little
more
extent
to
generations
making
each
to
consist
of
forty
years
now
here
both
the
egyptians
and
the
greeks
made
an
erroneous
computation
it
is
true
indeed
that
according
to
the
usual
course
of
nature
three
generations
last
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
but
three
reigns
are
far
from
taking
up
so
many
it
is
very
evident
that
mankind
in
general
live
longer
than
kings
are
found
to
reign
so
that
an
author
who
should
write
a
history
in
which
there
were
no
dates
fixed
and
should
know
that
nine
kings
had
reigned
over
a
nation
such
an
historian
would
commit
a
great
error
should
he
allow
three
hundred
years
to
these
nine
monarchs
every
generation
takes
about
years
every
reign
is
one
with
the
other
about
twenty
thirty
kings
of
england
have
swayed
the
sceptre
from
william
the
conqueror
to
george
the
years
of
whose
reigns
added
together
amount
to
six
hundred
and
years
which
being
divided
equally
among
the
thirty
kings
give
to
every
one
a
reign
of
years
and
a
half
very
near
kings
of
france
have
sat
upon
the
throne
these
have
one
with
another
reigned
about
twenty
years
each
this
is
the
usual
course
of
nature
the
ancients
therefore
were
mistaken
when
they
supposed
the
durations
in
general
of
reigns
to
equal
that
of
generations
they
therefore
allowed
too
great
a
number
of
years
and
consequently
some
years
must
be
subtracted
from
their
computation
astronomical
observations
seem
to
have
lent
a
still
greater
assistance
to
our
philosopher
he
appears
to
us
stronger
when
he
fights
upon
his
own
ground
you
know
that
the
earth
besides
its
annual
motion
which
carries
it
round
the
sun
from
west
to
east
in
the
space
of
a
year
has
also
a
singular
revolution
which
was
quite
unknown
till
within
these
late
years
its
poles
have
a
very
slow
retrograde
motion
from
east
to
west
whence
it
happens
that
their
position
every
day
does
not
correspond
exactly
with
the
same
point
of
the
heavens
this
difference
which
is
so
insensible
in
a
year
becomes
pretty
considerable
in
time
and
in
threescore
and
twelve
years
the
difference
is
found
to
be
of
one
degree
that
is
to
say
the
three
hundred
and
sixtieth
part
of
the
circumference
of
the
whole
heaven
thus
after
years
the
colure
of
the
vernal
equinox
which
passed
through
a
fixed
star
corresponds
with
another
fixed
star
hence
it
is
that
the
sun
instead
of
being
in
that
part
of
the
heavens
in
which
the
ram
was
situated
in
the
time
of
hipparchus
is
found
to
correspond
with
that
part
of
the
heavens
in
which
the
bull
was
situated
and
the
twins
are
placed
where
the
bull
then
stood
all
the
signs
have
changed
their
situation
and
yet
we
still
retain
the
same
manner
of
speaking
as
the
ancients
did
in
this
age
we
say
that
the
sun
is
in
the
ram
in
the
spring
from
the
same
principle
of
condescension
that
we
say
that
the
sun
turns
round
hipparchus
was
the
first
among
the
greeks
who
observed
some
change
in
the
constellations
with
regard
to
the
equinoxes
or
rather
who
learnt
it
from
the
egyptians
philosophers
ascribed
this
motion
to
the
stars
for
in
those
ages
people
were
far
from
imagining
such
a
revolution
in
the
earth
which
was
supposed
to
be
immovable
in
every
respect
they
therefore
created
a
heaven
in
which
they
fixed
the
several
stars
and
gave
this
heaven
a
particular
motion
by
which
it
was
carried
towards
the
east
whilst
that
all
the
stars
seemed
to
perform
their
diurnal
revolution
from
east
to
west
to
this
error
they
added
a
second
of
much
greater
consequence
by
imagining
that
the
pretended
heaven
of
the
fixed
stars
advanced
one
degree
eastward
every
hundred
years
in
this
manner
they
were
no
less
mistaken
in
their
astronomical
calculation
than
in
their
system
of
natural
philosophy
as
for
instance
an
astronomer
in
that
age
would
have
said
that
the
vernal
equinox
was
in
the
time
of
such
and
such
an
observation
in
such
a
sign
and
in
such
a
star
it
has
advanced
two
degrees
of
each
since
the
time
that
observation
was
made
to
the
present
now
two
degrees
are
equivalent
to
two
hundred
years
consequently
the
astronomer
who
made
that
observation
lived
just
so
many
years
before
me
it
is
certain
that
an
astronomer
who
had
argued
in
this
manner
would
have
mistook
just
years
hence
it
is
that
the
ancients
who
were
doubly
deceived
made
their
great
year
of
the
world
that
is
the
revolution
of
the
whole
heavens
to
consist
of
thousand
years
but
the
moderns
are
sensible
that
this
imaginary
revolution
of
the
heaven
of
the
stars
is
nothing
else
than
the
revolution
of
the
poles
of
the
earth
which
is
performed
in
thousand
nine
hundred
years
it
may
be
proper
to
observe
transiently
in
this
place
that
sir
isaac
by
determining
the
figure
of
the
earth
has
very
happily
explained
the
cause
of
this
revolution
all
this
being
laid
down
the
only
thing
remaining
to
settle
chronology
is
to
see
through
what
star
the
colure
of
the
equinoxes
passes
and
where
it
intersects
at
this
time
the
ecliptic
in
the
spring
and
to
discover
whether
some
ancient
writer
does
not
tell
us
in
what
point
the
ecliptic
was
intersected
in
his
time
by
the
same
colure
of
the
equinoxes
clemens
alexandrinus
informs
us
that
chiron
who
went
with
the
argonauts
observed
the
constellations
at
the
time
of
that
famous
expedition
and
fixed
the
vernal
equinox
to
the
middle
of
the
ram
the
autumnal
equinox
to
the
middle
of
libra
our
summer
solstice
to
the
middle
of
cancer
and
our
winter
solstice
to
the
middle
of
capricorn
a
long
time
after
the
expedition
of
the
argonauts
and
a
year
before
the
peloponnesian
war
methon
observed
that
the
point
of
the
summer
solstice
passed
through
the
eighth
degree
of
cancer
now
every
sign
of
the
zodiac
contains
thirty
degrees
in
chiron
time
the
solstice
was
arrived
at
the
middle
of
the
sign
that
is
to
say
to
the
fifteenth
degree
a
year
before
the
peloponnesian
war
it
was
at
the
eighth
and
therefore
it
had
retarded
seven
degrees
a
degree
is
equivalent
to
years
consequently
from
the
beginning
of
the
peloponnesian
war
to
the
expedition
of
the
argonauts
there
is
no
more
than
an
interval
of
seven
times
years
which
make
five
hundred
and
four
years
and
not
seven
hundred
years
as
the
greeks
computed
thus
in
comparing
the
position
of
the
heavens
at
this
time
with
their
position
in
that
age
we
find
that
the
expedition
of
the
argonauts
ought
to
be
placed
about
nine
hundred
years
before
christ
and
not
about
fourteen
hundred
and
consequently
that
the
world
is
not
so
old
by
five
hundred
years
as
it
was
generally
supposed
to
be
by
this
calculation
all
the
eras
are
drawn
nearer
and
the
several
events
are
found
to
have
happened
later
than
is
computed
i
do
not
know
whether
this
ingenious
system
will
be
favourably
received
and
whether
these
notions
will
prevail
so
far
with
the
learned
as
to
prompt
them
to
reform
the
chronology
of
the
world
perhaps
these
gentlemen
would
think
it
too
great
a
condescension
to
allow
one
and
the
same
man
the
glory
of
having
improved
natural
philosophy
geometry
and
history
this
would
be
a
kind
of
universal
monarchy
with
which
the
principle
of
that
is
in
man
will
scarce
suffer
him
to
indulge
his
and
indeed
at
the
same
time
that
some
very
great
philosophers
attacked
sir
isaac
newton
attractive
principle
others
fell
upon
his
chronological
system
time
that
should
discover
to
which
of
these
the
victory
is
due
may
perhaps
only
leave
the
dispute
still
more
undetermined
letter
on
tragedy
the
english
as
well
as
the
spaniards
were
possessed
of
theatres
at
a
time
when
the
french
had
no
more
than
moving
itinerant
stages
shakspeare
who
was
considered
as
the
corneille
of
the
nation
was
pretty
nearly
contemporary
with
lopez
de
vega
and
he
created
as
it
were
the
english
theatre
shakspeare
boasted
a
strong
fruitful
genius
he
was
natural
and
sublime
but
had
not
so
much
as
a
single
spark
of
good
taste
or
knew
one
rule
of
the
drama
i
will
now
hazard
a
random
but
at
the
same
time
true
reflection
which
is
that
the
great
merit
of
this
dramatic
poet
has
been
the
ruin
of
the
english
stage
there
are
such
beautiful
such
noble
such
dreadful
scenes
in
this
writer
monstrous
farces
to
which
the
name
of
tragedy
is
given
that
they
have
always
been
exhibited
with
great
success
time
which
alone
gives
reputation
to
writers
at
last
makes
their
very
faults
venerable
most
of
the
whimsical
gigantic
images
of
this
poet
have
through
length
of
time
it
being
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
since
they
were
first
drawn
acquired
a
right
of
passing
for
sublime
most
of
the
modern
dramatic
writers
have
copied
him
but
the
touches
and
descriptions
which
are
applauded
in
shakspeare
are
hissed
at
in
these
writers
and
you
will
easily
believe
that
the
veneration
in
which
this
author
is
held
increases
in
proportion
to
the
contempt
which
is
shown
to
the
moderns
dramatic
writers
consider
that
they
should
not
imitate
him
and
the
of
shakspeare
imitators
produces
no
other
effect
than
to
make
him
be
considered
as
inimitable
you
remember
that
in
the
tragedy
of
moor
of
a
most
tender
piece
a
man
strangles
his
wife
on
the
stage
and
that
the
poor
woman
whilst
she
is
strangling
cries
aloud
that
she
dies
very
unjustly
you
know
that
in
prince
of
two
make
a
grave
and
are
all
the
time
drinking
singing
ballads
and
making
humorous
reflections
natural
indeed
enough
to
persons
of
their
profession
on
the
several
skulls
they
throw
up
with
their
spades
but
a
circumstance
which
will
surprise
you
is
that
this
ridiculous
incident
has
been
imitated
in
the
reign
of
king
charles
which
was
that
of
politeness
and
the
golden
age
of
the
liberal
arts
otway
in
his
introduces
antonio
the
senator
and
naki
his
courtesan
in
the
midst
of
the
horrors
of
the
marquis
of
bedemar
conspiracy
antonio
the
superannuated
senator
plays
in
his
mistress
presence
all
the
apish
tricks
of
a
lewd
impotent
debauchee
who
is
quite
frantic
and
out
of
his
senses
he
mimics
a
bull
and
a
dog
and
bites
his
mistress
legs
who
kicks
and
whips
him
however
the
players
have
struck
these
buffooneries
which
indeed
were
calculated
merely
for
the
dregs
of
the
people
out
of
otway
tragedy
but
they
have
still
left
in
shakspeare
the
jokes
of
the
roman
shoemakers
and
cobblers
who
are
introduced
in
the
same
scene
with
brutus
and
cassius
you
will
undoubtedly
complain
that
those
who
have
hitherto
discoursed
with
you
on
the
english
stage
and
especially
on
the
celebrated
shakspeare
have
taken
notice
only
of
his
errors
and
that
no
one
has
translated
any
of
those
strong
those
forcible
passages
which
atone
for
all
his
faults
but
to
this
i
will
answer
that
nothing
is
easier
than
to
exhibit
in
prose
all
the
silly
impertinences
which
a
poet
may
have
thrown
out
but
that
it
is
a
very
difficult
task
to
translate
his
fine
verses
all
your
junior
academical
sophs
who
set
up
for
censors
of
the
eminent
writers
compile
whole
volumes
but
methinks
two
pages
which
display
some
of
the
beauties
of
great
geniuses
are
of
infinitely
more
value
than
all
the
idle
rhapsodies
of
those
commentators
and
i
will
join
in
opinion
with
all
persons
of
good
taste
in
declaring
that
greater
advantage
may
be
reaped
from
a
dozen
verses
of
homer
of
virgil
than
from
all
the
critiques
put
together
which
have
been
made
on
those
two
great
poets
i
have
ventured
to
translate
some
passages
of
the
most
celebrated
english
poets
and
shall
now
give
you
one
from
shakspeare
pardon
the
blemishes
of
the
translation
for
the
sake
of
the
original
and
remember
always
that
when
you
see
a
version
you
see
merely
a
faint
print
of
a
beautiful
picture
i
have
made
choice
of
part
of
the
celebrated
soliloquy
in
which
you
may
remember
is
as
follows
to
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question
whether
is
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
or
to
take
arms
against
a
sea
of
troubles
and
by
opposing
end
them
to
die
to
sleep
no
more
and
by
a
sleep
to
say
we
end
the
and
the
thousand
natural
shocks
that
flesh
is
heir
to
is
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
to
die
to
sleep
to
sleep
perchance
to
dream
o
there
the
rub
for
in
that
sleep
of
death
what
dreams
may
come
when
we
have
shuffled
off
this
mortal
coil
must
give
us
pause
there
the
respect
that
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
for
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
the
oppressor
wrong
the
poor
man
contumely
the
pangs
of
despised
love
the
law
delay
the
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
that
patient
merit
of
the
unworthy
takes
when
he
himself
might
his
quietus
make
with
a
bare
bodkin
who
would
fardels
bear
to
groan
and
sweat
under
a
weary
life
but
that
the
dread
of
something
after
death
the
undiscovered
country
from
whose
bourn
no
traveller
returns
puzzles
the
will
and
makes
us
rather
bear
those
ills
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
thus
conscience
does
make
cowards
of
us
all
and
thus
the
native
hue
of
resolution
is
sicklied
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
and
enterprises
of
great
weight
and
moment
with
this
regard
their
currents
turn
awry
and
lose
the

it

in

manner
woe
to
the
writer
who
gives
a
literal
version
who
by
rendering
every
word
of
his
original
by
that
very
means
enervates
the
sense
and
extinguishes
all
the
fire
of
it
it
is
on
such
an
occasion
one
may
justly
affirm
that
the
letter
kills
but
the
spirit
quickens
here
follows
another
passage
copied
from
a
celebrated
tragic
writer
among
the
english
it
is
dryden
a
poet
in
the
reign
of
charles
a
writer
whose
genius
was
too
exuberant
and
not
accompanied
with
judgment
enough
had
he
written
only
a
tenth
part
of
the
works
he
left
behind
him
his
character
would
have
been
conspicuous
in
every
part
but
his
great
fault
is
his
having
endeavoured
to
be
universal
the
passage
in
question
is
as
follows
when
i
consider
life
is
all
a
cheat
yet
fooled
by
hope
men
favour
the
deceit
trust
on
and
think
will
repay
falser
than
the
former
day
lies
more
and
whilst
it
says
we
shall
be
blest
with
some
new
joy
cuts
off
what
we
possessed
strange
cozenage
none
would
live
past
years
again
yet
all
hope
pleasure
in
what
yet
remain
and
from
the
dregs
of
life
think
to
receive
what
the
first
sprightly
running
could
not
give
i
tired
with
waiting
for
this
chymic
gold
which
fools
us
young
and
beggars
us
when

i
shall
now

it
is
in
these
detached
passages
that
the
english
have
hitherto
excelled
their
dramatic
pieces
most
of
which
are
barbarous
and
without
decorum
order
or
verisimilitude
dart
such
resplendent
flashes
through
this
gleam
as
amaze
and
astonish
the
style
is
too
much
inflated
too
unnatural
too
closely
copied
from
the
hebrew
writers
who
abound
so
much
with
the
asiatic
fustian
but
then
it
must
be
also
confessed
that
the
stilts
of
the
figurative
style
on
which
the
english
tongue
is
lifted
up
raises
the
genius
at
the
same
time
very
far
aloft
though
with
an
irregular
pace
the
first
english
writer
who
composed
a
regular
tragedy
and
infused
a
spirit
of
elegance
through
every
part
of
it
was
the
illustrious
addison
his
cato
is
a
masterpiece
both
with
regard
to
the
diction
and
to
the
beauty
and
harmony
of
the
numbers
the
character
of
cato
is
in
my
opinion
vastly
superior
to
that
of
cornelia
in
the
pompey
of
corneille
for
cato
is
great
without
anything
like
fustian
and
cornelia
who
besides
is
not
a
necessary
character
tends
sometimes
to
bombast
addison
cato
appears
to
me
the
greatest
character
that
was
ever
brought
upon
any
stage
but
then
the
rest
of
them
do
not
correspond
to
the
dignity
of
it
and
this
dramatic
piece
so
excellently
well
writ
is
disfigured
by
a
dull
love
plot
which
spreads
a
certain
languor
over
the
whole
that
quite
murders
it
the
custom
of
introducing
love
at
random
and
at
any
rate
in
the
drama
passed
from
paris
to
london
about
with
our
ribbons
and
our
perruques
the
ladies
who
adorn
the
theatrical
circle
there
in
like
manner
as
in
this
city
will
suffer
love
only
to
be
the
theme
of
every
conversation
the
judicious
addison
had
the
effeminate
complaisance
to
soften
the
severity
of
his
dramatic
character
so
as
to
adapt
it
to
the
manners
of
the
age
and
from
an
endeavour
to
please
quite
ruined
a
masterpiece
in
its
kind
since
his
time
the
drama
is
become
more
regular
the
audience
more
difficult
to
be
pleased
and
writers
more
correct
and
less
bold
i
have
seen
some
new
pieces
that
were
written
with
great
regularity
but
which
at
the
same
time
were
very
flat
and
insipid
one
would
think
that
the
english
had
been
hitherto
formed
to
produce
irregular
beauties
only
the
shining
monsters
of
shakspeare
give
infinite
more
delight
than
the
judicious
images
of
the
moderns
hitherto
the
poetical
genius
of
the
english
resembles
a
tufted
tree
planted
by
the
hand
of
nature
that
throws
out
a
thousand
branches
at
random
and
spreads
unequally
but
with
great
vigour
it
dies
if
you
attempt
to
force
its
nature
and
to
lop
and
dress
it
in
the
same
manner
as
the
trees
of
the
garden
of
marli
letter
on
comedy
i
am
surprised
that
the
judicious
and
ingenious
de
muralt
who
has
published
some
letters
on
the
english
and
french
nations
should
have
confined
himself
in
treating
of
comedy
merely
to
censure
shadwell
the
comic
writer
this
author
was
had
in
pretty
great
contempt
in
de
muralt
time
and
was
not
the
poet
of
the
polite
part
of
the
nation
his
dramatic
pieces
which
pleased
some
time
in
acting
were
despised
by
all
persons
of
taste
and
might
be
compared
to
many
plays
which
i
have
seen
in
france
that
drew
crowds
to
the
playhouse
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
intolerable
to
read
and
of
which
it
might
be
said
that
the
whole
city
of
paris
exploded
them
and
yet
all
flocked
to
see
them
represented
on
the
stage
methinks
de
muralt
should
have
mentioned
an
excellent
comic
writer
living
when
he
was
in
england
i
mean
wycherley
who
was
a
long
time
known
publicly
to
be
happy
in
the
good
graces
of
the
most
celebrated
mistress
of
king
charles
ii
this
gentleman
who
passed
his
life
among
persons
of
the
highest
distinction
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
their
lives
and
their
follies
and
painted
them
with
the
strongest
pencil
and
in
the
truest
colours
he
has
drawn
a
misanthrope
or
in
imitation
of
that
of
moliere
all
wycherley
strokes
are
stronger
and
bolder
than
those
of
our
misanthrope
but
then
they
are
less
delicate
and
the
rules
of
decorum
are
not
so
well
observed
in
this
play
the
english
writer
has
corrected
the
only
defect
that
is
in
moliere
comedy
the
thinness
of
the
plot
which
also
is
so
disposed
that
the
characters
in
it
do
not
enough
raise
our
concern
the
english
comedy
affects
us
and
the
contrivance
of
the
plot
is
very
ingenious
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
too
bold
for
the
french
manners
the
fable
is
this
a
captain
of
a
who
is
very
brave
and
inflamed
with
a
spirit
of
contempt
for
all
mankind
has
a
prudent
sincere
friend
whom
he
yet
is
suspicious
of
and
a
mistress
that
loves
him
with
the
utmost
excess
of
passion
the
captain
so
far
from
returning
her
love
will
not
even
condescend
to
look
upon
her
but
confides
entirely
in
a
false
friend
who
is
the
most
worthless
wretch
living
at
the
same
time
he
has
given
his
heart
to
a
creature
who
is
the
greatest
coquette
and
the
most
perfidious
of
her
sex
and
he
is
so
credulous
as
to
be
confident
she
is
a
penelope
and
his
false
friend
a
cato
he
embarks
on
board
his
ship
in
order
to
go
and
fight
the
dutch
having
left
all
his
money
his
jewels
and
everything
he
had
in
the
world
to
this
virtuous
creature
whom
at
the
same
time
he
recommends
to
the
care
of
his
supposed
faithful
friend
nevertheless
the
real
man
of
honour
whom
he
suspects
so
unaccountably
goes
on
board
the
ship
with
him
and
the
mistress
on
whom
he
would
not
bestow
so
much
as
one
glance
disguises
herself
in
the
habit
of
a
page
and
is
with
him
the
whole
voyage
without
his
once
knowing
that
she
is
of
a
sex
different
from
that
she
attempts
to
pass
for
which
by
the
way
is
not
over
natural
the
captain
having
blown
up
his
own
ship
in
an
engagement
returns
to
england
abandoned
and
undone
accompanied
by
his
page
and
his
friend
without
knowing
the
friendship
of
the
one
or
the
tender
passion
of
the
other
immediately
he
goes
to
the
jewel
among
women
who
he
expected
had
preserved
her
fidelity
to
him
and
the
treasure
he
had
left
in
her
hands
he
meets
with
her
indeed
but
married
to
the
honest
knave
in
whom
he
had
reposed
so
much
confidence
and
finds
she
had
acted
as
treacherously
with
regard
to
the
casket
he
had
entrusted
her
with
the
captain
can
scarce
think
it
possible
that
a
woman
of
virtue
and
honour
can
act
so
vile
a
part
but
to
convince
him
still
more
of
the
reality
of
it
this
very
worthy
lady
falls
in
love
with
the
little
page
and
will
force
him
to
her
embraces
but
as
it
is
requisite
justice
should
be
done
and
that
in
a
dramatic
piece
virtue
ought
to
be
rewarded
and
vice
punished
it
is
at
last
found
that
the
captain
takes
his
page
place
and
lies
with
his
faithless
mistress
cuckolds
his
treacherous
friend
thrusts
his
sword
through
his
body
recovers
his
casket
and
marries
his
page
you
will
observe
that
this
play
is
also
larded
with
a
petulant
litigious
old
woman
a
relation
of
the
captain
who
is
the
most
comical
character
that
was
ever
brought
upon
the
stage
wycherley
has
also
copied
from
moliere
another
play
of
as
singular
and
bold
a
cast
which
is
a
kind
of
des
or
for
married
the
principal
character
in
this
comedy
is
one
homer
a
sly
fortune
hunter
and
the
terror
of
all
the
city
husbands
this
fellow
in
order
to
play
a
surer
game
causes
a
report
to
be
spread
that
in
his
last
illness
the
surgeons
had
found
it
necessary
to
have
him
made
a
eunuch
upon
his
appearing
in
this
noble
character
all
the
husbands
in
town
flock
to
him
with
their
wives
and
now
poor
homer
is
only
puzzled
about
his
choice
however
he
gives
the
preference
particularly
to
a
little
female
peasant
a
very
harmless
innocent
creature
who
enjoys
a
fine
flush
of
health
and
cuckolds
her
husband
with
a
simplicity
that
has
infinitely
more
merit
than
the
witty
malice
of
the
most
experienced
ladies
this
play
can
not
indeed
be
called
the
school
of
good
morals
but
it
is
certainly
the
school
of
wit
and
true
humour
sir
john
vanbrugh
has
written
several
comedies
which
are
more
humorous
than
those
of
wycherley
but
not
so
ingenious
sir
john
was
a
man
of
pleasure
and
likewise
a
poet
and
an
architect
the
general
opinion
is
that
he
is
as
sprightly
in
his
writings
as
he
is
heavy
in
his
buildings
it
is
he
who
raised
the
famous
castle
of
blenheim
a
ponderous
and
lasting
monument
of
our
unfortunate
battle
of
hochstet
were
the
apartments
but
as
spacious
as
the
walls
are
thick
this
castle
would
be
commodious
enough
some
wag
in
an
epitaph
he
made
on
sir
john
vanbrugh
has
these
lines
earth
lie
light
on
him
for
he
laid
many
a
heavy
load
on
thee
sir
john
having
taken
a
tour
into
france
before
the
glorious
war
that
broke
out
in
was
thrown
into
the
bastille
and
detained
there
for
some
time
without
being
ever
able
to
discover
the
motive
which
had
prompted
our
ministry
to
indulge
him
with
this
mark
of
their
distinction
he
wrote
a
comedy
during
his
confinement
and
a
circumstance
which
appears
to
me
very
extraordinary
is
that
we
do
meet
with
so
much
as
a
single
satirical
stroke
against
the
country
in
which
he
had
been
so
injuriously
treated
the
late
congreve
raised
the
glory
of
comedy
to
a
greater
height
than
any
english
writer
before
or
since
his
time
he
wrote
only
a
few
plays
but
they
are
all
excellent
in
their
kind
the
laws
of
the
drama
are
strictly
observed
in
them
they
abound
with
characters
all
which
are
shadowed
with
the
utmost
delicacy
and
we
do
meet
with
so
much
as
one
low
or
coarse
jest
the
language
is
everywhere
that
of
men
of
honour
but
their
actions
are
those
of
knaves
a
proof
that
he
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
human
nature
and
frequented
what
we
call
polite
company
he
was
infirm
and
come
to
the
verge
of
life
when
i
knew
him
congreve
had
one
defect
which
was
his
entertaining
too
mean
an
idea
of
his
first
profession
that
of
a
writer
though
it
was
to
this
he
owed
his
fame
and
fortune
he
spoke
of
his
works
as
of
trifles
that
were
beneath
him
and
hinted
to
me
in
our
first
conversation
that
i
should
visit
him
upon
no
other
footing
than
that
of
a
gentleman
who
led
a
life
of
plainness
and
simplicity
i
answered
that
had
he
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
a
mere
gentleman
i
should
never
have
come
to
see
him
and
i
was
very
much
disgusted
at
so
unseasonable
a
piece
of
vanity
congreve
comedies
are
the
most
witty
and
regular
those
of
sir
john
vanbrugh
most
gay
and
humorous
and
those
of
wycherley
have
the
greatest
force
and
spirit
it
may
be
proper
to
observe
that
these
fine
geniuses
never
spoke
disadvantageously
of
moliere
and
that
none
but
the
contemptible
writers
among
the
english
have
endeavoured
to
lessen
the
character
of
that
great
comic
poet
such
italian
musicians
as
despise
lully
are
themselves
persons
of
no
character
or
ability
but
a
buononcini
esteems
that
great
artist
and
does
justice
to
his
merit
the
english
have
some
other
good
comic
writers
living
such
as
sir
richard
steele
and
cibber
who
is
an
excellent
player
and
also
poet
laureate
a
title
which
how
ridiculous
soever
it
may
be
thought
is
yet
worth
a
thousand
crowns
a
year
besides
some
considerable
privileges
to
the
person
who
enjoys
it
our
illustrious
corneille
had
not
so
much
to
conclude
do
desire
me
to
descend
to
particulars
with
regard
to
these
english
comedies
which
i
am
so
fond
of
applauding
nor
to
give
you
a
single
smart
saying
or
humorous
stroke
from
wycherley
or
congreve
we
do
laugh
in
rending
a
translation
if
you
have
a
mind
to
understand
the
english
comedy
the
only
way
to
do
this
will
be
for
you
to
go
to
england
to
spend
three
years
in
london
to
make
yourself
master
of
the
english
tongue
and
to
frequent
the
playhouse
every
night
i
receive
but
little
pleasure
from
the
perusal
of
aristophanes
and
plautus
and
for
this
reason
because
i
am
neither
a
greek
nor
a
roman
the
delicacy
of
the
humour
the
allusion
the
all
these
are
lost
to
a
foreigner
but
it
is
different
with
respect
to
tragedy
this
treating
only
of
exalted
passions
and
heroical
follies
which
the
antiquated
errors
of
fable
or
history
have
made
sacred
oedipus
electra
and
characters
may
with
as
much
propriety
be
treated
of
by
the
spaniards
the
english
or
us
as
by
the
greeks
but
true
comedy
is
the
speaking
picture
of
the
follies
and
ridiculous
foibles
of
a
nation
so
that
he
only
is
able
to
judge
of
the
painting
who
is
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
people
it
represents
letter
on
such
of
the
nobility
as
cultivate
the
belles
lettres
there
once
was
a
time
in
france
when
the
polite
arts
were
cultivated
by
persons
of
the
highest
rank
in
the
state
the
courtiers
particularly
were
conversant
in
them
although
indolence
a
taste
for
trifles
and
a
passion
for
intrigue
were
the
divinities
of
the
country
the
court
methinks
at
this
time
seems
to
have
given
into
a
taste
quite
opposite
to
that
of
polite
literature
but
perhaps
the
mode
of
thinking
may
be
revived
in
a
little
time
the
french
are
of
so
flexible
a
disposition
may
be
moulded
into
such
a
variety
of
shapes
that
the
monarch
needs
but
command
and
he
is
immediately
obeyed
the
english
generally
think
and
learning
is
had
in
greater
honour
among
them
than
in
our
country
an
advantage
that
results
naturally
from
the
form
of
their
government
there
are
about
eight
hundred
persons
in
england
who
have
a
right
to
speak
in
public
and
to
support
the
interest
of
the
kingdom
and
near
five
or
six
thousand
may
in
their
turns
aspire
to
the
same
honour
the
whole
nation
set
themselves
up
as
judges
over
these
and
every
man
has
the
liberty
of
publishing
his
thoughts
with
regard
to
public
affairs
which
shows
that
all
the
people
in
general
are
indispensably
obliged
to
cultivate
their
understandings
in
england
the
governments
of
greece
and
rome
are
the
subject
of
every
conversation
so
that
every
man
is
under
a
necessity
of
perusing
such
authors
as
treat
of
them
how
disagreeable
soever
it
may
be
to
him
and
this
study
leads
naturally
to
that
of
polite
literature
mankind
in
general
speak
well
in
their
respective
professions
what
is
the
reason
why
our
magistrates
our
lawyers
our
physicians
and
a
great
number
of
the
clergy
are
abler
scholars
have
a
finer
taste
and
more
wit
than
persons
of
all
other
professions
the
reason
is
because
their
condition
of
life
requires
a
cultivated
and
enlightened
mind
in
the
same
manner
as
a
merchant
is
obliged
to
be
acquainted
with
his
traffic
not
long
since
an
english
nobleman
who
was
very
young
came
to
see
me
at
paris
on
his
return
from
italy
he
had
written
a
poetical
description
of
that
country
which
for
delicacy
and
politeness
may
vie
with
anything
we
meet
with
in
the
earl
of
rochester
or
in
our
chaulieu
our
sarrasin
or
chapelle
the
translation
i
have
given
of
it
is
so
inexpressive
of
the
strength
and
delicate
humour
of
the
original
that
i
am
obliged
seriously
to
ask
pardon
of
the
author
and
of
all
who
understand
english
however
as
this
is
the
only
method
i
have
to
make
his
lordship
verses

i
shall
here
present
you
with
them

letter
on
the
earl
of
rochester
and
waller
the
earl
of
rochester
name
is
universally
known
de
evremont
has
made
very
frequent
mention
of
him
but
then
he
has
represented
this
famous
nobleman
in
no
other
light
than
as
the
man
of
pleasure
as
one
who
was
the
idol
of
the
fair
but
with
regard
to
myself
i
would
willingly
describe
in
him
the
man
of
genius
the
great
poet
among
other
pieces
which
display
the
shining
imagination
his
lordship
only
could
boast
he
wrote
some
satires
on
the
same
subjects
as
those
our
celebrated
boileau
made
choice
of
i
do
not
know
any
better
method
of
improving
the
taste
than
to
compare
the
productions
of
such
great
geniuses
as
have
exercised
their
talent
on
the
same
subject
boileau
declaims
as
follows
against
human

first
desire
you
always
to
remember
that
the
versions

give
you

are

with
freedom
and
latitude

that
the
restraint

the
delicacies
of

will
not
allow

whether

it
is
certain
they
are
expressed
with
an
energy
and
fire
which
form
the
poet
i
shall
be
very
far
from
attempting
to
examine
philosophically
into
these
verses
to
lay
down
the
pencil
and
take
up
the
rule
and
compass
on
this
occasion
my
only
design
in
this
letter
being
to
display
the
genius
of
the
english
poets
and
therefore
i
shall
continue
in
the
same
view
the
celebrated
waller
has
been
very
much
talked
of
in
france
and
de
la
fontaine
evremont
and
bayle
have
written
his
eulogium
but
still
his
name
only
is
known
he
had
much
the
same
reputation
in
london
as
voiture
had
in
paris
and
in
my
opinion
deserved
it
better
voiture
was
born
in
an
age
that
was
just
emerging
from
barbarity
an
age
that
was
still
rude
and
ignorant
the
people
of
which
aimed
at
wit
though
they
had
not
the
least
pretensions
to
it
and
sought
for
points
and
conceits
instead
of
sentiments
bristol
stones
are
more
easily
found
than
diamonds
voiture
born
with
an
easy
and
frivolous
genius
was
the
first
who
shone
in
this
aurora
of
french
literature
had
he
come
into
the
world
after
those
great
geniuses
who
spread
such
a
glory
over
the
age
of
louis
he
would
either
have
been
unknown
would
have
been
despised
or
would
have
corrected
his
style
boileau
applauded
him
but
it
was
in
his
first
satires
at
a
time
when
the
taste
of
that
great
poet
was
not
yet
formed
he
was
young
and
in
an
age
when
persons
form
a
judgment
of
men
from
their
reputation
and
not
from
their
writings
besides
boileau
was
very
partial
both
in
his
encomiums
and
his
censures
he
applauded
segrais
whose
works
nobody
reads
he
abused
quinault
whose
poetical
pieces
every
one
has
got
by
heart
and
is
wholly
silent
upon
la
fontaine
waller
though
a
better
poet
than
voiture
was
not
yet
a
finished
poet
the
graces
breathe
in
such
of
waller
works
as
are
writ
in
a
tender
strain
but
then
they
are
languid
through
negligence
and
often
disfigured
with
false
thoughts
the
english
had
not
in
his
time
attained
the
art
of
correct
writing
but
his
serious
compositions
exhibit
a
strength
and
vigour
which
could
not
have
been
expected
from
the
softness
and
effeminacy
of
his
other
pieces
he
wrote
an
elegy
on
oliver
cromwell
which
with
all
its
faults
is
nevertheless
looked
upon
as
a
masterpiece
to
understand
this
copy
of
verses
you
are
to
know
that
the
day
oliver
died
was
remarkable
for
a
great
storm
his
poem
begins
in
this
manner
il

his
great
soul
does
claim
in
storms
as
loud
as
his
immortal
fame
his
dying
groans
his
last
breath
shakes
our
isle
and
trees
uncut
fall

his
funeral
pile
about

their

so
romulus
was
lost
new
rome
in
such
a
tempest
missed
her
king
and
from
obeying
fell
to
worshipping
on
oeta
top
thus
hercules
lay
dead
with
ruined
oaks
and
pines
about
him
spread
nature
herself
took
notice
of
his
death
and
sighing
swelled
the
sea
with
such
a
breath
that
to
remotest
shores
the
billows
rolled
th
approaching
fate
of
his
great
ruler
told
waller
it
was
this
elogium
that
gave
occasion
to
the
reply
taken
notice
of
in
bayle
dictionary
which
waller
made
to
king
charles
ii
this
king
to
whom
waller
had
a
little
before
as
is
usual
with
bards
and
monarchs
presented
a
copy
of
verses
embroidered
with
praises
reproached
the
poet
for
not
writing
with
so
much
energy
and
fire
as
when
he
had
applauded
the
usurper
meaning
oliver
sir
replied
waller
to
the
king
we
poets
succeed
better
in
fiction
than
in
truth
this
answer
was
not
so
sincere
as
that
which
a
dutch
ambassador
made
who
when
the
same
monarch
complained
that
his
masters
paid
less
regard
to
him
than
they
had
done
to
cromwell
ah
sir
says
the
ambassador
oliver
was
quite
another
man
it
is
not
my
intent
to
give
a
commentary
on
waller
character
nor
on
that
of
any
other
person
for
i
consider
men
after
their
death
in
no
other
light
than
as
they
were
writers
and
wholly
disregard
everything
else
i
shall
only
observe
that
waller
though
born
in
a
court
and
to
an
estate
of
five
or
six
thousand
pounds
sterling
a
year
was
never
so
proud
or
so
indolent
as
to
lay
aside
the
happy
talent
which
nature
had
indulged
him
the
earls
of
dorset
and
roscommon
the
two
dukes
of
buckingham
the
lord
halifax
and
so
many
other
noblemen
did
not
think
the
reputation
they
obtained
of
very
great
poets
and
illustrious
writers
any
way
derogatory
to
their
quality
they
are
more
glorious
for
their
works
than
for
their
titles
these
cultivated
the
polite
arts
with
as
much
assiduity
as
though
they
had
been
their
whole
dependence
they
also
have
made
learning
appear
venerable
in
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
who
have
need
to
be
led
in
all
things
by
the
great
and
who
nevertheless
fashion
their
manners
less
after
those
of
the
nobility
in
england
i
mean
than
in
any
other
country
in
the
world
letter
on
pope
and
some
other
famous
poets
i
intended
to
treat
of
mr
prior
one
of
the
most
amiable
english
poets
whom
you
saw
plenipotentiary
and
envoy
extraordinary
at
paris
in
i
also
designed
to
have
given
you
some
idea
of
the
lord
roscommon
and
the
lord
dorset
muse
but
i
find
that
to
do
this
i
should
be
obliged
to
write
a
large
volume
and
that
after
much
pains
and
trouble
you
would
have
but
an
imperfect
idea
of
all
those
works
poetry
is
a
kind
of
music
in
which
a
man
should
have
some
knowledge
before
he
pretends
to
judge
of
it
when
i
give
you
a
translation
of
some
passages
from
those
foreign
poets
i
only
prick
down
and
that
imperfectly
their
music
but
then
i
can
not
express
the
taste
of
their
harmony
there
is
one
english
poem
especially
which
i
should
despair
of
ever
making
you
understand
the
title
whereof
is
hudibras
the
subject
of
it
is
the
civil
war
in
the
time
of
the
grand
rebellion
and
the
principles
and
practice
of
the
puritans
are
therein
ridiculed
it
is
don
quixote
it
is
our
satire
menippee
blended
together
i
never
found
so
much
wit
in
one
single
book
as
in
that
which
at
the
same
time
is
the
most
difficult
to
be
translated
who
would
believe
that
a
work
which
paints
in
such
lively
and
natural
colours
the
several
foibles
and
follies
of
mankind
and
where
we
meet
with
more
sentiments
than
words
should
baffle
the
endeavours
of
the
ablest
translator
but
the
reason
of
this
is
almost
every
part
of
it
alludes
to
particular
incidents
the
clergy
are
there
made
the
principal
object
of
ridicule
which
is
understood
but
by
few
among
the
laity
to
explain
this
a
commentary
would
be
requisite
and
humour
when
explained
is
no
longer
humour
whoever
sets
up
for
a
commentator
of
smart
sayings
and
repartees
is
himself
a
blockhead
this
is
the
reason
why
the
works
of
the
ingenious
dean
swift
who
has
been
called
the
english
rabelais
will
never
be
well
understood
in
france
this
gentleman
has
the
honour
in
common
with
rabelais
of
being
a
priest
and
like
him
laughs
at
everything
but
in
my
humble
opinion
the
title
of
the
english
rabelais
which
is
given
the
dean
is
highly
derogatory
to
his
genius
the
former
has
interspersed
his
fantastic
and
unintelligible
book
with
the
most
gay
strokes
of
humour
but
which
at
the
same
time
has
a
greater
proportion
of
impertinence
he
has
been
vastly
lavish
of
erudition
of
smut
and
insipid
raillery
an
agreeable
tale
of
two
pages
is
purchased
at
the
expense
of
whole
volumes
of
nonsense
there
are
but
few
persons
and
those
of
a
grotesque
taste
who
pretend
to
understand
and
to
esteem
this
work
for
as
to
the
rest
of
the
nation
they
laugh
at
the
pleasant
and
diverting
touches
which
are
found
in
rabelais
and
despise
his
book
he
is
looked
upon
as
the
prince
of
buffoons
the
readers
are
vexed
to
think
that
a
man
who
was
master
of
so
much
wit
should
have
made
so
wretched
a
use
of
it
he
is
an
intoxicated
philosopher
who
never
wrote
but
when
he
was
in
liquor
dean
swift
is
rabelais
in
his
senses
and
frequenting
the
politest
company
the
former
indeed
is
not
so
gay
as
the
latter
but
then
he
possesses
all
the
delicacy
the
justness
the
choice
the
good
taste
in
all
which
particulars
our
giggling
rural
vicar
rabelais
is
wanting
the
poetical
numbers
of
dean
swift
are
of
a
singular
and
almost
inimitable
taste
true
humour
whether
in
prose
or
verse
seems
to
be
his
peculiar
talent
but
whoever
is
desirous
of
understanding
him
perfectly
must
visit
the
island
in
which
he
was
born
it
will
be
much
easier
for
you
to
form
an
idea
of
pope
works
he
is
in
my
opinion
the
most
elegant
the
most
correct
poet
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
harmonious
a
circumstance
which
redounds
very
much
to
the
honour
of
this
muse
that
england
ever
gave
birth
to
he
has
mellowed
the
harsh
sounds
of
the
english
trumpet
to
the
soft
accents
of
the
flute
his
compositions
may
be
easily
translated
because
they
are
vastly
clear
and
perspicuous
besides
most
of
his
subjects
are
general
and
relative
to
all
nations
his
essay
on
criticism
will
soon
be
known
in
france
by
the
translation
which
de
resnel
has
made
of
it
here
is
an
extract
from
his
poem
entitled
the
rape
of
the
lock
which
i
just
now
translated
with
the
latitude
i
usually
take
on
these
occasions
for
once
again
nothing
can
be

to

this
extract
in
the
original
not
in
the
faint
translation
i
have
given
you
of
it
may
be
compared
to
the
description
of
softness
or
effeminacy
in
boileau
lutrin
methinks
i
now
have
given
you
specimens
enough
from
the
english
poets
i
have
made
some
transient
mention
of
their
philosophers
but
as
for
good
historians
among
them
i
do
know
of
any
and
indeed
a
frenchman
was
forced
to
write
their
history
possibly
the
english
genius
which
is
either
languid
or
impetuous
has
not
yet
acquired
that
unaffected
eloquence
that
plain
but
majestic
air
which
history
requires
possibly
too
the
spirit
of
party
which
exhibits
objects
in
a
dim
and
confused
light
may
have
sunk
the
credit
of
their
historians
one
half
of
the
nation
is
always
at
variance
with
the
other
half
i
have
met
with
people
who
assured
me
that
the
duke
of
marlborough
was
a
coward
and
that
pope
was
a
fool
just
as
some
jesuits
in
france
declare
pascal
to
have
been
a
man
of
little
or
no
genius
and
some
jansenists
affirm
father
bourdaloue
to
have
been
a
mere
babbler
the
jacobites
consider
mary
queen
of
scots
as
a
pious
heroine
but
those
of
an
opposite
party
look
upon
her
as
a
prostitute
an
adulteress
a
murderer
thus
the
english
have
memorials
of
the
several
reigns
but
no
such
thing
as
a
history
there
is
indeed
now
living
one
gordon
the
public
are
obliged
to
him
for
a
translation
of
tacitus
who
is
very
capable
of
writing
the
history
of
his
own
country
but
rapin
de
thoyras
got
the
start
of
him
to
conclude
in
my
opinion
the
english
have
not
such
good
historians
as
the
french
have
no
such
thing
as
a
real
tragedy
have
several
delightful
comedies
some
wonderful
passages
in
certain
of
their
poems
and
boast
of
philosophers
that
are
worthy
of
instructing
mankind
the
english
have
reaped
very
great
benefit
from
the
writers
of
our
nation
and
therefore
we
ought
since
they
have
not
scrupled
to
be
in
our
debt
to
borrow
from
them
both
the
english
and
we
came
after
the
italians
who
have
been
our
instructors
in
all
the
arts
and
whom
we
have
surpassed
in
some
i
can
not
determine
which
of
the
three
nations
ought
to
be
honoured
with
the
palm
but
happy
the
writer
who
could
display
their
various
merits
letter
on
the
regard
that
ought
to
be
shown
to
men
of
letters
neither
the
english
nor
any
other
people
have
foundations
established
in
favour
of
the
polite
arts
like
those
in
france
there
are
universities
in
most
countries
but
it
is
in
france
only
that
we
meet
with
so
beneficial
an
encouragement
for
astronomy
and
all
parts
of
the
mathematics
for
physic
for
researches
into
antiquity
for
painting
sculpture
and
architecture
louis
xiv
has
immortalised
his
name
by
these
several
foundations
and
this
immortality
did
not
cost
him
two
hundred
thousand
livres
a
year
i
must
confess
that
one
of
the
things
i
very
much
wonder
at
is
that
as
the
parliament
of
great
britain
have
promised
a
reward
of
pounds
sterling
to
any
person
who
may
discover
the
longitude
they
should
never
have
once
thought
to
imitate
louis
xiv
in
his
munificence
with
regard
to
the
arts
and
sciences
merit
indeed
meets
in
england
with
rewards
of
another
kind
which
redound
more
to
the
honour
of
the
nation
the
english
have
so
great
a
veneration
for
exalted
talents
that
a
man
of
merit
in
their
country
is
always
sure
of
making
his
fortune
addison
in
france
would
have
been
elected
a
member
of
one
of
the
academies
and
by
the
credit
of
some
women
might
have
obtained
a
yearly
pension
of
twelve
hundred
livres
or
else
might
have
been
imprisoned
in
the
bastile
upon
pretence
that
certain
strokes
in
his
tragedy
of
had
been
discovered
which
glanced
at
the
porter
of
some
man
in
power
addison
was
raised
to
the
post
of
secretary
of
state
in
england
sir
isaac
newton
was
made
master
of
the
royal
mint
congreve
had
a
considerable
employment
mr
prior
was
plenipotentiary
dr
swift
is
dean
of
patrick
in
dublin
and
is
more
revered
in
ireland
than
the
primate
himself
the
religion
which
pope
professes
excludes
him
indeed
from
preferments
of
every
kind
but
then
it
did
not
prevent
his
gaining
two
hundred
thousand
livres
by
his
excellent
translation
of
homer
i
myself
saw
a
long
time
in
france
the
author
of
ready
to
perish
for
hunger
and
the
son
of
one
of
the
greatest
men
our
country
ever
gave
birth
to
and
who
was
beginning
to
run
the
noble
career
which
his
father
had
set
him
would
have
been
reduced
to
the
extremes
of
misery
had
he
not
been
patronised
by
monsieur
fagon
but
the
circumstance
which
mostly
encourages
the
arts
in
england
is
the
great
veneration
which
is
paid
them
the
picture
of
the
prime
minister
hangs
over
the
chimney
of
his
own
closet
but
i
have
seen
that
of
pope
in
twenty
noblemen
houses
sir
isaac
newton
was
revered
in
his
lifetime
and
had
a
due
respect
paid
to
him
after
his
death
the
greatest
men
in
the
nation
disputing
who
should
have
the
honour
of
holding
up
his
pall
go
into
westminster
abbey
and
you
will
find
that
what
raises
the
admiration
of
the
spectator
is
not
the
mausoleums
of
the
english
kings
but
the
monuments
which
the
gratitude
of
the
nation
has
erected
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
those
illustrious
men
who
contributed
to
its
glory
we
view
their
statues
in
that
abbey
in
the
same
manner
as
those
of
sophocles
plato
and
other
immortal
personages
were
viewed
in
athens
and
i
am
persuaded
that
the
bare
sight
of
those
glorious
monuments
has
fired
more
than
one
breast
and
been
the
occasion
of
their
becoming
great
men
the
english
have
even
been
reproached
with
paying
too
extravagant
honours
to
mere
merit
and
censured
for
interring
the
celebrated
actress
oldfield
in
westminster
abbey
with
almost
the
same
pomp
as
sir
isaac
newton
some
pretend
that
the
english
had
paid
her
these
great
funeral
honours
purposely
to
make
us
more
strongly
sensible
of
the
barbarity
and
injustice
which
they
object
to
us
for
having
buried
mademoiselle
le
couvreur
ignominiously
in
the
fields
but
be
assured
from
me
that
the
english
were
prompted
by
no
other
principle
in
burying
oldfield
in
westminster
abbey
than
their
good
sense
they
are
far
from
being
so
ridiculous
as
to
brand
with
infamy
an
art
which
has
immortalised
a
euripides
and
a
sophocles
or
to
exclude
from
the
body
of
their
citizens
a
set
of
people
whose
business
is
to
set
off
with
the
utmost
grace
of
speech
and
action
those
pieces
which
the
nation
is
proud
of
under
the
reign
of
charles
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
civil
wars
raised
by
a
number
of
rigid
fanatics
who
at
last
were
the
victims
to
it
a
great
many
pieces
were
published
against
theatrical
and
other
shows
which
were
attacked
with
the
greater
virulence
because
that
monarch
and
his
queen
daughter
to
henry
of
france
were
passionately
fond
of
them
one
prynne
a
man
of
most
furiously
scrupulous
principles
who
would
have
thought
himself
damned
had
he
worn
a
cassock
instead
of
a
short
cloak
and
have
been
glad
to
see
of
mankind
cut
the
other
to
pieces
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
took
it
into
his
head
to
write
a
most
wretched
satire
against
some
pretty
good
comedies
which
were
exhibited
very
innocently
every
night
before
their
majesties
he
quoted
the
authority
of
the
rabbis
and
some
passages
from
bonaventure
to
prove
that
the
oedipus
of
sophocles
was
the
work
of
the
evil
spirit
that
terence
was
excommunicated
and
added
that
doubtless
brutus
who
was
a
very
severe
jansenist
assassinated
julius
caesar
for
no
other
reason
but
because
he
who
was
pontifex
maximus
presumed
to
write
a
tragedy
the
subject
of
which
was
oedipus
lastly
he
declared
that
all
who
frequented
the
theatre
were
excommunicated
as
they
thereby
renounced
their
baptism
this
was
casting
the
highest
insult
on
the
king
and
all
the
royal
family
and
as
the
english
loved
their
prince
at
that
time
they
could
not
bear
to
hear
a
writer
talk
of
excommunicating
him
though
they
themselves
afterwards
cut
his
head
off
prynne
was
summoned
to
appear
before
the
star
chamber
his
wonderful
book
from
which
father
le
brun
stole
his
was
sentenced
to
be
burnt
by
the
common
hangman
and
himself
to
lose
his
ears
his
trial
is
now
extant
the
italians
are
far
from
attempting
to
cast
a
blemish
on
the
opera
or
to
excommunicate
signor
senesino
or
signora
cuzzoni
with
regard
to
myself
i
could
presume
to
wish
that
the
magistrates
would
suppress
i
know
not
what
contemptible
pieces
written
against
the
stage
for
when
the
english
and
italians
hear
that
we
brand
with
the
greatest
mark
of
infamy
an
art
in
which
we
excel
that
we
excommunicate
persons
who
receive
salaries
from
the
king
that
we
condemn
as
impious
a
spectacle
exhibited
in
convents
and
monasteries
that
we
dishonour
sports
in
which
louis
xiv
and
louis
performed
as
actors
that
we
give
the
title
of
the
devil
works
to
pieces
which
are
received
by
magistrates
of
the
most
severe
character
and
represented
before
a
virtuous
queen
when
i
say
foreigners
are
told
of
this
insolent
conduct
this
contempt
for
the
royal
authority
and
this
gothic
rusticity
which
some
presume
to
call
christian
severity
what
an
idea
must
they
entertain
of
our
nation
and
how
will
it
be
possible
for
them
to
conceive
either
that
our
laws
give
a
sanction
to
an
art
which
is
declared
infamous
or
that
some
persons
dare
to
stamp
with
infamy
an
art
which
receives
a
sanction
from
the
laws
is
rewarded
by
kings
cultivated
and
encouraged
by
the
greatest
men
and
admired
by
whole
nations
and
that
father
le
brun
impertinent
libel
against
the
stage
is
seen
in
a
bookseller
shop
standing
the
very
next
to
the
immortal
labours
of
racine
of
corneille
of
moliere
letter
on
the
royal
society
and
other
academies
the
english
had
an
academy
of
sciences
many
years
before
us
but
then
it
is
not
under
such
prudent
regulations
as
ours
the
only
reason
of
which
very
possibly
is
because
it
was
founded
before
the
academy
of
paris
for
had
it
been
founded
after
it
would
very
probably
have
adopted
some
of
the
sage
laws
of
the
former
and
improved
upon
others
two
things
and
those
the
most
essential
to
man
are
wanting
in
the
royal
society
of
london
i
mean
rewards
and
laws
a
seat
in
the
academy
at
paris
is
a
small
but
secure
fortune
to
a
geometrician
or
a
chemist
but
this
is
so
far
from
being
the
case
at
london
that
the
several
members
of
the
royal
society
are
at
a
continual
though
indeed
small
expense
any
man
in
england
who
declares
himself
a
lover
of
the
mathematics
and
natural
philosophy
and
expresses
an
inclination
to
be
a
member
of
the
royal
society
is
immediately
elected
into
it
but
in
france
it
is
not
enough
that
a
man
who
aspires
to
the
honour
of
being
a
member
of
the
academy
and
of
receiving
the
royal
stipend
has
a
love
for
the
sciences
he
must
at
the
same
time
be
deeply
skilled
in
them
and
is
obliged
to
dispute
the
seat
with
competitors
who
are
so
much
the
more
formidable
as
they
are
fired
by
a
principle
of
glory
by
interest
by
the
difficulty
itself
and
by
that
inflexibility
of
mind
which
is
generally
found
in
those
who
devote
themselves
to
that
pertinacious
study
the
mathematics
the
academy
of
sciences
is
prudently
confined
to
the
study
of
nature
and
indeed
this
is
a
field
spacious
enough
for
fifty
or
threescore
persons
to
range
in
that
of
london
mixes
indiscriminately
literature
with
physics
but
methinks
the
founding
an
academy
merely
for
the
polite
arts
is
more
judicious
as
it
prevents
confusion
and
the
joining
in
some
measure
of
heterogeneals
such
as
a
dissertation
on
the
of
the
roman
ladies
with
a
hundred
or
more
new
curves
as
there
is
very
little
order
and
regularity
in
the
royal
society
and
not
the
least
encouragement
and
that
the
academy
of
paris
is
on
a
quite
different
foot
it
is
no
wonder
that
our
transactions
are
drawn
up
in
a
more
just
and
beautiful
manner
than
those
of
the
english
soldiers
who
are
under
a
regular
discipline
and
besides
well
paid
must
necessarily
at
last
perform
more
glorious
achievements
than
others
who
are
mere
volunteers
it
must
indeed
be
confessed
that
the
royal
society
boast
their
newton
but
then
he
did
not
owe
his
knowledge
and
discoveries
to
that
body
so
far
from
it
that
the
latter
were
intelligible
to
very
few
of
his
fellow
members
a
genius
like
that
of
sir
isaac
belonged
to
all
the
academies
in
the
world
because
all
had
a
thousand
things
to
learn
of
him
the
celebrated
dean
swift
formed
a
design
in
the
latter
end
of
the
late
queen
reign
to
found
an
academy
for
the
english
tongue
upon
the
model
of
that
of
the
french
this
project
was
promoted
by
the
late
earl
of
oxford
lord
high
treasurer
and
much
more
by
the
lord
bolingbroke
secretary
of
state
who
had
the
happy
talent
of
speaking
without
premeditation
in
the
parliament
house
with
as
much
purity
as
dean
swift
wrote
in
his
closet
and
who
would
have
been
the
ornament
and
protector
of
that
academy
those
only
would
have
been
chosen
members
of
it
whose
works
will
last
as
long
as
the
english
tongue
such
as
dean
swift
mr
prior
whom
we
saw
here
invested
with
a
public
character
and
whose
fame
in
england
is
equal
to
that
of
la
fontaine
in
france
pope
the
english
boileau
congreve
who
may
be
called
their
moliere
and
several
other
eminent
persons
whose
names
i
have
forgot
all
these
would
have
raised
the
glory
of
that
body
to
a
great
height
even
in
its
infancy
but
queen
anne
being
snatched
suddenly
from
the
world
the
whigs
were
resolved
to
ruin
the
protectors
of
the
intended
academy
a
circumstance
that
was
of
the
most
fatal
consequence
to
polite
literature
the
members
of
this
academy
would
have
had
a
very
great
advantage
over
those
who
first
formed
that
of
the
french
for
swift
prior
congreve
dryden
pope
addison
had
fixed
the
english
tongue
by
their
writings
whereas
chapelain
colletet
cassaigne
faret
perrin
cotin
our
first
academicians
were
a
disgrace
to
their
country
and
so
much
ridicule
is
now
attached
to
their
very
names
that
if
an
author
of
some
genius
in
this
age
had
the
misfortune
to
be
called
chapelain
or
cotin
he
would
be
under
a
necessity
of
changing
his
name
one
circumstance
to
which
the
english
academy
should
especially
have
attended
is
to
have
prescribed
to
themselves
occupations
of
a
quite
different
kind
from
those
with
which
our
academicians
amuse
themselves
a
wit
of
this
country
asked
me
for
the
memoirs
of
the
french
academy
i
answered
they
have
no
memoirs
but
have
printed
threescore
or
fourscore
volumes
in
quarto
of
compliments
the
gentleman
perused
one
or
two
of
them
but
without
being
able
to
understand
the
style
in
which
they
were
written
though
he
understood
all
our
good
authors
perfectly
all
says
he
i
see
in
these
elegant
discourses
is
that
the
member
elect
having
assured
the
audience
that
his
predecessor
was
a
great
man
that
cardinal
richelieu
was
a
very
great
man
that
the
chancellor
seguier
was
a
pretty
great
man
that
louis
xiv
was
a
more
than
great
man
the
director
answers
in
the
very
same
strain
and
adds
that
the
member
elect
may
also
be
a
sort
of
great
man
and
that
himself
in
quality
of
director
must
also
have
some
share
in
this
greatness
the
cause
why
all
these
academical
discourses
have
unhappily
done
so
little
honour
to
this
body
is
evident
enough
est
temporis
potius
quam
the
fault
is
owing
to
the
age
rather
than
to
particular
persons
it
grew
up
insensibly
into
a
custom
for
every
academician
to
repeat
these
elogiums
at
his
reception
it
was
laid
down
as
a
kind
of
law
that
the
public
should
be
indulged
from
time
to
time
the
sullen
satisfaction
of
yawning
over
these
productions
if
the
reason
should
afterwards
be
sought
why
the
greatest
geniuses
who
have
been
incorporated
into
that
body
have
sometimes
made
the
worst
speeches
i
answer
that
it
is
wholly
owing
to
a
strong
propension
the
gentlemen
in
question
had
to
shine
and
to
display
a
subject
in
a
new
and
uncommon
light
the
necessity
of
saying
something
the
perplexity
of
having
nothing
to
say
and
a
desire
of
being
witty
are
three
circumstances
which
alone
are
capable
of
making
even
the
greatest
writer
ridiculous
these
gentlemen
not
being
able
to
strike
out
any
new
thoughts
hunted
after
a
new
play
of
words
and
delivered
themselves
without
thinking
at
all
in
like
manner
as
people
who
should
seem
to
chew
with
great
eagerness
and
make
as
though
they
were
eating
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
just
starved
it
is
a
law
in
the
french
academy
to
publish
all
those
discourses
by
which
only
they
are
known
but
they
should
rather
make
a
law
never
to
print
any
of
them
but
the
academy
of
the
have
a
more
prudent
and
more
useful
object
which
is
to
present
the
public
with
a
collection
of
transactions
that
abound
with
curious
researches
and
critiques
these
transactions
are
already
esteemed
by
foreigners
and
it
were
only
to
be
wished
that
some
subjects
in
them
had
been
more
thoroughly
examined
and
that
others
had
not
been
treated
at
all
as
for
instance
we
should
have
been
very
well
satisfied
had
they
omitted
i
know
not
what
dissertation
on
the
prerogative
of
the
right
hand
over
the
left
and
some
others
which
though
not
published
under
so
ridiculous
a
title
are
yet
written
on
subjects
that
are
almost
as
frivolous
and
silly
the
academy
of
sciences
in
such
of
their
researches
as
are
of
a
more
difficult
kind
and
a
more
sensible
use
embrace
the
knowledge
of
nature
and
the
improvements
of
the
arts
we
may
presume
that
such
profound
such
uninterrupted
pursuits
as
these
such
exact
calculations
such
refined
discoveries
such
extensive
and
exalted
views
will
at
last
produce
something
that
may
prove
of
advantage
to
the
universe
hitherto
as
we
have
observed
together
the
most
useful
discoveries
have
been
made
in
the
most
barbarous
times
one
would
conclude
that
the
business
of
the
most
enlightened
ages
and
the
most
learned
bodies
is
to
argue
and
debate
on
things
which
were
invented
by
ignorant
people
we
know
exactly
the
angle
which
the
sail
of
a
ship
is
to
make
with
the
keel
in
order
to
its
sailing
better
and
yet
columbus
discovered
america
without
having
the
least
idea
of
the
property
of
this
angle
however
i
am
far
from
inferring
from
hence
that
we
are
to
confine
ourselves
merely
to
a
blind
practice
but
happy
it
were
would
naturalists
and
geometricians
unite
as
much
as
possible
the
practice
with
the
theory
strange
but
so
it
is
that
those
things
which
reflect
the
greatest
honour
on
the
human
mind
are
frequently
of
the
least
benefit
to
it
a
man
who
understands
the
four
fundamental
rules
of
arithmetic
aided
by
a
little
good
sense
shall
amass
prodigious
wealth
in
trade
shall
become
a
sir
peter
delme
a
sir
richard
hopkins
a
sir
gilbert
heathcote
whilst
a
poor
algebraist
spends
his
whole
life
in
searching
for
astonishing
properties
and
relations
in
numbers
which
at
the
same
time
are
of
no
manner
of
use
and
will
not
acquaint
him
with
the
nature
of
exchanges
this
is
very
nearly
the
case
with
most
of
the
arts
there
is
a
certain
point
beyond
which
all
researches
serve
to
no
other
purpose
than
merely
to
delight
an
inquisitive
mind
those
ingenious
and
useless
truths
may
be
compared
to
stars
which
by
being
placed
at
too
great
a
distance
can
not
afford
us
the
least
light
with
regard
to
the
french
academy
how
great
a
service
would
they
do
to
literature
to
the
language
and
the
nation
if
instead
of
publishing
a
set
of
compliments
annually
they
would
give
us
new
editions
of
the
valuable
works
written
in
the
age
of
louis
purged
from
the
several
errors
of
diction
which
are
crept
into
them
there
are
many
of
these
errors
in
corneille
and
moliere
but
those
in
la
fontaine
are
very
numerous
such
as
could
not
be
corrected
might
at
least
be
pointed
out
by
this
means
as
all
the
europeans
read
those
works
they
would
teach
them
our
language
in
its
utmost
purity
which
by
that
means
would
be
fixed
to
a
lasting
standard
and
valuable
french
books
being
then
printed
at
the
king
expense
would
prove
one
of
the
most
glorious
monuments
the
nation
could
boast
i
have
been
told
that
boileau
formerly
made
this
proposal
and
that
it
has
since
been
revived
by
a
gentleman
eminent
for
his
genius
his
fine
sense
and
just
taste
for
criticism
but
this
thought
has
met
with
the
fate
of
many
other
useful
projects
of
being
applauded
and
neglected
