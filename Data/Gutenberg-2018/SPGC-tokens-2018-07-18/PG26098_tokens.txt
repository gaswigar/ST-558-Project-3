foreword
this
book
is
made
up
from
my
contributions
to
a
casual
selection
from
the
four
hundred
or
so
which
have
appeared
in
the
last
nine
years
it
is
offered
to
the
american
public
as
a
sample
of
that
humour
and
perhaps
therefore
british
humour
which
americans
so
often
profess
not
to
understand
according
to
whether
they
like
it
or
do
not
like
it
i
hope
they
will
consider
it
a
representative

an
unrepresentative

margery
i
her
sock
i
when
margery
was
three
months
old
i
wrote
a
letter
to
her
mother
if
you
have
a
copy
in
class
d
at
net
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
from
you
i
am
baby
on
tuesday
i
got
an
answer
by
the
morning
post
in
reply
to
yours
how
dare
you
insult
my
child
she
is
in
class
priceless
and
bought
in
by
the
owner
four
months
old
and
two
days
on
christmas
day
fancy
i
am
baby
margery
had
been
getting
into
an
expensive
way
of
celebrating
her
birthday
every
week
hitherto
i
had
ignored
it
but
now
i
wrote
automatically
your
baby
should
be
in
class
d
by
now
i
can
not
understand
why
it
is
not
so
perhaps
i
shall
hear
from
you
later
on
with
regard
to
this
meanwhile
i
think
that
the
extraordinary
coincidence
all
but
two
days
of
the
baby
birthday
with
christmas
day
calls
for
some
recognition
on
my
part
what
would
margery
like
you
who
are
in
constant
communication
with
her
should
be
able
to
tell
me
i
hear
coral
necklaces
well
spoken
of
what
do
you
think
i
remember
reading
once
of
a
robber
who
killed
a
little
baby
for
the
coral
on
its
neck
which
shows
at
any
rate
that
they
are
worn
do
you
know
how
coral
reefs
are
made
it
is
a
most
fascinating
business
then
there
is
a
silver
mug
to
be
considered
the
only
thing
you
can
drink
out
of
a
mug
is
beer
yet
it
is
a
popular
present
perhaps
you
with
your
supposed
greater
knowledge
of
babies
will
explain
this
meanwhile
i
am
baby
which
is
a
much
finer
thing
than
a
mother
to
which
her
mother
dear
it
is
too
sweet
of
you
to
say
you
would
like
to
get
baby
something
no
i
do
know
how
coral
reefs
are
made
and
want
to
i
think
it
is
wicked
of
you
to
talk
like
that
i
sure
i
sha
dare
let
her
wear
anything
valuable
now
and
i
do
think
she
really
wants
a
mug
i
sure
i
do
know
what
she
does
want
except
to
see
her
uncle
there
but
it
ought
to
be
something
that
she
value
when
she
grows
up
and
of
course
we
could
keep
it
for
her
in
the
meantime
her
father
has
smoked
his
last
cigar
is
it
awful
i
have
forbidden
him
to
waste
his
money
on
any
more
but
he
says
he
must
give
me
for
a
christmas
present
if
he
does
i
shall
give
him
that
sideboard
that
i
want
so
badly
and
then
we
shall
both
go
to
prison
together
you
will
look
after
baby
wo
you
i
am
baby
which
she
is
proud
but
does
think
it
a
little
bit
classier
than
an
uncle
and
so
finally
i
i
thought
of
the
very
thing
i
am
baby
that
ends
chapter
i
here
we
go
on
to
ii
chapter
ii
finds
me
in
the
toy
department
of
the
stores
i
want
i
said
a
present
for
a
child
yes
sir
about
how
old
it
must
be
quite
new
i
said
sternly
do
be
silly
oh
i
see
well
the
child
is
only
a
baby
ah
yes
now
here
if
it
at
all
fond
of
animals
i
say
you
must
call
it
i
get
in
an
awful
row
if
i
do
of
course
i
suppose
it
all
right
for
you
only
well
be
careful
you
the
attendant
promised
and
asked
whether
the
child
was
a
boy
or
girl
and
had
you
thought
of
anything
for
the
little
girl
well
yes
i
had
rather
thought
of
a
sideboard
i
beg
your
pardon
a
sideboard
the
sideboard
department
is
upstairs
was
there
anything
else
for
the
little
girl
well
a
box
of
cigars
rather
full
and
if
you
have
any
the
cigar
department
is
on
the
ground
floor
but
your
lord
chamberlain
told
me
i
was
to
come
here
if
i
wanted
a
present
for
a
child
if
you
require
anything
in
the
toy
line
yes
but
what
good
are
toys
to
a
baby
of
four
months
do
be
reasonable
what
was
it
you
suggested
a
sideboard
and
a
cigar
that
was
my
idea
it
may
not
be
the
best
possible
but
at
least
it
is
better
than
perfectly
useless
toys
you
can
always
blow
smoke
in
its
face
or
bump
its
head
against
the
sideboard
if
you
have
the
latin
whereupon
with
great
dignity
i
made
my
way
to
the
lift
in
the
sideboard
department
i
said
i
want
a
sideboard
for
a
little
girl
of
four
months
and
please
do
call
her
i
nearly
had
a
row
with
one
of
your
downstairs
staff
about
that
i
will
try
to
be
careful
about
that
sir
he
replied
what
sort
of
a
one
blue
eyes
and
not
much
hair
and
really
rather
a
sweet
smile
was
that
what
you
wanted
to
know
thank
you
sir
but
i
meant
what
sort
of
a
sideboard
i
took
him
confidentially
by
the
arm
look
here
i
said
you
know
how
when
one
is
carrying
a
baby
about
one
bumps
its
head
at
all
the
corners
well
not
too
much
of
that
the
mothers
do
really
like
it
you
know
they
smile
at
the
time
but
well
not
too
many
corners
yes
i
like
that
very
much
no
i
take
it
with
me
the
attendant
wrote
out
the
bill
number
sir
she
the
first
that
why
i
so
nervous
i
never
bought
a
sideboard
for
a
child
before
your
stores
number
i
mean
sir
i
have
got
one
is
it
necessary
must
have
a
number
sir
then
i
think
of
a
nice
one
for
you
let
see
how
does
that
strike
you
and
the
name
oh
i
ca
tell
you
that
you
must
look
that
up
for
yourself
downstairs
i
bought
some
cigars
for
a
little
girl
of
four
months
i
said
and
she
likes
them
rather
full
please
do
argue
with
me
all
your
men
chatter
so
i
must
said
the
attendant
it
like
this
if
she
is
only
four
months
she
is
obviously
little
your
observation
is
therefore
tautological
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
said
hotly
she
is
rather
big
for
four
months
then
it
was
a
lie
look
here
you
give
me
those
cigars
and
do
talk
so
much
already
had
words
with
your
master
of
the
sideboards
and
your
for
the
toy
department
thank
you
if
you
would
kindly
send
them
iii
so
there
it
is
i
have
given
the
spirit
rather
than
the
actual
letter
of
what
happened
at
the
stores
but
that
the
things
have
been
ordered
there
is
no
doubt
and
when
margery
wakes
up
on
christmas
day
to
find
a
sideboard
and
a
box
of
cigars
in
her
sock
i
hope
she
will
remember
that
she
has
chiefly
her
mother
to
thank
for
it
ii
how
we
play
the
pianola
foreword
margery
wishes
me
to
publish
the
following
correspondence
which
has
recently
passed
between
us
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
name
under
which
i
appear
in
it
may
perhaps
need
explanation
i
hate
explanations
but
here
it
is
when
margery
was
eight
months
old
she
was
taught
to
call
me
uncle
i
must
suppose
that
at
this
time
i
was
always
giving
her
things
things
she
really
wanted
such
as
the
best
china
evening
papers
and
so
on
which
had
been
withheld
by
those
in
authority
later
on
these
persons
came
round
to
my
way
of
thinking
and
gave
her
if
not
the
best
china
at
any
rate
cake
and
naturally
their
offerings
being
appreciated
at
last
were
greeted
with
the
familiar
cry
of
uncle
no
dear
not
came
the
correction
i
i
some
wonderful
news
for
you
guess
what
it
is
but
no
you
never
will
well
i
tell
you
i
can
walk
really
and
really
it
is
most
awfully
interesting
you
put
one
foot
out
to
the
right
and
then
you
bring
the
left
after
it
that
one
walk
and
i
have
done
seven
altogether
you
have
to
keep
your
hands
out
in
front
of
you
so
as
to
balance
properly
that
all
the
rules
the
rest
is
just
knack
i
got
it
quite
suddenly
it
is
such
fun
i
wake
up
about
five
every
morning
now
thinking
of
it
of
course
i
fall
down
now
and
then
you
see
i
only
beginning
when
i
fall
mother
comes
and
picks
me
up
that
reminds
me
i
do
want
you
to
call
me
baby
any
more
now
i
can
walk
babies
ca
walk
they
just
get
carried
about
and
put
in
perambulators
i
was
given
a
lot
of
names
a
long
time
ago
but
i
forget
what
they
were
i
think
one
was
rather
silly
like
margery
but
i
have
never
had
it
used
lately
mother
always
calls
me
now
write
directly
you
get
this
your
loving
ii
dear
i
was
so
glad
to
get
your
letter
because
i
was
just
going
to
write
to
you
what
do
you
think
no
you
never
guess
shall
i
tell
you
no
yes
no
well
i
bought
a
pianola
it
really
rather
difficult
to
play
it
properly
i
know
people
like
paderewski
and
i
can
only
think
of
paderewski
for
the
moment
i
know
that
sort
of
person
does
think
much
of
the
pianola
artist
but
they
are
quite
wrong
about
it
all
the
mechanical
agility
with
the
fingers
is
nothing
the
soul
is
everything
now
you
can
get
the
soul
the
molto
feeling
just
as
well
in
the
pianola
as
in
the
piano
of
course
you
have
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
the
music
some
people
roll
it
off
just
like
a
but
when
i
see
or
or
anything
of
that
kind
on
the
score
i
on
it
like
a
bird
no
time
for
more
now
as
i
just
got
a
new
lot
of
music
in
your
loving
when
are
you
coming
to
hear
me
play
i
did
mumbling
mose
just
now
with
one
hand
and
lots
of
soul
signed
i
am
glad
you
can
walk
iii
i
am
rather
upset
about
my
walking
you
remember
i
told
you
i
had
done
seven
in
my
last
well
this
morning
i
could
do
a
single
one
well
i
did
do
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
i
suppose
some
people
would
say
it
did
count
because
i
fell
down
directly
after
though
i
do
see
that
that
matters
do
you
thankyou
but
even
with
that
one
it
was
only
one
and
yet
i
know
i
did
seven
the
day
before
i
wonder
why
it
is
i
do
it
the
right
way
i
sure
and
i
keep
my
hands
out
so
as
to
balance
so
perhaps
it
the
shoes
that
are
wrong
i
must
ask
mother
to
get
me
a
new
pair
and
tell
the
man
they
for
walks
now
do
write
me
a
nice
long
letter
thankyou
because
i
feel
very
miserable
about
this
it
is
right
is
it
when
you
have
the
right
leg
out
only
to
bring
the
left
one
just
up
to
it
and
not
beyond
and
does
it
matter
which
foot
you
start
with
let
me
know
quickly
because
father
is
coming
home
and
i
want
to
show
him
your
loving
i
am
glad
you
like
your
pianola
iv
very
glad
to
get
yours
if
you
really
want
a
long
letter
you
shall
have
one
only
i
warn
you
that
if
once
i
begin
nothing
less
than
any
earthquake
can
stop
me
well
first
then
i
played
the
merry
widow
waltz
yesterday
to
polacca
who
is
a
great
authority
on
music
and
in
with
all
the
queen
hall
set
and
she
said
that
my
touch
reminded
her
of
i
forgotten
the
man
name
now
which
is
rather
sickening
because
it
spoils
the
story
a
bit
but
he
was
one
of
the
real
tiptoppers
who
makes
hundreds
a
week
and
well
that
was
the
sort
of
man
i
reminded
her
of
if
i
can
do
that
with
a
waltz
it
stands
to
reason
that
with
something
classic
there
be
no
holding
me
i
think
i
shall
give
a
recital
tickets
no
free
seats
no
emergency
exit
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
have
an
emergency
exit
at
a
recital
pages
really
you
must
hear
me
doing
the
double
f
in
the
boston
cake
walk
to
get
me
at
my
best
you
heard
kubelik
on
the
violin
well
it
not
a
bit
like
that
and
yet
there
just
the
something
which
links
great
artists
together
no
matter
what
their
medium
of
expression
your
loving
glad
you
getting
on
so
well
with
your
walking
v
hooray
hooray
hooray
i
did
walks
father
counted
he
says
my
style
reminds
him
of
rather
how
many
times
can
he
do
it
not
on
the
third
day
i
sure
is
it
splendid
of
me
i
see
now
where
i
was
wrong
yesterday
i
got
the
knack
again
suddenly
this
morning
and
i
all
right
now
i
shall
walk
round
the
table
it
is
a
longish
way
and
there
are
four
turns
which
i
am
not
sure
about
how
do
you
turn
i
suppose
you
put
the
right
hand
out
your
very
loving
vi
i
am
rather
hurt
by
your
letters
i
have
written
several
times
to
tell
you
all
about
my
new
pianola
and
you
do
seem
to
take
any
interest
at
all
i
was
going
to
have
told
you
this
time
that
the
man
in
the
flat
below
had
sent
me
a
note
just
as
if
it
had
been
a
real
piano
he
says
he
does
mind
my
playing
all
day
so
long
as
i
start
before
eight
in
the
morning
as
he
is
in
his
bath
then
and
in
listening
to
the
music
quite
forgets
to
come
out
sometimes
which
i
can
see
might
be
very
awkward
write
to
yours
affectionately
vii
i
am
so
sorry
dear
and
i
will
come
and
hear
your
pianola
and
i
think
it
lovely
and
you
must
be
clever
to
play
it
so
well
but
you
mus
be
angry
with
me
because
i
am
so
taken
up
with
my
walking
you
see
it
is
all
so
new
to
me
i
feel
as
though
i
want
everybody
to
know
all
about
it
your
pianola
must
be
lovely
thankyou
dear
thankyou
could
you
do
you
think
put
all
the
letters
we
wrote
to
each
other
about
my
walking
in
some
book
so
that
other
people
would
know
how
to
do
it
the
way
i
do
you
might
call
it
letters
on
walking
or
how
to
walk
or
but
you
could
get
a
better
title
than
i
could
do
your
very
loving
i
so
glad
about
the
pianola
and
do
you
mind
if
i
just
tell
you
that
i
did
walk
round
the
table
corners
and
all
viii
right
you
are
i
will
think
of
a
good
title
your
loving
iii
the
knight
of
the
we
do
know
his
real
name
but
we
have
decided
to
call
him
arthur
sir
arthur
i
suppose
he
would
be
he
stands
in
bronze
upon
the
and
in
his
right
hand
is
a
javelin
this
makes
him
a
very
dangerous
person
opposite
him
but
behind
the
clock
coward
stands
the
other
fellow
similarly
armed
most
people
imagine
that
the
two
are
fighting
for
the
hand
of
the
lady
on
the
clock
and
they
aver
that
they
can
hear
her
heart
beating
with
the
excitement
of
it
but
to
let
you
into
the
secret
the
other
fellow
does
come
into
the
story
at
all
only
margery
and
i
know
the
true
story
i
think
i
told
it
to
her
one
night
when
she
would
go
to
sleep
or
perhaps
she
told
it
to
me
the
best
of
this
tale
i
say
it
as
the
possible
author
is
that
it
is
modern
it
were
easy
to
have
invented
something
more
in
keeping
with
the
knight
armour
but
we
had
to
remember
that
this
was
the
twentieth
century
and
that
here
in
this
twentieth
century
was
sir
arthur
on
the
with
his
javelin
drawn
back
for
whom
is
he
waiting
it
all
began
i
said
a
year
ago
when
sir
arthur
became
a
member
of
the
south
african
chartered
incorporated
stores
society
limited
ten
per
cents
at
par
men
only
he
was
exactly
a
real
member
having
been
elected
under
rule
two
for
meritorious
performances
rule
one
being
that
this
club
shall
be
called
what
i
said
just
now
but
for
nearly
a
year
he
enjoyed
all
the
privileges
of
membership
including
those
of
paying
a
large
entrance
fee
and
a
still
larger
subscription
at
the
end
of
a
year
however
a
dreadful
thing
happened
they
made
a
third
rule
to
wit
that
no
member
should
go
to
sleep
on
the
billiard
table
of
course
sir
arthur
having
only
got
in
under
rule
two
had
to
resign
he
had
as
i
have
said
paid
his
entrance
fee
and
as
it
happened
his
second
year
subscription
in
advance
naturally
he
was
annoyed
and
that
in
fact
is
why
he
stands
on
the
with
his
javelin
drawn
back
he
is
waiting
for
the
secretary
sir
arthur
is
considered
to
be
a
good
shot
and
the
secretary
wants
all
the
flowers
to
be
white
at
this
point
margery
said
her
best
word
gorky
which
means
a
thousand
thanks
for
the
verisimilitude
of
your
charming
and
interesting
story
but
is
not
the
love
element
a
trifle
weak
margery
is
a
true
woman
we
must
leave
something
to
the
imagination
i
pleaded
the
secretary
no
doubt
had
a
delightful
niece
and
sir
arthur
hopeless
passion
for
her
after
he
had
hit
her
uncle
in
a
vital
spot
would
be
the
basis
of
a
most
powerful
situation
margery
said
gorky
again
which
as
i
have
explained
means
are
such
distressing
situations
within
the
province
of
the
highest
art
when
margery
says
gorky
twice
in
one
night
it
is
useless
to
argue
i
gave
in
at
once
butter
i
said
placed
upon
the
haft
of
the
javelin
would
make
it
slip
and
put
him
off
his
shot
he
would
miss
the
secretary
and
marry
the
niece
so
we
put
a
good
deal
of
butter
on
sir
arthur
and
for
the
moment
the
secretary
is
safe
i
do
know
if
we
shall
be
able
to
keep
it
there
but
in
case
jam
does
as
well
margery
has
promised
to
stroke
him
every
day
however
i
anticipate
as
soon
as
the
secretarial
life
was
saved
margery
said
agga
which
is
as
it
were
or
so
that
i
have
her
permission
to
tell
you
that
story
all
over
again
instead
i
will
give
you
the
tragedy
of
george
the
other
fellow
no
knight
he
as
she
told
it
to
me
afterwards
george
was
quite
a
different
man
from
sir
arthur
so
far
from
being
elected
to
anything
under
rule
two
he
got
blackballed
for
the
north
london
toilet
club
opinions
differed
as
to
why
this
happened
some
said
that
it
was
his
personal
unpopularity
he
had
previously
been
up
without
success
for
the
membership
of
the
local
ratepayers
association
others
among
them
the
proprietor
that
his
hair
grew
too
quickly
anyhow
it
was
a
great
shock
to
george
and
they
had
to
have
a
man
in
to
break
it
to
him
it
always
the
way
when
you
have
a
man
in
george
was
stricken
to
the
heart
this
last
blow
was
too
much
for
what
had
always
been
a
proud
nature
he
decided
to
emigrate
accordingly
he
left
home
and
moved
to
islington
whether
he
is
still
there
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
a
card
with
that
postmark
reached
his
niece
only
this
week
it
was
unsigned
and
bore
on
the
space
reserved
for
inland
communications
these
words
old
old
wish
a
merry
christmas
and
a
happy
new
year
but
what
about
the
javelin
i
asked
margery
this
fellow
had
a
javelin
too
you
remember
gorky
said
margery
for
the
third
time
which
means
well
upon
my
word
i
do
know
what
it
means
but
it
would
explain
it
all
meanwhile
sir
arthur
he
was
in
my
story
you
know
is
still
waiting
for
the
secretary
in
case
the
butter
gives
out
have
i
mentioned
that
the
secretary
wants
the
flowers
to
be
white
iv
the
art
of
conversation
in
conversation
said
somebody
i
think
it
was
my
grandfather
there
should
always
be
a
give
and
take
the
ball
must
be
kept
rolling
if
he
had
ever
had
a
niece
two
years
old
i
do
think
he
would
have
bothered
what
said
margery
pointing
suddenly
that
i
said
stroking
it
is
dear
uncle
nose
what
take
your
finger
away
ah
yes
that
is
dear
uncle
eye
the
left
one
dear
uncle
left
one
said
margery
thoughtfully
what
it
doing
thinking
what
finking
what
dear
uncle
does
every
afternoon
after
lunch
what
lunch
eggs
sardines
macaroons
everything
with
a
great
effort
margery
resisted
the
temptation
to
ask
what
everything
was
a
difficult
question
and
made
a
statement
of
her
own
santa
claus
bring
margie
a
balloon
from
daddy
she
announced
a
balloon
how
jolly
i
said
with
interest
what
sort
are
you
having
one
of
those
ones
with
the
gas
laid
on
or
the
pink
ones
with
a
velvet
collar
down
chimney
said
margery
oh
that
kind
do
you
think
i
mean
is
it
rather
tell
margie
a
story
about
a
balloon
bother
i
murmured
what
bovver
bother
is
what
you
say
when
relations
ask
you
to
tell
them
a
story
about
a
balloon
it
means
for
the
fact
that
we
both
have
the
montmorency
blood
in
our
veins
i
should
be
compelled
to
decline
your
kind
invitation
all
the
stories
i
know
about
balloons
being
stiff
it
also
means
of
talking
about
balloons
wo
you
sing
me
a
little
song
nope
said
margery
bother
she
forgotten
her
music
what
did
you
say
uncle
dear
what
did
you
say
i
sighed
and
began
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
balloon
a
dear
little
toy
balloon
and
and
what
asked
margery
making
a
dab
at
my
chest
what
uncle
dear
that
i
said
is
a
button
more
particularly
a
red
waistcoat
button
more
particularly
still
my
top
red
waistcoat
button
what
she
asked
going
down
one
that
is
a
button
description
second
red
waistcoat
parents
living
both
infectious
diseases
scarlet
fever
slightly
once
what
that
a
ah
yes
a
button
the
third
a
good
little
chap
but
not
so
chubby
as
his
brothers
he
could
go
down
to
margate
with
them
last
year
and
so
of
course
well
as
i
was
saying
there
was
once
a
balloon
and
what
said
margery
bending
forward
suddenly
and
kissing
it
look
here
you
jolly
well
got
to
enclose
a
stamped
addressed
envelope
with
the
next
question
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
you
believe
me
that
again
is
a
button
what
asked
margery
digging
at
the
fifth
button
owing
to
extreme
pressure
on
space
i
began
thank
you
that
also
is
a
button
its
responsibility
is
greater
than
that
of
its
brethren
the
crash
may
come
at
any
moment
luckily
it
has
booked
its
passage
to
the
where
was
i
oh
yes
well
this
balloon
what
said
margery
pointing
to
the
last
one
i
must
have
written
notice
of
that
question
i
ca
tell
you
offhand
what
uncle
dear
well
i
do
know
margie
it
looks
something
like
a
collar
stud
only
somehow
you
would
expect
to
find
a
collar
stud
there
of
course
it
may
have
slipped
or
could
it
be
one
of
those
red
beads
do
you
think
no
it
is
a
bead
and
it
is
a
raspberry
because
this
is
the
wrong
week
for
raspberries
of
course
it
might
be
a
by
jove
i
got
it
it
a
button
i
gave
the
sort
of
with
which
one
announces
these
discoveries
and
margery
whooped
too
a
button
she
cried
a
dear
little
button
she
thought
for
a
moment
what
a
button
this
was
ridiculous
you
do
mean
to
say
i
reproached
her
that
i
got
to
tell
you
now
what
a
button
is
that
i
added
severely
pointing
to
the
top
of
my
waistcoat
is
a
button
what
said
margery
pointing
to
the
next
one
i
looked
at
her
in
horror
then
i
began
to
talk
very
quickly
there
was
once
a
balloon
i
said
rapidly
a
dear
little
boy
balloon
i
mean
toy
balloon
and
this
balloon
was
a
jolly
little
balloon
just
two
minutes
old
and
he
was
always
asking
silly
questions
and
when
he
fell
down
and
exploded
himself
they
used
to
wring
him
out
and
say
come
now
be
a
little
airship
about
it
and
so
what
asked
margery
pointing
to
the
top
button
there
was
only
one
way
out
of
it
i
began
to
sing
a
carol
in
a
very
shrill
voice
all
the
artist
rose
in
margery
do
sing
she
said
hurriedly
margie
sing
what
shall
margie
sing
uncle
before
i
could
suggest
anything
she
was
off
it
was
a
scandalous
song
she
began
by
announcing
that
she
wanted
to
be
among
the
boys
and
anticipating
my
objections
assured
me
that
it
was
no
good
kicking
up
a
noise
because
it
was
no
fun
going
out
when
there
were
any
boys
about
you
were
so
here
the
tune
became
undecided
and
a
chance
word
recalling
another
context
to
her
mind
she
drifted
suddenly
into
a
hymn
and
sang
it
with
the
same
religious
fervour
as
she
had
sung
the
other
her
fair
head
flung
back
and
her
hazel
eyes
gazing
into
heaven
i
listened
carefully
this
was
a
bit
i
did
recognise
the
tune
wavered
for
a
moment
and
out
of
it
these
words
emerged
triumphant
talk
of
me
to
the
boys
you
meet
remember
me
kindly
to
regent
street
and
give
them
my
love
in
the
what
uncle
that
i
said
stroking
it
is
dear
uncle
nose
what
by
the
way
would
you
like
it
all
over
again
no
oh
very
well
afternoon
sleep
the
afternoon
they
came
unto
a
land
in
which
it
seemed
always
i
am
like
napoleon
in
that
i
can
go
to
sleep
at
any
moment
i
am
unlike
him
i
believe
in
that
i
am
always
doing
so
one
makes
no
apology
for
doing
so
on
sunday
afternoon
the
apology
indeed
should
come
from
the
others
the
wakeful
parties
uncle
margery
will
you
come
and
play
wiv
me
i
rather
busy
just
now
i
said
with
closed
eyes
after
tea
why
are
you
raver
busy
just
now
my
baby
only
raver
busy
sometimes
well
then
you
know
what
it
like
how
important
it
is
that
one
should
be
disturbed
but
you
be
beturbed
when
i
ask
you
to
come
and
play
wiv
me
oh
well

said
margery
eagerly
when
we
play
at
trains

do
know
if
you
have
ever
been

said
margery
casually
then
she
gave
an
innocent
little
smile
oh

called
mummy
maud
she
said
in
pretended
surprise
i
quite
i
was
upstairs

hope

ground
floor
where

upstairs

little
do

margery

on
with
the
air
of
a
discoverer

affirmed

anyhow
i
never

i
closed
my
eyes
again
i
fought

sighed
margery
to
herself
my
name
is
not
bingle
i
said
opening
one
eye
why

story

a
very
long
and
sad
one
when

in
road
oh
that
one
well
he
was
crying
because
his
uncle
had
had
any
sleep
all
night
and
when
he
tried
to
go
to
sleep
in
the
afternoon
say
prehaps
again
my
first
rejected
contribution
i
sighed
and
had
another
shot
well
then
i
said
gallantly
it
must
have
been
because
he
had
got
a
sweet
little
girl
of
three
to
play
with
him
yes
said
margery
nodding
her
head
thoughtfully
was
it
vi
a
twice
told
tale
is
that
you
uncle
said
a
voice
from
the
nursery
as
i
hung
my
coat
up
in
the
hall
i
only
got
my
skin
on
but
you
can
come
up
however
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
with
her
nightgown
on
when
i
found
her
i
was
having
my
bath
when
you
came
she
explained
have
you
come
all
the
way
from
london
all
the
way
then
will
you
tell
me
a
story
i
ca
i
going
to
have
my
dinner
i
only
came
up
to
say
good
night
margery
leant
forward
and
whispered
coaxingly
will
you
just
tell
me
about
beauty
and
beast
but
i
told
you
that
such
heaps
of
times
and
it
much
too
long
for
tell
me
of
it
as
much
as
she
held
her
hands
about
nine
inches
apart
that
too
much
as
much
as
the
hands
came
a
little
nearer
together
oh
well
i
tell
you
up
to
where
the
beast
died
he
died
she
corrected
eagerly
yes
well
how
much
will
that
be
as
much
as
i
said
i
nodded
the
preliminary
business
settled
she
gave
a
little
sigh
of
happiness
put
her
arms
round
her
knees
and
waited
breathlessly
for
the
story
she
had
heard
twenty
times
before
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
man
who
had
three
daughters
and
one
day
what
was
the
man
name
margery
i
said
reproachfully
annoyed
at
the
interruption
you
know
i
tell
you
the
man
name
tell
me
now
oswald
i
said
after
a
moment
thought
i
told
daddy
it
was
thomas
said
margery
casually
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
two
names
oswald
thomas
why
did
he
have
two
names
in
case
he
lost
one
well
one
day
this
man
who
was
very
poor
heard
that
a
lot
of
money
was
waiting
for
him
in
a
ship
which
had
come
over
the
sea
to
a
town
some
miles
off
so
he
was
it
waiting
at
weymouf
somewhere
like
that
i
spex
it
must
have
been
weymouf
because
there
lots
of
sea
there
yes
i
sure
it
was
well
he
thought
he
go
to
weymouth
and
get
the
money
how
much
monies
was
it
oh
lots
and
lots
as
much
as
five
pennies
yes
about
that
well
he
said
to
his
daughters
and
asked
them
what
they
like
him
to
bring
back
for
a
present
and
the
first
asked
for
some
lovely
jewels
and
diamonds
and
like
mummy
locket
is
that
jewels
that
sort
of
idea
well
she
wanted
a
lot
of
things
like
that
and
the
second
wanted
some
beautiful
clothes
what
sort
of
clothes
oh
frocks
and
well
frocks
and
all
sorts
of
er
frocks
did
she
want
any
lovely
new
stockings
yes
she
wanted
three
pairs
of
those
and
did
she
want
any
lovely
yes
i
said
hastily
she
wanted
lots
of
those
too
lots
of
margery
gave
a
little
sob
of
happiness
go
on
telling
me
she
said
under
her
breath
well
the
third
daughter
was
called
beauty
and
she
thought
to
herself
father
wo
have
any
money
left
at
all
if
we
all
go
on
like
this
so
she
did
ask
for
anything
very
expensive
like
her
selfish
sisters
she
only
asked
for
a
rose
a
simple
red
rose
margery
moved
uneasily
i
hope
she
said
wistfully
this
bit
is
going
to
be
about
know
it
never
did
before
about
what
good
little
girls
and
bad
little
girls
and
fings
like
that
my
darling
no
of
course
not
i
told
it
wrong
beauty
asked
for
a
rose
because
she
loved
roses
so
and
it
was
a
very
particular
kind
of
red
rose
that
she
wanted
a
sort
that
they
simply
get
to
grow
in
their
own
garden
because
of
the
soil
go
on
telling
me
said
margery
with
a
deep
sigh
of
content
well
he
started
off
to
weymouth
what
day
did
he
start
it
was
monday
and
when
oh
well
anyhow
i
told
daddy
it
was
tuesday
tuesday
now
let
me
think
yes
i
believe
you
right
because
on
monday
he
went
to
a
meeting
of
the
vegetable
gardeners
and
proposed
the
health
of
the
chairman
yes
well
he
started
off
on
tuesday
and
when
he
got
there
he
found
that
there
was
no
money
for
him
at
all
i
spex
somebody
had
taken
it
said
margery
breathlessly
well
it
had
all
gone
prehaps
somebody
had
swallowed
it
said
margery
a
little
carried
away
by
the
subject
by
mistake
anyhow
it
was
gone
and
he
had
to
come
home
again
without
any
money
he
had
gone
far
how
far
asked
margery
as
far
as
and
she
measured
nine
inches
in
the
air
about
miles
when
he
came
to
a
beautiful
garden
was
it
a
really
lovely
big
garden
bigger
than
ours
oh
much
bigger
bigger
than
yours
i
have
got
a
garden
margery
looked
at
me
wonderingly
she
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
and
then
stopped
and
rested
her
head
upon
her
hands
and
thought
out
this
new
situation
at
last
her
face
flushed
with
happiness
she
announced
her
decision
go
on
telling
me
about
beauty
and
the
beast
now
she
said
breathlessly
and
tell
me
why
you
have
got
a
garden
my
average
time
for
beauty
and
the
beast
is
ten
minutes
and
if
we
stop
at
the
place
where
the
beast
thought
he
was
dead
six
minutes
seconds
but
with
the
aid
of
seemingly
innocent
questions
a
determined
character
can
make
even
the
craftiest
uncle
spin
the
story
out
to
next
time
said
margery
when
we
had
reached
the
appointed
place
and
she
was
being
tucked
up
in
bed
will
you
tell
me
the
story
was
there
the
shadow
of
a
smile
in
her
eyes
i
do
know
but
i
sure
it
will
be
wisest
next
time
to
promise
her
the
whole
thing
we
must
make
that
point
clear
at
the
very
start
and
then
we
shall
get
along
vii
the
literary
art
margery
has
a
passion
for
writing
just
now
i
can
see
nothing
in
it
myself
but
if
people
write
i
suppose
you
ca
stop
them
will
you
just
lend
me
your
pencil
she
asked
remind
me
to
give
you
a
hundred
pencils
some
time
i
said
as
i
took
it
out
and
then
you
always
have
one
you
simply
eat
pencils
oo
i
gave
it
you
back
last
time
only
just
you
inveigle
me
down
here
what
do
i
do
i
not
going
to
say
that
again
for
anybody
well
may
i
have
the
pencil
i
gave
her
the
pencil
and
a
sheet
of
paper
and
settled
her
in
a
chair
said
margery
to
herself
planning
out
her
weekly
article
for
the
reviews
baby
she
squared
her
elbows
and
began
to
write
there
she
said
after
five
minutes
composition
the
manuscript
was
brought
over
to
the
critic
and
the
author
stood
proudly
by
to
point
out
subtleties
that
might
have
been
overlooked
at
a
first
reading
explained
the
author
baby
yes
that
very
good
very
neatly
expressed
i
like
that
shall
i
write
some
more
said
margery
eagerly
yes
do
write
some
more
this
is
good
but
it
not
long
enough
the
author
retired
again
and
in
five
minutes
produced
this
b
a
b
y
that
explained
margery
yes
i
like
that
baby
better
than
the
other
one
it
more
spread
out
and
it
bigger
it
one
of
the
biggest
babies
i
seen
shall
i
write
some
more
do
you
write
anything
else
ever
i
like
writing
said
margery
carelessly
yes
but
you
ca
do
much
with
just
that
one
word
suppose
you
wanted
to
write
to
a
man
at
a
shop
sir
you
never
sent
me
my
boots
please
send
them
at
once
as
i
want
to
go
out
this
afternoon
i
am
yours
faithfully
margery
it
would
be
no
good
simply
putting
because
he
would
know
what
you
meant
well
what
it
be
good
putting
ah
that
the
whole
art
of
writing
to
know
what
it
would
be
any
good
putting
you
want
to
learn
lots
and
lots
of
new
words
so
as
to
be
ready
now
here
a
jolly
little
one
that
you
ought
to
meet
i
took
the
pencil
and
wrote
g
o
got
got
margery
her
elbows
on
my
knee
and
her
chin
resting
on
her
hands
studied
the
position
yes
that
old
she
said
he
always
coming
in
when
you
want
to
say
got
a
bad
pain
so
i
ca
accept
your
kind
invitation
or
when
you
want
to
say
more
as
i
got
to
go
to
bed
now
or
quite
simply
got
my
pencil
got
said
margery
got
got
with
appropriate
action
it
makes
a
very
nice
recitation
is
that
a
said
margery
busy
with
the
pencil
which
she
had
snatched
from
me
the
gentleman
with
the
tail
you
have
made
his
tail
quite
long
enough
that
better
margery
retired
to
her
study
charged
with
an
entirely
new
inspiration
and
wrote
her
second
manifesto
it
was
this
g
o
t
got
she
pointed
out
i
inspected
it
carefully
coming
fresh
to
the
idea
margery
had
treated
it
more
spontaneously
than
the
other
but
it
was
distinctly
a
got
one
of
the
gots
have
you
any
more
words
she
asked
holding
tight
to
the
pencil
you
about
exhausted
me
margery
what
was
that
one
you
said
just
now
the
one
you
said
you
would
say
again
oh
you
mean
i
said
pronouncing
it
differently
this
time
yes
write
that
for
me
it
hardly
ever
comes
in
only
when
you
are
writing
to
your
solicitor
what
he
the
gentleman
who
takes
the
money
he
coming
in
then
write
i
took
the
pencil
it
was
my
turn
for
it
and
wrote
solicitor
then
i
read
it
out
slowly
to
margery
spelt
it
to
her
three
times
very
carefully
and
wrote
solicitor
again
then
i
said
it
thoughtfully
to
myself
times
solicitor
then
i
looked
at
it
wonderingly
i
am
not
sure
now
i
said
that
there
is
such
a
word
why
i
thought
there
was
when
i
began
but
now
i
do
think
there
can
be
it
seems
so
silly
let
me
write
it
said
margery
eagerly
taking
the
paper
and
pencil
and
see
if
it
looks
silly
she
retired
and
as
well
as
she
could
for
her
excitement
copied
the
word
down
underneath
the
combined
effort
then
read
as
follows
solicitor
solicitor
solctor
yes
you
done
it
a
lot
of
good
i
said
you
taken
some
of
the
creases
out
i
like
that
much
better
do
you
think
there
is
such
a
word
now
i
beginning
to
feel
more
easy
about
it
i
not
certain
but
i
hope
so
do
i
said
margery
with
the
pencil
in
one
hand
and
the
various
scraps
of
paper
in
the
other
she
climbed
on
to
the
writing
desk
and
gave
herself
up
to
literature
and
it
seems
to
me
that
she
is
well
equipped
for
the
task
for
besides
having
my
pencil
still
of
which
i
say
nothing
for
the
moment
she
has
now
three
separate
themes
upon
which
to
ring
the
changes
a
range
wide
enough
for
any
writer
these
are
baby
got
solicitor
supposing
that
there
is
such
a
word
solicitor
got
baby
and
got
baby
solicitor
indeed
there
are
really
four
themes
here
for
the
last
one
can
have
two
interpretations
it
might
mean
that
you
had
obtained
an
ordinary
solicitor
for
baby
or
it
might
mean
that
you
had
got
a
specially
small
one
for
yourself
it
lacks
therefore
the
lucidity
of
the
best
authors
but
in
a
woman
writer
this
may
be
forgiven
viii
my
secretary
when
five
years
ago
i
used
to
write
long
letters
to
margery
for
some
reason
or
other
she
never
wrote
back
to
save
her
face
i
had
to
answer
the
letters
myself
a
tedious
business
still
i
must
admit
that
the
warmth
and
geniality
of
the
replies
gave
me
a
certain
standing
with
my
friends
who
had
not
looked
for
me
to
be
so
popular
after
some
months
however
pride
stepped
in
one
can
not
pour
out
letter
after
letter
to
a
lady
without
any
acknowledgment
save
from
oneself
and
when
even
my
own
acknowledgments
began
to
lose
their
first
warmth
when
for
instance
i
answered
four
pages
about
my
new
pianola
with
the
curt
reminder
that
i
was
learning
to
walk
and
could
be
bothered
with
music
why
then
at
last
i
saw
that
a
correspondence
so
would
have
to
come
to
an
end
i
wrote
a
farewell
letter
and
replied
to
it
with
tears
but
bless
you
that
was
nearly
five
years
ago
each
morning
now
among
the
usual
pile
of
notes
on
my
plate
from
duchesses
publishers
moneylenders
and
i
find
likely
enough
an
envelope
in
margery
own
handwriting
not
only
is
my
address
printed
upon
it
legibly
but
there
are
also
such
extra
directions
to
the
postman
as
england
and
important
for
its
more
speedy
arrival
and
inside
well
i
give
you
the
last
but
seven
my
dear
uncle
i
thot
you
wher
coming
to
see
me
to
night
but
you
didnt
why
didnt
you
baby
has
p
t
o
hurt
her
knee
isnt
that
a
pity
i
have
some
new
toys
isnt
that
jolly
we
didnt
have
our
five
minutes
so
will
you
krite
to
me
and
tell
me
all
about
p
t
o
your
work
from
your
loving
little
margie
i
always
think
that
footnotes
to
a
letter
are
a
mistake
but
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
should
like
to
explain
a
just
as
some
journalists
feel
that
without
the
word
economic
a
leading
article
lacks
tone
so
margery
feels
and
i
agree
with
her
that
a
certain
is
lent
to
a
letter
by
a
at
the
bottom
of
each
page
b
there
are
lots
of
people
who
think
that
write
is
spelt
rite
margery
knows
that
this
is
not
so
she
knows
that
there
is
a
silent
letter
in
front
of
the
r
which
does
do
anything
but
likes
to
be
there
obviously
if
nobody
is
going
to
take
any
notice
of
this
extra
letter
it
does
much
matter
what
it
is
margery
happened
to
want
to
make
a
k
just
then
at
a
pinch
it
could
be
as
silent
as
a
you
will
please
therefore
regard
the
k
in
krite
as
absolutely
noiseless
c
years
ago
i
claimed
the
privilege
to
monopolise
on
the
occasional
evenings
when
i
was
there
margery
last
ten
minutes
before
she
goes
back
to
some
heaven
of
her
own
each
night
this
privilege
was
granted
it
being
felt
no
doubt
that
she
owed
me
some
compensation
for
my
early
secretarial
work
on
her
behalf
we
used
to
spend
the
ten
minutes
in
listening
to
my
telling
a
fairy
story
always
the
same
one
one
day
the
authorities
stepped
in
and
announced
that
in
future
the
ten
minutes
would
be
reduced
to
five
the
procedure
seemed
to
me
absolutely
illegal
and
i
should
like
to
bring
an
action
against
somebody
but
it
certainly
did
put
the
lid
on
my
fairy
story
of
which
i
was
getting
more
than
a
little
tired
tell
me
about
beauty
and
the
beast
said
margery
as
usual
that
evening
there
not
time
i
said
we
only
five
minutes
oh
then
tell
me
all
the
work
you
done
a
little
unkind
you
agree
but
you
know
what
relations
are
and
so
now
i
have
to
cram
the
record
of
my
day
work
into
five
breathless
minutes
you
will
understand
what
bare
justice
i
can
do
it
in
the
time
i
am
sorry
that
these
footnotes
have
grown
so
big
let
us
leave
them
and
return
to
the
letter
there
are
many
ways
of
answering
such
a
letter
one
might
say
my
dear
margery
it
was
jolly
to
get
a
real
letter
from
you
at
last
but
the
at
last
would
seem
rather
tactless
considering
what
had
passed
years
before
or
one
might
say
my
dear
margery
thank
you
for
your
jolly
letter
i
am
so
sorry
about
knee
and
so
glad
about
your
toys
perhaps
if
you
gave
one
of
the
toys
to
baby
then
her
knee
but
i
feel
sure
that
margery
would
expect
me
to
do
better
than
that
in
the
particular
case
of
this
last
letter
but
seven
i
wrote
dearest
margery
thank
you
for
your
sweet
letter
i
had
a
very
busy
day
at
the
office
or
i
would
have
come
to
see
you
transcriber
note
page
break
in
original
i
hope
to
be
down
next
week
and
then
i
will
tell
you
all
about
my
work
but
i
have
a
lot
more
to
do
now
and
so
i
must
say
your
loving
uncle
there
is
perhaps
nothing
in
that
which
demands
an
immediate
answer
but
with
businesslike
promptitude
margery
replied
my
dear
uncle
thank
you
for
your
letter
i
am
glad
you
are
coming
next
week
baby
is
quite
well
now
are
you
p
t
o
coming
on
thursday
next
week
or
not
say
yes
if
you
are
i
am
p
t
o
sorry
you
are
working
so
hard
from
your
loving
margie
i
said
yes
and
that
i
was
her
loving
uncle
it
seemed
to
be
then
too
late
for
a
but
i
got
one
in
and
put
on
the
back
love
to
baby
the
answer
came
by
return
of
post
my
dear
uncle
thank
you
for
your
letter
come
erly
on
p
t
o
thursday
come
at
half
past
nothing
baby
sends
her
love
and
so
do
p
t
o
i
my
roking
horse
has
a
sirrup
broken
isnt
that
a
pity
say
yes
or
no
from
your
loving
margie
of
course
i
thanked
baby
for
her
love
and
gave
my
decision
that
it
a
pity
about
the
i
did
it
in
large
capitals
which
as
i
ought
to
have
said
before
is
the
means
of
communication
between
margery
and
her
friends
for
some
reason
or
other
i
find
printing
capitals
to
be
more
tiring
than
the
ordinary
method
of
writing
my
dear
uncle
wrote
margery
but
we
need
not
go
into
that
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
i
love
to
get
letters
particularly
these
but
i
hate
writing
them
particularly
in
capitals
years
ago
i
used
to
answer
margery
letter
for
her
it
is
now
her
turn
to
answer
mine
for
me
ix
the
truth
about
home
rails
imagine
us
if
you
can
sitting
one
on
each
side
of
the
fire
i
with
my
feet
on
the
mantelpiece
margery
curled
up
in
the
blue
both
of
us
intent
on
the
morning
paper
to
me
by
good
chance
has
fallen
the
sporting
page
to
margery
the
foreign
political
and
financial
intelligence
of
the
day
what
said
margery
does
it
mean
when
it
says
she
stopped
and
spelt
it
over
to
herself
again
i
put
down
my
piece
of
the
paper
and
prepared
to
explain
the
desire
for
knowledge
in
the
young
can
not
be
too
strongly
encouraged
and
i
have
always
flattered
myself
that
i
can
explain
in
perfectly
simple
language
anything
which
a
child
wants
to
know
for
instance
i
once
told
margery
what
miniature
rifle
shooting
meant
it
was
a
which
she
had
come
across
in
her
paper
the
explanation
took
some
time
owing
to
margery
idea
that
a
bird
entered
into
it
somewhere
several
times
when
i
thought
the
lesson
was
over
she
said
well
what
about
the
bird
but
i
think
i
made
it
plain
to
her
in
the
end
though
maybe
she
has
forgotten
about
it
now
what
said
margery
does
it
mean
when
it
says
rails
firm
i
took
up
my
paper
again
the
cambridge
fifteen
i
was
glad
to
see
were
rapidly
developing
into
a
team
and
rails
firm
repeated
margery
and
looked
up
at
me
my
mind
worked
rapidly
as
it
always
does
in
a
crisis
what
did
you
say
i
asked
in
surprise
what
does
rails
firm
mean
where
does
it
say
that
i
went
on
still
thinking
at
lightning
speed
there
it
said
it
yesterday
too
ah
yes
i
made
up
my
mind
well
that
i
said
i
think
that
is
something
you
must
ask
your
father
i
did
ask
him
yesterday
well
then
he
told
me
to
ask
mummy
coward
you
can
be
sure
i
said
firmly
that
what
mummy
told
you
would
be
right
and
i
returned
to
my
paper
mummy
told
me
to
wait
till
came
really
these
parents
the
way
they
shirk
their
responsibilities
nowadays
is
disgusting
rails
firm
said
margery
and
settled
herself
to
listen
it
is
good
that
children
should
be
encouraged
to
take
an
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
day
but
i
do
think
that
a
little
girl
might
be
taught
by
its
father
or
if
more
convenient
mother
which
part
of
a
newspaper
to
read
had
margery
asked
me
the
difference
between
a
bunker
and
a
banker
had
she
demanded
an
explanation
of
ultimatum
or
guillotine
i
could
have
done
something
with
it
but
to
let
a
child
of
six
fill
her
head
with
ideas
as
to
the
firmness
or
otherwise
of
home
rails
is
hardly
nice
however
an
explanation
had
to
be
given
well
it
like
this
margery
i
said
at
last
supposing
well
you
see
supposing
that
is
to
say
if
i
and
then
i
stopped
i
had
a
sort
of
feeling
intuition
they
call
it
that
i
was
beginning
in
the
wrong
way
go
on
said
margery
perhaps
i
had
better
put
it
this
way
supposing
you
were
to
well
we
better
begin
further
back
than
that
you
know
what
no
i
suppose
you
do
know
that
well
if
i
that
is
to
say
when
a
man
you
know
it
rather
difficult
to
explain
this
margery
are
you
explaining
it
now
i
just
going
to
begin
thank
you
uncle
i
lit
my
pipe
slowly
while
i
considered
again
how
best
to
approach
the
matter
rails
firm
said
margery
is
it
a
thing
to
say
it
was
it
was
a
very
silly
thing
to
say
whoever
said
it
first
might
have
known
what
it
would
lead
to
perhaps
i
can
explain
it
best
like
this
margery
i
said
beginning
on
a
new
tack
i
suppose
you
know
what
means
what
does
it
mean
ah
well
if
you
do
know
that
i
said
rather
pleased
perhaps
i
had
better
explain
that
first
means
that
that
is
to
say
you
call
a
thing
firm
if
it
well
if
it
does
that
is
to
say
a
thing
is
firm
if
it
ca
move
like
a
house
well
something
like
that
this
chair
for
instance
and
i
put
my
hand
on
her
chair
is
firm
because
you
ca
shake
it
you
see
quite
hallo
what
that
oh
you
bad
uncle
you
knocked
the
castor
off
again
cried
margery
greatly
excited
at
the
incident
this
is
too
much
i
said
bitterly
even
the
furniture
is
against
me
go
on
explaining
said
margery
rocking
herself
in
the
now
wobbly
chair
i
decided
to
leave
firm
it
is
not
an
easy
word
to
explain
at
the
best
of
times
and
when
everything
you
touch
goes
and
breaks
itself
it
becomes
perfectly
impossible
well
so
much
for
that
i
said
and
now
we
come
to
you
know
what
rails
are
like
i
got
in
the
nursery
this
was
splendid
i
had
forgotten
these
for
the
moment
exactly
the
rails
your
train
goes
on
well
then
rails
would
be
rails
at
home
well
i
got
them
at
home
said
margery
in
surprise
i
have
them
anywhere
else
quite
so
then
rails
firm
would
mean
that
er
home
rails
were
er
firm
but
mine
are
because
they
wobble
you
know
they
do
yes
but
well
why
do
they
say
rails
firm
when
they
mean
rails
wobble
ah
that
just
it
the
point
is
that
when
they
say
rails
firm
they
do
mean
that
the
rails
themselves
are
firm
in
fact
they
mean
at
all
what
you
think
they
mean
they
mean
something
quite
different
what
do
they
mean
i
am
just
going
to
explain
i
said
stiffly
or
perhaps
i
had
better
put
it
this
way
i
said
ten
minutes
later
supposing
oh
margery
it
is
difficult
to
explain
i
must
know
said
margery
why
do
you
want
to
know
so
badly
i
want
to
know
a
million
million
times
more
than
anything
else
in
the
whole
world
why
so
as
i
can
tell
angela
said
margery
i
plunged
into
my
explanation
again
angela
is
three
and
i
can
quite
see
how
important
it
is
that
she
should
be
sound
on
the
question
life
little
tragedies
x
a
crown
of
sorrows
there
is
something
on
my
mind
of
which
i
must
relieve
myself
if
i
am
ever
to
face
the
world
again
with
a
smile
i
must
share
my
trouble
with
others
i
can
not
bear
my
burden
alone
friends
i
have
lost
my
hat
will
the
gentleman
who
took
it
by
mistake
and
forgot
to
leave
his
own
in
its
place
kindly
return
my
hat
to
me
at
once
i
am
very
miserable
without
my
hat
it
was
one
of
those
nice
soft
ones
with
a
dent
down
the
middle
to
collect
the
rain
one
of
those
soft
hats
which
wrap
themselves
so
lovingly
round
the
cranium
that
they
ultimately
absorb
the
personality
of
the
wearer
underneath
responding
to
his
every
emotion
when
people
said
nice
things
about
me
my
hat
would
swell
in
sympathy
when
they
said
nasty
things
or
when
i
had
had
my
hair
cut
it
would
adapt
itself
automatically
to
my
lesser
requirements
in
a
word
it
fitted
and
that
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
your
hard
unyielding
bowler
my
hat
and
i
dropped
into
a
hall
of
music
one
night
last
week
i
placed
it
under
the
seat
put
a
coat
on
it
to
keep
it
warm
and
settled
down
to
enjoy
myself
my
hat
could
see
nothing
but
it
knew
that
it
would
hear
all
about
the
entertainment
on
the
way
home
when
the
last
moving
picture
had
moved
away
my
hat
and
i
prepared
to
depart
together
i
drew
out
the
coat
and
felt
around
for
my
where
on
earth
i
was
calm
at
first
excuse
me
i
said
politely
to
the
man
next
to
me
but
have
you
got
two
hats
several
he
replied
mistaking
my
meaning
i
dived
under
the
seat
again
and
came
up
with
some
more
dust
some
one
i
said
to
the
programme
girl
has
taken
my
hat
have
you
looked
under
the
seat
for
it
she
asked
it
was
such
a
sound
suggestion
that
i
went
under
the
seat
for
the
third
time
it
may
have
been
kicked
further
along
suggested
another
attendant
she
walked
up
and
down
the
row
looking
for
it
and
in
case
somebody
had
kicked
it
into
the
row
above
walked
up
and
down
that
one
too
and
in
case
somebody
had
kicked
it
on
to
the
other
side
of
the
house
many
other
girls
spread
themselves
in
pursuit
and
soon
we
had
the
whole
pack
hunting
for
it
then
the
fireman
came
up
suspecting
the
worst
i
told
him
it
was
even
worse
than
that
my
hat
had
been
stolen
he
had
a
flash
of
inspiration
are
you
sure
you
brought
it
with
you
he
asked
the
programme
girls
seemed
to
think
that
it
would
solve
the
whole
mystery
if
i
had
brought
it
with
me
are
you
sure
you
are
the
fireman
i
said
coldly
he
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
unburdened
himself
of
another
idea
perhaps
it
just
been
kicked
under
the
seat
he
said
i
left
him
under
the
seat
and
went
downstairs
with
a
heavy
heart
at
the
door
i
said
to
the
hall
porter
have
you
seen
anybody
going
out
with
two
hats
by
mistake
what
the
matter
he
said
lost
your
hat
it
has
been
stolen
have
you
looked
under
the
seats
it
may
have
been
kicked
along
a
bit
perhaps
i
better
see
the
manager
i
said
is
it
any
good
looking
under
the
seats
for
i
expect
it
just
been
kicked
along
a
bit
the
hall
porter
repeated
confidently
i
come
up
with
you
and
look
for
it
if
there
any
more
talk
about
being
kicked
along
a
bit
i
said
bitterly
somebody
be
i
want
the
manager
i
was
led
to
the
manager
room
and
there
i
explained
the
matter
to
him
he
was
very
pleasant
about
it
i
expect
you
have
looked
for
it
properly
he
said
with
a
charming
smile
just
take
this
gentleman
up
he
added
to
the
hall
porter
and
find
his
hat
for
him
it
has
probably
been
kicked
under
one
of
the
other
seats
we
were
smiled
irresistibly
out
and
i
was
dragged
up
to
the
grand
circle
again
the
seats
by
this
time
were
laid
out
in
white
draperies
the
house
looked
very
desolate
i
knew
that
my
poor
hat
was
dead
with
an
air
of
cheery
confidence
the
hall
porter
turned
into
the
first
row
of
seats
it
may
have
been
kicked
on
to
the
stage
i
said
as
he
began
to
slow
down
it
may
have
jumped
into
one
of
the
boxes
it
may
have
turned
into
a
rabbit
you
know
i
expect
you
are
looking
for
it
properly
the
manager
was
extremely
sympathetic
when
we
came
back
to
him
he
said
oh
i
sorry
just
like
that
oh
i
sorry
my
hat
i
said
firmly
has
been
stolen
i
sorry
he
repeated
with
a
bored
smile
and
turned
to
look
at
himself
in
the
glass
then
i
became
angry
with
him
and
his
attendants
and
his
whole
blessed
theatre
my
hat
i
said
bitingly
has
been
stolen
from
me
while
i
slept
you
must
have
seen
me
wearing
it
in
the
dear
old
days
greeny
brown
it
was
in
colour
but
it
was
the
colour
that
drew
your
eyes
to
it
no
nor
yet
the
shape
nor
the
angle
at
which
it
sat
it
was
just
the
essential
rightness
of
it
if
you
have
ever
seen
a
hat
which
you
felt
instinctively
was
a
clever
hat
an
alive
hat
a
profound
hat
then
that
was
my
hat
and
that
was
myself
underneath
it
xi
the
lucky
month
know
thyself
said
the
old
greek
motto
in
greek
but
this
is
an
english
book
so
i
bought
a
little
red
volume
called
tersely
enough
you
born
in
january
i
was
and
reassured
on
this
point
the
author
told
me
all
about
myself
for
the
most
part
he
told
me
nothing
new
you
are
he
said
in
effect
courageous
ambitious
loyal
quick
to
resent
wrong
an
excellent
and
a
leader
of
men
true
generous
to
a
fault
yes
i
was
overdoing
that
rather
you
have
a
ready
sympathy
with
the
distressed
people
born
in
this
month
will
always
keep
their
promises
and
so
on
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
author
had
the
idea
all
right
even
when
he
went
on
to
warn
me
of
my
weaknesses
he
maintained
the
correct
note
people
born
in
january
he
said
must
be
on
their
guard
against
working
too
strenuously
their
extraordinarily
active
brains
well
you
see
what
he
means
it
a
fault
perhaps
and
i
shall
be
more
careful
in
future
mind
i
do
not
take
offence
with
him
for
calling
my
attention
to
it
in
fact
my
only
objection
to
the
book
is
its
surface
application
to
the
people
who
were
born
in
january
there
should
have
been
more
distinction
made
between
me
and
the
rabble
i
have
said
that
he
told
me
little
that
was
new
in
one
matter
however
he
did
open
my
eyes
he
introduced
me
to
an
aspect
of
myself
entirely
unsuspected
they
he
said
meaning
me
have
unusual
business
capacity
and
are
destined
to
be
leaders
in
great
commercial
enterprises
one
gets
at
times
these
flashes
of
in
an
instant
i
realised
how
wasted
my
life
had
been
in
an
instant
i
resolved
that
here
and
now
i
would
put
my
great
gifts
to
their
proper
uses
i
would
be
a
leader
in
an
immense
commercial
enterprise
one
can
not
start
commercial
enterprises
without
capital
the
first
thing
was
to
determine
the
exact
nature
of
my
balance
at
the
bank
this
was
a
matter
for
the
bank
to
arrange
and
i
drove
there
rapidly
good
morning
i
said
to
the
cashier
i
am
in
rather
a
hurry
may
i
have
my
he
assented
and
retired
after
an
interminable
wait
during
which
many
psychological
moments
for
commercial
enterprise
must
have
lapsed
he
returned
i
think
have
it
he
said
shortly
thank
you
i
replied
and
drove
rapidly
home
again
a
lengthy
search
followed
but
after
an
hour
of
it
one
of
those
flashes
of
thought
such
as
only
occur
to
the
natural
business
genius
seared
my
mind
and
sent
me
to
the
bank
again
after
all
i
said
to
the
cashier
i
only
want
to
know
my
balance
what
is
it
he
withdrew
and
gave
himself
up
to
calculation
i
paced
the
floor
impatiently
opportunities
were
slipping
by
at
last
he
pushed
a
slip
of
paper
across
at
me
my
balance
it
was
in
four
figures
unfortunately
two
of
them
were
shillings
and
pence
still
there
was
a
matter
of
fifty
pounds
odd
as
well
and
fortunes
have
been
built
up
on
less
out
in
the
street
i
had
a
moment
pause
hitherto
i
had
regarded
my
commercial
enterprise
in
the
bulk
as
a
finished
monument
of
industry
the
little
niggling
preliminary
details
had
not
come
up
for
consideration
just
for
a
second
i
wondered
how
to
begin
only
for
a
second
an
unsuspected
talent
which
has
long
lain
dormant
needs
when
waked
a
second
or
so
to
turn
round
in
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
had
made
up
my
mind
i
knew
exactly
what
i
would
do
i
would
ring
up
my
solicitor
hallo
is
that
you
yes
this
is
me
what
yes
awfully
thanks
how
are
you
good
look
here
come
and
lunch
with
me
what
no
at
once
business
particularly
that
sort
of
commercial
enterprise
to
which
i
had
now
decided
to
lend
my
genius
can
only
be
discussed
properly
over
a
cigar
during
the
meal
itself
my
solicitor
and
i
indulged
in
the
ordinary
of
the
world
you
looking
very
fit
said
my
solicitor
no
not
fat
you
do
think
i
looking
thin
i
asked
anxiously
people
are
warning
me
that
i
may
be
overdoing
it
rather
they
tell
me
that
i
must
be
seriously
on
my
guard
against
brain
strain
i
suppose
they
think
you
ought
to
strain
it
too
suddenly
said
my
solicitor
though
he
is
now
a
solicitor
he
was
once
just
an
ordinary
boy
like
the
rest
of
us
and
it
was
in
those
days
that
he
acquired
the
habit
of
being
rude
to
me
a
habit
he
has
never
quite
forgotten
what
is
an
onyx
i
said
changing
the
conversation
why
asked
my
solicitor
with
his
usual
business
acumen
well
i
was
practically
certain
that
i
had
seen
one
in
the
zoo
in
the
reptile
house
but
i
have
just
learnt
that
it
is
my
lucky
month
stone
naturally
i
want
to
get
one
the
coffee
came
and
we
settled
down
to
commerce
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you
said
my
solicitor
have
you
any
money
lying
idle
at
the
bank
because
if
so
whatever
else
it
is
doing
it
is
lying
idle
i
protested
i
was
at
the
bank
and
there
were
men
chivying
it
about
with
shovels
all
the
time
well
how
much
have
you
got
about
fifty
pounds
it
ought
to
be
more
than
that
that
what
i
say
but
you
know
what
those
banks
are
actual
merit
counts
for
nothing
with
them
well
what
did
you
want
to
do
with
it
exactly
that
was
why
i
rang
you
up
i
er
this
was
really
my
moment
but
somehow
i
was
not
quite
ready
to
seize
it
my
vast
commercial
enterprise
still
lacked
a
few
trifling
details
er
i
well
it
like
that
i
might
get
you
a
few
ground
rents
do
i
should
know
where
to
put
them
but
if
you
really
have
fifty
pounds
simply
lying
idle
i
wish
you
lend
it
to
me
for
a
bit
i
confoundedly
hard
up
to
a
fault
you
have
a
ready
sympathy
with
the
dash
it
what
could
i
do
is
it
quite
etiquette
for
clients
to
lend
solicitors
money
i
asked
i
thought
it
was
always
solicitors
who
had
to
lend
it
to
clients
if
i
must
i
rather
lend
it
to
you
i
mean
i
dislike
it
less
as
to
the
old
friend
of
my
childhood
yes
that
how
i
wanted
to
pay
it
back
bother
then
i
send
you
a
cheque
i
sighed
and
that
where
we
are
at
the
moment
born
in
this
month
always
keep
their
the
money
has
got
to
go
if
i
had
been
born
in
january
i
should
be
sending
it
i
certainly
should
have
promised
it
i
should
even
have
known
that
i
had
it
sometimes
i
almost
wish
that
i
had
been
born
in
one
of
the
decent
months
march
say
xii
the
rescue
william
bales
as
nice
a
young
man
as
ever
wore
a
cummerbund
on
an
esplanade
was
in
despair
for
he
and
miss
spratt
had
been
sitting
in
silence
on
the
pier
and
it
was
still
william
turn
to
say
something
miss
spratt
last
remark
had
been
oh
bales
you
do
say
things
and
william
felt
that
his
next
observation
must
at
all
costs
live
up
to
the
standard
set
for
it
three
or
four
times
he
had
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
then
on
second
thoughts
had
rejected
the
intended
utterance
as
unworthy
at
the
end
of
his
mind
was
still
working
fruitlessly
he
knew
that
the
longer
he
waited
the
more
brilliant
he
would
have
to
be
and
he
told
himself
that
even
bernard
shaw
or
one
of
those
clever
writing
fellows
would
have
been
hard
put
to
it
now
william
was
at
odds
with
the
world
he
was
a
romantic
young
man
who
had
once
been
told
that
he
nearly
looked
like
lewis
waller
when
he
frowned
and
he
had
resolved
that
his
holiday
this
year
should
be
a
very
dashing
affair
indeed
he
had
chosen
the
sea
in
the
hopes
that
some
old
gentleman
would
fall
off
the
pier
and
let
himself
be
saved
by
and
later
on
photographed
with
william
bales
who
in
a
subsequent
interview
would
modestly
refuse
to
take
any
credit
for
the
gallant
rescue
as
his
holiday
had
progressed
he
had
felt
the
need
for
some
such
old
gentleman
more
and
more
for
only
thus
he
realised
could
he
capture
the
heart
of
the
wayward
miss
spratt
but
so
far
it
had
been
a
dull
season
in
a
whole
fortnight
nobody
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
oblige
william
and
he
must
return
to
the
city
as
unknown
and
as
unloved
as
when
he
left
it
got
to
go
back
he
said
at
last
as
an
impromptu
it
would
have
served
but
as
the
result
of
earnest
thought
he
felt
that
it
did
not
do
him
justice
so
you
said
before
remarked
miss
spratt
well
it
still
true
talking
about
it
wo
help
it
said
miss
spratt
william
sighed
and
looked
round
the
pier
there
was
an
old
gentleman
fishing
at
the
end
of
it
his
back
turned
invitingly
to
william
in
he
had
caught
one
small
fish
which
he
had
had
to
return
as
under
the
age
limit
and
a
bunch
of
seaweed
william
felt
that
here
was
a
wasted
life
a
life
however
which
a
sudden
kick
and
a
heroic
rescue
by
bales
might
yet
do
something
to
justify
at
the
paddington
baths
a
month
ago
he
had
won
a
competition
and
though
there
is
a
difference
between
diving
for
plates
and
diving
for
old
gentlemen
he
was
prepared
to
waive
it
one
kick
and
then
fame
and
not
only
fame
but
the
admiration
of
angelina
spratt
it
was
perhaps
as
well
for
the
old
gentleman
who
was
really
quite
worthy
and
an
hour
later
caught
a
whiting
that
miss
spratt
spoke
at
this
moment
well
you
good
company
i
must
say
she
observed
to
william
it
so
hot
said
william
you
ca
say
i
asked
to
come
here
let
go
on
the
beach
said
william
desperately
we
can
find
a
shady
cave
or
something
fate
was
against
him
there
was
to
be
no
rescue
that
day
i
sure
i
agreeable
said
miss
spratt
they
walked
in
silence
along
the
beach
and
rounding
a
corner
of
the
cliffs
they
came
presently
to
a
cave
in
earlier
days
bales
could
have
done
desperate
deeds
against
smugglers
there
with
miss
spratt
looking
on
alas
for
this
unromantic
age
it
was
now
a
place
for
picnics
and
a
crumpled
sheet
of
newspaper
on
the
sand
showed
that
there
had
been
one
there
that
very
afternoon
they
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
cave
out
of
the
sun
out
of
sight
of
the
sea
and
william
prepared
to
renew
his
efforts
as
a
conversationalist
in
the
hope
of
collecting
a
few
ideas
as
to
what
the
london
clubs
were
talking
about
he
picked
up
the
discarded
newspaper
and
saw
with
disgust
that
it
was
the
local
but
just
as
he
threw
it
down
a
line
in
it
caught
his
eye
and
remained
in
his
mind
tide
william
heart
leapt
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
in
one
hour
the
waves
would
be
dashing
remorselessly
into
the
cave
would
be
leaping
up
the
cliff
what
time
he
and
miss
spratt
suppose
they
were
caught
by
the
tide
meanwhile
the
lady
despairing
of
entertainment
had
removed
her
hat
really
she
said
i
that
sleepy
i
suppose
the
tide
safe
mr
bales
it
was
william
chance
quite
quite
safe
he
said
earnestly
it
going
down
hard
well
then
i
almost
think
she
closed
her
eyes
wake
me
up
when
you
thought
of
something
really
funny
mr
bales
william
was
left
alone
with
romance
he
went
out
of
the
cave
and
looked
round
the
sea
was
still
some
way
out
but
it
came
up
quickly
on
this
coast
in
an
hour
in
an
hour
he
scanned
the
cliffs
and
saw
the
ledge
whither
he
would
drag
her
she
would
cling
to
him
crying
calling
him
her
rescuer
what
should
he
do
then
should
he
leave
her
and
swim
for
help
or
should
he
scale
the
mighty
cliff
he
returned
to
the
cave
and
gazing
romantically
at
the
sleeping
miss
spratt
conjured
up
the
scene
it
would
go
like
this
he
thought
spratt
wakened
by
the
spray
dashing
over
her
face
oh
bales
we
cut
off
by
the
tide
save
me
bales
lightly
there
no
danger
it
nothing
great
heavens
death
stares
us
in
the
face
spratt
throwing
her
arms
around
his
neck
william
save
me
i
can
not
swim
bales
with
waller
face
trust
me
angelina
i
will
fight
my
way
round
yon
point
and
obtain
help
an
englishman
can
only
die
once
do
leave
me
fear
not
sweetheart
see
there
is
a
ledge
where
you
will
be
beyond
the
reach
of
the
hungry
tide
i
will
carry
you
thither
in
my
arms
and
will
then
at
this
point
in
his
william
took
another
look
at
the
sleeping
miss
spratt
felt
his
biceps
doubtfully
and
went
on
i
will
assist
you
to
climb
thither
and
will
then
swim
for
help
my
hero
again
and
again
william
reviewed
the
scene
to
himself
it
was
perfect
his
photograph
would
be
in
the
papers
miss
spratt
would
worship
him
he
would
be
a
hero
in
his
city
office
the
actual
danger
was
slight
for
at
the
worst
she
could
shelter
in
the
far
end
of
the
cave
but
he
would
not
let
her
know
this
he
would
do
the
thing
heroically
drag
her
to
the
ledge
on
the
cliff
and
then
swim
round
the
point
to
obtain
help
the
thought
struck
him
that
he
could
conduct
the
scene
better
in
his
shirt
sleeves
he
removed
his
coat
and
then
went
out
of
the
cave
to
reconnoitre
the
ledge
miss
spratt
awoke
with
a
start
and
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
the
cave
was
empty
save
for
a
crumpled
page
of
newspaper
she
glanced
at
this
idly
and
saw
that
it
was
the
local
eight
days
old
far
away
on
the
horizon
william
bales
was
throwing
stones
bitterly
at
the
still
retreating
sea
xiii
the
portuguese
cigar
everything
promised
well
for
my
with
charles
the
weather
was
warm
and
sunny
i
was
bringing
my
golf
clubs
down
with
me
and
i
had
just
discovered
and
meant
to
put
into
practice
an
entirely
new
stance
which
made
it
impossible
to
miss
the
object
ball
it
was
this
that
i
was
explaining
to
charles
and
his
wife
at
dinner
on
friday
when
the
interruption
occurred
by
the
way
said
charles
as
i
took
out
a
cigarette
i
got
a
cigar
for
you
do
smoke
that
thing
you
have
let
him
go
in
for
cigars
i
said
reproachfully
to
charles
i
can
be
very
firm
about
other
people
extravagances
this
is
one
i
picked
up
in
portugal
explained
charles
you
can
get
them
absurdly
cheap
out
there
let
see
dear
where
did
i
put
it
i
saw
it
on
your
last
week
said
his
wife
getting
up
to
leave
us
he
followed
her
out
and
went
in
search
of
it
while
i
waited
with
an
interest
which
i
made
no
effort
to
conceal
i
had
never
heard
before
of
a
man
going
all
the
way
to
portugal
to
buy
one
cigar
for
a
friend
here
it
is
said
charles
coming
in
again
he
put
down
in
front
of
me
an
the
matches
and
a
and
a
well
a
cigar
i
examined
it
slowly
half
of
it
looked
very
tired
well
said
charles
what
do
you
think
of
it
when
you
say
you
er
it
in
portugal
i
began
carefully
i
suppose
you
do
mean
i
stopped
and
tried
to
bite
the
end
off
have
a
knife
said
charles
i
had
another
bite
and
then
i
decided
to
be
frank
did
you
pick
it
up
i
asked
the
fact
was
said
charles
i
found
myself
one
day
in
lisbon
without
my
pipe
and
so
i
bought
that
thing
i
never
smoke
them
in
the
ordinary
way
did
you
smoke
this
i
asked
it
was
obvious
that
had
happened
to
it
no
you
see
i
found
some
cigarettes
at
the
last
moment
and
so
knowing
that
you
liked
cigars
i
thought
i
bring
it
home
for
you
it
very
nice
of
you
charles
of
course
i
can
see
that
it
has
travelled
well
we
must
do
what
we
can
with
it
i
took
the
knife
and
started
chipping
away
at
the
mahogany
end
the
other
end
the
end
which
had
come
ungummed
i
intended
to
reserve
for
the
match
when
everything
was
ready
i
applied
a
light
leant
back
in
my
chair
and
pulled
that
all
right
is
it
said
charles
you
be
surprised
if
i
told
you
what
i
paid
for
it
no
no
you
must
think
that
i
protested
probably
things
are
dearer
in
portugal
i
put
it
down
by
my
plate
for
a
moment
rest
all
i
got
against
it
at
present
is
that
its
pores
do
act
as
freely
as
they
should
i
got
a
somewhere
if
no
do
bother
i
think
i
can
do
it
with
the
there
no
doubt
it
was
a
good
cigar
once
but
it
has
wintered
well
i
squeezed
it
as
hard
as
i
could
lit
it
again
pressed
my
feet
against
the
table
and
pulled
now
it
going
said
charles
i
afraid
it
keeps
very
reticent
at
my
end
the
is
poor
is
your
end
alight
still
burning
beautifully
it
a
pity
that
i
should
be
missing
all
that
how
would
it
be
if
we
were
to
make
a
and
bore
a
tunnel
from
this
end
we
might
establish
a
draught
that
way
only
there
always
the
danger
of
course
of
coming
out
at
the
side
i
took
the
cigar
up
and
put
it
to
my
ear
i
ca
hear
anything
wrong
i
said
i
expect
what
it
really
wants
is
massage
charles
filled
his
pipe
again
and
got
up
let
go
for
a
stroll
he
said
it
a
beautiful
night
bring
your
cigar
with
you
it
may
prefer
the
open
air
i
said
there
always
that
you
know
we
must
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
portuguese
climate
is
different
from
ours
the
thing
pores
may
have
acted
more
readily
in
the
south
on
the
other
hand
the
unfastened
end
may
have
been
more
adhesive
i
gather
that
though
you
have
never
actually
met
anybody
who
has
smoked
a
cigar
like
this
yet
you
understand
that
the
experiment
is
a
practicable
one
as
far
as
you
know
this
had
no
brothers
no
no
charles
i
going
on
with
it
but
i
should
like
to
know
all
that
you
can
tell
me
of
its
parentage
it
had
a
portuguese
father
and
an
american
mother
i
should
say
and
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
trouble
in
the
family
one
moment
and
as
we
went
outside
i
stopped
and
cracked
it
in
the
door
it
was
an
inspiration
at
the
very
next
application
of
the
match
i
found
that
i
had
established
a
connection
with
the
lighted
end
not
a
long
and
steady
connection
but
one
that
came
in
gusts
after
two
gusts
i
decided
that
it
was
perhaps
safer
to
blow
from
my
end
and
for
a
little
while
we
had
in
this
way
as
much
smoke
around
us
as
the
most
fastidious
could
want
then
i
accidentally
dropped
it
something
in
the
middle
of
it
shifted
i
suppose
and
for
the
rest
of
my
stay
behind
it
only
one
end
was
at
work
well
said
charles
when
we
were
back
in
the
and
i
was
giving
the
cigar
a
short
breather
it
not
a
bad
one
is
it
i
have
enjoyed
it
i
said
truthfully
for
i
like
trying
to
get
the
mastery
over
a
thing
that
defies
me
you
never
guess
what
it
cost
he
chuckled
tell
me
i
said
i
dare
guess
well
in
english
money
it
works
out
at
exactly
three
farthings
i
looked
at
him
for
a
long
time
and
then
shook
my
head
sadly
charles
old
friend
i
said
you
been
done
xiv
a
cold
world
herbert
is
a
man
who
knows
all
about
railway
tickets
and
packing
and
being
in
time
for
trains
and
things
like
that
but
i
fancy
i
have
taught
him
a
lesson
at
last
he
wo
talk
quite
so
much
about
tickets
in
future
i
was
just
thinking
about
getting
up
when
he
came
into
my
room
he
looked
at
me
in
horror
my
dear
fellow
he
said
and
you
have
even
packed
you
be
late
here
get
up
and
i
pack
for
you
while
you
dress
do
i
said
briefly
first
of
all
what
clothes
are
you
going
to
travel
in
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
directed
operations
right
said
herbert
now
what
about
your
return
ticket
you
forget
that
you
remind
me
of
a
little
story
i
said
i
tell
it
you
while
you
pack
that
will
be
nice
for
you
once
upon
a
time
i
lost
my
return
ticket
and
i
had
to
pay
two
pounds
for
another
and
a
month
afterwards
i
met
a
man
a
man
like
you
who
knows
all
about
tickets
and
he
said
could
have
got
the
money
back
if
you
had
applied
at
once
so
i
said
me
a
cigarette
now
and
i
transfer
all
my
rights
in
the
business
to
you
and
he
gave
me
a
cigarette
but
unfortunately
it
was
too
late
no
unfortunately
it
was
he
got
the
two
pounds
the
most
expensive
cigarette
i
ever
smoked
well
that
just
shows
you
said
herbert
here
your
ticket
put
it
in
your
waistcoat
pocket
now
but
i
have
got
a
waistcoat
on
silly
which
one
are
you
going
to
put
on
i
do
know
yet
this
is
a
matter
which
requires
thought
give
me
time
give
me
air
well
i
shall
put
the
ticket
here
on
the
and
then
you
ca
miss
it
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
the
trap
starts
in
half
an
hour
help
i
cried
and
i
leapt
out
of
bed
half
an
hour
later
i
was
saying
to
herbert
i
had
an
awfully
jolly
time
i
said
and
i
come
again
you
got
the
ticket
all
right
rather
and
i
drove
away
amidst
cheers
cheers
of
sorrow
it
was
drive
to
the
station
for
the
first
five
minutes
i
thought
how
sickening
it
was
to
be
leaving
the
country
then
i
had
a
slight
shock
and
for
the
next
minutes
i
tried
to
remember
how
much
a
third
single
to
the
nearest
part
of
london
cost
because
i
had
left
my
ticket
on
the
after
all
i
gave
my
luggage
to
a
porter
and
went
off
to
the
i
wonder
if
you
can
help
me
i
said
i
left
my
ticket
on
the
dress
well
we
need
worry
about
that
i
left
it
at
home
he
did
seem
intensely
excited
what
did
you
think
of
doing
he
asked
i
had
rather
hoped
that
would
do
something
you
can
buy
another
ticket
and
get
the
money
back
afterwards
yes
yes
but
can
i
i
only
got
about
one
pound
six
the
fare
to
london
is
one
pound
five
and
tenpence
ah
well
that
leaves
a
penny
to
be
divided
between
the
porter
this
end
lunch
tea
the
porter
the
other
end
and
the
cab
i
believe
it
enough
even
if
i
gave
it
all
to
the
porter
here
think
how
reproachfully
he
would
look
at
you
ever
afterwards
it
would
haunt
you
the
was
evidently
moved
he
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
if
i
knew
anybody
who
would
vouch
for
me
i
mentioned
herbert
confidently
he
had
never
even
heard
of
herbert
i
got
a
i
said
have
a
weakness
for
and
a
watch
and
a
cigarette
case
i
shall
be
happy
to
lend
you
any
of
those
the
idea
did
appeal
to
him
the
best
thing
you
can
do
he
said
is
to
take
a
ticket
to
the
next
station
and
talk
to
them
there
this
is
only
a
branch
line
and
i
have
no
power
to
give
you
a
pass
so
that
was
what
i
had
to
do
i
began
to
see
myself
taking
a
ticket
at
every
stop
and
appealing
to
the
at
the
next
well
the
money
would
last
longer
that
way
but
unless
i
could
overcome
quickly
the
distrust
which
i
seemed
to
inspire
in
there
would
not
be
much
left
for
lunch
i
gave
the
porter
all
i
could
afford
a
mentioned
apologetically
that
i
was
coming
back
and
stepped
into
the
train
at
the
junction
i
jumped
out
quickly
and
dived
into
the
sacred
office
i
left
my
ticket
on
the
dressing
that
is
to
say
i
forgot
well
anyhow
i
have
got
it
i
began
and
we
plunged
into
explanations
once
more
this
was
even
more
unemotional
than
the
last
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
anybody
who
could
vouch
for
me
i
mentioned
herbert
diffidently
he
had
never
even
heard
of
herbert
i
showed
him
my
gold
watch
my
silver
cigarette
case
and
my
emerald
and
diamond
that
was
the
sort
of
man
i
was
the
best
thing
you
can
do
he
said
walking
with
me
to
the
door
is
to
take
a
ticket
to
plymouth
and
speak
to
the
there
this
is
a
most
interesting
game
i
said
bitterly
what
is
when
you
speak
to
the
at
london
i
suppose
i
a
good
mind
to
say
extremely
annoyed
i
strode
out
and
bumped
into
you
never
guess
herbert
ah
here
you
are
he
panted
i
rode
after
you
the
train
was
just
going
jumped
into
it
been
looking
all
over
the
station
for
you
it
awfully
nice
of
you
herbert
did
i
say
your
ticket
he
produced
it
left
it
on
the
he
took
a
deep
breath
i
told
you
you
would
bless
you
i
said
as
i
got
happily
into
my
train
you
saved
my
life
i
had
an
awful
time
i
say
do
you
know
i
met
two
already
this
morning
who
never
even
heard
of
you
you
must
enquire
into
it
at
that
moment
a
porter
came
up
did
you
give
up
your
ticket
sir
he
asked
herbert
i
had
time
to
get
one
said
herbert
quite
at
his
ease
i
pay
now
and
he
began
to
feel
in
his
pockets
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
a
look
of
horror
came
over
herbert
face
i
knew
what
it
meant
he
had
any
money
on
him
hi
he
shouted
to
me
and
then
we
swung
round
a
bend
out
of
sight
well
well
he
have
to
get
home
somehow
his
watch
is
only
nickel
and
his
cigarette
case
leather
but
luckily
that
sort
of
thing
does
weigh
much
with
what
they
want
is
a
name
as
a
reference
herbert
is
better
off
than
i
was
he
can
give
them
name
it
will
be
idle
for
them
to
pretend
that
they
have
never
heard
of
xv
a
breath
of
life
this
is
the
story
of
a
comedy
which
nearly
became
a
tragedy
in
its
way
it
is
rather
a
pathetic
story
the
comedy
was
called
the
wooing
of
winifred
it
was
written
by
an
author
whose
name
i
forget
produced
by
the
and
as
his
press
agent
has
often
told
us
popular
levinski
and
played
by
among
others
that
very
charming
young
man
prosper
vane
known
locally
as
alfred
briggs
until
he
took
to
the
stage
prosper
played
the
young
hero
who
was
actually
wooing
levinski
himself
took
the
part
of
a
man
of
the
world
with
a
slight
embonpoint
down
in
the
programme
as
geoffrey
but
fortunately
still
levinski
his
opening
words
as
he
came
on
were
ah
dick
i
have
a
note
for
you
somewhere
which
gave
the
audience
an
interval
in
which
to
welcome
him
while
he
felt
in
all
his
pockets
for
the
letter
one
can
bow
quite
easily
while
feeling
in
pockets
and
it
is
much
more
natural
than
stopping
in
the
middle
of
an
important
speech
in
order
to
acknowledge
any
cheers
the
realisation
of
this
by
a
dramatist
is
what
is
called
stagecraft
in
this
case
the
audience
could
tell
at
once
that
the
technique
of
the
author
whose
name
unfortunately
i
forget
was
going
to
be
all
right
but
perhaps
i
had
better
describe
the
whole
play
as
shortly
as
possible
the
theme
as
one
guessed
from
the
title
even
before
the
curtain
rose
was
the
wooing
of
in
the
first
act
proposed
to
and
was
refused
by
her
not
from
lack
of
love
but
for
fear
lest
she
might
spoil
his
career
he
being
one
of
those
men
with
a
to
whom
the
open
spaces
of
the
world
call
loudly
whereupon
levinski
took
on
one
side
and
told
the
audience
how
when
he
had
been
a
young
man
some
good
woman
had
refused
him
for
a
similar
reason
and
had
been
miserable
ever
since
accordingly
in
the
second
act
withdrew
her
refusal
and
offered
to
marry
who
declined
to
take
advantage
of
her
offer
for
fear
that
she
was
willing
to
marry
him
from
pity
rather
than
from
love
whereupon
levinski
took
on
one
side
and
told
the
audience
how
when
had
been
a
young
man
he
had
refused
to
marry
some
good
woman
a
different
one
for
a
similar
reason
and
had
been
ever
afterwards
in
the
third
act
it
really
seemed
as
though
they
were
coming
together
at
last
for
at
the
beginning
of
it
levinski
took
them
both
aside
and
told
the
audience
a
parable
about
a
butterfly
and
a
which
was
both
pretty
and
helpful
and
caused
several
ladies
in
the
first
and
second
rows
of
the
upper
circle
to
say
what
a
nice
man
levinski
must
be
at
home
dear
the
purport
of
the
allegory
being
to
show
that
both
and
were
being
very
silly
as
indeed
by
this
time
everybody
but
the
author
was
aware
unfortunately
at
that
moment
a
footman
entered
with
a
telegram
for
which
announced
that
she
had
been
left
fifty
thousand
pounds
by
a
dead
uncle
in
australia
and
although
levinski
seized
this
fresh
opportunity
to
tell
the
audience
how
in
similar
circumstances
pride
to
his
lasting
remorse
had
kept
him
and
some
good
woman
a
third
one
apart
nevertheless
held
back
once
more
for
fear
lest
he
should
be
thought
to
be
marrying
her
for
her
money
the
curtain
comes
down
as
he
says
but
there
is
a
fourth
act
and
in
the
fourth
act
levinski
has
a
splendid
time
he
tells
the
audience
two
parables
one
about
a
dahlia
and
a
sheep
which
i
could
quite
follow
and
three
reminiscences
of
life
in
india
he
brings
together
finally
and
for
ever
these
hesitating
lovers
and
best
of
all
he
has
a
magnificent
of
his
own
with
a
pretty
widow
in
which
we
see
for
the
first
time
in
the
play
how
love
should
really
be
made
not
love
but
the
deep
emotion
felt
and
with
occasional
lapses
of
memory
explained
by
a
man
with
a
slight
embonpoint
who
has
knocked
about
the
world
a
bit
and
knows
life
levinski
i
need
hardly
say
was
at
his
best
in
this
act
i
met
prosper
vane
at
the
club
some
ten
days
before
the
first
night
and
asked
him
how
rehearsals
were
going
oh
all
right
he
said
but
it
a
rotten
play
i
got
such
a
dashed
silly
part
from
what
you
told
me
i
said
it
sounded
rather
good
it
so
dashed
unnatural
for
three
whole
acts
this
girl
and
i
are
in
love
with
each
other
and
we
know
we
in
love
with
each
other
and
yet
we
simply
fool
about
she
a
dashed
pretty
girl
too
my
boy
in
real
life
i
jolly
soon
my
dear
alfred
i
protested
you
not
going
to
fall
in
love
with
the
girl
you
have
to
fall
in
love
with
on
the
stage
i
thought
actors
never
did
that
they
do
sometimes
it
a
dashed
good
advertisement
anyway
it
a
silly
part
and
i
fed
up
with
it
yes
but
do
be
reasonable
if
got
engaged
at
once
to
what
would
happen
to
levinski
he
have
nothing
to
do
prosper
vane
grunted
as
he
seemed
disinclined
for
further
conversation
i
left
him
the
opening
night
came
and
the
usual
distinguished
and
fashionable
audience
including
myself
such
as
habitually
attends
first
nights
settled
down
to
enjoy
itself
two
acts
went
well
at
the
end
of
each
levinski
came
before
the
curtain
and
bowed
to
us
and
we
had
the
honour
of
clapping
him
loud
and
long
then
the
third
act
began
now
this
is
how
the
third
act
ends
sir
geoffrey
breaking
the
silence
dick
you
heard
what
he
said
let
this
silly
money
come
between
us
i
have
told
you
i
love
you
dear
wo
you
wo
you
speak
to
me
winifred
i
he
gets
up
and
walks
round
the
room
his
brow
knotted
his
right
fist
occasionally
striking
his
left
palm
finally
he
comes
to
a
stand
in
front
of
her
winifred
i
he
raises
his
arms
slowly
at
right
angles
to
his
body
and
lets
them
fall
heavily
down
again
i
ca
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
i
ca
he
stands
for
a
moment
with
bent
head
then
with
a
jerk
he
pulls
himself
together
his
hands
go
out
to
her
but
he
draws
them
back
as
if
frightened
to
touch
her
nobly
squares
his
shoulders
and
stands
looking
at
the
audience
with
his
chin
in
the
air
then
with
a
shrug
of
utter
despair
which
would
bring
tears
into
the
eyes
of
any
young
thing
in
the
pit
he
turns
and
with
bent
head
walks
slowly
that
is
how
the
third
act
ends
i
went
to
the
dress
rehearsal
and
so
i
know
how
the
accident
happened
i
do
not
know
i
suppose
prosper
was
nervous
i
am
sure
he
was
very
much
in
love
anyhow
this
is
how
on
that
famous
first
night
the
third
act
ended
sir
geoffrey
breaking
the
silence
dick
you
heard
what
he
said
let
this
silly
money
come
between
us
i
have
told
you
i
love
you
dear
wo
you
wo
you
speak
to
me
jumping
up
winifred
i
with
a
great
gulp
i
love
you
whereupon
he
picked
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
triumphantly
off
the
stage
and
after
a
little
natural
hesitation
the
curtain
came
down
behind
the
scenes
all
was
consternation
levinski
absolutely
furious
had
a
hasty
consultation
with
the
author
also
furious
in
the
course
of
which
they
both
saw
that
the
fourth
act
as
written
was
now
an
impossibility
poor
prosper
who
had
almost
immediately
recovered
his
sanity
tremblingly
suggested
that
levinski
should
announce
that
owing
to
the
sudden
illness
of
vane
the
fourth
act
could
not
be
given
levinski
was
kind
enough
to
consider
this
suggestion
not
entirely
stupid
his
own
idea
having
been
very
regretfully
to
leave
out
the
two
parables
and
three
reminiscences
from
india
and
concentrate
on
the
with
the
widow
yes
yes
he
said
your
plan
is
better
i
will
say
you
are
ill
it
is
true
you
are
mad
we
will
play
it
as
it
was
written
you
ca
said
the
author
gloomily
the
critics
wo
come
till
the
fourth
act
and
they
assume
that
the
third
act
ended
as
it
did
tonight
the
fourth
act
will
seem
all
nonsense
to
them
true
and
i
was
so
good
so
much
myself
in
that
act
he
turned
to
prosper
you
fool
or
there
another
way
began
the
author
we
might
and
then
a
gentleman
in
the
gallery
settled
it
from
the
front
of
the
curtain
there
was
nothing
in
the
programme
to
show
that
the
play
was
in
four
acts
the
time
is
the
and
the
scene
is
in
sir
geoffrey
throssell
was
all
it
said
and
the
gentleman
in
the
gallery
thinking
it
was
all
over
and
being
pleased
with
the
play
and
particularly
with
the
realism
of
the
last
moment
of
it
shouted
author
and
suddenly
everybody
else
cried
author
author
the
play
was
ended
i
said
that
this
was
the
story
of
a
comedy
which
nearly
became
a
tragedy
but
it
turned
out
to
be
no
tragedy
at
all
in
the
three
acts
to
which
prosper
vane
had
condemned
it
the
play
appealed
to
both
critics
and
public
for
the
fourth
act
as
he
recognised
so
clearly
was
unnecessary
and
would
have
spoilt
the
balance
of
it
entirely
best
of
all
the
shortening
of
the
play
demanded
that
some
entertainment
should
be
provided
in
front
of
it
and
this
enabled
levinski
to
introduce
to
the
public
professor
wollabollacolla
and
princess
collabollawolla
the
famous
exponents
of
the
that
fascinating
central
african
war
dance
which
was
soon
to
be
the
rage
of
society
but
though
as
a
result
the
takings
of
the
box
office
surpassed
all
previous
records
our
friend
prosper
vane
received
no
practical
acknowledgment
of
his
services
he
had
to
be
content
with
the
hand
and
heart
of
the
lady
who
played
and
the
fact
that
levinski
was
good
enough
to
attend
the
wedding
there
was
in
fact
a
photograph
in
all
the
papers
of
levinski
doing
it
xvi
the
doctor
may
i
look
at
my
watch
i
asked
my
partner
breaking
a
silence
which
had
lasted
from
the
beginning
of
the
waltz
oh
you
got
a
watch
she
drawled
how
exciting
i
was
going
to
show
it
to
you
i
said
but
i
always
think
it
looks
so
bad
for
a
man
to
remove
his
arm
from
a
lady
waist
in
order
to
look
at
his
watch
i
mean
without
some
sort
of
apology
or
explanation
as
though
he
were
wondering
if
he
could
possibly
stick
another
five
minutes
of
it
let
me
know
when
the
apology
is
beginning
said
miss
white
perhaps
after
all
her
name
was
white
but
anyhow
she
was
dressed
in
white
and
it
her
own
fault
if
wrong
impressions
arise
it
begins
at
once
i
got
to
catch
a
train
home
there
one
at
i
believe
if
i
started
now
i
could
just
miss
it
you
do
live
in
these
northern
heights
then
no
do
you
yes
i
looked
at
my
watch
again
i
should
love
to
discuss
with
you
the
relative
advantages
of
london
and
greater
london
i
said
the
flats
and
cats
of
one
and
the
big
gardens
of
the
other
but
just
at
the
moment
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is
whether
i
shall
like
the
walk
home
are
there
any
dangerous
passes
to
cross
it
a
nice
wet
night
for
a
walk
said
miss
white
reflectively
if
only
i
had
brought
my
bicycle
a
watch
a
bicycle
you
lucky
look
here
it
may
be
a
joke
to
you
but
i
do
fancy
myself
coming
down
the
mountains
at
night
the
last
train
goes
at
one
if
that
any
good
to
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
i
said
joyfully
then
i
need
walk
i
looked
at
my
watch
that
gives
us
five
minutes
more
i
could
almost
tell
you
all
about
myself
in
that
time
it
generally
takes
longer
than
that
said
miss
white
at
least
it
seems
to
she
sighed
and
added
my
partners
have
been
very
autobiographical
i
looked
at
her
severely
i
afraid
you
a
suffragette
i
said
as
soon
as
the
next
dance
began
i
hurried
off
to
find
my
hostess
i
had
just
caught
sight
of
her
when
our
dance
is
it
said
a
voice
i
turned
and
recognised
a
girl
in
blue
ah
i
said
coldly
cheerful
i
was
just
looking
for
you
come
along
we
broke
into
a
gay
and
happy
step
suggestive
of
twin
hearts
utterly
free
from
care
why
do
you
look
so
thoughtful
asked
the
girl
in
blue
after
ten
minutes
of
it
i
just
heard
some
good
news
i
said
oh
do
tell
me
i
do
know
if
it
would
really
interest
you
i
sure
it
would
well
several
miles
from
here
there
may
be
a
tram
if
one
can
find
it
which
goes
nobody
quite
knows
where
up
till
in
the
morning
probably
it
is
now
i
added
looking
at
my
watch
i
was
getting
quite
good
at
this
just
on
one
and
raining
hard
all
is
well
the
dance
over
i
searched
in
vain
for
my
hostess
every
minute
i
took
out
my
watch
and
seemed
to
feel
that
another
tram
was
just
starting
off
to
some
unknown
destination
at
last
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
deciding
to
write
a
letter
of
explanation
on
the
morrow
i
dashed
off
my
instructions
from
miss
white
with
regard
to
the
habitat
of
trams
thrown
in
by
her
at
the
last
moment
in
case
the
train
failed
me
were
vague
five
minutes
walk
convinced
me
that
i
had
completely
lost
any
good
that
they
might
ever
have
been
to
me
instinct
and
common
sense
were
the
only
guides
left
i
must
settle
down
to
some
heavy
detective
work
the
steady
rain
had
washed
out
any
footprints
that
might
have
been
of
assistance
and
i
was
unable
to
follow
up
the
slot
of
a
tram
conductor
of
which
i
had
discovered
traces
in
street
in
street
i
lay
with
my
ear
to
the
ground
and
listened
intently
for
i
seemed
to
hear
the
of
the
electric
car
but
nothing
came
of
it
and
in
street
i
made
a
new
resolution
i
decided
to
give
up
looking
for
trams
and
to
search
instead
for
london
the
london
that
i
knew
i
felt
pretty
certain
that
i
was
still
in
one
of
the
home
counties
and
i
did
not
seem
to
remember
having
crossed
the
thames
so
that
if
only
i
could
find
a
star
which
pointed
to
the
south
i
was
in
a
fair
way
to
get
home
i
set
out
to
look
for
a
star
with
the
natural
result
that
having
abandoned
all
hope
of
finding
a
man
i
immediately
ran
into
him
now
then
he
said
could
you
tell
me
the
way
to
i
tried
to
think
of
some
place
near
my
london
to
westminster
abbey
he
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
his
feeling
seemed
to
be
that
i
was
too
late
for
the
coronation
and
too
early
for
the
morning
service
or
or
anywhere
i
said
hurriedly
trams
for
instance
he
pointed
nervously
to
the
right
and
disappeared
imagine
my
joy
there
were
tramlines
and
better
still
a
tram
approaching
i
tumbled
in
gave
the
conductor
a
penny
and
got
a
workman
ticket
in
exchange
ten
minutes
later
we
reached
the
terminus
i
had
wondered
where
we
should
arrive
but
did
much
mind
so
long
as
i
was
again
within
reach
of
a
cab
however
as
soon
as
i
stepped
out
of
the
tram
i
knew
at
once
where
i
was
tell
me
i
said
to
the
conductor
do
you
now
go
back
again
in
ten
minutes
there
a
tram
from
here
every
when
is
the
last
there
no
last
backwards
and
forwards
all
night
i
should
have
liked
to
stop
and
sympathise
but
it
was
getting
late
i
walked
a
hundred
yards
up
the
hill
and
turned
to
the
right
as
i
entered
the
gates
i
could
hear
the
sound
of
music
is
this
our
dance
i
said
to
miss
white
who
was
taking
a
breather
at
the
hall
door
one
moment
i
added
and
i
got
out
of
my
coat
and
umbrella
is
it
i
thought
you
gone
oh
no
i
decided
to
stay
after
all
i
found
out
that
the
trams
go
all
night
we
walked
in
together
i
wo
be
more
autobiographical
than
i
can
help
i
said
but
i
must
say
it
hard
life
a
doctor
one
is
called
away
in
the
middle
of
a
dance
to
a
difficult
case
of
of
mumps
or
something
and
well
there
you
are
a
delightful
evening
spoilt
if
one
is
lucky
one
may
get
back
in
time
for
a
waltz
or
two
at
the
end
indeed
i
said
as
we
began
to
dance
at
one
time
i
quite
thought
i
was
going
to
get
back
here
at
all
xvii
the
financier
this
is
how
i
became
a
west
african
mining
magnate
with
a
stake
in
the
empire
during
february
i
grew
suddenly
tired
of
waiting
for
the
summer
to
begin
london
in
the
summer
is
a
pleasant
place
and
chiefly
so
because
you
can
keep
on
buying
evening
papers
to
read
the
cricket
news
in
february
life
has
no
such
excitements
to
offer
so
i
wrote
to
my
solicitor
about
it
i
want
you
i
wrote
to
buy
me
fifty
rubber
shares
so
that
i
can
watch
them
go
up
and
down
and
i
added
brokerage
to
show
that
i
knew
what
i
was
talking
about
he
replied
tersely
as
follows
do
be
a
fool
if
you
have
any
money
to
invest
i
can
get
you
a
safe
mortgage
at
five
per
cent
let
me
know
it
a
funny
thing
how
the
minds
of
solicitors
run
upon
mortgages
if
they
would
only
stop
to
think
for
a
moment
they
would
see
that
you
could
possibly
watch
a
safe
mortgage
go
up
and
down
i
left
my
solicitor
alone
and
consulted
henry
on
the
subject
in
the
intervals
between
golf
and
golf
henry
dabbles
in
finance
you
do
want
anything
i
gather
he
said
it
wonderful
how
they
talk
i
want
it
to
go
up
and
down
i
explained
patiently
and
i
indicated
the
required
movement
with
my
umbrella
what
about
a
little
flutter
in
oil
he
went
on
just
like
a
financier
in
a
novel
i
have
a
little
flutter
in
raspberry
jam
if
you
like
anything
as
long
as
i
can
rush
every
night
for
the
last
edition
of
the
evening
papers
and
say
now
and
then
heavens
i
ruined
then
you
better
try
a
gold
mine
said
henry
bitterly
in
the
voice
of
one
who
has
tried
take
your
choice
and
he
threw
the
paper
over
to
me
i
do
want
a
whole
mine
only
a
vein
or
two
yes
this
is
very
interesting
i
went
on
as
i
got
among
the
west
africans
the
scoring
seems
to
be
pretty
low
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
a
wet
wicket
reef
he
did
a
little
better
in
the
second
innings
boffin
river
they
followed
on
you
see
but
they
saved
the
innings
defeat
by
the
way
which
figure
do
i
really
keep
my
eye
on
when
i
want
to
watch
them
go
up
and
down
both
one
eye
on
each
and
do
talk
about
boffin
river
to
is
it
like
that
henry
i
am
sorry
i
suppose
it
too
late
now
to
offer
you
a
safe
mortgage
at
five
per
i
know
a
man
who
has
some
well
perhaps
you
right
on
the
next
day
i
became
a
magnate
the
jaguar
mine
was
the
one
i
fixed
upon
for
two
reasons
first
the
figure
immediately
after
it
was
which
struck
me
as
a
good
point
from
which
to
watch
it
go
up
and
down
secondly
i
met
a
man
at
lunch
who
knew
somebody
who
had
actually
seen
the
jaguar
mine
he
says
that
there
no
doubt
about
there
being
lots
there
lots
of
what
jaguars
or
gold
ah
he
did
say
perhaps
he
meant
jaguars
anyhow
it
was
an
even
chance
and
i
decided
to
risk
it
in
a
time
i
was
the
owner
of
what
we
call
in
the
city
a
block
of
jaguars
bought
from
one
herbert
bellingham
who
i
suppose
had
been
got
at
by
his
solicitor
and
compelled
to
return
to
something
safe
i
was
a
west
african
magnate
my
first
two
months
as
a
magnate
were
a
great
success
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
would
tear
open
the
financial
editions
of
the
evening
papers
to
find
one
day
that
jaguars
had
soared
like
a
rocket
to
the
next
that
they
had
dropped
like
a
stone
to
there
was
one
terrible
afternoon
when
for
some
reason
which
will
never
be
properly
explained
we
sank
to
i
think
the
european
situation
had
something
to
do
with
it
though
this
naturally
is
not
admitted
lord
rothschild
i
fancy
suddenly
threw
all
his
jaguars
on
the
market
he
sold
and
sold
and
sold
and
only
held
his
hand
when
in
desperation
the
tsar
granted
the
concession
for
his
new
southend
to
siberia
railway
something
like
that
but
he
never
recked
how
the
private
investor
would
suffer
and
there
was
i
sitting
at
home
and
sending
out
madly
for
all
the
papers
until
my
rooms
were
littered
with
copies
of
financial
feathered
and
next
day
we
were
up
to
and
i
breathed
again
but
i
had
other
pleasures
than
these
previously
i
had
regarded
the
city
with
awe
but
now
i
felt
a
glow
of
possession
come
over
me
whenever
i
approached
it
often
in
those
first
two
months
i
used
to
lean
against
the
mansion
house
in
a
familiar
sort
of
way
once
i
struck
a
match
against
the
royal
exchange
and
what
an
impression
of
financial
acumen
i
could
make
in
a
by
a
careless
reference
to
my
block
of
jaguars
even
those
who
misunderstood
me
and
thought
i
spoke
of
my
flock
of
jaguars
were
startled
indeed
life
was
very
good
just
then
but
lately
things
have
not
been
going
well
at
the
beginning
of
april
jaguars
settled
down
at
though
i
stood
for
hours
at
the
club
tape
my
hair
standing
up
on
end
and
my
eyeballs
starting
from
their
sockets
jaguars
still
came
through
steadily
at
to
give
them
a
chance
of
doing
something
i
left
them
alone
for
a
whole
week
with
what
agony
you
can
imagine
then
i
looked
again
a
whole
week
and
anything
might
have
happened
pauper
or
millionaire
no
still
worse
was
to
follow
editors
actually
took
to
leaving
out
jaguars
altogether
i
suppose
they
were
sick
of
putting
in
every
edition
but
how
ridiculous
it
made
my
idea
seem
of
watching
them
go
up
and
down
how
blank
life
became
again
and
now
what
i
dreaded
most
of
all
has
happened
i
have
received
a
progress
report
from
the
mine
it
gives
the
total
footage
for
the
month
special
reference
being
made
to
winzing
and
sinking
the
amount
of
tons
crushed
is
announced
there
is
serious
talk
of
ore
being
extracted
indeed
there
has
already
been
a
most
alarming
yield
in
fine
gold
in
short
it
can
no
longer
be
hushed
up
that
the
property
may
at
any
moment
be
placed
on
a
basis
probably
i
shall
be
getting
a
safe
five
per
dash
it
all
as
i
said
to
my
solicitor
this
morning
i
might
just
as
well
have
bought
a
rotten
mortgage

the
things
that
matter
ronald
surveying
the
world
from
his
taxi
that
pleasant
corner
of
the
world
james
park
gave
a
sigh
of
happiness
the
blue
sky
the
lawn
of
daffodils
the
mist
of
green
upon
the
trees
were
but
a
promise
of
the
better
things
which
the
country
held
for
him
beautiful
as
he
thought
the
daffodils
he
found
for
the
moment
an
even
greater
beauty
in
the
gladstone
bags
at
his
feet
his
eyes
wandered
from
one
to
the
other
and
his
heart
sang
to
him
i
going
away
i
going
away
i
going
away
the
train
was
advertised
to
go
at
and
at
ronald
joined
the
easter
holiday
crowd
upon
the
platform
a
porter
put
down
his
luggage
and
was
then
swallowed
up
in
a
sea
of
perambulators
and
flustered
parents
ronald
never
saw
him
again
at
amidst
some
applause
the
train
came
in
ronald
seized
a
lost
porter
just
put
these
in
for
me
he
said
a
first
smoker
all
this
lot
yours
sir
the
three
bags
not
the
said
ronald
it
had
been
a
beautiful
day
before
but
when
a
family
of
sixteen
which
joined
ronald
in
his
carriage
was
ruthlessly
hauled
out
by
the
guard
the
sun
seemed
to
shine
with
a
warmth
more
caressing
than
ever
even
when
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
and
the
children
who
had
been
mislaid
emerged
from
their
and
were
bundled
in
anywhere
by
the
married
porters
ronald
still
remained
splendidly
alone
and
the
sky
took
on
yet
a
deeper
shade
of
blue
he
lay
back
in
his
corner
thinking
for
a
time
his
mind
was
occupied
with
the
thoughts
common
to
most
of
us
when
we
go
away
thoughts
of
all
the
things
we
have
forgotten
to
pack
i
do
think
you
could
fairly
have
called
ronald
about
clothes
he
recognised
that
it
was
the
inner
virtues
which
counted
that
a
exterior
was
nothing
without
some
graces
of
mind
or
body
but
at
the
same
time
he
did
feel
strongly
that
if
you
are
going
to
stay
at
a
house
where
you
have
never
visited
before
and
if
you
are
particularly
anxious
to
make
a
good
impression
it
a
pity
that
an
accident
of
packing
should
force
you
to
appear
at
dinner
in
green
knickerbockers
and
somebody
velvet
ronald
could
help
feeling
that
he
had
forgotten
something
it
the
spare
sponge
it
was
the
extra
it
was
the
second
pair
of
bedroom
slippers
just
for
a
moment
the
sun
went
behind
a
cloud
as
he
wondered
if
he
had
included
the
reserve
but
no
he
distinctly
remembered
packing
that
the
reason
for
his
vague
feeling
of
unrest
was
this
he
had
been
interrupted
while
getting
ready
that
afternoon
and
as
he
left
whatever
he
had
been
doing
in
order
to
speak
to
his
housekeeper
he
had
said
to
himself
if
you
not
careful
you
forget
about
that
when
you
come
back
and
now
he
could
not
remember
what
it
was
he
had
been
doing
nor
whether
he
in
the
end
forgotten
to
go
on
with
it
was
he
selecting
his
ties
or
brushing
his
hair
or
the
country
was
appearing
field
by
field
the
train
rushed
through
cuttings
gay
with
spring
flowers
blue
was
the
sky
between
the
baby
clouds
but
it
all
missed
ronald
what
he
have
forgotten
he
went
over
the
days
that
were
coming
he
went
through
all
the
changes
of
toilet
that
the
hours
might
bring
he
had
packed
this
and
this
and
this
and
this
he
was
all
right
for
the
evening
supposing
they
played
golf
he
was
all
right
for
golf
he
might
want
to
ride
he
would
be
able
to
ride
it
was
too
early
for
lawn
tennis
but
well
anyhow
he
had
put
in
flannels
as
he
considered
all
the
possible
clothes
that
he
might
want
it
really
seemed
that
he
had
provided
for
everything
if
he
liked
he
could
go
to
church
on
friday
morning
hunt
otters
from
twelve
to
one
on
saturday
toboggan
or
dig
for
badgers
on
monday
he
had
the
different
suits
necessary
for
those
who
attend
a
meeting
who
play
chess
or
who
go
out
after
moths
with
a
pot
of
treacle
and
even
in
the
last
resort
he
could
go
to
bed
yes
he
was
all
right
he
had
packed
moreover
his
hair
was
brushed
and
he
had
no
smut
upon
his
face
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
lowered
the
window
and
his
soul
drank
in
the
beautiful
afternoon
we
are
going
away
we
are
going
away
we
are
going
away
sang
the
train
at
the
prettiest
of
wayside
stations
the
train
stopped
and
ronald
got
out
there
were
horses
to
meet
him
better
than
a
car
thought
ronald
on
an
afternoon
like
this
the
luggage
was
collected
nothing
left
out
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
was
seized
with
an
insane
desire
to
tell
the
coachman
so
and
then
they
drove
off
through
the
fresh
green
hedgerows
ronald
trying
hard
not
to
cheer
his
host
was
at
the
door
as
they
arrived
ronald
as
happy
as
a
child
jumped
out
and
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
told
him
what
a
heavenly
day
it
was
receiving
with
smiles
of
pleasure
the
news
in
return
that
it
was
almost
like
summer
you
just
in
time
for
tea
really
we
might
have
it
in
the
garden
by
jove
we
might
said
ronald
beaming
however
they
had
it
in
the
hall
with
the
doors
wide
open
ronald
sitting
lazily
with
his
legs
stretched
out
and
a
cup
of
tea
in
his
hands
and
feeling
already
on
the
friendliest
terms
with
everybody
wondered
again
at
the
difference
which
the
weather
could
make
to
happiness
you
know
he
said
to
the
girl
on
his
right
on
a
day
like
this
seems
to
matter
and
then
suddenly
he
knew
that
he
was
wrong
for
he
had
discovered
what
it
was
which
he
had
told
himself
not
to
forget
what
it
was
which
he
had
indeed
forgotten
and
suddenly
the
birds
stopped
singing
and
there
was
a
bitter
chill
in
the
air
and
the
sun
went
violently
out
he
was
wearing
only
of
spats
three
stories
xix
the
making
of
a
christmas
story
yuletide
london
at
yuletide
a
mantle
of
white
lay
upon
the
embankment
where
our
story
opens
gleaming
and
glistening
as
it
caught
the
rays
of
the
cold
december
sun
an
embroidery
of
white
fringed
the
trees
and
under
a
canopy
of
white
the
proud
palaces
of
savoy
and
cecil
reared
their
silent
heads
the
mighty
river
in
front
was
motionless
for
the
finger
of
death
had
laid
its
icy
hand
upon
it
above
the
hard
blue
sky
stretching
to
eternity
below
the
white
purity
of
innocence
london
in
the
grip
of
winter
i
like
this
this
is
going
to
be
good
a
cold
day
was
it
not
all
at
once
the
quiet
of
the
morning
was
disturbed
in
the
distance
a
bell
rang
out
sending
a
joyous
pæan
to
the
heavens
another
took
up
the
word
and
then
another
and
another
westminster
caught
the
message
from
bartholomew
the
son
of
thunder
and
flung
it
to
giles
without
who
gave
it
gently
to
andrew
by
the
wardrobe
suddenly
the
air
was
filled
with
bells
all
chanting
together
of
peace
and
happiness
mirth
and
jollity
a
frenzy
of
bells
the
duke
father
of
four
fine
children
waking
in
his
highland
castle
heard
and
smiled
as
he
thought
of
his
little
ones
the
merchant
prince
turning
over
in
his
magnificent
residence
heard
and
turned
again
to
sleep
with
love
for
all
mankind
in
his
heart
the
pauper
in
his
workhouse
up
betimes
heard
and
chuckled
at
the
prospect
of
his
christmas
dinner
and
on
the
embankment
robert
hardrow
with
a
cynical
smile
on
his
lips
listened
to
the
splendid
irony
of
it
really
are
getting
to
the
story
now
are
we
not
was
all
local
colour
i
want
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
it
was
yes
quite
so
this
is
certainly
a
christmas
story
i
think
i
shall
like
robert
do
you
know
it
was
christmas
day
so
much
at
least
was
clear
to
him
with
that
same
cynical
smile
on
his
lips
he
pulled
his
shivering
rags
about
him
and
half
unconsciously
felt
at
the
growth
of
beard
about
his
chin
nobody
would
recognise
him
now
his
friends
as
he
had
thought
them
would
pass
by
without
a
glance
for
the
poor
outcast
near
them
the
women
that
he
had
known
would
draw
their
skirts
away
from
him
in
horror
even
lady
alice
lady
alice
the
cause
of
it
all
his
thoughts
flew
back
to
that
last
scene
but
hours
ago
when
they
had
parted
for
ever
as
he
had
entered
the
hall
he
had
half
wondered
to
himself
if
there
could
be
anybody
in
the
world
that
day
happier
than
himself
tall
a
of
the
tariff
reform
league
and
engaged
to
the
sweetest
girl
in
england
he
had
been
the
envy
of
all
little
did
he
think
that
that
very
night
he
was
to
receive
his
what
mattered
it
now
how
or
why
they
had
quarrelled
a
few
hasty
words
a
bitter
taunt
tears
and
then
the
end
a
last
cry
from
her
go
and
let
me
never
see
your
face
again
a
last
sneer
from
him
i
will
go
but
first
give
me
back
the
presents
i
have
promised
you
then
a
slammed
door
and
silence
what
use
without
her
guidance
to
try
to
keep
straight
any
more
bereft
of
her
love
robert
had
sunk
steadily
gambling
drink
morphia
billiards
and
cigars
he
had
taken
to
them
all
until
now
in
the
wretched
figure
of
the
outcast
on
the
embankment
you
would
never
have
recognised
the
once
spruce
figure
of
handsome
hardrow
all
seems
to
have
happened
rather
rapidly
does
it
not
hours
ago
he
had
forget
that
this
is
handsome
hardrow
how
absurd
it
sounded
now
he
had
let
his
beard
grow
his
clothes
were
in
rags
a
scar
over
one
eye
testified
yes
of
course
i
quite
admit
that
a
man
might
go
to
the
bad
in
hours
but
would
his
beard
grow
as
here
you
heard
of
a
man
going
grey
with
trouble
in
a
single
night
have
you
certainly
it
the
same
idea
as
quite
so
quite
was
i
scar
over
one
eye
was
just
testifying
i
suppose
he
had
two
eyes
in
the
ordinary
way
testified
to
a
drunken
frolic
of
an
hour
or
two
ago
never
before
thought
the
policeman
as
he
passed
upon
his
beat
had
such
a
pitiful
figure
cowered
upon
the
embankment
and
prayed
for
the
night
to
cover
him
the
he
was
er
the
tell
the
truth
i
am
rather
stuck
for
the
is
the
trouble
do
quite
know
what
to
do
with
robert
for
ten
hours
or
he
go
somewhere
by
a
local
line
is
not
a
humorous
story
the
point
is
that
i
want
him
to
be
outside
a
certain
house
some
twenty
miles
from
town
at
eight
that
i
were
robert
i
should
certainly
start
at
i
have
as
he
sat
there
his
thoughts
flew
over
the
bridge
of
years
and
he
was
wafted
on
the
wings
of
memory
to
other
and
happier
yuletides
that
christmas
when
he
had
received
his
first
bicycle
that
christmas
abroad
the
merry
at
the
place
of
his
cambridge
friend
yuletide
at
the
towers
where
he
had
first
met
alice
ah
ten
hours
passed
rapidly
thus
put
stars
to
denote
the
flight
of
it
will
give
the
reader
time
for
a
robert
got
up
and
shook
himself
moment
this
is
a
christmas
story
when
are
you
coming
to
the
robin
really
ca
be
bothered
about
robins
just
now
i
assure
you
all
the
best
christmas
stories
begin
like
this
nowadays
we
may
get
to
a
robin
later
i
can
not
must
my
readers
expect
a
robin
and
they
shall
have
it
and
a
and
a
turkey
and
a
and
a
yes
but
wait
we
shall
come
to
little
elsie
soon
and
then
perhaps
it
will
be
all
elsie
good
robert
got
up
and
shook
himself
then
he
shivered
miserably
as
the
cold
wind
cut
through
him
like
a
knife
for
a
moment
he
stood
motionless
gazing
over
the
stone
parapet
into
the
dark
river
beyond
and
as
he
gazed
a
thought
came
into
his
mind
why
not
end
it
all
here
and
now
he
had
nothing
to
live
for
one
swift
plunge
and
forget
the
river
was
it
i
was
just
going
to
say
but
no
even
in
this
fate
was
against
him
river
was
frozen
over
he
turned
away
with
a
curse
what
happened
afterwards
robert
never
quite
understood
almost
unconsciously
he
must
have
crossed
one
of
the
numerous
bridges
which
span
the
river
and
join
north
london
to
south
once
on
the
other
side
he
seems
to
have
set
his
face
steadily
before
him
and
to
have
dragged
his
weary
limbs
on
and
on
regardless
of
time
and
place
he
walked
like
one
in
a
dream
his
mind
drugged
by
the
dull
narcotic
of
physical
pain
suddenly
he
realised
that
he
had
left
london
behind
him
and
was
in
the
more
open
spaces
of
the
country
the
houses
were
more
scattered
the
recurring
villa
of
the
clerk
had
given
place
to
the
isolated
mansion
of
the
stockbroker
each
residence
stood
in
its
own
splendid
grounds
surrounded
by
fine
old
forest
trees
and
approached
by
a
long
carriage
sweep
electric
so
the
whole
forming
a
magnificent
estate
for
a
retired
gentleman
never
mind
robert
stood
at
the
entrance
to
one
of
these
houses
and
the
iron
entered
into
his
soul
how
different
was
this
man
position
from
his
own
what
right
had
this
man
a
perfect
stranger
to
be
happy
and
contented
in
the
heart
of
his
family
while
he
robert
stood
a
homeless
wanderer
alone
in
the
cold
almost
unconsciously
he
wandered
down
the
drive
hardly
realising
what
he
was
doing
until
he
was
brought
up
by
the
gay
lights
of
the
windows
still
without
thinking
he
stooped
down
and
peered
into
the
brilliantly
lit
room
above
him
within
all
was
jollity
beautiful
women
moved
to
and
fro
and
the
happy
laughter
of
children
came
to
him
elsie
he
heard
some
one
call
and
a
childish
treble
responded
for
the
am
very
sorry
i
have
just
remembered
something
rather
sad
the
fact
is
that
two
days
before
elsie
had
forgotten
to
feed
the
robin
and
in
consequence
it
had
died
before
this
story
is
really
very
awkward
i
have
already
arranged
with
an
artist
to
do
some
pictures
and
i
remember
i
particularly
ordered
a
robin
and
a
wassail
what
about
the
wassail
always
had
her
a
terrible
thought
had
come
into
robert
head
it
was
nearly
twelve
the
was
retiring
to
bed
he
heard
the
wafted
through
the
open
window
the
lights
went
out
to
reappear
upstairs
presently
they
too
went
out
and
robert
was
alone
with
the
darkened
house
the
temptation
was
too
much
for
a
conscience
already
sodden
with
billiards
golf
and
cigars
he
flung
a
leg
over
the
sill
and
drew
himself
gently
into
the
room
at
least
he
would
have
one
good
meal
he
too
would
have
his
christmas
dinner
before
the
end
came
he
switched
the
light
on
and
turned
eagerly
to
the
table
his
eyes
ravenously
scanned
the
contents
turkey
all
was
there
as
in
the
days
of
his
youth
is
better
i
ordered
a
turkey
i
remember
what
about
the
mistletoe
and
holly

sigh

elsie
robert

thanked

again
that

their
work
and
a
pleasant
warmth

over

surprise

robert

find
something
to
give
her
now
the
remains
of
the
turkey
a
pair
of
his
old
hat
all
these
came
hastily
into
his
mind
and
were
dismissed
he
had
nothing
of
value
on
him
all
had
been
pawned
long
ago
stay
the
gold
locket
studded
with
diamonds
and
rubies
which
contained
alice
photograph
the
one
memento
of
her
that
he
had
kept
even
when
the
pangs
of
starvation
were
upon
him
he
brought
it
from
its
next
his
heart
a
little
something
to

your
neck

alice

elsie

a
voice

father
kwithmath
thithter
exactly
do
you
work
the
lisping
do
you
mean
do
children
of
elsie
tender
years
lisp
sometimes
but
just
now
she
said
kwistmas
quite
am
glad
you
noticed
that
that
was
an
effect
which
i
intended
to
produce
lisping
is
brought
about
by
placing
the
tongue
upon
the
hard
surface
of
the
palate
and
in
cases
where
the
subject
is
unduly
excited
or
influenced
by
emotion
the
lisp
becomes
more
pronounced
in
this
case
i
send
her
away
cried
robert
without
raising
his
head
the
door
opened
and
closed
again
well
said
alice
calmly
and
who
are
you
you
may
have
lied
to
this
poor
child
but
you
can
not
deceive
me
you
are
father
christmas
the
miserable
man
raised
his
shamefaced
head
and
looked
haggardly
at
her
alice
he
muttered
do
you
remember
me
she
gazed
at
him
earnestly
robert
but
how
changed
since
we
parted
alice
much
has
happened
yet
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
i
saw
you
yes
do
interrupt
now
to
me
it
has
seemed
years
but
what
are
you
doing
here
said
alice
rather
what
are
doing
here
answered
robert
think
alice
question
was
the
more
reasonable
i
live
here
robert
gave
a
sudden
cry
your
house
then
i
have
broken
into
your
house
alice
send
me
away
put
me
in
prison
do
what
you
will
to
me
i
can
never
hold
up
my
head
again
lady
alice
looked
gently
at
the
wretched
figure
in
front
of
her
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
she
said
because
i
wanted
to
say
that
it
was
fault
alice
can
you
forgive
me
forgive
you
if
you
knew
what
my
life
has
been
since
i
left
you
if
you
knew
into
what
paths
of
wickedness
i
have
sunk
how
only
this
evening
unnerved
by
excess
i
have
deliberately
broken
into
this
house
house
in
order
to
obtain
food
already
i
have
eaten
more
than
half
a
turkey
and
the
best
part
of
a
plum
pudding
i
with
a
gesture
of
infinite
compassion
she
stopped
him
then
let
us
forgive
each
other
she
said
with
a
smile
a
new
year
is
beginning
robert
he
took
her
in
his
arms
listen
he
said
in
the
distance
the
bells
began
to
ring
in
the
new
year
a
message
of
hope
to
all
weary
travellers
on
life
highway
it
was
new
year
day
thought
christmas
day
had
started
on
the
embankment
this
would
be
boxing
sorry
but
it
must
end
like
that
i
must
have
my
all
very
well
i
have
a
good
deal
to
explain
as
it
is
some
of
your
story
does
fit
the
pictures
at
all
and
it
is
too
late
now
to
get
new
ones
am
afraid
i
can
not
work
to
i
know
the
artist
said
the
same
thing
well
i
must
manage
somehow
i
suppose
rotten
weather
for
august
it
xx
a
fairy
tale
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
who
had
three
sons
the
two
eldest
were
lazy
young
men
but
the
third
son
whose
name
was
charming
was
a
delightful
youth
who
was
loved
by
everybody
outside
his
family
who
knew
him
whenever
he
rode
through
the
town
the
people
used
to
stop
whatever
work
they
were
engaged
upon
and
wave
their
caps
and
cry
hurrah
for
prince
charming
and
even
after
he
had
passed
they
would
continue
to
stop
work
in
case
he
might
be
coming
back
the
same
way
when
they
would
wave
their
caps
and
cry
hurrah
for
prince
charming
again
it
was
wonderful
how
fond
of
him
they
were
but
alas
his
father
the
king
was
not
so
fond
he
preferred
his
eldest
son
which
was
funny
of
him
because
he
must
have
known
that
only
the
third
and
youngest
son
is
ever
any
good
in
a
family
indeed
the
king
himself
had
been
a
third
son
so
he
had
really
no
excuse
for
ignorance
on
the
point
i
am
afraid
the
truth
was
that
he
was
jealous
of
charming
because
the
latter
was
so
popular
outside
his
family
now
there
lived
in
the
palace
an
old
woman
called
countess
caramel
who
had
been
governess
to
charming
when
he
was
young
when
the
queen
lay
dying
the
countess
had
promised
her
that
she
would
look
after
her
youngest
boy
for
her
and
charming
had
often
confided
in
caramel
since
one
morning
when
his
family
had
been
particularly
rude
to
him
at
breakfast
charming
said
to
her
countess
i
have
made
up
my
mind
and
i
am
going
into
the
world
to
seek
my
fortune
i
have
been
waiting
for
this
said
the
countess
here
is
a
magic
ring
wear
it
always
on
your
little
finger
and
whenever
you
want
help
turn
it
round
once
and
help
will
come
charming
thanked
her
and
put
the
ring
on
his
finger
then
he
turned
it
round
once
just
to
make
sure
that
it
worked
immediately
the
oddest
little
dwarf
appeared
in
front
of
him
speak
and
i
will
obey
said
the
dwarf
now
charming
did
want
anything
at
all
just
then
so
after
thinking
for
a
moment
he
said
go
away
the
dwarf
a
little
surprised
disappeared
this
is
splendid
thought
charming
and
he
started
on
his
travels
with
a
light
heart
the
sun
was
at
its
highest
as
he
came
to
a
thick
wood
and
in
its
shade
he
lay
down
to
rest
he
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
weeping
rising
hastily
to
his
feet
he
peered
through
the
trees
and
there
fifty
yards
away
from
him
by
the
side
of
a
stream
sat
the
most
beautiful
damsel
he
had
ever
seen
wringing
her
hands
and
sobbing
bitterly
prince
charming
grieving
at
the
sight
of
beauty
in
such
distress
coughed
and
came
nearer
princess
he
said
tenderly
for
he
knew
she
must
be
a
princess
you
are
in
trouble
how
can
i
help
you
fair
sir
she
answered
i
had
thought
to
be
alone
but
since
you
are
here
you
can
help
me
if
you
will
i
have
a
a
brother
but
charming
did
not
want
to
talk
about
brothers
he
sat
down
on
a
fallen
log
beside
her
and
looked
at
her
entranced
i
think
you
are
the
most
lovely
lady
in
all
the
world
he
said
am
i
said
the
princess
whose
name
by
the
way
was
beauty
she
looked
away
from
him
and
there
was
silence
between
them
charming
a
little
at
a
loss
fidgeted
nervously
with
his
ring
and
began
to
speak
again
ever
since
i
have
known
you
you
are
in
need
of
help
said
the
dwarf
appearing
suddenly
certainly
not
said
charming
angrily
not
in
the
least
i
can
manage
this
quite
well
by
myself
speak
and
i
will
obey
then
go
away
said
charming
and
the
dwarf
who
was
beginning
to
lose
his
grip
of
things
again
disappeared
the
princess
having
politely
pretended
to
be
looking
for
something
while
this
was
going
on
turned
to
him
again
come
with
me
she
said
and
i
will
show
you
how
you
can
help
me
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
down
a
narrow
glade
to
a
little
clearing
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
then
she
made
him
sit
down
beside
her
on
the
grass
and
there
she
told
him
her
tale
there
is
a
giant
called
blunderbus
she
said
who
lives
in
a
great
castle
ten
miles
from
here
he
is
a
terrible
magician
and
years
ago
because
i
would
not
marry
him
he
turned
my
my
brother
into
a
i
know
how
to
tell
you
into
a
a
tortoise
she
put
her
hands
to
her
face
and
sobbed
again
why
a
tortoise
said
charming
knowing
that
sympathy
was
useless
but
feeling
that
he
ought
to
say
i
do
know
he
just
thought
of
it
it
it
is
a
very
nice
thing
to
be
and
why
should
he
turn
your
into
it
i
mean
if
he
had
turned
into
a
tortoise
of
course
he
went
on
hurriedly
i
very
glad
he
did
thank
you
said
beauty
but
i
do
understand
why
he
knew
he
could
hurt
me
more
by
making
my
brother
a
tortoise
than
by
making
me
one
she
explained
and
looked
at
him
anxiously
this
was
a
new
idea
to
charming
who
had
two
brothers
of
his
own
and
he
looked
at
her
in
some
surprise
oh
what
does
it
matter
he
did
it
she
cried
as
he
was
about
to
speak
why
do
giants
do
things
do
know
princess
said
charming
remorsefully
and
kissed
her
hand
tell
me
how
i
can
help
you
my
brother
said
beauty
was
to
have
met
me
here
he
is
late
again
she
sighed
and
added
he
used
to
be
punctual
but
how
can
i
help
him
asked
charming
it
is
like
this
the
only
way
in
which
the
enchantment
can
be
taken
off
him
is
for
some
one
to
kill
the
giant
but
if
once
the
enchantment
has
stayed
on
for
seven
years
then
it
stays
on
for
ever
here
she
looked
down
and
burst
into
tears
the
seven
years
she
sobbed
are
over
at
sundown
this
afternoon
i
see
said
charming
thoughtfully
here
is
my
brother
cried
beauty
an
enormous
tortoise
came
slowly
into
view
beauty
rushed
up
to
him
and
having
explained
the
situation
rapidly
made
the
necessary
introduction
charmed
said
the
tortoise
you
ca
miss
the
castle
it
the
only
one
near
here
and
blunderbus
is
sure
to
be
at
home
i
need
not
tell
you
how
grateful
i
shall
be
if
you
kill
him
though
i
must
say
he
added
it
puzzles
me
to
think
how
you
are
going
to
do
it
i
have
a
friend
who
will
help
me
said
charming
fingering
his
ring
well
i
only
hope
you
be
luckier
than
the
others
the
others
cried
charming
in
surprise
yes
did
she
tell
you
about
the
others
who
tried
i
forgot
to
said
beauty
frowning
at
him
ah
well
perhaps
in
that
case
we
better
not
go
into
it
now
said
the
tortoise
but
before
you
start
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
privately
for
a
moment
he
took
charming
on
one
side
and
whispered
i
say
do
know
anything
about
tortoises
very
little
said
charming
in
fact
then
you
do
happen
to
know
what
they
eat
i
afraid
i
do
dash
it
why
does
know
the
others
all
made
the
most
ridiculous
suggestions
steak
and
kidney
puddings
shrimp
sandwiches
and
buttered
toast
dear
me
the
nights
we
had
after
the
shrimp
sandwiches
and
the
fool
swore
he
had
kept
tortoises
all
his
life
if
i
may
say
so
said
charming
i
should
have
thought
that
would
have
known
best
the
same
silly
idea
they
all
have
said
the
tortoise
testily
when
blunderbus
put
this
enchantment
on
me
do
you
suppose
he
got
a
blackboard
and
a
piece
of
chalk
and
gave
me
a
lecture
on
the
diet
and
habits
of
the
common
tortoise
before
showing
me
out
of
the
front
gate
no
he
simply
turned
me
into
the
form
of
a
tortoise
and
left
my
mind
and
soul
as
it
was
before
i
got
the
anatomy
of
a
tortoise
i
got
the
very
delicate
inside
of
a
tortoise
but
i
do
like
one
stupid
else
i
should
mind
being
one
i
never
thought
of
that
no
one
does
except
me
and
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
he
paused
and
added
confidently
we
trying
rum
omelettes
just
now
somehow
i
think
tortoises
like
them
however
we
shall
see
i
suppose
you
never
heard
anything
definite
against
them
you
need
bother
about
that
said
charming
briskly
by
you
will
be
a
man
again
and
he
patted
him
encouragingly
on
the
shell
and
returned
to
take
an
affectionate
farewell
of
the
princess
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
charming
turned
the
ring
round
his
finger
and
the
dwarf
appeared
before
him
the
same
as
usual
said
the
dwarf
preparing
to
vanish
at
the
word
he
was
just
beginning
to
get
into
the
swing
of
it
no
no
said
charming
hastily
i
really
want
you
this
time
he
thought
for
a
moment
i
want
he
said
at
last
a
sword
one
that
will
kill
giants
instantly
a
gleaming
sword
was
at
his
feet
he
picked
it
up
and
examined
it
is
this
really
a
magic
sword
it
has
but
to
inflict
one
scratch
said
the
dwarf
and
the
result
is
death
charming
who
had
been
feeling
the
blade
took
his
thumb
away
hastily
then
i
shall
want
a
cloak
of
darkness
he
said
behold
here
it
is
beneath
this
cloak
the
wearer
is
invisible
to
the
eyes
of
his
enemies
one
thing
more
said
charming
a
pair
of
boots
thank
you
that
is
all
directly
the
dwarf
was
gone
charming
kicked
off
his
shoes
and
stepped
into
the
magic
boots
then
he
seized
the
sword
and
the
cloak
and
darted
off
on
his
lady
behest
he
had
barely
gone
a
hundred
paces
before
a
sudden
idea
came
to
him
and
he
pulled
himself
up
short
let
me
see
he
reflected
the
castle
was
ten
miles
away
these
are
boots
so
that
i
have
come
about
two
thousand
miles
i
shall
have
to
go
back
he
took
some
hasty
steps
back
and
found
himself
in
the
wood
from
which
he
had
started
well
said
princess
beauty
have
you
killed
him
no
stammered
charming
not
exactly
killed
him
i
was
just
just
practising
something
the
fact
is
he
added
confidently
i
got
a
pair
of
new
boots
on
and
he
saw
the
look
of
cold
surprise
in
her
face
and
went
on
quickly
i
swear
princess
that
i
will
not
return
to
you
again
without
his
head
he
took
a
quick
step
in
the
direction
of
the
castle
and
found
himself
soaring
over
it
turned
eleven
miles
off
and
stepped
back
a
pace
overshot
it
again
and
arrived
at
the
very
feet
of
the
princess
his
head
said
beauty
eagerly
i
i
must
have
dropped
it
said
charming
hastily
pretending
to
feel
for
it
i
just
go
and
he
stepped
off
in
confusion
eleven
miles
the
wrong
side
of
the
castle
charming
sat
down
to
think
it
out
it
was
but
two
hours
to
sundown
without
his
magic
boots
he
would
get
to
the
castle
too
late
of
course
what
he
really
wanted
to
do
was
to
erect
an
isosceles
triangle
on
a
base
of
eleven
miles
having
two
sides
of
miles
each
but
this
was
before
euclid
time
however
by
taking
one
step
to
the
north
and
another
to
the
southwest
he
found
himself
close
enough
a
short
but
painful
walk
with
his
boots
in
his
hand
brought
him
to
his
destination
he
had
a
hesitation
about
making
a
first
call
at
the
castle
in
his
stockinged
feet
but
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
in
matters
one
can
not
bother
about
little
points
of
etiquette
and
that
anyhow
the
giant
would
not
be
able
to
see
them
then
donning
the
magic
cloak
and
with
the
magic
sword
in
his
hand
he
entered
the
castle
gates
for
an
instant
his
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
but
the
thought
of
the
princess
gave
him
new
courage
the
giant
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
his
great
spiked
club
between
his
knees
at
charming
entry
he
turned
round
gave
a
start
of
surprise
bent
forward
eagerly
a
moment
and
then
leant
back
chuckling
like
most
men
he
was
naturally
and
had
a
simple
humour
but
he
could
be
stubborn
when
he
liked
the
original
affair
of
the
tortoise
seems
to
have
shown
him
both
at
his
best
and
at
his
worst
why
do
you
walk
like
that
he
said
pleasantly
to
charming
the
baby
is
not
asleep
charming
stopped
short
you
see
me
he
cried
furiously
of
course
i
do
really
you
must
expect
to
come
into
a
house
without
anything
on
your
feet
and
not
be
a
little
noticeable
even
in
a
crowd
i
should
have
picked
you
out
that
miserable
dwarf
said
charming
savagely
swore
solemnly
to
me
that
beneath
this
cloak
i
was
invisible
to
the
eyes
of
my
enemies
but
then
we
are
enemies
smiled
the
giant
sweetly
i
like
you
immensely
there
something
about
you
directly
you
came
in
i
think
it
must
be
love
at
first
sight
so
how
he
tricked
me
oh
no
it
was
really
like
that
the
fact
is
you
are
invisible
that
cloak
only
you
excuse
my
pointing
it
out
there
are
such
funny
bits
of
you
that
are
beneath
the
cloak
you
no
idea
how
odd
you
look
just
a
head
and
two
legs
and
a
couple
of
arms
waists
he
murmured
to
himself
are
not
being
worn
this
year
but
charming
had
had
enough
of
talk
griping
his
sword
firmly
he
threw
aside
his
useless
cloak
dashed
forward
and
with
a
beautiful
lunge
pricked
his
enemy
in
the
ankle
victory
he
cried
waving
his
magic
sword
above
his
head
thus
is
beauty
brother
delivered
the
giant
stared
at
him
for
a
full
minute
then
he
put
his
hands
to
his
sides
and
fell
back
shaking
in
his
chair
her
brother
he
roared
well
of
all
the
her
he
rolled
on
the
floor
in
a
paroxysm
of
mirth
her
brother
oh
you
you
kill
me
her
her
her
her
the
world
suddenly
seemed
very
cold
to
charming
he
turned
the
ring
on
his
finger
well
said
the
dwarf
i
want
said
charming
curtly
to
be
back
at
home
riding
through
the
streets
on
my
cream
palfrey
amidst
the
cheers
of
the
populace
at
once
an
hour
later
princess
beauty
and
prince
udo
who
was
not
her
brother
gazed
into
each
other
eyes
and
beauty
last
illusion
went
you
altered
she
said
slowly
yes
i
not
really
much
like
a
tortoise
said
udo
humorously
i
meant
since
seven
years
ago
you
much
stouter
than
i
thought
time
has
exactly
stood
still
with
you
you
know
beauty
yet
you
saw
me
every
day
and
went
on
loving
me
well
er
he
shuffled
his
feet
and
looked
away
you
well
you
see
of
course
i
wanted
to
get
back
you
see
and
as
long
as
you
i
mean
if
we
if
you
thought
we
were
in
love
with
each
other
then
of
course
you
were
ready
to
help
me
and
so
you
quite
old
and
bald
i
ca
think
why
i
did
notice
it
before
well
you
would
when
i
was
a
tortoise
said
udo
pleasantly
as
tortoises
go
i
was
really
quite
a
youngster
besides
anyhow
one
never
notices
baldness
in
a
tortoise
i
think
said
beauty
weighing
her
words
carefully
i
think
gone
off
a
good
deal
in
looks
the
last
day
or
two
charming
was
home
in
time
for
dinner
and
the
next
morning
he
was
more
popular
than
ever
outside
his
family
as
he
rode
through
the
streets
of
the
city
but
blunderbus
lay
dead
in
his
castle
you
and
i
know
that
he
was
killed
by
the
magic
sword
yet
somehow
a
strange
legend
grew
up
around
his
death
and
ever
afterwards
in
that
country
when
one
man
told
his
neighbour
a
more
than
ordinarily
humorous
anecdote
the
latter
would
cry
in
between
the
gusts
of
merriment
do
you
make
me
die
of
laughter
and
then
he
would
pull
himself
together
and
add
with
a
sigh
like

primrose
farm
stood
slumbering
in
the
sunlight
of
an
early
summer
morn
save
for
the
gentle
breeze
which
played
in
the
tops
of
the
two
tall
elms
all
nature
seemed
at
rest
chanticleer
had
ceased
his
song
the
pigs
were
asleep
in
the
barn
the
cow
lay
thinking
a
deep
peace
brooded
over
the
rural
scene
the
peace
of
centuries
terrible
to
think
that
in
a
few
short
hours
but
perhaps
it
wo
the
truth
is
i
have
not
quite
decided
whether
to
have
the
murder
in
this
story
or
in
no
the
severed
thumb
we
shall
see
as
her
alarum
clock
a
birthday
present
struck
five
gwendolen
french
sprang
out
of
bed
and
plunged
her
face
into
the
clump
of
nettles
which
grew
outside
her
lattice
window
for
some
minutes
she
stood
there
breathing
in
the
incense
of
the
day
then
dressing
quickly
she
went
down
into
the
great
kitchen
to
prepare
breakfast
for
her
father
and
the
pigs
as
she
went
about
her
simple
duties
she
sang
softly
to
herself
a
song
of
love
and
knightly
deeds
little
did
she
think
that
a
lover
even
at
that
moment
stood
outside
her
door
sighed
gwendolen
and
she
poured
the
into
a
bowl
and
took
it
up
to
her
father
room
for
eighteen
years
gwendolen
french
had
been
the
daughter
of
john
french
of
primrose
farm
endowed
by
nature
with
a
beauty
that
is
seldom
seen
outside
this
sort
of
story
she
was
yet
as
modest
and
as
good
a
girl
as
was
to
be
found
in
the
county
many
a
fine
lady
would
have
given
all
her
parisian
diamonds
for
the
complexion
which
bloomed
on
the
fair
face
of
gwendolen
but
the
gifts
of
nature
are
not
to
be
bought
and
sold
there
was
a
sudden
knock
at
the
door
come
in
cried
gwendolen
in
surprise
unless
it
was
the
cow
it
was
an
entirely
unexpected
visitor
a
tall
and
handsome
young
man
entered
striking
his
head
violently
against
a
beam
as
he
stepped
into
the
kitchen
good
morning
he
said
repressing
the
remark
which
came
more
readily
to
his
lips
pray
forgive
this
intrusion
the
fact
is
i
have
lost
my
way
and
i
wondered
whether
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
inform
me
as
to
my
whereabouts
gwendolen
curtsied
this
is
primrose
farm
sir
she
said
i
fear
he
replied
with
a
smile
it
has
been
my
misfortune
never
to
have
heard
so
charming
a
name
before
i
am
lord
beltravers
of
beltravers
castle
beltravers
having
returned
last
night
from
india
i
came
out
for
an
early
stroll
this
morning
and
i
fear
that
i
have
wandered
out
of
my
direction
why
cried
gwendolen
your
lordship
is
miles
from
beltravers
castle
how
tired
and
hungry
you
must
be
she
removed
a
lettuce
from
the
dusted
it
and
offered
it
to
him
that
is
to
say
the
chair
let
me
get
you
some
milk
she
added
picking
up
a
pail
she
went
out
to
inspect
the
cow
gad
said
lord
beltravers
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
he
paced
rapidly
up
and
down
the
tiled
kitchen
deuce
take
it
he
added
recklessly
she
a
lovely
girl
the
beltraverses
were
noted
in
two
continents
for
their
hard
swearing
here
you
are
sir
said
gwendolen
returning
with
the
precious
liquid
lord
beltravers
seized
the
pail
and
drained
it
at
a
draught
heavens
but
that
was
good
he
said
what
was
it
milk
said
gwendolen
milk
i
must
remember
and
now
may
i
trespass
on
your
hospitality
still
further
by
trespassing
on
your
assistance
so
far
as
to
solicit
your
help
in
putting
me
far
enough
on
my
path
to
discover
my
way
back
to
beltravers
castle
when
he
was
alone
he
said
that
sentence
again
to
himself
and
wondered
what
had
happened
to
it
i
will
show
you
she
said
simply
they
passed
out
into
the
sunlit
orchard
in
an
a
thrush

singing
the
gooseberries
were
overripe

flowering
everywhere

sardine
on
a

as
each

entered
lord
beltravers
scanned

a
snarl
of
disappointment

never

came
at

attired
in
a
frock
which
had
obviously
been
created
in

she
looked
the
picture
of
girlish
innocence
as
she
stood
for

moment
hesitating
in

her
eyes
brightened
as

affianced
the

was
at
its
height
gwendolen
who
had
been
in

supper
eight
times
placed
her
hand
timidly
on
the
arm
of
lord
beltravers
who
had
just
begged
a
polka
of
her

out
she
said

gravely

to
you
offering
her
his
arm
he
led
her
down
the
great
terrace
which
ran
along
the
back
of
the
house
how
wonderful
to
have
your
ancestors
always
round

like
this
cooed
gwendolen
as
she
gazed
with
reverence
at
the
two
statues
which
fronted
them

said
lord
beltravers
shortly
and
samson
he
led
her
down
the
steps
and
into
the
ornamental
garden
and
there
they
sat
down

may
call
you
by
that
sweet
name
i
have
brought
you
here
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
offer
to
you
perhaps
it
would
have
been
more
in
accordance
with
etiquette
had
i
approached
your
mother
first
mother

dead
said
the
girl
simply
i
am
sorry
said
lord
beltravers
bending
his
head
in
courtly
sympathy
in
that
case
i
should
have
asked
your
father
to
hear
my
suit

replied
he
could
have
heard
it
tut
tut
said
lord
beltravers
impatiently

to
you
miss
french
an
offer

hope
gwendolen
put

too
much
for
her
fresh
young
innocence

begged

slipped
a
ring
off
his
finger
and
fitted
it
affectionately
on

of
hers

he
said
gravely
it

over

height
in
a
dream

happiness
gwendolen
revolved
with
closed
eyes
round
lord
beltravers
of
beltravers
castle
beltravers
suddenly
above
the
music
rose
a
voice
commanding
threatening
stop
cried
the
lady
beltravers
as
if
by
magic
the
band
ceased
and
all
the
dancers
were
still
there

an
intruder

in

voice
a
milkmaid
a

instant

said
with
the
utmost
dignity
not
a
common
milkmaid
but
the
future
lady
beltravers
an
indescribable
thrill
of
emotion
ran
through
the
crowded
lord
hobble
stud
fell
out
and
lady
susan
golightly
hurried
across
the
room
and
fainted
in
the
arms
of
sir
james
batt
what
cried
the
lady
beltravers
my
son
the
last
of
the
beltraverses
the
beltraverses
who
came
over
with
julius
wernher
i
should
say
cæsar
marry
a
milkmaid
no
mother
he
is
marrying
what
any
man
would
be
proud
to
marry
a
simple
english
girl
there
was
a
cheer
instantly
suppressed
from
a
socialist
in
the
band
for
just
a
moment
words
failed
the
lady
beltravers
then
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
waved
her
guests
away
the
ball
is
over
she
said
slowly
leave
me
my
son
and
i
must
be
alone
one
by
one
with
murmured
thanks
for
a
delightful
evening
the
guests
trooped
out
soon
mother
and
son
were
alone
lord
beltravers
gazing
out
of
the
window
saw
the
laboriously
dragging
his
across
the
park
chapter
v
wedded
and
now
dear
readers
i
am
in
a
difficulty
how
shall
the
story
go
on
the
editor
of
seaside
asks
quite
frankly
for
a
murder
his
idea
was
that
the
lady
beltravers
should
be
found
dead
in
the
park
next
morning
and
that
gwendolen
should
be
arrested
this
seems
to
me
both
crude
and
vulgar
besides
i
want
a
murder
for
no
xcix
of
the
series
the
severed
thumb
no
i
think
i
know
a
better
way
out
old
john
french
sat
beneath
a
spreading
and
waited
early
that
morning
a
mysterious
note
had
been
brought
to
him
asking
for
an
interview
on
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
this
was
the
i
have
come
said
a
voice
behind
him
to
ask
you
to
beg
your
daughter
have
cried
the
lady
beltravers
ask
i
have
come
shouted
her
ladyship
to
john
french
wheeled
round
in
amazement
with
a
cry
the
lady
beltravers
shrank
back
eustace
she
gasped
eustace
earl
of
turbot
eliza
what
are
you
doing
here
i
came
to
see
john
french
what
he
asked
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
she
repeated
her
remark
loudly
several
times
i
am
john
french
he
said
at
last
when
you
refused
me
and
married
beltravers
i
suddenly
felt
tired
of
society
and
i
changed
my
name
and
settled
down
here
as
a
simple
farmer
my
daughter
helps
me
on
the
farm
then
your
daughter
is
lady
gwendolen
hake
a
beautiful
double
wedding
was
solemnised
at
beltravers
in
october
the
earl
of
turbot
leading
eliza
lady
beltravers
to
the
altar
while
lord
beltravers
was
joined
in
matrimony
to
the
beautiful
lady
gwendolen
hake
there
were
many
presents
on
both
sides
which
partook
equally
of
the
beautiful
and
the
costly
lady
gwendolen
beltravers
is
now
the
most
popular
hostess
in
the
county
but
to
her
husband
she
always
seems
the
simple
english
milkmaid
that
he
first
thought
her
ah
xxii
the
first
of
spring
there
may
be
gardeners
who
can
appear
to
be
busy
all
the
year
round
doing
even
in
the
winter
their
little
bit
under
glass
but
for
myself
i
wait
reverently
until
the
of
march
is
here
then
spring
having
officially
arrived
i
step
out
on
to
the
lawn
and
summon
my
james
i
say
the
winter
is
over
at
last
what
have
we
got
in
that
big
bed
in
the
middle
there
well
sir
he
says
we
do
seem
to
have
anything
do
we
like
perhaps
there
something
down
below
that
has
pushed
through
yet
maybe
there
is
i
wish
you
knew
more
about
it
i
say
angrily
i
want
to
bed
out
the
macaroni
there
have
we
got
a
spare
bed
with
nothing
going
on
underneath
i
do
know
sir
shall
i
dig
up
and
have
a
look
yes
perhaps
you
better
i
say
between
ourselves
james
is
a
man
of
no
initiative
he
has
to
be
told
everything
however
mention
of
him
brings
me
to
my
first
rule
for
young
gardeners
sow
spring
onions
and
new
potatoes
in
the
same
i
did
this
by
accident
last
year
the
fact
is
when
the
onions
were
given
to
me
i
quite
thought
they
were
young
daffodils
a
mistake
any
one
might
make
of
course
i
do
generally
keep
daffodils
and
potatoes
together
but
james
swore
that
the
hard
round
things
were
tulip
bulbs
it
is
perfectly
useless
to
pay
your
a
week
if
he
does
know
the
difference
between
potatoes
and
tulip
bulbs
well
anyhow
there
they
were
in
the
herbaceous
border
together
and
they
grew
up
side
by
side
the
onions
getting
stronger
every
day
and
the
potatoes
more
sensitive
at
last
just
when
they
were
ripe
for
picking
i
found
that
the
young
onions
had
actually
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
of
the
potatoes
to
such
an
extent
that
the
latter
were
too
damp
for
baking
or
roasting
and
had
to
be
mashed
now
as
everybody
knows
mashed
potatoes
are
beastly
the
rhubarb
border
gives
me
more
trouble
than
all
the
rest
of
the
garden
i
started
it
a
year
ago
with
the
idea
of
keeping
the
sun
off
the
young
carnations
it
acted
excellently
and
the
complexion
of
the
flowers
improved
tenfold
then
one
day
i
discovered
james
busily
engaged
in
pulling
up
the
rhubarb
what
are
you
doing
i
cried
do
you
want
the
young
carnations
to
go
all
brown
i
was
going
to
send
some
in
to
the
cook
he
grumbled
to
the
cook
what
do
you
mean
rhubarb
is
a
vegetable
no
it
a
fruit
i
looked
at
james
anxiously
he
had
a
large
hat
on
and
the
sun
have
got
to
the
back
of
his
neck
my
dear
james
i
said
i
do
pay
you
a
week
for
being
funny
perhaps
we
had
better
make
it
two
shillings
in
future
however
he
persisted
in
his
theory
that
in
the
spring
people
stewed
rhubarb
in
tarts
and
ate
it
well
i
have
discovered
since
that
this
is
actually
so
people
really
do
grow
it
in
their
gardens
not
with
the
idea
of
keeping
the
sun
off
the
young
carnations
but
under
the
impression
that
it
is
a
fruit
consequently
i
have
found
it
necessary
to
adopt
a
firm
line
with
my
friends
rhubarb
on
arriving
at
any
house
for
a
visit
the
first
thing
i
say
to
my
host
is
may
i
see
your
rhubarb
bed
i
have
heard
such
a
lot
about
it
by
all
means
he
says
feeling
rather
flattered
and
leads
the
way
into
the
garden
what
a
glorious
sunset
i
say
pointing
to
the
west
is
it
he
says
turning
round
and
then
i
surreptitiously
drop
a
pint
of
on
the
bed
next
morning
i
get
up
early
and
paint
the
roots
of
the
survivors
with
iodine
once
my
host
who
for
some
reason
had
got
up
early
too
discovered
me
what
are
you
doing
he
asked
just
painting
the
roots
with
iodine
i
said
to
prevent
the
rhubarb
falling
out
to
prevent
what
to
keep
the
green
fly
away
i
corrected
myself
it
the
new
french
intensive
system
but
he
was
suspicious
and
i
had
to
leave
two
or
three
stalks
untreated
we
had
those
for
lunch
that
day
there
was
only
one
thing
for
a
man
to
do
i
obtained
a
large
plateful
of
the
weed
and
emptied
the
sugar
basin
and
cream
jug
over
it
then
i
took
a
mouthful
of
the
pastry
gave
a
little
start
and
said
oh
is
this
rhubarb
sorry
i
did
know
whereupon
i
pushed
my
plate
away
and
started
on
the
cheese
asparagus
asparagus
wants
watching
very
carefully
it
requires
to
be
tended
like
a
child
frequently
i
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
wonder
if
james
has
remembered
to
put
the
bottle
in
the
asparagus
bed
whenever
i
get
up
to
look
i
find
that
he
has
forgotten
he
tells
me
that
he
is
beginning
to
think
that
the
things
which
are
coming
up
now
are
not
asparagus
after
all
but
young
hyacinths
this
is
very
annoying
i
am
inclined
to
fancy
that
james
is
not
the
man
he
was
for
the
sake
of
his
reputation
in
the
past
i
hope
he
is
not
potting
out
i
have
spent
a
very
busy
morning
potting
out
the
nasturtiums
we
have
them
in
three
qualities
mild
medium
and
full
nasturtiums
are
extremely
peppery
flowers
and
take
offence
so
quickly
that
the
utmost
tact
is
required
to
pot
them
successfully
in
a
general
way
all
the
red
or
reddish
flowers
should
be
potted
as
soon
as
they
are
old
enough
to
stand
it
but
it
is
considered
bad
form
among
horticulturists
to
pot
the
white
james
has
been
sowing
the
roses
i
wanted
all
the
pink
ones
in
one
bed
and
all
the
yellow
ones
in
another
and
so
on
but
james
says
you
never
can
tell
for
certain
what
colour
a
flower
is
going
to
be
until
it
comes
up
of
course
any
fool
could
tell
then
you
should
go
by
the
picture
on
the
outside
of
the
packet
i
said
they
very
misleading
said
james
anyhow
they
must
be
all
brothers
in
the
same
packet
you
might
have
a
brother
with
red
hair
says
james
i
had
thought
of
that
grafting
grafting
is
when
you
try
short
approaches
over
the
pergola
in
somebody
else
garden
and
break
the
best
tulip
you
mend
it
with
a
stamp
and
hope
that
nobody
will
notice
at
any
rate
not
until
you
have
gone
away
on
the
monday
of
course
in
your
own
garden
you
never
want
to
graft
i
hope
at
some
future
time
to
be
allowed
even
encouraged
to
refer
to
such
things
as
the
most
artistic
way
to
frame
cucumbers
how
to
stop
tomatoes
blushing
the
homoeopathic
method
of
putting
them
next
to
the
french
beans
is
now
discredited
and
spring
fashions
in
fox
gloves
but
for
the
moment
i
have
said
enough
the
great
thing
to
remember
in
gardening
is
that
flowers
fruits
and
vegetables
alike
can
only
be
cultivated
with
sympathy
special
attention
should
be
given
to
backward
and
delicate
plants
they
should
be
encouraged
to
make
the
most
of
themselves
never
forget
that
flowers
like
ourselves
are
particular
about
the
company
they
keep
if
a
hyacinth
droops
in
the
celery
bed
put
it
among
the
pansies
but
above
all
mind
a
firm
hand
with
the
rhubarb
xxiii
the
coming
of
the
crocus
it
a
bootiful
day
again
sir
said
my
gardener
james
looking
in
at
the
study
window
bootiful
james
bootiful
i
said
as
i
went
on
with
my
work
you
might
almost
say
as
spring
was
here
at
last
like
cross
your
fingers
quickly
james
and
touch
wood
look
here
i
be
out
in
a
minute
and
give
you
some
orders
but
i
very
busy
just
now
thought
you
like
to
know
there
eleven
crocuses
in
the
front
garden
then
send
them
away
we
got
nothing
for
them
crocuses
shouted
james
i
jumped
up
eagerly
and
climbed
through
the
window
my
dear
man
i
said
shaking
him
warmly
by
the
hand
this
is
indeed
a
day
crocuses
and
in
the
front
gar
on
the
south
lawn
let
us
go
and
gaze
at
them
there
they
were
eleven
of
them
six
golden
ones
four
white
and
a
little
mauve
chap
this
is
a
triumph
for
you
james
it
wonderful
has
anything
like
this
ever
happened
to
you
before
there
be
some
more
up
i
wo
say
as
not
those
really
are
growing
are
they
you
have
been
pushing
them
in
from
the
top
they
were
actually
born
on
the
estate
there
be
a
fine
one
in
the
back
bed
soon
said
james
proudly
in
the
back
my
dear
james
in
the
spare
bed
on
the
terrace
i
suppose
you
mean
and
what
have
we
done
in
the
dutch
ornamental
garden
if
i
has
to
look
after
ornamental
gardens
and
south
aspics
and
all
i
ought
to
have
my
salary
raised
said
james
still
harping
on
his
one
grievance
by
all
means
raise
some
celery
i
said
coldly
take
the
spade
and
raise
some
for
lunch
i
shall
be
only
too
delighted
this
here
is
the
season
for
celery
as
you
know
well
this
the
season
for
crocuses
as
any
one
can
see
if
they
use
their
eyes
james
you
right
forgive
me
it
is
no
day
for
quarrelling
it
was
no
day
for
working
either
the
sun
shone
upon
the
green
of
the
deer
park
the
sky
was
blue
above
the
rose
garden
in
the
tapioca
grove
a
thrush
was
singing
i
walked
up
and
down
my
estate
and
drank
in
the
good
fresh
air
james
i
called
to
my
what
is
it
now
he
grumbled
are
there
no
daffodils
to
take
the
winds
of
march
with
beauty
there
these
eleven
croc
but
there
should
be
daffodils
too
is
not
this
march
it
may
be
march
but
is
the
time
for
daffodils
not
on
three
shillings
a
week
do
you
only
get
three
shillings
a
week
i
thought
it
was
three
shillings
an
hour
likely
an
hour
ah
well
i
knew
it
was
three
shillings
do
you
know
james
in
the
scilly
islands
there
are
fields
and
fields
and
fields
of
nodding
daffodils
out
now
lor
said
james
did
you
say
or
i
asked
suspiciously
to
think
of
that
now
said
james
cautiously
he
wandered
off
to
the
tapioca
grove
leant
against
it
in
thought
for
a
moment
and
came
back
to
me
what
wrong
with
this
little
bit
of
garden
this
here
park
he
began
is
the
soil
it
no
soil
for
daffodils
now
what
daffodils
like
is
clay
then
for
heaven
sake
get
them
some
clay
spare
no
expense
get
them
anything
they
fancy
it
too
alloovial
that
what
the
matter
too
alloovial
now
crocuses
like
a
bit
of
alloovial
that
where
you
have
it
the
matter
with
james
is
that
he
has
enough
work
to
do
the
rest
of
the
staff
is
so
busily
employed
that
it
is
hardly
ever
visible
william
for
instance
is
occupied
entirely
with
what
i
might
call
the
poultry
it
is
his
duty
in
fact
to
see
that
there
are
always
enough
ants
eggs
for
the
all
these
prize
leghorns
you
hear
about
are
the
merest
novices
compared
with
william
then
john
looks
after
the
staggery
henry
works
the
coloured
fountain
and
peter
paints
the
peacocks
tails
this
keeps
them
all
busy
but
james
is
for
ever
hanging
about
almost
seems
as
if
they
were
yooman
he
said
as
we
stood
and
listened
to
the
rooks
oh
are
you
there
james
it
a
beautiful
day
who
said
that
first
i
believe
you
did
them
there
rooks
always
make
a
place
seem
so
rooks
and
crocuses
i
say
and
you
do
want
anything
more
yes
well
if
the
rooks
want
to
build
in
the
raspberry
canes
this
year
let
them
james
do
be
inhospitable
course
some
do
like
to
see
primroses
i
do
say
but
primroses
i
knew
there
was
something
where
are
they
it
too
early
for
them
said
james
hastily
you
wo
get
primroses
now
before
april
do
say
as
if
it
were
my
fault
why
did
you
plant
them
earlier
i
do
believe
you
know
any
of
the
tricks
of
your
profession
james
you
never
seem
to
graft
anything
or
prune
anything
and
i
sure
you
do
know
how
to
cut
a
slip
james
why
do
you
prune
more
prune
now
i
should
like
to
watch
you
where
your
you
possibly
do
it
with
a
rake
james
spends
most
of
his
day
with
a
rake
sometimes
leaning
on
it
sometimes
working
with
it
the
beds
are
always
beautifully
kept
only
the
most
hardy
annual
would
dare
to
poke
his
head
up
and
spoil
the
smooth
appearance
of
the
soil
for
those
who
like
circles
and
rectangles
of
unrelieved
brown
james
is
undoubtedly
the
man
as
i
stood
in
the
sun
i
had
a
brilliant
idea
james
i
said
we
cut
the
croquet
lawn
this
afternoon
you
ca
play
croquet
it
not
warm
enough
i
do
pay
you
to
argue
but
to
obey
at
the
same
time
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
i
never
said
i
was
going
to
play
croquet
i
said
that
we
meaning
you
would
cut
the
lawn
what
the
good
of
that
why
to
encourage
the
wonderful
day
of
course
where
is
your
gratitude
man
do
you
want
to
do
something
to
help
how
can
we
let
a
day
like
this
go
past
without
some
word
of
welcome
out
with
the
mower
and
let
us
hail
the
passing
of
winter
james
looked
at
me
in
disgust
gratitude
he
said
indignantly
to
heaven
and
there
my
eleven
crocuses
in
the
front
all
together
like
anything
on
three
bob
a
week
xxiv
the
landscape
gardener
really
i
know
nothing
about
flowers
by
a
bit
of
luck
james
my
gardener
whom
i
pay
a
week
for
combing
the
beds
knows
nothing
about
them
either
so
my
ignorance
remains
undiscovered
but
in
other
people
gardens
i
have
to
make
something
of
an
effort
to
keep
up
appearances
without
flattering
myself
i
may
say
that
i
have
acquired
a
certain
manner
i
give
the
impression
of
the
garden
lover
or
the
man
with
shares
in
a
or
or
something
for
instance
at
creek
cottage
atherley
will
say
to
me
that
an
pointing
to
something
which
i
had
noticed
behind
a
rake
i
am
not
a
bit
surprised
i
say
calmly
and
a
next
to
it
i
suspected
it
i
confess
in
a
hoarse
whisper
towards
flowers
whose
names
i
know
i
adopt
a
different
tone
are
you
surprised
to
see
daffodils
out
so
early
says
atherley
with
pride
there
are
lots
out
in
london
i
mention
casually
in
the
shops
so
there
are
grapes
says
miss
atherley
i
was
not
talking
about
grapes
i
reply
stiffly
however
at
creek
cottage
just
now
i
can
afford
to
be
natural
for
it
is
not
gardening
which
comes
under
discussion
these
days
but
and
any
one
can
be
an
authority
on
that
the
atherleys
fired
by
my
tales
of
sandringham
chatsworth
arundel
and
other
places
where
i
am
constantly
spending
the
are
their
field
in
future
it
will
not
be
called
the
garden
but
the
grounds
i
was
privileged
to
be
shown
over
the
grounds
on
my
last
visit
to
creek
cottage
here
said
atherley
we
are
having
a
plantation
it
will
keep
the
wind
off
and
we
shall
often
sit
here
in
the
early
days
of
summer
that
a
weeping
ash
in
the
middle
there
another
one
over
there
they
be
lovely
you
know
what
that
i
asked
pointing
to
a
bit
of
black
stick
on
the
left
which
even
more
than
the
other
trees
gave
the
impression
of
having
been
left
there
by
the
gardener
while
he
went
for
his
lunch
that
a
weeping
willow
this
is
rather
a
tearful
corner
of
the
grounds
apologised
miss
atherley
we
show
you
something
brighter
directly
look
there
that
the
oak
in
which
king
charles
lay
hid
at
least
it
will
be
when
it
grown
a
bit
let
go
on
to
the
shrubbery
said
atherley
we
are
having
a
new
grass
path
from
here
to
the
shrubbery
it
going
to
be
called
walk
miss
atherley
has
a
small
brother
called
henry
also
there
were
eight
kings
of
england
called
henry
many
a
time
and
oft
one
of
those
nine
henrys
has
paced
up
and
down
this
grassy
walk
his
head
bent
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
while
behind
his
furrowed
brow
who
shall
say
what
were
hatching
is
it
the
thought
of
wolsey
which
makes
him
frown
or
is
he
wondering
where
he
left
his
catapult
ah
who
can
tell
us
let
us
leave
a
veil
of
mystery
over
it
for
the
sake
of
the
next
visitor
the
shrubbery
said
atherley
proudly
waving
her
hand
at
a
couple
of
laurel
bushes
and
a
i
forgotten
its
name
now
but
it
is
one
of
the
few
shrubs
i
really
know
and
if
you
a
gentleman
said
miss
atherley
and
want
to
get
asked
here
again
you
always
it
the
shrubbery
really
i
do
see
what
else
you
could
call
it
i
said
wishing
to
be
asked
down
again
the
patch
true
i
said
i
mean
nonsense
i
was
rather
late
for
breakfast
next
morning
a
pity
on
such
a
lovely
spring
day
i
so
sorry
i
began
but
i
was
looking
at
the
shrubbery
from
my
window
and
i
quite
forgot
the
time
good
said
miss
atherley
i
must
thank
you
for
putting
me
in
such
a
perfect
room
for
it
i
went
on
warming
to
my
subject
one
can
actually
see
the
shrubs
er
shrubbing
the
plantation
too
seems
a
little
thicker
to
me
than
yesterday
i
expect
it
is
in
fact
the
tennis
lawn
i
looked
round
anxiously
i
had
a
sudden
fear
that
it
might
be
the
new
it
still
is
the
tennis
lawn
i
asked
yes
why
what
about
it
i
was
only
going
to
say
the
tennis
lawn
had
quite
a
lot
of
shadows
on
it
oh
there
no
doubt
that
the
plantation
is
really
asserting
itself
eleven
found
me
strolling
in
the
grounds
with
miss
atherley
you
know
i
said
as
we
paced
henry
walk
together
the
one
thing
the
plantation
wants
is
for
a
bird
to
nest
in
it
that
is
the
hallmark
of
a
plantation
it
mother
birthday
would
it
be
a
lovely
surprise
for
her
it
would
indeed
unfortunately
this
is
a
matter
in
which
you
require
the
of
a
feathered
friend
could
you
try
to
persuade
a
bird
to
build
a
nest
in
the
weeping
ash
just
for
this
once
you
asking
me
a
very
difficult
thing
i
said
doubtfully
anything
else
i
would
do
cheerfully
for
you
but
to
dictate
to
a
bird
on
such
a
very
domestic
affair
no
i
afraid
i
must
refuse
it
need
only
just
begin
to
build
one
pleaded
miss
atherley
because
mother
going
up
town
by
your
train
as
soon
as
she
out
of
the
house
the
bird
can
go
back
to
anywhere
else
it
likes
better
i
will
put
that
to
any
bird
i
see
i
said
but
i
am
doubtful
oh
well
sighed
miss
atherley
never
mind
what
do
you
think
cried
atherley
as
she
came
in
to
breakfast
next
day
there
a
bird
been
nesting
in
the
plantation
miss
atherley
looked
at
me
in
undisguised
admiration
i
looked
quite
surprised
i
know
i
did
well
well
i
said
you
must
come
out
afterwards
and
see
the
nest
and
tell
me
what
bird
it
is
there
are
three
eggs
in
it
i
am
afraid
i
do
know
much
about
these
things
i
glad
i
said
thankfully
i
mean
i
shall
be
glad
to
we
went
out
eagerly
after
breakfast
on
about
the
only
tree
in
the
plantation
with
a
fork
to
it
a
nest
balanced
precariously
it
had
in
it
three
eggs
splotched
with
it
appeared
to
be
a
nest
with
another
egg
or
two
to
come
it
been
very
quick
about
it
said
miss
atherley
of
our
feathered
bipeds
i
said
frowning
at
her
the
blackbird
is
notoriously
the
most
hasty
is
it
lovely
said
atherley
she
was
still
talking
about
it
as
she
climbed
into
the
trap
which
was
to
take
us
to
the
station
one
moment
i
said
i
forgotten
something
i
dashed
into
the
house
and
out
by
a
side
door
and
then
sprinted
for
the
plantation
i
took
the
nest
from
the
weeping
and
overweighted
ash
and
put
it
carefully
back
in
the
hedge
by
the
then
i
returned
more
leisurely
to
the
house
if
ever
you
want
a
job
of
thoroughly
well
done
you
can
always
rely
upon
me
xxv
you
play
tennis
said
my
hostess
absently
that
right
let
me
introduce
you
to
miss
er
um
oh
we
met
before
smiled
miss
i
forgotten
the
name
again
now
thank
you
i
said
gratefully
i
thought
it
was
extremely
nice
of
her
to
remember
me
probably
i
had
spilt
lemonade
over
her
at
a
dance
and
in
some
way
the
incident
had
fixed
itself
in
her
mind
we
do
these
little
things
you
know
and
think
nothing
of
them
at
the
moment
but
all
the
time
smooth
said
a
voice
i
looked
up
and
found
that
a
pair
of
opponents
had
mysteriously
appeared
and
that
my
partner
was
leading
the
way
on
to
the
court
i
take
the
side
if
you
do
mind
she
announced
oh
and
what
about
apologising
she
went
on
shall
we
do
it
after
every
stroke
or
at
the
end
of
each
game
or
when
we
say
or
never
i
get
so
tired
of
saying
oh
but
we
sha
want
to
apologise
i
sure
we
going
to
get
on
beautifully
together
i
suppose
you
played
a
lot
this
summer
no
not
at
all
yet
but
i
feeling
rather
strong
and
i
got
a
new
racquet
one
way
and
another
i
expect
to
play
a
very
powerful
game
our
male
opponent
served
he
had
what
i
should
call
a
nasty
swift
service
the
first
ball
rose
very
suddenly
and
took
my
partner
on
the
side
of
the
head
sorry
she
apologised
it
all
right
i
said
magnanimously
i
returned
the
next
into
the
net
the
third
clean
bowled
my
partner
and
off
the
last
i
was
caught
in
the
slips
will
you
serve
said
miss
i
wish
i
could
remember
her
surname
her
christian
name
was
hope
or
charity
or
something
like
that
i
know
when
i
heard
it
i
thought
it
was
just
as
well
if
i
might
call
her
miss
hope
for
this
once
thank
you
will
you
serve
said
miss
hope
in
the
court
i
use
the
american
service
which
means
that
i
never
know
till
the
last
moment
which
side
of
the
racquet
is
going
to
hit
the
ball
on
this
occasion
it
was
a
dead
heat
that
is
to
say
i
got
it
in
between
with
the
wood
and
the
ball
sailed
away
over
beds
and
beds
of
the
most
beautiful
flowers
oh
is
the
american
service
said
miss
hope
much
interested
south
american
i
explained
down
in
peru
they
never
use
anything
else
in
the
court
i
employ
the
ordinary
hampstead
smash
into
the
bottom
of
the
net
after
four
hampstead
smashes
and
four
peruvian
teasers
i
felt
that
another
explanation
was
called
for
i
got
a
new
racquet
i
never
used
before
i
said
my
old
one
is
being
pressed
it
went
to
the
shop
yesterday
to
have
the
creases
taken
out
do
you
find
that
with
a
new
racquet
you
er
exactly
in
the
third
game
we
not
only
got
the
ball
over
the
net
but
kept
it
between
the
white
lines
on
several
occasions
though
not
so
often
as
our
opponents
and
in
the
fourth
game
miss
hope
served
gentle
lobs
while
i
at
her
request
stood
close
up
to
the
net
and
defended
myself
with
my
racquet
i
warded
off
the
first
two
shots
amidst
applause
and
dodged
the
next
three
but
the
last
one
was
too
quick
for
me
and
won
the
cocoanut
with
some
ease
love
it
all
right
thanks
i
said
to
my
partner
it
really
does
hurt
a
bit
now
then
let
buck
up
and
play
a
simply
dashing
game
miss
hope
excelled
herself
in
that
fifth
game
but
i
was
still
unable
to
find
a
length
to
be
more
accurate
i
was
unable
to
find
a
shortness
my
long
game
was
admirably
strong
and
lofty
are
you
musical
said
my
partner
at
the
end
of
it
she
had
been
very
talkative
all
through
come
come
i
said
impatiently
you
do
want
a
song
at
this
very
moment
surely
you
can
wait
till
the
end
of
the
set
oh
i
was
only
just
wondering
i
quite
see
your
point
you
feel
that
nature
always
compensates
us
in
some
way
and
that
as
oh
no
said
miss
hope
in
great
confusion
i
did
mean
that
at
all
she
must
have
meant
it
you
do
talk
to
people
about
singing
in
the
middle
of
a
game
of
tennis
certainly
not
to
comparative
strangers
who
have
only
spilt
lemonade
over
your
frock
once
before
no
no
it
was
an
insult
and
it
nerved
me
to
a
great
effort
i
discarded
for
it
was
my
serve
the
hampstead
smash
i
discarded
the
peruvian
teaser
instead
i
served
two
piccadilly
benders
from
the
court
and
two
westminster
welts
from
the
the
piccadilly
bender
is
my
own
invention
it
can
only
be
served
from
the
one
court
and
it
must
have
a
wind
against
it
you
deliver
it
with
your
back
to
the
net
which
makes
the
striker
think
that
you
have
either
forgotten
all
about
the
game
or
else
are
apologising
to
the
spectators
for
your
previous
exhibition
then
with
a
violent
contortion
you
slue
your
body
round
and
serve
whereupon
your
opponent
perceives
that
you
playing
and
that
it
is
just
one
more
ordinary
fault
into
the
wrong
court
so
she
calls
fault
in
a
contemptuous
tone
and
drops
her
racquet
and
then
adds
hurriedly
oh
no
sorry
it
was
a
fault
after
all
that
being
where
the
wind
comes
in
the
westminster
welt
is
in
theory
the
same
as
the
hampstead
smash
but
goes
over
the
net
one
must
be
in
very
good
form
or
have
been
recently
insulted
to
bring
this
off
well
we
won
that
game
a
breeze
having
just
sprung
up
and
carried
away
by
enthusiasm
and
mutual
admiration
we
collected
another
then
it
was
miss
hope
serve
again
i
said
i
suppose
you
want
me
in
the
forefront
again
please
i
do
mind
shots
the
bottle
of
scent
is
absolutely
safe
but
i
afraid
he
win
another
packet
of
woodbines
miss
hope
started
off
with
a
double
which
was
rather
a
pity
and
then
gave
our
masculine
adversary
what
is
technically
called
one
to
kill
i
saw
instinctively
that
i
was
the
one
and
i
held
my
racquet
ready
with
both
hands
our
opponent
who
had
been
wanting
his
tea
for
the
last
two
games
was
in
no
mood
of
dalliance
he
fairly
let
himself
go
over
this
shot
in
a
moment
i
was
down
on
my
knees
behind
the
net
and
the
next
moment
i
saw
through
the
meshes
a
very
strange
thing
the
other
man
with
his
racquet
on
the
ground
was
holding
his
eye
with
both
hands
do
you
think
said
miss
hope
five
that
your
overhead
volleying
is
just
a
little
severe
xxvi
ten
and
eight
the
only
event
of
importance
last
week
was
my
victory
over
henry
by
ten
and
eight
if
you
do
want
to
hear
about
that
then
i
shall
have
to
pass
on
to
you
a
few
facts
about
his
you
rather
have
the
other
i
thought
so
the
difference
between
henry
and
me
is
that
he
is
what
i
should
call
a
good
golfer
and
i
am
what
everybody
else
calls
a
bad
golfer
in
consequence
of
this
he
insults
me
with
offers
of
bisques
i
have
ten
this
time
i
said
as
we
walked
to
the
tee
better
have
twelve
i
beat
you
with
eleven
yesterday
thank
you
i
said
haughtily
i
will
have
ten
it
is
true
that
he
beat
me
last
time
but
then
owing
to
bad
management
on
my
part
i
had
nine
bisques
left
at
the
moment
of
defeat
simply
eating
their
heads
off
henry
teed
up
and
drove
a
pink
spot
out
of
sight
henry
swears
by
the
pink
spot
if
there
is
anything
of
a
wind
i
use
either
a
quo
vadis
which
is
splendid
for
going
out
of
bounds
or
an
ostrich
which
has
a
wonderful
way
of
burying
itself
in
the
sand
i
followed
him
to
the
green
at
my
leisure
five
said
henry
seven
said
i
and
if
i
take
three
bisques
it
my
hole
you
must
only
take
one
at
a
time
protested
henry
why
there
nothing
in
baedeker
about
it
besides
i
will
only
take
one
at
a
time
if
it
makes
it
easier
for
you
i
take
one
and
that
brings
me
down
to
six
and
then
another
one
and
that
brings
me
down
to
five
and
then
another
one
and
that
brings
me
down
to
four
there
and
as
you
did
the
hole
in
five
i
win
well
of
course
if
you
like
to
waste
them
all
at
the
start
i
not
wasting
them
i
creating
a
moral
effect
behold
i
have
won
the
first
hole
let
us
be
photographed
together
henry
went
to
the
next
tee
slightly
ruffled
and
topped
his
ball
into
the
road
i
had
kept
mine
well
this
side
of
it
and
won
in
four
to
five
i
sha
take
any
bisques
here
i
said
two
up
at
the
third
tee
my
quo
vadis
darted
off
suddenly
to
the
left
and
tried
to
climb
the
hill
i
headed
it
off
and
gave
it
a
nasty
dent
from
behind
when
it
was
looking
and
with
my
next
shot
started
it
rolling
down
the
mountains
with
velocity
not
until
it
was
within
a
foot
of
the
pin
did
it
condescend
to
stop
henry
who
had
reached
the
green
with
his
drive
and
had
taken
one
putt
too
many
halved
the
hole
in
four
i
took
a
bisque
and
was
three
up
the
fourth
hole
was
prettily
played
by
both
of
us
and
with
two
bisques
i
had
it
absolutely
stiff
unnerved
by
this
henry
went
all
out
at
the
fifth
and
tried
to
carry
the
stream
in
two
unfortunately
i
mean
unfortunately
for
him
the
stream
was
six
inches
too
broad
in
the
particular
place
at
which
he
tried
to
carry
it
my
own
view
is
that
he
should
either
have
chosen
another
place
or
else
have
got
a
narrower
stream
from
somewhere
as
it
was
i
won
in
an
uneventful
six
and
took
with
a
bisque
the
short
hole
which
followed
six
up
i
pointed
out
to
henry
and
three
bisques
left
they
jolly
little
things
bisques
but
you
want
to
use
them
quickly
dat
qui
cito
does
the
sea
look
ripping
go
on
growled
henry
i
once
did
a
two
at
this
hole
i
said
as
i
teed
my
ball
if
i
did
a
two
now
and
took
a
bisque
you
have
to
do
it
in
nothing
in
order
to
win
a
solemn
thought
at
this
hole
you
have
to
drive
over
a
chasm
in
the
cliffs
my
ball
made
a
bee
line
for
the
beach
bounced
on
a
rock
and
disappeared
into
a
cave
henry
pink
spot
which
really
seemed
to
have
a
chance
of
winning
a
hole
at
last
found
the
wind
too
much
for
it
and
followed
me
below
i
in
this
cave
i
said
when
we
had
found
henry
ball
and
with
a
lighted
match
in
one
hand
and
a
niblick
in
the
other
i
went
in
and
tried
to
persuade
the
ostrich
to
come
out
my
eighth
argument
was
too
much
for
it
and
we
reappeared
in
the
daylight
together
how
many
i
asked
six
he
said
as
he
hit
the
top
of
the
cliff
once
more
and
shot
back
on
to
the
beach
i
left
him
and
chivied
my
ball
round
to
where
the
cliffs
are
lowest
then
i
got
it
gradually
on
to
a
little
mound
of
sand
very
delicate
work
this
took
a
terrific
swing
and
fairly
heaved
it
on
to
the
grass
two
more
strokes
put
me
on
to
the
green
in
twenty
i
lit
a
pipe
and
waited
for
henry
to
finish
his
game
of
rackets
i
played
he
shouted
then
you
want
some
of
my
bisques
i
said
i
can
lend
you
three
till
monday
henry
had
one
more
rally
and
then
picked
his
ball
up
i
had
won
seven
holes
and
i
had
three
bisques
with
which
to
win
the
match
i
was
a
little
doubtful
if
i
could
do
this
but
henry
settled
the
question
by
misjudging
yet
again
the
breadth
of
the
stream
what
is
experience
if
it
teaches
us
nothing
henry
must
really
try
to
enlarge
his
mind
about
rivers
dormy
nine
i
said
at
the
tenth
tee
and
no
bisques
left
thank
heaven
for
that
sighed
henry
but
i
have
only
to
halve
one
hole
out
of
nine
i
pointed
out
technically
i
am
on
what
is
known
as
velvet
oh
shut
up
and
drive
i
am
a
bad
golfer
but
even
bad
golfers
do
holes
in
bogey
now
and
then
in
the
ordinary
way
i
was
pretty
certain
to
halve
one
of
the
nine
holes
with
henry
and
so
win
the
match
both
the
eleventh
and
the
seventeenth
for
instance
are
favourites
of
mine
had
i
halved
one
of
those
he
would
have
admitted
cheerfully
that
i
had
played
good
golf
and
beaten
him
fairly
but
as
things
happened
what
happened
put
quite
briefly
was
this
bogey
for
the
tenth
is
four
i
hooked
my
drive
off
the
tee
and
down
a
little
gully
to
the
left
put
a
good
iron
shot
into
a
bunker
on
the
right
and
then
ran
down
a
putt
with
a
niblick
for
a
three
one
of
those
difficult
putts
luck
said
henry
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
i
been
missing
those
lately
i
said
your
match
said
henry
i
ca
play
against
luck
like
that
it
was
true
that
he
had
given
me
ten
bisques
but
on
the
other
hand
i
could
have
given
him
a
dozen
at
the
seventh
and
still
have
beaten
him
however
i
was
too
magnanimous
to
point
that
out
all
i
said
was
ten
and
eight
and
then
i
added
thoughtfully
i
do
think
i
ever
won
by
more
than
that
xxvii
an
inland
voyage
thomas
took
a
day
off
last
monday
in
order
to
play
golf
with
me
for
that
day
the
admiralty
had
to
get
along
without
thomas
i
tremble
to
think
what
would
have
happened
if
war
had
broken
out
on
monday
could
a
thomasless
admiralty
have
coped
with
it
i
trow
not
even
as
it
was
battleships
grounded
crews
mutinied
and
several
awkward
questions
in
the
house
of
commons
had
to
be
postponed
till
tuesday
something
some
premonition
of
this
no
doubt
seemed
to
be
weighing
on
him
all
day
rotten
weather
he
growled
as
he
came
up
the
steps
of
the
club
i
very
sorry
i
said
i
keep
on
complaining
to
the
secretary
about
it
he
does
his
best
what
that
he
taps
the
barometer
every
morning
and
says
it
will
clear
up
in
the
afternoon
shall
we
go
out
now
or
shall
we
give
it
a
chance
to
stop
thomas
looked
at
the
rain
and
decided
to
let
it
stop
i
made
him
as
comfortable
as
i
could
i
gave
him
a
drink
a
cigarette
and
with
the
on
the
table
at
his
elbow
i
had
in
reserve
play
with
the
and
a
west
middlesex
directory
for
myself
i
wandered
about
restlessly
pausing
now
and
again
to
read
enviously
a
notice
which
said
that
topping
handicap
was
reduced
from
to
lucky
man
at
about
eleven
the
rain
stopped
for
a
moment
and
we
hurried
out
the
course
is
a
little
wet
i
said
apologetically
as
we
stood
on
the
first
tee
but
with
your
naval
experience
you
wo
mind
that
by
the
way
i
ought
to
warn
you
that
this
is
all
casual
water
some
of
it
is
river
how
do
you
know
which
is
which
you
soon
find
out
the
river
is
much
deeper
go
on
your
drive
thomas
won
the
first
hole
very
easily
we
both
took
four
to
the
green
thomas
in
addition
having
five
splashes
of
mud
on
his
face
while
i
only
had
three
unfortunately
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
hole
was
under
water
thomas
the
bounder
had
a
small
heavy
ball
which
he
managed
to
sink
in
nine
my
own
being
lighter
refused
to
go
into
the
tin
at
all
and
floated
above
the
hole
in
the
most
exasperating
way
i
expect
there
a
rule
about
it
i
said
if
we
only
knew
which
gives
me
the
match
however
until
we
find
that
out
i
suppose
you
must
call
yourself
one
up
i
shall
want
some
dry
socks
for
lunch
he
muttered
as
he
splashed
off
to
the
tee
anything
you
want
for
lunch
you
can
have
my
dear
thomas
i
promise
you
that
you
shall
not
be
stinted
the
next
green
is
below
sea
level
altogether
i
afraid
the
first
in
the
water
wins
honours
it
turned
out
were
divided
i
lost
the
hole
and
thomas
lost
his
ball
the
third
tee
having
disappeared
we
moved
on
to
the
fourth
there
rather
a
nasty
place
along
here
i
said
the
secretary
was
sucked
in
the
other
day
and
only
rescued
by
the
hair
thomas
drove
a
good
one
i
topped
mine
badly
and
it
settled
down
in
the
mud
fifty
yards
off
excuse
me
i
shouted
as
i
ran
quickly
after
it
and
i
got
my
niblick
on
to
it
just
as
it
was
disappearing
it
was
a
very
close
thing
well
said
thomas
as
he
reached
his
ball
that
not
what
i
call
a
brassy
lie
it
what
we
call
a
corkscrew
lie
down
here
i
explained
if
you
have
got
a
corkscrew
you
better
dig
round
it
with
something
and
then
when
the
position
is
thoroughly
undermined
oh
good
shot
thomas
had
got
out
of
the
fairway
in
one
but
he
still
seemed
unhappy
my
eye
he
said
bending
down
in
agony
i
got
about
half
middlesex
in
it
he
walked
round
in
circles
saying
strange
nautical
things
and
my
suggestions
that
he
should
rub
the
other
eye
and
blow
his
nose
suddenly
were
received
ungenerously
anything
you
like
me
to
do
with
my
ears
he
asked
bitterly
if
you
come
and
take
some
mud
out
for
me
instead
of
talking
rot
i
approached
with
my
handkerchief
and
examined
the
eye
carefully
see
anything
asked
thomas
my
dear
thomas
it
of
turf
we
must
forget
to
replace
this
if
we
can
get
it
out
what
the
secretary
would
say
there
how
that
worse
than
ever
try
not
to
think
about
it
keep
the
eye
on
the
ball
as
much
as
possible
this
is
my
hole
by
the
way
your
ball
is
lost
how
do
you
know
i
saw
it
losing
itself
it
went
into
the
bad
place
i
told
you
about
it
gone
to
join
the
secretary
oh
no
we
got
him
out
of
course
i
keep
forgetting
anyhow
it
my
hole
i
think
i
shall
turn
my
trousers
up
again
said
thomas
bending
down
to
do
so
is
there
a
local
rule
about
it
no
it
is
left
entirely
to
the
discretion
and
good
taste
of
the
members
naturally
a
little
extra
license
is
allowed
on
a
very
muddy
day
of
course
if
oh
i
see
you
meant
a
local
rule
about
losing
your
ball
in
the
mud
no
i
do
know
of
one
unless
it
comes
under
the
heading
of
casual
land
be
a
sportsman
thomas
and
do
begrudge
me
the
hole
the
game
proceeded
and
we
reached
the
twelfth
tee
without
any
further
save
that
i
accidentally
lost
the
sixth
ninth
and
tenth
holes
and
that
thomas
lost
his
iron
at
the
eighth
he
had
carelessly
laid
it
down
for
a
moment
while
he
got
out
of
a
hole
with
his
niblick
and
when
he
turned
round
for
it
the
thing
was
gone
at
the
twelfth
tee
it
was
raining
harder
than
ever
we
pounded
along
with
our
up
and
reached
the
green
absolutely
wet
through
how
about
it
said
thomas
my
hole
i
think
and
that
makes
us
all
square
i
mean
how
about
the
rain
and
it
just
one
just
as
you
like
well
i
suppose
it
is
rather
wet
all
right
have
lunch
we
had
lunch
thomas
had
it
in
the
only
dry
things
he
had
brought
with
him
an
ulster
and
a
pair
of
vardon
cuffs
and
sat
as
near
the
fire
as
possible
it
was
still
raining
in
torrents
after
lunch
and
thomas
who
is
not
what
i
call
keen
about
golf
preferred
to
remain
before
the
fire
perhaps
he
was
right
i
raked
up
an
old
copy
of
with
the
for
him
and
read
bits
of
the
telephone
directory
out
aloud
after
tea
his
proper
clothes
were
dry
enough
in
places
to
put
on
and
as
it
was
still
raining
hard
and
he
seemed
disinclined
to
come
out
again
i
ordered
a
cab
for
us
both
it
really
rotten
luck
said
thomas
as
we
prepared
to
leave
that
on
the
one
day
when
i
take
a
holiday
it
should
be
so
beastly
beastly
thomas
i
said
in
amazement
the
day
i
afraid
you
do
play
inland
golf
much
i
hardly
ever
play
round
london
i
thought
not
then
let
me
tell
you
that
today
was
the
best
golf
i
had
for
three
weeks
golly
said
thomas
xxviii
one
of
our
sufferers
there
is
no
question
before
the
country
of
more
importance
than
that
of
national
health
in
my
own
small
way
i
have
made
something
of
a
study
of
it
and
when
a
royal
commission
begins
its
enquiries
i
shall
put
before
it
the
evidence
which
i
have
accumulated
i
shall
lay
particular
stress
upon
the
health
of
thomson
you
beat
me
he
said
as
he
swung
his
club
stiffly
on
the
first
tee
i
sha
be
able
to
hit
a
ball
you
should
have
some
lessons
i
suggested
thomson
gave
a
snort
of
indignation
it
not
that
he
said
but
i
been
very
seedy
lately
and
that
all
right
i
sha
mind
i
have
played
a
thoroughly
well
man
for
a
month
now
you
know
i
think
my
liver
i
held
up
my
hand
not
before
my
caddie
please
i
said
severely
he
is
quite
a
child
thomson
said
no
more
for
the
moment
but
hit
his
ball
hard
and
straight
along
the
ground
it
perfectly
absurd
he
said
with
a
shrug
i
sha
be
able
to
give
you
a
game
at
all
well
if
you
do
mind
playing
a
sick
man
not
if
you
do
mind
being
one
i
replied
and
drove
a
ball
which
also
went
along
the
ground
but
not
so
far
as
my
opponent
there
about
the
only
man
in
england
who
can
do
that
when
he
quite
well
the
ball
was
sitting
up
nicely
for
my
second
shot
and
i
managed
to
put
it
on
the
green
thomson
fifty
yards
farther
on
was
reclining
in
the
worst
part
of
a
bunker
which
he
had
forgotten
about
well
really
he
said
there
an
example
of
luck
for
you
your
ball
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
i
pleaded
do
be
angry
with
me
he
made
two
attempts
to
get
out
and
then
picked
his
ball
up
we
walked
in
silence
to
the
second
tee
this
time
i
said
i
shall
hit
the
sphere
properly
and
with
a
terrific
swing
i
stroked
it
gently
into
a
gorse
bush
i
looked
at
the
thing
in
disgust
and
then
felt
my
pulse
apparently
i
was
still
quite
well
thomson
forgetting
about
his
liver
drove
a
beauty
we
met
on
the
green
five
i
said
only
five
asked
thomson
suspiciously
six
i
said
holing
a
very
long
putt
thomson
health
had
a
relapse
he
took
four
short
putts
and
was
down
in
seven
it
really
rather
absurd
he
said
in
a
conversational
way
as
we
went
to
the
next
tee
that
putting
should
be
so
ridiculously
important
take
that
hole
for
instance
i
get
on
the
green
in
a
perfect
three
you
fluff
your
drive
completely
and
get
on
in
what
was
it
five
i
said
again
er
five
and
yet
you
win
the
hole
it
is
rather
absurd
is
it
i
often
thought
so
i
admitted
readily
that
is
to
say
when
taken
four
putts
i
two
up
on
the
third
tee
thomson
health
became
positively
alarming
he
missed
the
ball
altogether
it
ridiculous
to
try
to
play
he
said
with
a
forced
laugh
i
see
the
ball
at
all
it
still
there
i
assured
him
he
struck
at
it
again
and
it
hurried
off
into
a
ditch
look
here
he
said
would
you
rather
play
the
this
is
not
much
of
a
match
for
you
i
considered
of
course
a
game
with
the
pro
would
be
much
pleasanter
than
a
game
with
thomson
but
ought
i
to
leave
him
in
his
present
serious
condition
of
health
his
illness
was
approaching
its
critical
stage
and
it
was
my
duty
to
pull
him
through
if
i
could
no
no
i
said
let
go
on
the
fresh
air
will
do
you
good
perhaps
it
will
he
said
hopefully
i
sorry
i
like
this
but
had
a
cold
hanging
about
for
some
days
and
that
on
the
top
of
my
liver
quite
so
i
said
the
climax
was
reached
at
the
next
hole
when
with
several
strokes
in
hand
he
topped
his
approach
shot
into
a
bunker
for
my
sake
he
tried
to
look
as
though
he
had
meant
to
run
it
up
along
the
ground
having
forgotten
about
the
intervening
hazard
it
was
a
brave
effort
to
hide
from
me
the
real
state
of
his
health
but
he
soon
saw
that
it
was
hopeless
he
sighed
and
pressed
his
hand
to
his
eyes
then
he
held
his
fingers
a
foot
away
from
him
and
looked
at
them
as
if
he
were
trying
to
count
them
correctly
his
state
was
pitiable
and
i
felt
that
at
any
cost
i
must
save
him
i
did
the
corner
was
turned
at
the
fifth
where
i
took
four
putts
you
are
going
to
win
the
holes
he
said
grudgingly
as
he
ran
down
his
putt
convalescence
set
in
at
the
sixth
when
i
got
into
an
impossible
place
and
picked
up
oh
well
i
shall
give
you
a
game
yet
he
said
two
down
the
need
for
further
bulletins
ceased
at
the
seventh
hole
which
he
played
really
well
and
won
easily
you
wo
beat
me
by
much
he
said
in
spite
of
my
liver
by
the
way
how
is
the
liver
i
asked
your
cure
is
doing
it
good
of
course
it
may
come
on
again
but
he
drove
a
screamer
i
think
i
shall
be
all
right
he
announced
all
square
he
said
cheerily
at
the
ninth
i
fancy
i
going
to
beat
you
now
not
bad
you
know
considering
you
were
four
up
practically
speaking
i
gave
you
a
start
of
four
holes
i
decided
that
it
was
time
to
make
an
effort
again
seeing
that
thomson
health
was
now
thoroughly
of
the
next
seven
holes
i
managed
to
win
three
and
halve
two
it
is
only
fair
to
say
though
as
thomson
did
several
times
that
i
had
an
extraordinary
amount
of
good
luck
and
that
he
was
dogged
by
throughout
but
this
after
all
is
as
nothing
so
long
as
one
health
is
above
suspicion
the
great
thing
was
that
thomson
liver
suffered
no
relapse
even
though
at
the
seventeenth
tee
he
was
one
down
and
two
to
play
and
it
was
on
the
seventeenth
tee
that
i
had
to
think
seriously
how
i
wanted
the
match
to
end
thomson
at
lunch
when
he
has
won
is
a
very
different
man
from
thomson
at
lunch
when
he
has
lost
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
i
realised
that
i
was
in
rather
a
happy
position
if
i
won
i
won
which
was
jolly
if
i
lost
thomson
won
and
we
should
have
a
pleasant
lunch
however
as
it
happened
the
match
was
halved
yes
i
was
afraid
so
said
thomson
i
let
you
get
too
long
a
start
it
absurd
to
suppose
that
i
can
give
you
four
holes
up
and
beat
you
it
practically
amounts
to
giving
you
four
bisques
four
bisques
is
about
six
strokes
i
not
really
six
strokes
better
than
you
what
about
lunch
i
suggested
good
and
you
can
have
your
revenge
afterwards
he
led
the
way
into
the
pavilion
now
i
wonder
he
said
what
i
can
safely
eat
i
want
to
be
able
to
give
you
sort
of
a
game
this
afternoon
well
if
there
is
ever
a
royal
commission
upon
the
national
physique
i
shall
insist
on
giving
evidence
for
it
seems
to
me
that
golf
far
from
improving
the
health
of
the
country
is
actually
undermining
it
thomson
at
any
rate
since
he
has
taken
to
the
game
has
never
been
quite
fit
xxix
chum
it
is
chum
birthday
and
i
am
going
to
buy
him
a
little
whip
for
a
present
with
a
whistle
at
the
end
of
it
when
i
next
go
into
the
country
to
see
him
i
shall
take
it
with
me
and
explain
it
to
him
two
day
firmness
would
make
him
quite
a
sensible
dog
i
have
often
threatened
to
begin
the
treatment
on
my
very
next
visit
but
somehow
it
has
been
put
off
the
occasion
of
his
birthday
offers
a
last
opportunity
it
is
rather
absurd
though
to
talk
of
birthdays
in
connection
with
chum
for
he
has
been
no
more
than
three
months
old
since
we
have
had
him
he
is
a
black
spaniel
who
has
never
grown
up
he
has
a
beautiful
astrachan
coat
which
gleams
when
the
sun
is
on
it
but
he
stands
so
low
in
the
water
that
the
front
of
it
is
always
getting
dirty
and
his
ears
and
the
ends
of
his
trousers
trail
in
the
mud
a
great
authority
has
told
us
that
but
for
three
white
hairs
on
his
shirt
upon
so
little
do
class
distinctions
hang
he
would
be
a
cocker
of
irreproachable
birth
a
still
greater
authority
has
sworn
that
he
is
a
sussex
the
family
is
indifferent
it
only
calls
him
a
silly
ass
why
he
was
christened
chum
i
do
not
know
and
as
he
never
recognises
the
name
it
does
not
matter
when
he
first
came
to
stay
with
us
i
took
him
a
walk
round
the
village
i
wanted
to
show
him
the
lie
of
the
land
he
had
never
seen
the
country
before
and
was
full
of
interest
he
trotted
into
a
cottage
garden
and
came
back
with
something
to
show
me
you
never
guess
he
said
look
and
he
dropped
at
my
feet
a
chick
just
out
of
the
egg
i
smacked
his
head
and
took
him
into
the
cottage
to
explain
my
dog
i
said
has
eaten
one
of
your
chickens
chum
nudged
me
in
the
ankle
and
grinned
of
your
chickens
i
corrected
myself
looking
at
the
fresh
evidence
which
he
had
just
brought
to
light
you
do
want
me
any
more
said
chum
as
the
financial
arrangements
proceeded
then
i
just
go
and
find
somewhere
for
these
two
and
he
picked
them
up
and
trotted
into
the
sun
when
i
came
out
i
was
greeted
effusively
this
is
a
wonderful
day
he
panted
as
he
wriggled
his
body
i
know
the
country
was
like
this
what
do
we
do
now
we
go
home
i
said
and
we
went
that
was
chum
last
day
of
freedom
he
keeps
inside
the
front
gate
now
but
he
is
still
a
happy
dog
there
is
plenty
doing
in
the
garden
there
are
beds
to
walk
over
there
are
blackbirds
in
the
to
bark
at
the
world
is
still
full
of
wonderful
things
why
only
last
wednesday
he
will
tell
you
the
fishmonger
left
his
basket
in
the
drive
there
was
a
haddock
in
it
if
you
believe
me
for
breakfast
so
of
course
i
saved
it
for
him
i
put
it
on
the
grass
just
in
front
of
his
study
window
where
he
be
to
notice
it
bless
you
there
always
to
do
in
this
house
one
is
never
idle
and
even
when
there
is
nothing
doing
he
is
still
happy
waiting
cheerfully
upon
events
until
they
arrange
themselves
for
his
amusement
he
will
sit
for
twenty
minutes
opposite
the
garden
bank
watching
for
a
bumble
bee
to
come
out
of
its
hole
i
saw
him
go
in
he
says
to
himself
so
he
bound
to
come
out
extraordinary
interesting
world
but
to
his
inferiors
such
as
the
gardener
he
pretends
that
it
is
not
pleasure
but
duty
which
keeps
him
do
talk
to
me
fool
ca
you
see
that
i
got
a
job
on
here
chum
has
found
however
that
his
particular
mission
in
life
is
to
purge
his
master
garden
of
all
birds
this
keeps
him
busy
as
soon
as
he
sees
a
blackbird
on
the
lawn
he
is
in
full
cry
after
it
when
he
gets
to
the
place
and
finds
the
blackbird
gone
he
pretends
that
he
was
going
there
anyhow
he
gallops
round
in
circles
rolls
over
once
or
twice
and
then
trots
back
again
you
did
think
i
was
such
a
fool
as
to
try
to
catch
a
he
says
to
us
no
i
was
just
taking
a
little
run
splendid
thing
for
the
figure
and
it
is
just
chum
little
runs
over
the
beds
which
call
aloud
for
firmness
which
in
fact
have
inspired
my
birthday
present
to
him
but
there
is
this
difficulty
to
overcome
first
when
he
came
to
live
with
us
an
arrangement
was
entered
into
so
he
says
by
which
one
bed
was
given
to
him
as
his
own
in
that
bed
he
could
wander
at
will
burying
bones
and
biscuits
hunting
birds
this
may
have
been
so
but
it
is
a
pity
that
nobody
but
chum
knows
definitely
which
is
the
bed
chum
you
bounder
i
shout
as
he
is
about
to
wade
through
the
herbaceous
border
he
takes
no
notice
he
struggles
through
to
the
other
side
but
a
sudden
thought
strikes
him
and
he
pushes
his
way
back
again
did
you
call
me
he
says
how
you
walk
over
the
flowers
he
comes
up
meekly
i
suppose
i
done
wrong
he
says
but
i
ca
what
i
smack
his
head
for
him
he
waits
until
he
is
quite
sure
i
have
finished
and
then
jumps
up
with
a
bark
wipes
his
paws
on
my
trousers
and
trots
into
the
herbaceous
border
again
chum
i
cry
he
sits
down
in
it
and
looks
all
round
him
in
amazement
my
own
bed
he
murmurs
to
me
i
do
know
what
it
is
in
him
which
so
catches
hold
of
you
his
way
of
sitting
a
reproachful
statue
motionless
outside
the
window
of
whomever
he
wants
to
come
out
and
play
with
him
until
you
can
bear
it
no
longer
but
must
either
go
into
the
garden
or
draw
down
the
blinds
for
one
day
his
habit
when
you
out
of
sitting
up
on
his
back
legs
and
begging
you
with
his
front
paws
to
come
and
something
a
trick
entirely
of
his
own
invention
for
no
one
would
think
of
teaching
him
anything
his
funny
nautical
roll
when
he
walks
which
is
nearly
a
swagger
and
gives
him
always
the
air
of
having
just
come
back
from
some
rather
dashing
adventure
beyond
all
this
there
is
still
something
and
whatever
it
is
it
is
something
which
every
now
and
then
compels
you
to
bend
down
and
catch
hold
of
his
long
silky
ears
to
look
into
his
honest
eyes
and
say
you
silly
old
ass
you
old
old
ass
xxx
under
entirely
new
management
i
know
a
fool
of
a
dog
who
pretends
that
he
is
a
cocker
spaniel
and
is
convinced
that
the
world
revolves
round
him
wonderingly
the
sun
rises
so
it
may
shine
on
his
glossy
morning
coat
it
sets
so
his
master
may
know
that
it
is
time
for
the
evening
biscuit
if
the
rain
falls
it
is
that
a
fool
of
a
dog
may
wipe
on
his
mistress
skirts
his
muddy
boots
his
day
is
always
exciting
always
full
of
the
same
good
thing
his
night
a
repetition
of
his
day
more
gloriously
developed
if
there
be
a
sacred
moment
before
the
dawn
when
he
lies
awake
and
ponders
on
life
he
tells
himself
confidently
that
it
will
go
on
for
ever
like
this
a
life
planned
nobly
for
himself
but
one
in
which
the
master
and
mistress
whom
he
protects
must
always
find
a
place
and
i
think
perhaps
he
would
want
a
place
for
me
too
in
that
life
who
am
not
his
real
master
but
yet
one
of
the
house
i
hope
he
would
what
chum
does
know
is
this
his
master
and
mistress
are
leaving
him
they
are
going
to
a
part
of
the
world
where
a
fool
of
a
dog
with
no
manners
is
a
nuisance
if
chum
could
see
all
the
good
little
london
dogs
who
at
home
sit
languidly
on
their
mistress
lap
and
abroad
take
their
view
of
life
through
a
muff
much
bigger
than
themselves
if
he
could
see
the
big
obedient
dogs
who
walk
solemnly
through
the
park
carrying
their
master
stick
never
pausing
in
their
impressive
march
unless
it
be
to
plunge
into
the
serpentine
and
rescue
a
drowning
child
he
would
know
what
i
mean
he
would
admit
that
a
dog
who
can
not
answer
to
his
own
name
and
pays
but
little
more
attention
to
down
idiot
and
come
here
fool
is
not
every
place
dog
he
would
admit
it
if
he
had
time
but
before
i
could
have
called
his
attention
to
half
the
good
dogs
i
had
marked
out
he
would
have
sat
down
beaming
in
front
of
a
and
then
he
would
never
have
known
what
now
he
will
know
so
soon
that
his
master
and
mistress
are
leaving
him
it
has
been
my
business
to
find
a
new
home
for
him
it
is
harder
than
you
think
i
can
make
him
sound
lovable
but
i
can
not
make
him
sound
good
of
course
i
might
leave
out
his
doubtful
qualities
and
describe
him
merely
as
beautiful
and
affectionate
i
might
but
i
could
i
think
chum
habitual
smile
would
get
larger
he
would
wriggle
the
end
of
himself
more
ecstatically
than
ever
if
he
heard
himself
summed
up
as
beautiful
and
affectionate
anyway
i
could
do
it
for
i
get
carried
away
when
i
speak
of
him
and
i
reveal
all
his
bad
qualities
i
am
afraid
he
is
a
snob
i
confessed
to
one
woman
of
whom
i
had
hopes
he
does
much
care
for
what
he
calls
the
lower
classes
oh
she
said
yes
he
hates
badly
dressed
people
corduroy
trousers
tied
up
at
the
knee
always
excite
him
i
do
know
if
any
of
your
family
no
i
suppose
not
but
if
he
ever
sees
a
man
with
his
trousers
tied
up
at
the
knee
he
goes
for
him
and
he
ca
bear
tradespeople
at
least
not
the
men
he
loves
he
rather
likes
the
too
once
when
he
was
left
alone
with
it
for
a
moment
he
appeared
shortly
afterwards
on
the
lawn
with
a
pair
of
well
i
mean
he
had
no
business
with
them
at
all
we
got
them
away
after
a
bit
of
a
chase
and
then
they
had
to
go
to
the
wash
again
it
seemed
rather
a
pity
when
they
only
just
come
back
of
course
i
smacked
his
head
for
him
but
he
looks
so
surprised
and
reproachful
when
he
done
wrong
that
you
never
feel
quite
his
fault
i
doubt
if
i
shall
be
able
to
take
him
after
all
she
said
i
just
remembered
i
forget
what
it
was
she
remembered
but
it
meant
that
i
was
still
without
a
new
home
for
chum
what
does
he
eat
somebody
else
asked
me
it
seemed
hopeful
i
could
see
chum
already
installed
officially
i
said
he
lives
on
puppy
biscuits
he
also
has
the
after
breakfast
and
an
occasional
bone
privately
he
is
fond
of
bees
i
have
seen
him
eat
as
many
as
six
bees
in
an
afternoon
sometimes
he
wanders
down
to
the
and
picks
the
gooseberries
he
likes
all
fruit
but
gooseberries
are
the
things
he
can
reach
best
when
there
are
any
gooseberries
about
he
has
to
be
content
with
the
hips
and
haws
from
the
but
really
you
need
bother
he
can
eat
anything
the
only
thing
he
does
like
is
whitening
we
were
just
going
to
mark
the
lawn
one
day
and
while
we
were
busy
pegging
it
out
he
wandered
up
and
drank
the
whitening
out
of
the
marker
it
is
practically
the
only
disappointment
he
has
ever
had
he
looked
at
us
and
you
could
see
that
his
opinion
of
us
had
gone
down
did
you
it
there
for
if
you
did
mean
me
to
drink
it
he
said
reproachfully
then
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
and
thoughtfully
back
to
his
kennel
he
never
came
out
till
next
morning
really
said
my
man
well
i
shall
have
to
think
about
it
i
let
you
know
of
course
i
knew
what
that
meant
with
a
third
to
whom
i
spoke
the
negotiations
came
to
grief
not
apparently
because
of
any
faults
of
chum
but
because
if
you
will
believe
it
of
my
own
shortcomings
at
least
i
can
suppose
nothing
else
for
this
man
had
been
enthusiastic
about
him
he
had
revelled
in
the
tale
of
chum
wickedness
he
had
adored
him
for
being
so
conceited
he
had
practically
said
that
he
would
take
him
do
i
begged
i
sure
he
be
happy
with
you
you
see
he
not
everybody
dog
i
mean
i
do
want
any
odd
man
whom
i
do
know
to
take
him
it
must
be
a
friend
of
mine
so
that
i
shall
often
be
able
to
see
chum
afterwards
so
that
what
he
asked
anxiously
so
that
i
shall
often
be
able
to
see
chum
afterwards
you
know
and
so
on
i
could
bear
to
lose
the
silly
old
ass
altogether
he
looked
thoughtful
and
when
i
went
on
to
speak
about
chum
fondness
for
chickens
and
his
other
lovable
ways
he
changed
the
subject
altogether
he
wrote
afterwards
that
he
was
sorry
he
could
manage
with
a
third
dog
and
i
like
to
think
he
was
not
afraid
of
chum
but
only
of
me
but
i
have
found
the
right
man
at
last
a
day
will
come
soon
when
i
shall
take
chum
from
his
present
home
to
his
new
one
that
will
be
a
great
day
for
him
i
can
see
him
in
the
train
wiping
his
boots
effusively
on
every
new
passenger
wriggling
under
the
seat
and
out
again
from
sheer
joy
of
life
i
can
see
him
in
the
taxi
taking
his
one
brief
impression
of
a
world
that
means
nothing
to
him
i
can
see
him
in
another
train
joyous
eager
putting
his
paws
on
my
collar
from
time
to
time
and
saying
excitedly
what
a
day
this
is
and
if
he
survives
the
journey
if
i
can
keep
him
on
the
way
from
all
delightful
deaths
he
longs
to
try
if
i
can
get
him
safely
to
his
new
house
then
i
can
see
him
well
i
wonder
what
will
they
do
to
him
when
i
see
him
again
will
he
be
a
sober
little
dog
answering
to
his
name
careful
to
keep
his
muddy
feet
off
the
visitor
trousers
grown
up
obedient
following
to
heel
round
the
garden
the
faithful
servant
of
his
master
or
will
he
be
the
same
old
silly
ass
no
use
to
anybody
always
dirty
always
smiling
always
in
the
way
a
clumsy
blundering
fool
of
a
dog
who
knows
you
ca
help
loving
him
i
wonder
between
ourselves
i
do
think
they
alter
him
now
oh
i
hope
they
ca
xxxi
a
farewell
tour
this
is
positively
chum
last
appearance
in
print
for
his
own
sake
no
less
than
for
yours
he
is
conceited
enough
as
it
is
but
if
once
he
got
to
know
that
people
are
always
writing
about
him
in
books
his
swagger
would
be
unbearable
however
i
have
said
to
him
now
i
have
no
longer
any
rights
in
him
yesterday
i
saw
him
off
to
his
new
home
and
when
we
meet
again
it
will
be
on
a
different
footing
is
that
your
dog
i
shall
say
to
his
master
what
is
he
a
cocker
jolly
little
fellows
are
they
i
had
one
myself
once
as
chum
refused
to
do
the
journey
across
london
by
himself
i
met
him
at
liverpool
street
he
came
up
in
a
crate
the
world
must
have
seemed
very
small
to
him
on
the
way
hallo
old
ass
i
said
to
him
through
the
bars
and
in
the
little
space
they
gave
him
he
wriggled
his
body
with
delight
thank
heaven
there
of
alive
he
said
i
think
this
is
my
dog
i
said
to
the
guard
and
i
told
him
my
name
he
asked
for
my
card
i
afraid
i
have
one
with
me
i
explained
when
policemen
touch
me
on
the
shoulder
and
ask
me
to
go
quietly
when
i
drag
old
gentlemen
from
underneath
and
they
decide
to
adopt
me
on
the
spot
on
all
the
important
occasions
when
one
really
wants
a
card
i
never
have
one
with
me
ca
give
him
up
without
proof
of
identity
said
the
guard
and
chum
grinned
at
the
idea
of
being
thought
so
valuable
i
felt
in
my
pockets
for
letters
there
was
only
one
but
it
offered
to
lend
me
on
my
note
of
hand
alone
it
was
addressed
to
dear
sir
and
though
i
pointed
out
to
the
guard
that
i
was
the
sir
he
still
kept
tight
hold
of
chum
strange
that
one
man
should
be
prepared
to
trust
me
with
and
another
should
be
so
chary
of
confiding
to
me
a
small
black
spaniel
tell
the
gentleman
who
i
am
i
said
imploringly
through
the
bars
show
him
you
know
me
he
all
right
said
chum
looking
at
the
guard
with
his
great
honest
brown
eyes
he
been
with
us
for
years
and
then
i
had
an
inspiration
i
turned
down
the
inside
pocket
of
my
coat
and
there
stitched
into
it
was
the
label
of
my
tailor
with
my
name
written
on
it
i
had
often
wondered
why
tailors
did
this
obviously
they
know
how
stupid
guards
can
be
i
suppose
that
all
right
said
the
guard
reluctantly
of
course
i
might
have
stolen
the
coat
i
see
his
point
you
you
would
like
a
nice
packing
case
for
yourself
i
said
timidly
you
see
i
thought
i
put
chum
on
the
lead
i
got
to
take
him
to
paddington
and
he
must
be
tired
of
his
shell
by
now
it
is
as
if
he
were
an
armadillo
the
guard
thought
he
would
like
a
shilling
and
a
nice
packing
case
wood
he
agreed
was
always
wood
particularly
in
winter
but
there
were
times
when
you
were
not
ready
for
it
how
are
you
taking
him
he
asked
getting
to
work
with
a
chisel
underground
underground
i
cried
in
horror
take
chum
on
the
underground
take
have
you
ever
taken
a
large
live
on
the
end
of
a
string
into
a
crowded
carriage
the
guard
never
had
well
do
take
him
in
a
taxi
instead
do
waste
him
on
other
people
the
crate
yawned
slowly
and
chum
emerged
all
over
straw
we
had
an
anxious
moment
but
the
two
of
us
got
him
down
and
put
the
lead
on
him
then
chum
and
i
went
off
for
a
taxi
hooray
said
chum
wriggling
all
over
is
this
splendid
i
say
which
way
are
you
going
i
going
this
way
no
i
mean
the
other
way
somebody
had
left
some
of
his
on
the
platform
three
times
we
went
round
one
in
opposite
directions
and
unwound
ourselves
the
wrong
way
then
i
hauled
him
in
took
him
struggling
in
my
arms
and
got
into
a
cab
the
journey
to
paddington
was
full
of
interest
for
a
whole
minute
chum
stood
quietly
on
the
seat
rested
his
on
the
open
window
and
drank
in
london
then
he
jumped
down
and
went
mad
he
tried
to
hang
me
with
the
lead
and
then
in
remorse
tried
to
hang
himself
he
made
a
dash
for
the
little
window
at
the
back
missed
it
and
dived
out
of
the
window
at
the
side
was
hauled
back
and
kissed
me
ecstatically
in
the
eye
with
his
sharpest
tooth
and
i
thought
the
world
was
at
an
end
he
said
and
there
were
no
more
people
oh
i
am
an
ass
i
say
did
you
notice
i
had
my
hair
cut
how
do
you
like
my
new
trousers
i
must
show
you
them
he
jumped
on
to
my
lap
no
i
think
you
see
them
better
on
the
ground
he
said
and
jumped
down
again
or
no
perhaps
you
get
a
better
view
if
he
jumped
up
hastily
and
yet
i
know
he
dived
down
though
of
course
if
you
oh
lor
this
a
day
and
he
put
both
paws
lovingly
on
my
collar
suddenly
he
was
quiet
again
the
stillness
the
absence
of
storm
in
the
taxi
was
so
unnatural
that
i
began
to
miss
it
buck
up
old
fool
i
said
but
he
sat
motionless
by
my
side
plunged
in
thought
i
tried
to
cheer
him
up
i
pointed
out
king
cross
to
him
he
would
even
bark
at
it
i
called
his
attention
to
the
poster
outside
euston
theatre
of
the
two
biffs
for
all
the
regard
he
showed
he
might
never
even
have
heard
of
them
the
monumental
masonry
by
portland
road
failed
to
uplift
him
at
baker
street
he
woke
up
and
grinned
cheerily
it
all
right
he
said
i
was
trying
to
remember
what
happened
to
me
this
morning
something
rather
miserable
i
thought
but
i
ca
get
hold
of
it
however
it
all
right
now
how
are
and
he
went
mad
again
at
paddington
i
bought
a
label
at
the
and
wrote
it
for
him
he
went
round
and
round
my
leg
looking
for
me
funny
thing
he
said
as
he
began
to
unwind
he
was
here
a
moment
ago
i
just
go
round
once
more
i
rather
think
oh
there
you
are
i
stepped
off
him
unravelled
the
lead
and
dragged
him
to
the
parcels
office
i
want
to
send
this
by
the
two
train
i
said
to
the
man
the
other
side
of
the
counter
send
what
he
said
i
looked
down
chum
was
making
himself
very
small
and
black
in
the
shadow
of
the
counter
he
was
completely
hidden
from
the
sight
of
anybody
the
other
side
of
it
come
out
i
said
and
show
yourself
not
much
he
said
a
parcel
i
not
going
to
be
a
jolly
old
parcel
for
anybody
it
only
a
way
of
speaking
i
pleaded
actually
you
are
travelling
as
a
small
black
gentleman
you
will
go
with
the
guard
a
delightful
man
chum
came
out
reluctantly
the
clerk
leant
over
the
counter
and
managed
to
see
him
according
to
our
regulations
he
said
and
i
always
dislike
people
who
begin
like
that
he
has
to
be
on
a
chain
a
leather
lead
wo
do
chum
smiled
all
over
himself
i
do
know
which
pleased
him
more
the
suggestion
that
he
was
a
very
large
and
fierce
dog
or
the
impossibility
now
of
his
travelling
with
the
guard
delightful
man
though
he
might
be
he
gave
himself
a
shake
and
started
for
the
door
tut
tut
it
a
great
disappointment
to
me
he
said
trying
to
look
disappointed
but
his
back
wriggle
this
chain
business
silly
of
us
not
to
have
known
well
well
we
shall
be
wiser
another
time
now
let
go
home
poor
old
chum
i
known
from
a
large
coat
pocket
i
produced
a
chain
it
said
chum
looking
up
at
me
pathetically
you
might
almost
to
get
rid
of
me
he
was
chained
and
the
label
tied
on
to
him
forgive
me
that
label
chum
i
think
that
was
the
worst
offence
of
all
and
why
should
i
label
one
who
was
speaking
so
eloquently
for
himself
who
said
from
the
tip
of
his
little
black
nose
to
the
end
of
his
stumpy
black
tail
i
a
silly
old
ass
but
there
nothing
wrong
in
me
and
they
sending
me
away
but
according
to
the
regulations
one
must
obey
the
regulations
chum
i
gave
him
to
the
guard
a
delightful
man
the
guard
and
i
chained
him
to
a
brake
or
something
then
the
guard
went
away
and
chum
and
i
had
a
little
talk
after
that
the
train
went
off
little
dog
indoors
xxxii
physical
culture
why
do
you
sit
up
said
adela
at
dinner
suddenly
prodding
me
in
the
back
adela
is
old
enough
to
take
a
motherly
interest
in
my
figure
and
young
enough
to
look
extremely
pretty
while
doing
so
i
always
stoop
at
meals
i
explained
it
helps
the
circulation
my
own
idea
but
it
looks
so
bad
you
ought
do
improve
me
i
begged
no
wonder
you
have
hush
i
have
i
got
a
bullet
on
the
liver
in
the
campaign
of
due
to
over
smoking
and
sometimes
it
hurts
me
a
little
in
the
cold
weather
that
all
why
do
you
try
the
hyperion
i
will
where
is
it
it
is
anywhere
you
buy
it
oh
i
thought
you
dined
at
it
what
do
you
buy
it
for
it
one
of
those
developers
with
elastics
and
pulleys
and
so
on
every
morning
early
for
half
an
hour
before
breakfast
you
trying
to
improve
me
i
said
suspiciously
but
they
are
such
good
things
went
on
adela
earnestly
they
really
do
help
to
make
you
beautiful
i
beautiful
well
much
more
beautiful
and
strong
are
you
being
simply
as
tactful
as
you
can
be
and
graceful
it
is
as
though
you
were
actually
a
relation
i
protested
adela
continued
full
of
her
idea
it
would
do
you
so
much
good
you
know
would
you
promise
me
to
use
it
every
day
if
i
sent
you
mine
why
do
you
want
yours
any
more
are
you
perfect
now
you
can
easily
hook
it
to
the
wall
i
suppose
i
reflected
there
is
a
limit
of
beauty
beyond
which
it
is
dangerous
to
go
after
that
either
the
thing
would
come
off
its
hook
or
well
said
adela
suddenly
are
i
looking
well
you
looking
radiant
i
said
appreciatively
but
it
may
only
be
because
you
going
to
marry
billy
next
month
she
smiled
and
blushed
well
i
send
it
to
you
she
said
and
you
try
it
for
a
week
and
then
tell
me
if
you
do
feel
better
oh
and
do
do
all
the
exercises
to
begin
with
start
with
three
or
four
of
the
easy
ones
of
course
i
said
i
undid
the
wrappings
eagerly
took
off
the
lid
of
the
box
and
was
confronted
with
apparently
six
pairs
of
braces
i
shook
them
out
of
the
box
and
saw
i
had
made
a
mistake
it
was
one
pair
of
braces
for
magog
i
picked
it
up
and
i
knew
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
the
hyperion
in
five
minutes
i
had
screwed
a
hook
into
the
bedroom
wall
and
attached
the
beautifier
then
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
looked
at
it
there
was
a
tin
plate
fastened
to
the
top
with
the
word
ladies
on
it
i
got
up
removed
it
with
a
knife
and
sat
down
again
everything
was
very
dusty
and
i
wondered
when
adela
had
last
developed
herself
i
went
into
the
other
room
to
see
if
i
had
overlooked
anything
i
found
on
the
floor
a
chart
of
exercises
and
returned
triumphantly
with
it
there
were
thirty
exercises
altogether
and
the
chart
gave
you
a
detailed
explanation
of
how
to
do
each
particular
exercise
a
photograph
of
a
lady
doing
it
after
all
i
reassured
myself
after
the
first
bashful
glance
it
is
adela
who
has
thrust
this
upon
me
and
she
must
have
known
so
i
studied
it
nos
and
seemed
the
easiest
i
decided
to
confine
myself
to
them
for
the
first
of
these
you
strap
yourself
in
at
the
waist
grasp
the
handles
and
fall
slowly
backwards
until
your
head
touches
the
floor
all
the
elastic
cords
being
then
at
full
stretch
when
i
had
got
very
slowly
halfway
down
an
extra
piece
of
elastic
which
had
got
hitched
somewhere
came
suddenly
into
play
and
i
did
the
rest
of
the
journey
without
a
stop
finishing
up
sharply
against
the
the
chart
had
said
inhale
going
down
and
i
was
inhaling
hard
at
the
moment
that
the
and
two
damp
towels
spread
themselves
over
my
face
so
much
for
exercise
i
thought
as
i
got
up
i
just
get
the
idea
and
then
start
properly
now
for
no
somehow
i
felt
instinctively
that
no
would
cause
trouble
for
no
you
stand
on
the
right
foot
fasten
the
left
foot
to
one
of
the
cords
and
stretch
it
out
as
far
as
you
can
what
officially
you
do
then
i
can
not
say
some
people
can
stand
easily
upon
the
right
foot
when
the
left
is
fastened
to
the
wall
others
can
not
it
is
a
gift
having
recovered
from
my
spontaneous
rendering
of
no
i
turned
to
no
this
one
i
realised
was
extremely
important
i
would
do
it
twelve
times
you
begin
by
lying
flat
on
the
floor
roped
in
at
the
waist
and
with
your
hands
grasping
the
elastic
cords
held
straight
up
in
the
air
the
tension
on
your
waist
is
then
extreme
but
on
your
hands
only
moderate
then
taking
a
deep
breath
you
pull
your
arms
slowly
out
until
they
lie
along
the
floor
the
tension
becomes
terrific
the
strain
on
every
part
of
you
is
immense
while
i
lay
there
taking
a
deep
breath
before
relaxing
i
said
to
myself
the
strain
will
be
too
much
for
me
i
was
wrong
it
was
too
much
for
the
hook
the
hook
whizzed
out
everything
flew
at
me
at
once
and
i
remembered
no
more
as
i
limped
into
bed
i
trod
heavily
upon
something
sharp
i
shrieked
and
bent
down
to
see
what
had
bitten
me
it
was
a
tin
plate
bearing
the
word
ladies
well
said
adela
a
week
later
i
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
when
did
you
last
use
the
hyperion
i
asked
about
a
year
ago
ah
you
do
remember
the
chart
that
went
with
it
not
well
except
of
course
that
each
exercise
was
arranged
for
a
particular
object
according
to
what
you
wanted
exactly
so
i
discovered
yesterday
it
was
in
very
small
type
and
i
missed
it
at
first
well
how
many
did
you
do
i
limited
myself
to
exercises
and
do
you
happen
to
remember
what
those
are
for
not
particularly
no
well
i
started
with
no
no
you
may
recall
is
one
of
the
most
perilous
i
nearly
died
over
no
and
when
i
had
been
doing
it
for
a
week
i
discovered
what
its
particular
object
was
what
round
the
forearm
yes
madam
i
said
bitterly
i
have
spent
a
week
of
agony
and
i
have
rounded
one
forearm
why
did
you
try
another
i
did
i
tried
no
six
times
in
the
pursuit
of
no
have
i
been
shot
up
to
the
ceiling
by
the
left
foot
and
what
for
adela
arch
the
instep
look
at
my
instep
why
should
i
to
arch
it
i
wish
i
could
remember
which
chart
i
sent
you
said
adela
wrinkling
her
brow
it
was
the
wrong
one
i
said
there
was
a
long
silence
oh
said
adela
suddenly
you
never
told
me
about
no
pardon
me
i
said
i
can
not
bear
to
speak
of
why
was
it
even
more
unsuitable
than
the
other
two
i
found
when
i
had
done
it
six
times
that
its
object
was
stated
to
be
remove
double
chin
that
however
was
not
the
real
effect
and
so
i
crossed
out
the
false
comment
and
wrote
the
true
one
in
its
place
and
what
is
that
asked
adela
remove
the
i
said
gloomily
xxxiii
an
insurance
act
of
course
i
had
always
known
that
a
medical
examination
was
a
necessary
preliminary
to
insurance
but
in
my
own
case
i
had
expected
the
thing
to
be
the
merest
formality
the
doctor
having
seen
at
a
glance
what
a
fine
strong
healthy
fellow
i
was
would
look
casually
at
my
tongue
apologise
for
having
doubted
it
enquire
genially
what
my
grandfather
had
died
of
and
show
me
to
the
door
this
idea
of
mine
was
fostered
by
the
excellent
testimonial
which
i
had
written
myself
at
the
company
bidding
are
you
suffering
from
any
constitutional
disease
have
you
ever
had
gout
are
you
deformed
are
you
of
strictly
sober
and
temperate
habits
i
mean
my
replies
had
been
a
model
of
what
an
assurance
company
expects
then
why
the
need
of
a
doctor
however
they
insisted
the
doctor
began
quietly
enough
he
asked
as
i
had
anticipated
after
the
health
of
my
relations
i
said
that
they
were
very
fit
and
not
to
be
outdone
in
politeness
expressed
the
hope
that
his
people
too
were
keeping
well
in
this
trying
weather
he
wondered
if
i
drank
much
i
said
oh
well
perhaps
i
will
with
an
apologetic
smile
and
looked
round
for
the
sideboard
unfortunately
he
did
not
pursue
the
matter
and
now
he
said
after
the
hundredth
question
i
should
like
to
look
at
your
chest
i
had
seen
it
coming
for
some
time
in
vain
i
had
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
to
lead
him
back
to
the
subject
of
drinks
or
my
relations
it
was
no
good
he
was
evidently
determined
to
see
my
chest
nothing
could
move
him
from
his
resolve
trembling
i
prepared
for
the
encounter
what
terrible
disease
was
he
going
to
discover
he
began
by
tapping
me
briskly
all
over
in
a
series
of
for
the
most
part
one
at
any
point
appeared
to
satisfy
him
but
occasionally
there
would
be
no
answer
and
he
would
knock
again
at
one
spot
he
knocked
four
times
before
he
could
make
himself
heard
this
i
said
to
myself
at
the
third
knock
has
torn
it
i
shall
be
ploughed
and
i
sent
an
urgent
message
to
my
chest
for
sake
do
something
you
fool
ca
you
hear
the
gentleman
i
suppose
that
roused
it
for
at
the
next
knock
he
passed
on
to
an
adjacent
spot
um
he
said
when
he
called
everywhere
um
i
wonder
what
i
done
i
thought
to
myself
i
do
believe
he
likes
my
chest
without
a
word
he
got
out
his
stethoscope
and
began
to
listen
to
me
as
luck
would
have
it
he
struck
something
interesting
almost
at
once
and
for
what
seemed
hours
he
stood
there
listening
and
listening
to
it
but
it
was
boring
for
me
because
i
really
had
very
little
to
do
i
could
have
bitten
him
in
the
neck
with
some
ease
or
i
might
have
licked
his
ear
beyond
that
nothing
seemed
to
offer
i
moistened
my
lips
and
spoke
am
i
dying
i
asked
in
a
broken
voice
do
talk
he
said
just
breathe
naturally
i
am
dying
i
thought
and
he
is
hiding
it
from
me
it
was
a
terrible
reflection
um
he
said
and
moved
on
he
went
and
listened
behind
my
back
it
is
very
bad
form
to
listen
behind
a
person
back
i
did
not
tell
him
so
however
i
wanted
him
to
like
me
yes
he
said
now
cough
i
have
a
cough
i
pointed
out
make
the
noise
of
coughing
he
said
severely
extremely
nervous
i
did
my
celebrated
imitation
of
a
man
with
an
irritating
cough
h
h
h
h
yes
said
the
doctor
go
on
he
likes
it
i
said
to
myself
and
he
must
obviously
be
an
excellent
judge
i
shall
devote
more
time
to
mimicry
in
future
h
h
h
the
doctor
came
round
to
where
i
could
see
him
again
now
cough
like
this
he
said
honk
honk
i
gave
my
celebrated
imitation
of
a
sick
rhinoceros
gasping
out
its
life
it
went
well
i
got
an
encore
um
he
said
gravely
um
he
put
his
stethoscope
away
and
looked
earnestly
at
me
tell
me
the
worst
i
begged
i
not
bothering
about
this
stupid
insurance
business
now
that
off
of
course
but
how
long
have
i
i
must
put
my
affairs
in
order
can
you
promise
me
a
week
he
said
nothing
he
took
my
wrists
in
his
hands
and
pressed
them
it
was
evident
that
grief
him
and
that
he
was
taking
a
silent
farewell
of
me
i
bowed
my
head
then
determined
to
bear
my
like
a
man
i
said
firmly
so
be
it
and
drew
myself
away
from
him
however
he
would
let
me
go
come
come
i
said
to
him
you
must
not
give
way
and
i
made
an
effort
to
release
one
of
my
hands
meaning
to
pat
him
encouragingly
on
the
shoulder
he
resisted
i
realised
suddenly
that
i
had
mistaken
his
meaning
and
that
he
was
simply
feeling
my
pulses
um
he
said
um
and
continued
to
finger
my
wrists
clenching
my
teeth
and
with
the
veins
staring
out
on
my
forehead
i
worked
my
pulses
as
hard
as
i
could
ah
he
said
as
i
finished
tying
my
tie
and
he
got
up
from
the
desk
where
he
had
been
making
notes
of
my
disastrous
case
and
came
over
to
me
there
is
just
one
thing
more
sit
down
i
sat
down
now
cross
your
knees
i
crossed
my
knees
he
bent
over
me
and
gave
me
a
sharp
tap
below
the
knee
with
the
side
of
his
hand
my
chest
may
have
disappointed
him
he
may
have
disliked
my
back
possibly
i
was
a
complete
failure
with
my
pulses
but
i
knew
the
this
time
he
should
not
be
disappointed
i
was
taking
no
risks
almost
before
his
hand
reached
my
knee
my
foot
shot
out
and
took
him
fairly
under
the
chin
his
face
suddenly
disappeared
i
have
got
disease
i
said
cheerily
xxxiv
getting
the
needle
he
was
a
pale
enthusiastic
young
man
of
the
name
of
simms
and
he
held
forth
to
us
at
great
length
about
his
latest
hobby
now
i
just
show
you
a
little
experiment
he
wound
up
one
that
i
have
never
known
to
fail
first
of
all
i
want
you
to
hide
a
needle
somewhere
while
i
am
out
of
the
room
you
must
stick
it
where
it
can
be
seen
on
a
chair
or
on
the
floor
if
you
like
then
i
shall
come
back
blindfolded
and
find
it
oh
mr
simms
we
all
said
now
which
one
of
you
has
the
strongest
will
we
pushed
jack
forward
jack
is
at
any
rate
a
big
man
very
well
i
shall
want
you
to
take
my
hand
when
i
come
in
and
look
steadily
at
the
needle
concentrate
all
your
thoughts
on
it
i
on
the
other
hand
shall
make
my
mind
a
perfect
blank
then
your
thoughts
will
gradually
pass
into
my
brain
and
i
shall
feel
myself
as
it
were
dragged
in
the
direction
of
the
needle
and
i
shall
feel
myself
as
it
were
dragged
after
you
said
jack
yes
you
must
put
any
strain
on
my
arm
at
all
let
me
go
just
where
i
like
only
me
to
go
in
the
right
direction
now
then
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
put
it
hastily
back
and
said
first
i
shall
want
to
borrow
a
handkerchief
or
something
well
we
blindfolded
him
and
led
him
out
of
the
room
then
muriel
got
a
needle
which
after
some
discussion
was
stuck
into
the
back
of
the
chesterfield
simms
returned
and
took
jack
left
hand
they
stood
there
together
jack
frowning
earnestly
at
the
needle
and
simms
swaying
uncertainly
at
the
knees
suddenly
his
knees
went
in
altogether
and
he
made
a
little
dash
across
the
room
as
though
he
were
taking
cover
jack
lumbered
after
him
instinctively
bending
his
head
too
they
were
brought
up
by
the
piano
which
simms
struck
with
great
force
we
all
laughed
and
jack
apologised
you
told
me
to
let
you
go
where
you
liked
you
know
he
said
yes
yes
said
simms
rather
peevishly
but
you
should
have
willed
me
not
to
hit
the
piano
as
he
spoke
he
tripped
over
a
small
stool
and
flinging
out
an
arm
to
save
himself
swept
two
photograph
frames
off
an
occasional
table
by
jove
said
jack
that
jolly
good
i
saw
you
were
going
to
do
that
and
i
willed
that
the
flower
vase
should
be
spared
i
getting
on
i
think
you
had
better
start
from
the
door
again
i
suggested
then
you
can
get
a
clear
run
they
took
up
their
original
positions
you
must
think
hard
please
said
simms
again
my
mind
is
a
perfect
blank
and
yet
i
can
feel
nothing
coming
jack
made
terrible
faces
at
the
needle
then
without
warning
simms
flopped
on
to
the
floor
at
full
length
pulling
jack
after
him
you
must
mind
if
i
do
that
he
said
getting
up
slowly
no
said
jack
dusting
himself
i
felt
irresistibly
compelled
to
go
down
said
simms
so
did
i
said
jack
the
needle
is
very
often
hidden
in
the
floor
you
see
you
are
sure
you
are
looking
at
it
they
were
in
a
corner
with
their
back
to
it
and
jack
after
trying
in
vain
to
get
it
over
his
right
shoulder
or
his
left
bent
down
and
focussed
it
between
his
legs
this
must
have
connected
the
current
for
simms
turned
right
round
and
marched
up
to
the
needle
there
he
said
triumphantly
taking
off
the
bandage
we
all
clapped
while
jack
poured
himself
out
a
whisky
simms
turned
to
him
you
have
a
very
strong
will
indeed
he
said
one
of
the
strongest
i
have
met
now
would
one
of
the
ladies
like
to
try
oh
i
sure
i
could
said
all
the
ladies
i
should
like
to
do
it
again
said
simms
modestly
perhaps
you
sir
all
right
i
try
i
said
when
simms
was
outside
i
told
them
my
idea
i
hold
the
needle
in
my
other
hand
i
said
and
then
i
can
always
look
at
it
easily
and
it
will
always
be
in
a
different
place
which
ought
to
muddle
him
we
fetched
him
in
and
he
took
my
left
hand
no
it
no
good
he
said
at
last
i
do
seem
to
get
it
let
me
try
the
other
hand
i
had
no
time
to
warn
him
he
clasped
the
other
hand
firmly
and
from
the
shriek
that
followed
it
seemed
that
he
got
it
there
ensued
the
perfect
blank
that
he
had
insisted
on
all
the
evening
then
he
pulled
off
the
bandage
and
showed
a
very
angry
face
well
we
explained
how
accidental
it
was
and
begged
him
to
try
again
he
refused
rather
sulkily
suddenly
jack
said
i
believe
i
could
do
it
blindfolded
miss
muriel
will
you
look
at
the
needle
and
see
if
you
can
will
me
simms
bucked
up
a
bit
and
seemed
keen
on
the
idea
so
jack
was
blindfolded
the
needle
hid
and
muriel
took
his
hand
now
is
your
mind
a
perfect
blank
said
simms
to
jack
it
always
is
said
jack
very
well
then
you
ought
soon
to
feel
in
a
dreamy
state
as
though
you
were
in
another
world
miss
muriel
you
must
think
only
of
the
needle
jack
held
her
hand
tight
and
looked
most
idiotically
peaceful
after
three
minutes
simms
spoke
again
well
he
said
eagerly
i
got
the
dreamy
state
perfectly
said
jack
and
then
he
gave
at
the
knees
just
for
the
look
of
the
thing
this
is
silly
said
muriel
trying
to
get
her
hand
away
jack
staggered
violently
and
gripped
her
hand
again
please
miss
muriel
implored
simms
i
feel
sure
he
is
just
going
to
do
it
jack
staggered
again
sawed
the
air
with
his
disengaged
hand
and
then
turned
right
round
and
marched
for
the
door
dragging
muriel
behind
him
the
door
slammed
after
them
there
is
a
little
trick
of
sitting
on
a
chair
and
picking
a
pin
out
of
it
with
the
teeth
i
started
simms
who
was
all
eagerness
to
follow
the
pair
and
find
out
the
mysterious
force
that
was
drawing
them
upon
this
trick
for
jack
is
one
of
my
best
friends
when
jack
and
muriel
came
back
from
the
and
announced
that
they
were
engaged
simms
was
on
his
back
on
the
floor
with
the
chair
on
the
top
of
him
explaining
for
the
fourth
time
that
if
the
thing
had
not
overbalanced
at
the
critical
moment
he
would
have
secured
the
object
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
this
view
xxxv
dressing
up
then
you
really
are
coming
said
queen
elizabeth
yes
i
really
am
i
sighed
what
as
i
do
know
at
all
something
with
a
cold
i
leave
it
to
you
partner
only
do
go
a
black
suit
what
about
richelieu
i
should
never
be
able
to
pronounce
that
i
confessed
besides
i
always
think
that
these
great
scientists
i
should
say
philos
that
is
of
course
that
these
generals
er
which
room
is
the
encyclopedia
in
you
might
go
as
one
of
the
kings
of
england
which
is
your
favourite
king
william
and
mary
now
that
would
be
an
original
costume
i
should
have
do
be
ridiculous
why
not
henry
viii
do
you
think
i
should
get
a
lot
of
partners
as
henry
viii
anyhow
i
do
think
it
a
very
becoming
figure
but
you
do
wear
fancy
dress
simply
because
it
becoming
well
that
is
rather
the
point
to
settle
are
we
going
to
enhance
my
natural
beauty
or
would
you
like
it
er
toned
down
a
little
of
course
i
could
go
as
the
man
only
very
well
then
if
you
do
like
henry
what
about
edward
i
but
why
do
you
want
to
thrust
royalty
on
me
i
much
sooner
go
as
perkin
warbeck
i
should
wear
a
brown
perkin
i
mean
jerkin
jack
is
going
as
sir
walter
raleigh
then
i
shall
certainly
touch
him
for
a
cigarette
i
said
as
i
got
up
to
go
it
was
a
week
later
that
i
met
elizabeth
in
regent
street
well
she
said
have
you
got
your
things
i
have
i
confessed
i
forgot
who
you
said
you
were
going
as
somebody
who
had
black
hair
i
said
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
should
have
knocked
them
rather
if
i
had
had
black
hair
instead
of
curly
eyes
and
blue
hair
can
you
think
of
anybody
for
me
queen
elizabeth
regarded
me
as
sternly
as
she
might
have
regarded
well
i
not
very
good
at
history
do
you
mean
to
say
she
said
at
last
that
that
is
as
far
as
you
have
got
somebody
who
had
black
hair
hang
it
i
protested
it
something
to
have
been
measured
for
the
wig
have
you
been
measured
for
your
wig
well
er
no
that
is
to
say
not
exactly
what
you
might
call
measured
but
well
the
fact
is
that
i
was
just
going
along
now
only
i
say
where
do
i
get
a
wig
you
done
nothing
said
elizabeth
absolutely
nothing
i
say
do
say
that
i
began
nervously
i
done
an
awful
lot
really
i
practically
got
the
costume
i
going
as
harold
the
boy
earl
or
jessica
last
hallo
there
my
bus
i
got
a
cold
i
must
keep
it
waiting
and
i
fled
i
am
going
i
said
as
julius
cæsar
he
was
practically
bald
think
how
cool
that
will
be
do
you
mean
to
say
cried
elizabeth
that
you
have
altered
again
do
be
rough
with
me
or
i
shall
cry
i
got
an
awful
cold
then
you
no
business
to
go
as
julius
cæsar
i
say
now
you
trying
to
unsettle
me
and
i
was
going
to
order
the
clothes
what
you
have
i
was
really
going
this
afternoon
only
only
it
early
closing
day
besides
i
wanted
to
see
if
my
cold
would
get
better
because
if
it
did
look
here
i
be
frank
with
you
i
am
going
as
charlemagne
oh
charlemagne
in
because
pepin
the
short
had
just
died
something
quiet
in
grey
with
a
stripe
i
thought
only
because
he
only
got
half
the
throne
i
suppose
all
these
people
wore
pumps
and
white
kid
gloves
all
right
yes
i
thought
so
i
wonder
if
charlemagne
really
had
black
hair
anyhow
they
ca
prove
he
did
seeing
when
he
lived
he
flourished
about
you
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
actually
his
most
flourishing
year
because
the
radicals
were
in
power
then
and
land
went
down
so
now
yes
or
else
as
winston
churchill
anyhow
i
added
indignantly
a
minute
later
i
swear
i
going
somehow
hallo
i
said
cheerfully
as
i
ran
into
her
majesty
in
piccadilly
i
just
been
ordering
that
is
to
say
i
been
going
i
mean
just
going
to
let
see
it
next
week
is
it
for
a
moment
elizabeth
was
speechless
not
at
all
my
idea
of
the
character
now
then
she
said
at
last
i
am
going
to
take
you
in
hand
will
you
trust
yourself
entirely
to
me
to
the
death
your
majesty
i
sickening
for
something
as
it
is
how
tall
are
you
oh
more
than
that
i
said
quickly
gents
large
medium
i
am
then
i
order
a
costume
for
you
and
have
it
sent
round
there
no
need
for
you
to
be
anything
historical
you
might
be
a
butcher
quite
blue
is
my
colour
in
fact
i
can
do
you
the
best
end
of
the
neck
at
tenpence
madam
if
you
wait
a
moment
while
i
sharpen
the
knife
let
see
you
like
it
cut
on
the
cross
i
think
bother
they
forgotten
the
strop
well
it
may
not
be
a
butcher
said
elizabeth
it
depends
what
they
got
that
was
a
week
ago
this
morning
i
was
really
ill
at
last
had
hardly
any
breakfast
simply
could
look
a
poached
in
the
yolk
a
day
on
the
sofa
in
a
darkened
room
and
bed
at
seven
was
my
programme
and
then
my
eye
caught
a
great
box
of
clothes
and
i
remembered
that
the
dance
was
i
opened
the
box
perhaps
dressed
soberly
as
a
butcher
i
could
look
in
for
an
hour
or
two
and
help
a
yellow
waistcoat
pink
breeches
and
no
it
not
an
a
coat
a
yellow
pink
br
i
am
going
as
joseph
i
am
going
as
a
humming
bird
i
am
going
yes
that
it
i
am
going
back
to
bed
xxxvi
the
complete
kitchen
i
sat
in
the
after
dinner
with
my
knees
together
and
my
hands
in
my
lap
and
waited
for
the
game
to
be
explained
to
me
there
a
pencil
for
you
said
somebody
thank
you
very
much
i
said
and
put
it
carefully
away
evidently
i
had
won
a
forfeit
already
it
was
a
very
good
pencil
though
now
has
everybody
got
pencils
asked
somebody
else
the
game
is
called
a
kitchen
it
quite
easy
will
somebody
think
of
a
letter
she
turned
to
me
perhaps
better
certainly
i
said
and
i
immediately
thought
very
hard
of
these
games
are
called
different
things
but
they
are
all
the
same
really
and
i
do
believe
in
any
of
them
well
said
everybody
what
yes
i
have
go
on
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
in
confusion
i
thought
you
n
is
the
letter
n
or
m
i
smiled
knowingly
to
myself
my
godfather
and
my
godmother
i
went
on
cautiously
it
was
n
interrupted
somebody
now
then
you
got
five
minutes
in
which
to
write
down
everything
you
can
beginning
with
n
go
and
they
all
started
to
write
like
anything
i
took
my
pencil
out
and
began
to
think
i
know
it
sounds
an
easy
game
to
you
now
as
you
sit
at
your
desk
surrounded
by
dictionaries
but
when
you
are
squeezed
on
to
the
edge
of
a
sofa
given
a
very
blunt
pencil
and
a
thin
piece
of
paper
and
challenged
to
write
in
five
minutes
on
your
knees
all
the
words
you
can
think
of
beginning
with
a
certain
letter
well
it
is
another
matter
altogether
i
thought
of
no
end
of
things
which
started
with
k
or
even
l
i
thought
of
rhinoceros
which
is
a
very
long
word
and
starts
with
r
but
as
for
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
groaned
one
minute
gone
i
must
keep
calm
i
said
and
in
a
bold
hand
i
wrote
then
after
a
moment
thought
i
added
and
this
is
splendid
i
told
myself
nobody
and
that
makes
six
at
six
i
stuck
for
two
minutes
i
did
worse
than
that
in
fact
for
i
suddenly
remembered
that
gnats
were
spelt
with
a
however
i
decided
to
leave
them
in
case
nobody
else
remembered
and
on
the
fourth
minute
i
added
time
said
somebody
just
a
moment
said
everybody
they
wrote
down
another
word
or
two
which
is
fair
and
then
began
to
add
up
i
got
thirty
said
one
good
heavens
i
said
i
only
got
seven
there
was
a
shout
of
laughter
then
you
better
begin
said
somebody
read
them
out
i
coughed
nervously
and
began
napoleon
there
was
another
shout
of
laughter
i
am
afraid
we
ca
allow
that
why
ever
not
i
asked
in
amazement
well
you
hardly
find
him
in
a
kitchen
would
you
i
took
out
a
handkerchief
and
wiped
my
brow
i
do
want
to
find
him
in
a
kitchen
i
said
nervously
why
should
i
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
dead
i
do
see
what
the
kitchen
got
to
do
with
it
kitchens
begin
with
a
but
the
game
is
called
a
kitchen
you
have
to
make
a
list
of
things
beginning
with
n
which
you
would
find
in
a
kitchen
you
understood
that
did
you
i
said
oh
of
course
so
napoleon
i
pulled
myself
together
with
a
great
effort
you
do
understand
i
said
with
dignity
the
cook
name
was
napoleon
cooks
are
called
napoleon
said
everybody
this
one
was
carrie
napoleon
her
mistress
was
just
as
surprised
at
first
as
you
were
but
carrie
assured
her
that
no
i
afraid
we
ca
allow
it
i
sorry
i
said
i
wrong
about
that
her
name
was
carrie
smith
but
her
young
man
was
a
soldier
and
she
had
bought
a
life
of
napoleon
for
a
birthday
present
for
him
it
stood
on
the
dresser
waiting
for
her
next
sunday
out
oh
oh
well
i
suppose
that
is
possible
go
on
gnats
i
went
on
nervously
and
hastily
of
course
i
know
that
gnats
are
spelt
with
a
g
they
shrieked
these
were
they
had
lost
the
g
when
they
were
quite
young
and
consequently
could
bite
at
all
and
cook
said
that
no
i
afraid
not
i
sorry
i
said
resignedly
i
had
about
forty
of
them
on
the
dresser
if
you
wo
allow
any
of
them
it
pulls
me
down
a
lot
er
then
we
have
there
was
another
howl
of
derision
not
at
all
i
said
haughtily
cook
had
chapped
hands
very
badly
and
she
went
to
the
chemist
one
evening
for
a
little
glycerine
the
chemist
was
out
and
his
assistant
a
very
nervous
young
fellow
gave
her
by
mistake
it
stood
on
the
dresser
it
did
really
well
said
everybody
very
reluctantly
i
suppose
i
went
on
hastily
that
two
then
nobody
of
course
you
might
easily
find
nobody
in
the
kitchen
in
fact
you
would
pretty
often
i
should
say
three
the
next
is
noon
it
could
be
noon
in
the
kitchen
as
well
as
anywhere
else
be
about
that
all
right
go
on
i
said
doubtfully
what
on
earth
it
a
little
difficult
to
explain
but
the
idea
is
this
at
most
restaurants
you
can
get
a
second
help
of
anything
for
and
that
is
technically
called
a
now
if
they
did
give
you
a
follow
that
would
be
a
you
do
see
that
do
you
there
was
a
deadly
silence
five
i
said
cheerfully
the
last
is
nottingham
i
must
confess
i
added
magnanimously
that
i
am
a
bit
doubtful
whether
you
would
actually
find
nottingham
in
a
kitchen
you
do
say
so
yes
my
feeling
is
that
you
would
be
more
likely
to
find
the
kitchen
in
nottingham
on
the
other
hand
it
is
just
possible
that
as
calais
was
found
engraven
on
mary
heart
so
oh
very
well
then
it
remains
at
five
of
course
you
think
that
as
i
only
had
five
i
came
out
last
but
you
are
wrong
there
is
a
pleasing
rule
in
this
game
that
if
you
have
any
word
in
your
list
which
somebody
else
has
you
can
not
count
it
and
as
all
the
others
had
the
obvious
things
such
as
a
or
a
neck
of
mutton
or
a
nomlette
my
five
won
easily
and
you
will
note
that
if
only
i
had
been
allowed
to
count
my
gnats
it
would
have
been
xxxvii
an
informal
evening
dinner
was
a
very
quiet
affair
not
a
soul
drew
my
chair
away
from
under
me
as
i
sat
down
and
during
the
meal
nobody
threw
bread
about
we
talked
gently
of
art
and
politics
and
things
and
when
the
ladies
left
there
was
no
booby
trap
waiting
for
them
at
the
door
in
a
word
nothing
to
prepare
me
for
what
was
to
follow
we
strolled
leisurely
into
the
a
glance
told
me
the
worst
the
ladies
were
in
a
cluster
round
miss
power
and
miss
power
was
on
the
floor
she
got
up
quickly
as
we
came
in
we
were
trying
to
go
underneath
the
poker
she
explained
can
you
do
it
i
waved
the
poker
back
let
me
see
you
do
it
again
i
said
i
missed
the
first
part
oh
i
can
never
do
it
bob
you
show
us
bob
is
an
active
young
fellow
he
took
the
poker
rested
the
end
on
the
floor
and
then
twisted
himself
underneath
his
right
arm
i
expected
to
see
him
come
up
inside
out
but
he
looked
much
the
same
after
it
however
no
doubt
his
organs
are
all
on
the
wrong
side
now
yes
that
how
i
should
do
it
i
said
hastily
but
miss
power
was
firm
she
gave
me
the
poker
i
pressed
it
hard
on
the
floor
said
to
them
all
and
dived
i
got
round
and
was
supporting
myself
upside
down
by
one
toe
and
the
slippery
end
of
the
poker
when
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
the
earth
was
revolving
at
an
incredible
speed
on
its
own
axis
and
that
in
addition
we
were
hurtling
at
thousands
of
miles
a
minute
round
the
sun
it
seemed
impossible
in
these
circumstances
that
i
should
keep
my
balance
any
longer
and
as
soon
as
i
realised
this
the
poker
began
to
slip
i
was
in
no
sort
of
position
to
do
anything
about
it
and
we
came
down
heavily
together
oh
what
a
pity
said
miss
power
i
quite
thought
you
done
it
being
actually
on
the
spot
i
said
i
knew
that
i
had
do
try
again
not
till
the
ground
a
little
softer
let
do
the
trick
said
another
girl
i
not
going
under
a
for
anybody
i
murmured
however
it
turned
out
that
this
trick
was
quite
different
you
place
a
book
macaulay
or
what
not
on
the
and
sit
on
the
book
one
heel
only
touching
the
ground
in
the
right
hand
you
have
a
box
of
matches
in
the
left
a
candle
the
of
course
is
on
its
side
so
that
it
can
roll
beneath
you
then
you
light
the
candle
and
hand
it
to
anybody
who
wants
to
go
to
bed
i
was
ready
to
give
way
to
the
ladies
here
but
even
while
i
was
bowing
and
saying
not
at
all
i
found
myself
on
one
of
the
with
bob
next
to
me
on
another
to
balance
with
the
arms
outstretched
was
not
so
difficult
but
as
the
matches
were
then
about
six
feet
from
the
candle
and
there
seemed
no
way
of
getting
them
nearer
together
the
solution
of
the
problem
was
as
remote
as
ever
three
times
i
brought
my
hands
together
and
three
times
the
left
me
well
played
bob
said
somebody
the
bounder
has
done
it
i
looked
at
his
there
you
are
i
said
mine
a
rotten
vintage
and
look
at
my
book
on
the
and
you
got
mormon
no
wonder
i
could
do
it
i
refused
to
try
it
again
as
i
did
think
i
was
being
treated
fairly
and
after
bob
and
miss
power
had
had
a
race
at
it
which
bob
won
we
got
on
to
something
else
of
course
you
can
pick
a
pin
out
of
a
chair
with
your
teeth
said
miss
power
not
properly
i
said
i
always
swallow
the
pin
i
suppose
it
does
count
if
you
swallow
the
pin
said
miss
power
thoughtfully
i
do
know
i
never
really
thought
about
that
side
of
it
much
anyhow
unless
you
got
a
whole
lot
of
pins
you
do
want
do
ask
me
to
do
it
accordingly
we
passed
on
to
the
i
refused
at
this
but
miss
power
went
full
length
on
the
floor
with
a
glass
of
water
balanced
on
her
forehead
and
came
up
again
without
spilling
a
single
drop
personally
i
should
have
minded
spilling
a
single
drop
it
was
the
thought
of
spilling
the
whole
glass
that
kept
me
back
anyway
it
is
a
useless
trick
the
need
for
which
never
arises
in
an
ordinary
career
picking
up
with
the
teeth
while
clasping
the
left
ankle
with
the
right
hand
is
another
matter
that
might
come
in
useful
on
occasions
as
for
instance
if
having
lost
your
left
arm
on
the
field
and
having
to
staunch
with
the
right
hand
the
flow
of
blood
from
a
bullet
wound
in
the
opposite
ankle
you
desired
to
glance
through
the
financial
supplement
while
waiting
for
the
ambulance
here
a
nice
little
trick
broke
in
bob
as
i
was
preparing
myself
in
this
way
for
the
german
invasion
he
had
put
two
chairs
together
front
to
front
and
was
standing
over
them
if
that
conveys
it
to
you
then
he
jumped
up
turned
round
in
the
air
and
came
down
facing
the
other
way
can
do
it
i
said
to
miss
power
come
and
try
said
bob
to
me
it
not
really
difficult
i
went
and
stood
over
the
chairs
then
i
moved
them
apart
and
walked
over
to
my
hostess
i
said
i
afraid
i
must
go
now
coward
said
somebody
who
knew
me
rather
better
than
the
others
it
much
easier
than
you
think
said
bob
i
do
think
it
easy
at
all
i
protested
i
think
impossible
i
went
back
and
stood
over
the
chairs
again
for
some
time
i
waited
there
in
deep
thought
then
i
bent
my
knees
preparatory
to
the
spring
straightened
them
up
and
said
what
happens
if
you
just
miss
it
i
suppose
you
bark
your
shins
a
bit
yes
that
what
i
thought
i
bent
my
knees
again
worked
my
arms
up
and
down
and
then
stopped
suddenly
and
said
what
happens
if
you
miss
it
pretty
easily
oh
can
do
it
if
bob
can
said
miss
power
kindly
he
practised
i
expect
he
started
with
two
hassocks
and
worked
up
to
this
i
not
afraid
but
i
want
to
know
the
possibilities
if
it
only
a
broken
leg
or
two
i
do
mind
if
it
permanent
disfigurement
i
think
i
ought
to
consult
my
family
first
i
jumped
up
and
came
down
again
the
same
way
for
practice
very
well
i
said
now
i
going
to
try
i
have
the
faintest
hope
of
doing
it
but
you
all
seem
to
want
to
see
an
accident
and
anyhow
i
not
going
to
be
called
a
coward
one
two
three
well
done
cried
everybody
did
i
do
it
i
whispered
as
i
sat
on
the
floor
and
pressed
a
cushion
against
my
shins
rather
then
i
said
massaging
my
ankles
next
time
i
shall
try
to
miss
xxxviii
a
billiard
lesson
i
was
showing
celia
a
few
fancy
strokes
on
the
billiard
table
the
other
members
of
the
were
in
the
library
learning
their
parts
for
some
approaching
theatricals
that
is
to
say
they
were
sitting
round
the
fire
and
saying
to
each
other
this
a
rotten
play
we
had
been
offered
the
position
of
auditors
to
several
of
the
company
but
we
were
going
to
see
on
the
next
day
and
i
was
afraid
that
the
constant
excitement
would
be
bad
for
celia
why
do
you
ask
me
to
play
with
you
she
asked
you
never
teach
me
anything
there
ingratitude
why
i
gave
you
your
first
lesson
at
golf
only
last
thursday
so
you
did
i
know
golf
now
show
me
billiards
i
looked
at
my
watch
we
only
twenty
minutes
i
play
you
thirty
up
what
do
you
give
me
a
ball
or
a
bisque
or
what
i
ca
spare
you
a
ball
i
afraid
i
shall
want
all
three
when
i
get
going
you
may
have
fifteen
start
and
i
tell
you
what
to
do
well
what
do
i
do
first
select
a
cue
she
went
over
to
the
rack
and
inspected
them
this
seems
a
nice
brown
one
now
then
you
begin
celia
you
got
the
put
it
back
and
take
a
younger
one
i
thought
it
seemed
taller
than
the
others
she
took
another
this
good
then
off
you
go
will
you
be
spot
or
plain
i
said
chalking
my
cue
does
it
matter
not
very
much
they
both
the
same
shape
then
what
the
difference
well
one
is
more
spotted
than
the
other
then
i
be
less
spotted
i
went
to
the
table
i
think
i
said
i
try
and
screw
in
off
the
red
i
did
this
once
by
accident
and
i
always
wanted
to
do
it
again
or
perhaps
i
corrected
myself
as
soon
as
the
ball
had
left
me
i
had
better
give
a
safety
miss
i
did
my
ball
avoided
the
red
and
came
swiftly
back
into
the
bottom
pocket
that
three
to
you
i
said
without
enthusiasm
celia
seemed
surprised
but
i
have
begun
yet
she
said
well
i
suppose
you
know
the
rules
but
it
seems
funny
what
would
you
like
me
to
do
well
there
is
much
on
you
better
just
try
and
hit
the
red
ball
right
she
leant
over
the
table
and
took
long
and
careful
aim
i
held
my
breath
still
she
aimed
then
keeping
her
chin
on
the
cue
she
slowly
turned
her
head
and
looked
up
at
me
with
a
thoughtful
expression
ought
there
to
be
three
balls
on
the
table
she
said
wrinkling
her
forehead
no
i
answered
shortly
but
why
not
because
i
went
down
by
mistake
but
you
said
that
when
you
got
going
you
wanted
i
ca
argue
bending
down
like
this
she
raised
herself
slowly
you
said
oh
all
right
i
expect
you
know
anyhow
i
have
scored
some
already
i
yes
you
eighteen
to
my
nothing
yes
well
now
i
shall
have
to
aim
all
over
again
she
bent
slowly
over
her
cue
does
it
matter
where
i
hit
the
red
not
much
as
long
as
you
hit
it
on
the
red
part
she
hit
it
hard
on
the
side
and
both
balls
came
into
baulk
too
good
i
said
does
either
of
us
get
anything
for
it
no
the
red
and
white
were
close
together
and
i
went
up
the
table
and
down
again
on
the
of
a
cannon
i
misjudged
it
however
that
three
to
you
i
said
stiffly
as
i
took
my
ball
out
of
the
bottom
pocket
to
nothing
funny
how
i
doing
all
the
scoring
said
celia
meditatively
and
i
practically
never
played
before
i
shall
hit
the
red
hard
now
and
see
what
happens
to
it
she
hit
and
the
red
coursed
madly
about
the
table
coming
to
rest
near
the
top
pocket
and
close
to
the
cushion
with
a
forcing
shot
i
could
get
in
this
will
want
a
lot
of
chalk
i
said
pleasantly
to
celia
and
gave
it
plenty
then
i
let
fly
why
did
that
want
a
lot
of
chalk
said
celia
with
interest
i
went
to
the
fireplace
and
picked
my
ball
out
of
the
fender
that
three
to
you
i
said
coldly
to
nothing
am
i
winning
you
leading
i
explained
only
you
see
i
may
make
a
twenty
at
any
moment
oh
she
thought
this
over
well
i
may
make
my
three
at
any
moment
she
chalked
her
cue
and
went
over
to
her
ball
what
shall
i
do
just
touch
the
red
on
the
side
i
said
and
you
go
into
the
pocket
the
side
do
you
mean
my
side
or
the
ball
the
side
of
the
ball
of
course
that
is
to
say
the
side
opposite
your
but
its
side
is
opposite
my
left
hand
if
the
ball
is
facing
this
way
take
it
i
said
wearily
that
the
ball
has
its
back
to
you
how
rude
of
it
said
celia
and
hit
it
on
the
side
and
sank
it
was
that
what
you
meant
well
it
another
way
of
doing
it
i
thought
it
was
what
do
i
give
you
for
that
you
get
three
oh
i
thought
the
other
person
always
got
the
marks
i
know
the
last
three
times
go
on
i
said
freezingly
you
have
another
turn
oh
is
it
like
rounders
something
go
on
there
a
dear
it
getting
late
she
went
and
left
the
red
over
the
middle
pocket
i
said
i
found
a
nice
place
in
the
d
for
my
ball
now
then
this
is
the
grey
stroke
you
know
i
suppose
i
was
nervous
anyhow
i
just
nicked
the
red
ball
gently
on
the
wrong
side
and
left
it
hanging
over
the
pocket
the
white
travelled
slowly
up
the
table
why
is
that
called
the
grey
stroke
asked
celia
with
great
interest
because
once
when
sir
edward
grey
was
playing
the
german
ambassador
but
it
rather
a
long
story
i
tell
you
another
time
oh
well
anyhow
did
the
german
ambassador
get
anything
for
it
no
then
i
suppose
i
do
bother
but
you
only
got
to
knock
the
red
in
for
game
oh
there
what
that
that
a
miscue
i
get
one
oh
oh
well
she
added
magnanimously
i
glad
you
started
scoring
it
will
make
it
more
interesting
for
you
there
was
just
room
to
creep
in
off
the
red
leaving
it
still
over
the
pocket
with
celia
ball
nicely
over
the
other
pocket
there
was
a
chance
of
my
twenty
break
let
see
i
said
how
many
do
i
want
replied
celia
ah
i
said
and
i
crept
in
that
three
to
you
i
said
icily
game
xxxix
bachelor
relics
do
you
happen
to
want
i
said
to
henry
an
opera
hat
that
does
op
at
least
it
only
works
one
side
no
said
henry
to
any
one
who
buys
my
opera
hat
for
a
large
sum
i
am
giving
away
four
square
yards
of
linoleum

revolving
bookcase

curtain
rods
a
pair
of
and
an
extremely
patent

said
henry
again
the
i
pleaded
is
unused
that
is
to
say
no
mouse
has
used
it
yet
my
has
never
been
blooded
i
do
want
it
myself
said
henry
but
i
know
a
man
who
does
henry
you
know
everybody
for
heaven
sake
introduce
me
to
your
friend
why
does
he
particularly
want
a
he
does
he
wants
anything
that
old
old
clothes
old
carpets
anything
that
old
he
buy
he
seemed
to
be
exactly
the
man
i
wanted
introduce
me
to
your
fellow
clubman
i
said
firmly
that
evening
i
wrote
to
henry
friend
bennett
dear
sir
i
wrote
if
you
would
call
upon
me
i
should
like
to
show
you
some
really
old
things
all
genuine
antiques
in
particular
i
would
call
your
attention
to
an
old
opera
hat
of
exquisite
workmanship
and
a
of
chaste
and
handsome
design
i
have
also
a
few
yards
of
queen
anne
linoleum
of
a
circular
pattern
which
i
think
will
please
you
my
james
the
first
and
louis
quatorze
are
well
known
to
connoisseurs
a
genuine
old
cork
bedroom
suite
comprising
one
will
also
be
included
in
the
sale
yours
faithfully
on
second
thoughts
i
tore
the
letter
up
and
sent
bennett
a
postcard
asking
him
to
favour
the
undersigned
with
a
call
at
prompt
and
at
prompt
he
came
i
had
expected
to
see
a
bearded
patriarch
with
a
hooked
nose
and
three
hats
on
his
head
but
bennett
turned
out
to
be
a
very
spruce
gentleman
wearing
i
was
sorry
to
see
much
better
clothes
than
the
opera
hat
i
proposed
to
sell
him
he
became
businesslike
at
once
just
tell
me
what
you
want
to
sell
he
said
whipping
out
a
and
i
make
a
note
of
it
i
take
anything
i
looked
round
my
spacious
apartment
and
wondered
what
to
begin
with
the
revolving
bookcase
i
announced
i
afraid
there
very
little
sale
for
revolving
bookcases
now
he
said
as
he
made
a
note
of
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
pointed
out
this
one
does
revolve
it
got
stuck
some
years
ago
he
did
seem
to
think
that
this
would
increase
the
rush
but
he
made
a
note
of
it
then
the
the
what
the
georgian
bureau
a
copy
of
an
old
escritoire
walnut
he
said
tapping
it
possibly
the
value
of
this
georgian
however
lies
not
in
the
wood
but
in
the
literary
associations
ah
my
customers
do
bother
much
about
that
but
still
whose
was
it
mine
i
said
with
dignity
placing
my
hand
in
the
breast
pocket
of
my
coat
i
have
written
many
charming
things
at
that
desk
my
to
a
my
on
asia
my
anything
else
in
this
room
said
bennett
carpets
curtains
nothing
else
i
said
coldly
we
went
into
the
bedroom
and
gazing
on
the
linoleum
my
enthusiasm
returned
to
me
the
linoleum
i
said
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
very
much
worn
said
bennett
i
called
his
attention
to
the
piece
under
the
bed
not
under
there
i
said
i
never
walk
on
that
piece
it
as
good
as
new
he
made
a
note
what
else
he
said
i
showed
him
round
the
collection
he
saw
the
louis
quatorze
the
cork
bedroom
suite
the
cæsarian
quite
bald
the
antique
with
genuine
crack
he
saw
it
all
and
then
we
went
back
into
the
other
rooms
and
found
some
more
things
for
him
yes
he
said
consulting
his
notebook
and
now
how
would
you
like
me
to
buy
these
at
a
large
price
i
said
if
you
have
brought
your
lend
you
a
pen
you
want
me
to
make
you
an
offer
otherwise
i
should
sell
them
by
auction
for
you
deducting
ten
per
cent
commission
not
by
auction
i
said
impulsively
i
could
bear
to
know
how
much
or
rather
how
little
my
georgian
bureau
fetched
it
was
there
as
i
think
i
told
you
that
i
wrote
my
to
the
round
pond
give
me
an
inclusive
price
for
the
lot
and
never
never
let
me
know
the
details
he
named
an
inclusive
price
it
was
something
under
a
pounds
i
should
have
minded
that
if
it
had
only
been
a
little
over
ten
pounds
but
it
was
right
i
agreed
and
oh
i
was
nearly
forgetting
there
an
old
opera
hat
of
exquisite
workmanship
which
ah
now
clothes
had
much
better
be
sold
by
auction
make
a
pile
of
all
you
do
want
and
i
send
round
a
sack
for
them
i
have
an
auction
sale
every
wednesday
very
well
send
round
and
you
might
er
also
send
round
a
er
cheque
for
quite
so
well
then
good
morning
when
he
had
gone
i
went
into
my
bedroom
and
made
a
pile
of
my
it
did
look
very
impressive
hardly
worth
having
a
sack
specially
sent
round
for
it
to
keep
it
company
i
collected
an
assortment
of
clothes
it
pained
me
to
break
up
my
wardrobe
in
this
way
but
i
wanted
the
bidding
for
my
to
be
brisk
and
a
few
preliminary
suits
would
warm
the
public
up
altogether
it
was
a
goodly
pile
when
it
was
done
the
perched
on
the
top
half
of
it
only
at
work
i
received
from
bennett
a
cheque
a
catalogue
and
an
account
the
catalogue
was
marked
lots
somehow
i
felt
that
my
opera
hat
would
be
lot
i
turned
to
it
in
the
account
six
it
did
well
i
said
perhaps
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
hoped
for
seven
and
sixpence
but
six
shillings
yes
it
was
a
good
hat
and
then
i
turned
to
the
catalogue
frock
coat

you
remember
that
evening
at
christ
church
college
five
years
ago
when
we
opened
our
hearts
to
each

cigar
and
hiding
it
in
a
that
moonlight
evening
on
the
backs

promised
that
when
either
of
us
fell
in

should
be
the
first
to
hear
of

grip
of
the

and
returns
to

cares
to
thank
you

a
typically
british
desire
to
conceal

lucky
little
lady

of
the
british
museum
and
kissing
it
isobel

henry
not
careful
he
will
probably
give
a
start
of
surprise
here
with
the
idea
of
suggesting
to
the
audience
that
something
about
the
lady
past
in
love
with
her
himself
he
is
however
thinking
of
a
different
play
we
shall
come
to
that
one
in
a
a
slightly
dashing
little
isobel
lucky
dog
i
wish
i
could
think
so
but
i
have

to
approach
her

she
may
be
another

she
should
be
another

puts
his
rifle
down
carefully
on

up

were
engaged
realising
how
the
dreadful
misunderstanding
arose
which
nearly
wrecked

but
i
only
meant
i
was
engaged
to

her
in
his
never
darling
that
was
only
to
the
audience
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
making
his
best
slight
curtain
xlii
miss
prendergast
the
curtain
goes
up
two
ladies
are
discovered
in
the
of
honeysuckle
lodge
engaged
in
work
of
a
feminine
miss
alice
prendergast
doing
something
delicate
with
a
but
it
is
obvious
that
her
thoughts
are
far
away
she
sighs
at
intervals
and
occasionally
lays
down
her
work
and
presses
both
hands
to
her
heart
a
sympathetic
audience
will
have
no
difficulty
in
guessing
that
she
is
in
love
on
the
other
hand
her
elder
miss
prendergast
completely
wrapped
up
in
a
sock
for
one
of
the
poorer
classes
over
which
she
frowns
formidably
the
sock
however
has
no
real
bearing
upon
the
plot
and
she
must
not
make
too
much
of
her
did
you
have
a
pleasant
last
night
jane
seventeen
eighteen
nineteen
twenty
very
pleasant
indeed
alice
the
blizzards
were
there
and
the
podbys
and
the
slumphs
people
are
not
important
and
should
not
be
podby
maid
has
given
notice
who
took
you
in
such
an
interesting
man
my
dear
he
talked
most
agreeably
about
art
during
dinner
and
we
renewed
the
conversation
in
the
we
found
that
we
agreed
upon
all
the
main
principles
of
art
considered
as
such
a
look
in
her
eyes
which
shows
that
she
is
recalling
a
tender
when
i
was
in
shropshire
last
week
what
was
your
man
name
a
warning
glance
at
the
you
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
catch
names
when
one
is
introduced
i
am
certain
he
never
heard
mine
the
plot
depends
partly
upon
this
she
pauses
for
it
to
sink
but
i
enquired
about
him
afterwards
and
i
find
that
he
is
a
mary
handing
letter
a
letter
for
you
miss
thank
you
mary
mary
work
up
her
next
a
letter
i
wonder
who
it
is
from
the
miss
prendergast
honeysuckle
lodge
opens
it
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
often
received
letters
before
but
feels
that
this
one
may
play
an
important
part
in
her
dear
miss
prendergast
i
hope
you
will
pardon
the
presumption
of
what
i
am
about
to
write
to
you
but
whether
you
pardon
me
or
not
i
ask
you
to
listen
to
me
i
know
of
no
woman
for
whose
talents
i
have
a
greater
admiration
or
for
whose
qualities
i
have
a
more
sincere
affection
than
yourself
since
i
have
known
you
you
have
been
the
lodestar
of
my
existence
the
fountain
of
my
inspiration
i
feel
that
were
your
life
joined
to
mine
the
joint
path
upon
which
we
trod
would
be
the
path
to
happiness
such
as
i
have
as
yet
hardly
dared
to
dream
of
in
short
dear
miss
prendergast
i
ask
you
to
marry
me
and
i
will
come
in
person
for
my
answer
yours

intense
jas
bootle
the
word

a
wave
of
warm
colour
rushes
over
alice
and
dyes
her
from
neck
to
brow
if
she
is
not
an
actress
of
sufficient
calibre
to
ensure
this
she
must
do
the
best
she
can
by
starting
abruptly
and
putting
her
hand
to
her
in
a
choking
bootle
in
love
with
jane
my
dear
the
man
who
took
me
down

they
came
in
anonymously
and
i
thought
they
were
more
likely
to
be
accepted
if
i
said
i
had
written
them
great
forgive
me
chief
but
it
was
for
the
paper
sake
there
were
one
or
two
peculiarities
of
style
i
had
to
alter
she
had
a
way
of
how
many
cheques
for
them
have
you
accepted
for
the
paper
sake
eight
for
a
thousand
pounds
each
tears
in
his
if
your
mother
were
to
hear
of
this
ah
chief
i
never
had
a
mother
put
out
but
recovering
himself
what
would
your
father
say
if
alas
i
have
no
relations
i
was
a
foundling
in
that
case
i
shall
certainly
tell
the
master
of
your
workhouse
to
think
that
there
should
be
a
thief
in
this
office
great
chief
chief
i
am
not
so
vile
as
that
i
have
carefully
kept
all
the
cheques
in
an
old
stocking
and
do
you
wear
stockings
when
i
bicycle
and
as
soon
as
the
contributor
comes
forward
out
his
hand
and
grasping
that
of
my
dear
boy
forgive
me
you
have
been
hasty
perhaps
but
zealous
in
any
case
your
honesty
is
above
suspicion

me
now
i
have
much
to
think
of
his
head
on
his
hands

never
seen

father

the
solicitor
the
office
was
at
its
busiest
for
it
was
friday
afternoon
john
blunt
leant
back
in
his
comfortable
chair
and
toyed
with
the
key
of
the
safe
while
he
tried
to
realise
his
new
position
he
john
blunt
was
junior
partner
in
the
great
london
firm
of
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
he
closed
his
eyes
and
his
thoughts
wandered
back
to
the
day
when
he
had
first
entered
the
doors
of
the
firm
as
one
of
two
hundred
and
applicants
for
the
post
of
they
had
been
interviewed
in
batches
and
old
sanderson
the
senior
partner
had
taken
the
first
batch
i
like
your
face
my
boy
he
had
said
heartily
to
john
and
i
like
yours
replied
john
not
to
be
outdone
in
politeness
now
i
wonder
if
you
can
spell
one
said
john
tentatively
sanderson
was
delighted
with
the
lad
knowledge
and
engaged
him
at
once
for
three
years
john
had
done
his
duty
faithfully
during
this
time
he
had
saved
the
firm
more
than
once
by
his
readiness
particularly
on
one
occasion
when
he
had
called
old
sanderson
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
had
signed
a
letter
to
a
firm
of
stockbrokers
your
loving
husband
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
sanderson
always
a
little
corrected
the
error
and
promised
the
boy
his
articles
five
years
later
john
blunt
was
a
solicitor
and
now
he
was
actually
junior
partner
in
the
firm
the
firm
of
which
it
was
said
in
the
city
if
a
man
has
macnaughton

macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
behind
him
he
is
all
right
the
city
is
always
coining
pithy
little
epigrams
like
this
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
of
the
enquiry
office
and
a
gentleman
came
in
can
i
see
mr
macnaughton
he
said
politely
to
the
there
is
no
macnaughton
replied
the
latter
they
all
died
years
ago
well
well
can
i
see
one
of
the
partners
you
ca
see
sanderson
because
he
having
his
lunch
said
the
boy
thorpe
has
come
back
from

yet
peters

just
gone
out
to
lunch
williams
is
expected
back
from

every
minute
gourlay
went
out
to
lunch
an
hour
ago
beamish
tut
tut
is
anybody
in
blunt
is
in
said
the
boy
and
took
up
the
telephone
if
you
wait
a
moment
i
see
if
he
awake
half
an
hour
later
masters
was
shown
into
john
blunt
room
i
sorry
i
was
engaged
said
john
a
most
important
client
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
er
masters
i
wish
to
make
my
will
by
all
means
said
john
cordially
i
have
only
one
child
to
whom
i
intend
to
leave
all
my
money
ha
said
john
with
a
frown
this
will
be
a
lengthy
and
difficult
business
but
you
can
do
it
asked
masters
anxiously
they
told
me
at
the
hairdresser
that
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
was
the
cleverest
firm
in
london
we
can
do
it
said
john
simply
but
it
will
require
all
our
care
and
i
think
it
would
be
best
if
i
were
to
come
and
stay
with
you
for
the
weekend
we
could
go
into
it
properly
then
thank
you
said
masters
clasping
the
other
hand
i
was
just
going
to
suggest
it
my
is
outside
let
us
go
at
once
i
will
follow
you
in
a
moment
said
john
and
pausing
only
to
snatch
a
handful
of
money
from
the
safe
for
incidental
expenses
and
to
tell
the
boy
that
he
would
be
back
on
monday
he
picked
up
the
bag
which
he
always
kept
ready
and
hurried
after
the
other
inside
the
car
masters
was
confidential
my
daughter
he
said
comes
of
age
oh
it
a
daughter
said
john
in
surprise
is
she
pretty
she
is
considered
to
be
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
county
really
said
john
he
thought
a
moment
and
added
can
we
stop
at
a
i
must
send
an
important
business
telegram
he
took
out
a
form
and
wrote
macmacmacmacmac
london
shall
not
be
back
till
wednesday
blunt
the
car
stopped
and
then
sped
on
again
amy
has
never
been
any
trouble
to
me
said
masters
but
i
am
getting
old
now
and
i
would
give
a
thousand
pounds
to
see
her
happily
married
to
whom
would
you
give
it
asked
john
whipping
out
his
tut
tut
a
mere
figure
of
speech
but
i
would
settle
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
on
her
on
the
indeed
said
john
thoughtfully
can
we
stop
at
another
he
added
bringing
out
his
again
he
took
out
a
second
telegraph
form
and
wrote
macmacmacmacmac
london
shall
not
be
back
till
friday
blunt
the
car
dashed
on
again
and
an
hour
later
arrived
at
a
commodious
mansion
standing
in
its
own
grounds
of
upwards
of
several
acres
at
the
front
door
a
graceful
figure
was
standing
my
solicitor
dear
blunt
said
masters
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
come
all
this
way
on
my
father
business
she
said
shyly
not
at
all
said
john
a
week
or
or
a
fortnight
or
he
looked
at
her
again
or
three
weeks
and
the
thing
is
done
is
making
a
will
so
very
difficult
it
a
very
tricky
and
complicated
affair
indeed
however
i
think
we
shall
pull
it
off
er
might
i
send
an
important
business
telegram
macmacmacmacmac
london
wrote
john
very
knotty
case
date
of
return
uncertain
please
send
more
cash
for
incidental
expenses
blunt
yes
you
have
guessed
what
happened
it
is
an
experience
in
a
solicitor
life
john
blunt
and
amy
masters
were
married
at
george
hanover
square
last
may
the
wedding
was
a
quiet
one
owing
to
mourning
in
the
bride
family
the
result
of
a
too
sudden
perusal
of
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
macnaughton
bill
of
costs
as
masters
said
with
his
expiring
breath
he
did
mind
paying
for
our
blunt
skill
nor
yet
for
our
blunt
valuable
time
even
if
most
of
it
was
spent
in
courting
amy
nor
again
for
our
blunt
tips
to
servants
but
he
did
object
to
being
charged
the
railway
fare
both
ways
when
our
blunt
had
come
down
and
gone
up
again
in
the
car
and
perhaps
i
ought
to
add
that
that
is
the
drawback
to
this
fine
profession
one
is
so
often
misunderstood
xlvii
the
painter
paul
samways
was
in
a
mood
of
deep
depression
the
artistic
temperament
is
peculiarly
given
to
these
moods
but
in
paul
case
there
was
reason
why
he
should
take
a
gloomy
view
of
things
his
masterpiece
the
shot
tower
from
battersea
bridge
together
with
the
companion
picture
battersea
bridge
from
the
shot
tower
had
been
purchased
by
a
dealer
for
seventeen
and
sixpence
his
sepia
monochrome
night
had
brought
him
an
for
five
shillings
these
were
his
sole
earnings
for
the
last
six
weeks
and
starvation
stared
him
in
the
face
if
only
i
had
a
little
capital
he
cried
aloud
in
despair
enough
to
support
me
until
my
academy
picture
is
finished
his
academy
picture
was
a
masterly
study
entitled
roll
on
thou
deep
and
dark
blue
ocean
roll
and
he
had
been
compelled
to
stop
halfway
across
the
channel
through
sheer
lack
of
ultramarine
the
clock
struck
two
reminding
him
that
he
had
not
lunched
he
rose
wearily
and
went
to
the
little
cupboard
which
served
as
a
larder
there
was
but
little
there
to
make
a
satisfying
meal
half
a
loaf
of
bread
a
corner
of
cheese
and
a
small
tube
of
chinese
white
mechanically
he
set
the
things
out
he
had
finished
and
was
clearing
away
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
his
charwoman
whose
duty
it
was
to
clean
his
brushes
every
week
came
in
with
a
card
a
lady
to
see
you
sir
she
said
paul
read
the
card
in
astonishment
the
duchess
of
winchester
he
exclaimed
what
on
earth
show
her
in
please
hastily
picking
up
a
brush
and
the
first
tube
which
came
to
hand
he
placed
himself
in
a
dramatic
position
before
his
easel
and
set
to
work
how
do
you
do
mr
samways
said
the
duchess
afternoon
said
paul
embarrassed
both
by
the
presence
of
a
duchess
in
his
studio
and
by
his
sudden
discovery
that
he
was
touching
up
a
sunset
with
a
tube
of
carbolic
tooth
paste
our
mutual
friend
lord
ernest
topwood
recommended
me
to
come
to
you
paul
who
had
never
met
lord
ernest
but
had
once
seen
his
name
in
a
paper
beneath
a
photograph
of
arnold
bennett
bowed
silently
as
you
probably
guess
i
want
you
to
paint
my
daughter
portrait
paul
opened
his
mouth
to
say
that
he
was
only
a
landscape
painter
and
then
closed
it
again
after
all
it
was
hardly
fair
to
bother
her
grace
with
technicalities
i
hope
you
can
undertake
this
commission
she
said
pleadingly
i
shall
be
delighted
said
paul
i
am
rather
busy
just
now
but
i
could
begin
at
two
on
monday
excellent
said
the
duchess
till
monday
then
and
paul
still
clutching
the
tooth
paste
conducted
her
to
her
carriage
punctually
at
on
monday
lady
hermione
appeared
paul
drew
a
deep
breath
of
astonishment
when
he
saw
her
for
she
was
lovely
beyond
compare
all
his
skill
as
a
landscape
painter
would
be
needed
if
he
were
to
do
justice
to
her
beauty
as
quickly
as
possible
he
placed
her
in
position
and
set
to
work
may
i
let
my
face
go
for
a
moment
said
lady
hermione
after
three
hours
of
it
yes
let
us
stop
said
paul
he
had
outlined
her
in
charcoal
and
burnt
cork
and
it
would
be
too
dark
to
do
any
more
that
evening
tell
me
where
you
first
met
lord
ernest
she
asked
as
she
came
down
to
the
fire
at
the
savoy
in
june
said
paul
boldly
lady
hermione
laughed
merrily
paul
who
had
not
regarded
his
last
remark
as
one
of
his
best
things
looked
at
her
in
surprise
but
your
portrait
of
him
was
in
the
academy
in
may
she
smiled
paul
made
up
his
mind
quickly
lady
hermione
he
said
with
gravity
do
not
speak
to
me
of
lord
ernest
again
nor
he
added
hurriedly
to
lord
ernest
of
me
when
your
picture
is
finished
i
will
tell
you
why
now
it
is
time
you
went
he
woke
the
duchess
up
and
made
a
few
commonplace
remarks
about
the
weather
remember
he
whispered
to
lady
hermione
as
he
saw
them
to
their
car
she
nodded
and
smiled
the
sittings
went
on
daily
sometimes
paul
would
paint
rapidly
with
great
sweeps
of
the
brush
sometimes
he
would
spend
an
hour
trying
to
get
on
his
palette
the
exact
shade
of
green
bice
for
the
famous
winchester
emeralds
sometimes
in
despair
he
would
take
a
sponge
and
wipe
the
whole
picture
out
and
then
start
madly
again
and
sometimes
he
would
stop
work
altogether
and
tell
lady
hermione
about
his
in
worcestershire
but
always
when
he
woke
the
duchess
up
at
the
end
of
the
sitting
he
would
say
remember
and
lady
hermione
would
nod
back
at
him
it
was
a
day
in
march
when
the
picture
was
finished
and
nothing
remained
to
do
but
to
paint
in
the
signature
it
is
beautiful
said
lady
hermione
with
enthusiasm
beautiful
is
it
at
all
like
me
paul
looked
from
her
to
the
picture
and
back
to
her
again
no
he
said
not
a
bit
you
know
i
am
really
a
landscape
painter
what
do
you
mean
she
cried
you
are
peter
samways
the
famous
portrait
painter
no
he
said
sadly
that
was
my
secret
i
am
paul
samways
a
member
of
the
amateur
rowing
association
it
is
true
but
only
an
unknown
landscape
painter
peter
samways
lives
in
the
next
studio
and
he
is
not
even
a
relation
then
you
have
deceived
me
you
have
brought
me
here
under
false
pretences
she
stamped
her
foot
angrily
my
father
will
not
buy
that
picture
and
i
forbid
you
to
exhibit
it
as
a
portrait
of
myself
my
dear
lady
hermione
said
paul
you
need
not
be
alarmed
i
propose
to
exhibit
the
picture
as
the
heart
is
young
nobody
will
recognise
a
likeness
to
you
in
it
and
if
the
duke
does
not
buy
it
i
have
no
doubt
that
some
other
purchaser
will
come
along
lady
hermione
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
why
did
you
do
it
she
asked
gently
because
i
fell
in
love
with
you
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
then
raised
them
gaily
to
his
mother
is
still
asleep
she
whispered
hermione
he
cried
dropping
his
palette
and
putting
his
brush
behind
his
ear
she
held
out
her
arms
to
him
as
everybody
remembers
when
the
heart
is
young
by
paul
samways
was
the
feature
of
the
exhibition
it
was
bought
for
by
a
retired
whom
it
reminded
a
little
of
his
late
mother
paul
woke
to
find
himself
famous
but
the
success
which
began
for
him
from
this
day
did
not
spoil
his
simple
and
generous
nature
he
never
forgot
his
brother
artists
whose
feet
were
not
yet
on
the
top
of
the
ladder
indeed
one
of
his
first
acts
after
he
was
married
was
to
give
a
commission
to
peter
samways
nothing
less
than
the
painting
of
his
wife
portrait
and
lady
hermione
was
delighted
with
the
result
xlviii
the
barrister
the
new
bailey
was
crowded
with
a
gay
and
fashionable
throng
it
was
a
remarkable
case
of
aurora
delaine
was
charged
with
feloniously
stealing
and
conveying
certain
articles
the
property
of
the
universal
stores
to
wit
yards
of
book
muslin
ten
pairs
of
gloves
a
sponge
two
gimlets
five
jars
of
cold
cream
a
copy
of
the
clergy
list
three
a
mariner
compass
a
box
of
an
six
blouses
and
a
cabman
whistle
the
theft
had
been
proved
by
albert
jobson
a
shopwalker
who
gave
evidence
to
the
effect
that
he
followed
her
through
the
different
departments
and
saw
her
take
the
things
mentioned
in
the
indictment
just
a
moment
interrupted
the
judge
who
is
defending
the
prisoner
there
was
an
unexpected
silence
rupert
carleton
who
had
dropped
idly
into
court
looked
round
in
sudden
excitement
the
poor
girl
had
no
counsel
what
if
he
yes
he
would
seize
the
chance
he
stood
up
boldly
i
am
my
lord
he
said
rupert
carleton
was
still
in
the
twenties
but
he
had
been
a
briefless
barrister
for
some
years
yet
though
briefs
would
not
come
he
had
been
very
far
from
idle
he
had
stood
for
parliament
in
both
the
conservative
and
liberal
interests
not
to
mention
his
own
he
had
written
unproduced
plays
and
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
but
success
in
his
own
profession
had
been
delayed
now
at
last
was
his
opportunity
he
pulled
his
wig
down
firmly
over
his
ears
took
out
a
pair
of
and
rose
to
it
was
the
which
was
to
make
him
famous
the
which
is
now
given
as
a
model
in
every
legal
jobson
he
began
suavely
you
say
that
you
saw
the
accused
steal
these
various
articles
and
that
they
were
afterwards
found
upon
her
yes
i
put
it
to
you
said
rupert
and
waited
intently
for
the
answer
that
that
is
a
pure
invention
on
your
part
no
with
a
superhuman
effort
rupert
hid
his
disappointment
unexpected
as
the
answer
was
he
preserved
his
impassivity
i
suggest
he
tried
again
that
you
followed
her
about
and
concealed
this
collection
of
things
in
her
cloak
with
a
view
to
advertising
your
winter
sale
no
i
saw
her
steal
them
rupert
frowned
the
man
seemed
impervious
to
the
simplest
suggestion
with
masterly
decision
he
tapped
his
and
fell
back
upon
his
third
line
of
defence
you
saw
her
steal
them
what
you
mean
is
that
you
saw
her
take
them
from
the
different
counters
and
put
them
in
her
bag
yes
with
the
intention
of
paying
for
them
in
the
ordinary
way
no
please
be
very
careful
you
said
in
your
evidence
that
prisoner
when
told
she
would
be
charged
cried
think
that
i
should
have
come
to
this
will
no
one
save
me
i
suggest
that
she
went
up
to
you
with
her
collection
of
purchases
pulled
out
her
purse
and
said
does
all
this
come
to
i
ca
get
any
one
to
serve
me
no
the
obstinacy
of
some
people
rupert
put
back
his
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
another
pair
the
historic
continued
we
will
let
that
pass
for
the
moment
he
said
he
consulted
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
and
then
looked
sternly
at
jobson
jobson
how
many
times
have
you
been
married
once
quite
so
he
hesitated
and
then
decided
to
risk
it
i
suggest
that
your
wife
left
you
yes
it
was
a
long
shot
but
once
again
the
bold
course
had
paid
rupert
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
will
you
tell
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
he
said
with
deadly
politeness
she
left
you
she
died
a
lesser
man
might
have
been
embarrassed
but
rupert
iron
nerve
did
not
fail
him
exactly
he
said
and
was
that
or
was
that
not
on
the
night
when
you
were
turned
out
of
the
hampstead
parliament
for
intoxication
i
never
was
indeed
will
you
cast
your
mind
back
to
the
night
of
april
what
were
you
doing
on
that
night
i
have
no
idea
said
jobson
after
casting
his
mind
back
and
waiting
in
vain
for
some
result
in
that
case
you
can
not
swear
that
you
were
not
being
turned
out
of
the
hampstead
parliament
but
i
never
belonged
to
it
rupert
leaped
at
the
damaging
admission
what
you
told
the
court
you
lived
at
hampstead
and
yet
you
say
that
you
never
belonged
to
the
hampstead
parliament
is
your
idea
of
patriotism
i
said
i
lived
at
hackney
to
the
hackney
parliament
i
should
say
i
am
suggesting
that
you
were
turned
out
of
the
hackney
parliament
i
do
belong
to
that
either
exactly
said
rupert
triumphantly
having
been
turned
out
for
intoxication
and
never
did
belong
indeed
may
i
take
it
then
that
you
prefer
to
spend
your
evenings
in
the
if
you
want
to
know
said
jobson
angrily
i
belong
to
the
hackney
chess
circle
and
that
takes
up
most
of
my
evenings
rupert
gave
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
turned
to
the
jury
gentlemen
we
have
got
it
i
thought
we
should
arrive
at
the
truth
in
the
end
in
spite
of
jobson
prevarications
he
turned
to
the
witness
now
sir
he
said
sternly
you
have
already
told
the
court
that
you
have
no
idea
what
you
were
doing
on
the
night
of
april
i
put
it
to
you
once
more
that
this
blankness
of
memory
is
due
to
the
fact
that
you
were
in
a
state
of
intoxication
on
the
premises
of
the
hackney
chess
circle
can
you
swear
on
your
oath
that
this
is
not
so
a
murmur
of
admiration
for
the
relentless
way
in
which
the
truth
had
been
tracked
down
ran
through
the
court
rupert
drew
himself
up
and
put
on
both
pairs
of
at
once
come
sir
he
said
the
jury
is
waiting
but
it
was
not
albert
jobson
who
answered
it
was
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
my
lord
he
said
getting
up
slowly
this
has
come
as
a
complete
surprise
to
me
in
the
circumstances
i
must
advise
my
clients
to
withdraw
from
the
case
a
very
proper
decision
said
his
lordship
the
prisoner
is
discharged
without
a
stain
on
her
character
briefs
poured
in
upon
rupert
next
day
and
he
was
engaged
for
all
the
big
chancery
cases
within
a
week
his
six
plays
were
accepted
and
within
a
fortnight
he
had
entered
parliament
as
the
miners
member
for
coalville
his
marriage
took
place
at
the
end
of
a
month
the
wedding
presents
were
even
more
numerous
and
costly
than
usual
and
included
yards
of
ten
pairs
of
gloves
a
sponge
two
gimlets
five
jars
of
cold
cream
a
copy
of
the
clergy
list
three
hat
guards
a
mariner
compass
a
box
of
an
six
blouses
and
a
cabman
whistle
they
were
marked
quite
simply
from
a
grateful
friend
xlix
the
civil
servant
it
was
three
and
the
afternoon
sun
reddened
the
western
windows
of
one
of
the
busiest
of
government
offices
in
an
airy
room
on
the
third
floor
richard
dale
was
batting
standing
in
front
of
the
with
the
in
his
hands
he
was
a
model
of
the
strenuous
young
englishman
and
as
for
the
third
time
he
turned
the
government
neatly
in
the
direction
of
and
so
completed
his
fifty
the
bowler
could
hardly
repress
a
sigh
of
envious
admiration
even
the
reserved
matthews
who
was
too
old
for
cricket
looked
up
a
moment
from
his
putting
and
said
well
played
dick
the
fourth
occupant
of
the
room
was
busy
at
his
desk
as
if
to
give
the
lie
to
the
thoughtless
accusation
that
the
civil
service
cultivates
the
body
at
the
expense
of
the
mind
the
eager
shouts
of
the
players
seemed
to
annoy
him
for
he
frowned
and
bit
his
pen
or
else
passed
his
fingers
restlessly
through
his
hair
how
the
dickens
do
you
expect
any
one
to
think
in
this
confounded
noise
he
cried
suddenly
what
the
matter
ashby
you
the
matter
how
am
i
going
to
get
these
verses
done
for
evening
if
you
make
such
a
row
why
do
you
go
out
to
tea
good
idea
come
on
dale
you
coming
matthews
they
went
out
leaving
the
room
to
ashby
in
his
youth
harold
ashby
had
often
been
told
by
his
relations
that
he
had
a
literary
bent
his
letters
home
from
school
were
generally
pronounced
to
be
good
enough
for
and
some
of
them
together
with
a
certificate
of
character
from
his
vicar
were
actually
sent
to
that
paper
but
as
he
grew
up
he
realised
that
his
genius
was
better
fitted
for
work
of
a
more
solid
character
his
post
in
the
civil
service
gave
him
full
leisure
for
his
a
his
of
the
and
his
in
rural
and
yet
left
him
ample
time
in
which
to
contribute
to
the
journalism
of
the
day
the
poem
he
was
now
finishing
for
evening
was
his
first
contribution
to
that
paper
but
he
had
little
doubt
that
it
would
be
accepted
it
was
called
quite
simply
love
and
death
and
it
began
like
this
love
o
love
all
other
things
above
why
o
why
am
i
afraid
to
die
there
were
six
more
lines
which
i
have
forgotten
but
i
suppose
they
gave
the
reason
for
this
absurd
diffidence
having
written
the
poem
out
neatly
harold
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
took
it
round
to
evening
the
strain
of
composition
had
left
him
rather
weak
and
he
decided
to
give
his
brain
a
rest
for
the
next
few
days
so
it
happened
that
he
was
at
the
wickets
on
the
following
wednesday
afternoon
when
the
commissionaire
brought
him
in
the
historic
letter
he
opened
it
hastily
the
shovel
under
his
arm
dear
sir
wrote
the
editor
of
evening
will
you
come
round
and
see
me
as
soon
as
convenient
harold
lost
no
time
explaining
that
he
would
finish
his
innings
later
he
put
his
coat
on
took
his
hat
and
stick
and
dashed
out
how
do
you
do
said
the
editor
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
your
work
we
all
liked
your
little
poem
very
much
it
will
be
coming
out
thursday
said
harold
helpfully
i
was
wondering
whether
we
could
get
you
to
join
our
staff
does
the
idea
of
doing
aunt
miriam
cosy
corner
in
our
afternoon
edition
appeal
to
you
at
all
no
said
harold
not
a
bit
ah
that
a
pity
he
tapped
his
desk
thoughtfully
well
then
how
would
you
like
to
be
a
war
correspondent
very
much
said
harold
i
was
considered
to
write
rather
good
letters
home
from
school
splendid
there
this
little
war
in
mexico
when
can
you
start
all
expenses
and
fifty
pounds
a
week
you
not
very
busy
at
the
office
just
now
i
suppose
i
could
get
sick
leave
easily
enough
said
harold
if
it
was
for
more
than
eight
or
nine
months
do
that
will
be
excellent
here
a
blank
cheque
for
your
outfit
can
you
get
off
but
i
suppose
you
have
one
or
two
things
to
finish
up
at
the
office
first
well
said
harold
cautiously
i
in
and
i
made
but
if
i
go
back
and
finish
my
innings
now
and
then
have
for
buying
things
i
could
get
off
on
friday
good
said
the
editor
well
here
luck
come
back
alive
if
you
can
and
if
you
do
we
sha
forget
you
harold
spent
the
next
day
buying
a
war
correspondent
outfit
the
camel
the
travelling
bath
the
putties
the
pith
helmet
the
quinine
the
and
the
other
necessities
of
active
service
on
the
friday
his
colleagues
at
the
office
came
down
in
a
body
to
southampton
to
see
him
off
little
did
they
think
that
nearly
a
year
would
elapse
before
he
again
set
foot
upon
england
i
shall
not
describe
all
his
famous
at
mexico
sufficient
to
say
that
experience
taught
him
quickly
all
that
he
had
need
to
learn
and
that
whereas
he
was
more
than
a
week
late
with
his
cabled
account
of
the
first
engagement
of
the
war
he
was
frequently
more
than
a
week
early
afterwards
indeed
the
battle
of
parson
nose
so
realistically
described
in
his
last
telegram
is
still
waiting
to
be
fought
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
it
will
be
in
time
for
his
book
the
mexicans
in
which
is
coming
out
next
month
on
his
return
to
england
harold
found
that
time
had
wrought
many
changes
to
begin
with
the
editor
of
evening
had
passed
on
to
morning
you
had
better
take
his
place
said
the
ducal
proprietor
to
harold
right
said
harold
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
resign
my
post
at
the
office
just
as
you
like
i
do
see
why
you
should
i
should
miss
the
cricket
said
harold
wistfully
and
the
salary
i
go
round
see
what
i
can
arrange
but
there
were
also
changes
at
the
office
harold
had
been
rising
steadily
in
salary
and
seniority
during
his
absence
and
he
found
to
his
delight
that
he
was
now
a
principal
clerk
he
found
too
that
he
had
acquired
quite
a
reputation
in
the
office
for
quickness
and
efficiency
in
his
new
work
the
first
thing
to
arrange
about
was
his
holiday
he
had
had
no
holiday
for
more
than
a
year
and
there
were
some
eight
weeks
owing
to
him
hullo
said
the
assistant
secretary
as
harold
came
in
looking
well
i
suppose
you
can
manage
to
get
away
for
the
weekends
i
been
away
on
sick
leave
for
some
time
said
harold
pathetically
have
you
you
kept
it
very
secret
come
out
and
have
lunch
with
me
and
we
do
a
afterwards
harold
went
out
with
him
happily
it
would
be
pleasant
to
accept
the
editorship
of
evening
without
giving
up
the
governmental
work
which
was
so
dear
to
him
and
the
assistant
secretary
words
made
this
possible
for
a
year
or
so
anyhow
then
when
his
absence
from
the
office
began
to
be
noticed
it
would
be
time
to
think
of
retiring
on
an
adequate
pension
the
actor
levinski
the
famous
dragged
himself
from
beneath
the
car
took
the
snow
out
of
his
mouth
and
swore
heartily
mortal
men
are
liable
to
motor
accidents
even
king
cars
have
backfired
but
it
seems
strange
that
are
not
specially
exempt
from
these
occurrences
levinski
was
not
only
angry
he
was
also
a
little
shocked
when
an
has
to
walk
two
miles
to
the
nearest
town
on
a
winter
evening
one
may
be
pardoned
a
doubt
as
to
whether
all
is
quite
right
with
the
world
but
the
completest
tragedy
has
its
compensations
for
some
one
the
pitiable
arrival
of
levinski
at
the
duke
head
unrecognised
and
with
his
fur
coat
slightly
ruffled
might
make
a
sceptic
of
the
most
devout
optimist
and
yet
eustace
merrowby
can
never
look
back
upon
that
evening
without
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
for
to
him
it
was
the
beginning
of
his
career
the
story
has
often
been
told
since
in
about
a
dozen
weekly
papers
daily
papers
and
three
dozen
provincial
papers
but
it
will
always
bear
telling
again
there
was
no
train
to
london
that
night
and
levinski
had
been
compelled
to
put
up
at
the
duke
head
however
he
had
dined
and
was
feeling
slightly
better
he
summoned
the
manager
of
the
hotel
what
does
one
do
in
this
damn
place
he
asked
with
a
yawn
the
manager
instantly
recognising
that
he
was
speaking
to
a
member
of
the
aristocracy
made
haste
to
reply
othello
was
being
played
at
the
town
theatre
his
daughter
who
had
already
been
three
times
told
him
that
it
was
very
sweet
he
was
sure
his
lordship
levinski
dismissed
him
and
considered
the
point
he
had
to
amuse
himself
with
something
that
evening
and
the
choice
apparently
lay
between
othello
and
the
local
directory
he
picked
up
the
directory
by
a
lucky
chance
for
eustace
merrowby
it
was
three
years
old
levinski
put
on
his
fur
coat
and
went
to
see
othello
for
some
time
he
was
as
bored
as
he
had
expected
to
be
but
halfway
through
the
third
act
he
began
to
wake
up
there
was
something
in
the
playing
of
the
principal
actor
which
moved
him
strangely
he
looked
at
his
programme
eustace
merrowby
levinski
frowned
thoughtfully
merrowby
he
said
to
himself
i
do
know
the
name
but
he
the
man
i
want
he
took
out
the
gold
pencil
presented
to
him
by
the
emperor
the
had
had
a
and
wrote
a
note
he
was
finishing
breakfast
next
morning
when
merrowby
was
announced
ah
good
morning
said
levinski
good
morning
you
find
me
very
busy
and
here
he
began
to
turn
the
pages
of
the
directory
backwards
and
forwards
but
i
can
give
you
a
moment
what
is
it
you
want
you
asked
me
to
call
on
you
said
eustace
did
i
did
i
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
with
a
noble
gesture
i
am
so
busy
i
forget
ah
now
i
remember
i
saw
you
play
last
night
you
are
the
man
i
want
i
am
producing
baas
the
great
south
african
drama
next
april
at
my
theatre
perhaps
you
know
i
have
read
about
it
in
the
papers
said
eustace
in
all
the
papers
he
might
have
added
every
day
for
the
last
six
months
good
then
you
may
have
heard
that
one
of
the
scenes
is
an
ostrich
farm
i
want
you
to
play
one
of
the
ostriches
asked
eustace
i
do
not
offer
the
part
of
an
ostrich
to
a
man
who
has
played
tommy
is
the
kaffir
boy
who
looks
after
the
farm
it
is
a
black
part
like
your
present
one
but
not
so
long
in
london
you
can
not
expect
to
take
the
leading
parts
just
yet
this
is
very
kind
of
you
said
eustace
gratefully
i
have
always
longed
to
get
to
london
and
to
start
in
your
theatre
it
a
wonderful
chance
good
said
levinski
then
that
settled
he
waved
eustace
away
and
took
up
the
directory
again
with
a
air
and
so
eustace
merrowby
came
to
london
it
is
a
great
thing
for
a
young
actor
to
come
to
london
as
levinski
had
warned
him
his
new
part
was
not
so
big
as
that
of
he
had
to
say
hofo
tsetse
which
was
alleged
to
be
kaffir
for
down
sir
to
the
big
ostrich
but
to
be
at
the
george
theatre
at
all
was
an
honour
which
most
men
would
envy
him
and
his
association
with
a
real
ostrich
was
bound
to
bring
him
before
the
public
in
the
pages
of
the
illustrated
papers
eustace
curiously
enough
was
not
very
nervous
on
the
first
night
he
was
fairly
certain
that
he
was
and
if
only
the
ostrich
did
kick
him
in
the
back
of
the
neck
as
it
had
tried
to
once
at
rehearsal
the
evening
seemed
likely
to
be
a
triumph
for
him
and
so
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
pleasurable
anticipation
that
on
the
morning
after
he
gathered
the
papers
round
him
at
breakfast
and
prepared
to
read
what
the
critics
had
to
say
he
had
a
remarkable
press
i
give
a
few
examples
of
the
notices
he
obtained
from
the
leading
papers
eustace
merrowby
was
tommy
the
cast
included
eustace
merrowby
eustace
merrowby
we
have
no
space
in
which
to
mention
all
the
other
performers
this
criticism
only
concerns
the
two
actors
we
have
mentioned
and
does
not
apply
to
the
rest
of
the
cast
where
all
were
so
good
it
would
be
invidious
to
single
out
anybody
for
special
praise
the
acting
deserved
a
better
play
tommy
as
eustace
read
the
papers
he
felt
that
his
future
was
secure
true
careful
never
to
miss
a
single
performer
had
yet
to
say
eustace
merrowby
was
capital
as
tommy
and
tommy
was
capitally
played
by
eustace
merrowby
but
even
without
this
he
had
become
one
of
the
men
who
count
one
whose
private
life
was
of
more
interest
to
the
public
than
that
of
any
scientist
general
or
diplomat
in
the
country
into
eustace
merrowby
subsequent
career
i
can
not
go
at
full
length
it
is
perhaps
as
a
member
of
the
garrick
club
that
he
has
attained
his
fullest
development
all
the
good
things
of
the
garrick
which
were
not
previously
said
by
sydney
smith
may
safely
be
put
down
to
eustace
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
is
the
ringleader
in
all
the
subsequent
practical
jokes
which
have
made
the
club
famous
it
was
he
who
pinned
to
the
back
of
an
unpopular
member
of
the
committee
a
sheet
of
paper
bearing
the
words
kick
me
and
the
occasion
on
which
he
drew
the
chair
from
beneath
a
certain
eminent
author
as
the
latter
was
about
to
sit
down
is
still
referred
to
hilariously
by
the
older
members
finally
as
a
convincing
proof
of
his
greatness
let
it
be
said
that
everybody
has
at
least
heard
the
name
eustace
merrowby
even
though
some
may
be
under
the
impression
that
it
is
the
of
a
sauce
and
that
half
the
young
ladies
of
wandsworth
common
and
winchmore
hill
are
in
love
with
him
if
this
be
not
success
what
is
li
the
collector
when
peter
plimsoll
the
glue
king
died
his
parting
advice
to
his
sons
to
stick
to
the
business
was
followed
only
by
john
the
elder
adrian
the
younger
had
a
soul
above
adhesion
he
disposed
of
his
share
in
the
concern
and
settled
down
to
follow
the
life
of
a
gentleman
of
taste
and
culture
and
more
particularly
patron
of
the
arts
he
began
in
a
modest
way
by
collecting
his
range
at
first
was
catholic
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
acquired
a
hundred
and
of
various
designs
that
he
decided
to
make
a
specialty
of
historic
ones
this
decision
was
hastened
by
the
discovery
that
one
of
queen
inkstands
supposed
by
the
owner
to
be
the
identical
one
with
whose
aid
she
wrote
her
last
letter
to
raleigh
was
about
to
be
put
on
the
market
at
some
expense
adrian
obtained
an
introduction
through
a
third
party
to
the
owner
at
more
expense
the
owner
obtained
through
the
same
gentleman
an
introduction
to
adrian
and
in
less
than
a
month
the
great
elizabeth
was
safely
established
in
adrian
house
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
plimsoll
collection
this
was
twenty
years
ago
let
us
take
a
walk
through
the
galleries
of
adrian
plimsoll
charming
residence
which
as
the
world
knows
overlooks
the
park
any
friend
of
mine
is
always
welcome
at
number
fifteen
we
will
start
with
the
north
gallery
i
fear
that
i
shall
only
have
time
to
point
out
a
few
of
the
choicest
gems
this
is
a
pontesiori
sword
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
only
example
of
the
master
art
without
any
notches
on
the
left
is
a
capricci
if
you
have
never
heard
of
capricci
you
ought
to
come
to
a
house
like
this
here
we
have
before
us
the
historic
de
montigny
topaz
ask
your
little
boy
to
tell
you
about
it
in
the
east
gallery
of
course
the
chief
treasure
is
the
santo
di
santo
amulet
described
so
minutely
in
his
by
john
of
flanders
the
original
of
this
book
is
in
the
south
gallery
you
must
glance
at
it
when
we
get
there
it
will
save
you
the
trouble
of
ordering
a
copy
from
your
library
they
would
be
sure
to
keep
you
waiting
with
some
such
words
as
these
i
lead
my
friends
round
number
fifteen
the
many
treasures
in
the
private
parts
of
the
house
i
may
not
show
of
course
the
bathroom
for
instance
in
which
hangs
the
finest
collection
of
portraits
of
philatelists
that
europe
can
boast
you
must
spend
a
night
with
adrian
to
be
admitted
to
their
company
and
as
one
of
the
elect
i
can
assure
you
that
nothing
can
be
more
stimulating
on
a
winter
morning
than
to
catch
the
eye
of
frisby
dranger
behind
the
taps
as
your
head
first
emerges
from
the
icy
waters
adrian
plimsoll
sat
at
breakfast
sipping
his
hot
water
and
crumbling
a
dry
biscuit
a
light
was
in
his
eye
a
flush
upon
his
pallid
countenance
he
had
just
heard
from
a
trusty
agent
that
the
scutori
had
been
seen
in
devonshire
his
car
was
ready
to
take
him
to
the
station
but
alas
a
disappointment
awaited
him
on
close
examination
the
turned
out
to
be
a
common
risoldo
of
inferior
working
adrian
left
the
house
in
disgust
and
started
on
his
walk
back
to
the
station
to
complete
his
misery
a
sudden
storm
came
on
cursing
alternately
his
agent
and
risoldo
he
made
his
way
to
a
cottage
and
asked
for
shelter
an
old
woman
greeted
him
civilly
and
bade
him
come
in
if
i
may
just
wait
till
the
storm
is
over
said
adrian
and
he
sat
down
in
her
parlour
and
looked
appraisingly
as
was
his
habit
round
the
room
the
grandfather
clock
in
the
corner
was
genuine
but
he
was
beyond
grandfather
clocks
there
was
nothing
else
of
any
value
three
china
dogs
and
some
odd
trinkets
on
the
a
print
or
two
stay
what
was
that
behind
the
youngest
dog
may
i
look
at
that
old
bracelet
he
asked
his
voice
trembling
a
little
and
without
waiting
for
permission
he
walked
over
and
took
up
the
circle
of
tarnished
metal
in
his
hands
as
he
examined
it
his
colour
came
and
went
his
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
with
a
tremendous
effort
he
composed
himself
and
returned
to
his
chair
it
was
the
emperor
bracelet
of
course
you
know
the
history
of
this
most
famous
of
all
bracelets
made
by
spurius
quintus
of
rome
in
it
was
given
by
cæsar
to
cleopatra
who
tried
without
success
to
dissolve
it
in
vinegar
returning
to
rome
by
way
of
antony
it
was
worn
at
a
minor
conflagration
by
nero
after
which
it
was
lost
sight
of
for
many
centuries
it
was
eventually
heard
of
during
the
reign
of
canute
or
knut
as
his
admirers
called
him
and
john
is
known
to
have
lost
it
in
the
wash
whence
it
was
recovered
a
century
afterwards
it
must
have
travelled
thence
to
france
for
it
was
seen
once
in
the
possession
of
louis
xi
and
from
there
to
spain
for
philip
the
handsome
presented
it
to
joanna
on
her
wedding
day
columbus
took
it
to
america
but
fortunately
brought
it
back
again
peter
the
great
threw
it
at
an
indifferent
musician
on
one
of
its
later
visits
to
england
pope
wrote
a
couplet
to
it
and
the
most
astonishing
thing
in
its
whole
history
was
that
now
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
it
had
vanished
completely
to
turn
up
again
in
a
little
devonshire
cottage
verily
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
that
rather
a
curious
bracelet
of
yours
said
adrian
casually
my
er
wife
has
one
just
like
it
which
she
asked
me
to
match
is
it
an
old
friend
or
would
you
care
to
sell
it
my
mother
gave
it
me
said
the
old
woman
and
she
had
it
from
hers
i
do
know
no
further
than
that
i
did
mean
to
sell
it
but
quite
right
said
adrian
and
after
all
i
can
easily
get
another
but
i
wo
say
a
bit
of
money
would
be
useful
what
would
you
think
a
fair
price
sir
five
shillings
adrian
heart
jumped
to
get
the
emperor
bracelet
for
five
shillings
but
the
spirit
of
the
collector
rose
up
strong
within
him
he
laughed
kindly
my
good
woman
he
said
they
turn
out
bracelets
like
that
in
birmingham
at
two
shillings
apiece
and
quite
new
i
give
you
tenpence
make
it
she
pleaded
times
are
hard
adrian
reflected
he
was
not
strictly
speaking
impoverished
he
could
afford
he
said
no
no
she
repeated
obstinately
adrian
reflected
again
after
all
he
could
always
sell
it
for
ten
thousand
pounds
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
well
well
he
sighed
let
it
be
he
counted
out
the
money
carefully
then
putting
the
precious
bracelet
in
his
pocket
he
rose
to
go
adrian
has
no
relations
living
now
when
he
dies
he
proposes
to
leave
the
plimsoll
collection
to
the
nation
having
as
far
as
he
can
foresee
no
particular
use
for
it
in
the
next
world
this
is
really
very
generous
of
him
and
no
doubt
when
the
time
comes
the
papers
will
say
so
but
it
is
a
pity
that
he
can
not
be
appreciated
properly
in
his
lifetime
personally
i
should
like
to
see
him
knighted
lii
the
statesman
on
a
certain
night
in
the
middle
of
the
season
all
london
was
gathered
in
lady
marchpane
all
london
that
is
which
was
worth
knowing
a
qualification
which
accounted
for
the
absence
of
several
million
people
who
had
never
heard
of
lady
marchpane
in
one
corner
of
the
room
an
ambassador
with
a
few
ribbons
across
his
chest
could
have
been
seen
chatting
to
the
latest
american
duchess
in
another
corner
one
of
our
largest
advertisers
was
exchanging
epigrams
with
a
titled
newspaper
proprietor
famous
generals
rubbed
shoulders
with
artists
financiers
whispered
sweet
nothings
to
breeders
of
prize
poms
even
an
might
have
been
seen
accepting
an
apology
from
a
royalty
who
had
jostled
him
hallo
said
algy
lascelles
catching
sight
of
the
dignified
figure
of
rupert
meryton
in
the
crowd
how
william
a
rare
smile
lit
up
rupert
distinguished
features
he
was
for
invasion
affairs
and
william
was
algy
pleasant
way
of
referring
to
the
bill
which
he
was
now
piloting
through
the
house
of
commons
it
was
a
measure
for
doing
something
or
other
by
means
of
a
what
call
it
i
can
not
be
more
precise
without
precipitating
a
european
conflict
i
think
we
shall
get
it
through
said
rupert
calmly
lady
marchpane
was
talking
about
it
just
now
she
rather
interested
you
know
rupert
lips
closed
about
his
mouth
in
a
firm
line
he
looked
over
algy
head
into
the
crowd
oh
he
said
coldly
it
was
barely
ten
years
ago
that
young
meryton
just
down
from
oxford
had
startled
the
political
world
by
capturing
the
important
seat
of
cricklewood
for
the
tariffadicals
as
to
avoid
plunging
the
country
into
civil
war
i
must
call
them
this
was
at
a
and
the
liberatives
had
immediately
dissolved
only
to
come
into
power
after
the
general
election
with
an
increased
majority
through
the
years
that
followed
rupert
meryton
by
his
pertinacity
in
asking
the
invasion
secretary
questions
which
had
been
answered
by
him
on
the
previous
day
and
by
his
regard
for
the
dignity
of
the
house
as
shown
in
his
invariable
comment
come
come
not
quite
the
gentleman
upon
any
display
of
bad
manners
opposite
established
a
clear
right
to
a
post
in
the
subsequent
tariffadical
government
he
had
now
been
for
two
years
and
in
this
bill
his
first
real
chance
had
come
oh
there
you
are
meryton
said
a
voice
come
and
talk
to
me
a
moment
with
a
nod
to
a
couple
of
archbishops
lady
marchpane
led
the
way
to
a
little
gallery
whither
the
crowd
had
not
penetrated
priceless
correggios
tintorettos
and
chestertons
hung
upon
the
walls
but
it
was
not
to
show
him
these
that
she
had
come
dropping
into
a
wonderful
old
chippendale
chair
she
motioned
him
to
a
opposite
her
and
looked
at
him
with
a
curious
smile
well
she
said
about
the
bill
rupert
lips
closed
about
his
mouth
in
a
firm
line
he
was
rather
good
at
this
folding
his
arms
he
gazed
steadily
into
lady
still
beautiful
eyes
it
will
go
through
he
said
through
all
its
stages
he
added
professionally
it
must
not
go
through
said
lady
marchpane
gently
rupert
could
not
repress
a
start
but
he
was
master
of
himself
again
in
a
moment
i
can
not
add
anything
to
my
previous
statement
he
said
if
it
goes
through
began
lady
marchpane
i
must
refer
you
said
rupert
to
my
answer
of
yesterday
come
come
meryton
what
is
the
good
of
fencing
with
me
you
know
the
position
or
shall
i
state
it
for
you
again
i
can
not
believe
you
are
serious
i
am
perfectly
serious
there
are
reasons
financial
reasons
and
others
why
i
do
not
want
this
bill
to
pass
in
return
for
my
silence
upon
a
certain
matter
you
are
going
to
prevent
it
passing
you
know
to
what
i
refer
on
the
of
may
last
stop
cried
rupert
hoarsely
on
the
of
may
last
lady
marchpane
went
on
relentlessly
you
and
i
in
the
absence
of
my
husband
abroad
had
tea
together
at
an
rupert
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
i
am
no
fonder
of
scandal
than
you
are
but
if
you
do
not
meet
my
wishes
i
shall
certainly
confess
the
truth
to
marchpane
you
will
be
ruined
too
said
rupert
my
husband
will
forgive
me
and
take
me
back
she
paused
significantly
will
marjorie
hale
rupert
covered
his
hands
with
his
face
will
the
good
miss
hale
forgive
you
she
is
very
strict
is
she
not
and
rich
and
rising
young
politicians
want
money
more
than
scandal
she
raised
her
head
suddenly
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
ah
archbishop
i
was
just
calling
meryton
attention
to
this
wonderful
botticell
she
looked
at
it
more
closely
this
wonderful
dana
gibson
a
beautiful
piece
of
work
is
it
not
the
intruders
passed
on
to
the
and
they
were
alone
again
what
am
i
to
do
said
rupert
sullenly
the
fate
of
the
bill
is
settled
week
when
you
make
your
big
speech
you
must
speak
against
it
confess
frankly
you
were
mistaken
it
will
be
a
close
thing
anyhow
your
influence
will
turn
the
scale
it
will
ruin
me
politically
you
will
marry
marjorie
hale
and
be
rich
no
rich
man
is
ever
ruined
politically
or
socially
she
patted
his
hand
gently
you
do
it
he
got
up
slowly
you
see
next
week
he
said
it
is
not
meet
that
we
should
watch
the
unhappy
rupert
through
the
hours
of
the
night
as
he
wrestled
with
the
terrible
problem
a
moment
sudden
madness
on
that
may
afternoon
had
brought
him
to
the
on
the
one
hand
reputation
wealth
the
girl
that
he
loved
on
the
other
his
own
honour
and
so
at
least
he
had
said
several
times
on
the
platform
the
safety
of
england
he
rose
in
the
morning
weary
but
with
his
mind
made
up
the
bill
should
go
through
rupert
meryton
was
a
speaker
of
a
not
unusual
type
although
he
provided
the
opinions
himself
he
always
depended
upon
his
secretary
for
the
arguments
with
which
to
support
them
and
the
actual
words
in
which
to
give
them
being
but
on
this
occasion
he
felt
that
a
special
effort
was
required
of
him
he
would
show
lady
marchpane
that
the
blackmail
of
yesterday
had
only
roused
him
to
a
still
greater
sacrifice
on
behalf
of
his
country
would
write
his
own
on
the
fateful
night
the
house
was
crowded
it
seemed
that
all
the
guests
at
lady
marchpane
a
week
before
were
in
the
distinguished
strangers
gallery
or
behind
the
ladies
grille
from
the
press
gallery
our
special
looked
down
upon
the
statesmen
beneath
him
his
eagle
eye
ready
to
detect
on
the
moment
the
angry
flush
the
wince
or
the
sudden
paling
of
enemy
the
grim
smile
or
the
lofty
calm
of
friend
the
rt
hon
rupert
meryton
tariffadical
member
for
cricklewood
rose
to
his
feet
amidst
cheers
speaker
he
said
i
rise
er
sir
to
er
so
much
of
his
speech
i
may
give
but
urgent
state
reasons
compel
me
to
withhold
the
rest
were
it
ever
known
with
which
bill
the
secret
history
that
i
have
disclosed
concerns
itself
the
great
powers
in
an
instant
would
be
at
each
other
throats
but
though
i
may
not
disclose
the
speech
i
can
tell
of
its
effect
on
the
house
and
its
effect
was
curious
it
was
in
short
the
exact
opposite
of
what
rupert
meryton
that
promising
under
secretary
had
intended
it
was
the
first
speech
that
he
had
ever
prepared
himself
than
rupert
there
was
no
more
dignified
figure
in
the
house
of
commons
his
honour
was
proof
as
we
have
seen
against
the
most
insidious
temptations
yet
since
one
man
can
not
have
all
the
virtues
he
was
distinctly
stupid
it
would
have
been
a
hopeless
speech
anyhow
but
to
make
matters
worse
he
had
in
the
most
important
part
of
it
attempted
irony
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
ironical
passage
even
the
tariffadical
had
to
confess
that
it
was
their
own
stalwarts
who
suddenly
paled
as
lady
marchpane
had
said
it
was
bound
to
be
a
close
thing
the
liberatives
and
the
unialists
of
course
were
solid
against
the
bill
but
there
was
also
something
of
a
cave
in
the
tariffadical
party
it
was
bound
to
be
a
close
thing
and
rupert
speech
just
made
the
difference
when
he
sat
down
the
waverers
and
doubters
had
made
up
their
minds
the
bill
was
defeated
that
the
tariffadicals
should
resign
was
natural
perhaps
it
was
equally
natural
that
rupert
secretary
should
resign
too
he
said
that
his
reputation
would
be
gone
if
rupert
made
any
more
speeches
on
his
own
and
that
he
was
going
to
risk
it
without
his
secretary
rupert
was
lost
at
the
general
election
which
followed
fortunately
he
had
a
grateful
friend
in
lady
marchpane
she
exerted
her
influence
with
the
liberatives
and
got
him
an
appointment
as
governor
of
the
stickjaw
islands
here
with
his
beautiful
and
rich
wife
sir
rupert
meryton
maintains
a
regal
state
and
upon
his
name
no
breath
of
scandal
rests
indeed
his
only
trouble
so
far
has
been
with
the
stickjaw
language
a
difficult
language
but
one
which
perhaps
fortunately
does
not
lend
itself
to
irony
liii
the
magnate
it
was
in
october
that
the
word
zinc
first
began
to
be
heard
in
financial
circles
city
men
pushing
their
dominoes
regretfully
away
and
murmuring
zinc
in
apologetic
tones
were
back
in
their
offices
by
three
forgetting
in
their
haste
to
leave
the
usual
twopence
under
the
cup
for
the
waitress
clubmen
glancing
at
the
tape
on
their
way
to
the
said
to
their
neighbours
zinc
moved
a
point
i
see
before
covering
themselves
up
with
the
in
the
trains
returning
husbands
asked
each
other
loudly
what
all
this
about
zinc
all
save
the
very
innocent
ones
who
whispered
i
say
what
zinc
exactly
the
took
it
up
no
sooner
had
the
word
zinc
left
the
lips
of
an
acknowledged
comedian
than
the
house
was
in
roars
of
laughter
the
furore
at
the
collodium
when
octavius
octo
in
his
part
of
the
landlady
of
a
remarked
i
know
why
my
ole
man
so
late
buying
zinc
is
still
remembered
in
the
bars
round
piccadilly
to
explain
it
properly
it
will
be
necessary
my
readers
will
be
alarmed
to
hear
to
go
back
some
thirty
years
this
as
a
simple
calculation
shows
takes
us
to
june
it
was
in
june
that
felix
moses
a
stout
young
man
of
attractive
appearance
if
you
care
for
that
style
took
his
courage
in
both
hands
and
told
phyllida
sloan
that
he
was
worth
ten
thousand
a
year
and
was
changing
his
name
to
mountenay
miss
sloan
seeing
that
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
proposal
said
hastily
that
she
was
changing
hers
to
abraham
you
marrying
leo
abraham
asked
felix
in
amazement
ah
a
gust
of
jealousy
swept
over
him
he
licked
his
lips
there
was
a
dangerous
look
in
his
eyes
a
look
that
was
destined
in
after
days
to
make
emperors
and
rival
financiers
quail
ah
he
said
softly
leo
abraham
i
shall
not
forget
and
now
it
will
be
necessary
my
readers
will
be
relieved
to
learn
to
jump
forward
some
thirty
years
this
obviously
takes
us
to
september
let
us
on
this
fine
september
morning
take
a
peep
into
throgneedle
street
and
see
how
the
business
of
the
mother
city
is
carried
on
on
the
fourth
floor
we
come
to
the
sanctum
of
the
great
man
himself
felix
mountenay
no
admittance
is
painted
upon
the
outer
door
it
is
a
name
which
is
known
and
feared
all
over
europe
private
detective
stands
on
one
side
of
the
door
on
the
other
side
is
mountenay
private
wolfhound
murmuring
the
word
press
however
we
pass
hastily
through
and
find
ourselves
before
mountenay
himself
mountenay
is
at
work
let
us
watch
him
through
a
typical
five
minutes
for
a
moment
he
stands
meditating
in
the
middle
of
the
room
kings
are
tottering
on
their
thrones
empires
hang
upon
his
nod
what
will
he
decide
suddenly
he
blows
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
his
cigar
and
rushes
to
the
telephone
hallo
is
that
you
jones
what
are
margarine
at
no
margarine
prefs
idiot
ah
then
sell
keep
on
selling
till
i
tell
you
to
stop
yes
he
hangs
up
the
receiver
for
two
minutes
he
paces
the
room
smoking
rapidly
he
stops
a
moment
but
it
is
only
to
remove
his
which
is
in
danger
of
burning
then
he
resumes
his
pacings
another
minute
goes
rapidly
by
he
rushes
to
the
telephone
again
hallo
is
that
you
jones
what
are
margarine
prefs
down
to
now
ah
then
buy
keep
on
buying
yes
he
hangs
up
the
receiver
by
this
he
has
made
a
quarter
of
a
million
it
may
seem
to
you
or
me
an
easy
way
of
doing
it
ah
but
what
we
must
ask
ourselves
of
the
great
brain
that
conceived
the
idea
the
foresight
which
told
the
exact
moment
when
to
put
it
into
action
the
cool
courage
which
seized
the
moment
what
of
the
grasp
of
affairs
the
knowledge
of
men
ah
can
we
grudge
it
him
that
he
earns
a
quarter
of
a
million
more
quickly
than
we
do
yet
felix
mountenay
is
not
happy
when
we
have
brought
off
a
coup
for
a
hundred
thousand
even
we
smile
gaily
mountenay
did
not
smile
fiercely
he
bit
another
inch
off
his
cigar
and
muttered
to
himself
the
words
were
leo
abraham
wait
this
is
positively
the
last
row
of
stars
let
us
take
advantage
of
them
to
jump
forward
another
month
it
was
october
if
that
was
a
sunday
then
it
was
october
anyhow
it
was
october
felix
mountenay
was
sleeping
in
his
office
for
once
that
iron
brain
relaxed
he
had
made
a
little
over
three
million
in
the
last
month
and
the
strain
was
too
much
for
him
but
a
knock
at
the
door
restored
him
instantly
to
his
own
cool
self
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
his
secretary
but
somebody
is
selling
zinc
the
word
zinc
touched
a
chord
in
mountenay
brain
which
had
lain
dormant
for
years
zinc
why
did
zinc
remind
him
of
leo
abraham
fetch
the
encyclopædia
britannica
quick
he
cried
the
secretary
a
man
of
herculean
build
returned
with
some
of
it
with
the
luck
which
proverbially
attends
rich
men
mountenay
picked
up
the
z
volume
at
once
as
he
read
the
zinc
article
it
all
came
back
to
him
leo
abraham
had
owned
an
empty
was
his
enemy
in
his
clutches
at
last
buy
he
said
briefly
in
a
fortnight
the
secretary
had
returned
well
said
mountenay
have
you
bought
all
the
zinc
that
there
is
yes
sir
said
the
secretary
and
a
lot
that
there
is
he
added
good
he
paused
a
moment
when
leo
abraham
calls
he
added
grimly
show
him
up
at
once
it
was
a
month
later
that
a
haggard
man
climbed
the
stairs
of
throgneedle
street
and
was
shown
into
mountenay
room
well
said
the
financier
softly
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
want
some
zinc
said
leo
abergavenny
zinc
said
mountenay
with
a
smile
is
a
million
pounds
a
ton
or
an
acre
or
a
gallon
or
however
you
prefer
to
buy
it
he
added
humorously
leo
went
white
you
wish
to
ruin
me
i
do
a
promise
i
made
to
your
wife
some
years
ago
my
wife
cried
leo
what
do
you
mean
i
not
married
it
was
mountenay
turn
to
go
white
he
went
it
not
married
but
miss
sloan
leo
abergavenny
sat
down
and
mopped
his
face
i
do
know
what
you
mean
he
said
i
asked
miss
sloan
to
marry
me
and
told
her
i
was
changing
my
name
to
abergavenny
and
she
said
that
she
was
changing
hers
to
moses
naturally
i
thought
stop
cried
mountenay
he
sat
down
heavily
something
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
his
life
in
a
moment
the
world
was
empty
he
looked
up
at
his
old
rival
and
forced
a
laugh
well
well
he
said
she
deceived
us
both
let
us
drink
to
our
lucky
escape
he
rang
the
bell
and
then
he
said
in
a
purring
voice
we
can
have
a
little
talk
about
zinc
after
all
business
is
still
business
liv
the
adventurer
lionel
norwood
from
his
earliest
days
had
been
marked
out
for
a
life
of
crime
when
quite
a
child
he
was
discovered
by
his
nurse
killing
flies
on
the
this
was
before
the
character
of
the
had
become
a
matter
of
common
talk
among
scientists
and
lionel
like
all
great
men
a
little
before
his
time
had
pleaded
hygiene
in
vain
he
was
smacked
hastily
and
bundled
off
to
a
preparatory
school
where
his
aptitude
for
smuggling
sweets
would
have
lost
him
many
a
had
not
his
services
been
required
at
in
the
hockey
eleven
with
some
difficulty
he
managed
to
pass
into
eton
and
three
years
later
with
one
would
imagine
still
more
difficulty
managed
to
get
superannuated
at
cambridge
he
went
rapidly
he
would
think
nothing
of
smoking
a
cigar
in
academical
costume
and
on
at
least
one
occasion
he
drove
a
dogcart
on
sunday
no
wonder
that
he
was
requested
early
in
his
second
year
to
give
up
his
struggle
with
the
and
betake
himself
back
to
london
london
is
always
glad
to
welcome
such
people
as
lionel
norwood
in
no
other
city
is
it
so
simple
for
a
man
of
easy
conscience
to
earn
a
living
by
his
wits
if
lionel
ever
had
any
scruples
which
after
a
perusal
of
the
above
account
of
his
early
days
it
may
be
permitted
one
to
doubt
they
were
removed
by
an
accident
to
his
solicitor
who
was
run
over
in
the
argentine
on
the
very
day
that
he
arrived
there
with
what
was
left
of
lionel
money
reduced
suddenly
to
poverty
norwood
had
no
choice
but
to
enter
upon
a
life
of
crime
except
perhaps
that
he
used
slightly
less
than
most
he
seemed
just
the
ordinary
man
about
town
as
he
sat
in
his
one
fine
summer
morning
and
smoked
a
cigarette
his
rooms
were
furnished
quietly
and
in
the
best
of
taste
no
signs
of
his
nefarious
profession
showed
themselves
to
the
casual
visitor
the
appealing
letters
from
the
princess
whom
he
was
blackmailing
the
wire
apparatus
which
shot
the
two
of
spades
down
his
sleeve
during
the
nights
at
the
club
the
thimble
and
pea
with
which
he
had
performed
the
trick
so
successfully
at
epsom
last
week
all
these
were
hidden
away
from
the
common
gaze
it
was
a
young
gentleman
of
fashion
who
lounged
in
his
chair
and
toyed
with
a
priceless
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
masters
his
confidential
valet
came
in
well
said
lionel
have
you
looked
through
the
post
yes
sir
said
the
man
there
the
usual
cheque
from
her
highness
a
request
for
more
time
from
the
lady
in
tite
street
with
twopence
to
pay
on
the
envelope
and
banknotes
from
the
professor
as
expected
the
young
gentleman
of
hill
street
has
gone
abroad
suddenly
sir
ah
said
lionel
with
a
sudden
frown
i
suppose
you
better
cross
him
off
our
list
masters
yes
sir
i
had
ventured
to
do
so
sir
i
think
that
all
except
that
snooks
is
glad
to
accept
your
kind
invitation
to
dinner
and
bridge
will
you
wear
the
coat
sir
or
the
metal
clip
lionel
made
no
answer
he
sat
plunged
in
thought
when
he
spoke
it
was
about
another
matter
masters
he
said
i
have
found
out
lord
fairlie
secret
at
last
i
shall
go
to
see
him
this
afternoon
yes
sir
will
you
wear
your
revolver
sir
as
it
a
first
call
i
think
so
if
this
comes
off
masters
it
will
make
our
fortune
i
hope
so
i
sure
sir
masters
placed
the
whisky
within
reach
and
left
the
room
silently
alone
lionel
picked
up
his
paper
and
turned
to
the
agony
column
as
everybody
knows
the
agony
column
of
a
daily
paper
is
not
actually
so
domestic
as
it
seems
when
apparently
says
to
come
home
at
once
father
gone
away
for
week
bert
and
sid
longing
to
see
you
what
is
really
happening
is
that
barney
hoker
is
telling
jud
batson
to
meet
him
outside
the
duke
of
westminster
little
place
at
precisely
on
tuesday
morning
not
forgetting
to
bring
his
jemmy
and
a
dark
lantern
with
him
and
floss
announcement
next
day
coming
home
with
george
is
jud
way
of
saying
that
he
will
turn
up
all
right
and
half
thinks
of
bringing
his
automatic
pistol
with
him
too
in
case
of
accidents
in
this
language
which
of
course
takes
some
little
learning
lionel
norwood
had
long
been
an
expert
the
advertisement
which
he
was
now
reading
was
unusually
elaborate
lost
in
a
taxi
between
baker
street
and
shepherd
bush
a
umbrella
with
initials
on
it
if
ellen
will
return
to
her
father
immediately
all
will
be
forgiven
white
spot
on
foreleg
mother
very
anxious
and
desires
to
return
thanks
for
kind
enquiries
answers
to
the
name
of
ponto
dat
qui
cito
what
did
it
mean
for
lionel
it
had
no
secrets
he
was
reading
the
revelation
by
one
of
his
agents
of
the
skeleton
in
lord
cupboard
lord
fairlie
was
one
of
the
most
distinguished
members
of
the
cabinet
his
vein
of
high
seriousness
his
lofty
demeanour
the
sincerity
of
his
manner
endeared
him
not
only
to
his
own
party
but
even
astounding
as
it
may
seem
to
a
few
men
upon
the
other
side
who
admitted
in
moments
of
expansion
which
they
probably
regretted
afterwards
that
he
might
after
all
be
as
devoted
to
his
country
as
they
were
for
years
now
his
life
had
been
without
blemish
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
even
in
his
youth
he
could
have
sown
any
wild
oats
terrible
to
think
that
these
wild
oats
might
now
be
coming
home
to
roost
what
do
you
require
of
me
he
said
courteously
to
lionel
as
the
latter
was
shown
into
his
study
lionel
went
to
the
point
at
once
i
am
here
my
lord
he
said
on
business
in
the
course
of
my
ordinary
avocations
the
parliamentary
atmosphere
seemed
to
be
affecting
his
language
i
ascertained
a
certain
secret
in
your
past
life
which
if
it
were
revealed
might
conceivably
have
a
not
undamaging
effect
upon
your
career
for
my
silence
in
this
matter
i
must
demand
a
sum
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
lord
fairlie
had
grown
paler
and
paler
as
this
speech
proceeded
what
have
you
discovered
he
whispered
alas
he
knew
only
too
well
what
the
damning
answer
would
be
years
said
lionel
wrote
a
humorous
lord
fairlie
gave
a
strangled
cry
his
keen
mind
recognised
in
a
flash
what
a
hold
this
knowledge
would
give
his
enemies
of
his
book
had
been
called
already
he
saw
the
leading
articles
of
the
future
we
confess
ourselves
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
lord
speech
at
plymouth
yesterday
was
intended
as
a
supplement
to
his
earlier
work
of
or
as
a
serious
offering
to
a
nation
impatient
of
levity
in
such
a
crisis
the
cabinet
jester
in
whom
twenty
years
ago
the
country
lost
an
excellent
clown
without
gaining
a
statesman
was
in
great
form
last
night
lord
fairlie
has
amused
us
in
the
past
with
his
clever
little
parodies
he
may
amuse
us
in
the
future
but
as
a
statesman
we
can
only
view
him
with
disgust
well
said
lionel
at
last
i
think
your
lordship
is
wise
enough
to
understand
the
discovery
of
a
sense
of
humour
in
a
man
of
your
eminence
but
lord
fairlie
was
already
writing
out
the
cheque
lv
the
explorer
as
the
evening
wore
on
and
one
young
man
after
another
asked
jocelyn
montrevor
if
she
were
going
to
ascot
what
or
to
henley
what
or
what
she
wondered
more
and
more
if
this
were
all
that
life
would
ever
hold
for
her
would
she
never
meet
a
man
a
real
man
who
had
done
something
these
boys
around
her
were
very
pleasant
she
admitted
to
herself
very
useful
indeed
she
added
as
one
approached
her
with
some
refreshment
but
they
were
only
boys
here
you
are
said
freddy
handing
her
an
ice
in
three
colours
had
it
made
specially
cold
for
you
they
only
had
the
green
pink
and
yellow
jerseys
left
i
hope
you
do
mind
the
green
part
is
arsenic
i
believe
if
you
do
want
the
wafer
i
take
it
home
and
put
it
between
the
sashes
of
my
bedroom
window
the
rattling
kept
me
awake
all
last
night
that
why
i
looking
so
ill
jocelyn
smiled
kindly
and
went
on
with
her
ice
that
reminds
me
freddy
went
on
we
got
a
nut
here
the
genuine
thing
none
of
your
society
barcelonas
or
suburban
filberts
one
of
the
real
cob
family
the
and
touch
in
short
a
celebrity
who
asked
jocelyn
eagerly
perhaps
here
was
a
man
worrall
brice
the
explorer
do
say
you
have
heard
of
him
or
aunt
alice
will
cry
heard
of
him
of
course
she
had
heard
of
him
who
had
worrall
brice
adventures
in
distant
parts
of
the
empire
would
have
filled
a
book
had
in
fact
already
filled
three
a
glance
at
his
flat
in
james
street
gave
you
some
idea
of
the
adventures
he
had
been
through
here
were
the
polished
spurs
of
his
companion
in
the
famous
ride
through
australia
from
south
to
north
all
that
had
been
left
by
the
cannibals
of
the
river
after
their
banquet
here
was
the
poisoned
arrow
which
by
the
merciful
intervention
of
providence
just
missed
worrall
and
pierced
the
heart
of
one
of
his
black
attendants
the
happily
revealing
the
presence
of
a
new
and
interesting
poison
here
again
was
the
rope
with
which
he
was
hanged
by
mistake
as
a
spy
in
south
america
a
mistake
which
would
certainly
have
had
fatal
results
if
he
had
not
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
hold
his
breath
during
the
performance
in
yet
another
corner
you
might
see
his
favourite
mascot
a
tooth
of
the
shark
which
bit
him
off
the
coast
of
china
spears
knives
and
guns
lined
the
walls
every
inch
of
the
floor
was
covered
by
skins
his
flat
was
typical
of
the
man
a
man
who
had
done
things
introduce
him
to
me
commanded
jocelyn
where
is
he
she
looked
up
suddenly
and
saw
him
entering
the
ballroom
he
was
of
commanding
height
and
his
face
was
the
face
of
the
man
who
has
been
exposed
to
the
forces
of
nature
the
wind
the
waves
the
sun
the
mosquito
had
set
their
mark
upon
him
down
one
side
of
his
cheek
was
a
newly
healed
scar
a
scratch
from
a
hippopotamus
in
its
last
a
legacy
from
a
bison
seared
his
brow
he
walked
with
the
soft
easy
tread
of
the
python
or
the
pathan
or
some
animal
with
a
pth
in
it
probably
i
mean
the
panther
he
bore
himself
confidently
and
his
mouth
was
a
trap
from
which
no
superfluous
word
escaped
he
was
the
strong
silent
man
of
jocelyn
dreams
worrall
brice
miss
montrevor
said
freddy
and
left
them
worrall
brice
bowed
and
stood
beside
her
with
folded
arms
his
gaze
fixed
above
her
head
i
shall
not
expect
you
to
dance
said
jocelyn
with
a
confidential
smile
which
implied
that
he
and
she
were
above
such
frivolities
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
could
have
taught
her
the
the
bimbo
the
kiyi
the
the
hug
and
many
other
cannibalistic
steps
which
later
on
were
to
become
the
rage
of
london
and
the
basis
of
a
revue
i
have
often
imagined
you
as
you
kept
watch
over
your
camp
she
went
on
and
i
have
seemed
myself
to
hear
the
savages
and
lions
roaring
outside
the
circle
of
fire
what
time
in
the
swamps
the
crocodiles
were
barking
yes
he
said
it
must
be
a
wonderful
life
yes
if
i
were
a
man
i
should
want
to
lead
such
a
life
to
get
away
from
all
this
and
she
waved
her
hand
round
the
room
back
to
nature
to
know
that
i
could
not
eat
until
i
had
first
killed
my
dinner
that
i
could
not
live
unless
i
slew
the
enemy
that
must
be
fine
yes
said
worrall
i
ca
get
freddy
to
see
it
he
is
quite
content
to
have
shot
a
few
grouse
and
once
to
have
wounded
a
beater
there
must
be
more
in
life
than
that
yes
i
suppose
i
am
elemental
beneath
the
veneer
of
civilisation
i
am
a
savage
to
wake
up
with
the
of
the
enemy
in
my
ears
to
sleep
with
the
er
barking
of
the
crocodile
in
my
dreams
that
is
life
worrall
brice
tugged
at
his
moustache
and
gazed
into
space
over
her
head
then
he
spoke
crocodiles
do
bark
he
said
jocelyn
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
but
in
your
book
trackless
she
cried
i
know
it
almost
by
heart
it
was
you
who
taught
me
what
are
the
beautiful
words
the
banks
of
the
sleepy
river
two
great
crocodiles
were
barking
not
said
worrall
it
was
a
misprint
oh
said
jocelyn
she
had
a
moment
awful
memory
of
all
the
occasions
when
she
had
insisted
that
crocodiles
barked
there
had
been
a
particularly
fierce
argument
with
meta
richards
who
had
refused
to
weigh
even
the
printed
word
of
worrall
brice
against
the
silence
of
the
reptile
house
on
her
last
visit
to
the
zoo
well
smiled
jocelyn
you
must
teach
me
about
these
things
will
you
come
and
see
me
yes
said
worrall
he
rather
liked
to
stand
and
gaze
into
the
distance
while
pretty
women
talked
to
him
and
jocelyn
was
very
pretty
we
live
in
south
kensington
come
on
sunday
wo
you
peele
crescent
yes
said
worrall
on
sunday
jocelyn
waited
eagerly
for
him
in
the
of
peele
crescent
her
father
was
asleep
in
the
library
her
mother
was
dead
so
she
would
have
the
great
man
to
herself
for
an
afternoon
later
she
would
have
him
for
always
for
she
meant
to
marry
him
and
when
they
were
married
she
was
not
so
sure
that
they
would
live
with
the
noise
of
the
crocodile
barking
or
coughing
or
whatever
it
did
in
their
ears
she
saw
herself
in
that
little
house
in
green
street
with
the
noise
of
and
to
soothe
her
to
sleep
yet
what
a
man
he
was
what
had
he
said
to
her
she
went
over
all
his
words
they
were
not
many
at
six
she
was
still
waiting
in
the
at
peele
crescent
at
worrall
brice
had
got
as
far
as
peele
place
at
he
was
back
in
peele
square
again
at
seven
just
as
he
was
giving
himself
up
for
lost
he
met
a
taxi
and
returned
to
james
street
he
was
a
great
traveller
but
south
kensington
had
been
too
much
for
him
next
week
he
went
back
unmarried
to
the
jungle
it
was
the
narrowest
escape
he
had
had
lvi
the
newspaper
proprietor
the
great
hector
strong
lord
of
journalism
and
swayer
of
empires
paced
the
floor
of
his
luxurious
apartment
with
bowed
head
his
corrugated
countenance
furrowed
with
lines
of
anxiety
he
had
just
returned
from
a
lunch
with
all
his
favourite
advertisers
but
it
was
not
this
which
troubled
him
he
was
thinking
out
a
new
policy
for
daily
suddenly
he
remembered
something
coming
up
to
town
in
his
third
motor
he
had
glanced
through
the
nineteen
periodicals
which
his
house
had
published
that
morning
and
in
one
case
had
noted
matter
for
serious
criticism
this
was
obviously
the
first
business
he
must
deal
with
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
and
pushed
the
bell
marked
instantly
a
footman
presented
himself
with
a
tray
of
sandwiches
what
do
you
want
said
strong
coldly
you
rang
for
me
sir
replied
the
trembling
menial
go
away
said
strong
recognising
magnanimously
however
that
the
mistake
was
his
own
he
pressed
bell
in
another
moment
the
editor
of
was
before
him
in
number
said
strong
as
he
toyed
with
a
blue
pencil
you
apologise
for
a
mistake
in
last
week
number
he
waited
sternly
it
was
a
very
bad
mistake
sir
i
afraid
we
did
a
great
injustice
to
you
know
my
rule
said
strong
the
mistake
of
last
week
i
could
have
overlooked
the
apology
of
this
week
is
a
more
serious
matter
you
will
ask
for
a
month
salary
on
your
way
out
he
pressed
a
button
and
the
editor
disappeared
through
the
alone
again
hector
strong
thought
keenly
for
a
moment
then
he
pressed
bell
instantly
a
footman
presented
himself
with
a
tray
of
sandwiches
what
do
you
mean
by
this
roared
strong
his
iron
for
a
moment
giving
way
i
your
pardon
sir
stammered
the
man
i
get
out
as
the
footman
retired
strong
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
my
memory
is
bad
he
murmured
and
pushed
bell
a
tall
thin
man
entered
ah

said
the
proprietor
he
toyed
with
his
blue
pencil
let
me
see
which
of
our
papers

under
your
charge
at
the
moment
brownlow
reflected
just
now
he
said

little
while

congratulate

alone
hector
strong
lord
of
journalism
and
swayer
of
empires
resumed
his
pacings
his
two
mistakes
with
the
bell
told
him
that
he
was
distinctly
not
himself
this
afternoon
was
it
only
the
need
of
a
new
policy
for
which
troubled
him
or
was
it
could
it
be
lady
dorothy
lady
dorothy
neal
was
something
of
an
enigma
to
hector
strong
he
was
making
more
than
a
million
pounds
a
year
and
yet
she
did
not
want
to
marry
him
sometimes
he
wondered
if
the
woman
were
quite
sane
yet
mad
or
sane
he
loved
her
a
secretary
knocked
and
entered
he
waited
submissively
for
until
the
proprietor
looked
up
well
lady
dorothy
neal
would
like
to
see
you
for
a
moment
sir
show
her
in
lady
dorothy
came
in
brightly
what
men
you
have
here
she
said
who
is
the
one
in
the
blue
waistcoat
he
has
curly
hair
you
did
come
to
talk
about
said
hector
reproachfully
i
did
come
to
talk
him
really
but
if
you
keep
me
waiting
why
what
are
you
doing
strong
looked
up
from
the
note
he
was
writing
the
tender
lines
had
gone
from
his
face
and
he
had
become
the
stern
man
of
action
again
i
am
giving
instructions
that
the
services
of
my
commissionaire
and
fifth
secretary
will
no
longer
be
required
do
do
that
pleaded
dorothy
strong
tore
up
the
note
and
turned
to
her
what
do
you
want
of
me
he
asked
she
blushed
and
looked
down
i
i
have
written
a
a
play
she
faltered
he
smiled
indulgently
he
did
not
write
plays
himself
but
he
knew
that
other
people
did
when
does
it
come
off
he
asked
the
manager
says
it
will
have
to
at
the
end
of
the
week
it
came
a
week
ago
well
he
smiled
if
people
do
want
to
go
i
ca
make
them
yes
you
can
she
said
boldly
he
gave
a
start
his
brain
working
at
lightning
speed
saw
the
possibilities
in
an
instant
at
one
stroke
he
could
win
lady
gratitude
provide
daily
with
a
temporary
policy
and
give
a
convincing
exhibition
of
the
power
of
his
press
oh
strong
hector
he
whispered
as
he
rose
from
his
desk
to
go
to
her
he
accidentally
pressed
the
button
of
the
the
next
moment
he
was
alone
that
the
british
public
is
always
ready
to
welcome
the
advent
of
a
clean
and
wholesome
play
is
shown
by
the
startling
success
of
which
is
attracting
such
crowds
to
the
every
night
so
wrote
daily
and
continued
in
the
same
strain
for
a
column
clubland
is
keenly
exercised
wrote
evening
over
a
problem
of
etiquette
which
arises
in
the
second
act
of
the
great
autumn
success
at
the
king
theatre
the
point
is
shortly
this
should
a
woman
and
so
on
a
pretty
story
is
going
the
rounds
said
anent
that
charming
little
lady
estelle
rito
who
plays
the
part
of
a
governess
in
for
which
manager
barodo
informs
me
advance
booking
up
to
christmas
has
already
been
taken
it
seems
that
miss
rito
when
shopping
in
the
purlieus
of
bond
street
had
a
joke
which
set
all
the
world
laughing
it
was
called
the
who
the
lady
in
the
box
with
johnson
hush
it
his
wife
and
flossie
giggled
so
much
that
she
could
hardly
listen
to
the
last
act
of
which
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
for
weeks
the
offered
free
tickets
to
a
hundred
unmarried
suburban
girls
to
which
class
might
be
supposed
to
make
a
special
religious
appeal
but
they
had
to
collect
coupons
first
for
sunday
and
finally
of
two
months
later
said
a
marriage
has
been
arranged
between
lady
dorothy
neal
daughter
of
the
earl
of
skye
and
the
hon
geoffrey
bollinger
than
a
successful
revenge
nothing
is
sweeter
in
life
hector
strong
was
not
the
man
to
spare
any
one
who
had
done
him
an
injury
yet
i
think
his
method
of
revenging
himself
upon
lady
dorothy
savoured
of
the
diabolical
he
printed
a
photograph
of
her
in
daily
picture
it
was
headed
the
beautiful
lady
dorothy
neal
the
end
transcriber
notes
simple
and
obvious
errors
corrected
the
hyphenation
or
not
of
several
words
appears
to
have
changed
over
the
nine
year
period
in
which
these
stories
were
written
these
include

businesslike
halfway

today
tomorrow
and

the

have
been
left
in
their
original
state
