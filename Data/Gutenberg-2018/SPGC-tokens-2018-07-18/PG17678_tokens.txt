the
apology
of
the
church
of
england
by
john
jewel
of
cassell
company
limited
york
introduction
the
great
interest
of
jewel
apology
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
was
written
in
latin
to
be
read
throughout
europe
as
the
answer
of
the
reformed
church
of
england
at
the
beginning
of
queen
elizabeth
reign
to
those
who
said
that
the
reformation
set
up
a
new
church
its
argument
was
that
the
english
church
reformers
were
going
back
to
the
old
church
not
setting
up
a
new
and
this
jewel
proposed
to
show
by
looking
back
to
the
first
centuries
of
christianity
innovation
was
imputed
and
an
apology
originally
meant
a
pleading
to
rebut
an
imputation
so
even
as
late
as
there
was
a
book
called
an
apology
for
the
bible
meaning
its
defence
against
those
who
questioned
its
authority
this
latin
book
of
jewel
ecclesiae
written
in
latin
because
it
was
not
addressed
to
england
only
was
first
published
in
and
translated
into
english
by
the
mother
of
francis
bacon

edition
appeared
in
that
is
the
translation
given
in
this
volume
the
book
has
since
had
six
or
seven
other
translators
but
lady
ann
translation
was
that
which
presented
it
in
queen
elizabeth
time
to
english
readers
and
it
had
the
advantage
of
revision
by
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
her
coadjutor
in
the
establishment
of
the
reformed
church
of
england
matthew
parker
it
was
published
with

of
the
churche
of
englande
with
a
briefe
and
plaine
declaration
of
the
true
religion
professed
or
used

prefaced
by

had
made
her

whose
judgment

her
book
had
singularly
pleased

the
second

of
the
lord

sir
nicholas

their
father
had
made
mildred
and
ann
two
of
the
most
learned
women
in
england
john
jewel
was
forty
years
old
when
he
wrote
the
apology
he
was
born
in
devonshire
in
on
the
of
may
at
the
village
of
buden
near

he
studied

was
presented
to
the
rectory
of
sunningwell
at
the
accession
of
queen
mary
he
bowed
to
the
royal
authority
but
he
was
a
warm
friend
and
disciple
of
peter
martyr
who
had
come
to
england
in
at
the
invitation
of
edward
to
take
the
chair
of

returned
to
strasburg
and
went
thence
to
zurich
where
he
died
in
jewel
repenting
of
his
assent
to
the
new
sovereign
authority
in
matters
of
religion
followed
his
friend
peter
martyr
across
the
water
and
became
of
a
college
at
strasburg
upon
the
accession
of
elizabeth
in
jewel
came
back
and
he
was
one
of
the
sixteen
protestants
appointed
by
the
queen
to
dispute
before
her
with
a
like
number
of
catholics
in
john
jewel
was
appointed
a
commissioner
for
securing
in
the
west
of
england
conformity
with
the
church
service
and
he
had
to
see
that
the
queen
orders
were
obeyed
in
the
churches
of
his
native
county
before
the
end
of
the
same
year
he
was
consecrated
bishop
of
salisbury
he
was
most
zealous
in
performance
of
all
duties
of
his
charge
to
his
good
offices
young
richard
hooker
owed
his
opportunity
of
training
for
the
service
of
the
church
among
jewel
writings
this
apology
or
defence
of
the
church
of
england
was
the
most
important
but
he
worked
incessantly
and
shortened
his
life
by
limiting
himself
to
four
hours
of
sleep
taken
between
midnight
and
four
in
the
morning
bishop
jewel
died
on
the
of
september
before
he
had
reached
the
age
of
fifty
an
apology
or
answer
in
defence
of
the
church
of
england
a
brief
and
plain
declaration
of
the
true
religion
professed
and
used
in
the
part
i
it
hath
been
an
old
complaint
even
from
the
first
time
of
the
patriarchs
and
prophets
and
confirmed
by
the
writings
and
testimonies
of
every
age
that
the
truth
wandereth
here
and
there
as
a
stranger
in
the
world
and
doth
readily
find
enemies
and
slanderers
amongst
those
that
know
her
not
albeit
perchance
this
may
seem
unto
some
a
thing
hard
to
be
believed
i
mean
to
such
as
have
scant
well
and
narrowly
taken
heed
thereunto
specially
seeing
all
mankind
of
nature
very
motion
without
a
teacher
doth
covet
the
truth
of
their
own
accord
and
seeing
our
saviour
christ
himself
when
he
was
on
earth
would
be
called
the
truth
as
by
a
name
most
fit
to
express
all
his
divine
power
yet
we
which
have
been
exercised
in
the
holy
scriptures
and
which
have
both
read
and
seen
what
hath
happened
to
all
godly
men
commonly
at
all
times
what
to
the
prophets
to
the
apostles
to
the
holy
martyrs
and
what
to
christ
himself
with
what
rebukes
revilings
and
despites
they
were
continually
vexed
whiles
they
here
lived
and
that
only
for
the
truth
sake
we
i
say
do
see
that
this
is
not
only
no
new
thing
or
hard
to
be
believed
but
that
it
is
a
thing
already
received
and
commonly
used
from
age
to
age
nay
truly
this
might
seem
much
rather
a
marvel
and
beyond
all
belief
if
the
devil
who
is
the
father
of
lies
and
enemy
to
all
truth
would
now
upon
a
sudden
change
his
nature
and
hope
that
truth
might
otherwise
be
suppressed
than
by
belying
it
or
that
he
would
begin
to
establish
his
own
kingdom
by
using
now
any
other
practices
than
the
same
which
he
hath
ever
used
from
the
beginning
for
since
any
remembrance
we
can
scant
find
one
time
either
when
religion
did
first
grow
or
when
it
was
settled
or
when
it
did
afresh
spring
up
again
wherein
truth
and
innocency
were
not
by
all
unworthy
means
and
most
despitefully
intreated
doubtless
the
devil
well
seeth
that
so
long
as
truth
is
in
good
safety
himself
can
not
be
safe
nor
yet
maintain
his
own
estate
for
letting
pass
the
ancient
patriarchs
and
prophets
who
as
we
have
said
had
no
part
of
their
life
free
from
contumelies
and
slanders
we
know
there
were
certain
in
times
past
which
said
and
commonly
preached
that
the
old
ancient
jews
of
whom
we
make
no
doubt
but
they
were
the
worshippers
of
the
only
and
true
god
did
worship
either
a
sow
or
an
ass
in
god
stead
and
that
all
the
same
religion
was
nothing
else
but
a
sacrilege
and
a
plain
contempt
of
all
godliness
we
know
also
that
the
son
of
god
our
saviour
jesu
christ
when
he
taught
the
truth
was
counted
a
juggler
and
an
enchanter
a
samaritan
beelzebub
a
deceiver
of
the
people
a
drunkard
and
a
glutton
again
who
wotteth
not
what
words
were
spoken
against
paul
the
most
earnest
and
vehement
preacher
and
maintainer
of
the
truth
sometime
that
he
was
a
seditious
and
busy
man
a
raiser
of
tumults
a
causer
of
rebellion
sometime
again
that
he
was
an
heretic
sometime
that
he
was
mad
sometime
that
only
upon
strife
and
stomach
he
was
both
a
blasphemer
of
god
law
and
a
despiser
of
the
fathers
ordinances
further
who
knoweth
not
how
stephen
after
he
had
thoroughly
and
sincerely
embraced
the
truth
and
began
frankly
and
stoutly
to
preach
and
set
forth
the
same
as
he
ought
to
do
was
immediately
called
to
answer
for
his
life
as
one
that
had
wickedly
uttered
disdainful
and
heinous
words
against
the
law
against
moses
against
the
temple
and
against
god
or
who
is
ignorant
that
in
times
past
there
were
some
which
reproved
the
holy
scripts
of
falsehood
saying
they
contained
things
both
contrary
and
quite
one
against
other
and
how
that
the
apostles
of
christ
did
severally
disagree
between
themselves
and
that
paul
did
vary
from
them
all
and
not
to
make
rehearsal
of
all
for
that
were
an
endless
labour
who
knoweth
not
after
what
sort
our
fathers
were
railed
upon
in
times
past
which
first
began
to
acknowledge
and
profess
the
name
of
christ
how
they
made
private
conspiracies
devised
secret
counsels
against
the
commonwealth
and
that
end
made
early
and
privy
meetings
in
the
dark
killed
young
babes
fed
themselves
with
men
flesh
and
like
savage
and
brute
beasts
did
drink
their
blood
in
conclusion
how
that
after
they
had
put
out
the
candles
they
committed
adultery
between
themselves
and
without
regard
wrought
incest
one
with
another
that
brethren
lay
with
their
sisters
sons
with
their
mothers
without
any
reverence
of
nature
or
kin
without
shame
without
difference
and
that
they
were
wicked
men
without
all
care
of
religion
and
without
any
opinion
of
god
being
the
very
enemies
of
mankind
unworthy
to
be
suffered
in
the
world
and
unworthy
of
life
all
these
things
were
spoken
in
those
days
against
the
people
of
god
against
christ
jesu
against
paul
against
stephen
and
against
all
them
whosoever
they
were
which
at
the
first
beginning
embraced
the
truth
of
the
gospel
and
were
contented
to
be
called
by
the
name
of
christians
which
was
then
a
hateful
name
among
the
common
people
and
although
the
things
which
they
said
were
not
true
yet
the
devil
thought
it
should
be
sufficient
for
him
if
at
the
least
he
could
bring
it
so
to
pass
as
they
might
be
believed
for
true
and
that
the
christians
might
be
brought
into
a
common
hatred
of
everybody
and
have
their
death
and
destruction
sought
of
all
sorts
hereupon
kings
and
princes
being
led
then
by
such
persuasions
killed
all
the
prophets
of
god
letting
none
escape
esay
with
a
saw
jeremy
with
stones
daniel
with
lions
amos
with
an
iron
bar
paul
with
the
sword
and
christ
upon
the
cross
and
condemned
all
christians
to
imprisonments
to
torments
to
the
pikes
to
be
thrown
down
headlong
from
rocks
and
steep
places
to
be
cast
to
wild
beasts
and
to
be
burnt
and
made
great
fires
of
their
quick
bodies
for
the
only
purpose
to
give
light
by
night
and
for
a
very
scorn
and
mocking
stock
and
did
count
them
no
better
than
the
vilest
filth
the
offscourings
and
laughing
games
of
the
whole
world
thus
as
ye
see
have
the
authors
and
professors
of
the
truth
ever
been
intreated
wherefore
we
ought
to
bear
it
the
more
quietly
which
have
taken
upon
us
to
profess
the
gospel
of
christ
if
we
for
the
same
cause
be
handled
after
the
same
sort
and
if
we
as
our
forefathers
were
long
ago
be
likewise
at
this
day
tormented
and
baited
with
railings
with
spiteful
dealings
and
with
lies
and
that
for
no
desert
of
our
own
but
only
because
we
teach
and
acknowledge
the
truth
they
cry
out
upon
us
at
this
present
everywhere
that
we
are
all
heretics
and
have
forsaken
the
faith
and
have
with
new
persuasions
and
wicked
learning
utterly
dissolved
the
concord
of
the
church
that
we
renew
and
as
it
were
fetch
again
from
hell
the
old
and
many
a
day
condemned
heresies
that
we
sow
abroad
new
sects
and
such
broils
as
never
yearst
were
heard
of
also
that
we
are
already
divided
into
contrary
parts
and
opinions
and
could
yet
by
no
means
agree
well
among
ourselves
that
we
be
cursed
creatures
and
like
the
giants
do
war
against
god
himself
and
live
clean
without
any
regard
or
worshipping
of
god
that
we
despise
all
good
deeds
that
we
use
no
discipline
of
virtue
no
laws
no
customs
that
we
esteem
neither
right
nor
order
nor
equity
nor
justice
that
we
give
the
bridle
to
all
naughtiness
and
provoke
the
people
to
all
licentiousness
and
lust
that
we
labour
and
seek
to
overthrow
the
state
of
monarchies
and
kingdoms
and
to
bring
all
things
under
the
rule
of
the
rash
inconstant
people
and
unlearned
multitude
that
we
have
seditiously
fallen
from
the
catholic
church
and
by
a
wicked
schism
and
division
have
shaken
the
whole
world
and
troubled
the
common
peace
and
universal
quiet
of
the
church
and
that
as
dathan
and
abiram
conspired
in
times
past
against
moses
and
aaron
even
so
we
at
this
day
have
renounced
the
bishop
of
rome
without
any
cause
reasonable
that
we
set
nought
by
the
authority
of
the
ancient
fathers
and
councils
of
old
time
that
we
have
rashly
and
presumptuously
disannulled
the
old
ceremonies
which
have
been
well
allowed
by
our
fathers
and
forefathers
many
hundred
years
past
both
by
good
customs
and
also
in
ages
of
more
purity
and
that
we
have
by
our
own
private
head
without
the
authority
of
any
sacred
and
general
council
brought
new
traditions
into
the
church
and
have
done
all
these
things
not
for
religion
sake
but
only
upon
a
desire
of
contention
and
strife
but
that
they
for
their
part
have
changed
no
manner
of
thing
but
have
held
and
kept
still
such
a
number
of
years
to
this
very
day
all
things
as
they
were
delivered
from
the
apostles
and
well
approved
by
the
most
ancient
fathers
and
that
this
matter
should
not
seem
to
be
done
but
upon
privy
slander
and
to
be
tossed
to
and
fro
in
a
corner
only
to
spite
us
there
have
been
besides
wilily
procured
by
the
bishop
of
rome
certain
persons
of
eloquence
enough
and
not
unlearned
neither
which
should
put
their
help
to
this
cause
now
almost
despaired
of
and
should
polish
and
set
forth
the
same
both
in
books
and
with
long
tales
to
the
end
that
when
the
matter
was
trimly
and
eloquently
handled
ignorant
and
unskilful
persons
might
suspect
there
was
some
great
thing
in
it
indeed
they
perceived
that
their
own
cause
did
everywhere
go
to
wrack
that
their
sleights
were
now
espied
and
less
esteemed
and
that
their
helps
did
daily
fail
them
and
that
their
matter
stood
altogether
in
great
need
of
a
cunning
spokesman
now
as
for
those
things
which
by
them
have
been
laid
against
us
in
part
they
be
manifestly
false
and
condemned
so
by
their
own
judgments
which
spake
them
partly
again
though
they
be
as
false
too
indeed
yet
bear
they
a
certain
show
and
colour
of
truth
so
as
the
reader
if
he
take
not
good
heed
may
easily
be
tripped
and
brought
into
error
by
them
specially
when
their
fine
and
cunning
tale
is
added
thereunto
and
part
of
them
be
of
such
sort
as
we
ought
not
to
shun
them
as
crimes
or
faults
but
to
acknowledge
and
profess
them
as
things
well
done
and
upon
very
good
reason
for
shortly
to
say
the
truth
these
folk
falsely
accuse
and
slander
all
our
doings
yea
the
same
things
which
they
themselves
can
not
deny
but
to
be
rightly
and
orderly
done
and
for
malice
do
so
misconstrue
and
deprave
all
our
sayings
and
doings
as
though
it
were
impossible
that
anything
could
be
rightly
spoken
or
done
by
us
they
should
more
plainly
and
sincerely
have
gone
to
work
if
they
would
have
dealt
truly
but
now
they
neither
truly
nor
sincerely
nor
yet
christianly
but
darkly
and
craftily
charge
and
batter
us
with
lies
and
do
abuse
the
blindness
and
fondness
of
the
people
together
with
the
ignorance
of
princes
to
cause
us
to
be
hated
and
the
truth
to
be
suppressed
this
lo
ye
is
the
power
of
darkness
and
of
men
which
lean
more
to
the
amazed
wondering
of
the
rude
multitude
and
to
darkness
than
they
do
to
truth
and
light
and
as
hierom
saith
which
do
openly
gainsay
the
truth
closing
up
their
eyes
and
will
not
see
for
the
nonce
but
we
give
thanks
to
the
most
good
and
mighty
god
that
such
is
our
cause
whereagainst
when
they
would
fainest
they
were
able
to
utter
no
despite
but
the
same
which
might
as
well
be
wrested
against
the
holy
fathers
against
the
prophets
against
the
apostles
against
peter
against
paul
and
against
christ
himself
now
therefore
if
it
be
lawful
for
these
folks
to
be
eloquent
and
tongued
in
speaking
evil
surely
it
becometh
not
us
in
our
cause
being
so
very
good
to
be
dumb
in
answering
truly
for
men
to
be
careless
what
is
spoken
by
them
and
their
own
matter
be
it
never
so
falsely
and
slanderously
spoken
especially
when
it
is
such
that
the
majesty
of
god
and
the
cause
of
religion
may
thereby
be
damaged
is
the
part
doubtless
of
dissolute
and
wretchless
persons
and
of
them
which
wickedly
wink
at
the
injuries
done
unto
the
name
of
god
for
although
other
wrongs
yea
oftentimes
great
may
be
borne
and
dissembled
of
a
mild
and
christian
man
yet
he
that
goeth
smoothly
away
and
dissembleth
the
matter
when
he
is
noted
of
heresy
ruffinus
was
wont
to
deny
that
man
to
be
a
christian
we
therefore
will
do
the
same
thing
which
all
laws
which
nature
own
voice
doth
command
to
be
done
and
which
christ
himself
did
in
like
case
when
he
was
checked
and
reviled
to
the
intent
we
may
put
off
from
us
these
men
slanderous
accusations
and
may
defend
soberly
and
truly
our
own
cause
and
innocency
for
christ
verily
when
the
pharisees
charged
him
with
sorcery
as
one
that
had
some
familiar
spirits
and
wrought
many
things
by
their
help
i
said
he
have
not
the
devil
but
do
glorify
my
father
but
it
is
you
that
have
dishonoured
me
and
put
me
to
rebuke
and
shame
and
paul
when
festus
the
lieutenant
scorned
him
as
a
madman
i
said
he
most
dear
festus
am
not
mad
as
thou
thinkest
but
i
speak
the
words
of
truth
and
soberness
and
the
ancient
christians
when
they
were
slandered
to
the
people
for
mankillers
for
adulterers
for
committers
of
incest
for
disturbers
of
the
commonweals
and
did
perceive
that
by
such
slanderous
accusations
the
religion
which
they
professed
might
be
brought
in
question
namely
if
they
should
seem
to
hold
their
peace
and
in
manner
to
confess
the
fault
lest
this
might
hinder
the
free
course
of
the
gospel
they
made
orations
they
put
up
supplications
and
made
means
to
emperors
and
princes
that
they
might
defend
themselves
and
their
fellows
in
open
audience
but
we
truly
seeing
that
so
many
thousands
of
our
brethren
in
these
last
twenty
years
have
borne
witness
unto
the
truth
in
the
midst
of
most
painful
torments
that
could
be
devised
and
when
princes
desirous
to
restrain
the
gospel
sought
many
ways
but
prevailed
nothing
and
that
now
almost
the
whole
world
doth
begin
to
open
their
eyes
to
behold
the
light
we
take
it
that
our
cause
hath
already
been
sufficiently
declared
and
defended
and
think
it
not
needful
to
make
many
words
seeing
the
matter
saith
enough
for
itself
for
if
the
popes
would
or
else
if
they
could
weigh
with
their
own
selves
the
whole
matter
and
also
the
beginnings
and
proceedings
of
our
religion
how
in
a
manner
all
their
travail
hath
come
to
nought
nobody
driving
it
forward
and
how
on
the
other
side
our
cause
against
the
will
of
emperors
from
the
beginning
against
the
wills
of
so
many
kings
in
spite
of
the
popes
and
almost
maugre
the
head
of
all
men
hath
taken
increase
and
by
little
and
little
spread
over
into
all
countries
and
is
come
at
length
even
into
courts
and
palaces
these
same
things
methinketh
might
be
tokens
great
enough
to
them
that
god
himself
doth
strongly
fight
in
our
quarrel
and
doth
from
heaven
laugh
at
their
enterprises
and
that
the
force
of
truth
is
such
as
neither
man
power
nor
yet
are
able
to
root
it
out
for
they
be
not
all
mad
at
this
day
so
many
free
cities
so
many
kings
so
many
princes
which
have
fallen
away
from
the
seat
of
rome
and
have
rather
joined
themselves
to
the
gospel
of
christ
and
although
the
popes
had
never
hitherunto
leisure
to
consider
diligently
and
earnestly
of
these
matters
or
though
some
other
cares
do
now
let
them
and
diverse
ways
pull
them
or
though
they
count
these
to
be
but
common
and
trifling
studies
and
nothing
to
appertain
to
the
pope
worthiness
this
maketh
not
why
our
matter
ought
to
seem
the
worse
or
if
they
perchance
will
not
see
that
which
they
see
indeed
but
rather
will
withstand
the
known
truth
ought
we
therefore
to
be
accounted
heretics
because
we
obey
not
their
will
and
pleasure
if
so
be
that
pope
pius
were
the
man
we
say
not
which
he
would
so
gladly
be
called
but
if
he
were
indeed
a
man
that
either
would
account
us
for
his
brethren
or
at
least
would
take
us
to
be
men
he
would
first
diligently
have
examined
our
reasons
and
would
have
seen
what
might
be
said
with
us
what
against
us
and
would
not
in
his
bull
whereby
he
lately
pretended
a
council
so
rashly
have
condemned
so
great
a
part
of
the
world
so
many
learned
and
godly
men
so
many
commonwealths
so
many
kings
and
so
many
princes
only
upon
his
own
blind
prejudices
and
determinations
and
that
without
hearing
of
them
speak
or
without
showing
cause
why
but
because
he
hath
already
so
noted
us
openly
lest
by
holding
our
peace
we
should
seem
to
grant
a
fault
and
specially
because
we
can
by
no
means
have
audience
in
the
public
assembly
of
the
general
council
wherein
he
would
no
creature
should
have
power
to
give
his
voice
or
to
declare
his
opinion
except
he
be
sworn
and
straitly
bound
to
maintain
his
authority
for
we
have
had
good
experience
hereof
in
the
last
conference
at
the
council
at
trident
where
the
ambassadors
and
divines
of
the
princes
of
germany
and
of
the
free
cities
were
quite
shut
out
from
their
company
neither
can
we
yet
forget
how
julius
the
third
above
ten
years
past
provided
warily
by
his
writ
that
none
of
our
sort
should
be
suffered
to
speak
in
the
council
except
that
there
were
some
peradventure
that
would
recant
and
change
his
opinion
for
this
cause
chiefly
we
thought
it
good
to
yield
up
an
account
of
our
faith
in
writing
and
truly
and
openly
to
make
answer
to
those
things
wherewith
we
have
been
openly
charged
to
the
end
the
world
may
see
the
parts
and
foundations
of
that
doctrine
in
the
behalf
whereof
so
many
good
men
have
little
regarded
their
own
lives
and
that
all
men
may
understand
what
manner
of
people
they
be
and
what
opinion
they
have
of
god
and
of
religion
whom
the
bishop
of
rome
before
they
were
called
to
tell
their
tale
hath
condemned
for
heretics
without
any
good
consideration
without
any
example
and
utterly
without
law
or
right
only
because
he
heard
tell
that
they
did
dissent
from
him
and
his
in
some
point
of
religion
and
although
hierom
would
have
nobody
to
be
patient
when
he
is
suspected
of
heresy
yet
we
will
deal
herein
neither
bitterly
nor
brablingly
nor
yet
be
carried
away
with
anger
and
heat
though
he
ought
to
be
reckoned
neither
bitter
nor
brabler
that
speaketh
the
truth
we
willingly
leave
this
kind
of
eloquence
to
our
adversaries
who
whatsoever
they
say
against
us
be
it
never
so
shrewdly
or
despitefully
said
yet
think
it
is
said
modestly
and
comely
enough
and
care
nothing
whether
it
be
true
or
false
we
need
none
of
these
shifts
which
do
maintain
the
truth
further
if
we
do
show
it
plainly
that
god
holy
gospel
the
ancient
bishops
and
the
primitive
church
do
make
on
our
side
and
that
we
have
not
without
just
cause
left
these
men
and
rather
have
returned
to
the
apostles
and
old
catholic
fathers
and
if
we
shall
be
found
to
do
the
same
not
colourably
or
craftily
but
in
good
faith
before
god
truly
honestly
clearly
and
plainly
and
if
they
themselves
which
fly
our
doctrine
and
would
be
called
catholics
shall
manifestly
see
how
all
these
titles
of
antiquity
whereof
they
boast
so
much
are
quite
shaken
out
of
their
hands
and
that
there
is
more
pith
in
this
our
cause
than
they
thought
for
we
then
hope
and
trust
that
none
of
them
will
be
so
negligent
and
careless
of
his
own
salvation
but
he
will
at
length
study
and
bethink
himself
to
whether
part
he
were
best
to
join
him
undoubtedly
except
one
will
altogether
harden
his
heart
and
refuse
to
hear
he
shall
not
repent
him
to
give
good
heed
to
this
our
defence
and
to
mark
well
what
we
say
and
how
truly
and
justly
it
agreeth
with
christian
religion
for
where
they
call
us
heretics
it
is
a
crime
so
heinous
that
unless
it
may
be
seen
unless
it
may
be
felt
and
in
manner
may
be
holden
with
hands
and
fingers
it
ought
not
lightly
to
be
judged
or
believed
when
it
is
laid
to
the
charge
of
any
christian
man
for
heresy
is
a
forsaking
of
salvation
a
renouncing
of
god
grace
a
departing
from
the
body
and
spirit
of
christ
but
this
was
ever
an
old
and
solemn
property
with
them
and
their
forefathers
if
any
did
complain
of
their
errors
and
faults
and
desired
to
have
true
religion
restored
straightway
to
condemn
such
ones
for
heretics
as
men
and
factious
christ
for
no
other
cause
was
called
a
samaritan
but
only
for
that
he
was
thought
to
have
fallen
to
a
certain
new
religion
and
to
be
the
author
of
a
new
sect
and
paul
the
apostle
of
christ
was
called
before
the
judges
to
make
answer
to
a
matter
of
heresy
and
therefore
he
said
according
to
this
way
which
they
call
heresy
i
do
worship
the
god
of
my
fathers
believing
all
things
which
be
written
in
the
law
and
in
the
prophets
shortly
to
speak
this
universal
religion
which
christian
men
profess
at
this
day
was
called
first
of
the
heathen
people
a
sect
and
heresy
with
these
terms
did
they
always
fill
princes
ears
to
the
intent
when
they
had
once
hated
us
with
a
predetermined
opinion
and
had
counted
all
that
we
said
to
be
faction
and
heresy
they
might
be
so
led
away
from
the
truth
and
right
understanding
of
the
cause
but
the
more
sore
and
outrageous
a
crime
heresy
is
the
more
it
ought
to
be
proved
by
plain
and
strong
arguments
especially
in
this
time
when
men
begin
to
give
less
credit
to
their
words
and
to
make
more
diligent
search
of
their
doctrine
than
they
were
wont
to
do
for
the
people
of
god
are
otherwise
instructed
now
than
they
were
in
times
past
when
all
the
bishops
of
rome
sayings
were
allowed
for
gospel
and
when
all
religion
did
depend
only
upon
their
authority
nowadays
the
holy
scripture
is
abroad
the
writings
of
the
apostles
and
prophets
are
in
print
whereby
all
truth
and
catholic
doctrine
may
be
proved
and
all
heresy
may
be
disproved
and
confuted
sithence
then
they
bring
forth
none
of
these
for
themselves
and
call
us
nevertheless
heretics
which
have
neither
fallen
from
christ
nor
from
the
apostles
nor
yet
from
the
prophets
this
is
an
injurious
and
a
very
spiteful
dealing
with
this
sword
did
christ
put
off
the
devil
when
he
was
tempted
of
him
with
these
weapons
ought
all
presumption
which
doth
advance
itself
against
god
to
be
overthrown
and
conquered
for
all
scripture
saith
paul
that
cometh
by
the
inspiration
of
god
is
profitable
to
teach
to
confute
to
instruct
and
to
reprove
that
the
man
of
god
may
be
perfect
and
thoroughly
framed
to
every
good
work
thus
did
the
holy
fathers
always
fight
against
the
heretics
with
none
other
force
than
with
the
holy
scriptures
augustine
when
he
disputed
against
petilian
a
heretic
of
the
donatists
let
not
these
words
quoth
he
be
heard
between
us
say
or
you
say
let
us
rather
speak
in
this
wise
saith
the
lord
there
let
us
seek
the
church
there
let
us
boult
out
our
cause
likewise
hierom
all
those
things
saith
he
which
without
the
testimony
of
the
scriptures
are
holden
as
delivered
from
the
apostles
be
thoroughly
smitten
down
by
the
sword
of
god
word
ambrose
also
to
gratian
the
emperor
let
the
scripture
saith
he
be
asked
the
question
let
the
prophets
be
asked
and
let
christ
be
asked
for
at
that
time
made
the
catholic
fathers
and
bishops
no
doubt
but
that
our
religion
might
be
proved
out
of
the
holy
scriptures
neither
were
they
ever
so
hardy
as
to
take
any
for
a
heretic
whose
error
they
could
not
evidently
and
apparently
reprove
by
the
scriptures
and
we
verily
do
make
answer
on
this
wise
as
paul
did
according
to
this
way
which
they
call
heresy
we
do
worship
god
and
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
do
allow
all
things
which
have
been
written
either
in
the
law
or
in
the
prophets
or
in
the
apostles
works
wherefore
if
we
be
heretics
and
they
as
they
would
fain
be
called
be
catholics
why
do
they
not
as
they
see
the
fathers
which
were
catholic
men
have
always
done
why
do
they
not
convince
and
master
us
by
the
divine
scriptures
why
do
they
not
call
us
again
to
be
tried
by
them
why
do
they
not
lay
before
us
how
we
have
gone
away
from
christ
from
the
prophets
from
the
apostles
and
from
the
holy
fathers
why
stick
they
to
do
it
why
are
they
afraid
of
it
it
is
god
cause
why
are
they
doubtful
to
commit
it
to
the
trial
of
god
word
if
we
be
heretics
which
refer
all
our
controversies
unto
the
holy
scriptures
and
report
us
to
the
words
which
we
know
were
sealed
by
god
himself
and
in
comparison
of
them
set
little
by
all
other
things
whatsoever
may
be
devised
by
men
how
shall
we
say
to
these
folk
i
pray
you
what
manner
of
men
be
they
and
how
is
it
meet
to
call
them
which
fear
the
judgment
of
the
holy
scriptures
that
is
to
say
the
judgment
of
god
himself
and
do
prefer
before
them
their
own
dreams
and
full
cold
inventions
and
to
maintain
their
own
traditions
have
defaced
and
corrupted
now
these
many
hundred
years
the
ordinances
of
christ
and
of
the
apostles
men
say
that
sophocles
the
tragical
poet
when
in
his
old
days
he
was
by
his
own
sons
accused
before
the
judges
for
a
doting
and
sottish
man
as
one
that
fondly
wasted
his
own
substance
and
seemed
to
need
a
governor
to
see
unto
him
to
the
intent
he
might
clear
himself
of
the
fault
he
came
into
the
place
of
judgment
and
when
he
had
rehearsed
before
them
his
tragedy
called
which
he
had
written
at
the
very
time
of
his
accusation
marvellous
exactly
and
cunningly
did
of
himself
ask
the
judges
whether
they
thought
any
sottish
or
doting
man
could
do
the
like
piece
of
work
in
like
manner
because
these
men
take
us
to
be
mad
and
appeach
us
for
heretics
as
men
which
have
nothing
to
do
neither
with
christ
nor
with
the
church
of
god
we
have
judged
it
should
be
to
good
purpose
and
not
unprofitable
if
we
do
openly
and
frankly
set
forth
our
faith
wherein
we
stand
and
show
all
that
confidence
which
we
have
in
christ
jesu
to
the
intent
all
men
may
see
what
is
our
judgment
of
every
part
of
christian
religion
and
may
resolve
with
themselves
whether
the
faith
which
they
shall
see
confirmed
by
the
words
of
christ
by
the
writings
of
the
apostles
by
the
testimonies
of
the
catholic
fathers
and
by
the
examples
of
many
ages
be
but
a
certain
rage
of
furious
and
mad
men
and
a
conspiracy
of
heretics
this
therefore
is
our
belief
part
ii
we
believe
that
there
is
one
certain
nature
and
divine
power
which
we
call
god
and
that
the
same
is
divided
into
three
equal
persons
into
the
father
into
the
son
and
into
the
holy
ghost
and
that
they
all
be
of
one
power
of
one
majesty
of
one
eternity
of
one
godhead
and
of
one
substance
and
although
these
three
persons
be
so
divided
that
neither
the
father
is
the
son
nor
the
son
is
the
holy
ghost
or
the
father
yet
nevertheless
we
believe
that
there
is
but
one
very
god
and
that
the
same
one
god
hath
created
heaven
and
earth
and
all
things
contained
under
heaven
we
believe
that
jesus
christ
the
only
son
of
the
eternal
father
as
long
before
it
was
determined
before
all
beginnings
when
the
fulness
of
time
was
come
did
take
of
that
blessed
and
pure
virgin
both
flesh
and
all
the
nature
of
man
that
he
might
declare
to
the
world
the
secret
and
hid
will
of
his
father
which
will
had
been
laid
up
from
before
all
ages
and
generations
and
that
he
might
full
finish
in
his
human
body
the
mystery
of
our
redemption
and
might
fasten
our
sins
to
the
cross
and
also
that
handwriting
which
was
made
against
us
we
believe
that
for
our
sakes
he
died
and
was
buried
descended
into
hell
the
third
day
by
the
power
of
his
godhead
returned
to
life
and
rose
again
and
that
the
fortieth
day
after
his
resurrection
whiles
his
disciples
beheld
and
looked
upon
him
he
ascended
into
heaven
to
fulfil
all
things
and
did
place
in
majesty
and
glory
the
body
wherewith
he
was
born
wherein
he
lived
on
earth
wherein
he
was
jested
at
wherein
he
had
suffered
most
painful
torments
and
cruel
kind
of
death
wherein
he
rose
again
and
wherein
he
ascended
to
the
right
hand
of
the
father
above
all
rule
above
all
power
all
force
all
dominion
and
above
every
name
that
is
named
not
only
in
this
world
but
also
in
the
world
to
come
and
that
there
he
now
sitteth
and
shall
sit
till
all
things
be
full
perfected
and
although
the
majesty
and
godhead
of
christ
be
everywhere
abundantly
dispersed
yet
we
believe
that
his
body
as
augustine
saith
must
needs
be
still
in
one
place
and
that
christ
hath
given
majesty
unto
his
body
but
yet
hath
not
taken
away
from
it
the
nature
of
a
body
and
that
we
must
not
so
affirm
christ
to
be
god
that
we
deny
him
to
be
man
and
as
the
martyr
vigilius
saith
that
christ
hath
left
us
as
touching
his
human
nature
but
hath
not
left
us
as
touching
his
divine
nature
and
that
the
same
christ
though
he
be
absent
from
us
concerning
his
manhood
yet
is
ever
present
with
us
concerning
his
godhead
from
that
place
also
we
believe
that
christ
shall
come
again
to
execute
that
general
judgment
as
well
of
them
whom
he
shall
then
find
alive
in
the
body
as
of
them
that
be
already
dead
we
believe
that
the
holy
ghost
who
is
the
third
person
in
the
holy
trinity
is
very
god
not
made
not
created
not
begotten
but
proceeding
from
both
the
father
and
the
son
by
a
certain
mean
unknown
unto
men
and
unspeakable
and
that
it
is
his
property
to
mollify
and
soften
the
hardness
of
man
heart
when
he
is
once
received
thereinto
either
by
the
wholesome
preaching
of
the
gospel
or
by
any
other
way
that
he
doth
give
men
light
and
guide
them
unto
the
knowledge
of
god
to
all
way
of
truth
to
newness
of
the
whole
life
and
to
everlasting
hope
of
salvation
we
believe
that
there
is
one
church
of
god
and
that
the
same
is
not
shut
up
as
in
times
past
among
the
jews
into
some
one
corner
or
kingdom
but
that
it
is
catholic
and
universal
and
dispersed
throughout
the
whole
world
so
that
there
is
now
no
nation
which
may
truly
complain
that
they
be
shut
forth
and
may
not
be
one
of
the
church
and
people
of
god
and
that
this
church
is
the
kingdom
the
body
and
the
spouse
of
christ
and
that
christ
alone
is
the
prince
of
this
kingdom
that
christ
alone
is
the
head
of
this
body
and
that
christ
alone
is
the
bridegroom
of
this
spouse
furthermore
we
believe
that
there
be
divers
degrees
of
ministers
in
the
church
whereof
some
be
deacons
some
priests
some
bishops
to
whom
is
committed
the
office
to
instruct
the
people
and
the
whole
charge
and
setting
forth
of
religion
yet
notwithstanding
we
say
that
there
neither
is
nor
can
be
any
one
man
which
may
have
the
whole
superiority
in
this
universal
state
for
that
christ
is
ever
present
to
assist
his
church
and
needeth
not
any
man
to
supply
his
room
as
his
only
heir
to
all
his
substance
and
that
there
can
be
no
one
mortal
creature
which
is
able
to
comprehend
or
conceive
in
his
mind
the
universal
church
that
is
to
wit
all
the
parts
of
the
world
much
less
able
rightly
and
duly
to
put
them
in
order
and
to
govern
them
rightly
and
duly
for
all
the
apostles
as
cyprian
saith
were
of
like
power
among
themselves
and
the
rest
were
the
same
that
peter
was
and
that
it
said
indifferently
to
them
all
feed
ye
indifferently
to
them
all
go
into
the
whole
world
indifferently
to
them
all
teach
ye
the
gospel
and
as
hierom
saith
all
bishops
wheresoever
they
be
be
they
at
rome
be
they
at
eugubium
be
they
at
constantinople
be
they
at
rhegium
be
all
of
like
and
of
like
priesthood
and
as
cyprian
saith
there
is
but
one
bishopric
and
a
piece
thereof
is
perfectly
and
wholly
holden
of
every
particular
bishop
and
according
to
the
judgment
of
the
nicene
council
we
say
that
the
bishop
of
rome
hath
no
more
jurisdiction
over
the
church
of
god
than
the
rest
of
the
patriarchs
either
of
alexandria
or
of
antiochia
have
and
as
for
the
bishop
of
rome
who
now
calleth
all
matters
before
himself
alone
except
he
do
his
duty
as
he
ought
to
do
except
he
minister
the
sacraments
except
he
instruct
the
people
except
he
warn
them
and
teach
them
we
say
that
he
ought
not
of
right
once
to
be
called
a
bishop
or
so
much
as
an
elder
for
a
bishop
as
saith
augustine
is
a
name
of
labour
and
not
of
honour
because
he
will
have
that
man
understand
himself
to
be
no
bishop
which
will
seek
to
have
eminence
and
not
to
profit
others
and
that
neither
the
pope
nor
any
other
worldly
creature
can
no
more
be
head
of
the
whole
church
or
a
bishop
over
all
than
he
can
be
the
bridegroom
the
light
the
salvation
and
life
of
the
church
for
the
privileges
and
names
belong
only
to
christ
and
be
properly
and
only
fit
for
him
alone
and
that
no
bishop
of
rome
did
ever
suffer
himself
to
be
called
by
such
a
proud
name
before
phocas
the
emperor
time
who
as
we
know
by
killing
his
own
sovereign
maurice
the
emperor
did
by
a
traitorous
villainy
aspire
to
the
empire
about
the
six
hundredth
and
thirteenth
year
after
christ
was
born
also
the
council
of
carthage
did
circumspectly
provide
that
no
bishop
should
be
called
the
highest
bishop
or
chief
priest
and
therefore
sithence
the
bishop
of
rome
will
nowadays
so
be
called
and
challengeth
unto
himself
an
authority
that
is
none
of
his
besides
that
he
doth
plainly
contrary
to
the
ancient
councils
and
contrary
to
the
old
fathers
we
believe
that
he
doth
give
unto
himself
as
it
is
written
by
his
own
companion
gregory
a
presumptuous
a
profane
a
sacrilegious
and
an
antichristian
name
that
he
is
also
the
king
of
pride
that
he
is
lucifer
which
preferreth
himself
before
his
brethren
that
he
hath
forsaken
the
faith
and
is
the
forerunner
of
antichrist
further
we
say
that
the
minister
ought
lawfully
duly
and
orderly
to
be
preferred
to
that
office
of
the
church
of
god
and
that
no
man
hath
power
to
wrest
himself
into
the
holy
ministry
at
his
own
pleasure
and
list
wherefore
these
persons
do
us
the
greater
wrong
which
have
nothing
so
common
in
their
mouths
as
that
we
do
nothing
orderly
and
comely
but
all
things
troublesomely
and
without
order
and
that
we
allow
every
man
to
be
a
priest
to
be
a
teacher
and
to
be
an
interpreter
of
the
scriptures
moreover
we
say
that
christ
hath
given
to
his
ministers
power
to
bind
to
loose
to
open
to
shut
and
that
the
office
of
loosing
consisteth
in
this
point
that
the
minister
should
either
offer
by
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
the
merits
of
christ
and
full
pardon
to
such
as
have
lowly
and
contrite
hearts
and
do
unfeignedly
repent
themselves
pronouncing
unto
the
same
a
sure
and
undoubted
forgiveness
of
their
sins
and
hope
of
everlasting
salvation
or
else
that
the
same
minister
when
any
have
offended
their
brothers
minds
with
a
great
offence
with
a
notable
and
open
fault
whereby
they
have
as
it
were
banished
and
made
themselves
strangers
from
the
common
fellowship
and
from
the
body
of
christ
then
after
perfect
amendment
of
such
persons
doth
reconcile
them
and
bring
them
home
again
and
restore
them
to
the
company
and
unity
of
the
faithful
we
say
also
that
the
minister
doth
execute
the
authority
of
binding
and
shutting
as
often
as
he
shutteth
up
the
gate
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
against
the
unbelieving
and
stubborn
persons
denouncing
unto
them
god
vengeance
and
everlasting
punishment
or
else
when
he
doth
quite
shut
them
out
from
the
bosom
of
the
church
by
open
excommunication
out
of
doubt
what
sentence
soever
the
minister
of
god
shall
give
in
this
sort
god
himself
doth
so
well
allow
of
it
that
whatsoever
here
in
earth
by
their
means
is
loosed
and
bound
god
himself
will
loose
and
bind
and
confirm
the
same
in
heaven
and
touching
the
keys
wherewith
they
may
either
shut
or
open
the
kingdom
of
heaven
we
with
chrysostom
say
they
be
the
knowledge
of
the
scriptures
with
tertullian
we
say
they
be
the
interpretation
of
the
law
and
with
eusebius
we
call
them
the
word
of
god
moreover
that
christ
disciples
did
receive
this
authority
not
that
they
should
hear
the
private
confessions
of
the
people
and
listen
to
their
whisperings
as
the
common
do
everywhere
nowadays
and
do
it
so
as
though
in
that
one
point
lay
all
the
virtue
and
use
of
the
keys
but
to
the
end
they
should
go
they
should
teach
they
should
publish
abroad
the
gospel
and
be
unto
the
believing
a
sweet
savour
of
life
unto
life
and
unto
the
unbelieving
and
unfaithful
a
savour
of
death
unto
death
and
that
the
minds
of
godly
persons
being
brought
low
by
the
remorse
of
their
former
life
and
errors
after
they
once
began
to
look
up
unto
the
light
of
the
gospel
and
believe
in
christ
might
be
opened
with
the
word
of
god
even
as
a
door
is
opened
with
a
key
contrariwise
that
the
wicked
and
wilful
folk
and
such
as
would
not
believe
nor
return
into
the
right
way
should
be
left
still
as
fast
locked
and
shut
up
and
as
paul
saith
wax
worse
and
worse
this
take
we
to
be
the
meaning
of
the
keys
and
that
after
this
sort
men
consciences
either
be
opened
or
shut
we
say
that
the
priest
indeed
is
a
judge
in
this
case
but
yet
hath
no
manner
of
right
to
challenge
an
authority
or
power
as
saith
ambrose
and
therefore
our
saviour
jesu
christ
to
reprove
the
negligence
of
the
scribes
and
pharisees
in
teaching
did
with
these
words
rebuke
them
saying
woe
be
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
which
have
taken
away
the
keys
of
knowledge
and
have
shut
up
the
kingdom
of
heaven
before
men
seeing
then
the
key
whereby
the
way
and
entry
to
the
kingdom
of
god
is
opened
unto
us
is
the
word
of
the
gospel
and
the
expounding
of
the
law
and
scriptures
we
say
plainly
where
the
same
word
is
not
there
is
not
the
key
and
seeing
one
manner
of
word
is
given
to
all
and
one
only
key
belongeth
to
all
we
say
that
there
is
but
one
only
power
of
all
ministers
as
concerning
opening
and
shutting
and
as
touching
the
bishop
of
rome
for
all
his
parasites
flatteringly
sing
these
words
in
his
ears
to
thee
will
i
give
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
as
though
those
keys
were
fit
for
him
alone
and
for
nobody
else
except
he
go
so
to
work
as
men
consciences
may
be
made
pliant
and
be
subdued
to
the
word
of
god
we
deny
that
he
doth
either
open
or
shut
or
hath
the
keys
at
all
and
although
he
taught
and
instructed
the
people
as
would
god
he
might
once
truly
do
and
persuade
himself
it
were
at
the
least
some
piece
of
his
duty
yet
we
think
his
key
to
be
never
a
whit
better
or
of
greater
force
than
other
men
for
who
hath
severed
him
from
the
rest
who
hath
taught
him
more
cunningly
to
open
or
better
to
absolve
than
his
brethren
we
say
that
matrimony
is
holy
and
honourable
in
all
sorts
and
states
of
persons
in
the
patriarchs
in
the
prophets
in
the
apostles
in
holy
martyrs
in
the
ministers
of
the
church
and
in
bishops
and
that
it
is
an
honest
and
lawful
thing
as
chrysostom
saith
for
a
man
living
in
matrimony
to
take
upon
him
therewith
the
dignity
of
a
bishop
and
as
sozomenus
saith
of
spiridion
and
as
nazianzen
saith
of
his
own
father
that
a
good
and
diligent
bishop
doth
serve
in
the
ministry
never
the
worse
for
that
he
is
married
but
rather
the
better
and
with
more
ableness
to
do
good
further
we
say
that
the
same
law
which
by
constraint
taketh
away
this
liberty
from
men
and
compelleth
them
against
their
wills
to
live
single
is
the
doctrine
of
devils
as
paul
saith
and
that
ever
sithence
the
time
of
this
law
a
wonderful
uncleanness
of
life
and
manners
in
god
ministers
and
sundry
horrible
enormities
have
followed
as
the
bishop
of
augusta
as
faber
as
abbas
panormitanus
as
latomus
as
the
tripartite
work
which
is
annexed
to
the
second
tome
of
the
councils
and
other
champions
of
the
pope
band
yea
and
as
the
matter
itself
and
all
histories
do
confess
for
it
was
rightly
said
by
pius
the
second
bishop
of
rome
that
he
saw
many
causes
why
wives
should
be
taken
away
from
priests
but
that
he
saw
many
more
and
more
weighty
causes
why
they
ought
to
be
restored
them
again
we
receive
and
embrace
all
the
canonical
scriptures
both
of
the
old
and
new
testament
giving
thanks
to
our
god
who
hath
raised
up
unto
us
that
light
which
we
might
ever
have
before
our
eyes
lest
either
by
the
subtlety
of
man
or
by
the
snares
of
the
devil
we
should
be
carried
away
to
errors
and
lies
also
that
these
be
the
heavenly
voices
whereby
god
hath
opened
unto
us
his
will
and
that
only
in
them
man
heart
can
have
settled
rest
that
in
them
be
abundantly
and
fully
comprehended
all
things
whatsoever
be
needful
for
our
salvation
as
origen
augustine
chrysostom
and
cyrillus
have
taught
that
they
be
the
very
might
and
strength
of
god
to
attain
to
salvation
that
they
be
the
foundations
of
the
prophets
and
apostles
whereupon
is
built
the
church
of
god
that
they
be
the
very
sure
and
infallible
rule
whereby
may
be
tried
whether
the
church
do
stagger
or
err
and
whereunto
all
ecclesiastical
doctrine
ought
to
be
called
to
account
and
that
against
these
scriptures
neither
law
nor
ordinance
nor
any
custom
ought
to
be
heard
no
though
paul
his
own
self
or
an
angel
from
heaven
should
come
and
teach
the
contrary
moreover
we
allow
the
sacraments
of
the
church
that
is
to
say
certain
holy
signs
and
ceremonies
which
christ
would
we
should
use
that
by
them
he
might
set
before
our
eyes
the
mysteries
of
our
salvation
and
might
more
strongly
confirm
our
faith
which
we
have
in
his
blood
and
might
seal
his
grace
in
our
hearts
and
these
sacraments
together
with
tertullian
origen
ambrose
hierom
chrysostom
basil
dionysius
and
other
catholic
fathers
do
we
call
figures
signs
marks
or
badges
prints
copies
forms
seals
signets
similitudes
patterns
representations
remembrances
and
memories
and
we
make
no
doubt
together
with
the
same
doctors
to
say
that
these
be
certain
visible
words
seals
of
righteousness
tokens
of
grace
and
do
expressly
pronounce
that
in
the
lord
supper
there
is
truly
given
unto
the
believing
the
body
and
blood
of
the
lord
the
flesh
of
the
son
of
god
which
quickeneth
our
souls
the
meat
that
cometh
from
above
the
food
of
immortality
grace
truth
and
life
and
the
supper
to
be
the
communion
of
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
by
the
partaking
whereof
we
be
revived
we
be
strengthened
and
be
fed
unto
immortality
and
whereby
we
are
joined
united
and
incorporate
unto
christ
that
we
may
abide
in
him
and
he
in
us
besides
we
acknowledge
there
be
two
sacraments
which
we
judge
properly
ought
to
be
called
by
this
name
that
is
to
say
baptism
and
the
sacrament
of
thanksgiving
for
thus
many
we
say
were
delivered
and
sanctified
by
christ
and
well
allowed
of
the
old
fathers
ambrose
and
augustine
we
say
that
baptism
is
a
sacrament
of
the
remission
of
sins
and
of
that
washing
which
we
have
in
the
blood
of
christ
and
that
no
person
which
will
profess
christ
name
ought
to
be
restrained
or
kept
back
therefrom
no
not
the
very
babes
of
christians
forsomuch
as
they
be
born
in
sin
and
do
pertain
unto
the
people
of
god
we
say
that
eucharistia
that
is
to
say
the
supper
of
the
lord
is
a
sacrament
that
is
to
wit
an
evident
token
of
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
wherein
is
set
as
it
were
before
our
eyes
the
death
of
christ
and
his
resurrection
and
what
act
soever
he
did
whilst
he
was
in
his
mortal
body
to
the
end
we
may
give
him
thanks
for
his
death
and
for
our
deliverance
and
that
by
the
often
receiving
of
this
sacrament
we
may
daily
renew
the
remembrance
of
that
matter
to
the
intent
we
being
fed
with
the
true
body
and
blood
of
christ
may
be
brought
into
the
hope
of
the
resurrection
and
of
everlasting
life
and
may
most
assuredly
believe
that
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
doth
in
like
manner
feed
our
souls
as
bread
and
wine
doth
feed
our
bodies
to
this
banquet
we
think
the
people
of
god
ought
to
be
earnestly
bidden
that
they
may
all
communicate
among
themselves
and
openly
declare
and
testify
both
the
godly
society
which
is
among
them
and
also
the
hope
which
they
have
in
christ
jesu
for
this
cause
if
there
had
been
any
which
would
be
but
a
and
abstain
from
the
holy
communion
him
did
the
old
fathers
and
bishops
of
rome
in
the
primitive
church
before
private
mass
came
up
excommunicate
as
a
wicked
person
and
as
a
pagan
neither
was
there
any
christian
at
that
time
which
did
communicate
alone
whiles
other
looked
on
for
so
did
calixtus
in
times
past
decree
that
after
the
consecration
was
finished
all
should
communicate
except
they
had
rather
stand
without
the
because
thus
saith
he
did
the
apostles
appoint
and
the
same
the
holy
church
of
rome
keepeth
still
moreover
when
the
people
cometh
to
the
holy
communion
the
sacrament
ought
to
be
given
them
in
both
kinds
for
so
both
christ
hath
commanded
and
the
apostles
in
every
place
have
ordained
and
all
the
ancient
fathers
and
catholic
bishops
have
followed
the
same
and
whoso
doth
contrary
to
this
he
as
gelasius
saith
committeth
sacrilege
and
therefore
we
say
that
our
adversaries
at
this
day
who
having
violently
thrust
out
and
quite
forbidden
the
holy
communion
do
without
the
word
of
god
without
the
authority
of
any
ancient
council
without
any
catholic
father
without
any
example
of
the
primitive
church
yea
and
without
reason
also
defend
and
maintain
their
private
masses
and
the
mangling
of
the
sacraments
and
do
this
not
only
against
the
plain
express
commandment
and
bidding
of
christ
but
also
against
all
antiquity
do
wickedly
therein
and
are
very
church
robbers
we
affirm
that
bread
and
wine
are
holy
and
heavenly
mysteries
of
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
and
that
by
them
christ
himself
being
the
true
bread
of
eternal
life
is
so
presently
given
unto
us
as
that
by
faith
we
verily
receive
his
body
and
his
blood
yet
say
we
not
this
so
as
though
we
thought
that
the
nature
and
substance
of
the
bread
and
wine
is
clearly
changed
and
goeth
to
nothing
as
many
have
dreamed
in
these
later
times
which
yet
could
never
agree
among
themselves
of
this
their
dream
for
that
was
not
christ
meaning
that
the
wheaten
bread
should
lay
apart
his
own
nature
and
receive
a
certain
new
divinity
but
that
he
might
rather
change
us
and
to
use
theophylact
words
might
transform
us
into
his
body
for
what
can
be
said
more
plainly
than
that
which
ambrose
saith
bread
and
wine
remain
still
the
same
they
were
before
and
yet
are
changed
into
another
thing
or
that
which
gelasius
saith
the
substance
of
the
bread
or
the
nature
of
the
wine
ceaseth
not
so
to
be
or
that
which
theodoret
saith
after
the
consecration
the
mystical
signs
do
not
cast
off
their
own
proper
nature
for
they
remain
still
on
their
former
substance
form
and
kind
or
that
which
augustine
saith
that
which
ye
see
is
the
bread
and
cup
for
so
our
eyes
tell
us
but
that
which
your
faith
requireth
to
be
taught
is
this
the
bread
is
the
body
of
christ
and
the
cup
is
his
blood
or
that
which
origen
saith
the
bread
which
is
sanctified
by
the
word
of
god
as
touching
the
material
substance
thereof
goeth
into
the
belly
and
is
cast
out
into
the
privy
or
that
which
christ
himself
said
not
only
after
the
blessing
of
the
cup
but
after
he
had
ministered
the
communion
i
will
drink
no
more
of
this
fruit
of
the
vine
it
is
well
known
that
the
fruit
of
the
vine
is
wine
and
not
blood
and
in
speaking
thus
we
mean
not
to
abase
the
lord
supper
that
it
is
but
a
cold
ceremony
only
and
nothing
to
be
wrought
therein
as
many
falsely
slander
us
we
teach
for
we
affirm
that
christ
doth
truly
and
presently
give
his
own
self
in
his
sacraments
in
baptism
that
we
may
put
him
on
and
in
his
supper
that
we
may
eat
him
by
faith
and
spirit
and
may
have
everlasting
life
by
his
cross
and
blood
and
we
say
not
this
is
done
slightly
and
coldly
but
effectually
and
truly
for
although
we
do
not
touch
the
body
of
christ
with
teeth
and
mouth
yet
we
hold
him
fast
and
eat
him
by
faith
by
understanding
and
by
the
spirit
and
it
is
no
vain
faith
which
doth
comprehend
christ
and
that
is
not
received
with
cold
devotion
that
is
received
with
understanding
with
faith
and
with
spirit
for
christ
himself
altogether
is
so
offered
and
given
us
in
these
mysteries
that
we
may
certainly
know
we
be
flesh
of
his
flesh
and
bone
of
his
bones
and
that
christ
continueth
in
us
and
we
in
him
and
therefore
in
celebrating
these
mysteries
the
people
are
to
good
purpose
exhorted
before
they
come
to
receive
the
holy
communion
to
lift
up
their
hearts
and
to
direct
their
minds
to
heavenward
because
he
is
there
by
whom
we
must
be
full
fed
and
live
cyril
saith
when
we
come
to
receive
these
mysteries
all
gross
imaginations
must
quite
be
banished
the
council
of
nice
as
is
alleged
by
some
in
greek
plainly
forbiddeth
us
to
be
basely
affectioned
or
bent
toward
the
bread
and
wine
which
are
set
before
us
and
as
chrysostom
very
aptly
writeth
we
say
that
the
body
of
christ
is
the
dead
carcase
and
we
ourselves
must
be
the
eagles
meaning
thereby
that
we
must
fly
high
if
we
will
come
unto
the
body
of
christ
for
this
table
as
chrysostom
saith
is
a
table
of
eagles
and
not
of
jays
cyprian
also
this
bread
saith
he
is
the
food
of
the
soul
and
not
the
meat
of
the
belly
and
augustine
how
shall
i
hold
him
saith
he
which
is
absent
how
shall
i
reach
my
hand
up
to
heaven
to
lay
hold
upon
him
that
sitteth
there
he
answereth
reach
hither
thy
faith
and
then
thou
hast
laid
hold
on
him
we
can
not
also
away
in
our
churches
with
the
shows
and
sales
and
buying
and
selling
of
masses
nor
the
carrying
about
and
worshipping
of
bread
nor
such
other
idolatrous
and
blasphemous
fondness
which
none
of
them
can
prove
that
christ
or
his
apostles
did
ever
ordain
or
left
unto
us
and
we
justly
blame
the
bishops
of
rome
who
without
the
word
of
god
without
the
authority
of
the
holy
fathers
without
any
example
of
antiquity
after
a
new
guise
do
not
only
set
before
the
people
the
sacramental
bread
to
be
worshipped
as
god
but
do
also
carry
about
the
same
upon
an
ambling
horse
whithersoever
themselves
journey
as
in
old
times
the
persians
fire
and
the
relics
of
the
goddess
isis
were
solemnly
carried
about
in
procession
and
have
brought
the
sacraments
of
christ
to
be
used
now
as
a
stage
play
and
a
solemn
sight
to
the
end
that
men
eyes
should
be
fed
with
nothing
else
but
with
mad
gazings
and
foolish
gauds
in
the
matter
wherein
the
death
of
christ
ought
diligently
to
be
beaten
into
our
hearts
and
wherein
also
the
mysteries
of
our
redemption
ought
with
all
holiness
and
reverence
to
be
executed
besides
where
they
say
and
sometimes
do
persuade
fools
that
they
are
able
by
their
masses
to
distribute
and
apply
unto
men
commodity
all
the
merits
of
christ
death
yea
although
many
times
the
parties
think
nothing
of
the
matter
and
understand
full
little
what
is
done
this
is
a
mockery
an
heathenish
fancy
and
a
very
toy
for
it
is
our
faith
that
applieth
the
death
and
cross
of
christ
to
our
benefit
and
not
the
act
of
the
massing
priest
faith
had
in
the
sacraments
saith
augustine
doth
justify
and
not
the
sacraments
and
origen
saith
christ
is
the
priest
the
propitiation
and
sacrifice
which
propitiation
cometh
to
every
one
by
means
of
faith
so
that
by
this
reckoning
we
say
that
the
sacraments
of
christ
without
faith
do
not
once
profit
these
that
be
alive
a
great
deal
less
do
they
profit
those
that
be
dead
and
as
for
their
brags
they
are
wont
to
make
of
their
purgatory
though
we
know
it
is
not
a
thing
so
very
late
risen
amongst
them
yet
is
it
no
better
than
a
blockish
and
an
old
wives
device
augustine
indeed
sometime
saith
there
is
such
a
certain
place
sometime
he
denieth
not
but
there
may
be
such
a
one
sometime
he
doubteth
sometime
again
he
utterly
denieth
it
to
be
and
thinketh
that
men
are
therein
deceived
by
a
certain
natural
good
will
they
bear
their
friends
departed
but
yet
of
this
one
error
hath
there
grown
up
such
a
harvest
of
these
the
masses
being
sold
abroad
commonly
in
every
corner
the
temples
of
god
became
shops
to
get
money
and
silly
souls
were
persuaded
that
nothing
was
more
necessary
to
be
bought
indeed
there
was
nothing
more
gainful
for
these
men
to
sell
as
touching
the
multitude
of
vain
and
superfluous
ceremonies
we
know
that
augustine
did
grievously
complain
of
them
in
his
own
time
and
therefore
have
we
cut
off
a
great
number
of
them
because
we
know
that
men
consciences
were
cumbered
about
them
and
the
churches
of
god
overladen
with
them
nevertheless
we
keep
still
and
esteem
not
only
those
ceremonies
which
we
are
sure
were
delivered
us
from
the
apostles
but
some
others
too
besides
which
we
thought
might
be
suffered
without
hurt
to
the
church
of
god
because
that
we
had
a
desire
that
all
things
in
the
holy
congregation
might
as
paul
commandeth
be
done
with
comeliness
and
in
good
order
but
as
for
all
those
things
which
we
saw
were
either
very
superstitious
or
wholly
unprofitable
or
noisome
or
mockeries
or
contrary
to
the
holy
scriptures
or
else
unseemly
for
honest
or
discreet
folks
as
there
be
an
infinite
number
nowadays
where
papistry
is
used
these
i
say
we
have
utterly
refused
without
all
manner
exception
because
we
would
not
have
the
right
worshipping
of
god
any
longer
denied
with
such
follies
we
make
our
prayers
in
that
tongue
which
all
our
people
as
meet
is
may
understand
to
the
end
they
may
as
paul
counselleth
us
take
common
commodity
by
common
prayer
even
as
all
the
holy
fathers
and
catholic
bishops
both
in
the
old
and
new
testament
did
used
to
pray
themselves
and
taught
the
people
to
pray
too
lest
as
augustine
saith
like
parrots
and
ousels
we
should
seem
to
speak
that
we
understand
not
neither
have
we
any
other
mediator
and
intercessor
by
whom
we
may
have
access
to
god
the
father
than
jesus
christ
in
whose
only
name
all
things
are
obtained
at
his
father
hand
but
it
is
a
shameful
part
and
full
of
infidelity
that
we
see
every
whore
used
in
the
churches
of
our
adversaries
not
only
in
that
they
will
have
innumerable
sorts
of
mediators
and
that
utterly
without
the
authority
of
god
word
so
that
as
jeremy
saith
the
saints
be
now
as
many
in
number
or
rather
above
the
number
of
the
cities
and
poor
men
can
not
tell
to
which
saint
it
were
best
to
turn
them
first
and
though
there
be
so
many
as
they
can
not
be
told
yet
every
one
of
them
hath
his
peculiar
duty
and
office
assigned
unto
him
of
these
folks
what
thing
they
ought
to
ask
what
to
give
and
what
to
bring
to
pass
but
besides
this
also
in
that
they
do
not
only
wickedly
but
also
shamefully
call
upon
the
blessed
virgin
mother
to
have
her
remember
that
she
is
the
mother
and
to
command
her
son
and
to
use
a
mother
authority
over
him
we
say
also
that
every
person
is
born
in
sin
and
leadeth
his
life
in
sin
that
nobody
is
able
truly
to
say
his
heart
is
clean
that
the
most
righteous
person
is
but
an
unprofitable
servant
that
the
law
of
god
is
perfect
and
requireth
of
us
perfect
and
full
obedience
that
we
are
able
by
no
means
to
fulfil
that
law
in
this
worldly
life
that
there
is
no
one
mortal
creature
which
can
be
justified
by
his
own
deserts
in
god
sight
and
therefore
that
our
only
succour
and
refuge
is
to
fly
to
the
mercy
of
our
father
by
jesu
christ
and
assuredly
to
persuade
our
minds
that
he
is
the
obtainer
of
forgiveness
for
our
sins
and
that
by
his
blood
all
our
spots
of
sin
be
washed
clean
that
he
hath
pacified
and
set
at
one
all
things
by
the
blood
of
his
cross
that
he
by
the
same
one
only
sacrifice
which
he
once
offered
upon
the
cross
hath
brought
to
effect
and
fulfilled
all
things
and
that
for
that
cause
he
said
when
he
gave
up
the
ghost
it
is
finished
as
though
he
would
signify
that
the
price
and
ransom
was
now
full
paid
for
the
sin
of
all
mankind
if
there
be
any
then
that
think
this
sacrifice
not
sufficient
let
them
go
in
god
name
and
seek
another
that
is
better
we
verily
because
we
know
this
to
be
the
only
sacrifice
are
well
content
with
it
alone
and
look
for
none
other
and
forasmuch
as
it
was
to
be
offered
but
once
we
command
it
not
to
be
renewed
again
and
because
it
was
full
and
perfect
in
all
points
and
parts
we
do
not
ordain
in
place
thereof
any
continual
succession
of
offerings
besides
though
we
say
we
have
no
meed
at
all
by
our
own
works
and
deeds
but
appoint
all
the
means
of
our
salvation
to
be
in
christ
alone
yet
say
we
not
that
for
this
cause
men
ought
to
live
loosely
and
dissolutely
nor
that
it
is
enough
for
a
christian
to
be
baptised
only
and
to
believe
as
though
there
were
nothing
else
required
at
his
hand
for
true
faith
is
lively
and
can
in
no
wise
be
idle
thus
therefore
teach
we
the
people
that
god
hath
called
us
not
to
follow
riot
and
wantonness
but
as
paul
saith
unto
good
works
to
walk
in
them
that
god
hath
plucked
us
out
from
the
power
of
darkness
to
the
end
that
we
should
serve
the
living
god
to
cut
away
all
the
remnants
of
sin
and
to
work
our
salvation
in
fear
and
trembling
that
it
may
appear
how
that
the
spirit
of
sanctification
is
in
our
bodies
and
that
christ
himself
doth
dwell
in
our
hearts
to
conclude
we
believe
that
this
our
flesh
wherein
we
live
although
it
die
and
come
to
dust
yet
at
the
last
day
it
shall
return
again
to
life
by
the
means
of
christ
spirit
which
dwelleth
in
us
and
that
then
verily
whatsoever
we
suffer
here
in
the
meanwhile
for
his
sake
christ
will
wipe
away
all
tears
and
lamentation
from
our
eyes
and
that
we
through
him
shall
enjoy
everlasting
life
and
shall
for
ever
be
with
him
in
glory
so
be
it
part
iii
behold
these
are
the
horrible
heresies
for
the
which
a
good
part
of
the
world
is
at
this
day
condemned
by
the
bishop
of
rome
and
yet
were
never
heard
to
plead
their
cause
he
should
have
commenced
his
suit
rather
against
christ
against
the
apostles
and
against
the
holy
fathers
for
these
things
did
not
only
proceed
from
them
but
were
also
appointed
by
them
except
perhaps
these
men
will
say
as
i
think
they
will
indeed
that
christ
never
instituted
the
holy
communion
to
be
divided
amongst
the
faithful
or
that
christ
apostles
and
the
ancient
fathers
said
private
masses
in
every
corner
of
the
temples
now
ten
now
twenty
together
in
one
day
or
that
christ
and
his
apostles
banished
all
the
common
people
from
the
sacrament
of
his
blood
or
that
the
thing
which
they
themselves
do
at
this
day
everywhere
and
do
it
so
as
they
condemn
him
for
a
heretic
which
doth
otherwise
is
not
called
of
gelasius
their
own
doctor
plain
sacrilege
or
that
these
be
not
the
very
words
of
ambrose
augustine
gelasius
theodoret
chrysostom
and
origen
the
bread
and
wine
in
the
sacraments
remain
still
the
same
they
were
before
the
thing
which
is
seen
upon
the
holy
table
is
bread
there
ceaseth
not
to
be
still
the
substance
of
bread
and
nature
of
wine
the
substance
and
nature
of
bread
are
not
changed
the
bread
as
touching
the
material
substance
goeth
into
the
belly
and
is
cast
out
into
the
privy
or
that
christ
the
apostles
and
holy
fathers
prayed
not
in
that
tongue
which
the
people
might
understand
or
that
christ
hath
not
performed
all
things
by
that
one
offering
which
he
once
offered
or
that
the
same
sacrifice
was
unperfect
and
so
now
we
have
need
of
another
all
these
things
must
they
of
necessity
say
unless
perchance
they
had
rather
say
thus
that
all
law
and
right
is
locked
up
in
the
treasury
of
the
pope
breast
and
that
as
once
one
of
his
soothing
pages
and
did
not
stick
to
say
the
pope
is
able
to
dispense
against
the
apostles
against
a
council
and
against
the
canons
and
rules
of
the
apostles
and
that
he
is
not
bound
to
stand
neither
to
the
examples
nor
to
the
ordinances
nor
to
the
laws
of
christ
we
for
our
part
have
learned
these
things
of
christ
of
the
apostles
of
the
devout
fathers
and
do
sincerely
with
good
faith
teach
the
people
of
god
the
same
which
thing
is
the
only
cause
why
we
at
this
day
are
called
heretics
of
the
chief
prelates
no
doubt
of
religion
o
immortal
god
hath
christ
himself
then
the
apostles
and
so
many
fathers
all
at
once
gone
astray
were
then
origen
ambrose
augustine
chrysostom
gelasius
theodoret
forsakers
of
the
catholic
faith
was
so
notable
a
consent
of
so
many
ancient
bishops
and
learned
men
nothing
else
but
a
conspiracy
of
heretics
or
is
that
now
condemned
in
us
which
was
then
commended
in
them
or
is
the
thing
now
by
alteration
only
of
affections
suddenly
become
schismatic
which
in
them
was
counted
catholic
or
shall
that
which
in
times
past
was
true
now
because
it
liketh
not
these
men
be
judged
false
let
them
then
bring
forth
another
gospel
and
let
them
show
the
causes
why
these
things
which
so
long
have
openly
been
observed
and
in
the
church
of
god
ought
now
in
the
end
to
be
called
in
again
we
know
well
enough
that
the
same
word
which
was
opened
by
christ
and
spread
abroad
by
the
apostles
is
sufficient
both
our
salvation
and
all
truth
to
uphold
and
maintain
and
also
to
confound
all
manner
of
heresy
by
that
word
only
do
we
condemn
all
sorts
of
the
old
heretics
whom
these
men
say
we
have
called
out
of
hell
again
as
for
the
arians
the
eutychians
the
marcionites
the
ebionites
the
valentinians
the
carpocratians
the
tatians
the
novatians
and
shortly
all
them
which
have
a
wicked
opinion
either
of
god
the
father
or
of
christ
or
of
the
holy
ghost
or
of
any
other
point
of
christian
religion
forsomuch
as
they
be
confuted
by
the
gospel
of
christ
we
plainly
pronounce
them
for
detestable
and
castaway
persons
and
defy
them
even
unto
the
devil
neither
do
we
leave
them
so
but
we
also
severely
and
straitly
hold
them
in
by
lawful
and
politic
punishments
if
they
fortune
to
break
out
anywhere
and
bewray
themselves
indeed
we
grant
that
certain
new
and
very
strange
sects
as
the
anabaptists
libertines
menonians
and
zuenckfeldians
have
been
stirring
in
the
world
ever
since
the
gospel
did
first
spring
but
the
world
seeth
now
right
well
thanks
be
given
to
our
god
that
we
neither
have
bred
nor
taught
nor
kept
up
these
monsters
in
good
fellowship
i
pray
thee
whosoever
thou
be
read
our
books
they
are
to
be
sold
in
every
place
what
hath
there
ever
been
written
by
any
of
our
company
which
might
plainly
bear
with
the
madness
of
any
of
those
heretics
nay
i
say
unto
you
there
is
no
country
this
day
so
free
from
their
pestilent
infections
as
they
be
wherein
the
gospel
is
freely
and
commonly
taught
so
that
if
they
weigh
the
very
matter
with
earnest
and
upright
advisement
this
thing
is
a
great
argument
that
this
same
is
the
very
truth
of
the
gospel
of
christ
which
we
do
teach
for
lightly
neither
is
cockle
wont
to
grow
without
the
wheat
nor
yet
the
chaff
without
the
corn
for
from
the
very
apostles
times
who
knoweth
not
how
many
heresies
did
rise
up
even
together
so
soon
as
the
gospel
was
first
spread
abroad
who
ever
had
heard
tell
of
simon
menander
saturninus
basilides
carpocrates
cerinthus
ebion
valentinus
secundus
marcosius
colorbasius
heracleo
lucianus
and
severus
before
the
apostles
were
sent
abroad
but
why
stand
we
reckoning
up
these
epiphanius
rehearseth
up
fourscore
sundry
heresies
and
augustine
many
more
which
sprang
up
even
together
with
the
gospel
what
then
was
the
gospel
therefore
not
the
gospel
because
heresies
sprang
up
withal
or
was
christ
therefore
not
christ
and
yet
as
we
said
doth
not
this
great
crop
and
heap
of
heresies
grow
up
amongst
us
which
do
openly
abroad
and
frankly
teach
the
gospel
these
poisons
take
their
beginnings
their
increasings
and
strength
amongst
our
adversaries
in
blindness
and
in
darkness
amongst
whom
truth
is
with
cruelty
and
tyranny
kept
under
and
can
not
be
heard
but
in
corners
and
secret
meetings
but
let
them
make
a
proof
let
them
give
the
gospel
free
passage
let
the
truth
of
jesu
christ
give
his
clear
light
and
stretch
forth
his
bright
beams
into
all
parts
and
then
shall
they
forthwith
see
how
all
these
shadows
straight
will
vanish
and
pass
away
at
the
light
of
the
gospel
even
as
the
thick
mist
of
the
night
consumeth
at
the
sight
of
the
sun
for
whilst
these
men
sit
still
and
make
merry
and
do
nothing
we
continually
repress
and
put
back
all
those
heresies
which
they
falsely
charge
us
to
nourish
and
maintain
where
they
say
that
we
have
fallen
into
sundry
sects
and
would
be
called
some
of
us
lutherians
and
some
of
us
zuinglians
and
can
not
yet
well
agree
among
ourselves
touching
the
whole
substance
of
doctrine
what
would
these
men
have
said
if
they
had
been
in
the
first
times
of
the
apostles
and
holy
fathers
when
one
said
i
hold
of
paul
another
i
hold
of
cephas
another
i
hold
of
apollo
when
paul
did
so
sharply
rebuke
peter
when
upon
a
falling
out
barnabas
departed
from
paul
when
as
origen
mentioneth
the
christians
were
divided
into
so
many
factions
as
that
they
kept
no
more
but
the
name
of
christians
in
common
among
them
being
in
no
manner
of
thing
else
like
unto
christians
when
as
socrates
saith
for
their
dissensions
and
sundry
sects
they
were
laughed
and
jested
at
openly
of
the
people
in
the
common
when
as
constantine
the
emperor
affirmeth
there
were
such
a
number
of
variances
and
brawlings
in
the
church
that
it
might
justly
seem
a
misery
far
passing
all
the
former
miseries
when
also
theophilus
epiphanius
chrysostom
augustine
ruffine
hierom
being
all
christians
being
all
fathers
being
all
catholics
did
strive
one
against
another
with
most
bitter
and
remediless
contentions
without
end
when
as
saith
nazianzen
the
parts
of
one
body
were
consumed
and
wasted
one
of
another
when
the
east
part
was
divided
from
the
west
only
for
leavened
bread
and
only
for
keeping
of
easter
day
which
were
indeed
no
great
matters
to
be
strived
for
and
when
in
all
councils
new
creeds
and
new
decrees
continually
were
devised
what
would
these
men
trow
ye
have
said
in
those
days
which
side
would
they
specially
then
have
taken
and
which
would
they
then
have
forsaken
which
gospel
would
they
have
believed
whom
would
they
have
accounted
for
heretics
and
whom
for
catholics
and
yet
what
a
stir
and
revel
keep
they
at
this
time
upon
two
poor
names
only
of
luther
and
zuinglius
because
these
two
men
do
not
yet
fully
agree
upon
some
one
point
therefore
would
they
needs
have
us
think
that
both
of
them
were
deceived
that
neither
of
them
had
the
gospel
and
that
neither
of
them
taught
the
truth
aright
but
good
god
what
manner
of
fellows
be
these
which
blame
us
for
disagreeing
and
do
all
they
themselves
ween
you
agree
well
together
is
every
one
of
them
fully
resolved
what
to
follow
hath
there
been
no
strifes
no
debates
no
quarrels
among
them
at
no
time
why
then
do
the
scotists
and
the
thomists
about
that
they
call
and
no
better
agree
together
why
agree
they
no
better
among
themselves
concerning
original
sin
in
the
blessed
virgin
concerning
a
solemn
vow
and
a
single
vow
why
say
the
canonists
that
auricular
confession
is
appointed
by
the
positive
law
of
man
and
the
schoolmen
contrariwise
that
it
is
appointed
by
the
law
of
god
why
doth
albertus
pighius
dissent
from
cajetanus
why
doth
thomas
dissent
from
lombardus
scotus
from
thomas
occamus
from
scotus
alliacensis
ed
alliensis
from
occamus
and
why
do
the
nominals
disagree
from
the
reals
and
yet
say
i
nothing
of
so
many
diversities
of
friars
and
monks
how
some
of
them
put
a
great
holiness
in
eating
of
fish
and
some
in
eating
of
herbs
some
in
wearing
of
shoes
and
some
in
wearing
of
sandals
some
in
going
in
a
linen
garment
and
some
in
a
woollen
some
of
them
called
white
some
black
some
being
shaven
broad
and
some
narrow
some
stalking
abroad
upon
pattens
some
barefooted
some
girt
and
some
ungirt
they
ought
i
wiss
to
remember
how
there
be
some
of
their
own
company
which
say
that
the
body
of
christ
is
in
his
supper
naturally
contrary
other
some
of
the
company
deny
it
to
be
so
again
that
there
be
other
of
them
which
say
the
body
of
christ
in
the
holy
communion
is
rent
and
torn
with
our
teeth
and
some
again
that
deny
the
same
some
also
of
them
there
be
which
write
that
the
body
of
christ
is
in
the
eucharistia
that
is
to
say
hath
his
perfect
quantity
in
the
sacrament
some
other
again
say
nay
that
there
be
others
of
them
which
say
christ
did
consecrate
with
a
certain
divine
power
some
that
he
did
the
same
with
his
blessing
some
again
that
say
he
did
it
with
uttering
five
solemn
chosen
words
and
some
with
rehearsing
the
same
words
afterward
again
some
will
have
it
that
when
christ
did
speak
those
five
words
the
material
wheaten
bread
was
pointed
by
this
demonstrative
pronoun
some
had
rather
have
that
a
certain
as
they
term
it
was
meant
thereby
again
others
there
be
that
say
dogs
and
mice
may
truly
and
in
very
deed
eat
the
body
of
christ
and
others
again
there
be
that
steadfastly
deny
it
there
be
others
which
say
that
the
very
accidents
of
bread
and
wine
may
nourish
others
again
there
be
which
say
how
that
the
substance
of
bread
doth
return
again
what
need
i
say
more
it
were
overlong
and
tedious
to
reckon
up
all
things
so
very
uncertain
and
full
of
controversies
is
yet
the
whole
form
of
these
men
religion
and
doctrine
even
amongst
themselves
from
whence
it
did
first
spring
and
begin
for
hardly
at
any
time
do
they
well
agree
between
themselves
except
it
be
peradventure
as
in
times
past
the
pharisees
and
sadducees
or
as
herod
and
pilate
did
accord
against
christ
they
were
best
therefore
to
go
and
set
peace
at
home
rather
among
their
own
selves
of
a
truth
unity
and
concord
doth
best
become
religion
yet
is
not
unity
the
sure
and
certain
mark
whereby
to
know
the
church
of
god
for
there
was
the
greatest
consent
that
might
be
amongst
them
that
worshipped
the
golden
calf
and
among
them
which
with
one
voice
jointly
cried
against
our
saviour
jesus
christ
crucify
him
neither
because
the
corinthians
were
unquieted
with
private
dissensions
or
because
paul
did
square
with
peter
or
barnabas
with
paul
or
because
the
christians
upon
the
very
beginning
of
the
gospel
were
at
mutual
discord
touching
some
one
matter
or
other
may
we
therefore
think
there
was
no
church
of
god
amongst
them
and
as
for
those
persons
whom
they
upon
spite
call
zuinglians
and
lutherians
in
very
deed
they
of
both
sides
be
christians
good
friends
and
brethren
they
vary
not
betwixt
themselves
upon
the
principles
and
foundations
of
our
religion
nor
as
touching
god
nor
christ
nor
the
holy
ghost
nor
of
the
means
of
justification
nor
yet
everlasting
life
but
upon
one
only
question
which
is
neither
weighty
nor
great
neither
mistrust
we
or
make
doubt
at
all
but
they
will
shortly
be
agreed
and
if
there
be
any
of
them
which
have
other
opinion
than
is
meet
we
doubt
not
but
ere
it
be
long
they
will
put
apart
all
affections
and
names
of
parties
and
that
god
will
reveal
it
unto
them
so
that
by
better
considering
and
searching
out
of
the
matter
as
once
it
came
to
pass
in
the
council
of
chalcedon
all
causes
and
seeds
of
dissension
shall
be
thoroughly
plucked
up
by
the
root
and
be
buried
and
quite
forgotten
for
ever
which
god
grant
but
this
is
the
most
grievous
and
heavy
case
that
they
call
us
wicked
and
ungodly
men
and
say
we
have
thrown
away
all
care
of
religion
though
this
ought
not
to
trouble
us
much
whilst
they
themselves
that
thus
have
charged
us
know
full
well
how
spiteful
and
false
a
saying
it
is
for
justin
the
martyr
is
a
witness
how
that
all
christians
were
called
greek
text
that
is
godless
as
soon
as
the
gospel
first
began
to
be
published
and
the
name
of
christ
to
be
openly
declared
and
when
polycarpus
stood
to
be
judged
the
people
stirred
up
the
president
to
slay
and
murder
all
them
which
professed
the
gospel
with
these
words
greek
text
that
is
to
say
rid
out
of
the
way
these
wicked
and
godless
creatures
and
this
was
not
because
it
was
true
that
the
christians
were
godless
but
because
they
would
not
worship
stones
and
stocks
which
were
then
honoured
as
god
the
whole
world
seeth
plainly
enough
already
what
we
and
ours
have
endured
at
these
men
hands
for
religion
and
our
only
god
cause
they
have
thrown
us
into
prison
into
water
into
fire
and
imbrued
themselves
in
our
blood
not
because
we
were
either
adulterers
or
robbers
or
murderers
but
only
for
that
we
confessed
the
gospel
of
jesu
christ
and
put
our
confidence
in
the
living
god
and
for
that
we
complained
too
justly
and
truly
lord
thou
knowest
that
they
did
break
the
law
of
god
for
their
own
most
vain
traditions
and
that
our
adversaries
were
the
very
foes
to
the
gospel
and
enemies
to
christ
cross
who
so
wittingly
and
willingly
did
obstinately
despise
god
commandments
wherefore
when
these
men
saw
they
could
not
rightly
find
fault
with
our
doctrine
they
would
needs
pick
a
quarrel
and
inveigh
and
rail
against
our
manners
surmising
how
that
we
do
condemn
all
that
we
set
open
the
door
to
all
licentiousness
and
lust
and
lead
away
the
people
from
all
love
of
virtue
and
in
very
deed
the
life
of
all
men
even
of
the
devoutest
and
most
christian
both
is
and
evermore
hath
been
such
as
one
may
always
find
some
lack
even
in
the
very
best
and
purest
conversation
and
such
is
the
inclination
of
all
creatures
unto
evil
and
the
readiness
of
all
men
to
suspect
that
the
things
which
neither
have
been
done
nor
once
meant
to
be
done
yet
may
be
easily
both
heard
and
credited
for
true
and
like
as
a
small
spot
is
soon
espied
in
the
neatest
and
whitest
garment
even
so
the
least
stain
of
dishonesty
is
easily
found
out
in
the
purest
and
sincerest
life
neither
take
we
all
them
which
have
at
this
day
embraced
the
doctrine
of
the
gospel
to
be
angels
and
to
live
clearly
without
any
mote
or
wrinkle
nor
yet
think
we
these
men
either
so
blind
that
if
anything
may
be
noted
in
us
they
are
not
able
to
perceive
the
same
even
through
the
least
crevice
nor
so
friendly
that
they
will
construe
aught
to
the
best
nor
yet
so
honest
of
nature
nor
courteous
that
they
will
look
back
upon
themselves
and
weigh
our
fashions
by
their
own
if
so
be
we
list
to
search
this
matter
from
the
bottom
we
know
in
the
very
apostles
times
there
were
christians
through
whom
the
name
of
the
lord
was
blasphemed
and
evil
spoken
of
among
the
gentiles
constantius
the
emperor
bewaileth
as
it
is
written
in
sozomenus
that
many
waxed
worse
after
they
had
fallen
to
the
religion
of
christ
and
cyprian
in
a
lamentable
oration
setteth
out
the
corrupt
manners
in
his
time
the
wholesome
discipline
saith
he
which
the
apostles
left
unto
us
hath
idleness
and
long
rest
now
utterly
marred
everyone
studied
to
increase
his
livelihood
and
clean
forgetting
either
what
they
had
done
before
whilst
they
were
under
the
apostles
or
what
they
ought
continually
to
do
having
received
the
faith
they
earnestly
laboured
to
make
great
their
own
wealth
with
an
unsatiable
desire
of
covetousness
there
is
no
devout
religion
saith
he
in
priests
no
sound
faith
in
ministers
no
charity
showed
in
good
works
no
form
of
godliness
in
their
conditions
men
are
become
effeminate
and
beauty
is
counterfeited
and
before
his
days
said
tertullian
o
how
wretched
be
we
which
are
called
christians
at
this
time
for
we
live
as
heathens
under
the
name
of
christ
and
without
reciting
of
many
more
writers
gregory
nazianzen
speaketh
thus
of
the
pitiful
state
of
his
own
time
we
saith
he
are
in
hatred
among
the
heathen
for
our
own
sake
we
are
also
become
now
a
wonder
not
only
to
angels
and
men
but
even
to
all
the
ungodly
in
this
case
was
the
church
of
god
when
the
gospel
first
began
to
shine
and
when
the
fury
of
tyrants
was
not
as
yet
cooled
nor
the
sword
taken
off
from
the
christians
necks
surely
it
is
no
new
thing
that
men
be
but
men
although
they
be
called
by
the
name
of
christians
part
iv
but
will
these
men
i
pray
you
think
nothing
at
all
of
themselves
while
they
accuse
us
so
maliciously
and
while
they
have
leisure
to
behold
so
far
off
and
see
both
what
is
done
in
germany
and
in
england
have
they
either
forgotten
or
can
they
not
see
what
is
done
at
rome
or
be
they
our
accusers
whose
life
is
such
as
no
man
is
able
to
make
mention
thereof
but
with
shame
and
uncomeliness
our
purpose
here
is
not
to
take
in
hand
at
this
present
to
bring
to
light
and
open
to
the
world
those
things
which
were
meet
rather
to
be
hid
and
buried
with
the
workers
of
them
it
beseemeth
neither
our
religion
nor
our
modesty
nor
our
shamefastness
but
yet
he
which
giveth
commandment
that
he
should
be
called
the
vicar
of
christ
and
the
head
of
the
church
who
also
heareth
that
such
things
be
done
in
rome
who
seeth
them
who
suffereth
them
for
we
will
go
no
further
he
can
easily
consider
with
himself
what
manner
of
things
they
be
let
him
on
god
name
call
to
mind
let
him
remember
that
they
be
of
his
own
canonists
which
have
taught
the
people
that
fornication
between
single
folk
is
no
sin
as
though
they
had
fette
that
doctrine
from
mitio
in
terence
whose
words
be
it
is
no
sin
believe
me
for
a
young
man
to
haunt
harlots
let
him
remember
they
be
of
his
own
which
have
decreed
that
a
priest
ought
not
to
be
put
out
of
his
cure
for
fornication
let
him
remember
also
how
cardinal
campegius
albertus
pighius
and
others
many
more
of
his
own
have
taught
that
the
priest
which
keepeth
a
concubine
doth
live
more
holily
and
chastely
than
he
which
hath
a
wife
in
matrimony
i
trust
he
hath
not
yet
forgotten
that
there
be
many
thousands
of
common
harlots
in
rome
and
that
himself
doth
gather
yearly
of
the
same
harlots
upon
a
thirty
thousand
ducats
by
the
way
of
an
annual
pension
neither
can
he
forget
how
himself
doth
maintain
openly
brothel
houses
and
by
a
most
filthy
lucre
doth
filthily
and
lewdly
serve
his
own
lust
were
all
things
then
pure
and
holy
in
rome
when
joan
a
woman
rather
of
perfect
age
than
of
perfect
life
was
pope
there
and
bare
herself
as
the
head
of
the
church
and
after
that
for
two
whole
years
in
that
holy
see
she
had
played
the
naughty
pack
at
last
going
in
procession
about
the
city
in
the
sight
of
all
the
cardinals
and
bishops
fell
in
travail
openly
in
the
streets
but
what
need
we
rehearse
concubines
and
bawds
as
for
that
is
now
an
ordinary
and
a
gainful
sin
at
rome
for
harlots
sit
there
not
as
they
did
in
times
past
without
the
city
walls
and
with
their
faces
hid
and
covered
but
they
dwell
in
palaces
and
fair
houses
they
stray
about
in
court
and
market
and
that
with
bare
and
open
face
as
who
say
they
may
not
only
lawfully
do
it
but
ought
also
to
be
praised
for
so
doing
what
should
we
say
any
more
of
this
their
vicious
and
abominable
life
is
now
thoroughly
known
to
the
whole
world
bernard
writeth
roundly
and
truly
of
the
bishop
of
rome
house
yea
and
of
the
bishop
of
rome
himself
thy
palace
saith
he
taketh
in
good
men
but
it
maketh
none
naughty
persons
thrive
there
and
the
good
appayre
and
decay
and
whosoever
he
were
which
wrote
the
tripartite
work
annexed
to
the
council
lateranense
saith
thus
so
excessive
at
this
day
is
the
riot
as
well
in
the
prelates
and
bishops
as
in
the
clerks
and
priests
that
it
is
horrible
to
be
told
but
these
things
be
not
only
grown
in
ure
and
so
by
custom
and
continual
time
well
allowed
as
all
the
rest
of
their
doings
in
manner
be
but
they
are
now
waxen
old
and
rotten
ripe
for
who
hath
not
heard
what
a
heinous
act
peter
aloisius
pope
paul
the
third
son
committed
against
cosmus
cherius
the
bishop
of
fanum
what
john
archbishop
of
beneventum
the
pope
legate
at
venice
wrote
in
the
commendation
of
a
most
abominable
filthiness
and
how
he
set
forth
with
most
loathsome
words
and
wicked
eloquence
the
matter
which
ought
not
once
to
proceed
out
of
mouth
to
whose
ears
hath
it
not
come
that
diasius
a
spaniard
being
purposely
sent
from
rome
into
germany
so
shamefully
and
devilishly
murdered
his
own
brother
john
diasius
a
most
innocent
and
a
most
godly
man
only
because
he
had
embraced
the
gospel
of
jesu
christ
and
would
not
return
again
to
rome
but
it
may
chance
to
this
they
will
say
these
things
may
sometime
happen
in
the
best
governed
commonwealths
yea
and
against
the
wills
and
besides
there
be
good
laws
made
to
punish
such
i
grant
it
be
so
but
by
what
good
laws
i
would
know
have
these
great
mischiefs
been
punished
amongst
them
petrus
aloisius
after
he
had
done
that
notorious
act
that
i
spake
of
was
always
cherished
in
his
bosom
pope
paul
the
third
and
made
his
very
derling
diasius
after
he
had
murdered
his
own
brother
was
delivered
by
the
pope
means
to
the
end
he
might
not
be
punished
by
good
laws
john
casus
the
archbishop
of
beneventum
is
yet
alive
yea
and
liveth
at
rome
even
in
the
eyes
and
sight
of
the
most
holy
father
they
have
put
to
death
infinite
numbers
of
our
brethren
only
because
they
believed
truly
and
sincerely
in
jesu
christ
but
of
that
great
and
foul
number
of
harlots
fornicators
adulterers
what
one
have
they
at
any
time
i
say
not
killed
but
either
excommunicated
or
once
attached
why
voluptuousness
adultery
ribaldry
whoredom
murdering
of
kin
incest
and
others
more
abominable
parts
are
not
these
counted
sin
at
rome
or
if
they
be
sin
ought
christ
vicar
peter
successor
the
most
holy
father
so
lightly
and
slightly
to
bear
them
as
though
they
were
no
sin
and
that
in
the
city
of
rome
and
in
that
principal
tower
of
all
holiness
o
holy
scribes
and
pharisees
which
knew
not
this
kind
of
holiness
what
a
catholic
faith
is
this
peter
did
not
thus
teach
at
rome
paul
did
not
so
live
at
rome
they
did
not
practise
brothelry
which
these
do
openly
they
made
not
a
yearly
revenue
and
profit
of
harlots
they
suffered
no
common
adulterers
and
wicked
murderers
to
go
unpunished
they
did
not
receive
them
into
their
entire
familiarity
into
their
council
into
their
household
nor
yet
into
the
company
of
christian
men
these
men
ought
not
therefore
so
unreasonably
to
triumph
against
our
living
it
had
been
more
wisdom
for
them
either
first
to
have
proved
good
their
own
life
before
the
world
or
at
least
to
have
cloaked
it
a
little
more
cunningly
for
we
do
use
still
the
old
and
ancient
laws
and
as
much
as
men
may
do
in
the
manners
used
at
these
days
all
things
are
so
wholly
corrupt
we
diligently
and
earnestly
put
in
execution
the
ecclesiastical
discipline
we
have
not
common
of
strumpets
nor
yet
flocks
of
concubines
nor
herds
of
neither
do
we
prefer
adultery
before
matrimony
neither
do
we
exercise
beastly
sensuality
neither
do
we
gather
ordinary
rents
and
stipends
of
stews
nor
do
we
suffer
to
escape
unpunished
incest
and
abominable
naughtiness
nor
yet
such
manquellers
as
the
aloisians
casians
and
diazians
were
for
if
these
things
would
have
pleased
us
we
needed
not
to
have
departed
from
these
men
fellowship
amongst
whom
such
enormities
be
in
their
chief
pride
and
price
neither
needed
we
for
leaving
them
to
run
into
the
hatred
of
men
and
into
most
wilful
dangers
paul
the
fourth
not
many
months
sithence
had
at
rome
in
prison
certain
augustine
friars
many
bishops
and
a
great
number
of
other
devout
men
for
religion
sake
he
racked
them
and
tormented
them
to
make
them
confess
he
left
no
means
unassayed
but
in
the
end
how
many
brothels
how
many
whoremongers
how
many
adulterers
how
many
incestuous
persons
could
he
find
of
all
those
our
god
be
thanked
although
we
be
not
the
men
we
ought
and
profess
to
be
yet
whosoever
we
be
compare
us
with
these
men
and
even
our
own
life
and
innocency
will
soon
prove
untrue
and
condemn
their
malicious
surmises
for
we
exhort
the
people
to
all
virtue
and
not
only
by
books
and
preachings
but
also
with
our
examples
and
behaviour
we
also
teach
that
the
gospel
is
not
a
boasting
or
bragging
of
knowledge
but
that
it
is
the
law
of
life
and
that
a
christian
man
as
tertullian
saith
ought
not
to
speak
honourably
but
ought
to
live
honourably
nor
that
they
be
the
hearers
of
the
law
but
the
doers
of
the
law
which
are
justified
before
god
besides
all
these
matters
wherewith
they
charge
us
they
are
wont
also
to
add
this
one
thing
which
they
enlarge
with
all
kind
of
spitefulness
that
is
that
we
be
men
of
trouble
that
we
pluck
the
sword
and
sceptre
out
of
kings
hands
that
we
arm
the
people
that
we
overthrow
judgment
places
destroy
the
laws
make
havoc
of
possessions
seek
to
make
the
people
princes
turn
all
things
upside
down
and
to
be
short
that
we
would
have
nothing
in
good
frame
in
a
commonwealth
good
lord
how
often
have
they
set
on
fire
princes
hearts
with
these
words
to
the
end
they
might
quench
the
light
of
the
gospel
in
the
very
first
appearing
of
it
and
might
begin
to
hate
the
same
ere
ever
they
were
able
to
know
it
and
to
the
end
that
every
magistrate
might
think
he
saw
his
deadly
enemy
as
often
as
he
saw
any
of
us
surely
it
should
exceedingly
grieve
us
to
be
so
maliciously
accused
of
most
heinous
treason
unless
we
knew
that
christ
himself
the
apostles
and
a
number
of
good
and
christian
men
were
in
times
past
blamed
and
envied
in
manner
for
the
same
faults
for
although
christ
taught
they
should
give
unto
caesar
that
which
was
caesar
yet
was
he
charged
with
sedition
in
that
he
was
accused
to
devise
some
conspiracy
and
covet
the
kingdom
and
hereupon
they
cried
out
with
open
mouth
against
him
in
the
place
of
judgment
if
thou
let
this
man
escape
thou
art
not
friend
and
though
the
apostles
did
likewise
evermore
and
steadfastly
teach
that
magistrates
ought
to
be
obeyed
that
every
soul
ought
to
be
subject
to
the
higher
powers
not
only
for
fear
of
wrath
and
punishment
but
even
for
conscience
sake
yet
bare
they
the
name
to
disquiet
the
people
and
to
stir
up
the
multitude
to
rebel
after
this
sort
did
haman
specially
bring
the
nation
of
the
jews
into
the
hatred
of
the
king
assuerus
because
said
he
they
were
a
rebellious
and
stubborn
people
and
despised
the
ordinances
and
commandments
of
princes
wicked
king
ahab
said
to
elie
elijah
the
prophet
of
god
it
is
thou
that
troublest
israel
amasias
the
priest
at
bethel
laid
a
conspiracy
to
the
prophet
amos
charge
before
king
jeroboam
saying
see
amos
hath
made
a
conspiracy
against
thee
in
the
midst
of
the
house
of
israel
to
be
brief
tertullian
saith
this
was
the
general
accusation
of
all
christians
while
he
lived
that
they
were
traitors
they
were
rebels
and
the
enemies
of
mankind
wherefore
if
the
truth
be
likewise
evil
spoken
of
and
being
the
same
truth
it
was
then
if
it
be
now
like
despitefully
used
as
it
was
in
times
past
though
it
be
a
grievous
and
unkind
dealing
yet
can
it
not
seem
unto
us
a
new
or
an
unwonted
matter
forty
years
ago
and
upward
was
it
an
easy
thing
for
them
to
devise
against
us
these
accursed
speeches
and
other
too
sorer
than
these
when
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
of
that
age
first
began
to
spring
and
to
give
shine
some
one
glimmering
beam
of
truth
unknown
at
that
time
and
unheard
of
when
also
martin
luther
and
hulderic
zuinglius
being
most
excellent
men
even
sent
of
god
to
give
light
to
the
whole
world
first
came
unto
the
knowledge
and
preaching
of
the
gospel
whereas
yet
the
thing
was
but
new
and
the
success
thereof
uncertain
and
when
minds
stood
doubtful
and
amazed
and
their
ears
open
to
all
slanderous
tales
and
when
there
could
be
imagined
against
us
no
fact
so
detestable
but
the
people
then
would
soon
believe
it
for
the
novelty
and
strangeness
of
the
matter
for
so
did
symmachus
so
did
celsus
so
did
julianus
so
did
porphyrius
the
old
foes
to
the
gospel
attempt
in
times
past
to
accuse
all
christians
of
sedition
and
treason
before
that
either
prince
or
people
were
able
to
know
who
those
christians
were
what
they
professed
what
they
believed
or
what
was
their
meaning
but
now
sithence
our
very
enemies
do
see
and
can
not
deny
but
we
ever
in
all
our
words
and
writings
have
diligently
put
the
people
in
mind
of
their
duty
to
obey
their
princes
and
magistrates
yea
though
they
be
wicked
for
this
doth
very
trial
and
experience
sufficiently
teach
and
all
eyes
whosoever
and
wheresoever
they
be
do
well
enough
see
and
witness
for
us
it
was
a
foul
part
of
them
to
charge
us
with
these
things
yea
seeing
they
could
find
no
new
and
late
faults
therefore
to
seek
to
procure
us
envy
only
with
stale
and
out
worn
lies
we
give
our
lord
god
thanks
whose
only
cause
this
is
there
hath
yet
at
no
time
been
any
such
example
in
all
the
realms
dominions
and
commonweals
which
have
received
the
gospel
for
we
have
overthrown
no
kingdom
we
have
decayed
no
man
power
or
right
we
have
disordered
no
commonwealth
there
continue
in
their
own
accustomed
state
and
ancient
dignity
the
kings
of
our
country
of
england
the
kings
of
denmark
the
kings
of
sweden
the
dukes
of
saxony
the
counts
palatine
the
marquesses
of
brandenburg
the
landgraves
of
hesse
the
commonwealth
of
the
helvetians
and
rhaetians
and
the
free
cities
as
argentine
basil
frankfort
ulm
augusta
and
nuremberg
do
all
i
say
abide
in
the
same
authority
and
estate
wherein
they
have
been
heretofore
or
rather
in
a
much
better
for
that
by
means
of
the
gospel
they
have
their
people
more
obedient
unto
them
let
them
go
i
pray
you
into
those
places
where
at
this
present
through
god
goodness
the
gospel
is
taught
where
is
there
more
majesty
where
is
there
less
arrogancy
and
tyranny
where
be
the
prince
more
honoured
where
is
the
people
less
unruly
where
hath
there
at
any
time
the
commonwealth
or
the
church
been
in
more
quiet
perhaps
ye
will
say
from
the
first
beginning
of
this
doctrine
the
common
sort
everywhere
began
to
rage
and
to
rise
throughout
germany
allow
it
were
so
yet
martin
luther
the
publisher
and
setter
forward
of
this
doctrine
did
write
marvellous
vehemently
and
sharply
against
them
and
reclaimed
them
home
to
peace
and
obedience
but
whereas
it
is
wont
sometime
to
be
objected
by
persons
wanting
skill
touching
the
helvetians
change
of
state
and
killing
of
leopoldus
the
duke
of
austria
and
restoring
by
force
their
country
to
liberty
that
was
done
as
appeareth
plainly
by
all
stories
for
two
hundred
and
threescore
years
past
or
above
under
boniface
the
eighth
when
the
authority
of
the
bishop
of
rome
was
in
greatest
jollity
about
two
hundred
years
before
huldericus
zuinglius
either
began
to
teach
the
gospel
or
yet
was
born
and
ever
since
that
time
they
have
had
all
things
still
and
quiet
not
only
from
foreign
enemies
but
also
from
civil
dissension
and
if
it
were
a
sin
in
the
helvetians
to
deliver
their
own
country
from
foreign
government
specially
when
they
were
so
proudly
and
tyrannously
oppressed
yet
to
burden
us
with
other
faults
or
them
with
the
faults
of
their
forefathers
is
against
all
right
and
reason
but
o
immortal
god
and
will
the
bishop
of
rome
accuse
us
of
treason
will
he
teach
the
people
to
obey
and
follow
their
magistrates
or
hath
he
any
regard
at
all
of
the
majesty
of
princes
why
doth
he
then
as
none
of
the
old
bishops
of
rome
heretofore
ever
did
suffer
himself
to
be
called
of
his
flatterers
lord
of
lords
as
though
he
would
have
all
kings
and
princes
who
and
whatsoever
they
are
to
be
his
underlings
why
doth
he
vaunt
himself
to
be
king
of
kings
and
to
have
kingly
royalty
over
his
subjects
why
compelleth
he
all
emperors
and
princes
to
swear
to
him
fealty
and
true
obedience
why
doth
he
boast
that
the
majesty
is
a
thousandfold
inferior
to
him
and
for
this
reason
specially
because
god
hath
made
two
lights
in
heaven
and
because
heaven
and
earth
were
created
not
at
two
beginnings
but
in
one
why
hath
he
and
his
complices
like
anabaptists
and
libertines
to
the
end
they
might
run
on
more
licentiously
and
carelessly
shaken
off
the
yoke
and
exempted
themselves
from
being
under
a
civil
power
why
hath
he
his
legates
as
much
to
say
as
most
subtle
spies
lying
in
wait
in
all
courts
councils
and
privy
chambers
why
doth
he
when
he
list
set
christian
princes
one
against
another
and
at
his
own
pleasure
trouble
the
whole
world
with
debate
and
discord
why
doth
he
excommunicate
and
command
to
be
taken
as
a
heathen
and
a
pagan
any
christian
prince
that
renounceth
his
authority
and
why
promiseth
he
his
indulgences
and
his
pardons
so
largely
to
any
that
will
what
way
soever
it
be
kill
any
of
his
enemies
doth
he
maintain
empires
and
kingdoms
or
doth
he
once
desire
that
common
quiet
should
be
provided
for
you
must
pardon
us
good
reader
though
we
seem
to
utter
these
things
more
bitterly
and
bitingly
than
it
becometh
divines
to
do
for
both
the
shamefulness
of
the
matter
and
the
desire
of
rule
in
the
bishop
of
rome
is
so
exceeding
and
outrageous
that
it
could
not
well
be
uttered
with
other
words
or
more
mildly
for
he
is
not
ashamed
to
say
in
open
assembly
that
all
jurisdiction
of
all
kings
doth
depend
upon
himself
and
to
feed
his
ambition
and
greediness
of
rule
he
hath
pulled
in
pieces
the
empire
of
rome
and
vexed
and
rent
whole
christendom
asunder
falsely
and
traitorously
also
did
he
release
the
romans
the
italians
and
himself
too
of
the
oath
whereby
they
and
he
were
straitly
bound
to
be
true
to
the
emperor
of
greece
and
stirred
up
the
emperor
subjects
to
forsake
him
and
calling
carolus
martellus
out
of
france
into
italy
made
him
emperor
such
a
thing
as
never
was
seen
before
he
put
chilpericus
the
french
king
being
no
evil
prince
beside
his
realm
only
because
he
fancied
him
not
and
wrongfully
placed
pipin
in
his
room
again
after
he
had
cast
out
king
philip
if
he
could
have
brought
it
to
pass
he
had
determined
and
appointed
the
kingdom
of
france
to
albertus
king
of
romans
he
utterly
destroyed
the
state
of
the
most
nourishing
city
and
commonweal
of
florence
his
own
native
country
and
brought
it
out
of
a
free
and
peaceable
state
to
be
governed
at
the
pleasure
of
one
man
he
brought
to
pass
by
his
procurement
that
whole
savoy
on
the
one
side
was
miserably
spoiled
by
the
emperor
charles
the
fifth
and
on
the
other
side
by
the
french
king
so
as
the
unfortunate
duke
had
scant
one
city
left
him
to
hide
his
head
in
we
are
cloyed
with
examples
in
this
behalf
and
it
should
be
very
tedious
to
reckon
up
all
the
notorious
deeds
of
the
bishops
of
rome
of
which
side
were
they
i
beseech
you
which
poisoned
henry
the
emperor
even
in
the
receiving
of
the
sacrament
which
poisoned
victor
the
pope
even
in
the
receiving
of
the
chalice
which
poisoned
our
king
john
king
of
england
in
a
drinking
cup
whosoever
at
least
they
were
and
of
what
sect
soever
i
am
sure
they
were
neither
lutherans
nor
zuinglians
what
is
he
at
this
day
which
alloweth
the
mightiest
kings
and
monarchs
of
the
world
to
kiss
his
blessed
feet
what
is
he
that
commandeth
the
emperor
to
go
by
him
at
his
horse
bridle
and
the
french
king
to
hold
his
stirrup
who
hurled
under
his
table
francis
dandalus
the
duke
of
venice
king
of
crete
and
cyprus
fast
bound
with
chains
to
feed
of
bones
among
his
dogs
who
set
the
imperial
crown
upon
the
emperor
henry
the
head
not
with
his
hand
but
with
his
foot
and
with
the
same
foot
again
cast
the
same
crown
off
saying
withal
he
had
power
to
make
emperors
and
to
unmake
them
again
at
his
pleasure
who
put
in
arms
henry
the
son
against
the
emperor
his
father
henry
the
fourth
and
wrought
so
that
the
father
was
taken
prisoner
of
his
own
son
and
being
shorn
and
shamefully
handled
was
thrust
into
a
monastery
where
with
hunger
and
sorrow
he
pined
away
to
death
who
so
and
monstrously
put
the
emperor
frederick
neck
under
his
feet
and
as
though
that
were
not
sufficient
added
further
this
text
out
of
the
psalms
thou
shalt
go
upon
the
adder
and
cockatrice
and
shalt
tread
the
lion
and
dragon
under
thy
feet
such
an
example
of
scorning
and
contemning
a
majesty
as
never
before
that
was
heard
tell
of
in
any
remembrance
except
i
ween
either
of
tamerlane
the
king
of
scythia
a
wild
and
barbarous
creature
or
else
of
sapor
king
of
the
persians
all
these
notwithstanding
were
popes
all
peter
successors
all
most
holy
fathers
whose
several
words
we
must
take
to
be
as
good
as
several
gospels
if
we
be
counted
traitors
which
do
honour
our
princes
which
give
them
all
obedience
as
much
as
is
due
to
them
by
god
word
and
which
do
pray
for
them
what
kind
of
men
then
be
these
which
have
not
only
done
all
the
things
before
said
but
also
allow
the
same
for
specially
well
done
do
they
then
either
this
way
instruct
the
people
as
we
do
to
reverence
their
magistrate
or
can
they
with
honesty
appeach
us
as
seditious
persons
breakers
of
the
common
quiet
and
despisers
of
princes
majesty
truly
we
neither
put
off
the
yoke
of
obedience
from
us
neither
do
we
disorder
realms
neither
do
we
set
up
or
pull
down
kings
nor
translate
governments
nor
give
our
kings
poison
to
drink
nor
yet
hold
to
them
our
feet
to
be
kissed
nor
opprobriously
triumphing
over
them
leap
into
their
necks
with
our
feet
this
rather
is
our
profession
this
is
our
doctrine
that
every
soul
of
what
calling
soever
he
be
be
he
monk
be
he
preacher
be
he
prophet
be
he
apostle
ought
to
be
subject
to
kings
and
magistrates
yea
and
that
the
bishop
of
rome
himself
unless
he
will
seem
greater
than
evangelists
than
the
prophets
or
the
apostles
ought
both
to
acknowledge
and
to
call
the
emperor
his
lord
and
master
which
the
old
bishops
of
rome
who
lived
in
times
of
more
grace
ever
did
our
common
teaching
also
is
that
we
ought
so
to
obey
princes
as
men
sent
of
god
and
that
whoso
withstandeth
them
withstandeth
god
ordinance
this
is
our
showing
and
this
is
well
to
be
seen
both
in
our
books
and
in
our
preachings
and
also
in
the
manners
and
modest
behaviour
of
our
people
but
where
they
say
we
have
gone
away
from
the
unity
of
the
catholic
church
this
is
not
only
a
matter
of
malice
but
besides
though
it
be
most
untrue
yet
hath
it
some
show
and
appearance
of
truth
for
the
common
people
and
ignorant
multitude
give
not
credit
alone
to
things
true
and
of
certainty
but
even
to
such
things
also
if
any
chance
which
may
seem
to
have
but
a
resemblance
of
truth
therefore
we
see
that
subtle
and
crafty
persons
when
they
had
no
truth
on
their
side
have
ever
contended
and
hotly
argued
with
things
likely
to
be
true
to
the
intent
they
which
were
not
able
to
espy
the
very
ground
of
the
matter
might
be
carried
away
at
least
with
some
pretence
and
probability
thereof
in
times
past
where
the
first
christians
our
forefathers
in
making
their
prayers
to
god
did
turn
themselves
towards
the
east
there
were
that
said
they
worshipped
the
sun
and
reckoned
it
as
god
again
where
our
forefathers
said
that
as
touching
immortal
and
everlasting
life
they
lived
by
no
other
means
but
by
the
flesh
and
blood
of
that
lamb
who
was
without
spot
that
is
to
say
of
our
saviour
jesus
christ
the
envious
creatures
and
foes
of
christ
cross
whose
only
care
was
to
bring
christian
religion
into
slander
by
all
manner
of
ways
made
people
believe
that
they
were
wicked
persons
that
they
sacrificed
men
flesh
and
drunk
men
blood
also
where
our
forefathers
said
that
before
god
there
is
neither
man
nor
woman
nor
for
attaining
to
the
true
righteousness
there
is
no
distinction
at
all
of
persons
and
that
they
did
call
one
another
indifferently
by
the
name
of
sisters
and
brothers
there
wanted
not
men
which
forged
false
tales
upon
the
same
saying
that
the
christians
made
no
difference
among
themselves
either
of
age
or
of
kind
but
like
brute
beasts
without
regard
had
to
do
one
with
another
and
where
for
to
pray
and
hear
the
gospel
they
met
often
together
in
secret
and
bye
places
because
rebels
sometime
were
wont
to
do
the
like
rumours
were
everywhere
spread
abroad
how
they
made
privy
confederacies
and
counselled
together
either
to
kill
the
magistrates
or
to
subvert
the
commonwealth
and
where
in
celebrating
the
holy
mysteries
after
christ
institution
they
took
bread
and
wine
they
were
thought
of
many
not
to
worship
christ
but
bacchus
and
ceres
forsomuch
as
those
vain
gods
were
worshipped
of
the
heathens
in
like
sort
after
a
profane
superstition
with
bread
and
wine
these
things
were
believed
of
many
not
because
they
were
true
indeed
for
what
could
be
more
untrue
but
because
they
were
like
to
be
true
and
through
a
certain
shadow
of
truth
might
the
more
easily
deceive
the
simple
on
this
fashion
likewise
do
these
men
slander
us
as
heretics
and
say
that
we
have
left
the
church
and
fellowship
of
christ
not
because
they
think
it
is
true
for
they
do
not
much
force
of
that
but
because
to
ignorant
folk
it
might
perhaps
some
way
appear
true
we
have
indeed
put
ourselves
apart
not
as
heretics
are
wont
from
the
church
of
christ
but
as
all
good
men
ought
to
do
from
the
infection
of
naughty
persons
and
hypocrites
nevertheless
in
this
point
they
triumph
marvellously
that
they
be
the
church
that
their
church
is
christ
spouse
the
pillar
of
truth
the
ark
of
noah
and
that
without
it
there
is
no
hope
of
salvation
contrariwise
they
say
that
we
be
renegades
that
we
have
torn
seat
that
we
are
plucked
quite
off
from
the
body
of
christ
and
have
forsaken
the
catholic
faith
and
when
they
leave
nothing
unspoken
that
may
never
so
falsely
and
maliciously
be
said
against
us
yet
this
one
thing
are
they
never
able
truly
to
say
that
we
have
swerved
either
from
the
word
of
god
or
from
the
apostles
of
christ
or
from
the
primitive
church
surely
we
have
ever
judged
the
primitive
church
of
time
of
the
apostles
and
of
the
holy
fathers
to
be
the
catholic
church
neither
make
we
doubt
to
name
it
noah
ark
christ
spouse
the
pillar
and
upholder
of
all
truth
nor
yet
to
fix
therein
the
whole
mean
of
our
salvation
it
is
doubtless
an
odious
matter
for
one
to
leave
the
fellowship
whereunto
he
hath
been
accustomed
and
specially
of
those
men
who
though
they
be
not
yet
at
least
seem
and
be
called
christians
and
to
say
truly
we
do
not
despise
the
church
of
these
men
howsoever
it
be
ordered
by
them
partly
for
the
name
sake
itself
and
partly
for
that
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
hath
once
been
therein
truly
and
purely
set
forth
neither
had
we
departed
therefrom
but
of
very
necessity
and
much
against
our
wills
but
i
put
case
an
idol
be
set
up
in
the
church
of
god
and
the
same
desolation
which
christ
prophesied
to
come
stood
openly
in
the
holy
place
what
if
some
thief
or
pirate
invade
and
possess
noah
ark
these
folks
as
often
as
they
tell
us
of
the
church
mean
thereby
themselves
alone
and
attribute
all
these
titles
to
their
own
selves
boasting
as
they
did
in
times
past
which
cried
the
temple
of
the
lord
the
temple
of
the
lord
or
as
the
pharisees
and
scribes
did
which
craked
they
were
abraham
children
thus
with
a
gay
and
jolly
show
deceive
they
the
simple
and
seek
to
choke
us
with
the
very
name
of
the
church
much
like
as
if
a
thief
when
he
had
gotten
into
another
man
house
and
by
violence
either
hath
thrust
out
or
slain
the
owner
should
afterward
assign
the
same
house
to
himself
casting
forth
of
possession
the
right
inheritor
or
if
when
he
had
once
entered
into
the
temple
of
god
should
afterward
say
this
house
is
mine
own
and
christ
hath
nothing
to
do
withal
for
these
men
now
after
they
have
left
nothing
remaining
in
the
church
of
god
that
hath
any
likeness
of
this
church
yet
will
they
seem
the
patrons
and
valiant
maintainers
of
the
church
very
like
as
gracchus
amongst
the
romans
stood
in
defence
of
the
treasury
notwithstanding
with
his
prodigality
and
fond
expenses
he
had
utterly
wasted
the
whole
stock
of
the
treasury
and
yet
was
there
never
anything
so
wicked
or
so
far
out
of
reason
but
lightly
it
might
be
covered
and
defended
by
the
name
of
the
church
for
the
wasps
also
make
as
well
as
bees
and
wicked
men
have
companies
like
to
the
church
of
god
yet
for
all
that
they
be
not
straightway
the
people
of
god
which
are
called
the
people
of
god
neither
be
they
all
israelites
as
many
as
are
come
of
israel
the
father
the
arians
notwithstanding
they
were
heretics
yet
bragged
they
that
they
alone
were
catholics
calling
all
the
rest
now
ambrosians
now
athanasians
now
johannites
and
nestorius
as
saith
theodoret
for
all
that
he
was
an
heretic
yet
covered
he
himself
greek
text
that
is
to
wit
with
a
certain
cloak
and
colour
of
the
true
and
right
faith
ebion
though
he
agreed
in
opinion
with
the
samaritans
yet
as
saith
epiphanius
he
would
needs
be
called
a
christian
the
mahometists
at
this
day
for
all
that
all
histories
make
plain
mention
and
themselves
also
can
not
deny
but
they
took
their
first
beginning
of
agar
the
yet
for
the
very
name
and
sake
chose
they
rather
to
be
called
saracens
as
though
they
came
of
sarah
the
free
woman
and
abraham
wife
so
likewise
the
false
prophets
of
all
ages
which
stood
up
against
the
prophets
of
god
which
resisted
esaias
jeremy
christ
and
the
apostles
at
no
time
craked
of
anything
so
much
as
they
did
of
the
name
of
the
church
and
for
no
other
cause
did
they
so
fiercely
vex
them
and
call
them
runaways
and
apostates
than
for
that
they
forsook
their
fellowship
and
kept
not
the
ordinances
of
the
elders
wherefore
if
we
would
follow
the
judgments
of
those
men
only
who
then
governed
the
church
and
would
respect
nothing
else
neither
god
nor
his
word
it
must
needs
be
confessed
that
the
apostles
were
rightly
and
by
just
law
condemned
of
them
to
death
because
they
fell
from
the
bishops
and
priests
that
is
you
must
think
from
the
catholic
church
and
because
they
made
many
new
alterations
in
religion
contrary
to
the
bishops
and
priests
wills
yea
and
for
all
their
spurning
so
earnestly
against
it
wherefore
like
as
it
is
written
that
hercules
in
old
time
was
forced
in
striving
with
antaeus
that
huge
giant
to
lift
him
quite
up
from
the
earth
that
was
his
mother
ere
he
could
conquer
him
even
so
must
our
adversaries
be
heaved
from
their
mother
that
is
from
this
vain
colour
and
shadow
of
the
church
wherewith
they
so
disguise
and
defend
themselves
otherwise
they
can
not
be
brought
to
yield
unto
the
word
of
god
and
therefore
saith
jeremy
the
prophet
make
not
such
great
boast
that
the
temple
of
the
lord
is
with
you
this
is
but
a
vain
confidence
these
are
lies
the
angel
also
saith
in
the
apocalypse
they
say
they
be
jews
but
they
be
the
synagogue
of
satan
and
christ
said
to
the
pharisees
when
they
vaunted
themselves
of
the
kindred
and
blood
of
abraham
ye
are
of
your
father
the
devil
for
you
resemble
not
your
father
abraham
as
much
to
say
as
ye
are
not
the
men
ye
would
so
fain
be
called
ye
beguile
the
people
with
vain
titles
and
abuse
the
name
of
the
church
to
the
overthrowing
of
the
church
so
that
these
men
part
had
been
first
to
have
clearly
and
truly
proved
that
the
romish
church
is
the
true
and
right
instructed
church
of
god
and
that
the
same
as
they
do
order
it
at
this
day
doth
agree
with
the
primitive
church
of
christ
of
the
apostles
and
of
the
holy
fathers
which
we
doubt
not
but
was
indeed
the
true
catholic
church
for
our
parts
if
we
could
have
judged
ignorance
error
superstition
idolatry
men
inventions
and
the
same
commonly
disagreeing
with
the
holy
scriptures
either
to
please
god
or
to
be
sufficient
for
the
obtaining
everlasting
salvation
or
if
we
could
ascertain
ourselves
that
the
word
of
god
was
written
but
for
a
time
only
and
afterward
again
ought
to
be
abrogated
and
put
away
or
else
that
the
sayings
and
commandments
of
god
ought
to
be
subject
to
man
will
that
whatsoever
god
saith
and
commandeth
except
the
bishop
of
rome
willeth
and
commandeth
the
same
it
must
be
taken
as
void
and
unspoken
if
we
could
have
brought
ourselves
to
believe
these
things
we
grant
there
had
been
no
cause
at
all
why
we
should
have
left
these
men
company
as
touching
that
we
have
now
done
to
depart
from
that
church
whose
errors
were
proved
and
made
manifest
to
the
world
which
church
also
had
already
evidently
departed
from
word
and
yet
not
to
depart
so
much
from
itself
as
from
the
errors
thereof
and
not
to
do
this
disorderly
or
wickedly
but
quietly
and
soberly
we
have
done
nothing
herein
against
the
doctrine
either
of
christ
or
of
his
apostles
for
neither
is
the
church
of
god
such
as
it
may
not
be
dusked
with
some
spot
or
asketh
not
sometime
reparation
else
what
needeth
there
so
many
assemblies
and
councils
without
the
which
as
saith
aegidius
the
christian
faith
is
not
able
to
stand
for
look
saith
he
how
often
councils
are
discontinued
so
often
is
the
church
destitute
of
christ
or
if
there
be
no
peril
that
harm
may
come
to
the
church
what
need
is
there
to
retain
to
no
purpose
the
names
of
bishops
as
is
now
commonly
used
among
them
for
if
there
be
no
sheep
that
may
stray
why
be
they
called
shepherds
if
there
be
no
city
that
may
be
betrayed
why
be
they
called
watchmen
if
there
be
nothing
that
may
run
to
ruin
why
be
they
called
pillars
anon
after
the
first
creation
of
the
world
the
church
of
god
began
to
spread
abroad
and
the
same
was
instructed
with
the
heavenly
word
which
god
himself
pronounced
with
his
own
mouth
it
was
also
furnished
with
divine
ceremonies
it
was
taught
by
the
spirit
of
god
by
the
patriarchs
and
prophets
and
continued
so
even
till
the
time
that
christ
showed
himself
to
us
in
the
flesh
this
notwithstanding
how
often
o
good
god
in
the
meanwhile
and
how
horribly
was
the
same
church
darkened
and
decayed
where
was
that
church
then
when
all
flesh
upon
earth
had
denied
their
own
way
where
was
it
when
amongst
the
number
of
the
whole
world
there
were
only
eight
persons
and
they
neither
all
chaste
and
good
whom
god
will
was
should
be
saved
alive
from
that
universal
destruction
and
mortality
when
elie
the
prophet
so
lamentably
and
bitterly
made
moan
that
only
himself
was
left
of
all
the
whole
world
which
did
truly
and
duly
worship
god
and
when
esay
said
the
silver
of
god
people
that
is
of
the
church
was
become
dross
and
that
the
same
city
which
aforetime
had
been
faithful
was
now
become
a
harlot
and
that
in
the
same
there
was
no
part
sound
throughout
the
whole
body
from
the
head
to
the
foot
or
else
when
christ
himself
said
that
the
house
of
god
was
made
by
the
pharisees
and
priests
a
den
of
thieves
of
a
truth
the
church
even
as
a
except
it
be
eared
manured
tilled
and
trimmed
instead
of
wheat
it
will
bring
forth
thistles
darnel
and
nettles
for
this
cause
did
god
send
ever
among
both
prophets
and
apostles
and
last
of
all
his
own
son
who
might
bring
home
the
people
into
the
right
way
and
repair
anew
the
tottering
church
after
she
had
erred
but
lest
some
man
should
say
that
the
aforesaid
things
happened
in
the
time
of
the
law
only
of
shadows
and
of
infancy
when
truth
lay
hid
under
figures
and
ceremonies
when
nothing
as
yet
was
brought
to
perfection
when
the
law
was
not
graven
in
men
hearts
but
in
stone
and
yet
is
that
but
a
foolish
saying
for
even
at
those
days
was
there
the
very
same
god
that
is
now
the
same
spirit
the
same
christ
the
same
faith
the
same
doctrine
the
same
hope
the
same
inheritance
the
same
league
and
the
same
efficacy
and
virtue
of
god
word
eusebius
also
saith
all
the
faithful
even
from
adam
until
christ
were
in
very
deed
christians
though
they
were
not
so
termed
but
as
i
said
lest
men
should
thus
speak
still
paul
the
apostle
found
the
like
faults
and
falls
even
then
in
the
prime
and
chief
of
the
gospel
in
chief
perfection
and
in
the
light
so
that
he
was
compelled
to
write
in
this
sort
to
the
galatians
whom
he
had
well
before
that
instructed
i
fear
me
quoth
he
lest
i
have
laboured
among
you
in
vain
and
lest
ye
have
heard
the
gospel
in
vain
o
my
little
children
of
whom
i
travail
anew
till
christ
be
fashioned
again
in
you
and
as
for
the
church
of
the
corinthians
how
foully
it
was
denied
is
nothing
needful
to
rehearse
now
tell
me
might
the
churches
of
the
galatians
and
corinthians
go
amiss
and
the
church
of
rome
alone
may
not
fail
nor
go
amiss
surely
christ
prophesied
long
before
of
his
church
that
the
time
should
come
when
desolation
should
stand
in
the
holy
place
and
paul
saith
that
antichrist
should
once
set
up
his
own
tabernacle
and
stately
seat
in
the
temple
of
god
and
that
the
time
should
be
when
men
should
not
away
with
wholesome
doctrine
but
be
turned
back
unto
fables
and
lies
and
that
within
the
very
church
peter
likewise
telleth
how
there
should
be
teachers
of
lies
in
the
church
of
christ
daniel
the
prophet
speaking
of
the
latter
times
of
antichrist
truth
saith
he
in
that
season
shall
be
thrown
under
foot
and
trodden
upon
in
the
world
and
christ
saith
how
the
calamity
and
confusion
of
things
shall
be
so
exceeding
great
that
even
the
chosen
if
it
were
possible
shall
be
brought
into
error
and
how
all
these
things
shall
come
to
pass
not
amongst
gentiles
and
turks
but
that
they
should
be
in
the
holy
place
in
the
temple
of
god
in
the
church
and
in
the
company
and
fellowship
of
those
which
profess
the
name
of
christ
albeit
these
same
warnings
alone
may
suffice
a
wise
man
to
take
heed
he
do
not
suffer
himself
rashly
to
be
deceived
with
the
name
of
the
church
and
not
to
stay
to
make
further
inquisition
thereof
by
god
word
yet
beside
all
this
many
fathers
also
many
learned
and
godly
men
have
often
and
carefully
complained
how
all
these
things
have
chanced
in
their
lifetime
for
even
in
the
midst
of
that
thick
mist
of
darkness
god
would
yet
there
should
be
some
who
though
they
gave
not
a
clear
and
bright
light
yet
should
they
kindle
were
it
but
some
spark
which
men
might
espy
being
in
the
darkness
hilarius
when
things
as
yet
were
almost
uncorrupt
and
in
good
ease
too
ye
are
ill
deceived
saith
he
with
the
love
of
walls
ye
do
ill
worship
the
church
in
that
ye
worship
it
in
houses
and
buildings
ye
do
ill
bring
in
the
name
of
peace
under
roofs
is
there
any
doubt
but
antichrist
will
have
his
seat
under
the
same
i
rather
reckon
hills
woods
pools
marshes
prisons
and
quagmires
to
be
places
of
more
safety
for
in
these
the
prophets
either
abiding
of
their
accord
or
forced
thither
by
violence
did
prophesy
by
the
spirit
of
god
gregory
as
one
which
perceived
and
foresaw
in
his
mind
the
wrack
of
all
things
wrote
thus
to
john
bishop
of
constantinople
the
first
of
all
others
that
commanded
himself
to
be
called
by
this
new
name
the
universal
bishop
of
whole
christ
church
if
the
church
saith
he
shall
depend
upon
one
man
it
will
at
once
fall
down
to
the
ground
who
is
he
that
seeth
not
how
this
is
come
to
pass
long
since
for
long
agone
hath
the
bishop
of
rome
willed
to
have
the
whole
church
depend
upon
himself
alone
wherefore
it
is
no
marvel
though
it
be
clean
fallen
down
long
agone
bernard
the
abbot
above
four
hundred
years
past
writeth
thus
nothing
is
now
of
sincerity
and
pureness
amongst
the
clergy
wherefore
it
resteth
that
the
man
of
sin
should
be
revealed
the
same
bernard
in
his
work
of
the
conversion
of
paul
it
seemeth
now
saith
he
that
persecution
hath
ceased
no
no
persecution
seemeth
but
now
to
begin
even
from
them
which
have
chief
in
the
church
thy
friends
and
neighbours
have
drawn
near
and
stood
up
against
thee
from
the
sole
of
thy
foot
to
the
crown
of
thy
head
there
is
no
part
whole
iniquity
is
proceeded
from
the
elders
the
judges
and
deputies
which
pretend
to
rule
thy
people
we
can
not
say
now
look
how
the
people
be
so
is
the
priest
for
the
people
is
not
so
ill
as
the
priest
is
alas
alas
o
lord
god
the
selfsame
persons
be
the
chief
in
persecuting
thee
which
seem
to
love
the
highest
place
and
bear
most
rule
in
thy
church
the
same
bernard
again
upon
the
canticles
writeth
thus
all
they
are
thy
friends
yet
are
they
all
thy
foes
all
thy
kinsfolk
yet
are
they
all
thy
adversaries
being
christ
servants
they
serve
antichrist
behold
in
my
rest
my
bitterness
is
most
bitter
roger
bacon
also
a
man
of
great
fame
after
he
had
in
a
vehement
oration
touched
to
the
quick
the
woeful
state
of
his
own
time
these
so
many
errors
saith
he
require
and
look
for
antichrist
gerson
complaineth
that
in
his
days
all
the
substance
and
efficacy
of
sacred
divinity
was
brought
unto
a
glorious
contention
and
ostentation
of
wits
and
to
very
sophistry
the
friars
of
lyons
men
as
touching
the
manner
of
their
life
not
to
be
misliked
were
wont
boldly
to
affirm
that
the
romish
church
from
whence
alone
all
counsel
and
order
was
then
sought
was
the
very
same
harlot
of
babylon
and
rout
of
devils
whereof
is
prophesied
so
plainly
in
the
apocalypse
i
know
well
enough
the
authority
of
these
foresaid
persons
is
but
lightly
regarded
among
these
men
how
then
if
i
call
forth
those
for
witness
whom
they
themselves
have
used
to
honour
what
if
i
say
that
adrian
the
bishop
of
rome
did
frankly
confess
that
all
these
mischiefs
brast
out
first
from
the
high
throne
of
the
pope
pighius
acknowledgeth
herein
to
be
a
fault
that
many
abuses
are
brought
in
even
into
the
very
mass
which
mass
otherwise
he
would
have
seem
to
be
a
reverend
matter
gerson
saith
that
through
the
number
of
most
fond
ceremonies
all
the
virtue
of
the
holy
ghost
which
ought
to
have
operation
in
us
and
all
true
godliness
is
utterly
quenched
and
dead
whole
greece
and
asia
complain
how
the
bishops
of
rome
with
the
marts
of
their
purgatories
and
pardons
have
both
tormented
men
consciences
and
picked
their
purses
as
touching
the
tyranny
of
the
bishops
of
rome
and
their
barbarous
pride
to
leave
out
others
whom
perchance
they
reckon
for
enemies
because
they
freely
and
liberally
find
fault
with
their
vices
the
same
men
which
have
led
their
life
at
rome
in
the
holy
city
in
the
face
of
the
most
holy
father
who
also
were
able
to
see
all
their
secrets
and
at
no
time
departed
from
the
catholic
faith
as
for
example
laurentius
valla
marsilius
patavinus
francis
petrarch
hierom
savonarola
abbot
joachim
baptist
of
mantua
and
before
all
these
bernard
the
abbot
have
many
a
time
and
much
complained
of
it
giving
the
world
also
sometime
to
understand
that
the
bishop
of
rome
himself
by
your
leave
is
very
antichrist
whether
they
spake
it
truly
or
falsely
let
that
go
sure
i
am
they
spake
it
plainly
neither
can
any
man
allege
that
those
authors
were
luther
or
zuinglius
scholars
for
they
were
not
only
certain
years
but
also
certain
ages
ere
ever
luther
or
zuinglius
names
were
heard
of
they
well
saw
that
even
in
their
days
errors
had
crept
into
the
church
and
wished
earnestly
they
might
be
amended
and
what
marvel
if
the
church
were
then
carried
away
with
errors
in
that
time
specially
when
neither
the
bishop
of
rome
who
then
only
ruled
the
roost
nor
almost
any
other
either
did
his
duty
or
once
understood
what
was
his
duty
for
it
is
hard
to
be
believed
while
they
were
idle
and
fast
asleep
that
the
devil
also
all
that
while
either
fell
asleep
or
else
continually
lay
idle
for
how
they
were
occupied
in
the
meantime
and
with
what
faithfulness
they
took
care
of
god
house
though
we
hold
our
peace
yet
i
pray
you
let
them
hear
bernard
their
own
friend
the
bishops
saith
he
who
now
have
the
charge
of
god
church
are
not
teachers
but
deceivers
they
are
not
feeders
but
beguilers
they
are
not
prelates
but
pilates
these
words
spake
bernard
of
that
bishop
who
named
himself
the
highest
bishop
of
all
and
of
the
other
bishops
likewise
which
then
had
the
place
of
government
bernard
was
no
lutheran
bernard
was
no
heretic
he
had
not
forsaken
the
catholic
church
yet
nevertheless
he
did
not
let
to
call
the
bishops
that
then
were
deceivers
beguilers
and
pilates
now
when
the
people
was
openly
deceived
and
christian
men
eyes
were
craftily
bleared
and
when
pilate
sat
in
and
condemned
christ
and
christ
members
to
sword
and
fire
o
good
lord
in
what
case
was
christ
church
then
but
yet
tell
me
of
so
many
and
so
gross
errors
what
one
have
these
men
at
any
time
reformed
or
what
fault
have
they
once
acknowledged
and
confessed
but
forsomuch
as
these
men
avouch
the
universal
possession
of
the
catholic
church
to
be
their
own
and
call
us
heretics
because
we
agree
not
in
judgment
with
them
let
us
know
i
beseech
you
what
proper
mark
and
badge
hath
that
church
of
theirs
whereby
it
may
be
known
to
be
the
church
of
god
i
wiss
it
is
not
so
hard
a
matter
to
find
out
church
if
a
man
will
seek
it
earnestly
and
diligently
for
the
church
of
god
is
set
upon
a
high
and
glittering
place
in
the
top
of
a
hill
and
built
upon
the
foundation
of
the
apostles
and
prophets
there
saith
augustine
let
us
seek
the
church
there
let
us
try
our
matters
and
as
he
saith
again
in
another
place
the
church
must
be
showed
out
of
the
holy
and
canonical
scriptures
and
that
which
can
not
be
showed
out
of
them
is
not
the
church
yet
for
all
this
i
wot
not
how
whether
it
be
for
fear
or
for
conscience
or
despair
of
victory
these
men
alway
abhor
and
fly
the
word
of
god
even
as
the
thief
flieth
the
gallows
and
no
wonder
truly
for
like
as
men
say
the
cantharus
perisheth
and
dieth
as
soon
as
it
is
laid
in
balm
notwithstanding
balm
be
otherwise
a
most
ointment
even
so
these
men
well
see
their
own
matter
is
damned
and
destroyed
in
the
word
of
god
as
if
it
were
in
poison
therefore
the
holy
scriptures
which
our
saviour
jesus
christ
did
not
only
use
for
authority
in
all
his
speech
but
did
also
at
last
seal
up
the
same
with
his
own
blood
these
men
to
the
intent
they
might
with
less
business
drive
the
people
from
the
same
as
from
a
thing
dangerous
and
deadly
have
used
to
call
them
a
bare
letter
uncertain
unprofitable
dumb
killing
and
dead
which
seemeth
to
us
all
one
as
if
they
should
say
the
scriptures
are
to
no
purpose
or
as
good
as
none
hereunto
they
add
a
similitude
not
very
agreeable
how
the
scriptures
be
like
to
a
nose
of
wax
or
a
shipman
hose
how
they
may
be
fashioned
and
plied
all
manner
of
ways
and
serve
all
men
turns
woteth
not
the
bishop
of
rome
that
these
things
are
spoken
by
his
own
minions
or
understandeth
he
not
he
hath
such
champions
to
fight
for
him
let
him
hearken
then
how
holily
and
how
godly
one
hosius
writeth
of
this
matter
a
bishop
in
polonia
as
he
testifieth
of
himself
a
man
doubtless
well
spoken
and
not
unlearned
and
a
very
sharp
and
stout
maintainer
of
that
side
one
will
marvel
i
suppose
how
a
good
man
could
either
conceive
so
wickedly
or
write
so
despitefully
of
those
words
which
he
knew
proceeded
from
god
mouth
and
specially
in
such
sort
as
he
would
not
have
it
seem
his
own
private
opinion
alone
but
the
common
opinion
of
all
that
band
he
dissembleth
i
grant
you
indeed
and
hideth
what
he
is
and
setteth
forth
the
matter
so
as
though
it
were
not
he
and
his
side
but
the
zuenckfeldian
heretics
that
so
did
speak
we
saith
he
will
bid
away
with
the
same
scriptures
whereof
we
see
brought
not
only
divers
but
also
contrary
interpretations
and
we
will
hear
god
speak
rather
than
we
will
resort
to
the
naked
elements
and
appoint
our
salvation
to
rest
in
them
it
behoveth
not
a
man
to
be
expert
in
the
law
and
scripture
but
to
be
taught
of
god
it
is
but
lost
labour
that
a
man
bestoweth
in
the
scriptures
for
the
scripture
is
a
creature
and
a
certain
bare
letter
this
is
hosius
saying
uttered
altogether
with
the
same
spirit
and
the
same
mind
wherewith
in
times
past
montane
and
marcion
were
moved
who
as
men
report
used
to
say
when
with
a
contempt
they
rejected
the
holy
scriptures
that
themselves
knew
many
more
and
better
things
than
either
christ
or
the
apostles
ever
knew
what
then
shall
i
say
here
o
ye
principal
posts
of
religion
o
ye
governors
of
christ
church
is
this
that
your
reverence
which
ye
give
to
god
word
the
holy
scriptures
which
paul
saith
came
by
the
inspiration
of
god
which
god
did
commend
by
so
many
miracles
wherein
are
the
most
perfect
prints
of
christ
own
steps
which
all
the
holy
fathers
apostles
and
angels
which
christ
himself
the
son
of
god
as
often
as
was
needful
did
allege
for
testimony
and
proof
will
ye
as
though
they
were
unworthy
for
you
to
hear
bid
them
avaunt
away
that
is
will
ye
enjoin
god
to
keep
silence
who
speaketh
to
you
most
clearly
by
his
own
mouth
in
the
scriptures
or
that
word
whereby
alone
as
paul
saith
we
are
reconciled
to
god
and
which
the
prophet
david
saith
is
holy
and
pure
and
shall
last
for
ever
will
ye
call
that
but
a
bare
and
dead
letter
or
will
ye
say
that
all
our
labour
is
lost
which
is
bestowed
in
that
thing
which
christ
hath
commanded
us
diligently
to
search
and
to
have
evermore
before
our
eyes
and
will
ye
say
that
christ
and
the
apostles
meant
with
subtlety
to
deceive
the
people
when
they
exhorted
them
to
read
the
holy
scriptures
that
thereby
they
might
flow
in
all
wisdom
and
knowledge
no
marvel
at
all
though
these
men
despise
us
and
all
our
doings
which
set
so
little
by
god
himself
and
his
infallible
sayings
yet
was
it
but
want
of
wit
in
them
to
the
intend
they
might
hurt
us
to
do
so
extreme
injury
to
the
word
of
god
but
hosius
will
here
make
exclamation
saying
we
do
him
wrong
and
that
these
be
not
his
own
words
but
the
words
of
the
heretic
zuenckfeldius
but
how
then
if
zuenckfeldius
make
exclamation
on
the
other
side
and
say
that
the
same
very
words
be
not
his
but
hosius
own
words
for
tell
me
where
hath
zuenckfeldius
ever
written
them
or
if
he
have
written
them
and
hosius
have
judged
the
same
to
be
wicked
why
hath
not
hosius
spoken
so
much
as
one
word
to
confute
them
howsoever
the
matter
goeth
although
hosius
peradventure
will
not
allow
of
those
words
yet
he
doth
not
disallow
the
meaning
of
the
words
for
well
near
in
all
controversies
and
namely
touching
the
use
of
the
holy
communion
under
both
kinds
although
the
words
of
christ
be
plain
and
evident
yet
doth
hosius
disdainfully
reject
them
as
no
better
than
cold
and
dead
elements
and
commandeth
us
to
give
faith
to
certain
new
lessons
appointed
by
the
church
and
to
i
wot
not
what
revelations
of
the
holy
ghost
and
pighius
saith
men
ought
not
to
believe
no
not
the
most
clear
and
manifest
words
of
the
scriptures
unless
the
same
be
allowed
for
good
by
the
interpretation
and
authority
of
the
church
and
yet
as
though
this
were
too
little
they
also
burn
the
holy
scriptures
as
in
times
past
wicked
king
aza
did
or
as
antiochus
or
maximinus
did
and
are
wont
to
name
them
heretics
books
and
out
of
doubt
to
see
too
they
would
fain
do
as
herod
in
old
time
did
in
jewry
that
he
might
with
more
surety
keep
still
his
dominion
who
being
an
idumaean
born
and
a
stranger
to
the
stock
and
kindred
of
the
jews
and
yet
coveting
much
to
be
taken
for
a
jew
to
the
end
he
might
establish
to
him
and
his
posterity
the
kingdom
of
that
country
which
he
had
gotten
of
augustus
caesar
he
commanded
all
the
genealogies
and
pedigrees
to
be
burnt
and
made
out
of
the
way
so
that
there
should
remain
no
record
whereby
he
might
be
known
to
them
that
came
after
that
he
was
an
alien
in
blood
whereas
even
from
abraham
time
these
monuments
had
been
safely
kept
amongst
the
jews
and
laid
up
in
their
treasury
because
in
them
it
might
easily
and
most
assuredly
be
found
of
what
lineage
everyone
did
descend
so
in
good
faith
do
these
men
when
they
would
have
all
their
own
doings
in
estimation
as
though
they
had
been
delivered
to
us
even
from
the
apostles
or
from
christ
himself
to
the
end
there
might
be
found
nowhere
anything
able
to
convince
such
their
dreams
and
lies
either
they
burn
the
holy
scriptures
or
else
they
craftily
convey
them
from
the
people
surely
very
rightly
and
aptly
doth
chrysostom
write
against
these
men
heretics
saith
he
shut
up
the
doors
against
the
truth
for
they
know
full
well
if
the
door
were
open
the
church
should
be
none
of
theirs
theophylact
also
god
word
saith
he
is
the
candle
whereby
the
thief
is
espied
and
tertullian
saith
the
holy
scripture
manifestly
findeth
out
the
fraud
and
theft
of
heretics
for
why
do
they
hide
why
do
they
keep
under
the
gospel
which
christ
would
have
preached
aloud
from
the
housetop
why
whelm
they
that
light
under
a
bushel
which
ought
to
stand
on
a
candlestick
why
trust
they
more
to
the
blindness
of
the
unskilful
multitude
and
to
ignorance
than
to
the
goodness
of
their
cause
think
they
their
sleights
are
not
already
perceived
and
that
they
can
walk
now
unespied
as
though
they
had
gyges
ring
to
go
invisibly
by
upon
their
finger
no
no
all
men
see
now
well
and
well
again
what
good
stuff
is
in
that
chest
of
the
bishop
of
rome
bosom
this
thing
alone
of
itself
may
be
an
argument
sufficient
that
they
work
not
uprightly
and
truly
worthily
ought
that
matter
seem
suspicious
which
flieth
trial
and
is
afraid
of
the
light
for
he
that
doeth
evil
as
christ
saith
seeketh
darkness
and
hateth
the
light
a
conscience
that
knoweth
itself
clear
cometh
willingly
into
open
show
that
the
works
which
proceed
of
god
may
be
seen
neither
be
they
so
very
blind
but
they
see
this
well
enough
that
their
own
kingdom
straightway
is
at
a
point
if
the
scriptures
once
have
the
upper
hand
and
that
like
as
men
say
the
idols
of
devils
in
times
past
of
whom
men
in
doubtful
matters
were
then
wont
to
receive
answers
were
suddenly
stricken
dumb
at
the
sight
of
christ
when
he
was
born
and
came
into
the
world
even
so
they
see
that
now
all
their
subtle
practices
will
soon
fall
down
headlong
upon
the
sight
of
the
gospel
for
antichrist
is
not
overthrown
but
by
the
brightness
of
christ
coming
as
for
us
we
run
not
for
succour
to
the
fire
as
these
men
guise
is
but
we
run
to
the
scriptures
neither
do
we
reason
with
the
sword
but
with
the
word
of
god
and
therewith
as
saith
tertullian
do
we
feed
our
faith
by
it
do
we
stir
up
our
hope
and
strengthen
our
confidence
for
we
know
that
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
is
the
power
of
god
unto
salvation
and
that
therein
consisteth
eternal
life
and
as
paul
warneth
us
we
do
not
hear
no
not
an
angel
of
god
coming
from
heaven
if
he
go
about
to
pull
us
from
any
part
of
this
doctrine
yea
more
than
this
as
the
holy
martyr
justin
speaketh
of
himself
we
would
give
no
credence
to
god
himself
if
he
should
teach
us
any
other
gospel
for
where
these
men
bid
the
holy
scriptures
away
as
dumb
and
fruitless
and
procure
us
to
come
to
god
himself
rather
who
speaketh
in
the
church
and
in
councils
which
is
to
say
to
believe
their
fancies
and
opinions
this
way
of
finding
out
the
truth
is
very
uncertain
and
exceeding
dangerous
and
in
manner
a
fantastical
and
mad
way
and
by
no
means
allowed
of
the
holy
fathers
chrysostom
saith
there
be
many
oftentimes
which
boast
themselves
of
the
holy
ghost
but
truly
whoso
speak
of
their
own
head
do
falsely
boast
they
have
the
spirit
of
god
for
like
as
saith
he
christ
denied
he
spake
of
himself
when
he
spake
out
of
the
law
and
prophets
even
so
now
if
anything
be
pressed
upon
us
in
the
name
of
the
holy
ghost
save
the
gospel
we
ought
not
to
believe
it
for
as
christ
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
and
prophets
so
is
the
holy
ghost
the
fulfilling
of
the
gospel
thus
far
goeth
chrysostom
part
but
here
i
look
they
will
say
though
they
have
not
the
scriptures
yet
may
chance
they
have
the
ancient
doctors
and
the
holy
fathers
with
them
for
this
is
a
high
brag
they
have
ever
made
how
that
all
antiquity
and
a
continual
consent
of
all
ages
doth
make
on
their
side
and
that
all
our
cases
be
but
new
and
yesterday
work
and
until
these
few
late
years
were
never
heard
of
questionless
there
can
nothing
be
more
spitefully
spoken
against
the
religion
of
god
than
to
accuse
it
of
novelty
as
a
new
come
up
matter
for
as
there
can
be
no
change
in
god
himself
so
ought
there
to
be
no
change
in
his
religion
yet
nevertheless
we
wot
not
by
what
means
but
we
have
ever
seen
it
come
so
to
pass
from
the
first
beginning
of
all
that
as
often
as
god
did
give
but
some
light
and
did
open
his
truth
unto
men
though
the
truth
were
not
only
of
greatest
antiquity
but
also
from
everlasting
yet
of
wicked
men
and
of
the
adversaries
was
it
called
and
of
late
devised
that
ungracious
and
bloodthirsty
haman
when
he
sought
to
procure
the
king
assuerus
displeasure
against
the
jews
this
was
his
accusation
to
him
thou
hast
here
saith
he
a
kind
of
people
that
useth
certain
new
laws
of
their
own
but
and
rebellious
against
all
thy
laws
when
paul
also
began
first
to
preach
and
expound
the
gospel
at
athens
he
was
called
a
of
new
gods
as
much
to
say
as
of
a
new
religion
for
said
the
athenians
may
we
not
know
of
thee
what
new
doctrine
this
is
celsus
likewise
when
he
of
set
purpose
wrote
against
christ
to
the
end
he
might
more
scornfully
scoff
out
the
gospel
by
the
name
of
novelty
what
saith
he
hath
god
after
so
many
ages
now
at
last
and
so
late
bethought
himself
eusebius
also
writeth
that
christian
religion
from
the
beginning
for
very
spite
was
called
greek
text
that
is
to
say
new
and
strange
after
like
sort
these
men
condemn
all
our
matters
as
strange
and
new
but
they
will
have
their
own
whatsoever
they
are
to
be
praised
as
things
of
long
continuance
doing
much
like
to
the
enchanters
and
sorcerers
which
working
with
devils
use
to
say
they
have
their
books
and
all
their
holy
and
hid
mysteries
from
athanasius
cyprian
moses
abel
adam
and
from
the
archangel
raphael
because
that
their
cunning
coming
from
such
patrons
and
founders
might
be
judged
the
more
high
and
holy
after
the
same
fashion
these
men
because
they
would
have
their
own
religion
which
they
themselves
and
that
not
long
since
have
brought
forth
into
the
world
to
be
the
more
easily
and
rather
accepted
of
foolish
persons
or
of
such
as
cast
little
whereabouts
they
or
other
do
go
they
are
wont
to
say
they
had
it
from
augustine
hierom
chrysostom
from
the
apostles
and
from
christ
himself
full
well
know
they
that
nothing
is
more
in
the
people
favour
or
better
liketh
the
common
sort
than
these
names
but
how
if
the
things
which
these
men
are
so
desirous
to
have
seem
new
be
found
of
greatest
antiquity
contrariwise
how
if
all
the
things
which
they
so
greatly
set
out
with
the
name
of
antiquity
having
been
well
and
thoroughly
examined
be
at
length
found
to
be
but
new
and
devised
of
very
late
soothly
to
say
no
man
that
hath
a
true
and
right
consideration
would
think
the
jews
laws
and
ceremonies
to
be
new
for
all
haman
accusation
for
they
were
graven
in
very
ancient
tables
of
most
antiquity
and
although
many
did
take
christ
to
have
swerved
from
abraham
and
the
old
fathers
and
to
have
brought
in
a
certain
new
religion
in
his
own
name
yet
answered
he
them
directly
if
ye
believed
moses
ye
would
believe
me
also
for
my
doctrine
is
not
so
new
as
you
make
it
for
moses
an
author
of
greatest
antiquity
and
one
to
whom
ye
give
all
honour
hath
spoken
of
me
paul
likewise
though
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
be
of
many
counted
to
be
but
new
yet
hath
it
saith
he
the
testimony
most
old
both
of
the
law
and
prophets
as
for
our
doctrine
which
we
may
rightly
call
christ
catholic
doctrine
it
is
so
far
off
from
new
that
god
who
is
above
all
most
ancient
and
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
hath
left
the
same
unto
us
in
the
gospel
in
the
prophets
and
apostles
works
being
monuments
of
greatest
age
so
that
no
man
can
now
think
our
doctrine
to
be
new
unless
the
same
think
either
the
prophets
faith
or
the
gospel
or
else
christ
himself
to
be
new
and
as
for
their
religion
if
it
be
of
so
long
continuance
as
they
would
have
men
ween
it
is
why
do
they
not
prove
it
so
by
the
examples
of
the
primitive
church
and
by
the
fathers
and
councils
of
old
times
why
lieth
so
ancient
a
cause
thus
long
in
the
dust
destitute
of
an
advocate
fire
and
sword
they
have
had
always
ready
at
hand
but
as
for
the
old
councils
and
the
fathers
all
mum
not
a
word
they
did
surely
against
all
reason
to
begin
first
with
these
so
bloody
and
extreme
means
if
they
could
have
found
other
more
easy
and
gentle
ways
and
if
they
trust
so
fully
to
antiquity
and
use
no
dissimulation
why
did
john
clement
a
countryman
of
ours
but
few
years
past
in
the
presence
of
certain
honest
men
and
of
good
credit
tear
and
cast
into
the
fire
certain
leaves
of
theodoret
the
most
ancient
father
and
a
greek
bishop
wherein
he
plainly
and
evidently
taught
that
the
nature
of
bread
in
the
communion
was
not
changed
abolished
or
brought
to
nothing
and
this
did
he
of
purpose
because
he
thought
there
was
no
other
copy
thereof
to
be
found
why
saith
albertus
pighius
that
the
ancient
father
augustine
had
a
wrong
opinion
of
original
sin
and
that
he
erred
and
lied
and
used
false
logic
as
touching
the
case
of
matrimony
concluded
after
a
vow
made
which
augustine
affirmeth
to
be
perfect
matrimony
indeed
and
can
not
be
undone
again
also
when
they
did
of
late
put
in
print
the
ancient
father
origen
work
upon
the
gospel
of
john
why
left
they
quite
out
the
whole
sixth
chapter
wherein
it
is
likely
yea
rather
of
very
surety
that
the
said
origen
had
written
many
things
concerning
the
sacrament
of
the
holy
communion
contrary
to
these
men
minds
and
would
put
forth
that
book
mangled
rather
than
full
and
perfect
for
fear
it
should
reprove
them
and
their
partners
of
their
error
call
ye
this
trusting
to
antiquity
when
ye
rent
in
pieces
keep
back
maim
and
burn
the
ancient
fathers
works
it
is
a
world
to
see
how
and
how
towardly
touching
religion
these
men
agree
with
the
fathers
of
whom
they
use
to
vaunt
that
they
be
their
own
good
the
old
council
eliberine
made
a
decree
that
nothing
that
is
honoured
of
the
people
should
be
painted
in
the
churches
the
old
father
epiphanius
saith
it
is
a
horrible
wickedness
and
a
sin
not
to
be
suffered
for
any
man
to
set
up
any
picture
in
the
church
of
the
christians
yea
though
it
were
the
picture
of
christ
himself
yet
these
men
store
all
their
temples
and
each
corner
of
them
with
painted
and
carved
images
as
though
without
them
religion
were
nothing
worth
the
old
fathers
origen
and
chrysostom
exhort
the
people
to
read
the
scriptures
to
buy
them
books
to
reason
at
home
betwixt
themselves
of
divine
matters
wives
with
their
husbands
and
parents
with
their
children
these
men
condemn
the
scriptures
as
dead
elements
and
as
much
as
ever
they
may
bar
the
people
from
them
the
ancient
fathers
cyprian
epiphanius
and
hierom
say
for
one
who
perchance
hath
made
a
vow
to
lead
a
sole
life
and
afterwards
liveth
unchastely
and
can
not
quench
the
flames
of
lust
it
is
better
to
marry
a
wife
and
to
live
honestly
in
wedlock
and
the
old
father
augustine
judgeth
the
selfsame
marriage
to
be
good
and
perfect
and
that
it
ought
not
to
be
broken
again
these
men
if
a
man
have
once
bound
himself
by
a
vow
though
afterwards
he
burn
keep
queans
and
defile
himself
with
never
so
sinful
and
desperate
a
life
yet
they
suffer
not
that
person
to
marry
a
wife
or
if
he
chance
to
marry
they
allow
it
not
for
marriage
and
they
commonly
teach
it
is
much
better
and
more
godly
to
keep
a
concubine
and
harlot
than
to
live
in
that
kind
of
marriage
the
old
father
augustine
complained
of
the
multitude
of
ceremonies
wherewith
he
even
then
saw
men
minds
and
consciences
overcharged
these
men
as
though
god
regarded
nothing
else
but
their
ceremonies
have
so
out
of
measure
increased
them
that
there
is
now
almost
none
other
thing
left
in
their
churches
and
places
of
prayer
again
that
old
father
augustine
denieth
it
to
be
lawful
for
a
monk
to
spend
his
time
slothfully
and
idly
and
under
a
pretended
and
counterfeit
holiness
to
live
all
upon
others
and
whoso
thus
liveth
the
old
father
apollonius
likeneth
him
to
a
thief
these
men
have
i
wot
not
whether
to
name
them
droves
or
herds
of
monks
who
for
all
they
do
nothing
nor
yet
once
intend
to
bear
any
show
of
holiness
yet
live
they
not
only
upon
others
but
also
riot
lavishly
of
other
folks
labours
the
old
council
of
rome
decreed
that
no
man
should
come
to
the
service
said
by
a
priest
well
known
to
keep
a
concubine
these
men
let
to
farm
concubines
to
their
priests
and
yet
constrain
men
by
force
against
their
will
to
hear
their
cursed
paltry
service
the
old
canons
of
the
apostles
command
that
bishop
to
be
removed
from
his
office
which
will
both
supply
the
place
of
a
civil
magistrate
and
also
of
an
ecclesiastical
person
these
men
for
all
that
both
do
and
will
needs
serve
both
places
nay
rather
the
one
office
which
they
ought
chiefly
to
execute
they
once
touch
not
and
yet
nobody
commandeth
them
to
be
displaced
the
old
council
gangrense
commandeth
that
none
should
make
such
difference
between
an
unmarried
priest
and
a
married
priest
as
he
ought
to
think
the
one
more
holy
than
the
other
for
single
life
sake
these
men
put
such
a
difference
between
them
that
they
straightway
think
all
their
holy
service
to
be
defiled
if
it
be
done
by
a
good
and
honest
man
that
hath
a
wife
the
ancient
emperor
justinian
commanded
that
in
the
holy
administration
all
things
should
be
pronounced
with
a
clear
loud
and
treatable
voice
that
the
people
might
receive
some
fruit
thereby
these
men
lest
the
people
should
understand
them
mumble
up
all
their
service
not
only
with
a
drowned
and
hollow
voice
but
also
in
a
strange
and
barbarous
tongue
the
old
council
at
carthage
commanded
that
nothing
should
be
read
in
christ
congregation
but
the
canonical
scriptures
these
men
read
such
things
in
their
churches
as
themselves
know
of
a
truth
to
be
stark
lies
and
fond
fables
but
if
there
be
any
that
think
these
authorities
be
but
weak
and
slender
because
they
were
decreed
by
emperors
and
certain
petit
bishops
and
not
by
so
full
and
perfect
councils
taking
pleasure
rather
in
the
authority
and
name
of
the
pope
let
such
a
one
know
that
pope
julius
doth
evidently
forbid
that
the
priest
in
ministering
the
communion
should
dip
the
bread
in
the
cup
these
men
contrary
to
pope
julius
decree
divide
the
bread
and
dip
it
in
the
wine
pope
clement
saith
it
is
not
lawful
for
a
bishop
to
deal
with
both
swords
for
if
thou
wilt
have
both
said
he
thou
shalt
deceive
both
thyself
and
those
that
obey
thee
nowadays
the
pope
challengeth
to
himself
both
swords
and
useth
both
wherefore
it
ought
to
seem
less
marvel
if
that
have
followed
which
clement
saith
that
is
that
he
hath
deceived
both
his
own
self
and
those
which
have
given
ear
unto
him
pope
leo
saith
upon
one
day
it
is
lawful
to
say
but
one
mass
in
one
church
these
men
say
daily
in
one
church
commonly
ten
masses
twenty
thirty
yea
oftentimes
more
so
that
the
poor
gazer
on
can
scant
tell
which
way
he
were
best
to
turn
him
pope
gelasius
saith
it
is
a
wicked
deed
and
sibb
to
sacrilege
in
any
man
to
divide
the
communion
and
when
he
hath
received
one
kind
to
abstain
from
the
other
these
men
contrary
to
god
word
and
contrary
to
pope
gelasius
command
that
one
kind
only
of
the
holy
communion
be
given
to
the
people
and
by
so
doing
they
make
their
priests
guilty
of
sacrilege
but
if
they
will
say
that
all
these
things
are
worn
out
of
ure
and
nigh
dead
and
pertain
nothing
to
these
present
times
yet
to
the
end
all
folk
may
understand
what
faith
is
to
be
given
to
these
men
and
upon
what
hope
they
call
together
their
general
councils
let
us
see
in
few
words
what
good
heed
they
take
to
the
selfsame
thing
which
they
themselves
these
very
last
years
and
the
remembrance
thereof
is
yet
new
and
fresh
in
their
own
general
council
that
they
had
by
order
called
have
decreed
and
commanded
to
be
devoutly
kept
in
the
last
council
at
trent
scant
fourteen
years
past
it
was
ordained
by
the
common
consent
of
all
degrees
that
one
man
should
not
have
two
benefices
at
one
time
what
is
become
now
of
that
ordinance
is
the
same
too
soon
worn
out
of
mind
and
clean
consumed
for
these
men
ye
see
give
to
one
man
not
two
benefices
only
but
sundry
abbeys
many
times
sometimes
also
two
bishoprics
sometimes
three
sometimes
four
and
that
not
only
to
an
unlearned
man
but
oftentimes
also
even
to
a
man
of
war
in
the
said
council
a
decree
was
made
that
all
bishops
should
preach
the
gospel
these
men
neither
preach
nor
once
go
up
into
the
pulpit
neither
think
they
it
any
part
of
their
office
what
great
pomp
and
crake
then
is
this
they
make
of
antiquity
why
brag
they
so
of
the
names
of
the
ancient
fathers
and
of
the
new
and
old
councils
why
will
they
seem
to
trust
to
their
authority
whom
when
they
list
they
despise
at
their
pleasure
but
i
have
a
special
fancy
to
commune
a
word
or
two
rather
with
the
pope
good
holiness
and
to
say
these
things
to
his
own
face
tell
us
i
pray
you
good
holy
father
seeing
ye
do
crake
so
much
of
all
antiquity
and
boast
yourself
that
all
men
are
bound
to
you
alone
which
of
all
the
fathers
hath
at
any
time
called
you
by
the
name
of
the
highest
prelate
the
universal
bishop
or
the
head
of
the
church
which
of
them
ever
said
that
both
the
swords
were
committed
unto
you
which
of
them
ever
said
that
you
have
authority
and
right
to
call
councils
which
of
them
ever
said
the
whole
world
is
but
your
diocese
which
of
them
that
all
bishops
have
received
of
your
fulness
which
of
them
that
all
power
is
given
to
you
as
well
in
heaven
as
in
earth
which
of
them
that
neither
kings
nor
the
whole
clergy
nor
yet
all
the
people
together
are
able
to
be
judges
over
you
which
of
them
that
kings
and
emperors
by
christ
commandment
and
will
do
receive
authority
at
your
hands
which
of
them
with
so
precise
and
mathematical
limitation
hath
surveyed
and
determined
you
to
be
seventy
and
seven
times
greater
than
the
mightiest
kings
which
of
them
that
more
ample
authority
is
given
to
you
than
to
the
residue
of
the
patriarchs
which
of
them
that
you
are
the
lord
god
or
that
you
are
not
a
mere
natural
man
but
a
certain
substance
made
and
grown
together
of
god
and
man
which
of
them
that
you
are
the
only
headspring
of
all
laws
which
of
them
that
you
have
power
over
purgatories
which
of
them
that
you
are
able
to
command
the
angels
of
god
as
you
list
yourself
which
of
them
that
ever
said
that
you
are
lord
of
lords
and
the
king
of
kings
we
can
also
go
further
with
you
in
like
sort
what
one
amongst
the
whole
number
of
the
old
bishops
and
fathers
ever
taught
you
either
to
say
private
mass
while
the
people
stared
on
or
to
lift
up
the
sacrament
over
your
head
in
which
point
consisteth
now
all
your
religion
or
else
to
mangle
christ
sacraments
and
to
bereave
the
people
of
the
one
part
contrary
to
christ
institution
and
plain
express
words
but
that
we
may
once
come
to
an
end
what
one
is
there
of
all
the
fathers
which
hath
taught
you
to
distribute
christ
blood
and
the
holy
martyrs
merits
and
to
sell
openly
as
merchandises
your
pardons
and
all
the
rooms
and
lodgings
of
purgatory
these
men
are
wont
to
speak
much
of
a
certain
secret
doctrine
of
theirs
and
of
their
manifold
and
sundry
readings
then
let
them
bring
forth
somewhat
now
if
they
can
that
it
may
appear
they
have
at
least
read
or
do
know
somewhat
they
have
often
stoutly
noised
in
all
corners
where
they
went
how
all
the
parts
of
their
religion
be
very
old
and
have
been
approved
not
only
of
the
multitude
but
also
by
the
consent
and
continual
observation
of
all
nations
and
times
let
them
therefore
once
in
their
life
show
this
their
antiquity
let
them
make
appear
at
eye
that
the
things
whereof
they
make
such
ado
have
taken
so
long
and
large
increase
let
them
declare
that
all
christian
nations
have
agreed
by
consent
to
this
their
religion
nay
nay
they
turn
their
backs
as
we
have
said
already
and
flee
from
their
own
decrees
and
have
cut
off
and
abolished
again
within
a
short
space
the
same
things
which
but
a
few
years
before
themselves
had
established
for
evermore
forsooth
to
continue
how
should
one
then
trust
them
in
the
fathers
in
the
old
councils
and
in
the
words
spoken
by
god
they
have
not
good
lord
they
have
not
i
say
those
things
which
they
boast
they
have
they
have
not
that
antiquity
they
have
not
that
universality
they
have
not
that
consent
of
all
places
nor
of
all
times
and
though
they
have
a
desire
rather
to
dissemble
yet
they
themselves
are
not
ignorant
hereof
yea
and
sometime
also
they
let
not
to
confess
it
openly
and
for
this
cause
they
say
that
the
ordinances
of
the
old
councils
and
fathers
be
such
as
may
now
and
then
be
altered
and
that
sundry
and
divers
decrees
serve
for
sundry
and
divers
times
of
the
church
thus
lurk
they
under
the
name
of
the
church
and
beguile
silly
creatures
with
their
vain
glozing
it
is
to
be
marvelled
that
either
men
be
so
blind
that
they
can
not
see
this
or
if
they
see
it
to
be
so
patient
as
they
can
lightly
and
quietly
bear
it
but
whereas
they
have
commanded
that
those
decrees
should
be
void
as
things
now
waxen
too
old
and
that
have
lost
their
grace
perhaps
they
have
provided
in
their
stead
certain
other
better
things
and
more
profitable
for
the
people
for
it
is
a
common
saying
with
them
that
if
christ
himself
or
the
apostles
were
alive
again
they
could
not
better
nor
godlier
govern
god
church
than
it
is
at
this
present
governed
by
them
they
have
put
in
their
stead
indeed
but
it
is
chaff
instead
of
wheat
as
hieremy
saith
and
such
things
as
according
to
esay
words
god
never
required
at
their
hands
they
have
stopped
up
saith
he
all
the
veins
of
clear
springing
water
and
have
digged
up
for
the
people
deceivable
and
pits
full
of
mire
and
filth
which
neither
have
nor
are
able
to
hold
pure
water
they
have
plucked
away
from
the
people
the
holy
communion
the
word
of
god
from
whence
all
comfort
should
be
taken
the
true
worshipping
of
god
also
and
the
right
use
of
sacraments
and
prayer
and
have
given
us
of
their
own
to
play
withal
in
the
meanwhile
salt
water
oil
boxes
spittle
palms
bulls
jubilees
pardons
crosses
censings
and
an
endless
rabble
of
ceremonies
and
as
a
man
might
term
with
plautus
pretty
games
to
make
sport
withal
in
these
things
have
they
set
all
their
religion
teaching
the
people
that
by
these
god
may
be
duly
pacified
spirits
be
driven
away
and
men
consciences
well
quieted
for
these
lo
be
the
orient
colours
and
precious
savours
of
christian
religion
these
things
doth
god
look
upon
and
accepteth
them
thankfully
these
must
come
in
place
to
be
honoured
and
put
quite
away
the
institutions
of
christ
and
of
his
apostles
and
like
as
in
times
past
when
wicked
king
jeroboam
had
taken
from
the
people
the
right
serving
of
god
and
brought
them
to
worship
the
golden
calves
lest
perchance
they
might
afterward
change
their
mind
and
slip
away
getting
them
again
to
jerusalem
to
the
temple
of
god
there
he
exhorted
them
with
a
long
tale
to
be
steadfast
saying
thus
unto
them
o
israel
these
calves
be
thy
gods
in
this
sort
commanded
your
god
you
should
worship
him
for
it
should
be
wearisome
and
troublous
for
you
to
take
upon
you
a
journey
so
far
off
and
yearly
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
there
to
serve
and
honour
your
god
even
after
the
same
sort
every
whit
when
these
men
had
once
made
the
law
of
god
of
effect
through
their
own
traditions
fearing
that
the
people
should
afterward
open
their
eyes
and
fall
another
way
and
should
somewhence
else
seek
a
surer
mean
of
their
salvation
jesu
how
often
have
they
cried
out
this
is
the
same
worshipping
that
pleaseth
god
and
which
he
straitly
requireth
of
us
and
wherewith
he
will
be
turned
from
his
wrath
that
by
these
things
is
conserved
the
unity
of
the
church
by
these
all
sins
be
cleansed
and
consciences
quieted
and
that
whoso
departeth
from
these
hath
left
unto
himself
no
hope
of
everlasting
salvation
for
it
were
wearisome
and
troublous
say
they
for
the
people
to
resort
to
christ
to
the
apostles
and
to
the
ancient
fathers
and
to
observe
continually
what
their
will
and
commandment
should
be
this
ye
may
see
is
to
withdraw
the
people
of
god
from
the
weak
elements
of
the
world
from
the
leaven
of
the
scribes
and
pharisees
and
from
the
traditions
of
men
it
were
reason
no
doubt
that
christ
commandments
and
the
apostles
were
removed
that
these
their
devices
might
come
in
place
o
just
cause
i
promise
you
why
that
ancient
and
so
long
allowed
doctrine
should
be
now
abolished
and
a
new
form
of
religion
be
brought
into
the
church
of
god
and
yet
whatever
it
be
these
men
cry
still
that
nothing
ought
to
be
changed
that
men
minds
are
well
satisfied
herewithal
that
the
church
of
rome
the
church
which
can
not
err
hath
decreed
these
things
for
silvester
prierias
saith
that
the
romish
church
is
the
squire
and
rule
of
truth
and
that
the
holy
scripture
hath
received
from
thence
authority
and
credit
the
doctrine
saith
he
of
the
romish
church
is
the
rule
of
most
infallible
faith
from
the
which
the
holy
scripture
taketh
his
force
and
indulgences
and
pardons
saith
he
are
not
made
known
to
us
by
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
but
they
are
made
known
to
us
by
the
authority
of
the
romish
church
and
of
the
bishops
of
rome
which
is
greater
pighius
also
letteth
not
to
say
that
without
the
license
of
the
romish
church
we
ought
not
to
believe
the
very
plain
scriptures
much
like
as
if
any
of
those
that
can
not
speak
pure
and
clean
latin
and
yet
can
babble
out
quickly
and
readily
a
little
some
such
law
latin
as
serveth
the
court
would
needs
hold
that
all
others
ought
also
to
speak
after
the
same
way
which
mammetrectus
and
catholicon
spake
many
years
ago
and
which
themselves
do
yet
use
in
pleading
in
court
for
so
may
it
be
understood
sufficiently
what
is
said
and
men
desires
be
satisfied
and
that
it
is
a
fondness
now
in
the
latter
end
to
trouble
the
world
with
a
new
kind
of
speaking
and
to
call
again
the
old
finesse
and
eloquence
that
cicero
and
caesar
used
in
their
days
in
the
latin
tongue
so
much
are
these
men
beholden
to
the
folly
and
darkness
of
the
former
times
many
things
as
one
writeth
are
had
in
estimation
oftentimes
because
they
have
been
once
dedicate
to
the
temples
of
the
heathen
gods
even
so
we
see
at
this
day
many
things
allowed
and
highly
set
by
of
these
men
not
because
they
judge
them
so
much
worth
but
only
because
they
have
been
received
into
a
custom
and
after
a
sort
dedicate
to
the
temple
of
god
our
church
say
they
can
not
err
they
speak
that
i
think
as
the
lacedaemonians
long
since
used
to
say
that
it
was
not
possible
to
find
any
adulterer
in
all
their
commonwealth
whereas
indeed
they
were
rather
all
adulterers
and
had
no
certainty
in
their
marriages
but
had
their
wives
common
amongst
them
all
or
as
the
canonists
at
this
day
for
their
bellies
sake
used
to
say
of
the
pope
that
forsomuch
as
he
is
lord
of
all
benefices
though
he
sell
for
money
bishoprics
monasteries
priesthood
spiritual
promotions
and
part
with
nothing
freely
yet
because
he
counteth
all
his
own
he
can
not
commit
simony
though
he
would
never
so
fain
but
how
strongly
and
agreeably
to
reason
these
things
be
spoken
we
are
not
as
yet
able
to
perceive
except
perchance
these
men
have
plucked
off
the
wings
from
the
truth
as
the
romans
in
old
time
did
prune
and
pinion
their
goddess
victoria
after
they
had
once
gotten
her
home
to
the
end
that
with
the
same
wings
she
should
never
more
be
able
to
flee
away
from
them
again
but
what
if
jeremy
tell
them
as
is
afore
rehearsed
that
these
be
lies
what
if
the
same
prophet
say
in
another
place
that
the
selfsame
men
who
ought
to
be
keepers
of
the
vineyard
have
brought
to
nought
and
destroyed
the
lord
vineyard
how
if
christ
say
that
the
same
persons
who
chiefly
ought
to
have
care
over
the
temple
have
made
of
the
lord
temple
a
den
of
thieves
if
it
be
so
that
the
church
of
rome
can
not
err
it
must
needs
follow
that
the
good
luck
thereof
is
far
greater
than
all
these
men
policy
for
such
is
their
life
their
doctrine
and
their
diligence
that
for
all
them
the
church
may
not
only
err
but
also
utterly
be
spoiled
and
perish
no
doubt
if
that
church
may
err
which
hath
departed
from
god
words
from
christ
commandments
from
the
apostles
ordinances
from
the
primitive
church
examples
from
the
old
fathers
and
councils
orders
and
from
their
own
decrees
and
which
will
be
bound
within
the
compass
of
none
neither
old
nor
new
nor
their
own
nor
other
folks
nor
man
law
nor
god
law
then
it
is
out
of
all
question
that
the
romish
church
hath
not
only
had
power
to
err
but
also
that
it
hath
shamefully
and
most
wickedly
erred
in
very
deed
but
say
they
ye
have
been
of
our
fellowship
but
now
ye
are
become
forsakers
of
your
profession
and
have
departed
from
us
it
is
true
we
have
departed
from
them
and
for
so
doing
we
both
give
thanks
to
almighty
god
and
greatly
rejoice
on
our
own
behalf
but
yet
for
all
this
from
the
primitive
church
from
the
apostles
and
from
christ
we
have
not
departed
true
it
is
we
were
brought
up
with
these
men
in
darkness
and
in
the
lack
of
the
knowledge
of
god
as
moses
was
taught
up
in
the
learning
and
in
the
bosom
of
the
egyptians
we
have
been
of
your
company
saith
tertullian
i
confess
it
and
no
marvel
at
all
for
saith
he
men
be
made
and
not
born
christians
but
wherefore
i
pray
you
have
they
themselves
the
citizens
and
dwellers
of
rome
removed
and
come
down
from
those
seven
hills
whereupon
rome
sometime
stood
to
dwell
rather
in
the
plain
called
mars
field
they
will
say
peradventure
because
the
conduits
of
water
wherewithout
men
can
not
commodiously
live
have
now
failed
and
are
dried
up
in
those
hills
well
then
let
them
give
us
like
leave
in
seeking
the
water
of
eternal
life
that
they
give
themselves
in
seeking
the
water
of
the
well
for
the
water
verily
failed
amongst
them
the
elders
of
the
jews
saith
jeremy
sent
their
little
ones
to
the
waterings
and
they
finding
no
water
being
in
a
miserable
case
and
utterly
marred
for
thirst
brought
home
again
their
vessels
empty
the
needy
and
poor
folk
saith
esay
sought
about
for
water
but
nowhere
found
they
any
their
tongue
was
even
withered
for
thirst
even
so
these
men
have
broken
in
pieces
all
the
pipes
and
conduits
they
have
stopped
up
all
the
springs
and
choked
up
the
fountain
of
living
water
with
dirt
and
mire
and
as
caligula
many
years
past
locked
up
fast
all
the
storehouses
of
corn
in
rome
and
thereby
brought
a
general
dearth
and
famine
amongst
the
people
even
so
these
men
by
damming
up
all
the
fountains
of
god
word
have
brought
the
people
into
a
pitiful
thirst
they
have
brought
into
the
world
as
saith
the
prophet
amos
a
hunger
and
a
thirst
not
the
hunger
of
bread
nor
the
thirst
of
water
but
of
hearing
the
word
of
god
with
great
distress
went
they
scattering
about
seeking
some
spark
of
heavenly
life
to
refresh
their
consciences
withal
but
that
light
was
already
thoroughly
quenched
out
so
that
they
could
find
none
this
was
a
rueful
state
this
was
a
lamentable
form
of
god
church
it
was
a
misery
to
live
therein
without
the
gospel
without
light
and
without
all
comfort
wherefore
though
our
departing
were
a
trouble
to
them
yet
ought
they
to
consider
withal
how
just
cause
we
had
of
our
departure
for
if
they
will
say
it
is
in
nowise
lawful
for
one
to
leave
the
fellowship
wherein
he
hath
been
brought
up
they
may
as
well
in
our
names
and
upon
our
heads
condemn
both
the
prophets
the
apostles
and
christ
himself
for
why
complain
they
not
also
of
this
that
lot
went
quite
his
way
out
of
sodom
abraham
out
of
chaldea
the
israelites
out
of
egypt
christ
from
the
jews
and
paul
from
the
pharisees
for
except
it
be
possible
there
may
be
a
lawful
cause
of
departing
we
see
no
reason
why
lot
abraham
the
israelites
christ
and
paul
may
not
be
accused
of
sects
and
sedition
as
well
as
others
and
if
these
men
will
needs
condemn
us
for
heretics
because
we
do
not
all
things
at
their
commandment
whom
in
god
name
or
what
kind
of
men
ought
they
themselves
to
be
taken
for
which
despise
the
commandment
of
christ
and
of
the
apostles
if
we
be
schismatics
because
we
have
left
them
by
what
name
then
shall
they
be
called
themselves
which
have
forsaken
the
greeks
from
whom
they
first
received
their
faith
forsaken
the
primitive
church
forsaken
christ
himself
and
the
apostles
even
as
if
children
should
forsake
their
parents
for
though
those
greeks
who
at
this
day
profess
religion
and
christ
name
have
many
things
corrupted
amongst
them
yet
hold
they
still
a
great
number
of
those
things
which
they
received
from
the
apostles
they
have
neither
private
masses
nor
mangled
sacraments
nor
purgatories
nor
pardons
and
as
for
the
titles
of
high
bishops
and
those
glorious
names
they
esteem
them
so
as
whosoever
he
were
that
would
take
upon
him
the
same
and
would
be
called
either
universal
bishop
or
the
head
of
the
universal
church
they
make
no
doubt
to
call
such
a
one
both
a
passing
proud
man
a
man
that
worketh
despite
against
all
the
other
bishops
his
brethren
and
a
plain
heretic
now
then
since
it
is
manifest
and
out
of
all
peradventure
that
these
men
have
fallen
from
the
greeks
of
whom
they
received
the
gospel
of
whom
they
received
the
faith
the
true
religion
and
the
church
what
is
the
matter
why
they
will
not
now
be
called
home
again
to
the
same
men
as
it
were
to
their
originals
and
first
founders
and
why
be
they
afraid
to
take
a
pattern
of
the
apostles
and
old
fathers
times
as
though
they
all
had
been
void
of
understanding
do
these
men
ween
ye
see
more
or
set
more
by
the
church
of
god
than
they
did
who
first
delivered
us
these
things
we
truly
have
renounced
that
church
wherein
we
could
neither
have
the
word
of
god
sincerely
taught
nor
the
sacraments
rightly
administered
nor
the
name
of
god
duly
called
upon
which
church
also
themselves
confess
to
be
faulty
in
many
points
and
wherein
was
nothing
able
to
stay
any
wise
man
or
one
that
hath
consideration
of
his
own
safety
to
conclude
we
have
forsaken
the
church
as
it
is
now
not
as
it
was
in
old
times
past
and
have
so
gone
from
it
as
daniel
went
out
of
the
den
and
the
three
children
out
of
the
furnace
and
to
say
the
truth
we
have
been
cast
out
by
these
men
being
cursed
of
them
as
they
used
to
say
with
book
bell
and
candle
rather
than
have
gone
away
from
them
of
ourselves
and
we
are
come
to
that
church
wherein
they
themselves
can
not
deny
if
they
will
say
truly
and
as
they
think
in
their
own
conscience
but
all
things
be
governed
purely
and
reverently
and
as
much
as
we
possibly
could
very
near
to
the
order
used
in
the
old
times
let
them
compare
our
churches
and
theirs
together
and
they
shall
see
that
themselves
have
most
shamefully
gone
from
the
apostles
and
we
most
justly
have
gone
from
them
for
we
following
the
example
of
christ
of
the
apostles
and
the
holy
fathers
give
the
people
the
holy
communion
whole
and
perfect
but
these
men
contrary
to
all
the
fathers
to
all
the
apostles
and
contrary
to
christ
himself
do
sever
the
sacraments
and
pluck
away
the
one
part
from
the
people
and
that
with
most
notorious
sacrilege
as
gelasius
termeth
it
we
have
brought
again
the
lord
supper
unto
christ
institution
and
have
made
it
to
be
a
communion
in
very
deed
common
and
indifferent
to
a
great
number
according
to
the
name
but
these
men
have
changed
all
things
contrary
to
christ
institution
and
have
made
a
private
mass
of
the
holy
communion
and
so
it
cometh
to
pass
that
we
give
the
supper
unto
the
people
and
they
give
them
a
vain
pageant
to
gaze
upon
we
affirm
together
with
the
ancient
fathers
that
the
body
of
christ
is
not
eaten
but
of
the
good
and
faithful
and
of
those
that
are
endued
with
the
spirit
of
christ
their
doctrine
is
that
christ
very
body
effectually
and
as
they
speak
really
and
substantially
may
not
only
be
eaten
of
the
wicked
and
unfaithful
men
but
also
which
is
monstrous
to
be
spoken
of
mice
and
dogs
we
use
to
pray
in
our
churches
after
that
fashion
as
according
to
paul
lesson
the
people
may
know
what
we
pray
and
may
answer
amen
with
a
general
consent
these
men
like
sounding
metal
yell
out
in
the
churches
unknown
and
strange
words
without
understanding
without
knowledge
and
without
devotion
yea
and
do
it
of
purpose
because
the
people
should
understand
nothing
at
all
but
not
to
tarry
about
rehearsing
all
points
wherein
we
and
they
differ
for
they
have
no
end
we
turn
the
scriptures
into
all
tongues
they
scant
suffer
them
to
be
had
abroad
in
any
tongue
we
allure
the
people
to
read
and
to
hear
god
word
they
drive
the
people
from
it
we
desire
to
have
our
cause
known
to
all
the
world
they
flee
to
come
to
any
trial
we
lean
unto
knowledge
they
unto
ignorance
we
trust
unto
light
they
unto
darkness
we
reverence
as
it
becometh
us
the
writings
of
the
apostles
and
prophets
and
they
burnt
them
finally
we
in
god
cause
desire
to
stand
to
god
only
judgment
they
will
stand
only
to
their
own
wherefore
if
they
will
weigh
all
these
things
with
a
quiet
mind
and
fully
bent
to
hear
and
to
learn
they
will
not
only
allow
this
determination
of
ours
who
have
forsaken
errors
and
followed
christ
and
his
apostles
but
themselves
also
will
forsake
their
own
selves
and
join
of
their
own
accord
to
our
side
part
vi
but
peradventure
they
will
say
it
was
treason
to
attempt
these
matters
without
a
sacred
general
council
for
in
that
consisteth
the
whole
force
of
the
church
there
christ
hath
promised
he
will
ever
be
a
present
assistant
yet
they
themselves
without
tarrying
for
any
general
council
have
broken
the
commandments
of
god
and
the
decrees
of
the
apostles
and
as
we
said
a
little
above
they
have
spoiled
and
disannulled
almost
all
not
only
ordinances
but
even
the
doctrine
of
the
primitive
church
and
where
they
say
it
is
not
lawful
to
make
a
change
without
a
council
what
was
he
that
gave
us
these
laws
or
from
whence
had
they
this
injunction
truly
king
agesilaus
did
but
fondly
who
when
he
had
a
determinate
answer
made
him
of
the
opinion
and
will
of
mighty
jupiter
would
afterward
bring
the
whole
matter
before
apollo
to
know
whether
he
would
allow
thereof
as
his
father
jupiter
did
or
no
but
yet
should
we
do
much
more
fondly
when
we
hear
god
himself
plainly
speak
to
us
in
his
most
holy
scriptures
and
may
understand
by
them
his
will
and
meaning
if
we
would
afterward
as
though
this
were
of
none
effect
bring
our
whole
cause
to
be
tried
by
a
council
which
were
nothing
else
but
to
ask
whether
men
would
allow
as
god
did
and
whether
men
would
confirm
commandment
by
their
authority
why
i
beseech
you
except
a
council
will
and
command
shall
not
truth
be
truth
and
god
be
god
if
christ
had
meant
to
do
so
from
the
beginning
as
that
he
would
preach
or
teach
nothing
without
the
bishop
consent
but
refer
all
his
doctrine
over
to
annas
and
caiaphas
where
should
now
have
been
the
christian
faith
or
who
at
any
time
should
have
heard
the
gospel
taught
peter
verily
whom
the
pope
hath
oftener
in
his
mouth
and
more
reverently
useth
to
speak
of
than
he
doth
of
jesus
christ
did
boldly
stand
against
the
holy
council
saying
it
is
better
to
obey
god
than
men
and
after
paul
had
once
entirely
embraced
the
gospel
and
had
received
it
not
from
men
nor
by
man
but
by
the
only
will
of
god
he
did
not
take
advice
therein
of
flesh
and
blood
nor
brought
the
case
before
his
kinsmen
and
brethren
but
went
forthwith
into
arabia
to
preach
god
divine
mysteries
by
god
only
authority
yet
truly
we
do
not
despise
councils
assemblies
and
conference
of
bishops
and
learned
men
neither
have
we
done
that
we
have
done
altogether
without
bishops
or
without
a
council
the
matter
hath
been
treated
in
open
parliament
with
long
consultation
and
before
a
notable
synod
and
convocation
but
touching
this
council
which
is
now
summoned
by
the
pope
pius
wherein
men
so
lightly
are
condemned
which
have
been
neither
called
heard
nor
seen
it
is
easy
to
guess
what
we
may
look
for
or
hope
of
it
in
times
past
when
nazianzen
saw
in
his
days
how
men
in
such
assemblies
were
so
blind
and
wilful
that
they
were
carried
with
affections
and
laboured
more
to
get
the
victory
than
the
truth
he
pronounced
openly
that
he
never
had
seen
any
good
end
of
any
council
what
would
he
say
now
if
he
were
alive
at
this
day
and
understood
the
heaving
and
shoving
of
these
men
for
at
that
time
though
the
matter
were
laboured
on
all
sides
yet
the
controversies
were
well
heard
and
open
error
was
put
clean
away
by
the
general
voice
of
all
parts
but
these
men
will
neither
have
the
case
to
be
freely
disputed
nor
yet
how
many
errors
soever
there
be
suffer
they
any
to
be
changed
for
it
is
a
common
custom
of
theirs
often
and
shamelessly
to
boast
that
their
church
can
not
err
that
in
it
there
is
no
fault
and
that
they
must
give
place
to
us
in
nothing
or
if
there
be
any
fault
yet
must
it
be
tried
by
bishops
and
abbots
only
because
they
be
the
directors
and
rulers
of
matters
and
they
be
the
church
of
god
aristotle
saith
that
a
city
can
not
consist
of
bastards
but
whether
the
church
of
god
may
consist
of
these
men
let
their
own
selves
consider
for
doubtless
neither
be
the
abbots
legitimate
abbots
nor
the
bishops
natural
right
bishops
but
grant
they
be
the
church
let
them
be
heard
speak
in
councils
let
them
alone
have
authority
to
give
assent
yet
in
old
time
when
the
church
of
god
if
ye
will
compare
it
with
their
church
was
very
well
governed
both
elders
and
deacons
as
saith
cyprian
and
certain
also
of
the
common
people
were
called
thereunto
and
made
acquainted
with
ecclesiastical
matters
but
i
put
case
these
abbots
and
bishops
have
no
knowledge
what
if
they
understand
nothing
what
religion
is
nor
how
we
ought
to
think
of
god
i
put
case
the
pronouncing
and
ministering
of
the
law
be
decayed
in
priests
and
good
counsel
fail
in
the
elders
and
as
the
prophet
micah
saith
the
night
be
unto
them
instead
of
a
vision
and
darkness
instead
of
prophesying
or
as
esaias
saith
what
if
all
the
watchmen
of
the
city
are
become
blind
what
if
the
salt
have
lost
his
proper
strength
and
savoriness
and
as
christ
saith
be
good
for
no
use
scant
worth
the
casting
on
the
dunghill
well
yet
then
they
will
bring
all
matters
before
the
pope
who
can
not
err
to
this
i
say
first
it
is
a
madness
to
think
that
the
holy
ghost
taketh
his
flight
from
a
general
council
to
run
to
rome
to
the
end
if
he
doubt
or
stick
in
any
matter
and
can
not
expound
it
of
himself
he
may
take
counsel
of
some
other
spirit
i
wot
not
what
that
is
better
learned
than
himself
for
if
this
be
true
what
needed
so
many
bishops
with
so
great
charges
and
so
far
journeys
have
assembled
their
convocation
at
this
present
at
trident
it
had
been
more
wisdom
and
better
at
least
it
had
been
a
much
nearer
way
and
handsomer
to
have
brought
all
things
rather
before
the
pope
and
to
have
come
straight
forth
and
have
asked
counsel
at
his
divine
breast
secondly
it
is
also
an
unlawful
dealing
to
toss
our
matter
from
so
many
bishops
and
abbots
and
to
bring
it
at
last
to
the
trial
of
one
only
man
specially
of
him
who
himself
is
appeached
by
us
of
heinous
and
foul
enormities
and
hath
not
yet
put
in
his
answer
who
hath
also
aforehand
condemned
us
without
judgment
by
order
pronounced
and
ere
ever
we
were
called
to
be
judged
how
say
ye
do
we
devise
these
tales
is
not
this
the
course
of
the
councils
in
these
days
are
not
all
things
removed
from
the
whole
holy
council
and
brought
before
the
pope
alone
that
as
though
nothing
had
been
done
to
purpose
by
the
judgments
and
consents
of
such
a
number
he
alone
may
add
alter
diminish
disannul
allow
remit
and
qualify
whatsoever
he
list
whose
words
be
these
then
and
why
have
the
bishops
and
abbots
in
the
last
council
of
trident
but
of
late
concluded
with
saying
thus
in
the
end
saving
always
the
authority
of
the
see
apostolic
in
all
things
or
why
doth
pope
paschal
write
so
proudly
of
himself
as
though
saith
he
there
were
any
general
council
able
to
prescribe
a
law
to
the
church
of
rome
whereas
all
councils
both
have
been
made
and
have
received
their
force
and
strength
by
the
church
of
rome
authority
and
in
ordinances
made
by
councils
is
ever
plainly
excepted
the
authority
of
the
bishop
of
rome
if
they
will
have
these
things
allowed
for
good
why
be
councils
called
but
if
they
command
them
to
be
void
why
are
they
left
in
their
books
as
things
allowable
but
be
it
so
let
the
bishop
of
rome
alone
be
above
all
councils
that
is
to
say
let
some
one
part
be
greater
than
the
whole
let
him
be
of
greater
power
let
him
be
of
more
wisdom
than
all
his
and
in
spite
of
hierom
head
let
the
authority
of
one
city
be
greater
than
the
authority
of
the
whole
world
how
then
if
the
pope
have
seen
none
of
these
things
and
have
never
read
either
the
scriptures
or
the
old
fathers
or
yet
his
own
councils
how
if
he
favour
the
arians
as
once
pope
liberius
did
or
have
a
wicked
and
a
detestable
opinion
of
the
life
to
come
and
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
as
pope
john
had
but
few
years
since
or
to
increase
his
own
dignity
do
corrupt
other
councils
as
pope
zosimus
corrupted
the
council
holden
at
nice
in
times
past
and
do
say
that
those
things
were
devised
and
appointed
by
the
holy
fathers
which
never
once
came
into
their
thought
and
to
have
the
full
sway
of
authority
do
wrest
the
scriptures
which
as
camotensis
saith
is
an
usual
custom
with
the
popes
how
if
he
have
renounced
the
faith
of
christ
and
become
an
apostate
as
lyranus
saith
many
popes
have
been
and
yet
for
all
this
shall
the
holy
ghost
with
turning
of
a
hand
knock
at
his
breast
and
even
whether
he
will
or
no
yea
and
wholly
against
his
will
kindle
him
a
light
so
as
he
may
not
err
shall
he
straightway
be
the
of
all
right
and
shall
all
treasure
of
wisdom
and
understanding
be
found
in
him
as
it
were
laid
up
in
store
or
if
these
things
be
not
in
him
can
he
give
a
right
and
apt
judgment
of
so
weighty
matters
or
if
he
be
not
able
to
judge
would
he
have
that
all
those
matters
should
be
brought
before
him
alone
what
will
ye
say
if
the
pope
advocates
abbots
and
bishops
dissemble
not
the
matter
but
show
themselves
open
enemies
to
the
gospel
and
though
they
see
yet
they
will
not
see
but
wry
the
scriptures
and
wittingly
and
knowingly
corrupt
and
counterfeit
the
word
of
god
and
foully
and
wickedly
apply
to
the
pope
all
the
same
things
which
evidently
and
properly
be
spoken
of
the
person
of
christ
only
nor
by
no
means
can
be
applied
to
any
other
and
what
though
they
say
the
pope
is
all
and
above
all
or
that
he
can
do
as
much
as
christ
can
and
that
one
and
one
serve
for
the
pope
and
for
christ
both
together
or
that
the
pope
is
the
same
light
which
should
come
into
the
world
which
words
christ
spake
of
himself
alone
and
that
whoso
is
an
hateth
and
flieth
from
that
light
or
that
all
the
other
bishops
have
received
of
the
pope
fulness
shortly
what
though
they
make
decrees
expressly
against
god
word
and
that
not
in
or
covertly
but
openly
and
in
the
face
of
the
world
must
it
needs
yet
be
gospel
straight
whatsoever
these
men
say
shall
these
be
god
holy
army
or
will
christ
be
at
hand
among
them
there
shall
the
holy
ghost
flow
in
their
tongues
or
can
they
with
truth
say
we
and
the
holy
ghost
have
thought
good
so
indeed
peter
asotus
and
his
companion
hosius
stick
not
to
affirm
that
the
same
council
wherein
our
saviour
jesus
christ
was
condemned
to
die
had
both
the
spirit
of
prophesying
and
the
holy
ghost
and
the
spirit
of
truth
in
it
and
that
it
was
neither
a
false
nor
a
trifling
saying
when
those
bishops
said
we
have
a
law
and
by
our
law
he
ought
to
die
and
that
they
so
saying
did
light
upon
the
very
truth
of
judgment
for
so
be
hosius
words
and
that
the
same
plainly
was
a
just
decree
whereby
they
pronounced
that
christ
was
worthy
to
die
this
methinketh
is
strange
that
these
men
are
not
able
to
speak
for
themselves
and
to
defend
their
own
cause
but
they
must
also
take
part
with
annas
and
caiaphas
for
if
they
will
call
that
a
lawful
and
a
good
council
wherein
the
son
of
god
was
most
shamefully
condemned
to
die
what
council
will
they
then
allow
for
false
and
naught
and
yet
as
all
their
councils
to
say
truth
commonly
be
necessity
compelled
them
to
pronounce
these
things
of
the
council
holden
by
annas
and
caiaphas
but
will
these
men
i
say
reform
us
the
church
being
themselves
both
the
persons
guilty
and
the
judges
too
will
they
abate
their
own
ambition
and
pride
will
they
overthrow
their
own
matter
and
give
sentence
against
themselves
that
they
must
leave
off
to
be
unlearned
bishops
slow
bellies
heapers
together
of
benefices
takers
upon
them
as
princes
and
men
of
war
will
the
abbots
the
pope
dear
darlings
judge
that
monk
for
a
thief
which
laboureth
not
for
his
living
and
that
it
is
against
all
law
to
suffer
such
a
one
to
live
and
to
be
found
either
in
city
or
in
country
or
yet
of
other
men
charges
or
else
that
a
monk
ought
to
lie
on
the
ground
to
live
hardly
with
herbs
and
pease
to
study
earnestly
to
argue
to
pray
to
work
with
hand
and
fully
to
bend
himself
to
come
to
the
ministry
of
the
church
in
faith
as
soon
will
the
pharisees
and
scribes
repair
again
the
temple
of
god
and
restore
it
unto
us
a
house
of
prayer
instead
of
a
thievish
den
there
have
been
i
know
certain
of
their
own
selves
which
have
found
fault
with
many
errors
in
the
church
as
pope
adrian
aeneas
sylvius
cardinal
pole
pighius
and
others
as
is
aforesaid
they
held
afterwards
their
council
at
trident
in
the
selfsame
place
where
it
is
now
appointed
there
assembled
many
bishops
and
abbots
and
others
whom
it
behoved
for
that
matter
they
were
alone
by
themselves
whatsoever
they
did
nobody
gainsaid
it
for
they
had
quite
shut
out
and
barred
our
side
from
all
manner
of
assemblies
and
there
they
sat
six
years
feeding
folks
with
a
marvellous
expectation
of
their
doings
the
first
six
months
as
though
it
were
greatly
needful
they
made
many
determinations
of
the
holy
trinity
of
the
father
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
which
were
godly
things
indeed
but
not
so
necessary
for
that
time
let
us
see
in
all
that
while
of
so
many
so
manifest
so
often
confessed
by
them
and
so
evident
errors
what
one
error
have
they
amended
from
what
kind
of
idolatry
have
they
reclaimed
the
people
what
superstition
have
they
taken
away
what
piece
of
their
tyranny
and
pomp
have
they
diminished
as
though
all
the
world
may
not
now
see
that
this
is
a
conspiracy
and
not
a
council
and
that
those
bishops
whom
the
pope
hath
now
called
together
be
wholly
sworn
and
become
bound
to
bear
him
their
faithful
allegiance
and
will
do
no
manner
of
thing
but
that
they
perceive
pleaseth
him
and
helpeth
to
advance
his
power
and
as
he
will
have
it
or
that
they
reckon
not
of
the
number
of
men
voices
rather
than
have
weight
and
consideration
of
the
same
or
that
might
doth
not
oftentimes
overcome
right
and
therefore
we
know
that
divers
times
many
good
men
and
catholic
bishops
did
tarry
at
home
and
would
not
come
when
such
councils
were
called
wherein
men
so
apparently
laboured
to
serve
factions
and
to
take
parts
because
they
knew
they
should
but
lose
their
travail
and
do
no
good
seeing
whereunto
their
enemies
minds
were
so
wholly
bent
athanasius
denied
to
come
when
he
was
called
by
the
emperor
to
his
council
at
caesarea
perceiving
plain
he
should
but
come
among
his
enemies
which
deadly
hated
him
the
same
athanasius
when
he
came
afterward
to
the
council
at
syrmium
and
foresaw
what
would
be
the
end
by
reason
of
the
outrage
and
malice
of
his
enemies
he
packed
up
his
carriage
and
went
away
immediately
john
chrysostom
although
the
emperor
constantius
commanded
him
by
four
sundry
letters
to
come
to
the
arians
council
yet
kept
he
himself
at
home
still
when
maximus
the
bishop
of
jerusalem
sat
in
the
council
at
palestine
the
old
father
paphnutius
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
out
at
the
doors
saying
it
is
not
lawful
for
us
to
confer
of
these
matters
with
wicked
men
the
bishops
of
the
east
would
not
come
to
the
syrmian
council
after
they
knew
athanasius
had
gotten
himself
thence
again
cyril
called
men
back
by
letters
from
the
council
of
them
which
were
named
patropassians
paulinus
bishop
of
triers
and
many
others
more
refused
to
come
to
the
council
at
milan
when
they
understood
what
a
stir
and
rule
auxentius
kept
there
for
they
saw
it
was
in
vain
to
go
thither
where
not
reason
but
faction
should
prevail
and
where
folk
contended
not
for
the
truth
and
right
judgment
of
the
matter
but
for
partiality
and
favour
and
yet
for
all
those
fathers
had
such
malicious
and
enemies
yet
if
they
had
come
they
should
have
had
free
speech
at
least
in
the
councils
but
now
sithence
none
of
us
may
be
suffered
so
much
as
to
sit
or
once
to
be
seen
in
these
men
meetings
much
less
suffered
to
speak
freely
our
mind
and
seeing
the
pope
legates
patriarchs
archbishops
bishops
and
abbots
all
being
conspired
together
all
linked
together
in
one
kind
of
fault
and
all
bound
by
one
oath
sit
alone
by
themselves
and
have
power
alone
to
give
their
consent
and
at
last
when
they
have
all
done
as
though
they
had
done
nothing
bring
all
their
opinions
to
be
judged
at
the
will
and
pleasure
of
the
pope
being
but
one
man
to
the
end
he
may
pronounce
his
own
sentence
of
himself
who
ought
rather
to
have
answered
to
his
complaint
sithence
also
the
same
ancient
and
christian
liberty
which
of
all
right
should
specially
be
in
christian
councils
is
now
utterly
taken
away
from
the
council
for
these
causes
i
say
wise
and
good
men
ought
not
to
marvel
at
this
day
though
we
do
the
like
now
that
they
see
was
done
in
times
past
in
like
case
of
so
many
fathers
and
catholic
bishops
which
is
though
we
choose
rather
to
sit
at
home
and
leave
our
whole
cause
to
god
than
to
journey
thither
whereas
we
neither
shall
have
place
nor
be
able
to
do
any
good
whereas
we
can
obtain
no
audience
whereas
princes
ambassadors
be
but
used
as
and
whereas
also
we
be
condemned
already
before
trial
as
though
the
matter
were
aforehand
despatched
and
agreed
upon
nevertheless
we
can
bear
patiently
and
quietly
our
own
private
wrongs
but
wherefore
do
they
shut
out
christian
kings
and
good
princes
from
their
convocation
why
do
they
so
uncourteously
or
with
such
spite
leave
them
out
and
as
though
they
were
not
either
christian
men
or
else
could
not
judge
will
not
have
them
made
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
christian
religion
nor
understand
the
state
of
their
own
churches
or
if
the
said
kings
and
princes
happen
to
intermeddle
in
such
matters
and
take
upon
them
to
do
that
they
may
do
that
they
be
commanded
to
do
and
ought
of
duty
to
do
and
the
same
things
that
we
know
both
david
and
solomon
and
other
good
princes
have
done
that
is
if
they
whilst
the
pope
and
his
prelates
slug
and
sleep
or
else
mischievously
withstand
them
do
bridle
the
priests
sensuality
and
drive
them
to
do
their
duty
and
keep
them
still
to
it
if
they
do
overthrow
idols
if
they
take
away
superstition
and
set
up
again
the
true
worshipping
of
god
why
do
they
make
an
outcry
upon
them
that
such
princes
trouble
all
and
press
by
violence
into
another
body
office
and
do
thereby
wickedly
and
malapertly
what
scripture
hath
at
any
time
forbidden
a
christian
prince
to
be
made
privy
to
such
causes
who
but
themselves
alone
made
ever
any
such
law
they
will
say
to
this
i
guess
civil
princes
have
learned
to
govern
a
commonwealth
and
to
order
matters
of
war
but
they
understand
not
the
secret
mysteries
of
religion
if
that
be
so
what
is
the
pope
i
pray
you
at
this
day
other
than
a
monarch
or
a
prince
or
what
be
the
cardinals
who
must
be
none
other
nowadays
but
princes
and
kings
sons
what
else
be
the
patriarchs
and
for
the
most
part
the
archbishops
the
bishops
the
abbots
what
be
they
else
at
this
present
in
the
kingdom
but
worldly
princes
but
dukes
and
earls
gorgeously
accompanied
with
bands
of
men
whithersoever
they
go
oftentimes
also
gaily
arrayed
with
chains
and
collars
of
gold
they
have
at
times
too
certain
ornaments
by
themselves
as
crosses
pillars
hats
mitres
and
palls
which
pomp
the
ancient
bishops
chrysostom
augustine
and
ambrose
never
had
setting
these
things
aside
what
teach
they
what
say
they
what
do
they
how
live
they
i
say
not
as
may
become
a
bishop
but
as
may
become
even
a
christian
man
is
it
so
great
a
matter
to
have
a
vain
title
and
by
changing
a
garment
only
to
have
the
name
of
a
bishop
surely
to
have
the
principal
stay
and
effect
of
all
matters
committed
wholly
to
these
men
hands
who
neither
know
nor
will
know
these
things
nor
yet
set
a
jot
by
any
point
of
religion
save
that
which
concerneth
their
belly
and
riot
and
to
have
them
alone
sit
as
judges
and
to
be
set
up
as
overseers
in
the
being
no
better
than
blind
spies
of
the
other
side
to
have
a
christian
prince
of
good
understanding
and
of
a
right
judgment
to
stand
still
like
a
block
or
a
stake
not
to
be
suffered
neither
to
give
his
voice
nor
to
show
his
judgment
but
only
to
wait
what
these
men
shall
will
and
command
as
one
which
had
neither
ears
nor
eyes
nor
wit
nor
heart
and
whatsoever
they
give
in
charge
to
allow
it
without
exception
blindly
fulfilling
their
commandments
be
they
never
so
blasphemous
and
wicked
yea
although
they
command
him
quite
to
destroy
all
religion
and
to
crucify
again
christ
himself
this
surely
besides
that
it
is
proud
and
spiteful
is
also
beyond
all
right
and
reason
and
not
to
be
endured
of
christian
and
wise
princes
why
i
pray
you
may
caiaphas
and
annas
understand
these
matters
and
may
not
david
and
ezechias
do
the
same
is
it
lawful
for
a
cardinal
being
a
man
of
war
and
delighting
in
blood
to
have
place
in
a
council
and
is
it
not
lawful
for
a
christian
emperor
or
a
king
we
truly
grant
no
further
liberty
to
our
magistrates
than
that
we
know
hath
both
been
given
them
by
the
word
of
god
and
also
been
confirmed
by
the
examples
of
the
very
best
governed
commonwealths
for
besides
that
a
christian
prince
hath
the
charge
of
both
tables
committed
to
him
by
god
to
the
end
he
may
understand
that
not
temporal
matters
only
but
also
religious
and
ecclesiastical
causes
pertain
to
his
office
besides
also
that
god
by
his
prophets
often
and
earnestly
commandeth
the
king
to
cut
down
the
groves
to
break
down
the
images
and
altars
of
idols
and
to
write
out
the
book
of
the
law
for
himself
and
besides
that
the
prophet
isaiah
saith
a
king
ought
to
be
a
patron
and
a
nurse
of
the
church
i
say
besides
all
these
things
we
see
by
histories
and
by
examples
of
the
best
times
that
good
princes
ever
took
the
administration
of
ecclesiastical
matters
to
pertain
to
their
duty
moses
a
civil
magistrate
and
chief
guide
of
the
people
both
received
from
god
and
delivered
to
the
people
all
the
order
for
religion
and
sacrifices
and
gave
aaron
the
bishop
a
vehement
and
sore
rebuke
for
making
the
golden
calf
and
for
suffering
the
corruption
of
religion
joshua
also
though
he
were
none
other
than
a
civil
magistrate
yet
as
soon
as
he
was
chosen
by
god
and
set
as
a
ruler
over
the
people
he
received
commandments
specially
touching
religion
and
the
service
of
god
king
david
when
the
whole
religion
was
altogether
brought
out
of
frame
by
wicked
king
saul
brought
home
again
the
ark
of
god
that
is
to
say
he
restored
religion
again
and
was
not
only
amongst
them
himself
as
a
counsellor
and
furtherer
of
the
work
but
he
appointed
also
hymns
and
psalms
put
in
order
the
companies
and
was
the
only
doer
in
setting
forth
that
whole
solemn
show
and
in
effect
ruled
the
priests
king
solomon
built
unto
the
lord
the
temple
which
his
father
david
had
but
purposed
in
his
mind
to
do
and
after
the
finishing
thereof
he
made
a
goodly
oration
to
the
people
concerning
religion
and
the
service
of
god
he
afterward
displaced
abiathar
the
priest
and
set
sadok
in
his
place
after
this
when
the
temple
of
god
was
in
shameful
wise
polluted
through
the
naughtiness
and
negligence
of
the
priests
king
hezekiah
commanded
the
same
to
be
cleansed
from
the
rubble
and
filth
the
priests
to
light
up
candles
to
burn
incense
and
to
do
their
divine
service
according
to
the
old
and
allowed
custom
the
same
king
also
commanded
the
brazen
serpent
which
then
the
people
wickedly
worshipped
to
be
taken
down
and
beaten
to
powder
king
jehoshaphat
overthrew
and
utterly
made
away
the
hill
altars
and
groves
whereby
he
saw
god
honour
hindered
and
the
people
holden
back
with
a
private
superstition
from
the
ordinary
temple
which
was
at
jerusalem
whereto
they
should
by
order
have
resorted
yearly
from
every
part
of
the
realm
king
josiah
with
great
diligence
put
the
priests
and
bishops
in
mind
of
their
duties
king
joash
bridled
the
riot
and
arrogancy
of
the
priests
jehu
put
to
death
the
wicked
prophets
and
to
rehearse
no
more
examples
out
of
the
old
law
let
us
rather
consider
since
the
birth
of
christ
how
the
church
hath
been
governed
in
the
gospel
time
the
christian
emperors
in
the
old
time
appointed
the
councils
of
the
bishops
constantine
called
the
council
at
nice
theodosius
the
first
called
the
council
at
constantinople
theodosius
the
second
the
council
at
ephesus
martian
the
council
at
chalcedon
and
when
ruffine
the
heretic
had
alleged
for
authority
a
council
which
as
he
thought
should
make
for
him
hierom
his
adversary
to
confute
him
tell
us
quod
he
what
emperor
commanded
that
council
to
be
called
the
same
hierom
again
in
his
epitaph
upon
paula
maketh
mention
of
the
emperor
letters
which
gave
commandment
to
call
the
bishops
of
italy
and
greece
to
rome
to
a
council
continually
for
the
space
of
five
hundred
years
the
emperor
alone
appointed
the
ecclesiastical
assemblies
and
called
the
councils
of
the
bishops
together
we
now
therefore
marvel
the
more
at
the
unreasonable
dealing
of
the
bishop
of
rome
who
knowing
what
was
the
emperor
right
when
the
church
was
well
ordered
knowing
also
that
it
is
now
a
common
right
to
all
princes
for
so
much
as
the
kings
are
now
fully
possessed
in
the
several
parts
of
the
whole
empire
doth
so
without
consideration
assign
that
office
alone
to
himself
and
taketh
it
sufficient
in
summoning
a
general
council
to
make
that
man
that
is
prince
of
the
whole
world
no
otherwise
partaker
thereof
than
he
would
make
his
own
servant
and
although
the
modesty
and
mildness
of
the
emperor
ferdinand
be
so
great
that
he
can
bear
this
wrong
because
peradventure
he
understandeth
not
well
the
pope
packing
yet
ought
not
the
pope
of
his
holiness
to
offer
him
that
wrong
nor
to
claim
as
his
own
another
man
right
but
hereto
some
will
reply
the
emperor
indeed
called
councils
at
that
time
ye
speak
of
because
the
bishop
of
rome
was
not
yet
grown
so
great
as
he
is
now
but
yet
the
emperor
did
not
then
sit
together
with
the
bishops
in
council
or
once
bare
any
stroke
with
his
authority
in
their
consultation
i
answer
nay
that
it
is
not
so
for
as
witnesseth
theodoret
the
emperor
constantine
sat
not
only
together
with
them
in
the
council
of
nice
but
gave
also
advice
to
the
bishops
how
it
was
best
to
try
out
the
matter
by
the
apostles
and
prophets
writings
as
appeareth
by
these
his
own
words
in
disputation
saith
he
of
matters
of
divinity
we
have
set
before
us
to
follow
the
doctrine
of
the
holy
ghost
for
the
evangelists
and
the
apostles
works
and
the
prophets
sayings
show
us
sufficiently
what
opinion
we
ought
to
have
of
the
will
of
god
the
emperor
theodosius
as
saith
socrates
did
not
only
sit
amongst
the
bishops
but
also
ordered
the
whole
arguing
of
the
cause
and
tare
in
pieces
the
heretics
books
and
allowed
for
good
the
judgment
of
the
catholics
in
the
council
at
chalcedon
a
civil
magistrate
condemned
for
heretics
by
the
sentence
of
his
own
mouth
the
bishops
dioscorus
juvenalis
and
thalassius
and
gave
judgment
to
put
them
down
from
their
dignities
in
the
church
in
the
third
council
at
constantinople
constantine
a
civil
magistrate
did
not
only
sit
amongst
the
bishops
but
did
also
subscribe
with
them
for
saith
he
we
have
both
read
and
subscribed
in
the
second
council
called
arausicanum
the
ambassadors
being
noble
men
born
not
only
spake
their
mind
touching
religion
but
set
to
their
hands
also
as
well
as
the
bishops
for
thus
it
is
written
in
the
latter
end
of
that
council
petrus
marcellinus
felix
and
liberius
being
most
noble
men
and
famous
lieutenants
and
captains
of
france
and
also
peers
of
the
realm
have
given
their
consent
and
set
to
their
hands
further
syagrius
opilio
pantagathus
deodatus
cariattho
and
marcellus
men
of
very
great
honour
have
subscribed
if
it
be
so
then
that
lieutenants
captains
and
peers
have
had
authority
to
subscribe
in
council
have
not
emperors
and
kings
the
like
authority
truly
there
had
been
no
need
to
handle
so
plain
a
matter
as
this
is
with
so
many
words
and
so
at
length
if
we
had
not
to
do
with
those
men
who
for
a
desire
they
have
to
strive
and
to
win
the
mastery
use
of
course
to
deny
all
things
be
they
never
so
clear
yea
the
very
same
which
they
presently
see
and
behold
with
their
own
eyes
the
emperor
justinian
made
a
law
to
correct
the
behaviour
of
the
clergy
and
to
cut
short
the
insolency
of
the
priests
and
albeit
he
were
a
christian
and
a
catholic
prince
yet
put
he
down
from
their
papal
throne
two
popes
sylverius
and
vigilius
notwithstanding
they
were
peter
successors
and
vicars
let
us
see
then
such
men
as
have
authority
over
the
bishops
such
men
as
receive
from
god
commandments
concerning
religion
such
as
bring
home
again
the
ark
of
god
make
holy
hymns
oversee
the
priests
build
the
temple
make
orations
touching
divine
service
cleanse
the
temples
destroy
the
hill
altars
burn
the
idols
groves
teach
the
priests
their
duties
write
them
out
precepts
how
they
should
live
kill
the
wicked
prophets
displace
the
high
priests
call
together
the
councils
of
bishops
sit
together
with
the
bishops
instructing
them
what
they
ought
to
do
condemn
and
punish
an
heretical
bishop
be
made
acquainted
with
matters
of
religion
which
subscribe
and
give
sentence
and
do
all
these
things
not
by
any
other
man
commission
but
in
their
own
name
and
that
both
uprightly
and
godly
shall
we
say
it
pertaineth
not
to
such
men
to
have
to
do
with
religion
or
shall
we
say
a
christian
magistrate
which
dealeth
amongst
others
in
these
matters
doth
either
naughtily
or
presumptuously
or
wickedly
the
most
ancient
and
christian
emperors
and
kings
that
ever
were
did
busy
themselves
with
these
matters
and
yet
were
they
never
for
this
cause
noted
either
of
wickedness
or
of
presumption
and
what
is
he
that
can
find
out
either
more
catholic
princes
or
more
notable
examples
wherefore
if
it
were
lawful
for
them
to
do
thus
being
but
civil
magistrates
and
having
the
chief
rule
of
commonweals
what
offence
have
our
princes
at
this
day
made
which
may
not
have
leave
to
do
the
like
being
in
the
like
degree
or
what
especial
gift
of
learning
or
of
judgment
or
of
holiness
have
these
men
now
that
contrary
to
the
custom
of
all
the
ancient
and
catholic
bishops
who
used
to
confer
with
princes
and
peers
concerning
religion
they
do
now
thus
reject
and
cast
off
christian
princes
from
knowing
of
the
cause
and
from
their
meetings
well
thus
doing
they
wisely
and
warily
provide
for
themselves
and
for
their
kingdom
which
otherwise
they
see
is
like
shortly
to
come
to
nought
for
if
so
be
they
whom
god
hath
placed
in
greatest
dignity
did
see
and
perceive
these
men
practices
how
christ
commandments
be
despised
by
them
how
the
light
of
the
gospel
is
darkened
and
quenched
out
by
them
and
how
themselves
also
be
subtly
beguiled
and
mocked
and
unawares
be
deluded
by
them
and
the
way
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
stopped
up
before
them
no
doubt
they
would
never
so
quietly
suffer
themselves
neither
to
be
disdained
after
such
a
proud
sort
nor
so
despitefully
to
be
scorned
and
abused
by
them
but
now
through
their
own
lack
of
understanding
and
through
their
own
blindness
these
men
have
them
fast
yoked
and
in
their
danger
we
truly
for
our
parts
as
we
have
said
have
done
nothing
in
altering
religion
either
upon
rashness
or
arrogancy
nor
nothing
but
with
good
leisure
and
great
consideration
neither
had
we
ever
intended
to
do
it
except
both
the
manifest
and
most
assured
will
of
god
opened
to
us
in
his
holy
scriptures
and
the
regard
of
our
own
salvation
had
even
constrained
us
thereunto
for
though
we
have
departed
from
that
church
which
these
men
call
catholic
and
by
that
means
get
us
envy
amongst
them
that
want
skill
to
judge
yet
is
this
enough
for
us
and
ought
to
be
enough
for
every
wise
and
good
man
and
one
that
maketh
account
of
everlasting
life
that
we
have
gone
from
that
church
which
had
power
to
err
which
christ
who
can
not
err
told
so
long
before
it
should
err
and
which
we
ourselves
did
evidently
see
with
our
eyes
to
have
gone
both
from
the
holy
fathers
and
from
the
apostles
and
from
christ
his
own
self
and
from
the
primitive
and
catholic
church
and
we
are
come
as
near
as
we
possibly
could
to
the
church
of
the
apostles
and
of
the
old
catholic
bishops
and
fathers
which
church
we
know
hath
hereunto
been
sound
and
perfect
and
as
tertullian
termeth
it
a
pure
virgin
spotted
as
yet
with
no
idolatry
nor
with
any
foul
or
shameful
fault
and
have
directed
according
to
their
customs
and
ordinances
not
only
our
doctrine
but
also
the
sacraments
and
the
form
of
common
prayer
and
as
we
know
both
christ
himself
and
all
good
men
heretofore
have
done
we
have
called
home
again
to
the
original
and
first
foundation
that
religion
which
hath
been
foully
foreslowed
and
utterly
corrupted
by
these
men
for
we
thought
it
meet
thence
to
take
the
pattern
of
reforming
religion
from
whence
the
ground
of
religion
was
first
taken
because
this
one
reason
as
saith
the
most
ancient
father
tertullian
hath
great
force
against
all
heresies
look
whatsoever
was
first
that
is
true
and
whatsoever
is
latter
that
is
corrupt
irenaeus
oftentimes
appealed
to
the
oldest
churches
which
had
been
nearest
to
christ
time
and
which
it
was
hard
to
believe
had
erred
but
why
at
this
day
is
not
the
same
respect
and
consideration
had
why
return
we
not
to
the
pattern
of
the
old
churches
why
may
not
we
hear
at
this
time
amongst
us
the
same
saying
which
was
openly
pronounced
in
times
past
in
the
council
at
nice
by
so
many
bishops
and
catholic
fathers
and
nobody
once
speaking
against
it
greek
text
that
is
to
say
hold
still
the
old
customs
when
esdras
went
about
to
repair
the
ruins
of
the
temple
of
god
he
sent
not
to
ephesus
although
the
most
beautiful
and
gorgeous
temple
of
diana
was
there
and
when
he
purposed
to
restore
the
sacrifices
and
ceremonies
of
god
he
sent
not
to
rome
although
peradventure
he
had
heard
in
that
place
were
the
solemn
sacrifices
called
hecatombae
and
other
called
solitaurilia
lectisternia
and
supplicationes
and
numa
ceremonial
books
he
thought
it
enough
for
him
to
set
before
his
eyes
and
follow
the
pattern
of
the
old
temple
which
solomon
at
the
beginning
builded
according
as
god
had
appointed
him
and
also
those
old
customs
and
ceremonies
which
god
himself
had
written
out
by
special
words
for
moses
the
prophet
aggaeus
after
the
temple
was
repaired
again
by
esdras
and
the
people
might
think
they
had
a
very
just
cause
to
rejoice
on
their
own
behalf
for
so
great
a
benefit
received
of
almighty
god
yet
made
he
them
all
burst
out
into
tears
because
that
they
which
were
yet
alive
and
had
seen
the
former
building
of
the
temple
before
the
babylonians
destroyed
it
called
to
mind
how
far
off
it
was
yet
from
that
beauty
and
excellency
which
it
had
in
the
old
times
past
before
for
then
indeed
would
they
have
thought
the
temple
worthily
repaired
if
it
had
answered
to
the
ancient
pattern
and
to
the
majesty
of
the
first
temple
paul
because
he
would
amend
the
abuse
of
the
lord
supper
which
the
corinthians
even
then
began
to
corrupt
he
set
before
them
christ
institution
to
follow
saying
i
have
delivered
unto
you
that
which
i
first
received
of
the
lord
and
when
christ
did
confute
the
error
of
the
pharisees
ye
must
saith
he
return
to
the
first
beginning
for
from
the
beginning
it
was
not
thus
and
when
he
found
great
fault
with
the
priests
for
their
uncleanness
of
life
and
covetousness
and
would
cleanse
the
temple
from
all
evil
abuses
this
house
saith
he
at
the
first
beginning
it
was
a
house
of
prayer
wherein
all
the
people
might
devoutly
and
sincerely
pray
together
and
so
it
were
your
part
to
use
it
now
also
at
this
day
for
it
was
not
builded
to
the
end
it
should
be
a
den
of
thieves
likewise
all
the
good
and
commendable
princes
mentioned
of
in
the
scriptures
were
praised
specially
by
these
words
that
they
had
walked
in
the
ways
of
their
father
david
that
is
because
they
had
returned
to
the
first
and
original
foundation
and
had
restored
religion
even
to
the
perfection
wherein
david
left
it
and
therefore
when
we
likewise
saw
all
things
were
quite
trodden
under
foot
of
these
men
and
that
nothing
remained
in
the
temple
of
god
but
pitiful
spoils
and
decays
we
reckoned
it
the
wisest
and
the
safest
way
to
set
before
our
eyes
those
churches
which
we
know
for
a
surety
that
they
never
had
erred
nor
never
had
private
mass
nor
prayers
in
a
strange
and
barbarous
language
nor
this
corrupting
of
sacraments
and
other
toys
and
forsomuch
as
our
desire
was
to
have
the
temple
of
the
lord
restored
anew
we
would
seek
none
other
foundation
than
the
same
which
we
know
was
long
ago
laid
by
the
apostles
that
is
to
wit
our
saviour
jesus
christ
and
forasmuch
as
we
heard
god
himself
speaking
unto
us
in
his
word
and
saw
also
the
notable
examples
of
the
old
and
primitive
church
again
how
uncertain
a
matter
it
was
to
wait
for
a
general
council
and
that
the
success
thereof
would
be
much
more
uncertain
but
specially
forsomuch
as
we
were
most
ascertained
of
god
will
and
counted
it
a
wickedness
to
be
too
careful
and
overcumbered
about
the
judgments
of
mortal
men
we
could
no
longer
stand
taking
advice
with
flesh
and
blood
but
rather
thought
good
to
do
the
same
thing
that
both
might
rightly
be
done
and
hath
also
many
a
time
been
done
as
well
of
good
men
as
of
many
catholic
bishops
that
is
to
remedy
our
own
churches
by
a
provincial
synod
for
thus
know
we
the
old
fathers
used
to
put
in
experience
before
they
came
to
the
public
universal
council
there
remain
yet
at
this
day
canons
written
in
councils
of
free
cities
as
of
carthage
under
cyprian
as
of
ancyra
neocaesarea
and
gangra
which
is
in
paphlagonia
as
some
think
before
that
the
name
of
the
general
council
at
nice
was
ever
heard
of
after
this
fashion
in
old
time
did
they
speedily
meet
with
and
cut
short
those
heretics
the
pelagians
and
the
donatists
at
home
by
private
disputation
without
any
general
council
thus
also
when
the
emperor
constantine
evidently
and
earnestly
took
part
with
auxentius
the
bishop
of
the
arians
faction
ambrose
the
bishop
of
the
christians
appealed
not
unto
a
general
council
where
he
saw
no
good
could
be
done
by
reason
of
the
emperor
might
and
great
labour
but
appealed
to
his
own
clergy
and
people
that
is
to
say
to
a
provincial
synod
and
thus
it
was
decreed
in
the
council
at
nice
that
the
bishops
should
assemble
twice
every
year
and
in
the
council
at
carthage
it
was
decreed
that
the
bishops
should
meet
together
in
each
of
their
provinces
at
least
once
in
the
year
which
was
done
as
saith
the
council
of
chalcedon
of
purpose
that
if
any
errors
and
abuses
had
happened
to
spring
up
anywhere
they
might
immediately
at
the
first
entry
be
destroyed
where
they
first
began
so
likewise
when
secundus
and
palladius
rejected
the
council
at
aquileia
because
it
was
not
a
general
and
a
common
council
ambrose
bishop
of
milan
made
answer
that
no
man
ought
to
take
it
for
a
new
or
strange
matter
that
the
bishops
of
the
west
part
of
the
world
did
call
together
synods
and
make
private
assemblies
in
their
provinces
for
that
it
was
a
thing
before
then
used
by
the
west
bishops
no
few
times
and
by
the
bishops
of
greece
used
oftentimes
and
commonly
to
be
done
and
so
charles
the
great
being
emperor
held
a
provincial
council
in
germany
for
putting
away
images
contrary
to
the
second
council
at
nice
neither
pardy
even
amongst
us
is
this
so
very
a
strange
and
new
a
trade
for
we
have
had
ere
now
in
england
provincial
synods
and
governed
our
churches
by
laws
what
should
one
say
more
of
a
truth
even
those
greatest
councils
and
where
most
assembly
of
people
ever
was
whereof
these
men
use
to
make
such
an
exceeding
reckoning
compare
them
with
all
the
churches
which
throughout
the
world
acknowledge
and
profess
the
name
of
christ
and
what
else
i
pray
you
can
they
seem
to
be
but
certain
private
councils
of
bishops
and
provincial
synods
for
admit
peradventure
italy
france
spain
england
germany
denmark
and
scotland
meet
together
if
there
want
asia
greece
armenia
persia
media
mesopotamia
egypt
ethiopia
india
and
mauritania
in
all
which
places
there
be
both
many
christian
men
and
also
bishops
how
can
any
man
being
in
his
right
mind
think
such
a
council
to
be
a
general
council
or
where
so
many
parts
of
the
world
do
lack
how
can
they
truly
say
they
have
the
consent
of
the
whole
world
or
what
manner
of
council
ween
you
was
the
same
last
at
trident
or
how
might
it
be
termed
a
general
council
when
out
of
all
christian
kingdoms
and
nations
there
came
unto
it
but
only
forty
bishops
and
of
the
same
some
so
cunning
that
they
might
be
thought
meet
to
be
sent
home
again
to
learn
their
grammar
and
so
well
learned
that
they
had
never
studied
divinity
whatsoever
it
be
the
truth
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
dependeth
not
upon
councils
nor
as
paul
saith
upon
mortal
creature
judgment
and
if
they
which
ought
to
be
careful
for
god
church
will
not
be
wise
but
slack
their
duty
and
harden
their
hearts
against
god
and
his
christ
going
on
still
to
pervert
the
right
ways
of
the
lord
god
will
stir
up
the
very
stones
and
make
children
and
babes
cunning
whereby
there
may
ever
be
some
to
confute
these
men
lies
for
god
is
able
not
only
without
councils
but
also
will
the
councils
nill
the
councils
to
maintain
and
advance
his
own
kingdom
full
many
be
the
thoughts
of
man
heart
saith
solomon
but
the
counsel
of
the
lord
abideth
steadfast
there
is
no
wisdom
there
is
no
knowledge
there
is
no
counsel
against
the
lord
things
endure
not
saith
hilarius
that
be
set
up
with
men
workmanship
by
another
manner
of
means
must
the
church
of
god
be
builded
and
preserved
for
that
church
is
grounded
upon
the
foundation
of
the
apostles
and
prophets
and
is
holden
fast
together
by
one
corner
stone
which
is
christ
jesu
but
marvellous
notable
and
to
very
good
purpose
for
these
days
be
hierom
words
whosoever
saith
he
the
devil
hath
deceived
and
enticed
to
fall
asleep
as
it
were
with
the
sweet
and
deathly
enchantments
of
the
mermaids
the
syrens
those
persons
doth
god
word
awake
up
saying
unto
them
arise
thou
that
sleepest
lift
up
thyself
and
christ
shall
give
thee
light
therefore
at
the
coming
of
christ
of
god
word
of
the
ecclesiastical
doctrine
and
of
the
full
destruction
of
nineveh
and
of
that
most
beautiful
harlot
then
then
shall
the
people
which
heretofore
had
been
cast
in
a
trance
under
their
masters
be
raised
up
and
shall
make
haste
to
go
to
the
mountains
of
the
scripture
and
there
shall
they
find
hills
moses
verily
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
other
hills
also
which
are
the
prophets
and
hills
of
the
new
testament
which
are
the
apostles
and
the
evangelists
and
when
the
people
shall
flee
for
succour
to
such
hills
and
shall
be
exercised
in
the
reading
of
those
kind
of
mountains
though
they
find
not
one
to
teach
them
for
the
harvest
shall
be
great
but
the
labourers
few
yet
shall
the
good
desire
of
the
people
be
well
accepted
in
that
they
have
gotten
them
to
such
hills
and
the
negligence
of
their
masters
shall
be
openly
reproved
these
be
hierom
sayings
and
that
so
plain
as
there
needeth
no
interpreter
for
they
agree
so
just
with
the
things
we
now
see
with
our
eyes
have
already
come
to
pass
that
we
may
verily
think
that
he
meant
to
foretell
as
it
were
by
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
to
paint
before
our
face
the
universal
state
of
our
time
the
fall
of
the
most
gorgeous
harlot
babylon
the
repairing
again
of
god
church
the
blindness
and
sloth
of
the
bishops
and
the
good
will
and
forwardness
of
the
people
for
who
is
so
blind
that
he
seeth
not
these
men
be
the
masters
by
whom
the
people
as
saith
hierom
hath
been
led
into
error
and
lulled
asleep
or
who
sooth
not
rome
that
is
their
nineveh
which
sometime
was
painted
with
fairest
colours
but
now
her
vizard
being
palled
off
is
both
better
seen
and
less
set
by
or
who
seeth
not
that
good
men
being
awaked
as
it
were
out
of
their
dead
sleep
at
the
light
of
the
gospel
and
at
the
voice
of
god
have
resorted
to
the
hills
of
the
scriptures
waiting
not
at
all
for
the
councils
of
such
masters
but
by
your
favour
some
will
say
these
things
ought
not
to
have
been
attempted
without
the
bishop
of
rome
commandment
forsomuch
as
he
only
is
the
knot
and
band
of
christian
society
he
only
is
that
priest
of
levi
order
whom
god
signified
in
the
deuteronomy
from
whom
counsel
in
matters
of
weight
and
true
judgment
ought
to
be
fetched
and
whoso
obeyeth
not
his
judgment
the
same
man
ought
to
be
killed
in
the
sight
of
his
brethren
and
that
no
mortal
creature
hath
authority
to
be
judge
over
him
whatsoever
he
do
that
christ
reigneth
in
heaven
and
he
in
earth
that
he
alone
can
do
as
much
as
christ
or
god
himself
can
do
because
christ
and
he
have
but
one
that
without
him
is
no
faith
no
hope
no
church
and
whoso
goeth
from
him
quite
casteth
away
and
renounceth
his
own
salvation
such
talk
have
the
canonists
the
parasites
surely
but
with
small
discretion
or
soberness
for
they
could
scant
say
more
at
least
they
could
not
speak
more
highly
of
christ
himself
as
for
us
truly
we
have
fallen
from
the
bishop
of
rome
upon
no
manner
of
worldly
respect
or
commodity
and
would
to
christ
he
so
behaved
himself
as
this
falling
away
needed
not
but
so
the
case
stood
that
unless
we
left
him
we
could
not
come
to
christ
neither
will
he
now
make
any
other
league
with
us
than
such
a
one
as
nahas
the
king
of
the
ammonites
would
have
made
in
times
past
with
them
of
the
city
of
jabez
which
was
to
put
out
the
right
eye
of
each
one
of
the
inhabitants
even
so
will
the
pope
pluck
from
us
the
holy
scripture
the
gospel
of
our
salvation
and
all
the
confidence
which
we
have
in
christ
jesu
and
upon
other
condition
can
he
not
agree
upon
peace
with
us
for
whereas
some
use
to
make
so
great
a
vaunt
that
the
pope
is
only
peter
successor
as
though
thereby
he
carried
the
holy
ghost
in
his
bosom
and
can
not
err
this
is
but
a
matter
of
nothing
and
a
very
trifling
tale
god
grace
is
promised
to
a
good
mind
and
to
one
that
feareth
god
not
unto
sees
and
successions
riches
saith
hierom
may
make
a
bishop
to
be
of
more
might
than
the
rest
but
all
the
bishops
whosoever
they
be
are
the
successors
of
the
apostles
if
so
be
the
place
and
consecrating
only
be
sufficient
why
then
manasses
succeeded
david
and
caiaphas
succeeded
aaron
and
it
hath
been
often
seen
that
an
idol
hath
stand
in
the
temple
of
god
in
old
time
archidamus
the
lacedaemonian
boasted
much
of
himself
how
he
came
of
the
blood
of
hercules
but
one
nicostratus
in
this
wise
abated
his
pride
nay
quoth
he
thou
seemest
not
to
descend
from
hercules
for
hercules
destroyed
ill
men
but
thou
makest
good
men
evil
and
when
the
pharisees
bragged
of
their
lineage
how
they
were
of
the
kindred
and
blood
of
abraham
ye
saith
christ
seek
to
kill
me
a
man
which
have
told
you
the
truth
as
i
heard
it
from
god
thus
abraham
never
did
ye
are
of
your
father
the
devil
and
will
needs
obey
his
will
yet
notwithstanding
because
we
will
grant
somewhat
to
succession
tell
us
hath
the
pope
alone
succeeded
peter
and
wherein
i
pray
you
in
what
religion
in
what
office
in
what
piece
of
his
life
hath
he
succeeded
him
what
one
thing
tell
me
had
peter
ever
like
unto
the
pope
or
the
pope
like
unto
peter
except
peradventure
they
will
say
thus
that
peter
when
he
was
at
rome
never
taught
the
gospel
never
fed
the
flock
took
away
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
hid
the
treasures
of
his
lord
sat
him
down
only
in
his
castle
in
john
lateran
and
pointed
out
with
his
finger
all
the
places
of
purgatory
and
kinds
of
punishments
committing
some
poor
souls
to
be
tormented
and
other
some
again
suddenly
releasing
thence
at
his
own
pleasure
taking
money
for
so
doing
or
that
he
gave
order
to
say
private
masses
in
every
corner
or
that
he
mumbled
up
the
holy
service
with
a
low
voice
and
in
an
unknown
language
or
that
he
hanged
up
the
sacrament
in
every
temple
and
on
every
altar
and
carried
the
same
about
before
him
whithersoever
he
went
upon
an
ambling
jannet
with
lights
and
bells
or
that
he
consecrated
with
his
holy
breath
oil
wax
wool
bells
chalices
churches
and
altars
or
that
he
sold
jubilees
graces
liberties
advowsons
preventions
first
fruits
palls
the
wearing
of
palls
bulls
indulgences
and
pardons
or
that
he
called
himself
by
the
name
of
the
head
of
the
church
the
highest
bishop
bishop
of
bishops
alone
most
holy
or
that
by
usurping
he
took
upon
himself
the
right
and
authority
over
other
folk
churches
or
that
he
exempted
himself
from
the
power
of
any
civil
government
or
that
he
maintained
wars
and
set
princes
together
at
variance
or
that
he
sitting
in
his
chair
with
his
triple
crown
full
of
labels
with
sumptuous
and
gorgeousness
with
his
royal
sceptre
with
his
diadem
of
gold
and
glittering
with
stones
was
carried
about
not
upon
palfrey
but
upon
the
shoulders
of
noble
men
these
things
no
doubt
did
peter
at
rome
in
times
past
and
left
them
in
charge
to
his
successors
as
you
would
say
from
hand
to
hand
for
these
things
be
done
at
rome
by
the
popes
and
be
so
done
as
though
nothing
else
ought
to
be
done
or
contrariwise
peradventure
they
had
rather
say
thus
that
the
pope
doth
now
all
the
same
things
which
we
know
peter
did
many
a
day
ago
that
is
that
he
runneth
up
and
down
into
every
country
to
preach
the
gospel
not
only
openly
abroad
but
also
privately
from
house
to
house
that
he
is
diligent
and
applieth
that
business
in
season
and
out
of
season
in
due
time
and
out
of
due
time
that
he
doth
the
part
of
an
evangelist
that
he
fulfilleth
the
work
and
ministry
of
christ
that
he
is
the
watchman
of
the
house
of
israel
receiveth
answers
and
words
at
god
mouth
and
even
as
he
receiveth
them
so
delivereth
them
over
to
the
people
that
he
is
the
salt
of
the
earth
that
he
is
the
light
of
the
world
that
he
doth
not
feed
his
own
self
but
his
flock
that
he
doth
not
entangle
himself
with
the
worldly
cares
of
this
life
that
he
doth
not
use
a
sovereignty
over
the
people
that
he
seeketh
not
to
have
other
men
minister
to
him
but
himself
rather
to
minister
unto
others
that
he
taketh
all
bishops
as
his
fellows
and
equals
that
he
is
subject
to
princes
as
to
persons
sent
from
god
that
he
giveth
to
caesar
that
which
is
caesar
and
that
he
as
the
old
bishops
of
rome
did
without
any
question
calleth
the
emperor
his
lord
unless
therefore
the
popes
do
the
like
and
peter
did
the
things
aforesaid
there
is
no
cause
at
all
why
they
should
glory
so
of
peter
name
and
of
his
succession
much
less
cause
have
they
to
complain
of
our
departing
and
to
call
us
again
to
be
fellows
and
friends
with
them
and
to
believe
as
they
believe
men
say
that
one
cobilon
a
lacedaemonian
when
he
was
sent
ambassador
to
the
king
of
the
persians
to
treat
of
a
league
and
found
by
chance
them
of
the
court
playing
at
dice
he
returned
straightway
home
again
leaving
his
message
undone
and
when
he
was
asked
why
he
did
slack
to
do
the
things
which
he
had
received
by
public
commission
to
do
he
made
answer
he
thought
it
should
be
a
great
reproach
to
his
commonwealth
to
make
a
league
with
dicers
but
if
we
should
content
ourselves
to
return
to
the
pope
and
to
his
popish
errors
and
to
make
a
covenant
not
only
with
dicers
but
also
with
men
far
more
ungracious
and
wicked
than
any
dicers
be
besides
that
this
should
be
a
great
blot
to
our
good
name
it
should
also
be
a
very
dangerous
matter
both
to
kindle
god
wrath
against
us
and
to
clog
and
condemn
our
own
souls
for
ever
for
of
very
truth
we
have
departed
from
him
who
we
saw
had
blinded
the
whole
world
this
many
a
hundred
year
from
him
who
too
far
presumptuously
was
wont
to
say
he
could
not
err
and
whatsoever
he
did
no
mortal
man
had
power
to
condemn
him
neither
kings
nor
emperors
nor
the
whole
clergy
nor
yet
all
the
people
in
the
world
together
no
and
though
he
should
carry
away
with
him
to
hell
a
thousand
souls
from
him
who
took
upon
him
power
to
command
not
only
men
but
even
god
angels
to
go
to
return
to
lead
souls
into
purgatory
and
to
bring
them
back
again
when
he
list
himself
whom
gregory
said
without
all
doubt
is
the
very
forerunner
and
of
antichrist
and
hath
utterly
forsaken
the
catholic
faith
from
whom
also
these
ringleaders
of
ours
who
now
with
might
and
main
resist
the
gospel
and
the
truth
which
they
know
to
be
the
truth
have
ere
this
departed
every
one
of
their
own
accord
and
goodwill
and
would
even
now
also
gladly
depart
from
him
if
the
note
of
inconstancy
and
shame
and
their
own
estimation
among
the
people
were
not
a
let
unto
them
in
conclusion
we
have
departed
from
him
to
whom
we
were
not
bound
and
who
had
nothing
to
say
for
himself
but
only
i
know
not
what
virtue
or
power
of
the
place
where
he
dwelleth
and
a
continuance
of
succession
and
as
for
us
we
of
all
others
most
justly
have
left
him
for
our
kings
yea
even
they
which
with
greatest
reverence
did
follow
and
obey
the
authority
and
faith
of
the
bishops
of
rome
have
long
since
found
and
felt
well
enough
the
yoke
and
tyranny
of
the
pope
kingdom
for
the
bishops
of
rome
took
the
crown
off
from
the
head
of
our
king
henry
the
second
and
compelled
him
to
put
aside
all
majesty
and
like
a
mere
private
man
to
come
unto
their
legate
with
great
submission
and
humility
so
as
all
his
subjects
might
laugh
him
to
scorn
more
than
this
they
caused
bishops
and
monks
and
some
part
of
the
nobility
to
be
in
the
field
against
our
king
john
and
set
all
the
people
at
liberty
from
their
oaths
whereby
they
ought
allegiance
to
their
king
and
at
last
wickedly
and
most
abominably
they
bereaved
the
king
not
only
of
his
kingdom
but
also
of
his
life
besides
this
they
excommunicated
and
cursed
king
henry
the
eighth
that
most
famous
prince
and
stirred
up
against
him
sometime
the
emperor
sometime
the
french
king
and
as
much
as
in
them
was
put
in
adventure
our
realm
to
have
been
a
very
prey
and
spoil
yet
were
they
but
fools
and
mad
to
think
that
either
so
mighty
a
prince
could
be
scared
with
bugs
and
rattles
or
else
that
so
noble
and
great
a
kingdom
might
so
easily
even
at
one
morsel
be
devoured
and
swallowed
up
and
yet
as
though
all
this
were
too
little
they
would
needs
make
all
the
realm
tributary
to
them
and
exacted
thence
yearly
most
unjust
and
wrongful
taxes
so
dear
cost
us
the
friendship
of
the
city
of
rome
wherefore
if
they
have
gotten
these
things
of
us
by
extortion
through
their
fraud
and
subtle
sleights
we
see
no
reason
why
we
may
not
pluck
away
the
same
from
them
again
by
lawful
ways
and
just
means
and
if
our
kings
in
that
darkness
and
blindness
of
former
times
gave
them
these
things
of
their
own
accord
and
liberality
for
religion
sake
being
moved
with
a
certain
opinion
of
their
feigned
holiness
now
when
ignorance
and
error
is
espied
out
may
the
kings
their
successors
take
them
away
again
seeing
they
have
the
same
authority
the
kings
their
ancestors
had
before
for
the
gift
is
void
except
it
be
hallowed
by
the
will
of
the
giver
and
that
can
not
seem
a
perfect
will
which
is
dimmed
and
hindered
by
error
the
recapitulation
of
the
apology
thus
good
christian
reader
ye
see
how
it
is
no
new
thing
though
at
this
day
the
religion
of
christ
be
entertained
with
despites
and
checks
being
but
lately
restored
and
as
it
were
coming
up
again
anew
forsomuch
as
the
like
hath
chanced
both
to
christ
himself
and
to
his
apostles
yet
nevertheless
for
fear
ye
may
suffer
yourself
to
be
led
amiss
and
seduced
with
these
exclamations
of
our
adversaries
we
have
declared
at
large
unto
you
the
very
whole
manner
of
our
religion
what
our
opinion
is
of
god
the
father
of
his
only
son
jesus
christ
of
the
holy
ghost
of
the
church
of
the
sacraments
of
the
ministry
of
the
scriptures
of
ceremonies
and
of
every
part
of
christian
belief
we
have
said
that
we
abandon
and
detest
as
plagues
and
poisons
all
those
old
heresies
which
either
the
sacred
scriptures
or
the
ancient
councils
have
utterly
condemned
that
we
call
home
again
as
much
as
ever
we
can
the
right
discipline
of
the
church
which
our
adversaries
have
quite
brought
into
a
poor
and
weak
case
that
we
punish
all
licentiousness
of
life
and
unruliness
of
manners
by
the
old
and
laws
and
with
as
much
sharpness
as
is
convenient
and
lieth
in
our
power
that
we
maintain
still
the
state
of
kingdoms
in
the
same
condition
and
plight
wherein
we
have
found
them
without
any
diminishing
or
alteration
reserving
unto
our
princes
their
majesties
and
worldly
safe
and
without
impairing
to
our
possible
power
that
we
have
so
gotten
ourselves
away
from
that
church
which
they
had
made
a
den
of
thieves
and
wherein
nothing
was
in
good
frame
or
once
like
to
the
church
of
god
and
which
themselves
confessed
had
erred
many
ways
even
as
lot
in
times
past
gat
him
out
of
sodom
or
abraham
out
of
chaldea
not
upon
a
desire
of
contention
but
by
the
warning
of
god
himself
and
that
we
have
searched
out
of
the
holy
bible
which
we
are
sure
can
not
deceive
one
sure
form
of
religion
and
have
returned
again
unto
the
primitive
church
of
the
ancient
fathers
and
apostles
that
is
to
say
to
the
first
ground
and
beginning
of
things
as
unto
the
very
foundations
and
headsprings
of
christ
church
and
in
very
truth
we
have
not
tarried
for
in
this
matter
the
authority
or
consent
of
the
tridentine
council
wherein
we
saw
nothing
done
uprightly
nor
by
good
order
where
also
everybody
was
sworn
to
the
maintenance
of
one
man
where
our
ambassadors
were
contemned
where
not
one
of
our
divines
could
be
heard
and
where
and
ambition
was
openly
and
earnestly
procured
and
wrought
but
as
the
holy
fathers
in
former
time
and
as
our
predecessors
have
commonly
done
we
have
restored
our
churches
by
a
provincial
convocation
and
have
clean
shaken
off
as
our
duty
was
the
yoke
and
tyranny
of
the
bishop
of
rome
to
whom
we
were
not
bound
who
also
had
no
manner
of
thing
like
neither
to
christ
nor
to
peter
nor
to
an
apostle
nor
yet
like
to
any
bishop
at
all
finally
we
say
that
we
agree
amongst
ourselves
touching
the
whole
judgment
and
chief
substance
of
christian
religion
and
with
one
mouth
and
with
one
spirit
do
worship
god
and
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
wherefore
o
christian
and
godly
reader
forasmuch
as
thou
seest
the
reasons
and
causes
both
why
we
have
restored
religion
and
why
we
have
forsaken
these
men
thou
oughtest
not
to
marvel
though
we
have
chosen
to
obey
our
master
christ
rather
than
men
paul
hath
given
us
warning
how
we
should
not
suffer
ourselves
to
be
carried
away
with
such
sundry
learnings
and
to
fly
their
companies
in
especial
which
would
sow
debate
and
variances
clean
contrary
to
the
doctrine
which
they
had
received
of
christ
and
the
apostles
long
since
have
these
men
crafts
and
treacheries
decayed
and
vanished
and
fled
away
at
the
sight
and
light
of
the
gospel
even
as
the
owl
doth
at
the
and
albeit
their
trumpery
be
built
up
and
reared
as
high
as
the
sky
yea
even
in
a
moment
and
as
it
were
of
the
own
self
falleth
it
down
again
to
the
ground
and
cometh
to
nought
for
you
must
not
think
that
all
these
things
have
come
to
pass
rashly
or
at
adventure
it
hath
been
pleasure
that
against
all
men
wills
well
nigh
the
gospel
of
jesu
christ
should
be
spread
abroad
throughout
the
whole
world
at
these
days
and
therefore
men
following
god
biddings
have
of
their
own
free
will
resorted
unto
the
doctrine
of
jesus
christ
and
for
our
parts
truly
we
have
sought
hereby
neither
glory
nor
wealth
nor
pleasure
nor
ease
for
there
is
plenty
of
all
these
things
with
our
adversaries
and
when
we
were
of
their
side
we
enjoyed
such
worldly
commodities
much
more
liberally
and
bountifully
than
we
do
now
neither
do
we
eschew
concord
and
peace
but
to
have
peace
with
man
we
will
not
be
at
war
with
god
the
name
of
peace
is
a
sweet
and
pleasant
thing
saith
hilarius
but
yet
beware
saith
he
peace
is
one
thing
and
bondage
is
another
for
if
it
should
so
be
as
they
seek
to
have
it
that
christ
should
be
commanded
to
keep
silence
that
the
truth
of
the
gospel
should
be
betrayed
that
horrible
errors
should
be
cloaked
that
christian
men
eyes
should
be
bleared
and
that
they
might
be
suffered
to
conspire
openly
against
god
this
were
not
a
peace
but
a
most
ungodly
covenant
of
servitude
there
is
a
peace
saith
nazianzen
that
is
unprofitable
again
there
is
a
discord
saith
he
that
is
profitable
for
we
must
conditionally
desire
peace
so
far
as
is
lawful
before
god
and
so
far
as
we
may
conveniently
for
otherwise
christ
himself
brought
not
peace
into
the
world
but
a
sword
wherefore
if
the
pope
will
have
us
be
reconciled
to
him
his
duty
is
first
to
be
reconciled
to
god
for
from
thence
saith
cyprian
spring
schisms
and
sects
because
men
seek
not
the
head
and
have
not
their
recourse
to
the
fountain
of
the
scriptures
and
keep
not
the
rules
given
by
the
heavenly
teacher
for
saith
he
that
is
not
peace
but
war
neither
is
he
joined
unto
the
church
which
is
severed
from
the
gospel
as
for
these
men
they
used
to
make
a
merchandise
of
the
name
of
peace
for
that
peace
which
they
so
fain
would
have
is
only
a
rest
of
idle
bellies
they
and
we
might
easily
be
brought
to
atonement
touching
all
these
matters
were
it
not
that
ambition
gluttony
and
excess
did
let
it
hence
cometh
their
whining
their
heart
is
on
their
halfpenny
out
of
doubt
their
clamours
and
stirs
be
to
none
other
end
but
to
maintain
more
shamefully
and
naughtily
things
nowadays
the
pardoners
complain
of
us
the
dataries
the
collectors
the
bawds
and
others
which
take
gain
to
be
godliness
and
serve
not
jesus
christ
but
their
own
bellies
many
a
day
ago
and
in
the
old
world
a
wonderful
great
advantage
grew
hereby
to
these
kinds
of
people
but
now
they
reckon
all
is
lost
unto
them
that
christ
gaineth
the
pope
himself
maketh
a
great
complaint
at
this
present
that
charity
in
people
is
waxen
cold
and
why
so
trow
ye
forsooth
because
his
profits
decay
more
and
more
and
for
this
cause
doth
he
hale
us
into
hatred
all
that
ever
he
may
laying
load
upon
us
with
despiteful
railings
and
condemning
us
for
heretics
to
the
end
they
that
understand
not
the
matter
may
think
there
be
no
worse
men
upon
earth
than
we
be
notwithstanding
we
in
the
mean
season
are
never
the
more
ashamed
for
all
this
neither
ought
we
to
be
ashamed
of
the
gospel
for
we
set
more
by
the
glory
of
god
than
we
do
by
the
estimation
of
men
we
are
sure
all
is
true
that
we
teach
and
we
may
not
either
go
against
our
own
conscience
or
bear
any
witness
against
god
for
if
we
deny
any
part
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
before
men
he
on
the
other
side
will
deny
us
before
his
father
and
if
there
be
any
that
will
still
be
offended
and
can
not
endure
christ
doctrine
such
say
we
be
blind
and
leaders
of
the
blind
the
truth
nevertheless
must
be
preached
and
preferred
above
all
and
we
must
with
patience
wait
for
god
judgment
let
these
folk
in
the
meantime
take
good
heed
what
they
do
and
let
them
be
well
advised
of
their
own
salvation
and
cease
to
hate
and
persecute
the
gospel
of
the
son
of
god
for
fear
lest
they
feel
him
once
a
redresser
and
revenger
of
his
own
cause
god
will
not
suffer
himself
to
be
made
a
mocking
stock
the
world
espieth
a
good
while
agone
what
there
is
a
doing
abroad
this
flame
the
more
it
is
kept
down
so
much
the
more
with
greater
force
and
strength
doth
it
break
out
and
fly
abroad
their
unfaithfulness
shall
not
disappoint
god
faithful
promise
and
if
they
shall
refuse
to
lay
away
this
their
hardness
of
heart
and
to
receive
the
gospel
of
christ
then
shall
publicans
and
sinners
go
before
them
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
god
and
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
open
the
eyes
of
them
all
that
they
may
be
able
to
see
that
blessed
hope
whereunto
they
have
been
called
so
as
we
may
altogether
in
one
glorify
him
alone
who
is
the
true
god
and
also
that
same
jesus
christ
whom
he
sent
down
to
us
from
heaven
unto
whom
with
the
father
and
the
holy
ghost
be
given
all
honour
and
glory
everlastingly
so
be
it
