the
strange
history
of
a
mysterious

the
account
of
a
remarkable

as
communicated
in

to

to

who
reviewed
the
manuscript
of
this
work
i
am
indebted
for
many
valuable
suggestions
and
i
can
not
speak
too
kindly
of
him
as
a
critic
the
illustrations
excepting
those
mechanical
and
historical
making
in
themselves
a
beautiful
narrative
without
words
are
due
to
the
admirable
artistic
conceptions
and
touch
of
augustus
knapp
structural
imperfections
as
well
as
word
selections
and
phrases
that
break
all
rules
in
composition
and
that
the
care
even
of
venable
could
not
eradicate
i
accept
as
wholly
my
own
for
much
on
the
one
hand
that
it
may
seem
should
have
been
excluded
and
on
the
other
for
giving
place
to
ideas
nearer
to
empiricism
than
to
science
i
am
also
responsible
for
vexing
my
friends
with
problems
that
seemingly
do
not
concern
in
the
least
men
in
my
position
and
for
venturing
to
think
superficially
it
may
be
outside
the
restricted
lines
of
a
science
bound
to
the
unresponsive
crucible
and
retort
to
which
my
life
has
been
given
and
amid
the
problems
of
which
it
has
nearly
worn
itself
away
i
have
no
plausible
excuse
and
shall
seek
none

books
are
as
tombstones
made
by
the
living
for
the
living
but
destined
soon
only
to
remind
us
of
the
dead
the
preface
like
an
epitaph
seems
vainly
to
implore
the
passing
tribute
of
a
moment
interest
no
man
is
allured
by
either
a
or
a
preface
unless
it
be
accompanied
by
that
ineffable
charm
which
age
casts
over
mortal
productions
libraries
in
one
sense
represent
cemeteries
and
the
rows
of
silent
volumes
with
their
dim
titles
suggest
burial
tablets
many
of
which
alas
mark
only
cenotaphs
empty
tombs
a
modern
book
no
matter
how
talented
the
author
carries
with
it
a
familiar
personality
which
may
often
be
treated
with
neglect
or
even
contempt
but
a
volume
a
century
old
demands
some
reverence
a
or
print
or
antique
yellow
parchment
two
three
five
hundred
years
old
regardless
of
its
contents
impresses
one
with
an
indescribable
feeling
akin
to
awe
and
veneration
as
does
the
wheat
from
an
egyptian
tomb
even
though
it
be
only
wheat
we
take
such
a
work
from
the
shelf
carefully
and
replace
it
gently
while
the
productions
of
modern
writers
are
handled
familiarly
as
men
living
jostle
men
yet
alive
those
of
authors
long
dead
are
touched
as
tho
clutched
by
a
hand
from
the
unseen
world
the
reader
feels
that
a
phantom
form
opposes
his
own
and
that
spectral
eyes
scan
the
pages
as
he
turns
them

the
stern

penetrating
eye
of

whose
likeness
forms
the

the
yellowed
volume
in
my
hand

across
the
gulf
of
two
centuries
and
bid
me
beware
the
title

is
read
with
reverence
and
the
great
tome
is
replaced
with
care
for
an
almost
superstitious
sensation
bids
me
be
cautious
and
not
offend
let
those
who
presume
to
criticise
the
intellectual
productions
of
such
men
be
careful
in
a
few
days
the
dead
will
face
their
censors
dead
standing
in
a
library
of
antiquated
works
one
senses
the
shadows
of
a
cemetery
each
volume
adds
to
the
oppression
each
old
tome
casts
the
influence
of
its
spirit
over
the
beholder
for

not

the

while
only
a
strong
imagination
can
assume
that
a
spirit
hovers
over
and
lingers
around
inanimate
clay
here
each
title
is
a
voice
that
speaks

still
throbbed

ah
this

is
not
as
is

only
a
cemetery
for

it

skeleton
forms
oppose
my

with
the
object
of
carrying
to
the
future
a
section
of
thought
current
from
the
past
the
antiquarian
libraries
of
many
nations
have
been
culled
and
purchases
made
in
every
book
market
of
the
world
these
books
surround
me
naturally
many
persons
have
become
interested
in
the
movement
and
considering
it
a
worthy
one
unite
to
further
the
project
for
the
purpose
is
not
personal
gain
thus
it
is
not
unusual
for
boxes
of
old
chemical
or
pharmacal
volumes
to
arrive
by
freight
or
express
without
a
word
as
to
the
donor
the
mail
brings
manuscripts
unprinted
and
pamphlets
recondite
with
no
word
of
introduction
they
come
unheralded
the
authors
or
the
senders
realize
that
in
this
unique
library
a
place
is
vacant
if
any
work
on
connected
subjects
is
missing
and
thinking
men
of
the
world
are
uniting
their
contributions
to
fill
such
vacancies
enough
has
been
said
concerning
the
ancient
library
that
has
bred
these
reflections
and
my
own
personality
does
not
concern
the
reader
he
can
now
formulate
his
conclusions
as
well
perhaps
as
i
regarding
the
origin
of
the
manuscript
that
is
to
follow
if
he
concerns
himself
at
all
over
subjects
mysterious
or
historical
and
my
connection
therewith
is
of
minor
importance
whether
drury
brought
the
strange
paper
in
person
or
sent
it
by
express
or
mail
whether
it
was
slipped
into
a
box
of
books
from
foreign
lands
or
whether
my
hand
held
the
pen
that
made
the
record
whether
i
stood
face
to
face
with
drury
in
the
shadows
of
this
room
or
have
but
a
fanciful
conception
of
his
figure
whether
the
artist
drew
upon
his
imagination
for
the
vivid
likeness
of
the
several
personages
figured
in
the
book
that
follows
or
from
reliable
data
has
given
authentic
is
immaterial
sufficient
be
it
to
say
that
the
manuscript
of
this
book
has
been
in
my
possession
for
a
period
of
seven
years
and
my
lips
must
now
be
sealed
concerning
all
that
transpired
in
connection
therewith
outside
the
recorded
therein
and
yet
i
can
not
deny
that
for
these
seven
years
i
have
hesitated
concerning
my
proper
course
and
more
than
once
have
decided
to
cover
from
sight
the
fascinating
leaflets
hide
them
among
surrounding
volumes
and
let
them
slumber
until
chance
should
bring
them
to
the
attention
of
the
future
student
these
thoughts
rise
before
me
this
gloomy
day
of
december
as
snatching
a
moment
from
the
exactions
of
business
i
sit
among
these
old
volumes
devoted
to
and
again
study
over
the
unique
manuscript
and
meditate
i
hesitate
again
shall
i
or
shall
i
not
but
a
duty
is
a
duty
perhaps
the
mysterious
part
of
the
subject
will
be
cleared
to
me
only
when
my
own
come
to
rest
among
these
venerable
relics
of
the
past
when
books
that
i
have
written
become
companions
of
ancient
works
about
me
for
then
i
can
claim
relationship
with
the
shadows
that
flit
in
and
out
and
can
demand
that
they
the
ghosts
of
the
library
commune
with
the
shade
that
guards

many
letters
imparting

relating
to

early
history
and
asking
many
questions
concerning
a
man
of
whose
memory
the
writer
thinks
so
highly
but
whose
name
is
generally
unknown
indeed
as
some
have
even
argued
that
the
author
of

has
no
personal
existence
the

being
a

so
others
have
accepted
professor
vaughn
to
have
been
a
fanciful
creation
of
the
mystical
author
professor
daniel

was
one
whose
life
lines
ran
nearly
parallel
with
those
of
the
late
professor
rafinesque
whose
eventful
history
has
been
so
graphically
written
by
professor
ellsworth
call
the
cups
of
these
two
talented
men
were
filled
with
privation
bitterness
and
in
no
other
place
has
this

known
the
phrase
the
deadly
parallel
so
aptly
appropriate
both
came
to
america
scholars
scientists
by
education
both
traveled
through
kentucky
teachers
both
gave
freely
to
the
world
and
both
suffered
in
their
old
age
dying
in
poverty
rafinesque
perishing
in
misery
in
philadelphia
and
vaughn
in
cincinnati
daniel
vaughn
was
not
a
myth
and
in
order
that
the
reader
may
know
something
of
the
life
and
fate
of
this
eccentric
man
an
appendix
has
been
added
to
this
edition
of
etidorhpa
in
which
a
picture
of
his
face
is
shown
as
the
writer
knew
it
in
life
and
in
which
brief
mention
is
made
of
his
record
the
author
here
extends
his
thanks
to
professor
richard
nelson
and
to
father
eugene
brady
for
their
kindness
to
the
readers
of
etidorhpa
and

pharmaceutical
era
new

october
in
cincinnati
is
one
of
the
most
famous
botanical
and
pharmacal
libraries
in
the
world
and
by
scientists
it
is
regarded
as
an
invaluable
store
of
knowledge
upon
those
branches
of
medical
science
so
famous
is
it
that
one
of
the
most
noted
pharmacologists
and
chemists
of
germany
on
a
recent
trip
to
this
country
availed
himself
of
its
rich
collection
as
a
necessary
means
of
completing
his
study
in
the
line
of
special
drug
history
when
it
is
known
that
he
has
devoted
a
life
of
nearly
eighty
years
to
the
study
of
pharmacology
and
is
an
emeritus
professor
in
the
famous
university
of
strassburg
the
importance
of
his
action
will
be
understood
and
appreciated
we
refer

who
in
connection
with
daniel

of
almost
every
civilized
country
on
the
globe
the
collections
are
the
work
of
two
brothers
begun
when
in
early
boyhood
in
money
they
are
priceless
yet
it
is
the
intention
of
the
founders
that
they
shall
be
placed
either
before
or
at
their
death
in
some
college
or
university
where
all
students
may
have
access
to
them
without
cost
or
favor
and
their
wills
are
already
made
to
this
end
although
the
institution
to
receive
the
bequest
is
not
yet
selected
eager
requests
have
been
made
that
they
be
sent
to
foreign
universities
where
only
some
persons
believe
they
can
receive
the
appreciation
they
deserve

lloyd
every
hour
that
can
be
spent
by
these

from

or
necessary
recreation
is
spent
here
lloyd
devotes
himself
entirely
to
the
study
of
botany
and
connected
subjects
while
his

is
equally
devoted
to
materia

in
the
botanical
department
are
the
best
works
obtainable
in
every
country
and
there
the
study
of
botany
may
be
carried
to
any
height
in
point
of
age
some
of
them
go
back
almost
to
the
time
when
the
art
of
printing
was
discovered
two
copies
of
aristotle
are
notable
a
greek
version
bound
in
vellum
was
printed
in
another
in

in
excellent
preservation
a

rarity
two
editions
is
the
historia
plantarum
by
pinaeus
which
was
issued
one
in
the
other
in
it
appears
to
have
been
a
first
attempt
at
the
production
of
colored
plates
plants
that
were
rare
at
that
time
are
colored
by
hand
and
then
have
a

the
colors
still
to
be
as
bright

an
extremely
odd
work
is

is
conceded
to
be
mons
tournefort
whose
comprehensive
work
was
published
in
it
is
the
fortune
of
lloyd
to
possess
an
original
edition
in
good

his

this
rare

was
presented
to

by
charles

who
informed
the
lloyds
that
only
one
other
set
could
be
found
in
america
one
of
the
most
noted
books
in
the
collection
of
lloyd
is
a
materia

written
by
david
schoepf
a
learned
german
scholar
who
traveled
through
this
country
in
but
a
limited
number
of
copies
were
printed
and
but
few
are
extant
one
is
in
the
erlangen
library
in
germany
this
lloyd
secured
and
had
it
copied
verbatim
in
later
years
charles
rice
obtained
an
original
print
and
exchanged
it
for
that
copy
a
like
work
is
that
of
jonathan

of
the
provincial

in
america
published
in

it
treats
largely
of
canadian

also
adorns
this
part
of
the

in
addition
to
almost
every
work
on

subject
lloyd
possesses
complete
editions
of
the
leading
serials
and

prologue
my
name
was
johannes
llewellyn
llongollyn
drury
i
was
named
llewellyn
at
my
mother
desire
out
of
respect
to
her
father
evan
llewellyn
the
scientist
and
speculative
philosopher
well
known
to
curious
students
as
the
author
of
various
rare
works
on
occult
subjects
the
other
given
names
were
ancestral
also
but
when
i
reached
the
age
of
appreciation
they
naturally
became
distasteful
so
it
is
that
in
early
youth
i
dropped
the
first
and
third
of
these
cumbersome
words
and
retained
only
the
second
christian
name
while
perhaps
the
reader
of
these
lines
may
regard
this
cognomen
with
less
favor
than
either
of
the
others
still
i
liked
it
as
it
was
the
favorite
of
my
mother
who
always
used
the
name
in
full
the
world
however
contracted
llewellyn
to
lew
much
to
the
distress
of
my
dear
mother
who
felt
aggrieved
at
the
liberty
after
her
death
i
decided
to
move
to
a
western
city
and
also
determined
out
of
respect
to
her
memory
to
select
from
and
rearrange
the
letters
of
my
several
names
and
construct
therefrom
three
short
terse
words
which
would
convey
to
myself
only
the
resemblance
of
my
former
name
hence
it
is
that
the
cincinnati
directory
does
not
record
my
name
which
i
have
no
reason
to
bring
before
the
public
to
the
reader
my
name
is
llewellyn
drury
i
might
add
that
my
ancestors
were
among
the
early
settlers
of
what
is
now
new
york
city
and
were
direct
descendants
of
the
early
welsh
kings
but
these
matters
do
not
concern
the
reader
and
it
is
not
of
them
that
i
now
choose
to
write
my
object
in
putting
down
these
preliminary
paragraphs
is
simply
to
assure
the
reader
of
such
facts
and
such
only
as
may
give
him
confidence
in
my
personal
sincerity
and
responsibility
in
order
that
he
may
with
a
right
understanding
read
the
remarkable
statements
that
occur
in
the
succeeding
chapters
the
story
i
am
about
to
relate
is
very
direct
and
some
parts
of
it
are
very
strange
not
to
say
marvelous
but
not
on
account
of
its
strangeness
alone
do
i
ask
for
the
narrative
a
reading
that
were
mere
trifling
what
is
here
set
down
happened
as
recorded
but
i
shall
not
attempt
to
explain
things
which
even
to
myself
are
enigmatical
let
the
candid
reader
read
the
story
as
i
have
told
it
and
make
out
of
it
what
he
can
or
let
him
pass
the
page
by
unread
i
shall
not
insist
on
claiming
his
further
attention
only
if
he
does
read
i
beg
him
to
read
with
an
open
mind
without
prejudice
and
without
predilection
who
or
what
i
am
as
a
participant
in
this
work
is
of
small
importance
i
mention
my
history
only
for
the
sake
of
frankness
and
fairness
i
have
nothing
to
gain
by
issuing
the
volume
neither
do
i
court
praise
nor
shun
censure
my
purpose
is
to
tell
the
truth
early
in
the
fifties
i
took
up
my
residence
in
the
queen
city
and
though
a
very
young
man
found
the
employment
ready
that
a
friend
had
obtained
for
me
with
a
manufacturing
firm
engaged
in
a
large
and
complicated
business
my
duties
were
varied
and
peculiar
of
such
a
nature
as
to
tax
body
and
mind
to
the
utmost
and
for
several
years
i
served
in
the
most
exacting
of
business
details
besides
the
labor
which
my
vocation
entailed
with
its
manifold
and
multiform
perplexities
i
voluntarily
imposed
upon
myself
other
tasks
which
i
pursued
in
the
privacy
of
my
own
bachelor
apartments
an
inherited
love
for
books
on
abstruse
and
occult
subjects
probably
in
part
the
result
of
my
blood
connection
with
evan
llewellyn
caused
me
to
collect
a
unique
library
largely
on
mystical
subjects
in
which
i
took
the
keenest
delight
my
business
and
my
professional
duties
by
day
and
my
studies
at
night
made
my
life
a
busy
one
in
the
midst
of
my
work
and
reading
i
encountered
the
character
whose
strange
story
forms
the
essential
part
of
the
following
narrative
i
may
anticipate
by
saying
that
the
manuscript
to
follow
only
incidentally
concerns
myself
and
that
if
possible
i
would
relinquish
all
connection
therewith
it
recites
the
physical
mental
and
moral
adventures
of
one
whose
life
history
was
abruptly
thrust
upon
my
attention
and
as
abruptly
interrupted
the
vicissitudes
of
his
body
and
soul
circumstances
seemed
to
compel
me
to
learn
and
to
make
public
etidorpha
chapter
i
never
less
alone
than
when
alone
more
than
thirty
years
ago
occurred
the
first
of
the
series
of
remarkable
events
i
am
about
to
relate
the
exact
date
i
can
not
recall
but
it
was
in
november
and
to
those
familiar
with
november
weather
in
the
ohio
valley
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
state
that
the
month
is
one
of
possibilities
that
is
to
say
it
is
liable
to
bring
every
variety
of
weather
from
the
delicious
dreamy
indian
summer
days
that
linger
late
in
the
fall
to
a
combination
of
rain
hail
snow
sleet
in
short
atmospheric
conditions
sufficiently
aggravating
to
develop
a
suicidal
mania
in
any
one
the
least
susceptible
to
such
influences
while
the
general
character
of
the
month
is
much
the
same
the
country
over
showing
dull
grey
tones
of
sky
abundant
rains
that
penetrate
man
as
they
do
the
earth
cold
shifting
winds
that
search
the
very
marrow
it
is
always
safe
to
count
more
or
less
upon
the
probability
of
the
unexpected
throughout
the
month
the
particular
day
which
ushered
in
the
event
about
to
be
chronicled
was
one
of
these
possible
heterogeneous
days
presenting
a
combination
of
sunshine
shower
and
snow
with
winds
that
rang
all
the
changes
from
balmy
to
blustery
a
morning
air
of
caloric
and
an
evening
of
numbing
cold
the
early
morning
started
fair
and
sunny
later
came
light
showers
suddenly
switched
by
shifting
winds
into
blinding
sleet
until
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
found
the
four
winds
and
all
the
elements
commingled
in
one
wild
orgy
with
clashing
and
roaring
as
of
a
great
organ
with
all
the
stops
out
and
all
the
dancing
over
the
nightfall
brought
some
semblance
of
order
to
the
sounding
chaos
but
still
kept
up
the
wild
music
of
a
typical
november
day
with
every
accompaniment
of
bleakness
gloom
and
desolation
thousands
of
chimneys
exhaling
murky
clouds
of
bituminous
soot
all
day
had
covered
the
city
with
the
proverbial
pall
which
the
winds
in
their
sport
had
shifted
hither
and
yon
but
as
thoroughly
tired
out
they
subsided
into
silence
the
smoky
mesh
suddenly
settled
over
the
houses
and
into
the
streets
taking
possession
of
the
city
and
contributing
to
the
melancholy
wretchedness
of
such
of
the
inhabitants
as
had
to
be
out
of
doors
through
this
smoke
the
red
sun
when
visible
had
dragged
his
downward
course
in
manifest
discouragement
and
the
hastening
twilight
soon
gave
place
to
the
blackness
of
darkness
night
reigned
supreme
thirty
years
ago
electric
lighting
was
not
in
vogue
and
the
system
of
street
lamps
was
far
less
complete
than
at
present
although
the
gas
burned
in
them
may
not
have
been
any
worse
the
lamps
were
much
fewer
and
farther
between
and
the
light
which
they
emitted
had
a
feeble
sickly
aspect
and
did
not
reach
any
distance
into
the
moist
and
murky
atmosphere
and
so
the
night
was
dismal
enough
and
the
few
people
upon
the
street
were
visible
only
as
they
passed
directly
beneath
the
lamps
or
in
front
of
lighted
windows
seeming
at
other
times
like
moving
shadows
against
a
black
ground
as
i
am
like
to
be
conspicuous
in
these
pages
it
may
be
proper
to
say
that
i
am
very
susceptible
to
atmospheric
influences
i
figure
among
my
friends
as
a
man
of
quiet
disposition
but
i
am
at
times
morose
although
i
endeavor
to
conceal
this
fact
from
others
my
nervous
system
is
a
sensitive
sometimes
i
fancy
that
i
must
have
been
born
under
the
planet
saturn
for
i
find
myself
unpleasantly
influenced
by
moods
ascribed
to
that
depressing
planet
more
especially
in
its
disagreeable
phases
for
i
regret
to
state
that
i
do
not
find
corresponding
elation
as
i
should
in
its
brighter
aspects
i
have
an
especial
dislike
for
wintry
weather
a
dislike
which
i
find
growing
with
my
years
until
it
has
developed
almost
into
positive
antipathy
and
dread
on
the
day
i
have
described
my
moods
had
varied
with
the
weather
the
fitfulness
of
the
winds
had
found
its
way
into
my
feelings
and
the
somber
tone
of
the
clouds
into
my
meditations
i
was
restless
as
the
elements
and
a
deep
sense
of
dissatisfaction
with
myself
and
everything
else
possessed
me
i
could
not
content
myself
in
any
place
or
position
reading
was
distasteful
writing
equally
so
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
a
brisk
walk
for
a
few
blocks
might
afford
relief
muffling
myself
up
in
my
overcoat
and
fur
cap
i
took
the
street
only
to
find
the
air
gusty
and
raw
and
i
gave
up
in
still
greater
disgust
and
returning
home
after
drawing
the
curtains
and
locking
the
doors
planted
myself
in
front
of
a
glowing
grate
fire
firmly
resolved
to
rid
myself
of
myself
by
resorting
to
the
oblivion
of
thought
reverie
or
dream
to
sleep
was
impossible
and
i
sat
moodily
in
an
easy
chair
noting
the
quarter
and
strokes
as
they
were
chimed
out
sweetly
from
the
spire
of
peter
cathedral
a
few
blocks
away
nine
passed
with
its
song
of
home
sweet
home
ten
and
then
eleven
strokes
of
the
ponderous
bell
which
noted
the
hours
roused
me
to
a
strenuous
effort
to
shake
off
the
feelings
of
despondency
unrest
and
turbulence
that
all
combined
to
produce
a
state
of
mental
and
physical
misery
now
insufferable
rising
suddenly
from
my
chair
without
a
conscious
effort
i
walked
mechanically
to
a
seized
a
volume
at
random
reseated
myself
before
the
fire
and
opened
the
book
it
proved
to
be
an
odd
neglected
volume
dictionary
of
latin
quotations
at
the
moment
there
flashed
upon
me
a
conscious
duality
of
existence
had
the
old
book
some
mesmeric
power
i
seemed
to
myself
two
persons
and
i
quickly
said
aloud
as
if
addressing
my
double
if
i
can
not
quiet
you
turbulent
spirit
i
can
at
least
adapt
myself
to
your
condition
i
will
read
this
book
haphazard
from
bottom
to
top
or
backward
if
necessary
and
if
this
does
not
change
the
subject
often
enough
i
will
try
noah
webster
opening
the
book
mechanically
at
page
i
glanced
at
the
bottom
line
and
read
nunquam
minus
solus
quam
cum
solus
never
less
alone
than
when
alone
these
words
arrested
my
thoughts
at
once
as
by
a
singular
chance
they
seemed
to
fit
my
mood
was
it
or
was
it
not
some
conscious
invisible
intelligence
that
caused
me
to
select
that
page
and
brought
the
apothegm
to
my
notice
again
like
a
flash
came
the
consciousness
of
duality
and
i
began
to
argue
with
my
other
self
this
is
arrant
nonsense
i
cried
aloud
even
though
cicero
did
say
it
and
it
is
on
a
par
with
many
other
delusive
maxims
that
have
for
so
many
years
embittered
the
existence
of
our
modern
youth
by
misleading
thought
do
you
know
cicero
that
this
statement
is
not
sound
that
it
is
unworthy
the
position
you
occupy
in
history
as
a
thinker
and
philosopher
that
it
is
a
contradiction
in
itself
for
if
a
man
is
alone
he
is
alone
and
that
settles
it
i
mused
in
this
vein
a
few
moments
and
then
resumed
aloud
it
do
it
wo
do
if
one
is
alone
the
word
is
absolute
he
is
single
isolated
in
short
alone
and
there
can
by
no
manner
of
possibility
be
any
one
else
present
take
myself
for
instance
i
am
the
sole
occupant
of
this
apartment
i
am
alone
and
yet
you
say
in
so
many
words
that
i
was
never
less
alone
than
at
this
instant
it
was
not
without
some
misgiving
that
i
uttered
these
words
for
the
strange
consciousness
of
my
own
duality
constantly
grew
stronger
and
i
could
not
shake
off
the
reflection
that
even
now
there
were
two
of
myself
in
the
room
and
that
i
was
not
so
much
alone
as
i
endeavored
to
convince
myself
this
feeling
oppressed
me
like
an
incubus
i
must
throw
it
off
and
rising
i
tossed
the
book
upon
the
table
exclaiming
what
folly
i
am
alone
positively
there
is
no
other
living
thing
visible
or
invisible
in
the
room
i
hesitated
as
i
spoke
for
the
strange
undefined
sensation
that
i
was
not
alone
had
become
almost
a
conviction
but
the
sound
of
my
voice
encouraged
me
and
i
determined
to
discuss
the
subject
and
i
remarked
in
a
full
strong
voice
i
am
surely
alone
i
know
i
am
why
i
will
wager
everything
i
possess
even
to
my
soul
that
i
am
alone
i
stood
facing
the
smoldering
embers
of
the
fire
which
i
had
neglected
to
replenish
uttering
these
words
to
settle
the
controversy
for
good
and
all
with
one
person
of
my
dual
self
but
the
other
ego
seemed
to
dissent
violently
when
a
soft
clear
voice
claimed
my
ear
you
have
lost
your
wager
you
are
not
alone
illustration
and
to
my
amazement
saw
a
man
i
turned
instantly
towards
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
to
my
amazement
saw
a
man
seated
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
gazing
at
me
with
the
utmost
composure
i
am
not
a
coward
nor
a
believer
in
ghosts
or
illusions
and
yet
that
sight
froze
me
where
i
stood
it
had
no
supernatural
appearance
on
the
contrary
was
a
plain
ordinary
man
but
the
weather
the
experiences
of
the
day
the
weird
inclement
night
had
all
conspired
to
strain
my
nerves
to
the
highest
point
of
tension
and
i
trembled
from
head
to
foot
noting
this
the
stranger
said
pleasantly
quiet
yourself
my
dear
sir
you
have
nothing
to
fear
be
seated
i
obeyed
mechanically
and
regaining
in
a
few
moments
some
semblance
of
composure
took
a
mental
inventory
of
my
visitor
who
is
he
what
is
he
how
did
he
enter
without
my
notice
and
why
what
is
his
business
were
all
questions
that
flashed
into
my
mind
in
quick
succession
and
quickly
flashed
out
unanswered
the
stranger
sat
eying
me
composedly
even
pleasantly
as
if
waiting
for
me
to
reach
some
conclusion
regarding
himself
at
last
i
surmised
he
is
a
maniac
who
has
found
his
way
here
by
methods
peculiar
to
the
insane
and
my
personal
safety
demands
that
i
use
him
discreetly
very
good
he
remarked
as
though
reading
my
thoughts
as
well
think
that
as
anything
else
but
why
are
you
here
what
is
your
business
i
asked
you
have
made
and
lost
a
wager
he
said
you
have
committed
an
act
of
folly
in
making
positive
statements
regarding
a
matter
about
which
you
know
nothing
a
very
common
failing
by
the
way
on
the
part
of
mankind
and
concerning
which
i
wish
first
to
set
you
straight
the
ironical
coolness
with
which
he
said
this
provoked
me
and
i
hastily
rejoined
you
are
impertinent
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
my
house
at
once
very
well
he
answered
but
if
you
insist
upon
this
i
shall
on
behalf
of
cicero
claim
the
stake
of
your
voluntary
wager
which
means
that
i
must
first
by
natural
though
violent
means
release
your
soul
from
your
body
so
saying
he
arose
drew
from
an
inner
pocket
a
long
keen
knife
the
blade
of
which
quiveringly
glistened
as
he
laid
it
upon
the
table
moving
his
chair
so
as
to
be
within
easy
reach
of
the
gleaming
weapon
he
sat
down
and
again
regarded
me
with
the
same
quiet
composure
i
had
noted
and
which
was
fast
dispelling
my
first
impression
concerning
his
sanity
i
was
not
prepared
for
his
strange
action
in
truth
i
was
not
prepared
for
anything
my
mind
was
confused
concerning
the
whole
night
doings
and
i
was
unable
to
reason
clearly
or
consecutively
or
even
to
satisfy
myself
what
i
did
think
if
indeed
i
thought
at
all
the
sensation
of
fear
however
was
fast
leaving
me
there
was
something
reassuring
in
my
unbidden
guest
perfect
ease
of
manner
and
the
mild
though
searching
gaze
of
his
eyes
which
were
wonderful
in
their
expression
i
began
to
observe
his
personal
characteristics
which
impressed
me
favorably
and
yet
were
extraordinary
he
was
nearly
six
feet
tall
and
perfectly
straight
well
proportioned
with
no
tendency
either
to
leanness
or
obesity
but
his
head
was
an
object
from
which
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
such
a
head
surely
i
had
never
before
seen
on
mortal
shoulders
the
chin
as
seen
through
his
silver
beard
was
rounded
and
well
developed
the
mouth
straight
with
pleasant
lines
about
it
the
jaws
square
and
like
the
mouth
indicating
decision
the
eyes
deep
set
and
arched
with
heavy
eyebrows
and
the
whole
surmounted
by
a
forehead
so
vast
so
high
that
it
was
almost
a
deformity
and
yet
it
did
not
impress
me
unpleasantly
it
was
the
forehead
of
a
scholar
a
profound
thinker
a
deep
student
the
nose
was
inclined
to
aquiline
and
quite
large
the
contour
of
the
head
and
face
impressed
me
as
indicating
a
man
of
learning
one
who
had
given
a
lifetime
to
experimental
as
well
as
speculative
thought
his
voice
was
mellow
clear
and
distinct
always
pleasantly
modulated
and
soft
never
loud
nor
unpleasant
in
the
least
degree
one
remarkable
feature
i
must
not
fail
to
mention
his
hair
this
while
thin
and
scant
upon
the
top
of
his
head
was
long
and
reached
to
his
shoulders
his
beard
was
of
unusual
length
descending
almost
to
his
waist
his
hair
eyebrows
and
beard
were
all
of
singular
whiteness
and
purity
almost
transparent
a
silvery
whiteness
that
seemed
an
aureolar
sheen
in
the
glare
of
the
gaslight
what
struck
me
as
particularly
remarkable
was
that
his
skin
looked
as
soft
and
smooth
as
that
of
a
child
there
was
not
a
blemish
in
it
his
age
was
a
puzzle
none
could
guess
stripped
of
his
hair
or
the
color
of
it
changed
he
might
be
given
a
few
wrinkles
he
might
be
ninety
taken
altogether
i
had
never
seen
his
like
nor
anything
approaching
his
like
and
for
an
instant
there
was
a
faint
suggestion
to
my
mind
that
he
was
not
of
this
earth
but
belonged
to
some
other
planet
i
now
fancy
he
must
have
read
my
impressions
of
him
as
these
ideas
shaped
themselves
in
my
brain
and
that
he
was
quietly
waiting
for
me
to
regain
a
degree
of
that
would
allow
him
to
disclose
the
purpose
of
his
visit
he
was
first
to
break
the
silence
i
see
that
you
are
not
disposed
to
pay
your
wager
any
more
than
i
am
to
collect
it
so
we
will
not
discuss
that
i
admit
that
my
introduction
was
abrupt
but
you
can
not
deny
that
you
challenged
me
to
appear
i
was
not
clear
upon
the
point
and
said
so
your
memory
is
at
fault
he
continued
if
you
can
not
recall
your
experiences
of
the
day
just
past
did
you
not
attempt
to
interest
yourself
in
modern
book
lore
to
fix
your
mind
in
turn
upon
history
chemistry
botany
poetry
and
general
literature
and
all
these
failing
did
you
not
deliberately
challenge
cicero
to
a
practical
demonstration
of
an
old
apothegm
of
his
that
has
survived
for
centuries
and
of
your
own
free
will
did
not
you
make
a
wager
that
as
an
admirer
of
cicero
i
am
free
to
accept
to
all
this
i
could
but
silently
assent
very
good
then
we
will
not
pursue
this
subject
further
as
it
is
not
relevant
to
my
purpose
which
is
to
acquaint
you
with
a
narrative
of
unusual
interest
upon
certain
conditions
with
which
if
you
comply
you
will
not
only
serve
yourself
but
me
as
well
please
name
the
conditions
i
said
they
are
simple
enough
he
answered
the
narrative
i
speak
of
is
in
manuscript
i
will
produce
it
in
the
near
future
and
my
design
is
to
read
it
aloud
to
you
or
to
allow
you
to
read
it
to
me
as
you
may
select
further
my
wish
is
that
during
the
reading
you
shall
interpose
any
objection
or
question
that
you
deem
proper
this
reading
will
occupy
many
evenings
and
i
shall
of
necessity
be
with
you
often
when
the
reading
is
concluded
we
will
seal
the
package
securely
and
i
shall
leave
you
forever
you
will
then
deposit
the
manuscript
in
some
safe
place
and
let
it
remain
for
thirty
years
when
this
period
has
elapsed
i
wish
you
to
publish
this
history
to
the
world
your
conditions
seem
easy
i
said
after
a
few
seconds
pause
they
are
certainly
very
simple
do
you
accept
i
hesitated
for
the
prospect
of
giving
myself
up
to
a
succession
of
interviews
with
this
extraordinary
and
mysterious
personage
seemed
to
require
consideration
he
evidently
divined
my
thoughts
for
rising
from
his
chair
he
said
abruptly
let
me
have
your
answer
now
i
debated
the
matter
no
further
but
answered
i
accept
conditionally
name
your
conditions
the
guest
replied
i
will
either
publish
the
work
or
induce
some
other
man
to
do
so
illustration
let
me
have
your
answer
now
good
he
said
i
will
see
you
again
with
a
polite
bow
and
turning
to
the
door
which
i
had
previously
locked
he
opened
it
softly
and
with
a
quiet
good
night
disappeared
in
the
i
looked
after
him
with
bewildered
senses
but
a
sudden
impulse
caused
me
to
glance
toward
the
table
when
i
saw
that
he
had
forgotten
his
knife
with
the
view
of
returning
this
i
reached
to
pick
it
up
but
my
finger
tips
no
sooner
touched
the
handle
than
a
sudden
chill
shivered
along
my
nerves
not
as
an
electric
shock
but
rather
as
a
sensation
of
extreme
cold
was
the
current
that
ran
through
me
in
an
instant
rushing
into
the
to
the
landing
of
the
stairs
i
called
after
the
mysterious
being
you
have
forgotten
your
knife
but
beyond
the
faint
echo
of
my
voice
i
heard
no
sound
the
phantom
was
gone
a
moment
later
i
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
had
thrown
open
the
door
a
street
lamp
shed
an
uncertain
light
in
front
of
the
house
i
stepped
out
and
listened
intently
for
a
moment
but
not
a
sound
was
audible
if
indeed
i
except
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
which
throbbed
so
wildly
that
i
fancied
i
heard
it
no
footfall
echoed
from
the
deserted
streets
all
was
silent
as
a
churchyard
and
i
closed
and
locked
the
door
softly
tiptoed
my
way
back
to
my
room
and
sank
collapsed
into
an
easy
chair
i
was
more
than
exhausted
i
quivered
from
head
to
foot
not
with
cold
but
with
a
strange
nervous
chill
that
found
intensest
expression
in
my
spinal
column
and
seemed
to
flash
up
and
down
my
back
vibrating
like
a
feverous
pulse
this
active
pain
was
succeeded
by
a
feeling
of
frozen
numbness
and
i
sat
i
know
not
how
long
trying
to
tranquilize
myself
and
think
temperately
of
the
night
occurrence
by
degrees
i
recovered
my
normal
sensations
and
directing
my
will
in
the
channel
of
sober
reasoning
i
said
to
myself
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
his
visit
for
his
knife
is
here
as
a
witness
to
the
fact
so
much
is
sure
and
i
will
secure
that
testimony
at
all
events
with
this
reflection
i
turned
to
the
table
but
to
my
astonishment
i
discovered
that
the
knife
had
disappeared
it
needed
but
this
miracle
to
start
the
perspiration
in
great
cold
beads
from
every
pore
my
brain
was
in
a
whirl
and
reeling
into
a
chair
i
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
how
long
i
sat
in
this
posture
i
do
not
remember
i
only
know
that
i
began
to
doubt
my
own
sanity
and
wondered
if
this
were
not
the
way
people
became
deranged
had
not
my
peculiar
habits
of
isolation
irregular
and
intense
study
erratic
living
all
conspired
to
unseat
reason
surely
here
was
every
ground
to
believe
so
and
yet
i
was
able
still
to
think
consistently
and
hold
steadily
to
a
single
line
of
thought
insane
people
can
not
do
that
i
reflected
and
gradually
the
tremor
and
excitement
wore
away
when
i
had
become
calmer
and
more
collected
and
my
sober
judgment
said
go
to
bed
sleep
just
as
long
as
you
can
hold
your
eyelids
down
and
when
you
awake
refreshed
as
you
will
think
out
the
whole
subject
at
your
leisure
i
arose
threw
open
the
shutters
and
found
that
day
was
breaking
hastily
undressing
i
went
to
bed
and
closed
my
eyes
vaguely
conscious
of
some
soothing
guardianship
perhaps
because
i
was
physically
exhausted
i
soon
lost
myself
in
the
oblivion
of
sleep
illustration
i
espied
upon
the
table
a
long
white
hair
i
did
not
dream
at
least
i
could
not
afterwards
remember
my
dream
if
i
had
one
but
i
recollect
thinking
that
somebody
struck
ten
distinct
blows
on
my
door
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
of
metal
and
very
sonorous
these
ten
blows
in
my
state
i
counted
i
lay
very
quiet
for
a
time
collecting
my
thoughts
and
noting
various
objects
about
the
room
until
my
eye
caught
the
dial
of
a
french
clock
upon
the
mantel
it
was
a
few
minutes
past
ten
and
the
blows
i
had
heard
were
the
strokes
of
the
hammer
upon
the
gong
in
the
clock
the
sun
was
shining
into
the
room
which
was
quite
cold
for
the
fire
had
gone
out
i
arose
dressed
myself
quickly
and
after
thoroughly
laving
my
face
and
hands
in
water
felt
considerably
refreshed
before
going
out
to
breakfast
while
looking
around
the
room
for
a
few
things
which
i
wanted
to
take
with
me
i
espied
upon
the
table
a
long
white
hair
this
was
indeed
a
surprise
for
i
had
about
concluded
that
my
adventure
of
the
previous
night
was
a
species
of
waking
nightmare
the
result
of
overworked
brain
and
weakened
body
but
here
was
tangible
evidence
to
the
contrary
an
assurance
that
my
mysterious
visitor
was
not
a
fancy
or
a
dream
and
his
parting
words
i
will
see
you
again
recurred
to
me
with
singular
effect
he
will
see
me
again
very
well
i
will
preserve
this
evidence
of
his
visit
for
future
use
i
wound
the
delicate
filament
into
a
little
coil
folded
it
carefully
in
a
bit
of
paper
and
consigned
it
to
a
corner
in
my
though
not
without
some
misgiving
that
it
too
might
disappear
as
did
the
knife
the
strange
experience
of
that
night
had
a
good
effect
on
me
i
became
more
regular
in
all
my
habits
took
abundant
sleep
and
exercise
was
more
methodical
in
my
modes
of
study
and
reasoning
and
in
a
short
time
found
myself
vastly
improved
in
every
way
mentally
and
physically
the
days
went
fleeting
into
weeks
the
weeks
into
months
and
while
the
form
and
figure
of
the
stranger
were
seldom
absent
from
my
mind
he
came
no
more
chapter
ii
a
friendly
conference
it
is
rare
in
our
present
civilization
to
find
a
man
who
lives
alone
this
remark
does
not
apply
to
hermits
or
persons
of
abnormal
or
perverted
mental
tendencies
but
to
the
majority
of
mankind
living
and
moving
actively
among
their
fellows
and
engaged
in
the
ordinary
occupations
of
humanity
every
man
must
have
at
least
one
confidant
either
of
his
own
household
or
within
the
circle
of
his
intimate
friends
there
may
possibly
be
rare
exceptions
among
persons
of
genius
in
statecraft
war
or
commerce
but
it
is
doubtful
even
in
such
instances
if
any
keep
all
their
thoughts
to
themselves
hermetically
sealed
from
their
fellows
as
a
prevailing
rule
either
a
loving
wife
or
very
near
friend
shares
the
inner
thought
of
the
most
secretive
individual
even
when
secrecy
seems
an
indispensable
element
to
success
the
tendency
to
a
free
interchange
of
ideas
and
experiences
is
almost
universal
instinct
prompting
the
natural
man
to
unburden
his
most
sacred
thought
when
the
proper
confidant
and
the
proper
time
come
for
the
disclosure
for
months
i
kept
to
myself
the
events
narrated
in
the
preceding
chapter
and
this
for
several
reasons
first
the
dread
of
ridicule
that
would
follow
the
relation
of
the
fantastic
occurrences
and
the
possible
suspicion
of
my
sanity
that
might
result
from
the
recital
second
very
grave
doubts
as
to
the
reality
of
my
experiences
but
by
degrees
was
restored
as
i
reasoned
the
matter
over
and
reassured
myself
by
occasional
contemplation
of
the
silvery
hair
i
had
coiled
in
my
and
which
at
first
i
had
expected
would
vanish
as
did
the
stranger
knife
there
came
upon
me
a
feeling
that
i
should
see
my
weird
visitor
again
and
at
an
early
day
i
resisted
this
impression
for
it
was
a
feeling
of
the
idea
rather
than
a
thought
but
the
vague
expectation
grew
upon
me
in
spite
of
myself
until
at
length
it
became
a
conviction
which
no
argument
or
logic
could
shake
curiously
enough
as
the
original
incident
receded
into
the
past
this
new
idea
thrust
itself
into
the
foreground
and
i
began
in
my
own
mind
to
court
another
interview
at
times
sitting
alone
after
night
i
felt
that
i
was
watched
by
unseen
eyes
these
eyes
haunted
me
in
my
solitude
and
i
was
morally
sure
of
the
presence
of
another
than
myself
in
the
room
the
sensation
was
at
first
unpleasant
and
i
tried
to
throw
it
off
with
partial
success
but
only
for
a
little
while
could
i
banish
the
intrusive
idea
and
as
the
thought
took
form
and
the
invisible
presence
became
more
actual
to
consciousness
i
hoped
that
the
stranger
would
make
good
his
parting
promise
i
will
see
you
again
on
one
thing
i
was
resolved
i
would
at
least
be
better
informed
on
the
subject
of
hallucinations
and
apparitions
and
not
be
taken
unawares
as
i
had
been
to
this
end
i
decided
to
confer
with
my
friend
professor
chickering
a
quiet
thoughtful
man
of
varied
accomplishments
and
thoroughly
read
upon
a
great
number
of
topics
especially
in
the
literature
of
the
marvelous
so
to
the
professor
i
went
after
due
appointment
and
confided
to
him
full
particulars
of
my
adventure
he
listened
patiently
throughout
and
when
i
had
finished
assured
me
in
a
way
that
such
hallucinations
were
by
no
means
rare
his
remark
was
provoking
for
i
did
not
expect
from
the
patient
interest
he
had
shown
while
i
was
telling
my
story
that
the
whole
matter
would
be
dismissed
thus
summarily
i
said
with
some
warmth
but
this
was
not
a
hallucination
i
tried
at
first
to
persuade
myself
that
it
was
illusory
but
the
more
i
have
thought
the
experience
over
the
more
real
it
becomes
to
me
perhaps
you
were
dreaming
suggested
the
professor
no
i
answered
i
have
tried
that
hypothesis
and
it
will
not
do
many
things
make
that
view
untenable
do
not
be
too
sure
of
that
he
said
you
were
by
your
own
account
in
a
highly
nervous
condition
and
physically
tired
it
is
possible
perhaps
probable
that
in
this
state
as
you
sat
in
your
chair
you
dozed
off
for
a
short
interval
during
which
the
illusion
flashed
through
your
mind
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
incidents
occupying
a
large
portion
of
the
night
occurred
in
an
interval
which
you
describe
as
a
flash
easily
enough
in
dreams
time
may
not
exist
periods
embracing
weeks
or
months
may
be
reduced
to
an
instant
long
journeys
hours
of
conversation
or
a
multitude
of
transactions
may
be
compressed
into
a
term
measured
by
the
opening
or
closing
of
a
door
or
the
striking
of
a
clock
in
dreams
ordinary
standards
of
reason
find
no
place
while
ideas
or
events
chase
through
the
mind
more
rapidly
than
thought
conceding
all
this
why
did
i
considering
the
unusual
character
of
the
incidents
accept
them
as
real
as
substantial
as
natural
as
the
most
commonplace
events
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
in
that
he
replied
in
dreams
all
sorts
of
absurdities
impossibilities
discordancies
and
violation
of
natural
law
appear
realities
without
exciting
the
least
surprise
or
suspicion
imagination
runs
riot
and
is
supreme
and
reason
for
the
time
is
dormant
we
see
ghosts
spirits
the
forms
of
persons
dead
or
living
we
suffer
pain
pleasure
hunger
and
all
sensations
and
emotions
without
a
moment
question
of
their
reality
do
any
of
the
subjects
of
our
dreams
or
visions
leave
tangible
evidences
of
their
presence
assuredly
not
he
answered
with
an
incredulous
gesture
the
idea
is
absurd
then
i
was
not
dreaming
i
mused
without
looking
at
me
the
professor
went
on
these
false
presentiments
may
have
their
origin
in
other
ways
as
from
mental
disorders
caused
by
indigestion
nicolai
a
noted
bookseller
of
berlin
was
thus
afflicted
his
experiences
are
interesting
and
possibly
suggestive
let
me
read
some
of
them
to
you
the
professor
hereupon
glanced
over
his
bookshelf
selected
a
volume
and
proceeded
to
read
this
work
i
have
found
to
be
vol
iv
of
chambers
miscellany
published
by
gould
and
lincoln
j
i
generally
saw
human
forms
of
both
sexes
but
they
usually
seemed
not
to
take
the
smallest
notice
of
each
other
moving
as
in
a
market
place
where
all
are
eager
to
press
through
the
crowd
at
times
however
they
seemed
to
be
transacting
business
with
each
other
i
also
saw
several
times
people
on
horseback
dogs
and
birds
all
these
phantasms
appeared
to
me
in
their
natural
size
and
as
distinct
as
if
alive
exhibiting
different
shades
of
carnation
in
the
uncovered
parts
as
well
as
different
colors
and
fashions
in
their
dresses
though
the
colors
seemed
somewhat
paler
than
in
real
nature
none
of
the
figures
appeared
particularly
terrible
comical
or
disgusting
most
of
them
being
of
indifferent
shape
and
some
presenting
a
pleasant
aspect
the
longer
these
phantasms
continued
to
visit
me
the
more
frequently
did
they
return
while
at
the
same
time
they
increased
in
number
about
four
weeks
after
they
had
first
appeared
i
also
began
to
hear
them
talk
these
phantoms
conversed
among
themselves
but
more
frequently
addressed
their
discourse
to
me
their
speeches
were
uncommonly
short
and
never
of
an
unpleasant
turn
at
different
times
there
appeared
to
me
both
dear
and
sensible
friends
of
both
sexes
whose
addresses
tended
to
appease
my
grief
which
had
not
yet
wholly
subsided
their
consolatory
speeches
were
in
general
addressed
to
me
when
i
was
alone
sometimes
however
i
was
accosted
by
these
consoling
friends
while
i
was
engaged
in
company
and
not
unfrequently
while
real
persons
were
speaking
to
me
these
consolatory
addresses
consisted
sometimes
of
abrupt
phrases
and
at
other
times
they
were
regularly
executed
here
i
interrupted
i
note
professor
that
nicolai
knew
these
forms
to
be
illusions
without
answering
my
remark
he
continued
to
read
there
is
in
imagination
a
potency
far
exceeding
the
fabled
power
of
aladdin
lamp
how
often
does
one
sit
in
wintry
evening
musings
and
trace
in
the
glowing
embers
the
features
of
an
absent
friend
imagination
with
its
magic
wand
will
there
build
a
city
with
its
countless
spires
or
marshal
contending
armies
or
drive
the
ship
upon
the
ocean
the
following
story
related
by
scott
affords
a
good
illustration
of
this
principle
long
after
the
death
of
an
illustrious
poet
who
had
filled
while
living
a
great
station
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
a
literary
friend
to
whom
the
deceased
had
been
well
known
was
engaged
during
the
darkening
twilight
of
an
autumn
evening
in
perusing
one
of
the
publications
which
professed
to
detail
the
habits
and
opinions
of
the
distinguished
individual
who
was
now
no
more
as
the
reader
had
enjoyed
the
intimacy
of
the
deceased
to
a
considerable
degree
he
was
deeply
interested
in
the
publication
which
contained
some
particulars
relating
to
himself
and
other
friends
a
visitor
was
sitting
in
the
apartment
who
was
also
engaged
in
reading
their
opened
into
an
entrance
hall
rather
fantastically
fitted
up
with
articles
of
armor
skins
of
wild
animals
and
the
like
it
was
when
laying
down
his
book
and
passing
into
this
hall
through
which
the
moon
was
beginning
to
shine
that
the
individual
of
whom
i
speak
saw
right
before
him
in
a
standing
posture
the
exact
representation
of
his
departed
friend
whose
recollection
had
been
so
strongly
brought
to
his
imagination
he
stopped
for
a
single
moment
so
as
to
notice
the
wonderful
accuracy
with
which
fancy
had
impressed
upon
the
bodily
eye
the
peculiarities
of
dress
and
position
of
the
illustrious
poet
sensible
however
of
the
delusion
he
felt
no
sentiment
save
that
of
wonder
at
the
extraordinary
accuracy
of
the
resemblance
and
stepped
onward
to
the
figure
which
resolved
itself
as
he
approached
into
the
various
materials
of
which
it
was
composed
these
were
merely
a
screen
occupied
by
great
coats
shawls
plaids
and
such
other
articles
as
are
usually
found
in
a
country
entrance
hall
the
spectator
returned
to
the
spot
from
which
he
had
seen
the
illusion
and
endeavored
with
all
his
power
to
recall
the
image
which
had
been
so
singularly
vivid
but
this
he
was
unable
to
do
and
the
person
who
had
witnessed
the
apparition
or
more
properly
whose
excited
state
had
been
the
means
of
raising
it
had
only
to
return
to
the
apartment
and
tell
his
young
friend
under
what
a
striking
hallucination
he
had
for
a
moment
labored
here
i
was
constrained
to
call
the
professor
to
a
halt
your
stories
are
very
interesting
i
said
but
i
fail
to
perceive
any
analogy
in
either
the
conditions
or
the
incidents
to
my
experience
i
was
fully
awake
and
conscious
at
the
time
and
the
man
i
saw
appeared
and
moved
about
in
the
full
glare
of
the
gaslight
perhaps
not
he
answered
i
am
simply
giving
you
some
general
illustrations
of
the
subject
but
here
is
a
case
more
to
the
point
again
he
read
a
lady
was
once
passing
through
a
wood
in
the
darkening
twilight
of
a
stormy
evening
to
visit
a
friend
who
was
watching
over
a
dying
child
the
clouds
were
thick
the
rain
beginning
to
fall
darkness
was
increasing
the
wind
was
moaning
mournfully
through
the
trees
the
lady
heart
almost
failed
her
as
she
saw
that
she
had
a
mile
to
walk
through
the
woods
in
the
gathering
gloom
but
the
reflection
of
the
situation
of
her
friend
forbade
her
turning
back
excited
and
trembling
she
called
to
her
aid
a
nervous
resolution
and
pressed
onward
she
had
not
proceeded
far
when
she
beheld
in
the
path
before
her
the
movement
of
some
very
indistinct
object
it
appeared
to
keep
a
little
distance
ahead
of
her
and
as
she
made
efforts
to
get
nearer
to
see
what
it
was
it
seemed
proportionally
to
recede
the
lady
began
to
feel
rather
unpleasantly
there
was
some
pale
white
object
certainly
discernible
before
her
and
it
appeared
mysteriously
to
float
along
at
a
regular
distance
without
any
effort
at
motion
notwithstanding
the
lady
good
sense
and
unusual
resolution
a
cold
chill
began
to
come
over
her
she
made
every
effort
to
resist
her
fears
and
soon
succeeded
in
drawing
nearer
the
mysterious
object
when
she
was
appalled
at
beholding
the
features
of
her
friend
child
cold
in
death
wrapt
in
its
shroud
she
gazed
earnestly
and
there
it
remained
distinct
and
clear
before
her
eyes
she
considered
it
a
premonition
that
her
friend
child
was
dead
and
that
she
must
hasten
to
her
aid
but
there
was
the
apparition
directly
in
her
path
she
must
pass
it
taking
up
a
little
stick
she
forced
herself
along
to
the
object
and
behold
some
little
animal
scampered
away
it
was
this
that
her
excited
imagination
had
transformed
into
the
corpse
of
an
infant
in
its
winding
sheet
i
was
a
little
irritated
and
once
more
interrupted
the
reader
warmly
this
is
exasperating
now
what
resemblance
is
there
between
the
vagaries
of
a
hysterical
woman
and
my
case
he
smiled
and
again
read
the
numerous
stories
told
of
ghosts
or
the
spirits
of
persons
who
are
dead
will
in
most
instances
be
found
to
have
originated
in
diseased
imagination
aggravated
by
some
abnormal
defect
of
mind
we
may
mention
a
remarkable
case
in
point
and
one
which
is
not
mentioned
in
english
works
on
this
subject
it
is
told
by
a
compiler
of
les
causes
célèbres
two
young
noblemen
the
marquises
de
rambouillet
and
de
precy
belonging
to
two
of
the
first
families
of
france
made
an
agreement
in
the
warmth
of
their
friendship
that
the
one
who
died
first
should
return
to
the
other
with
tidings
of
the
world
to
come
soon
afterwards
de
rambouillet
went
to
the
wars
in
flanders
while
de
precy
remained
at
paris
stricken
by
a
fever
lying
alone
in
bed
and
severely
ill
de
precy
one
day
heard
a
rustling
of
his
bed
curtains
and
turning
round
saw
his
friend
de
rambouillet
in
full
military
attire
the
sick
man
sprung
over
the
bed
to
welcome
his
friend
but
the
other
receded
and
said
that
he
had
come
to
fulfill
his
promise
having
been
killed
on
that
very
day
he
further
said
that
it
behooved
de
precy
to
think
more
of
the
afterworld
as
all
that
was
said
of
it
was
true
and
as
he
himself
would
die
in
his
first
battle
de
precy
was
then
left
by
the
phantom
and
it
was
afterward
found
that
de
rambouillet
had
fallen
on
that
day
ah
i
said
and
so
the
phantom
predicted
an
event
that
followed
as
indicated
spiritual
illusions
explained
the
professor
are
not
unusual
and
well
authenticated
cases
are
not
wanting
in
which
they
have
been
induced
in
persons
of
intelligence
by
functional
or
organic
disorders
in
the
last
case
cited
the
prediction
was
followed
by
a
fulfillment
but
this
was
chance
or
mere
coincidence
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
in
the
multitude
of
dreams
that
come
to
humanity
some
few
should
not
be
followed
by
events
so
similar
as
to
warrant
the
belief
that
they
were
prefigured
but
here
is
an
illustration
that
fits
your
case
let
me
read
it
in
some
instances
it
may
be
difficult
to
decide
whether
spectral
appearances
and
spectral
noises
proceed
from
physical
derangement
or
from
an
overwrought
state
of
mind
want
of
exercise
and
amusement
may
also
be
a
prevailing
cause
a
friend
mentions
to
us
the
following
case
an
acquaintance
of
his
a
merchant
in
london
who
had
for
years
paid
very
close
attention
to
business
was
one
day
while
alone
in
his
counting
house
very
much
surprised
to
hear
as
he
imagined
persons
outside
the
door
talking
freely
about
him
thinking
it
was
some
acquaintances
who
were
playing
off
a
trick
he
opened
the
door
to
request
them
to
come
in
when
to
his
amazement
he
found
that
nobody
was
there
he
again
sat
down
to
his
desk
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
same
dialogue
recommenced
the
language
was
very
alarming
one
voice
seemed
to
say
have
the
scoundrel
in
his
own
counting
house
let
us
go
in
and
seize
him
replied
the
other
voice
is
right
to
take
him
he
has
been
guilty
of
a
great
crime
and
ought
to
be
brought
to
condign
punishment
alarmed
at
these
threats
the
bewildered
merchant
rushed
to
the
door
and
there
again
no
person
was
to
be
seen
he
now
locked
his
door
and
went
home
but
the
voices
as
he
thought
followed
him
through
the
crowd
and
he
arrived
at
his
house
in
a
most
unenviable
state
of
mind
inclined
to
ascribe
the
voices
to
derangement
in
mind
he
sent
for
a
medical
attendant
and
told
his
case
and
a
certain
kind
of
treatment
was
prescribed
this
however
failed
the
voices
menacing
him
with
punishment
for
purely
imaginary
crimes
continued
and
he
was
reduced
to
the
brink
of
despair
at
length
a
friend
prescribed
entire
relaxation
from
business
and
a
daily
game
of
cricket
which
to
his
great
relief
proved
an
effectual
remedy
the
exercise
banished
the
phantom
voices
and
they
were
no
more
heard
so
you
think
that
i
am
in
need
of
exercise
exactly
and
that
my
experience
was
illusory
the
result
of
vertigo
or
some
temporary
calenture
of
the
brain
to
be
plain
with
you
yes
but
i
asked
you
a
while
ago
if
specters
or
phantoms
ever
leave
tangible
evidence
of
their
presence
the
professor
eyes
dilated
in
interrogation
i
continued
well
this
one
did
after
i
had
followed
him
out
i
found
on
the
table
a
long
white
hair
which
i
still
have
and
producing
the
little
coil
from
my
i
handed
it
to
him
he
examined
it
curiously
eyed
me
furtively
and
handed
it
back
with
the
cautious
remark
i
think
you
had
better
commence
your
exercise
at
once
chapter
iii
a
second
interview
with
the
mysterious
visitor
it
is
not
pleasant
to
have
one
mental
responsibility
brought
in
question
and
the
result
of
my
interview
with
professor
chickering
was
to
put
it
mildly
unsatisfactory
not
that
he
had
exactly
questioned
my
sanity
but
it
was
all
too
evident
that
he
was
disposed
to
accept
my
statement
of
a
plain
occurrence
with
a
too
liberal
modicum
of
salt
i
say
occurrence
in
full
knowledge
of
the
truth
that
i
myself
had
at
first
regarded
the
whole
transaction
as
a
fantasia
or
flight
of
mind
the
result
of
extreme
nervous
tension
but
in
the
interval
succeeding
i
had
abundant
opportunity
to
correlate
my
thoughts
and
to
bring
some
sort
of
order
out
of
the
mental
and
physical
chaos
of
that
strange
eventful
night
true
the
preliminary
events
leading
up
to
it
were
extraordinary
the
dismal
weather
the
depression
of
body
and
spirit
under
which
i
labored
the
wild
whirl
of
thought
keeping
pace
with
the
elements
in
short
a
general
concatenation
of
events
that
seemed
to
be
ordered
especially
for
the
introduction
of
some
abnormal
visitor
the
night
would
indeed
have
been
incomplete
without
a
ghost
but
was
it
a
ghost
there
was
nothing
ghostly
about
my
visitor
except
the
manner
of
his
entrance
and
exit
in
other
respects
he
seemed
substantial
enough
he
was
in
his
manners
courteous
and
polished
as
a
chesterfield
learned
as
a
savant
in
his
conversation
human
in
his
thoughtful
regard
of
my
fears
and
misgivings
but
that
tremendous
forehead
with
its
crown
of
silver
hair
the
long
translucent
beard
of
pearly
whiteness
and
above
all
the
astounding
facility
with
which
he
read
my
hidden
thoughts
these
were
not
natural
the
professor
had
been
patient
with
me
i
had
a
right
to
expect
that
he
was
entertaining
to
the
extent
of
reading
such
excerpts
as
he
had
with
him
on
the
subject
of
hallucinations
and
their
supposed
causes
but
had
he
not
spoiled
all
by
assigning
me
at
last
to
a
place
with
the
questionable
unbalanced
characters
he
had
cited
i
thought
so
and
the
reflection
provoked
me
and
this
thought
grew
upon
me
until
i
came
to
regard
his
stories
and
attendant
theories
as
so
much
literary
trash
my
own
reflections
had
been
sober
and
deliberate
and
had
led
me
to
seek
a
rational
explanation
of
the
unusual
phenomena
i
had
gone
to
professor
chickering
for
a
certain
measure
of
sympathy
and
what
was
more
to
the
point
to
secure
his
suggestions
and
assistance
in
the
further
unraveling
of
a
profound
mystery
that
might
contain
a
secret
of
untold
use
to
humanity
repulsed
by
the
mode
in
which
my
confidence
had
been
received
i
decided
to
do
what
i
should
have
done
from
the
outset
to
keep
my
own
counsel
and
to
follow
alone
the
investigation
to
the
end
no
matter
what
the
result
might
be
i
could
not
forget
or
ignore
the
silver
hair
i
had
so
religiously
preserved
that
was
genuine
it
was
as
tangible
as
real
as
convincing
a
witness
as
would
have
been
the
entire
head
of
my
singular
visitant
whatever
might
be
his
nature
i
began
to
feel
at
ease
the
moment
my
course
was
decided
and
the
feeling
was
at
once
renewed
within
me
that
the
gray
head
would
come
again
and
by
degrees
that
expectation
ripened
into
a
desire
only
intensified
as
the
days
sped
by
the
weeks
passed
into
months
summer
came
and
went
autumn
was
fast
fading
but
the
mysterious
unknown
did
not
appear
a
curious
fancy
led
me
now
to
regard
him
as
my
friend
for
the
mixed
and
indefinite
feelings
i
felt
at
first
towards
him
had
almost
unaccountably
been
changed
to
those
of
sincere
regard
he
was
not
always
in
my
thoughts
for
i
had
abundant
occupation
at
all
times
to
keep
both
brain
and
hands
busy
but
there
were
few
evenings
in
which
i
did
not
just
before
retiring
give
myself
up
for
a
brief
period
to
quiet
communion
with
my
own
thoughts
and
i
must
confess
at
such
times
the
unknown
occupied
the
larger
share
of
attention
the
constant
contemplation
of
any
theme
begets
a
feeling
of
familiarity
or
acquaintance
with
the
same
and
if
that
subject
be
an
individual
as
in
the
present
instance
such
contemplation
lessens
the
liability
to
surprise
from
any
unexpected
development
in
fact
i
not
only
anticipated
a
visit
but
courted
it
the
old
latin
maxim
that
i
had
played
with
never
less
alone
than
when
alone
had
domiciled
itself
within
my
brain
as
a
permanent
lodger
a
conviction
a
feeling
rather
than
a
thought
defined
and
i
had
but
little
difficulty
in
associating
an
which
i
had
come
to
place
in
a
certain
position
for
my
expected
visitor
with
his
presence
indian
summer
had
passed
and
the
fall
was
nearly
gone
when
for
some
inexplicable
reason
the
number
seven
began
to
haunt
me
what
had
i
to
do
with
seven
or
seven
with
me
when
i
sat
down
at
night
this
persistent
number
mixed
itself
in
my
thoughts
to
my
intense
annoyance
bother
take
the
mystic
numeral
what
was
i
to
do
with
seven
i
found
myself
asking
this
question
audibly
one
evening
when
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
i
would
refer
to
the
date
of
my
friend
visit
i
kept
no
journal
but
reference
to
a
record
of
some
business
transactions
that
i
had
associated
with
that
event
showed
that
it
took
place
on
november
seventh
that
settled
the
importunate
seven
i
should
look
for
whomever
he
was
on
the
first
anniversary
of
his
visit
which
was
the
seventh
now
close
at
hand
the
instant
i
had
reached
this
conclusion
the
number
left
me
and
troubled
me
no
more
november
third
had
passed
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
had
come
when
a
stubborn
protesting
notion
entered
my
mind
that
i
was
yielding
to
a
superstitious
idea
and
that
it
was
time
to
control
my
vacillating
will
accordingly
on
this
day
i
sent
word
to
a
friend
that
if
agreeable
to
him
i
would
call
on
him
on
the
evening
of
the
seventh
for
a
short
social
chat
but
as
i
expected
to
be
engaged
until
later
than
usual
would
he
excuse
me
if
i
did
not
reach
his
apartments
until
ten
the
request
was
singular
but
as
i
was
now
accounted
somewhat
odd
it
excited
no
comment
and
the
answer
was
returned
requesting
me
to
come
the
seventh
of
november
came
at
last
i
was
nervous
during
the
day
which
seemed
to
drag
tediously
and
several
times
it
was
remarked
of
me
that
i
seemed
abstracted
and
ill
at
ease
but
i
held
my
peace
night
came
cold
and
clear
and
the
stars
shone
brighter
than
usual
i
thought
it
was
a
sharp
contrast
to
the
night
of
a
year
ago
i
took
an
early
supper
for
which
i
had
no
appetite
after
which
i
strolled
aimlessly
about
the
streets
revolving
how
i
should
put
in
the
time
till
ten
when
i
was
to
call
upon
my
friend
i
decided
to
go
to
the
theater
and
to
the
theater
i
went
the
play
was
spectacular
aladdin
or
the
wonderful
lamp
the
entertainment
to
me
was
a
flat
failure
for
i
was
busy
with
my
thoughts
and
it
was
not
long
until
my
thoughts
were
busy
with
me
and
i
found
myself
attempting
to
answer
a
series
of
questions
that
finally
became
embarrassing
why
did
you
make
an
appointment
for
ten
instead
of
eight
if
you
wished
to
keep
away
from
your
apartments
i
had
thought
of
that
before
it
was
stupid
to
a
degree
if
not
and
i
frankly
admitted
as
much
why
did
you
make
an
appointment
at
all
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
you
not
only
expected
a
visitor
but
were
anxious
to
meet
him
this
was
easily
answered
because
i
did
not
wish
to
yield
to
what
struck
me
as
superstition
but
do
you
expect
to
extend
your
call
until
morning
well
no
i
had
thought
or
arranged
to
do
so
well
then
what
is
to
prevent
your
expected
guest
from
awaiting
your
return
or
what
assurance
have
you
that
he
will
not
encounter
you
in
the
street
under
circumstances
that
will
provoke
or
at
the
least
embarrass
you
none
whatever
then
what
have
you
gained
by
your
stupid
perversity
nothing
beyond
the
assertion
of
my
own
individuality
why
not
go
home
and
receive
your
guest
in
becoming
style
no
i
would
not
do
that
i
had
started
on
this
course
and
i
would
persevere
in
it
i
would
be
consistent
and
so
i
persisted
at
least
until
nine
when
i
quit
the
theater
in
sullen
dejection
and
went
home
to
make
some
slight
preparation
for
my
evening
call
with
my
i
let
myself
into
the
front
door
of
the
apartment
house
wherein
i
lodged
walked
through
the
hall
up
the
and
paused
on
the
threshold
of
my
room
wondering
what
i
would
find
inside
opening
the
door
i
entered
leaving
it
open
behind
me
so
that
the
light
from
the
would
shine
into
the
room
which
was
dark
and
there
was
no
transom
above
the
door
the
grate
fire
had
caked
into
a
solid
mass
of
charred
bituminous
coal
which
shed
no
illumination
beyond
a
faint
red
glow
at
the
bottom
showing
that
it
was
barely
alive
and
no
more
i
struck
a
match
on
the
underside
of
the
mantel
shelf
and
as
i
lit
the
gas
i
heard
the
click
of
the
door
latch
i
turned
instantly
the
door
had
been
gently
closed
by
some
unknown
force
if
not
by
unseen
hands
for
there
was
no
breath
of
air
stirring
this
preternatural
interference
was
not
pleasant
for
i
had
hoped
in
the
event
of
another
visit
from
my
friend
if
friend
he
was
that
he
would
bring
no
uncanny
or
ghostly
manifestation
to
disturb
me
i
looked
at
the
clock
the
index
pointed
to
half
past
nine
i
glanced
about
the
room
it
was
orderly
everything
in
proper
position
even
to
the
that
i
had
been
wont
to
place
for
my
nondescript
visitor
it
was
time
to
be
going
so
i
turned
to
the
dressing
case
brushed
my
hair
put
on
a
clean
scarf
and
moved
towards
the
which
stood
in
a
little
alcove
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
my
deserted
me
as
i
did
so
for
there
in
the
that
a
moment
before
was
empty
sat
my
guest
of
a
year
ago
facing
me
with
placid
features
the
room
began
to
revolve
a
faint
sick
feeling
came
over
me
and
i
reeled
into
the
first
convenient
chair
and
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
this
depression
lasted
but
an
instant
however
and
as
i
recovered
i
felt
or
fancied
i
felt
a
pair
of
penetrating
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
the
same
mild
searching
gaze
i
remembered
so
well
i
ventured
to
look
up
sure
enough
there
they
were
the
beaming
eyes
and
there
was
he
rising
from
his
chair
he
towered
up
to
his
full
height
smiled
pleasantly
and
with
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
murmured
permit
me
to
wish
you
good
evening
i
am
profoundly
glad
to
meet
you
again
it
was
full
a
minute
before
i
could
muster
courage
to
answer
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
for
myself
and
why
should
you
he
said
gently
and
courteously
you
have
realized
for
the
past
six
months
that
i
would
return
more
than
that
you
have
known
for
some
time
the
very
day
and
almost
the
exact
hour
of
my
coming
have
even
wished
for
it
and
in
the
face
of
all
this
i
find
you
preparing
to
evade
the
requirements
of
common
hospitality
are
you
doing
either
me
or
yourself
justice
i
was
nettled
at
the
knowledge
he
displayed
of
my
movements
and
of
my
very
thoughts
my
old
stubbornness
asserted
itself
and
i
was
rude
enough
to
say
perhaps
it
is
as
you
say
at
all
events
i
am
obligated
to
keep
an
engagement
and
with
your
permission
will
now
retire
it
was
curious
to
mark
the
effect
of
this
speech
upon
the
intruder
he
immediately
became
grave
reached
quietly
into
an
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
drew
thence
the
same
glittering
horrible
mysterious
knife
that
had
so
terrified
and
bewildered
me
a
year
before
and
looking
me
steadily
in
the
eye
said
coldly
yet
with
a
certain
tone
of
sadness
well
i
will
not
grant
permission
it
is
unpleasant
to
resort
to
this
style
of
argument
but
i
do
it
to
save
time
and
controversy
i
stepped
back
in
terror
and
reached
for
the
with
the
heavy
tassel
at
the
end
that
depended
from
the
ceiling
and
was
on
the
point
of
grasping
and
giving
it
a
vigorous
pull
not
so
fast
if
you
please
he
said
sternly
as
he
stepped
forward
and
gave
the
knife
a
rapid
swish
through
the
air
above
my
head
causing
the
cord
to
fall
in
a
tangle
about
my
hand
cut
cleanly
high
above
my
reach
i
gazed
in
dumb
stupor
at
the
rope
about
my
hand
and
raised
my
eyes
to
the
remnant
above
that
was
motionless
there
was
not
the
slightest
perceptible
vibration
such
as
would
naturally
be
expected
i
turned
to
look
at
my
guest
he
had
resumed
his
seat
and
had
also
regained
his
pleasant
expression
but
he
still
held
the
knife
in
his
hand
with
his
arm
extended
at
rest
upon
the
table
which
stood
upon
his
right
illustration
the
same
glittering
mysterious
knife
let
us
have
an
end
to
this
folly
he
said
think
a
moment
and
you
will
see
that
you
are
in
fault
your
error
we
will
rectify
easily
and
then
to
business
i
will
first
show
you
the
futility
of
trying
to
escape
this
interview
and
then
we
will
proceed
to
work
for
time
presses
and
there
is
much
to
do
having
delivered
this
remark
he
detached
a
single
silvery
hair
from
his
head
blew
it
from
his
fingers
and
let
it
float
gently
upon
the
upturned
edge
of
the
knife
which
was
still
resting
on
the
table
the
hair
was
divided
as
readily
as
had
been
the
i
was
transfixed
with
astonishment
for
he
had
evidently
aimed
to
exhibit
the
quality
of
the
blade
though
he
made
no
allusion
to
the
feat
but
smilingly
went
on
with
his
discourse
it
is
just
a
year
ago
since
we
first
met
upon
that
occasion
you
made
an
agreement
with
me
which
you
are
in
honor
bound
to
keep
and
here
he
paused
as
if
to
note
the
effect
of
his
words
upon
me
then
added
significantly
will
keep
i
have
been
at
some
pains
to
impress
upon
your
mind
the
fact
that
i
would
be
here
you
responded
and
knew
that
i
was
coming
and
yet
in
obedience
to
a
silly
whim
deliberately
made
a
meaningless
engagement
with
no
other
purpose
than
to
violate
a
solemn
obligation
i
now
insist
that
you
keep
your
prior
engagement
with
me
but
i
do
not
wish
that
you
should
be
rude
to
your
friend
so
you
had
better
write
him
a
polite
note
excusing
yourself
and
dispatch
it
at
once
i
saw
that
he
was
right
and
that
there
was
no
shadow
of
justification
for
my
conduct
or
at
least
i
was
subdued
by
his
presence
so
i
wrote
the
note
without
delay
and
was
casting
about
for
some
way
to
send
it
when
he
said
fold
it
seal
it
and
address
it
you
seem
to
forget
what
is
proper
i
did
as
he
directed
mechanically
and
without
thinking
what
i
was
doing
handed
it
to
him
he
took
it
naturally
glanced
at
the
superscription
went
to
the
door
which
he
opened
slightly
and
handed
the
billet
as
if
to
some
messenger
who
seemed
to
be
in
waiting
outside
then
closed
and
locked
the
door
turning
toward
me
with
the
apparent
object
of
seeing
if
i
was
looking
he
deftly
drew
his
knife
twice
across
the
front
of
the
making
a
deep
cross
and
then
deposited
the
knife
in
his
pocket
and
resumed
his
seat
i
noted
afterward
that
the
which
was
of
solid
metal
was
cut
deeply
as
though
made
of
putty
as
soon
as
he
was
comfortably
seated
he
again
began
the
conversation
now
that
we
have
settled
the
preliminaries
i
will
ask
if
you
remember
what
i
required
of
you
a
year
ago
i
thought
that
i
did
please
repeat
it
i
wish
to
make
sure
that
you
do
then
we
will
start
fair
in
the
first
place
you
were
to
present
me
with
a
manuscript
hardly
correct
he
interrupted
i
was
to
acquaint
you
with
a
narrative
which
is
already
in
manuscript
acquaint
you
with
it
read
it
to
you
if
you
preferred
not
to
read
it
to
me
i
beg
your
pardon
i
answered
that
is
correct
you
were
to
read
the
manuscript
to
me
and
during
the
reading
i
was
to
interpose
such
comments
remarks
or
objections
as
seemed
proper
to
embody
as
interludes
in
the
manuscript
as
my
own
interpolations
however
and
not
as
part
of
the
original
very
good
he
replied
you
have
the
idea
exactly
proceed
i
agreed
that
when
the
reading
had
been
completed
i
would
seal
the
complete
manuscript
securely
deposit
it
in
some
safe
place
there
to
remain
for
thirty
years
when
it
must
be
published
illustration
drew
his
knife
twice
across
the
front
of
the
just
so
he
answered
we
understand
each
other
as
we
should
before
we
proceed
further
however
can
you
think
of
any
point
on
which
you
need
enlightenment
if
so
ask
such
questions
as
you
choose
and
i
will
answer
them
i
thought
for
a
moment
but
no
query
occurred
to
me
after
a
pause
he
said
well
if
you
think
of
nothing
now
perhaps
hereafter
questions
will
occur
to
you
which
you
can
ask
but
as
it
is
late
and
you
are
tired
we
will
not
commence
now
i
will
see
you
just
one
week
from
when
we
will
begin
from
that
time
on
we
will
follow
the
subject
as
rapidly
as
you
choose
but
see
to
it
that
you
make
no
engagements
that
will
interfere
with
our
work
for
i
shall
be
more
exacting
in
the
future
i
promised
and
he
rose
to
go
a
sudden
impulse
seized
me
and
i
said
may
i
ask
one
question
certainly
what
shall
i
call
you
why
call
me
aught
it
is
not
necessary
in
addressing
each
other
that
any
name
be
used
but
what
are
you
i
persisted
a
pained
expression
for
an
instant
rested
upon
his
face
and
he
said
sadly
pausing
between
the
words
i
am
the
man
who
did
it
did
what
ask
not
the
manuscript
will
tell
you
be
content
llewellyn
and
remember
this
that
i
am
the
man
so
saying
he
bade
me
good
night
opened
the
door
and
disappeared
down
the
broad
one
week
thereafter
he
appeared
promptly
seated
himself
and
producing
a
roll
of
manuscript
handed
it
to
me
saying
i
am
listening
you
may
begin
to
read
on
examination
i
found
each
page
to
be
somewhat
larger
than
a
sheet
of
letter
paper
with
the
written
matter
occupying
a
much
smaller
space
so
as
to
leave
a
wide
white
border
one
hundred
pages
were
in
the
package
the
last
sentence
ending
abruptly
indicated
that
my
guest
did
not
expect
to
complete
his
task
in
one
evening
and
i
may
anticipate
by
saying
that
with
each
successive
interview
he
drew
about
the
same
amount
of
writing
from
his
bosom
upon
attempting
to
read
the
manuscript
i
at
first
found
myself
puzzled
by
a
style
of
chirography
very
peculiar
and
characteristic
but
execrably
bad
vainly
did
i
attempt
to
read
it
even
the
opening
sentence
was
not
deciphered
without
long
inspection
and
great
difficulty
the
old
man
whom
i
had
promised
that
i
would
fulfill
the
task
observing
my
discomfiture
relieved
me
of
the
charge
and
without
a
word
of
introduction
read
fluently
as
follows
the
manuscript
of
i
am
the
man
chapter
iv
a
search
for
the
alchemistic
letter
i
am
the
man
who
unfortunately
for
my
future
happiness
was
dissatisfied
with
such
knowledge
as
could
be
derived
from
ordinary
books
concerning
subjects
in
which
i
had
long
been
absorbed
i
studied
the
current
works
of
my
day
on
philosophy
and
chemistry
hoping
therein
to
find
something
tangible
regarding
the
relationship
that
exists
between
matter
and
spirit
but
studied
in
vain
astronomy
history
philosophy
and
the
mysterious
incoherent
works
of
alchemy
and
occultism
were
finally
appealed
to
but
likewise
failed
to
satisfy
me
these
studies
were
pursued
in
secret
though
i
am
not
aware
that
any
necessity
existed
for
concealment
be
that
as
it
may
at
every
opportunity
i
covertly
acquainted
myself
with
such
alchemical
lore
as
could
be
obtained
either
by
purchase
or
by
correspondence
with
others
whom
i
found
to
be
pursuing
investigations
in
the
same
direction
a
translation
of
geber
de
claritate
alchemiæ
by
chance
came
into
my
possession
and
afterwards
an
original
version
from
the
latin
of
boerhaave
elementa
chemiæ
published
and
translated
in
by
peter
shaw
this
magnificent
production
threw
a
flood
of
light
upon
the
early
history
of
chemistry
being
far
more
elaborate
than
any
modern
work
it
inspired
me
with
the
deepest
regard
for
its
talented
author
and
ultimately
introduced
me
to
a
brotherhood
of
adepts
for
in
this
publication
although
its
author
disclaims
occultism
is
to
be
found
a
talisman
that
will
enable
any
earnest
searcher
after
light
to
become
a
member
of
the
society
of
secret
chemical
improvers
of
natural
philosophy
with
which
i
affiliated
as
soon
as
the
key
was
discovered
then
followed
a
systematic
investigation
of
authorities
of
the
alchemical
school
including
geber
morienus
roger
bacon
george
ripley
raymond
lully
bernard
count
of
trevise
isaac
hollandus
arnoldus
de
la
villanova
paracelsus
and
others
not
omitting
the
learned
researches
of
the
distinguished
scientist
llewellyn
illustration
of
page
of
manuscript
i
discovered
that
many
talented
men
are
still
firm
believers
in
the
lost
art
of
alchemy
and
that
among
the
followers
of
the
hermes
are
to
be
found
statesmen
clergymen
lawyers
and
scientific
men
who
for
various
reasons
invariably
conceal
with
great
tact
their
connection
with
the
fraternity
of
adepts
some
of
these
men
had
written
scientific
treatises
of
a
very
different
character
from
those
circulating
among
the
members
of
our
brotherhood
and
to
their
materialistic
readers
it
would
seem
scarcely
possible
that
the
authors
could
be
tainted
with
hallucinations
of
any
description
while
others
conspicuous
leaders
in
the
church
were
seemingly
beyond
occult
temptation
the
larger
number
it
was
evident
hoped
by
studies
of
the
works
of
the
alchemists
to
find
the
key
to
the
alkahest
of
van
helmont
that
is
to
discover
the
philosopher
stone
or
the
elixir
of
life
and
from
their
writings
it
is
plain
that
the
inner
consciousness
of
thoughtful
and
scientific
men
rebelled
against
confinement
to
the
narrow
bounds
of
materialistic
science
within
which
they
were
forced
to
appear
as
dogmatic
pessimists
to
them
scientific
orthodoxy
acting
as
a
weight
prohibited
intellectual
speculation
as
rank
heresy
a
few
of
my
were
expert
manipulators
and
worked
experimentally
following
in
their
laboratories
the
suggestions
of
those
gifted
students
who
had
pored
over
precious
old
manuscripts
and
had
attempted
to
solve
the
enigmatical
formulas
recorded
therein
puzzles
familiar
to
students
of
hermetic
lore
it
was
thus
demonstrated
for
what
i
have
related
is
history
that
in
this
nineteenth
century
there
exists
a
fraternity
the
members
of
which
are
as
earnest
in
their
belief
in
the
truth
of
esoteric
philosophy
as
were
the
followers
of
hermes
himself
savants
who
in
secret
circulate
among
themselves
a
literature
that
the
materialism
of
this
selfsame
nineteenth
century
has
relegated
to
the
deluded
and
murky
periods
that
produced
it
one
day
a
postal
package
came
to
my
address
this
being
the
manner
in
which
some
of
our
literature
circulated
which
on
examination
i
found
to
be
a
letter
of
instruction
and
advice
from
some
unknown
member
of
our
circle
i
was
already
becoming
disheartened
over
the
mental
confusion
into
which
my
studies
were
leading
me
and
the
contents
of
the
letter
in
which
i
was
greatly
interested
made
a
lasting
impression
upon
me
it
seemed
to
have
been
circulating
a
long
time
among
our
members
in
europe
and
america
for
it
bore
numerous
marginal
notes
of
various
dates
but
each
and
every
one
of
its
readers
had
for
one
reason
or
another
declined
the
task
therein
suggested
from
the
substance
of
the
paper
which
written
exquisitely
yet
partook
of
the
ambiguous
alchemistic
style
it
was
evident
that
the
author
was
well
versed
in
alchemy
and
in
order
that
my
position
may
be
clearly
understood
at
this
turning
point
in
a
life
of
remarkable
adventure
the
letter
is
appended
in
full
the
alchemistic
letter
to
the
brother
adept
who
dares
try
to
discover
zoroaster
cave
or
the
philosopher
intellectual
echoes
by
means
of
which
they
communicate
to
one
another
from
their
caves
know
thou
that
hermes
trismegistus
did
not
originate
but
he
gave
to
our
philosophy
his
name
the
hermetic
art
evolved
in
a
dim
mystic
age
before
antiquity
began
it
endured
through
the
slowly
rolling
cycles
to
be
bandied
about
by
the
flippancy
of
nineteenth
century
students
it
has
lived
because
it
is
endowed
with
that
quality
which
never
dies
truth
modern
philosophy
of
which
chemistry
is
but
a
fragment
draws
its
sustenance
from
the
prime
facts
which
were
revealed
in
ancient
egypt
through
hermetic
thought
and
fixed
by
the
hermetic
stylus
the
hermetic
allegories
so
various
in
interpretable
susceptibility
led
subsequent
thinkers
into
speculations
and
experimentations
which
have
resulted
profitably
to
the
world
it
is
not
strange
that
some
of
the
followers
of
hermes
especially
the
more
mercurial
and
imaginative
should
have
evolved
nebulous
theories
no
longer
explainable
and
involving
recondite
spiritual
considerations
know
thou
that
the
ultimate
on
investigation
is
the
proximate
of
the
infinite
accordingly
a
class
came
to
believe
that
a
projection
of
natural
mental
faculties
into
an
advanced
state
of
consciousness
called
the
wisdom
faculty
constitutes
the
final
possibility
of
alchemy
the
attainment
of
this
exalted
condition
is
still
believed
practicable
by
many
earnest
savants
once
on
this
lofty
plane
the
individual
would
not
be
trammelled
by
material
obstacles
but
would
abide
in
that
spiritual
placidity
which
is
the
exquisite
realization
of
mortal
perfection
so
exalted
he
would
be
in
naked
parallelism
with
omniscience
and
through
his
illuminated
understanding
could
feast
his
soul
on
those
exalted
pleasures
which
are
only
less
than
deific
notwithstanding
the
exploitings
of
a
number
of
these
philosophers
in
which
by
reason
of
our
inability
to
comprehend
sense
seemed
lost
in
a
passage
of
incohesive
dreamery
and
resonancy
of
terminology
some
of
the
purest
spiritual
researches
the
world
has
ever
known
were
made
in
the
dawn
of
history
the
much
abused
alchemical
philosophers
existed
upon
a
plane
in
some
respects
above
the
level
of
the
science
of
many
of
them
lived
for
the
good
of
the
world
only
in
an
atmosphere
above
the
materialistic
hordes
that
people
the
world
and
toiling
over
their
crucibles
and
alembics
died
in
their
cells
uttering
no
voice
take
for
example
eirenæus
philalethes
who
born
in
lived
contemporaneously
with
robert
boyle
a
fragment
from
his
writings
will
illustrate
the
purpose
which
impelled
the
searcher
for
the
true
light
of
alchemy
to
record
his
discoveries
in
allegories
and
we
have
no
right
to
question
the
honesty
of
his
utterances
the
searcher
of
all
hearts
knows
that
i
write
the
truth
nor
is
there
any
cause
to
accuse
me
of
envy
i
write
with
an
unterrified
quill
in
an
unheard
of
style
to
the
honor
of
god
to
the
profit
of
my
neighbors
with
contempt
of
the
world
and
its
riches
because
elias
the
artist
is
already
born
and
now
glorious
things
are
declared
of
the
city
of
god
i
dare
affirm
that
i
do
possess
more
riches
than
the
whole
known
world
is
worth
but
i
can
not
make
use
of
it
because
of
the
snares
of
knaves
i
disdain
loathe
and
detest
the
idolizing
of
silver
and
gold
by
which
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
the
world
are
celebrated
ah
filthy
evil
ah
vain
nothingness
believe
ye
that
i
conceal
the
art
out
of
envy
no
verily
i
protest
to
you
i
grieve
from
the
very
bottom
of
my
soul
that
we
alchemists
are
driven
like
vagabonds
from
the
face
of
the
lord
throughout
the
earth
but
what
need
of
many
words
the
thing
that
we
have
seen
taught
and
made
which
we
have
possess
and
know
that
we
do
declare
being
moved
with
compassion
for
the
studious
and
with
indignation
of
gold
silver
and
precious
stones
believe
me
the
time
is
at
the
door
i
feel
it
in
spirit
when
we
adeptists
shall
return
from
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
nor
shall
we
fear
any
snares
that
are
laid
against
our
lives
but
we
shall
give
thanks
to
the
lord
our
god
i
would
to
god
that
every
ingenious
man
in
the
whole
earth
understood
this
science
then
it
would
be
valued
only
for
its
wisdom
and
virtue
only
would
be
had
in
honor
of
course
there
was
a
more
worldly
class
and
a
large
contingent
of
mercenary
impostors
as
science
is
always
encumbered
parasites
whose
animus
was
shamefully
unlike
the
purity
of
true
esoteric
psychologists
these
men
devoted
their
lives
to
experimentation
for
selfish
advancement
they
constructed
alchemical
outfits
and
carried
on
a
ceaseless
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
solvents
and
studied
their
influences
on
earthly
bodies
their
ultimate
object
being
the
discovery
of
the
philosopher
stone
and
the
alkahest
which
boerhaave
asserts
was
never
discovered
their
records
were
often
a
verbose
melange
purposely
so
written
no
doubt
to
cover
their
tracks
and
to
make
themselves
conspicuous
other
hermetic
believers
occupied
a
more
elevated
position
and
connected
the
intellectual
with
the
material
hoping
to
gain
by
their
philosophy
and
science
not
only
gold
and
silver
which
were
secondary
considerations
but
the
highest
literary
achievement
the
magnum
opus
others
still
sought
to
draw
from
astrology
and
magic
the
secrets
that
would
lead
them
to
their
ambitious
goal
thus
there
were
degrees
of
fineness
in
a
fraternity
which
the
science
of
must
recognize
and
admit
boerhaave
the
illustrious
respected
geber
of
the
alchemistic
school
and
none
need
feel
compromised
in
admiring
the
talented
alchemists
who
like
geber
wrought
in
the
twilight
of
morn
for
the
coming
world
good
we
are
now
enjoying
a
fragment
of
the
ultimate
results
of
their
genius
and
industry
in
the
materialistic
outcomes
of
chemistry
to
be
followed
by
others
more
valuable
and
at
last
when
mankind
is
ripe
in
the
wisdom
faculty
by
spiritual
contentment
in
the
complacent
furtherings
beyond
allow
me
briefly
to
refer
to
a
few
men
of
the
alchemistic
type
whose
records
may
be
considered
with
advantage
rhasis
a
conspicuous
alchemist
born
in
first
mentioned
orpiment
borax
compounds
of
iron
copper
arsenic
and
other
similar
substances
it
is
said
too
that
he
discovered
the
art
of
making
brandy
about
a
century
later
alfarabe
killed
in
a
great
alchemist
astonished
the
king
of
syria
with
his
profound
learning
and
excited
the
admiration
of
the
wise
men
of
the
east
by
his
varied
accomplishments
later
albertus
magnus
born
noted
for
his
talent
and
skill
believed
firmly
in
the
doctrine
of
transmutation
his
beloved
pupil
thomas
aquinas
gave
us
the
word
amalgam
and
it
still
serves
us
contemporaneously
with
these
lived
roger
bacon
born
who
was
a
man
of
most
extraordinary
ability
there
has
never
been
a
greater
english
intellect
not
excepting
his
illustrious
namesake
lord
bacon
and
his
penetrating
mind
delved
deeper
into
nature
laws
than
that
of
any
successor
he
told
us
of
facts
concerning
the
sciences
that
scientific
men
can
not
fully
comprehend
he
told
us
of
other
things
that
lie
beyond
the
science
provings
of
that
modern
philosophers
can
not
grasp
he
was
an
enthusiastic
believer
in
the
hermetic
philosophy
and
such
were
his
erudition
and
advanced
views
that
his
brother
friars
through
jealousy
and
superstition
had
him
thrown
into
prison
a
common
fate
to
men
who
in
those
days
dared
to
think
ahead
of
their
age
despite
as
some
would
say
of
his
mighty
reasoning
power
and
splendid
attainments
he
believed
the
philosopher
stone
to
be
a
reality
he
believed
the
secret
of
indefinite
prolongation
of
life
abode
in
alchemy
that
the
future
could
be
predicted
by
means
of
a
mirror
which
he
called
almuchese
and
that
by
alchemy
an
adept
could
produce
pure
gold
he
asserted
that
by
means
of
aristotle
secret
of
secrets
pure
gold
can
be
made
gold
even
purer
and
finer
than
what
men
now
know
as
gold
in
connection
with
other
predictions
he
made
an
assertion
that
may
with
other
seemingly
unreasonable
predictions
be
verified
in
time
to
come
he
said
it
is
equally
possible
to
construct
cars
which
may
be
set
in
motion
with
marvelous
rapidity
independently
of
horses
or
other
animals
he
declared
that
the
ancients
had
done
this
and
he
believed
the
art
might
be
revived
following

enthusiasts

illustrated
his
arguments
by
a
series
of
ingenious
and
beautiful
experiments
that
stand
so
high
in
the
estimation
of
scientific
men
that
his
remarks
are
copied
verbatim
by
our
highest
authorities
and
his
apparatus
is
the
best
yet
devised
for
the
purpose
boyle

which
did
not

prevent
french

german
scientific

from
giving
the
credit
to
mariotte
and
they
still
follow
the
false
teacher
who
boldly
pirated
not
only
boyle
ideas
but
stole
his
apparatus
then
appeared
such
men
as

the
rape
of

lock
should
have
been
thrown
into
a
prison
to
perish
as
a

and
this
should
teach
us
not
to
question
the
earnestness
of
those
who
left
us
as
a
legacy
the
beauty
and
truth
so
abundantly
found
in
pure
alchemy
these
and
many
others
cotemporaries
some
conspicuous
and
others
whose
names
do
not
shine
in

history
contributed
incalculably
to
the
grand
aggregate
of
knowledge
concerning
the
divine
secret
which
enriched
the

compare
the
benefits
of

with
the

of

kings
and

upon
himself
in
many
respects
the
most
audacious
pretender
that
history
records
he
raised
the
hermetic
art
to
a
dazzling
height
and
finally
buried
it
in
a
blaze
of
splendor
as
he
passed
from
existence
beneath
a
mantle
of
shame
as

plodding
chemist

his
tedious
mechanical
methods
and
cold
unresponsive
materialistic
dogmas
arose
from
the
ashes
and
sprang
into
prominence
read
the
story
backward
and
you
shall
see
that
in
alchemy
we
behold
the
beginning
of
all
the
sciences
of
alchemy
is
the
cradle
that
rocked
them
fostered
with
necromancy
astrology
occultism
and
all
the
progeny
of
mystic
dreamery
the
infant
sciences
struggled
for
existence
through
the
dark
ages
in
care
of
the
once
persecuted
and
now
traduced
alchemist
the
world
owes
a
monument
more
to
hermetic
heroes
than
to
all
other
influences
and
instrumentalities
religion
excepted
combined
for
our
present
civilization
is
largely
a
legacy
from
the
alchemist
begin
with
hermes
trismegistus
and
close
with
joseph
balsamo
and
if
you
are
inclined
towards
science
do
not
criticise
too
severely
their
verbal
logorrhea
and
their
romanticism
for
your
science
is
treading
backward
it
will
encroach
upon
their
field
again
and
you
may
have
to
unsay
your
words
of
hasty
censure
these
men
fulfilled
their
mission
and
did
it
well
if
they
told
more
than
men
now
think
they
knew
they
also
knew
more
than
they
told
and
more
than
modern
philosophy
embraces
they
could
not
live
to
see
all
the
future
they
eagerly
hoped
for
but
they
started
a
future
for
mankind
that
will
far
exceed
in
sweetness
and
light
the
most
entrancing
visions
of
their
most
imaginative
dreamers
they
spoke
of
the
existence
of
a
red
elixir
and
while
they
wrote
the
barbarous
world
about
them
ran
red
with
blood
blood
of
the
pure
in
heart
blood
of
the
saints
blood
of
a
saviour
and
their
allegory
and
wisdom
formulæ
were
recorded
in
blood
of
their
own
sacrifices
they
dreamed
of
a
white
elixir
that
is
yet
to
bless
mankind
and
a
brighter
day
for
man
a
period
of
peace
happiness
long
life
contentment
good
will
and
brotherly
love
and
in
the
name
of
this
white
elixir
they
directed
the
world
towards
a
vision
of
divine
light
even
pure
gold
as
they
told
the
materialistic
world
who
worship
gold
was
penetrated
and
whelmed
by
this
subtle
superlatively
refined
spirit
of
matter
is
not
the
day
of
the
allegorical
white
elixir
nearly
at

would
that
it
were
i
say
to
you
now
brothers
of
the
eighteenth
century
as
one
speaking
by
authority

you
cease
some
of
you
to

past

the
future
by
grasping
the
present
cast
aside
some
of
you
the
alchemical
lore
of
other
days
give
up
your
loved
allegories
it
is
a
duty
you
must
relinquish
them
there
is
a
richer
field
do
not
delay
unlock
this
mystic
door
that
stands
hinged
and
ready
waiting

touch
of
men
who

mankind
the

a

concealed
much
knowledge
that
should
now
be
spread
before
the

and
added
to
the
treasures
of
our
circle
of
adepts
this
cabalistic
wisdom
is
not
recorded
in
books
nor
in

but
has
been
purposely
preserved
from
the
uninitiated
in
the
unreadable
brains
of
unresponsive

those

thereof

all

and
men
are

to
unravel
the
golden
threads
that
mystic
wisdom
has
inwoven
in
her

secret
knowledge
look
for
knowledge
where
i

indicated
and
to
gain
it
do
not

to
swear
allegiance
to
this
sacred
order
for
so
you
must
do
to
gain

then
you

what

you

however

a
sacred
duty
for
the
world
will
profit
humanity
will
be
the
gainer
peace
on
earth
good
will
to
man
will
be
closer
to
mankind
and
at
last
when
the
sign
appears
the
white

will
no

be
allegorical
it
will
become
a
reality
in
the

their
secrets

here
this
letter
ended
it
was
evident
that
the
writer
referred
to
a
secret
society
into
which
i
could
probably
enter
and
taking
the
advice
i
did
not
hesitate
but
applied
at
once
for
membership
i
determined
regardless
of
consequence
to
follow
the
suggestion
of
the
unknown
writer
and
by
so
doing
for
i
accepted
their
pledges
i
invited
my
destiny
my
guest
of
the
massive
forehead
paused
for
a
moment
stroked
his
long
white
beard
and
then
after
casting
an
inquiring
glance
on
me
asked
shall
i
read
on
yes
i
replied
and
the
man
who
did
it
proceeded
as
follows
chapter
the
writing
of
my
confession
having
become
a
member
of
the
secret
society
as
directed
by
the
writer
of
the
letter
i
have
just
read
and
having
obtained
the
secrets
hinted
at
in
the
mystic
directions
my
next
desire
was
to
find
a
secluded
spot
where
without
interruption
i
could
prepare
for
publication
what
i
had
gathered
surreptitiously
in
the
lodges
of
the
fraternity
i
designed
to
betray
this
i
entitled
my
confession
alas
why
did
my
evil
genius
prompt
me
to
write
it
why
did
not
some
kind
angel
withhold
my
hand
from
the
rash
and
wicked
deed
all
i
can
urge
in
defense
or
palliation
is
that
i
was
infatuated
by
the
fatal
words
of
the
letter
you
must
act
what
men
will
call
the
traitor
but
humanity
will
be
the
gainer
in
a
section
of
the
state
in
which
i
resided
a
certain
creek
forms
the
boundary
line
between
two
townships
and
also
between
two
counties
crossing
this
creek
a
much
traveled
road
stretches

uniting
the
extremes
of

about
four

creek
also
present
themselves
to
my
memory
and
midway
between
them
on
the
north
side
of
the
road
was
a
substantial
farm
house
in
going
west
from
the
easternmost
of
these
villages
the
traveler
begins
to
descend
from
the
very
center
of
the
town
in
no
place
is
the
grade
steep
as
the
road
lies
between
the
spurs
of
the
hill
abutting
upon
the
valley
that
feeds
the
creek
i
have
mentioned
having
reached
the
valley
the
road
winds
a
short
distance
to
the
right
then
turning
to
the
left
crosses
the
stream
and
immediately
begins
to
climb
the
western
hill
here
the
ascent
is
more
difficult
for
the
road
lies
diagonally
over
the
edge
of
the
hill
a
mile
of
travel
as
i
recall
the
scene
sometimes
up
a
steep
and
again
among
rich
level
farm
lands
and
then
on
the
very
height
close
to
the
road
within
a
few
feet
of
it
appears
the
square
structure
which
was
at
the
time
i
mention
known
as
the
stone
tavern
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
were
located
extensive
stables
and
a
grain
barn
in
the
northeast
chamber
of
that
stone
building
during
a
summer
in
the
twenties
i
wrote
for
publication
the
description
of
the
mystic
work
that
my
oath
should
have
made
forever
a
secret
a
sacred
trust
i
am
the
man
who
wantonly
committed
the
deplorable
act
under
the
infatuation
of
that
alchemical
manuscript
i
strove
to
show
the
world
that
i
could
and
would
do
that
which
might
never
benefit
me
in
the
least
but
might
serve
humanity
it
was
fate
i
was
not
a
bad
man
neither
malignity
avarice
nor
ambition
forming
a
part
of
my
nature
i
was
a
close
student
of
a
rather
retiring
disposition
a
by
trade
careless
and
indifferent
to
public
honors
and
so
thriftless
that
many
trifling
neighborhood
debts
had
accumulated
against
me
what
i
have
reluctantly
told
for
i
am
forbidden
to
give
the
names
of
the
localities
comprises
an
abstract
of
part
of
the
record
of
my
early
life
and
will
introduce
the
extraordinary
narrative
which
follows
that
i
have
spoken
the
truth
and
in
no
manner
overdrawn
will
be
silently
evidenced
by
hundreds
of
brethren
both
of
the
occult
society
and
the
fraternal
brotherhood
with
which
i
united
who
can
if
they
will
testify
to
the
accuracy
of
the
narrative
they
know
the
story
of
my
crime
and
disgrace
only
myself
and
god
know
the
full
retribution
that
followed
chapter
vi
kidnapped
the
events
just
narrated
occurred
in
the
prime
of
my
life
and
are
partly
matters
of
publicity
my
attempted
breach
of
faith
in
the
way
of
disclosing
their
secrets
was
naturally
infamous
in
the
eyes
of
my
society
brethren
who
endeavored
to
prevail
upon
me
to
relent
of
my
design
which
after
writing
my
confession
i
made
no
endeavor
to
conceal
their
importunities
and
threatenings
had
generally
been
resisted
however
and
with
an
obliquity
that
can
not
be
easily
explained
i
persisted
in
my
unreasonable
design
i
was
blessed
as
a
husband
and
father
but
neither
the
thought
of
home
wife
nor
child
checked
me
in
my
inexplicable
course
i
was
certainly
irresponsible
perhaps
a
monomaniac
and
yet
on
the
subject
in
which
i
was
absorbed
i
preserved
my
mental
equipoise
and
knowingly
followed
a
course
that
finally
brought
me
into
the
deepest
slough
of
trouble
and
lost
to
me
forever
all
that
man
loves
most
dearly
an
overruling
spirit
perhaps
the
shade
of
one
of
the
old
alchemists
possessed
me
and
in
the
face
of
obstacles
that
would
have
caused
most
men
to
reflect
and
retrace
their
steps
i
madly
rushed
onward
the
influence
that
impelled
me
whatever
it
may
have
been
was
irresistible
i
apparently
acted
the
part
of
agent
subject
to
an
master
essence
and
under
this
dominating
spirit
or
demon
my
mind
was
powerless
in
its
subjection
my
soul
was
driven
imperiously
by
that
impelling
and
indescribable
something
and
was
as
passive
and
irresponsible
as
lycopodium
that
is
borne
onward
in
a
steady
current
of
air
methods
were
vainly
sought
by
those
who
loved
me
brethren
of
the
lodge
and
others
who
endeavored
to
induce
me
to
change
my
headstrong
purpose
but
i
could
neither
accept
their
counsels
nor
heed
their
forebodings
summons
by
law
were
served
on
me
in
order
to
disconcert
me
and
my
numerous
small
debts
became
the
pretext
for
legal
warrants
until
at
last
all
my
papers
excepting
my
confession
and
my
person
also
were
seized
upon
an
execution
served
by
a
constable
minor
claims
were
quickly
satisfied
but
when
i
regained
my
liberty
the
aggression
continued
even
arson
was
resorted
to
and
the
printing
office
that
held
my
manuscript
was
fired
one
night
that
the
obnoxious
revelation
which
i
persisted
in
putting
into
print
might
be
destroyed
finally
i
found
myself
separated
by
process
of
law
from
home
and
friends
an
inmate
of
a
jail
my
opponents
as
i
now
came
to
consider
them
had
confined
me
in
prison
for
a
debt
of
only
two
dollars
a
sufficient
amount
at
that
time
in
that
state
for
my
incarceration
smarting
under
the
humiliation
my
spirit
became
still
more
rebellious
and
i
now
perhaps
justly
came
to
view
myself
as
a
martyr
it
had
been
at
first
asserted
that
i
had
stolen
a
shirt
but
i
was
not
afraid
of
any
penalty
that
could
be
laid
on
me
for
this
charge
believing
that
the
imputation
and
the
arrest
would
be
shown
to
be
designed
as
willful
oppression
therefore
it
was
that
when
this
contemptible
arraignment
had
been
swept
aside
and
i
was
freed
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
i
experienced
more
than
a
little
surprise
at
a
rearrest
and
at
finding
myself
again
thrown
into
jail
i
knew
that
it
had
been
decreed
by
my
brethren
that
i
must
retract
and
destroy
my
confession
and
this
fact
made
me
the
more
determined
to
prevent
its
destruction
and
i
persisted
sullenly
in
pursuing
my
course
on
the
evening
of
august
my
jailer
wife
informed
me
that
the
debt
for
which
i
had
been
incarcerated
had
been
paid
by
unknown
friends
and
that
i
could
depart
and
i
accepted
the
statement
without
question
upon
my
stepping
from
the
door
of
the
jail
however
my
arms
were
firmly
grasped
by
two
persons
one
on
each
side
of
me
and
before
i
could
realize
the
fact
that
i
was
being
kidnapped
i
was
thrust
into
a
closed
coach
which
immediately
rolled
away
but
not
until
i
made
an
outcry
which
if
heard
by
anyone
was
unheeded
for
your
own
sake
be
quiet
said
one
of
my
companions
in
confinement
for
the
carriage
was
draped
to
exclude
the
light
and
was
as
dark
as
a
dungeon
my
spirit
rebelled
i
felt
that
i
was
on
the
brink
of
a
remarkable
perhaps
perilous
experience
and
i
indignantly
replied
by
asking
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
presume
forcibly
to
imprison
me
am
i
not
a
freeman
of
america
what
have
you
done
he
answered
have
you
not
bound
yourself
by
a
series
of
vows
that
are
sacred
and
should
be
inviolable
and
have
you
not
broken
them
as
no
other
man
has
done
before
you
have
you
not
betrayed
your
trust
and
merited
a
severe
judgment
did
you
not
voluntarily
ask
admission
into
our
ancient
brotherhood
and
in
good
faith
were
you
not
initiated
into
our
sacred
mysteries
did
you
not
obligate
yourself
before
man
and
on
your
sacred
honor
promise
to
preserve
our
secrets
i
did
i
replied
but
previously
i
had
sworn
before
a
higher
tribunal
to
scatter
this
precious
wisdom
to
the
world
yes
he
said
and
you
know
full
well
the
depth
of
the
solemn
oath
that
you
took
with
us
more
solemn
than
that
prescribed
by
any
open
court
on
earth
this
i
do
not
deny
i
said
and
yet
i
am
glad
that
i
accomplished
my
object
even
though
you
have
now
as
is
evident
the
power
to
pronounce
my
sentence
you
should
look
for
the
death
sentence
was
the
reply
but
it
has
been
ordained
instead
that
you
are
to
be
given
a
lengthened
life
you
should
expect
bodily
destruction
but
on
the
contrary
you
will
pass
on
in
consciousness
of
earth
and
earthly
concerns
when
we
are
gone
your
name
will
be
known
to
all
lands
and
yet
from
this
time
you
will
be
unknown
for
the
welfare
of
future
humanity
you
will
be
thrust
to
a
height
in
our
order
that
will
annihilate
you
as
a
mortal
being
and
yet
you
will
exist
suspended
between
life
and
death
and
in
that
intermediate
state
will
know
that
you
exist
you
have
as
you
confess
merited
a
severe
punishment
but
we
can
only
punish
in
accordance
with
an
unwritten
law
that
instructs
the
person
punished
and
elevates
the
human
race
in
consequence
you
stand
alone
among
mortals
in
that
you
have
openly
attempted
to
give
broadly
to
those
who
have
not
earned
it
our
most
sacred
property
a
property
that
did
not
belong
to
you
property
that
you
have
only
been
permitted
to
handle
that
has
been
handed
from
man
to
man
from
before
the
time
of
solomon
and
which
belongs
to
no
one
man
and
will
continue
to
pass
in
this
way
from
one
to
another
as
a
hallowed
trust
until
there
are
no
men
as
men
now
exist
to
receive
it
you
will
soon
go
into
the
shadows
of
darkness
and
will
learn
many
of
the
mysteries
of
life
the
undeveloped
mysteries
that
are
withheld
from
your
fellows
but
which
you
who
have
been
so
presumptuous
and
anxious
for
knowledge
are
destined
to
possess
and
solve
you
will
find
secrets
that
man
as
man
is
now
constituted
can
not
yet
discover
and
yet
which
the
future
man
must
gain
and
be
instructed
in
as
you
have
sowed
so
shall
you
reap
you
wished
to
become
a
distributor
of
knowledge
you
shall
now
by
bodily
trial
and
mental
suffering
obtain
unsought
knowledge
to
distribute
and
in
time
to
come
you
will
be
commanded
to
make
your
discoveries
known
as
your
pathway
is
surely
laid
out
so
must
you
walk
it
is
ordained
to
rebel
is
useless
who
has
pronounced
this
sentence
i
asked
a
judge
neither
of
heaven
nor
of
earth
you
speak
in
enigmas
no
i
speak
openly
and
the
truth
our
brotherhood
is
linked
with
the
past
and
clasps
hands
with
the
antediluvians
the
flood
scattered
the
races
of
earth
but
did
not
disturb
our
secrets
the
great
love
of
wisdom
has
from
generation
to
generation
led
selected
members
of
our
organization
to
depths
of
study
that
our
open
work
does
not
touch
upon
and
behind
our
highest
officers
there
stand
in
the
occult
shades
between
the
here
and
the
hereafter
unknown
and
unseen
agents
who
are
initiated
into
secrets
above
and
beyond
those
known
to
the
ordinary
craft
those
who
are
introduced
into
these
inner
recesses
acquire
superhuman
conceptions
and
do
not
give
an
open
sign
of
fellowship
they
need
no
talisman
they
walk
our
streets
possessed
of
powers
unknown
to
men
they
concern
themselves
as
mortals
in
the
affairs
of
men
and
even
their
brethren
of
the
initiated
open
order
are
unaware
of
their
exalted
condition
the
means
by
which
they
have
been
instructed
their
several
individualities
as
well
have
been
concealed
because
publicity
would
destroy
their
value
and
injure
humanity
cause
silence
followed
these
vague
disclosures
and
the
carriage
rolled
on
i
was
mystified
and
alarmed
and
yet
i
knew
that
whatever
might
be
the
end
of
this
nocturnal
ride
i
had
invited
it
yes
merited
it
and
i
steeled
myself
to
hear
the
sentence
of
my
judges
in
whose
hands
i
was
powerless
the
persons
on
the
seat
opposite
me
continued
their
conversation
in
low
tones
audible
only
to
themselves
an
individual
by
my
side
neither
moved
nor
spoke
there
were
four
of
us
in
the
carriage
as
i
learned
intuitively
although
we
were
surrounded
by
utter
darkness
at
length
i
addressed
the
companion
beside
me
for
the
silence
was
unbearable
friend
or
enemy
though
he
might
be
anything
rather
than
this
long
silence
how
long
shall
we
continue
in
this
carriage
he
made
no
reply
after
a
time
i
again
spoke
can
you
not
tell
me
comrade
how
long
our
journey
will
last
when
shall
we
reach
our
destination
silence
only
putting
out
my
hand
i
ventured
to
touch
my
mate
and
found
that
he
was
tightly
strapped
bound
upright
to
the
seat
and
the
back
of
the
carriage
leather
thongs
held
him
firmly
in
position
and
as
i
pondered
over
the
mystery
i
thought
to
myself
if
i
make
a
disturbance
they
will
not
hesitate
to
manacle
me
as
securely
my
custodians
seemed
however
not
to
exercise
a
guard
over
me
and
yet
i
felt
that
they
were
certain
of
my
inability
to
escape
if
the
man
on
the
seat
was
a
prisoner
why
was
he
so
reticent
why
did
he
not
answer
my
questions
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
be
gagged
as
well
as
bound
then
i
determined
to
find
out
if
this
were
so
i
began
to
realize
more
forcibly
that
a
terrible
sentence
must
have
been
meted
me
and
i
half
hoped
that
i
could
get
from
my
partner
in
captivity
some
information
regarding
our
destination
sliding
my
hand
cautiously
along
his
chest
and
under
his
chin
i
intended
to
remove
the
gag
from
his
mouth
when
i
felt
my
flesh
creep
for
it
came
in
contact
with
the
cold
rigid
flesh
of
a
corpse
the
man
was
dead
and
stiff
the
shock
unnerved
me
i
had
begun
to
experience
the
results
of
a
severe
mental
strain
partly
induced
by
the
recent
imprisonment
and
extended
previous
persecution
and
partly
by
the
mysterious
significance
of
the
language
in
which
i
had
recently
been
addressed
the
sentence
you
will
now
go
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
learn
the
mysteries
of
life
kept
ringing
through
my
head
and
even
then
i
sat
beside
a
corpse
after
this
discovery
i
remained
for
a
time
in
a
in
a
state
of
profound
dejection
how
long
i
can
not
say
then
i
experienced
an
inexplicable
change
such
as
i
imagine
comes
over
a
condemned
man
without
hope
of
reprieve
and
i
became
unconcerned
as
a
man
might
who
had
accepted
his
destiny
and
stoically
determined
to
await
it
perhaps
moments
passed
it
may
have
been
hours
and
then
indifference
gave
place
to
reviving
curiosity
i
realized
that
i
could
die
only
once
and
i
coolly
and
complacently
revolved
the
matter
speculating
over
my
possible
fate
as
i
look
back
on
the
night
in
which
i
rode
beside
that
dead
man
facing
the
mysterious
agents
of
an
judge
i
marvel
over
a
mental
condition
that
permitted
me
finally
to
rest
in
peace
and
slumber
in
unconcern
so
i
did
however
and
after
a
period
the
length
of
which
i
am
not
able
to
estimate
i
awoke
and
soon
thereafter
the
carriage
stopped
and
our
horses
were
changed
after
which
our
journey
was
resumed
to
continue
hour
after
hour
and
at
last
i
slept
again
leaning
back
in
the
corner
suddenly
i
was
violently
shaken
from
slumber
and
commanded
to
alight
it
was
in
the
gray
of
morning
and
before
i
could
realize
what
was
happening
i
was
transferred
by
my
captors
to
another
carriage
and
the
dead
man
also
was
rudely
hustled
along
and
thrust
beside
me
my
companions
speaking
to
him
as
though
he
were
alive
indeed
as
i
look
back
on
these
maneuvers
i
perceive
that
to
all
appearances
i
was
one
of
the
abducting
party
and
our
actions
were
really
such
as
to
induce
an
observer
to
believe
that
this
dead
man
was
an
obstinate
prisoner
and
myself
one
of
his
official
guards
the
drivers
of
the
carriages
seemed
to
give
us
no
attention
but
they
sat
upright
and
unconcerned
and
certainly
neither
of
them
interested
himself
in
our
transfer
the
second
carriage
like
that
other
previously
described
was
securely
closed
and
our
journey
was
continued
the
darkness
was
as
of
a
dungeon
it
may
have
been
days
i
could
not
tell
anything
about
the
passage
of
time
on
and
on
we
rode
occasionally
food
and
drink
were
handed
in
but
my
captors
held
to
their
course
and
at
last
i
was
taken
from
the
vehicle
and
transferred
to
a
i
had
been
carried
rapidly
and
in
secret
a
hundred
or
more
miles
perhaps
into
another
state
and
probably
all
traces
of
my
journey
were
effectually
lost
to
outsiders
i
was
in
the
hands
of
men
who
implicitly
obeyed
the
orders
of
their
superiors
masters
whom
they
had
never
seen
and
probably
did
not
know
i
needed
no
reminder
of
the
fact
that
i
had
violated
every
sacred
pledge
voluntarily
made
to
the
craft
and
now
that
they
held
me
powerless
i
well
knew
that
whatever
the
punishment
assigned
i
had
invited
it
and
could
not
prevent
its
fulfillment
that
it
would
be
severe
i
realized
that
it
would
not
be
in
accordance
with
ordinary
human
law
i
accepted
illustration
i
was
taken
from
the
vehicle
and
transferred
to
a
had
i
not
in
secret
in
my
little
room
in
that
obscure
stone
tavern
engrossed
on
paper
the
mystic
sentences
that
never
before
had
been
penned
and
were
unknown
excepting
to
persons
initiated
into
our
sacred
mysteries
had
i
not
previously
in
the
most
solemn
manner
before
these
words
had
been
imparted
to
my
keeping
sworn
to
keep
them
inviolate
and
secret
and
had
i
not
deliberately
broken
that
sacred
vow
and
scattered
the
hoarded
sentences
broadcast
my
part
as
a
brother
in
this
fraternal
organization
was
that
of
the
holder
only
of
property
that
belonged
to
no
man
that
had
been
handed
from
one
to
another
through
the
ages
sacredly
cherished
and
faithfully
protected
by
men
of
many
tongues
always
considered
a
trust
a
charge
of
honor
and
never
before
betrayed
my
crime
was
deep
and
dark
i
shuddered
come
what
may
i
mused
reflecting
over
my
perfidy
i
am
ready
for
the
penalty
and
my
fate
is
deserved
it
can
not
but
be
a
righteous
one
the
words
of
the
occupant
of
the
carriage
occurred
to
me
again
and
again
that
one
sentence
kept
ringing
in
my
brain
i
could
not
dismiss
it
you
have
been
tried
convicted
and
we
are
of
those
appointed
to
carry
out
the
sentence
of
the
judges
the
black
silence
of
my
lonely
cell
beat
against
me
i
could
feel
the
absence
of
sound
i
could
feel
the
dismal
weight
of
nothingness
and
in
my
solitude
and
distraction
i
cried
out
in
anguish
to
the
invisible
judge
i
am
ready
for
my
sentence
whether
it
be
death
or
imprisonment
for
life
and
still
the
further
words
of
the
occupant
of
the
carriage
passed
through
my
mind
you
will
now
go
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
will
learn
the
mysteries
of
life
then
i
slept
to
awake
and
sleep
again
i
kept
no
note
of
time
it
may
have
been
days
or
weeks
so
far
as
my
record
could
determine
an
attendant
came
at
intervals
to
minister
to
my
wants
always
masked
completely
ever
silent
that
i
was
not
entirely
separated
from
mankind
however
i
felt
assured
for
occasionally
sounds
of
voices
came
to
me
from
without
once
i
ventured
to
shout
aloud
hoping
to
attract
attention
but
the
persons
whom
i
felt
assured
overheard
me
paid
no
attention
to
my
lonely
cry
at
last
one
night
my
door
opened
abruptly
and
three
men
entered
do
not
fear
said
their
spokesman
we
aim
to
protect
you
keep
still
and
soon
you
will
be
a
free
man
i
consented
quietly
to
accompany
them
for
to
refuse
would
have
been
in
vain
and
i
was
conducted
to
a
boat
which
i
found
contained
a
corpse
the
one
i
had
journeyed
with
i
suppose
and
embarking
we
were
silently
rowed
to
the
middle
of
the
river
our
course
being
diagonally
from
the
shore
and
the
dead
man
was
thrown
overboard
then
our
boat
returned
to
the
desolate
bank
thrusting
me
into
a
carriage
that
on
our
return
to
the
river
bank
we
found
awaiting
us
my
captors
gave
a
signal
and
i
was
driven
away
in
the
darkness
as
silently
as
before
and
our
journey
was
continued
i
believe
for
fully
two
days
i
was
again
confined
in
another
log
cabin
with
but
one
door
and
destitute
of
windows
my
attendants
were
masked
they
neither
spoke
to
me
as
they
day
after
day
supplied
my
wants
nor
did
they
give
me
the
least
information
on
any
subject
until
at
last
i
abandoned
all
hope
of
ever
regaining
my
liberty

the
dead
man
was
thrown
overboard
chapter
vii
a
wild
i
am
prematurely
aged
in
the
depths
of
night
i
was
awakened
by
a
noise
made
by
the
opening
of
a
door
and
one
by
one
seven
masked
figures
silently
stalked
into
my
prison
each
bore
a
lighted
torch
and
they
passed
me
as
i
lay
on
the
floor
in
my
clothes
for
i
had
no
bedding
and
ranged
themselves
in
a
line
i
arose
and
seated
myself
as
directed
to
do
upon
the
only
stool
in
the
room
swinging
into
a
the
weird
line
wound
about
me
and
from
the
one
seat
on
which
i
rested
in
the
center
of
the
room
i
gazed
successively
upon
seven
pairs
of
gleaming
eyes
each
pair
directed
at
myself
and
as
i
turned
from
one
to
another
the
black
cowl
of
each
deepened
into
darkness
and
grew
more
hideous
men
or
devils
i
cried
do
your
worst
make
me
if
such
is
your
will
as
that
sunken
corpse
beside
which
i
was
once
seated
but
cease
your
persecutions
i
have
atoned
for
my
indiscretions
a
thousand
fold
and
this
suspense
is
unbearable
i
demand
to
know
what
is
to
be
my
doom
and
i
desire
its
fulfilment
then
one
stepped
forward
facing
me
squarely
the
others
closed
together
around
him
and
me
raising
his
forefinger
he
pointed
it
close
to
my
face
and
as
his
sharp
eyes
glittered
from
behind
the
black
mask
piercing
through
me
he
slowly
said
why
do
you
not
say
brothers
horrible
i
rejoined
stop
this
mockery
have
i
not
suffered
enough
from
your
persecutions
to
make
me
reject
that
word
as
applied
to
yourselves
you
can
but
murder
do
your
duty
to
your
unseen
masters
and
end
this
prolonged
torture
brother
said
the
spokesman
you
well
know
that
the
sacred
rules
of
our
order
will
not
permit
us
to
murder
any
human
being
we
exist
to
benefit
humanity
to
lead
the
wayward
back
across
the
burning
desert
into
the
pathways
of
the
righteous
not
to
destroy
or
persecute
a
brother
ours
is
an
eleemosynary
institution
instructing
its
members
helping
them
to
seek
happiness
you
are
now
expiating
the
crime
you
have
committed
and
the
good
in
your
spirit
rightfully
revolts
against
the
bad
for
in
divulging
to
the
world
our
mystic
signs
and
brotherly
greetings
you
have
sinned
against
yourself
more
than
against
others
the
sting
of
conscience
the
bitings
of
remorse
punish
you
true
i
cried
as
the
full
significance
of
what
he
said
burst
upon
me
too
true
but
i
bitterly
repent
my
treachery
others
can
never
know
how
my
soul
is
harrowed
by
the
recollection
of
the
enormity
of
that
breach
of
confidence
in
spite
of
my
open
careless
or
defiant
bearing
my
heart
is
humble
and
my
spirit
cries
out
for
mercy
by
night
and
by
day
i
have
in
secret
cursed
myself
for
heeding
an
unhallowed
mandate
and
i
have
long
looked
forward
to
the
judgment
that
i
should
suffer
for
my
perfidy
for
i
have
appreciated
that
the
day
of
reckoning
would
surely
appear
i
do
not
rebel
and
i
recall
my
wild
language
i
recant
my
i
renounce
myself
i
say
to
you
in
all
sincerity
brothers
do
your
duty
only
i
beg
of
you
to
slay
me
at
once
and
end
my
suspense
i
await
my
doom
what
might
it
be
grasping
my
hand
the
leader
said
you
are
ready
as
a
member
of
our
order
we
can
now
judge
you
as
we
have
been
commanded
had
you
persisted
in
calling
us
devils
in
your
mistaken
frenzy
we
should
have
been
forced
to
reason
with
you
until
you
returned
again
to
us
and
became
one
of
us
our
judgment
is
for
you
only
the
world
must
not
now
know
its
nature
at
least
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
those
you
see
here
are
not
your
judges
we
are
agents
sent
to
labor
with
you
to
draw
you
back
into
our
ranks
to
bring
you
into
a
condition
that
will
enable
you
to
carry
out
the
sentence
that
you
have
drawn
upon
yourself
for
you
must
be
your
own
doomsman
in
the
first
place
we
are
directed
to
gain
your
voluntary
consent
to
leave
this
locality
you
can
no
longer
take
part
in
affairs
that
interested
you
before
to
the
people
of
this
state
and
to
your
home
and
kindred
you
must
become
a
stranger
for
all
time
do
you
consent
yes
i
answered
for
i
knew
that
i
must
acquiesce
in
the
next
place
you
must
help
us
to
remove
all
traces
of
your
identity
you
must
so
far
as
the
world
is
concerned
leave
your
body
where
you
have
apparently
been
drowned
for
a
world
benefit
a
harmless
mockery
to
deceive
the
people
and
also
to
make
an
example
for
others
that
are
weak
are
you
ready
yes
then
remove
your
clothing
and
replace
it
with
this
suit
i
obeyed
and
changed
my
garments
receiving
others
in
return
one
of
the
party
then
taking
from
beneath
his
gown
a
box
containing
several
bottles
of
liquids
proceeded
artfully
to
mix
and
compound
them
and
then
to
paint
my
face
with
the
combination
which
after
being
mixed
formed
a
clear
solution
do
not
fear
to
wash
said
the
spokesman
the
effect
of
this
lotion
is
permanent
enough
to
stay
until
you
are
well
out
of
this
state
i
passed
my
hand
over
my
face
it
was
drawn
into
wrinkles
as
a
film
of
gelatine
might
have
been
shrivelled
under
the
influence
of
a
strong
tannin
or
astringent
liquid
beneath
my
fingers
it
felt
like
the
furrowed
face
of
a
very
old
man
but
i
experienced
no
pain
i
vainly
tried
to
smooth
the
wrinkles
immediately
upon
removing
the
pressure
of
my
hand
the
furrows
reappeared
next
another
applied
a
colorless
liquid
freely
to
my
hair
and
beard
he
rubbed
it
well
and
afterward
wiped
it
dry
with
a
towel
a
mirror
was
thrust
beneath
my
gaze
i
started
back
the
transformation
was
complete
my
appearance
had
entirely
changed
my
face
had
become
aged
and
wrinkled
my
hair
as
white
as
snow
i
cried
aloud
in
amazement
am
i
sane
is
this
a
dream
it
is
not
a
dream
but
under
methods
that
are
in
exact
accordance
with
natural
physiological
laws
we
have
been
enabled
to
transform
your
appearance
from
that
of
one
in
the
prime
of
manhood
into
the
semblance
of
an
old
man
and
that
too
without
impairment
of
your
vitality
another
of
the
masked
men
opened
a
curious
little
casket
that
i
perceived
was
surmounted
by
an
alembic
and
other
alchemical
figures
and
embossed
with
an
oriental
design
he
drew
from
it
a
lamp
which
he
lighted
with
a
taper
the
flame
that
resulted
first
pale
blue
then
yellow
next
violet
and
finally
red
seemed
to
become
more
weird
and
ghastly
with
each
mutation
as
i
gazed
upon
its
fantastic
changes
then
after
these
transformations
it
burned
steadily
with
the
final
strange
hue
and
he
now
held
over
the
blaze
a
tiny
cup
which
in
a
few
moments
commenced
to
sputter
and
then
smoked
exhaling
a
curious
epipolic
vapor
i
was
commanded
to
inhale
the
vapor
illustration
a
mirror
was
thrust
beneath
my
gaze
i
hesitated
the
thought
rushed
upon
me
now
i
am
another
person
so
cleverly
disguised
that
even
my
own
friends
would
perhaps
not
know
me
this
vapor
is
designed
to
suffocate
me
and
my
body
if
found
will
not
now
be
known
and
could
not
be
identified
when
discovered
do
not
fear
said
the
spokesman
as
if
divining
my
thought
there
is
no
danger
and
at
once
i
realized
by
quick
reasoning
that
if
my
death
were
demanded
my
body
might
long
since
have
been
easily
destroyed
and
all
this
ceremony
would
have
been
unnecessary
i
hesitated
no
longer
but
drew
into
my
lungs
the
vapor
that
arose
from
the
mysterious
cup
freely
expanding
my
chest
several
times
and
then
asked
is
not
that
enough
despair
now
overcame
me
my
voice
no
longer
the
full
strong
tone
of
a
man
in
middle
life
and
perfect
strength
squeaked
and
quavered
as
if
impaired
by
palsy
i
had
seen
my
image
in
a
mirror
an
old
man
with
wrinkled
face
and
white
hair
i
now
heard
myself
speak
with
the
voice
of
an
octogenarian
what
have
you
done
i
cried
we
have
obeyed
your
orders
you
told
us
you
were
ready
to
leave
your
own
self
here
and
the
work
is
complete
the
man
who
entered
has
disappeared
if
you
should
now
stand
in
the
streets
of
your
village
home
and
cry
to
your
former
friends
is
i
for
whom
you
seek
they
would
smile
and
call
you
a
madman
know
continued
the
voice
that
there
is
in
eastern
metaphysical
lore
more
true
philosophy
than
is
embodied
in
the
sciences
of
and
that
by
means
of
the
ramifications
of
our
order
it
becomes
possible
when
necessary
for
him
who
stands
beyond
the
inner
and
upper
worshipful
master
to
draw
these
treasures
from
the
occult
wisdom
possessions
of
oriental
sages
who
forget
nothing
and
lose
nothing
have
we
not
been
permitted
to
do
his
bidding
well
yes
i
squeaked
and
i
wish
that
you
had
done
it
better
i
would
that
i
were
dead
when
the
time
comes
if
necessary
your
dead
body
will
be
fished
from
the
water
was
the
reply
witnesses
have
seen
the
drowning
tragedy
and
will
surely
identify
the
corpse
and
may
i
go
am
i
free
now
i
asked
ah
said
he
that
is
not
for
us
to
say
our
part
of
the
work
is
fulfilled
and
we
can
return
to
our
native
lands
and
resume
again
our
several
studies
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
you
are
free
but
we
have
been
directed
to
pass
you
over
to
the
keeping
of
others
who
will
carry
forward
this
judgment
there
is
another
step
tell
me
i
cried
once
more
desponding
tell
me
the
full
extent
of
my
sentence
that
is
not
known
to
us
and
probably
is
not
known
to
any
one
man
so
far
as
the
members
of
our
order
are
concerned
you
have
now
vanished
when
you
leave
our
sight
this
night
we
will
also
separate
from
one
another
we
shall
know
no
more
of
you
and
your
future
than
will
those
of
our
working
order
who
live
in
this
section
of
the
country
we
have
no
personal
acquaintance
with
the
guide
that
has
been
selected
to
conduct
you
farther
and
who
will
appear
in
due
season
and
we
make
no
surmise
concerning
the
result
of
your
journey
only
we
know
that
you
will
not
be
killed
for
you
have
a
work
to
perform
and
will
continue
to
exist
long
after
others
of
your
age
are
dead
farewell
brother
we
have
discharged
our
duty
and
by
your
consent
now
we
must
return
to
our
various
pursuits
in
a
short
time
all
evidence
of
your
unfortunate
mistake
the
crime
committed
by
you
in
printing
our
sacred
charges
will
have
vanished
even
now
emissaries
are
ordained
to
collect
and
destroy
the
written
record
that
tells
of
your
weakness
and
with
the
destruction
of
that
testimony
for
every
copy
will
surely
be
annihilated
and
with
your
disappearance
from
among
men
for
this
also
is
to
follow
our
responsibility
for
you
will
cease
each
of
the
seven
men
advanced
and
grasped
my
hand
giving
me
the
grip
of
brotherhood
and
then
without
a
word
they
severally
and
silently
departed
into
the
outer
darkness
as
the
last
man
disappeared
a
figure
entered
the
door
clad
and
masked
exactly
like
those
who
had
gone
he
removed
the
long
black
gown
in
which
he
was
enveloped
threw
the
mask
from
his
face
and
stood
before
me
a
slender
graceful
young
man
by
the
light
of
the
candle
i
saw
him
distinctly
and
was
at
once
struck
by
his
amiable
cheerful
countenance
and
my
heart
bounded
with
a
sudden
hope
i
had
temporarily
forgotten
the
transformation
that
had
been
made
in
my
person
which
altogether
painless
had
left
no
physical
sensation
and
thought
of
myself
as
i
had
formerly
existed
my
soul
was
still
my
own
i
imagined
my
blood
seemed
unchanged
and
must
flow
as
rapidly
as
before
my
strength
was
unaltered
indeed
i
was
in
still
in
the
prime
of
life
excuse
me
father
said
the
stranger
but
my
services
have
been
sought
as
a
guide
for
the
first
part
of
a
journey
that
i
am
informed
you
intend
to
take
his
voice
was
mild
and
pleasant
his
bearing
respectful
but
the
peculiar
manner
in
which
he
spoke
convinced
me
that
he
knew
that
as
a
guide
he
must
conduct
me
to
some
previously
designated
spot
and
that
he
purposed
to
do
so
was
evident
with
or
without
my
consent
why
do
you
call
me
father
i
attempted
to
say
but
as
the
first
few
words
escaped
my
lips
the
recollection
of
the
events
of
the
night
rushed
upon
me
for
instead
of
my
own
i
recognized
the
piping
voice
of
the
old
man
i
had
now
become
and
my
tongue
faltered
the
sentence
was
unspoken
you
would
ask
me
why
i
called
you
father
i
perceive
well
because
i
am
directed
to
be
a
son
to
you
to
care
for
your
wants
to
make
your
journey
as
easy
and
pleasant
as
possible
to
guide
you
quietly
and
carefully
to
the
point
that
will
next
prove
of
interest
to
you
i
stood
before
him
a
free
man
in
the
prime
of
life
full
of
energy
and
this
stripling
alone
interposed
between
myself
and
liberty
should
i
permit
the
slender
youth
to
carry
me
away
as
a
prisoner
would
it
not
be
best
to
thrust
him
aside
if
necessary
crush
him
to
the
earth
go
forth
in
my
freedom
yet
i
hesitated
for
he
might
have
friends
outside
probably
he
was
not
alone
there
are
no
companions
near
us
said
he
reading
my
mind
and
as
i
do
not
seem
formidable
it
is
natural
you
should
weigh
in
your
mind
the
probabilities
of
escape
but
you
can
not
evade
your
destiny
and
you
must
not
attempt
to
deny
yourself
the
pleasure
of
my
company
you
must
leave
this
locality
and
leave
without
a
regret
in
order
that
you
may
acquiesce
willingly
i
propose
that
together
we
return
to
your
former
home
which
you
will
however
find
no
longer
to
be
a
home
i
will
accompany
you
as
a
companion
as
your
son
you
may
speak
with
one
exception
to
whomever
you
care
to
address
may
call
on
any
of
your
old
associates
may
assert
openly
who
you
are
or
whatever
and
whoever
you
please
to
represent
yourself
only
i
must
also
have
the
privilege
of
joining
in
the
conversation
agreed
i
cried
and
extended
my
hand
he
grasped
it
and
then
by
the
light
of
the
candle
i
saw
a
peculiar
expression
flit
over
his
face
as
he
added
to
one
person
only
as
i
have
said
and
you
have
promised
you
must
not
speak
your
wife
i
bowed
my
head
and
a
flood
of
sorrowful
reflections
swept
over
me
of
all
the
world
the
one
whom
i
longed
to
meet
to
clasp
in
my
arms
to
counsel
in
my
distress
was
the
wife
of
my
bosom
and
i
begged
him
to
withdraw
his
cruel
injunction
you
should
have
thought
of
her
before
now
it
is
too
late
to
permit
you
to
meet
and
speak
with
her
would
be
dangerous
she
might
pierce
your
disguise
of
all
others
there
is
no
fear
must
i
go
with
you
into
an
unknown
future
without
a
farewell
kiss
from
my
little
child
or
from
my
babe
scarce
three
months
old
it
has
been
so
ordained
i
threw
myself
on
the
floor
and
moaned
this
is
too
hard
too
hard
for
human
heart
to
bear
life
has
no
charm
to
a
man
who
is
thrust
from
all
he
holds
most
dear
home
friends
family
the
men
who
relinquish
such
pleasures
and
such
comforts
are
those
who
do
the
greatest
good
to
humanity
said
the
youth
the
multitude
exist
to
propagate
the
race
as
animal
progenitors
of
the
multitudes
that
are
to
follow
and
the
exceptional
philanthropist
is
he
who
denies
himself
material
bliss
and
punishes
himself
in
order
to
work
out
a
problem
such
as
it
has
been
ordained
that
you
are
to
solve
do
not
argue
further
the
line
is
marked
and
you
must
walk
direct
into
the
blaze
of
the
old
fireplace
of
that
log
house
for
although
it
was
autumn
the
night
was
chilly
he
then
cast
his
black
robe
and
false
face
and
as
they
turned
to
ashes
the
last
evidences
of
the
vivid
acts
through
which
i
had
passed
were
destroyed
as
i
lay
moaning
in
my
utter
misery
i
tried
to
reason
with
myself
that
what
i
experienced
was
all
a
hallucination
i
dozed
and
awoke
startled
half
conscious
only
as
one
in
a
nightmare
i
said
to
myself
a
dream
a
dream
and
slept
again
chapter
viii
a
lesson
in
mind
study
the
door
of
the
cabin
was
open
when
i
awoke
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
my
friend
apparently
happy
and
unconcerned
said
father
we
must
soon
start
on
our
journey
i
have
taken
advantage
of
your
refreshing
sleep
and
have
engaged
breakfast
at
yonder
our
meal
awaits
us
i
arose
washed
my
wrinkled
face
combed
my
white
hair
and
shuddered
as
i
saw
in
a
pocket
mirror
the
reflection
of
my
figure
an
aged
apparently
decrepit
man
do
not
be
disturbed
at
your
feeble
condition
said
my
companion
your
infirmities
are
not
real
few
men
have
ever
been
permitted
to
drink
of
the
richness
of
the
revelations
that
await
you
and
in
view
of
these
expectations
the
fact
that
you
are
prematurely
aged
in
appearance
should
not
unnerve
you
be
of
good
heart
and
when
you
say
the
word
we
will
start
on
our
journey
which
will
begin
as
soon
as
you
have
said
farewell
to
former
friends
and
acquaintances
i
made
no
reply
but
silently
accompanied
him
for
my
thoughts
were
in
the
past
and
my
reflections
were
far
from
pleasant
we
reached
the
and
as
i
observed
the
care
and
attention
extended
me
by
the
housewife
i
realized
that
in
one
respect
at
least
old
age
brought
its
compensation
after
breakfast
a
man
appeared
from
the
farmer
barn
driving
a
team
of
horses
attached
to
an
open
which
in
obedience
to
the
request
of
my
guide
i
entered
accompanied
by
my
young
friend
who
directed
that
we
be
driven
toward
the
village
from
which
i
had
been
abducted
he
seemed
to
know
my
past
life
as
i
knew
it
he
asked
me
to
select
those
of
my
friends
to
whom
i
first
wished
to
bid
farewell
even
mentioning
their
names
he
seemed
all
that
a
patient
faithful
son
could
be
and
i
began
to
wonder
at
his
audacity
even
as
much
as
i
admired
his
as
we
journeyed
onward
we
engaged
in
familiar
talk
we
sat
together
on
the
back
seat
of
the
open
in
full
sight
of
passers
no
attempt
being
made
to
conceal
my
person
thus
we
traveled
for
two
days
and
on
our
course
we
passed
through
a
large
city
with
which
i
was
acquainted
a
city
that
my
abductors
had
previously
carried
me
through
and
beyond
i
found
that
my
son
possessed
fine
conversational
power
and
a
rich
mine
of
information
and
he
became
increasingly
interesting
as
he
drew
from
his
fund
of
knowledge
and
poured
into
my
listening
ears
an
entrancing
strain
of
historical
and
metaphysical
information
never
at
a
loss
for
a
word
or
an
idea
he
appeared
to
discern
my
cogitations
and
as
my
mind
wandered
in
this
or
that
direction
he
fell
into
the
channel
of
my
fancies
and
answered
my
unspoken
thoughts
my
or
meditations
as
pertinently
as
though
i
had
spoken
them
his
accomplishments
for
the
methods
of
his
perception
were
unaccompanied
by
any
endeavor
to
draw
me
into
word
expression
made
me
aware
at
least
that
in
him
i
had
to
deal
with
a
man
unquestionably
possessed
of
more
than
ordinary
intellect
and
education
and
as
this
conviction
entered
my
mind
he
changed
his
subject
and
promptly
answered
the
silent
inquiry
speaking
as
follows
have
you
not
sometimes
felt
that
in
yourself
there
may
exist
undeveloped
senses
that
await
an
awakening
touch
to
open
to
yourself
a
new
world
senses
that
may
be
fully
developed
but
which
saturate
each
other
and
neutralize
themselves
quiescent
closed
circles
which
you
can
not
reach
satisfied
circuits
slumbering
within
your
body
and
that
defy
your
efforts
to
utilize
them
in
your
dreams
have
you
not
seen
sights
that
words
are
inadequate
to
describe
that
your
faculties
can
not
retain
in
waking
moments
and
which
dissolve
into
intangible
nothingness
leaving
only
a
vague
shadowy
outline
as
the
mind
quickens
or
rather
when
the
senses
that
possess
you
in
sleep
relinquish
the
body
to
the
returning
vital
functions
and
spirit
this
unconscious
conception
of
other
planes
a
beyond
or
betwixt
that
is
neither
mental
nor
material
neither
here
nor
located
elsewhere
belongs
to
humanity
in
general
and
is
made
evident
from
the
unsatiable
desire
of
men
to
pry
into
phenomena
latent
or
recondite
that
offer
no
apparent
return
to
humanity
this
desire
has
given
men
the
knowledge
they
now
possess
of
the
sciences
sciences
yet
in
their
infancy
study
in
this
direction
is
at
present
altogether
of
the
material
plane
but
in
time
to
come
men
will
gain
control
of
outlying
senses
which
will
enable
them
to
step
from
the
seen
into
the
consideration
of
matter
or
force
that
is
now
subtle
and
evasive
which
must
be
accomplished
by
means
of
the
latent
faculties
that
i
have
indicated
there
will
be
an
unconscious
development
of
new
in
the
student
of
nature
as
the
rudiments
of
these
sciences
are
elaborated
step
by
step
as
the
ages
pass
the
faculties
of
men
will
under
progressive
series
of
evolutions
imperceptibly
pass
into
higher
phases
until
that
which
is
even
now
possible
with
some
individuals
of
the
purified
esoteric
school
but
which
would
seem
miraculous
if
practiced
openly
at
this
day
will
prove
feasible
to
humanity
generally
and
be
found
in
exact
accord
with
natural
laws
the
conversational
method
of
men
whereby
communion
between
human
beings
is
carried
on
by
disturbing
the
air
by
means
of
vocal
organs
so
as
to
produce
mechanical
pulsations
of
that
medium
is
crude
in
the
extreme
mind
craves
to
meet
mind
but
can
not
yet
thrust
matter
aside
and
in
order
to
communicate
one
with
another
the
impression
one
mind
wishes
to
convey
to
another
must
be
first
made
on
the
brain
matter
that
accompanies
it
which
in
turn
influences
the
organs
of
speech
inducing
a
disturbance
of
the
air
by
the
motions
of
the
vocal
organs
which
by
undulations
that
reach
to
another
being
act
on
his
ear
and
secondarily
on
the
earthly
matter
of
his
brain
and
finally
by
this
roundabout
course
impress
the
second
being
mind
in
this
transmission
of
motions
there
is
great
waste
of
energy
and
loss
of
time
but
such
methods
are
a
necessity
of
the
present
slow
method
of
communication
there
is
in
cultivated
man
an
innate
craving
for
something
more
facile
and
often
a
partly
developed
conception
spectral
and
vague
appears
and
the
being
feels
that
there
may
be
for
mortals
a
richer
brighter
life
a
higher
earthly
existence
that
science
does
not
now
indicate
such
intimation
of
a
deeper
play
of
faculties
is
now
most
vivid
with
men
during
the
perfect
loss
of
mental
self
as
experienced
in
dreams
which
as
yet
man
in
the
quick
can
not
grasp
and
which
fade
as
he
awakens
as
mental
sciences
are
developed
investigators
will
find
that
the
medium
known
as
air
is
unnecessary
as
a
means
of
conveying
mind
conceptions
from
one
person
to
another
that
material
sounds
and
word
pulsations
are
cumbersome
that
thought
force
unexpressed
may
be
used
to
accomplish
more
than
speech
can
do
and
that
physical
exertions
as
exemplified
in
motion
of
matter
such
as
i
have
described
will
be
unnecessary
for
mental
communication
as
door
after
door
in
these
directions
shall
open
before
men
mystery
after
mystery
will
be
disclosed
and
vanish
as
mysteries
to
reappear
as
simple
facts
phenomena
that
are
impossible
and
unrevealed
to
the
scientist
of
will
be
familiar
to
the
coming
multitude
and
at
last
as
by
degrees
clearer
knowledge
is
evolved
the
vocal
language
of
men
will
disappear
and
humanity
regardless
of
nationality
will
in
silence
and
even
in
darkness
converse
eloquently
together
in
mind
language
that
which
is
now
esoteric
will
become
exoteric
then
mind
will
meet
mind
as
my
mind
now
impinges
on
your
own
and
in
reply
to
your
unuttered
question
regarding
my
apparently
unaccountable
powers
of
perception
i
say
they
are
perfectly
natural
but
while
i
can
read
your
thoughts
because
of
the
fact
that
you
can
not
reciprocate
in
this
direction
i
must
use
my
voice
to
impress
your
mind
you
will
know
more
of
this
however
at
a
future
day
for
it
has
been
ordained
that
you
are
to
be
educated
with
an
object
that
is
now
concealed
at
present
you
are
interested
mainly
in
the
affairs
of
life
as
you
know
them
and
can
not
enter
into
these
purer
spheres
we
are
approaching
one
of
your
former
friends
and
it
may
be
your
pleasure
to
ask
him
some
questions
and
to
bid
him
farewell
chapter
ix
i
can
not
establish
my
identity
in
surprise
i
perceived
coming
towards
us
a
light
spring
wagon
in
which
rode
one
of
my
old
acquaintances
pleasure
at
the
discovery
led
me
to
raise
my
hat
wave
it
around
my
head
and
salute
him
even
at
the
considerable
distance
that
then
separated
us
i
was
annoyed
at
the
look
of
curiosity
that
passed
over
his
countenance
and
not
until
the
two
vehicles
had
stopped
side
by
side
did
it
occur
to
me
that
i
was
unrecognized
i
had
been
so
engrossed
in
my
companion
revelations
that
i
had
forgotten
my
unfortunate
physical
condition
i
stretched
out
my
hand
i
leaned
over
almost
into
the
other
vehicle
and
earnestly
said
do
you
not
know
me
only
a
short
time
ago
we
sat
and
conversed
side
by
side
a
look
of
bewilderment
came
over
his
features
i
have
never
seen
you
that
i
can
recall
he
answered
my
spirit
sank
within
me
could
it
be
possible
that
i
was
really
so
changed
i
begged
him
to
try
and
recall
my
former
self
giving
my
name
i
am
that
person
i
added
but
he
with
an
expression
of
countenance
that
told
as
plainly
as
words
could
speak
that
he
considered
me
deranged
touched
his
horse
and
drove
on
my
companion
broke
the
awkward
silence
do
you
know
that
i
perceived
between
you
two
men
an
unconscious
display
of
especially
evident
on
your
part
you
wished
with
all
the
earnestness
of
your
soul
to
bring
yourself
as
you
formerly
appeared
before
that
man
and
when
it
proved
impossible
without
a
word
from
him
his
mind
exhibited
itself
to
your
more
earnest
intellect
and
you
realized
that
he
said
to
himself
person
is
a
poor
lunatic
he
told
you
his
thoughts
in
as
plainly
as
words
could
have
spoken
because
the
intense
earnestness
on
your
part
quickened
your
perceptive
faculties
but
he
could
not
see
your
mental
state
and
the
pleading
voice
of
the
apparent
stranger
before
him
could
not
convince
the
unconcerned
lethargic
mind
within
him
i
observed
however
in
addition
to
what
you
noticed
that
he
is
really
looking
for
you
that
is
the
object
of
his
journey
and
i
learn
that
in
every
direction
men
are
now
spreading
the
news
that
you
have
been
kidnapped
and
carried
from
your
jail
however
we
shall
soon
be
in
the
village
and
you
will
then
hear
more
about
yourself
we
rode
in
silence
while
i
meditated
on
my
remarkable
situation
i
could
not
resign
myself
without
a
struggle
to
my
approaching
fate
and
i
felt
even
yet
a
hope
although
i
seemed
powerless
in
the
hands
of
destiny
could
i
not
by
some
method
convince
my
friends
of
my
identity
i
determined
forgetting
the
fact
that
my
guide
was
even
then
reading
my
mind
that
upon
the
next
opportunity
i
would
pursue
a
different
course
it
will
not
avail
my
companion
replied
you
must
do
one
of
two
things
you
will
voluntarily
go
with
me
or
you
will
involuntarily
go
to
an
insane
asylum
neither
you
nor
i
could
by
any
method
convince
others
that
the
obviously
decrepit
old
man
beside
me
was
but
yesterday
hale
hearty
young
and
strong
you
will
find
that
you
can
not
prove
your
identity
and
as
a
friend
one
of
the
great
brotherhood
to
which
you
belong
a
craft
that
deals
charitably
with
all
men
and
all
problems
i
advise
you
to
accept
the
situation
as
soon
as
possible
after
it
becomes
evident
to
your
mind
that
you
are
lost
to
former
affiliations
and
must
henceforth
be
a
stranger
to
the
people
whom
you
know
take
my
advice
and
cease
to
regret
the
past
and
cheerfully
turn
your
thoughts
to
the
future
on
one
side
of
you
the
lunatic
asylum
is
open
on
the
other
a
journey
into
an
unknown
region
beyond
the
confines
of
any
known
country
on
the
one
hand
imprisonment
and
subjection
perhaps
abuse
and
neglect
on
the
other
liberation
of
soul
evolution
of
faculty
and
a
grasping
of
superior
knowledge
that
is
denied
most
men
yes
withheld
from
all
but
a
few
persons
of
each
generation
for
only
a
few
unknown
to
the
millions
of
this
world
inhabitants
have
passed
over
the
road
you
are
to
travel
just
now
you
wished
to
meet
your
jailer
of
a
few
hours
ago
it
is
a
wise
conclusion
and
if
he
does
not
recognize
you
i
ask
in
sincerity
who
will
be
likely
to
do
so
we
will
drive
straight
to
his
home
but
here
he
comes
indeed
we
were
now
in
the
village
where
my
miserable
journey
began
and
perhaps
by
chance
it
seems
that
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
my
former
jailer
actually
approached
us
if
you
please
said
my
companion
i
will
assist
you
to
alight
from
the
wagon
and
you
may
privately
converse
with
him
our
wagon
stopped
my
guide
opened
a
conversation
with
the
jailer
saying
that
his
friend
wished
to
speak
with
him
and
then
assisted
me
to
alight
and
retired
a
distance
i
was
vexed
at
my
infirmities
which
embarrassed
me
most
exasperatingly
but
which
i
knew
were
artificial
my
body
appeared
unwilling
although
my
spirit
was
anxious
but
do
what
i
could
to
control
my
actions
i
involuntarily
behaved
like
a
decrepit
old
man
however
my
mind
was
made
up
this
attempt
to
prove
my
personality
should
be
the
last
failure
now
would
prove
the
turning
point
and
i
would
go
willingly
with
my
companion
upon
the
unknown
journey
if
i
could
not
convince
the
jailer
of
my
identity
straightening
myself
before
the
expectant
jailer
who
with
a
look
of
inquisitiveness
regarded
me
as
a
stranger
i
asked
if
he
knew
my
former
self
giving
my
name
that
i
do
he
replied
and
if
i
could
find
him
at
this
moment
i
would
be
relieved
of
a
load
of
worry
would
you
surely
know
him
if
you
met
him
i
asked
assuredly
he
replied
and
if
you
bring
tidings
of
his
whereabouts
as
your
bearing
indicates
speak
that
i
may
rid
myself
of
suspicion
and
suspense
calling
the
jailer
by
name
i
asked
him
if
my
countenance
did
not
remind
him
of
the
man
he
wished
to
find
not
at
all
listen
does
not
my
voice
resemble
that
of
your
escaped
prisoner
not
in
the
least
illustration
i
am
the
man
you
seek
with
a
violent
effort
i
drew
my
form
as
straight
as
possible
and
stood
upright
before
him
with
every
facial
muscle
strained
to
its
utmost
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
bring
my
wrinkled
countenance
to
its
former
smoothness
and
with
the
energy
that
a
drowning
man
might
exert
to
grasp
a
passing
object
i
tried
to
control
my
voice
and
preserve
my
identity
by
so
doing
vehemently
imploring
him
begging
him
to
listen
to
my
story
i
am
the
man
you
seek
i
am
the
prisoner
who
a
few
days
ago
stood
in
the
prime
of
life
before
you
i
have
been
spirited
away
from
you
by
men
who
are
leagued
with
occult
forces
which
extend
forward
among
hidden
mysteries
into
forces
which
illuminate
the
present
and
reach
backward
into
the
past
unseen
these
persons
by
artful
and
damnable
manipulations
under
the
guidance
of
a
power
that
has
been
evolved
in
the
secrecy
of
past
ages
and
transmitted
only
to
a
favored
few
have
changed
the
strong
man
you
knew
into
the
one
apparently
feeble
who
now
confronts
you
only
a
short
period
has
passed
since
i
was
your
unwilling
captive
charged
with
debt
a
trifling
sum
and
then
as
your
sullen
prisoner
i
longed
for
freedom
now
i
plead
before
you
with
all
my
soul
i
beg
of
you
to
take
me
back
to
my
cell
seal
your
doors
and
hold
me
again
for
your
dungeon
will
now
be
to
me
a
paradise
i
felt
that
i
was
becoming
frantic
for
with
each
word
i
realized
that
the
jailer
became
more
and
more
impatient
and
annoyed
i
perceived
that
he
believed
me
to
be
a
lunatic
pleadings
and
entreaties
were
of
no
avail
and
my
eagerness
rapidly
changed
into
despair
until
at
last
i
cried
if
you
will
not
believe
my
words
i
will
throw
myself
on
the
mercy
of
my
young
companion
i
ask
you
to
consider
his
testimony
and
if
he
says
that
i
am
not
what
i
assert
myself
to
be
i
will
leave
my
home
and
country
and
go
with
him
quietly
into
the
unknown
future
he
turned
to
depart
but
i
threw
myself
before
him
and
beckoned
the
young
man
who
up
to
this
time
had
stood
aloof
in
respectful
silence
he
came
forward
and
addressing
the
jailer
called
him
by
name
and
corroborated
my
story
yes
strange
as
it
sounded
to
me
he
reiterated
the
substance
of
my
narrative
as
i
had
repeated
it
now
you
will
believe
it
i
cried
in
ecstacy
now
you
need
no
longer
question
the
facts
that
i
have
related
instead
however
of
accepting
the
story
of
the
witness
the
jailer
upbraided
him
this
is
a
preconcerted
arrangement
to
get
me
into
ridicule
or
further
trouble
you
two
have
made
up
an
incredible
story
that
on
its
face
is
fit
only
to
be
told
to
men
as
crazy
or
designing
as
yourselves
this
young
man
did
not
even
overhear
your
conversation
with
me
and
yet
he
repeats
his
lesson
without
a
question
from
me
as
to
what
i
wish
to
learn
of
him
he
can
see
our
minds
i
cried
in
despair
crazier
than
i
should
have
believed
from
your
countenance
the
jailer
replied
of
all
the
improbable
stories
imaginable
you
have
attempted
to
inveigle
me
into
accepting
that
which
is
most
unreasonable
if
you
are
leagued
together
intent
on
some
swindling
scheme
i
give
you
warning
now
that
i
am
in
no
mood
for
trifling
go
your
way
and
trouble
me
no
more
with
this
foolish
scheming
which
villainy
or
lunacy
of
some
description
must
underlie
he
turned
in
anger
and
left
us
it
is
as
i
predicted
said
my
companion
you
are
lost
to
man
those
who
know
you
best
will
turn
from
you
soonest
i
might
become
as
wild
as
you
are
in
your
interest
and
only
serve
to
make
your
story
appear
more
extravagant
in
human
affairs
men
judge
and
act
according
to
the
limited
knowledge
at
command
of
the
multitude
witnesses
who
tell
the
truth
are
often
in
our
courts
of
law
stunned
as
you
have
been
by
the
decisions
of
a
jury
men
sit
on
juries
with
little
conception
of
the
facts
of
the
case
that
is
brought
before
them
the
men
who
manipulate
them
are
mere
tools
in
unseen
hands
that
throw
their
several
minds
in
antagonisms
unexplainable
to
man
the
judge
is
unconsciously
often
a
tool
of
his
own
errors
or
those
of
others
one
learned
judge
unties
what
another
has
fastened
each
basing
his
views
on
the
same
testimony
each
rendering
his
decision
in
accordance
with
law
derived
from
the
same
authority
your
case
is
that
condition
of
mind
that
men
call
lunacy
you
can
see
much
that
is
hidden
from
others
because
you
have
become
acquainted
with
facts
that
their
narrow
education
forbids
them
to
accept
but
because
the
majority
is
against
you
they
consider
you
mentally
unbalanced
the
philosophy
of
men
does
not
yet
comprehend
the
conditions
that
have
operated
on
your
person
and
as
you
stand
alone
although
in
the
right
all
men
will
oppose
you
and
you
must
submit
to
the
views
of
a
misguided
majority
in
the
eyes
of
a
present
generation
you
are
crazy
a
jury
of
your
former
peers
could
not
do
else
than
so
adjudge
you
for
you
are
not
on
the
same
mental
plane
and
i
ask
will
you
again
attempt
to
accomplish
that
which
is
as
impossible
as
it
would
be
for
you
to
drink
the
waters
of
seneca
lake
at
one
draught
go
to
those
men
and
propose
to
drain
that
lake
at
one
gulp
and
you
will
be
listened
to
as
seriously
as
when
you
beg
your
former
comrades
to
believe
that
you
are
another
person
than
what
you
seem
only
lengthened
life
is
credited
with
the
production
of
physical
changes
that
under
favorable
conditions
are
possible
of
accomplishment
in
a
brief
period
and
such
testimony
as
you
could
bring
in
the
present
state
of
human
knowledge
would
only
add
to
the
proof
of
your
lunacy
i
see
i
see
i
said
and
i
submit
lead
on
i
am
ready
whatever
my
destined
career
may
be
wherever
it
may
be
it
can
only
lead
to
the
grave
do
not
be
so
sure
of
that
was
the
reply
i
shuddered
instinctively
for
this
answer
seemed
to
imply
that
the
stillness
of
the
grave
would
be
preferable
to
my
destiny
we
got
into
the
wagon
again
and
a
deep
silence
followed
as
we
rode
along
gazing
abstractedly
on
the
quiet
fields
and
lonely
finally
we
reached
a
little
village
here
my
companion
dismissed
the
farmer
our
driver
paying
him
liberally
and
secured
lodgings
in
a
private
family
i
believe
we
were
expected
and
after
a
hearty
supper
we
retired
from
the
time
we
left
the
jailer
i
never
again
attempted
to
reveal
my
identity
i
had
lost
my
interest
in
the
past
and
found
myself
craving
to
know
what
the
future
had
in
store
for
me
chapter
x
my
journey
towards
the
end
of
earth
the
brotherhood
my
companion
did
not
attempt
to
watch
over
my
motions
or
in
any
way
to
interfere
with
my
freedom
i
will
for
a
time
necessarily
be
absent
he
said
arranging
for
our
journey
and
while
i
am
getting
ready
you
must
employ
yourself
as
best
you
can
i
ask
you
however
now
to
swear
that
as
you
have
promised
you
will
not
seek
your
wife
and
children
to
this
i
agreed
hold
up
your
hand
he
said
and
i
repeated
after
him
all
this
i
most
solemnly
and
sincerely
promise
and
swear
with
a
firm
and
steadfast
resolution
to
keep
and
perform
my
oath
without
the
least
equivocation
mental
reservation
or
whatever
that
will
answer
see
that
you
keep
your
oath
this
time
he
said
and
he
departed
several
days
were
consumed
before
he
returned
and
during
that
time
i
was
an
inquisitive
and
silent
listener
to
the
various
conjectures
others
were
making
regarding
my
abduction
which
event
was
becoming
of
general
interest
some
of
the
theories
advanced
were
quite
near
the
truth
others
wild
and
erratic
how
preposterous
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
actor
himself
could
be
in
the
very
seat
of
the
disturbance
willing
anxious
to
testify
ready
to
prove
the
truth
concerning
his
position
and
yet
unable
even
to
obtain
a
respectful
hearing
from
those
most
interested
in
his
recovery
men
gathered
together
discussing
the
outrage
women
children
even
talked
of
little
else
and
it
was
evident
that
the
entire
country
was
aroused
new
political
issues
took
their
rise
from
the
event
but
the
man
who
was
the
prime
cause
of
the
excitement
was
for
a
period
a
willing
and
unwilling
listener
as
he
had
been
a
willing
and
unwilling
actor
in
the
tragedy
one
morning
my
companion
drove
up
in
a
light
carriage
drawn
by
a
span
of
fine
spirited
black
horses
we
are
ready
now
he
said
and
my
unprecedented
journey
began
wherever
we
stopped
i
heard
my
name
mentioned
men
combined
against
men
brother
was
declaiming
against
brother
neighbor
was
against
neighbor
everywhere
suspicion
was
in
the
air
the
passage
of
time
alone
can
quiet
these
people
said
i
the
usual
conception
of
the
term
time
an
indescribable
something
flowing
at
a
constant
rate
is
erroneous
replied
my
comrade
time
is
humanity
best
friend
and
should
be
pictured
as
a
ministering
angel
instead
of
a
skeleton
with
and
scythe
time
does
not
fly
but
is
permanent
and
quiescent
while
restless
matter
rushes
onward
force
and
matter
fly
time
reposes
at
our
birth
we
are
wound
up
like
a
machine
to
move
for
a
certain
number
of
years
grating
against
time
we
grind
against
that
complacent
spirit
and
wear
not
time
but
ourselves
away
we
hold
within
ourselves
a
certain
amount
of
energy
which
an
evanescent
form
of
matter
is
the
opponent
of
time
time
has
no
existence
with
inanimate
objects
it
is
a
conception
of
the
human
intellect
time
is
rest
perfect
rest
tranquillity
such
as
man
never
realizes
unless
he
becomes
a
part
of
the
sweet
silences
toward
which
human
life
and
human
mind
are
drifting
so
much
for
time
now
for
life
disturbed
energy
in
one
of
its
forms
we
call
life
and
this
life
is
the
great
enemy
of
peace
the
opponent
of
steadfast
perfection
pure
energy
the
soul
of
the
universe
permeates
all
things
with
which
man
is
now
acquainted
but
when
at
rest
is
imperceptible
to
man
while
disturbed
energy
according
to
its
condition
is
apparent
either
as
matter
or
as
force
a
substance
or
material
body
is
a
manifestation
resulting
from
a
disturbance
of
energy
the
agitating
cause
removed
the
manifestations
disappear
and
thus
a
universe
may
be
extinguished
without
unbalancing
the
cosmos
that
remains
the
worlds
known
to
man
are
conditions
of
abnormal
energy
moving
on
separate
planes
through
what
men
call
space
they
attract
to
themselves
bodies
of
similar
description
and
thus
influence
one
another
they
have
each
a
separate
existence
and
are
swayed
to
and
fro
under
the
influence
of
the
various
disturbances
in
energy
common
to
their
rank
or
order
which
we
call
forms
of
forces
unsettled
energy
also
assumes
numerous
other
expressions
that
are
unknown
to
man
but
which
in
all
perceptible
forms
is
characterized
by
motion
pure
energy
can
not
be
appreciated
by
the
minds
of
mortals
there
are
invisible
worlds
besides
those
perceived
by
us
in
our
planetary
system
unreachable
centers
of
ethereal
structure
about
us
that
stand
in
a
higher
plane
of
development
than
earthly
matter
which
is
a
gross
form
of
disturbed
energy
there
are
also
lower
planes
acquaintance
with
the
forms
of
energy
is
the
result
of
his
power
of
perceiving
the
forms
of
matter
of
which
he
is
a
part
heat
light
gravitation
electricity
and
magnetism
are
ever
present
in
all
perceivable
substances
and
although
purer
than
earth
they
are
still
manifestations
of
absolute
energy
and
for
this
reason
are
sensible
to
men
but
more
evanescent
than
material
bodies
perhaps
you
can
conceive
that
if
these
disturbances
could
be
removed
matter
or
force
would
be
resolved
back
into
pure
energy
and
would
vanish
such
a
dissociation
is
an
ethereal
existence
and
as

of

and
their

with

in

beyond
you
are
not

in

position
properly
to
judge

before
many
years
a
new

will
be
given
you
or
a

of
latent

by
the
removal
of
those
more
gross
and
a
partial
insight
into
an
unsuspected
unseen
into
a
realm
to
you
at
present
unknown
it
has
been
ordained
that
a
select
few
must
from
time
to
time
pass
over
the
threshold
that
divides
a
mortal
present
life
from
the
future
and
your
lot
has
been
cast
among
the
favored
ones
it
is
or
should
be
deemed
a
privilege
to
be
permitted
to
pass
farther
than
human
philosophy
has
yet
gone
into
an
investigation
of
the
problems
of
life
this
i
say
to
encourage
you
we
have
in
our
order
a
handful
of
persons
who
have
received
the
accumulated
fruits
of
the
close
attention
others
have
given
to
these
subjects
which
have
been
handed
to
them
by
the
generations
of
men
who
have
preceded
you
are
destined
to
become
as
they
are
this
study
of
forces
has
enabled
those
selected
for
the
work
to
master
some
of
the
concealed
truths
of
being
and
by
the
partial
development
of
a
new
sense
or
new
senses
partly
to
triumph
over
death
these
facts
are
hidden
from
ordinary
man
and
from
the
workers
of
our
brotherhood
who
can
not
even
interpret
the
words
they
learn
the
methods
by
which
they
are
elucidated
have
been
locked
from
man
because
the
world
is
not
prepared
to
receive
them
selfishness
being
the
ruling
passion
of
debased
mankind
and
publicity
until
the
chain
of
evidence
is
more
complete
would
embarrass
their
further
evolutions
for
man
as
yet
lives
on
the
selfish
plane
do
you
mean
that
among
men
there
are
a
few
persons
possessed
of
powers
such
as
you
have
mentioned
yes
they
move
here
and
there
through
all
orders
of
society
and
their
attainments
are
unknown
except
to
one
another
or
at
most
to
but
few
persons
these
adepts
are
scientific
men
and
may
not
even
be
recognized
as
members
of
our
organization
indeed
it
is
often
necessary
for
obvious
reasons
that
they
should
not
be
known
as
such
these
studies
must
constantly
be
prosecuted
in
various
directions
and
some
monitors
must
teach
others
to
perform
certain
duties
that
are
necessary
to
the
grand
evolution
hence
when
a
man
has
become
one
of
our
brotherhood
from
the
promptings
that
made
you
one
of
us
and
has
been
as
ready
and
determined
to
instruct
outsiders
in
our
work
as
you
have
been
it
is
proper
that
he
should
in
turn
be
compelled
to
serve
our
people
and
eventually
mankind
am
i
to
infer
from
this
i
exclaimed
a
sudden
light
breaking
upon
me
that
the
alchemistic
manuscript
that
led
me
to
the
fraternity
to
which
you
are
related
may
have
been
artfully
designed
to
serve
the
interest
of
that
organization
to
this
question
i
received
no
reply
after
an
interval
i
again
sought
information
concerning
the
order
and
with
more
success
i
understand
that
you
propose
that
i
shall
go
on
a
journey
of
investigation
for
the
good
of
our
order
and
also
of
humanity
true
it
is
necessary
that
our
discoveries
be
kept
alive
and
it
is
essential
that
the
men
who
do
this
work
accept
the
trust
of
their
own
accord
he
who
will
not
consent
to
add
to
the
common
stock
of
knowledge
and
understanding
must
be
deemed
a
drone
in
the
hive
of
nature
but
few
persons
however
are
called
upon
to
serve
as
you
must
serve
men
are
scattered
over
the
world
with
this
object
in
view
and
are
unknown
to
their
families
or
even
to
other
members
of
the
order
they
hold
in
solemn
trust
our
sacred
revelations
and
impart
them
to
others
as
is
ordained
and
thus
nothing
perishes
eventually
humanity
will
profit
others
as
you
soon
will
be
doing
are
now
exploring
assigned
sections
of
this
illimitable
field
accumulating
further
knowledge
and
they
will
report
results
to
those
whose
duty
it
is
to
retain
and
formulate
the
collected
sum
of
facts
and
principles
so
it
is
that
unknown
to
the
great
body
of
our
brotherhood
a
chosen
number
under
our
esoteric
teachings
are
gradually
passing
the
dividing
line
that
separates
life
from
death
matter
from
spirit
for
we
have
members
who
have
mastered
these
problems
we
ask
however
no
aid
of
evil
forces
or
of
necromancy
or
black
art
and
your
study
of
alchemy
was
of
no
avail
although
to
save
the
vital
truths
alchemy
is
a
part
of
our
work
we
proceed
in
exact
accordance
with
natural
laws
which
will
yet
be
known
to
all
men
sorrow
suffering
pain
of
all
descriptions
are
enemies
to
the
members
of
our
order
as
they
are
to
mankind
broadly
and
we
hope
in
the
future
so
to
control
the
now
hidden
secrets
of
nature
as
to
be
able
to
govern
the
antagonistic
disturbances
in
energy
with
which
man
now
is
everywhere
thwarted
to
subdue
the
physical
enemies
of
the
race
to
affiliate
religious
and
scientific
thought
cultivating
brotherly
love
the
foundation
and
capstone
the
cement
and
union
of
this
ancient
fraternity
and
am
i
really
to
take
an
important
part
in
this
scheme
have
i
been
set
apart
to
explore
a
section
of
the
unknown
for
a
bit
of
hidden
knowledge
and
to
return
again
this
i
will
say
he
answered
evading
a
direct
reply
you
have
been
selected
for
a
part
that
one
in
a
thousand
has
been
required

undertake
you
are
to
pass
into
a
field
that
will
carry
you
beyond
the
present
limits
of
human
observation
this
much
i
have
been
instructed
to
impart
to
you
in
order
to
nerve
you
for
your
duty
i
seem
to
be
a

really
i
am

you
seem
to
be

old
but
you
are
young
many
years
ago
cycles
ago
as
men
record
time
i
was
promoted
to
do
a
certain
work
because
of
my
zealous
nature
like
you
i
also
had
to
do
penance
for
an
error
i
disappeared
as
you
are
destined
to
do
from
the
sight
of
men
i
regained
my
youth
yours
has
been
lost
forever
but
you
will
regain
more
than
your
former
strength
we
shall
both
exist
after
this
generation
of
men
has
passed
away
and
shall
mingle
with
generations
yet
to
be
born
for
we
shall
learn
how
to
restore
our
youthful
vigor
and
will
supply
it
time
and
again
to
earthly
matter
rest
assured
also
that
the
object
of
our
labors
is
of
the
most
laudable
nature
and
we
must
be
upheld
under
all
difficulties
by
the
fact
that
multitudes
of
men
who
are

to
come
will
be
benefited
thereby
chapter
xi
my
journey
instinct
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
give
the
details
of
the
first
part
of
my
long
journey
my
companion
was
guided
by
a
perceptive
faculty
that
like
the
compass
enabled
him
to
keep
in
the
proper
course
he
did
not
question
those
whom
we
met
and
made
no
endeavor
to
maintain
a
given
direction
and
yet
he
was
traveling
in
a
part
of
the
country
that
was
new
to
himself
i
marveled
at
the
accuracy
of
his
intuitive
perception
for
he
seemed
never
to
be
at
fault
when
the
road
forked
he
turned
to
the
right
or
the
left
in
a
perfectly
careless
manner
but
the
continuity
of
his
course
was
never
interrupted
i
began
mentally
to
question
whether
he
could
be
guiding
us
aright
forgetting
that
he
was
reading
my
thoughts
and
he
answered
there
is
nothing
strange
in
this
faculty
is
not
man
capable
of
following
where
animals
lead
one
of
the
objects
of
my
special
study
has
been
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
of
animals
the
sagacity
of
brutes
the
carrier
pigeon
will
fly
to
its
cote
across
hundreds
of
miles
of
strange
country
the
young
pig
will
often
return
to
its
pen
by
a
route
unknown
to
it
the
sluggish
tortoise
will
find
its
home
without
a
guide
without
seeing
a
familiar
object
cats
horses
and
other
animals
possess
this
power
which
is
not
an
unexplainable
instinct
but
a
natural
sense
better
developed
in
some
of
the
lower
creatures
than
it
is
in
man
the
power
lies
dormant
in
man
but
exists
nevertheless
if
we
develop
one
faculty
we
lose
acuteness
in
some
other
power
men
have
lost
in
mental
development
in
this
particular
direction
while
seeking
to
gain
in
others
if
there
were
no
record
of
the
fact
that
light
brings
objects
to
the
recognition
of
the
mind
through
the
agency
of
the
eye
the
sense
of
sight
in
an
animal
would
be
considered
by
men
devoid
of
it
as
adaptability
to
extraordinary
circumstances
or
instinct
so
it
is
that
animals
often
see
clearly
where
to
the
sense
of
man
there
is
only
darkness
such
sight
is
not
irresponsive
action
without
consciousness
of
a
purpose
man
is
not
very
magnanimous
instead
of
giving
credit
to
the
lower
animals
for
superior
perception
in
many
directions
he
denies
to
them
the
conscious
possession
of
powers
imperfectly
developed
in
mankind
we
egotistically
aim
to
raise
ourselves
and
do
so
in
our
own
estimation
by
clothing
the
actions
of
the
lower
animals
in
a
garment
of
irresponsibility
because
we
can
not
understand
the
inwardness
of
their
power
we
assert
that
they
act
by
the
influence
of
instinct
the
term
instinct
as
i
would
define
it
is
an
expression
applied
by
men
to
a
series
of
senses
which
man
possesses
but
has
not
developed
the
word
is
used
by
man
to
characterize
the
mental
superiority
of
other
animals
in
certain
directions
where
his
own
senses
are
defective
instead
of
crediting
animals
with
these
to
them
invaluable
faculties
man
conceitedly
says
they
are
involuntary
actions
ignorant
of
their
mental
status
man
is
too
arrogant
to
admit
that
lower
animals
are
superior
to
him
in
any
way
but
we
are
not
consistent
is
it
not
true
that
in
the
direction
in
which
you
question
my
power
some
men
by
cultivation
often
become
expert
beyond
their
fellows
and
such
men
have
also
given
very
little
systematic
study
to
subjects
connected
with
these
undeniable
mental
qualities
the
hunter
will
hold
his
course
in
utter
darkness
passing
inequalities
in
the
ground
and
avoiding
obstructions
he
can
not
see
the
fact
of
his
superiority
in
this
way
over
others
is
not
questioned
although
he
can
not
explain
his
methods
nor
understand
how
he
operates
his
quickened
sense
is
often
as
much
entitled
to
be
called
instinct
as
is
the
divining
power
of
the
carrier
pigeon
if
scholars
would
cease
to
devote
their
entire
energies
to
the
development
of
the
material
artistic
or
scientific
part
of
modern
civilization
and
turn
their
attention
to
other
forms
of
mental
culture
many
beauties
and
powers
of
nature
now
unknown
would
be
revealed
however
this
can
not
be
for
under
existing
conditions
the
strife
for
food
and
warmth
is
the
most
important
struggle
that
engages
mankind
and
controls
our
actions
in
a
time
that
is
surely
to
come
however
when
the
knowledge
of
all
men
is
united
into
a
comprehensive
whole
the
book
of
life
illuminated
thereby
will
contain
many
beautiful
pages
that
may
be
easily
read
but
which
are
now
not
suspected
to
exist
the
power
of
the
magnet
is
not
uniform
engineers
know
that
the
needle
of
the
compass
inexplicably
deviates
from
time
to
time
as
a
line
is
run
over
the
earth
surface
but
they
also
know
that
aberrations
of
the
needle
finally
correct
themselves
the
temporary
variations
of
a
few
degrees
that
occur
in
the
running
of
a
compass
line
are
usually
overcome
after
a
time
and
without
a
change
of
course
the
disturbed
needle
swerves
back
and
again
points
to
the
calculated
direction
as
is
shown
by
the
vernier
should
i
err
in
my
course
it
would
be
by
a
trifle
only
and
we
could
not
go
far
astray
before
i
would
unconsciously
discover
the
true
path
i
carry
my
magnet
in
my
mind
many
such
dissertations
or
explanations
concerning
related
questions
were
subsequently
made
in
what
i
then
considered
a
very
impressive
though
always
unsatisfactory
manner
i
recall
those
episodes
now
after
other
more
remarkable
experiences
which
are
yet
to
be
related
and
record
them
briefly
with
little
wonderment
because
i
have
gone
through
adventures
which
demonstrate
that
there
is
nothing
improbable
in
the
statements
and
i
will
not
consume
time
with
further
details
of
this
part
of
my
journey
we
leisurely
traversed
state
after
state
crossed
rivers
mountains
and
seemingly
interminable
forests
the
ultimate
object
of
our
travels
a
location
in
kentucky
i
afterward
learned
led
my
companion
to
guide
me
by
a
roundabout
course
to
wheeling
virginia
by
the
usual
mountain
roads
of
that
day
instead
of
going
as
he
might
perhaps
have
much
more
easily
done
via
buffalo
and
the
lake
shore
to
northern
ohio
and
then
southerly
across
the
country
he
said
in
explanation
that
the
time
lost
at
the
beginning
of
our
journey
by
this
route
was
more
than
recompensed
by
the
ease
of
the
subsequent
ohio
river
trip
upon
reaching
wheeling
he
disposed
of
the
team
and
we
embarked
on
a
keel
boat
and
journeyed
down
the
ohio
to
cincinnati
the
river
was
falling
when
we
started
and
became
very
low
before
cincinnati
was
reached
too
low
for
steamers
and
our
trip
in
that
boat
on
the
sluggish
current
of
the
tortuous
stream
proved
tedious
and
slow
arriving
at
cincinnati
my
guide
decided
to
wait
for
a
rise
in
the
river
designing
then
to
complete
our
journey
on
a
steamboat
i
spent
several
days
in
cincinnati
quite
pleasantly
expecting
to
continue
our
course
on
the
steamer
tecumseh
then
in
port
and
ready
for
departure
at
the
last
moment
my
guide
changed
his
mind
and
instead
of
embarking
on
that
boat
we
took
passage
on
the
steamer
george
washington
leaving
wednesday
december
during
that
entire
journey
from
the
commencement
to
our
final
destination
my
guide
paid
all
the
bills
and
did
not
want
either
for
money
or
attention
from
the
people
with
whom
we
came
in
contact
he
seemed
everywhere
a
stranger
and
yet
was
possessed
of
a
talisman
that
opened
every
door
to
which
he
applied
and
which
gave
us
unlimited
accommodations
wherever
he
asked
them
when
the
boat
landed
at
smithland
kentucky
a
village
on
the
bank
of
the
ohio
just
above
paducah
we
disembarked
and
my
guide
then
for
the
first
time
seemed
mentally
disturbed
our
journey
together
is
nearly
over
he
said
in
a
few
days
my
responsibility
for
you
will
cease
nerve
yourself
for
the
future
and
bear
its
trials
and
its
pleasures
manfully
i
may
never
see
you
again
but
as
you
are
even
now
conspicuous
in
our
history
and
will
be
closely
connected
with
the
development
of
the
plan
in
which
i
am
also
interested
although
i
am
destined
to
take
a
different
part
i
shall
probably
hear
of
you
again

we
stopped
that
night
at

in

leaving
this

the
next
day
on

we
struck
through
the
country
into
the
bottom

traveling
leisurely
lingering
for
hours
in
the

would
have
been
marked

were
in
majestic
possession
of
large
tracts
of
territory
in
the
solitude
of
which
man
so
far
as
evidences
of
his
presence
were
concerned
had
never
before
trodden
from
time
to
time
we
passed
little
clearings
that
probably
were
to
be
enlarged
to
thrifty
plantations
in
the
future
and
finally
we
crossed
the
cumberland
river
that
night
we
rested
with
joseph
watts
a
wealthy
and
cultured
land
owner
who
resided
on
the
river
bank
after
leaving
his
home
the
next
morning
we
journeyed
slowly
very
slowly
my
guide
seemingly
passing
with
reluctance
into
the
country
he
had
become
a
very
pleasant
companion
and
his
conversation
was
very
entertaining
we
struck
the
sharp
point
of
a
ridge
the
morning
we
left
hospitable
house
it
was
four
or
five
miles
distant
but
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
cumberland
from
smithland
here
a
steep
bluff
broke
through
the
bottom
land
to
the
river
edge
the
base
of
the
bisected
point
being
washed
by
the
cumberland
river
which
had
probably
cut
its
way
through
the
stony
mineral
of
this
ridge
in
ages
long
passed
we
climbed
to
its
top
and
sat
upon
the
pinnacle
and
from
that
point
of
commanding
observation
i
drank
in
the
beauties
of
the
scene
around
me
the
river
at
our
feet
wound
gracefully
before
us
and
disappeared
in
both
directions
its
extremes
dissolving
in
a
bed
of
forest
a
great
black
bluff
far
up
the
stream
rose
like
a
mountain
upon
the
left
side
of
the
river
bottom
lands
were
about
us
and
hills
appeared
across
the
river
in
the
far
distance
towards
the
tennessee
river
with
regret
i
finally
drew
my
eyes
from
the
vision
and
we
resumed
the
journey
we
followed
the
left
bank
of
the
river
to
the
base
of
the
black
bluff
biswell
hill
a
squatter
called
it
and
then
skirted
the
side
of
that
hill
passing
along
precipitous
stone
bluffs
and
among
stunted
cedars
above
us
towered
cliff
over
cliff
almost
perpendicularly
below
us
rolled
the
river
illustration
section
of
kentucky
near
smithland
in
which
the
entrance
to
the
kentucky
cavern
is
said
to
be
located
i
was
deeply
impressed
by
the
changing
beauties
of
this
strange
kentucky
scenery
but
marveled
at
the
fact
that
while
i
became
and
enthusiastic
my
guide
grew
correspondingly
despondent
and
gloomy
from
time
to
time
he
lapsed
into
thoughtful
silence
and
once
i
caught
his
eye
directed
toward
me
in
a
manner
that
i
inferred
to
imply
either
pity
or
envy
we
passed
biswell
bluff
and
left
the
cumberland
river
at
its
upper
extremity
where
another
small
creek
empties
into
the
river
thence
after
ascending
the
creek
some
distance
we
struck
across
the
country
finding
it
undulating
and
fertile
with
here
and
there
a
small
clearing
during
this
journey
we
either
camped
out
at
night
or
stopped
with
a
resident
when
one
was
to
be
found
in
that
sparsely
settled
country
sometimes
there
were
exasperating
intervals
between
our
meals
but
we
did
not
suffer
for
we
carried
with
us
supplies
of
food
such
as
cheese
and
crackers
purchased
in
smithland
for
emergencies
we
thus
proceeded
a
considerable
distance
into
livingston
county
kentucky
i
observed
remarkable
sinks
in
the
earth
sometimes
again
precipitous
these
cavities
were
occasionally
of
considerable
size
and
depth
and
they
were
more
numerous
in
the
uplands
than
in
the
bottoms
they
were
somewhat
like
the
familiar
of
new
york
state
but
monstrous
in
comparison
the
first
that
attracted
my
attention
was
near
the
cumberland
river
just
before
we
reached
biswell
hill
it
was
about
forty
feet
deep
and
thirty
in
diameter
with
precipitous
stone
sides
shrubbery
growing
therein
in
exceptional
spots
where
loose
earth
had
collected
on
shelves
of
stone
that
cropped
out
along
its
rugged
sides
the
bottom
of
the
depression
was
flat
and
fertile
covered
with
a
luxuriant
mass
of
vegetation
on
one
side
of
the
base
of
the
gigantic
bowl
a
cavern
struck
down
into
the
earth
i
stood
upon
the
edge
of
this
sink
and
marveled
at
its
peculiar
appearance
a
spirit
of
curiosity
such
as
often
influences
men
when
an
unusual
natural
scene
presents
itself
possessed
me
i
clambered
down
swinging
from
brush
to
brush
and
stepping
from
to
until
i
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
and
placing
my
hand
above
the
black
hole
in
its
center
i
perceived
that
a
current
of
cold
air
was
rushing
therefrom
upward
i
probed
with
a
long
stick
but
the
direction
of
the
opening
was
tortuous
and
would
not
admit
of
examination
in
that
manner
i
dropped
a
large
into
the
orifice
the
pebble
rolled
and
clanked
down
down
and
at
last
the
sound
died
away
in
the
distance
i
wish
that
i
could
go
into
the
cavity
as
that
stone
has
done
and
find
the
secrets
of
this
cave
i
reflected
the
natural
love
of
exploration
possessing
me
as
it
probably
does
most
men
my
companion
above
seated
on
the
brink
of
the
stone
wall
replied
to
my
thoughts
your
wish
shall
be
granted
you
have
requested
that
which
has
already
been
laid
out
for
you
you
will
explore
where
few
men
have
passed
before
and
will
have
the
privilege
of
following
your
destiny
into
a
realm
of
natural
wonders
a
fertile
field
of
investigation
awaits
you
such
as
will
surpass
your
most
vivid
imaginings
come
and
seat
yourself
beside
me
for
it
is
my
duty
now
to
tell
you
something
about
the
land
we
are
approaching
the
cavern
fields
of
kentucky
chapter
xiii
the
and
caverns
of
into
the
unknown
country
this
part
of
kentucky
borders
a
field
of
caverns
that
reaches
from
near
the
state
of
tennessee
to
the
ohio
river
and
from
the
mouth
of
the
cumberland
eastward
to
and
beyond
the
center
of
the
state
this
great
area
is
of
irregular
outline
and
as
yet
has
been
little
explored
underneath
the
surface
are
layers
of
limestone
and
sandstone
rock
the
deposits
ranging
from
ten
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
thickness
and
often
great
masses
of
conglomerate
appear
this
conglomerate
sometimes
caps
the
ridges
and
varies
in
thickness
from
a
few
feet
only
to
sixty
or
even
a
hundred
feet
it
is
of
a
diversified
character
sometimes
largely
composed
of
pebbles
cemented
together
by
iron
ore
into
compact
beds
while
again
it
passes
abruptly
into
gritty
sandstone
or
a
compact
rock
destitute
of
pebbles
sometimes
the
conglomerate
rests
directly
on
the
limestone
but
in
the
section
about
us
more
often
argillaceous
shales
or
veins
of
coal
intervene
and
occasionally
inferior
and
superior
layers
of
conglomerate
are
separated
by
a
bed
of
coal
in
addition
veins
now
and
then
crop
up
the
crystals
of
galena
being
disseminated
through
masses
of
limestone
and
clay
which
fill
fissures
between
tilted
walls
of
limestone
and
hard
quartzose
sandstone
valleys
hills
and
mountains
grow
out
of
this
remarkable
crust
rivers
and
creeks
flow
through
and
under
it
in
crevices
either
directly
upon
the
bedstone
or
over
deposits
of
clay
which
underlie
it
in
some
places
beds
of
coal
or
slate
alternate
with
layers
of
the
lime
rock
in
others
the
interspace
is
clay
and
sand
sometimes
the
depth
of
the
several
limestone
and
conglomerate
deposits
is
great
and
they
are
often
honeycombed
by
innumerable
transverse
and
diagonal
spaces
water
drips
have
here
and
there
washed
out
the
more
friable
earth
and
stone
forming
grottoes
which
are
as
yet
unknown
to
men
but
which
will
be
discovered
to
be
wonderful
and
fantastic
beyond
anything
of
a
like
nature
now
familiar
in
other
places
cavities
exist
between
shelves
of
rock
that
lie
one
above
the
other
monstrous
openings
caused
by
the
erosive
action
of
rivers
now
lost
but
that
have
flowed
during
unnumbered
ages
past
great
parallel
valleys
and
gigantic
chambers
one
over
the
other
remaining
to
tell
the
story
of
these
former
torrents
occasionally
the
weight
of
a
portion
of
the
disintegrating
rock
above
becomes
too
great
for
its
tensile
strength
and
the
material
crumbles
and
falls
producing
caverns
sometimes
reaching
so
near
to
the
earth
surface
as
to
cause
sinks
in
its
crust
these
sinks
when
first
formed
as
a
rule
present
clear
rock
fractures
and
immediately
after
their
formation
there
is
usually
a
beneath
in
the
course
of
time
soil
collects
on
their
sides
they
become
hollows
from
the
of
earth
and
then
vegetation
appears
on
the
living
soil
trees
grow
within
them
and
in
many
places
the
sloping
sides
of
great
earth
bowls
of
this
nature
are
after
untold
years
covered
with
the
virgin
forest
magnificent
timber
trees
growing
on
soil
that
has
been
stratified
over
and
upon
decayed
monarchs
of
the
forest
whose
remains
imbedded
in
the
earth
speak
of
the
ages
that
have
passed
since
the
convulsions
that
made
the
depressions
which
notwithstanding
the
accumulated
debris
are
still
a
hundred
feet
or
more
in
depth
if
the
drain
or
exit
at
the
vortex
of
one
of
these
sinks
becomes
clogged
which
often
occurs
the
entire
cavity
fills
with
water
and
a
pond
results
again
a
slight
orifice
reaching
far
beneath
the
earth
surface
may
permit
the
soil
to
be
gradually
washed
into
a
subterranean
creek
and
thus
are
formed
great
bowls
like
funnels
sunk
in
the
earth
kentucky
take
the
country
about
us
especially
towards
the
mammoth
cave
and
for
miles
beyond
the
landscape
in
certain
localities
is
pitted
with
this
description
of
sinks
some
recent
others
very
old
many
are
small
but
deep
others
are
large
and
shallow
ponds
often
of
great
depth
curiously
enough
overflowing
and
giving
rise
to
a
creek
are
to
be
found
on
a
ridge
telling
of
underground
supply
springs
not
outlets
beneath
chains
of
such
sinks
like
a
row
of
huge
funnels
often
appear
the
soil
between
them
is
slowly
washed
through
their
exit
into
the
river
flowing
in
the
depths
below
and
as
the
earth
that
separates
them
is
carried
away
by
the
subterranean
streams
the
bowls
coalesce
and
a
ravine
closed
at
both
ends
results
along
the
bottom
of
such
a
ravine
a
creek
may
flow
rushing
from
its
natural
tunnel
at
one
end
of
the
line
and
disappearing
in
a
gulf
at
the
other
the
stream
begins
in
mystery
and
ends
in
unfathomed
darkness
near
marion
hurricane
creek
thus
disappears
and
so
far
as
men
know
is
lost
to
sight
forever
near
cridersville
in
this
neighborhood
a
valley
such
as
i
have
described
takes
in
the
surface
floods
of
a
large
tract
of
country
the
waters
that
run
down
its
sides
during
a
storm
form
a
torrent
and
timbers
and
other
objects
are
gulped
into
the
chasm
where
the
creek
plunges
into
the
earth
and
they
never
appear
again
this
part
of
kentucky
is
the
most
remarkable
portion
of
the
known
world
and
although
now
neglected
in
a
time
to
come
is
surely
destined
to
an
extended
distinction
i
have
referred
only
to
the
surface
the
skin
formation
of
this
honeycombed
labyrinth
the
entrance
to
the
future
wonderland
of
the
world
portions
of
such
a
superficial
cavern
maze
have
been
traversed
by
man
in
the
ramifications
known
as
the
mammoth
cave
but
deeper
than
man
has
yet
explored
the
subcutaneous
structure
of
that
series
of
caverns
is
yet
to
be
investigated
the
mammoth
cave
as
now
traversed
is
simply
a
superficial
series
of
grottoes
and
passages
overlying
the
deeper
cavern
field
that
i
have
described
the
explored
chain
of
passages
is
of
great
interest
to
men
it
is
true
but
of
minor
importance
compared
to
others
yet
unknown
being
in
fact
the
result
of
mere
surface
erosion
the
river
that
bisects
the
cave
just
beneath
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
known
as
echo
river
is
a
miniature
stream
there
are
others
more
magnificent
that
flow
majestically
far
far
beneath
it
as
we
descend
into
the
earth
in
that
locality
caverns
multiply
in
number
and
increase
in
size
retaining
the
general
configuration
of
those
i
have
described
the
layers
of
rock
are
thicker
the
intervening
spaces
broader
and
the
spaces
stretch
in
increasingly
expanded
chambers
for
miles
while
high
above
each
series
of
caverns
the
solid
ceilings
of
stone
arch
and
interarch
sheltered
under
these
subterrene
alcoves
are
streams
lakes
rivers
and
near
the
surface
of
the
earth
such
waters
often
teem
with
aquatic
life
and
some
of
the
caves
are
inhabited
by
species
of
birds
reptiles
and
mammals
as
yet
unknown
to
men
creatures
possessed
of
senses
and
organs
that
are
different
from
any
we
find
with
surface
animals
and
also
apparently
defective
in
particulars
that
would
startle
persons
acquainted
only
with
creatures
that
live
in
the
sunshine
it
is
a
world
beneath
a
world
a
world
within
a
world
my
guide
abruptly
stopped
i
sat
entranced
marveling
at
the
adept
knowledge
admiring
his
accomplishments
i
gazed
into
the
cavity
that
yawned
beneath
me
and
imagined
its
possible
but
to
me
invisible
secrets
enraptured
with
the
thought
of
searching
into
them
who
would
not
feel
elated
at
the
prospect
of
an
exploration
such
as
i
foresaw
might
be
pursued
in
my
immediate
future
i
had
often
been
charmed
with
narrative
descriptions
of
discoveries
and
book
accounts
of
scientific
investigations
but
i
had
never
pictured
myself
as
a
participant
in
such
fascinating
enterprises
indeed
indeed
i
cried
exultingly
lead
me
to
this
wonderland
show
me
the
entrance
to
this
subterranean
world
and
i
promise
willingly
to
do
as
you
bid
bravo
he
replied
your
heart
is
right
your
courage
sufficient
i
have
not
disclosed
a
thousandth
part
of
the
wonders
which
i
have
knowledge
of
and
which
await
your
research
and
probably
i
have
not
gained
even
an
insight
into
the
mysteries
that
if
your
courage
permits
you
will
be
privileged
to
comprehend
your
destiny
lies
beyond
far
beyond
that
which
i
have
pictured
or
experienced
and
i
notwithstanding
my
opportunities
have
no
conception
of
its
end
for
at
the
critical
moment
my
heart
faltered
i
can
therefore
only
describe
the
beginning
thus
at
the
lower
extremity
of
biswell
hill
i
was
made
aware
of
the
fact
that
within
a
short
time
i
should
be
separated
from
my
sympathetic
guide
and
that
it
was
to
be
my
duty
to
explore
alone
or
in
other
company
some
portion
of
these
kentucky
cavern
deeps
and
i
longed
for
the
beginning
of
my
underground
journey
heavens
how
different
would
have
been
my
future
life
could
i
then
have
realized
my
position
would
that
i
could
have
seen
the
end
after
a
few
days
of
uneventful
travel
we
rested
one
afternoon
in
a
hilly
country
that
before
us
appeared
to
be
more
rugged
even
mountainous
we
had
wandered
leisurely
and
were
now
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
cumberland
river
the
aim
of
my
guide
being
as
i
surmised
to
evade
a
direct
approach
to
some
object
of
interest
which
i
must
not
locate
exactly
and
yet
which
i
shall
try
to
describe
accurately
enough
for
identification
by
a
person
familiar
with
the
topography
of
that
section
we
stood
on
the
side
of
a
stony
sloping
hill
back
of
which
spread
a
wooded
undulating
valley
i
remember
to
have
passed
along
a
creek
in
that
valley
i
remarked
looking
back
over
our
pathway
it
appeared
to
rise
from
this
direction
but
the
source
ends
abruptly
in
this
chain
of
hills
the
stream
is
beneath
us
he
answered
advancing
a
few
paces
he
brought
to
my
attention
on
the
hillside
an
opening
in
the
earth
this
aperture
was
irregular
in
form
about
the
diameter
of
a
well
and
descended
perpendicularly
into
the
stony
crust
i
leaned
far
over
the
orifice
and
heard
the
gurgle
of
rushing
water
beneath
the
guide
dropped
a
heavy
stone
into
the
gloomy
shaft
and
in
some
seconds
a
dull
splash
announced
its
plunge
into
underground
water
then
he
leaned
over
the
stony
edge
and
could
i
be
mistaken
seemed
to
signal
to
some
one
beneath
but
it
must
be
imagination
on
my
part
i
argued
to
myself
even
against
my
very
sense
of
sight
rising
and
taking
me
by
the
hand
my
guardian
spoke
brother
we
approach
the
spot
where
you
and
i
must
separate
i
serve
my
masters
and
am
destined
to
go
where
i
shall
next
be
commanded
you
will
descend
into
the
earth
as
you
have
recently
desired
to
do
here
we
part
most
likely
forever
this
rocky
fissure
will
admit
the
last
ray
of
sunlight
on
your
path
my
heart
failed
how
often
are
we
courageous
in
daylight
and
timid
by
night
men
unflinchingly
face
in
sunshine
dangers
at
which
they
shudder
in
the
darkness
how
am
i
to
descend
into
that
abyss
i
gasped
the
sides
are
perpendicular
the
depth
is
unknown
then
i
cried
in
alarm
the
sense
of
distrust
deepening
do
you
mean
to
drown
me
is
it
for
this
you
have
led
me
away
from
my
native
state
from
friends
home
and
kindred
you
have
enticed
me
into
this
wilderness
i
have
been
decoyed
and
like
a
foolish
child
have
willingly
accompanied
my
destroyer
you
feared
to
murder
me
in
my
distant
home
the
earth
could
not
have
hidden
me
niagara
even
might
have
given
up
my
body
to
dismay
the
murderers
in
this
underground
river
in
the
wilds
of
kentucky
all
trace
of
my
existence
will
disappear
forever
i
was
growing
furious
my
frenzied
eyes
searched
the
ground
for
some
missile
of
defense
by
strange
chance
some
one
had
left
on
that
solitary
spot
a
rude
weapon
providentially
dropped
for
my
use
i
thought
it
was
a
small
iron
bolt
or
bar
somewhat
rusted
i
threw
myself
upon
the
earth
and
as
i
did
so
picked
this
up
quickly
and
secreted
it
within
my
bosom
then
i
arose
and
resumed
my
stormy
denunciation
you
have
played
your
part
well
you
have
led
your
unresisting
victim
to
the
sacrifice
but
if
i
am
compelled
to
plunge
into
this
black
grave
you
shall
go
with
me
i
shrieked
in
desperation
and
suddenly
threw
my
arms
around
the
gentle
adept
intending
to
hurl
him
into
the
chasm
at
this
point
i
felt
my
hands
seized
from
behind
in
a
cold
clammy
irresistible
embrace
my
fingers
were
loosed
by
a
strong
grasp
and
i
turned
to
find
myself
confronted
by
a
singular
looking
being
who
quietly
said
you
are
not
to
be
destroyed
we
wish
only
to
do
your
bidding
the
speaker
stood
in
a
stooping
position
with
his
face
towards
the
earth
as
if
to
shelter
it
from
the
sunshine
he
was
less
than
five
feet
in
height
his
arms
and
legs
were
bare
and
his
skin
the
color
of
light
blue
putty
glistened
in
the
sunlight
like
the
slimy
hide
of
a
water
dog
he
raised
his
head
and
i
shuddered
in
affright
as
i
beheld
that
his
face
was
not
that
of
a
human
his
forehead
extended
in
an
unbroken
plane
from
crown
to
cheek
bone
and
the
chubby
tip
of
an
abortive
nose
without
nostrils
formed
a
short
projection
near
the
center
of
the
level
ridge
which
represented
a
countenance
there
was
no
semblance
of
an
eye
for
there
were
no
sockets
yet
his
voice
was
singularly
perfect
his
face
if
face
it
could
be
called
was
wet
and
water
dripped
from
all
parts
of
his
slippery
person
yet
repulsive
as
he
looked
i
shuddered
more
at
the
remembrance
of
the
touch
of
that
cold
clammy
hand
than
at
the
sight
of
his
figure
for
a
dead
man
could
not
have
chilled
me
as
he
had
done
with
his
sappy
skin
from
which
the
moisture
seemed
to
ooze
as
from
the
hide
of
a
water
lizard
illustration
confronted
by
a
singular
looking
being
turning
to
my
guide
this
freak
of
nature
said
softly
i
have
come
in
obedience
to
the
signal
i
realized
at
once
that
alone
with
these
two
i
was
powerless
and
that
to
resist
would
be
suicidal
instantly
my
effervescing
passion
subsided
and
i
expressed
no
further
surprise
at
this
sudden
and
remarkable
apparition
but
mentally
acquiesced
i
was
alone
and
helpless
rage
gave
place
to
inertia
in
the
despondency
that
followed
the
realization
of
my
hopeless
condition
the
grotesque
newcomer
who
though
sightless
possessed
a
strange
instinct
led
us
to
the
base
of
the
hill
a
few
hundred
feet
away
and
there
gushing
into
the
light
from
the
rocky
bluff
i
saw
a
magnificent
stream
issuing
many
feet
in
width
this
was
the
of
the
mysterious
brook
that
i
had
previously
noticed
it
flowed
from
an
archway
in
the
solid
stone
springing
directly
out
of
the
cliff
beautiful
and
picturesque
in
its
surroundings
the
limpid
water
clear
and
sparkling
issued
from
the
unknown
source
that
was
typical
of
darkness
but
the
brook
of
crystal
leaped
into
a
world
of
sunshine
light
and
freedom
brother
said
my
companion
this
spring
emerging
from
this
prison
of
earth
images
to
us
what
humanity
will
be
when
the
prisoning
walls
of
ignorance
that
now
enthrall
him
are
removed
man
has
heretofore
relied
chiefly
for
his
advancement
both
mental
and
physical
on
knowledge
gained
from
scientific
explorations
and
researches
with
matter
from
material
studies
rather
than
spiritual
all
his
investigations
having
been
confined
to
the
crude
coarse
substance
of
the
surface
of
the
globe
spiritualistic
investigations
unfortunately
are
considered
by
scientific
men
too
often
as
reaching
backward
only
the
religions
of
the
world
clasp
hands
with
and
lean
upon
the
dead
past
it
is
true
but
point
to
a
living
future
man
must
yet
search
by
the
agency
of
senses
and
spirit
the
unfathomed
mysteries
that
lie
beneath
his
feet
and
over
his
head
and
he
who
refuses
to
bow
to
the
creator
and
honor
his
handiwork
discredits
himself
when
this
work
is
accomplished
as
it
yet
will
be
the
future
man
able
then
to
comprehend
the
problem
of
life
in
its
broader
significance
drawing
from
all
directions
the
facts
necessary
to
his
mental
advancement
will
have
reached
a
state
in
which
he
can
enjoy
bodily
comfort
and
supreme
spiritual
perfection
while
he
is
yet
an
mortal
in
hastening
this
consummation
it
is
necessary
that
an
occasional
human
life
should
be
lost
to
the
world
but
such
sacrifices
are
noble
yes
sublime
because
contributing
to
the
future
exaltation
of
our
race
the
secret
workers
in
the
sacred
order
of
which
you
are
still
a
member
have
ever
taken
an
important
part
in
furthering
such
a
system
of
evolution
this
feature
of
our
work
is
unknown
to
brethren
of
the
ordinary
fraternity
and
the
individual
research
of
each
secret
messenger
is
unguessed
by
the
craft
at
large
hence
it
is
that
the
open
workers
of
our
order
those
initiated
by
degrees
only
who
in
lodge
rooms
carry
on
their
beneficent
labors
among
men
have
had
no
hand
other
than
as
agents
in
your
removal
and
no
knowledge
of
your
present
or
future
movements
their
function
is
to
keep
together
our
organization
on
earth
and
from
them
only
an
occasional
member
is
selected
as
you
have
been
to
perform
special
duties
in
certain
adventurous
studies
are
you
willing
to
go
on
this
journey
of
exploration
and
are
you
brave
enough
to
meet
the
trials
you
have
invited
again
my
enthusiasm
arose
and
i
felt
the
thrill
experienced
by
an
investigator
who
stands
on
the
brink
of
an
important
discovery
and
needs
but
courage
to
advance
and
i
answered
yes
then
farewell
this
archway
is
the
entrance
that
will
admit
you
into
your
arcanum
of
usefulness
this
mystic
brother
though
a
stranger
to
you
has
long
been
apprised
of
our
coming
and
it
was
he
who
sped
me
on
my
journey
to
seek
you
and
who
has
since
been
waiting
for
us
and
is
to
be
your
guide
during
the
first
stages
of
your
subterrene
progress
he
is
a
friend
and
if
you
trust
him
will
protect
you
from
harm
you
will
find
the
necessaries
of
life
supplied
for
i
have
traversed
part
of
your
coming
road
that
part
i
therefore
know
but
as
i
have
said
you
are
to
go
deeper
into
the
unexplored
yes
into
and
beyond
the
beyond
until
finally
you
will
come
to
the
gateway
that
leads
into
the
country
chapter
xiv
farewell
to
god
the
echo
of
the
cry
thus
speaking
my
quiet
leader
who
had
so
long
been
as
a
shepherd
to
my
wandering
feet
on
the
upper
earth
grasped
my
hands
tightly
and
placed
them
in
those
of
my
new
companion
whose
clammy
fingers
closed
over
them
as
with
a
grip
of
iron
the
mysterious
being
now
my
custodian
turned
towards
the
creek
drawing
me
after
him
and
together
we
silently
and
solemnly
waded
beneath
the
stone
archway
as
i
passed
under
the
shadow
of
that
dismal
yawning
cliff
i
turned
my
head
to
take
one
last
glimpse
of
the
world
i
had
known
that
warm
precinct
of
the
cheerful
day
and
tears
sprang
to
my
eyes
i
thought
of
life
family
friends
of
all
for
which
men
live
and
a
melancholy
vision
arose
that
of
my
lost
lost
home
my
dear
companion
of
the
journey
that
had
just
ended
stood
in
the
sunlight
on
the
banks
of
the
rippling
stream
gazing
at
us
intently
and
waved
an
affectionate
farewell
my
uncouth
new
associate
guide
or
master
whichever
he
might
be
of
the
journey
to
come
clasped
me
firmly
by
the
arms
and
waded
slowly
onward
thrusting
me
steadily
against
the
cold
current
and
with
irresistible
force
pressed
me
into
the
thickening
darkness
the
daylight
disappeared
the
pathway
contracted
the
water
deepened
and
became
more
chilly
we
were
constrained
to
bow
our
heads
in
order
to
avoid
the
overhanging
vault
of
stone
the
water
reached
to
my
chin
and
now
the
roof
touched
the
crown
of
my
head
then
i
shuddered
convulsively
as
the
last
ray
of
daylight
disappeared
had
it
not
been
for
my
companion
i
know
that
i
should
have
sunk
in
despair
and
drowned
but
with
a
firm
hand
he
held
my
head
above
the
water
and
steadily
pushed
me
onward
i
had
reached
the
extreme
of
despondency
i
neither
feared
nor
cared
for
life
nor
death
and
i
realized
that
powerless
to
control
my
own
acts
my
fate
the
future
my
existence
depended
on
the
strange
being
beside
me
i
was
mysteriously
sustained
however
by
a
sense
of
bodily
security
such
as
comes
over
us
as
when
in
the
hands
of
an
experienced
guide
we
journey
through
a
wilderness
for
i
felt
that
my
pilot
of
the
underworld
did
not
purpose
to
destroy
me
we
halted
a
moment
and
then
as
a
faint
light
overspread
us
my
eyeless
guide
directed
me
to
look
upward
we
now
stand
beneath
the
crevice
which
you
were
told
by
your
former
guide
would
admit
the
last
ray
of
sunlight
on
your
path
i
also
say
to
you
this
struggling
ray
of
sunlight
is
to
be
your
last
for
years
i
gazed
above
me
feeling
all
the
wretchedness
of
a
dying
man
who
with
faculties
intact
might
stand
on
the
dark
edge
of
the
hillside
of
eternity
glancing
back
into
the
bright
world
and
that
small
opening
far
far
overhead
seemed
as
the
gate
to
paradise
lost
many
a
person
assured
of
ascending
at
will
has
stood
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
well
or
shaft
to
a
mine
and
even
then
felt
the
undescribable
sensation
of
dread
often
terror
that
is
produced
by
such
a
situation
awe
mystery
uncertainty
of
life
and
future
superadded
may
express
my
sensation
i
trembled
shrinking
in
horror
from
my
captor
and
struggled
violently
hold
hold
i
begged
as
one
involuntarily
prays
a
surgeon
to
delay
the
incision
of
the
amputating
knife
just
one
moment
my
companion
unheeding
moved
on
the
light
vanished
instantly
and
we
were
surrounded
by
total
darkness
god
sunshine
was
blotted
out
illustration
this
struggling
ray
of
sunlight
is
to
be
your
last
for
years
then
i
again
became
unconcerned
i
was
not
now
responsible
for
my
own
existence
and
the
feeling
that
i
experienced
when
a
prisoner
in
the
closed
carriage
returned
i
grew
careless
as
to
my
fate
and
with
stolid
indifference
struggled
onward
as
we
progressed
slowly
against
the
current
of
water
i
began
to
interest
myself
in
speculations
regarding
our
surroundings
and
the
object
or
outcome
of
our
journey
in
places
the
water
was
shallow
scarce
reaching
to
our
ankles
again
it
was
so
deep
that
we
could
wade
only
with
exertion
and
at
times
the
passage
up
which
we
toiled
was
so
narrow
that
it
would
scarcely
admit
us
after
a
long
laborious
stemming
of
the
unseen
brook
my
companion
directed
me
to
close
my
mouth
hold
my
nostrils
with
my
fingers
and
stoop
almost
diving
with
me
beneath
the
water
he
drew
me
through
the
submerged
crevice
and
we
ascended
into
an
open
chamber
and
left
the
creek
behind
us
i
fancied
that
we
were
in
a
large
room
and
as
i
shouted
aloud
to
test
my
hypothesis
echo
after
echo
answered
until
at
last
the
cry
reverberated
and
died
away
in
distant
murmurs
we
were
evidently
in
a
great
pocket
or
cavern
through
which
my
guide
now
walked
rapidly
indeed
he
passed
along
with
unerring
footsteps
as
certain
of
his
course
as
i
might
be
on
familiar
ground
in
full
daylight
i
perceived
that
he
systematically
evaded
inequalities
that
i
could
not
anticipate
nor
see
he
would
tell
me
to
step
up
or
down
as
the
surroundings
required
and
we
ascended
or
descended
accordingly
our
path
turned
to
the
right
or
the
left
from
time
to
time
but
my
eyeless
guide
passed
through
what
were
evidently
the
most
tortuous
windings
without
a
mishap
i
wondered
much
at
this
gift
of
knowledge
and
at
last
overcame
my
reserve
sufficiently
to
ask
how
we
could
thus
unerringly
proceed
in
utter
darkness
the
reply
was
the
path
is
plainly
visible
to
me
i
see
as
clearly
in
pitch
darkness
as
you
can
in
sunshine
explain
yourself
further
i
requested
he
replied
not
yet
and
continued
you
are
weary
we
will
rest
he
conducted
me
to
a
seat
on
a
ledge
and
left
me
for
a
time
returning
soon
he
placed
in
my
hands
food
which
i
ate
with
novel
relish
the
pabulum
seemed
to
be
of
vegetable
origin
though
varieties
of
it
had
a
peculiar
flavor
several
separate
and
distinct
substances
were
contained
in
the
queer
viands
some
portions
savoring
of
wholesome
flesh
while
others
possessed
the
delicate
flavors
of
various
fruits
such
as
the
strawberry
and
the
pineapple
the
strange
edibles
were
of
a
pulpy
texture
homogeneous
in
consistence
parts
being
juicy
and
acid
like
grateful
fruits
some
portions
were
in
slices
or
films
that
i
could
hold
in
my
hand
like
sections
of
a
velvet
melon
and
yet
were
in
many
respects
unlike
any
other
food
that
i
had
ever
tasted
there
was
neither
rind
nor
seed
it
seemed
as
though
i
were
eating
the
gills
of
a
fish
and
in
answer
to
my
question
the
guide
remarked
yes
it
is
the
gill
but
not
the
gill
of
a
fish
you
will
be
instructed
in
due
time
i
will
add
that
after
this
whenever
necessary
we
were
supplied
with
food
but
both
thirst
and
hunger
disappeared
altogether
before
our
underground
journey
was
finished
after
a
while
we
again
began
our
journey
which
we
continued
in
what
was
to
me
absolute
darkness
my
strength
seemed
to
endure
the
fatigue
to
a
wonderful
degree
notwithstanding
that
we
must
have
been
walking
hour
after
hour
and
i
expressed
a
curiosity
about
the
fact
my
guide
replied
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
cavern
possessed
an
intrinsic
vitalizing
power
that
neutralized
fatigue
or
he
said
there
is
here
an
inherent
constitutional
energy
derived
from
an
active
gaseous
substance
that
belongs
to
cavern
air
at
this
depth
and
sustains
the
life
force
by
contributing
directly
to
its
conservation
taking
the
place
of
food
and
drink
i
do
not
understand
i
said
no
and
you
do
not
comprehend
how
ordinary
air
supports
mind
and
vitalizes
muscle
and
at
the
same
time
wears
out
both
muscle
and
all
other
tissues
these
are
facts
which
are
not
satisfactorily
explained
by
scientific
statements
concerning
oxygenation
of
the
blood
as
we
descend
into
the
earth
we
find
an
increase
in
the
life
force
of
the
cavern
air
this
reference
to
surface
earth
recalled
my
former
life
and
led
me
to
contrast
my
present
situation
with
that
i
had
forfeited
i
was
seized
with
an
uncontrollable
longing
for
home
and
a
painful
craving
for
the
past
took
possession
of
my
heart
but
with
a
strong
effort
i
shook
off
the
sensations
we
traveled
on
and
on
in
silence
and
in
darkness
and
i
thought
again
of
the
strange
remark
of
my
former
guide
who
had
said
you
are
destined
to
go
deeper
into
the
unknown
yes
into
and
beyond
the
beyond
chapter
xv
a
zone
of
light
deep
within
the
earth
oh
for
one
glimpse
of
light
a
ray
of
sunshine
in
reply
to
this
my
mental
ejaculation
my
guide
said
can
not
you
perceive
that
the
darkness
is
becoming
less
intense
no
i
answered
i
can
not
night
is
absolute
are
you
sure
he
asked
cover
your
eyes
with
your
hands
then
uncover
and
open
them
i
did
so
and
fancied
that
by
contrast
a
faint
gray
hue
was
apparent
this
must
be
imagination
no
we
now
approach
a
zone
of
earth
light
let
us
hasten
on
a
zone
of
light
deep
in
the
earth
incomprehensible
incredible
i
muttered
and
yet
as
we
went
onward
and
time
passed
the
darkness
was
less
intense
the
barely
perceptible
hue
became
gray
and
somber
and
then
of
a
pearly
translucence
and
although
i
could
not
distinguish
the
outline
of
objects
yet
i
unquestionably
perceived
light
i
am
amazed
what
can
be
the
cause
of
this
phenomenon
what
is
the
nature
of
this
mysterious
halo
that
surrounds
us
i
held
my
open
hand
before
my
eyes
and
perceived
the
darkness
of
my
spread
fingers
it
is
light
it
is
light
i
shouted
it
is
really
light
and
from
near
and
from
far
the
echoes
of
that
subterranean
cavern
answered
back
joyfully
it
is
light
it
is
light
i
wept
in
joy
and
threw
my
arms
about
my
guide
forgetting
in
the
ecstasy
his
clammy
cuticle
and
danced
in
hysterical
glee
and
alternately
laughed
and
cried
how
vividly
i
realized
then
that
the
imprisoned
miner
would
give
a
world
of
gold
his
former
god
for
a
ray
of
light
compose
yourself
this
emotional
exhibition
is
an
evidence
of
weakness
an
investigator
should
neither
become
depressed
over
a
reverse
nor
unduly
enthusiastic
over
a
fortunate
discovery
but
we
approach
the
earth
surface
soon
i
will
be
back
in
the
sunshine
again
upon
the
contrary
we
have
been
continually
descending
into
the
earth
and
we
are
now
ten
miles
or
more
beneath
the
level
of
the
ocean
illustration
we
approach
daylight
i
can
see
your
form
i
shrank
back
hesitated
and
in
despondency
gazed
at
his
hazy
outline
then
as
if
palsied
sank
upon
the
stony
floor
but
as
i
saw
the
light
before
me
i
leaped
up
and
shouted
what
you
say
is
not
true
we
approach
daylight
i
can
see
your
form
listen
to
me
he
said
can
not
you
understand
that
i
have
led
you
continually
down
a
steep
descent
and
that
for
hours
there
has
been
no
step
upward
with
but
little
exertion
you
have
walked
this
distance
without
becoming
wearied
and
you
could
not
without
great
fatigue
have
ascended
for
so
long
a
period
you
are
entering
a
zone
of
inner
earth
light
we
are
in
the
surface
the
upper
edge
of
it
let
us
hasten
on
for
when
this
cavern
darkness
is
at
an
end
and
i
will
say
we
have
nearly
passed
that
limit
your
courage
will
return
and
then
we
will
rest
you
surely
do
not
speak
the
truth
science
and
philosophy
and
i
am
somewhat
versed
in
both
have
never
told
me
of
such
a
light
can
philosophers
more
than
speculate
about
that
which
they
have
not
experienced
if
they
have
no
data
from
which
to
calculate
name
the
student
in
science
who
has
reached
this
depth
in
earth
or
has
seen
a
man
to
tell
him
of
these
facts
i
can
not
then
why
should
you
have
expected
any
of
them
to
describe
our
surroundings
misguided
men
will
torture
science
by
refuting
facts
with
theories
but
a
fact
is
no
less
a
fact
when
science
opposes
illustration
seated
himself
on
a
natural
bench
of
stone
i
recognized
the
force
of
his
arguments
and
cordially
grasped
his
hand
in
indication
of
submission
we
continued
our
journey
and
rapidly
traveled
downward
and
onward
the
light
gradually
increased
in
intensity
until
at
length
the
cavern
near
about
us
seemed
to
be
as
bright
as
diffused
daylight
could
have
made
it
there
was
apparently
no
central
point
of
radiation
the
light
was
such
as
to
pervade
and
exist
in
the
surrounding
space
somewhat
as
the
vapor
of
phosphorus
spreads
a
haze
throughout
the
bubble
into
which
it
is
blown
the
visual
agent
surrounding
us
had
a
permanent
luminosity
and
was
a
pervading
bright
unreachable
essence
that
without
an
obvious
origin
diffused
itself
equally
in
all
directions
it
reminded
me
of
the
form
of
light
that
in
previous
years
i
had
seen
described
as
epipolic
dispersion
and
as
i
refer
to
the
matter
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
man
will
yet
find
that
the
same
cause
produces
both
phenomena
i
was
informed
now
by
the
sense
of
sight
that
we
were
in
a
cavern
room
of
considerable
size
the
apartment
presented
somewhat
the
appearance
of
the
usual
underground
caverns
that
i
had
seen
pictured
in
books
and
yet
was
different
stalactites
stalagmites
saline
incrustations
occurring
occasionally
reminded
me
of
travelers
stories
but
these
objects
were
not
so
abundant
as
might
be
supposed
such
accretions
or
deposits
of
saline
substances
as
i
noticed
were
also
disappointing
in
that
instead
of
having
a
dazzling
brilliancy
like
frosted
snow
crystals
they
were
of
a
uniform
gray
or
brown
hue
indeed
my
former
imaginative
mental
creations
regarding
underground
caverns
were
dispelled
in
this
somber
stone
temple
for
even
the
floor
and
the
fragments
of
stone
that
in
considerable
quantities
strewed
the
floor
were
of
the
usual
rock
formations
of
upper
earth
the
glittering
crystals
of
snowy
white
or
rainbow
tints
fairy
caverns
pictured
by
travelers
and
described
as
inexpressibly
grand
and
beautiful
in
other
cavern
labyrinths
were
wanting
here
and
i
saw
only
occasional
small
clusters
of
quartz
crystals
that
were
other
than
of
a
dull
gray
color
finally
after
hours
or
perhaps
days
of
travel
interspersed
with
restings
conversations
and
arguments
amid
which
i
could
form
no
idea
of
the
flight
of
time
my
companion
seated
himself
on
a
natural
bench
of
stone
and
directed
me
to
rest
likewise
he
broke
the
silence
and
spoke
as
follows
chapter

vitalized
the
narrows
in
science
in
studying
any
branch
of
science
men
begin
and
end
with
an
unknown
the
chemist
accepts
as
data
such
conditions
of
matter
as
he
finds
about
him
and
connects
ponderable
matter
with
the
displays
of
energy
that
have
impressed
his
senses
building
therefrom
a
span
of
theoretical
science
but
he
can
not
formulate
as
yet
an
explanation
regarding
the
origin
or
the
end
of
either
mind
matter
or
energy
the
piers
supporting
his
fabric
stand
in
a
profound
invisible
gulf
into
which
even
his
imagination
can
not
look
to
form
a
theory
concerning
basic
formations
the

in
a

grasps
feebly
the
lessons
left
in
the
superficial
fragments
of
earth
strata
impressions
that
remain
to
bear
imperfect
record
of
a
few
of
the
disturbances
that
have
affected
the
earth
crust
and
he
endeavors
to
formulate
a
story
of
the
life
but
he
is
neither
able
to
antedate
the
records
shown
by
the
meager
testimony
at
his

universe
but
the
instruments
he
has
at
command
are
so
imperfect
and
mind
is
so
feeble
that
like
mockery
seems
his
attempt
to
study
behind
the
facts
connected
with
the
motions
and
conditions
of
the
nearest
heavenly
bodies
and
he
can
not
offer
an
explanation
of
the
beginning
or
cessation
of
their
movements
he
can
neither
account
for
their
existence
nor
foretell
their
end
are
you
not
mistaken
i
interrupted
does
not
the
astronomer
foretell
eclipses
and
calculate
the
orbits
of
the
planets
and
has
he
not
verified
predictions
concerning
their
several
motions
yes
but
this
is
simply
a
study
of
passing
events
the
astronomer
is
no
more
capable
of
grasping
an
idea
that
reaches
into
an
explanation
of
the
origin
of
motion
than
the
chemist
or
physicist
from
exact
scientific
data
can
account
for
the
creation
of
matter
give
him
any
amount
of
material
at
rest
and
he
can
not
conceive
of
any
method
by
which
motion
can
disturb
any
part
of
it
unless
such
motion
be
mass
motion
communicated
from
without
or
molecular
motion
already
existing
within
he
accounts
for
the
phases
of
present
motion
in
heavenly
bodies
not
for
the
primal
cause
of
the
actual
movements
or
intrinsic
properties
they
possess
he
can
neither
originate
a
theory
that
will
permit
of
motion
creating
itself
and
imparting
itself
to
quiescent
matter
nor
imagine
how
an
atom
of
quiescent
matter
can
be
moved
unless
motion
from
without
be
communicated
thereto
the
astronomer
i
assert
can
neither
from
any
data
at
his
command
postulate
nor
prove
the
beginning
nor
the
end
of
the
reverberating
motion
that
exists
in
his
solar
system
which
is
itself
the
fragment
of
a
system
that
is
circulating
and
revolving
in
and
about
itself
and
in
which
since
the
birth
of
man
the
universe
he
knows
has
not
passed
the
first
milestone
in
the
road
that
universe
is
traveling
in
space
immensity
the
mathematician
starts
a
line
from
an
imaginary
point
that
he
informs
us
exists
theoretically
without
occupying
any
space
which
is
a
contradiction
of
terms
according
to
his
human
acceptation
of
knowledge
derived
from
scientific
experiment
if
science
is
based
on
verified
facts
he
assumes
that
straight
lines
exist
which
is
a
necessity
for
his
calculation
but
such
a
line
he
has
never
made
even
the
beam
of
sunshine
radiating
through
a
clear
atmosphere
or
a
cloud
bank
widens
and
contracts
again
as
it
progresses
through
the
various
mediums
of
air
and
vapor
currents
and
if
it
is
ever
spreading
and
deflecting
can
it
be
straight
he
begins
his
study
in
the
unknown
it
ends
with
the
unknowable
the
biologist
can
conceive
of
no
rational
scientific
beginning
to
life
of
plant
or
animal
and
men
of
science
must
admit
the
fact
whenever
we
turn
our
attention
to
nature
laws
and
nature
substance
we
find
man
surrounded
by
the
infinity
that
obscures
the
origin
and
covers
the
end
but
perseverance
study
of
nature
forces
and
comparison
of
the
past
with
the
present
will
yet
clarify
human
knowledge
and
make
plain
much
of
this
seemingly
mysterious
but
never
will
man
reach
the
beginning
or
the
end
the
course
of
human
education
to
this
day
has
been
mostly
materialistic
although
together
with
the
study
of
matter
there
has
been
more
or
less
attention
given
to
its
moving
spirit
newton
was
the
dividing
light
in
scientific
thought
he
stepped
between
the
reasonings
of
the
past
and
the
provings
of
the
present
and
introduced
problems
that
gave
birth
to
a
new
scientific
tendency
a
change
from
the
study
of
matter
from
the
material
side
to
that
of
force
and
matter
but
his
thought
has
since
been
carried
out
in
a
mode
too
realistic
by
far
the
study
of
material
bodies
has
given
way
it
is
true
in
a
few
cases
to
the
study
of
the
spirit
of
matter
and
evolution
is
beginning
to
teach
men
that
matter
is
crude
as
a
result
thought
will
in
its
sequence
yet
show
that
modifications
of
energy
expression
are
paramount
this
work
is
not
lost
however
for
the
consideration
of
the
nature
of
sensible
material
is
preliminary
and
necessary
to
progression
as
the
life
of
the
savage
prepares
the
way
for
that
of
the
cultivated
student
and
is
a
meager
and
primitive
child
effort
compared
with
the
richness
of
the
study
in
unseen
energy
expressions
that
are
linked
with
matter
of
which
men
will
yet
learn
i
comprehend
some
of
this
i
replied
but
i
am
neither
prepared
to
assent
to
nor
dissent
from
your
conclusions
and
my
mind
is
not
clear
as
to
whether
your
logic
is
good
or
bad
i
am
more
ready
to
speak
plainly
about
my
own
peculiar
situation
than
to
become
absorbed
in
abstruse
arguments
in
science
and
i
marvel
more
at
the
soft
light
that
is
here
surrounding
us
than
at
the
metaphysical
reasoning
in
which
you
indulge
the
child
ignorant
of
letters
wonders
at
the
resources
of
those
who
can
spell
and
read
and
in
like
manner
many
obscure
natural
phenomena
are
marvelous
to
man
only
because
of
his
ignorance
you
do
not
comprehend
the
fact
that
sunlight
is
simply
a
expression
an
outburst
of
interrupted
energy
and
that
the
modification
this
energy
undergoes
makes
it
visible
or
sensible
to
man
what
think
you
becomes
of
the
flood
of
light
energy
that
unceasingly
flows
from
the
sun
for
ages
for
an
eternity
it
has
bathed
this
earth
and
seemingly
streamed
into
space
and
space
it
would
seem
must
have
long
since
have
been
filled
with
it
if
as
men
believe
space
contains
energy
of
any
description
man
may
say
the
earth
casts
the
amount
intercepted
by
it
back
into
space
and
yet
does
not
your
science
teach
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
earth
is
an
absorber
and
a
poor
radiator
of
light
and
heat
what
think
you
i
repeat
becomes
of
the
torrent
of
light
and
heat
and
other
forces
that
radiate
from
the
sun
the
flood
that
strikes
the
earth
it
disappears
and
in
the
economy
of
nature
is
not
replaced
by
any
known
force
or
any
known
motion
of
matter
think
you
that
earth
substance
really
presents
an
obstacle
to
the
passage
of
the
sun
energy
is
it
not
probable
that
most
of
this
light
producing
essence
as
a
subtle
fluid
passes
through
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
into
its
interior
as
light
does
through
space
and
returns
thence
to
the
sun
again
in
a
condition
not
discernible
by
man
he
grasped
my
arm
and
squeezed
it
as
though
to
emphasize
the
words
to
follow
you
have
used
the
term
sunshine
freely
tell
me
what
is
sunshine
ah
you
do
not
reply
well
what
evidence
have
you
to
show
that
sunshine
heat
and
light
is
not
a
condition
that
exists
locally
only
the
result
of
contact
between
matter
and
some
unknown
force
expression
what
reason
have
you
for
accepting
that
to
other
forms
unknown
and
yet
transparent
to
this
energy
your
sunshine
may
not
be
as
intangible
as
the
ether
of
space
is
to
man
what
reason
have
you
to
believe
that
a
force
torrent
is
not
circulating
to
and
from
the
sun
and
earth
inappreciable
to
man
excepting
the
mere
trace
of
this
force
which
modified
by
contact
action
with
matter
appears
as
heat
light
and
other
force
expressions
how
can
i
if
this
is
true
in
consideration
of
your
ignorance
enter
into
details
explanatory
of
the
action
that
takes
place
between
matter
and
a
portion
of
this
force
whereby
in
the
earth
first
at
the
surface
darkness
is
produced
and
then
deeper
down
an
earth
light
that
man
can
perceive
by
the
sense
of
sight
as
you
now
realize
i
will
only
say
that
this
luminous
appearance
about
us
is
produced
by
a
natural
law
whereby
the
flood
of
energy
invisible
to
man
a
something
clothed
now
under
the
name
of
darkness
after
streaming
into
the
crust
substance
of
the
earth
is
at
this
depth
revivified
and
then
is
made
apparent
to
mortal
eye
to
be
modified
again
as
it
emerges
from
the
opposite
earth
crust
but
not
annihilated
for
my
vision
however
this
central
light
is
not
a
necessity
my
physical
and
mental
development
is
such
that
the
energy
of
darkness
is
communicable
i
can
respond
to
its
touches
on
my
nerves
and
hence
i
can
guide
you
in
this
dark
cavern
i
am
all
eye
ah
i
exclaimed
that
reminds
me
of
a
remark
made
by
my
former
guide
who
referring
to
the
instinct
of
animals
spoke
of
that
as
a
natural
power
undeveloped
in
man
is
it
true
that
by
mental
cultivation
a
new
sense
can
be
evolved
whereby
darkness
may
become
as
light
yes
that
which
you
call
light
is
a
form
of
sensible
energy
to
which
the
faculties
of
animals
who
live
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
have
become
adapted
through
their
organs
of
sight
the
sun
energy
is
modified
when
it
strikes
the
surface
of
the
earth
part
is
reflected
but
most
of
it
passes
onward
into
the
earth
substance
in
an
altered
or
disturbed
condition
animal
organisms
within
the
earth
must
possess
a
peculiar
development
to
utilize
it
under
its
new
form
but
such
a
sense
is
really
possessed
in
a
degree
by
some
creatures
known
to
men
there
is
consciousness
behind
consciousness
there
are
grades
and
depths
of
consciousness
earth
worms
and
some
fishes
and
reptiles
in
underground
streams
lower
organizations
men
call
them
do
not
use
the
organ
of
sight
but
recognize
objects
seek
their
food
and
flee
from
their
enemies
they
have
no
eyes
i
exclaimed
forgetting
that
i
spoke
to
an
eyeless
being
how
can
they
see
you
should
reflect
that
man
can
not
offer
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
fact
that
he
can
see
with
his
eyes
in
one
respect
these
lower
creatures
are
higher
in
the
scale
of
life
than
man
is
for
they
see
appreciate
without
eyes
the
surfaces
of
their
bodies
really
are
sources
of
perception
and
seats
of
consciousness
man
must
yet
learn
to
see
with
his
skin
taste
with
his
fingers
and
hear
with
the
surface
of
his
body
the
dissected
nerve
or
the
pupil
of
man
eye
offers
to
the
physiologist
no
explanation
of
its
intrinsic
power
is
not
man
unfortunate
in
having
to
risk
so
much
on
so
frail
an
organ
the
physiologist
can
not
tell
why
or
how
the
nerve
of
the
tongue
can
distinguish
between
bitter
and
sweet
or
convey
any
impression
of
taste
or
why
the
nerve
of
the
ear
communicates
sound
or
the
nerve
of
the
eye
communicates
the
impression
of
sight
there
is
an
impassable
barrier
behind
all
forms
of
nerve
impressions
that
neither
the
microscope
nor
other
methods
of
investigation
can
help
the
reasoning
senses
of
man
to
remove
the
void
that
separates
the
pulp
of
the
material
nerve
from
consciousness
is
broader
than
the
solar
universe
for
even
from
the
most
distant
known
star
we
can
imagine
the
flight
of
a
ray
of
light
that
has
once
started
on
its
travels
into
space
can
any
man
outline
the
bridge
that
connects
the
intellect
with
nerve
or
brain
mind
or
with
any
form
of
matter
the
fact
that
the
surface
of
the
bodies
of
some
animals
is
capable
of
performing
the
same
functions
for
these
animals
that
the
eye
of
man
performs
for
him
is
not
more
mysterious
than
is
the
function
of
that
eye
itself
the
term
darkness
is
an
expression
used
to
denote
the
fact
that
to
the
brain
which
governs
the
eye
of
man
what
man
calls
the
absence
of
light
is
unrecognizable
if
men
were
more
magnanimous
and
less
egotistical
they
would
open
their
minds
to
the
fact
that
some
animals
really
possess
certain
senses
that
are
better
developed
than
they
are
in
man
the
teachers
of
men
too
often
tell
the
little
they
know
and
neglect
the
great
unseen
the
cat
tribe
some
night
birds
and
many
reptiles
can
see
better
in
darkness
than
in
daylight
let
man
compare
with
the
nerve
expanse
of
his
own
eye
that
of
the
highly
developed
eye
of
any
such
creature
and
he
will
understand
that
the
difference
is
one
of
brain
or
intellect
and
not
altogether
one
of
optical
vision
surface
when
men
are
able
to
explain
how
light
can
affect
the
nerves
of
their
own
eyes
and
produce
such
an
effect
on
distant
brain
tissues
as
to
bring
to
his
senses
objects
that
he
is
not
touching
he
may
be
able
to
explain
how
the
energy
in
darkness
can
affect
the
nerve
of
the
eye
in
the
owl
and
impress
vision
on
the
brain
of
that
creature
should
not
inferior
sense
of
light
lead
him
to
question
if
instead
of
deficient
visual
power
there
be
not
a
deficiency
of
the
brain
capacity
of
man
instead
of
accepting
that
the
eye
of
man
is
incapable
of
receiving
the
impression
of
night
energy
and
making
no
endeavor
to
improve
himself
in
the
direction
of
his
imperfection
man
should
reflect
whether
or
not
his
brain
may
by
proper
cultivation
or
artificial
stimulus
be
yet
developed
so
as
to
receive
yet
deeper
nerve
impressions
thereby
changing
darkness
into
daylight
until
man
can
explain
the
modus
operandi
of
the
senses
he
now
possesses
he
can
not
consistently
question
the
existence
of
a
different
sight
power
in
other
beings
and
unquestioned
existing
conditions
should
lead
him
to
hope
for
a
yet
higher
development
in
himself
this
dissertation
is
interesting
very
i
said
although
inclined
toward
agnosticism
my
ideas
of
a
possible
future
in
consciousness
that
lies
before
mankind
are
broadened
i
therefore
accept
your
reasoning
perhaps
because
i
can
not
refute
it
neither
do
i
wish
to
do
so
and
now
i
ask
again
can
not
you
explain
to
me
how
darkness
as
deep
as
that
of
midnight
has
been
revivified
so
as
to
bring
this
great
cavern
to
my
view
that
may
be
made
plain
at
a
future
time
he
answered
let
us
proceed
with
our
journey
we
passed
through
a
dry
well
ventilated
apartment
stalactite
formations
still
existed
indicative
of
former
periods
of
water
drippings
but
as
we
journeyed
onward
i
saw
no
evidence
of
present
percolations
and
the
developing
and
erosive
agencies
that
had
worked
in
ages
past
must
long
ago
have
been
suspended
the
floor
was
of
solid
stone
entirely
free
from
loose
earth
and
fallen
rocky
fragments
it
was
smooth
upon
the
surface
but
generally
disposed
in
gentle
undulations
the
peculiar
soft
radiant
light
to
which
my
guide
referred
as
vitalized
darkness
or
revivified
sunshine
pervaded
all
the
space
about
me
but
i
could
not
by
its
agency
distinguish
the
sides
of
the
vast
cavern
the
brightness
was
of
a
species
that
while
it
brought
into
distinctness
objects
that
were
near
at
hand
lost
its
unfolding
power
or
vigor
a
short
distance
beyond
i
would
compare
the
effect
to
that
of
a
bright
light
shining
through
a
dense
fog
were
it
not
that
the
medium
about
us
was
transparent
not
milky
the
light
shrunk
into
nothingness
it
passed
from
existence
behind
and
about
me
as
if
it
were
annihilated
without
wasting
away
in
the
opalescent
appearance
once
familiar
as
that
of
a
spreading
fog
moreover
it
seemed
to
detail
such
objects
as
were
within
the
compass
of
a
certain
area
close
about
me
but
to
lose
in
intensity
beyond
the
buttons
on
my
coat
appeared
as
distinct
as
they
ever
did
when
i
stood
in
the
sunlight
and
fully
larger
than
i
formerly
knew
them
to
be
the
corrugations
on
the
palms
of
my
hands
stood
out
in
bold
serpentine
relief
that
i
observed
clearly
when
i
held
my
hands
near
my
eye
my
fingers
appeared
clumsy
and
all
parts
of
my
person
were
magnified
in
proportion
the
region
at
the
limits
of
my
range
of
perception
reminded
me
of
nothingness
but
not
of
darkness
a
circle
of
obliteration
defined
the
border
of
the
luminous
belt
which
advanced
as
we
proceeded
and
closed
in
behind
us
this
line
or
rather
zone
of
demarkation
that
separated
the
seen
from
the
unseen
appeared
to
be
about
two
hundred
feet
away
but
it
might
have
been
more
or
less
as
i
had
no
method
of
measuring
distances

i
was
in

forest

colossal

chapter
xvii
the
fungus
enchantment
along
the
chamber
through
which
we
now
passed
i
saw
by
the
mellow
light
great
pillars
capped
with
covers
some
of
them
reminding
me
of
the
common
toadstool
of
upper
earth
on
a
magnificent
scale
instead
however
of
the
gray
or
somber
shades
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
these
objects
were
of
various
hues
and
combined
the
brilliancy
of
the
primary
prismatic
colors
with
the
purity
of
clean
snow
now
they
would
stand
solitary
like
gigantic
sentinels
again
they
would
be
arranged
in
rows
the
alignment
as
true
as
if
established
by
the
hair
of
a
transit
forming
columnar
avenues
and
in
other
situations
they
were
wedged
together
so
as
to
produce
masses
acres
in
extent
in
which
the
stems
became
hexagonal
by
compression
the
columnar
stems
larger
than
my
body
were
often
spiral
again
they
were
marked
with
figures
or
other
regular
geometrical
forms
in
relief
beautifully
exact
drawn
as
by
a
master
hand
in
rich
and
delicately
blended
colors
on
pillars
of
pure
alabaster
not
a
few
of
the
stems
showed
deep
crimson
blue
or
green
together
with
other
rich
colors
combined
over
which
as
delicate
as
the
rarest
of
lace
would
be
thrown
in
white
an
intricate
tracery
far
surpassing
in
beauty
of
execution
the
most
exquisite
i
had
ever
seen
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
i
was
in
a
forest
of
colossal
fungi
the
species
of
which
are
more
numerous
than
those
of
upper
earth
cryptomatic
vegetation
the
expanded
heads
of
these
great
thallogens
were
as
varied
as
the
stems
i
have
described
and
more
so
far
above
our
path
they
spread
like
beautiful
umbrellas
decorated
as
if
by
masters
from
whom
the
great
painters
of
upper
earth
might
humbly
learn
the
art
of
mixing
colors
their
under
surfaces
were
of
many
different
designs
and
were
of
as
many
shapes
as
it
is
conceivable
could
be
made
of
combinations
of
the
circle
and
hyperbola
stately
and
picturesque
silent
and
immovable
as
the
sphinx
they
studded
the
great
cavern
singly
or
in
groups
reminding
me
of
a
grown
child
wild
imagination
of
fairy
land
i
stopped
beside
a
group
that
was
of
unusual
conspicuity
and
gazed
in
admiration
on
the
huge
and
yet
graceful
beautiful
spectacle
i
placed
my
hand
on
the
stem
of
one
plant
and
found
it
soft
and
impressible
but
instead
of
being
moist
cold
and
clammy
as
the
repulsive
toadstool
of
upper
earth
i
discovered
to
my
surprise
that
it
was
pleasantly
warm
and
soft
as
velvet
smell
your
hand
said
my
guide
i
did
so
and
breathed
in
an
aroma
like
that
of
fresh
strawberries
my
guide
observed
i
had
learned
to
judge
of
his
emotions
by
his
facial
expressions
my
surprised
countenance
with
indifference
try
the
next
one
he
said
this
being
of
a
different
species
when
rubbed
by
my
hand
exhaled
the
odor
of
the
pineapple
extraordinary
i
mused
not
at
all
should
productions
of
surface
earth
have
a
monopoly
of
nature
methods
all
the
flavors
all
the
perfumes
you
may
with
equal
consistency
express
astonishment
at
the
odors
of
the
fruits
of
upper
earth
if
you
do
so
at
the
fragrance
of
these
vegetables
for
they
are
also
created
of
odorless
elements
but
toadstools
are
foul
structures
of
low
organization
they
are
neither
animals
nor
true
vegetables
but
occupy
a
station
below
that
of
plants
proper
i
said
the
fungus
polyporus
graveolens
was
neglected
by
the
guide
this
fungus
exhales
a
delicate
odor
and
is
used
in
kentucky
to
perfume
a
room
being
quite
large
it
is
employed
to
hold
a
door
open
thus
being
useful
as
well
as
j
you
are
acquainted
with
this
order
of
vegetation
under
the
most
unfavorable
conditions
out
of
their
native
elements
these
plants
degenerate
and
become
then
abnormal
often
evolving
into
the
poisonous
earth
fungi
known
to
your
woods
and
fields
here
they
grow
to
perfection
this
is
their
chosen
habitat
they
absorb
from
a
pure
atmosphere
the
combined
foods
of
plants
and
animals
and
during
their
existence
meet
no
scorching
sunrise
they
flourish
in
a
region
of
perfect
tranquillity
and
without
a
tremor
without
experiencing
the
change
of
a
fraction
of
a
degree
in
temperature
exist
for
ages
many
of
these
specimens
are
probably
thousands
of
years
old
and
are
still
growing
why
should
they
ever
die
they
have
never
been
disturbed
by
a
breath
of
moving
air
and
balanced
exactly
on
their
succulent
stems
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
dead
nitrogen
vapor
and
other
gases
with
their
roots
imbedded
in
carbonates
and
minerals
they
have

at

inexhaustible
still
i
do
not
see
why
they
grow
to
such
mammoth
proportions

themselves
to
surrounding

these
and

examples
might
be
cited
concerning
the

some

conditions
less
marked
than
between
those
that
govern

here
and
on

such
specimens
of
fungi
as
grow
in
your
former
home
have
escaped
from
these
underground
regions
and
are
as
much
out
of
place
as
are
the
tropical
plants
transplanted
to
the
edge
of

indeed
more
so
for

which
shall
yet
fulfill
a

for
they
are
destined
to
feed
tramping
multitudes
when
the
day
appears
in
which
the
nations

will
desert
the

in

sphere
i
can
not
disprove
your
statement
i
again
repeated
neither
do
i
accept
it
however
it
still
seems
to
me
unnatural
to
find
such
delicious
flavors
and
delicate
odors
connected
with
objects
associated
in
memory
with
things
insipid
or
so
disagreeable
as
toadstools

i
abhorred

once
a
weed
native
to
the
salty
edges
of
the
sea
and
as
this
weed
has
become
a
food
so
it
is
possible
for
other
wild
weeds
yet
to
do
buckwheat
is
a
weed
proper
and
not
a
cereal
and
birds
have
learned
that
the
seeds
of
many
other
weeds
are
even
preferable
to
wheat
the
wild
parsnip
is
a
poison
and
the
parsnip
of
cultivation
relapses
quickly
into
its
natural
condition
if
allowed
to
escape
and
roam
again
the
root
of
the
tapioca
plant
contains
a
volatile
poison
and
is
deadly
but
when
that
same
root
is
properly
prepared
it
becomes
the
wholesome
food
tapioca
the
nut
of
the
african
anacardium
cachew
nut
contains
a
nourishing
kernel
that
is
eaten
as
food
by
the
natives
and
yet
a
drop
of
the
juice
of
the
oily
shell
placed
on
the
skin
will
blister
and
produce
terrible
inflammations
only
those
expert
in
the
removal
of
the
kernel
dare
partake
of
the
food
the
berry
of
the
berberis
vulgaris
is
a
pleasant
acid
fruit
the
bough
that
bears
it
is
intensely
bitter
such
examples
might
be
multiplied
indefinitely
but
i
have
cited
enough
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
neither
the
difference
in
size
and
structure
of
the
species
in
the
mushroom
forest
through
which
we
are
passing
nor
the
conditions
of
these
bodies
as
compared
with
those
you
formerly
knew
need
excite
your
astonishment
cultivate
a
potato
in
your
former
home
so
that
the
growing
tuber
is
exposed
to
sunshine
and
it
becomes
green
and
acrid
and
strongly
virulent
cultivate
the
spores
of
the
fungi
about
us
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
although
now
all
parts
of
the
plants
are
edible
the
species
will
degenerate
and
may
even
become
poisonous
they
lose
their
flavor
under
such
unfavorable
conditions
and
although
some
species
still
retain
vitality
enough
to
resist
poisonous
degeneration
they
dwindle
in
size
and
adapt
themselves
to
new
and
unnatural
conditions
they
have
all
degenerated
here
they
live
on
water
pure
nitrogen
and
its
modifications
grasping
with
their
roots
the
carbon
of
the
disintegrated
limestone
affiliating
these
substances
and
evolving
from
these
bodies
rich
and
delicate
flavors
far
superior
to
the
flavor
of
earth
surface
foods
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
after
they
become
abnormal
they
live
only
on
dead
and
devitalized
organic
matter
having
lost
the
power
of
assimilating
elementary
matter
they
then
partake
of
the
nature
of
animals
breathe
oxygen
and
exhale
carbonic
acid
as
animals
do
being
the
reverse
of
other
plant
existences
here
they
breathe
oxygen
nitrogen
and
the
vapor
of
water
but
exhale
some
of
the
carbon
in
combination
with
hydrogen
thus
evolving
these
delicate
ethereal
essences
instead
of
the
poisonous
gas
carbonic
acid
their
substance
is
here
made
up
of
all
the
elements
necessary
for
the
support
of
animal
life
nitrogen
to
make
muscle
carbon
and
hydrogen
for
fat
lime
for
bone
this
fungoid
forest
could
feed
a
multitude
it
is
probable
that
in
the
time
to
come
when
man
deserts
the
bleak
earth
surface
as
he
will
some
day
be
forced
to
do
as
has
been
the
case
in
frozen
planets
that
are
not
now
inhabited
on
the
outer
crust
nations
will
march
through
these
spaces
on
their
way
from
the
dreary
outside
earth
to
the
delights
of
the
salubrious
inner
sphere
here
then
when
that
day
of
necessity
appears
as
it
surely
will
come
under
inflexible
climatic
changes
that
will
control
the
destiny
of
outer
earth
life
these
constantly
increasing
stores
adapted
to
nourish
humanity
will
be
found
accumulated
and
ready
for
food
you
have
already
eaten
of
them
for
the
variety
of
food
with
which
i
supplied
you
has
been
selected
from
different
portions
of
these
nourishing
products
which
flavored
and
salted
ready
for
use
as
food
stand
intermediate
between
animal
and
vegetable
supplying
the
place
of
both
my
instructor
placed
both
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
in
silence
i
stood
gazing
intently
into
his
face
then
in
a
smooth
captivating
entrancing
manner
he
continued
can
you
not
see
that
food
is
not
matter
the
material
part
of
bread
is
carbon
water
gas
and
earth
the
material
part
of
fat
is
charcoal
and
gas
the
material
part
of
flesh
is
water
and
gas
the
material
part
of
fruits
is
mostly
water
with
a
little
charcoal
and
gas
the
material
constituents
of
all
foods
are
plentiful
they
abound
everywhere
and
yet
amid
the
unlimited
unorganized
materials
that
go
to
form
foods
man
would
starve
by
the
term
gas
it
is
evident
that
hydrogen
and
nitrogen
were
designated
and
yet
since
the
instructor
insists
that
other
gases
form
part
of
the
atmosphere
so
he
may
consistently
imply
that
unknown
gases
are
parts
of
j
give
a
healthy
man
a
diet
of
charcoal
water
lime
salts
and
air
say
to
him
contains
no
other
substance
here
is
bread
the
material
food
of
man
live
on
this
food
and
yet
the
man
if
he
eat
of
these
will
die
with
his
stomach
distended
so
with
all
other
foods
give
man
the
unorganized
materialistic
constituents
of
food
in
unlimited
amounts
and
starvation
results
no
matter
is
not
food
but
a
carrier
of
food
what
is
food
sunshine
the
grain
of
wheat
is
a
food
by
virtue
of
the
sunshine
fixed
within
it
the
flesh
of
animals
the
food
of
living
creatures
are
simply
carriers
of
sunshine
energy
break
out
the
sunshine
and
you
destroy
the
food
although
the
material
remains
the
growing
plant
locks
the
sunshine
in
its
cells
and
the
living
animal
takes
it
out
again
hence
it
is
that
after
the
sunshine
of
any
food
is
liberated
during
the
metamorphosis
of
the
tissues
of
an
animal
although
the
material
part
of
the
food
remains
it
is
no
longer
a
food
but
becomes
a
poison
and
then
if
it
is
not
promptly
eliminated
from
the
animal
it
will
destroy
the
life
of
the
animal
this
material
becomes
then
injurious
but
it
is
still
material
the
farmer
plants
a
seed
in
the
soil
the
sunshine
sprouts
it
nourishes
the
growing
plant
and
during
the
season
locks
itself
to
and
within
its
tissues
binding
the
otherwise
dead
materials
of
that
tissue
together
into
an
organized
structure
animals
eat
these
structures
break
them
from
higher
to
lower
compounds
and
in
doing
so
live
on
the
stored
up
sunshine
and
then
excrete
the
worthless
material
side
of
the
food
the
farmer
spreads
these
excluded
substances
over
the
earth
again
to
once
more
take
up
the
sunshine
in
the
coming
plant
organization
but
not
until
it
does
once
more
lock
in
its
cells
the
energy
of
sunshine
can
it
be
a
food
for
that
animal
is
manure
a
food
he
abruptly
asked
no
is
not
manure
matter
yes
may
it
not
become
a
food
again
as
the
part
of
another
plant
when
another
season
passes
yes
in
what
else
than
energy
sunshine
does
it
differ
from
food
water
is
a
necessity
i
said
and
locked
in
each
molecule
of
water
there
is
a
mine
of
sunshine
liberate
suddenly
the
sun
energy
from
the
gases
of
the
ocean
held
in
subjection
thereby
and
the
earth
would
disappear
in
an
explosion
that
would
reverberate
throughout
the
universe
the
water
that
you
truly
claim
to
be
necessary
to
the
life
of
man
is
itself
water
by
the
grace
of
this
same
sun
for
without
its
heat
water
would
be
ice
dry
as
dust
is
the
sun
that
gives
life
and
motion
to
creatures
animate
and
substances
inanimate
he
who
doubts
distrusts
his
creator
food
and
drink
are
only
carriers
of
bits
of
assimilable
sunshine
when
the
fire
worshipers
kneeled
to
their
god
the
sun
they
worshiped
the
great
food
reservoir
of
man
when
they
drew
the
quivering
entrails
from
the
body
of
a
sacrificed
victim
they
gave
back
to
their
god
a
spark
of
sunshine
it
was
due
sooner
or
later
they
builded
well
in
thus
recognizing
the
source
of
all
life
and
yet
they
acted
badly
for
their
god
asked
no
premature
sacrifice
the
inevitable
must
soon
occur
and
as
all
organic
life
comes
from
that
so
back
to
that
creator
the
must
fly
but
they
are
heathen
there
is
a
god
beyond
their
narrow
conception
of
god
as
there
is
also
a
god
in
the
beyond
past
your
idea
of
god
perhaps
to
beings
of
higher
mentalities
we
may
be
heathen
but
even
if
this
is
so
duty
demands
that
we
revere
the
god
within
our
intellectual
sphere
let
us
not
digress
further
the
subject
now
is
food
not
the
supreme
creator
and
i
say
to
you
the
food
of
man
and
the
organic
life
of
man
is
sunshine
he
ceased
and
i
reflected
upon
his
words
all
he
had
said
seemed
so
consistent
that
i
could
not
deny
its
plausibility
and
yet
it
still
appeared
altogether
unlikely
as
viewed
in
the
light
of
my
previous
earth
knowledge
i
did
not
quite
comprehend
all
the
expressions
but
was
at
least
certain
that
i
could
neither
disprove
nor
verify
his
propositions
my
thoughts
wandered
aimlessly
and
i
found
myself
questioning
whether
man
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
live
contentedly
in
situations
such
as
i
was
now
passing
through
in
company
with
my
learned
and
philosophical
but
fantastically
created
guardian
and
monitor
i
moved
on
chapter
xix
the
cry
from
a
i
rebel
against
continuing
the
journey
as
we
paced
along
meditating
i
became
more
sensibly
impressed
with
the
fact
that
our
progress
was
down
a
rapid
declination
the
saline
incrustations
fungi
and
stalagmites
rapidly
changed
in
appearance
an
endless
variety
of
stony
figures
and
vegetable
cryptogams
recurring
successively
before
my
eyes
they
bore
the
shape
of
trees
shrubs
or
animals
fixed
and
silent
as
statues
at
least
in
my
distorted
condition
of
mind
i
could
make
out
resemblances
to
many
such
familiar
objects
the
floor
of
the
cavern
became
increasingly
steeper
as
was
shown
by
the
stalactites
which
hanging
here
and
there
from
the
invisible
ceiling
made
a
decided
angle
with
the
floor
corresponding
with
a
similar
angle
of
the
stalagmites
below
like
an
accompanying
and
encircling
halo
the
ever
present
enveloped
us
opening
in
front
as
we
advanced
and
vanishing
in
the
rear
the
sound
of
our
footsteps
gave
back
a
peculiar
indescribable
hollow
echo
and
our
voices
sounded
and
unearthly
as
if
their
origin
was
outside
of
our
bodies
and
at
a
distance
the
peculiar
resonance
reminded
me
of
noises
reverberating
in
an
empty
cask
or
cistern
i
was
oppressed
by
an
indescribable
feeling
of
mystery
and
awe
that
grew
deep
and
intense
until
at
last
i
could
no
longer
bear
the
mental
strain
hold
hold
i
shouted
or
tried
to
shout
and
stopped
suddenly
for
although
i
had
cried
aloud
no
sound
escaped
my
lips
then
from
a
distance
could
i
believe
my
senses
from
a
distance
as
an
echo
the
cry
came
back
in
the
tones
of
my
own
voice
hold
hold
speak
lower
said
my
guide
speak
very
low
for
now
an
effort
such
as
you
have
made
projects
your
voice
far
outside
your
body
the
greater
the
exertion
the
farther
away
it
appears
i
grasped
him
by
the
arm
and
said
slowly
determinedly
and
in
a
suppressed
tone
i
have
come
far
enough
into
the
secret
caverns
of
the
earth
without
knowing
our
destination
acquaint
me
now
with
the
object
of
this
mysterious
journey
i
demand
and
at
once
relieve
this
sense
of
uncertainty
otherwise
i
shall
go
no
farther
illustration
an
endless
variety
of
stony
figures
you
are
to
proceed
to
the
sphere
of
rest
with
me
he
replied
and
in
safety
beyond
that
an
unknown
country
lies
into
which
i
have
never
ventured
you
speak
in
enigmas
what
is
this
sphere
of
rest
where
is
it
your
eyes
have
never
seen
anything
similar
human
philosophy
has
no
conception
of
it
and
i
can
not
describe
it
he
said
it
is
located
in
the
body
of
the
earth
and
we
will
meet
it
about
one
thousand
miles
beyond
the
north
pole
but
i
am
in
kentucky
i
replied
do
you
think
that
i
propose
to
walk
to
the
north
pole
man
if
man
you
be
that
unreached
goal
is
thousands
of
miles
away
true
he
answered
as
you
measure
distance
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
you
could
not
walk
it
in
years
of
time
but
you
are
now
miles
below
the
surface
and
you
must
be
aware
that
instead
of
becoming
more
weary
as
we
proceed
you
are
now
and
have
for
some
time
been
gaining
strength
i
would
also
call
to
your
attention
that
you
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
proceed
i
said
is
useless
to
rebel
i
am
wholly
in
your
power
and
we
resumed
our
journey
and
rapidly
went
forward
amid
silences
that
were
to
me
painful
beyond
description
we
abruptly
entered
a
cavern
of
crystal
every
portion
of
which
was
of
sparkling
brilliancy
and
as
white
as
snow
the
stalactites
stalagmites
and
fungi
disappeared
i
picked
up
a
fragment
of
the
bright
material
tasted
it
and
found
that
it
resembled
pure
salt
monstrous
cubical
crystals
a
foot
or
more
in
diameter
stood
out
in
bold
relief
accumulations
of
them
as
conglomerated
masses
banked
up
here
and
there
making
parts
of
great
columnar
cliffs
while
in
other
formations
the
crystals
were
small
resembling
in
the
aggregate
masses
of
white
sandstone
is
not
this
salt
i
asked
yes
we
are
now
in
the
dried
bed
of
an
underground
lake
dried
bed
i
exclaimed
a
body
of
water
sealed
in
the
earth
can
not
evaporate
it
has
not
evaporated
at
some
remote
period
the
water
has
been
abstracted
from
the
salt
and
probably
has
escaped
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
as
a
fresh
water
spring
you
contradict
all
laws
of
hydrostatics
as
i
understand
that
subject
i
replied
when
you
speak
of
abstracting
water
from
a
dissolved
substance
that
is
part
of
a
liquid
and
thus
leaving
the
solids
nevertheless
this
is
a
constant
act
of
nature
said
he
how
else
can
you
rationally
account
for
the
great
salt
beds
and
other
deposits
of
saline
materials
that
exist
hermetically
sealed
beneath
the
surface
illustration
monstrous
cubical
crystals
i
will
confess
that
i
have
not
given
the
subject
much
thought
i
simply
accept
the
usual
explanation
to
the
effect
that
salty
seas
have
lost
their
water
by
evaporation
and
afterward
the
salt
formations
by
some
convulsions
of
nature
have
been
covered
with
earth
perhaps
sinking
by
earthquake
convulsions
bodily
into
the
earth
these
explanations
are
examples
of
some
of
the
erroneous
views
of
scientific
writers
he
replied
they
are
true
only
to
a
limited
extent
the
great
beds
of
salt
deep
in
the
earth
are
usually
accumulations
left
there
by
water
that
is
drawn
from
brine
lakes
from
which
the
liberated
water
often
escaped
as
pure
spring
water
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
it
does
not
escape
by
evaporation
at
least
not
until
it
reaches
the
earth
surface
interlude
the
story
interrupted
chapter
xx
my
unbidden
guest
proves
his
statement
and
refutes
my
philosophy
let
the
reader
who
has
followed
this
strange
story
which
i
am
directed
to
title
the
end
of
earth
and
who
in
imagination
has
traversed
the
cavernous
passages
of
the
underworld
and
listened
to
the
conversation
of
those
two
personages
who
journeyed
towards
the
secrets
of
the
beyond
return
now
to
upper
earth
and
once
more
enter
my
secluded
lodgings
the
home
of
llewellen
drury
him
who
listened
to
the
aged
guest
and
who
claims
your
present
attention
remember
that
i
relate
a
story
within
a
story
that
importunate
guest
of
mine
of
the
glittering
knife
and
the
silvery
hair
like
another
ancient
mariner
had
constrained
me
to
listen
to
his
narrative
as
he
read
it
aloud
to
me
from
the
manuscript
i
patiently
heard
chapter
after
chapter
generally
with
pleasure
often
with
surprise
sometimes
with
incredulity
or
downright
dissent
much
of
the
narrative
i
must
say
yes
most
of
it
appeared
possible
if
not
probable
as
taken
in
its
connected
sequence
the
scientific
sections
were
not
uninteresting
the
marvels
of
the
fungus
groves
the
properties
of
the
inner
light
i
was
not
disinclined
to
accept
as
true
to
natural
laws
but
when
came
to
tell
of
the
salt
deposits
and
to
explain
the
cause
of
the
disappearance
of
lakes
that
formerly
existed
underground
and
their
simultaneous
replacement
by
beds
of
salt
my
credulity
was
overstrained
permit
me
to
interrupt
your
narrative
i
remarked
and
then
in
response
to
my
request
the
venerable
guest
laid
down
his
paper
well
he
said
interrogatively
i
do
not
believe
that
last
statement
concerning
the
salt
lake
and
to
speak
plainly
i
would
not
have
accepted
it
as
you
did
even
had
i
been
in
your
situation
to
what
do
you
allude
he
asked
the
physical
abstraction
of
water
from
the
salt
of
a
solution
of
salt
i
do
not
believe
it
possible
unless
by
evaporation
of
the
water
you
seem
to
accept
as
conclusive
the
statements
of
men
who
have
never
investigated
beneath
the
surface
in
these
directions
and
you
question
the
evidence
of
a
man
who
has
seen
the
phenomenon
i
presume
you
accept
the
prevailing
notions
about
salt
beds
as
you
do
the
assertion
that
liquids
seek
a
common
level
which
your
scientific
authorities
also
teach
as
a
law
of
nature
yes
i
do
believe
that
liquids
seek
a
common
level
and
i
am
willing
to
credit
your
other
improbable
statements
if
you
can
demonstrate
the
principle
of
liquid
equilibrium
to
be
untrue
then
said
he
evening
i
will
show
you
that
fluids
seek
different
levels
and
also
explain
to
you
how
liquids
may
leave
the
solids
they
hold
in
solution
without
evaporating
from
them
he
arose
and
abruptly
departed
it
was
near
morning
and
yet
i
sat
in
my
room
alone
pondering
the
story
of
my
unique
guest
until
i
slept
to
dream
of
caverns
and
seances
until
daylight
when
i
was
awakened
by
their
vividness
the
fire
was
out
the
room
was
cold
and
shivering
in
nervous
exhaustion
i
crept
into
bed
to
sleep
and
dream
again
of
horrible
things
i
can
not
describe
but
which
made
me
shudder
in
affright
at
their
recollection
late
in
the
day
i
awoke
on
the
following
evening
my
persevering
teacher
appeared
punctually
and
displayed
a
few
glass
tubes
and
some
blotting
or
bibulous
paper
i
will
first
show
you
that
liquids
may
change
their
levels
in
opposition
to
the
accepted
laws
of
men
not
contrary
to
nature
laws
however
let
me
lead
to
the
experiments
by
a
statement
of
facts
that
if
you
question
you
can
investigate
at
any
time
if
two
vessels
of
water
be
connected
by
a
channel
from
the
bottom
of
each
the
water
surfaces
will
come
to
a
common
level
he
selected
a
curved
glass
tube
and
poured
water
into
it
the
water
assumed
the
position
shown
in
figure
illustration
fig
a
a
water
in
tube
seeks
a
level
you
have
not
shown
me
anything
new
i
said
my
taught
me
this
true
i
have
but
exhibited
that
which
is
the
foundation
of
your
philosophy
regarding
the
surface
of
liquids
let
me
proceed
if
we
pour
a
solution
of
common
salt
into
such
a
u
tube
as
i
do
now
you
perceive
that
it
also
rises
to
the
same
level
in
both
ends
of
course
it
does
do
not
interrupt
me
into
one
arm
of
the
tube
containing
the
brine
i
now
carefully
pour
pure
water
you
observe
that
the
surfaces
do
not
seek
the
same
level
figure
illustration
fig
a
surface
of
water
b
surface
of
brine
certainly
not
i
said
the
weight
of
the
liquid
in
each
arm
is
the
same
however
the
columns
balance
each
other
exactly
and
on
this
assumption
you
base
your
assertion
that
connected
liquids
of
the
same
gravity
must
always
seek
a
common
level
but
you
see
from
this
test
that
if
two
liquids
of
different
gravities
be
connected
from
beneath
the
surface
of
the
lighter
one
will
assume
a
higher
level
than
the
surface
of
the
heavier
agreed
however
tortuous
the
channel
that
connects
them
such
must
be
the
case
is
it
not
supposable
said
he
that
there
might
be
two
pockets
in
the
earth
one
containing
salt
water
the
other
fresh
water
which
if
joined
together
might
be
represented
by
such
a
figure
as
this
wherein
the
water
surface
would
be
raised
above
that
of
the
brine
and
he
drew
upon
the
paper
the
accompanying
diagram
figure
yes
i
admitted
providing
of
course
there
was
an
equal
pressure
of
air
on
the
surface
of
each

connecting
them
now
i
will
draw
a
figure
in
which
one
pocket
is
above
the
other
and
ask
you
to
imagine
that
in
the
lower
pocket
we
have
pure
water
in
the
upper
pocket
brine
figure
can
you
bring
any
theory
of
your
law
to
bear
upon
these
liquids
so
that
by
connecting
them
together
the
water
will
rise
and
run
into
the
brine
illustration
fig
b

the
difference
in
altitude
is
somewhat
exaggerated
to
make
the
phenomenon
clear

result
under
such
l
no
i
replied
connect
them
and
then
the
brine
will
flow
into
the
water
upon
the
contrary
he
said
connect
them
as
innumerable
cavities
in
the
earth
are
joined
and
the
water
will
flow
into
the
brine
the
assertion
is
opposed
to
applied
philosophy
and
common
sense
i
said
where
ignorance
is
bliss
is
folly
to
be
wise
you
know
to
be
a
maxim
with
mortals
he
replied
but
i
must
pardon
you
your
dogmatic
education
narrows
your
judgment
i
now
will
prove
you
in
error
he
took
from
his
pocket
two
slender
glass
tubes
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch
in
bore
and
four
inches
in
length
each
closed
at
one
end
and
stood
them
in
a
perforated
cork
that
he
placed
upon
the
table
into
one
tube
he
poured
water
and
then
dissolving
some
salt
in
a
cup
poured
brine
into
the
other
filling
both
nearly
to
the
top
figure
next
he
produced
a
short
curved
glass
tube
to
each
end
of
which
was
attached
a
strip
of
flexible
rubber
tubing
then
from
a
piece
of
blotting
paper
such
as
is
used
to
blot
ink
he
cut
a
narrow
strip
and
passed
it
through
the
arrangement
forming
the
apparatus
represented
by

c

then
he
inserted
the
two
tubes
figure
into
the
rubber
the
extremities
of
the
paper
being
submerged
in
the
liquids
producing
a
combination
that
rested
upright
in
the
cork
as
shown
by
figure
the
surfaces
of
both
liquids
were
at
once
lowered
by
reason
of
the
suction
of
the
bibulous
paper
the
water
decreasing
most
rapidly
and
soon
the
creeping
liquids
met
by
absorption
in
the
paper
the
point
of
contact
as
the
liquids
met
being
plainly
discernible
now
the
old
man
gently
slid
the
tubes
upon
each
other
raising
one
a
little
so
as
to
bring
the
surfaces
of
the
two
liquids
exactly
on
a
plane
he
then
marked
the
glass
at
the
surface
of
each
with
a
pen
observe
the
result
he
remarked
as
he
replaced
the
tubes
in
the
cork
with
their
liquid
surfaces
on
a
line
together
we
sat
and
watched
and
soon
it
became
apparent
that
the
surface
of
the
water
had
decreased
in
height
as
compared
with
that
of
the
brine
by
fixing
my
gaze
on
the
ink
mark
on
the
glass
i
also
observed
that
the
brine
in
the
opposing
tube
was
rising
i
will
call
evening
he
said
and
we
shall
then
discover
which
is
true
man
theory
or
nature
practice
within
a
short
time
enough
of
the
water
in
the
tube
had
been
transferred
to
the
brine
to
raise
its
surface
considerably
above
its
former
level
the
surface
of
the
water
being
lowered
to
a
greater
degree
figure
i
was
discomfited
at
the
result
and
upon
his
appearance
next
evening
peevishly
said
to
the
experimenter
i
do
not
know
that
this
is
fair
have
i
not
demonstrated
that
by
properly
connecting
the
liquids
the
lighter
flows
into
the
heavier
and
raises
itself
above
the
former
surface
yes
but
there
is
no
porous
paper
in
the
earth
true
i
used
this
medium
because
it
was
convenient
there
are
however
vast
subterranean
beds
of
porous
materials
stone
sand
clay
various
other
earths
many
of
which
will
answer
the
same
purpose
by
perfectly
natural
laws
on
a
large
scale
such
molecular
transfer
of
liquids
is
constantly
taking
place
within
the
earth
and
in
these
phenomena
the
law
of
gravitation
seems
ignored
and
the
rule
which
man
believes
from
narrow
experience
governs
the
flow
of
liquids
is
reversed
the
arched
porous
medium
always
transfers
the
lighter
liquid
into
the
heavier
one
until
its
surface
is
raised
considerably
above
that
of
the
light
one
in
the
same
way
you
can
demonstrate
that
alcohol
passes
into
water
sulphuric
ether
into
alcohol
and
other
miscible
light
liquids
into
those
heavier

i
have
seen
you
exemplify
the
statement
on
a
small
scale
with
water
and
brine
and
can
not
question
but
that
it
is
true
on
a
large
one
i
replied
so
you
admit
that
the
assertion
governing
the
surfaces
of
liquids
is
true
only
when
the
liquids
are
connected
from
beneath
in
other
words
your
thought
is
as
science
thought
often
is
yes
illustration
fig
e

f

surface
now
as
to
the
beds
of
salt
deep
within
the
earth
you
are
also
mistaken
concerning
their
origin
the
water
of
the
ocean
that
runs
through
an
open
channel
from
the
one
side
may
flow
into
an
underground
lake
that
by
means
of
the
contact
action
suction
of
the
overlying
and
surrounding
strata
is
being
continually
emptied
of
its
water
but
not
its
salt
thus
by
absorption
of
water
the
brine
of
the
lake
becomes
in
time
saturated
starting
crystallization
regularly
over
the
floor
and
sides
of
the
basin
eventually
the
entire
cavity
is
filled
with
salt
and
a
solid
mass
of
rock
salt
remains
if
however
before
the
lake
becomes
solid
the
brine
supply
is
shut
off
by
some
natural
cause
as
by
salt
crystals
closing
the
passage
thereto
the
underground
lake
is
at
last
drained
of
its
water
the
salt
crystallizing
over
the
bottom
and
upon
the
cliffs
leaving
great
crevices
through
the
saline
deposits
as
chances
to
have
been
the
case
with
the
salt
formations
through
which
i
passed
with
my
guide
and
have
recently
described
to
you
even
now
i
have
my
doubts
as
to
the
correctness
of
your
explanations
especially
concerning
the
liquid
surfaces
they
are
facts
however
liquids
capable
of
being
mixed
if
connected
by
porous
arches
bibulous
paper
is
convenient
for
illustrating
by
experiment
reverse
the
rule
men
have
accepted
to
explain
the
phenomena
of
liquid
equilibrium
for
i
repeat
the
lighter
one
rushes
into
that
which
is
heavier
and
the
surface
of
the
heavier
liquid
rises
you
can
try
the
experiment
with
alcohol
and
water
taking
precautions
to
prevent
evaporation
or
you
can
vary
the
experiment
with
solutions
of
various
salts
of
different
densities
the
greater
the
difference
in
gravity
between
the
two
liquids
the
more
rapid
will
be
the
flow
of
the
lighter
one
into
the
heavier
and
after
equilibrium
the
greater
will
be
the
contrast
in
the
final
height
of
the
resultant
liquid
surfaces
men
will
yet
explain
this
effect
by
natural
laws
i
said
yes
he
answered
when
they
learn
the
facts
and
they
will
then
be
able
to
solve
certain
phenomena
connected
with
diffusion
processes
that
they
can
not
now
understand
did
i
not
tell
you
that
after
the
fact
had
been
made
plain
it
was
easy
to
see
how
columbus
stood
the
egg
on
its
end
what
i
have
demonstrated
by
experiment
is
perhaps
no
new
principle
in
hydrostatics
but
i
have
applied
it
in
a
natural
manner
to
the
explanation
of
obscure
natural
phenomena
that
men
now
seek
unreasonable
methods
to
explain
you
may
proceed
with
your
narrative
i
accept
that
when
certain
liquids
are
connected
as
you
have
shown
by
means
of
porous
substances
one
will
pass
into
the
other
and
the
surface
of
the
lighter
liquid
in
this
case
will
assume
a
position
below
that
of
the
heavier
you
must
also
accept
said
he
that
when
solutions
of
salt
are
subjected
to
earth
attraction
under
proper
conditions
the
solids
may
by
capillary
attraction
be
left
behind
and
pure
water
finally
pass
through
the
porous
medium
were
it
not
for
this
law
the
only
natural
surface
spring
water
on
earth
would
be
brine
for
the
superficial
crust
of
the
earth
is
filled
with
saline
solutions
all
the
rivers
and
lakes
would
also
be
salty
and
fetid
with
sulphur
compounds
for
at
great
depths
brine
and
foul
water
are
always
present
even
in
countries
where
all
the
water
below
the
immediate
surface
of
the
earth
is
briny
the
running
springs
if
of
capillary
origin
are
pure
and
fresh
you
may
imagine
how
different
this
would
be
were
it
not
for
the
law
i
have
cited
for
the
whole
earth
crust
is
permeated
by
brine
and
saline
waters
did
your
never
lead
you
to
think
of
this
continuing
my
guest
argued
as
follows
do
not
lakes
exist
on
the
earth
surface
into
which
rivers
and
streams
flow
but
which
have
no
visible
outlet
are
not
such
lakes
saline
even
though
the
source
of
supply
is
comparatively
fresh
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
to
question
whether
capillarity
assisted
by
surface
evaporation
not
evaporation
only
as
men
assert
is
not
separating
the
water
of
these
lakes
from
the
saline
substances
carried
into
them
by
the
streams
thus
producing
brine
lakes
will
not
this
action
after
a
great
length
of
time
result
in
crystalline
deposits
over
portions
of
the
bottoms
of
such
lakes
and
ultimately
produce
a
salt
bed
it
is
possible
i
replied
not
only
possible
but
probable
not
only
probable
but
true
across
the
intervening
brine
strata
above
the
salt
crystals
the
surface
rivers
may
flow
indeed
owing
to
differences
in
specific
gravity
the
surface
of
the
lake
may
be
comparatively
fresh
while
in
the
quiet
depths
below
beds
of
salt
crystals
are
forming
and
between
these
extremes
may
rest
strata
after
strata
of
saline
solutions
decreasing
in
gravity
towards
the
top
then
he
took
his
manuscript
and
continued
to
read
in
a
clear
musical
voice
while
i
sat
a
more
contented
listener
than
i
had
been
previously
i
was
not
only
confuted
but
convinced
and
i
recalled
the
saying
of
socrates
that
no
better
fortune
can
happen
a
man
than
to
be
confuted
in
an
error
my
unbidden

continues

xxi
my
weight
disappearing
we
halted
suddenly
for
we
came
unexpectedly
to
the
edge
of
a
precipice
twenty
feet
at
least
in
depth
let
us
jump
down
said
my
guide
that
would
be
dangerous
i
answered
can
not
we
descend
at
some
point
where
it
is
not
so
deep
no
the
chasm
stretches
for
miles
across
our
path
and
at
this
point
we
will
meet
with
the
least
difficulty
besides
there
is
no
danger
the
specific
gravity
of
our
bodies
is
now
so
little
that
we
could
jump
twice
that
distance
with
impunity
i
can
not
comprehend
you
we
are
in
the
flesh
our
bodies
are
possessed
of
weight
the
concussion
will
be
violent
you
reason
again
from
the
condition
of
your
former
life
and
as
usual
are
mistaken
there
will
be
little
shock
for
as
i
have
said
our
bodies
are
comparatively
light
now
have
you
forgotten
that
your
motion
is
continuously
accelerated
and
that
without
perceptible
exertion
you
move
rapidly
this
is
partly
because
of
the
loss
of
weight
your
weight
would
now
be
only
about
fifty
pounds
if
tested
by
a
spring
balance
i
stood
incredulous
you
trifle
with
me
i
weigh
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
how
have
i
lost
weight
it
is
true
that
i
have
noticed
the
ease
with
which
we
have
recently
progressed
on
our
journey
especially
the
latter
part
of
it
but
i
attribute
this
in
part
to
the
fact
that
our
course
is

not
that
you
are
really
consuming
a
comparatively
small

of

your

face
has
become
more
smooth

your

again
natural
you
were
prematurely
aged
by
your
brothers
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
in
order
that
when
you
pass
the
line
of
gravity
you
might
be
vigorous
and
enjoying
manhood
again
had
this
aging
process
not
been
accomplished
you
would
now
have
become
as
a

many
respects

halted

me

said
i
promptly
obeyed
the
unexpected
command
and
sprung
upward
with
sufficient
force
to
carry
me
as
i
supposed
six
inches
from
the
earth
however
i
bounded
upward
fully
six
feet
my
look
of
surprise
as
i
gently
alighted
for
there
was
no
concussion
on
my
return
seemed
lost
on
my
guide
and
he
quietly
said

you
can
leap
six

excessive
exertion
or

can
not

i
fluttered
to

he
leaped
lightly
over

stood
unharmed
on
the
stony
floor
below
even
then
i
hesitated
observing
which
he
cried

your

the

did
so
and
the
fourteen
feet
of
fall
seemed
to
affect
me
as
though
i
had
become
as
light
as
cork
i
fluttered
to
the

as
a
leaf
would
fall

leaned
against
the

surprised
meditation

remarked

can
overlook

incredulity

we
leaped
over
great
inequalities
i
pondered
revolving
in
my
mind
the
fact
that
persons
had
in
mental
abstraction
passed
through
unusual
experiences
in
ignorance
of
conditions
about
them
until
their
attention
had
been
called
to
the
seen
and
yet
unnoticed
surroundings
and
they
had
then
beheld
the
facts
plainly
the
puzzle
picture
see
stares
the
eye
and
impresses
the
retina
but
is
devoid
of
character
until
the
hidden
form
is
developed
in
the
mind
and
then
that
form
is
always
prominent
to
the
eye
my
remarkably
light
step
now
that
my
attention
had
been
directed
thereto
was
constantly
in
my
mind
and
i
found
myself
suddenly
possessed
of
the
strength
of
a
man
but
with
the
weight
of
an
infant
i
raised
my
feet
without
an
effort
they
seemed
destitute
of
weight
i
leaped
about
tumbled
and
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
smooth
stone
floor
without
injury
it
appeared
that
i
had
become
the
airy
similitude
of
my
former
self
my
material
substance
having
wasted
away
without
a
corresponding
impairment
of
pinched
my
flesh
to
be
assured
that
all
was
not
a
dream
and
then
endeavored
to
convince
myself
that
i
was
the
victim
of
delirium
but
in
vain
too
sternly
my
confronted
me
as
a
reality
a
cruel
reality
a
species
of
intoxication
possessed
me
once
more
and
i
now
hoped
for
the
end
whatever
it
might
be
we
resumed
our
journey
and
rushed
on
with
increasing
rapidity
galloping
hand
in
hand
down
down
ever
downward
into
the
illuminated
crevice
of
the
earth
the
spectral
light
by
which
we
were
aureoled
increased
in
intensity
as
by
arithmetical
progression
and
i
could
now
distinguish
objects
at
a
considerable
distance
before
us
my
spirits
rose
as
if
i
were
under
the
influence
of
a
potent
stimulant
a
liveliness
that
was
the
opposite
of
my
recent
despondency
had
gained
control
and
i
was
again
possessed
of
a
delicious
mental
sensation
to
which
i
can
only
refer
as
a
most
rapturous
exhilaration
my
guide
grasped
my
hand
firmly
and
his
touch
instead
of
revolting
me
as
formerly
it
had
done
gave
pleasure
we
together
leaped
over
great
inequalities
in
the
floor
performing
these
aerial
feats
almost
as
easily
as
a
bird
flies
indeed
i
felt
that
i
possessed
the
power
of
flight
for
we
bounded
fearlessly
down
great
declivities
and
over
abysses
that
were
often
perpendicular
and
many
times
our
height
a
very
slight
muscular
exertion
was
sufficient
to
carry
us
rods
of
distance
and
almost
tiptoeing
we
skimmed
with
speed
down
the
steeps
of
that
unknown
declivity
at
length
my
guide
held
back
we
gradually
lessened
our
velocity
and
after
a
time
rested
beside
a
horizontal
substance
that
lay
before
us
apparently
a
sheet
of
glass
rigid
immovable
immeasurably
great
that
stretched
as
a
level
surface
before
us
vividly
distinct
in
the
brightness
of
an
earth
light
that
now
proved
to
be
superior
to
sunshine
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
glassy
barrier
to
our
further
progress
spread
as
a
crystal
mirror
in
front
and
vanishing
in
the
distance
shut
off

i
must
presume
to
interrupt
this
narrative
and
call
back
the
reader
thoughts
from
those
mysterious
caverns
through
which
we
have
been
tracing
the
rapid
footsteps
of
the
man
who
was
abducted
and
his
uncouth
pilot

let
us
now
see
and
hear
what
took
place
in
my
room
in
cincinnati
just
after
my
visitor
known
to
us
as
had
finished
reading
to
me
lewellyn
drury
the
custodian
of
this
manuscript
the
curious
chapter
relating
how
the
underground
explorers
lost
weight
as
they
descended
in
the
hollows
of
the
earth
my
french
clock
struck
twelve
of
its
clear
silvery
notes
before
the
reader
finished
his
stint
for
the
occasion
and
folded
his
manuscript
preparatory
to
placing
it
within
his
bosom
it
is
past
midnight
he
said
and
it
is
time
for
me
to
depart
but
i
will
come
to
you
again
within
a
year
meanwhile
during
my
absence
search
the
records
question
authorities
and
note
such
objections
as
rise
therefrom
concerning
the
statements
i
have
made
establish
or
disprove
historically
or
scientifically
any
portion
of
the
life
history
that
i
have
given
and
when
i
return
i
will
hear
what
you
have
to
say
and
meet
your
argument
if
there
is
a
doubt
concerning
the
authenticity
of
any
part
of
the
history
investigate
but
make
no
mention
to
others
of
the
details
of
our
meetings
i
sat
some
time
in
thought
then
said
i
decline
to
concern
myself
in
verifying
the
historical
part
of
your
narrative
the
localities
you
mention
may
be
true
to
name
and
it
is
possible
that
you
have
related
a
personal
history
but
i
can
not
perceive
that
i
am
interested
in
either
proving
or
disproving
it
i
will
say
however
that
it
does
not
seem
probable
that
at
any
time
a
man
can
disappear
from
a
community
as
you
claim
to
have
done
and
have
been
the
means
of
creating
a
commotion
in
his
neighborhood
that
affected
political
parties
or
even
led
to
an
unusual
local
excitement
outside
his
immediate
circle
of
acquaintances
for
a
man
is
not
of
sufficient
importance
unless
he
is
very
conspicuous
by
your
own
admission
you
were
simply
a
studious
mechanic
a
credulous
believer
in
alchemistic
vagaries
and
as
i
revolve
the
matter
over
i
am
afraid
that
you
are
now
trying
to
impose
on
my
credulity
the
story
of
a
forcible
abduction
in
the
manner
you
related
seems
to
me
incredible
and
not
worthy
of
investigation
even
had
i
the
inclination
to
concern
myself
in
your
personal
affairs
the
statements
however
that
you
make
regarding
the
nature
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
gravitation
light
instinct
and
human
senses
are
highly
interesting
and
even
plausible
as
you
artfully
present
the
subjects
i
candidly
admit
and
i
shall
take
some
pains
to
make
inquiries
concerning
the
recorded
researches
of
experts
who
have
investigated
in
that
direction
collect
your
evidence
said
he
and
i
shall
listen
to
your
views
when
i
return
he
opened
the
door
glided
away
and
i
was
alone
again

question
scientific
aristotle
ether
days
and
weeks
passed
when
the
opportunity
presented
i
consulted
chapman
the
druggist
and
student
of
science
regarding
the
nature
of
light
and
earth
who
in
turn
referred
me
to
daniel
vaughn
this
learned
man
in
reply
to
my
question
concerning
gravitation
declared
that
there
was
much
that
men
wished
to
understand
in
regard
to
this
mighty
force
that
might
yet
be
explained
but
which
may
never
become
known
to
mortal
man
the
correlation
of
forces
said
he
was
prominently
introduced
and
considered
by
a
painstaking
scientific
writer
named
joule
in
several
papers
that
appeared
between
and
and
he
was
followed
by
others
who
engaged
themselves
in
experimenting
and
theorizing
and
i
may
add
that
joule
was
indeed
preceded
in
such
thought
by
mayer
this
department
of
scientific
study
just
now
appears
of
unusual
interest
to
scientists
and
your
questions
embrace
problems
connected
with
some
phases
of
its
phenomena
we
believe
that
light
heat
and
electricity
are
mutually
convertible
in
fact
the
evidences
recently
opened
up
to
us
show
that
such
must
be
the
case
these
agencies
or
manifestations
are
now
known
to
be
so
related
that
whenever
one
disappears
others
spring
into
existence
study
the
beautiful
experiments
and
remarkable
investigations
of
sir
william
thomson
in
these
directions
and
what
of
gravitation
i
asked
observing
that
vaughn
neglected
to
include
gravitation
among
his
numerous
enumerated
forces
and
recollecting
that
the
force
gravitation
was
more
closely
connected
with
my
visitor
story
than
perhaps
were
any
of
the
others
excepting
the
mysterious
illumination
of
that
force
we
are
in
greater
ignorance
than
of
the
others
he
replied
it
affects
bodies
terrestrial
and
celestial
drawing
a
material
substance
or
pressing
to
the
earth
also
holds
we
believe
the
earth
and
all
other
bodies
in
position
in
the
heavens
thus
maintaining
the
equilibrium
of
the
planets
seemingly
gravitation
is
not
derived
from
or
sustained
by
an
external
force
or
supply
reservoir
but
is
an
intrinsic
entity
a
characteristic
of
matter
that
decreases
in
intensity
at
the
rate
of
the
square
of
the
increasing
distance
as
bodies
recede
from
each
other
or
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
however
gravitation
neither
escapes
by
radiation
from
bodies
nor
needs
to
be
replenished
so
far
as
we
know
from
without
it
may
be
compared
to
an
elastic
band
but
there
is
no
intermediate
tangible
substance
to
influence
bodies
that
are
affected
by
it
and
it
remains
in
undying
tension
unlike
all
elastic
material
substances
known
neither
losing
nor
acquiring
energy
as
time
passes
unlike
cohesion
or
chemical
attraction
it
exerts
its
influence
upon
bodies
that
are
out
of
contact
and
have
no
material
connection
and
this
necessitates
a
purely
fanciful
explanation
concerning
the
medium
that
conducts
such
influences
bringing
into
existence
the
illogical
hypothetical
fifth
ether
made
conspicuous
by
aristotle
what
of
this
ether
i
queried
it
is
a
necessity
in
science
but
intangible
undemonstrated
unknown
and
wholly
theoretical
it
is
accepted
as
an
existing
fluid
by
scientists
because
human
theory
can
not
conceive
of
a
substance
capable
of
or
explain
how
a
substance
can
be
capable
of
affecting
a
separate
body
unless
there
is
an
intermediate
medium
to
convey
force
impressions
hence
to
material
substances
aristotle
added
or
at
least
made
conspicuous
a
speculative
ether
that
he
assumed
pervades
all
space
and
all
material
bodies
as
well
in
order
to
account
for
the
passage
of
heat
and
light
to
and
from
the
sun
stars
and
planets
explain
further
i
requested
to
conceive
of
such
an
entity
we
must
imagine
a
material
that
is
more
evanescent
than
any
known
gas
even
in
its
most
diffused
condition
it
must
combine
the
solidity
of
the
most
perfect
conductor
of
heat
exceeding
any
known
body
in
this
respect
to
an
infinite
degree
with
the
transparency
of
an
absolute
vacuum
it
must
neither
create
friction
by
contact
with
any
substance
nor
possess
attraction
for
matter
must
neither
possess
weight
and
yet
carry
the
force
that
produces
weight
nor
respond
to
the
influence
of
any
chemical
agent
or
exhibit
itself
to
any
optical
instrument
it
must
be
invisible
and
yet
carry
the
force
that
produces
the
sensation
of
sight
it
must
be
of
such
a
nature
that
it
can
not
according
to
our
philosophy
affect
the
corpuscles
of
earthly
substances
while
permeating
them
without
contact
or
friction
and
yet
as
a
scientific
incongruity
it
must
act
so
readily
on
physical
bodies
as
to
convey
to
the
material
eye
the
sensation
of
sight
and
from
the
sun
to
creatures
on
distant
planets
it
must
carry
the
heat
force
thus
giving
rise
to
the
sensation
of
warmth
through
this
medium
yet
without
sensible
contact
with
it
worlds
must
move
and
planetary
systems
revolve
cutting
and
piercing
it
in
every
direction
without
loss
of
momentum
and
yet
as
i
have
said
this
ether
must
be
in
such
close
contact
as
to
convey
to
them
the
essence
that
warms
the
universe
lights
the
universe
and
must
supply
the
attractive
bonds
that
hold
the
stellar
worlds
in
position
a
nothing
in
itself
so
far
as
man
senses
indicate
the
ether
of
space
must
be
denser
than
iridium
more
mobile
than
any
known
liquid
and
stronger
than
the
finest
steel
i
can
not
conceive
of
such
an
entity
i
replied
no
neither
can
any
man
for
the
theory
is
irrational
and
can
not
be
supported
by
comparison
with
laws
known
to
man
but
the
conception
is
nevertheless
a
primary
necessity
in
scientific
study
can
man
by
any
rational
theory
combine
a
vacuum
and
a
substance
and
create
a
result
that
is
neither
material
nor
vacuity
neither
something
nor
nothing
and
yet
an
intensified
all
being
more
attenuated
than
the
most
perfect
of
known
vacuums
and
a
conductor
better
than
the
densest
metal
this
we
do
when
we
attempt
to
describe
the
scientists
ether
of
space
and
to
account
for
its
influence
on
matter
this
hypothetical
ether
is
for
want
of
a
better
theory
of
causes
as
supreme
in
philosophy
as
the
alkahest
of
the
talented
old
alchemist
van
helmont
was
in
former
times
a
universal
spirit
that
exists
in
conception
and
yet
does
not
exist
in
perception
and
of
which
modern
science
knows
as
little
as
its
speculative
promulgator
aristotle
did
we
who
pride
ourselves
on
our
exact
science
smile
at
some
of
aristotle
statements
in
other
directions
for
science
has
disproved
them
and
yet
necessity
forces
us
to
accept
this
illogical
ether
speculation
which
is
perhaps
the
most
unreasonable
of
all
theories
did
not
this
greek
philosopher
also
gravely
assert
that
the
lion
has
but
one
vertebra
in
his
neck
that
the
breath
of
man
enters
the
heart
that
the
back
of
the
head
is
empty
and
that
man
has
but
eight
ribs
aristotle
must
have
been
a
careless
observer
i
said
yes
he
answered
it
would
seem
so
and
science
bases
its
teachings
concerning
the
passage
of
all
forces
from
planet
to
planet
and
sun
to
sun
on
dicta
such
as
i
have
cited
and
no
more
reasonable
in
applied
experiment
and
i
have
been
referred
to
you
as
a
conscientious
scientific
teacher
i
said
why
do
you
speak
so
facetiously
i
am
well
enough
versed
in
what
we
call
science
to
have
no
fear
of
injuring
the
cause
by
telling
the
truth
and
you
asked
a
direct
question
if
your
questions
carry
you
farther
in
the
direction
of
force
studies
accept
at
once
that
of
the
intrinsic
constitution
of
force
itself
nothing
is
known
heat
light
magnetism
electricity
galvanism
until
recently
known
as
imponderable
bodies
are
now
considered
as
modifications
of
force
but
in
my
opinion
the
time
will
come
when
they
will
be
known
as
disturbances
disturbances
of
what
i
do
not
know
precisely
but
of
something
that
lies
behind
them
all
perhaps
creates
them
all
but
yet
is
in
essence
unknown
to
men
give
me
a
clearer
idea
of
your
meaning
it
seems
impossible
he
replied
i
can
not
find
words
in
which
to
express
myself
i
do
not
believe
that
forces
as
we
know
them
imponderable
bodies
are
as
modern
physics
defines
them
i
am
tempted
to
say
that
in
my
opinion
forces
are
disturbance
expressions
of
a
something
with
which
we
are
not
acquainted
and
yet
in
which
we
are
submerged
and
permeated
aristotle
ether
perhaps
it
seems
to
me
that
behind
all
material
substances
including
forces
there
is
an
unknown
spirit
which
by
certain
influences
may
be
ruffled
into
the
exhibition
of
an
expression
which
exhibition
of
temper
we
call
a
force
from
this
spirit
these
force
expressions
wavelets
or
disturbances
arise
and
yet
they
may
become
again
quiescent
and
again
rest
in
its
absorbing
unity
the
water
from
the
outlet
of
a

lake

over
a
gentle

in

or
quiet
undulations

musical
laughings
over
a

always

each
a
different

to

repose
again

hesitated
go
on
i
said
so
i
sometimes
have
dared
to
dream
that
gravitation
may
be
the
reservoir
that
conserves
the
energy
for
all
mundane
forces
and
that
what
we
call
modifications
of
force
are
intermediate
conditions

or
cascades

i
am

my
reasons

the

i
can
not
do
so
but
i
beg
you
to
continue
i
should
add
continued
vaughn
ignoring
my
remarks
that
we
have
established
rules
to
measure
the
force
of
gravitation
and
have
estimated
the
decrease
of
attraction
as
we
leave
the
surfaces
of
the
planets
we
have
made
comparative
estimates
of
the
weight
of
the
earth
and
planets
and
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
force
expression
of
gravitation
attains
a
maximum
at
about
the
distance
toward
the
center
of
the
earth
then
decreases
until
at
the
very
center
of
our
planet
matter
has
no
weight
this
together
with
the
rule
i
repeated
a
few
moments

is
about
all
we

we

of
gravitation
gravitation

i
can
not
imagine

mused
the

philosopher
may
also
be
an
expression
of
he
hesitated
again
forgetting
me
completely
and
leaned
his
shaggy
head
upon
his
hands
i
realized
that
his
mind
was
lost
in
conjecture
and
that
he
was
absorbed
in
the
mysteries
of
the
scientific
immensity
would
he
speak
again
i
could
not
think
of
disturbing
his
reverie

minutes
passed
in

then
he
slowly
softly
reverently
murmured

his
voice
had
gradually
lowered
and
now
it
became
inaudible
he
was
oblivious
to
my

and
had
gone
forth
from
his
own
self
he
was
lost
in
matters
celestial
and
abstractedly
continued
unintelligibly
to
mutter
to
himself
as
brushing
his

from

he
picked
up
his

placed
it
awkwardly
on

away
without

farewell
the

prematurely
shattered

uncouth
unkempt
typical

with

the

had
forgotten
the
material
part
of
man
the
physical
half
of

even
of

in
daniel
estimation
was
an
encumbrance
unworthy
of
serious
attention
his

communed
with
the
pure

and
to
him
science
was
a

of
the

perhaps

even
misstated

more

man
daniel
vaughn
was
fitted
for
a
scientific

a
position
of
the
highest
honor
but
neglected
by
man
proud
as
a
king
he
bore
uncomplainingly
privations
most
bitter
and
suffered
alone
until
finally
he
died
from

and

some
persons
are
ready
to
cry
shame
shame
at

cincinnati
others
assert
that
men
could
not
give
to
daniel
vaughn
and
since
the
first
edition
of
etidorhpa
appeared
the
undersigned
has
learned
of
one
vain
attempt
to
serve
the
interests
of
this
peculiar
man
he
would
not
beg
and
knowing
his
capacities
if
he
could
not
procure
a
position
in
which
to
earn
a
living
he
preferred
to
starve
the
only
bitterness
of
his
nature
it
is
said
went
out
against
those
who
in
his
opinion
kept
from
him
such
employment
as
returns
a
livelihood
to
scientific
men
for
he
well
knew
his
intellect
earned
for
him
such
a
right
in
cincinnati
will
the
spirit
of
that
great
man
talented
daniel
vaughn
bear
malice
against
the
people
of
the
city
in
which
none
who
knew
him
will
deny
that
he
perished
from
cold
and
privation
commemorated
is
he
not
by
a
bust
of
bronze
that
distorts
the
facts
in
that
the
garments
are
not
seedy
and
unkempt
the
figure
stooping
the
cheek
hollow
and
the
eye
pitifully
expressive
of
an
empty
stomach
that
bust
modestly
rests
in
the
public
library
he
loved
so
well
in
which
he
suffered
so
uncomplainingly
and
starved
so
patiently
i
embraced
the
first
opportunity
that
presented
itself
to
read
the
works
that
vaughn
suggested
and
sought
him
more
than
once
to
question
further
however
he
would
not
commit
himself
in
regard
to
the
possible
existence
of
other
forces
than
those
with
which
we
are
acquainted
and
when
i
interrogated
him
as
to
possibilities
in
the
study
of
obscure
force
expressions
he
declined
to
express
an
opinion
concerning
the
subject
indeed
i
fancied
that
he
believed
it
probable
or
at
least
not
impossible
that
a
closer
acquaintance
with
conditions
of
matter
and
energy
might
be
the
heirloom
of
future
scientific
students
at
last
i
gave
up
the
subject
convinced
that
all
the
information
i
was
able
to
obtain
from
other
persons
whom
i
questioned
and
whose
answers
were
prompt
and
positive
was
evolved
largely
from
ignorance
and
and
such
information
was
insufficient
to
satisfy
my
understanding
or
to
command
my
attention
after
hearing
vaughn
all
other
voices
sounded
empty
i
therefore
applied
myself
to
my
daily
tasks
and
awaited
the
promised
return
of
the
interesting
though
inscrutable
being
whose
subterranean
sojourneying
was
possibly
fraught
with
so
much
potential
value
to
science
and
to
man
the
unbidden
guest
returns
to
read
his
manuscript
continuing
his
narrative
chapter
xxv
the
mother
of
a
you
can
not
disprove
and
you
dare
not
admit
a
year
from
the
evening
of
the
departure
of
the
old
man
found
me
in
my
room
expecting
his
presence
and
i
was
not
surprised
when
he
opened
the
door
and
seated
himself
in
his
accustomed
chair
are
you
ready
to
challenge
my
statements
he
said
taking
up
the
subject
as
though
our
conversation
had
not
been
interrupted
no
do
you
accept
my
history
no
you
can
not
disprove
and
you
dare
not
admit
is
not
that
your
predicament
he
asked
you
have
failed
in
every
endeavor
to
discredit
the
truth
and
your
scientists
much
as
they
would
like
to
do
so
can
not
serve
you
now
we
will
continue
the
narrative
and
i
shall
await
your
next
attempt
to
cast
a
shadow
over
the
facts
then
with
his
usual
pleasant
smile
he
read
from
his
manuscript
a
continuation
of
the
journey
as
follows
be
seated
said
my
eyeless
guide
and
i
will
explain
some
facts
that
may
prove
of
interest
in
connection
with
the
nature
of
the
superficial
crust
of
the
earth
this
crystal
liquid
spreading
before
us
is
a
placid
sheet
of
water
and
is
the
feeder
of
the
volcano
mount
epomeo
can
that
be
a
surface
of
water
i
interrogated
i
find
it
hard
to
realize
that
water
can
be
so
immovable
i
supposed
the
substance
before
us
to
be
a
rigid
material
like
glass
perhaps
there
is
no
wind
to
ruffle
this
aqueous
surface
why
should
it
not
be
quiescent
this
is
the
only
perfectly
smooth
sheet
of
water
that
you
have
ever
seen
it
is
in
absolute
rest
and
thus
appears
a
rigid
level
plane
grant
that
your
explanation
is
correct
i
said
yet
i
can
not
understand
how
a
quiet
lake
of
water
can
give
rise
to
a
convulsion
such
as
the
eruption
of
a
volcano
not
only
is
this
possible
he
responded
but
water
usually
causes
the
exhibition
of
phenomena
known
as
volcanic
action
the
island
of
ischia
in
which
the
volcanic
crater
epomeo
is
situated
is
connected
by
a
tortuous
crevice
with
the
peaceful
pool
by
which
we
now
stand
and
at
periods
separated
by
great
intervals
of
time
the
lake
is
partly
emptied
by
a
simple
natural
process
and
a
part
of
its
water
is
expelled
above
the
earth
surface
in
the
form
of
steam
which
escapes
through
that
distant
crater
but
i
see
no
evidence
of
heat
or
even
motion
of
any
kind
not
here
he
replied
in
this
place
there
is
none
the
energy
is
developed
thousands
of
miles
away
but
since
the
phenomena
of
volcanic
action
are
to
be
partially
explained
to
you
at
a
future
day
i
will
leave
that
matter
for
the
present
we
shall
cross
this
lake
i
observed
as
we
walked
along
its
edge
that
the
shore
of
the
lake
was
precipitous
in
places
again
formed
a
gradually
descending
beach
and
the
dead
silence
of
the
space
about
us
in
connection
with
the
stillness
of
that
rigid
mass
of
water
and
its
surroundings
became
increasingly
impressive
and
never
before
had
i
seen
such
a
perfectly
quiet
surface
not
a
vibration
or
undulation
appeared
in
any
direction
the
solidity
of
steel
was
exemplified
in
its
steady
apparently
inflexible
contour
and
yet
the
pure
element
was
so
transparent
that
the
bottom
of
the
pool
was
as
clearly
defined
as
the
top
of
the
cavern
above
me
the
lights
and
shades
of
the
familiar
lakes
of
western
new
york
were
wanting
here
and
it
suddenly
came
to
my
mind
that
there
were
surface
reflections
but
no
shadows
and
musing
on
this
extraordinary
fact
i
stood
motionless
on
a
jutting
cliff
absorbed
in
meditation
abstractedly
gazing
down
into
that
transparent
depth
without
sun
or
moon
without
apparent
source
of
light
and
yet
perfectly
illuminated
the
lofty
caverns
seemed
cut
by
that
aqueous
plane
into
two
sections
one
above
and
one
below
a
transparent
rigid
surface
line
the
dividing
line
or
horizontal
plane
appeared
as
much
a
surface
of
air
as
a
surface
of
water
and
the
material
above
that
plane
seemed
no
more
nor
less
a
gas
or
liquid
than
that
beneath
it
if
two
limpid
transparent
liquids
immiscible
but
of
different
gravities
be
poured
into
the
same
vessel
the
line
of
demarkation
will
be
as
a
brilliant
mirror
such
as
i
now
beheld
parting
and
yet
uniting
the
surfaces
of
air
and
water
lost
in
contemplation
i
unconsciously
asked
the
mental
question
where
are
the
shadows
my
guide
replied
you
have
been
accustomed
to
lakes
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
water
that
is
illuminated
from
above
now
you
see
by
a
light
that
is
developed
from
within
and
below
as
well
as
from
above
there
is
no
outside
point
of
illumination
for
the
light
of
this
cavern
as
you
know
is
neither
transmitted
through
an
overlying
atmosphere
nor
radiated
from
a
luminous
center
it
is
an
inherent
quality
and
as
objects
above
us
and
within
the
lake
are
illuminated
alike
from
all
sides
there
can
be
no
shadows
musingly
i
said
that
which
has
occurred
before
in
this
journey
to
the
unknown
country
of
which
i
have
been
advised
seemed
mysterious
but
each
succeeding
step
discovers
to
me
another
novelty
that
is
more
mysterious
with
phenomena
that
are
more
obscure
this
phenomenon
is
not
more
of
a
mystery
than
is
the
fact
that
light
radiates
from
the
sun
man
can
not
explain
that
and
i
shall
not
now
attempt
to
explain
this
both
conditions
are
attributes
of
force
but
with
this
distinction
the
crude
light
and
heat
of
the
sun
such
as
men
experience
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
is
here
refined
and
softened
and
the
characteristic
glare
and
harshness
of
the
light
that
is
known
to
those
who
live
on
the
earth
surface
is
absent
here
the
solar
ray
after
penetrating
the
earth
crust
is
tempered
and
refined
by
agencies
which
man
will
yet
investigate
understandingly
but
which
he
can
not
now
comprehend

came
to
a
metal
boat
am
i
destined
to
deal
with
these
problems
only
in
part
are
still
greater
wonders
before
us
if
your
courage
is
sufficient
to
carry
you
onward
you
have
yet
to
enter
the
portal
of
the
expanse
we
approach
lead
on
my
friend
i
cried
lead
on
to
these
undescribed
scenes
the
occult
wonderland
that
he
interrupted
me
almost
rudely
and
in
a
serious
manner
said
have
you
not
learned
that
wonder
is
an
exemplification
of
ignorance
the
child
wonders
at
a
goblin
story
the
savage
at
a
trinket
the
man
of
science
at
an
unexplained
manifestation
of
a
previously
unperceived
natural
law
each
wonders
in
ignorance
because
of
ignorance
accept
now
that
all
you
have
seen
from
the
day
of
your
birth
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
to
the
present
and
all
that
you
will
meet
here
are
wonderful
only
because
the
finite
mind
of
man
is
confused
with
fragments
of
evidence
that
from
whatever
direction
we
meet
them
spring
from
an
unreachable
infinity
we
will
continue
our
journey
proceeding
farther
along
the
edge
of
the
lake
we
came
to
a
metallic
boat
this
my
guide
picked
up
as
easily
as
though
it
were
of
paper
for
be
it
remembered
that
gravitation
had
slackened
its
hold
here
placing
it
upon
the
water
he
stepped
into
it
and
as
directed
i
seated
myself
near
the
stern
my
face
to
the
bow
my
back
to
the
shore
the
guide
directly
in
front
of
me
gently
and
very
slowly
moved
a
small
lever
that
rested
on
a
projection
before
him
and
i
gazed
intently
upon
him
as
we
sat
together
in
silence
at
last
i
became
impatient
and
asked
him
if
we
would
not
soon
begin
our
journey
we
have
been
on
our
way
since
we
have
been
seated
he
answered
i
gazed
behind
with
incredulity
the
shore
had
disappeared
and
the
diverging
wake
of
the
ripples
showed
that
we
were
rapidly
skimming
the
water
this
is
marvelous
i
said
incomprehensible
for
without
sail
or
oar
wind
or
steam
we
are
fleeing
over
a
lake
that
has
no
current
true
but
not
marvelous
motion
of
matter
is
a
result
of
disturbance
of
energy
connected
therewith
is
it
not
scientifically
demonstrated
at
least
in
theory
that
if
the
motion
of
the
spirit
that
causes
the
magnetic
needle
to
assume
its
familiar
position
were
really
arrested
in
the
substance
of
the
needle
either
the
metal
would
fuse
and
vaporize
or
if
the
forces
did
not
appear
in
some
other
form
such
as
heat
electricity
magnetism
or
other
force
the
needle
would
be
hurled
onward
with
great
speed
chapter

motion
from
inherent
lead
me
deeper
into
this
expanding
study
i
partly
comprehend
that
such
would
be
the
case
i
said
if
a
series
of
knife
blades
on
pivot
ends
be
set
in
a
frame
and
turned
edgewise
to
a
rapid
current
of
water
the
swiftly
moving
stream
flows
through
this
sieve
of
metallic
edges
about
as
easily
as
if
there
were
no
obstructions
slowly
turn
the
blades
so
as
to
present
their
oblique
sides
to
the
current
and
an
immediate
pressure
is
apparent
upon
the
frame
that
holds
them
turn
the
blades
so
as
to
shut
up
the
space
and
they
will
be
torn
from
their
sockets
or
the
entire
frame
will
be
shattered
into
pieces
i
understand
go
on
the
ethereal
current
that
generates
the
magnetic
force
passes
through
material
bodies
with
inconceivable
rapidity
and
the
molecules
of
a
few
substances
only
present
to
it
the
least
obstruction
material
molecules
are
edgewise
in
it
and
meet
no
retardation
in
the
subtle
flood
this
force
is
a
disturbance
of
space
energy
that
is
rushing
into
the
earth
in
one
form
and
out
of
it
in
another
but
your
mind
is
not
yet
in
a
condition
to
grasp
the
subject
for
at
best
there
is
no
method
of
explaining
to
men
that
which
their
experimental
education
has
failed
to
prepare
them
to
receive
and
for
which
first
absolutely
new
ideas
and
next
words
with
new
meaning
must
be
formed
now
we
by
we
i
mean
those
with
whom
i
am
connected
have
learned
to
disturb
the
molecules
in
matter
so
as
to
turn
them
partly
or
entirely
across
the
path
of
this
magnetic
current
and
thus
interrupt
the
motion
of
this
energy
we
can
retard
its
velocity
without
however
producing
either
magnetism
as
is
the
case
in
a
bar
of
steel
electricity
or
heat
but
motion
instead
and
thus
a
portion
of
this
retarded
energy
springs
into
its
new
existence
as
motion
of
my
boat
it
is
force
changed
into
movement
of
matter
for
the
molecules
of
the
boat
as
a
mass
must
move
onward
as
the
force
disappears
as
a
current
perhaps
you
can
accept
now
that
instead
of
light
heat
electricity
magnetism
and
gravitation
being
really
modifications
of
force
they
are
disturbances
disturbances
of
what
disturbances
of
motion
motion
of
what
motion
of
itself
pure
and
simple
i
can
not
comprehend
i
can
not
conceive
of
motion
pure
and
simple
i
will
explain
at
a
future
time
so
that
you
can
comprehend
more
clearly
other
lessons
must
come
first
but
never
will
you
see
the
end
truth
is
infinite
continuing
he
said
let
me
ask
if
there
is
anything
marvelous
in
this
statement
on
the
earth
surface
men
arrest
the
fitful
wind
and
by
so
doing
divert
the
energy
of
its
motion
into
movement
of
machinery
they
induce
it
to
turn
mills
and
propel
vessels
this
motion
of
air
is
a
disturbance
mass
motion
transmitted
to
the
air
by
heat
heat
in
turn
being
a
disturbance
or
interruption
of
pure
motion
when
men
learn
to
interrupt
this
unperceived
stream
of
energy
so
as
to
change
directly
into
material
motion
the
spirit
that
saturates
the
universe
and
that
produces
force
expressions
as
it
is
constantly
rushing
from
earth
into
space
and
from
space
back
again
they
will
have
at
command
wherever
they
may
be
an
endless
source
of
power
light
and
heat
mass
motion
light
and
heat
being
convertible
motion
lies
behind
heat
light
and
electricity
and
produces
them
and
so
long
as
the
earth
revolves
on
its
axis
and
circles
in
its
orbit
man
needs
no
light
and
heat
from
such
indirect
sources
as
combustion
men
will
however
yet
obtain
motion
of
molecules
heat
and
material
mass
motion
as
well
from
earth
motion
without
the
other
dangerous
intermediate
force
expressions
now
deemed
necessary
in
their
production
do
you
wish
me
to
understand
that
on
all
parts
of
the
earth
surface
there
is
a
continual
expenditure
of
energy
an
current
that
is
really
distinct
from
the
light
and
heat
of
the
sun
and
also
that
the
imponderable
bodies
that
we
call
heat
light
electricity
and
magnetism
are
not
substances
at
all
yes
he
replied
and
that
this
imperceptible
something
fluid
i
will
say
for
want
of
a
better
term
now
invisible
and
unknown
to
man
is
as
a
medium
in
which
the
earth
submerged
floats
as
a
speck
of
dust
in
a
flood
of
space
certainly
he
replied
am
i
to
infer
from
your
remarks
that
in
the
course
of
time
man
will
be
able
to
economize
this
force
and
adapt
it
to
his
wants
yes
go
on
with
your
exposition
i
again
beg
of
you
lead
me
deeper
into
this
expanding
study
there
is
but
little
more
that
you
can
comprehend
now
as
i
have
said
he
answered
all
materials
known
to
man
are
of
coarse
texture
and
the
minds
of
men
are
not
yet
in
a
condition
to
comprehend
finer
exhibitions
of
force
or
of
motion
modifications
pure
energy
in
all
its
modifications
is
absolutely
unknown
to
man
what
men
call
heat
gravitation
light
electricity
and
magnetism
are
the
grosser
attributes
attending
alterations
in
an
unknown
attenuated
highly
developed
force
producer
they
are
results
not
causes
the
real
force
an
unreached
energy
is
now
flooding
all
space
pervading
all
materials
everywhere
there
exists
an
infinite
sea
of
motion
absolute
since
this
primeval
entity
can
not
now
affect
matter
as
matter
is
known
to
man
man
sense
can
only
be
influenced
by
secondary
attributes
of
this
energy
unconscious
of
its
presence
however
man
is
working
towards
the
power
that
will
some
day
upon
the
development
of
latent
senses
open
to
him
this
new
world
then
at
last
he
will
move
without
muscular
exertion
or
the
use
of
heat
as
an
agent
of
motion
and
will
as
i
am
now
doing
bridle
the
motion
of
space
wherever
he
may
be
situated
there
will
then
be
warmth
to
any
degree
that
he
wishes
for
he
will
be
able
to
temper
the
seasons
and
mass
motion
illimitable
also
for
this
energy
i
reiterate
is
omnipresent
however
as
you
will
know
more
of
this
before
long
we
will
pass
the
subject
for
the
present
my
guide
slowly
moved
the
lever
i
sat
in
deep
reflection
beginning
to
comprehend
somewhat
of
his
reasoning
and
yet
my
mind
was
more
than
clouded
the
several
ambiguous
repetitions
he
had
made
since
our
journey
commenced
each
time
suggesting
the
same
idea
clothing
it
in
different
forms
of
expression
impressed
me
vaguely
with
the
conception
of
a
certain
something
for
which
i
was
gradually
being
prepared
and
that
i
might
eventually
be
educated
to
grasp
but
which
he
believed
my
mind
was
not
yet
ready
to
receive
i
gathered
from
what
he
said
that
he
could
have
given
clearer
explanations
than
he
was
now
doing
and
that
he
clothed
his
language
intentionally
in
mysticism
and
that
for
some
reason
he
preferred
to
leave
my
mind
in
a
condition
of
uncertainty
the
velocity
of
the
boat
increased
as
he
again
and
again
cautiously
touched
the
lever
and
at
last
the
responsive
craft
rose
nearly
out
of
the
water
and
skimmed
like
a
bird
over
its
surface
there
was
no
object
in
that
lake
of
pure
crystal
to
govern
me
in
calculating
as
to
the
rapidity
of
our
motion
and
i
studied
to
evolve
a
method
by
which
i
could
time
our
movements
with
this
object
in
view
i
tore
a
scrap
from
my
clothing
and
tossed
it
into
the
air
it
fell
at
my
feet
as
if
in
a
calm
there
was
no
breeze
i
picked
the
fragment
up
in
bewilderment
for
i
had
expected
it
to
fall
behind
us
then
it
occurred
to
me
as
by
a
flash
that
notwithstanding
our
apparently
rapid
motion
there
was
an
entire
absence
of
atmospheric
resistance
what
could
explain
the
paradox
i
turned
to
my
guide
and
again
tossed
the
fragment
of
cloth
upward
and
again
it
settled
at
my
feet
he
smiled
and
answered
my
silent
inquiry
there
is
a
protecting
sheet
before
us
radiating
from
the
bow
of
our
boat
as
if
a
large
pane
of
glass
were
resting
on
edge
thus
shedding
the
force
of
the
wind
this
diaphragm
catches
the
attenuated
atmosphere
and
protects
us
from
its
friction
but
i
see
no
such
protecting
object
i
answered
no
it
is
invisible
you
can
not
see
the
obstructing
power
for
it
is
really
a
gyrating
section
of
force
and
is
colorless
that
spray
of
metal
on
the
brow
of
our
boat
is
the
developer
of
this
protecting
medium
imagine
a
transverse
section
of
an
eddy
of
water
on
edge
before
us
and
you
can
form
a
comparison
throw
the
bit
of
garment
as
far
as
you
can
beyond
the
side
of
the
boat
i
did
so
and
saw
it
flutter
slowly
away
to
a
considerable
distance
parallel
with
our
position
in
the
boat
as
though
in
a
perfect
calm
and
then
it
disappeared
it
seemed
to
have
been
dissolved
i
gazed
at
my
guide
in
amazement
try
again
said
he
illustration
the
bit
of
garment
fluttered
listlessly
away
to
the
same
distance
and
then
vacancy
i
tore
another
and
a
larger
fragment
from
my
coat
sleeve
i
fixed
my
eyes
closely
upon
it
and
cast
it
from
me
the
bit
of
garment
fluttered
listlessly
away
to
the
same
distance
and
then
vacancy
wonders
of
wonderland
mysteries
of
the
mysterious
what
would
be
the
end
of
this
marvelous
journey
suspicion
again
possessed
me
and
distrust
arose
could
not
my
be
blotted
out
in
like
manner
i
thought
again
of
my
new
york
home
and
the
recollection
of
upper
earth
and
those
broken
family
ties
brought
to
my
heart
a
flood
of
bitter
emotions
i
inwardly
cursed
the
writer
of
that
alchemistic
letter
and
cursed
myself
for
heeding
the
contents
the
tears
gushed
from
my
eyes
and
trickled
through
my
fingers
as
i
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
and
groaned
aloud
then
with
a
gentle
touch
my
guide
hand
rested
on
my
shoulder
calm
yourself
he
said
this
phenomenon
is
a
natural
sequence
to
a
deeper
study
of
nature
than
man
has
reached
it
is
simply
the
result
of
an
exhibition
of
rapid
motion
you
are
upon
a
great
underground
lake
that
on
a
shelf
of
earth
substance
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
below
the
earth
surface
covers
an
area
of
many
thousand
square
miles
and
which
has
an
average
depth
of
five
miles
we
are
now
crossing
it
diagonally
at
a
rapid
rate
by
the
aid
of
the
force
that
man
will
yet
use
in
a
perfectly
natural
manner
on
the
rough
upper
ocean
and
bleak
lands
of
the
earth
coarse
surface
the
fragments
of
cloth
disappeared
from
sight
when
thrown
beyond
the
influence
of
our
protecting
diaphragm
because
when
they
struck
the
outer
motionless
atmosphere
they
were
instantly
left
behind
the
eye
could
not
catch
their
sudden
change
in
motion
a
period
of
time
is
necessary
to
convey
from
eye
to
mind
the
sensation
of
sight
the
bullet
shot
from
a
gun
is
invisible
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
eye
can
not
discern
the
momentary
interruption
to
the
light
a
cannon
ball
will
compass
the
field
of
vision
of
the
eye
moving
across
it
without
making
itself
known
and
yet
the
fact
does
not
excite
surprise
we
are
traveling
so
fast
that
small
stationary
objects
outside
our
track
are
invisible
then
in
a
kind
pathetic
tone
of
voice
he
said
an
important
lesson
you
should
learn
i
have
mentioned
it
before
whatever
seems
to
be
mysterious
or
marvelous
is
only
so
because
of
the
lack
of
knowledge
of
associated
natural
phenomena
and
connected
conditions
all
that
you
have
experienced
all
that
you
have
yet
to
meet
in
your
future
journey
is
as
i
have
endeavored
to
teach
you
in
exact
accordance
with
the
laws
that
govern
the
universe
of
which
the
earth
constitutes
so
small
a
portion
that
were
the
conditions
favorable
it
could
be
blotted
from
its
present
existence
as
quickly
as
that
bit
of
garment
disappeared
and
with
as
little
disturbance
of
the
mechanism
of
the
moving
universe
i
leaned
over
resting
my
face
upon
my
elbow
my
thoughts
were
immethodically
wandering
in
the
midst
of
multiplying
perplexities
i
closed
my
eyes
as
a
weary
child
and
slept
chapter
xxvii
sleep
dreams
strangle
the
life
from
my
body
i
know
not
how
long
i
sat
wrapped
in
slumber
even
if
my
body
had
not
been
wearing
away
as
formerly
my
mind
had
become
excessively
wearied
i
had
existed
in
a
state
of
abnormal
mental
intoxication
far
beyond
the
period
of
accustomed
wakefulness
and
had
taxed
my
mental
organization
beyond
endurance
in
the
midst
of
events
of
the
most
startling
description
i
had
abruptly
passed
into
what
was
at
its
commencement
the
sweetest
sleep
of
my
recollection
but
which
came
to
a
horrible
termination
in
my
dream
i
was
transported
once
more
to
my
native
land
and
roamed
in
freedom
throughout
the
streets
of
my
lost
home
i
lived
over
again
my
early
life
in
virginia
and
i
seemed
to
have
lost
all
recollection
of
the
weird
journey
which
i
had
lately
taken
my
subsequent
connection
with
the
brotherhood
of
alchemists
and
the
unfortunate
letter
that
led
to
my
present
condition
were
forgotten
there
came
no
thought
suggestive
of
the
train
of
events
that
are
here
chronicled
and
as
a
child
i
tasted
again
the
pleasures
of
innocence
the
joys
of
boyhood
then
my
dream
of
childhood
vanished
and
the
scenes
of
later
days
spread
themselves
before
me
i
saw
after
a
time
the
scenes
of
my
later
life
as
though
i
viewed
them
from
a
distance
and
was
impressed
with
the
idea
that
they
were
not
real
but
only
the
fragments
of
a
dream
i
shuddered
in
my
childish
dreamland
and
trembled
as
a
child
would
at
confronting
events
of
the
real
life
that
i
had
passed
through
on
earth
and
that
gradually
assuming
the
shape
of
man
approached
and
stood
before
me
a
hideous
specter
seemingly
ready
to
absorb
me
the
peaceful
child
in
which
i
existed
shrunk
back
and
recoiled
from
the
approaching
living
man
away
away
i
cried
you
shall
not
grasp
me
i
do
not
wish
to
become
a
man
this
can
not
must
not
be
the
horrible
end
to
a
sweet
existence
gradually
the
man
life
approached
seized
and
enveloped
me
closing
around
me
as
a
jelly
fish
surrounds
its
living
victim
while
the
horrors
of
a
nightmare
came
over
my
soul
man
life
is
a
fearful
dream
i
shouted
as
i
writhed
in
agony
i
am
still
a
child
and
will
remain
one
keep
off
life
of
man
away
let
me
live
and
die
a
child
the
specter
of
man
life
seized
me
more
firmly
as
i
struggled
to
escape
and
holding
me
in
its
irresistible
clutch
absorbed
my
substance
as
a
vampire
might
suck
the
blood
of
an
infant
and
while
the
childish
dream
disappeared
in
that
hideous
embrace
the
miserable
man
awoke
i
found
myself
on
land
the
guide
seated
at
my
side
remarked
you
have
slept
i
have
lived
again
i
said
in
bitterness
you
have
not
lived
at
all
as
yet
he
replied
life
is
a
dream
usually
it
is
an
unsatisfied
nightmare
then
let
me
dream
again
as
at
the
beginning
of
this
slumber
i
said
and
while
i
dream
as
a
child
do
you
strangle
the
life
from
my
body
spare
me
the
nightmare
i
would
not
live
to
reach
the
life
of
man
this
is
sarcasm
he
replied
you
are
as
changeable
as
the
winds
of
the
earth
surface
now
as
you
are
about
to
approach
a
part
of
our
journey
where
fortitude
is
necessary
behold
you
waver
as
a
little
child
might
nerve
yourself
the
trials
of
the
present
require
a
steady
mind
let
the
future
care
for
itself
you
can
not
recall
the
past
i
became
attentive
again
the
depressing
effects
of
that
repulsive
dream
rapidly
lifted
and
wasted
away
as
i
realized
that
i
was
a
man
and
was
destined
to
see
more
than
can
be
seen
in
the
future
of
other
mortals
this
elevation
of
my
spirit
was
evidently
understood
by
my
guide
he
turned
to
the
lake
and
pointing
to
its
quiet
bosom
remarked
for
five
hours
we
have
journeyed
over
this
sheet
of
water
at
the
average
rate
of
nine
hundred
miles
an
hour
at
the
time
you
threw
the
fragments
of
cloth
overboard
we
were
traveling
at
a
speed
of
not
less
than
twenty
miles
per
minute
you
remember
that
some
hours
ago
you
criticised
my
assertion
when
i
said
that
we
would
soon
be
near
the
axis
of
the
earth
beneath
the
north
pole
and
now
we
are
beyond
that
point
and
are
about
six
thousand
miles
from
where
we
stood
at
that
time
you
must
have
your
way
i
replied
i
can
not
disprove
your
assertion
but
were
it
not
that
i
have
passed
through
so
many
marvelous
experiences
since
first
we
met
i
would
question
the
reliability
of
your
information
my
guide
continued
the
surface
of
this
lake
lies
as
a
mirror
beneath
both
the
ocean
and
the
land
the
force
effect
that
preserves
the
configuration
of
the
ocean
preserves
the
form
of
this
also
but
influences
it
to
a
less
extent
and
the
two
surfaces
lie
nearly
parallel
with
each
other
this
one
being
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
beneath
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
shell
of
the
earth
above
us
is
honeycombed
by
caverns
in
some
places
in
others
it
is
compact
and
yet
in
most
places
is
impervious
to
water
at
the
farther
extremity
of
the
lake
a
stratum
of
porous
material
extends
through
the
space
intervening
between
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
and
this
lake
by
capillary
attraction
assisted
by
gravitation
part
of
the
water
of
the
ocean
is
being
transferred
through
this
stratum
to
the
underground
cavity
the
lake
is
slowly
rising
at
this
remark
i
interrupted
him
you
say
the
water
in
the
ocean
is
being
slowly
transferred
down
to
this
underground
lake
less
by
gravity
than
by
capillarity
yes
i
believe
that
i
have
reason
to
question
that
statement
if
you
do
not
include
the
salt
i
replied
pray
state
your
objections
i
answered
whether
a
tube
be
long
or
short
if
it
penetrate
the
bottom
of
a
vessel
of
brine
and
extend
downward
the
brine
will
flow
into
and
out
of
it
by
reason
of
its
weight
you
mistake
he
asserted
the
attraction
of
the
sides
of
the
capillary
tube
if
the
tube
is
long
enough
will
eventually
separate
the
water
from
the
salt
and
at
length
a
downward
flow
of
water
only
will
result
i
again
expressed
my
incredulity
more
than
this
by
perfectly
natural
laws
the
water
that
is
freed
from
the
tubes
might
again
force
itself
upward
perfectly
fresh
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
yes
under
proper
conditions
above
the
surface
of
the
ocean
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
i
said
is
it
not
that
a
fountain
can
not
rise
above
its
source
it
often
does
he
answered
you
trifle
with
me
i
said
acrimoniously
no
he
replied
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
have
you
never
heard
of
what
men
call
artesian
wells
yes
and
here
i
attempted
in
turn
to
become
sarcastic
have
you
never
learned
that
they
are
caused
by
water
flowing
into
crevices
in
uplands
where
layers
of
stone
or
of
clay
strata
separated
by
sand
or
gravel
slant
upward
the
water
conducted
thence
by
these
channels
afterwards
springs
up
in
the
valleys
to
which
it
has
been
carried
by
means
of
the
crevices
in
these
strata
but
it
never
rises
above
its
source
to
my
surprise
he
answered
this
is
another
of
man
scientific
speculations
based
on
some
facts
it
is
true
and
now
and
then
correct
but
not
invariably
the
water
of
an
artesian
well
on
an
elevated
plane
may
flow
into
the
earth
from
a
creek
pond
or
river
that
is
lower
than
the
mouth
of
the
well
it
feeds
and
still
it
may
spout
into
the
air
from
either
a
near
or
distant
elevation
that
is
higher
than
its
source
i
can
not
admit
the
truth
of
this
i
said
i
am
willing
to
listen
to
reason
but
such
statements
as
these
seem
altogether
absurd
as
you
please
he
replied
we
will
continue
our
journey
the
story
interrupted
chapter
xxviii
a
my
unbidden
guest
accepts
it
the
reader
in
whom
i
had
now
become
deeply
interested
no
longer
an
unwelcome
stranger
suspended
his
reading
laid
down
his
manuscript
and
looking
me
in
the
face
asked
are
you
a
believer
no
i
promptly
answered
what
part
of
the
narrative
do
you
question
all
of
it
have
you
not
already
investigated
some
of
the
statements
i
previously
made
he
queried
yes
i
said
but
you
had
not
then
given
utterance
to
such
preposterous
expressions
is
not
the
truth
the
truth
he
answered
you
ask
me
to
believe
impossibilities
i
replied
name
one
you
yourself
admit
i
said
warmly
that
you
were
incredulous
and
shook
your
head
when
your
guide
asserted
that
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
might
be
as
porous
as
a
sieve
and
still
hold
water
a
fountain
can
not
rise
above
its
source
it
often
does
however
he
replied
i
do
not
believe
you
i
said
boldly
and
furthermore
i
assert
that
you
might
as
reasonably
ask
me
to
believe
that
i
can
see
my
own
brain
as
to
accept
your
fiction
regarding
the
production
of
light
miles
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
i
can
make
your
brain
visible
to
you
and
if
you
dare
to
accompany
me
i
will
carry
you
beneath
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
prove
my
other
statement
he
said
come
he
arose
and
grasped
my
arm
i
hesitated
you
confess
that
you
fear
the
journey
i
made
no
reply
well
since
you
fear
that
method
i
am
ready
to
convince
you
of
the
facts
by
any
rational
course
you
may
select
and
if
you
wish
to
stake
your
entire
argument
on
the
general
statement
that
a
stream
of
water
can
not
rise
above
its
head
i
will
accept
the
challenge
but
i
insist
that
you
do
not
divulge
the
nature
of
the
experiment
until
as
you
are
directed
you
make
public
my
story
of
course
a
fluid
can
be
pumped
up
i
sarcastically
observed
however
i
promise
the
secrecy
you
ask
i
am
speaking
seriously
he
said
and
i
have
accepted
your
challenge
your
own
eyes
shall
view
the
facts
your
own
hands
prepare
the
conditions
necessary
procure
a
few
pints
of
sand
and
a
few
pounds
of
salt
evening
i
will
be
ready
to
make
the
experiment
agreed
if
you
will
induce
a
stream
of
water
to
run
up
hill
a
fountain
to
rise
above
its
head
i
will
believe
any
statement
you
may
henceforth
make
be
ready
then
he
replied
and
procure
the
materials
named
so
saying
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
abruptly
departed
these
substances
i
purchased
the
next
day
procuring
the
silver
sand
from
gordon
pharmacy
corner
of
eighth
and
western
row
and
promptly
at
the
specified
time
we
met
in
my
room
he
came
provided
with
a
cylindrical
glass
jar
about
eighteen
inches
high
and
two
inches
in
diameter
such
as
i
have
since
learned
is
called
a
hydrometer
jar
and
a
long
slender
drawn
glass
tube
the
internal
diameter
of
which
was
about
of
an
inch
you
have
deceived
me
i
said
i
know
well
enough
that
capillary
attraction
will
draw
a
liquid
above
its
surface
you
demonstrated
that
quite
recently
to
my
entire
satisfaction
true
and
yet
not
true
of
this
experiment
he
said
i
propose
to
force
water
through
and
out
of
this
tube
capillary
attraction
will
not
expel
a
liquid
from
a
tube
if
its
mouth
be
above
the
surface
of
the
supply
he
dipped
the
tip
of
a
capillary
tube
into
a
tumbler
of
water
the
water
rose
inside
the
tube
about
an
inch
above
the
surface
of
the
water
in
the
tumbler
capillary
attraction
can
do
no
more
he
said
break
the
tube
of
an
inch
above
the
water
far
below
the
present
capillary
surface
and
it
will
not
overflow
the
exit
of
the
tube
must
be
lower
than
the
surface
of
the
liquid
if
circulation
ensues
he
broke
off
a
fragment
and
the
result
was
as
predicted
then
he
poured
water
into
the
glass
jar
to
the
depth
of
about
six
inches
and
selecting
a
piece
of
very
thin
muslin
about
an
inch
square
turned
it
over
the
end
of
the
glass
tube
tied
it
in
position
and
dropped
that
end
of
the
tube
into
the
cylinder
the
muslin
simply
prevents
the
tube
from
filling
with
sand
he
explained
then
he
poured
sand
into
the
cylinder
until
it
reached
the
surface
of
the
water
see
figure
your
apparatus
is
simple
enough
i
remarked
i
am
afraid
with
some
sarcasm
nature
works
with
exceeding
simplicity
he
replied
there
is
no
complex
apparatus
in
her
laboratory
and
i
copy
after
nature
then
he
dissolved
the
salt
in
a
portion
of
water
that
he
drew
from
the
hydrant
into
my
wash
bowl
making
a
strong
brine
and
stirred
sand
into
the
brine
to
make
a
thick
mush
this
mixture
of
sand
and
brine
he
then
poured
into
the
cylinder
filling
it
nearly
to
the
top
see
figure
b
the
sand
settling
soon
left
a
layer
of
brine
above
it
as
shown
by
a
i
had
previously
noticed
that
the
upper
end
of
the
glass
tube
was
curved
and
my
surprise
can
be
imagined
when
i
saw
that
at
once
water
began
to
flow
through
the
tube
dropping
quite
rapidly
into
the
cylinder
the
lower
end
of
the
curve
of
the
glass
tube
was
fully
half
an
inch
above
the
surface
of
the
liquid
in
the
cylinder
i
here
present
a
figure
of
the
apparatus
figure
the
strange
man
or
man
image
i
do
not
know
which
sat
before
me
and
in
silence
we
watched
the
steady
flow
of
water
water
rising
above
its
surface
and
flowing
into
the
reservoir
from
which
it
was
being
continually
derived
do
you
give
up
he
asked
let
me
think
i
said
as
you
please
he
replied
how
long
will
this
continue
i
inquired
until
strong
salt
water
flows
from
the
tube
then
the
old
man
continued
i
would
suggest
that
after
i
depart
you
repeat
these
experiments
the
observations
of
those
interested
in
science
must
be
repeated
time
and
again
by
separate
individuals
it
is
not
sufficient
that
one
person
should
observe
a
phenomenon
repeated
experiments
are
necessary
in
order
to
overcome
error
of
manipulation
and
to
convince
others
of
their
correctness
not
only
yourself
but
many
others
after
this
manuscript
appears
should
go
through
with
similar
investigations
varied
in
detail
as
mind
expansion
may
suggest
this
experiment
is
but
the
germ
of
a
thought
which
will
be
enlarged
upon
by
many
minds
under
other
conditions
an
event
meteorological
may
occur
in
the
experience
of
one
observer
and
never
repeat
itself
this
is
possible
the
results
of
such
experiments
as
you
are
observing
however
must
be
followed
by
similar
results
in
the
hands
of
others
and
in
behalf
of
science
it
is
necessary
that
others
should
be
able
to
verify
your
experience
in
the
time
to
come
it
will
be
necessary
to
support
your
statements
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
your
perceptive
faculties
are
now
in
a
normal
condition
are
you
sure
that
your
conceptions
of
these
results
are
justified
by
normal
perception
may
you
not
be
in
an
exalted
state
of
mind
that
hinders
clear
perception
and
compels
you
to
imagine
and
accept
as
fact
that
which
does
not
exist
do
you
see
what
you
think
you
see
after
i
am
gone
and
the
influences
that
my
person
and
mind
exert
on
your
own
mind
have
been
removed
will
these
results
as
shown
by
my
experiments
follow
similar
experimental
conditions
in
the
years
that
are
to
pass
before
this
paper
is
to
be
made
public
it
will
be
your
duty
to
verify
your
present
sense
faculty
this
you
must
do
as
opportunities
present
and
with
different
devices
so
that
no
question
may
arise
as
to
what
will
follow
when
others
repeat
our
experiments
evening
i
will
call
again
but
remember
you
must
not
tell
others
of
this
experiment
nor
show
the
devices
to
them
illustration
fig
a
brine
b
sand
and
brine
mixed
c
sand
and
water
i
have
promised
i
answered
he
gathered
his
manuscript
and
departed
and
i
sat
in
meditation
watching
the
mysterious
fountain
as
he
had
predicted
finally
after
a
long
time
the
flow
slackened
and
by
morning
when
i
arose
from
my
bed
the
water
had
ceased
to
drip
and
then
i
found
it
salty
to
the
taste
the
next
evening
he
appeared
as
usual
and
prepared
to
resume
his
reading
making
no
mention
of
the
previous
test
of
my
faith
i
interrupted
him
however
by
saying
that
i
had
observed
that
the
sand
had
settled
in
the
cylinder
and
that
in
my
opinion
his
experiment
was
not
true
to
appearances
but
was
a
deception
since
the
sand
by
its
greater
weight
displaced
the
water
which
escaped
through
the
tube
where
there
was
least
resistance
ah
he
said
and
so
you
refuse
to
believe
your
own
eyesight
and
are
contriving
to
escape
the
deserved
penalty
i
will
however
acquiesce
in
your
outspoken
desire
for
further
light
and
repeat
the
experiment
without
using
sand
but
i
tell
you
that
mother
earth
in
the
phenomena
known
as
artesian
wells
uses
sand
and
clay
pools
of
mineral
waters
of
different
gravities
and
running
streams
the
waters
beneath
the
earth
are
under
pressure
induced
by
such
natural
causes
as
i
have
presented
you
in
miniature
the
chief
difference
being
that
the
supplies
of
both
salt
and
fresh
water
are
inexhaustible
and
by
natural
combinations
similar
to
what
you
have
seen
the
streams
within
the
earth
if
a
pipe
be
thrust
into
them
may
rise
continuously
eternally
from
a
reservoir
higher
than
the
head
in
addition
there
are
pressures
of
gases
and
solutions
of
many
salts
other
than
chloride
of
soda
that
tend
to
favor
the
phenomenon
you
are
unduly
incredulous
and
you
ask
of
me
more
than
your
right
after
staking
your
faith
on
an
experiment
of
your
own
selection
you
demand
more
of
me
even
than
nature
often
accomplishes
in
earth
structure
but
night
i
will
show
you
that
this
seemingly
impossible
feat
is
possible
he
then
abruptly
left
the
room
the
following
evening
he
presented
himself
with
a
couple
of
cans
one
of
them
without
a
bottom
i
thought
i
could
detect
some
impatience
of
manner
as
he
filled
the
perfect
can
d
with
water
from
the
hydrant
and
having
spread
a
strip
of
thin
muslin
over
the
mouth
of
the
other
can
b
pressed
it
firmly
over
the
mouth
c
of
the
can
of
water
which
it
fitted
tightly
thus
connecting
them
together
the
upper
bottomless
can
being
inverted
then
he
made
a
narrow
slit
in
the
center
of
the
muslin
with
his
and
through
it
thrust
a
glass
tube
like
that
of
our
former
experiment
next
he
wrapped
a
string
around
the
open
top
of
the
upper
can
crossed
it
over
the
top
and
tied
the
glass
tube
to
the
center
of
the
cross
string
simply
to
hold
this
tube
in
position
he
explained
the
remainder
of
the
bag
of
salt
left
from
the
experiment
of
the
preceding
evening
was
then
dissolved
in
water
and
the
brine
poured
into
the
upper
can
filling
it
to
the
top
then
carefully
thrusting
the
glass
tube
downward
he
brought
the
tip
of
the
curve
to
within
about
inch
of
the
surface
of
the
brine
when
immediately
a
rapid
flow
of
liquid
exhibited
itself

it

he
observed
i
can
not
deny
the
fact
i
replied
and
furthermore
i
am
determined
that
i
shall
not
question
any
subsequent
statement
that
you
may
make
we
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
and
the
water
ran
continuously
through
the
tube
i
was
becoming
alarmed
afraid
of
my
occult
guest
who
accepted
my
challenges
and
worked
out
his
results
so
rapidly
he
seemed
to
be
more
than
human
i
am
a
mortal
but
a
resident
of
a
higher
plane
than
you
he
replied
divining
my
thoughts
is
not
this
experiment
a
natural
one
yes
i
said
did
not
shakspeare
write
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
horatio
than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
yes
i
said
and
my
guest
continued
he
might
have
added
always
will
be
scientific
men
will
explain
this
phenomenon
i
suggested
yes
when
they
observe
the
facts
he
replied
it
is
very
simple
they
can
now
tell
as
i
have
before
remarked
how
columbus
stood
the
egg
on
end
however
given
the
problem
before
columbus
expounded
it
they
would
probably
have
wandered
as
far
from
the
true
solution
as
the
mountain
with
its
edgewise
layers
of
stone
is
from
the
disconnected
artesian
wells
on
a
distant
sea
coast
where
the
underground
fresh
and
salt
water
in
overlying
currents
and
layers
clash
together
the
explanation
of
course
is
simple
the
brine
is
of
greater
specific
gravity
than
the
pure
water
the
pressure
of
the
heavier
fluid
forces
the
lighter
up
in
the
tube
this
action
continues
until
as
you
will
see
by
this
experiment
in
the
gradual
diffusion
of
brine
and
pure
water
the
salt
is
disseminated
equally
throughout
the
vessels
and
the
specific
gravity
of
the
mixed
liquid
becomes
the
same
throughout
when
the
flow
will
cease
however
in
the
earth
where
supplies
are
inexhaustible
the
fountain
flows
unceasingly

the
science

the

a
story
as
an
object
lesson
the
reader
is
invited
to
skip
this
chapter
of
j
but
you
have
not
lived
up
to
the
promise
you
have
evaded
part
of
the
bargain
i
continued
while
you
have
certainly
performed
some
curious
experiments
in
physics
which
seem
to
be
unique
yet
i
am
only
an
amateur
in
science
and
your
hydrostatic
illustrations
may
be
repetitions
of
investigations
already
recorded
that
have
escaped
the
attention
of
the
scientific
gentlemen
to
whom
i
have
hitherto
applied
man
mind
is
a
creature
of
doubts
and
questions
he
observed
answer
one
query
and
others
rise
his
inner
self
is
never
satisfied
and
you
are
not
to
blame
for
wishing
for
a
sign
as
all
conditions
of
your
former
existence
compel
now
that
i
have
brushed
aside
the
more
prominent
questionings
you
insist
upon
those
omitted
and
appeal
to
me
to
he
hesitated
to
what
i
asked
curious
to
see
if
he
had
intuitively
grasped
my
unspoken
sentence
to
exhibit
to
you
your
own
brain
he
replied
that
is
it
exactly
i
said
you
promised
it
and
you
shall
be
held
strictly
to
your
bargain
you
agreed
to
show
me
my
own
brain
and
it
seems
evident
that
you
have
purposely
evaded
the
promise
that
i
have
made
the
promise
and
deferred
its
completion
can
not
be
denied
but
not
by
reason
of
an
inability
to
fulfill
the
contract
i
will
admit
that
i
purposely
deferred
the
exhibition
hoping
on
your
own
account
that
you
would
forget
the
hasty
promise
you
would
better
release
me
from
the
promise
you
do
not
know
what
you
ask
i
believe
that
i
ask
more
than
you
can
perform
i
answered
and
that
you
know
it
let
me
give
you
a
history
he
said
and
then
perhaps
you
will
relent
listen
a
man
once
became
involved
in
the
study
of
anatomy
it
led
him
to
destruction
he
commenced
the
study
in
order
to
learn
a
profession
he
hoped
to
become
a
physician
materia
medica
pharmacy
chemistry
enticed
him
at
first
but
after
a
time
presented
no
charms
he
was
a
dull
student
in
much
that
men
usually
consider
essential
to
the
practice
of
medicine
he
was
not
fitted
to
be
a
physician
gradually
he
became
absorbed
in
two
branches
physiology
and
anatomy
within
his
mental
self
a
latent
something
developed
that
neither
himself
nor
his
friends
had
suspected
this
was
an
increasing
desire
for
knowledge
concerning
the
human
body
the
insatiable
craving
for
anatomy
grew
upon
him
and
as
it
did
so
other
sections
of
medicine
were
neglected
gradually
he
lost
sight
of
his
professional
object
he
dropped
chemistry
materia
medica
pharmacy
and
at
last
morbidly
lived
only
in
the
aforenamed
two
branches
his
first
visit
to
the
dissecting
room
was
disagreeable
the
odor
of
putrid
flesh
the
sight
of
the
mutilated
bodies
repulsed
him
when
first
his
hand
warm
in
life
touched
the
clammy
flesh
of
a
corpse
he
shuddered
then
when
his
fingers
came
in
contact
with
the
viscera
of
a
cadaver
that
of
a
little
child
he
cried
out
in
horror
the
demonstrator
of
anatomy
urged
him
on
he
finally
was
induced
to
dissect
part
of
the
infant
the
reflex
action
on
his
sensitive
mind
first
stunned
and
then
warped
his
senses
his
companions
had
to
lead
him
from
the
room
it
off
wash
it
off
he
repeated
trying
to
throw
his
hand
from
his
person
horrible
unclean
the
child
is
yet
before
me
he
insisted
then
he
went
into
a
fever
and
raved
mother
will
meet
me
on
the
street
and
curse
me
he
cried
hand
is
red
with
the
blood
of
my
darling
it
has
desecrated
the
innocent
dead
and
mutilated
that
which
is
most
precious
to
a
mother
take
the
hand
away
wash
it
he
shouted
mother
curses
me
she
demands
retribution
better
that
a
man
be
dead
than
cursed
by
a
mother
whose
child
has
been
desecrated
so
the
unfortunate
being
raved
dreaming
all
manner
of
horrid
imaginings
but
at
last
he
recovered
a
different
man
he
returned
voluntarily
to
the
and
wrapped
himself
in
the
uncouth
work
nothing
in
connection
with
was
now
offensive
or
unclean
he
threw
aside
his
other
studies
he
became
a
slave
possessed
of
one
idea
he
scarcely
took
time
to
dine
respectably
indeed
he
often
ate
his
lunch
in
the
the
blood
of
a
child
was
again
and
again
on
his
fingers
it
mattered
not
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
wash
it
off
liver
of
man
is
not
more
sacred
than
the
liver
of
a
hog
he
argued
flesh
of
a
man
is
the
same
as
other
forms
of
animal
food
when
a
person
dies
the
vital
heat
escapes
consciousness
is
dissipated
and
the
cold
rigid
remains
are
only
animal
consciousness
and
life
are
all
that
is
of
man
one
is
force
the
other
matter
when
man
dies
both
perish
and
are
dissipated
his
friends
perceived
his
fondness
for
dissection
and
argued
with
him
again
endeavoring
now
to
overcome
his
infatuation
he
repelled
them
learned
in
my
vision
he
said
referring
to
his
fever
pope
was
right
in
saying
that
the
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man
i
care
nothing
for
your
priestly
superstitions
concerning
the
dead
these
fables
are
the
invention
of
designing
churchmen
who
live
on
the
superstitions
of
the
ignorant
i
am
an
infidel
and
believe
in
no
spirit
intangible
that
which
can
be
seen
felt
and
weighed
is
all
else
is
not
life
is
simply
a
sensation
all
beyond
is
chimerical
less
than
fantastic
believed
in
only
by
dupes
and
credulous
tools
of
knaves
or
creatures
of
blind
superstition
he
carried
the
finely
articulated
bleached
skull
of
a
cadaver
to
his
room
and
placed
it
beside
a
marble
statue
that
was
a
valued
heirloom
the
model
of
venus
of
milo
are
lime
compounds
he
cynically
observed
is
better
than
the
other
his
friends
protested
superstitious
education
is
at
fault
he
answered
mentally
clothe
one
of
these
objects
in
a
quality
it
does
not
deserve
and
the
thought
creates
a
pleasant
emotion
the
other
equally
as
pure
reminds
you
of
the
grave
that
you
fear
and
you
shudder
these
mental
pulsations
are
artificial
both
being
either
survivals
of
superstition
or
creations
of
your
own
mind
the
lime
in
the
skull
is
now
as
inanimate
as
that
of
the
statue
neither
object
is
responsible
for
its
form
neither
is
unclean
to
me
the
delicate
configuration
the
exact
articulation
the
perfect
adaptation
for
the
office
it
originally
filled
makes
each
bone
of
this
skull
a
thing
of
beauty
an
object
of
admiration
as
a
whole
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
think
of
this
wonderful
exquisitely
arranged
piece
of
mechanism
the
statue
you
admire
is
in
every
respect
outrivaled
by
the
skull
and
i
have
placed
the
two
together
because
it
pleases
me
to
demonstrate
that
man
most
artistic
creation
is
far
inferior
to
material
man
throw
aside
your
sentimental
prejudices
and
join
with
me
in
the
admiration
of
this
thing
of
beauty
and
he
toyed
with
the
skull
as
if
it
were
a
work
of
art
so
he
argued
and
arguing
passed
from
bone
to
bone
and
from
organ
to
organ
he
filled
his
room
with
abnormal
fragments
of
the
human
body
and
surrounded
himself
with
jars
of
preserved
anatomical
specimens
his
friends
fled
in
disgust
and
he
smiled
glad
to
be
alone
with
his
ghastly
subjects
he
was
infatuated
in
one
of
the
alcoves
of
science
the
old
man
paused
shall
i
proceed
he
asked
yes
i
said
but
involuntarily
moved
my
chair
back
for
i
began
again
to
be
afraid
of
the
speaker
at
last
this
scientific
man
had
mastered
all
that
was
known
concerning
physiology
and
anatomy
he
learned
by
heart
the
wording
of
great
volumes
devoted
to
these
subjects
the
human
frame
became
to
him
as
an
open
book
he
knew
the
articulation
of
every
muscle
could
name
a
bone
from
a
mere
fragment
the
microscope
ceased
to
be
an
object
of
interest
the
secrets
of
pathology
and
physiology
had
been
mastered
then
unconsciously
he
was
infected
by
another
tendency
a
new
thought
was
destined
to
dominate
his
brain
is
it
that
animates
this
frame
what
lies
inside
to
give
it
life
he
became
enthused
again
dead
body
to
which
i
have
given
my
time
is
not
the
conscious
part
of
man
he
said
to
himself
must
find
this
thing
of
life
within
i
have
been
only
a
butcher
of
the
dead
my
knowledge
is
superficial
again
the
old
man
hesitated
and
looked
at
me
inquiringly
shall
i
proceed
he
repeated
i
was
possessed
by
horror
but
yet
fascinated
and
answered
determinedly
go
on
beware
he
added
beware
of
the
science
of
life
pleadingly
he
looked
at
me
go
on
i
commanded
he
continued
with
the
cunning
of
a
madman
this
person
of
profound
learning
led
from
the
innocence
of
ignorance
to
the
heartlessness
of
advanced
biological
science
secretly
planned
to
seek
the
vital
forces
must
begin
with
a
child
for
the
life
essence
shows
its
first
manifestations
in
children
he
reasoned
he
moved
to
an
unfrequented
locality
discharged
his
servants
and
notified
his
former
friends
that
visitors
were
unwelcome
he
had
determined
that
no
interruption
to
his
work
should
occur
this
course
was
unnecessary
however
for
now
he
had
neither
friends
nor
visitors
he
employed
carpenters
and
artisans
and
perfected
a
series
of
mechanical
tables
beautiful
examples
of
automatic
mechanism
from
the
inner
room
of
that
house
no
cry
could
be
heard
by
persons
outside
it
will
be
seen
by
referring
to
the
epilogue
that
drury
agreed
to
mutilate
part
of
the
book
this
i
have
gladly
done
excising
the
passages
that
follow
to
use
the
words
of
venable
they
do
not
comport
with
the
general
delicacy
of
the

i
cried
aghast
i
have
had
enough
of
this
you
trifle
with
me
demon
i
have
not
asked
for
nightmare
stories
accounts
of
maniacal
investigators
who
madly
pursue
their
revolting
calling
and
discredit
the
name
of
science
you
asked
to
see
your
own

he
replied
and
have
been
given
a
terrible
story
instead
i
retorted
so
men
perverted
misconstruing
the
aim
of
science
answer
the
cry
of
humanity
he
said
one
by
one
the
cherished
treasures
of

have
been
stolen
from
the
faithful
what
to
the
mother
can
replace
the
babe
that
has
been
lost

next

i
answered
offers
a
comfort
bah
he
said
does
not
another
searcher
in
that
same
science
field
tell
the
mother
that
there
is
no
personal

that
she
will
never
see
her
babe
again
one
man
of

offering

this

science
that
seems
to
be
doing
so
much
for
humanity
will
continue
to
elevate
material
civilization
until
as
the
yeast
ferment
is
smothered
in
its
own

so
will
create
conditions
to
blot
itself
from
existence
and
destroy
the
civilization
it
creates
science
is
heartless
notwithstanding
the
personal
purity
of
the
majority
of
her
helpless
votaries
she
is
a
thief
not
of
ordinary
riches
but
of
treasures
that
can
not

replied
that
i
will
ever
be
led
to
disturb
the
creeds
of
the
faithful
and
i
will
not
be
diverted
i
demand
to
see
my
brain
your
demand
shall
now
be
fulfilled
you
have
been
warned
of
the
return
that
may
follow
the
commencement
of
this
study
you
force
the
issue
my
responsibility
ceases
no
man
of
science
realized
the
end
when
he
began
to
investigate
his
throbbing
brain
and
the
end
of
the
fabric
that
science
is
weaving
for
man
rests
in
the
hidden
future
the
story
i
have
related
is
a
true
one
as
thousands
of
faithful
men
who
unconsciously
have
been
led
into
infidelity
have
experienced
and
as
the
faithful
followers
of
sacred
teachings
can
also
perceive
who
recognize
that
their
religion
and
the
hope
of
heaven
is
slipping
away
beneath
the
steady
inroad
of
the
heartless
materialistic
investigator
who
clothes
himself
in
the
garb
of
science
rising
abruptly
from
his
chair
he
grasped
my
hand
you
shall
see

chapter

looking
the
living
brain
the
old
man
accompanied
his
word
come
as
i
have
said
by
rising
from
his
chair
and
then
with
a
display
of
strength
quite
out
of
proportion
to
his
age
he
grasped
my
wrist
and
drew
me
toward
the
door
realizing
at
once
that
he
intended
i
should
accompany
him
into
the
night
i
protested
saying
that
i
was
quite
unprepared
my
hat
at
least
i
insisted
as
he
made
no
recognition
of
my
first
demur
your
hat
is
on
your
head
he
replied
this
was
true
although
i
am
sure
the
hat
had
been
previously
hung
on
a
rack
in
a
distant
part
of
the
room
and
i
am
equally
certain
that
neither
my
companion
nor
myself
had
touched
it
leaving
me
no
time
for
reflection
he
opened
the
door
and
drew
me
through
the
and
into
the
gloom
as
though
perfectly
familiar
with
the
city
he
guided
me
from
my
cozy
home
on
the
retired
side
street
in
which
i
resided
eastwardly
into
the
busy
thoroughfare
western
row
our
course
led
us
down
towards
the
river
past
ninth
eighth
seventh
streets
now
and
then
a
pedestrian
stopped
to
gaze
in
surprise
at
the
unique
spectacle
the
old
man
leading
the
young
one
but
none
made
any
attempt
to
molest
us
we
passed
on
in
silence
out
of
the
busy
part
of
the
thoroughfare
and
into
the
shady
part
of
the
city
into
the
darkness
below
fifth
street
here
the
residences
were
poorer
and
and
factories
began
to
appear
we
were
now
in
a
quarter
of
the
city
into
which
strangers
seldom
if
ever
penetrated
after
night
and
in
which
i
would
not
have
cared
to
be
found
unprotected
at
any
time
after
sunset
much
less
in
such
questionable
company
i
protested
against
the
indiscretion
my
leader
made
no
reply
but
drew
me
on
past
the
flickering
gas
lights
that
now
and
then
appeared
at
the
intersection
of
third
pearl
second
and
water
streets
until
at
last
we
stood
in
darkness
on
the
bank
of
the
ohio
river
strange
the
at
that
time
of
night
only
made
a
trip
every
thirty
minutes
and
yet
it
was
at
the
landing
as
though
by
appointment
fear
began
to
possess
me
and
as
my
thoughts
recur
to
that
evening
i
can
not
understand
how
it
was
that
i
allowed
myself
to
be
drawn
without
cry
or
resistance
from
my
secure
home
to
the
ohio
river
in
such
companionship
i
can
account
for
the
adventure
only
by
the
fact
that
i
had
deliberately
challenged
my
companion
to
make
the
test
he
was
fulfilling
and
that
an
innate
consciousness
of
pride
and
justice
compelled
me
to
permit
him
to
employ
his
own
methods
we
crossed
the
river
without
speaking
and
rapidly
ascending
the
levee
we
took
our
course
up
main
street
into
covington
still
in
the
lead
my
aged
guide
without
hesitation
went
onward
to
the
intersection
of
main
and
pike
streets
thence
he
turned
to
the
right
and
following
the
latter
thoroughfare
we
passed
the
old
tannery
that
i
recalled
as
a
familiar
landmark
and
then
started
up
the
hill
onward
we
strode
past
a
hotel
named
niemeyer
and
soon
were
in
the
open
country
on
the
lexington
pike
treading
through
the
mud
diagonally
up
the
hill
back
of
covington
then
at
a
sharp
curve
in
the
road
where
it
rounded
the
point
of
the
hill
we
left
the
highway
and
struck
down
the
hillside
into
a
ravine
that
bounded
the
lower
side
of
the
avenue
we
had
long
since
left
the
city
lamps
and
sidewalks
behind
us
and
now
when
we
left
the
roadway
were
on
the
muddy
pike
at
a
considerable
elevation
upon
the
hillside
and
looking
backward
i
beheld
innumerable
lights
throughout
the
cities
of
cincinnati
covington
and
the
village
of
newport
sparkling
away
in
the
distance
behind
and
below
us
come
my
companion
said
again
as
i
hesitated
repeating
the
only
word
he
had
uttered
since
telling
his
horrible
story
come
down
the
hill
into
the
valley
we
plunged
and
at
last
he
opened
the
door
of
an
isolated
log
cabin
which
we
entered
he
lighted
a
candle
that
he
drew
from
his
pocket
and
together
we
stood
facing
each
other
be
seated
he
said
dryly
and
then
i
observed
that
the
cold
excuse
for
furniture
in
that
desolate
room
consisted
of
a
single
rude
chair
with
bottom
however
i
did
not
need
a
second
invitation
but
sank
exhausted
and
disconsolate
upon
the
welcome
object
my
companion
lost
no
time
but
struck
at
once
into
the
subject
that
concerned
us
arguing
as
follows
one
of
the
troubles
with
humanity
is
that
of
changing
a
thought
from
the
old
to
a
new
channel
to
grasp
at
one
effort
an
entirely
new
idea
is
an
impossibility
men
follow
men
in
trains
of
thought
expression
as
in
bodily
form
generations
of
men
follow
generations
a
child
born
with
three
legs
is
a
freak
of
nature
a
monstrosity
yet
it
sometimes
appears
a
man
possessed
of
a
new
idea
is
an
anomaly
a
something
that
may
not
be
impossible
but
which
has
never
appeared
it
is
almost
as
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
new
idea
as
it
is
to
create
out
of
nothing
a
new
material
or
an
element
neither
thoughts
nor
things
can
be
invented
both
must
be
evolved
out
of
a
preëxisting
something
which
it
necessarily
resembles
every
advanced
idea
that
appears
in
the
brain
of
man
is
the
result
of
a
suggestion
from
without
men
have
gone
on
and
on
ceaselessly
with
their
minds
bent
in
one
direction
ever
looking
outwardly
never
inwardly
it
has
not
occurred
to
them
to
question
at
all
in
the
direction
of
backward
sight
mind
has
been
enabled
to
read
the
impressions
that
are
made
in
and
on
the
substance
of
brain
convolutions
but
at
the
same
time
has
been
and
is
insensible
to
the
existence
of
the
convolutions
themselves
it
is
as
though
we
could
read
the
letters
of
the
manuscript
that
bears
them
without
having
conceived
of
a
necessity
for
the
existence
of
a
printed
surface
such
as
paper
or
anything
outside
the
letters
had
anatomists
never
dissected
a
brain
the
human
family
would
live
in
absolute
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
the
substance
that
lies
within
the
skull
did
you
ever
stop
to
think
that
the
mind
can
not
now
bring
to
the
senses
the
configuration
or
nature
of
the
substance
in
which
mind
exists
its
own
house
is
unknown
this
is
in
consequence
of
the
fact
that
physical
existence
has
always
depended
upon
the
study
of
external
surroundings
and
consequently
the
power
of
internal
sight
lies
undeveloped
it
has
never
been
deemed
necessary
for
man
to
attempt
to
view
the
internal
construction
of
his
body
and
hence
the
sense
of
feeling
only
advises
him
of
that
which
lies
within
his
own
self
this
sense
is
abstract
not
descriptive
normal
organs
have
no
sensible
existence
thus
an
abnormal
condition
of
an
organ
creates
the
sensation
of
pain
or
pleasure
but
discloses
nothing
concerning
the
appearance
or
construction
of
the
organ
affected
the
perfect
liver
is
as
vacancy
the
normal
brain
never
throbs
and
aches
the
quiescent
arm
presents
no
evidence
to
the
mind
concerning
its
shape
size
or
color
man
can
not
count
his
fingers
unless
some
outside
object
touches
them
or
they
press
successively
against
each
other
or
he
perceives
them
by
sight
the
brain
of
man
the
seat
of
knowledge
in
which
mind
centers
is
not
perceptible
through
the
senses
does
it
not
seem
irrational
however
to
believe
that
mind
itself
is
not
aware
or
could
not
be
made
cognizant
of
the
nature
of
its
material
surroundings
i
must
confess
that
i
have
not
given
the
subject
a
thought
i
replied
as
i
predicted
he
said
it
is
a
step
toward
a
new
idea
and
simple
as
it
seems
now
that
the
subject
has
been
suggested
you
must
agree
that
thousands
of
intelligent
men
have
not
been
able
to
formulate
the
thought
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
them
even
after
our
previous
conversation
concerning
the
possibility
of
showing
you
your
own
brain
you
were
powerless
and
could
not
conceive
of
the
train
of
thought
which
i
started
and
along
which
i
shall
now
further
direct
your
senses
the
eye
is
so
constituted
that
light
produces
an
impression
on
a
nervous
film
in
the
rear
of
that
organ
this
film
is
named
the
retina
the
impression
being
carried
backward
therefrom
through
a
magma
of
nerve
fibers
the
optic
nerve
and
reaching
the
brain
is
recorded
on
that
organ
and
thus
affects
the
mind
is
it
not
rational
to
suppose
it
possible
for
this
sequence
to
be
reversed
in
other
words
if
the
order
were
reversed
could
not
the
same
set
of
nerves
carry
an
impression
from
behind
to
the
retina
and
picture
thereon
an
image
of
the
object
which
lies
anterior
thereto
to
be
again
by
reflex
action
carried
back
to
the
brain
thus
bringing
the
brain
substance
itself
to
the
view
of
the
mind
and
thus
impress
the
senses
to
recapitulate
if
the
nerve
sensation
or
force
expression
should
travel
from
the
brain
to
the
retina
instead
of
from
an
outward
object
it
will
on
the
reverse
of
the
retina
produce
the
image
of
that
which
lies
behind
and
then
if
the
optic
nerve
carry
the
image
back
to
the
brain
the
mind
will
bring
to
the
senses
the
appearance
of
the
image
depicted
thereon
illustration
facing
the
open
window
he
turned
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
upward
this
is
my
first
consideration
of
the
subject
i
replied
exactly
he
said
you
have
passed
through
life
looking
at
outside
objects
and
have
been
heedlessly
ignorant
of
your
own
brain
you
have
never
made
an
exclamation
of
surprise
at
the
statement
that
you
really
see
a
star
that
exists
in
the
depths
of
space
millions
of
miles
beyond
our
solar
system
and
yet
you
became
incredulous
and
scornful
when
it
was
suggested
that
i
could
show
you
how
you
could
see
the
configuration
of
your
brain
an
object
with
which
the
organ
of
sight
is
nearly
in
contact
how
inconsistent
the
chain
of
reasoning
is
certainly
novel
and
yet
i
can
not
think
of
a
mode
by
which
i
can
reverse
my
method
of
sight
and
look
backward
i
now
respectfully
answered
it
is
very
simple
all
that
is
required
is
a
counter
excitation
of
the
nerve
and
we
have
with
us
what
any
person
who
cares
to
consider
the
subject
can
employ
at
any
time
and
thus
behold
an
outline
of
a
part
of
his
own
brain
i
will
give
you
the
lesson
placing
himself
before
the
sashless
window
of
the
cabin
which
opening
appeared
as
a
black
space
pictured
against
the
night
the
sage
took
the
candle
in
his
right
hand
holding
it
so
that
the
flame
was
just
below
the
tip
of
the
nose
and
about
six
inches
from
his
face
then
facing
the
open
window
he
turned
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
upward
seeming
to
fix
his
gaze
on
the
upper
part
of
the
open
window
space
and
then
he
slowly
moved
the
candle
transversely
backward
and
forward
across
in
front
of
his
face
keeping
it
in
such
position
that
the
flickering
flame
made
a
parallel
line
with
his
eyes
and
as
just
remarked
about
six
inches
from
his
face
and
just
below
the
tip
of
his
nose
speaking
deliberately
he
said
now
were
i
you
this
movement
would
produce
a
counter
irritation
of
the
retina
a
rhythm
of
the
optic
nerve
would
follow
a
reflex
action
of
the
brain
accompanying
and
now
a
figure
of
part
of
the
brain
that
rests
against
the
skull
in
the
back
of
my
head
would
be
pictured
on
the
retina
i
would
see
it
plainly
apparently
pictured
or
thrown
across
the
open
space
before
me
incredible
i
replied
try
for
yourself
quietly
said
my
guide
placing
myself
in
the
position
designated
i
repeated
the
maneuver
when
slowly
a
shadowy
something
seemed
to
be
evolved
out
of
the
blank
space
before
me
it
seemed
to
be
as
a
gray
veil
or
like
a
corrugated
sheet
as
thin
as
gauze
which
as
i
gazed
upon
it
and
discovered
its
outline
became
more
apparent
and
real
soon
the
convolutions
assumed
a
more
decided
form
the
gray
matter
was
visible
filled
with
venations
first
gray
and
then
red
and
as
i
became
familiar
with
the
sight
suddenly
the
convolutions
of
a
brain
in
all
its
exactness
with
a
network
of
red
blood
venations
burst
into
existence
this
experiment
is
not
claimed
as
original

my

as
an
uncanny
sensation
possessed
me
i
shudderingly
stopped
the
motion
of
the
candle
and
in
an
instant
the
shadowy
figure
disappeared

i
won
the
wager
yes
i
answered
then
said
my
companion
make
no
further
investigations
in
this
direction
but
i
wish
to
verify
the
experiment
i
replied
although
it
is
not
a
pleasant
test
i
can
not
withstand
the
temptation
to
repeat
it
and
again
i
moved
the
candle
backward
and
forward
when
the
figure
of
my
brain
sprung
at
once
into
existence
it
is
more
vivid
i
said
i
see
it
plainer
and
more
quickly
than
before
beware
of
the
science
of
man
i
repeat
he
replied
now
before
you
are
deep
in
the
toils
and
can
not
foresee
the
end
beware
of
the
science
of
human
biology
remember
the
story
recently
related
that
of
the
physician
who
was
led
to
destruction
by
the
alluring
voice
i
made
no
reply
but
stood
with
my
face
fixed
slowly
moving
the
candle
backward
and
forward
gazing
intently
into
the
depths
of
my
own
brain
after
a
time
the
old
man
removed
the
candle
from
my
hand
and
said
do
you
accept
the
fact
have
i
demonstrated
the
truth
of
the
assertion
yes
i
replied
but
tell
me
further
now
that
you
have
excited
my
interest
have
i
seen
and
learned
all
that
man
can
discover
in
this
direction
no
you
have
seen
but
a
small
portion
of
the
brain
convolutions
only
those
that
lie
directly
back
of
the
optic
nerve
by
systematic
research
under
proper
conditions
every
part
of
the
living
brain
may
become
as
plainly
pictured
as
that
which
you
have
seen
and
is
that
all
that
could
be
learned
i
asked
no
he
continued
further
development
may
enable
men
to
picture
the
figures
engraved
on
the
convolutions
and
at
last
to
read
the
thoughts
that
are
engraved
within
the
brains
of
others
and
thus
through
material
investigation
the
observer
will
perceive
the
recorded
thought
of
another
person
an
instrument
capable
of
searching
and
illuminating
the
retina
could
be
easily
affixed
to
the
eye
of
a
criminal
after
which
if
the
mind
of
the
person
operated
upon
were
stimulated
by
the
suggestion
of
an
occurrence
either
remote
or
recent
the
mind
facility
would
excite
the
brain

the

and
spread
the
circumstances
as
a

the
observer
the
brain
would
tell
its
own
story
and
the
investigator
could
read
the
truth
as
recorded
in
the
brain
of
the
other
man
a
criminal
subjected
to
such
an
examination
could
not
tell
an
untruth
or
equivocate
his
very
brain
would
present
itself
to
the
observer
and
you
make
this
assertion
and
then
ask
me
to
go
no
further
into
the
subject
yes
decidedly
yes
tell
me
then
could
you
not
have
performed
this
experiment
in
my
room
or
in
the
dark
cellar
of
my
house
any
one
can
repeat
it
with
a
candle
in
any
room
not
otherwise
lighted
by
looking
at
a
blackboard
a
blank
wall
or
black
space
he
said
i
was
indignant
why
have
you
treated
me
so
inhumanly
was
there
a
necessity
for
this
journey
these
mysterious
movements
this
physical
exertion
look
at
the
mud
with
which
i
am
covered
and
consider
the
return
trip
which
yet
lies
before
me
and
which
must
prove
even
more
exhausting
ah
he
said
you
overdraw
the
lesson
has
been
easily
acquired
science
is
not
an
easy
road
to
travel
those
who
propose
to
profit
thereby
must
work
circuitously
soil
their
hands
and
person
meet
discouragements
and
must
expect
hardships
reverses
abuse
and
discomfort
do
not
complain
but
thank
me
for
giving
you
the
lesson
without
other
tribulations
that
might
have
accompanied
it
besides
there
was
another
object
in
my
journey
an
object
that
i
have
quietly
accomplished
and
which
you
may
never
know
come
we
must
return
he
extinguished
the
light
of
the
candle
and
we
departed
together
trudging
back
through
the
mud
and
the
night
we
must
acquiesce
in
the
explanation
given
for
this
seemingly
journey
and
yet
feel
that
it
was
unnecessarily
exacting
of
that
wearisome
return
trip
i
have
nothing
to
say
beyond
the
fact
that
before
reaching
home
my
companion
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
a
side
street
and
that
the
cathedral
chimes
were
playing
for
three
as
i
passed
the
corner
of
eighth
street
and
western
row
the
next
evening
my
visitor
appeared
as
usual
and
realizing
his
complete
victory
he
made
no
reference
to
the
occurrences
of
the
previous
night
in
his
usual
calm
and
deliberate
manner
he
produced
the
roll
of
manuscript
saying
benignantly
and
in
a
gentle
tone
do
you
recollect
where
i
left
off
reading
you
had
reached
that
point
in
your
narrative
i
answered
at
which
your
guide
had
replaced
the
boat
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
and
the
mysterious
being
resumed
his
reading
the
manuscript
continued
chapter
xxxi
a
lesson
on
primary
colors
are
capable
of
farther
subdivision
get
into
the
boat
said
my
eyeless
pilot
and
we
will
proceed
to
the
farther
edge
of
the
lake
over
the
barrier
of
which
at
great
intervals
of
time
the
surface
water
flows
and
induces
the
convulsion
known
as
mount
epomeo
we
accordingly
embarked
and
a
gentle
touch
of
the
lever
enabled
us
rapidly
to
skirt
the
shore
of
the
underground
sea
the
soft
bright
pleasant
continually
enveloped
us
and
the
absence
of
either
excessive
heat
or
cold
rendered
existence
delightful
the
weird
forms
taken
by
the
objects
that
successively
presented
themselves
on
the
shore
were
a
source
of
continual
delight
to
my
mind
the
motion
of
our
boat
was
constantly
at
the
will
of
my
guide
now
we
would
skim
across
a
great
bay
flashing
from
point
to
point
again
we
wound
slowly
through
tortuous
channels
and
among
partly
submerged
stones
what
a
blessing
this
mode
of
locomotion
would
be
to
humanity
i
murmured
humanity
will
yet
attain
it
he
replied
step
by
step
men
have
stumbled
along
towards
the
goal
that
the
light
of
coming
centuries
is
destined
to
illuminate
they
have
studied
and
are
still
engaged
in
studying
the
properties
of
grosser
forces
such
as
heat
and
electricity
and
they
will
be
led
by
the
thread
they
are
following
to
this
and
other
achievements
yet
unthought
of
but
which
lie
back
of
those
more
conspicuous
illustration
we
finally
reached
a
precipitous
bluff
we
finally
reached
a
precipitous
bluff
that
sprung
to
my
view
as
by
magic
and
which
with
a
surface
stretched
upward
to
a
height
beyond
the
scope
of
my
vision
rising
straight
from
the
surface
of
the
lake
it
was
composed
of
a
material
seemingly
black
as
jet
and
yet
when
seen
under
varying
spectacular
conditions
as
we
skirted
its
base
it
reflected
or
emitted
most
gorgeously
the
brilliant
hues
of
the
rainbow
and
also
other
colors
hitherto
unknown
to
me
there
is
something
unique
in
these
shades
species
of
color
appear
that
i
can
not
identify
i
seem
to
perceive
colors
utterly
unlike
any
that
i
know
as
the
result
of
deflected
or
transmitted
sunlight
rays
and
they
look
unlike
the
combinations
of
primary
colors
with
which
i
am
familiar
your
observations
are
true
some
of
these
colors
are
unknown
on
earth
but
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
we
have
all
possible
combinations
of
the
seven
prismatic
rays
i
answered
how
can
there
be
others
here
because
first
your
primary
colors
are
capable
of
further
subdivision
second
other
rays
invisible
to
men
under
usual
conditions
also
emanate
from
the
sun
and
under
favorable
circumstances
may
be
brought
to
the
sense
of
sight
do
you
assert
that
the
prism
is
capable
of
only
partly
analyzing
the
sunlight
yes
what
reason
have
you
to
argue
that
because
a
triangular
bit
of
glass
resolves
a
white
ray
into
seven
fractions
that
are
as
men
say
differently
colored
you
could
not
by
proper
methods
subdivide
each
of
these
primary
shades
into
others
what
reason
have
you
to
doubt
that
rays
now
invisible
to
man
accompany
those
capable
of
impressing
his
senses
and
might
by
proper
methods
become
perceptible
as
new
colors
none
i
answered
only
that
i
have
no
proof
that
such
rays
exist
but
they
do
exist
and
men
will
yet
learn
that
the
term
ray
as
applied
to
each
of
the
seven
colors
of
the
rainbow
is
incorrect
each
will
yet
be
resolved
and
as
our
faculties
multiply
and
become
more
subtle
other
colors
will
be
developed
possessed
of
a
delicacy
and
richness
indescribable
now
for
as
yet
man
can
not
comprehend
the
possibilities
of
education
beyond
the
limits
of
his
present
condition
during
this
period
of
conversation
we
skirted
the
richly
colored
bluff
with
a
rapid
motion
and
at
last
shot
beyond
it
as
with
a
flash
into
seeming
vacancy
i
was
sitting
with
my
gaze
directed
toward
the
bluff
and
when
it
instantly
disappeared
i
rubbed
my
eyes
to
convince
myself
of
their
truthfulness
and
as
i
did
so
our
boat
came
gradually
to
a
stand
on
the
edge
of
what
appeared
to
be
an
unfathomable
abyss
beneath
me
on
the
side
where
had
risen
the
bluff
that
disappeared
so
abruptly
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
was
an
absolute
void
to
our
right
and
before
and
behind
us
stretched
the
surface
of
that
great
smooth
lake
on
whose
bosom
we
rested
to
our
left
our
boat
brushing
its
rim
a
narrow
ledge
a
continuation
of
the
black
material
reached
only
a
foot
above
the
water
and
beyond
this
narrow
brink
the
mass
descended
perpendicularly
to
seemingly
infinite
depths
involuntarily
i
grasped
the
sides
of
the
boat
and
recoiled
from
the
frightful
chasm
over
which
i
had
been
so
suddenly
suspended
and
which
exceeded
anything
of
a
similar
description
that
i
had
ever
seen
the
immeasurable
depth
of
the
abyss
in
connection
with
the
apparently
frail
barrier
that
held
the
great
lake
in
its
bounds
caused
me
to
shudder
and
shrink
back
and
my
brain
reeled
in
dizzy
fright
an
inexplicable
attraction
however
notwithstanding
my
dread
held
me
and
although
i
struggled
to
shut
out
that
view
the
endeavor
failed
i
seemed
to
be
drawn
by
an
irresistible
power
and
yet
i
shuddered
at
the
awful
majesty
of
that
yawning
gulf
which
threatened
to
end
the
world
on
which
i
then
existed
fascinated
entranced
i
could
not
help
gazing
i
knew
not
how
long
down
down
into
that
fathomless
silent
profundity
composing
myself
i
turned
a
questioning
glance
on
my
guide
he
informed
me
that
this
hard
dam
confined
the
waters
of
the
slowly
rising
lake
that
we
were
sailing
over
and
which
finally
would
rise
high
enough
to
overflow
the
barrier
illustration
the
wall
descended
perpendicularly
to
seemingly
infinite
depths
the
cycle
of
the
periodic
overflow
is
measured
by
great
intervals
he
said
centuries
are
required
to
raise
the
level
of
the
lake
a
fraction
of
an
inch
and
thousands
of
years
may
elapse
before
its
surface
will
again
reach
the
top
of
the
adamantine
wall
then
governed
by
the
law
that
attracts
a
liquid
to
itself
and
heaps
the
teaspoon
with
liquid
the
water
of
the
quiet
lake
piles
upon
this
narrow
wall
forming
a
ledge
along
its
summit
finally
the
superimposed
surface
water
gives
way
and
a
skim
of
water
pours
over
into
the
abyss
he
paused
i
leaned
over
and
meditated
for
i
had
now
accustomed
myself
to
the
situation
there
is
no
bottom
i
exclaimed
upon
the
contrary
he
answered
the
bottom
is
less
than
ten
miles
beneath
us
and
is
a
great
orifice
the
neck
of
the
funnel
reaching
first
down
and
then
upward
from
us
diagonally
toward
the
surface
of
the
earth
although
the
light
by
which
we
are
enveloped
is
bright
yet
it
is
deficient
in
penetrating
power
and
is
not
capable
of
giving
the
contour
of
objects
even
five
miles
away
hence
the
chasm
seems
bottomless
and
the
gulf
measureless
is
it
not
natural
to
suppose
that
a
mass
of
water
like
this
great
lake
would
overflow
the
barrier
immediately
as
soon
as
the
surface
reached
the
upper
edge
for
the
pressure
of
the
immense
volume
must
be
beyond
calculation
no
for
it
is
height
not
expanse
which
as
hydrostatic
engineers
understand
governs
the
pressure
of
water
a
liquid
column
one
foot
in
width
would
press
against
the
retaining
dam
with
the
force
of
a
body
of
the
same
liquid
the
same
depth
one
thousand
miles
in
extent
then
the
decrease
of
gravity
here
permits
the
molecular
attraction
of
the
molecules
to
exert
itself
more
forcibly
than
would
be
the
case
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
this
holds
the
liquid
mass
together
more
firmly
see
he
observed
and
dipping
his
finger
into
the
water
he
held
it
before
him
with
a
drop
of
water
attached
thereto
figure
the
globule
being
of
considerable
size
and
lengthened
as
though
it
consisted
of
some
glutinous
liquid
illustration
fig
how
can
a
thin
stratum
of
water
give
rise
to
a
volcanic
eruption
i
next
queried
there
seems
to
be
no
melted
rock
no
evidence
of
intense
heat
either
beneath
or
about
us
i
informed
you
some
time
ago
that
i
would
partially
explain
these
facts
know
then
that
the
theories
of
man
concerning
volcanic
eruptions
in
connection
with
a
molten
interior
of
the
earth
are
such
as
are
evolved
in
ignorance
of
even
the
of
the
globe
the
earth
interior
is
to
mankind
a
sealed
chamber
and
the
wise
men
who
elucidate
the
curious
theories
concerning
natural
phenomena
occurring
therein
are
forced
to
draw
entirely
upon
their
imagination
few
persons
realize
the
paucity
of
data
at
the
command
of
workers
in
science
theories
concerning
the
earth
are
formulated
from
so
little
real
knowledge
of
that
body
that
our
science
may
be
said
to
be
all
theory
with
scarcely
a
trace
of
actual
evidence
to
support
it
if
a
globe
ten
inches
in
diameter
be
covered
with
a
sheet
of
paper
such
as
i
hold
in
my
hand
the
thickness
of
that
sheet
will
be
greater
in
proportion
to
that
of
such
a
globe
than
the
depth
men
have
explored
within
the
earth
is
compared
with
the
thickness
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
the
outer
surface
of
a
pencil
line
represents
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
inner
surface
of
the
line
represents
the
depth
of
man
explorations
the
highest
mountain
would
be
represented
by
a
comma
resting
on
the
line
the
geologist
studies
the
substances
that
are
thrust
from
the
crater
of
an
active
volcano
and
from
this
makes
conjectures
regarding
the
strata
beneath
and
the
force
that
casts
the
excretions
out
the
results
must
with
men
therefore
furnish
evidence
from
which
to
explain
the
cause
it
is
as
though
an
anatomist
would
form
his
idea
of
the
anatomy
of
the
liver
by
the
secretion
thrown
out
of
that
organ
or
of
the
lung
texture
by
the
breath
and
sputum
in
fact
volcanoes
are
of
several
descriptions
and
usually
are
extremely
superficial
this
lake
the
surface
of
which
is
but
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
underground
is
the
mother
of
an
exceptionally
deep
one
when
the
water
pours
over
this
ledge
it
strikes
an
element
below
us
the
metallic
base
of
salt
which
lies
in
great
masses
in
some
portions
of
the
earth
crust
then
an
immediate
chemical
reaction
ensues
the
water
is
dissociated
intense
heat
results
part
of
the
water
combines
with
the
metal
part
is
vaporized
as
steam
while
part
escapes
as
an
inflammable
gas
the
sudden
liberation
of
these
gases
causes
an
irregular
pressure
of
vapor
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
the
result
being
a
throbbing
and
rebounding
of
the
attenuated
atmosphere
above
which
in
gigantic
waves
like
swelling
tides
dashes
great
volumes
of
water
over
the
ledge
beside
us
and
into
the
depth
below
this
water
in
turn
reacts
on
fresh
portions
of
the
metallic
base
and
the
reflex
action
increases
the
vapor
discharges
and
as
a
consequence
the
chamber
we
are
in
becomes
a
gasholder
containing
vapors
of
unequal
gas
pressures
and
the
resultant
agitation
of
the
lake
from
the
turmoil
continues
and
the
pulsations
are
repeated
until
the
surface
of
the
lake
is
lowered
to
such
a
degree
as
at
last
to
prevent
the
water
from
overflowing
the
barrier
finally
the
lake
quiets
itself
the
gases
slowly
disappear
by
earth
absorption
and
by
escape
from
the
volcanic
exit
and
for
an
unrecorded
period
of
time
thereafter
the
surface
of
the
lake
continues
to
rise
slowly
as
it
is
doing
now
this
view
is
supported
in
theory
by
a
note
i
believe
to
have
somewhere
seen
recorded
elsewhere
other
bases
are
mentioned
j
but
what
has
this
phenomenon
to
do
with
the
volcano
it
produces
the
eruption
the
water
that
rushes
down
into
the
chasm
partly
as
steam
partly
as
gas
is
forced
onward
and
upward
through
a
crevice
that
leads
to
the
old
crater
of
the
presumed
extinct
but
periodically
active
mount
epomeo
these
gases
are
intensely
heated
and
they
move
with
fearful
velocity
they
tear
off
great
masses
of
stone
which
the
resultant
energy
disturbances
pressure
gas
and
friction
redden
with
heat
the
mixture
of
gases
from
the
decomposed
water
is
in
large
amount
is
burning
and
exploding
and
in
this
fiery
furnace
amid
such
convulsions
as
have
been
described
the
adjacent
earth
substance
is
fused
and
even
clay
is
melted
and
carried
on
with
the
fiery
blast
finally
the
current
reaches
the
earth
surface
through
the
funnel
passage
the
apex
of
which
is
a
volcano
the
blast
described
a
volcanic
eruption
one
thing
is
still
obscure
in
my
mind
i
said
you
assert
that
the
reaction
which
follows
the
contact
of
the
flowing
water
and
metallic
bases
in
the
crevice
below
us
liberates
the
explosive
gases
and
also
volumes
of
vapor
of
water
these
gases
rush
you
say
and
produce
a
volcanic
eruption
in
a
distant
part
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
i
can
not
understand
why
they
do
not
rush
backward
as
well
and
produce
another
eruption
in
kentucky
surely
the
pressure
of
a
gas
in
confinement
is
the
same
in
all
directions
is
it
not
yes
he
replied
but
the
conditions
in
the
different
directions
are
dissimilar
in
the
direction
of
the
kentucky
cavern
the
passage
is
tortuous
and
often
contracts
to
a
narrow
crevice
in
one
place
near
the
cavern
mouth
as
you
will
remember
we
had
to
dive
beneath
the
surface
of
a
stream
of
water
that
stratum
of
water
as
effectually
closed
the
exit
from
the
earth
as
the
stopper
prevents
water
escaping
from
a
bottle
between
the
point
we
now
occupy
and
that
water
stopper
rest
thousands
of
miles
of
quiescent
air
the
inertia
of
a
thousand
miles
of
air
is
great
beyond
your
comprehension
to
move
that
column
of
air
by
pushing
against
this
end
of
it
and
thus
shoving
it
instantly
out
of
the
other
end
would
require
greater
force
than
would
burst
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
inelastic
stone
above
us
then
the
friction
of
the
sides
is
another
thing
that
prevents
its
accomplishment
while
a
gradually
applied
pressure
would
in
time
overcome
both
the
inertia
of
the
air
and
the
friction
of
the
stone
passages
it
would
take
a
supply
of
energy
greater
than
you
can
imagine
to
start
into
motion
the
elastic
mass
that
stands
as
solid
and
immovable
as
a
sentinel
of
adamant
between
the
cavern
you
entered
and
the
spot
we
now
occupy
time
and
energy
combined
would
be
able
to
accomplish
the
result
but
not
under
present
conditions
in
the
other
direction
a
broad
open
channel
reaches
directly
to
and
connects
with
the
volcanic
shaft
through
this
channel
the
air
is
in
motion
moving
towards
the
extinct
crater
being
supplied
from
another
surface
orifice
the
gases
liberated
in
the
manner
i
have
described
naturally
follow
the
line
of
least
resistance
they
turn
at
once
away
from
the
inert
mass
of
air
that
rests
behind
us
and
move
with
increasing
velocity
towards
the
volcanic
exit
before
the
pressure
that
might
be
exerted
towards
the
kentucky
cavern
would
have
more
than
compressed
the
intervening
column
of
air
enough
to
raise
the
water
of
a
well
from
its
usual
level
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
velocity
in
the
other
direction
would
have
augmented
prodigiously
and
with
its
increased
rapidity
a
suction
would
follow
more
than
sufficient
to
consume
the
increasingly
abundant
gases
from
behind
volcanoes
are
therefore
local
and
the
interior
of
the
earth
is
not
a
molten
mass
as
i
have
been
taught
i
exclaimed
he
answered
if
men
were
far
enough
along
in
their
thought
journey
for
the
evolution
of
the
mental
side
of
man
is
a
journey
in
the
world
of
thought
they
would
avoid
such
theories
as
that
which
ascribes
a
molten
interior
to
the
earth
volcanoes
are
superficial
they
are
as
a
rule
when
in
activity
but
little
blisters
or
excoriations
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
although
their
underground
connections
may
be
extensive
some
of
them
are
in
a
continual
fret
with
frequent
eruptions
others
like
the
one
under
consideration
awaken
only
after
great
periods
of
time
the
entire
surface
of
this
globe
has
been
or
will
be
subject
to
volcanic
action
the
phenomenon
is
one
of
the
steps
in
the
process
when
the
deposit
of
substances
that
i
have
indicated
and
of
which
much
of
the
earth
interior
is
composed
the
bases
of
salt
potash
and
lime
and
clay
is
exhausted
there
will
be
no
further
volcanic
action
from
this
cause
and
in
some
places
this
deposit
has
already
disappeared
or
is
covered
deeply
by
layers
of
earth
that
serve
as
a
protection
is
water
then
the
universal
cause
of
volcanoes
water
and
air
together
cause
most
of
them
the
action
of
water
and
its
vapor
produces
from
metallic
space
dust
limestone
and
clay
soil
potash
and
soda
salts
this
perfectly
rational
and
natural
action
must
continue
as
long
as
there
is
water
above
and
free
elementary
bases
in
contact
with
the
earth
bubbles
volcanoes
earthquakes
geysers
mud
springs
and
hot
springs
are
the
natural
result
of
that
reaction
mountains
are
thereby
forming
by
upheavals
from
beneath
and
the
corresponding
surface
valleys
are
consequently
filling
up
either
by
the
slow
deposit
of
the
matter
from
the
saline
water
of
hot
springs
or
by
the
sudden
eruption
of
a
new
or
presumably
extinct
volcano
what
would
happen
if
a
crevice
in
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
should
conduct
the
waters
of
the
ocean
into
a
deposit
of
metallic
bases
that
often
occurs
was
the
reply
a
volcanic
wave
results
and
a
volcano
may
thus
rise
from
the
ocean
depths
is
there
any
danger
to
the
earth
itself
may
it
not
be
riven
into
fragments
from
such
a
convulsion
i
hesitatingly
questioned
no
while
the
configuration
of
continents
is
continually
being
altered
each
disturbance
must
be
practically
superficial
and
of
limited
area
but
i
persisted
the
rigid
solid
earth
may
be
blown
to
fragments
in
such
convulsions
a
result
like
that
seems
not
impossible
you
argue
from
an
erroneous
hypothesis
the
earth
is
neither
rigid
nor
solid
true
i
answered
if
it
were
solid
i
could
not
be
a
hundred
miles
beneath
its
surface
in
conversation
with
another
being
but
there
can
not
be
many
such
cavities
as
that
which
we
are
now
traversing
and
they
can
not
surely
extend
entirely
through
its
mass
the
great
weight
of
the
superincumbent
material
would
crush
together
the
strongest
materials
if
a
globe
as
large
as
our
earth
were
extensively
honeycombed
in
this
manner
quite
the
contrary
he
replied
and
here
let
me
for
the
first
time
enlighten
you
as
to
the
interior
structure
of
the
terrestrial
globe
the
principle
consists
of
an
invisible
sphere
of
energy
that
spinning
through
space
supports
the
space
dust
which
collects
on
it
as
dust
on
a
bubble
by
gradual
accumulation
of
substance
on
that
sphere
a
hollow
ball
has
resulted
on
the
outer
surface
of
which
you
have
hitherto
dwelt
the
crust
of
the
earth
is
comparatively
thin
not
more
than
eight
hundred
miles
in
average
thickness
and
is
held
in
position
by
the
central
sphere
of
energy
that
now
exists
at
a
distance
about
seven
hundred
miles
beneath
the
ocean
level
the
force
inherent
to
this
sphere
manifests
itself
upon
the
matter
which
it
supports
on
both
sides
rendering
matter
the
lighter
the
nearer
it
lies
to
the
center
sphere
in
other
words
let
me
say
to
you
the
crust
or
shell
which
i
have
just
described
as
being
but
about
eight
hundred
miles
in
thickness
is
firm
and
solid
on
both
its
convex
and
concave
surface
but
gradually
loses
in
weight
whether
we
penetrate
from
the
outer
surface
toward
the
center
or
from
any
point
of
the
inner
surface
towards
the
outside
until
at
the
central
sphere
matter
has
no
weight
at
all
do
you
conceive
my
meaning
yes
i
replied
i
understand
you
perfectly
after
a
pause
my
pilot
asked
me
abruptly
what
do
you
most
desire
the
question
caused
my
mind
to
revert
instantly
to
my
old
home
on
the
earth
above
me
and
although
i
felt
the
hope
of
returning
to
it
spring
up
in
my
heart
the
force
of
habit
caused
me
involuntarily
to
answer
more
light
more
light
being
your
desire
you
shall
receive
it
obedient
to
his
touch
the
bow
of
the
boat
turned
from
the
gulf
we
had
been
considering
towards
the
center
of
the
lake
the
responsive
craft
leaped
forward
and
in
an
instant
the
obsidian
parapet
disappeared
behind
us
on
and
over
the
trackless
waste
of
water
we
sped
until
the
dead
silence
became
painfully
oppressive
and
i
asked
whither
are
we
bound
towards
the
east
the
answer
raised
my
spirits
i
thought
again
that
in
this
man
despite
his
repulsive
shape
i
beheld
a
friend
a
brother
suspicion
vanished
and
my
courage
rose
he
touched
the
lever
and
the
craft
subject
to
his
will
nearly
rose
from
the
water
and
sped
with
amazing
velocity
as
was
evident
from
the
appearance
of
the
luminous
road
behind
us
so
rapid
was
our
flight
that
the
wake
of
the
boat
seemed
as
if
made
of
rigid
parallel
lines
that
disappeared
in
the
distance
too
quick
for
the
eye
to
catch
the
tremor
continuing
his
conversation
my
companion
informed
me
that
he
had
now
directed
the
bark
toward
a
point
east
of
the
spot
where
we
struck
the
shore
after
crossing
the
lake
in
order
that
we
might
continue
our
journey
downward
diagonally
to
the
under
surface
of
the
earth
crust
this
recent
digression
from
our
journey
proper
said
he
has
been
made
to
acquaint
you
with
a
subject
regarding
which
you
have
exhibited
a
curiosity
and
about
which
you
have
heretofore
been
misinformed
now
you
understand
more
clearly
part
of
the
philosophy
of
volcanoes
and
earthquakes
you
have
yet
much
to
learn
in
connection
with
allied
phenomena
but
this
study
of
the
crude
exhibition
of
matter
the
manipulation
of
which
is
familiar
to
man
under
the
above
names
is
an
introduction
to
the
more
wonderful
study
destined
yet
to
be
a
part
of
your
field
an
investigation
of
quiescent
matter
and
pure
motion
i
can
not
comprehend
you
i
replied
as
i
stated
once
before
when
you
referred
to
what
you
designated
as
pure
motion
chapter
xxxii
matter
is
retarded
motion
it
is
possible
is
it
not
for
you
to
imagine
a
continuous
volley
of
iron
balls
passing
near
you
in
one
line
in
a
horizontal
direction
with
considerable
velocity
suppose
that
a
pane
of
glass
were
to
be
gradually
moved
so
that
a
corner
of
it
would
be
struck
by
one
of
the
balls
then
the
entire
sheet
of
glass
would
be
shivered
by
the
concussion
even
though
the
bullet
struck
but
a
single
spot
of
glass
the
point
of
contact
covering
only
a
small
area
imagine
now
that
the
velocity
of
the
volley
of
bullets
be
increased
a
thousand
fold
then
a
plate
of
glass
thrust
into
their
track
would
be
smoothly
cut
as
though
with
a
file
that
would
gnaw
its
way
without
producing
a
single
radiating
fracture
a
person
standing
near
the
volley
would
now
hear
a
deep
purr
or
growling
sound
caused
by
the
friction
between
the
bullets
and
the
air
increase
gradually
the
rapidity
of
their
motion
and
this
growl
would
become
more
acute
passing
from
a
deep
low
murmur
into
one
less
grave
and
as
the
velocity
increased
the
tone
would
become
sharper
and
at
last
piercingly
shrill
increase
now
the
rapidity
of
the
train
of
bullets
again
and
again
the
notes
would
decrease
in
turn
passing
back
again
successively
through
the
several
keys
that
had
preceded
and
finally
would
reach
the
low
growl
which
first
struck
the
ear
and
with
a
further
increase
of
speed
silence
would
ensue
silence
evermore
regardless
of
increasing
velocity
from
these
hundreds
of
miles
in
a
second
at
which
the
volley
is
now
passing
let
the
rapidity
be
augmented
a
thousand
times
reaching
in
their
flight
into
millions
of
miles
each
second
and
to
the
eye
from
the
point
where
the
sound
disappeared
as
the
velocity
increased
a
dim
redness
would
appear
a
glow
just
perceptible
indicating
to
the
sense
of
sight
by
a
continuous
line
the
track
of
the
moving
missiles
to
all
appearance
the
line
would
be
as
uniform
as
an
illuminated
pencil
mark
even
though
the
several
integral
bullets
of
the
trail
might
be
separated
one
from
another
by
miles
of
space
let
a
pane
of
glass
now
be
thrust
across
their
track
and
from
the
point
of
contact
a
shower
of
sparks
would
fly
and
the
edges
of
glass
close
to
either
side
of
the
orifice
would
be
shown
on
withdrawing
the
glass
to
have
been
fused
conceive
now
that
the
velocity
of
the
bullets
be
doubled
and
trebled
again
and
again
the
line
of
red
light
becomes
brighter
then
brilliant
and
finally
as
the
velocity
increases
at
a
certain
point
pure
white
results
and
to
sense
the
trail
would
now
be
a
continuous
something
as
solid
as
a
bar
of
metal
if
at
a
white
heat
and
even
if
the
bullets
were
a
thousand
miles
apart
man
could
not
bring
proof
of
their
separate
existence
to
his
senses
that
portion
of
a
pane
of
glass
or
other
substance
even
steel
or
adamant
which
should
cross
its
track
now
would
simply
melt
away
the
portion
excised
and
carried
out
of
that
pathway
neither
showing
itself
as
scintillations
nor
as
fragments
of
matter
the
solid
would
instantly
liquefy
and
would
spread
itself
as
a
thin
film
over
the
surface
of
each
ball
of
that
white
hot
mass
of
fleeing
metal
now
to
all
essential
conditions
as
uniform
as
a
bar
of
iron
madly
increase
the
velocity
to
millions
upon
millions
of
miles
per
second
and
the
heat
will
disappear
gradually
as
did
the
sound
while
the
bright
light
will
pass
backward
successively
through
the
primary
shades
of
color
that
are
now
known
to
man
beginning
with
violet
and
ending
with
red
and
as
the
red
fades
away
the
train
of
bullets
will
disappear
to
the
sense
of
man
neither
light
nor
sound
now
accompanies
the
volley
neither
the
human
eye
nor
the
human
ear
can
perceive
its
presence
drop
a
pane
of
glass
or
any
other
object
edgewise
through
it
and
it
gives
to
the
sense
of
man
no
evidence
the
molecules
of
the
glass
separate
from
in
front
to
close
in
from
behind
and
the
moving
train
passes
through
it
as
freely
as
light
leaving
the
surface
of
the
glass
unaffected
a
scientific
critic
seems
to
think
that
the
shrill
cry
would
cease
instantly
and
not
gradually
however
science
has
been
at
fault
more
than
once
and
i
do
not
care
to
take
liberties
with
this
j
hold
i
interrupted
that
would
be
as
one
quality
of
matter
passing
through
another
quality
of
matter
without
disturbance
to
either
and
it
is
a
law
in
physics
that
two
substances
can
not
occupy
the
same
space
at
the
same
time
that
law
holds
good
as
man
understands
the
subject
but
bullets
are
no
longer
matter
motion
of
mass
was
first
changed
into
motion
of
molecules
and
motion
of
molecule
became
finally
augmented
into
motion
of
free
force
entities
as
the
bullets
disintegrated
into
molecular
corpuscles
and
then
were
dissociated
atoms
resulting
at
this
last
point
the
sense
of
vision
and
of
touch
ceased
to
be
affected
by
that
moving
column
neither
matter
nor
force
and
at
the
next
jump
in
velocity
the
atoms
themselves
disappeared
and
free
intangible
motion
resulted
nothing
vacancy
this
result
is
the
spirit
of
space
the
ether
of
mankind
as
solid
as
adamant
and
as
mobile
as
vacuity
if
you
can
reverse
the
order
of
this
phenomenon
and
imagine
an
irregular
retardation
of
the
rapidity
of
such
atomic
motion
you
can
read
the
story
of
the
formation
of
the
material
universe
follow
the
chain
backward
and
with
the
decrease
of
velocity
motion
becomes
tangible
matter
again
and
in
accordance
with
conditions
governing
the
change
of
motion
into
matter
from
time
to
time
the
various
elements
successively
appear
the
planets
may
grow
without
and
within
and
ethereal
space
can
generate
elemental
dirt
if
you
can
conceive
of
an
intermediate
condition
whereby
pure
space
motion
becomes
partly
tangible
and
yet
is
not
gross
enough
to
be
earthy
matter
you
can
imagine
how
such
forces
as
man
is
acquainted
with
light
heat
electricity
magnetism
or
gravity
even
are
produced
for
these
are
also
disturbances
in
space
motion
it
should
be
easily
understood
that
according
to
the
same
simple
principle
other
elements
and
unknown
forces
as
well
now
imperceptible
to
man
limited
faculties
could
be
and
are
formed
outside
and
inside
his
field
of
perception
i
fear
that
i
can
not
comprehend
all
this
i
answered
so
i
feared
and
perhaps
i
have
given
you
this
lesson
too
soon
although
some
time
ago
you
asked
me
to
teach
you
concerning
the
assertion
that
electricity
light
heat
magnetism
and
gravity
are
disturbances
and
you
said
of
what
think
the
lesson
over
and
you
will
perceive
that
it
is
easy
let
us
hope
that
the
time
will
come
when
we
will
be
able
to
glance
beneath
the
rough
material
earth
surface
knowledge
that
man
has
acquired
and
experience
the
mind
expansion
that
leads
to
the
blissful
insight
possessed
by
superior
beings
who
do
not
have
to
contend
with
the
rasping
elements
that
encompass
all
who
dwell
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
i
pondered
over
these
words
and
a
vague
light
an
undefined
inexpressible
something
that
i
could
not
put
into
words
broke
into
my
mind
i
inferred
that
we
were
destined
to
meet
with
persons
or
existences
possessed
of
new
senses
of
a
mind
development
that
man
had
not
reached
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
questioning
my
pilot
when
the
motion
of
the
boat
was
suspended
land
appeared
ahead
we
drew
up
to
it
and
disembarked
lifting
the
boat
from
the
water
my
guide
placed
it
on
land
at
the
edge
of
the
motionless
lake
and
we
resumed
our
journey
the
scenery
seemed
but
little
changed
from
that
of
the
latter
part
of
our
previous
line
of
travel
down
the
inclined
plane
of
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
that
we
had
crossed
the
direction
was
still
downward
after
leaving
the
high
ridge
that
bordered
the
edge
of
the
lake
the
floor
of
the
cavern
being
usually
smooth
although
occasionally
it
was
rough
and
covered
with
stony
debris
the
mysterious
light
grew
perceptibly
brighter
as
we
progressed
the
halo
previously
mentioned
became
less
dense
and
the
ring
of
obscurity
widened
rapidly
i
could
distinctly
perceive
objects
at
a
great
distance
i
turned
to
my
companion
to
ask
why
this
was
and
he
replied
because
we
are
leaving
one
of
the
undiscovered
conditions
of
the
upper
atmosphere
that
disturbs
the
sunlight
do
you
say
that
the
atmosphere
is
composed
of
substances
unknown
to
man
yes
several
of
them
are
gases
and
others
are
qualities
of
space
condition
neither
gas
liquid
nor
solid
one
particularly
interferes
with
light
in
its
passage
it
is
an
entity
that
is
not
moved
by
the
motion
of
the
air
and
is
unequally
distributed
over
the
surface
as
we
ascend
above
the
earth
it
decreases
so
it
does
as
we
descend
into
it
it
is
not
vapor
of
water
is
neither
smoke
nor
a
true
gas
and
is
as
yet
sensible
to
man
only
by
its
power
of
modifying
the
intensity
of
light
it
has
no
color
is
chemically
inactive
and
yet
modifies
the
sun
rays
so
as
to
blot
objects
from
view
at
a
comparatively
small
distance
from
a
person
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
this
fact
is
known
to
man
is
evident
from
the
knowledge
he
possesses
of
the
difference
in
the
power
of
his
organs
of
vision
at
different
parts
of
the
earth
his
sight
is
especially
acute
on
the
table
lands
of
the
western
territories
this
has
since
been
partly
supported
by
the
discovery
of
the
element
argon
however
the
statement
has
been
recorded
many
years
miss
ella
burbige
stenographer
newport
copied
the

it
in

errett

meader
president
of
the
american
ticket
brokers
association
in
it
seems
proper
to
make
this
explanation
in
order
to
absolve
the
author
from
any
charge
of
plagiarism
for
each
of
these
persons
will
recall
distinctly
this
improbable
then
j
i
have
been
told
i
answered
that
vapor
of
water
causes
this
obscuration
or
absorption
of
light
vapor
of
water
unless
in
strata
of
different
densities
is
absolutely
transparent
and
presents
no
obstacle
to
the
passage
of
light
he
said
when
vapor
obstructs
light
it
is
owing
to
impurities
contained
in
it
to
currents
of
varying
densities
or
wave
motions
or
to
a
mechanical
mixture
of
condensed
water
and
air
whereby
multitudes
of
tiny
globular
water
surfaces
are
produced
pure
vapor
of
water
free
from
motion
is
passive
to
the
sunlight
i
can
scarcely
believe
that
a
substance
such
as
you
describe
or
that
any
constituent
of
the
air
can
have
escaped
the
perception
of
the
chemist
i
replied
in
as
i
thought
a
facetious
manner
he
repeated
after
me
the
word
chemist
and
continued
have
chemists
detected
the
ether
of
aristotle
that
you
have
mentioned
and
i
have
defined
which
scientists
nevertheless
accept
pervades
all
space
and
every
description
of
matter
and
that
i
have
told
you
is
really
matter
itself
changed
into
ultra
atomic
motion
have
chemists
explained
why
one
object
is
transparent
and
another
of
equal
weight
and
solidity
is
opaque
have
chemists
told
you
why
vermillion
is
red
and
indigo
is
blue
the
statement
that
they
respectively
reflect
these
rays
of
light
is
not
an
explanation
of
the
cause
for
such
action
have
chemists
told
you
why
the
prism
disarranges
or
distorts
sunlight
to
produce
the
abnormal
hues
that
men
assume
compose
elementary
rays
of
light
have
chemists
explained
anything
concerning
the
why
or
wherefore
of
the
attributes
of
matter
or
force
or
even
proven
that
the
primary
forms
of
matter
or
elements
are
not
compounds
upon
the
contrary
does
not
the
evolution
that
results
in
the
recorded
discoveries
of
the
chemist
foretell
or
at
least
indicate
the
possible
future
of
the
art
and
promise
that
surrounding
mysteries
are
yet
to
be
developed
and
expanded
into
open
truths
thus
elaborating
hidden
forces
and
that
other
forms
of
matter
and
unseen
force
expressions
are
destined
to
spring
into
existence
as
the
sciences
progress
the
chemist
of
is
groping
in
darkness
he
is
a
novice
as
compared
with
the
elaborated
chemist
of
the
near
future
the
imperfectly
seen
of
the
present
the
silent
and
unsuspected
will
become
distinctly

in
a
time
that
is
to
come

a
brightening
of
the
intellect
by
these
successively
upward
steps
up
stairs
of

will
if

serves
herself
best
broaden
the
mind
and
give
power
to

resulting
finally
in
he
hesitated
go
on
i
said
the
passage
of
mortal
man
with
the
faculties
of
man
intact
into
communion
with
the
spirit
world
chapter
xxxiii
a
study
of
science
is
a
study
of
god
communing
with
angels
this
is
incredible
i
exclaimed
you
need
not
be
astonished
he
answered
is
there
any
argument
that
can
be
offered
to
controvert
the
assertion
that
man
is
ignorant
of
many
natural
laws
i
can
offer
none
is
there
any
doubt
that
a
force
distinct
and
separate
from
matter
influences
matter
and
vivifies
it
into
a
living
personality
i
do
not
deny
that
there
is
such
force
what
then
should
prevent
this
force
from
existing
separate
from
the
body
if
it
be
capable
of
existing
in
it
i
can
not
argue
against
such
a
position
if
as
is
hoped
and
believed
by
the
majority
of
mankind
even
though
some
try
to
deny
the
fact
it
is
possible
for
man
to
exist
as
an
association
of
earth
matters
linked
to
a
personal
spirit
force
the
soul
and
for
the
spirit
force
after
the
death
of
the
body
to
exist
independent
of
the
grosser
attributes
of
man
free
from
his
mortal
body
is
it
not
reasonable
to
infer
that
the
spirit
while
it
is
still
in
man
and
linked
to
his
body
may
be
educated
and
developed
so
as
under
favorable
conditions
to
meet
and
communicate
with
other
spirits
that
have
been
previously
liberated
from
earthly
bondage
i
submit
i
answered
but
you
shock
my
sensibilities
when
you
thus
imply
that
by
cold
scientific
investigation
we
can
place
ourselves
in
a
position
to
meet
the
unseen
spirit
world
it
was
now
my
turn
to
hesitate
go
on
he
said
to
commune
with
the
angels
i
answered
a
study
of
true
science
is
a
study
of
god
he
continued
angels
are
organizations
natural
in
accordance
with
god
laws
they
appear
superhuman
because
of
our
ignorance
concerning
the
higher
natural
forces
they
exist
in
exact
accordance
with
the
laws
that
govern
the
universe
but
as
yet
the
attraction
between
clay
and
spirit
is
so
great
as
to
prevent
the
enthralled
soul
of
man
from
communicating
with
them
the
faith
of
the
religionist
is
an
example
of
the
unquenchable
feeling
that
creates
a
belief
as
well
as
a
hope
that
there
is
a
separate
from
earthy
substances
the
scoffing
scientific
agnostic
working
for
other
objects
will
yet
astonish
himself
by
elaborating
a
method
that
will
practically
demonstrate
these
facts
and
then

as
exemplified
by
the
unquestioning
faithful
believer

systematic

typified
in

chapter
xxxiv
i
cease
to
breathe
and
yet
live
during
this
conversation
we
had
been
rapidly
walking
or
i
should
better
say
advancing
for
we
no
longer
walked
as
men
do
but
skipped
down
into
the
earth
down
ever
downward
there
were
long
periods
of
silence
in
which
i
was
engaged
in
meditating
over
the
problems
that
successively
demanded
solution
and
even
had
i
desired
to
do
so
i
could
have
kept
no
record
of
time
days
or
even
weeks
may
have
been
consumed
in
this
journey
neither
have
i
any
method
of
judging
of
the
rapidity
of
our
motion
i
was
sensible
of
a
marked
decrease
in
the
amount
of
muscular
energy
required
to
carry
us
onward
and
i
realized
that
my
body
was
quite
exempt
from
weariness
motion
became
restful
instead
of
exhausting
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
ratio
of
the
loss
of
weight
as
shown
by
our
free
movements
in
proportion
to
the
distance
we
traversed
was
greater
than
formerly
the
slightest
exhibition
of
propelling
force
cast
us
rapidly
forward
instead
of
the
laborious
short
step
of
upper
earth
a
single
leap
would
carry
us
many
yards
a
slight
spring
and
with
our
bodies
in
space
we
would
skip
several
rods
alighting
gently
to
move
again
as
easily
i
marveled
for
although
i
had
been
led
to
anticipate
something
unusual
the
practical
evidence
was
wonderfully
impressive
and
i
again
questioned
my
guide
we
are
now
nearing
what
physicists
would
call
the
center
of
gravity
he
replied
and
our
weight
is
rapidly
diminishing
this
is
in
exact
accordance
with
the
laws
that
govern
the
force
called
gravitation
which
at
the
earth
surface
is
apparently
uniform
though
no
instrument
known
to
man
can
demonstrate
its
exact
variation
within
the
field
man
occupies
men
have
not
as
yet
been
in
a
position
to
estimate
this
change
although
it
is
known
that
mountains
attract
objects
and
that
a
change
in
weight
as
we
descend
into
the
earth
is
perceptible
but
to
evolve
the
true
law
observation
at
a
distance
of
at
least
ten
miles
beneath
the
surface
of
the
ocean
is
necessary
and
man
being
a
creature
whose
motions
are
confined
to
a
thin
horizontal
skin
of
earth
has
never
been
one
mile
beneath
its
surface
and
in
consequence
his
opportunities
for
comparison
are
extremely
limited
illustration
we
would
skip
several
rods
alighting
gently
i
have
been
taught
i
replied
that
the
force
of
gravitation
decreases
until
the
center
of
the
earth
is
reached
at
which
point
a
body
is
without
weight
and
i
can
scarcely
understand
how
such
positive
statements
from
scientific
men
can
be
far
from
the
truth
it
is
supposed
by
your
surface
men
that
the
maximum
of
weight
is
to
be
found
at
the
distance
beneath
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
therefrom
decreases
until
at
the
center
it
is
nothing
at
all
he
replied
this
hypothesis
though
a
stagger
toward
the
right
is
far
from
the
truth
but
as
near
as
could
be
expected
when
we
consider
the
data
upon
which
men
base
their
calculations
were
it
not
for
the
purpose
of
controverting
erroneous
views
men
would
have
little
incentive
to
continue
their
investigations
and
as
has
been
the
rule
in
science
heretofore
the
truth
will
in
time
appear
in
this
case
one
generation
of
students
disproves
the
accepted
theories
of
that
which
precedes
all
working
to
eliminate
error
all
adding
factors
of
error
and
all
together
moving
toward
a
common
goal
a
grand
generalization
that
as
yet
can
not
be
perceived
and
still
each
series
of
workers
is
overlooking
phenomena
that
though
obvious
are
yet
unperceived
but
which
will
make
evident
to
future
scientists
the
mistakes
of
the
present
as
an
example
of
the
manner
in
which
facts
are
thus
overlooked
in
your
journey
you
have
been
impressed
with
certain
surprising
external
conditions
or
surroundings
and
yet
are
oblivious
to
conditions
more
remarkable
in
your
own
body
so
it
is
with
scientists
they
overlook
prominent
facts
that
stare
them
boldly
in
the
face
facts
that
are
so
conspicuous
as
to
be
invisible
by
reason
of
their
very
nearness
this
statement
i
can
not
disprove
and
therefore
must
admit
under
protest
where
there
is
so
much
that
appears
mysterious
i
may
have
overlooked
some
things
but
i
can
scarcely
accept
that
in
ignorance
i
have
passed
conditions
in
my
own
organization
so
marked
as
this
decrease
in
gravity
which
has
so
strikingly
been
called
to
my
attention
you
have
and
to
convince
you
i
need
only
say
that
you
have
nearly
ceased
to
breathe
and
are
unconscious
of
the
fact
i
stopped
short
in
momentary
alarm
and
now
that
my
mind
was
directed
to
the
fact
i
became
aware
that
i
did
not
desire
to
breathe
and
that
my
chest
had
ceased
to
heave
with
the
alternate
inhalation
and
exhalation
of
former
times
i
closed
my
lips
firmly
and
for
a
long
period
there
was
no
desire
for
breath
then
a
slight
involuntary
inhalation
followed
and
an
exhalation
scarcely
noticeable
succeeded
by
a
great
interval
of
inaction
i
impulsively
turned
my
face
toward
the
passage
we
had
trod
a
feeling
of
alarm
possessed
me
an
uncontrollable
inexpressible
desire
to
flee
from
the
mysterious
beside
me
to
return
to
men
and
be
an
man
again
and
i
started
backward
through
the
chamber

had
passed

me
by
the
hand

cried
where

you
not

from
me
all
that

love
or
cherish
and
undone
every

of

have
you
not

me
into
paths
that
the
imagination
of
the
novelist
dare
not
conjure
and
into
experiences
that
pen
in

would
not
venture
to
describe
as
possible
until
i
now
stand
with
my
feet
on
the
boundary

vacancy

utter

lost

say
and
repeat
is
it

that

answered

a
certain
point
within
a
sphere
men
are
as
parasites
on
the
roof
of
earth
i
realized
again
as
i
had
so
many
times
before
that
it
was
useless
for
me
to
rebel
the
mystery
of
a
sacrificed
life
lies
before
me
i
murmured
and
there
is
no
chance
to
retrace
my
footsteps
the
of
the
course
that
i
have
voluntarily
selected
and
sworn
to
follow
is
hidden
i
must
nerve
myself
to
pursue
it
to
the
bitter
end
and
so
help
me
god
and
keep
me
steadfast
well
said
he
replied
and
since
you
have
so
wisely
determined
i
am
free
to
inform
you
that
these
new
obligations
like
those
you
have
heretofore
taken
contain
nothing
which
can
conflict
with
your
duty
to
god
your
country
your
neighbor
or
yourself
in
considering
the
phenomena
presented
by
the
suspension
of
the
act
of
breathing
it
should
occur
to
you
that
where
little
labor
is
to
be
performed
little
consumption
of
energy
is
required
where
there
is
such
a
trifling
destruction
of
the
vital
force
not
mind
force
as
at
present
is
the
case
with
us
it
requires
but
slight
respiration
to
retain
the
normal
condition
of
the
body
on
earth
surface
the
act
of
respiration
alone
consumes
by
far
the
larger
proportion
of
vital
energy
and
the
muscular
exertion
involved
thereby
necessitates
a
proportionate
amount
of
breathing
in
order
that
breath
itself
may
continue
this
act
of
respiration
is
the
result
of
one
of
the
conditions
of
surface
earth
life
and
consumes
most
of
the
vital
force
if
men
would
think
of
this
they
would
understand
how
paradoxical
it
is
for
them
to
breathe
in
order
to
live
when
the
very
act
of
respiration
wears
away
their
bodies
and
shortens
their
lives
more
than
all
else
they
have
to
do
and
without
adding
to
their
mental
or
physical
constitution
in
the
least
men
are
conversant
with
physical
death
as
a
constant
result
of
suspended
respiration
and
with
respiration
as
an
accompaniment
of
life
which
ever
constant
and
connected
conditions
lead
them
to
accept
that
the
act
of
breathing
is
a
necessity
of
mortal
life
in
reality
man
occupies
an
unfortunate
position
among
other
undeveloped
creatures
of
external
earth
he
is
an
animal
and
is
constitutionally
framed
like
the
other
animals
about
him
he
is
exposed
to
the
warring
elements
to
the
vicious
attacks
of
savage
beasts
and
insidious
parasites
and
to
the
inroads
of
disease
he
is
a
prey
to
the
elementary
vicissitudes
of
the
undesirable
exposure
in
which
he
exists
upon
the
outer
surface
of
our
globe
where
all
is
war
even
among
the
forces
of
nature
about
him
these
conditions
render
his
lot
an
unhappy
one
indeed
and
in
ignorance
he
overlooks
the
torments
of
the
weary
rasping
endless
slavery
of
respiration
in
the
personal
struggle
he
has
to
undergo
in
order
to
retain
a
brief
existence
as
an
organized
being
have
you
never
thought
of
the
connected
tribulations
that
the
wear
and
tear
of
respiration
alone
inflict
upon
the
human
family
the
heaving
of
the
chest
the
circulation
of
the
blood
the
throbbing
of
the
heart
continue
from
mortal
birth
until
death
the
heart
of
man
forces
about
two
and
ounces
of
blood
with
each
pulsation
at
seventy
beats
per
minute
this
amounts
to
six
hundred
and
pounds
per
hour
or
nearly
eight
tons
per
day
the
lungs
respire
over
one
thousand
times
an
hour
and
move
over
three
thousand
gallons
of
air
a
day
multiply
these
amounts
by
three
hundred
and
and
then
by
seventy
and
you
have
partly
computed
the
enormous
of
the
lungs
and
heart
of
an
adult
over
two
hundred
thousand
tons
of
blood
and
million
gallons
of
air
have
been
moved
by
the
vital
force
the
energy
thus
consumed
is
dissipated
no
return
is
made
for
the
expenditure
of
this
life
force
during
the
natural
life
of
man
more
energy
is
consequently
wasted
in
material
transformation
resulting
from
the
motion
of
heart
and
lungs
than
would
be
necessary
to
sustain
the
purely
vital
forces
alone
for
a
thousand
years
besides
the
act
of
respiration
which
man
is
compelled
to
perform
in
his
exposed
position
necessitates
the
consumption
of
large
amounts
of
food
in
order
to
preserve
the
animal
heat
and
replace
the
waste
of
a
material
body
that
in
turn
is
worn
out
by
these
very
movements
add
this
waste
of
energy
to
the
foregoing
and
then
you
will
surely
perceive
that
the
possible
life
of
man
is
also
curtailed
to
another
and
greater
degree
in
the
support
of
the
digestive
part
of
his
organism
his
spirit
is
a
slave
to
his
body
his
lungs
and
heart
on
which
he
imagines
life
depends
are
unceasing
antagonists
of
life
that
his
act
of
breathing
is
now
a
necessity
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
where
the
force
of
gravity
presses
so
heavily
and
where
the
elements
have
men
at
their
command
and
show
him
no
mercy
i
will
not
deny
but
it
is
exasperating
to
contemplate
such
a
waste
of
energy
and
corresponding
loss
of
human
life
you
must
admit
however
that
it
is
necessary
i
queried
no
only
to
an
extent
the
natural
life
of
man
should
and
yet
will
be
doubled
trebled
multiplied
a
dozen
yes
a
thousand
fold
i
stepped
in
front
of
him
we
stood
facing
each
other
tell
me
i
cried
how
men
can
so
improve
their
condition
as
to
lengthen
their
days
to
the
limit
you
name
and
let
me
return
to
surface
earth
a
carrier
of
the
glad
tidings
he
shook
his
head
i
dropped
on
my
knees
before
him
illustration
i
dropped
on
my
knees
before
him
i
implore
you
in
behalf
of
that
unfortunate
humanity
of
which
i
am
a
member
give
me
this
boon
i
promise
to
return
to
you
and
do
your
bidding
whatever
may
be
my
subsequent
fate
i
promise
to
acquiesce
therein
willingly
he
raised
me
to
my
feet
be
of
good
cheer
he
said
and
in
the
proper
time
you
may
return
to
the
surface
of
this
rind
of
earth
a
carrier
of
great
and
good
news
to
men
shall
i
teach
them
of
what
you
have
shown
me
i
asked
yes
in
part
you
will
be
a
forerunner
but
before
you
obtain
the
information
that
is
necessary
to
the
comfort
of
mankind
you
will
have
to
visit
surface
earth
again
and
return
again
perhaps
repeatedly
you
must
prove
yourself
as
men
are
seldom
proven
the
journey
you
have
commenced
is
far
from
its
conclusion
and
you
may
not
be
equal
to
its
subsequent
trials
prepare
yourself
therefore
for
a
series
of
events
that
may
unnerve
you
if
you
had
full
confidence
and
faith
in
your
guide
you
would
have
less
cause
to
fear
the
result
but
your
suspicious
human
nature
can
not
overcome
the
shrinking
sensation
that
is
natural
to
those
who
have
been
educated
as
you
have
been
amid
the
changing
vicissitudes
of
the
earth
surface
and
you
can
not
but
be
incredulous
by
reason
of
that
education
then
i
stopped
as
i
observed
before
me
a
peculiar
fungus
peculiar
because
unlike
all
others
i
had
seen
the
convex
part
of
its
bowl
was
below
and
the
great
head
as
an
inverted
toadstool
stood
upright
on
a
short
pedestal
the
gills
within
were
of
a
deep
green
color
and
curved
out
from
the
center
in
the
form
of
a
spiral
this
form
however
was
not
the
distinguishing
feature
for
i
had
before
observed
specimens
that
were
spiral
in
structure
the
extraordinary
peculiarity
was
that
the
gills
were
covered
with
fruit
this
fruit
was
likewise
green
in
color
each
spore
or
berry
being
from
two
to
three
inches
in
diameter
and
honeycombed
on
the
surface
corrugated
most
beautifully
i
stopped
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
great
bowl
and
plucked
a
specimen
of
the
fruit
it
seemed
to
be
covered
with
a
hard
transparent
shell
and
to
be
nearly
full
of
a
clear
green
liquid
i
handled
and
examined
it
in
curiosity
at
which
my
guide
seemed
not
to
be
surprised
regarding
me
attentively
he
said
what
is
it
that
impels
a
mortal
towards
this
fruit
it
is
curious
i
said
nothing
more
as
for
that
said
he
it
is
not
curious
at
all
the
seed
of
the
lobelia
of
upper
earth
is
more
curious
because
while
it
is
as
exquisitely
corrugated
it
is
also
microscopically
small
in
the
second
place
you
err
when
you
say
it
is
simply
curious
more
for
no
mortal
ever
yet
passed
that
bowl
without
doing
exactly
as
you
have
done
the
vein
of
curiosity
were
it
that
alone
that
impels
you
could
not
but
have
an
exception
then
he
cracked
the
shell
of
the
fruit
by
striking
it
on
the
stony
floor
and
carefully
opened
the
shell
handing
me
one
of
the
halves
filled
with
a
green
fluid
as
he
did
so
he
spoke
the
single
word
drink
and
i
did
as
directed
he
stood
upright
before
me
and
as
i
looked
him
in
the
face
he
seemingly
without
a
reason
struck
off
into
a
dissertation
apparently
as
distinct
from
our
line
of
thought
as
a
disconnected
subject
could
be
as
follows

tendency

the

that

would

here
i
replied
in
this
underground
land
where
food
is
free
and
existence
possible
without
an
effort
this
shameful
vice
has
no
existence
here
there
is
no
incentive
to
intemperance
and
even
though
man
were
present
with
his
inherent
passion
for
drink
he
could
not
find
means
to
gratify
his
appetite
ah
my
guide
replied
that
is
an
error
why
should
this
part
of
the
earth
prove
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
nature
always
supplies
the
means
and
man
instinct
teaches
him
how
to
prepare
an
intoxicant
so
long
as
man
is
human
his
passions
will
rule
if
you
should
prove
unequal
to
the
task
you
have
undertaken
if
you
shrink
from
your
journey
and
turn
back
the
chances
are
you
will
fail
to
reach
the
surface
of
the
earth
you
will
surely
stop
in
the
chamber
which
we
now
approach
and
which
i
have
now
prepared
you
to
enter
and
will
then
become
one
of
a
band
of
earth
drunkards
having
all
the
lower
passions
of
a
mortal
you
will
yet
be
lost
to
the
virtues
of
man
in
this
chamber
those
who
falter
and
turn
back
stop
and
remain
for
all
time
sinking
until
they
become
lower
in
the
human
scale
than
any
drunkard
on
earth
without
any
restraining
influence
without
a
care
without
necessity
of
food
or
incentive
to
exertion
in
this
habitation
where
heat
and
cold
are
unknown
and
no
motive
for
exists
they
turn
their
thoughts
toward
the
ruling
passion
of
mankind
and
listen
do
you
not
hear
them
listen
chapter

the
drunkard
voice
then
i
noticed
a
medley
of
sounds
seemingly
rising
out
of
the
depths
beyond
us
the
noise
was
not
such
as
to
lead
me
to
infer
that
persons
were
speaking
coherently
but
rather
resembled
a
jargon
such
as
might
come
from
a
multitude
of
persons
talking
indiscriminately
and
aimlessly
it
was
a
constant
volley
now
rising
and
now
falling
in
intensity
as
though
many
persons
regardless
of
one
another
were
chanting
different
tunes
in
that
peculiar
tone
often
characteristic
of
the
drunkard
as
we
advanced
the
noise
became
louder
and
more
of
a
medley
until
at
last
we
were
surrounded
by
confusion
then
a
single
voice
rose
up
strong
and
full
and
at
once
from
about
us
close
to
us
yes
against
our
very
persons
cries
and
shrieks
unearthly
smote
my
ears
i
could
distinguish
words
of
various
tongues
english
irish
german
and
many
unfamiliar
and
disjointed
cries
imprecations
and
maledictions
the
cavern
about
seemed
now
to
be
resonant
with
voices
shrieks
yells
and
maniacal
cries
commingled
and
yet
no
form
appeared
as
we
rushed
onward
for
now
my
guide
grasped
my
arm
tightly
and
drew
me
rapidly
down
the
cavern
floor
the
voices
subsided
and
at
length
sounded
as
if
behind
us
now
however
it
seemed
as
though
innumerable
arrows
each
possessed
of
a
whistle
or
tone
of
its
own
were
in
gusts
shrieking
by
us
coming
from
in
front
they
burst
in
the
rear
stopping
to
listen
i
found
that
a
connection
could
be
traced
between
the
screech
of
the
shriek
and
a
drunkard
distant
voice
it
seemed
as
though
a
rocket
made
of
an
escaping
voice
would
scream
past
and
bursting
in
the
cavern
behind
liberate
a
human
cry
now
and
then
all
but
a
few
would
subside
to
burst
out
with
increased
violence
as
if
a
flight
of
rockets
each
with
a
cry
of
its
own
would
rush
past
to
be
followed
after
their
explosion
by
a
medley
of
maniacal
cries
songs
shrieks
and
groans
commingled
it
was
as
though
a
shell
containing
a
voice
that
escaped
slowly
as
by
pressure
from
an
orifice
were
fired
past
my
ears
to
explode
and
liberate
the
voice
within
my
hearing
the
dreadful
utterance
was
not
an
echo
was
not
hallucination
it
was
real
i
stopped
and
looked
at
my
guide
in
amazement
he
explained
did
you
not
sometime
back
experience
that
your
own
voice
was
thrown
from
your
body
yes
i
answered
these
crazed
persons
or
rather
experiences
depraved
are
shouting
in
the
cavern
beyond
he
said
they
are
in
front
their
voices
pass
us
to
burst
into
expression
in
the
rear
then
even
as
he
spoke
from
a
fungus
stalk
near
us
a
hideous
creature
unfolded
itself
and
shambled
to
my
side
it
had
the
frame
of
a
man
and
yet
it
moved
like
a
serpent
writhing
towards
me
i
stepped
back
in
horror
but
the
tall
ungainly
creature
reached
out
an
arm
and
grasped
me
tightly
leaning
over
he
placed
his
hideous
mouth
close
to
my
ear
and
moaned
back
back
go
thou
back
i
made
no
reply
being
back
i
say
back
to
earth
or
he
hesitated
and
still
possessed
of
fear
and
unable
to
reply
i
was
silent
then
go
on
he
said
on
to
your
destiny
unhappy
man
and
slinking
back
to
the
fungus
whence
he
arose
he
disappeared
from
sight
come
said
my
guide
let
us
pass
the
drunkard
den
this
was
but
a
straggler
nerve
yourself
for
his
companions
will
soon
surround
us
chapter
xxxviii
the
drunkards
den
as
we
progressed
the
voices
in
our
rear
became
more
faint
and
yet
the
whistling
volleys
of
screeching
voice
bombs
passed
us
as
before
i
shuddered
in
anticipation
of
the
sight
that
was
surely
to
meet
our
gaze
and
could
not
but
tremble
for
fear
then
i
stopped
and
recoiled
for
at
my
very
feet
i
beheld
a
huge
living
human
head
it
rested
on
the
solid
rock
and
had
i
not
stopped
suddenly
when
i
did
i
would
have
kicked
it
at
the
next
leap
the
eyes
of
the
monster
were
fixed
in
supplication
on
my
face
the
great
brow
indicated
intelligence
the
mouth
denoted
refinement
the
head
denoted
brain
but
the
whole
constituted
a
monster
the
mouth
opened
and
a
whizzing
arrow
voice
swept
past
and
was
lost
in
the
distance
what
is
this
i
gasped
the
fate
of
a
drunkard
my
guide
replied
this
was
once
an
intelligent
man
but
now
he
has
lost
his
body
and
enslaved
his
soul
in
the
den
of
drink
beyond
us
and
has
been
brought
here
by
his
comrades
who
thus
rid
themselves
of
his
presence
here
he
must
rest
eternally
he
can
not
move
he
has
but
one
desire
drink
and
that
craving
deeper
than
life
can
not
be
satiated
but
he
desires
to
speak
speak
lower
man
or
head
of
man
if
you
wish
me
to
know
your
wants
i
said
and
leaned
toward
him
then
the
monster
whispered
and
i
caught
the
words
back
back
go
thou
back
i
made
no
reply
back
i
say
back
to
earth
or
still
i
remained
silent
then
go
on
he
said
on
to
your
destiny
unhappy
man
this
is
horrible
i
muttered
come
said
the
guide
let
us
proceed
and
we
moved
onward
now
i
perceived
many
such
heads
about
us
all
resting
upright
on
the
stony
floor
some
were
silent
others
were
shouting
others
still
were
whispering
and
endeavoring
to
attract
my
attention
as
we
hurried
on
i
saw
more
and
more
of
these
abnormal
creatures
some
were
in
rows
resting
against
each
other
leaving
barely
room
for
us
to
pass
between
but
at
last
much
to
my
relief
we
left
them
behind
us
but
i
found
that
i
had
no
cause
for
congratulation
when
i
felt
myself
clutched
by
a
powerful
hand
a
hand
as
large
as
that
of
a
man
fifty
feet
in
height
i
looked
about
expecting
to
see
a
gigantic
being
but
instead
beheld
a
shrunken
pigmy
the
whole
man
seemed
but
a
single
hand
a
brobdingnag
hand
affixed
to
the
body
of
a
liliputian
do
not
struggle
said
the
guide
listen
to
what
he
wishes
to
impart
i
leaned
over
placing
my
ear
close
to
the
mouth
of
the
monstrosity
back
back
go
thou
back
it
whispered
what
have
i
to
fear
i
asked
back
i
say
back
to
earth
or
or
what
i
said
then
go
on
on
to
your
destiny
unhappy
man
he
answered
and
the
hand
loosed
its
grasp
my
guide
drew
me
onward
then
from
about
us
huge
hands
arose
on
all
sides
they
waved
in
the
air
some
were
closed
and
were
shaken
as
clenched
fists
others
moved
aimlessly
with
spread
fingers
others
still
pointed
to
the
passage
we
had
traversed
and
in
a
confusion
of
whispers
i
heard
from
the
pigmy
figures
a
babble
of
cries
back
back
go
thou
back
again
i
hesitated
the
strain
upon
my
nerves
was
becoming
unbearable
i
glanced
backward
and
saw
a
swarm
of
misshaped
diminutive
forms
each
holding
up
a
monstrous
arm
and
hand
the
passage
behind
us
was
closed
against
retreat
every
form
possessed
but
one
hand
the
other
and
the
entire
body
seemingly
had
been
drawn
into
this
abnormal
member
while
i
thus
meditated
momentarily
as
by
a
single
thought
each
hand
closed
excepting
the
index
finger
and
in
unison
each
finger
pointed
towards
the
open
way
in
front
and
like
shafts
from
a
thousand
bows
i
felt
the
voices
whiz
past
me
and
then
from
the
rear
came
the
reverberation
as
a
complex
echo
then
go
on
on
to
your
destiny
unhappy
man
instinctively
i
sprang
forward
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
restraining
hand
of
my
guide
would
have
rushed
wildly
into
passages
that
might
have
ended
my
misery
for
god
only
knows
what
those
unseen
corridors
contained
i
was
aware
of
that
which
lay
behind
and
was
only
intent
on
escaping
from
the
horrid
figures
already
passed
illustration
each
finger
pointed
towards
the
open
way
in
front
hold
whispered
the
guide
as
you
value
your
life
stop
and
then
exerting
a
power
that
i
could
not
withstand
he
held
me
a
struggling
prisoner
listen
he
said
have
you
not
observed
that
these
creatures
do
not
seek
to
harm
you
have
not
all
of
them
spoken
kindly
have
any
offered
violence
no
i
replied
but
they
are
horrible
that
they
realize
but
fearing
that
you
will
prove
to
be
as
weak
as
they
have
been
and
will
become
as
they
are
now
they
warn
you
back
however
i
say
to
you
if
you
have
courage
sufficient
you
need
have
no
fear
come
rely
on
me
and
do
not
be
surprised
at
anything
that
appears
again
we
went
forward
i
realized
now
my
utter
helplessness
i
became
indifferent
again
i
could
neither
retrace
my
footsteps
alone
nor
guide
them
forward
in
the
path
i
was
to
pursue
i
submissively
relied
on
my
guide
and
as
stoical
as
he
appeared
to
be
i
moved
onward
to
new
scenes
we
came
to
a
great
chamber
which
as
we
halted
on
its
edge
seemed
to
be
a
prodigious
amphitheater
in
its
center
a
stone
of
a
hundred
feet
in
diameter
flat
and
circular
on
the
top
reared
itself
about
twelve
feet
above
the
floor
and
to
the
base
of
this
rostrum
the
floor
of
the
room
sloped
evenly
the
amphitheater
was
fully
a
thousand
feet
in
diameter
of
great
height
and
the
floor
was
literally
alive
with
grotesque
beings
imagination
could
not
depict
an
abnormal
human
form
that
did
not
exhibit
itself
to
my
startled
gaze
one
peculiarity
now
presented
itself
to
my
mind
each
abnormal
part
seemed
to
be
created
at
the
expense
of
the
remainder
of
the
body
thus
to
my
right
i
beheld
a
single
leg
fully
twelve
feet
in
height
surmounted
by
a
puny
human
form
which
on
this
leg
hopped
ludicrously
away
i
saw
close
behind
this
huge
limb
a
great
ear
attached
to
a
small
head
and
body
then
a
nose
so
large
that
the
figure
to
which
it
was
attached
was
forced
to
hold
the
face
upward
in
order
to
prevent
the
misshaped
organ
from
rubbing
on
the
stony
floor
here
a
gigantic
forehead
rested
on
a
shrunken
face
and
body
and
there
a
pair
of
enormous
feet
were
walking
seemingly
attached
to
the
body
of
a
child
and
yet
the
face
was
that
of
a
man
if
an
artist
were
to
attempt
to
create
as
many
revolting
figures
as
possible
each
with
some
member
out
of
proportion
to
the
rest
of
the
body
he
could
not
add
one
form
to
those
upon
this
floor
and
yet
i
again
observed
that
each
exaggerated
organ
seemed
to
have
drawn
itself
into
existence
by
absorbing
the
remainder
of
the
body
we
stood
on
the
edge
of
this
great
room
and
i
pondered
the
scene
before
my
eyes
at
length
my
guide
broke
the
silence
you
must
cross
this
floor
no
other
passage
is
known
mark
well
my
words
heed
my
advice
this
is
the
drunkards
den
these
men
are
lost
to
themselves
and
to
the
world
every
member
of
this
assembly
once
passed
onward
as
you
are
now
doing
in
charge
of
a
guide
they
failed
to
reach
the
goal
to
which
you
aspire
and
retreating
reached
this
chamber
to
become
victims
to
the
drink
habit
some
of
these
creatures
have
been
here
for
ages
others
only
for
a
short
period
why
are
they
so
distorted
i
asked
because
matter
is
now
only
partly
subservient
to
will
he
replied
the
intellect
and
mind
of
a
drunkard
on
surface
earth
becomes
abnormal
by
the
influence
of
an
intoxicant
but
his
real
form
is
unseen
although
evidently
misshapen
and
partly
subject
to
the
perception
of
a
few
only
of
his
fellow
men
could
you
see
the
inner
form
of
an
earth
surface
drunkard
you
would
perceive
as
great
a
mental
monstrosity
as
is
any
physical
monster
now
before
you
and
of
the
two
the
physically
abnormal
creature
is
really
the
least
objectionable
could
you
see
the
mind
configurations
of
an
assembly
of
surface
earth
topers
you
would
perceive
a
class
of
beings
as
much
distorted
mentally
as
are
these
physically
a
drunkard
is
a
monstrosity
on
surface
earth
the
mind
becomes
abnormal
here
the
body
suffers
why
is
it
i
asked
that
parts
of
these
creatures
shrink
away
as
some
special
organ
increases
because
the
abnormal
member
can
grow
only
by
abstracting
its
substance
from
the
other
portions
of
the
body
an
increasing
arm
enlarges
itself
by
drawing
its
strength
from
the
other
parts
hence
the
body
withers
as
the
hand
enlarges
and
in
turn
the
hand
shrinks
when
the
leg
increases
in
size
the
total
weight
of
the
individual
remains
about
the
same
men
on
earth
judge
of
men
not
by
what
they
are
but
by
what
they
seem
to
be
the
physical
form
is
apparent
to
the
sense
of
sight
the
real
man
is
unseen
however
as
the
boot
that
encloses
a
foot
can
not
altogether
hide
the
form
of
the
foot
within
so
the
body
that
encloses
the
life
entity
can
not
but
exhibit
here
and
there
the
character
of
the
dominating
spirit
within
thus
a
man
features
may
grow
to
indicate
the
nature
of
the
enclosed
spirit
for
the
controlling
character
of
that
spirit
will
gradually
impress
itself
on
the
material
part
of
man
even
on
surface
earth
where
the
matter
side
of
man
dominates
a
vicious
spirit
will
produce
a
villainous
countenance
a
mediocre
mind
a
vapid
face
and
an
amorous
soul
will
even
protrude
the
anterior
part
of
the
skull
carry
the
same
law
to
this
location
and
it
will
be
seen
that
as
mind
or
spirit
is
here
the
master
and
matter
is
the
slave
the
same
rule
should
under
natural
law
tend
to
produce
such
abnormal
figures
as
you
perceive
hence
the
part
of
a
man
spirit
that
is
endowed
most
highly
sways
the
corresponding
part
of
his
physical
body
at
the
expense
of
the
remainder
gradually
the
form
is
altered
under
the
relaxing
influence
of
this
fearful
intoxicant
and
eventually
but
one
organ
remains
to
tell
of
the
symmetrical
man
who
formerly
existed
then
when
he
is
no
longer
capable
of
the
comrades
carry
the
drunkard
fate
which
is
here
the
abnormal
being
you
have
seen
into
the
selected
corridor
and
deposit
it
among
others
of
its
kind
as
in
turn
the
bearers
are
destined
sometime
to
be
carried
by
others
we
reached
this
cavern
through
a
corridor
in
which
heads
and
arms
were
abnormal
but
in
others
may
be
found
great
feet
great
legs
or
other
portions
of
man
i
should
tell
you
furthermore
that
on
surface
earth
a
drunkard
is
not
less
abnormal
than
these
creatures
but
men
can
not
see
the
form
of
the
drunkard
spirit
could
they
perceive
the
image
of
the
real
man
life
that
corresponds
to
the
material
part
it
would
appear
not
less
distorted
and
hideous
the
soul
of
a
mortal
protrudes
from
the
visible
body
as
down
expands
from
a
thistle
seed
but
it
is
invisible
drink
drives
the
spirit
of
an
drunkard
to
unnatural
forms
not
less
grotesque
than
these
physical
distortions
could
you
see
the
real
drunkard
on
surface
earth
he
would
be
largely
outside
the
body
shell
and
hideous
in
the
extreme
as
a
rule
the
spirit
of
an
drunkard
dominates
the
nose
and
face
and
if
mortal
man
could
be
suddenly
gifted
with
the
sense
of
they
would
find
themselves
surrounded
by
persons
as
misshapen
as
any
delirious
imagination
can
conjure
luckily
for
humanity
this
scene
is
as
yet
withheld
from
man
for
life
would
otherwise
be
a
fearful
experience
because
man
has
not
the
power
to
resist
the
temptation
to
abuse
drink
tell
me
i
said
how
long
will
those
beings
rest
in
these
caverns
they
have
been
here
for
ages
replied
the
guide
they
are
doomed
to
remain
for
ages
yet
you
have
intimated
that
if
my
courage
fails
i
will
return
to
this
cavern
and
become
as
they
are
now
that
you
have
warned
me
of
my
doom
do
you
imagine
that
anything
even
sudden
death
can
swerve
me
from
my
journey
death
is
surely
preferable
to
such
an
existence
as
this
do
not
be
so
confident
every
individual
before
you
has
had
the
same
opportunity
and
has
been
warned
as
you
have
been
they
could
not
undergo
the
test
to
which
they
were
subjected
and
you
may
fail
besides
on
surface
earth
are
not
men
constantly
confronted
with
the
doom
of
the
drunkard
and
do
they
not
in
the
face
of
this
reality
turn
back
and
seek
his
caverns
the
journey
of
life
is
not
so
fearful
that
they
should
become
drunkards
to
shrink
from
its
responsibilities
you
have
reached
this
point
in
safety
you
have
passed
the
sentinels
without
and
will
soon
be
accosted
by
the
band
before
us
listen
well
now
to
my
advice
a
drunkard
always
seeks
to
gain
companions
to
draw
others
down
to
his
own
level
and
you
will
be
tried
as
never
have
you
been
before
taste
not
their
liquor
by
whatever
form
or
creature
presented
they
have
no
power
to
harm
him
who
has
courage
to
resist
if
they
entreat
you
refuse
if
they
threaten
refuse
if
they
offer
inducements
refuse
to
drink
let
your
answer
be
no
and
have
no
fear
if
your
strength
fail
you
mark
well
my
before
he
could
complete
his
sentence
i
felt
a
pressure
as
of
a
great
wind
and
suddenly
found
myself
seized
in
an
embrace
irresistible
and
then
helpless
as
a
feather
was
swept
out
into
the
cavern
of
the
drunkards
chapter
xxxix
among
the
drunkards
i
remember
once
to
have
stood
on
the
edge
of
niagara
great
whirlpool
but
not
more
fearful
did
its
seething
waters
then
seem
than
did
the
whirl
into
which
i
had
now
been
plunged
whether
my
guide
had
been
aware
of
the
coming
move
that
separated
us
i
never
knew
but
as
his
words
were
interrupted
i
infer
that
he
was
not
altogether
ready
to
part
from
my
company
be
this
as
it
may
he
disappeared
from
sight
and
as
by
a
concerted
move
the
cries
of
the
drunkards
subsided
instantly
i
found
myself
borne
high
in
the
air
perched
on
a
huge
hand
that
was
carried
by
its
comrades
it
seemed
as
though
the
contents
of
that
vast
hall
had
been
suddenly
thrown
beneath
me
for
as
i
looked
about
i
saw
all
around
a
sea
of
human
fragments
living
moving
parts
of
men
round
and
round
that
hall
we
circled
as
an
eddy
whirls
in
a
basin
and
not
less
silently
than
does
the
water
of
an
eddy
then
i
perceived
that
the
disjointed
mass
of
humanity
moved
as
a
spiral
in
unison
throbbing
like
a
vitalized
stream
bearing
me
submissively
on
its
surface
gradually
the
distance
between
myself
and
the
center
stone
lessened
and
then
i
found
that
as
if
carried
in
the
groove
of
a
gigantic
living
spiral
i
was
being
swept
towards
the
stone
platform
in
the
center
of
the
room
there
was
method
in
the
movements
of
the
drunkards
although
i
could
not
analyze
the
intricacies
of
their
complex
reel
finally
i
was
borne
to
the
center
stone
and
by
a
sudden
toss
of
the
hand
in
the
palm
of
which
i
was
seated
i
was
thrown
upon
the
raised
platform
then
in
unison
the
troop
swung
around
the
stone
and
i
found
myself
gazing
on
a
mass
of
vitalized
fragments
of
humanity
quickly
a
figure
sprung
upon
the
platform
and
in
him
i
discerned
a
seemingly
perfect
man
he
came
to
my
side
and
grasped
my
hand
as
if
he
were
a
friend
do
not
fear
he
said
obey
our
request
and
you
will
not
be
harmed
what
do
you
desire
i
asked
he
pointed
to
the
center
of
the
stone
and
i
saw
thereon
many
gigantic
inverted
fungus
bowls
the
gills
of
some
had
been
crushed
to
a
pulp
and
had
saturated
themselves
with
liquid
which
perhaps
by
a
species
of
fermentation
had
undergone
a
structural
change
others
were
as
yet
intact
others
still
contained
men
intently
cutting
the
gills
into
fragments
and
breaking
the
fruit
preparatory
to
further
manipulation
you
are
to
drink
with
us
he
replied
no
i
said
i
will
not
drink
then
you
must
die
to
refuse
to
drink
with
us
is
to
invite
death
so
mote
it
be
i
will
not
drink
we
stood
facing
each
other
apparently
both
meditating
on
the
situation
i
remember
to
have
been
surprised
not
that
the
man
before
me
had
been
able
to
spring
from
the
floor
to
the
table
rock
on
which
i
stood
but
that
so
fair
a
personage
could
have
been
a
companion
of
the
monstrosities
about
me
he
was
a
perfect
type
of
manhood
and
was
exquisitely
clothed
in
a
loose
flowing
robe
that
revealed
and
heightened
the
beauty
of
his
symmetrical
form
his
face
was
fair
yet
softly
tinted
with
rich
fresh
color
his
hair
and
beard
were
neatly
trimmed
his
manner
was
polished
and
his
countenance
frank
and
attractive
the
contrast
between
the
preternatural
shapes
from
among
whom
he
sprung
and
himself
was
as
between
a
demon
and
an
angel
i
marveled
that
i
had
not
perceived
him
before
for
such
a
one
should
have
been
conspicuous
because
so
fair
but
i
reflected
that
it
was
quite
natural
that
among
the
thousands
of
grotesque
persons
about
me
one
attractive
form
should
have
escaped
notice
presently
he
spoke
again
seemingly
having
repented
of
his
display
of
temper
i
am
a
friend
he
said
a
deliverer
i
will
serve
you
as
i
have
others
before
you
lean
on
me
listen
to
my
story
accept
my
proffered
friendship
then
he
continued
when
you
have
rested
i
will
guide
you
in
safety
back
to
upper
earth
and
restore
you
to
your
friends
i
could
not
resist
his
pleasing
promise
i
suddenly
and
unaccountably
believed
in
his
sincerity
he
impressed
me
with
confidence
in
his
truthfulness
yes
against
my
better
judgment
convinced
me
that
he
must
be
a
friend
a
savior
grasping
him
by
the
hand
i
thanked
him
for
his
interest
in
a
disconsolate
wanderer
and
assured
him
of
my
confidence
i
am
in
your
hands
i
said
i
will
obey
you
implicitly
i
thank
you
my
deliverer
lead
me
back
to
surface
earth
and
receive
the
gratitude
of
a
despairing
mortal
this
i
will
surely
do
he
said
rest
your
case
in
my
hands
do
not
concern
yourself
in
the
least
about
your
future
before
acquiescing
in
your
desire
however
i
will
explain
part
of
the
experiences
through
which
you
have
recently
passed
you
have
been
in
the
control
of
an
evil
spirit
and
have
been
deceived
the
grotesque
figures
the
abnormal
beings
about
you
exist
only
in
your
disordered
imagination
they
are
not
real
these
persons
are
happy
and
free
from
care
or
pain
they
live
in
bliss
inexpressible
they
have
a
life
within
a
life
and
the
outward
expression
that
you
have
perceived
is
as
the
uncouth
hide
and
figure
that
incloses
the
calm
peaceful
eye
of
a
toad
look
at
their
eyes
not
at
their
seemingly
distorted
forms
i
turned
to
the
throng
and
beheld
a
multitude
of
upturned
faces
mildly
beaming
upon
me
as
i
glanced
from
eye
to
eye
of
each
countenance
the
repulsive
figure
disappeared
from
my
view
and
a
sweet
expression
of
innocence
was
all
that
was
disclosed
to
me
i
realized
that
i
had
judged
by
the
outer
garment
i
had
wronged
these
a
sense
of
remorse
came
over
me
a
desire
to
atone
for
my
what
can
i
offer
as
a
retribution
i
asked
i
have
injured
these
people
listen
was
the
reply
these
serene
intelligences
are
happy
they
are
as
a
band
of
brothers
they
seek
to
do
you
a
kindness
to
save
you
from
disaster
one
hour
of
experience
such
as
they
enjoy
is
worth
a
hundred
years
of
the
pleasures
known
to
you
this
delicious
favor
an
hour
of
bliss
they
freely
offer
you
and
after
you
have
partaken
of
their
exquisite
joy
i
will
conduct
you
back
to
earth
surface
whenever
you
desire
to
leave
us
he
emphasized
the
word
desire
i
am
ready
i
replied
give
me
this
promised
delight
the
genial
allurer
turned
to
the
table
rock
behind
us
and
continued
in
these
fungus
bowls
we
foment
the
extract
of
life
the
precious
cordial
is
as
a
union
of
the
quintessential
spirits
of
joy
peace
tranquillity
happiness
and
delight
could
man
abstract
from
ecstasy
the
thing
that
underlies
the
sense
that
gives
that
word
a
meaning
his
product
would
not
approach
the
power
of
the
potent
liquids
in
these
vessels
of
what
are
they
composed
i
asked
of
derivatives
of
the
rarest
species
of
the
fungus
family
he
answered
they
are
made
by
formulæ
that
are
the
result
of
thousands
of
years
of
experimentation
come
let
us
not
delay
longer
the
hour
of
bliss
taking
me
by
the
hand
my
graceful
comrade
led
me
to
the
nearest
bowl
then
on
closer
view
i
perceived
that
its
contents
were
of
a
deep
green
color
and
in
active
commotion
and
although
no
vapor
was
apparent
a
delightful
sensation
impressed
my
faculties
i
am
not
sure
that
i
inhaled
at
all
the
feeling
was
one
of
penetration
of
subtile
magic
absorption
my
companion
took
a
tiny
shell
which
he
dipped
into
the
strange
cauldron
holding
the
tiny
cup
before
me
he
spoke
the
one
word
drink
ready
to
acquiesce
forgetful
of
the
warning
i
had
received
i
grasped
the
cup
and
raised
it
to
my
lips
and
as
i
did
so
chanced
to
glance
at
my
tempter
face
and
saw
not
the
supposed
friend
i
had
formerly
observed
but
as
through
a
mask
fair
in
outline
the
countenance
of
an
exulting
demon
regarding
me
with
a
sardonic
grin
in
an
instant
he
had
changed
from
man
to
devil
i
dashed
the
cup
upon
the
rock
no
i
will
not
drink
i
shouted
instantly
the
cavern
rung
with
cries
of
rage
a
thousand
voices
joined
as
by
accord
and
simultaneously
the
throng
of
fragments
of
men
began
to
revolve
again
the
mysterious
spiral
seemed
to
unwind
but
i
could
not
catch
the
method
of
its
movement
the
motion
was
like
that
of
an
uncoiling
serpent
bisected
lengthwise
the
two
halves
of
the
body
seeming
to
slide
against
each
other
gradually
that
part
of
the
cavern
near
the
stone
on
which
i
stood
became
clear
of
its
occupants
and
at
last
i
perceived
that
the
throng
had
receded
to
the
outer
edge
then
the
encircling
side
walls
of
the
amphitheater
became
visible
and
as
water
sinks
into
sand
the
medley
of
fragments
of
humanity
disappeared
from
view
i
turned
to
my
companion
he
too
had
vanished
i
glanced
towards
the
liquor
cauldrons
the
stone
was
bare
i
alone
occupied
the
gigantic
hall
no
trace
remained
to
tell
of
the
throng
that
a
short
time
previously
had
surrounded
and
mocked
me
desolate
distracted
i
threw
myself
upon
the
stone
and
cursed
my
miserable
self
come
back
i
cried
come
back
i
will
drink
drink
drink
chapter
xl
further
etidorhpa
then
as
my
voice
reverberated
from
the
outer
recesses
i
caught
a
sound
as
of
music
in
the
distance
i
raised
my
head
and
listened
yes
surely
there
was
music
the
melody
became
clearly
distinct
and
soon
my
senses
were
aware
that
both
vocal
and
instrumental
music
were
combined
the
airs
which
came
floating
were
sweet
simple
and
beautiful
the
voices
and
accompanying
strains
approached
but
i
could
distinguish
no
words
by
and
by
from
the
corridors
of
the
cavern
troops
of
bright
female
forms
floated
into
view
they
were
clad
in
robes
ranging
from
pure
white
to
every
richest
hue
contrasting
strangely
and
in
the
distance
their
rainbow
brilliancy
made
a
gorgeous
spectacle
some
were
fantastically
attired
in
short
gowns
such
as
i
imagine
were
worn
by
the
dancing
girls
of
sacred
history
others
had
kirtles
of
a
single
bright
color
others
of
many
shades
intermingled
while
others
still
were
dressed
in
fabrics
of
pure
white
as
they
filed
into
the
cavern
and
approached
me
they
formed
into
platoons
or
into
companies
and
then
as
dissolving
views
come
and
go
they
presented
first
one
and
then
another
figure
sometimes
they
would
stretch
in
great
circling
lines
around
the
hall
again
they
would
form
into
squares
and
again
into
geometrical
figures
of
all
shades
and
forms
but
i
observed
that
with
every
change
they
drew
nearer
to
the
stone
on
which
i
rested
they
were
now
so
near
that
their
features
could
be
distinguished
and
never
before
had
i
seen
such
loveliness
in
human
mold
every
face
was
as
perfect
as
a
master
picture
of
the
madonna
and
yet
no
two
seemed
to
possess
the
same
type
of
beauty
some
were
of
dark
complexion
with
glossy
raven
hair
others
were
fair
with
hair
ranging
from
light
brown
to
golden
the
style
of
head
dress
as
a
rule
was
of
the
simplest
description
a
tinted
ribbon
or
twisted
cord
over
the
head
bound
their
hair
with
becoming
grace
and
their
silken
locks
were
either
plaited
into
braids
curled
into
ringlets
or
hung
loosely
flowing
in
wavelets
about
their
shoulders
some
held
curious
musical
instruments
others
beautiful
wands
and
altogether
they
produced
a
scenic
effect
of
rare
beauty
that
the
most
extravagant
dream
of
fairyland
could
not
surpass
thus
it
was
that
i
became
again
the
center
of
a
throng
not
of
repulsive
monsters
but
of
marvelously
lovely
beings
they
were
as
different
from
those
preceding
as
darkness
is
from
daylight
could
any
man
from
the
data
of
my
past
experiences
have
predicted
such
a
scene
never
before
had
the
semblance
of
a
woman
appeared
never
before
had
an
intimation
been
given
that
the
gentle
sex
existed
in
these
silent
chambers
now
from
the
grotesque
figures
and
horrible
cries
of
the
former
occupants
of
this
same
cavern
the
scene
had
changed
to
a
conception
of
the
beautiful
and
artistic
such
as
a
poetic
spirit
might
evolve
in
an
extravagant
dream
of
higher
fairy
land
i
glanced
above
the
great
hall
was
clothed
in
brilliant
colors
the
bare
rocks
had
disappeared
the
dome
of
that
vast
arch
reaching
to
an
immeasurable
height
was
decorated
in
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
flags
and
streamers
fluttered
in
breezes
that
also
moved
the
garments
of
the
angelic
throng
about
me
but
which
i
could
not
sense
profiles
of
enchanting
faces
pervaded
the
glimmering
space
beyond
i
alone
was
but
an
onlooker
not
a
participant
of
the
joys
about
me
the
movements
of
the
figures
continued
innumerable
forms
and
figures
followed
forms
and
figures
innumerable
and
music
indescribable
blended
with
the
poetry
of
motion
i
was
rapt
the
past
disappeared
my
former
mind
was
blotted
from
existence
the
world
vanished
and
i
became
a
thrill
of
joy
a
sensation
of
absolute
delight
the
band
of
spirits
or
fairy
forms
reached
the
rock
at
my
feet
but
i
did
not
know
how
long
a
time
they
consumed
in
doing
this
it
may
have
been
a
second
and
it
may
have
been
an
eternity
neither
did
i
care
a
single
moment
of
existence
such
as
i
experienced
seemed
worth
an
age
of
any
other
pleasure
circling
about
me
these
ethereal
creatures
paused
from
their
motions
and
as
the
music
ceased
i
stood
above
them
and
yet
in
their
midst
and
gazed
out
into
a
distance
illimitable
but
not
less
beautiful
in
the
expanse
than
was
the
adjacent
part
the
cavern
had
altogether
disappeared
and
in
the
depths
about
me
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
seemingly
into
the
broad
expanse
of
heaven
i
saw
the
exquisite
forms
that
i
have
so
imperfectly
described
then
a
single
band
from
the
throng
lightly
sprung
upon
the
stony
terrace
where
i
stood
and
sung
and
danced
before
me
every
motion
was
perfect
as
imagination
could
depict
every
sound
was
concentrated
extract
of
melody
this
band
retired
to
be
replaced
by
another
which
in
turn
gave
way
to
another
and
still
another
until
as
in
space
we
have
no
standard
time
vanished
and
numbers
ceased
to
be
numbers
no
two
of
the
band
of
dancers
were
clothed
alike
no
two
songs
were
similar
though
all
were
inexpressibly
enchanting
the
first
group
seemed
perfect
and
yet
the
second
was
better
and
each
succeeding
band
sung
sweeter
songs
were
more
beautiful
and
richer
in
dress
than
those
preceding
i
became
enveloped
in
the
æsthetic
atmosphere
my
spirit
seemed
to
be
loosened
from
the
body
it
was
apparently
upon
the
point
of
escaping
from
its
mortal
frame
suddenly
the
music
ceased
the
figures
about
became
passive
and
every
form
standing
upright
and
graceful
gazed
upon
my
face
and
as
i
looked
at
the
radiant
creatures
each
successive
face
in
turn
seemed
to
grow
more
beautiful
each
form
more
exquisite
than
those
about
then
in
the
distance
i
observed
the
phalanx
divide
forming
into
two
divisions
separated
by
a
broad
aisle
stretching
from
my
feet
to
the
limit
of
space
without
and
down
this
aisle
i
observed
a
single
figure
advancing
toward
me
as
she
approached
the
phalanx
closed
in
behind
her
and
when
at
last
she
reached
the
stone
on
which
i
stood
she
stepped
or
was
wafted
to
my
side
and
the
phalanx
behind
moved
together
and
was
complete
again

my
name
from
time
record
and
the
lovely
daughters
of
zeus
and
dione
would
disappear
and
with
them
would
vanish
the
grace
and
beauty
of
woman
the
sweet
conception
of
the
froth
child
of
the
cyprus
sea
would
be
lost
venus
the
goddess
of
love
would
have
no
place
in
song
and
love
herself
the
holiest
conception
of
the
poet
man
superlative
conception
of
heaven
most
precious
charms
would
be
buried
with
the
myrtle
and
the
rose
my
name
is
etidorhpa
interpret
it
rightly
and
you
have
what
has
been
to
humanity
the
essence
of
love
the
mother
of
all
that
ennobles
he
who
loves
a
wife
worships
me
she
who
in
turn
makes
a
home
happy
is
typical
of
me
i
am
etidorhpa
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
earth
behold
in
me
the
antithesis
of
envy
the
opposite
of
malice
the
enemy
of
sorrow
the
mistress
of
life
the
queen
of
immortal
bliss
do
you
know
she
continued
and
her
voice
soft
and
sweet
carried
with
it
a
pleasurable
sense
of
truthfulness
indescribable
do
you
know
that
man
idea
of
heaven
places
me
etidorhpa
on
the
highest
throne
with
the
charm
of
maiden
pure
i
combine
the
devotion
of
wife
and
the
holiness
of
mother
take
from
the
life
of
man
the
treasures
i
embody
and
he
will
be
homeless
childless
loveless
the
thought
of
heaven
will
in
such
a
case
be
as
the
dismal
conception
of
a
dreary
platitude
a
life
in
such
a
heaven
a
heaven
devoid
of
love
and
this
the
scriptures
teach
is
one
of
endless
torment
love
by
whatever
name
the
conception
is
designated
rules
the
world
divest
the
cold
man
of
science
of
the
bond
that
binds
him
to
his
and
his
work
is
ended
strike
from
the
master
in
music
the
chord
that
links
his
soul
to
the
voice
he
breathes
and
his
songs
will
be
hushed
deaden
the
sense
of
love
which
the
artist
bears
his
art
and
as
the
spirit
that
underlies
his
vanishes
his
touch
becomes
chilled
and
his
brush
inexpressive
the
soldier
thinks
of
his
home
and
country
and
without
a
murmur
sheds
his
life
blood
and
yet
there
are
debasing
phases
of
love
for
as
love
of
country
builds
a
nation
so
love
of
pillage
may
destroy
it
love
of
the
holy
and
the
beautiful
stands
in
human
life
opposed
to
love
of
the
debasing
and
vicious
and
i
etidorhpa
am
typical
of
the
highest
love
of
man
as
the
same
force
binds
the
molecules
of
the
rose
and
the
violet
as
well
as
those
of
noxious
drugs
so
the
same
soul
conception
may
serve
the
love
of
good
or
the
love
of
evil
love
may
guide
a
tyrant
or
actuate
a
saint
may
make
man
torture
his
fellow
or
strive
to
ease
his
pain
thus
man
propensity
to
serve
his
holy
or
his
evil
passion
may
each
be
called
a
degree
in
love
and
in
the
serving
of
that
passion
the
love
of
one
heart
may
express
itself
as
the
antithesis
of
love
in
another
as
bitter
is
to
some
men
taste
more
pleasant
than
sweet
and
sour
is
yet
more
grateful
to
others
so
one
man
may
love
the
beautiful
another
delight
in
the
grotesque
and
a
third
may
love
to
see
his
neighbor
suffer
amid
these
the
phase
of
love
that
ennobles
brings
the
greatest
degree
of
pleasure
and
comfort
to
mankind
but
the
love
that
degrades
is
love
nevertheless
by
whatever
name
the
expression
of
the
passion
may
be
called
love
rules
the
world
and
typical
of
man
intensest
holiest
love
i
etidorhpa
stand
the
soul
of
love
supreme
she
hesitated
go
on
i
have
already
said
and
in
saying
this
have
told
the
truth
i
come
from
beyond
the
empty
shell
of
a
materialistic
gold
and
silver
conception
of
heaven
go
with
me
and
in
my
home
you
will
find
soul
devotion
regardless
of
material
surroundings
i
have
said
and
truly
the
corridors
of
the
heaven
mansion
enriched
by
precious
stones
and
metals
fine
but
destitute
of
my
smiles
and
graces
are
deserted
the
golden
calf
is
no
longer
worshiped
cobwebs
cling
in
festoons
motionless
and
the
dust
of
selfish
thoughts
perverted
dry
and
black
as
the
soot
from
satan
fires
settling
therein
as
the
dust
of
an
antiquated
sarcophagus
rest
undisturbed

on
one
side
the
heaven
of
which
misers
sing
and
on
the
other
etidorhpa
and
the
treasures
that
come
with
me
to
man
and
woman
for
without
me
neither
wife
child
nor
father
could
exist
and
from
any
other
heaven
mankind
will
turn
away
the
noblest
gift
of
heaven
to
humanity
is
the
highest
sense
of
love
and
i
etidorhpa
am
the
soul
of
love
she
ceased
speaking
and
as
i
looked
at
the
form
beside
me
i
forgot
myself
in
the
rapture
of
that
gaze
crush
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
into
a
single
hue
possessed
of
the
attributes
of
all
the
others
and
multiply
that
entity
to
infinity
and
you
have
less
richness
than
rested
in
any
of
the
complex
colors
shown
in
the
trimming
of
her
raiment
lighten
the
softness
of
eiderdown
a
thousand
times
and
yet
maintain
its
sense
of
substance
and
you
have
not
conceived
of
the
softness
of
the
gauze
that
decked
her
simple
flowing
garments
gather
the
shadows
cast
by
a
troop
of
radiant
angels
then
sprinkle
the
resultant
shade
with
star
dust
and
color
therewith
a
garment
brighter
than
satin
softer
than
silk
and
more
ethereal
than
light
itself
and
you
have
less
beauty
than
reposed
in
the
modest
dress
that
enveloped
her
figure
abstract
the
perfume
from
the
sweetest
oriental
grasses
and
combine
with
it
the
essential
spirit
of
the
wild
rose
then
add
thereto
the
soul
of
ambergris
and
the
quintessential
extracts
of
the
finest
aromatics
of
the
east
and
you
have
not
approached
the
exquisite
fragrance
that
penetrated
my
very
being
at
her
approach
she
stood
before
me
slender
lithe
symmetrical
radiant
her
hair
was
more
beautiful
than
pen
can
depict
it
was
colorless
because
it
can
not
be
described
by
colors
known
to
mortals
her
face
paled
the
beauty
of
all
who
had
preceded
her
she
could
not
be
a
fairy
for
no
conception
of
a
fairy
can
approach
such
loveliness
she
was
not
a
spirit
for
surely
material
substance
was
a
part
of
her
form
she
was
not
an
angel
for
no
abnormal
irrational
wing
protruded
from
her
shoulder
to
blemish
her
seraphic
figure
no
i
said
musingly
she
is
a
creature
of
other
climes
the
scriptures
tell
of
no
such
being
she
is
neither
human
nor
angelic
but
but
what
she
said
i
do
not
know
i
answered
then
i
will
tell
you
she
replied
yes
i
will
tell
you
of
myself
and
of
my
companions
i
will
show
you
our
home
carrying
you
through
the
shadows
of
heaven
to
exhibit
that
fair
land
for
heaven
without
etidorhpa
casts
a
shadow
in
comparison
therewith
see
she
said
as
with
her
dainty
fingers
she
removed
from
her
garment
a
fragment
of
transparent
film
that
i
had
not
previously
observed
see
this
is
a
cobweb
that
clung
to
my
skirt
as
on
my
way
to
meet
you
i
passed
through
the
dismal
corridors
of
the
materialists
loveless
heaven
she
dropped
it
on
the
floor
and
i
stooped
to
pick
it
up
but
vainly
my
fingers
passed
through
it
as
through
a
mist
you
must
be
an
angel
i
stammered
she
smiled
come
she
said
do
not
consume
your
time
with
thoughts
of
materialistic
heaven
come
with
me
to
that
brighter
land
beyond
and
in
those
indescribable
scenes
we
you
and
i
will
wander
together
forever
she
held
out
her
hand
i
hesitatingly
touched
it
and
then
raised
it
to
my
lips
she
made
no
resistance
i
dropped
upon
my
knees
are
you
to
be
mine
i
cried
mine
forever
yes
she
answered
if
you
will
it
for
he
who
loves
will
be
loved
in
turn
i
will
do
it
i
said
i
give
myself
to
you
be
you
what
you
may
be
your
home
where
it
may
i
give
up
the
earth
behind
me
and
the
hope
of
heaven
before
me
the
here
and
the
hereafter
i
will
sacrifice
let
us
hasten
i
said
for
she
made
no
movement
she
shook
her
head
you
must
yet
be
tempted
as
never
before
and
you
must
resist
the
tempter
you
can
not
pass
into
the
land
of
etidorhpa
until
you
have
suffered
as
only
the
damned
can
suffer
until
you
have
withstood
the
pangs
of
thirst
and
have
experienced
heat
and
cold
indescribable
remember
the
warning
of
your
former
guide
mark
well
the
words
of
etidorhpa
you
must
not
yield
was
to
serve
you
that
i
came
before
you
now
was
to
preserve
you
from
the
drunkard
cavern
that
i
have
given
you
this
vision
of
the
land
beyond
the
end
of
earth
where
if
you
will
serve
yourself
we
will
meet
again
she
held
aloft
two
tiny
cups
i
sprung
to
my
feet
and
grasped
one
of
them
and
as
i
glanced
at
the
throng
in
front
of
me
every
radiant
figure
held
aloft
in
the
left
hand
a
similar
cup
all
were
gazing
in
my
face
i
looked
at
the
transparent
cup
in
my
hand
it
appeared
to
be
partly
filled
with
a
green
liquid
i
looked
at
her
cup
and
saw
that
it
contained
a
similar
fluid
forgetting
the
warning
she
had
so
recently
given
i
raised
the
cup
to
my
lips
and
just
before
touching
it
glanced
again
at
her
face
the
fair
creature
stood
with
bowed
head
her
face
covered
with
her
hand
her
very
form
and
attitude
spoke
of
sorrow
and
disappointment
and
she
trembled
in
distress
she
held
one
hand
as
though
to
thrust
back
a
form
that
seemed
about
to
force
itself
beyond
her
figure
for
peering
exultingly
from
behind
leered
the
same
satanic
face
that
met
my
gaze
on
the
preceding
occasion
when
in
the
presence
of
the
troop
of
demons
i
had
been
tempted
by
the
perfect
man
dashing
the
cup
to
the
floor
i
shouted
no
i
will
not
drink
etidorhpa
dropped
upon
her
knees
and
clasped
her
hands
the
satanic
figure
disappeared
from
sight
realizing
that
we
had
triumphed
over
the
tempter
i
also
fell
upon
my
knees
in
thankfulness
chapter
xli
misery
as
all
the
bubbles
in
a
glass
shrink
and
vanish
when
the
first
collapses
so
the
troop
of
forms
before
me
disintegrated
and
were
gone
the
delicate
being
whose
hand
i
held
fluttered
as
does
a
mist
in
the
first
gust
of
a
sudden
gale
and
then
dissolved
into
transparency
the
gaily
decked
amphitheater
disappeared
the
very
earth
cavern
passed
from
existence
and
i
found
myself
standing
solitary
and
alone
in
a
boundless
desert
i
turned
towards
every
point
of
the
compass
only
to
find
that
no
visible
object
appeared
to
break
the
monotony
i
stood
upon
a
floor
of
pure
white
sand
which
stretched
to
the
horizon
in
gentle
undulations
as
if
the
swell
of
the
ocean
had
been
caught
transformed
to
sand
and
fixed
i
bent
down
and
scooped
a
handful
of
the
sand
and
raised
it
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
letting
it
sift
back
again
to
earth
it
was
surely
sand
i
pinched
my
flesh
and
pulled
my
hair
i
tore
my
garments
stamped
upon
the
sand
and
shouted
aloud
to
demonstrate
that
i
myself
was
still
myself
it
was
real
yes
real
i
stood
alone
in
a
desert
of
sand
morning
was
dawning
and
on
one
side
the
great
sun
rose
slowly
and
majestically
thank
god
for
the
sun
i
cried
thank
god
for
the
light
and
heat
of
the
sun
i
was
again
on
surface
earth
once
more
i
beheld
that
glorious
orb
for
the
sight
of
which
i
had
so
often
prayed
when
i
believed
myself
miserable
in
the
dismal
earth
caverns
and
which
i
had
been
willing
to
give
my
very
life
once
more
to
behold
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
raised
my
hands
in
thankfulness
i
blessed
the
rising
sun
the
illimitable
sand
the
air
about
me
and
the
blue
heavens
above
i
blessed
all
that
was
before
me
and
again
and
again
returned
thanks
for
my
delivery
from
the
caverns
beneath
me
i
did
not
think
to
question
by
what
power
this
miracle
had
been
accomplished
i
did
not
care
to
do
so
had
i
thought
of
the
matter
at
all
i
would
not
have
dared
to
question
for
fear
the
transition
might
prove
a
delusion
i
turned
towards
the
sun
and
walked
eastward
as
the
day
progressed
and
the
sun
rose
into
the
heavens
i
maintained
my
journey
aiming
as
best
i
could
to
keep
the
same
direction
the
heat
increased
and
when
the
sun
reached
the
zenith
it
seemed
as
though
it
would
melt
the
marrow
in
my
bones
the
sand
as
white
as
snow
and
hot
as
lava
dazzled
my
eyes
and
i
covered
them
with
my
hands
the
sun
in
the
sky
felt
as
if
it
were
a
ball
of
white
hot
iron
near
my
head
it
seemed
small
and
yet
appeared
to
shine
as
through
a
tube
directed
only
towards
myself
vainly
did
i
struggle
to
escape
and
get
beyond
its
boundary
the
tube
seemed
to
follow
my
every
motion
directing
the
blazing
shafts
and
concentrating
them
ever
upon
my
defenseless
person
i
removed
my
outer
garments
and
tore
my
shirt
into
fibers
hoping
to
catch
a
waft
of
breeze
and
with
one
hand
over
my
eyes
and
the
other
holding
my
coat
above
my
head
endeavored
to
escape
the
mighty
flood
of
heat
but
vainly
the
fiery
rays
streamed
through
the
garment
as
mercury
flows
through
a
film
of
gauze
they
penetrated
my
flesh
and
vaporized
my
blood
my
hands
fingers
and
arms
puffed
out
as
a
bladder
of
air
expands
under
the
influence
of
heat
my
face
swelled
to
twice
thrice
its
normal
size
and
at
last
my
eyes
were
closed
for
my
cheeks
and
eyebrows
met
i
rubbed
my
shapeless
hand
over
my
sightless
face
and
found
it
as
round
as
a
ball
the
nose
had
become
imbedded
in
the
expanded
flesh
and
my
ears
had
disappeared
in
the
same
manner
i
could
no
longer
see
the
sun
but
felt
the
vivid
piercing
rays
i
could
not
evade
i
do
not
know
whether
i
walked
or
rolled
along
i
only
know
that
i
struggled
to
escape
those
deadly
rays
then
i
prayed
for
death
and
in
the
same
breath
begged
the
powers
that
had
transferred
me
to
surface
earth
to
carry
me
back
again
to
the
caverns
below
the
recollection
of
their
cool
refreshing
atmosphere
was
as
the
thought
of
heaven
must
be
to
a
lost
spirit
i
experienced
the
agony
of
a
damned
soul
and
now
in
contradistinction
to
former
times
considered
as
my
idea
of
perfect
happiness
the
dismal
earth
caverns
of
other
days
i
thought
of
the
day
i
had
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
kentucky
cave
and
waded
into
the
water
with
my
guide
i
recalled
the
refreshing
coolness
of
the
stream
in
the
darkness
of
that
cavern
when
the
last
ray
of
sunshine
disappeared
and
i
cursed
myself
for
longing
then
for
sunshine
and
the
surface
earth
fool
that
man
is
i
mentally
cried
not
to
be
contented
with
that
which
is
however
he
may
be
situated
and
wherever
he
may
be
placed
this
is
but
a
retribution
i
am
being
cursed
for
my
discontented
mind
this
is
hell
and
in
comparison
with
this
hell
all
else
on
or
in
earth
is
happiness
then
i
damned
the
sun
the
earth
the
very
god
of
all
and
in
my
frenzy
cursed
everything
that
existed
i
felt
my
puffed
limbs
and
prayed
that
i
might
become
lean
again
i
asked
to
shrink
to
a
skeleton
for
seemingly
my
misery
came
with
my
expanded
form
but
i
prayed
and
cursed
in
vain
so
i
struggled
on
in
agony
every
moment
seemingly
covering
a
multitude
of
years
struggled
along
like
a
lost
soul
plodding
in
an
endless
expanse
of
hell
at
last
however
the
day
declined
the
heat
decreased
and
as
it
did
so
my
distorted
body
gradually
regained
its
normal
size
my
eyesight
returned
and
finally
i
stood
in
that
wilderness
of
sand
watching
the
great
red
sun
sink
into
the
earth
as
in
the
morning
i
had
watched
it
rise
but
between
the
sunrise
and
the
sunset
there
had
been
an
eternity
of
suffering
and
then
as
if
released
from
a
spell
i
dropped
exhausted
upon
the
sand
and
seemed
to
sleep
i
dreamed
of
the
sun
and
that
an
angel
stood
before
me
and
asked
why
i
was
miserable
and
in
reply
i
pointed
to
the
sun
see
i
said
the
author
of
the
misery
of
man
said
the
angel
were
there
no
sun
there
would
be
no
men
but
were
there
no
men
there
would
still
be
misery
misery
of
what
i
asked
misery
of
mind
replied
the
angel
misery
is
a
thing
misery
is
not
a
conception
pain
is
real
pain
is
not
an
impression
misery
and
pain
would
still
exist
and
prey
upon
mind
substance
were
there
no
men
for
mind
also
is
real
and
not
a
mere
conception
the
pain
you
have
suffered
has
not
been
the
pain
of
matter
but
the
pain
of
spirit
matter
can
not
suffer
were
it
matter
that
suffered
the
heated
sand
would
writhe
in
agony
no
it
is
only
mind
and
spirit
that
experience
pain
or
pleasure
and
neither
mind
nor
spirit
can
evade
its
destiny
even
if
it
escape
from
the
body
then
i
awoke
and
saw
once
more
the
great
red
sun
rise
from
the
of
my
desolate
world
and
i
became
aware
of
a
new
pain
for
now
i
perceived
the
fact
that
i
experienced
the
sense
of
thirst
the
conception
of
the
impression
drew
my
mind
to
the
subject
and
instantly
intense
thirst
the
most
acute
of
bodily
sufferings
possessed
me
when
vitalized
tissue
craves
water
other
physical
wants
are
unfelt
when
man
parches
to
death
all
other
methods
of
torture
are
disregarded
i
thought
no
longer
of
the
rising
sun
i
remembered
no
more
the
burning
sand
of
yesterday
i
felt
only
the
pain
of
thirst
water
water
water
i
cried
and
then
in
the
distance
as
if
in
answer
to
my
cry
i
beheld
a
lake
of
water
instantly
every
nerve
was
strained
every
muscle
stretched
and
i
fled
over
the
sands
towards
the
welcome
pool
on
and
on
i
ran
and
as
i
did
so
the
sun
rising
higher
and
higher
again
began
to
burn
the
sands
beneath
my
feet
and
roast
the
flesh
upon
my
bones
once
more
i
experienced
that
intolerable
sense
of
pain
the
pain
of
living
flesh
disintegrating
by
fire
and
now
with
thirst
gnawing
at
my
vitals
and
fire
drying
up
the
residue
of
my
evaporated
blood
i
struggled
in
agony
towards
a
lake
that
vanished
before
my
gaze
to
reappear
just
beyond
this
day
was
more
horrible
than
the
preceding
and
yet
it
was
the
reverse
so
far
as
the
action
of
the
sun
on
my
flesh
was
concerned
my
prayer
of
yesterday
had
been
fearfully
answered
and
the
curses
of
the
day
preceding
were
being
visited
upon
my
very
self
i
had
prayed
to
become
lean
and
instead
of
the
former
puffed
tissue
and
expanded
flesh
my
body
contracted
as
does
beef
when
dried
the
tightening
skin
squeezed
upon
the
solidifying
flesh
and
as
the
moisture
evaporated
it
left
a
shriveled
integument
contracted
close
upon
the
bone
my
joints
stood
out
as
great
protuberances
my
skin
turned
to
a
dark
amber
color
and
my
flesh
became
transparent
as
does
wetted
horn
i
saw
my
very
vitals
throb
i
saw
the
empty
blood
vessels
the
shriveled
nerves
and
vacant
arteries
of
my
frame
i
could
not
close
my
eyes
i
could
not
shield
them
from
the
burning
sun
i
was
a
mummy
yet
living
a
dried
corpse
walking
over
the
sand
dead
to
all
save
pain
i
tried
to
fall
but
could
not
and
i
felt
that
while
the
sun
was
visible
i
must
stand
upright
i
could
not
stop
and
could
not
stoop
then
at
last
the
malevolent
sun
sank
beneath
the
horizon
and
as
the
last
ray
disappeared
again
i
fell
upon
the
sand
i
did
not
sleep
i
did
not
rest
i
did
not
breathe
nor
live
a
human
i
only
existed
as
a
living
pain
the
conception
of
pain
realized
into
a
conscious
nucleus
and
so
the
night
passed
again
the
sun
arose
and
with
the
light
of
her
first
ray
i
saw
near
at
hand
a
caravan
camels
men
horses
a
great
cavalcade
they
approached
rapidly
and
surrounded
me
the
leader
of
the
band
alighted
and
raised
me
to
my
feet
for
no
longer
had
i
the
power
of
motion
he
spoke
to
me
kindly
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
you
but
not
at
all
strange
did
it
seem
to
me
called
me
by
name
we
came
across
your
tracks
in
the
desert
he
said
we
are
your
deliverers
i
motioned
for
water
i
could
not
speak
yes
he
said
water
you
shall
have
then
from
one
of
the
skins
that
hung
across
the
hump
of
a
camel
he
filled
a
crystal
goblet
with
sparkling
water
and
held
it
towards
me
but
just
before
the
goblet
touched
my
lips
he
withdrew
it
and
said
i
forgot
to
first
extend
the
greetings
of
our
people
and
then
i
noticed
in
his
other
hand
a
tiny
glass
containing
a
green
liquid
which
he
placed
to
my
lips
pronouncing
the
single
word
drink
i
fastened
my
gaze
upon
the
water
and
opened
my
lips
i
smelled
the
aroma
of
the
powerful
narcotic
liquid
within
the
glass
and
hastened
to
obey
but
glanced
first
at
my
deliverer
and
in
his
stead
saw
the
familiar
face
of
the
satanic
figure
that
twice
before
had
tempted
me
instantly
without
a
thought
as
to
the
consequences
without
a
fear
as
to
the
result
i
dashed
the
glass
to
the
sand
and
my
voice
returning
i
cried
for
the
third
time
no
i
will
not
drink
the
troop
of
camels
instantly
disappeared
as
had
the
figures
in
the
scenes
before
the
tempter
resolved
into
clear
air
the
sand
beneath
my
feet
became
natural
again
and
i
became
myself
as
i
had
been
before
passing
through
the
hideous
ordeal
the
fact
of
my
deliverance
from
the
earth
caverns
had
i
now
realized
been
followed
by
temporary
aberration
of
my
mind
but
at
last
i
saw
clearly
again
the
painful
fancy
had
passed
the
delirium
was
over
i
fell
upon
my
knees
in
thankfulness
the
misery
through
which
i
had
passed
had
proven
to
be
illusory
the
earth
caverns
were
beneath
me
the
mirage
and
temptations
were
not
real
the
horrors
i
had
experienced
were
imaginary
thank
god
for
all
this
and
that
the
sand
was
really
sand
solitary
alone
i
kneeled
in
the
desert
barren
from
horizon
to
horizon
desolation
only
surrounded
and
yet
the
scene
of
that
illimitable
waste
a
fearful
reality
it
is
true
was
sweet
in
comparison
with
the
misery
of
body
and
soul
about
which
i
had
dreamed
so
vividly
is
no
wonder
i
said
to
myself
that
in
the
moment
of
transition
from
the
underground
caverns
to
the
sunshine
above
the
shock
should
have
disturbed
my
mental
equilibrium
and
in
the
moment
of
reaction
i
should
have
dreamed
fantastic
and
horrible
imaginings
a
cool
and
refreshing
breeze
sprung
now
from
i
know
not
where
i
did
not
care
to
ask
it
was
too
welcome
a
gift
to
question
and
contrasted
pleasantly
with
the
misery
of
my
past
hallucination
the
sun
was
shining
hot
above
me
the
sand
was
glowing
parched
beneath
me
and
yet
the
grateful
breeze
fanned
my
brow
and
refreshed
my
spirit
thank
god
i
cried
for
the
breeze
for
the
coolness
that
it
brings
only
those
who
have
experienced
the
silence
of
the
cavern
solitudes
through
which
i
have
passed
and
added
thereto
have
sensed
the
horrors
of
the
more
recent
nightmare
scenes
can
appreciate
the
delights
of
a
gust
of
air
the
incongruity
of
surrounding
conditions
as
connected
with
affairs
rational
did
not
appeal
at
all
to
my
questioning
senses
it
seemed
as
though
the
cool
breeze
coming
from
out
the
illimitable
desolation
of
a
heated
waste
was
natural
i
arose
and
walked
on
refreshed
from
out
that
breeze
my
physical
self
drew
refreshment
and
strength
is
the
cold
i
said
the
blessed
antithesis
of
heat
that
supports
life
heat
enervates
cold
stimulates
heat
depresses
cold
animates
thank
god
for
breezes
winds
waters
cold
i
turned
and
faced
the
gladsome
breeze
is
the
source
of
life
i
will
trace
it
to
its
origin
i
will
leave
the
accursed
desert
the
hateful
sunshine
and
seek
the
blissful
regions
that
give
birth
to
cool
breezes
i
walked
rapidly
and
the
breeze
became
more
energetic
and
cooler
with
each
increase
of
momentum
on
my
part
corresponding
strength
seemed
to
be
added
to
the
breeze
both
strength
and
coolness
is
not
this
delightful
i
murmured
my
god
at
last
has
come
to
be
a
just
god
knowing
what
i
wanted
he
sent
the
breeze
in
answer
to
my
prayer
the
cool
refreshing
breeze
arose
damn
the
heat
i
cried
aloud
as
i
thought
of
the
horrid
day
before
blessed
be
the
cold
and
as
though
in
answer
to
my
cry
the
breeze
stiffened
and
the
cold
strengthened
itself
and
i
again
returned
thanks
to
my
creator
with
ragged
coat
wrapped
about
my
form
i
faced
the
breeze
and
strode
onward
towards
the
home
of
the
gelid
wind
that
now
dashed
in
gusts
against
my
person
then
i
heard
my
footstep
crunch
and
perceived
that
the
sand
was
hard
beneath
my
feet
i
stooped
over
to
examine
it
and
found
it
frozen
strange
i
reflected
strange
that
dry
sand
can
freeze
and
then
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
spurts
of
snow
surrounded
me
was
a
sleety
mixture
upon
which
i
trod
a
crust
of
snow
and
sand
a
sense
of
dread
came
suddenly
over
me
and
instinctively
i
turned
affrighted
and
ran
away
from
the
wind
towards
the
desert
behind
me
back
towards
the
sun
which
cold
and
bleak
low
in
the
horizon
was
sinking
the
sense
of
dread
grew
upon
me
and
i
shivered
as
i
ran
with
my
back
towards
the
breeze
i
had
blessed
i
now
fled
towards
the
sinking
sun
i
had
cursed
i
stretched
out
my
arms
in
supplication
towards
that
orb
for
from
behind
overhanging
blackness
spread
and
about
me
roared
a
fearful
hurricane
vainly
as
i
thought
in
mockery
the
heartless
sun
disappeared
before
my
gaze
the
hurricane
surrounded
me
and
the
wind
about
me
became
intensely
cold
and
raved
furiously
it
seemed
as
though
the
sun
had
fled
from
my
presence
and
with
the
disappearance
of
that
orb
the
outline
of
the
earth
was
blotted
from
existence
it
was
an
awful
blackness
and
the
universe
was
now
to
me
a
blank
the
cold
strengthened
and
froze
my
body
to
the
marrow
of
my
bones
first
came
the
sting
of
frost
then
the
pain
of
cold
then
insensibility
of
flesh
my
feet
were
benumbed
my
limbs
motionless
i
stood
a
statue
quiescent
in
the
midst
of
the
roaring
tempest
the
earth
the
sun
the
heavens
themselves
my
very
person
now
had
disappeared
dead
to
the
sense
of
pain
or
touch
sightless
amid
a
blank
only
the
noise
of
the
raging
winds
was
to
me
a
reality
and
as
the
creaking
frost
reached
my
brain
and
congealed
it
the
sound
of
the
tempest
ceased
and
then
devoid
of
physical
senses
my
quickened
intellect
enslaved
remained
imprisoned
in
the
frozen
form
it
could
not
leave
and
yet
could
no
longer
control
reflection
after
reflection
passed
through
that
incarcerated
thought
entity
and
as
i
meditated
the
heinous
mistakes
i
had
committed
in
the
life
that
had
passed
arose
to
torment
god
had
answered
my
supplications
successively
i
had
experienced
the
hollowness
of
earthly
pleasures
and
had
left
each
lesson
unheeded
had
i
not
alternately
begged
for
and
then
cursed
each
gift
of
god
had
i
not
prayed
for
heat
cold
light
and
darkness
and
anathematized
each
had
i
not
when
in
perfect
silence
prayed
for
sound
in
sheltered
caverns
prayed
for
winds
and
storms
in
the
very
corridors
of
heaven
and
in
the
presence
of
etidorhpa
had
i
not
sought
for
joys
beyond
had
i
not
found
each
pleasure
of
life
a
mockery
and
notwithstanding
each
bitter
lesson
still
pursued
my
headstrong
course
alternately
blessing
and
cursing
my
creator
and
then
myself
until
now
amid
a
howling
waste
in
perfect
darkness
my
conscious
intellect
was
bound
to
the
frozen
rigid
semblance
of
a
body
all
about
me
was
dead
and
dark
all
within
was
still
and
cold
only
my
quickened
intellect
remained
as
in
every
corpse
the
intellect
must
remain
while
the
body
has
a
mortal
form
for
death
of
body
is
not
attended
by
the
immediate
liberation
of
mind
the
consciousness
of
the
dead
man
is
still
acute
and
he
who
thinks
the
dead
are
mindless
will
realize
his
fearful
error
when
devoid
of
motion
he
lies
a
corpse
conscious
of
all
that
passes
on
around
him
waiting
the
liberation
that
can
only
come
by
disintegration
and
destruction
of
the
flesh
so
unconscious
of
pain
unconscious
of
any
physical
sense
i
existed
on
and
on
enthralled
age
after
age
passed
and
piled
upon
one
another
for
time
was
to
me
unchangeable
no
more
an
entity
i
now
prayed
for
change
of
any
kind
and
envied
the
very
devils
in
hell
their
pleasures
for
were
they
not
gifted
with
the
power
of
motion
could
they
not
hear
and
see
and
realize
the
pains
they
suffered
i
prayed
for
death
death
absolute
death
eternal
then
at
last
the
darkness
seemed
to
lessen
and
i
saw
the
frozen
earth
beneath
the
monstrous
crags
of
ice
above
the
raging
tempest
about
for
i
now
had
learned
by
reflection
to
perceive
by
pure
intellect
to
see
by
the
light
within
my
body
solid
as
stone
was
fixed
and
preserved
in
a
waste
of
ice
the
world
was
frozen
i
perceived
that
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
nearly
stilled
dim
and
motionless
had
paled
in
the
cold
depths
of
space
the
universe
itself
was
freezing
and
amid
the
desolation
only
my
deserted
intellect
remained
age
after
age
had
passed
æons
of
ages
had
fled
nation
after
nation
had
grown
and
perished
and
in
the
uncounted
epochs
behind
humanity
had
disappeared
unable
to
free
itself
from
the
frozen
body
my
own
intellect
remained
the
solitary
spectator
of
the
dead
silence
about
at
last
beneath
my
vision
the
moon
disappeared
the
stars
faded
one
by
one
and
then
i
watched
the
sun
grow
dim
until
at
length
only
a
milky
film
remained
to
indicate
her
face
and
then
vacancy
i
had
lived
the
universe
away
and
in
perfect
darkness
the
living
intellect
conscious
of
all
that
had
transpired
in
the
ages
past
clung
still
enthralled
to
the
body
of
the
frozen
mortal
i
thought
of
my
record
in
the
distant
past
of
the
temptations
i
had
undergone
and
called
myself
a
fool
for
had
i
listened
to
the
tempter
i
could
at
least
have
suffered
i
could
have
had
companionship
even
though
it
were
of
the
devils
in
hell
i
lived
my
life
over
and
over
times
without
number
i
thought
of
my
tempters
of
the
offered
cups
and
thinking
argued
with
myself
no
i
said
no
i
had
made
the
promise
i
have
faith
in
etidorhpa
and
were
it
to
do
over
again
i
would
not
drink
then
as
this
thought
sped
from
me
the
ice
scene
dissolved
the
enveloped
frozen
form
of
myself
faded
from
view
the
sand
shrunk
into
nothingness
and
with
my
natural
body
and
in
normal
condition
i
found
myself
back
in
the
earth
cavern
on
my
knees
beside
the
curious
inverted
fungus
of
which
fruit
i
had
eaten
in
obedience
to
my
directions
before
me
the
familiar
figure
of
my
guide
stood
with
folded
arms
and
as
my
gaze
fell
upon
him
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
raised
me
to
my
feet
where
have
you
been
during
the
wretched
epochs
that
have
passed
since
i
last
saw
you
i
asked
i
have
been
here
he
replied
and
you
have
been
there
you
lie
you
villainous
sorcerer
i
cried
you
lie
again
as
you
have
lied
to
me
before
i
followed
you
to
the
edge
of
demon
land
to
the
caverns
of
the
drunkards
and
then
you
deserted
me
since
last
we
met
i
have
spent
a
million
billion
years
of
agony
inexpressible
and
have
had
that
agony
made
doubly
horrible
by
contrast
with
the
thought
yes
the
very
sight
and
touch
of
heaven
i
passed
into
a
double
eternity
and
have
experienced
the
ecstacies
of
the
blessed
and
suffered
the
torments
of
the
damned
and
now
you
dare
boldly
tell
me
that
i
have
been
here
and
that
you
have
been
there
since
last
i
saw
you
stand
by
this
cursed
fungus
bowl
yes
he
said
taking
no
offense
at
my
violence
yes
neither
of
us
has
left
this
spot
you
have
sipped
of
the
drink
of
an
drunkard
you
have
experienced
part
of
the
curses
of
intemperance
the
delirium
of
narcotics
thousands
of
men
on
earth
in
their
drunken
hallucination
have
gone
through
hotter
hells
than
you
have
seen
your
dream
has
not
exaggerated
the
sufferings
of
those
who
sup
of
the
delirium
of
intemperance
and
then
he
continued
let
me
tell
you
of
man
conception
of
eternity
chapter
xlii
eternity
without
time
man
conception
of
eternity
is
that
of
infinite
duration
continuance
without
beginning
or
end
and
yet
everything
he
knows
is
bounded
by
two
or
more
opposites
from
a
beginning
as
he
sees
a
form
of
matter
that
substance
passes
to
an
end
thus
spoke
my
guide
then
he
asked
and
showed
by
his
question
that
he
appreciated
the
nature
of
my
recent
experiences
do
you
recall
the
instant
that
you
left
me
standing
by
this
bowl
to
start
as
you
imagined
with
me
as
a
companion
on
the
journey
to
the
cavern
of
the
grotesque
no
because
i
did
not
leave
you
i
sipped
of
the
liquid
and
then
you
moved
on
with
me
from
this
spot
we
were
together
until
at
last
we
were
separated
on
the
edge
of
the
cave
of
drunkards
listen
said
he
i
neither
left
you
nor
went
with
you
you
neither
went
from
this
spot
nor
came
back
again
you
neither
saw
nor
experienced
my
presence
nor
my
absence
there
was
no
beginning
to
your
journey
go
on
you
ate
of
the
narcotic
fungus
you
have
been
intoxicated
i
have
not
i
retorted
i
have
been
through
your
accursed
caverns
and
into
hell
beyond
i
have
been
consumed
by
eternal
damnation
in
the
journey
have
experienced
a
heaven
of
delight
and
also
an
eternity
of
misery
upon
the
contrary
the
time
that
has
passed
since
you
drank
the
liquid
contents
of
that
fungus
fruit
has
only
been
that
which
permitted
you
to
fall
upon
your
knees
you
swallowed
the
liquor
when
i
handed
you
the
shell
cup
you
dropped
upon
your
knees
and
then
instantly
awoke
see
he
said
in
corroboration
of
my
assertion
the
shell
of
the
fungus
fruit
at
your
feet
is
still
dripping
with
the
liquid
you
did
not
drink
time
has
been
annihilated
under
the
influence
of
this
potent
your
dream
begun
inside
of
eternity
you
did
not
pass
into
it
you
say
i
interrupted
that
i
dropped
upon
my
knees
that
i
have
experienced
the
hallucination
of
intoxication
that
the
experiences
of
my
vision
occurred
during
the
second
of
time
that
was
required
for
me
to
drop
upon
my
knees
yes
then
by
your
own
argument
you
demonstrate
that
eternity
requires
time
for
even
a
millionth
part
of
a
second
is
time
as
much
so
as
a
million
of
years
you
mistake
he
replied
you
misinterpret
my
words
i
said
that
all
you
experienced
in
your
eternity
of
suffering
and
pleasure
occurred
between
the
point
when
you
touched
the
fungus
fruit
to
your
lips
and
that
when
your
knees
struck
the
stone
that
consumed
time
i
answered
did
i
assert
he
questioned
that
your
experiences
were
scattered
over
that
entire
period
no
may
not
all
that
occurred
to
your
mind
have
been
crushed
into
the
second
that
accompanied
the
mental
impression
produced
by
the
liquor
or
the
second
of
time
that
followed
or
any
other
part
of
that
period
or
a
fraction
of
any
integral
second
of
that
period
i
can
not
say
i
answered
what
part
of
the
period
the
hallucination
as
you
call
it
occupied
you
admit
that
so
far
as
your
conception
of
time
is
concerned
the
occurrences
to
which
you
refer
may
have
existed
in
either
an
inestimable
fraction
of
the
first
the
second
or
the
third
part
of
the
period
yes
i
replied
yes
if
you
are
correct
in
that
they
were
illusions
let
me
ask
you
furthermore
he
said
are
you
sure
that
the
flash
that
bred
your
hallucination
was
not
instantaneous
and
a
part
of
neither
the
first
second
nor
third
second
continue
your
argument
i
will
repeat
a
preceding
question
with
a
slight
modification
may
not
all
that
occurred
to
your
mind
have
been
crushed
into
the
space
between
the
second
of
time
that
preceded
the
mental
impression
produced
by
the
liquor
and
the
second
that
followed
it
need
it
have
been
a
part
of
either
second
or
of
time
at
all
indeed
could
it
have
been
a
part
of
time
if
it
were
instantaneous
go
on
suppose
the
entity
that
men
call
the
soul
of
man
were
in
process
of
separation
from
the
body
the
process
you
will
admit
would
occupy
time
until
the
point
of
liberation
was
reached
would
not
dissolution
so
far
as
the
separation
of
matter
and
spirit
is
concerned
at
its
critical
point
be
instantaneous
i
made
no
reply
if
the
critical
point
is
instantaneous
there
would
be
no
beginning
there
could
be
no
end
therein
rests
an
eternity
greater
than
man
can
otherwise
conceive
of
for
as
there
is
neither
beginning
nor
end
time
and
space
are
annihilated
the
line
that
separates
the
soul
that
is
in
the
body
from
the
soul
that
is
out
of
the
body
is
outside
of
all
things
it
is
a
between
neither
a
part
of
the
nether
side
nor
of
the
upper
side
it
is
outside
the
here
and
the
hereafter
let
us
carry
this
thought
a
little
further
said
he
suppose
a
good
man
were
to
undergo
this
change
could
not
all
that
an
eternity
of
happiness
might
offer
be
crushed
into
this
boundless
conception
the
critical
point
all
that
a
mother
craves
in
children
dead
could
reappear
again
in
their
once
loved
forms
all
that
a
good
life
earns
would
rest
in
the
soul
experience
in
that
eternity
but
not
as
an
illusion
although
no
mental
pleasure
no
physical
pain
is
equal
to
that
of
hallucinations
suppose
that
a
vicious
life
were
ended
could
it
escape
the
inevitable
critical
point
would
not
that
life
in
its
previous
journey
create
its
own
sad
eternity
you
have
seen
the
working
of
an
eternity
with
an
end
but
not
a
beginning
to
it
for
you
can
not
sense
the
commencement
of
your
vision
you
have
been
in
the
cavern
of
the
grotesque
the
realms
of
the
beautiful
and
have
walked
over
the
boundless
sands
that
bring
misery
to
the
soul
and
have
as
a
statue
seen
the
frozen
universe
dissolve
you
are
thankful
that
it
was
all
an
illusion
as
you
deem
it
now
what
would
you
think
had
only
the
heavenly
part
been
spread
before
you
i
would
have
cursed
the
man
who
dispelled
the
illusion
i
answered
then
he
said
you
are
willing
to
admit
that
men
who
so
live
as
to
gain
such
an
eternity
be
it
mental
illusion
hallucination
or
real
make
no
mistake
in
life
i
do
i
replied
but
you
confound
me
when
you
argue
in
so
cool
a
manner
that
eternity
may
be
everlasting
to
the
soul
and
yet
without
the
conception
of
time
did
i
not
teach
you
in
the
beginning
of
this
journey
he
interjected
that
time
is
not
as
men
conceive
it
men
can
not
grasp
an
idea
of
eternity
and
retain
their
sun
bred
morning
and
evening
conception
of
time
therein
lies
their
error
as
the
tip
of
the
passes
with
the
lash
so
through
life
the
soul
of
man
proceeds
with
the
body
as
there
is
a
point
just
when
the
tip
of
the
is
on
the
edge
of
its
return
where
all
motion
of
the
line
that
bounds
the
tip
ends
so
there
is
a
motionless
point
when
the
soul
starts
onward
from
the
body
of
man
as
the
tip
of
the
sends
its
cry
through
space
not
while
it
is
in
motion
either
way
but
from
the
point
where
motion
ceases
the
spaceless
timeless
point
that
lies
between
the
backward
and
the
forward
so
the
soul
of
man
leaves
a
cry
eternity
at
the
critical
point
it
is
the
death
echo
and
thus
each
snap
of
the
throws
an
eternity
its
own
eternity
into
eternity
seas
and
each
eternity
is
made
up
of
the
entities
thus
cast
from
the
critical
point
with
the
end
of
each
soul
earth
journey
a
new
eternity
springs
into
existence
occupying
no
space
consuming
no
time
and
not
conflicting
with
any
other
each
being
exactly
what
the
record
makes
it
an
eternity
of
joy
heaven
or
an
eternity
of
anguish
hell
there
can
be
no
neutral
ground
then
he
continued
the
drunkard
is
destined
to
suffer
in
the
drunkard
eternity
as
you
have
suffered
the
enticement
of
drink
is
evanescent
the
agony
to
follow
is
eternal
you
have
seen
that
the
of
earth
supply
an
intoxicant
taste
not
again
of
any
intoxicant
let
your
recent
lesson
be
your
last
any
stimulant
is
an
enemy
to
man
any
narcotic
is
a
fiend
it
destroys
its
victim
and
corrupts
the
mind
entices
it
into
pastures
grotesque
and
even
pleasant
at
first
but
destined
to
eternal
misery
in
the
end
beware
of
the
eternity
that
follows
the
snapping
of
the
of
a
drunkard
come
he
abruptly
said
we
will
pursue
our
journey
morphine
belladonna
hyoscyamus
and
cannabis
indica
are
narcotics
and
yet
each
differs
in
its
action
from
the
others
alcohol
and
methyl
alcohol
are
intoxicants
ether
chloroform
and
chloral
are
anæsthetics
and
yet
no
two
are
possessed
of
the
same
qualities
is
there
any
good
reason
to
doubt
that
combinations
of
the
elements
as
yet
hidden
from
man
can
not
cause
hallucinations
that
combine
and
intensify
the
most
virulent
of
narcotics
intoxicants
and
anæsthetics
and
pall
the
effects
of
hashish
or
of
opium
if
in
the
course
of
experimentation
a
chemist
should
strike
upon
a
compound
that
in
traces
only
would
subject
his
mind
and
drive
his
pen
to
record
such
seemingly
extravagant
ideas
as
are
found
in
the
hallucinations
herein
pictured
would
it
not
be
his
duty
to
bury
the
discovery
from
others
to
cover
from
mankind
the
existence
of
such
a
noxious
fruit
of
the
chemist
or
pharmaceutist
art
introduce
such
an
intoxicant
and
start
it
to
ferment
in
humanity
blood
and
before
the
world
were
advised
of
its
possible
results
might
not
the
ever
increasing
potency
gain
such
headway
as
to
destroy
or
debase
our
civilization
and
even
to
exterminate
mankind
j
interlude
chapter
xliii
the
last
contest
i
lewellyn
drury
had
been
so
absorbed
in
the
fantastic
story
the
old
man
read
so
fluently
from
the
execrably
written
manuscript
and
in
the
metaphysical
argument
which
followed
his
account
of
the
vision
he
had
introduced
so
artfully
as
to
lead
me
to
think
it
was
a
part
of
his
narrative
that
i
scarcely
noted
the
passage
of
time
upon
seeing
him
suspend
his
reading
fold
the
manuscript
and
place
it
in
his
pocket
i
reverted
to
material
things
and
glancing
at
the
clock
perceived
that
the
hands
pointed
to
evening
said
he
i
will
return
at
nine
in
the
interim
if
you
still
question
any
part
of
the
story
or
wish
further
information
on
any
subject
connected
with
my
journey
i
will
be
prepared
to
answer
your
queries
since
however
that
will
be
your
last
opportunity
i
suggest
that
you
make
notes
of
all
subjects
that
you
wish
to
discuss
then
in
his
usual
exquisitely
polite
manner
he
bowed
himself
out
i
spent
the
next
day
reviewing
the
most
questionable
features
of
his
history
recalling
the
several
statements
that
had
been
made
remembering
the
humiliation
i
had
experienced
in
my
previous
attempts
to
confute
him
i
determined
to
select
such
subjects
as
would
appear
the
most
difficult
to
explain
and
to
attack
the
old
man
with
vehemence
i
confess
that
notwithstanding
my
several
failures
and
his
successful
and
constant
elucidation
and
minute
details
in
regard
to
occurrences
which
he
related
and
which
anticipated
many
points
i
had
once
had
in
mind
to
question
misgivings
still
possessed
me
concerning
the
truthfulness
of
the
story
if
these
remarkable
episodes
were
true
could
there
be
such
a
thing
as
fiction
if
not
all
true
where
did
fact
end
and
fancy
begin
accordingly
i
devoted
the
following
day
to
meditating
my
plan
of
attack
for
i
felt
that
i
had
been
challenged
to
a
final
contest
late
the
next
day
i
felt
confident
of
my
own
ability
to
dispossess
him
and
in
order
further
to
test
his
power
when
night
came
i
doubly
locked
the
door
to
my
room
first
with
the
key
and
next
with
the
inside
bolt
i
had
determined
to
force
him
again
to
induce
inert
material
to
obey
his
command
as
he
had
done
at
our
first
interview
the
reader
will
remember
that
chickering
had
deemed
that
occurrence
an
illusion
and
i
confess
that
time
had
dimmed
the
vividness
of
the
scene
in
my
own
mind
hence
i
proposed
to
verify
the
matter
therefore
at
the
approach
of
nine
the
evening
following
i
sat
with
my
gaze
riveted
on
the
bolt
of
the
door
determined
not
to
answer
his
knock
he
gave
me
no
chance
to
neglect
a
response
to
his
rap
exactly
at
the
stroke
of
nine
the
door
swung
noiselessly
on
its
hinges
the
wizard
entered
and
the
door
closed
again
the
bolt
had
not
moved
the
knob
did
not
turn
the
bar
passed
through
the
catch
and
back
to
its
seat
i
sprung
from
my
chair
and
excitedly
and
rudely
rushed
past
my
guest
i
grasped
the
knob
wrenched
it
with
all
my
might
vainly
the
door
was
locked
the
bolt
was
fastened
then
i
turned
to
my
visitor
he
was
quietly
seated
in
his
accustomed
place
and
apparently
failed
to
notice
my
discomposure
although
he
must
have
realized
that
he
had
withstood
my
first
test
this
pronounced
defeat
at
the
very
beginning
of
our
proposed
contest
produced
a
depressing
effect
nevertheless
i
made
an
effort
at
and
seating
myself
opposite
looked
my
antagonist
in
the
face
calm
dignified
with
the
brow
of
a
philosopher
and
the
countenance
of
a
philanthropist
a
perfect
type
of
the
exquisite
gentleman
and
the
cultured
scholar
my
guest
as
serene
and
complacent
as
though
instead
of
an
intruder
he
were
an
invited
participant
of
the
comforts
of
my
fireside
or
even
the
host
himself
laid
his
hat
upon
the
table
stroked
his
silvery
translucent
beard
and
said
well
i
accepted
the
challenge
for
the
word
as
he
emphasized
it
was
a
challenge
and
hurled
at
him
in
hopes
to
catch
him
unprepared
the
following
abrupt
sentence
i
doubt
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
a
great
cavern
such
as
you
have
described
the
superincumbent
mass
of
earth
would
crush
the
strongest
metal
no
material
known
to
man
could
withstand
a
pressure
so
great
as
would
overlie
an
arch
as
large
as
that
you
depict
material
would
succumb
even
if
the
roof
were
made
of
steel
do
not
be
so
positive
he
replied
by
what
authority
do
you
make
this
assertion
by
the
authority
of
common
sense
as
opposed
to
an
unreasonable
hypothesis
you
should
know
that
there
is
a
limit
to
the
strength
of
all
things
and
that
no
substance
is
capable
of
making
an
arch
of
thousands
of
miles
which
according
to
your
assertion
must
have
been
the
diameter
of
the
roof
of
your
inland
sea
ah
he
replied
and
so
you
again
crush
my
facts
with
your
theory
well
let
me
ask
a
question
proceed
did
you
ever
observe
a
bubble
resting
on
a
bubble
yes
did
you
ever
place
a
in
a
partly
filled
bowl
of
soap
water
and
by
blowing
through
it
fill
the
bowl
with
bubbles
yes
did
you
ever
calculate
the
tensile
strength
of
the
material
from
which
you
blew
the
bubble
no
for
soap
water
has
no
appreciable
strength
and
yet
you
know
that
a
bubble
made
of
suds
has
not
only
strength
but
elasticity
suppose
a
bubble
of
energy
floating
in
space
were
to
be
covered
to
the
depth
of
the
thickness
of
a
sheet
of
tissue
paper
with
the
dust
of
space
would
that
surprise
you
no
suppose
two
such
globes
of
energy
covered
with
dust
were
to
be
telescoped
or
attached
together
would
you
marvel
at
the
fact
no
he
drew
a
picture
on
a
piece
of
paper
in
which
one
line
was
inclosed
by
another
and
remarked
the
pencil
mark
on
this
paper
is
proportionately
thicker
than
the
crust
of
the
earth
over
the
earth
cavern
i
have
described
even
if
it
were
made
of
soap
suds
it
could
revolve
through
space
and
maintain
its
contour
but
the
earth
is
a
globe
i
interjected
you
do
not
mean
an
exact
globe
no
it
is
flattened
at
the
poles
he
took
from
his
pocket
two
thin
rubber
balls
one
slightly
larger
than
the
other
with
his
knife
he
divided
the
larger
ball
cutting
it
into
halves
he
then
placed
one
of
the
sections
upon
the
perfect
ball
and
held
the
arrangement
between
the
gas
light
and
the
wall
illustration
fig
a
a
telescoped
energy
spheres
see
is
not
the
shadow
flattened
as
your
earth
is
at
the
poles
yes
but
the
earth
is
not
a
shadow
we
will
not
argue
that
point
now
he
replied
and
then
asked
suppose
such
a
compound
shell
as
this
were
to
revolve
through
space
and
continuously
collect
dust
most
of
it
of
the
earth
temperature
forming
a
fluid
water
would
not
that
dust
be
propelled
naturally
from
the
poles
yes
according
to
our
theory
perhaps
said
he
the
contact
edge
of
the
invisible
spheres
of
energy
which
compose
your
earth
bubbles
for
planets
are
bubbles
that
have
been
covered
with
water
and
soil
during
the
time
the
energy
bubble
which
is
the
real
bone
of
the
globe
has
been
revolving
through
space
perhaps
could
you
reach
the
foundation
of
the
earth
dust
you
would
find
it
not
a
perfect
sphere
but
a
compound
skeleton
as
of
two
bubbles
locked
or
rather
telescoped
together
see
fig
are
you
sure
that
my
guide
did
not
lead
me
through
the
space
between
the
bubbles
then
he
continued
do
not
be
shocked
at
what
i
am
about
to
assert
for
as
a
member
of
materialistic
humanity
you
will
surely
consider
me
irrational
when
i
say
that
matter
materials
ponderous
substances
one
and
all
so
far
as
the
ponderous
part
is
concerned
have
no
strength
what
no
strength
none
whatever
i
grasped
the
poker
is
not
this
matter
yes
i
can
not
break
it
no
have
not
i
strength
confine
your
argument
now
to
the
poker
we
will
consider
you
next
you
can
not
break
it
i
can
break
this
pencil
though
and
i
snapped
it
in
his
face
yes
i
curled
my
lip
in
disdain
you
carry
this
argument
too
far
why
i
can
break
the
pencil
i
can
not
break
the
poker
had
these
materials
not
different
strengths
there
could
be
no
distinction
had
i
no
strength
i
could
not
have
broken
either
are
you
ready
to
listen
he
replied
yes
but
do
not
exasperate
me
i
did
not
say
that
the
combination
you
call
a
poker
had
no
strength
neither
did
i
assert
that
you
could
not
break
a
pencil
a
distinction
without
a
difference
you
play
upon
words
i
said
that
matter
the
ponderous
side
of
material
substances
has
no
strength
and
i
say
differently
he
thrust
the
end
of
the
poker
into
the
fire
and
soon
drew
it
forth
is
it
as
strong
as
before
no
heat
it
to
whiteness
and
it
becomes
plastic

is
it
the

is

that
qualifies
the

of
the

it
seems
to
me
that
were
i
in
your
place
i
would
now
argue
that
absence
of
heat
constitutes
strength
he
sarcastically
continued
go
on
cool
this
poker
by
thrusting
it
into
a
pail
of
cold
water
and
it
becomes
very
hard

yes
cool

it

in

my
question
i
can
not
why
does
brittle
cold
zinc
when
heated
become
first
ductile
and
then
at
an
increased
temperature
become
brittle
again
in
each
case
the
same

is
present
i
do
not
know
but
this
i
do
know
i
am
an
organized
being
and
i
have
strength
of
body
the
old
man
grasped
the
heavy
iron
poker
with
both
hands
and
suddenly
rising
to
his
full
height
swung
it
about
his
head
then
with
a
motion
so
menacing
that
i
shrunk
back
into
my
chair
and
cried
out
in
alarm
seemed
about
to
strike
with
full
force
my
defenseless
brow
my
god
i
shouted
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
murder
me
he
lowered
the
weapon
and
calmly
asked
suppose
that
i
had
crushed
your
skull
where
then
would
be
your
vaunted
strength
i
made
no
reply
for
as
yet
i
had
not
recovered
from
the
mental
shock
could
you
then
have
snapped
a
pencil
could
you
have
broken
a
reed
could
you
even
have
blown
the
down
from
a
thistle
bloom
no
would
not
your
material
body
have
been
intact
yes
listen
said
he
matter
has
no
strength
matter
obeys
spirit
and
spirit
dominates
all
things
material
energy
in
some
form
holds
particles
of
matter
together
and
energy
in
other
forms
loosens
them
is
this
imponderable
force
that
gives
strength
to
substances
not
the
ponderable
side
of
the
material
granite
crushed
is
still
granite
but
destitute
of
rigidity
creatures
dead
are
still
organic
structures
but
devoid
of
strength
or
motion
the
spirit
that
pervades
all
material
things
gives
to
them
form
and
existence
take
from
your
earth
its
vital
spirit
the
energy
that
subjects
matter
and
your
adamantine
rocks
would
disintegrate
and
sift
as
dust
into
the
interstices
of
space
your
rigid
globe
a
shell
of
space
dust
would
dissolve
collapse
and
as
the
spray
of
a
burst
bubble
its
ponderous
side
would
vanish
in
the
depths
of
force
i
sat
motionless
listen
he
repeated
you
wrong
your
own
common
sense
when
you
place
dead
matter
above
the
spirit
of
matter
atoms
come
and
go
in
their
ceaseless
transmigrations
worlds
move
universes
circulate
not
because
they
are
material
bodies
but
because
as
points
of
matter
in
a
flood
of
force
they
obey
the
spirit
that
can
blot
out
a
sun
or
dissolve
the
earth
as
easily
as
it
can
unlink
two
atoms
matter
is
an
illusion
spirit
is
the
reality
i
felt
that
he
had
silenced
me
against
my
will
and
although
i
could
not
gainsay
his
assertions
i
determined
to
study
the
subject
carefully
at
my
leisure
as
you
please
he
interjected
into
my
musings
but
since
you
are
so
determined
you
would
better
study
from
books
that
are
written
by
authors
who
know
whereof
they
write
and
who
are
not
obliged
to
theorize
from
speculative
data
concerning
the
intrastructural
earth
crust
but
where
can
i
find
such
works
i
do
not
know
of
any
then
said
he
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
cease
doubting
the
word
of
one
who
has
acquired
the
knowledge
to
write
such
a
book
and
who
has
no
object
in
misleading
you
still
other
questions
arise
i
said
well
i
consider
the
account
of
the
fungus
intoxicant
beyond
the
realm
of
fact
in
what
respect
the
perfect
loss
of
self
that
resulted
immediately
in
an
instant
after
swallowing
the
juice
of
the
fungous
fruit
so
that
you
could
not
distinguish
between
the
real
guide
at
your
side
and
the
phantom
that
sprung
into
existence
is
incredible
see
p
an
element
of
time
is
a
factor
in
the
operation
of
nerve
impressions
it
is
well
that
reference
was
made
to
this
point
few
readers
would
probably
notice
that
chapter
xxxvi
begun
a
narcotic
j
have
you
investigated
all
possible
anæsthetics
he
asked
of
course
not
or
all
possible
narcotics
no
how
long
does
it
require
for
pure
prussic
acid
to
produce
its
physiological
action
i
do
not
know
he
ignored
my
reply
and
continued
since
there
exists
a
relative
difference
between
the
time
that
is
required
for
ether
and
chloroform
to
produce
insensibility
and
between
the
actions
and
resultant
effects
of
all
known
anæsthetics
intoxicants
and
narcotics
i
think
you
are
hypercritical
some
nerve
excitants
known
to
you
act
slowly
others
quickly
why
not
others
still
instantaneously
if
you
can
rest
your
assertion
on
any
good
basis
i
will
gladly
meet
your
questions
but
i
do
not
accept
such
evidence
as
you
now
introduce
and
i
do
not
care
to
argue
for
both
parties
again
i
was
becoming
irritated
for
i
was
not
satisfied
with
the
manner
in
which
i
upheld
my
part
of
the
argument
and
naturally
as
is
usually
the
case
with
the
defeated
party
became
incensed
at
my
invincible
antagonist
well
i
said
i
criticise
your
credulity
the
drunkards
of
the
drunkards
cavern
were
beyond
all
credence
i
can
not
conceive
of
such
abnormal
creations
even
in
illusion
had
i
met
with
your
experiences
i
would
not
have
supposed
for
an
instant
that
the
fantastic
shapes
could
have
been
aught
but
a
dream
or
the
result
of
hallucination
while
without
a
question
you
considered
them
real
you
are
certainly
pressed
for
subjects
about
which
to
complain
when
you
resort
to
criticising
the
possibilities
in
creations
of
a
mind
under
the
influence
of
a
more
powerful
intoxicant
than
is
known
to
surface
earth
he
remarked
however
i
will
show
you
that
nature
fashions
animals
in
forms
more
fantastic
than
i
saw
and
that
even
these
figures
were
not
overdrawn
without
heeding
his
remark
i
interrupted
his
discourse
determined
to
have
my
say
and
i
furthermore
question
the
uncouth
personage
you
describe
as
your
guide
would
you
have
me
believe
that
such
a
being
has
an
existence
outside
an
abnormal
ah
he
replied
you
have
done
well
to
ask
these
two
questions
in
succession
for
you
permit
me
to
answer
both
at
once
listen
the
monkey
of
all
animals
seems
to
approach
closest
to
man
in
figure
the
siamang
gibon
of
asia
the
saki
of
south
america
with
its
stub
of
a
tail
being
nearest
from
these
types
we
have
great
deviations
as
in
the
wanderer
of
india
with
its
whiskered
face
and
the
black
macaque
of
the
island
of
celebes
with
its
hairy
topknot
and
hairless
stub
of
a
tail
or
the
squirrel
monkey
with
its
long
supple
tail
and
the
thumbless
spider
monkey
of
south
america
between
these
types
we
have
among
monkeys
nearly
every
conceivable
shape
of
limb
and
figure
and
in
color
of
their
faces
and
bodies
all
the
shades
of
the
rainbow

squirrels

and
then
sail
through

no
teeth
at
all
while
the
grizzly
bear
can
crush
a

barrel
with
its

the
platypus
of
south
australia
has
the
body
of
a
mole
the
tail
of

bill
of
a
duck
and
the

of
a
seal
combined
with
the
feet
of
a
rat
it
lays
eggs
as
birds
do
but
suckles
its
young
as
do
other
mammalia
the
opossum
has
a
prehensile
tail
as
have
some
monkeys
and
in
addition
a
living
bag
or
pouch
in
which
the
female
carries
her
tiny
young
the
young
of
a
kind
of

three
species
of
frogs
and
toads

its
tip
to

end
of

and
is
free
behind
the
ordinary
bullfrog
has
conspicuous
great
legs
while
a
relative
the
coecilia
and
others
as
well
have
a
head
reminding
of
the
frog
but
neither
tail
nor
legs
the
body
being
elongated
as
if
it
were
a
worm
the
long
slender
fingers
of
a
bat
are
united
by
means
of
a
membrane
that
enables
it
to
fly
like
a
bird
while
as
a
contrast
the
fingers
of
a
mole
its
near
cousin
are
short
and
stubby
and
massive
as
compared
with
its
frame
the
former
flies
through
the
air
the
latter
burrows
almost
flies
through
the
earth
the

has
a
curved
head
which
is
drawn
out
into
a
slender
snout
no
teeth
a
long
slender
tongue
a
great
bushy
tail
and
claws
that
neither
allow
the
creature
to
burrow
in
the
earth
nor
climb
into
trees
but
which
are
admirably
adapted
to
tear
an
into
fragments
its
close
relatives
the
apar
and
armadillo
have
a
round
body
covered
with
bony
plates
and
a
short
horny
curved
tail
while
another
relative
the
pangolin
has
a
great
tail
which
together
with
its
body
is
covered
with
horny
overlapping
scales
the
greenland
whale
has
an
enormous
head
occupying
more
than
its
length
no
teeth
and
a
throat
scarcely
larger
than
that
of
a
sucker
fish
the
golden
mole
has
a
body
so
nearly
symmetrical
that
were
it
not
for
the
snout
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
the
location
of
the
head
without
close
inspection
and
it
has
legs
so
short
that
were
it
not
for
the
powerful
claws
they
would
not
be
observed
at
all
the
narwhal
has
a
straight
twisted
tusk
a
hold
hold
i
interrupted
do
you
think
that
i
am
concerned
in
these
well
known
contrasts
in
animal
structure
did
you
not
question
the
possibility
of
the
description
i
gave
of
my
grotesque
drunkards
and
of
the
form
of
my
subterranean
guide
my
guest
retorted
yes
but
i
spoke
of
men
you
describe
animals
man
is
an
animal
and
between
the
various
species
of
animals
that
you
say
are
well
known
greater
distinctions
can
be
drawn
than
between
my
guide
and
man
besides
had
you
allowed
me
to
proceed
to
a
description
of
animal
life
beneath
the
surface
of
the
earth
i
would
have
shown
you
that
my
guide
partook
of
their
attributes
of
the
creatures
described
one
only
was
of
the
origin
the
mole
and
like
my
guide
it
is
practically
eyeless
go
on
i
said
is
useless
for
me
to
resist
and
yet
and
yet
what
and
yet
i
have
other
subjects
to
discuss
proceed
i
do
not
like
the
way
in
which
you
constantly
criticise
science
especially
in
referring
thereto
the
responsibilities
of
the
crazed
anatomist
it
seems
to
me
that
he
was
a
monomaniac
gifted
but
crazed
and
that
science
was
unfortunate
in
being
burdened
with
such
an
incubus
this
section
see
was
excised
being
too
j
true
and
yet
science
advances
largely
by
the
work
of
such
apparently
heartless
creatures
were
it
not
for
investigators
who
overstep
the
bounds
of
established
methods
and
thus
criticise
their
predecessors
science
would
rust
and
disintegrate
besides
why
should
not
science
be
judged
by
the
rule
she
applies
to
others
what
do
you
mean
who
is
more
free
to
criticise
religion
than
the
materialistic
man
of
science
but
a
religious
man
is
not
cruel
have
you
not
read
history
have
you
not
shuddered
at
the
crimes
recorded
in
the
name
of
the
religions
of
man
yes
but
these
cruelties
were
committed
by
misguided
men
under
the
cloak
of
the
church
or
of
false
religions
during
the
dark
ages
do
not
blame
religion
but
the
men
who
abused
the
cause
yes
he
added
you
are
right
they
were
fanatics
crazed
beings
men
yes
even
communities
raving
mad
crazed
leaders
can
infuse
the
minds
of
the
people
with
their
fallacies
and
thus
become
leaders
of
crazed
nations
not
as
i
have
depicted
in
my
scientific
enthusiast
one
man
alone
in
the
privacy
of
his
home
torturing
a
single
child
but
whole
nations
pillaging
burning
torturing
and
destroying
but
this
is
foreign
to
our
subject
beware
i
reiterate
of
the
science
of
human
biology
the
man
who
enters
the
field
can
not
foresee
the
end
the
man
who
studies
the
science
of
life
and
records
his
experiments
can
not
know
the
extremes
to
which
a
fanatical
follower
may
carry
the
of
his
leader
i
have
not
overdrawn
the
lesson
besides
science
is
now
really
torturing
burning
maiming
and
destroying
humanity
the
act
of
destruction
has
been
transferred
from
barbarians
and
the
fanatic
in
religion
to
the
follower
of
the
devotees
of
science
no
i
say
no
who
created
the
steam
engine
who
evolves
improved
machinery
who
creates
improved
artillery
and
explosives
scientific
men
he
hesitated
go
on
accumulate
the
maimed
and
destroyed
each
year
add
together
the
miseries
and
sorrows
that
result
from
the
explosions
accidents
and
catastrophes
resulting
from
science
improvements
and
the
dark
ages
scarcely
offer
a
parallel
add
thereto
the
fearful
destruction
that
follows
a
war
among
nations
scientific
and
it
will
be
seen
that
the
scientific
enthusiast
of
the
present
has
taken
the
place
of
the
misguided
fanatic
of
the
past
let
us
be
just
place
to
the
credit
of
religion
the
good
that
religion
has
done
place
to
the
credit
of
science
the
good
that
science
is
doing
and
yet
do
not
mistake
both
leave
in
their
wake
an
atmosphere
saturated
with
misery
a
road
whitened
with
humanity
bones
neither
the
young
nor
the
old
are
spared
and
so
far
as
the
sufferer
is
concerned
it
matters
not
whether
the
person
has
been
racked
by
the
tortures
of
an
inquisition
or
the
sword
of
an
infidel
is
shrieking
in
the
agony
of
a
scald
by
steam
or
is
mangled
by
an
explosion
of
nitroglycerin
again
he
hesitated
go
on
one
of
science
most
serious
responsibilities
from
which
religion
has
nearly
escaped
is
that
of
supplying
to
fanatics
and
from
this
science
can
not
escape
explain
yourself
who
places
the
infidel
in
possession
of
arguments
to
combat
sacred
teachings
who
deliberately
tortures
animals
and
suggests
that
biological
experimentation
in
the
name
of
science
before
cultured
audiences
even
is
legitimate
such
as
making
public
dissections
of
living
creatures
enough
enough
i
cried
thinking
of
his
crazed
anatomist
and
covering
my
face
with
my
hands
you
make
my
blood
creep
yes
he
added
sarcastically
you
shudder
now
and
criticise
my
truthful
study
and
you
will
forget
the
lesson
and
perhaps
for
dinner
you
will
relish
your
dish
of
veal
the
favorite
food
of
mothers
the
nearest
approach
to
the
flesh
of
babies
then
his
manner
changed
and
in
his
usual
mild
pleasant
way
he
said
take
what
i
have
said
kindly
i
wish
only
to
induce
your
religious
part
to
have
more
charity
for
your
scientific
self
and
the
reverse
both
religion
and
science
are
working
towards
the
good
of
man
although
their
devotees
are
human
and
by
human
errors
bring
privations
sufferings
and
sorrows
to
men
neither
can
fill
the
place
of
the
other
each
should
extend
a
helping
hand
and
have
charity
for
the
shortcomings
of
the
other
they
are
not
antagonists
but
workers
in
one
field
both
must
stand
the
criticisms
of
mutual
antagonists
and
both
have
cause
to
fear
the
evils
of
fanaticism
within
their
own
ranks
more
than
the
attacks
of
opponents
from
without
let
the
religious
enthusiast
exercise
care
his
burning
earnest
words
may
lead
a
father
to
murder
an
innocent
family
and
yet
is
not
religion
that
commits
the
crime
let
the
zealous
scientific
man
hesitate
he
piles
up
fuel
by
which
minds
unbalanced
or
dispositions
perverted
seek
to
burn
and
destroy
hopes
that
have
long
served
the
yearnings
of
humanity
soul
neither
pure
religion
nor
true
science
is
to
blame
for
the
acts
of
its
devotees
and
yet
each
must
share
the
responsibility
of
its
human
agents
we
will
discuss
the
subject
no
further
i
said
it
is
not
agreeable
then
i
continued
the
idea
of
eternity
without
time
is
not
quite
clear
to
me
although
i
catch
an
imperfect
conception
of
the
argument
advanced
do
you
mean
to
say
that
when
a
soul
leaves
the
body
the
earth
life
of
the
individual
dominated
by
the
soul
is
thrown
off
from
it
as
is
the
snap
of
a
and
that
into
the
point
between
life
and
death
the
hereafter
of
that
mortal
may
be
concentrated
i
simply
give
you
the
words
of
my
guide
he
replied
but
you
have
expressed
the
idea
about
as
well
as
your
word
language
will
admit
such
a
conception
of
eternity
is
more
rational
to
one
who
like
myself
has
lived
through
an
instant
that
covered
so
far
as
mind
is
concerned
a
million
years
of
time
than
is
an
attempt
to
grasp
a
conception
of
an
eternity
without
beginning
or
end
by
basing
an
argument
on
conditions
governing
material
substances
as
these
substances
are
known
to
man
you
have
the
germ
of
the
idea
which
may
be
simply
a
thought
for
you
to
ponder
over
you
can
study
the
problem
at
your
leisure
do
not
however
i
warn
you
attempt
to
comprehend
the
notion
of
eternity
by
throwing
into
it
the
conception
of
time
as
men
accept
that
term
for
the
very
word
time
as
men
define
it
demands
that
there
be
both
a
beginning
and
an
end
with
the
sense
of
time
in
one
mind
there
can
be
no
conception
of
the
term
eternity
then
as
i
had
so
often
done
before
i
unwarily
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
enlarge
on
his
theme
to
my
disadvantage
i
had
determined
not
to
ask
any
questions
concerning
his
replies
to
my
criticism
for
whenever
i
had
previously
done
so
the
result
had
been
disastrous
to
me
in
this
case
i
unwittingly
said
why
do
you
say
that
our
language
will
not
permit
of
clearer
conceptions
than
you
give
because
your
education
does
not
permit
you
to
think
outside
of
words
you
are
you
astonish
me
by
making
such
an
arrogant
assertion
do
you
mean
to
assert
that
i
can
not
think
without
using
words
yes
every
thought
you
indulge
in
is
circumscribed
you
presumably
attempt
to
throw
a
forward
and
yet
you
step
backward
and
spin
it
in
words
that
have
been
handed
you
from
the
past
and
struggle
as
you
may
you
can
not
liberate
yourself
from
the
dead
incubus
attempt
to
originate
an
idea
and
see
if
you
can
escape
your
go
on
i
am
listening
men
scientific
think
in
language
scientific
men
poetical
think
in
language
poetic
all
educated
men
use
words
in
thinking
of
their
subjects
words
that
came
to
them
from
the
past
and
enslave
their
intellect
thus
it
is
that
the
novelist
can
not
make
fiction
less
real
than
is
fact
that
scientists
can
not
commence
at
the
outside
and
build
a
theory
back
to
phenomena
understood
in
each
case
the
foundation
of
a
thought
is
a
word
that
in
the
very
beginning
carries
to
the
mind
a
meaning
a
something
from
the
past
each
thought
ramification
is
an
offshoot
from
words
that
express
ideas
and
govern
ideas
yes
create
ideas
even
dominating
the
mind
men
speak
of
ideas
when
they
intend
to
refer
to
an
image
in
the
mind
but
in
reality
they
have
no
ideas
outside
of
the
word
sentences
they
unconsciously
reformulate
define
the
term
idea
correctly
and
it
will
be
shown
that
an
idea
is
a
sentence
and
if
a
sentence
is
made
of
words
already
created
there
can
be
no
new
idea
for
every
word
has
a
fixed
meaning
hence
when
men
think
they
only
rearrange
words
that
carry
with
themselves
networks
of
ideas
and
thus
play
upon
their
several
established
meanings
how
can
men
so
circumscribed
construct
a
new
idea
or
teach
a
new
science
new
words
are
being
created
language
is
slowly
progressing
but
no
new
word
adds
itself
to
a
language
it
is
linked
to
that
precede
in
order
to
create
a
word
as
a
rule
roots
are
used
that
are
as
established
in
philology
as
are
building
materials
in
architecture
when
a
new
sound
is
thrust
into
a
language
its
intent
must
be
introduced
by
words
already
known
after
which
it
conveys
a
meaning
derived
from
the
past
and
becomes
a
part
of
mind
sentences
already
constructed
as
it
does
of
spoken
language
language
has
thus
been
painfully
and
slowly
evolved
and
is
still
being
enlarged
but
while
new
impressions
may
be
felt
by
an
educated
person
the
formulated
feeling
is
inseparable
from
surviving
words
some
men
are
dumb
yes
and
yet
they
frame
into
unspoken
words
of
their
own
otherwise
they
would
be
scarcely
more
than
animals
place
an
uneducated
dumb
person
in
a
room
with
a
complicated
instrument
and
although
he
may
comprehend
its
uses
he
can
not
do
so
unless
he
frames
into
what
is
to
him
a
formulated
sequence
but
he
can
think
about
it
no
unless
he
has
already
constructed
previous
impressions
into
of
his
own
he
can
not
think
about
it
at
all
words
whether
spoken
or
unspoken
underlie
all
ideas
try
if
you
believe
i
am
mistaken
try
to
think
of
any
subject
outside
of
words
i
sat
a
moment
and
mentally
attempted
the
task
and
shook
my
head
then
said
the
old
man
how
can
i
use
words
with
established
meanings
to
convey
to
your
senses
an
entirely
new
idea
if
i
use
new
sounds
strung
together
they
are
not
words
to
you
and
convey
no
meaning
if
i
use
words
familiar
they
reach
backward
as
well
as
forward
thus
it
is
possible
to
instruct
you
by
a
laborious
course
of
reasoning
concerning
a
phenomenon
that
is
connected
with
phenomena
already
understood
by
you
for
your
can
be
thrust
out
from
the
parent
stalk
and
can
thus
follow
the
outreaching
branches
however
in
the
case
of
phenomena
that
exist
on
other
planes
or
are
separated
from
any
known
material
or
force
as
is
the
true
conception
that
envelops
the
word
eternity
there
being
neither
connecting
materials
forces
nor
words
to
unite
the
outside
with
the
inside
the
known
with
the
unknown
how
can
i
tell
you
more
than
i
have
done
you
are
nevertheless
i
still
believe
that
i
can
think
outside
of
words
well
perhaps
after
you
attempt
to
do
so
and
fail
again
and
again
you
will
appreciate
that
a
truth
is
a
truth
humiliating
as
it
may
be
to
acknowledge
the
fact
a
digger
indian
has
scarcely
a
i
asserted
loth
to
relinquish
the
argument
you
can
go
farther
back
if
you
desire
back
to
primitive
man
man
without
language
at
all
and
with
ideas
as
circumscribed
as
those
of
the
brutes
and
still
you
have
not
strengthened
your
argument
concerning
civilized
man
but
you
are
tired
i
see
yes
tired
of
endeavoring
to
combat
your
assertions
you
invariably
lead
me
into
the
realms
of
speculation
and
then
throw
me
upon
the
defensive
by
asking
me
to
prove
my
own
theories
or
with
apparent
sincerity
you
advance
an
unreasonable
hypothesis
and
then
before
i
am
aware
of
your
purpose
force
me
to
acquiesce
because
i
can
not
find
facts
to
confute
you
you
very
artfully
throw
the
burden
of
proof
on
me
in
all
cases
for
either
by
physical
comparisons
that
i
can
not
make
i
must
demonstrate
the
falsity
of
your
metaphysical
assertions
or
by
abstract
reasonings
disprove
statements
you
assert
to
be
facts
you
are
peevish
and
exhausted
or
you
would
perceive
that
i
have
generally
allowed
you
to
make
the
issue
and
more
than
once
have
endeavored
to
dissuade
you
from
doing
so
besides
did
i
not
several
times
in
the
past
bring
experimental
proof
to
dispel
your
incredulity
have
i
not
been
courteous
yes
i
petulantly
admitted
yes
then
i
determined
to
imitate
his
artful
methods
and
throw
him
upon
the
defensive
as
often
as
he
had
done
with
me
i
had
finally
become
familiar
with
his
process
of
arguing
a
question
for
instead
of
coming
immediately
to
his
subject
he
invariably
led
by
circuitous
route
to
the
matter
under
discussion
before
reaching
the
point
he
would
manage
to
commit
me
to
his
own
side
of
the
subject
or
place
me
in
a
defenseless
position
so
with
covert
aim
i
began
i
believe
that
friction
is
one
method
of
producing
heat
yes
i
have
been
told
that
the
north
american
indians
make
fires
by
rubbing
together
two
pieces
of
dry
wood
true
i
have
understood
that
the
light
of
a
shooting
star
results
from
the
heat
of
friction
producing
combustion
of
its
particles
partly
he
answered
that
when
the
meteoric
fragment
of
space
dust
strikes
the
air
the
friction
resulting
from
its
velocity
heats
it
to
redness
fuses
its
surface
or
even
burns
its
very
substance
into
ashes
yes
i
have
seen
the
spindle
of
a
wheel
charred
by
friction
yes
i
have
drawn
a
wire
rapidly
through
a
handkerchief
tightly
grasped
in
my
hands
and
have
warmed
the
wire
considerably
in
doing
so
yes
i
felt
that
i
had
him
committed
to
my
side
of
the
question
and
i
prepared
to
force
him
to
disprove
the
possibility
of
one
assertion
that
he
had
made
concerning
his
journey
you
stated
that
you
rode
in
a
boat
on
the
underground
lake
yes
with
great
rapidity
yes
rapid
motion
produces
friction
i
believe
yes
and
heat
yes
why
did
not
your
boat
become
heated
even
to
redness
you
rode
at
the
rate
of
nine
hundred
miles
an
hour
i
cried
exultingly
for
two
reasons
he
calmly
replied
two
natural
causes
prevented
such
a
catastrophe
and
again
he
warned
me
as
he
had
done
before
by
saying
while
you
should
not
seek
for
supernatural
agencies
to
account
for
any
phenomena
in
life
for
all
that
is
is
natural
neither
should
you
fail
to
study
the
differences
that
varying
conditions
produce
in
results
already
known
a
miracle
ceases
to
be
a
miracle
when
we
understand
the
scientific
cause
underlying
the
wonder
occultism
is
natural
for
if
there
be
occult
phenomena
they
must
be
governed
by
natural
law
mystery
is
not
mysterious
if
the
veil
of
ignorance
that
envelops
the
investigator
is
lifted
what
you
have
said
is
true
concerning
the
heat
that
results
from
friction
but
first
the
attraction
of
gravitation
was
inconsiderable
where
the
boat
to
which
you
refer
rested
on
the
water
second
the
changing
water
carried
away
the
heat
as
fast
as
it
was
produced
while
it
is
true
that
a
cannon
ball
becomes
heated
in
its
motion
through
the
air
its
surface
is
cooled
when
it
strikes
a
body
of
water
notwithstanding
that
its
great
velocity
is
altogether
overcome
by
the
water
the
friction
between
the
water
and
the
iron
does
not
result
in
heated
iron
but
the
contrary
the
water
above
the
rapids
of
a
river
has
practically
the
temperature
of
the
water
below
the
rapids
regardless
of
the
friction
that
ensues
between
these
points
admit
however
that
heat
is
liberated
as
the
result
of
the
friction
of
solids
with
water
and
still
it
does
not
follow
that
this
heat
will
perceptibly
affect
the
solid
with
a
boat
each
particle
of
water
carries
the
heat
away
each
succeeding
portion
of
water
takes
up
the
heat
liberated
by
that
preceding
it
thus
the
great
body
of
water
over
which
our
boat
sped
in
obedience
to
the
ordinary
law
became
slightly
warmed
but
its
effect
upon
the
boat
was
scarcely
perceptible
your
comparison
of
the
motion
of
a
meteor
with
that
of
our
boat
was
unhappy
we
moved
rapidly
it
is
true
in
comparison
with
the
motion
of
vessels
such
as
you
know
but
comparison
can
not
be
easily
drawn
between
the
velocity
of
a
boat
and
that
of
a
meteor
while
we
moved
at
the
rate
of
many
miles
a
minute
a
meteor
moves
many
times
faster
perhaps
as
many
miles
in
a
second
then
you
must
remember
that
the
force
of
gravitation
was
so
slight
in
our
position
that
enough
i
interrupted
we
will
pass
the
subject
it
seems
that
you
draw
upon
science
for
knowledge
to
support
your
arguments
however
irrational
they
may
be
and
then
you
sneer
at
this
same
method
of
argument
when
i
employ
it
he
replied
to
my
peevish
complaint
with
the
utmost
respect
by
calling
to
my
attention
the
fact
that
my
own
forced
argument
had
led
to
the
answer
and
that
he
had
simply
replied
to
my
attacks
said
he
if
i
am
wrong
in
my
philosophy
based
on
your
science
thought
i
am
right
in
my
facts
and
science
thought
is
thus
in
the
wrong
for
facts
overbalance
theory
i
ask
you
only
to
give
me
the
attention
that
my
statements
merit
i
am
sincere
and
aim
to
serve
your
interests
should
investigation
lead
you
hereafter
to
infer
that
i
am
in
error
at
our
final
interview
you
can
have
my
considerate
attention
be
more
charitable
please
then
he
added
is
there
any
other
subject
you
wish
to
argue
yes
i
answered
and
again
my
combativeness
arose
yes
one
of
the
truly
edifying
features
of
your
narrative
is
that
of
the
intelligent
guide
and
i
emphasized
the
word
intelligent
and
curled
up
my
lip
in
a
sarcastic
manner
proceed
he
was
verily
a
wonderful
being
an
eyeless
creature
and
yet
possessed
of
sight
and
perception
beyond
that
of
mortal
man
a
creature
who
had
been
locked
in
the
earth
and
yet
was
more
familiar
with
its
surface
than
a
philosopher
a
monstrosity
and
yet
possessed
of
the
mind
of
a
sage
he
was
a
scientific
expert
a
naturalist
a
metaphysical
reasoner
a
critic
of
religion
and
a
prophet
he
could
see
in
absolute
darkness
as
well
as
in
daylight
without
a
compass
he
could
guide
a
boat
over
a
trackless
sea
and
could
accomplish
feats
that
throw
gulliver
and
munchausen
into
disrepute
in
perfect
composure
my
aged
guest
listened
to
my
cynical
and
almost
insulting
tirade
he
made
no
effort
to
restrain
my
impetuous
sentences
and
when
i
had
finished
replied
in
the
polished
language
of
a
scholarly
gentleman
you
state
truly
construe
my
words
properly
as
well
as
understand
correctly
then
he
continued
musingly
as
though
speaking
to
himself
i
would
be
at
fault
and
deserve
censure
did
i
permit
doubts
to
be
thrown
upon
so
clear
a
subject
or
discredit
on
so
magnanimous
a
person
turning
to
me
he
continued
certainly
i
did
not
intend
to
mislead
or
to
be
misunderstood
and
am
pleased
to
find
you
so
earnest
a
scholar
and
then
in
his
soft
mild
manner
he
commenced
his
detail
reply
pouring
oil
upon
the
waters
of
my
troubled
soul
his
sweet
melodious
voice
being
so
in
contrast
to
my
rash
harangue
he
began
with
his
expressive
and
often
repeated
word
listen
illustration
we
passed
through
caverns
filled
with
creeping
reptiles
listen
you
are
right
my
guide
was
a
being
wonderful
to
mortals
he
was
eyeless
but
as
i
have
shown
you
before
and
now
swear
to
the
fact
was
not
sightless
surely
he
said
surely
you
have
not
forgotten
that
long
ago
i
considered
the
phenomenal
instinct
at
length
he
predicted
the
future
by
means
of
his
knowledge
of
the
past
there
is
nothing
wonderful
in
that
can
not
a
civil
engineer
continue
a
line
into
the
beyond
and
predict
where
the
projection
of
that
line
will
strike
can
he
not
also
calculate
the
effect
that
a
curve
will
have
on
his
line
destiny
why
should
a
being
conversant
with
the
lines
and
curves
of
humanity
journey
for
ages
past
not
be
able
to
indicate
the
lines
that
men
must
follow
in
the
future
of
course
he
could
guide
the
boat
in
what
was
to
me
a
trackless
waste
of
water
but
you
err
in
asserting
that
i
had
said
he
did
not
have
a
guide
even
if
it
were
not
a
compass
many
details
concerning
this
journey
have
not
been
explained
to
you
indeed
i
have
acquainted
you
with
but
little
that
i
experienced
near
surface
earth
we
passed
through
caverns
filled
with
creeping
reptiles
through
others
we
were
surrounded
by
flying
creatures
neither
beast
nor
bird
we
passed
through
passages
of
ooze
and
labyrinths
of
apparently
interminable
structures
to
have
disported
on
such
features
of
my
journey
would
have
been
impracticable
from
time
to
time
i
experienced
strains
of
melody
such
as
never
before
had
i
conceived
seemingly
choruses
of
angels
were
singing
in
and
to
my
very
soul
from
empty
space
about
me
from
out
the
crevices
beyond
and
behind
me
from
the
depths
of
my
spirit
within
me
came
these
strains
in
notes
clear
and
distinct
but
yet
indescribable
did
i
fancy
or
was
it
real
i
will
not
pretend
to
say
flowers
and
structures
beautiful
insects
gorgeous
and
inexplicable
were
spread
before
me
figures
and
forms
i
can
not
attempt
to
indicate
in
word
descriptions
ever
and
anon
surrounded
accompanied
and
passed
me
by
the
canvas
conceptions
of
artists
bring
to
mind
no
forms
so
strange
and
weird
and
yet
so
beautiful
as
were
these
compound
beings
restful
beyond
description
was
it
to
drink
in
the
indescribable
strains
of
poetry
of
motion
that
i
appreciated
in
the
movements
of
fair
creatures
i
have
not
mentioned
and
it
was
no
less
soothing
to
experience
the
soul
relief
wrought
by
the
sounds
about
me
for
musicians
know
no
notes
so
sweet
and
entrancing
there
were
also
in
side
caverns
to
which
i
was
led
combinations
of
sounds
and
scenes
in
which
floating
strains
and
fleeting
figures
were
interwoven
and
interlaced
so
closely
that
the
senses
of
both
sight
and
hearing
became
blended
into
a
single
sense
new
weird
strange
and
inexpressible
as
flavor
is
the
combination
of
odor
and
taste
and
is
neither
taste
nor
odor
so
these
sounds
and
scenes
combined
were
neither
scenes
nor
sounds
but
a
complex
sensation
new
delicious
sometimes
i
begged
to
be
permitted
to
stop
and
live
forever
those
heavenly
charms
but
with
as
firm
a
hand
as
when
helping
me
through
the
chambers
of
mire
ooze
and
creeping
reptiles
my
guide
drew
me
onward
but
to
return
to
the
subject
as
to
my
guide
being
a
monstrosity
i
do
not
remember
to
have
said
that
he
was
and
if
i
have
forgotten
a
fact
i
regret
my
short
memory
did
i
say
that
he
was
always
a
cavern
being
did
i
assert
that
he
had
never
lived
among
mortals
of
upper
earth
if
so
i
do
not
remember
our
conversation
on
that
subject
he
was
surely
a
sage
in
knowledge
as
you
have
experienced
from
my
feeble
efforts
in
explaining
the
nature
of
phenomena
that
were
to
you
unknown
and
yet
have
been
gained
by
me
largely
through
his
instruction
he
was
a
metaphysician
as
you
assert
you
are
surely
right
he
was
a
sincere
earnest
reasoner
and
teacher
he
was
a
conscientious
student
and
did
not
by
any
word
lead
me
to
feel
that
he
did
not
respect
all
religions
and
bow
to
the
creator
of
the
universe
its
sciences
and
its
religions
his
demeanor
was
most
considerate
his
methods
faultless
his
love
of
nature
deep
his
patience
inexhaustible
his
sincerity
unimpeachable
yes
the
old
man
said
you
are
right
in
your
admiration
of
this
lovely
personage
and
when
you
come
to
meet
this
being
as
you
are
destined
yet
to
do
for
know
now
that
you
too
will
some
day
pass
from
surface
earth
and
leave
only
your
name
in
connection
with
this
story
of
myself
you
will
surely
then
form
a
still
greater
love
and
a
deeper
respect
for
one
so
gifted
and
yet
so
old
man
i
cried
you
mock
me
i
spoke
facetiously
and
you
answer
literally
know
that
i
have
no
confidence
in
your
tales
your
marco
polo
history
ah
you
discredit
marco
polo
and
why
do
you
doubt
because
i
have
never
seen
such
phenomena
i
have
never
witnessed
such
occurrences
i
must
see
a
thing
to
believe
it
and
so
you
believe
only
what
you
see
he
queried
yes
now
answer
promptly
he
commanded
and
his
manner
changed
as
by
magic
to
that
of
a
master
did
you
ever
see
greenland
no
iceland
no
a
geyser
no
a
whale
no
england
no
france
no
a
walrus
no
then
you
do
not
believe
that
these
conditions
countries
and
animals
have
an
existence
of
course
they
have
why
others
have
seen
them
ah
he
said
then
you
wish
to
modify
your
assertion
you
only
believe
what
others
have
seen
excepting
one
person
i
retorted
then
he
continued
seemingly
not
having
noticed
my
personal
allusion
have
you
ever
seen
your
heart
i
hesitated
answer
he
commanded
no
your
stomach
no
have
you
seen
the
stomach
of
any
of
your
friends
no
the
back
of
your
head
i
became
irritated
and
made
no
reply
answer
he
again
commanded
i
have
seen
its
reflection
in
a
glass
i
say
no
he
replied
you
have
not
you
are
impudent
i
exclaimed
not
at
all
he
said
good
humoredly
how
easy
it
is
to
make
a
mistake
i
venture
to
say
that
you
have
never
seen
the
reflection
of
the
back
of
your
head
in
a
mirror
your
presumption
astounds
me
i
will
leave
it
to
yourself
he
took
a
from
the
table
and
held
it
behind
my
head
now
do
you
see
the
reflection
no
the
glass
is
behind
me
ah
yes
and
so
is
the
back
of
your
head
look
i
said
pointing
to
the
great
mirror
on
the
bureau
look
there
is
the
reflection
of
the
back
of
my
head
no
it
is
the
reflection
of
the
reflection
in
my
you
have
tricked
me
you
quibble
well
he
said
ignoring
my
remark
what
do
you
believe
i
believe
what
others
have
seen
and
what
i
can
do
excluding
myself
as
to
what
others
have
seen
he
said
facetiously
perhaps
i
answered
relenting
somewhat
has
any
man
of
your
acquaintance
seen
the
middle
of
africa
no
the
center
of
the
earth
no
the
opposite
side
of
the
moon
no
the
soul
of
man
no
heat
light
electricity
no
then
you
do
not
believe
that
africa
has
a
midland
the
earth
a
center
the
moon
an
opposite
side
man
a
soul
force
an
existence
you
distort
my
meaning
well
i
ask
questions
in
accord
with
your
suggestions
and
you
defeat
yourself
you
have
now
only
one
point
left
you
believe
only
what
can
do
illustration
flowers
and
structures
beautiful
insects
gorgeous
yes
i
will
rest
this
case
on
one
statement
then
and
you
may
be
the
judge
agreed
you
can
not
do
what
any
child
in
cincinnati
can
accomplish
i
assert
that
any
other
man
any
other
woman
in
the
city
can
do
more
than
you
can
no
cripple
is
so
helpless
no
invalid
so
feeble
as
not
in
this
respect
to
be
your
superior
you
insult
me
i
again
retorted
almost
viciously
do
you
dispute
the
assertion
seriously
yes
well
let
me
see
you
kiss
your
elbow
involuntarily
i
twisted
my
arm
so
as
to
bring
the
elbow
towards
my
mouth
then
as
i
caught
the
full
force
of
his
meaning
the
ridiculous
result
of
my
passionate
wager
came
over
me
and
i
laughed
aloud
it
was
a
change
of
thought
from
the
sublime
to
the
ludicrous
the
guest
smiled
in
return
and
kindly
said
it
pleases
me
to
find
you
in
good
humor
at
last
i
will
return
evening
and
resume
the
reading
of
my
manuscript
in
the
meantime
take
good
exercise
eat
heartily
and
become
more
cheerful
he
rose
and
bowed
himself
out
the
old
man
continues
his
manuscript
chapter
xliv
the
fathomless
the
edge
of
the
earth
shell
promptly
at
eight
the
next
evening
the
old
man
entered
my
room
he
did
not
allude
to
the
occurrences
of
the
previous
evening
and
for
this
considerate
treatment
i
felt
thankful
as
my
part
in
those
episodes
had
not
been
enviable
he
placed
his
hat
on
the
table
and
in
his
usual
cool
and
deliberate
manner
commenced
reading
as
follows
for
a
long
time
thereafter
we
journeyed
on
in
silence
now
amid
stately
stone
pillars
then
through
great
cliff
openings
or
among
gigantic
formations
that
often
stretched
away
like
cities
or
towns
dotted
over
a
plain
to
vanish
in
the
distance
then
the
scene
changed
and
we
traversed
magnificent
avenues
bounded
by
solid
walls
which
expanded
into
lofty
caverns
of
illimitable
extent
from
whence
we
found
ourselves
creeping
through
narrow
crevices
and
threading
winding
passages
barely
sufficient
to
admit
our
bodies
for
a
considerable
period
i
had
noted
the
absence
of
water
and
as
we
passed
from
grotto
to
temple
reared
without
hands
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
could
not
now
observe
evidence
of
water
erosion
in
the
stony
surface
over
which
we
trod
and
which
had
been
so
abundant
before
we
reached
the
lake
my
guide
explained
by
saying
in
reply
to
my
thought
question
that
we
were
beneath
the
water
line
he
said
that
liquids
were
impelled
back
towards
the
surface
from
a
point
unnoticed
by
me
but
long
since
passed
neither
did
i
now
experience
hunger
nor
thirst
in
the
slightest
degree
a
circumstance
which
my
guide
assured
me
was
perfectly
natural
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
neither
waste
of
tissue
nor
consumption
of
heat
in
my
present
organism
illustration
with
fear
and
trembling
i
crept
on
my
knees
to
his
side
at
last
i
observed
far
in
the
distance
a
slanting
sheet
of
light
that
stood
as
a
barrier
across
the
way
beyond
it
neither
earth
nor
earth
surface
appeared
as
we
approached
the
distinctness
of
its
outline
disappeared
and
when
we
came
nearer
i
found
that
it
streamed
into
the
space
above
from
what
appeared
to
be
a
crevice
or
break
in
the
earth
that
stretched
across
our
pathway
and
was
apparently
limitless
and
bottomless
is
this
another
hallucination
i
queried
no
it
is
a
reality
let
us
advance
to
the
brink
slowly
we
pursued
our
way
for
i
hesitated
and
held
back
i
had
really
begun
to
distrust
my
own
senses
and
my
guide
in
the
lead
was
even
forced
to
demonstrate
the
feasibility
of
the
way
step
by
step
before
i
could
be
induced
to
follow
at
length
we
neared
the
edge
of
the
chasm
and
while
he
stood
boldly
upright
by
the
brink
with
fear
and
trembling
i
crept
on
my
knees
to
his
side
and
together
we
faced
a
magnificent
but
fearful
void
that
stretched
beneath
and
beyond
us
into
a
profundity
of
space
i
peered
into
the
chamber
of
light
that
indescribable
gulf
of
brilliancy
but
vainly
sought
for
an
opposite
wall
there
was
none
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
vacancy
illuminated
vacancy
greeted
my
vision
the
light
that
sprung
from
that
void
was
not
dazzling
but
was
possessed
of
a
beauty
that
no
words
can
suggest
i
peered
downward
and
found
that
we
stood
upon
the
edge
of
a
shelving
ledge
of
stone
that
receded
rapidly
beneath
us
so
that
we
seemed
to
rest
upon
the
upper
side
of
its
edge
i
strained
my
vision
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
bottom
of
this
chasm
but
although
i
realized
that
my
eyes
were
glancing
into
miles
and
miles
of
space
there
was
no
evidence
of
earthly
material
other
than
the
brink
upon
which
we
stood
the
limit
of
vision
seemed
to
be
bounded
by
a
silvery
blending
of
light
with
light
light
alone
only
light
the
dead
silence
about
and
the
new
light
before
me
combined
to
produce
a
weird
sensation
inexplicable
overpowering
a
speck
of
dust
on
the
edge
of
immensity
i
clung
to
the
stone
cliff
gazing
into
the
depths
of
that
immeasurable
void
chapter
xlv
my
heart
throb
is
stilled
and
yet
i
live
it
now
becomes
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
this
is
one
of
the
stages
in
our
journey
that
can
only
be
passed
by
the
exercise
of
the
greatest
will
force
owing
to
our
former
surroundings
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
to
your
inheritance
of
a
instinctive
education
you
would
naturally
suppose
that
we
are
now
on
the
brink
of
an
impassable
chasm
this
sphere
of
material
vacuity
extends
beneath
us
to
a
depth
that
i
am
sure
you
will
be
astonished
to
learn
is
over
six
thousand
miles
we
may
now
look
straight
into
the
earth
cavity
and
this
streaming
light
is
the
reflected
purity
of
the
space
below
the
opposite
side
of
this
crevice
out
of
sight
by
reason
of
its
distance
but
horizontally
across
from
where
we
stand
is
precipitous
and
comparatively
solid
extending
upward
to
the
material
that
forms
the
earth
surface
we
have
during
our
journey
traversed
an
oblique
tortuous
natural
passage
that
extends
from
the
spot
at
which
you
entered
the
cave
in
kentucky
diagonally
down
into
the
crust
of
the
globe
terminating
in
this
shelving
bluff
i
would
recall
to
your
mind
that
your
journey
up
to
this
time
has
been
of
your
own
free
will
and
accord
at
each
period
of
vacillation
and
you
could
not
help
but
waver
occasionally
you
have
been
at
liberty
to
return
to
surface
earth
again
but
each
time
you
decided
wisely
to
continue
your
course
you
can
now
return
if
your
courage
is
not
sufficient
to
overcome
your
fear
but
this
is
the
last
opportunity
you
will
have
to
reconsider
while
in
my
company
have
others
overcome
the
instinctive
terrors
to
which
you
allude
yes
but
usually
the
dread
of
death
or
an
unbearable
uncertainty
compels
the
traveler
to
give
up
in
despair
before
reaching
this
spot
and
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
is
lost
yes
an
opportunity
that
occurs
only
in
the
lifetime
of
one
person
out
of
millions
of
but
few
in
our
brotherhood
then
i
can
return
if
i
so
elect
certainly
will
you
inform
me
concerning
the
nature
of
the
obstacle
i
have
to
overcome
that
you
indicate
by
your
vague
references
we
must
descend
from
this
cliff
you
can
not
be
in
earnest
why
do
you
not
see
that
the
stone
recedes
from
beneath
us
that
we
stand
on
the
edge
of
a
wedge
overhanging
bottomless
space
that
i
understand
there
is
no
ladder
and
then
the
foolish
remark
abashed
me
as
i
thought
of
a
ladder
six
thousand
miles
in
length
go
on
he
made
no
reference
to
my
confusion
there
is
practically
no
bottom
i
asserted
if
i
can
believe
your
words
you
told
me
so
and
that
i
reiterate
the
feat
is
impracticable
impossible
and
only
a
madman
would
think
of
trying
to
descend
into
such
a
depth
of
space
then
an
idea
came
over
me
perhaps
there
existed
a
route
at
some
other
point
of
the
earth
crevice
by
which
we
could
reach
the
under
side
of
the
stone
shelf
and
i
intimated
as
much
to
the
guide
no
we
must
descend
from
this
point
for
it
is
the
only
entrance
to
the
hollow
beneath
we
withdrew
from
the
brink
and
i
meditated
in
silence
then
i
crept
again
to
the
edge
of
the
bluff
and
lying
flat
on
my
chest
craned
my
head
over
and
peered
down
into
the
luminous
gulf
the
texture
of
the
receding
mineral
was
distinctly
visible
for
a
considerable
distance
and
then
far
far
beneath
all
semblance
to
material
form
disappeared
as
the
hull
of
a
vessel
fades
in
deep
clear
water
as
i
gazed
into
the
gulf
it
seemed
evident
that
as
a
board
floating
in
water
is
bounded
by
water
this
rock
really
ended
i
turned
to
my
guide
and
questioned
him
stone
in
this
situation
is
as
cork
he
replied
it
is
nearly
devoid
of
weight
your
surmise
is
correct
we
stand
on
the
shelving
edge
of
a
cliff
of
earthly
matter
that
in
this
spot
slants
upward
from
beneath
like
the
bow
of
a
boat
we
have
reached
the
bottom
of
the
film
of
space
dust
on
the
bubble
of
energy
that
forms
the
skeleton
of
earth
i
clutched
the
edge
of
the
cliff
with
both
hands
be
not
frightened
have
i
not
told
you
that
if
you
wish
to
return
you
can
do
so
now
hearken
to
me
a
short
time
ago
you
endeavored
to
convince
me
that
we
could
not
descend
from
this
precipice
and
you
are
aware
that
your
arguments
were
without
foundation
you
drew
upon
your
knowledge
of
earth
materials
as
you
once
learned
them
and
realized
at
the
time
that
you
deluded
yourself
in
doing
so
for
you
know
that
present
conditions
are
not
such
as
exist
above
ground
you
are
now
influenced
by
surroundings
that
are
entirely
different
from
those
that
govern
the
lives
of
men
upon
the
earth
surface
you
are
almost
without
weight
you
have
nearly
ceased
to
breathe
as
long
since
you
discovered
and
soon
i
hope
will
agree
entirely
to
suspend
that
harsh
and
wearying
movement
your
heart
scarcely
pulsates
and
if
you
go
with
me
farther
in
this
journey
will
soon
cease
to
beat
i
started
up
and
turned
to
flee
but
he
grasped
and
held
me
firmly
would
you
murder
me
do
you
think
i
will
mutely
acquiesce
while
you
coolly
inform
me
of
your
inhuman
intent
and
gloat
over
the
fact
that
my
heart
will
soon
be
as
stone
and
that
i
will
be
a
corpse
he
attempted
to
break
in
but
i
proceeded
in
frenzy
i
return
to
upper
earth
to
sunshine
and
humanity
i
retreat
while
yet
in
health
and
strength
and
although
i
have
in
apparent
willingness
accompanied
you
to
this
point
learn
now
that
at
all
times
i
have
been
possessed
of
the
means
to
defend
myself
from
personal
violence
i
drew
from
my
pocket
the
bar
of
iron
see
this
i
secreted
about
my
person
in
the
fresh
air
of
upper
earth
the
sweet
sunshine
of
heaven
fearing
that
i
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
men
with
whom
i
must
combat
back
back
i
cried
he
released
his
hold
of
my
person
and
folded
his
arms
upon
his
breast
then
quietly
faced
me
standing
directly
between
myself
and
the
passage
we
had
trod
while
i
stood
on
the
brink
my
back
to
that
fearful
chasm
by
a
single
push
he
could
thrust
me
into
the
fathomless
gulf
below
and
with
the
realization
of
that
fact
i
felt
that
it
was
now
a
life
and
death
struggle
with
every
muscle
strained
to
its
utmost
tension
with
my
soul
on
fire
my
brain
frenzied
i
drew
back
the
bar
of
iron
to
smite
the
apparently
defenseless
being
in
the
forehead
but
he
moved
not
and
as
i
made
the
motion
he
calmly
remarked
do
you
remember
the
history
of
hiram
abiff
illustration
i
drew
back
the
bar
of
iron
to
smite
the
apparently
defenseless
being
in
the
forehead
the
hand
that
held
the
weapon
dropped
as
if
stricken
by
paralysis
and
a
flood
of
recollections
concerning
my
lost
home
overcame
me
i
had
raised
my
hand
against
a
brother
the
only
being
of
my
kind
who
could
aid
me
or
assist
me
either
to
advance
or
recede
how
could
i
unaided
recross
that
glassy
lake
and
pass
through
the
grotesque
forests
of
fungi
and
the
labyrinth
of
crystal
grottoes
of
the
salt
bed
how
could
i
find
my
way
in
the
utter
darkness
that
existed
in
the
damp
soppy
dripping
upper
caverns
that
i
must
retrace
before
i
could
hope
to
reach
the
surface
of
the
earth
forgive
me
i
sobbed
and
sunk
at
his
feet
forgive
me
my
friend
my
brother
i
have
been
wild
mad
am
crazed
he
made
no
reply
but
pointed
over
my
shoulder
into
the
space
beyond
i
turned
and
in
the
direction
indicated
saw
in
amazement
floating
in
the
distant
space
a
and
vessel
in
full
sail
she
was
headed
diagonally
from
us
and
was
moving
rapidly
across
the
field
of
vision
every
spar
and
sail
was
clearly
defined
and
on
her
deck
and
in
the
rigging
i
beheld
sailors
clad
in
winter
garments
pursuing
their
various
duties
as
i
gazed
enraptured
she
disappeared
in
the
distance
a
phantom
vessel
i
murmured
no
he
replied
the
abstraction
of
a
vessel
sailing
on
the
ocean
above
us
every
object
on
earth
is
the
second
to
an
imprint
in
another
place
there
is
an
apparent
reproduction
of
matter
in
vacancy
and
on
unseen
pages
a
recording
of
all
events
as
that
ship
sailed
over
the
ocean
above
us
she
disturbed
a
current
of
energy
and
it
left
its
impress
as
an
outline
on
a
certain
zone
beneath
which
is
parallel
with
that
upon
which
we
now
chance
to
stand
i
can
not
comprehend
i
muttered
no
he
answered
to
you
it
seems
miraculous
as
to
all
men
an
unexplained
phenomenon
approaches
the
supernatural
all
that
is
is
natural
have
men
not
been
told
in
sacred
writings
that
their
every
movement
is
being
recorded
in
the
book
of
life
and
do
they
not
often
doubt
because
they
can
not
grasp
the
problem
may
not
the
greatest
scientist
be
the
most
apt
skeptic
yes
i
replied
you
have
just
seen
he
said
the
record
of
an
act
on
earth
and
in
detail
it
is
being
printed
elsewhere
in
the
book
of
eternity
if
you
should
return
to
earth
surface
you
could
not
by
stating
these
facts
convince
even
the
persons
on
that
same
ship
of
your
sanity
you
could
not
make
them
believe
that
hundreds
of
miles
beneath
both
their
vessel
and
its
crew
had
been
reproduced
in
fac
simile
could
you
no
were
you
to
return
to
earth
you
could
not
convince
men
that
you
had
existed
without
breath
with
a
heart
dead
within
you
if
you
should
try
to
impress
on
mankind
the
facts
that
you
have
learned
in
this
journey
what
would
be
the
result
i
would
probably
be
considered
mentally
deranged
this
i
have
before
admitted
would
it
not
be
better
then
he
continued
to
go
with
me
by
your
own
free
will
into
the
unknown
future
which
you
need
fear
less
than
a
return
to
the
scoffing
multitude
amid
the
storms
of
upper
earth
you
know
that
i
have
not
at
any
time
deceived
you
i
have
as
yet
only
opened
before
you
a
part
of
one
rare
page
out
of
the
boundless
book
of
nature
you
have
tasted
of
the
sweets
of
which
few
persons
in
the
flesh
have
sipped
and
i
now
promise
you
a
further
store
of
knowledge
that
is
rich
beyond
conception
if
you
wish
to
continue
your
journey
what
if
i
decide
to
return
i
will
retrace
my
footsteps
and
liberate
you
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
as
i
have
others
for
few
persons
have
courage
enough
to
pass
this
spot
binding
me
to
an
oath
of
secrecy
illustration
sprung
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
into
the
abyss
below
carrying
me
with
him
into
its
depths
no
he
answered
for
if
you
relate
these
events
men
will
consider
you
a
madman
and
the
more
clearly
you
attempt
to
explain
the
facts
that
you
have
witnessed
the
less
they
will
listen
to
you
such
has
been
the
fate
of
others
it
is
indeed
better
for
me
to
go
with
you
i
said
musingly
to
that
effect
my
mind
is
now
made
up
my
course
is
clear
i
am
ready
with
a
motion
so
quick
in
conception
and
rapid
in
execution
that
i
was
taken
altogether
by
surprise
with
a
grasp
so
powerful
that
i
could
not
have
repelled
him
had
i
expected
the
movement
and
tried
to
protect
myself
the
strange
man
or
being
beside
me
threw
his
arms
around
my
body
then
as
a
part
of
the
same
movement
he
raised
me
bodily
from
the
stone
and
before
i
could
realize
the
nature
of
his
intention
sprung
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
into
the
abyss
below
carrying
me
with
him
into
its
depths
chapter
xlvi
the
inner
circle
or
the
end
of
in
the
bottomless
gulf
i
recall
a
whirling
sensation
and
an
involuntary
attempt
at
in
which
i
threw
my
arms
wildly
about
with
a
vain
endeavor
to
clutch
some
form
of
solid
body
which
movement
naturally
ended
by
a
tight
clasping
of
my
guide
in
my
arms
and
locked
together
we
continued
to
speed
down
into
the
seven
thousand
miles
of
vacancy
instinctively
i
murmured
a
prayer
of
supplication
and
awaited
the
approaching
hereafter
which
as
i
believed
would
quickly
witness
the
extinction
of
my
unhappy
life
the
end
of
my
material
existence
but
the
moments
if
time
can
be
so
divided
when
no
sun
marks
the
division
multiplied
without
bodily
shock
or
physical
pain
of
any
description
i
retained
my
consciousness
open
your
eyes
said
my
guide
you
have
no
cause
for
fear
i
acquiesced
in
an
incredulous
dazed
manner
this
unusual
experience
is
sufficient
to
unnerve
you
but
you
need
have
no
fear
for
you
are
not
in
corporal
danger
and
can
relax
your
grasp
on
my
person
i
cautiously
obeyed
him
misgivingly
and
slowly
loosened
my
hold
then
gazed
about
to
find
that
we
were
in
a
sea
of
light
and
that
only
light
was
visible
that
form
of
light
which
i
have
before
said
is
an
entity
without
source
of
radiation
in
one
direction
however
a
great
gray
cloud
hung
suspended
and
gloomy
dark
in
the
center
and
shading
therefrom
in
a
circle
to
disappear
entirely
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
this
is
the
from
which
we
sprung
said
the
guide
it
will
soon
disappear
wherever
i
glanced
this
radiant
exhalation
a
peaceful
luminous
envelope
this
rich
soft
beautiful
white
light
appeared
the
power
of
bodily
motion
i
found
still
a
factor
in
my
frame
obedient
as
before
to
my
will
i
could
move
my
limbs
freely
and
my
intellect
seemed
to
be
intact
finally
i
became
impressed
with
the
idea
that
i
must
be
at
perfect
rest
but
if
so
what
could
be
the
nature
of
the
substance
or
material
upon
which
i
was
resting
so
complacently
no
this
could
not
be
true
then
i
thought
i
have
been
instantly
killed
by
a
painless
shock
and
my
spirit
is
in
heaven
but
my
earthly
body
and
coarse
ragged
garments
were
palpable
realities
the
sense
of
touch
sight
and
hearing
surely
were
normal
and
a
consideration
of
these
facts
dispelled
my
first
conception
where
are
we
now
moving
into
earth
central
space
i
comprehend
that
a
rushing
wind
surrounds
us
which
is
not
uncomfortable
but
otherwise
i
experience
no
unusual
sensation
and
can
not
realize
but
that
i
am
at
rest
the
sensation
as
of
a
blowing
wind
is
in
consequence
of
our
rapid
motion
and
results
from
the
friction
between
our
bodies
and
the
quiescent
attenuated
atmosphere
which
exists
even
here
but
this
atmosphere
becomes
less
and
less
in
amount
until
it
will
disappear
altogether
at
a
short
distance
below
us
soon
we
will
be
in
a
perfect
calm
and
although
moving
rapidly
to
all
appearances
will
be
at
absolute
rest
naturally
perhaps
my
mind
attempted
as
it
so
often
had
done
to
urge
objections
to
his
statements
and
at
first
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
did
not
experience
the
peculiar
sinking
away
sensation
in
the
chest
that
i
remembered
follows
on
earth
the
downward
motion
of
a
person
falling
from
a
great
height
or
moving
rapidly
in
a
swing
and
i
questioned
him
on
the
absence
of
that
phenomenon
the
explanation
is
simple
he
said
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
a
sudden
motion
either
upward
or
downward
disturbs
the
equilibrium
of
the
organs
of
respiration
and
of
the
heart
and
interferes
with
the
circulation
of
the
blood
this
produces
a
change
in
blood
pressure
within
the
brain
and
the
sensation
in
the
chest
or
the
dizziness
of
the
head
of
a
person
moving
rapidly
or
it
may
even
result
in
unconsciousness
and
complete
suspension
of
respiration
effects
which
sometimes
follow
rapid
movements
as
in
a
person
falling
from
a
considerable
height
here
circumstances
are
entirely
different
the
heart
is
quiet
the
lungs
in
a
comatose
condition
and
the
blood
stagnant
mental
sensations
therefore
that
result
from
a
disturbed
condition
of
these
organs
are
wanting
and
although
we
are
experiencing
rapid
motion
we
are
in
the
full
possession
of
our
physical
selves
and
maintain
our
mental
faculties
unimpaired
again
i
interposed
an
objection
if
as
you
say
we
are
really
passing
through
an
attenuated
atmosphere
with
increasing
velocity
according
to
the
law
that
governs
falling
bodies
that
are
acted
upon
by
gravity
which
continually
accelerates
their
motion
the
friction
between
ourselves
and
the
air
will
ultimately
become
so
intense
as
to
wear
away
our
bodies
upon
the
contrary
said
he
this
attenuated
atmosphere
is
decreasing
in
density
more
rapidly
than
our
velocity
increases
and
before
long
it
will
have
altogether
disappeared
you
can
perceive
that
the
wind
as
you
call
it
is
blowing
less
violently
than
formerly
soon
it
will
entirely
cease
as
i
have
already
predicted
and
at
that
period
regardless
of
our
motion
we
will
appear
to
be
stationary
pondering
over
the
final
result
of
this
strange
experience
i
became
again
alarmed
for
accepting
the
facts
to
be
as
he
stated
such
motion
would
ultimately
carry
us
against
the
opposite
crust
of
the
earth
and
without
a
doubt
the
shock
would
end
our
existence
i
inquired
about
this
to
me
fact
and
he
replied
long
before
we
reach
the
opposite
crust
of
the
earth
our
motion
will
be
arrested
i
had
begun
now
to
feel
a
that
is
surprising
as
i
recall
that
remarkable
position
in
connection
with
my
narrow
experience
in
true
science
and
can
say
that
instead
of
despondency
i
really
enjoyed
an
elated
sensation
a
curious
exhilaration
a
feeling
of
delight
which
i
have
no
words
to
describe
life
disturbances
and
mental
worry
seemed
to
have
completely
vanished
and
it
appeared
as
if
with
mental
perception
lucid
i
were
under
the
influence
of
a
powerful
soporific
the
cares
of
mortals
had
disappeared
after
a
while
the
wind
ceased
to
blow
as
my
guide
had
predicted
and
with
the
suspension
of
that
factor
all
that
remained
to
remind
me
of
earth
phenomena
had
vanished
there
was
no
motion
of
material
nothing
to
mar
or
disturb
the
most
perfect
peace
imaginable
i
was
so
exquisitely
happy
that
i
now
actually
feared
some
change
might
occur
to
interrupt
that
quiescent
existence
it
was
as
a
deep
sweet
sleep
in
which
with
faculties
alive
unconsciousness
was
peaceful
restful
blissful
i
listlessly
turned
my
eyes
searching
space
in
all
directions
to
meet
vacancy
everywhere
absolute
vacancy
i
took
from
my
pocket
into
which
i
had
hastily
thrust
it
the
bar
of
iron
and
released
it
the
metal
remained
motionless
beside
me
traveling
through
this
expanse
with
the
rapidity
of
ourselves
said
my
guide
i
closed
my
eyes
and
endeavored
to
convince
myself
that
i
was
dreaming
vainly
however
i
opened
my
eyes
and
endeavored
to
convince
myself
that
i
was
moving
equally
in
vain
i
became
oblivious
to
everything
save
the
delicious
sensation
of
absolute
rest
that
enveloped
and
pervaded
my
being
i
am
neither
alive
nor
dead
i
murmured
neither
asleep
nor
awake
neither
moving
nor
at
rest
and
neither
standing
reclining
nor
sitting
if
i
exist
i
can
not
bring
evidence
to
prove
that
fact
neither
can
i
prove
that
i
am
dead
can
any
man
prove
either
of
these
premises
said
the
guide
i
have
never
questioned
the
matter
said
i
it
is
a
fact
know
then
said
he
that
existence
is
a
theory
and
that
man
is
incapable
of
demonstrating
that
he
has
a
being
all
evidences
of
mortal
life
are
only
as
the
phantasms
of
hallucination
as
a
moment
in
dreamland
may
span
a
life
of
time
the
dreamer
altogether
unconscious
that
it
is
a
dream
so
may
life
itself
be
a
shadow
the
vision
of
a
distempered
fancy
the
illusion
of
a
floating
thought
are
pain
pleasure
and
living
imaginary
creations
i
asked
facetiously
is
there
a
madman
who
does
not
imagine
as
facts
what
others
agree
upon
as
hallucinations
peculiar
to
himself
is
it
not
impossible
to
distinguish
between
different
gradations
of
illusions
and
is
it
not
therefore
possible
that
even
is
an
illusion
what
evidence
can
any
man
produce
to
prove
that
his
idea
of
life
is
not
a
madman
dream
proceed
i
said
at
another
time
perhaps
he
remarked
we
have
reached
the
inner
circle
the
sphere
of
rest
the
line
of
gravity
and
now
our
bodies
have
no
weight
at
this
point
we
begin
to
move
with
decreased
speed
we
will
soon
come
to
a
quiescent
condition
a
state
of
rest
and
then
start
back
on
our
rebound
chapter
xlvii
hearing
without
what
will
be
the
end
a
flood
of
recollections
came
over
me
a
vivid
remembrance
of
my
school
philosophy
i
rebel
again
i
said
i
deny
your
statements
we
can
neither
be
moving
nor
can
we
be
out
of
the
atmosphere
fool
that
i
have
been
not
to
have
sooner
and
better
used
my
reasoning
faculties
not
to
have
at
once
rejected
your
statements
concerning
the
disappearance
of
the
atmosphere
i
await
your
argument
am
i
not
speaking
is
other
argument
necessary
have
i
not
heard
your
voice
and
that
too
since
you
asserted
that
we
had
left
the
atmosphere
continue
have
not
men
demonstrated
and
is
it
not
accepted
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
sound
is
produced
by
vibrations
of
the
air
you
speak
truly
as
men
converse
on
surface
earth
this
medium
the
air
in
wave
vibrations
strikes
upon
the
drum
of
the
ear
and
thus
impresses
the
brain
i
continued
i
agree
that
such
is
the
teachings
of
your
philosophy
go
on
it
is
unnecessary
you
admit
the
facts
and
the
facts
refute
you
there
must
be
an
atmosphere
to
convey
sound
can
not
you
understand
that
you
are
not
now
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
will
you
never
learn
that
the
philosophy
of
your
former
life
is
not
philosophy
here
that
science
is
science
only
with
men
here
science
is
a
fallacy
all
that
you
have
said
is
true
of
surface
earth
but
your
argument
is
invalid
where
every
condition
is
different
from
the
conditions
that
prevail
thereon
you
use
the
organs
of
speech
in
addressing
me
as
you
once
learned
to
use
them
but
such
physical
efforts
are
unnecessary
to
convey
in
this
condition
of
rest
and
complacency
and
you
waste
energy
in
employing
them
you
assert
and
believe
that
the
air
conveys
sound
you
have
been
taught
such
theories
in
support
of
a
restricted
philosophy
but
may
i
ask
you
if
a
bar
of
iron
a
stick
of
wood
a
stream
of
water
indeed
any
substance
known
to
you
placed
against
the
ear
will
not
do
the
same
and
many
substances
even
better
than
the
atmosphere
this
i
admit
will
you
tell
me
how
the
vibration
of
any
of
these
bodies
impresses
the
seat
of
hearing
it
moves
the
atmosphere
which
strikes
upon
the
tympanum
of
the
ear
you
have
not
explained
the
phenomenon
how
does
that
tympanic
membrane
communicate
with
the
brain
by
vibrations
i
understand
i
answered
and
then
i
began
to
feel
that
this
assertion
was
a
simple
statement
and
not
sufficient
to
explain
how
matter
acts
upon
mind
whatever
mind
may
be
and
i
hesitated
pray
do
not
stop
he
said
how
is
it
that
a
delicate
vibrating
film
of
animal
membrane
can
receive
and
convey
sound
to
a
pulpy
organic
mass
that
is
destitute
of
elasticity
and
which
consists
mostly
of
water
for
the
brain
is
such
in
structure
and
vibrations
like
those
you
mention
can
not
by
your
own
theory
pass
through
it
as
vibrations
through
a
sonorous
material
or
even
reach
from
the
tympanum
of
the
ear
to
the
nearest
convolution
of
the
brain
i
can
not
explain
this
i
admit
was
my
reply
pass
that
feature
then
and
concede
that
this
tympanic
membrane
is
capable
of
materially
affecting
brain
tissue
by
its
tiny
vibrations
how
can
that
slimy
pulpy
formation
mostly
made
up
of
water
communicate
with
the
soul
of
man
for
you
do
not
claim
i
hope
that
brain
material
is
either
mind
conscience
or
soul
i
confessed
my
inability
to
answer
or
even
to
theorize
on
the
subject
and
recognizing
my
humiliation
i
begged
him
to
open
the
door
to
such
knowledge
the
vibration
of
the
atmosphere
is
necessary
to
man
as
earthy
man
is
situated
he
said
the
coarser
attributes
known
as
matter
formations
are
the
crudities
of
nature
dust
swept
from
space
man
organism
is
made
up
of
the
roughest
and
lowest
kind
of
space
materials
he
is
surrounded
by
a
turbulent
medium
the
air
and
these
various
conditions
obscure
or
destroy
the
finer
attributes
of
his
ethereal
nature
and
prevent
a
higher
spiritual
evolution
his
spiritual
self
is
enveloped
in
earth
and
everywhere
thwarted
by
earthy
materials
he
is
insensible
to
the
finer
influences
of
surrounding
media
by
reason
of
the
overwhelming
necessity
of
a
war
for
existence
with
the
grossly
antagonistic
materialistic
confusion
that
everywhere
confronts
surrounds
and
pervades
him
such
a
conflict
with
extraneous
matter
is
necessary
in
order
that
he
may
retain
his
earthy
being
for
to
remain
a
mortal
he
must
work
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
his
organs
of
communication
and
perception
are
of
earthy
his
nature
is
cast
in
a
mold
of
clay
and
the
blood
within
him
gurgles
and
struggles
in
his
brain
a
whirlpool
of
madly
rushing
liquid
substances
creating
disorder
in
the
primal
realms
of
consciousness
he
is
ignorant
of
this
inward
turmoil
because
he
has
never
been
without
it
as
ignorant
as
he
is
of
the
rank
odors
of
the
gases
of
the
atmosphere
that
he
has
always
breathed
and
can
not
perceive
because
of
the
benumbed
olfactory
nerves
thus
it
is
that
all
his
subtler
senses
are
inevitably
blunted
and
perverted
and
his
vulgar
nature
preponderates
the
rich
essential
part
of
his
own
self
is
unknown
even
to
himself
the
possibility
of
delight
and
pleasure
in
an
acquaintance
with
the
finer
attributes
of
his
own
soul
is
clouded
by
this
shrouding
materialistic
presence
that
has
through
countless
generations
become
a
part
of
man
and
he
even
derives
most
of
his
mental
pleasures
from
such
acts
as
tend
to
encourage
the
animal
passions
thus
it
follows
that
the
sensitive
highly
developed
extremely
attenuated
part
of
his
inner
being
has
become
subservient
to
the
grosser
elements
the
baser
part
of
his
nature
has
become
dominant
he
remains
insensible
to
impressions
from
the
highly
developed
surrounding
media
which
being
incapable
of
reaching
his
inner
organism
other
than
through
mechanical
agencies
are
powerless
to
impress
alas
only
the
coarser
conditions
of
celestial
phenomena
can
affect
him
and
the
finer
expressions
of
the
universe
of
life
and
force
are
lost
to
his
spiritual
apprehension
would
you
have
me
view
the
soul
of
man
as
i
would
a
material
being
surely
he
answered
it
exists
practically
as
does
the
more
gross
forms
of
matter
and
in
exact
accord
with
natural
laws
associated
with
lower
forms
of
matter
the
soul
of
man
is
a
temporary
slave
to
the
enveloping
substance
the
ear
of
man
as
now
constituted
can
hear
only
by
means
of
vibrations
of
such
media
as
conduct
vibrations
in
matter
for
example
the
air
but
were
man
to
be
deprived
of
the
organs
of
hearing
and
then
exist
for
generations
subject
to
evolutions
from
within
whereby
the
acuteness
of
the
spirit
would
become
intensified
or
permitted
to
perform
its
true
function
he
would
learn
to
communicate
soul
to
soul
not
only
with
mankind
but
with
beings
celestial
that
surround
and
are
now
unknown
to
him
this
he
would
accomplish
through
a
medium
of
communication
that
requires
neither
ear
nor
tongue
to
an
extent
your
present
condition
is
what
men
call
supernatural
although
in
reality
you
have
been
divested
of
only
a
part
of
your
former
material
grossness
which
object
has
been
accomplished
under
perfectly
natural
conditions
your
mind
no
longer
requires
the
material
medium
by
which
to
converse
with
the
spiritual
we
are
conversing
now
by
thought
contact
there
is
no
atmosphere
here
your
tongue
moves
merely
from
habit
and
not
from
necessity
i
am
reading
your
mind
as
you
in
turn
are
mine
neither
of
us
is
speaking
as
you
were
accustomed
to
speak
i
can
not
accept
that
assertion
i
said
it
is
to
me
impossible
to
realize
the
existence
of
such
conditions
as
it
is
for
any
man
to
explain
any
phenomenon
in
life
he
said
do
you
not
remember
that
you
ceased
to
respire
and
were
not
conscious
of
the
fact
yes
that
your
heart
had
stopped
beating
your
blood
no
longer
circulated
while
you
were
in
ignorance
of
the
change
that
is
also
true
now
i
will
prove
my
last
assertion
close
your
mouth
and
think
of
a
question
you
wish
to
propound
i
did
so
and
to
my
perfect
understanding
and
comprehension
he
answered
me
with
closed
mouth
what
will
be
the
end
i
exclaimed
or
thought
aloud
i
am
possessed
of
nearly
all
the
attributes
that
i
once
supposed
inherent
only
in
a
corpse
yet
i
live
i
see
clearly
i
hear
plainly
i
have
a
quickened
being
and
a
mental
perception
intensified
and
exquisite
why
and
how
has
this
been
accomplished
what
will
be
the
result
of
this
eventful
journey
restful
you
should
say
he
remarked
the
present
is
restful
the
end
will
be
peace
now
i
will
give
you
a
lesson
concerning
the
words
why
and
how
that
you
have
just
used
chapter
xlviii
why
and
the
struggling
ray
of
light
from
those
farthermost
outreaches
confronting
mankind
there
stands
a
sphinx
the
vast
unknown
however
well
a
man
may
be
informed
concerning
a
special
subject
his
farthermost
outlook
concerning
that
subject
is
bounded
by
an
impenetrable
infinity
granted
i
interrupted
that
mankind
has
not
by
any
means
attained
a
condition
of
perfection
yet
you
must
admit
that
questions
once
regarded
as
inscrutable
problems
are
now
illuminated
by
the
discoveries
of
science
and
the
as
i
will
show
has
only
transferred
ignorance
to
other
places
he
replied
science
has
confined
its
labors
to
superficial
descriptions
not
the
elucidation
of
the
fundamental
causes
of
phenomena
i
can
not
believe
you
and
question
if
you
can
prove
what
you
say
it
needs
no
argument
to
illustrate
the
fact
science
boldly
heralds
her
descriptive
discoveries
and
as
carefully
ignores
her
explanatory
failures
she
dare
not
attempt
to
explain
the
why
even
of
the
simplest
things
why
does
the
robin
hop
and
the
snipe
walk
do
not
tell
me
this
is
beneath
the
notice
of
men
of
science
for
science
claims
that
no
subject
is
outside
her
realm
search
your
works
on
natural
history
and
see
if
your
man
of
science
who
describes
the
habits
of
these
birds
explains
the
reason
for
this
evident
fact
how
does
the
change
its
color
do
not
answer
me
in
the
usual
superficial
manner
concerning
the
reflection
of
light
but
tell
me
why
the
skin
of
that
creature
is
enabled
to
perform
this
function
how
does
the
secrete
a
sweet
wholesome
sap
and
deadly
nightshade
growing
in
the
same
soil
and
living
on
the
same
elements
a
poison
what
is
it
that
your
scientific
men
find
in
the
cells
of
root
or
rootlet
to
indicate
that
one
may
produce
a
food
and
the
other
a
noxious
secretion
that
can
destroy
life
your
microscopist
will
discuss
cell
tissues
learnedly
will
speak
fluently
of
physiological
structure
will
describe
organic
intercellular
appearances
but
ignore
all
that
lies
beyond
why
does
the
nerve
in
the
tongue

continued
my
companion
we
have
just
now
crossed
the
line
of
gravitation
we
were
drawn
downward
until
at
a
certain
point
to
which
i
called
your
attention
at
the
time
we
recently
crossed
the
curved
plane
of
perfect
rest
where
gravity
ceases
and
by
our
momentum
are
now
passing
beyond
that
plane
and
are
now
pressing
against
the
bond
of
gravitation
again
this
shell
in
which
gravity
centers
is
concentric
with
that
of
the
exterior
and
is
about
seven
hundred
miles
below
its
surface
each
moment
of
time
will
now
behold
us
carried
farther
from
this
sphere
of
attraction
and
thus
the
increasing
distance
increases
the
force
of
the
restraining
influence
our
momentum
is
thus
retarded
and
consequently
the
rapidity
of
our
motion
is
continually
decreasing
at
last
when
the
forces
of
gravitation
and
mass
motion
neutralize
each
other
we
will
come
to
a
state
of
rest
again
when
our
motion
in
this
direction
ceases
however
gravitation
imperishable
continues
to
exert
its
equalizing
influence
the
result
being
a
start
in
the
opposite
direction
and
we
will
then
reverse
our
course
and
retrace
our
path
crossing
again
the
central
band
of
attraction
to
retreat
and
fly
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
power
of
greater
attraction
into
the
expanse
from
which
we
came
and
that
is
now
above
us
can
this
oscillation
ever
end
are
we
to
remain
thus
as
an
unceasing
pendulum
traversing
space
to
and
fro
across
this
invisible
shell
of
attraction
from
now
until
the
end
of
time
no
there
are
influences
to
prevent
such
an
experience
one
being
the
friction
of
the
attenuated
atmosphere
into
which
we
plunge
each
time
that
we
cross
the
point
of
greater
gravity
and
approach
the
crust
of
the
earth
thus
each
succeeding
vibration
is
in
shorter
lines
and
at
last
we
will
come
to
a
state
of
perfect
rest
at
the
center
of
gravity
i
can
only
acquiesce
in
meek
submission
powerless
even
to
argue
for
i
perceive
that
the
foundations
for
my
arguments
must
be
based
on
those
observed
conditions
of
natural
laws
formerly
known
to
me
and
that
do
not
encompass
us
here
i
accept
therefore
your
statements
as
i
have
several
times
heretofore
because
i
can
not
refute
them
i
must
close
my
eyes
to
the
future
and
accept
it
on
faith
i
cease
to
mourn
the
past
i
can
not
presage
the
end
well
spoken
he
replied
and
while
we
are
undergoing
this
necessary
delay
this
oscillating
motion
to
which
we
must
both
submit
before
we
can
again
continue
our
journey
i
will
describe
some
conditions
inherent
in
the
three
spheres
of
which
the
rind
of
the
earth
is
composed
for
i
believe
that
you
are
now
ready
to
receive
and
profit
by
facts
that
heretofore
you
would
have
rejected
in
incredulity
the
outer
circle
coat
or
contour
of
which
you
have
heard
others
besides
myself
speak
is
the
surface
crust
of
our
globe
the
great
sphere
of
land
and
water
on
which
man
is
at
present
an
inhabitant
this
is
the
exposed
part
of
the
earth
and
is
least
desirable
as
a
residence
it
is
affected
by
grievous
atmospheric
changes
and
restless
physical
conditions
such
as
men
in
order
to
exist
in
must
fortify
against
at
the
expense
of
much
bodily
and
mental
energy
which
leads
them
necessarily
to
encourage
the
animal
at
the
expense
of
the
ethereal
the
unmodified
rays
of
the
sun
produce
aerial
convulsions
that
are
marked
by
thermal
contrasts
and
other
meteorological
variations
during
which
the
heat
of
summer
and
the
cold
of
winter
follow
each
other
periodically
and
unceasingly
these
successive
solar
pulsations
generate
winds
calms
and
storms
and
in
order
to
protect
himself
against
such
exposures
and
changes
in
material
surroundings
man
toils
suffers
and
comes
to
believe
that
the
doom
if
not
the
object
of
life
on
earth
is
the
preservation
of
the
earthy
body
all
conditions
and
phases
of
nature
on
this
outer
crust
are
in
an
angry
struggle
and
this
commotion
envelops
the
wretched
home
and
governs
the
life
of
man
the
surrounding
cyclones
of
force
and
matter
have
distorted
the
peaceful
side
of
what
human
nature
might
be
until
the
shortened
life
of
man
has
become
a
passionate
deplorable
sorrowful
struggle
for
physical
existence
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
of
these
facts
man
is
practically
ignorant
although
each
individual
is
aware
he
is
not
satisfied
with
his
condition
if
his
afflictions
were
obvious
to
himself
his
existence
would
be
typical
of
a
life
of
desolation
and
anguish
you
know
full
well
that
the
condition
of
the
outer
sphere
is
as
i
have
described
it
a
bleak
turbulent
surface
the
roof
of
the
earth
on
which
man
exists
as
a
creeping
parasite
does
on
a
rind
of
fruit
exposed
to
the
fury
of
the
earth
storms
the
central
circle
or
medial
sphere
the
shell
or
layer
of
gravitation
lies
conformably
to
the
outer
configuration
of
the
globe
about
seven
hundred
miles
towards
its
center
it
stretches
beneath
the
outer
circle
sphere
as
a
transparent
sheet
a
shell
of
energy
the
center
of
gravitation
the
material
crust
of
the
earth
rests
on
this
placid
sphere
of
vigor
excepting
in
a
few
places
where
as
in
the
crevice
we
have
entered
gaps
or
crevices
in
matter
exist
beginning
from
near
the
outer
surface
and
extending
diagonally
through
the
medial
and
inner
spheres
into
the
space
beyond
this
medial
sphere
is
a
form
of
pure
force
a
disturbance
of
motion
and
although
without
weight
it
induces
or
conserves
gravity
it
is
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
and
is
frictionless
but
really
is
the
bone
of
the
earth
on
it
matter
the
retarded
energy
of
space
space
dust
has
arranged
itself
as
dust
collects
on
a
bubble
of
water
this
we
call
matter
the
material
portion
of
the
earth
is
altogether
a
surface
film
an
insignificant
skin
over
the
sphere
of
purity
the
center
of
gravitation
although
men
naturally
imagine
that
the
density
and
stability
of
the
earth
is
dependent
on
the
earthy
particles
of
which
his
own
body
is
a
part
such
is
not
the
case
earth
as
man
upon
the
outer
surface
can
now
know
it
is
an
aggregation
of
material
particles
a
shell
resting
on
this
globular
sphere
of
medial
force
which
attracts
solid
matter
from
both
the
outer
and
inner
surfaces
of
earth
forming
thereby
the
middle
of
the
three
concentric
spheres
this
middle
sphere
is
the
reverse
of
the
outer
or
surface
layer
in
one
respect
for
while
it
attracts
solids
gases
are
repelled
by
it
and
thus
the
atmosphere
becomes
less
dense
as
we
descend
from
the
outer
surfaces
of
the
earth
the
greater
degree
of
attraction
for
gases
belongs
therefore
to
the
earth
exterior
surface
exactly
at
the
earth
exterior
surface
i
asked
practically
so
the
greatest
density
of
the
air
is
found
a
few
miles
below
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
air
becomes
more
attenuated
as
we
proceed
in
either
direction
from
that
point
were
this
not
the
case
the
atmosphere
that
surrounds
the
earth
would
be
quickly
absorbed
into
its
substance
or
expand
into
space
and
disappear
scientific
men
claim
that
the
atmosphere
is
geographical
miles
in
depth
over
the
earth
surface
i
said
if
the
earth
is
eight
thousand
miles
in
diameter
how
long
would
such
an
atmosphere
a
skin
only
over
a
great
ball
resist
such
attraction
and
remain
above
the
globe
were
it
really
attracted
towards
its
center
it
would
disappear
as
a
film
of
water
sinks
into
a
sponge
do
you
know
i
interrupted
that
if
these
statements
were
made
to
men
they
would
not
be
credited
scientific
men
have
calculated
the
weights
of
the
planets
and
have
estimated
therefrom
the
density
of
the
earth
showing
it
to
be
solid
and
knowing
its
density
they
would
on
this
consideration
alone
discredit
your
story
concerning
the
earth
shell
illustration
the
earth
and
its
atmosphere
the
space
between
the
inner
and
the
outer
lines
represents
the
atmosphere
upon
the
earth
the
depth
to
which
man
has
penetrated
the
earth
is
less
than
the
thickness
of
either
line
as
compared
with
the
diameter
of
the
inner
circle
you
mistake
as
you
will
presently
see
it
is
true
that
man
ingenuity
has
enabled
him
to
ascertain
the
weights
and
densities
of
the
planets
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
these
scientific
results
preclude
the
possibility
of
a
hollow
interior
of
the
heavenly
bodies
i
confess
i
do
you
should
know
then
that
what
men
define
as
density
of
the
earth
is
but
an
average
value
which
is
much
higher
than
that
exhibited
by
materials
in
the
surface
layers
of
the
earth
crust
such
as
come
within
the
scrutiny
of
man
this
fact
allows
mortals
of
upper
earth
but
a
vague
conjecture
as
to
the
nature
of
the
seemingly
much
heavier
substances
that
exist
in
the
interior
of
the
earth
have
men
any
data
on
hand
to
show
exactly
how
matter
is
distributed
below
the
limited
zone
that
is
accessible
to
their
investigations
i
think
not
you
may
safely
accept
then
that
the
earth
shell
i
have
described
to
you
embraces
in
a
compact
form
the
total
weight
of
the
earth
even
though
men
take
for
granted
that
matter
fills
out
the
whole
interior
of
our
planet
such
material
would
not
if
distributed
as
on
surface
give
the
earth
the
density
he
has
determined
for
it
i
must
acquiesce
in
your
explanations
let
us
now
go
a
step
further
in
this
argument
what
do
you
imagine
is
the
nature
of
those
heavier
substances
whose
existence
deep
within
the
earth
is
suggested
by
the
exceedingly
high
total
density
observed
by
man
on
upper
earth
i
am
unable
to
explain
especially
as
the
materials
surrounding
us
here
seemingly
do
not
differ
much
from
those
with
which
my
former
life
experience
has
made
me
acquainted
your
observation
is
correct
there
is
no
essential
difference
in
this
regard
but
as
we
are
descending
into
the
interior
of
this
globe
and
are
approaching
the
central
seat
of
the
shell
of
energy
the
opposing
force
into
which
we
plunge
becomes
correspondingly
stronger
and
as
a
consequence
matter
pressed
within
it
becomes
really
lighter
your
own
experience
about
your
weight
gradually
disappearing
during
this
journey
should
convince
you
of
the
correctness
of
this
fact
indeed
it
does
i
admitted
you
will
then
readily
understand
that
the
heavy
material
to
which
mortals
allude
as
probably
constituting
the
interior
of
the
earth
is
in
fact
nothing
but
the
manifestation
of
a
force
as
exemplified
in
the
sphere
of
attractive
energy
the
seat
of
which
we
are
soon
to
encounter
on
our
journey
likewise
the
mutual
attraction
of
the
heavenly
bodies
is
not
a
property
solely
of
their
material
part
but
an
expression
in
which
both
the
and
the
matter
collected
thereon
take
part
tell
me
more
of
the
sphere
in
which
gravitation
is
intensest
of
that
you
are
yet
to
judge
he
replied
when
we
come
to
a
state
of
rest
in
the
stratum
of
greater
gravity
we
will
then
traverse
this
crevice
in
the
sheet
of
energy
until
we
reach
the
edge
of
the
earth
crust
after
which
we
will
ascend
towards
the
interior
of
the
earth
until
we
reach
the
inner
crust
which
is
as
before
explained
a
surface
of
matter
that
lies
conformably
with
the
external
crust
of
the
earth
and
which
is
the
interior
surface
of
the
solid
part
of
the
earth
there
is
a
concave
world
beneath
the
outer
convex
world
i
can
not
comprehend
you
you
speak
of
continuing
our
journey
towards
the
center
of
the
earth
and
at
the
same
time
you
say
that
after
leaving
the
median
circle
we
will
then
ascend
which
seems
contradictory
i
have
endeavored
to
show
you
that
matter
is
resting
in
or
on
a
central
sphere
of
energy
which
attracts
solid
bodies
towards
its
central
plane
from
this
fundamental
and
permanent
seat
of
gravity
we
may
regard
our
progress
as
whether
we
proceed
towards
the
hollow
center
or
towards
the
outer
surface
of
the
globe
if
a
stick
weighted
on
one
end
is
floated
upright
in
water
an
insect
on
the
top
of
the
stick
above
the
water
will
fall
to
the
surface
of
the
liquid
and
yet
the
same
insect
will
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
water
if
liberated
beneath
the
water
at
the
bottom
of
the
stick
this
comparison
is
not
precisely
applicable
to
our
present
position
for
there
is
no
change
in
medium
here
but
it
may
serve
as
an
aid
to
thought
and
may
indicate
to
you
that
which
i
wish
to
convey
when
i
say
ascend
in
both
directions
as
we
pull
against
gravity
the
terms
up
and
down
are
not
absolute
but
relative
thus
we
continued
an
undefined
period
in
mind
conversation
and
of
the
information
gained
in
my
experience
of
that
delightful
condition
i
have
the
privilege
now
to
record
but
a
small
portion
and
even
this
statement
of
facts
appears
as
i
glance
backward
into
my
human
existence
as
if
it
may
seem
to
others
to
border
on
the
incredible
during
all
that
time
i
know
not
how
long
the
period
may
have
been
we
were
alternately
passing
and
repassing
through
the
partition
of
division
the
sphere
of
gravity
that
separated
the
inner
from
the
outer
substantial
crust
of
earth
with
each
vibration
our
line
of
travel
became
shorter
and
shorter
like
the
decreasing
oscillations
of
a
pendulum
and
at
last
i
could
no
longer
perceive
the
rushing
motion
of
a
medium
like
the
air
finally
my
guide
said
that
we
were
at
perfect
rest
at
a
point
in
that
mysterious
medial
sphere
which
at
a
distance
of
about
seven
hundred
miles
below
the
level
of
the
sea
concentrates
in
its
encompassing
curvature
the
mighty
power
of
gravitation
we
were
fixed
seven
hundred
miles
from
the
outer
surface
of
the
globe
but
more
than
three
thousand
from
the
center
chapter
my
weight
tell
me
i
cried
in
alarm
is
this
to
be
a
living
tomb
if
you
will
reflect
upon
the
condition
we
are
now
in
you
will
perceive
that
it
must
be
one
of
unusual
scientific
interest
if
you
imagine
a
body
at
rest
in
an
intangible
medium
and
not
in
contact
with
a
gas
or
any
substance
capable
of
creating
friction
that
body
by
the
prevailing
theory
of
matter
and
motion
unless
disturbed
by
an
impulse
from
without
would
remain
forever
at
absolute
rest
we
now
occupy
such
a
position
in
whatever
direction
we
may
now
be
situated
it
seems
to
us
that
we
are
upright
we
are
absolutely
without
weight
and
in
a
perfectly
frictionless
medium
should
an
inanimate
body
begin
to
revolve
here
it
would
continue
that
motion
forever
if
our
equilibrium
should
now
be
disturbed
and
we
should
begin
to
move
in
a
direction
coinciding
with
the
plane
in
which
we
are
at
rest
we
would
continue
moving
with
the
same
rapidity
in
that
direction
until
our
course
was
arrested
by
some
opposing
object
we
are
not
subject
to
attraction
of
matter
for
at
this
place
gravitation
robs
matter
of
its
gravity
and
has
no
influence
on
extraneous
substances
we
are
now
in
the
center
of
gravitation
the
of
rest
let
me
think
it
out
i
replied
and
reasoning
from
his
remarks
i
mentally
followed
the
chain
to
its
sequence
and
was
startled
as
suddenly
it
dawned
upon
me
that
if
his
argument
was
true
we
must
remain
motionless
in
this
spot
until
death
could
beings
in
conditions
like
ourselves
die
beyond
the
death
we
had
already
achieved
or
the
end
of
time
we
were
at
perfect
rest
in
absolute
vacancy
there
being
as
i
now
accepted
without
reserve
neither
gas
liquid
nor
solid
that
we
could
employ
as
a
lever
to
start
us
into
motion
tell
me
i
cried
in
alarm
is
this
to
be
a
living
tomb
are
we
to
remain
suspended
here
forever
and
if
not
by
what
method
can
we
hope
to
extricate
ourselves
from
this
state
of
perfect
quiescence
he
again
took
the
bar
of
iron
from
my
hand
and
cautiously
gave
it
a
whirling
motion
releasing
it
as
he
did
so
it
revolved
silently
and
rapidly
in
space
without
support
or
pivot
so
it
would
continue
he
remarked
until
the
end
of
time
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
i
could
not
possibly
release
it
in
a
condition
of
absolute
horizontal
rest
there
is
a
slight
slow
lateral
motion
that
will
carry
the
object
parallel
with
this
sheet
of
energy
to
the
material
side
of
this
crevice
when
its
motion
will
arrested
by
the
earth
it
strikes
that
i
can
understand
i
replied
and
then
a
ray
of
light
broke
upon
me
had
not
cavendish
demonstrated
that
when
a
small
ball
of
lead
is
suspended
on
a
film
of
silk
near
a
mass
of
iron
or
lead
it
is
drawn
towards
the
greater
body
we
will
be
drawn
by
gravity
to
the
nearest
cliff
i
cried
you
mistake
he
answered
cavendish
performed
his
experiments
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
there
gravity
is
always
ready
to
start
an
object
into
motion
here
objects
have
no
weight
and
neither
attract
nor
repel
each
other
the
force
of
cohesion
holds
together
substances
that
are
in
contact
but
as
gravitation
can
not
now
affect
matter
out
of
molecular
contact
with
other
forms
of
matter
because
of
the
equilibrium
of
all
objects
so
it
may
be
likewise
said
that
bodies
out
of
contact
have
at
this
point
no
attraction
for
one
another
if
they
possessed
this
attribute
long
ago
we
would
have
been
drawn
towards
the
earth
cliff
with
inconceivable
velocity
however
if
by
any
method
our
bodies
should
receive
an
impulse
sufficient
to
start
them
into
motion
ever
so
gently
though
it
be
we
in
like
manner
would
continue
to
move
in
this
frictionless
medium
until
we
would
strike
the
material
boundary
of
this
crevice
i
interrupted
yes
but
can
you
conceive
of
any
method
by
which
such
voluntary
motion
can
now
be
acquired
no
does
it
not
seem
to
you
he
continued
that
when
skillful
mechanics
on
the
earth
surface
are
able
to
adjust
balances
so
delicately
that
in
the
face
of
friction
of
metal
friction
of
air
inertia
of
mass
the
thousandth
part
of
a
grain
can
produce
motion
of
the
great
beams
and
pans
of
such
balances
we
in
this
location
where
there
is
no
friction
and
no
opposing
medium
none
at
all
should
be
able
to
induce
mass
motion
i
can
not
imagine
how
it
is
possible
unless
we
shove
each
other
apart
there
is
no
other
object
to
push
against
but
why
do
you
continue
to
hold
me
so
tightly
i
interrupted
myself
to
ask
for
he
was
clasping
me
firmly
again
in
order
that
you
may
not
leave
me
he
replied
come
you
trifle
i
said
somewhat
irritated
you
have
just
argued
that
we
are
immovably
suspended
in
a
frictionless
medium
and
fixed
in
our
present
position
you
ask
me
to
suggest
some
method
by
which
we
can
create
motion
and
i
fail
to
devise
it
and
almost
in
the
same
sentence
you
say
that
you
fear
that
i
will
leave
you
cease
your
incongruities
and
advise
with
me
rationally
where
is
the
bar
of
iron
he
asked
i
turned
towards
its
former
location
it
had
disappeared
have
you
not
occasionally
felt
he
asked
that
in
your
former
life
your
mind
was
a
slave
in
an
earthly
prison
have
you
never
especially
in
your
dreams
experienced
a
sensation
of
mental
confinement
yes
know
then
he
replied
that
there
is
a
connection
between
the
mind
and
the
body
of
mortal
beings
in
which
matter
confines
mind
and
yet
mind
governs
matter
how
else
could
the
will
of
men
and
animals
impart
voluntary
motion
to
earthy
bodies
with
beings
situated
as
are
the
animals
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
mind
alone
can
not
overcome
the
friction
of
matter
a
person
could
suspend
himself
accurately
on
a
string
or
balance
himself
on
a
pivot
and
wish
with
the
entire
force
of
his
mind
that
his
body
would
revolve
and
still
he
would
remain
at
perfect
rest
certainly
a
man
would
be
considered
crazy
who
attempted
it
i
answered
notwithstanding
your
opinion
in
time
to
come
human
beings
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
will
investigate
in
this
very
direction
he
replied
and
in
the
proper
time
mental
evolution
will
by
experimentation
prove
the
fact
of
this
mind
and
matter
connection
and
demonstrate
that
even
extraneous
matter
may
be
made
subservient
to
mind
influences
on
earth
mind
acts
on
the
matter
of
one
body
to
produce
motion
of
matter
and
the
spirit
within
which
is
a
slave
to
matter
moves
with
it
contraries
rule
here
mind
force
acts
on
pure
space
motion
moving
itself
and
matter
with
it
and
that
too
without
any
exertion
of
the
material
body
which
now
is
a
nonentity
mind
here
being
the
master
how
can
i
believe
you
i
replied
know
then
he
said
that
we
are
in
motion
now
propelled
by
my
will
power
prove
it
you
may
prove
it
yourself
he
said
but
be
careful
or
we
will
separate
forever
releasing
his
grasp
he
directed
me
to
wish
that
i
were
moving
directly
to
the
right
i
did
so
the
distance
widened
between
us
wish
intensely
that
you
would
move
in
a
circle
about
me
i
acquiesced
and
at
once
my
body
began
to
circle
around
him
call
for
the
bar
of
iron
i
did
as
directed
and
soon
it
came
floating
out
of
space
into
my
very
hand
i
am
amazed
i
ejaculated
yes
more
surprised
at
these
phenomena
than
at
anything
that
has
preceded
you
need
not
be
you
move
now
under
the
influences
of
natural
laws
that
are
no
more
obscure
or
wonderful
than
those
under
which
you
have
always
existed
instead
of
exercising
its
influence
on
a
brain
and
thence
indirectly
on
a
material
body
your
mind
force
is
exerting
its
action
through
energy
on
matter
itself
matter
is
here
subservient
it
is
nearly
the
same
as
vacuity
mind
being
a
comprehensive
reality
the
positions
we
have
heretofore
occupied
have
been
reversed
and
mind
now
dominates
know
that
as
your
body
is
now
absolutely
without
weight
and
is
suspended
in
a
frictionless
medium
the
most
delicate
balance
of
a
chemist
can
not
approach
in
sensitiveness
the
adjustment
herein
exemplified
your
body
does
not
weigh
the
fraction
of
the
millionth
part
of
a
grain
and
where
there
is
neither
material
weight
nor
possible
friction
even
the
attrition
that
on
surface
earth
results
from
a
needle
point
that
rests
on
an
agate
plate
is
immeasurably
greater
in
comparison
pure
mind
energy
is
capable
of
disturbing
the
equilibrium
of
matter
in
our
situation
as
you
have
seen
exemplified
by
our
movements
and
extraneous
materials
matter
obeys
the
spiritual
the
bar
of
iron
obeyed
your
call
the
spiritless
metal
is
subservient
to
the
demands
of
intelligence
but
come
we
must
continue
our
journey
grasping
me
again
he
exclaimed
wish
with
all
intensity
that
we
may
move
forward
and
i
will
do
the
same
i
did
so
we
are
now
uniting
our
energies
in
the
creation
of
motion
he
said
we
are
moving
rapidly
and
with
continually
accelerated
speed
before
long
we
will
perceive
the
earthy
border
of
this
chasm
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
at
perfect
rest
chapter
li
is
that
a
mortal
the
end
of
earth
at
length
i
perceived
in
the
distance
a
ring
of
silver
luster
it
grew
broader
expanding
beneath
my
gaze
and
appeared
to
approach
rapidly
hold
cease
your
desire
for
onward
motion
said
the
guide
we
approach
too
rapidly
quick
wish
with
all
your
mind
that
you
were
motionless
i
did
so
and
we
rested
in
front
of
a
ridge
of
brilliant
material
that
in
one
direction
towards
the
earth
outer
circle
broadened
until
it
extended
upward
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
the
form
of
a
bold
precipice
and
in
the
other
towards
the
inner
world
shelved
gradually
away
as
an
ocean
beach
might
do
tell
me
what
is
this
barrier
i
asked
it
is
the
bisected
edge
of
the
earth
crevice
he
said
that
overhanging
upright
bluff
reaches
towards
the
external
surface
of
the
earth
the
land
of
your
former
home
that
shelving
approach
beneath
is
the
entrance
to
the
circle
the
concavity
of
our
world
again
we
approached
the
visible
substance
moving
gently
under
the
will
of
my
guide
the
shore
became
more
distinctly
outlined
as
we
advanced
inequalities
that
were
before
unnoticed
became
perceptible
and
the
material
resolved
itself
into
ordinary
earth
then
i
observed
upright
and
motionless
on
the
edge
of
the
shore
that
reached
toward
the
inner
shell
of
earth
towards
that
unknown
country
beyond
a
figure
in
human
form
is
that
a
mortal
i
asked
are
we
nearing
humanity
again
it
is
a
being
of
mortal
build
a
messenger
who
awaits
our
coming
and
who
is
to
take
charge
of
your
person
and
conduct
you
farther
he
replied
it
has
been
my
duty
to
crush
to
overcome
by
successive
lessons
your
obedience
to
your
dogmatic
materialistic
earth
philosophy
and
bring
your
mind
to
comprehend
that
life
on
earth
surface
is
only
a
step
towards
a
brighter
existence
which
may
when
selfishness
is
conquered
in
a
time
to
come
be
gained
by
mortal
man
and
while
he
is
in
the
flesh
the
vicissitudes
through
which
you
have
recently
passed
should
be
to
you
an
impressive
lesson
but
the
future
holds
for
you
a
lesson
far
more
important
the
knowledge
of
spiritual
or
mental
evolution
which
men
may
yet
approach
but
that
i
would
not
presume
to
indicate
now
even
to
you
your
earthly
body
has
become
a
useless
shell
and
when
you
lay
it
aside
as
you
soon
can
do
as
i
may
say
you
are
destined
to
do
you
will
feel
a
relief
as
if
an
abnormal
excrescence
had
been
removed
but
you
can
not
now
comprehend
such
a
condition
that
change
will
not
occur
until
you
have
been
further
educated
in
the
purely
occult
secrets
for
which
i
have
partly
prepared
you
and
the
material
part
of
your
organism
will
at
any
time
thereafter
come
and
go
at
command
of
your
will
on
that
adjacent
shore
the
person
you
have
observed
your
next
teacher
awaits
you
am
i
to
leave
you
i
cried
in
despair
for
suddenly
the
remembrance
of
home
came
into
my
mind
and
the
thought
as
by
a
flash
that
this
being
alone
could
guide
me
back
to
earth
recall
your
words
do
not
desert
me
now
after
leading
me
beyond
even
alchemistic
imaginings
into
this
subterranean
existence
the
result
of
what
you
call
your
natural
or
pure
ethereal
lessons
he
shook
his
head
i
beg
of
you
i
implore
of
you
not
to
abandon
me
now
have
you
no
compassion
no
feeling
you
are
the
one
tie
that
binds
me
to
earth
proper
the
only
intelligence
that
i
know
to
be
related
to
a
human
in
all
this
great
bright
blank
again
he
shook
his
head
illustration
suspended
in
vacancy
he
seemed
to
float
hearken
to
my
pleadings
listen
to
my
allegation
you
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
brook
spring
in
kentucky
your
back
to
the
darkness
of
that
gloomy
cavern
and
i
voluntarily
gave
you
my
hand
as
to
a
guide
i
turned
from
the
verdure
of
the
earth
the
sunshine
of
the
past
and
accompanied
you
into
as
dismal
a
cavern
as
man
ever
entered
i
have
since
alternately
rebelled
at
your
methods
and
again
have
trusted
you
implicitly
as
we
passed
through
scenes
that
rational
imagination
scarce
could
conjure
i
have
successively
lost
my
voice
my
weight
my
breath
my
heart
throb
and
my
soul
for
aught
i
know
now
an
unknown
future
awaits
me
on
the
one
hand
in
which
you
say
my
body
is
to
disappear
and
on
the
other
you
are
standing
the
only
link
between
earth
and
my
a
it
may
be
to
speak
mildly
for
god
only
knows
your
true
rank
in
life
scale
be
you
man
or
not
you
brought
me
here
and
are
responsible
for
my
future
safety
i
plead
and
beg
of
you
either
to
go
on
with
me
into
the
forthcoming
uncertainty
the
unknown
country
to
which
you
allude
or
carry
me
back
to
upper
earth
he
shook
his
head
again
and
motioned
me
onward
and
his
powerful
will
overcoming
my
feeble
resistance
impelled
me
towards
that
mysterious
shore
i
floated
helpless
as
a
fragment
of
camphor
whirls
and
spins
on
a
surface
of
clear
warm
water
spinning
and
whirling
aimlessly
about
but
moving
onward
my
feet
rested
on
solid
earth
and
i
awkwardly
struggled
a
short
distance
onward
and
upward
and
then
stepped
upon
the
slope
that
reached
as
he
had
said
inward
and
upward
towards
the
unrevealed
inner
circle
i
had
entered
now
that
mysterious
third
circle
or
sphere
and
i
stood
on
the
very
edge
of
the
wonderful
land
i
was
destined
to
explore
the
unknown
country
the
strange
peaceful
being
whom
i
had
observed
on
the
shore
stepped
to
my
side
and
clasped
both
my
hands
and
the
guide
of
former
days
waved
me
an
adieu
i
sank
upon
my
knees
and
imploringly
raised
my
arms
in
supplication
but
the
comrade
of
my
journey
turned
about
and
began
to
retrace
his
course
suspended
in
vacancy
he
seemed
to
float
as
a
spirit
would
if
it
were
wafted
diagonally
into
the
heavens
and
acquiring
momentum
rapidly
became
quickly
a
bright
speck
seemingly
a
silver
mote
in
the
occult
earth
shine
of
that
central
sphere
and
soon
vanished
from
view
in
all
my
past
eventful
history
there
was
nothing
similar
to
or
approaching
in
keenness
the
agony
that
i
suffered
at
this
moment
and
i
question
if
shipwrecked
sailor
or
entombed
miner
ever
experienced
the
sense
of
utter
desolation
that
now
possessed
and
overcame
me
light
everywhere
about
me
light
but
darkness
within
darkness
indescribable
and
mental
distress
unutterable
i
fell
upon
my
face
in
agony
and
thought
of
other
times
and
those
remembrances
of
my
once
happy
upper
earth
life
became
excruciatingly
painful
for
when
a
person
is
in
misery
pleasant
recollections
by
contrast
increase
the
pain
let
my
soul
die
now
as
my
body
has
done
i
moaned
for
even
mental
life
all
i
now
possess
is
a
burden
the
past
to
me
is
a
painful
melancholy
recollection
the
future
is
i
shuddered
for
who
could
foretell
my
future
i
glanced
at
the
immovable
being
with
the
sweet
mild
countenance
who
stood
silent
on
the
strand
beside
me
and
whom
i
shall
not
now
attempt
to
describe
he
replied
the
future
is
operative
and
speculative
it
leads
the
contemplative
to
view
with
reverence
and
admiration
the
glorious
works
of
the
creator
and
inspires
him
with
the
most
exalted
ideas
of
the
perfections
of
his
divine
creator
then
he
added
have
you
accepted
that
whatever
seems
to
be
is
not
and
that
that
which
seems
not
to
be
is
have
you
learned
that
facts
are
fallacies
and
physical
existence
a
delusion
do
you
accept
that
material
bliss
is
impossible
and
that
while
humanity
is
working
towards
the
undiscovered
land
man
is
not
can
not
be
satisfied
yes
i
said
i
admit
anything
everything
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
here
or
that
you
are
there
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
ever
been
or
that
any
form
of
matter
has
ever
had
an
existence
perhaps
material
things
are
not
perhaps
vacuity
only
is
tangible
are
you
willing
to
relinquish
your
former
associations
to
cease
to
concern
yourself
in
the
affairs
of
men
do
you
he
hesitated
seemed
to
consider
a
point
that
i
could
not
grasp
then
without
completing
his
sentence
or
waiting
for
me
to
answer
added
come
my
friend
let
us
enter
the
expanses
of
the
unknown
country
you
will
soon
behold
the
original
of
your
vision
the
hope
of
humanity
and
will
rest
in
the
land
of
etidorhpa
come
my
friend
let
us
hasten
arm
in
arm
we
passed
into
that
domain
of
peace
and
tranquillity
and
as
i
stepped
onward
and
upward
perfect
rest
came
over
my
troubled
spirit
all
thoughts
of
former
times
vanished
the
cares
of
life
faded
misery
distress
hatred
envy
jealousy
and
unholy
passions
were
blotted
from
existence
excepting
my
love
for
dear
ones
still
and
the
strand
of
sorrow
that
stretching
from
soul
to
soul
linked
us
together
the
past
became
a
blank
i
had
reached
the
land
of
etidorhpa
the
end
of
earth
interlude
chapter
lii
the
last
farewell
my
mysterious
guest
he
of
the
silver
flowing
beard
read
the
last
word
of
the
foregoing
manuscript
and
then
laid
the
sheet
of
paper
on
the
table
and
rested
his
head
upon
his
hand
gazing
thoughtfully
at
the
open
fire
thus
he
sat
for
a
considerable
period
in
silence
then
he
said
you
have
heard
part
of
my
story
that
portion
which
i
am
commanded
to
make
known
now
and
you
have
learned
how
by
natural
methods
i
passed
by
successive
steps
while
in
the
body
to
the
door
that
death
only
as
yet
opens
to
humanity
you
understand
also
that
although
of
human
form
i
am
not
as
other
men
for
with
me
matter
is
subservient
to
mind
and
as
you
have
promised
so
you
must
act
and
do
my
bidding
concerning
the
manuscript
but
there
is
surely
more
to
follow
you
will
tell
me
of
what
you
saw
and
experienced
beyond
the
end
of
earth
within
the
possessions
of
etidorhpa
tell
me
of
that
unknown
country
no
he
answered
this
is
the
end
at
least
so
far
as
my
connection
with
you
is
concerned
you
still
question
certain
portions
of
my
narrative
i
perceive
notwithstanding
the
provings
i
have
given
you
and
yet
as
time
passes
investigation
will
show
that
every
word
i
have
read
or
uttered
is
true
historically
philosophically
and
spiritually
which
you
now
doubt
and
men
will
yet
readily
understand
how
the
seemingly
profound
unfathomable
phenomena
i
have
encountered
may
be
verified
i
have
studied
and
learned
by
bitter
experience
in
a
school
that
teaches
from
the
outgoings
of
a
deeper
philosophy
than
human
science
has
reached
especially
modern
materialistic
science
which
however
step
by
step
it
is
destined
to
reach
and
yet
i
have
recorded
but
a
small
part
of
the
experiences
that
i
have
undergone
what
i
have
related
is
only
a
foretaste
of
the
inexhaustible
feast
which
in
the
wisdom
expanse
of
the
future
will
yet
be
spread
before
man
and
which
tempts
him
onward
and
upward
this
narrative
which
rests
against
the
beginning
of
my
real
story
the
unknown
country
and
its
possibilities
should
therefore
incite
to
renewed
exertions
both
mental
and
experimental
those
permitted
to
review
it
i
have
carried
my
history
to
the
point
at
which
i
can
say
to
you
very
soon
afterward
i
gave
up
my
body
temporarily
by
a
perfectly
natural
process
a
method
that
man
can
yet
employ
and
passed
as
a
spiritual
being
into
the
ethereal
spaces
through
those
many
mansions
which
i
am
not
permitted
to
describe
at
this
time
and
from
which
i
have
been
forced
unwillingly
to
return
and
take
up
the
semblance
of
my
body
in
order
to
meet
you
and
record
these
events
i
must
await
the
development
and
expansion
of
mind
that
will
permit
men
to
accept
this
faithful
record
of
my
history
before
completing
the
narrative
for
men
are
yet
unprepared
men
must
seriously
consider
those
truths
which
under
inflexible
natural
laws
govern
the
destiny
of
man
but
which
if
mentioned
at
this
day
can
only
be
viewed
as
the
hallucinations
of
a
disordered
mind
to
many
this
manuscript
will
prove
a
passing
romance
to
others
an
enigma
to
others
still
it
will
be
a
pleasing
study
men
are
not
now
in
a
condition
to
receive
even
this
paper
that
fact
i
know
full
well
and
i
have
accordingly
arranged
that
thirty
years
shall
pass
before
it
is
made
public
then
they
will
have
begun
to
study
more
deeply
into
force
disturbances
exhibitions
of
energy
that
are
now
known
and
called
imponderable
bodies
perhaps
some
of
my
statements
will
then
even
be
verified
and
to
reflect
over
the
connection
of
matter
therewith
a
few
minds
will
then
be
capable
of
vaguely
conceiving
possibilities
which
this
paper
will
serve
to
foretell
for
a
true
solution
of
the
great
problems
of
the
ethereal
unknown
is
herein
suggested
the
study
of
which
will
lead
to
a
final
elevation
of
humanity
such
as
i
dare
not
prophesy
much
of
the
paper
is
obscure
to
me
i
said
and
there
are
occasional
phrases
and
repetitions
that
appear
to
be
interjected
possibly
with
an
object
and
which
are
yet
disconnected
from
the
narrative
proper
that
is
true
the
paper
often
contains
statements
that
are
emblematical
and
which
you
can
not
understand
but
yet
such
portions
carry
to
others
a
hidden
meaning
i
am
directed
to
speak
to
many
persons
besides
yourself
and
i
can
not
meet
those
whom
i
address
more
directly
than
i
do
through
this
communication
these
pages
will
serve
to
instruct
many
people
people
whom
you
will
never
know
to
whom
i
have
brought
messages
that
will
in
secret
be
read
between
the
lines
why
not
give
it
to
such
persons
because
i
am
directed
to
bring
it
to
you
he
replied
and
you
are
required
first
to
seal
the
manuscript
and
place
it
in
the
inner
vault
of
your
safe
second
to
draw
up
a
will
and
provide
in
case
of
your
death
that
after
the
expiration
of
thirty
years
from
this
date
the
seals
are
to
be
broken
and
a
limited
edition
published
in
book
form
by
one
you
select
third
an
artist
capable
of
grasping
the
conceptions
will
at
the
proper
time
be
found
to
whom
the
responsibility
of
illustrating
the
volume
is
to
be
entrusted
he
receiving
credit
therefor
only
himself
and
yourself
or
your
selected
agent
are
to
presume
to
select
the
subjects
for
illustration
fourth
in
case
you
are
in
this
city
upon
the
expiration
of
thirty
years
you
are
to
open
the
package
and
follow
the
directions
given
in
the
envelope
therein
and
he
then
placed
on
the
manuscript
a
sealed
envelope
addressed
to
myself
this
i
have
promised
already
i
said
very
well
he
remarked
i
will
bid
you
farewell
wait
a
moment
it
is
unjust
to
leave
the
narrative
thus
uncompleted
you
have
been
promised
a
future
in
comparison
with
which
the
experiences
you
have
undergone
and
have
related
to
me
were
tame
you
had
just
met
on
the
edge
of
the
inner
circle
that
mysterious
being
concerning
whom
i
am
deeply
interested
as
i
am
in
the
continuation
of
your
personal
narrative
and
you
have
evidently
more
to
relate
for
you
must
have
passed
into
that
unknown
country
you
claim
to
have
done
so
but
you
break
the
thread
in
the
most
attractive
part
by
leaving
the
future
to
conjecture
it
must
be
so
this
is
a
history
of
man
on
earth
the
continuation
will
be
a
history
of
man
within
the
unknown
country
and
i
am
not
to
receive
the
remainder
of
your
story
i
reiterated
still
loth
to
give
it
up
no
i
shall
not
appear
directly
to
you
again
your
part
in
this
work
will
have
ended
when
after
thirty
years
you
carry
out
the
directions
given
in
the
sealed
letter
which
with
this
manuscript
i
entrust
to
your
care
i
must
return
now
to
the
shore
that
separated
me
from
my
former
guide
and
having
again
laid
down
this
semblance
of
a
body
go
once
more
into
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
sobbed
yes
this
strange
cynical
being
whom
i
had
at
first
considered
an
impertinent
fanatic
and
then
more
than
once
afterward
had
been
induced
to
view
as
a
cunning
impostor
or
to
fear
as
a
cold
sobbed
like
a
child
it
is
too
much
he
said
seemingly
speaking
to
himself
too
much
to
require
of
one
not
yet
immortal
for
the
good
of
his
race
i
am
again
with
men
nearly
a
human
and
i
long
to
go
back
once
more
to
my
old
home
my
wife
my
children
why
am
i
forbidden
the
sweets
of
paradise
can
not
comfort
the
mortal
who
must
give
up
his
home
and
family
and
yet
carry
his
beyond
man
can
not
possess
unalloyed
joys
and
blessings
spiritual
and
retain
one
backward
longing
for
mundane
subjects
and
i
now
yearn
again
for
my
earth
love
my
material
family
having
tasted
of
pleasures
in
one
of
the
mansions
of
that
complacent
pure
and
restful
sphere
i
now
exist
in
the
border
land
but
my
earth
home
is
not
relinquished
i
cling
as
a
mortal
to
former
scenes
and
crave
to
meet
my
lost
loved
ones
all
of
earth
must
be
left
behind
if
paradise
is
ever
wholly
gained
yet
i
have
still
my
sublunary
thoughts
etidorhpa
etidorhpa
he
pleaded
turning
his
eyes
as
if
towards
one
i
could
not
see
etidorhpa
my
old
home
calls
thou
knowest
that
the
beginning
of
man
on
earth
is
a
cry
born
of
love
and
the
end
of
man
on
earth
is
a
cry
for
love
love
is
a
gift
of
etidorhpa
and
thou
etidorhpa
the
soul
of
love
should
have
compassion
on
a
pleading
mortal
he
raised
his
hands
in
supplication
have
mercy
on
me
etidorhpa
as
i
would
on
you
if
you
were
i
and
i
were
etidorhpa
then
with
upturned
face
he
stood
long
and
silent
listening
ah
he
murmured
at
last
as
if
in
reply
to
a
voice
i
could
not
catch
a
voice
that
carried
to
his
ear
an
answer
of
deep
disappointment
thou
spokest
truly
in
the
vision
etidorhpa
it
is
love
that
enslaves
mankind
love
that
commands
love
that
ensnares
and
rules
mankind
and
thou
etidorhpa
art
the
soul
of
love
true
it
is
that
were
there
no
etidorhpa
there
would
still
be
tears
on
earth
but
the
cold
meaningless
tears
of
pain
only
no
mourning
people
no
sorrowful
partings
no
sobbing
mothers
kneeling
with
upturned
faces
no
planting
of
the
myrtle
and
the
rose
on
sacred
graves
there
would
be
no
no
home
no
tomb
no
sorrow
no
beyond
he
hesitated
sank
upon
his
knees
pleadingly
raised
his
clasped
hands
and
seemed
to
listen
to
that
voice
then
bowed
his
head
and
answered
yes
thou
art
right
etidorhpa
although
thou
bringest
sorrow
to
mortals
without
thee
and
this
there
could
be
no
bright
hereafter
thou
art
just
etidorhpa
and
always
wise
love
is
the
seed
and
sorrow
is
the
harvest
but
this
harvest
of
sadness
is
to
man
the
richest
gift
of
love
the
golden
link
that
joins
the
spirit
form
that
has
fled
to
the
spirit
that
is
still
enthralled
on
earth
were
there
no
there
could
be

if

should
convince
you

related
a

in

me
that
you
will
do
your

a

illustration
i
stood
alone
in
my
room
holding
the
mysterious
manuscript
this
i
will
surely
do
what
shall
it
be
i
left
a
wife
a
little
babe
and
a
child
when
i
was
taken
away
abducted
in
the
manner
that
i
have
faithfully
recorded
in
my
subsequent
experience
i
have
not
been
able
to
cast
them
from
my
memory
i
know
that
through
my
error
they
have
been
lost
to
me
and
will
be
until
they
change
to
the
spirit
after
which
we
will
meet
again
in
one
of
the
waiting
mansions
of
the
great
beyond
i
beg
you
to
ascertain
if
possible
if
either
my
children
or
my
children
children
live
and
should
they
be
in
want
present
them
with
a
substantial
testimonial
now
farewell
he
held
out
his
hand
i
grasped
it
and
as
i
did
so
his
form
became
indistinct
and
gradually
disappeared
from
my
gaze
the
fingers
of
my
hand
met
the
palm
in
vacancy
and
with
extended
arms
i
stood
alone
in
my
room
holding
the
mysterious
manuscript
on
the
back
of
which
i
find
plainly
engrossed
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth

than
are

llewellyn

now
break
the
seals
and
open
the
envelope

the

a

you
are

to
have
engraved
and
to
use
as
a
frontispiece
to
the
volume
there
are
men
yet
living
to
bear
witness
to
my
identity
who
will
need
but
this
picture
to
convince
them
of
the
authenticity
of
the
statements
in
the
manuscript
as
it
is
the
face
of
one
they
knew
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
will
recognize
now
that
he
is
in
age
do
not
concern
yourself
about
the
reception
of
the
work
for
you
are
in
no
wise
responsible
for
its
statements
interested
persons
if
living
will
not
care
to
appear
in
public
in
connection
therewith
and
those
who
grasp
and
appreciate
who
can
see
the
pertinence
of
its
truths
who
can
read
between
the
lines
and
have
the
key
to
connected
conditions
will
assuredly
keep
their
knowledge
of
these
facts
locked
in
their
own
bosoms
or
insidiously
oppose
them
and
by
their
silence
or
their
attacks
cover
from
men
outside
the
fraternity
their
connection
with
the
unfortunate
author
they
dare
not
speak
revise
the
sentences
secure
the
services
of
an
editor
if
you
desire
and
induce
another
to
publish
the
book
if
you
shrink
from
the
responsibility
but
in
your
revision
do
not
in
any
way
alter
the
meaning
of
the
statements
made
in
the
manuscript
have
it
copied
for
the
printer
and
take
no
part
in
comments
that
may
arise
among
men
concerning
its
reception
those
who
are
best
informed
regarding
certain
portions
thereof
will
seemingly
be
least
interested
in
the
book
and
those
who
realize
most
fully
these
truths
will
persistently
evade
the
endorsement
of
them
the
scientific
enthusiast
like
the
fraternity
to
which
i
belong
if
appealed
to
will
obstruct
the
mind
of
the
student
either
by
criticism
or
ridicule
for
many
of
these
revelations
are
not
recorded
in
his
books
from
a
review
of
the
fac
simile
see
it
will
be
seen
that
an
exact
print
word
for
word
could
not
be
expected
in
more
than
one
instance
subsequent
study
demonstrated
that
the
first
conception
was
erroneous
and
in
the
interview
with
etidorhpa
see
after
the
page
had
been
plated
it
was
discovered
that
the
conveyed
meaning
was
exactly
the
reverse
of
the
original
luckily
the
error
was
discovered
in
time
to
change
the
verse
and
leave
the
spirit
of
this
fair
creature
j
you
are
at
liberty
to
give
in
your
own
language
as
a
prologue
the
history
of
your
connection
with
the
author
reserving
however
if
you
desire
to
do
so
your
personality
adding
an
introduction
to
the
manuscript
and
as
interludes
every
detail
of
our
several
conversations
and
of
your
experience
introduce
such
illustrations
as
the
selected
artist
and
yourself
think
proper
in
order
to
illuminate
the
statements
do
not
question
the
advisability
of
stating
all
that
you
know
to
have
occurred
write
the
whole
truth
for
although
mankind
will
not
now
accept
as
fact
all
that
you
and
i
have
experienced
strange
phases
of
life
phenomena
are
revealing
themselves
and
humanity
will
yet
surely
be
led
to
a
higher
plane
as
men
investigate
the
points
of
historical
interest
and
the
phenomena
broached
in
this
narrative
the
curtain
of
obscurity
will
be
drawn
aside
and
evidence
of
the
truths
contained
in
these
details
will
be
disclosed
finally
you
must
mutilate
a
page
of
the
manuscript
that
you
may
select
and
preserve
the
fragment
intact
and
in
secret
do
not
print
another
edition
unless
you
are
presented
with
the
words
of
the
part
that
is
missing
i
have
excised
a
portion
see
p
j
l
signed
i
am
the
man
note
by
mr
thus
the
letter
ended
after
mature
consideration
it
has
been
decided
to
give
verbatim
most
of
the
letter
and
all
of
the
manuscript
and
to
append
as
a
prologue
an
introduction
to
the
manuscript
detailing
exactly
the
record
of
my
connection
therewith
including
my
arguments
with
professors
chickering
and
vaughn
whom
i
consulted
concerning
the
statements
made
to
me
directly
by
its
author
i
will
admit
that
perhaps
the
opening
chapter
in
my
introduction
may
be
such
as
to
raise
in
the
minds
of
some
persons
a
question
concerning
my
mental
responsibility
for
as
the
principal
personage
in
this
drama
remarks
mankind
can
not
now
accept
as
facts
what
i
have
seen
yet
i
walk
the
streets
of
my
native
city
a
business
man
of
recognized
thoughtfulness
and
sobriety
and
i
only
relate
on
my
own
responsibility
what
has
to
my
knowledge
occurred
it
has
never
been
intimated
that
i
am
mentally
irresponsible
or
speculative
and
even
were
this
the
case
the
material
proof
that
i
hold
and
have
not
mentioned
as
yet
and
may
not
concerning
my
relations
with
this
remarkable
being
effectually
disproves
the
idea
of
mental
aberration
or
spectral
delusion
besides
many
of
the
statements
are
of
such
a
nature
as
to
be
verified
easily
or
disproved
by
any
person
who
may
be
inclined
to
repeat
the
experiments
suggested
or
visit
the
localities
mentioned
the
part
of
the
whole
production
that
will
seem
the
most
improbable
to
the
majority
of
persons
is
that
to
which
i
can
testify
from
my
own
knowledge
as
related
in
the
first
portion
and
the
closing
chapter
this
approaches
necromancy
seemingly
and
yet
in
my
opinion
as
i
now
see
the
matter
such
unexplained
and
recondite
occurrences
appear
unscientific
because
of
the
shortcomings
of
students
of
science
occult
phenomena
at
some
future
day
will
be
proved
to
be
based
on
ordinary
physical
conditions
to
be
disclosed
by
scientific
investigations
for
all
that
is
is
natural
and
science
embraces
all
things
but
at
present
they
are
beyond
our
perception
yes
beyond
our
conception
whether
i
have
been
mesmerized
or
have
written
in
a
trance
whether
i
have
been
the
subject
of
mental
aberration
or
have
faithfully
given
a
life
history
to
the
world
whether
this
book
is
altogether
romance
or
carries
a
vein
of
prophecy
whether
it
sets
in
motion
a
train
of
wild
speculations
or
combines
playful
arguments
science
problems
and
metaphysical
reasonings
useful
as
well
as
entertaining
remains
for
the
reader
to
determine
so
far
as

a
paper
read
before
the
literary
club
by
richard
nelson
few
men
if
any
so
eminent
in
science
and
philosophy
have
been
known
to
live
and
die
in
such
obscurity
as
the
subject
of
this
paper
a
mathematician
whose
knowledge
has
never
been
fathomed
an
original
investigator
in
terrestrial
and
celestial
chemistry
most
of
whose
speculations
are
now
accepted
as
law
a
contributor
to
the
philosophical
journals
of
europe
whose
papers
were
received
with
distinguished
favor
an
astronomer
who
in
those
papers
ventured
to
differ
with
laplace
and
too
as
will
be
shown
a
man
skilled
in
classical
scholarship
yet
unknown
to
his
nearest
neighbors
and
recognized
by
only
a
few
in
his
own
city
he
lived
and
died
in
obscurity
and
poverty
in
a
city
distinguished
for
its
schools
of
science
and
art
and
the
liberality
and
public
spirit
of
its
men
of
wealth
who
if
any
were
to
blame
one
object
of
this
paper
is
to
unravel
the
mystery
his
birthplace
and
parentage
daniel
vaughn
was
born
in
the
year
at
glenomara
four
miles
from
killaloe
county
clare
ireland
his
father
name
was
john
who
had
two
brothers
daniel
and
patrick
john
like
daniel
was
educated
for
the
church
but
being
the
eldest
son
remained
on
the
farm
daniel
became
subsequently
the
parish
priest
of
killaloe
and
in
was
ordained
bishop
john
vaughn
had
three
children
daniel
the
subject
of
this
paper
owen
and
margaret
afterward
kent
the
distance
to
the
nearest
school
being
four
irish
miles
john
had
his
sons
educated
by
a
tutor
till
they
were
prepared
to
enter
a
classical
academy
at
the
age
of
about
sixteen
dan
as
he
was
familiarly
called
was
placed
under
the
care
of
his
uncle
and
namesake
at
killaloe
where
he
entered
the
academy
there
the
young
student
pursued
the
study
of
greek
latin
and
mathematics
giving
some
attention
to
certain
branches
of
physics
for
which
he
evinced
peculiar
aptitude
he
emigrates
and
finds
a
home
about
the
year
his
uncle
desirous
of
having
the
young
man
enter
the
church
advanced
him
a
sum
of
money
to
defray
his
expenses
at
a
theological
school
in
cork
but
on
seeing
the
american
liners
when
he
reached
queenstown
the
temptation
to
take
the
voyage
to
the
land
of
promise
was
too
great
for
the
young
adventurer
to
resist
so
he
secured
a
passage
to
new
york
when
at
school
he
made
wonderful
advancement
in
study
especially
in
higher
mathematics
and
felt
he
ought
to
go
to
a
country
where
he
could
be
free
to
pursue
his
favorite
line
of
thought
and
where
attainments
in
science
would
not
be
circumscribed
as
in
the
church
of
his
voyage
and
subsequent
wanderings
little
is
known
until
he
reached
kentucky
that
he
visited
many
schools
and
paid
his
way
in
part
by
teaching
there
is
no
question
the
college
of
the
late
campbell
in
virginia
was
one
of
the
institutions
visited
but
he
felt
he
must
push
on
to
kentucky
about
he
had
reached
the
blue
grass
region
near
the
home
of
the
late
colonel
stamps
in
bourbon
county
the
colonel
saw
him
engaged
at
work
and
was
quick
to
observe
that
the
stranger
was
no
common
man
taking
him
to
his
house
and
supplying
his
wants
the
colonel
soon
installed
him
as
his
guest
and
eventually
made
him
instructor
of
his
children
access
to
the
colonel
library
was
a
boon
to
the
stranger
developing
in
him
traits
of
genius
of
which
his
host
was
very
proud
it
was
only
a
short
time
till
the
neighboring
farmers
heard
of
the
distinguished
young
scholar
and
desired
to
have
the
more
mature
members
of
their
families
under
his
care
a
school
was
opened
in
the
house
for
instruction
in
the
higher
mathematics
the
classics
geology
physical
geography
and
astronomy
the
young
people
were
pleased
with
their
teacher
and
made
commendable
progress
but
the
curriculum
was
too
varied
and
comprehensive
for
an
instructor
who
though
far
advanced
in
scholarship
had
not
yet
studied
the
art
of
teaching
accepts
a
professorship
in
he
accepted
the
chair
of
greek
in
a
neighboring
college
which
afforded
him
leisure
for
his
scientific
pursuits
after
an
absence
of
seven
years
the
professor
returned
to
his
old
friend
colonel
stamps
and
family
where
he
remained
some
two
years
leaving
them
to
settle
in
cincinnati
during
his
stay
at
the
colonel
he
became
a
member
of
the
american
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
and
in
contributed
to
it
his
first
article
entitled
on
the
motions
of
numerous
small
bodies
and
the
phenomena
resulting
therefrom
having
accumulated
a
valuable
collection
of
books
on
science
and
philosophy
and
obtained
access
to
several
libraries
public
and
private
in
the
city
he
was
now
in
a
condition
to
devote
most
of
his
time
and
energies
to
his
favorite
sciences
for
subsistence
he
delivered
lectures
before
teachers
institutes
and
colleges
till
when
an
affection
of
the
lungs
compelled
him
to
abandon
the
lecture
field
in
the
meantime
he
had
offered
papers
for
publication
to
journal
the
principal
scientific
magazine
of
america
at
that
time
but
receiving
no
response
to
his
communications
and
being
denied
publication
he
took
the
advice
of
a
friend
and
sent
his
subsequent
articles
to
the
british
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
and
to
the
philosophic
magazine
where
they
were
received
with
favor
he
was
much
gratified
to
find
his
article
on
meteoric
astronomy
published
in
the
report
of
the
liverpool
meeting
of
the
association
in
six
papers
which
he
subsequently
sent
in
and
met
with
similar
favor
for
several
years
he
visited
schools
colleges
and
teachers
institutes
in
oxford
lebanon
cleveland
and
other
cities
lecturing
on
his
favorite
branches
of
science
it
had
been
his
intention
to
popularize
the
science
of
physical
astronomy
by
the
publication
of
tracts
or
pamphlets
publishes
pamphlets
in
the
year
at
the
request
of
teachers
before
whom
he
had
lectured
at
the
institutes
and
with
a
view
to
popularize
scientific
knowledge
the
professor
commenced
the
publication
of
pamphlets
the
first
number
treated
of
the
geological
agency
of
water
and
subterranean
forces
only
two
of
these
pamphlets
came
into
the
possession
of
the
administrator
one
of
them
was
a
volume
as
may
be
inferred
from
the
following
articles
it
contained
the
influence
of
magnitude
on
stability
the
doctrine
of
gravitation
theory
of
tides
effects
of
tides
cases
of
excessive
tidal
action
and
planetary
instability
the
rings
of
saturn
the
supposed
influence
of
satellites
in
preserving
planetary
rings
movements

but
as
he
failed
to
retain
copies
of

or
of

magazines
in
which
they
were
published
doubtless
many
papers
of
interest
are
among
the
number
the
year
found
the
professor
possessed
of
a
valuable
collection
of
books
the
accumulation
of
ten
or
fifteen
years
all
showing
the
marks
of
wear
some
of
them
besmeared
with
the
drippings
from
his
candle
among
them
were
works
of
some
of
the
most
prominent
authors
in
branches
of
theoretical
and
practical
science
those
of
laplace
kepler
leibnitz
herschel
newton
and
others
together
with
many
pamphlets
and
periodicals
composed
his
library
he
possessed
a
familiar
knowledge
of
the
german
french
italian
and
spanish
languages
and
of
ancient
greek
and
latin
many
of
his
papers
appeared
in
the
continental
languages
it
may
be
here
stated
that
for
the
eminent
astronomer
laplace
as
a
scientist
and
writer
vaughn
entertained
great
respect
though
he
could
not
accept
his
nebular
hypothesis
because
important
parts
of
it
would
not
bear
mathematical
investigation
the
proof
is
in
the
papers
in
my
n
in
an
article
of
the
professor
to
the
popular
science
monthly
february
is
a
case
of
the
kind
showing
that
the
distinguished
astronomer
ignored
his
own
famous
theory
the
article
reads
in
endeavoring
to
account
for
the
direct
motion
in
secondary
systems
laplace
contends
that
in
consequence
of
friction
the
supposed
primitive
solar
rings
would
have
a
greater
velocity
in
their
outer
than
in
their
inner
zones
now
if
friction
is
to
counteract
to
such
an
extent
the
normal
effects
of
gravitation
it
must
be
an
eternal
bar
against
the
origin
of
worlds
by
nebulous
dismemberment
and
if
the
ring
of
attenuated
matter
were
placed
under
the
circumstances
suggested
by
the
eminent
astronomer
it
would
be
ultimately
doomed
not
to
form
a
planet
but
to
coalesce
with
the
immense
spheroid
of
fiery
vapor
it
was
supposed
to
have
environed
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
the
theory
of
our
professor
was
the
correct
one
as
proved
by
a
recent
discovery
of
james
keeler
astronomer
of
the
allegheny
observatory
as
announced
in
a
daily
paper
james
keeler
of
the
allegheny
observatory
has
made
a
wonderful
discovery
it
is
a
scientific
and
positive
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
the
rings
of
saturn
are
made
up
of
many
small
bodies
and
that
the
satellites
of
the
inner
edge
of
the
rings
move
faster
than
the
outer
as
to
satellites
vaughn
in
the
paper
quoted
page
states
the
matter
spread
over
the
wide
annular
fields
is
ever
urged
by
its
own
attraction
to
collect
together
and
form
satellites
which
are
ever
destroyed
by
attractive
disturbance
of
the
primary
and
have
their
parts
scattered
once
more
over
a
wide
space
installed
as
professor
of
chemistry
the
professor
was
elected
to
the
chair
of
chemistry
in
the
cincinnati
college
of
medicine
and
surgery
in
where
he
served
with
distinction
for
twelve
years
his
scholarly
valedictory
at
that
institution
is
one
of
the
papers
reserved
for
publication
in
his
memoirs
while
in
the
college
he
continued
his
investigations
in
science
applying
his
knowledge
of
terrestrial
chemistry
to
the
chemistry
of
the
heavens
as
shown
in
nearly
all
his
writings
besides
the
position
held
in
the
college
he
gave
lessons
in
schools
and
seminaries
in
geology
astronomy
chemistry
latin
and
greek
in
he
visited
lexington
where
he
met
his
old
friend
darby
and
delivered
lectures
in
public
at
the
sayre
institute
and
the
baptist
school
returning
to
cincinnati
the
following
spring
except
from
his
writings
he
seemed
to
have
no
source
of
revenue
for
several
years
how
he
managed
to
exist
his
most
intimate
friends
could
only
conjecture
true
he
contributed
papers
to
monthly
publications
but
they
appeared
at
such
long
intervals
they
could
not
be
relied
on
for
support
so
in
the
autumn
of
his
friends
organized
for
him
a
course
of
lectures
which
were
well
patronized
by
physicians
and
others
versed
in
science
in
the
meantime
negotiations
were
opened
with
prominent
citizens
of
suburban
towns
for
other
lectures
and
efforts
were
made
to
retire
the
professor
on
an
annuity
his
end
drawing
near
enfeebled
health
which
confined
him
to
his
room
for
several
weeks
prevented
him
from
entering
on
the
suburban
course
so
a
second
course
was
projected
for
the
city
and
one
of
the
lectures
delivered
from
what
transpired
after
that
lecture
his
friends
were
again
anxious
regarding
his
health
and
as
the
time
approached
for
the
delivery
of
the
second
determined
to
see
him
for
reasons
stated
elsewhere
it
was
with
some
difficulty
he
was
found
prostrated
on
a
couch
he
was
suffering
from
a
hemorrhage
of
the
lungs
of
a
few
days
previous
with
evidences
all
around
of
a
state
of
extreme
destitution
no
time
was
lost
in
having
him
removed
to
comfortable
quarters
in
the
good
samaritan
hospital
where
his
friends
arranged
for
his
care
as
a
private
patient
next
day
april
he
expressed
himself
as
greatly
benefited
by
the
change
and
talked
cheerfully
and
hopefully
of
the
future
next
day
friday
he
continued
to
improve
but
on
saturday
proof
of
his
forthcoming
article
in
the
popular
science
monthly
reached
him
and
feeling
that
he
ought
to
return
it
promptly
he
sat
up
to
do
the
work
the
effort
was
too
great
overcome
with
exhaustion
after
its
completion
he
sank
to
sleep
and
a
little
after
two
next
morning
april
his
weary
spirit
peacefully
took
its
flight
born
in
the
professor
was
then
in
the
year
of
his
age
his
obsequies
a
committee
of
the
more
intimate
friends
of
the
deceased
was
formed
consisting
of
the
late
jacob
traber
his
nephew
sproull
drs
and
william
taft
and
the
writer
funeral
services
were
held
in
the
chapel
of
the
hospital
where
considering
the
suddenness
of
the
professor
demise
many
mourners
were
present
the
interest
evinced
was
profound
while
the
floral
tributes
that
covered
the
casket
were
eloquent
of
affection
and
esteem
the
remains
were
interred
in
a
burial
lot
of
jacob
traber
who
generously
tendered
its
use
until
a
separate
place
of
interment
and
a
monument
could
be
procured
the
remains
of
the
two
friends
now
lie
side
by
side
his
effects
after
the
funeral
the
committee
referred
to
visited
the
room
occupied
by
the
professor
prior
to
his
decease
and
had
the
writer
as
his
nearest
friend
procure
letters
of
administration
so
that
papers
of
value
if
any
would
be
cared
for
a
few
letters
some
private
relics
unsalable
remnants
of
books
and
pamphlets
and
scraps
of
manuscript
constituted
the
effects
the
scarcity
of
manuscript
was
easily
accounted
for
as
it
was
the
habit
of
the
deceased
for
years
to
print
articles
designed
for
publication
and
have
them
mailed
to
magazines
and
to
savants
in
different
parts
of
europe
and
america
characteristics
and
habits
of
study
a
prominent
characteristic
of
vaughn
was
shyness
a
shrinking
from
familiarity
or
conspicuousness
he
never
was
the
first
to
salute
a
casual
acquaintance
on
the
street
and
when
introduced
to
a
stranger
would
extend
his
hand
with
apparent
diffidence
or
reserve
not
with
the
warmth
of
a
hearty
shake
but
rather
with
a
cautious
presentation
of
the
finger
tips
undemonstrative
in
manner
and
inexperienced
in
the
customs
of
social
life
his
diffidence
was
taken
for
coldness
yet
he
was
kind
and
tender
hearted
almost
to
a
fault
and
a
most
grateful
recipient
of
a
favor
in
his
poverty
he
would
part
with
money
or
personal
property
to
people
whom
he
considered
more
necessitous
than
himself
of
the
proceeds
of
his
last
course
of
lectures
he
gave
to
one
such
a
sum
so
large
as
to
almost
discourage
his
friends
from
helping
him
then
too
he
was
glad
to
render
service
to
professional
and
public
men
he
made
translations
for
writers
and
wrote
lectures
for
others
and
made
chemical
analyses
for
the
city
when
payment
was
not
expected
as
to
his
placing
a
commercial
value
upon
his
services
he
never
learned
to
do
it
though
they
often
cost
him
both
time
and
money
that
he
could
not
well
spare
his
waking
hours
were
always
fully
occupied
in
writing
or
study
either
in
his
laboratory
the
libraries
or
in
observations
he
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
geology
of
the
neighborhood
and
the
physical
geography
of
the
entire
continent
as
may
be
seen
by
his
articles
on
volcanoes
the
origin
of
lakes
and
mountains
the
absence
of
trees
on
prairies
malaria
etc
his
ingenuity
in
the
construction
of
apparatus
for
his
illustrations
in
chemistry
was
remarkable
given
a
few
tubes
of
glass
and
rubber
a
piece
of
tin
some
acid
and
alkali
a
soldering
iron
and
a
pair
of
pinchers
he
could
construct
at
will
enough
apparatus
for
a
lesson
a
lecture
or
an
analysis
considering
his
poverty
it
may
be
questioned
how
he
was
able
to
maintain
a
laboratory
for
twelve
years
he
found
a
room
at
the
medical
college
at
other
times
he
extemporized
quarters
at
his
humble
lodgings
where
the
same
apartment
was
to
him
laboratory
study
and
living
room
such
a
room
he
could
not
find
in
a
private
house
so
he
sought
it
elsewhere
as
in
the
tenement
in
which
he
was
found
in
his
last
illness
that
life
necessarily
isolated
him
from
society
its
pleasures
and
advantages
before
he
became
familiar
with
the
laws
by
which
it
was
governed
having
acquired
a
mastery
of
greek
and
latin
in
his
youth
he
had
a
good
preparation
for
the
acquisition
of
the
modern
languages
besides
to
prosecute
his
studies
and
investigations
he
found
it
necessary
to
understand
most
of
the
languages
of
europe
exception
has
been
taken
to
the
professor
manner
as
a
lecturer
when
we
consider
his
natural
diffidence
in
the
presence
of
strangers
we
are
surprised
that
he
attempted
to
lecture
at
all
take
his
case
when
he
last
lectured
his
lecture
hall
the
operating
room
of
the
dental
college
and
his
platform
that
of
the
operator
with
his
audience
around
but
elevated
a
few
feet
above
him
the
position
was
an
exceedingly
trying
one
and
some
time
elapsed
before
he
was
able
to
make
a
good
start
while
hesitating
on
such
occasions
his
eyes
would
wander
around
the
audience
till
they
rested
on
those
of
a
familiar
friend
immediately
he
addressed
himself
to
that
person
and
confidence
was
restored
like
other
public
speakers
we
know
of
he
continued
to
address
himself
chiefly
to
the
one
selected
however
embarrassing
it
might
be
to
that
individual
his
religious
life
the
professor
was
a
bible
student
if
we
judge
from
fragments
found
among
his
effects
and
a
bible
now
a
relic
in
possession
of
a
former
student
the
book
is
a
curiosity
worn
as
is
the
cover
with
marks
of
his
fingers
as
he
held
it
often
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
as
shown
by
occasional
drippings
on
the
page
and
cover
he
was
not
a
member
of
any
church
at
least
had
not
been
up
to
a
month
before
his
decease
though
he
visited
churches
of
all
denominations
and
was
familiar
with
their
doctrines
and
polity
his
religion
consisted
in
his
living
up
to
his
highest
ideas
of
right
and
truth
hence
he
was
charitable
almost
to
a
fault
when
he
had
not
money
to
give
he
parted
with
his
books
an
eloquent
public
speaker
referring
to
his
private
life
has
said
he
was
social
kind
and
humane
he
took
pleasure
in
instructing
the
children
and
communing
with
friends
good
men
and
women
who
loved
and
admired
him
and
his
humanity
was
gratified
in
bestowing
what
he
valued
most
knowledge
to
him
nothing
seemed
more
precious
than
truth
and
to
shed
the
light
of
it
abroad
his
heart
was
in
his
work
and
without
a
glance
to
the
right
or
left
he
pursued
his
arduous
quest
of
the
works
of
creation
which
occupied
so
much
of
his
thoughts
the
professor
views
may
be
had
by
reading
the
following
concluding
remarks
found
in
his
physical
astronomy
whatever
doubts
may
hang
over
all
speculations
respecting
distant
events
either
of
past
or
future
time
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
our
universe
will
ever
exhibit
great
and
useful
operations
throughout
its
extensive
domains
from
the
ruins
of
some
celestial
bodies
others
will
rise
to
act
a
part
in
the
drama
of
the
physical
creation
in
future
ages
though
nature
work
may
all
decay
her
laws
remain
the
same
and
numerous
agencies
obedient
to
their
control
and
aided
by
occasional
interventions
of
creative
power
must
maintain
the
heavens
forever
in
a
harmonious
condition
and
transform
innumerable
spheres
into
seats
of
light
and
intelligence
while
the
laws
of
nature
have
been
thus
widely
ordained
for
such
great
ends
their
simplicity
renders
them
intelligible
to
the
limited
powers
of
the
human
mind
and
the
immense
universe
thus
becomes
a
vast
field
of
intellectual
enjoyment
for
man
testimony
of
the
late
john
hancock
the
late
hancock
in
writing
to
mclaughlin
stated
that
he
attended
institute
lectures
of
vaughn
making
his
acquaintance
at
a
meeting
of
the
southwestern
ohio
normal
institute
the
professor
was
engaged
to
lecture
on
his
favorite
specialties
physical
geography
and
astronomy
it
is
my
recollection
says
the
doctor
that
vaughn
was
a
graduate
of
trinity
collage
dublin
however
that
may
be
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
his
wide
and
profound
scholarship
he
was
not
only
deeply
versed
in
the
physical
sciences
but
was
equally
proficient
in
the
classics
and
mathematics
it
is
said
by
competent
judges
that
he
read
greek
and
latin
as
he
would
english
as
though
he
thought
in
those
languages
and
he
was
one
of
the
few
americans
who
read
through
laplace
celeste
he
had
a
prodigious
memory
at
the
oxford
institute
to
which
i
have
referred
some
dozen
of
the
leading
members
vaughn
among
them
got
up
some
literary
games
requiring
wide
reading
and
retentive
memories
for
successful
rivalry
in
these
games
the
professor
showed
a
wealth
of
reading
and
an
ability
to
use
it
on
the
instant
that
i
have
never
seen
approached
by
any
other
scholar
it
is
needless
to
say
that
he
was
first
in
the
game
and
the
rest
nowhere
some
ten
years
afterward
when
connected
with
nelson
commercial
college
i
edited
a
little
educational
paper
the
news
and
educator
of
which
nelson
was
proprietor
in
this
relation
i
came
much
more
frequently
in
contact
with
vaughn
than
i
ever
did
before
to
this
paper
he
contributed
a
number
of
articles
on
scientific
subjects
but
being
printed
in
an
obscure
local
paper
they
attracted
little
attention
reminiscences
of
stamps
eliza
stamps
widow
of
the
late
colonel
stamps
in
giving
her
experience
with
the
professor
said
he
was
a
very
industrious
student
in
his
profound
researches
pursuing
them
to
the
exclusion
of
every
thing
else
he
would
frequently
forget
the
demands
of
hunger
and
disregard
the
summons
to
his
meals
as
to
his
engaging
in
innocent

the
late
jacob
traber
one
of
the
most
intimate
friends
of

has
written
in
the
year
i
was
in
the
office
of
john
sayre
bookseller
high
holborn
where
i
made
the
purchase
of
books
that
were
yet
in
the
hands
of
the
printer
i
gave
my
address
and
directions
for
shipping
when
in
the
act
of
leaving
the
office
i
was
accosted
by
an
elderly
gentleman
who
with
the
apology
pardon
i
overheard
you
when
you
gave
your
address
cincinnati
and
desire
to
make
inquiry
about
one
of
your
distinguished
citizens
daniel
vaughn
assuming
that
you
know
him
may
i
ask
how
long
it
is
since
you
have
seen
him
i
replied
that
i
had
known
the
professor
some
four
years
and
had
met
him
but
a
few
months
ago
at
that
time
i
regarded
the
professor
as
a
mechanical
genius
of
the
speculative
type
and
so
expressed
myself
a
quick
rejoinder
came
in
that
broad
and
forcible
accent
of
an
englishman
you
cincinnati
people
vote
vaughn
as
a
speculative
mechanic
the
ripest
and
profoundest
mathematical
scholar
in
england
may
be
marked
as
his
apprentice
you
have
a
treasure
in
that
man
why
sir
we
send
him
problems
that
fail
to
be
mastered
here
and
speedily
have
them
back
not
only
with
a
solution
but
with
the
demonstration
the
speaker
proved
to
be
one
of
the
ablest
scholars
and
scientists
in
europe
fixing
the
responsibility
for
his
condition
the
subject
of
this
paper
it
will
be
inferred
did
not
inherit
a
patrimony
yet
he
contributed
his
valuable
services
to
many
worthy
objects
without
pecuniary
compensation
as
has
been
stated
his
great
pleasure
next
to
the
investigation
of
truth
was
to
impart
useful
knowledge
and
help
the
needy
when
in
the
medical
college
he
was
paid
with
shares
of
stock
on
which
a
dividend
was
never
declared
and
when
engaged
in
lecturing
and
teaching
his
diffidence
prevented
him
from
placing
a
sufficient
value
on
his
services
living
the
life
of
a
recluse
he
concealed
his
poverty
from
his
nearest
friends
who
were
ignorant
even
of
his
address
then
he
never
sought
a
gratuity
and
his
friends
could
only
learn
by
conjecture
when
he
was
in
need
when
asked
if
his
privations
did
not
cause
him
much
anxiety
he
said
they
gave
him
no
concern
on
more
than
one
occasion
the
writer
at
the
request
of
men
of
wealth
and
influence
proposed
to
retire
him
on
an
annuity
but
he
modestly
but
firmly
declined
to
accept
and
it
was
not
until
after
the
announcement
of
his
last
course
that
he
consented
then
the
proposition
was
to
pay
his
expenses
at
a
hotel
of
his
choice
and
advance
him
money
for
his
personal
expenses
for
which
he
was
to
lecture
when
and
where
he
might
choose
the
gentlemen
most
active
in
this
project
were
the
following
now
deceased
henry
peachy
william
corry
jacob
traber
colonel
geoffrey
and
others
favorably
known
to
the
public
were

and
william

thad
reamy

the
project
had
so
far
matured
that
the
writer
and
another
had
arranged
with
peachy
to
make
the
lafayette

of

survived
he
would
have
enjoyed
a
life
of
leisure
and
comfort
at
one
of

most
prominent
hotels
in

the
people
of
cincinnati
were
therefore
not
responsible
for
the
poverty
of

for

in

of

would
have
been
painfully
embarrassing

seemingly
embraces
