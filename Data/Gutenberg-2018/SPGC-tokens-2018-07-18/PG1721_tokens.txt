the
tale
of
the
peacock
trees
squire
vane
was
an
elderly
schoolboy
of
english
education
and
irish
extraction
his
english
education
at
one
of
the
great
public
schools
had
preserved
his
intellect
perfectly
and
permanently
at
the
stage
of
boyhood
but
his
irish
extraction
subconsciously
upset
in
him
the
proper
solemnity
of
an
old
boy
and
sometimes
gave
him
back
the
brighter
outlook
of
a
naughty
boy
he
had
a
bodily
impatience
which
played
tricks
upon
him
almost
against
his
will
and
had
already
rendered
him
rather
too
radiant
a
failure
in
civil
and
diplomatic
service
thus
it
is
true
that
compromise
is
the
key
of
british
policy
especially
as
effecting
an
impartiality
among
the
religions
of
india
but
vane
s
attempt
to
meet
the
moslem
halfway
by
kicking
off
one
boot
at
the
gates
of
the
mosque
was
felt
not
so
much
to
indicate
true
impartiality
as
something
that
could
only
be
called
an
aggressive
indifference
again
it
is
true
that
an
english
aristocrat
can
hardly
enter
fully
into
the
feelings
of
either
party
in
a
quarrel
between
a
russian
jew
and
an
orthodox
procession
carrying
relics
but
vane
s
idea
that
the
procession
might
carry
the
jew
as
well
himself
a
venerable
and
historic
relic
was
misunderstood
on
both
sides
in
short
he
was
a
man
who
particularly
prided
himself
on
having
no
nonsense
about
him
with
the
result
that
he
was
always
doing
nonsensical
things
he
seemed
to
be
standing
on
his
head
merely
to
prove
that
he
was
he
had
just
finished
a
hearty
breakfast
in
the
society
of
his
daughter
at
a
table
under
a
tree
in
his
garden
by
the
cornish
coast
for
having
a
glorious
circulation
he
insisted
on
as
many
outdoor
meals
as
possible
though
spring
had
barely
touched
the
woods
and
warmed
the
seas
round
that
southern
extremity
of
england
his
daughter
barbara
a
girl
with
heavy
red
hair
and
a
face
as
grave
as
one
of
the
garden
statues
still
sat
almost
motionless
as
a
statue
when
her
father
rose
a
fine
tall
figure
in
light
clothes
with
his
white
hair
and
mustache
flying
backwards
rather
fiercely
from
a
face
that
was
enough
for
he
carried
his
very
wide
panama
hat
in
his
hand
he
strode
across
the
terraced
garden
down
some
stone
steps
flanked
with
old
ornamental
urns
to
a
more
woodland
path
fringed
with
little
trees
and
so
down
a
zigzag
road
which
descended
the
craggy
cliff
to
the
shore
where
he
was
to
meet
a
guest
arriving
by
boat
a
yacht
was
already
in
the
blue
bay
and
he
could
see
a
boat
pulling
toward
the
little
paved
pier
and
yet
in
that
short
walk
between
the
green
turf
and
the
yellow
sands
he
was
destined
to
find
his
provoked
into
a
not
unfamiliar
phase
which
the
world
was
inclined
to
call
the
fact
was
that
the
cornish
peasantry
who
composed
his
tenantry
and
domestic
establishment
were
far
from
being
people
with
no
nonsense
about
them
there
was
alas
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
about
them
with
ghosts
witches
and
traditions
as
old
as
merlin
they
seemed
to
surround
him
with
a
fairy
ring
of
nonsense
but
the
magic
circle
had
one
center
there
was
one
point
in
which
the
curving
conversation
of
the
rustics
always
returned
it
was
a
point
that
always
pricked
the
squire
to
exasperation
and
even
in
this
short
walk
he
seemed
to
strike
it
everywhere
he
paused
before
descending
the
steps
from
the
lawn
to
speak
to
the
gardener
about
potting
some
foreign
shrubs
and
the
gardener
seemed
to
be
gloomily
gratified
in
every
line
of
his
leathery
brown
visage
at
the
chance
of
indicating
that
he
had
formed
a
low
opinion
of
foreign
shrubs
we
wish
you
d
get
rid
of
what
you
ve
got
here
sir
he
observed
digging
doggedly
nothing
ll
grow
right
with
them
shrubs
said
the
squire
laughing
you
don
t
call
the
peacock
trees
shrubs
do
you
fine
tall
trees
you
ought
to
be
proud
of
ill
weeds
grow
apace
observed
the
gardener
weeds
can
grow
as
houses
when
somebody
plants
then
he
added
him
that
sowed
tares
in
the
bible
oh
blast
your
began
the
squire
and
then
replaced
the
more
apt
and
alliterative
word
bible
by
the
general
word
he
was
himself
a
robust
rationalist
but
he
went
to
church
to
set
his
tenants
an
example
of
what
it
would
have
puzzled
him
to
say
a
little
way
along
the
lower
path
by
the
trees
he
encountered
a
woodcutter
one
martin
who
was
more
explicit
having
more
of
a
grievance
his
daughter
was
at
that
time
seriously
ill
with
a
fever
recently
common
on
that
coast
and
the
squire
who
was
a
gentleman
would
normally
have
made
allowances
for
low
spirits
and
loss
of
temper
but
he
came
near
to
losing
his
own
again
when
the
peasant
persisted
in
connecting
his
tragedy
with
the
traditional
monomania
about
the
foreign
trees
if
she
were
well
enough
i
d
move
her
said
the
woodcutter
as
we
can
t
move
them
i
suppose
i
d
just
like
to
get
my
chopper
into
them
and
feel
em
come
crashing
one
would
think
they
were
dragons
said
vane
and
that
s
about
what
they
look
like
replied
martin
look
at
em
the
woodman
was
naturally
a
rougher
and
even
wilder
figure
than
the
gardener
his
face
also
was
brown
and
looked
like
an
antique
parchment
and
it
was
framed
in
an
outlandish
arrangement
of
raven
beard
and
whiskers
which
was
really
a
fashion
fifty
years
ago
but
might
have
been
five
thousand
years
old
or
older
phoenicians
one
felt
trading
on
those
strange
shores
in
the
morning
of
the
world
might
have
combed
or
curled
or
braided
their
hair
into
some
such
quaint
patterns
for
this
patch
of
population
was
as
much
a
corner
of
cornwall
as
cornwall
is
a
corner
of
england
a
tragic
and
unique
race
small
and
interrelated
like
a
celtic
clan
the
clan
was
older
than
the
vane
family
though
that
was
old
as
county
families
go
for
in
many
such
parts
of
england
it
is
the
aristocrats
who
are
the
latest
arrivals
it
was
the
sort
of
racial
type
that
is
supposed
to
be
passing
and
perhaps
has
already
passed
the
obnoxious
objects
stood
some
hundred
yards
away
from
the
speaker
who
waved
toward
them
with
his
ax
and
there
was
something
suggestive
in
the
comparison
that
coast
to
begin
with
stretching
toward
the
sunset
was
itself
almost
as
fantastic
as
a
sunset
cloud
it
was
cut
out
against
the
emerald
or
indigo
of
the
sea
in
graven
horns
and
crescents
that
might
be
the
cast
or
mold
of
some
such
crested
serpents
and
beneath
was
pierced
and
fretted
by
caves
and
crevices
as
if
by
the
boring
of
some
such
titanic
worms
over
and
above
this
draconian
architecture
of
the
earth
a
veil
of
gray
woods
hung
thinner
like
a
vapor
woods
which
the
witchcraft
of
the
sea
had
as
usual
both
blighted
and
blown
out
of
shape
to
the
right
the
trees
trailed
along
the
sea
front
in
a
single
line
each
drawn
out
in
thin
wild
lines
like
a
caricature
at
the
other
end
of
their
extent
they
multiplied
into
a
huddle
of
hunchbacked
trees
a
wood
spreading
toward
a
projecting
part
of
the
high
coast
it
was
here
that
the
sight
appeared
to
which
so
many
eyes
and
minds
seemed
to
be
almost
automatically
turning
out
of
the
middle
of
this
low
and
more
or
less
level
wood
rose
three
separate
stems
that
shot
up
and
soared
into
the
sky
like
a
lighthouse
out
of
the
waves
or
a
church
spire
out
of
the
village
roofs
they
formed
a
clump
of
three
columns
close
together
which
might
well
be
the
mere
bifurcation
or
rather
trifurcation
of
one
tree
the
lower
part
being
lost
or
sunken
in
the
thick
wood
around
everything
about
them
suggested
something
stranger
and
more
southern
than
anything
even
in
that
last
peninsula
of
britain
which
pushes
out
farthest
toward
spain
and
africa
and
the
southern
stars
their
leathery
leafage
had
sprouted
in
advance
of
the
faint
mist
of
around
them
and
it
was
of
another
and
less
natural
green
tinged
with
blue
like
the
colors
of
a
kingfisher
but
one
might
fancy
it
the
scales
of
some
dragon
towering
over
a
herd
of
huddled
and
fleeing
cattle
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
your
girl
is
so
unwell
said
vane
shortly
but
really
and
he
strode
down
the
steep
road
with
plunging
strides
the
boat
was
already
secured
to
the
little
stone
jetty
and
the
boatman
a
younger
shadow
of
the
woodcutter
and
indeed
a
nephew
of
that
useful
malcontent
saluted
his
territorial
lord
with
the
sullen
formality
of
the
family
the
squire
acknowledged
it
casually
and
had
soon
forgotten
all
such
things
in
shaking
hands
with
the
visitor
who
had
just
come
ashore
the
visitor
was
a
long
loose
man
very
lean
to
be
so
young
whose
long
fine
features
seemed
wholly
fitted
together
of
bone
and
nerve
and
seemed
somehow
to
contrast
with
his
hair
that
showed
in
vivid
yellow
patches
upon
his
hollow
temples
under
the
brim
of
his
white
holiday
hat
he
was
carefully
dressed
in
exquisite
taste
though
he
had
come
straight
from
a
considerable
sea
voyage
and
he
carried
something
in
his
hand
which
in
his
long
european
travels
and
even
longer
european
visits
he
had
almost
forgotten
to
call
a
gripsack
cyprian
paynter
was
an
american
who
lived
in
italy
there
was
a
good
deal
more
to
be
said
about
him
for
he
was
a
very
acute
and
cultivated
gentleman
but
those
two
facts
would
perhaps
cover
most
of
the
others
storing
his
mind
like
a
museum
with
the
wonder
of
the
old
world
but
all
lit
up
as
by
a
window
with
the
wonder
of
the
new
he
had
fallen
heir
to
some
thing
of
the
unique
critical
position
of
ruskin
or
pater
and
was
further
famous
as
a
discoverer
of
minor
poets
he
was
a
judicious
discoverer
and
he
did
not
turn
all
his
minor
poets
into
major
prophets
if
his
geese
were
swans
they
were
not
all
swans
of
avon
he
had
even
incurred
the
deadly
suspicion
of
classicism
by
differing
from
his
young
friends
the
punctuist
poets
when
they
produced
versification
consisting
exclusively
of
commas
and
colons
he
had
a
more
humane
sympathy
with
the
modern
flame
kindled
from
the
embers
of
celtic
mythology
and
it
was
in
reality
the
recent
appearance
of
a
cornish
poet
a
sort
of
parallel
to
the
new
irish
poets
which
had
brought
him
on
this
occasion
to
cornwall
he
was
indeed
far
too
to
allow
a
host
to
guess
that
any
pleasure
was
being
sought
outside
his
own
hospitality
he
had
a
long
standing
invitation
from
vane
whom
he
had
met
in
cyprus
in
the
latter
s
days
of
undiplomatic
diplomacy
and
vane
was
not
aware
that
relations
had
only
been
thus
renewed
after
the
critic
had
read
merlin
and
other
verses
by
a
new
writer
named
john
treherne
nor
did
the
squire
even
begin
to
realize
the
much
more
diplomatic
diplomacy
by
which
he
had
been
induced
to
invite
the
local
bard
to
lunch
on
the
very
day
of
the
american
critic
s
arrival
paynter
was
still
standing
with
his
gripsack
gazing
in
a
trance
of
true
admiration
at
the
hollowed
crags
topped
by
the
gray
grotesque
wood
and
crested
finally
by
the
three
fantastic
trees
it
is
like
being
shipwrecked
on
the
coast
of
fairyland
he
said
i
hope
you
haven
t
been
shipwrecked
much
replied
his
host
smiling
i
fancy
jake
here
can
look
after
you
very
paynter
looked
across
at
the
boatman
and
smiled
also
i
am
afraid
he
said
our
friend
is
not
quite
so
enthusiastic
for
this
landscape
as
i
oh
the
trees
i
suppose
said
the
squire
wearily
the
boatman
was
by
normal
trade
a
fisherman
but
as
his
house
built
of
black
tarred
timber
stood
right
on
the
foreshore
a
few
yards
from
the
pier
he
was
employed
in
such
cases
as
a
sort
of
ferryman
he
was
a
big
youth
generally
silent
but
something
seemed
now
to
sting
him
into
speech
well
sir
he
said
everybody
knows
it
s
not
natural
everybody
knows
the
sea
blights
trees
and
beats
them
under
when
they
re
only
just
trees
these
things
thrive
like
some
unholy
great
seaweed
that
don
t
belong
to
the
land
at
all
it
s
like
the
the
blessed
sea
serpent
got
on
shore
squire
and
eating
everything
there
is
some
stupid
legend
said
squire
vane
gruffly
but
come
up
into
the
garden
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
my
when
however
they
reached
the
little
table
under
the
tree
the
apparently
immovable
young
lady
had
moved
away
after
all
and
it
was
some
time
before
they
came
upon
the
track
of
her
she
had
risen
though
languidly
and
wandered
slowly
along
the
upper
path
of
the
terraced
garden
looking
down
on
the
lower
path
where
it
ran
closer
to
the
main
bulk
of
the
little
wood
by
the
sea
her
languor
was
not
a
feebleness
but
rather
a
fullness
of
life
like
that
of
a
child
half
awake
she
seemed
to
stretch
herself
and
enjoy
everything
without
noticing
anything
she
passed
the
wood
into
the
gray
huddle
of
which
a
single
white
path
vanished
through
a
black
hole
along
this
part
of
the
terrace
ran
something
like
a
low
rampart
or
balustrade
embowered
with
flowers
at
intervals
and
she
leaned
over
it
looking
down
at
another
glimpse
of
the
glowing
sea
behind
the
clump
of
trees
and
on
another
irregular
path
tumbling
down
to
the
pier
and
the
boatman
s
cottage
on
the
beach
as
she
gazed
sleepily
enough
she
saw
that
a
strange
figure
was
very
actively
climbing
the
path
apparently
coming
from
the
fisherman
s
cottage
so
actively
that
a
moment
afterwards
it
came
out
between
the
trees
and
stood
upon
the
path
just
below
her
it
was
not
only
a
figure
strange
to
her
but
one
somewhat
strange
in
itself
it
was
that
of
a
man
still
young
and
seeming
somehow
younger
than
his
own
clothes
which
were
not
only
shabby
but
antiquated
clothes
common
enough
in
texture
yet
carried
in
an
uncommon
fashion
he
wore
what
was
presumably
a
light
waterproof
perhaps
through
having
come
off
the
sea
but
it
was
held
at
the
throat
by
one
button
and
hung
sleeves
and
all
more
like
a
cloak
than
a
coat
he
rested
one
bony
hand
on
a
black
stick
under
the
shadow
of
his
broad
hat
his
black
hair
hung
down
in
a
tuft
or
two
his
face
which
was
swarthy
but
rather
handsome
in
itself
wore
something
that
may
have
been
a
slightly
embarrassed
smile
but
had
too
much
the
appearance
of
a
sneer
whether
this
apparition
was
a
tramp
or
a
trespasser
or
a
friend
of
some
of
the
fishers
or
woodcutters
barbara
vane
was
quite
unable
to
guess
he
removed
his
hat
still
with
his
unaltered
and
rather
sinister
smile
and
said
civilly
excuse
me
the
squire
asked
me
to
here
he
caught
sight
of
martin
the
woodman
who
was
shifting
along
the
path
thinning
the
thin
trees
and
the
stranger
made
a
familiar
salute
with
one
finger
the
girl
did
not
know
what
to
say
have
you
have
you
come
about
cutting
the
wood
she
asked
at
last
i
would
i
were
so
honest
a
man
replied
the
stranger
martin
is
i
fancy
a
distant
cousin
of
mine
we
cornish
folk
just
round
here
are
nearly
all
related
you
know
but
i
do
not
cut
wood
i
do
not
cut
anything
except
perhaps
capers
i
am
so
to
speak
a
a
what
asked
barbara
a
minstrel
shall
we
say
answered
the
newcomer
and
looked
up
at
her
more
steadily
during
a
rather
odd
silence
their
eyes
rested
on
each
other
what
she
saw
has
been
already
noted
though
by
her
at
any
rate
not
in
the
least
understood
what
he
saw
was
a
decidedly
beautiful
woman
with
a
statuesque
face
and
hair
that
shone
in
the
sun
like
a
helmet
of
copper
do
you
know
he
went
on
that
in
this
old
place
hundreds
of
years
ago
a
jongleur
may
really
have
stood
where
i
stand
and
a
lady
may
really
have
looked
over
that
wall
and
thrown
him
money
do
you
want
money
she
asked
all
at
sea
well
drawled
the
stranger
in
the
sense
of
lacking
it
perhaps
but
i
fear
there
is
no
place
now
for
a
minstrel
except
nigger
minstrel
i
must
apologize
for
not
blacking
my
she
laughed
a
little
in
her
bewilderment
and
said
well
i
hardly
think
you
need
do
you
think
the
natives
here
are
dark
enough
already
perhaps
he
observed
calmly
after
all
we
are
aborigines
and
are
treated
as
she
threw
out
some
desperate
remark
about
the
weather
or
the
scenery
and
wondered
what
would
happen
next
the
prospect
is
certainly
beautiful
he
assented
in
the
same
enigmatic
manner
there
is
only
one
thing
in
it
i
am
doubtful
while
she
stood
in
silence
he
slowly
lifted
his
black
stick
like
a
long
black
finger
and
pointed
it
at
the
peacock
trees
above
the
wood
and
a
queer
feeling
of
disquiet
fell
on
the
girl
as
if
he
were
by
that
mere
gesture
doing
a
destructive
act
and
could
send
a
blight
upon
the
garden
the
strained
and
almost
painful
silence
was
broken
by
the
voice
of
squire
vane
loud
even
while
it
was
still
distant
we
couldn
t
make
out
where
you
d
got
to
barbara
he
said
this
is
my
friend
cyprian
the
next
moment
he
saw
the
stranger
and
stopped
a
little
puzzled
it
was
only
cyprian
paynter
himself
who
was
equal
to
the
situation
he
had
seen
months
ago
a
portrait
of
the
new
cornish
poet
in
some
american
literary
magazine
and
he
found
himself
to
his
surprise
the
introducer
instead
of
the
introduced
why
squire
he
said
in
considerable
astonishment
don
t
you
know
treherne
i
supposed
of
course
he
was
a
delighted
to
see
you
treherne
said
the
squire
recovering
his
manners
with
a
certain
genial
confusion
so
pleased
you
were
able
to
come
this
is
paynter
daughter
and
turning
with
a
certain
boisterous
embarrassment
he
led
the
way
to
the
table
under
the
tree
cyprian
paynter
followed
inwardly
revolving
a
puzzle
which
had
taken
even
his
experience
by
surprise
the
american
if
intellectually
an
aristocrat
was
still
socially
and
subconsciously
a
democrat
it
had
never
crossed
his
mind
that
the
poet
should
be
counted
lucky
to
know
the
squire
and
not
the
squire
to
know
the
poet
the
honest
patronage
in
vane
s
hospitality
was
something
which
made
paynter
feel
he
was
after
all
an
exile
in
england
the
squire
anticipating
the
trial
of
luncheon
with
a
strange
literary
man
had
dealt
with
the
case
tactfully
from
his
own
standpoint
county
society
might
have
made
the
guest
feel
like
a
fish
out
of
water
and
except
for
the
american
critic
and
the
local
lawyer
and
doctor
worthy
people
who
fitted
into
the
picture
he
had
kept
it
as
a
family
party
he
was
a
widower
and
when
the
meal
had
been
laid
out
on
the
garden
table
it
was
barbara
who
presided
as
hostess
she
had
the
new
poet
on
her
right
hand
and
it
made
her
very
uncomfortable
she
had
practically
offered
that
fallacious
jongleur
money
and
it
did
not
make
it
easier
to
offer
him
lunch
the
whole
countryside
s
gone
mad
announced
the
squire
by
way
of
the
latest
local
news
it
s
about
this
infernal
legend
of
i
collect
legends
said
paynter
smiling
you
must
remember
i
haven
t
yet
had
a
chance
to
collect
yours
and
this
he
added
looking
round
at
the
romantic
coast
is
a
fine
theater
for
anything
oh
it
s
dramatic
in
its
way
admitted
vane
not
without
a
faint
satisfaction
it
s
all
about
those
things
over
there
we
call
the
peacock
trees
i
suppose
because
of
the
queer
color
of
the
leaf
you
know
though
i
have
heard
they
make
a
shrill
noise
in
a
high
wind
that
s
supposed
to
be
like
the
shriek
of
a
peacock
something
like
a
bamboo
in
the
botanical
structure
perhaps
well
those
trees
are
supposed
to
have
been
brought
over
from
barbary
by
my
ancestor
sir
walter
vane
one
of
the
elizabethan
patriots
or
pirates
or
whatever
you
call
them
they
say
that
at
the
end
of
his
last
voyage
the
villagers
gathered
on
the
beach
down
there
and
saw
the
boat
standing
in
from
the
sea
and
the
new
trees
stood
up
in
the
boat
like
a
mast
all
gay
with
leaves
out
of
season
like
green
bunting
and
as
they
watched
they
thought
at
first
that
the
boat
was
steering
oddly
and
then
that
it
wasn
t
steering
at
all
and
when
it
drifted
to
the
shore
at
last
every
man
in
that
boat
was
dead
and
sir
walter
vane
with
his
sword
drawn
was
leaning
up
against
the
tree
trunk
as
stiff
as
the
now
this
is
rather
curious
remarked
paynter
thoughtfully
i
told
you
i
collected
legends
and
i
fancy
i
can
tell
you
the
beginning
of
the
story
of
which
that
is
the
end
though
it
comes
hundreds
of
miles
across
the
he
tapped
meditatively
on
the
table
with
his
thin
taper
fingers
like
a
man
trying
to
recall
a
tune
he
had
indeed
made
a
hobby
of
such
fables
and
he
was
not
without
vanity
about
his
artistic
touch
in
telling
them
oh
do
tell
us
your
part
of
it
cried
barbara
vane
whose
air
of
sunny
sleepiness
seemed
in
some
vague
degree
to
have
fallen
from
her
the
american
bowed
across
the
table
with
a
serious
politeness
and
then
began
playing
idly
with
a
quaint
ring
on
his
long
finger
as
he
talked
if
you
go
down
to
the
barbary
coast
where
the
last
wedge
of
the
forest
narrows
down
between
the
desert
and
the
great
tideless
sea
you
will
find
the
natives
still
telling
a
strange
story
about
a
saint
of
the
dark
ages
there
on
the
twilight
border
of
the
dark
continent
you
feel
the
dark
ages
i
have
only
visited
the
place
once
though
it
lies
so
to
speak
opposite
to
the
italian
city
where
i
lived
for
years
and
yet
you
would
hardly
believe
how
the
and
transmigration
of
this
myth
somehow
seemed
less
mad
than
they
really
are
with
the
wood
loud
with
lions
at
night
and
that
dark
red
solitude
beyond
they
say
that
the
hermit
securis
living
there
among
trees
grew
to
love
them
like
companions
since
though
great
giants
with
many
arms
like
briareus
they
were
the
mildest
and
most
blameless
of
the
creatures
they
did
not
devour
like
the
lions
but
rather
opened
their
arms
to
all
the
little
birds
and
he
prayed
that
they
might
be
loosened
from
time
to
time
to
walk
like
other
things
and
the
trees
were
moved
upon
the
prayers
of
securis
as
they
were
at
the
songs
of
orpheus
the
men
of
the
desert
were
stricken
from
afar
with
fear
seeing
the
saint
walking
with
a
walking
grove
like
a
schoolmaster
with
his
boys
for
the
trees
were
thus
freed
under
strict
conditions
of
discipline
they
were
to
return
at
the
sound
of
the
hermit
s
bell
and
above
all
to
copy
the
wild
beasts
in
walking
only
to
destroy
and
devour
nothing
well
it
is
said
that
one
of
the
trees
heard
a
voice
that
was
not
the
saint
s
that
in
the
warm
green
twilight
of
one
summer
evening
it
became
conscious
of
some
thing
sitting
and
speaking
in
its
branches
in
the
guise
of
a
great
bird
and
it
was
that
which
once
spoke
from
a
tree
in
the
guise
of
a
great
serpent
as
the
voice
grew
louder
among
its
murmuring
leaves
the
tree
was
torn
with
a
great
desire
to
stretch
out
and
snatch
at
the
birds
that
flew
harmlessly
about
their
nests
and
pluck
them
to
pieces
finally
the
tempter
filled
the
with
his
own
birds
of
pride
the
starry
pageant
of
the
peacocks
and
the
spirit
of
the
brute
overcame
the
spirit
of
the
tree
and
it
rent
and
consumed
the
birds
till
not
a
plume
was
left
and
returned
to
the
quiet
tribe
of
trees
but
they
say
that
when
spring
came
all
the
other
trees
put
forth
leaves
but
this
put
forth
feathers
of
a
strange
hue
and
pattern
and
by
that
monstrous
assimilation
the
saint
knew
of
the
sin
and
he
rooted
that
one
tree
to
the
earth
with
a
judgment
so
that
evil
should
fall
on
any
who
removed
it
again
that
squire
is
the
beginning
in
the
deserts
of
the
tale
that
ended
here
almost
in
this
and
the
end
is
about
as
reliable
as
the
beginning
i
should
say
said
vane
yours
is
a
nice
plain
tale
for
a
small
a
quiet
little
bit
of
that
what
a
queer
horrible
story
exclaimed
barbara
it
makes
one
feel
like
a
ex
africa
said
the
lawyer
smiling
it
comes
from
a
cannibal
country
i
think
it
s
the
touch
of
the
that
nightmare
feeling
that
you
don
t
know
whether
the
hero
is
a
plant
or
a
man
or
a
devil
don
t
you
feel
it
sometimes
in
uncle
remus
true
said
paynter
perfectly
and
he
looked
at
the
lawyer
with
a
new
interest
the
lawyer
who
had
been
introduced
as
ashe
was
one
of
those
people
who
are
more
worth
looking
at
than
most
people
realize
when
they
look
if
napoleon
had
been
and
had
bent
all
his
powers
with
a
curious
contentment
upon
the
petty
lawsuits
of
a
province
he
might
have
looked
much
the
same
the
head
with
the
red
hair
was
heavy
and
powerful
the
figure
in
its
dark
quiet
clothes
was
comparatively
insignificant
as
was
napoleon
s
he
seemed
more
at
ease
in
the
squire
s
society
than
the
doctor
who
though
a
gentleman
was
a
shy
one
and
a
mere
shadow
of
his
professional
brother
as
you
truly
say
remarked
paynter
the
story
seems
touched
with
quite
barbarous
elements
probably
negro
originally
though
i
think
there
was
really
a
hagiological
story
about
some
hermit
though
some
of
the
higher
critics
say
securis
never
existed
but
was
only
an
allegory
of
arboriculture
since
his
name
is
the
latin
for
an
oh
if
you
come
to
that
remarked
the
poet
treherne
you
might
as
well
say
squire
vane
doesn
t
exist
and
that
he
s
only
an
allegory
for
a
something
a
shade
too
cool
about
this
sally
drew
the
lawyer
s
red
brows
together
he
looked
across
the
table
and
met
the
poet
s
somewhat
equivocal
smile
do
i
understand
treherne
asked
ashe
that
you
support
the
miraculous
claims
of
securis
in
this
case
do
you
by
any
chance
believe
in
the
walking
trees
i
see
men
as
trees
walking
answered
the
poet
like
the
man
cured
of
blindness
in
the
gospel
by
the
way
do
i
understand
that
you
support
the
miraculous
claims
of
that
thaumaturgist
paynter
intervened
swiftly
and
suavely
now
that
sounds
a
fascinating
piece
of
psychology
you
see
men
as
trees
as
i
can
t
imagine
why
men
should
walk
i
can
t
imagine
why
trees
shouldn
t
answered
treherne
obviously
it
is
the
nature
of
the
organism
interposed
the
medical
guest
burton
brown
it
is
necessary
in
the
very
type
of
vegetable
in
other
words
a
tree
sticks
in
the
mud
from
year
s
end
to
year
s
end
answered
treherne
so
do
you
stop
in
your
consulting
room
from
ten
to
eleven
every
day
and
don
t
you
fancy
a
fairy
looking
in
at
your
window
for
a
flash
after
having
just
jumped
over
the
moon
and
played
mulberry
bush
with
the
pleiades
would
think
you
were
a
vegetable
structure
and
that
sitting
still
was
the
nature
of
the
organism
i
don
t
happen
to
believe
in
fairies
said
the
doctor
rather
stiffly
for
the
argumentum
ad
hominem
was
becoming
too
common
a
sulphurous
subconscious
anger
seemed
to
radiate
from
the
dark
poet
well
i
should
hope
not
doctor
began
the
squire
in
his
loud
and
friendly
style
and
then
stopped
seeing
the
other
s
attention
arrested
the
silent
butler
waiting
on
the
guests
had
appeared
behind
the
doctor
s
chair
and
was
saying
something
in
the
low
level
tones
of
the
servant
he
was
so
smooth
a
specimen
of
the
type
that
others
never
noticed
at
first
that
he
also
repeated
the
dark
portrait
however
varnished
so
common
in
this
particular
family
of
cornish
celts
his
face
was
sallow
and
even
yellow
and
his
hair
indigo
black
he
went
by
the
name
of
miles
some
felt
oppressed
by
the
tribal
type
in
this
tiny
corner
of
england
they
felt
somehow
as
if
all
these
dark
faces
were
the
masks
of
a
secret
society
the
doctor
rose
with
a
half
apology
i
must
ask
pardon
for
disturbing
this
pleasant
party
i
am
called
away
on
duty
please
don
t
let
anybody
move
we
have
to
be
ready
for
these
things
you
know
perhaps
treherne
will
admit
that
my
habits
are
not
so
very
vegetable
after
with
this
parthian
shaft
at
which
there
was
some
laughter
he
strode
away
very
rapidly
across
the
sunny
lawn
to
where
the
road
dipped
down
toward
the
village
he
is
very
good
among
the
poor
said
the
girl
with
an
honorable
seriousness
a
capital
fellow
agreed
the
squire
where
is
miles
you
will
have
a
cigar
treherne
and
he
got
up
from
the
table
the
rest
followed
and
the
group
broke
up
on
the
lawn
remarkable
man
treherne
said
the
american
to
the
lawyer
conversationally
remarkable
is
the
word
assented
ashe
rather
grimly
but
i
don
t
think
i
ll
make
any
remark
about
the
squire
too
impatient
to
wait
for
the
miles
had
betaken
himself
indoors
for
the
cigars
and
barbara
found
herself
once
more
paired
off
with
the
poet
as
she
floated
along
the
terrace
garden
but
this
time
symbolically
enough
upon
the
same
level
of
lawn
treherne
looked
less
eccentric
after
having
shed
his
curious
cloak
and
seemed
a
quieter
and
more
casual
figure
i
didn
t
mean
to
be
rude
to
you
just
now
she
said
abruptly
and
that
s
the
worst
of
it
replied
the
man
of
letters
for
i
m
horribly
afraid
i
did
mean
to
be
rude
to
you
when
i
looked
up
and
saw
you
up
there
something
surged
up
in
me
that
was
in
all
the
revolutions
of
history
oh
there
was
admiration
in
it
too
perhaps
there
was
idolatry
in
all
the
he
seemed
to
have
a
power
of
reaching
rather
intimate
conversation
in
one
silent
and
bound
as
he
had
scaled
the
steep
road
and
it
made
her
feel
him
to
be
dangerous
and
perhaps
unscrupulous
she
changed
the
subject
sharply
not
without
it
movement
toward
gratifying
her
own
curiosity
what
did
you
mean
by
all
that
about
walking
trees
she
asked
don
t
tell
me
you
really
believe
in
a
magic
tree
that
eats
birds
i
should
probably
surprise
you
said
treherne
gravely
more
by
what
i
don
t
believe
than
by
what
i
then
after
a
pause
he
made
a
general
gesture
toward
the
house
and
garden
i
m
afraid
i
don
t
believe
in
all
this
for
instance
in
elizabethan
houses
and
elizabethan
families
and
the
way
estates
have
been
improved
and
the
rest
of
it
look
at
our
friend
the
woodcutter
and
he
pointed
to
the
man
with
the
quaint
black
beard
who
was
still
plying
his
ax
upon
the
timber
below
that
man
s
family
goes
back
for
ages
and
it
was
far
richer
and
freer
in
what
you
call
the
dark
ages
than
it
is
now
wait
till
the
cornish
peasant
writes
a
history
of
but
what
in
the
world
she
demanded
has
this
to
do
with
whether
you
believe
in
a
tree
eating
birds
why
should
i
confess
what
i
believe
in
he
said
a
muffled
drum
of
mutiny
in
his
voice
the
gentry
came
here
and
took
our
land
and
took
our
labor
and
took
our
customs
and
now
after
exploitation
a
viler
thing
education
they
must
take
our
dreams
well
this
dream
was
rather
a
nightmare
wasn
t
it
asked
barbara
smiling
and
the
next
moment
grew
quite
grave
saying
almost
anxiously
but
here
s
doctor
brown
back
again
why
he
looks
quite
the
doctor
a
black
figure
on
the
green
lawn
was
indeed
coming
toward
them
at
a
very
vigorous
walk
his
body
and
gait
very
much
younger
than
his
face
which
seemed
prematurely
lined
as
with
worry
his
brow
was
bald
and
projected
from
the
straight
dark
hair
behind
it
he
was
visibly
paler
than
when
he
left
the
lunch
table
i
am
sorry
to
say
miss
vane
he
said
that
i
am
the
bearer
of
bad
news
to
poor
martin
the
woodman
here
his
daughter
died
half
an
hour
oh
cried
barbara
warmly
i
am
so
sorry
so
am
i
said
the
doctor
and
passed
on
rather
abruptly
he
ran
down
the
stone
steps
between
the
stone
urns
and
they
saw
him
in
talk
with
the
woodcutter
they
could
not
see
the
woodcutter
s
face
he
stood
with
his
back
to
them
but
they
saw
something
that
seemed
more
moving
than
any
change
of
countenance
the
man
s
hand
holding
the
ax
rose
high
above
his
head
and
for
a
flash
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
have
cut
down
the
doctor
but
in
fact
he
was
not
looking
at
the
doctor
his
face
was
set
toward
the
cliff
where
sheer
out
of
the
dwarf
forest
rose
gigantic
and
gilded
by
the
sun
the
trees
of
pride
the
strong
brown
hand
made
a
movement
and
was
empty
the
ax
went
circling
swiftly
through
the
air
its
head
showing
like
a
silver
crescent
against
the
gray
twilight
of
the
trees
it
did
not
reach
its
tall
objective
but
fell
among
the
undergrowth
shaking
up
a
flying
litter
of
birds
but
in
the
poet
s
memory
full
of
primal
things
something
seemed
to
say
that
he
had
seen
the
birds
of
some
pagan
augury
the
ax
of
some
pagan
sacrifice
a
moment
after
the
man
made
a
heavy
movement
forward
as
if
to
recover
his
tool
but
the
doctor
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
never
mind
that
now
they
heard
him
say
sadly
and
kindly
the
squire
will
excuse
you
any
more
work
i
something
made
the
girl
look
at
treherne
he
stood
gazing
his
head
a
little
bent
and
one
of
his
black
had
fallen
forward
over
his
forehead
and
again
she
had
the
sense
of
a
shadow
over
the
grass
she
almost
felt
as
if
the
grass
were
a
host
of
fairies
and
that
the
fairies
were
not
her
friends
ii
the
wager
of
squire
vane
it
was
more
than
a
month
before
the
legend
of
the
peacock
trees
was
again
discussed
in
the
squire
s
circle
it
fell
out
one
evening
when
his
eccentric
taste
for
meals
in
the
garden
that
gathered
the
company
round
the
same
table
now
lit
with
a
lamp
and
laid
out
for
dinner
in
a
glowing
spring
twilight
it
was
even
the
same
company
for
in
the
few
weeks
intervening
they
had
insensibly
grown
more
and
more
into
each
other
s
lives
forming
a
little
group
like
a
club
the
american
aesthete
was
of
course
the
most
active
agent
his
resolution
to
pluck
out
the
heart
of
the
cornish
poet
s
mystery
leading
him
again
and
again
to
influence
his
flighty
host
for
such
reunions
even
ashe
the
lawyer
seemed
to
have
swallowed
his
prejudices
and
the
doctor
though
a
rather
sad
and
silent
was
a
companionable
and
considerate
man
paynter
had
even
read
treherne
s
poetry
aloud
and
he
read
admirably
he
had
also
read
other
things
not
aloud
grubbing
up
everything
in
the
neighborhood
from
guidebooks
to
epitaphs
that
could
throw
a
light
on
local
antiquities
and
it
was
that
evening
when
the
lamplight
and
the
last
daylight
had
kindled
the
colors
of
the
wine
and
silver
on
the
table
under
the
tree
that
he
announced
a
new
discovery
say
squire
he
remarked
with
one
of
his
rare
americanisms
about
those
bogey
trees
of
yours
i
don
t
believe
you
know
half
the
tales
told
round
here
about
them
it
seems
they
have
a
way
of
eating
things
not
that
i
have
any
ethical
objection
to
eating
things
he
continued
helping
himself
elegantly
to
green
cheese
but
i
have
more
or
less
broadly
speaking
an
objection
to
eating
eating
people
repeated
barbara
vane
i
know
a
mustn
t
be
fastidious
replied
paynter
but
i
repeat
firmly
an
objection
to
eating
people
the
peacock
trees
seem
to
have
progressed
since
the
happy
days
of
innocence
when
they
only
ate
peacocks
if
you
ask
the
people
here
the
fisherman
who
lives
on
that
beach
or
the
man
that
mows
this
very
lawn
in
front
of
us
they
ll
tell
you
tales
taller
than
any
tropical
one
i
brought
you
from
the
barbary
coast
if
you
ask
them
what
happened
to
the
fisherman
peters
who
got
drunk
on
all
hallows
eve
they
ll
tell
you
he
lost
his
way
in
that
little
wood
tumbled
down
asleep
under
the
wicked
trees
and
then
evaporated
vanished
was
licked
up
like
dew
by
the
sun
if
you
ask
them
where
harry
hawke
is
the
widow
s
little
son
they
ll
just
tell
you
he
s
swallowed
that
he
was
dared
to
climb
the
trees
and
sit
there
all
night
and
did
it
what
the
trees
did
god
knows
the
habits
of
a
vegetable
ogre
leave
one
a
little
vague
but
they
even
add
the
agreeable
detail
that
a
new
branch
appears
on
the
tree
when
somebody
has
petered
out
in
this
what
new
nonsense
is
this
cried
vane
i
know
there
s
some
crazy
yarn
about
the
trees
spreading
fever
though
every
educated
man
knows
why
these
epidemics
return
occasionally
and
i
know
they
say
you
can
tell
the
noise
of
them
among
other
trees
in
a
gale
and
i
dare
say
you
can
but
even
cornwall
isn
t
a
lunatic
asylum
and
a
tree
that
dines
on
a
passing
tourist
well
the
two
tales
are
reconcilable
enough
put
in
the
poet
quietly
if
there
were
a
magic
that
killed
men
when
they
came
close
it
s
likely
to
strike
them
with
sickness
when
they
stand
far
off
in
the
old
romance
the
dragon
that
devours
people
often
blasts
others
with
a
sort
of
poisonous
ashe
looked
across
at
the
speaker
steadily
not
to
say
stonily
do
i
understand
he
inquired
that
you
swallow
the
swallowing
trees
too
treherne
s
dark
smile
was
still
on
the
defensive
his
fencing
always
annoyed
the
other
and
he
seemed
not
without
malice
in
the
matter
swallowing
is
a
metaphor
he
said
about
me
if
not
about
the
trees
and
metaphors
take
us
at
once
into
dreamland
no
bad
place
either
this
garden
i
think
gets
more
and
more
like
a
dream
at
this
corner
of
the
day
and
night
that
might
lead
us
the
yellow
horn
of
the
moon
had
appeared
silently
and
as
if
suddenly
over
the
black
horns
of
the
seaweed
seeming
to
announce
as
night
something
which
till
then
had
been
evening
a
night
breeze
came
in
between
the
trees
and
raced
stealthily
across
the
turf
and
as
they
ceased
speaking
they
heard
not
only
the
seething
grass
but
the
sea
itself
move
and
sound
in
all
the
cracks
and
caves
round
them
and
below
them
and
on
every
side
they
all
felt
the
note
that
had
been
struck
the
american
as
an
art
critic
and
the
poet
as
a
poet
and
the
squire
who
believed
himself
boiling
with
an
impatience
purely
rational
did
not
really
understand
his
own
impatience
in
him
more
perhaps
than
the
others
more
certainly
than
he
knew
himself
the
sea
wind
went
to
the
head
like
wine
credulity
is
a
curious
thing
went
on
treherne
in
a
low
voice
it
is
more
negative
than
positive
and
yet
it
is
infinite
hundreds
of
men
will
avoid
walking
under
a
ladder
they
don
t
know
where
the
door
of
the
ladder
will
lead
they
don
t
really
think
god
would
throw
a
thunderbolt
at
them
for
such
a
thing
they
don
t
know
what
would
happen
that
is
just
the
point
but
yet
they
step
aside
as
from
a
precipice
so
the
poor
people
here
may
or
may
not
believe
anything
they
don
t
go
into
those
trees
at
i
walk
under
a
ladder
whenever
i
can
cried
vane
in
quite
unnecessary
excitement
you
belong
to
a
thirteen
club
said
the
poet
you
walk
under
a
ladder
on
friday
to
dine
thirteen
at
a
table
everybody
spilling
the
salt
but
even
you
don
t
go
into
those
trees
at
squire
vane
stood
up
his
silver
hair
flaming
in
the
wind
i
ll
stop
all
night
in
your
tomfool
wood
and
up
your
tomfool
trees
he
said
i
ll
do
it
for
twopence
or
two
thousand
pounds
if
anyone
will
take
the
without
waiting
for
reply
he
snatched
up
his
wide
white
hat
and
settled
it
on
with
a
fierce
gesture
and
had
gone
off
in
great
leonine
strides
across
the
lawn
before
anyone
at
the
table
could
move
the
stillness
was
broken
by
miles
the
butler
who
dropped
and
broke
one
of
the
plates
he
carried
he
stood
looking
after
his
master
with
his
long
angular
chin
thrust
out
looking
yellower
where
it
caught
the
yellow
light
of
the
lamp
below
his
face
was
thus
sharply
in
shadow
but
paynter
fancied
for
a
moment
it
was
convulsed
by
some
passion
passing
surprise
but
the
face
was
quite
as
usual
when
it
turned
and
paynter
realized
that
a
night
of
fancies
had
begun
like
the
cross
purposes
of
the
midsummer
night
s
the
wood
of
the
strange
trees
toward
which
the
squire
was
walking
lay
so
far
forward
on
the
headland
which
ultimately
almost
overhung
the
sea
that
it
could
be
approached
by
only
one
path
which
shone
clearly
like
a
silver
ribbon
in
the
twilight
the
ribbon
ran
along
the
edge
of
the
cliff
where
the
single
row
of
deformed
trees
ran
beside
it
all
the
way
and
eventually
plunged
into
the
closer
mass
of
trees
by
one
natural
gateway
a
mere
gap
in
the
wood
looking
dark
like
a
lion
s
mouth
what
became
of
the
path
inside
could
not
be
seen
but
it
doubtless
led
round
the
hidden
roots
of
the
great
central
trees
the
squire
was
already
within
a
yard
or
two
of
this
dark
entry
when
his
daughter
rose
from
the
table
and
took
a
step
or
two
after
him
as
if
to
call
him
back
treherne
had
also
risen
and
stood
as
if
dazed
at
the
effect
of
his
idle
defiance
when
barbara
moved
he
seemed
to
recover
himself
and
stepping
after
her
said
something
which
paynter
did
not
hear
he
said
it
casually
and
even
distantly
enough
but
it
clearly
suggested
something
to
her
mind
for
after
a
moment
s
thought
she
nodded
and
walked
back
not
toward
the
table
but
apparently
toward
the
house
paynter
looked
after
her
with
a
momentary
curiosity
and
when
he
turned
again
the
squire
had
vanished
into
the
hole
in
the
wood
he
s
gone
said
treherne
with
a
clang
of
finality
in
his
tones
like
the
slamming
of
a
door
well
suppose
he
has
cried
the
lawyer
roused
at
the
voice
the
squire
can
go
into
his
own
wood
i
suppose
what
the
devil
s
all
the
fuss
about
paynter
don
t
tell
me
you
think
there
s
any
harm
in
that
plantation
of
no
i
don
t
said
paynter
throwing
one
leg
over
another
and
lighting
a
cigar
but
i
shall
stop
here
till
he
comes
very
well
said
ashe
shortly
i
ll
stop
with
you
if
only
to
see
the
end
of
this
the
doctor
said
nothing
but
he
also
kept
his
seat
and
accepted
one
of
the
american
s
cigars
if
treherne
had
been
attending
to
the
matter
he
might
have
noted
with
his
sardonic
superstition
a
curious
fact
that
while
all
three
men
were
tacitly
condemning
themselves
to
stay
out
all
night
if
necessary
all
by
one
blank
omission
or
oblivion
assumed
that
it
was
impossible
to
follow
their
host
into
the
wood
just
in
front
of
them
but
treherne
though
still
in
the
garden
had
wandered
away
from
the
garden
table
and
was
pacing
along
the
single
line
of
trees
against
the
dark
sea
they
had
in
their
regular
interstices
showing
the
sea
as
through
a
series
of
windows
something
of
the
look
of
the
ghost
or
skeleton
of
a
cloister
and
he
having
thrown
his
coat
once
more
over
his
neck
like
a
cape
passed
to
and
fro
like
the
ghost
of
some
not
very
sane
monk
all
these
men
whether
skeptics
or
mystics
looked
back
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
on
that
night
as
on
something
unnatural
they
sat
still
or
started
up
abruptly
and
paced
the
great
garden
in
long
detours
so
that
it
seemed
that
no
three
of
them
were
together
at
a
time
and
none
knew
who
would
be
his
companion
yet
their
rambling
remained
within
the
same
dim
and
mazy
space
they
fell
into
snatches
of
uneasy
slumber
these
were
very
brief
and
yet
they
felt
as
if
the
whole
sitting
strolling
or
occasional
speaking
had
been
parts
of
a
single
dream
paynter
woke
once
and
found
ashe
sitting
opposite
him
at
a
table
otherwise
empty
his
face
dark
in
shadow
and
his
like
the
red
eye
of
a
cyclops
until
the
lawyer
spoke
in
his
steady
voice
paynter
was
positively
afraid
of
him
he
answered
at
random
and
nodded
again
when
he
again
woke
the
lawyer
was
gone
and
what
was
opposite
him
was
the
bald
pale
brow
of
the
doctor
there
seemed
suddenly
something
ominous
in
the
familiar
fact
that
he
wore
spectacles
and
yet
the
vanishing
ashe
had
only
vanished
a
few
yards
away
for
he
turned
at
that
instant
and
strolled
back
to
the
table
with
a
jerk
paynter
realized
that
his
nightmare
was
but
a
trick
of
sleep
or
sleeplessness
and
spoke
in
his
natural
voice
but
rather
loud
so
you
ve
joined
us
again
where
s
treherne
oh
still
revolving
i
suppose
like
a
polar
bear
under
those
trees
on
the
cliff
replied
ashe
motioning
with
his
cigar
looking
at
what
an
older
and
you
will
forgive
me
for
thinking
a
somewhat
better
poet
called
the
sea
it
really
has
a
sort
of
purple
shade
look
at
paynter
looked
he
saw
the
sea
and
the
fantastic
trees
that
fringed
it
but
he
did
not
see
the
poet
the
cloister
was
already
empty
of
its
restless
monk
gone
somewhere
else
he
said
with
futility
far
from
characteristic
he
ll
be
back
here
presently
this
is
an
interesting
vigil
but
a
vigil
loses
some
of
its
intensity
when
you
can
t
keep
awake
ah
here
s
treherne
so
we
re
all
mustered
as
the
politician
said
when
colman
came
late
for
dinner
no
the
doctor
s
off
again
how
restless
we
all
are
the
poet
had
drawn
near
his
feet
were
falling
soft
on
the
grass
and
was
gazing
at
them
with
a
singular
attentiveness
it
will
soon
be
over
he
said
what
snapped
ashe
very
abruptly
the
night
of
course
replied
treherne
in
a
motionless
manner
the
darkest
hour
has
didn
t
some
other
minor
poet
remark
inquired
paynter
flippantly
that
the
darkest
hour
before
the
dawn
my
god
what
was
that
it
was
like
a
it
was
a
scream
replied
the
poet
the
scream
of
a
ashe
stood
up
his
strong
pale
face
against
his
red
hair
and
said
furiously
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
oh
perfectly
natural
causes
as
brown
would
say
replied
treherne
didn
t
the
squire
tell
us
the
trees
had
a
shrill
note
of
their
own
when
the
wind
blew
the
wind
s
beating
up
again
from
the
sea
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
there
was
a
storm
before
dawn
indeed
came
gradually
with
a
growing
noise
of
wind
and
the
purple
sea
began
to
boil
about
the
dark
volcanic
cliffs
the
first
change
in
the
sky
showed
itself
only
in
the
shapes
of
the
wood
and
the
single
stems
growing
darker
but
clearer
and
above
the
gray
clump
against
a
glimpse
of
growing
light
they
saw
aloft
the
evil
trinity
of
the
trees
in
their
long
lines
there
seemed
to
paynter
something
faintly
serpentine
and
even
spiral
he
could
almost
fancy
he
saw
them
slowly
revolving
as
in
some
cyclic
dance
but
this
again
was
but
a
last
delusion
of
dreamland
for
a
few
seconds
later
he
was
again
asleep
in
dreams
he
toiled
through
a
tangle
of
inconclusive
tales
each
filled
with
the
same
stress
and
noise
of
sea
and
sea
wind
and
above
and
outside
all
other
voices
the
wailing
of
the
trees
of
pride
when
he
woke
it
was
broad
day
and
a
bloom
of
early
light
lay
on
wood
and
garden
and
on
fields
and
farms
for
miles
away
the
comparative
common
sense
that
daylight
brings
even
to
the
sleepless
drew
him
alertly
to
his
feet
and
showed
him
all
his
companions
standing
about
the
lawn
in
similar
attitudes
of
expectancy
there
was
no
need
to
ask
what
they
were
expecting
they
were
waiting
to
hear
the
nocturnal
experiences
comic
or
commonplace
or
whatever
they
might
prove
to
be
of
that
eccentric
friend
whose
experiment
whether
from
some
subconscious
fear
or
some
fancy
of
honor
they
had
not
ventured
to
interrupt
hour
followed
hour
and
still
nothing
stirred
in
the
wood
save
an
occasional
bird
the
squire
like
most
men
of
his
type
was
an
early
riser
and
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
in
this
case
sleep
late
it
was
much
more
likely
in
the
excitement
in
which
he
had
left
them
that
he
would
not
sleep
at
all
yet
it
was
clear
that
he
must
be
sleeping
perhaps
by
some
reaction
from
a
strain
by
the
time
the
sun
was
high
in
heaven
ashe
the
lawyer
turning
to
the
others
spoke
abruptly
and
to
the
point
shall
we
go
into
the
wood
now
asked
paynter
and
almost
seemed
to
hesitate
i
will
go
in
said
treherne
simply
then
drawing
up
his
dark
head
in
answer
to
their
glances
he
added
no
do
not
trouble
yourselves
it
is
never
the
believer
who
is
for
the
second
time
they
saw
a
man
mount
the
white
curling
path
and
disappear
into
the
gray
tangled
wood
but
this
time
they
did
not
have
to
wait
long
to
see
him
again
a
few
minutes
later
he
reappeared
in
the
woodland
gateway
and
came
slowly
toward
them
across
the
grass
he
stopped
before
the
doctor
who
stood
nearest
and
said
something
it
was
repeated
to
the
others
and
went
round
the
ring
with
low
cries
of
incredulity
the
others
plunged
into
the
wood
and
returned
wildly
and
were
seen
speaking
to
others
again
who
gathered
from
the
house
the
wild
wireless
telegraphy
which
is
the
education
of
countryside
communities
spread
it
farther
and
farther
before
the
fact
itself
was
fully
realized
and
before
nightfall
a
quarter
of
the
county
knew
that
squire
vane
had
vanished
like
a
burst
bubble
widely
as
the
wild
story
was
repeated
and
patiently
as
it
was
pondered
it
was
long
before
there
was
even
the
beginning
of
a
sequel
to
it
in
the
interval
paynter
had
politely
removed
himself
from
the
house
of
mourning
or
rather
of
questioning
but
only
so
far
as
the
village
inn
for
barbara
vane
was
glad
of
the
traveler
s
experience
and
sympathy
in
addition
to
that
afforded
her
by
the
lawyer
and
doctor
as
old
friends
of
the
family
even
treherne
was
not
discouraged
from
his
occasional
visits
with
a
view
to
helping
the
hunt
for
the
lost
man
the
five
held
many
counsels
round
the
old
garden
table
at
which
the
unhappy
master
of
the
house
had
dined
for
the
last
time
and
barbara
wore
her
old
mask
of
stone
if
it
was
now
a
more
tragic
mask
she
had
shown
no
passion
after
the
first
morning
of
discovery
when
she
had
broken
forth
once
speaking
strangely
enough
in
the
view
of
some
of
her
hearers
she
had
come
slowly
out
of
the
house
to
which
her
own
or
some
one
else
s
wisdom
had
relegated
her
during
the
night
of
the
wager
and
it
was
clear
from
her
face
that
somebody
had
told
her
the
truth
miles
the
butler
stood
on
the
steps
behind
her
and
it
was
probably
he
do
not
be
much
distressed
miss
vane
said
doctor
brown
in
a
low
and
rather
uncertain
voice
the
search
in
the
wood
has
hardly
begun
i
am
convinced
we
shall
find
something
quite
the
doctor
is
right
said
ashe
in
his
firm
tones
i
myself
the
doctor
is
not
right
said
the
girl
turning
a
white
face
on
the
speaker
i
know
better
the
poet
is
right
the
poet
is
always
right
oh
he
has
been
here
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
seen
wonders
and
terrors
that
are
all
round
our
path
and
only
hiding
behind
a
bush
or
a
stone
you
and
your
doctoring
and
your
science
why
you
have
only
been
here
for
a
few
fumbling
generations
and
you
can
t
conquer
even
your
own
enemies
of
the
flesh
oh
forgive
me
doctor
i
know
you
do
splendidly
but
the
fever
comes
in
the
village
and
the
people
die
and
die
for
all
that
and
now
it
s
my
poor
father
god
help
us
all
the
only
thing
left
is
to
believe
in
god
for
we
can
t
help
believing
in
and
she
left
them
still
walking
quite
slowly
but
in
such
a
fashion
that
no
one
could
go
after
her
the
spring
had
already
begun
to
ripen
into
summer
and
spread
a
green
tent
from
the
tree
over
the
garden
table
when
the
american
visitor
sitting
there
with
his
two
professional
companions
broke
the
silence
by
saying
what
had
long
been
in
his
mind
well
he
said
i
suppose
whatever
we
may
think
it
wise
to
say
we
have
all
begun
to
think
of
a
possible
conclusion
it
can
t
be
put
very
delicately
anyhow
but
after
all
there
s
a
very
necessary
business
side
to
it
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
poor
vane
s
affairs
apart
from
himself
i
suppose
you
know
he
added
in
a
low
voice
to
the
lawyer
whether
he
made
a
will
he
left
everything
to
his
daughter
unconditionally
replied
ashe
but
nothing
can
be
done
with
it
there
s
no
proof
whatever
that
he
s
no
legal
proof
remarked
paynter
dryly
a
wrinkle
of
irritation
had
appeared
in
the
big
bald
brow
of
doctor
brown
and
he
made
an
impatient
movement
of
course
he
s
dead
he
said
what
s
the
sense
of
all
this
legal
fuss
we
were
watching
this
side
of
the
wood
weren
t
we
a
man
couldn
t
have
flown
off
those
high
cliffs
over
the
sea
he
could
only
have
fallen
off
what
else
can
he
be
but
dead
i
speak
as
a
lawyer
returned
ashe
raising
his
eyebrows
we
can
t
presume
his
death
or
have
an
inquest
or
anything
till
we
find
the
poor
fellow
s
body
or
some
remains
that
may
reasonably
be
presumed
to
be
his
i
see
observed
paynter
quietly
you
speak
as
a
lawyer
but
i
don
t
think
it
s
very
hard
to
guess
what
you
think
as
a
i
own
i
d
rather
be
a
man
than
a
lawyer
said
the
doctor
rather
roughly
i
d
no
notion
the
law
was
such
an
ass
what
s
the
good
of
keeping
the
poor
girl
out
of
her
property
and
the
estate
all
going
to
pieces
well
i
must
be
off
or
my
patients
will
be
going
to
pieces
and
with
a
curt
salutation
he
pursued
his
path
down
to
the
village
that
man
does
his
duty
if
anybody
does
remarked
paynter
we
must
pardon
his
shall
i
say
manners
or
manner
oh
i
bear
him
no
malice
replied
ashe
but
i
m
glad
he
s
gone
because
well
because
i
don
t
want
him
to
know
how
jolly
right
he
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
stared
up
at
the
roof
of
green
leaves
you
are
sure
said
paynter
looking
at
the
table
that
squire
vane
is
dead
more
than
that
said
ashe
still
staring
at
the
leaves
i
m
sure
of
how
he
ah
said
the
american
with
an
intake
of
breath
and
they
remained
for
a
moment
one
gazing
at
the
tree
and
the
other
at
the
table
sure
is
perhaps
too
strong
a
word
continued
ashe
but
my
conviction
will
want
some
shaking
i
don
t
envy
the
counsel
for
the
the
counsel
for
the
defense
repeated
paynter
and
looked
up
quickly
at
his
companion
he
was
struck
again
by
the
man
s
napoleonic
chin
and
jaw
as
he
had
been
when
they
first
talked
of
the
legend
of
securis
then
he
began
you
don
t
think
the
trees
the
trees
be
damned
snorted
the
lawyer
the
tree
had
two
legs
on
that
evening
what
our
friend
the
poet
he
added
with
a
sneer
would
call
a
walking
tree
apropos
of
our
friend
the
poet
you
seemed
surprised
that
night
to
find
he
was
not
walking
poetically
by
the
sea
all
the
time
and
i
fear
i
affected
to
share
your
ignorance
i
was
not
so
sure
then
as
i
am
sure
of
what
demanded
the
other
to
begin
with
said
ashe
i
m
sure
our
friend
the
poet
followed
vane
into
the
wood
that
night
for
i
saw
him
coming
out
paynter
leaned
forward
suddenly
pale
with
excitement
and
struck
the
wooden
table
so
that
it
rattled
mr
ashe
you
re
wrong
he
cried
you
re
a
wonderful
man
and
you
re
wrong
you
ve
probably
got
tons
of
true
convincing
evidence
and
you
re
wrong
i
know
this
poet
i
know
him
as
a
poet
and
that
s
just
what
you
don
t
i
know
you
think
he
gave
you
crooked
answers
and
seemed
to
be
all
smiles
and
black
looks
at
once
but
you
don
t
understand
the
type
i
know
now
why
you
don
t
understand
the
irish
sometimes
you
think
it
s
soft
and
sometimes
sly
and
sometimes
murderous
and
sometimes
uncivilized
and
all
the
time
it
s
only
civilized
quivering
with
the
sensitive
irony
of
understanding
all
that
you
don
t
well
said
ashe
shortly
we
ll
see
who
s
we
will
cried
cyprian
and
rose
suddenly
from
the
table
all
the
drooping
of
the
aesthete
had
dropped
from
him
his
yankee
accent
rose
high
like
a
horn
of
defiance
and
there
was
nothing
about
him
but
the
new
world
i
guess
i
will
look
into
this
myself
he
said
stretching
his
long
limbs
like
an
athlete
i
search
that
little
wood
of
yours
it
s
a
bit
late
or
i
d
do
it
the
wood
has
been
searched
said
the
lawyer
rising
also
yes
drawled
the
american
it
s
been
searched
by
servants
policemen
local
policeman
and
quite
a
lot
of
people
and
do
you
know
i
have
a
notion
that
nobody
round
here
is
likely
to
have
searched
it
at
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
asked
ashe
what
i
bet
they
haven
t
done
replied
cyprian
i
m
going
to
climb
a
and
with
a
quaint
air
of
renewed
cheerfulness
he
took
himself
away
at
a
rapid
walk
to
his
inn
he
appeared
at
daybreak
next
morning
outside
the
vane
arms
with
all
the
air
of
one
setting
out
on
his
travels
in
distant
lands
he
had
a
field
glass
slung
over
his
shoulder
and
a
very
large
sheath
knife
buckled
by
a
belt
round
his
waist
and
carried
with
the
cool
bravado
of
the
bowie
knife
of
a
cowboy
but
in
spite
of
this
backwoodsman
s
simplicity
or
perhaps
rather
because
of
it
he
eyed
with
rising
relish
the
picturesque
plan
and
sky
line
of
the
antiquated
village
and
especially
the
wooden
square
of
the
old
inn
sign
that
hung
over
his
head
a
shield
of
which
the
charges
seemed
to
him
a
mere
medley
of
blue
dolphins
gold
crosses
and
scarlet
birds
the
colors
and
cubic
corners
of
that
painted
board
pleased
him
like
a
play
or
a
puppet
show
he
stood
staring
and
straddling
for
some
moments
on
the
cobbles
of
the
little
market
place
then
he
gave
a
short
laugh
and
began
to
mount
the
steep
streets
toward
the
high
park
and
garden
beyond
from
the
high
lawn
above
the
tree
and
table
he
could
see
on
one
side
the
land
stretch
away
past
the
house
into
a
great
rolling
plain
which
under
the
clear
edges
of
the
dawn
seemed
dotted
with
picturesque
details
the
woods
here
and
there
on
the
plain
looked
like
green
hedgehogs
as
grotesque
as
the
incongruous
beasts
found
unaccountably
walking
in
the
blank
spaces
of
mediaeval
maps
the
land
cut
up
into
colored
fields
recalled
the
heraldry
of
the
signboard
this
also
was
at
once
ancient
and
gay
on
the
other
side
the
ground
to
seaward
swept
down
and
then
up
again
to
the
famous
or
infamous
wood
the
square
of
strange
trees
lay
silently
tilted
on
the
slope
also
suggesting
if
not
a
map
or
least
a
bird
view
only
the
triple
centerpiece
of
the
peacock
trees
rose
clear
of
the
sky
line
and
these
stood
up
in
tranquil
sunlight
as
things
almost
classical
a
triangular
temple
of
the
winds
they
seemed
pagan
in
a
newer
and
more
placid
sense
and
he
felt
a
newer
and
more
boyish
curiosity
and
courage
for
the
consulting
of
the
oracle
in
all
his
wanderings
he
had
never
walked
so
lightly
for
the
connoisseur
of
sensations
had
found
something
to
do
at
last
he
was
fighting
for
a
friend
he
was
brought
to
a
standstill
once
however
and
that
at
the
very
gateway
of
the
garden
of
the
trees
of
knowledge
just
outside
the
black
entry
of
the
wood
now
curtained
with
greener
and
larger
leafage
he
came
on
a
solitary
figure
it
was
martin
the
woodcutter
wading
in
the
bracken
and
looking
about
him
in
rather
a
lost
fashion
the
man
seemed
to
be
talking
to
himself
i
dropped
it
here
he
was
saying
but
i
ll
never
work
with
it
again
i
reckon
doctor
wouldn
t
let
me
pick
it
up
when
i
wanted
to
pick
it
up
and
now
they
ve
got
it
like
they
ve
got
the
squire
wood
and
iron
wood
and
iron
but
eating
it
s
nothing
to
come
said
paynter
kindly
remembering
the
man
s
domestic
trouble
miss
vane
will
see
you
have
anything
you
want
i
know
and
look
here
don
t
brood
on
all
those
stories
about
the
squire
is
there
the
slightest
trace
of
the
trees
having
anything
to
do
with
it
is
there
even
this
extra
branch
the
idiots
talked
about
there
had
been
growing
on
paynter
the
suspicion
that
the
man
before
him
was
not
perfectly
sane
yet
he
was
much
more
startled
by
the
sudden
and
cold
sanity
that
looked
for
an
instant
out
of
the
woodman
s
eyes
as
he
answered
in
his
ordinary
manner
well
sir
did
you
count
the
branches
before
then
he
seemed
to
relapse
and
paynter
left
him
wandering
and
wavering
in
the
undergrowth
and
entered
the
wood
like
one
across
whose
sunny
path
a
shadow
has
fallen
for
an
instant
diving
under
the
wood
he
was
soon
threading
a
leafy
path
which
even
under
that
summer
sun
shone
only
with
an
emerald
twilight
as
if
it
were
on
the
floor
of
the
sea
it
wound
about
more
shakily
than
he
had
supposed
as
if
resolved
to
approach
the
central
trees
as
if
they
were
the
heart
of
the
maze
at
hampton
court
they
were
the
heart
of
the
maze
for
him
anyhow
he
sought
them
as
straight
as
a
crooked
road
would
carry
him
and
turning
a
final
corner
he
beheld
for
the
first
time
the
foundations
of
those
towers
of
vegetation
he
had
as
yet
only
seen
from
above
as
they
stood
in
the
woodland
he
found
the
suspicion
correct
which
supposed
the
tree
branched
from
one
great
root
like
a
candelabrum
the
fork
though
stained
and
slimy
with
green
fungoids
was
quite
near
the
ground
and
offered
a
first
foothold
he
put
his
foot
in
it
and
without
a
flash
of
hesitation
went
aloft
like
jack
climbing
the
bean
stalk
above
him
the
green
roof
of
leaves
and
boughs
seemed
sealed
like
a
firmament
of
foliage
but
by
bending
and
breaking
the
branches
to
right
and
left
he
slowly
forced
a
passage
upward
and
had
at
last
and
suddenly
the
sensation
coming
out
on
the
top
of
the
world
he
felt
as
if
he
had
never
been
in
the
open
air
before
sea
and
land
lay
in
a
circle
below
and
about
him
as
he
sat
astride
a
branch
of
the
tall
tree
he
was
almost
surprised
to
see
the
sun
still
comparatively
low
in
the
sky
as
if
he
were
looking
over
a
land
of
eternal
sunrise
silent
upon
a
peak
in
darien
he
remarked
in
a
needlessly
loud
and
cheerful
voice
and
though
the
claim
thus
expressed
was
illogical
it
was
not
inappropriate
he
did
feel
as
if
he
were
a
primitive
adventurer
just
come
to
the
new
world
instead
of
a
modern
traveler
just
come
from
it
i
wonder
he
proceeded
whether
i
am
really
the
first
that
ever
burst
into
this
silent
tree
it
looks
like
it
those
he
stopped
and
sat
on
his
branch
quite
motionless
but
his
eyes
were
turned
on
a
branch
a
little
below
it
and
they
were
brilliant
with
a
vigilance
like
those
of
a
man
watching
a
snake
what
he
was
looking
at
might
at
first
sight
have
been
a
large
white
fungus
spreading
on
the
smooth
and
monstrous
trunk
but
it
was
not
leaning
down
dangerously
from
his
perch
he
detached
it
from
the
twig
on
which
it
had
caught
and
then
sat
holding
it
in
his
hand
and
gazing
at
it
it
was
squire
vane
s
white
panama
hat
but
there
was
no
squire
vane
under
it
paynter
felt
a
nameless
relief
in
the
very
fact
that
there
was
not
there
in
the
clear
sunlight
and
sea
air
for
an
instant
all
the
tropical
terrors
of
his
own
idle
tale
surrounded
and
suffocated
him
it
seemed
indeed
some
demon
tree
of
the
swamps
a
vegetable
serpent
that
fed
on
men
even
the
hideous
farce
in
the
fancy
of
digesting
a
whole
man
with
the
exception
of
his
hat
seemed
only
to
simplify
the
nightmare
and
he
found
himself
gazing
dully
at
one
leaf
of
the
tree
which
happened
to
be
turned
toward
him
so
that
the
odd
markings
which
had
partly
made
the
legend
really
looked
a
little
like
the
eye
in
a
peacock
s
feather
it
was
as
if
the
sleeping
tree
had
opened
one
eye
upon
him
with
a
sharp
effort
he
steadied
himself
in
mind
and
posture
on
the
bough
his
reason
returned
and
he
began
to
descend
with
the
hat
in
his
teeth
when
he
was
back
in
the
underworld
of
the
wood
he
studied
the
hat
again
and
with
closer
attention
in
one
place
in
the
crown
there
was
a
hole
or
rent
which
certainly
had
not
been
there
when
it
had
last
lain
on
the
table
under
the
garden
tree
he
sat
down
lit
a
cigarette
and
reflected
for
a
long
time
a
wood
even
a
small
wood
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
search
minutely
but
he
provided
himself
with
some
practical
tests
in
the
matter
in
one
sense
the
very
density
of
the
thicket
was
a
help
he
could
at
least
see
where
anyone
had
strayed
from
the
path
by
broken
and
trampled
growths
of
every
kind
after
many
hours
industry
he
had
made
a
sort
of
new
map
of
the
place
and
had
decided
beyond
doubt
that
some
person
or
persons
had
so
strayed
for
some
purpose
in
several
defined
directions
there
was
a
way
burst
through
the
bushes
making
a
short
cut
across
a
loop
of
the
wandering
path
there
was
another
forking
out
from
it
as
an
alternative
way
into
the
central
space
but
there
was
one
especially
which
was
unique
and
which
seemed
to
him
the
more
he
studied
it
to
point
to
some
essential
of
the
mystery
one
of
these
beaten
and
broken
tracks
went
from
the
space
under
the
peacock
trees
outward
into
the
wood
for
about
twenty
yards
and
then
stopped
beyond
that
point
not
a
twig
was
broken
nor
a
leaf
disturbed
it
had
no
exit
but
he
could
not
believe
that
it
had
no
goal
after
some
further
reflection
he
knelt
down
and
began
to
cut
away
grass
and
clay
with
his
knife
and
was
surprised
at
the
ease
with
which
they
detached
themselves
in
a
few
moments
a
whole
section
of
the
soil
lifted
like
a
lid
it
was
a
round
lid
and
presented
a
quaint
appearance
like
a
flat
cap
with
green
feathers
for
though
the
disc
itself
was
made
of
wood
there
was
a
layer
of
earth
on
it
with
the
live
grass
still
growing
there
and
the
removal
of
the
round
lid
revealed
a
round
hole
black
as
night
and
seemingly
bottomless
paynter
understood
it
instantly
it
was
rather
near
the
sea
for
a
well
to
be
sunk
but
the
traveler
had
known
wells
sunk
even
nearer
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
the
great
knife
in
his
hand
a
frown
on
his
face
and
his
doubts
resolved
he
no
longer
shrank
from
naming
what
he
knew
this
was
not
the
first
corpse
that
had
been
thrown
down
a
well
here
without
stone
or
epitaph
was
the
grave
of
squire
vane
in
a
flash
all
the
mythological
follies
about
saints
and
peacocks
were
forgotten
he
was
knocked
on
the
head
as
with
a
stone
club
by
the
human
common
sense
of
crime
cyprian
paynter
stood
long
by
the
well
in
the
wood
walked
round
it
in
meditation
examined
its
rim
and
the
ring
of
grass
about
it
searched
the
surrounding
soil
thoroughly
came
back
and
stood
beside
the
well
once
more
his
researches
and
reflections
had
been
so
long
that
he
had
not
realized
that
the
day
had
passed
and
that
the
wood
and
the
world
round
it
were
beginning
already
to
be
steeped
in
the
enrichment
of
evening
the
day
had
been
radiantly
calm
the
sea
seemed
to
be
as
still
as
the
well
and
the
well
was
as
still
as
a
mirror
and
then
quite
without
warning
the
mirror
moved
of
itself
like
a
living
thing
in
the
well
in
the
wood
the
water
leapt
and
gurgled
with
a
grotesque
noise
like
something
swallowing
and
then
settled
again
with
a
second
sound
cyprian
could
not
see
into
the
well
clearly
for
the
opening
from
where
he
stood
was
an
ellipse
a
mere
slit
and
half
masked
by
thistles
and
rank
grass
like
a
green
beard
for
where
he
stood
now
was
three
yards
away
from
the
well
and
he
had
not
yet
himself
realized
that
he
had
sprung
back
all
that
distance
from
the
brink
when
the
water
spoke
iii
the
mystery
of
the
well
cyprian
paynter
did
not
know
what
he
expected
to
see
rise
out
of
the
well
the
corpse
of
the
murdered
man
or
merely
the
spirit
of
the
fountain
anyhow
neither
of
them
rose
out
of
it
and
he
recognized
after
an
instant
that
this
was
after
all
perhaps
the
more
natural
course
of
things
once
more
he
pulled
himself
together
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
well
and
looked
down
he
saw
as
before
a
dim
glimmer
of
water
at
that
depth
no
brighter
than
ink
he
fancied
he
still
heard
a
faint
convulsion
and
murmur
but
it
gradually
subsided
to
an
utter
stillness
short
of
suicidally
diving
in
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
he
realized
that
with
all
his
equipment
he
had
not
even
brought
anything
like
a
rope
or
basket
and
at
length
decided
to
return
for
them
as
he
retraced
his
steps
to
the
entrance
he
recurred
to
and
took
stock
of
his
more
solid
discoveries
somebody
had
gone
into
the
wood
killed
the
squire
and
thrown
him
down
the
well
but
he
did
not
admit
for
a
moment
that
it
was
his
friend
the
poet
but
if
the
latter
had
actually
been
seen
coming
out
of
the
wood
the
matter
was
serious
as
he
walked
the
rapidly
darkening
twilight
was
cloven
with
red
gleams
that
made
him
almost
fancy
for
a
moment
that
some
fantastic
criminal
had
set
fire
to
the
tiny
forest
as
he
fled
a
second
glance
showed
him
nothing
but
one
of
those
red
sunsets
in
which
such
serene
days
sometimes
close
as
he
came
out
of
the
gloomy
gate
of
trees
into
the
full
glow
he
saw
a
dark
figure
standing
quite
still
in
the
dim
bracken
on
the
spot
where
he
had
left
the
woodcutter
it
was
not
the
woodcutter
it
was
topped
by
a
tall
black
hat
of
a
funeral
type
and
the
whole
figure
stood
so
black
against
the
field
of
crimson
fire
that
edged
the
sky
line
that
he
could
not
for
an
instant
understand
or
recall
it
when
he
did
it
was
with
an
odd
change
in
the
whole
channel
of
his
thoughts
doctor
brown
he
cried
why
what
are
you
doing
up
here
i
have
been
talking
to
poor
martin
answered
the
doctor
and
made
a
rather
awkward
movement
with
his
hand
toward
the
road
down
to
the
village
following
the
gesture
paynter
dimly
saw
another
dark
figure
walking
down
in
the
distance
he
also
saw
that
the
hand
motioning
was
really
black
and
not
merely
in
shadow
and
coming
nearer
found
the
doctor
s
dress
was
really
funereal
down
to
the
detail
of
the
dark
gloves
it
gave
the
american
a
small
but
queer
shock
as
if
this
were
actually
an
undertaker
come
up
to
bury
the
corpse
that
could
not
be
found
poor
martin
s
been
looking
for
his
chopper
observed
doctor
brown
but
i
told
him
i
d
picked
it
up
and
kept
it
for
him
between
ourselves
i
hardly
think
he
s
fit
to
be
trusted
with
then
seeing
the
glance
at
his
black
garb
he
added
i
ve
just
been
to
a
funeral
did
you
know
there
s
been
another
loss
poor
jake
the
fisherman
s
wife
down
in
the
cottage
on
the
shore
you
know
this
infernal
fever
of
as
they
both
turned
facing
the
red
evening
light
paynter
instinctively
made
a
closer
study
not
merely
of
the
doctor
s
clothes
but
of
the
doctor
burton
brown
was
a
tall
alert
man
neatly
dressed
who
would
otherwise
have
had
an
almost
military
air
but
for
his
spectacles
and
an
almost
painful
intellectualism
in
his
lean
brown
face
and
bald
brow
the
contrast
was
clinched
by
the
fact
that
while
his
face
was
of
the
ascetic
type
generally
conceived
as
he
had
a
strip
of
dark
mustache
cut
too
short
for
him
to
bite
and
yet
a
mouth
that
often
moved
as
if
trying
to
bite
it
he
might
have
been
a
very
intelligent
army
surgeon
but
he
had
more
the
look
of
an
engineer
or
one
of
those
services
that
combine
a
military
silence
with
a
more
than
military
science
paynter
had
always
respected
something
ruggedly
reliable
about
the
man
and
after
a
little
hesitation
he
told
him
all
the
discoveries
the
doctor
took
the
hat
of
the
dead
squire
in
his
hand
and
examined
it
with
frowning
care
he
put
one
finger
through
the
hole
in
the
crown
and
moved
it
meditatively
and
paynter
realized
how
fanciful
his
own
fatigue
must
have
made
him
for
so
silly
a
thing
as
the
black
finger
waggling
through
the
rent
in
that
frayed
white
relic
unreasonably
displeased
him
the
doctor
soon
made
the
same
discovery
with
professional
acuteness
and
applied
it
much
further
for
when
paynter
began
to
tell
him
of
the
moving
water
in
the
well
he
looked
at
him
a
moment
through
his
spectacles
and
then
said
did
you
have
any
lunch
paynter
for
the
first
time
realized
that
he
had
as
a
fact
worked
and
thought
furiously
all
day
without
food
please
don
t
fancy
i
mean
you
had
too
much
lunch
said
the
medical
man
with
mournful
humor
on
the
contrary
i
mean
you
had
too
little
i
think
you
are
a
bit
knocked
out
and
your
nerves
exaggerate
things
anyhow
let
me
advise
you
not
to
do
any
more
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
without
ropes
or
some
sort
of
fishing
tackle
if
with
that
but
i
think
i
can
get
you
some
of
the
sort
of
grappling
irons
the
fishermen
use
for
dragging
poor
jake
s
got
some
i
know
i
ll
bring
them
round
to
you
tomorrow
morning
the
fact
is
i
m
staying
there
for
a
bit
as
he
s
rather
in
a
state
and
i
think
is
better
for
me
to
ask
for
the
things
and
not
a
stranger
i
am
sure
you
ll
paynter
understood
sufficiently
to
assent
and
hardly
knew
why
he
stood
vacantly
watching
the
doctor
make
his
way
down
the
steep
road
to
the
shore
and
the
fisher
s
cottage
then
he
threw
off
thoughts
he
had
not
examined
or
even
consciously
entertained
and
walked
slowly
and
rather
heavily
back
to
the
vane
arms
the
doctor
still
funereal
in
manner
though
no
longer
so
in
costume
appeared
punctually
under
the
wooden
sign
next
morning
laden
with
what
he
had
promised
an
apparatus
of
hooks
and
a
hanging
net
for
hoisting
up
anything
sunk
to
a
reasonable
depth
he
was
about
to
proceed
on
his
professional
round
and
said
nothing
further
to
deter
the
american
from
proceeding
on
his
own
very
unprofessional
experiment
as
a
detective
that
buoyant
amateur
had
indeed
recovered
most
if
not
all
of
yesterday
s
buoyancy
was
now
well
fitted
to
pass
any
medical
examination
and
returned
with
all
his
own
energy
to
the
scene
of
yesterday
s
labors
it
may
well
have
brightened
and
made
breezier
his
second
day
s
toil
that
he
had
not
only
the
sunlight
and
the
bird
s
singing
in
the
little
wood
to
say
nothing
of
a
more
scientific
apparatus
to
work
with
but
also
human
companionship
and
that
of
the
most
intelligent
type
after
leaving
the
doctor
and
before
leaving
the
village
he
had
bethought
himself
of
seeking
the
little
court
or
square
where
stood
the
quiet
brown
house
of
andrew
ashe
solicitor
and
the
operations
of
dragging
were
worked
in
double
harness
two
heads
were
peering
over
the
well
in
the
wood
one
lean
and
eager
the
other
redhaired
heavy
and
pondering
and
if
it
be
true
that
two
heads
are
better
than
one
it
is
truer
that
four
hands
are
better
than
two
in
any
case
their
united
and
repeated
efforts
bore
fruit
at
last
if
anything
so
hard
and
meager
and
forlorn
can
be
called
a
fruit
it
weighed
loosely
in
the
net
as
it
was
lifted
and
rolled
out
on
the
grassy
edge
of
the
well
it
was
a
bone
ashe
picked
it
up
and
stood
with
it
in
his
hand
frowning
we
want
doctor
brown
here
he
said
this
may
be
the
bone
of
some
animal
any
dog
or
sheep
might
fall
into
a
hidden
then
he
broke
off
for
his
companion
was
already
detaching
a
second
bone
from
the
net
after
another
half
hour
s
effort
paynter
had
occasion
to
remark
it
must
have
been
rather
a
large
there
were
already
a
heap
of
such
white
fragments
at
his
feet
i
have
seen
nothing
yet
said
ashe
speaking
more
plainly
that
is
certainly
a
human
i
fancy
this
must
be
a
human
bone
said
the
american
and
he
turned
away
a
little
as
he
handed
the
other
a
skull
there
was
no
doubt
of
what
sort
of
skull
there
was
the
one
unique
curve
that
holds
the
mystery
of
reason
and
underneath
it
the
two
black
holes
that
had
held
human
eyes
but
just
above
that
on
the
left
was
another
and
smaller
black
hole
which
was
not
an
eye
then
the
lawyer
said
with
something
like
an
effort
we
may
admit
it
is
a
man
without
admitting
it
is
any
particular
man
there
may
be
something
after
all
in
that
yarn
about
the
drunkard
he
may
have
tumbled
into
the
well
under
certain
conditions
after
certain
natural
processes
i
fancy
the
bones
might
be
stripped
in
this
way
even
without
the
skill
of
any
assassin
we
want
the
doctor
then
he
added
suddenly
and
the
very
sound
of
his
voice
suggested
that
he
hardly
believed
his
own
words
haven
t
you
got
poor
vane
s
hat
there
he
took
it
from
the
silent
american
s
hand
and
with
a
sort
of
hurry
fitted
it
on
the
bony
head
don
t
said
the
other
involuntarily
the
lawyer
had
put
his
finger
as
the
doctor
had
done
through
the
hole
in
the
hat
and
it
lay
exactly
over
the
hole
in
the
skull
i
have
the
better
right
to
shrink
he
said
steadily
but
in
a
vibrant
voice
i
think
i
am
the
older
paynter
nodded
without
speech
accepting
the
final
identification
the
last
doubt
or
hope
had
departed
and
he
turned
to
the
dragging
apparatus
and
did
not
speak
till
he
had
made
his
last
find
the
singing
of
the
birds
seemed
to
grow
louder
about
them
and
the
dance
of
the
green
summer
leaves
was
repeated
beyond
in
the
dance
of
the
green
summer
sea
only
the
great
roots
of
the
mysterious
trees
could
be
seen
the
rest
being
far
aloft
and
all
round
it
was
a
wood
of
little
lively
and
happy
things
they
might
have
been
two
innocent
naturalists
or
even
two
children
fishing
for
eels
or
tittlebats
on
that
summer
holiday
when
paynter
pulled
up
something
that
weighed
in
the
net
more
heavily
than
any
bone
it
nearly
broke
the
meshes
and
fell
against
a
mossy
stone
with
a
clang
truth
lies
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
cried
the
american
with
lift
in
his
voice
the
woodman
s
it
lay
indeed
flat
and
gleaming
in
the
grasses
by
the
well
in
the
wood
just
as
it
had
lain
in
the
thicket
where
the
woodman
threw
it
in
the
beginning
of
all
these
things
but
on
one
corner
of
the
bright
blade
was
a
dull
brown
stain
i
see
said
ashe
the
woodman
s
ax
and
therefore
the
woodman
your
deductions
are
my
deductions
are
reasonable
said
paynter
look
here
ashe
i
know
what
you
re
thinking
i
know
you
distrust
treherne
but
i
m
sure
you
will
be
just
for
all
that
to
begin
with
surely
the
first
assumption
is
that
the
woodman
s
ax
is
used
by
the
woodman
what
have
you
to
say
to
it
i
say
no
to
it
replied
the
lawyer
the
last
weapon
a
woodman
would
use
would
be
a
woodman
s
ax
that
is
if
he
is
a
sane
he
isn
t
said
paynter
quietly
you
said
you
wanted
the
doctor
s
opinion
just
now
the
doctor
s
opinion
on
this
point
is
the
same
as
my
own
we
both
found
him
meandering
about
outside
there
it
s
obvious
this
business
has
gone
to
his
head
at
any
rate
if
the
murderer
were
a
man
of
business
like
yourself
what
you
say
might
be
sound
but
this
murderer
is
a
mystic
he
was
driven
by
some
fanatical
fad
about
the
trees
it
s
quite
likely
he
thought
there
was
something
solemn
and
sacrificial
about
the
ax
and
would
have
liked
to
cut
off
vane
s
head
before
a
crowd
like
charles
i
s
he
s
looking
for
the
ax
still
and
probably
thinks
it
a
holy
for
which
reason
said
ashe
smiling
he
instantly
chucked
it
down
a
paynter
laughed
you
have
me
there
certainly
he
said
but
i
think
you
have
something
else
in
your
mind
you
ll
say
i
suppose
that
we
were
all
watching
the
wood
but
were
we
frankly
i
could
almost
fancy
the
peacock
trees
did
strike
me
with
a
sort
of
sickness
a
sleeping
well
admitted
ashe
you
have
me
there
too
i
m
afraid
i
couldn
t
swear
i
was
awake
all
the
time
but
i
don
t
put
it
down
to
magic
trees
only
to
a
private
hobby
of
going
to
bed
at
night
but
look
here
paynter
there
s
another
and
better
argument
against
any
outsider
from
the
village
or
countryside
having
committed
the
crime
granted
he
might
have
slipped
past
us
somehow
and
gone
for
the
squire
but
why
should
he
go
for
him
in
the
wood
how
did
he
know
he
was
in
the
wood
you
remember
how
suddenly
the
poor
old
boy
bolted
into
it
on
what
a
momentary
impulse
it
s
the
last
place
where
one
would
normally
look
for
such
a
man
in
the
middle
of
the
night
no
it
s
an
ugly
thing
to
say
but
we
the
group
round
that
garden
table
were
the
only
people
who
knew
which
brings
me
back
to
the
one
point
in
your
remarks
which
i
happen
to
think
perfectly
what
was
that
inquired
the
other
that
the
murderer
was
a
mystic
said
ashe
but
a
cleverer
mystic
than
poor
old
paynter
made
a
murmur
of
protest
and
then
fell
silent
let
us
talk
plainly
resumed
the
lawyer
treherne
had
all
those
mad
motives
you
yourself
admit
against
the
woodcutter
he
had
the
knowledge
of
vane
s
whereabouts
which
nobody
can
possibly
attribute
to
the
woodcutter
but
he
had
much
more
who
taunted
and
goaded
the
squire
to
go
into
the
wood
at
all
treherne
who
practically
prophesied
like
an
infernal
quack
astrologer
that
something
would
happen
to
him
if
he
did
go
into
the
wood
treherne
who
was
for
some
reason
no
matter
what
obviously
burning
with
rage
and
restlessness
all
that
night
kicking
his
legs
impatiently
to
and
fro
on
the
cliff
and
breaking
out
with
wild
words
about
it
being
all
over
soon
treherne
and
on
top
of
all
this
when
i
walked
closer
to
the
wood
whom
did
i
see
slip
out
of
it
swiftly
and
silently
like
a
shadow
but
turning
his
face
once
to
the
moon
on
my
oath
and
on
my
honor
it
is
awful
said
paynter
like
a
man
stunned
what
you
say
is
simply
yes
said
ashe
seriously
very
awful
but
very
simple
treherne
knew
where
the
ax
was
originally
thrown
i
saw
him
on
that
day
he
lunched
here
first
watching
it
like
a
wolf
while
miss
vane
was
talking
to
him
on
that
dreadful
night
he
could
easily
have
picked
it
up
as
he
went
into
the
wood
he
knew
about
the
well
no
doubt
who
was
so
likely
to
know
any
old
traditions
about
the
peacock
trees
he
hid
the
hat
in
the
trees
where
perhaps
he
hoped
though
the
point
is
unimportant
that
nobody
would
dare
to
look
anyhow
he
hid
it
simply
because
it
was
the
one
thing
that
would
not
sink
in
the
well
paynter
do
you
think
i
would
say
this
of
any
man
in
mere
mean
dislike
could
any
man
say
it
of
any
man
unless
the
case
was
complete
as
this
is
complete
it
is
complete
said
paynter
very
pale
i
have
nothing
left
against
it
but
a
faint
irrational
feeling
a
feeling
that
somehow
or
other
if
poor
vane
could
stand
alive
before
us
at
this
moment
he
might
tell
some
other
and
even
more
incredible
ashe
made
a
mournful
gesture
can
these
dry
bones
live
he
said
lord
thou
knowest
answered
the
other
mechanically
even
these
dry
bones
and
he
stopped
suddenly
with
his
mouth
open
a
blinding
light
of
wonder
in
his
pale
eyes
see
here
he
said
hoarsely
and
hastily
you
have
said
the
word
what
does
it
mean
what
can
it
mean
dry
why
are
these
bones
dry
the
lawyer
started
and
stared
down
at
the
heap
your
case
complete
cried
paynter
in
mounting
excitement
where
is
the
water
in
the
well
the
water
i
saw
leap
like
a
flame
why
did
it
leap
where
is
it
gone
to
complete
we
are
buried
under
ashe
stooped
picked
up
a
bone
and
looked
at
it
you
are
right
he
said
in
a
low
and
shaken
voice
this
bone
is
as
dry
as
a
yes
i
am
right
replied
cyprian
and
your
mystic
is
still
as
mysterious
as
a
there
was
a
long
silence
ashe
laid
down
the
bone
picked
up
the
ax
and
studied
it
more
closely
beyond
the
dull
stain
at
the
corner
of
the
steel
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
it
save
a
broad
white
rag
wrapped
round
the
handle
perhaps
to
give
a
better
grip
the
lawyer
thought
it
worth
noting
however
that
the
rag
was
certainly
newer
and
cleaner
than
the
chopper
but
both
were
quite
dry
mr
paynter
he
said
at
last
i
admit
you
have
scored
in
the
spirit
if
not
in
the
letter
in
strict
logic
this
greater
puzzle
is
not
a
reply
to
my
case
if
this
ax
has
not
been
dipped
in
water
it
has
been
dipped
in
blood
and
the
water
jumping
out
of
the
well
is
not
an
explanation
of
the
poet
jumping
out
of
the
wood
but
i
admit
that
morally
and
practically
it
does
make
a
vital
difference
we
are
not
faced
with
a
colossal
contradiction
and
we
don
t
know
how
far
it
extends
the
body
might
have
been
broken
up
or
boiled
down
to
its
bones
by
the
murderer
though
it
may
be
hard
to
connect
it
with
the
conditions
of
the
murder
it
might
conceivably
have
been
so
reduced
by
some
property
in
the
water
and
soil
for
decomposition
varies
vastly
with
these
things
i
should
not
dismiss
my
strong
prima
facie
case
against
the
likely
person
because
of
these
difficulties
but
here
we
have
something
entirely
different
that
the
bones
themselves
should
remain
dry
in
a
well
full
of
water
or
a
well
that
yesterday
was
full
of
water
that
brings
us
to
the
edge
of
something
beyond
which
we
can
make
no
guess
there
is
a
new
factor
enormous
and
quite
unknown
while
we
can
t
fit
together
such
prodigious
facts
we
can
t
fit
together
a
case
against
treherne
or
against
anybody
no
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
now
since
we
can
t
accuse
treherne
we
must
appeal
to
him
we
must
put
the
case
against
him
frankly
before
him
and
trust
he
has
an
explanation
and
will
give
it
i
suggest
we
go
back
and
do
it
paynter
beginning
to
follow
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
forgive
me
for
a
kind
of
liberty
as
you
say
you
are
an
older
friend
of
the
family
i
entirely
agree
with
your
suggestion
but
before
you
act
on
your
present
suspicions
do
you
know
i
think
miss
vane
ought
to
be
warned
a
little
i
rather
fear
all
this
will
be
a
new
shock
to
very
well
said
ashe
after
looking
at
him
steadily
for
an
instant
let
us
go
across
to
her
from
the
opening
of
the
wood
they
could
see
barbara
vane
writing
at
the
garden
table
which
was
littered
with
correspondence
and
the
butler
with
his
yellow
face
waiting
behind
her
chair
as
the
lengths
of
grass
lessened
between
them
and
the
little
group
at
the
table
grew
larger
and
clearer
in
the
sunlight
paynter
had
a
painful
sense
of
being
part
of
an
embassy
of
doom
it
sharpened
when
the
girl
looked
up
from
the
table
and
smiled
on
seeing
them
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
rather
particularly
if
i
may
said
the
lawyer
with
a
touch
of
authority
in
his
respect
and
when
the
butler
was
dismissed
he
laid
open
the
whole
matter
before
her
speaking
sympathetically
but
leaving
out
nothing
from
the
strange
escape
of
the
poet
from
the
wood
to
the
last
detail
of
the
dry
bones
out
of
the
well
no
fault
could
be
found
with
any
one
of
his
tones
or
phrases
and
yet
cyprian
tingling
in
every
nerve
with
the
fine
delicacy
of
his
nation
about
the
other
sex
felt
as
if
she
were
faced
with
an
inquisitor
he
stood
about
uneasily
watched
the
few
colored
clouds
in
the
clear
sky
and
the
bright
birds
darting
about
the
wood
and
he
heartily
wished
himself
up
the
tree
again
soon
however
the
way
the
girl
took
it
began
to
move
him
to
perplexity
rather
than
pity
it
was
like
nothing
he
had
expected
and
yet
he
could
not
name
the
shade
of
difference
the
final
identification
of
her
father
s
skull
by
the
hole
in
the
hat
turned
her
a
little
pale
but
left
her
composed
this
was
perhaps
explicable
since
she
had
from
the
first
taken
the
pessimistic
view
but
during
the
rest
of
the
tale
there
rested
on
her
broad
brows
under
her
copper
coils
of
hair
a
brooding
spirit
that
was
itself
a
mystery
he
could
only
tell
himself
that
she
was
less
merely
receptive
either
firmly
or
weakly
than
he
would
have
expected
it
was
as
if
she
revolved
not
their
problem
but
her
own
she
was
silent
a
long
time
and
said
at
last
thank
you
ashe
i
am
really
very
grateful
for
this
after
all
it
brings
things
to
the
point
where
they
must
have
come
sooner
or
she
looked
dreamily
at
the
wood
and
sea
and
went
on
i
ve
not
only
had
myself
to
consider
you
see
but
if
you
re
really
thinking
that
it
s
time
i
spoke
out
without
asking
anybody
you
say
as
if
it
were
something
very
dreadful
mr
treherne
was
in
the
wood
that
well
it
s
not
quite
so
dreadful
to
me
you
see
because
i
know
he
was
in
fact
we
were
there
together
repeated
the
lawyer
we
were
together
she
said
quietly
because
we
had
a
right
to
be
do
you
mean
stammered
ashe
surprised
out
of
himself
that
you
were
engaged
no
no
she
said
we
were
then
amid
a
startled
silence
she
added
as
a
kind
of
afterthought
in
fact
we
are
strong
as
was
his
composure
the
lawyer
sat
back
in
his
chair
with
a
sort
of
solid
stupefaction
at
which
paynter
could
not
help
smiling
you
will
ask
me
of
course
went
on
barbara
in
the
same
measured
manner
why
we
should
be
married
secretly
so
that
even
my
poor
father
did
not
know
well
i
answer
you
quite
frankly
to
begin
with
because
if
he
had
known
he
would
certainly
have
cut
me
off
with
a
shilling
he
did
not
like
my
husband
and
i
rather
fancy
you
do
not
like
him
either
and
when
i
tell
you
this
i
know
perfectly
well
what
you
will
say
the
usual
adventurer
getting
hold
of
the
usual
heiress
it
is
quite
reasonable
and
as
it
happens
it
is
quite
wrong
if
i
had
deceived
my
father
for
the
sake
of
the
money
or
even
for
the
sake
of
a
man
i
should
be
a
little
ashamed
to
talk
to
you
about
it
and
i
think
you
can
see
that
i
am
not
yes
said
the
american
with
a
grave
inclination
yes
i
can
see
she
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
as
if
seeking
words
for
an
obscure
matter
and
then
said
do
you
remember
paynter
that
day
you
first
lunched
here
and
told
us
about
the
african
trees
well
it
was
my
birthday
i
mean
my
first
birthday
i
was
born
then
or
woke
up
or
something
i
had
walked
in
this
garden
like
a
somnambulist
in
the
sun
i
think
there
are
many
such
somnambulists
in
our
set
and
our
society
stunned
with
health
drugged
with
good
manners
fitting
their
surroundings
too
well
to
be
alive
well
i
came
alive
somehow
and
you
know
how
deep
in
us
are
the
things
we
first
realize
when
we
were
babies
and
began
to
take
notice
i
began
to
take
notice
one
of
the
first
things
i
noticed
was
your
own
story
paynter
i
feel
as
if
i
heard
of
securis
as
children
hear
of
santa
claus
and
as
if
that
big
tree
were
a
bogey
i
still
believed
in
for
i
do
still
believe
in
such
things
or
rather
i
believe
in
them
more
and
more
i
feel
certain
my
poor
father
drove
on
the
rocks
by
disbelieving
and
you
are
all
racing
to
ruin
after
him
that
is
why
i
do
honestly
want
the
estate
and
that
is
why
i
am
not
ashamed
of
wanting
it
i
am
perfectly
certain
paynter
that
nobody
can
save
this
perishing
land
and
this
perishing
people
but
those
who
understand
i
mean
who
understand
a
thousand
little
signs
and
guides
in
the
very
soil
and
lie
of
the
land
and
traces
that
are
almost
trampled
out
my
husband
understands
and
i
have
begun
to
understand
my
father
would
never
have
understood
there
are
powers
there
is
the
spirit
of
a
place
there
are
presences
that
are
not
to
be
put
by
oh
don
t
fancy
i
am
sentimental
and
hanker
after
the
good
old
days
the
old
days
were
not
all
good
that
is
just
the
point
and
we
must
understand
enough
to
know
the
good
from
the
evil
we
must
understand
enough
to
save
the
traces
of
a
saint
or
a
sacred
tradition
or
where
a
wicked
god
has
been
worshiped
to
destroy
his
altar
and
to
cut
down
his
his
grove
said
paynter
automatically
and
looked
toward
the
little
wood
where
the
sunbright
birds
were
flying
mrs
treherne
said
ashe
with
a
formidable
quietness
i
am
not
so
unsympathetic
with
all
this
as
you
may
perhaps
suppose
i
will
not
even
say
it
is
all
moonshine
for
it
is
something
better
it
is
if
i
may
say
so
honeymoonshine
i
will
never
deny
the
saying
that
it
makes
the
world
go
round
if
it
makes
people
s
heads
go
round
too
but
there
are
other
sentiments
madam
and
other
duties
i
need
not
tell
you
your
father
was
a
good
man
and
that
what
has
befallen
him
would
be
pitiable
even
as
the
fate
of
the
wicked
this
is
a
horrible
thing
and
it
is
chiefly
among
horrors
that
we
must
keep
our
common
sense
there
are
reasons
for
everything
and
when
my
old
friend
lies
butchered
do
not
come
to
me
with
even
the
most
beautiful
fairy
tales
about
a
saint
and
his
enchanted
well
and
you
she
cried
and
rose
radiantly
and
swiftly
with
what
kind
of
fairy
tales
do
you
come
to
me
in
what
enchanted
groves
are
you
walking
you
come
and
tell
me
that
paynter
found
a
well
where
the
water
danced
and
then
disappeared
but
of
course
miracles
are
all
moonshine
you
tell
me
you
yourself
fished
bones
from
under
the
same
water
and
every
bone
was
as
dry
as
a
biscuit
but
for
heaven
s
sake
let
us
say
nothing
that
makes
anybody
s
head
go
round
really
ashe
you
must
try
to
preserve
your
common
sense
she
was
smiling
but
with
blazing
eyes
and
ashe
got
to
his
feet
with
an
involuntary
laugh
of
surrender
well
we
must
be
going
he
said
may
i
say
that
a
tribute
is
really
due
to
your
new
transcendental
training
if
i
may
say
so
i
always
knew
you
had
brains
and
you
ve
been
learning
to
use
the
two
amateur
detectives
went
back
to
the
wood
for
the
moment
that
ashe
might
consider
the
removal
of
the
unhappy
squire
s
remains
as
he
pointed
out
it
was
now
legally
possible
to
have
an
inquest
and
even
at
that
early
stage
of
investigations
he
was
in
favor
of
having
it
at
once
i
shall
be
the
coroner
he
said
and
i
think
it
will
be
a
case
of
some
person
or
persons
don
t
be
surprised
it
is
often
done
to
give
the
guilty
a
false
security
this
is
not
the
first
time
the
police
have
found
it
convenient
to
have
the
inquest
first
and
the
inquiry
but
paynter
had
paid
little
attention
to
the
point
for
his
great
gift
of
enthusiasm
long
wasted
on
arts
and
affectations
was
lifted
to
inspiration
by
the
romance
of
real
life
into
which
he
had
just
walked
he
was
really
a
great
critic
he
had
a
genius
for
admiration
and
his
admiration
varied
fittingly
with
everything
he
admired
a
splendid
girl
and
a
splendid
story
he
cried
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
love
again
myself
not
so
much
with
her
as
with
eve
or
helen
of
troy
or
some
such
tower
of
beauty
in
the
morning
of
the
world
don
t
you
love
all
heroic
things
that
gravity
and
great
candor
and
the
way
she
took
one
step
from
a
sort
of
throne
to
stand
in
a
wilderness
with
a
vagabond
oh
believe
me
it
is
she
who
is
the
poet
she
has
the
higher
reason
and
honor
and
valor
are
at
rest
in
her
in
short
she
is
uncommonly
pretty
replied
ashe
with
some
cynicism
i
knew
a
murderess
rather
well
who
was
very
much
like
her
and
had
just
that
colored
you
talk
as
if
a
murderer
could
be
caught
instead
of
retorted
paynter
why
at
this
very
minute
you
could
be
caught
yourself
are
you
a
murderer
by
any
chance
ashe
looked
up
quickly
and
then
smiled
i
m
afraid
i
m
a
connoisseur
in
murderers
as
you
are
in
poets
he
answered
and
i
assure
you
they
are
of
all
colors
in
hair
as
well
as
temperament
i
suppose
it
s
inhumane
but
mine
is
a
monstrously
interesting
trade
even
in
a
little
place
like
this
as
for
that
girl
of
course
i
ve
known
her
all
her
life
and
but
but
that
is
just
the
question
have
i
known
her
all
her
life
have
i
known
her
at
all
was
she
even
there
to
be
known
you
admire
her
for
telling
the
truth
and
so
she
did
by
god
when
she
said
that
some
people
wake
up
late
who
have
never
lived
before
do
we
know
what
they
might
do
we
who
have
only
seen
them
asleep
great
heavens
cried
paynter
you
don
t
dare
suggest
that
she
no
i
don
t
said
the
lawyer
with
composure
but
there
are
other
reasons
i
don
t
suggest
anything
fully
till
we
ve
had
our
interview
with
this
poet
of
yours
i
think
i
know
where
to
find
they
found
him
in
fact
before
they
expected
him
sitting
on
the
bench
outside
the
vane
arms
drinking
a
mug
of
cider
and
waiting
for
the
return
of
his
american
friend
so
it
was
not
difficult
to
open
conversation
with
him
nor
did
he
in
any
way
avoid
the
subject
of
the
tragedy
and
the
lawyer
seating
himself
also
on
the
long
bench
that
fronted
the
little
market
place
was
soon
putting
the
last
developments
as
lucidly
as
he
had
put
them
to
barbara
well
said
treherne
at
last
leaning
back
and
frowning
at
the
signboard
with
the
colored
birds
and
dolphins
just
about
his
head
suppose
somebody
did
kill
the
squire
he
d
killed
a
good
many
people
with
his
hygiene
and
his
enlightened
paynter
was
considerably
uneasy
at
this
alarming
opening
but
the
poet
went
on
quite
coolly
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
feet
thrust
out
into
the
street
when
a
man
has
the
power
of
a
sultan
in
turkey
and
uses
it
with
the
ideas
of
a
spinster
in
tooting
i
often
wonder
that
nobody
puts
a
knife
in
him
i
wish
there
were
more
sympathy
for
murderers
somehow
i
m
very
sorry
the
poor
old
fellow
s
gone
myself
but
you
gentlemen
always
seem
to
forget
there
are
any
other
people
in
the
world
he
s
all
right
he
was
a
good
fellow
and
his
soul
i
fancy
has
gone
to
the
happiest
paradise
of
the
anxious
american
could
read
nothing
of
the
effect
of
this
in
the
dark
napoleonic
face
of
the
lawyer
who
merely
said
what
do
you
mean
the
fool
s
paradise
said
treherne
and
drained
his
pot
of
cider
the
lawyer
rose
he
did
not
look
at
treherne
or
speak
to
him
but
looked
and
spoke
straight
across
him
to
the
american
who
found
the
utterance
not
a
little
unexpected
mr
paynter
said
ashe
you
thought
it
rather
morbid
of
me
to
collect
murderers
but
it
s
fortunate
for
your
own
view
of
the
case
that
i
do
it
may
surprise
you
to
know
that
treherne
has
now
in
my
eyes
entirely
cleared
himself
of
suspicion
i
have
been
intimate
with
several
assassins
as
i
remarked
but
there
s
one
thing
none
of
them
ever
did
i
never
knew
a
murderer
to
talk
about
the
murder
and
then
at
once
deny
it
and
defend
it
no
if
a
man
is
concealing
his
crime
why
should
he
go
out
of
his
way
to
apologize
for
it
well
said
paynter
with
his
ready
appreciation
i
always
said
you
were
a
remarkable
man
and
that
s
certainly
a
remarkable
do
i
understand
asked
the
poet
kicking
his
heels
on
the
cobbles
that
both
you
gentlemen
have
been
kindly
directing
me
toward
the
gallows
no
said
paynter
thoughtfully
i
never
thought
you
guilty
and
even
supposing
i
had
if
you
understand
me
i
should
never
have
thought
it
quite
so
guilty
to
be
guilty
it
would
not
have
been
for
money
or
any
mean
thing
but
for
something
a
little
wilder
and
worthier
of
a
man
of
genius
after
all
i
suppose
the
poet
has
passions
like
great
unearthly
appetites
and
the
world
has
always
judged
more
gently
of
his
sins
but
now
that
ashe
admits
your
innocence
i
can
honestly
say
i
have
always
affirmed
the
poet
rose
also
well
i
am
innocent
oddly
enough
he
said
i
think
i
can
make
a
guess
about
your
vanishing
well
but
of
the
death
and
dry
bones
i
know
no
more
than
the
dead
if
so
much
and
by
the
way
my
dear
paynter
and
he
turned
two
bright
eyes
on
the
art
critic
i
will
excuse
you
from
excusing
me
for
all
the
things
i
haven
t
done
and
you
i
hope
will
excuse
me
if
i
differ
from
you
altogether
about
the
morality
of
poets
as
you
suggest
it
is
a
fashionable
view
but
i
think
it
is
a
fallacy
no
man
has
less
right
to
be
lawless
than
a
man
of
imagination
for
he
has
spiritual
adventures
and
can
take
his
holidays
when
he
likes
i
could
picture
the
poor
squire
carried
off
to
elfland
whenever
i
wanted
him
carried
off
and
that
wood
needed
no
crime
to
make
it
wicked
for
me
that
red
sunset
the
other
night
was
all
that
a
murder
would
have
been
to
many
men
no
ashe
show
when
next
you
sit
in
judgment
a
little
mercy
to
some
wretched
man
who
drinks
and
robs
because
he
must
drink
beer
to
taste
it
and
take
it
to
drink
it
have
compassion
on
the
next
batch
of
poor
thieves
who
have
to
hold
things
in
order
to
have
them
but
if
ever
you
find
me
stealing
one
small
farthing
when
i
can
shut
my
eyes
and
see
the
city
of
el
dorado
then
and
he
lifted
his
head
like
a
falcon
show
me
no
mercy
for
i
shall
deserve
well
remarked
ashe
after
a
pause
i
must
go
and
fix
things
up
for
the
inquest
treherne
your
attitude
is
singularly
interesting
i
really
almost
wish
i
could
add
you
to
my
collection
of
murderers
they
are
a
varied
and
extraordinary
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
asked
paynter
that
perhaps
the
men
who
have
never
committed
murder
are
a
varied
and
very
extraordinary
set
perhaps
every
plain
man
s
life
holds
the
real
mystery
the
secret
of
sins
possibly
replied
ashe
it
would
be
a
long
business
to
stop
the
next
man
in
the
street
and
ask
him
what
crimes
he
never
committed
and
why
not
and
i
happen
to
be
busy
so
you
ll
excuse
what
asked
the
american
when
he
and
the
poet
were
alone
is
this
guess
of
yours
about
the
vanishing
water
well
i
m
not
sure
i
ll
tell
you
yet
answered
treherne
something
of
the
old
mischief
coming
back
into
his
dark
eyes
but
i
ll
tell
you
something
else
which
may
be
connected
with
it
something
i
couldn
t
tell
until
my
wife
had
told
you
about
our
meeting
in
the
his
face
had
grown
grave
again
and
he
resumed
after
a
pause
when
my
wife
started
to
follow
her
father
i
advised
her
to
go
back
first
to
the
house
to
leave
it
by
another
door
and
to
meet
me
in
the
wood
in
half
an
hour
we
often
made
these
assignations
of
course
and
generally
thought
them
great
fun
but
this
time
the
question
was
serious
and
i
didn
t
want
the
wrong
thing
done
in
a
hurry
it
was
a
question
whether
anything
could
be
done
to
undo
an
experiment
we
both
vaguely
felt
to
be
dangerous
and
she
especially
thought
after
reflection
that
interference
would
make
things
worse
she
thought
the
old
sportsman
having
been
dared
to
do
something
would
certainly
not
be
dissuaded
by
the
very
man
who
had
dared
him
or
by
a
woman
whom
he
regarded
as
a
child
she
left
me
at
last
in
a
sort
of
despair
but
i
lingered
with
a
last
hope
of
doing
something
and
drew
doubtfully
near
to
the
heart
of
the
wood
and
there
instead
of
the
silence
i
expected
i
heard
a
voice
it
seemed
as
if
the
squire
must
be
talking
to
himself
and
i
had
the
unpleasant
fancy
that
he
had
already
lost
his
reason
in
that
wood
of
witchcraft
but
i
soon
found
that
if
he
was
talking
he
was
talking
with
two
voices
other
fancies
attacked
me
as
that
the
other
was
the
voice
of
the
tree
or
the
voices
of
the
three
trees
talking
together
and
with
no
man
near
but
it
was
not
the
voice
of
the
tree
the
next
moment
i
knew
the
voice
for
i
had
heard
it
twenty
times
across
the
table
it
was
the
voice
of
that
doctor
of
yours
i
heard
it
as
certainly
as
you
hear
my
voice
after
a
moment
s
silence
he
resumed
i
left
the
wood
i
hardly
knew
why
and
with
wild
and
bewildered
feelings
and
as
i
came
out
into
the
faint
moonshine
i
saw
that
old
lawyer
standing
quietly
but
staring
at
me
like
an
owl
at
least
the
light
touched
his
red
hair
with
fire
but
his
square
old
face
was
in
shadow
but
i
knew
if
i
could
have
read
it
that
it
was
the
face
of
a
hanging
he
threw
himself
on
the
bench
again
smiled
a
little
and
added
only
like
a
good
many
hanging
judges
i
fancy
he
was
waiting
patiently
to
hang
the
wrong
and
the
right
man
said
paynter
mechanically
treherne
shrugged
his
shoulders
sprawling
on
the
ale
bench
and
played
with
his
empty
pot
iv
the
chase
after
the
truth
some
time
after
the
inquest
which
had
ended
in
the
inconclusive
verdict
which
andrew
ashe
had
himself
predicted
and
achieved
paynter
was
again
sitting
on
the
bench
outside
the
village
inn
having
on
the
little
table
in
front
of
it
a
tall
glass
of
light
ale
which
he
enjoyed
much
more
as
local
color
than
as
liquor
he
had
but
one
companion
on
the
bench
and
that
a
new
one
for
the
little
market
place
was
empty
at
that
hour
and
he
had
lately
for
the
rest
been
much
alone
he
was
not
unhappy
for
he
resembled
his
great
countryman
walt
whitman
in
carrying
a
kind
of
universe
with
him
like
an
open
umbrella
but
he
was
not
only
alone
but
lonely
for
ashe
had
gone
abruptly
up
to
london
and
since
his
return
had
been
occupied
obscurely
with
legal
matters
doubtless
bearing
on
the
murder
and
treherne
had
long
since
taken
up
his
position
openly
at
the
great
house
as
the
husband
of
the
great
lady
and
he
and
she
were
occupied
with
sweeping
reforms
on
the
estate
the
lady
especially
being
of
the
sort
whose
very
dreams
drive
at
practice
was
landscape
gardening
as
with
the
gestures
of
a
giantess
it
was
natural
therefore
that
so
sociable
a
spirit
as
paynter
should
fall
into
speech
with
the
one
other
stranger
who
happened
to
be
staying
at
the
inn
evidently
a
bird
of
passage
like
himself
this
man
who
was
smoking
a
pipe
on
the
bench
beside
him
with
his
knapsack
before
him
on
the
table
was
an
artist
come
to
sketch
on
that
romantic
coast
a
tall
man
in
a
velvet
jacket
with
a
shock
of
hair
a
long
fair
beard
but
eyes
of
dark
brown
the
effect
of
which
contrast
reminded
paynter
vaguely
he
hardly
knew
why
of
a
russian
the
stranger
carried
his
knapsack
into
many
picturesque
corners
he
obtained
permission
to
set
up
his
easel
in
that
high
garden
where
the
late
squire
had
held
his
al
fresco
banquets
but
paynter
had
never
had
an
opportunity
of
judging
of
the
artist
s
work
nor
did
he
find
it
easy
to
get
the
artist
even
to
talk
of
his
art
cyprian
himself
was
always
ready
to
talk
of
any
art
and
he
talked
of
it
excellently
but
with
little
response
he
gave
his
own
reasons
for
preferring
the
cubists
to
the
cult
of
picasso
but
his
new
friend
seemed
to
have
but
a
faint
interest
in
either
he
insinuated
that
perhaps
the
were
after
all
only
thinning
their
line
while
the
true
primitives
were
rather
tightening
it
but
the
stranger
seemed
to
receive
the
insinuation
without
any
marked
reaction
of
feeling
when
paynter
had
even
gone
back
as
far
into
the
past
as
the
to
find
a
common
ground
and
not
found
it
other
memories
began
to
creep
back
into
his
mind
he
was
just
reflecting
rather
darkly
that
after
all
the
tale
of
the
peacock
trees
needed
a
mysterious
stranger
to
round
it
off
and
this
man
had
much
the
air
of
being
one
when
the
mysterious
stranger
himself
said
suddenly
well
i
think
i
d
better
show
you
the
work
i
m
doing
down
he
had
his
knapsack
before
him
on
the
table
and
he
smiled
rather
grimly
as
he
began
to
unstrap
it
paynter
looked
on
with
polite
expressions
of
interest
but
was
considerably
surprised
when
the
artist
unpacked
and
placed
on
the
table
not
any
recognizable
works
of
art
even
of
the
most
cubist
description
but
first
a
quire
of
foolscap
closely
written
with
notes
in
black
and
red
ink
and
second
to
the
american
s
extreme
amazement
the
old
woodman
s
ax
with
the
linen
wrapper
which
he
had
himself
found
in
the
well
long
ago
sorry
to
give
you
a
start
sir
said
the
russian
artist
with
a
marked
london
accent
but
i
d
better
explain
straight
off
that
i
m
a
you
don
t
look
it
said
paynter
i
m
not
supposed
to
replied
the
other
mr
ashe
brought
me
down
here
from
the
yard
to
investigate
but
he
told
me
to
report
to
you
when
i
d
got
anything
to
go
on
would
you
like
to
go
into
the
matter
now
when
i
took
this
matter
up
explained
the
detective
i
did
it
at
ashe
s
request
and
largely
of
course
on
ashe
s
lines
ashe
is
a
great
criminal
lawyer
with
a
beautiful
brain
sir
as
full
as
the
newgate
calendar
i
took
as
a
working
notion
his
view
that
only
you
five
gentlemen
round
the
table
in
the
squire
s
garden
were
acquainted
with
the
squire
s
movements
but
you
gentlemen
if
i
may
say
so
have
a
way
of
forgetting
certain
other
things
and
other
people
which
we
are
rather
taught
to
look
for
first
and
as
i
followed
ashe
s
inquiries
through
the
stages
you
know
already
through
certain
suspicions
i
needn
t
discuss
because
they
ve
been
dropped
i
found
the
thing
shaping
after
all
toward
something
in
the
end
which
i
think
we
should
have
considered
at
the
beginning
now
to
begin
with
it
is
not
true
that
there
were
five
men
round
the
table
there
were
the
creepy
conditions
of
that
garden
vigil
vaguely
returned
upon
paynter
and
he
thought
of
a
ghost
or
something
more
nameless
than
a
ghost
but
the
deliberate
speech
of
the
detective
soon
enlightened
him
there
were
six
men
and
five
gentlemen
if
you
like
to
put
it
so
he
proceeded
that
man
miles
the
butler
saw
the
squire
vanish
as
plainly
as
you
did
and
i
soon
found
that
miles
was
a
man
worthy
of
a
good
deal
of
a
light
of
understanding
dawned
on
paynter
s
face
so
that
was
it
was
it
he
muttered
does
all
our
mythological
mystery
end
with
a
policeman
collaring
a
butler
well
i
agree
with
you
he
is
far
from
an
ordinary
butler
even
to
look
at
and
the
fault
in
imagination
is
mine
like
many
faults
in
imagination
it
was
simply
we
don
t
go
quite
so
fast
as
that
observed
the
officer
in
an
impassive
manner
i
only
said
i
found
the
inquiry
pointing
to
miles
and
that
he
was
well
worthy
of
attention
he
was
much
more
in
the
old
squire
s
confidence
than
many
people
supposed
and
when
i
him
he
told
me
a
good
deal
that
was
worth
knowing
i
ve
got
it
all
down
in
these
notes
here
but
at
the
moment
i
ll
only
trouble
you
with
one
detail
of
it
one
night
this
butler
was
just
outside
the
squire
s
door
when
he
heard
the
noise
of
a
violent
quarrel
the
squire
was
a
violent
gentleman
from
time
to
time
but
the
curious
thing
about
this
scene
was
that
the
other
gentleman
was
the
more
violent
of
the
two
miles
heard
him
say
repeatedly
that
the
squire
was
a
public
nuisance
and
that
his
death
would
be
a
good
riddance
for
everybody
i
only
stop
now
to
tell
you
that
the
other
gentleman
was
burton
brown
the
medical
man
of
this
village
the
next
examination
i
made
was
that
of
martin
the
woodcutter
upon
one
point
at
least
his
evidence
is
quite
clear
and
is
as
you
will
see
largely
confirmed
by
other
witnesses
he
says
first
that
the
doctor
prevented
him
from
recovering
his
ax
and
this
is
corroborated
by
and
treherne
but
he
says
further
that
the
doctor
admitted
having
the
thing
himself
and
this
again
finds
support
in
other
evidence
by
the
gardener
who
saw
the
doctor
some
time
afterward
come
by
himself
and
pick
up
the
chopper
martin
says
that
doctor
brown
repeatedly
refused
to
give
it
up
alleging
some
fanciful
excuse
every
time
and
finally
paynter
we
will
hear
the
evidence
of
the
ax
he
laid
the
woodman
s
tool
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
and
began
to
rip
up
and
unwrap
the
curious
linen
covering
round
the
handle
you
will
admit
this
is
an
odd
bandage
he
said
and
that
s
just
the
odd
thing
about
it
that
it
really
is
a
bandage
this
white
stuff
is
the
sort
of
lint
they
use
in
hospitals
cut
into
strips
like
this
but
most
doctors
keep
some
and
i
have
the
evidence
of
jake
the
fisherman
with
whom
doctor
brown
lived
for
some
time
that
the
doctor
had
this
useful
habit
and
last
he
added
flattening
out
a
corner
of
the
rag
on
the
table
isn
t
it
odd
that
it
should
be
marked
the
american
gazed
at
the
rudely
inked
initials
but
hardly
saw
them
what
he
saw
as
in
a
mirror
in
his
darkened
memory
was
the
black
figure
with
the
black
gloves
against
the
sunset
as
he
had
seen
it
when
he
came
out
of
the
wood
and
which
had
always
haunted
him
he
knew
not
why
of
course
i
see
what
you
mean
he
said
and
it
s
very
painful
for
me
for
i
knew
and
respected
the
man
but
surely
also
it
s
very
far
from
explaining
everything
if
he
is
a
murderer
is
he
a
magician
why
did
the
well
water
all
evaporate
in
a
night
and
leave
the
dead
man
s
bones
dry
as
dust
that
s
not
a
common
operation
in
the
hospitals
is
it
as
to
the
water
we
do
know
the
explanation
said
the
detective
i
didn
t
tumble
to
it
at
first
myself
being
a
cockney
but
a
little
talk
with
jake
and
the
other
fisherman
about
the
old
smuggling
days
put
me
straight
about
that
but
i
admit
the
dried
remains
still
stump
us
all
all
the
same
a
shadow
fell
across
the
table
and
his
talk
was
sharply
cut
short
ashe
was
standing
under
the
painted
sign
buttoned
up
grimly
in
black
and
with
the
face
of
the
hanging
judge
of
which
the
poet
had
spoken
plain
this
time
in
the
broad
sunlight
behind
him
stood
two
big
men
in
plain
clothes
very
still
but
paynter
knew
instantly
who
they
were
we
must
move
at
once
said
the
lawyer
dr
burton
brown
is
leaving
the
the
tall
detective
sprang
to
his
feet
and
paynter
instinctively
imitated
him
he
has
gone
up
to
the
trehernes
possibly
to
say
went
on
ashe
rapidly
i
m
sorry
but
we
must
arrest
him
in
the
garden
there
if
necessary
i
ve
kept
the
lady
out
of
the
way
i
think
but
you
addressing
the
factitious
landscape
painter
must
go
up
at
once
and
rig
up
that
easel
of
yours
near
the
table
and
be
ready
we
will
follow
quietly
and
come
up
behind
the
tree
we
must
be
careful
for
it
s
clear
he
s
got
wind
of
us
or
he
wouldn
t
be
doing
a
i
don
t
like
this
job
remarked
paynter
as
they
mounted
toward
the
park
and
garden
the
detective
darting
on
ahead
do
you
suppose
i
do
asked
ashe
and
indeed
his
strong
heavy
face
looked
so
lined
and
old
that
the
red
hair
seemed
unnatural
like
a
red
wig
i
ve
known
him
longer
than
you
though
perhaps
i
ve
suspected
him
longer
as
when
they
topped
the
slope
of
the
garden
the
detective
had
already
erected
his
easel
though
a
strong
breeze
blowing
toward
the
sea
rattled
and
flapped
his
apparatus
and
blew
about
his
fair
and
false
beard
in
the
wind
little
clouds
curled
like
feathers
were
scudding
seaward
across
the
landscape
which
the
american
art
critic
had
once
surveyed
on
a
happier
morning
but
it
is
doubtful
if
the
landscape
painter
paid
much
attention
to
it
treherne
was
dimly
discernible
in
the
doorway
of
what
was
now
his
house
he
would
come
no
nearer
for
he
hated
such
a
public
duty
more
bitterly
than
the
rest
the
others
posted
themselves
a
little
way
behind
the
tree
between
the
lines
of
these
masked
batteries
the
black
figure
of
the
doctor
could
be
seen
coming
across
the
green
lawn
traveling
straight
as
a
bullet
as
he
had
done
when
he
brought
the
bad
news
to
the
woodcutter
he
was
smiling
under
the
dark
mustache
that
was
cut
short
of
the
upper
lip
though
they
fancied
him
a
little
pale
and
he
seemed
to
pause
a
moment
and
peer
through
his
spectacles
at
the
artist
the
artist
turned
from
his
easel
with
a
natural
movement
and
then
in
a
flash
had
captured
the
doctor
by
the
coat
collar
i
arrest
you
he
began
but
doctor
brown
plucked
himself
free
with
startling
promptitude
took
a
flying
leap
at
the
other
tore
off
his
sham
beard
tossing
it
into
the
air
like
one
of
the
wild
wisps
of
the
cloud
then
with
one
wild
kick
sent
the
easel
flying
and
fled
like
a
hare
for
the
shore
even
at
that
dazzling
instant
paynter
felt
that
this
wild
reception
was
a
novelty
and
almost
an
anticlimax
but
he
had
no
time
for
analysis
when
he
and
the
whole
pack
had
to
follow
in
the
hunt
even
treherne
bringing
up
the
rear
with
a
renewed
curiosity
and
energy
the
fugitive
collided
with
one
of
the
policemen
who
ran
to
head
him
off
sending
him
sprawling
down
the
slope
indeed
the
fugitive
seemed
inspired
with
the
strength
of
a
wild
ape
he
cleared
at
a
bound
the
rampart
of
flowers
over
which
barbara
had
once
leaned
to
look
at
her
future
lover
and
tumbled
with
blinding
speed
down
the
steep
path
up
which
that
troubadour
had
climbed
racing
with
the
rushing
wind
they
all
streamed
across
the
garden
after
him
down
the
path
and
finally
on
to
the
seashore
by
the
fisher
s
cot
and
the
pierced
crags
and
caverns
the
american
had
admired
when
he
first
landed
the
runaway
did
not
however
make
for
the
house
he
had
long
inhabited
but
rather
for
the
pier
as
if
with
a
mind
to
seize
the
boat
or
to
swim
only
when
he
reached
the
other
end
of
the
small
stone
jetty
did
he
turn
and
show
them
the
pale
face
with
the
spectacles
and
they
saw
that
it
was
still
smiling
i
m
rather
glad
of
this
said
treherne
with
a
great
sigh
the
man
is
nevertheless
the
naturalness
of
the
doctor
s
voice
when
he
spoke
startled
them
as
much
as
a
shriek
gentleman
he
said
i
won
t
protract
your
painful
duties
by
asking
you
what
you
want
but
i
will
ask
at
once
for
a
small
favor
which
will
not
prejudice
those
duties
in
any
way
i
came
down
here
rather
in
a
hurry
perhaps
but
the
truth
is
i
thought
i
was
late
for
an
he
looked
dispassionately
at
his
watch
i
find
there
is
still
some
fifteen
minutes
will
you
wait
with
me
here
for
that
short
time
after
which
i
am
quite
at
your
there
was
a
bewildered
silence
and
then
paynter
said
for
my
part
i
feel
as
if
it
would
really
be
better
to
humor
ashe
said
the
doctor
with
a
new
note
of
seriousness
for
old
friendship
grant
me
this
last
little
indulgence
it
will
make
no
difference
i
have
no
arms
or
means
of
escape
you
can
search
me
if
you
like
i
know
you
think
you
are
doing
right
and
i
also
know
you
will
do
it
as
fairly
as
you
can
well
after
all
you
get
friends
to
help
you
look
at
our
friend
with
the
beard
or
the
remains
of
the
beard
why
shouldn
t
i
have
a
friend
to
help
me
a
man
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
in
whom
i
put
some
confidence
a
great
authority
on
these
things
why
not
if
only
out
of
curiosity
wait
and
hear
his
view
of
the
case
this
seems
all
moonshine
said
ashe
but
on
the
chance
of
any
light
on
things
well
from
the
moon
i
don
t
mind
waiting
a
quarter
of
an
hour
who
is
this
friend
i
wonder
some
amateur
detective
i
i
thank
you
said
the
doctor
with
some
dignity
i
think
you
will
trust
him
when
you
have
talked
to
him
a
little
and
now
he
added
with
an
air
of
amiably
relaxing
into
lighter
matters
let
us
talk
about
the
murder
this
case
he
said
in
a
detached
manner
will
be
found
i
suspect
to
be
rather
unique
there
is
a
very
clear
and
conclusive
combination
of
evidence
against
thomas
burton
brown
otherwise
myself
but
there
is
one
peculiarity
about
that
evidence
which
you
may
perhaps
have
noticed
it
all
comes
ultimately
from
one
source
and
that
a
rather
unusual
one
thus
the
woodcutter
says
i
had
his
ax
but
what
makes
him
think
so
he
says
i
told
him
i
had
his
ax
that
i
told
him
so
again
and
again
once
more
paynter
here
pulled
up
the
ax
out
of
the
well
but
how
i
think
paynter
will
testify
that
i
brought
him
the
tackle
for
fishing
it
up
tackle
he
might
never
have
got
in
any
other
way
curious
is
it
not
again
the
ax
is
found
to
be
wrapped
in
lint
that
was
in
my
possession
according
to
the
fisherman
but
who
showed
the
lint
to
the
fisherman
i
did
who
marked
it
with
large
letters
as
mine
i
did
who
wrapped
it
round
the
handle
at
all
i
did
rather
a
singular
thing
to
do
has
anyone
ever
explained
it
his
words
which
had
been
heard
at
first
with
painful
coldness
were
beginning
to
hold
more
and
more
of
their
attention
then
there
is
the
well
itself
proceeded
the
doctor
with
the
same
air
of
insane
calm
i
suppose
some
of
you
by
this
time
know
at
least
the
secret
of
that
the
secret
of
the
well
is
simply
that
it
is
not
a
well
it
is
purposely
shaped
at
the
top
so
as
to
look
like
one
but
it
is
really
a
sort
of
chimney
opening
from
the
roof
of
one
of
those
caves
over
there
a
cave
that
runs
inland
just
under
the
wood
and
indeed
is
connected
by
tunnels
and
secret
passages
with
other
openings
miles
and
miles
away
it
is
a
sort
of
labyrinth
used
by
smugglers
and
such
people
for
ages
past
this
doubtless
explains
many
of
those
disappearances
we
have
heard
of
but
to
return
to
the
well
that
is
not
a
well
in
case
some
of
you
still
don
t
know
about
it
when
the
sea
rises
very
high
at
certain
seasons
it
fills
the
low
cave
and
even
rises
a
little
way
in
the
funnel
above
making
it
look
more
like
a
well
than
ever
the
noise
paynter
heard
was
the
natural
eddy
of
a
breaker
from
outside
and
the
whole
experience
depended
on
something
so
elementary
as
the
the
american
was
startled
into
ordinary
speech
the
tide
he
said
and
i
never
even
thought
of
it
i
guess
that
comes
of
living
by
the
the
next
step
will
be
obvious
enough
continued
the
speaker
to
a
logical
mind
like
that
of
ashe
for
instance
if
it
be
asked
why
even
so
the
tide
did
not
wash
away
the
squire
s
remains
that
had
lain
there
since
his
disappearance
there
is
only
one
possible
answer
the
remains
had
not
lain
there
since
his
disappearance
the
remains
had
been
deliberately
put
there
in
the
cavern
under
the
wood
and
put
there
after
paynter
had
made
his
first
investigation
they
were
put
there
in
short
after
the
sea
had
retreated
and
the
cave
was
again
dry
that
is
why
they
were
dry
of
course
much
drier
than
the
cave
who
put
them
there
i
wonder
he
was
gazing
gravely
through
his
spectacles
over
their
heads
into
vacancy
and
suddenly
he
smiled
ah
he
cried
jumping
up
from
the
rock
with
alacrity
here
is
the
amateur
detective
at
last
ashe
turned
his
head
over
his
shoulder
and
for
a
few
seconds
did
not
move
it
again
but
stood
as
if
with
a
stiff
neck
in
the
cliff
just
behind
him
was
one
of
the
clefts
or
cracks
into
which
it
was
everywhere
cloven
advancing
from
this
into
the
sunshine
as
if
from
a
narrow
door
was
squire
vane
with
a
broad
smile
on
his
face
the
wind
was
tearing
from
the
top
of
the
high
cliff
out
to
sea
passing
over
their
heads
and
they
had
the
sensation
that
everything
was
passing
over
their
heads
and
out
of
their
control
paynter
felt
as
if
his
head
had
been
blown
off
like
a
hat
but
none
of
this
gale
of
unreason
seemed
to
stir
a
hair
on
the
white
head
of
the
squire
whose
bearing
though
and
bordering
on
a
swagger
seemed
if
anything
more
comfortable
than
in
the
old
days
his
red
face
was
however
burnt
like
a
sailor
s
and
his
light
clothes
had
a
foreign
look
well
gentlemen
he
said
genially
so
this
is
the
end
of
the
legend
of
the
peacock
trees
sorry
to
spoil
that
delightful
traveler
s
tale
paynter
but
the
joke
couldn
t
be
kept
up
forever
sorry
to
put
a
stop
to
your
best
poem
treherne
but
i
thought
all
this
poetry
had
been
going
a
little
too
far
so
doctor
brown
and
i
fixed
up
a
little
surprise
for
you
and
i
must
say
without
vanity
that
you
look
a
little
what
on
earth
asked
ashe
at
last
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
the
squire
laughed
pleasantly
and
even
a
little
apologetically
i
m
afraid
i
m
fond
of
practical
jokes
he
said
and
this
i
suppose
is
my
last
grand
practical
joke
but
i
want
you
to
understand
that
the
joke
is
really
practical
i
flatter
myself
it
will
be
of
very
practical
use
to
the
cause
of
progress
and
common
sense
and
the
killing
of
such
superstitions
everywhere
the
best
part
of
it
i
admit
was
the
doctor
s
idea
and
not
mine
all
i
meant
to
do
was
to
pass
a
night
in
the
trees
and
then
turn
up
as
fresh
as
paint
to
tell
you
what
fools
you
were
but
doctor
brown
here
followed
me
into
the
wood
and
we
had
a
little
talk
which
rather
changed
my
plans
he
told
me
that
a
disappearance
for
a
few
hours
like
that
would
never
knock
the
nonsense
on
the
head
most
people
would
never
even
hear
of
it
and
those
who
did
would
say
that
one
night
proved
nothing
he
showed
me
a
much
better
way
which
had
been
tried
in
several
cases
where
bogus
miracles
had
been
shown
up
the
thing
to
do
was
to
get
the
thing
really
believed
everywhere
as
a
miracle
and
then
shown
up
everywhere
as
a
sham
miracle
i
can
t
put
all
the
arguments
as
well
as
he
did
but
that
was
the
notion
i
the
doctor
nodded
gazing
silently
at
the
sand
and
the
squire
resumed
with
undiminished
relish
we
agreed
that
i
should
drop
through
the
hole
into
the
cave
and
make
my
way
through
the
tunnels
where
i
often
used
to
play
as
a
boy
to
the
railway
station
a
few
miles
from
here
and
there
take
a
train
for
london
it
was
necessary
for
the
joke
of
course
that
i
should
disappear
without
being
traced
so
i
made
my
way
to
a
port
and
put
in
a
very
pleasant
month
or
two
round
my
old
haunts
in
cyprus
and
the
mediterranean
there
s
no
more
to
say
of
that
part
of
the
business
except
that
i
arranged
to
be
back
by
a
particular
time
and
here
i
am
but
i
ve
heard
enough
of
what
s
gone
on
round
here
to
be
satisfied
that
i
ve
done
the
trick
everybody
in
cornwall
and
most
people
in
south
england
have
heard
of
the
vanishing
squire
and
thousands
of
noodles
have
been
nodding
their
heads
over
crystals
and
tarot
cards
at
this
marvelous
proof
of
an
unseen
world
i
reckon
the
reappearing
squire
will
scatter
their
cards
and
smash
their
crystals
so
that
such
rubbish
won
t
appear
again
in
the
twentieth
century
i
ll
make
the
peacock
trees
the
laughing
stock
of
all
europe
and
well
said
the
lawyer
who
was
the
first
to
rearrange
his
wits
i
m
sure
we
re
all
only
too
delighted
to
see
you
again
squire
and
i
quite
understand
your
explanation
and
your
own
very
natural
motives
in
the
matter
but
i
m
afraid
i
haven
t
got
the
hang
of
everything
yet
granted
that
you
wanted
to
vanish
was
it
necessary
to
put
bogus
bones
in
the
cave
so
as
nearly
to
put
a
halter
round
the
neck
of
doctor
brown
and
who
put
it
there
the
statement
would
appear
perfectly
maniacal
but
so
far
as
i
can
make
head
or
tail
out
of
anything
doctor
brown
seems
to
have
put
it
there
the
doctor
lifted
his
head
for
the
first
time
yes
i
put
the
bones
there
he
said
i
believe
i
am
the
first
son
of
adam
who
ever
manufactured
all
the
evidence
of
a
murder
charge
against
it
was
the
squire
s
turn
to
look
astonished
the
old
gentleman
looked
rather
wildly
from
one
to
the
other
bones
murder
charge
he
ejaculated
what
the
devil
is
all
this
whose
bones
your
bones
in
a
manner
of
speaking
delicately
conceded
the
doctor
i
had
to
make
sure
you
had
really
died
and
not
disappeared
by
the
squire
in
his
turn
seemed
more
hopelessly
puzzled
than
the
whole
crowd
of
his
friends
had
been
over
his
own
escapade
why
not
he
demanded
i
thought
it
was
the
whole
point
to
make
it
look
like
magic
why
did
you
want
me
to
die
so
much
doctor
brown
had
lifted
his
head
and
he
now
very
slowly
lifted
his
hand
he
pointed
with
outstretched
arm
at
the
headland
overhanging
the
foreshore
just
above
the
entrance
to
the
cave
it
was
the
exact
part
of
the
beach
where
paynter
had
first
landed
on
that
spring
morning
when
he
had
looked
up
in
his
first
fresh
wonder
at
the
peacock
trees
but
the
trees
were
gone
the
fact
itself
was
no
surprise
to
them
the
clearance
had
naturally
been
one
of
the
first
of
the
sweeping
changes
of
the
treherne
regime
but
though
they
knew
it
well
they
had
wholly
forgotten
it
and
its
significance
returned
on
them
suddenly
like
a
sign
in
heaven
that
is
the
reason
said
the
doctor
i
have
worked
for
that
for
fourteen
they
no
longer
looked
at
the
bare
promontory
on
which
the
feathery
trees
had
once
been
so
familiar
a
sight
for
they
had
something
else
to
look
at
anyone
seeing
the
squire
now
would
have
shifted
his
opinion
about
where
to
find
the
lunatic
in
that
crowd
it
was
plain
in
a
flash
that
the
change
had
fallen
on
him
like
a
thunderbolt
that
he
at
least
had
never
had
the
wildest
notion
that
the
tale
of
the
vanishing
squire
had
been
but
a
prelude
to
that
of
the
vanishing
trees
the
next
half
hour
was
full
of
his
ravings
and
expostulations
which
gradually
died
away
into
demands
for
explanation
and
incoherent
questions
repeated
again
and
again
he
had
practically
to
be
overruled
at
last
in
spite
of
the
respect
in
which
he
was
held
before
anything
like
a
space
and
silence
were
made
in
which
the
doctor
could
tell
his
own
story
it
was
perhaps
a
singular
story
of
which
he
alone
had
ever
had
the
knowledge
and
though
its
narration
was
not
uninterrupted
it
may
be
set
forth
consecutively
in
his
own
words
first
i
wish
it
clearly
understood
that
i
believe
in
nothing
i
do
not
even
give
the
nothing
i
believe
a
name
or
i
should
be
an
atheist
i
have
never
had
inside
my
head
so
much
as
a
hint
of
heaven
and
hell
i
think
it
most
likely
we
are
worms
in
the
mud
but
i
happen
to
be
sorry
for
the
other
worms
under
the
wheel
and
i
happen
myself
to
be
a
sort
of
worm
that
turns
when
he
can
if
i
care
nothing
for
piety
i
care
less
for
poetry
i
m
not
like
ashe
here
who
is
crammed
with
criminology
but
has
all
sorts
of
other
culture
as
well
i
know
nothing
about
culture
except
bacteria
culture
i
sometimes
fancy
ashe
is
as
much
an
art
critic
as
paynter
only
he
looks
for
his
heroes
or
villains
in
real
life
but
i
am
a
very
practical
man
and
my
stepping
stones
have
been
simply
scientific
facts
in
this
village
i
found
a
fact
a
fever
i
could
not
classify
it
it
seemed
peculiar
to
this
corner
of
the
coast
it
had
singular
reactions
of
delirium
and
mental
breakdown
i
studied
it
exactly
as
i
should
a
queer
case
in
the
hospital
and
corresponded
and
compared
notes
with
other
men
of
science
but
nobody
had
even
a
working
hypothesis
about
it
except
of
course
the
ignorant
peasantry
who
said
the
peacock
trees
were
in
some
wild
way
poisonous
well
the
peacock
trees
were
poisonous
the
peacock
trees
did
produce
the
fever
i
verified
the
fact
in
the
plain
plodding
way
required
comparing
all
the
degrees
and
details
of
a
vast
number
of
cases
and
there
were
a
shocking
number
to
compare
at
the
end
of
it
i
had
discovered
the
thing
as
harvey
discovered
the
circulation
of
the
blood
everybody
was
the
worse
for
being
near
the
things
those
who
came
off
best
were
exactly
the
exceptions
that
proved
the
rule
abnormally
healthy
and
energetic
people
like
the
squire
and
his
daughter
in
other
words
the
peasants
were
right
but
if
i
put
it
that
way
somebody
will
cry
but
do
you
believe
it
was
supernatural
then
in
fact
that
s
what
you
ll
all
say
and
that
s
exactly
what
i
complain
of
i
fancy
hundreds
of
men
have
been
left
dead
and
diseases
left
undiscovered
by
this
suspicion
of
superstition
this
stupid
fear
of
fear
unless
you
see
daylight
through
the
forest
of
facts
from
the
first
you
won
t
venture
into
the
wood
at
all
unless
we
can
promise
you
beforehand
that
there
shall
be
what
you
call
a
natural
explanation
to
save
your
precious
dignity
from
miracles
you
won
t
even
hear
the
beginning
of
the
plain
tale
suppose
there
isn
t
a
natural
explanation
suppose
there
is
and
we
never
find
it
suppose
i
haven
t
a
notion
whether
there
is
or
not
what
the
devil
has
that
to
do
with
you
or
with
me
in
dealing
with
the
facts
i
do
know
my
own
instinct
is
to
think
there
is
that
if
my
researches
could
be
followed
far
enough
it
would
be
found
that
some
horrible
parody
of
hay
fever
some
effect
analogous
to
that
of
pollen
would
explain
all
the
facts
i
have
never
found
the
explanation
what
i
have
found
are
the
facts
and
the
fact
is
that
those
trees
on
the
top
there
dealt
death
right
and
left
as
certainly
as
if
they
had
been
giants
standing
on
a
hill
and
knocking
men
down
in
crowds
with
a
club
it
will
be
said
that
now
i
had
only
to
produce
my
proofs
and
have
the
nuisance
removed
perhaps
i
might
have
convinced
the
scientific
world
finally
when
more
and
more
processions
of
dead
men
had
passed
through
the
village
to
the
cemetery
but
i
had
not
got
to
convince
the
scientific
world
but
the
lord
of
the
manor
the
squire
will
pardon
my
saying
that
it
was
a
very
different
thing
i
tried
it
once
i
lost
my
temper
and
said
things
i
do
not
defend
and
i
left
the
squire
s
prejudices
rooted
anew
like
the
trees
i
was
confronted
with
one
colossal
coincidence
that
was
an
obstacle
to
all
my
aims
one
thing
made
all
my
science
sound
like
nonsense
it
was
the
popular
legend
squire
if
there
were
a
legend
of
hay
fever
you
would
not
believe
in
hay
fever
if
there
were
a
popular
story
about
pollen
you
would
say
that
pollen
was
only
a
popular
story
i
had
something
against
me
heavier
and
more
hopeless
than
the
hostility
of
the
learned
i
had
the
support
of
the
ignorant
my
truth
was
hopelessly
tangled
up
with
a
tale
that
the
educated
were
resolved
to
regard
as
entirely
a
lie
i
never
tried
to
explain
again
on
the
contrary
i
apologized
affected
a
conversion
to
the
view
and
watched
events
and
all
the
time
the
lines
of
a
larger
if
more
crooked
plan
began
to
get
clearer
in
my
mind
i
knew
that
miss
vane
whether
or
no
she
were
married
to
treherne
as
i
afterward
found
she
was
was
so
much
under
his
influence
that
the
first
day
of
her
inheritance
would
be
the
last
day
of
the
poisonous
trees
but
she
could
not
inherit
or
even
interfere
till
the
squire
died
it
became
simply
to
a
rational
mind
that
the
squire
must
die
but
wishing
to
be
humane
as
well
as
rational
i
desired
his
death
to
be
temporary
doubtless
my
scheme
was
completed
by
a
chapter
of
accidents
but
i
was
watching
for
such
accidents
thus
i
had
a
foreshadowing
of
how
the
ax
would
figure
in
the
tale
when
it
was
first
flung
at
the
trees
it
would
have
surprised
the
woodman
to
know
how
near
our
minds
were
and
how
i
was
but
laying
a
more
elaborate
siege
to
the
towers
of
pestilence
but
when
the
squire
spontaneously
rushed
on
what
half
the
countryside
would
call
certain
death
i
jumped
at
my
chance
i
followed
him
and
told
him
all
that
he
has
told
you
i
don
t
suppose
he
ll
ever
forgive
me
now
but
that
shan
t
prevent
me
saying
that
i
admire
him
hugely
for
being
what
people
would
call
a
lunatic
and
what
is
really
a
sportsman
it
takes
rather
a
grand
old
man
to
make
a
joke
in
the
grand
style
he
came
down
so
quick
from
the
tree
he
had
climbed
that
he
had
no
time
to
pull
his
hat
off
the
bough
it
had
caught
in
at
first
i
found
i
had
made
a
miscalculation
i
thought
his
disappearance
would
be
taken
as
his
death
at
least
after
a
little
time
but
ashe
told
me
there
could
be
no
formalities
without
a
corpse
i
fear
i
was
a
little
annoyed
but
i
soon
set
myself
to
the
duty
of
manufacturing
a
corpse
it
s
not
hard
for
a
doctor
to
get
a
skeleton
indeed
i
had
one
but
paynter
s
energy
was
a
day
too
early
for
me
and
i
only
got
the
bones
into
the
well
when
he
had
already
found
it
his
story
gave
me
another
chance
however
i
noted
where
the
hole
was
in
the
hat
and
made
a
precisely
corresponding
hole
in
the
skull
the
reason
for
creating
the
other
clews
may
not
be
so
obvious
it
may
not
yet
be
altogether
apparent
to
you
that
i
am
not
a
fiend
in
human
form
i
could
not
substantiate
a
murder
without
at
least
suggesting
a
murderer
and
i
was
resolved
that
if
the
crime
happened
to
be
traced
to
anybody
it
should
be
to
me
so
i
m
not
surprised
you
were
puzzled
about
the
purpose
of
the
rag
round
the
ax
because
it
had
no
purpose
except
to
incriminate
the
man
who
put
it
there
the
chase
had
to
end
with
me
and
when
it
was
closing
in
at
last
the
joke
of
it
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
fear
i
took
liberties
with
the
gentleman
s
easel
and
beard
i
was
the
only
person
who
could
risk
it
being
the
only
person
who
could
at
the
last
moment
produce
the
squire
and
prove
there
had
been
no
crime
at
all
that
gentlemen
is
the
true
story
of
the
peacock
trees
and
that
bare
crag
up
there
where
the
wind
is
whistling
as
it
would
over
a
wilderness
is
a
waste
place
i
have
labored
to
make
as
many
men
have
labored
to
make
a
cathedral
i
don
t
think
there
is
any
more
to
say
and
yet
something
moves
in
my
blood
and
i
will
try
to
say
it
could
you
not
have
trusted
a
little
these
peasants
whom
you
already
trust
so
much
these
men
are
men
and
they
meant
something
even
their
fathers
were
not
wholly
fools
if
your
gardener
told
you
of
the
trees
you
called
him
a
madman
but
he
did
not
plan
and
plant
your
garden
like
a
madman
you
would
not
trust
your
woodman
about
these
trees
yet
you
trusted
him
with
all
the
others
have
you
ever
thought
what
all
the
work
of
the
world
would
be
like
if
the
poor
were
so
senseless
as
you
think
them
but
no
you
stuck
to
your
rational
principle
and
your
rational
principle
was
that
a
thing
must
be
false
because
thousands
of
men
had
found
it
true
that
because
many
human
eyes
had
seen
something
it
could
not
be
he
looked
across
at
ashe
with
a
sort
of
challenge
but
though
the
sea
wind
ruffled
the
old
lawyer
s
red
mane
his
napoleonic
mask
was
unruffled
it
even
had
a
sort
of
beauty
from
its
new
benignity
i
am
too
happy
just
now
in
thinking
how
wrong
i
have
been
he
answered
to
quarrel
with
you
doctor
about
our
theories
and
yet
in
justice
to
the
squire
as
well
as
myself
i
should
demur
to
your
sweeping
inference
i
respect
these
peasants
i
respect
your
regard
for
them
but
their
stories
are
a
different
matter
i
think
i
would
do
anything
for
them
but
believe
them
truth
and
fancy
after
all
are
mixed
in
them
when
in
the
more
instructed
they
are
separate
and
i
doubt
if
you
have
considered
what
would
be
involved
in
taking
their
word
for
anything
half
the
ghosts
of
those
who
died
of
fever
may
be
walking
by
now
and
kind
as
these
people
are
i
believe
they
might
still
burn
a
witch
no
doctor
i
admit
these
people
have
been
badly
used
i
admit
they
are
in
many
ways
our
betters
but
i
still
could
not
accept
anything
in
their
the
doctor
bowed
gravely
and
respectfully
enough
and
then
for
the
last
time
that
day
they
saw
his
rather
sinister
smile
quite
so
he
said
but
you
would
have
hanged
me
on
their
and
turning
his
back
on
them
as
if
automatically
he
set
his
face
toward
the
village
where
for
so
many
years
he
had
gone
his
round
