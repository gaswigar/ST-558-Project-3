chapter
i
captain
rifle
gray
and
old
in
the
alaskan
steamship
service
had
not
lost
the
spirit
of
his
youth
along
with
his
years
romance
was
not
dead
in
him
and
the
fire
which
is
built
up
of
clean
adventure
and
the
association
of
strong
men
and
a
mighty
country
had
not
died
out
of
his
veins
he
could
still
see
the
picturesque
feel
the
thrill
of
the
unusual
and
at
times
warm
memories
crowded
upon
him
so
closely
that
yesterday
seemed
today
and
alaska
was
young
again
thrilling
the
world
with
her
wild
call
to
those
who
had
courage
to
come
and
fight
for
her
treasures
and
live
or
die
tonight
with
the
softly
musical
throb
of
his
ship
under
his
feet
and
the
yellow
moon
climbing
up
from
behind
the
ramparts
of
the
alaskan
mountains
something
of
loneliness
seized
upon
him
and
he
said
simply
that
is
alaska
the
girl
standing
beside
him
at
the
rail
did
not
turn
nor
for
a
moment
did
she
answer
he
could
see
her
profile
as
a
cameo
in
the
almost
vivid
light
and
in
that
light
her
eyes
were
wide
and
filled
with
a
dusky
fire
and
her
lips
were
parted
a
little
and
her
slim
body
was
tense
as
she
looked
at
the
wonder
of
the
moon
silhouetting
the
cragged
castles
of
the
peaks
up
where
the
soft
gray
clouds
lay
like
shimmering
draperies
then
she
turned
her
face
a
little
and
nodded
yes
alaska
she
said
and
the
old
captain
fancied
there
was
the
slightest
ripple
of
a
tremor
in
her
voice
your
alaska
captain
rifle
out
of
the
clearness
of
the
night
came
to
them
a
distant
sound
like
the
low
moan
of
thunder
twice
before
mary
standish
had
heard
it
and
now
she
asked
what
was
that
surely
it
can
not
be
a
storm
with
the
moon
like
that
and
the
stars
so
clear
above
it
is
ice
breaking
from
the
glaciers
and
falling
into
the
sea
we
are
in
the
wrangel
narrows
and
very
near
the
shore
miss
standish
if
it
were
day
you
could
hear
the
birds
singing
this
is
what
we
call
the
inside
passage
i
have
always
called
it
the
of
the
world
and
yet
if
you
will
observe
i
must
be
mistaken
for
we
are
almost
alone
on
this
side
of
the
ship
is
it
not
proof
if
i
were
right
the
men
and
women
in
there
dancing
playing
cards
chattering
would
be
crowding
this
rail
can
you
imagine
humans
like
that
but
they
ca
see
what
i
see
for
i
am
a
ridiculous
old
fool
who
remembers
things
ah
do
you
catch
that
in
the
air
miss
standish
the
perfume
of
flowers
of
forests
of
green
things
ashore
it
is
faint
but
i
catch
it
and
so
do
i
she
breathed
in
deeply
of
the
sweet
air
and
turned
then
so
that
she
stood
with
her
back
to
the
rail
facing
the
flaming
lights
of
the
ship
the
mellow
cadence
of
the
music
came
to
her
and
sleepy
she
could
hear
the
shuffle
of
dancing
feet
laughter
rippled
with
the
rhythmic
thrum
of
the
ship
voices
rose
and
fell
beyond
the
lighted
windows
and
as
the
old
captain
looked
at
her
there
was
something
in
her
face
which
he
could
not
understand
she
had
come
aboard
strangely
at
seattle
alone
and
almost
at
the
last
minute
defying
the
necessity
of
making
reservation
where
half
a
thousand
others
had
been
turned
away
and
chance
had
brought
her
under
his
eyes
in
desperation
she
had
appealed
to
him
and
he
had
discovered
a
strange
terror
under
the
forced
calm
of
her
appearance
since
then
he
had
fathered
her
with
his
attentions
watching
closely
with
the
wisdom
of
years
and
more
than
once
he
had
observed
that
questing
defiant
poise
of
her
head
with
which
she
was
regarding
the
cabin
windows
now
she
had
told
him
she
was
and
on
her
way
to
meet
relatives
in
nome
she
had
named
certain
people
and
he
had
believed
her
it
was
impossible
not
to
believe
her
and
he
admired
her
pluck
in
breaking
all
official
regulations
in
coming
aboard
in
many
ways
she
was
companionable
and
sweet
yet
out
of
his
experience
he
gathered
the
fact
that
she
was
under
a
tension
he
knew
that
in
some
way
she
was
making
a
fight
but
influenced
by
the
wisdom
of
three
and
sixty
years
he
did
not
let
her
know
he
had
guessed
the
truth
he
watched
her
closely
now
without
seeming
to
do
so
she
was
very
pretty
in
a
quiet
and
unusual
way
there
was
something
irresistibly
attractive
about
her
appealing
to
old
memories
which
were
painted
clearly
in
his
heart
she
was
girlishly
slim
he
had
observed
that
her
eyes
were
beautifully
clear
and
gray
in
the
sunlight
and
her
exquisitely
smooth
dark
hair
neatly
coiled
and
luxuriant
crown
of
beauty
reminded
him
of
puritanism
in
its
simplicity
at
times
he
doubted
that
she
was
if
she
had
said
nineteen
or
twenty
he
would
have
been
better
satisfied
she
puzzled
him
and
roused
speculation
in
him
but
it
was
a
part
of
his
business
to
see
many
things
which
others
might
not
see
and
hold
his
tongue
we
are
not
quite
alone
she
was
saying
there
are
others
and
she
made
a
little
gesture
toward
two
figures
farther
up
the
rail
old
donald
hardwick
of
skagway
he
said
and
the
other
is
alan
holt
oh
yes
she
was
facing
the
mountains
again
her
eyes
shining
in
the
light
of
the
moon
gently
her
hand
touched
the
old
captain
arm
listen
she
whispered
another
berg
breaking
away
from
old
thunder
we
are
very
near
the
shore
and
there
are
glaciers
all
the
way
up
and
that
other
sound
like
low
wind
on
a
night
so
still
and
calm
what
is
it
you
always
hear
that
when
very
close
to
the
big
mountains
miss
standish
it
is
made
by
the
water
of
a
thousand
streams
and
rivulets
rushing
down
to
the
sea
wherever
there
is
melting
snow
in
the
mountains
you
hear
that
song
and
this
man
alan
holt
she
reminded
him
he
is
a
part
of
these
things
possibly
more
than
any
other
man
miss
standish
he
was
born
in
alaska
before
nome
or
fairbanks
or
dawson
city
were
thought
of
it
was
in
i
think
let
me
see
that
would
make
him
she
said
so
quickly
that
for
a
moment
he
was
astonished
then
he
chuckled
you
are
very
good
at
figures
he
felt
an
almost
imperceptible
tightening
of
her
fingers
on
his
arm
this
evening
just
after
dinner
old
donald
found
me
sitting
alone
he
said
he
was
lonely
and
wanted
to
talk
with
someone
like
me
he
almost
frightened
me
with
his
great
gray
beard
and
shaggy
hair
i
thought
of
ghosts
as
we
talked
there
in
the
dusk
old
donald
belongs
to
the
days
when
the
chilkoot
and
the
white
horse
ate
up
men
lives
and
a
trail
of
living
dead
led
from
the
summit
to
klondike
miss
standish
said
captain
rifle
you
will
meet
many
like
him
in
alaska
and
they
remember
you
can
see
it
in
their
faces
always
the
memory
of
those
days
that
are
gone
she
bowed
her
head
a
little
looking
to
the
sea
and
alan
holt
you
know
him
well
few
men
know
him
well
he
is
a
part
of
alaska
itself
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
him
more
aloof
than
the
mountains
but
i
know
him
all
northern
alaska
knows
alan
holt
he
has
a
reindeer
range
up
beyond
the
endicott
mountains
and
is
always
seeking
the
last
frontier
he
must
be
very
brave
alaska
breeds
heroic
men
miss
standish
and
honorable
men
men
you
can
trust
and
believe
in
yes
it
is
odd
she
said
with
a
trembling
little
laugh
that
was
like
a
in
her
throat
i
have
never
seen
alaska
before
and
yet
something
about
these
mountains
makes
me
feel
that
i
have
known
them
a
long
time
ago
i
seem
to
feel
they
are
welcoming
me
and
that
i
am
going
home
alan
holt
is
a
fortunate
man
i
should
like
to
be
an
alaskan
and
you
are
an
american
she
finished
for
him
a
sudden
swift
irony
in
her
voice
a
poor
product
out
of
the
captain
rifle
i
am
going
north
to
learn
only
that
miss
standish
his
question
quietly
spoken
and
without
emphasis
demanded
an
answer
his
kindly
face
seamed
by
the
suns
and
winds
of
many
years
at
sea
was
filled
with
honest
anxiety
as
she
turned
to
look
straight
into
his
eyes
i
must
press
the
question
he
said
as
the
captain
of
this
ship
and
as
a
father
it
is
my
duty
is
there
not
something
you
would
like
to
tell
me
in
confidence
if
you
will
have
it
so
for
an
instant
she
hesitated
then
slowly
she
shook
her
head
there
is
nothing
captain
rifle
and
yet
you
came
aboard
very
strangely
he
urged
you
will
recall
that
it
was
most
unusual
without
reservation
without
baggage
you
forget
the
she
reminded
him
yes
but
one
does
not
start
for
northern
alaska
with
only
a
scarcely
large
enough
to
contain
a
change
of
linen
miss
standish
but
i
did
captain
rifle
true
and
i
saw
you
fighting
past
the
guards
like
a
little
wildcat
it
was
without
precedent
i
am
sorry
but
they
were
stupid
and
difficult
to
pass
only
by
chance
did
i
happen
to
see
it
all
my
child
otherwise
the
ship
regulations
would
have
compelled
me
to
send
you
ashore
you
were
frightened
you
can
not
deny
that
you
were
running
away
from
something
he
was
amazed
at
the
childish
simplicity
with
which
she
answered
him
yes
i
was
running
away
from
something
her
eyes
were
beautifully
clear
and
unafraid
and
yet
again
he
sensed
the
thrill
of
the
fight
she
was
making
and
you
will
not
tell
me
why
or
from
what
you
were
escaping
i
can
not
tonight
i
may
do
so
before
we
reach
nome
but
it
is
possible
what
that
i
shall
never
reach
nome
suddenly
she
caught
one
of
his
hands
in
both
her
own
her
fingers
clung
to
him
and
with
a
little
note
of
fierceness
in
her
voice
she
hugged
the
hand
to
her
breast
i
know
just
how
good
you
have
been
to
me
she
cried
i
should
like
to
tell
you
why
i
came
aboard
like
that
but
i
can
not
look
look
at
those
wonderful
mountains
with
one
free
hand
she
pointed
behind
them
and
beyond
them
lie
the
romance
and
adventure
and
mystery
of
centuries
and
for
nearly
thirty
years
you
have
been
very
near
those
things
captain
rifle
no
man
will
ever
see
again
what
you
have
seen
or
feel
what
you
have
felt
or
forget
what
you
have
had
to
forget
i
know
it
and
after
all
that
ca
you
wo
you
forget
the
strange
manner
in
which
i
came
aboard
this
ship
it
is
such
a
simple
little
thing
to
put
out
of
your
mind
so
trivial
so
unimportant
when
you
look
back
and
think
please
captain
rifle
please
so
quickly
that
he
scarcely
sensed
the
happening
of
it
she
pressed
his
hand
to
her
lips
their
warm
thrill
came
and
went
in
an
instant
leaving
him
speechless
his
resolution
gone
i
love
you
because
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
she
whispered
and
as
suddenly
as
she
had
kissed
his
hand
she
was
gone
leaving
him
alone
at
the
rail
chapter
ii
alan
holt
saw
the
slim
figure
of
the
girl
silhouetted
against
the
vivid
light
of
the
open
doorway
of
the
salon
he
was
not
watching
her
nor
did
he
look
closely
at
the
exceedingly
attractive
picture
which
she
made
as
she
paused
there
for
an
instant
after
leaving
captain
rifle
to
him
she
was
only
one
of
the
five
hundred
human
atoms
that
went
to
make
up
the
tremendously
interesting
life
of
one
of
the
first
ships
of
the
season
going
north
fate
through
the
suave
agency
of
the
purser
had
brought
him
into
a
bit
closer
proximity
to
her
than
the
others
that
was
all
for
two
days
her
seat
in
the
had
been
at
the
same
table
not
quite
opposite
him
as
she
had
missed
both
breakfast
hours
and
he
had
skipped
two
luncheons
the
requirements
of
neighborliness
and
of
courtesy
had
not
imposed
more
than
a
dozen
words
of
speech
upon
them
this
was
very
satisfactory
to
alan
he
was
not
talkative
or
communicative
of
his
own
free
will
there
was
a
certain
cynicism
back
of
his
love
of
silence
he
was
a
good
listener
and
a
analyst
some
people
he
knew
were
born
to
talk
and
others
to
trim
the
balance
were
burdened
with
the
necessity
of
holding
their
tongues
for
him
silence
was
not
a
burden
in
his
cool
and
causal
way
he
admired
mary
standish
she
was
very
quiet
and
he
liked
her
because
of
that
he
could
not
of
course
escape
the
beauty
of
her
eyes
or
the
shimmering
luster
of
the
long
lashes
that
darkened
them
but
these
were
details
which
did
not
thrill
him
but
merely
pleased
him
and
her
hair
pleased
him
possibly
even
more
than
her
gray
eyes
though
he
was
not
sufficiently
concerned
to
discuss
the
matter
with
himself
but
if
he
had
pointed
out
any
one
thing
it
would
have
been
her
hair
not
so
much
the
color
of
it
as
the
care
she
evidently
gave
it
and
the
manner
in
which
she
dressed
it
he
noted
that
it
was
dark
with
varying
flashes
of
luster
in
it
under
the
dinner
lights
but
what
he
approved
of
most
of
all
were
the
smooth
silky
coils
in
which
she
fastened
it
to
her
pretty
head
it
was
an
intense
relief
after
looking
on
so
many
frowsy
heads
bobbed
and
marcelled
during
his
six
months
visit
in
the
states
so
he
liked
her
generally
speaking
because
there
was
not
a
thing
about
her
that
he
might
dislike
he
did
not
of
course
wonder
what
the
girl
might
be
thinking
of
him
with
his
quiet
stern
face
his
cold
indifference
his
rather
litheness
and
the
single
patch
of
gray
that
streaked
his
thick
blond
hair
his
interest
had
not
reached
anywhere
near
that
point
tonight
it
was
probable
that
no
woman
in
the
world
could
have
interested
him
except
as
the
always
casual
observer
of
humanity
another
and
greater
thing
gripped
him
and
had
thrilled
him
since
he
first
felt
the
throbbing
pulse
of
the
engines
of
the
new
steamship
under
his
feet
at
seattle
he
was
going
and
home
meant
alaska
it
meant
the
mountains
the
vast
tundras
the
immeasurable
spaces
into
which
civilization
had
not
yet
come
with
its
clang
and
clamor
it
meant
friends
the
stars
he
knew
his
herds
everything
he
loved
such
was
his
reaction
after
six
months
of
exile
six
months
of
loneliness
and
desolation
in
cities
which
he
had
learned
to
hate
i
not
make
the
trip
again
not
for
a
whole
winter
unless
i
sent
at
the
point
of
a
gun
he
said
to
captain
rifle
a
few
moments
after
mary
standish
had
left
the
deck
an
eskimo
winter
is
long
enough
but
one
in
seattle
minneapolis
chicago
and
new
york
is
longer
for
me
i
understand
they
had
you
up
before
the
committee
on
ways
and
means
at
washington
yes
along
with
carl
lomen
of
nome
but
lomen
was
the
real
man
he
has
forty
thousand
head
of
reindeer
in
the
seward
peninsula
and
they
had
to
listen
to
him
we
may
get
action
may
captain
rifle
grunted
his
doubt
alaska
has
been
waiting
ten
years
for
a
new
deck
and
a
new
deal
i
doubt
if
you
get
anything
when
politicians
from
iowa
and
south
texas
tell
us
what
we
can
have
and
what
we
need
north
of
why
what
the
use
alaska
might
as
well
shut
up
shop
but
she
is
going
to
do
that
said
alan
holt
his
face
grimly
set
in
the
moonlight
they
tried
hard
to
get
us
and
they
made
us
shut
up
a
lot
of
our
doors
in
we
were
thousand
whites
in
the
territory
since
then
the
politicians
at
washington
have
driven
out
nine
thousand
a
quarter
of
the
population
but
those
that
are
left
are
we
not
going
to
quit
captain
a
lot
of
us
are
alaskans
and
we
are
not
afraid
to
fight
you
mean
that
we
have
a
square
deal
within
another
five
years
or
know
the
reason
why
and
another
five
years
after
that
we
he
shipping
a
million
reindeer
carcasses
down
into
the
states
each
year
within
twenty
years
we
be
shipping
five
million
nice
thought
for
the
beef
barons
eh
but
rather
fortunate
i
think
for
the
hundred
million
americans
who
are
turning
their
grazing
lands
into
farms
and
irrigation
systems
one
of
alan
holt
hands
was
clenched
at
the
rail
until
i
went
down
this
winter
i
did
realize
just
how
bad
it
was
he
said
a
note
hard
as
iron
in
his
voice
lomen
is
a
diplomat
but
i
not
i
want
to
fight
when
i
see
such
things
fight
with
a
gun
because
we
happened
to
find
gold
up
here
they
think
alaska
is
an
orange
to
be
sucked
as
quickly
as
possible
and
that
when
the
sucking
process
is
over
the
skin
will
be
worthless
that
modern
americanism
for
you
and
are
you
not
an
american
mr
holt
so
soft
and
near
was
the
voice
that
both
men
started
then
both
turned
and
stared
close
behind
them
her
quiet
beautiful
face
flooded
with
the
stood
mary
standish
you
ask
me
a
question
madam
said
alan
holt
bowing
courteously
no
i
am
not
an
american
i
am
an
alaskan
the
girl
lips
were
parted
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
clear
please
pardon
me
for
listening
she
said
i
could
help
it
i
am
an
american
i
love
america
i
think
i
love
it
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
more
than
my
religion
even
holt
and
america
does
necessarily
mean
a
great
many
of
america
people
i
love
to
think
that
i
first
came
ashore
in
the
that
is
why
my
name
is
standish
and
i
just
wanted
to
remind
you
that
alaska
america
alan
holt
was
a
bit
amazed
the
girl
face
was
no
longer
placidly
quiet
her
eyes
were
radiant
he
sensed
the
repressed
thrill
in
her
voice
and
he
knew
that
in
the
light
of
day
he
would
have
seen
fire
in
her
cheeks
he
smiled
and
in
that
smile
he
could
not
quite
keep
back
the
cynicism
of
his
thought
and
what
do
you
know
about
alaska
miss
standish
nothing
she
said
and
yet
i
love
it
she
pointed
to
the
mountains
i
wish
i
might
have
been
born
among
them
you
are
fortunate
you
should
love
america
alaska
you
mean
no
america
there
was
a
flashing
challenge
in
her
eyes
she
was
not
speaking
apologetically
her
meaning
was
direct
the
irony
on
alan
lips
died
away
with
a
little
laugh
he
bowed
again
if
i
am
speaking
to
a
daughter
of
captain
miles
standish
who
came
over
in
the
i
stand
reproved
he
said
you
should
be
an
authority
on
americanism
if
i
am
correct
in
surmising
your
relationship
you
are
correct
she
replied
with
a
proud
little
tilt
of
her
glossy
head
though
i
think
that
only
lately
have
i
come
to
an
understanding
of
its
significance
and
its
responsibility
i
ask
your
pardon
again
for
interrupting
you
it
was
not
premeditated
it
just
happened
she
did
not
wait
for
either
of
them
to
speak
but
flashed
the
two
a
swift
smile
and
passed
down
the
promenade
the
music
had
ceased
and
the
cabins
at
last
were
emptying
themselves
of
life
a
remarkable
young
woman
alan
remarked
i
imagine
that
the
spirit
of
captain
miles
standish
may
be
a
little
proud
of
this
particular
a
chip
off
the
old
block
you
might
say
one
would
almost
suppose
he
had
married
priscilla
and
this
young
lady
was
a
definite
though
rather
indirect
result
he
had
a
curious
way
of
laughing
without
any
more
visible
manifestation
of
humor
than
spoken
words
it
was
a
quality
in
his
voice
which
one
could
not
miss
and
at
times
when
ironically
amused
it
carried
a
sting
which
he
did
not
altogether
intend
in
another
moment
mary
standish
was
forgotten
and
he
was
asking
the
captain
a
question
which
was
in
his
mind
the
itinerary
of
this
ship
is
rather
confused
is
it
not
yes
rather
acknowledged
captain
rifle
hereafter
she
will
ply
directly
between
seattle
and
nome
but
this
time
we
doing
the
inside
passage
to
juneau
and
skagway
and
will
make
the
aleutian
passage
via
cordova
and
seward
a
whim
of
the
owners
which
they
have
seen
fit
to
explain
to
me
possibly
the
canadian
junket
aboard
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
we
landing
them
at
skagway
where
they
make
the
yukon
by
way
of
white
horse
pass
a
pleasure
trip
for
flabby
people
nowadays
holt
i
can
remember
so
can
i
nodded
alan
holt
looking
at
the
mountains
beyond
which
lay
the
trails
of
the
gold
stampede
of
a
generation
before
i
remember
and
old
donald
is
dreaming
of
that
hell
of
death
back
there
he
was
all
choked
up
tonight
i
wish
he
might
forget
men
do
forget
such
women
as
jane
hope
said
the
captain
softly
you
knew
her
yes
she
came
up
with
her
father
on
my
ship
that
was
years
ago
last
autumn
alan
a
long
time
is
it
and
when
i
look
at
mary
standish
and
hear
her
voice
he
hesitated
as
if
betraying
a
secret
and
then
he
added
i
ca
help
thinking
of
the
girl
donald
hardwick
fought
for
and
won
in
that
at
white
horse
it
too
bad
she
had
to
die
she
is
dead
said
alan
the
hardness
was
gone
from
his
voice
she
is
dead
he
repeated
that
the
pity
of
it
she
is
as
much
a
living
thing
to
him
today
as
she
was
twenty
years
ago
after
a
moment
the
captain
said
she
was
talking
with
him
early
this
evening
alan
miss
captain
miles
standish
you
mean
yes
there
seems
to
be
something
about
her
that
amuses
you
alan
shrugged
his
shoulders
not
at
all
i
think
she
is
a
most
admirable
young
person
will
you
have
a
cigar
captain
i
going
to
promenade
a
bit
it
does
me
good
to
mix
in
with
the
the
two
lighted
their
cigars
from
a
single
match
and
alan
went
his
way
while
the
captain
turned
in
the
direction
of
his
cabin
to
alan
on
this
particular
night
the
steamship
was
more
than
a
thing
of
wood
and
steel
it
was
a
living
pulsating
being
throbbing
with
the
very
of
alaska
the
purr
of
the
mighty
engines
was
a
human
intelligence
crooning
a
song
of
joy
for
him
the
crowded
passenger
list
held
a
significance
that
was
almost
epic
and
its
names
represented
more
than
mere
men
and
women
they
were
the
vital
fiber
of
the
land
he
loved
its
heart
blood
its
very
element
giving
in
he
knew
that
with
the
throb
of
those
engines
romance
adventure
tragedy
and
hope
were
on
their
way
north
and
with
these
things
also
arrogance
and
greed
on
board
were
a
hundred
conflicting
elements
some
that
had
fought
for
alaska
others
that
would
make
her
and
others
that
would
destroy
he
puffed
at
his
cigar
and
walked
alone
brushing
sleeves
with
men
and
women
whom
he
scarcely
seemed
to
notice
but
he
was
observant
he
knew
the
tourists
almost
without
looking
at
them
the
spirit
of
the
north
had
not
yet
seized
upon
them
they
were
voluble
and
rather
excitedly
enthusiastic
in
the
face
of
beauty
and
awesomeness
the
were
tucked
away
here
and
there
in
shadowy
nooks
watching
in
silence
or
they
walked
the
deck
slowly
and
quietly
smoking
their
cigars
or
pipes
and
seeing
things
beyond
the
mountains
between
these
two
the
newcomers
and
the
ran
the
gamut
of
all
human
thrill
for
alan
the
fiber
of
everything
that
went
to
make
up
life
north
of
and
he
could
have
gone
from
man
to
man
and
picked
out
those
who
belonged
north
of
aft
of
the
he
paused
tipping
the
ash
of
his
cigar
over
the
edge
of
the
rail
a
little
group
of
three
stood
near
him
and
he
recognized
them
as
the
young
engineers
fresh
from
college
going
up
to
work
on
the
government
railroad
running
from
seward
to
tanana
one
of
them
was
talking
filled
with
the
enthusiasm
of
his
first
adventure
i
tell
you
he
said
people
do
know
what
they
ought
to
know
about
alaska
in
school
they
teach
us
that
it
an
eternal
icebox
full
of
gold
and
is
headquarters
for
santa
claus
because
that
where
reindeer
come
from
and
think
about
the
same
thing
why
he
drew
in
a
deep
breath
it
nine
times
as
large
as
the
state
of
washington
twelve
times
as
big
as
the
state
of
new
york
and
we
bought
it
from
russia
for
less
than
two
cents
an
acre
if
you
put
it
down
on
the
face
of
the
united
states
the
city
of
juneau
would
be
in
augustine
florida
and
unalaska
would
be
in
los
angeles
that
how
big
it
is
and
the
geographical
center
of
our
country
is
omaha
or
sioux
city
but
exactly
san
francisco
california
good
for
you
sonny
came
a
quiet
voice
from
beyond
the
group
your
geography
is
correct
and
you
might
add
for
the
education
of
your
people
that
alaska
is
only
miles
from
bolshevik
siberia
and
wireless
messages
are
sent
into
alaska
by
the
bolsheviks
urging
our
people
to
rise
against
the
washington
government
we
asked
washington
for
a
few
guns
and
a
few
men
to
guard
nome
but
they
laugh
at
us
do
you
see
a
moral
from
interest
alan
jerked
himself
to
alert
tension
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
gaunt
old
graybeard
who
had
spoken
but
did
not
know
him
and
as
this
man
turned
away
a
shadowy
hulk
in
the
moonlight
the
same
deep
quiet
voice
came
back
very
clearly
and
if
you
ever
care
for
alaska
you
might
tell
your
government
to
hang
a
few
such
men
as
john
graham
sonny
at
the
sound
of
that
name
alan
felt
the
blood
in
him
run
suddenly
hot
only
one
man
on
the
face
of
the
earth
did
he
hate
with
undying
hatred
and
that
man
was
john
graham
he
would
have
followed
seeking
the
identity
of
the
stranger
whose
words
had
temporarily
stunned
the
young
engineers
when
he
saw
a
slim
figure
standing
between
him
and
the
light
of
the
windows
it
was
mary
standish
he
knew
by
her
attitude
that
she
had
heard
the
words
of
the
young
engineer
and
the
old
graybeard
but
she
was
looking
at
and
he
could
not
remember
that
he
had
ever
seen
quite
that
same
look
in
a
woman
face
before
it
was
not
fright
it
was
more
an
expression
of
horror
which
comes
from
thought
and
mental
vision
rather
than
physical
things
instantly
it
annoyed
alan
holt
this
was
the
second
time
she
had
betrayed
a
too
susceptible
reaction
in
matters
which
did
not
concern
her
so
he
said
speaking
to
the
silent
young
men
a
few
steps
away
he
was
mistaken
gentlemen
john
graham
should
not
be
hung
that
would
be
too
merciful
he
resumed
his
way
then
nodding
at
them
as
he
passed
but
he
had
scarcely
gone
out
of
their
vision
when
quick
footsteps
pattered
behind
him
and
the
girl
hand
touched
his
arm
lightly
holt
please
he
stopped
sensing
the
fact
that
the
soft
pressure
of
her
fingers
was
not
altogether
unpleasant
she
hesitated
and
when
she
spoke
again
only
her
touched
his
arm
she
was
looking
shoreward
so
that
for
a
moment
he
could
see
only
the
lustrous
richness
of
her
smooth
hair
then
she
was
meeting
his
eyes
squarely
a
flash
of
challenge
in
the
gray
depths
of
her
own
i
am
alone
on
the
ship
she
said
i
have
no
friends
here
i
want
to
see
things
and
ask
questions
will
you
help
me
a
little
you
mean
escort
you
yes
if
you
will
i
should
feel
more
comfortable
nettled
at
first
the
humor
of
the
situation
began
to
appeal
to
him
and
he
wondered
at
the
intense
seriousness
of
the
girl
she
did
not
smile
her
eyes
were
very
steady
and
very
businesslike
and
at
the
same
time
very
lovely
the
way
you
put
it
i
do
see
how
i
can
refuse
he
said
as
for
the
questions
probably
captain
rifle
can
answer
them
better
than
i
i
do
like
to
trouble
him
she
replied
he
has
much
to
think
about
and
you
are
alone
yes
quite
alone
and
with
very
little
to
think
about
you
know
what
i
mean
holt
possibly
you
can
not
understand
me
or
wo
try
but
i
going
into
a
new
country
and
i
have
a
passionate
desire
to
learn
as
much
about
that
country
as
i
can
before
i
get
there
i
want
to
know
about
many
things
for
instance
yes
why
did
you
say
what
you
did
about
john
graham
what
did
the
other
man
mean
when
he
said
he
should
be
hung
there
was
an
intense
directness
in
her
question
which
for
a
moment
astonished
him
she
had
withdrawn
her
fingers
from
his
arm
and
her
slim
figure
seemed
possessed
of
a
sudden
throbbing
suspense
as
she
waited
for
an
answer
they
had
turned
a
little
so
that
in
the
light
of
the
moon
the
almost
flowerlike
whiteness
of
her
face
was
clear
to
him
with
her
smooth
shining
hair
the
pallor
of
her
face
under
its
lustrous
darkness
and
the
clearness
of
her
eyes
she
held
alan
speechless
for
a
moment
while
his
brain
struggled
to
seize
upon
and
understand
the
something
about
her
which
made
him
interested
in
spite
of
himself
then
he
smiled
and
there
was
a
sudden
glitter
in
his
eyes
did
you
ever
see
a
dog
fight
he
asked
she
hesitated
as
if
trying
to
remember
and
shuddered
slightly
once
what
happened
it
was
my
dog
a
little
dog
his
throat
was
torn
he
nodded
exactly
and
that
is
just
what
john
graham
is
doing
to
alaska
miss
standish
he
the
dog
a
monster
imagine
a
man
with
a
colossal
financial
power
behind
him
setting
out
to
strip
the
wealth
from
a
new
land
and
enslave
it
to
his
own
desires
and
political
ambitions
that
is
what
john
graham
is
doing
from
his
down
there
in
the
states
it
the
financial
support
he
represents
curse
him
money
and
a
man
without
conscience
a
man
who
would
starve
thousands
or
millions
to
achieve
his
ends
a
man
who
in
every
sense
of
the
word
is
a
murderer
the
sharpness
of
her
cry
stopped
him
if
possible
her
face
had
gone
whiter
and
he
saw
her
hands
clutched
suddenly
at
her
breast
and
the
look
in
her
eyes
brought
the
old
cynical
twist
back
to
his
lips
there
i
hurt
your
puritanism
again
miss
standish
he
said
bowing
a
little
in
order
to
appeal
to
your
finer
sensibilities
i
suppose
i
must
apologize
for
swearing
and
calling
another
man
a
murderer
well
i
do
and
now
if
you
care
to
stroll
about
the
ship
from
a
respectful
distance
the
three
young
engineers
watched
alan
and
mary
standish
as
they
walked
forward
a
corking
pretty
girl
said
one
of
them
drawing
a
deep
breath
i
never
saw
such
hair
and
eyes
i
at
the
same
table
with
them
interrupted
another
i
second
on
her
left
and
she
has
spoken
three
words
to
me
and
that
fellow
she
is
with
is
like
an
icicle
out
of
labrador
and
mary
standish
was
saying
do
you
know
holt
i
envy
those
young
engineers
i
wish
i
were
a
man
i
wish
you
were
agreed
alan
amiably
whereupon
mary
standish
pretty
mouth
lost
its
softness
for
an
instant
but
alan
did
not
observe
this
he
was
enjoying
his
cigar
and
the
sweet
air
chapter
iii
alan
holt
was
a
man
whom
other
men
looked
at
twice
with
women
it
was
different
he
was
in
no
solitary
sense
of
the
word
a
woman
man
he
admired
them
in
an
abstract
way
and
he
was
ready
to
fight
for
them
or
die
for
them
at
any
time
such
a
course
became
necessary
but
his
sentiment
was
entirely
a
matter
of
common
sense
his
chivalry
was
born
and
bred
of
the
mountains
and
the
open
and
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
insincere
brand
which
develops
in
the
softer
and
more
luxurious
laps
of
civilization
years
of
aloneness
had
put
their
mark
upon
him
men
of
the
north
reading
the
lines
understood
what
they
meant
but
only
now
and
then
could
a
woman
possibly
understand
yet
if
in
any
given
moment
a
supreme
physical
crisis
had
come
women
would
have
turned
instinctively
in
their
helplessness
to
such
a
man
as
alan
holt
he
possessed
a
vein
of
humor
which
few
had
been
privileged
to
discover
the
mountains
had
taught
him
to
laugh
in
silence
with
him
a
chuckle
meant
as
much
as
a
riotous
outburst
of
merriment
from
another
and
he
could
enjoy
greatly
without
any
noticeable
muscular
disturbance
of
his
face
and
not
always
was
his
smile
a
reflection
of
humorous
thought
there
were
times
when
it
betrayed
another
kind
of
thought
more
forcefully
than
speech
because
he
understood
fairly
well
and
knew
what
he
was
the
present
situation
amused
him
he
could
not
but
see
what
an
error
in
judgment
miss
standish
had
made
in
selecting
him
when
compared
with
the
intoxicating
thrill
she
could
easily
have
aroused
by
choosing
one
of
the
young
engineers
as
a
companion
in
her
evening
adventure
he
chuckled
and
mary
standish
hearing
the
smothered
note
of
amusement
gave
to
her
head
that
swift
little
birdlike
tilt
which
he
had
observed
once
before
in
the
presence
of
captain
rifle
but
she
said
nothing
as
if
challenged
she
calmly
took
possession
of
his
arm
halfway
round
the
deck
alan
began
to
sense
the
fact
that
there
was
a
decidedly
pleasant
flavor
to
the
whole
thing
the
girl
hand
did
not
merely
touch
his
arm
it
was
snuggled
there
confidently
and
she
was
necessarily
so
close
to
him
that
when
he
looked
down
the
glossy
coils
of
her
hair
were
within
a
few
inches
of
his
face
his
nearness
to
her
together
with
the
soft
pressure
of
her
hand
on
his
arm
was
a
jolt
to
his
stoicism
it
not
half
bad
he
expressed
himself
frankly
i
really
believe
i
am
going
to
enjoy
answering
your
questions
miss
standish
oh
he
felt
the
slim
little
figure
stiffen
for
an
instant
you
thought
possibly
i
might
be
dangerous
a
little
i
do
understand
women
collectively
i
think
they
are
most
wonderful
handiwork
individually
i
do
care
much
about
them
but
you
she
nodded
approvingly
that
is
very
nice
of
you
but
you
need
say
i
am
different
from
the
others
i
am
not
all
women
are
alike
possibly
except
in
the
way
they
dress
their
hair
you
like
mine
very
much
he
was
amazed
at
the
admission
so
much
so
that
he
puffed
out
a
huge
cloud
of
smoke
from
his
cigar
in
mental
protest
they
had
come
to
the
again
this
was
an
innovation
aboard
the
there
was
no
other
like
it
in
the
alaskan
service
with
its
luxurious
space
its
comfortable
hospitality
and
the
observation
parlor
built
at
one
end
for
those
ladies
who
cared
to
sit
with
their
husbands
while
they
smoked
their
cigars
if
you
want
to
hear
about
alaska
and
see
some
of
its
human
let
go
in
he
suggested
i
know
of
no
better
place
are
you
afraid
of
smoke
no
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
smoke
perhaps
you
do
i
do
not
when
i
begin
that
if
you
please
i
shall
bob
my
hair
which
would
be
a
crime
he
replied
so
earnestly
that
again
he
was
surprised
at
himself
two
or
three
ladies
with
their
escorts
were
in
the
parlor
when
they
entered
the
huge
main
room
covering
a
third
of
the
aft
deck
was
blue
with
smoke
a
score
of
men
were
playing
cards
at
round
tables
twice
as
many
were
gathered
in
groups
talking
while
others
walked
aimlessly
up
and
down
the
carpeted
floor
here
and
there
were
men
who
sat
alone
a
few
were
asleep
which
made
alan
look
at
his
watch
then
he
observed
mary
standish
studying
the
innumerable
bundles
of
neatly
rolled
blankets
that
lay
about
one
of
them
was
at
her
feet
she
touched
it
with
her
toe
what
do
they
mean
she
asked
we
are
overloaded
he
explained
alaskan
have
no
steerage
passengers
as
we
generally
know
them
it
is
poverty
that
rides
steerage
when
you
go
north
you
can
always
find
a
millionaire
or
two
on
the
lower
deck
when
they
get
sleepy
most
of
the
men
you
see
in
there
will
unroll
blankets
and
sleep
on
the
floor
did
you
ever
see
an
earl
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
make
explanations
now
that
he
had
brought
her
in
and
directed
her
attention
to
the
third
table
on
their
left
three
men
were
seated
at
this
table
the
man
facing
us
the
one
with
a
flabby
face
and
pale
mustache
is
an
earl
i
forget
his
name
he
said
he
does
look
it
but
he
is
a
real
sport
he
is
going
up
to
shoot
kadiak
bears
and
sleeps
on
the
floor
the
group
beyond
them
at
the
fifth
table
are
treadwell
mining
men
and
that
fellow
you
see
slouched
against
the
wall
half
asleep
with
whiskers
nearly
to
his
waist
is
stampede
smith
an
partner
of
george
carmack
who
discovered
gold
on
bonanza
creek
in
the
thud
of
carmack
spade
as
it
hit
first
pay
was
the
heard
round
the
world
miss
standish
and
the
gentleman
with
crumpled
whiskers
was
the
man
at
bonanza
excepting
skookum
jim
and
taglish
charlie
two
siwah
indians
who
were
with
carmack
when
the
strike
was
made
also
if
you
care
for
the
romantic
he
was
in
love
with
belinda
mulrooney
the
most
courageous
woman
who
ever
came
into
the
north
why
was
she
courageous
because
she
came
alone
into
a
man
land
without
a
soul
to
fight
for
her
determined
to
make
a
fortune
along
with
the
others
and
she
did
as
long
as
there
is
a
dawson
alive
he
will
remember
belinda
mulrooney
she
proved
what
a
woman
could
do
mr
holt
yes
and
a
little
later
she
proved
how
foolish
a
woman
can
be
miss
standish
she
became
the
richest
woman
in
dawson
then
came
a
man
who
posed
as
a
count
belinda
married
him
and
they
went
to
paris
i
think
now
if
she
had
married
stampede
smith
over
there
with
his
big
whiskers
he
did
not
finish
half
a
dozen
paces
from
them
a
man
had
risen
from
a
table
and
was
facing
them
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
him
except
his
boldness
as
he
looked
at
mary
standish
it
was
as
if
he
knew
her
and
was
deliberately
insulting
her
in
a
stare
that
was
more
than
impudent
in
its
directness
then
a
sudden
twist
came
to
his
lips
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
and
turned
away
alan
glanced
swiftly
at
his
companion
her
lips
were
compressed
and
her
cheeks
were
flaming
hotly
even
then
as
his
own
blood
boiled
he
could
not
but
observe
how
beautiful
anger
made
her
if
you
will
pardon
me
a
moment
he
said
quietly
i
shall
demand
an
explanation
her
hand
linked
itself
quickly
through
his
arm
please
do
she
entreated
it
is
kind
of
you
and
you
are
just
the
sort
of
man
i
should
expect
to
resent
a
thing
like
that
but
it
would
be
absurd
to
notice
it
do
you
think
so
in
spite
of
her
effort
to
speak
calmly
there
was
a
tremble
in
her
voice
and
alan
was
puzzled
at
the
quickness
with
which
the
color
went
from
her
face
leaving
it
strangely
white
i
am
at
your
service
he
replied
with
a
rather
cold
inclination
of
his
head
but
if
you
were
my
sister
miss
standish
i
would
not
allow
anything
like
that
to
go
unchallenged
he
watched
the
stranger
until
he
disappeared
through
a
door
out
upon
the
deck
one
of
john
graham
men
he
said
a
fellow
named
rossland
going
up
to
get
a
final
grip
on
the
salmon
fishing
i
understand
they
choke
the
life
out
of
it
in
another
two
years
funny
what
this
filthy
stuff
we
call
money
can
do
is
it
two
winters
ago
i
saw
whole
indian
villages
starving
and
women
and
little
children
dying
by
the
score
because
of
this
john
graham
money
did
it
you
understand
if
you
could
have
seen
some
of
those
poor
little
devils
just
skin
and
bones
crying
for
a
rag
to
eat
her
hand
clutched
at
his
arm
how
could
john
graham
do
that
she
whispered
he
laughed
unpleasantly
when
you
have
been
a
year
in
alaska
you
ask
that
question
miss
standish
why
simply
by
glutting
his
canneries
and
taking
from
the
streams
the
food
supply
which
the
natives
have
depended
upon
for
generations
in
other
words
the
money
he
handles
represents
the
fish
trust
and
many
other
things
please
misunderstand
me
alaska
needs
capital
for
its
development
without
it
we
will
not
only
cease
to
progress
we
will
die
no
territory
on
the
face
of
the
earth
offers
greater
opportunities
for
capital
than
alaska
does
today
ten
thousand
fortunes
are
waiting
to
be
made
here
by
men
who
have
money
to
invest
but
john
graham
does
not
represent
the
type
we
want
he
is
a
despoiler
one
of
those
whose
only
desire
is
to
turn
original
resource
into
dollars
as
fast
as
he
can
even
though
those
operations
make
both
land
and
water
barren
you
must
remember
until
recently
the
government
of
alaska
as
manipulated
by
washington
politicians
was
little
better
than
that
against
which
the
american
colonies
rebelled
in
a
hard
thing
for
one
to
say
about
the
country
he
loves
is
it
and
john
graham
stands
for
the
worst
he
and
the
money
which
guarantees
his
power
as
a
matter
of
fact
big
and
legitimate
capital
is
fighting
shy
of
alaska
conditions
are
such
thanks
to
and
bad
politics
that
capital
big
and
little
looks
askance
at
alaska
and
can
not
be
interested
think
of
it
miss
standish
there
are
separate
bureaus
at
washington
operating
on
alaska
five
thousand
miles
away
is
it
a
wonder
the
patient
is
sick
and
is
it
a
wonder
that
a
man
like
john
graham
dishonest
and
corrupt
to
the
soul
has
a
fertile
field
to
work
in
but
we
are
progressing
we
are
slowly
coming
out
from
under
the
shadow
which
has
so
long
clouded
alaska
interests
there
is
now
a
growing
concentration
of
authority
and
responsibility
both
the
department
of
the
interior
and
the
department
of
agriculture
now
realize
that
alaska
is
a
mighty
empire
in
itself
and
with
their
help
we
are
bound
to
go
ahead
in
spite
of
all
our
handicaps
it
is
men
like
john
graham
i
fear
some
day
suddenly
he
caught
himself
there
i
talking
politics
and
i
should
entertain
you
with
pleasanter
and
more
interesting
things
he
apologized
shall
we
go
to
the
lower
decks
or
the
open
air
she
suggested
i
am
afraid
this
smoke
is
upsetting
me
he
could
feel
the
change
in
her
and
did
not
attribute
it
entirely
to
the
thickness
of
the
air
rossland
inexplicable
rudeness
had
disturbed
her
more
deeply
than
she
had
admitted
he
believed
there
are
a
number
of
thlinkit
indians
and
a
tame
bear
down
in
what
we
should
ordinarily
call
the
steerage
would
you
like
to
see
them
he
asked
when
they
were
outside
the
thlinkit
girls
are
the
prettiest
indian
women
in
the
world
and
there
are
two
among
those
below
who
are
well
unusually
the
captain
says
and
he
has
already
made
me
acquainted
with
them
she
laughed
softly
kolo
and
haidah
are
the
girls
they
are
sweet
and
i
love
them
i
had
breakfast
with
them
this
morning
long
before
you
were
awake
the
deuce
you
say
and
that
is
why
you
were
not
at
table
and
the
morning
before
you
noticed
my
absence
she
asked
demurely
it
was
difficult
for
me
not
to
see
an
empty
chair
on
second
thought
i
think
the
young
engineer
called
my
attention
to
it
by
wondering
if
you
were
oh
he
is
very
much
interested
in
you
miss
standish
it
amuses
me
to
see
him
torture
the
corners
of
his
eyes
to
look
at
you
i
have
thought
it
would
be
only
charity
and
to
change
seats
with
him
in
which
event
of
course
your
eyes
would
not
suffer
probably
not
have
they
ever
suffered
i
think
not
when
looking
at
the
thlinkit
girls
for
instance
i
have
seen
them
she
gave
her
shoulders
a
little
shrug
ordinarily
i
would
think
you
most
uninteresting
holt
as
it
is
i
think
you
unusual
and
i
rather
like
you
for
it
would
you
mind
taking
me
to
my
cabin
it
is
number
sixteen
on
this
deck
she
walked
with
her
fingers
touching
his
arm
again
what
is
your
room
she
asked
miss
standish
this
deck
yes
not
until
she
had
said
good
night
quietly
and
without
offering
him
her
hand
did
the
intimacy
of
her
last
questions
strike
him
he
grunted
and
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
a
number
of
things
occurred
to
him
all
at
once
as
he
slowly
made
a
final
round
or
two
of
the
deck
then
he
went
to
his
cabin
and
looked
over
papers
which
were
going
ashore
at
juneau
these
were
memoranda
giving
an
account
of
his
appearance
with
carl
lomen
before
the
ways
and
means
committee
at
washington
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
he
had
finished
he
wondered
if
mary
standish
was
asleep
he
was
a
little
irritated
and
slightly
amused
by
the
recurring
insistency
with
which
his
mind
turned
to
her
she
was
a
clever
girl
he
admitted
he
had
asked
her
nothing
about
herself
and
she
had
told
him
nothing
while
he
had
been
quite
garrulous
he
was
a
little
ashamed
when
he
recalled
how
he
had
unburdened
his
mind
to
a
girl
who
could
not
possibly
be
interested
in
the
political
affairs
of
john
graham
and
alaska
well
it
was
not
entirely
his
fault
she
had
fairly
catapulted
herself
upon
him
and
he
had
been
decent
under
the
circumstances
he
thought
he
put
out
his
light
and
stood
with
his
face
at
the
open
only
the
soft
throbbing
of
the
vessel
as
she
made
her
way
slowly
through
the
last
of
the
narrows
into
frederick
sound
came
to
his
ears
the
ship
at
last
was
asleep
the
moon
was
straight
overhead
no
longer
silhouetting
the
mountains
and
beyond
its
misty
rim
of
light
the
world
was
dark
out
of
this
darkness
rising
like
a
deeper
shadow
alan
could
make
out
faintly
the
huge
mass
of
kupreanof
island
and
he
wondered
knowing
the
perils
of
the
narrows
in
places
scarcely
wider
than
the
length
of
the
ship
why
captain
rifle
had
chosen
this
course
instead
of
going
around
by
cape
decision
he
could
feel
that
the
land
was
more
distant
now
but
the
was
still
pushing
ahead
under
slow
bell
and
he
could
smell
the
fresh
odor
of
kelp
and
breathe
deeply
of
the
scent
of
forests
that
came
from
both
east
and
west
suddenly
his
ears
became
attentive
to
slowly
approaching
footsteps
they
seemed
to
hesitate
and
then
advanced
he
heard
a
subdued
voice
a
man
voice
and
in
answer
to
it
a
woman
instinctively
he
drew
a
step
back
and
stood
unseen
in
the
gloom
there
was
no
longer
a
sound
of
voices
in
silence
they
walked
past
his
window
clearly
revealed
to
him
in
the
moonlight
one
of
the
two
was
mary
standish
the
man
was
rossland
who
had
stared
at
her
so
boldly
in
the
amazement
gripped
alan
he
switched
on
his
light
and
made
his
final
arrangements
for
bed
he
had
no
inclination
to
spy
upon
either
mary
standish
or
graham
agent
but
he
possessed
an
inborn
hatred
of
fraud
and
humbug
and
what
he
had
seen
convinced
him
that
mary
standish
knew
more
about
rossland
than
she
had
allowed
him
to
believe
she
had
not
lied
to
him
she
had
said
nothing
at
all
except
to
restrain
him
from
demanding
an
apology
evidently
she
had
taken
advantage
of
him
but
beyond
that
fact
her
affairs
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
own
business
in
life
possibly
she
and
rossland
had
quarreled
and
now
they
were
making
up
quite
probable
he
thought
silly
of
him
to
think
over
the
matter
at
all
so
he
put
out
his
light
again
and
went
to
bed
but
he
had
no
great
desire
to
sleep
it
was
pleasant
to
lie
there
flat
on
his
back
with
the
soothing
movement
of
the
ship
under
him
listening
to
the
musical
thrum
of
it
and
it
was
pleasant
to
think
of
the
fact
that
he
was
going
home
how
infernally
long
those
seven
months
had
been
down
in
the
states
and
how
he
had
missed
everyone
he
had
ever
known
even
his
enemies
he
closed
his
eyes
and
visualized
the
home
that
was
still
thousands
of
miles
away
the
endless
tundras
the
blue
and
purple
foothills
of
the
endicott
mountains
and
alan
range
at
the
beginning
of
them
spring
was
breaking
up
there
and
it
was
warm
on
the
tundras
and
the
southern
slopes
and
the
buds
were
popping
out
of
their
coats
like
corn
from
a
hopper
he
prayed
god
the
months
had
been
kind
to
his
people
the
people
of
the
range
it
was
a
long
time
to
be
away
from
them
when
one
loved
them
as
he
did
he
was
sure
that
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
his
two
chief
herdsmen
would
care
for
things
as
well
as
himself
but
much
could
happen
in
seven
months
nawadlook
the
little
beauty
of
his
distant
kingdom
was
not
looking
well
when
he
left
he
was
worried
about
her
the
pneumonia
of
the
previous
winters
had
left
its
mark
and
keok
her
rival
in
prettiness
he
smiled
in
the
darkness
wondering
how
tautuk
sometimes
hopeless
love
affair
had
progressed
for
keok
was
a
little
and
had
long
reveled
in
tautuk
sufferings
an
archangel
of
iniquity
alan
thought
as
he
grinned
but
worth
any
man
risk
of
life
if
he
had
but
a
drop
of
brown
blood
in
him
as
for
his
herds
they
had
undoubtedly
fared
well
ten
thousand
head
was
something
to
be
proud
of
suddenly
he
drew
in
his
breath
and
listened
someone
was
at
his
door
and
had
paused
there
twice
he
had
heard
footsteps
outside
but
each
time
they
had
passed
he
sat
up
and
the
springs
of
his
berth
made
a
sound
under
him
he
heard
movement
then
a
swift
running
movement
and
he
switched
on
his
light
a
moment
later
he
opened
the
door
no
one
was
there
the
long
corridor
was
empty
and
then
a
distance
away
he
heard
the
soft
opening
and
closing
of
another
door
it
was
then
that
his
eyes
saw
a
white
crumpled
object
on
the
floor
he
picked
it
up
and
reentered
his
room
it
was
a
woman
handkerchief
and
he
had
seen
it
before
he
had
admired
the
pretty
laciness
of
it
that
evening
in
the
rather
curious
he
thought
that
he
should
now
find
it
at
his
door
chapter
iv
for
a
few
minutes
after
finding
the
handkerchief
at
his
door
alan
experienced
a
feeling
of
mingled
curiosity
and
disappointment
also
a
certain
resentment
the
suspicion
that
he
was
becoming
involved
in
spite
of
himself
was
not
altogether
pleasant
the
evening
up
to
a
certain
point
had
been
fairly
entertaining
it
was
true
he
might
have
passed
a
pleasanter
hour
recalling
old
times
with
stampede
smith
or
discussing
kadiak
bears
with
the
english
earl
or
striking
up
an
acquaintance
with
the
unknown
graybeard
who
had
voiced
an
opinion
about
john
graham
but
he
was
not
regretting
lost
hours
nor
was
he
holding
mary
standish
accountable
for
them
it
was
last
of
all
the
handkerchief
that
momentarily
upset
him
why
had
she
dropped
it
at
his
door
it
was
not
a
affair
to
be
sure
with
its
filmy
lace
edging
and
ridiculous
diminutiveness
as
the
question
came
to
him
he
was
wondering
how
even
as
dainty
a
nose
as
that
possessed
by
mary
standish
could
be
much
comforted
by
it
but
it
was
pretty
and
like
mary
standish
there
was
something
exquisitely
quiet
and
perfect
about
it
like
the
simplicity
of
her
hair
he
was
not
analyzing
the
matter
it
was
a
thought
that
came
to
him
almost
unconsciously
as
he
tossed
the
annoying
bit
of
fabric
on
the
little
table
at
the
head
of
his
berth
undoubtedly
the
dropping
of
it
had
been
entirely
unpremeditated
and
accidental
at
least
he
told
himself
so
and
he
also
assured
himself
with
an
involuntary
shrug
of
his
shoulders
that
any
woman
or
girl
had
the
right
to
pass
his
door
if
she
so
desired
and
that
he
was
an
idiot
for
thinking
otherwise
the
argument
was
only
slightly
adequate
but
alan
was
not
interested
in
mysteries
especially
when
they
had
to
do
with
woman
and
such
an
absurdly
inconsequential
thing
as
a
handkerchief
a
second
time
he
went
to
bed
he
fell
asleep
thinking
about
keok
and
nawadlook
and
the
people
of
his
range
from
somewhere
he
had
been
given
the
priceless
heritage
of
dreaming
pleasantly
and
keok
was
very
real
with
her
swift
smile
and
mischievous
face
and
nawadlook
big
soft
eyes
were
brighter
than
when
he
had
gone
away
he
saw
tautuk
gloomy
as
usual
over
the
heartlessness
of
keok
he
was
beating
a
that
gave
out
the
peculiar
sound
of
bells
and
to
this
amuk
toolik
was
dancing
the
bear
dance
while
keok
clapped
her
hands
in
exaggerated
admiration
even
in
his
dreams
alan
chuckled
he
knew
what
was
happening
and
that
out
of
the
corners
of
her
laughing
eyes
keok
was
enjoying
tautuk
jealousy
tautuk
was
so
stupid
he
would
never
understand
that
was
the
funny
part
of
it
and
he
beat
his
drum
savagely
scowling
so
that
he
almost
shut
his
eyes
while
keok
laughed
outright
it
was
then
that
alan
opened
his
eyes
and
heard
the
last
of
the
bells
it
was
still
dark
he
turned
on
the
light
and
looked
at
his
watch
tautuk
drum
had
tolled
eight
bells
aboard
the
ship
and
it
was
four
in
the
morning
through
the
open
port
came
the
smell
of
sea
and
land
and
with
it
a
chill
air
which
alan
drank
in
deeply
as
he
stretched
himself
for
a
few
minutes
after
awakening
the
tang
of
it
was
like
wine
in
his
blood
and
he
got
up
quietly
and
dressed
while
he
smoked
the
of
a
cigar
he
had
laid
aside
at
midnight
not
until
he
had
finished
dressing
did
he
notice
the
handkerchief
on
the
table
if
its
presence
had
suggested
a
significance
a
few
hours
before
he
no
longer
disturbed
himself
by
thinking
about
it
a
bit
of
carelessness
on
the
girl
part
that
was
all
he
would
return
it
mechanically
he
put
the
crumpled
bit
of
cambric
in
his
coat
pocket
before
going
on
deck
he
had
guessed
that
he
would
be
alone
the
promenade
was
deserted
through
the
mist
of
morning
he
saw
the
rows
of
empty
chairs
and
lights
burning
dully
in
the
asian
monsoon
and
the
drifting
warmth
of
the
japan
current
had
brought
an
early
spring
to
the
alexander
archipelago
and
may
had
stolen
much
of
the
flowering
softness
of
june
but
the
dawns
of
these
days
were
chilly
and
gray
mists
and
fogs
settled
in
the
valleys
and
like
thin
smoke
rolled
down
the
sides
of
the
mountains
to
the
sea
so
that
a
ship
traveling
the
inner
waters
felt
its
way
like
a
child
creeping
in
darkness
alan
loved
this
idiosyncrasy
of
the
alaskan
coast
the
phantom
mystery
of
it
was
stimulating
and
in
the
peril
of
it
was
a
challenging
lure
he
could
feel
the
care
with
which
the
was
picking
her
way
northward
her
engines
were
thrumming
softly
and
her
movement
was
a
slow
and
cautious
glide
catlike
and
slightly
trembling
as
if
every
pound
of
steel
in
her
were
a
living
nerve
widely
alert
he
knew
captain
rifle
would
not
be
asleep
and
that
straining
eyes
were
peering
into
the
white
gloom
from
the
somewhere
west
of
them
hazardously
near
must
lie
the
rocks
of
admiralty
island
eastward
were
the
still
more
pitiless
glacial
sandstones
and
granites
of
the
coast
with
that
deadly
finger
of
reef
between
along
the
lip
of
which
they
must
creep
to
juneau
and
juneau
could
not
be
far
ahead
he
leaned
over
the
rail
puffing
at
the
stub
of
his
cigar
he
was
eager
for
his
work
juneau
skagway
and
cordova
meant
nothing
to
him
except
that
they
were
alaska
he
yearned
for
the
still
farther
north
the
wide
tundras
and
the
mighty
achievement
that
lay
ahead
of
him
there
his
blood
sang
to
the
surety
of
it
now
and
for
that
reason
he
was
not
sorry
he
had
spent
seven
months
of
loneliness
in
the
states
he
had
proved
with
his
own
eyes
that
the
day
was
near
when
alaska
would
come
into
her
own
gold
he
laughed
gold
had
its
lure
its
romance
its
thrill
but
what
was
all
the
gold
the
mountains
might
possess
compared
with
this
greater
thing
he
was
helping
to
build
it
seemed
to
him
the
people
he
had
met
in
the
south
had
thought
only
of
gold
when
they
learned
he
was
from
alaska
always
gold
that
first
and
then
ice
snow
endless
nights
desolate
barrens
and
craggy
mountains
frowning
everlastingly
upon
a
blasted
land
in
which
men
fought
against
odds
and
only
the
fittest
survived
it
was
gold
that
had
been
alaska
doom
when
people
thought
of
it
they
visioned
nothing
beyond
the
old
stampede
days
the
chilkoot
white
horse
dawson
and
circle
city
romance
and
glamor
and
the
tragedies
of
dead
men
clung
to
their
ribs
but
they
were
beginning
to
believe
now
their
eyes
were
opening
even
the
government
was
waking
up
after
proving
there
was
something
besides
graft
in
railroad
building
north
of
mount
elias
senators
and
congressmen
at
washington
had
listened
to
him
seriously
and
especially
to
carl
lomen
and
the
beef
barons
wisest
of
all
had
tried
to
buy
him
off
and
had
offered
a
fortune
for
lomen
forty
thousand
head
of
reindeer
in
the
seward
peninsula
that
was
proof
of
the
awakening
absolute
proof
he
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
and
his
mind
shot
through
the
dissolving
mist
into
the
vast
land
ahead
of
him
some
alaskans
had
cursed
theodore
roosevelt
for
putting
what
they
called
the
conservation
shackles
on
their
country
but
he
for
one
did
not
roosevelt
had
kept
the
at
bay
and
because
he
had
foreseen
what
and
greed
would
do
alaska
was
not
entirely
stripped
today
but
lay
ready
to
serve
with
all
her
mighty
resources
the
mother
who
had
neglected
her
for
a
generation
but
it
was
going
to
be
a
struggle
this
opening
up
of
a
great
land
it
must
be
done
resourcefully
and
with
intelligence
once
the
bars
were
down
roosevelt
could
not
hold
back
such
desecrating
forces
as
john
graham
and
the
syndicate
he
represented
thought
of
graham
was
an
unpleasant
reminder
and
his
face
grew
hard
in
the
alaskans
themselves
must
fight
against
the
licensed
plunderers
and
it
would
be
a
hard
fight
he
had
seen
the
pillaging
work
of
these
financial
brigands
in
a
dozen
states
during
the
past
winter
states
raped
of
their
forests
their
lakes
and
streams
robbed
and
polluted
their
resources
hewn
down
to
naked
skeletons
he
had
been
horrified
and
a
little
frightened
when
he
looked
over
the
desolation
of
michigan
once
the
richest
timber
state
in
america
what
if
the
government
at
washington
made
it
possible
for
such
a
thing
to
happen
in
alaska
politics
and
money
were
already
fighting
for
just
that
thing
he
no
longer
heard
the
throb
of
the
ship
under
his
feet
it
was
fight
and
brain
and
muscle
reacted
to
it
almost
as
if
it
had
been
a
physical
thing
and
his
end
of
that
fight
he
was
determined
to
win
if
it
took
every
year
of
his
life
he
with
a
few
others
would
prove
to
the
world
that
the
millions
of
acres
of
treeless
tundras
of
the
north
were
not
the
ends
of
the
earth
they
would
populate
them
and
the
barrens
would
thunder
to
the
innumerable
hoofs
of
reindeer
herds
as
the
american
plains
had
never
thundered
to
the
beat
of
cattle
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
treasure
he
would
find
at
the
end
of
this
rainbow
of
success
which
he
visioned
money
simply
as
money
he
hated
it
was
the
achievement
of
the
thing
that
gripped
him
the
passion
to
hew
a
trail
through
which
his
beloved
land
might
come
into
its
own
and
the
desire
to
see
it
achieve
a
final
triumph
by
feeding
a
half
of
that
america
which
had
laughed
at
it
and
kicked
it
when
it
was
down
the
tolling
of
the
ship
bell
roused
him
from
the
subconscious
struggle
into
which
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
ordinarily
he
had
no
sympathy
with
himself
when
he
fell
into
one
of
these
mental
spasms
as
he
called
them
without
knowing
it
he
was
a
little
proud
of
a
certain
dispassionate
tolerance
which
he
possessed
a
philosophical
mastery
of
his
emotions
which
at
times
was
almost
and
which
made
some
people
think
he
was
a
thing
of
stone
instead
of
flesh
and
blood
his
thrills
he
kept
to
himself
and
a
mildly
disturbing
sensation
passed
through
him
now
when
he
found
that
unconsciously
his
fingers
had
twined
themselves
about
the
little
handkerchief
in
his
pocket
he
drew
it
out
and
made
a
sudden
movement
as
if
to
toss
it
overboard
then
with
a
grunt
expressive
of
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
he
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
and
began
to
walk
slowly
toward
the
bow
of
the
ship
he
wondered
as
he
noted
the
lifting
of
the
fog
what
he
would
have
been
had
he
possessed
a
sister
like
mary
standish
or
any
family
at
all
for
that
matter
even
an
uncle
or
two
who
might
have
been
interested
in
him
he
remembered
his
father
vividly
his
mother
a
little
less
so
because
his
mother
had
died
when
he
was
six
and
his
father
when
he
was
twenty
it
was
his
father
who
stood
out
above
everything
else
like
the
mountains
he
loved
the
father
would
remain
with
him
always
inspiring
him
urging
him
encouraging
him
to
live
like
a
gentleman
fight
like
a
man
and
die
at
last
unafraid
in
that
fashion
the
older
alan
holt
had
lived
and
died
but
his
mother
her
face
and
voice
scarcely
remembered
in
the
passing
of
many
years
was
more
a
hallowed
memory
to
him
than
a
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
and
there
had
been
no
sisters
or
brothers
often
he
had
regretted
this
lack
of
brotherhood
but
a
sister
he
grunted
his
disapprobation
of
the
thought
a
sister
would
have
meant
enchainment
to
civilization
cities
probably
even
the
states
and
slavery
to
a
life
he
detested
he
appreciated
the
immensity
of
his
freedom
a
mary
standish
even
though
she
were
his
sister
would
be
a
catastrophe
he
could
not
conceive
of
her
or
any
other
woman
like
her
living
with
keok
and
nawadlook
and
the
rest
of
his
people
in
the
heart
of
the
tundras
and
the
tundras
would
always
be
his
home
because
his
heart
was
there
he
had
passed
round
the
and
came
suddenly
upon
an
odd
figure
crumpled
in
a
chair
it
was
stampede
smith
in
the
clearer
light
that
came
with
the
dissolution
of
the
alan
saw
that
he
was
not
asleep
he
paused
unseen
by
the
other
stampede
stretched
himself
groaned
and
stood
up
he
was
a
little
man
and
his
fiercely
bristling
red
whiskers
wet
with
dew
were
luxuriant
enough
for
a
giant
his
head
of
tawny
hair
bristling
like
his
whiskers
added
to
the
piratical
effect
of
him
above
the
neck
but
below
that
part
of
his
anatomy
there
was
little
to
strike
fear
into
the
hearts
of
humanity
some
people
smiled
when
they
looked
at
him
others
not
knowing
their
man
laughed
outright
whiskers
could
be
funny
and
they
were
undoubtedly
funny
on
stampede
smith
but
alan
neither
smiled
nor
laughed
for
in
his
heart
was
something
very
near
to
the
missing
love
of
brotherhood
for
this
little
man
who
had
written
his
name
across
so
many
pages
of
alaskan
history
this
morning
as
alan
saw
him
stampede
smith
was
no
longer
the
swiftest
gunman
between
white
horse
and
dawson
city
he
was
a
pathetic
reminder
of
the
old
days
when
he
had
run
down
soapy
smith
and
his
gang
days
when
the
going
of
stampede
smith
to
new
fields
meant
a
stampede
behind
him
and
when
his
name
was
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
those
of
george
carmack
and
alex
mcdonald
and
jerome
chute
and
a
hundred
men
like
curley
monroe
and
joe
barret
set
their
compasses
by
his
to
alan
there
was
tragedy
in
his
aloneness
as
he
stood
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
twenty
times
a
millionaire
he
knew
that
stampede
smith
was
broke
again
good
morning
he
said
so
unexpectedly
that
the
little
man
jerked
himself
round
like
the
lash
of
a
whip
a
trick
of
the
old
gun
days
why
so
much
loneliness
stampede
stampede
grinned
wryly
he
had
humorous
blue
eyes
buried
like
an
airedale
under
brows
which
bristled
even
more
fiercely
than
his
whiskers
i
thinkin
said
he
what
a
fool
thing
is
money
good
mornin
alan
he
nodded
and
chuckled
and
continued
to
chuckle
in
the
face
of
the
lifting
fog
and
alan
saw
the
old
humor
which
had
always
been
last
asset
when
in
trouble
he
drew
nearer
and
stood
beside
him
so
that
their
shoulders
touched
as
they
leaned
over
the
rail
alan
said
stampede
it
ai
often
i
have
a
big
thought
but
been
having
one
all
night
ai
forgot
bonanza
have
you
alan
shook
his
head
as
long
as
there
is
an
alaska
we
wo
forget
bonanza
stampede
i
took
a
million
out
of
it
next
to
carmack
discovery
an
went
busted
afterward
did
i
alan
nodded
without
speaking
but
that
was
a
circumstance
to
gold
run
creek
over
the
divide
stampede
continued
ruminatively
ai
forgot
old
aleck
mcdonald
the
scotchman
have
you
alan
in
the
of
we
took
up
seventy
sacks
to
bring
our
gold
back
in
and
we
lacked
thirty
of
the
job
nine
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
a
single
and
that
was
only
the
beginning
well
i
went
busted
again
and
old
aleck
went
busted
later
on
but
he
had
a
pretty
wife
left
a
girl
from
seattle
i
had
to
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
caressing
his
damp
whiskers
as
he
noted
the
first
of
the
sun
breaking
through
the
mist
between
them
and
the
unseen
mountain
tops
five
times
after
that
i
made
strikes
and
went
busted
he
said
a
little
proudly
and
i
busted
again
i
know
it
sympathized
alan
they
took
every
cent
away
from
me
down
in
seattle
an
frisco
chuckled
stampede
rubbing
his
hands
together
cheerfully
an
then
bought
me
a
ticket
to
nome
mighty
fine
of
them
do
you
think
could
have
been
more
decent
i
knew
that
fellow
kopf
had
a
heart
that
why
i
trusted
him
with
my
money
it
was
his
fault
he
lost
it
of
course
not
agreed
alan
and
i
sort
of
sorry
i
shot
him
up
for
it
i
am
for
a
fact
you
killed
him
not
quite
i
clipped
one
ear
off
as
a
reminder
down
in
chink
holleran
place
mighty
sorry
did
think
then
how
decent
it
was
of
him
to
buy
me
a
ticket
to
nome
i
just
let
go
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
he
did
me
a
favor
in
cleanin
me
alan
he
did
so
help
me
you
realize
how
free
an
easy
an
beautiful
everything
is
until
you
busted
smiling
his
odd
face
almost
boyish
behind
its
ambush
of
hair
he
saw
the
grim
look
in
alan
eyes
and
about
his
jaws
he
caught
hold
of
the
other
arm
and
shook
it
alan
i
mean
it
he
declared
that
why
i
think
money
is
a
fool
thing
it
ai
money
that
makes
me
happy
it
it
the
gold
in
the
mountains
that
makes
the
blood
run
fast
through
my
gizzard
after
i
found
it
i
ca
find
any
use
for
it
in
particular
i
want
to
go
broke
if
i
did
i
get
lazy
and
fat
an
some
newfangled
doctor
would
operate
on
me
and
i
die
they
doing
a
lot
of
that
operatin
down
in
frisco
alan
one
day
i
had
a
pain
and
they
wanted
to
cut
out
something
from
inside
me
think
what
can
happen
to
a
man
when
he
got
money
you
mean
all
that
stampede
on
my
life
i
do
i
just
aching
for
the
open
skies
alan
the
mountains
and
the
yellow
stuff
that
going
to
be
my
playmate
till
i
die
somebody
me
in
nome
they
wo
said
alan
suddenly
not
if
i
can
help
it
stampede
i
want
you
i
want
you
with
me
up
under
the
endicott
mountains
i
got
ten
thousand
reindeer
up
there
it
no
man
land
and
we
can
do
as
we
please
in
it
i
not
after
gold
i
want
another
sort
of
thing
but
fancied
the
endicott
ranges
are
full
of
that
yellow
playmate
of
yours
it
a
new
country
you
never
seen
it
god
only
knows
what
you
may
find
will
you
come
the
humorous
twinkle
had
gone
out
of
stampede
eyes
he
was
staring
at
alan
will
i
alan
will
a
cub
nurse
its
mother
try
me
ask
me
say
it
all
over
the
two
men
gripped
hands
smiling
alan
nodded
to
the
east
the
last
of
the
fog
was
clearing
swiftly
the
tips
of
the
cragged
alaskan
ranges
rose
up
against
the
blue
of
a
cloudless
sky
and
the
morning
sun
was
flashing
in
rose
and
gold
at
their
snowy
peaks
stampede
also
nodded
speech
was
unnecessary
they
both
understood
and
the
thrill
of
the
life
they
loved
passed
from
one
to
the
other
in
the
grip
of
their
hands
chapter
v
breakfast
hour
was
half
over
when
alan
went
into
the
there
were
only
two
empty
chairs
at
his
table
one
was
his
own
the
other
belonged
to
mary
standish
there
was
something
almost
aggressively
suggestive
in
their
simultaneous
vacancy
it
struck
him
at
first
he
nodded
as
he
sat
down
a
flash
of
amusement
in
his
eyes
when
he
observed
the
look
in
the
young
engineer
face
it
was
both
envious
and
accusing
and
yet
alan
was
sure
the
young
man
was
unconscious
of
betraying
an
emotion
the
fact
lent
to
the
eating
of
his
grapefruit
an
accompaniment
of
pleasing
and
amusing
thought
he
recalled
the
young
man
name
it
was
tucker
he
was
a
athletic
chap
and
an
idiot
would
have
guessed
the
truth
alan
told
himself
the
young
engineer
was
more
than
casually
interested
in
mary
standish
he
was
in
love
it
was
not
a
discovery
which
alan
made
it
was
a
decision
and
as
soon
as
possible
he
would
remedy
the
unfortunate
omission
of
a
general
introduction
at
their
table
by
bringing
the
two
together
such
an
introduction
would
undoubtedly
relieve
him
of
a
certain
responsibility
which
had
persisted
in
attaching
itself
to
him
so
he
tried
to
think
but
in
spite
of
his
resolution
he
could
not
get
the
empty
chair
opposite
him
out
of
his
mind
it
refused
to
be
obliterated
and
when
other
chairs
became
vacant
as
their
owners
left
the
table
this
one
straight
across
from
him
continued
to
thrust
itself
upon
him
until
this
morning
it
had
been
like
other
empty
chairs
now
it
was
persistently
annoying
inasmuch
as
he
had
no
desire
to
be
so
constantly
reminded
of
last
night
and
the
twelve
tryst
of
mary
standish
with
graham
agent
rossland
he
was
the
last
at
the
table
tucker
remaining
until
his
final
hope
of
seeing
mary
standish
was
gone
rose
with
two
others
the
first
two
had
made
their
exit
through
the
door
leading
from
the
dining
salon
when
the
young
engineer
paused
alan
watching
him
saw
a
sudden
change
in
his
face
in
a
moment
it
was
explained
mary
standish
came
in
she
passed
tucker
without
appearing
to
notice
him
and
gave
alan
a
cool
little
nod
as
she
seated
herself
at
the
table
she
was
very
pale
he
could
see
nothing
of
the
flush
of
color
that
had
been
in
her
cheeks
last
night
as
she
bowed
her
head
a
little
arranging
her
dress
a
pool
of
sunlight
played
in
her
hair
and
alan
was
staring
at
it
when
she
raised
her
eyes
they
were
coolly
beautiful
very
direct
and
without
embarrassment
something
inside
him
challenged
their
loveliness
it
seemed
inconceivable
that
such
eyes
could
play
a
part
in
fraud
and
deception
yet
he
was
in
possession
of
quite
conclusive
proof
of
it
if
they
had
lowered
themselves
an
instant
if
they
had
in
any
way
betrayed
a
shadow
of
regret
he
would
have
found
an
apology
instead
of
that
his
fingers
touched
the
handkerchief
in
his
pocket
did
you
sleep
well
miss
standish
he
asked
politely
not
at
all
she
replied
so
frankly
that
his
conviction
was
a
bit
unsettled
i
tried
to
powder
away
the
dark
rings
under
my
eyes
but
i
am
afraid
i
have
failed
is
that
why
you
ask
he
was
holding
the
handkerchief
in
his
hand
this
is
the
first
morning
i
have
seen
you
at
breakfast
i
accepted
it
for
granted
you
must
have
slept
well
is
this
yours
miss
standish
he
watched
her
face
as
she
took
the
crumpled
bit
of
cambric
from
his
fingers
in
a
moment
she
was
smiling
the
smile
was
not
forced
it
was
the
quick
response
to
a
feminine
instinct
of
pleasure
and
he
was
disappointed
not
to
catch
in
her
face
a
betrayal
of
embarrassment
it
is
my
handkerchief
holt
where
did
you
find
it
in
front
of
my
cabin
door
a
little
after
midnight
he
was
almost
brutal
in
the
definiteness
of
detail
he
expected
some
kind
of
result
but
there
was
none
except
that
the
smile
remained
on
her
lips
a
moment
longer
and
there
was
a
laughing
flash
back
in
the
clear
depths
of
her
eyes
her
level
glance
was
as
innocent
as
a
and
as
he
looked
at
her
he
thought
of
a
child
a
most
beautiful
child
and
so
utterly
did
he
feel
the
discomfiture
of
his
mental
analysis
of
her
that
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
frigid
bow
i
thank
you
holt
she
said
you
can
imagine
my
sense
of
obligation
when
i
tell
you
i
have
only
three
handkerchiefs
aboard
the
ship
with
me
and
this
is
my
favorite
she
busied
herself
with
the
breakfast
card
and
as
alan
left
he
heard
her
give
the
waiter
an
order
for
fruit
and
cereal
his
blood
was
hot
but
the
flush
of
it
did
not
show
in
his
face
he
felt
the
uncomfortable
sensation
of
her
eyes
following
him
as
he
stalked
through
the
door
he
did
not
look
back
something
was
wrong
with
him
and
he
knew
it
this
chit
of
a
girl
with
her
smooth
hair
and
clear
eyes
had
thrown
a
grain
of
dust
into
the
satisfactory
mechanism
of
his
normal
self
and
the
grind
of
it
was
upsetting
certain
specific
formulae
which
made
up
his
life
he
was
a
fool
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
called
himself
names
someone
brushed
against
him
jarring
the
hand
that
held
the
burning
match
he
looked
up
it
was
rossland
the
man
had
a
mere
twist
of
a
smile
on
his
lips
in
his
eyes
was
a
coolly
appraising
look
as
he
nodded
beg
pardon
the
words
were
condescending
carelessly
flung
at
him
over
rossland
shoulder
he
might
as
well
have
said
i
sorry
boy
but
you
must
keep
out
of
my
way
alan
smiled
back
and
returned
the
nod
once
in
a
spirit
of
sauciness
keok
had
told
him
his
eyes
were
like
purring
cats
when
he
was
in
a
humor
to
kill
they
were
like
that
now
as
they
flashed
their
smile
at
rossland
the
sneering
twist
left
rossland
lips
as
he
entered
the
a
rather
obvious
prearrangement
between
mary
standish
and
john
agent
alan
thought
there
were
not
half
a
dozen
people
left
at
the
tables
and
the
scheme
was
that
rossland
should
be
served
with
miss
standish
of
course
that
apparently
was
why
she
had
greeted
him
with
such
cool
civility
her
anxiety
for
him
to
leave
the
table
before
rossland
appeared
upon
the
scene
was
evident
now
that
he
understood
the
situation
he
puffed
at
his
cigar
rossland
interference
had
spoiled
a
perfect
lighting
of
it
and
he
struck
another
match
this
time
he
was
successful
and
he
was
about
to
extinguish
the
burning
end
when
he
hesitated
and
held
it
until
the
fire
touched
his
flesh
mary
standish
was
coming
through
the
door
amazed
by
the
suddenness
of
her
appearance
he
made
no
movement
except
to
drop
the
match
her
eyes
were
flaming
and
two
vivid
spots
burned
in
her
cheeks
she
saw
him
and
gave
the
slightest
inclination
to
her
head
as
she
passed
when
she
had
gone
he
could
not
resist
looking
into
the
salon
as
he
expected
rossland
was
seated
in
a
chair
next
to
the
one
she
had
occupied
and
was
calmly
engaged
in
looking
over
the
breakfast
card
all
this
was
rather
interesting
alan
conceded
if
one
liked
puzzles
personally
he
had
no
desire
to
become
an
answerer
of
conundrums
and
he
was
a
little
ashamed
of
the
curiosity
that
had
urged
him
to
look
in
upon
rossland
at
the
same
time
he
was
mildly
elated
at
the
freezing
reception
which
miss
standish
had
evidently
given
to
the
dislikable
individual
who
had
jostled
him
in
passing
he
went
on
deck
the
sun
was
pouring
in
an
iridescent
splendor
over
the
snowy
peaks
of
the
mountains
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
almost
reach
out
his
arms
and
touch
them
the
appeared
to
be
drifting
in
the
heart
of
a
paradise
of
mountains
eastward
very
near
was
the
mainland
so
close
on
the
other
hand
that
he
could
hear
the
shout
of
a
man
was
douglas
island
and
ahead
reaching
out
like
a
ribbon
was
gastineau
channel
the
mining
towns
of
treadwell
and
douglas
were
in
sight
someone
nudged
him
and
he
found
stampede
smith
at
his
side
that
bill
treadwell
place
he
said
once
the
richest
gold
mines
in
alaska
they
flooded
now
i
knew
bill
when
he
was
worrying
about
the
price
of
a
pair
of
boots
had
to
buy
a
pair
an
patched
himself
then
he
struck
it
lucky
got
four
hundred
dollars
somewhere
and
bought
some
claims
over
there
from
a
man
named
french
pete
they
called
it
glory
hole
an
there
was
a
time
when
there
were
nine
hundred
stamps
at
work
take
a
look
alan
it
worth
it
somehow
stampede
voice
and
information
lacked
appeal
the
decks
were
crowded
with
passengers
as
the
ship
picked
her
way
into
juneau
and
alan
wandered
among
them
with
a
gathering
sense
of
disillusionment
pressing
upon
him
he
knew
that
he
was
looking
with
more
than
casual
interest
for
mary
standish
and
he
was
glad
when
stampede
bumped
into
an
old
acquaintance
and
permitted
him
to
be
alone
he
was
not
pleased
with
the
discovery
and
yet
he
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
it
the
grain
of
dust
had
become
more
than
annoying
it
did
not
wear
away
as
he
had
supposed
it
would
but
was
becoming
an
obsessive
factor
in
his
thoughts
and
the
it
built
up
in
him
while
aggravatingly
persistent
was
less
disturbing
than
before
the
little
drama
in
the
had
had
its
effect
upon
him
in
spite
of
himself
he
liked
fighters
and
mary
standish
intensely
feminine
in
her
quiet
prettiness
had
shown
her
mettle
in
those
few
moments
when
he
had
seen
her
flashing
eyes
and
blazing
cheeks
after
leaving
rossland
he
began
to
look
for
rossland
too
he
was
in
a
humor
to
meet
him
not
until
juneau
hung
before
him
in
all
its
picturesque
beauty
literally
terraced
against
the
green
sweep
of
mount
juneau
did
he
go
down
to
the
lower
deck
the
few
passengers
ready
to
leave
the
ship
gathered
near
the
gangway
with
their
luggage
alan
was
about
to
pass
them
when
he
suddenly
stopped
a
short
distance
from
him
where
he
could
see
every
person
who
disembarked
stood
rossland
there
was
something
grimly
unpleasant
in
his
attitude
as
he
fumbled
his
and
eyed
the
stair
from
above
his
watchfulness
sent
an
unexpected
thrill
through
alan
like
a
shot
his
mind
jumped
to
a
conclusion
he
stepped
to
rossland
side
and
touched
his
arm
watching
for
miss
standish
he
asked
i
am
there
was
no
evasion
in
rossland
words
they
possessed
the
hard
and
definite
quality
of
one
who
had
an
incontestable
authority
behind
him
and
if
she
goes
ashore
i
am
going
too
is
it
any
affair
of
yours
holt
has
she
asked
you
to
discuss
the
matter
with
me
if
so
no
miss
standish
has
done
that
then
please
attend
to
your
own
business
if
you
have
enough
to
take
up
your
time
i
lend
you
some
books
i
have
several
in
my
cabin
without
waiting
for
an
answer
rossland
coolly
moved
away
alan
did
not
follow
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
resent
nothing
for
him
to
imprecate
but
his
own
folly
rossland
words
were
not
an
insult
they
were
truth
he
had
deliberately
intruded
in
an
affair
which
was
undoubtedly
of
a
highly
private
nature
possibly
it
was
a
domestic
tangle
he
shuddered
a
sense
of
humiliation
swept
over
him
and
he
was
glad
that
rossland
did
not
even
look
back
at
him
he
tried
to
whistle
as
he
climbed
back
to
the
rossland
even
though
he
detested
the
man
had
set
him
right
and
he
would
lend
him
books
if
he
wanted
to
be
amused
egad
but
the
fellow
had
turned
the
trick
nicely
and
it
was
something
to
be
remembered
he
stiffened
his
shoulders
and
found
old
donald
hardwick
and
stampede
smith
he
did
not
leave
them
until
the
had
landed
her
passengers
and
freight
and
was
churning
her
way
out
of
gastineau
channel
toward
skagway
then
he
went
to
the
and
remained
there
until
luncheon
hour
today
mary
standish
was
ahead
of
him
at
the
table
she
was
seated
with
her
back
toward
him
as
he
entered
so
she
did
not
see
him
as
he
came
up
behind
her
so
near
that
his
coat
brushed
her
chair
he
looked
across
at
her
and
smiled
as
he
seated
himself
she
returned
the
smile
but
it
seemed
to
him
an
apologetic
little
effort
she
did
not
look
well
and
her
presence
at
the
table
struck
him
as
being
a
brave
front
to
hide
something
from
someone
casually
he
looked
over
his
left
shoulder
rossland
was
there
in
his
seat
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
indirect
as
his
glance
had
been
alan
saw
the
girl
understood
the
significance
of
it
she
bowed
her
head
a
little
and
her
long
lashes
shaded
her
eyes
for
a
moment
he
wondered
why
he
always
looked
at
her
hair
first
it
had
a
peculiarly
pleasing
effect
on
him
he
had
been
observant
enough
to
know
that
she
had
rearranged
it
since
breakfast
and
the
smooth
coils
twisted
in
mysterious
intricacy
at
the
crown
of
her
head
were
like
softly
glowing
velvet
the
ridiculous
thought
came
to
him
that
he
would
like
to
see
them
tumbling
down
about
her
they
must
be
even
more
beautiful
when
freed
from
their
bondage
the
pallor
of
her
face
was
unusual
possibly
it
was
the
way
the
light
fell
upon
her
through
the
window
but
when
she
looked
across
at
him
again
he
caught
for
an
instant
the
tiniest
quiver
about
her
mouth
he
began
telling
her
something
about
skagway
quite
carelessly
as
if
he
had
seen
nothing
which
she
might
want
to
conceal
the
light
in
her
eyes
changed
and
it
was
almost
a
glow
of
gratitude
he
caught
in
them
he
had
broken
a
tension
relieved
her
of
some
unaccountable
strain
she
was
under
he
noticed
that
her
ordering
of
food
was
merely
a
pretense
she
scarcely
touched
it
and
yet
he
was
sure
no
other
person
at
the
table
had
discovered
the
insincerity
of
her
effort
not
even
tucker
the
enamored
engineer
it
was
likely
tucker
placed
a
delicate
halo
about
her
lack
of
appetite
accepting
daintiness
of
that
sort
as
an
angelic
virtue
only
alan
sitting
opposite
her
guessed
the
truth
she
was
making
a
splendid
effort
but
he
felt
that
every
nerve
in
her
body
was
at
the
when
she
arose
from
her
seat
he
thrust
back
his
own
chair
at
the
same
time
he
saw
rossland
get
up
and
advance
rather
hurriedly
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
the
girl
passed
through
the
door
first
rossland
followed
a
dozen
steps
behind
and
alan
came
last
almost
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
tucker
it
was
amusing
in
a
way
yet
beyond
the
humor
of
it
was
something
that
drew
a
grim
line
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
at
the
foot
of
the
luxuriously
carpeted
stair
leading
from
the
dining
salon
to
the
main
deck
miss
standish
suddenly
stopped
and
turned
upon
rossland
for
only
an
instant
her
eyes
were
leveled
at
him
then
they
flashed
past
him
and
with
a
swift
movement
she
came
toward
alan
a
flush
had
leaped
into
her
cheeks
but
there
was
no
excitement
in
her
voice
when
she
spoke
yet
it
was
distinct
and
clearly
heard
by
rossland
i
understand
we
are
approaching
skagway
holt
she
said
will
you
take
me
on
deck
and
tell
me
about
it
graham
agent
had
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
and
was
slowly
preparing
to
light
a
cigarette
recalling
his
humiliation
of
a
few
hours
before
at
juneau
when
the
other
had
very
clearly
proved
him
a
meddler
words
refused
to
form
quickly
on
alan
lips
before
he
was
ready
with
an
answer
mary
standish
had
confidently
taken
his
arm
he
could
see
the
red
flush
deepening
in
her
upturned
face
she
was
amazingly
unexpected
bewilderingly
pretty
and
as
cool
as
ice
except
for
the
softly
glowing
fire
in
her
cheeks
he
saw
rossland
staring
with
his
cigarette
half
poised
it
was
instinctive
for
him
to
smile
in
the
face
of
danger
and
he
smiled
now
without
speaking
the
girl
laughed
softly
she
gave
his
arm
a
gentle
tug
and
he
found
himself
moving
past
rossland
amazed
but
obedient
her
eyes
looking
at
him
in
a
way
that
sent
a
gentle
thrill
through
him
at
the
head
of
the
wide
stair
she
whispered
with
her
lips
close
to
his
shoulder
you
are
splendid
i
thank
you
mr
holt
her
words
along
with
the
decisive
relaxing
of
her
hand
upon
his
arm
were
like
a
dash
of
cold
water
in
his
face
rossland
could
no
longer
see
them
unless
he
had
followed
the
girl
had
played
her
part
and
a
second
time
he
had
accepted
the
role
of
a
fool
but
the
thought
did
not
anger
him
there
was
a
remarkable
element
of
humor
about
it
for
him
viewing
himself
in
the
matter
and
mary
standish
heard
him
chuckling
as
they
came
out
on
deck
her
fingers
tightened
resentfully
upon
his
arm
it
is
funny
she
reproved
it
is
tragic
to
be
bored
by
a
man
like
that
he
knew
she
was
politely
lying
to
anticipate
the
question
he
might
ask
and
he
wondered
what
would
happen
if
he
embarrassed
her
by
letting
her
know
he
had
seen
her
alone
with
rossland
at
midnight
he
looked
down
at
her
and
she
met
his
scrutiny
unflinchingly
she
even
smiled
at
him
and
her
eyes
he
thought
were
the
loveliest
liars
he
had
ever
looked
into
he
felt
the
stir
of
an
unusual
sentiment
a
sort
of
pride
in
her
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
say
nothing
about
rossland
he
was
still
absurdly
convinced
that
he
had
not
the
smallest
interest
in
affairs
which
were
not
entirely
his
own
mary
standish
evidently
believed
he
was
blind
and
he
would
make
no
effort
to
spoil
her
illusion
such
a
course
would
undoubtedly
be
most
satisfactory
in
the
end
even
now
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
incident
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
a
softer
light
was
in
her
eyes
when
they
came
to
the
bow
of
the
ship
and
alan
fancied
he
heard
a
strange
little
cry
on
her
lips
as
she
looked
about
her
upon
the
paradise
of
taiya
inlet
straight
ahead
like
a
lilac
ribbon
ran
the
narrow
waterway
to
skagway
door
while
on
both
sides
rose
high
mountains
covered
with
green
forests
to
the
snowy
crests
that
gleamed
like
white
blankets
near
the
clouds
in
this
melting
season
there
came
to
them
above
the
slow
throb
of
the
ship
engines
the
liquid
music
of
innumerable
cascades
and
from
a
mountain
that
seemed
to
float
almost
directly
over
their
heads
fell
a
stream
of
water
a
sheer
thousand
feet
to
the
sea
smoking
and
twisting
in
the
sunshine
like
a
living
thing
at
play
and
then
a
miracle
happened
which
even
alan
wondered
at
for
the
ship
seemed
to
stand
still
and
the
mountain
to
swing
slowly
as
if
some
unseen
and
mighty
force
were
opening
a
guarded
door
and
green
foothills
with
glistening
white
cottages
floated
into
the
picture
and
skagway
heart
of
romance
monument
to
brave
men
and
thrilling
deeds
drifted
out
slowly
from
its
alan
turned
to
speak
but
what
he
saw
in
the
girl
face
held
him
silent
her
lips
were
parted
and
she
was
staring
as
if
an
unexpected
thing
had
risen
before
her
eyes
something
that
bewildered
her
and
even
startled
her
and
then
as
if
speaking
to
herself
and
not
to
alan
holt
she
said
in
a
tense
whisper
i
have
seen
this
place
before
it
was
a
long
time
ago
maybe
it
was
a
hundred
years
or
a
thousand
but
i
have
been
here
i
have
lived
under
that
mountain
with
the
waterfall
creeping
down
it
a
tremor
ran
through
her
and
she
remembered
alan
she
looked
up
at
him
and
he
was
puzzled
a
weirdly
beautiful
mystery
lay
in
her
eyes
i
must
go
ashore
here
she
said
i
did
know
i
would
find
it
so
soon
please
with
her
hand
touching
his
arm
she
turned
he
was
looking
at
her
and
saw
the
strange
light
fade
swiftly
out
of
her
eyes
following
her
glance
he
saw
rossland
standing
half
a
dozen
paces
behind
them
in
another
moment
mary
standish
was
facing
the
sea
and
again
her
hand
was
resting
confidently
in
the
crook
of
alan
arm
did
you
ever
feel
like
killing
a
man
mr
holt
she
asked
with
an
icy
little
laugh
yes
he
answered
rather
unexpectedly
and
some
day
if
the
right
opportunity
comes
i
am
going
to
kill
a
certain
man
the
man
who
murdered
my
father
she
gave
a
little
gasp
of
horror
your
father
was
murdered
indirectly
yes
it
was
done
with
knife
or
gun
miss
standish
money
was
the
weapon
somebody
money
and
john
graham
was
the
man
who
struck
the
blow
some
day
if
there
is
justice
i
shall
kill
him
and
right
now
if
you
will
allow
me
to
demand
an
explanation
of
this
man
rossland
her
hand
tightened
on
his
arm
then
slowly
she
drew
it
away
i
do
want
you
to
ask
an
explanation
of
him
she
said
if
he
should
make
it
you
would
hate
me
tell
me
about
skagway
holt
that
will
be
pleasanter
chapter
vi
not
until
early
twilight
came
with
the
deep
shadows
of
the
western
mountains
and
the
was
churning
slowly
back
through
the
narrow
to
the
open
pacific
did
the
significance
of
that
afternoon
fully
impress
itself
upon
alan
for
hours
he
had
surrendered
himself
to
an
impulse
which
he
could
not
understand
and
which
in
ordinary
moments
he
would
not
have
excused
he
had
taken
mary
standish
ashore
for
two
hours
she
had
walked
at
his
side
asking
him
questions
and
listening
to
him
as
no
other
had
ever
questioned
him
or
listened
to
him
before
he
had
shown
her
skagway
between
the
mountains
he
pictured
the
cañon
where
skagway
grew
from
one
tent
to
hundreds
in
a
day
from
hundreds
to
thousands
in
a
week
he
visioned
for
her
the
old
days
of
romance
adventure
and
death
he
told
her
of
soapy
smith
and
his
gang
of
outlaws
and
side
by
side
they
stood
over
soapy
sunken
grave
as
the
first
somber
shadows
of
the
mountains
grew
upon
them
but
among
it
all
and
through
it
all
she
had
asked
him
about
and
he
had
responded
until
now
he
did
not
realize
how
much
he
had
confided
in
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
very
soul
of
this
slim
and
beautiful
girl
who
had
walked
at
his
side
had
urged
him
on
to
the
indiscretion
of
personal
confidence
he
had
seemed
to
feel
her
heart
beating
with
his
own
as
he
described
his
beloved
land
under
the
endicott
mountains
with
its
vast
tundras
his
herds
and
his
people
there
he
had
told
her
a
new
world
was
in
the
making
and
the
glow
in
her
eyes
and
the
thrilling
something
in
her
voice
had
urged
him
on
until
he
forgot
that
rossland
was
waiting
at
the
ship
gangway
to
see
when
they
returned
he
had
built
up
for
her
his
castles
in
the
air
and
the
miracle
of
it
was
that
she
had
helped
him
to
build
them
he
had
described
for
her
the
change
that
was
creeping
slowly
over
alaska
the
replacement
of
mountain
trails
by
stage
and
automobile
highways
the
building
of
railroads
the
growth
of
cities
where
tents
had
stood
a
few
years
before
it
was
then
when
he
had
pictured
progress
and
civilization
and
the
breaking
down
of
nature
last
barriers
before
science
and
invention
that
he
had
seen
a
cloud
of
doubt
in
her
gray
eyes
and
now
as
they
stood
on
the
deck
of
the
looking
at
the
white
peaks
of
the
mountains
dissolving
into
the
lavender
mist
of
twilight
doubt
and
perplexity
were
still
deeper
in
her
eyes
and
she
said
i
would
always
love
tents
and
old
trails
and
nature
barriers
i
envy
belinda
mulrooney
whom
you
told
me
about
this
afternoon
i
hate
cities
and
railroads
and
automobiles
and
all
that
goes
with
them
and
i
am
sorry
to
see
those
things
come
to
alaska
and
i
too
hate
this
man
john
graham
her
words
startled
him
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
he
is
doing
with
his
money
now
her
voice
was
cold
and
one
little
hand
he
noticed
was
clenched
at
the
edge
of
the
rail
he
has
stripped
alaskan
waters
of
fish
resources
which
will
never
be
replaced
miss
standish
but
that
is
not
all
i
believe
i
state
the
case
well
within
fact
when
i
say
he
has
killed
many
women
and
little
children
by
robbing
the
inland
waters
of
the
food
supplies
upon
which
the
natives
have
subsisted
for
centuries
i
know
i
have
seen
them
die
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
swayed
against
him
for
an
instant
and
that
is
all
he
laughed
grimly
possibly
some
people
would
think
it
enough
miss
standish
but
the
tentacles
of
his
power
are
reaching
everywhere
in
alaska
his
agents
swarm
throughout
the
territory
and
soapy
smith
was
a
gentleman
outlaw
compared
with
these
men
and
their
master
if
men
like
john
graham
are
allowed
to
have
their
way
in
ten
years
greed
and
graft
will
despoil
what
two
hundred
years
of
rooseveltian
conservation
would
not
be
able
to
replace
she
raised
her
head
and
in
the
dusk
her
pale
face
looked
up
at
the
of
the
mountains
still
visible
through
the
thickening
gloom
of
evening
i
am
glad
you
told
me
about
belinda
mulrooney
she
said
i
am
beginning
to
understand
and
it
gives
me
courage
to
think
of
a
woman
like
her
she
could
fight
could
she
she
could
make
a
man
fight
yes
and
did
make
it
and
she
had
no
money
to
give
her
power
her
last
dollar
you
told
me
she
flung
into
the
yukon
for
luck
yes
at
dawson
it
was
the
one
thing
between
her
and
hunger
she
raised
her
hand
and
on
it
he
saw
gleaming
faintly
the
single
ring
which
she
wore
slowly
she
drew
it
from
her
finger
then
this
too
for
luck
the
luck
of
mary
standish
she
laughed
softly
and
flung
the
ring
into
the
sea
she
faced
him
as
if
expecting
the
necessity
of
defending
what
she
had
done
it
is
melodrama
she
said
i
mean
it
and
i
believe
in
it
i
want
something
of
mine
to
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
in
this
gateway
to
skagway
just
as
belinda
mulrooney
wanted
her
dollar
to
rest
forever
at
the
bottom
of
the
yukon
she
gave
him
the
hand
from
which
she
had
taken
the
ring
and
for
a
moment
the
warm
thrill
of
it
lay
in
his
own
thank
you
for
the
wonderful
afternoon
you
have
given
me
holt
i
shall
never
forget
it
it
is
dinner
time
i
must
say
good
night
he
followed
her
slim
figure
with
his
eyes
until
she
disappeared
in
returning
to
his
cabin
he
almost
bumped
into
rossland
the
incident
was
irritating
neither
of
the
men
spoke
or
nodded
but
rossland
met
look
squarely
his
face
in
its
repression
of
emotion
impression
of
the
man
was
changing
in
spite
of
his
prejudice
there
was
a
growing
something
about
him
which
commanded
attention
a
certainty
of
poise
which
could
not
be
mistaken
for
sham
a
scoundrel
he
might
be
but
a
cool
brain
was
at
work
inside
his
head
a
brain
not
easily
disturbed
by
unimportant
things
he
decided
he
disliked
the
man
as
an
agent
of
john
graham
alan
looked
upon
him
as
an
enemy
and
as
an
acquaintance
of
mary
standish
he
was
as
much
of
a
mystery
as
the
girl
herself
and
only
now
in
his
cabin
was
alan
beginning
to
sense
the
presence
of
a
real
authority
behind
rossland
attitude
he
was
not
curious
all
his
life
he
had
lived
too
near
the
raw
edge
of
practical
things
to
dissipate
in
gossipy
conjecture
he
cared
nothing
about
the
relationship
between
mary
standish
and
rossland
except
as
it
involved
himself
and
the
situation
had
become
a
trifle
too
delicate
to
please
him
he
could
see
no
sport
in
an
adventure
of
the
kind
it
suggested
and
the
possibility
that
he
had
been
misjudged
by
both
rossland
and
mary
standish
sent
a
flush
of
anger
into
his
cheeks
he
cared
nothing
for
rossland
except
that
he
would
like
to
wipe
him
out
of
existence
with
all
other
graham
agents
and
he
persisted
in
the
conviction
that
he
thought
of
the
girl
only
in
a
most
casual
sort
of
way
he
had
made
no
effort
to
discover
her
history
he
had
not
questioned
her
at
no
time
had
he
intimated
a
desire
to
intrude
upon
her
personal
affairs
and
at
no
time
had
she
offered
information
about
herself
or
an
explanation
of
the
singular
espionage
which
rossland
had
presumed
to
take
upon
himself
he
grimaced
as
he
reflected
how
dangerously
near
that
hazard
he
had
been
and
he
admired
her
for
the
splendid
judgment
she
had
shown
in
the
matter
she
had
saved
him
the
possible
alternative
of
apologizing
to
rossland
or
throwing
him
overboard
there
was
a
certain
bellicose
twist
to
his
mind
as
he
went
down
to
the
dining
salon
an
obstinate
determination
to
hold
himself
aloof
from
any
increasing
intimacy
with
mary
standish
no
matter
how
pleasing
his
experience
had
been
he
resented
the
idea
of
being
commandeered
at
unexpected
moments
had
mary
standish
read
his
thoughts
her
bearing
toward
him
during
the
dinner
hour
could
not
have
been
more
satisfying
there
was
in
a
way
something
seductively
provocative
about
it
she
greeted
him
with
the
slightest
inclination
of
her
head
and
a
cool
little
smile
her
attitude
did
not
invite
spoken
words
either
from
him
or
from
his
neighbors
yet
no
one
would
have
accused
her
of
deliberate
reserve
her
demure
unapproachableness
was
a
growing
revelation
to
him
and
he
found
himself
interested
in
spite
of
the
new
law
of
he
had
set
down
for
himself
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
from
stealing
glimpses
at
her
hair
when
her
head
was
bowed
a
little
she
had
smoothed
it
tonight
until
it
was
like
softest
velvet
with
rich
glints
in
it
and
the
amazing
thought
came
to
him
that
it
would
be
sweetly
pleasant
to
touch
with
one
hand
the
discovery
was
almost
a
shock
keok
and
nawadlook
had
beautiful
hair
but
he
had
never
thought
of
it
in
this
way
and
he
had
never
thought
of
keok
pretty
mouth
as
he
was
thinking
of
the
girl
opposite
him
he
shifted
uneasily
and
was
glad
mary
standish
did
not
look
at
him
in
these
moments
of
mental
unbalance
when
he
left
the
table
the
girl
scarcely
noticed
his
going
it
was
as
if
she
had
used
him
and
then
calmly
shuttled
him
out
of
the
way
he
tried
to
laugh
as
he
hunted
up
stampede
smith
he
found
him
half
an
hour
later
feeding
a
captive
bear
on
the
lower
deck
it
was
odd
he
thought
that
a
captive
bear
should
be
going
north
stampede
explained
the
animal
was
a
pet
and
belonged
to
the
thlinkit
indians
there
were
seven
getting
off
at
cordova
alan
observed
that
the
two
girls
watched
him
closely
and
whispered
together
they
were
very
pretty
with
large
dark
eyes
and
pink
in
their
cheeks
one
of
the
men
did
not
look
at
him
at
all
but
sat
on
the
deck
with
his
face
turned
away
with
stampede
he
went
to
the
and
until
a
late
hour
they
discussed
the
big
range
up
under
the
endicott
mountains
and
plans
for
the
future
once
early
in
the
evening
alan
went
to
his
cabin
to
get
maps
and
photographs
stampede
eyes
glistened
as
his
mind
seized
upon
the
possibilities
of
the
new
adventure
it
was
a
vast
land
an
unknown
country
and
alan
was
its
first
pioneer
the
old
thrill
ran
in
stampede
blood
and
its
infectiousness
caught
alan
so
that
he
forgot
mary
standish
and
all
else
but
the
miles
that
lay
between
them
and
the
mighty
tundras
beyond
the
seward
peninsula
it
was
midnight
when
alan
went
to
his
cabin
he
was
happy
love
of
life
swept
in
an
irresistible
surge
through
his
body
and
he
breathed
in
deeply
of
the
soft
sea
air
that
came
in
through
his
open
port
from
the
west
in
stampede
smith
he
had
at
last
found
the
comradeship
which
he
had
missed
and
the
responsive
note
to
the
wild
and
desires
always
smoldering
in
his
heart
he
looked
out
at
the
stars
and
smiled
up
at
them
and
his
soul
was
filled
with
an
unspoken
thankfulness
that
he
was
not
born
too
late
another
generation
and
there
would
be
no
last
frontier
years
more
and
the
world
would
lie
utterly
in
the
shackles
of
science
and
invention
and
what
the
human
race
called
progress
so
god
had
been
good
to
him
he
was
helping
to
write
the
last
page
in
that
history
which
would
go
down
through
the
eons
of
time
written
in
the
red
blood
of
men
who
had
cut
the
first
trails
into
the
unknown
after
him
there
would
be
no
more
frontiers
no
more
mysteries
of
unknown
lands
to
solve
no
more
pioneering
hazards
to
make
the
earth
would
be
tamed
and
suddenly
he
thought
of
mary
standish
and
of
what
she
had
said
to
him
in
the
dusk
of
evening
strange
that
it
had
been
thought
too
that
she
would
always
love
tents
and
old
trails
and
nature
barriers
and
hated
to
see
cities
and
railroads
and
automobiles
come
to
alaska
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
probably
she
had
guessed
what
was
in
his
own
mind
for
she
was
clever
very
clever
a
tap
at
his
door
drew
his
eyes
from
the
open
watch
in
his
hand
it
was
a
quarter
after
twelve
an
unusual
hour
for
someone
to
be
tapping
at
his
door
it
was
repeated
a
bit
hesitatingly
he
thought
then
it
came
again
quick
and
decisive
replacing
his
watch
in
his
pocket
he
opened
the
door
it
was
mary
standish
who
stood
facing
him
he
saw
only
her
eyes
at
first
strange
frightened
eyes
and
then
he
saw
the
pallor
of
her
face
as
she
came
slowly
in
without
waiting
for
him
to
speak
or
give
her
permission
to
enter
and
it
was
mary
standish
herself
who
closed
the
door
while
he
stared
at
her
in
stupid
wonderment
and
stood
there
with
her
back
against
it
straight
and
slim
and
deathly
pale
may
i
come
in
she
asked
my
god
you
in
gasped
alan
chapter
vii
that
it
was
past
midnight
and
mary
standish
had
deliberately
come
to
his
room
entering
it
and
closing
the
door
without
a
word
or
a
nod
of
invitation
from
him
seemed
incredible
to
alan
after
his
first
explosion
of
astonishment
he
stood
mute
while
the
girl
looked
at
him
steadily
and
her
breath
came
a
little
quickly
but
she
was
not
excited
even
in
his
amazement
he
could
see
that
what
he
had
thought
was
fright
had
gone
out
of
her
eyes
but
he
had
never
seen
her
so
white
and
never
had
she
appeared
quite
so
slim
and
as
while
she
stood
there
in
these
astounding
moments
with
her
back
against
the
door
the
pallor
of
her
face
accentuated
the
rich
darkness
of
her
hair
even
her
lips
were
pale
but
she
was
not
embarrassed
her
eyes
were
clear
and
unafraid
now
and
in
the
poise
of
her
head
and
body
was
a
sureness
of
purpose
that
staggered
him
a
feeling
of
anger
almost
of
personal
resentment
began
to
possess
him
as
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
this
at
last
was
the
cost
of
his
courtesies
to
her
the
advantage
she
was
taking
of
him
was
an
indignity
and
an
outrage
and
his
mind
flashed
to
the
suspicion
that
rossland
was
standing
just
outside
the
door
in
another
moment
he
would
have
brushed
her
aside
and
opened
it
but
her
quiet
face
held
him
the
tenseness
was
fading
out
of
it
he
saw
her
lips
tremble
and
then
a
miracle
happened
in
her
beautiful
eyes
tears
were
gathering
even
then
she
did
not
lower
her
glance
or
bury
her
face
in
her
hands
but
looked
at
him
bravely
while
the
glistened
like
diamonds
on
her
cheeks
he
felt
his
heart
give
way
she
read
his
thoughts
had
guessed
his
suspicion
and
he
was
wrong
you
you
will
have
a
seat
miss
standish
he
asked
lamely
inclining
his
head
toward
the
cabin
chair
no
please
let
me
stand
she
drew
in
a
deep
breath
it
is
late
mr
holt
rather
an
irregular
hour
for
a
visit
such
as
this
he
assured
her
half
an
hour
after
midnight
to
be
exact
it
must
be
very
important
business
that
has
urged
you
to
make
such
a
hazard
aboard
ship
miss
standish
for
a
moment
she
did
not
answer
him
and
he
saw
the
little
in
her
white
throat
would
belinda
mulrooney
have
considered
this
a
very
great
hazard
holt
in
a
matter
of
life
and
death
do
you
not
think
she
would
have
come
to
your
cabin
at
midnight
even
aboard
ship
and
it
is
that
with
me
a
matter
of
life
and
death
less
than
an
hour
ago
i
came
to
that
decision
i
could
not
wait
until
morning
i
had
to
see
you
tonight
and
why
me
he
asked
why
not
rossland
or
captain
rifle
or
some
other
is
it
because
he
did
not
finish
he
saw
the
shadow
of
something
gather
in
her
eyes
as
if
for
an
instant
she
had
felt
a
stab
of
humiliation
or
of
pain
but
it
was
gone
as
quickly
as
it
came
and
very
quietly
almost
without
emotion
she
answered
him
i
know
how
you
feel
i
have
tried
to
place
myself
in
your
position
it
is
all
very
irregular
as
you
say
but
i
am
not
ashamed
i
have
come
to
you
as
i
would
want
anyone
to
come
to
me
under
similar
circumstances
if
i
were
a
man
if
watching
you
thinking
about
you
making
up
my
mind
about
you
is
taking
an
advantage
then
i
have
been
unfair
holt
but
i
am
not
sorry
i
trust
you
i
know
you
will
believe
me
good
until
i
am
proved
bad
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
help
me
would
you
make
it
possible
for
another
human
being
to
avert
a
great
tragedy
if
you
found
it
in
your
power
to
do
so
he
felt
his
sense
of
judgment
wavering
had
he
been
coolly
analyzing
such
a
situation
in
the
detached
environment
of
the
he
would
have
called
any
man
a
fool
who
hesitated
to
open
his
cabin
door
and
show
his
visitor
out
but
such
a
thought
did
not
occur
to
him
now
he
was
thinking
of
the
handkerchief
he
had
found
the
preceding
midnight
twice
she
had
come
to
his
cabin
at
a
late
hour
it
would
be
my
inclination
to
make
such
a
thing
possible
he
said
answering
her
question
tragedy
is
a
nasty
thing
she
caught
the
hint
of
irony
in
his
voice
if
anything
it
added
to
her
calmness
he
was
to
suffer
no
weeping
entreaties
no
feminine
play
of
helplessness
and
beauty
her
pretty
mouth
was
a
little
firmer
and
the
tilt
of
her
dainty
chin
a
bit
higher
of
course
i
ca
pay
you
she
said
you
are
the
sort
of
man
who
would
resent
an
offer
of
payment
for
what
i
am
about
to
ask
you
to
do
but
i
must
have
help
if
i
do
have
it
and
quickly
she
shuddered
slightly
and
tried
to
smile
something
very
unpleasant
will
happen
holt
she
finished
if
you
will
permit
me
to
take
you
to
captain
rifle
no
captain
rifle
would
question
me
he
would
demand
explanations
you
will
understand
when
i
tell
you
what
i
want
and
i
will
do
that
if
i
may
have
your
word
of
honor
to
hold
in
confidence
what
i
tell
you
whether
you
help
me
or
not
will
you
give
me
that
pledge
yes
if
such
a
pledge
will
relieve
your
mind
miss
standish
he
was
almost
brutally
incurious
as
he
reached
for
a
cigar
he
did
not
see
the
sudden
movement
she
made
as
if
about
to
fly
from
his
room
or
the
quicker
throb
that
came
in
her
throat
when
he
turned
a
faint
flush
was
gathering
in
her
cheeks
i
want
to
leave
the
ship
she
said
the
simplicity
of
her
desire
held
him
silent
and
i
must
leave
it
tonight
or
tomorrow
night
before
we
reach
cordova
is
that
your
problem
he
demanded
astonished
no
i
must
leave
it
in
such
a
way
that
the
world
will
believe
i
am
dead
i
can
not
reach
cordova
alive
at
last
she
struck
home
and
he
stared
at
her
wondering
if
she
were
insane
her
quiet
beautiful
eyes
met
his
own
with
unflinching
steadiness
his
brain
all
at
once
was
crowded
with
questioning
but
no
word
of
it
came
to
his
lips
you
can
help
me
he
heard
her
saying
in
the
same
quiet
calm
voice
softened
so
that
one
could
not
have
heard
it
beyond
the
cabin
door
i
have
a
plan
but
i
know
you
can
arrange
one
if
you
will
it
must
appear
to
be
an
accident
i
must
disappear
fall
overboard
anything
just
so
the
world
will
believe
i
am
dead
it
is
necessary
and
i
can
not
tell
you
why
i
can
not
oh
i
a
note
of
passion
crept
into
her
voice
but
it
was
gone
in
an
instant
leaving
it
cold
and
steady
again
a
second
time
she
tried
to
smile
he
could
see
courage
and
a
bit
of
defiance
shining
in
her
eyes
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
holt
you
are
asking
yourself
if
i
am
mad
if
i
am
a
criminal
what
my
reason
can
be
and
why
i
have
gone
to
rossland
or
captain
rifle
or
some
one
else
and
the
only
answer
i
can
make
is
that
i
have
come
to
you
because
you
are
the
only
man
in
the
world
in
this
hour
that
i
have
faith
in
some
day
you
will
understand
if
you
help
me
if
you
do
not
care
to
help
me
she
stopped
and
he
made
a
gesture
yes
if
i
do
what
will
happen
then
i
shall
be
forced
to
the
inevitable
she
said
it
is
rather
unusual
is
it
to
be
asking
for
one
life
but
that
is
what
i
mean
i
afraid
i
do
quite
understand
is
it
clear
holt
i
do
like
to
appear
spectacular
and
i
do
want
you
to
think
of
me
as
theatrical
even
now
i
hate
that
sort
of
thing
you
must
simply
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
reach
cordova
alive
if
you
do
not
help
me
to
disappear
help
me
to
live
and
at
the
same
time
give
all
others
the
impression
that
i
am
dead
then
i
must
do
the
other
thing
i
must
really
die
for
a
moment
his
eyes
blazed
angrily
he
felt
like
taking
her
by
the
shoulders
and
shaking
her
as
he
would
have
shaken
the
truth
out
of
a
child
you
come
to
me
with
a
silly
threat
like
that
miss
standish
a
threat
of
suicide
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
yes
and
you
expect
me
to
believe
you
i
had
hoped
you
would
she
had
his
nerves
going
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
he
half
believed
her
and
half
disbelieved
if
she
had
cried
if
she
had
made
the
smallest
effort
to
work
upon
his
sentiment
he
would
have
disbelieved
utterly
but
he
was
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
she
was
making
a
brave
fight
even
though
a
lie
was
behind
it
and
with
a
consciousness
of
pride
that
bewildered
him
she
was
not
humiliating
herself
even
when
she
saw
the
struggle
going
on
within
him
she
made
no
effort
to
turn
the
balance
in
her
favor
she
had
stated
the
facts
as
she
claimed
them
to
be
now
she
waited
her
long
lashes
glistened
a
little
but
her
eyes
were
clear
and
her
hair
glowed
softly
so
softly
that
he
would
never
forget
it
as
she
stood
there
with
her
back
against
the
door
nor
the
strange
desire
that
came
to
him
even
then
to
touch
it
with
his
hand
he
nipped
off
the
end
of
his
cigar
and
lighted
a
match
it
is
rossland
he
said
you
afraid
of
rossland
in
a
way
yes
in
a
large
way
no
i
would
laugh
at
rossland
if
it
were
not
for
the
other
the
why
the
deuce
was
she
so
provokingly
ambiguous
and
she
had
no
intention
of
explaining
she
simply
waited
for
him
to
decide
what
other
he
demanded
i
can
not
tell
you
i
do
want
you
to
hate
me
and
you
would
hate
me
if
i
told
you
the
truth
then
you
confess
you
are
lying
he
suggested
brutally
even
this
did
not
stir
her
as
he
had
expected
it
might
it
did
not
anger
her
or
shame
her
but
she
raised
a
pale
hand
and
a
little
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
he
turned
toward
the
open
port
puffing
at
his
cigar
knowing
she
was
fighting
to
keep
the
tears
back
and
she
succeeded
no
i
am
not
lying
what
i
have
told
you
is
true
it
is
because
i
will
not
lie
that
i
have
not
told
you
more
and
i
thank
you
for
the
time
you
have
given
me
holt
that
you
have
not
driven
me
from
your
cabin
is
a
kindness
which
i
appreciate
i
have
made
a
mistake
that
is
all
i
thought
how
could
i
bring
about
what
you
ask
he
interrupted
i
do
know
you
are
a
man
i
believed
you
could
plan
a
way
but
i
see
now
how
foolish
i
have
been
it
is
impossible
her
hand
reached
slowly
for
the
knob
of
the
door
yes
you
are
foolish
he
agreed
and
his
voice
was
softer
do
let
such
thoughts
overcome
you
miss
standish
go
back
to
your
cabin
and
get
a
night
sleep
do
let
rossland
worry
you
if
you
want
me
to
settle
with
that
man
good
night
mr
holt
she
was
opening
the
door
and
as
she
went
out
she
turned
a
little
and
looked
at
him
and
now
she
was
smiling
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
good
night
good
night
the
door
closed
behind
her
he
heard
her
retreating
footsteps
in
half
a
minute
he
would
have
called
her
back
but
it
was
too
late
chapter
viii
for
half
an
hour
alan
sat
smoking
his
cigar
mentally
he
was
not
at
ease
mary
standish
had
come
to
him
like
a
soldier
and
she
had
left
him
like
a
soldier
but
in
that
last
glimpse
of
her
face
he
had
caught
for
an
instant
something
which
she
had
not
betrayed
in
his
cabin
a
stab
of
what
he
thought
was
pain
in
her
eyes
as
she
smiled
a
proud
regret
possibly
a
shadow
of
humiliation
at
last
or
it
may
have
been
a
pity
for
him
he
was
not
sure
but
it
was
not
despair
not
once
had
she
whimpered
in
look
or
word
even
when
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
the
thought
was
beginning
to
impress
itself
upon
him
that
it
was
he
and
not
mary
standish
who
had
shown
a
yellow
streak
this
night
a
half
shame
fell
upon
him
as
he
smoked
for
it
was
clear
he
had
not
come
up
to
her
judgment
of
him
or
else
he
was
not
so
big
a
fool
as
she
had
hoped
he
might
be
in
his
own
mind
for
a
time
he
was
at
a
loss
to
decide
it
was
possibly
the
first
time
he
had
ever
deeply
absorbed
himself
in
the
analysis
of
a
woman
it
was
outside
his
business
but
born
and
bred
of
the
open
country
it
was
as
natural
for
him
to
recognize
courage
as
it
was
for
him
to
breathe
and
the
girl
courage
was
unusual
now
that
he
had
time
to
think
about
it
it
was
this
thought
of
her
coolness
and
her
calm
refusal
to
impose
her
case
upon
him
with
greater
warmth
that
comforted
him
after
a
little
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
who
was
actually
facing
death
would
have
urged
her
necessity
with
more
enthusiasm
it
seemed
to
him
her
threat
when
he
debated
it
intelligently
was
merely
thrown
in
possibly
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
give
impetus
to
his
decision
she
had
not
meant
it
the
idea
of
a
girl
like
mary
standish
committing
suicide
was
stupendously
impossible
her
quiet
and
wonderful
eyes
her
beauty
and
the
exquisite
care
which
she
gave
to
herself
emphasized
the
absurdity
of
such
a
supposition
she
had
come
to
him
bravely
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
she
had
merely
exaggerated
the
importance
of
her
visit
even
after
he
had
turned
many
things
over
in
his
mind
to
bolster
up
this
conclusion
he
was
still
not
at
ease
against
his
will
he
recalled
certain
unpleasant
things
which
had
happened
within
his
knowledge
under
sudden
and
unexpected
stress
of
emotion
he
tried
to
laugh
the
absurd
stuff
out
of
his
thoughts
and
to
the
end
that
he
might
add
a
new
color
to
his
visionings
he
exchanged
his
cigar
for
a
pipe
which
he
filled
and
lighted
then
he
began
walking
back
and
forth
in
his
cabin
like
a
big
animal
in
a
small
cage
until
at
last
he
stood
with
his
head
half
out
of
the
open
port
looking
at
the
clear
stars
and
setting
the
perfume
of
his
tobacco
adrift
with
the
soft
sea
wind
he
felt
himself
growing
comforted
reason
seated
itself
within
him
again
with
sentiment
shuttled
under
his
feet
if
he
had
been
a
little
harsh
with
miss
standish
tonight
he
would
make
up
for
it
by
apologizing
tomorrow
she
would
probably
have
recovered
her
balance
by
that
time
and
they
would
laugh
over
her
excitement
and
their
little
adventure
that
is
he
would
i
not
at
all
curious
in
the
matter
some
persistent
voice
kept
telling
him
and
i
have
any
interest
in
knowing
what
irrational
whim
drove
her
to
my
cabin
but
he
smoked
viciously
and
smiled
grimly
as
the
voice
kept
at
him
he
would
have
liked
to
obliterate
rossland
from
his
mind
but
rossland
persisted
in
bobbing
up
and
with
him
mary
standish
words
if
i
should
make
an
explanation
you
would
hate
me
or
something
to
that
effect
he
could
remember
exactly
and
he
did
want
to
remember
exactly
for
it
was
none
of
his
business
in
this
humor
with
half
of
his
thoughts
on
one
side
of
the
fence
and
half
on
the
other
he
put
out
his
light
and
went
to
bed
and
he
began
thinking
of
the
range
that
was
pleasanter
for
the
tenth
time
he
figured
out
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
ramparts
of
the
endicott
mountains
rose
up
in
first
welcome
to
his
carl
lomen
following
on
the
next
ship
would
join
him
at
unalaska
they
would
go
on
to
nome
together
after
that
he
would
spend
a
week
or
so
in
the
peninsula
then
go
up
the
kobuk
across
the
big
portage
to
the
koyukuk
and
the
far
headwaters
of
the
north
and
still
farther
beyond
the
last
trails
of
civilized
men
to
his
herds
and
his
people
and
stampede
smith
would
be
with
him
after
a
long
winter
of
homesickness
it
was
all
a
comforting
inducement
to
sleep
and
pleasant
dreams
but
somewhere
there
was
a
wrong
note
in
his
anticipations
tonight
stampede
smith
slipped
away
from
him
and
rossland
took
his
place
and
keok
laughing
changed
into
mary
standish
with
tantalizing
deviltry
it
was
like
keok
alan
thought
drowsily
she
was
always
tormenting
someone
he
felt
better
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
up
flooding
the
wall
of
his
cabin
when
he
awoke
and
under
him
he
could
feel
the
roll
of
the
open
sea
eastward
the
alaskan
coast
was
a
deep
blue
haze
but
the
white
peaks
of
the
elias
range
flung
themselves
high
up
against
the
sky
behind
it
like
snowy
banners
the
was
pounding
ahead
at
full
speed
and
alan
blood
responded
suddenly
to
the
impelling
thrill
of
her
engines
beating
like
twin
hearts
with
the
mighty
force
that
was
speeding
them
on
this
was
business
it
meant
miles
foaming
away
behind
them
and
a
swift
biting
off
of
space
between
him
and
unalaska
midway
of
the
aleutians
he
was
sorry
they
were
losing
time
by
making
the
swing
up
the
coast
to
cordova
and
with
cordova
he
thought
of
mary
standish
he
dressed
and
shaved
and
went
down
to
breakfast
still
thinking
of
her
the
thought
of
meeting
her
again
was
rather
discomforting
now
that
the
time
of
that
possibility
was
actually
at
hand
for
he
dreaded
moments
of
embarrassment
even
when
he
was
not
directly
accountable
for
them
but
mary
standish
saved
him
any
qualms
of
conscience
which
he
might
have
had
because
of
his
lack
of
chivalry
the
preceding
night
she
was
at
the
table
and
she
was
not
at
all
disturbed
when
he
seated
himself
opposite
her
there
was
color
in
her
cheeks
a
fragile
touch
of
that
warm
glow
in
the
heart
of
the
wild
rose
of
the
tundras
and
it
seemed
to
him
there
was
a
deeper
more
beautiful
light
in
her
eyes
than
he
had
ever
seen
before
she
nodded
smiled
at
him
and
resumed
a
conversation
which
she
had
evidently
broken
for
a
moment
with
a
lady
who
sat
next
to
her
it
was
the
first
time
alan
had
seen
her
interested
in
this
way
he
had
no
intention
of
listening
but
something
perverse
and
compelling
overcame
his
will
he
discovered
the
lady
was
going
up
to
teach
in
a
native
school
at
noorvik
on
the
kobuk
river
and
that
for
many
years
she
had
taught
in
dawson
and
knew
well
the
story
of
belinda
mulrooney
he
gathered
that
mary
standish
had
shown
a
great
interest
for
miss
robson
the
teacher
was
offering
to
send
her
a
photograph
she
possessed
of
belinda
mulrooney
if
miss
standish
would
give
her
an
address
the
girl
hesitated
then
said
she
was
not
certain
of
her
destination
but
would
write
miss
robson
at
noorvik
you
will
surely
keep
your
promise
urged
miss
robson
yes
i
will
keep
my
promise
a
sense
of
relief
swept
over
alan
the
words
were
spoken
so
softly
that
he
thought
she
had
not
wanted
him
to
hear
it
was
evident
that
a
few
hours
sleep
and
the
beauty
of
the
morning
had
completely
changed
her
mental
attitude
and
he
no
longer
felt
the
suspicion
of
responsibility
which
had
persisted
in
attaching
itself
to
him
only
a
fool
he
assured
himself
could
possibly
see
a
note
of
tragedy
in
her
appearance
now
nor
was
she
different
at
luncheon
or
at
dinner
during
the
day
he
saw
nothing
of
her
and
he
was
growing
conscious
of
the
fact
that
she
was
purposely
avoiding
contact
with
him
this
did
not
displease
him
it
allowed
him
to
pick
up
the
threads
of
other
interests
in
a
normal
sort
of
way
he
discussed
alaskan
politics
in
the
smoked
his
black
pipe
without
fear
of
giving
offense
and
listened
to
the
talk
of
the
ship
with
a
freedom
of
mind
which
he
had
not
experienced
since
his
first
meeting
with
miss
standish
yet
as
night
drew
on
and
he
walked
his
promenade
about
the
deck
he
felt
gathering
about
him
a
peculiar
impression
of
aloneness
something
was
missing
he
did
not
acknowledge
to
himself
what
it
was
until
as
if
to
convict
him
he
saw
mary
standish
come
out
of
the
door
leading
from
her
cabin
passageway
and
stand
alone
at
the
rail
of
the
ship
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
then
quietly
he
came
up
beside
her
it
has
been
a
wonderful
day
miss
standish
he
said
and
cordova
is
only
a
few
hours
ahead
of
us
she
scarcely
turned
her
face
and
continued
to
look
off
into
the
shrouding
darkness
of
the
sea
yes
a
wonderful
day
holt
she
repeated
after
him
and
cordova
is
only
a
few
hours
ahead
then
in
the
same
soft
unemotional
voice
she
added
i
want
to
thank
you
for
last
night
you
brought
me
to
a
great
decision
i
fear
i
did
not
help
you
it
may
have
been
fancy
of
the
gathering
dusk
that
made
him
believe
he
caught
a
shuddering
movement
of
her
slim
shoulders
i
thought
there
were
two
ways
she
said
but
you
made
me
see
there
was
only
she
emphasized
that
word
it
seemed
to
come
with
a
little
tremble
in
her
voice
i
was
foolish
but
please
let
us
forget
i
want
to
think
of
pleasanter
things
i
am
about
to
make
a
great
experiment
and
it
takes
all
my
courage
you
will
win
miss
standish
he
said
in
a
sure
voice
in
whatever
you
undertake
you
will
win
i
know
it
if
this
experiment
you
speak
of
is
the
adventure
of
coming
to
alaska
seeking
your
fortune
finding
your
life
here
it
will
be
glorious
i
can
assure
you
of
that
she
was
quiet
for
a
moment
and
then
said
the
unknown
has
always
held
a
fascination
for
me
when
we
were
under
the
mountains
in
skagway
yesterday
i
almost
told
you
of
an
odd
faith
which
i
have
i
believe
i
have
lived
before
a
long
time
ago
when
america
was
very
young
at
times
the
feeling
is
so
strong
that
i
must
have
faith
in
it
possibly
i
am
foolish
but
when
the
mountain
swung
back
like
a
great
door
and
we
saw
skagway
i
knew
that
sometime
somewhere
i
had
seen
a
thing
like
that
before
and
i
have
had
strange
visions
of
it
maybe
it
is
a
touch
of
madness
in
me
but
it
is
that
faith
which
gives
me
courage
to
go
on
with
my
experiment
that
and
suddenly
she
faced
him
her
eyes
flaming
you
and
your
suspicions
and
your
brutality
she
went
on
her
voice
trembling
a
little
as
she
drew
herself
up
straight
and
tense
before
him
i
was
going
to
tell
you
holt
but
you
have
given
me
the
opportunity
and
it
may
do
you
good
after
tomorrow
i
came
to
you
because
i
foolishly
misjudged
you
i
thought
you
were
different
like
your
mountains
i
made
a
great
gamble
and
set
you
up
on
a
pedestal
as
clean
and
unafraid
and
believing
all
things
good
until
you
found
them
bad
and
i
lost
i
was
terribly
mistaken
your
first
thoughts
of
me
when
i
came
to
your
cabin
were
suspicious
you
were
angry
and
afraid
yes
fearful
of
something
happening
which
you
did
want
to
happen
you
thought
almost
that
i
was
unclean
and
you
believed
i
was
a
liar
and
told
me
so
it
was
fair
holt
it
was
there
were
things
which
i
could
explain
to
you
but
i
told
you
rossland
knew
i
did
keep
everything
back
and
i
believed
you
were
big
enough
to
think
that
i
was
not
dishonoring
you
with
my
friendship
even
though
i
came
to
your
cabin
oh
i
had
that
much
faith
in
myself
i
did
think
i
would
be
mistaken
for
something
unclean
and
lying
good
god
he
cried
listen
to
me
miss
standish
she
was
gone
so
suddenly
that
his
movement
to
intercept
her
was
futile
and
she
passed
through
the
door
before
he
could
reach
her
again
he
called
her
name
but
her
footsteps
were
almost
running
up
the
passageway
he
dropped
back
his
blood
cold
his
hands
clenched
in
the
darkness
and
his
face
as
white
as
the
girl
had
been
her
words
had
held
him
stunned
and
mute
he
saw
himself
stripped
naked
as
she
believed
him
to
be
and
the
thing
gripped
him
with
a
sort
of
horror
and
she
was
wrong
he
had
followed
what
he
believed
to
be
good
judgment
and
common
sense
if
in
doing
that
he
had
been
an
accursed
fool
determinedly
he
started
for
her
cabin
his
mind
set
upon
correcting
her
malformed
judgment
of
him
there
was
no
light
coming
under
her
door
when
he
knocked
there
was
no
answer
from
within
he
waited
and
tried
again
listening
for
a
sound
of
movement
and
each
moment
he
waited
he
was
readjusting
himself
he
was
half
glad
in
the
end
that
the
door
did
not
open
he
believed
miss
standish
was
inside
and
she
would
undoubtedly
accept
the
reason
for
his
coming
without
an
apology
in
words
he
went
to
his
cabin
and
his
mind
became
increasingly
persistent
in
its
disapproval
of
the
wrong
viewpoint
she
had
taken
of
him
he
was
not
comfortable
no
matter
how
he
looked
at
the
thing
for
her
clear
eyes
her
smoothly
glorious
hair
and
the
pride
and
courage
with
which
she
had
faced
him
remained
with
him
overpoweringly
he
could
not
get
away
from
the
vision
of
her
as
she
had
stood
against
the
door
with
tears
like
diamonds
on
her
cheeks
somewhere
he
had
missed
fire
he
knew
it
something
had
escaped
him
which
he
could
not
understand
and
she
was
holding
him
accountable
the
talk
of
the
did
not
interest
him
tonight
his
efforts
to
become
a
part
of
it
were
forced
a
jazzy
concert
of
piano
and
string
music
in
the
social
hall
annoyed
him
and
a
little
later
he
watched
the
dancing
with
such
grimness
that
someone
remarked
about
it
he
saw
rossland
whirling
round
the
floor
with
a
handsome
young
blonde
in
his
arms
the
girl
was
looking
up
into
his
eyes
smiling
and
her
cheek
lay
unashamed
against
his
shoulder
while
rossland
face
rested
against
her
fluffy
hair
when
they
mingled
closely
with
the
other
dancers
alan
turned
away
an
unpleasant
thought
of
rossland
association
with
mary
standish
in
his
mind
he
strolled
down
into
the
steerage
the
thlinkit
people
had
shut
themselves
in
with
a
curtain
of
blankets
and
from
the
stillness
he
judged
they
were
asleep
the
evening
passed
slowly
for
him
after
that
until
at
last
he
went
to
his
cabin
and
tried
to
interest
himself
in
a
book
it
was
something
he
had
anticipated
reading
but
after
a
little
he
wondered
if
the
writing
was
stupid
or
if
it
was
himself
the
thrill
he
had
always
experienced
with
this
particular
writer
was
missing
there
was
no
inspiration
the
words
were
dead
even
the
tobacco
in
his
pipe
seemed
to
lack
something
and
he
changed
it
for
a
cigar
and
chose
another
book
the
result
was
the
same
his
mind
refused
to
function
and
there
was
no
comfort
in
his
cigar
he
knew
he
was
fighting
against
a
new
thing
even
as
he
subconsciously
lied
to
himself
and
he
was
obstinately
determined
to
win
it
was
a
fight
between
himself
and
mary
standish
as
she
had
stood
against
his
door
mary
standish
the
slim
beauty
of
her
her
courage
a
score
of
things
that
had
never
touched
his
life
before
he
undressed
and
put
on
his
and
slippers
repudiating
the
honesty
of
the
emotions
that
were
struggling
for
acknowledgment
within
him
he
was
a
bit
mad
and
entirely
a
fool
he
told
himself
but
the
assurance
did
him
no
good
he
went
to
bed
propped
himself
up
against
his
pillows
and
made
another
effort
to
read
he
succeeded
at
ten
music
and
dancing
ceased
and
stillness
fell
over
the
ship
after
that
he
found
himself
becoming
more
interested
in
the
first
book
he
had
started
to
read
his
old
satisfaction
slowly
returned
to
him
he
relighted
his
cigar
and
enjoyed
it
distantly
he
heard
the
ship
bells
eleven
and
after
that
the
and
midnight
the
printed
pages
were
growing
dim
and
drowsily
he
marked
his
book
placed
it
on
the
table
and
yawned
they
must
be
nearing
cordova
he
could
feel
the
slackened
speed
of
the
and
the
softer
throb
of
her
engines
probably
they
had
passed
cape
elias
and
were
drawing
inshore
and
then
sudden
and
thrilling
came
a
woman
scream
a
piercing
cry
of
terror
of
agony
and
of
something
else
that
froze
the
blood
in
his
veins
as
he
sprang
from
his
berth
twice
it
came
the
second
time
ending
in
a
moaning
wail
and
a
man
husky
shout
feet
ran
swiftly
past
his
window
he
heard
another
shout
and
then
a
voice
of
command
he
could
not
distinguish
the
words
but
the
ship
herself
seemed
to
respond
there
came
the
sudden
smoothness
of
dead
engines
followed
by
the
pounding
shock
of
reverse
and
the
clanging
alarm
of
a
bell
calling
boats
crews
to
quarters
alan
faced
his
cabin
door
he
knew
what
had
happened
someone
was
overboard
and
in
this
moment
all
life
and
strength
were
gone
out
of
his
body
for
the
pale
face
of
mary
standish
seemed
to
rise
for
an
instant
before
him
and
in
her
quiet
voice
she
was
telling
him
again
that
was
the
other
his
face
went
white
as
he
caught
up
his
flung
open
his
door
and
ran
down
the
dimly
lighted
corridor
chapter
ix
the
reversing
of
the
engines
had
not
stopped
the
momentum
of
the
ship
when
alan
reached
the
open
deck
she
was
fighting
but
still
swept
slowly
ahead
against
the
force
struggling
to
hold
her
back
he
heard
running
feet
voices
and
the
rattle
of
davit
blocks
and
came
up
as
the
starboard
boat
aft
began
swinging
over
the
smooth
sea
captain
rifle
was
ahead
of
him
and
the
second
officer
was
giving
swift
commands
a
dozen
passengers
had
come
from
the
there
was
only
one
woman
she
stood
a
little
back
partly
supported
in
a
arms
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
alan
looked
at
the
man
and
he
knew
from
his
appearance
that
she
was
the
woman
who
had
screamed
he
heard
the
splash
of
the
boat
as
it
struck
water
and
the
rattle
of
oars
but
the
sound
seemed
a
long
distance
away
only
one
thing
came
to
him
distinctly
in
the
sudden
sickness
that
gripped
him
and
that
was
the
terrible
sobbing
of
the
woman
he
went
to
them
and
the
deck
seemed
to
sway
under
his
feet
he
was
conscious
of
a
crowd
gathering
about
the
empty
davits
but
he
had
eyes
only
for
these
two
was
it
a
man
or
a
woman
he
asked
it
did
not
seem
to
him
it
was
his
voice
speaking
the
words
were
forced
from
his
lips
and
the
other
man
with
the
woman
head
crumpled
against
his
shoulder
looked
into
a
face
as
emotionless
as
stone
a
woman
he
replied
this
is
my
wife
we
were
sitting
here
when
she
climbed
upon
the
rail
and
leaped
in
my
wife
screamed
when
she
saw
her
going
the
woman
raised
her
head
she
was
still
sobbing
with
no
tears
in
her
eyes
but
only
horror
her
hands
were
clenched
about
her
husband
arm
she
struggled
to
speak
and
failed
and
the
man
bowed
his
head
to
comfort
her
and
then
captain
rifle
stood
at
their
side
his
face
was
haggard
and
a
glance
told
alan
that
he
knew
who
was
it
he
demanded
this
lady
thinks
it
was
miss
standish
alan
did
not
move
or
speak
something
seemed
to
have
gone
wrong
for
a
moment
in
his
head
he
could
not
hear
distinctly
the
excitement
behind
him
and
before
him
things
were
a
blur
the
sensation
came
and
passed
swiftly
with
no
sign
of
it
in
the
immobility
of
his
pale
face
yes
the
girl
at
your
table
the
pretty
girl
i
saw
her
clearly
and
then
then
it
was
the
woman
the
captain
broke
in
as
she
caught
herself
with
a
choking
breath
it
is
possible
you
are
mistaken
i
can
not
believe
miss
standish
would
do
that
we
shall
soon
know
two
boats
are
gone
and
a
third
lowering
he
was
hurrying
away
throwing
the
last
words
over
his
shoulder
alan
made
no
movement
to
follow
his
brain
cleared
itself
of
shock
and
a
strange
calmness
began
to
possess
him
you
are
quite
sure
it
was
the
girl
at
my
table
he
found
himself
saying
is
it
possible
you
might
be
mistaken
no
said
the
woman
she
was
so
quiet
and
pretty
that
i
have
noticed
her
often
i
saw
her
clearly
in
the
starlight
and
she
saw
me
just
before
she
climbed
to
the
rail
and
jumped
i
almost
sure
she
smiled
at
me
and
was
going
to
speak
and
then
then
she
was
gone
i
did
know
until
my
wife
screamed
added
the
man
i
was
seated
facing
her
at
the
time
i
ran
to
the
rail
and
could
see
nothing
behind
but
the
wash
of
the
ship
i
think
she
went
down
instantly
alan
turned
he
thrust
himself
silently
through
a
crowd
of
excited
and
questioning
people
but
he
did
not
hear
their
questions
and
scarcely
sensed
the
presence
of
their
voices
his
desire
to
make
great
haste
had
left
him
and
he
walked
calmly
and
deliberately
to
the
cabin
where
mary
standish
would
be
if
the
woman
was
mistaken
and
it
was
not
she
who
had
leaped
into
the
sea
he
knocked
at
the
door
only
once
then
he
opened
it
there
was
no
cry
of
fear
or
protest
from
within
and
he
knew
the
room
was
empty
before
he
turned
on
the
electric
light
he
had
known
it
from
the
beginning
from
the
moment
he
heard
the
woman
scream
mary
standish
was
gone
he
looked
at
her
bed
there
was
the
depression
made
by
her
head
in
the
pillow
a
little
handkerchief
lay
on
the
coverlet
crumpled
and
twisted
her
few
possessions
were
arranged
neatly
on
the
reading
table
then
he
saw
her
shoes
and
her
stockings
and
a
dress
on
the
bed
and
he
picked
up
one
of
the
shoes
and
held
it
in
a
cold
steady
hand
it
was
a
little
shoe
his
fingers
closed
about
it
until
it
crushed
like
paper
he
was
holding
it
when
he
heard
someone
behind
him
and
he
turned
slowly
to
confront
captain
rifle
the
little
man
face
was
like
gray
wax
for
a
moment
neither
of
them
spoke
captain
rifle
looked
at
the
shoe
crumpled
in
alan
hand
the
boats
got
away
quickly
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
we
stopped
inside
the
if
she
can
swim
there
is
a
chance
she
wo
swim
replied
alan
she
did
jump
in
for
that
she
is
gone
in
a
vague
and
detached
sort
of
way
he
was
surprised
at
the
calmness
of
his
own
voice
captain
rifle
saw
the
veins
standing
out
on
his
clenched
hands
and
in
his
forehead
through
many
years
he
had
witnessed
tragedy
of
one
kind
and
another
it
was
not
strange
to
him
but
a
look
of
wonderment
shot
into
his
eyes
at
alan
words
it
took
only
a
few
seconds
to
tell
what
had
happened
the
preceding
night
without
going
into
details
the
captain
hand
was
on
alan
arm
when
he
finished
and
the
flesh
under
his
fingers
was
rigid
and
hard
as
steel
we
talk
with
rossland
after
the
boats
return
he
said
he
drew
alan
from
the
room
and
closed
the
door
not
until
he
had
reentered
his
own
cabin
did
alan
realize
he
still
held
the
crushed
shoe
in
his
hand
he
placed
it
on
his
bed
and
dressed
it
took
him
only
a
few
minutes
then
he
went
aft
and
found
the
captain
half
an
hour
later
the
first
boat
returned
five
minutes
after
that
a
second
came
in
and
then
a
third
alan
stood
back
alone
while
the
passengers
crowded
the
rail
he
knew
what
to
expect
and
the
murmur
of
it
came
to
him
failure
it
was
like
a
sob
rising
softly
out
of
the
throats
of
many
people
he
drew
away
he
did
not
want
to
meet
their
eyes
or
talk
with
them
or
hear
the
things
they
would
be
saying
and
as
he
went
a
moan
came
to
his
lips
a
strangled
cry
filled
with
an
agony
which
told
him
he
was
breaking
down
he
dreaded
that
it
was
the
first
law
of
his
kind
to
stand
up
under
blows
and
he
fought
against
the
desire
to
reach
out
his
arms
to
the
sea
and
entreat
mary
standish
to
rise
up
out
of
it
and
forgive
him
he
drove
himself
on
like
a
mechanical
thing
his
white
face
was
a
mask
through
which
burned
no
sign
of
his
grief
and
in
his
eyes
was
a
deadly
coldness
heartless
the
woman
who
had
screamed
might
have
said
and
she
would
have
been
right
his
heart
was
gone
two
people
were
at
rossland
door
when
he
came
up
one
was
captain
rifle
the
other
marston
the
ship
doctor
the
captain
was
knocking
when
alan
joined
them
he
tried
the
door
it
was
locked
i
ca
rouse
him
he
said
and
i
did
not
see
him
among
the
passengers
nor
did
i
said
alan
captain
rifle
fumbled
with
his
master
key
i
think
the
circumstances
permit
he
explained
in
a
moment
he
looked
up
puzzled
the
door
is
locked
on
the
inside
and
the
key
is
in
the
lock
he
pounded
with
his
fist
on
the
panel
he
continued
to
pound
until
his
knuckles
were
red
there
was
still
no
response
odd
he
muttered
very
odd
agreed
alan
his
shoulder
was
against
the
door
he
drew
back
and
with
a
single
crash
sent
it
in
a
pale
light
filtered
into
the
room
from
a
corridor
lamp
and
the
men
stared
rossland
was
in
bed
they
could
see
his
face
dimly
upturned
as
if
staring
at
the
ceiling
but
even
now
he
made
no
movement
and
spoke
no
word
marston
entered
and
turned
on
the
light
after
that
for
ten
seconds
no
man
moved
then
alan
heard
captain
rifle
close
the
door
behind
them
and
from
marston
lips
came
a
startled
whisper
good
god
rossland
was
not
covered
he
was
undressed
and
flat
on
his
back
his
arms
were
stretched
out
his
head
thrown
back
his
mouth
agape
and
the
white
sheet
under
him
was
red
with
blood
it
had
trickled
over
the
edges
and
to
the
floor
his
eyes
were
loosely
closed
after
the
first
shock
doctor
marston
reacted
swiftly
he
bent
over
rossland
and
in
that
moment
when
his
back
was
toward
them
captain
rifle
eyes
met
alan
the
same
thought
and
in
another
instant
disbelief
flashed
from
one
to
the
other
marston
was
speaking
professionally
cool
now
a
knife
stab
close
to
the
right
lung
if
not
in
it
and
an
ugly
bruise
over
his
eye
he
is
not
dead
let
him
lie
as
he
is
until
i
return
with
instruments
and
dressing
the
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
said
alan
as
soon
as
the
doctor
was
gone
and
the
window
is
closed
it
looks
like
suicide
it
is
possible
there
was
an
understanding
between
them
and
rossland
chose
this
way
instead
of
the
sea
captain
rifle
was
on
his
knees
he
looked
under
the
berth
peered
into
the
corners
and
pulled
back
the
blanket
and
sheet
there
is
no
knife
he
said
stonily
and
in
a
moment
he
added
there
are
red
stains
on
the
window
it
was
not
attempted
suicide
it
was
murder
yes
if
rossland
dies
it
was
done
through
the
open
window
someone
called
rossland
to
the
window
struck
him
and
then
closed
the
window
or
it
is
possible
if
he
were
sitting
or
standing
here
that
a
man
might
have
reached
him
it
was
a
man
alan
we
got
to
believe
that
it
was
a
of
course
a
man
alan
nodded
they
could
hear
marston
returning
and
he
was
not
alone
captain
rifle
made
a
gesture
toward
the
door
better
go
he
advised
this
is
a
ship
matter
and
you
wo
want
to
be
unnecessarily
mixed
up
in
it
come
to
my
cabin
in
half
an
hour
i
shall
want
to
see
you
the
second
officer
and
the
purser
were
with
doctor
marston
when
alan
passed
them
and
he
heard
the
door
of
rossland
room
close
behind
him
the
ship
was
trembling
under
his
feet
again
they
were
moving
away
he
went
to
mary
standish
cabin
and
deliberately
gathered
her
belongings
and
put
them
in
the
small
with
which
she
had
come
aboard
without
any
effort
at
concealment
he
carried
the
bag
to
his
room
and
packed
his
own
dunnage
after
that
he
hunted
up
stampede
smith
and
explained
to
him
that
an
unexpected
change
in
his
plans
compelled
them
to
stop
at
cordova
he
was
five
minutes
late
in
his
appointment
with
the
captain
captain
rifle
was
seated
at
his
desk
when
alan
entered
his
cabin
he
nodded
toward
a
chair
we
reach
cordova
inside
of
an
hour
he
said
doctor
marston
says
rossland
will
live
but
of
course
we
can
not
hold
the
in
port
until
he
is
able
to
talk
he
was
struck
through
the
window
i
will
make
oath
to
that
have
you
anything
in
mind
only
one
thing
replied
alan
a
determination
to
go
ashore
as
soon
as
i
can
if
it
is
possible
i
shall
recover
her
body
and
care
for
it
as
for
rossland
it
is
not
a
matter
of
importance
to
me
whether
he
lives
or
dies
mary
standish
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
assault
upon
him
it
was
merely
coincident
with
her
own
act
and
nothing
more
will
you
tell
me
our
location
when
she
leaped
into
the
sea
he
was
fighting
to
retain
his
calmness
his
resolution
not
to
let
captain
rifle
see
clearly
what
the
tragedy
of
her
death
had
meant
to
him
we
were
seven
miles
off
the
eyak
river
coast
a
little
south
and
west
if
her
body
goes
ashore
it
will
be
on
the
island
or
the
mainland
east
of
eyak
river
i
am
glad
you
are
going
to
make
an
effort
there
is
a
chance
and
i
hope
you
will
find
her
captain
rifle
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
nervously
back
and
forth
it
a
bad
blow
for
the
ship
her
first
trip
he
said
but
i
not
thinking
of
the
i
thinking
of
mary
standish
my
god
it
is
terrible
if
it
had
been
anyone
else
his
words
seemed
to
choke
him
and
he
made
a
despairing
gesture
with
his
hands
it
is
hard
to
believe
almost
impossible
to
believe
she
would
deliberately
kill
herself
tell
me
again
what
happened
in
your
cabin
crushing
all
emotion
out
of
his
voice
alan
repeated
briefly
certain
details
of
the
girl
visit
but
a
number
of
things
which
she
had
trusted
to
his
confidence
he
did
not
betray
he
did
not
dwell
upon
rossland
influence
or
her
fear
of
him
captain
rifle
saw
his
effort
and
when
he
had
finished
he
gripped
his
hand
understanding
in
his
eyes
you
not
responsible
not
so
much
as
you
believe
he
said
take
it
too
much
to
heart
alan
but
find
her
find
her
if
you
can
and
let
me
know
you
will
do
that
you
will
let
me
know
yes
i
shall
let
you
know
and
rossland
he
is
a
man
with
many
enemies
i
am
positive
his
assailant
is
still
on
board
undoubtedly
the
captain
hesitated
he
did
not
look
at
alan
as
he
said
there
is
nothing
in
miss
standish
room
even
her
bag
is
gone
i
thought
i
saw
things
in
there
when
i
was
with
you
i
thought
i
saw
something
in
your
hand
but
i
must
have
been
mistaken
she
probably
flung
everything
into
the
sea
before
she
went
such
a
thought
is
possible
agreed
alan
evasively
captain
rifle
drummed
the
top
of
his
desk
with
his
his
face
looked
haggard
and
old
in
the
shaded
light
of
the
cabin
that
all
alan
god
knows
i
give
this
old
life
of
mine
to
bring
her
back
if
i
could
to
me
she
was
much
like
someone
a
long
time
dead
that
why
i
broke
ship
regulations
when
she
came
aboard
so
strangely
at
seattle
without
reservation
i
sorry
now
i
should
have
sent
her
ashore
but
she
is
gone
and
it
is
best
that
you
and
i
keep
to
ourselves
a
little
of
what
we
guess
i
hope
you
will
find
her
and
if
you
do
i
shall
send
you
word
they
shook
hands
and
captain
rifle
fingers
still
held
to
alan
as
they
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
a
swift
change
had
come
in
the
sky
the
stars
were
gone
and
a
moaning
whisper
hovered
over
the
darkened
sea
a
said
the
captain
his
mastery
was
gone
his
shoulders
bent
and
there
was
a
tremulous
note
in
his
voice
that
compelled
alan
to
look
straight
out
into
darkness
and
then
he
said
rossland
will
be
sent
to
the
hospital
in
cordova
if
he
lives
alan
made
no
answer
the
door
closed
softly
behind
him
and
slowly
he
went
through
gloom
to
the
rail
of
the
ship
and
stood
there
with
the
whispered
moaning
of
the
sea
coming
to
him
out
of
a
pit
of
darkness
a
vast
distance
away
he
heard
a
low
intonation
of
thunder
he
struggled
to
keep
hold
of
himself
as
he
returned
to
his
cabin
stampede
smith
was
waiting
for
him
his
dunnage
packed
in
an
oilskin
bag
alan
explained
the
unexpected
change
in
his
plans
business
in
cordova
would
make
him
miss
a
boat
and
would
delay
him
at
least
a
month
in
reaching
the
tundras
it
was
necessary
for
stampede
to
go
on
to
the
range
alone
he
could
make
a
quick
trip
by
way
of
the
government
railroad
to
tanana
after
that
he
would
go
to
allakakat
and
thence
still
farther
north
into
the
endicott
country
it
would
be
easy
for
a
man
like
stampede
to
find
the
range
he
drew
a
map
gave
him
certain
written
instructions
money
and
a
final
warning
not
to
lose
his
head
and
take
up
on
the
way
while
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
go
ashore
at
once
he
advised
stampede
not
to
leave
the
ship
until
morning
and
stampede
swore
on
oath
he
would
not
fail
him
alan
did
not
explain
his
own
haste
and
was
glad
captain
rifle
had
not
questioned
him
too
closely
he
was
not
analyzing
the
reasonableness
of
his
action
he
only
knew
that
every
muscle
in
his
body
was
aching
for
physical
action
and
that
he
must
have
it
immediately
or
break
the
desire
was
a
touch
of
madness
in
his
blood
a
thing
which
he
was
holding
back
by
sheer
force
of
will
he
tried
to
shut
out
the
vision
of
a
pale
face
floating
in
the
sea
he
fought
to
keep
a
grip
on
the
dispassionate
calmness
which
was
a
part
of
him
but
the
ship
itself
was
battering
down
his
stoic
resistance
in
an
hour
since
he
had
heard
the
scream
of
the
woman
he
had
come
to
hate
it
he
wanted
the
feel
of
solid
earth
under
his
feet
he
wanted
with
all
his
soul
to
reach
that
narrow
strip
of
coast
where
mary
standish
was
drifting
in
but
even
stampede
saw
no
sign
of
the
fire
that
was
consuming
him
and
not
until
alan
feet
touched
land
and
cordova
lay
before
him
like
a
great
hole
in
the
mountains
did
the
strain
give
way
within
him
after
he
had
left
the
wharf
he
stood
alone
in
the
darkness
breathing
deeply
of
the
mountain
smell
and
getting
his
bearings
it
was
more
than
darkness
about
him
an
occasional
light
burning
dimly
here
and
there
gave
to
it
the
appearance
of
a
sea
of
ink
threatening
to
inundate
him
the
storm
had
not
broken
but
it
was
close
and
the
air
was
filled
with
a
creeping
warning
the
moaning
of
thunder
was
low
and
yet
very
near
as
if
smothered
by
the
hand
of
a
mighty
force
preparing
to
take
the
earth
unaware
through
the
pit
of
gloom
alan
made
his
way
he
was
not
lost
three
years
ago
he
had
walked
a
score
of
times
to
the
cabin
of
old
olaf
ericksen
half
a
mile
up
the
shore
and
he
knew
ericksen
would
still
be
there
where
he
had
squatted
for
twenty
years
and
where
he
had
sworn
to
stay
until
the
sea
itself
was
ready
to
claim
him
so
he
felt
his
way
instinctively
while
a
crash
of
thunder
broke
over
his
head
the
forces
of
the
night
were
unleashing
he
could
hear
a
gathering
tumult
in
the
mountains
hidden
beyond
the
wall
of
blackness
and
there
came
a
sudden
glare
of
lightning
that
illumined
his
way
it
helped
him
he
saw
a
white
reach
of
sand
ahead
and
quickened
his
steps
and
out
of
the
sea
he
heard
more
distinctly
an
increasing
sound
it
was
as
if
he
walked
between
two
great
armies
that
were
setting
earth
and
sea
atremble
as
they
advanced
to
deadly
combat
the
lightning
came
again
and
after
it
followed
a
discharge
of
thunder
that
gave
to
the
ground
under
his
feet
a
shuddering
tremor
it
rolled
away
echo
upon
echo
through
the
mountains
like
the
booming
of
each
more
distant
than
the
other
a
cold
breath
of
air
struck
alan
in
the
face
and
something
inside
him
rose
up
to
meet
the
thrill
of
storm
he
had
always
loved
the
rolling
echoes
of
thunder
in
the
mountains
and
the
fire
of
lightning
among
their
peaks
on
such
a
night
with
the
crash
of
the
elements
about
his
father
cabin
and
the
roaring
voices
of
the
ranges
filling
the
darkness
with
tumult
his
mother
had
brought
him
into
the
world
love
of
it
was
in
his
blood
a
part
of
his
soul
and
there
were
times
when
he
yearned
for
this
talk
of
the
mountains
as
others
yearn
for
the
coming
of
spring
he
welcomed
it
now
as
his
eyes
sought
through
the
darkness
for
a
glimmer
of
the
light
that
always
burned
from
dusk
until
dawn
in
olaf
ericksen
cabin
he
saw
it
at
last
a
yellow
eye
peering
at
him
through
a
slit
in
an
inky
wall
a
moment
later
the
darker
shadow
of
the
cabin
rose
up
in
his
face
and
a
flash
of
lightning
showed
him
the
door
in
a
moment
of
silence
he
could
hear
the
patter
of
huge
raindrops
on
the
roof
as
he
dropped
his
bags
and
began
hammering
with
his
fist
to
arouse
the
swede
then
he
flung
open
the
unlocked
door
and
entered
tossing
his
dunnage
to
the
floor
and
shouted
the
old
greeting
that
ericksen
would
not
have
forgotten
though
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
had
passed
since
he
and
alan
father
had
tramped
the
mountains
together
he
had
turned
up
the
wick
of
the
oil
lamp
on
the
table
when
into
the
frame
of
an
inner
door
came
ericksen
himself
with
his
huge
bent
shoulders
his
massive
head
his
fierce
eyes
and
a
great
gray
beard
streaming
over
his
naked
chest
he
stared
for
a
moment
and
alan
flung
off
his
hat
and
as
the
storm
broke
beating
upon
the
cabin
in
a
mighty
shock
of
thunder
and
wind
and
rain
a
bellow
of
recognition
came
from
ericksen
they
gripped
hands
the
swede
voice
rose
above
wind
and
rain
and
the
rattle
of
loose
windows
and
he
was
saying
something
about
three
years
ago
and
rubbing
the
sleep
from
his
eyes
when
the
strange
look
in
alan
face
made
him
pause
to
hear
other
words
than
his
own
five
minutes
later
he
opened
a
door
looking
out
over
the
black
sea
bracing
his
arm
against
it
the
wind
tore
in
beating
his
whitening
beard
over
his
shoulders
and
with
it
came
a
deluge
of
rain
that
drenched
him
as
he
stood
there
he
forced
the
door
shut
and
faced
alan
a
great
gray
ghost
of
a
man
in
the
yellow
glow
of
the
oil
lamp
from
then
until
dawn
they
waited
and
in
the
first
break
of
that
dawn
the
long
black
launch
of
olaf
the
swede
nosed
its
way
steadily
out
to
sea
chapter
x
the
wind
had
died
away
but
the
rain
continued
torrential
in
its
downpour
and
the
mountains
grumbled
with
dying
thunder
the
town
was
blotted
out
and
fifty
feet
ahead
of
the
hissing
nose
of
the
launch
alan
could
see
only
a
gray
wall
water
ran
in
streams
from
his
rubber
slicker
and
olaf
great
beard
was
dripping
like
a
wet
rag
he
was
like
a
huge
gargoyle
at
the
wheel
and
in
the
face
of
impenetrable
gloom
he
opened
speed
until
the
was
shooting
with
the
swiftness
of
a
torpedo
through
the
sea
in
olaf
cabin
alan
had
listened
to
the
folly
of
expecting
to
find
mary
standish
between
eyak
river
and
katalla
was
a
mainland
of
battered
reefs
and
rocks
and
an
archipelago
of
islands
in
which
a
pirate
fleet
might
have
found
a
hundred
in
his
experience
of
twenty
years
ericksen
had
never
known
of
the
finding
of
a
body
washed
ashore
and
he
stated
firmly
his
belief
that
the
girl
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
the
impulse
to
go
on
grew
no
less
in
alan
it
quickened
with
the
straining
eagerness
of
the
as
the
slim
craft
leaped
through
the
water
even
the
drone
of
thunder
and
the
beat
of
rain
urged
him
on
to
him
there
was
nothing
absurd
in
the
quest
he
was
about
to
make
it
was
the
least
he
could
do
and
the
only
honest
thing
he
could
do
he
kept
telling
himself
and
there
was
a
chance
that
he
would
find
her
all
through
his
life
had
run
that
element
of
chance
usually
it
was
against
odds
he
had
won
and
there
rode
with
him
in
the
gray
dawn
a
conviction
he
was
going
to
win
now
that
he
would
find
mary
standish
somewhere
in
the
sea
or
along
the
coast
between
eyak
river
and
the
first
of
the
islands
against
which
the
shoreward
current
drifted
and
when
he
found
her
he
had
not
gone
beyond
that
but
it
pressed
upon
him
now
and
in
moments
it
overcame
him
and
he
saw
her
in
a
way
which
he
was
fighting
to
keep
out
of
his
mind
death
had
given
a
vivid
clearness
to
his
mental
pictures
of
her
a
strip
of
white
beach
persisted
in
his
mind
and
waiting
for
him
on
this
beach
was
the
slim
body
of
the
girl
her
pale
face
turned
up
to
the
morning
sun
her
long
hair
streaming
over
the
sand
it
was
a
vision
that
choked
him
and
he
struggled
to
keep
away
from
it
if
he
found
her
like
that
he
knew
at
last
what
he
would
do
it
was
the
final
crumbling
away
of
something
inside
him
the
breaking
down
of
that
other
alan
holt
whose
negative
laws
and
blindness
had
sent
mary
standish
to
her
death
truth
seemed
to
mock
at
him
flaying
him
for
that
invulnerable
poise
in
which
he
had
taken
such
an
egotistical
pride
for
she
had
come
to
in
her
hour
of
trouble
and
there
were
five
hundred
others
aboard
the
she
had
believed
in
him
had
given
him
her
friendship
and
her
confidence
and
at
the
last
had
placed
her
life
in
his
hands
and
when
he
had
failed
her
she
had
not
gone
to
another
she
had
kept
her
word
proving
to
him
she
was
not
a
liar
and
a
fraud
and
he
knew
at
last
the
courage
of
womanhood
and
the
truth
of
her
words
you
will
understand
tomorrow
he
kept
the
fight
within
himself
olaf
did
not
see
it
as
the
dawn
lightened
swiftly
into
the
beginning
of
day
there
was
no
change
in
the
tense
lines
of
his
face
and
the
grim
resolution
in
his
eyes
and
olaf
did
not
press
his
folly
upon
him
but
kept
the
pointed
seaward
adding
still
greater
speed
as
the
huge
shadow
of
the
headland
loomed
up
in
the
direction
of
hinchinbrook
island
with
increasing
day
the
rain
subsided
it
fell
in
a
drizzle
for
a
time
and
then
stopped
alan
threw
off
his
slicker
and
wiped
the
water
from
his
eyes
and
hair
white
mists
began
to
rise
and
through
them
shot
faint
of
light
olaf
grunted
approbation
as
he
wrung
water
from
his
beard
the
sun
was
breaking
through
over
the
mountain
tops
and
straight
above
as
the
mist
dissolved
was
radiant
blue
sky
the
miracle
of
change
came
swiftly
in
the
next
storm
had
washed
the
air
until
it
was
like
tonic
a
salty
perfume
rose
from
the
sea
and
olaf
stood
up
and
stretched
himself
and
shook
the
wet
from
his
body
as
he
drank
the
sweetness
into
his
lungs
shoreward
alan
saw
the
mountains
taking
form
and
one
after
another
they
rose
up
like
living
things
their
crests
catching
the
fire
of
the
sun
dark
inundations
of
forest
took
up
the
shimmering
gleam
green
slopes
rolled
out
from
behind
veils
of
smoking
vapor
and
suddenly
in
a
final
triumph
of
the
sun
the
alaskan
coast
lay
before
him
in
all
its
glory
the
swede
made
a
great
gesture
of
exultation
with
his
free
arm
grinning
at
his
companion
pride
and
the
joy
of
living
in
his
bearded
face
but
in
alan
there
was
no
change
dully
he
sensed
the
wonder
of
day
and
of
sunlight
breaking
over
the
mighty
ranges
to
the
sea
but
something
was
missing
the
soul
of
it
was
gone
and
the
old
thrill
was
dead
he
felt
the
tragedy
of
it
and
his
lips
tightened
even
as
he
met
the
smile
for
he
no
longer
made
an
effort
to
blind
himself
to
the
truth
olaf
began
to
guess
deeply
at
that
truth
now
that
he
could
see
face
in
the
pitiless
light
of
the
day
and
after
a
little
the
thing
lay
naked
in
his
mind
the
quest
was
not
a
matter
of
duty
nor
was
it
inspired
by
the
captain
of
the
as
alan
had
given
him
reason
to
believe
there
was
more
than
grimness
in
the
other
face
and
a
strange
sort
of
sickness
lay
in
his
eyes
a
little
later
he
observed
the
straining
eagerness
with
which
those
eyes
scanned
the
softly
undulating
surface
of
the
sea
at
last
he
said
if
captain
rifle
was
right
the
girl
went
overboard
and
he
pointed
alan
stood
up
but
she
would
be
there
now
olaf
added
in
his
heart
he
believed
she
was
straight
down
at
the
bottom
he
turned
his
boat
shoreward
creeping
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
was
the
white
sand
of
the
beach
three
or
four
miles
away
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
a
spiral
of
smoke
detached
itself
from
the
rocks
and
timber
that
came
down
close
to
the
sea
that
mccormick
he
said
alan
made
no
answer
through
olaf
binoculars
he
picked
out
the
scotchman
cabin
it
was
sandy
mccormick
olaf
had
assured
him
who
knew
every
eddy
and
drift
in
fifty
miles
of
coast
and
with
his
eyes
shut
could
find
mary
standish
if
she
came
ashore
and
it
was
sandy
who
came
down
to
greet
them
when
ericksen
dropped
his
anchor
in
shallow
water
they
leaped
out
and
waded
to
the
beach
and
in
the
door
of
the
cabin
beyond
alan
saw
a
woman
looking
down
at
them
wonderingly
sandy
himself
was
young
and
more
like
a
boy
than
a
man
they
shook
hands
then
alan
told
of
the
tragedy
aboard
the
and
what
his
mission
was
he
made
a
great
effort
to
speak
calmly
and
believed
that
he
succeeded
certainly
there
was
no
break
of
emotion
in
his
cold
even
voice
and
at
the
same
time
no
possibility
of
evading
its
deadly
earnestness
mccormick
whose
means
of
livelihood
were
frequently
more
unsubstantial
than
real
listened
to
the
offer
of
pecuniary
reward
for
his
services
with
something
like
shock
fifty
dollars
a
day
for
his
time
and
an
additional
five
thousand
dollars
if
he
found
the
girl
body
to
alan
the
sums
meant
nothing
he
was
not
measuring
dollars
and
if
he
had
said
ten
thousand
or
twenty
thousand
the
detail
of
price
would
not
have
impressed
him
as
important
he
possessed
as
much
money
as
that
in
the
nome
banks
and
a
little
more
and
had
the
thing
been
practicable
he
would
as
willingly
have
offered
his
reindeer
herds
could
they
have
guaranteed
him
the
possession
of
what
he
sought
in
olaf
face
mccormick
caught
a
look
which
explained
the
situation
a
little
alan
holt
was
not
mad
he
was
as
any
other
man
might
be
who
had
lost
the
most
precious
thing
in
the
world
and
unconsciously
as
he
pledged
his
services
in
acceptance
of
the
offer
he
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
little
woman
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
cabin
alan
met
her
she
was
a
quiet
she
smiled
gravely
at
olaf
gave
her
hand
to
alan
and
her
blue
eyes
dilated
when
she
heard
what
had
happened
aboard
the
alan
left
the
three
together
and
returned
to
the
beach
while
between
the
loading
and
the
lighting
of
his
pipe
the
swede
told
what
he
had
guessed
that
this
girl
whose
body
would
never
be
washed
ashore
was
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
world
to
alan
holt
for
many
miles
they
searched
the
beach
that
day
while
sandy
mccormick
skirmished
among
the
islands
south
and
eastward
in
a
light
he
was
in
a
way
a
paul
revere
spreading
intelligence
and
with
scotch
canniness
made
a
good
bargain
for
himself
in
a
dozen
cabins
he
left
details
of
the
drowning
and
offered
a
reward
of
five
hundred
dollars
for
the
finding
of
the
body
so
that
twenty
men
and
boys
and
half
as
many
women
were
seeking
before
nightfall
and
remember
sandy
told
each
of
them
the
chances
are
she
wash
ashore
sometime
between
tomorrow
and
three
days
later
if
she
comes
ashore
at
all
in
the
dusk
of
that
first
day
alan
found
himself
ten
miles
up
the
coast
he
was
alone
for
olaf
ericksen
had
gone
in
the
opposite
direction
it
was
a
different
alan
who
watched
the
setting
sun
dipping
into
the
western
sea
with
the
golden
slopes
of
the
mountains
reflecting
its
glory
behind
him
it
was
as
if
he
had
passed
through
a
great
sickness
and
up
from
the
earth
of
his
own
beloved
land
had
crept
slowly
into
his
body
and
soul
a
new
understanding
of
life
there
was
despair
in
his
face
but
it
was
a
gentler
thing
now
the
harsh
lines
of
an
obstinate
will
were
gone
from
about
his
mouth
his
eyes
no
longer
concealed
their
grief
and
there
was
something
in
his
attitude
of
a
man
chastened
by
a
consuming
fire
he
retraced
his
steps
through
deepening
twilight
and
with
each
mile
of
his
questing
return
there
grew
in
him
that
something
which
had
come
to
him
out
of
death
and
which
he
knew
would
never
leave
him
and
with
this
change
the
droning
softness
of
the
night
itself
seemed
to
whisper
that
the
sea
would
not
give
up
its
dead
olaf
and
sandy
mccormick
and
sandy
wife
were
in
the
cabin
when
he
returned
at
midnight
he
was
exhausted
seven
months
in
the
states
had
softened
him
he
explained
he
did
not
inquire
how
successful
the
others
had
been
he
knew
the
woman
eyes
told
him
the
almost
mothering
eagerness
in
them
when
he
came
through
the
door
she
had
coffee
and
food
ready
for
him
and
he
forced
himself
to
eat
sandy
gave
a
report
of
what
he
had
done
and
olaf
smoked
his
pipe
and
tried
to
speak
cheerfully
of
the
splendid
weather
that
was
coming
tomorrow
not
one
of
them
spoke
of
mary
standish
alan
felt
the
strain
they
were
under
and
knew
his
presence
was
the
cause
of
it
so
he
lighted
his
own
pipe
after
eating
and
talked
to
ellen
mccormick
about
the
splendor
of
the
mountains
back
of
eyak
river
and
how
fortunate
she
was
to
have
her
home
in
this
little
corner
of
paradise
he
caught
a
flash
of
something
unspoken
in
her
eyes
it
was
a
lonely
place
for
a
woman
alone
without
children
and
he
spoke
about
children
to
sandy
smiling
they
should
have
children
a
lot
of
them
sandy
blushed
and
olaf
let
out
a
boom
of
laughter
but
the
woman
face
was
unflushed
and
serious
only
her
eyes
betrayed
her
something
wistful
and
appealing
in
them
as
she
looked
at
sandy
we
building
a
new
cabin
he
said
and
there
two
rooms
in
it
specially
for
kids
there
was
pride
in
his
voice
as
he
made
pretense
to
light
a
pipe
that
was
already
lighted
and
pride
in
the
look
he
gave
his
young
wife
a
moment
later
ellen
mccormick
deftly
covered
with
her
apron
something
which
lay
on
a
little
table
near
the
door
through
which
alan
had
to
pass
to
enter
his
olaf
eyes
twinkled
but
alan
did
not
see
only
he
knew
there
should
be
children
here
where
there
was
surely
love
it
did
not
occur
to
him
as
being
strange
that
he
alan
holt
should
think
of
such
a
matter
at
all
the
next
morning
the
search
was
resumed
sandy
drew
a
crude
map
of
certain
hidden
places
up
the
east
coast
where
drifts
and
tossed
the
flotsam
of
the
sea
and
alan
set
out
for
these
shores
with
olaf
at
the
wheel
of
the
it
was
sunset
when
they
returned
and
in
the
calm
of
a
wonderful
evening
with
the
comforting
peace
of
the
mountains
smiling
down
at
them
olaf
believed
the
time
had
come
to
speak
what
was
in
his
mind
he
spoke
first
of
the
weird
tricks
of
the
alaskan
waters
and
of
strange
forces
deep
down
under
the
surface
which
he
had
never
had
explained
to
him
and
of
how
he
had
lost
a
cask
once
upon
a
time
and
a
week
later
had
run
upon
it
well
upon
its
way
to
japan
he
emphasized
the
playfulness
of
the
undertows
and
the
treachery
of
them
then
he
came
bluntly
to
the
point
of
the
matter
it
would
be
better
if
mary
standish
never
did
come
ashore
it
would
be
days
probably
weeks
if
it
ever
happened
at
all
and
there
would
be
nothing
about
her
for
alan
to
recognize
better
a
peaceful
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
that
was
what
he
called
it
a
peaceful
and
in
his
earnestness
to
soothe
another
grief
he
blundered
still
more
deeply
into
the
horror
of
it
all
describing
certain
details
of
what
flesh
and
bone
could
and
could
not
stand
until
alan
felt
like
clubbing
him
beyond
the
power
of
speech
he
was
glad
when
he
saw
the
mccormick
cabin
sandy
was
waiting
for
them
when
they
waded
ashore
something
unusual
was
in
his
face
alan
thought
and
for
a
moment
his
heart
waited
in
suspense
but
the
scotchman
shook
his
head
negatively
and
went
close
to
olaf
ericksen
alan
did
not
see
the
look
that
passed
between
them
he
went
to
the
cabin
and
ellen
mccormick
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
when
he
entered
it
was
an
unusual
thing
for
her
to
do
and
there
was
a
glow
in
her
eyes
which
had
not
been
there
last
night
and
a
flush
in
her
cheeks
and
a
new
strange
note
in
her
voice
when
she
spoke
to
him
it
was
almost
exultation
something
she
was
trying
to
keep
back
you
you
did
find
her
she
asked
no
his
voice
was
tired
and
a
little
old
do
you
think
i
shall
ever
find
her
not
as
you
have
expected
she
answered
quietly
she
will
never
come
like
that
she
seemed
to
be
making
an
effort
you
you
would
give
a
great
deal
to
have
her
back
mr
holt
her
question
was
childish
in
its
absurdity
and
she
was
like
a
child
looking
at
him
as
she
did
in
this
moment
he
forced
a
smile
to
his
lips
and
nodded
of
course
everything
i
possess
you
you
loved
her
her
voice
trembled
it
was
odd
she
should
ask
these
questions
but
the
probing
did
not
sting
him
it
was
not
a
woman
curiosity
that
inspired
them
and
the
comforting
softness
in
her
voice
did
him
good
he
had
not
realized
before
how
much
he
wanted
to
answer
that
question
not
only
for
himself
but
for
someone
else
aloud
yes
i
did
the
confession
almost
startled
him
it
seemed
an
amazing
confidence
to
be
making
under
any
circumstances
and
especially
upon
such
brief
acquaintance
but
he
said
no
more
though
in
ellen
mccormick
face
and
eyes
was
a
tremulous
expectancy
he
stepped
into
the
little
room
which
had
been
his
sleeping
place
and
returned
with
his
out
of
this
he
took
the
bag
in
which
were
mary
standish
belongings
and
gave
it
to
sandy
wife
it
was
a
matter
of
business
now
and
he
tried
to
speak
in
a
businesslike
way
her
things
are
inside
i
got
them
in
her
cabin
if
you
find
her
after
i
am
gone
you
will
need
them
you
understand
of
course
and
if
you
do
find
her
keep
them
for
me
i
shall
return
some
day
it
seemed
hard
for
him
to
give
his
simple
instructions
he
went
on
i
do
think
i
shall
stay
any
longer
but
i
will
leave
a
certified
check
at
cordova
and
it
will
be
turned
over
to
your
husband
when
she
is
found
and
if
you
do
find
her
you
will
look
after
her
yourself
wo
you
mrs
mccormick
ellen
mccormick
choked
a
little
as
she
answered
him
promising
to
do
what
he
asked
he
would
always
remember
her
as
a
sympathetic
little
thing
and
half
an
hour
later
after
he
had
explained
everything
to
sandy
he
wished
her
happiness
when
he
took
her
hand
in
saying
her
hand
was
trembling
he
wondered
at
it
and
said
something
to
sandy
about
the
priceless
value
of
a
happiness
such
as
his
as
they
went
down
to
the
beach
the
velvety
darkness
of
the
sky
was
athrob
with
the
of
stars
when
the
shimmering
trail
led
once
more
out
to
sea
alan
looked
up
at
them
and
his
mind
groped
strangely
in
the
infinity
that
lay
above
him
he
had
never
measured
it
before
life
had
been
too
full
but
now
it
seemed
so
vast
and
his
range
in
the
tundras
so
far
away
that
a
great
loneliness
seized
upon
him
as
he
turned
his
eyes
to
look
back
at
the
dimly
white
dissolving
swiftly
in
the
gloom
that
lay
beneath
the
mountains
chapter
xi
that
night
in
olaf
cabin
alan
put
himself
back
on
the
old
track
again
he
made
no
effort
to
minimize
the
tragedy
that
had
come
into
his
life
and
he
knew
its
effect
upon
him
would
never
be
wiped
away
and
that
mary
standish
would
always
live
in
his
thoughts
no
matter
what
happened
in
the
years
to
come
but
he
was
not
the
sort
to
let
any
part
of
himself
wither
up
and
die
because
of
a
blow
that
had
darkened
his
mental
visions
of
things
his
plans
lay
ahead
of
him
his
old
ambitions
and
his
dreams
of
achievement
they
seemed
pulseless
and
dead
now
but
he
knew
it
was
because
his
own
fire
had
temporarily
burned
out
and
he
realized
the
vital
necessity
of
building
it
up
again
so
he
first
wrote
a
letter
to
ellen
mccormick
and
in
this
placed
a
second
letter
carefully
sealed
which
was
not
to
be
opened
unless
they
found
mary
standish
and
which
contained
something
he
had
found
impossible
to
put
into
words
in
sandy
cabin
it
was
trivial
and
embarrassing
when
spoken
to
others
but
it
meant
a
great
deal
to
him
then
he
made
the
final
arrangements
for
olaf
to
carry
him
to
seward
in
the
for
captain
rifle
ship
was
well
on
her
way
to
unalaska
thought
of
captain
rifle
urged
him
to
write
another
letter
in
which
he
told
briefly
the
disappointing
details
of
his
search
he
was
rather
surprised
the
next
morning
to
find
he
had
entirely
forgotten
rossland
while
he
was
attending
to
his
affairs
at
the
bank
olaf
secured
information
that
rossland
was
resting
comfortably
in
the
hospital
and
had
not
one
chance
in
ten
of
dying
it
was
not
intention
to
see
him
he
wanted
to
hear
nothing
he
might
have
to
say
about
mary
standish
to
associate
them
in
any
way
as
he
thought
of
her
now
was
little
short
of
sacrilege
he
was
conscious
of
the
change
in
himself
for
it
was
rather
an
amazing
upsetting
of
the
original
alan
holt
that
person
would
have
gone
to
rossland
with
the
deliberate
and
businesslike
intention
of
sifting
the
matter
to
the
bottom
that
he
might
disprove
his
own
responsibility
and
set
himself
right
in
his
own
eyes
in
he
would
have
given
rossland
an
opportunity
to
break
down
with
cold
facts
the
disturbing
something
which
his
mind
had
unconsciously
built
up
but
the
new
alan
revolted
he
wanted
to
carry
the
thing
away
with
him
he
wanted
it
to
live
and
so
it
went
with
him
uncontaminated
by
any
truths
or
lies
which
rossland
might
have
told
him
they
left
cordova
early
in
the
afternoon
and
at
sunset
that
evening
camped
on
the
tip
of
a
wooded
island
a
mile
or
two
from
the
mainland
olaf
knew
the
island
and
had
chosen
it
for
reasons
of
his
own
it
was
primitive
and
alive
with
birds
olaf
loved
the
birds
and
the
cheer
of
their
vesper
song
and
bedtime
twitter
comforted
alan
he
seized
an
ax
and
for
the
first
time
in
seven
months
his
muscles
responded
to
the
swing
of
it
and
ericksen
old
as
his
years
in
the
way
of
the
north
whistled
loudly
and
rumbled
a
bit
of
crude
song
through
his
beard
as
he
lighted
a
fire
knowing
the
medicine
of
the
big
open
was
getting
its
hold
on
alan
again
to
alan
it
was
like
coming
to
the
edge
of
home
once
more
it
seemed
an
age
an
infinity
since
he
had
heard
the
sputtering
of
bacon
in
an
open
skillet
and
the
bubbling
of
coffee
over
a
bed
of
coals
with
the
mysterious
darkness
of
the
timber
gathering
in
about
him
he
loaded
his
pipe
after
his
chopping
and
sat
watching
olaf
as
he
mothered
the
bannock
loaf
it
made
him
think
of
his
father
a
thousand
times
the
two
must
have
camped
like
this
in
the
days
when
alaska
was
new
and
there
were
no
maps
to
tell
them
what
lay
beyond
the
next
range
olaf
felt
resting
upon
him
something
of
the
responsibility
of
a
doctor
and
after
supper
he
sat
with
his
back
to
a
tree
and
talked
of
the
old
days
as
if
they
were
yesterday
and
the
day
before
with
tomorrow
always
the
pot
of
gold
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow
which
he
had
pursued
for
thirty
years
he
was
sixty
just
a
week
ago
this
evening
he
said
and
he
was
beginning
to
doubt
if
he
would
remain
on
the
beach
at
cordova
much
longer
siberia
was
dragging
him
that
forbidden
world
of
adventure
and
mystery
and
monumental
opportunity
which
lay
only
a
few
miles
across
the
strait
from
the
seward
peninsula
in
his
enthusiasm
he
forgot
tragedy
he
cursed
cossack
law
and
the
prohibitory
measures
to
keep
americans
out
more
gold
was
over
there
than
had
ever
been
dreamed
of
in
alaska
even
the
mountains
and
rivers
were
unnamed
and
he
was
going
if
he
lived
another
year
or
two
going
to
find
his
fortune
or
his
end
in
the
stanovoi
mountains
and
among
the
chukchi
tribes
twice
he
had
tried
it
since
his
old
comrade
had
died
and
twice
he
had
been
driven
out
the
next
time
he
would
know
how
to
go
about
it
and
he
invited
alan
to
go
with
him
there
was
a
thrill
in
this
talk
of
a
land
so
near
scarcely
a
night
ride
across
the
neck
of
bering
sea
and
yet
as
proscribed
as
the
sacred
plains
of
tibet
it
stirred
old
desires
in
alan
blood
for
he
knew
that
of
all
frontiers
the
siberian
would
be
the
last
and
the
greatest
and
that
not
only
men
but
nations
would
play
their
part
in
the
breaking
of
it
he
saw
the
red
gleam
of
firelight
in
olaf
eyes
and
if
we
do
go
in
first
from
alan
the
yellow
fellows
will
come
out
some
day
from
rumbled
the
old
striking
his
pipe
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
when
they
do
they
wo
come
over
to
us
in
ones
an
twos
an
threes
but
in
millions
that
what
the
yellow
fellows
will
do
when
they
once
get
started
it
up
to
a
few
alaska
jacks
an
bills
to
get
their
feet
planted
first
on
the
other
side
will
you
go
alan
shook
his
head
some
day
but
not
now
the
old
flash
was
in
his
eyes
and
he
was
seeing
the
fight
ahead
of
him
again
the
fight
to
do
his
bit
in
striking
the
shackles
of
misgovernment
from
alaska
and
rousing
the
world
to
an
understanding
of
the
menace
which
hung
over
her
like
a
smoldering
cloud
but
you
right
about
the
danger
he
said
it
wo
come
from
japan
to
california
it
will
pour
like
a
flood
through
siberia
and
jump
to
alaska
in
a
night
it
is
the
danger
of
the
yellow
man
alone
olaf
you
got
to
combine
that
with
bolshevism
the
menace
of
blackest
russia
a
disease
which
if
it
crosses
the
little
neck
of
water
and
gets
hold
of
alaska
will
shake
the
american
continent
to
it
may
be
a
generation
from
now
maybe
a
century
but
coming
sure
as
god
makes
light
if
we
let
alaska
go
down
and
out
and
my
way
of
preventing
it
is
different
from
yours
he
stared
into
the
fire
watching
the
embers
flare
up
and
die
i
not
proud
of
the
states
he
went
on
as
if
speaking
to
something
which
he
saw
in
the
flames
i
ca
be
after
the
ruin
their
unintelligent
propaganda
and
legislation
have
brought
upon
alaska
but
they
our
salvation
and
conditions
are
improving
i
concede
we
have
factions
in
alaska
and
we
are
not
at
all
unanimous
in
what
we
want
it
going
to
be
largely
a
matter
of
education
we
ca
take
alaska
down
to
the
states
we
got
to
bring
them
up
to
us
we
must
make
a
large
part
of
a
hundred
and
ten
million
americans
understand
we
must
bring
a
million
of
them
up
here
before
that
we
speak
of
comes
beyond
the
gulf
of
anadyr
it
god
own
country
we
have
north
of
olaf
and
we
have
ten
times
the
wealth
of
california
we
can
care
for
a
million
people
easily
but
bad
politics
and
bad
judgment
both
here
in
alaska
and
at
washington
wo
let
them
come
with
coal
enough
under
our
feet
to
last
a
thousand
years
we
are
buying
fuel
from
the
states
got
billions
in
copper
and
oil
but
ca
touch
them
we
should
have
some
of
the
world
greatest
manufacturing
plants
but
we
can
not
because
everything
up
here
is
locked
away
from
us
i
repeat
that
conservation
if
they
had
applied
a
little
of
it
to
the
salmon
industry
but
they
did
and
the
salmon
are
going
like
the
buffalo
of
the
plains
the
destruction
of
the
salmon
shows
what
will
happen
to
us
if
the
bars
are
let
down
all
at
once
to
the
financial
banditti
understanding
and
common
sense
must
guard
the
gates
the
fight
we
must
win
is
to
bring
about
an
honest
and
reasonable
adjustment
olaf
and
that
fight
will
take
place
right
here
in
alaska
and
not
in
siberia
and
if
we
do
win
he
raised
his
eyes
from
the
fire
and
smiled
grimly
into
olaf
bearded
face
then
we
can
count
on
that
thing
coming
across
the
neck
of
sea
from
the
gulf
of
anadyr
he
finished
and
if
it
ever
does
come
the
people
of
the
states
will
at
last
face
the
tragic
realization
of
what
alaska
could
have
meant
to
the
nation
the
force
of
the
old
spirit
surged
uppermost
in
alan
again
and
after
that
for
an
hour
or
more
something
lived
for
him
in
the
glow
of
the
fire
which
olaf
kept
burning
it
was
the
memory
of
mary
standish
her
quiet
beautiful
eyes
gazing
at
him
her
pale
face
taking
form
in
the
lacy
wisps
of
his
mind
pictured
her
in
the
as
she
had
listened
to
him
that
day
in
skagway
when
he
had
told
her
of
this
fight
that
was
ahead
and
it
pleased
him
to
think
she
would
have
made
this
same
fight
for
alaska
if
she
had
lived
it
was
a
thought
which
brought
a
painful
thickening
in
his
breath
for
always
these
visions
which
olaf
could
not
see
ended
with
mary
standish
as
she
had
faced
him
in
his
cabin
her
back
against
the
door
her
lips
trembling
and
her
eyes
softly
radiant
with
tears
in
the
broken
pride
of
that
last
moment
of
her
plea
for
life
he
could
not
have
told
how
long
he
slept
that
night
dreams
came
to
him
in
his
restless
slumber
and
always
they
awakened
him
so
that
he
was
looking
at
the
stars
again
and
trying
not
to
think
in
spite
of
the
grief
in
his
soul
they
were
pleasant
dreams
as
though
some
gentle
force
were
at
work
in
him
subconsciously
to
wipe
away
the
shadows
of
tragedy
mary
standish
was
with
him
again
between
the
mountains
at
skagway
she
was
at
his
side
in
the
heart
of
the
tundras
the
sun
in
her
shining
hair
and
eyes
and
all
about
them
the
wonder
of
wild
roses
and
purple
iris
and
white
seas
of
and
daisies
and
birds
singing
in
the
gladness
of
summer
he
heard
the
birds
and
he
heard
the
girl
voice
answering
them
in
her
happiness
and
turning
that
happiness
from
the
radiance
of
her
eyes
upon
him
when
he
awoke
it
was
with
a
little
cry
as
if
someone
had
stabbed
him
and
olaf
was
building
a
fire
and
dawn
was
breaking
in
over
the
mountains
chapter
xii
this
first
night
and
dawn
in
the
heard
of
his
wilderness
with
the
new
import
of
life
gleaming
down
at
him
from
the
mighty
peaks
of
the
chugach
and
kenai
ranges
marked
the
beginning
of
that
uplift
which
drew
alan
out
of
the
pit
into
which
he
had
fallen
he
understood
now
how
it
was
that
through
many
long
years
his
father
had
worshiped
the
memory
of
a
woman
who
had
died
it
seemed
to
him
an
infinity
ago
unnumbered
times
he
had
seen
the
miracle
of
her
presence
in
his
father
eyes
and
once
when
they
had
stood
overlooking
a
valley
back
in
the
mountains
the
elder
holt
had
said
years
ago
the
twelfth
day
of
last
month
mother
went
with
me
through
this
valley
alan
do
you
see
the
little
bend
in
the
creek
with
the
great
rock
in
the
sun
we
rested
there
before
you
were
born
he
had
spoken
of
that
day
as
if
it
had
been
but
yesterday
and
alan
recalled
the
strange
happiness
in
his
father
face
as
he
had
looked
down
upon
something
in
the
valley
which
no
other
but
himself
could
see
and
it
was
happiness
the
same
strange
happiness
that
began
to
build
itself
a
house
close
up
against
the
grief
in
heart
it
would
never
be
a
house
quite
empty
never
again
would
he
be
alone
he
knew
at
last
it
was
an
undying
part
of
him
as
it
had
been
a
part
of
his
father
clinging
to
him
in
sweet
pain
encouraging
him
pressing
gently
upon
him
the
beginning
of
a
great
faith
that
somewhere
beyond
was
a
place
to
meet
again
in
the
many
days
that
followed
it
grew
in
him
but
in
a
way
no
man
or
woman
could
see
it
was
a
secret
about
which
he
built
a
wall
setting
it
apart
from
that
stoical
placidity
of
his
nature
which
some
people
called
indifference
olaf
could
see
farther
than
others
because
he
had
known
alan
father
as
a
brother
it
had
always
been
that
way
with
the
elder
holt
straight
clean
and
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
in
times
of
hurt
olaf
had
seen
him
face
death
like
that
he
had
seen
him
rise
up
with
awesome
courage
from
the
beautiful
form
that
had
turned
to
clay
under
his
eyes
and
fight
forth
again
into
a
world
burned
to
ashes
something
of
that
look
which
he
had
seen
in
the
eyes
of
the
father
he
saw
in
alan
in
these
days
when
they
nosed
their
way
up
the
alaskan
coast
together
only
to
himself
did
alan
speak
the
name
of
mary
standish
just
as
his
father
had
kept
elizabeth
holt
name
sacred
in
his
own
heart
olaf
with
mildly
casual
eyes
and
strong
in
the
possession
of
memories
observed
how
much
alike
they
were
but
discretion
held
his
tongue
and
he
said
nothing
to
alan
of
many
things
that
ran
in
his
mind
he
talked
of
siberia
always
of
siberia
and
did
not
hurry
on
the
way
to
seward
alan
himself
felt
no
great
urge
to
make
haste
the
days
were
soft
with
the
premature
breath
of
summer
the
nights
were
cold
and
filled
with
stars
day
after
day
mountains
hung
about
them
like
mighty
castles
whose
battlements
reached
up
into
the
of
the
sky
they
kept
close
to
the
mainland
and
among
the
islands
camping
early
each
evening
birds
were
coming
northward
by
the
thousand
and
each
night
olaf
sent
up
the
delicious
aroma
of
and
roasts
when
at
last
they
reached
seward
and
the
time
came
for
olaf
to
turn
back
there
was
an
odd
blinking
in
the
old
swede
eyes
and
as
a
final
comfort
alan
told
him
again
that
the
day
would
probably
come
when
he
would
go
to
siberia
with
him
after
that
he
watched
the
until
the
little
boat
was
lost
in
the
distance
of
the
sea
alone
alan
felt
once
more
a
greater
desire
to
reach
his
own
country
and
he
was
fortunate
two
days
after
his
arrival
at
seward
the
steamer
which
carried
mail
and
the
necessities
of
life
to
the
string
of
settlements
reaching
a
thousand
miles
out
into
the
pacific
left
resurrection
bay
and
he
was
given
passage
thereafter
the
countless
islands
of
the
north
pacific
drifted
behind
while
always
northward
were
the
gray
cliffs
of
the
alaskan
peninsula
with
the
ramparted
ranges
beyond
glistening
with
glaciers
smoking
with
occasional
volcanoes
and
at
times
so
high
their
snowy
peaks
were
lost
in
the
clouds
first
touching
the
hatchery
at
karluk
and
then
the
canneries
at
uyak
and
chignik
the
mail
boat
visited
the
settlements
on
the
island
of
unga
and
thence
covered
swiftly
the
three
hundred
miles
to
dutch
harbor
and
unalaska
again
he
was
fortunate
within
a
week
he
was
berthed
on
a
freighter
and
on
the
twelfth
day
of
june
set
foot
in
nome
his
was
unheralded
but
the
little
gray
town
with
its
peculiar
black
shadowings
its
sea
of
and
its
two
solitary
brick
chimneys
brought
a
lump
of
joy
into
his
throat
as
he
watched
its
growing
outlines
from
the
small
boat
that
brought
him
ashore
he
could
see
one
of
the
only
two
brick
chimneys
in
northern
alaska
gleaming
in
the
sun
beyond
it
fifty
miles
away
were
the
ragged
peaks
of
the
range
looking
as
if
one
might
walk
to
them
in
half
an
hour
and
over
all
the
world
between
seemed
to
hover
a
misty
gloom
but
it
was
where
he
had
lived
where
happiness
and
tragedy
and
unforgetable
memories
had
come
to
him
and
the
welcoming
of
its
frame
buildings
its
crooked
streets
and
what
to
others
might
have
been
ugliness
was
a
warm
and
thrilling
thing
for
here
were
his
here
were
the
men
and
women
who
were
guarding
the
northern
door
of
the
world
an
epic
place
filled
with
strong
hearts
courage
and
a
love
of
country
as
inextinguishable
as
one
love
of
life
from
this
drab
little
place
shut
out
from
all
the
world
for
half
the
year
young
men
and
women
went
down
to
southern
universities
to
big
cities
to
the
glamor
and
lure
of
outside
but
they
always
came
back
nome
called
them
its
loneliness
in
winter
its
gray
gloom
in
springtime
its
glory
in
summer
and
autumn
it
was
the
of
a
new
race
of
men
and
they
loved
it
as
alan
loved
it
to
him
the
black
wireless
tower
meant
more
than
the
statue
of
liberty
the
three
church
spires
more
than
the
architectural
colossi
of
new
york
and
washington
beside
one
of
the
churches
he
had
played
as
a
boy
he
had
seen
the
steeples
painted
he
had
helped
make
the
crooked
streets
and
his
mother
had
laughed
and
lived
and
died
here
and
his
father
footprints
had
been
in
the
white
sands
of
the
beach
when
tents
dotted
the
shore
like
gulls
when
he
stepped
ashore
people
stared
at
him
and
then
greeted
him
he
was
unexpected
and
the
surprise
of
his
arrival
added
strength
to
the
grip
which
men
hands
gave
him
he
had
not
heard
voices
like
theirs
down
in
the
states
with
a
gladness
in
them
that
was
almost
excitement
small
boys
ran
up
to
his
side
and
with
white
men
came
the
eskimo
grinning
and
shaking
his
hands
word
traveled
swiftly
that
alan
holt
had
come
back
from
the
states
before
the
day
was
over
it
was
on
its
way
to
shelton
and
candle
and
keewalik
and
kotzebue
sound
such
was
the
beginning
of
his
but
ahead
of
the
news
of
his
arrival
alan
walked
up
front
street
stopped
at
bahlke
restaurant
for
a
cup
of
coffee
and
then
dropped
casually
into
lomen
offices
in
the
tin
bank
building
for
a
week
alan
remained
in
nome
carl
lomen
had
arrived
a
few
days
before
and
his
brothers
were
in
from
the
big
ranges
over
on
the
choris
peninsula
it
had
been
a
good
winter
and
promised
to
be
a
tremendously
successful
summer
the
lomen
herds
would
exceed
forty
thousand
head
when
the
final
figures
were
in
a
hundred
other
herds
were
prospering
and
the
eskimo
and
lapps
were
and
plump
with
good
feeding
and
prosperity
a
third
of
a
million
reindeer
were
on
the
hoof
in
alaska
and
the
breeders
were
exultant
pretty
good
when
compared
with
the
fact
that
in
there
were
less
than
five
thousand
in
another
twenty
years
there
would
be
ten
million
but
with
this
prosperity
of
the
present
and
still
greater
promise
for
the
future
alan
sensed
the
undercurrent
of
unrest
and
suspicion
in
nome
after
waiting
and
hoping
through
another
long
winter
with
their
best
men
fighting
for
alaska
salvation
at
washington
word
was
traveling
from
mouth
to
mouth
from
settlement
to
settlement
and
from
range
to
range
that
the
bureaucracy
which
misgoverned
them
from
thousands
of
miles
away
was
not
lifting
a
hand
to
relieve
them
federal
refused
to
surrender
their
deadly
power
and
their
strangling
methods
were
to
continue
coal
which
should
cost
ten
dollars
a
ton
if
dug
from
alaskan
mines
would
continue
to
cost
forty
dollars
cold
storage
from
nome
would
continue
to
be
dollars
a
ton
when
it
should
be
twenty
commercial
brigandage
was
still
given
letters
of
marque
bureaus
were
fighting
among
themselves
for
greater
power
and
in
the
turmoil
alaska
was
still
chained
like
a
starving
man
just
outside
the
reach
of
all
the
milk
and
honey
in
a
wonderful
land
pauperizing
degrading
actually
killing
the
political
misrule
that
had
already
driven
per
cent
of
alaska
population
from
their
homes
was
to
continue
indefinitely
a
president
of
the
united
states
had
promised
to
visit
the
mighty
land
of
the
north
and
see
with
his
own
eyes
but
would
he
come
there
had
been
other
promises
many
of
them
and
promises
had
always
been
futile
but
it
was
a
hope
that
crept
through
alaska
and
upon
this
hope
men
whose
courage
never
died
began
to
build
freedom
was
on
its
way
even
if
slowly
justice
must
triumph
ultimately
as
it
always
triumphed
rusty
keys
would
at
last
be
turned
in
the
locks
which
had
kept
from
alaskans
all
the
riches
and
resources
of
their
country
and
these
men
were
determined
to
go
on
building
against
odds
that
they
might
be
better
prepared
for
that
freedom
of
human
endeavor
when
it
came
in
these
days
when
the
fires
of
achievement
needed
to
be
encouraged
and
not
smothered
neither
alan
nor
carl
lomen
emphasized
the
menace
of
gigantic
financial
interests
like
that
controlled
by
john
graham
interests
fighting
to
do
away
with
the
best
friend
alaska
ever
had
the
biological
survey
and
backing
with
all
their
power
the
ruinous
legislation
to
put
alaska
in
the
control
of
a
group
of
five
men
that
an
aggrandizement
even
more
deadly
than
a
suffocating
policy
of
conservation
might
be
more
easily
accomplished
instead
they
spread
the
optimism
of
men
possessed
of
inextinguishable
faith
the
blackest
days
were
gone
rifts
were
breaking
in
the
clouds
intelligence
was
creeping
through
like
rays
of
sunshine
the
end
of
alaska
serfdom
was
near
at
hand
so
they
preached
and
knew
they
were
preaching
truth
for
what
remained
of
alaska
men
after
years
of
hopelessness
and
distress
were
fighting
men
and
the
women
who
had
remained
with
them
were
the
mothers
and
wives
of
a
new
nation
in
the
making
these
mothers
and
wives
alan
met
during
his
week
in
nome
he
would
have
given
his
life
if
a
few
million
people
in
the
states
could
have
known
these
women
something
would
have
happened
then
and
the
sisterhood
of
half
a
continent
possessing
the
power
of
the
ballot
would
have
opened
their
arms
to
them
men
like
john
graham
would
have
gone
out
of
existence
alaska
would
have
received
her
birthright
for
these
women
were
of
the
kind
who
greeted
the
sun
each
day
and
the
gloom
of
winter
with
something
greater
than
hope
in
their
hearts
they
too
were
builders
fear
of
god
and
love
of
land
lay
deep
in
their
souls
and
side
by
side
with
their
they
went
on
in
this
epic
struggle
for
the
building
of
a
nation
at
the
top
of
the
world
many
times
during
this
week
alan
felt
it
in
his
heart
to
speak
of
mary
standish
but
in
the
end
not
even
to
carl
lomen
did
word
of
her
escape
his
lips
the
passing
of
each
day
had
made
her
more
intimately
a
part
of
him
and
a
secret
part
he
could
not
tell
people
about
her
he
even
made
evasions
when
questioned
about
his
business
and
experiences
at
cordova
and
up
the
coast
curiously
she
seemed
nearer
to
him
when
he
was
away
from
other
men
and
women
he
remembered
it
had
been
that
way
with
his
father
who
was
always
happiest
when
in
the
deep
mountains
or
the
unending
tundras
and
so
alan
thrilled
with
an
inner
gladness
when
his
business
was
finished
and
the
day
came
for
him
to
leave
nome
carl
lomen
went
with
him
as
far
as
the
big
herd
on
choris
peninsula
for
one
hundred
miles
up
to
shelton
they
rode
over
a
railway
on
a
drawn
by
dogs
and
it
seemed
to
alan
at
times
as
though
mary
standish
were
with
him
riding
in
this
strange
way
through
a
great
wilderness
he
could
her
that
was
the
strange
thing
which
began
to
possess
him
there
were
moments
when
her
eyes
were
shining
softly
upon
him
her
lips
smiling
her
presence
so
real
he
might
have
spoken
to
her
if
lomen
had
not
been
at
his
side
he
did
not
fight
against
these
visionings
it
pleased
him
to
think
of
her
going
with
him
into
the
heart
of
alaska
riding
the
picturesque
losing
herself
in
the
mountains
and
in
his
tundras
with
all
the
wonder
and
glory
of
a
new
world
breaking
upon
her
a
little
at
a
time
like
the
unfolding
of
a
great
mystery
for
there
was
both
wonder
and
glory
in
these
countless
miles
running
ahead
and
drifting
behind
and
the
miracle
of
life
the
days
were
long
night
as
mary
standish
had
always
known
night
was
gone
on
the
twentieth
of
june
there
were
twenty
hours
of
day
with
a
dim
and
beautiful
twilight
between
the
hours
of
eleven
and
one
sleep
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
but
was
regulated
by
the
hands
of
the
watch
a
world
frozen
to
the
core
for
seven
months
was
bursting
open
like
a
great
flower
from
shelton
alan
and
his
companion
visited
the
eighty
or
ninety
people
at
candle
and
thence
continued
down
the
keewalik
river
to
keewalik
on
kotzebue
sound
a
lomen
run
by
lapps
carried
them
to
choris
peninsula
where
for
a
week
alan
remained
with
lomen
and
his
huge
herd
of
fifteen
thousand
reindeer
he
was
eager
to
go
on
but
tried
to
hide
his
impatience
something
was
urging
him
whipping
him
on
to
greater
haste
for
the
first
time
in
months
he
heard
the
crackling
thunder
of
reindeer
hoofs
and
the
music
of
it
was
like
a
wild
call
from
his
own
herds
hurrying
him
home
he
was
glad
when
the
came
and
his
business
was
done
the
took
him
to
kotzebue
it
was
night
as
his
watch
went
when
paul
davidovich
started
up
the
delta
of
the
kobuk
river
with
him
in
a
lighterage
company
boat
but
there
was
no
darkness
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
they
came
to
the
redstone
two
hundred
miles
above
the
mouth
of
the
kobuk
as
the
river
winds
they
had
supper
together
on
the
shore
after
that
paul
davidovich
turned
back
with
the
slow
sweep
of
the
current
waving
his
hand
until
he
was
out
of
sight
not
until
the
sound
of
the
russian
was
lost
in
distance
did
alan
sense
fully
the
immensity
of
the
freedom
that
swept
upon
him
at
last
after
months
that
had
seemed
like
so
many
years
he
was
north
and
eastward
stretched
the
unmarked
trail
which
he
knew
so
well
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
straight
as
a
bird
might
fly
almost
unmapped
unpeopled
right
up
to
the
doors
of
his
range
in
the
slopes
of
the
endicott
mountains
a
little
cry
from
his
own
lips
gave
him
a
start
it
was
as
if
he
had
called
out
aloud
to
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
and
to
keok
and
nawadlook
telling
them
he
was
on
his
way
home
and
would
soon
be
there
never
had
this
hidden
land
which
he
had
found
for
himself
seemed
so
desirable
as
it
did
in
this
hour
there
was
something
about
it
that
was
to
that
other
thing
which
had
become
a
part
of
him
now
it
was
holding
out
its
arms
to
him
understanding
welcoming
inspiring
him
to
travel
strongly
and
swiftly
the
space
between
and
he
was
ready
to
answer
its
call
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
five
in
the
afternoon
he
had
spent
a
long
day
with
the
russian
but
he
felt
no
desire
for
rest
or
sleep
the
of
the
tundras
coming
to
him
through
the
thin
timber
of
the
worked
like
an
intoxicant
in
his
blood
it
was
the
tundra
he
wanted
before
he
lay
down
upon
his
back
with
his
face
to
the
stars
he
was
eager
to
get
away
from
timber
and
to
feel
the
immeasurable
space
of
the
big
country
the
open
country
about
him
what
fool
had
given
to
it
the
name
of
what
idiots
people
were
to
lie
about
it
in
that
way
on
the
maps
he
strapped
his
pack
over
his
shoulders
and
seized
his
rifle
barren
lands
he
set
out
walking
like
a
man
in
a
race
and
long
before
the
twilight
hours
of
sleep
they
were
sweeping
out
ahead
of
him
in
all
their
glory
the
barren
lands
of
the
paradise
on
a
knoll
he
stood
in
the
golden
sun
and
looked
about
him
he
set
his
pack
down
and
stood
with
bared
head
a
whispering
of
cool
wind
in
his
hair
if
mary
standish
could
have
lived
to
see
he
stretched
out
his
arms
as
if
pointing
for
her
eyes
to
follow
and
her
name
was
in
his
heart
and
whispering
on
his
silent
lips
immeasurable
the
tundras
reached
ahead
of
him
rolling
sweeping
treeless
green
and
golden
and
a
glory
of
flowers
athrill
with
a
life
no
forest
land
had
ever
known
under
his
feet
was
a
crush
of
and
of
white
and
purple
violets
their
sweet
perfume
filling
his
lungs
as
he
breathed
ahead
of
him
lay
a
white
sea
of
daisies
with
purple
iris
high
as
his
knees
in
between
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
waving
softly
in
the
breeze
was
the
sedge
he
loved
the
pods
were
green
in
a
few
days
they
would
be
opening
and
the
tundras
would
be
white
carpets
he
listened
to
the
call
of
life
it
was
about
him
everywhere
a
melody
of
subdued
and
sleepy
even
though
the
sun
was
still
warmly
aglow
in
the
sky
a
hundred
times
he
had
watched
this
miracle
of
bird
instinct
the
of
feathered
creatures
in
the
weeks
and
months
when
there
was
no
real
night
he
picked
up
his
pack
and
went
on
from
a
pool
hidden
in
the
lush
grasses
of
a
distant
hollow
came
to
him
the
twilight
honking
of
nesting
geese
and
the
quacking
content
of
wild
ducks
he
heard
the
musical
notes
of
a
lone
and
the
plaintive
cries
of
plover
and
farther
out
where
the
shadows
seemed
deepening
against
the
rim
of
the
horizon
rose
the
harsh
rolling
notes
of
cranes
and
the
raucous
cries
of
the
loons
and
then
from
a
clump
of
willows
near
him
came
the
chirping
twitter
of
a
thrush
whose
throat
was
tired
for
the
day
and
the
sweet
sleepy
evening
song
of
a
robin
alan
laughed
softly
the
pale
flush
of
the
sun
in
his
face
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
nine
nine
and
the
flowers
still
answering
to
the
glow
of
the
sun
and
the
people
down
there
in
the
states
called
it
a
frozen
land
a
hell
of
ice
and
snow
at
the
end
of
the
earth
a
place
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
well
to
just
such
extremes
had
stupidity
and
ignorance
gone
through
all
the
years
of
history
even
though
men
called
themselves
of
intelligence
and
knowledge
it
was
humorous
and
it
was
tragic
at
last
he
came
to
a
shining
pool
between
two
tufted
ridges
and
in
this
velvety
hollow
the
twilight
was
gathering
like
a
shadow
in
a
cup
a
little
creek
ran
out
of
the
pool
and
here
alan
gathered
soft
grass
and
spread
out
his
blankets
a
great
stillness
drew
in
about
him
broken
only
by
the
old
squaws
and
the
loons
at
eleven
he
could
still
see
clearly
the
sleeping
on
the
surface
of
the
pool
but
the
stars
were
appearing
it
grew
duskier
and
the
of
the
sun
faded
into
purple
gloom
as
pale
night
drew
near
four
hours
of
rest
that
was
neither
darkness
nor
day
with
a
pillow
of
sedge
and
grass
under
his
head
he
slept
the
song
and
cry
of
wakened
him
and
at
dawn
he
bathed
in
the
pool
with
dozens
of
fluffy
ducks
dodging
away
from
him
among
the
grasses
and
reeds
that
day
and
the
next
and
the
day
after
that
he
traveled
steadily
into
the
heart
of
the
tundra
country
swiftly
and
almost
without
rest
it
seemed
to
him
at
last
that
he
must
be
in
that
country
where
all
the
of
the
world
was
born
for
wherever
there
was
water
in
the
pools
and
little
streams
and
the
hollows
between
the
ridges
the
voice
of
it
in
the
morning
was
a
babel
of
sound
out
of
the
sweet
breast
of
the
earth
he
could
feel
the
irresistible
pulse
of
motherhood
filling
him
with
its
strength
and
its
courage
and
whispering
to
him
its
everlasting
message
that
because
of
the
glory
and
need
and
faith
of
life
had
god
created
this
land
of
day
and
twilight
in
it
in
these
days
of
summer
was
no
abiding
place
for
gloom
yet
in
his
own
heart
as
he
drew
nearer
to
his
home
was
a
place
of
darkness
which
its
light
could
not
quite
enter
the
tundras
had
made
mary
standish
more
real
to
him
in
the
treeless
spaces
in
the
vast
reaches
with
only
the
sky
shutting
out
his
vision
she
seemed
to
be
walking
nearer
to
him
almost
with
her
hand
in
his
at
times
it
was
like
a
torture
inflicted
upon
him
for
his
folly
and
when
he
visioned
what
might
have
been
and
recalled
too
vividly
that
it
was
he
who
had
stilled
with
death
that
living
glory
which
dwelt
with
him
in
spirit
now
a
crying
sob
of
which
he
was
not
ashamed
came
from
his
lips
for
when
he
thought
too
deeply
he
knew
that
mary
standish
would
have
lived
if
he
had
said
other
things
to
her
that
night
aboard
the
ship
she
had
died
not
for
him
but
of
him
because
in
his
failure
to
live
up
to
what
she
believed
she
had
found
in
him
he
had
broken
down
what
must
have
been
her
last
hope
and
her
final
faith
if
he
had
been
less
blind
and
god
had
given
him
the
inspiration
of
a
greater
wisdom
she
would
have
been
walking
with
him
now
laughing
in
the
dawn
growing
tired
amid
the
flowers
sleeping
under
the
clear
stars
happy
and
unafraid
and
looking
to
him
for
all
things
at
least
so
he
dreamed
in
his
immeasurable
loneliness
he
did
not
tolerate
the
thought
that
other
forces
might
have
called
her
even
had
she
lived
and
that
she
might
not
have
been
his
to
hold
and
to
fight
for
he
did
not
question
the
possibility
of
shackles
and
chains
that
might
have
bound
her
or
other
inclinations
that
might
have
led
her
he
claimed
her
now
that
she
was
dead
and
knew
that
living
he
would
have
possessed
her
nothing
could
have
kept
him
from
that
but
she
was
gone
and
for
that
he
was
accountable
and
the
fifth
night
he
lay
sleepless
under
the
stars
and
like
a
boy
he
cried
for
her
with
his
face
upon
his
arm
and
when
morning
came
and
he
went
on
never
had
the
world
seemed
so
vast
and
empty
his
face
was
gray
and
haggard
a
face
grown
suddenly
old
and
he
traveled
slowly
for
the
desire
to
reach
his
people
was
dying
within
him
he
could
not
laugh
with
keok
and
nawadlook
or
give
the
old
tundra
call
to
amuk
toolik
and
his
people
who
would
be
riotous
in
their
happiness
at
his
return
they
loved
him
he
knew
that
their
love
had
been
a
part
of
his
life
and
the
knowledge
that
his
response
to
this
love
would
be
at
best
a
poor
and
broken
thing
filled
him
with
dread
a
strange
sickness
crept
through
his
blood
it
grew
in
his
head
so
that
when
noon
came
he
did
not
trouble
himself
to
eat
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
he
saw
far
ahead
of
him
the
clump
of
cottonwoods
near
the
warm
springs
very
near
his
home
often
he
had
come
to
these
old
cottonwoods
an
oasis
of
timber
lost
in
the
great
tundras
and
he
had
built
himself
a
little
camp
among
them
he
loved
the
place
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
now
and
then
he
must
visit
the
forlorn
trees
to
give
them
cheer
and
comradeship
his
father
name
was
carved
in
the
bole
of
the
greatest
of
them
all
and
under
it
the
date
and
day
when
the
elder
holt
had
discovered
them
in
a
land
where
no
man
had
gone
before
and
under
his
father
name
was
his
mother
and
under
that
his
own
he
had
made
of
the
place
a
sort
of
shrine
a
green
and
tabernacle
of
memories
and
its
and
peace
in
summer
and
the
weird
aloneness
of
it
in
winter
had
played
their
parts
in
the
making
of
his
soul
through
many
months
he
had
anticipated
this
hour
of
his
when
in
the
distance
he
would
see
the
beckoning
welcome
of
the
old
cottonwoods
with
the
rolling
foothills
and
frosted
peaks
of
the
endicott
mountains
beyond
and
now
he
was
looking
at
the
trees
and
the
mountains
and
something
was
lacking
in
the
thrill
of
them
he
came
up
from
the
west
between
two
willow
ridges
through
which
ran
the
little
creek
from
the
warm
springs
and
he
was
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
them
when
something
stopped
him
in
his
tracks
at
first
he
thought
the
sound
was
the
popping
of
guns
but
in
a
moment
he
knew
it
could
not
be
so
and
the
truth
flashed
suddenly
upon
him
this
day
was
the
fourth
of
july
and
someone
in
the
cottonwoods
was
shooting
firecrackers
a
smile
softened
his
lips
he
recalled
keok
mischievous
habit
of
lighting
a
whole
bunch
at
one
time
for
which
apparent
wastefulness
nawadlook
never
failed
to
scold
her
they
had
prepared
for
his
with
a
celebration
and
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
had
probably
imported
a
supply
of
from
allakakat
or
tanana
the
oppressive
weight
inside
him
lifted
and
the
smile
remained
on
his
lips
and
then
as
if
commanded
by
a
voice
his
eyes
turned
to
the
dead
cottonwood
stub
which
had
sentineled
the
little
oasis
of
trees
for
many
years
at
the
very
crest
of
it
floating
bravely
in
the
breeze
that
came
with
the
evening
sun
was
an
american
flag
he
laughed
softly
these
were
the
people
who
loved
him
who
thought
of
him
who
wanted
him
back
his
heart
beat
faster
stirred
by
the
old
happiness
and
he
drew
himself
quickly
into
a
strip
of
willows
that
grew
almost
up
to
the
cottonwoods
he
would
surprise
them
he
would
walk
suddenly
in
among
them
unseen
and
unheard
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
amaze
and
delight
them
he
came
to
the
first
of
the
trees
and
concealed
himself
carefully
he
heard
the
popping
of
individual
firecrackers
and
the
louder
bang
of
one
of
the
giants
that
always
made
nawadlook
put
her
fingers
in
her
pretty
ears
he
crept
stealthily
over
a
knoll
down
through
a
hollow
and
then
up
again
to
the
opposite
crest
it
was
as
he
had
thought
he
could
see
keok
a
hundred
yards
away
standing
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
and
as
he
looked
she
tossed
another
bunch
of
sputtering
crackers
away
from
her
the
others
were
probably
circled
about
her
out
of
his
sight
watching
her
performance
he
continued
cautiously
making
his
way
so
that
he
could
come
up
behind
a
thick
growth
of
bush
unseen
within
a
dozen
paces
of
them
at
last
he
was
as
near
as
that
to
her
and
keok
was
still
standing
on
the
log
with
her
back
toward
him
it
puzzled
him
that
he
could
not
see
or
hear
the
others
and
something
about
keok
puzzled
him
too
and
then
his
heart
gave
a
sudden
throb
and
seemed
to
stop
its
beating
it
was
not
keok
on
the
log
and
it
was
not
nawadlook
he
stood
up
and
stepped
out
from
his
the
slender
figure
of
the
girl
on
the
log
turned
a
little
and
he
saw
the
glint
of
golden
sunshine
in
her
hair
he
called
out
keok
was
he
mad
had
the
sickness
in
his
head
turned
his
brain
and
then
mary
he
called
she
turned
and
in
that
moment
alan
holt
face
was
the
color
of
gray
rock
it
was
the
dead
he
had
been
thinking
of
and
it
was
the
dead
that
had
risen
before
him
now
for
it
was
mary
standish
who
stood
there
on
the
old
cottonwood
log
shooting
firecrackers
in
this
evening
of
his
chapter
xiii
after
that
one
calling
of
her
name
alan
voice
was
dead
and
he
made
no
movement
he
could
not
disbelieve
it
was
not
a
mental
illusion
or
a
temporary
upsetting
of
his
sanity
it
was
truth
the
shock
of
it
was
rending
every
nerve
in
his
body
even
as
he
stood
as
if
carved
out
of
wood
and
then
a
strange
relaxation
swept
over
him
some
force
seemed
to
pass
out
of
his
flesh
and
his
arms
hung
limp
she
was
there
he
could
see
the
whiteness
leave
her
face
and
a
flush
of
color
come
into
it
and
he
heard
a
little
cry
as
she
jumped
down
from
the
log
and
came
toward
him
it
had
all
happened
in
a
few
seconds
but
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
alan
he
saw
nothing
about
her
or
beyond
her
it
was
as
if
she
were
floating
up
to
him
out
of
the
cold
mists
of
the
sea
and
she
stopped
only
a
step
away
from
him
when
she
saw
more
clearly
what
was
in
his
face
it
must
have
been
something
that
startled
her
vaguely
he
realized
this
and
made
an
effort
to
recover
himself
you
almost
frightened
me
she
said
we
have
been
expecting
you
and
watching
for
you
and
i
was
out
there
a
few
minutes
ago
looking
back
over
the
tundra
the
sun
was
in
my
eyes
and
i
did
see
you
it
seemed
incredible
that
he
should
be
hearing
her
voice
the
same
voice
unexcited
sweet
and
thrilling
speaking
as
if
she
had
seen
him
yesterday
and
with
a
certain
reserved
gladness
was
welcoming
him
again
today
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
realize
in
these
moments
the
immeasurable
distance
that
lay
between
their
viewpoints
he
was
simply
alan
holt
she
was
the
dead
risen
to
life
many
times
in
his
grief
he
had
visualized
what
he
would
do
if
some
miracle
could
bring
her
back
to
him
like
this
he
had
thought
of
taking
her
in
his
arms
and
never
letting
her
go
but
now
that
the
miracle
had
come
to
pass
and
she
was
within
his
reach
he
stood
without
moving
trying
only
to
speak
you
mary
standish
he
said
at
last
i
thought
he
did
not
finish
it
was
not
himself
speaking
it
was
another
individual
within
him
a
detached
individual
trying
to
explain
his
lack
of
physical
expression
he
wanted
to
cry
out
his
gladness
to
shout
with
joy
yet
the
directing
soul
of
action
in
him
was
stricken
she
touched
his
arm
hesitatingly
i
did
think
you
would
care
she
said
i
thought
you
mind
if
i
came
up
here
care
the
word
was
like
an
explosion
setting
things
loose
in
his
brain
and
the
touch
of
her
hand
sent
a
sweep
of
fire
through
him
he
heard
himself
cry
out
a
strange
unhuman
sort
of
cry
as
he
swept
her
to
his
breast
he
held
her
close
crushing
kisses
upon
her
mouth
his
fingers
buried
in
her
hair
her
slender
body
almost
broken
in
his
arms
she
was
alive
she
had
come
back
to
him
and
he
forgot
everything
in
these
blind
moments
but
that
great
truth
which
was
sweeping
over
him
in
a
glorious
inundation
then
suddenly
he
found
that
she
was
fighting
him
struggling
to
free
herself
and
putting
her
hands
against
his
face
in
her
efforts
she
was
so
close
that
he
seemed
to
see
nothing
but
her
eyes
and
in
them
he
did
not
see
what
he
had
dreamed
of
finding
but
horror
it
was
a
stab
that
went
into
his
heart
and
his
arms
relaxed
she
staggered
back
trembling
and
swaying
a
little
as
she
got
her
breath
her
face
very
white
he
had
hurt
her
the
hurt
was
in
her
eyes
in
the
way
she
looked
at
him
as
if
he
had
become
a
menace
from
which
she
would
run
if
he
had
not
taken
the
strength
from
her
as
she
stood
there
her
parted
lips
showing
the
red
of
his
kisses
her
shining
hair
almost
undone
he
held
out
his
hands
mutely
you
think
i
came
here
for
she
panted
no
he
said
forgive
me
i
am
sorry
it
was
not
anger
that
he
saw
in
her
face
it
was
instead
a
mingling
of
shock
and
physical
hurt
a
measurement
of
him
now
as
she
looked
at
him
which
recalled
her
to
him
as
she
had
stood
that
night
with
her
back
against
his
cabin
door
yet
he
was
not
trying
to
piece
things
together
even
subconsciously
that
was
impossible
for
all
life
in
him
was
centered
in
the
one
stupendous
thought
that
she
was
not
dead
but
living
and
he
did
not
wonder
why
there
was
no
question
in
his
mind
as
to
the
manner
in
which
she
had
been
saved
from
the
sea
he
felt
a
weakness
in
his
limbs
he
wanted
to
laugh
to
cry
out
to
give
himself
up
to
strange
inclinations
for
a
moment
or
two
like
a
woman
such
was
the
shock
of
his
happiness
it
crept
in
a
living
fluid
through
his
flesh
she
saw
it
in
the
swift
change
of
the
color
in
his
face
and
his
quicker
breathing
and
was
a
little
amazed
but
alan
was
too
completely
possessed
by
the
one
great
thing
to
discover
the
astonishment
growing
in
her
eyes
you
are
alive
he
said
giving
voice
again
to
the
one
thought
pounding
in
his
brain
it
seemed
to
him
that
word
wanted
to
utter
itself
an
impossible
number
of
times
then
the
truth
that
was
partly
dawning
came
entirely
to
the
girl
holt
you
did
not
receive
my
letter
at
nome
she
asked
your
letter
at
nome
he
repeated
the
words
shaking
his
head
no
and
all
this
time
you
have
been
thinking
i
was
dead
he
nodded
because
the
thickness
in
his
throat
made
it
the
easier
form
of
speech
i
wrote
you
there
she
said
i
wrote
the
letter
before
i
jumped
into
the
sea
it
went
to
nome
with
captain
rifle
ship
i
did
get
it
you
did
get
it
there
was
wonderment
in
her
voice
and
then
if
he
had
observed
it
understanding
then
you
did
mean
that
just
now
you
did
intend
to
do
it
it
was
because
you
had
blamed
yourself
for
my
death
and
it
was
a
great
relief
to
find
me
alive
that
was
it
was
it
stupidly
he
nodded
again
yes
it
was
a
great
relief
you
see
i
had
faith
in
you
even
when
you
would
help
me
she
went
on
so
much
faith
that
i
trusted
you
with
my
secret
in
the
letter
i
wrote
to
all
the
world
but
you
i
am
dead
to
rossland
captain
rifle
everyone
in
my
letter
i
told
you
i
had
arranged
with
the
young
thlinkit
indian
he
smuggled
the
canoe
over
the
side
just
before
i
leaped
in
and
picked
me
up
i
am
a
good
swimmer
then
he
paddled
me
ashore
while
the
boats
were
making
their
search
in
a
moment
she
had
placed
a
gulf
between
them
again
on
the
other
side
of
which
she
stood
unattainable
it
was
inconceivable
that
only
a
few
moments
ago
he
had
crushed
her
in
his
arms
the
knowledge
that
he
had
done
this
thing
and
that
she
was
looking
at
him
now
as
if
it
had
never
happened
filled
him
with
a
smothering
sense
of
humiliation
she
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
speak
about
it
even
to
apologize
more
fully
now
i
am
here
she
was
saying
in
a
quiet
possessive
sort
of
way
i
did
think
of
coming
when
i
jumped
into
the
sea
i
made
up
my
mind
afterward
i
think
it
was
because
i
met
a
little
man
with
red
whiskers
whom
you
once
pointed
out
to
me
in
the
smoking
salon
on
the
and
so
i
am
your
guest
mr
holt
there
was
not
the
slightest
suspicion
of
apology
in
her
voice
as
she
smoothed
back
her
hair
where
he
had
crumpled
it
it
was
as
if
she
belonged
here
and
had
always
belonged
here
and
was
giving
him
permission
to
enter
her
domain
shock
was
beginning
to
pass
away
from
him
and
he
could
feel
his
feet
upon
the
earth
once
more
his
of
her
as
she
had
walked
hand
in
hand
with
him
during
the
past
weeks
her
soft
eyes
filled
with
love
faded
away
before
the
reality
of
mary
standish
in
flesh
and
blood
her
quiet
mastery
of
things
her
almost
omniscient
unapproachableness
he
reached
out
his
hands
but
there
was
a
different
light
in
his
eyes
and
she
placed
her
own
in
them
confidently
it
was
like
a
bolt
of
lightning
he
said
his
voice
free
at
last
and
trembling
day
and
night
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
dreaming
of
you
and
cursing
myself
because
i
believed
i
had
killed
you
and
now
i
find
you
alive
and
she
was
so
near
that
the
hands
he
clasped
lay
against
his
breast
but
reason
had
returned
to
him
and
he
saw
the
folly
of
dreams
it
is
difficult
to
believe
out
there
i
thought
i
was
sick
perhaps
i
am
but
if
i
am
not
sick
and
you
are
really
you
i
am
glad
if
i
wake
up
and
find
i
have
imagined
it
all
as
i
imagined
so
many
of
the
other
things
he
laughed
freeing
her
hands
and
looking
into
eyes
shining
half
out
of
tears
at
him
but
he
did
not
finish
she
drew
away
from
him
with
a
lingering
of
her
on
his
arm
and
the
little
in
her
throat
revealed
itself
clearly
again
as
on
that
night
in
his
cabin
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
back
there
every
hour
every
step
he
said
making
a
gesture
toward
the
tundras
over
which
he
had
come
then
i
heard
the
firecrackers
and
saw
the
flag
it
is
almost
as
if
i
had
created
you
a
quick
answer
was
on
her
lips
but
she
stopped
it
and
when
i
found
you
here
and
you
did
fade
away
like
a
ghost
i
thought
something
was
wrong
with
my
head
something
must
have
been
wrong
i
guess
or
i
would
have
done
you
see
it
puzzled
me
that
a
ghost
should
be
setting
off
firecrackers
and
i
suppose
that
was
the
first
impulse
i
had
of
making
sure
you
were
real
a
voice
came
from
the
edge
of
the
cottonwoods
beyond
them
it
was
a
clear
wild
voice
with
a
sweet
trill
in
it
it
called
supper
nodded
the
girl
you
are
just
in
time
and
then
we
are
going
home
in
the
twilight
it
made
his
heart
thump
that
casual
way
in
which
she
spoke
of
his
place
as
home
she
went
ahead
of
him
with
the
sun
glinting
in
the
soft
coils
of
her
hair
and
he
picked
up
his
rifle
and
followed
eyes
and
soul
filled
only
with
the
beauty
of
her
slim
figure
a
glory
of
life
where
for
a
long
time
he
had
fashioned
a
spirit
of
the
dead
they
came
into
an
open
soft
with
grass
and
strewn
with
flowers
and
in
this
open
a
man
was
kneeling
beside
a
fire
no
larger
than
his
two
hands
and
at
his
side
watching
him
stood
a
girl
with
two
braids
of
black
hair
rippling
down
her
back
it
was
nawadlook
who
turned
first
and
saw
who
it
was
with
mary
standish
and
from
his
right
came
an
odd
little
screech
that
only
one
person
in
the
world
could
make
and
that
was
keok
she
dropped
the
armful
of
sticks
she
had
gathered
for
the
fire
and
made
straight
for
him
while
nawadlook
taller
and
less
like
a
wild
creature
in
the
manner
of
her
coming
was
only
a
moment
behind
and
then
he
was
shaking
hands
with
stampede
and
keok
had
slipped
down
among
the
flowers
and
was
crying
that
was
like
keok
she
always
cried
when
he
went
away
and
cried
when
he
returned
and
then
in
another
moment
it
was
keok
who
was
laughing
first
and
alan
noticed
she
no
longer
wore
her
hair
in
braids
as
the
quieter
nawadlook
persisted
in
doing
but
had
it
coiled
about
her
head
just
as
mary
standish
wore
her
own
these
details
pressed
themselves
upon
him
in
a
vague
and
unreal
sort
of
way
no
one
not
even
mary
standish
could
understand
how
his
mind
and
nerves
were
fighting
to
recover
themselves
his
senses
were
swimming
back
one
by
one
to
a
vital
point
from
which
they
had
been
swept
by
an
unexpected
sea
gripping
rather
incoherently
at
unimportant
realities
as
they
assembled
themselves
in
the
edge
of
the
tundra
beyond
the
cottonwoods
he
noticed
three
grazing
at
the
ends
of
ropes
which
were
fastened
to
he
drew
off
his
pack
as
mary
standish
went
to
help
keok
pick
up
the
fallen
sticks
nawadlook
was
pulling
a
from
the
tiny
fire
stampede
began
to
fill
a
pipe
he
realized
that
because
they
had
expected
him
if
not
today
then
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
or
a
day
soon
after
that
no
one
had
experienced
shock
but
himself
and
with
a
mighty
effort
he
reached
back
and
dragged
the
old
alan
holt
into
existence
again
it
was
like
bringing
an
intelligence
out
of
darkness
into
light
it
was
difficult
for
him
afterward
to
remember
just
what
happened
during
the
next
the
amazing
thing
was
that
mary
standish
sat
opposite
him
with
the
cloth
on
which
nawadlook
had
spread
the
supper
things
between
them
and
that
she
was
the
same
beautiful
mary
standish
who
had
sat
across
the
table
from
him
in
the
of
the
not
until
later
when
he
stood
alone
with
stampede
smith
in
the
edge
of
the
cottonwoods
and
the
three
girls
were
riding
deer
back
over
the
tundra
in
the
direction
of
the
range
did
the
sea
of
questions
which
had
been
gathering
begin
to
sweep
upon
him
it
had
been
keok
suggestion
that
she
and
mary
and
nawadlook
ride
on
ahead
and
he
had
noticed
how
quickly
mary
standish
had
caught
at
the
idea
she
had
smiled
at
him
as
she
left
and
a
little
farther
out
had
waved
her
hand
at
him
as
keok
and
nawadlook
both
had
done
but
not
another
word
had
passed
between
them
alone
and
as
they
rode
off
in
the
warm
glow
of
sunset
alan
stood
watching
them
and
would
have
stared
without
speech
until
they
were
out
of
sight
if
stampede
fingers
had
not
gripped
his
arm
now
go
to
it
alan
he
said
i
ready
give
me
hell
chapter
xiv
it
was
thus
with
a
note
of
something
inevitable
in
his
voice
that
stampede
brought
alan
back
solidly
to
earth
there
was
a
practical
and
awakening
inspiration
in
the
manner
of
the
little
invitation
i
been
a
damn
fool
he
confessed
and
i
waiting
the
word
was
like
a
key
opening
a
door
through
which
a
flood
of
things
began
to
rush
in
upon
alan
there
were
other
fools
and
evidently
he
had
been
one
his
mind
went
back
to
the
it
seemed
only
a
few
hours
ago
only
yesterday
that
the
girl
had
so
artfully
deceived
them
all
and
he
had
gone
through
hell
because
of
that
deception
the
trickery
had
been
simple
and
exceedingly
clever
because
of
its
simplicity
it
must
have
taken
a
tremendous
amount
of
courage
now
that
he
clearly
understood
that
at
no
time
had
she
wanted
to
die
i
wonder
he
said
why
she
did
a
thing
like
that
stampede
shook
his
head
misunderstanding
what
was
in
alan
mind
i
could
keep
her
back
not
unless
i
tied
her
to
a
tree
and
he
added
the
little
witch
even
threatened
to
shoot
me
a
flash
of
exultant
humor
filled
his
eyes
begin
alan
i
waiting
go
the
limit
for
what
for
letting
her
ride
over
me
of
course
for
bringing
her
up
for
not
shufflin
her
in
the
bush
you
ca
take
it
out
of
hide
can
you
he
twisted
his
red
whiskers
waiting
for
an
answer
alan
was
silent
mary
standish
was
leading
the
way
up
out
of
a
dip
in
the
tundra
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
with
nawadlook
and
keok
close
behind
her
they
trotted
up
a
low
ridge
and
disappeared
it
none
of
my
business
persisted
stampede
but
you
did
seem
to
expect
her
you
right
interrupted
alan
turning
toward
his
pack
i
expect
her
i
thought
she
was
dead
a
low
whistle
escaped
stampede
lips
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
closed
it
again
alan
observed
him
as
he
slipped
the
pack
over
his
shoulders
evidently
his
companion
did
not
know
mary
standish
was
the
girl
who
had
jumped
overboard
from
the
and
if
she
had
kept
her
secret
it
was
not
his
business
just
now
to
explain
even
though
he
guessed
that
stampede
quick
wits
would
readily
jump
at
the
truth
a
light
was
beginning
to
dispel
the
little
man
bewilderment
as
they
started
toward
the
range
he
had
seen
mary
standish
frequently
aboard
the
a
number
of
times
he
had
observed
her
in
alan
company
and
he
knew
of
the
hours
they
had
spent
together
in
skagway
therefore
if
alan
had
believed
her
dead
when
they
went
ashore
at
cordova
a
few
hours
after
the
supposed
tragedy
it
must
have
been
she
who
jumped
into
the
sea
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
deprecation
of
his
failure
to
discover
this
amazing
fact
in
his
association
with
mary
standish
it
beats
the
devil
he
exclaimed
suddenly
it
does
agreed
alan
cold
hard
reason
began
to
shoulder
itself
inevitably
against
the
happiness
that
possessed
him
and
questions
which
he
had
found
no
interest
in
asking
when
aboard
ship
leaped
upon
him
with
compelling
force
why
was
it
so
tragically
important
to
mary
standish
that
the
world
should
believe
her
dead
what
was
it
that
had
driven
her
to
appeal
to
him
and
afterward
to
jump
into
the
sea
what
was
her
mysterious
association
with
rossland
an
agent
of
alaska
deadliest
enemy
john
graham
the
one
man
upon
whom
he
had
sworn
vengeance
if
opportunity
ever
came
his
way
over
him
clubbing
other
emotions
with
its
insistence
rode
a
demand
for
explanations
which
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
make
stampede
saw
the
tense
lines
in
his
face
and
remained
silent
in
the
lengthening
twilight
while
alan
mind
struggled
to
bring
coherence
and
reason
out
of
a
tidal
wave
of
mystery
and
doubt
why
had
she
come
to
cabin
aboard
the
why
had
she
played
him
with
such
conspicuous
intent
against
rossland
and
why
in
the
end
had
she
preceded
him
to
his
home
in
the
tundras
it
was
this
question
which
persisted
never
for
an
instant
swept
aside
by
the
others
she
had
not
come
because
of
love
for
him
in
a
brutal
sort
of
way
he
had
proved
that
for
when
he
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
he
had
seen
distress
and
fear
and
a
flash
of
horror
in
her
face
another
and
more
mysterious
force
had
driven
her
the
joy
in
him
was
a
living
flame
even
as
this
realization
pressed
upon
him
he
was
like
a
man
who
had
found
life
after
a
period
of
something
that
was
worse
than
death
and
with
his
happiness
he
felt
himself
twisted
upon
an
upheaval
of
conflicting
sensations
and
half
convictions
out
of
which
in
spite
of
his
effort
to
hold
it
back
suspicion
began
to
creep
like
a
shadow
but
it
was
not
the
sort
of
suspicion
to
cool
the
thrill
in
his
blood
or
frighten
him
for
he
was
quite
ready
to
concede
that
mary
standish
was
a
fugitive
and
that
her
flight
from
seattle
had
been
in
the
face
of
a
desperate
necessity
what
had
happened
aboard
ship
was
further
proof
and
her
presence
at
his
range
a
final
one
forces
had
driven
her
which
it
had
been
impossible
for
her
to
combat
and
in
desperation
she
had
come
to
him
for
refuge
she
had
chosen
him
out
of
all
the
world
to
help
her
she
believed
in
him
she
had
faith
that
with
him
no
harm
could
come
and
his
muscles
tightened
with
sudden
desire
to
fight
for
her
in
these
moments
he
became
conscious
of
the
evening
song
of
the
tundras
and
the
soft
splendor
of
the
miles
reaching
out
ahead
of
them
he
strained
his
eyes
to
catch
another
glimpse
of
the
mounted
figures
when
they
came
up
out
of
hollows
to
the
but
the
lacy
veils
of
evening
were
drawing
closer
and
he
looked
in
vain
grew
softer
sleepy
cries
rose
from
the
grasses
and
pools
the
fire
of
the
sun
itself
died
out
leaving
its
radiance
in
a
mingling
of
vivid
rose
and
mellow
gold
over
the
edge
of
the
world
it
was
night
and
yet
day
and
alan
wondered
what
thoughts
were
in
the
heart
of
mary
standish
what
had
driven
her
to
the
range
was
of
small
importance
compared
with
the
thrilling
fact
that
she
was
just
ahead
of
him
the
mystery
of
her
would
be
explained
tomorrow
he
was
sure
of
that
she
would
confide
in
him
now
that
she
had
so
utterly
placed
herself
under
his
protection
she
would
tell
him
what
she
had
not
dared
to
disclose
aboard
the
so
he
thought
only
of
the
silvery
distance
of
twilight
that
separated
them
and
spoke
at
last
to
stampede
i
rather
glad
you
brought
her
he
said
i
did
bring
her
protested
stampede
she
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
grunt
and
furthermore
i
did
manage
it
she
did
that
herself
she
did
come
with
me
i
came
with
he
stopped
and
struck
a
match
to
light
his
pipe
over
the
tiny
flame
he
glared
fiercely
at
alan
but
in
his
eyes
was
something
that
betrayed
him
alan
saw
it
and
felt
a
desire
to
laugh
out
of
sheer
happiness
his
keen
vision
and
sense
of
humor
were
returning
how
did
it
happen
stampede
puffed
loudly
at
his
pipe
then
took
it
from
his
mouth
and
drew
in
a
deep
breath
first
i
remember
was
the
fourth
night
after
we
landed
at
cordova
could
get
a
train
on
the
new
line
until
then
somewhere
up
near
chitina
we
came
to
a
washout
it
did
rain
you
could
call
it
that
alan
it
was
the
pacific
ocean
falling
on
us
with
two
or
three
other
oceans
backing
it
up
the
stage
came
along
horses
swimming
coach
floating
driver
half
drowned
in
his
seat
i
was
that
hungry
i
got
in
for
chitina
there
was
one
other
climbed
in
after
me
and
i
wondered
what
sort
of
fool
he
was
i
said
something
about
being
starved
or
have
hung
to
the
train
the
other
did
answer
then
i
began
to
swear
i
did
alan
i
cursed
terrible
swore
at
the
government
for
building
such
a
road
swore
at
the
rain
an
i
swore
at
myself
for
not
along
grub
i
said
my
belly
was
as
empty
as
a
cartridge
and
i
said
it
good
an
loud
i
was
mad
then
a
big
flash
of
lightning
lit
up
the
coach
alan
it
was
sittin
there
with
a
box
in
her
lap
facing
me
drippin
wet
her
eyes
shining
and
she
was
smiling
at
me
yessir
stampede
paused
to
let
the
shock
sink
in
he
was
not
disappointed
alan
stared
at
him
in
amazement
the
fourth
night
after
he
caught
himself
go
on
stampede
i
began
hunting
for
the
latch
on
the
door
alan
i
was
goin
to
sneak
out
drop
in
the
mud
disappear
before
the
lightnin
come
again
but
it
caught
me
an
there
she
was
undoing
the
box
and
i
heard
her
saying
she
had
plenty
of
good
stuff
to
eat
an
she
called
me
stampede
like
she
known
me
all
her
life
and
with
that
coach
rolling
an
rocking
and
the
thunder
an
lightning
an
rain
piling
up
against
each
other
like
sin
she
came
over
and
sat
down
beside
me
and
began
to
feed
me
she
did
that
alan
me
when
the
lightning
fired
up
i
could
see
her
eyes
shining
and
her
lips
smilin
as
if
all
that
hell
about
us
made
her
happy
and
i
thought
she
was
plumb
crazy
before
i
knew
it
she
was
telling
me
how
you
pointed
me
out
to
her
in
the
and
how
happy
she
was
that
i
was
goin
her
way
way
mind
you
alan
not
and
that
just
the
way
she
kept
me
goin
up
to
the
minute
you
hove
in
sight
back
there
in
the
cottonwoods
he
lighted
his
pipe
again
alan
how
the
devil
did
she
know
i
was
hitting
the
trail
for
your
place
she
did
replied
alan
but
she
did
she
said
that
meeting
with
me
in
the
coach
was
the
happiest
moment
of
her
life
because
was
on
her
way
up
to
your
range
and
i
be
such
jolly
good
company
for
her
good
them
were
the
words
she
used
when
i
asked
her
if
you
knew
she
was
coming
up
she
said
no
of
course
not
and
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
grand
surprise
said
it
was
possible
she
buy
your
range
and
she
wanted
to
look
it
over
before
you
arrived
an
it
seems
queer
i
ca
remember
anything
more
about
the
thunder
and
lightning
between
there
and
chitina
when
we
took
the
train
again
she
began
askin
a
million
questions
about
you
and
the
range
and
alaska
soak
me
if
you
want
to
alan
but
everything
i
knew
she
got
out
of
me
between
chitina
and
fairbanks
and
she
got
it
in
such
a
nice
way
that
i
have
eat
soap
out
of
her
hand
if
she
offered
it
to
me
then
sort
of
sly
and
she
began
asking
questions
about
john
graham
and
i
woke
up
john
graham
alan
repeated
the
name
yes
john
graham
and
i
had
a
lot
to
tell
after
that
i
tried
to
get
away
from
her
but
she
caught
me
just
as
i
was
sneakin
aboard
a
boat
and
cool
as
you
please
with
her
hand
on
my
arm
she
said
she
was
quite
ready
to
go
yet
and
would
i
please
come
and
help
her
carry
some
stuff
she
was
going
to
buy
alan
it
ai
a
lie
what
going
to
tell
you
she
led
me
up
the
street
telling
me
what
a
wonderful
idea
she
had
for
surprisin
said
she
knew
you
would
return
to
the
range
by
the
fourth
of
july
and
we
sure
must
have
some
fireworks
said
you
was
such
a
good
american
you
be
disappointed
if
you
did
have
so
she
took
me
in
a
store
an
bought
it
out
asked
the
man
what
he
take
for
everything
in
his
joint
that
had
powder
in
it
five
hundred
dollars
that
was
what
she
paid
she
pulled
a
silk
something
out
of
the
front
of
her
dress
with
a
pad
of
bills
in
it
an
inch
think
then
she
asked
to
get
them
firecrackers
wheels
skyrockets
balloons
other
stuff
down
to
the
boat
and
she
asked
me
just
as
if
i
was
a
sweet
little
boy
who
be
tickled
to
death
to
do
it
in
the
excitement
of
unburdening
himself
of
a
matter
which
he
had
borne
in
secret
for
many
days
stampede
did
not
observe
the
effect
of
his
words
upon
his
companion
incredulity
shot
into
alan
eyes
and
the
humorous
lines
about
his
mouth
vanished
when
he
saw
clearly
that
stampede
was
not
drawing
upon
his
imagination
yet
what
he
had
told
him
seemed
impossible
mary
standish
had
come
aboard
the
a
fugitive
all
her
possessions
she
had
brought
with
her
in
a
small
and
these
things
she
had
left
in
her
cabin
when
she
leaped
into
the
sea
how
then
could
she
logically
have
had
such
a
sum
of
money
at
fairbanks
as
stampede
described
was
it
possible
the
thlinkit
indian
had
also
become
her
agent
in
transporting
the
money
ashore
on
the
night
she
played
her
desperate
game
by
making
the
world
believe
she
had
died
and
was
this
money
possibly
the
manner
in
which
she
had
secured
it
in
seattle
the
cause
of
her
flight
and
the
clever
scheme
she
had
put
into
execution
a
little
later
he
had
been
thinking
crime
and
his
face
grew
hot
at
the
sin
of
it
it
was
like
thinking
it
of
another
woman
who
was
dead
and
whose
name
was
cut
under
his
father
in
the
old
cottonwood
tree
stampede
having
gained
his
wind
was
saying
you
do
seem
interested
alan
but
i
going
on
or
i
bust
i
got
to
tell
you
what
happened
and
then
if
you
want
to
lead
me
out
and
shoot
me
i
say
a
word
i
say
curse
a
firecracker
anyway
go
on
urged
alan
i
interested
i
got
on
the
boat
continued
stampede
viciously
and
she
with
me
every
minute
smiling
in
that
angel
way
of
hers
and
not
letting
me
out
of
her
sight
a
flick
of
her
eyelash
unless
there
was
only
one
hole
to
go
in
an
come
out
at
and
then
she
said
she
wanted
to
do
a
little
shopping
which
meant
going
into
every
shack
in
town
and
something
an
i
did
the
lugging
at
last
she
bought
a
gun
and
when
i
asked
her
what
she
was
goin
to
do
with
it
she
said
for
you
an
when
i
went
to
thank
her
she
said
i
do
mean
it
that
way
i
mean
that
if
you
try
to
run
away
from
me
again
i
going
to
fill
you
full
of
holes
she
said
that
threatened
me
then
she
bought
me
a
new
outfit
from
toe
to
summit
boots
pants
shirt
hat
a
necktie
and
i
did
say
a
word
not
a
word
she
just
led
me
in
bought
what
she
wanted
and
made
me
put
on
stampede
drew
in
a
mighty
breath
and
a
fourth
time
wasted
a
match
on
his
pipe
i
was
getting
used
to
it
by
the
time
we
reached
tanana
he
half
groaned
then
the
hell
of
it
begun
she
hired
six
indians
to
tote
the
luggage
and
we
set
out
over
the
trail
for
your
place
goin
to
have
a
rest
stampede
she
says
to
me
smiling
so
cool
and
sweet
like
you
wanted
to
eat
her
alive
you
got
to
do
is
show
us
the
way
and
carry
the
bums
the
what
i
asks
bums
she
says
an
then
she
explains
that
a
bum
is
a
thing
filled
with
powder
which
makes
a
terrible
racket
when
it
goes
off
so
i
took
the
bums
and
the
next
day
one
of
the
indians
sprained
a
leg
and
dropped
out
he
had
the
firecrackers
pretty
near
a
hundred
pounds
and
we
whacked
up
his
load
among
us
i
could
stand
up
straight
when
we
camped
we
had
crooks
in
our
backs
every
inch
of
the
way
to
the
range
and
she
let
us
cache
some
of
that
junk
not
on
your
life
she
would
and
all
the
time
while
they
was
puffing
an
panting
them
indians
was
her
with
their
eyes
the
last
day
when
we
camped
with
the
range
almost
in
sight
she
drew
all
up
in
a
circle
about
her
and
gave
each
a
handful
of
money
above
their
pay
because
i
love
you
she
says
and
then
she
begins
asking
them
funny
questions
did
they
have
wives
and
children
were
they
ever
hungry
did
they
ever
know
about
any
of
their
people
starving
to
death
and
just
did
they
starve
and
alan
so
help
me
thunder
if
them
indians
did
talk
never
heard
indians
tell
so
much
and
in
the
end
she
asked
them
the
funniest
question
of
all
asked
them
if
they
heard
of
a
man
named
john
graham
one
of
them
had
and
afterward
i
saw
her
talking
a
long
time
with
him
alone
and
when
she
come
back
to
me
her
eyes
were
sort
of
burning
up
and
she
did
say
good
night
when
she
went
into
her
tent
that
all
alan
except
except
what
stampede
said
alan
his
heart
throbbing
like
a
drum
inside
him
stampede
took
his
time
to
answer
and
alan
heard
him
chuckling
and
saw
a
flash
of
humor
in
the
little
man
eyes
except
that
she
done
with
everyone
on
the
range
just
what
she
did
with
me
between
chitina
and
here
he
said
alan
if
she
wants
to
say
the
word
why

boss

more
that
all

days

he
chuckled
again
why
the
men
even
go
to
the
sunday
school
started
i
went
nawadlook
sings
for
a
moment
he
was
silent
then
he
said
in
a
subdued
voice
alan

big
fool

it
stampede

a
flower

but

too
late
now
i
warnin
you

because
she

stampede
a
bit
fiercely
i
after
her
myself
alan
you

now
great
scott
gasped
alan

that
mary
standish
i
not
talking
about
mary
standish
said
stampede
it
nawadlook
if
it
was
for
my
whiskers
his
words
were
broken
by
a
sudden
detonation
which
came
out
of
the
pale
gloom
ahead
of
them
it
was
like
the
explosion
of
a
cannon
a
long
distance
away
one
of
them
cussed
bums
he
explained
that
why
they
hurried
on
ahead
of
us
alan
says
this
fourth
of
july
celebration
is
going
to
mean
a
lot
for
alaska
wonder
what
she
means
i
wonder
said
alan
chapter
xv
half
an
hour
more
of
the
tundra
and
they
came
to
what
alan
had
named
ghost
kloof
a
deep
and
jagged
scar
in
the
face
of
the
earth
running
down
from
the
foothills
of
the
mountains
it
was
a
sinister
thing
and
in
the
depths
lay
abysmal
darkness
as
they
descended
a
rocky
path
worn
smooth
by
reindeer
and
caribou
hoofs
at
the
bottom
a
hundred
feet
below
the
twilight
of
the
plains
alan
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
a
little
spring
that
he
groped
for
among
the
stones
and
as
he
drank
he
could
hear
the
weird
whispering
and
gurgling
of
water
up
and
down
the
kloof
choked
and
smothered
in
the
moss
of
the
rock
walls
and
eternally
dripping
from
the
crevices
then
he
saw
stampede
face
in
the
glow
of
another
match
and
the
little
man
eyes
were
staring
into
the
black
chasm
that
reached
for
miles
up
into
the
mountains
alan
you
been
up
this
gorge
it
a
favorite
runway
for
the
lynx
and
big
brown
bears
that
kill
our
fawns
replied
alan
i
hunt
alone
stampede
the
place
is
supposed
to
be
haunted
you
know
ghost
kloof
i
call
it
and
no
eskimo
will
enter
it
the
bones
of
dead
men
lie
up
there
never
prospected
it
persisted
stampede
never
alan
heard
the
other
grunt
of
disgust
you
he
grumbled
there
gold
in
this
canyon
twice
i
found
it
where
there
were
dead
men
bones
they
bring
me
good
luck
but
these
were
eskimos
they
did
come
for
gold
i
know
it
the
boss
settled
that
for
me
when
she
heard
what
was
the
matter
with
this
place
she
made
me
take
her
into
it
nerve
say
telling
you
there
was
any
of
it
left
out
of
her
when
she
was
born
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
added
when
we
came
to
that
dripping
slimy
rock
with
the
big
yellow
skull
layin
there
like
a
poison
toadstool
she
did
screech
and
pull
back
but
just
gave
a
little
gasp
and
stared
at
it
hard
and
her
fingers
pinched
my
arm
until
it
hurt
it
was
a
thing
yellow
as
a
sick
orange
and
soppy
with
the
drip
of
the
wet
moss
over
it
i
wanted
to
blow
it
to
pieces
and
i
guess
i
would
if
she
had
put
a
hand
on
my
gun
an
with
a
funny
little
smile
she
says
do
it
stampede
it
makes
me
think
of
someone
i
know
and
i
would
want
you
to
shoot
him
darned
funny
thing
to
say
was
it
made
her
think
of
someone
she
knew
now
who
the
devil
could
look
like
a
rotten
skull
alan
made
no
effort
to
reply
except
to
shrug
his
shoulders
they
climbed
up
out
of
gloom
into
the
light
of
the
plain
smoothness
of
the
tundra
was
gone
on
this
side
of
the
crevasse
ahead
of
them
rolled
up
a
low
hill
and
mountainward
hills
piled
one
upon
another
until
they
were
lost
in
misty
distance
from
the
crest
of
the
ridge
they
looked
out
into
a
vast
sweep
of
tundra
which
ran
in
among
the
billows
and
hills
of
the
endicott
mountains
in
the
form
of
a
wide
semicircular
bay
beyond
the
next
swell
in
the
tundra
lay
the
range
and
scarcely
had
they
reached
this
when
stampede
drew
his
big
gun
from
its
holster
twice
he
blazed
in
the
air
orders
he
said
a
little
sheepishly
orders
alan
scarcely
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
a
yell
came
to
them
from
beyond
the
that
hovered
like
floating
lace
over
the
tundra
it
was
joined
by
another
and
still
another
until
there
was
such
a
sound
that
alan
knew
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
and
topkok
and
tatpan
and
all
the
others
were
splitting
their
throats
in
welcome
and
with
it
very
soon
came
a
series
of
explosions
that
set
the
earth
athrill
under
their
feet
bums
growled
stampede
she
got
chink
lanterns
hanging
up
all
about
too
you
should
have
seen
her
face
alan
when
she
found
there
was
sunlight
all
night
up
here
on
july
fourth
from
the
range
a
pale
streak
went
sizzling
into
the
air
mounting
until
it
seemed
to
pause
for
a
moment
to
look
down
upon
the
gray
world
then
burst
into
innumerable
little
balls
of
puffy
smoke
stampede
blazed
away
with
his
and
alan
felt
the
thrill
of
it
and
emptied
the
magazine
of
his
gun
the
detonations
of
revolver
and
rifle
drowning
the
chorus
of
sound
that
came
from
the
range
a
second
rocket
answered
them
two
columns
of
flame
leaped
up
from
the
earth
as
huge
fires
gained
headway
and
alan
could
hear
the
shrill
chorus
of
children
voices
mingling
with
the
vocal
tumult
of
men
all
the
people
of
his
range
were
there
they
had
come
in
from
the
plateaux
and
high
ranges
where
the
herds
were
feeding
and
from
the
outlying
shacks
of
the
tundras
to
greet
him
never
had
there
been
such
a
concentration
of
effort
on
the
part
of
his
people
and
mary
standish
was
behind
it
all
he
knew
he
was
fighting
against
odds
when
he
tried
to
keep
that
fact
from
choking
up
his
heart
a
little
he
had
not
heard
what
stampede
was
saying
that
he
and
amuk
toolik
and
forty
kids
had
labored
a
week
gathering
dry
moss
and
timber
fuel
for
the
big
fires
there
were
three
of
these
fires
now
and
the
were
booming
their
hollow
notes
over
the
tundra
as
alan
quickened
his
steps
over
a
little
knoll
and
he
was
looking
at
the
buildings
of
the
range
wildly
excited
figures
running
about
women
and
children
flinging
moss
on
the
fires
the
beaters
squatted
in
a
facing
the
direction
from
which
he
would
come
and
fifty
chinese
lanterns
swinging
in
the
soft
he
knew
what
they
were
expecting
of
him
for
they
were
children
all
of
them
even
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
his
chief
herdsmen
were
children
nawadlook
and
keok
were
children
strong
and
loyal
and
ready
to
die
for
him
in
any
fight
or
stress
they
were
still
children
he
gave
stampede
his
rifle
and
hastened
on
determined
to
keep
his
eyes
from
questing
for
mary
standish
in
these
first
minutes
of
his
return
he
sounded
the
tundra
call
and
men
women
and
little
children
came
running
to
meet
him
the
drumming
of
the
ceased
and
the
beaters
leaped
to
their
feet
he
was
inundated
there
was
a
shrill
crackling
of
voice
laughter
children
squeals
a
babel
of
delight
he
gripped
hands
with
both
his
own
hard
thick
brown
hands
of
men
little
softer
brown
hands
of
women
he
lifted
children
up
in
his
arms
slapped
his
palm
affectionately
against
the
men
shoulders
and
talked
talked
talked
calling
each
by
name
without
a
slip
of
memory
though
there
were
fifty
around
him
counting
the
children
first
last
and
always
these
were
the
old
pride
swept
over
him
a
compelling
sense
of
power
and
possession
they
loved
him
crowding
in
about
him
like
a
great
family
and
he
shook
hands
twice
and
three
times
with
the
same
men
and
women
and
lifted
the
same
children
from
the
arms
of
delighted
mothers
and
cried
out
greetings
and
familiarities
with
an
abandon
which
a
few
minutes
ago
knowledge
of
mary
standish
presence
would
have
tempered
then
suddenly
he
saw
her
under
the
chinese
lanterns
in
front
of
his
cabin
sokwenna
so
old
that
he
hobbled
double
and
looked
like
a
witch
stood
beside
her
in
a
moment
sokwenna
head
disappeared
and
there
came
the
booming
of
a
as
quickly
as
the
crowd
had
gathered
about
him
it
fell
away
the
beaters
squatted
themselves
in
their
semicircle
again
fireworks
began
to
go
off
dancers
assembled
rockets
hissed
through
the
air
roman
candles
popped
from
the
open
door
of
his
cabin
came
the
sound
of
a
phonograph
it
was
aimed
directly
at
him
the
one
thing
intended
for
his
understanding
alone
it
was
playing
when
johnny
comes
marching
home
mary
standish
had
not
moved
he
saw
her
laughing
at
him
and
she
was
alone
she
was
not
the
mary
standish
he
had
known
aboard
ship
fear
the
quiet
pallor
of
her
face
and
the
strain
and
repression
which
had
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
her
were
gone
she
was
aflame
with
life
yet
it
was
not
with
voice
or
action
that
she
revealed
herself
it
was
in
her
eyes
the
flush
of
her
cheeks
and
lips
the
poise
of
her
slim
body
as
she
waited
for
him
a
thought
flashed
upon
him
that
for
a
space
she
had
forgotten
herself
and
the
shadow
which
had
driven
her
to
leap
into
the
sea
it
is
splendid
she
said
when
he
came
up
to
her
and
her
voice
trembled
a
little
i
did
guess
how
badly
they
wanted
you
back
it
must
be
a
great
happiness
to
have
people
think
of
you
like
that
and
i
thank
you
for
your
part
he
replied
stampede
has
told
me
it
was
quite
a
bit
of
trouble
was
it
with
nothing
more
than
the
hope
of
americanizing
a
pagan
to
inspire
you
he
nodded
at
the
flags
over
his
cabin
they
rather
pretty
it
was
no
trouble
and
i
hope
you
do
mind
it
has
been
great
fun
he
tried
to
look
casually
out
upon
his
people
as
he
answered
her
it
seemed
to
him
there
was
only
one
thing
to
say
and
that
it
was
a
duty
to
speak
what
was
in
his
mind
calmly
and
without
emotion
yes
i
do
mind
he
said
i
mind
so
much
that
i
would
trade
what
has
happened
for
all
the
gold
in
these
mountains
i
sorry
because
of
what
happened
back
in
the
cottonwoods
but
i
would
trade
that
either
i
glad
you
alive
i
glad
you
here
but
something
is
missing
you
know
what
it
is
you
must
tell
me
about
yourself
it
is
the
only
fair
thing
for
you
to
do
now
she
touched
his
arm
with
her
hand
let
us
wait
for
tomorrow
please
let
us
wait
and
then
tomorrow
it
is
your
right
to
question
me
and
send
me
back
if
i
am
not
welcome
but
not
tonight
all
this
is
too
fine
just
you
and
your
people
and
their
happiness
he
bent
his
head
to
catch
her
words
almost
drowned
by
the
hissing
of
a
and
the
popping
of
firecrackers
she
nodded
toward
the
buildings
beyond
his
cabin
i
am
with
keok
and
nawadlook
they
have
given
me
a
home
and
then
swiftly
she
added
i
do
think
you
love
your
people
more
than
i
do
alan
holt
nawadlook
was
approaching
and
with
a
lingering
touch
of
her
fingers
on
his
arm
she
drew
away
from
him
his
face
did
not
show
his
disappointment
nor
did
he
make
a
movement
to
keep
her
with
him
your
people
are
expecting
things
of
you
she
said
a
little
later
if
you
ask
me
i
may
dance
with
you
to
the
music
of
the
he
watched
her
as
she
went
away
with
nawadlook
she
looked
back
at
him
and
smiled
and
there
was
something
in
her
face
which
set
his
heart
beating
faster
she
had
been
afraid
aboard
the
ship
but
she
was
not
afraid
of
tomorrow
thought
of
it
and
the
questions
he
would
ask
did
not
frighten
her
and
a
happiness
which
he
had
persistently
held
away
from
himself
triumphed
in
a
sudden
submerging
flood
it
was
as
if
something
in
her
eyes
and
voice
had
promised
him
that
the
dreams
he
had
dreamed
through
weeks
of
torture
and
living
death
were
coming
true
and
that
possibly
in
her
ride
over
the
tundra
that
night
she
had
come
a
little
nearer
to
the
truth
of
what
those
weeks
had
meant
to
him
surely
he
would
never
quite
be
able
to
tell
her
and
what
she
said
to
him
tomorrow
would
in
the
end
make
little
difference
she
was
alive
and
he
could
not
let
her
go
away
from
him
again
he
joined
the
beaters
and
the
dancers
it
rather
amazed
him
to
discover
himself
doing
things
which
he
had
never
done
before
his
nature
was
an
aloof
one
observing
and
sympathetic
but
always
more
or
less
detached
at
his
people
dances
it
was
his
habit
to
stand
on
the
smiling
and
nodding
encouragement
but
never
taking
a
part
his
habit
of
reserve
fell
from
him
now
and
he
seemed
possessed
of
a
new
sense
of
freedom
and
a
new
desire
to
give
physical
expression
to
something
within
him
stampede
was
dancing
he
was
kicking
his
feet
and
howling
with
the
men
while
the
women
dancers
went
through
the
muscular
movements
of
arms
and
bodies
a
chorus
of
voices
invited
alan
they
had
always
invited
him
and
tonight
he
accepted
and
took
his
place
between
stampede
and
amuk
toolik
and
the
beaters
almost
burst
their
instruments
in
their
excitement
not
until
he
dropped
out
half
breathless
did
he
see
mary
standish
and
keok
in
the
outer
circle
keok
was
frankly
amazed
mary
standish
eyes
were
shining
and
she
clapped
her
hands
when
she
saw
that
he
had
observed
her
he
tried
to
laugh
and
waved
his
hand
but
he
felt
too
foolish
to
go
to
her
and
then
the
balloon
went
up
a
big
balloon
and
with
all
its
fire
made
only
a
pale
glow
in
the
sky
and
after
another
hour
of
and
asking
of
questions
about
health
and
domestic
matters
alan
went
to
his
cabin
he
looked
about
the
one
big
room
that
was
his
and
it
never
had
seemed
quite
so
comforting
as
now
at
first
he
thought
it
was
as
he
had
left
it
for
there
was
his
desk
where
it
should
be
the
big
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
same
pictures
on
the
walls
his
filled
with
polished
weapons
his
pipes
the
rugs
on
the
floor
and
then
one
at
a
time
he
began
to
observe
things
that
were
different
in
place
of
dark
shades
there
were
soft
curtains
at
his
windows
and
new
covers
on
his
table
and
the
couch
in
the
corner
on
his
desk
were
two
pictures
in
frames
one
of
george
washington
and
the
other
of
abraham
lincoln
and
behind
them
crisscrossed
against
the
wall
just
over
the
top
of
the
desk
were
four
tiny
american
flags
they
recalled
alan
mind
to
the
evening
aboard
the
when
mary
standish
had
challenged
his
assertion
that
he
was
an
alaskan
and
not
an
american
only
she
would
have
thought
of
those
two
pictures
and
the
little
flags
there
were
flowers
in
his
room
and
she
had
placed
them
there
she
must
have
picked
fresh
flowers
each
day
and
kept
them
waiting
the
hour
of
his
coming
and
she
had
thought
of
him
in
tanana
where
she
had
purchased
the
cloth
for
the
curtains
and
the
covers
he
went
into
his
bedroom
and
found
new
curtains
at
the
window
a
new
coverlet
on
his
bed
and
a
pair
of
red
morocco
slippers
that
he
had
never
seen
before
he
took
them
up
in
his
hands
and
laughed
when
he
saw
how
she
had
misjudged
the
size
of
his
feet
in
the
he
sat
down
and
lighted
his
pipe
observing
that
keok
phonograph
which
had
been
there
earlier
in
the
evening
was
gone
outside
the
noise
of
the
celebration
died
away
and
the
growing
stillness
drew
him
to
the
window
from
which
he
could
see
the
cabin
where
lived
keok
and
nawadlook
with
their
the
old
and
shriveled
sokwenna
it
was
there
mary
standish
had
said
she
was
staying
for
a
long
time
alan
watched
it
while
the
final
sounds
of
the
night
drifted
away
into
utter
silence
it
was
a
knock
at
his
door
that
turned
him
about
at
last
and
in
answer
to
his
invitation
stampede
came
in
he
nodded
and
sat
down
shiftingly
his
eyes
traveled
about
the
room
been
a
fine
night
alan
everybody
glad
to
see
you
they
seemed
to
be
i
happy
to
be
home
again
mary
standish
did
a
lot
she
fixed
up
this
room
i
guessed
as
much
replied
alan
of
course
keok
and
nawadlook
helped
her
not
very
much
she
did
it
made
the
curtains
put
them
pictures
and
flags
there
picked
the
flowers
been
nice
an
thoughtful
has
she
and
somewhat
unusual
added
alan
and
she
is
pretty
most
decidedly
so
there
was
a
puzzling
look
in
stampede
eyes
he
twisted
nervously
in
his
chair
and
waited
for
words
alan
sat
down
opposite
him
what
on
your
mind
stampede
hell
mostly
shot
back
stampede
with
sudden
desperation
i
come
loaded
down
with
a
dirty
job
and
i
kept
it
back
this
long
because
i
did
want
to
spoil
your
fun
tonight
i
guess
a
man
ought
to
keep
to
himself
what
he
knows
about
a
woman
but
i
thinking
this
is
a
little
different
i
hate
to
do
it
i
rather
take
the
chance
of
a
but
you
shoot
me
if
you
knew
i
was
keeping
it
to
myself
keeping
what
to
yourself
the
truth
alan
it
up
to
me
to
tell
you
what
i
know
about
this
young
woman
who
calls
herself
mary
standish
chapter
xvi
the
physical
sign
of
strain
in
stampede
face
and
the
stolid
effort
he
was
making
to
say
something
which
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
put
into
words
did
not
excite
alan
as
he
waited
for
his
companion
promised
disclosure
instead
of
suspense
he
felt
rather
a
sense
of
anticipation
and
relief
what
he
had
passed
through
recently
had
burned
out
of
him
a
certain
demand
upon
human
ethics
which
had
been
almost
callous
in
its
insistence
and
while
he
believed
that
something
very
real
and
very
stern
in
the
way
of
necessity
had
driven
mary
standish
north
he
was
now
anxious
to
be
given
the
privilege
of
gripping
with
any
force
of
circumstance
that
had
turned
against
her
he
wanted
to
know
the
truth
yet
he
had
dreaded
the
moment
when
the
girl
herself
must
tell
it
to
him
and
the
fact
that
stampede
had
in
some
way
discovered
this
truth
and
was
about
to
make
disclosure
of
it
was
a
tremendous
lightening
of
the
situation
go
on
he
said
at
last
what
do
you
know
about
mary
standish
stampede
leaned
over
the
table
a
gleam
of
distress
in
his
eyes
rotten
i
know
it
a
man
who
backslides
on
a
woman
the
way
i
goin
to
oughta
be
shot
and
if
it
was
anything
else
i
keep
it
to
myself
but
you
got
to
know
and
you
ca
understand
just
how
rotten
it
is
either
you
have
ridden
in
a
coach
with
her
during
a
storm
that
was
blowing
the
pacific
outa
bed
an
you
have
hit
the
trail
with
her
all
the
way
from
chitina
to
the
range
as
i
did
if
you
done
that
alan
you
feel
like
killing
a
man
who
said
anything
against
her
i
not
inquiring
into
your
personal
affairs
reminded
alan
your
own
business
that
the
trouble
protested
stampede
it
not
my
business
yours
if
i
guessed
the
truth
before
we
hit
the
range
everything
would
have
been
different
i
have
rid
myself
of
her
some
way
but
i
did
find
out
what
she
was
until
this
evening
when
i
returned
music
machine
to
their
cabin
i
been
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
ever
since
if
she
was
only
making
her
from
the
states
a
pickpocket
a
coiner
somebody
bunco
pigeon
chased
by
the
police
almost
anything
we
could
forgive
her
even
if
she
shot
up
somebody
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair
but
she
did
she
worse
than
that
he
leaned
a
little
nearer
to
alan
she
one
of
john
graham
tools
sent
up
here
to
sneak
and
spy
on
you
he
finished
desperately
i
sorry
but
i
got
the
proof
his
hand
crept
over
the
top
of
the
table
slowly
the
closed
palm
opened
and
when
he
drew
it
back
a
crumpled
paper
lay
between
them
found
it
on
the
floor
when
i
took
the
phonograph
back
he
explained
it
was
twisted
up
hard
do
know
why
i
unrolled
it
just
chance
he
waited
until
alan
had
read
the
few
words
on
the
bit
of
paper
watching
closely
the
slight
tensing
of
the
other
face
after
a
moment
alan
dropped
the
paper
rose
to
his
feet
and
went
to
the
window
there
was
no
longer
a
light
in
the
cabin
where
mary
standish
had
been
accepted
as
a
guest
stampede
too
had
risen
from
his
seat
he
saw
the
sudden
and
almost
imperceptible
shrug
of
alan
shoulders
it
was
alan
who
spoke
after
a
of
silence
rather
a
missing
link
is
it
adds
up
a
number
of
things
fairly
well
and
grateful
to
you
stampede
almost
you
did
tell
me
almost
admitted
stampede
and
i
would
have
blamed
you
she
that
kind
the
kind
that
makes
you
feel
anything
said
against
her
is
a
lie
and
i
going
to
believe
that
paper
is
a
lie
until
tomorrow
will
you
take
a
message
to
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
when
you
go
out
i
having
breakfast
at
seven
tell
them
to
come
to
my
cabin
with
their
reports
and
records
at
eight
later
i
going
up
into
the
foothills
to
look
over
the
herds
stampede
nodded
it
was
a
good
fight
on
alan
part
and
it
was
just
the
way
he
had
expected
him
to
take
the
matter
it
made
him
rather
ashamed
of
the
weakness
and
uncertainty
to
which
he
had
confessed
of
course
they
could
do
nothing
with
a
woman
it
was
a
shooting
business
yet
but
there
was
a
debatable
future
if
the
gist
of
the
note
on
the
table
ran
true
to
their
unspoken
analysis
of
it
promise
of
something
like
that
was
in
alan
eyes
he
opened
the
door
i
have
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
here
at
eight
good
night
alan
good
night
alan
watched
stampede
figure
until
it
had
disappeared
before
he
closed
the
door
now
that
he
was
alone
he
no
longer
made
an
effort
to
restrain
the
anxiety
which
the
prospector
unexpected
revealment
had
aroused
in
him
the
other
footsteps
were
scarcely
gone
when
he
again
had
the
paper
in
his
hand
it
was
clearly
the
lower
part
of
a
letter
sheet
of
ordinary
business
size
and
had
been
carelessly
torn
from
the
larger
part
of
the
page
so
that
nothing
more
than
the
signature
and
half
a
dozen
lines
of
writing
in
a
man
heavy
script
remained
what
was
left
of
the
letter
which
alan
would
have
given
much
to
have
possessed
read
as
follows
if
you
work
carefully
and
guard
your
real
identity
in
securing
facts
and
information
we
should
have
the
entire
industry
in
our
hands
within
a
under
these
words
was
the
strong
and
unmistakable
signature
of
john
graham
a
score
of
times
alan
had
seen
that
signature
and
the
hatred
he
bore
for
its
maker
and
the
desire
for
vengeance
which
had
entwined
itself
like
a
fibrous
plant
through
all
his
plans
for
the
future
had
made
of
it
an
unforgetable
writing
in
his
brain
now
that
he
held
in
his
hand
words
written
by
his
enemy
and
the
man
who
had
been
his
father
enemy
all
that
he
had
kept
away
from
stampede
sharp
eyes
blazed
in
a
sudden
fury
in
his
face
he
dropped
the
paper
as
if
it
had
been
a
thing
unclean
and
his
hands
clenched
until
his
knuckles
snapped
in
the
stillness
of
the
room
as
he
slowly
faced
the
window
through
which
a
few
moments
ago
he
had
looked
in
the
direction
of
mary
standish
cabin
so
john
graham
was
keeping
his
promise
the
deadly
promise
he
had
made
in
the
one
hour
of
his
father
triumph
that
hour
in
which
the
elder
holt
might
have
rid
the
earth
of
a
serpent
if
his
hands
had
not
revolted
in
the
last
of
those
terrific
minutes
which
he
as
a
youth
had
witnessed
and
mary
standish
was
the
instrument
he
had
chosen
to
work
his
ends
in
these
first
minutes
alan
could
not
find
a
doubt
with
which
to
fend
the
absoluteness
of
the
convictions
which
were
raging
in
his
head
or
still
the
tumult
that
was
in
his
heart
and
blood
he
made
no
pretense
to
deny
the
fact
that
john
graham
must
have
written
this
letter
to
mary
standish
inadvertently
she
had
kept
it
had
finally
attempted
to
destroy
it
and
stampede
by
chance
had
discovered
a
small
but
convincing
remnant
of
it
in
a
whirlwind
of
thought
he
pieced
together
things
that
had
happened
her
efforts
to
interest
him
from
the
beginning
the
determination
with
which
she
had
held
to
her
purpose
her
boldness
in
following
him
to
the
range
and
her
apparent
endeavor
to
work
herself
into
his
confidence
and
with
john
graham
signature
staring
at
him
from
the
table
these
things
seemed
conclusive
and
irrefutable
evidence
the
industry
which
graham
had
referred
to
could
mean
only
his
own
and
carl
lomen
the
reindeer
industry
which
they
had
built
up
and
were
fighting
to
perpetuate
and
which
graham
and
his
friends
were
combining
to
handicap
and
destroy
and
in
this
game
of
destruction
clever
mary
standish
had
come
to
play
a
part
why
had
she
leaped
into
the
sea
it
was
as
if
a
new
voice
had
made
itself
heard
in
alan
brain
a
voice
that
rose
insistently
over
a
vast
tumult
of
things
crying
out
against
his
arguments
and
demanding
order
and
reason
in
place
of
the
mad
convictions
that
possessed
him
if
mary
standish
mission
was
to
pave
the
way
for
his
ruin
and
if
she
was
john
graham
agent
sent
for
that
purpose
what
reason
could
she
have
had
for
so
dramatically
attempting
to
give
the
world
the
impression
that
she
had
ended
her
life
at
sea
surely
such
an
act
could
in
no
way
have
been
related
with
any
plot
which
she
might
have
had
against
him
in
building
up
this
structure
of
her
defense
he
made
no
effort
to
sever
her
relationship
with
john
graham
that
he
knew
was
impossible
the
note
her
actions
and
many
of
the
things
she
had
said
were
links
inevitably
associating
her
with
his
enemy
but
these
same
things
now
that
they
came
pressing
one
upon
another
in
his
memory
gave
to
their
collusion
a
new
significance
was
it
conceivable
that
mary
standish
instead
of
working
for
john
graham
was
working
him
could
some
conflict
between
them
have
been
the
reason
for
her
flight
aboard
the
and
was
it
because
she
discovered
rossland
there
john
graham
most
trusted
servant
that
she
formed
her
desperate
scheme
of
leaping
into
the
sea
between
the
two
oppositions
of
his
thought
a
sickening
burden
of
what
he
knew
to
be
true
settled
upon
him
mary
standish
even
if
she
hated
john
graham
now
had
at
one
time
and
not
very
long
ago
been
an
instrument
of
his
trust
the
letter
he
had
written
to
her
was
positive
proof
of
that
what
it
was
that
had
caused
a
possible
split
between
them
and
had
inspired
her
flight
from
seattle
and
later
her
effort
to
bury
a
past
under
the
fraud
of
a
death
he
might
never
learn
and
just
now
he
had
no
very
great
desire
to
look
entirely
into
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
it
was
enough
to
know
that
of
the
past
and
of
the
things
that
happened
she
had
been
afraid
and
it
was
in
the
desperation
of
this
fear
with
graham
cleverest
agent
at
her
heels
that
she
had
appealed
to
him
in
his
cabin
and
failing
to
win
him
to
her
assistance
had
taken
the
matter
so
dramatically
into
her
own
hands
and
within
that
same
hour
a
nearly
successful
attempt
had
been
made
upon
life
of
course
the
facts
had
shown
that
she
could
not
have
been
directly
responsible
for
his
injury
but
it
was
a
haunting
thing
to
remember
as
happening
almost
simultaneously
with
her
disappearance
into
the
sea
he
drew
away
from
the
window
and
opening
the
door
went
out
into
the
night
cool
breaths
of
air
gave
a
crinkly
rattle
to
the
swinging
paper
lanterns
and
he
could
hear
the
soft
whipping
of
the
flags
which
mary
standish
had
placed
over
his
cabin
there
was
something
comforting
in
the
sound
a
solace
to
the
dishevelment
of
nerves
he
had
suffered
a
reminder
of
their
day
in
skagway
when
she
had
walked
at
his
side
with
her
hand
resting
warmly
in
his
arm
and
her
eyes
and
face
filled
with
the
inspiration
of
the
mountains
no
matter
what
she
was
or
had
been
there
was
something
tenaciously
admirable
about
her
a
quality
which
had
risen
even
above
her
feminine
loveliness
she
had
proved
herself
not
only
clever
she
was
inspired
by
courage
a
courage
which
he
would
have
been
compelled
to
respect
even
in
a
man
like
john
graham
and
in
this
slim
and
fragile
girl
it
appealed
to
him
as
a
virtue
to
be
laid
up
apart
and
aside
from
any
of
the
motives
which
might
be
directing
it
from
the
beginning
it
had
been
a
bewildering
part
of
her
a
clean
swift
unhesitating
courage
that
had
leaped
bounds
where
his
own
volition
and
judgment
would
have
hung
waveringly
that
one
courage
in
all
the
world
a
woman
courage
which
finds
in
the
effort
of
its
achievement
no
obstacle
too
high
and
no
abyss
too
wide
though
death
waits
with
outreaching
arms
on
the
other
side
and
surely
where
there
had
been
all
this
there
must
also
have
been
some
deeper
and
finer
impulse
than
one
of
destruction
of
physical
gain
or
of
mere
duty
in
the
weaving
of
a
human
scheme
the
thought
and
the
desire
to
believe
brought
words
half
aloud
from
alan
lips
as
he
looked
up
again
at
the
flags
beating
softly
above
his
cabin
mary
standish
was
not
what
stampede
discovery
had
proclaimed
her
to
be
there
was
some
mistake
a
monumental
stupidity
of
reasoning
on
their
part
and
tomorrow
would
reveal
the
littleness
and
the
injustice
of
their
suspicions
he
tried
to
force
the
conviction
upon
himself
and
reentering
the
cabin
he
went
to
bed
still
telling
himself
that
a
great
lie
had
built
itself
up
out
of
nothing
and
that
the
god
of
all
things
was
good
to
him
because
mary
standish
was
alive
and
not
dead
chapter
xvii
alan
slept
soundly
for
several
hours
but
the
long
strain
of
the
preceding
day
did
not
make
him
overreach
the
time
he
had
set
for
himself
and
he
was
up
at
six
wegaruk
had
not
forgotten
her
old
habits
and
a
tub
filled
with
cold
water
was
waiting
for
him
he
bathed
shaved
himself
put
on
fresh
clothes
and
promptly
at
seven
was
at
breakfast
the
table
at
which
he
ordinarily
sat
alone
was
in
a
little
room
with
double
windows
through
which
as
he
enjoyed
his
meals
he
could
see
most
of
the
habitations
of
the
range
unlike
the
average
eskimo
dwellings
they
were
neatly
built
of
small
timber
brought
down
from
the
mountains
and
were
arranged
in
orderly
fashion
like
the
cottages
of
a
village
strung
out
prettily
on
a
single
street
a
sea
of
flowers
lay
in
front
of
them
and
at
the
end
of
the
row
built
on
a
little
knoll
that
looked
down
into
one
of
the
watered
hollows
of
the
tundra
was
sokwenna
cabin
because
sokwenna
was
the
old
man
of
the
community
and
therefore
the
wisest
and
because
with
him
lived
his
keok
and
nawadlook
the
loveliest
of
alan
tribal
colony
sokwenna
cabin
was
next
to
alan
in
size
and
alan
looking
at
it
now
and
then
as
he
ate
his
breakfast
saw
a
thin
spiral
of
smoke
rising
from
the
chimney
but
no
other
sign
of
life
the
sun
was
already
up
almost
to
its
highest
point
a
little
more
than
between
the
horizon
and
the
zenith
performing
the
apparent
miracle
of
rising
in
the
north
and
traveling
east
instead
of
west
alan
knew
the
of
the
village
had
departed
hours
ago
for
the
distant
herds
always
when
the
reindeer
drifted
into
the
higher
and
cooler
of
the
foothills
there
was
this
apparent
abandonment
and
after
last
night
celebration
the
women
and
children
were
not
yet
awake
to
the
activities
of
the
long
day
where
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
meant
so
little
as
he
rose
from
the
table
he
glanced
again
toward
sokwenna
cabin
a
solitary
figure
had
climbed
up
out
of
the
ravine
and
stood
against
the
sun
on
the
even
at
that
distance
with
the
sun
in
his
eyes
he
knew
it
was
mary
standish
he
turned
his
back
stoically
to
the
window
and
lighted
his
pipe
for
half
an
hour
after
that
he
sorted
out
his
papers
and
in
preparation
for
the
coming
of
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
and
when
they
arrived
the
minute
hand
of
his
watch
was
at
the
hour
of
eight
that
the
months
of
his
absence
had
been
prosperous
ones
he
perceived
by
the
smiling
eagerness
in
the
brown
faces
of
his
companions
as
they
spread
out
the
papers
on
which
they
had
in
their
own
crude
fashion
set
down
a
record
of
the
winter
happenings
tautuk
voice
slow
and
very
deliberate
in
its
unfailing
effort
to
master
english
without
a
slip
had
in
it
a
subdued
note
of
satisfaction
and
triumph
while
amuk
toolik
who
was
quick
and
staccato
in
his
manner
of
speech
using
sentences
seldom
of
greater
length
than
three
or
four
words
and
who
picked
up
slang
and
like
a
parrot
swelled
with
pride
as
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
then
rubbed
his
hands
with
a
rasping
sound
that
always
sent
a
chill
up
alan
back
a
ver
fine
and
prosper
year
said
tautuk
in
response
to
alan
first
question
as
to
general
conditions

this

after
this
opening
of

alan
buried
himself
in
the
affairs
of
the
range
and
the
old
thrill
the
glow
which
comes
through
achievement
and
the
pioneer
pride
in
marking
a
new
frontier
with
the
creative
forces
of
success
rose
uppermost
in
him
and
he
forgot
the
passing
of
time
a
hundred
questions
he
had
to
ask
and
the
tongues
of
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
were
crowded
with
the
things
they
desired
to
tell
him
their
voices
filled
the
room
with
a
paean
of
triumph
his
herds
had
increased
by
a
thousand
head
during
the
fawning
months
of
april
and
may
and
interbreeding
of
the
asiatic
stock
with
wild
woodland
caribou
had
produced
a
hundred
calves
of
the
whose
flesh
was
bound
to
fill
the
markets
of
the
states
within
a
few
years
never
had
the
moss
been
thicker
under
the
winter
snow
there
had
been
no
destructive
fires
had
escaped
them
breeding
records
had
been
beaten
and
dairying
in
the
edge
of
the
arctic
was
no
longer
an
experiment
but
an
established
fact
for
tautuk
now
had
seven
deer
giving
a
pint
and
a
half
of
milk
each
twice
a
day
nearly
as
rich
as
the
best
of
cream
from
cattle
and
more
than
twenty
that
were
delivering
from
a
cupful
to
a
pint
at
a
milking
and
to
this
amuk
toolik
added
the
amazing
record
of
their
kauk
the
had
drawn
a
sledge
five
miles
over
unbeaten
snow
in
thirteen
minutes
and
seconds
kauk
and
olo
in
team
had
drawn
the
same
sledge
ten
miles
in
minutes
and
forty
seconds
and
one
day
he
had
driven
the
two
miles
in
a
mighty
endurance
test
and
with
eno
and
sutka
the
first
of
their
with
the
wild
woodland
caribou
and
heavier
beasts
he
had
drawn
a
load
of
eight
hundred
pounds
for
three
consecutive
days
at
the
rate
of
forty
miles
a
day
from
fairbanks
tanana
and
the
ranges
of
the
seward
peninsula
agents
of
the
swiftly
spreading
industry
had
offered
as
high
as
a
hundred
and
ten
dollars
a
head
for
breeding
stock
with
the
blood
of
the
woodland
caribou
and
of
these
native
and
larger
caribou
of
the
tundras
and
forests
seven
young
bulls
and
nine
female
calves
had
been
captured
and
added
to
their
own
propagative
forces
for
alan
this
was
triumph
he
saw
nothing
of
what
it
all
meant
in
the
way
of
ultimate
personal
fortune
it
was
the
earth
under
his
feet
the
vast
expanse
of
unpeopled
waste
traduced
and
scorned
in
the
blindness
of
a
hundred
million
people
which
he
saw
fighting
itself
on
the
glory
and
reward
of
the
conqueror
through
such
achievement
as
this
a
land
betrayed
rising
at
last
out
of
the
slime
of
political
greed
and
ignorance
a
giant
irresistible
in
its
awakening
that
was
destined
in
his
lifetime
to
rock
the
destiny
of
a
continent
it
was
alaska
rising
up
slowly
but
inexorably
out
of
its
eternity
of
sleep
forces
of
a
great
land
that
was
once
the
cradle
of
the
earth
coming
into
possession
of
life
and
power
again
and
his
own
feeble
efforts
in
that
long
and
fighting
process
of
planting
the
seeds
which
meant
its
ultimate
ascendancy
possessed
in
themselves
their
own
reward
long
after
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
had
gone
his
heart
was
filled
with
the
song
of
success
he
was
surprised
at
the
swiftness
with
which
time
had
gone
when
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
almost
dinner
hour
when
he
had
finished
with
his
papers
and
books
and
went
outside
he
heard
wegaruk
voice
coming
from
the
dark
mouth
of
the
underground
icebox
dug
into
the
frozen
subsoil
of
the
tundra
and
pausing
at
the
glimmer
of
his
old
housekeeper
candle
he
turned
aside
descended
the
few
steps
and
entered
quietly
into
the
big
square
chamber
eight
feet
under
the
surface
where
the
earth
had
remained
steadfastly
frozen
for
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
wegaruk
had
a
habit
of
talking
when
alone
but
alan
thought
it
odd
that
she
should
be
explaining
to
herself
that
the
in
spite
of
its
almost
tropical
summer
richness
and
luxuriance
never
thawed
deeper
than
three
or
four
feet
below
which
point
remained
the
icy
cold
placed
there
so
long
ago
that
even
the
spirits
did
not
know
he
smiled
when
he
heard
wegaruk
measuring
time
and
faith
in
terms
of
spirits
which
she
had
never
quite
given
up
for
the
missionaries
and
was
about
to
make
his
presence
known
when
a
voice
interrupted
him
so
close
at
his
side
that
the
speaker
concealed
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
could
have
reached
out
a
hand
and
touched
him
good
morning
mr
holt
it
was
mary
standish
and
he
stared
rather
foolishly
to
make
her
out
in
the
gloom
good
morning
he
replied
i
was
on
my
way
to
your
place
when
wegaruk
voice
brought
me
here
you
see
even
this
icebox
seems
like
a
friend
after
my
experience
in
the
states
are
you
after
a
steak
mammy
he
called
wegaruk
strong
squat
figure
turned
as
she
answered
him
and
the
light
from
her
candle
glowing
brightly
in
a
split
tomato
can
fell
clearly
upon
mary
standish
as
the
old
woman
waddled
toward
them
it
was
as
if
a
spotlight
had
been
thrown
upon
the
girl
suddenly
out
of
a
pit
of
darkness
and
something
about
her
which
was
not
her
prettiness
or
the
beauty
that
was
in
her
eyes
and
hair
sent
a
sudden
and
unaccountable
thrill
through
alan
it
remained
with
him
when
they
drew
back
out
of
gloom
and
chill
into
sunshine
and
warmth
leaving
wegaruk
to
snuff
her
lantern
and
follow
with
the
steak
and
it
did
not
leave
him
when
they
walked
over
the
tundra
together
toward
sokwenna
cabin
it
was
a
puzzling
thrill
stirring
an
emotion
which
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
subdue
or
explain
something
which
he
knew
he
should
understand
but
could
not
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
knowledge
of
this
mystery
was
in
the
girl
face
glowing
in
a
gentle
embarrassment
as
she
told
him
she
had
been
expecting
him
and
that
keok
and
nawadlook
had
given
up
the
cabin
to
them
so
that
he
might
question
her
uninterrupted
but
with
this
soft
flush
of
her
uneasiness
revealing
itself
in
her
eyes
and
cheeks
he
saw
neither
fear
nor
hesitation
in
the
big
room
of
sokwenna
cabin
which
was
patterned
after
his
own
he
sat
down
amid
the
color
and
delicate
fragrance
of
masses
of
flowers
and
the
girl
seated
herself
near
him
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
you
love
flowers
he
said
lamely
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
flowers
you
placed
in
my
cabin
and
the
other
things
flowers
are
a
habit
with
me
she
replied
and
i
have
never
seen
such
flowers
as
these
flowers
and
birds
i
never
dreamed
that
there
were
so
many
up
here
nor
the
world
he
added
it
is
ignorant
of
alaska
he
was
looking
at
her
trying
to
understand
the
inexplicable
something
about
her
she
knew
what
was
in
his
mind
because
the
strangely
thrilling
emotion
that
possessed
him
could
not
keep
its
betrayal
from
his
eyes
the
color
was
fading
slowly
out
of
her
cheeks
her
lips
grew
a
little
tense
yet
in
her
attitude
of
suspense
and
of
waiting
there
was
no
longer
a
suspicion
of
embarrassment
no
trace
of
fear
and
no
sign
that
a
moment
was
at
hand
when
her
confidence
was
on
the
ebb
in
this
moment
alan
did
not
think
of
john
graham
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
like
a
child
again
the
child
who
had
come
to
him
in
his
cabin
and
who
had
stood
with
her
back
against
his
cabin
door
entreating
him
to
achieve
the
impossible
an
angel
almost
with
her
smooth
shining
hair
her
clear
beautiful
eyes
her
white
throat
which
waited
with
its
little
for
him
to
beat
down
the
fragile
defense
which
now
lay
in
the
greater
power
of
his
own
hands
the
inequality
of
it
and
the
pitilessness
of
what
had
been
in
his
mind
to
say
and
do
together
with
an
inundating
sense
of
his
own
brute
mastery
swept
over
him
and
in
sudden
desperation
he
reached
out
his
hands
toward
her
and
cried
mary
standish
in
god
name
tell
me
the
truth
tell
me
why
you
have
come
up
here
i
have
come
she
said
looking
at
him
steadily
because
i
know
that
a
man
like
you
when
he
loves
a
woman
will
fight
for
her
and
protect
her
even
though
he
may
not
possess
her
but
you
did
know
that
not
until
the
cottonwoods
he
protested
yes
i
did
i
knew
it
in
ellen
mccormick
cabin
she
rose
slowly
before
him
and
he
too
rose
to
his
feet
staring
at
her
like
a
man
who
had
been
struck
while
intelligence
a
dawning
reason
an
understanding
of
the
strange
mystery
of
her
that
morning
sent
the
still
greater
thrill
of
its
shock
through
him
he
gave
an
exclamation
of
amazement
you
were
at
ellen
mccormick
she
gave
you
she
nodded
yes
the
dress
you
brought
from
the
ship
please
scold
me
holt
be
a
little
kind
with
me
when
you
have
heard
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
i
was
in
the
cabin
that
last
day
when
you
returned
from
searching
for
me
in
the
sea
mccormick
did
know
but
did
i
lied
a
little
just
a
little
so
that
she
being
a
woman
would
promise
not
to
tell
you
i
was
there
you
see
i
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
my
faith
and
my
courage
was
about
gone
and
i
was
afraid
of
you
afraid
of
me
yes
afraid
of
everybody
i
was
in
the
room
behind
ellen
mccormick
when
she
asked
you
that
question
and
when
you
answered
as
you
did
i
was
like
stone
i
was
amazed
and
did
believe
for
i
was
certain
that
after
what
had
happened
on
the
ship
you
despised
me
and
only
through
a
peculiar
sense
of
honor
were
making
the
search
for
me
not
until
two
days
later
when
your
letters
came
to
ellen
mccormick
and
we
read
them
you
opened
both
of
course
one
was
to
be
read
immediately
the
other
when
i
was
found
and
i
had
found
myself
maybe
it
was
exactly
fair
but
you
could
expect
two
women
to
resist
a
temptation
like
that
and
wanted
to
she
did
not
lower
her
eyes
or
turn
her
head
aside
as
she
made
the
confession
her
gaze
met
alan
with
beautiful
steadiness
and
then
i
believed
i
knew
because
of
what
you
said
in
that
letter
that
you
were
the
one
man
in
all
the
world
who
would
help
me
and
give
me
a
fighting
chance
if
i
came
to
you
but
it
has
taken
all
my
courage
and
in
the
end
you
will
drive
me
away
again
he
looked
upon
the
miracle
of
tears
in
unfaltering
eyes
tears
which
she
did
not
brush
away
but
through
which
in
a
moment
she
smiled
at
him
as
no
woman
had
ever
smiled
at
him
before
and
with
the
tears
there
seemed
to
possess
her
a
pride
which
lifted
her
above
all
confusion
a
living
spirit
of
will
and
courage
and
womanhood
that
broke
away
the
dark
clouds
of
suspicion
and
fear
that
had
gathered
in
his
mind
he
tried
to
speak
and
his
lips
were
thick
you
have
come
because
you
know
i
love
you
and
you
because
from
the
beginning
it
must
have
been
a
great
faith
in
you
that
inspired
me
alan
holt
there
must
have
been
more
than
that
he
persisted
some
other
reason
two
she
acknowledged
and
now
he
noticed
that
with
the
dissolution
of
tears
a
flush
of
color
was
returning
into
her
cheeks
and
those
one
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
know
the
other
if
i
tell
you
will
make
you
despise
me
i
am
sure
of
that
it
has
to
do
with
john
graham
she
bowed
her
head
yes
with
john
graham
for
the
first
time
long
lashes
hid
her
eyes
from
him
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
her
resolution
was
gone
and
she
stood
stricken
by
the
import
of
the
thing
that
lay
behind
his
question
yet
her
cheeks
flamed
red
instead
of
paling
and
when
she
looked
at
him
again
her
eyes
burned
with
a
lustrous
fire
john
graham
she
repeated
the
man
you
hate
and
want
to
kill
slowly
he
turned
toward
the
door
i
am
leaving
immediately
after
dinner
to
inspect
the
herds
up
in
the
foothills
he
said
and
you
welcome
he
caught
the
swift
intake
of
her
breath
as
he
paused
for
an
instant
at
the
door
and
saw
the
new
light
that
leaped
into
her
eyes
thank
you
alan
holt
she
cried
softly
i
thank
you
and
then
suddenly
she
stopped
him
with
a
little
cry
as
if
at
last
something
had
broken
away
from
her
control
he
faced
her
and
for
a
moment
they
stood
in
silence
i
sorry
sorry
i
said
to
you
what
i
did
that
night
on
the
she
said
i
accused
you
of
brutality
of
unfairness
of
of
even
worse
than
that
and
i
want
to
take
it
all
back
you
are
big
and
clean
and
splendid
for
you
would
go
away
now
knowing
i
am
poisoned
by
an
association
with
the
man
who
has
injured
you
so
terribly
you
say
i
am
welcome
and
i
do
want
you
to
go
you
have
made
me
to
tell
you
who
i
am
and
why
i
have
come
to
you
and
i
pray
god
you
will
think
as
kindly
of
me
as
you
can
when
you
have
heard
chapter
xviii
it
seemed
to
alan
that
in
an
instant
a
sudden
change
had
come
over
the
world
there
was
silence
in
the
cabin
except
for
the
breath
which
came
like
a
sob
to
the
girl
lips
as
she
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
blaze
of
golden
sunlight
that
filled
the
tundra
he
heard
tautuk
voice
calling
to
keok
away
over
near
the
reindeer
corral
and
he
heard
clearly
keok
merry
laughter
as
she
answered
him
a
thrush
flew
up
to
the
roof
of
sokwenna
cabin
and
began
to
sing
it
was
as
if
these
things
had
come
as
a
message
to
both
of
them
relieving
a
tension
and
significant
of
the
beauty
and
glory
and
undying
hope
of
life
mary
standish
turned
from
the
window
with
shining
eyes
every
day
the
thrush
comes
and
sings
on
our
cabin
roof
she
said
it
is
possibly
because
you
are
here
he
replied
she
regarded
him
seriously
i
have
thought
of
that
you
know
i
have
faith
in
a
great
many
unbelievable
things
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
beautiful
than
the
spirit
that
lives
in
the
heart
of
a
bird
i
am
sure
if
i
were
dying
i
would
like
to
have
a
bird
singing
near
me
hopelessness
can
not
be
so
deep
that
will
not
reach
it
he
nodded
trying
to
answer
in
that
way
he
felt
uncomfortable
she
closed
the
door
which
he
had
left
partly
open
and
made
a
little
gesture
for
him
to
resume
the
chair
which
he
had
left
a
few
moments
before
she
seated
herself
first
and
smiled
at
him
wistfully
half
regretfully
as
she
said
i
have
been
very
foolish
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
now
i
should
have
told
you
aboard
the
but
i
was
afraid
now
i
am
not
afraid
but
ashamed
terribly
ashamed
to
let
you
know
the
truth
and
yet
i
am
not
sorry
it
happened
so
because
otherwise
i
would
not
have
come
up
here
and
all
this
your
world
your
people
and
you
have
meant
a
great
deal
to
me
you
will
understand
when
i
have
made
my
confession
no
i
do
want
that
he
protested
almost
roughly
i
do
want
you
to
put
it
that
way
if
i
can
help
you
and
if
you
wish
to
tell
me
as
a
friend
that
different
i
do
want
a
confession
which
would
imply
that
i
have
no
faith
in
you
and
you
have
faith
in
me
yes
so
much
that
the
sun
will
darken
and
never
seem
the
same
if
i
lose
you
again
as
i
thought
i
had
lost
you
from
the
ship
oh
mean
the
words
came
from
her
in
a
strange
tense
little
cry
and
he
seemed
to
see
only
her
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
face
pale
as
the
petals
of
the
tundra
daises
behind
her
with
the
thrill
of
what
he
had
dared
to
say
tugging
at
his
heart
he
wondered
why
she
was
so
white
you
mean
that
her
lips
repeated
slowly
after
all
that
has
happened
even
after
that
part
of
a
letter
which
stampede
brought
to
you
last
night
he
was
surprised
how
had
she
discovered
what
he
thought
was
a
secret
between
himself
and
stampede
his
mind
leaped
to
a
conclusion
and
she
saw
it
written
in
his
face
no
it
was
stampede
she
said
he
did
tell
me
it
just
happened
and
after
this
letter
you
still
believe
in
me
i
must
i
should
be
unhappy
if
i
did
not
and
i
am
most
perversely
hoping
for
happiness
i
have
told
myself
that
what
i
saw
over
john
graham
signature
was
a
lie
it
was
that
quite
but
it
did
refer
to
you
or
to
me
it
was
part
of
a
letter
written
to
rossland
he
sent
me
some
books
while
i
was
on
the
ship
and
inadvertently
left
a
page
of
this
letter
in
one
of
them
as
a
marker
it
was
really
quite
unimportant
when
one
read
the
whole
of
it
the
other
half
of
the
page
is
in
the
toe
of
the
slipper
which
you
did
not
return
to
ellen
mccormick
you
know
that
is
the
conventional
thing
for
a
woman
to
do
to
use
paper
for
padding
in
a
slipper
he
wanted
to
shout
he
wanted
to
throw
up
his
arms
and
laugh
as
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
and
a
score
of
others
had
laughed
to
the
beat
of
the
last
night
not
because
he
was
amused
but
out
of
sheer
happiness
but
mary
standish
voice
continuing
in
its
quiet
and
way
held
him
speechless
though
she
could
not
fail
to
see
the
effect
upon
him
of
this
simple
explanation
of
the
presence
of
graham
letter
i
was
in
nawadlook
room
when
i
saw
stampede
pick
up
the
wad
of
paper
from
the
floor
she
was
saying
i
was
looking
at
the
slipper
a
few
minutes
before
regretting
that
you
had
left
its
mate
in
my
cabin
on
the
ship
and
the
paper
must
have
dropped
then
i
saw
stampede
read
it
and
the
shock
that
came
in
his
face
then
he
placed
it
on
the
table
and
went
out
i
hurried
to
see
what
he
had
found
and
had
scarcely
read
the
few
words
when
i
heard
him
returning
i
returned
the
paper
where
he
had
laid
it
hid
myself
in
nawadlook
room
and
saw
stampede
when
he
carried
it
to
you
i
do
know
why
i
allowed
it
to
be
done
i
had
no
reason
maybe
it
was
just
intuition
and
maybe
it
was
because
just
in
that
hour
i
so
hated
myself
that
i
wanted
someone
to
flay
me
alive
and
i
thought
that
what
stampede
had
found
would
make
you
do
it
and
i
deserve
it
i
deserve
nothing
better
at
your
hands
but
it
is
true
he
protested
the
letter
was
to
rossland
there
was
no
responsive
gladness
in
her
eyes
better
that
it
were
true
and
all
that
true
were
false
she
said
in
a
quiet
hopeless
voice
i
would
almost
give
my
life
to
be
no
more
than
what
those
words
implied
dishonest
a
spy
a
criminal
of
a
sort
almost
any
alternative
would
i
accept
in
place
of
what
i
actually
am
do
you
begin
to
understand
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
even
as
he
persisted
in
denial
the
pain
which
had
grown
like
velvety
dew
in
her
eyes
clutched
at
his
heart
and
he
felt
dread
of
what
lay
behind
it
i
understand
only
that
i
am
glad
you
are
here
more
glad
than
yesterday
or
this
morning
or
an
hour
ago
she
bowed
her
head
so
that
the
bright
light
of
day
made
a
radiance
of
rich
color
in
her
hair
and
he
saw
the
sudden
tremble
of
the
shining
lashes
that
lay
against
her
cheeks
and
then
quickly
she
caught
her
breath
and
her
hands
grew
steady
in
her
lap
would
you
mind
if
i
asked
you
first
to
tell
me
story
of
john
graham
she
spoke
softly
i
know
it
a
little
but
i
think
it
would
make
everything
easier
if
i
could
hear
it
from
you
now
he
stood
up
and
looked
down
upon
her
where
she
sat
with
the
light
playing
in
her
hair
and
then
he
moved
to
the
window
and
back
and
she
had
not
changed
her
position
but
was
waiting
for
him
to
speak
she
raised
her
eyes
and
the
question
her
lips
had
formed
was
glowing
in
them
as
clearly
as
if
she
had
voiced
it
again
in
words
a
desire
rose
in
him
to
speak
to
her
as
he
had
never
spoken
to
another
human
being
and
to
reveal
for
her
and
for
her
alone
the
thing
that
had
harbored
itself
in
his
soul
for
many
years
looking
up
at
him
waiting
partial
understanding
softening
her
sweet
face
a
dusky
glow
in
her
eyes
she
was
so
beautiful
that
he
cried
out
softly
and
then
laughed
in
a
strange
repressed
sort
of
way
as
he
half
held
out
his
arms
toward
her
i
think
i
know
how
my
father
must
have
loved
my
mother
he
said
but
i
ca
make
you
feel
it
i
ca
hope
for
that
she
died
when
i
was
so
young
that
she
remained
only
as
a
beautiful
dream
for
me
but
for
my
father
she
died
and
as
i
grew
older
she
became
more
and
more
alive
for
me
so
that
in
our
journeys
we
would
talk
about
her
as
if
she
were
waiting
for
us
back
home
and
would
welcome
us
when
we
returned
and
never
could
my
father
remain
away
from
the
place
where
she
was
buried
very
long
at
a
time
he
called
it
that
little
cup
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
with
the
waterfall
singing
in
summer
and
a
paradise
of
birds
and
flowers
keeping
her
company
and
all
the
great
wild
world
she
loved
about
her
there
was
the
cabin
too
the
little
cabin
where
i
was
born
with
its
back
to
the
big
mountain
and
filled
with
the
handiwork
of
my
mother
as
she
had
left
it
when
she
died
and
my
father
too
used
to
laugh
and
sing
there
he
had
a
clear
voice
that
would
roll
up
the
mountain
and
as
i
grew
older
the
miracle
at
times
stirred
me
with
a
strange
fear
so
real
to
my
father
did
my
dead
mother
seem
when
he
was
home
but
you
look
frightened
miss
standish
oh
it
may
seem
weird
and
ghostly
now
but
it
was
so
true
that
i
have
lain
awake
nights
thinking
of
it
and
wishing
that
it
had
never
been
so
then
you
have
wished
a
great
sin
said
the
girl
in
a
voice
that
seemed
scarcely
to
whisper
between
her
parted
lips
i
hope
someone
will
feel
toward
me
some
day
like
that
but
it
was
this
which
brought
the
tragedy
the
thing
you
have
asked
me
to
tell
you
about
he
said
unclenching
his
hands
slowly
and
then
tightening
them
again
until
the
blood
ebbed
from
their
veins
interests
were
coming
in
the
tentacles
of
power
and
greed
were
reaching
out
encroaching
steadily
a
little
nearer
to
our
cup
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
but
my
father
did
not
dream
of
what
might
happen
it
came
in
the
spring
of
the
year
he
took
me
on
my
first
trip
to
the
states
when
i
was
eighteen
we
were
gone
five
months
and
they
were
five
months
of
hell
for
him
day
and
night
he
grieved
for
my
mother
and
the
little
home
under
the
mountain
and
when
at
last
we
came
back
he
turned
again
to
the
window
but
he
did
not
see
the
golden
sun
of
the
tundra
or
hear
tautuk
calling
from
the
corral
when
we
came
back
he
repeated
in
a
cold
hard
voice
a
construction
camp
of
a
hundred
men
had
invaded
my
father
little
paradise
the
cabin
was
gone
a
channel
had
been
cut
from
the
waterfall
and
this
channel
ran
where
my
mother
grave
had
been
they
had
treated
it
with
that
same
desecration
with
which
they
have
destroyed
ten
thousand
indian
graves
since
then
her
bones
were
scattered
in
the
sand
and
mud
and
from
the
moment
my
father
saw
what
had
happened
never
another
sun
rose
in
the
heavens
for
him
his
heart
died
yet
he
went
on
living
for
a
time
mary
standish
had
bowed
her
face
in
her
hands
he
saw
the
tremor
of
her
slim
shoulders
and
when
he
came
back
and
she
looked
up
at
him
it
was
as
if
he
beheld
the
pallid
beauty
of
one
of
the
white
tundra
flowers
and
the
man
who
committed
that
crime
was
john
graham
she
said
in
the
strangely
passionless
voice
of
one
who
knew
what
his
answer
would
be
yes
john
graham
he
was
there
representing
big
interests
in
the
states
the
foreman
had
objected
to
what
happened
many
of
the
men
had
protested
a
few
of
them
who
knew
my
father
had
thrown
up
their
work
rather
than
be
partners
to
that
crime
but
graham
had
the
legal
power
they
say
he
laughed
as
if
he
thought
it
a
great
joke
that
a
cabin
and
a
grave
should
be
considered
obstacles
in
his
way
and
he
laughed
when
my
father
and
i
went
to
see
him
yes
in
that
noiseless
oily
inside
way
of
his
as
you
might
think
of
a
snake
laughing
we
found
him
among
the
men
my
god
you
do
know
how
i
hated
him
big
loose
powerful
dangling
the
that
hung
over
his
vest
and
looking
at
my
father
in
that
way
as
he
told
him
what
a
fool
he
was
to
think
a
worthless
grave
should
interfere
with
his
work
i
wanted
to
kill
him
but
my
father
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
a
quiet
steady
hand
and
said
is
my
duty
alan
and
then
it
happened
my
father
was
older
much
older
than
graham
but
god
put
such
strength
in
him
that
day
as
i
had
never
seen
before
and
with
his
naked
hands
he
would
have
killed
the
brute
if
i
had
not
unlocked
them
with
my
own
before
all
his
men
graham
became
a
mass
of
helpless
pulp
and
from
the
ground
with
the
last
of
the
breath
that
was
in
him
he
cursed
my
father
and
he
cursed
me
he
said
that
all
the
days
of
his
life
he
would
follow
us
until
we
paid
a
thousand
times
for
what
we
had
done
and
then
my
father
dragged
him
as
he
would
have
dragged
a
rat
to
the
edge
of
a
piece
of
bush
and
there
he
tore
his
clothes
from
him
until
the
brute
was
naked
and
in
that
nakedness
he
scourged
him
with
whips
until
his
arms
were
weak
and
john
graham
was
unconscious
and
like
a
great
hulk
of
raw
beef
when
it
was
over
we
went
into
the
mountains
during
the
terrible
recital
mary
standish
had
not
looked
away
from
him
and
now
her
hands
were
clenched
like
his
own
and
her
eyes
and
face
were
aflame
as
if
she
wanted
to
leap
up
and
strike
at
something
unseen
between
them
and
after
that
alan
after
that
she
did
not
know
that
she
had
spoken
his
name
and
he
hearing
it
scarcely
understood
john
graham
kept
his
promise
he
answered
grimly
the
influence
and
money
behind
him
haunted
us
wherever
we
went
my
father
had
been
successful
but
one
after
another
the
properties
in
which
he
was
interested
were
made
worthless
a
successful
mine
in
which
he
was
most
heavily
interested
was
allowed
to
become
abandoned
a
hotel
which
he
partly
owned
in
dawson
was
bankrupted
one
after
another
things
happened
and
after
each
happening
my
father
would
receive
a
polite
note
of
regret
from
graham
written
as
if
the
word
actually
came
from
a
friend
but
my
father
cared
little
for
money
losses
now
his
heart
was
drying
up
and
his
life
ebbing
away
for
the
little
cabin
and
the
grave
that
were
gone
from
the
foot
of
the
mountain
it
went
on
this
way
for
three
years
and
then
one
morning
my
father
was
found
on
the
beach
at
nome
dead
alan
heard
only
the
gasping
breath
in
which
the
word
came
from
mary
standish
for
he
was
facing
the
window
looking
steadily
away
from
her
yes
murdered
i
know
it
was
the
work
of
john
graham
he
did
do
it
personally
but
it
was
that
accomplished
the
end
of
course
nothing
ever
came
of
it
i
wo
tell
you
how
his
influence
and
power
have
dogged
me
how
they
destroyed
the
first
herd
of
reindeer
i
had
and
how
they
filled
the
newspapers
with
laughter
and
lies
about
me
when
i
was
down
in
the
states
last
winter
in
an
effort
to
make
people
see
a
little
something
of
the
truth
about
alaska
i
am
waiting
i
know
the
day
is
coming
when
i
shall
have
john
graham
as
my
father
had
him
under
our
mountain
twenty
years
ago
he
must
be
fifty
now
but
that
wo
save
him
when
the
time
comes
no
one
will
loosen
my
hands
as
i
loosened
my
father
and
all
alaska
will
rejoice
for
his
power
and
his
money
have
become
twin
monsters
that
are
destroying
alaska
just
as
he
destroyed
the
life
of
my
father
unless
he
dies
and
his
ends
he
will
make
of
this
great
land
nothing
more
than
a
shell
out
of
which
he
and
his
kind
have
taken
all
the
meat
and
the
hour
of
deadliest
danger
is
now
upon
us
he
looked
at
mary
standish
and
it
was
as
if
death
had
come
to
her
where
she
sat
she
seemed
not
to
breathe
and
her
face
was
so
white
it
frightened
him
and
then
slowly
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
and
never
had
he
seen
such
living
pools
of
torture
and
of
horror
he
was
amazed
at
the
quietness
of
her
voice
when
she
began
to
speak
and
startled
by
the
almost
deadly
coldness
of
it
i
think
you
can
understand
now
why
i
leaped
into
the
sea
why
i
wanted
the
world
to
think
i
was
dead
and
why
i
have
feared
to
tell
you
the
truth
she
said
am
john
graham
chapter
xix
alan
first
thought
was
of
the
monstrous
incongruity
of
the
thing
the
almost
physical
impossibility
of
a
mésalliance
of
the
sort
mary
standish
had
revealed
to
him
he
saw
her
young
and
beautiful
with
face
and
eyes
that
from
the
beginning
had
made
him
feel
all
that
was
good
and
sweet
in
life
and
behind
her
he
saw
the
of
john
graham
the
pitiless
without
conscience
and
without
soul
coarsened
by
power
fiendish
in
his
iniquities
and
old
enough
to
be
her
father
a
slow
smile
twisted
his
lips
but
he
did
not
know
he
smiled
he
pulled
himself
together
without
letting
her
see
the
physical
part
of
the
effort
it
was
taking
and
he
tried
to
find
something
to
say
that
would
help
clear
her
eyes
of
the
agony
that
was
in
them
that
is
a
most
unreasonable
thing
to
be
true
he
said
it
seemed
to
him
his
lips
were
making
words
out
of
wood
and
that
the
words
were
fatuously
inefficient
compared
with
what
he
should
have
said
or
acted
under
the
circumstances
she
nodded
it
is
but
the
world
does
look
at
it
in
that
way
such
things
just
happen
she
reached
for
a
book
which
lay
on
the
table
where
the
tundra
daisies
were
heaped
it
was
a
book
written
around
the
early
phases
of
pioneer
life
in
alaska
taken
from
his
own
library
a
volume
of
statistical
worth
dryly
but
carefully
written
and
she
had
been
reading
it
it
struck
him
as
a
symbol
of
the
fight
she
was
making
of
her
courage
and
of
her
desire
to
triumph
in
the
face
of
tremendous
odds
that
must
have
beset
her
he
still
could
not
associate
her
completely
with
john
graham
yet
his
face
was
cold
and
white
her
hand
trembled
a
little
as
she
opened
the
book
and
took
from
it
a
newspaper
clipping
she
did
not
speak
as
she
unfolded
it
and
gave
it
to
him
at
the
top
of
two
printed
columns
was
the
picture
of
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
in
an
oval
covering
a
small
space
over
the
girl
shoulder
was
a
picture
of
a
man
of
fifty
or
so
both
were
strangers
to
him
he
read
their
names
and
then
the
headlines
a
love
was
the
caption
and
after
the
word
love
was
a
dollar
sign
youth
and
age
beauty
and
the
other
thing
two
great
fortunes
united
he
caught
the
idea
and
looked
at
mary
standish
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
think
of
her
as
mary
graham
i
tore
that
from
a
paper
in
cordova
she
said
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
the
girl
lives
in
texas
but
do
you
see
something
in
her
eyes
ca
you
see
it
even
in
the
picture
she
has
on
her
wedding
things
but
it
seemed
to
me
when
i
saw
her
face
that
in
her
eyes
were
agony
and
despair
and
hopelessness
and
that
she
was
bravely
trying
to
hide
them
from
the
world
it
just
another
proof
one
of
thousands
that
such
unreasonable
things
do
happen
he
was
beginning
to
feel
a
dull
and
painless
sort
of
calm
the
stoicism
which
came
to
possess
him
whenever
he
was
confronted
by
the
inevitable
he
sat
down
and
with
his
head
bowed
over
it
took
one
of
the
limp
little
hands
that
lay
in
mary
standish
lap
the
warmth
had
gone
out
of
it
it
was
cold
and
lifeless
he
caressed
it
gently
and
held
it
between
his
brown
muscular
hands
staring
at
it
and
yet
seeing
nothing
in
particular
it
was
only
the
ticking
of
keok
clock
that
broke
the
silence
for
a
time
then
he
released
the
hand
and
it
dropped
in
the
girl
lap
again
she
had
been
looking
steadily
at
the
streak
of
gray
in
his
hair
and
a
light
came
into
her
eyes
a
light
which
he
did
not
see
and
a
little
tremble
of
her
lips
and
an
almost
imperceptible
inclination
of
her
head
toward
him
i
sorry
i
did
know
he
said
i
realize
now
how
you
must
have
felt
back
there
in
the
cottonwoods
no
you
do
realize
do
she
protested
in
an
instant
it
seemed
to
him
a
vibrant
flaming
life
swept
over
her
again
it
was
as
if
his
words
had
touched
fire
to
some
secret
thing
as
if
he
had
unlocked
a
door
which
grim
hopelessness
had
closed
he
was
amazed
at
the
swiftness
with
which
color
came
into
her
cheeks
you
do
understand
and
i
am
determined
that
you
she
went
on
i
would
die
before
i
let
you
go
away
thinking
what
is
now
in
your
mind
you
will
despise
me
but
i
would
rather
be
hated
for
the
truth
than
because
of
the
horrible
thing
which
you
must
believe
if
i
remain
silent
she
forced
a
wan
smile
to
her
lips
you
know
belinda
mulrooneys
were
very
well
in
their
day
but
they
do
fit
in
now
do
they
if
a
woman
makes
a
mistake
and
tries
to
remedy
it
in
a
fighting
sort
of
way
as
belinda
mulrooney
might
have
done
back
in
the
days
when
alaska
was
young
she
finished
with
a
little
gesture
of
despair
i
have
committed
a
great
folly
she
said
hesitating
an
instant
in
his
silence
i
see
very
clearly
now
the
course
i
should
have
taken
you
will
advise
me
that
it
is
still
not
too
late
when
you
have
heard
what
i
am
going
to
say
your
face
is
like
a
rock
it
is
because
your
tragedy
is
mine
he
said
she
turned
her
eyes
from
him
the
color
in
her
cheeks
deepened
it
was
a
vivid
feverish
glow
i
was
born
rich
enormously
hatefully
rich
she
said
in
the
low
unimpassioned
voice
of
a
confessional
i
remember
father
or
mother
i
lived
always
with
my
grandfather
standish
and
my
uncle
peter
standish
until
i
was
thirteen
i
had
my
uncle
peter
who
was
grandfather
brother
and
lived
with
us
i
worshiped
uncle
peter
he
was
a
cripple
from
young
manhood
he
had
lived
in
a
and
he
was
nearly
when
he
died
as
a
baby
that
and
my
rides
in
it
with
him
about
the
great
house
in
which
we
lived
were
my
delights
he
was
my
father
and
mother
everything
that
was
good
and
sweet
in
life
i
remember
thinking
as
a
child
that
if
god
was
as
good
as
uncle
peter
he
was
a
wonderful
god
it
was
uncle
peter
who
told
me
year
after
year
the
old
stories
and
legends
of
the
standishes
and
he
was
always
happy
always
happy
and
glad
and
seeing
nothing
but
sunshine
though
he
had
stood
on
his
feet
for
nearly
sixty
years
and
my
uncle
peter
died
when
i
was
thirteen
five
days
before
my
birthday
came
i
think
he
must
have
been
to
me
what
your
father
was
to
you
he
nodded
there
was
something
that
was
not
the
hardness
of
rock
in
his
face
now
and
john
graham
seemed
to
have
faded
away
i
was
left
then
alone
with
my
grandfather
standish
she
went
on
he
did
love
me
as
my
uncle
peter
loved
me
and
i
do
think
i
loved
him
but
i
was
proud
of
him
i
thought
the
whole
world
must
have
stood
in
awe
of
him
as
i
did
as
i
grew
older
i
learned
the
world
afraid
of
him
bankers
presidents
even
the
strongest
men
in
great
financial
interests
afraid
of
him
and
of
his
partners
the
grahams
and
of
sharpleigh
who
my
uncle
peter
had
told
me
was
the
cleverest
lawyer
in
the
nation
and
who
had
grown
up
in
the
business
of
the
two
families
my
grandfather
was
when
uncle
peter
died
so
it
was
john
graham
who
was
the
actual
working
force
behind
the
combined
fortunes
of
the
two
families
sometimes
as
i
now
recall
it
uncle
peter
was
like
a
little
child
i
remember
how
he
tried
to
make
me
understand
just
how
big
my
grandfather
interests
were
by
telling
me
that
if
two
dollars
were
taken
from
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
united
states
it
would
just
about
add
up
to
what
he
and
the
grahams
possessed
and
my
grandfather
standish
interests
were
of
the
whole
i
remember
how
a
hunted
look
would
come
into
my
uncle
face
at
times
when
i
asked
him
how
all
this
money
was
used
and
where
it
was
and
he
never
answered
me
as
i
wanted
to
be
answered
and
i
never
understood
i
did
know
people
feared
my
grandfather
and
john
graham
i
did
know
of
the
stupendous
power
my
grandfather
money
had
rolled
up
for
them
i
did
know
her
voice
sank
to
a
shuddering
whisper
i
did
know
how
they
were
using
it
in
alaska
for
instance
i
did
know
it
was
feeding
upon
starvation
and
ruin
and
death
i
think
even
uncle
peter
knew
she
looked
at
alan
steadily
and
her
gray
eyes
seemed
burning
up
with
a
slow
fire
why
even
then
before
uncle
peter
died
i
had
become
one
of
the
biggest
factors
in
all
their
schemes
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
suspect
that
john
graham
was
a
little
girl
of
thirteen
and
i
did
guess
that
my
grandfather
standish
so
straight
so
grandly
white
of
beard
and
hair
so
like
a
god
of
power
when
he
stood
among
men
was
even
then
planning
that
i
should
be
given
to
him
so
that
a
monumental
combination
of
wealth
might
increase
itself
still
more
in
that
juggernaut
of
financial
achievement
for
which
he
lived
and
to
bring
about
my
sacrifice
to
make
sure
it
would
not
fail
they
set
sharpleigh
to
the
task
because
sharpleigh
was
sweet
and
good
of
face
and
gentle
like
uncle
peter
so
that
i
loved
him
and
had
confidence
in
him
without
a
suspicion
that
under
his
white
hair
lay
a
brain
which
matched
in
cunning
and
mercilessness
that
of
john
graham
himself
and
he
did
his
work
well
alan
a
second
time
she
had
spoken
his
name
softly
and
without
embarrassment
with
her
nervous
fingers
tying
and
untying
the
two
corners
of
a
little
handkerchief
in
her
lap
she
went
on
after
a
moment
of
silence
in
which
the
ticking
of
keok
clock
seemed
tense
and
loud
when
i
was
seventeen
grandfather
standish
died
i
wish
you
could
understand
all
that
followed
without
my
telling
you
how
i
clung
to
sharpleigh
as
a
father
how
i
trusted
him
and
how
cleverly
and
gently
he
educated
me
to
the
thought
that
it
was
right
and
just
and
my
greatest
duty
in
life
to
carry
out
the
stipulation
of
my
will
and
marry
john
graham
otherwise
he
told
me
if
that
union
was
not
brought
about
before
i
was
not
a
dollar
of
the
great
fortune
would
go
to
the
house
of
standish
and
because
he
was
clever
enough
to
know
that
money
alone
would
not
urge
me
he
showed
me
a
letter
which
he
said
my
uncle
peter
had
written
and
which
i
was
to
read
on
my
seventeenth
birthday
and
in
that
letter
uncle
peter
urged
me
to
live
up
to
the
standish
name
and
join
in
that
union
of
the
two
great
fortunes
which
he
and
grandfather
standish
had
always
planned
i
did
dream
the
letter
was
a
forgery
and
in
the
end
they
won
and
i
promised
she
sat
with
bowed
head
crumpling
the
bit
of
cambric
between
her
fingers
do
you
despise
me
she
asked
no
he
replied
in
a
tense
unimpassioned
voice
i
love
you
she
tried
to
look
at
him
calmly
and
bravely
in
his
face
again
lay
the
immobility
of
rock
and
in
his
eyes
a
sullen
slumbering
fire
i
promised
she
repeated
quickly
as
if
regretting
the
impulse
that
had
made
her
ask
him
the
question
but
it
was
to
be
business
a
cold
unsentimental
business
i
disliked
john
graham
yet
i
would
marry
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
i
would
be
his
wife
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
i
would
remain
his
wife
but
never
more
than
that
they
agreed
and
i
in
my
ignorance
believed
i
did
see
the
trap
i
did
see
the
wicked
triumph
in
john
graham
heart
no
power
could
have
made
me
believe
then
that
he
wanted
to
possess
only
that
he
was
horrible
enough
to
want
me
even
without
love
that
he
was
a
great
monster
of
a
spider
and
i
the
fly
lured
into
his
web
and
the
agony
of
it
was
that
in
all
the
years
since
uncle
peter
died
i
had
dreamed
strange
and
beautiful
dreams
i
lived
in
a
world
of
my
own
and
i
read
read
read
and
the
thought
grew
stronger
and
stronger
in
me
that
i
had
lived
another
life
somewhere
and
that
i
belonged
back
in
the
years
when
the
world
was
clean
and
there
was
love
and
vast
reaches
of
land
wherein
money
and
power
were
little
guessed
of
and
where
romance
and
the
glory
of
manhood
and
womanhood
rose
above
all
other
things
oh
i
wanted
these
things
and
yet
because
others
had
molded
me
and
because
of
my
misguided
standish
sense
of
pride
and
honor
i
was
shackling
myself
to
john
graham
in
the
last
months
preceding
my
birthday
i
learned
more
of
the
man
than
i
had
ever
known
before
rumors
came
to
me
i
investigated
a
little
and
i
began
to
find
the
hatred
and
the
reason
for
it
which
has
come
to
me
so
conclusively
here
in
alaska
i
almost
knew
at
the
last
that
he
was
a
monster
but
the
world
had
been
told
i
was
to
marry
him
and
sharpleigh
with
his
fatherly
hypocrisy
was
behind
me
and
john
graham
treated
me
so
courteously
and
so
coolly
that
i
did
not
suspect
the
terrible
things
in
his
heart
and
mind
and
i
went
on
with
the
bargain
married
she
drew
a
sudden
deep
breath
as
if
she
had
passed
through
the
ordeal
of
what
she
had
most
dreaded
to
say
and
now
meeting
the
changeless
expression
of
alan
face
with
a
fierce
little
cry
that
leaped
from
her
like
a
flash
of
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
stood
with
her
back
crushed
against
the
tundra
flowers
her
voice
trembling
as
she
continued
while
he
stood
up
and
faced
her
you
need
go
on
he
interrupted
in
a
voice
so
low
and
terribly
hard
that
she
felt
the
menacing
thrill
of
it
you
need
i
will
settle
with
john
graham
if
god
gives
me
the
chance
you
would
have
me
stop
before
i
have
told
you
of
the
only
shred
of
triumph
to
which
i
may
lay
claim
she
protested
oh
you
may
be
sure
that
i
realize
the
sickening
folly
and
wickedness
of
it
all
but
i
swear
before
my
god
that
i
did
realize
it
then
until
it
was
too
late
to
you
alan
clean
as
the
great
mountains
and
plains
that
have
been
a
part
of
you
i
know
how
impossible
this
must
seem
that
i
should
marry
a
man
i
at
first
feared
then
loathed
then
came
to
hate
with
a
deadly
hatred
that
i
should
sacrifice
myself
because
i
thought
it
was
a
duty
that
i
should
be
so
weak
so
ignorant
so
like
soft
clay
in
the
hands
of
those
i
trusted
yet
i
tell
you
that
at
no
time
did
i
think
or
suspect
that
i
was
sacrificing
at
no
time
blind
though
you
may
call
me
did
i
see
a
hint
of
that
sickening
danger
into
which
i
was
voluntarily
going
no
not
even
an
hour
before
the
wedding
did
i
suspect
that
for
it
had
all
been
so
coldly
planned
like
a
great
deal
in
finance
so
carefully
adjudged
by
us
all
as
a
business
affair
that
i
felt
no
fear
except
that
sickness
of
soul
which
comes
of
giving
up
life
and
no
hint
of
it
came
until
the
last
of
the
few
words
were
spoken
which
made
us
man
and
wife
and
then
i
saw
in
john
graham
eyes
something
which
i
had
never
seen
there
before
and
sharpleigh
her
hands
caught
at
her
breast
her
gray
eyes
were
pools
of
flame
i
went
to
my
room
i
did
lock
my
door
because
never
had
it
been
necessary
to
do
that
i
did
cry
no
i
did
cry
but
something
strange
was
happening
to
me
which
tears
might
have
prevented
it
seemed
to
me
there
were
many
walls
to
my
room
i
was
faint
the
windows
seemed
to
appear
and
disappear
and
in
that
sickness
i
reached
my
bed
then
i
saw
the
door
open
and
john
graham
came
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
locked
it
my
room
he
had
come
into
room
the
unexpectedness
of
it
the
horror
the
insult
roused
me
from
my
stupor
i
sprang
up
to
face
him
and
there
he
stood
within
arm
reach
of
me
a
look
in
his
face
which
told
me
at
last
the
truth
which
i
had
failed
to
suspect
or
fear
his
arms
were
reaching
out
are
my
wife
he
said
oh
i
knew
then
are
my
he
repeated
i
wanted
to
scream
but
i
could
and
then
then
his
arms
reached
me
i
felt
them
crushing
around
me
like
the
coils
of
a
great
snake
the
poison
of
his
lips
was
at
my
face
and
i
believed
that
i
was
lost
and
that
no
power
could
save
me
in
this
hour
from
the
man
who
had
come
to
my
room
the
man
who
was
my
husband
i
think
it
was
uncle
peter
who
gave
me
voice
who
put
the
right
words
in
my
brain
who
made
me
laugh
yes
laugh
and
almost
caress
him
with
my
hands
the
change
in
me
amazed
him
stunned
him
and
he
freed
me
while
i
told
him
that
in
these
first
few
hours
of
wifehood
i
wanted
to
be
alone
and
that
he
should
come
to
me
that
evening
and
that
i
would
be
waiting
for
him
and
i
smiled
at
him
as
i
said
these
things
smiled
while
i
wanted
to
kill
him
and
he
went
a
great
gloating
triumphant
beast
believing
that
the
obedience
of
wifehood
was
about
to
give
him
what
he
had
expected
to
find
through
dishonor
and
i
was
left
alone
i
thought
of
only
one
thing
then
escape
i
saw
the
truth
it
swept
over
me
inundated
me
roared
in
my
ears
all
that
i
had
ever
lived
with
uncle
peter
came
back
to
me
this
was
not
his
world
it
had
never
been
and
it
was
not
mine
it
was
all
at
once
a
world
of
monsters
i
wanted
never
to
face
it
again
never
to
look
into
the
eyes
of
those
i
had
known
and
even
as
these
thoughts
and
desires
swept
upon
me
i
was
filling
a
traveling
bag
in
a
fever
of
madness
and
uncle
peter
was
at
my
side
urging
me
to
hurry
telling
me
i
had
no
minutes
to
lose
for
the
man
who
had
left
me
was
clever
and
might
guess
the
truth
that
lay
hid
behind
my
smiles
and
cajolery
i
stole
out
through
the
back
of
the
house
and
as
i
went
i
heard
sharpleigh
low
laughter
in
the
library
it
was
a
new
kind
of
laughter
and
with
it
i
heard
john
graham
voice
i
was
thinking
only
of
the
sea
to
get
away
on
the
sea
a
taxi
took
me
to
my
bank
and
i
drew
money
i
went
to
the
wharves
intent
only
on
boarding
a
ship
any
ship
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
uncle
peter
was
leading
me
and
we
came
to
a
great
ship
that
was
leaving
for
alaska
and
you
know
what
happened
then
alan
holt
with
a
sob
she
bowed
her
face
in
her
hands
but
only
an
instant
it
was
there
and
when
she
looked
at
alan
again
there
were
no
tears
in
her
eyes
but
a
soft
glory
of
pride
and
exultation
i
am
clean
of
john
graham
she
cried
he
stood
twisting
his
hands
twisting
them
in
a
helpless
futile
sort
of
way
and
it
was
he
and
not
the
girl
who
felt
like
bowing
his
head
that
the
tears
might
come
unseen
for
her
eyes
were
bright
and
shining
and
clear
as
stars
do
you
despise
me
now
i
love
you
he
said
again
and
made
no
movement
toward
her
i
am
glad
she
whispered
and
she
did
not
look
at
him
but
at
the
sunlit
plain
which
lay
beyond
the
window
and
rossland
was
on
the
and
saw
you
and
sent
word
back
to
graham
he
said
fighting
to
keep
himself
from
going
nearer
to
her
she
nodded
yes
and
so
i
came
to
you
and
failing
there
i
leaped
into
the
sea
for
i
wanted
them
to
think
i
was
dead
and
rossland
was
hurt
yes
strangely
i
heard
of
it
in
cordova
men
like
rossland
frequently
come
to
unexpected
ends
he
went
to
the
door
which
she
had
closed
and
opened
it
and
stood
looking
toward
the
blue
billows
of
the
foothills
with
the
white
crests
of
the
mountains
behind
them
she
came
after
a
moment
and
stood
beside
him
i
understand
she
said
softly
and
her
hand
lay
in
a
gentle
touch
upon
his
arm
you
are
trying
to
see
some
way
out
and
you
can
see
only
one
that
is
to
go
back
face
the
creatures
i
hate
regain
my
freedom
in
the
old
way
and
i
too
can
see
no
other
way
i
came
on
impulse
i
must
return
with
impulse
and
madness
burned
out
of
me
and
i
am
sorry
i
dread
it
i
would
rather
die
and
i
he
began
then
caught
himself
and
pointed
to
the
distant
hills
and
mountains
the
herds
are
there
he
said
i
am
going
to
them
i
may
be
gone
a
week
or
more
will
you
promise
me
to
be
here
when
i
return
yes
if
that
is
your
desire
it
is
she
was
so
near
that
his
lips
might
have
touched
her
shining
hair
and
when
you
return
i
must
go
that
will
be
the
only
way
i
think
so
it
will
be
hard
it
may
be
after
all
that
i
am
a
coward
but
to
face
all
that
alone
you
wo
be
alone
he
said
quietly
still
looking
at
the
hills
if
you
go
i
am
going
with
you
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
stopped
breathing
for
a
moment
at
his
side
and
then
with
a
little
sobbing
cry
she
drew
away
from
him
and
stood
at
the
door
of
nawadlook
room
and
the
glory
in
her
eyes
was
the
glory
of
his
dreams
as
he
had
wandered
with
her
hand
in
hand
over
the
tundras
in
those
days
of
grief
and
when
he
had
thought
she
was
dead
i
am
glad
i
was
in
ellen
mccormick
cabin
the
day
you
came
she
was
saying
and
i
thank
god
for
giving
me
the
madness
and
courage
to
come
to
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
in
the
world
now
because
love
you
and
as
nawadlook
door
closed
behind
her
alan
stumbled
out
into
the
sunlight
a
great
drumming
in
his
heart
and
a
tumult
in
his
brain
that
twisted
the
world
about
him
until
for
a
little
it
held
neither
vision
nor
space
nor
sound
chapter
xx
in
that
way
with
the
beautiful
world
swimming
in
sunshine
and
golden
tundra
haze
until
foothills
and
mountains
were
like
castles
in
a
dream
alan
holt
set
off
with
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
leaving
stampede
and
keok
and
nawadlook
at
the
corral
bars
with
stampede
little
regretting
that
he
was
left
behind
to
guard
the
range
for
a
mighty
resolution
had
taken
root
in
the
prospector
heart
and
he
felt
himself
thrilled
and
a
bit
trembling
at
the
nearness
of
the
greatest
drama
that
had
ever
entered
his
life
alan
looking
back
after
the
first
few
minutes
saw
that
keok
and
nawadlook
stood
alone
stampede
was
gone
the
ridge
beyond
the
coulée
out
of
which
mary
standish
had
come
with
wild
flowers
soon
closed
like
a
door
between
him
and
sokwenna
cabin
and
the
straight
trail
to
the
mountains
lay
ahead
and
over
this
alan
set
the
pace
with
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
and
a
caravan
of
seven
behind
him
bearing
supplies
for
the
herdsmen
alan
had
scarcely
spoken
to
the
two
men
he
knew
the
driving
force
which
was
sending
him
to
the
mountains
was
not
only
an
impulse
but
almost
an
inspirational
thing
born
of
necessity
each
step
that
he
took
with
his
head
and
heart
in
a
swirl
of
intoxicating
madness
was
an
effort
behind
which
he
was
putting
a
sheer
weight
of
physical
will
he
wanted
to
go
back
the
urge
was
upon
him
to
surrender
utterly
to
the
weakness
of
forgetting
that
mary
standish
was
a
wife
he
had
almost
fallen
a
victim
to
his
selfishness
and
passion
in
the
moment
when
she
stood
at
nawadlook
door
telling
him
that
she
loved
him
an
iron
hand
had
drawn
him
out
into
the
day
and
it
was
the
same
iron
hand
that
kept
his
face
to
the
mountains
now
while
in
his
brain
her
voice
repeated
the
words
that
had
set
his
world
on
fire
he
knew
what
had
happened
this
morning
was
not
the
merely
important
and
essential
incident
of
most
human
lives
it
had
been
a
cataclysmic
thing
with
him
probably
it
would
be
impossible
for
even
the
girl
ever
fully
to
understand
and
he
needed
to
be
alone
to
gather
strength
and
mental
calmness
for
the
meeting
of
the
problem
ahead
of
him
a
complication
so
unexpected
that
the
very
foundation
of
that
stoic
equanimity
which
the
mountains
had
bred
in
him
had
suffered
a
temporary
upsetting
his
happiness
was
almost
an
insanity
the
dream
wherein
he
had
wandered
with
a
spirit
of
the
dead
had
come
true
it
was
the
old
idyl
in
the
flesh
again
his
father
his
mother
and
back
in
the
cabin
beyond
the
ridge
such
a
love
had
cried
out
to
him
and
he
was
afraid
to
return
he
laughed
the
fact
aloud
happily
and
with
an
unrepressed
exultation
as
he
strode
ahead
of
the
and
with
that
exultation
words
came
to
his
lips
words
intended
for
himself
alone
telling
him
that
mary
standish
belonged
to
him
and
that
until
the
end
of
eternity
he
would
fight
for
her
and
keep
her
yet
he
kept
on
facing
the
mountains
and
he
walked
so
swiftly
that
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
fell
steadily
behind
with
the
deer
so
that
in
time
long
dips
and
swells
of
the
tundra
lay
between
them
with
grim
persistence
he
kept
at
himself
and
at
last
there
swept
over
him
in
its
ultimate
triumph
a
compelling
sense
of
the
justice
of
what
he
had
done
justice
to
mary
standish
even
now
he
did
not
think
of
her
as
mary
graham
but
she
was
graham
wife
and
if
he
had
gone
to
her
in
that
moment
of
glorious
confession
when
she
had
stood
at
door
if
he
had
violated
her
faith
when
because
of
faith
she
had
laid
the
world
at
his
feet
he
would
have
fallen
to
the
level
of
john
graham
himself
thought
of
the
narrowness
of
his
escape
and
of
the
first
mad
desire
to
call
her
back
from
nawadlook
room
to
hold
her
in
his
arms
again
as
he
had
held
her
in
the
cottonwoods
brought
a
hot
fire
into
his
face
something
greater
than
his
own
fighting
instinct
had
turned
him
to
the
open
door
of
the
cabin
it
was
mary
standish
her
courage
of
faith
and
love
shining
in
her
eyes
her
measurement
of
him
as
a
man
she
had
not
been
afraid
to
say
what
was
in
her
heart
because
she
knew
what
he
would
do
found
him
waiting
for
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
at
the
edge
of
a
slough
where
willows
grew
deep
and
green
and
the
crested
billows
of
stood
the
faces
of
the
herdsmen
were
sweating
thereafter
alan
walked
with
them
until
in
that
hour
when
the
sun
had
sunk
to
its
lowest
plane
they
came
to
the
first
of
the
endicott
foothills
here
they
rested
until
the
coolness
of
deeper
evening
when
a
golden
twilight
filled
the
land
and
then
resumed
the
journey
toward
the
mountains
midsummer
heat
and
the
winged
pests
of
the
lower
lands
had
driven
the
herds
steadily
into
the
cooler
altitudes
of
the
higher
plateaux
and
valleys
here
they
had
split
into
telescoping
columns
which
drifted
in
slowly
moving
streams
wherever
the
doors
of
the
hills
and
mountains
opened
into
new
grazing
fields
until
alan
ten
thousand
reindeer
were
in
three
divisions
two
of
the
greatest
traveling
westward
and
one
of
a
thousand
head
working
north
and
east
the
first
and
second
days
alan
remained
with
the
nearest
and
southward
herd
the
third
day
he
went
on
with
tautuk
and
two
through
a
break
in
the
mountains
and
joined
the
herdsmen
of
the
second
and
higher
multitude
of
feeding
animals
there
began
to
possess
him
a
curious
disinclination
to
hurry
and
this
aversion
grew
in
a
direct
ratio
with
the
thought
which
was
becoming
stronger
in
him
with
each
mile
and
hour
of
his
progress
a
multitude
of
emotions
were
buried
under
the
conviction
that
mary
standish
must
leave
the
range
when
he
returned
he
had
a
grim
sense
of
honor
and
a
particularly
devout
one
when
it
had
to
do
with
women
and
though
he
conceded
nothing
of
right
and
justice
in
the
relationship
which
existed
between
the
woman
he
loved
and
john
graham
he
knew
that
she
must
go
to
remain
at
the
range
was
the
one
impossible
thing
for
her
to
do
he
would
take
her
to
tanana
he
would
go
with
her
to
the
states
the
matter
would
be
settled
in
a
reasonable
and
intelligent
way
and
when
he
came
back
he
would
bring
her
with
him
but
beneath
this
undercurrent
of
decision
fought
the
thing
which
his
will
held
down
and
yet
never
quite
throttled
completely
that
something
which
urged
him
with
an
unconquerable
persistence
to
hold
with
his
own
hands
what
a
glorious
fate
had
given
him
and
to
finish
with
john
graham
if
it
ever
came
to
that
in
the
madly
desirable
way
he
visioned
for
himself
in
those
occasional
moments
when
the
fires
of
temptation
blazed
hottest
the
fourth
night
he
said
to
tautuk
if
keok
should
marry
another
man
what
would
you
do
it
was
a
moment
before
tautuk
looked
at
him
and
in
the
herdsman
eyes
was
a
wild
mute
question
as
if
suddenly
there
had
leaped
into
his
stolid
mind
a
suspicion
which
had
never
come
to
him
before
alan
laid
a
reassuring
hand
upon
his
arm
i
do
mean
she
going
to
tautuk
he
laughed
she
loves
you
i
know
it
only
you
are
so
stupid
and
so
slow
and
so
hopeless
as
a
lover
that
she
is
punishing
you
while
she
has
the
right
before
she
marries
you
but
if
she
marry
someone
else
what
would
you
do
my
brother
asked
tautuk
no
a
relative
no
a
friend
no
a
stranger
someone
who
had
injured
you
for
instance
someone
keok
hated
and
who
had
cheated
her
into
marrying
him
i
would
kill
him
said
tautuk
quietly
it
was
this
night
the
temptation
was
strongest
upon
alan
why
should
mary
standish
go
back
he
asked
himself
she
had
surrendered
everything
to
escape
from
the
horror
down
there
she
had
given
up
fortune
and
friends
she
had
scattered
convention
to
the
four
winds
had
gambled
her
life
in
the
hazard
and
in
the
end
had
come
to
him
why
should
he
not
keep
her
john
graham
and
the
world
believed
she
was
dead
and
he
was
master
here
if
some
day
graham
should
happen
to
cross
his
path
he
would
settle
the
matter
in
tautuk
way
later
while
tautuk
slept
and
the
world
lay
about
him
in
a
soft
glow
and
the
valley
below
was
filled
with
misty
billows
of
twilight
out
of
which
came
to
him
faintly
the
curious
crackling
sound
of
reindeer
hoofs
and
the
grunting
contentment
of
the
feeding
herd
the
reaction
came
as
he
had
known
it
would
come
in
the
end
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
he
set
out
alone
for
the
eastward
herd
and
on
the
sixth
overtook
tatpan
and
his
herdsmen
tatpan
like
keok
and
nawadlook
had
a
of
white
in
him
and
when
alan
came
up
to
him
in
the
edge
of
the
valley
where
the
deer
were
grazing
he
was
lying
on
a
rock
playing
yankee
doodle
on
a
it
was
tatpan
who
told
him
that
an
hour
or
two
before
an
exhausted
stranger
had
come
into
camp
looking
for
him
and
that
the
man
was
asleep
now
apparently
more
dead
than
alive
but
had
given
instructions
to
be
awakened
at
the
end
of
two
hours
and
not
a
minute
later
together
they
had
a
look
at
him
he
was
a
small
man
with
carroty
blond
hair
and
a
peculiarly
boyish
appearance
as
he
lay
doubled
up
like
a
profoundly
asleep
tatpan
looked
at
his
big
silver
watch
and
in
a
low
voice
described
how
the
stranger
had
stumbled
into
camp
so
tired
he
could
scarcely
put
one
foot
ahead
of
the
other
and
that
he
had
dropped
down
where
he
now
lay
when
he
learned
alan
was
with
one
of
the
other
herds
he
must
have
come
a
long
distance
said
tatpan
and
he
has
traveled
fast
something
familiar
about
the
man
grew
upon
alan
yet
he
could
not
place
him
he
wore
a
gun
which
he
had
unbelted
and
placed
within
reach
of
his
hand
on
the
grass
his
chin
was
pugnaciously
prominent
and
in
sleep
the
mysterious
stranger
had
crooked
a
forefinger
and
thumb
about
his
revolver
in
a
way
that
spoke
of
caution
and
experience
if
he
is
in
such
a
hurry
to
see
me
you
might
awaken
him
said
alan
he
turned
a
little
aside
and
knelt
to
drink
at
a
tiny
stream
of
water
that
ran
down
from
the
snowy
summits
and
he
could
hear
tatpan
rousing
the
stranger
by
the
time
he
had
finished
drinking
and
faced
about
the
little
man
with
the
hair
was
on
his
feet
alan
stared
and
the
little
man
grinned
his
ruddy
cheeks
grew
pinker
his
blue
eyes
twinkled
and
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
moment
of
embarrassment
he
gave
his
gun
a
sudden
snap
that
drew
an
exclamation
of
amazement
from
alan
only
one
man
in
the
world
had
he
ever
seen
throw
a
gun
into
its
holster
like
that
a
sickly
grin
began
to
spread
over
his
own
countenance
and
all
at
once
tatpan
eyes
began
to
bulge
stampede
he
cried
stampede
rubbed
a
hand
over
his
smooth
prominent
chin
and
nodded
apologetically
it
me
he
conceded
i
had
to
do
it
it
was
give
one
or
up
my
whiskers
they
went
hard
too
i
flipped
dice
an
the
whiskers
won
i
cut
cards
an
the
whiskers
won
i
played
klondike
an
the
whiskers
busted
the
bank
then
i
got
mad
an
shaved
do
i
look
so
bad
alan
you
look
twenty
years
younger
declared
alan
stifling
his
desire
to
laugh
when
he
saw
the
other
seriousness
stampede
was
thoughtfully
stroking
his
chin
then
why
the
devil
did
they
laugh
he
demanded
mary
standish
did
laugh
she
cried
just
stood
an
cried
an
then
sat
down
an
cried
she
thought
i
was
that
blamed
funny
and
keok
laughed
until
she
was
sick
an
had
to
go
to
bed
that
little
devil
of
a
keok
calls
me
pinkey
now
and
miss
standish
says
it
was
because
i
was
funny
that
she
laughed
but
that
the
change
in
me
was
so
sudden
she
could
help
it
nawadlook
says
i
got
a
chin
alan
gripped
his
hand
and
a
swift
change
came
over
stampede
face
a
steely
glitter
shot
into
the
blue
of
his
eyes
and
his
chin
hardened
nature
no
longer
disguised
the
stampede
smith
of
other
days
and
alan
felt
a
new
thrill
and
a
new
regard
for
the
man
whose
hand
he
held
this
at
last
was
the
man
whose
name
had
gone
before
him
up
and
down
the
old
trails
the
man
whose
cool
and
calculating
courage
whose
fearlessness
of
death
and
quickness
with
the
gun
had
written
pages
in
alaskan
history
which
would
never
be
forgotten
where
his
first
impulse
had
been
to
laugh
he
now
felt
the
grim
thrill
and
admiration
of
men
of
other
days
who
when
in
stampede
presence
knew
they
were
in
the
presence
of
a
master
the
old
stampede
had
come
to
life
again
and
alan
knew
why
the
grip
of
his
hand
tightened
and
stampede
returned
it
some
day
if
we
lucky
there
always
comes
a
woman
to
make
the
world
worth
living
in
stampede
he
said
there
does
replied
stampede
he
looked
steadily
at
alan
and
i
take
it
you
love
mary
standish
he
added
and
that
you
fight
for
her
if
you
had
to
i
would
said
alan
then
it
time
you
were
traveling
advised
stampede
significantly
i
been
twelve
hours
on
the
trail
without
a
rest
she
told
me
to
move
fast
and
i
moved
i
mean
mary
standish
she
said
it
was
almost
a
matter
of
life
and
death
that
i
find
you
in
a
hurry
i
wanted
to
stay
but
she
would
let
me
it
she
wants
rossland
is
at
the
range
yes
rossland
and
it
my
guess
john
graham
is
far
away
i
smell
happenings
alan
we
better
hurry
chapter
xxi
stampede
had
started
with
one
of
the
two
left
at
the
range
but
to
ride
successfully
and
with
any
degree
of
speed
and
specific
direction
was
an
accomplishment
which
he
had
neglected
and
within
the
first
miles
he
had
abandoned
the
adventure
to
continue
his
journey
on
foot
as
tatpan
had
no
in
his
herd
and
the
swiftest
messenger
would
require
many
hours
in
which
to
reach
amuk
toolik
alan
set
out
for
his
range
within
half
an
hour
after
his
arrival
at
tatpan
camp
stampede
declaring
himself
a
new
man
after
his
brief
rest
and
the
meal
which
followed
it
would
not
listen
to
alan
advice
that
he
follow
later
when
he
was
more
refreshed
a
fierce
and
reminiscent
gleam
smoldered
in
the
little
eyes
as
he
watched
alan
during
the
first
leg
of
their
race
through
the
foothills
to
the
tundras
alan
did
not
observe
it
or
the
grimness
that
had
settled
in
the
face
behind
him
his
own
mind
was
undergoing
an
upheaval
of
conjecture
and
wild
questioning
that
rossland
had
discovered
mary
standish
was
not
dead
was
the
least
astonishing
factor
in
the
new
development
the
information
might
easily
have
reached
him
through
sandy
mccormick
or
his
wife
ellen
the
astonishing
thing
was
that
he
had
in
some
mysterious
way
picked
up
the
trail
of
her
flight
a
thousand
miles
northward
and
the
still
more
amazing
fact
that
he
had
dared
to
follow
her
and
reveal
himself
openly
at
his
range
his
heart
pumped
hard
for
he
knew
rossland
must
be
directly
under
graham
orders
then
came
the
resolution
to
take
stampede
into
his
confidence
and
to
reveal
all
that
had
happened
on
the
day
of
his
departure
for
the
mountains
he
proceeded
to
do
this
without
equivocation
or
hesitancy
for
there
now
pressed
upon
him
a
grim
anticipation
of
impending
events
ahead
of
them
stampede
betrayed
no
astonishment
at
the
other
disclosures
the
smoldering
fire
remained
in
his
eyes
the
immobility
of
his
face
unchanged
only
when
alan
repeated
in
his
own
words
mary
confession
of
love
at
nawadlook
door
did
the
fighting
lines
soften
about
his
comrade
eyes
and
mouth
stampede
lips
responded
with
an
oddly
quizzical
smile
i
knew
that
a
long
time
ago
he
said
i
guessed
it
that
first
night
of
storm
in
the
coach
up
to
chitina
i
knew
it
for
certain
before
we
left
tanana
she
did
tell
me
but
i
was
blind
it
was
the
note
that
puzzled
and
frightened
me
the
note
she
stuffed
in
her
slipper
and
rossland
told
me
before
i
left
that
going
for
you
was
a
chase
as
he
intended
to
take
john
graham
back
with
him
immediately
and
you
left
her
alone
after
stampede
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
valiantly
kept
up
with
suddenly
quickened
pace
she
insisted
said
it
meant
life
and
death
for
her
and
she
looked
it
white
as
paper
after
her
talk
with
rossland
besides
what
sokwenna
wo
sleep
until
we
get
back
he
knows
i
told
him
and
watching
from
the
garret
window
with
savage
i
saw
him
pick
off
a
duck
the
other
day
at
two
hundred
yards
they
hurried
on
after
a
little
alan
said
with
the
fear
which
he
could
not
name
clutching
at
his
heart
why
did
you
say
graham
might
not
be
far
away
in
my
bones
replied
stampede
his
face
hard
as
rock
again
in
my
bones
is
that
all
not
quite
i
think
rossland
told
her
she
was
so
white
and
her
hand
cold
as
a
lump
of
clay
when
she
put
it
on
mine
it
was
in
her
eyes
too
besides
rossland
has
taken
possession
of
your
cabin
as
though
he
owns
it
i
take
it
that
means
somebody
behind
him
a
force
something
big
to
reckon
with
he
asked
me
how
many
men
we
had
i
told
him
stretching
it
a
little
he
grinned
he
could
keep
back
that
grin
it
was
as
if
a
devil
in
him
slipped
out
from
hiding
for
an
instant
suddenly
he
caught
alan
arm
and
stopped
him
his
chin
shot
out
the
sweat
ran
from
his
face
for
a
full
quarter
of
a
minute
the
two
men
stared
at
each
other
alan
we
i
damned
if
i
do
think
we
ought
to
call
the
herdsmen
in
and
every
man
with
a
loaded
gun
you
think
it
that
bad
might
be
if
graham
behind
rossland
and
has
men
with
him
we
two
and
a
half
hours
from
tatpan
said
alan
in
a
cold
unemotional
voice
he
has
only
half
a
dozen
men
with
him
and
it
will
take
at
least
four
to
make
quick
work
in
finding
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
there
are
eighteen
men
with
the
southward
herd
and
with
the
upper
i
mean
counting
the
boys
use
your
own
judgment
all
are
armed
it
may
be
foolish
but
i
following
your
hunch
they
gripped
hands
it
more
than
a
hunch
alan
breathed
stampede
softly
and
for
sake
keep
off
the
music
as
long
as
you
can
he
was
gone
and
as
his
agile
boyish
figure
started
in
a
toward
the
foothills
alan
set
his
face
southward
so
that
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
were
lost
to
each
other
in
the
undulating
distances
of
the
tundra
never
had
alan
traveled
as
on
the
last
of
this
sixth
day
of
his
absence
from
the
range
he
was
comparatively
fresh
as
his
trail
to
camp
had
not
been
an
exhausting
one
and
his
more
intimate
knowledge
of
the
country
gave
him
a
decided
advantage
over
stampede
he
believed
he
could
make
the
distance
in
ten
hours
but
to
this
he
would
be
compelled
to
add
a
rest
of
at
least
three
or
four
hours
during
the
night
it
was
now
eight
by
nine
or
ten
the
next
morning
he
would
be
facing
rossland
and
at
about
that
same
hour
tatpan
swift
messengers
would
be
closing
in
about
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
he
knew
the
speed
with
which
his
herdsmen
would
sweep
out
of
the
mountains
and
over
the
tundras
two
years
ago
amuk
toolik
and
a
dozen
of
his
eskimo
people
had
traveled
hours
without
rest
or
food
covering
a
hundred
and
nineteen
miles
in
that
time
his
blood
flushed
hot
with
pride
he
could
do
that
but
his
people
could
and
he
could
see
them
sweeping
in
from
the
telescoping
segments
of
the
herds
as
the
word
went
among
them
he
could
see
them
streaking
out
of
the
foothills
and
then
like
wolves
scattering
for
freer
air
and
he
saw
them
dotting
the
tundra
in
their
race
for
home
and
war
if
it
was
war
that
lay
ahead
of
them
twilight
began
to
creep
in
upon
him
like
veils
of
cool
dry
mist
out
of
the
horizons
and
hour
after
hour
he
went
on
eating
a
strip
of
pemmican
when
he
grew
hungry
and
drinking
in
the
spring
coulées
when
he
came
to
them
where
the
water
was
cold
and
clear
not
until
a
telltale
cramp
began
to
bite
warningly
in
his
leg
did
he
stop
for
the
rest
which
he
knew
he
must
take
it
was
one
counting
his
journey
to
camp
he
had
been
traveling
almost
steadily
for
seventeen
hours
not
until
he
stretched
himself
out
on
his
back
in
a
grassy
hollow
where
a
little
stream
a
foot
wide
rippled
close
to
his
ears
did
he
realize
how
tired
he
had
become
at
first
he
tried
not
to
sleep
rest
was
all
he
wanted
he
dared
not
close
his
eyes
but
exhaustion
overcame
him
at
last
and
he
slept
when
he
awoke
and
the
sun
were
taunting
him
he
sat
up
with
a
jerk
then
leaped
to
his
feet
in
alarm
his
watch
told
the
story
he
had
slept
soundly
for
six
hours
instead
of
resting
three
or
four
with
his
eyes
open
after
a
little
as
he
hurried
on
his
way
he
did
not
altogether
regret
what
had
happened
he
felt
like
a
fighting
man
he
breathed
deeply
ate
a
breakfast
of
pemmican
as
he
walked
and
proceeded
to
make
up
lost
time
the
interval
between
fifteen
minutes
of
twelve
and
twelve
he
almost
ran
that
quarter
of
an
hour
brought
him
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
from
which
he
could
look
upon
the
buildings
of
the
range
nothing
had
happened
that
he
could
see
he
gave
a
great
gasp
of
relief
and
in
his
joy
he
laughed
the
strangeness
of
the
laugh
told
him
more
than
anything
else
the
tension
he
had
been
under
another
and
he
came
up
out
of
the
dip
behind
cabin
and
tried
the
door
it
was
locked
a
voice
answered
his
knock
and
he
called
out
his
name
the
bolt
shot
back
the
door
opened
and
he
stepped
in
nawadlook
stood
at
her
bedroom
door
a
gun
in
her
hands
keok
faced
him
holding
grimly
to
a
long
knife
and
between
them
staring
at
him
as
he
entered
was
mary
standish
she
came
forward
to
meet
him
and
he
heard
a
whisper
from
nawadlook
and
saw
keok
follow
her
swiftly
through
the
door
into
the
other
room
mary
standish
held
out
her
hands
to
him
a
little
blindly
and
the
tremble
in
her
throat
and
the
look
in
her
eyes
betrayed
the
struggle
she
was
making
to
keep
from
breaking
down
and
crying
out
in
gladness
at
his
coming
it
was
that
look
that
sent
a
flood
of
joy
into
his
heart
even
when
he
saw
the
torture
and
hopelessness
behind
it
he
held
her
hands
close
and
into
her
eyes
he
smiled
in
such
a
way
that
he
saw
them
widen
as
if
she
almost
disbelieved
and
then
she
drew
in
a
sudden
quick
breath
and
her
fingers
clung
to
him
it
was
as
if
the
hope
that
had
deserted
her
came
in
an
instant
into
her
face
again
he
was
not
excited
he
was
not
even
perturbed
now
that
he
saw
that
light
in
her
eyes
and
knew
she
was
safe
but
his
love
was
there
she
saw
it
and
felt
the
force
of
it
behind
the
deadly
calmness
with
which
he
was
smiling
at
her
she
gave
a
little
sob
so
low
it
was
scarcely
more
than
a
broken
breath
a
little
cry
that
came
of
wonder
understanding
and
unspeakable
faith
in
this
man
who
was
smiling
at
her
so
confidently
in
the
face
of
the
tragedy
that
had
come
to
destroy
her
rossland
is
in
your
cabin
she
whispered
and
john
graham
is
back
there
somewhere
coming
this
way
rossland
says
that
if
i
do
go
to
him
of
my
own
free
will
he
felt
the
shudder
that
ran
through
her
i
understand
the
rest
he
said
they
stood
silent
for
a
moment
the
thrush
was
singing
on
the
roof
then
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
he
took
her
face
between
his
hands
and
bent
her
head
back
a
little
so
that
he
was
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
and
so
near
that
he
could
feel
the
sweet
warmth
of
her
breath
you
did
make
a
mistake
the
day
i
went
away
he
asked
you
love
me
yes
for
a
moment
longer
he
looked
into
her
eyes
then
he
stood
back
from
her
even
keok
and
nawadlook
heard
his
laugh
it
was
strange
they
thought
keok
with
her
knife
and
nawadlook
with
her
gun
for
the
bird
was
singing
and
alan
holt
was
laughing
and
mary
standish
was
very
still
another
moment
later
from
where
he
sat
at
the
little
window
in
the
attic
keeping
his
unsleeping
vigil
with
a
rifle
across
his
knees
old
sokwenna
saw
his
master
walk
across
the
open
and
something
in
the
manner
of
his
going
brought
back
a
vision
of
another
day
long
ago
when
ghost
kloof
had
rung
with
the
cries
of
battle
and
the
hands
now
gnarled
and
twisted
with
age
had
played
their
part
in
the
heroic
stand
of
his
people
against
the
oppressors
from
the
farther
north
then
he
saw
alan
go
into
the
cabin
where
rossland
was
and
softly
his
fingers
drummed
upon
the
ancient
which
lay
at
his
side
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
the
distant
mountains
and
under
his
breath
he
mumbled
the
old
chant
of
battle
dead
and
forgotten
except
in
brain
and
after
that
his
eyes
closed
and
again
the
vision
grew
out
of
darkness
like
a
picture
for
him
a
vision
of
twisting
trails
and
of
fighting
men
gathering
with
their
faces
set
for
war
chapter
xxii
at
the
desk
in
alan
sat
rossland
when
the
door
opened
behind
him
and
the
master
of
the
range
came
in
he
was
not
disturbed
when
he
saw
who
it
was
and
rose
to
meet
him
his
coat
was
off
his
sleeves
rolled
up
and
it
was
evident
he
was
making
no
effort
to
conceal
his
freedom
with
alan
books
and
papers
he
advanced
holding
out
a
hand
this
was
not
the
same
rossland
who
had
told
alan
to
attend
to
his
own
business
on
board
the
his
attitude
was
that
of
one
greeting
a
friend
smiling
and
affable
even
before
he
spoke
something
inspired
alan
to
return
the
smile
behind
that
smile
he
was
admiring
the
man
nerve
his
hand
met
casually
but
there
was
no
uncertainty
in
the
warmth
of
the
other
grip

i

turned

myself
aboard
the
if
she
had
shown
an
inclination
he
proffered
a
cigar
a
big
fat
cigar
with
a
gold
band
it
was
inspiration
again
that
made
alan
accept
it
and
light
it
his
blood
was
racing
but
rossland
saw
nothing
of
that
he
observed
only
the
nod
the
cool
smile
on
alan
lips
the
apparent
nonchalance
with
which
he
was
meeting
the
situation
it
pleased
graham
agent
he
reseated
himself
in
the
and
motioned
alan
to
another
chair
near
him
i
thought
you
were
badly
hurt

alan
nasty
knife
wound

shrugged
his
shoulders
there
you

hell
of
letting

pretty
face
run
away
with
you

of
the
thlinkit
girls
down
in
the
steerage
you
know
lovely
little
thing
was
she
tricked
her
into
my
cabin
all
right
but
she
was
like
some
other
indian
girls

known
the
next
night
a
brother
or
sweetheart
or
whoever
it
was
got
me
through
the
open
port
it
was
bad
i
was
out
of
the
hospital
within
a
week
lucky
i
was
put
there
too
otherwise
i
would
have
seen
graham
one
morning
through
the
window
what
a
little
our
fortunes
hang
to
at
times
eh
if
it
had
been
for
the
girl
and
the
knife
and
the
hospital
i
would
be
here
now
and
graham
would
be
bleeding
his
heart
out
with
impatience
and
you
holt
would
be
facing
the
biggest
opportunity
that
will
ever
come
into
your
life
i
afraid
i
do
understand
said
alan
hiding
his
face
in
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
and
speaking
with
an
apparent
indifference
which
had
its
effect
upon
rossland
your
presence
inclines
me
to
believe
that
luck
has
rather
turned
against
me
where
can
my
advantage
be
a
grim
seriousness
settled
in
rossland
eyes
and
his
voice
became
cool
and
hard
holt
as
two
men
who
are
not
afraid
to
meet
unusual
situations
we
may
as
well
call
a
spade
a
spade
in
this
matter
you
think
so
decidedly
said
alan
you
know
that
mary
standish
is
really
mary
standish
graham
john
graham
wife
yes
and
you
probably
know
now
why
she
jumped
into
the
sea
and
why
she
ran
away
from
graham
i
do
that
saves
a
lot
of
talk
but
there
is
another
side
to
the
story
which
you
probably
do
know
and
i
am
here
to
tell
it
to
you
john
graham
does
care
for
a
dollar
of
the
standish
fortune
it
the
girl
he
wants
and
has
always
wanted
she
has
grown
up
under
his
eyes
from
the
day
she
was
fourteen
years
old
he
has
lived
and
planned
with
the
thought
of
possessing
her
you
know
how
he
got
her
to
marry
him
and
you
know
what
happened
afterward
but
it
makes
no
difference
to
him
whether
she
hates
him
or
not
he
her
and
this
he
swept
his
arms
out
is
the
most
beautiful
place
in
the
world
in
which
to
have
her
returned
to
him
i
been
figuring
from
your
books
your
property
is
worth
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
as
it
stands
on
hoof
today
i
here
to
offer
you
five
times
that
for
it
in
other
words
graham
is
willing
to
forfeit
all
action
he
might
have
personally
against
you
for
stealing
his
wife
and
in
place
of
that
will
pay
you
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
the
privilege
of
having
his
honeymoon
here
and
making
of
this
place
a
country
estate
where
his
wife
may
reside
indefinitely
subject
to
her
husband
visits
when
he
is
so
inclined
there
will
be
a
stipulation
of
course
requiring
that
the
personal
details
of
the
deal
be
kept
strictly
confidential
and
that
you
leave
the
country
do
i
make
myself
clear
alan
rose
to
his
feet
and
paced
thoughtfully
across
the
room
at
least
rossland
measured
his
action
as
one
of
sudden
intensive
reflection
as
he
watched
him
smiling
complacently
at
the
effect
of
his
proposition
upon
the
other
he
had
not
minced
matters
he
had
come
to
the
point
without
an
effort
at
bargaining
and
he
possessed
sufficient
dramatic
sense
to
appreciate
what
the
offer
of
half
a
million
dollars
meant
to
an
individual
who
was
struggling
for
existence
at
the
edge
of
a
raw
frontier
alan
stood
with
his
back
toward
him
facing
a
window
his
voice
was
oddly
strained
when
he
answered
but
that
was
quite
natural
too
rossland
thought
i
am
wondering
if
i
understand
you
he
said
do
you
mean
that
if
i
sell
graham
the
range
leave
it
bag
and
baggage
and
agree
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
thereafter
he
will
give
me
half
a
million
dollars
that
is
the
price
you
are
to
take
your
people
with
you
graham
has
his
own
alan
tried
to
laugh
i
think
i
see
the
point
now
he
is
paying
five
hundred
thousand
for
miss
standish
i
mean
graham
he
paying
it
for
the
exactly
it
was
a
hunch
with
him
to
settle
the
matter
peaceably
we
started
up
here
to
get
his
wife
you
understand
to
her
and
settle
the
matter
with
you
in
a
different
way
from
the
one
we
using
now
you
hit
the
word
when
you
said
what
a
damn
fool
a
man
can
make
of
himself
over
a
pretty
face
think
of
it
half
a
million
dollars
it
sounds
unreal
mused
alan
keeping
his
face
to
the
window
why
should
he
offer
so
much
you
must
keep
the
stipulation
in
mind
holt
that
is
an
important
part
of
the
deal
you
are
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
buying
the
range
at
a
normal
price
would
guarantee
it
but
when
you
accept
a
sum
like
that
you
a
partner
in
the
other
end
of
the
transaction
and
your
health
depends
upon
keeping
the
matter
quiet
simple
enough
is
it
alan
turned
back
to
the
table
his
face
was
pale
he
tried
to
keep
smoke
in
front
of
his
eyes
of
course
i
do
suppose
he
allow
graham
to
escape
back
to
the
states
where
she
might
do
a
little
upsetting
on
her
own
account
he
is
throwing
the
money
away
replied
rossland
significantly
she
would
remain
here
indefinitely
indefinitely
probably
never
would
return
strange
how
squarely
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
why
should
she
return
the
world
believes
she
is
dead
papers
were
full
of
it
the
little
secret
of
her
being
alive
is
all
our
own
and
this
will
be
a
beautiful
summering
place
for
graham
magnificent
climate
lovely
flowers
birds
and
the
girl
he
has
watched
grow
up
and
wanted
since
she
was
fourteen
and
who
hates
him
true
who
was
tricked
into
marrying
him
and
who
would
rather
die
than
live
with
him
as
his
wife
but
it
up
to
graham
to
keep
her
alive
holt
that
not
our
business
if
she
dies
i
imagine
you
will
have
an
opportunity
to
get
your
range
back
pretty
cheap
rossland
held
a
paper
out
to
alan
here
partial
payment
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
i
have
the
papers
here
on
the
desk
ready
to
sign
as
soon
as
you
give
possession
i
return
to
tanana
with
you
and
make
the
remaining
payment
alan
took
the
check
i
guess
only
a
fool
would
refuse
an
offer
like
this
rossland
yes
only
a
fool
i
am
that
so
quietly
did
alan
speak
that
for
an
instant
the
significance
of
his
words
did
not
fall
with
full
force
upon
rossland
the
smoke
cleared
away
from
before
alan
face
his
cigar
dropped
to
the
floor
and
he
stepped
on
it
with
his
foot
the
check
followed
it
in
torn
scraps
the
fury
he
had
held
back
with
almost
superhuman
effort
blazed
in
his
eyes
if
i
could
have
graham
where
you
are
now
that
i
give
ten
years
of
my
life
rossland
i
would
kill
him
and
you
he
stepped
back
a
pace
as
if
to
put
himself
out
of
striking
distance
of
the
beast
who
was
staring
at
him
in
amazement
what
you
have
said
about
her
should
condemn
you
to
death
and
i
would
kill
you
here
in
this
room
if
it
was
necessary
for
you
to
take
my
message
back
to
graham
tell
him
that
mary
standish
mary
graham
is
as
pure
and
clean
and
as
sweet
as
the
day
she
was
born
tell
him
that
she
belongs
to
i
love
her
she
is
mine
do
you
understand
and
all
the
money
in
the
world
could
buy
one
hair
from
her
head
i
going
to
take
her
back
to
the
states
she
is
going
to
get
a
square
deal
and
the
world
is
going
to
know
her
story
she
has
nothing
to
conceal
absolutely
nothing
tell
that
to
john
graham
for
me
he
advanced
upon
rossland
who
had
risen
from
his
chair
his
hands
were
clenched
his
face
a
mask
of
iron
get
out
go
before
i
flay
you
within
an
inch
of
your
rotten
life
the
energy
which
every
fiber
in
him
yearned
to
expend
upon
rossland
sent
the
table
crashing
back
in
an
overturned
wreck
against
the
wall
go
before
i
kill
you
he
was
advancing
even
as
the
words
of
warning
came
from
his
lips
and
the
man
before
him
an
mass
of
flesh
that
had
forgotten
power
and
courage
in
the
face
of
a
deadly
and
unexpected
menace
backed
quickly
to
the
door
and
escaped
he
made
for
the
corrals
and
alan
watched
from
his
door
until
he
saw
him
departing
southward
accompanied
by
two
men
who
bore
packs
on
their
shoulders
not
until
then
did
rossland
gather
his
nerve
sufficiently
to
stop
and
look
back
his
breathless
voice
carried
something
unintelligible
to
alan
but
he
did
not
return
for
his
coat
and
hat
the
reaction
came
to
alan
when
he
saw
the
wreck
he
had
made
of
the
table
another
moment
or
two
and
the
devil
in
him
would
have
been
at
work
he
hated
rossland
he
hated
him
now
only
a
little
less
than
he
hated
john
graham
and
that
he
had
let
him
go
seemed
a
miracle
to
him
he
felt
the
strain
he
had
been
under
but
he
was
glad
some
little
god
of
common
sense
had
overruled
his
passion
and
he
had
acted
wisely
graham
would
now
get
his
message
and
there
could
be
no
misunderstanding
of
purpose
between
them
he
was
staring
at
the
disordered
papers
on
his
desk
when
a
movement
at
the
door
turned
him
about
mary
standish
stood
before
him
you
sent
him
away
she
cried
softly
her
eyes
were
shining
her
lips
parted
her
face
lit
up
with
a
beautiful
glow
she
saw
the
overturned
table
rossland
hat
and
coat
on
a
chair
the
evidence
of
what
had
happened
and
the
quickness
of
his
flight
and
then
she
turned
her
face
to
alan
again
and
what
he
saw
broke
down
the
last
of
that
grim
resolution
which
he
had
measured
for
himself
so
that
in
a
moment
he
was
at
her
side
and
had
her
in
his
arms
she
made
no
effort
to
free
herself
as
she
had
done
in
the
cottonwoods
but
turned
her
mouth
up
for
him
to
kiss
and
then
hid
her
face
against
his
shoulder
while
he
fighting
vainly
to
find
utterance
for
the
thousand
words
in
his
throat
stood
stroking
her
hair
and
then
buried
his
face
in
it
crying
out
at
last
in
the
warm
sweetness
of
it
that
he
loved
her
and
was
going
to
fight
for
her
and
that
no
power
on
earth
could
take
her
away
from
him
now
and
these
things
he
repeated
until
she
raised
her
flushed
face
from
his
breast
and
let
him
kiss
her
lips
once
more
and
then
freed
herself
gently
from
his
arms
chapter
xxiii
for
a
space
they
stood
apart
and
in
the
radiant
loveliness
of
mary
standish
face
and
in
alan
quiet
and
unimpassioned
attitude
were
neither
shame
nor
regret
in
a
moment
they
had
swept
aside
the
barrier
which
convention
had
raised
against
them
and
now
they
felt
the
inevitable
thrill
of
joy
and
triumph
and
not
the
humiliating
embarrassment
of
dishonor
they
made
no
effort
to
draw
a
curtain
upon
their
happiness
or
to
hide
the
swift
of
it
from
each
other
it
had
happened
and
they
were
glad
yet
they
stood
apart
and
something
pressed
upon
alan
the
inviolableness
of
the
little
freedom
of
space
between
them
of
its
sacredness
to
mary
standish
and
darker
and
deeper
grew
the
glory
of
pride
and
faith
that
lay
with
the
love
in
her
eyes
when
he
did
not
cross
it
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
freely
she
gave
him
her
own
lips
blushing
with
his
kisses
trembled
in
a
smile
and
she
bowed
her
head
a
little
so
that
he
was
looking
at
her
smooth
hair
soft
and
sweet
where
he
had
caressed
it
a
few
moments
before
i
thank
god
he
said
he
did
not
finish
the
surge
of
gratitude
that
was
in
his
heart
speech
seemed
trivial
even
futile
but
she
understood
he
was
not
thanking
god
for
that
moment
but
for
a
lifetime
of
something
that
at
last
had
come
to
him
this
it
seemed
to
him
was
the
end
the
end
of
a
world
as
he
had
known
it
the
beginning
of
a
new
he
stepped
back
and
his
hands
trembled
for
something
to
do
he
set
up
the
overturned
table
and
mary
standish
watched
him
with
a
quiet
satisfied
wonder
she
loved
him
and
she
had
come
into
his
arms
she
had
given
him
her
lips
to
kiss
and
he
laughed
softly
as
he
came
to
her
side
again
and
looked
over
the
tundra
where
rossland
had
gone
how
long
before
you
can
prepare
for
the
journey
he
asked
you
mean
that
we
must
start
tonight
or
in
the
morning
i
think
we
shall
go
through
the
cottonwoods
over
the
old
trail
to
nome
unless
rossland
lied
graham
is
somewhere
out
there
on
the
tanana
trail
her
hand
pressed
his
arm
we
are
going
is
that
it
alan
yes
to
seattle
it
is
the
one
thing
to
do
you
are
not
afraid
with
you
there
no
and
you
will
return
with
me
when
it
is
over
he
was
looking
steadily
ahead
over
the
tundra
but
he
felt
her
cheek
touch
his
shoulder
lightly
as
a
feather
yes
i
will
come
back
with
you
and
you
will
be
ready
i
am
ready
now
the
of
the
plains
danced
in
his
eyes
a
of
golden
mist
rising
out
of
the
earth
beckoning
wraiths
and
undulating
visions
the
breath
of
life
of
warmth
of
growing
things
all
between
him
and
the
hidden
cottonwoods
a
joyous
sea
into
which
he
wanted
to
plunge
without
another
minute
of
waiting
as
he
felt
the
gentle
touch
of
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
and
the
weight
of
her
hand
on
his
arm
that
she
had
come
to
him
utterly
was
in
the
low
surrender
of
her
voice
she
had
ceased
to
fight
she
had
given
to
him
the
precious
right
to
fight
for
her
it
was
this
sense
of
her
need
and
of
her
glorious
faith
in
him
and
of
the
obligation
pressing
with
it
that
drove
slowly
back
into
him
the
grimmer
realities
of
the
day
its
horror
surged
upon
him
again
and
the
significance
of
what
rossland
had
said
seemed
fresher
clearer
even
more
terrible
now
that
he
was
gone
unconsciously
the
old
lines
of
hatred
crept
into
his
face
again
as
he
looked
steadily
in
the
direction
which
the
other
man
had
taken
and
he
wondered
how
much
of
that
same
horror
of
the
unbelievable
menace
stealing
upon
her
rossland
had
divulged
to
the
girl
who
stood
so
quietly
now
at
his
side
had
he
done
right
to
let
him
go
should
he
not
have
killed
him
as
he
would
have
exterminated
a
serpent
for
rossland
had
exulted
he
was
of
flesh
and
desires
a
part
of
his
foul
soul
a
defiler
of
womanhood
and
the
one
who
had
bargained
to
make
possible
the
opportunity
for
an
indescribable
crime
it
was
not
too
late
he
could
still
overtake
him
out
there
in
the
hollows
of
the
tundra
the
pressure
on
his
arm
tightened
he
looked
down
mary
standish
had
seen
what
was
in
his
face
and
there
was
something
in
her
calmness
that
brought
him
to
himself
he
knew
in
that
moment
that
rossland
had
told
her
a
great
deal
yet
she
was
not
afraid
unless
it
was
fear
of
what
had
been
in
his
mind
i
am
ready
she
reminded
him
we
must
wait
for
stampede
he
said
reason
returning
to
him
he
should
be
here
sometime
tonight
or
in
the
morning
now
that
rossland
is
off
my
nerves
i
can
see
how
necessary
it
is
to
have
someone
like
stampede
between
us
and
he
did
not
finish
but
what
he
had
intended
to
say
was
quite
clear
to
her
she
stood
in
the
doorway
and
he
felt
an
almost
uncontrollable
desire
to
take
her
in
his
arms
again
he
is
between
here
and
tanana
she
said
with
a
little
gesture
of
her
head
rossland
told
you
that
yes
and
there
are
others
with
him
so
many
that
he
was
amused
when
i
told
him
you
would
not
let
them
take
me
away
then
you
were
not
afraid
that
i
i
might
let
them
have
you
i
have
always
been
sure
of
what
you
would
do
since
i
opened
that
second
letter
at
ellen
mccormick
alan
he
caught
the
flash
of
her
eyes
the
gladness
in
them
and
she
was
gone
before
he
could
find
another
word
to
say
keok
and
nawadlook
were
approaching
hesitatingly
but
now
they
hurried
to
meet
her
keok
still
grimly
clutching
the
long
knife
and
beyond
them
at
the
little
window
under
the
roof
he
saw
the
ghostly
face
of
old
sokwenna
like
a
on
guard
his
blood
ran
a
little
faster
the
emptiness
of
the
tundras
the
illimitable
spaces
without
sign
of
human
life
the
vast
stage
waiting
for
its
impending
drama
with
its
sunshine
its
song
of
birds
its
whisper
and
breath
of
growing
flowers
struck
a
new
note
in
him
and
he
looked
again
at
the
little
window
where
sokwenna
sat
like
a
spirit
from
another
world
warning
him
in
his
silent
and
lifeless
stare
of
something
menacing
and
deadly
creeping
upon
them
out
of
that
space
which
seemed
so
free
of
all
evil
he
beckoned
to
him
and
then
entered
his
cabin
waiting
while
sokwenna
crawled
down
from
his
post
and
came
hobbling
over
the
open
a
crooked
figure
bent
like
a
baboon
in
his
great
age
yet
with
sunken
eyes
that
gleamed
like
little
points
of
flame
and
a
quickness
of
movement
that
made
alan
shiver
as
he
watched
him
through
the
window
in
a
moment
the
old
man
entered
he
was
mumbling
he
was
saying
in
that
jumble
of
sound
which
it
was
difficult
for
even
alan
to
understand
and
which
sokwenna
had
never
given
up
for
the
missionaries
teachings
that
he
could
hear
feet
and
smell
blood
and
that
the
feet
were
many
and
the
blood
was
near
and
that
both
smell
and
footfall
were
coming
from
the
old
kloof
where
yellow
skulls
still
lay
dripping
with
the
water
that
had
once
run
red
alan
was
one
of
the
few
who
by
reason
of
much
effort
had
learned
the
story
of
the
kloof
from
old
sokwenna
how
so
long
ago
that
sokwenna
was
a
young
man
a
hostile
tribe
had
descended
upon
his
people
killing
the
men
and
stealing
the
women
and
how
at
last
sokwenna
and
a
handful
of
his
tribesmen
fled
south
with
what
women
were
left
and
made
a
final
stand
in
the
kloof
and
there
on
a
day
that
was
golden
and
filled
with
the
beauty
of
and
flowers
had
ambushed
their
enemies
and
killed
them
to
a
man
all
were
dead
now
all
but
sokwenna
for
a
space
alan
was
sorry
he
had
called
sokwenna
to
his
cabin
he
was
no
longer
the
cheerful
and
gentle
old
man
of
his
people
the
old
man
who
chortled
with
joy
at
the
prettiness
and
play
of
keok
and
nawadlook
who
loved
birds
and
flowers
and
little
children
and
who
had
retained
an
impish
boyhood
along
with
his
great
age
he
was
changed
he
stood
before
alan
an
embodiment
of
fatalism
mumbling
incoherent
things
in
his
breath
a
spirit
of
evil
omen
lurking
in
his
sunken
eyes
and
his
thin
hands
gripping
like
to
his
rifle
alan
threw
off
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
had
gripped
him
for
a
moment
and
set
him
to
an
appointed
task
the
watching
of
the
southward
plain
from
the
crest
of
a
tall
ridge
two
miles
back
on
the
tanana
trail
he
was
to
return
when
the
sun
reached
its
horizon
alan
was
inspired
now
by
a
great
caution
a
growing
premonition
which
stirred
him
with
uneasiness
and
he
began
his
own
preparations
as
soon
as
sokwenna
had
started
on
his
mission
the
desire
to
leave
at
once
without
the
delay
of
an
hour
pulled
strong
in
him
but
he
forced
himself
to
see
the
folly
of
such
haste
he
would
be
away
many
months
possibly
a
year
this
time
there
was
much
to
do
a
mass
of
detail
to
attend
to
a
volume
of
instructions
and
advice
to
leave
behind
him
he
must
at
least
see
stampede
and
it
was
necessary
to
write
down
certain
laws
for
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
as
this
work
of
preparation
progressed
and
the
premonition
persisted
in
remaining
with
him
he
fell
into
a
habit
of
repeating
to
himself
the
absurdity
of
fears
and
the
impossibility
of
danger
he
tried
to
make
himself
feel
uncomfortably
foolish
at
the
thought
of
having
ordered
the
herdsmen
in
in
all
probability
graham
would
not
appear
at
all
he
told
himself
or
at
least
not
for
many
days
or
weeks
and
if
he
did
come
it
would
be
to
war
in
a
legal
way
and
not
with
murder
yet
his
uneasiness
did
not
leave
him
as
the
hours
passed
and
the
afternoon
lengthened
the
invisible
something
urged
him
more
strongly
to
take
the
trail
beyond
the
cottonwoods
with
mary
standish
at
his
side
twice
he
saw
her
between
noon
and
five
and
by
that
time
his
writing
was
done
he
looked
at
his
guns
carefully
he
saw
that
his
favorite
rifle
and
automatic
were
working
smoothly
and
he
called
himself
a
fool
for
filling
his
ammunition
vest
with
an
extravagant
number
of
cartridges
he
even
carried
an
amount
of
this
ammunition
and
two
of
his
extra
guns
to
sokwenna
cabin
with
the
thought
that
it
was
this
cabin
on
the
edge
of
the
ravine
which
was
best
fitted
for
defense
in
the
event
of
necessity
possibly
stampede
might
have
use
for
it
and
for
the
guns
if
graham
should
come
after
he
and
mary
were
well
on
their
way
to
nome
after
supper
when
the
sun
was
throwing
long
shadows
from
the
edge
of
the
horizon
alan
came
from
a
final
survey
of
his
cabin
and
the
food
which
wegaruk
had
prepared
for
his
pack
and
found
mary
at
the
edge
of
the
ravine
watching
the
twilight
gathering
where
the
coulée
ran
narrower
and
deeper
between
the
distant
breasts
of
the
tundra
i
am
going
to
leave
you
for
a
little
while
he
said
but
sokwenna
has
returned
and
you
will
not
be
alone
where
are
you
going
as
far
as
the
cottonwoods
i
think
then
i
am
going
with
you
i
expect
to
walk
very
fast
not
faster
than
i
alan
but
i
want
to
make
sure
the
country
is
clear
in
that
direction
before
twilight
shuts
out
the
distances
i
will
help
you
her
hand
crept
into
his
i
am
going
with
you
alan
she
repeated
yes
i
think
you
are
he
laughed
joyously
and
suddenly
he
bent
his
head
and
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
in
that
way
with
her
hand
in
his
they
set
out
over
the
trail
which
they
had
not
traveled
together
since
the
day
he
had
come
from
nome
there
was
a
warm
glow
in
her
face
and
something
beautifully
soft
and
sweet
in
her
eyes
which
she
did
not
try
to
keep
away
from
him
it
made
him
forget
the
cottonwoods
and
the
plains
beyond
and
his
caution
and
sokwenna
advice
to
guard
carefully
against
the
of
ghost
kloof
and
the
country
beyond
i
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
today
she
was
saying
because
you
have
left
me
so
much
alone
i
have
been
thinking
of
and
my
thoughts
have
given
me
a
wonderful
happiness
and
i
have
been
in
paradise
he
replied
you
do
not
think
that
i
am
wicked
i
could
sooner
believe
the
sun
would
never
come
up
again
nor
that
i
have
been
unwomanly
you
are
my
dream
of
all
that
is
glorious
in
womanhood
yet
i
have
followed
you
have
thrust
myself
at
you
fairly
at
your
head
alan
for
which
i
thank
god
he
breathed
devoutly
and
i
have
told
you
that
i
love
you
and
you
have
taken
me
in
your
arms
and
have
kissed
me
yes
and
i
am
walking
now
with
my
hand
in
yours
and
will
continue
to
do
so
if
i
can
hold
it
and
i
am
another
man
wife
she
shuddered
you
are
mine
he
declared
doggedly
you
know
it
and
the
almighty
god
knows
it
it
is
blasphemy
to
speak
of
yourself
as
graham
wife
you
are
legally
entangled
with
him
and
that
is
all
heart
and
soul
and
body
you
are
free
no
i
am
not
free
but
you
are
and
then
after
a
moment
she
whispered
at
his
shoulder
alan
because
you
are
the
finest
gentleman
in
all
the
world
i
will
tell
you
why
i
am
not
it
is
because
heart
and
soul
i
belong
to
you
he
dared
not
look
at
her
and
feeling
the
struggle
within
him
mary
standish
looked
straight
ahead
with
a
wonderful
smile
on
her
lips
and
repeated
softly
yes
the
very
finest
gentleman
in
all
the
world
over
the
breasts
of
the
tundra
and
the
hollows
between
they
went
still
hand
in
hand
and
found
themselves
talking
of
the
colorings
in
the
sky
and
the
birds
and
flowers
and
the
twilight
creeping
in
about
them
while
alan
scanned
the
shortening
horizons
for
a
sign
of
human
life
one
mile
and
then
another
and
after
that
a
third
and
they
were
looking
into
gray
gloom
far
ahead
where
lay
the
kloof
it
was
strange
that
he
should
think
of
the
letter
now
the
letter
he
had
written
to
ellen
mccormick
but
think
of
it
he
did
and
said
what
was
in
his
mind
to
mary
standish
who
was
also
looking
with
him
into
the
wall
of
gloom
that
lay
between
them
and
the
distant
cottonwoods
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
not
writing
it
to
her
but
to
he
said
and
i
think
that
if
you
had
come
back
to
me
i
would
have
gone
mad
i
have
the
letter
it
is
here
and
she
placed
a
hand
upon
her
breast
do
you
remember
what
you
wrote
alan
that
you
meant
more
to
me
than
life
and
that
particularly
you
wanted
ellen
mccormick
to
keep
a
tress
of
my
hair
for
you
if
they
found
me
he
nodded
when
i
sat
across
the
table
from
you
aboard
the
i
worshiped
it
and
did
know
it
and
since
then
since
i
had
you
here
every
time
i
looked
at
you
he
stopped
choking
the
words
back
in
his
throat
say
it
alan
i
wanted
to
see
it
down
he
finished
desperately
silly
notion
is
it
why
is
it
she
asked
her
eyes
widening
a
little
if
you
love
it
why
is
it
a
silly
notion
to
want
to
see
it
down
why
i
though
possibly
you
might
think
it
so
he
added
lamely
never
had
he
heard
anything
sweeter
than
her
laughter
as
she
turned
suddenly
from
him
so
that
the
glow
of
the
fallen
sun
was
at
her
back
and
with
deft
swift
fingers
began
loosening
the
coils
of
her
hair
until
its
radiant
masses
tumbled
about
her
streaming
down
her
back
in
a
silken
glory
that
awed
him
with
its
beauty
and
drew
from
his
lips
a
cry
of
gladness
she
faced
him
and
in
her
eyes
was
the
shining
softness
that
glowed
in
her
hair
do
you
think
it
is
nice
alan
he
went
to
her
and
filled
his
hands
with
the
heavy
tresses
and
pressed
them
to
his
lips
and
face
thus
he
stood
when
he
felt
the
sudden
shiver
that
ran
through
her
it
was
like
a
little
shock
he
heard
the
catch
of
her
breath
and
the
hand
which
she
had
placed
gently
on
his
bowed
head
fell
suddenly
away
when
he
raised
his
head
to
look
at
her
she
was
staring
past
him
into
the
deepening
twilight
of
the
tundra
and
it
seemed
as
if
something
had
stricken
her
so
that
for
a
space
she
was
powerless
to
speak
or
move
what
is
it
he
cried
and
whirled
about
straining
his
eyes
to
see
what
had
alarmed
her
and
as
he
looked
a
deep
swift
shadow
sped
over
the
earth
darkening
the
mellow
twilight
until
it
was
somber
gloom
of
night
and
the
midnight
sun
went
out
like
a
great
luminous
lamp
as
a
dense
wall
of
purple
cloud
rolled
up
in
an
impenetrable
curtain
between
it
and
the
arctic
world
often
he
had
seen
this
happen
in
the
approach
of
summer
storm
on
the
tundras
but
never
had
the
change
seemed
so
swift
as
now
where
there
had
been
golden
light
he
saw
his
companion
face
now
pale
in
a
sea
of
dusk
it
was
this
miracle
of
arctic
night
its
suddenness
and
unexpectedness
that
had
startled
her
he
thought
and
he
laughed
softly
but
her
hand
clutched
his
arm
i
saw
them
she
cried
her
voice
breaking
i
saw
them
out
there
against
the
sun
before
the
cloud
came
and
some
of
them
were
running
like
animals
shadows
he
exclaimed
the
long
shadows
of
foxes
running
against
the
sun
or
of
the
big
gray
rabbits
or
of
a
wolf
and
her
sneaking
away
no
no
they
were
not
that
she
breathed
tensely
and
her
fingers
clung
more
fiercely
to
his
arm
they
were
not
shadows
were
chapter
xxiv
in
the
moment
of
stillness
between
them
when
their
hearts
seemed
to
have
stopped
beating
that
they
might
not
lose
the
faintest
whispering
of
the
twilight
a
sound
came
to
alan
and
he
knew
it
was
the
toe
of
a
boot
striking
against
stone
not
a
foot
in
his
tribe
would
have
made
that
sound
none
but
stampede
smith
or
his
own
were
they
many
he
asked
i
could
not
see
the
sun
was
darkening
but
five
or
six
were
running
behind
us
yes
and
they
saw
us
i
think
so
it
was
but
a
moment
and
they
were
a
part
of
the
dusk
he
found
her
hand
and
held
it
closely
her
fingers
clung
to
his
and
he
could
hear
her
quick
breathing
as
he
unbuttoned
the
flap
of
his
automatic
holster
you
think
have
she
whispered
and
a
cold
dread
was
in
her
voice
possibly
my
people
would
not
appear
from
that
direction
you
are
not
afraid
no
no
i
am
not
afraid
yet
you
are
trembling
it
is
this
strange
gloom
alan
never
had
the
arctic
twilight
gone
more
completely
not
half
a
dozen
times
had
he
seen
the
phenomenon
in
all
his
years
on
the
tundras
where
and
the
putting
out
of
the
summer
sun
until
twilight
thickens
into
the
gloom
of
is
an
occurrence
so
rare
that
it
is
more
awesome
than
the
weirdest
play
of
the
northern
lights
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
what
was
happening
was
a
miracle
the
play
of
a
mighty
hand
opening
their
way
to
salvation
an
inky
wall
was
shutting
out
the
world
where
the
glow
of
the
midnight
sun
should
have
been
it
was
spreading
quickly
shadows
became
part
of
the
gloom
and
this
gloom
crept
in
thickening
drawing
nearer
until
the
tundra
was
a
weird
chaos
neither
night
nor
twilight
challenging
vision
until
eyes
strained
futilely
to
penetrate
its
mystery
and
as
it
gathered
about
them
enveloping
them
in
their
own
narrowing
circle
of
vision
alan
was
thinking
quickly
it
had
taken
him
only
a
moment
to
accept
the
significance
of
the
running
figures
his
companion
had
seen
graham
men
were
near
had
seen
them
and
were
getting
between
them
and
the
range
possibly
it
was
a
scouting
party
and
if
there
were
no
more
than
five
or
six
the
number
which
mary
had
counted
he
was
quite
sure
of
the
situation
but
there
might
be
a
dozen
or
fifty
of
them
it
was
possible
graham
and
rossland
were
advancing
upon
the
range
with
their
entire
force
he
had
at
no
time
tried
to
analyze
just
what
this
force
might
be
except
to
assure
himself
that
with
the
overwhelming
influence
behind
him
both
political
and
financial
and
fired
by
a
passion
for
mary
standish
that
had
revealed
itself
as
little
short
of
madness
graham
would
hesitate
at
no
convention
of
law
or
humanity
to
achieve
his
end
probably
he
was
playing
the
game
so
that
he
would
be
shielded
by
the
technicalities
of
the
law
if
it
came
to
a
tragic
end
his
gunmen
would
undoubtedly
be
impelled
to
a
certain
extent
by
an
idea
of
authority
for
graham
was
an
injured
husband
rescuing
his
wife
while
he
alan
holt
was
the
woman
abductor
and
paramour
and
a
fit
subject
to
be
shot
upon
sight
his
free
hand
gripped
the
butt
of
his
pistol
as
he
led
the
way
straight
ahead
the
sudden
gloom
helped
to
hide
in
his
face
the
horror
he
felt
of
what
that
rescue
would
mean
to
mary
standish
and
then
a
cold
and
deadly
definiteness
possessed
him
and
every
nerve
in
his
body
gathered
itself
in
readiness
for
whatever
might
happen
if
graham
men
had
seen
them
and
were
getting
between
them
and
retreat
the
neck
of
the
trap
lay
ahead
and
in
this
direction
alan
walked
so
swiftly
that
the
girl
was
almost
running
at
his
side
he
could
not
hear
her
footsteps
so
lightly
they
fell
her
fingers
were
twined
about
his
own
and
he
could
feel
the
silken
caress
of
her
loose
hair
for
half
a
mile
he
kept
on
watching
for
a
moving
shadow
listening
for
a
sound
then
he
stopped
he
drew
mary
into
his
arms
and
held
her
there
so
that
her
head
lay
against
his
breast
she
was
panting
and
he
could
feel
and
hear
her
thumping
heart
he
found
her
parted
lips
and
kissed
them
you
are
not
afraid
he
asked
again
her
head
made
a
fierce
little
negative
movement
against
his
breast
no
he
laughed
softly
at
the
beautiful
courage
with
which
she
lied
even
if
they
saw
us
and
are
graham
men
we
have
given
them
the
slip
he
comforted
her
now
we
will
circle
eastward
back
to
the
range
i
am
sorry
i
hurried
you
so
we
will
go
more
slowly
we
must
travel
faster
she
insisted
i
want
to
run
her
fingers
sought
his
hand
and
clung
to
it
again
as
they
set
out
at
intervals
they
stopped
staring
about
them
into
nothingness
and
listening
twice
alan
thought
he
heard
sounds
which
did
not
belong
to
the
night
the
second
time
the
little
fingers
tightened
about
his
own
but
his
companion
said
no
word
only
her
breath
seemed
to
catch
in
her
throat
for
an
instant
at
the
end
of
another
it
was
growing
lighter
yet
the
breath
of
storm
seemed
nearer
the
cool
promise
of
it
touched
their
cheeks
and
about
them
were
gathering
whispers
and
eddies
of
a
thirsty
earth
rousing
to
the
sudden
change
it
was
lighter
because
the
wall
of
cloud
seemed
to
be
distributing
itself
over
the
whole
heaven
thinning
out
where
its
solid
opaqueness
had
lain
against
the
sun
alan
could
see
the
face
and
the
cloud
of
her
hair
hollows
and
ridges
of
the
tundra
were
taking
more
distinct
shape
when
they
came
into
a
dip
and
alan
recognized
a
thicket
of
willows
behind
which
a
pool
was
hidden
the
thicket
was
only
half
a
mile
from
home
a
spring
was
near
the
edge
of
the
willows
and
to
this
he
led
the
girl
made
her
a
place
to
kneel
and
showed
her
how
to
cup
the
cool
water
in
the
palms
of
her
hands
while
she
inclined
her
head
to
drink
he
held
back
her
hair
and
rested
with
his
lips
pressed
to
it
he
heard
the
trickle
of
water
running
between
her
fingers
her
little
laugh
of
which
in
another
instant
broke
into
a
startled
scream
as
he
half
gained
his
feet
to
meet
a
crashing
body
that
catapulted
at
him
from
the
concealment
of
the
willows
a
greater
commotion
in
the
thicket
followed
the
attack
then
another
voice
crying
out
sharply
a
second
cry
from
mary
standish
and
he
found
himself
on
his
knees
twisted
backward
and
fighting
desperately
to
loosen
a
pair
of
gigantic
hands
at
his
throat
he
could
hear
the
girl
struggling
but
she
did
not
cry
out
again
in
an
instant
it
seemed
his
brain
was
reeling
he
was
conscious
of
a
futile
effort
to
reach
his
gun
and
could
see
the
face
over
him
grim
and
horrible
in
the
gloom
as
the
merciless
hands
choked
the
life
from
him
then
he
heard
a
shout
a
loud
shout
filled
with
triumph
and
exultation
as
he
was
thrown
back
his
head
seemed
leaving
his
shoulders
his
body
crumbled
and
almost
spasmodically
his
leg
shot
out
with
the
last
strength
that
was
in
him
he
was
scarcely
aware
of
the
great
gasp
that
followed
but
the
fingers
loosened
at
his
throat
the
face
disappeared
and
the
man
who
was
killing
him
sank
back
for
a
precious
moment
or
two
alan
did
not
move
as
he
drew
great
breaths
of
air
into
his
lungs
then
he
felt
for
his
pistol
the
holster
was
empty
he
could
hear
the
panting
of
the
girl
her
sobbing
breath
very
near
him
and
life
and
strength
leaped
back
into
his
body
the
man
who
had
choked
him
was
advancing
again
on
hands
and
knees
in
a
flash
alan
was
up
and
on
him
like
a
lithe
cat
his
fist
beat
into
a
bearded
face
he
called
out
to
mary
as
he
struck
and
through
his
blows
saw
her
where
she
had
fallen
to
her
knees
with
a
second
hulk
bending
over
her
almost
in
the
water
of
the
little
spring
from
which
she
had
been
drinking
a
mad
curse
leaped
from
his
lips
he
was
ready
to
kill
now
he
wanted
to
kill
to
destroy
what
was
already
under
his
hands
that
he
might
leap
upon
this
other
beast
who
stood
over
mary
standish
his
hands
twisted
in
her
long
hair
dazed
by
blows
that
fell
with
the
force
of
a
club
the
bearded
man
head
sagged
backward
and
alan
fingers
dug
into
his
throat
it
was
a
bull
neck
he
tried
to
break
it
ten
seconds
twenty
half
a
minute
at
the
most
and
flesh
and
bone
would
have
given
way
but
before
the
bearded
man
gasping
cry
was
gone
from
his
lips
the
second
figure
leaped
upon
alan
he
had
no
time
to
defend
himself
from
this
new
attack
his
strength
was
half
gone
and
a
terrific
blow
sent
him
reeling
blindly
he
reached
out
and
grappled
not
until
his
arms
met
those
of
his
fresh
assailant
did
he
realize
how
much
of
himself
he
had
expended
upon
the
other
a
sickening
horror
filled
his
soul
as
he
felt
his
weakness
and
an
involuntary
moan
broke
from
his
lips
even
then
he
would
have
cut
out
his
tongue
to
have
silenced
that
sound
to
have
kept
it
from
the
girl
she
was
creeping
on
her
hands
and
knees
but
he
could
not
see
her
long
hair
trailed
in
the
trampled
earth
and
in
the
muddied
water
of
the
spring
and
her
hands
were
groping
groping
until
they
found
what
they
were
seeking
then
she
rose
to
her
feet
carrying
the
rock
on
which
one
of
her
hands
had
rested
when
she
knelt
to
drink
the
bearded
man
bringing
himself
to
his
knees
reached
out
drunkenly
but
she
avoided
him
and
poised
herself
over
alan
and
his
assailant
the
rock
descended
alan
saw
her
then
he
heard
the
one
swift
terrible
blow
and
his
enemy
rolled
away
from
him
limply
and
without
sound
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
for
a
moment
caught
the
swaying
girl
in
his
arms
the
bearded
man
was
rising
he
was
half
on
his
feet
when
alan
was
at
his
throat
again
and
they
went
down
together
the
girl
heard
blows
then
a
heavier
one
and
with
an
exclamation
of
triumph
alan
stood
up
by
chance
his
hand
had
come
in
contact
with
his
fallen
pistol
he
clicked
the
safety
down
he
was
ready
to
shoot
ready
to
continue
the
fight
with
a
gun
come
he
said
his
voice
was
gasping
strangely
unreal
and
thick
she
came
to
him
and
put
her
hand
in
his
again
and
it
was
wet
and
sticky
with
tundra
mud
from
the
spring
then
they
climbed
to
the
swell
of
the
plain
away
from
the
pool
and
the
willows
in
the
air
about
them
creeping
up
from
the
outer
darkness
of
the
strange
twilight
were
clearer
whispers
now
and
with
these
sounds
of
storm
borne
from
the
west
came
a
hallooing
voice
it
was
answered
from
straight
ahead
alan
held
the
muddied
little
hand
closer
in
his
own
and
set
out
for
the
from
which
direction
the
last
voice
had
come
he
knew
what
was
happening
graham
men
were
cleverer
than
he
had
supposed
they
had
encircled
the
tundra
side
of
the
range
and
some
of
them
were
closing
in
on
the
willow
pool
from
which
the
triumphant
shout
of
the
bearded
man
companion
had
come
they
were
wondering
why
the
call
was
not
repeated
and
were
hallooing
every
nerve
in
alan
body
was
concentrated
for
swift
and
terrible
action
for
the
desperateness
of
their
situation
had
surged
upon
him
like
a
breath
of
fire
unbelievable
and
yet
true
back
at
the
willows
they
would
have
killed
him
the
hands
at
his
throat
had
sought
his
life
wolves
and
not
men
were
about
them
on
the
plain
wolves
headed
by
two
monsters
of
the
human
pack
graham
and
rossland
murder
and
lust
and
mad
passion
were
hidden
in
the
darkness
law
and
order
and
civilization
were
hundreds
of
miles
away
if
graham
won
only
the
unmapped
tundras
would
remember
this
night
as
the
deep
dark
kloof
remembered
in
its
gloom
the
other
tragedy
of
more
than
half
a
century
ago
and
the
girl
at
his
side
already
disheveled
and
muddied
by
their
hands
his
mind
could
go
no
farther
and
angry
protest
broke
in
a
low
cry
from
his
lips
the
girl
thought
it
was
because
of
the
shadows
that
loomed
up
suddenly
in
their
path
there
were
two
of
them
and
she
too
cried
out
as
voices
commanded
them
to
stop
alan
caught
a
swift
of
an
arm
but
his
own
was
quicker
three
spurts
of
flame
darted
in
lightning
flashes
from
his
pistol
and
the
man
who
had
raised
his
arm
crumpled
to
the
earth
while
the
other
dissolved
swiftly
into
the
a
moment
later
his
wild
shouts
were
assembling
the
pack
while
the
detonations
of
alan
pistol
continued
to
roll
over
the
tundra
the
unexpectedness
of
the
shots
their
tragic
effect
the
falling
of
the
stricken
man
and
the
flight
of
the
other
brought
no
word
from
mary
standish
but
her
breath
was
sobbing
and
in
the
lifting
of
the
purplish
gloom
she
turned
her
face
for
an
instant
to
alan
tensely
white
with
eyes
her
hair
covered
her
like
a
shining
veil
and
where
it
clustered
in
a
disheveled
mass
upon
her
breast
alan
saw
her
hand
thrusting
itself
forward
from
its
clinging
concealment
and
in
it
to
his
amazement
was
a
pistol
he
recognized
the
weapon
one
of
a
brace
of
light
automatics
which
his
friend
carl
lomen
had
presented
to
him
several
christmas
seasons
ago
pride
and
a
strange
exultation
swept
over
him
until
now
she
had
concealed
the
weapon
but
all
along
she
had
prepared
to
fight
to
fight
with
against
their
enemies
he
wanted
to
stop
and
take
her
in
his
arms
and
with
his
kisses
tell
her
how
splendid
she
was
but
instead
of
this
he
sped
more
swiftly
ahead
and
they
came
into
the
bottom
which
lay
in
a
narrow
barrier
between
them
and
the
range
through
this
ran
a
trail
scarcely
wider
than
a
made
through
the
sea
of
hummocks
and
and
mucky
pitfalls
by
the
axes
and
shovels
of
his
people
finding
this
alan
stopped
for
a
moment
knowing
that
safety
lay
ahead
of
them
the
girl
leaned
against
him
and
then
was
almost
a
dead
weight
in
his
arms
the
last
two
hundred
yards
had
taken
the
strength
from
her
body
her
pale
face
dropped
back
and
alan
brushed
the
soft
hair
away
from
it
and
kissed
her
lips
and
her
eyes
while
the
pistol
lay
clenched
against
his
breast
even
then
too
to
speak
she
smiled
at
him
and
alan
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
and
darted
into
the
narrow
path
which
he
knew
their
pursuers
would
not
immediately
find
if
they
could
bet
beyond
their
vision
he
was
joyously
amazed
at
her
lightness
she
was
like
a
child
in
his
arms
a
glorious
little
goddess
hidden
and
smothered
in
her
long
hair
and
he
held
her
closer
as
he
hurried
toward
the
cabins
conscious
of
the
soft
tightening
of
her
arms
about
his
neck
feeling
the
sweet
caress
of
her
panting
breath
strengthened
and
made
happy
by
her
helplessness
thus
they
came
out
of
the
bottom
as
the
first
mist
of
slowly
approaching
rain
touched
his
face
he
could
see
farther
now
back
over
the
narrow
trail
he
climbed
a
slope
and
here
mary
standish
slipped
from
his
arms
and
stood
with
new
strength
looking
into
his
face
his
breath
was
coming
in
little
breaks
and
he
pointed
faintly
they
could
make
out
the
shadows
of
the
corral
buildings
beyond
them
were
no
lights
penetrating
the
gloom
from
the
windows
of
the
range
of
houses
the
silence
of
the
place
was
and
then
something
grew
out
of
the
earth
almost
at
their
feet
a
hollow
cry
followed
the
movement
a
cry
that
was
ghostly
and
shivering
and
loud
enough
only
for
them
to
hear
and
sokwenna
stood
at
their
side
he
talked
swiftly
only
alan
understood
there
was
something
unearthly
and
spectral
in
his
appearance
his
hair
and
beard
were
wet
his
eyes
shot
here
and
there
in
little
points
of
fire
he
was
like
a
gnome
weirdly
uncanny
as
he
gestured
and
talked
in
his
monotone
while
he
watched
the
bottom
when
he
had
finished
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
but
turned
and
led
the
way
swiftly
toward
the
range
houses
what
did
he
say
asked
the
girl
that
he
is
glad
we
are
back
he
heard
the
shots
and
came
to
meet
us
and
what
else
she
persisted
old
sokwenna
is
superstitious
and
nervous
he
said
some
things
that
you
would
understand
you
would
probably
think
him
mad
if
he
told
you
the
spirits
of
his
comrades
slain
in
the
kloof
many
years
ago
were
here
with
him
tonight
warning
him
of
things
about
to
happen
anyway
he
has
been
cautious
no
sooner
were
we
out
of
sight
than
he
hustled
every
woman
and
child
in
the
village
on
their
way
to
the
mountains
keok
and
nawadlook
would
go
i
glad
of
that
for
if
they
were
pursued
and
overtaken
by
men
like
graham
and
rossland
death
would
be
better
finished
mary
standish
and
her
hand
clung
more
tightly
to
his
arm
yes
i
think
so
but
that
can
not
happen
now
out
in
the
open
they
had
us
at
a
disadvantage
but
we
can
hold
sokwenna
place
until
stampede
and
the
herdsmen
come
with
two
good
rifles
inside
they
wo
dare
to
assault
the
cabin
with
their
naked
hands
the
advantage
is
all
ours
now
we
can
shoot
but
they
wo
risk
the
use
of
their
rifles
why
because
you
will
be
inside
graham
wants
you
alive
not
dead
and
bullets
they
had
reached
sokwenna
door
and
in
that
moment
they
hesitated
and
turned
their
faces
back
to
the
gloom
out
of
which
they
had
fled
voices
came
suddenly
from
beyond
the
corrals
there
was
no
effort
at
concealment
the
buildings
were
discovered
and
men
called
out
loudly
and
were
answered
from
half
a
dozen
points
out
on
the
tundra
they
could
hear
running
feet
and
sharp
commands
some
were
cursing
where
they
were
entangled
among
the
and
the
sound
of
hurrying
foes
came
from
the
edge
of
the
ravine
alan
heart
stood
still
there
was
something
terribly
swift
and
businesslike
in
this
gathering
of
their
enemies
he
could
hear
them
at
his
cabin
doors
opened
a
window
fell
in
with
a
crash
lights
flared
up
through
the
gray
mist
it
was
then
from
the
barricaded
attic
window
over
their
heads
that
sokwenna
rifle
answered
a
single
shot
a
shriek
and
then
a
pale
stream
of
flame
leaped
out
from
the
window
as
the
old
warrior
emptied
his
gun
before
the
last
of
the
five
swift
shots
were
fired
alan
was
in
the
cabin
barring
the
door
behind
him
shaded
candles
burned
on
the
floor
and
beside
them
crouched
keok
and
nawadlook
a
glance
told
him
what
sokwenna
had
done
the
room
was
an
arsenal
guns
lay
there
ready
to
be
used
heaps
of
cartridges
were
piled
near
them
and
in
the
eyes
of
keok
and
nawadlook
blazed
deep
and
steady
fires
as
they
held
shining
cartridges
between
their
fingers
ready
to
thrust
them
into
the
rifle
chambers
as
fast
as
the
guns
were
emptied
in
the
center
of
the
room
stood
mary
standish
the
candles
shaded
so
they
would
not
disclose
the
windows
faintly
illumined
her
pale
face
and
unbound
hair
and
revealed
the
horror
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
alan
he
was
about
to
speak
to
assure
her
there
was
no
danger
that
men
would
fire
upon
the
cabin
when
hell
broke
suddenly
loose
out
in
the
night
the
savage
roar
of
guns
answered
sokwenna
fusillade
and
a
hail
of
bullets
crashed
against
the
log
walls
two
of
them
found
their
way
through
the
windows
like
hissing
serpents
and
with
a
single
movement
alan
was
at
mary
side
and
had
crumpled
her
down
on
the
floor
beside
keok
and
nawadlook
his
face
was
white
his
brain
a
furnace
of
sudden
consuming
fire
i
thought
they
would
shoot
at
women
he
said
and
his
voice
was
terrifying
in
its
strange
hardness
i
was
mistaken
and
i
am
sure
now
that
i
understand
with
his
rifle
he
cautiously
approached
the
window
he
was
no
longer
guessing
at
an
elusive
truth
he
knew
what
graham
was
thinking
what
he
was
planning
what
he
intended
to
do
and
the
thing
was
appalling
both
he
and
rossland
knew
there
would
be
some
way
of
sheltering
mary
standish
in
sokwenna
cabin
they
were
accepting
a
desperate
gamble
believing
that
alan
holt
would
find
a
safe
place
for
her
while
he
fought
until
he
fell
it
was
the
finesse
of
clever
scheming
nothing
less
than
murder
and
he
by
this
combination
of
circumstances
and
plot
was
the
victim
marked
for
death
the
shooting
had
stopped
and
the
silence
that
followed
it
held
a
significance
for
alan
they
were
giving
him
an
allotted
time
in
which
to
care
for
those
under
his
protection
a
was
in
the
floor
of
sokwenna
cabin
it
opened
into
a
small
storeroom
and
cellar
which
in
turn
possessed
an
air
vent
leading
to
the
outside
overlooking
the
ravine
in
the
alan
saw
the
door
of
this
trap
propped
open
with
a
stick
sokwenna
too
was
clever
sokwenna
had
foreseen
crouched
under
the
window
he
looked
at
the
girls
keok
with
a
rifle
in
her
hand
had
crept
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
leading
up
to
the
attic
and
began
to
climb
it
she
was
going
to
sokwenna
to
load
for
him
alan
pointed
to
the
open
trap
quick
get
into
that
he
cried
it
is
the
only
safe
place
you
can
load
there
and
hand
out
the
guns
mary
standish
looked
at
him
steadily
but
did
not
move
she
was
clutching
a
rifle
in
her
hands
and
nawadlook
did
not
move
but
keok
climbed
steadily
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
above
go
into
the
cellar
commanded
alan
good
god
if
you
do
a
smile
lit
up
mary
face
in
that
hour
of
deadly
peril
it
was
like
a
ray
of
glorious
light
leading
the
way
through
blackness
a
smile
sweet
and
gentle
and
unafraid
and
slowly
she
crept
toward
alan
dragging
the
rifle
in
one
hand
and
holding
the
little
pistol
in
the
other
and
from
his
feet
she
still
smiled
up
at
him
through
the
dishevelment
of
her
shining
hair
and
in
a
quiet
little
voice
that
thrilled
him
she
said
i
am
going
to
help
you
fight
nawadlook
came
creeping
after
her
dragging
another
rifle
and
bearing
an
apron
heavy
with
the
weight
of
cartridges
and
above
through
the
darkened
loophole
of
the
attic
window
ferret
eyes
had
caught
the
movement
of
a
shadow
in
the
gray
mist
and
his
rifle
sent
its
once
more
to
john
graham
and
his
men
what
followed
struck
a
smile
from
mary
lips
and
a
moaning
sob
rose
from
her
breast
as
she
watched
the
man
she
loved
rise
up
before
the
open
window
to
face
the
winged
death
that
was
again
beating
a
tattoo
against
the
log
walls
of
the
cabin
chapter
xxv
that
in
the
lust
and
passion
of
his
designs
and
the
arrogance
of
his
power
john
graham
was
not
afraid
to
overstep
all
law
and
order
and
that
he
believed
holt
would
shelter
mary
standish
from
injury
and
death
there
could
no
longer
be
a
doubt
after
the
first
few
swift
moments
following
sokwenna
from
the
attic
window
through
the
window
of
the
lower
room
barricaded
by
the
cautious
old
warrior
until
its
aperture
was
not
more
than
eight
inches
square
alan
thrust
his
rifle
as
the
crash
of
broke
the
gray
and
thickening
mist
of
night
he
could
hear
the
thud
and
hiss
of
bullets
he
heard
them
singing
like
angry
bees
as
they
passed
with
the
swiftness
of
over
the
cabin
roof
and
their
patter
against
the
log
walls
was
like
the
hollow
drumming
of
knuckles
against
the
side
of
a
ripe
watermelon
there
was
something
fascinating
and
almost
gentle
about
that
last
sound
it
did
not
seem
that
the
horror
of
death
was
riding
with
it
and
alan
lost
all
sense
of
fear
as
he
stared
in
the
direction
from
which
the
firing
came
trying
to
make
out
shadows
at
which
to
shoot
here
and
there
he
saw
dim
white
streaks
and
at
these
he
fired
as
fast
as
he
could
throw
cartridges
into
the
chamber
and
pull
the
trigger
then
he
crouched
down
with
the
empty
gun
it
was
mary
standish
who
held
out
a
freshly
loaded
weapon
to
him
her
face
was
waxen
in
its
deathly
pallor
her
eyes
staring
at
him
so
strangely
never
for
an
instant
leaving
his
face
were
lustrous
with
the
agony
of
fear
that
flamed
in
their
depths
she
was
not
afraid
for
herself
it
was
for
his
name
was
on
her
lips
a
whisper
unspoken
a
breathless
prayer
and
in
that
instant
a
bullet
sped
through
the
opening
in
front
of
which
he
had
stood
a
moment
before
a
hissing
writhing
serpent
of
death
that
struck
something
behind
them
in
its
venomous
wrath
with
a
cry
she
flung
up
her
arms
about
his
bent
head
my
god
they
will
kill
you
if
you
stand
there
she
moaned
give
me
up
to
them
alan
if
you
love
me
give
me
up
a
sudden
spurt
of
white
dust
shot
out
into
the
dim
and
then
another
so
near
nawadlook
that
his
blood
went
cold
bullets
were
finding
their
way
through
the
moss
and
earth
chinking
between
the
logs
of
the
cabin
his
arms
closed
in
a
fierce
embrace
about
the
girl
slim
body
and
before
she
could
realize
what
was
happening
he
leaped
to
the
trap
with
her
and
almost
flung
her
into
its
protection
then
he
forced
nawadlook
down
beside
her
and
after
them
he
thrust
in
the
empty
gun
and
the
apron
with
its
weight
of
cartridges
his
face
was
demoniac
in
its
command
if
you
do
stay
there
i
open
the
door
and
go
outside
to
fight
do
you
understand
there
his
clenched
fist
was
in
their
faces
his
voice
almost
a
shout
he
saw
another
white
spurt
of
dust
the
bullet
crashed
in
tinware
and
following
the
crash
came
a
shriek
from
keok
in
the
attic
in
that
upper
gloom
sokwenna
gun
had
fallen
with
a
clatter
the
old
warrior
bent
himself
over
nearly
double
and
with
his
two
withered
hands
was
clutching
his
stomach
he
was
on
his
knees
and
his
breath
suddenly
came
in
a
panting
gasping
cry
then
he
straightened
slowly
and
said
something
reassuring
to
keok
and
faced
the
window
again
with
the
gun
which
she
had
loaded
for
him
the
scream
had
scarcely
gone
from
keok
lips
when
alan
was
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
calling
her
she
came
to
him
through
the
stark
blackness
of
the
room
sobbing
that
sokwenna
was
hit
and
alan
reached
out
and
seized
her
and
dragged
her
down
and
placed
her
with
nawadlook
and
mary
standish
from
them
he
turned
to
the
window
and
his
soul
cried
out
madly
for
the
power
to
see
to
kill
to
avenge
as
if
in
answer
to
this
prayer
for
light
and
vision
he
saw
his
cabin
strangely
illumined
dancing
yellow
radiance
silhouetted
the
windows
and
a
stream
of
it
billowed
out
through
an
open
door
into
the
night
it
was
so
bright
he
could
see
the
scarcely
heavier
than
a
dense
slowly
descending
fog
a
wet
blanket
of
vapor
moistening
the
earth
his
heart
jumped
as
with
each
second
the
blaze
of
light
increased
they
had
set
fire
to
his
cabin
they
were
no
longer
white
men
but
savages
he
was
terribly
cool
even
as
his
heart
throbbed
so
violently
he
watched
with
the
eyes
of
a
deadly
hunter
over
his
sokwenna
was
still
probably
he
was
dead
keok
was
sobbing
in
the
then
he
saw
a
shape
growing
in
the
illumination
three
or
four
of
them
moving
alive
he
waited
until
they
were
clearer
and
he
knew
what
they
were
thinking
that
the
cabin
had
lost
its
power
to
fight
he
prayed
god
it
was
graham
he
was
aiming
at
and
fired
the
figure
went
down
sank
into
the
earth
as
a
dead
man
falls
steadily
he
fired
at
the
others
one
two
three
four
and
two
out
of
the
four
he
hit
and
the
exultant
thought
flashed
upon
him
that
it
was
good
shooting
under
the
circumstances
he
sprang
back
for
another
gun
and
it
was
mary
who
was
waiting
for
him
head
and
shoulders
out
of
the
the
rifle
in
her
hands
she
was
sobbing
as
she
looked
straight
at
him
yet
without
moisture
or
tears
in
her
eyes
keep
down
he
warned
keep
down
below
the
floor
he
guessed
what
was
coming
he
had
shown
his
enemies
that
life
still
existed
in
the
cabin
life
with
death
in
its
hands
and
now
from
the
shelter
of
the
other
cabins
from
the
darkness
from
beyond
the
light
of
his
flaming
home
the
rifle
fire
continued
to
grow
until
it
filled
the
night
with
a
horrible
din
he
flung
himself
upon
the
floor
so
that
the
lower
log
of
the
building
protected
him
no
living
thing
could
have
stood
up
against
what
was
happening
in
these
moments
bullets
tore
through
the
windows
and
between
the
logs
crashing
against
metal
and
glass
and
tinware
one
of
the
candles
sputtered
and
went
out
and
in
this
hell
alan
heard
a
cry
and
saw
mary
standish
coming
out
of
the
toward
him
he
had
flung
himself
down
quickly
and
she
thought
he
was
hit
he
shrieked
at
her
and
his
heart
froze
with
horror
as
he
saw
a
heavy
tress
of
her
hair
drop
to
the
floor
as
she
stood
there
in
that
frightful
moment
white
and
glorious
in
the
face
of
the
before
she
could
move
another
step
he
was
at
her
side
and
with
her
in
his
arms
leaped
into
the
pit
a
bullet
sang
over
them
he
crushed
her
so
close
that
for
a
breath
or
two
life
seemed
to
leave
her
body
a
sudden
draught
of
cool
air
struck
his
face
he
missed
nawadlook
in
the
deeper
gloom
farther
under
the
floor
he
heard
her
moving
and
saw
a
faint
square
of
light
she
was
creeping
back
her
hands
touched
his
arm
we
can
get
away
there
she
cried
in
a
low
voice
i
have
opened
the
little
door
we
can
crawl
through
it
and
into
the
ravine
her
words
and
the
square
of
light
were
an
inspiration
he
had
not
dreamed
that
graham
would
turn
the
cabin
into
a
and
nawadlook
words
filled
him
with
a
sudden
thrilling
hope
the
rifle
fire
was
dying
away
again
as
he
gave
voice
to
his
plan
in
sharp
swift
words
he
would
hold
the
cabin
as
long
as
he
was
there
graham
and
his
men
would
not
dare
to
rush
it
at
least
they
would
hesitate
a
considerable
time
before
doing
that
and
meanwhile
the
girls
could
steal
down
into
the
ravine
there
was
no
one
on
that
side
to
intercept
them
and
both
keok
and
nawadlook
were
well
acquainted
with
the
trails
into
the
mountains
it
would
mean
safety
for
them
he
would
remain
in
the
cabin
and
fight
until
stampede
smith
and
the
herdsmen
came
the
white
face
against
his
breast
was
cold
and
almost
expressionless
something
in
it
frightened
him
he
knew
his
argument
had
failed
and
that
mary
standish
would
not
go
yet
she
did
not
answer
him
nor
did
her
lips
move
in
the
effort
go
for
sakes
if
not
for
your
own
and
mine
he
insisted
holding
her
away
from
him
good
god
think
what
it
will
mean
if
beasts
like
those
out
there
get
hold
of
keok
and
nawadlook
graham
is
your
husband
and
will
protect
you
for
himself
but
for
them
there
will
be
no
hope
no
salvation
nothing
but
a
fate
more
terrible
than
death
they
will
be
like
like
two
beautiful
lambs
thrown
among
wolves
broken
destroyed
her
eyes
were
burning
with
horror
keok
was
sobbing
and
a
moan
which
she
bravely
tried
to
smother
in
her
breast
came
from
nawadlook
and
whispered
mary
i
must
remain
here
it
is
the
only
way
dumbly
she
allowed
him
to
lead
her
back
with
keok
and
nawadlook
keok
went
through
the
opening
first
then
nawadlook
and
mary
standish
last
she
did
not
touch
him
again
she
made
no
movement
toward
him
and
said
no
word
and
all
he
remembered
of
her
when
she
was
gone
in
the
gloom
was
her
eyes
in
that
last
look
she
had
given
him
her
soul
and
no
whisper
no
farewell
caress
came
with
it
go
cautiously
until
you
are
out
of
the
ravine
then
hurry
toward
the
mountains
were
his
last
words
he
saw
their
forms
fade
into
dim
shadows
and
the
gray
mist
swallowed
them
he
hurried
back
seized
a
loaded
gun
and
sprang
to
the
window
knowing
that
he
must
continue
to
deal
death
until
he
was
killed
only
in
that
way
could
he
hold
graham
back
and
give
those
who
had
escaped
a
chance
for
their
lives
cautiously
he
looked
out
over
his
gun
barrel
his
cabin
was
a
furnace
red
with
flame
streams
of
fire
were
licking
out
at
the
windows
and
through
the
door
and
as
he
sought
vainly
for
a
movement
of
life
the
crackling
roar
of
it
came
to
his
ears
and
so
swiftly
that
his
breath
choked
him
the
walls
became
sheets
of
conflagration
until
the
cabin
was
a
seething
torch
of
fire
whose
illumination
was
more
dazzling
than
the
sun
of
day
out
into
this
illumination
suddenly
stalked
a
figure
waving
a
white
sheet
at
the
end
of
a
long
pole
it
advanced
slowly
a
little
hesitatingly
at
first
as
if
doubtful
of
what
might
happen
and
then
it
stopped
full
in
the
light
an
easy
mark
for
a
rifle
aimed
from
sokwenna
cabin
he
saw
who
it
was
then
and
drew
in
his
rifle
and
watched
the
unexpected
maneuver
in
amazement
the
man
was
rossland
in
spite
of
the
dramatic
tenseness
of
the
moment
alan
could
not
repress
the
grim
smile
that
came
to
his
lips
rossland
was
a
man
of
illogical
resource
he
meditated
only
a
short
time
ago
he
had
fled
ignominiously
through
fear
of
personal
violence
while
now
with
a
courage
that
could
not
fail
to
rouse
admiration
he
was
exposing
himself
to
a
swift
and
sudden
death
protected
only
by
the
symbol
of
truce
over
his
head
that
he
owed
this
symbol
either
regard
or
honor
did
not
for
an
instant
possess
alan
a
murderer
held
it
a
man
even
more
vile
than
a
murderer
if
such
a
creature
existed
on
earth
and
for
such
a
man
death
was
a
righteous
end
only
rossland
nerve
and
what
he
might
have
to
say
held
back
the
vengeance
within
reach
of
alan
hand
he
waited
and
rossland
again
advanced
and
did
not
stop
until
he
was
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
cabin
a
sudden
disturbing
thought
flashed
upon
alan
as
he
heard
his
name
called
he
had
seen
no
other
figures
no
other
shadows
beyond
rossland
and
the
burning
cabin
now
clearly
illumined
the
windows
of
sokwenna
place
was
it
conceivable
that
rossland
was
merely
a
lure
and
the
instant
he
exposed
himself
in
a
parley
a
score
of
hidden
rifles
would
reveal
their
treachery
he
shuddered
and
held
himself
below
the
opening
of
the
window
graham
and
his
men
were
more
than
capable
of
such
a
crime
rossland
voice
rose
above
the
crackle
and
roar
of
the
burning
cabin
alan
holt
are
you
there
yes
i
am
here
shouted
alan
and
i
have
a
line
on
your
heart
rossland
and
my
finger
is
on
the
trigger
what
do
you
want
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
as
if
the
thought
of
what
he
was
facing
had
at
last
stricken
rossland
dumb
then
he
said
we
are
giving
you
a
last
chance
holt
for
god
sake
do
be
a
fool
the
offer
i
made
you
today
is
still
good
if
you
do
accept
it
the
law
must
take
its
course
law
alan
voice
was
a
savage
cry
yes
the
law
the
law
is
with
us
we
have
the
proper
authority
to
recover
a
stolen
wife
a
captive
a
prisoner
held
in
restraint
with
felonious
intent
but
we
do
want
to
press
the
law
unless
we
are
forced
to
do
so
you
and
the
old
eskimo
have
killed
three
of
our
men
and
wounded
two
others
that
means
the
hangman
if
we
take
you
alive
but
we
are
willing
to
forget
that
if
you
will
accept
the
offer
i
made
you
today
what
do
you
say
alan
was
stunned
speech
failed
him
as
he
realized
the
monstrous
assurance
with
which
graham
and
rossland
were
playing
their
game
and
when
he
made
no
answer
rossland
continued
to
drive
home
his
arguments
believing
that
at
last
alan
was
at
the
point
of
surrender
up
in
the
dark
attic
the
voices
had
come
like
whispers
to
old
sokwenna
he
lay
huddled
at
the
window
and
the
chill
of
death
was
creeping
over
him
but
the
voices
roused
him
they
were
not
strange
voices
but
voices
which
came
up
out
of
a
past
of
many
years
ago
calling
upon
him
urging
him
persisting
in
his
ears
with
cries
of
vengeance
and
of
triumph
the
call
of
familiar
names
a
moaning
of
women
a
sobbing
of
children
shadowy
hands
helped
him
and
a
last
time
he
raised
himself
to
the
window
and
his
eyes
were
filled
with
the
glare
of
the
burning
cabin
he
struggled
to
lift
his
rifle
and
behind
him
he
heard
the
exultation
of
his
people
as
he
rested
it
over
the
sill
and
with
gasping
breath
leveled
it
at
something
which
moved
between
him
and
the
blazing
light
of
that
wonderful
sun
which
was
the
burning
cabin
and
then
slowly
and
with
difficulty
he
pressed
the
trigger
and
last
shot
sped
on
its
mission
at
the
sound
of
the
shot
alan
looked
through
the
window
for
a
moment
rossland
stood
motionless
then
the
pole
in
his
hands
wavered
drooped
and
fell
to
the
earth
and
rossland
sank
down
after
it
making
no
sound
and
lay
a
dark
and
huddled
blot
on
the
ground
the
appalling
swiftness
and
ease
with
which
rossland
had
passed
from
life
into
death
shocked
every
nerve
in
alan
body
horror
for
a
brief
space
stupefied
him
and
he
continued
to
stare
at
the
dark
and
motionless
blot
forgetful
of
his
own
danger
while
a
grim
and
terrible
silence
followed
the
shot
and
then
what
seemed
to
be
a
single
cry
broke
that
silence
though
it
was
made
up
of
many
men
voices
deadly
and
thrilling
it
was
a
message
that
set
alan
into
action
rossland
had
been
killed
under
a
flag
of
truce
and
even
the
men
under
graham
had
something
like
respect
for
that
symbol
he
could
expect
no
mercy
nothing
now
but
the
most
terrible
of
vengeance
at
their
hands
and
as
he
dodged
back
from
the
window
he
cursed
sokwenna
under
his
breath
even
as
he
felt
the
relief
of
knowing
he
was
not
dead
before
a
shot
had
been
fired
from
outside
he
was
up
the
ladder
in
another
moment
he
was
bending
over
the
huddled
form
of
the
old
eskimo
come
below
he
commanded
we
must
be
ready
to
leave
through
the
his
hand
touched
sokwenna
face
it
hesitated
groped
in
the
darkness
and
then
grew
still
over
the
old
warrior
heart
there
was
no
tremor
or
beat
of
life
in
the
aged
beast
sokwenna
was
dead
the
guns
of
graham
men
opened
fire
again
volley
after
volley
crashed
into
the
cabin
as
alan
descended
the
ladder
he
could
hear
bullets
tearing
through
the
chinks
and
windows
as
he
turned
quickly
to
the
shelter
of
the
pit
he
was
amazed
to
find
that
mary
standish
had
returned
and
was
waiting
for
him
there
chapter
xxvi
in
the
astonishment
with
which
mary
unexpected
presence
confused
him
for
a
moment
alan
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
trap
staring
down
at
her
pale
face
heedless
of
the
terrific
that
was
assailing
the
cabin
that
she
had
not
gone
with
keok
and
nawadlook
but
had
come
back
to
him
filled
him
with
instant
dread
for
the
precious
minutes
he
had
fought
for
were
lost
and
the
priceless
time
gained
during
the
parley
with
rossland
counted
for
nothing
she
saw
his
disappointment
and
his
danger
and
sprang
up
to
seize
his
hand
and
pull
him
down
beside
her
of
course
you
did
expect
me
to
go
she
said
in
a
voice
that
no
longer
trembled
or
betrayed
excitement
you
did
want
me
to
be
a
coward
my
place
is
with
you
he
could
make
no
answer
to
that
with
her
beautiful
eyes
looking
at
him
as
they
were
but
he
felt
his
heart
grow
warmer
and
something
rise
up
chokingly
in
his
throat
sokwenna
is
dead
and
rossland
lies
out
there
shot
under
a
flag
of
truce
he
said
we
ca
have
many
minutes
left
to
us
he
was
looking
at
the
square
of
light
where
the
tunnel
from
the
opened
into
the
ravine
he
had
planned
to
escape
through
it
alone
and
keep
up
a
fight
in
the
open
but
with
mary
at
his
side
it
would
be
a
desperate
gantlet
to
run
where
are
keok
and
nawadlook
he
asked
on
the
tundra
hurrying
for
the
mountains
i
told
them
it
was
your
plan
that
i
should
return
to
you
when
they
doubted
i
threatened
to
give
myself
up
unless
they
did
as
i
commanded
them
and
alan
the
ravine
is
filled
with
the
and
dark
she
was
holding
his
free
hand
closely
to
her
breast
it
is
our
one
chance
he
said
and
are
you
glad
a
little
glad
that
i
did
run
away
without
you
even
then
he
saw
the
sweet
and
tremulous
play
of
her
lips
as
they
smiled
at
him
in
the
gloom
and
heard
the
soft
note
in
her
voice
that
was
almost
playfully
chiding
and
the
glory
of
her
love
as
she
had
proved
it
to
him
there
drew
from
him
what
he
knew
to
be
the
truth
yes
i
am
glad
it
is
strange
that
i
should
be
so
happy
in
a
moment
like
this
if
they
will
give
us
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
led
the
way
quickly
to
the
square
of
light
and
was
first
to
creep
forth
into
the
thick
mist
it
was
scarcely
rain
yet
he
could
feel
the
wet
particles
of
it
and
through
this
saturated
gloom
whining
bullets
cut
like
knives
over
his
head
the
blazing
cabin
illumined
the
open
on
each
side
of
sokwenna
place
but
deepened
the
shadows
in
the
ravine
and
a
few
seconds
later
they
stood
hand
in
hand
in
the
blanket
of
fog
that
hid
the
coulée
suddenly
the
shots
grew
scattering
above
them
then
ceased
entirely
this
was
not
what
alan
had
hoped
for
graham
men
enraged
and
made
desperate
by
rossland
death
would
rush
the
cabin
immediately
scarcely
had
the
thought
leaped
into
his
mind
when
he
heard
swiftly
approaching
shouts
the
trampling
of
feet
and
then
the
battering
of
some
heavy
object
at
the
barricaded
door
of
sokwenna
cabin
in
another
minute
or
two
their
escape
would
be
discovered
and
a
horde
of
men
would
pour
down
into
the
ravine
mary
tugged
at
his
hand
let
us
hurry
she
pleaded
what
happened
then
seemed
madness
to
the
girl
for
alan
turned
and
with
her
hand
held
tightly
in
his
started
up
the
side
of
the
ravine
apparently
in
the
face
of
their
enemies
her
heart
throbbed
with
sudden
fear
when
their
course
came
almost
within
the
circle
of
light
made
by
the
burning
cabin
like
shadows
they
sped
into
the
deeper
shelter
of
the
corral
buildings
and
not
until
they
paused
there
did
she
understand
the
significance
of
the
hazardous
chance
they
had
taken
already
men
were
pouring
into
the
ravine
they
wo
suspect
we
doubled
on
them
until
it
is
too
late
said
alan
exultantly
we
make
for
the
kloof
stampede
and
the
herdsmen
should
arrive
within
a
few
hours
and
when
that
happens
a
stifled
moan
interrupted
him
half
a
dozen
paces
away
a
crumpled
figure
lay
huddled
against
one
of
the
corral
gates
he
is
hurt
whispered
mary
after
a
moment
of
silence
i
hope
so
replied
alan
pitilessly
it
will
be
unfortunate
for
us
if
he
lives
to
tell
his
comrades
we
have
passed
this
way
something
in
his
voice
made
the
girl
shiver
it
was
as
if
the
vanishing
point
of
mercy
had
been
reached
and
savages
were
at
their
backs
she
heard
the
wounded
man
moan
again
as
they
stole
through
the
deeper
shadows
of
the
corrals
toward
the
bottom
and
then
she
noticed
that
the
mist
was
no
longer
in
her
face
the
sky
was
clearing
she
could
see
alan
more
clearly
and
when
they
came
to
the
narrow
trail
over
which
they
had
fled
once
before
that
night
it
reached
out
ahead
of
them
like
a
thin
dark
ribbon
scarcely
had
they
reached
this
point
when
a
rifle
shot
sounded
not
far
behind
it
was
followed
by
a
second
and
a
third
and
after
that
came
a
shout
it
was
not
a
loud
shout
there
was
something
strained
and
ghastly
about
it
and
yet
it
came
distinctly
to
them
the
wounded
man
said
alan
in
a
voice
of
dismay
he
is
calling
the
others
i
should
have
killed
him
he
traveled
at
a
and
the
girl
ran
lightly
at
his
side
all
her
courage
and
endurance
had
returned
she
breathed
easily
and
quickened
her
steps
so
that
she
was
setting
the
pace
for
alan
they
passed
along
the
crest
of
the
ridge
under
which
lay
the
willows
and
the
pool
and
at
the
end
of
this
they
paused
to
rest
and
listen
trained
to
the
varied
night
whisperings
of
the
tundras
alan
ears
caught
faint
sounds
which
his
companion
did
not
hear
the
wounded
man
had
succeeded
in
giving
his
message
and
pursuers
were
scattering
over
the
plain
behind
them
can
you
run
a
little
farther
he
asked
where
he
pointed
and
she
darted
ahead
of
him
her
dark
hair
streaming
in
a
cloud
that
began
to
catch
a
faint
luster
of
increasing
light
alan
ran
a
little
behind
her
he
was
afraid
of
the
light
only
gloom
had
saved
them
this
night
and
if
the
darkness
of
mist
and
fog
and
cloud
gave
way
to
clear
twilight
and
the
of
approaching
day
before
they
reached
the
kloof
he
would
have
to
fight
in
the
open
with
stampede
at
his
side
he
would
have
welcomed
such
an
opportunity
of
matching
rifles
with
their
enemies
for
there
were
many
vantage
points
in
the
open
tundra
from
which
they
might
have
defied
assault
but
the
nearness
of
the
girl
frightened
him
she
after
all
was
the
hunted
thing
he
was
only
an
incident
from
him
could
be
exacted
nothing
more
than
the
price
of
death
he
would
be
made
to
pay
that
as
sokwenna
had
paid
for
her
remained
the
unspeakable
horror
of
graham
lust
and
passion
but
if
they
could
reach
the
kloof
and
the
in
the
face
of
the
cliff
they
could
laugh
at
graham
pack
of
beasts
while
they
waited
for
the
swift
vengeance
that
would
come
with
stampede
and
the
herdsmen
he
watched
the
sky
it
was
clearing
steadily
even
the
mists
in
the
hollows
were
beginning
to
melt
away
and
in
place
of
their
dissolution
came
faintly
lights
it
was
the
hour
of
dawn
the
sun
sent
a
golden
glow
over
the
disintegrating
curtain
of
gloom
that
still
lay
between
it
and
the
tundras
and
objects
a
hundred
paces
away
no
longer
held
shadow
or
illusionment
the
girl
did
not
pause
but
continued
to
run
lightly
and
with
surprising
speed
heeding
only
the
direction
which
he
gave
her
her
endurance
amazed
him
and
he
knew
that
without
questioning
him
she
had
guessed
the
truth
of
what
lay
behind
them
then
all
at
once
she
stopped
swayed
like
a
reed
and
would
have
fallen
if
his
arms
had
not
caught
her
splendid
he
cried
she
lay
gasping
for
breath
her
face
against
his
breast
her
heart
was
a
swiftly
beating
little
dynamo
they
had
gained
the
edge
of
a
shallow
ravine
that
reached
within
half
a
mile
of
the
kloof
it
was
this
shelter
he
had
hoped
for
and
splendid
courage
had
won
it
for
them
he
picked
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
again
as
he
had
carried
her
through
the
bottom
every
minute
every
foot
of
progress
counted
now
range
of
vision
was
widening
pools
of
sunlight
were
flecking
the
plains
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
moving
objects
would
be
distinctly
visible
a
mile
away
with
his
precious
burden
in
his
arms
her
lips
so
near
that
he
could
feel
their
breath
her
heart
throbbing
he
became
suddenly
conscious
of
the
incongruity
of
the
that
was
wakening
all
about
them
it
seemed
inconceivable
that
this
day
glorious
in
its
freshness
and
welcomed
by
the
glad
voice
of
all
living
things
should
be
a
day
of
tragedy
of
horror
and
of
impending
doom
for
him
he
wanted
to
shout
out
his
protest
and
say
that
it
was
all
a
lie
and
it
seemed
absurd
that
he
should
handicap
himself
with
the
weight
and
inconvenient
bulk
of
his
rifle
when
his
arms
wanted
to
hold
only
that
softer
treasure
which
they
bore
in
a
little
while
mary
was
traveling
at
his
side
again
and
from
then
on
he
climbed
at
intervals
to
the
higher
swellings
of
the
gully
edge
and
scanned
the
tundra
twice
he
saw
men
and
from
their
movements
he
concluded
their
enemies
believed
they
were
hidden
somewhere
on
the
tundra
not
far
from
the
of
an
hour
later
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
shallow
ravine
and
half
a
mile
of
level
plain
lay
between
them
and
the
kloof
for
a
space
they
rested
and
in
this
interval
mary
smoothed
her
long
hair
and
plaited
it
in
two
braids
in
these
moments
alan
encouraged
her
but
he
did
not
lie
he
told
her
the
of
tundra
was
their
greatest
hazard
and
described
the
risks
they
would
run
carefully
he
explained
what
she
was
to
do
under
certain
circumstances
there
was
scarcely
a
chance
they
could
cross
it
unobserved
but
they
might
be
so
far
ahead
of
the
searchers
that
they
could
beat
them
out
to
the
kloof
if
enemies
appeared
between
them
and
the
kloof
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
a
dip
or
shelter
of
rock
and
fight
and
if
pursuers
from
behind
succeeded
in
them
in
the
race
she
was
to
continue
in
the
direction
of
the
kloof
as
fast
as
she
could
go
while
he
followed
more
slowly
holding
graham
men
back
with
his
rifle
until
she
reached
the
edge
of
the
gorge
after
that
he
would
come
to
her
as
swiftly
as
he
could
run
they
started
within
five
minutes
they
were
on
the
floor
of
the
tundra
about
them
in
all
directions
stretched
the
sunlit
plains
half
a
mile
back
toward
the
range
were
moving
figures
farther
west
were
others
and
eastward
almost
at
the
edge
of
the
ravine
were
two
men
who
would
have
discovered
them
in
another
moment
if
they
had
not
descended
into
the
hollow
alan
could
see
them
kneeling
to
drink
at
the
little
coulée
which
ran
through
it
do
hurry
he
said
with
a
sudden
swift
thought
keep
parallel
with
me
and
a
distance
away
they
may
not
discover
you
are
a
woman
and
possibly
may
think
we
are
searchers
like
themselves
stop
when
i
stop
follow
my
movements
yes
sir
now
in
the
sunlight
she
was
not
afraid
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
eyes
bright
as
stars
as
she
nodded
at
him
her
face
and
hands
were
soiled
with
her
dress
spotted
and
torn
and
looking
at
her
thus
alan
laughed
and
cried
out
softly
you
beautiful
little
vagabond
she
sent
the
laugh
back
a
soft
sweet
laugh
to
give
him
courage
and
after
that
she
watched
him
closely
falling
in
with
his
scheme
so
cleverly
that
her
action
was
better
than
his
own
and
so
they
had
made
their
way
over
a
third
of
the
plain
when
alan
came
toward
her
suddenly
and
cried
now
a
glance
showed
her
what
was
happening
the
two
men
had
come
out
of
the
ravine
and
were
running
toward
them
swift
as
a
bird
she
was
ahead
of
alan
making
for
a
pinnacle
of
rock
which
he
had
pointed
out
to
her
at
the
edge
of
the
kloof
close
behind
her
he
said
do
hesitate
a
second
keep
on
going
when
they
are
a
little
nearer
i
am
going
to
kill
them
but
you
must
stop
at
intervals
he
looked
behind
him
the
two
men
were
gaining
rapidly
he
measured
the
time
when
less
than
two
hundred
yards
would
separate
them
then
he
drew
close
to
mary
side
see
that
level
place
ahead
we
cross
it
in
another
minute
or
two
when
they
come
to
it
i
going
to
stop
and
catch
them
where
they
find
shelter
but
you
must
keep
on
going
i
overtake
you
by
the
time
you
reach
the
edge
of
the
kloof
she
made
no
answer
but
ran
faster
and
when
they
had
passed
the
level
space
she
heard
his
footsteps
growing
fainter
and
her
heart
was
ready
to
choke
her
when
she
knew
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
turn
upon
their
enemies
but
in
her
mind
burned
the
low
words
of
his
command
his
warning
and
she
did
not
look
back
but
kept
her
eyes
on
the
pinnacle
of
rock
which
was
now
very
near
she
had
almost
reached
it
when
the
first
shot
came
from
behind
her
without
making
a
sound
that
would
alarm
her
alan
had
stumbled
and
made
pretense
of
falling
he
lay
upon
his
face
for
a
moment
as
if
stunned
and
then
rose
to
his
knees
an
instant
too
late
graham
men
saw
his
ruse
when
his
leveled
rifle
gleamed
in
the
sunshine
the
speed
of
their
pursuit
was
their
undoing
trying
to
catch
themselves
so
that
they
might
use
their
rifles
or
fling
themselves
upon
the
ground
they
brought
themselves
into
a
brief
but
deadly
interval
of
inaction
and
in
that
flash
one
of
the
men
went
down
under
alan
first
shot
before
he
could
fire
again
the
second
had
flattened
himself
upon
the
earth
and
swift
as
a
fox
alan
was
on
his
feet
and
racing
for
the
kloof
mary
stood
with
her
back
against
the
huge
rock
gasping
for
breath
when
he
joined
her
a
bullet
sang
over
their
heads
with
its
angry
menace
he
did
not
return
the
fire
but
drew
the
girl
quickly
behind
the
rock
he
wo
dare
to
stand
up
until
the
others
join
him
he
encouraged
her
we
beating
them
to
it
little
girl
if
you
can
keep
up
a
few
minutes
longer
she
smiled
at
him
even
as
she
struggled
to
regain
her
breath
it
seemed
to
her
there
was
no
way
of
descending
into
the
chaos
of
rock
between
the
gloomy
walls
of
the
kloof
and
she
gave
a
little
cry
when
alan
caught
her
by
her
hands
and
lowered
her
over
the
face
of
a
ledge
to
a
escarpment
below
he
laughed
at
her
fear
when
he
dropped
down
beside
her
and
held
her
close
as
they
crept
back
under
the
shelving
face
of
the
cliff
to
a
hidden
path
that
led
downward
with
a
yawning
chasm
at
their
side
the
trail
widened
as
they
descended
and
at
the
last
they
reached
the
bottom
with
the
gloom
and
shelter
of
a
crevasse
hovering
over
them
grim
and
monstrous
rocks
black
and
slippery
with
age
lay
about
them
and
among
these
they
picked
their
way
while
the
trickle
and
drip
of
water
and
the
clamminess
of
the
air
sent
a
strange
shiver
of
awe
through
mary
standish
there
was
no
life
here
only
an
whisper
that
seemed
a
part
of
death
and
when
voices
came
from
above
where
graham
men
were
gathering
they
were
ghostly
and
far
away
but
here
too
was
refuge
and
safety
mary
could
feel
it
as
they
picked
their
way
through
the
chill
and
gloom
that
lay
in
the
silent
passages
between
the
gargantuan
rocks
when
her
hands
touched
their
naked
sides
an
uncontrollable
impulse
made
her
shrink
closer
to
alan
even
though
she
sensed
the
protection
of
their
presence
they
were
like
colossi
carved
by
hands
long
dead
and
now
guarded
by
spirits
whose
voices
guttered
low
and
secretly
in
the
mysterious
drip
and
trickle
of
unseen
water
this
was
the
haunted
place
in
this
chasm
death
and
vengeance
had
glutted
themselves
long
before
she
was
born
and
when
a
rock
crashed
behind
them
accidentally
sent
down
by
one
of
the
men
above
a
cry
broke
from
her
lips
she
was
frightened
and
in
a
way
she
had
never
known
before
it
was
not
death
she
feared
here
nor
the
horror
from
which
she
had
escaped
above
but
something
unknown
and
indescribable
for
which
she
would
never
be
able
to
give
a
reason
she
clung
to
alan
and
when
at
last
the
narrow
fissure
widened
over
their
heads
and
light
came
down
and
softened
their
way
he
saw
that
her
face
was
deathly
white
we
are
almost
there
he
comforted
and
some
day
you
will
love
this
gloomy
kloof
as
i
love
it
and
we
will
travel
it
together
all
the
way
to
the
mountains
a
few
minutes
later
they
came
to
an
avalanche
of
broken
sandstone
that
was
heaped
up
the
face
of
the
precipitous
wall
and
up
this
climbed
until
they
came
to
a
level
shelf
of
rock
and
back
of
this
was
a
great
depression
in
the
rock
forty
feet
deep
and
half
as
wide
with
a
floor
as
level
as
a
table
and
covered
with
soft
white
sand
mary
would
never
forget
her
first
glimpse
of
this
place
it
was
unreal
strange
as
if
a
band
of
outlaw
fairies
had
brought
the
white
sand
for
a
carpet
and
had
made
this
their
where
wind
and
rain
and
snow
could
never
blow
and
up
the
face
of
the
cavern
as
if
to
make
her
thought
more
real
led
a
ragged
fissure
which
it
seemed
to
her
only
feet
could
travel
and
which
ended
at
the
level
of
the
plain
so
they
were
tundra
fairies
coming
down
from
flowers
and
sunlight
through
that
fissure
and
it
was
from
the
evil
spirits
in
the
kloof
itself
that
they
must
have
hidden
themselves
something
in
the
humor
and
gentle
thought
of
it
all
made
her
smile
at
alan
but
his
face
had
turned
suddenly
grim
and
she
looked
up
the
kloof
where
they
had
traveled
through
danger
and
come
to
safety
and
then
she
saw
that
which
froze
all
thought
of
fairies
out
of
her
heart
men
were
coming
through
the
chaos
and
upheaval
of
rock
there
were
many
of
them
appearing
out
of
the
darker
neck
of
the
gorge
into
the
clearer
light
and
at
their
head
was
a
man
upon
whom
mary
eyes
fixed
themselves
in
horror
she
looked
at
alan
he
had
guessed
the
truth
that
man
in
front
he
asked
she
nodded
yes
is
john
graham
he
heard
the
words
choking
in
her
throat
yes
john
graham
he
swung
his
rifle
slowly
his
eyes
burning
with
a
steely
fire
i
think
he
said
that
from
here
i
can
easily
kill
him
her
hand
touched
his
arm
she
was
looking
into
his
eyes
fear
had
gone
out
of
them
and
in
its
place
was
a
soft
and
gentle
radiance
a
prayer
to
him
i
am
thinking
of
tomorrow
the
next
day
the
years
and
years
to
come
she
whispered
alan
you
ca
kill
john
graham
not
until
god
shows
us
it
is
the
only
thing
left
for
us
to
do
you
ca
the
crash
of
a
rifle
between
the
rock
walls
interrupted
her
the
snarl
of
a
bullet
followed
the
shot
she
heard
it
strike
and
her
heart
stopped
beating
and
the
rigidity
of
death
came
into
her
limbs
and
body
as
she
saw
the
swift
and
terrible
change
in
the
stricken
face
of
the
man
she
loved
he
tried
to
smile
at
her
even
as
a
red
blot
came
where
the
streak
of
gray
in
his
hair
touched
his
forehead
and
then
he
crumpled
down
at
her
feet
and
his
rifle
rattled
against
the
rocks
she
knew
it
was
death
something
seemed
to
burst
in
her
head
and
fill
her
brain
with
the
roar
of
a
flood
she
screamed
even
the
men
below
hesitated
and
their
hearts
jumped
with
a
new
sensation
as
the
terrible
cry
of
a
woman
rang
between
the
rock
walls
of
the
chasm
and
following
the
cry
a
voice
came
down
to
them
john
graham
i
going
to
kill
you
and
snatching
up
the
fallen
rifle
mary
standish
set
herself
to
the
task
of
vengeance
chapter
xxvii
she
waited
the
ferocity
of
a
mother
defending
her
young
filled
her
soul
and
she
moaned
in
her
grief
and
despair
as
the
seconds
passed
but
she
did
not
fire
blindly
for
she
knew
she
must
kill
john
graham
the
troublesome
thing
was
a
strange
film
that
persisted
in
gathering
before
her
eyes
something
she
tried
to
brush
away
but
which
obstinately
refused
to
go
she
did
not
know
she
was
sobbing
as
she
looked
over
the
rifle
barrel
the
figures
came
swiftly
but
she
had
lost
sight
of
john
graham
they
reached
the
upheaval
of
shattered
rock
and
began
climbing
it
and
in
her
desire
to
make
out
the
man
she
hated
she
stood
above
the
rampart
that
had
sheltered
her
the
men
looked
alike
jumping
and
dodging
like
so
many
big
tundra
hares
as
they
came
nearer
and
suddenly
it
occurred
to
her
that
of
them
were
john
grahams
and
that
she
must
kill
swiftly
and
accurately
only
the
hiding
fairies
might
have
guessed
how
her
reason
trembled
and
almost
fell
in
those
moments
when
she
began
firing
certainly
john
graham
and
his
men
did
not
for
her
first
shot
was
a
lucky
one
and
a
man
slipped
down
among
the
rocks
at
the
crack
of
it
after
that
she
continued
to
fire
until
the
responseless
click
of
the
hammer
told
her
the
gun
was
empty
the
explosions
and
the
shock
against
her
slight
shoulder
cleared
her
vision
and
her
brain
she
saw
the
men
still
coming
and
they
were
so
near
she
could
see
their
faces
clearly
and
again
her
soul
cried
out
in
its
desire
to
kill
john
graham
she
turned
and
for
an
instant
fell
upon
her
knees
beside
alan
his
face
was
hidden
in
his
arm
swiftly
she
tore
his
automatic
from
its
holster
and
sprang
back
to
her
rock
there
was
no
time
to
wait
or
choose
now
for
his
murderers
were
almost
upon
her
with
all
her
strength
she
tried
to
fire
accurately
but
alan
big
gun
leaped
and
twisted
in
her
hand
as
she
poured
its
fire
wildly
down
among
the
rocks
until
it
was
empty
her
own
smaller
weapon
she
had
lost
somewhere
in
the
race
to
the
kloof
and
now
when
she
found
she
had
fired
her
last
shot
she
waited
through
another
instant
of
horror
until
she
was
striking
at
faces
that
came
within
the
reach
of
her
arm
and
then
like
a
monster
created
suddenly
by
an
evil
spirit
graham
was
at
her
side
she
had
a
moment
vision
of
his
cruel
exultant
face
his
eyes
blazing
with
a
passion
that
was
almost
madness
his
powerful
body
lunging
upon
her
then
his
arms
came
about
her
she
could
feel
herself
crushing
inside
them
and
fought
against
their
cruel
pressure
then
broke
limply
and
hung
a
resistless
weight
against
him
she
was
not
unconscious
but
her
strength
was
gone
and
if
the
arms
had
closed
a
little
more
they
would
have
killed
her
and
she
could
hear
clearly
she
heard
suddenly
the
shots
that
came
from
up
the
kloof
scattered
shots
then
many
of
them
and
after
that
the
strange
wild
cries
that
only
the
eskimo
herdsmen
make
graham
arms
relaxed
his
eyes
swept
the
fairies
with
its
white
sand
floor
and
fierce
joy
lit
up
his
face
martens
it
could
happen
in
a
better
place
he
said
to
a
man
who
stood
near
him
leave
me
five
men
take
the
others
and
help
schneider
if
you
do
clean
them
out
retreat
this
way
and
six
rifles
from
this
ambuscade
will
do
the
business
in
a
hurry
mary
heard
the
names
of
the
men
called
who
were
to
stay
the
others
hurried
away
the
firing
in
the
kloof
was
steady
now
but
there
were
no
cries
no
shouts
nothing
but
the
ominous
crack
of
the
rifles
graham
arms
closed
about
her
again
then
he
picked
her
up
and
carried
her
back
into
the
cavern
and
in
a
place
where
the
rock
wall
sagged
inward
making
a
pocket
of
gloom
which
was
shut
out
from
the
light
of
day
he
laid
her
upon
the
carpet
of
sand
where
the
erosion
of
many
centuries
of
dripping
water
had
eaten
its
first
step
in
the
making
of
the
ragged
fissure
a
fairy
had
begun
to
climb
down
from
the
edge
of
the
tundra
he
was
a
swift
and
agile
fairy
very
red
in
the
face
breathing
fast
from
hard
running
but
making
not
a
sound
as
he
came
like
a
gopher
where
it
seemed
no
living
thing
could
find
a
hold
and
the
fairy
was
stampede
smith
from
the
lips
of
the
kloof
he
had
seen
the
last
few
seconds
of
the
tragedy
below
and
where
death
would
have
claimed
him
in
a
more
reasonable
moment
he
came
down
in
safety
now
in
his
was
the
old
tingling
of
years
ago
and
in
his
blood
the
thrill
which
he
had
thought
was
long
dead
the
thrill
of
looking
over
leveled
guns
into
the
eyes
of
other
men
time
had
rolled
back
and
he
was
the
old
stampede
smith
he
saw
under
him
lust
and
passion
and
murder
as
in
other
days
he
had
seen
them
and
between
him
and
desire
there
was
neither
law
nor
conscience
to
bar
the
way
and
his
dream
a
last
great
fight
was
here
to
fill
the
final
unwritten
page
of
a
life
drama
that
was
almost
closed
and
what
a
fight
if
he
could
make
that
carpet
of
soft
white
sand
unheard
and
unseen
six
to
one
six
men
with
guns
at
their
sides
and
rifles
in
their
hands
what
a
glorious
end
it
would
be
for
a
woman
and
alan
holt
he
blessed
the
firing
up
the
kloof
which
kept
the
men
faces
turned
that
way
he
thanked
god
for
the
sound
of
combat
which
made
the
scraping
of
rock
and
the
rattle
of
stones
under
his
feet
unheard
he
was
almost
down
when
a
larger
rock
broke
loose
and
fell
to
the
ledge
two
of
the
men
turned
but
in
that
same
instant
came
a
more
thrilling
interruption
a
cry
a
shrill
scream
a
woman
voice
filled
with
madness
and
despair
came
from
the
depth
of
the
cavern
and
the
five
men
stared
in
the
direction
of
its
agony
close
upon
the
cries
came
mary
standish
with
graham
behind
her
reaching
out
his
hands
for
her
the
girl
hair
was
flying
her
face
the
color
of
the
white
sand
and
graham
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
demon
forgetful
of
all
else
but
her
he
caught
her
the
slim
body
crumpled
in
his
arms
again
while
pitifully
weak
hands
beat
futilely
in
his
face
and
then
came
a
cry
such
as
no
man
had
ever
heard
in
ghost
kloof
before
it
was
stampede
smith
a
sheer
twenty
feet
he
had
leaped
to
the
carpet
of
sand
and
as
he
jumped
his
hands
whipped
out
his
two
guns
and
scarcely
had
his
feet
touched
the
floor
of
the
soft
pocket
in
the
ledge
when
death
crashed
from
them
swift
as
lightning
flashes
and
three
of
the
five
were
tottering
or
falling
before
the
other
two
could
draw
or
swing
a
rifle
only
one
of
them
had
fired
a
shot
the
other
went
down
as
if
his
legs
had
been
knocked
from
under
him
by
a
club
and
the
one
who
fired
bent
forward
then
as
if
making
a
bow
to
death
and
pitched
on
his
face
and
then
stampede
smith
whirled
upon
john
graham
during
these
few
swift
seconds
graham
had
stood
stunned
with
the
girl
crushed
against
his
breast
he
was
behind
her
sheltered
by
her
body
her
head
protecting
his
heart
and
as
stampede
turned
he
was
drawing
a
gun
his
dark
face
blazing
with
the
fiendish
knowledge
that
the
other
could
not
shoot
without
killing
the
girl
the
horror
of
the
situation
gripped
stampede
he
saw
graham
pistol
rise
slowly
and
deliberately
he
watched
it
fascinated
and
the
look
in
graham
face
was
the
cold
and
unexcited
triumph
of
a
devil
stampede
saw
only
that
face
it
was
four
inches
perhaps
five
away
from
the
girl
there
was
only
that
and
the
extending
arm
the
crooking
finger
the
black
mouth
of
the
automatic
seeking
his
heart
and
then
in
that
last
second
straight
into
the
girl
staring
eyes
blazed
stampede
gun
and
the
four
inches
of
leering
face
behind
her
was
suddenly
blotted
out
it
was
stampede
and
not
the
girl
who
closed
his
eyes
then
and
when
he
opened
them
and
saw
mary
standish
sobbing
over
alan
body
and
graham
lying
face
down
in
the
sand
he
reverently
raised
the
gun
from
which
he
had
fired
the
last
shot
and
pressed
its
hot
barrel
to
his
thin
lips
then
he
went
to
alan
he
raised
the
limp
head
while
mary
bowed
her
face
in
her
hands
in
her
anguish
she
prayed
that
she
too
might
die
for
in
this
hour
of
triumph
over
graham
there
was
no
hope
or
joy
for
her
alan
was
gone
only
death
could
have
come
with
that
terrible
red
blot
on
his
forehead
just
under
the
gray
streak
in
his
hair
and
without
him
there
was
no
longer
a
reason
for
her
to
live
she
reached
out
her
arms
give
him
to
me
she
whispered
give
him
to
me
through
the
agony
that
burned
in
her
eyes
she
did
not
see
the
look
in
stampede
face
but
she
heard
his
voice
it
was
a
bullet
that
hit
him
stampede
was
saying
the
bullet
hit
a
rock
an
it
was
a
chip
from
the
rock
that
caught
him
square
between
the
eyes
he
is
dead
he
ai
going
to
die
how
many
weeks
or
months
or
years
it
was
after
his
last
memory
of
the
fairies
before
he
came
back
to
life
alan
could
make
no
manner
of
guess
but
he
did
know
that
for
a
long
long
time
he
was
riding
through
space
on
a
soft
white
cloud
vainly
trying
to
overtake
a
girl
with
streaming
hair
who
fled
on
another
cloud
ahead
of
him
and
at
last
this
cloud
broke
up
like
a
great
cake
of
ice
and
the
girl
plunged
into
the
immeasurable
depths
over
which
they
were
sailing
and
he
leaped
after
her
then
came
strange
lights
and
darkness
and
sounds
like
the
clashing
of
cymbals
and
voices
and
after
those
things
a
long
sleep
from
which
he
opened
his
eyes
to
find
himself
in
a
bed
and
a
face
very
near
with
shining
eyes
that
looked
at
him
through
a
sea
of
tears
and
a
voice
whispered
to
him
sweetly
softly
joyously
alan
he
tried
to
reach
up
his
arms
the
face
came
nearer
it
was
pressed
against
his
own
soft
arms
crept
about
him
softer
lips
kissed
his
mouth
and
eyes
and
sobbing
whispers
came
with
their
love
and
he
knew
the
end
of
the
race
had
come
and
he
had
won
this
was
the
fifth
day
after
the
fight
in
the
kloof
and
on
the
sixth
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
bolstered
with
pillows
and
stampede
came
to
see
him
and
then
keok
and
nawadlook
and
tatpan
and
topkok
and
wegaruk
his
old
housekeeper
and
only
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
was
mary
away
from
him
but
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
did
not
come
and
he
saw
the
strange
change
in
keok
and
knew
that
they
were
dead
yet
he
dreaded
to
ask
the
question
for
more
than
any
others
of
his
people
did
he
love
these
two
missing
comrades
of
the
tundras
it
was
stampede
who
first
told
him
in
detail
what
had
happened
but
he
would
say
little
of
the
fight
on
the
ledge
and
it
was
mary
who
told
him
of
that
graham
had
over
thirty
men
with
him
and
only
ten
got
away
he
said
we
have
buried
sixteen
and
are
caring
for
seven
wounded
at
the
corrals
now
that
graham
is
dead
they
frightened
stiff
afraid
we
going
to
hand
them
over
to
the
law
and
without
graham
or
rossland
to
fight
for
them
they
know
they
lost
and
our
men
my
people
asked
alan
faintly
fought
like
devils
yes
i
know
but
they
did
rest
an
hour
in
coming
from
the
mountains
you
know
what
i
mean
stampede
not
many
alan
seven
were
killed
including
sokwenna
and
he
counted
over
the
names
of
the
slain
tautuk
and
amuk
toolik
were
not
among
them
and
tautuk
he
is
wounded
missed
death
by
an
inch
and
it
has
almost
killed
keok
she
is
with
him
night
and
day
and
as
jealous
as
a
little
cat
if
anyone
else
attempts
to
do
anything
for
him
then
i
am
glad
tautuk
was
hit
smiled
alan
and
he
asked
where
is
amuk
toolik
stampede
hung
his
head
and
blushed
like
a
boy
you
have
to
ask
alan
and
a
little
later
alan
put
the
question
to
mary
she
too
blushed
and
in
her
eyes
was
a
mysterious
radiance
that
puzzled
him
you
must
wait
she
said
beyond
that
she
would
say
no
word
though
he
pulled
her
head
down
and
with
his
hands
in
her
soft
smooth
hair
threatened
to
hold
her
until
she
told
him
the
secret
her
answer
was
a
satisfied
little
sigh
and
she
nestled
her
pink
face
against
his
neck
and
whispered
that
she
was
content
to
accept
the
punishment
so
where
amuk
toolik
had
gone
and
what
he
was
doing
still
remained
a
mystery
a
little
later
he
knew
he
had
guessed
the
truth
i
do
need
a
doctor
he
said
but
it
was
mighty
thoughtful
of
you
to
send
amuk
toolik
for
one
then
he
caught
himself
suddenly
what
a
senseless
fool
i
am
of
course
there
are
others
who
need
a
doctor
more
than
i
do
mary
nodded
but
i
was
thinking
chiefly
of
you
when
i
sent
amuk
toolik
to
tanana
he
is
riding
kauk
and
should
return
almost
any
time
now
and
she
turned
her
face
away
so
that
he
could
see
only
the
pink
tip
of
her
ear
very
soon
i
will
be
on
my
feet
and
ready
for
travel
he
said
then
we
will
start
for
the
states
as
we
planned
you
will
have
to
go
alone
alan
for
i
shall
be
too
busy
fitting
up
the
new
house
she
replied
in
such
a
quiet
composed
little
voice
that
he
was
stunned
i
have
already
given
orders
for
the
cutting
of
timber
in
the
foothills
and
stampede
and
amuk
toolik
will
begin
construction
very
soon
i
am
sorry
you
find
your
business
in
the
states
so
important
alan
it
will
be
a
little
lonesome
with
you
away
he
gasped
mary
she
did
not
turn
he
could
see
again
that
little
throb
in
her
throat
when
she
faced
him
and
then
he
learned
the
secret
softly
whispered
with
sweet
warm
lips
pressed
to
his
it
was
a
doctor
i
sent
for
alan
it
was
a
minister
we
need
one
to
marry
stampede
and
nawadlook
and
tautuk
and
keok
of
course
you
and
i
can
wait
but
she
never
finished
for
her
lips
were
smothered
with
a
love
that
brought
a
little
sob
of
joy
from
her
heart
and
then
she
whispered
things
to
him
which
he
had
never
guessed
of
mary
standish
and
never
quite
hoped
to
hear
she
was
a
little
wild
a
little
reckless
it
may
be
but
what
she
said
filled
him
with
a
happiness
which
he
believed
had
never
come
to
any
other
man
in
the
world
it
was
not
her
desire
to
return
to
the
states
at
all
she
never
wanted
to
return
she
wanted
nothing
down
there
nothing
that
the
standish
had
left
her
unless
he
could
find
some
way
of
using
it
for
the
good
of
alaska
and
even
then
she
was
afraid
it
might
lead
to
the
breaking
of
her
dream
for
there
was
only
one
thing
that
would
make
her
happy
and
that
was
world
she
wanted
it
just
as
it
was
the
big
tundras
his
people
the
herds
the
mountains
with
the
glory
and
greatness
of
god
all
about
them
in
the
open
spaces
she
now
understood
what
he
had
meant
when
he
said
he
was
an
alaskan
and
not
an
american
she
was
that
too
an
alaskan
first
of
all
and
for
alaska
she
would
go
on
fighting
with
him
hand
in
hand
until
the
very
end
his
heart
throbbed
until
it
seemed
it
would
break
and
all
the
time
she
was
whispering
her
hopes
and
secrets
to
him
he
stroked
her
silken
hair
until
it
lay
spread
over
his
breast
and
against
his
lips
and
for
the
first
time
in
years
a
hot
flood
of
tears
filled
his
eyes
so
happiness
came
to
them
and
only
strange
voices
outside
raised
head
from
where
it
lay
and
took
her
quickly
to
the
window
where
she
stood
a
vision
of
sweet
loveliness
radiant
in
the
tumbled
confusion
and
glory
of
her
hair
then
she
turned
with
a
little
cry
and
her
eyes
were
shining
like
stars
as
she
looked
at
alan
it
is
amuk
toolik
she
said
he
has
returned
and
is
he
alone
alan
asked
and
his
heart
stood
still
while
he
waited
for
her
answer
demurely
she
came
to
his
side
and
smoothed
his
pillow
and
stroked
back
his
hair
i
must
go
and
do
up
my
hair
alan
she
said
then
it
would
never
do
for
them
to
find
me
like
this
and
suddenly
in
a
moment
their
fingers
entwined
and
tightened
for
on
the
roof
of
sokwenna
cabin
the
little
thrush
was
singing
again
