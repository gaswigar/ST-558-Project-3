step
by

flowers

for
death
i
will
swing
you
in

swing
among

branches

your
skirt
through
the
leaves
i
will
replenish
with
scented
oil
the
lamp

by

slip
flower
chains
over
your
wrists
to
tinge
the
soles
of
your
feet
with
the
red
juice
of
petals

speck
of
dust

prayers

servant

gardener

flower
garden
ah
poet
the
evening
draws
near
your
hair
is
turning
grey
do
you
in
your
lonely
musing
hear
the
message
of
the
hereafter
it
is
evening
the
poet
said
and
i
am
listening
because
some
one
may
call
from
the
village
late
though
it
be
i
watch
if
young
straying
hearts
meet
together
and
two
pairs
of
eager
eyes
beg
for
music
to
break
their
silence
and
speak
for
them
who
is
there
to
weave
their
passionate
songs
if
i
sit
on
the
shore
of
life
and
contemplate
death
and
the
beyond
the
early
evening
star
disappears
the
glow
of
a
funeral
pyre
slowly
dies
by
the
silent
river
jackals
cry
in
chorus
from
the
courtyard
of
the
deserted
house
in
the
light
of
the
moon
if
some
wanderer
leaving
home
come
here
to
watch
the
night
and
with
bowed
head
listen
to
the
murmur
of
the
darkness
who
is
there
to
whisper
the
secrets
of
life
into
his
ears
if
i
shutting
my
doors
should
try
to
free
myself
from
mortal
bonds
it
is
a
trifle
that
my
hair
is
turning
grey
i
am
ever
as
young
or
as
old
as
the
youngest
and
the
oldest
of
this
village
some
have
smiles
sweet
and
simple
and
some
a
sly
twinkle
in
their
eyes
some
have
tears
that
well
up
in
the
daylight
and
others
tears
that
are
hidden
in
the
gloom
they
all
have
need
for
me
and
i
have
no
time
to
brood
over
the
afterlife
i
am
of
an
age
with
each
what
matter
if
my
hair
turns
grey
in
the
morning
i
cast
my
net
into
the
sea
i
dragged
up
from
the
dark
abyss
things
of
strange
aspect
and
strange
beauty
some
shone
like
a
smile
some
glistened
like
tears
and
some
were
flushed
like
the
cheeks
of
a
bride
when
with
the
day
burden
i
went
home
my
love
was
sitting
in
the
garden
idly
tearing
the
leaves
of
a
flower
i
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
placed
at
her
feet
all
that
i
had
dragged
up
and
stood
silent
she
glanced
at
them
and
said
what
strange
things
are
these
i
know
not
of
what
use
they
are
i
bowed
my
head
in
shame
and
thought
i
have
not
fought
for
these
i
did
not
buy
them
in
the
market
they
are
not
fit
gifts
for
her
then
the
whole
night
through
i
flung
them
one
by
one
into
the
street
in
the
morning
travellers
came
they
picked
them
up
and
carried
them
into
far
countries
ah
me
why
did
they
build
my
house
by
the
road
to
the
market
town
they
moor
their
laden
boats
near
my
trees
they
come
and
go
and
wander
at
their
will
i
sit
and
watch
them
my
time
wears
on
turn
them
away
i
can
not
and
thus
my
days
pass
by
night
and
day
their
steps
sound
by
my
door
vainly
i
cry
i
do
not
know
you
some
of
them
are
known
to
my
fingers
some
to
my
nostrils
the
blood
in
my
veins
seems
to
know
them
and
some
are
known
to
my
dreams
turn
them
away
i
can
not
i
call
them
and
say
come
to
my
house
whoever
chooses
yes
come
in
the
morning
the
bell
rings
in
the
temple
they
come
with
their
baskets
in
their
hands
their
feet
are
rosy
red
the
early
light
of
dawn
is
on
their
faces
turn
them
away
i
can
not
i
call
them
and
i
say
come
to
my
garden
to
gather
flowers
come
hither
in
the
the
gong
sounds
at
the
palace
gate
i
know
not
why
they
leave
their
work
and
linger
near
my
hedge
the
flowers
in
their
hair
are
pale
and
faded
the
notes
are
languid
in
their
flutes
turn
them
away
i
can
not
i
call
them
and
say
the
shade
is
cool
under
my
trees
come
friends
at
night
the
crickets
chirp
in
the
woods
who
is
it
that
comes
slowly
to
my
door
and
gently
knocks
i
vaguely
see
the
face
not
a
word
is
spoken
the
stillness
of
the
sky
is
all
around
turn
away
my
silent
guest
i
can
not
i
look
at
the
face
through
the
dark
and
hours
of
dreams
pass
by
i
am
restless
i
am
athirst
for
things
my
soul
goes
out
in
a
longing
to
touch
the
skirt
of
the
dim
distance
o
great
beyond
o
the
keen
call
of
thy
flute
i
forget
i
ever
forget
that
i
have
no
wings
to
fly
that
i
am
bound
in
this
spot
evermore
i
am
eager
and
wakeful
i
am
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
thy
breath
comes
to
me
whispering
an
impossible
hope
thy
tongue
is
known
to
my
heart
as
its
very
own
o
o
the
keen
call
of
thy
flute
i
forget
i
ever
forget
that
i
know
not
the
way
that
i
have
not
the
winged
horse
i
am
listless
i
am
a
wanderer
in
my
heart
in
the
sunny
haze
of
the
languid
hours
what
vast
vision
of
thine
takes
shape
in
the
blue
of
the
sky
o
farthest
end
o
the
keen
call
of
thy
flute
i
forget
i
ever
forget
that
the
gates
are
shut
everywhere
in
the
house
where
i
dwell
alone
the
tame
bird
was
in
a
cage
the
free
bird
was
in
the
forest
they
met
when
the
time
came
it
was
a
decree
of
fate
the
free
bird
cries
o
my
love
let
us
fly
to
wood
the
cage
bird
whispers
come
hither
let
us
both
live
in
the
cage
says
the
free
bird
among
bars
where
is
there
room
to
spread
one
wings
alas
cries
the
cage
bird
i
should
not
know
where
to
sit
perched
in
the
sky
the
free
bird
cries
my
darling
sing
the
songs
of
the
woodlands
the
cage
bird
says
sit
by
my
side
i
teach
you
the
speech
of
the
learned
the
forest
bird
cries
no
ah
no
songs
can
never
be
taught
the
cage
bird
says
alas
for
me
i
know
not
the
songs
of
the
woodlands
their
love
is
intense
with
longing
but
they
never
can
fly
wing
to
wing
through
the
bars
of
the
cage
they
look
and
vain
is
their
wish
to
know
each
other
they
flutter
their
wings
in
yearning
and
sing
come
closer
my
love
the
free
bird
cries
it
can
not
be
i
fear
the
closed
doors
of
the
cage
the
cage
bird
whispers
alas
my
wings
are
powerless
and
dead
o
mother
the
young
prince
is
to
pass
by
our
door
how
can
i
attend
to
my
work
this
morning
show
me
how
to
braid
up
my
hair
tell
me
what
garment
to
put
on
why
do
you
look
at
me
amazed
mother
i
know
well
he
will
not
glance
up
once
at
my
window
i
know
he
will
pass
out
of
my
sight
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
only
the
vanishing
strain
of
the
flute
will
come
sobbing
to
me
from
afar
but
the
young
prince
will
pass
by
our
door
and
i
will
put
on
my
best
for
the
moment
o
mother
the
young
prince
did
pass
by
our
door
and
the
morning
sun
flashed
from
his
chariot
i
swept
aside
the
veil
from
my
face
i
tore
the
ruby
chain
from
my
neck
and
flung
it
in
his
path
why
do
you
look
at
me
amazed
mother
i
know
well
he
did
not
pick
up
my
chain
i
know
it
was
crushed
under
his
wheels
leaving
a
red
stain
upon
the
dust
and
no
one
knows
what
my
gift
was
nor
to
whom
but
the
young
prince
did
pass
by
our
door
and
i
flung
the
jewel
from
my
breast
before
his
path
when
the
lamp
went
out
by
my
bed
i
woke
up
with
the
early
birds
i
sat
at
my
open
window
with
a
fresh
wreath
on
my
loose
hair
the
young
traveller
came
along
the
road
in
the
rosy
mist
of
the
morning
a
pearl
chain
was
on
his
neck
and
the
sun
rays
fell
on
his
crown
he
stopped
before
my
door
and
asked
me
with
an
eager
cry
where
is
she
for
very
shame
i
could
not
say
she
is
i
young
traveller
she
is
i
it
was
dusk
and
the
lamp
was
not
lit
i
was
listlessly
braiding
my
hair
the
young
traveller
came
on
his
chariot
in
the
glow
of
the
setting
sun
his
horses
were
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
there
was
dust
on
his
garment
he
alighted
at
my
door
and
asked
in
a
tired
voice
where
is
she
for
very
shame
i
could
not
say
she
is
i
weary
traveller
she
is
i
it
is
an
april
night
the
lamp
is
burning
in
my
room
the
breeze
of
the
south
comes
gently
the
noisy
parrot
sleeps
in
its
cage
my
bodice
is
of
the
colour
of
the
peacock
throat
and
my
mantle
is
green
as
young
grass
i
sit
upon
the
floor
at
the
window
watching
the
deserted
street
through
the
dark
night
i
keep
humming
she
is
i
despairing
traveller
she
is
i
when
i
go
alone
at
night
to
my
birds
do
not
sing
the
wind
does
not
stir
the
houses
on
both
sides
of
the
street
stand
silent
it
is
my
own
anklets
that
grow
loud
at
every
step
and
i
am
ashamed
when
i
sit
on
my
balcony
and
listen
for
his
footsteps
leaves
do
not
rustle
on
the
trees
and
the
water
is
still
in
the
river
like
the
sword
on
the
knees
of
a
sentry
fallen
asleep
it
is
my
own
heart
that
beats
wildly
i
do
not
know
how
to
quiet
it
when
my
love
comes
and
sits
by
my
side
when
my
body
trembles
and
my
eyelids
droop
the
night
darkens
the
wind
blows
out
the
lamp
and
the
clouds
draw
veils
over
the
stars
it
is
the
jewel
at
my
own
breast
that
shines
and
gives
light
i
do
not
know
how
to
hide
it
let
your
work
be
bride

guest
has
come

is
gently
shaking
the
chain
which

door

step

of
cranes
fly
up
from
the
further
and
fitful
gusts
of
wind
rush
over
the
heath
the
anxious
cattle
run
to
their
stalls
in
the
village

you
see
the
clouds
wrapping
the
sky
in

toilet
lamp

wind

for

your
pitcher

to
my
lake
the
water
will
cling
round
your
feet
and
babble
its
secret
the
shadow
of
the
coming
rain
is
on
the
sands
and
the
clouds
hang
low
upon
the
blue
lines
of
the
trees
like
the
heavy
hair
above
your
eyebrows
i
know
well
the
rhythm
of
your
steps
they
are
beating
in
my
heart
come
o
come
to
my
lake
if
you
must
fill
your
pitcher
if

your
pitcher
float
on

water

to
my
lake
the
grassy
slope
is
green
and
the
wild
flowers
beyond
number

thoughts
will
stray
out
of
your
dark
eyes
like
birds
from
their
nests
your
veil
will
drop
to
your
feet
come
o
come
to
my
lake
if
you
must
sit
idle
if
you
would
leave
off
your
play
and
dive
in
the
water
come
o
come
to
my
lake
let
your
blue
mantle
lie
on
the
shore
the
blue
water
will
cover
you
and
hide
you
the
waves
will
stand
to
kiss
your
neck
and
whisper
in
your
ears
come
o
come
to
my
lake
if
you
would
dive
in
the
water
if
you
must
be
mad
and
leap
to
your
death
come
o
come
to
my
lake
it
is
cool
and
fathomlessly
deep
it
is
dark
like
a
sleep
that
is
dreamless
there
in
its
depths
nights
and
days
are
one
and
songs
are
silence
come
o
come
to
my
lake
if
you
would
plunge
to
your
death
i
asked
nothing
only
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
behind
the
tree
languor
was
still
upon
the
eyes
of
the
dawn
and
the
dew
in
the
air
the
lazy
smell
of
the
damp
grass
hung
in
the
thin
mist
above
the
earth
under
the
banyan
tree
you
were
milking
the
cow
with
your
hands
tender
and
fresh
as
butter
and
i
was
standing
still
i
did
not
say
a
word
it
was
the
bird
that
sang
unseen
from
the
thicket
the
mango
tree
was
shedding
its
flowers
upon
the
village
road
and
the
bees
came
humming
one
by
one
on
the
side
of
the
pond
the
gate
of
temple
was
opened
and
the
worshipper
had
begun
his
chants
with
the
vessel
on
your
lap
you
were
milking
the
cow
i
stood
with
my
empty
can
i
did
not
come
near
you
the
sky
woke
with
the
sound
of
the
gong
at
the
temple
the
dust
was
raised
in
the
road
from
the
hoofs
of
the
driven
cattle
with
the
gurgling
pitchers
at
their
hips
women
came
from
the
river
your
bracelets
were
jingling
and
foam
brimming
over
the
jar
the
morning
wore
on
and
i
did
not
come
near
you
i
was
walking
by
the
road
i
do
not
know
why
when
the
noonday
was
past
and
bamboo
branches
rustled
in
the
wind
the
prone
shadows
with
their
arms
clung
to
the
feet
of
the
hurrying
light
the
were
weary
of
their
songs
i
was
walking
by
the
road
i
do
not
know
why
the
hut
by
the
side
of
the
water
is
shaded
by
an
overhanging
tree
some
one
was
busy
with
her
work
and
her
bangles
made
music
in
the
corner
i
stood
before
this
hut
i
know
not
why
the
narrow
winding
road
crosses
many
a
mustard
field
and
many
a
mango
forest
it
passes
by
the
temple
of
the
village
and
the
market
at
the
river
landing
place
i
stopped
by
this
hut
i
do
not
know
why
years
ago
it
was
a
day
of
breezy
march
when
the
murmur
of
the
spring
was
languorous
and
mango
blossoms
were
dropping
on
the
dust
the
rippling
water
leapt
and
licked
the
brass
vessel
that
stood
on
the
landing
step
i
think
of
that
day
of
breezy
march
i
do
not
know
why
shadows
are
deepening
and
cattle
returning
to
their
folds
the
light
is
grey
upon
the
lonely
meadows
and
the
villagers
are
waiting
for
the
ferry
at
the
bank
i
slowly
return
upon
my
steps
i
do
not
know
why
i
run
as
a
runs
in
the
shadow
of
the
forest
mad
with
his
own
perfume
the
night
is
the
night
of
the
breeze
is
the
breeze
of
the
south
i
lose
my
way
and
i
wander
i
seek
what
i
can
not
get
i
get
what
i
do
not
seek
from
my
heart
comes
out
and
dances
the
image
of
my
own
desire
the
gleaming
vision
flits
on
i
try
to
clasp
it
firmly
it
eludes
me
and
leads
me
astray
i
seek
what
i
can
not
get
i
get
what
i
do
not
seek
hands
cling
to
hands
and
eyes
linger
on
eyes
thus
begins
the
record
of
our
hearts
it
is
the
moonlit
night
of
march
the
sweet
smell
of
is
in
the
air
my
flute
lies
on
the
earth
neglected
and
your
garland
of
flowers
in
unfinished
this
love
between
you
and
me
is
simple
as
a
song
your
veil
of
the
saffron
colour
makes
my
eyes
drunk
the
jasmine
wreath
that
you
wove
me
thrills
to
my
heart
like
praise
it
is
a
game
of
giving
and
withholding
revealing
and
screening
again
some
smiles
and
some
little
shyness
and
some
sweet
useless
struggles
this
love
between
you
and
me
is
simple
as
a
song
no
mystery
beyond
the
present
no
striving
for
the
impossible
no
shadow
behind
the
charm
no
groping
in
the
depth
of
the
dark
this
love
between
you
and
me
is
simple
as
a
song
we
do
not
stray
out
of
all
words
into
the
ever
silent
we
do
not
raise
our
hands
to
the
void
for
things
beyond
hope
it
is
enough
what
we
give
and
we
get
we
have
not
crushed
the
joy
to
the
utmost
to
wring
from
it
the
wine
of
pain
this
love
between
you
and
me
is
simple
as
a
song
the
yellow
bird
sings
in
their
tree
and
makes
my
heart
dance
with
gladness
we
both
live
in
the
same
village
and
that
is
our
one
piece
of
joy
her
pair
of
pet
lambs
come
to
graze
in
the
shade
of
our
garden
trees
if
they
stray
into
our
barley
field
i
take
them
up
in
my
arms

name
of
our
village

khanjan
and
anjan

call

river

name
is
known
to
all

village
and
her
name
is

only
one
field
lies
between
us
bees
that
have
hived
in
our
grove
go
to
seek
honey
in
theirs
flowers
launched
from
their
come

by
the
stream
where
we
bathe

of
dried
flowers

from
their
fields

our
market

the
lane
that

to
their
house
is
fragrant
in
the
spring
with
mango
flowers
when
their
linseed
is
ripe
for
harvest
the
hemp
is
in
bloom
in
our
field
the
stars
that

on
their
cottage

twinkling
look

rain

floods
their
tank
makes
glad

and

name
is
ranjan
when
the
two
sisters
go
to
fetch
water
they
come
to
this
spot
and
they
smile
they
must
be
aware
of
somebody
who
stands
behind
the
trees
whenever
they
go
to
fetch
water
the
two
sisters
whisper
to
each
other
when
they
pass
this
spot
they
must
have
guessed
the
secret
of
that
somebody
who
stands
behind
the
trees
whenever
they
go
to
fetch
water
their
pitchers
lurch
suddenly
and
water
spills
when
they
reach
this
spot
they
must
have
found
out
that
somebody
heart
is
beating
who
stands
behind
the
trees
whenever
they
go
to
fetch
water
the
two
sisters
glance
at
each
other
when
they
come
to
this
spot
and
they
smile
there
is
a
laughter
in
their
feet
which
makes
confusion
in
somebody
mind
who
stands
behind
the
trees
whenever
they
go
to
fetch
water
you
walked
by
the
riverside
path
with
the
full
pitcher
upon
your
hip
why
did
you
swiftly
turn
your
face
and
peep
at
me
through
your
fluttering
veil
that
gleaming
look
from
the
dark
came
upon
me
like
a
breeze
that
sends
a
shiver
through
the
rippling
water
and
sweeps
away
to
the
shadowy
shore
it
came
to
me
like
the
bird
of
the
evening
that
hurriedly
flies
across
the
lampless
room
from
the
one
open
window
to
the
other
and
disappears
in
the
night
you
are
hidden
as
a
star
behind
the
hills
and
i
am
a
upon
the
road
but
why
did
you
stop
for
a
moment
and
glance
at
my
face
through
your
veil
while
you
walked
by
the
riverside
path
with
the
full
pitcher
upon
your
hip
day
after
day
he
comes
and
goes
away
go
and
give
him
a
flower
from
my
hair
my
friend
if
he
asks
who
was
it
that
sent
it
i
entreat
you
do
not
tell
him
my
name
for
he
only
comes
and
goes
away
he
sits
on
the
dust
under
the
tree
spread
there
a
seat
with
flowers
and
leaves
my
friend
his
eyes
are
sad
and
they
bring
sadness
to
my
heart
he
does
not
speak
what
he
has
in
mind
he
only
comes
and
goes
away
why
did
he
choose
to
come
to
my
door
the
wandering
youth
when
the
day
dawned
as
i
come
in
and
out
i
pass
by
him
every
time
and
my
eyes
are
caught
by
his
face
i
know
not
if
i
should
speak
to
him
or
keep
silent
why
did
he
choose
to
come
to
my
door
the
cloudy
nights
in
july
are
dark
the
sky
is
soft
blue
in
the
autumn
the
spring
days
are
restless
with
the
south
wind
he
weaves
his
songs
with
fresh
tunes
every
time
i
turn
from
my
work
and
my
eyes
fill
with
the
mist
why
did
he
choose
to
come
to
my
door
when
she
passed
by
me
with
quick
steps
the
end
of
her
skirt
touched
me
from
the
unknown
island
of
a
heart
came
a
sudden
warm
breath
of
spring
a
flutter
of
a
flitting
touch
brushed
me
and
vanished
in
a
moment
like
a
torn
flower
petal
blown
in
the
breeze
it
fell
upon
my
heart
like
a
sigh
of
her
body
and
whisper
of
her
heart
why
do
you
sit
there
and
jingle
your
bracelets
in
mere
idle
sport
fill
your
pitcher
it
is
time
for
you
to
come
home
why
do
you
stir
the
water
with
your
hands
and
fitfully
glance
at
the
road
for
some
one
in
mere
idle
sport
fill
your
pitcher
and
come
home
the
morning
hours
pass
by
the
dark
water
flows
on
the
waves
are
laughing
and
whispering
to
each
other
in
mere
idle
sport
the
wandering
clouds
have
gathered
at
the
edge
of
the
sky
on
yonder
rise
of
the
land
they
linger
and
look
at
your
face
and
smile
in
mere
idle
sport
fill
your
pitcher
and
come
home
do
not
keep
to
yourself
the
secret
of
your
heart
my
friend
say
it
to
me
only
to
me
in
secret
you
who
smile
so
gently
softly
whisper
my
heart
will
hear
it
not
my
ears
the
night
is
deep
the
house
is
silent
the
birds
nests
are
shrouded
with
sleep
speak
to
me
through
hesitating
tears
through
faltering
smiles
through
sweet
shame
and
pain
the
secret
of
your
heart
come
to
us
youth
tell
us
truly
why
there
is
madness
in
your
eyes
i
know
not
what
wine
of
wild
poppy
i
have
drunk
that
there
is
this
madness
in
my
eyes
ah
shame
well
some
are
wise
and
some
foolish
some
are
watchful
and
some
careless
there
are
eyes
that
smile
and
eyes
that
weep
and
madness
is
in
my
eyes
youth
why
do
you
stand
so
still
under
the
shadow
of
the
tree
my
feet
are
languid
with
the
burden
of
my
heart
and
i
stand
still
in
the
shadow
ah
shame
well
some
march
on
their
way
and
some
linger
some
are
free
and
some
are
fettered
and
my
feet
are
languid
with
the
burden
of
my
heart
what
comes
from
your
willing
hands
i
take
i
beg
for
nothing
more
yes
yes
i
know
you
modest
mendicant
you
ask
for
all
that
one
has
if
there
be
a
stray
flower
for
me
i
will
wear
it
in
my
heart
but
if
there
be
thorns
i
will
endure
them
yes
yes
i
know
you
modest
mendicant
you
ask
for
all
that
one
has
if
but
once
you
should
raise
your
loving
eyes
to
my
face
it
would
make
my
life
sweet
beyond
death
but
if
there
by
only
cruel
glances
i
will
keep
them
piercing
my
heart
yes
yes
i
know
you
modest
mendicant
you
ask
for
all
that
one
has
trust
love
even
if
it
brings
sorrow
do
not
close
up
your
heart
ah
no
my
friend
your
words
are
dark
i
can
not
understand
them
the
heart
is
only
for
giving
away
with
a
tear
and
a
song
my
love
ah
no
my
friend
your
words
are
dark
i
can
not
understand
them
pleasure
is
frail
like
a
dewdrop
while
it
laughs
it
dies
but
sorrow
is
strong
and
abiding
let
sorrowful
love
wake
in
your
eyes
ah
no
my
friend
your
words
are
dark
i
can
not
understand
them
the
lotus
blooms
in
the
sight
of
the
sun
and
loses
all
that
it
has
it
would
not
remain
in
bud
in
the
eternal
winter
mist
ah
no
my
friend
your
words
are
dark
i
can
not
understand
them
your
questioning
eyes
are
sad
they
seek
to
know
my
meaning
as
the
moon
would
fathom
the
sea
i
have
bared
my
life
before
your
eyes
from
end
to
end
with
nothing
hidden
or
held
back
that
is
why
you
know
me
not
if
it
were
only
a
gem
i
could
break
it
into
a
hundred
pieces
and
string
them
into
a
chain
to
put
on
your
neck
if
it
were
only
a
flower
round
and
small
and
sweet
i
could
pluck
it
from
its
stem
to
set
it
in
your
hair
but
it
is
a
heart
my
beloved
where
are
its
shores
and
its
bottom
you
know
not
the
limits
of
this
kingdom
still
you
are
its
queen
if
it
were
only
a
moment
of
pleasure
it
would
flower
in
an
easy
smile
and
you
could
see
it
and
read
it
in
a
moment
if
it
were
merely
a
pain
it
would
melt
in
limpid
tears
reflecting
its
inmost
secret
without
a
word
but
it
is
love
my
beloved
its
pleasure
and
pain
are
boundless
and
endless
its
wants
and
wealth
it
is
as
near
to
you
as
your
life
but
you
can
never
wholly
know
it
speak
to
me
my
love
tell
me
in
words
what
you
sang
the
night
is
dark
the
stars
are
lost
in
clouds
the
wind
is
sighing
through
the
leaves
i
will
let
loose
my
hair
my
blue
cloak
will
cling
round
me
like
night
i
will
clasp
your
head
to
my
bosom
and
there
in
the
sweet
loneliness
murmur
on
your
heart
i
will
shut
my
eyes
and
listen
i
will
not
look
in
your
face
when
your
words
are
ended
we
will
sit
still
and
silent
only
the
trees
will
whisper
in
the
dark
the
night
will
pale
the
day
will
dawn
we
shall
look
at
each
other
eyes
and
go
on
our
different
paths
speak
to
me
my
love
tell
me
in
words
what
you
sang
you
are
the
evening
cloud
floating
in
the
sky
of
my
dreams
i
paint
you
and
fashion
you
ever
with
my
love
longings
you
are
my
own
my
own
dweller
in
my
endless
dreams
your
feet
are
with
the
glow
of
my
heart
desire
gleaner
of
my
sunset
songs
your
lips
are
with
the
taste
of
my
wine
of
pain
you
are
my
own
my
own
dweller
in
my
lonesome
dreams
with
the
shadow
of
my
passion
have
i
darkened
your
eyes
haunter
of
the
depth
of
my
gaze
i
have
caught
you
and
wrapt
you
my
love
in
the
net
of
my
music
you
are
my
own
my
own
dweller
in
my
deathless
dreams
my
heart
the
bird
of
the
wilderness
has
found
its
sky
in
your
eyes
they
are
the
cradle
of
the
morning
they
are
the
kingdom
of
the
stars
my
songs
are
lost
in
their
depths
let
me
but
soar
in
that
sky
in
its
lonely
immensity
let
me
but
cleave
its
clouds
and
spread
wings
in
its
sunshine
tell
me
if
this
be
all
true
my
lover
tell
me
if
this
be
true
when
these
eyes
flash
their
lightning
the
dark
clouds
in
your
breast
make
stormy
answer
is
it
true
that
my
lips
are
sweet
like
the
opening
bud
of
the
first
conscious
love
do
the
memories
of
vanished
months
of
may
linger
in
my
limbs
does
the
earth
like
a
harp
shiver
into
songs
with
the
touch
of
my
feet
is
it
then
true
that
the
dewdrops
fall
from
the
eyes
of
night
when
i
am
seen
and
the
morning
light
is
glad
when
it
wraps
my
body
round
is
it
true
is
it
true
that
your
love
travelled
alone
through
ages
and
worlds
in
search
of
me
that
when
you
found
me
at
last
your
desire
found
utter
peace
in
my
gentle
speech
and
my
eyes
and
lips
and
flowing
hair
is
it
then
true
that
the
mystery
of
the
infinite
is
written
on
this
little
forehead
of
mine
tell
me
my
lover
if
all
this
be
true
i
love
you
beloved
forgive
me
my
love
like
a
bird
losing
its
way
i
am
caught
when
my
heart
was
shaken
it
lost
its
veil
and
was
naked
cover
it
with
pity
beloved
and
forgive
me
my
love
if
you
can
not
love
me
beloved
forgive
me
my
pain
do
not
look
askance
at
me
from
afar
i
will
steal
back
to
my
corner
and
sit
in
the
dark
with
both
hands
i
will
cover
my
naked
shame
turn
your
face
from
me
beloved
and
forgive
me
my
pain
if
you
love
me
beloved
forgive
me
my
joy
when
my
heart
is
borne
away
by
the
flood
of
happiness
do
not
smile
at
my
perilous
abandonment
when
i
sit
on
my
throne
and
rule
you
with
my
tyranny
of
love
when
like
a
goddess
i
grant
you
my
favour
bear
with
my
pride
beloved
and
forgive
me
my
joy
do
not
go
my
love
without
asking
my
leave
i
have
watched
all
night
and
now
my
eyes
are
heavy
with
sleep
i
fear
lest
i
lose
you
when
i
am
sleeping
do
not
go
my
love
without
asking
my
leave
i
start
up
and
stretch
my
hands
to
touch
you
i
ask
myself
is
it
a
dream
could
i
but
entangle
your
feet
with
my
heart
and
hold
them
fast
to
my
breast
do
not
go
my
love
without
asking
my
leave
lest
i
should
know
you
too
easily
you
play
with
me
you
blind
me
with
flashes
of
laughter
to
hide
your
tears
i
know
i
know
your
art
you
never
say
the
word
you
would
lest
i
should
not
prize
you
you
elude
me
in
a
thousand
ways
lest
i
should
confuse
you
with
the
crowd
you
stand
aside
i
know
i
know
your
art
you
never
walk
the
path
you
would
your
claim
is
more
than
that
of
others
that
is
why
you
are
silent
with
playful
carelessness
you
avoid
my
gifts
i
know
i
know
your
art
you
never
will
take
what
you
would
he
whispered
my
love
raise
your
eyes
i
sharply
chid
him
and
said
go
but
he
did
not
stir
he
stood
before
me
and
held
both
my
hands
i
said
leave
me
but
he
did
not
go
he
brought
his
face
near
my
ear
i
glanced
at
him
and
said
what
a
shame
but
he
did
not
move
his
lips
touched
my
cheek
i
trembled
and
said
you
dare
too
much
but
he
had
no
shame
he
put
a
flower
in
my
hair
i
said
it
is
useless
but
he
stood
unmoved
he
took
the
garland
from
my
neck
and
went
away
i
weep
and
ask
my
heart
why
does
he
not
come
back
would
you
put
your
wreath
of
fresh
flowers
on
my
neck
fair
one
but
you
must
know
that
the
one
wreath
that
i
had
woven
is
for
the
many
for
those
who
are
seen
in
glimpses
or
dwell
in
lands
unexplored
or
live
in
poets
songs
it
is
too
late
to
ask
my
heart
in
return
for
yours
there
was
a
time
when
my
life
was
like
a
bud
all
its
perfume
was
stored
in
its
core
now
it
is
squandered
far
and
wide
who
knows
the
enchantment
that
can
gather
and
shut
it
up
again
my
heart
is
not
mine
to
give
to
one
only
it
is
given
to
the
many
my
love
once
upon
a
time
your
poet
launched
a
great
epic
in
his
mind
alas
i
was
not
careful
and
it
struck
your
ringing
anklets
and
came
to
grief
it
broke
up
into
scraps
of
songs
and
lay
scattered
at
your
feet
all
my
cargo
of
the
stories
of
old
wars
was
tossed
by
the
laughing
waves
and
soaked
in
tears
and
sank
you
must
make
this
loss
good
to
me
my
love
if
my
claims
to
immortal
fame
after
death
are
shattered
make
me
immortal
while
i
live
and
i
will
not
mourn
for
my
loss
nor
blame
you
i
try
to
weave
a
wreath
all
the
morning
but
the
flowers
slip
and
they
drop
out
you
sit
there
watching
me
in
secret
through
the
corner
of
your
prying
eyes
ask
those
eyes
darkly
planning
mischief
whose
fault
it
was
i
try
to
sing
a
song
but
in
vain
a
hidden
smile
trembles
on
your
lips
ask
of
it
the
reason
of
my
failure
let
your
smiling
lips
say
on
oath
how
my
voice
lost
itself
in
silence
like
a
drunken
bee
in
the
lotus
it
is
evening
and
the
time
for
the
flowers
to
close
their
petals
give
me
leave
to
sit
by
your
side
and
bid
my
lips
to
do
the
work
that
can
be
done
in
silence
and
in
the
dim
light
of
stars
an
unbelieving
smile
flits
on
your
eyes
when
i
come
to
you
to
take
my
leave
i
have
done
it
so
often
that
you
think
i
will
soon
return
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
the
same
doubt
in
my
mind
for
the
spring
days
come
again
time
after
time
the
full
moon
takes
leave
and
comes
on
another
visit
the
flowers
come
again
and
blush
upon
their
branches
year
after
year
and
it
is
likely
that
i
take
my
leave
only
to
come
to
you
again
but
keep
the
illusion
awhile
do
not
send
it
away
with
ungentle
haste
when
i
say
i
leave
you
for
all
time
accept
it
as
true
and
let
a
mist
of
tears
for
one
moment
deepen
the
dark
rim
of
your
eyes
then
smile
as
archly
as
you
like
when
i
come
again
i
long
to
speak
the
deepest
words
i
have
to
say
to
you
but
i
dare
not
for
fear
you
should
laugh
that
is
why
i
laugh
at
myself
and
shatter
my
secret
in
jest
i
make
light
of
my
pain
afraid
you
should
do
so
i
long
to
tell
you
the
truest
words
i
have
to
say
to
you
but
i
dare
not
being
afraid
that
you
would
not
believe
them
that
is
why
i
disguise
them
in
untruth
saying
the
contrary
of
what
i
mean
i
make
my
pain
appear
absurd
afraid
that
you
should
do
so
i
long
to
use
the
most
precious
words
i
have
for
you
but
i
dare
not
fearing
i
should
not
be
paid
with
like
value
that
is
why
i
gave
you
hard
names
and
boast
of
my
callous
strength
i
hurt
you
for
fear
you
should
never
know
any
pain
i
long
to
sit
silent
by
you
but
i
dare
not
lest
my
heart
come
out
at
my
lips
that
is
why
i
prattle
and
chatter
lightly
and
hide
my
heart
behind
words
i
rudely
handle
my
pain
for
fear
you
should
do
so
i
long
to
go
away
from
your
side
but
i
dare
not
for
fear
my
cowardice
should
become
known
to
you
that
is
why
i
hold
my
head
high
and
carelessly
come
into
your
presence
constant
thrusts
from
your
eyes
keep
my
pain
fresh
for
ever
o
mad
superbly
drunk
if
you
kick
open
your
doors
and
play
the
fool
in
public
if
you
empty
your
bag
in
a
night
and
snap
your
fingers
at
prudence
if
you
walk
in
curious
paths
and
play
with
useless
things
reck
not
rhyme
or
reason
if
unfurling
your
sails
before
the
storm
you
snap
the
rudder
in
two
then
i
will
follow
you
comrade
and
be
drunken
and
go
to
the
dogs
i
have
wasted
my
days
and
nights
in
the
company
of
steady
wise
neighbours
much
knowing
has
turned
my
hair
grey
and
much
watching
has
made
my
sight
dim
for
years
i
have
gathered
and
heaped
up
scraps
and
fragments
of
things
crush
them
and
dance
upon
them
and
scatter
them
all
to
the
winds
for
i
know
is
the
height
of
wisdom
to
be
drunken
and
go
to
the
dogs
let
all
crooked
scruples
vanish
let
me
hopelessly
lose
my
way
let
a
gust
of
wild
giddiness
come
and
sweep
me
away
from
my
anchors
the
world
is
peopled
with
worthies
and
workers
useful
and
clever
there
are
men
who
are
easily
first
and
men
who
come
decently
after
let
them
be
happy
and
prosper
and
let
me
be
foolishly
futile
for
i
know
is
the
end
of
all
works
to
be
drunken
and
go
to
the
dogs
i
swear
to
surrender
this
moment
all
claims
to
the
ranks
of
the
decent
i
let
go
my
pride
of
learning
and
judgment
of
right
and
of
wrong
i
shatter
memory
vessel
scattering
the
last
drop
of
tears
with
the
foam
of
the
wine
i
will
bathe
and
brighten
my
laughter
the
badge
of
the
civil
and
staid
i
tear
into
shreds
for
the
nonce
i
take
the
holy
vow
to
be
worthless
to
be
drunken
and
go
to
the
dogs
no
my
friends
i
shall
never
be
an
ascetic
whatever
you
may
say
i
shall
never
be
an
ascetic
if
she
does
not
take
the
vow
with
me
it
is
my
firm
resolve
that
if
i
can
not
find
a
shady
shelter
and
a
companion
for
my
penance
i
shall
never
turn
ascetic
no
my
friends
i
shall
never
leave
my
hearth
and
home
and
retire
into
the
forest
solitude
if
rings
no
merry
laughter
in
its
echoing
shade
and
if
the
end
of
no
saffron
mantle
flutters
in
the
wind
if
its
silence
is
not
deepened
by
soft
whispers
i
shall
never
be
an
ascetic
reverend
sir
forgive
this
pair
of
sinners
spring
winds
are
blowing
in
wild
eddies
driving
dust
and
dead
leaves
away
and
with
them
your
lessons
are
all
lost
do
not
say
father
that
life
is
a
vanity
for
we
have
made
truce
with
death
for
once
and
only
for
a
few
fragrant
hours
we
two
have
been
made
immortal
even
if
the
king
army
came
and
fiercely
fell
upon
us
we
should
sadly
shake
our
heads
and
say
brothers
you
are
disturbing
us
if
you
must
have
this
noisy
game
go
and
clatter
your
arms
elsewhere
since
only
for
a
few
fleeting
moments
we
have
been
made
immortal
if
friendly
people
came
and
flocked
around
us
we
should
humbly
bow
to
them
and
say
this
extravagant
good
fortune
is
an
embarrassment
to
us
room
is
scarce
in
the
infinite
sky
where
we
dwell
for
in
the
springtime
flowers
come
in
crowds
and
the
busy
wings
of
bees
jostle
each
other
our
little
heaven
where
dwell
only
we
two
immortals
is
too
absurdly
narrow
to
the
guests
that
must
go
bid
god
speed
and
brush
away
all
traces
of
their
steps
take
to
your
bosom
with
a
smile
what
is
easy
and
simple
and
near
is
the
festival
of
phantoms
that
know
not
when
they
die
let
your
laughter
be
but
a
meaningless
mirth
like
twinkles
of
light
on
the
ripples
let
your
life
lightly
dance
on
the
edges
of
time
like
dew
on
the
tip
of
a
leaf
strike
in
chords
from
your
harp
fitful
momentary
rhythms
you
left
me
and
went
on
your
way
i
thought
i
should
mourn
for
you
and
set
your
solitary
image
in
my
heart
wrought
in
a
golden
song
but
ah
my
evil
fortune
time
is
short
youth
wanes
year
after
year
the
spring
days
are
fugitive
the
frail
flowers
die
for
nothing
and
the
wise
man
warns
me
that
life
is
but
a
on
the
lotus
leaf
should
i
neglect
all
this
to
gaze
after
one
who
has
turned
her
back
on
me
that
would
be
rude
and
foolish
for
time
is
short
then
come
my
rainy
nights
with
pattering
feet
smile
my
golden
autumn
come
careless
april
scattering
your
kisses
abroad
you
come
and
you
and
you
also
my
loves
you
know
we
are
mortals
is
it
wise
to
break
heart
for
the
one
who
takes
her
heart
away
for
time
is
short
it
is
sweet
to
sit
in
a
corner
to
muse
and
write
in
rhymes
that
you
are
all
my
world
it
is
heroic
to
hug
one
sorrow
and
determine
not
to
be
consoled
but
a
fresh
face
peeps
across
my
door
and
raises
its
eyes
to
my
eyes
i
can
not
but
wipe
away
my
tears
and
change
the
tune
of
my
song
for
time
is
short
if
you
would
have
it
so
i
will
end
my
singing
if
it
sets
your
heart
aflutter
i
will
take
away
my
eyes
from
your
face
if
it
suddenly
startles
you
in
your
walk
i
will
step
aside
and
take
another
path
if
it
confuses
you
in
your
i
will
shun
your
lonely
garden
if
it
makes
the
water
wanton
and
wild
i
will
not
row
my
boat
by
your
bank
free
me
from
the
bonds
of
your
sweetness
my
love
no
more
of
this
wine
of
kisses
this
mist
of
heavy
incense
stifles
my
heart
open
the
doors
make
room
for
the
morning
light
i
am
lost
in
you
wrapped
in
the
folds
of
your
caresses
free
me
from
your
spells
and
give
me
back
the
manhood
to
offer
you
my
freed
heart
i
hold
her
hands
and
press
her
to
my
breast
i
try
to
fill
my
arms
with
her
loveliness
to
plunder
her
sweet
smile
with
kisses
to
drink
her
dark
glances
with
my
eyes
ah
but
where
is
it
who
can
strain
the
blue
from
the
sky
i
try
to
grasp
the
beauty
it
eludes
me
leaving
only
the
body
in
my
hands
baffled
and
weary
i
come
back
how
can
the
body
touch
the
flower
which
only
the
spirit
may
touch
love
my
heart
longs
day
and
night
for
the
meeting
with
you
for
the
meeting
that
is
like
death
sweep
me
away
like
a
storm
take
everything
i
have
break
open
my
sleep
and
plunder
my
dreams
rob
me
of
my
world
in
that
devastation
in
the
utter
nakedness
of
spirit
let
us
become
one
in
beauty
alas
for
my
vain
desire
where
is
this
hope
for
union
except
in
thee
my
god
then
finish
the
last
song
and
let
us
leave
forget
this
night
when
the
night
is
no
more
whom
do
i
try
to
clasp
in
my
arms
dreams
can
never
be
made
captive
my
eager
hands
press
emptiness
to
my
heart
and
it
bruises
my
breast
why
did
the
lamp
go
out
i
shaded
it
with
my
cloak
to
save
it
from
the
wind
that
is
why
the
lamp
went
out
why
did
the
flower
fade
i
pressed
it
to
my
heart
with
anxious
love
that
is
why
the
flower
faded
why
did
the
stream
dry
up
i
put
a
dam
across
it
to
have
it
for
my
use
that
is
why
the
stream
dried
up
why
did
the
break
i
tried
to
force
a
note
that
was
beyond
its
power
that
is
why
the
is
broken
why
do
you
put
me
to
shame
with
a
look
i
have
not
come
as
a
beggar
only
for
a
passing
hour
i
stood
at
the
end
of
your
courtyard
outside
the
garden
hedge
why
do
you
put
me
to
shame
with
a
look
not
a
rose
did
i
gather
from
your
garden
not
a
fruit
did
i
pluck
i
humbly
took
my
shelter
under
the
wayside
shade
where
every
strange
traveller
may
stand
not
a
rose
did
i
pluck
yes
my
feet
were
tired
and
the
shower
of
rain
come
down
the
winds
cried
out
among
the
swaying
bamboo
branches
the
clouds
ran
across
the
sky
as
though
in
the
flight
from
defeat
my
feet
were
tired
i
know
not
what
you
thought
of
me
or
for
whom
you
were
waiting
at
your
door
flashes
of
lightning
dazzled
your
watching
eyes
how
could
i
know
that
you
could
see
me
where
i
stood
in
the
dark
i
know
not
what
you
thought
of
me
the
day
is
ended
and
the
rain
has
ceased
for
a
moment
i
leave
the
shadow
of
the
tree
at
the
end
of
your
garden
and
this
seat
on
the
grass
it
has
darkened
shut
your
door
i
go
my
way
the
day
is
ended
where
do
you
hurry
with
your
basket
this
late
evening
when
the
marketing
is
over
they
all
have
come
home
with
their
burdens
the
moon
peeps
from
above
the
village
trees
the
echoes
of
the
voices
calling
for
the
ferry
run
across
the
dark
water
to
the
distant
swamp
where
wild
ducks
sleep
where
do
you
hurry
with
your
basket
when
the
marketing
is
over
sleep
has
laid
her
fingers
upon
the
eyes
of
the
earth
the
nests
of
the
crows
have
become
silent
and
the
murmurs
of
the
bamboo
leaves
are
silent
the
labourers
home
from
their
fields
spread
their
mats
in
the
courtyards
where
do
you
hurry
with
your
basket
when
the
marketing
is
over
it
was
when
you
went
away
the
sun
was
strong
in
the
sky
i
had
done
my
work
and
sat
alone
on
my
balcony
when
you
went
away
fitful
gusts
came
winnowing
through
the
smells
of
many
distant
fields
the
doves
cooed
tireless
in
the
shade
and
a
bee
strayed
in
my
room
humming
the
news
of
many
distant
fields
the
village
slept
in
the
noonday
heat
the
road
lay
deserted
in
sudden
fits
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
rose
and
died
i
glazed
at
the
sky
and
wove
in
the
blue
the
letters
of
a
name
i
had
known
while
the
village
slept
in
the
noonday
heat
i
had
forgotten
to
braid
my
hair
the
languid
breeze
played
with
it
upon
my
cheek
the
river
ran
unruffled
under
the
shady
bank
the
lazy
white
clouds
did
not
move
i
had
forgotten
to
braid
my
hair
it
was
when
you
went
away
the
dust
of
the
road
was
hot
and
the
fields
panting
the
doves
cooed
among
the
dense
leaves
i
was
alone
in
my
balcony
when
you
went
away
i
was
one
among
many
women
busy
with
the
obscure
daily
tasks
of
the
household
why
did
you
single
me
out
and
bring
me
away
from
the
cool
shelter
of
our
common
life
love
unexpressed
in
sacred
it
shines
like
gems
in
the
gloom
of
the
hidden
heart
in
the
light
of
the
curious
day
it
looks
pitifully
dark
ah
you
broke
through
the
cover
of
my
heart
and
dragged
my
trembling
love
into
the
open
place
destroying
for
ever
the
shady
corner
where
it
hid
its
nest
the
other
women
are
the
same
as
ever
no
one
has
peeped
into
their
inmost
being
and
they
themselves
know
not
their
own
secret
lightly
they
smile
and
weep
chatter
and
work
daily
they
go
to
the
temple
light
their
lamps
and
fetch
water
from
the
river
i
hoped
my
love
would
be
saved
from
the
shivering
shame
of
the
shelterless
but
you
turn
your
face
away
yes
your
path
lies
open
before
you
but
you
have
cut
off
my
return
and
left
me
stripped
naked
before
the
world
with
its
lidless
eyes
staring
night
and
day
i
plucked
your
flower
o
world
i
pressed
it
to
my
heart
and
the
thorn
pricked
when
the
day
waned
and
it
darkened
i
found
that
the
flower
had
faded
but
the
pain
remained
more
flowers
will
come
to
you
with
perfume
and
pride
o
world
but
my
time
for
is
over
and
through
the
dark
night
i
have
not
my
rose
only
the
pain
remains
one
morning
in
the
flower
garden
a
blind
girl
came
to
offer
me
a
flower
chain
in
the
cover
of
a
lotus
leaf
i
put
it
round
my
neck
and
tears
came
to
my
eyes
i
kissed
her
and
said
you
are
blind
even
as
the
flowers
are
you
yourself
know
not
how
beautiful
is
your
gift
o
woman
you
are
not
merely
the
handiwork
of
god
but
also
of
men
these
are
ever
endowing
you
with
beauty
from
their
hearts
poets
are
weaving
for
you
a
web
with
threads
of
golden
imagery
painters
are
giving
your
form
ever
new
immortality
the
sea
gives
its
pearls
the
mines
their
gold
the
summer
gardens
their
flowers
to
deck
you
to
cover
you
to
make
you
more
precious
the
desire
of
men
hearts
has
shed
its
glory
over
your
youth
you
are
one
half
woman
and
one
half
dream
amidst
the
rush
and
roar
of
life
o
beauty
carved
in
stone
you
stand
mute
and
still
alone
and
aloof
great
time
sits
enamoured
at
your
feet
and
murmurs
speak
speak
to
me
my
love
speak
my
bride
but
your
speech
is
shut
up
in
stone
o
immovable
beauty
peace
my
heart
let
the
time
for
the
parting
be
sweet
let
it
not
be
a
death
but
completeness
let
love
melt
into
memory
and
pain
into
songs
let
the
flight
through
the
sky
end
in
the
folding
of
the
wings
over
the
nest
let
the
last
touch
of
your
hands
be
gentle
like
the
flower
of
the
night
stand
still
o
beautiful
end
for
a
moment
and
say
your
last
words
in
silence
i
bow
to
you
and
hold
up
my
lamp
to
light
you
on
your
way
in
the
dusky
path
of
a
dream
i
went
to
seek
the
love
who
was
mine
in
a
former
life
her
house
stood
at
the
end
of
a
desolate
street
in
the
evening
breeze
her
pet
peacock
sat
drowsing
on
its
perch
and
the
pigeons
were
silent
in
their
corner
she
set
her
lamp
down
by
the
portal
and
stood
before
me
she
raised
her
large
eyes
to
my
face
and
mutely
asked
are
you
well
my
friend
i
tried
to
answer
but
our
language
had
been
lost
and
forgotten
i
thought
and
thought
our
names
would
not
come
to
my
mind
tears
shone
in
her
eyes
she
held
up
her
right
hand
to
me
i
took
it
and
stood
silent
our
lamp
had
flickered
in
the
evening
breeze
and
died
traveller
must
you
go
the
night
is
still
and
the
darkness
swoons
upon
the
forest
the
lamps
are
bright
in
our
balcony
the
flowers
all
fresh
and
the
youthful
eyes
still
awake
is
the
time
for
your
parting
come
traveller
must
you
go
we
have
not
bound
your
feet
with
our
entreating
arms
your
doors
are
open
your
horse
stands
saddled
at
the
gate
if
we
have
tried
to
bar
your
passage
it
was
but
with
our
songs
did
we
ever
try
to
hold
you
back
it
was
but
with
our
eyes
traveller
we
are
helpless
to
keep
you
we
have
only
our
tears
what
quenchless
fire
glows
in
your
eyes
what
restless
fever
runs
in
your
blood
what
call
from
the
dark
urges
you
what
awful
incantation
have
you
read
among
the
stars
in
the
sky
that
with
a
sealed
secret
message
the
night
entered
your
heart
silent
and
strange
if
you
do
not
care
for
merry
meetings
if
you
must
have
peace
weary
heart
we
shall
put
our
lamps
out
and
silence
our
harps
we
shall
sit
still
in
the
dark
in
the
rustle
of
leaves
and
the
tired
moon
will
shed
pale
rays
on
your
window
o
traveller
what
sleepless
spirit
has
touched
you
from
the
heart
of
the
i
spent
my
day
on
the
scorching
hot
dust
of
the
road
now
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
i
knock
at
the
door
of
the
inn
it
is
deserted
and
in
ruins
a
grim
tree
spreads
its
hungry
clutching
roots
through
the
gaping
fissures
of
the
walls
days
have
been
when
wayfarers
came
here
to
wash
their
weary
feet
they
spread
their
mats
in
the
courtyard
in
the
dim
light
of
the
early
moon
and
sat
and
talked
of
strange
lands
they
work
refreshed
in
the
morning
when
birds
made
them
glad
and
friendly
flowers
nodded
their
heads
at
them
from
the
wayside
but
no
lighted
lamp
awaited
me
when
i
came
here
the
black
smudges
of
smoke
left
by
many
a
forgotten
evening
lamp
stare
like
blind
eyes
from
the
wall
fireflies
flit
in
the
bush
near
the
pond
and
bamboo
branches
fling
their
shadows
on
the
path
i
am
the
guest
of
no
one
at
the
end
of
my
day
the
long
night
is
before
me
and
i
am
tired
is
that
your
call
again
the
evening
has
come
weariness
clings
around
me
like
the
arms
of
entreating
love
do
you
call
me
i
had
given
all
my
day
to
you
cruel
mistress
must
you
also
rob
me
of
my
night
somewhere
there
is
an
end
to
everything
and
the
loneness
of
the
dark
is
one
own
must
your
voice
cut
through
it
and
smite
me
has
the
evening
no
music
of
sleep
at
your
gate
do
the
stars
never
climb
the
sky
above
your
pitiless
tower
do
the
flowers
never
drop
on
the
dust
in
soft
death
in
your
garden
must
you
call
me
you
unquiet
one
then
let
the
sad
eyes
of
love
vainly
watch
and
weep
let
the
lamp
burn
in
the
lonely
house
let
the
take
the
weary
labourers
to
their
home
i
leave
behind
my
dreams
and
i
hasten
to
your
call
a
wandering
madman
was
seeking
the
touchstone
with
matted
locks
tawny
and
and
body
worn
to
a
shadow
his
lips
like
the
doors
of
his
heart
his
burning
eyes
like
the
lamp
of
a
seeking
its
mate
before
him
the
endless
ocean
roared
the
garrulous
waves
ceaselessly
talked
of
hidden
treasures
mocking
the
ignorance
that
knew
not
their
meaning
maybe
he
now
had
no
hope
remaining
yet
he
would
not
rest
for
the
search
had
become
his
life
just
as
the
ocean
for
ever
lifts
its
arms
to
the
sky
for
the
unattainable
just
as
the
stars
go
in
circles
yet
seeking
a
goal
that
can
never
be
reached
even
so
on
the
lonely
shore
the
madman
with
dusty
tawny
locks
still
roamed
in
search
of
the
touchstone
one
day
a
village
boy
came
up
and
asked
tell
me
where
did
you
come
at
this
golden
chain
about
your
waist
the
madman
started
the
chain
that
once
was
iron
was
verily
gold
it
was
not
a
dream
but
he
did
not
know
when
it
had
changed
he
struck
his
forehead
wildly
where
o
where
had
he
without
knowing
it
achieved
success
it
had
grown
into
a
habit
to
pick
up
pebbles
and
touch
the
chain
and
to
throw
them
away
without
looking
to
see
if
a
change
had
come
thus
the
madman
found
and
lost
the
touchstone
the
sun
was
sinking
low
in
the
west
the
sky
was
of
gold
the
madman
returned
on
his
footsteps
to
seek
anew
the
lost
treasure
with
his
strength
gone
his
body
bent
and
his
heart
in
the
dust
like
a
tree
uprooted
though
the
evening
comes
with
slow
steps
and
has
signalled
for
all
songs
to
cease
though
your
companions
have
gone
to
their
rest
and
you
are
tired
though
fear
broods
in
the
dark
and
the
face
of
the
sky
is
veiled
yet
bird
o
my
bird
listen
to
me
do
not
close
your
wings
that
is
not
the
gloom
of
the
leaves
of
the
forest
that
is
the
sea
swelling
like
a
dark
black
snake
that
is
not
the
dance
of
the
flowering
jasmine
that
is
flashing
foam
ah
where
is
the
sunny
green
shore
where
is
your
nest
bird
o
my
bird
listen
to
me
do
not
close
your
wings
the
lone
night
lies
along
your
path
the
dawn
sleeps
behind
the
shadowy
hills
the
stars
hold
their
breath
counting
the
hours
the
feeble
moon
swims
the
deep
night
bird
o
my
bird
listen
to
me
do
not
close
your
wings
there
is
no
hope
no
fear
for
you
there
is
no
word
no
whisper
no
cry
there
is
no
home
no
bed
for
rest
there
is
only
your
own
pair
of
wings
and
the
pathless
sky
bird
o
my
bird
listen
to
me
do
not
close
your
wings
none
lives
for
ever
brother
and
nothing
lasts
for
long
keep
that
in
mind
and
rejoice
our
life
is
not
the
one
old
burden
our
path
is
not
the
one
long
journey
one
sole
poet
has
not
to
sing
one
aged
song
the
flower
fades
and
dies
but
he
who
wears
the
flower
has
not
to
mourn
for
it
for
ever
brother
keep
that
in
mind
and
rejoice
there
must
come
a
full
pause
to
weave
perfection
into
music
life
droops
toward
its
sunset
to
be
drowned
in
the
golden
shadows
love
must
be
called
from
its
play
to
drink
sorrow
and
be
borne
to
the
heaven
of
tears
brother
keep
that
in
mind
and
rejoice
we
hasten
to
gather
our
flowers
lest
they
are
plundered
by
the
passing
winds
it
quickens
our
blood
and
brightens
our
eyes
to
snatch
kisses
that
would
vanish
if
we
delayed
our
life
is
eager
our
desires
are
keen
for
time
tolls
the
bell
of
parting
brother
keep
that
in
mind
and
rejoice
there
is
not
time
for
us
to
clasp
a
thing
and
crush
it
and
fling
it
away
to
the
dust
the
hours
trip
rapidly
away
hiding
their
dreams
in
their
skirts
our
life
is
short
it
yields
but
a
few
days
for
love
were
it
for
work
and
drudgery
it
would
be
endlessly
long
brother
keep
that
in
mind
and
rejoice
beauty
is
sweet
to
us
because
she
dances
to
the
same
fleeting
tune
with
our
lives
knowledge
is
precious
to
us
because
we
shall
never
have
time
to
complete
it
all
is
done
and
finished
in
the
eternal
heaven
but
earth
flowers
of
illusion
are
kept
eternally
fresh
by
death
brother
keep
that
in
mind
and
rejoice
i
hunt
for
the
golden
stag
you
may
smile
my
friends
but
i
pursue
the
vision
that
eludes
me
i
run
across
hills
and
dales
i
wander
through
nameless
lands
because
i
am
hunting
for
the
golden
stag
you
come
and
buy
in
the
market
and
go
back
to
your
homes
laden
with
goods
but
the
spell
of
the
homeless
winds
has
touched
me
i
know
not
when
and
where
i
have
no
care
in
my
heart
all
my
belongings
i
have
left
far
behind
me
i
run
across
hills
and
dales
i
wander
through
nameless
lands
because
i
am
hunting
for
the
golden
stag
i
remember
a
day
in
my
childhood
i
floated
a
paper
boat
in
the
ditch
it
was
a
wet
day
of
july
i
was
alone
and
happy
over
my
play
i
floated
my
paper
boat
in
the
ditch
suddenly
the
storm
clouds
thickened
winds
came
in
gusts
and
rain
poured
in
torrents
rills
of
muddy
water
rushed
and
swelled
the
stream
and
sunk
my
boat
bitterly
i
thought
in
my
mind
that
the
storm
came
on
purpose
to
spoil
my
happiness
all
its
malice
was
against
me
the
cloudy
day
of
july
is
long
today
and
i
have
been
musing
over
all
those
games
in
life
wherein
i
was
loser
i
was
blaming
my
fate
for
the
many
tricks
it
played
on
me
when
suddenly
i
remembered
the
paper
boat
that
sank
in
the
ditch
the
day
is
not
yet
done
the
fair
is
not
over
the
fair
on
the
i
had
feared
that
my
time
had
been
squandered
and
my
last
penny
lost
but
no
my
brother
i
have
still
something
left
my
fate
has
not
cheated
me
of
everything
the
selling
and
buying
are
over
all
the
dues
on
both
sides
have
been
gathered
in
and
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
home
but
gatekeeper
do
you
ask
for
your
toll
do
not
fear
i
have
still
something
left
my
fate
has
not
cheated
me
of
everything
the
lull
in
the
wind
threatens
storm
and
the
lowering
clouds
in
the
west
bode
no
good
the
hushed
water
waits
for
the
wind
i
hurry
to
cross
the
river
before
the
night
overtakes
me
o
ferryman
you
want
your
fee
yes
brother
i
have
still
something
left
my
fate
has
not
cheated
me
of
everything
in
the
wayside
under
the
tree
sits
the
beggar
alas
he
looks
at
my
face
with
a
timid
hope
he
thinks
i
am
rich
with
the
day
profit
yes
brother
i
have
still
something
left
my
fate
has
not
cheated
me
of
everything
the
night
grows
dark
and
the
road
lonely
fireflies
gleam
among
the
leaves
who
are
you
that
follow
me
with
stealthy
silent
steps
ah
i
know
it
is
your
desire
to
rob
me
of
all
my
gains
i
will
not
disappoint
you
for
i
still
have
something
left
and
my
fate
has
not
cheated
me
of
everything
at
midnight
i
reach
home
my
hands
are
empty
you
are
waiting
with
anxious
eyes
at
my
door
sleepless
and
silent
like
a
timorous
bird
you
fly
to
my
breast
with
eager
love
ay
ay
my
god
much
remains
still
my
fate
has
not
cheated
me
of
everything
with
days
of
hard
travail
i
raised
a
temple
it
had
no
doors
or
windows
its
walls
were
thickly
built
with
massive
stones
i
forgot
all
else
i
shunned
all
the
world
i
gazed
in
rapt
contemplation
at
the
image
i
had
set
upon
the
altar
it
was
always
night
inside
and
lit
by
the
lamps
of
perfumed
oil
the
ceaseless
smoke
of
incense
wound
my
heart
in
its
heavy
coils
sleepless
i
carved
on
the
walls
fantastic
figures
in
mazy
bewildering
lines
winged
horses
flowers
with
human
faces
women
with
limbs
like
serpents
no
passage
was
left
anywhere
through
which
could
enter
the
song
of
birds
the
murmur
of
leaves
or
hum
of
the
busy
village
the
only
sound
that
echoed
in
its
dark
dome
was
that
of
incantations
which
i
chanted
my
mind
became
keen
and
still
like
a
pointed
flame
my
senses
swooned
in
ecstasy
i
knew
not
how
time
passed
till
the
thunderstone
had
struck
the
temple
and
a
pain
stung
me
through
the
heart
the
lamp
looked
pale
and
ashamed
the
carvings
on
the
walls
like
chained
dreams
stared
meaningless
in
the
light
as
they
would
fain
hide
themselves
i
looked
at
the
image
on
the
altar
i
saw
it
smiling
and
alive
with
the
living
touch
of
god
the
night
i
had
imprisoned
had
spread
its
wings
and
vanished
infinite
wealth
is
not
yours
my
patient
and
dusky
mother
dust
you
toil
to
fill
the
mouths
of
your
children
but
food
is
scarce
the
gift
of
gladness
that
you
have
for
us
is
never
perfect
the
toys
that
you
make
for
your
children
are
fragile
you
can
not
satisfy
all
our
hungry
hopes
but
should
i
desert
you
for
that
your
smile
which
is
shadowed
with
pain
is
sweet
to
my
eyes
your
love
which
knows
not
fulfilment
is
dear
to
my
heart
from
your
breast
you
have
fed
us
with
life
but
not
immortality
that
is
why
your
eyes
are
ever
wakeful
for
ages
you
are
working
with
colour
and
song
yet
your
heaven
is
not
built
but
only
its
sad
suggestion
over
your
creations
of
beauty
there
is
the
mist
of
tears
i
will
pour
my
songs
into
your
mute
heart
and
my
love
into
your
love
i
will
worship
you
with
labour
i
have
seen
your
tender
face
and
i
love
your
mournful
dust
mother
earth
in
the
world
audience
hall
the
simple
blade
of
grass
sits
on
the
same
carpet
with
the
sunbeam
and
the
stars
of
midnight
thus
my
songs
share
their
seats
in
the
heart
of
the
world
with
the
music
of
the
clouds
and
forests
but
you
man
of
riches
your
wealth
has
no
part
in
the
simple
grandeur
of
the
sun
glad
gold
and
the
mellow
gleam
of
the
musing
moon
the
blessing
of
sky
is
not
shed
upon
it
and
when
death
appears
it
pales
and
withers
and
crumbles
into
dust
at
midnight
the
ascetic
announced
this
is
the
time
to
give
up
my
home
and
seek
for
god
ah
who
has
held
me
so
long
in
delusion
here
god
whispered
i
but
the
ears
of
the
man
were
stopped
with
a
baby
asleep
at
her
breast
lay
his
wife
peacefully
sleeping
on
one
side
of
the
bed
the
man
said
who
are
ye
that
have
fooled
me
so
long
the
voice
said
again
they
are
god
but
he
heard
it
not
the
baby
cried
out
in
its
dream
nestling
close
to
its
mother
god
commanded
stop
fool
leave
not
thy
home
but
still
he
heard
not
god
sighed
and
complained
why
does
my
servant
wander
to
seek
me
forsaking
me
the
fair
was
on
before
the
temple
it
had
rained
from
the
early
morning
and
the
day
came
to
its
end
brighter
than
all
the
gladness
of
the
crowd
was
the
bright
smile
of
a
girl
who
bought
for
a
farthing
a
whistle
of
palm
leaf
the
shrill
joy
of
that
whistle
floated
above
all
laughter
and
noise
an
endless
throng
of
people
came
and
jostled
together
the
road
was
muddy
the
river
in
flood
the
field
under
water
in
ceaseless
rain
greater
than
all
the
troubles
of
the
crowd
was
a
little
trouble
he
had
not
a
farthing
to
buy
a
painted
stick
his
wistful
eyes
gazing
at
the
shop
made
this
whole
meeting
of
men
so
pitiful
the
workman
and
his
wife
from
the
west
country
are
busy
digging
to
make
bricks
for
the
kiln
their
little
daughter
goes
to
the
by
the
river
there
she
has
no
end
of
scouring
and
scrubbing
of
pots
and
pans
her
little
brother
with
shaven
head
and
brown
naked
covered
limbs
follows
after
her
and
waits
patiently
on
the
high
bank
at
her
bidding
she
goes
back
home
with
the
full
pitcher
poised
on
her
head
the
shining
brass
pot
in
her
left
hand
holding
the
child
with
her
right
she
the
tiny
servant
of
her
mother
grave
with
the
weight
of
the
household
cares
one
day
i
saw
this
naked
boy
sitting
with
legs
outstretched
in
the
water
his
sister
sat
rubbing
a
with
a
handful
of
earth
turning
it
round
and
round
near
by
a
lamb
stood
gazing
along
the
bank
it
came
close
to
where
the
boy
sat
and
suddenly
bleated
aloud
and
the
child
started
up
and
screamed
his
sister
left
off
cleaning
her
pot
and
ran
up
she
took
up
her
brother
in
one
arm
and
the
lamb
in
the
other
and
dividing
her
caresses
between
them
bound
in
one
bond
of
affection
the
offspring
of
beast
and
man
it
was
in
may
the
sultry
noon
seemed
endlessly
long
the
dry
earth
gaped
with
thirst
in
the
heat
when
i
heard
from
the
riverside
a
voice
calling
come
my
darling
i
shut
my
book
and
opened
the
window
to
look
out
i
saw
a
big
buffalo
with
hide
standing
near
the
river
with
placid
patient
eyes
and
a
youth
knee
deep
in
water
calling
it
to
its
bath
i
smiled
amused
and
felt
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
my
heart
i
often
wonder
where
lie
hidden
the
boundaries
of
recognition
between
man
and
the
beast
whose
heart
knows
no
spoken
language
through
what
primal
paradise
in
a
remote
morning
of
creation
ran
the
simple
path
by
which
their
hearts
visited
each
other
those
marks
of
their
constant
tread
have
not
been
effaced
though
their
kinship
has
been
long
forgotten
yet
suddenly
in
some
wordless
music
the
dim
memory
wakes
up
and
the
beast
gazes
into
the
man
face
with
a
tender
trust
and
the
man
looks
down
into
its
eyes
with
amused
affection
it
seems
that
the
two
friends
meet
masked
and
vaguely
know
each
other
through
the
disguise
with
a
glance
of
your
eyes
you
could
plunder
all
the
wealth
of
songs
struck
from
poets
harps
fair
woman
but
for
their
praises
you
have
no
ear
therefore
i
come
to
praise
you
you
could
humble
at
your
feet
the
proudest
heads
in
the
world
but
it
is
your
loved
ones
unknown
to
fame
whom
you
choose
to
worship
therefore
i
worship
you
the
perfection
of
your
arms
would
add
glory
to
kingly
splendour
with
their
touch
but
you
use
them
to
sweep
away
the
dust
and
to
make
clean
your
humble
home
therefore
i
am
filled
with
awe
why
do
you
whisper
so
faintly
in
my
ears
o
death
my
death
when
the
flowers
droop
in
the
evening
and
cattle
come
back
to
their
stalls
you
stealthily
come
to
my
side
and
speak
words
that
i
do
not
understand
is
this
how
you
must
woo
and
win
me
with
the
opiate
of
drowsy
murmur
and
cold
kisses
o
death
my
death
will
there
be
no
proud
ceremony
for
our
wedding
will
you
not
tie
up
with
a
wreath
your
tawny
coiled
locks
is
there
none
to
carry
your
banner
before
you
and
will
not
the
night
be
on
fire
with
your
red
o
death
my
death
come
with
your
sounding
come
in
the
sleepless
night
dress
me
with
a
crimson
mantle
grasp
my
hand
and
take
me
let
your
chariot
be
ready
at
my
door
with
your
horses
neighing
impatiently
raise
my
veil
and
look
at
my
face
proudly
o
death
my
death
we
are
to
play
the
game
of
death
my
bride
and
i
the
night
is
black
the
clouds
in
the
sky
are
capricious
and
the
waves
are
raving
at
sea
we
have
left
our
bed
of
dreams
flung
open
the
door
and
come
out
my
bride
and
i
we
sit
upon
a
swing
and
the
storm
winds
give
us
a
wild
push
from
behind
my
bride
starts
up
with
fear
and
delight
she
trembles
and
clings
to
my
breast
long
have
i
served
her
tenderly
i
made
for
her
a
bed
of
flowers
and
i
closed
the
doors
to
shut
out
the
rude
light
from
her
eyes
i
kissed
her
gently
on
her
lips
and
whispered
softly
in
her
ears
till
she
half
swooned
in
languor
she
was
lost
in
the
endless
mist
of
vague
sweetness
she
answered
not
to
my
touch
my
songs
failed
to
arouse
her
has
come
to
us
the
call
of
the
storm
from
the
wild
my
bride
has
shivered
and
stood
up
she
has
clasped
my
hand
and
come
out
her
hair
is
flying
in
the
wind
her
veil
is
fluttering
her
garland
rustles
over
her
breast
the
push
of
death
has
swung
her
into
life
we
are
face
to
face
and
heart
to
heart
my
bride
and
i
she
dwelt
on
the
hillside
by
the
edge
of
a
near
the
spring
that
flows
in
laughing
rills
through
the
solemn
shadows
of
ancient
trees
the
women
came
there
to
fill
their
jars
and
travellers
would
sit
there
to
rest
and
talk
she
worked
and
dreamed
daily
to
the
tune
of
the
bubbling
stream
one
evening
the
stranger
came
down
from
the
peak
his
locks
were
tangled
like
drowsy
snakes
we
asked
in
wonder
who
are
you
he
answered
not
but
sat
by
the
garrulous
stream
and
silently
gazed
at
the
hut
where
she
dwelt
our
hearts
quaked
in
fear
and
we
came
back
home
when
it
was
night
next
morning
when
the
women
came
to
fetch
water
at
the
spring
by
the
trees
they
found
the
doors
open
in
her
hut
but
her
voice
was
gone
and
where
was
her
smiling
face
the
empty
jar
lay
on
the
floor
and
her
lamp
had
burnt
itself
out
in
the
corner
no
one
knew
where
she
had
fled
to
before
it
was
morning
and
the
stranger
had
gone
in
the
month
of
may
the
sun
grew
strong
and
the
snow
melted
and
we
sat
by
the
spring
and
wept
we
wondered
in
our
mind
is
there
a
spring
in
the
land
where
she
has
gone
and
where
she
can
fill
her
vessel
in
these
hot
thirsty
days
and
we
asked
each
other
in
dismay
is
there
a
land
beyond
these
hills
where
we
live
it
was
a
summer
night
the
breeze
blew
from
the
south
and
i
sat
in
her
deserted
room
where
the
lamp
stood
still
unlit
when
suddenly
from
before
my
eyes
the
hills
vanished
like
curtains
drawn
aside
ah
it
is
she
who
comes
how
are
you
my
child
are
you
happy
but
where
can
you
shelter
under
this
open
sky
and
alas
our
spring
is
not
here
to
allay
your
thirst
here
is
the
same
sky
she
said
only
free
from
the
fencing
hills
this
is
the
same
stream
grown
into
a
river
the
same
earth
widened
into
a
plain
everything
is
here
i
sighed
only
we
are
not
she
smiled
sadly
and
said
you
are
in
my
heart
i
woke
up
and
heard
the
babbling
of
the
stream
and
the
rustling
of
the
at
night
over
the
green
and
yellow
sweep
the
shadows
of
the
autumn
clouds
followed
by
the
swift
chasing
sun
the
bees
forget
to
sip
their
honey
drunken
with
light
they
foolishly
hover
and
hum
the
ducks
in
the
islands
of
the
river
clamour
in
joy
for
mere
nothing
let
none
go
back
home
brothers
this
morning
let
none
go
to
work
let
us
take
the
blue
sky
by
storm
and
plunder
space
as
we
run
laughter
floats
in
the
air
like
foam
on
the
flood
brothers
let
us
squander
our
morning
in
futile
songs
who
are
you
reader
reading
my
poems
an
hundred
years
hence
i
can
not
send
you
one
single
flower
from
this
wealth
of
the
spring
one
single
streak
of
gold
from
yonder
clouds
open
your
doors
and
look
abroad
from
your
blossoming
garden
gather
fragrant
memories
of
the
vanished
flowers
of
an
hundred
years
before
in
the
joy
of
your
heart
may
you
feel
the
living
joy
that
sang
one
spring
morning
sending
its
glad
voice
across
an
hundred
years
index
of
first
words
no
a
wandering
madman
was
seeking
the
touchstone
ah
me
why
did
they
build
my
house
ah
poet
the
evening
draws
near
amidst
the
rush
and
roar
of
life
an
unbelieving
smile
flits
on
your
eyes
at
midnight
the
ascetic
announced
come
as
you
are
do
not
loiter
over
your
toilet

to
us

after
day

and

love

leave

to
yourself
the
secret
of
your
heart

from
the
bonds
of
your
sweetness

love

the
edge
of
the
wood

hands
and

to
my
breast

for

golden
stag

words

a
day

childhood

run
as
a
runs
in
the
shadow
of
the
forest

spent
my
day
on
the
scorching
hot
dust
of
the
road
i
try
to
weave
a
wreath
all
the
morning
i
was
one
among
many
women
i
was
walking
by
the
road
i
do
not
know
why
if
you
would
be
busy
and
fill
your
pitcher
come
if
you
would
have
it
so
i
will
end
my
singing
in
the
dusky
path
of
a
dream
i
went
to
seek
the
love
in
the
morning
i
cast
my
net
into
the
sea
in
the
world
audience

wealth

time

fair
is
not
over
the
fair
was
on
before
the
temple
the
tame
bird
was
in
a
cage
the
workman
and
his
wife
from
the
west
country
the
yellow
bird
sings
in
their
tree
then
finish
the
last
song
and
let
us
leave
though
the
evening
comes
with
slow
steps
to
the
guests
that
must
go
bid
god
speed
traveller
must
you
go
trust
love
even
if
it
brings
sorrow
we
are
to
play
the
game
of
death
what
comes
from
your
willing
hands
i
take
when
i
go
alone
at
night
to
my
when
she
passed
by
me
with
quick
steps
when
the
lamp
went
out
by
my
bed
when
the
two
sisters
go
to
fetch
water
where
do
you
hurry
with
your
basket
who
are
you
reader
reading
my
poems
why
did
he
choose
to
come
to
my
door
why
did
the
lamp
go
out
why
do
you
put
me
to
shame
with
a
look
why
do
you
sit
there
and
jingle
your
bracelets
why
do
you
whisper
so
faintly
in
my
ears
with
a
glance
of
your
eyes
you
could
plunder
with
days
of
hard
travail
i
raised
a
temple
would
you
put
your
wreath
of
fresh
flowers
on
my
neck
you
are
the
evening
cloud
floating
in
the
sky
of
my
dreams
you
left
me
and
went
on
your
way
you
walked
by
the
riverside
path
your
questioning
eyes
are
sad
