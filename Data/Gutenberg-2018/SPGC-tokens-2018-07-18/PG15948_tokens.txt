the
hollow
land
william
morris
we
find
in
ancient
story
wonders
many
told
of
heroes
in
great
glory
with
spirit
free
and
bold
of
joyances
and
of
weeping
and
of
woe
of
noble
reckon
striving
mote
ye
now
wonders
know
niebelungen
lied
see
carlylefs
miscellanies
struggling
in
the
world
do
you
know
where
it
is
the
hollow
land
i
have
been
looking
for
it
now
so
long
trying
to
find
it
again
the
hollow
land
for
there
i
saw
my
love
first
i
wish
to
tell
you
how
i
found
it
first
of
all
but
i
am
old
my
memory
fails
me
you
must
wait
and
let
me
think
if
i
perchance
can
tell
you
how
it
happened
yea
in
my
ears
is
a
confused
noise
of
singing
over
desolate
moors
in
my
ears
and
eyes
a
clashing
and
clanging
of
a
ringing
and
glittering
of
steel
lips
set
teeth
shouts
shrieks
and
curses
how
was
it
that
no
one
of
us
ever
found
it
till
that
day
for
it
is
near
our
country
but
what
time
have
we
to
look
for
it
or
any
good
thing
with
such
biting
carking
cares
hemming
us
in
on
every
about
great
things
mighty
things
my
brothers
or
rather
little
things
enough
if
we
only
knew
it
lives
passed
in
turmoil
in
making
one
another
unhappy
in
bitterest
misunderstanding
of
our
brothers
hearts
making
those
sad
whom
god
has
not
made
sad
alas
alas
what
chance
for
any
of
us
to
find
the
hollow
land
what
time
even
to
look
for
it
yet
who
has
not
dreamed
of
it
who
half
miserable
yet
the
while
for
that
he
knows
it
is
but
a
dream
has
not
felt
the
cool
waves
round
his
feet
the
roses
crowning
him
and
through
the
leaves
of
beech
and
lime
the
many
whispering
winds
of
the
hollow
land
now
my
name
was
florian
and
my
house
was
the
house
of
the
lilies
and
of
that
house
was
my
father
lord
and
after
him
my
eldest
brother
amald
and
me
they
called
florian
de
liliis
moreover
when
my
father
was
dead
there
arose
a
feud
between
the
lilies
house
and
red
harald
and
this
that
follows
is
the
history
of
it
lady
swanhilda
red
harald
mother
was
a
widow
with
one
son
red
harald
and
when
she
had
been
in
widowhood
two
years
being
of
princely
blood
and
besides
comely
and
fierce
king
urrayne
sent
to
demand
her
in
marriage
and
i
remember
seeing
the
procession
leaving
the
town
when
i
was
quite
a
child
and
many
young
knights
and
squires
attended
the
lady
swanhilda
as
pages
and
amongst
them
amald
my
eldest
brother
and
as
i
gazed
out
of
the
window
i
saw
him
walking
by
the
side
of
her
horse
dressed
in
white
and
gold
very
delicately
but
as
he
went
it
chanced
that
he
stumbled
now
he
was
one
of
those
that
held
a
golden
canopy
over
the
lady
head
so
that
it
now
sunk
into
wrinkles
and
the
lady
had
to
bow
her
head
full
low
and
even
then
the
gold
brocade
caught
in
one
of
the
long
slim
gold
flowers
that
were
wrought
round
about
the
crown
she
wore
she
flushed
up
in
her
rage
and
her
smooth
face
went
suddenly
into
the
carven
wrinkles
of
a
wooden
and
she
caught
at
the
brocade
with
her
left
hand
and
pulled
it
away
furiously
so
that
the
warp
and
woof
were
twisted
out
of
their
place
and
many
gold
threads
were
left
dangling
about
the
crown
but
swanhilda
stared
about
when
she
rose
then
smote
my
brother
across
the
mouth
with
her
gilded
sceptre
and
the
red
blood
flowed
all
about
his
garments
yet
he
only
turned
exceeding
pale
and
dared
say
no
word
though
he
was
heir
to
the
house
of
the
lilies
but
my
small
heart
swelled
with
rage
and
i
vowed
revenge
and
as
it
seems
he
did
too
so
when
swanhilda
had
been
queen
three
years
she
suborned
many
of
king
urrayne
knights
and
lords
and
slew
her
husband
as
he
slept
and
reigned
in
his
stead
and
her
son
harald
grew
up
to
manhood
and
was
counted
a
strong
knight
and
well
spoken
of
by
then
i
first
put
on
my
armour
then
one
night
as
i
lay
dreaming
i
felt
a
hand
laid
on
my
face
and
starting
up
saw
arnald
before
me
fully
armed
he
said
florian
rise
and
arm
i
did
so
all
but
my
helm
as
he
was
he
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
his
lips
felt
hot
and
dry
and
when
they
bought
torches
and
i
could
see
his
face
plainly
i
saw
he
was
very
pale
he
said
do
you
remember
florian
this
day
sixteen
years
ago
it
is
a
long
time
but
i
shall
never
forget
it
unless
this
night
blots
out
its
memory
i
knew
what
he
meant
and
because
my
heart
was
wicked
i
rejoiced
exceedingly
at
the
thought
of
vengeance
so
that
i
could
not
speak
but
only
laid
my
palm
across
his
lips
good
you
have
a
good
memory
florian
see
now
i
waited
long
and
long
i
said
at
first
i
forgive
her
but
when
the
news
came
concerning
the
death
of
the
king
and
how
that
she
was
shameless
i
said
i
will
take
it
as
a
sign
if
god
does
not
punish
her
within
certain
years
that
he
means
me
to
do
so
and
i
have
been
watching
and
watching
now
these
two
years
for
an
opportunity
and
behold
it
is
come
at
last
and
i
think
god
has
certainly
given
her
into
our
hands
for
she
rests
this
night
this
very
christmas
eve
at
a
small
walled
town
on
the
frontier
not
two
hours
gallop
from
this
they
keep
little
ward
there
and
the
night
is
wild
moreover
the
prior
of
a
certain
house
of
monks
just
without
the
walls
is
my
fast
friend
in
this
matter
for
she
has
done
him
some
great
injury
in
the
courtyard
below
a
hundred
and
fifty
knights
and
squires
all
faithful
and
true
are
waiting
for
us
one
moment
and
we
shall
be
gone
then
we
both
knelt
down
and
prayed
god
to
give
her
into
our
hands
we
put
on
our
helms
and
went
down
into
the
courtyard
it
was
the
first
time
i
expected
to
use
a
sharp
sword
in
anger
and
i
was
full
of
joy
as
the
muffled
thunder
of
our
rolled
through
the
bitter
winter
night
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
we
had
crossed
the
frontier
and
in
half
an
hour
more
the
greater
part
bad
halted
in
a
wood
near
the
abbey
while
i
and
a
few
others
went
up
to
the
abbey
gates
and
knocked
loudly
four
times
with
my
stamping
on
the
ground
meantime
a
long
low
whistle
answered
me
from
within
which
i
in
my
turn
answered
then
the
wicket
opened
and
a
monk
came
out
holding
a
lantern
he
seemed
yet
in
the
prime
of
life
and
was
a
tall
powerful
man
he
held
the
lantern
to
my
face
then
smiled
and
said
the
banners
hang
low
i
gave
the
countersign
the
crest
is
lopped
off
good
my
son
said
he
the
ladders
are
within
here
i
dare
not
trust
any
of
the
brethren
to
carry
them
for
you
though
they
love
not
the
witch
either
but
are
timorsome
no
matter
i
said
i
have
men
here
so
they
entered
and
began
to
shoulder
the
tall
ladders
the
prior
was
very
busy
you
will
find
them
just
the
right
length
my
son
trust
me
for
that
he
seemed
quite
a
jolly
pleasant
man
i
could
not
understand
his
nursing
furious
revenge
but
his
face
darkened
strangely
whenever
he
happened
to
mention
her
name
as
we
were
starting
he
came
and
stood
outside
the
gate
and
putting
his
lantern
down
that
the
light
of
it
might
not
confuse
his
sight
looked
earnestly
into
the
night
then
said
the
wind
has
fallen
the
snow
flakes
get
thinner
and
smaller
every
moment
in
an
hour
it
will
be
freezing
hard
and
will
be
quite
clear
everything
the
surprise
being
complete
stop
a
few
minutes
yet
my
son
he
went
away
chuckling
and
returned
presently
with
two
more
sturdy
monks
carrying
something
they
threw
their
burdens
down
before
my
feet
they
consisted
of
all
the
white
albs
in
the
abbey
there
trust
an
old
man
who
has
seen
more
than
one
stricken
fight
in
his
carnal
days
let
the
men
who
scale
the
walls
put
these
over
their
arms
and
they
will
not
be
seen
in
the
least
god
make
your
sword
sharp
my
son
so
we
departed
and
when
i
met
amald
again
he
said
that
what
the
prior
had
done
was
well
thought
of
so
we
agreed
that
i
should
take
thirty
men
an
old
squire
of
our
house
well
skilled
in
war
along
with
them
scale
the
walls
as
quietly
as
possible
and
open
the
gates
to
the
rest
i
set
off
accordingly
after
that
with
low
laughing
we
had
put
the
albs
all
over
us
wrapping
the
ladders
also
in
white
then
we
crept
very
warily
and
slowly
up
to
the
wall
the
moat
was
frozen
over
and
on
the
ice
the
snow
lay
quite
thick
we
all
thought
that
the
guards
must
be
careless
enough
when
they
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
break
the
ice
in
the
moat
so
we
there
was
no
sound
at
all
the
christmas
midnight
mass
had
long
ago
been
over
it
was
nearly
three
and
the
moon
began
to
clear
there
was
scarce
any
snow
falling
now
only
a
flake
or
two
from
some
low
hurrying
cloud
or
other
the
wind
sighed
gently
about
the
round
towers
there
but
it
was
bitter
cold
for
it
had
begun
to
freeze
again
we
listened
for
some
minutes
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
think
then
at
a
sign
from
me
they
raised
the
ladders
carefully
muffled
as
they
were
at
the
top
with
swathings
of
wool
i
mounted
first
old
squire
hugh
followed
last
noiselessly
we
ascended
and
soon
stood
altogether
on
the
walls
then
we
carefully
lowered
the
ladders
again
with
long
ropes
we
got
our
swords
and
axes
from
out
of
the
folds
of
our
priests
raiments
and
set
forward
till
we
reached
the
first
tower
along
the
wall
the
door
was
open
in
the
chamber
at
the
top
there
was
a
fire
slowly
smouldering
nothing
else
we
passed
through
it
and
began
to
go
down
the
spiral
staircase
i
first
with
my
axe
shortened
in
my
what
if
we
were
surprised
there
i
thought
and
i
longed
to
be
out
in
the
air
again
what
if
the
door
were
fast
at
the
bottom
as
we
passed
the
second
chamber
we
heard
some
one
within
snoring
loudly
i
looked
in
quietly
and
saw
a
big
man
with
long
black
hair
that
fell
off
his
pillow
and
swept
the
ground
lying
snoring
with
his
nose
turned
up
and
his
mouth
open
but
he
seemed
so
sound
asleep
that
we
did
not
stop
to
slay
him
praise
be
the
door
was
open
without
even
a
whispered
word
without
a
pause
we
went
on
along
the
streets
on
the
side
that
the
drift
had
been
on
because
our
garments
were
white
for
the
wind
being
very
strong
all
that
day
the
houses
on
that
side
had
caught
in
their
cornices
and
carvings
and
on
the
rough
stone
and
wood
of
them
so
much
snow
that
except
here
and
there
where
the
black
walls
grinned
out
they
were
quite
white
no
man
saw
us
as
we
stole
along
noiselessly
because
of
the
snow
till
we
stood
within
yards
of
the
gates
and
their
house
of
guard
and
we
stood
because
we
heard
the
voice
of
some
one
singing
queen
mary
crown
was
gold
king
joseph
crown
was
red
but
jesus
crown
was
diamond
that
lit
up
all
the
bed
mariae
virginis
so
they
had
some
guards
after
all
this
was
clearly
the
sentinel
that
sang
to
keep
the
ghosts
off
for
a
drew
nearer
a
few
yards
nearer
then
stopped
to
free
ourselves
from
our
monks
clothes
ships
sail
through
the
heaven
with
red
banners
dress
carrying
the
planets
seven
to
see
the
white
breast
mariae
virginis
thereat
he
must
have
seen
the
waving
of
some
alb
or
other
as
it
shivered
down
to
the
ground
for
his
spear
fell
with
a
thud
and
he
seemed
to
be
standing
thinking
something
about
ghosts
then
plucking
up
heart
of
grace
he
roared
out
like
ten
and
dashed
into
the
we
followed
smartly
but
without
hurry
and
came
up
to
the
door
of
it
just
as
some
dozen
men
came
tumbling
out
under
our
axes
thereupon
while
our
men
slew
them
i
blew
a
great
blast
upon
my
horn
and
hugh
with
some
others
drew
bolt
and
bar
and
swung
the
gates
wide
open
then
the
men
in
the
understood
they
were
taken
in
a
trap
and
began
to
stir
with
great
confusion
so
lest
they
should
get
quite
waked
and
armed
i
left
hugh
at
the
gates
with
ten
men
and
myself
led
the
rest
into
that
house
there
while
we
slew
all
those
that
yielded
not
came
arnald
with
the
others
bringing
our
horses
with
them
then
all
the
enemy
threw
their
arms
down
and
we
counted
our
prisoners
and
found
them
over
fourscore
therefore
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
them
for
they
were
too
many
to
guard
and
it
seemed
unknightly
to
slay
them
all
we
sent
up
some
bowmen
to
the
walls
and
turning
our
prisoners
out
of
gates
bid
them
run
for
their
lives
which
they
did
fast
enough
not
knowing
our
numbers
and
our
men
sent
a
few
flights
of
arrows
among
them
that
they
might
not
be
undeceived
then
the
one
or
two
prisoners
that
we
had
left
told
us
when
we
had
crossed
our
axes
over
their
heads
that
the
people
of
the
good
town
would
not
willingly
fight
us
in
that
they
hated
the
queen
that
she
was
guarded
at
the
palace
by
some
fifty
knights
and
that
beside
there
were
no
others
to
oppose
us
in
the
town
so
we
set
out
for
the
palace
spear
in
hand
we
had
not
gone
far
before
we
heard
some
knights
coming
and
soon
in
a
turn
of
the
long
street
we
saw
them
riding
towards
us
when
they
caught
sight
of
us
they
seemed
astonished
drew
rein
and
stood
in
some
confusion
we
did
not
slacken
our
pace
for
an
instant
but
rode
right
at
them
with
a
yell
to
which
i
lent
myself
with
all
my
heart
after
all
they
did
not
run
away
but
waited
for
us
with
their
spears
held
out
i
missed
the
man
i
had
marked
or
hit
him
rather
just
on
the
top
of
the
helm
he
bent
back
and
the
spear
slipped
over
his
head
but
my
horse
still
kept
on
and
i
felt
presently
such
a
crash
that
i
reeled
in
my
saddle
and
felt
mad
he
had
lashed
out
at
me
with
his
sword
as
i
came
on
hitting
me
in
the
ribs
for
my
arm
was
raised
but
only
flatlings
i
was
quite
wild
with
rage
i
turned
almost
fell
upon
him
caught
him
by
the
neck
with
both
hands
and
threw
him
under
the
sighing
with
fury
i
heard
arnald
voice
close
to
me
well
fought
florian
and
i
saw
his
great
stern
face
bare
among
the
iron
for
he
had
made
a
vow
in
remembrance
of
that
blow
always
to
fight
unhelmed
i
saw
his
great
sword
swinging
in
wide
gyres
and
hissing
as
it
started
up
just
as
if
it
were
alive
and
liked
it
so
joy
filled
all
my
soul
and
i
fought
with
my
heart
till
the
big
axe
i
swung
felt
like
nothing
but
a
little
hammer
in
my
hand
except
for
its
bitterness
and
as
for
the
enemy
they
went
down
like
grass
so
that
we
destroyed
them
utterly
for
those
knights
would
neither
yield
nor
fly
but
died
as
they
stood
so
that
some
fifteen
of
our
men
also
died
there
then
at
last
we
came
to
the
palace
where
some
grooms
and
such
like
kept
the
gates
armed
but
some
ran
and
some
we
took
prisoners
one
of
whom
died
for
sheer
terror
in
our
hands
being
stricken
by
no
wound
for
he
thought
we
would
eat
him
these
prisoners
we
questioned
concerning
the
queen
and
so
entered
the
great
hall
there
arnald
sat
down
in
the
throne
on
the
dais
and
laid
his
naked
sword
before
him
on
the
table
and
on
each
side
of
him
sat
such
knights
as
there
was
room
for
and
the
others
stood
round
about
while
i
took
ten
men
and
went
to
look
for
swanhilda
i
found
her
soon
sitting
by
herself
in
a
gorgeous
chamber
i
almost
pitied
her
when
i
saw
her
looking
so
utterly
desolate
and
despairing
her
beauty
too
had
faded
deep
lines
cut
through
her
face
but
when
i
entered
she
knew
who
i
was
and
her
look
of
intense
hatred
was
so
that
it
changed
my
pity
into
horror
of
her
knight
she
said
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
thus
discourteously
entering
my
chamber
i
am
florian
de
liliis
and
i
am
to
conduct
you
to
judgment
she
sprang
up
curse
you
and
your
whole
house
you
i
hate
worse
than
any
girl
face
guards
guards
and
she
stamped
on
the
ground
her
veins
on
the
forehead
swelled
her
eyes
grew
round
and
flamed
out
as
she
kept
crying
for
her
guards
stamping
the
while
for
she
seemed
quite
mad
then
at
last
she
remembered
that
she
was
in
the
power
of
her
enemies
she
sat
down
and
lay
with
her
face
between
her
hands
and
wept
passionately
witch
i
said
between
my
closed
teeth
will
you
come
or
must
we
carry
you
down
to
the
great
hall
neither
would
she
come
but
sat
there
clutching
at
her
dress
and
tearing
her
hair
then
i
said
bind
her
and
carry
her
down
and
they
did
so
i
watched
arnald
as
we
came
in
there
was
no
triumph
on
his
stern
white
face
but
resolution
enough
he
had
made
up
his
mind
they
placed
her
on
a
seat
in
the
midst
of
the
hall
over
against
the
dais
he
said
unbind
her
florian
they
did
so
she
raised
her
face
and
glared
defiance
at
us
all
as
though
she
would
die
queenly
after
all
then
rose
up
arnald
and
said
queen
swanhilda
we
judge
you
guilty
of
death
and
because
you
are
a
queen
and
of
a
noble
house
you
shall
be
slain
by
my
knightly
sword
and
i
will
even
take
the
reproach
of
slaying
a
woman
for
no
other
hand
than
mine
shall
deal
the
blow
then
she
said
false
knight
show
your
warrant
from
god
man
or
devil
this
warrant
from
god
swanhilda
he
said
holding
up
his
sword
listen
fifteen
years
ago
when
i
was
just
winning
my
spurs
you
struck
me
disgracing
me
before
all
the
people
you
cursed
me
and
mean
that
curse
well
enough
men
of
the
house
of
the
lilies
what
sentence
for
that
death
they
said
listen
afterwards
you
slew
my
cousin
your
husband
treacherously
in
the
most
cursed
way
stabbing
him
in
the
throat
as
the
stars
in
the
canopy
above
him
looked
down
on
the
shut
eyes
of
him
men
of
the
house
of
lily
what
sentence
for
that
death
they
said
do
you
hear
them
queen
there
is
warrant
from
man
for
the
devil
i
do
not
reverence
him
enough
to
take
warrant
from
him
but
as
i
look
at
that
face
of
yours
i
think
that
even
he
has
left
you
and
indeed
just
then
all
her
pride
seemed
to
leave
her
she
fell
from
the
chair
and
wallowed
on
the
ground
moaning
she
wept
like
a
child
so
that
the
tears
lay
on
the
oak
floor
she
prayed
for
another
month
of
life
she
came
to
me
and
kneeled
and
kissed
my
feet
and
prayed
piteously
so
that
water
ran
out
of
her
mouth
but
i
shuddered
and
drew
away
it
was
like
hav
ing
an
adder
about
one
i
cou
have
pitied
her
had
she
died
bravely
but
for
one
like
her
to
whine
and
whine
pah
then
from
the
dais
rang
amald
voice
terrible
much
changed
let
there
be
an
end
of
all
this
and
he
took
his
sword
and
strode
through
the
hall
towards
her
she
rose
from
the
ground
and
stood
up
stooping
a
little
her
head
sunk
between
her
shoulders
her
black
eyes
turned
up
and
gloaming
like
a
tigress
about
to
spring
when
he
came
within
some
six
paces
of
her
something
in
his
eye
daunted
her
or
perhaps
the
flashing
of
his
terrible
sword
in
the
she
threw
her
arms
up
with
a
great
shriek
and
dashed
screaming
about
the
hall
lip
never
once
curled
with
any
scorn
no
line
in
his
face
changed
he
said
bring
her
here
and
bind
her
but
when
one
came
up
to
her
to
lay
hold
on
her
she
first
of
all
ran
at
him
hitting
with
her
head
in
the
belly
then
while
he
stood
doubled
up
for
want
of
breath
and
staring
with
his
head
up
she
caught
his
sword
from
the
girdle
and
cut
him
across
the
shoulders
and
many
others
she
wounded
sorely
before
they
took
her
then
arnald
stood
by
the
chair
to
which
she
was
bound
and
poised
his
sword
and
there
was
a
great
silence
then
he
said
men
of
the
house
of
the
lilies
do
you
justify
me
in
this
shall
she
die
straightway
rang
a
great
shout
through
the
hall
but
before
it
died
away
the
sword
had
swept
round
and
therewithal
was
there
no
such
thing
as
swanhilda
left
upon
the
earth
for
in
no
had
arnald
struck
truer
blow
then
he
turned
to
the
few
servants
of
the
palace
and
said
go
now
bury
this
accursed
woman
for
she
is
a
king
daughter
then
to
us
all
now
knights
to
horse
and
away
that
we
may
reach
the
good
town
by
about
dawn
so
we
mounted
and
rode
off
what
a
strange
that
was
for
there
about
nine
in
the
morning
rode
red
harald
into
the
good
town
to
demand
vengeance
he
went
at
once
to
the
king
and
the
king
promised
that
before
nightfall
that
very
day
the
matter
should
be
judged
albeit
the
king
feared
somewhat
because
every
third
man
you
met
in
the
streets
had
a
blue
cross
on
his
shoulder
and
some
likeness
of
a
lily
cut
out
or
painted
stuck
in
his
hat
and
this
blue
cross
and
lily
were
the
bearings
of
our
house
called
de
liliis
now
we
had
seen
red
harald
pass
through
the
streets
with
a
white
banner
borne
before
him
to
show
that
he
came
peaceably
as
for
this
time
but
i
know
he
was
thinking
of
other
things
than
peace
and
he
was
called
red
harald
first
at
this
time
because
over
all
his
arms
he
wore
a
great
scarlet
cloth
that
fell
in
heavy
folds
about
his
horse
and
all
about
him
then
as
he
passed
our
house
some
one
pointed
it
out
to
him
rising
there
with
its
carving
and
its
barred
marble
but
stronger
than
many
a
castle
on
the
and
its
great
overhanging
battlement
cast
a
mighty
shadow
down
the
wall
and
across
the
street
and
above
all
rose
the
great
tower
or
banner
floating
proudly
from
the
top
whereon
was
emblazoned
on
a
white
ground
a
blue
cross
and
on
a
blue
ground
four
white
lilies
and
now
faces
were
gazing
from
all
the
windows
and
all
the
battlements
were
thronged
so
harald
turned
and
rising
in
his
stirrups
shook
his
clenched
fist
at
our
house
natheless
as
he
did
so
the
east
wind
coming
down
the
street
caught
up
the
corner
of
that
scarlet
cloth
and
drove
it
over
his
face
and
therewithal
disordering
his
long
black
hair
well
nigh
choked
him
so
that
he
bit
both
his
hair
and
that
cloth
so
from
base
to
cope
rose
a
mighty
shout
of
triumph
and
defiance
and
he
passed
on
then
arnald
caused
it
to
be
cried
that
all
those
who
loved
the
good
house
of
the
lilies
should
go
to
mass
that
morning
in
saint
church
hard
by
our
house
now
this
church
belonged
to
us
and
the
abbey
that
served
it
and
always
we
appointed
the
abbot
of
it
on
condition
that
our
trumpets
should
sound
all
together
when
on
high
masses
they
sing
the
gloria
in
excelsis
it
was
the
largest
and
most
beautiful
of
all
the
churches
in
the
town
and
had
two
exceeding
high
towers
which
you
could
see
from
far
off
even
when
you
saw
not
the
town
or
any
of
its
other
towers
and
in
one
of
these
towers
were
twelve
great
bells
named
after
the
twelve
apostles
one
name
being
written
on
each
one
of
them
as
peter
matthew
and
so
on
and
in
the
other
tower
was
one
great
bell
only
much
larger
than
any
of
the
others
and
which
was
called
mary
now
this
bell
was
never
rung
but
when
our
house
was
in
great
danger
and
it
had
this
legend
on
it
when
mary
rings
the
earth
shakes
and
indeed
from
this
we
took
our
war
cry
which
was
mary
rings
somewhat
justifiable
indeed
for
the
last
time
that
mary
rang
on
that
day
before
nightfall
there
were
four
thousand
bodies
to
be
buried
which
bodies
wore
neither
cross
nor
lily
so
arnald
gave
me
in
charge
to
tell
the
abbot
to
cause
mary
to
be
tolled
for
an
hour
before
mass
that
day
the
abbot
leaned
on
my
shoulder
as
i
stood
within
the
tower
and
looked
at
the
twelve
monks
laying
their
hands
to
the
ropes
far
up
in
the
dimness
i
saw
the
wheel
before
it
began
to
swing
round
about
then
it
moved
a
little
the
twelve
men
bent
down
to
the
earth
and
a
roar
rose
that
shook
the
tower
from
base
to
spirevane
backwards
and
forwards
swept
the
wheel
as
mary
now
looked
downwards
towards
earth
now
looked
up
at
the
shadowy
cone
of
the
spire
shot
across
by
bars
of
light
from
the
dormers
and
the
thunder
of
mary
was
caught
up
by
the
wind
and
carried
through
all
the
country
and
when
the
good
man
heard
it
he
said
goodbye
to
wife
and
child
slung
his
shield
behind
his
back
and
set
forward
with
his
spear
sloped
over
his
shoulder
and
many
a
time
as
he
walked
toward
the
good
town
he
tightened
the
belt
that
went
about
his
waist
that
he
might
stride
the
faster
so
long
and
furiously
did
mary
toll
and
before
the
great
bell
mary
had
ceased
ringing
all
the
ways
were
full
of
armed
men
but
at
each
door
of
the
church
of
saint
mary
stood
a
row
of
men
armed
with
axes
and
when
any
came
meaning
to
go
into
the
church
the
two
first
of
these
would
hold
their
axes
whose
helves
were
about
four
feet
long
over
his
head
and
would
ask
him
who
went
over
the
moon
last
night
then
if
he
answered
nothing
or
at
random
they
would
bid
him
turn
back
which
he
for
the
more
part
would
be
ready
enough
to
do
but
some
striving
to
get
through
that
row
of
men
were
slain
outright
but
if
he
were
one
of
those
that
were
friends
to
the
house
of
the
lilies
he
would
answer
to
that
question
mary
and
john
by
the
time
the
mass
began
the
whole
church
was
full
and
in
the
nave
and
transept
thereof
were
three
thousand
men
all
of
our
house
and
all
armed
but
arnald
and
myself
and
squire
hugh
and
some
others
sat
under
a
canopy
near
the
choir
and
the
abbot
said
mass
having
his
mitre
on
his
head
yet
as
i
watched
him
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
must
have
something
on
beneath
his
priest
vestments
for
he
looked
much
fatter
than
usual
being
really
a
tall
lithe
man
now
as
they
sung
the
kyrie
some
one
shouted
from
the
other
end
of
the
church
my
lord
arnld
they
are
slaying
our
people
without
for
indeed
all
the
square
about
the
church
was
full
of
our
people
who
for
the
press
had
not
been
able
to
enter
and
were
standing
there
in
no
small
dread
of
what
might
come
to
pass
then
the
abbot
turned
round
from
the
altar
and
began
to
fidget
with
the
fastenings
of
his
rich
robes
and
they
made
a
lane
for
us
up
to
the
west
door
then
i
put
on
my
helm
and
we
began
to
go
up
the
nave
then
suddenly
the
singing
of
the
monks
and
all
stopped
i
heard
a
clinking
and
a
buzz
of
voices
in
the
choir
i
turned
and
saw
that
the
bright
noon
sun
was
shining
on
the
gold
of
the
priest
vestments
as
they
lay
on
the
floor
and
on
the
mail
that
the
priests
carried
so
we
stopped
the
choir
gates
swung
open
and
the
abbot
marched
out
at
the
head
of
his
men
all
fully
armed
and
began
to
strike
up
the
psalm
exsurgat
deus
when
we
got
to
the
west
door
there
was
indeed
a
tumult
but
as
yet
no
slaying
the
square
was
all
with
steel
and
we
beheld
a
great
body
of
knights
at
the
head
of
them
red
harald
and
the
king
standing
over
against
us
but
our
people
pressed
against
the
houses
and
into
the
comers
of
the
square
were
some
striving
to
enter
the
doors
some
beside
themselves
with
rage
shouting
out
to
the
others
to
charge
withal
some
were
pale
and
some
were
red
with
the
blood
that
had
gathered
to
the
wrathful
faces
of
them
then
said
arnald
to
those
about
him
lift
me
up
so
they
laid
a
great
shield
on
two
lances
and
these
four
men
carried
and
thereon
stood
arnald
and
gazed
about
him
now
the
king
was
unhelmed
and
his
white
hair
for
he
was
an
old
man
flowed
down
behind
him
on
to
his
saddle
but
amaid
hair
was
cut
short
and
was
red
and
all
the
bells
rang
then
the
king
said
arnald
of
the
lilies
will
you
settle
this
quarrel
by
the
judgment
of
god
and
amaid
thrust
up
his
chin
and
said
yea
how
then
said
the
king
and
where
will
it
please
you
try
now
said
arnald
then
the
king
understood
what
he
meant
and
took
in
his
hand
from
behind
tresses
of
his
long
white
hair
twisting
them
round
his
hand
in
his
wrath
but
yet
said
no
word
till
i
suppose
his
hair
put
him
in
mind
of
something
and
he
raised
it
in
both
his
hands
above
his
head
and
shouted
out
aloud
knights
hearken
to
this
traitor
whereat
indeed
the
lances
began
to
move
ominously
but
arnald
spoke
you
king
and
lords
what
have
we
to
do
with
you
were
we
not
free
in
the
old
time
up
among
the
hills
there
wherefore
give
way
and
we
will
go
to
the
hills
again
and
if
any
man
try
to
stop
us
his
blood
be
on
his
own
head
wherefore
now
and
he
turned
all
you
house
of
the
lily
both
soldiers
and
monks
let
us
go
forth
together
fearing
nothing
for
i
think
there
is
not
bone
enough
or
muscle
enough
in
these
fellows
here
that
have
a
king
that
they
should
stop
us
withal
but
only
skin
and
fat
and
truly
no
man
dared
to
stop
us
and
we
went
failing
in
the
world
now
at
that
time
we
drove
cattle
in
red
harald
land
and
we
took
no
hoof
but
from
the
lords
and
rich
men
but
of
these
we
had
a
mighty
drove
both
oxen
and
sheep
and
horses
and
besides
even
hawks
and
hounds
and
huntsman
or
two
to
take
care
of
them
and
about
noon
we
drew
away
from
the
cornlands
that
lay
beyond
the
pastures
and
mingled
with
them
and
reached
a
wide
moor
which
was
called
goliath
land
i
scarce
know
why
except
that
it
belonged
neither
to
red
harald
or
us
but
was
debatable
and
the
cattle
began
to
go
slowly
and
our
horses
were
tired
and
the
sun
struck
down
very
hot
upon
us
for
there
was
no
shadow
and
the
day
was
cloudless
all
about
the
edge
of
the
moor
except
on
the
sidefrom
which
we
had
come
was
a
rim
of
hills
not
very
high
but
very
rocky
and
steep
otherwise
the
moor
itself
was
flat
and
through
these
hills
was
one
pass
guarded
by
our
men
which
pass
led
to
the
hill
castle
of
the
lilies
it
was
not
wonderful
that
of
this
moor
many
wild
stories
were
told
being
such
a
strange
lonely
place
some
of
them
one
knew
alas
to
be
over
true
in
the
old
time
before
we
went
to
the
good
town
this
moor
had
been
the
mustering
place
of
our
people
and
our
house
had
done
deeds
enough
of
blood
and
horror
to
turn
our
white
lilies
red
and
our
blue
cross
to
a
fiery
one
but
some
of
those
wild
tales
i
never
believed
they
had
to
do
mostly
with
men
losing
their
way
without
any
apparent
cause
for
there
were
plenty
of
landmarks
finding
some
spot
and
then
just
beyond
it
a
place
they
had
never
even
dreamed
of
florian
fiorian
said
arnald
for
god
sake
stop
as
every
one
else
is
stopping
to
look
at
the
hills
yonder
i
always
thought
there
was
a
curse
upon
us
what
does
god
mean
by
shutting
us
up
here
look
at
the
cattle
christ
they
have
found
it
out
too
see
some
of
them
are
turning
to
run
back
again
towards
harald
land
oh
unhappy
unhappy
from
that
day
forward
he
leaned
forward
rested
his
head
on
his
horse
neck
and
wept
like
a
child
i
felt
so
irritated
with
him
that
i
could
almost
have
slain
him
then
and
there
was
he
mad
had
these
wild
doings
of
ours
turned
his
strong
wise
head
are
you
my
brother
arnald
that
i
used
to
think
such
a
grand
man
when
i
was
a
boy
i
said
or
are
you
changed
too
like
everybody
and
everything
else
what
do
you
mean
look
look
he
said
grinding
his
teeth
in
agony
i
raised
my
eyes
where
was
the
one
pass
between
the
rim
of
stern
rocks
nothing
the
enemy
behind
that
grim
wall
in
front
what
wonder
that
each
man
looked
in
his
fellow
face
for
help
and
found
it
not
yet
i
refused
to
believe
that
there
was
any
troth
either
in
the
wild
stories
that
i
had
heard
when
i
was
a
boy
or
in
this
story
told
me
so
clearly
by
my
eyes
now
i
called
out
cheerily
hugh
come
here
he
came
what
do
you
think
of
this
some
mere
dodge
on
harald
part
are
we
cut
off
think
sir
florian
god
forgive
me
for
ever
thinking
at
all
i
have
given
up
that
long
and
long
ago
because
thirty
years
ago
i
thought
this
that
the
house
of
lilies
would
deserve
anything
in
the
way
of
bad
fortune
that
god
would
send
them
so
i
gave
up
thinking
and
took
to
fighting
but
if
you
think
that
harald
had
anything
to
do
with
this
god
name
i
wish
i
could
think
so
i
felt
a
dull
weight
on
my
heart
had
our
house
been
the
servants
all
along
i
thought
we
were
god
servants
the
day
was
very
still
but
what
little
wind
there
was
was
at
our
backs
i
watched
hugh
face
not
being
able
to
answer
him
he
was
the
cleverest
man
at
war
that
i
have
known
either
before
or
since
that
day
sharper
than
any
hound
in
ear
and
scent
clearer
sighted
than
any
eagle
he
was
listening
now
intently
i
saw
a
slight
smile
cross
his
face
heard
him
mutter
yes
i
think
so
verily
that
is
better
a
great
deal
better
then
he
stood
up
in
his
stirrups
and
shouted
hurrah
for
the
lilies
mary
rings
mary
rings
i
shouted
though
i
did
not
know
the
reason
for
his
exultation
my
brother
lifted
his
head
and
smiled
too
grimly
then
as
i
listened
i
heard
clearly
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
and
enemy
trumpet
too
after
all
it
was
only
mist
or
some
such
thing
i
said
for
the
pass
between
the
hills
was
clear
enough
now
hurrah
only
mist
said
amald
quite
elated
mary
rings
and
we
all
began
to
think
of
fighting
for
after
all
what
joy
is
equal
to
that
there
were
five
hundred
of
us
two
hundred
spears
the
rest
archers
and
both
archers
and
men
at
arms
were
picked
men
how
many
of
them
are
we
to
expect
said
i
not
under
a
thousand
certainly
probably
more
sir
florian
my
brother
arnald
by
the
way
had
knighted
me
before
we
left
the
good
town
and
hugh
liked
to
give
me
the
handle
to
my
name
how
was
it
by
the
way
that
no
one
had
ever
made
him
a
knight
let
every
one
look
to
his
arms
and
horse
and
come
away
from
these
silly
cows
sons
shouted
arnald
hugh
said
they
will
be
here
in
an
hour
fair
sir
so
we
got
clear
of
the
cattle
and
dismounted
and
both
ourselves
took
food
and
drink
and
our
horses
afterwards
we
tightened
our
shook
our
great
pots
of
helmets
on
except
amald
whose
rustyred
hair
had
been
his
only
in
battle
for
years
and
years
and
stood
with
our
spears
close
by
our
horses
leaving
room
for
the
archers
to
retreat
between
our
ranks
and
they
got
their
arrows
ready
and
planted
their
stakes
before
a
little
peat
moss
and
there
we
waited
and
saw
their
pennons
at
last
floating
high
above
the
corn
of
the
fertile
land
then
heard
their
many
ring
upon
the
moor
and
the
archers
began
to
shoot
it
had
been
a
strange
battle
we
had
never
fought
better
and
yet
withal
it
had
ended
in
a
retreat
indeed
all
along
every
man
but
arnald
and
myself
even
hugh
had
been
trying
at
least
to
get
the
enemy
between
him
and
the
way
toward
the
pass
and
now
we
were
all
drifting
that
way
the
enemy
trying
to
cut
us
off
but
never
able
to
stop
us
because
he
could
only
throw
small
bodies
of
men
in
our
way
whom
we
scattered
and
put
to
flight
in
their
turn
i
never
cared
less
for
my
life
than
then
indeed
in
spite
of
all
my
boasting
and
hardness
of
belief
i
should
have
been
happy
to
have
died
such
a
strange
weight
of
apprehension
was
on
me
and
yet
i
got
no
scratch
even
i
had
soon
put
off
my
great
helm
and
was
fighting
in
my
only
and
here
i
swear
that
three
knights
together
charged
me
aiming
at
my
bare
face
yet
never
touched
me
for
as
for
one
i
put
his
lance
aside
with
my
sword
and
the
other
two
in
some
most
wonderful
manner
got
their
spears
locked
in
each
other
armour
and
so
had
to
submit
to
be
knocked
off
their
horses
and
we
still
neared
the
pass
and
began
to
see
distinctly
the
ferns
that
grew
on
the
rocks
and
the
fair
country
between
the
rift
in
them
spreading
out
there
whereupon
came
a
great
rush
of
men
of
both
sides
striking
side
blows
at
each
other
spitting
cursing
and
shrieking
as
they
tore
away
like
a
herd
of
wild
hogs
so
being
careless
of
lfe
as
i
said
i
drew
rein
and
turning
my
horse
waited
quietly
for
them
and
i
knotted
the
reins
and
laid
them
on
the
horse
neck
and
stroked
him
that
he
whinnied
then
got
both
my
hands
to
my
sword
then
as
they
came
on
i
noted
hurriedly
that
the
first
man
was
one
of
arnald
men
and
one
of
our
men
behind
him
leaned
forward
to
prod
him
with
his
spear
but
could
not
reach
so
far
till
he
himself
was
run
through
the
eye
with
a
spear
and
throwing
his
arms
up
fell
dead
with
a
shriek
also
i
noted
concerning
this
first
man
that
the
laces
of
his
helmet
were
loose
and
when
he
saw
me
he
lifted
his
left
hand
to
his
head
took
off
his
helm
and
cast
it
at
me
and
still
tore
on
the
helmet
flew
over
my
head
and
i
sitting
still
there
swung
out
hitting
him
on
the
neck
his
head
flew
right
off
for
the
mail
no
more
held
than
a
piece
of
silk
mary
rings
and
my
horse
whinnied
again
and
we
both
of
us
went
at
it
and
fairly
stopped
that
rout
so
that
there
was
a
knot
of
quite
close
and
desperate
fighting
wherein
we
had
the
best
of
that
fight
and
slew
most
of
them
albeit
my
horse
was
slain
and
my
cut
through
then
i
bade
a
squire
fetch
me
another
horse
and
began
meanwhile
to
upbraid
those
knights
for
running
in
such
a
strange
disorderly
race
instead
of
standing
and
fighting
cleverly
moreover
we
had
drifted
even
in
this
successful
fight
still
nearer
to
the
pass
so
that
the
conies
who
dwelt
there
were
beginning
to
consider
whether
they
should
not
run
into
their
holes
but
one
of
those
knights
said
be
not
angry
with
me
sir
florian
but
do
you
think
you
will
go
to
heaven
the
saints
i
hope
so
i
said
but
one
who
stood
near
him
whispered
to
him
to
hold
his
peace
so
i
cried
out
friend
i
hold
this
world
and
all
therein
so
cheap
now
that
i
see
not
anything
in
it
but
shame
which
can
any
longer
anger
me
wherefore
speak
out
then
sir
florian
men
say
that
at
your
christening
some
fiend
took
on
him
the
likeness
of
a
priest
and
strove
to
baptize
you
in
the
devil
name
but
god
had
mercy
on
you
so
that
the
fiend
could
not
choose
but
baptize
you
in
the
name
of
the
most
holy
trinity
and
yet
men
say
that
you
hardly
believe
any
doctrine
such
as
other
men
do
and
will
at
the
end
only
go
to
heaven
round
about
as
it
were
not
at
all
by
the
intercession
of
our
lady
they
say
too
that
you
can
see
no
ghosts
or
other
wonders
whatever
happens
to
other
christian
men
i
smiled
well
friend
i
scarcely
call
this
a
disadvantage
moreover
what
has
it
to
do
with
the
matter
in
hand
how
was
this
in
heaven
name
we
had
been
quite
still
resting
while
this
talk
was
going
on
but
we
could
hear
the
hawks
chattering
from
the
rocks
we
were
so
close
now
and
my
heart
sunk
within
me
there
was
no
reason
why
this
should
not
be
true
there
was
no
reason
why
anything
should
not
be
true
this
sir
florian
said
the
knight
again
how
would
you
feel
inclined
to
fight
if
you
thought
that
everything
about
you
was
mere
glamour
this
earth
here
the
rocks
the
sun
the
sky
i
do
not
know
where
i
am
for
certain
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
not
midnight
instead
of
undem
i
do
not
know
if
i
have
been
fighting
men
or
only
simulacra
but
i
think
we
all
think
that
we
have
been
led
into
some
trap
or
other
and
may
god
forgive
me
my
sins
i
wish
i
had
never
been
born
there
now
he
was
weeping
they
all
wept
how
strange
it
was
to
see
those
rough
bearded
men
blubbering
there
and
snivelling
till
the
tears
ran
over
their
armour
and
mingled
with
the
blood
so
that
it
dropped
down
to
the
earth
in
a
dim
dull
red
rain
my
eyes
indeed
were
dry
but
then
so
was
my
heart
i
felt
far
worse
than
weeping
came
to
but
nevertheless
i
spoke
cheerily
dear
friends
where
are
your
old
men
hearts
gone
to
now
see
now
this
is
a
punishment
for
our
sins
is
it
well
for
our
sins
or
our
own
if
the
first
brothers
be
very
sure
that
if
we
bear
it
manfully
god
will
have
something
very
good
in
store
for
us
hereafter
but
if
for
our
sins
is
it
not
certain
that
he
cares
for
us
yet
for
note
that
he
suffers
the
wicked
to
go
their
own
ways
pretty
much
moreover
brave
men
brothers
ought
to
be
the
masters
of
simulacra
come
is
it
so
hard
to
die
once
for
all
still
no
answer
came
from
them
they
sighed
heavily
only
i
heard
the
sound
of
more
than
one
or
two
swords
as
they
rattled
back
to
the
scabbards
nay
one
knight
stripping
himself
of
surcoat
and
hauberk
and
drawing
his
dagger
looked
at
me
with
a
grim
smile
and
said
sir
florian
do
so
then
he
drew
the
dagger
across
his
throat
and
he
fell
back
dead
they
shuddered
those
brave
men
and
crossed
themselves
and
i
had
no
heart
to
say
a
word
more
but
mounted
the
horse
which
had
been
brought
to
me
and
rode
away
slowly
for
a
few
yards
then
i
became
aware
that
there
was
a
great
silence
over
the
whole
field
so
i
lifted
my
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
no
man
struck
at
another
then
from
out
of
a
band
of
horsemen
came
harald
and
he
was
covered
all
over
with
a
great
scarlet
cloth
as
before
put
on
over
the
head
and
flowing
all
about
his
horse
but
rent
with
the
fight
he
put
off
his
helm
and
drew
back
his
then
took
a
trumpet
from
the
hand
of
a
herald
and
blew
strongly
and
in
the
midst
of
his
blast
i
heard
a
voice
call
out
florian
come
and
speak
to
me
for
the
last
time
so
when
i
turned
i
beheld
arnald
standing
by
himself
but
near
him
stood
hugh
and
ten
others
with
drawn
swords
then
i
wept
and
so
went
to
him
weeping
and
he
said
thou
seest
brother
that
we
must
die
and
i
think
by
some
horrible
and
death
and
the
house
of
the
lilies
is
just
dying
too
and
now
i
repent
me
of
swanhilda
death
now
i
know
that
it
was
a
poor
cowardly
piece
of
revenge
instead
of
a
brave
act
of
justice
thus
has
god
shown
us
the
right
florian
curse
me
so
will
it
be
straighter
truly
thy
mother
when
she
bore
thee
did
not
think
of
this
rather
saw
thee
in
the
tourney
at
this
time
in
her
fond
hopes
glittering
with
gold
and
doing
knightly
or
else
mingling
thy
brown
locks
with
the
golden
hair
of
some
maiden
weeping
for
the
love
of
thee
god
forgive
me
god
forgive
me
what
harm
brother
i
said
this
is
only
failing
in
the
world
what
if
we
had
not
failed
in
a
little
while
it
would
have
made
no
difference
truly
just
now
i
felt
very
miserable
but
now
it
has
passed
away
and
i
am
happy
brave
heart
he
said
yet
we
shall
part
just
now
florian
farewell
the
road
is
long
i
said
farewell
then
we
kissed
each
other
and
hugh
and
the
others
wept
now
all
this
time
the
trumpets
had
been
ringing
ringing
great
doleful
peals
then
they
ceased
and
above
all
sounded
red
voice
so
i
looked
round
towards
that
pass
and
when
i
looked
i
no
longer
doubted
any
of
those
wild
tales
of
glamour
concerning
goliath
land
and
for
though
the
rocks
were
the
same
and
though
the
conies
still
stood
gazing
at
the
doors
of
their
dwellings
though
the
hawks
still
cried
out
shrilly
though
the
fern
still
shook
in
the
wind
yet
beyond
oh
such
a
land
not
to
be
described
by
any
because
of
its
great
beauty
lying
a
great
hollow
land
the
rocks
going
down
on
this
side
in
precipices
then
reaches
and
reaches
of
loveliest
country
trees
and
flowers
and
corn
then
the
hills
green
and
blue
and
purple
till
their
ledges
reached
the
white
snowy
mountains
at
last
then
with
all
manner
of
strange
feelings
my
heart
in
the
midst
of
my
body
was
even
like
melting
wax
you
house
of
the
lily
you
are
conquered
yet
i
will
take
vengeance
only
on
a
few
therefore
let
all
those
who
wish
to
live
come
and
pile
their
swords
and
shields
and
helms
behind
me
in
three
great
heaps
and
swear
fealty
afterwards
to
me
yes
all
but
the
false
knights
arnald
and
florian
we
were
holding
each
other
hands
and
gazing
and
we
saw
all
our
knights
yea
all
but
squire
hugh
and
his
ten
heroes
pass
over
the
field
singly
or
in
groups
of
three
or
four
with
their
heads
hanging
down
in
shame
and
they
cast
down
their
notched
swords
and
dinted
lilied
shields
and
helms
into
three
great
heaps
behind
red
herald
then
stood
behind
no
man
speaking
to
his
fellow
or
touching
him
then
dolefully
the
great
trumpets
sang
over
the
dying
house
of
the
lily
and
red
harald
led
his
men
forward
but
slowly
on
they
came
spear
and
mail
glittering
in
the
sunlight
and
i
turned
and
looked
at
that
good
land
and
a
shuddering
delight
seized
my
soul
but
i
felt
my
brother
hand
leave
mine
and
saw
him
turn
his
head
and
ride
swiftly
toward
the
pass
that
was
a
strange
pass
now
and
at
the
edge
he
stopped
turned
round
and
called
out
aloud
i
pray
thee
harald
forgive
mel
now
farewell
all
then
the
horse
gave
one
bound
forward
and
we
heard
the
poor
creature
scream
when
he
felt
that
he
must
die
and
we
heard
afterwards
for
we
were
near
enough
for
that
even
a
clang
and
a
crash
so
i
turned
me
about
to
hugh
and
he
understood
me
though
i
could
not
speak
we
shouted
all
together
mary
rings
then
laid
our
bridles
on
the
necks
of
our
horses
spurred
forward
and
in
five
minutes
they
were
all
slain
and
i
was
down
among
the
not
slain
though
not
wounded
red
harald
smiled
grimly
when
he
saw
me
rise
and
lash
out
again
he
and
some
ten
others
dismounted
and
holding
their
long
spears
out
i
went
back
back
back
i
saw
what
it
meant
and
sheathed
my
sword
and
their
laughter
rolled
all
about
me
and
i
too
smiled
presently
they
all
stopped
and
i
felt
the
last
foot
of
turf
giving
under
my
feet
i
looked
down
and
saw
the
crack
there
widening
then
in
a
moment
i
fell
and
a
cloud
of
dust
and
earth
rolled
after
me
then
again
their
mirth
rose
into
of
laughter
but
through
it
all
i
heard
red
harald
shout
silence
evil
dogs
for
as
i
fell
i
stretched
out
my
arms
and
caughl
a
tuft
of
yellow
broom
some
three
feet
from
the
brow
and
hung
there
by
the
hands
my
feet
being
loose
in
the
air
then
red
harald
came
and
stood
on
the
precipice
above
me
his
great
axe
over
his
shoulder
and
he
looked
down
on
me
not
ferociously
almost
kindly
while
the
wind
from
the
hollow
land
blew
about
his
red
raiment
tattered
and
dusty
now
and
i
felt
happy
though
it
pained
me
to
hold
straining
by
the
broom
yet
i
said
i
will
hold
out
to
the
last
it
was
not
long
the
plant
itself
gave
way
and
i
fell
and
as
i
fell
i
fainted
i
had
thought
when
i
fell
that
i
should
never
wake
again
but
i
woke
at
last
for
a
long
time
i
was
quite
dizzied
and
could
see
nothing
at
all
horrible
doubts
came
creeping
over
me
i
half
expected
to
see
presently
great
shapes
come
rolling
up
to
me
to
crush
me
some
thing
fiery
not
strange
too
utterly
horrible
to
be
strange
but
utterly
vile
and
ugly
the
sight
of
which
would
have
killed
me
when
i
was
upon
the
earth
come
rolling
up
to
torment
me
in
fact
i
doubted
if
i
were
in
hell
i
knew
i
deserved
to
be
but
i
prayed
and
then
it
came
into
my
mind
that
i
could
not
pray
if
i
were
in
hell
also
there
seemed
to
be
a
cool
green
light
all
about
me
which
was
sweet
then
presently
i
heard
a
glorious
voice
ring
outclear
close
to
me
christ
keep
the
hollow
land
through
the
sweet
when
the
bless
the
lowly
bent
hill
side
thereat
my
eyes
were
slowly
unsealed
and
i
saw
the
blessedest
sight
i
have
ever
seen
before
or
since
for
i
saw
my
love
she
sat
about
five
yards
from
me
on
a
great
grey
stone
that
had
much
moss
on
it
one
of
the
many
scattered
along
the
side
of
the
stream
by
which
i
lay
she
was
clad
in
loose
white
raiment
close
to
her
hands
and
throat
her
feet
were
bare
her
hair
hung
loose
a
long
way
down
but
some
of
it
lay
on
her
knees
i
said
white
raiment
but
long
spikes
of
light
scarlet
went
down
from
the
throat
lost
here
and
there
in
the
shadows
of
the
folds
and
growing
smaller
and
smaller
died
before
they
reached
her
feet
i
was
lying
with
my
head
resting
on
soft
moss
that
some
one
had
gathered
and
placed
under
me
she
when
she
saw
me
moving
and
awake
came
and
stood
over
me
with
a
gracious
smile
she
was
so
lovely
and
tender
to
look
at
and
so
kind
yet
withal
no
one
man
or
woman
had
ever
frightened
me
half
so
much
she
was
not
fair
in
white
and
red
like
many
beautiful
women
are
being
rather
pale
but
like
ivory
for
smoothness
and
her
hair
was
quite
golden
not
light
yellow
but
dusky
golden
i
tried
to
get
up
on
my
feet
but
was
too
weak
and
sank
back
again
she
said
no
not
just
yet
do
not
trouble
yourself
or
try
to
remember
anything
just
at
present
there
withal
she
kneeled
down
and
hung
over
me
closer
you
may
perhaps
have
something
hard
to
do
or
bear
i
know
but
now
you
must
be
as
happy
as
you
can
be
quietly
happy
why
did
you
start
and
turn
pale
when
i
came
to
you
do
you
not
know
who
i
am
nay
but
you
do
i
see
and
i
have
been
waiting
here
so
long
for
you
so
you
must
have
expected
to
see
me
you
can
not
be
frightened
of
me
are
you
but
i
could
not
answer
a
word
but
all
the
time
strange
knowledge
strange
feelings
were
filling
my
brain
and
my
heart
she
said
you
are
tired
rest
and
dream
happily
so
she
sat
by
me
and
sang
to
lull
me
to
sleep
while
i
turned
on
my
elbow
and
watched
the
waving
of
her
throat
and
the
singing
of
all
the
poets
i
had
ever
heard
and
of
many
others
too
not
born
till
years
long
after
i
was
dead
floated
all
about
me
as
she
sang
and
i
did
indeed
dream
happily
when
i
awoke
it
was
the
time
of
the
cold
dawn
and
the
colours
were
gathering
themselves
together
whereat
in
fatherly
approving
fashion
the
sun
sent
all
across
the
east
long
bars
of
scarlet
and
orange
that
after
faded
through
yellow
to
green
and
blue
and
she
sat
by
me
still
i
think
she
had
been
sitting
there
and
singing
all
the
time
all
through
hot
yesterday
for
i
had
been
sleeping
and
all
through
the
falling
evening
under
moonlight
and
starlight
the
night
through
and
now
it
was
dawn
and
i
think
too
that
neither
of
us
had
moved
at
all
for
the
last
thing
i
remembered
before
i
went
to
sleep
was
the
tips
of
her
fingers
brushing
my
cheek
as
she
knelt
over
me
with
downdrooping
arm
and
still
now
i
felt
them
there
moreover
she
was
just
finishing
some
fainting
measure
that
died
before
it
had
time
to
get
painful
in
its
passion
dear
lord
how
i
loved
her
yet
did
i
not
dare
to
touch
her
or
even
speak
to
her
she
smiled
with
delight
when
she
saw
i
was
awake
again
and
slid
down
her
hand
on
to
mine
but
some
shuddering
dread
made
me
draw
it
away
again
hurriedly
then
i
saw
the
smile
leave
her
face
what
would
i
not
have
given
for
courage
to
hold
her
body
quite
tight
to
mine
but
i
was
so
weak
she
said
have
you
been
very
happy
yea
i
said
it
was
the
first
word
i
had
spoken
there
and
my
voice
sounded
strange
ah
she
said
you
will
talk
more
when
you
get
used
to
the
air
of
the
hollow
land
have
you
been
thinking
of
your
past
life
at
all
if
not
try
to
think
of
it
what
thing
in
heaven
or
earth
do
you
wish
for
most
still
i
said
no
word
but
she
said
in
a
wearied
way
well
now
i
think
you
will
be
strong
enough
to
get
to
your
feet
and
walk
take
my
hand
and
try
therewith
she
held
it
out
i
strove
hard
to
be
brave
enough
to
take
it
but
could
not
i
only
turned
away
shuddering
sick
and
grieved
to
the
heart
core
of
me
then
struggling
hard
with
hand
and
knee
and
elbow
i
scarce
rose
and
stood
up
totteringly
while
she
watched
me
sadly
still
holding
out
her
hand
but
as
i
rose
in
my
swinging
to
and
fro
the
steel
sheath
of
my
sword
struck
her
on
the
hand
so
that
the
blood
flowed
from
it
which
she
stood
looking
at
for
a
while
then
dropped
it
downwards
and
turned
to
look
at
me
for
i
was
going
then
as
i
walked
she
followed
me
so
i
stopped
and
turned
and
said
almost
fiercely
i
am
going
alone
to
look
for
my
brother
the
vehemence
with
which
i
spoke
or
something
else
burst
some
within
my
throat
and
we
both
stood
there
with
the
blood
running
from
us
on
to
the
grass
and
summer
flowers
she
said
if
you
find
him
wait
with
him
till
i
come
yea
and
i
turned
and
left
her
following
the
course
of
the
stream
upwards
and
as
i
went
i
heard
her
low
singing
that
almost
broke
my
heart
for
its
sadness
and
i
went
painfully
because
of
my
weakness
and
because
also
of
the
great
stones
and
sometimes
i
went
along
a
spot
of
earth
where
the
river
had
been
used
to
flow
in
and
which
was
now
bare
of
everything
but
stones
and
the
sun
now
risen
high
poured
down
on
everything
a
great
flood
of
fierce
light
and
scorching
heat
and
burnt
me
sorely
so
that
i
almost
fainted
but
about
noontide
i
entered
a
wood
close
by
the
stream
a
intending
to
rest
myself
the
herbage
was
thin
and
scattered
there
sprouting
up
from
amid
the
and
nuts
of
the
beeches
which
had
fallen
year
after
year
on
that
same
spot
the
outside
boughs
swept
low
down
the
air
itself
seemed
green
when
you
entered
within
the
shadow
of
the
branches
they
the
place
so
with
tender
green
only
here
and
there
showing
spots
of
blue
but
what
lay
at
the
foot
of
a
great
beech
tree
but
some
dead
knight
in
armour
only
the
helmet
off
a
wolf
was
prowling
round
about
it
who
ran
away
snarling
when
he
saw
me
coming
so
i
went
up
to
that
dead
knight
and
fell
on
my
knees
before
him
laying
my
head
on
his
breast
for
it
was
arnald
he
was
quite
cold
but
had
not
been
dead
for
very
long
i
would
not
believe
him
dead
but
went
down
to
the
stream
and
brought
him
water
tried
to
make
him
would
you
he
was
as
dead
as
swanhilda
neither
came
there
any
answer
to
my
cries
that
afternoon
but
the
moaning
of
the
wood
doves
in
the
beeches
so
then
i
sat
down
and
took
his
head
on
my
knees
and
closed
the
eyes
and
wept
quietly
while
the
sun
sank
lower
but
a
little
after
sunset
i
heard
a
rustle
through
the
leaves
that
was
not
the
wind
and
looking
up
my
eyes
met
the
pitying
eyes
of
that
maiden
something
stirred
rebelliously
within
me
i
ceased
weeping
and
said
it
is
unjust
unfair
what
right
had
swanhilda
to
live
did
not
god
give
her
up
to
us
how
much
better
was
he
than
ten
swanhildas
and
look
you
see
he
is
dead
now
this
i
shrieked
out
being
mad
and
though
i
trembled
when
i
saw
some
stormy
wrath
that
vexed
her
very
heart
and
loving
lips
gathering
on
her
face
i
yet
sat
there
looking
at
her
and
screaming
screaming
till
all
the
place
rang
but
when
growing
hoarse
and
breathless
i
ceased
she
said
with
straitened
brow
and
scornful
mouth
so
bravely
done
must
i
then
though
i
am
a
woman
call
you
a
liar
for
saying
god
is
unjust
you
to
punish
her
had
not
god
then
punished
her
already
how
many
times
when
she
woke
in
the
dead
night
do
you
suppose
she
missed
seeing
king
urrayne
pale
face
and
hacked
head
lying
on
the
pillow
by
her
side
whether
by
night
or
day
what
things
but
screams
did
she
hear
when
the
wind
blew
loud
round
about
the
palace
corners
and
did
not
that
face
too
often
come
before
her
pale
and
bleeding
as
it
was
long
ago
and
gaze
at
her
from
unhappy
eyes
poor
eyesi
with
changed
purpose
in
no
more
hope
of
converting
the
world
when
that
blow
was
once
struck
truly
it
was
very
more
dreams
but
only
fierce
struggles
with
the
devil
for
very
life
no
more
dreams
but
failure
at
last
and
death
happier
so
in
the
hollow
land
she
grew
so
pitying
as
she
gazed
at
his
dead
face
that
i
began
to
weep
again
unreasonably
while
she
saw
not
that
i
was
weeping
but
looked
only
on
arnald
face
but
after
turned
on
me
frowning
unjust
yes
truly
unjust
enough
to
take
away
life
and
all
hope
from
her
you
have
done
a
base
cowardly
act
you
and
your
brother
here
disguise
it
as
you
may
you
deserve
all
god
judgment
you
but
i
turned
my
eyes
and
wet
face
to
her
and
said
do
not
curse
me
there
do
not
look
like
swanhilda
for
see
now
you
said
at
first
that
you
have
been
waiting
long
for
me
give
me
your
hand
now
for
i
love
you
so
then
she
came
and
knelt
by
where
i
sat
and
i
caught
her
in
my
arms
and
she
prayed
to
be
forgiven
florian
i
have
indeed
waited
long
for
you
and
when
i
saw
you
my
heart
was
filled
with
joy
but
you
would
neither
touch
me
nor
speak
to
me
so
that
i
became
almost
mad
forgive
me
we
will
be
so
happy
now
do
you
know
this
is
what
i
have
been
waiting
for
all
these
years
it
made
me
glad
i
know
when
i
was
a
little
baby
in
my
mother
arms
to
think
i
was
born
for
this
and
afterwards
as
i
grew
up
i
used
to
watch
every
breath
of
wind
through
the
every
turn
of
the
silver
poplar
leaves
thinking
it
might
be
you
or
some
news
of
you
then
i
rose
and
drew
her
up
with
me
but
she
knelt
again
by
my
brother
side
and
kissed
him
and
said
brother
the
hollow
land
is
only
second
best
of
the
places
god
has
made
for
heaven
also
is
the
work
of
his
hand
afterwards
we
dug
a
deep
grave
among
the
beechroots
and
there
we
buried
amald
de
liliis
and
i
have
never
seen
him
since
scarcely
even
in
dreams
surely
god
has
had
mercy
on
him
for
he
was
very
leal
and
true
and
brave
he
loved
many
men
and
was
kind
and
gentle
to
his
friends
neither
did
he
hate
any
but
swanhilda
but
as
for
us
two
margaret
and
me
i
can
not
tell
you
concerning
our
happiness
such
things
can
not
be
told
only
this
i
know
that
we
abode
continually
in
the
hollow
land
until
i
lost
it
moreover
this
i
can
tell
you
margaret
was
walking
with
me
as
she
often
walked
near
the
place
where
i
had
first
seen
her
presently
we
came
upon
a
woman
sitting
dressed
in
scarlet
and
gold
raiment
with
her
head
laid
down
on
her
knees
likewise
we
heard
her
sobbing
margaret
who
is
she
i
said
i
knew
not
that
any
dwelt
in
the
hollow
land
but
us
two
only
she
said
i
know
not
who
she
is
only
sometimes
these
many
years
i
have
seen
her
scarlet
robe
flaming
from
far
away
amid
the
quiet
green
grass
but
i
was
never
so
near
her
as
this
florian
i
am
afraid
let
us
come
away
fytte
the
second
such
a
horrible
grey
november
day
it
was
the
all
about
the
fog
creeping
into
our
very
bones
and
i
sat
there
trying
to
recollect
at
any
rate
something
under
those
that
i
ought
to
have
known
so
well
just
think
now
i
had
lost
my
best
years
where
for
i
was
past
the
prime
of
life
my
hair
and
beard
were
scattered
with
white
my
body
was
growing
weaker
my
memory
of
all
things
was
very
faint
my
raiment
purple
and
scarlet
and
blue
once
was
so
stained
that
you
could
scarce
call
it
any
colour
was
so
tattered
that
it
scarce
covered
my
body
though
it
seemed
once
to
have
fallen
in
heavy
folds
to
my
feet
and
still
when
i
rose
to
walk
though
the
miserable
november
mist
lay
in
great
drops
upon
my
bare
breast
yet
was
i
obliged
to
wind
my
raiment
over
my
arm
it
dragged
so
wretched
slimy
textureless
thing
in
the
brown
mud
on
my
head
was
a
light
morion
which
pressed
on
my
brow
and
pained
me
so
i
put
my
hand
up
to
take
it
ofi
but
when
i
touched
it
i
stood
still
in
my
walk
shuddering
i
nearly
fell
to
the
earth
with
shame
and
sick
horror
for
i
laid
my
hand
on
a
lump
of
slimy
earth
with
worms
coiled
up
in
it
i
could
scarce
forbear
from
shrieking
but
breathing
such
a
prayer
as
i
could
think
of
i
raised
my
hand
again
and
seized
it
firmly
worse
horror
stilll
the
rust
had
eaten
it
into
holes
and
i
gripped
my
own
hair
as
well
as
the
rotting
steel
the
sharp
edge
of
which
cut
into
my
fingers
but
setting
my
teeth
gave
a
great
wrench
for
i
knew
that
if
i
let
go
of
it
then
no
power
on
the
earth
or
under
it
could
make
me
touch
it
again
god
be
praised
i
tore
it
off
and
cast
it
far
from
me
i
saw
the
earth
and
the
worms
and
green
weeds
and
begotten
slime
whirling
out
from
it
radiatingly
as
it
spun
round
about
i
was
girt
with
a
sword
too
the
leathern
belt
of
which
had
shrunk
and
squeezed
my
waist
dead
leaves
had
gathered
in
knots
about
the
buckles
of
it
the
gilded
handle
was
encrusted
with
clay
in
many
parts
the
velvet
sheath
miserably
worn
but
verily
when
i
took
hold
of
the
hilt
and
pent
in
my
hand
lo
then
i
drew
out
my
own
true
blade
and
shook
it
flawless
from
hilt
to
point
gleaming
white
in
that
mist
therefore
it
sent
a
thrill
of
joy
to
my
heart
to
know
that
there
was
one
friend
left
me
yet
i
sheathed
it
again
carefully
and
undoing
it
from
my
waist
hung
it
about
my
neck
then
catching
up
my
rags
in
my
arms
i
drew
them
up
till
my
legs
and
feet
were
altogether
clear
from
them
afterwards
folded
my
arms
over
my
breast
gave
a
long
leap
and
ran
looking
downward
but
not
giving
heed
to
my
way
once
or
twice
i
fell
over
stumps
of
trees
and
like
for
it
was
a
wood
that
i
was
in
but
i
rose
always
though
bleeding
and
confused
and
went
on
still
sometimes
tearing
madly
through
briars
and
gorse
bushes
so
that
my
blood
dropped
on
the
dead
leaves
as
i
went
i
ran
in
this
way
for
about
an
hour
then
i
heard
a
gurgling
and
splashing
of
waters
i
gave
a
great
shout
and
leapt
strongly
with
shut
eyes
and
the
black
water
closed
over
me
when
i
rose
again
i
saw
near
me
a
boat
with
a
man
in
it
but
the
shore
was
far
off
i
struck
out
toward
the
boat
but
my
clothes
which
i
had
knotted
and
folded
about
me
weighed
me
down
terribly
the
man
looked
at
me
and
began
to
paddle
toward
me
with
the
oar
he
held
in
his
left
hand
having
in
his
right
a
long
slender
spear
barbed
like
a
perhaps
i
thought
it
is
some
fishing
spear
moreover
his
raiment
was
of
scarlet
with
upright
stripes
of
yellow
and
black
all
over
it
when
my
eye
caught
his
a
smile
widened
his
mouth
as
if
some
one
had
made
a
joke
but
i
was
beginning
to
sink
and
indeed
my
head
was
almost
under
water
just
as
he
came
and
stood
above
me
but
before
it
went
quite
under
i
saw
his
spear
gleam
then
felt
it
in
my
shoulder
and
for
the
present
felt
nothing
else
when
i
woke
i
was
on
the
bank
of
that
river
the
flooded
waters
went
hurrying
past
me
no
boat
on
them
now
from
the
river
the
ground
went
up
in
gentle
slopes
till
it
grew
a
great
hill
and
there
on
that
yes
i
might
forget
many
things
almost
everything
but
not
that
not
the
old
castle
of
my
fathers
up
among
the
hills
its
towers
blackened
now
and
shattered
yet
still
no
enemy
banner
waved
from
it
so
i
said
i
would
go
and
die
there
and
at
this
thought
i
drew
my
sword
which
yet
hung
about
my
neck
and
shook
it
in
the
air
till
the
true
steel
quivered
then
began
to
pace
towards
the
castle
i
was
quite
naked
no
rag
about
me
i
took
no
heed
of
that
only
thanking
god
that
my
sword
was
left
and
so
toiled
up
the
hill
i
entered
the
castle
soon
by
the
outer
court
i
knew
the
way
so
well
that
i
did
not
lift
my
eyes
from
the
groimd
but
walked
on
over
the
lowered
drawbridge
through
the
unguarded
gates
and
stood
in
the
great
hall
at
lastmy
father
hall
as
bare
of
everything
but
my
sword
as
when
i
came
into
the
world
fifty
years
before
i
had
as
little
clothes
as
little
wealth
less
memory
and
thought
i
verily
believe
than
then
so
i
lifted
up
my
eyes
and
gazed
no
glass
in
the
windows
no
hangings
on
the
walls
the
vaulting
yet
held
good
throughout
but
seemed
to
be
going
the
mortar
had
fallen
out
from
between
the
stones
and
grass
and
fern
grew
in
the
joints
the
marble
pavement
was
in
some
places
gone
and
water
stood
about
in
puddles
though
one
scarce
knew
how
it
had
got
there
no
hangings
on
the
no
yet
strange
to
say
instead
of
them
the
walls
blazed
from
end
to
end
with
scarlet
paintings
only
striped
across
with
green
in
many
places
some
falling
bodily
from
the
wall
the
plaster
hanging
down
with
the
fading
colour
on
it
in
all
of
them
except
for
the
shadows
and
the
faces
of
the
figures
there
was
scarce
any
colour
but
scarlet
and
yellow
here
and
there
it
seemed
the
painter
whoever
it
was
had
tried
to
make
his
trees
or
his
grass
green
but
it
would
not
do
some
ghastly
thoughts
must
have
filled
his
head
for
all
the
green
went
presently
into
yellow
through
the
picture
dismally
but
the
faces
were
painted
to
the
very
life
or
it
seemed
so
there
were
only
five
of
them
however
that
were
very
marked
or
came
much
in
the
foreground
and
four
of
these
i
knew
well
though
i
did
not
then
remember
the
names
of
those
that
had
borne
them
they
were
red
harald
swanhilda
amald
and
myself
the
fifth
i
did
not
know
it
was
a
woman
and
very
beautiful
then
i
saw
that
in
some
parts
a
small
penthouse
roof
had
been
built
over
the
paintings
to
keep
them
from
the
weather
near
one
of
these
stood
a
man
painting
clothed
in
red
with
stripes
of
yellow
and
black
then
i
knew
that
it
was
the
same
man
who
had
saved
me
from
drowning
by
spearing
me
through
the
shoulder
so
i
went
up
to
him
and
saw
furthermore
that
he
was
girt
with
a
heavy
sword
he
turned
round
when
he
saw
me
coming
and
asked
me
fiercely
what
i
did
there
i
asked
why
he
was
painting
in
my
castle
thereupon
with
that
same
grim
smile
widening
his
mouth
as
heretofore
he
said
i
paint
god
judgments
and
as
he
spoke
he
rattled
the
sword
in
his
scabbard
but
i
said
well
then
you
paint
them
very
badly
listen
i
know
god
judgments
much
better
than
you
do
see
now
i
will
teach
you
god
judgments
and
you
shall
teach
me
painting
while
i
spoke
he
still
rattled
his
sword
and
when
i
had
done
shut
his
right
eye
tight
screwing
his
nose
on
one
side
then
said
you
have
got
no
clothes
on
and
may
go
to
the
devil
what
do
you
know
about
god
judgments
well
they
are
not
all
yellow
and
red
at
all
events
you
ought
to
know
better
he
screamed
out
you
fool
yellow
and
red
gold
and
blood
what
do
they
make
well
i
said
what
hell
and
coming
close
up
to
me
he
struck
me
with
his
open
hand
in
the
face
so
that
the
colour
with
which
his
hand
was
smeared
was
dabbed
about
my
face
the
blow
almost
threw
me
down
and
while
i
staggered
he
rushed
at
me
furiously
with
his
sword
perhaps
it
was
good
for
me
that
i
had
got
no
clothes
on
for
being
utterly
unencumbered
i
leapt
this
way
and
that
and
avoided
his
fierce
eager
strokes
till
i
could
collect
myself
somewhat
while
he
had
a
heavy
scarlet
cloak
on
that
trailed
on
the
ground
and
which
he
often
trod
on
so
that
he
stumbled
he
very
nearly
slew
me
during
the
first
few
minutes
for
it
was
not
strange
that
together
with
other
matters
i
should
have
forgotten
the
art
of
fence
but
yet
as
i
went
on
and
sometimes
bounded
about
the
hall
under
the
whizzing
of
his
sword
as
he
rested
sometimes
leaning
on
it
as
the
point
sometimes
touched
my
head
and
made
my
eyes
start
out
i
remembered
the
old
joy
that
i
used
to
have
and
the
swy
swy
of
the
sharp
edge
as
one
gazed
between
one
horse
ears
moreover
at
last
one
fierce
swift
stroke
just
touching
me
below
the
throat
tore
up
the
skin
all
down
my
body
and
fell
heavy
on
my
thigh
so
that
i
drew
my
breath
in
and
turned
white
then
first
as
i
swung
my
sword
round
my
head
our
blades
met
oh
to
hear
that
tchink
again
and
i
felt
the
notch
my
sword
made
in
his
and
swung
out
at
him
but
he
guarded
it
and
returned
on
me
i
guarded
right
and
left
and
grew
warm
and
opened
my
mouth
to
shout
but
knew
not
what
to
say
and
our
sword
points
fell
on
the
floor
together
then
when
we
had
panted
awhile
i
wiped
from
my
face
the
blood
that
had
been
dashed
over
it
shook
my
sword
and
cut
at
him
then
we
spun
round
and
round
in
a
mad
waltz
to
the
measured
music
of
our
meeting
swords
and
sometimes
either
wounded
the
other
somewhat
but
not
much
till
i
beat
down
his
sword
on
to
his
head
that
he
fell
grovelling
but
not
cut
through
verily
thereupon
my
lips
opened
mightily
with
mary
rings
then
when
he
had
gotten
to
his
feet
i
went
at
him
again
he
staggering
back
guarding
wildly
i
cut
at
his
head
he
put
his
sword
up
confusedly
so
i
fitted
both
hands
to
my
hilt
and
smote
him
mightily
under
the
arm
then
his
shriek
mingled
with
my
shout
made
a
strange
sound
together
he
rolled
over
and
over
dead
as
i
thought
i
walked
about
the
hall
in
great
exultation
at
first
striking
my
sword
point
on
the
floor
every
now
and
then
till
i
grew
faint
with
loss
of
blood
then
i
went
to
my
enemy
and
stripped
off
some
of
his
clothes
to
bind
up
my
wounds
withal
afterwards
i
found
in
a
corner
bread
and
wine
and
i
eat
and
drank
thereof
then
i
went
back
to
him
and
looked
and
a
thought
struck
me
and
i
took
some
of
his
paints
and
brushes
and
kneeling
down
painted
his
face
thus
with
stripes
of
yellow
and
red
crossing
each
other
at
right
angles
and
in
each
of
the
squares
so
made
i
put
a
spot
of
black
after
the
manner
of
the
painted
letters
in
the
and
romances
when
they
are
ornamented
so
i
stood
back
as
painters
use
folded
my
arms
and
admired
my
own
handiwork
yet
there
struck
me
as
being
something
so
utterly
doleful
in
the
man
white
face
and
the
blood
running
all
about
him
and
washing
off
the
stains
of
paint
from
his
face
and
hands
and
splashed
clothes
that
my
heart
gave
me
and
i
hoped
that
he
was
not
dead
i
took
some
water
from
a
vessel
he
had
been
using
for
his
painting
and
kneeling
washed
his
face
was
it
some
resemblance
to
my
father
dead
face
which
i
had
seen
when
i
was
young
that
made
me
pity
him
i
laid
my
hand
upon
his
heart
and
felt
it
beating
feebly
so
i
lifted
him
up
gently
and
carried
him
towards
a
heap
of
straw
that
he
seemed
used
to
lie
upon
there
i
stripped
him
and
looked
to
his
wounds
and
used
the
memory
of
which
god
gave
me
for
this
purpose
i
suppose
and
within
seven
days
i
found
that
he
would
not
die
afterwards
as
i
wandered
about
the
castle
i
came
to
a
room
in
one
of
the
upper
storeys
that
had
still
the
roof
on
and
windows
in
it
with
painted
glass
and
there
i
found
green
raiment
and
swords
and
armour
and
i
clothed
myself
so
when
he
got
well
i
asked
him
what
his
name
was
and
he
me
and
we
both
of
us
said
truly
i
know
not
then
said
i
but
we
must
call
each
other
some
name
even
as
men
call
days
call
me
swerker
he
said
some
priest
i
knew
once
had
that
name
and
me
wulf
said
i
though
wherefore
i
know
not
then
i
tried
to
learn
painting
till
i
thought
i
should
die
but
at
last
learned
it
through
very
much
pain
and
grief
and
as
the
years
went
on
and
we
grew
old
and
grey
we
painted
purple
pictures
and
green
ones
instead
of
the
scarlet
and
yellow
so
that
the
walls
looked
altered
and
always
we
painted
god
judgments
and
we
would
sit
in
the
sunset
and
watch
them
with
the
golden
light
changing
them
as
we
yet
hoped
god
would
change
both
us
and
our
works
often
too
we
would
sit
outside
the
walls
and
look
at
the
trees
and
sky
and
the
ways
of
the
few
men
and
women
we
saw
therefrom
sometimes
befell
adventures
once
there
went
past
a
great
funeral
of
some
king
going
to
his
own
country
not
as
he
had
hoped
to
go
but
stiff
and
colourless
spices
filling
up
the
place
of
his
heart
and
first
went
by
very
many
knights
with
long
bright
hauberks
on
that
fell
down
before
their
knees
as
they
rode
and
they
all
had
on
with
the
same
crest
so
that
their
faces
were
quite
hidden
and
this
crest
was
two
hands
clasped
together
tightly
as
though
they
were
the
hands
of
one
praying
forgiveness
from
the
one
he
loves
best
and
the
crest
was
wrought
in
gold
moreover
they
had
on
over
their
hauberks
surcoats
which
were
half
scarlet
and
half
purple
strewn
about
with
golden
stars
also
long
lances
that
had
forked
half
purple
and
half
scarlet
strewn
with
golden
stars
and
these
went
by
with
no
sound
but
the
fall
of
their
and
they
went
slowly
so
slowly
that
we
counted
them
all
five
thousand
five
hundred
and
then
went
by
many
fair
maidens
whose
hair
was
loose
and
yellow
and
who
were
all
clad
in
green
raiment
ungirded
and
shod
with
golden
shoes
these
also
we
counted
being
five
hundred
moreover
some
of
the
outermost
of
them
one
maiden
to
every
twenty
had
long
silver
trumpets
which
they
swung
out
to
right
and
left
blowing
them
and
their
sound
was
very
sad
then
many
priests
and
bishops
and
abbots
who
wore
white
albs
and
golden
copes
over
them
and
they
all
sang
together
mournfully
propter
amnen
babylonis
and
these
were
three
hundred
after
that
came
a
great
knot
of
the
lords
who
were
tilting
helmets
and
surcoats
emblazoned
with
each
one
his
own
device
only
each
had
in
his
hand
a
small
staff
two
feet
long
whereon
was
a
pennon
of
scarlet
and
purple
these
also
were
three
hundred
and
in
the
midst
of
these
was
a
great
car
hung
down
to
the
ground
with
purple
drawn
by
grey
horses
whose
trappings
were
half
scarlet
half
purple
and
on
this
car
lay
the
king
whose
head
and
hands
were
bare
and
he
had
on
him
a
surcoat
half
purple
and
half
scarlet
strewn
with
golden
stars
and
his
head
rested
on
a
tilting
helmet
whose
crest
was
the
hands
of
one
praying
passionately
for
forgiveness
but
his
own
hands
lay
by
his
side
as
if
he
had
just
fallen
asleep
and
all
about
the
car
were
little
banners
half
purple
and
half
scarlet
strewn
with
golden
stars
then
the
king
who
counted
but
as
one
went
by
also
and
after
him
came
again
many
maidens
clad
in
ungirt
white
raiment
strewn
with
scarlet
flowers
and
their
hair
was
loose
and
yellow
and
their
feet
bare
and
except
for
the
falling
of
their
feet
and
the
rustle
of
the
wind
through
their
raiment
they
went
past
quite
silently
these
also
were
five
hundred
then
lastly
came
many
young
knights
with
long
bright
hauberks
falling
over
their
knees
as
they
rode
and
surcoats
half
scarlet
and
half
purple
strewn
with
golden
stars
they
bore
long
lances
with
forked
nons
which
were
half
purple
half
scarlet
strewn
with
golden
stars
their
heads
and
their
hands
were
bare
but
they
bore
shields
each
one
of
them
which
were
of
bright
steel
wrought
cunningly
in
the
midst
with
that
bearing
of
the
two
hands
of
one
who
prays
for
forgiveness
which
was
done
in
gold
these
were
but
five
hundred
then
they
all
went
by
winding
up
and
up
the
hill
roads
and
when
the
last
of
them
had
departed
out
of
our
sight
we
put
down
our
heads
and
wept
and
i
said
sing
us
one
of
the
songs
of
the
hollow
land
then
he
whom
i
had
called
swerker
put
his
hand
into
his
bosom
and
slowly
drew
out
a
long
long
tress
of
black
hair
and
laid
it
on
his
knee
and
smoothed
it
weeping
on
it
so
then
i
left
him
there
and
went
and
armed
myself
and
brought
armour
for
him
and
then
came
back
to
him
and
threw
the
armour
down
so
that
it
clanged
and
said
o
harald
let
us
go
he
did
not
seem
surprised
that
i
called
him
by
the
right
name
but
rose
and
armed
himself
and
then
be
looked
a
good
knight
so
we
set
forth
and
in
a
turn
of
the
long
road
we
came
suddenly
upon
a
most
fair
woman
clothed
in
scarlet
who
sat
and
sobbed
holding
her
face
between
her
bands
and
her
hair
was
very
black
and
when
harald
saw
her
he
stood
and
gazed
at
her
for
long
through
the
bars
of
bis
helmet
then
suddenly
turned
and
said
florian
i
must
stop
here
do
you
go
on
to
the
hollow
land
farewell
farewell
and
then
i
went
on
never
turning
back
and
him
i
never
saw
more
and
so
i
went
on
quite
lonely
but
happy
till
i
had
reached
the
hollow
land
into
which
i
let
myself
down
most
carefully
by
the
jutting
rocks
and
bushes
and
strange
trailing
flowers
and
there
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
fytte
the
third
and
i
was
waked
by
some
one
singing
i
felt
very
happy
i
felt
young
again
i
had
fair
delicate
raiment
on
my
sword
was
gone
and
my
armour
i
tried
to
think
where
i
was
and
could
not
for
my
happiness
i
tried
to
listen
to
the
words
of
the
song
nothing
only
an
old
echo
in
my
ears
only
all
manner
of
strange
scenes
from
my
wretched
past
life
before
my
eyes
in
a
dim
manner
then
at
last
slowly
without
effort
i
heard
what
she
sang
christ
keep
the
hollow
land
all
the
still
we
can
not
understand
where
the
waters
glide
only
dimly
seeing
them
coldly
slipping
through
many
cavern
mouths
where
the
hills
are
blue
then
she
said
come
now
and
look
for
it
love
a
hollow
city
in
the
hollow
land
i
kissed
margaret
and
we
went
through
the
golden
streets
under
the
purple
shadows
of
the
houses
we
went
and
the
slow
fanning
backward
and
forward
of
the
banners
cooled
us
we
two
alone
there
was
no
one
with
us
no
soul
will
ever
be
able
to
tell
what
we
said
how
we
looked
at
last
we
came
to
a
fair
palace
cloistered
off
in
the
old
time
before
the
city
grew
golden
from
the
din
and
hubbub
of
traffic
those
who
dwelt
there
in
the
old
ungolden
times
had
had
their
own
joys
their
own
sorrows
apart
from
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
the
multitude
so
in
like
manner
was
it
now
cloistered
off
from
the
eager
leaning
and
brotherhood
of
the
golden
dwellings
so
now
it
had
its
own
gaiety
its
own
solemnity
apart
from
theirs
unchanged
and
changeable
were
its
marble
walls
whatever
else
changed
about
it
we
stopped
before
the
gates
and
trembled
and
clasped
each
other
closer
for
there
among
the
marble
leafage
and
tendrils
that
were
round
and
under
and
over
the
archway
that
held
the
golden
valves
were
wrought
two
figures
of
a
man
and
woman
winged
and
garlanded
whose
raiment
flashed
with
stars
and
their
faces
were
like
faces
we
had
seen
or
half
seen
in
some
dream
long
and
long
and
long
ago
so
that
we
trembled
with
awe
and
delight
and
turned
and
seeing
margaret
saw
that
her
face
was
that
face
seen
or
half
seen
long
and
long
and
long
ago
and
in
the
shining
of
her
eyes
i
saw
that
other
face
seen
in
that
way
and
no
other
long
and
long
and
long
ago
my
face
and
then
we
walked
together
toward
the
golden
gates
and
opened
them
and
no
man
gainsaid
us
and
before
us
lay
a
great
space
of
flowers
