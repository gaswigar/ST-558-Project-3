the

in
those
days
there
were
many
hermits
living
in
the
desert
on
both
banks
of
the
nile
numerous
huts
built
by
these
solitary
dwellers
of
branches
held
together
by
clay
were
scattered
at
a
little
distance
from
each
other
so
that
the
inhabitants
could
live
alone
and
yet
help
one
another
in
case
of
need
churches
each
surmounted
by
a
cross
stood
here
and
there
amongst
the
huts
and
the
monks
flocked
to
them
at
each
festival
to
celebrate
the
services
or
to
partake
of
the
communion
there
were
also
here
and
there
on
the
banks
of
the
river
monasteries
where
the
cenobites
lived
in
separate
cells
and
only
met
together
that
they
might
the
better
enjoy
their
solitude
both
hermits
and
cenobites
led
abstemious
lives
taking
no
food
till
after
sunset
and
eating
nothing
but
bread
with
a
little
salt
and
hyssop
some
retired
into
the
desert
and
led
a
still
more
strange
life
in
some
cave
or
tomb
all
lived
in
temperance
and
chastity
they
wore
a
hair
shirt
and
a
hood
slept
on
the
bare
ground
after
long
watching
prayed
sang
psalms
and
in
short
spent
their
days
in
works
of
penitence
as
an
atonement
for
original
sin
they
refused
their
body
not
only
all
pleasures
and
satisfactions
but
even
that
care
and
attention
which
in
this
age
are
deemed
indispensable
they
believed
that
the
diseases
of
our
members
purify
our
souls
and
the
flesh
could
put
on
no
adornment
more
glorious
than
wounds
and
ulcers
thus
they
thought
they
fulfilled
the
words
of
the
prophet
the
desert
shall
rejoice
and
blossom
as
the
amongst
the
inhabitants
of
the
holy
thebaid
there
were
some
who
passed
their
days
in
asceticism
and
contemplation
others
gained
their
livelihood
by
plaiting
palm
fibre
or
by
working
at
for
the
neighbouring
farmers
the
gentiles
wrongly
suspected
some
of
them
of
living
by
brigandage
and
allying
themselves
to
the
nomadic
arabs
who
robbed
the
caravans
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
monks
despised
riches
and
the
odour
of
their
sanctity
rose
to
heaven
angels
in
the
likeness
of
young
men
came
staff
in
hand
as
travellers
to
visit
the
hermitages
whilst
demons
having
assumed
the
form
of
ethiopians
or
of
animals
wandered
round
the
habitations
of
the
hermits
in
order
to
lead
them
into
temptation
when
the
monks
went
in
the
morning
to
fill
their
pitcher
at
the
spring
they
saw
the
footprints
of
satyrs
and
aigipans
in
the
sand
the
thebaid
was
really
and
spiritually
a
battlefield
where
at
all
times
and
more
especially
at
night
there
were
terrible
conflicts
between
heaven
and
hell
the
ascetics
furiously
assailed
by
legions
of
the
damned
defended
themselves
with
the
help
of
god
and
the
angels
by
fasting
prayer
and
penance
sometimes
carnal
desires
pricked
them
so
cruelly
that
they
cried
aloud
with
pain
and
their
lamentations
rose
to
the
starlit
heavens
mingled
with
the
howls
of
the
hungry
hyaenas
then
it
was
that
the
demons
appeared
in
delightful
forms
for
though
the
demons
are
in
reality
hideous
they
sometimes
assume
an
appearance
of
beauty
which
prevents
their
real
nature
from
being
recognised
the
ascetics
of
the
thebaid
were
amazed
to
see
in
their
cells
phantasms
of
delights
unknown
even
to
the
voluptuaries
of
the
age
but
as
they
were
under
the
sign
of
the
cross
they
did
not
succumb
to
these
temptations
and
the
unclean
spirits
assuming
again
their
true
character
fled
at
daybreak
filled
with
rage
and
shame
it
was
not
unusual
to
meet
at
dawn
one
of
these
beings
flying
away
and
weeping
and
replying
to
those
who
questioned
it
i
weep
and
groan
because
one
of
the
christians
who
live
here
has
beaten
me
with
rods
and
driven
me
away
in
the
power
of
the
old
saints
of
the
desert
extended
over
all
sinners
and
unbelievers
their
goodness
was
sometimes
terrible
they
derived
from
the
apostles
authority
to
punish
all
offences
against
the
true
and
only
god
and
no
earthly
power
could
save
those
they
condemned
strange
tales
were
told
in
the
cities
and
even
as
far
as
alexandria
how
the
earth
had
opened
and
swallowed
up
certain
wicked
persons
whom
one
of
these
saints
struck
with
his
staff
therefore
they
were
feared
by
all
and
particularly
by
mimes
mountebanks
married
priests
and
prostitutes
such
was
the
sanctity
of
these
holy
men
that
even
wild
beasts
felt
their
power
when
a
hermit
was
about
to
die
a
lion
came
and
dug
a
grave
with
its
claws
the
saint
knew
by
this
that
god
had
called
him
and
he
went
and
kissed
all
his
brethren
on
the
cheek
then
he
lay
down
joyfully
and
slept
in
the
lord
now
that
anthony
who
was
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
had
retired
to
mount
colzin
with
his
disciples
macarius
and
amathas
there
was
no
monk
in
the
thebaid
more
renowned
for
good
works
than
paphnutius
the
abbot
of
antinoe
ephrem
and
serapion
had
a
greater
number
of
followers
and
in
the
spiritual
and
temporal
management
of
their
monasteries
surpassed
him
but
paphnutius
observed
the
most
rigorous
fasts
and
often
went
for
three
entire
days
without
taking
food
he
wore
a
very
rough
hair
shirt
he
flogged
himself
night
and
morning
and
lay
for
hours
with
his
face
to
the
earth
his
disciples
had
built
their
huts
near
his
and
imitated
his
austerities
he
loved
them
all
dearly
in
jesus
christ
and
unceasingly
exhorted
them
to
good
works
amongst
his
spiritual
children
were
men
who
had
been
robbers
for
many
years
and
had
been
persuaded
by
the
exhortations
of
the
holy
abbot
to
embrace
the
monastic
life
and
who
now
edified
their
companions
by
the
purity
of
their
lives
one
who
had
been
cook
to
the
queen
of
abyssinia
and
was
converted
by
the
abbot
of
antinoe
never
ceased
to
weep
there
was
also
flavian
the
deacon
who
knew
the
scriptures
and
spoke
well
but
the
disciple
of
paphnutius
who
surpassed
all
the
others
in
holiness
was
a
young
peasant
named
paul
and
surnamed
the
fool
because
of
his
extreme
simplicity
men
laughed
at
his
childishness
but
god
favoured
him
with
visions
and
by
bestowing
upon
him
the
gift
of
prophecy
paphnutius
passed
his
life
in
teaching
his
disciples
and
in
ascetic
practices
often
did
he
meditate
upon
the
holy
scriptures
in
order
to
find
allegories
in
them
therefore
he
abounded
in
good
works
though
still
young
the
devils
who
so
rudely
assailed
the
good
hermits
did
not
dare
to
approach
him
at
night
seven
little
jackals
sat
in
the
moonlight
in
front
of
his
cell
silent
and
motionless
and
with
their
ears
pricked
up
it
was
believed
that
they
were
seven
devils
who
owing
to
his
sanctity
could
not
cross
his
threshold
paphnutius
was
born
at
alexandria
of
noble
parents
who
had
instructed
him
in
all
profane
learning
he
had
even
been
allured
by
the
falsehoods
of
the
poets
and
in
his
early
youth
had
been
misguided
enough
to
believe
that
the
human
race
had
all
been
drowned
by
a
deluge
in
the
days
of
deucalion
and
had
argued
with
his
concerning
the
nature
the
attributes
and
even
the
existence
of
god
he
then
led
a
life
of
dissipation
after
the
manner
of
the
gentiles
and
he
recalled
the
memory
of
those
days
with
shame
and
horror
at
that
time
he
used
to
say
to
the
brethren
i
seethed
in
the
cauldron
of
false
he
meant
by
that
that
he
had
eaten
food
properly
dressed
and
frequented
the
public
baths
in
fact
until
his
twentieth
year
he
had
continued
to
lead
the
ordinary
existence
of
those
times
which
now
seemed
to
him
rather
death
than
life
but
owing
to
the
lessons
of
the
priest
macrinus
he
then
became
a
new
man
the
truth
penetrated
him
through
and
through
and
as
he
used
to
say
entered
his
soul
like
a
sword
he
embraced
the
faith
of
calvary
and
worshipped
christ
crucified
after
his
baptism
he
remained
yet
a
year
amongst
the
gentiles
unable
to
cast
off
the
bonds
of
old
habits
but
one
day
he
entered
a
church
and
heard
a
deacon
read
from
the
bible
the
verse
if
thou
wilt
be
perfect
go
and
sell
that
thou
hast
and
give
to
the
thereupon
he
sold
all
that
he
had
gave
away
the
money
in
alms
and
embraced
the
monastic
life
during
the
ten
years
that
he
had
lived
remote
from
men
he
no
longer
seethed
in
the
cauldron
of
false
delights
but
more
profitably
macerated
his
flesh
in
the
balms
of
penitence
one
day
when
according
to
his
pious
custom
he
was
recalling
to
mind
the
hours
he
had
lived
apart
from
god
and
examining
his
sins
one
by
one
that
he
might
the
better
ponder
on
their
enormity
he
remembered
that
he
had
seen
at
the
theatre
at
alexandria
a
very
beautiful
actress
named
thais
this
woman
showed
herself
in
the
public
games
and
did
not
scruple
to
perform
dances
the
movements
of
which
arranged
only
too
cleverly
brought
to
mind
the
most
horrible
passions
sometimes
she
imitated
the
horrible
deeds
which
the
pagan
fables
ascribe
to
venus
leda
or
pasiphae
thus
she
fired
all
the
spectators
with
lust
and
when
handsome
young
men
or
rich
old
ones
came
inspired
with
love
to
hang
wreaths
of
flowers
round
her
door
she
welcomed
them
and
gave
herself
up
to
them
so
that
whilst
she
lost
her
own
soul
she
also
ruined
the
souls
of
many
others
she
had
almost
led
paphnutius
himself
into
the
sins
of
the
flesh
she
had
awakened
desire
in
him
and
he
had
once
approached
the
house
of
thais
but
he
stopped
on
the
threshold
of
the
courtesan
s
house
partly
restrained
by
the
natural
timidity
of
extreme
youth
he
was
then
but
fifteen
years
old
and
partly
by
the
fear
of
being
refused
on
account
of
his
want
of
money
for
his
parents
took
care
that
he
should
commit
no
great
extravagances
god
in
his
mercy
had
used
these
two
means
to
prevent
him
from
committing
a
great
sin
but
paphnutius
had
not
been
grateful
to
him
for
that
because
at
that
time
he
was
blind
to
his
own
interests
and
did
not
know
that
he
was
lusting
after
false
delights
now
kneeling
in
his
cell
before
the
image
of
that
holy
cross
on
which
hung
as
in
a
balance
the
ransom
of
the
world
paphnutius
began
to
think
of
thais
because
thais
was
a
sin
to
him
and
he
meditated
long
according
to
ascetic
rules
on
the
fearful
hideousness
of
the
carnal
delights
with
which
this
woman
had
inspired
him
in
the
days
of
his
sin
and
ignorance
after
some
hours
of
meditation
the
image
of
thais
appeared
to
him
clearly
and
distinctly
he
saw
her
again
as
he
had
seen
her
when
she
tempted
him
in
all
the
beauty
of
the
flesh
at
first
she
showed
herself
like
a
leda
softly
lying
upon
a
bed
of
hyacinths
her
head
bowed
her
eyes
humid
and
filled
with
a
strange
light
her
nostrils
quivering
her
mouth
half
open
her
breasts
like
two
flowers
and
her
arms
smooth
and
fresh
as
two
brooks
at
this
sight
paphnutius
struck
his
breast
and
said
i
call
thee
to
witness
my
god
that
i
have
considered
how
heinous
has
been
my
gradually
the
face
of
the
image
changed
its
expression
little
by
little
the
lips
of
thais
by
lowering
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
expressed
a
mysterious
suffering
her
large
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
and
lights
her
breast
heaved
with
sighs
like
the
sighing
of
a
wind
that
precedes
a
tempest
at
this
sight
paphnutius
was
troubled
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
prostrating
himself
on
the
floor
he
uttered
this
prayer
thou
who
hast
put
pity
in
our
hearts
like
the
morning
dew
upon
the
fields
o
just
and
merciful
god
be
thou
blessed
praise
praise
be
unto
thee
put
away
from
thy
servant
that
false
tenderness
which
tempts
to
concupiscence
and
grant
that
i
may
only
love
thy
creatures
in
thee
for
they
pass
away
but
thou
endurest
for
ever
if
i
care
for
this
woman
it
is
only
because
she
is
thy
handiwork
the
angels
themselves
feel
pity
for
her
is
she
not
o
lord
the
breath
of
thy
mouth
let
her
not
continue
to
sin
with
many
citizens
and
strangers
there
is
great
pity
for
her
in
my
heart
her
wickednesses
are
abominable
and
but
to
think
of
them
makes
my
flesh
creep
but
the
more
wicked
she
is
the
more
do
i
lament
for
her
i
weep
when
i
think
that
the
devils
will
torment
her
to
all
as
he
was
meditating
in
this
way
he
saw
a
little
jackal
lying
at
his
feet
he
felt
much
surprised
for
the
door
of
his
cell
had
been
closed
since
the
morning
the
animal
seemed
to
read
the
abbot
s
thoughts
and
wagged
its
tail
like
a
dog
paphnutius
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
the
beast
vanished
he
knew
then
that
for
the
first
time
the
devil
had
entered
his
cell
and
he
uttered
a
short
prayer
then
he
thought
again
about
thais
with
god
s
help
he
said
to
himself
i
must
save
and
he
slept
the
next
morning
when
he
had
said
his
prayers
he
went
to
see
the
sainted
palemon
a
holy
hermit
who
lived
some
distance
away
he
found
him
smiling
quietly
as
he
dug
the
ground
as
was
his
custom
palemon
was
an
old
man
and
cultivated
a
little
garden
the
wild
beasts
came
and
licked
his
hands
and
the
devils
never
tormented
him
may
god
be
praised
brother
paphnutius
he
said
as
he
leaned
upon
his
spade
god
be
praised
replied
paphnutius
and
peace
be
unto
my
the
like
peace
be
unto
thee
brother
paphnutius
said
palemon
and
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
with
his
sleeve
brother
palemon
all
our
discourse
ought
to
be
solely
the
praise
of
him
who
has
promised
to
be
wheresoever
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
his
name
that
is
why
i
come
to
you
concerning
a
design
i
have
formed
to
glorify
the
may
the
lord
bless
thy
design
paphnutius
as
he
has
blessed
my
lettuces
every
morning
he
spreads
his
grace
with
the
dew
on
my
garden
and
his
goodness
causes
me
to
glorify
him
in
the
cucumbers
and
melons
which
he
gives
me
let
us
pray
that
he
may
keep
us
in
his
peace
for
nothing
is
more
to
be
feared
than
those
unruly
passions
which
trouble
our
hearts
when
these
passions
disturb
us
we
are
like
drunken
men
and
we
stagger
from
right
to
left
unceasingly
and
are
like
to
fall
miserably
sometimes
these
passions
plunge
us
into
a
turbulent
joy
and
he
who
gives
way
to
such
sullies
the
air
with
brutish
laughter
such
false
joy
drags
the
sinner
into
all
sorts
of
excess
but
sometimes
also
the
troubles
of
the
soul
and
of
the
senses
throw
us
into
an
impious
sadness
which
is
a
thousand
times
worse
than
the
joy
brother
paphnutius
i
am
but
a
miserable
sinner
but
i
have
found
in
my
long
life
that
the
cenobite
has
no
foe
worse
than
sadness
i
mean
by
that
the
obstinate
melancholy
which
envelopes
the
soul
as
in
a
mist
and
hides
from
us
the
light
of
god
nothing
is
more
contrary
to
salvation
and
the
devil
s
greatest
triumph
is
to
sow
black
and
bitter
thoughts
in
the
heart
of
a
good
man
if
he
sent
us
only
pleasurable
temptations
he
would
not
be
half
so
much
to
be
feared
alas
he
excels
in
making
us
sad
did
he
not
show
to
our
father
anthony
a
black
child
of
such
surpassing
beauty
that
the
very
sight
of
it
drew
tears
with
god
s
help
our
father
anthony
avoided
the
snares
of
the
demon
i
knew
him
when
he
lived
amongst
us
he
was
cheerful
with
his
disciples
and
never
gave
way
to
melancholy
but
did
you
not
come
my
brother
to
talk
to
me
of
a
design
you
had
formed
in
your
mind
let
me
know
what
it
is
if
at
least
this
design
has
for
its
object
the
glory
of
brother
palemon
what
i
propose
is
really
to
the
glory
of
god
strengthen
me
with
your
counsel
for
you
know
many
things
and
sin
has
never
darkened
the
clearness
of
your
brother
paphnutius
i
am
not
worthy
to
unloose
the
latchet
of
thy
sandals
and
my
sins
are
as
countless
as
the
sands
of
the
desert
but
i
am
old
and
i
will
never
refuse
the
help
of
my
i
will
confide
in
you
then
brother
palemon
that
i
am
stricken
with
grief
at
the
thought
that
there
is
in
alexandria
a
courtesan
named
thais
who
lives
in
sin
and
is
a
subject
of
reproach
unto
the
brother
paphnutius
that
is
in
truth
an
abomination
which
we
do
well
to
deplore
there
are
many
women
amongst
the
gentiles
who
lead
lives
of
that
kind
have
you
thought
of
any
remedy
for
this
great
evil
brother
palemon
i
will
go
to
alexandria
and
find
this
woman
and
with
god
s
help
i
will
convert
her
that
is
my
intention
do
you
approve
of
it
brother
brother
paphnutius
i
am
but
a
miserable
sinner
but
our
father
anthony
used
to
say
in
whatsoever
place
thou
art
hasten
not
to
leave
it
to
go
brother
palemon
do
you
disapprove
of
my
project
dear
paphnutius
god
forbid
that
i
should
suspect
my
brother
of
bad
intentions
but
our
father
anthony
also
said
fishes
die
on
dry
land
and
so
is
it
with
those
monks
who
leave
their
cells
and
mingle
with
the
men
of
this
world
amongst
whom
no
good
thing
is
to
be
having
thus
spoken
the
old
man
pressed
his
foot
on
the
spade
and
began
to
dig
energetically
round
a
fig
tree
laden
with
fruit
as
he
was
thus
engaged
there
was
a
rustling
in
the
bushes
and
an
antelope
leaped
over
the
hedge
which
surrounded
the
garden
it
stopped
surprised
and
frightened
its
delicate
legs
trembling
then
ran
up
to
the
old
man
and
laid
its
pretty
head
on
the
breast
of
its
friend
god
be
praised
in
the
gazelle
of
the
desert
said
palemon
he
went
to
his
hut
the
little
animal
trotting
after
him
and
brought
out
some
black
bread
which
the
antelope
ate
out
of
his
hand
paphnutius
remained
thoughtful
for
some
time
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
stones
at
his
feet
then
he
slowly
walked
back
to
his
cell
pondering
on
what
he
had
heard
a
great
struggle
was
going
on
in
his
mind
the
hermit
gives
good
advice
he
said
to
himself
the
spirit
of
prudence
is
in
him
and
he
doubts
the
wisdom
of
my
intention
yet
it
would
be
cruel
to
leave
thais
any
longer
in
the
power
of
the
demon
who
possesses
her
may
god
advise
and
conduct
as
he
was
walking
along
he
saw
a
plover
caught
in
the
net
that
a
hunter
had
laid
on
the
sand
and
he
knew
that
it
was
a
hen
bird
for
he
saw
the
male
fly
to
the
net
and
tear
the
meshes
one
by
one
with
its
beak
until
it
had
made
an
opening
by
which
its
mate
could
escape
the
holy
man
watched
this
incident
and
as
by
virtue
of
his
holiness
he
easily
comprehended
the
mystic
sense
of
all
occurrences
he
knew
that
the
captive
bird
was
no
other
than
thais
caught
in
the
snares
of
sin
and
that
like
the
plover
that
had
cut
the
hempen
threads
with
its
beak
he
could
by
pronouncing
the
word
of
power
break
the
invisible
bonds
by
which
thais
was
held
in
sin
therefore
he
praised
god
and
was
confirmed
in
his
first
resolution
but
then
seeing
the
plover
caught
by
the
feet
and
hampered
by
the
net
it
had
broken
he
fell
into
uncertainty
again
he
did
not
sleep
all
night
and
before
dawn
he
had
a
vision
thais
appeared
to
him
again
there
was
no
expression
of
guilty
pleasure
on
her
face
nor
was
she
dressed
according
to
custom
in
transparent
drapery
she
was
enveloped
in
a
shroud
which
hid
even
a
part
of
her
face
so
that
the
abbot
could
see
nothing
but
the
two
eyes
from
which
flowed
white
and
heavy
tears
at
this
sight
he
began
to
weep
and
believing
that
this
vision
came
from
god
he
no
longer
hesitated
he
rose
seized
a
knotted
stick
the
symbol
of
the
christian
faith
and
left
his
cell
carefully
closing
the
door
lest
the
animals
of
the
desert
and
the
birds
of
the
air
should
enter
and
befoul
the
copy
of
the
holy
scriptures
which
stood
at
the
head
of
his
bed
he
called
flavian
the
deacon
and
gave
him
authority
over
the
other
disciples
during
his
absence
and
then
clad
only
in
a
long
cassock
he
bent
his
steps
towards
the
nile
intending
to
follow
the
libyan
bank
to
the
city
founded
by
the
macedonian
monarch
he
walked
from
dawn
to
eve
indifferent
to
fatigue
hunger
and
thirst
the
sun
was
already
low
on
the
horizon
when
he
saw
the
dreadful
river
the
waters
of
which
rolled
between
the
rocks
of
gold
and
fire
he
kept
along
the
shore
begging
his
bread
at
the
door
of
solitary
huts
for
the
love
of
god
and
joyfully
receiving
insults
refusals
or
threats
he
feared
neither
robbers
nor
wild
beasts
but
he
took
great
care
to
avoid
all
the
towns
and
villages
he
came
near
he
was
afraid
lest
he
should
see
children
playing
at
before
their
father
s
house
or
meet
by
the
side
of
the
well
women
in
blue
smocks
who
might
put
down
their
pitcher
and
smile
at
him
all
things
are
dangerous
for
the
hermit
it
is
sometimes
a
danger
for
him
to
read
in
the
scriptures
that
the
divine
master
journeyed
from
town
to
town
and
supped
with
his
disciples
the
virtues
that
the
anchorites
embroider
so
carefully
on
the
tissue
of
faith
are
as
fragile
as
they
are
beautiful
a
breath
of
ordinary
life
may
tarnish
their
pleasant
colours
for
that
reason
paphnutius
avoided
the
towns
fearing
lest
his
heart
should
soften
at
the
sight
of
his
fellow
men
he
journeyed
along
lonely
roads
when
evening
came
the
murmuring
of
the
breeze
amidst
the
tamarisk
trees
made
him
shiver
and
he
pulled
his
hood
over
his
eyes
that
he
might
not
see
how
beautiful
all
things
were
after
walking
six
days
he
came
to
a
place
called
silsile
there
the
river
runs
in
a
narrow
valley
bordered
by
a
double
chain
of
granite
mountains
it
was
there
that
the
egyptians
in
the
days
when
they
worshipped
demons
carved
their
idols
paphnutius
saw
an
enormous
sphinx
carved
in
the
solid
rock
fearing
that
it
might
still
possess
some
diabolical
properties
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
pronounced
the
name
of
jesus
he
immediately
saw
a
bat
fly
out
of
one
of
the
monster
s
ears
and
paphnutius
knew
that
he
had
driven
out
the
evil
spirits
which
had
been
for
centuries
in
the
figure
his
zeal
increased
and
picking
up
a
large
stone
he
threw
it
in
the
idol
s
face
then
the
mysterious
face
of
the
sphinx
expressed
such
profound
sadness
that
paphnutius
was
moved
in
fact
the
expression
of
superhuman
grief
on
the
stone
visage
would
have
touched
even
the
most
unfeeling
man
therefore
paphnutius
said
to
the
sphinx
o
monster
be
like
the
satyrs
and
centaurs
our
father
anthony
saw
in
the
desert
and
confess
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
and
i
will
bless
thee
in
the
name
of
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
when
he
had
spoken
a
rosy
light
gleamed
in
the
eyes
of
the
sphinx
the
heavy
eyelids
of
the
monster
quivered
and
the
granite
lips
painfully
murmured
as
though
in
echo
to
the
man
s
voice
the
holy
name
of
jesus
christ
therefore
paphnutius
stretched
out
his
right
hand
and
blessed
the
sphinx
of
silsile
that
being
done
he
resumed
his
journey
and
the
valley
having
grown
wider
he
saw
the
ruins
of
an
immense
city
the
temples
which
still
remained
standing
were
supported
by
idols
which
served
as
columns
and
by
the
permission
of
god
these
figures
with
women
s
heads
and
cow
s
horns
threw
on
paphnutius
a
long
look
which
made
him
turn
pale
he
walked
thus
seventeen
days
his
only
food
a
few
raw
herbs
and
he
slept
at
night
in
some
ruined
palace
amongst
the
wild
cats
and
pharaoh
s
rats
with
which
mingled
sometimes
women
whose
bodies
ended
in
a
scaly
tail
but
paphnutius
knew
that
these
women
came
from
hell
and
he
drove
them
away
by
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
the
eighteenth
day
he
found
far
from
any
village
a
wretched
hut
made
of
palm
leaves
and
half
buried
under
the
sand
which
had
been
driven
by
the
desert
wind
he
approached
it
hoping
that
the
hut
was
inhabited
by
some
pious
anchorite
he
saw
inside
the
hovel
for
there
was
no
door
a
pitcher
a
bunch
of
onions
and
a
bed
of
dried
leaves
this
must
be
the
habitation
of
a
hermit
he
said
to
himself
hermits
are
generally
to
be
found
near
their
hut
and
i
shall
not
fail
to
meet
this
one
i
will
give
him
the
kiss
of
peace
even
as
the
holy
anthony
did
when
he
came
to
the
hermit
paul
and
kissed
him
three
times
we
will
discourse
of
things
eternal
and
perhaps
our
lord
will
send
us
by
one
of
his
ravens
a
crust
of
bread
which
my
host
will
willingly
invite
me
to
share
with
whilst
he
was
thus
speaking
to
himself
he
walked
round
the
hut
to
see
if
he
could
find
any
one
he
had
not
walked
a
hundred
paces
when
he
saw
a
man
seated
with
his
legs
crossed
by
the
side
of
the
river
the
man
was
naked
his
hair
and
beard
were
quite
white
and
his
body
redder
than
brick
paphnutius
felt
sure
this
must
be
the
hermit
he
saluted
him
with
the
words
the
monks
are
accustomed
to
use
when
they
meet
each
other
peace
be
with
you
brother
may
you
some
day
taste
the
sweet
joys
of
the
man
did
not
reply
he
remained
motionless
and
appeared
not
to
have
heard
paphnutius
supposed
this
was
due
to
one
of
those
rhapsodies
to
which
the
saints
are
accustomed
he
knelt
down
with
his
hands
joined
by
the
side
of
the
unknown
and
remained
thus
in
prayer
till
sunset
then
seeing
that
his
companion
had
not
moved
he
said
to
him
father
if
you
are
now
out
of
the
ecstasy
in
which
you
were
lost
give
me
your
blessing
in
our
lord
jesus
the
other
replied
without
turning
his
head
stranger
i
understand
you
not
and
i
know
not
the
lord
jesus
what
cried
paphnutius
the
prophets
have
announced
him
legions
of
martyrs
have
confessed
his
name
caesar
himself
has
worshipped
him
and
but
just
now
i
made
the
sphinx
of
silsile
proclaim
his
glory
is
it
possible
that
you
do
not
know
him
friend
replied
the
other
it
is
possible
it
would
even
be
certain
if
anything
in
this
world
were
paphnutius
was
surprised
and
saddened
by
the
incredible
ignorance
of
the
man
if
you
know
not
jesus
christ
he
said
all
your
works
serve
no
purpose
and
you
will
never
rise
to
life
the
old
man
replied
it
is
useless
to
act
or
to
abstain
from
acting
it
matters
not
whether
we
live
or
eh
what
asked
paphnutius
do
you
not
desire
to
live
through
all
eternity
but
tell
me
do
you
not
live
in
a
hut
in
the
desert
as
the
hermits
do
it
seems
do
i
not
see
you
naked
and
lacking
all
things
it
seems
do
you
not
feed
on
roots
and
live
in
chastity
it
seems
have
you
not
renounced
all
the
vanities
of
this
world
i
have
truly
renounced
all
those
vain
things
for
which
men
commonly
then
you
are
like
me
poor
chaste
and
solitary
and
you
are
not
so
as
i
am
for
the
love
of
god
and
with
a
hope
of
celestial
happiness
that
i
can
not
understand
why
are
you
virtuous
if
you
do
not
believe
in
jesus
christ
why
deprive
yourself
of
the
good
things
of
this
world
if
you
do
not
hope
to
gain
eternal
riches
in
heaven
stranger
i
deprive
myself
of
nothing
which
is
good
and
i
flatter
myself
that
i
have
found
a
life
which
is
satisfactory
enough
though
to
speak
more
precisely
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
good
or
evil
life
nothing
is
itself
either
virtuous
or
shameful
just
or
unjust
pleasant
or
painful
good
or
bad
it
is
our
opinion
which
gives
those
qualities
to
things
as
salt
gives
savour
to
so
then
according
to
you
there
is
no
certainty
you
deny
the
truth
which
the
idolaters
themselves
have
sought
you
lie
in
ignorance
like
a
tired
dog
sleeping
in
the
stranger
it
is
equally
useless
to
abuse
either
dogs
or
philosophers
we
know
not
what
dogs
are
or
what
we
are
we
know
old
man
do
you
belong
then
to
the
absurd
sect
of
sceptics
are
you
one
of
those
miserable
fools
who
alike
deny
movement
and
rest
and
who
know
not
how
to
distinguish
between
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
shadows
of
night
friend
i
am
truly
a
sceptic
and
of
a
sect
which
appears
praiseworthy
to
me
though
it
seems
ridiculous
to
you
for
the
same
things
often
assume
different
appearances
the
pyramids
of
memphis
seem
at
sunrise
to
be
cones
of
pink
light
at
sunset
they
look
like
black
triangles
against
the
illuminated
sky
but
who
shall
solve
the
problem
of
their
true
nature
you
reproach
me
with
denying
appearances
when
in
fact
appearances
are
the
only
realities
i
recognise
the
sun
seems
to
me
illuminous
but
its
nature
is
unknown
to
me
i
feel
that
fire
burns
but
i
know
not
how
or
why
my
friend
you
understand
me
badly
besides
it
is
indifferent
to
me
whether
i
am
understood
one
way
or
the
once
more
why
do
you
live
on
dates
and
onions
in
the
desert
why
do
you
endure
great
hardships
i
endure
hardships
equally
great
and
like
you
i
live
in
abstinence
and
solitude
but
then
it
is
to
please
god
and
to
earn
eternal
happiness
and
that
is
a
reasonable
object
for
it
is
wise
to
suffer
now
for
a
future
gain
it
is
senseless
on
the
contrary
to
expose
yourself
voluntarily
to
useless
fatigue
and
vain
sufferings
if
i
did
not
believe
pardon
my
blasphemy
o
uncreated
light
if
i
did
not
believe
in
the
truth
of
that
which
god
has
taught
us
by
the
voice
of
the
prophets
by
the
example
of
his
son
by
the
acts
of
the
apostles
by
the
authority
of
councils
and
by
the
testimony
of
the
martyrs
if
i
did
not
know
that
the
sufferings
of
the
body
are
necessary
for
the
salvation
of
the
soul
if
i
were
like
thee
lost
in
ignorance
of
sacred
mysteries
i
would
return
at
once
amongst
the
men
of
this
day
i
would
strive
to
acquire
riches
that
i
might
live
in
ease
like
those
who
are
happy
in
this
world
and
i
would
say
to
the
votaries
of
pleasure
come
my
daughters
come
my
servants
come
and
pour
out
for
me
your
wines
your
philtres
your
but
you
foolish
old
man
you
deprive
yourself
of
all
these
advantages
you
lose
without
hope
of
any
gain
you
give
without
hope
of
any
return
and
you
imitate
foolishly
the
noble
deeds
of
us
anchorites
as
an
impudent
monkey
thinks
by
smearing
a
wall
to
copy
the
picture
of
a
clever
artist
what
then
are
your
reasons
o
most
besotted
of
men
paphnutius
spoke
with
violence
and
indignation
but
the
old
man
remained
unmoved
friend
he
replied
gently
what
matter
the
reasons
of
a
dog
sleeping
in
the
dirt
or
a
mischievous
ape
paphnutius
only
aim
was
the
glory
of
god
his
anger
vanished
and
he
apologised
with
noble
humility
pardon
me
old
man
my
brother
he
said
if
zeal
for
the
truth
has
carried
me
beyond
proper
bounds
god
is
my
witness
that
it
is
thy
errors
and
not
thyself
that
i
hate
i
suffer
to
see
thee
in
darkness
for
i
love
thee
in
jesus
christ
and
care
for
thy
salvation
fills
my
heart
speak
give
me
your
reasons
i
long
to
know
them
that
i
may
refute
the
old
man
replied
quietly
it
is
the
same
to
me
whether
i
speak
or
remain
silent
i
will
give
my
reasons
without
asking
yours
in
return
for
i
have
no
interest
in
you
at
all
i
care
neither
for
your
happiness
nor
your
misfortune
and
it
matters
not
to
me
whether
you
think
one
way
or
another
why
should
i
love
you
or
hate
you
aversion
and
sympathy
are
equally
unworthy
of
the
wise
man
but
since
you
question
me
know
then
that
i
am
named
timocles
and
that
i
was
born
at
cos
of
parents
made
rich
by
commerce
my
father
was
a
shipowner
in
intelligence
he
much
resembled
alexander
who
is
surnamed
the
great
but
he
was
not
so
gross
in
short
he
was
a
man
of
no
great
parts
i
had
two
brothers
who
like
him
were
shipowners
as
for
me
i
followed
wisdom
my
eldest
brother
was
compelled
by
my
father
to
marry
a
carian
woman
named
timaessa
who
displeased
him
so
greatly
that
he
could
not
live
with
her
without
falling
into
a
deep
melancholy
however
timaessa
inspired
our
younger
brother
with
a
criminal
passion
and
this
passion
soon
turned
to
a
furious
madness
the
carian
woman
hated
them
both
equally
but
she
loved
a
and
received
him
at
night
in
her
chamber
one
morning
he
left
there
the
wreath
which
he
usually
wore
at
feasts
my
two
brothers
having
found
this
wreath
swore
to
kill
the
and
the
next
day
they
caused
him
to
perish
under
the
lash
in
spite
of
his
tears
and
prayers
my
felt
such
grief
that
she
lost
her
reason
and
these
three
poor
wretches
became
beasts
rather
than
human
beings
and
wandered
insane
along
the
shores
of
cos
howling
like
wolves
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
hooted
at
by
the
children
who
threw
shells
and
stones
at
them
they
died
and
my
father
buried
them
with
his
own
hands
a
little
later
his
stomach
refused
all
nourishment
and
he
died
of
hunger
though
he
was
rich
enough
to
have
bought
all
the
meats
and
fruits
in
the
markets
of
asia
he
was
deeply
grieved
at
having
to
leave
me
his
fortune
i
used
it
in
travels
i
visited
italy
greece
and
africa
without
meeting
a
single
person
who
was
either
wise
or
happy
i
studied
philosophy
at
athens
and
alexandria
and
was
deafened
by
noisy
arguments
at
last
i
wandered
as
far
as
india
and
i
saw
on
the
banks
of
the
ganges
a
naked
man
who
had
sat
there
motionless
with
his
legs
crossed
for
more
than
thirty
years
climbing
plants
twined
round
his
dried
up
body
and
the
birds
built
their
nests
in
his
hair
yet
he
lived
at
the
sight
of
him
i
called
to
mind
timaessa
the
my
two
brothers
and
my
father
and
i
realised
that
this
indian
was
a
wise
man
men
i
said
to
myself
suffer
because
they
are
deprived
of
that
which
they
believe
to
be
good
or
because
possessing
it
they
fear
to
lose
it
or
because
they
endure
that
which
they
believe
to
be
an
evil
put
an
end
to
all
beliefs
of
this
kind
and
the
evils
would
that
is
why
i
resolved
henceforth
to
deem
nothing
an
advantage
to
tear
myself
entirely
from
the
good
things
of
this
world
and
to
live
silent
and
motionless
like
the
paphnutius
had
listened
attentively
to
the
old
man
s
story
timocles
of
cos
he
replied
i
own
that
your
discourse
is
not
wholly
devoid
of
sense
it
is
in
truth
wise
to
despise
the
riches
of
this
world
but
it
would
be
absurd
to
despise
also
your
eternal
welfare
and
render
yourself
liable
to
be
visited
by
the
wrath
of
god
i
grieve
at
your
ignorance
timocles
and
i
will
instruct
you
in
the
truth
in
order
that
knowing
that
there
really
exists
a
god
in
three
hypostases
you
may
obey
this
god
as
a
child
obeys
its
timocles
interrupted
him
refrain
stranger
from
showing
me
your
doctrines
and
do
not
imagine
that
you
will
persuade
me
to
share
your
opinions
all
discussions
are
useless
my
opinion
is
to
have
no
opinion
my
life
is
devoid
of
trouble
because
i
have
no
preferences
go
thy
ways
and
strive
not
to
withdraw
me
from
the
beneficent
apathy
in
which
i
am
plunged
as
though
in
a
delicious
bath
after
the
hardships
of
my
past
paphnutius
was
profoundly
instructed
in
all
things
relating
to
the
faith
by
his
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
he
was
aware
that
the
grace
of
god
had
not
fallen
on
old
timocles
and
the
day
of
salvation
for
this
soul
so
obstinately
resolved
to
ruin
itself
had
not
yet
come
he
did
not
reply
lest
the
power
given
for
edification
should
turn
to
destruction
for
it
sometimes
happens
in
disputing
with
infidels
that
the
means
used
for
their
conversion
may
steep
them
still
farther
in
sin
therefore
they
who
possess
the
truth
should
take
care
how
they
spread
it
farewell
then
unhappy
timocles
he
said
and
heaving
a
deep
sigh
he
resumed
his
pious
pilgrimage
through
the
night
in
the
morning
he
saw
the
ibises
motionless
on
one
leg
at
the
edge
of
the
water
which
reflected
their
pale
pink
necks
the
willows
stretched
their
soft
grey
foliage
to
the
bank
cranes
flew
in
a
triangle
in
the
clear
sky
and
the
cry
of
unseen
herons
was
heard
from
the
sedges
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
river
rolled
its
broad
green
waters
o
er
which
white
sails
like
the
wings
of
birds
glided
and
here
and
there
on
the
shores
a
white
house
shone
out
a
light
mist
floated
along
the
banks
and
from
out
the
shadow
of
the
islands
which
were
laden
with
palms
flowers
and
fruits
came
noisy
flocks
of
ducks
geese
flamingoes
and
teal
to
the
left
the
grassy
valley
extended
to
the
desert
its
fields
and
orchards
in
joyful
abundance
the
sun
shone
on
the
yellow
wheat
and
the
earth
exhaled
forth
its
fecundity
in
odorous
wafts
at
this
sight
paphnutius
fell
on
his
knees
and
cried
blessed
be
the
lord
who
has
given
a
happy
issue
to
my
journey
o
god
who
spreadest
thy
dew
upon
the
fig
trees
of
the
arsiniote
pour
thy
grace
upon
thais
whom
thou
hast
formed
with
thy
love
as
thou
hast
the
flowers
and
trees
of
the
field
may
she
by
thy
loving
care
flourish
like
a
rose
in
the
heavenly
and
every
time
that
he
saw
a
tree
covered
with
blossom
or
a
bird
of
brilliant
plumage
he
thought
of
thais
keeping
along
the
left
arm
of
the
river
and
through
a
fertile
and
populous
district
he
reached
in
a
few
days
the
city
of
alexandria
which
the
greeks
have
surnamed
the
beautiful
and
the
golden
the
sun
had
risen
an
hour
when
he
beheld
from
the
top
of
a
hill
the
vast
city
the
roofs
of
which
glittered
in
the
rosy
light
he
stopped
and
folded
his
arms
on
his
breast
there
then
he
said
is
the
delightful
spot
where
i
was
born
in
sin
the
bright
air
where
i
breathed
poisonous
perfumes
the
sea
of
pleasure
where
i
heard
the
songs
of
the
sirens
there
is
my
cradle
after
the
flesh
my
native
land
in
the
parlance
of
the
men
of
these
days
a
rich
cradle
an
illustrious
country
in
the
judgment
of
men
it
is
natural
that
thy
children
should
reverence
thee
like
a
mother
alexandria
and
i
was
begotten
in
thy
magnificently
adorned
breast
but
the
ascetic
despises
nature
the
mystic
scorns
appearances
the
christian
regards
his
native
land
as
a
place
of
exile
the
monk
is
not
of
this
earth
i
have
turned
away
my
heart
from
loving
thee
alexandria
i
hate
thee
i
hate
thee
for
thy
riches
thy
science
thy
pleasures
and
thy
beauty
be
accursed
temple
of
demons
lewd
couch
of
the
gentiles
tainted
pulpit
of
arian
heresy
be
thou
accursed
and
thou
winged
son
of
heaven
who
led
the
holy
hermit
anthony
our
father
when
he
came
from
the
depths
of
the
desert
and
entered
into
the
citadel
of
idolatry
to
strengthen
the
faith
of
believers
and
the
confidence
of
martyrs
beautiful
angel
of
the
lord
invisible
child
first
breath
of
god
fly
thou
before
me
and
cleanse
by
the
beating
of
thy
wings
the
corrupted
air
i
am
about
to
breathe
amongst
the
princes
of
darkness
of
this
world
having
thus
spoken
he
resumed
his
journey
he
entered
the
city
by
the
gate
of
the
sun
this
gate
was
a
handsome
structure
of
stone
in
the
shadow
of
its
arch
crowded
some
poor
wretches
who
offered
lemons
and
figs
for
sale
or
with
many
groans
and
lamentations
begged
for
an
obolus
an
old
woman
in
rags
who
was
kneeling
there
seized
the
monk
s
cassock
kissed
it
and
said
man
of
the
lord
bless
me
that
god
may
bless
me
i
have
suffered
many
things
in
this
world
that
i
may
have
joys
in
the
world
to
come
you
come
from
god
o
holy
man
and
that
is
why
the
dust
of
your
feet
is
more
precious
than
the
lord
be
praised
said
paphnutius
and
with
his
hand
he
made
the
sign
of
redemption
on
the
old
woman
s
head
but
hardly
had
he
gone
twenty
paces
down
the
street
than
a
band
of
children
began
to
jeer
at
him
and
throw
stones
crying
oh
the
wicked
monk
he
is
blacker
than
an
ape
and
more
bearded
than
a
goat
he
is
a
skulker
why
not
hang
him
in
an
orchard
like
a
wooden
priapus
to
frighten
the
birds
but
no
he
would
draw
down
the
hail
on
the
he
brings
bad
luck
to
the
ravens
with
the
monk
to
the
ravens
and
stones
mingled
with
the
cries
my
god
bless
these
poor
children
murmured
paphnutius
and
he
pursued
his
way
thinking
i
was
worshipped
by
the
old
woman
and
hated
and
despised
by
these
children
thus
the
same
object
is
appreciated
differently
by
men
who
are
uncertain
in
their
judgment
and
liable
to
error
it
must
be
owned
that
for
a
gentile
old
timocles
was
not
devoid
of
sense
though
blind
he
knew
he
was
deprived
of
light
his
reasoning
was
much
better
than
that
of
these
idolaters
who
cry
from
the
depths
of
their
thick
darkness
i
see
the
day
everything
in
this
world
is
mirage
and
moving
sand
god
alone
is
he
passed
through
the
city
with
rapid
steps
after
ten
years
of
absence
he
would
still
recognise
every
stone
and
every
stone
was
to
him
a
stone
of
reproach
that
recalled
a
sin
for
that
reason
he
struck
his
naked
feet
roughly
against
the
of
the
wide
street
and
rejoiced
to
see
the
bloody
marks
of
his
wounded
feet
leaving
on
his
left
the
magnificent
portico
of
the
temple
of
serapis
he
entered
a
road
lined
with
splendid
mansions
which
seemed
to
be
drowsy
with
perfumes
pines
maples
and
larches
raised
their
heads
above
the
red
cornices
and
golden
acroteria
through
the
doors
could
be
seen
bronze
statues
in
marble
vestibules
and
fountains
playing
amidst
foliage
no
noise
troubled
the
stillness
of
these
quiet
retreats
only
the
distant
strains
of
a
flute
could
be
heard
the
monk
stopped
before
a
house
rather
small
but
of
noble
proportions
and
supported
by
columns
as
graceful
as
young
girls
it
was
ornamented
with
bronze
busts
of
the
most
celebrated
greek
philosophers
he
recognised
plato
socrates
aristotle
epicurus
and
zeno
and
having
knocked
with
the
hammer
against
the
door
he
waited
wrapped
in
meditation
it
is
vanity
to
glorify
in
metal
these
false
sages
their
lies
are
confounded
their
souls
are
lost
in
hell
and
even
the
famous
plato
himself
who
filled
the
earth
with
his
eloquence
now
disputes
with
the
a
slave
opened
the
door
and
seeing
a
man
with
bare
feet
standing
on
the
mosaic
threshold
said
to
him
roughly
go
and
beg
elsewhere
stupid
monk
or
i
will
drive
you
away
with
a
brother
replied
the
abbott
of
antinoe
all
that
i
ask
is
that
you
conduct
me
to
your
master
the
slave
replied
more
angrily
than
before
my
master
does
not
see
dogs
like
my
son
said
paphnutius
will
you
please
do
what
i
ask
and
tell
your
master
that
i
desire
to
see
him
get
out
vile
beggar
cried
the
porter
furiously
and
he
raised
his
stick
and
struck
the
holy
man
who
with
his
arms
crossed
upon
his
breast
received
unmovedly
the
blow
which
fell
full
in
his
face
and
then
repeated
gently
do
as
i
ask
you
my
son
i
the
porter
tremblingly
murmured
who
is
this
man
who
is
not
afraid
of
suffering
and
he
ran
and
told
his
master
nicias
had
just
left
the
bath
two
pretty
slave
girls
were
scraping
him
with
strigils
he
was
a
man
with
a
kind
smile
there
was
an
expression
of
gentle
satire
in
his
face
on
seeing
the
monk
he
rose
and
advanced
with
open
arms
it
is
you
he
cried
paphnutius
my
my
friend
my
brother
oh
i
knew
you
again
though
to
say
the
truth
you
look
more
like
a
wild
animal
than
a
man
embrace
me
do
you
remember
the
time
when
we
studied
grammar
rhetoric
and
philosophy
together
you
were
even
then
of
a
morose
and
wild
character
but
i
liked
you
because
of
your
complete
sincerity
we
used
to
say
that
you
looked
at
the
universe
with
the
eyes
of
a
wild
horse
and
it
was
not
surprising
you
were
dull
and
moody
you
needed
a
pinch
of
attic
salt
but
your
liberality
knew
no
bounds
you
cared
nothing
for
either
your
money
or
your
life
and
you
had
the
eccentricity
of
genius
and
a
strange
character
which
interested
me
deeply
you
are
welcome
my
dear
paphnutius
after
ten
years
of
absence
you
have
quitted
the
desert
you
have
renounced
all
christian
superstitions
and
now
return
to
your
old
life
i
will
mark
this
day
with
a
white
crobyle
and
myrtale
he
added
turning
towards
the
girls
perfume
the
feet
hands
and
beard
of
my
dear
they
smiled
and
had
already
brought
the
basin
the
phials
and
the
metal
mirror
but
paphnutius
stopped
them
with
an
imperious
gesture
and
lowered
his
eyes
that
he
might
not
look
upon
them
for
they
were
naked
nicias
brought
cushions
for
him
and
offered
him
various
meats
and
drinks
which
paphnutius
scornfully
refused
nicias
he
said
i
have
not
renounced
what
you
falsely
call
the
christian
superstition
which
is
the
truth
of
truths
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
god
all
things
were
made
by
him
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
was
made
in
him
was
the
life
and
the
life
was
the
light
of
my
dear
paphnutius
replied
nicias
who
had
now
put
on
a
perfumed
tunic
do
you
expect
to
astonish
me
by
reciting
a
lot
of
words
jumbled
together
without
skill
which
are
no
more
than
a
vain
murmur
have
you
forgotten
that
i
am
a
bit
of
a
philosopher
myself
and
do
you
think
to
satisfy
me
with
some
rags
torn
by
ignorant
men
from
the
purple
garment
of
aemilius
when
aemilius
porphyry
and
plato
in
all
their
glory
did
not
satisfy
me
the
systems
devised
by
the
sages
are
but
tales
imagined
to
amuse
the
eternal
childishness
of
men
we
divert
ourselves
with
them
as
we
do
with
the
stories
of
and
ephesian
or
any
other
milesian
and
taking
his
guest
by
the
arm
he
led
him
into
a
room
where
thousands
of
papyri
were
rolled
up
and
lay
in
baskets
this
is
my
library
he
said
it
contains
a
small
part
of
the
various
systems
which
the
philosophers
have
constructed
to
explain
the
world
the
serapeium
itself
with
all
its
riches
does
not
contain
them
all
alas
they
are
but
the
dreams
of
sick
he
compelled
his
guest
to
sit
down
in
an
ivory
chair
and
sat
down
himself
paphnutius
scowled
gloomily
at
all
the
books
in
the
library
and
said
they
ought
all
to
be
oh
my
dear
guest
that
would
be
a
pity
replied
nicias
for
the
dreams
of
sick
men
are
sometimes
amusing
besides
if
we
should
destroy
all
the
dreams
and
visions
of
men
the
earth
would
lose
its
form
and
colours
and
we
should
all
sleep
in
a
dull
paphnutius
continued
in
the
same
strain
as
before
it
is
certain
that
the
doctrines
of
the
pagans
are
but
vain
lies
but
god
who
is
the
truth
revealed
himself
to
men
by
miracles
and
he
was
made
flesh
and
lived
among
nicias
replied
you
speak
well
my
dear
paphnutius
when
you
say
that
he
was
made
flesh
a
god
who
thinks
acts
speaks
who
wanders
through
nature
like
ulysses
of
old
on
the
glaucous
sea
is
altogether
a
man
how
do
you
expect
that
we
should
believe
in
this
new
jupiter
when
the
urchins
of
athens
in
the
time
of
pericles
no
longer
believed
in
the
old
one
but
let
us
leave
all
that
you
did
not
come
here
i
suppose
to
argue
about
the
three
hypostases
what
can
i
do
for
you
my
dear
a
good
deed
replied
the
abbot
of
antinoe
lend
me
a
perfumed
tunic
like
the
one
you
have
just
put
on
be
kind
enough
to
add
to
the
tunic
gilt
sandals
and
a
vial
of
oil
to
anoint
my
beard
and
hair
it
is
needful
also
that
you
should
give
me
a
purse
with
a
thousand
drachmae
in
it
that
o
nicias
is
what
i
came
to
ask
of
you
for
the
love
of
god
and
in
remembrance
of
our
old
nicias
made
crobyle
and
myrtale
bring
his
richest
tunic
it
was
embroidered
after
the
asiatic
fashion
with
flowers
and
animals
the
two
girls
held
it
open
and
skilfully
showed
its
bright
colours
waiting
till
paphnutius
should
have
taken
off
the
cassock
which
covered
him
down
to
his
feet
but
the
monk
having
declared
that
they
should
rather
tear
off
his
flesh
than
this
garment
they
put
on
the
tunic
over
it
as
the
two
girls
were
pretty
they
were
not
afraid
of
men
although
they
were
slaves
they
laughed
at
the
strange
appearance
of
the
monk
thus
clad
crobyle
called
him
her
dear
satrap
as
she
presented
him
with
the
mirror
and
myrtale
pulled
his
beard
but
paphnutius
prayed
to
the
lord
and
did
not
look
at
them
having
tied
on
the
gilt
sandals
and
fastened
the
purse
to
his
belt
he
said
to
nicias
who
was
looking
at
him
with
an
amused
expression
o
nicias
let
not
these
things
be
an
offence
in
your
eyes
for
know
that
i
shall
make
pious
use
of
this
tunic
this
purse
and
these
my
dear
friend
replied
nicias
i
suspect
no
evil
for
i
believe
that
men
are
equally
incapable
of
doing
evil
or
doing
good
good
and
evil
exist
only
in
the
opinion
the
wise
man
has
only
custom
and
usage
to
guide
him
in
his
acts
i
conform
with
all
the
prejudices
which
prevail
at
alexandria
that
is
why
i
pass
for
an
honest
man
go
friend
and
enjoy
but
paphnutius
thought
that
it
was
needful
to
inform
his
host
of
his
intention
do
you
know
thais
he
said
who
acts
in
the
games
at
the
theatre
she
is
beautiful
replied
nicias
and
there
was
a
time
when
she
was
dear
to
me
for
her
sake
i
sold
a
mill
and
two
fields
of
corn
and
i
composed
in
her
honour
three
books
full
of
detestably
bad
verses
surely
beauty
is
the
most
powerful
force
in
the
world
and
were
we
so
made
that
we
could
possess
it
always
we
should
care
as
little
as
may
be
for
the
demiurgos
the
logos
the
aeons
and
all
the
other
reveries
of
the
philosophers
but
i
am
surprised
my
good
paphnutius
that
you
should
have
come
from
the
depths
of
the
thebaid
to
talk
about
having
said
this
he
sighed
gently
and
paphnutius
gazed
at
him
with
horror
not
conceiving
it
possible
that
a
man
should
so
calmly
avow
such
a
sin
he
expected
to
see
the
earth
open
and
nicias
swallowed
up
in
flames
but
the
earth
remained
solid
and
the
alexandrian
silent
his
forehead
resting
on
his
hand
and
he
smiling
sadly
at
the
memories
of
his
past
youth
the
monk
rose
and
continued
in
solemn
tones
know
then
o
nicias
that
with
the
aid
of
god
i
will
snatch
this
woman
thais
from
the
unclean
affections
of
the
world
and
give
her
as
a
spouse
to
jesus
christ
if
the
holy
spirit
does
not
forsake
me
thais
will
leave
this
city
and
enter
a
beware
of
offending
venus
replied
nicias
she
is
a
powerful
goddess
she
will
be
angry
with
you
if
you
take
away
her
chief
god
will
protect
me
said
paphnutius
may
he
also
illumine
thy
heart
o
nicias
and
draw
thee
out
of
the
abyss
in
which
thou
art
and
he
stalked
out
of
the
room
but
nicias
followed
him
and
overtook
him
on
the
threshold
and
placing
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
whispered
into
his
ear
the
same
words
beware
of
offending
venus
her
vengeance
is
paphnutius
disdainful
of
these
trivial
words
left
without
turning
his
head
he
felt
only
contempt
for
nicias
but
what
he
could
not
bear
was
the
idea
that
his
former
friend
had
received
the
caresses
of
thais
it
seemed
to
him
that
to
sin
with
that
woman
was
more
detestable
than
to
sin
with
any
other
to
him
this
appeared
the
height
of
iniquity
and
he
henceforth
looked
upon
nicias
as
an
object
of
execration
he
had
always
hated
impurity
but
never
before
had
this
vice
appeared
so
heinous
to
him
never
before
had
it
so
seemed
to
merit
the
anger
of
jesus
christ
and
the
sorrow
of
the
angels
he
felt
only
a
more
ardent
desire
to
save
thais
from
the
gentiles
and
that
he
must
hasten
to
see
the
actress
in
order
to
save
her
nevertheless
before
he
could
enter
her
house
he
must
wait
till
the
heat
of
the
day
was
over
and
now
the
morning
had
hardly
finished
paphnutius
wandered
through
the
most
frequented
streets
he
had
resolved
to
take
no
food
that
day
in
order
to
be
the
less
unworthy
of
the
favours
he
had
asked
of
the
lord
to
the
great
grief
of
his
soul
he
dared
not
enter
any
of
the
churches
in
the
city
because
he
knew
they
were
profaned
by
the
arians
who
had
overturned
the
lord
s
table
for
in
fact
these
heretics
supported
by
the
emperor
of
the
east
had
driven
the
patriarch
athanasius
from
his
episcopate
and
sown
trouble
and
confusion
among
the
christians
of
alexandria
he
therefore
wandered
about
aimlessly
sometimes
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
in
humility
and
sometimes
raised
to
heaven
in
ecstasy
after
some
time
he
found
himself
on
the
quay
before
him
lay
the
harbour
in
which
were
sheltered
innumerable
ships
and
galleys
and
beyond
them
smiling
in
blue
and
silver
lay
the
perfidious
sea
a
galley
which
bore
a
nereid
at
its
prow
had
just
weighed
anchor
the
rowers
sang
as
the
oars
struck
the
water
and
already
the
white
daughter
of
the
waters
covered
with
humid
pearls
showed
no
more
than
a
flying
profile
to
the
monk
steered
by
her
pilot
she
cleared
the
passage
leading
from
the
basin
of
the
eunostos
and
gained
the
high
seas
leaving
a
glittering
trail
behind
her
i
also
thought
paphnutius
once
desired
to
embark
singing
on
the
ocean
of
the
world
but
i
soon
saw
my
folly
and
the
nereid
did
not
carry
me
lost
in
his
thoughts
he
sat
down
upon
a
coil
of
rope
and
went
to
sleep
during
his
sleep
he
had
a
vision
he
seemed
to
hear
the
sound
of
a
clanging
trumpet
and
the
sky
became
blood
red
and
he
knew
that
the
day
of
judgment
had
come
whilst
he
was
fervently
praying
to
god
he
saw
an
enormous
monster
coming
towards
him
bearing
on
its
forehead
a
cross
of
light
and
he
recognised
the
sphinx
of
silsile
the
monster
seized
him
between
its
teeth
without
hurting
him
and
carried
him
in
its
mouth
as
a
cat
carries
a
kitten
paphnutius
was
thus
conveyed
across
many
countries
crossing
rivers
and
traversing
mountains
and
came
at
last
to
a
desert
place
covered
with
scowling
rocks
and
hot
cinders
the
ground
was
rent
in
many
places
and
through
these
openings
came
a
hot
air
the
monster
gently
put
paphnutius
down
on
the
ground
and
said
look
and
paphnutius
leaning
over
the
edge
of
the
abyss
saw
a
river
of
fire
which
flowed
in
the
interior
of
the
earth
between
two
cliffs
of
black
rocks
there
in
a
livid
light
the
demons
tormented
the
souls
of
the
damned
the
souls
preserved
the
appearance
of
the
bodies
which
had
held
them
and
even
wore
some
rags
of
clothing
these
souls
seemed
peaceful
in
the
midst
of
their
torments
one
of
them
tall
and
white
his
eyes
closed
a
white
fillet
across
his
forehead
and
a
sceptre
in
his
hand
sang
his
voice
filled
the
desert
shores
with
harmony
he
sang
of
gods
and
heroes
little
green
devils
pierced
his
lips
and
throat
with
irons
and
the
shade
of
homer
still
sang
near
by
old
anaxagoras
bald
and
hoary
traced
figures
in
the
dust
with
a
compass
a
demon
poured
boiling
oil
into
his
ear
yet
failed
however
to
disturb
the
sage
s
meditations
and
the
monk
saw
many
other
persons
who
on
the
dark
shore
by
the
side
of
the
burning
river
read
or
quietly
meditated
or
conversed
with
other
spirits
while
walking
like
the
sages
and
pupils
under
the
shadow
of
the
sycamore
trees
of
academe
old
timocles
alone
had
withdrawn
from
the
others
and
shook
his
head
like
a
man
who
denies
one
of
the
demons
of
the
abyss
shook
a
torch
before
his
eyes
but
timocles
would
see
neither
the
demon
nor
the
torch
mute
with
surprise
at
this
spectacle
paphnutius
turned
to
the
monster
it
had
disappeared
and
in
place
of
the
sphinx
the
monk
saw
a
veiled
woman
who
said
look
and
understand
such
is
the
obstinacy
of
these
infidels
that
even
in
hell
they
remain
victims
of
the
illusions
which
deluded
them
when
on
earth
death
has
not
undeceived
them
for
it
is
very
plain
that
it
does
not
suffice
merely
to
die
in
order
to
see
god
those
who
are
ignorant
of
the
truth
whilst
living
will
be
ignorant
of
it
always
the
demons
which
are
busy
torturing
these
souls
what
are
they
but
agents
of
divine
justice
that
is
why
these
souls
neither
see
them
nor
feel
them
they
were
ignorant
of
the
truth
and
therefore
unaware
of
their
own
condemnation
and
god
himself
can
not
compel
them
to
suffer
god
can
do
all
things
said
the
abbot
of
antinoe
he
can
not
do
that
which
is
absurd
replied
the
veiled
woman
to
punish
them
they
must
first
be
enlightened
and
if
they
possessed
the
truth
they
would
be
like
unto
the
vexed
and
horrified
paphnutius
again
bent
over
the
edge
of
the
abyss
he
saw
the
shade
of
nicias
smiling
with
a
wreath
of
flowers
on
his
head
sitting
under
a
burnt
myrtle
tree
by
his
side
was
aspasia
of
miletus
gracefully
draped
in
a
woollen
cloak
and
they
seemed
to
talk
together
of
love
and
philosophy
the
expression
of
her
face
was
sweet
and
noble
the
rain
of
fire
which
fell
on
them
was
as
a
refreshing
dew
and
their
feet
pressed
the
burning
soil
as
though
it
had
been
tender
grass
at
this
sight
paphnutius
was
filled
with
fury
strike
him
o
god
strike
him
he
cried
it
is
nicias
let
him
weep
let
him
groan
let
him
grind
his
teeth
he
sinned
with
thais
and
paphnutius
woke
in
the
arms
of
a
sailor
as
strong
as
hercules
who
cried
quietly
quietly
my
friend
by
proteus
the
old
shepherd
of
the
seals
you
slumber
uneasily
if
i
had
not
caught
hold
of
you
you
would
have
tumbled
into
the
eunostos
it
is
as
true
as
that
my
mother
sold
salt
fish
that
i
saved
your
i
thank
god
replied
paphnutius
and
rising
to
his
feet
he
walked
straight
before
him
meditating
on
the
vision
which
had
come
to
him
whilst
he
was
asleep
this
vision
he
said
to
himself
is
plainly
an
evil
one
it
is
an
insult
to
divine
goodness
to
imagine
hell
is
unreal
the
dream
certainly
came
from
the
he
reasoned
thus
because
he
knew
how
to
distinguish
between
the
dreams
sent
by
god
and
those
produced
by
evil
angels
such
discernment
is
useful
to
the
hermit
who
lives
surrounded
by
apparitions
and
who
in
avoiding
men
is
sure
to
meet
with
spirits
the
deserts
are
full
of
phantoms
when
the
pilgrims
drew
near
the
ruined
castle
to
which
the
holy
hermit
anthony
had
retired
they
heard
a
noise
like
that
which
goes
up
from
the
public
square
of
a
large
city
at
a
great
festival
the
noise
was
made
by
the
devils
who
were
tempting
the
holy
man
paphnutius
remembered
this
memorable
example
he
also
called
to
mind
john
the
egyptian
who
for
sixty
years
was
tempted
by
the
devil
but
john
saw
through
all
the
tricks
of
the
demon
one
day
however
the
devil
having
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
man
entered
the
grotto
of
the
venerable
john
and
said
to
him
john
you
must
continue
to
fast
until
and
john
believing
that
it
was
an
angel
who
spoke
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
demon
and
fasted
the
next
day
until
the
vesper
hour
that
was
the
only
victory
that
the
prince
of
darkness
ever
gained
over
john
the
egyptian
and
that
was
but
a
trifling
one
it
was
therefore
not
astonishing
that
paphnutius
knew
at
once
that
the
vision
which
had
visited
him
in
his
sleep
was
an
evil
one
whilst
he
was
gently
remonstrating
with
god
for
having
given
him
into
the
power
of
the
demons
he
felt
himself
pushed
and
dragged
amidst
a
crowd
of
people
who
were
all
hurrying
in
the
same
direction
as
he
was
unaccustomed
to
walk
in
the
streets
of
a
city
he
was
shoved
and
knocked
from
one
passer
to
another
like
an
inert
mass
and
being
embarrassed
by
the
folds
of
his
tunic
he
was
more
than
once
on
the
point
of
falling
desirous
of
knowing
where
all
these
people
could
be
going
he
asked
one
of
them
the
cause
of
this
hurry
do
you
not
know
stranger
replied
he
that
the
games
are
about
to
begin
and
that
thais
will
appear
on
the
stage
all
the
citizens
are
going
to
the
theatre
and
i
also
am
going
would
you
like
to
accompany
me
it
occurred
to
him
at
once
that
it
would
further
his
design
to
see
thais
in
the
games
and
paphnutius
followed
the
stranger
in
front
of
them
stood
the
theatre
its
portico
ornamented
with
shining
masks
and
its
huge
circular
wall
covered
with
innumerable
statues
following
the
crowd
they
entered
a
narrow
passage
at
the
end
of
which
lay
the
amphitheatre
glittering
with
light
they
took
their
places
on
one
of
the
seats
which
descended
in
steps
to
the
stage
which
was
empty
but
magnificently
decorated
there
was
no
curtain
to
hide
the
view
and
on
the
stage
was
a
mound
such
as
used
to
be
erected
in
old
times
to
the
shades
of
heroes
this
mound
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
camp
lances
were
stacked
in
front
of
the
tents
and
golden
shields
hung
from
masts
amidst
boughs
of
laurel
and
wreaths
of
oak
on
the
stage
all
was
silence
but
a
murmur
like
the
humming
of
bees
in
a
hive
rose
from
the
vast
hemicycle
filled
with
spectators
all
their
faces
reddened
by
the
reflection
from
the
purple
awning
which
waved
above
them
turned
with
attentive
curiosity
towards
the
large
silent
stage
with
its
tomb
and
tents
the
women
laughed
and
ate
lemons
and
the
regular
called
gaily
to
one
another
from
their
seats
paphnutius
prayed
inwardly
and
refrained
from
uttering
any
vain
words
but
his
neighbour
began
to
complain
of
the
decline
of
the
drama
formerly
he
said
clever
actors
used
to
declaim
under
a
mask
the
verses
of
euripides
and
menander
now
they
no
longer
recite
dramas
they
act
in
dumb
show
and
of
the
divine
spectacles
with
which
bacchus
was
honoured
in
athens
we
have
kept
nothing
but
what
a
barbarian
a
scythian
even
could
understand
attitude
and
gesture
the
tragic
mask
the
mouth
of
which
was
provided
with
metal
tongues
that
increased
the
sound
of
the
voice
the
cothurnus
which
raised
the
actors
to
the
height
of
gods
the
tragic
majesty
and
the
splendid
verses
that
used
to
be
sung
have
all
gone
pantomimists
and
dancing
girls
with
bare
faces
have
replaced
paulus
and
roscius
what
would
the
athenians
of
the
days
of
pericles
have
said
if
they
had
seen
a
woman
on
the
stage
it
is
indecent
for
a
woman
to
appear
in
public
we
must
be
very
degenerate
to
permit
it
it
is
as
certain
as
that
my
name
is
dorion
that
woman
is
the
natural
enemy
of
man
and
a
disgrace
to
human
you
speak
wisely
replied
paphnutius
woman
is
our
worst
enemy
she
gives
us
pleasure
and
is
to
be
feared
on
that
by
the
immovable
gods
cried
dorion
it
is
not
pleasure
that
woman
gives
to
man
but
sadness
trouble
and
black
cares
love
is
the
cause
of
our
most
biting
evils
listen
stranger
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
visited
troezene
in
argolis
and
i
saw
there
a
myrtle
of
a
most
prodigious
size
the
leaves
of
which
were
covered
with
innumerable
pinholes
and
this
is
what
the
troezenians
say
about
that
myrtle
queen
phaedra
when
she
was
in
love
with
hippolytos
used
to
recline
idly
all
day
long
under
this
same
tree
to
beguile
the
tedium
of
her
weary
life
she
used
to
draw
out
the
golden
pin
which
held
her
fair
locks
and
pierce
with
it
the
leaves
of
the
bush
all
the
leaves
were
riddled
with
holes
after
she
had
ruined
the
poor
young
man
whom
she
pursued
with
her
incestuous
love
phaedra
as
you
know
perished
miserably
she
locked
herself
up
in
her
bridal
chamber
and
hanged
herself
by
her
golden
girdle
from
an
ivory
peg
the
gods
willed
that
the
myrtle
the
witness
of
her
bitter
misery
should
continue
to
bear
in
its
fresh
leaves
the
marks
of
the
i
picked
one
of
these
leaves
and
placed
it
at
the
head
of
my
bed
that
by
the
sight
of
it
i
might
take
warning
against
the
folly
of
love
and
conform
to
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
epicurus
my
master
who
taught
that
all
lust
is
to
be
feared
but
properly
speaking
love
is
a
disease
of
the
liver
and
one
is
never
sure
of
not
catching
the
paphnutius
asked
dorion
what
are
your
pleasures
dorion
replied
sadly
i
have
only
one
pleasure
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
it
is
not
a
very
exciting
one
it
is
meditation
when
a
man
has
a
bad
digestion
he
must
not
look
for
any
taking
advantage
of
these
words
paphnutius
proceeded
to
initiate
the
epicurean
into
those
spiritual
joys
which
the
contemplation
of
god
procures
he
began
hear
the
truth
dorion
and
receive
the
but
he
saw
then
that
all
heads
were
turned
towards
him
and
everybody
was
making
signs
for
him
to
be
quiet
dead
silence
prevailed
in
the
theatre
broken
at
last
by
the
strains
of
heroic
music
the
play
began
the
soldiers
left
their
tents
and
were
preparing
to
depart
when
a
prodigy
occurred
a
cloud
covered
the
summit
of
the
funeral
pile
then
the
cloud
rolled
away
and
the
ghost
of
achilles
appeared
clad
in
golden
armour
extending
his
arms
towards
the
warriors
he
seemed
to
say
to
them
what
do
you
depart
children
of
danaos
do
you
return
to
the
land
i
shall
never
behold
again
and
leave
my
tomb
without
any
offerings
already
the
principal
greek
chieftains
pressed
to
the
foot
of
the
pile
acamas
the
son
of
theseus
old
nestor
agamemnon
bearing
a
sceptre
and
with
a
fillet
on
his
brow
gazed
at
the
prodigy
pyrrhus
the
young
son
of
achilles
was
prostrate
in
the
dust
ulysses
recognisable
by
the
cap
which
covered
his
curly
hair
showed
by
his
gestures
that
he
acquiesced
in
the
demand
of
the
hero
s
shade
he
argued
with
agamemnon
and
their
words
might
be
easily
guessed
achilles
said
the
king
of
ithaca
is
worthy
to
be
honoured
by
us
for
he
died
gloriously
for
hellas
he
demands
that
the
daughter
of
priam
the
virgin
polyxena
should
be
immolated
on
his
tomb
greeks
appease
the
manes
of
the
hero
and
let
the
son
of
peleus
rejoice
in
but
the
king
of
kings
replied
spare
the
trojan
virgins
we
have
torn
from
the
altars
sufficient
misfortunes
have
already
fallen
on
the
illustrious
race
of
he
spoke
thus
because
he
shared
the
couch
of
the
sister
of
polyxena
and
the
wise
ulysses
reproached
him
for
preferring
the
couch
of
cassandra
to
the
lance
of
achilles
the
greeks
showed
they
shared
the
opinion
of
ulysses
by
loudly
clashing
their
weapons
the
death
of
polyxena
was
resolved
on
and
the
appeased
shade
of
achilles
vanished
the
music
sometimes
wild
and
sometimes
plaintive
followed
the
thoughts
of
the
personages
in
the
drama
the
spectators
burst
into
applause
paphnutius
who
applied
divine
truth
to
everything
murmured
this
fable
shows
how
cruel
the
worshippers
of
false
gods
all
religions
breed
crimes
replied
the
epicurean
happily
a
greek
who
was
divinely
wise
has
freed
men
from
foolish
terrors
of
the
unknown
just
at
that
moment
hecuba
her
white
hair
dishevelled
her
robe
tattered
came
out
of
the
tent
in
which
she
was
kept
captive
a
long
sigh
went
up
from
the
audience
when
her
woeful
figure
appeared
hecuba
had
been
warned
by
a
prophetic
dream
and
lamented
her
daughter
s
fate
and
her
own
ulysses
approached
her
and
asked
her
to
give
up
polyxena
the
old
mother
tore
her
hair
dug
her
nails
into
her
cheeks
and
kissed
the
hands
of
the
cruel
chieftain
who
with
unpitying
calmness
seemed
to
say
be
wise
hecuba
and
yield
to
necessity
there
are
amongst
us
many
old
mothers
who
weep
for
their
children
now
sleeping
under
the
pines
of
and
hecuba
formerly
queen
of
the
most
flourishing
city
in
asia
and
now
a
slave
bowed
her
unhappy
head
in
the
dust
then
the
curtain
in
front
of
one
of
the
tents
was
raised
and
the
virgin
polyxena
appeared
a
tremor
passed
through
all
the
spectators
they
had
recognised
thais
paphnutius
saw
again
the
woman
he
had
come
to
seek
with
her
white
arm
she
held
above
her
head
the
heavy
curtain
motionless
as
a
splendid
statue
she
stood
with
a
look
of
pride
and
resignation
in
her
violet
eyes
and
her
resplendent
beauty
made
a
shudder
of
commiseration
pass
through
all
who
beheld
her
a
murmur
of
applause
uprose
and
paphnutius
his
soul
agitated
and
pressing
both
hands
to
his
heart
sighed
why
o
my
god
hast
thou
given
this
power
to
one
of
thy
creatures
dorion
was
not
so
disturbed
he
said
certainly
the
atoms
which
have
momentarily
met
together
to
form
this
woman
present
a
combination
which
is
agreeable
to
the
eye
but
that
is
but
a
freak
of
nature
and
the
atoms
know
not
what
they
do
they
will
some
day
separate
with
the
same
indifference
as
they
came
together
where
are
now
the
atoms
which
formed
lais
or
cleopatra
i
must
confess
that
women
are
sometimes
beautiful
but
they
are
liable
to
grievous
afflictions
and
disgusting
inconveniences
that
is
patent
to
all
thinking
men
though
the
vulgar
pay
no
attention
to
it
and
women
inspire
love
though
it
is
absurd
and
ridiculous
to
love
such
were
the
thoughts
of
the
philosopher
and
the
ascetic
as
they
gazed
on
thais
they
neither
of
them
noticed
hecuba
who
turned
to
her
daughter
and
seemed
to
say
by
her
gestures
try
to
soften
the
cruel
ulysses
employ
your
tears
your
beauty
and
your
thais
or
rather
polyxena
herself
let
fall
the
curtain
of
the
tent
she
made
a
step
forward
and
all
hearts
were
conquered
and
when
with
firm
but
light
steps
she
advanced
towards
ulysses
her
rhythmic
movements
which
were
accompanied
by
the
sound
of
flutes
created
in
all
present
such
happy
visions
that
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
the
divine
centre
of
all
the
harmonies
of
the
world
all
eyes
were
bent
on
her
the
other
actors
were
obscured
by
her
effulgence
and
were
not
noticed
the
play
continued
however
the
prudent
son
of
laertes
turned
away
his
head
and
hid
his
hand
under
his
mantle
in
order
to
avoid
the
looks
and
kisses
of
the
suppliant
the
virgin
made
a
sign
to
him
to
fear
nothing
her
tranquil
gaze
said
i
follow
you
ulysses
and
bow
to
necessity
because
i
wish
to
die
daughter
of
priam
and
sister
of
hector
my
couch
which
was
once
worthy
of
kings
shall
never
receive
a
foreign
master
freely
do
i
quit
the
light
of
hecuba
lying
motionless
in
the
dust
suddenly
rose
and
enfolded
her
daughter
in
a
last
despairing
embrace
polyxena
gently
but
resolutely
removed
the
old
arms
which
held
her
she
seemed
to
say
do
not
expose
yourself
mother
to
the
fury
of
your
master
do
not
wait
until
he
drags
you
ignominiously
on
the
ground
in
tearing
me
from
your
arms
better
o
mother
to
give
me
your
wrinkled
hand
and
bend
your
hollow
cheeks
to
my
the
face
of
thais
looked
beautiful
in
its
grief
the
crowd
felt
grateful
to
her
for
showing
them
the
forms
and
passions
of
life
endowed
with
superhuman
grace
and
paphnutius
pardoned
her
present
splendour
on
account
of
her
coming
humility
and
glorified
himself
in
advance
for
the
saint
he
was
about
to
give
to
heaven
the
drama
neared
its
end
hecuba
fell
as
though
dead
and
polyxena
led
by
ulysses
advanced
towards
the
tomb
which
was
surrounded
by
the
chief
warriors
a
dirge
was
sung
as
she
mounted
the
funeral
pile
on
the
summit
of
which
the
son
of
achilles
poured
out
libations
from
a
gold
cup
to
the
manes
of
the
hero
when
the
sacrificing
priests
stretched
out
their
arms
to
seize
her
she
made
a
sign
that
she
wished
to
die
free
and
unbound
as
befitted
the
daughter
of
so
many
kings
then
tearing
aside
her
robe
she
bared
her
bosom
to
the
blow
pyrrhus
turning
away
his
head
plunged
his
sword
into
her
heart
and
by
a
skilful
trick
the
blood
gushed
forth
over
the
dazzling
white
breast
of
the
virgin
who
with
head
thrown
back
and
her
eyes
swimming
in
the
horrors
of
death
fell
with
grace
and
modesty
whilst
the
warriors
enshrouded
the
victim
with
a
veil
and
covered
her
with
lilies
and
anemones
terrified
screams
and
groans
rent
the
air
and
paphnutius
rising
from
his
seat
prophesied
in
a
loud
voice
gentiles
vile
worshippers
of
demons
and
you
arians
more
infamous
than
the
idolaters
learn
that
which
you
have
just
seen
is
an
image
and
a
symbol
there
is
a
mystic
meaning
in
this
fable
and
very
soon
the
woman
you
see
there
will
be
offered
a
willing
and
happy
sacrifice
to
the
risen
but
already
the
crowd
was
surging
in
dark
waves
towards
the
exits
the
abbot
of
antinoe
escaping
from
the
astonished
dorion
gained
the
door
still
prophesying
an
hour
later
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
house
of
thais
the
actress
then
lived
in
the
rich
racotis
quarter
near
the
tomb
of
alexander
in
a
house
surrounded
by
shady
gardens
in
which
a
brook
bordered
with
poplars
flowed
amidst
artificial
rocks
an
old
black
slave
woman
loaded
with
rings
opened
the
door
and
asked
what
he
wanted
i
wish
to
see
thais
he
replied
god
is
my
witness
that
i
came
here
for
no
other
as
he
wore
a
rich
tunic
and
spoke
in
an
imperious
manner
the
slave
allowed
him
to
enter
you
will
find
thais
she
said
in
the
grotto
of
part
the
second
the
papyrus
thais
was
born
of
free
but
poor
parents
who
were
idolaters
when
she
was
a
very
little
girl
her
father
kept
at
alexandria
near
the
gate
of
the
moon
an
inn
which
was
frequented
by
sailors
she
still
retained
some
vivid
but
disconnected
memories
of
her
early
youth
she
remembered
her
father
seated
at
the
corner
of
the
hearth
with
his
legs
crossed
tall
formidable
and
quiet
like
one
of
those
old
pharaohs
who
are
celebrated
in
the
ballads
sung
by
blind
men
at
the
street
corners
she
remembered
also
her
thin
wretched
mother
wandering
like
a
hungry
cat
about
the
house
which
she
filled
with
the
tones
of
her
sharp
voice
and
the
glitter
of
her
phosphorescent
eyes
they
said
in
the
neighbourhood
that
she
was
a
witch
and
changed
into
an
owl
at
night
and
flew
to
see
her
lovers
it
was
a
lie
thais
knew
well
having
often
watched
her
that
her
mother
practised
no
magic
arts
but
that
she
was
eaten
up
with
avarice
and
counted
all
night
the
gains
of
the
day
the
idle
father
and
the
greedy
mother
let
the
child
live
as
best
it
could
like
one
of
the
fowls
in
the
she
became
very
clever
in
extracting
one
by
one
the
oboli
from
the
belt
of
some
drunken
sailor
and
in
amusing
the
drinkers
with
artless
songs
and
obscene
words
the
meaning
of
which
she
did
not
know
she
passed
from
knee
to
knee
in
a
room
reeking
with
the
odours
of
fermented
drinks
and
resiny
then
her
cheeks
sticky
with
beer
and
pricked
by
rough
beards
she
escaped
clutching
the
oboli
in
her
little
hand
and
ran
to
buy
from
an
old
woman
who
crouched
behind
her
baskets
under
the
gate
of
the
moon
every
day
the
same
scenes
were
repeated
the
sailors
relating
their
perilous
adventures
then
playing
at
dice
or
and
blaspheming
the
gods
amid
their
shouting
for
the
best
beer
of
cilicia
every
night
the
child
was
awakened
by
the
quarrels
of
the
drunkards
would
fly
across
the
tables
cutting
the
heads
of
those
they
hit
and
the
uproar
was
terrible
sometimes
she
saw
by
the
light
of
the
smoky
lamps
the
knives
glitter
and
the
blood
flow
it
humiliated
her
to
think
that
the
only
person
who
showed
her
any
human
kindness
in
her
young
days
was
the
mild
and
gentle
ahmes
ahmes
the
a
nubian
blacker
than
the
pot
he
gravely
skimmed
was
as
good
as
a
long
night
s
sleep
often
he
would
take
thais
on
his
knee
and
tell
her
old
tales
about
underground
constructed
for
avaricious
kings
who
put
to
death
the
masons
and
architects
there
were
also
tales
about
clever
thieves
who
married
kings
daughters
and
courtesans
who
built

little
thais
loved
ahmes
like
a
father
like
a
mother
like
a
nurse
and
like
a
dog
she
followed
the
slave
into
the
cellar
when
he
went
to
fill
the
amphorae
and
into
the
amongst
the
scraggy
and
ragged
fowls
all
beak
claws
and
feathers
who
flew
swifter
than
eagles
before
the
knife
of
the
black
cook
often
at
night
on
the
straw
instead
of
sleeping
he
built
for
thais
little
and
ships
no
bigger
than
his
hand
with
all
their
rigging
he
had
been
badly
treated
by
his
masters
one
of
his
ears
was
torn
and
his
body
covered
with
scars
yet
his
features
always
wore
an
air
of
joyous
peace
and
no
one
ever
asked
him
whence
he
drew
the
consolation
in
his
soul
and
the
peace
in
his
heart
he
was
as
simple
as
a
child
as
he
performed
his
heavy
tasks
he
sang
in
a
harsh
voice
hymns
which
made
the
child
tremble
and
dream
he
murmured
in
a
gravely
joyous
tone
tell
us
mary
what
thou
hast
seen
where
thou
hast
been
i
saw
the
shroud
and
the
linen
cloths
and
the
angels
seated
on
the
tomb
and
i
saw
the
glory
of
the
risen
she
asked
him
father
why
do
you
sing
about
angels
seated
on
a
tomb
and
he
replied
little
light
of
my
eyes
i
sing
of
the
angels
because
jesus
our
lord
is
risen
to
ahmes
was
a
christian
he
had
been
baptised
and
was
known
as
theodore
at
the
meetings
of
the
faithful
to
which
he
went
secretly
during
the
hours
allowed
him
for
sleep
at
that
time
the
church
was
suffering
the
severest
trials
by
order
of
the
emperor
the
churches
had
been
thrown
down
the
holy
books
burned
the
sacred
vessels
and
candlesticks
melted
the
christians
had
been
deprived
of
all
their
honours
and
expected
nothing
but
death
terror
reigned
over
all
the
community
at
alexandria
and
the
prisons
were
crammed
with
victims
it
was
whispered
with
horror
amongst
the
faithful
that
in
syria
in
arabia
in
mesopotamia
in
cappadocia
in
all
the
empire
bishops
and
virgins
had
been
flogged
tortured
crucified
or
thrown
to
wild
beasts
then
anthony
already
celebrated
for
his
visions
and
his
solitary
life
a
prophet
and
the
head
of
all
the
egyptian
believers
descended
like
an
eagle
from
his
desert
rock
on
the
city
of
alexandria
and
flying
from
church
to
church
fired
the
whole
community
with
his
holy
ardour
invisible
to
the
pagans
he
was
present
at
the
same
time
at
all
the
meetings
of
christians
endowing
all
with
the
spirit
of
strength
and
prudence
by
which
he
was
animated
slaves
in
particular
were
persecuted
with
singular
severity
many
of
them
seized
with
fright
denied
the
faith
others
and
by
far
the
greater
number
fled
to
the
desert
hoping
to
live
there
either
as
hermits
or
robbers
ahmes
however
frequented
the
meetings
as
usual
visited
the
prisoners
buried
the
martyrs
and
joyfully
professed
the
religion
of
christ
the
great
anthony
who
saw
his
unshaken
zeal
before
he
returned
into
the
desert
pressed
the
black
slave
in
his
arms
and
gave
him
the
kiss
of
peace
when
thais
was
seven
years
old
ahmes
began
to
talk
to
her
of
god
the
good
lord
god
he
said
lived
in
heaven
like
a
pharaoh
under
the
tents
of
his
harem
and
under
the
trees
of
his
gardens
he
was
the
ancient
of
ancients
and
older
than
the
world
and
he
had
but
one
son
the
prince
jesus
whom
he
loved
with
all
his
heart
and
who
surpassed
in
beauty
the
virgins
and
the
angels
and
the
good
lord
god
said
to
prince
jesus
leave
my
harem
and
my
palace
and
my
date
trees
and
my
running
waters
descend
to
earth
for
the
welfare
of
men
there
thou
shalt
be
like
a
little
child
and
thou
shalt
live
poor
amongst
the
poor
suffering
shall
be
thy
daily
bread
and
thou
shalt
weep
so
profusely
that
thy
tears
shall
form
rivers
in
which
the
tired
slave
shall
bathe
with
delight
go
my
son
prince
jesus
obeyed
the
good
lord
and
he
came
down
to
earth
to
a
place
named
bethlehem
of
judaea
and
he
walked
in
fields
amidst
the
flowering
anemones
saying
to
his
companion
blessed
are
they
who
hunger
for
i
will
lead
them
to
my
father
s
table
blessed
are
they
who
thirst
for
they
shall
drink
of
the
fountains
of
heaven
blessed
are
they
who
weep
for
i
will
dry
their
tears
with
veils
finer
than
those
of
the
almehs
that
is
why
the
poor
loved
him
and
believed
in
him
but
the
rich
hated
him
fearing
that
he
should
raise
the
poor
above
them
at
that
time
cleopatra
and
caesar
were
powerful
on
the
earth
they
both
hated
jesus
and
they
ordered
the
judges
and
priests
to
put
him
to
death
to
obey
the
queen
of
egypt
the
princes
of
syria
erected
a
cross
on
a
high
mountain
and
they
caused
jesus
to
die
on
this
cross
but
women
washed
his
corpse
and
buried
it
and
prince
jesus
having
broken
the
door
of
his
tomb
rose
again
to
the
good
lord
his
father
and
from
that
time
all
those
who
believed
in
him
go
to
heaven
the
lord
god
opens
his
arms
and
says
to
them
ye
are
welcome
because
ye
love
the
prince
my
son
wash
and
then
they
bathe
to
the
sound
of
beautiful
music
and
all
the
time
they
are
eating
they
see
almehs
dancing
and
they
listen
to
tales
that
never
end
they
are
dearer
to
the
good
lord
god
than
the
light
of
his
eyes
because
they
are
his
guests
and
they
shall
have
for
their
portion
the
carpets
of
his
house
and
the
pomegranates
of
his
ahmes
often
spoke
in
this
strain
and
thus
taught
the
truth
to
thais
she
wondered
and
said
i
should
like
to
eat
the
pomegranates
of
the
good
ahmes
replied
only
those
who
are
baptised
may
taste
the
fruits
of
and
thais
asked
to
be
baptised
seeing
by
this
that
she
believed
in
jesus
the
slave
resolved
to
instruct
her
more
fully
so
that
being
baptised
she
might
enter
the
church
and
he
loved
her
as
his
spiritual
daughter
the
child
unloved
and
uncared
for
by
its
selfish
parents
had
no
bed
in
the
house
she
slept
in
a
corner
of
the
stable
amongst
the
domestic
animals
and
there
ahmes
came
to
her
every
night
secretly
he
gently
approached
the
mat
on
which
she
lay
and
sat
down
on
his
heels
his
legs
bent
and
his
body
straight
a
position
hereditary
to
his
race
his
face
and
his
body
which
was
clothed
in
black
were
invisible
in
the
darkness
but
his
big
white
eyes
shone
out
and
there
came
from
them
a
light
like
a
ray
of
dawn
through
the
chinks
of
a
door
he
spoke
in
a
husky
monotonous
tone
with
a
slight
nasal
twang
that
gave
it
the
soft
melody
of
music
heard
at
night
in
the
streets
sometimes
the
breathing
of
an
ass
or
the
soft
lowing
of
an
ox
accompanied
like
a
chorus
of
invisible
spirits
the
voice
of
the
slave
as
he
recited
the
gospels
his
words
flowed
gently
in
the
darkness
which
they
filled
with
zeal
mercy
and
hope
and
the
neophyte
her
hand
in
that
of
ahmes
lulled
by
the
monotonous
sounds
and
the
vague
visions
in
her
mind
slept
calm
and
smiling
amid
the
harmonies
of
the
dark
night
and
the
holy
mysteries
gazed
down
on
by
a
star
which
twinkled
between
the
joists
of
the
the
initiation
lasted
a
whole
year
till
the
time
when
the
christians
joyfully
celebrate
the
festival
of
easter
one
night
in
the
holy
week
thais
who
was
already
asleep
on
her
mat
felt
herself
lifted
by
the
slave
whose
eyes
gleamed
with
a
strange
light
he
was
clad
not
as
usual
in
a
pair
of
torn
drawers
but
in
a
long
white
cloak
beneath
which
he
pressed
the
child
whispering
to
her
come
my
soul
come
light
of
my
eyes
come
little
sweetheart
come
and
be
clad
in
the
baptismal
robes
he
carried
the
child
pressed
to
his
breast
frightened
and
yet
curious
thais
her
head
out
of
the
cloak
threw
her
arms
round
her
friend
s
neck
and
he
ran
with
her
through
the
darkness
they
went
down
narrow
black
alleys
they
passed
through
the
jews
quarter
they
skirted
a
cemetery
where
the
osprey
uttered
its
dismal
cry
they
traversed
an
open
space
passing
under
crosses
on
which
hung
the
bodies
of
victims
and
on
the
arms
of
the
crosses
the
ravens
clacked
their
beaks
thais
hid
her
head
in
the
slave
s
breast
she
did
not
dare
to
peep
out
all
the
rest
of
the
way
soon
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
going
down
under
ground
when
she
reopened
her
eyes
she
found
herself
in
a
narrow
cave
lighted
by
resin
torches
on
the
walls
of
which
were
painted
standing
figures
which
seemed
to
move
and
live
in
the
flickering
glare
of
the
torches
they
were
men
clad
in
long
tunics
and
carrying
branches
of
palm
and
around
them
were
lambs
doves
and
tendrils
of
vine
amongst
these
figures
thais
recognised
jesus
of
nazareth
by
the
anemones
flowering
at
his
feet
in
the
centre
of
the
cave
near
a
large
stone
font
filled
with
water
stood
an
old
man
clad
in
a
scarlet
dalmatic
embroidered
with
gold
and
on
his
head
a
low
mitre
his
thin
face
ended
in
a
long
beard
he
looked
gentle
and
humble
in
spite
of
his
rich
costume
this
was
bishop
vivantius
an
exiled
dignitary
of
the
church
of
cyrene
who
now
gained
his
livelihood
by
weaving
common
stuffs
of
goats
hair
two
poor
children
stood
by
his
side
close
by
an
old
negress
unfolded
a
little
white
robe
ahmes
set
the
child
down
on
the
ground
and
kneeling
before
the
bishop
said
father
this
is
the
little
soul
the
child
of
my
soul
i
have
brought
her
that
you
may
according
to
your
promise
and
if
it
please
your
holiness
bestow
on
her
the
baptism
of
at
these
words
the
bishop
opened
his
arms
and
showed
his
mutilated
hands
his
nails
had
been
torn
out
because
he
had
maintained
the
faith
in
the
days
of
persecution
thais
was
frightened
and
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
ahmes
but
the
kind
words
of
the
priest
reassured
her
fear
nothing
dearly
beloved
little
one
thou
hast
here
a
spiritual
father
ahmes
who
is
called
theodore
amongst
the
faithful
and
a
kind
mother
in
grace
who
has
prepared
for
thee
with
her
own
hands
a
white
and
turning
towards
the
negress
she
is
called
nitida
he
added
and
is
a
slave
in
this
world
but
in
heaven
she
will
be
a
spouse
of
then
he
said
to
the
child
neophyte
thais
dost
thou
believe
in
god
the
father
almighty
and
in
his
only
son
who
died
for
our
salvation
and
in
all
that
the
apostles
taught
yes
replied
together
the
negro
and
negress
who
held
her
by
each
hand
by
the
bishop
s
orders
nitida
knelt
down
and
undressed
thais
the
child
was
quite
naked
round
her
neck
was
an
amulet
the
pontiff
plunged
her
three
times
into
the
baptismal
font
the
acolytes
brought
the
oil
with
which
vivantius
anointed
the
catechumen
and
the
salt
a
morsel
of
which
he
placed
on
her
tongue
then
having
dried
that
body
which
was
destined
after
many
trials
to
life
immortal
the
slave
nitida
put
on
thais
the
white
robe
she
had
woven
the
bishop
gave
to
each
and
all
the
kiss
of
peace
and
the
ceremony
being
terminated
took
off
his
sacerdotal
insignia
when
they
had
left
the
crypt
ahmes
said
we
ought
to
rejoice
that
we
have
this
day
brought
a
soul
to
the
good
lord
god
let
us
go
to
the
house
of
your
holiness
and
spend
the
rest
of
the
night
in
thou
hast
well
said
theodore
replied
the
bishop
and
he
led
the
little
band
to
his
house
which
was
quite
near
it
consisted
of
a
single
room
furnished
with
a
couple
of
looms
a
heavy
table
and
a
carpet
as
soon
as
they
had
entered
nitida
cried
the
nubian
bring
hither
the
stove
and
the
jar
of
oil
and
we
will
have
a
good
saying
thus
he
drew
from
under
his
cloak
some
little
fish
which
he
had
kept
concealed
and
lighted
a
fire
and
fried
them
the
bishop
the
girl
the
two
boys
and
the
two
slaves
sat
in
a
ring
on
the
carpet
ate
the
fried
fish
and
blessed
the
lord
vivantius
spoke
of
the
torture
he
had
undergone
and
prophesied
the
speedy
triumph
of
the
church
his
language
was
grotesque
and
full
of
and
rhetorical
tropes
he
compared
the
life
of
the
just
to
a
tissue
of
purple
and
to
explain
the
mystery
of
baptism
he
said
the
divine
spirit
floated
on
the
waters
and
that
is
why
christians
receive
the
baptism
of
water
but
demons
also
inhabit
the
brooks
springs
consecrated
to
nymphs
are
especially
dangerous
and
there
are
certain
waters
which
cause
various
maladies
both
of
the
soul
and
of
the
sometimes
he
spoke
enigmatically
and
the
child
listened
to
him
with
profound
awe
and
wonder
at
the
end
of
the
repast
he
offered
his
guests
a
little
wine
and
this
unloosed
their
tongues
and
they
began
to
sing
lamentations
and
hymns
ahmes
and
nitida
then
rose
and
danced
a
nubian
dance
which
they
had
learned
as
children
and
which
no
doubt
had
been
danced
by
their
tribe
since
the
early
ages
of
the
world
it
was
a
love
dance
waving
their
arms
and
moving
their
bodies
in
rhythmic
measure
they
feigned
in
turn
to
fly
from
and
to
pursue
each
other
their
big
eyes
rolled
and
they
showed
their
gleaming
teeth
in
broad
grins
in
this
strange
manner
did
thais
receive
the
holy
rite
of
baptism
she
loved
amusements
and
as
she
grew
vague
desires
were
created
in
her
mind
all
day
long
she
danced
and
sang
with
the
children
in
the
streets
and
when
at
night
she
returned
to
her
father
s
house
she
was
still
singing
crooked
twist
why
do
you
stay
in
the
house
i
comb
the
wool
and
the
miletan
threads
crooked
twist
what
did
your
son
die
of
he
fell
from
the
white
horses
into
the
she
now
began
to
prefer
the
company
of
boys
and
girls
to
that
of
the
gentle
and
quiet
ahmes
she
did
not
notice
that
her
friend
was
not
so
often
with
her
the
persecution
having
relented
the
christians
were
able
to
assemble
more
regularly
and
the
nubian
frequented
these
meetings
assiduously
his
zeal
increased
and
he
sometimes
uttered
mysterious
threats
he
said
that
the
rich
would
not
keep
their
wealth
he
went
to
the
public
places
to
which
the
poorer
christians
used
to
resort
and
assembling
together
all
the
poor
wretches
who
were
lying
in
the
shade
of
the
old
walls
he
announced
to
them
that
all
slaves
would
soon
be
free
and
that
the
day
of
justice
was
at
hand
in
the
kingdom
of
god
he
said
the
slaves
will
drink
new
wine
and
eat
delicious
fruits
whilst
the
rich
crouching
at
their
feet
like
dogs
will
devour
the
crumbs
from
their
these
sayings
were
noised
abroad
through
all
that
quarter
of
the
city
and
the
masters
feared
that
ahmes
might
incite
the
slaves
to
revolt
the
innkeeper
hated
him
intensely
though
he
carefully
concealed
his
rancour
one
day
a
silver
reserved
for
the
table
of
the
gods
disappeared
from
the
inn
ahmes
was
accused
of
having
stolen
it
out
of
hate
to
his
master
and
to
the
gods
of
the
empire
there
was
no
proof
of
the
accusation
and
the
slave
vehemently
denied
the
charge
nevertheless
he
was
dragged
before
the
tribunal
and
as
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
bad
servant
the
judge
condemned
him
to
death
as
you
did
not
know
how
to
make
a
good
use
of
your
hands
he
said
they
will
be
nailed
to
the
ahmes
heard
the
verdict
quietly
bowed
to
the
judge
most
respectfully
and
was
taken
to
the
public
prison
during
the
three
days
that
remained
to
him
he
did
not
cease
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
prisoners
and
it
was
related
afterwards
that
the
criminals
and
the
gaoler
himself
touched
by
his
words
believed
in
jesus
crucified
he
was
taken
to
the
very
place
which
one
night
less
than
two
years
before
he
had
crossed
so
joyfully
carrying
in
his
cloak
little
thais
the
daughter
of
his
soul
his
darling
flower
when
his
hands
were
nailed
to
the
cross
he
uttered
no
complaint
but
many
times
he
sighed
and
murmured
i
his
agony
lasted
three
days
and
three
nights
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
human
flesh
could
have
endured
such
prolonged
torture
many
times
it
was
thought
he
was
dead
the
flies
clustered
on
his
eyelids
but
suddenly
he
would
reopen
his
bloodshot
eyes
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
he
sang
in
a
voice
clearer
and
purer
than
that
of
a
child
tell
us
mary
what
thou
hast
seen
where
thou
hast
been
then
he
smiled
and
said
they
come
the
angels
of
the
good
lord
they
bring
me
wine
and
fruit
how
refreshing
is
the
fanning
of
their
wings
and
he
expired
his
features
preserved
in
death
an
expression
of
ecstatic
happiness
even
the
soldiers
who
guarded
the
cross
were
struck
with
wonder
vivantius
accompanied
by
some
of
the
christian
brethren
claimed
the
body
and
buried
it
with
the
remains
of
the
other
martyrs
in
the
crypt
of
john
the
baptist
and
the
church
venerated
the
memory
of
saint
theodore
the
nubian
three
years
later
constantine
the
conquerer
of
maxentius
issued
an
edict
which
granted
toleration
to
the
christians
and
the
believers
were
not
henceforth
persecuted
except
by
heretics
thais
had
completed
her
eleventh
year
when
her
friend
was
tortured
to
death
and
she
felt
deeply
saddened
and
shocked
her
soul
was
not
sufficiently
pure
to
allow
her
to
understand
that
the
slave
ahmes
was
blessed
both
in
his
life
and
his
death
the
idea
sprang
up
in
her
little
mind
that
no
one
can
be
good
in
this
world
except
at
the
cost
of
the
most
terrible
sufferings
and
she
was
afraid
to
be
good
for
her
delicate
flesh
could
not
bear
pain
at
an
early
age
she
had
given
herself
to
the
lads
about
the
port
and
she
followed
the
old
men
who
wandered
about
the
quarter
in
the
evening
and
with
what
she
received
from
them
she
bought
cakes
and
trinkets
as
she
did
not
take
home
any
of
the
money
she
gained
her
mother
continually
her
to
get
out
of
reach
of
her
mother
s
arm
she
often
ran
to
the
city
walls
and
hid
with
the
lizards
there
she
thought
with
envy
of
the
ladies
she
had
seen
pass
her
richly
dressed
and
in
a
litter
surrounded
by
slaves
one
day
when
she
had
been
beaten
more
brutally
than
usual
she
was
crouching
down
beside
the
gate
motionless
and
sulky
when
an
old
woman
stopped
in
front
of
her
looked
at
her
for
some
moments
in
silence
and
then
cried
oh
the
pretty
flower
the
beautiful
child
happy
is
the
father
who
begot
thee
and
the
mother
who
brought
thee
into
the
world
thais
remained
silent
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
her
eyelids
were
red
and
it
was
evident
she
had
been
weeping
my
white
violet
continued
the
old
woman
is
not
your
mother
happy
to
have
nourished
a
little
goddess
like
you
and
does
not
your
father
when
he
sees
you
rejoice
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
to
which
the
child
replied
as
though
talking
to
herself
my
father
is
a
swollen
with
wine
and
my
mother
a
greedy
the
old
woman
glanced
to
right
and
left
to
see
if
she
were
observed
then
in
a
fawning
voice
sweet
flowering
hyacinth
beautiful
drinker
of
light
come
with
me
and
you
shall
have
nothing
to
do
but
dance
and
smile
i
will
feed
you
on
honey
cakes
and
my
son
my
own
son
will
love
you
as
his
eyes
my
son
is
handsome
and
young
he
has
but
little
beard
on
his
chin
his
skin
is
soft
and
he
is
as
they
say
a
little
acharnian
thais
replied
i
am
quite
willing
to
go
with
and
she
rose
and
followed
the
old
woman
out
of
the
city
the
old
woman
who
was
named
moeroe
went
from
city
to
city
with
a
troupe
of
girls
and
boys
whom
she
taught
to
dance
and
then
hired
out
to
rich
people
to
appear
at
feasts
guessing
that
thais
would
soon
develop
into
a
most
beautiful
woman
she
taught
her
with
the
help
of
a
whip
music
and
prosody
and
she
flogged
with
leather
thongs
those
beautiful
legs
when
they
did
not
move
in
time
to
the
strains
of
the
cithara
her
son
a
decrepit
abortion
of
no
age
and
no
sex
the
child
on
whom
he
vented
the
hate
he
had
for
all
womankind
like
the
whose
grace
he
affected
he
knew
and
taught
thais
the
art
of
pantomime
and
how
to
mimic
by
expression
gesture
and
attitude
all
human
passions
and
more
especially
the
passions
of
love
he
was
a
clever
master
though
he
disliked
his
work
but
he
was
jealous
of
his
pupil
and
as
soon
as
he
discovered
that
she
was
born
to
give
men
pleasure
he
scratched
her
cheeks
pinched
her
arms
or
pricked
her
legs
as
a
spiteful
girl
would
have
done
thanks
however
to
his
lessons
she
quickly
became
an
excellent
musician
pantomimist
and
dancer
the
brutality
of
her
master
did
not
at
all
surprise
her
it
seemed
natural
to
her
to
be
badly
treated
she
even
felt
some
respect
for
the
old
woman
who
knew
music
and
drank
greek
wine
moeroe
when
she
came
to
antioch
praised
her
pupil
to
the
rich
merchants
of
the
city
who
gave
banquets
both
as
a
dancer
and
a
thais
danced
and
pleased
she
accompanied
the
rich
bankers
when
they
left
the
table
into
the
shady
groves
on
the
banks
of
the
orontes
she
gave
herself
to
all
for
she
knew
nothing
of
the
price
of
love
but
one
night
that
she
had
danced
before
the
most
fashionable
young
men
of
the
city
the
son
of
the
came
to
her
radiant
with
youth
and
pleasure
and
said
in
a
voice
that
seemed
redolent
of
kisses
why
am
i
not
thais
the
wreath
which
crowns
your
hair
the
tunic
which
enfolds
your
beautiful
form
the
sandal
on
your
pretty
foot
i
wish
you
to
tread
me
under
foot
as
a
sandal
i
wish
my
caresses
to
be
your
tunic
and
your
wreath
come
sweet
girl
come
to
my
house
and
let
us
forget
the
she
looked
at
him
whilst
he
was
speaking
and
saw
that
he
was
handsome
suddenly
she
felt
a
cold
sweat
on
her
face
she
turned
green
as
grass
she
reeled
a
cloud
descended
before
her
eyes
he
again
implored
her
to
come
with
him
but
she
refused
his
ardent
looks
his
burning
words
were
vain
and
when
he
took
her
in
his
arms
to
try
and
drag
her
away
she
pushed
him
off
rudely
then
he
implored
her
and
shed
tears
but
a
new
unknown
and
invincible
passion
dominated
her
heart
and
she
still
resisted
what
madness
said
the
guests
lollius
is
noble
handsome
and
rich
and
a
treats
him
with
scorn
lollius
returned
home
alone
that
night
quite
he
came
in
the
morning
pale
and
and
hung
flowers
at
the
s
door
but
thais
was
frightened
and
troubled
she
avoided
lollius
and
yet
he
was
continually
in
her
mind
she
suffered
and
she
did
not
know
the
cause
of
her
complaint
she
wondered
why
she
had
thus
changed
and
why
she
was
melancholy
she
recoiled
from
all
her
lovers
they
were
hateful
to
her
she
loathed
the
light
of
day
and
lay
on
her
bed
all
day
sobbing
and
with
her
head
buried
in
the
pillows
lollius
contrived
to
gain
admittance
and
came
many
times
but
neither
his
pleadings
nor
his
execrations
had
any
effect
on
the
obdurate
girl
in
his
presence
she
was
as
timid
as
a
virgin
and
would
say
nothing
but
i
will
not
i
will
not
but
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
she
gave
in
for
she
knew
that
she
loved
him
she
went
to
his
house
and
lived
with
him
they
were
supremely
happy
they
passed
their
days
shut
up
together
gazing
into
each
other
s
eyes
and
babbling
a
childish
jargon
in
the
evening
they
walked
on
the
lonely
banks
of
the
orontes
and
lost
themselves
in
the
laurel
woods
sometimes
they
rose
at
dawn
to
go
and
gather
hyacinths
on
the
slopes
of
sulpicus
they
drank
from
the
same
cup
and
he
would
take
a
grape
from
between
her
lips
with
his
mouth
moeroe
came
to
lollius
and
cried
and
shrieked
that
thais
should
be
restored
to
her
she
is
my
daughter
she
said
my
daughter
who
has
been
torn
from
me
my
perfumed
flower
my
own
bowels
lollius
gave
her
a
large
sum
of
money
and
sent
her
away
but
as
she
came
back
to
demand
some
more
gold
staters
the
young
man
had
her
put
in
prison
and
the
magistrates
having
discovered
that
she
was
guilty
of
many
crimes
she
was
condemned
to
death
and
thrown
to
the
wild
beasts
thais
loved
lollius
with
all
the
passion
of
her
mind
and
the
bewilderment
of
innocence
she
told
him
and
told
him
truly
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
i
have
never
loved
any
one
but
lollius
replied
you
are
not
like
any
other
the
spell
lasted
six
months
but
it
broke
at
last
thais
suddenly
felt
that
her
heart
was
empty
and
lonely
lollius
no
longer
seemed
the
same
to
her
she
thought
what
can
have
thus
changed
me
in
an
instant
how
is
it
that
he
is
now
like
any
other
man
and
no
longer
like
himself
she
left
him
not
without
a
secret
desire
to
find
lollius
again
in
another
as
she
no
longer
found
him
in
himself
she
thought
it
would
be
less
dull
to
live
with
someone
she
had
never
loved
than
with
one
she
had
ceased
to
love
she
appeared
in
the
company
of
rich
debauchees
at
those
sacred
feasts
at
which
naked
virgins
danced
in
the
temples
and
troops
of
courtesans
swam
across
the
orontes
she
took
part
in
all
the
pleasures
of
the
fashionable
and
depraved
city
and
she
assiduously
frequented
the
theatres
at
which
clever
mimes
from
all
countries
performed
amidst
the
applause
of
a
crowd
greedy
for
excitement
she
carefully
observed
the
mimes
dancers
comedians
and
especially
the
women
who
in
tragedies
represented
goddesses
in
love
with
young
men
or
mortals
loved
by
the
gods
having
discovered
the
secrets
by
which
they
pleased
the
audience
she
thought
to
herself
that
she
was
more
beautiful
and
could
act
better
she
went
to
the
manager
and
asked
to
be
admitted
into
the
troupe
thanks
to
her
beauty
and
to
the
lessons
she
had
received
from
old
moeroe
she
was
received
and
appeared
on
the
stage
in
the
part
of
dirce
she
met
with
but
indifferent
success
for
she
was
inexperienced
and
the
admiration
of
the
spectators
had
not
been
aroused
by
hearing
her
praises
sung
but
after
she
had
played
small
parts
for
a
few
months
the
power
of
her
beauty
burst
forth
with
such
effect
that
all
the
city
was
moved
all
antioch
crowded
to
the
theatre
the
imperial
magistrates
and
the
chief
citizens
were
compelled
by
the
force
of
public
opinion
to
show
themselves
there
the
porters
sweepers
and
dock
labourers
went
without
bread
and
garlic
that
they
might
pay
for
their
places
poets
composed
epigrams
in
her
honour
bearded
philosophers
inveighed
against
her
in
the
baths
and
gymnasia
when
her
litter
passed
christian
priests
turned
away
their
heads
the
threshold
of
her
door
was
wreathed
with
flowers
and
sprinkled
with
blood
she
received
so
much
money
from
her
lovers
that
it
was
no
longer
counted
but
measured
by
the
medimnus
and
all
the
treasure
hoarded
by
miserly
old
men
was
poured
out
at
her
feet
but
she
was
placid
and
unmoved
she
rejoiced
with
quiet
pride
in
the
admiration
of
the
public
and
the
favour
of
the
gods
and
was
so
much
loved
that
she
loved
herself
after
she
had
several
years
enjoyed
the
admiration
and
affection
of
the
antiochians
she
was
taken
with
a
desire
to
revisit
alexandria
and
show
her
glory
in
that
city
in
which
as
a
child
she
had
wandered
in
want
and
shame
hungry
and
lean
as
a
grasshopper
in
the
middle
of
a
dusty
road
the
golden
city
joyfully
welcomed
her
and
loaded
her
with
fresh
riches
when
she
appeared
in
the
games
it
was
a
triumph
countless
admirers
and
lovers
came
to
her
she
received
them
with
indifference
for
she
at
last
despaired
of
meeting
another
lollius
amongst
many
others
she
met
the
philosopher
nicias
who
desired
to
possess
her
although
he
professed
to
have
no
desires
in
spite
of
his
riches
he
was
intelligent
and
modest
but
his
delicate
wit
and
beautiful
sentiments
failed
to
charm
her
she
did
not
love
him
and
sometimes
his
refined
irony
even
irritated
her
his
perpetual
doubts
hurt
her
for
he
believed
in
nothing
and
she
believed
in
everything
she
believed
in
divine
providence
in
the
omnipotence
of
evil
spirits
in
spells
exorcisms
and
eternal
justice
she
believed
in
jesus
christ
and
in
the
goddess
of
good
of
the
syrians
she
believed
also
that
bitches
barked
when
black
hecate
passed
through
the
streets
and
that
a
woman
could
inspire
love
by
pouring
a
philtre
into
a
cup
wrapped
in
the
bleeding
skin
of
a
sheep
she
thirsted
for
the
unknown
she
called
on
nameless
gods
and
lived
in
perpetual
expectation
the
future
frightened
her
and
yet
she
wished
to
know
it
she
surrounded
herself
with
priests
of
isis
chaldean
magi
pharmacopolists
and
professors
of
the
black
arts
who
invariably
deceived
her
though
she
never
tired
of
being
deceived
she
feared
death
and
she
saw
it
everywhere
when
she
yielded
to
pleasure
it
seemed
to
her
that
an
icy
finger
would
suddenly
touch
her
on
the
bare
shoulder
and
she
turned
pale
and
cried
with
terror
in
the
arms
which
embraced
her
nicias
said
to
her
what
does
it
matter
o
my
thais
whether
we
descend
to
eternal
night
with
white
locks
and
hollow
cheeks
or
whether
this
very
day
now
laughing
to
the
vast
sky
shall
be
our
last
let
us
enjoy
life
we
shall
have
greatly
lived
if
we
have
greatly
loved
there
is
no
knowledge
except
that
of
the
senses
to
love
is
to
understand
that
which
we
do
not
know
does
not
exist
what
good
is
it
to
worry
ourselves
about
nothing
she
replied
angrily
i
despise
men
like
you
who
hope
for
nothing
and
fear
nothing
i
wish
to
know
i
wish
to
know
in
order
to
understand
the
secret
of
life
she
set
to
work
to
read
the
books
of
the
philosophers
but
she
did
not
understand
them
the
further
the
years
of
her
childhood
receded
from
her
the
more
anxious
she
was
to
recall
them
she
loved
to
traverse
at
night
in
disguise
the
alleys
squares
and
places
where
she
had
grown
up
so
miserably
she
was
sorry
she
had
lost
her
parents
and
especially
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
love
them
when
she
met
any
christian
priest
she
thought
of
her
baptism
and
felt
troubled
one
night
when
enveloped
in
a
long
cloak
and
her
fair
hair
hidden
under
a
black
hood
she
was
wandering
according
to
custom
about
the
suburbs
of
the
city
she
found
herself
without
knowing
how
she
came
there
before
the
poor
little
church
of
john
the
baptist
they
were
singing
inside
the
church
and
a
bright
light
glimmered
through
the
chinks
of
the
door
there
was
nothing
strange
in
that
as
for
the
past
twenty
years
the
christians
protected
by
the
conqueror
of
maxentius
had
publicly
solemnised
their
festivals
but
these
hymns
seemed
more
like
an
ardent
appeal
to
the
soul
as
if
she
had
been
invited
to
the
mysteries
she
pushed
the
door
open
with
her
arm
and
entered
the
building
she
found
a
numerous
assembly
of
women
children
and
old
men
on
their
knees
before
a
tomb
which
stood
against
the
wall
the
tomb
was
nothing
but
a
stone
coffer
roughly
sculptured
with
vine
tendrils
and
bunches
of
grapes
yet
it
had
received
great
honours
and
was
covered
with
green
palms
and
wreaths
of
red
roses
all
round
innumerable
lights
gleamed
out
of
the
heavy
shadow
in
which
the
smoke
of
arabian
gums
seemed
like
the
folds
of
angels
robes
and
the
paintings
on
the
walls
visions
of
paradise
priests
clad
in
white
were
prostrate
at
the
foot
of
the
sarcophagus
the
hymns
they
sang
with
the
people
expressed
the
delight
of
suffering
and
mingled
in
a
triumphal
mourning
so
much
joy
with
so
much
grief
that
thais
in
listening
to
them
felt
the
pleasures
of
life
and
the
terrors
of
death
flowing
at
the
same
time
through
her
senses
when
they
had
finished
singing
the
believers
rose
and
walked
in
single
file
to
the
tomb
the
side
of
which
they
kissed
they
were
common
men
accustomed
to
work
with
their
hands
they
advanced
with
a
heavy
step
the
eyes
fixed
the
jaw
dropped
but
they
had
an
air
of
sincerity
they
knelt
down
each
in
turn
before
the
sarcophagus
and
put
their
lips
to
it
the
women
lifted
their
little
children
in
their
arms
and
gently
placed
their
cheek
to
the
stone
thais
surprised
and
troubled
asked
a
deacon
why
they
did
so
do
you
not
know
woman
replied
the
deacon
that
we
celebrate
the
blessed
memory
of
theodore
the
nubian
who
suffered
for
the
faith
in
the
days
of
the
emperor
diocletian
he
lived
virtuously
and
died
a
martyr
and
that
is
why
robed
in
white
we
bear
red
roses
to
his
glorious
on
hearing
these
words
thais
fell
on
her
knees
and
burst
into
tears
recollections
of
ahmes
returned
to
her
mind
on
the
memory
of
this
obscure
gentle
and
unfortunate
man
the
blaze
of
candles
the
perfume
of
roses
the
clouds
of
incense
the
music
of
hymns
the
piety
of
souls
threw
all
the
charms
of
glory
thais
thought
in
the
dazzling
glare
he
was
good
and
now
he
has
become
great
and
glorious
why
is
it
that
he
is
elevated
above
other
men
what
is
this
unknown
thing
which
is
more
than
riches
or
pleasure
she
rose
slowly
and
turned
towards
the
tomb
of
the
saint
who
had
loved
her
those
violet
eyes
now
filled
with
tears
which
glittered
in
the
then
with
bowed
head
humble
slow
and
the
last
with
those
lips
on
which
so
many
desires
hung
she
kissed
the
stone
of
the
slave
s
tomb
when
she
returned
to
her
house
she
found
nicias
who
with
his
hair
perfumed
and
his
tunic
thrown
open
was
reading
a
treatise
on
morals
whilst
waiting
for
her
he
advanced
with
open
arms
naughty
thais
he
said
in
a
laughing
voice
whilst
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
come
do
you
know
what
i
saw
in
this
manuscript
written
by
the
gravest
of
stoics
precepts
of
virtue
and
noble
maxims
no
on
the
staid
papyrus
i
saw
dance
thousands
and
thousands
of
little
thaises
each
was
no
bigger
than
my
finger
and
yet
their
grace
was
infinite
and
all
were
the
only
thais
there
were
some
who
flaunted
in
mantles
of
purple
and
gold
others
like
a
white
cloud
floated
in
the
air
in
transparent
drapery
others
again
motionless
and
divinely
nude
the
better
to
inspire
pleasure
expressed
no
thought
lastly
there
were
two
hand
in
hand
two
so
alike
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
both
smiled
the
first
said
i
am
the
other
i
am
thus
speaking
he
pressed
thais
in
his
arms
and
not
noticing
the
sullen
look
in
her
downcast
eyes
he
went
on
adding
thought
to
thought
heedless
of
the
fact
that
they
were
all
lost
upon
her
yes
when
i
had
before
my
eyes
the
line
in
which
it
was
written
nothing
should
deter
you
from
improving
your
mind
i
read
the
kisses
of
thais
are
warmer
than
fire
and
sweeter
than
that
is
how
a
philosopher
reads
the
books
of
other
philosophers
and
that
is
your
fault
you
naughty
child
it
is
true
that
as
long
as
we
are
what
we
are
we
shall
never
find
anything
but
our
own
thoughts
in
the
thoughts
of
others
and
that
all
of
us
are
somewhat
inclined
to
read
books
as
i
have
read
this
she
did
not
hear
him
her
soul
was
still
before
the
nubian
s
tomb
as
he
heard
her
sigh
he
kissed
her
on
the
neck
and
said
do
not
be
sad
my
child
we
are
never
happy
in
this
world
except
when
we
forget
the
world
come
let
us
cheat
life
it
is
sure
to
take
its
revenge
come
let
us
love
but
she
pushed
him
away
love
she
cried
bitterly
never
loved
any
one
and
do
not
love
no
i
do
not
love
you
i
hate
you
go
i
hate
you
i
curse
and
despise
all
who
are
happy
and
all
who
are
rich
go
go
goodness
is
only
found
amongst
the
unfortunate
when
i
was
a
child
i
knew
a
black
slave
who
died
on
the
cross
he
was
good
he
was
filled
with
love
and
he
knew
the
secret
of
life
you
are
not
worthy
to
wash
his
feet
go
i
never
wish
to
see
you
again
she
threw
herself
on
her
face
on
the
carpet
and
passed
the
night
sobbing
and
weeping
and
forming
resolutions
to
live
in
future
like
saint
theodore
in
poverty
and
humbleness
the
next
day
she
devoted
herself
again
to
those
pleasures
to
which
she
was
addicted
as
she
knew
that
her
beauty
though
still
intact
would
not
last
very
long
she
hastened
to
derive
all
the
enjoyment
and
all
the
fame
she
could
from
it
at
the
theatre
where
she
acted
and
studied
more
than
ever
she
gave
life
to
the
imagination
of
sculptors
painters
and
poets
recognising
that
there
was
in
the
attitudes
movements
and
walk
of
the
actress
an
idea
of
the
divine
harmony
which
rules
the
spheres
wise
men
and
philosophers
considered
that
such
perfect
grace
was
a
virtue
in
itself
and
said
thais
also
is
a
geometrician
the
ignorant
the
poor
the
humble
and
the
timid
before
whom
she
consented
to
appear
regarded
her
as
a
blessing
from
heaven
yet
she
was
sad
amidst
all
the
praise
she
received
and
dreaded
death
more
than
ever
nothing
was
able
to
set
her
mind
at
rest
not
even
her
house
and
gardens
which
were
celebrated
and
a
proverb
throughout
the
city
the
gardens
were
planted
with
trees
brought
at
great
expense
from
india
and
persia
they
were
watered
by
a
running
brook
and
colonnades
in
ruins
and
imitation
rocks
arranged
by
a
skilful
artist
were
reflected
in
a
lake
which
also
mirrored
the
statues
that
stood
round
it
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
was
the
grotto
of
nymphs
which
owed
its
name
to
three
figures
of
women
which
stood
on
the
threshold
they
were
represented
as
divesting
themselves
of
their
garments
and
about
to
bathe
they
anxiously
turned
their
heads
fearing
to
be
seen
and
looked
as
though
they
were
alive
the
only
light
which
entered
the
building
came
tempered
and
iridescent
through
thin
sheets
of
water
all
the
walls
were
hung
as
in
the
sacred
grottoes
with
wreaths
garlands
and
votive
pictures
in
which
the
beauty
of
thais
was
celebrated
there
were
also
tragic
and
comic
masks
bright
with
colours
and
paintings
representing
theatrical
scenes
or
grotesque
figures
or
fabulous
animals
on
a
stele
in
the
centre
stood
a
little
ivory
eros
of
wonderful
antique
workmanship
it
was
a
gift
from
nicias
in
one
of
the
bays
was
a
figure
of
a
goat
in
black
marble
with
shining
agate
eyes
six
alabaster
kids
crowded
round
its
teats
but
raising
its
cloven
hoofs
and
its
ugly
head
it
seemed
impatient
to
climb
the
rocks
the
floor
was
covered
with
byzantine
carpets
pillows
embroidered
by
the
yellow
men
of
cathay
and
the
skins
of
libyan
lions
perfumed
smoke
arose
from
golden
censers
flowering
plants
grew
in
large
onyx
vases
and
at
the
far
end
in
the
purple
shadow
gleamed
the
gold
nails
on
the
shell
of
a
huge
indian
tortoise
turned
upside
down
which
served
as
the
bed
of
the
actress
it
was
here
that
every
day
to
the
murmur
of
the
water
and
amid
perfumes
and
flowers
thais
reclined
softly
and
conversed
with
her
friends
while
awaiting
the
hour
of
supper
or
meditated
in
solitude
on
theatrical
art
or
on
the
flight
of
years
on
the
afternoon
after
the
games
thais
was
reposing
in
the
grotto
of
nymphs
she
had
noticed
in
her
mirror
the
first
signs
of
the
decay
of
her
beauty
and
she
was
frightened
to
think
that
white
hair
and
wrinkles
would
at
last
come
she
vainly
tried
to
comfort
herself
with
the
assurance
that
she
could
recover
her
fresh
complexion
by
burning
certain
herbs
and
pronouncing
a
few
magic
words
a
pitiless
voice
cried
you
will
grow
old
thais
you
will
grow
and
a
cold
sweat
of
terror
bedewed
her
forehead
then
on
looking
at
herself
again
in
the
mirror
with
infinite
tenderness
she
found
that
she
was
still
beautiful
and
worthy
to
be
loved
she
smiled
to
herself
and
murmured
there
is
not
a
woman
in
alexandria
who
can
rival
me
in
suppleness
or
grace
or
movement
or
in
splendour
of
arms
and
the
arms
my
mirror
are
the
real
chains
of
love
while
she
was
thus
thinking
she
saw
an
unknown
man
thin
with
burning
eyes
and
unkempt
beard
and
clad
in
a
richly
embroidered
robe
standing
before
her
she
let
fall
her
mirror
and
uttered
a
cry
of
fright
paphnutius
stood
motionless
and
seeing
how
beautiful
she
was
he
murmured
this
prayer
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
grant
my
god
that
the
face
of
this
woman
may
not
be
a
temptation
but
may
prove
salutary
to
thy
then
forcing
himself
to
speak
he
said
thais
i
live
in
a
far
country
and
the
fame
of
thy
beauty
has
led
me
to
thee
it
is
said
that
thou
art
the
most
clever
of
actresses
and
the
most
irresistible
of
women
that
which
is
related
of
thy
riches
and
thy
love
affairs
seems
fabulous
and
calls
to
mind
the
old
story
of
rhodope
whose
marvellous
history
is
known
by
heart
to
all
the
boatmen
on
the
nile
therefore
i
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
know
thee
and
i
see
that
the
truth
surpasses
the
rumour
thou
art
a
thousand
times
more
clever
and
more
beautiful
than
is
reported
and
now
that
i
see
thee
i
say
to
myself
it
is
impossible
to
approach
her
without
staggering
like
a
drunken
the
words
were
feigned
but
the
monk
animated
by
pious
zeal
uttered
them
with
real
warmth
thais
gazed
without
displeasure
at
this
strange
being
who
had
frightened
her
the
rough
wild
aspect
and
the
fiery
glances
of
his
eyes
astonished
her
she
was
curious
to
learn
the
state
of
life
of
a
man
so
different
from
all
others
she
had
met
she
replied
with
gentle
raillery
you
seem
prompt
to
admire
stranger
beware
that
my
looks
do
not
consume
you
to
the
bones
beware
of
loving
me
he
said
i
love
thee
o
thais
i
love
thee
more
than
my
life
and
more
than
myself
for
thee
i
have
quitted
the
desert
for
thee
my
lips
vowed
to
silence
have
pronounced
profane
words
for
thee
i
have
seen
what
i
ought
not
to
have
seen
and
heard
what
it
was
forbidden
to
me
to
hear
for
thee
my
soul
is
troubled
my
heart
is
open
and
the
thoughts
gush
out
like
the
running
springs
at
which
the
pigeons
drink
for
thee
i
have
walked
day
and
night
across
sandy
deserts
teeming
with
reptiles
and
vampires
for
thee
i
have
placed
my
bare
foot
on
vipers
and
scorpions
yes
i
love
thee
i
love
thee
but
not
like
those
men
who
burning
with
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
come
to
thee
like
devouring
wolves
or
furious
bulls
thou
art
dear
to
them
as
is
the
gazelle
to
the
lion
their
ravening
lusts
will
consume
thee
to
the
soul
o
woman
i
love
thee
in
spirit
and
in
truth
i
love
thee
in
god
and
for
ever
and
ever
that
which
is
in
my
breast
is
named
true
zeal
and
divine
charity
i
promise
thee
better
things
than
drunkenness
crowned
with
flowers
or
the
dreams
of
a
brief
night
i
promise
thee
holy
feasts
and
celestial
suppers
the
happiness
that
i
bring
thee
will
never
end
it
is
it
is
ineffable
and
such
that
if
the
happy
of
this
world
could
only
see
a
shadow
of
it
they
would
die
of
thais
laughed
mischievously
friend
she
said
show
me
this
wonderful
love
make
haste
long
speeches
would
be
an
insult
to
my
beauty
let
us
not
lose
a
moment
i
am
impatient
to
taste
the
felicity
you
announce
but
to
say
the
truth
i
fear
that
i
shall
always
remain
ignorant
of
it
and
that
all
you
have
promised
me
will
vanish
in
words
it
is
easier
to
promise
a
great
happiness
than
to
give
it
everyone
has
a
talent
of
some
sort
i
fancy
that
yours
is
to
make
long
speeches
you
speak
of
an
unknown
love
it
is
so
long
since
kisses
were
first
exchanged
that
it
would
be
very
extraordinary
if
there
still
remained
secrets
in
love
on
this
subject
lovers
know
more
than
do
not
jest
thais
i
bring
thee
the
unknown
friend
you
come
too
late
i
know
every
kind
of
the
love
that
i
bring
thee
abounds
with
glory
whilst
the
loves
that
thou
knowest
breed
only
thais
looked
at
him
with
an
angry
eye
a
frown
gathered
on
her
beautiful
face
you
are
very
bold
stranger
to
offend
your
hostess
look
at
me
and
say
if
i
resemble
a
creature
crushed
down
with
shame
no
i
am
not
ashamed
and
all
others
who
live
like
me
are
not
ashamed
either
although
they
are
not
so
beautiful
or
so
rich
as
i
am
i
have
sown
pleasure
in
my
footsteps
and
i
am
celebrated
for
that
all
over
the
world
i
am
more
powerful
than
the
masters
of
the
world
i
have
seen
them
at
my
feet
look
at
me
look
at
these
little
feet
thousands
of
men
would
pay
with
their
blood
for
the
happiness
of
kissing
them
i
am
not
very
big
and
i
do
not
occupy
much
space
on
the
earth
to
those
who
look
at
me
from
the
top
of
the
serapeium
when
i
pass
in
the
street
i
look
like
a
grain
of
rice
but
that
grain
of
rice
has
caused
among
men
griefs
despairs
hates
and
crimes
enough
to
have
filled
tartarus
are
you
not
mad
to
talk
to
me
of
shame
when
all
around
proclaims
my
glory
that
which
is
glory
in
the
eyes
of
men
is
infamy
before
god
o
woman
we
have
been
nourished
in
countries
so
different
that
it
is
not
surprising
we
have
neither
the
same
language
nor
the
same
thoughts
yet
heaven
is
my
witness
that
i
wish
to
agree
with
thee
and
that
it
is
my
intention
not
to
leave
thee
until
we
share
the
same
sentiments
who
will
inspire
me
with
burning
words
that
will
melt
thee
like
wax
in
my
breath
o
woman
that
the
fingers
of
my
desires
may
mould
thee
as
they
wish
what
virtue
will
deliver
thee
to
me
o
dearest
of
souls
that
the
spirit
which
animates
me
creating
thee
a
second
time
may
imprint
on
thee
a
fresh
beauty
and
that
thou
mayest
cry
weeping
for
joy
it
is
only
now
that
i
am
born
who
will
cause
to
gush
in
my
heart
a
fount
of
siloam
in
which
thou
mayest
bathe
and
recover
thy
first
purity
who
will
change
me
into
a
jordan
the
waves
of
which
sprinkled
on
thee
will
give
thee
life
eternal
thais
was
no
longer
angry
this
man
she
thought
talks
of
life
eternal
and
all
that
he
says
seems
written
on
a
talisman
no
doubt
he
is
a
mage
and
knows
secret
charms
against
old
age
and
death
and
she
resolved
to
offer
herself
to
him
therefore
pretending
to
be
afraid
of
him
she
retired
a
few
steps
to
the
end
of
the
grotto
and
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
artfully
pulled
her
tunic
across
her
breast
then
motionless
and
mute
and
her
eyes
cast
down
she
waited
her
long
eyelashes
made
a
soft
shadow
on
her
cheeks
her
entire
attitude
expressed
modesty
her
naked
feet
swung
gently
and
she
looked
like
a
child
sitting
thinking
on
the
bank
of
a
brook
but
paphnutius
looked
at
her
and
did
not
move
his
trembling
knees
hardly
supported
him
his
tongue
dried
in
his
mouth
a
terrible
buzzing
rang
in
his
ears
but
all
at
once
his
sight
failed
and
he
could
see
nothing
before
him
but
a
thick
cloud
he
thought
that
the
hand
of
jesus
had
been
laid
on
his
eyes
to
hide
this
woman
from
them
reassured
by
such
succour
strengthened
and
fortified
he
said
with
a
gravity
worthy
of
an
old
hermit
of
the
desert
if
thou
givest
thyself
to
me
thinkest
thou
it
is
hidden
from
god
she
shook
her
head
god
who
forces
him
to
keep
his
eye
always
upon
the
grotto
of
nymphs
let
him
go
away
if
we
offend
him
but
why
should
we
offend
him
since
he
has
created
us
he
can
be
neither
angry
nor
surprised
to
see
us
as
he
made
us
and
acting
according
to
the
nature
he
has
given
us
a
good
deal
too
much
is
said
on
his
behalf
and
he
is
often
credited
with
ideas
he
never
had
you
yourself
stranger
do
you
know
his
true
character
who
are
you
that
you
should
speak
to
me
in
his
name
at
this
question
the
monk
opening
his
borrowed
robe
showed
the
cassock
and
said
i
am
paphnutius
abbot
of
antinoe
and
i
come
from
the
holy
desert
the
hand
that
drew
abraham
from
chaldaea
and
lot
from
sodom
has
separated
me
from
the
present
age
i
no
longer
existed
for
the
men
of
this
century
but
thy
image
appeared
to
me
in
my
sandy
jerusalem
and
i
knew
that
thou
wert
full
of
corruption
and
death
was
in
thee
and
now
i
am
before
thee
woman
as
before
a
grave
and
i
cry
unto
thee
thais
arise
at
the
words
paphnutius
monk
and
abbot
she
had
turned
pale
with
fright
and
now
with
dishevelled
hair
and
joined
hands
weeping
and
groaning
she
dragged
herself
to
the
feet
of
the
saint
do
not
hurt
me
why
have
you
come
what
do
you
want
of
me
do
not
hurt
me
i
know
that
the
saints
of
the
desert
hate
women
who
like
me
are
made
to
please
i
am
afraid
that
you
hate
me
and
want
to
hurt
me
go
i
do
not
doubt
your
power
but
know
paphnutius
that
you
should
neither
despise
me
nor
hate
me
i
have
never
like
many
of
the
men
i
know
laughed
at
your
voluntary
poverty
in
your
turn
do
not
make
a
crime
of
my
riches
i
am
beautiful
and
clever
in
acting
i
no
more
chose
my
condition
than
my
nature
i
was
made
for
that
which
i
do
i
was
born
to
charm
men
and
you
yourself
did
you
not
say
just
now
that
you
loved
me
do
not
use
your
science
against
me
do
not
pronounce
magic
words
which
would
destroy
my
beauty
or
change
me
into
a
statue
of
salt
do
not
terrify
me
i
am
already
too
frightened
do
not
kill
me
i
am
so
afraid
of
he
made
a
sign
to
her
to
rise
and
said
child
have
no
fear
i
will
utter
no
word
of
shame
or
scorn
i
come
on
behalf
of
him
who
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
well
and
drank
of
the
pitcher
which
the
woman
of
samaria
offered
to
him
and
who
also
when
he
supped
at
the
house
of
simon
received
the
perfumes
of
mary
i
am
not
without
sin
that
i
should
throw
the
first
stone
i
have
often
badly
employed
the
abundant
grace
which
god
has
bestowed
upon
me
it
was
not
anger
but
pity
which
took
me
by
the
hand
to
conduct
me
here
i
can
without
deceit
address
thee
in
words
of
love
for
it
is
the
zeal
in
my
heart
which
has
brought
me
to
thee
i
burn
with
the
fire
of
charity
and
if
thy
eyes
accustomed
only
to
the
gross
sights
of
the
flesh
could
see
things
in
their
mystic
aspect
i
should
appear
unto
thee
as
a
branch
broken
off
the
burning
bush
which
the
lord
showed
on
the
mountain
to
moses
of
old
that
he
might
understand
true
love
that
which
envelops
us
and
which
so
far
from
leaving
behind
it
mere
coals
and
ashes
purifies
and
perfumes
for
ever
that
which
it
i
believe
you
monk
and
no
longer
fear
either
deceit
or
from
you
i
have
often
heard
talk
of
the
hermits
of
the
thebaid
marvellous
things
have
been
told
concerning
anthony
and
paul
your
name
is
not
unknown
to
me
and
i
have
heard
say
that
though
you
are
still
young
you
equal
in
virtue
the
oldest
anchorites
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
and
without
knowing
who
you
were
i
felt
that
you
were
no
ordinary
man
tell
me
can
you
do
for
me
that
which
neither
the
priests
of
isis
nor
of
hermes
nor
of
the
celestial
juno
nor
the
chaldean
soothsayers
nor
the
babylonian
magi
have
been
able
to
effect
monk
if
you
love
me
can
you
prevent
me
from
dying
woman
whosoever
wishes
to
live
shall
live
flee
from
the
abominable
delights
in
which
thou
diest
for
ever
snatch
from
the
devils
who
will
burn
it
most
horribly
that
body
which
god
kneaded
with
his
spittle
and
animated
with
his
own
breath
thou
art
consumed
with
weariness
come
and
refresh
thyself
at
the
blessed
springs
of
solitude
come
and
drink
of
those
fountains
which
are
hidden
in
the
desert
and
which
gush
forth
to
heaven
careworn
soul

and
possess
that
which
thou
desirest
heart
greedy
for
joy
come
and
taste
true
joys
poverty
retirement
seclusion
in
the
bosom
of
god
enemy
of
christ
now
and
his
come
to
him
come
thou
whom
i
have
sought
and
thou
wilt
say
i
have
found
love
thais
seemed
lost
in
meditation
on
things
afar
monk
she
asked
if
i
adjure
all
pleasures
and
do
penance
is
it
true
that
i
shall
be
born
again
in
heaven
my
body
intact
in
all
its
beauty
thais
i
bring
thee
eternal
life
believe
me
for
that
which
i
announce
to
thee
is
the
who
will
assure
me
that
it
is
the
truth
david
and
the
prophets
the
scriptures
and
the
wonders
that
thou
shalt
monk
i
should
like
to
believe
you
for
i
must
confess
that
i
have
not
found
happiness
in
this
world
my
lot
in
life
is
better
than
that
of
a
queen
and
yet
i
have
many
bitternesses
and
misfortunes
and
i
am
infinitely
weary
of
my
existence
all
women
envy
me
and
yet
sometimes
i
have
envied
the
lot
of
a
toothless
old
woman
who
when
i
was
a
child
sold
under
one
of
the
city
gates
often
has
the
idea
flashed
across
my
mind
that
only
the
poor
are
good
happy
and
blessed
and
that
there
must
be
great
gladness
in
living
humble
and
obscure
monk
you
have
agitated
a
storm
in
my
soul
and
brought
to
the
surface
that
which
lay
at
the
bottom
who
am
i
to
believe
alas
and
what
is
to
become
of
me
and
what
is
life
whilst
she
thus
spoke
paphnutius
was
transfigured
celestial
joy
beamed
in
his
face
listen
he
said
i
was
not
alone
when
i
entered
this
house
another
accompanied
me
another
who
stands
by
my
side
him
thou
canst
not
see
because
thy
eyes
are
yet
unworthy
to
behold
him
but
soon
thou
shalt
see
him
in
all
his
glorious
splendour
and
thou
wilt
say
he
alone
is
to
be
but
now
if
he
had
not
placed
his
gentle
hands
before
my
eyes
o
thais
i
should
perhaps
have
fallen
into
sin
with
thee
for
of
myself
i
am
but
weak
and
sinful
but
he
saved
us
both
he
is
as
good
as
he
is
powerful
and
his
name
is
the
saviour
he
was
promised
to
the
world
by
david
and
the
prophets
worshipped
in
his
cradle
by
the
shepherds
and
the
magi
crucified
by
the
pharisees
buried
by
the
holy
women
revealed
to
the
world
by
the
apostles
testified
to
by
the
martyrs
and
now
having
learned
that
thou
fearest
death
o
woman
he
has
come
to
thy
house
to
prevent
thee
from
dying
art
thou
not
here
present
with
me
jesus
at
this
moment
as
thou
didst
appear
to
the
men
of
galilee
in
those
wonderful
days
when
the
stars
which
came
down
with
thee
from
heaven
were
so
near
the
earth
that
the
holy
innocents
could
take
them
in
their
hands
when
they
played
in
their
mothers
arms
on
the
terraces
of
bethlehem
is
it
not
true
jesus
that
thou
art
here
present
and
that
thou
showest
me
in
reality
thy
precious
body
is
not
thy
face
here
and
that
tear
which
flows
down
thy
cheek
a
real
tear
yes
the
angel
of
eternal
justice
shall
receive
it
and
it
shall
be
the
ransom
of
the
soul
of
thais
art
thou
not
here
jesus
jesus
thy
loving
lips
open
thou
canst
speak
speak
i
hear
thee
and
thee
thais
happy
thais
listen
to
what
the
saviour
himself
says
to
thee
it
is
he
who
speaks
not
i
he
says
i
have
sought
thee
long
o
my
lost
sheep
i
have
found
thee
at
last
fly
from
me
no
more
let
me
take
thee
by
the
hands
poor
little
one
and
i
will
bear
thee
on
my
shoulders
to
the
heavenly
fold
come
my
thais
come
my
chosen
one
come
and
weep
with
me
and
paphnutius
fell
on
his
knees
his
eyes
filled
with
ecstasy
and
then
thais
saw
in
his
face
the
likeness
of
the
living
christ
o
vanished
days
of
my
childhood
she
sobbed
o
sweet
father
ahmes
good
saint
theodore
why
did
i
not
die
in
thy
white
mantle
whilst
thou
didst
bear
me
in
the
first
dawn
of
day
yet
fresh
from
the
waters
of
baptism
paphnutius
advanced
towards
her
crying
thou
art
baptised
o
divine
wisdom
o
providence
o
great
god
i
know
now
the
power
which
drew
me
to
thee
i
know
what
rendered
thee
so
dear
and
so
beautiful
in
my
eyes
it
was
the
virtue
of
the
baptismal
water
which
made
me
leave
the
shadow
of
god
where
i
lived
to
seek
thee
in
the
poisoned
air
where
men
dwell
a
drop
a
drop
no
doubt
of
the
water
which
washed
thy
body
has
been
sprinkled
in
my
face
come
o
my
sister
and
receive
from
thy
brother
the
kiss
of
and
the
monk
touched
with
his
lips
the
forehead
of
the
courtesan
then
he
was
silent
letting
god
speak
and
nothing
was
heard
in
the
grotto
of
nymphs
but
the
sobs
of
thais
mingled
with
the
rippling
of
the
running
water
she
wept
without
trying
to
stop
her
tears
when
two
black
slaves
appeared
loaded
with
stuffs
perfumes
and
garlands
it
was
hardly
the
right
time
to
weep
she
said
trying
to
smile
tears
redden
the
eyes
and
spoil
the
complexion
and
i
must
sup
tonight
with
some
friends
and
want
to
be
beautiful
for
there
will
be
women
there
quick
to
spy
out
marks
of
care
on
my
face
these
slaves
come
to
dress
me
withdraw
my
father
and
allow
them
to
do
their
work
they
are
clever
and
experienced
and
i
pay
them
well
for
their
services
you
see
that
one
who
wears
thick
rings
of
gold
and
shows
such
white
teeth
i
took
her
from
the
wife
of
the
paphnutius
had
at
first
a
thought
of
dissuading
thais
as
earnestly
as
he
could
from
going
to
this
supper
but
he
determined
to
act
prudently
and
asked
what
persons
she
would
meet
there
she
replied
that
there
would
be
the
host
old
cotta
the
prefect
of
the
fleet
nicias
and
several
other
philosophers
who
loved
an
argument
the
poet
callicrates
the
high
priest
of
serapis
some
young
men
whose
chief
amusement
was
training
horses
and
lastly
some
women
of
whom
there
was
little
to
be
said
except
that
they
were
young
then
by
a
supernatural
inspiration
go
amongst
them
thais
said
the
monk
go
but
i
will
not
leave
thee
i
will
go
with
thee
to
this
banquet
and
will
remain
by
thy
side
without
saying
a
she
burst
out
laughing
and
whilst
her
two
black
slaves
were
busy
dressing
her
she
cried
what
will
they
say
when
they
see
that
i
have
a
monk
of
the
thebaid
for
my
lover
the
banquet
when
followed
by
paphnutius
thais
entered
the
the
guests
were
already
for
the
most
part
assembled
and
reclining
on
their
couches
before
the
horseshoe
table
which
was
covered
with
glittering
vessels
in
the
centre
of
the
table
stood
a
silver
basin
surmounted
by
four
figures
of
satyrs
who
poured
out
from
on
the
boiled
fish
a
kind
of
pickle
in
which
they
floated
when
thais
appeared
acclamations
arose
from
all
sides
greetings
to
the
sister
of
the
graces
to
the
silent
melpomene
who
can
express
all
things
with
her
looks
salutation
to
the
of
gods
and
men
to
the
much
desired
to
her
who
gives
suffering
and
its
cure
to
the
pearl
of
racotis
to
the
rose
of
alexandria
she
waited
impatiently
till
this
torrent
of
praise
had
passed
and
then
said
to
cotta
the
host
lucius
i
have
brought
you
a
monk
of
the
desert
paphnutius
the
abbot
of
antinoe
he
is
a
great
saint
whose
words
burn
like
lucius
aurelius
cotta
the
prefect
of
the
fleet
rose
and
replied
you
are
welcome
paphnutius
you
who
profess
the
christian
faith
i
myself
have
some
respect
of
a
religion
that
has
now
become
imperial
the
divine
constantine
has
placed
your
in
the
front
rank
of
the
friends
of
the
empire
latin
wisdom
ought
in
fact
to
admit
your
christ
into
our
pantheon
it
was
a
maxim
of
our
forefathers
that
there
was
something
divine
in
every
god
but
no
more
of
that
let
us
drink
and
enjoy
ourselves
while
there
is
yet
old
cotta
spoke
tranquilly
he
had
just
studied
a
new
model
for
a
galley
and
had
finished
the
sixth
book
of
his
history
of
the
carthaginians
he
felt
sure
he
had
not
lost
his
day
and
was
satisfied
with
himself
and
the
gods
paphnutius
he
added
you
see
here
several
men
who
are
worthy
to
be
loved
hermodorus
the
high
priest
of
serapis
the
philosophers
dorion
nicias
and
zenothemis
the
poet
callicrates
young
chereas
and
young
aristobulus
both
sons
of
dear
old
comrades
and
near
them
philina
and
drosea
who
deserve
to
be
praised
for
their
nicias
embraced
paphnutius
and
whispered
in
his
ear
i
warned
you
brother
that
venus
was
powerful
it
is
her
gentle
force
that
has
brought
you
here
in
spite
of
yourself
listen
you
are
a
man
full
of
piety
but
if
you
do
not
confess
that
she
is
the
mother
of
the
gods
your
ruin
is
certain
do
you
know
that
the
old
mathematician
melanthes
used
to
say
i
can
not
demonstrate
the
properties
of
a
triangle
without
the
aid
of
venus
dorion
who
had
for
some
seconds
been
looking
at
the
suddenly
clapped
his
hands
and
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
it
is
he
friends
his
look
his
beard
his
tunic
it
is
he
himself
i
met
him
at
the
theatre
whilst
our
thais
was
acting
he
was
furiously
excited
and
spoke
with
violence
as
i
can
testify
he
is
an
honest
man
but
he
will
abuse
us
all
his
eloquence
is
terrible
if
marcus
is
the
plato
of
the
christians
paphnutius
is
the
demosthenes
epicurus
in
his
little
garden
never
heard
the
philina
and
drosea
however
devoured
thais
with
their
eyes
she
wore
on
her
fair
hair
a
wreath
of
pale
violets
each
flower
of
which
recalled
in
a
paler
hue
the
colour
of
her
eyes
so
that
the
flowers
looked
like
softened
glances
and
the
eyes
like
sparkling
flowers
it
was
the
peculiar
gift
of
this
woman
on
her
everything
lived
and
was
soul
and
harmony
her
robe
which
was
of
mauve
spangled
with
silver
trailed
in
long
folds
with
a
grace
that
was
almost
melancholy
and
was
not
relieved
by
either
bracelets
or
necklaces
the
chief
charm
of
her
appearance
was
her
beautiful
bare
arms
the
two
friends
were
obliged
to
admire
in
spite
of
themselves
the
robe
and
of
thais
though
they
said
nothing
to
her
on
the
subject
how
beautiful
you
are
said
philina
you
could
not
have
been
more
so
when
you
came
to
alexandria
yet
my
mother
who
remembers
seeing
you
then
says
there
were
few
women
who
were
worthy
to
be
compared
with
who
is
the
new
lover
you
have
brought
asked
drosea
he
has
a
strange
wild
appearance
if
there
are
shepherds
of
elephants
assuredly
he
must
resemble
one
where
did
you
find
such
a
friend
thais
was
it
amongst
the
troglodytes
who
live
under
the
earth
and
are
grimy
with
the
smoke
of
hades
but
philina
put
her
finger
on
drosea
s
lips
hush
the
mysteries
of
love
must
remain
secret
and
it
is
forbidden
to
know
them
for
my
own
part
certainly
i
would
rather
be
kissed
by
the
mouth
of
smoking
etna
than
by
the
lips
of
that
man
but
our
dear
thais
who
is
beautiful
and
adorable
as
the
goddesses
should
like
the
goddesses
grant
all
requests
and
not
like
us
only
those
of
nice
young
take
care
both
of
you
replied
thais
he
is
a
mage
and
an
enchanter
he
hears
words
that
are
whispered
and
even
thoughts
he
will
tear
out
your
heart
while
you
are
asleep
and
put
a
sponge
in
its
place
and
the
next
day
when
you
drink
water
you
will
be
choked
to
she
watched
them
grow
pale
then
she
turned
away
from
them
and
sat
on
a
couch
by
the
side
of
paphnutius
the
voice
of
cotta
kind
but
imperious
was
suddenly
heard
above
the
murmur
of
conversation
friends
let
each
take
his
place
slaves
pour
out
the
honeyed
wine
then
the
host
raising
his
cup
let
us
first
drink
to
the
divine
constantine
and
the
genius
of
the
empire
the
country
should
be
put
first
of
all
even
above
the
gods
for
it
contains
them
all
the
guests
raised
their
full
cups
to
their
lips
paphnutius
alone
did
not
drink
because
constantine
had
persecuted
the
nicaean
faith
and
because
the
country
of
the
christian
is
not
of
this
world
dorion
having
drunk
murmured
what
is
one
s
country
a
flowing
river
the
shores
change
and
the
waves
are
incessantly
i
know
dorion
replied
the
prefect
of
the
fleet
that
you
care
little
for
the
civic
virtues
and
you
think
that
the
sage
ought
to
hold
himself
aloof
from
all
affairs
i
think
on
the
contrary
that
an
honest
man
should
desire
nothing
better
than
to
fill
a
responsible
post
in
the
state
the
state
is
a
noble
hermodorus
the
high
priest
of
serapis
spoke
next
dorion
has
asked
what
is
one
s
country
i
will
reply
that
the
altars
of
the
gods
and
the
tombs
of
ancestors
make
one
s
country
a
man
is
a
by
association
of
memories
and
young
aristobulus
interrupted
hermodorus
by
castor
i
saw
a
splendid
horse
it
belonged
to
demophoon
it
has
a
fine
head
small
jaw
and
strong
forelegs
it
carries
its
neck
high
and
proud
like
a
but
young
chereas
shook
his
head
it
is
not
such
a
good
horse
as
you
say
aristobulus
its
hoofs
are
thin
and
the
pasterns
are
too
low
the
animal
will
soon
go
they
were
continuing
their
dispute
when
drosea
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
oh
i
nearly
swallowed
a
as
long
and
much
sharper
than
a
style
luckily
i
was
able
to
get
it
out
of
my
throat
in
time
the
gods
love
me
did
you
say
drosea
that
the
gods
loved
you
asked
nicias
smiling
then
they
must
share
the
same
infirmities
as
men
love
presupposes
unhappiness
on
the
part
of
whoever
suffers
from
it
and
is
a
proof
of
weakness
the
affection
they
feel
for
drosea
is
a
great
proof
of
the
imperfection
of
the
at
these
words
drosea
flew
into
a
great
rage
nicias
your
remarks
are
foolish
and
not
to
the
point
but
that
is
your
character
you
never
understand
what
is
said
and
reply
in
words
devoid
of
nicias
smiled
again
talk
away
talk
away
drosea
whatever
you
say
we
are
glad
every
time
you
open
your
mouth
your
teeth
are
so
pretty
at
that
moment
a
old
man
negligently
dressed
walking
slowly
with
his
head
high
entered
the
room
and
gazed
at
the
guests
quietly
cotta
made
a
sign
to
him
to
take
a
place
by
his
side
on
the
same
couch
eucrites
he
said
you
are
welcome
have
you
composed
a
new
treatise
on
philosophy
this
month
that
would
make
if
i
calculate
correctly
the
that
has
proceeded
from
the
nile
reed
you
direct
with
an
attic
eucrites
replied
stroking
his
silver
beard
the
nightingale
was
created
to
sing
and
i
was
created
to
praise
the
immortal
dorion
let
us
respectfully
salute
in
eucrites
the
last
of
the
stoics
grave
and
white
he
stands
in
the
midst
of
us
like
the
image
of
an
ancestor
he
is
solitary
amidst
a
crowd
of
men
and
the
words
he
utters
are
not
heard
eucrites
you
deceive
yourself
dorion
the
philosophy
of
virtue
is
not
dead
i
have
numerous
disciples
in
alexandria
rome
and
constantinople
many
of
the
slaves
and
some
of
the
nephews
of
caesar
now
know
how
to
govern
themselves
to
live
independently
and
being
unconcerned
with
all
affairs
they
enjoy
boundless
happiness
many
of
them
have
revived
in
their
own
person
epictetus
and
marcus
aurelius
but
if
it
were
true
that
virtue
were
for
ever
extinguished
upon
the
earth
in
what
way
would
the
loss
of
it
affect
my
happiness
since
it
did
not
depend
on
me
whether
it
existed
or
perished
only
fools
dorion
place
their
happiness
out
of
their
own
power
i
desire
nothing
that
the
gods
do
not
wish
and
i
desire
all
that
they
do
wish
by
that
means
i
render
myself
like
unto
them
and
share
their
infallible
content
if
virtue
perishes
i
consent
that
it
should
perish
and
that
consent
fills
me
with
joy
as
the
supreme
effort
of
my
reason
or
my
courage
in
all
things
my
wisdom
will
copy
the
divine
wisdom
and
the
copy
will
be
more
valuable
than
the
model
it
will
have
cost
greater
care
and
more
work
nicias
i
understand
you
put
yourself
on
the
same
level
as
divine
providence
but
if
virtue
consists
only
in
effort
eucrites
and
in
that
intense
application
by
which
the
disciples
of
zeno
pretend
to
render
themselves
equal
to
the
gods
the
frog
which
swelled
itself
out
to
try
and
become
as
big
as
the
ox
accomplished
a
masterpiece
of
stoicism
eucrites
you
jest
nicias
and
as
usual
you
excel
in
ridicule
but
if
the
ox
of
which
you
speak
is
really
a
god
like
apis
or
like
that
subterranean
ox
whose
high
priest
i
see
here
and
if
the
frog
being
wisely
inspired
succeed
in
equalling
it
would
it
not
be
in
fact
more
virtuous
than
the
ox
and
could
you
refrain
from
admiring
such
a
courageous
little
animal
four
servants
placed
on
the
table
a
wild
pig
still
covered
with
its
bristles
little
pigs
made
of
pastry
surrounded
the
animal
as
though
they
would
suckle
to
show
that
it
was
a
sow
zenothemis
turning
towards
the
monk
said
friends
a
guest
has
come
hither
to
join
us
the
illustrious
paphnutius
who
leads
such
an
extraordinary
life
of
solitude
is
our
unexpected
cotta
you
may
even
add
zenothemis
that
the
place
of
honour
is
due
to
him
because
he
came
without
being
invited
zenothemis
therefore
we
ought
my
dear
lucius
to
make
him
the
more
welcome
and
strive
to
do
that
which
would
be
most
agreeable
to
him
now
it
is
certain
that
such
a
man
cares
less
for
the
perfumes
of
meat
than
for
the
perfumes
of
fine
thoughts
we
shall
doubtless
please
him
by
discussing
the
doctrine
he
professes
which
is
that
of
jesus
crucified
for
my
own
part
i
shall
the
more
willingly
discuss
this
doctrine
because
it
keenly
interests
me
on
account
of
the
number
and
the
diversity
of
the
allegories
it
contains
if
one
may
guess
at
the
spirit
by
the
letter
it
is
filled
with
truths
and
i
consider
that
the
christian
books
abound
in
divine
revelations
but
i
should
not
paphnutius
grant
equal
merit
to
the
jewish
books
they
were
inspired
not
as
it
was
said
by
the
spirit
of
god
but
by
an
evil
genius
iaveh
who
dictated
them
was
one
of
those
spirits
who
people
the
lower
air
and
cause
the
greater
part
of
the
evils
from
which
we
suffer
but
he
surpassed
all
the
others
in
ignorance
and
ferocity
on
the
contrary
the
serpent
with
golden
wings
which
twined
its
azure
coils
round
the
tree
of
knowledge
was
made
up
of
light
and
love
a
combat
between
these
two
powers
the
one
of
light
and
the
other
of
darkness
was
therefore
inevitable
it
occurred
soon
after
the
creation
of
the
world
god
had
hardly
begun
to
rest
after
his
labors
adam
and
eve
the
first
man
and
the
first
woman
lived
happy
and
naked
in
the
garden
of
eden
when
iaveh
conceived
to
their
misfortune
the
design
of
governing
them
and
all
the
generations
which
eve
already
bore
in
her
splendid
loins
as
he
possessed
neither
the
compass
nor
the
lyre
and
was
equally
ignorant
of
the
science
which
commands
and
the
art
which
persuades
he
frightened
these
two
poor
children
by
hideous
apparitions
capricious
threats
and
adam
and
eve
feeling
his
shadow
upon
them
pressed
closer
to
one
another
and
their
love
waxed
stronger
in
fear
the
serpent
took
pity
on
them
and
determined
to
instruct
them
in
order
that
possessing
knowledge
they
might
no
longer
be
misled
by
lies
such
an
undertaking
required
extreme
prudence
and
the
frailty
of
the
first
human
couple
rendered
it
almost
hopeless
the
demon
essayed
it
however
without
the
knowledge
of
iaveh
who
pretended
to
see
everything
but
in
reality
was
not
very
he
approached
these
two
beings
and
charmed
their
eyes
by
the
splendour
of
his
coat
and
the
brilliancy
of
his
wings
then
he
interested
their
minds
by
forming
before
them
with
his
body
definite
figures
such
as
the
circle
the
ellipse
and
the
spiral
the
wonderful
properties
of
which
have
since
been
recognised
by
the
greeks
adam
meditated
on
these
figures
more
than
eve
did
but
when
the
serpent
began
to
speak
and
taught
the
most
sublime
truths
those
which
can
not
be
demonstrated
he
found
that
adam
being
made
of
red
earth
was
of
too
dull
a
nature
to
understand
these
subtle
distinctions
but
that
eve
on
the
contrary
being
more
tender
and
more
sensitive
was
easily
impressed
therefore
he
conversed
with
her
alone
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
in
order
to
initiate
her
first
dorion
permit
me
zenothemis
to
interrupt
you
i
speedily
recognised
in
the
myth
you
have
explained
to
us
an
episode
in
the
war
of
pallas
athene
against
the
giants
iaveh
much
resembles
typhoon
and
pallas
is
represented
by
the
athenians
with
a
serpent
at
her
side
but
what
you
have
said
causes
me
considerable
doubt
as
to
the
intelligence
or
good
faith
of
the
serpent
of
whom
you
have
spoken
if
he
had
really
possessed
knowledge
would
he
have
entrusted
it
to
a
woman
s
little
head
which
was
incapable
of
containing
it
i
should
rather
consider
that
he
was
like
iaveh
ignorant
and
a
liar
and
that
he
chose
eve
because
she
was
easily
seduced
and
he
imagined
that
adam
would
have
more
intelligence
and
perception
zenothemis
learn
dorion
that
it
is
not
by
perception
and
intelligence
but
by
sensibility
that
the
highest
and
purest
truths
are
reached
that
is
why
women
who
generally
are
less
reflective
but
more
sensitive
than
men
rise
more
easily
to
the
knowledge
of
things
divine
in
them
is
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
it
is
not
without
reason
that
apollo
citharedes
and
jesus
of
nazareth
are
sometimes
represented
clad
like
women
in
flowing
robes
the
initiator
was
therefore
wise
whatever
you
may
say
to
the
contrary
dorion
in
bestowing
light
not
on
the
duller
adam
but
on
eve
who
was
whiter
than
milk
or
the
stars
she
freely
listened
to
him
and
allowed
herself
to
be
led
to
the
tree
of
knowledge
the
branches
of
which
rose
to
heaven
and
which
was
bathed
with
the
divine
spirit
as
with
a
dew
this
tree
was
covered
with
leaves
which
spoke
all
the
languages
of
future
races
of
men
and
their
united
voices
formed
a
perfect
harmony
its
abundant
fruit
gave
to
the
initiated
who
tasted
it
the
knowledge
of
metals
stones
and
plants
and
also
of
physical
and
moral
laws
but
this
fruit
was
like
fire
and
those
who
feared
suffering
and
death
did
not
dare
to
put
it
to
their
lips
now
as
she
had
listened
attentively
to
the
lessons
of
the
serpent
eve
despised
these
empty
terrors
and
wished
to
taste
the
fruit
which
gave
the
knowledge
of
god
but
as
she
loved
adam
and
did
not
wish
him
to
be
inferior
to
her
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
the
wonderful
tree
then
she
picked
one
of
the
burning
apples
bit
it
and
proffered
it
to
her
companion
unfortunately
iaveh
who
was
by
chance
walking
in
the
garden
surprised
them
and
seeing
that
they
had
become
wise
he
fell
into
a
most
ungovernable
rage
it
is
in
his
jealous
fits
that
he
is
most
to
be
feared
assembling
all
his
forces
he
created
such
a
turmoil
in
the
lower
air
that
these
two
weak
beings
were
terrified
the
fruit
fell
from
the
man
s
hand
and
the
woman
clinging
to
the
neck
of
her
luckless
husband
said
i
too
will
be
ignorant
and
suffer
with
the
triumphant
iaveh
kept
adam
and
eve
and
all
their
seed
in
a
condition
of
hebetude
and
terror
his
art
which
consisted
only
in
being
able
to
make
huge
meteors
triumphed
over
the
science
of
the
serpent
who
was
a
musician
and
geometrician
he
made
men
unjust
ignorant
and
cruel
and
caused
evil
to
reign
in
the
earth
he
persecuted
cain
and
his
sons
because
they
were
skilful
workmen
he
exterminated
the
philistines
because
they
composed
orphic
poems
and
fables
like
those
of
aesop
he
was
the
implacable
enemy
of
science
and
beauty
and
for
long
ages
the
human
race
expiated
in
blood
and
tears
the
defeat
of
the
winged
serpent
fortunately
there
arose
among
the
greeks
learned
men
such
as
pythagoras
and
plato
who
recovered
by
the
force
of
genius
the
figures
and
the
ideas
which
the
enemy
of
iaveh
had
vainly
tried
to
teach
the
first
woman
the
soul
of
the
serpent
was
in
them
and
that
is
why
the
serpent
as
dorion
has
said
is
honoured
by
the
athenians
finally
in
these
latter
days
there
appeared
under
human
form
three
celestial
spirits
jesus
of
galilee
basilides
and
valentinus
to
whom
it
was
given
to
pluck
the
finest
fruits
of
that
tree
of
knowledge
whose
roots
pass
through
all
the
earth
and
whose
top
reaches
to
the
highest
heaven
i
have
said
all
this
in
vindication
of
the
christians
to
whom
the
errors
of
the
jews
are
too
often
imputed
dorion
if
i
understood
you
aright
zenothemis
you
said
that
three
wonderful
men
jesus
basilides
and
valentinus
had
discovered
secrets
which
had
remained
hidden
from
pythagoras
and
plato
and
all
the
philosophers
of
greece
and
even
from
the
divine
epicurus
who
however
has
freed
men
from
the
dread
of
empty
terrors
you
would
greatly
oblige
me
by
telling
me
by
what
means
these
three
mortals
acquired
knowledge
which
had
eluded
the
most
contemplative
sages
zenothemis
must
i
repeat
to
you
dorion
that
science
and
cogitation
are
but
the
first
steps
to
knowledge
and
that
ecstasy
alone
leads
to
eternal
truth
hermodorus
it
is
true
zenothemis
that
the
soul
is
nourished
on
ecstasy
as
the
cicada
is
nourished
on
dew
but
we
may
even
say
more
the
mind
alone
is
capable
of
perfect
rapture
for
man
is
of
a
threefold
nature
composed
of
material
body
of
a
soul
which
is
more
subtle
but
also
material
and
of
an
incorruptible
mind
when
emerging
from
the
body
as
from
a
palace
suddenly
given
over
to
silence
and
solitude
and
flying
through
the
gardens
of
the
soul
the
mind
diffuses
itself
in
god
it
tastes
the
delights
of
an
anticipated
death
or
rather
of
a
future
life
for
to
die
is
to
live
and
in
that
condition
partaking
of
divine
purity
it
possesses
both
infinite
joy
and
complete
knowledge
it
enters
into
the
unity
which
is
all
it
is
perfected
nicias
that
is
very
fine
but
to
say
the
truth
hermodorus
i
do
not
see
much
difference
between
all
and
nothing
words
even
seem
to
fail
to
make
the
distinction
infinity
is
terribly
like
nothingness
they
are
both
inconceivable
to
the
mind
in
my
opinion
perfection
costs
too
dear
we
pay
for
it
with
all
our
being
and
to
possess
it
must
cease
to
exist
that
is
a
calamity
from
which
god
himself
is
not
free
for
the
philosophers
are
doing
their
best
to
perfect
him
after
all
if
we
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
be
we
are
equally
ignorant
what
it
is
to
we
know
nothing
it
is
said
that
it
is
impossible
for
men
to
agree
on
this
question
i
believe
in
spite
of
our
noisy
disputes
that
it
is
on
the
contrary
impossible
for
men
not
to
become
some
day
all
at
unity
buried
under
the
mass
of
contradictions
a
pelion
on
ossa
which
they
themselves
have
raised
cotta
i
am
very
fond
of
philosophy
and
study
it
in
my
leisure
time
but
i
never
understand
it
well
except
in
cicero
s
books
slaves
pour
out
the
honeyed
wine
callicrates
it
is
a
singular
thing
but
when
i
am
hungry
i
think
of
the
time
when
the
tragic
poets
sat
at
the
boards
of
good
tyrants
and
my
mouth
waters
but
when
i
have
tasted
the
excellent
wine
that
you
give
us
so
abundantly
generous
lucius
i
dream
of
nothing
but
civil
wars
and
heroic
combats
i
blush
to
live
in
such
inglorious
times
i
invoke
the
goddess
of
liberty
and
i
pour
out
my
blood
in
imagination
with
the
last
romans
on
the
field
of
philippi
cotta
in
the
days
of
the
decline
of
the
republic
my
ancestors
died
with
brutus
for
liberty
but
there
is
reason
to
suspect
that
what
the
roman
people
called
liberty
was
only
in
reality
the
right
to
govern
themselves
i
do
not
deny
that
liberty
is
the
greatest
boon
a
nation
can
have
but
the
longer
i
live
the
more
i
am
persuaded
that
only
a
strong
government
can
bestow
it
on
the
citizens
for
forty
years
i
have
filled
high
positions
in
the
state
and
my
long
experience
has
shown
me
that
when
the
ruling
power
is
weak
the
people
are
oppressed
those
therefore
who
like
the
great
majority
of
rhetoricians
try
to
weaken
the
government
commit
an
abominable
crime
an
autocrat
who
governs
by
his
single
will
may
sometimes
cause
most
deplorable
results
but
if
he
governs
by
popular
consent
there
is
no
remedy
possible
before
the
majesty
of
the
roman
arms
had
bestowed
peace
upon
all
the
world
the
only
nations
which
were
happy
were
those
which
were
ruled
over
by
intelligent
despots
hermodorus
for
my
part
lucius
i
believe
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
good
form
of
government
and
that
we
shall
never
discover
one
because
the
greeks
who
had
so
many
excellent
ideas
were
never
able
to
find
one
in
that
respect
therefore
all
hope
of
ultimate
success
is
taken
from
us
unmistakable
signs
show
that
the
world
is
about
to
fall
into
ignorance
and
barbarism
it
has
been
our
lot
lucius
to
witness
terrible
events
of
all
the
mental
satisfactions
which
intelligence
learning
and
virtue
can
give
all
that
remains
is
the
cruel
pleasure
of
watching
ourselves
die
cotta
it
is
true
that
the
rapacity
of
the
people
and
the
boldness
of
the
barbarians
are
threatening
evils
but
with
a
good
fleet
a
good
army
and
plenty
of
money
hermodorus
what
is
the
use
of
deceiving
ourselves
the
dying
empire
will
become
an
easy
prey
to
the
barbarians
cities
which
were
built
by
hellenic
genius
or
latin
patience
will
soon
be
sacked
by
drunken
savages
neither
art
nor
philosophy
will
exist
any
longer
on
the
earth
the
statues
of
the
gods
will
be
overturned
in
the
temples
and
in
men
s
hearts
as
well
darkness
will
overcome
all
minds
and
the
world
will
die
can
we
believe
that
the
sarmatians
will
ever
devote
themselves
to
intelligent
work
that
the
germani
will
cultivate
music
and
philosophy
and
that
the
quadi
and
the
marcomani
will
adore
the
immortal
gods
no
we
are
sliding
toward
the
abyss
our
old
egypt
which
was
the
cradle
of
the
world
will
be
its
burial
vault
serapis
the
god
of
death
will
receive
the
last
adoration
of
mortals
and
i
shall
have
been
the
last
priest
of
the
last
god
at
this
moment
a
strange
figure
raised
the
tapestry
and
the
guests
saw
before
them
a
little
hunchback
whose
bald
skull
rose
in
a
point
he
was
clad
in
the
asiatic
fashion
in
a
blue
tunic
and
wore
round
his
legs
like
the
barbarians
red
breeches
spangled
with
gold
stars
on
seeing
him
paphnutius
recognised
marcus
the
arian
and
fearing
lest
a
thunderbolt
should
fall
from
heaven
he
covered
his
head
with
his
arms
and
grew
pale
with
fright
at
this
banquet
of
the
demons
neither
the
blasphemies
of
the
pagans
nor
the
horrible
errors
of
the
philosophers
had
had
any
effect
on
him
but
the
mere
presence
of
the
heretic
quenched
his
courage
he
would
have
fled
but
his
eyes
met
those
of
thais
and
he
felt
at
once
strengthened
he
read
in
her
soul
that
she
who
was
predestined
to
become
a
saint
already
protected
him
he
seized
the
skirt
of
her
long
flowing
robe
and
inwardly
prayed
to
the
saviour
jesus
a
murmur
of
acclamation
welcomed
the
arrival
of
the
personage
who
had
been
called
the
christian
plato
hermodorus
was
the
first
to
speak
most
illustrious
marcus
we
rejoice
to
see
you
amongst
us
and
it
may
be
said
that
you
come
at
the
right
moment
we
know
nothing
of
the
christian
doctrine
beyond
what
is
publicly
taught
now
it
is
certain
that
a
philosopher
like
you
can
not
think
as
the
vulgar
think
and
we
are
curious
to
know
your
opinion
of
the
principal
mysteries
of
the
religion
you
profess
our
dear
friend
zenothemis
who
as
you
know
is
always
hunting
for
symbolic
meanings
just
now
questioned
the
illustrious
paphnutius
concerning
the
jewish
books
but
paphnutius
made
no
reply
and
we
should
not
be
surprised
at
that
as
our
guest
has
made
a
vow
of
silence
and
god
has
sealed
his
tongue
in
the
desert
but
you
marcus
who
have
spoken
at
the
christian
synods
and
even
at
the
councils
of
the
divine
constantine
can
if
you
wish
satisfy
our
curiosity
by
revealing
to
us
the
philosophic
truths
which
are
wrapped
up
in
the
christian
fables
is
not
the
first
of
these
truths
the
existence
of
an
only
god
in
whom
for
my
part
i
fervently
believe
marcus
yes
venerable
brethren
i
believe
in
an
only
god
not
begotten
the
only
eternal
the
origin
of
all
things
nicias
we
know
marcus
that
your
god
created
the
world
that
must
certainly
have
been
a
great
crisis
in
his
existence
he
had
already
existed
an
eternity
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
it
but
i
must
in
justice
confess
that
his
situation
was
a
most
difficult
one
he
must
continue
inactive
if
he
would
remain
perfect
and
must
act
if
he
would
prove
to
himself
his
own
existence
you
assure
me
that
he
decided
to
act
i
am
willing
to
believe
you
although
it
was
an
unpardonable
imprudence
on
the
part
of
a
perfect
god
but
tell
us
marcus
how
he
set
about
making
the
world
marcus
those
who
without
being
christians
possess
like
hermodorus
and
zenothemis
the
principles
of
knowledge
are
aware
that
god
did
not
create
the
world
personally
without
an
intermediary
he
gave
birth
to
an
only
son
by
whom
all
things
were
made
hermodorus
that
is
quite
true
marcus
and
this
son
is
worshipped
under
the
various
names
of
hermes
mithra
adonis
apollo
and
jesus
marcus
i
should
not
be
a
christian
if
i
gave
him
any
other
names
than
those
of
jesus
christ
and
saviour
he
is
the
true
son
of
god
but
he
is
not
eternal
since
he
had
a
beginning
as
to
thinking
that
he
existed
before
he
was
begotten
we
must
leave
that
absurdity
to
the
nicaean
mules
and
the
obstinate
ass
who
too
long
governed
the
church
of
alexandria
under
the
accursed
name
of
athanasius
at
these
words
paphnutius
white
with
horror
and
his
face
bedewed
with
the
sweat
of
agony
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
but
maintained
a
sublime
silence
marcus
continued
it
is
clear
that
the
foolish
nicene
creed
is
a
treason
against
the
majesty
of
the
only
god
by
compelling
him
to
share
his
indivisible
attributes
with
his
own
emanation
the
mediator
by
whom
all
things
were
made
cease
jesting
at
the
true
god
of
the
christians
nicias
and
learn
that
like
the
lilies
of
the
field
he
toils
not
neither
does
he
spin
it
was
not
he
who
was
the
worker
it
was
his
only
son
jesus
who
having
created
the
world
came
afterwards
to
repair
his
handiwork
for
the
creation
could
not
be
perfect
and
evil
was
necessarily
mingled
with
nicias
what
is
good
and
what
is
evil
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
during
which
hermodorus
his
arm
extended
on
the
cloth
pointed
to
a
little
ass
in
corinthian
metal
which
bore
two
baskets
the
one
containing
white
olives
the
other
black
olives
you
see
these
olives
he
said
the
contrast
between
the
colours
is
pleasant
to
the
eye
and
we
are
content
that
these
should
be
light
and
those
should
be
dark
but
if
they
were
endowed
with
thought
and
knowledge
the
white
would
say
it
is
good
for
an
olive
to
be
white
it
is
bad
for
it
to
be
black
and
the
black
olives
would
hate
the
white
olives
we
judge
better
for
we
are
as
much
above
them
as
the
gods
are
above
us
for
man
who
only
sees
a
part
of
things
evil
is
an
evil
for
god
who
understands
all
things
evil
is
a
good
doubtless
ugliness
is
ugly
and
not
beautiful
but
if
all
were
beautiful
the
whole
would
not
be
beautiful
it
is
then
well
that
there
should
be
evil
as
the
second
plato
far
greater
than
the
first
has
eucrites
let
us
talk
more
morally
evil
is
an
evil
not
for
the
world
of
which
it
can
not
destroy
the
indestructible
harmony
but
for
the
sinner
who
does
it
and
can
not
help
doing
it
cotta
by
jupiter
that
is
a
good
argument
eucrites
the
world
is
a
tragedy
by
an
excellent
poet
god
who
composed
it
has
intended
each
of
us
to
play
a
part
in
it
if
he
wills
that
you
shall
be
a
beggar
a
prince
or
a
cripple
make
the
best
of
the
part
assigned
you
nicias
assuredly
it
would
be
well
that
the
cripple
should
limp
like
hephaistos
it
would
be
well
that
the
madman
should
indulge
in
all
the
fury
of
ajax
that
the
incestuous
woman
should
repeat
the
crimes
of
phaedra
that
the
traitor
should
betray
that
the
rascal
should
lie
and
the
murderer
kill
and
when
the
piece
was
played
all
the
actor
kings
just
men
bloody
tyrants
pious
virgins
immodest
wives
citizens
and
cowardly
assassins
should
receive
from
the
poet
an
equal
share
in
the
felicitations
eucrites
you
distort
my
thought
nicias
and
change
a
beautiful
young
girl
into
a
hideous
gorgon
i
am
sorry
for
you
if
you
are
so
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
gods
of
justice
and
of
the
eternal
laws
zenothemis
for
my
part
friends
i
believe
in
the
reality
of
good
and
evil
but
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
not
a
single
human
action
were
it
even
the
kiss
of
judas
which
does
not
bear
within
itself
the
germ
of
redemption
evil
contributes
to
the
ultimate
salvation
of
men
and
in
that
respect
issues
from
good
and
shares
the
merits
belonging
to
good
this
has
been
admirably
expressed
by
the
christians
in
the
myth
concerning
the
man
with
red
hair
who
in
order
to
betray
his
master
gave
him
the
kiss
of
peace
and
by
such
act
assured
the
salvation
of
men
therefore
nothing
is
in
my
opinion
more
unjust
and
absurd
than
the
hate
with
which
certain
disciples
of
paul
the
tentmaker
pursue
the
most
unfortunate
of
the
apostles
of
jesus
without
realising
that
the
kiss
of
iscariot
prophesied
by
jesus
himself
was
necessary
according
to
their
own
doctrine
for
the
redemption
of
men
and
that
if
judas
had
not
received
the
thirty
pieces
the
divine
wisdom
would
have
been
impugned
providence
frustrated
its
designs
upset
and
the
world
given
over
to
evil
ignorance
and
death
marcus
divine
wisdom
foresaw
that
judas
though
he
was
not
obliged
to
give
the
traitor
s
kiss
would
give
it
notwithstanding
it
thus
employed
the
sin
of
iscariot
as
a
stone
in
the
marvellous
edifice
of
the
redemption
zenothemis
i
spoke
just
now
marcus
as
though
i
believed
that
the
redemption
of
men
had
been
accomplished
by
jesus
crucified
because
i
know
that
such
is
the
belief
of
the
christians
and
i
borrowed
their
opinion
that
i
might
the
better
show
the
mistake
of
those
who
believe
in
the
eternal
damnation
of
judas
but
in
reality
jesus
was
in
my
eyes
but
the
precursor
of
basilides
and
valentinus
as
to
the
mystery
of
the
redemption
i
will
tell
you
my
dear
friends
if
you
are
at
all
curious
to
hear
it
how
it
was
really
accomplished
on
earth
the
guests
made
a
sign
of
assent
like
the
athenian
virgins
with
the
baskets
sacred
to
ceres
twelve
young
girls
bearing
on
their
heads
baskets
filled
with
pomegranates
and
apples
entered
the
room
with
a
light
step
in
time
to
the
music
of
an
invisible
flute
they
placed
the
baskets
on
the
table
the
flute
ceased
and
zenothemis
spoke
as
follows
when
eunoia
the
thought
of
god
had
created
the
world
she
confided
the
government
of
the
earth
to
the
angels
but
they
did
not
preserve
the
dispassion
befitting
masters
seeing
that
the
daughters
of
men
were
fair
they
surprised
them
in
the
evening
by
the
wellside
and
united
themselves
to
them
from
these
unions
sprang
a
turbulent
race
who
covered
the
earth
with
injustice
and
cruelty
and
the
dust
of
the
roads
drank
up
the
blood
of
the
innocent
the
sight
of
this
caused
eunoia
infinite
grief
see
what
i
have
done
she
sighed
leaning
towards
the
world
my
poor
children
are
plunged
in
misery
and
by
my
fault
their
suffering
is
my
crime
and
i
will
expiate
it
god
himself
who
only
thinks
through
me
would
be
powerless
to
restore
them
to
their
pristine
purity
that
which
is
done
is
done
and
the
creation
will
remain
for
ever
imperfect
but
at
least
i
will
not
forsake
my
creatures
if
i
can
not
make
them
happy
like
me
i
can
make
myself
unhappy
like
them
since
i
committed
the
mistake
of
giving
them
bodies
which
dishonour
them
i
will
myself
assume
a
body
like
unto
theirs
and
will
go
and
live
amongst
having
thus
spoken
eunoia
descended
to
the
earth
and
was
incarnate
in
the
breast
of
a
woman
of
argos
she
was
born
small
and
feeble
and
received
the
name
of
helen
she
submitted
to
all
the
labours
of
this
life
but
soon
grew
in
grace
and
beauty
and
became
the
most
desired
of
women
as
she
had
determined
in
order
that
her
mortal
body
might
be
tried
by
the
most
supreme
defilements
an
inert
prey
to
lascivious
and
violent
men
she
suffered
rape
and
adultery
in
expiation
of
all
the
adulteries
all
the
violences
all
the
iniquities
and
caused
by
her
beauty
the
ruin
of
nations
that
god
might
pardon
the
sins
of
the
universe
and
never
was
the
celestial
thought
never
was
eunoia
so
adorable
as
in
those
days
when
as
a
woman
she
prostituted
herself
to
heroes
and
shepherds
the
poets
surmised
her
divinity
when
they
painted
her
so
peaceful
superb
and
fatal
and
when
they
addressed
that
invocation
to
her
a
soul
as
serene
as
a
calm
upon
the
thus
was
eunoia
led
by
pity
into
evil
and
suffering
she
died
and
the
argives
still
show
her
tomb
for
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
know
death
after
lust
and
taste
the
bitter
fruit
she
had
sown
but
emerging
from
the
decomposed
flesh
of
helen
she
became
incarnate
again
as
a
woman
and
again
suffered
every
form
of
insult
and
outrage
thus
passing
from
body
to
body
throughout
all
the
evil
ages
she
takes
upon
her
the
sins
of
the
world
her
sacrifice
will
not
be
in
vain
joined
to
us
by
the
bonds
of
the
flesh
loving
us
and
weeping
with
us
she
will
effect
her
redemption
and
ours
and
will
carry
us
clinging
to
her
white
breast
into
the
peace
of
the
regained
hermodorus
this
myth
was
not
unknown
to
me
i
remembered
having
heard
that
in
one
of
her
metamorphoses
the
divine
helen
lived
with
the
magician
simon
in
the
reign
of
the
emperor
tiberius
i
thought
however
that
her
perdition
was
involuntary
and
that
she
was
dragged
down
by
the
angels
in
their
fall
zenothemis
it
is
true
hermodorus
that
men
who
were
not
properly
initiated
in
the
mysteries
have
imagined
that
the
sad
eunoia
was
not
a
party
to
her
own
downfall
but
if
it
were
as
they
assert
eunoia
would
not
be
the
expiating
courtesan
the
victim
covered
with
stains
of
all
sorts
the
bread
steeped
in
the
wine
of
our
shame
the
pleasant
offering
the
meritorious
sacrifice
the
holocaust
the
smoke
of
which
rises
to
god
if
they
were
not
voluntary
there
would
be
no
merit
in
her
sins
callicrates
does
anyone
know
zenothemis
in
what
country
under
what
name
in
what
adorable
form
this
helen
is
living
now
zenothemis
a
man
would
have
to
be
very
wise
indeed
to
discover
such
a
secret
and
wisdom
callicrates
is
not
given
to
poets
who
live
in
the
rude
world
of
forms
and
amuse
themselves
like
children
with
sounds
and
empty
shows
callicrates
beware
of
offending
the
gods
impious
zenothemis
the
poets
are
dear
to
them
the
first
laws
were
dictated
in
verse
by
the
immortals
themselves
and
the
oracles
of
the
gods
are
poems
hymns
have
a
pleasant
sound
to
celestial
ears
who
does
not
know
that
the
poets
are
prophets
and
that
nothing
is
hidden
from
them
being
a
poet
myself
and
crowned
with
apollo
s
laurel
i
will
make
known
to
all
the
last
incarnation
of
eunoia
the
eternal
helen
is
close
to
us
she
is
looking
at
us
and
we
are
looking
at
her
you
see
that
woman
reclining
on
the
cushions
of
her
couch
so
beautiful
and
so
contemplative
whose
eyes
shed
tears
and
whose
lips
abound
with
kisses
it
is
she
lovely
as
in
the
time
of
priam
and
the
halcyon
days
of
asia
eunoia
is
now
called
thais
philina
what
do
you
say
callicrates
our
dear
thais
knew
paris
menelaus
and
the
achaians
who
fought
before
ilion
was
the
trojan
horse
big
thais
aristobulus
who
speaks
of
a
horse
i
have
drunk
like
a
thracian
cried
chereas
and
he
rolled
under
the
table
callicrates
raising
his
cup
cried
if
we
drink
like
desperate
men
we
die
unavenged
old
cotta
was
asleep
and
his
bald
head
nodded
slowly
above
his
broad
shoulders
for
some
time
past
dorion
had
seemed
to
be
greatly
excited
under
his
philosophic
cloak
he
reeled
up
to
the
couch
of
thais
thais
i
love
you
although
it
is
unseemly
in
me
to
love
a
thais
why
did
you
not
love
me
before
dorion
because
i
had
not
supped
thais
but
i
my
poor
friend
have
drunk
nothing
but
water
therefore
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
do
not
love
you
dorion
did
not
wait
to
hear
more
but
made
towards
drosea
who
had
made
a
sign
to
him
in
order
to
get
him
away
from
her
friend
zenothemis
took
the
place
he
had
left
and
gave
thais
a
kiss
on
the
mouth
thais
i
thought
you
more
virtuous
zenothemis
i
am
perfect
and
the
perfect
are
subject
to
no
laws
thais
but
are
you
not
afraid
of
sullying
your
soul
in
a
woman
s
arms
zenothemis
the
body
may
yield
to
lust
without
the
soul
being
concerned
thais
go
away
i
wish
to
be
loved
with
body
and
soul
all
these
philosophers
are
old
goats
the
lamps
died
out
one
by
one
the
pale
rays
of
dawn
which
entered
between
the
openings
of
the
hangings
shone
on
the
livid
faces
and
swollen
eyes
of
the
guests
aristobulus
was
sleeping
soundly
by
the
side
of
chereas
and
in
his
dreams
devoting
all
his
grooms
to
the
ravens
zenothemis
pressed
in
his
arms
the
yielding
philina
dorion
poured
on
the
naked
bosom
of
drosea
drops
of
wine
which
rolled
like
rubies
on
the
white
breast
which
was
shaking
with
laughter
and
the
philosopher
tried
to
catch
these
drops
with
his
lips
as
they
rolled
on
the
slippery
flesh
eucrites
rose
and
placing
his
arm
on
the
shoulder
of
nicias
led
him
to
the
end
of
the
hall
friend
he
said
smiling
if
you
can
still
think
at
all
of
what
are
you
thinking
i
think
that
the
love
of
women
is
like
a
garden
of
what
do
you
mean
by
that
do
you
not
know
eucrites
that
women
make
little
gardens
on
the
terraces
in
which
they
plant
boughs
in
clay
pots
in
honour
of
the
lover
of
venus
these
boughs
flourish
a
little
time
and
then
what
does
that
signify
nicias
that
it
is
foolish
to
attach
importance
to
that
which
fades
if
beauty
is
but
a
shadow
desire
is
but
a
lightning
flash
what
madness
it
is
then
to
desire
beauty
is
it
not
rational
on
the
contrary
that
that
which
passes
should
go
with
that
which
does
not
endure
and
that
the
lightning
should
devour
the
gliding
shadow
nicias
you
seem
to
me
like
a
child
playing
at
take
my
advice
be
free
by
liberty
only
can
you
become
a
how
can
a
man
be
free
eucrites
when
he
has
a
body
you
shall
see
presently
my
son
presently
you
will
say
eucrites
was
the
old
man
spoke
leaning
against
a
porphyry
pillar
his
face
lighted
by
the
first
rays
of
dawn
hermodorus
and
marcus
had
approached
and
stood
before
him
by
the
side
of
nicias
and
all
four
regardless
of
the
laughter
and
cries
of
the
drinkers
conversed
on
things
divine
eucrites
expresses
himself
so
wisely
and
eloquently
that
marcus
said
you
are
worthy
to
know
the
true
eucrites
replied
the
true
god
is
in
the
heart
of
the
wise
then
they
spoke
of
death
i
wish
said
eucrites
that
it
may
find
me
occupied
in
correcting
my
faults
and
attentive
to
all
my
duties
in
the
face
of
death
i
will
raise
my
pure
hands
to
heaven
and
i
will
say
to
the
gods
your
images
gods
that
you
have
placed
in
the
temple
of
my
soul
i
have
not
profaned
i
have
hung
there
my
thoughts
as
well
as
garlands
fillets
and
wreaths
i
have
lived
according
to
your
providence
i
have
lived
thus
speaking
he
raised
his
arms
to
heaven
and
he
remained
thoughtful
a
moment
then
he
continued
with
extreme
joy
separate
thyself
from
life
eucrites
like
the
ripe
olive
which
falls
returning
thanks
to
the
tree
which
bore
thee
and
blessing
the
earth
thy
at
these
words
drawing
from
the
folds
of
his
robe
a
naked
dagger
he
plunged
it
into
his
breast
those
who
listened
to
him
sprang
forward
to
seize
his
hand
but
the
steel
point
had
already
penetrated
the
heart
of
the
sage
eucrites
had
already
entered
into
his
rest
hermodorus
and
nicias
bore
the
pale
and
bleeding
body
to
one
of
the
couches
amidst
the
shrill
shrieks
of
the
women
the
grunts
of
the
guests
disturbed
in
their
sleep
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
couples
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
the
tapestry
cotta
an
old
soldier
who
slept
lightly
woke
approached
the
corpse
examined
the
wound
and
cried
call
aristaeus
my
physician
nicias
shook
his
head
eucrites
is
no
more
he
said
he
wished
to
die
as
others
wish
to
love
he
has
like
all
of
us
obeyed
his
inexpressible
desire
and
lo
now
he
is
like
unto
the
gods
who
desire
cotta
struck
his
forehead
die
to
want
to
die
when
he
might
still
serve
the
state
what
nonsense
paphnutius
and
thais
remained
motionless
and
mute
side
by
side
their
souls
overflowing
with
disgust
horror
and
hope
suddenly
the
monk
seized
the
hand
of
the
actress
and
stepping
over
the
drunkards
who
had
fallen
close
to
the
lascivious
couples
and
treading
in
the
wine
and
blood
spilt
upon
the
floor
he
led
her
out
of
the
house
the
sun
had
risen
over
the
city
long
colonnades
stretched
on
both
sides
of
the
deserted
street
and
at
the
end
shone
the
dome
of
alexander
s
tomb
here
and
there
on
the
pavement
lay
broken
wreaths
and
extinguished
torches
fresh
wafts
of
the
sea
could
be
felt
in
the
air
paphnutius
with
a
look
of
disgust
tore
off
his
rich
robe
and
trampled
the
fragments
under
his
feet
thou
hast
heard
them
my
thais
he
cried
they
have
spat
forth
every
sort
of
folly
and
abomination
they
dragged
the
divine
creator
of
all
things
down
the
gemonies
of
the
devils
of
hell
impudently
denied
the
existence
of
good
and
evil
blasphemed
jesus
and
exalted
judas
and
the
most
infamous
of
all
the
jackal
of
darkness
the
stinking
beast
the
arian
full
of
corruption
and
death
opened
his
mouth
like
a
yawning
sepulchre
my
thais
thou
hast
seen
these
filthy
snails
crawling
towards
thee
and
defiling
thee
with
their
sticky
sweat
thou
hast
seen
others
like
brutes
sleeping
under
the
heels
of
their
slaves
thou
hast
seen
them
coupling
like
beasts
on
the
carpet
they
had
fouled
with
their
vomit
thou
hast
seen
a
foolish
old
man
shed
a
blood
yet
viler
than
the
wine
which
flowed
at
his
debauch
and
at
the
end
of
the
orgie
throw
himself
in
the
face
of
the
unforeseen
christ
praise
be
to
god
thou
hast
seen
error
and
recognised
how
hideous
it
was
thais
thais
thais
recall
to
mind
the
follies
of
these
philosophers
and
say
if
thou
wilt
go
mad
with
them
remember
the
looks
the
gestures
the
laughs
of
their
fitting
companions
those
two
lascivious
and
malicious
strumpets
and
say
if
thou
wilt
remain
like
unto
steps
on
the
aventine
hill
leading
to
the
tiber
to
which
the
bodies
of
executed
criminals
were
dragged
to
be
thrown
into
the
river
the
word
is
now
obsolete
but
was
employed
by
ben
jonson
sejanus
and
massinger
the
roman
actor
trans
thais
her
heart
stirred
with
horror
and
disgust
at
all
she
had
seen
and
heard
that
night
and
feeling
the
indifference
and
brutality
the
malicious
jealousy
of
women
the
heavy
weight
of
useless
hours
sighed
i
am
weary
to
death
o
my
father
where
shall
i
find
rest
i
feel
that
my
face
is
burning
my
head
empty
and
my
arms
are
so
tired
that
i
should
not
have
the
strength
to
seize
happiness
were
it
within
reach
of
my
paphnutius
gazed
at
her
with
loving
pity
courage
o
my
sister
the
hour
of
rest
rises
for
thee
white
and
pure
as
the
vapours
thou
seest
rise
from
the
gardens
and
they
were
near
the
house
of
thais
and
could
see
above
the
wall
the
tops
of
the
sycamore
and
fir
trees
which
surrounded
the
grotto
of
nymphs
tremble
in
the
morning
breeze
in
front
of
them
was
a
public
square
deserted
and
surrounded
with
steles
and
votive
statues
and
having
at
each
end
a
semicircular
marble
seat
supported
by
figures
of
monsters
thais
fell
on
one
of
these
seats
then
looking
anxiously
at
the
monk
she
asked
what
must
i
do
thou
must
replied
the
monk
follow
him
who
has
come
to
seek
thee
he
will
separate
thee
from
this
present
life
as
the
vintager
gathers
the
cluster
that
would
have
rotted
on
the
tree
and
bears
it
to
the
to
change
it
into
perfumed
wine
listen
there
is
a
dozen
hours
from
alexandria
towards
the
west
not
far
from
the
sea
a
nunnery
the
rules
of
which
a
masterpiece
of
wisdom
deserve
to
be
put
in
lyric
verse
and
sung
to
the
sound
of
the
theorbo
and
tambourines
it
may
truly
be
said
that
the
women
who
are
there
submissive
to
these
rules
have
their
feet
upon
earth
and
their
faces
in
heaven
they
desire
to
be
poor
that
jesus
may
love
them
modest
that
he
may
gaze
upon
them
chaste
that
he
may
wed
them
he
visits
them
every
day
in
the
guise
of
a
gardener
his
feet
bare
his
beautiful
hands
open
even
as
he
showed
himself
to
mary
at
the
entrance
of
the
tomb
i
will
conduct
thee
this
very
day
to
this
nunnery
my
thais
and
soon
commingling
with
these
holy
women
thou
wilt
share
in
their
heavenly
conversation
they
await
thee
as
a
sister
on
the
threshold
of
the
convent
their
mother
the
pious
albina
will
give
thee
the
kiss
of
peace
and
will
say
my
daughter
thou
art
welcome
the
courtesan
uttered
a
cry
of
amazement
albina
a
daughter
of
the
caesars
the
great
niece
of
the
emperor
carus
she
herself
albina
who
born
in
the
purple
has
donned
the
serge
and
a
daughter
of
the
masters
of
this
world
has
risen
to
the
rank
of
servant
of
jesus
christ
she
will
be
thy
thais
rose
and
said
take
me
to
the
house
of
and
paphnutius
completing
his
victory
surely
i
will
conduct
thee
thither
and
there
i
will
place
thee
in
a
cell
where
thou
shalt
weep
for
thy
sins
for
it
is
not
fitting
that
thou
shouldst
mingle
with
the
daughters
of
albina
until
thou
art
cleansed
from
thy
sins
i
will
seal
the
door
and
there
a
happy
prisoner
thou
wilt
wait
in
tears
till
jesus
himself
come
as
a
sign
of
pardon
to
break
the
seal
that
i
have
placed
and
doubt
not
that
he
will
come
thais
and
how
the
flesh
of
thy
soul
will
tremble
when
thou
shalt
feel
the
fingers
of
light
placed
upon
thy
eyes
to
dry
thy
tears
thais
said
a
second
time
take
me
my
father
to
the
house
of
his
heart
filled
with
joy
paphnutius
gazed
around
him
and
tasted
almost
without
fear
the
pleasure
of
contemplating
the
works
of
creation
his
eyes
drank
in
with
joy
god
s
light
and
unknown
breezes
fanned
his
cheeks
suddenly
seeing
at
one
of
the
corners
of
the
public
square
the
little
door
which
led
to
thais
house
and
remembering
that
the
trees
whose
foliage
he
had
been
admiring
shaded
the
courtesan
s
garden
he
thought
of
all
the
impurities
which
there
sullied
the
air
so
light
and
pure
and
his
soul
was
so
grieved
that
bitter
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
thais
he
said
we
must
fly
without
looking
back
but
we
must
not
leave
behind
us
the
instruments
the
witnesses
the
accomplices
of
thy
past
crimes
those
heavy
hangings
those
beds
carpets
perfume
censers
and
lamps
which
would
proclaim
thy
infamy
dost
thou
wish
that
animated
by
the
demons
and
carried
by
the
evil
spirit
that
is
in
them
those
accursed
belongings
should
pursue
thee
even
to
the
desert
it
is
but
too
true
that
there
are
tables
which
bring
ruin
seats
which
serve
as
the
instruments
of
devils
which
act
speak
strike
the
ground
and
pass
through
the
air
let
all
perish
which
has
seen
thy
shame
hasten
thais
and
whilst
the
city
is
yet
asleep
order
thy
slaves
to
make
in
the
centre
of
this
place
a
pile
upon
which
we
will
burn
all
the
abominable
riches
thy
dwelling
thais
consented
do
as
you
will
my
father
she
said
i
know
that
spirits
often
dwell
in
inanimate
objects
at
night
some
articles
of
furniture
talk
either
by
giving
knocks
at
regular
intervals
or
by
emitting
little
flashes
of
light
as
signals
and
even
more
have
you
remarked
my
father
at
the
entrance
to
the
grotto
of
nymphs
on
the
right
a
statue
of
a
naked
woman
about
to
bathe
one
day
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
that
statue
turn
its
head
like
a
living
person
and
then
return
to
its
ordinary
attitude
i
was
terrified
nicias
to
whom
i
related
this
prodigy
laughed
at
me
yet
there
must
be
some
magic
in
that
statue
for
it
inspired
with
violent
desires
a
certain
dalmatian
who
was
insensible
to
my
beauty
it
is
certain
that
i
have
lived
amongst
enchanted
things
and
that
i
was
exposed
to
the
greatest
perils
for
men
have
been
strangled
by
the
embraces
of
a
bronze
statue
yet
it
would
be
a
pity
to
destroy
valuable
works
made
with
rare
skill
and
to
burn
my
carpets
and
tapestry
would
be
a
great
loss
the
beautiful
colours
of
some
of
them
are
truly
wonderful
and
they
cost
much
money
to
those
who
gave
them
to
me
i
also
possess
cups
statues
and
pictures
of
great
price
i
do
not
think
they
ought
to
perish
but
you
know
what
is
necessary
do
as
you
will
my
thus
saying
she
followed
the
monk
to
the
little
door
at
which
so
many
garlands
and
wreaths
had
been
hung
and
when
it
was
opened
she
told
the
porter
to
call
together
all
the
slaves
in
the
house
four
indians
who
were
employed
in
the
kitchen
were
the
first
to
appear
they
were
all
four
yellow
men
and
each
had
but
one
eye
it
had
cost
thais
much
trouble
and
given
her
amusement
to
get
together
these
four
slaves
of
the
same
race
and
all
afflicted
with
the
same
infirmity
when
they
attended
at
table
they
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
guests
and
thais
made
them
relate
the
story
of
their
lives
these
four
waited
in
silence
their
assistants
followed
them
then
came
the
stablemen
the
huntsmen
the
and
the
running
footmen
with
muscles
like
iron
two
gardeners
hirsute
as
priapus
six
ferocious
looking
negroes
three
greek
slaves
one
a
grammarian
another
a
poet
and
the
third
a
singer
they
all
stood
ranged
in
order
on
the
public
square
and
were
presently
joined
by
the
negresses
curious
suspicious
rolling
big
round
eyes
and
each
with
a
huge
mouth
slit
to
her
earrings
lastly
adjusting
their
veils
and
languidly
dragging
their
feet
which
were
shackled
with
light
gold
chains
appeared
six
beautiful
white
when
they
were
all
assembled
thais
pointing
to
paphnutius
said
do
whatever
this
man
commands
you
for
the
spirit
of
god
is
in
him
and
if
you
disobey
him
you
will
fall
for
she
had
heard
and
really
believed
that
the
earth
would
open
and
swallow
up
in
flames
and
smoke
any
impious
wretch
whom
a
saint
of
the
desert
struck
with
his
staff
paphnutius
sent
away
the
women
and
the
greek
and
said
to
the
others
bring
wood
to
the
middle
of
this
place
make
a
huge
fire
and
throw
into
it
all
that
there
is
in
the
house
and
they
were
astonished
and
stood
motionless
looking
at
their
mistress
and
they
still
stood
inactive
and
silent
and
pressed
against
each
other
elbow
to
elbow
suspecting
that
the
order
was
a
joke
obey
said
the
monk
several
of
them
were
christians
they
understood
the
command
and
went
to
the
house
to
fetch
wood
and
torches
the
others
were
not
indisposed
to
imitate
them
for
being
poor
they
hated
riches
and
had
a
natural
instinct
for
destruction
whilst
they
were
building
the
pile
paphnutius
said
to
thais
i
thought
at
one
time
of
fetching
the
treasurer
of
one
of
the
churches
of
alexandria
if
there
still
remain
one
worthy
of
the
name
of
church
and
that
is
not
defiled
by
the
arian
beasts
and
giving
him
thy
goods
woman
that
he
might
distribute
them
to
widows
and
change
the
proceeds
of
crime
into
the
treasure
of
justice
but
such
a
thought
did
not
come
from
god
and
i
cast
it
from
me
for
assuredly
it
would
be
a
great
offence
to
the
of
jesus
christ
to
offer
them
the
spoils
of
thy
lust
thais
all
that
thou
hast
touched
must
be
devoured
by
the
fire
even
to
its
very
soul
thanks
be
to
heaven
these
tunics
and
veils
which
have
seen
kisses
more
innumerable
than
the
waves
of
the
sea
will
only
feel
now
the
lips
and
tongues
of
the
flames
hasten
slaves
more
wood
more
links
and
torches
and
thou
woman
return
to
thy
house
strip
thyself
of
thy
shameful
robes
and
ask
of
the
most
humble
of
thy
slaves
as
an
undeserving
favour
the
tunic
that
she
puts
on
when
she
scrubs
the
thais
obeyed
whilst
the
indians
knelt
down
and
blew
the
embers
the
negroes
threw
on
the
pile
coffers
of
ivory
ebony
or
cedar
which
broke
open
and
let
out
wreaths
garlands
and
necklaces
the
smoke
rose
in
a
dark
column
as
in
the
holocausts
of
the
old
religion
then
the
fire
which
had
been
smouldering
burst
out
suddenly
with
a
roar
as
of
some
monstrous
animal
and
the
almost
invisible
flames
began
to
devour
their
valuable
prey
the
slaves
worked
more
eagerly
they
joyfully
dragged
out
rich
carpets
veils
embroidered
with
silver
and
flowered
tapestry
they
staggered
under
the
weight
of
tables
couches
thick
cushions
and
beds
with
gold
nails
three
strong
ethiopians
came
hugging
the
coloured
statues
of
the
nymphs
one
of
which
had
been
loved
as
though
it
were
a
mortal
and
they
looked
like
huge
apes
carrying
off
women
and
when
the
beautiful
naked
forms
fell
from
the
arms
of
these
monsters
and
were
broken
on
the
stones
a
deep
groan
was
heard
at
that
moment
thais
appeared
her
hair
unloosed
and
streaming
over
her
shoulders
barefooted
and
clad
in
a
clumsy
coarse
garment
which
seemed
redolent
with
divine
voluptuousness
merely
from
having
touched
her
body
behind
her
came
a
gardener
carrying
half
hidden
in
his
long
beard
an
ivory
eros
she
made
a
sign
to
the
man
to
stop
and
approaching
paphnutius
showed
him
the
little
god
my
father
she
asked
should
this
also
be
thrown
into
the
flames
it
is
of
marvellous
antique
work
and
is
worth
a
hundred
times
its
weight
in
gold
its
loss
would
be
irreparable
for
there
is
not
a
sculptor
in
the
world
capable
of
making
such
a
beautiful
eros
remember
also
my
father
that
this
child
is
love
and
he
should
not
be
harshly
treated
believe
me
love
is
a
virtue
and
if
i
have
sinned
it
is
not
through
him
my
father
but
against
him
never
shall
i
regret
aught
that
he
has
caused
me
to
do
and
i
deplore
only
those
things
i
have
done
contrary
to
his
commands
he
does
not
allow
women
to
give
themselves
to
those
who
do
not
come
in
his
name
for
that
reason
he
ought
to
be
honoured
look
paphnutius
how
pretty
this
little
eros
is
with
what
grace
he
hides
himself
in
the
gardener
s
beard
one
day
nicias
who
loved
me
then
brought
it
to
me
and
said
it
will
remind
you
of
but
the
roguish
boy
did
not
remind
me
of
nicias
but
of
a
young
man
i
knew
at
antioch
enough
riches
have
been
destroyed
upon
this
pile
my
father
preserve
this
eros
and
place
it
in
some
monastery
those
who
see
it
will
turn
their
hearts
towards
god
for
love
leads
naturally
to
heavenly
the
gardener
already
believing
that
the
little
eros
was
saved
smiled
on
it
as
though
it
had
been
a
child
when
paphnutius
snatching
the
god
from
the
arms
which
held
it
threw
it
into
the
flames
crying
it
is
enough
that
nicias
has
touched
it
to
make
it
replete
with
every
sort
of
poison
then
seizing
by
armfuls
the
sparkling
robes
the
purple
mantles
the
golden
sandals
the
combs
strigils
mirrors
lamps
theorbos
and
lyres
he
threw
them
into
this
furnace
more
costly
than
the
funeral
pile
of
sardanapalus
whilst
drunken
with
the
rage
of
destruction
the
slaves
danced
round
uttering
wild
yells
amid
a
shower
of
sparks
and
ashes
one
by
one
the
neighbours
awakened
by
the
noise
opened
the
windows
and
rubbing
their
eyes
looked
out
to
see
whence
the
smoke
came
then
they
came
down
half
dressed
and
drew
near
the
fire
what
does
it
mean
they
wondered
amongst
them
were
merchants
from
whom
thais
had
often
bought
perfumes
and
stuffs
and
they
looked
on
anxiously
with
long
yellow
faces
unable
to
comprehend
what
was
going
on
some
young
debauchees
who
returning
from
a
supper
passed
by
there
preceded
by
their
slaves
stopped
their
heads
crowned
with
flowers
their
tunics
floating
and
uttered
loud
cries
attracted
by
curiosity
the
crowd
increased
unceasingly
and
soon
it
was
known
that
thais
had
been
persuaded
by
the
abbot
of
antinoe
to
burn
her
riches
and
retire
to
a
nunnery
the
shopkeepers
thought
to
themselves
thais
is
going
to
leave
the
city
we
shall
sell
no
more
to
her
it
is
dreadful
to
think
of
what
will
become
of
us
without
her
this
monk
has
driven
her
mad
he
is
ruining
us
why
let
him
do
it
what
is
the
use
of
the
laws
are
there
no
magistrates
in
alexandria
thais
does
not
think
about
us
and
our
wives
and
our
poor
children
it
is
a
public
scandal
she
ought
to
be
compelled
to
stay
in
the
the
young
men
on
their
part
also
thought
if
thais
is
going
to
renounce
acting
and
love
our
chief
amusements
will
be
taken
from
us
she
was
the
glory
delight
and
honour
of
the
stage
she
was
the
joy
even
of
those
who
had
never
possessed
her
the
women
we
loved
we
loved
in
her
there
were
no
kisses
given
in
which
she
was
altogether
absent
for
she
was
the
joy
of
all
voluptuaries
and
the
mere
thought
that
she
breathed
amongst
us
excited
us
to
thus
thought
the
young
men
and
one
of
them
named
cerons
who
had
held
her
in
his
arms
cried
out
upon
the
abduction
and
blasphemed
against
christ
in
every
group
the
conduct
of
thais
was
severely
criticised
it
is
a
shameful
flight
a
cowardly
desertion
she
is
taking
the
bread
out
of
our
she
is
robbing
our
she
ought
at
least
to
pay
for
the
wreaths
i
have
sold
to
and
the
sixty
robes
she
has
ordered
of
she
owes
money
to
who
will
represent
iphigenia
electra
and
polyxena
when
she
is
gone
the
handsome
polybia
herself
will
not
make
such
a
success
as
she
has
life
will
be
dull
when
her
door
is
she
was
the
bright
star
the
soft
moon
of
the
alexandrian
all
the
most
notorious
mendicants
of
the
city
cripples
blind
men
and
paralytics
had
by
this
time
assembled
in
the
place
and
crawling
through
the
remnants
of
the
riches
they
groaned
how
shall
we
live
when
thais
is
no
longer
here
to
feed
us
every
day
the
fragments
from
her
table
fed
two
hundred
poor
wretches
and
her
lovers
when
they
quitted
her
threw
us
as
they
passed
handfuls
of
silver
some
thieves
too
also
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
created
a
deafening
clamour
and
pushed
their
neighbours
to
increase
disorder
and
take
advantage
of
the
tumult
to
filch
some
valuable
object
old
taddeus
who
sold
miletan
wool
and
tarentan
linen
and
to
whom
thais
owed
a
large
sum
of
money
alone
remained
calm
and
silent
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
he
listened
and
watched
and
gently
stroking
his
seemed
thoughtful
at
last
he
approached
young
cerons
and
pulling
him
by
the
sleeve
whispered
you
are
the
favoured
lover
of
thais
handsome
youth
show
yourself
and
do
not
allow
this
monk
to
carry
her
by
pollux
and
his
sister
he
shall
not
cried
cerons
i
will
speak
to
thais
and
without
flattering
myself
i
think
she
will
listen
to
me
rather
than
to
that
lapithan
place
place
dogs
and
striking
with
his
fist
the
men
upsetting
the
old
women
and
treading
on
the
young
children
he
reached
thais
and
taking
her
aside
dearest
girl
he
said
look
at
me
remember
and
tell
me
truly
if
you
renounce
but
paphnutius
threw
himself
between
thais
and
cerons
impious
wretch
he
cried
beware
and
touch
her
not
she
is
sacred
she
belongs
to
get
away
baboon
replied
the
young
man
furiously
let
me
speak
to
my
sweetheart
or
if
not
i
will
drag
your
obscene
carcase
by
the
beard
to
the
fire
and
roast
you
like
a
and
he
put
his
hand
on
thais
but
pushed
away
by
the
monk
with
unexpected
force
he
staggered
back
four
paces
and
fell
at
the
foot
of
the
pile
amongst
the
scattered
ashes
old
taddeus
meanwhile
had
been
going
from
one
to
the
other
pulling
the
ears
of
the
slaves
and
kissing
the
hands
of
the
masters
inciting
each
and
all
against
paphnutius
and
had
already
formed
a
little
band
resolutely
determined
to
oppose
the
monk
who
would
steal
thais
from
them
cerons
rose
his
face
black
his
hair
singed
and
choking
with
smoke
and
rage
he
blasphemed
against
the
gods
and
threw
himself
amongst
the
assailants
behind
whom
the
beggars
crawled
shaking
their
crutches
paphnutius
was
soon
enclosed
in
a
circle
of
menacing
fists
raised
sticks
and
cries
of
death
to
the
ravens
with
the
monk
to
the
ravens
no
throw
him
in
the
fire
burn
him
alive
seizing
his
fair
prey
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
impious
men
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
thunder
strive
not
to
tear
the
dove
from
the
eagle
of
the
lord
but
rather
copy
this
woman
and
like
she
turn
your
filth
into
gold
imitate
her
example
and
renounce
the
false
wealth
which
you
think
you
hold
and
which
holds
you
hasten
the
day
is
at
hand
and
divine
patience
begins
to
grow
weary
repent
confess
your
sins
weep
and
pray
walk
in
the
footsteps
of
thais
hate
your
offenses
which
are
as
great
as
hers
which
of
you
poor
or
rich
merchants
soldiers
slaves
or
eminent
citizens
would
dare
to
say
before
god
that
he
was
better
than
a
prostitute
you
are
all
nothing
but
living
filth
and
it
is
by
a
miracle
of
divine
goodness
that
you
do
not
suddenly
turn
into
streams
of
whilst
he
spoke
flames
shot
from
his
eyes
an
it
seemed
as
though
live
coals
came
from
his
lips
and
those
who
surrounded
him
were
obliged
to
hear
him
in
spite
of
themselves
but
old
taddeus
did
not
remain
idle
he
picked
up
stones
and
oyster
shells
which
he
hid
in
the
skirt
of
his
tunic
and
not
daring
to
throw
them
himself
slipped
them
into
the
hands
of
the
beggars
soon
the
stones
began
to
fly
and
a
shell
cut
paphnutius
face
the
blood
which
flowed
down
the
dark
face
of
the
martyr
dropped
in
a
new
baptism
on
the
head
of
the
penitent
and
thais
half
stifled
in
the
monk
s
embrace
and
her
delicate
skin
scratched
by
the
coarse
cassock
felt
a
thrill
of
horror
and
fright
at
that
moment
a
man
elegantly
dressed
and
with
a
wreath
of
wild
celery
on
his
head
opened
a
road
for
himself
through
the
furious
crowd
and
cried
stop
stop
this
monk
is
my
brother
it
was
nicias
who
having
closed
the
eyes
of
the
philosopher
eucrites
was
passing
through
the
square
to
return
to
his
house
and
saw
without
very
much
surprise
for
nothing
astonished
him
the
smoking
pile
thais
clad
an
a
serge
cassock
and
paphnutius
being
stoned
he
repeated
stop
i
tell
you
spare
my
old
respect
the
beloved
head
of
paphnutius
but
being
only
used
to
subtle
disquisitions
with
philosophers
he
did
not
possess
that
imperious
energy
which
commands
vulgar
minds
he
was
not
listened
to
a
shower
of
stones
and
shells
fell
on
the
monk
who
protecting
thais
with
his
body
praised
the
lord
whose
goodness
turned
his
wounds
into
caresses
despairing
of
making
himself
heard
and
feeling
but
too
sure
that
he
could
not
save
his
friend
either
by
force
or
persuasion
nicias
resigned
himself
to
the
will
of
the
gods
in
whom
he
had
little
confidence
when
the
idea
occurred
to
him
to
use
a
stratagem
which
his
contempt
for
men
had
suddenly
suggested
to
him
he
took
from
his
girdle
his
purse
which
was
full
of
gold
and
silver
for
he
was
a
and
charitable
man
and
running
up
to
the
men
who
were
throwing
the
stones
he
chinked
the
money
in
their
ears
at
first
they
paid
no
attention
to
him
their
fury
being
too
great
but
little
by
little
their
looks
turned
towards
the
chinking
gold
and
soon
their
arms
dropped
and
no
longer
menaced
their
victim
seeing
that
he
had
attracted
their
eyes
and
minds
nicias
opened
his
purse
and
threw
some
pieces
of
gold
and
silver
amongst
the
crowd
the
more
greedy
of
them
stooped
to
pick
it
up
the
philosopher
pleased
at
his
first
success
adroitly
threw
deniers
and
drachmas
here
and
there
at
the
sound
of
the
pieces
of
money
rattling
on
the
pavement
the
persecutors
of
paphnutius
threw
themselves
on
the
ground
beggars
slaves
and
tradespeople
scrambled
after
the
money
whilst
grouped
round
cerons
the
patricians
watched
the
struggle
and
laughed
heartily
cerons
himself
quite
forgot
his
wrath
his
friends
encouraged
the
rivals
chose
competitors
and
made
bets
and
urged
on
the
miserable
wretches
as
they
would
have
done
fighting
dogs
a
cripple
without
legs
having
succeeded
in
seizing
a
drachma
the
applause
was
frenetic
the
young
men
themselves
began
to
throw
money
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
in
the
square
but
a
multitude
of
backs
rising
and
falling
like
waves
of
the
sea
under
a
shower
of
coins
paphnutius
was
forgotten
nicias
ran
up
to
him
covered
him
with
his
cloak
and
dragged
him
and
thais
into
where
they
were
safe
from
pursuit
they
ran
for
some
time
in
silence
and
when
they
thought
they
were
out
of
reach
of
their
enemies
they
ceased
running
and
nicias
said
in
a
tone
of
raillery
in
which
a
little
sadness
was
mingled
it
is
finished
then
pluto
ravishes
proserpine
and
thais
will
follow
my
friend
whithersoever
he
will
lead
it
is
true
nicias
replied
thais
that
i
am
tired
of
living
with
men
like
you
smiling
perfumed
kindly
egoists
i
am
weary
of
all
i
know
and
i
am
therefore
going
to
seek
the
unknown
i
have
experienced
joy
that
was
not
joy
and
here
is
a
man
who
teaches
me
that
sorrow
is
true
joy
i
believe
him
for
he
knows
the
and
i
sweetheart
replied
nicias
smiling
i
know
the
truths
he
knows
but
one
i
know
them
all
i
am
superior
to
him
in
that
respect
but
to
tell
the
truth
it
doesn
t
make
me
any
the
prouder
nor
any
the
then
seeing
that
the
monk
was
glaring
fiercely
at
him
my
dear
paphnutius
do
not
imagine
that
i
think
you
extremely
absurd
or
even
altogether
unreasonable
and
if
i
were
to
compare
your
life
with
mine
i
could
not
say
which
is
preferable
in
itself
i
shall
presently
go
and
take
the
bath
which
crobyle
and
myrtale
have
prepared
for
me
i
shall
eat
the
wing
of
a
phasian
pheasant
then
i
shall
read
for
the
hundredth
time
some
fable
by
apuleius
or
some
treatise
by
porphyry
you
will
return
to
your
cell
where
leaning
like
a
tame
camel
you
will
ruminate
on
i
know
not
what
formulas
of
incarnations
you
have
long
chewed
and
rechewed
and
in
the
evening
you
will
swallow
some
radishes
without
any
oil
well
my
dear
friend
in
accomplishing
these
acts
so
different
apparently
we
are
both
obeying
the
same
sentiment
the
only
motive
for
all
human
actions
we
are
both
seeking
our
own
pleasure
and
striving
to
attain
the
same
end
happiness
the
impossible
happiness
it
would
be
folly
on
my
part
to
say
you
were
wrong
dear
friend
even
though
i
think
myself
in
the
right
and
you
my
thais
go
and
enjoy
yourself
and
be
more
happy
still
if
it
be
possible
in
abstinence
and
austerity
than
you
have
been
in
riches
and
pleasure
on
the
whole
i
should
say
you
were
to
be
envied
for
if
in
our
whole
lives
paphnutius
and
i
have
pursued
but
one
kind
of
pleasurable
satisfaction
you
in
your
life
dear
thais
have
tasted
diverse
joys
such
as
it
is
rarely
given
to
the
same
person
to
know
i
should
really
like
to
be
for
one
hour
a
saint
like
our
dear
friend
paphnutius
but
that
is
not
possible
farewell
then
thais
go
where
the
secret
forces
of
nature
and
your
destiny
conduct
you
go
and
take
with
you
whithersoever
you
go
the
good
wishes
of
nicias
i
know
that
is
mere
foolishness
but
can
i
give
you
anything
more
than
barren
regrets
and
vain
wishes
in
payment
for
the
delicious
illusions
which
once
enveloped
me
when
i
was
in
your
arms
and
of
which
only
the
shadow
now
remains
to
me
farewell
my
benefactress
farewell
goodness
that
is
ignorant
of
its
own
existence
mysterious
virtue
joy
of
men
farewell
to
the
most
adorable
of
the
images
that
nature
has
ever
thrown
for
some
unknown
reasons
on
the
face
of
this
deceptive
world
whilst
he
spoke
deep
wrath
had
been
brewing
in
the
monk
s
heart
and
it
now
broke
forth
in
imprecations
avaunt
cursed
wretch
i
scorn
thee
and
hate
thee
go
child
of
hell
a
thousand
times
worse
than
those
poor
lost
ones
who
just
now
threw
stones
and
insults
at
me
they
knew
not
what
they
did
and
the
grace
of
god
which
i
implored
for
them
may
some
day
descend
into
their
hearts
but
thou
detestable
nicias
thou
art
but
a
perfidious
venom
and
a
bitter
poison
thy
mouth
breathes
despair
and
death
one
of
thy
smiles
contains
more
blasphemy
than
issues
in
a
century
from
the
smoking
lips
of
satan
avaunt
backslider
nicias
looked
at
him
farewell
my
brother
he
said
and
may
you
preserve
until
your
life
s
end
your
store
of
faith
hate
and
love
farewell
thais
it
is
in
vain
that
you
will
forget
me
because
i
shall
ever
remember
on
quitting
them
he
walked
thoughtfully
through
the
winding
streets
in
the
vicinity
of
the
great
cemetery
of
alexandria
which
are
peopled
by
the
makers
of
funeral
urns
their
shops
were
full
of
clay
figures
painted
in
bright
colours
and
representing
gods
and
goddesses
mimes
women
winged
sprites
such
as
were
usually
buried
with
the
dead
he
fancied
that
perhaps
some
of
the
little
images
which
he
saw
there
might
be
the
companions
of
his
eternal
sleep
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
little
eros
with
its
tunic
tucked
up
laughed
at
him
mockingly
he
looked
forward
to
his
death
and
the
idea
was
painful
to
him
to
cure
his
sadness
he
tried
to
philosophise
and
reasoned
thus
assuredly
he
said
to
himself
time
has
no
reality
it
is
a
simple
illusion
of
our
minds
then
if
it
does
not
exist
how
can
it
bring
death
to
me
does
that
mean
that
i
shall
live
for
ever
no
but
i
conclude
therefrom
that
my
death
is
always
has
been
as
it
always
will
be
i
do
not
feel
it
yet
but
it
is
in
me
and
i
ought
not
to
fear
it
for
it
would
be
folly
to
dread
the
coming
of
that
which
has
arrived
it
exists
like
the
last
page
of
a
book
i
read
and
have
not
this
argument
occupied
him
all
the
rest
of
the
way
but
without
making
him
more
cheerful
and
his
mind
was
filled
with
dismal
thoughts
when
he
arrived
at
the
door
of
his
house
and
heard
the
merry
laughter
of
crobyle
and
myrtale
who
were
playing
at
tennis
whilst
they
were
waiting
for
him
paphnutius
and
thais
left
the
city
by
the
gate
of
the
moon
and
followed
the
coast
woman
said
the
monk
all
that
great
blue
sea
could
not
wash
away
thy
he
spoke
with
scorn
and
anger
more
filthy
than
a
bitch
or
a
sow
thou
hast
prostituted
to
pagans
and
infidels
a
body
which
the
eternal
had
intended
for
a
tabernacle
and
thy
impurities
are
such
that
now
that
thou
knowest
the
truth
thou
canst
not
unite
thy
lips
or
join
thy
hands
without
a
horror
of
thyself
rising
in
thy
she
followed
him
meekly
over
stony
roads
under
a
burning
sun
her
knees
ached
from
fatigue
and
her
throat
was
parched
with
thirst
but
far
from
feeling
any
of
the
pity
which
softens
the
hearts
of
the
profane
paphnutius
rejoiced
at
these
propitiatory
sufferings
of
the
flesh
which
had
so
sinned
so
infuriated
was
he
with
holy
zeal
that
he
would
have
liked
to
cut
with
rods
the
body
that
had
preserved
its
beauty
as
a
shining
witness
to
its
infamy
his
meditations
augmented
his
pious
fury
and
remembering
that
thais
had
received
nicias
in
her
bed
that
idea
seemed
so
horrible
to
him
that
his
blood
all
flowed
back
to
his
heart
and
his
breast
felt
ready
to
burst
his
curses
were
stifled
in
his
throat
and
he
could
only
grind
his
teeth
he
sprang
forward
and
stood
before
her
pale
terrible
and
filled
with
the
spirit
of
god
looked
into
her
very
soul
and
then
spat
in
her
face
she
calmly
wiped
her
face
and
continued
to
walk
on
he
followed
glaring
at
her
in
pious
anger
as
if
she
had
been
hell
itself
he
was
thinking
how
he
could
avenge
christ
in
order
that
christ
should
not
avenge
himself
when
he
saw
a
drop
of
blood
that
had
dripped
from
the
foot
of
thais
on
the
sand
then
a
hitherto
unknown
influence
entered
his
opened
heart
sobs
rose
to
his
lips
he
wept
he
ran
and
knelt
before
her
called
her
his
sister
and
kissed
her
bleeding
feet
he
murmured
a
hundred
times
my
sister
my
sister
my
mother
o
most
holy
he
prayed
angels
of
heaven
receive
carefully
this
drop
of
blood
and
bear
it
before
the
throne
of
the
lord
and
may
a
miraculous
anemone
blossom
on
the
sand
sprinkled
with
the
blood
of
thais
that
those
who
see
the
flower
may
recover
purity
of
heart
and
feeling
o
holy
holy
most
holy
thais
as
he
prayed
and
prophesied
thus
a
lad
passed
on
an
ass
paphnutius
ordered
him
to
descend
seated
thais
on
the
ass
and
led
it
by
the
bridle
towards
evening
they
came
to
a
canal
shaded
by
fine
trees
he
tied
the
ass
to
the
trunk
of
a
date
palm
and
sitting
on
a
mossy
stone
he
shared
with
thais
a
loaf
which
they
ate
with
salt
and
hyssop
they
drank
fresh
water
in
their
hands
and
talked
of
things
eternal
she
said
i
have
never
drunk
water
so
pure
nor
breathed
an
air
so
light
and
i
feel
that
god
floats
in
the
breezes
that
look
it
is
the
evening
o
my
sister
the
blue
shadows
of
night
cover
the
hills
but
soon
thou
wilt
see
shining
in
the
dawn
the
tabernacles
of
light
soon
thou
wilt
behold
shine
forth
the
roses
of
the
eternal
they
journeyed
all
night
and
while
the
crescent
moon
gleamed
on
the
silver
crests
of
the
waves
they
sang
psalms
and
hymns
when
the
sun
rose
the
libyan
desert
stretched
before
them
like
a
huge
at
the
edge
of
the
desert
and
close
to
a
few
some
white
huts
shimmered
in
the
morning
light
are
those
the
tabernacles
of
light
father
asked
thais
even
so
my
daughter
and
my
sister
yonder
is
the
house
of
salvation
where
i
will
confine
you
with
my
own
soon
they
saw
a
number
of
women
busy
around
the
buildings
like
bees
round
their
hives
there
were
some
who
baked
bread
or
prepared
vegetables
many
were
spinning
wool
and
the
light
of
heaven
shone
upon
them
like
a
smile
of
god
others
meditated
in
the
shade
of
the
tamarisk
trees
their
white
hands
hung
by
their
sides
for
being
filled
with
love
they
had
chosen
the
part
of
magdalen
and
performed
no
work
but
prayer
contemplation
and
ecstasy
they
were
therefore
called
the
marys
and
were
clad
in
white
those
who
worked
with
their
hands
were
called
the
marthas
and
wore
blue
robes
all
wore
the
hood
but
the
younger
ones
allowed
a
few
curls
to
show
on
their
foreheads
unintentionally
it
is
to
be
presumed
since
it
was
forbidden
by
the
rules
a
very
old
lady
tall
and
white
walked
from
cell
to
cell
leaning
on
a
staff
of
hard
wood
paphnutius
approached
her
respectfully
kissed
the
hem
of
her
veil
and
said
the
peace
of
the
lord
be
with
thee
venerable
albina
i
have
brought
to
the
hive
of
which
thou
art
queen
a
bee
i
found
lost
on
a
flowerless
road
i
took
it
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
and
revived
it
with
my
breath
i
give
it
to
and
he
pointed
to
the
actress
who
knelt
down
before
the
daughter
of
the
caesars
albina
cast
a
piercing
glance
on
thais
ordered
her
to
rise
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
then
turning
to
the
monk
we
will
place
her
she
said
amongst
the
paphnutius
then
related
how
thais
had
been
brought
to
the
house
of
salvation
and
asked
that
she
should
be
at
once
confined
in
a
cell
the
abbess
consented
and
led
the
penitent
to
a
hut
which
had
remained
empty
since
the
death
of
the
virgin
laeta
who
had
sanctified
it
in
this
narrow
chamber
there
was
but
a
bed
a
table
and
a
pitcher
and
thais
when
she
crossed
the
threshold
felt
filled
with
ineffable
joy
i
wish
to
close
the
door
myself
said
paphnutius
and
put
thereon
a
seal
which
jesus
will
come
and
break
with
his
own
he
went
to
the
side
of
the
spring
and
took
a
handful
of
wet
clay
mixed
with
it
a
little
spittle
and
a
hair
from
his
head
and
plastered
it
across
the
chink
of
the
door
then
approaching
the
window
near
which
thais
stood
peaceful
and
happy
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
praised
the
lord
three
times
how
beautiful
are
the
feet
of
her
who
walketh
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
how
beautiful
are
her
feet
and
how
resplendent
her
face
he
rose
lowered
his
hood
over
his
eyes
and
walked
away
slowly
albina
called
one
of
her
virgins
my
daughter
she
said
take
to
thais
those
things
which
are
needful
for
her
bread
water
and
a
flute
with
three
part
the
third
the
euphorbia
paphnutius
had
returned
to
the
holy
desert
he
took
near
athribis
the
boat
which
went
up
the
nile
to
carry
food
to
the
monastery
of
abbot
serapion
when
he
disembarked
his
disciples
advanced
to
meet
him
with
great
demonstrations
of
joy
some
raised
their
arms
to
heaven
others
prostrate
on
the
ground
kissed
the
abbot
s
sandals
for
they
knew
already
what
the
saint
had
accomplished
in
alexandria
the
monks
generally
received
by
rapid
and
unknown
means
information
concerning
the
safety
or
glory
of
the
church
news
spread
through
the
desert
with
the
rapidity
of
the
simoon
when
paphnutius
strode
across
the
sand
his
disciples
followed
him
praising
the
lord
flavian
who
was
the
oldest
member
of
the
brotherhood
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
pious
frenzy
and
began
to
sing
an
inspired
hymn
o
blessed
day
now
is
our
father
restored
to
us
he
has
returned
laden
with
fresh
merits
of
which
we
reap
the
benefit
for
the
virtues
of
the
father
are
the
wealth
of
the
children
and
the
sanctity
of
the
abbot
illuminates
every
cell
paphnutius
our
father
has
given
a
new
spouse
to
jesus
christ
by
his
wondrous
art
he
has
changed
a
black
sheep
into
a
white
sheep
and
now
behold
he
has
returned
to
us
laden
with
fresh
merits
like
unto
the
bee
of
the
arsinoetid
heavy
with
the
nectar
of
flowers
even
as
the
ram
of
nubia
which
could
hardly
bear
the
weight
of
its
abundant
wool
let
us
celebrate
this
day
by
mingling
oil
with
our
when
they
came
to
the
door
of
the
abbot
s
cell
they
fell
on
their
knees
and
said
let
our
father
bless
us
and
give
each
of
us
a
measure
of
oil
to
celebrate
his
paul
the
fool
who
alone
had
remained
standing
asked
who
is
this
man
and
did
not
recognise
paphnutius
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
what
he
said
as
he
was
known
to
be
devoid
of
intelligence
though
filled
with
piety
the
abbot
of
antinoe
locked
in
his
cell
thought
i
have
at
last
regained
the
haven
of
my
repose
and
happiness
i
have
returned
to
my
fortress
of
contentment
but
how
is
it
that
this
roof
of
rushes
so
dear
to
me
does
not
receive
me
as
a
friend
and
the
walls
say
not
to
me
thou
art
nothing
has
changed
since
my
departure
in
this
abode
i
have
chosen
there
is
my
table
and
my
bed
there
is
the
mummy
s
head
which
has
so
often
inspired
me
with
salutary
thoughts
and
there
is
the
book
in
which
i
have
so
often
sought
conceptions
of
god
and
yet
nothing
that
i
left
is
here
the
things
appear
grievously
despoiled
of
their
customary
charm
and
it
seems
to
me
as
though
i
saw
them
for
the
first
time
when
i
look
at
that
table
and
couch
that
in
former
days
i
made
with
my
own
hands
that
black
dried
head
these
rolls
of
papyrus
filled
with
the
sayings
of
god
i
seem
to
see
the
belongings
of
a
dead
man
after
having
known
them
all
so
well
i
know
them
no
longer
alas
since
nothing
around
me
has
really
changed
it
is
i
who
am
no
longer
what
i
was
i
am
another
i
am
the
dead
man
what
has
happened
my
god
what
has
been
taken
from
me
what
is
left
unto
me
and
who
am
i
and
it
especially
perplexed
him
to
find
in
spite
of
himself
that
his
cell
was
small
whereas
when
viewed
by
the
eye
of
faith
he
ought
to
consider
it
immense
because
the
infinitude
of
god
began
there
he
began
to
pray
with
his
face
against
the
ground
and
felt
a
little
happier
he
had
hardly
been
an
hour
in
prayer
when
a
vision
of
thais
passed
before
his
eyes
he
returned
thanks
to
god
jesus
it
is
thou
who
hast
sent
her
i
acknowledge
in
that
thy
wonderful
goodness
thou
wouldst
please
me
reassure
me
and
comfort
me
by
the
sight
of
her
whom
i
have
given
to
thee
thou
presentest
her
to
my
eyes
with
her
smile
now
disarmed
her
grace
now
become
innocent
her
beauty
from
which
i
have
extracted
the
sting
to
please
me
my
god
thou
showest
her
to
me
as
i
have
prepared
and
purified
her
for
thy
designs
as
one
friend
pleasantly
reminds
another
of
the
rich
gift
he
has
received
from
him
therefore
i
see
this
woman
with
delight
being
assured
that
the
vision
comes
from
thee
thou
dost
not
forget
that
i
have
given
her
to
thee
jesus
keep
her
since
she
pleases
thee
and
suffer
not
her
beauty
to
give
joy
to
any
but
he
could
not
sleep
all
night
and
he
saw
thais
more
distinctly
than
he
had
seen
her
in
the
grotto
of
nymphs
he
commended
himself
saying
what
i
have
done
i
have
done
to
the
glory
of
yet
to
his
great
surprise
his
heart
was
not
at
ease
he
sighed
why
art
thou
sad
o
my
soul
and
why
dost
thou
trouble
me
and
his
mind
was
still
perturbed
thirty
days
he
remained
in
that
condition
of
sadness
which
precedes
the
sore
trials
of
a
solitary
monk
the
image
of
thais
never
left
him
day
or
night
he
did
not
try
to
banish
it
because
he
still
thought
it
came
from
god
and
was
the
image
of
a
saint
but
one
morning
she
visited
him
in
a
dream
her
hair
crowned
with
violets
and
her
very
gentleness
seemed
so
formidable
that
he
uttered
a
cry
of
fright
and
woke
in
an
icy
sweat
his
eyes
were
still
heavy
with
sleep
when
he
felt
a
moist
warm
breath
on
his
face
a
little
jackal
its
two
paws
placed
on
the
side
of
the
bed
was
panting
its
stinking
breath
in
his
face
and
grinning
at
him
paphnutius
was
greatly
astonished
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
a
tower
had
given
way
under
his
feet
and
in
fact
he
had
fallen
for
his
had
gone
for
some
time
he
was
incapable
of
thought
and
when
he
did
recover
himself
his
meditations
only
increased
his
perplexity
it
is
one
of
two
things
he
said
to
himself
either
this
vision
like
the
preceding
ones
came
from
god
and
was
a
good
vision
and
it
is
my
natural
perversity
which
has
misrepresented
it
as
wine
turns
sour
in
a
dirty
cup
i
have
by
my
unworthiness
changed
instruction
into
reproach
of
which
this
diabolical
jackal
immediately
took
advantage
or
else
this
vision
came
not
from
god
but
on
the
contrary
from
the
devil
and
was
evil
in
that
case
i
should
doubt
whether
the
former
ones
had
as
i
thought
a
celestial
origin
i
am
therefore
incapable
of
that
discernment
which
is
necessary
for
the
ascetic
in
either
case
it
is
plain
that
god
is
no
longer
with
me
of
which
i
feel
the
effects
though
i
can
not
explain
the
he
reasoned
in
this
way
and
anxiously
asked
just
god
what
trials
dost
thou
appoint
for
thy
servants
if
the
apparitions
of
thy
saints
are
a
danger
for
them
give
me
to
discern
by
an
intelligible
sign
that
which
comes
from
thee
and
that
which
comes
from
the
and
as
god
whose
designs
are
inscrutable
did
not
see
fit
to
enlighten
his
servant
paphnutius
lost
in
doubt
resolved
not
to
think
of
thais
any
more
but
his
resolutions
were
vain
though
absent
she
was
ever
with
him
she
gazed
at
him
whilst
he
read
or
meditated
or
prayed
or
met
his
eyes
wherever
he
looked
her
imaginary
approach
was
heralded
by
a
slight
sound
such
as
is
made
by
a
woman
s
dress
when
she
walks
and
the
visions
had
more
verisimilitude
than
reality
itself
which
moves
and
is
confused
whereas
the
phantoms
which
are
caused
by
solitude
are
fixed
and
unchangeable
she
came
under
various
appearances
sometimes
pensive
her
head
crowned
with
her
last
perishable
wreath
clad
as
at
the
banquet
at
alexandria
in
a
mauve
robe
spangled
with
silver
flowers
sometimes
voluptuously
in
a
cloud
of
light
veils
and
bathed
in
the
warm
shadows
of
the
grotto
of
nymphs
sometimes
in
a
serge
cassock
pious
and
radiant
with
celestial
joy
sometimes
tragic
her
eyes
swimming
in
the
terrors
of
death
and
showing
her
bare
breast
bedewed
with
the
blood
from
her
pierced
heart
what
disturbed
him
the
most
in
these
visions
was
that
the
wreaths
tunics
and
veils
that
he
had
burned
with
his
own
hands
should
thus
return
it
became
evident
to
him
that
these
things
had
an
imperishable
soul
and
he
cried
lo
all
the
countless
souls
of
the
sins
of
thais
come
upon
me
when
he
turned
away
his
head
he
felt
that
thais
was
behind
him
and
that
made
him
feel
still
more
uneasy
his
torture
was
cruel
but
as
his
soul
and
body
remained
pure
in
the
midst
of
all
his
temptations
he
trusted
in
god
and
gently
complained
to
him
my
god
if
i
went
so
far
to
seek
her
amongst
the
gentiles
it
was
for
thy
sake
and
not
for
mine
it
would
not
be
just
that
i
should
suffer
for
what
i
have
done
in
thy
behalf
protect
me
sweet
jesus
my
saviour
save
me
suffer
not
the
phantom
to
accomplish
that
which
the
body
could
not
as
i
have
triumphed
over
the
flesh
suffer
not
the
shadow
to
overthrow
me
i
know
that
i
am
now
exposed
to
greater
dangers
than
i
ever
ran
i
feel
and
know
that
the
dream
has
more
power
than
the
reality
and
how
could
it
be
otherwise
since
it
is
itself
but
a
higher
reality
it
is
the
soul
of
things
plato
though
he
was
but
an
idolater
has
testified
to
the
real
existence
of
ideas
at
that
banquet
of
demons
to
which
thou
accompaniedst
me
lord
i
heard
men
sullied
with
crimes
truly
but
certainly
not
devoid
of
intelligence
agree
to
acknowledge
that
we
see
real
objects
in
solitude
meditation
and
ecstasy
and
thy
scriptures
my
god
many
times
affirm
the
virtue
of
dreams
and
the
power
of
visions
formed
either
by
thee
great
god
or
by
thy
there
was
a
new
man
in
him
and
now
he
reasoned
with
god
but
god
did
not
choose
to
enlighten
him
his
nights
were
one
long
dream
and
his
days
did
not
differ
from
his
nights
one
morning
he
awoke
uttering
sighs
such
as
issue
by
moonlight
from
the
tombs
of
the
victims
of
crimes
thais
had
come
showing
her
bleeding
feet
and
whilst
he
wept
she
had
slipped
into
his
couch
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
the
image
of
thais
was
an
impure
image
his
heart
filled
with
disgust
he
leaped
out
of
his
profaned
couch
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
that
he
might
not
see
the
daylight
the
hours
passed
but
they
did
not
remove
his
shame
all
was
quiet
in
the
cell
for
the
first
time
for
many
long
days
paphnutius
was
alone
the
phantom
had
at
last
left
him
and
even
its
absence
seemed
dreadful
nothing
nothing
to
distract
his
mind
from
the
recollection
of
the
dream
full
of
horror
he
thought
why
did
i
not
drive
her
away
why
did
i
not
tear
myself
from
her
cold
arms
and
burning
knees
he
no
longer
dared
to
pronounce
the
name
of
god
near
that
horrible
couch
and
he
feared
that
his
cell
being
profaned
the
demons
might
freely
enter
at
any
hour
his
fears
did
not
deceive
him
the
seven
little
jackals
which
had
never
crossed
the
threshold
entered
in
a
file
and
went
and
hid
under
the
bed
at
the
vesper
hour
there
came
an
eighth
the
stench
of
which
was
horrible
the
next
day
a
ninth
joined
the
others
and
soon
there
were
thirty
then
sixty
then
eighty
they
became
smaller
as
they
multiplied
and
being
no
bigger
than
rats
they
covered
the
floor
the
couch
and
the
stool
one
of
them
jumped
on
the
little
table
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
standing
with
its
four
feet
together
on
the
death
s
head
looked
at
the
monk
with
burning
eyes
and
every
day
fresh
jackals
came
to
expiate
the
abominable
sin
of
his
dream
and
flee
from
impure
thoughts
paphnutius
determined
to
leave
his
cell
which
had
now
become
polluted
go
far
into
the
desert
and
practise
austerities
strange
labours
and
fresh
works
of
grace
but
before
putting
his
design
into
action
he
went
to
see
old
palemon
and
ask
his
advice
he
found
him
in
his
garden
watering
his
lettuces
it
was
the
evening
the
blue
nile
flowed
at
the
foot
of
violet
hills
the
good
old
man
was
walking
slowly
in
order
not
to
frighten
a
pigeon
that
had
perched
on
his
shoulder
the
lord
be
with
thee
brother
paphnutius
he
said
admire
his
goodness
he
sends
me
the
animals
that
he
has
created
that
i
may
converse
with
them
of
his
works
and
praise
him
in
the
birds
of
the
air
look
at
this
pigeon
note
the
changing
hues
of
its
neck
and
say
is
it
not
a
beautiful
work
of
god
but
have
you
not
come
to
talk
with
me
brother
on
some
pious
subject
if
so
i
will
put
down
my
and
listen
to
paphnutius
told
the
old
man
about
his
journey
his
return
the
visions
of
his
days
and
the
dreams
of
his
nights
without
omitting
the
sinful
one
and
the
pack
of
jackals
do
you
not
think
father
he
added
that
i
ought
to
bury
myself
in
the
desert
and
perform
some
extraordinary
austerities
that
would
even
astonish
the
devil
i
am
but
a
poor
sinner
replied
palemon
and
i
know
little
about
men
having
passed
all
my
life
in
this
garden
with
gazelles
little
hares
and
pigeons
but
it
seems
to
me
brother
that
your
distemper
comes
from
your
having
passed
too
suddenly
from
the
noisy
world
to
the
calm
of
solitude
such
sudden
transitions
can
but
do
harm
to
the
health
of
the
soul
you
are
brother
like
a
man
who
exposes
himself
almost
at
the
same
time
to
great
heat
and
great
cold
a
cough
shakes
him
and
fever
torments
him
in
your
place
brother
paphnutius
instead
of
retiring
at
once
into
some
awful
desert
i
should
take
such
amusements
as
are
fitting
to
a
monk
and
a
holy
abbot
i
should
visit
the
monasteries
in
the
neighbourhood
some
of
them
are
wonderful
it
is
said
that
of
abbot
serapion
contains
i
have
been
told
a
thousand
four
hundred
and
cells
and
the
monks
are
divided
into
as
many
legions
as
there
are
letters
in
the
greek
alphabet
i
am
even
informed
that
a
certain
analogy
is
observed
between
the
character
of
the
monks
and
the
shape
of
the
letter
by
which
they
are
designated
and
that
for
example
those
who
are
placed
under
z
have
a
tortuous
character
whilst
those
under
i
have
an
upright
mind
if
i
were
you
brother
i
should
go
and
assure
myself
of
this
with
my
own
eyes
and
i
should
know
no
rest
until
i
had
seen
such
a
wonderful
thing
i
should
not
fail
to
study
the
regulations
of
the
various
communities
which
are
scattered
along
the
banks
of
the
nile
so
as
to
be
able
to
compare
one
with
another
such
study
is
befitting
a
religious
man
like
yourself
you
have
heard
say
no
doubt
that
abbot
ephrem
has
drawn
up
for
his
monastery
pious
regulations
of
great
beauty
with
his
permission
you
might
make
a
copy
of
them
as
you
are
a
skilful
penman
i
could
not
do
so
for
my
hands
accustomed
to
wield
the
spade
are
too
awkward
to
direct
the
thin
reed
of
the
scribe
over
the
papyrus
but
you
have
the
knowledge
of
letters
brother
and
should
thank
god
for
it
for
beautiful
writing
can
not
be
too
much
admired
the
work
of
the
copyist
and
the
reader
is
a
great
safeguard
against
evil
thoughts
brother
paphnutius
why
do
you
not
write
out
the
teachings
of
our
fathers
paul
and
anthony
little
by
little
you
would
recover
in
these
pious
works
peace
of
soul
and
mind
solitude
would
again
become
pleasant
to
your
heart
and
soon
you
would
be
in
a
condition
to
recommence
those
ascetic
works
which
your
journey
has
interrupted
but
you
must
not
expect
much
benefit
from
excessive
penitence
when
he
was
amongst
us
our
father
anthony
used
to
say
excessive
fasting
produces
weakness
and
weakness
begets
idleness
there
are
some
monks
who
ruin
their
body
by
fasts
improperly
prolonged
of
them
it
may
be
said
that
they
plunge
a
dagger
into
their
own
breast
and
deliver
themselves
up
unresistingly
into
the
power
of
the
so
said
the
holy
man
anthony
i
am
but
a
foolish
old
man
but
by
the
grace
of
god
i
have
remembered
what
our
father
told
paphnutius
thanked
palemon
and
promised
to
think
over
his
advice
when
he
had
passed
the
fence
of
reeds
which
enclosed
the
little
garden
he
turned
round
and
saw
the
good
old
gardener
engaged
in
watering
his
salads
whilst
the
pigeon
walked
about
on
his
bent
back
and
at
that
sight
paphnutius
felt
ready
to
weep
on
returning
to
his
cell
he
found
there
a
strange
turmoil
as
though
it
were
filled
with
grains
of
sand
blown
about
by
a
strong
wind
and
on
looking
closer
he
saw
these
moving
bodies
were
myriads
of
little
jackals
that
night
he
saw
in
a
dream
a
high
stone
column
surmounted
by
a
human
face
and
he
heard
a
voice
which
said
ascend
this
pillar
on
awaking
he
felt
confident
that
this
dream
had
been
sent
from
heaven
he
called
his
disciples
and
addressed
them
in
these
words
my
beloved
sons
i
must
leave
you
and
go
where
god
sends
me
during
my
absence
obey
flavian
as
you
would
me
and
take
care
of
our
brother
paul
bless
you
as
he
strode
away
they
remained
prostrate
on
the
ground
and
when
they
raised
their
heads
they
saw
his
tall
dark
figure
on
the
sandy
horizon
he
walked
day
and
night
until
he
reached
the
ruins
of
the
temple
formerly
built
by
the
idolaters
in
which
he
had
slept
amongst
the
scorpions
and
sirens
on
his
former
strange
journey
the
walls
covered
with
magic
signs
were
still
standing
thirty
immense
columns
which
terminated
in
human
heads
or
lotus
flowers
still
supported
a
heavy
stone
entablature
but
at
one
end
of
the
temple
a
pillar
had
shaken
off
its
old
burden
and
stood
isolated
it
had
for
its
capital
the
head
of
a
woman
which
smiled
with
long
eyes
and
rounded
cheeks
and
on
her
forehead
cow
s
horns
paphnutius
on
seeing
it
recognised
the
column
which
had
been
shown
him
in
his
dream
and
he
calculated
that
it
was
cubits
high
he
went
to
the
neighbouring
village
and
ordered
a
ladder
of
that
height
to
be
made
and
when
the
ladder
was
placed
against
the
pillar
he
ascended
knelt
down
on
the
top
and
said
to
the
lord
here
then
o
god
is
the
abode
thou
hast
chosen
for
me
may
i
remain
here
in
thy
grace
until
the
hour
of
my
he
had
brought
no
provisions
with
him
trusting
in
divine
providence
and
expecting
that
charitable
peasants
would
give
him
all
that
he
needed
and
in
fact
the
next
day
about
the
ninth
hour
women
came
with
their
children
bringing
bread
dates
and
fresh
water
which
the
boys
carried
to
the
top
of
the
column
the
top
of
the
pillar
was
not
large
enough
to
allow
the
monk
to
lie
at
full
length
so
that
he
slept
with
his
legs
crossed
and
his
head
on
his
breast
and
sleep
was
a
more
cruel
torture
to
him
than
his
wakeful
hours
at
dawn
the
ospreys
brushed
him
with
their
wings
and
he
awoke
filled
with
pain
and
terror
it
happened
that
the
carpenter
who
had
made
the
ladder
feared
god
disturbed
at
the
thought
that
the
saint
was
exposed
to
the
sun
and
rain
and
fearing
that
he
might
fall
in
his
sleep
this
pious
man
constructed
a
roof
and
a
railing
on
the
top
of
the
column
soon
the
report
of
this
extraordinary
existence
spread
from
village
to
village
and
the
labourers
of
the
valley
came
on
sundays
with
their
wives
and
children
to
look
at
the
stylite
the
disciples
of
paphnutius
having
learned
with
surprise
the
place
of
this
wonderful
retreat
came
to
him
and
obtained
from
him
permission
to
build
their
huts
at
the
foot
of
the
column
every
morning
they
came
and
stood
in
a
circle
round
the
master
and
received
from
him
the
words
of
instruction
my
sons
he
said
to
them
continue
like
those
little
children
whom
jesus
loved
that
is
the
way
of
salvation
the
sin
of
the
flesh
is
the
source
and
origin
of
all
sins
they
spring
from
it
as
from
a
parent
pride
avarice
idleness
anger
and
envy
are
its
dearly
beloved
progeny
i
have
seen
this
in
alexandria
i
have
seen
rich
men
carried
away
by
the
vice
of
lust
which
like
a
river
with
a
turbid
flood
swept
them
into
the
gulf
of
the
abbots
ephrem
and
serapion
being
informed
of
his
strange
proceeding
wished
to
behold
him
with
their
own
eyes
seeing
from
afar
on
the
river
the
triangular
sail
which
was
bringing
them
to
him
paphnutius
could
not
prevent
himself
from
thinking
that
god
had
made
him
an
example
to
all
solitary
monks
the
two
abbots
when
they
saw
him
did
not
conceal
their
surprise
and
having
consulted
together
they
agreed
in
condemning
such
an
extraordinary
penance
and
exhorted
paphnutius
to
come
down
such
a
mode
of
life
is
contrary
to
all
usage
they
said
it
is
peculiar
and
against
all
but
paphnutius
replied
what
is
the
monastic
life
if
not
peculiar
and
ought
not
the
deeds
of
a
monk
to
be
as
eccentric
as
he
is
himself
it
was
a
sign
from
god
that
caused
me
to
ascend
here
it
is
a
sign
from
god
that
will
make
me
every
day
religious
men
came
to
join
the
disciples
of
paphnutius
and
they
built
for
themselves
shelters
round
the
aerial
hermitage
several
of
them
to
imitate
the
saint
mounted
the
ruins
of
the
temple
but
being
reproved
by
their
brethren
and
conquered
by
fatigue
they
soon
gave
up
these
attempts
pilgrims
flocked
from
all
parts
there
were
some
who
had
come
long
distances
and
were
hungry
and
thirsty
the
idea
occurred
to
a
poor
widow
of
selling
fresh
water
and
melons
against
the
foot
of
the
column
behind
her
bottles
of
red
clay
her
cups
and
her
fruit
under
an
awning
of
striped
canvas
she
cried
who
wants
to
drink
following
the
example
of
this
widow
a
baker
brought
some
bricks
and
made
an
oven
close
by
in
the
hope
of
selling
loaves
and
cakes
to
visitors
as
the
crowd
of
visitors
increased
unceasingly
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
large
cities
of
egypt
began
to
come
some
man
greedy
of
gain
built
a
caravanserai
to
lodge
the
guests
and
their
servants
camels
and
mules
soon
there
was
in
front
of
the
column
a
market
to
which
the
fishermen
of
the
nile
brought
their
fish
and
the
gardeners
their
vegetables
a
barber
who
shaved
people
in
the
open
air
amused
the
crowd
with
his
jokes
the
old
temple
so
long
given
over
to
silence
and
solitude
was
filled
with
countless
sights
and
sounds
of
life
the
innkeepers
turned
the
subterranean
vaults
into
cellars
and
nailed
on
the
old
pillars
signs
surmounted
by
the
figure
of
the
holy
paphnutius
and
bearing
this
inscription
in
greek
and
egyptian
wine
fig
wine
and
genuine
cilician
beer
sold
on
the
walls
sculptured
with
pure
and
graceful
carvings
the
hung
ropes
of
onions
and
smoked
fish
dead
hares
and
the
carcases
of
sheep
in
the
evening
the
old
occupants
of
the
ruins
the
rats
scuttled
in
a
long
row
to
the
river
whilst
the
ibises
suspiciously
craning
their
necks
perched
on
the
high
cornices
to
which
rose
the
smoke
of
the
kitchens
the
shouts
of
the
drinkers
and
the
cries
of
the
tapsters
all
around
builders
laid
out
streets
and
masons
constructed
convents
chapels
and
churches
by
the
end
of
six
months
a
city
was
established
with
a
guardhouse
a
tribunal
a
prison
and
a
school
kept
by
an
old
blind
scribe
the
pilgrims
were
innumerable
bishops
and
other
church
dignitaries
came
full
of
admiration
the
patriarch
of
antioch
who
chanced
to
be
in
egypt
at
that
time
came
with
all
his
clergy
he
highly
approved
of
the
extraordinary
conduct
of
the
stylite
and
the
heads
of
the
libyan
church
followed
in
the
absence
of
athanasius
the
opinion
of
the
patriarch
having
learned
which
abbots
ephrem
and
serapion
came
to
the
feet
of
paphnutius
to
apologise
for
their
former
mistrust
paphnutius
replied
know
my
brothers
that
the
penance
i
endure
is
barely
equal
to
the
temptations
which
are
sent
me
the
number
and
force
of
which
astound
me
a
man
viewed
externally
is
but
small
and
from
the
height
of
the
pillar
to
which
god
has
called
me
i
see
human
beings
moving
about
like
ants
but
considered
internally
man
is
immense
he
is
as
large
as
the
world
for
he
contains
it
all
that
is
spread
before
me
these
monasteries
these
inns
the
boats
on
the
river
the
villages
and
what
i
see
in
the
distance
of
fields
canals
sand
and
mountains
is
nothing
in
respect
to
what
is
in
me
i
carry
in
my
heart
countless
cities
and
illimitable
deserts
and
evil
evil
and
death
spread
over
this
immensity
cover
them
all
as
night
covers
the
earth
i
am
in
myself
alone
a
universe
of
evil
he
spoke
thus
because
the
desire
for
woman
was
in
him
the
seventh
month
there
came
from
alexandria
bubastis
and
sais
women
who
had
long
been
barren
hoping
to
obtain
children
by
the
intercession
of
the
holy
man
and
the
virtues
of
his
pillar
they
rubbed
their
sterile
bodies
against
the
stone
there
followed
a
procession
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
of
chariots
palanquins
and
litters
which
stopped
and
pushed
and
jostled
below
the
man
of
god
from
them
came
sick
people
terrible
to
see
mothers
brought
to
paphnutius
young
boys
whose
limbs
were
twisted
their
eyes
starting
their
mouth
foaming
their
voices
hoarse
he
laid
his
hands
upon
them
blind
men
approached
groping
with
their
hands
and
raising
towards
him
a
face
pierced
with
two
bleeding
holes
paralytics
displayed
before
him
the
heavy
immobility
the
deadly
emaciation
and
the
hideous
contractions
of
their
limbs
lame
men
showed
him
their
club
feet
women
with
cancer
holding
their
bosoms
with
both
hands
uncovered
before
him
their
breasts
devoured
by
the
invisible
vulture
dropsical
women
swollen
like
wine
skins
were
placed
on
the
ground
before
him
he
blessed
them
nubians
afflicted
with
elephantiasis
advanced
with
heavy
steps
and
looked
at
him
with
streaming
eyes
and
expressionless
countenances
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
them
a
young
girl
of
aphroditopolis
was
brought
to
him
on
a
litter
after
having
vomited
blood
she
had
slept
for
three
days
she
looked
like
a
waxen
image
and
her
parents
who
thought
she
was
dead
had
placed
a
palm
leaf
on
her
breast
paphnutius
having
prayed
to
god
the
young
girl
raised
her
head
and
opened
her
eyes
as
the
people
reported
everywhere
the
miracles
which
the
saint
had
performed
unfortunate
persons
afflicted
with
that
disease
which
the
greeks
call
the
divine
malady
came
from
all
parts
of
egypt
in
incalculable
legions
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
pillar
they
were
seized
with
convulsions
rolled
on
the
ground
writhed
and
twisted
themselves
into
a
ball
and
though
it
is
hardly
to
be
believed
the
persons
present
were
in
their
turn
seized
with
a
violent
delirium
and
imitated
the
contortions
of
the
epileptics
monks
and
pilgrims
men
and
women
wallowed
and
struggled
their
limbs
twisted
foaming
at
the
mouth
eating
handfuls
of
earth
and
prophesying
and
paphnutius
at
the
top
of
his
pillar
felt
a
thrill
of
horror
pass
through
him
and
cried
to
god
i
am
the
scapegoat
and
i
take
upon
me
all
the
impurities
of
these
people
and
that
is
why
lord
my
body
is
filled
with
evil
every
time
that
a
sick
person
went
away
healed
the
people
applauded
carried
him
in
triumph
and
ceased
not
to
repeat
we
behold
another
well
of
siloam
hundreds
of
crutches
already
hung
round
the
wonderful
column
grateful
women
suspended
wreaths
and
votive
images
there
some
of
the
greeks
inscribed
distiches
and
as
every
pilgrim
carved
his
name
the
stone
was
soon
covered
as
high
as
a
man
could
reach
with
an
infinity
of
latin
greek
coptic
punic
hebrew
syrian
and
magic
characters
when
the
feast
of
easter
came
there
was
such
an
affluence
of
people
to
this
city
of
miracles
that
old
men
thought
that
the
days
of
the
ancient
mysteries
had
returned
all
sorts
of
people
in
all
sorts
of
costumes
were
to
be
seen
there
the
striped
robes
of
the
egyptians
the
burnoose
of
the
arabs
the
white
drawers
of
the
nubians
the
short
cloak
of
the
greeks
the
long
toga
of
the
romans
the
scarlet
breeches
of
the
barbarians
the
robes
of
the
courtesans
a
veiled
woman
would
pass
on
an
ass
preceded
by
black
eunuchs
who
cleared
a
passage
for
her
by
the
free
use
of
their
sticks
acrobats
having
spread
a
carpet
on
the
ground
juggled
and
performed
skilful
tricks
before
a
circle
of
silent
spectators
unrolled
their
living
girdles
a
glittering
dusty
noisy
chattering
crowd
the
curses
of
the
beating
the
animals
the
cries
of
the
hawkers
who
sold
amulets
against
leprosy
and
the
evil
eye
the
psalmody
of
the
monks
reciting
verses
of
the
bible
the
shrieking
of
the
women
who
were
prophesying
the
shouting
of
the
beggars
singing
old
songs
of
the
harem
the
bleating
of
sheep
the
braying
of
asses
the
sailors
calling
tardy
passengers
all
these
confused
noises
caused
a
deafening
uproar
over
which
dominated
the
strident
voices
of
the
little
naked
negro
boys
running
about
everywhere
selling
fresh
dates
and
all
these
human
beings
stifled
under
the
white
sky
in
a
heavy
atmosphere
laden
with
the
perfumes
of
women
the
odour
of
negroes
the
fumes
of
cooking
and
the
smoke
of
gums
which
the
devotees
bought
of
the
shepherds
to
burn
before
the
saint
when
night
came
fires
torches
and
lanterns
were
lighted
everywhere
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
red
shadows
and
black
shapes
standing
amidst
a
circle
of
squatting
listeners
an
old
man
his
face
lighted
by
a
smoky
lamp
related
how
formerly
bitiou
had
enchanted
his
heart
torn
it
from
his
breast
placed
it
in
an
acacia
and
then
transformed
himself
into
a
tree
he
made
gestures
which
his
shadow
repeated
with
absurd
exaggerations
and
the
audience
uttered
cries
of
admiration
in
the
taverns
the
drinkers
lying
on
couches
called
for
beer
and
wine
dancing
girls
with
painted
eyes
and
bare
stomachs
performed
before
them
religious
or
lascivious
scenes
in
retired
corners
young
men
played
dice
or
other
games
and
old
men
followed
prostitutes
above
all
these
rose
the
solitary
unchanging
column
the
head
with
the
cow
s
horns
gazed
into
the
shadow
and
above
it
paphnutius
watched
between
heaven
and
earth
all
at
once
the
moon
rose
over
the
nile
like
the
bare
shoulder
of
a
goddess
the
hills
gleamed
with
blue
light
and
paphnutius
thought
he
saw
the
body
of
thais
shinning
in
the
glimmer
of
the
waters
amidst
the
sapphire
night
the
days
passed
and
the
saint
still
lived
on
his
pillar
when
the
rainy
season
came
the
waters
of
heaven
filtering
through
the
cracks
in
the
roof
wetted
his
body
his
stiff
limbs
were
incapable
of
movement
scorched
by
the
sun
and
reddened
by
the
dew
his
skin
broke
large
ulcers
devoured
his
arms
and
legs
but
the
desire
of
thais
still
consumed
him
inwardly
and
he
cried
it
is
not
enough
great
god
more
temptations
more
unclean
thoughts
more
horrible
desires
lord
lay
upon
me
all
the
lusts
of
men
that
i
may
expiate
them
all
though
it
is
false
that
the
greek
bitch
took
upon
herself
all
the
sins
of
the
world
as
i
heard
an
impostor
once
declare
yet
there
is
a
hidden
meaning
in
the
fable
the
truth
of
which
i
now
recognise
for
it
is
true
that
the
sins
of
the
people
enter
the
soul
of
the
saints
and
are
lost
there
as
in
a
well
thus
it
is
that
the
souls
of
the
just
are
polluted
with
more
filth
than
is
ever
found
in
the
soul
of
the
sinner
and
for
that
reason
i
praise
thee
o
my
god
for
having
made
me
the
cesspool
of
the
one
day
a
rumour
ran
through
the
holy
city
and
even
reached
the
ears
of
the
hermit
a
very
great
personage
a
man
occupying
a
high
position
the
prefect
of
the
alexandrian
fleet
lucius
aurelius
cotta
was
about
to
visit
the
city
was
indeed
now
on
his
way
the
news
was
true
old
cotta
who
was
inspecting
the
canals
and
the
navigation
of
the
nile
had
many
times
expressed
a
desire
to
see
the
stylite
and
the
new
city
to
which
the
name
of
stylopolis
had
been
given
the
stylopolitans
saw
the
river
covered
with
sails
one
morning
cotta
appeared
on
board
a
golden
galley
hung
with
purple
and
followed
by
all
his
fleet
he
landed
and
advanced
accompanied
by
a
secretary
carrying
his
tablets
and
aristaeus
his
physician
with
whom
he
liked
to
converse
a
numerous
suite
walked
behind
him
and
the
shore
was
covered
with
and
military
uniforms
he
stopped
some
paces
from
the
column
and
began
to
examine
the
stylite
wiping
his
face
meanwhile
with
the
skirt
of
his
toga
being
of
a
naturally
curious
disposition
he
had
observed
many
things
in
the
course
of
his
long
voyages
he
liked
to
remember
them
and
intended
to
write
after
he
had
finished
his
punic
history
a
book
on
the
remarkable
things
he
had
witnessed
he
seemed
much
interested
by
the
spectacle
before
him
the
was
a
toga
with
a
broad
purple
band
worn
by
roman
senators
as
the
distinguishing
mark
of
their
high
office
this
is
very
curious
he
said
puffing
and
blowing
and
which
is
a
circumstance
worthy
of
being
recorded
this
man
was
my
guest
yes
this
monk
supped
with
me
last
year
after
which
he
carried
off
an
turning
to
his
secretary
note
that
my
son
on
my
tablets
also
the
dimensions
of
the
column
not
omitting
the
shape
of
the
top
of
then
wiping
his
face
again
persons
deserving
of
belief
have
assured
me
that
this
monk
has
not
left
his
column
for
a
single
moment
since
he
mounted
it
a
year
ago
is
that
possible
aristaeus
that
which
is
possible
to
a
lunatic
or
a
sick
man
replied
aristaeus
would
be
impossible
to
a
man
sound
in
body
and
mind
do
you
know
lucius
that
sometimes
diseases
of
the
mind
or
body
give
to
those
afflicted
by
them
a
strength
which
healthy
men
do
not
possess
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
no
such
thing
as
good
health
or
bad
health
there
are
only
different
conditions
of
the
organs
having
studied
what
are
called
maladies
i
have
come
to
consider
them
as
necessary
forms
of
life
i
take
pleasure
in
studying
them
in
order
to
be
able
to
conquer
them
some
of
them
are
worthy
of
admiration
and
conceal
under
apparent
disorder
profound
harmonies
for
instance
a
quartan
fever
is
certainly
a
very
pretty
thing
sometimes
certain
affections
of
the
body
cause
a
rapid
augmentation
of
the
faculties
of
the
mind
you
know
creon
when
he
was
a
child
he
stuttered
and
was
stupid
but
having
cracked
his
skull
by
tumbling
off
a
ladder
he
became
an
able
lawyer
as
you
are
aware
this
monk
must
be
affected
in
some
hidden
organ
moreover
this
kind
of
existence
is
not
so
extraordinary
as
it
appears
to
you
lucius
i
may
remind
you
that
the
gymnosophists
of
india
can
remain
motionless
not
merely
for
a
year
but
during
twenty
thirty
or
forty
by
jupiter
cried
cotta
that
is
a
strange
madness
for
man
was
born
to
move
and
act
and
idleness
is
an
unpardonable
crime
because
it
is
an
injury
to
the
state
i
do
not
know
of
any
religion
in
which
such
an
objectionable
practice
is
permitted
though
it
possibly
may
be
in
some
of
the
asiatic
creeds
when
i
was
governor
of
syria
i
found
erected
in
the
porches
at
the
city
of
hera
a
man
ascended
twice
a
year
and
remained
there
for
a
week
the
people
believed
that
this
man
talked
with
the
gods
and
interceded
with
them
for
the
prosperity
of
syria
the
custom
appeared
senseless
to
me
nevertheless
i
did
nothing
to
put
it
down
for
i
consider
that
a
functionary
ought
not
to
interfere
with
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
people
but
on
the
contrary
to
see
that
they
are
preserved
it
is
not
the
business
of
the
government
to
force
a
religion
on
a
people
but
to
maintain
that
which
exists
which
whether
good
or
bad
has
been
regulated
by
the
spirit
of
the
time
the
place
and
the
race
if
it
endeavours
to
put
down
a
religion
it
proclaims
itself
revolutionary
in
its
spirit
and
tyrannical
in
its
acts
and
is
justly
detested
besides
how
are
you
to
raise
yourself
above
the
superstitions
of
the
vulgar
except
by
understanding
them
and
tolerating
them
aristaeus
i
am
of
opinion
that
i
should
leave
this
in
the
air
exposed
only
to
the
indignities
the
birds
shower
on
him
i
should
not
gain
anything
by
having
him
pulled
down
but
i
should
by
taking
note
of
his
thoughts
and
the
built
by
the
cuckoos
in
the
of
aristophanes
he
puffed
coughed
and
placed
his
hand
on
the
secretary
s
shoulder
my
child
note
down
that
amongst
certain
sects
of
christians
it
is
considered
praiseworthy
to
carry
off
courtesans
and
live
upon
columns
you
may
add
that
these
customs
are
evidence
of
the
worship
of
genetic
divinities
but
on
this
point
we
ought
to
question
him
then
raising
his
head
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
to
keep
off
the
sun
he
shouted
hallo
paphnutius
if
you
remember
that
you
were
once
my
guest
answer
me
what
are
you
doing
up
there
why
did
you
go
up
and
why
do
you
stay
there
has
this
column
any
phallic
signification
in
your
mind
paphnutius
considering
cotta
as
nothing
but
an
idolater
did
not
deign
to
reply
but
his
disciple
flavian
approached
and
said
illustrious
sir
this
holy
man
takes
the
sins
of
the
world
upon
him
and
cures
by
jupiter
do
you
hear
aristaeus
cried
cotta
this
practises
medicine
like
you
what
do
you
think
of
so
high
a
rival
aristaeus
shook
his
head
it
is
very
possible
that
he
may
cure
certain
diseases
better
than
i
can
such
for
instance
as
epilepsy
vulgarly
called
the
divine
malady
although
all
maladies
are
equally
divine
for
they
all
come
from
the
gods
but
the
cause
of
this
disease
lies
partly
in
the
imagination
and
you
must
confess
lucius
that
this
monk
perched
up
on
the
head
of
a
goddess
strikes
the
minds
of
the
sick
people
more
forcibly
than
i
bending
over
my
mortars
and
phials
in
my
laboratory
could
ever
do
there
are
forces
lucius
infinitely
more
powerful
than
reason
and
what
are
they
asked
cotta
ignorance
and
folly
replied
aristaeus
i
have
rarely
seen
a
more
curious
sight
continued
cotta
and
i
hope
that
some
day
an
able
writer
will
relate
the
foundation
of
stylopolis
but
even
the
most
extraordinary
spectacles
should
not
keep
longer
than
is
befitting
a
serious
and
busy
man
from
his
work
let
us
go
and
inspect
the
canals
farewell
good
paphnutius
or
rather
till
our
next
meeting
if
ever
you
should
come
down
to
earth
again
and
revisit
alexandria
do
not
fail
to
come
and
sup
with
these
words
heard
by
all
present
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
being
repeated
by
the
believers
added
greatly
to
the
reputation
of
paphnutius
pious
minds
amplified
and
transformed
them
and
it
was
stated
that
paphnutius
from
the
top
of
his
pillar
had
converted
the
prefect
of
the
fleet
to
the
faith
of
the
apostles
and
the
nicaean
fathers
the
believers
found
a
figurative
meaning
in
the
last
words
uttered
by
aurelius
cotta
to
them
the
supper
to
which
this
important
personage
had
invited
the
ascetic
was
a
holy
communion
a
spiritual
repast
a
celestial
banquet
the
story
of
this
meeting
was
embroidered
with
wonderful
details
which
those
who
invented
were
the
first
to
believe
it
was
said
that
when
cotta
after
a
long
argument
had
embraced
the
truth
an
angel
had
come
from
heaven
to
wipe
the
sweat
from
his
brow
the
physician
and
secretary
of
the
prefect
of
the
fleet
had
also
it
was
asserted
been
converted
at
the
same
time
and
the
miracle
being
public
and
notorious
the
deacons
of
the
principal
churches
of
libya
recorded
it
amongst
the
authentic
facts
after
that
it
could
be
said
without
any
exaggeration
that
the
whole
world
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
see
paphnutius
and
that
in
the
west
as
well
as
the
east
all
christians
turned
their
astonished
eyes
towards
him
the
most
celebrated
cities
of
italy
sent
deputations
to
him
and
the
roman
caesar
the
divine
constantine
who
favoured
the
christian
religion
wrote
him
a
letter
which
the
legates
brought
to
him
with
great
ceremony
but
one
night
whilst
the
budding
city
at
his
feet
slept
in
the
dew
he
heard
a
voice
which
said
paphnutius
thou
art
become
celebrated
by
thy
works
and
powerful
by
thy
word
god
has
raised
thee
up
for
his
glory
he
has
chosen
thee
to
work
miracles
heal
the
sick
convert
the
pagans
enlighten
sinners
confound
the
arians
and
establish
peace
in
the
paphnutius
replied
god
s
will
be
done
the
voice
continued
arise
paphnutius
and
go
seek
in
his
palace
the
impious
constans
who
far
from
imitating
the
wisdom
of
his
brother
constantine
inclines
to
the
errors
of
arius
and
marcus
go
the
bronze
gates
shall
fly
open
before
thee
and
thy
sandals
shall
resound
on
the
golden
floor
of
the
basilica
before
the
throne
of
the
caesars
and
thy
voice
shall
change
the
heart
of
the
son
of
constantinus
thou
shalt
reign
over
a
peaceful
and
powerful
church
and
even
as
the
soul
directs
the
body
so
shall
the
church
govern
the
empire
thou
shalt
be
placed
above
senators
comites
and
patricians
thou
shalt
repress
the
greed
of
the
people
and
check
the
boldness
of
the
barbarians
old
cotta
knowing
that
thou
art
the
head
of
the
government
will
seek
the
honour
of
washing
thy
feet
at
thy
death
thy
shall
be
taken
to
the
patriarch
of
alexandria
and
the
great
athanasius
white
with
glory
shall
kiss
it
as
the
relic
of
a
saint
go
paphnutius
replied
let
the
will
of
god
be
accomplished
and
making
an
effort
to
stand
up
he
prepared
to
descend
but
the
voice
divining
his
intention
said
above
all
descend
not
by
the
ladder
that
would
be
to
act
like
an
ordinary
man
and
to
be
unconscious
of
the
gifts
that
are
in
thee
a
great
saint
like
thee
ought
to
fly
through
the
air
leap
the
angels
are
there
to
support
thee
leap
then
paphnutius
replied
the
will
of
god
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
extending
his
long
arms
like
the
ragged
wings
of
a
huge
sick
bird
he
was
about
to
throw
himself
down
when
suddenly
a
hideous
mocking
laugh
rang
in
his
ears
terrified
he
asked
who
laughs
thus
ah
ah
screamed
the
voice
we
are
yet
but
at
the
beginning
of
our
friendship
thou
wilt
some
day
be
better
acquainted
with
me
my
friend
it
was
i
who
caused
thee
to
ascend
here
and
i
ought
to
be
satisfied
at
the
docility
with
which
thou
hast
accomplished
my
wishes
paphnutius
i
am
pleased
with
paphnutius
murmured
in
a
voice
stifled
by
fear
avaunt
avaunt
i
know
thee
now
thou
art
he
who
carried
jesus
to
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
showed
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
this
he
fell
affrighted
on
the
stone
why
did
i
not
know
this
sooner
he
thought
more
wretched
than
the
blind
deaf
and
paralysed
who
trust
in
me
i
have
lost
all
knowledge
of
things
supernatural
and
am
more
depraved
than
the
maniacs
who
eat
earth
and
approach
dead
bodies
i
can
no
longer
distinguish
between
the
clamours
of
hell
and
the
voices
of
heaven
i
have
lost
even
the
intuition
of
the
child
who
cries
when
its
nurse
s
breast
is
taken
from
it
of
the
dog
that
scents
out
its
master
s
footsteps
of
the
plant
that
turns
towards
the
sun
i
am
the
of
the
devils
so
then
it
is
satan
who
led
me
here
when
he
elevated
me
on
this
pedestal
lust
and
pride
mounted
with
me
it
is
not
the
magnitude
of
my
temptations
which
terrifies
me
anthony
on
his
mountain
suffers
the
same
i
wish
that
all
their
swords
may
pierce
my
flesh
before
the
eyes
of
the
angels
i
have
even
learned
to
like
my
sufferings
but
god
does
not
speak
to
me
and
his
silence
astonishes
me
he
has
left
me
and
i
had
but
him
to
look
to
he
leaves
me
alone
in
the
horror
of
his
absence
he
flies
from
me
i
will
follow
after
him
this
stone
burns
my
feet
let
me
leave
quickly
and
come
up
with
with
that
he
seized
the
ladder
which
stood
against
the
column
put
his
feet
on
it
and
having
descended
a
rung
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
monster
s
head
she
smiled
strangely
he
was
certain
then
that
what
he
had
taken
for
the
site
of
his
rest
and
glory
was
but
the
diabolical
instrument
of
his
trouble
and
damnation
he
hastily
descended
and
touched
the
soil
his
feet
had
forgotten
their
use
and
he
reeled
but
feeling
on
him
the
shadow
of
the
cursed
column
he
forced
himself
to
run
all
slept
he
traversed
without
being
seen
the
great
square
surrounded
by
inns
and
caravanserias
and
threw
himself
into
a
which
led
towards
the
libyan
hills
a
dog
pursued
him
barking
and
stopped
only
at
the
edge
of
the
desert
paphnutius
went
through
a
country
where
there
was
no
road
but
the
trail
of
wild
beasts
leaving
behind
him
the
huts
abandoned
by
the
coiners
he
continued
all
night
and
all
day
his
solitary
flight
at
last
almost
ready
to
expire
with
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue
and
not
knowing
if
god
was
still
far
from
him
he
came
to
a
silent
city
which
extended
from
right
to
left
and
stretched
away
till
it
was
lost
in
the
blue
horizon
the
buildings
which
were
widely
separated
and
like
each
other
resembled
pyramids
cut
off
at
half
their
height
they
were
tombs
the
doors
were
broken
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
chambers
could
be
seen
the
gleaming
eyes
of
hyaenas
and
wolves
who
brought
forth
their
young
there
whilst
the
dead
bodies
lay
on
the
threshold
despoiled
by
robbers
and
gnawed
by
the
wild
beasts
having
passed
through
this
funeral
city
paphnutius
fell
exhausted
before
a
tomb
which
stood
near
a
spring
surrounded
by
palm
trees
this
tomb
was
much
ornamented
and
as
there
was
no
door
to
it
he
saw
inside
it
a
painted
chamber
in
which
serpents
bred
here
he
sighed
is
the
abode
i
have
chosen
the
tabernacle
of
my
repentance
and
he
dragged
himself
to
it
drove
out
the
reptiles
with
his
feet
and
remained
prostrate
on
the
stone
floor
for
eighteen
hours
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
went
to
the
spring
and
drank
out
of
his
hand
then
he
plucked
some
dates
and
some
stalks
of
lotus
the
seeds
of
which
he
ate
thinking
this
kind
of
life
was
good
he
made
it
the
rule
of
his
existence
from
morning
to
night
he
never
lifted
his
forehead
from
the
stone
one
day
whilst
he
was
thus
prostrated
he
heard
a
voice
which
said
look
at
these
images
that
thou
mayest
then
raising
his
head
he
saw
on
the
walls
of
the
chamber
paintings
which
represented
lively
and
domestic
scenes
they
were
of
very
old
work
and
marvellously
lifelike
there
were
cooks
who
blew
the
fire
with
their
cheeks
all
puffed
out
others
plucked
geese
or
cooked
quarters
of
sheep
in
a
little
farther
a
hunter
carried
on
his
shoulders
a
gazelle
pierced
with
arrows
in
one
place
peasants
were
sowing
reaping
or
gathering
in
another
women
danced
to
the
sounds
of
viols
flutes
and
harp
a
young
girl
played
the
theorbo
the
lotus
flower
shone
in
her
hair
which
was
neatly
braided
her
transparent
dress
let
the
pure
forms
of
her
body
be
seen
her
bosom
and
mouth
were
perfect
the
face
was
turned
in
profile
and
the
beautiful
eye
looked
straight
before
her
the
whole
figure
was
exquisite
paphnutius
having
examined
it
lowered
his
eyes
and
replied
to
the
voice
why
dost
thou
command
me
to
look
at
these
images
no
doubt
they
represent
the
terrestrial
life
of
the
idolater
whose
body
rests
here
under
my
feet
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
in
a
coffin
of
black
basalt
they
recall
the
life
of
a
dead
man
and
are
despite
their
bright
colours
the
shadows
of
a
shadow
the
life
of
a
dead
man
o
vanity
he
is
dead
but
he
lived
replied
the
voice
and
thou
wilt
die
and
wilt
not
have
from
that
day
paphnutius
had
not
a
moment
s
rest
the
voice
spoke
to
him
incessantly
the
girl
with
the
theorbo
looked
fixedly
at
him
from
underneath
the
long
lashes
of
her
eye
at
last
she
also
spoke
look
i
am
mysterious
and
beautiful
love
me
exhaust
in
my
arms
the
love
which
torments
you
what
use
is
it
to
fear
me
you
can
not
escape
me
i
am
the
beauty
of
woman
whither
do
you
think
to
fly
from
me
senseless
fool
you
will
find
my
likeness
in
the
radiancy
of
flowers
and
in
the
grace
of
the
palm
trees
in
the
flight
of
pigeons
in
the
bounds
of
the
gazelle
in
the
rippling
of
brooks
in
the
soft
light
of
the
moon
and
if
you
close
your
eyes
you
will
find
me
within
yourself
it
is
a
thousand
years
since
the
man
who
sleeps
here
swathed
in
linen
in
a
bed
of
black
stone
pressed
me
to
his
heart
it
is
a
thousand
years
since
he
received
the
last
kiss
from
my
mouth
and
his
sleep
is
yet
redolent
with
it
you
know
me
well
paphnutius
how
is
it
you
have
not
recognised
me
i
am
one
of
the
innumerable
incarnations
of
thais
you
are
a
learned
monk
and
well
skilled
in
the
knowledge
of
things
you
have
travelled
and
it
is
by
travel
a
man
learns
the
most
often
a
day
passed
abroad
will
show
more
novelties
than
ten
years
passed
at
home
you
have
heard
that
thais
lived
formerly
in
argos
under
the
name
of
helen
she
had
another
existence
in
thebes
hecatompyle
and
i
was
thais
of
thebes
how
is
it
you
have
not
guessed
it
i
took
when
i
was
alive
a
large
share
in
the
sins
of
this
world
and
now
reduced
here
to
the
condition
of
a
shadow
i
am
still
quite
capable
of
taking
your
sins
upon
me
beloved
monk
whence
comes
your
surprise
it
was
certain
that
wherever
you
went
you
would
find
thais
he
struck
his
forehead
against
the
pavement
and
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
and
every
night
the
player
of
the
theorbo
left
the
wall
approached
him
and
spoke
in
a
clear
voice
mingled
with
soft
breathing
and
as
the
holy
man
resisted
the
temptations
she
gave
him
she
said
to
him
love
me
yield
friend
as
long
as
you
resist
me
i
shall
torment
you
you
do
not
know
what
the
patience
of
a
dead
woman
is
i
shall
wait
if
necessary
till
you
are
dead
being
a
sorceress
i
shall
put
into
your
lifeless
body
a
spirit
who
will
reanimate
it
and
who
will
not
refuse
me
what
i
have
asked
in
vain
of
you
and
think
paphnutius
what
a
strange
situation
when
your
blessed
soul
sees
from
the
height
of
heaven
its
own
body
given
up
to
sin
god
who
has
promised
to
return
you
this
body
after
the
day
of
judgment
and
the
end
of
time
will
himself
be
much
puzzled
how
can
he
place
in
celestial
glory
a
human
form
inhabited
by
a
devil
and
guarded
by
a
sorceress
you
have
not
thought
of
that
difficulty
nor
god
either
perhaps
between
ourselves
he
is
not
very
knowing
any
ordinary
magician
can
easily
deceive
him
and
if
he
had
not
his
thunder
and
the
cataracts
of
heaven
the
village
urchins
would
pull
his
beard
he
has
certainly
not
as
much
sense
as
the
old
serpent
his
adversary
he
indeed
is
a
wonderful
artist
if
i
am
so
beautiful
it
is
because
he
adorned
me
with
all
my
attractions
it
was
he
who
taught
me
how
to
braid
my
hair
and
to
make
for
myself
rosy
fingers
with
agate
nails
you
have
misunderstood
him
when
you
came
to
live
in
this
tomb
you
drove
out
with
your
feet
the
serpents
which
were
here
without
troubling
yourself
to
know
whether
they
were
of
his
family
and
you
crushed
their
eggs
i
am
afraid
my
poor
friend
you
will
have
a
troublesome
business
on
your
hands
you
were
warned
however
that
he
was
a
musician
and
a
lover
what
have
you
done
you
have
quarrelled
with
science
and
beauty
you
are
altogether
miserable
and
iaveh
does
not
come
to
your
help
it
is
not
probable
that
he
will
come
being
as
great
as
all
things
he
can
not
move
for
want
of
space
and
if
by
an
impossibility
he
made
the
least
movement
all
creation
would
be
pushed
out
of
place
my
handsome
hermit
give
me
a
paphnutius
was
aware
that
great
prodigies
are
performed
by
magic
arts
he
thought
not
without
much
uneasiness
perhaps
the
dead
man
buried
at
my
feet
knows
the
words
written
in
that
mysterious
book
which
exists
hidden
not
far
from
here
at
the
bottom
of
a
royal
tomb
by
virtue
of
these
words
the
dead
taking
the
form
which
they
had
upon
earth
see
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
smiles
of
his
chief
fear
was
that
the
girl
with
the
theorbo
and
the
dead
man
might
come
together
as
they
did
in
their
lifetime
and
that
he
should
see
them
unite
sometimes
he
thought
he
heard
the
sound
of
kissing
he
was
troubled
in
his
mind
and
now
in
the
absence
of
god
he
feared
to
think
as
much
as
to
feel
one
evening
when
he
was
kneeling
prostrate
according
to
his
custom
an
unknown
voice
said
to
him
paphnutius
there
are
on
earth
more
people
than
you
imagine
and
if
i
were
to
show
you
what
i
have
seen
you
would
die
of
astonishment
there
are
men
with
a
single
eye
in
the
middle
of
their
forehead
there
are
men
who
have
but
one
leg
and
advance
by
jumps
there
are
men
who
change
their
sex
and
the
females
become
males
there
are
who
shoot
out
roots
in
the
ground
and
there
are
men
with
no
head
with
two
eyes
a
nose
and
a
mouth
in
their
breast
can
you
honestly
believe
that
jesus
christ
died
for
the
salvation
of
these
men
another
time
he
had
a
vision
he
saw
in
a
strong
light
a
broad
road
rivulets
and
gardens
on
the
road
aristobulus
and
chereas
passed
at
a
gallop
on
their
syrian
horses
and
the
joyous
ardour
of
the
race
reddened
the
cheeks
of
the
two
young
men
beneath
a
portico
callicrates
recited
his
verses
satisfied
pride
trembled
in
his
voice
and
shone
in
his
eyes
in
the
garden
zenothemis
picked
apples
of
gold
and
caressed
a
serpent
with
azure
wings
clad
in
white
and
wearing
a
shining
mitre
hermodorus
meditated
beneath
a
sacred
persea
which
bore
instead
of
flowers
small
heads
of
pure
profile
wearing
like
the
egyptian
goddesses
vultures
hawks
or
the
shining
disk
of
the
moon
whilst
in
the
background
by
the
side
of
a
fountain
nicias
studied
on
an
armillary
sphere
the
harmonious
movements
of
the
stars
then
a
veiled
woman
approached
the
monk
holding
in
her
hand
a
branch
of
myrtle
she
said
to
him
look
some
seek
eternal
beauty
and
place
their
ephemeral
life
in
the
infinite
others
live
without
much
thought
but
by
that
alone
they
submit
to
fair
nature
and
they
are
happy
and
beautiful
in
the
joy
of
living
only
and
give
glory
to
the
supreme
artist
of
all
things
for
man
is
a
noble
hymn
to
god
all
think
that
happiness
is
innocent
and
that
pleasure
is
permitted
to
man
paphnutius
if
they
are
right
what
a
dupe
you
have
been
and
the
vision
vanished
thus
was
paphnutius
tempted
unceasingly
in
body
and
mind
satan
never
gave
him
a
minute
s
repose
the
solitude
of
the
tomb
was
more
peopled
than
the
streets
of
a
great
city
the
devils
shouted
with
laughter
and
millions
of
imps
evil
genii
and
phantoms
imitated
all
the
ordinary
transactions
of
life
in
the
evening
when
he
went
to
the
spring
satyrs
and
nymphs
capered
round
him
and
tried
to
drag
him
into
their
lascivious
dances
the
demons
no
longer
feared
him
they
loaded
him
with
insults
obscene
jests
and
blows
one
day
a
devil
no
longer
than
his
arm
stole
the
cord
he
wore
round
his
waist
he
said
to
himself
thought
whither
hast
thou
led
me
and
he
resolved
to
work
with
his
hands
in
order
to
give
his
mind
that
rest
of
which
it
had
need
near
the
spring
some
banana
trees
with
large
leaves
grew
under
the
shade
of
the
palms
he
cut
the
stalks
and
carried
them
to
the
tomb
he
crushed
them
with
a
stone
and
reduced
them
to
fibres
as
he
had
seen
ropemakers
do
for
he
intended
to
make
a
cord
to
replace
that
which
the
devil
had
stolen
the
demons
were
somewhat
displeased
at
this
they
ceased
their
clamour
and
the
girl
with
the
theorbo
no
longer
continued
her
magic
arts
but
remained
quietly
on
the
wall
the
courage
and
faith
of
paphnutius
increased
whilst
he
pounded
the
banana
stems
with
heaven
s
help
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
subdue
the
flesh
as
to
my
soul
its
confidence
is
still
unshaken
in
vain
do
the
devils
and
that
accursed
woman
try
to
instil
into
my
mind
doubts
as
to
the
nature
of
god
i
will
reply
to
them
by
the
mouth
of
the
apostle
john
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
that
i
firmly
believe
and
that
which
i
believe
is
absurd
i
believe
still
more
firmly
in
fact
it
should
be
absurd
if
it
were
not
so
i
should
not
believe
i
should
know
and
it
is
not
that
which
we
know
which
gives
eternal
life
it
is
faith
only
that
he
exposed
the
separated
fibres
to
the
sun
and
the
dew
and
every
morning
he
took
care
to
turn
them
to
prevent
them
rotting
and
he
rejoiced
to
find
that
he
had
become
as
simple
as
a
child
when
he
had
twisted
his
cord
he
cut
reeds
to
make
mats
and
baskets
the
sepulchral
chamber
resembled
a
s
workshop
and
paphnutius
could
pass
without
difficulty
from
work
to
prayer
yet
still
god
was
not
merciful
to
him
for
one
night
he
was
awakened
by
a
voice
which
froze
him
with
horror
for
he
guessed
that
it
was
the
voice
of
the
dead
man
the
voice
called
quickly
in
a
light
whisper
helen
helen
come
and
bathe
with
me
come
quickly
a
woman
whose
mouth
was
close
to
the
monk
s
ear
replied
friend
i
can
not
rise
a
man
is
lying
on
paphnutius
suddenly
perceived
that
his
cheek
rested
on
a
woman
s
breast
he
recognised
the
player
of
the
theorbo
who
partly
relieved
of
his
weight
raised
her
breast
he
clung
tightly
to
the
sweet
warm
perfumed
body
and
consumed
with
the
desire
of
damnation
he
cried
stay
stay
my
heavenly
one
but
she
was
already
standing
on
the
threshold
she
laughed
and
her
smile
gleamed
in
the
silver
rays
of
the
moon
why
should
i
stay
she
said
the
shadow
of
a
shadow
is
enough
for
a
lover
endowed
with
such
a
lively
imagination
besides
you
have
sinned
what
more
was
needed
paphnutius
wept
in
the
night
and
when
the
dawn
came
he
murmured
a
prayer
that
was
a
meek
complaint
jesus
my
jesus
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
thou
seest
the
danger
in
which
i
am
come
and
help
me
sweet
saviour
since
thy
father
no
longer
loves
me
and
does
not
hear
me
remember
that
i
have
but
thee
from
him
nothing
is
to
be
hoped
i
can
not
comprehend
him
and
he
can
not
pity
me
but
thou
was
born
of
a
woman
and
that
is
why
i
trust
in
thee
remember
that
thou
wast
a
man
i
pray
to
thee
not
because
thou
art
god
of
god
light
of
light
very
god
of
very
god
but
because
thou
hast
lived
poor
and
humble
on
this
earth
where
now
i
suffer
because
satan
has
tempted
thy
flesh
because
the
sweat
of
agony
has
bedewed
thy
face
it
is
to
thy
humanity
that
i
pray
jesus
my
brother
jesus
when
he
had
thus
prayed
wringing
his
hands
a
terrible
peal
of
laughter
shook
the
walls
of
the
tomb
and
the
voice
which
rang
in
his
ears
on
the
top
of
the
column
said
jeeringly
that
is
a
prayer
worthy
of
the
breviary
of
marcus
the
heretic
paphnutius
is
an
arian
paphnutius
is
an
arian
as
though
thunderstruck
the
monk
fell
senseless
when
he
reopened
his
eyes
he
saw
around
him
monks
wearing
black
hoods
who
poured
water
on
his
temples
and
recited
exorcisms
many
others
were
standing
outside
carrying
palm
leaves
as
we
passed
through
the
desert
said
one
of
them
we
heard
cries
issuing
from
this
tomb
and
having
entered
we
found
you
lying
unconscious
on
the
floor
doubtless
the
devils
had
thrown
you
down
and
had
fled
at
our
paphnutius
raising
his
head
asked
in
a
feeble
voice
who
are
you
my
brothers
and
why
do
you
carry
palms
in
your
hands
is
it
for
my
burial
one
of
them
replied
brother
do
you
not
know
that
our
father
anthony
now
a
hundred
and
five
years
old
having
been
warned
of
his
approaching
end
has
come
down
from
mount
colzin
to
which
he
had
retired
to
bless
his
numerous
spiritual
children
we
are
going
with
palm
leaves
to
greet
our
holy
father
but
how
is
it
brother
that
you
are
ignorant
of
such
a
great
event
can
it
be
possible
that
no
angel
came
to
this
tomb
to
inform
you
alas
replied
paphnutius
i
am
not
worthy
of
such
a
favour
and
the
only
denizens
of
this
abode
are
demons
and
vampires
pray
for
me
i
am
paphnutius
abbot
of
antinoe
the
most
wretched
of
the
servants
of
at
the
name
of
paphnutius
all
waved
their
palm
leaves
and
murmured
his
praises
the
monk
who
had
previously
spoken
cried
in
surprise
can
it
be
that
thou
art
that
holy
paphnutius
celebrated
for
so
many
works
that
it
was
supposed
he
would
some
day
equal
the
great
anthony
himself
most
venerable
it
was
thou
who
convertedst
to
god
the
courtesan
thais
and
who
raised
upon
a
high
column
was
carried
away
by
the
seraphs
those
who
watched
by
night
at
the
foot
of
the
pillar
saw
thy
blessed
assumption
the
wings
of
the
angels
encircled
thee
in
a
white
cloud
and
with
thy
right
hand
extended
thou
didst
bless
the
dwellings
of
man
the
next
day
when
the
people
saw
thou
wert
no
longer
there
a
long
groan
rose
to
the
summit
of
the
discrowned
pillar
but
flavian
thy
disciple
reported
the
miracle
and
took
thy
place
as
the
head
but
a
foolish
man
of
the
name
of
paul
tried
to
contradict
the
general
opinion
he
asserted
that
he
had
seen
thee
in
a
dream
carried
away
by
the
devils
the
people
wanted
to
stone
him
and
it
was
a
miracle
that
he
escaped
death
i
am
zozimus
abbot
of
these
solitary
monks
whom
thou
seest
prostrate
at
thy
feet
like
them
i
kneel
before
thee
that
thou
mayest
bless
the
father
with
the
children
then
thou
shalt
relate
to
us
the
marvels
which
god
has
deigned
to
accomplish
by
thy
far
from
having
favoured
me
as
thou
believest
replied
paphnutius
the
lord
has
tried
me
with
terrible
temptations
i
was
not
carried
away
by
angels
but
a
shadowy
wall
is
raised
in
front
of
my
eyes
and
moves
before
me
i
have
lived
in
a
dream
without
god
all
is
a
dream
when
i
made
my
journey
to
alexandria
i
heard
in
a
short
space
of
time
many
discourses
and
i
learned
that
the
army
of
errors
was
innumerable
it
pursues
me
and
i
am
compassed
about
with
zozimus
replied
venerable
father
we
must
remember
that
the
saints
and
especially
the
solitary
saints
undergo
terrible
trials
if
thou
wast
not
carried
to
heaven
by
the
seraphs
it
is
certain
that
the
lord
granted
that
favour
to
thy
image
for
flavian
the
monks
and
the
people
were
witnesses
of
thy
paphnutius
resolved
to
go
and
receive
the
blessing
of
anthony
brother
zozimus
he
said
give
me
one
of
these
palm
leaves
and
let
us
go
and
meet
our
let
us
go
replied
zozimus
military
order
is
most
befitting
for
monks
who
are
god
s
soldiers
thou
and
i
being
abbots
will
march
in
front
and
the
others
shall
follow
us
singing
they
set
out
on
their
march
and
paphnutius
said
god
is
unity
for
he
is
the
truth
which
is
one
the
world
is
many
because
it
is
error
we
should
turn
away
from
all
the
sights
of
nature
even
those
which
appear
the
most
innocent
their
diversity
renders
them
pleasant
which
is
a
sign
that
they
are
evil
for
that
reason
i
can
not
see
a
tuft
of
papyrus
by
the
side
of
still
waters
without
my
soul
being
imbued
with
melancholy
all
things
that
the
senses
perceive
are
detestable
the
least
grain
of
sand
brings
danger
everything
tempts
us
woman
is
but
a
combination
of
all
the
temptations
scattered
in
the
thin
air
on
the
flowering
earth
in
the
clear
waters
happy
is
he
whose
soul
is
a
sealed
vase
happy
is
he
who
knows
how
to
be
deaf
dumb
and
blind
and
who
knows
nothing
of
the
world
in
order
that
he
may
know
god
zozimus
having
meditated
upon
these
words
replied
as
follows
venerable
father
it
is
fitting
that
i
should
avow
my
sins
to
thee
since
thou
hast
shown
me
thy
soul
thus
we
shall
confess
to
each
other
according
to
the
apostolic
custom
before
i
was
a
monk
i
led
an
abominable
life
at
madaura
a
city
celebrated
for
its
courtesans
i
sought
out
all
kinds
of
worldly
love
every
night
i
supped
in
company
with
young
debauchees
and
female
flute
players
and
i
took
home
with
me
the
one
who
pleased
me
the
best
a
saint
like
thee
could
never
imagine
to
what
a
pitch
the
fury
of
my
desires
carried
me
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
spared
neither
matrons
nor
nuns
and
spread
adultery
and
sacrilege
everywhere
i
excited
my
senses
with
wine
and
was
justly
known
as
the
heaviest
drinker
in
madaura
yet
i
was
a
christian
and
in
all
my
follies
kept
my
faith
in
jesus
crucified
having
devoured
my
substance
in
riotous
living
i
was
beginning
to
feel
the
first
attacks
of
poverty
when
i
saw
one
of
my
companions
in
pleasure
suddenly
struck
with
a
terrible
disease
his
knees
could
not
sustain
him
his
twitching
hands
refused
to
obey
him
his
glazed
eyes
closed
only
horrible
groans
came
from
his
breast
his
mind
heavier
than
his
body
slumbered
to
punish
him
for
having
lived
like
a
beast
god
had
changed
him
into
a
beast
the
loss
of
my
property
had
already
inspired
me
with
salutary
reflections
but
the
example
of
my
friend
was
of
yet
greater
efficacy
it
made
such
an
impression
on
my
heart
that
i
quitted
the
world
and
retired
into
the
desert
there
i
have
enjoyed
for
twenty
years
a
peace
that
nothing
has
troubled
i
work
with
my
monks
as
weaver
architect
carpenter
and
even
as
scribe
though
to
say
the
truth
i
have
little
taste
for
writing
having
always
preferred
action
to
thought
my
days
are
full
of
joy
and
my
nights
without
dreams
and
i
believe
that
the
grace
of
the
lord
is
in
me
because
even
in
the
midst
of
the
most
frightful
sins
i
have
never
lost
on
hearing
these
words
paphnutius
lifted
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
murmured
lord
thou
lookest
with
kindness
upon
this
man
polluted
by
adultery
sacrilege
and
so
many
crimes
and
thou
turnest
away
from
me
who
have
always
kept
thy
commandments
how
inscrutable
is
thy
justice
o
my
god
and
how
impenetrable
are
thy
ways
zozimus
extended
his
arms
look
venerable
father
on
both
sides
of
the
horizon
are
long
black
files
that
look
like
emigrant
ants
they
are
our
brothers
who
like
us
are
going
to
meet
when
they
came
to
the
place
of
meeting
they
saw
a
magnificent
spectacle
the
army
of
monks
extended
in
three
ranks
in
an
immense
semicircle
in
the
first
rank
stood
the
old
hermits
of
the
desert
cross
in
hand
and
with
long
beards
that
almost
touched
the
ground
the
monks
governed
by
the
abbots
ephrem
and
serapion
and
also
all
the
cenobites
of
the
nile
formed
the
second
line
behind
them
appeared
the
ascetics
who
had
come
from
their
distant
rocks
some
wore
on
their
blackened
and
bodies
shapeless
rags
others
had
for
their
only
clothes
bundles
of
reeds
held
together
by
withies
many
of
them
were
naked
but
god
had
covered
them
with
a
fell
of
hair
as
thick
as
a
sheep
s
fleece
all
held
branches
of
palm
they
looked
like
an
emerald
rainbow
or
they
might
have
been
also
compared
to
the
host
of
the
elect
the
living
walls
of
the
city
of
god
such
perfect
order
reigned
in
the
assembly
that
paphnutius
found
without
difficulty
the
monks
he
governed
he
placed
himself
near
them
after
having
taken
care
to
hide
his
face
under
his
hood
that
he
might
remain
unknown
and
not
disturb
them
in
their
pious
expectation
suddenly
an
immense
shout
arose
the
saint
they
all
cried
the
saint
behold
the
great
saint
against
whom
hell
has
not
prevailed
the
of
god
our
father
anthony
then
a
great
silence
followed
and
every
forehead
was
lowered
to
the
sand
from
the
summit
of
a
dune
in
the
vast
void
space
anthony
advanced
supported
by
his
beloved
disciples
macarius
and
amathas
he
walked
slowly
but
his
figure
was
still
upright
and
showed
the
remains
of
a
superhuman
strength
his
white
beard
spread
over
his
broad
chest
his
polished
skull
reflected
the
rays
of
sunlight
like
the
forehead
of
moses
the
keen
gaze
of
the
eagle
was
in
his
eyes
the
smile
of
a
child
shone
on
his
round
cheek
to
bless
his
people
he
raised
his
arms
tired
by
a
century
of
marvellous
works
and
his
voice
burst
forth
for
the
last
time
with
the
words
of
love
how
goodly
are
thy
tents
o
jacob
and
thy
tabernacles
o
israel
immediately
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
living
wall
like
a
peal
of
harmonious
thunder
the
psalm
blessed
is
the
man
that
feareth
the
lord
broke
forth
accompanied
by
macarius
and
amathas
anthony
passed
along
the
ranks
of
the
old
hermits
anchorites
and
cenobites
this
seer
who
had
beheld
heaven
and
hell
this
hermit
who
from
a
cave
in
the
rock
governed
the
christian
church
this
saint
who
had
sustained
the
faith
of
the
martyrs
this
scholar
whose
eloquence
had
paralysed
the
heretics
spoke
tenderly
to
each
of
his
sons
and
bade
them
a
kindly
farewell
on
the
eve
of
the
blessed
death
which
god
who
loved
him
had
at
last
promised
him
he
said
to
the
abbots
ephrem
and
serapion
you
command
large
armies
and
you
are
both
great
generals
therefore
you
shall
put
on
in
heaven
an
armour
of
gold
and
the
archangel
michael
shall
give
you
the
title
of
kiliarchs
of
his
perceiving
the
old
man
philemon
he
embraced
him
and
said
behold
the
kindest
and
best
of
all
my
children
his
soul
exhales
a
perfume
as
sweet
as
the
flower
of
the
beans
he
sows
every
to
abbot
zozimus
he
addressed
these
words
thou
hast
never
mistrusted
divine
goodness
and
therefore
the
peace
of
the
lord
is
in
thee
the
lily
of
thy
virtues
has
flowered
upon
the
dunghill
of
thy
to
all
he
spoke
words
of
unerring
wisdom
to
the
old
hermits
he
said
the
apostle
saw
round
the
throne
of
god
eighty
old
men
seated
clad
in
white
robes
and
wearing
crowns
on
their
to
the
young
men
be
joyful
leave
sadness
to
the
happy
ones
of
this
thus
he
passed
along
the
front
of
his
filial
army
exhorting
and
comforting
paphnutius
seeing
him
approach
fell
on
his
knees
his
heart
torn
by
fear
and
hope
my
father
my
father
he
cried
in
his
agony
my
father
come
to
my
help
for
i
perish
i
have
given
to
god
the
soul
of
thais
i
have
lived
upon
the
top
of
a
column
and
in
the
chamber
of
a
tomb
my
forehead
unceasingly
in
the
dust
has
become
horny
as
a
camel
s
knee
and
yet
god
has
gone
from
me
bless
me
my
father
and
i
shall
be
saved
shake
the
hyssop
and
i
shall
be
washed
and
i
shall
shine
as
the
anthony
did
not
reply
he
turned
to
the
monks
of
antinoe
those
eyes
whose
looks
no
man
could
sustain
he
gazed
for
a
long
time
at
paul
called
the
fool
then
he
made
a
sign
to
him
to
approach
and
as
all
were
astonished
that
the
saint
should
address
himself
to
a
man
who
was
not
in
his
senses
anthony
said
god
has
granted
to
him
more
grace
than
to
any
of
you
lift
thy
eyes
my
son
paul
and
tell
me
what
thou
seest
in
paul
the
fool
raised
his
eyes
his
face
shone
and
his
tongue
was
unloosed
i
see
in
heaven
he
said
a
bed
adorned
with
hangings
of
purple
and
gold
around
it
three
virgins
keep
constant
watch
that
no
soul
may
approach
it
except
the
chosen
one
for
whom
the
bed
is
believing
that
this
bed
was
the
symbol
of
his
glorification
paphnutius
had
already
begun
to
return
thanks
to
god
but
anthony
made
a
sign
to
him
to
be
silent
and
to
listen
to
the
fool
who
murmured
in
his
ecstasy
the
three
virgins
speak
to
me
they
say
unto
me
a
saint
is
about
to
quit
the
earth
thais
of
alexandria
is
dying
and
we
have
prepared
the
bed
of
her
glory
for
we
are
her
virtues
faith
fear
and
anthony
asked
sweet
child
what
else
seest
thou
paul
gazed
vacantly
from
the
zenith
to
the
nadir
and
from
west
to
east
when
suddenly
his
eyes
fell
on
the
abbot
of
antinoe
his
face
grew
pale
with
a
holy
terror
and
his
eyeballs
reflected
invisible
flames
i
see
he
murmured
three
demons
who
full
of
joy
prepare
to
seize
that
man
one
of
them
is
like
unto
a
tower
one
to
a
woman
and
one
to
a
mage
all
three
bear
their
name
marked
with
iron
the
first
on
the
forehead
the
second
on
the
belly
the
third
on
the
breast
and
those
names
are
pride
lust
and
doubt
i
have
having
spoken
thus
paul
with
haggard
eyes
and
hanging
jaw
returned
to
his
old
simple
ways
and
as
the
monks
of
antinoe
looked
anxiously
at
anthony
the
saint
pronounced
these
words
god
has
made
known
his
just
judgment
let
us
bow
to
him
and
hold
our
he
passed
he
bestowed
blessings
as
he
went
the
sun
now
descended
to
the
horizon
enveloped
him
in
its
glory
and
his
shadow
immeasurably
elongated
by
a
miracle
from
heaven
unrolled
itself
behind
him
like
an
endless
carpet
as
a
sign
of
the
long
remembrance
this
great
saint
would
leave
amongst
men
upright
but
thunderstruck
paphnutius
saw
and
heard
nothing
more
one
word
alone
rang
in
his
ears
thais
is
dying
the
thought
had
never
occurred
to
him
twenty
years
had
he
contemplated
a
mummy
s
head
and
yet
the
idea
that
death
would
close
the
eyes
of
thais
astonished
him
hopelessly
thais
is
dying
an
incomprehensible
saying
thais
is
dying
in
those
three
words
what
a
new
and
terrible
sense
thais
is
dying
then
why
the
sun
the
flowers
the
brooks
and
all
creation
thais
is
dying
what
good
was
all
the
universe
suddenly
he
sprang
forward
to
see
her
again
to
see
her
once
more
he
began
to
run
he
knew
not
where
he
was
or
whither
he
went
but
instinct
conducted
him
with
unerring
certainty
he
went
straight
to
the
nile
a
swarm
of
sails
covered
the
upper
waters
of
the
river
he
sprang
on
board
a
barque
manned
by
nubians
and
lying
in
the
forepart
of
the
boat
his
eyes
devouring
space
he
cried
in
grief
and
rage
fool
fool
that
i
was
not
to
have
possessed
thais
whilst
there
was
yet
time
fool
to
have
believed
that
there
was
anything
else
in
the
world
but
her
oh
madness
i
dreamed
of
god
of
the
salvation
of
my
soul
of
life
eternal
as
if
all
that
counted
for
anything
when
i
had
seen
thais
why
did
i
not
feel
that
blessed
eternity
was
in
a
single
kiss
of
that
woman
and
that
without
her
life
was
senseless
and
no
more
than
an
evil
dream
oh
stupid
fool
thou
hast
seen
her
and
thou
hast
desired
the
good
things
of
the
other
world
oh
coward
thou
hast
seen
her
and
thou
hast
feared
god
god
heaven
what
are
they
and
what
have
they
to
offer
thee
which
are
worth
the
least
tittle
of
that
which
she
would
have
given
thee
oh
miserable
senseless
fool
who
sought
divine
goodness
elsewhere
than
on
the
lips
of
thais
what
hand
was
upon
thy
eyes
cursed
be
he
who
blinded
thee
then
thou
couldst
have
bought
at
the
price
of
thy
damnation
one
moment
of
her
love
and
thou
hast
not
done
it
she
opened
to
thee
her
arms
flesh
mingled
with
the
perfume
of
flowers
and
thou
wast
not
engulfed
in
the
unspeakable
enchantments
of
her
unveiled
breast
thou
hast
listened
to
the
jealous
voice
which
said
to
thee
refrain
dupe
dupe
miserable
dupe
oh
regrets
oh
remorse
oh
despair
not
to
have
the
joy
to
carry
to
hell
the
memory
of
that
hour
and
to
cry
to
god
burn
my
flesh
dry
up
all
the
blood
in
my
veins
break
all
my
bones
thou
canst
not
take
from
me
the
remembrance
which
sweetens
and
refreshes
me
for
ever
and
ever
thais
is
dying
preposterous
god
if
thou
knewest
how
i
laugh
at
thy
hell
thais
is
dying
and
she
will
never
be
mine
never
never
and
as
the
boat
came
down
the
river
with
the
current
he
remained
whole
days
lying
on
his
face
and
repeating
never
never
never
then
at
the
idea
that
she
had
given
herself
to
others
and
not
to
him
that
she
had
poured
forth
an
ocean
of
love
and
he
had
not
wetted
his
lips
therein
he
stood
up
savagely
wild
and
howled
with
grief
he
tore
his
breast
with
his
nails
and
bit
the
flesh
of
his
arms
he
thought
if
i
could
but
kill
all
those
she
has
loved
the
idea
of
these
murders
filled
him
with
delicious
fury
he
dreamed
of
killing
nicias
slowly
and
leisurely
looking
him
full
in
the
eyes
whilst
he
murdered
him
then
suddenly
his
fury
melted
away
he
wept
he
sobbed
he
became
feeble
and
meek
an
unknown
tenderness
softened
his
soul
he
longed
to
throw
his
arms
round
the
neck
of
the
companion
of
his
childhood
and
say
to
him
nicias
i
love
thee
because
thou
hast
loved
her
talk
to
me
about
her
tell
me
what
she
said
to
and
still
without
ceasing
the
iron
of
that
phrase
entered
into
his
soul
thais
is
dying
light
of
day
silvery
shadows
of
night
stars
heavens
trees
with
trembling
crests
savage
beasts
domestic
animals
all
the
anxious
souls
of
men
do
you
not
hear
thais
is
dying
disappear
ye
lights
breezes
and
perfumes
hide
yourselves
ye
shapes
and
thoughts
of
the
universe
thais
is
dying
she
was
the
beauty
of
the
world
and
all
that
drew
near
to
her
grew
fairer
in
the
reflection
of
her
grace
the
old
man
and
the
sages
who
sat
near
her
at
the
banquet
at
alexandria
how
pleasant
they
were
and
how
fascinating
was
their
conversation
a
host
of
brilliant
thoughts
sprang
to
their
lips
and
all
their
ideas
were
steeped
in
pleasure
and
it
was
because
the
breath
of
thais
was
on
them
that
all
they
said
was
love
beauty
truth
a
delightful
impiety
lent
its
grace
to
their
discourse
they
thoroughly
expressed
all
human
splendour
alas
all
that
is
but
a
dream
thais
is
dying
oh
how
easy
it
will
be
to
me
to
die
of
her
death
but
canst
thou
only
die
withered
embryo
fetus
steeped
in
gall
and
scalding
tears
miserable
abortion
dost
thou
think
thou
canst
taste
death
thou
who
hast
never
known
life
if
only
god
exists
that
he
may
damn
me
i
hope
for
it
i
wish
it
god
i
hate
thee
dost
thou
hear
overwhelm
me
with
thy
damnation
to
compel
thee
to
i
spit
in
thy
face
i
must
find
an
eternal
hell
to
exhaust
the
eternity
of
rage
which
consumes
the
next
day
at
dawn
albina
received
the
abbot
of
antinoe
at
the
nunnery
thou
art
welcome
to
our
tabernacles
of
peace
venerable
father
for
no
doubt
thou
comest
to
bless
the
saint
thou
hast
given
us
thou
knowest
that
god
in
his
mercy
has
called
her
to
him
how
couldst
thou
fail
to
know
tidings
that
the
angels
have
carried
from
desert
to
desert
it
is
true
that
thais
is
about
to
meet
her
blessed
death
her
labours
are
accomplished
and
i
ought
to
inform
thee
in
a
few
words
as
to
her
conduct
whilst
she
was
still
amongst
us
after
thy
departure
when
she
was
confined
in
a
cell
sealed
with
thy
seal
i
sent
her
with
her
food
a
flute
similar
to
those
which
girls
of
her
profession
play
at
banquets
i
did
that
to
prevent
her
from
falling
into
a
melancholy
mood
and
that
she
should
not
show
less
skill
and
talent
before
god
than
she
had
shown
before
men
in
this
i
showed
prudence
and
foresight
for
all
day
long
thais
praised
the
lord
upon
the
flute
and
the
virgins
who
were
attracted
by
the
sound
of
this
invisible
flute
said
we
hear
the
nightingale
of
the
heavenly
groves
the
dying
swan
of
jesus
thus
did
thais
perform
her
penance
when
after
sixty
days
the
door
which
thou
hadst
sealed
opened
of
itself
and
the
clay
seal
was
broken
without
being
touched
by
any
human
hand
by
that
sign
i
knew
that
the
trial
thou
hadst
imposed
upon
her
was
at
an
end
and
that
god
had
pardoned
the
sins
of
the
from
that
time
she
has
shared
the
ordinary
life
of
my
nuns
working
and
praying
with
them
she
was
an
example
to
them
by
the
modesty
of
her
acts
and
words
and
seemed
like
a
statue
of
purity
amongst
them
sometimes
she
was
sad
but
those
clouds
soon
passed
when
i
saw
that
she
was
really
drawn
towards
god
by
faith
hope
and
love
i
did
not
hesitate
to
employ
her
talent
and
even
her
beauty
for
the
improvement
of
her
sisters
i
asked
her
to
represent
before
us
the
actions
of
the
famous
women
and
wise
virgins
of
the
scriptures
she
acted
esther
deborah
judith
mary
the
sister
of
lazarus
and
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
i
know
venerable
father
that
thy
austere
mind
is
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
these
performances
but
thou
thyself
wouldest
have
been
touched
if
thou
hadst
seen
her
in
these
pious
scenes
shedding
real
tears
and
raising
to
heaven
arms
graceful
as
palm
leaves
i
have
long
governed
a
community
of
women
and
i
make
it
a
rule
never
to
oppose
their
nature
all
seeds
give
not
the
same
flowers
not
all
souls
are
sanctified
in
the
same
way
it
must
also
not
be
forgotten
that
thais
gave
herself
to
god
whilst
she
was
still
beautiful
and
such
a
sacrifice
is
if
not
unexampled
at
least
very
rare
this
beauty
her
natural
vesture
has
not
left
her
during
the
three
months
fever
of
which
she
is
dying
as
during
her
illness
she
has
incessantly
asked
to
see
the
sky
i
have
her
carried
every
morning
into
the
courtyard
near
the
well
under
the
old
fig
tree
in
the
shade
of
which
the
abbesses
of
this
convent
are
accustomed
to
hold
their
meetings
thou
wilt
find
her
there
venerable
father
but
hasten
for
god
calls
her
and
this
night
a
shroud
will
cover
that
face
which
god
made
both
to
shame
and
to
edify
this
paphnutius
followed
her
into
a
courtyard
flooded
with
the
morning
light
on
the
edge
of
the
brick
roofs
the
pigeons
formed
a
string
of
pearls
on
a
bed
in
the
shade
of
the
fig
tree
thais
lay
quite
white
her
arms
crossed
by
her
side
stood
veiled
women
reciting
the
prayers
for
the
dying
have
mercy
upon
me
o
god
according
to
thy
loving
kindness
according
unto
the
multitude
of
thy
tender
mercies
blot
out
my
he
called
her
thais
she
raised
her
eyelids
and
turned
the
whites
of
her
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
albina
made
a
sign
to
the
veiled
women
to
retire
a
few
paces
thais
repeated
the
monk
she
raised
her
head
a
light
breath
came
from
her
pale
lips
is
it
thou
my
father
dost
thou
remember
the
water
of
the
spring
and
the
dates
that
we
picked
that
day
my
father
love
was
born
in
my
heart
the
love
of
life
she
was
silent
and
her
head
fell
back
death
was
upon
her
and
the
sweat
of
the
last
agony
bedewed
her
forehead
a
pigeon
broke
the
still
silence
with
its
plaintive
cooing
then
the
sobs
of
the
monk
mingled
with
the
psalms
of
the
virgins
wash
me
thoroughly
from
mine
iniquity
and
cleanse
me
from
my
sin
for
i
acknowledge
my
transgressions
and
my
sin
is
ever
before
suddenly
thais
sat
up
in
the
bed
her
violet
eyes
opened
wide
and
with
a
rapt
gaze
her
arms
stretched
towards
the
distant
hills
she
said
in
a
clear
fresh
voice
behold
them
the
roses
of
the
eternal
dawn
her
eyes
shone
a
slight
flush
suffused
her
face
she
had
revived
more
sweet
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
paphnutius
knelt
down
and
threw
his
long
black
arms
around
her
do
not
die
he
cried
in
a
strange
voice
which
he
himself
did
not
recognise
i
love
thee

not
die

thais
i
have
deceived
thee
i
was
but
a
wretched
fool
god

that

but
this
worldly
life
and
the
love
of
human
beings
i
love
thee

not
die
that
would
be
impossible
thou
art
too
precious

me

will
carry
thee
far
away
in
my
arms
come

us

my
beloved
and
say
i
will

i
wish

thais
arise
she
did
not
hear
him
her
eyes
gazed
into
infinity
she
murmured
heaven

i
see
the
angels
the
prophets
and
the
saints
the
good
theodore
is
amongst
them
his
hands
filled
with
flowers
he
smiles
on
me
and
calls
me
two
angels

to
me
they
draw
near
how
beautiful
they
are
i
see
god
she
uttered
a
joyful
sigh
and
her
head
fell
back
motionless
on
the
pillow
thais
was
dead
paphnutius
held
her
in
a
last
despairing
embrace
his
eyes
devoured
her
with
desire
rage
and
love
albina
cried
to
him
avaunt
accursed
wretch
and
she
gently
placed
her
fingers
on
the
eyelids
of
the
dead
girl
paphnutius
staggered
back
his
eyes
burning
with
flames
and
feeling
the
earth
open
beneath
his
feet
the
virgins
chanted
the
song
of
zacharias
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
suddenly
their
voices
stayed
in
their
throat
they
had
seen
the
monk
s
face
and
they
fled
in
affright
crying
a
vampire
a
vampire
he
had
become
so
repulsive
that
passing
his
hand
over
his
face
he
felt
his
own
hideousness
