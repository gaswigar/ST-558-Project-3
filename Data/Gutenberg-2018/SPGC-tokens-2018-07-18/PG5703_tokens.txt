the

who
had
held
down
the
lower
end
of
a
quartet
in
his
university
days
growled
an
accompaniment
under
his
breath
as
he
blithely
peeled
the
potatoes
occasionally
a
note
or
two
came
from
the
direction
of
the
engineer
he
could
not
spare
much
wind
while
clambering
about
the
machinery
in
hand
the
architect
alone
ignored
the
famous
tune
what
i
ca
understand
smith
he
insisted
is
how
you
draw
the
electricity
from
the
ether
into
this
car
without
blasting
us
all
to
cinders
the
engineer
squinted
through
an
opal
glass
shutter
into
one
of
the
tunnels
through
which
the
current
was
pouring
if
you
did
know
any
more
about
buildings
than
you
do
about
machinery
jackson
he
grunted
because
of
his
squatting
position
i
hate
to
live
in
one
of
your
houses
the
architect
smiled
grimly
you
living
in
one
of
right
now
smith
said
he
that
is
if
you
call
this
car
a
house
smith
straightened
up
he
was
an
man
of
medium
height
and
build
and
bearing
a
mild
expression
nobody
would
ever
look
at
him
twice
would
ever
guess
that
his
skull
concealed
an
unusually
complete
knowledge
of
electricity
mechanisms
and
such
practical
matters
i
told
you
yesterday
jackson
he
said
that
the
air
surrounding
the
earth
is
chock
full
of
electricity
and
and
that
the
higher
we
go
the
more
juice
added
the
other
remembering
as
much
as
to
say
that
it
is
the
atmosphere
then
that
protects
the
earth
from
the
surrounding
voltage
the
engineer
nodded
occasionally
it
breaks
through
anyhow
in
the
form
of
lightning
now
in
order
to
control
that
current
and
prevent
it
from
turning
this
machine
and
us
into
ashes
all
we
do
is
to
pass
the
juice
through
a
cylinder
of
highly
compressed
air
fixed
in
this
wall
by
varying
the
pressure
and
dampness
within
the
cylinder
we
can
regulate
the
flow
the
builder
nodded
rapidly
all
right
but
why
does
the
electricity
affect
the
walls
themselves
i
thought
they
were
made
of
steel
the
engineer
glanced
through
the
at
the
reddish
disk
of
the
earth
hazy
and
indistinct
at
a
distance
of
forty
million
miles
it
is
steel
it
a
alloy
besides
there
a
layer
of
crystalline
sulphur
between
the
alloy
and
the
vacuum
space
the
vacuum
is
what
keeps
out
the
cold
is
it
jackson
knew
but
he
asked
in
order
to
learn
more
keeps
out
the
sun
heat
too
the
outer
shell
is
pretty
blamed
hot
on
that
side
just
as
hot
as
it
is
cold
on
the
shady
side
smith
seated
himself
beside
a
huge
electrical
machine
a
rotary
converter
which
he
next
indicated
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
but
you
do
want
to
forget
that
the
juice
outside
is
no
use
to
us
the
way
it
is
we
have
to
change
it
it
neither
positive
nor
negative
it
just
neutral
so
we
separate
it
into
two
parts
and
all
we
have
to
do
when
we
want
to
get
away
from
the
earth
or
any
other
is
to
aim
a
bunch
of
positive
current
at
the
corresponding
pole
of
the
planet
or
negative
current
at
the
other
pole
like
poles
repel
you
know
listens
easy
commented
jackson
too
easy
well
it
is
exactly
as
simple
as
all
that
takes
a
lot
of
apparatus
all
told
and
the
engineer
looked
about
the
room
his
glance
resting
fondly
on
his
beloved
machinery
the
big
room
fifty
feet
square
was
almost
filled
with
machines
some
reached
nearly
to
the
ceiling
the
same
distance
above
in
fact
the
interior
of
the
cube
as
that
form
of
was
known
had
very
little
waste
space
the
living
quarters
of
the
four
men
who
occupied
it
had
to
be
fitted
in
wherever
there
happened
to
be
room
the
own
berth
was
sandwiched
in
between
two
huge
dynamos
he
was
thinking
hard
i
see
now
why
you
have
such
a
lot
of
adjustments
for
those
tunnels
meaning
the
six
square
tubes
which
opened
into
the
ether
through
the
six
walls
of
the
room
you
got
to
point
the
juice
pretty
accurately
i
should
say
so
smith
led
the
way
to
a
window
and
the
two
shaded
their
eyes
from
the
lights
within
while
they
gazed
at
the
ashy
glow
of
mercury
toward
which
they
were
traveling
i
got
to
adjust
the
current
so
as
to
point
exactly
toward
his
northern
half
smith
might
have
added
that
a
continual
stream
of
repelling
current
was
still
directed
toward
the
earth
and
another
toward
the
sun
away
over
to
their
right
both
to
prevent
being
drawn
off
their
course
and
how
fast
are
we
going
four
or
five
times
as
fast
as
mother
earth
between
eighty
and
ninety
miles
per
second
it
easy
to
get
up
speed
out
here
of
course
where
there
no
air
resistance
another
voice
broke
in
the
geologist
had
finished
his
potatoes
and
a
savory
smell
was
already
issuing
from
the
frying
pan
years
spent
in
the
wilderness
had
made
the
geologist
a
good
cook
and
doubly
welcome
as
a
member
of
the
expedition
we
ought
to
get
there
tomorrow
then
he
said
eagerly
indoor
life
did
not
appeal
to
him
even
under
such
exciting
circumstances
he
peered
at
mercury
through
his
binoculars
beginning
to
show
up
fine
now
the
builder
improved
upon
van
emmon
example
by
setting
up
the
biggest
telescope
a
tube
of
unusual
excellence
all
three
pronounced
the
planet
which
was
full
as
they
viewed
it
as
having
pretty
much
the
appearance
of
the
moon
wonder
why
there
always
been
so
much
mystery
about
mercury
pondered
the
architect
invitingly
looks
as
though
the
big
telescope
on
mt
wilson
would
have
shown
everything
ask
doc
suggested
smith
diplomatically
jackson
turned
and
hailed
the
little
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
car
he
looked
up
absently
from
the
scientific
apparatus
with
which
he
had
been
making
a
test
of
the
room
chemically
purified
air
then
he
stepped
to
the
oxygen
tanks
and
closed
the
flow
a
trifle
referring
to
his
figures
in
the
severely
exact
manner
of
his
craft
he
crossed
to
the
group
mercury
is
so
close
to
the
sun
he
answered
the
architect
question
he
always
been
hard
to
observe
for
a
long
time
the
astronomers
could
even
agree
that
he
always
keeps
the
same
face
toward
the
sun
like
the
moon
toward
the
earth
then
his
day
is
as
long
as
his
year
of
our
days
yes
continual
sunlight
he
ca
be
inhabited
then
the
architect
knew
very
little
about
the
planets
he
had
been
included
in
the
party
because
along
with
his
professional
knowledge
he
possessed
remarkable
ability
as
an
amateur
antiquarian
he
knew
as
much
about
the
doings
of
the
ancients
as
the
average
man
knows
of
baseball
kinney
shook
his
head
not
at
present
certainly
instantly
jackson
was
alert
then
perhaps
there
were
people
there
at
one
time
why
not
the
doctor
put
it
lightly
there
little
or
no
atmosphere
there
now
of
course
but
that
not
saying
there
never
has
been
even
if
he
is
such
a
little
planet
less
than
three
thousand
smaller
than
the
moon
he
must
have
had
plenty
of
air
and
water
at
one
time
the
same
as
the
earth
what
become
of
the
air
van
emmon
wanted
to
know
kinney
eyed
him
in
reproach
he
said
you
ought
to
know
mercury
has
only
as
much
gravitation
as
the
earth
a
man
weighing
a
hundred
and
fifty
back
home
would
be
only
a
there
and
you
ca
expect
stuff
as
light
as
air
to
stay
forever
on
a
planet
with
no
more
pull
than
that
when
the
sun
is
on
the
job
only
millions
miles
away
about
a
third
as
far
as
from
the
earth
to
the
sun
commented
the
engineer
by
george
it
must
be
hot
on
the
sunlit
side
yes
said
kinney
on
the
dark
side
it
is
as
cold
as
space
itself
four
hundred
and
sixty
below
fahrenheit
they
considered
this
in
silence
for
some
minutes
the
builder
went
to
another
window
and
looked
at
venus
at
that
time
about
sixty
million
miles
distant
on
the
far
side
of
the
sun
they
were
intending
to
visit
earth
twin
sister
on
their
return
after
a
while
he
came
back
to
the
group
ready
with
another
question
if
mercury
ever
was
inhabited
then
his
day
was
as
long
as
it
is
now
was
it
no
said
the
doctor
in
all
probability
he
once
had
a
day
the
same
length
as
ours
mercury
is
a
comparatively
old
planet
you
know
being
smaller
he
cooled
off
earlier
than
the
earth
and
has
been
more
affected
by
the
pull
of
the
sun
but
it
been
a
mighty
long
time
since
he
had
a
day
like
ours
before
the
earth
was
cool
enough
to
live
on
probably
but
since
mercury
was
made
out
of
the
same
batch
of
material
prompted
the
geologist
no
reason
then
why
life
should
have
existed
there
in
the
past
exclaimed
the
architect
his
eyes
sparkling
with
the
instinct
of
the
born
antiquarian
he
glanced
up
eagerly
as
the
doctor
coughed
apologetically
and
said
do
forget
that
even
if
mercury
is
part
baked
and
part
frozen
there
must
be
a
region
in
between
which
is
neither
he
picked
up
a
small
globe
from
the
table
and
ran
a
finger
completely
around
it
from
pole
to
pole
so
there
must
be
a
narrow
band
of
country
where
the
sun
is
only
partly
above
the
horizon
and
where
the
climate
is
temperate
then
the
architect
almost
shouted
in
his
excitement
an
excitement
only
slightly
greater
than
that
of
the
other
two
then
if
there
were
people
on
mercury
at
one
time
the
doctor
nodded
gravely
there
may
be
some
there
now
ii
a
dead
city
from
a
height
of
a
few
thousand
miles
mercury
at
first
glance
strongly
reminded
them
of
the
moon
the
general
effect
was
the
same
leaden
disk
with
slight
prominences
here
and
there
on
the
circumference
and
large
irregular
splotches
of
a
darkish
shade
relieved
by
a
great
many
brilliantly
lighted
areas
lines
and
spots
a
second
glance
however
found
a
marked
difference
instead
of
the
craters
which
always
distinguished
the
moon
mercury
showed
ranges
of
bona
fide
mountains
the
doctor
gave
a
sigh
of
regret
mixed
with
a
generous
amount
of
excitement
too
bad
those
mountains
were
distinguishable
from
the
earth
he
complained
we
would
have
been
so
quick
to
brand
mercury
a
dead
world
the
others
were
too
engrossed
to
comment
the
was
rapidly
sinking
nearer
and
nearer
the
planet
already
smith
had
stopped
the
current
with
which
he
had
attracted
the
cube
toward
the
little
northern
hemisphere
and
was
now
using
negative
voltage
this
in
order
to
act
as
a
brake
and
prevent
them
from
falling
to
destruction
suddenly
van
emmon
the
geologist
whose
eyes
had
been
glued
to
his
binoculars
gave
an
exclamation
of
wonder
look
at
those
faults
he
pointed
toward
a
region
south
of
that
for
which
they
were
bound
what
might
be
called
the
planet
torrid
zone
at
first
it
was
hard
to
see
then
little
by
little
there
unfolded
before
their
eyes
a
giant
spiderlike
system
of
chasms
in
the
strange
surface
beneath
them
from
a
point
almost
directly
opposite
the
sun
these
cracks
radiated
in
a
different
directions
vast
irregular
clefts
they
ran
through
mountain
and
plain
alike
in
places
they
must
have
been
hundreds
of
miles
wide
while
there
was
no
guessing
as
to
their
depth
for
all
that
the
four
in
the
cube
could
see
they
were
bottomless
small
likelihood
of
anybody
being
alive
there
now
commented
the
geologist
skeptically
if
the
sun
has
dried
it
out
enough
to
produce
faults
like
that
how
could
animal
life
exist
notice
however
prompted
the
doctor
that
the
cracks
do
not
extend
all
the
way
to
the
edge
of
the
disk
this
was
true
all
the
great
chasms
ended
far
short
of
the
twilight
band
which
the
doctor
had
declared
might
still
contain
life
but
as
the
rushed
downward
their
attention
became
fixed
upon
the
surface
directly
beneath
them
a
point
whose
latitude
corresponded
roughly
with
that
of
new
york
on
the
earth
it
was
a
region
of
mountains
decidedly
different
from
various
precipitous
ranges
to
be
seen
to
the
north
and
east
on
the
west
or
side
of
this
district
a
comparatively
level
stretch
with
an
occasional
peak
or
two
projecting
suggested
the
ancient
bed
of
an
ocean
by
this
time
they
were
within
a
thousand
miles
smith
threw
on
a
little
more
current
their
speed
diminished
to
a
safer
point
and
they
scanned
the
approaching
surface
with
the
greatest
of
care
the
architect
who
was
a
new
yorker
was
strongly
reminded
of
the
fall
aspect
of
the
appalachians
but
van
emmon
who
was
born
and
raised
on
the
pacific
coast
declared
that
the
spot
was
almost
exactly
like
the
region
north
of
san
francisco
if
i
did
know
where
i
was
he
declared
i
be
trying
to
locate
eureka
right
now
the
engineer
smiled
tolerantly
he
had
spent
several
years
in
scotland
and
he
felt
sure
he
obligingly
told
the
others
that
this
new
locality
was
far
more
like
the
ben
lomond
country
than
any
other
spot
on
earth
he
was
so
positive
he
made
the
doctor
a
new
zealander
smile
quite
broadly
it
is
just
like
the
hills
near
my
home
he
stated
with
an
air
of
finality
which
made
further
discussion
useless
there
a
river
the
architect
suddenly
exclaimed
pointing
then
added
before
the
others
could
comment
i
mean
what
was
once
a
river
they
saw
that
he
was
right
an
irregular
but
streak
of
sandy
hue
trickled
down
the
middle
of
their
chosen
destination
a
long
valley
surrounded
by
low
hills
that
the
most
likely
place
outside
of
the
twilight
zone
for
life
to
be
found
remarked
the
doctor
neither
mountainous
nor
dead
level
he
added
the
spectroscope
has
plainly
shown
that
there
water
vapor
in
what
little
air
there
is
must
be
precious
little
if
the
air
was
as
humid
as
the
earth
we
could
see
the
surface
at
all
from
this
height
the
valley
was
now
less
than
a
hundred
miles
below
inviting
however
only
in
outline
in
color
it
was
a
grayish
buff
scorched
and
forbidding
the
hills
were
yellower
and
an
alkali
white
on
their
summits
do
either
of
you
fellows
see
anything
green
demanded
the
engineer
a
little
later
they
were
silent
each
had
noticed
long
before
that
not
even
near
the
poles
was
there
the
slightest
sign
of
vegetation
no
chance
unless
there
foliage
muttered
the
doctor
half
to
himself
the
builder
asked
what
he
meant
he
explained
so
far
as
we
know
all
animal
life
depends
upon
vegetation
for
its
oxygen
not
only
the
oxygen
in
the
air
but
that
stored
in
the
plants
which
animals
eat
unless
there
greenery
he
paused
at
a
low
exclamation
from
smith
the
engineer
eyes
were
fixed
in
wonder
and
excitement
upon
that
part
of
the
valley
which
lay
at
the
joint
of
the
l
below
them
it
was
perhaps
six
miles
across
and
all
over
the
comparatively
smooth
surface
jutted
dark
projections
viewed
through
the
glasses
they
had
a
regular
uniform
appearance
by
jove
ejaculated
the
doctor
almost
in
awe
he
leaned
forward
and
scrubbed
the
for
the
tenth
time
all
four
men
strained
their
eyes
to
see
it
was
the
architect
who
broke
the
silence
which
followed
the
other
three
were
content
to
let
the
thrill
of
the
thing
have
its
way
with
them
such
a
feeling
had
little
weight
with
the
expert
in
archeology
well
he
declared
jubilantly
in
his
boyish
voice
either
i
eat
my
hat
or
that
a
genuine
bona
fide
city
as
swiftly
as
an
elevator
drops
and
as
safely
the
cube
shot
straight
downward
every
second
the
landscape
narrowed
and
shrunk
leaving
the
remaining
details
larger
clearer
sharper
bit
by
bit
the
amazing
thing
below
them
resolved
itself
into
a
real
metropolis
within
five
minutes
they
were
less
than
a
mile
above
it
smith
threw
on
more
current
so
that
the
descent
stopped
and
the
cube
hung
motionless
in
space
for
another
five
minutes
the
four
men
studied
the
scene
in
nervous
silence
each
knew
that
the
others
were
looking
for
the
same
thing
some
sign
of
life
a
little
spot
of
green
or
possibly
something
in
motion
a
single
whiff
of
smoke
would
have
been
enough
to
cause
a
whoop
of
joy
but
nobody
shouted
there
was
nothing
to
shout
about
nowhere
in
all
that
locality
apparently
was
there
the
slightest
indication
that
any
save
themselves
were
alive
instead
the
most
extraordinary
city
that
man
had
ever
laid
eyes
upon
was
stretched
directly
beneath
it
was
grouped
about
what
seemed
to
be
the
of
three
great
roads
which
led
to
this
spot
from
as
many
passes
through
the
surrounding
hills
and
the
city
seemed
thus
naturally
divided
into
three
segments
of
equal
size
and
shape
and
each
with
its
own
street
system
for
they
undoubtedly
were
streets
no
metropolis
on
earth
ever
had
its
blocks
laid
out
with
such
unvarying
exactness
this
mercurian
city
contained
none
but
perfect
equilateral
triangles
and
the
streets
themselves
were
of
absolutely
uniform
width
the
buildings
however
showed
no
such
uniformity
on
the
outskirts
of
this
brilliantly
tan
mystery
the
blocks
seemed
to
contain
nothing
save
odd
heaps
of
dingy
mud
on
the
extreme
north
however
lay
five
blocks
grouped
together
whose
buildings
like
those
in
the
middle
of
the
city
were
rather
tall
and
of
the
same
dusty
white
hue
were
several
structures
especially
prominent
for
their
height
they
towered
to
such
an
extent
in
fact
that
their
upper
windows
were
easily
made
out
apparently
they
were
hundreds
of
stories
high
here
and
there
on
the
streets
could
be
seen
small
spots
colored
a
darker
buff
than
the
rest
of
that
dazzling
landscape
but
not
one
of
the
spots
was
moving
we
go
down
further
said
the
engineer
tentatively
in
a
low
tone
there
was
no
comment
he
gradually
reduced
the
repelling
current
so
that
the
resumed
its
descent
they
sank
down
until
they
were
on
a
level
with
the
top
of
one
of
those
extraordinary
the
roof
seemed
perfectly
flat
except
for
a
large
round
black
opening
in
its
center
no
one
was
in
sight
when
opposite
the
upper
row
of
windows
at
a
distance
of
perhaps
twenty
feet
smith
brought
the
car
to
a
halt
and
they
peered
in
there
were
no
panes
the
windows
opened
directly
into
a
vast
room
but
nothing
was
clearly
visible
in
the
blackness
save
the
outlines
of
the
opening
in
the
opposite
walls
they
went
down
further
keeping
well
to
the
middle
of
the
space
above
the
street
at
every
other
yard
they
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
inhabitants
but
so
far
as
they
could
see
their
approach
was
entirely
unobserved
when
within
fifty
yards
of
the
surface
all
four
men
made
a
search
for
below
they
saw
none
there
were
no
poles
even
neither
to
their
astonishment
was
there
such
a
thing
as
a
sidewalk
the
street
stretched
unbroken
by
curbing
from
wall
to
wall
and
from
corner
to
corner
as
the
cube
settled
slowly
to
the
ground
the
adventurers
left
the
deadlight
to
use
the
windows
for
a
moment
the
view
was
obscured
by
a
swirl
of
dust
raised
by
the
spurt
of
the
current
then
this
cloud
vanished
settling
to
the
ground
with
astounding
suddenness
as
though
jerked
down
by
some
invisible
hand
directly
ahead
of
them
distant
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
lay
a
mass
of
unusual
octagonal
shape
one
end
contained
a
small
oval
opening
but
the
men
from
the
earth
looked
in
vain
for
any
creature
to
emerge
from
it
the
doctor
silently
set
to
work
with
his
apparatus
from
an
compartment
he
obtained
a
sample
of
the
ether
outside
the
car
and
with
the
aid
of
previously
arranged
chemicals
quickly
learned
the
truth
there
was
no
air
not
only
was
there
no
oxygen
the
element
upon
which
all
known
life
depends
but
there
was
no
nitrogen
no
carbon
dioxide
not
the
slightest
trace
of
water
vapor
or
of
the
other
less
known
elements
which
can
be
found
in
small
amounts
in
our
own
atmosphere
clearly
as
the
doctor
said
whatever
air
the
astronomers
had
observed
must
exist
on
the
circumference
of
the
planet
only
and
not
in
this
blasted
spot
on
the
outer
walls
of
the
cube
so
arranged
as
to
be
visible
through
the
windows
were
various
instruments
the
barometer
showed
no
pressure
the
thermometer
a
specially
devised
one
which
used
gas
instead
of
mercury
showed
a
temperature
of
six
hundred
degrees
fahrenheit
no
air
no
water
and
a
baking
heat
as
the
geologist
remarked
how
could
life
exist
there
but
the
architect
suggested
that
possibly
there
was
some
form
of
life
of
which
men
knew
nothing
which
could
exist
under
such
circumstances
they
got
out
three
of
the
suits
these
were
a
good
deal
like
those
worn
by
divers
except
that
the
outer
layer
was
made
of
aluminum
cloth
flexible
and
strong
between
it
and
the
inner
lining
was
a
layer
of
cells
into
which
the
men
now
pumped
several
pints
of
liquid
oxygen
the
terrific
cold
of
this
chemical
made
the
heavy
flannel
of
the
inner
lining
very
welcome
while
the
oxygen
itself
as
fast
as
it
evaporated
revitalized
the
air
within
the
big
faced
helmet
once
safely
locked
within
the
clumsy
suits
jackson
van
emmon
and
smith
took
their
places
within
the
vestibule
while
the
doctor
who
had
volunteered
to
stay
behind
watched
them
open
the
outer
door
with
a
hiss
all
the
air
in
the
vestibule
rushed
out
and
the
doctor
earnestly
thanked
his
stars
that
the
inner
door
had
been
built
very
strongly
the
men
stepped
out
on
to
the
ground
at
first
they
moved
with
great
care
being
uncertain
that
their
feet
were
weighted
heavily
enough
to
counteract
the
reduced
gravitation
of
the
tiny
planet
but
they
had
been
living
in
a
very
peculiar
condition
gravitationally
speaking
for
the
past
three
days
and
they
quickly
adapted
themselves
after
a
little
shifting
about
the
three
artificial
monsters
gave
their
telephone
wires
another
scrutiny
then
keeping
always
within
ten
feet
of
each
other
so
as
not
to
throw
any
strain
on
the
connections
they
strode
in
a
way
toward
the
nearest
doorway
for
a
moment
or
two
they
stood
outside
the
queer
peaked
archway
their
glimmering
suits
standing
out
oddly
in
the
blinding
sunlight
then
they
advanced
boldly
into
the
opening
in
a
flash
they
vanished
from
the
doctor
sight
and
the
inklike
blackness
of
the
opening
again
stared
at
him
from
that
dazzling
wall
iii
the
house
of
dust
the
geologist
strong
man
that
he
was
and
by
profession
an
investigator
of
the
unknown
van
emmon
took
the
lead
he
stalked
straight
ahead
into
a
vast
space
which
without
any
preliminary
hallway
filled
the
entire
triangular
block
before
their
eyes
were
accustomed
to
the
shadow
pretty
cold
murmured
the
architect
into
the
phone
transmitter
it
was
fastened
to
the
inside
of
the
helmet
directly
in
front
of
his
mouth
while
the
receiver
was
placed
beside
his
ear
all
three
stopped
short
to
adjust
each
electrical
heating
apparatus
to
do
this
they
did
not
use
their
fingers
directly
they
manipulated
ingenious
pliers
attached
to
the
ends
of
fingerless
insulated
mittens
before
they
had
finished
the
builder
who
had
been
puzzling
over
the
extraordinary
suddenness
with
which
that
cloud
of
dust
had
settled
received
an
inspiration
he
was
carrying
and
camera
with
his
pliers
he
tore
out
a
sheet
from
the
former
and
holding
book
in
one
hand
and
the
leaf
in
the
other
he
allowed
them
to
drop
at
the
same
instant
they
reached
the
ground
together
see
the
architect
repeated
the
experiment
back
home
where
air
the
paper
would
have
floated
down
it
would
have
taken
three
times
as
long
for
it
to
fall
as
the
book
smith
nodded
but
he
had
been
thinking
of
something
else
he
said
gravely
remember
what
i
told
you
it
air
that
insulates
the
earth
from
the
ether
if
there
no
air
here
he
glanced
out
into
the
pitiless
sunlight
then
i
hope
there
no
flaw
in
our
insulation
walking
in
an
electrical
bath
they
looked
around
objects
were
pretty
distinct
now
they
could
easily
see
that
the
floor
was
covered
with
what
appeared
to
be
machines
laid
out
in
orderly
fashion
here
however
as
outside
everything
was
coated
with
that
fine
dust
it
filled
every
nook
and
cranny
it
stirred
about
their
feet
with
every
step
the
geologist
led
the
way
down
a
broad
aisle
on
either
side
of
which
towered
immense
machinery
smith
was
for
stopping
to
examine
them
one
by
one
but
the
others
vetoed
the
engineer
passion
and
strode
on
toward
the
end
of
the
triangle
more
than
anything
else
they
looked
for
the
absent
population
to
show
itself
suddenly
van
emmon
stopped
short
is
it
possible
that
they
all
asleep
he
added
that
even
though
the
sun
shone
steadily
the
year
around
the
people
must
take
time
for
rest
but
smith
stirred
the
dust
with
his
foot
and
shook
his
head
i
seen
no
tracks
this
dust
has
been
lying
here
for
weeks
perhaps
months
if
the
folks
are
away
then
they
must
be
taking
a
community
vacation
at
the
end
of
the
aisle
they
reached
a
small
space
strongly
resembling
what
might
be
seen
in
any
office
on
the
earth
in
the
middle
of
it
stood
a
low
desk
for
all
the
world
like
that
of
a
prosperous
agent
except
that
it
was
about
half
a
foot
lower
there
was
no
chair
for
lack
of
a
visible
gate
in
the
railing
the
explorers
stepped
over
being
careful
not
to
touch
it
there
was
nothing
on
top
of
the
desk
save
the
usual
coat
of
dust
below
a
very
wide
space
had
been
left
for
the
legs
of
whoever
had
used
it
and
flanking
this
space
were
two
pedestals
containing
what
looked
to
be
a
multitude
of
exceedingly
small
drawers
smith
bent
and
examined
them
apparently
they
had
no
locks
and
he
unhesitatingly
reached
out
gripped
the
knob
of
one
and
pulled
noiselessly
instantaneously
the
whole
desk
crumbled
to
powder
startled
smith
stumbled
backwards
knocking
against
the
railing
next
instant
it
lay
on
the
floor
its
fragments
scarcely
distinguishable
from
what
had
already
covered
the
surface
only
a
tiny
cloud
of
dust
arose
and
in
half
a
second
this
had
settled
the
three
looked
at
each
other
significantly
clearly
the
thing
that
had
just
happened
argued
a
great
lapse
of
time
since
the
user
of
that
desk
officiated
in
that
enclosure
it
looked
as
though
smith
guess
of
weeks
perhaps
months
would
have
to
be
changed
to
years
perhaps
centuries
feel
all
right
asked
the
geologist
jackson
and
smith
made
affirmative
noises
and
again
they
stepped
out
this
time
walking
in
the
aisle
along
the
outer
wall
they
could
see
their
plainly
through
the
ovals
here
the
machinery
could
be
examined
more
closely
they
resembled
automatic
testing
scales
said
smith
such
as
is
used
in
weighing
complicated
metal
products
after
finishing
and
assembling
moreover
they
seemed
to
be
connected
the
one
to
the
other
with
a
series
of
endless
belts
which
smith
thought
indicated
automatic
production
to
all
appearances
the
apparatus
stood
just
as
it
had
been
left
when
operations
ceased
an
unguessable
length
of
time
before
smith
showed
no
desire
to
touch
the
things
now
seeing
this
the
geologist
deliberately
reached
out
and
scraped
the
dust
from
the
nearest
machine
and
to
the
vast
relief
of
all
three
no
damage
was
done
the
dust
fell
straight
to
the
floor
exposing
a
brilliantly
polished
streak
of
metal
van
emmon
made
another
tentative
brush
or
so
at
other
points
with
the
same
result
clean
untarnished
metal
lay
beneath
all
that
dust
clearly
it
was
some
alloy
whatever
it
was
it
had
successfully
resisted
the
action
of
the
elements
all
the
while
that
such
presumably
wooden
articles
as
the
desk
and
railing
had
been
steadily
rotting
emboldened
smith
clambered
up
on
the
frame
of
one
of
the
machines
he
examined
it
closely
as
to
its
cams
clutches
gearing
and
other
details
significant
enough
to
his
mechanical
training
he
noted
their
adjustments
scrutinized
the
conveying
apparatus
and
came
back
carrying
a
cylindrical
object
which
he
had
removed
from
an
automatic
chuck
this
is
what
they
were
making
he
remarked
trying
to
conceal
his
excitement
the
others
brushed
the
dust
from
the
thing
a
huge
piece
of
metal
which
would
have
been
too
much
for
their
strength
on
the
earth
instantly
they
identified
it
it
was
a
cannon
shell
again
van
emmon
led
the
way
they
took
a
reassuring
glance
out
the
window
at
the
familiar
cube
then
passed
along
the
aisle
toward
the
farther
corner
as
they
neared
it
they
saw
that
it
contained
a
small
enclosure
of
heavy
metal
scrollwork
within
which
stood
a
triangular
elevator
the
men
examined
it
as
closely
as
possible
noting
especially
the
extremely
low
stool
which
stood
upon
its
platform
the
same
unerodable
metal
seemed
to
have
been
used
throughout
the
whole
affair
after
a
careful
scrutiny
of
the
two
levers
which
appeared
to
control
the
thing
i
going
to
try
it
out
announced
smith
well
knowing
that
the
others
would
have
to
go
with
him
if
they
kept
the
telephones
intact
they
protested
that
the
thing
was
not
safe
smith
replied
that
they
had
seen
no
stairway
or
anything
corresponding
to
one
if
this
lift
is
made
of
that
alloy
admiringly
then
it
safe
but
jackson
managed
to
talk
him
out
of
it
when
they
returned
to
the
heap
of
powdered
wood
which
had
been
the
desk
smith
spied
a
long
under
a
nearby
window
there
they
found
a
very
ordinary
vise
in
which
was
clamped
a
piece
of
metal
but
for
the
dust
it
might
have
been
placed
there
ten
minutes
before
on
the
bench
lay
several
tools
some
familiar
to
the
engineer
and
some
entirely
strange
a
set
of
of
various
sizes
caught
his
eye
he
picked
them
up
and
again
experienced
the
sensation
of
having
wood
turn
to
dust
at
his
touch
the
blades
were
whole
still
searching
the
engineer
found
a
square
metal
chest
of
drawers
each
of
which
he
promptly
opened
the
contents
were
laden
with
dust
but
he
brushed
this
off
and
disclosed
a
quantity
of
exceedingly
delicate
instruments
they
were
more
like
dentists
tools
than
machinists
yet
plainly
were
intended
for
mechanical
use
one
drawer
held
what
appeared
to
be
a
roll
of
drawings
smith
did
not
want
to
touch
them
with
infinite
care
he
blew
off
the
dust
with
the
aid
of
his
oxygen
pipe
after
a
moment
or
two
the
surface
was
clear
but
it
offered
no
encouragement
it
was
the
blank
side
of
the
paper
there
was
no
help
for
it
smith
grasped
the
roll
firmly
with
his
pliers
and
next
second
gazed
upon
dust
in
the
bottom
drawer
lay
something
that
aroused
the
curiosity
of
all
three
these
were
small
reels
about
two
inches
in
diameter
and
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
each
incased
in
a
box
they
resembled
measuring
tapes
to
some
extent
except
that
the
ribbons
were
made
of
marvelously
thin
material
van
emmon
guessed
that
there
were
a
hundred
yards
in
a
roll
smith
estimated
it
at
three
hundred
they
seemed
to
be
made
of
a
metal
similar
to
that
composing
the
machines
smith
pocketed
them
all
it
was
the
builder
who
thought
to
look
under
the
bench
but
it
was
smith
who
had
brought
a
light
by
its
aid
they
discovered
a
very
small
machine
decidedly
like
a
stock
ticker
except
that
it
had
no
glass
dome
but
possessed
at
one
end
a
curious
metal
disk
about
a
foot
in
diameter
apparently
it
had
been
undergoing
repairs
it
was
impossible
to
guess
its
purpose
smith
pride
was
instantly
aroused
he
tucked
it
under
his
arm
and
was
impatient
to
get
back
to
the
cube
where
he
might
more
carefully
examine
his
find
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
it
was
when
they
were
about
to
leave
the
building
that
they
thought
to
inspect
walls
and
ceiling
not
that
anything
worth
while
was
to
be
seen
the
surfaces
seemed
perfectly
plain
and
bare
except
for
the
inevitable
dust
even
the
uppermost
corners
ten
feet
above
their
heads
showed
dust
to
the
light
of
smith
electric
torch
van
emmon
stopped
and
stared
at
the
spot
as
though
fascinated
the
others
were
ready
to
go
they
turned
and
looked
at
him
curiously
for
a
moment
or
two
he
seemed
struggling
for
breath
good
heavens
he
gasped
almost
in
a
whisper
his
face
was
white
the
other
two
leaped
toward
him
fearful
that
he
was
suffocating
but
he
pushed
them
away
roughly
we
fools
blind
blithering
idiots
that
what
we
are
he
pointed
toward
the
ceiling
with
a
hand
that
trembled
plainly
and
went
on
in
a
voice
which
he
tried
to
make
fierce
despite
the
awe
which
shook
it
look
at
that
dust
again
how
it
get
there
he
paused
while
the
others
the
thought
finally
getting
to
them
felt
a
queer
chill
striking
at
the
backs
of
their
necks
men
there
only
one
way
for
the
dust
to
settle
on
a
wall
it
got
to
have
air
to
carry
it
it
could
possibly
get
there
without
air
that
dust
settled
long
before
life
appeared
on
the
earth
even
been
there
ever
since
the
air
disappeared
from
mercury
iv
the
library
i
thought
you
never
get
back
complained
the
doctor
crossly
when
the
three
entered
they
had
been
gone
just
half
an
hour
next
moment
he
was
studying
their
faces
and
at
once
he
demanded
the
most
important
fact
they
told
him
and
before
they
had
finished
he
was
into
another
suit
he
was
all
eagerness
but
somehow
the
three
were
very
glad
to
be
inside
the
cube
again
and
firmly
insisted
upon
moving
to
another
spot
before
making
further
explorations
within
a
minute
or
two
the
cube
was
hovering
opposite
the
upper
floor
of
the
building
the
three
had
entered
and
with
only
a
foot
of
space
separating
the
window
of
the
and
the
wall
the
men
from
the
earth
inspected
the
interior
at
considerable
length
they
flashed
a
all
about
the
place
and
concluded
that
it
was
the
where
the
raw
iron
billets
were
brought
via
the
elevator
and
from
there
slid
to
the
floor
below
at
one
end
in
exactly
the
same
location
as
the
desk
smith
had
destroyed
stood
another
with
a
low
and
remarkably
broad
chair
beside
it
so
far
as
could
be
seen
there
were
neither
doors
nor
shutters
through
the
structure
to
get
all
the
light
and
air
they
could
guessed
the
doctor
perhaps
that
why
the
buildings
are
all
triangular
most
wall
surface
in
proportion
to
floor
area
that
way
a
few
hundred
feet
higher
they
began
to
look
for
prominent
buildings
only
in
forgetful
moments
did
either
of
them
scan
the
landscape
for
signs
of
life
they
knew
now
that
there
could
be
none
we
ought
to
learn
something
there
the
doctor
said
after
a
while
pointing
out
a
particularly
large
squat
irregularly
built
affair
on
the
edge
of
the
business
district
the
architect
however
was
in
favor
of
an
exceptionally
large
high
building
in
the
isolated
group
previously
noted
in
the
suburbs
but
because
it
was
nearer
they
maneuvered
first
in
the
direction
of
the
doctor
choice
the
came
to
rest
in
a
large
plaza
opposite
what
appeared
to
be
the
structure
main
entrance
from
their
window
the
explorers
saw
that
the
squat
effect
was
due
only
to
the
space
the
edifice
covered
for
it
was
an
edifice
a
full
five
stories
high
the
doctor
was
impatient
to
go
smith
was
willing
enough
to
stay
behind
he
was
already
joyously
examining
the
strange
machine
he
had
found
two
minutes
later
kinney
van
emmon
and
jackson
were
standing
before
the
portals
of
the
great
building
there
they
halted
and
no
wonder
the
entire
face
of
the
building
could
now
be
seen
to
be
covered
with
a
mass
of
carvings
for
the
most
part
they
were
statues
in
bas
relief
all
were
fantastic
in
the
extreme
but
whether
purposely
so
or
not
there
was
no
way
to
tell
certainly
any
such
work
on
the
part
of
an
earthly
artist
would
have
branded
him
either
as
insane
or
as
an
incomprehensible
genius
directly
above
the
entrance
was
a
group
which
might
have
been
labeled
the
triumph
of
the
brute
an
enormously
powerful
man
nearly
as
broad
as
he
was
tall
stood
exulting
over
his
victim
a
less
robust
figure
prostrate
under
his
feet
both
were
clad
in
armor
the
victor
face
was
distorted
into
a
savage
snarl
startlingly
hideous
by
reason
of
the
prodigious
size
of
his
head
planted
as
it
was
directly
upon
his
shoulders
for
he
had
no
neck
his
eyes
were
set
so
close
together
that
at
first
glance
they
seemed
to
be
but
one
his
nose
was
flat
and
african
in
type
while
his
mouth
devoid
of
curves
was
simply
revolting
in
its
huge
lack
of
proportion
his
chin
was
square
and
aggressive
his
forehead
strangely
enough
extremely
high
and
narrow
rather
than
low
and
broad
his
victim
lay
in
an
attitude
that
indicated
the
most
agonizing
torture
his
head
was
bent
completely
back
and
around
behind
his
shoulders
on
the
ground
lay
two
huge
affairs
almost
as
heavy
as
the
massively
muscled
men
who
had
used
them
but
the
eyes
of
the
explorers
kept
coming
back
to
the
fearsome
face
of
the
conqueror
from
the
brows
down
he
was
simply
a
huge
brutal
giant
above
his
eyes
he
was
an
intellectual
the
combination
was
absolutely
frightful
the
beast
looked
capable
of
anything
of
overcoming
any
obstacle
mental
or
physical
internal
or
external
in
order
to
assert
his
apparently
enormous
will
he
could
control
himself
or
dominate
others
with
equal
ease
and
assurance
it
ca
be
that
he
was
drawn
from
life
said
the
doctor
with
an
effort
it
was
easy
to
criticize
that
figure
lifeless
though
it
was
on
a
planet
like
this
with
such
slight
gravitation
there
is
no
need
for
such
huge
strength
the
typical
mercurian
should
be
tall
and
flimsy
in
build
rather
than
short
and
compact
but
the
geologist
differed
we
want
to
remember
that
the
earth
has
no
standard
type
think
what
a
difference
there
is
between
the
mosquito
and
the
elephant
the
snake
and
the
spider
one
would
suppose
that
they
had
been
developed
under
totally
different
planetary
conditions
instead
of
all
right
on
the
same
globe
no
i
think
this
monster
may
have
been
genuine
and
with
that
the
geologist
turned
to
examine
the
other
statuary
without
exception
it
resembled
the
central
group
all
the
figures
were
neckless
and
all
much
more
heavily
built
than
any
people
on
earth
there
were
several
female
figures
they
had
the
same
general
build
and
in
every
case
were
so
placed
as
to
enhance
the
glory
of
the
males
in
one
group
the
woman
was
offering
up
food
and
drink
to
a
resting
worker
in
another
she
was
being
carried
off
struggling
in
the
arms
of
a
fairly
warrior
kinney
led
the
way
into
the
building
as
in
the
other
structure
there
was
no
door
the
space
seemed
to
be
but
one
story
in
height
although
that
had
the
effect
of
a
cathedral
the
whole
of
the
ceiling
irregularly
arched
in
a
curious
pointed
manner
was
ornamented
with
grotesque
figures
while
the
walls
were
also
partially
formed
of
squat
statues
set
upon
huge
triangular
shafts
in
the
spaces
between
these
outlandish
pilasters
there
had
once
been
some
sort
of
decorations
a
great
many
photos
were
taken
here
as
for
the
floor
it
was
divided
in
all
directions
by
low
walls
about
five
and
a
half
feet
in
height
these
walls
separated
the
great
room
into
perhaps
a
hundred
triangular
compartments
each
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
living
room
broad
openings
about
five
feet
square
provided
free
access
from
one
compartment
to
any
other
the
men
from
the
earth
by
standing
on
tiptoes
could
see
over
and
beyond
this
system
wonder
if
these
walls
were
supposed
to
cut
off
the
view
speculated
the
doctor
i
mean
do
you
suppose
that
the
mercurians
were
such
short
people
as
that
his
question
had
to
go
unanswered
they
stepped
into
the
nearest
compartment
and
were
on
the
point
of
pronouncing
it
bare
when
jackson
with
an
exclamation
excitedly
brushed
away
some
of
the
dust
and
showed
that
the
presumably
solid
walls
were
really
chests
of
drawers
shallow
things
of
that
peculiar
metal
these
drawers
numbered
several
hundred
to
the
compartment
in
the
whole
building
there
must
have
been
millions
once
more
the
dust
was
carefully
removed
revealing
a
layer
of
those
curious
rolls
or
reels
exactly
similar
to
what
had
been
found
in
the
tool
chest
in
the
shell
works
a
careful
examination
of
the
metallic
tape
showed
nothing
whatever
to
the
naked
eye
although
the
doctor
fancied
that
he
made
out
some
strange
characters
on
the
little
boxes
themselves
his
view
was
shortly
proved
finding
drawer
after
drawer
to
contain
a
similar
display
varying
from
one
to
a
dozen
of
the
diminutive
ribbons
van
emmon
adopted
the
plan
of
gently
blowing
away
the
dust
from
the
faces
of
the
drawers
before
opening
them
this
revealed
the
fact
that
each
of
the
shallow
things
was
neatly
labeled
instantly
the
three
were
intent
upon
this
fresh
clue
the
markings
were
very
faint
and
delicate
the
slightest
touch
being
enough
to
destroy
them
to
the
untrained
eye
they
resembled
ancient
egyptian
hieroglyphics
to
the
archeologist
they
meant
that
a
system
of
ideographs
had
been
found
suddenly
jackson
straightened
up
and
looked
about
with
a
new
interest
he
went
to
one
of
the
square
doorways
and
very
carefully
removed
the
dust
from
a
small
plate
on
the
lintel
he
need
not
have
been
so
careful
engraved
in
the
solid
metal
was
a
single
character
plainly
in
the
same
language
as
the
other
ideographs
the
architect
smiled
triumphantly
into
the
inquiring
eyes
of
his
friends
i
wo
have
to
eat
my
hat
said
he
this
is
a
city
all
right
and
this
is
its
library
smith
was
still
busy
on
the
little
machine
when
they
returned
to
the
cube
he
said
that
one
part
of
it
had
disappeared
and
was
busily
engaged
in
filing
a
bit
of
steel
to
take
its
place
as
soon
as
it
was
ready
he
thought
they
could
see
what
the
apparatus
meant
the
three
had
brought
a
large
number
of
the
reels
they
were
confident
that
a
microscopic
search
of
the
ribbons
would
disclose
something
to
bear
out
jackson
theory
that
the
great
structure
was
really
a
repository
for
books
or
whatever
corresponded
with
books
on
mercury
but
the
main
thing
said
the
doctor
enthusiastically
is
to
get
over
to
the
band
i
beginning
to
have
all
sorts
of
wild
hopes
jackson
urged
that
they
first
visit
the
big
mansion
on
the
outskirts
of
this
place
he
said
he
felt
sure
somehow
that
it
would
be
worth
while
but
van
emmon
backed
up
the
doctor
and
the
architect
had
to
be
content
with
an
agreement
to
return
in
case
their
trip
was
futile
inside
of
a
few
minutes
the
cube
was
being
drawn
steadily
over
toward
the
left
or
western
edge
of
the
planet
sunlit
face
as
it
moved
all
except
smith
kept
close
watch
on
the
ground
below
they
made
out
town
after
town
as
well
as
separate
buildings
and
on
the
roads
were
to
be
seen
a
great
many
of
those
octagonal
structures
all
motionless
after
several
hundred
miles
of
this
the
surface
abruptly
sloped
toward
what
had
clearly
been
the
bed
of
an
ocean
no
sign
of
habitations
here
however
so
apparently
the
water
had
disappeared
after
the
humans
had
gone
this
ancient
sea
ended
a
short
distance
from
the
district
they
were
seeking
a
little
more
travel
brought
them
to
a
point
where
the
sun
cast
as
much
shadow
as
light
on
the
surface
it
was
here
they
descended
coming
to
rest
on
a
sunlit
knoll
which
overlooked
a
small
filled
valley
according
to
kinney
apparatus
there
was
about
the
amount
of
air
that
exists
on
the
earth
of
water
vapor
there
was
a
trace
but
all
their
search
revealed
no
human
life
not
only
that
but
there
was
no
trace
of
lower
animals
there
was
not
even
a
lizard
much
less
a
bird
and
even
the
most
of
the
sculptures
showed
no
creatures
of
the
air
only
huge
antediluvian
monsters
were
ever
depicted
they
took
a
great
many
photos
as
a
matter
of
course
also
they
investigated
some
of
the
big
octagonal
machines
in
the
streets
finding
them
to
be
similar
to
the
great
tanks
that
were
used
in
the
war
except
that
they
did
not
have
the
characteristic
caterpillar
tread
their
eight
faces
were
so
linked
together
that
the
entire
affair
could
roll
after
a
jolting
flopping
fashion
inside
were
curious
engines
and
sturdy
machines
designed
to
throw
the
they
had
seen
no
explosive
was
employed
apparently
but
centrifugal
force
generated
in
whirling
wheels
apparently
these
cars
or
chariots
were
universally
used
the
explorers
returned
to
the
cube
where
they
found
that
smith
happening
to
look
out
a
window
had
spied
a
pond
not
far
off
the
three
visited
it
and
found
on
its
banks
the
first
green
stuff
they
had
seen
a
tiny
flowerless
salt
grass
very
scarce
it
bordered
a
slimy
bluish
pool
of
absolutely
still
fluid
nobody
would
call
it
water
they
took
a
few
samples
of
it
and
went
back
and
within
a
few
minutes
the
doctor
slid
a
small
glass
slide
into
his
microscope
and
examined
the
object
with
much
satisfaction
what
he
saw
was
a
tiny
gelatinlike
globule
among
scientists
it
is
known
as
the
amoeba
it
is
the
simplest
known
form
of
life
the
single
cell
it
had
been
the
first
thing
to
live
on
that
planet
and
apparently
it
was
also
the
last
v
the
closed
door
as
they
neared
jackson
pet
mansion
each
man
paid
close
attention
to
the
intervening
blocks
for
the
most
part
these
were
simply
shapeless
ruins
heaps
of
what
had
once
been
perhaps
brick
or
stone
once
they
allowed
the
cube
to
rest
on
the
top
of
one
of
these
mounds
but
the
car
great
weight
merely
sank
it
into
the
mass
there
was
nothing
under
it
save
that
same
sandy
dust
apparently
the
locality
they
were
approaching
had
been
set
aside
as
a
very
exclusive
residence
district
for
the
elite
of
the
country
possibly
it
contained
the
homes
of
the
royalty
assuming
that
there
had
been
a
royalty
at
any
rate
the
conspicuous
structure
jackson
had
selected
was
certainly
the
home
of
the
most
important
member
of
that
colony
when
the
three
once
more
in
their
helmets
and
suits
stood
before
the
low
broad
portico
which
protected
the
entrance
to
that
edifice
the
first
thing
they
made
out
was
an
ornamental
frieze
running
across
the
face
in
the
same
bold
realistic
style
as
the
other
sculpture
there
was
depicted
a
battle
between
two
groups
of
those
half
savage
half
cultured
monstrosities
and
in
the
background
was
shown
a
glowing
orb
obviously
the
sun
see
that
exclaimed
the
doctor
the
size
of
that
sun
i
mean
compare
it
with
the
way
old
sol
looks
now
they
took
a
single
glance
at
the
great
ball
of
fire
over
their
heads
nine
times
the
size
it
always
seemed
at
home
it
contrasted
sharply
with
the
rather
small
ball
shown
in
the
carvings
understand
the
doctor
went
on
when
that
sculpture
was
made
mercury
was
little
nearer
the
sun
than
the
earth
is
now
the
builder
was
hugely
impressed
he
asked
eagerly
then
probably
the
people
became
as
highly
developed
as
we
van
emmon
nodded
approvingly
but
the
doctor
opposed
no
i
think
not
jackson
mercury
never
did
have
as
much
air
as
the
earth
and
consequently
had
much
less
oxygen
and
the
struggle
for
existence
he
went
on
watching
to
see
if
the
geologist
approved
each
point
as
he
made
it
the
struggle
for
life
is
in
the
last
analysis
a
struggle
for
oxygen
so
i
would
say
that
life
was
a
pretty
strenuous
proposition
here
while
it
lasted
perhaps
they
were
he
stopped
then
added
what
i
understand
is
how
did
it
happen
that
their
affairs
came
to
such
an
abrupt
end
and
why
do
we
see
any
er
indications
skeletons
the
architect
shuddered
next
second
though
his
face
lit
up
with
a
thought
i
remember
reading
that
electricity
will
decompose
bone
in
time
and
then
he
shuddered
again
as
his
foot
stirred
that
lifeless
impalpable
dust
was
it
possible
as
they
passed
into
the
great
house
the
first
thing
they
noted
was
the
floor
undivided
and
bare
except
for
what
had
perhaps
been
rugs
the
shape
was
the
inevitable
equilateral
triangle
and
here
with
a
certain
magnificent
disregard
for
precedent
the
builders
had
done
away
with
a
ceiling
entirely
and
instead
had
sloped
the
three
walls
up
till
they
met
in
a
single
point
a
hundred
feet
overhead
the
effect
was
massively
simple
in
one
corner
a
section
of
the
floor
was
elevated
perhaps
three
feet
above
the
rest
and
directly
back
of
this
was
a
broad
doorway
set
in
a
short
wall
the
three
advanced
at
once
toward
it
here
the
electric
torch
came
in
very
handy
it
disclosed
a
poorly
lighted
stairway
very
broad
unrailed
and
preposterously
steep
the
steps
were
each
over
three
feet
high
difference
in
gravitation
said
the
doctor
in
response
to
questioning
look
easy
enough
for
the
perhaps
they
struggled
up
the
flight
as
best
they
could
reaching
the
top
after
over
five
minutes
of
climbing
perhaps
it
was
the
reaction
from
this
exertion
at
all
events
each
felt
a
distinct
loss
of
confidence
as
after
regaining
their
wind
they
again
began
to
explore
neither
said
anything
about
it
to
the
others
but
each
noted
a
queer
sense
of
foreboding
far
more
disquieting
than
either
of
them
had
felt
when
investigating
anything
else
it
may
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
in
their
hurry
they
had
not
stopped
to
eat
the
floor
they
were
on
was
fairly
well
lighted
with
the
usual
oval
windows
the
space
was
open
except
that
it
contained
the
same
kind
of
dividing
walls
they
had
found
in
the
library
here
however
each
compartment
contained
but
one
opening
and
that
not
uniformly
placed
in
fact
as
the
three
noted
with
a
growing
uneasiness
it
was
necessary
to
pass
through
every
one
of
them
in
order
to
reach
the
corner
farthest
from
the
ladderlike
stairs
why
it
should
make
them
uneasy
neither
could
have
said
when
they
were
almost
through
the
labyrinth
van
emmon
after
standing
on
tiptoes
for
the
tenth
time
in
order
to
locate
himself
noted
something
that
had
escaped
their
attention
before
these
compartments
used
to
be
covered
over
he
said
for
some
reason
lowering
his
voice
he
pointed
out
niches
in
the
walls
such
as
undoubtedly
once
held
the
ends
of
heavy
timbers
what
was
this
place
anyhow
a
trap
unconsciously
they
lightened
their
steps
as
they
neared
the
last
compartment
they
found
as
expected
that
it
was
another
stairwell
van
emmon
turned
the
light
upon
every
corner
of
the
place
before
going
any
further
but
except
for
a
formless
heap
of
rubbish
in
one
corner
which
they
did
not
investigate
the
place
was
as
bare
as
the
rest
of
the
floor
again
they
climbed
this
time
for
a
much
shorter
distance
but
jackson
slightly
built
chap
that
he
was
needed
a
little
help
on
the
steep
stairs
they
were
not
sorry
that
they
had
reached
the
uppermost
floor
of
the
mansion
it
was
somewhat
better
lighted
than
the
floor
below
and
they
were
relieved
to
find
that
the
triangular
compartments
did
not
have
the
significant
niches
in
their
walls
their
spirits
rose
perceptibly
at
the
corner
farthest
from
the
stairs
one
of
the
walls
rose
straight
to
the
ceiling
completely
cutting
off
a
rather
large
triangle
the
three
paid
no
attention
to
the
other
compartments
but
went
straight
to
what
they
felt
sure
was
the
most
vital
spot
in
the
place
and
their
feelings
were
justified
with
a
vengeance
when
they
saw
that
the
usual
doorway
in
this
wall
was
protected
by
something
that
had
so
far
been
entirely
missing
everywhere
else
it
was
barred
by
a
heavy
door
for
several
minutes
the
doctor
the
geologist
and
the
architect
stood
before
it
neither
would
have
liked
to
admit
that
he
would
just
as
soon
leave
that
door
unopened
all
the
former
uneasiness
came
back
it
was
all
the
more
inexplicable
with
the
brilliant
sunlight
only
a
few
feet
away
that
each
should
have
felt
chilled
by
the
place
wonder
if
it
locked
remarked
van
emmon
he
pressed
against
the
barrier
half
expecting
it
to
turn
to
dust
but
evidently
it
had
been
made
of
the
alloy
it
stood
firm
and
to
all
appearances
it
was
nearly
well
said
the
doctor
suddenly
so
that
the
other
two
started
nervously
the
door
got
to
come
down
that
all
they
looked
around
there
was
no
furniture
no
loose
piece
of
material
of
any
kind
van
emmon
straightway
backed
away
from
the
door
about
six
feet
and
the
others
followed
his
example
all
together
grunted
the
geologist
and
the
three
monsters
charged
the
door
it
shook
under
the
impact
a
shower
of
dust
fell
down
and
they
saw
that
they
had
loosened
the
thing
once
more
this
time
a
wide
crack
showed
all
around
the
edge
of
the
door
and
the
third
attempt
finished
the
job
noiselessly
for
there
was
no
air
to
carry
the
sound
but
with
a
heavy
jar
which
all
three
felt
through
their
feet
the
barrier
went
flat
on
the
floor
beyond
at
the
same
instant
a
curious
invisible
wave
like
a
tiny
puff
of
wind
floated
out
of
the
darkness
and
passed
by
the
three
men
from
the
earth
each
noticed
it
but
neither
mentioned
it
at
the
time
van
emmon
was
already
searching
the
darkness
with
the
torch
apparently
it
was
only
an
anteroom
a
few
feet
beyond
was
another
wall
and
in
it
stood
another
door
larger
and
heavier
than
the
first
the
three
did
not
stop
they
immediately
tried
their
strength
on
this
one
also
after
a
half
dozen
attempts
without
so
much
as
shaking
the
massive
affair
it
no
use
panted
the
geologist
wishing
that
he
could
get
a
handkerchief
to
his
forehead
we
ca
loosen
it
without
tools
jackson
was
for
trying
again
but
the
doctor
agreed
with
van
emmon
they
reflected
that
they
had
been
away
from
smith
long
enough
anyhow
the
cube
was
out
of
sight
from
where
they
were
van
emmon
turned
the
light
on
the
walls
of
the
anteroom
and
found
on
a
shelf
at
one
end
a
neat
pile
of
those
little
reels
eleven
in
all
he
pocketed
the
lot
there
was
nothing
else
jackson
and
kinney
started
to
go
they
retreated
as
far
into
the
main
room
as
their
telephone
wires
would
allow
still
the
geologist
held
back
come
on
said
the
doctor
uneasily
it
getting
cold
next
second
they
stopped
short
nerves
on
edge
at
a
strange
exclamation
from
van
emmon
they
looked
around
to
see
him
pointing
his
light
directly
at
the
floor
even
in
that
unnatural
suit
of
mail
his
attitude
was
one
of
horror
look
here
he
said
in
a
low
strained
voice
they
went
to
his
side
and
instinctively
glanced
behind
them
before
looking
at
what
lay
in
the
dust
it
was
the
imprint
of
an
enormous
human
foot
the
first
thing
that
greeted
the
ears
of
the
explorers
upon
taking
off
their
suits
in
the
was
the
exultant
voice
of
smith
he
was
too
excited
to
notice
anything
out
of
the
way
in
their
manner
he
was
almost
dancing
in
front
of
his
bench
where
the
unknown
machine
now
reconstructed
stood
belted
to
a
small
it
runs
he
was
shouting
you
got
here
just
in
time
he
began
to
fumble
with
a
switch
what
of
it
remarked
the
doctor
in
the
bland
tone
which
he
kept
for
occasions
when
smith
needed
calming
what
will
it
do
if
it
does
run
the
engineer
looked
blank
why
then
he
remembered
and
picked
up
one
of
the
reels
at
random
there
a
clamp
here
just
the
right
size
to
hold
one
of
these
he
explained
fitting
the
ribbon
into
place
and
threading
its
free
end
into
a
loop
on
a
spool
which
looked
as
though
made
for
it
but
his
excitement
had
passed
he
now
cautiously
set
a
small
anvil
between
himself
and
the
apparatus
and
then
with
the
aid
of
a
long
stick
he
threw
on
the
current
for
a
moment
nothing
happened
save
the
hum
of
the
motor
then
a
strange
leafy
rustling
sounded
from
the
mechanism
and
next
without
any
warning
a
voice
nasal
and
plaintive
but
distinctly
human
spoke
from
the
big
metal
disk
the
words
were
unintelligible
the
language
was
totally
unlike
anything
ever
heard
on
the
earth
and
yet
deliberately
if
somewhat
cringingly
the
voice
proceeded
with
what
was
apparently
a
recitation
there
were
modulations
pauses
sentences
but
seemingly
the
paragraphs
were
all
short
and
to
the
point
as
the
thing
went
on
the
four
men
came
closer
and
watched
the
operation
of
the
machine
the
ribbon
unrolled
slowly
it
was
plain
that
if
the
one
topic
occupied
the
whole
reel
then
it
must
have
the
length
of
an
ordinary
chapter
and
as
the
voice
continued
certain
dramatic
qualities
came
out
and
governed
the
words
utterly
incomprehensible
though
they
were
there
was
a
real
thrill
to
it
after
a
while
they
stopped
the
thing
no
use
listening
to
this
now
as
the
doctor
said
we
got
to
learn
a
good
deal
more
about
these
people
before
we
can
guess
what
it
all
means
and
yet
although
all
were
very
hungry
on
jackson
suggestion
they
tried
out
one
of
the
records
that
was
brought
from
that
baffling
anteroom
smith
was
very
much
interested
in
that
unopened
door
and
van
emmon
was
in
the
midst
of
it
when
jackson
started
the
motor
the
geologist
words
stuck
in
his
throat
the
disk
was
actually
shaking
with
the
vibrations
of
a
most
terrific
voice
prodigiously
loud
and
powerful
its
booming
resonant
bass
smote
the
ears
like
the
roll
of
thunder
it
was
irresistible
in
its
force
compelling
in
its
assurance
masterful
and
strong
to
an
overpowering
degree
involuntarily
the
men
from
the
earth
stepped
back
on
it
roared
and
rumbled
speaking
the
same
language
as
that
of
the
other
record
but
whereas
the
first
speaker
merely
used
the
words
the
last
speaker
demolished
them
one
felt
that
he
had
extracted
every
ounce
of
power
in
the
language
leaving
it
weak
and
flabby
unfit
for
further
use
he
threw
out
his
sentences
as
though
done
with
them
not
boldly
not
defiantly
least
of
all
tentatively
he
spoke
with
a
certainty
and
force
that
came
from
a
knowledge
that
he
could
compel
rather
than
induce
his
hearers
to
believe
it
took
a
little
nerve
to
shut
him
off
van
emmon
was
the
one
who
did
it
somehow
they
all
felt
immensely
relieved
when
the
gigantic
voice
was
silenced
and
at
once
began
discussing
the
thing
with
great
earnestness
jackson
was
for
assuming
that
the
first
record
was
worn
and
old
the
last
one
fresh
and
new
but
after
examining
both
tapes
under
a
glass
and
seeing
how
equally
clear
cut
and
sharp
the
impressions
all
were
they
agreed
that
the
extraordinary
voice
they
had
heard
was
practically
true
to
life
they
tried
out
the
rest
of
the
records
in
that
batch
finding
that
they
were
all
by
the
same
speaker
nowhere
among
the
ribbons
brought
from
the
library
was
another
of
his
making
although
a
great
number
of
different
voices
was
included
neither
was
there
another
talker
with
a
fifth
the
volume
the
resonance
the
absolute
power
of
conviction
that
this
unknown
colossus
possessed
of
course
this
is
no
place
to
describe
the
laborious
process
of
interpreting
these
documents
records
of
a
past
which
was
gone
before
earth
mankind
had
even
begun
the
work
involved
the
study
of
countless
photos
covering
everything
from
inscriptions
to
parts
of
machinery
and
other
details
which
furnished
clue
after
clue
to
that
superancient
language
it
was
not
deciphered
in
fact
until
several
years
after
the
explorers
had
submitted
their
finds
to
the
world
foremost
lexicographers
antiquarians
and
paleontologists
even
today
some
of
it
is
disputed
but
right
here
is
most
emphatically
the
place
to
insert
the
tale
told
by
that
unparalleled
voice
and
incredible
though
it
may
seem
as
judged
by
the
standards
of
the
peoples
of
this
earth
the
account
is
fairly
proved
by
the
facts
uncovered
by
the
expedition
it
would
be
but
begging
the
question
to
doubt
the
genuineness
of
the
thing
and
if
understanding
the
language
one
were
to
hear
the
original
as
it
fell
word
for
word
from
the
iron
mouth
of
strokor
footnote
note
in
the
mercurian
language
stroke
means
iron
or
heart
the
one
would
believe
none
could
doubt
nor
would
and
so
it
does
not
do
him
justice
to
set
it
down
in
ordinary
print
one
must
imagine
the
story
being
related
by
stentor
himself
must
conceive
of
each
word
falling
like
the
blow
of
a
mammoth
sledge
the
tale
was
not
told
it
was
bellowed
and
this
is
how
it
ran
part
ii
the
story
i
the
man
i
am
strokor
son
of
strok
the
armorer
i
am
strokor
a
maker
of
tools
of
war
strokor
the
mightiest
man
in
the
world
strokor
whose
wisdom
outwitted
the
hordes
of
klow
strokor
who
has
never
feared
and
never
failed
let
him
who
dares
dispute
it
i
i
am
strokor
in
my
youth
i
was
as
now
the
marvel
of
all
who
saw
i
was
ever
robust
and
daring
and
naught
but
much
older
bigger
lads
could
outdo
me
i
balked
at
nothing
be
it
a
game
or
a
battle
it
was
and
forever
shall
be
my
chief
delight
to
best
all
others
was
from
my
mother
that
i
gained
my
huge
frame
and
sound
heart
in
truth
i
am
very
like
her
now
that
i
think
upon
it
she
too
was
indomitable
in
battle
and
famed
for
her
liking
for
strife
no
doubt
her
stalwart
figure
that
caught
my
father
fancy
aye
my
mother
was
a
very
likely
woman
but
she
boasted
no
brains
i
need
no
cunning
i
remember
she
said
and
he
who
was
so
unlucky
in
battle
as
to
fall
into
her
hands
could
vouch
for
the
truth
of
it
as
long
as
he
lived
which
would
not
be
long
she
was
a
grand
woman
slow
to
anger
and
a
match
for
many
a
good
pair
of
men
often
as
a
lad
have
i
carried
the
marks
of
her
punishment
for
the
most
of
a
year
and
thus
it
seems
that
i
owe
my
head
to
my
father
he
was
a
marvelously
clever
man
dexterous
with
hand
and
brain
alike
moreover
he
was
no
weakling
perchance
i
should
credit
him
with
some
of
my
agility
for
he
was
famed
as
a
gymnast
though
not
a
powerful
one
was
he
who
taught
me
how
to
disable
my
enemy
with
a
mere
clutch
of
the
neck
at
a
certain
spot
but
strok
the
armorer
was
feared
most
because
of
his
brain
and
his
knack
of
using
his
mind
to
the
undoing
of
others
and
he
taught
me
all
that
he
knew
taught
me
all
that
he
had
learned
in
a
lifetime
of
fighting
for
the
emperor
of
mending
the
complicated
machines
in
the
armory
of
contact
with
the
chemists
who
wrought
the
secret
alloy
and
the
chiefs
who
led
the
army
some
of
this
he
taught
me
when
i
was
not
yet
a
man
why
he
should
have
done
so
i
know
not
save
that
he
seemed
to
value
my
affection
and
liked
not
my
mother
demands
that
i
heed
her
call
not
his
at
all
events
i
oft
found
his
shop
a
place
of
refuge
from
her
wrath
and
i
early
came
to
value
his
teachings
when
i
became
a
man
he
abruptly
ended
the
practice
i
think
he
saw
that
i
was
become
as
dexterous
as
he
with
the
tools
of
the
craft
and
he
feared
lest
i
know
more
than
he
well
he
might
the
day
i
realized
this
i
laughed
long
and
loud
and
from
that
time
forth
he
taught
me
not
because
he
chose
to
but
because
i
bent
a
chisel
in
my
bare
hands
before
his
eyes
and
told
him
his
place
many
times
he
strove
to
trick
me
and
more
than
once
he
all
but
caught
me
in
some
trap
he
was
a
crafty
man
and
relied
not
upon
brawn
but
upon
wits
yet
i
was
ever
on
the
watch
and
i
but
learned
the
more
from
him
ye
are
very
kind
i
mocked
him
one
morning
when
i
had
taken
my
seat
a
huge
weight
had
dropped
from
above
and
crushed
my
stool
to
splinters
much
as
it
would
have
crushed
my
skull
had
i
not
leaped
instantly
aside
ye
are
kinder
than
most
fathers
who
teach
their
sons
nothing
at
all
he
foamed
at
his
mouth
in
his
rage
and
discomfiture
insolent
whelp
he
snarled
thou
art
quick
as
a
cat
on
thy
feet
but
i
was
not
to
be
appeased
by
words
i
smote
him
on
the
chest
with
my
bare
hand
so
that
he
fell
on
the
far
side
of
the
room
let
that
be
a
warning
i
told
him
when
he
had
recovered
some
time
later
if
ye
have
any
more
tricks
try
them
for
not
on
me
which
i
claim
to
be
a
neat
twist
of
words
it
was
not
long
after
that
when
i
saw
a
change
in
my
father
he
no
longer
tried
to
snare
me
instead
he
began
of
his
own
free
will
to
train
my
mind
to
other
than
warlike
things
at
first
i
was
suspicious
enough
i
looked
for
new
traps
and
watched
all
the
closer
i
told
him
that
his
next
try
would
surely
be
his
last
and
i
meant
it
but
the
time
came
when
i
saw
that
my
father
was
reconciled
to
his
master
i
saw
that
he
genuinely
admitted
my
prowess
and
where
he
formerly
envied
me
he
now
took
great
pride
in
all
i
accomplished
and
claimed
that
it
was
but
his
own
brains
acting
through
my
body
i
let
him
indulge
in
the
conceit
i
grudged
it
not
to
him
so
long
as
he
taught
me
in
truth
he
was
so
eager
to
add
to
my
store
of
facts
so
intent
upon
filling
my
head
with
what
filled
his
that
at
times
i
was
fairly
compelled
to
stop
him
lest
i
tire
my
mother
opposed
all
this
the
lad
needs
none
of
thy
wiles
she
gibed
he
is
no
stripling
he
is
a
man
man
and
a
fit
son
of
his
mother
aye
quoth
my
father
slyly
he
has
thy
muscle
and
thy
courage
thank
jon
he
hath
not
thy
empty
head
whereat
she
flew
at
him
had
she
caught
him
she
would
have
destroyed
him
such
was
her
rage
and
afterwards
she
would
have
mourned
her
folly
and
mayhap
have
injured
herself
for
she
loved
him
greatly
but
he
stepped
aside
just
in
the
nick
of
time
and
she
crashed
into
the
wall
behind
him
with
such
force
that
she
was
senseless
for
a
time
i
remember
it
well
and
yet
to
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
i
must
admit
that
i
owe
a
great
deal
to
that
maka
the
but
for
him
perchance
the
name
of
strokor
would
mean
but
little
for
was
he
who
gave
me
ambition
truly
it
was
an
uncommon
affair
my
first
meeting
with
him
now
that
i
shake
my
memory
for
it
it
seems
that
something
else
of
like
consequence
came
to
pass
on
the
same
occasion
curious
but
i
have
not
thought
on
it
for
many
days
yes
it
is
true
i
met
maka
on
the
very
morn
that
i
first
laid
eyes
on
the
girl
ave
i
was
returning
from
the
northland
at
the
time
a
rumor
had
come
down
to
vlama
that
one
of
the
people
in
the
snow
country
had
seen
a
lone
specimen
of
the
mulikka
now
these
were
but
a
myth
no
man
living
remembers
when
the
carvings
on
the
house
of
learning
were
made
and
all
the
wise
men
say
that
it
hath
been
ages
since
any
being
other
than
man
roamed
the
world
yet
i
was
young
i
determined
to
search
for
the
thing
anyhow
and
was
only
after
wasting
many
days
in
the
snow
that
i
cursed
my
luck
and
turned
back
i
was
afoot
for
the
going
was
too
rough
for
my
chariot
i
had
not
yet
quit
the
wilderness
before
from
a
height
i
spied
a
group
of
people
ascending
from
the
valley
knowing
not
whether
they
be
friends
or
foes
i
hid
beside
the
path
up
which
they
must
come
for
i
was
weary
and
wanting
no
strife
yet
i
became
alert
enough
when
the
three
they
were
two
one
old
one
young
and
a
girl
came
within
earshot
for
they
were
quarreling
it
seemed
that
the
young
man
who
was
plainly
eager
to
gain
the
girl
had
fouled
in
a
try
to
force
her
favor
the
older
man
chided
him
hotly
and
just
when
they
came
opposite
my
rock
the
younger
man
whose
passion
had
got
the
better
of
him
suddenly
tripped
the
older
so
that
he
fell
upon
the
ledge
and
would
have
fallen
to
his
death
on
the
rocks
below
had
not
the
girl
crying
out
in
her
terror
leaped
forward
and
caught
his
hand
at
once
the
took
the
lass
about
the
waist
and
strove
to
pull
her
away
for
a
moment
she
held
fast
and
in
that
moment
i
strokor
stood
forth
from
behind
the
rock
now
be
it
known
that
i
am
no
champion
of
weaklings
i
have
no
liking
for
the
troubles
of
others
enough
of
my
own
say
i
was
but
angered
that
the
should
have
done
the
trick
so
clumsily
and
upon
an
old
man
at
that
i
cared
not
for
the
gray
beard
nor
what
became
of
the
chit
i
clapped
the
trickster
upon
the
shoulder
and
spun
him
about
ye
clumsy
coward
i
jeered
have
ye
had
no
practice
that
ye
should
trip
the
old
one
no
better
than
that
who
are
ye
he
stuttered
like
the
coward
he
was
i
laughed
and
helped
the
chit
drag
maka
for
it
was
he
up
to
safety
i
am
a
far
better
man
than
ye
i
said
not
caring
to
give
my
name
and
i
can
show
ye
how
the
thing
should
be
done
come
at
me
if
ye
are
a
man
at
that
he
dashed
upon
me
and
such
was
his
fear
of
ridicule
for
the
girl
was
laughing
him
to
scorn
now
he
put
up
a
fair
stiff
fight
but
i
forgot
my
weariness
when
he
foully
clotted
me
on
the
head
with
a
stone
i
drove
at
him
with
all
the
speed
and
suddenness
my
father
had
taught
me
caught
the
fellow
by
the
ankle
and
brought
him
down
atop
me
the
rest
was
easy
i
bent
my
knee
under
his
middle
and
tossed
him
high
in
a
flash
i
was
upon
my
feet
and
caught
him
from
behind
and
in
another
second
i
had
rushed
him
to
the
cliff
and
when
he
turned
to
save
himself
i
tripped
him
as
neatly
as
father
himself
could
have
done
it
so
that
the
fellow
will
guard
the
ditch
no
more
save
in
the
caverns
of
hofe
i
laughed
and
picked
up
my
pack
my
head
hurt
a
bit
from
the
blow
but
a
little
water
would
do
for
that
i
started
to
go
ye
are
a
brave
man
cried
the
girl
i
turned
carelessly
and
then
quite
for
the
first
time
i
had
a
real
look
at
her
she
was
in
no
way
like
any
woman
i
had
seen
all
of
them
had
been
much
like
the
men
brawny
and
as
well
fitted
for
their
work
as
are
men
for
war
but
this
chit
was
all
but
slender
not
skinny
but
prettily
rounded
out
and
soft
like
i
can
not
say
that
i
admired
her
at
first
glance
she
seemed
fit
only
to
look
at
not
to
live
i
was
minded
of
some
of
the
ancient
carvings
which
show
delicate
lightly
built
animals
that
have
long
since
been
killed
off
graceful
trifles
that
rested
the
eye
as
for
the
old
man
aye
thou
art
brave
and
wondrous
strong
my
lad
said
he
still
a
bit
shaky
from
his
close
call
i
was
pleased
with
the
acknowledgment
and
turned
back
it
was
nothing
i
told
them
and
i
recounted
some
of
my
exploits
notably
one
in
which
i
routed
a
raiding
party
of
men
from
klow
six
in
all
carrying
in
two
alive
on
my
shoulders
i
am
the
son
of
strok
the
armorer
ye
are
strokor
marveled
the
girl
staring
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
god
then
she
threw
back
her
head
and
stepped
close
i
am
ave
this
is
maka
he
is
my
uncle
but
best
known
as
a
my
father
was
durok
the
she
watched
my
face
durok
i
knew
him
well
my
father
had
said
that
he
was
quite
as
brainy
as
himself
he
were
a
fine
man
aye
said
she
proudly
she
stepped
closer
i
could
not
but
see
how
like
him
she
was
though
a
woman
and
next
second
she
laid
a
hand
on
my
arm
i
am
yet
a
free
woman
strokor
hast
thou
picked
thy
mate
and
her
cheeks
flamed
now
was
not
my
first
experience
of
the
kind
many
women
had
looked
like
that
at
me
before
but
i
had
always
been
a
man
man
and
had
ever
heeded
my
father
warning
to
have
naught
whatever
to
do
with
women
they
are
the
worst
trick
of
all
he
told
me
and
i
had
never
forgot
belike
i
owe
much
of
my
power
to
just
this
but
ave
had
acted
too
quickly
for
me
to
get
away
i
laughed
again
and
shook
her
off
i
will
have
naught
to
do
with
ye
i
told
her
civilly
enough
when
i
am
ready
to
take
a
woman
i
shall
take
her
not
before
at
that
the
blood
left
her
face
she
stood
very
straight
and
her
eyes
flashed
dangerously
were
she
a
man
i
should
have
stood
on
my
guard
but
she
made
no
move
only
the
softness
in
her
eyes
gave
way
to
such
a
savage
look
that
i
was
filled
with
amaze
and
thus
i
left
them
the
old
man
calling
down
the
blessing
of
jon
upon
me
for
having
saved
his
life
and
the
chit
glaring
after
me
as
though
no
curses
would
suffice
a
right
queer
matter
i
thought
at
the
time
i
guessed
not
what
would
come
of
it
not
then
ii
the
vision
a
fortnight
later
more
or
less
when
next
i
saw
maka
i
was
lumbering
along
in
my
chariot
feeling
most
uncomfortable
under
the
eyes
of
my
friends
for
one
foot
of
my
machine
had
a
loose
link
and
was
flapping
absurdly
and
i
liked
it
none
too
well
when
maka
stopped
his
own
rattletrap
in
front
of
mine
and
came
running
to
my
window
next
moment
i
forgot
his
impertinence
strokor
he
whispered
his
face
alive
with
excitement
thou
art
a
brave
lad
and
didst
save
my
life
now
know
you
that
a
party
of
the
men
of
klow
have
secreted
themselves
under
the
stairway
behind
the
throne
they
have
killed
the
guards
and
will
of
a
certainty
kill
the
emperor
too
serve
the
dolt
right
i
replied
for
i
really
cared
but
little
but
why
have
ye
come
to
me
old
man
i
am
but
a
lieutenant
in
the
armory
i
am
not
the
captain
of
the
palace
guard
because
he
answered
gazing
at
me
very
pleasingly
thou
couldst
dispose
of
the
whole
party
single
handed
there
are
but
four
and
gain
much
glory
for
thyself
by
jon
i
swore
vastly
delighted
and
without
stopping
to
ask
maka
whence
he
had
got
his
knowledge
i
went
at
once
to
the
spot
however
when
i
got
back
i
sought
the
i
ought
to
mention
that
i
had
no
trouble
with
the
louts
and
that
the
emperor
himself
saw
me
finishing
off
the
last
of
them
i
sought
the
and
demanded
how
he
had
known
hast
ever
heard
of
edam
he
inquired
in
return
edam
i
had
not
the
name
was
strange
to
me
who
is
he
a
man
as
young
as
thyself
but
a
mere
stripling
quoth
maka
he
was
a
pupil
of
mine
when
i
taught
in
the
house
of
learning
of
late
he
has
turned
to
prophecy
and
it
is
fair
remarkable
how
well
the
lad
doth
guess
at
all
events
was
he
strokor
who
told
me
of
the
plot
he
saw
it
in
a
dream
then
edam
must
yet
be
in
vlama
said
i
if
he
were
able
to
tell
ye
canst
bring
him
to
me
i
would
know
him
and
so
it
came
about
that
on
the
eve
of
that
same
day
maka
brought
edam
to
my
house
i
remember
it
well
for
was
the
same
day
that
the
emperor
in
gratitude
of
my
little
service
in
the
anteroom
had
relieved
me
from
my
post
in
the
armory
and
made
me
captain
of
the
palace
guard
i
was
thus
become
the
youngest
captain
also
the
biggest
and
strongest
and
as
will
soon
appear
by
far
the
i
was
in
high
good
humor
and
had
decided
to
celebrate
with
a
feast
so
when
my
two
callers
arrived
i
sat
them
down
before
a
meal
such
as
cost
a
tenth
footnote
since
mercury
had
no
moon
its
people
never
coined
a
word
to
correspond
with
our
month
and
for
the
same
reason
they
never
had
a
week
their
time
was
reckoned
only
in
days
years
and
fractions
of
the
two
of
my
year
salary
i
served
not
only
the
usual
products
of
the
field
variously
prepared
but
as
a
special
gift
from
the
emperor
own
stock
a
piece
of
mulikka
meat
frozen
which
had
been
found
in
the
northland
by
some
geologists
a
few
years
aback
it
had
been
kept
in
the
palace
all
this
time
and
was
in
prime
condition
maka
and
i
enjoyed
it
overmuch
but
edam
would
touch
it
not
he
was
a
slightly
built
lad
not
at
all
the
sturdy
man
that
i
am
but
of
less
than
half
the
weight
his
head
too
was
unlike
mine
his
forehead
was
wide
as
well
as
tall
and
his
eyes
were
mild
as
a
slave
ye
are
very
young
to
be
a
prophet
i
said
to
him
after
we
were
filled
and
the
slaves
had
cleared
away
our
litter
tell
me
hast
foretold
anything
else
that
has
come
to
pass
aye
he
replied
not
at
all
boldly
but
what
some
call
modestly
i
prophesied
the
armistice
which
now
stands
between
our
empire
and
klow
is
this
true
i
demanded
of
maka
the
old
man
bowed
his
head
gravely
and
looked
upon
the
young
man
with
far
more
respect
than
i
felt
he
added
tell
strokor
the
dream
thou
hadst
two
nights
ago
edam
it
were
a
right
strange
thing
whether
true
or
no
the
stripling
shifted
his
weight
on
his
stool
and
moved
the
bowl
closer
then
he
thrust
his
pipe
deep
into
it
and
let
the
liquid
flow
slowly
out
his
nostrils
footnote
a
curious
custom
among
the
mercurians
who
had
no
tobacco
there
is
no
other
way
to
explain
some
of
the
carvings
doubtless
the
liquid
was
and
perhaps
slightly
narcotic
i
saw
this
he
began
immediately
before
rising
and
after
a
very
light
supper
so
i
know
that
it
was
a
vision
from
jon
and
not
of
my
own
making
i
was
standing
upon
the
summit
of
a
mountain
and
gazing
down
upon
a
very
large
fertile
valley
it
was
heavily
wooded
dark
green
and
inviting
but
what
first
drew
my
attention
was
a
great
number
of
animals
moving
about
in
the
air
they
were
passing
strange
affairs
some
large
some
small
variously
colored
and
all
covered
with
the
same
sort
of
fur
quite
unlike

have
ever
seen
in
the
air
i
echoed
recovering
from
my
astonishment
then
i
laughed
mightily
man
ye
must
be
crazy
there
is
no
animal
can
live
in
the
air
ye
must
mean
in
the
water
or
on
land
nay
interposed
the
thou
hast
never
studied
the
stars
strokor
or
thou
wouldst
know
that
there
be
a
number
of
them
which
through
the
enlarging
tube
show
themselves
to
be
round
worlds
like
unto
our
own
and
it
doth
further
appear
that
these
other
worlds
also
have
air
like
this
we
breathe
and
that
some
have
less
while
others
have
even
more
from
what
edam
has
told
me
finished
the
old
man
i
judge
that
his
vision
took
place
on
jeos
footnote
the
mercurian
word
for
earth
a
world
much
larger
than
ours
according
to
my
calculations
and
doubtless
having
enough
air
to
permit
very
light
creatures
to
move
about
in
it
go
on
said
i
to
edam
i
be
ever
willing
to
believe
anything
strange
when
my
stomach
is
full
the
dreamer
had
taken
no
offense
then
i
bent
my
gaze
closer
as
i
am
always
able
in
visions
and
i
saw
that
the
greenery
was
most
remarkably
dense
tangled
and
luxuriant
to
a
degree
not
ever
seen
here
and
moving
about
in
it
was
the
most
extraordinary
collection
of
beings
that
i
have
ever
laid
these
eyes
upon
there
were
some
huge
creatures
quite
as
tall
as
thy
house
strokor
with
legs
as
big
around
as
that
huge
chest
of
thine
they
had
tails
as
had
our
ancient
mulikka
save
that
these
were
terrific
things
as
long
and
as
big
as
the
trunk
of
a
large
tree
i
know
not
their
names
footnote
probably
the
dinosaur
and
then
at
the
other
extreme
was
a
tiny
creature
of
the
air
which
moved
with
a
musical
hum
it
could
have
hid
under
thy
strokor
yet
it
had
a
tiny
bill
with
which
it
stung
most
aggravatingly
and
between
these
two
there
were
any
number
of
creatures
of
varying
size
and
shape
but
nowhere
was
there
a
sign
of
a
man
true
there
was
one
hairy
grotesque
creature
which
hung
by
its
hands
and
feet
from
the
very
like
thee
in
some
way
strokor
but
its
face
and
head
were
those
of
a
brainless
beast
not
of
a
man
nowhere
was
a
creature
like
me
or
thee
and
the
most
curious
thing
was
this
although
there
were
ten
times
as
many
of
these
creatures
big
and
little
to
the
same
space
as
on
our
world
yet
there
was
no
great
amount
of
strife
in
truth
there
is
far
more
combat
and
destruction
among
we
men
than
among
the
beasts
and
he
spoke
most
earnestly
as
though
he
would
not
care
to
be
disbelieved
i
saw
fathers
fight
to
protect
their
young
i
near
fell
from
my
stool
in
my
amaze
never
in
all
my
life
had
i
heard
a
thing
so
far
from
the
fact
what
i
shouted
ye
sit
there
like
a
sane
man
and
tell
me
ye
saw
fathers
fight
for
their
young
he
nodded
his
head
still
very
gravely
i
fell
silent
for
want
of
words
but
maka
put
in
a
thought
it
would
appear
strokor
that
it
be
not
so
much
of
an
effort
for
beings
to
live
there
on
jeos
as
here
perchance
the
greater
amount
of
vegetation
at
all
accounts
the
animals
need
not
prey
upon
one
another
so
generally
and
that
then
would
explain
why
some
have
energy
enough
to
waste
in
the
care
of
their
young
i
can
understand
i
said
very
slowly
i
can
understand
why
a
mother
will
fight
for
her
babes
is
reasonable
enough
no
doubt
but
as
for
fathers
doing
the
same
edam
dost
mean
to
say
that
all
creatures
on
jeos
do
this
nay
only
some
it
may
be
that
fewer
than
half
of
the
varieties
have
the
custom
howbeit
is
a
beautiful
one
when
the
vision
ended
i
was
right
loath
to
go
faugh
i
spat
upon
the
ground
such
softness
makes
me
ill
i
be
glad
i
were
born
in
a
man
world
where
i
can
take
a
man
chances
i
want
no
favoring
if
i
am
strong
enough
to
live
i
live
if
not
i
die
what
more
can
i
ask
aye
my
lad
said
maka
approvingly
this
be
a
world
for
the
strong
there
is
no
room
here
for
others
there
is
scarce
enough
food
for
those
who
thanks
to
their
strength
do
survive
he
slipped
the
gold
band
from
off
his
wrist
and
held
it
up
for
jon
to
see
here
strokor
a
pledge
a
pledge
to
the
survival
of
the
fittest
a
neat
neat
wording
i
roared
as
i
took
the
pledge
with
him
then
we
both
stopped
short
edam
had
not
joined
us
edam
my
lad
spake
the
old
man
ye
will
take
the
pledge
with
us
the
stripling
eyes
were
troubled
well
he
knew
that
once
he
refused
such
an
act
he
were
no
longer
welcome
in
my
house
nor
in
maka
but
when
he
looked
around
it
were
bravely
enough
men
i
have
neither
the
strength
of
the
one
nor
the
brains
of
the
other
of
ye
i
am
but
a
watchmaker
i
live
because
of
my
skill
with
the
little
wheels
i
have
no
quarrel
with
either
of
ye
he
got
to
his
feet
and
started
to
the
door
but
i
can
not
take
the
pledge
with
ye
i
have
seen
a
wondrous
thing
and
i
love
it
and
though
i
know
not
why
i
feel
that
jon
has
willed
it
for
jeos
to
see
a
new
race
of
men
a
race
even
better
than
ours
i
leaped
to
my
feet
better
than
ours
mean
ye
to
say
stripling
that
there
can
be
a
better
man
than
strokor
i
full
expected
him
to
shrink
from
me
in
fear
i
was
able
to
crush
him
with
one
blow
but
he
stood
his
ground
nay
stepped
forward
and
laid
a
hand
easily
upon
my
shoulder
strokor
ye
are
more
than
a
man
ye
are
two
men
in
one
there
is
no
finer
i
say
it
fair
and
yet
i
doubt
not
that
there
can
be
and
will
be
a
better
and
with
that
such
a
curious
expression
came
into
his
face
such
a
glow
of
some
strange
land
of
warmth
that
i
let
my
hand
drop
and
suffered
him
to
depart
in
peace
such
was
my
wonder
besides
any
miserable
lout
could
have
destroyed
the
lad
maka
sat
deep
in
thought
for
a
time
and
when
he
did
speak
he
made
no
mention
of
the
lad
who
had
just
quit
us
instead
he
looked
me
over
long
and
earnestly
and
at
the
end
he
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
and
sighed
thou
art
the
sort
of
a
son
i
would
have
had
strokor
given
the
wits
of
thy
father
to
hold
a
woman
like
thy
mother
and
thou
didst
save
my
life
he
mused
a
little
longer
then
roused
himself
and
spake
sharply
thou
art
a
vain
man
strokor
aye
i
agreed
willingly
enough
and
none
has
better
cause
than
i
he
would
not
acknowledge
the
quip
thou
hast
everything
needful
to
tickle
thy
vanity
thou
hast
the
envy
of
those
who
note
thy
strength
the
praise
of
them
who
love
thy
courage
and
the
respect
of
they
who
value
thy
brains
all
these
thou
hast
and
yet
ye
have
not
that
which
is
best
i
thought
swiftly
and
turned
on
him
with
a
frown
mean
ye
that
i
am
not
handsome
enough
nay
strokor
quoth
the
there
be
none
handsomer
in
this
world
no
matter
what
the
standard
of
any
other
such
as
edam
jeos
it
is
not
that
it
is
that
thou
hast
no
ambition
i
considered
this
deeply
at
first
thought
it
was
not
true
had
i
not
always
made
it
a
point
to
best
my
opponent
from
my
youth
it
had
been
ever
my
custom
to
succeed
where
bigger
bodies
and
older
minds
had
failed
was
not
this
ambition
but
before
i
disputed
the
point
with
maka
i
saw
what
he
meant
i
had
no
final
ambition
no
ultimate
goal
for
which
to
strive
i
had
been
content
from
year
to
year
to
outdo
each
rival
as
he
came
before
me
and
now
with
mind
and
body
alike
in
the
pink
of
condition
i
was
come
to
the
place
where
none
durst
stand
before
me
ye
are
right
maka
i
admitted
not
because
i
cared
to
gratify
his
conceit
but
because
it
were
always
for
my
own
good
to
own
up
when
wrong
that
i
might
learn
the
better
ye
are
right
i
need
to
decide
upon
a
what
have
ye
thought
the
old
man
was
greatly
pleased
our
talk
with
edam
brought
it
all
before
me
know
you
strokor
that
the
survival
of
the
fittest
is
a
rule
which
governs
man
as
well
as
men
it
applies
to
the
entire
population
strokor
just
as
truly
as
to
me
or
thee
in
fine
we
men
who
are
now
the
sole
inhabitants
of
this
world
are
descended
from
a
race
of
people
who
survived
solely
because
they
were
fitter
than
the
mulikka
fitter
than
the
reptiles
the
fittest
by
far
of
all
the
creatures
that
being
the
case
it
is
plain
that
in
time
either
our
empire
or
that
of
klow
must
triumph
over
the
other
and
that
which
remains
shall
be
the
fittest
hold
i
cried
why
can
not
matters
remain
just
as
they
now
are
and
forever
that
he
said
rapidly
is
because
thou
knowest
so
little
about
the
future
of
this
world
but
i
am
famed
as
a
student
of
the
heavens
and
i
tell
thee
it
is
possible
by
means
of
certain
delicate
measuring
instruments
together
with
the
highest
mathematics
to
keep
a
very
close
watch
upon
the
course
of
our
world
and
we
now
know
that
our
year
is
much
shorter
than
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
mulikka
i
nodded
my
head
rightly
enough
since
our
days
are
become
steadily
longer
for
some
mysterious
reason
a
reason
no
longer
a
mystery
quoth
maka
it
is
now
known
that
the
sun
is
a
very
powerful
magnet
and
that
it
is
constantly
pulling
upon
our
world
and
bringing
it
nearer
and
nearer
to
himself
that
is
why
it
hath
become
slightly
warmer
during
the
past
hundred
years
the
records
show
it
plain
and
the
same
influence
has
caused
the
lengthening
of
our
day
he
stopped
and
let
me
think
soon
i
saw
it
clearly
enough
a
time
must
come
when
the
increasing
warmth
of
the
sun
would
stifle
all
forms
of
vegetable
life
and
that
would
mean
the
choking
of
mankind
it
might
take
untold
centuries
yet
plainly
enough
the
world
must
some
day
become
too
small
for
even
those
who
now
remained
upon
it
suddenly
i
leaped
to
my
feet
and
strode
the
room
in
my
excitement
ye
are
right
maka
i
shouted
thoroughly
aroused
there
can
not
always
be
the
two
empires
in
time
one
or
the
other
must
prevail
jon
has
willed
it
and
i
stopped
short
and
stared
at
him
i
need
not
tell
ye
which
it
shall
be
i
knew
thou
wouldst
see
the
light
strokor
thou
hast
thy
brains
i
sat
me
down
but
instantly
leaped
up
again
such
was
my
enthusiasm
maka
i
cried
our
emperor
is
not
the
man
for
the
place
it
is
true
that
he
were
a
brave
warrior
in
his
youth
he
won
the
throne
fairly
and
we
have
suffered
him
to
keep
it
because
he
is
a
wise
man
and
because
we
have
had
little
trouble
with
the
men
of
klow
since
their
defeat
two
generations
agone
but
he
today
is
content
to
sit
at
his
ease
and
quote
platitudes
about
live
and
let
live
faugh
i
am
ashamed
that
i
should
even
have
given
ear
to
him
i
stopped
short
and
glared
at
the
old
man
maka
hark
ye
well
if
it
be
the
will
of
jon
to
decide
between
the
men
of
klow
and
the
men
of
vlamaland
then
it
is
my
intent
to
take
a
hand
in
this
decision
aye
my
lad
he
said
tranquilly
and
then
added
quite
as
though
he
knew
what
my
answer
must
be
how
do
ye
intend
to
go
about
it
like
a
man
i
strokor
shall
become
the
emperor
iii
the
throne
a
small
storm
had
come
up
while
maka
and
i
were
talking
now
as
he
was
about
to
quit
me
the
clouds
were
clearing
away
and
an
occasional
stroke
of
lightning
came
down
one
of
these
however
hit
the
ground
such
a
short
distance
away
that
both
of
us
could
smell
the
smoke
my
mind
was
more
alive
than
it
had
ever
been
before
now
what
caused
that
maka
the
lightning
i
mean
we
have
it
nearly
every
day
yet
i
have
never
thought
to
question
it
before
it
is
no
mystery
my
lad
quoth
maka
dodging
into
his
chariot
so
that
he
was
not
wet
i
myself
have
watched
the
thing
from
the
top
of
high
mountains
where
the
air
is
so
light
that
a
man
can
scarce
get
enough
to
fill
his
lungs
and
i
say
unto
you
that
were
it
not
for
what
air
we
have
we
should
have
naught
save
the
lightning
the
space
about
the
air
is
full
of
it
he
started
his
engine
then
leaned
out
into
the
rain
and
said
softly
hold
fast
to
what
thy
father
has
taught
thee
strokor
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
women
is
a
man
job
ahead
of
thee
and
the
future
of
the
empire
is
in
thy
hands
and
as
he
clattered
off
fill
not
thy
head
with
wonderings
about
the
lightning
aye
said
i
right
earnestly
and
immediately
turned
my
thoughts
to
my
new
ambition
and
yet
the
thing
maka
had
just
told
me
kept
coming
back
to
my
mind
and
so
it
does
to
this
very
day
i
know
not
why
i
should
mention
it
at
all
save
that
each
time
i
think
upon
maka
i
also
think
upon
the
lightning
whether
i
will
or
no
i
slept
not
at
all
that
night
but
sat
footnote
it
seems
to
have
been
the
custom
among
the
soldiers
never
to
lie
down
but
to
take
their
sleep
sitting
or
standing
a
habit
not
hard
to
form
where
the
gravitation
was
so
slight
no
doubt
this
also
explains
their
stunted
legs
till
the
dawn
came
thinking
out
a
plan
of
action
by
that
time
i
was
fair
convinced
that
there
was
naught
to
be
gained
by
waiting
waiting
makes
me
impatient
as
well
i
determined
to
act
at
once
and
since
one
day
is
quite
as
good
as
the
next
i
decided
that
this
day
was
to
see
the
thing
begun
i
came
before
the
emperor
at
noon
and
received
my
decorations
within
the
hour
i
had
made
myself
known
to
the
four
and
ninety
men
who
were
to
be
my
command
a
picked
company
all
of
a
height
and
weight
with
bodies
that
lacked
little
of
my
own
perfection
never
was
there
a
finer
guard
about
the
palace
my
first
care
was
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
outgoing
commander
twere
easy
enough
he
was
green
with
envy
anyhow
and
so
it
came
about
that
we
met
about
mid
afternoon
with
seconds
in
a
field
in
the
outskirts
before
supper
was
eaten
my
entire
troop
knew
that
their
new
captain
had
tossed
his
away
without
using
it
had
taken
twenty
balls
from
their
former
commander
weapon
and
while
thus
wounded
had
charged
the
man
and
despatched
him
with
bare
hands
needless
to
say
this
exploit
quite
won
their
hearts
none
but
a
blind
man
could
have
missed
the
respect
they
showed
me
when
all
bandaged
and
sore
i
lined
them
up
next
morning
afterward
i
learned
that
they
had
all
taken
a
pledge
to
follow
strokor
through
the
gates
of
hofe
itself
but
a
week
later
that
fully
recovered
and
in
perfect
fettle
i
called
my
men
together
one
morn
as
the
sun
rose
by
that
time
i
had
given
them
a
sample
of
my
brains
through
ordering
a
rearrangement
of
their
quarters
such
as
made
the
same
much
more
comfortable
also
i
had
dealt
with
one
slight
infraction
of
the
rules
in
such
a
drastic
fashion
that
they
knew
i
would
brook
no
trifling
all
told
is
hard
to
say
whether
they
thought
the
most
of
me
or
of
jon
men
said
i
as
bluntly
as
i
knew
the
emperor
is
an
old
man
and
as
ye
know
he
is
disposed
to
be
lenient
toward
the
men
of
klow
whereas
ye
and
i
well
know
that
the
louts
are
blackguards
now
i
will
tell
ye
more
it
has
come
to
me
lately
that
klow
is
plotting
to
attack
us
with
strange
weapons
i
thought
best
considering
their
ignorance
not
to
give
them
my
own
reasons
of
course
i
have
told
the
emperor
of
it
yet
he
will
not
act
he
says
to
wait
till
we
are
attacked
i
stopped
and
watched
their
faces
sure
enough
the
idea
fair
made
them
ache
each
and
every
one
of
these
men
was
spoiling
for
a
fight
now
tell
me
how
would
ye
like
to
become
the
emperor
i
did
not
have
to
wait
long
the
light
that
flared
in
their
faces
told
me
plainly
and
how
would
ye
like
to
have
me
for
your
emperor
at
that
their
tongues
were
loosed
and
i
hindered
them
not
they
yelled
for
pure
joy
and
pressed
about
me
like
a
pack
of
children
i
saw
that
the
time
was
ripe
for
action
up
then
i
roared
and
of
course
led
the
way
we
met
the
guard
on
the
lower
stairs
and
from
that
point
on
we
fair
hacked
our
way
through
well
no
need
to
describe
the
fight
for
a
time
i
thought
we
were
gone
the
guards
had
a
cunningly
devised
labyrinth
on
the
second
floor
and
attacked
us
from
holes
in
a
false
ceiling
so
that
we
suffered
heavily
at
first
but
i
saw
what
was
amiss
and
shouted
to
my
men
to
clear
away
the
timbers
and
after
that
it
was
clear
work
i
lost
forty
men
before
the
guard
was
disposed
of
the
emperor
i
finished
myself
he
dodged
right
spryly
for
a
time
but
at
last
i
caught
him
and
tossed
him
to
the
foot
of
the
upper
stairs
and
there
he
still
lies
for
none
of
my
men
would
touch
him
nor
would
i
we
covered
him
with
quicklime
and
some
earth
as
soon
as
we
had
taken
care
of
those
who
were
not
too
far
gone
i
called
the
men
together
and
caused
a
round
of
spirits
to
be
served
then
we
all
feasted
on
the
emperor
store
and
soon
were
feeling
like
ourselves
men
i
said
impressively
i
am
proud
of
ye
never
did
an
emperor
have
such
a
dangerous
gang
of
bullies
at
that
they
all
grinned
happily
and
i
added
and
is
a
fine
staff
of
generals
that
ye
make
need
i
say
more
those
men
would
have
overturned
the
palace
for
me
had
i
said
the
word
as
it
was
they
obeyed
my
next
orders
in
such
a
spirit
that
success
was
assured
from
the
first
first
using
the
dead
emperor
name
i
caused
the
various
chiefs
to
be
brought
together
at
once
to
the
court
chamber
at
the
same
time
i
contrived
by
means
i
need
not
go
into
here
to
prevent
any
word
of
our
action
from
getting
abroad
so
when
the
former
staff
faced
me
the
next
morning
they
learned
that
they
were
to
be
executed
i
could
trust
not
one
they
were
all
friends
of
the
old
man
with
the
chiefs
out
of
the
way
and
my
own
men
taking
their
commands
the
whole
army
fell
into
my
hands
true
there
were
some
insurrections
here
and
there
but
my
men
handled
them
with
such
speed
and
harshness
that
any
further
stubbornness
turned
to
admiration
by
this
time
the
fame
of
strokor
was
spread
throughout
the
empire
and
thus
it
came
about
that
within
a
week
of
the
night
that
old
maka
first
put
the
idea
into
my
head
strokor
son
of
strok
reigned
throughout
vlamaland
and
to
make
it
complete
the
army
celebrated
my
accession
by
taking
a
pledge
before
jon
to
strokor
the
fittest
of
the
fit
iv
the
assault
now
out
of
a
total
population
of
perhaps
three
million
i
had
about
a
fighters
in
my
half
of
the
world
klow
by
comparison
had
but
the
number
his
land
was
not
a
rich
one
but
he
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
some
while
in
advance
of
the
new
ruler
in
vlama
and
shortly
my
spies
reported
that
his
armories
were
devising
a
new
type
of
weapon
was
a
strange
verification
of
my
own
fiction
to
my
men
i
could
learn
nothing
however
about
it
meanwhile
i
caused
a
vast
number
of
to
be
built
all
in
secret
each
of
them
was
intended
for
a
single
fighter
and
his
supplies
and
each
was
so
arranged
with
side
paddle
wheels
that
it
would
be
driven
by
the
motor
in
the
soldier
chariot
and
thus
give
each
his
own
boat
again
discarding
all
precedent
i
packed
not
all
my
forces
together
as
had
been
done
in
the
past
but
scattered
them
up
and
adown
the
coast
fronting
the
land
of
klow
and
at
a
prearranged
time
my
men
set
out
a
company
in
each
tiny
fleet
some
were
slightly
in
advance
of
the
rest
who
had
the
shorter
distance
to
travel
and
just
as
i
had
planned
we
all
arrived
at
a
certain
spot
on
klow
coast
at
practically
the
same
hour
although
two
nights
later
was
a
brilliant
stroke
the
enemy
looked
not
for
a
fleet
of
ants
ready
to
step
right
out
of
the
sea
into
battle
their
fleet
was
looking
for
us
true
but
not
in
that
shape
and
we
were
all
safely
ashore
before
they
had
ceased
to
scour
the
seas
for
us
i
immediately
placed
my
heavy
machines
and
just
as
all
former
expeditions
had
done
opened
the
assault
at
once
with
a
shower
of
the
poison
shells
i
relied
it
will
be
seen
upon
the
surprise
of
my
attack
to
strike
terror
into
the
hearts
of
the
louts
but
apparently
they
were
prepared
for
anything
no
matter
how
rapid
the
attack
my
bombardment
had
not
proceeded
many
moments
before
to
my
dismay
some
of
their
own
shells
began
to
fall
among
us
soon
they
were
giving
as
good
as
we
now
how
knew
they
that
we
should
come
to
this
spot
i
demanded
of
maka
i
had
placed
him
in
my
cabinet
as
soon
as
i
had
reached
the
throne
the
old
man
stroked
his
beard
gravely
perchance
it
had
been
wrong
to
come
to
the
old
landing
they
simply
began
shelling
it
as
a
matter
of
course
ye
are
right
again
i
told
him
and
forthwith
moved
my
pieces
over
into
another
triangle
previously
of
course
all
my
charioteers
had
gone
on
toward
the
capital
however
i
took
care
to
move
my
machines
one
at
a
time
so
that
there
was
no
in
my
bombardment
but
scarce
had
we
taken
up
the
new
position
before
the
enemy
shells
likewise
shifted
and
began
to
strike
once
more
in
our
midst
i
swore
a
great
oath
and
whirled
upon
maka
in
wrath
think
ye
that
there
be
a
spy
among
us
i
demanded
how
else
can
ye
explain
this
thing
my
men
have
combed
the
land
about
us
there
are
none
of
the
louts
secreted
here
and
even
so
they
could
not
have
notified
klow
so
soon
besides
is
pitch
dark
i
were
sorely
mystified
all
we
could
do
was
to
fling
our
shells
as
fast
as
our
machines
would
work
and
dodge
the
enemy
hail
as
best
we
could
thus
the
time
passed
and
it
were
near
dawn
when
the
first
messengers
footnote
messengers
no
telegraph
or
telephone
much
less
wireless
in
a
civilization
as
strenuous
as
that
of
mercury
there
was
never
enough
consideration
for
others
to
lead
to
such
socially
beneficial
things
as
these
no
more
than
railroads
or
printing
presses
civilization
appears
to
be
in
exact
proportion
to
the
ease
of
getting
a
living
other
conditions
being
equal
returned
they
have
stopped
us
just
outside
the
walls
of
the
city
was
the
report
it
pleased
me
that
they
should
have
pushed
so
far
at
first
i
climbed
at
once
into
my
chariot
now
is
the
time
for
strokor
to
strike
i
gave
orders
for
the
staff
to
remain
where
it
was
i
will
send
ye
word
when
the
city
is
mine
but
before
i
started
my
engine
i
glanced
up
at
the
sky
to
see
if
the
dawn
were
yet
come
and
as
i
gazed
i
thought
i
saw
something
come
between
me
and
a
star
i
brushed
the
hair
away
from
my
eyes
and
looked
again
to
my
boundless
surprise
i
made
out
not
one
but
three
strange
objects
moving
about
swiftly
in
the
air
look
i
cried
and
my
whole
staff
craned
their
necks
in
a
moment
all
had
seen
and
great
was
their
wonder
i
blamed
them
not
for
their
fears
was
maka
who
spoke
first
they
are
much
too
large
to
be
creatures
of
jon
he
muttered
they
must
be
some
trick
of
the
enemy
dost
recall
edam
vision
of
the
creatures
in
the
air
of
jeos
he
went
on
knowing
that
i
would
not
hinder
him
now
as
i
remember
it
he
said
they
flew
with
great
speed
were
it
not
possible
strokor
for
suitable
engines
to
propel
very
light
structures
at
such
high
speed
as
to
remain
suspended
in
the
air
after
the
manner
of
leaves
in
a
storm
i
note
these
strangers
move
quite
fast
it
was
even
so
and
at
that
same
instant
one
of
them
swung
directly
above
our
heads
so
close
that
i
could
hear
the
hum
of
a
powerful
engine
so
it
was
only
a
trick
i
shook
myself
together
attention
my
staff
drew
up
at
the
word
they
are
but
few
fear
them
not
we
waste
no
more
time
here
pack
up
the
machines
and
follow
and
thus
we
charged
upon
klow
i
found
that
my
men
had
entirely
surrounded
the
city
klow
men
were
putting
up
a
plucky
fight
and
showing
no
signs
of
fearing
us
seeing
this
i
blew
a
blast
on
my
engine
whistle
so
that
my
bullies
might
know
that
i
had
come
immediately
the
word
ran
up
and
down
the
line
so
that
within
a
few
minutes
klow
was
facing
a
roaring
crowd
of
terrors
i
myself
set
the
example
by
charging
the
nearest
group
of
the
enemy
all
of
whom
were
mounted
within
the
rather
small
and
perfectly
circular
chariots
which
they
preferred
they
were
quick
but
slippery
also
they
could
not
stand
before
a
determined
rush
as
several
of
them
learned
after
vainly
trying
to
slip
some
balls
through
my
windows
and
failing
in
that
striving
to
get
away
from
me
but
i
ran
them
down
and
toppled
them
over
and
dropped
suffocation
bombs
into
their
little
cages
with
such
vigor
and
disregard
of
their
volleys
that
my
men
could
not
resist
the
example
we
charged
all
along
that
vast
circular
line
and
we
cheered
mightily
when
the
whole
front
broke
turned
tail
and
ran
before
us
but
scarce
had
they
got
away
before
a
queer
thing
happened
a
flock
of
those
great
some
eight
altogether
rose
up
from
the
middle
of
the
city
it
was
now
fairly
light
and
we
could
see
well
one
of
them
had
some
sort
of
engine
trouble
so
that
it
had
to
return
at
once
but
the
other
seven
came
out
to
the
and
began
to
circle
the
city
as
they
did
so
they
dropped
odd
misshapen
parcels
totally
unlike
materials
of
war
but
when
they
struck
they
gave
off
prodigious
puffs
of
a
greenish
smoke
of
so
terribly
pungent
a
nature
that
my
men
dropped
before
it
like
apples
from
a
shaken
tree
was
a
fearful
sight
lucky
for
us
that
the
louts
had
had
no
practice
else
few
of
us
should
be
alive
to
tell
the
tale
and
so
they
swept
around
the
great
circle
many
triangles
in
area
and
everywhere
the
unthinkable
things
smote
the
hearts
of
my
men
with
a
fear
they
had
never
known
only
one
of
the
devices
suffered
it
was
brought
down
by
a
chance
fling
of
a
poison
shell
the
rest
after
loosing
their
burdens
returned
to
the
city
for
more
i
am
no
fool
i
saw
that
we
could
do
nothing
against
such
weapons
but
must
use
all
our
wits
if
we
escaped
even
return
i
commanded
and
instantly
my
staff
whistled
the
code
the
men
obeyed
with
alacrity
making
off
at
top
speed
with
the
men
of
klow
in
hot
pursuit
although
able
to
do
little
damage
aye
it
were
a
sorrowful
thing
that
retreat
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
remain
till
the
very
last
having
to
deal
with
a
number
of
persistent
louts
who
all
but
suffocated
me
at
that
but
i
managed
to
empty
my
slinger
into
some
of
them
and
to
topple
the
rest
i
was
mainly
angry
that
klow
had
not
showed
himself
by
the
time
i
had
reached
the
seashore
most
of
my
men
were
in
their
boats
again
i
stayed
till
the
last
although
i
could
see
the
fleet
bearing
down
hard
upon
us
from
the
north
in
truth
we
would
have
all
been
lost
had
we
come
in
the
manner
of
former
campaigns
all
together
in
big
transports
but
because
we
could
scatter
every
which
way
the
fleet
harmed
us
little
and
of
us
got
safely
back
happily
none
of
the
had
range
enough
to
reach
vlamaland
as
soon
as
i
could
get
my
staff
together
i
gave
orders
such
as
would
insure
discipline
then
reminding
my
hearties
that
klow
knowing
our
helplessness
would
surely
attack
as
soon
as
fully
equipped
i
made
this
offer
to
the
man
who
shall
suggest
the
best
way
of
meeting
their
attack
i
shall
give
the
third
of
my
empire
so
they
knew
that
the
case
was
desperate
as
for
myself
i
slept
not
a
bit
but
paced
my
and
thought
deeply
now
a
bit
of
a
shell
from
an
enemy
slinger
had
penetrated
my
arm
till
now
i
had
paid
no
attention
to
it
but
it
began
to
bother
me
so
i
pulled
the
metal
from
my
arm
with
my
teeth
and
quite
by
chance
i
placed
the
billet
on
the
table
within
a
few
inches
of
the
compass
i
had
carried
on
my
boat
to
my
intense
surprise
the
needle
of
the
compass
swung
violently
about
so
that
one
end
pointed
directly
at
the
fragment
of
metal
i
moved
them
closer
together
there
was
no
doubt
that
they
were
strongly
attracted
the
enemy
shells
were
made
of
mere
iron
the
moment
i
fully
realized
this
i
saw
clearly
how
we
might
baffle
the
men
of
klow
i
instantly
summoned
some
men
gave
the
orders
much
as
though
i
had
known
for
years
what
was
to
be
done
and
in
a
few
moments
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
my
messengers
hurrying
north
and
south
and
so
it
came
about
that
within
three
days
of
our
shameful
retreat
a
tenth
of
my
men
were
at
work
on
the
new
project
as
yet
there
was
no
word
from
my
spies
across
the
sea
but
we
worked
with
all
possible
haste
and
this
very
briefly
is
what
we
did
we
laid
a
gigantic
line
of
iron
clear
across
the
empire
from
north
to
south
from
snow
to
snow
one
end
was
bedded
in
the
island
of
pathna
where
the
north
is
found
while
the
other
stopped
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
world
in
a
hole
dug
through
the
ice
into
the
solid
earth
of
the
south
polar
plain
and
every
foot
of
that
enormous
rod
as
big
around
as
my
leg
was
insulated
from
the
ground
with
pieces
of
our
secret
alloy
not
for
nothing
had
our
chemists
sought
the
metal
which
would
resist
the
lightning
and
not
for
nothing
did
my
bullies
piece
the
rod
together
all
working
at
the
same
time
so
that
the
whole
thing
were
complete
in
seven
days
that
is
complete
save
for
the
final
connecting
link
and
that
lay
a
loglike
roll
of
iron
at
the
door
of
my
palace
ready
to
be
rolled
into
place
when
i
were
but
ready
and
on
the
morrow
the
klow
reached
our
shores
v
the
victory
my
first
intent
was
to
let
them
advance
unhampered
but
maka
pointed
out
that
such
a
policy
might
give
them
suspicions
and
so
we
disputed
their
course
all
the
way
i
gave
orders
to
show
no
great
amount
of
resistance
and
thus
the
louts
reached
vlama
in
high
feather
confident
that
the
game
was
theirs
i
stood
at
the
door
of
the
palace
as
klow
himself
rolled
up
to
the
edge
of
the
my
men
obeying
orders
had
given
way
to
him
his
crews
swarmed
the
space
behind
and
on
all
sides
of
him
while
my
own
bullies
were
all
about
and
behind
the
palace
never
did
two
such
giant
armies
face
one
another
in
peace
for
i
had
caused
my
banner
to
be
floated
wrong
end
to
in
token
of
surrender
first
a
small
body
of
subordinates
waited
upon
me
demanding
that
i
give
up
the
throne
i
answered
that
i
would
treat
with
none
save
klow
himself
and
shortly
the
knave
surrounded
by
perhaps
fifty
underlings
stepped
up
before
me
hail
stroker
he
growled
his
voice
shaking
a
bit
with
excitement
not
with
fear
for
he
were
a
brave
man
hail
to
thee
and
to
thine
and
a
pleasant
stay
in
hofe
for
ye
all
hail
klow
replied
i
glancing
up
meaningly
at
the
air
monsters
wheeling
there
i
take
it
that
ye
purpose
to
execute
us
aye
he
growled
savagely
thou
didst
attack
without
provocation
thy
life
is
forfeit
and
as
many
more
as
may
be
found
needful
to
guarantee
peace
then
i
quoth
my
manner
changing
then
ye
have
saved
me
the
trouble
of
deciding
what
shall
be
thy
fate
execution
say
you
so
be
it
and
i
strode
down
to
the
great
log
of
iron
which
lay
ready
to
fill
the
gap
klow
looked
at
me
with
a
peculiar
expression
as
though
he
thought
me
mad
true
it
looked
it
how
could
i
do
him
harm
without
myself
suffering
but
i
kicked
the
props
which
held
the
iron
and
gave
it
a
start
with
my
foot
the
ends
of
the
rod
lay
concealed
by
brush
perchance
fifty
yards
away
in
ten
seconds
that
last
section
had
rolled
completely
between
them
and
only
a
fool
would
have
missed
seeing
that
the
last
ten
feet
the
iron
was
fair
jerked
through
the
air
as
this
happened
we
all
heard
a
tremendous
crackling
like
that
of
nearby
lightning
while
enormous
clouds
of
dust
arose
from
the
two
concealed
ends
which
were
now
become
connections
and
at
the
same
time
a
loud
steely
click
just
one
and
no
more
sounded
from
the
intruding
host
for
a
moment
klow
was
vastly
puzzled
then
he
snarled
angrily
what
means
this
foolery
strokor
advance
and
give
up
thy
ax
for
answer
i
turned
me
about
so
as
to
face
my
men
and
held
up
my
hand
in
signal
instantly
the
whistles
sounded
and
my
hearties
came
bounding
into
the
field
treachery
shouted
klow
and
his
officers
ran
here
and
there
shouting
to
arms
charge
and
destroy
no
quarter
but
i
paid
little
attention
to
the
hubbub
i
were
gazing
up
at
those
infernal
creatures
of
the
air
and
my
heart
sang
within
me
as
i
saw
them
circling
erratically
but
very
surely
down
to
the
earth
and
as
they
came
nearer
my
satisfaction
was
entire
for
their
engines
were
silent
at
the
same
time
consternation
was
reigning
among
our
visitors
not
a
man
of
all
klow
thousands
was
able
to
move
his
car
or
lift
a
weapon
every
slinger
was
jammed
as
though
frozen
by
invisible
ice
all
their
balls
and
shells
were
stuck
together
like
the
work
of
a
transparent
glue
even
their
side
arms
were
locked
in
their
scabbards
and
all
their
tugging
could
budge
them
not
but
none
of
my
men
were
so
handicapped
each
man
chariot
was
running
as
though
naught
had
happened
they
thundered
forward
discharging
their
balls
and
shells
as
freely
as
they
had
across
the
sea
their
charge
was
a
murderous
one
not
a
man
of
klow
was
able
to
resist
save
with
what
force
he
could
put
into
his
bare
hands
klow
saw
all
this
from
the
middle
of
his
group
of
officers
none
were
able
to
more
than
place
his
body
us
and
their
chief
in
a
very
few
moments
they
saw
that
the
unknown
magic
had
made
them
as
children
in
our
hands
they
were
utterly
lost
and
klow
turned
away
from
the
sight
with
a
black
face
again
he
faced
me
what
means
this
ye
huge
bundle
of
lies
what
mean
ye
by
tricking
us
with
yon
badge
of
surrender
only
to
tie
our
hands
with
thy
magic
of
hofe
is
this
the
way
to
fight
like
a
man
i
had
stood
at
ease
in
my
door
since
rolling
the
iron
now
i
looked
about
me
still
more
easily
my
men
were
running
down
the
louts
who
had
jumped
from
their
useless
chariots
and
taken
to
their
heels
but
a
matter
of
time
before
the
army
of
klow
would
be
no
more
at
that
rate
klow
i
answered
him
mildly
ye
are
right
this
is
not
the
way
to
fight
like
a
man
neither
i
pointed
out
one
of
the
fallen
neither
is
that
the
way
flitting
over
our
heads
like
shadows
and
destroying
us
with
filthy
smoke
shame
on
ye
klow
for
stooping
to
such
and
upon
thy
own
head
be
the
blame
for
the
trick
i
have
played
upon
ye
you
attacked
us
without
provocation
he
muttered
sourly
aye
and
for
a
very
good
reason
i
replied
yet
i
see
thy
viewpoint
and
shalt
give
thee
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
i
turned
to
my
whistlers
and
gave
an
order
so
that
presently
the
great
slaughter
had
stopped
my
men
and
klow
alike
struggled
back
to
see
what
were
amiss
i
handed
klow
an
ax
throw
away
thine
own
scabbard
and
all
i
told
him
it
is
useless
for
is
made
of
iron
ours
and
all
our
tools
of
war
are
formed
of
an
alloy
which
is
immune
from
the
magic
he
took
the
ax
in
wonderment
what
means
it
strokor
asked
he
again
meanwhile
stripping
himself
in
a
businesslike
fashion
that
it
were
good
to
see
it
means
said
i
throwing
off
my
robe
that
i
have
unchained
the
magnetism
of
this
world
know
you
klow
that
all
of
the
children
of
the
sun
are
full
of
his
power
it
is
like
unto
that
of
the
tiny
magnet
which
ye
give
children
for
to
play
but
it
is
mighty
even
as
our
world
is
mighty
good
jon
he
gasped
for
his
was
not
a
daring
mind
what
have
ye
done
ye
trifler
i
have
transformed
this
empire
into
one
vast
magnet
i
answered
coolly
then
i
showed
him
a
boulder
on
the
summit
of
a
distant
hill
through
the
tube
klow
could
see
some
of
my
men
standing
beside
it
place
one
of
thy
own
men
on
the
roof
of
the
palace
i
told
klow
and
give
him
orders
to
lower
my
banner
should
ye
give
him
the
word
for
upon
the
outcome
of
this
fight
me
and
thee
klow
hinges
the
whole
affair
if
thou
dost
survive
down
comes
my
banner
and
my
men
on
the
hill
shall
topple
the
boulder
which
shall
rush
down
the
slope
and
burst
the
iron
rod
and
break
the
spell
stand
then
and
defend
thyself
and
it
did
me
good
to
see
the
spirit
fly
into
his
eyes
he
saw
that
his
empire
lived
or
died
as
he
lived
or
died
and
he
fought
as
he
had
never
fought
before
small
man
that
he
was
beside
myself
he
were
wondrous
quick
and
sure
in
his
motions
before
i
knew
it
he
had
bit
his
ax
deep
into
my
side
and
in
another
moment
or
two
it
was
over
for
as
soon
as
i
felt
the
pain
of
that
gash
i
flung
my
own
blade
away
and
with
a
roar
such
as
would
have
shaken
a
stouter
heart
than
his
i
charged
the
man
took
a
second
fearful
blow
full
on
my
chest
and
heeding
it
not
at
all
i
snatched
the
ax
from
his
hands
then
as
he
turned
to
run
i
dropped
that
tool
also
and
i
ran
him
down
and
felled
him
and
broke
his
head
with
my
hands
vi
the
fittest
footnote
this
chapter
was
originally
as
long
as
the
others
but
an
unfortunate
accident
of
smith
before
he
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
machine
mutilated
a
large
portion
of
the
tape
so
badly
that
it
was
made
worthless
this
explains
why
something
appears
to
be
missing
from
the
account
and
also
why
this
chapter
begins
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
slaves
but
the
most
were
slain
neither
could
we
bother
with
their
women
and
others
left
behind
now
by
this
time
the
empire
was
as
one
man
in
its
worship
of
me
i
had
been
emperor
but
a
year
and
already
i
had
made
it
certain
that
only
the
men
of
vlamaland
and
no
others
should
live
in
the
sight
of
jon
so
well
thought
they
of
me
i
might
fair
have
sat
upon
my
reputation
and
have
spent
my
last
days
in
feasting
like
the
man
before
me
but
i
was
still
too
young
and
full
of
energy
to
take
my
ease
i
found
myself
more
and
more
restless
i
had
naught
to
do
it
had
all
been
done
at
last
i
sent
for
old
maka
ye
put
me
up
to
this
ye
old
fraud
i
told
him
pretending
to
be
wrathful
now
set
me
another
task
or
i
have
thy
head
he
knew
me
too
well
to
be
affrighted
he
said
that
he
had
been
considering
my
case
of
late
strokor
thy
father
was
right
when
he
told
thee
to
have
naught
to
do
with
women
that
is
to
say
he
were
right
at
the
time
were
he
alive
today
i
forgot
to
say
that
my
father
was
killed
in
the
battle
across
the
sea
he
would
of
a
certainty
say
that
it
were
high
time
for
thee
to
pick
thy
mate
remember
strokor
great
though
thou
art
yet
when
death
taketh
thee
thy
greatness
is
become
a
memory
methinks
ye
should
leave
something
more
substantial
behind
it
took
but
little
thought
to
convince
me
that
maka
were
right
once
more
fact
as
soon
as
i
thought
upon
it
it
were
a
woman
that
i
was
restless
for
the
mere
notion
instantly
gave
me
something
worth
while
to
look
forward
to
jon
bless
thee
i
told
the
old
man
ye
have
named
both
the
trouble
and
the
remedy
i
will
attend
to
it
at
once
he
sat
thinking
for
some
time
longer
has
thought
of
any
woman
in
special
strokor
said
he
i
had
not
the
idea
was
too
new
to
me
the
best
in
the
world
shall
be
mine
of
course
i
told
him
but
as
for
which
one
hast
any
notion
thyself
aye
he
quoth
is
my
own
niece
i
have
in
mind
perchance
ye
remember
her
a
pretty
child
who
was
with
me
when
thou
didst
save
my
life
up
there
on
the
mountainside
i
recalled
the
chit
fairly
well
but
she
were
not
a
vigorous
woman
maka
think
you
she
is
fit
for
me
aye
if
any
be
he
replied
earnestly
ave
is
not
robust
true
but
her
muscles
are
as
wires
it
is
because
of
what
lies
in
her
head
however
that
i
commend
her
i
have
taught
her
all
i
know
so
i
exclaimed
much
pleased
then
she
is
indeed
fit
to
be
the
empress
and
as
i
recall
her
she
were
exceedingly
good
to
look
at
say
no
more
ave
shall
be
the
wife
of
strokor
and
so
it
was
arranged
well
and
there
ye
have
the
story
of
strokor
the
mightiest
man
in
the
world
and
the
wisest
more
than
this
i
shall
not
tell
with
my
own
lips
i
shall
have
singers
recite
my
deeds
until
half
the
compartments
in
the
house
of
words
is
filled
with
the
records
thereof
but
it
were
well
that
i
should
tell
this
much
in
mine
own
way
my
ambition
is
fulfilled
let
the
hand
of
jon
descend
upon
our
world
if
it
may
i
care
not
if
presently
the
sun
come
nearer
and
the
water
dry
up
and
the
days
grow
longer
and
longer
till
the
day
and
the
year
become
of
the
same
length
i
care
not
my
people
such
as
be
left
of
them
shall
own
what
there
is
and
shall
live
as
long
as
life
is
possible
i
shall
leave
behind
no
race
of
weaklings
every
man
shall
be
fit
to
live
and
the
fittest
of
them
all
shall
live
the
longer
and
he
no
matter
how
many
cycles
hence
shall
look
back
to
strokor
and
to
ave
his
wife
and
shall
say
i
am
what
i
am
the
last
man
on
the
world
because
strokor
was
the
fittest
man
of
his
time
aye
my
fame
shall
live
as
long
as
there
be
life
tonight
as
i
speak
these
things
into
the
word
machine
my
heart
is
singing
with
the
joy
of
it
all
thank
jon
i
were
born
a
man
not
a
woman
tomorrow
i
go
to
fetch
ave
i
shall
not
send
for
her
i
can
not
trust
her
beauty
to
the
hands
of
my
crew
the
more
i
think
of
her
the
more
i
see
that
mine
whole
life
hath
been
devised
for
this
one
moment
i
see
that
insignificant
though
she
be
ave
is
a
needed
link
in
the
chain
i
have
come
to
want
her
more
than
food
i
am
become
a
lovesick
fool
aye
i
can
afford
to
poke
fun
at
myself
i
can
afford
anything
in
this
world
for
i
be
its
greatest
man
its
greatest
man
here
is
the
place
to
stop
there
is
no
more
i
can
say
the
story
is
done
the
story
of
strokor
the
greatest
man
in
the
whole
world
vii
the
going
several
years
since
last
i
faced
this
machine
many
and
many
a
day
since
i
said
that
my
story
was
done
and
placed
the
record
on
the
shelf
of
my
anteroom
my
heart
full
of
satisfaction
and
today
i
must
needs
add
another
record
perhaps
two
to
the
pile
when
i
set
out
for
the
highlands
on
the
morn
following
what
i
last
related
i
took
with
me
but
two
or
three
men
not
that
i
had
any
need
for
guards
but
because
it
looketh
not
well
for
the
emperor
to
travel
without
retainers
however
few
practically
i
was
alone
i
reached
the
locality
as
the
sun
went
down
the
sky
was
a
brilliant
color
i
remember
it
well
darkness
would
come
soon
though
not
as
quickly
as
farther
south
commonly
i
think
not
upon
such
trifles
but
i
were
nearing
my
love
and
tender
things
came
easily
to
my
mind
my
chariot
kept
to
the
road
which
lay
alongside
the
irrigating
flume
a
stone
trough
which
runs
from
the
hills
to
the
dry
country
below
i
had
already
noted
this
flume
where
it
emptied
into
the
basin
in
the
valley
below
for
it
had
had
a
new
kind
of
a
spillway
affixed
to
it
a
broad
smooth
platform
with
a
slightly
upward
curve
over
which
the
water
was
shooting
i
saw
no
sense
in
the
arrangement
and
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
maka
about
it
for
the
empire
prized
this
trough
most
highly
it
ran
straight
and
true
over
expensive
bridges
where
needed
with
scarce
a
bend
to
hold
back
the
flow
when
i
stopped
my
car
outside
the
house
i
was
surprised
that
none
should
come
out
to
greet
me
maka
had
sent
word
of
my
coming
all
should
have
been
in
readiness
but
i
was
forced
to
use
my
whistle
there
was
no
stir
i
became
angry
i
told
my
bullies
to
stay
where
they
were
and
myself
burst
in
the
door
the
house
was
a
sturdy
stone
affair
of
one
floor
set
against
the
side
of
the
mountain
a
short
distance
above
the
flume
i
looked
about
the
interior
in
surprise
for
not
a
soul
was
in
sight
in
any
of
the
compartments
there
were
signs
that
people
had
been
there
but
a
few
moments
before
i
called
it
strange
for
i
had
seen
no
one
leave
the
house
as
i
approached
at
last
as
i
was
inspecting
the
eating
place
i
noted
a
small
door
let
into
the
outer
wall
it
was
open
and
by
squeezing
i
managed
to
get
through
i
found
that
it
let
into
a
long
dark
passage
i
followed
this
going
steadily
down
a
flight
of
stairs
and
all
of
a
sudden
bumped
into
an
iron
grating
at
the
same
moment
i
saw
that
the
passageway
made
a
turn
just
beyond
and
by
craning
my
neck
and
straining
my
eyes
i
could
see
a
faintly
lighted
chamber
just
a
few
feet
away
and
before
my
eyes
could
scarce
make
out
the
figures
of
some
people
in
the
middle
of
the
place
a
voice
came
to
my
ear
hail
strokor
it
said
and
great
was
my
astonishment
as
i
recognized
the
tones
of
edam
the
young
dreamer
whom
maka
had
brought
to
my
house
edam
i
cried
what
do
ye
here
come
and
open
these
bars
he
made
no
reply
save
to
laugh
in
a
way
i
did
not
like
i
shook
the
grating
savagely
so
that
i
felt
it
give
edam
i
roared
open
this
grating
at
once
and
tell
me
where
is
ave
i
am
here
came
another
voice
and
i
stopped
in
sheer
surprise
to
peer
closer
and
to
see
for
the
first
time
that
it
were
really
the
dreamer
and
the
chit
these
two
and
no
more
who
sat
there
in
the
underground
chamber
they
seemed
to
be
sitting
in
some
sort
of
a
box
with
glass
windows
ave
come
here
i
spoke
much
more
gently
than
to
edam
for
my
heart
was
soft
with
thoughts
of
her
it
is
thy
lord
strokor
the
emperor
who
calls
thee
come
i
stay
here
said
she
in
the
same
clear
voice
entirely
unshaken
by
my
presence
edam
hath
claimed
me
and
i
shall
cleave
to
him
i
want
none
of
ye
ye
giant
for
a
moment
i
was
minded
to
throw
my
weight
against
the
barrier
such
was
my
rage
then
i
thought
better
on
it
and
closely
examined
the
bars
two
were
loose
ave
said
i
contriving
to
keep
my
voice
even
although
my
hands
were
busy
with
the
bars
as
i
spake
ave
ye
do
wrong
to
spite
me
thus
know
ye
not
that
i
am
the
emperor
and
that
these
bars
can
not
stand
before
me
i
warn
ye
if
i
must
call
my
men
to
help
me
and
to
witness
my
shame
it
will
go
hard
with
ye
better
that
ye
should
come
willingly
ye
are
not
for
such
as
edam
no
quoth
the
young
man
speaking
up
for
the
chit
ye
are
wrong
strokor
we
defy
thee
to
do
thy
worst
we
are
prepared
to
flee
from
ye
at
all
costs
i
had
twisted
one
of
the
bars
out
of
my
way
without
their
seeing
it
i
strove
at
the
next
as
i
answered
still
controlling
my
voice
do
ye
no
good
to
flee
edam
ye
know
that
and
as
for
ave
she
shall
wish
she
had
never
been
born
so
i
should
she
replied
with
spirit
if
i
were
to
become
thy
woman
but
know
you
strokor
that
ave
the
daughter
of
durok
would
rather
die
than
take
the
name
of
one
who
had
spurned
her
as
ye
did
me
so
i
had
it
had
slipped
my
mind
but
i
want
thee
now
ave
said
i
softly
preparing
to
slip
through
the
opening
i
had
made
surely
ye
would
not
take
thine
own
life
nay
she
answered
with
a
laugh
in
her
voice
rather
i
would
go
with
edam
here
i
would
go
she
finished
her
voice
rising
in
her
excitement
away
from
this
horrible
man
world
away
from
it
all
strokor
and
to
jeos
hear
ye
to
jeos
and
but
at
that
instant
i
burst
through
the
grating
without
a
sound
i
charged
straight
for
the
pair
of
them
and
without
a
sound
they
slipped
away
from
before
my
grasp
next
second
i
was
gazing
stupidly
at
the
rushing
swirling
water
of
the
flume
and
i
saw
that
they
had
been
sitting
in
the
cabin
of
a
tiny
boat
and
that
they
had
got
away
there
was
an
opening
into
the
outer
air
i
rushed
through
and
stared
in
the
growing
twilight
down
the
black
furrow
of
the
flume
far
in
the
distance
and
going
like
a
streak
i
spied
the
glittering
glass
windows
of
the
little
craft
once
i
made
out
the
flutter
of
a
saucy
hand
we
shall
get
them
when
they
reach
the
valley
i
shouted
to
the
men
then
i
reached
for
my
tube
and
sighted
it
on
the
lower
end
of
the
flume
far
far
below
almost
too
far
away
to
be
clear
to
the
naked
eye
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
craft
reached
the
end
it
traveled
at
an
extraordinary
rate
perchance
was
weighted
i
marveled
that
its
windows
could
stand
the
force
of
the
air
and
i
scarce
had
time
to
fear
that
the
twain
should
be
destroyed
on
that
upturned
spillway
before
it
was
there
and
then
an
awesome
thing
happened
as
the
boat
struck
the
incline
it
shot
upward
into
the
air
at
a
steep
slant
up
up
it
went
my
heart
jumped
into
my
mouth
for
surely
they
must
be
crushed
when
they
came
down
but
the
craft
did
not
come
down
it
went
on
and
on
up
and
up
its
speed
scarcely
slackened
was
like
that
of
a
shooting
star
and
in
far
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
the
little
boat
was
high
up
among
the
stars
going
higher
every
instant
and
farther
away
from
me
and
suddenly
the
sweat
broke
cold
on
my
forehead
for
dead
ahead
directly
in
line
with
their
travel
lay
the
bluish
white
gleam
of
jeos
so
great
was
my
rage
over
the
escape
of
the
dreamer
with
my
woman
at
first
i
felt
no
sorrow
later
after
days
and
days
of
search
in
and
about
the
basin
i
came
to
grieve
most
terribly
over
my
loss
when
i
came
home
to
the
palace
i
was
ill
in
vain
did
i
make
the
most
generous
of
rewards
the
whole
empire
turned
out
to
search
for
the
missing
ones
but
nothing
came
of
it
all
yet
i
never
ceased
to
hope
especially
after
my
talk
with
maka
aye
he
said
when
i
questioned
him
it
were
barely
possible
that
they
have
left
this
world
for
all
time
i
have
calculated
the
speed
which
their
craft
might
have
attained
had
it
the
right
proportions
and
in
truth
it
might
have
left
the
spillway
at
such
a
speed
that
it
entirely
overcame
the
draw
of
the
ground
but
i
think
it
were
a
slim
chance
it
is
more
than
likely
strokor
that
ave
shall
return
to
thee
was
i
not
the
fitter
man
surely
edam
purpose
could
not
succeed
jon
would
not
have
it
so
the
woman
was
mine
because
i
had
chosen
her
and
she
must
come
back
to
me
and
in
safety
or
i
should
tear
edam
into
bits
but
as
time
went
on
and
naught
transpired
i
became
more
and
more
melancholy
life
became
an
empty
thing
it
had
been
empty
enough
before
i
had
craved
the
girl
but
now
it
was
empty
with
hopelessness
after
a
while
i
got
to
thinking
of
some
of
the
things
maka
had
told
me
the
more
i
thought
of
the
future
the
blacker
it
seemed
true
there
were
many
other
women
but
there
had
been
only
one
no
such
beauty
had
ever
graced
this
world
before
and
i
knew
i
could
be
happy
with
no
other
now
i
saw
that
all
my
fame
had
been
in
vain
i
had
lost
the
only
woman
that
was
fit
for
me
and
when
i
died
there
would
be
naught
left
but
my
name
even
that
the
next
emperor
might
blot
out
if
he
chose
it
had
all
been
in
vain
it
shall
not
be
i
roared
to
myself
as
i
strode
about
my
compartment
gnawing
at
my
hands
in
my
misery
and
in
just
such
a
fit
of
helpless
anger
the
great
idea
came
to
me
no
sooner
conceived
than
put
into
practice
i
will
not
go
closely
into
details
i
will
relate
just
the
outstanding
facts
what
i
did
was
to
select
a
very
tall
mountain
located
almost
on
the
equator
and
proclaimed
my
intention
to
erect
a
monument
to
jon
upon
its
summit
i
caused
vast
quanities
of
materials
to
be
brought
to
the
place
and
for
a
year
a
hundred
thousand
men
labored
to
put
the
pieces
together
when
they
had
finished
they
had
made
a
mammoth
tower
partly
of
wood
and
partly
of
alloy
it
was
made
in
sections
so
that
it
might
be
placed
piece
upon
piece
one
above
another
high
into
the
sky
it
was
an
enormous
task
when
it
was
complete
i
had
a
tower
as
high
as
the
mountain
itself
erected
upon
its
summit
and
next
i
caused
section
after
section
of
the
long
iron
rod
which
had
tricked
klow
to
be
hauled
up
into
the
tower
i
was
only
careful
to
begin
the
process
from
the
top
and
work
downward
i
gave
word
that
the
last
three
sections
be
inserted
at
midday
at
a
given
day
and
at
that
hour
i
was
safe
inside
a
room
i
know
right
well
when
the
deed
was
done
there
was
a
most
terrific
earthquake
all
about
me
though
i
could
see
nothing
at
all
i
could
hear
buildings
falling
the
din
was
appalling
at
the
same
time
the
air
was
fairly
shattered
with
the
rattle
of
the
lightning
never
have
i
heard
the
like
before
the
rod
had
loosed
the
wrath
of
the
forces
above
our
air
and
as
suddenly
the
whole
deafening
storm
ended
perchance
the
rod
was
destroyed
by
the
lightning
i
never
went
to
see
for
i
know
the
electricity
split
the
very
ground
apart
but
i
gazed
out
of
a
window
in
the
top
of
my
palace
and
saw
that
i
had
succeeded
not
a
soul
but
myself
remained
alive
none
but
buildings
made
of
the
alloy
were
standing
not
only
man
but
most
of
his
works
had
perished
in
that
awful
blast
i
alone
remained
i
strokor
am
the
survivor
i
the
greatest
man
it
were
but
fit
that
i
should
be
the
last
no
man
shall
come
after
me
to
honor
me
or
not
as
he
chooses
i
and
no
other
shall
be
the
last
man
and
when
ave
returns
as
she
must
though
it
be
ages
hence
when
she
comes
she
shall
find
me
waiting
i
strokor
the
mighty
and
wise
shall
be
here
when
she
returns
i
shall
wait
for
her
forever
here
i
shall
always
stay
the
stars
may
move
from
their
places
but
i
shall
not
go
for
it
is
my
intention
to
make
use
of
another
secret
maka
taught
me
in
brief
footnote
the
record
ends
here
it
may
be
that
strokor
left
the
machine
for
some
trivial
reason
and
forgot
to
finish
his
story
at
all
events
it
is
necessary
to
refer
to
the
further
discoveries
of
the
expedition
in
order
to
learn
the
outcome
of
it
all
part
iii
the
survivor
provided
with
a
a
crowbar
and
a
hydraulic
jack
and
even
with
drills
and
explosives
as
a
last
resort
jackson
kinney
and
van
emmon
returned
the
same
day
to
the
room
in
the
top
of
that
mystifying
mansion
the
materials
they
carried
would
have
made
considerable
of
a
load
had
not
smith
removed
enough
of
the
weights
from
their
suits
to
offset
their
burden
they
reached
the
unopened
door
without
special
exertion
and
with
no
mishap
they
looked
in
vain
for
a
crack
big
enough
to
hold
the
point
of
the
crowbar
neither
could
the
most
vigorous
jabbing
loosen
any
of
the
material
they
dropped
that
tool
and
tried
the
sledge
it
got
no
results
even
in
the
hands
of
the
husky
geologist
the
most
vigorous
blows
failed
to
budge
the
door
they
did
not
even
dent
it
so
they
propped
the
powerful
hydraulic
jack
a
tool
sturdy
enough
to
lift
a
house
at
an
angle
against
the
door
then
using
the
crowbar
as
a
lever
the
architect
steadily
turned
up
the
screw
the
mechanism
multiplying
his
very
ordinary
strength
a
hundredfold
in
a
moment
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
getting
results
the
door
began
to
stir
van
emmon
struck
one
edge
with
the
and
it
gave
slightly
in
another
minute
the
whole
door
weighing
over
a
ton
had
been
pushed
almost
out
of
its
opening
the
jack
overbalanced
toppled
over
they
did
not
readjust
it
but
threw
their
combined
weight
upon
the
barrier
there
was
no
need
to
try
again
with
a
shiver
the
huge
slab
of
metal
slid
upright
into
the
space
beyond
stood
straight
on
end
for
a
second
or
so
then
toppled
to
the
floor
and
this
time
they
heard
the
crash
for
as
the
door
fell
a
great
gust
of
wind
rushed
out
with
a
hissing
shriek
almost
overbalancing
the
men
from
the
earth
they
stood
still
for
a
while
breathing
hard
from
their
exertion
trying
in
vain
to
peer
into
the
blackness
before
them
under
no
circumstances
would
either
of
them
have
admitted
that
he
was
gathering
courage
in
a
minute
the
architect
his
eyes
sparkling
with
his
enthusiasm
for
the
antique
picked
up
the
electric
torch
and
turned
it
into
the
compartment
as
he
did
so
the
other
two
stepped
to
his
side
so
that
the
three
of
them
faced
the
unknown
together
it
was
just
as
well
outlined
in
that
circle
of
light
and
not
six
feet
in
front
of
them
stood
a
great
chair
upon
a
wide
platform
and
seated
in
it
erect
and
alert
his
wide
open
eyes
staring
straight
into
those
of
the
three
was
the
frightful
mountainous
form
of
strokor
the
giant
himself
for
an
indeterminable
length
of
time
the
men
from
the
earth
stood
there
speechless
unbreathing
staring
at
that
awful
monster
as
though
at
a
nightmare
he
did
not
move
he
was
entirely
at
ease
and
yet
plainly
on
guard
glaring
at
them
with
an
air
of
conscious
superiority
which
held
them
powerless
instinctively
they
knew
that
the
voice
in
the
records
had
belonged
to
this
hercules
but
their
instinct
could
not
tell
them
whether
the
man
still
lived
it
was
the
doctor
brain
that
worked
first
automatically
from
a
lifelong
habit
of
diagnosis
he
inspected
that
dreadful
figure
quite
as
though
it
were
that
of
a
patient
bit
by
bit
his
subconscious
mind
pieced
together
the
evidence
the
man
in
the
chair
showed
no
signs
of
life
and
after
a
while
the
doctor
conscious
mind
also
knew
he
is
dead
he
said
positively
in
his
natural
voice
and
such
was
the
vast
relief
of
the
other
two
that
they
were
in
no
way
startled
by
the
sound
instantly
all
three
drew
long
breaths
the
tension
was
relaxed
and
van
emmon
curiosity
found
a
harsh
and
unsteady
voice
how
under
heaven
has
he
been
preserved
all
this
time
especially
he
added
remembering
considering
the
air
that
we
found
in
the
room
the
doctor
answered
after
a
moment
his
reply
taking
the
form
of
advancing
a
step
or
two
and
holding
out
a
hand
it
touched
glass
for
the
first
time
since
the
discovery
the
builder
shifted
the
light
he
had
held
it
as
still
as
death
for
a
full
minute
now
he
flashed
it
all
about
the
place
and
they
saw
that
the
huge
figure
was
entirely
encased
in
glass
the
cabinet
measured
about
six
feet
on
each
of
its
sides
and
about
five
feet
in
height
but
such
were
the
squat
proportions
of
the
occupant
that
he
filled
the
whole
space
a
slight
examination
showed
that
the
case
was
not
fixed
to
the
platform
but
had
a
separate
bottom
upon
which
the
stumplike
chair
was
set
also
they
found
that
thanks
to
the
reduced
pull
of
the
planet
it
was
not
hard
for
the
three
of
them
to
lift
the
cabinet
bodily
despite
its
weight
of
almost
a
thousand
pounds
they
left
the
tools
lie
there
discarded
as
much
weight
as
they
could
and
proceeded
to
carry
that
superman
out
into
the
light
here
they
could
see
that
the
great
man
was
all
but
a
negro
in
color
it
was
equally
clear
however
from
an
examination
of
his
mammoth
cranium
and
extraordinary
expression
that
he
was
as
highly
developed
along
most
mental
lines
as
the
greatest
men
on
earth
it
was
the
back
of
his
head
however
so
flat
that
it
was
only
a
continuation
of
his
neck
or
rather
shoulders
that
told
where
the
flaw
lay
that
together
with
the
hardness
of
his
eye
the
cruelty
of
his
mouth
and
the
absolute
lack
of
softness
anywhere
in
the
ironlike
face
or
frame
all
this
condemned
the
monster
for
what
he
was
inhuman
it
was
not
easy
to
get
him
down
the
two
flights
of
stairs
more
than
once
they
had
to
prop
the
case
on
a
step
while
they
rested
and
at
one
time
just
before
they
reached
that
curious
heap
of
rubbish
at
the
foot
of
the
upper
stairs
jackson
strength
gave
way
and
it
looked
as
though
the
whole
thing
would
get
away
from
them
van
emmon
saved
it
at
the
cost
of
a
bruised
shoulder
once
at
the
bottom
of
the
lower
flight
the
rest
was
easy
within
a
very
few
minutes
the
astonished
face
of
the
engineer
was
peering
into
the
vestibule
he
could
hardly
wait
until
the
door
was
locked
before
opening
the
inner
valves
he
stared
at
the
mammoth
figure
in
the
case
long
and
hard
and
from
then
on
showed
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
his
three
friends
of
course
at
that
time
the
members
of
the
expedition
did
not
understand
the
conditions
of
mercury
as
they
are
now
known
they
had
to
depend
upon
the
general
impression
they
got
from
their
investigations
and
it
is
remarkable
that
the
doctor
should
have
guessed
so
close
to
the
truth
he
must
have
made
up
his
mind
to
outlast
everybody
else
was
the
way
he
put
it
as
he
kicked
off
his
suit
he
stepped
up
to
the
cabinet
and
felt
of
the
glass
i
wish
it
were
possible
without
breaking
the
case
to
see
how
he
was
embalmed
his
fingers
still
rested
on
the
glass
suddenly
his
eyes
narrowed
he
ran
his
fingers
over
the
entire
surface
of
the
pane
and
then
whirled
to
stare
at
a
thermometer
that
mighty
curious
he
ejaculated
this
thing
was
bitter
cold
when
we
brought
it
in
now
it
already
as
warm
as
this
car
smith
eyes
lit
up
it
may
be
he
offered
that
the
case
contain
a
vacuum
but
some
gas
which
has
an
electrical
affinity
for
our
atmosphere
or
exclaimed
the
geologist
suddenly
the
glass
itself
may
be
totally
different
from
ours
it
may
be
made
of
god
shouted
the
doctor
jerking
his
hand
from
the
cabinet
and
leaping
straight
backward
at
the
same
instant
with
a
grinding
crash
all
three
sides
of
the
case
collapsed
and
fell
in
splinters
to
the
floor
look
out
shrieked
jackson
he
was
staring
straight
into
the
now
unhooded
eyes
of
the
giant
he
backed
away
stumbled
against
a
stool
and
fell
to
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
smith
fumbled
impotently
with
a
hammer
the
doctor
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
but
van
emmon
stood
still
in
his
tracks
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
goliath
his
fingernails
gashed
the
palms
of
his
hands
but
he
would
not
budge
and
as
he
stared
he
saw
from
first
to
last
the
whole
ghastly
change
that
came
after
billions
of
years
of
waiting
to
the
sole
survivor
of
mercury
a
glaze
swept
over
the
huge
figure
next
instant
every
line
in
that
adamant
frame
lost
its
strength
the
hardness
left
the
eyes
and
mouth
the
head
seemed
to
sink
lower
into
the
massive
shoulders
and
the
irresistible
hands
relaxed
in
another
second
the
thing
that
had
once
been
as
iron
had
become
as
rubber
but
only
for
an
instant
second
by
second
that
huge
mountain
of
muscle
slipped
and
jellied
and
actually
melted
before
the
eyes
of
the
humans
at
the
same
time
a
curious
acrid
odor
arose
smith
fell
to
coughing
the
doctor
turned
on
more
oxygen
in
less
than
half
a
minute
the
man
who
had
once
conquered
a
planet
was
reduced
to
a
steaming
mound
of
brownish
paste
as
it
sank
to
the
floor
of
the
case
it
touched
a
layer
of
coarse
yellow
powder
sprinkled
there
and
it
was
this
that
caused
the
vapor
in
a
moment
the
room
was
filled
with
the
haze
of
it
luckily
the
doctor
apparatus
worked
well
and
thus
it
came
about
that
within
five
minutes
from
being
exposed
to
the
air
of
the
that
whole
immense
bulk
chair
and
all
had
vanished
the
powder
had
turned
it
to
vapor
and
the
purifying
chemicals
had
sucked
it
up
nothing
was
left
save
a
heap
of
smoking
grayish
ashes
in
the
center
of
the
broken
glass
van
emmon
fingers
relaxed
their
grip
he
stirred
to
action
and
turned
briskly
to
smith
here
help
me
with
this
thing
between
them
they
got
the
remains
of
the
cabinet
with
its
gruesome
load
into
the
vestibule
as
for
the
doctor
he
was
bending
over
jackson
still
unconscious
form
when
he
saw
what
the
others
were
doing
he
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
good
he
helped
them
close
the
door
let
get
away
from
this
damned
place
the
outer
door
was
opened
at
the
same
time
smith
started
the
machinery
and
as
the
shot
away
from
the
ground
he
tilted
it
slightly
so
that
the
contents
of
the
vestibule
was
slid
into
space
down
it
fell
like
so
much
lead
the
doctor
glanced
through
a
nearby
window
and
his
face
brightened
as
he
made
out
the
distant
gleam
of
another
planet
he
watched
the
receding
surface
of
mercury
with
positive
delight
nice
place
to
get
away
from
he
commented
and
now
my
friends
for
venus
and
then
home
but
the
other
eyes
were
fixed
upon
a
tiny
sparkle
in
the
dust
outside
the
palace
where
the
vestibule
had
dropped
its
load
it
was
the
sun
shining
upon
some
broken
bits
of
glass
the
glass
which
for
untold
ages
had
enclosed
the
throne
of
the
part
iv
the
queen
of
life
i
next
stop
venus
when
he
first
got
the
idea
of
the
the
doctor
never
stopped
to
consider
whether
he
was
the
right
man
for
such
an
excursion
personally
he
hated
travel
he
was
merely
a
general
practitioner
with
a
great
fondness
for
astronomy
and
the
sole
reason
why
he
wanted
to
visit
the
planets
was
that
he
could
see
them
well
enough
with
his
telescope
so
he
dabbled
a
little
in
magnetism
and
so
forth
and
stumbled
upon
the
principle
of
the
cube
but
he
had
no
mechanical
ability
and
was
on
the
point
of
giving
up
the
scheme
when
he
met
smith
he
was
instantly
impressed
by
the
highly
commonplace
face
he
had
had
considerable
experience
with
human
contrariness
and
felt
sure
that
smith
must
be
an
absolute
wonder
since
he
looked
so
very
ordinary
kinney
diagnosis
proved
correct
smith
knew
his
business
the
machinery
was
finished
in
a
hurry
and
done
right
however
when
it
came
to
fitting
the
outfit
into
a
suitable
kinney
was
obliged
to
call
in
an
architect
that
accounts
for
williams
jackson
at
the
same
time
it
occurred
to
the
doctor
that
they
would
need
a
cook
kinney
had
refused
to
have
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
trip
and
so
kinney
put
an
ad
in
the
paper
as
luck
would
have
it
van
emmon
the
geologist
who
had
learned
how
to
cook
when
he
first
became
a
mountaineer
saw
the
ad
and
answered
it
in
hope
of
adventure
the
doctor
himself
besides
his
training
in
the
mental
and
bodily
frailities
of
human
beings
had
also
an
unusual
command
of
the
related
sciences
such
as
biology
smith
specialties
have
already
been
named
he
could
drive
an
airplane
or
a
nail
with
equal
ease
van
emmon
as
a
part
of
his
profession
was
a
skilled
fossilologist
and
was
well
up
in
natural
history
as
for
williams
jackson
the
architect
was
also
the
sociologist
of
the
four
moreover
he
had
quite
a
reputation
as
an
amateur
antiquarian
nevertheless
the
most
important
thing
about
williams
jackson
was
not
learned
until
after
the
visit
to
mercury
after
the
terrible
end
of
that
exploration
after
the
architect
falling
in
a
faint
had
been
revived
under
the
doctor
care
gentlemen
said
kinney
coming
from
the
secluded
nook
among
the
dynamos
which
had
been
the
architect
bunk
gentlemen
i
must
inform
you
that
jackson
is
not
what
we
thought
he
i
mean
she
is
a
woman
which
put
an
entirely
new
face
upon
matters
the
three
men
discussing
it
marveled
that
the
architect
had
been
able
to
keep
her
sex
a
secret
all
the
time
they
were
exploring
at
mercury
they
did
not
know
that
none
of
williams
jackson
fellow
architects
had
ever
guessed
the
truth
ambitious
and
ingenious
with
a
natural
liking
for
she
had
resolved
that
her
sex
should
not
stand
in
the
way
of
success
and
when
she
finally
came
to
herself
there
in
her
bunk
and
suspected
that
her
secret
was
out
instead
of
shame
or
embarrassment
she
felt
only
chagrin
she
walked
rather
unsteadily
across
the
floor
of
the
great
car
to
the
window
where
the
three
were
standing
and
as
they
quietly
made
a
place
for
her
she
took
it
entirely
as
a
matter
of
course
and
without
a
word
the
doctor
had
been
speaking
of
the
peculiar
fitness
of
the
four
for
what
they
were
doing
and
if
i
not
mistaken
he
went
on
going
to
need
all
the
brains
we
can
pool
when
we
get
to
venus
i
never
would
have
claimed
when
we
started
out
that
mercury
had
ever
been
inhabited
but
now
that
we
seen
what
we
seen
i
feel
dead
sure
that
venus
once
was
peopled
the
four
looked
out
the
window
at
the
steadily
growing
globe
of
earth
twin
sister
half
in
sunlight
and
half
in
shadow
this
planet
for
ages
the
synonym
for
beauty
was
now
but
a
million
miles
away
she
looked
as
large
as
the
moon
but
instead
of
a
silvery
gleam
she
showed
a
creamy
radiance
fully
three
times
as
bright
let
see
reflected
the
geologist
aloud
as
i
recall
it
the
brightness
of
a
planet
depends
upon
the
amount
of
its
air
that
would
indicate
then
that
venus
has
about
as
much
as
the
earth
would
it
remembering
how
the
home
planet
had
looked
when
they
left
it
the
doctor
nodded
there
are
other
factors
but
undoubtedly
we
are
approaching
a
world
which
is
a
great
deal
like
our
own
venus
is
nearly
as
large
as
the
earth
has
about
the
surface
and
a
gravity
almost
as
strong
the
main
difference
is
that
she
only
as
far
from
the
sun
as
we
are
how
long
is
her
day
smith
wanted
to
know
ca
say
some
observers
claim
to
have
seen
her
clearly
enough
to
announce
a
day
of
the
same
length
as
ours
others
calculate
that
like
mercury
always
the
same
face
toward
the
sun
if
so
her
day
is
also
her
year
two
hundred
and
of
our
days
van
emmon
looked
disappointed
in
that
case
she
would
be
blistering
hot
on
one
side
and
freezing
cold
on
the
other
except
remembering
mercury
except
for
the
zone
where
the
climate
would
be
neither
one
nor
the
other
but
temperate
he
pointed
to
the
line
down
the
middle
of
the
disk
before
them
the
line
which
divided
the
lighted
from
the
unlighted
the
day
from
the
night
the
four
looked
more
intently
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
very
brilliance
of
venus
has
always
hindered
the
astronomers
the
planet
as
a
whole
is
always
very
conspicuous
but
its
very
glare
makes
it
impossible
to
see
any
details
the
surface
has
always
seemed
to
be
covered
by
a
veil
of
hazy
faintly
streaked
vapor
smith
gave
a
queer
exclamation
for
a
moment
or
two
he
stared
hard
at
the
planet
then
looked
up
with
an
apologetic
grin
i
had
a
foolish
idea
i
thought
he
checked
himself
say
venus
remind
you
of
something
the
doctor
slowly
shook
his
head
ca
say
that
it
does
smith
i
have
always
considered
venus
as
having
an
appearance
peculiarly
her
own
why
the
engineer
started
to
answer
stopped
thought
better
of
it
and
instead
pointed
out
the
half
that
was
in
shadow
why
is
it
that
we
can
make
out
the
black
portion
so
easily
kinney
could
answer
this
the
fact
is
it
is
really
black
at
all
but
faintly
lighted
presumably
it
is
echoed
the
architect
interested
just
that
you
see
finished
the
doctor
if
that
side
is
never
turned
toward
the
sun
then
it
must
be
covered
with
ice
which
would
reflect
the
star
ah
exclaimed
smith
with
satisfaction
i
was
so
crazy
after
all
my
notion
was
that
the
whole
blamed
thing
is
covered
with
ice
it
looked
reasonable
certainly
the
entire
sphere
had
a
somewhat
watery
appearance
it
prompted
the
geologist
to
say
kinney
if
that
reflection
is
really
due
to
ice
then
there
must
be
plenty
of
water
vapor
in
the
air
and
if
that
the
case
not
only
is
life
entirely
possible
stated
the
doctor
quietly
but
i
bet
you
this
against
an
abandoned
mine
that
we
find
humans
or
beings
there
when
we
land
tomorrow
ii
speaking
of
venus
the
architect
was
still
dressed
in
the
fashionably
cut
suit
of
clothes
she
had
worn
while
in
the
car
van
emmon
thought
of
this
when
he
said
somewhat
awkwardly
well
i
going
to
fix
something
to
eat
it
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
miss
er
jackson
she
looked
at
him
slightly
puzzled
then
understood
you
mean
to
give
me
time
to
change
my
clothes
thanks
but
i
used
to
these
and
besides
with
spirit
i
never
could
see
why
women
could
wear
what
they
choose
so
long
as
it
is
decent
there
was
no
denying
that
hers
were
both
becoming
and
decent
modeled
after
the
usual
riding
costume
both
coat
and
breeches
were
youthfully
rather
than
mannishly
tailored
and
the
narrow
vertical
stripe
of
the
dark
gray
material
served
to
make
her
slenderness
almost
girlish
in
short
what
with
her
hair
her
independent
manner
and
direct
speech
she
was
far
more
like
a
boy
of
twenty
than
a
woman
nearing
thirty
she
walked
with
van
emmon
dodging
machinery
all
the
way
across
the
big
car
to
the
little
kitchenette
over
which
he
had
presided
there
to
his
dismay
the
girl
took
off
her
coat
rolled
up
her
sleeves
and
announced
her
intention
of
helping
you
a
good
cook
van
i
mean
let
it
go
at
van
please
said
he
hastily
my
first
name
is
gustave
but
nobody
has
ever
used
it
since
i
was
christened
same
with
my
she
declared
mother
name
was
williams
and
i
was
nicknamed
before
i
can
remember
so
that
settled
with
great
firmness
the
point
is
van
you
a
good
cook
but
everything
tastes
of
bacon
i
wish
you
let
me
boss
this
meal
he
looked
rebellious
for
an
instant
then
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
really
tickled
to
death
a
little
later
the
doctor
and
smith
looking
across
saw
van
emmon
being
initiated
into
the
system
which
constructs
scalloped
potatoes
next
he
was
discovering
that
there
is
more
than
one
way
to
prepare
dried
beef
for
once
we
wo
cream
it
said
billie
jackson
dryly
as
van
emmon
laid
down
the
we
make
an
omelet
out
of
it
and
see
if
anything
happens
she
was
already
beating
the
eggs
he
cut
up
the
meat
into
small
pieces
and
when
he
was
finished
took
the
away
from
her
he
turned
it
so
energetically
that
a
speck
of
foam
flew
into
his
face
go
slow
she
advised
nonchalantly
reaching
up
with
a
and
wiping
the
fleck
away
whereupon
he
worked
the
machine
more
furiously
than
ever
soon
he
was
wondering
how
on
earth
he
had
come
to
assume
all
along
that
she
was
not
a
woman
he
now
saw
that
what
he
had
previously
considered
boyishness
in
her
was
in
fact
simply
the
vigor
and
freshness
of
an
earnest
healthy
energetic
girl
it
dawned
upon
him
that
her
keen
gray
eyes
were
not
sharp
but
alert
her
mouth
not
hard
but
resolute
her
whole
expression
instead
of
mannish
just
as
womanly
as
that
of
any
girl
who
has
been
thrown
upon
her
own
resources
and
made
good
he
soon
found
that
his
eyesight
did
not
suffer
in
any
way
because
he
looked
at
her
now
she
remarked
in
her
businesslike
way
as
she
placed
the
brimming
pan
into
the
oven
i
suppose
that
i
hear
various
hints
to
the
effect
that
a
woman
has
no
business
trying
to
do
men
stunts
and
i
warn
you
right
now
that
i
prepared
to
put
up
a
warm
argument
of
course
said
the
geologist
with
such
gravity
that
the
girl
knew
he
did
mean
it
of
course
a
woman
place
is
in
the
home
surrounded
by
seventeen
or
eighteen
children
and
cooking
for
that
many
more
hired
men
besides
she
is
simply
ideal
we
realize
that
then
admitting
that
much
why
should
a
woman
be
as
independent
as
she
likes
think
what
women
did
during
the
war
remember
what
a
lot
of
women
are
doctors
and
lawyers
is
there
any
good
reason
why
i
design
a
library
as
well
as
a
man
could
none
at
all
agreed
van
emmon
handing
over
the
dish
of
chopped
meat
the
girl
carefully
folded
the
contents
into
the
now
spongelike
omelet
as
he
went
on
by
the
way
a
neighbor
of
mine
told
me
just
before
i
left
that
he
was
having
trouble
with
a
broken
sewer
how
you
like
to
about
as
well
as
you
like
to
darn
socks
she
came
back
evidently
being
primed
for
such
comments
she
took
a
look
at
the
potatoes
and
then
permitted
the
geologist
to
open
their
sixth
can
of
peaches
i
must
say
they
good
she
admitted
as
she
noted
the
eagerness
with
which
he
obeyed
bread
and
butter
olives
coffee
and
cake
completed
that
meal
the
table
was
set
with
more
care
than
usual
a
clean
cloth
and
napkins
being
unearthed
for
the
occasion
when
smith
and
kinney
were
called
both
declared
that
they
were
hungry
enough
to
do
justice
to
it
all
it
just
as
well
you
were
very
hungry
commented
billie
as
she
finished
giving
each
of
them
a
second
helping
of
the
potatoes
barely
enough
left
for
me
and
she
took
it
say
i
never
thought
of
it
before
miss
er
miss
billie
said
smith
coloring
but
you
eat
just
as
much
as
a
man
ye
gods
how
shocking
she
jeered
come
to
think
of
it
smith
you
eat
more
than
a
woman
the
doctor
face
grew
red
with
some
suppressed
emotion
after
a
while
he
said
soberly
i
tell
you
what
worrying
smith
he
afraid
that
women
having
suddenly
become
very
progressive
will
forge
entirely
ahead
of
men
you
understand
having
started
they
ca
stop
and
i
must
admit
that
i
thought
seriously
of
it
at
times
myself
me
too
added
van
emmon
earnestly
i
have
the
same
feeling
about
it
that
an
elderly
man
must
have
when
he
sees
a
young
one
get
on
the
job
instead
of
being
glad
that
the
women
are
making
good
i
sort
of
resent
it
i
knew
it
exclaimed
the
girl
delightedly
but
i
never
heard
a
man
admit
it
before
perhaps
it
is
as
serious
as
we
think
said
the
practical
smith
scraping
the
bottom
of
the
potato
pan
i
believe
that
the
progress
of
women
may
have
a
fine
effect
upon
men
making
us
less
and
more
alert
for
one
thing
glancing
about
the
cube
we
got
to
clean
up
a
bit
now
that
we
know
you
a
woman
the
architect
eyes
flashed
because
you
know
mighty
well
i
light
in
and
do
it
myself
if
you
do
that
what
you
mean
please
take
notice
that
i
to
be
respected
not
because
of
what
i
am
but
because
of
what
i
can
do
in
behalf
of
myself
and
companions
i
surrender
said
the
doctor
gallantly
then
he
instantly
added
and
yet
even
when
we
are
actually
chivalrous
we
are
disregarding
your
desire
to
be
appreciated
for
what
you
are
worth
pardon
me
miss
billie
i
not
forget
again
at
the
same
time
my
dear
remembering
that
he
had
a
daughter
of
his
own
nearly
the
builder
age
we
men
have
come
to
think
of
women
primarily
as
potential
mothers
and
secondarily
as
people
of
affairs
and
considering
that
motherhood
is
something
that
is
denied
to
us
lords
of
the
earth
for
which
we
can
thank
a
merciful
providence
interjected
the
girl
solemnly
considering
this
excuse
my
seriousness
really
amazing
fact
you
blame
us
for
expecting
women
to
fulfil
this
vital
function
before
taking
up
other
matters
yes
remarked
the
girl
watching
the
peaches
with
anxious
eye
as
van
emmon
helped
himself
funny
but
i
always
understood
that
the
first
function
of
man
was
to
father
the
race
yet
invariably
the
young
fellows
try
to
make
names
for
themselves
before
not
after
they
marry
scalped
chuckled
van
emmon
as
the
doctor
hid
his
discomfiture
behind
a
large
piece
of
cake
you
may
know
a
lot
about
venus
doc
but
you
do
know
much
about
women
speaking
about
venus
smith
was
reminded
we
may
learn
something
bearing
upon
the
very
point
we
have
been
discussing
if
kinney
right
about
the
inhabitants
the
doctor
nodded
eagerly
you
see
if
there
people
still
alive
on
the
planet
they
probably
further
advanced
than
we
on
the
earth
other
things
being
equal
of
course
being
a
smaller
planet
than
ours
she
cooled
off
sooner
and
thus
became
fit
for
life
earlier
and
having
been
made
from
the
same
to
use
van
expression
that
mercury
and
all
the
rest
were
why
in
all
likelihood
evolution
has
taken
place
there
much
the
same
as
with
us
only
sooner
i
should
expect
he
elaborated
largely
that
we
shall
find
the
inhabitants
much
the
same
as
we
humans
only
extremely
civilized
it
may
be
that
they
are
as
far
above
us
as
we
are
above
monkeys
smith
broke
in
by
quoting
an
astronomer
who
contended
that
venus
kept
only
one
face
toward
the
sun
maybe
she
always
did
kinney
the
doctor
shook
his
head
see
how
perfectly
round
she
is
no
oblateness
whatever
it
proves
that
she
once
revolved
otherwise
be
from
the
sun
pull
there
was
a
short
silence
during
which
billie
concluded
that
the
only
scraps
left
would
be
the
then
van
emmon
pushed
away
from
the
table
got
to
his
feet
stretched
a
little
to
relieve
his
nerves
and
said
well
whatever
we
find
on
venus
i
hope
the
women
do
the
cooking
iii
the
first
venusian
when
the
was
within
a
thousand
miles
of
the
surface
smith
adjusted
the
currents
so
that
the
floor
was
directed
downward
the
four
changed
from
the
window
to
the
deadlight
and
watched
the
approaching
disk
with
every
bit
of
the
excitement
and
interest
they
had
felt
when
nearing
mercury
the
doctor
had
warned
them
that
the
heavy
atmosphere
which
venus
was
known
to
possess
would
prevent
seeing
as
clearly
as
in
the
case
of
the
smaller
planet
all
were
much
disappointed
however
to
find
that
they
were
still
unable
to
make
out
a
single
definite
detail
the
great
shining
world
showed
nothing
but
that
vaguely
streaked
like
haze
there
was
something
very
queer
about
it
all
strange
that
we
should
see
no
movement
in
those
clouds
mused
the
doctor
aloud
that
is
if
they
really
are
clouds
van
emmon
already
doubted
it
just
what
i
was
thinking
there
ought
to
be
terrific
winds
yet
so
far
as
i
have
seen
there
been
nothing
doing
anywhere
on
the
surface
since
we
first
began
to
observe
it
after
a
while
the
doctor
put
away
his
binoculars
and
rubbed
his
eyes
we
might
as
well
descend
faster
smith
ca
see
a
thing
from
here
unhindered
by
air
to
impede
its
progress
the
had
been
hurtling
through
space
at
cometary
speed
now
however
smith
added
the
power
of
the
apparatus
to
the
pull
of
the
planet
so
that
the
disk
began
to
rush
toward
them
at
a
truly
alarming
rate
after
a
few
seconds
of
it
billie
found
herself
unconsciously
moving
to
the
side
of
the
geologist
he
looked
down
at
her
understood
and
flushed
with
pleasure
no
danger
he
confidently
assured
her
with
the
result
that
her
courage
fortified
the
girl
moved
back
to
her
place
again
van
emmon
inwardly
kicked
himself
so
deceptive
was
that
peculiar
fogginess
smith
throttled
their
descent
as
soon
as
they
had
reached
the
point
where
the
planet
appearance
changed
from
round
to
flat
they
were
headed
for
the
line
which
marked
the
boundary
of
the
shadow
this
gray
twilight
zone
was
three
or
four
hundred
miles
in
width
on
the
right
of
it
to
the
east
the
dazzling
surface
of
that
sunlit
vapor
contrasted
sharply
with
the
all
but
black
mistiness
of
the
starward
side
clearly
the
zone
ought
to
be
temperate
enough
down
they
sank
as
they
came
nearer
a
curious
pinkish
tint
began
to
show
beneath
them
shortly
it
became
more
noticeable
the
doctor
gave
a
sudden
grunt
of
satisfaction
and
smith
stopped
the
car
a
minute
later
the
doctor
had
taken
a
sample
of
the
surrounding
ether
through
his
laboratory
and
shortly
announced
that
they
were
now
floating
in
air
instead
of
space
good
deal
like
ours
back
home
too
exultingly
pretty
thin
of
course
he
made
a
short
calculation
referring
to
the
aneroid
barometer
which
was
mounted
on
the
outer
frame
of
a
window
and
said
he
judged
that
their
altitude
was
about
five
miles
the
descent
continued
smith
using
the
utmost
caution
the
other
three
kept
their
eyes
glued
to
the
deadlight
and
their
mystification
was
only
equaled
by
their
uneasiness
as
that
motionless
bleary
glaze
failed
absolutely
to
show
anything
they
had
not
seen
a
thousand
miles
higher
not
a
single
detail
it
reminds
me
said
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
of
something
i
once
saw
from
the
top
of
a
hill
it
was
the
reflection
of
the
sun
from
the
surface
of
a
pond
not
clear
water
but
covered
with
good
heavens
interrupted
van
emmon
struck
with
the
thought
can
it
be
that
the
whole
planet
is
under
water
beyond
a
doubt
his
guess
was
justified
there
was
an
oily
smoothness
about
that
dazzling
haze
which
made
it
remarkably
like
a
lake
of
still
and
rather
dirty
water
under
a
bright
sun
but
the
doctor
said
no
any
water
i
ever
heard
of
would
make
clouds
said
he
and
we
know
there
air
enough
to
guarantee
plenty
of
wind
yet
nothing
seems
to
be
in
motion
he
was
frowning
continually
now
it
was
billie
who
first
declared
that
she
saw
the
surface
stop
she
said
to
smith
evenly
and
he
instantly
obeyed
all
four
gathered
around
the
deadlight
and
soon
agreed
that
the
peculiarly
elusive
skin
of
the
planet
was
actually
within
sight
however
it
was
like
deciding
upon
the
distance
of
the
moon
as
easy
to
say
that
it
were
within
arm
reach
as
a
long
ways
off
the
doctor
went
to
a
window
there
he
could
look
out
upon
the
sun
a
painfully
bright
object
much
larger
than
it
looks
from
the
earth
it
was
just
ascending
and
half
of
it
was
below
the
horizon
a
blinding
streak
of
light
was
reflected
from
a
point
on
the
surface
not
far
from
the
cube
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
the
doctor
could
see
that
the
mysterious
crust
was
absolutely
smooth
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
car
the
horizon
ended
in
a
sunrise
glow
of
a
slightly
greenish
radiance
from
that
side
the
pinkish
tint
of
the
surface
was
quite
pronounced
before
going
any
lower
the
doctor
struck
with
an
idea
declared
we
always
want
to
remember
that
this
car
is
perfectly
soundproof
suppose
we
open
the
outer
door
of
the
vestibule
i
imagine
we
learn
something
peculiar
it
was
possible
to
open
this
door
without
touching
the
inner
valves
using
mechanism
concealed
within
the
walls
the
moment
it
was
done
the
door
faced
the
north
pandemonium
itself
broke
loose
a
most
terrific
shrieking
and
howling
came
from
the
outside
it
was
wind
passing
at
a
rate
such
as
would
make
a
hurricane
seem
a
mere
zephyr
the
doctor
closed
the
door
so
that
they
could
think
it
the
draft
he
concluded
the
draft
from
the
side
to
the
cold
side
as
for
van
emmon
he
was
getting
out
a
rope
and
a
heavy
leaden
weight
on
the
rope
he
formed
knots
every
five
feet
about
twenty
of
them
and
after
getting
into
one
of
the
insulated
and
helmeted
suits
with
which
they
had
explored
mercury
he
locked
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
inner
vestibule
door
and
proceeded
to
sound
to
the
amazement
of
all
except
billie
bottom
was
reached
in
less
than
twenty
feet
i
thought
so
she
said
with
satisfaction
but
she
was
not
at
ease
until
van
emmon
had
returned
in
safety
from
that
booming
whistling
turmoil
his
first
remark
upon
removing
his
helmet
almost
took
them
off
their
feet
the
point
is
said
he
throttling
his
excitement
the
point
is
the
rope
was
nearly
jerked
out
of
my
hands
understand
what
i
mean
the
surface
is
revolving
this
upset
every
idea
they
had
had
it
never
occurred
to
any
of
them
that
the
planet
could
revolve
at
such
speed
that
it
would
appear
stationary
smith
went
at
once
to
the
eastern
window
and
watched
closely
for
fear
some
irregularity
in
that
apparently
perfect
sphere
might
catch
them
unawares
they
did
not
learn
till
later
that
day
is
a
little
less
than
hours
and
therefore
since
they
had
approached
her
near
the
equator
the
wind
they
had
encountered
was
moving
at
nearly
nine
hundred
miles
per
hour
bit
by
bit
though
the
cube
answered
to
the
soon
they
noted
the
sun
rising
slowly
and
by
the
time
it
was
two
hours
high
the
surface
which
had
been
whizzing
under
them
like
some
highly
polished
top
became
entirely
motionless
the
cube
had
stopped
one
minute
later
the
car
touched
the
level
smith
very
slowly
reduced
the
repelling
current
so
that
the
immense
weight
of
the
cube
was
but
gradually
shifted
to
the
unknown
surface
beneath
ton
after
ton
was
added
until
stop
came
from
the
doctor
he
had
noted
through
the
window
a
slight
curvature
in
the
material
so
the
machinery
was
left
in
action
at
any
rate
said
smith
we
know
that
the
confounded
stuff
is
antimagnetic
whatever
it
is
of
course
this
was
true
even
though
the
gelatinlike
shell
could
not
support
the
cube
weight
yet
it
did
not
insulate
the
planet
from
the
repelling
current
the
thermometer
registered
three
hundred
and
degrees
fahrenheit
two
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
higher
than
it
would
be
at
home
in
the
same
latitude
remarked
the
doctor
we
have
to
use
the
suits
he
took
it
for
granted
that
exploration
should
begin
at
once
no
one
stayed
behind
the
machines
could
be
relied
upon
as
they
knew
from
nearly
two
weeks
of
use
and
certainly
there
was
nothing
in
sight
which
could
possibly
interfere
with
the
cube
nevertheless
the
engineer
took
care
to
remove
part
of
the
apparatus
when
he
left
the
vestibule
and
nobody
commented
upon
it
it
seemed
the
sensible
thing
to
do
that
was
all
there
was
just
about
enough
additional
weight
in
their
suits
to
balance
the
slightly
reduced
gravitation
so
they
moved
about
four
misshapen
metallic
hulks
with
as
much
freedom
as
though
back
home
always
they
kept
within
a
few
feet
of
each
other
so
as
to
throw
no
strain
on
their
interconnecting
telephone
wires
the
big
helmets
gave
a
remarkable
sense
of
security
they
made
a
complete
circuit
of
the
cube
and
at
the
end
of
it
looked
at
each
other
in
perplexity
never
save
in
the
middle
of
an
ocean
in
the
doldrums
did
any
man
ever
see
such
a
totally
barren
spot
not
a
tree
much
less
a
sign
of
human
occupation
there
was
not
even
the
slightest
mound
the
planet
was
in
actual
fact
as
smooth
and
as
bare
as
a
billiard
ball
moreover
the
surface
itself
remained
as
mysterious
as
before
of
course
they
did
not
touch
it
with
bare
hands
all
wore
insulated
mittens
but
the
dazzling
stuff
was
certainly
as
hard
as
steel
and
as
highly
polished
it
was
neither
transparent
nor
opaque
but
translucent
like
pink
as
billie
suggested
she
was
the
first
to
propose
that
they
move
to
another
spot
we
ought
to
try
a
place
where
it
not
yet
dawn
said
she
shielding
her
eyes
from
the
glare
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
suits
protected
them
from
the
heat
itself
ca
see
anything
hush
hissed
the
doctor
they
turned
and
followed
his
gaze
to
a
spot
not
thirty
feet
from
where
they
stood
at
the
same
instant
they
felt
a
faint
jar
in
the
material
under
their
feet
and
next
second
they
saw
that
a
large
section
of
the
supposedly
solid
surface
was
in
motion
a
portion
about
ten
feet
square
was
being
lifted
bodily
in
front
of
their
eyes
and
before
another
word
was
said
this
block
of
the
unknown
substance
was
raised
until
they
could
see
that
it
was
all
of
a
yard
thick
up
it
went
at
the
same
deliberate
rate
and
the
four
involuntarily
moved
closer
together
as
they
saw
that
there
was
something
underneath
it
was
a
cage
for
all
the
world
like
that
of
an
elevator
except
that
it
was
made
of
clear
glass
another
second
and
it
had
stopped
with
its
floor
level
with
the
surface
and
the
people
from
the
earth
saw
that
it
contained
a
man
he
was
quite
tall
slenderly
built
and
dressed
in
a
queer
satiny
material
which
fitted
him
like
an
acrobat
suit
he
was
extremely
thin
as
to
legs
narrow
as
to
shoulders
deep
in
the
chest
and
short
in
the
waist
all
this
however
they
saw
after
their
inspection
of
his
head
it
was
human
marvelously
refined
in
every
detail
yet
it
was
set
upon
a
graceful
neck
and
modeled
upon
much
the
same
lines
as
that
of
any
man
it
was
not
that
of
a
brute
nor
yet
that
of
a
bird
it
was
human
he
stood
at
ease
resting
slightly
on
one
foot
and
dispelled
any
notion
that
he
might
be
unreal
by
shifting
his
weight
occasionally
meanwhile
he
watched
the
four
with
a
grave
interested
smile
and
they
in
turn
came
closer
his
chin
was
small
even
retreating
but
his
mouth
was
wide
and
curved
into
an
exaggerated
cupid
bow
even
as
he
continued
to
smile
the
curves
did
not
leave
his
lips
they
however
were
thin
rather
than
thick
his
nose
was
quite
small
with
a
decidedly
irish
cast
but
his
eyes
set
far
apart
above
quite
shallow
cheekbones
were
exceedingly
large
and
of
a
brilliant
blue
in
fact
it
was
mainly
his
eyes
that
gave
character
to
his
face
although
none
could
overlook
his
breadth
of
forehead
running
back
to
a
cranium
that
fairly
bulged
over
the
ears
and
seemed
ready
to
rise
like
a
tightly
inflated
balloon
his
skin
was
pure
white
and
so
they
stood
for
uncounted
minutes
at
last
the
doctor
noted
that
the
stranger
was
eying
them
with
far
less
interest
than
they
showed
in
him
he
stood
as
though
he
felt
on
display
and
the
doctor
gave
an
exclamation
of
perplexity
that
broke
the
spell
the
four
impulsively
drew
up
to
the
glass
van
emmon
touched
it
with
his
mitten
and
that
is
how
the
four
explorers
came
to
receive
the
vibrations
that
came
next
for
the
man
in
the
cage
in
turn
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
the
glass
opposite
van
emmon
then
he
opened
his
mouth
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
said
he
in
a
soft
pulsating
voice
and
in
the
best
of
english
iv
a
puzzled
world
for
a
moment
blank
amazement
gripped
the
four
then
amazement
gave
way
to
genuine
apprehension
were
they
insane
to
imagine
that
this
man
of
another
world
had
spoken
to
them
in
their
own
language
each
looked
at
the
other
and
was
astounded
to
see
that
all
had
heard
the
same
thing
presently
the
stranger
spoke
again
if
anything
the
kindly
smile
on
his
face
became
even
broader
suppose
we
postpone
explaining
how
i
am
able
to
use
your
tongue
it
will
be
easier
for
you
to
understand
after
you
have
been
with
us
a
while
he
spoke
slowly
and
carefully
yet
with
a
faint
lisp
much
as
some
infant
prodigy
might
speak
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
had
really
done
it
the
doctor
managed
to
clear
his
throat
you
are
right
said
he
with
vastly
less
assurance
than
the
amazing
stranger
we
will
try
to
understand
things
in
the
order
you
think
best
to
present
them
you
should
know
best
kinney
introduced
himself
by
name
and
profession
also
the
other
three
the
stranger
nodded
affably
to
each
you
may
call
me
estra
said
he
pronouncing
it
ethtra
there
is
no
occupation
on
the
earth
corresponding
with
mine
but
in
my
spare
moments
i
am
an
astronomer
like
yourself
the
doctor
silently
marveled
he
had
not
told
the
stranger
about
his
hobby
meanwhile
the
architect
attempted
to
break
the
ice
even
finer
we
take
it
for
granted
said
she
rather
nervously
that
your
people
are
somewhat
further
advanced
than
us
on
the
earth
however
we
expect
to
be
given
credit
for
having
visited
your
planet
before
you
visited
ours
she
said
this
with
an
engaging
smile
which
won
an
instant
response
the
venusian
lips
almost
lost
their
curves
in
his
generous
effort
you
will
find
that
we
greatly
respect
all
that
you
have
accomplished
he
declared
earnestly
as
for
your
apparatus
glancing
at
the
cube
you
have
the
advantage
on
the
earth
of
certain
chemical
elements
which
are
entirely
lacking
here
otherwise
we
should
have
called
upon
you
long
ago
he
slipped
a
panel
of
glass
to
one
side
step
in
quickly
he
exclaimed
gasping
and
the
four
obeyed
him
without
thought
it
was
only
when
the
panel
was
replaced
that
they
noticed
the
floor
of
the
cage
it
was
of
clear
glass
like
the
sides
and
looked
totally
incapable
of
bearing
their
combined
weight
the
venusian
smiled
at
smith
worried
look
the
material
is
amply
strong
enough
said
he
i
am
only
concerned
about
your
machine
there
is
it
safe
to
be
left
alone
so
far
as
we
know
yes
answered
van
emmon
who
did
not
feel
quite
as
much
confidence
in
the
stranger
as
the
rest
then
we
can
go
down
at
once
with
these
words
the
man
in
satin
turned
to
a
small
black
box
in
one
wall
of
the
elevator
and
touched
a
button
footnote
for
details
of
this
and
other
matters
of
an
electrical
and
mechanical
nature
the
technical
reader
is
referred
to
reports
to
the
instantly
the
car
began
to
descend
at
first
slowly
and
then
with
swiftly
increasing
velocity
by
the
time
the
explorers
had
accustomed
their
eyes
to
the
sudden
the
cage
was
dropping
at
such
a
speed
that
the
air
fairly
sang
past
its
sides
far
overhead
was
a
square
black
shadow
in
the
waxlike
crust
which
they
had
left
it
was
the
shadow
of
the
cube
all
about
them
was
a
dimly
lit
network
of
braces
arches
and
semitransparent
columns
to
all
appearances
the
system
seemed
to
support
the
crust
billie
whirled
upon
the
venusian
i
got
it
now
the
whole
globe
is
covered
with
glass
estra
smiled
his
approval
for
thousands
upon
thousands
of
centuries
my
friend
the
thing
was
done
when
our
ancestors
first
suspected
that
our
planet
was
doomed
to
come
so
near
the
sun
it
was
the
only
way
we
could
protect
ourselves
from
the
heat
great
exploded
the
doctor
admiration
overcoming
regret
that
he
had
not
thought
of
it
himself
but
smith
had
other
thoughts
how
long
did
it
take
to
finish
the
job
and
what
did
it
cost
two
centuries
and
about
twice
the
cost
of
your
last
war
i
need
only
suggest
to
you
that
we
colored
the
material
so
as
to
reflect
most
of
the
heat
that
is
why
the
material
looks
blue
from
below
although
pink
from
above
say
from
billie
how
long
are
we
to
keep
on
dropping
like
this
we
will
arrive
in
a
moment
or
two
answered
the
smiling
one
the
roof
is
raised
several
miles
above
the
in
order
to
cover
all
the
mountains
by
this
time
the
four
were
able
to
make
out
things
pretty
well
they
saw
that
the
dimness
was
only
relative
the
venusian
world
was
actually
as
well
lighted
as
any
part
of
the
earth
on
a
cloudy
day
and
they
saw
that
they
were
descending
in
a
locality
of
astonishing
beauty
the
stranger
halted
the
car
so
that
they
could
inspect
the
scene
as
though
from
an
airplane
in
no
way
did
the
landscape
resemble
that
of
the
earth
to
begin
with
pillars
of
huge
dimensions
were
placed
every
or
so
it
was
these
that
supported
the
intricate
archwork
above
they
were
made
of
the
same
translucent
stuff
as
the
crust
but
had
a
light
topaz
tint
the
venusian
said
you
will
not
need
to
be
told
that
the
science
of
metallurgy
has
advanced
quite
far
with
us
all
our
metals
can
be
made
transparent
if
we
like
those
pillars
are
colored
variously
in
different
regions
so
as
to
be
clearly
distinguishable
and
prevent
collisions
of
flying
apparatus
but
van
emmon
and
billie
were
both
more
interested
in
what
lay
between
the
columns
they
scarcely
noticed
that
there
were
no
people
in
sight
at
the
time
the
ground
was
covered
with
an
indescribable
wealth
of
color
and
it
was
only
by
a
close
examination
that
the
buildings
could
be
distinguished
as
such
for
they
were
all
made
of
that
stuff
of
every
conceivable
tint
and
shade
the
structure
showed
an
utter
lack
of
uniformity
in
size
shape
or
arrangement
moreover
the
ground
was
absolutely
packed
with
them
they
spread
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
but
if
there
was
profusion
there
also
was
confusion
apparently
streets
ran
anywhere
and
everywhere
there
was
no
visible
system
to
anything
and
where
there
was
no
space
for
a
building
invariably
there
was
a
shrub
a
bush
or
a
small
tree
of
some
kind
all
in
full
flower
the
only
sign
of
regularity
to
be
seen
was
in
the
roofs
practically
all
of
them
were
flat
whether
the
building
was
some
rambling
loosely
gathered
agglomeration
of
wings
or
a
single
towering
skyscraper
of
one
tint
almost
inevitably
it
was
crowned
with
a
perfectly
level
surface
i
see
said
van
emmon
thoughtfully
you
have
no
rain
precisely
from
estra
we
have
the
air
completely
under
our
control
we
give
our
vegetation
artificial
showers
when
we
think
it
should
have
it
not
when
nature
wills
and
similarly
we
use
electricity
instead
of
sunlight
that
we
may
stimulate
its
growth
in
short
van
emmon
put
it
as
the
car
slid
slowly
down
the
remaining
distance
in
short
you
have
abolished
the
weather
the
venusian
nodded
and
i
save
you
the
trouble
of
suggesting
he
added
that
we
are
nothing
more
nor
less
than
hothouse
people
v
the
human
conservatory
but
there
is
this
difference
he
cautioned
as
they
stepped
out
of
the
elevator
into
a
sort
of
a
plaza
that
whereas
you
people
on
the
earth
have
only
begun
to
use
the
hothouse
principle
we
here
have
perfected
it
i
suggest
that
you
waste
no
time
looking
for
faults
van
emmon
stared
at
the
doctor
how
does
this
idea
fit
your
theory
kinney
that
venus
is
simply
the
earth
plus
several
thousand
extra
generations
of
civilization
fit
echoed
the
doctor
fits
like
a
glove
we
humans
are
fast
becoming
a
race
of
despite
all
the
various
nature
movements
look
at
the
popularity
of
inclosed
automobiles
for
example
the
only
thing
that
surprises
me
turning
to
their
guide
is
that
you
use
your
legs
for
their
original
purpose
estra
smiled
and
pointed
out
something
standing
a
few
feet
away
it
was
a
small
with
clear
glass
sides
which
had
actually
made
them
overlook
it
at
first
peering
closer
they
saw
that
the
plaza
and
surrounding
streets
were
nearly
filled
with
these
all
but
invisible
cars
the
venusian
explained
you
marvel
that
i
use
my
legs
and
walk
the
same
as
you
do
i
am
glad
you
have
brought
up
this
point
because
it
is
a
fact
that
our
people
use
mechanisms
instead
of
bodily
energy
almost
altogether
these
cars
you
see
are
universally
used
for
transportation
i
am
one
of
the
very
few
who
appreciate
the
value
of
natural
exercise
do
you
mean
to
say
demanded
van
emmon
that
the
average
venusian
does
no
walking
not
a
mile
a
year
said
estra
gravely
just
what
he
is
obliged
to
do
indoors
from
room
to
room
and
he
involuntarily
glanced
down
at
his
own
extremely
thin
legs
the
architect
eyes
widened
with
a
growing
understanding
i
see
now
she
murmured
that
why
there
was
no
one
else
to
greet
us
the
venusian
smiled
gratefully
we
thought
it
best
you
have
been
shocked
outright
i
am
sure
had
you
been
introduced
to
a
representative
venusian
without
any
explanation
they
fell
silent
still
without
moving
from
the
point
where
they
had
left
the
elevator
the
four
from
the
earth
examined
the
surrounding
buildings
in
a
renewed
effort
to
see
some
system
in
their
arrangement
directly
in
front
of
them
was
a
particularly
large
structure
like
all
the
rest
it
was
of
hopelessly
irregular
design
yet
it
had
a
large
domed
central
portion
which
gave
it
the
appearance
of
an
auditorium
and
the
effect
was
further
borne
out
by
a
subdued
humming
sound
which
seemed
to
come
from
it
smith
asked
estra
if
it
were
a
hall
yes
and
no
was
the
answer
it
fills
the
purpose
of
a
hall
but
is
not
built
on
the
hall
plan
and
smith
tried
to
stare
through
the
translucent
walls
of
the
thing
the
other
buildings
within
immediate
reach
were
of
every
possible
appearance
some
would
have
passed
for
cottages
others
for
stores
still
others
for
the
most
fanciful
of
studios
and
nowhere
was
there
such
a
thing
as
a
sign
even
at
the
street
corners
much
less
on
a
building
not
that
we
would
be
able
to
read
your
signs
if
you
had
them
commented
the
doctor
but
i
like
to
know
how
your
people
find
their
way
without
something
of
that
kind
to
guide
them
estra
smile
did
not
change
that
is
something
you
will
understand
better
before
long
said
he
provided
you
feel
ready
to
explore
a
little
further
the
four
looked
at
each
other
in
question
and
suddenly
it
struck
them
all
that
they
were
a
rather
crew
in
their
cumbersome
suits
of
armor
and
formidable
helmets
the
doctor
turned
to
estra
you
ought
to
know
he
appealed
whether
we
can
take
off
these
suits
now
it
would
be
best
was
the
reply
you
will
find
the
air
and
temperature
decidedly
more
warm
and
moist
than
what
you
have
been
used
to
but
otherwise
practically
the
same
there
is
a
slightly
larger
proportion
of
oxygen
that
is
all
just
imagine
you
are
in
a
hothouse
smith
and
the
doctor
were
already
discarding
their
suits
van
emmon
and
billie
followed
more
slowly
the
one
because
he
did
not
share
the
doctor
confidence
in
their
guide
the
other
because
of
a
sudden
shyness
in
his
presence
the
venusian
noted
this
you
need
not
feel
any
embarrassment
said
he
to
billie
vast
astonishment
there
is
no
distinction
here
between
the
dress
of
the
two
sexes
and
again
all
four
marveled
that
he
should
know
so
much
about
them
once
out
of
the
armor
the
visitors
felt
much
more
at
ease
the
slightly
reduced
gravitation
gave
them
a
sense
of
lightness
and
freedom
which
more
than
balanced
the
junglelike
oppressiveness
of
the
air
they
found
themselves
guarding
against
a
certain
exuberance
perhaps
it
was
the
extra
oxygen
too
they
strode
toward
the
large
structure
directly
ahead
at
its
entrance
a
wide
square
portal
which
opened
into
a
lobby
estra
paused
and
smiled
apologetically
as
he
mopped
his
forehead
and
upper
lip
with
a
paper
handkerchief
which
he
immediately
dropped
into
a
small
covered
opening
in
the
wall
at
his
side
these
little
doors
by
the
way
were
to
be
seen
at
frequent
intervals
wherever
they
went
incidentally
not
a
scrap
of
paper
or
other
refuse
was
to
be
noted
anywhere
streets
and
all
were
spotless
as
for
estra
i
am
not
accustomed
to
moving
at
such
speed
he
explained
his
discomfort
if
you
do
not
mind
please
walk
a
little
more
leisurely
they
took
their
time
about
passing
through
this
lobby
for
one
thing
estra
said
there
would
have
to
be
a
small
delay
and
for
another
the
walls
and
ceilings
of
the
space
were
most
remarkably
ornamented
they
were
fairly
covered
with
what
appeared
at
first
glance
to
be
absolutely
lifelike
paintings
and
sculptures
they
were
so
arranged
as
to
strengthen
the
structural
lines
of
the
place
and
of
course
they
were
of
more
interest
to
billie
than
to
the
others

the
specialist

architecture

subjects

referred
to
williams

report
to
the
for
details
of
these
basrelief
photographs
desiring
to
examine
some
of
the
work
far
overhead
billie
clambered
up
on
a
convenient
pedestal
in
order
to
look
more
closely
she
took
the
strength
of
things
for
granted
and
put
her
weight
too
heavily
on
a
molding
on
the
edge
of
the
pedestal
with
the
result
that
there
was
a
sharp
crack
and
the
girl
struck
the
floor
in
a
heap
she
got
to
her
feet
before
van
emmon
could
reach
her
side
but
her
face
was
white
with
pain
sprained
ankle
said
she
between
set
lips
and
proceeded
to
stump
up
and
down
the
lobby
to
limber
up
as
she
said
although
her
three
companions
offered
to
do
anything
that
might
relieve
her
to
the
surprise
of
all
estra
leaned
against
a
pillar
and
watched
the
whole
affair
with
perfect
composure
he
made
no
offer
of
help
said
nothing
whatever
in
sympathy
in
a
moment
he
noticed
the
looks
they
gave
him
their
stares
i
must
beg
your
pardon
he
said
still
smiling
i
am
sorry
this
happened
it
will
not
be
easy
to
explain
but
you
will
find
all
venusians
very
unsympathetic
not
that
we
are
hard
hearted
but
because
we
simply
lost
the
power
of
sympathy
we
do
not
know
what
pity
is
we
have
eliminated
everything
that
is
disagreeable
all
that
is
painful
from
our
lives
to
such
an
extent
that
there
is
never
any
cause
for
pity
the
three
young
people
could
say
nothing
in
answer
the
doctor
however
spoke
thoughtfully
perhaps
it
is
superfluous
but
tell
me
have
you
done
away
with
injustice
estra
that
is
just
the
point
agreed
the
venusian
justice
took
the
place
of
pity
and
mercy
it
was
so
long
ago
i
am
barely
able
to
appreciate
your
own
views
on
the
subject
billie
her
ankle
somewhat
better
turned
to
examine
other
work
but
at
the
moment
another
venusian
approached
from
the
upper
end
of
the
lobby
walking
slowly
he
carried
four
small
parcels
with
a
great
deal
of
effort
and
the
explorers
had
time
to
scrutinize
him
closely
he
was
built
much
like
estra
but
shorter
and
with
a
little
more
flesh
about
the
torso
his
forehead
bulged
directly
over
his
eyes
instead
of
above
his
ears
as
did
estra
also
his
eyes
were
smaller
and
not
as
far
apart
his
whole
expression
was
equally
kind
and
affable
despite
a
curiously
shriveled
appearance
of
his
lips
they
made
the
front
of
his
mouth
quite
flat
and
served
to
take
attention
away
from
his
pitifully
thin
legs
estra
greeted
him
with
a
cheery
phrase
in
a
language
decidedly
different
from
any
the
explorers
were
familiar
with
in
a
way
it
was
spanish
or
rather
the
pure
castilian
tongue
but
it
seemed
to
be
devoid
of
dental
consonants
it
was
very
agreeable
to
listen
to
estra
however
had
taken
the
four
parcels
from
his
comrade
and
now
presented
him
to
the
four
saying
that
his
name
was
kalara
and
that
he
was
a
machinist
he
can
not
use
your
tongue
said
the
venusian
few
of
us
have
mastered
it
there
are
difficulties
as
for
these
machines
unwrapping
the
parcels
i
must
apologize
in
advance
for
certain
defects
in
their
design
i
invented
them
under
pressure
so
to
speak
having
to
perfect
the
whole
idea
in
the
rather
short
time
that
has
elapsed
since
you
doctor
began
the
and
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
machines
from
billie
as
she
was
about
to
accept
the
first
of
the
devices
from
the
venusian
for
some
reason
he
appeared
to
be
especially
interested
in
the
girl
and
addressed
half
of
his
remarks
to
her
and
it
was
while
his
smiling
gaze
was
fixed
upon
her
eyes
that
he
gave
the
answer
they
are
to
serve
very
carefully
partly
as
lexicons
and
partly
as
grammars
in
short
they
are
mechanical
interpreters
vi
the
translating
machines
first
let
me
remind
you
said
the
venusian
of
our
lack
of
certain
elements
that
you
are
familiar
with
on
the
earth
we
have
never
been
able
to
improve
on
the
common
telephone
that
is
why
we
must
still
assemble
in
person
whenever
we
have
any
collective
activity
while
on
the
earth
the
time
will
come
when
your
wireless
principle
will
be
developed
to
the
point
of
transmitting
both
light
and
sound
and
after
that
there
will
be
little
need
of
gatherings
of
any
sort
then
he
explained
the
apparatus
it
consisted
of
a
miniature
telephone
connected
to
a
small
metallic
case
the
size
of
a
the
cover
of
which
was
a
transparent
diaphragm
estra
did
not
open
the
case
but
showed
the
mechanism
through
the
cover
essentially
this
is
a
device
said
he
pointing
to
a
swiftly
revolving
dial
within
the
box
on
one
face
of
that
dial
are
some
ten
thousand
made
by
vibration
after
the
phonograph
method
directly
opposite
on
the
other
face
are
the
corresponding
words
in
the
other
language
the
disk
is
rotating
at
such
an
enormous
speed
that
for
all
practical
purposes
any
word
which
may
chance
to
be
spoken
will
be
translated
almost
instantaneously
he
indicated
two
delicate
feelers
as
he
called
them
one
on
each
face
of
the
disk
one
of
these
felt
the
proper
as
it
whirled
beneath
while
the
other
established
an
electrical
contact
with
the
corresponding
waves
beneath
at
the
same
time
exciting
a
talking
machine
that
commented
estra
is
not
so
easy
to
explain
it
transforms
this
literal
translation
into
an
idiomatic
one
perhaps
you
will
understand
its
workings
a
little
later
when
you
learn
how
and
why
i
am
able
to
use
your
own
language
by
this
time
the
four
had
reached
the
point
where
nothing
could
surprise
them
they
were
becoming
accustomed
to
the
unaccustomed
had
they
been
told
that
the
venusians
had
abolished
speech
altogether
they
would
have
felt
disappointed
but
not
incredulous
however
the
doctor
thought
of
something
have
you
any
extra
to
be
used
in
case
we
visit
some
other
nations
while
we
are
here
for
just
a
second
the
venusian
was
puzzled
then
his
smile
broadened
the
one
record
will
do
said
he
wherever
you
go
a
universal
language
billie
eyes
sparkled
with
interest
long
long
ago
estra
said
it
was
established
soon
after
our
league
of
nations
was
formed
does
the
league
actually
prevent
war
and
promote
peace
demanded
van
emmon
this
had
been
a
disputed
question
when
the
four
left
the
earth
we
no
longer
have
a
league
of
nations
said
their
guide
slowly
and
instantly
the
four
were
eying
him
eagerly
this
was
really
refreshing
to
find
that
the
venusians
were
actually
lacking
in
something
so
it
did
work
commented
the
doctor
disappointed
but
the
venusian
smile
was
still
there
it
worked
itself
out
said
he
we
have
no
further
use
for
a
league
we
have
no
more
nations
we
are
now
one
and
he
helped
them
adjust
the
machines
the
cases
were
slung
over
their
shoulders
and
the
telephones
clamped
to
their
ears
when
all
ready
estra
began
to
talk
and
his
voice
came
nearly
as
sharp
and
clear
through
the
apparatus
as
before
it
was
modified
by
a
metallic
flatness
together
with
a
certain
amount
of
mechanical
noise
in
which
a
peculiar
hissing
was
the
most
noticeable
otherwise
he
said
i
am
now
using
my
own
language
if
i
make
any
mistakes
you
must
not
blame
the
machine
it
is
as
nearly
perfect
as
i
was
able
to
make
it
he
then
asked
them
what
blunders
they
noted
billie
who
was
the
most
enthusiastic
about
the
thing
declared
that
they
would
have
no
trouble
in
understanding
whereupon
estra
quietly
asked
do
you
feel
like
going
now
to
try
them
out
once
more
an
exchange
of
glances
between
the
four
from
the
earth
clearly
the
venusians
were
extremely
considerate
people
to
leave
their
visitors
in
the
care
of
the
one
man
apparently
who
was
able
to
make
them
feel
at
home
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
for
uneasiness
but
van
emmon
still
had
his
old
misgivings
about
estra
there
was
something
about
the
effeminate
venusian
which
irritated
the
big
geologist
it
always
does
make
a
strong
man
suspicious
to
see
a
weaker
one
show
such
van
emmon
drew
the
doctor
and
billie
aside
while
smith
and
estra
went
on
with
the
test
said
van
emmon
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
the
cube
might
look
pretty
good
to
these
people
you
remember
what
this
chap
said
about
their
lack
of
some
of
our
chemicals
what
do
you
think
is
it
really
safe
to
put
ourselves
entirely
in
their
power
you
mean
said
the
doctor
slowly
that
they
might
try
to
keep
us
here
rather
than
lose
the
cube
van
emmon
nodded
gravely
but
billie
had
strong
objections
estra
does
look
like
that
sort
she
declared
vehemently
he
too
good
natured
to
be
a
crook
he
needs
a
guardian
rather
than
a
warden
it
flashed
into
the
doctor
mind
that
many
a
woman
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
man
merely
because
he
seemed
to
be
in
need
of
some
one
to
take
care
of
him
that
is
the
kind
of
woman
and
billie
certainly
was
reliant
something
of
the
same
notion
came
vaguely
to
the
geologist
at
the
same
time
and
with
a
vigor
that
was
quite
uncalled
for
he
urged
i
say
first
we
should
have
left
the
cube
unguarded
i
propose
that
one
of
us
at
least
return
to
the
surface
while
the
others
attend
this
meeting
or
trap
for
all
we
know
all
right
said
billie
promptly
get
estra
to
show
you
how
to
use
the
elevator
and
wait
for
us
in
the
vestibule
van
emmon
face
flamed
that
is
what
i
meant
hotly
if
anybody
goes
to
the
cube
it
should
be
you
billie
if
billie
did
not
notice
the
use
of
her
nickname
at
least
the
doctor
did
the
girl
simply
snorted
if
you
think
for
one
second
that
i
going
to
back
out
just
because
a
woman
let
me
tell
you
that
you
very
badly
mistaken
van
emmon
turned
to
the
doctor
appealingly
but
the
doctor
took
the
action
personally
he
shook
his
head
i
would
miss
this
for
anything
van
estra
looks
safe
to
me
go
and
ask
smith
maybe
he
is
willing
to
be
the
goat
the
geologist
took
one
good
look
at
the
engineer
absorbed
unquestioning
manner
as
he
listened
to
the
venusian
and
gave
up
the
idea
with
a
sigh
for
a
moment
he
was
sour
then
he
smiled
shyly
i
more
than
anxious
to
meet
the
bunch
myself
he
admitted
and
led
the
way
back
to
estra
the
venusian
looked
at
him
with
no
change
of
expression
although
there
was
something
very
disconcerting
in
the
precocious
wisdom
of
his
eyes
their
very
kindliness
and
serenity
gave
him
an
appearance
of
superiority
such
as
only
aggravated
the
geologist
suspicions
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
trust
him
they
followed
him
through
two
sets
of
doors
which
slid
noiselessly
open
before
them
in
response
to
some
mechanism
operated
by
the
venusian
steps
this
brought
them
to
another
of
the
glass
elevators
in
which
they
descended
perhaps
ten
feet
stepping
out
of
it
onto
a
moving
platform
this
in
turn
extended
the
length
of
a
low
dimly
lighted
passageway
about
a
hundred
yards
long
when
they
got
off
they
were
standing
in
a
small
anteroom
the
venusian
paused
and
smiled
at
the
four
again
do
you
feel
like
going
on
display
now
he
asked
then
added
i
should
have
said
you
feel
like
seeing
venus
on
display
for
we
all
know
more
or
less
about
you
already
but
the
visitors
were
braced
for
the
experience
estra
looked
at
each
approvingly
and
then
did
something
which
made
them
wonder
he
stood
stock
still
for
perhaps
a
second
his
eyes
closed
as
though
listening
and
then
without
explanation
he
led
the
way
through
an
door
into
a
brilliantly
lighted
space
next
moment
the
explorers
were
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
people
of
venus
vii
the
ultimate
race
the
four
were
at
the
bottom
of
a
huge
conelike
pit
such
as
instantly
reminded
the
doctor
of
a
medical
clinic
the
space
where
they
stood
was
perhaps
twenty
feet
in
diameter
while
the
walls
enclosing
the
whole
hall
were
many
hundreds
of
feet
apart
and
sloping
up
from
the
center
on
all
sides
was
tier
upon
tier
of
the
most
extraordinary
seats
in
all
creation
for
each
and
every
one
of
those
thousands
of
venusians
was
separately
enclosed
in
glass
nowhere
was
there
a
figure
to
be
seen
who
was
not
installed
in
one
of
those
small
transparent
boxes
just
large
enough
for
a
single
person
moreover
and
it
came
somewhat
as
a
shock
to
the
four
when
they
noted
it
the
central
platform
itself
was
both
covered
and
surrounded
with
the
same
material
make
yourselves
at
home
estra
was
saying
he
pointed
to
several
microphones
within
easy
reach
these
are
provided
with
my
translators
so
when
you
are
ready
to
open
up
conversation
go
right
ahead
as
though
you
were
among
your
own
people
and
he
made
himself
comfortable
in
a
saddlelike
chair
as
much
as
to
say
that
there
was
no
hurry
for
a
long
time
the
explorers
stood
taking
it
in
the
venusians
without
exception
stared
back
at
them
with
nearly
equal
curiosity
and
despite
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
proceeding
this
mutual
scrutiny
took
place
in
comparative
silence
for
while
the
glass
gave
a
certain
sense
of
security
to
the
newcomers
it
also
cut
off
all
sound
except
that
low
humming
the
nearest
row
of
the
people
got
their
closest
attention
without
exception
they
had
the
same
general
build
as
estra
slim
delicate
and
anemic
they
resembled
a
ward
full
of
convalescent
consumptives
as
the
doctor
commented
under
his
breath
not
one
of
them
would
ever
give
a
material
for
a
anecdote
at
the
same
time
there
was
nothing
feverish
nervous
or
broken
down
in
their
appearance
a
pretty
lot
of
invalids
as
billie
added
to
the
doctor
remark
many
observers
would
have
been
struck
first
by
the
extreme
diversity
in
the
matter
of
dress
all
wore
clothing
and
much
of
it
was
silky
like
estra
but
there
was
a
bewildering
assortment
of
colors
and
the
most
extraordinary
decorations
or
rather
ornaments
so
far
as
dress
went
there
was
no
telling
anything
whatever
about
sex
are
they
all
men
asked
billie
wondering
of
estra
the
venusian
shook
his
head
with
his
invariable
smile
nor
all
women
either
said
he
enigmatically
but
in
many
respects
they
were
astonishingly
alike
almost
to
a
soul
their
upper
lips
were
withered
and
flat
one
and
all
had
short
legs
each
and
every
one
had
a
crop
of
really
luxuriant
hair
the
shades
varied
between
the
usual
blonde
and
brunette
with
little
of
the
reddishness
so
common
on
the
earth
but
there
were
no
bald
people
at
all
on
the
other
hand
there
were
no
beards
or
mustaches
in
the
whole
crowd
every
face
was
bare
like
a
lot
of
chinamen
said
van
emmon
in
an
undertone
ca
tell
one
from
another
but
billie
pointed
out
that
this
was
not
strictly
true
a
close
inspection
of
the
faces
showed
an
extremely
wide
range
of
distinction
no
two
chins
in
the
crowd
were
exactly
alike
although
not
one
of
them
showed
any
of
the
resolute
firmness
which
is
admired
on
the
earth
all
were
weak
yet
different
neither
were
there
any
prominent
noses
although
there
were
none
that
could
have
been
called
insignificant
and
while
every
pair
of
eyes
in
the
place
was
large
as
large
as
estra
yet
there
was
every
desirable
color
and
expression
to
sum
it
all
up
and
to
use
the
doctor
words
they
developed
a
standard
type
all
right
just
as
the
characteristic
american
face
is
the
standard
earth
type
but
did
you
ever
see
such
variations
nevertheless
the
most
striking
thing
about
these
people
to
the
eyes
of
the
visitors
was
their
mutual
resemblance
for
one
thing
there
seemed
to
be
no
nervous
people
present
there
were
many
children
in
the
crowd
too
yet
all
sat
very
still
and
only
an
occasional
movement
of
the
hands
served
to
indicate
consciousness
in
this
sense
they
were
all
remarkably
well
bred
in
another
they
were
remarkably
rude
at
any
given
moment
a
good
half
of
the
people
were
eating
or
rather
sipping
liquids
of
various
sorts
from
small
tumblers
probably
every
person
in
the
house
before
the
affair
was
over
had
imbibed
two
or
three
ounces
of
fluid
but
not
once
was
the
matter
apologized
for
nor
the
four
invited
to
partake
so
this
may
be
the
outcome
of
our
outrageous
habit
of
eating
sweetmeats
at
theaters
muttered
the
doctor
and
again
noting
the
hairless
faces
just
what
i
said
when
men
first
began
using
those
depilatories
instead
of
shaving
no
more
beards
but
it
was
billie
who
explained
the
invariable
crop
of
hair
no
use
to
look
for
baldness
they
do
wear
hats
why
should
they
since
neither
sun
nor
rain
to
protect
their
heads
from
mainly
however
the
architect
was
interested
in
the
building
itself
to
her
the
most
striking
feature
was
not
the
tremendously
arched
dome
nor
yet
the
remarkable
system
of
bracing
which
dispensed
with
any
columns
in
all
that
vast
space
it
was
something
simpler
there
were
no
aisles
now
what
do
you
make
of
that
the
girl
asked
van
emmon
how
do
they
ever
get
to
their
places
but
he
could
not
suggest
anything
more
than
to
recall
an
individual
elevator
scheme
once
proposed
to
smith
one
object
of
interest
was
the
telephone
system
remarkably
like
those
used
on
the
earth
one
was
located
in
each
of
the
tiny
glass
cages
he
was
likewise
puzzled
to
account
for
the
ventilation
system
each
cage
was
apparently
yet
no
venusian
showed
any
discomfort
but
the
geologist
for
want
of
anything
strictly
within
his
professional
range
interested
himself
in
trying
to
fathom
the
moral
attitude
of
these
people
he
was
still
suspicious
of
them
notwithstanding
a
growing
tendency
to
like
every
one
of
their
pleasant
really
agreeable
faces
there
was
neither
solemnity
sourness
nor
bitterness
to
be
seen
anywhere
at
the
same
time
there
was
no
sign
of
levity
in
every
countenance
was
the
same
inexplicable
mixture
of
wisdom
and
benevolence
that
distinguished
estra
nowhere
was
there
hostility
and
nowhere
was
there
crudity
somehow
the
big
geologist
would
have
felt
more
at
home
had
he
seen
something
antagonistic
essentially
van
emmon
was
a
fighter
at
last
the
four
felt
their
attention
lagging
novelties
always
pall
quickly
no
matter
how
striking
estra
sensed
the
feeling
and
inquired
which
of
you
will
do
the
honors
instinctively
the
three
younger
folk
turned
to
the
doctor
he
made
no
protest
but
stepped
at
once
to
one
of
the
microphones
put
on
his
most
impressive
professional
face
and
began
my
friends
and
van
emmon
noted
a
pleased
look
come
into
every
face
about
them
my
friends
i
do
not
need
to
state
how
significant
this
meeting
is
to
us
all
from
what
estra
has
said
i
gather
that
you
have
informed
yourselves
regarding
us
in
some
manner
which
he
has
promised
to
make
clear
at
all
events
i
am
exceedingly
anxious
to
see
your
astronomical
apparatus
at
this
a
broad
smile
came
to
many
of
the
faces
before
him
but
he
went
on
unnoticing
certainly
there
is
not
much
i
could
tell
you
which
you
do
not
already
know
estra
use
of
our
language
proves
this
i
only
need
to
assure
you
that
we
will
be
glad
to
answer
any
questions
that
may
occur
to
you
it
goes
without
saying
that
we
of
course
are
filled
with
delight
to
find
your
planet
so
wondrously
and
happily
populated
especially
after
our
experience
on
mercury
of
which
i
presume
you
are
informed
apparently
they
were
the
doctor
went
on
you
may
be
sure
that
we
are
fairly
bursting
with
questions
however
we
are
content
to
become
informed
as
estra
sees
fit
to
guide
us
there
is
just
one
thing
more
than
any
other
which
i
would
like
to
know
at
this
time
why
is
it
that
although
you
all
show
a
great
lack
of
exercise
and
are
continually
eating
you
never
appear
to
be
healthy
instantly
a
venusian
in
the
fifth
row
to
the
doctor
right
touched
his
phone
and
replied
it
is
a
matter
of
diet
we
have
nothing
but
foods
if
you
understand
what
that
means
and
from
that
time
on
despite
the
fact
that
the
explorers
asked
questions
which
at
home
would
have
found
hundreds
ready
and
able
to
answer
on
venus
only
one
person
answered
any
given
question
and
always
without
any
apparent
prearrangement
for
a
long
time
they
could
not
account
for
this
the
doctor
motioned
for
smith
to
take
his
place
the
engineer
looked
a
little
embarrassed
but
cleared
his
throat
noisily
and
said
i
am
especially
struck
with
the
fact
that
each
of
you
sits
in
a
separate
glass
pew
or
case
why
is
this
the
reply
came
from
one
of
the
few
people
present
who
showed
any
signs
of
age
he
was
perhaps
sixty
and
his
hair
was
fast
whitening
he
said
for
reasons
of
sanitation
it
is
not
wise
to
breathe
the
breath
of
another
also
supplemented
someone
from
the
other
side
of
that
vast
pit
also
each
is
thereby
enabled
to
surround
himself
with
the
electrical
influences
which
suit
him
best
smith
stepped
back
pondering
the
doctor
looked
to
the
geologist
to
take
his
place
but
van
emmon
made
way
for
billie
at
any
other
time
she
would
have
resented
his
attitude
now
she
quickly
found
voice
how
are
you
able
to
get
along
without
aisles
it
may
seem
a
foolish
question
to
you
but
on
earth
we
would
consider
a
hall
without
aisles
about
as
convenient
as
a
room
without
a
door
immediately
a
venusian
directly
in
front
of
her
and
on
a
level
with
her
eyes
called
out
watch
me
madam
and
quite
without
an
effort
beyond
touching
a
button
or
two
the
fellow
rose
straight
into
the
air
glass
and
all
and
then
floated
gently
over
toward
the
middle
of
the
hall
it
probably
appears
complicated
to
you
explained
the
venusian
whose
side
he
had
just
left
we
make
use
of
elements
not
found
on
your
earth
billie
sang
froid
was
not
shaken
instantly
she
came
back
energetically
apparently
your
method
overcomes
gravitation
why
have
you
tried
to
travel
away
from
your
planet
and
she
looked
around
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
uttered
a
poser
only
to
have
another
of
the
people
reply
from
a
point
which
she
was
not
able
to
locate
because
enough
such
power
can
not
be
safely
concentrated
as
billie
retired
van
emmon
noted
with
growing
irritation
that
the
continuously
affable
aspect
of
the
venusians
had
not
altered
in
any
way
unless
it
was
to
become
even
more
genial
and
sure
the
big
man
strode
energetically
to
the
microphone
and
the
other
three
noted
a
general
movement
of
interest
and
admiration
as
the
people
inspected
him
why
demanded
he
do
we
see
no
signs
of
contention
if
you
are
familiar
with
conditions
on
the
earth
you
surely
know
that
rivalry
in
one
form
or
another
is
the
accepted
basis
of
life
but
all
of
you
here
appear
to
be
perfectly
happy
and
at
the
same
time
entirely
sure
of
yourselves
we
have
just
come
from
a
planet
where
we
have
seen
the
principle
of
combat
of
competition
carried
so
far
that
it
seems
to
have
wrecked
the
race
so
you
will
pardon
my
curiosity
i
am
sure
from
your
faces
one
would
conclude
that
you
had
abolished
altogether
just
why
are
you
so
well
extraordinarily
and
he
thrust
out
his
aggressive
jaw
as
though
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
chins
about
him
because
there
is
nothing
for
us
to
combat
save
within
ourselves
this
from
a
chap
in
a
suit
but
surely
you
have
rivalry
of
some
sort
no
another
voice
added
rivalry
is
the
outgrowth
of
getting
a
livelihood
on
earth
it
is
inevitable
because
men
do
the
work
here
everything
is
done
by
machines
still
another
put
in
discontent
is
the
mother
of
ambition
but
we
are
all
content
because
each
possesses
all
he
desires
but
the
geologist
was
far
from
satisfied
then
said
he
vigorously
if
you
have
eliminated
all
contention
you
have
nullified
the
great
law
of
contrasts
you
say
you
are
all
rich
how
do
you
know
if
you
have
no
poverty
to
contrast
it
with
on
earth
we
appreciate
warmth
because
we
have
experienced
cold
pleasure
because
we
know
pain
happiness
because
we
have
always
had
misery
with
us
if
we
have
not
had
the
one
we
can
not
value
the
other
if
you
have
never
been
discontented
how
do
you
know
that
you
are
content
viii
the
for
a
minute
or
two
it
looked
as
though
van
emmon
had
raised
an
unanswerable
question
there
was
no
immediate
reply
even
estra
looked
around
as
though
in
wonder
at
the
silence
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
answering
of
his
own
accord
when
a
voice
came
from
a
man
far
up
on
the
left
he
said
a
little
explanation
may
be
wise
to
begin
with
you
will
agree
that
black
is
black
because
white
is
white
but
it
does
follow
that
blue
is
blue
because
green
is
green
or
red
is
red
blue
is
blue
because
it
is
neither
green
nor
red
nor
any
other
color
it
is
blue
not
because
it
contrasts
with
these
other
colors
but
because
it
merely
differs
from
them
now
we
on
venus
do
not
need
poverty
in
order
to
appreciate
wealth
instead
each
of
us
is
blessed
with
his
own
particular
choice
of
wealth
each
is
blessed
in
a
different
way
some
with
children
some
with
intellect
some
with
other
matters
and
the
question
of
mere
quantity
never
enters
we
do
not
need
pain
or
misery
spoke
up
someone
else
any
more
than
you
people
on
the
earth
require
an
additional
color
in
order
to
appreciate
the
variety
you
already
have
and
then
from
a
venusian
with
an
especially
strong
voice
that
we
are
really
content
we
know
absolutely
for
each
of
us
in
his
own
distinctive
way
is
wholly
and
peculiarly
satisfied
and
it
only
added
to
the
geologist
irritation
to
have
these
striking
statements
made
in
a
impersonal
fashion
which
totally
disarmed
all
opposition
that
the
venusians
were
perfectly
sure
of
their
ground
was
undeniable
but
they
had
such
a
cheerful
way
of
looking
at
it
as
though
they
did
care
a
rap
whether
van
emmon
agreed
or
not
that
if
they
only
have
shown
some
spirit
van
emmon
would
have
liked
it
infinitely
better
if
one
of
them
had
only
become
hot
about
it
at
this
point
estra
rose
in
his
chair
i
think
you
had
best
approach
us
from
a
fresh
viewpoint
said
he
in
his
unfailingly
agreeable
manner
the
doctor
nodded
vigorously
and
again
estra
closed
his
eyes
in
that
odd
hesitating
way
immediately
every
one
in
the
place
with
the
exception
of
a
single
person
in
the
lowest
row
took
flight
in
his
or
her
little
glass
pew
in
a
moment
the
great
vault
overhead
was
fairly
swarming
with
people
and
in
less
than
a
minute
the
last
of
them
had
floated
out
through
one
of
the
arches
in
the
walls
estra
opened
a
panel
in
the
central
cage
and
admitted
the
venusian
who
had
stayed
behind
she
for
it
appeared
to
be
a
young
woman
walked
with
about
the
same
facility
as
estra
but
as
soon
as
she
had
entered
the
space
took
the
seat
estra
had
vacated
and
waited
the
action
rather
disappointed
the
doctor
he
removed
the
interpreting
telephone
from
his
head
and
asked
i
rather
thought
we
were
going
to
meet
one
of
your
officials
estra
we
hate
to
go
back
home
without
having
met
your
president
or
whatever
you
call
your
chief
executive
the
two
venusians
exchanged
smiles
and
to
the
surprise
of
the
explorers
the
woman
gave
the
reply
in
language
as
good
as
estra
but
an
even
sweeter
expression
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
chief
executive
on
venus
friends
i
meant
explained
the
doctor
rattled
the
chairman
of
your
cabinet
or
council
or
whatever
it
is
that
regulates
your
affairs
perhaps
with
an
inspiration
i
should
have
said
the
speaker
of
your
congress
the
venusian
shook
her
head
still
smiling
she
hesitated
while
selecting
the
best
words
and
the
four
noted
that
while
her
features
were
quite
as
delicate
as
estra
her
face
was
proportionately
larger
and
her
whole
figure
better
filled
out
no
one
would
have
said
that
she
was
pretty
much
less
beautiful
but
none
would
deny
that
she
was
very
in
a
wholesome
intelligent
capable
sort
of
a
way
her
name
estra
told
them
later
was
myrin
and
he
explained
that
he
and
she
were
associated
solely
because
of
their
mutual
interest
in
the
same
planet
the
earth
said
myrin
you
are
accustomed
to
the
idea
of
government
we
however
have
outgrown
it
if
you
stop
to
think
you
will
agree
that
the
purpose
of
government
is
to
maintain
peace
on
the
one
hand
and
to
wage
war
on
the
other
now
as
to
war
we
have
even
separate
nations
any
more
so
we
have
no
wars
and
as
for
internal
conflict
why
should
we
ever
quarrel
when
each
of
us
is
assured
all
that
he
can
possibly
want
so
you
have
abolished
government
a
very
long
time
ago
you
on
the
earth
will
do
the
same
as
soon
as
your
people
have
been
educated
up
to
the
point
of
trusting
each
other
you
have
even
a
congress
then
myrin
shook
her
head
all
questions
such
as
a
congress
would
deal
with
were
settled
ages
ago
you
must
remember
that
the
material
features
of
our
civilization
have
not
changed
for
thousands
of
generations
the
only
questions
that
come
up
now
are
purely
personal
ones
which
each
must
settle
for
himself
van
emmon
as
before
was
not
at
all
satisfied
you
say
that
machinery
does
your
work
for
you
i
presume
you
do
not
mean
that
literally
there
must
be
some
duties
which
can
not
be
performed
without
human
direction
at
least
how
do
you
get
these
duties
accomplished
if
you
have
no
government
to
compel
your
people
to
do
them
myrin
looked
at
a
loss
either
for
the
answer
itself
or
for
the
most
suitable
words
estra
gave
the
reply
every
device
we
possess
is
absolutely
automatic
there
is
not
one
item
in
the
materials
we
use
but
that
was
constructed
exactly
as
you
see
it
now
many
thousands
of
years
ago
smith
was
incredulous
do
you
mean
to
say
that
those
little
glass
pews
have
been
in
use
all
that
time
estra
nodded
smiling
gently
at
the
engineer
amazement
like
everything
else
they
were
built
to
last
you
must
remember
that
we
do
not
have
anything
like
an
here
we
do
not
have
to
consider
the
question
of
our
capital
back
so
if
any
further
improvements
were
to
be
made
they
also
would
be
done
in
a
permanent
fashion
billie
gave
an
exclamation
of
bewilderment
i
do
understand
you
say
that
nothing
new
has
been
built
or
even
replaced
for
centuries
how
do
you
take
care
of
your
increase
in
population
thinking
of
the
great
crowd
that
had
just
left
myrin
was
the
one
who
answered
this
as
she
did
so
she
got
slowly
to
her
feet
and
speaking
with
the
utmost
care
watched
to
be
sure
that
the
four
understood
her
ever
since
the
roof
was
put
on
our
increase
of
population
has
been
exactly
balanced
by
our
death
rate
the
four
followed
their
guides
in
silence
as
they
led
the
way
into
the
plaza
now
the
space
was
alive
with
venusians
the
little
cages
were
everywhere
floating
about
in
the
air
some
of
the
people
were
laboriously
shifting
themselves
into
their
aircraft
others
were
guiding
their
pews
direct
to
nearby
houses
the
visitors
got
plenty
of
curious
stares
from
these
quiet
who
seemed
vastly
more
at
home
in
the
air
than
on
the
ground
as
thick
as
flies
van
emmon
commented
estra
and
myrin
walking
very
slowly
took
them
to
a
side
street
where
two
of
the
cars
were
standing
billie
and
smith
got
in
with
estra
while
van
emmon
and
the
doctor
were
given
seats
beside
the
venusian
woman
the
two
cars
were
connected
by
telephone
so
that
in
effect
the
two
parties
were
one
by
this
time
the
visitors
had
become
so
accustomed
to
the
transparent
material
that
they
felt
no
uneasiness
as
the
ground
receded
below
them
smith
especially
was
tremendously
impressed
with
estra
declaration
that
the
glass
was
except
for
appearance
nothing
more
nor
less
than
an
extremely
strong
steel
alloy
propelled
by
the
unexplained
forces
which
the
two
drivers
controlled
by
means
of
buttons
in
black
cases
the
two
cars
began
to
thread
their
way
through
the
great
and
as
they
proceeded
the
four
grew
more
and
more
amazed
at
the
great
extent
of
the
city
for
miles
upon
miles
that
heterogeneous
collection
of
buildings
stretched
unbroken
and
without
system
until
the
eye
tired
of
trying
to
make
out
the
limits
of
it
what
is
the
name
of
this
city
asked
billie
secretly
hoping
that
it
might
bear
some
resemblance
to
new
york
it
struck
her
fancy
to
assume
that
this
supermetropolis
represented
what
gotham
in
time
might
become
estra
did
not
take
his
attention
from
what
he
was
doing
but
answered
as
readily
as
ever
i
do
not
blame
you
for
mistaking
this
for
a
city
the
fact
is
however
that
we
have
no
such
thing
billie
stared
at
him
helplessly
you
abolished
cities
too
not
exactly
in
the
same
sense
that
we
have
abolished
nations
yes
likewise
we
have
abolished
states
also
counties
neither
have
we
such
a
thing
as
country
now
my
friends
venus
is
simply
one
immense
city
ix
the
survival
of
all
somehow
all
four
were
unwilling
to
press
this
question
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
estra
was
right
or
if
he
was
that
they
could
possibly
understand
his
explanation
should
he
give
it
the
cars
flew
side
by
side
for
perhaps
a
hundred
miles
while
the
visitors
put
in
the
time
in
examining
the
landscape
with
the
interest
of
all
aeronauts
here
and
there
in
that
surface
a
particularly
large
building
was
to
be
noted
every
half
mile
or
so
factories
asked
billie
of
estra
but
he
shook
his
head
i
show
you
factories
later
on
said
he
what
you
see
are
schools
but
most
observers
would
have
considered
the
structures
severely
plain
for
their
purpose
after
a
long
silence
i
still
looking
for
streams
said
van
emmon
to
myrin
are
your
rivers
as
large
as
ours
we
have
no
rivers
was
the
calm
reply
rivers
are
entirely
too
wasteful
of
water
all
our
drainage
is
carried
off
through
underground
canals
you
have
done
away
with
your
oceans
too
have
you
the
geologist
asked
rather
sarcastically
but
he
was
scarcely
prepared
for
the
reply
he
got
no
we
could
get
along
without
them
i
am
afraid
however
we
did
the
best
we
could
in
their
case
and
without
signaling
to
estra
she
dove
the
machine
towards
the
ground
smith
looked
for
the
telephone
wires
to
snap
but
estra
seemed
to
know
and
instantly
followed
lead
the
doctor
noticed
and
wondered
all
the
more
and
then
came
another
surprise
as
the
machines
neared
the
surface
a
familiar
odor
floated
in
through
the
open
windows
of
the
and
the
four
found
themselves
looking
at
each
other
for
signs
of
irrationality
a
moment
and
they
saw
that
they
were
not
mistaken
for
although
that
kaleidoscopic
expanse
of
buildings
showed
not
the
slightest
break
yet
they
were
now
located
on
the
sea
the
houses
were
packed
as
closely
together
as
anywhere
apparently
all
were
floating
yet
not
ten
square
yards
of
open
sea
could
be
seen
in
any
one
spot
van
emmon
almost
forgot
his
resentment
in
his
growing
wonder
that
gets
me
myrin
those
houses
seem
to
be
merely
floating
yet
i
see
no
motion
whatever
why
are
there
no
waves
the
doctor
snorted
shame
on
you
van
do
let
our
friends
think
that
you
an
absolute
ignoramus
he
added
venus
has
no
moon
and
no
wind
at
least
under
the
roof
therefore
no
waves
smith
put
in
that
being
the
case
there
is
no
chance
to
start
a
motor
industry
here
neither
as
he
thought
further
neither
for
having
no
rain
in
your
mountains
estra
where
do
you
get
your
power
but
it
was
myrin
who
answered
i
suppose
you
are
all
familiar
with
radium
it
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
condensed
sunlight
which
in
turn
is
simply
electromagnetic
waves
although
it
may
take
your
scientists
a
good
many
centuries
to
reach
that
conclusion
well
every
particle
of
the
material
which
composes
this
planet
contains
radioactivity
of
some
sort
and
we
long
ago
discovered
a
way
to
release
it
and
use
it
one
pound
of
solid
granite
yields
enough
energy
to
well
a
great
deal
of
power
they
had
now
been
flying
for
two
hours
and
still
no
end
to
that
ever
different
appearance
of
the
ground
also
although
they
saw
a
great
many
birds
they
noted
no
animals
finally
billie
could
hold
in
no
longer
are
we
to
understand
she
demanded
of
estra
that
the
whole
of
this
planet
is
as
densely
populated
as
we
see
it
just
that
replied
the
venusian
why
not
the
roof
makes
our
climate
uniform
from
pole
to
pole
while
our
buildings
are
such
that
whether
on
land
or
on
sea
they
are
equally
livable
but
estra
expostulated
the
girl
venus
is
nearly
as
big
as
the
earth
and
it
looks
to
be
as
thickly
populated
as
as
rhode
island
why
you
must
have
a
colossal
population
let
me
see
and
she
scribbled
away
in
her
memorandum
book
but
both
smith
and
the
doctor
had
already
worked
it
out
they
looked
up
blinking
dazedly
over
three
hundred
billion
murmured
the
doctor
as
though
dizzy
the
venusian
checked
smith
correction
with
you
dropped
one
cipher
doctor
there
are
three
and
a
half
trillion
of
us
good
lord
whispered
van
emmon
all
his
antagonism
gone
for
the
moment
and
again
the
explorers
were
silent
for
a
long
time
by
and
by
however
we
have
just
seen
what
it
meant
there
on
mercury
said
the
doctor
in
a
low
voice
for
the
principle
of
survival
of
the
fit
to
be
carried
to
its
logical
end
for
who
is
to
decide
what
is
fitness
save
the
fittest
one
man
apparently
outlived
every
one
else
on
the
planet
and
then
he
also
died
but
here
you
have
gone
the
limit
in
the
other
direction
of
course
we
might
have
known
that
you
long
ago
abolished
poverty
unearned
wealth
pestilence
drunkenness
and
the
other
causes
of
premature
death
but
as
for
three
and
a
half
trillion
nevertheless
remarked
myrin
every
last
one
of
us
once
born
lives
to
die
of
old
age
and
in
most
cases
this
means
several
hundred
of
your
years
smith
involuntarily
rubbed
his
eyes
and
they
all
laughed
a
nervous
sort
of
a
laugh
which
left
the
visitors
still
in
doubt
as
to
their
senses
and
their
guides
sanity
van
emmon
suspicions
came
back
with
a
rush
and
he
burst
out
say
you
excuse
me
but
i
ca
swallow
this
here
you
shown
us
houses
as
thick
as
leaves
not
a
sign
of
a
farm
much
less
an
orchard
no
vegetation
at
all
except
for
a
few
flowers
three
and
a
half
trillion
all
right
let
it
go
at
that
out
came
his
chin
and
he
brought
one
fist
down
upon
the
other
as
though
he
were
cracking
rocks
with
a
hammer
and
with
every
blow
he
uttered
a
word
how
do
you
feed
them
all
x
loaves
and
fishes
without
a
word
myrin
drove
her
machine
toward
the
ground
and
as
before
estra
followed
despite
the
lack
of
any
visible
signal
within
a
minute
the
two
machines
had
come
to
rest
softly
and
without
disturbance
on
the
roof
of
a
handsome
building
much
like
an
apartment
house
there
was
the
usual
transparent
elevator
and
a
minute
later
the
four
were
being
introduced
to
the
occupants
of
a
typical
venusian
house
these
two
people
apparently
man
and
wife
did
not
need
to
be
told
why
the
explorers
had
been
brought
there
they
led
the
way
from
the
dimly
lighted
hallway
in
which
the
elevator
had
stopped
into
a
group
of
brightly
decorated
rooms
here
the
four
were
given
seats
in
the
usual
saddellike
chairs
and
then
myrin
answered
van
emmon
question
i
knew
that
this
point
would
arise
soon
and
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
handle
it
in
a
prearranged
fashion
i
will
admit
that
it
is
not
an
easy
question
van
emmon
has
put
not
because
the
answer
is
at
all
complicated
but
on
the
contrary
extremely
simple
the
four
were
listening
unanimously
despite
himself
van
emmon
was
highly
impressed
by
the
venusian
woman
serious
manner
perhaps
it
was
because
in
her
earnestness
she
was
not
quite
so
affable
as
before
she
went
on
from
where
you
are
sitting
you
can
see
all
the
rooms
in
this
house
you
will
look
in
vain
for
anything
even
remotely
resembling
a
kitchen
there
is
not
even
a
and
yet
you
must
not
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
we
all
use
restaurants
we
have
no
such
thing
as
a
public
eating
place
or
rather
and
here
she
spoke
very
carefully
rather
every
place
is
an
eating
place
the
doctor
looked
myrin
over
as
though
she
were
a
patient
with
a
new
kind
of
disease
you
do
not
mean
that
literally
of
course
said
he
kindly
but
she
nodded
gravely
you
must
not
misunderstand
remember
even
on
your
own
planet
the
distribution
of
food
is
becoming
more
and
more
extensive
until
you
can
now
buy
something
to
eat
at
every
crossroads
we
have
merely
carried
the
idea
to
its
logical
end
so
that
all
venusians
can
obtain
food
at
any
time
and
at
any
spot
she
turned
in
her
chair
all
the
chairs
on
venus
were
pivoted
estra
said
and
touched
a
button
in
the
wall
at
her
hand
a
panel
slid
noiselessly
aside
and
revealed
a
tiny
buffet
at
least
billie
labeled
it
a
buffet
for
want
of
a
more
accurate
term
for
it
consisted
of
a
silver
bibb
something
like
the
nozzle
of
a
water
fountain
above
which
was
a
board
containing
a
large
number
of
tiny
numbered
push
buttons
below
the
bibb
was
a
space
in
which
a
cup
might
be
set
and
projecting
from
a
tube
at
one
side
was
a
solid
block
of
telescoping
transparent
cups
this
said
myrin
is
the
venusian
nutrition
system
there
is
a
station
like
this
in
every
room
on
the
planet
and
she
proceeded
to
take
a
cup
from
the
tube
filling
each
from
the
silver
faucet
while
she
pressed
a
variety
of
the
buttons
the
four
watched
in
silence
and
eagerly
took
what
was
given
to
them
it
comprised
liquids
entirely
liquids
of
every
degree
of
fluidity
from
some
as
thin
as
water
to
others
as
thick
as
gruel
they
varied
even
more
as
to
color
ranging
from
actual
transparency
to
a
deep
chocolate
now
i
warn
you
not
to
be
shocked
said
myrin
although
i
fully
expect
that
you
will
be
the
fact
is
that
we
have
no
other
kind
of
food
than
what
you
see
there
are
thousands
upon
thousands
of
different
kinds
and
flavors
but
they
are
all
fluids
we
have
nothing
whatever
in
solid
form
you
see
she
explained
we
have
no
teeth
all
they
could
do
was
to
stare
at
her
as
with
a
return
of
her
smile
she
made
a
sudden
gesture
across
the
front
of
her
mouth
next
instant
a
set
of
false
teeth
lay
in
her
hand
estra
spoke
up
we
are
both
obliged
to
wear
them
in
order
that
we
might
use
your
language
he
removed
his
own
to
show
a
mouth
as
free
of
teeth
as
a
newborn
baby
both
venusians
replaced
their
sets
and
smiled
afresh
at
the
explorers
astonishment
teeth
will
soon
be
a
thing
of
the
past
with
you
on
the
earth
too
commented
myrin
kinney
will
surely
testify
to
that
your
use
of
soft
cooked
foods
instead
of
the
coarse
hard
articles
provided
by
nature
is
bound
to
have
this
effect
in
time
with
us
it
resulted
in
having
teeth
reduced
to
the
standing
of
your
appendix
and
like
you
we
resort
to
an
operation
rather
than
take
chances
on
trouble
i
may
mention
that
the
appendix
is
totally
absent
from
all
venusians
while
we
are
beginning
to
lose
all
traces
of
either
the
first
or
second
molars
just
as
you
are
beginning
to
lose
your
wisdom
teeth
however
suppose
you
try
our
diet
while
i
explain
the
four
once
more
looked
at
each
other
the
doctor
was
the
first
to
take
a
sip
of
one
of
the
cups
handed
to
him
and
van
emmon
was
the
last
the
geologist
waited
to
see
the
effects
upon
the
others
before
gingerly
tasting
of
the
thickest
darkest
liquid
of
them
all
another
taste
and
he
discovered
that
it
was
very
good
and
that
he
was
exceedingly
hungry
very
delicately
flavored
commented
billie
after
emptying
her
fourth
glass
a
golden
fluid
with
a
slightly
oily
appearance
delicately
is
right
said
the
doctor
this
stuff
is
barely
flavored
at
all
estra
the
venusian
was
also
eating
we
much
prefer
them
all
that
way
said
he
i
suppose
you
would
consider
our
tastes
very
finicky
on
earth
but
the
fact
is
we
are
able
to
distinguish
between
minute
variations
in
flavoring
such
as
would
escape
all
on
earth
except
a
i
suppose
remarked
the
doctor
smacking
his
lips
over
a
reddish
solution
with
a
winelike
flavor
i
suppose
we
can
expect
something
of
that
sort
on
the
earth
too
in
time
originally
mankind
was
only
able
to
distinguish
fresh
from
stale
and
animal
from
vegetable
flavors
after
a
while
myrin
went
on
you
know
the
processes
of
nutrition
as
they
take
place
among
your
people
are
extremely
wasteful
you
have
probably
heard
it
said
that
average
human
is
only
fifty
per
cent
efficient
that
simply
means
that
digestion
assimilation
and
excretion
require
half
the
energy
which
they
secure
from
the
food
now
the
articles
you
have
just
swallowed
require
very
little
work
on
the
part
of
your
digestive
apparatus
and
none
at
all
upon
your
eliminating
tract
the
food
is
almost
instantly
transformed
into
fresh
blood
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
already
feel
much
refreshed
this
was
decidedly
true
all
four
felt
actually
stimulated
van
emmon
instantly
suspected
the
food
of
being
alcoholic
as
he
continued
to
watch
its
effect
however
he
saw
that
there
was
no
harmful
reaction
as
in
the
case
of
the
notorious
drug
i
think
i
can
now
tell
you
how
we
produce
enough
food
for
the
three
and
a
half
trillion
of
us
despite
our
lack
of
farms
and
orchards
said
myrin
rising
returning
to
the
the
four
were
taken
a
short
distance
in
a
new
direction
and
again
descended
this
time
transferring
to
an
elevator
which
dropped
far
below
the
surface
they
came
to
a
stop
about
ten
floors
down
naturally
said
myrin
we
reserve
all
the
surface
for
residence
purposes
although
it
is
possible
to
live
down
here
in
comparative
comfort
since
we
have
plenty
of
electrical
energy
to
spare
and
she
operated
a
switch
flooding
the
place
with
a
brilliant
glow
thrown
from
concealed
sources
this
light
was
quite
as
strong
as
the
subdued
daylight
which
they
had
just
left
but
unless
we
were
free
to
fly
about
as
much
as
we
do
we
should
feel
that
life
was
a
bore
nobody
stays
below
any
longer
than
is
necessary
now
this
is
where
our
food
comes
from
whereupon
she
showed
them
a
series
of
automatic
machines
all
working
away
there
in
the
solid
rock
of
the
planet
and
of
such
an
extraordinary
nature
that
smith
the
engineer
moved
about
in
an
atmosphere
of
supreme
bliss
you
will
understand
said
myrin
that
the
usual
processes
of
nutrition
on
the
earth
depend
entirely
upon
plant
life
we
however
can
not
spare
room
enough
for
any
such
system
so
we
had
to
devise
substitutes
for
plants
in
effect
that
is
what
these
machines
are
they
convert
into
loam
take
the
nitrates
and
other
chemicals
footnote
the
geology
of
venus
is
thoroughly
described
in
van
emmon
reports
to
the
e
a
directly
from
this
artificial
soil
and
by
a
process
secure
results
similar
to
those
produced
by
roots
likewise
we
have
developed
artificial
leaves
pointing
out
a
huge
apparatus
which
none
but
a
highly
trained
expert
in
both
botany
and
mechanics
could
half
understood
this
machine
first
manufactures
chlorophyl
yes
it
does
as
the
doctor
snorted
incredulously
not
an
imitation
but
real
chlorophyl
and
then
transforms
the
various
elements
into
starch
sugar
and
proteids
through
the
agency
of
the
sunlight
recovered
from
the
granite
in
short
to
answer
your
question
van
emmon
as
to
how
we
are
all
fed
we
do
not
grow
our
food
at
all
we
go
straight
to
the
practically
unlimited
supply
of
raw
materials
under
our
feet
and
manufacture
our
food
outright
xi
the
billie
was
very
quiet
during
their
return
to
the
surface
she
said
nothing
until
they
had
reached
the
two
cars
and
then
pausing
as
she
was
about
to
step
in
she
said
well
i
never
saw
our
old
friend
the
high
cost
of
living
handled
quite
so
easily
if
that
the
way
you
do
things
here
estra
and
the
girl
did
not
flinch
at
the
gazes
the
others
turned
upon
her
if
that
your
way
it
good
enough
for
me
i
going
to
stay
for
the
first
time
estra
looked
astonished
he
and
myrin
exchanged
lightninglike
glances
then
the
venusian
face
warmed
with
the
smile
he
gave
the
architect
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
say
that
he
said
impressively
i
was
afraid
some
of
our
peculiarities
might
arouse
very
different
feelings
they
stared
at
one
another
for
a
second
or
two
long
enough
for
the
doctor
to
notice
and
to
see
how
van
emmon
took
it
the
geologist
however
was
smiling
upon
the
girl
in
a
fashion
which
indicated
that
he
thought
she
did
mean
what
she
had
said
had
he
been
looking
up
at
her
however
instead
of
down
upon
her
he
would
have
seen
that
her
chin
was
most
resolute
just
as
they
were
about
to
start
again
both
estra
and
myrin
stopped
short
in
their
tracks
with
that
odd
hesitation
that
had
mystified
the
four
all
along
and
after
perhaps
five
seconds
of
silence
turned
to
one
another
with
grave
faces
it
was
estra
who
explained
it
is
curious
how
things
do
pile
up
said
he
a
little
conscious
of
having
employed
an
idiom
our
planet
has
gone
along
for
hundreds
of
generations
without
anything
especially
remarkable
happening
so
that
recently
many
prophets
have
foretold
a
number
of
startling
events
to
take
place
on
a
single
day
and
this
seems
to
have
come
true
you
have
been
with
us
scarcely
ten
hours
and
the
visitors
stared
at
each
other
in
amazement
that
so
much
time
had
passed
scarcely
ten
hours
and
here
comes
an
announcement
which
for
over
a
hundred
years
has
been
looked
forward
to
with
he
stopped
abruptly
the
doctor
gently
took
him
up
forward
to
with
what
estra
estra
and
myrin
considered
this
for
perhaps
three
seconds
it
was
the
woman
who
replied
the
fact
is
your
approach
to
the
planet
has
stimulated
all
sorts
of
research
immensely
matters
that
had
been
hanging
fire
indefinitely
were
revived
this
is
one
of
them
in
that
sense
you
are
to
blame
but
she
smiled
as
reassuringly
as
she
could
allowing
for
a
certain
anxiety
which
had
now
come
to
her
face
do
you
think
you
could
make
it
clear
to
us
asked
billie
encouragingly
at
the
same
time
all
four
noted
that
the
air
which
before
had
fairly
thronged
with
machines
was
now
simply
alive
with
them
people
were
flitting
here
and
there
like
swarms
of
insects
and
with
as
little
apparent
aim
both
estra
and
myrin
were
extra
watchful
also
they
displayed
a
certain
eagerness
to
get
away
setting
their
course
in
still
another
direction
in
a
minute
or
two
the
congestion
seemed
relieved
and
myrin
began
to
talk
slowly
you
have
doubtless
guessed
by
this
time
that
we
venusians
have
crossed
what
some
call
animal
divide
we
are
predominatly
intellectual
while
you
on
the
earth
are
as
a
race
still
predominantly
animal
excuse
me
for
putting
it
so
bluntly
it
all
right
said
the
doctor
with
an
effort
what
you
say
is
true
of
most
of
us
he
added
most
thinking
people
realize
that
when
our
civilization
reaches
the
point
where
the
getting
of
a
living
becomes
secondary
instead
of
primary
as
at
present
a
great
change
is
bound
to
come
to
the
race
the
venusian
nodded
under
the
conditions
which
now
surround
us
you
can
see
we
have
vastly
more
time
for
what
you
would
call
spiritual
matters
only
we
label
them
psychological
experiences
in
fact
the
is
the
venusian
daily
business
there
was
another
pause
during
which
both
venusians
driving
at
high
speed
though
they
were
once
more
closed
their
eyes
for
a
second
or
so
estra
evidently
thought
it
time
to
explain
for
instance
with
us
it
takes
the
place
of
wireless
for
we
have
developed
the
power
to
such
a
point
that
any
venusian
can
up
any
other
no
matter
where
either
may
be
that
is
why
we
need
no
signs
or
addresses
there
are
certain
restrictions
for
instance
no
one
can
read
another
thoughts
without
his
permission
of
course
we
still
have
speech
speech
and
language
are
the
abc
of
the
venusian
and
we
still
keep
the
telephone
for
the
sake
of
checking
up
now
and
then
just
now
we
are
driving
for
my
own
house
where
there
is
apparatus
which
will
enable
you
to
both
hear
and
understand
an
announcement
which
is
shortly
to
be
made
there
was
something
decidedly
satisfying
especially
to
van
emmon
in
being
taken
into
the
venusian
confidence
to
this
extent
when
he
put
his
question
it
was
with
his
former
aggressiveness
much
modified
he
said
i
should
think
that
your
people
have
pretty
well
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
the
supernatural
by
this
time
progress
having
come
to
an
end
i
do
see
what
you
find
to
interest
you
myrin
the
fact
is
billie
put
in
we
feel
somewhat
disappointed
that
your
people
have
shown
so
little
interest
in
us
and
she
gave
a
sidelong
glance
at
estra
who
returned
the
look
with
a
direct
smiling
gaze
which
sent
a
flood
of
color
into
the
architect
face
look
out
sharply
from
van
emmon
and
with
barely
an
inch
to
spare
estra
steered
his
car
past
another
which
he
had
nearly
overlooked
for
another
minute
or
two
there
was
silence
then
myrin
said
you
wonder
what
there
is
to
interest
us
and
yet
every
time
you
look
up
at
the
stars
the
answer
is
before
your
eyes
you
see
although
we
can
not
read
your
thoughts
without
your
permission
yet
you
on
the
earth
can
not
prevent
us
from
anything
that
may
be
said
under
proper
conditions
our
psychic
senses
are
delicate
enough
to
feel
the
slightest
whisper
on
the
earth
that
is
why
estra
and
i
are
able
to
use
your
language
we
have
learned
it
together
with
an
understanding
of
your
lives
and
customs
by
simply
in
i
may
add
that
we
are
also
able
to
use
your
eyes
we
knew
directly
what
you
people
looked
like
before
you
arrived
well
it
is
our
ambition
to
visit
in
spirit
every
planet
in
the
universe
there
are
hundreds
of
millions
of
stars
every
one
is
a
sun
and
each
has
planets
one
in
a
hundred
contains
life
some
very
elementary
others
much
more
advanced
than
we
are
so
far
we
have
been
able
to
study
nearly
two
thousand
worlds
besides
those
in
this
solar
system
do
you
still
think
friend
we
have
nothing
to
interest
us
she
raised
a
hand
in
a
gesture
of
emphasis
and
it
was
then
that
billie
her
eyes
on
myrin
fingers
saw
another
sign
of
the
great
advancement
these
people
had
made
direct
proof
in
fact
of
what
myrin
had
just
claimed
for
there
must
have
been
a
tremendous
gain
in
the
intellect
to
have
caused
such
a
drain
upon
the
body
as
billie
saw
in
no
other
way
could
it
be
explained
the
minds
of
the
venusians
had
grown
at
a
fearful
cost
to
flesh
and
blood
not
only
were
the
fingernails
entirely
lacking
from
myrin
hand
but
the
lower
joints
of
her
four
fingers
from
the
palm
to
the
knuckles
were
grown
smoothly
together
xii
the
mental
limit
make
yourselves
at
home
said
estra
as
they
stepped
into
his
apartment
the
cars
just
filled
his
balcony
this
is
my
see
if
you
can
guess
my
occupation
from
what
you
see
as
for
myrin
and
myself
we
must
make
certain
preparations
before
the
announcement
is
made
they
disappeared
and
the
four
inspected
the
place
as
in
the
other
house
they
had
entered
the
room
was
provided
with
a
double
row
of
small
windows
some
being
down
near
the
floor
and
the
others
level
with
the
eyes
these
in
addition
to
two
doors
all
of
which
were
of
translucent
material
on
low
benches
about
the
room
were
a
number
of
instruments
some
of
which
looked
familiar
to
the
doctor
he
said
he
had
seen
something
much
like
them
in
psychology
class
during
his
college
days
for
the
most
part
their
appearance
defied
ordinary
description
footnote
physicians
biologists
and
others
interested
in
matters
of
this
nature
will
find
the
above
fully
treated
in
kinney
reports
to
the
m
a
but
one
piece
of
apparatus
was
given
such
prominence
that
it
is
worth
detailing
it
consisted
of
a
hollow
metal
framework
about
a
foot
in
either
direction
upon
which
was
mounted
about
forty
long
all
pointing
toward
the
inside
of
the
frame
the
inner
ends
of
the
screws
were
provided
with
small
silver
pads
while
the
outer
ends
were
so
connected
each
with
a
tiny
dial
as
to
register
the
amount
of
motion
of
the
screw
smith
turned
one
of
them
in
and
out
and
said
it
reminded
him
of
a
micrometer
gage
then
billie
noted
that
the
entire
device
was
so
placed
upon
the
bench
as
to
set
directly
over
a
hole
about
ten
inches
in
diameter
and
under
the
bench
was
one
of
the
saddlelike
chairs
the
architect
antiquarian
lore
came
back
to
her
with
a
rush
and
she
remembered
something
she
had
seen
in
a
museum
a
relic
of
the
inquisition
good
heavens
she
whispered
what
is
this
an
instrument
of
torture
it
certainly
looked
mightily
like
one
of
the
devices
billie
had
seen
and
all
this
appeared
to
be
only
a
very
elaborate
persuader
for
use
upon
those
who
must
be
made
to
talk
but
the
doctor
was
thinking
hard
a
big
light
flashed
into
his
eyes
this
he
declared
positively
is
something
that
will
become
a
matter
of
course
in
our
own
educational
system
as
soon
as
the
science
of
phrenology
is
better
understood
and
next
second
he
had
ducked
under
the
bench
and
thrust
his
head
through
the
round
hole
so
that
his
skull
was
brought
into
contact
with
some
of
those
padded
get
the
idea
he
finished
it
a
it
did
not
take
smith
long
to
reach
the
next
conclusion
then
said
he
our
friend
estra
is
connected
with
their
school
system
ca
say
what
he
would
be
called
but
i
should
say
his
function
is
to
measure
the
capacity
of
students
for
various
kinds
of
knowledge
in
order
that
their
education
may
be
adapted
accordingly
might
call
him
a
he
concluded
or
a
added
the
geologist
deprecatingly
rather
a
indignantly
from
billie
people
look
to
him
to
suggest
what
they
should
take
up
and
what
they
should
leave
alone
why
he
one
of
the
most
important
men
on
this
whole
planet
and
again
the
doctor
was
a
witness
to
a
clash
of
eyes
between
the
girl
and
the
geologist
van
emmon
said
nothing
further
however
but
turned
to
examine
an
immense
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
this
case
had
shelves
scarcely
two
inches
apart
and
about
half
as
deep
and
held
perhaps
half
a
million
extremely
small
books
each
comprised
many
hundreds
of
pages
made
of
a
perfectly
opaque
material
of
such
incredible
thinness
that
ordinary
resembled
cardboard
by
comparison
they
were
printed
much
the
same
as
any
other
book
except
that
the
characters
were
of
microscopic
size
and
the
lines
extremely
close
together
also
in
some
of
the
books
these
lines
were
black
and
red
alternating
billie
eagerly
examined
one
of
the
diminutive
volumes
under
a
strong
glass
and
pronounced
the
characters
not
unlike
ancient
gothic
type
she
guessed
that
the
language
was
synthetic
like
roman
or
esperanto
and
that
the
alphabet
numbered
sixty
or
seventy
the
red
lines
she
added
not
so
confidently
are
in
a
different
language
looks
wonderfully
like
persian
by
this
time
the
others
were
doing
the
same
as
she
and
marveling
to
note
that
wherever
the
red
and
black
lines
were
employed
invariably
the
black
were
in
the
same
language
while
the
red
characters
were
totally
different
in
each
book
suddenly
smith
gave
a
start
so
vigorously
that
the
other
turned
in
alarm
he
was
holding
one
of
the
books
as
though
it
were
white
hot
look
he
stuttered
excitedly
just
look
at
it
and
no
wonder
in
the
book
he
had
chanced
to
pick
up
the
red
lines
were
printed
in
english
talk
about
your
finds
exclaimed
billie
in
an
tone
why
this
library
is
a
literal
translation
of
the
languages
of
she
fairly
gasped
as
she
recalled
myrin
words
thousands
of
planets
after
that
she
fell
silent
plainly
the
discovery
had
profoundly
affected
and
strengthened
her
notion
of
remaining
on
the
planet
van
emmon
watching
her
narrowly
saw
her
give
the
room
an
appraising
glance
which
meant
plain
as
day
i
like
to
keep
this
place
in
spick
and
span
condition
and
another
not
so
easy
to
interpret
i
like
to
show
these
people
a
thing
or
two
about
designing
houses
and
the
geologist
heart
sank
for
an
instant
he
turned
resolutely
to
the
bookcase
and
shortly
found
something
which
he
showed
to
the
doctor
it
was
a
book
printed
all
in
venusian
they
carefully
translated
the
using
one
of
the
interlinear
english
books
as
a
guide
and
saw
that
it
was
a
complete
on
astral
development
with
these
instructions
the
doctor
declared
any
one
could
do
as
the
venusians
do
visit
other
worlds
in
spirit
just
then
estra
and
myrin
returned
they
were
moving
at
what
was
for
them
a
rapid
pace
and
to
all
appearances
they
were
rather
excited
we
were
not
able
to
make
these
records
as
perfect
as
we
would
like
said
estra
holding
up
four
disks
similar
to
the
ones
which
still
lay
in
the
explorers
translating
machines
he
proceeded
to
open
the
little
black
cases
and
make
the
exchange
there
will
be
words
used
which
i
did
not
see
fit
to
incorporate
in
the
original
vocabulary
but
which
you
will
have
to
understand
perfectly
if
this
announcement
is
to
mean
anything
to
you
thank
you
said
the
doctor
quietly
and
now
do
you
think
we
had
best
know
in
advance
just
what
is
to
be
the
subject
of
hush
whispered
estra
and
next
second
they
were
listening
to
the
telephone
in
amazement
xiii
the
war
of
the
sexes
in
accordance
with
my
promise
stated
a
effeminate
voice
i
am
going
to
demonstrate
a
juvenation
method
upon
which
i
have
worked
for
the
past
one
hundred
and
years
there
was
a
brief
pause
during
which
estra
hurriedly
explained
that
the
man
who
was
making
the
speech
was
located
far
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
in
a
hall
like
the
one
the
four
had
first
visited
and
that
he
was
making
the
demonstration
before
a
great
gathering
of
scientists
too
bad
you
can
not
see
as
we
do
commented
the
venusian
however
savarona
may
go
into
the
details
of
if
the
committeemen
are
entirely
finished
with
their
measurements
stated
the
unseen
experimenter
i
would
like
to
have
the
results
compared
with
the
recorded
figures
of
pario
camenol
who
was
born
on
the
two
hundred
and
fifteenth
day
of
the
year
thousand
seven
hundred
and
four
another
rest
and
estra
said
they
are
examining
a
boy
who
appears
to
be
about
twelve
years
of
age
then
came
other
voices
as
we
all
know
the
craniums
of
us
all
are
absolutely
distinct
as
much
so
as
our
the
measurements
correspond
identically
with
those
of
pario
camenol
beyond
a
doubt
this
boy
can
be
none
other
than
pario
then
the
voice
went
on
then
notice
the
formula
i
have
written
on
this
blackboard
using
this
solution
i
have
supplied
nourishment
to
this
lad
from
the
hour
of
his
birth
until
a
few
days
ago
i
was
not
satisfied
with
the
results
the
patient
showed
a
tiny
variation
from
the
allowable
subconscious
maximum
together
with
only
the
required
motor
reaction
but
i
have
corrected
this
briefly
i
have
incorporated
in
pario
camenol
standard
diet
certain
elements
which
have
hitherto
been
unsafe
to
combine
these
elements
are
derivatives
of
the
potash
group
for
the
most
part
together
with
phosphates
which
need
a
new
classification
their
effect
impressively
has
been
to
postpone
age
indefinitely
there
must
have
been
a
tremendous
sensation
in
that
hall
the
voice
shook
with
excitement
as
he
went
on
we
have
sought
in
vain
friends
for
a
way
to
cheat
death
of
his
due
we
have
succeeded
in
postponing
his
advent
until
our
average
longevity
is
several
times
greater
than
on
our
neighboring
planet
but
so
far
it
has
been
a
mere
reprieve
what
i
have
done
is
to
prevent
age
itself
this
lad
is
a
hundred
and
years
old
mentally
and
still
only
twelve
years
old
as
to
body
in
short
i
offer
you
the
fountain
of
youth
itself
the
speaker
paused
there
was
no
comment
evidently
all
had
been
as
greatly
impressed
as
the
explorers
then
the
voice
of
the
man
savarona
finished
very
deliberately
i
regret
to
say
that
my
treatment
despite
all
that
i
have
been
able
to
do
can
not
be
adapted
to
the
female
constitution
it
would
be
fatal
to
any
but
males
i
repeat
i
can
offer
eternal
youth
absolutely
but
only
to
males
this
time
there
was
a
definite
response
from
the
telephone
came
a
confused
murmuring
at
which
van
emmon
face
lighted
up
with
delight
the
murmuring
had
an
angry
sound
this
is
outrageous
a
loud
contralto
voice
was
raised
above
the
rest
you
are
unethical
savarona
to
announce
such
a
thing
before
adapting
it
to
both
sexes
the
voice
replied
shortly
and
with
more
than
a
hint
of
malice
if
a
woman
had
discovered
this
instead
of
me
i
dare
say
you
would
have
no
objections
the
murmuring
grew
louder
angrier
more
confused
the
four
from
the
earth
looked
at
each
other
in
some
slight
uneasiness
at
the
same
time
they
noted
that
estra
his
eyes
tightly
closed
and
his
fists
clenched
in
the
intensity
of
his
concentration
suddenly
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
next
second
he
began
to
speak
into
the
telephone
in
a
voice
so
loud
as
to
silence
all
the
clamor
savarona
and
the
people
of
venus
listen
the
prophets
were
right
when
they
said
today
would
witness
many
great
things
i
have
just
learned
of
another
experiment
which
transcends
even
that
of
savarona
an
instant
pause
then
first
let
me
remind
you
that
we
have
been
doing
all
we
could
to
elevate
our
spiritual
selves
we
are
daily
trying
to
eliminate
all
that
is
animal
all
that
is
gross
and
bemeaning
in
us
even
to
the
extent
of
reducing
the
flavors
of
our
foods
to
the
lowest
tolerable
point
and
despite
all
this
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
rid
of
sex
jealousy
we
still
have
the
beast
within
us
no
matter
how
pure
our
love
may
be
it
is
always
tainted
with
rivalry
always
the
husband
and
wife
are
held
down
by
this
mutual
envy
forever
dragging
at
their
heels
constantly
holding
them
back
from
the
lofty
heights
of
spiritual
power
to
which
they
aspire
he
paused
and
savarona
voice
broke
in
triumphantly
you
are
right
estra
you
are
right
except
you
did
not
mention
that
this
jealousy
becomes
less
and
less
as
one
grows
older
now
my
discovery
will
put
an
end
to
your
beast
estra
my
experiments
took
this
lad
before
he
had
become
a
man
and
allowed
his
brain
to
develop
while
his
body
stopped
growing
he
is
a
man
in
mentality
and
an
innocent
boy
in
body
estra
i
have
done
the
thing
you
wish
this
boy
will
never
know
jealousy
because
he
will
never
know
love
the
man
in
the
room
with
the
four
answered
in
a
flash
so
you
have
savarona
but
only
for
men
no
female
can
benefit
by
what
you
have
done
but
i
tell
you
that
within
the
past
few
minutes
a
child
has
been
born
under
circumstances
which
can
be
repeated
at
any
time
and
for
any
sex
in
this
case
the
venusian
voice
changed
curiously
in
this
case
however
it
was
a
girl
for
the
mother
controlled
the
sex
in
the
customary
manner
at
this
the
doctor
interest
became
acute
at
the
same
time
the
other
three
felt
a
tremendous
inexplicable
thrill
friends
and
extra
face
shone
in
his
enthusiasm
friends
for
the
first
time
in
creation
the
human
male
germ
has
been
dispensed
with
the
intellect
has
done
what
the
laboratory
could
not
do
i
have
the
honor
to
announce
that
my
sister
amra
has
just
given
birth
his
voice
fairly
rang
has
just
given
birth
to
a
girl
baby
whose
only
father
was
her
mother
brain
xiv
estra
this
time
there
was
no
drowning
the
confusion
the
telephone
fairly
shook
with
innumerable
cries
shouts
imprecations
the
four
gave
up
trying
to
hear
and
watched
the
two
venusians
myrin
was
facing
estra
now
her
expression
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
its
good
humor
and
there
was
a
certain
sharpness
in
her
voice
as
she
exclaimed
estra
if
your
sister
has
done
this
and
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
it
then
she
has
made
man
superfluous
if
women
can
produce
children
mechanically
and
govern
the
sex
at
will
the
coming
race
need
be
nothing
but
females
estra
nodded
gravely
that
is
what
it
amounts
to
myrin
for
a
moment
the
two
stared
at
one
another
challengingly
on
the
earth
their
attitude
would
have
indicated
some
unimportant
tiff
none
would
have
dreamed
that
the
most
momentous
question
in
their
lives
had
come
up
and
had
found
them
at
outs
next
instant
myrin
turned
and
without
another
word
walked
from
the
room
estra
followed
slowly
to
the
door
where
he
stood
looking
after
her
with
an
expression
of
the
keenest
concern
on
his
sensitive
strung
features
the
three
men
from
the
earth
after
a
glance
studiously
avoided
looking
at
him
but
billie
walked
up
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
are
you
really
in
favor
of
this
scheme
she
inquired
in
a
curiously
tender
voice
at
the
same
time
she
gazed
intently
into
estra
eyes
he
turned
and
the
smile
came
back
to
his
face
he
took
billie
hand
and
laid
it
between
both
his
own
his
voice
was
even
gentler
than
before
most
certainly
i
do
favor
my
sister
method
billie
it
will
be
the
greatest
boon
the
race
has
ever
known
we
can
look
forward
now
and
his
face
shone
again
can
look
forward
to
generation
upon
generation
of
people
whose
spirituality
will
be
absolute
the
girl
moved
closer
to
him
she
spoke
with
feverish
earnestness
there
may
be
some
hitch
in
the
idea
estra
if
god
meant
for
man
to
become
to
become
obsolete
he
would
not
have
hidden
the
method
all
this
time
suppose
some
flaw
should
develop
later
on
in
the
cube
billie
jackson
would
not
have
stumbled
over
such
a
speech
she
would
have
ignored
the
fact
that
estra
was
holding
her
hand
all
this
time
and
gazing
deep
into
her
eyes
she
would
have
been
filled
with
what
she
was
saying
and
not
with
what
she
was
seeing
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
van
emmon
watched
and
glowered
he
could
not
hear
the
venusian
lifted
his
head
suddenly
the
voices
from
the
telephone
had
subsided
only
an
occasional
outburst
came
from
the
instrument
estra
closed
his
eyes
again
for
a
second
and
when
he
opened
them
again
his
manner
was
astonishingly
alert
and
his
speech
swift
and
to
the
point
so
far
as
we
know
billie
the
method
has
no
flaws
it
gives
us
the
chance
to
throw
off
our
lower
selves
and
if
by
so
doing
we
reduce
the
race
to
a
single
sex
only
he
stopped
short
as
though
at
a
sound
and
with
a
word
of
apology
stepped
from
the
room
he
opened
another
door
far
down
the
corridor
and
as
he
passed
through
the
wail
of
a
infant
came
faintly
to
the
four
wonder
what
up
said
smith
van
emmon
who
had
gone
to
the
window
whirled
upon
the
engineer
and
motioned
him
to
his
side
look
at
the
people
smith
saw
that
the
nearby
houses
were
almost
concealed
by
a
throng
which
had
gathered
silently
and
without
confusion
during
the
past
few
minutes
their
numbers
were
increasing
swiftly
fresh
arrivals
packing
the
background
people
filled
the
streets
the
space
below
balcony
was
already
crowded
as
closely
as
it
could
be
except
for
a
voiced
buzzing
there
was
no
disturbance
billie
came
up
she
seemed
to
divine
the
temper
of
the
mob
she
caught
her
breath
sharply
and
then
said
very
simply
it
reminds
me
of
bethlehem
but
the
words
had
scarcely
left
her
mouth
before
an
uproar
sounded
from
one
end
of
the
street
below
a
crowd
of
excited
venusians
was
pushing
its
way
determinedly
toward
the
house
their
passage
obstructed
by
shouting
protesting
individuals
van
emmon
breast
began
to
heave
he
fancied
he
saw
blows
struck
by
george
he
exclaimed
next
second
they
fighting
it
was
true
a
battle
was
going
on
less
than
a
block
away
the
people
below
the
window
surged
in
the
direction
of
the
fight
all
were
shouting
now
the
clamor
was
deafening
live
and
let
live
came
one
of
the
shouts
it
was
taken
up
by
the
group
that
was
doing
the
attacking
and
made
into
a
cheer
then
came
other
cries
from
them
smith
made
out
something
like
down
with
sex
monopoly
do
you
see
shouted
smith
above
the
din
these
people
below
are
estra
friends
those
newcomers
are
backing
savarona
get
the
idea
he
repeated
if
estra
wins
out
the
old
boy
with
the
fountain
of
youth
will
never
get
another
boy
baby
to
experiment
on
what
the
doctor
leaped
to
their
sides
he
took
it
in
at
a
glance
then
whirled
to
the
door
we
ought
to
warn
estra
he
knows
it
already
reminded
billie
swiftly
a
great
shout
came
from
below
the
attackers
had
forced
their
way
through
the
crowd
of
friends
well
van
emmon
stood
squarely
in
the
middle
of
the
room
so
far
as
i
concerned
estra
and
his
sister
can
face
that
crowd
alone
i
approve
of
the
scheme
the
doctor
eyed
him
thoughtfully
i
not
so
sure
van
this
is
a
tremendous
thing
we
ought
to
van
is
right
exploded
billie
her
voice
rose
to
a
shriek
as
a
crash
shook
the
house
next
instant
myrin
for
once
in
a
hurry
broke
into
the
room
she
glanced
about
missed
estra
looked
slightly
puzzled
and
then
frowned
angrily
as
the
venusian
himself
stepped
in
you
fooled
me
she
shot
at
him
but
he
smiled
apologetically
he
was
carrying
a
large
package
of
leaflets
closely
printed
in
venusian
there
seemed
to
be
several
thousand
in
the
lot
he
said
by
way
of
explanation
i
had
to
get
ready
savarona
people
will
be
here
any
moment
they
have
destroyed
the
elevator
and
a
wave
of
clamor
burst
from
below
they
broken
the
barrier
remarked
estra
calmly
he
turned
to
the
door
then
whirled
at
a
crash
which
sounded
from
above
through
the
roof
he
added
he
did
not
even
glance
at
the
balcony
where
the
two
cars
barred
the
way
against
any
attack
from
that
direction
next
second
he
again
quit
the
room
myrin
hesitated
a
moment
irresolute
and
then
followed
him
thoughtfully
they
never
saw
her
again
as
for
estra
he
came
back
in
a
moment
carrying
a
small
white
bundle
which
stirred
in
his
arms
he
unhesitatingly
handed
the
child
to
billie
his
mouth
moved
soundlessly
as
a
muffled
shriek
arose
from
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
there
was
a
thud
a
metallic
crash
and
a
great
roar
of
voices
the
mob
had
broken
in
and
up
through
the
back
of
the
house
the
first
of
the
attackers
thrust
his
head
and
shoulders
into
sight
not
ten
feet
away
estra
touched
something
with
his
foot
and
a
door
shot
across
the
corridor
there
was
an
instant
silence
then
the
thunder
of
the
mob
hurling
itself
against
the
door
the
people
were
fairly
snarling
now
estra
closed
the
inner
door
estra
shrilly
from
billie
she
laid
the
baby
down
and
strode
to
the
venusian
let
get
out
of
here
the
car
on
the
balcony
nobody
in
the
way
to
interfere
why
not
a
grinding
ripping
jar
from
above
and
estra
shook
his
head
the
smile
was
gone
and
his
mouth
was
set
and
grim
they
catch
us
before
we
went
a
mile
he
said
glancing
at
the
infant
who
had
begun
to
cry
in
a
stifled
gasping
way
that
tore
at
the
nerves
estra
billie
pleaded
but
he
turned
away
the
doctor
strode
up
to
him
and
gripped
his
shoulder
what
the
good
estra
what
can
you
accomplish
even
if
you
the
venusian
tapped
his
forehead
i
can
tell
he
exclaimed
with
a
return
of
that
exalted
flush
just
give
me
a
chance
to
offer
my
sister
discovery
to
the
world
and
i
shall
be
satisfied
he
touched
the
package
of
leaflets
these
are
not
written
as
clearly
as
they
should
be
but
if
i
can
not
hold
them
back
then
these
fingering
the
papers
these
go
to
the
friends
down
below
he
moved
closer
to
the
window
but
his
eyes
were
on
the
door
a
rending
crash
told
that
the
corridor
was
now
open
to
the
mob
there
was
a
rush
and
then
the
storm
of
the
people
battering
the
last
door
van
doc
billie
smith
had
the
window
open
and
was
stepping
into
one
of
the
cars
kinney
and
the
geologist
were
at
his
side
in
an
instant
the
girl
held
back
estra
she
begged
she
picked
up
the
baby
and
with
her
free
hand
tugged
at
the
venusian
arm
come
on
do
sacrifice
yourself
the
door
bulged
under
the
attack
the
noise
was
nevertheless
estra
heard
and
shook
his
head
without
looking
at
the
woman
from
the
earth
she
dashed
to
the
window
then
came
back
hurry
there
a
chance
he
stood
unmoved
watchful
and
ready
estra
i
want
you
to
come
her
face
flamed
ca
you
see
ca
you
see
that
i
i
want
you
she
gasped
as
the
door
shrieked
under
the
strain
come
if
you
a
man
the
venusian
face
changed
he
turned
and
stared
at
the
girl
with
eyes
that
held
nothing
but
blank
amazement
the
grimness
left
his
mouth
his
lips
partly
opened
he
took
a
step
forward
and
threw
an
arm
about
her
shoulders
billie
i
sorry
i
never
thought
a
crack
showed
at
the
edge
of
the
door
and
a
roar
smote
their
ears
estra
backed
to
the
window
go
he
shouted
go
quickly
while
you
can
billie
stood
stock
still
gazing
at
him
i
going
to
stay
she
screamed
i
take
my
chances
with
he
thrust
her
through
the
window
you
do
understand
he
shouted
and
took
the
baby
away
from
her
despite
all
her
strength
then
a
wonderfully
tender
light
came
into
his
eyes
he
gripped
billie
hands
and
spoke
sorrowfully
billie
i
not
what
you
thought
i
not
a
man
i
a
woman
xv
back
by
the
time
smith
had
driven
the
strange
craft
fifty
yards
he
had
it
under
control
billie
glanced
back
estra
was
out
on
the
balcony
now
and
the
mob
was
surging
against
the
windows
she
had
locked
against
them
she
shifted
the
baby
to
the
hollow
of
one
arm
while
with
the
other
she
broke
the
cord
of
the
packet
at
the
sight
the
crowd
in
the
street
gave
voice
let
us
have
it
they
were
crying
they
drowned
out
the
uproar
within
the
house
estra
did
not
even
look
at
the
other
car
then
the
windows
gave
way
like
the
breaking
of
a
dam
a
flood
of
venusians
poured
and
tumbled
at
estra
feet
she
raised
her
hand
and
shouted
something
billie
could
not
hear
then
scarcely
without
pause
the
crowd
bore
down
upon
her
and
even
as
she
was
crushed
against
the
railing
with
one
hand
she
dropped
the
baby
to
eager
upstretched
arms
below
and
with
the
other
she
tossed
the
package
high
in
the
air
there
it
broke
apart
the
air
caught
it
and
the
thousands
of
leaflets
fluttered
down
upon
that
street
full
of
sympathizers
leaflets
each
of
which
described
a
discovery
which
was
to
give
to
women
the
power
of
abolishing
the
opposite
sex
of
making
venus
a
world
not
only
one
in
country
one
in
industry
and
one
in
thought
but
one
in
sex
the
thunderous
meaning
of
estra
last
action
almost
made
billie
forget
that
it
was
in
truth
the
woman
last
act
for
next
moment
her
lifeless
form
was
being
crushed
beneath
the
feet
of
that
supremely
cultured
marvelously
civilized
mob
for
it
was
only
a
mob
despite
its
astounding
advancement
a
mob
which
had
retained
all
the
fanaticism
and
all
the
male
jealousy
of
the
female
for
they
were
all
men
the
four
had
been
on
venus
almost
hours
when
smith
knowing
the
condition
of
the
machinery
in
the
cube
warned
the
others
that
they
must
return
secretly
he
was
tired
of
the
venusians
continual
smiling
for
they
had
fairly
outdone
each
other
to
show
the
visitors
all
that
could
be
shown
but
it
was
van
emmon
who
thought
to
ask
for
wonderful
library
these
chemicals
and
metals
you
are
giving
us
he
said
making
a
regular
speech
of
it
are
extremely
welcome
they
will
enable
us
to
perform
experiments
otherwise
out
of
our
reach
but
estra
books
will
mean
still
more
to
the
people
of
the
earth
if
there
is
no
one
else
with
more
need
for
them
who
is
going
to
put
in
a
claim
then
why
not
let
us
have
them
apparently
the
venusians
did
not
like
the
idea
very
well
they
must
have
thought
it
was
like
letting
a
monkey
play
with
a
rifle
the
doctor
afterward
put
it
but
for
lack
of
a
leader
with
any
motive
for
objecting
and
because
estra
had
no
living
relatives
to
claim
the
library
somehow
that
incredible
collection
of
intellectual
gems
got
into
the
possession
of
the
four
nothing
was
said
about
it
during
the
quiet
and
when
the
cube
finally
rose
away
from
the
roof
van
emmon
face
beamed
with
happiness
and
a
great
sigh
of
satisfaction
escaped
him
well
looking
at
the
books
they
kind
of
make
up
for
the
fact
that
the
folks
did
ask
us
to
call
again
and
he
turned
and
went
straight
to
the
kitchenette
where
he
proceeded
with
great
speed
and
efficiency
to
set
out
the
following
canned
soup
canned
baked
beans
fried
bacon
and
egg
coffee
peaches
come
and
get
it
he
shouted
the
doctor
tore
himself
away
from
the
books
smith
crawled
out
from
the
beloved
machines
billie
came
out
shortly
from
her
and
slipped
into
her
seat
in
a
highly
excited
manner
there
was
a
brightness
in
her
cheeks
and
a
noticeable
change
in
her
usually
assured
manner
this
timidity
so
utterly
new
to
the
girl
seemed
most
pronounced
whenever
van
emmon
chanced
to
look
at
her
which
was
quite
often
all
four
were
ravenous
they
had
been
away
from
the
cube
a
day
and
a
night
and
all
we
had
to
eat
was
something
to
drink
as
smith
complained
nothing
whatever
was
said
except
please
pass
that
and
thanks
for
fully
fifteen
minutes
at
last
they
were
satisfied
the
doctor
went
back
to
the
books
smith
returned
to
his
and
wrench
but
billie
stood
by
the
table
and
began
helping
van
emmon
to
clear
up
in
a
moment
they
were
face
to
face
van
she
said
softly
and
looked
up
at
him
wistfully
van
do
you
like
me
better
this
way
her
eyes
were
almost
piteous
into
the
man
face
there
came
a
look
of
amazement
followed
by
one
of
admiration
and
another
of
genuine
delight
he
gave
a
little
laugh
and
unconsciously
threw
out
his
hands
much
better
billie
neither
of
them
cared
a
particle
whether
smith
or
the
doctor
saw
that
billie
very
simply
and
naturally
walked
right
into
van
emmon
arms
much
better
besides
you
really
too
graceful
to
wear
anything
else
