the
abysmal
brute
i
sam
stubener
ran
through
his
mail
carelessly
and
rapidly
as
became
a
manager
of
he
was
accustomed
to
a
various
and
bizarre
correspondence
every
crank
sport
near
sport
and
reformer
seemed
to
have
ideas
to
impart
to
him
from
dire
threats
against
his
life
to
milder
threats
such
as
pushing
in
the
front
of
his
face
from
fetishes
to
lucky
from
dinky
jerkwater
bids
to
the
offers
of
irresponsible
nobodies
he
knew
the
whole
run
of
the
surprise
portion
of
his
mail
in
his
time
having
received
a
made
from
the
skin
of
a
lynched
negro
and
a
finger
withered
and
cut
from
the
body
of
a
white
man
found
in
death
valley
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
never
again
would
the
postman
bring
him
anything
that
could
startle
him
but
this
morning
he
opened
a
letter
that
he
read
a
second
time
put
away
in
his
pocket
and
took
out
for
a
third
reading
it
was
postmarked
from
some
in
siskiyou
county
and
it
ran
dear
sam
you
do
know
me
except
my
reputation
you
come
after
my
time
and
i
been
out
of
the
game
a
long
time
but
take
it
from
me
i
ai
been
asleep
i
followed
the
whole
game
and
followed
you
from
the
time
kal
aufman
knocked
you
out
to
your
last
handling
of
nat
belson
and
i
take
it
you
the
niftiest
thing
in
the
line
of
managers
that
ever
came
down
the
pike
i
got
a
proposition
for
you
i
got
the
greatest
unknown
that
ever
happened
this
ai
con
it
the
straight
goods
what
do
you
think
of
a
husky
that
tips
the
scales
at
two
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
fighting
weight
is
years
old
and
can
hit
a
kick
twice
as
hard
as
my
best
ever
that
him
my
boy
young
pat
glendon
that
the
name
he
fight
under
i
planned
it
all
out
now
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
hit
the
first
train
and
come
up
here
i
bred
him
and
i
trained
him
all
that
i
ever
had
in
my
head
hammered
into
his
and
maybe
you
wo
believe
it
but
he
added
to
it
he
a
born
fighter
he
a
wonder
at
time
and
distance
he
just
knows
to
the
second
and
the
inch
and
he
do
have
to
think
about
it
at
all
his
jolt
is
more
the
real
sleep
medicine
than
the
swing
of
most
geezers
talk
about
the
hope
of
the
white
race
this
is
him
come
and
take
a
peep
when
you
was
managing
jeffries
you
was
crazy
about
hunting
come
along
and
i
give
you
some
real
hunting
and
fishing
that
will
make
your
moving
picture
winnings
look
like
thirty
cents
i
send
young
pat
out
with
you
i
ai
able
to
get
around
that
why
i
sending
for
you
i
was
going
to
manage
him
myself
but
it
ai
no
use
i
all
in
and
likely
to
pass
out
any
time
so
get
a
move
on
i
want
you
to
manage
him
there
a
fortune
in
it
for
both
of
you
but
i
want
to
draw
up
the
contract
yours
truly
pat
glendon
stubener
was
puzzled
it
seemed
on
the
face
of
it
a
joke
the
men
in
the
fighting
game
were
notorious
jokers
and
he
tried
to
discern
the
fine
hand
of
corbett
or
the
big
friendly
paw
of
fitzsimmons
in
the
screed
before
him
but
if
it
were
genuine
he
knew
it
was
worth
looking
into
pat
glendon
was
before
his
time
though
as
a
cub
he
had
once
seen
old
pat
spar
at
the
benefit
for
jack
dempsey
even
then
he
was
called
old
pat
and
had
been
out
of
the
ring
for
years
he
had
antedated
sullivan
in
the
old
london
prize
ring
rules
though
his
last
fading
battles
had
been
put
up
under
the
incoming
marquis
of
queensbury
rules
what
did
not
know
of
pat
glendon
though
few
were
alive
who
had
seen
him
in
his
prime
and
there
were
not
many
more
who
had
seen
him
at
all
yet
his
name
had
come
down
in
the
history
of
the
ring
and
no
sporting
writer
lexicon
was
complete
without
it
his
fame
was
paradoxical
no
man
was
honored
higher
and
yet
he
had
never
attained
championship
honors
he
had
been
unfortunate
and
had
been
known
as
the
unlucky
fighter
four
times
he
all
but
won
the
heavyweight
championship
and
each
time
he
had
deserved
to
win
it
there
was
the
time
on
the
barge
in
san
francisco
bay
when
at
the
moment
he
had
the
champion
going
he
snapped
his
own
forearm
and
on
the
island
in
the
thames
sloshing
about
in
six
inches
of
rising
tide
he
broke
a
leg
at
a
similar
stage
in
a
winning
fight
in
texas
too
there
was
the
day
when
the
police
broke
in
just
as
he
had
his
man
going
in
all
certainty
and
finally
there
was
the
fight
in
the
mechanics
pavilion
in
san
francisco
when
he
was
secretly
jobbed
from
the
first
by
a
bad
man
of
a
referee
backed
by
a
small
syndicate
of
bettors
pat
glendon
had
had
no
accidents
in
that
fight
but
when
he
had
knocked
his
man
cold
with
a
right
to
the
jaw
and
a
left
to
the
solar
plexus
the
referee
calmly
disqualified
him
for
fouling
every
ringside
witness
every
sporting
expert
and
the
whole
sporting
world
knew
there
had
been
no
foul
yet
like
all
fighters
pat
glendon
had
agreed
to
abide
by
the
decision
of
the
referee
pat
abided
and
accepted
it
as
in
keeping
with
the
rest
of
his
bad
luck
this
was
pat
glendon
what
bothered
stubener
was
whether
or
not
pat
had
written
the
letter
he
carried
it
down
town
with
him
become
of
pat
glendon
such
was
his
greeting
to
all
sports
that
morning
nobody
seemed
to
know
some
thought
he
must
be
dead
but
none
knew
positively
the
fight
editor
of
a
morning
daily
looked
up
the
records
and
was
able
to
state
that
his
death
had
not
been
noted
it
was
from
tim
donovan
that
he
got
a
clue
sure
an
he
ai
dead
said
donovan
how
could
that
be
a
man
of
his
make
that
never
boozed
or
blew
himself
he
made
money
and
more
he
saved
it
and
invested
it
did
he
have
three
saloons
at
the
one
time
an
was
he
makin
slathers
of
money
with
them
when
he
sold
out
now
that
i
thinkin
that
was
the
last
time
i
laid
eyes
on
him
when
he
sold
them
out
was
all
of
twenty
years
and
more
ago
his
wife
had
just
died
i
met
him
headin
for
the
ferry
away
old
sport
says
i
me
for
the
woods
says
he
quit
tim
me
boy
and
i
never
seen
him
from
that
day
to
this
of
course
he
ai
dead
you
say
when
his
wife
died
did
he
have
any
children
stubener
queried
one
a
little
baby
he
was
luggin
it
in
his
arms
that
very
day
was
it
a
boy
how
should
i
be
knowin
it
was
then
that
sam
stubener
reached
a
decision
and
that
night
found
him
in
a
pullman
speeding
toward
the
wilds
of
northern
california
ii
stubener
was
dropped
off
the
overland
at
deer
lick
in
the
early
morning
and
he
kicked
his
heels
for
an
hour
before
the
one
saloon
opened
its
doors
no
the
saloonkeeper
did
know
anything
about
pat
glendon
had
never
heard
of
him
and
if
he
was
in
that
part
of
the
country
he
must
be
out
beyond
somewhere
neither
had
the
one
ever
heard
of
pat
glendon
at
the
hotel
the
same
ignorance
obtained
and
it
was
not
until
the
storekeeper
and
postmaster
opened
up
that
stubener
struck
the
trail
oh
yes
pat
glendon
lived
out
beyond
you
took
the
stage
at
alpine
which
was
forty
miles
and
which
was
a
logging
camp
from
alpine
on
horseback
you
rode
up
antelope
valley
and
crossed
the
divide
to
bear
creek
pat
glendon
lived
somewhere
beyond
that
the
people
of
alpine
would
know
yes
there
was
a
young
pat
the
storekeeper
had
seen
him
he
had
been
in
to
deer
lick
two
years
back
old
pat
had
not
put
in
an
appearance
for
five
years
he
bought
his
supplies
at
the
store
and
always
paid
by
check
and
he
was
a
strange
old
man
that
was
all
the
storekeeper
knew
but
the
folks
at
alpine
could
give
him
final
directions
it
looked
good
to
stubener
beyond
doubt
there
was
a
young
pat
glendon
as
well
as
an
old
one
living
out
beyond
that
night
the
manager
spent
at
the
logging
camp
of
alpine
and
early
the
following
morning
he
rode
a
mountain
cayuse
up
antelope
valley
he
rode
over
the
divide
and
down
bear
creek
he
rode
all
day
through
the
wildest
roughest
country
he
had
ever
seen
and
at
sunset
turned
up
pinto
valley
on
a
trail
so
stiff
and
narrow
that
more
than
once
he
elected
to
get
off
and
walk
it
was
eleven
when
he
dismounted
before
a
log
cabin
and
was
greeted
by
the
baying
of
two
huge
then
pat
glendon
opened
the
door
fell
on
his
neck
and
took
him
in
i
knew
ye
come
sam
me
boy
said
pat
the
while
he
limped
about
building
a
fire
boiling
coffee
and
frying
a
big
the
young
un
ai
home
the
night
we
was
gettin
short
of
meat
and
he
went
out
about
sundown
to
pick
up
a
deer
but
i
say
no
more
wait
till
ye
see
him
he
be
home
in
the
morn
and
then
you
can
try
him
out
there

gloves
but
wait
till
ye
see
him
as
for
me
i
finished
come
next
january
an
pretty
good
for
an
but
i
never
wasted
meself
sam
nor
kept
late
hours
an
burned
the
candle
at
all
ends
i
had
a
damned
good
candle
an
made
the
most
of
it
as
you
grant
at
lookin
at
me
and
i
taught
the
same
to
the
young
un
what
do
you
think
of
a
lad
of
never
had
a
drink
in
his
life
nor
tasted
tobacco

giant
and
he
lived
natural

his
days
wait

outfit
and
a
big
buck

a
child
of
the
open
air
an
winter
nor
summer
has
he
slept
under
a
roof
the
open
for
him
as
i
taught
him
the
one
thing
that
worries
me
is
how
he
take
to
sleepin
in
houses
an
how
he
stand
the
tobacco
smoke
in
the
ring
is
a
terrible
thing
that
smoke
when
you
fighting
hard
gaspin
for
air
but
no
more
sam
me
boy
you
tired
an
sure
should
be
sleepin
wait
till
you
see
him
that
all
wait
till
you
see
him
but
the
garrulousness
of
age
was
on
old
pat
and
it
was
long
before
he
permitted
stubener
eyes
to
close
he
can
run
a
deer
down
with
his
own
legs
that
young
un
he
broke
out
again
is
the
dandy
trainin
for
the
lungs
the
hunter
life
he
do
know
much
of
else
though
he
read
a
few
books
at
times
poetry
stuff
he
just
plain
pure
natural
as
you
see
when
you
clap
eyes
on
him
he
got
the
old
irish
strong
in
him
sometimes
the
way
he
moons
about
it
thinkin
strong
i
am
that
he
believes
in
the
fairies
and
he
a
nature
lover
if
ever
there
was
one
he
afeard
of
cities
he
read
about
them
but
the
biggest
he
was
ever
in
was
deer
lick
he
misliked
the
many
people
and
his
report
was
that
they
stand
weedin
out
that
was
two
years
agone
the
first
and
the
last
time
he
seen
a
locomotive
and
a
train
of
cars
sometimes
it
wrong
i
thinkin
i
am
bringin
him
up
a
natural
it
given
him
wind
and
stamina
and
the
strength
o
wild
bulls
no
man
can
have
a
against
him
i
willin
to
grant
that
jeffries
at
his
best
could
worried
the
young
un
a
bit
but
only
a
bit
the
young
un
could
broke
him
like
a
straw
he
do
look
it
that
the
everlasting
wonder
of
it
he
only
a
young
husky
but
it
the
quality
of
his
muscle
different
but
wait
till
ye
see
him
that
all
a
strange
liking
the
boy
has
for
posies
an
little
meadows
a
bit
of
pine
with
the
moon
beyond
windy
sunsets
or
the
sun
o
morns
from
the
top
of
old
baldy
an
he
has
a
hankerin
for
the
drawin
o
pitchers
of
things
an
of
spouting
about
or
night
from
the
poetry
books
he
got
from
the
school
teacher
but
is
only
his
youngness
he
settle
down
to
the
game
once
we
get
him
started
but
watch
out
for
grouches
when
it
first
comes
to
livin
in
a
city
for
him
a
good
thing
he
they
not
bother
him
for
years
he
ca
bring
himself
to
understand
the
creatures
an
damn
few
of
them
has
he
seen
at
that
was
the
school
teacher
over
at
flat
that
put
the
poetry
stuff
in
his
head
she
was
clean
daffy
over
the
young
un
an
he
never
a
girl
she
was
not
a
mountain
girl
but
from
down
in
the
an
as
time
went
by
she
was
fair
desperate
an
the
way
she
went
after
him
was
shameless
an
what
d
think
the
boy
did
when
he
tumbled
to
it
he
was
scared
as
a
jackrabbit
he
took
blankets
an
ammunition
an
hiked
for
tall
timber
not
for
a
month
did
i
lay
eyes
on
him
then
he
sneaked
in
after
dark
and
was
gone
in
the
morn
nor
would
he
as
much
as
peep
at
her
letters
he
said
an
burn
i
did
twice
she
rode
over
on
a
cayuse
all
the
way
from
samson
flat
an
i
was
sorry
for
the
young
creature
she
was
fair
hungry
for
the
boy
and
she
looked
it
in
her
face
an
at
the
end
of
three
months
she
gave
up
school
an
went
back
to
her
own
country
an
then
it
was
that
the
boy
came
home
to
the
shack
to
live
again
women
ha
ben
the
ruination
of
many
a
good
fighter
but
they
be
of
him
he
blushes
like
a
girl
if
anything
young
in
skirts
looks
at
him
a
second
time
or
too
long
the
first
one
an
they
all
look
at
him
but
when
he
fights
when
he
fights
god
it
the
old
savage
irish
that
flares
in
him
an
drives
the
fists
of
him
not
that
he
goes
off
his
base
do
walk
away
with
that
at
my
best
i
was
never
as
cool
as
he
i
misdoubt
was
the
wrath
of
me
that
brought
the
accidents
but
he
an
iceberg
he
hot
an
cold
at
the
one
time
a
live
wire
in
an
stubener
was
dozing
when
the
old
man
mumble
aroused
him
he
listened
drowsily
i
made
a
man
o
him
by
god
i
made
a
man
o
him
with
the
two
fists
of
him
an
the
upstanding
legs
of
him
an
the
eyes
and
i
know
the
game
in
my
head
an
i
kept
up
with
the
times
and
the
modern
changes
the
crouch
sure
he
knows
all
the
styles
an
economies
he
never
moves
two
inches
when
an
inch
and
a
half
will
do
the
turn
and
when
he
wants
he
can
spring
like
a
buck
kangaroo
wait
till
you
see
better
than
his
and
he
could
sure
sparred
with
peter
jackson
an
outfooted
corbett
in
his
best
i
tell
you
i
taught
it
all
to
the
last
trick
and
he
improved
on
the
teachin
he
a
fair
genius
at
the
game
he
had
plenty
of
husky
mountain
men
to
try
out
on
i
gave
him
the
fancy
work
and
they
gave
him
the
sloggin
nothing
shy
or
delicate
about
them
roarin
bulls
an
big
grizzly
bears
that
what
they
are
when
it
comes
to
huggin
in
a
clinch
or
swingin
in
the
rushes
an
he
plays
with
man
d
hear
me
he
plays
with
them
like
you
an
me
would
play
with
little
another
time
stubener
awoke
to
hear
the
old
man
mumbling
is
the
funny
think
he
do
take
fightin
seriously
it
that
easy
to
him
he
thinks
it
play
but
wait
till
he
tapped
a
swift
one
that
all
wait
an
you
see
throw
on
the
juice
in
that
cold
storage
plant
of
his
an
turn
loose
the
prettiest
scientific
wallopin
that
ever
you
laid
eyes
on
in
the
shivery
gray
of
mountain
dawn
stubener
was
routed
from
his
blankets
by
old
pat
he
comin
up
the
trail
now
was
the
hoarse
whisper
out
with
ye
an
take
your
first
peep
at
the
biggest
fightin
man
the
ring
has
ever
seen
or
will
ever
see
in
a
thousand
years
again
the
manager
peered
through
the
open
door
rubbing
the
sleep
from
his
heavy
eyes
and
saw
a
young
giant
walk
into
the
clearing
in
one
hand
was
a
rifle
across
his
shoulders
a
heavy
deer
under
which
he
moved
as
if
it
were
weightless
he
was
dressed
roughly
in
blue
overalls
and
woolen
shirt
open
at
the
throat
coat
he
had
none
and
on
his
feet
instead
of
brogans
were
moccasins
stubener
noted
that
his
walk
was
smooth
and
catlike
without
suggestion
of
his
two
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
of
weight
to
which
that
of
the
deer
was
added
the
fight
manager
was
impressed
from
the
first
glimpse
formidable
the
young
fellow
certainly
was
but
the
manager
sensed
the
strangeness
and
unusualness
of
him
he
was
a
new
type
something
different
from
the
run
of
fighters
he
seemed
a
creature
of
the
wild
more
a
figure
from
some
old
fairy
story
or
folk
tale
than
a
youth
a
thing
stubener
quickly
discovered
was
that
young
pat
was
not
much
of
a
talker
he
acknowledged
old
pat
introduction
with
a
grip
of
the
hand
but
without
speech
and
silently
set
to
work
at
building
the
fire
and
getting
breakfast
to
his
father
direct
questions
he
answered
in
monosyllables
as
for
instance
when
asked
where
he
had
picked
up
the
deer
south
fork
was
all
he
vouchsafed
eleven
miles
across
the
mountains
the
old
man
exposited
pridefully
to
stubener
an
a
trail
that
break
your
heart
breakfast
consisted
of
black
coffee
sourdough
bread
and
an
immense
quantity
of
broiled
over
the
coals
of
this
the
young
fellow
ate
ravenously
and
stubener
divined
that
both
the
glendons
were
accustomed
to
an
almost
straight
meat
diet
old
pat
did
all
the
talking
though
it
was
not
till
the
meal
was
ended
that
he
broached
the
subject
he
had
at
heart
pat
boy
he
began
you
know
who
the
gentleman
is
young
pat
nodded
and
cast
a
quick
comprehensive
glance
at
the
manager
well
he
be
takin
you
away
with
him
and
down
to
san
francisco
i
sooner
stay
here
dad
was
the
answer
stubener
felt
a
prick
of
disappointment
it
was
a
wild
goose
chase
after
all
this
was
no
fighter
eager
and
fretting
to
be
at
it
his
huge
brawn
counted
for
nothing
it
was
nothing
new
it
was
the
big
fellows
that
usually
had
the
streak
of
fat
but
old
pat
celtic
wrath
flared
up
and
his
voice
was
harsh
with
command
you
go
down
to
the
cities
an
fight
me
boy
that
what
trained
you
for
an
you
do
it
all
right
was
the
unexpected
response
rumbled
apathetically
from
the
deep
chest
and
fight
like
hell
the
old
man
added
again
stubener
felt
disappointment
at
the
absence
of
flash
and
fire
in
the
young
man
eyes
as
he
answered
all
right
when
do
we
start
oh
sam
here
he
be
wantin
a
little
huntin
and
to
fish
a
bit
as
well
as
to
try
you
out
with
the
gloves
he
looked
at
sam
who
nodded
suppose
you
strip
and
give
a
taste
of
your
quality
an
hour
later
sam
stubener
had
his
eyes
opened
an
himself
a
heavyweight
at
that
he
was
even
a
better
judge
of
fighters
and
never
had
he
seen
one
strip
to
like
advantage
see
the
softness
of
him
old
pat
chanted
is
the
true
stuff
look
at
the
slope
of
the
shoulders
an
the
lungs
of
him
clean
all
clean
to
the
last
drop
an
ounce
of
him
you
lookin
at
a
man
sam
the
like
of
which
was
never
seen
before
not
a
muscle
of
him
bound
no
or
sandow
exercise
artist
there
see
the
fat
snakes
of
muscles
soft
an
wait
till
you
see
them
flashin
like
a
strikin
rattler
he
good
for
forty
rounds
this
blessed
instant
or
a
hundred
go
to
it
time
they
went
to
it
for
rounds
with
a
minute
rests
and
sam
stubener
was
immediately
undeceived
here
was
no
streak
of
fat
no
apathy
only
a
lazy
play
of
gloves
and
tricks
with
a
brusk
stiffness
and
harsh
sharpness
in
the
contacts
that
he
knew
belonged
only
to
the
trained
and
instinctive
fighting
man
easy
now
easy
old
pat
warned
sam
not
the
man
he
used
to
be
this
nettled
sam
as
it
was
intended
to
do
and
he
played
his
most
famous
trick
and
favorite
punch
a
feint
for
a
clinch
and
a
right
rip
to
the
stomach
but
quickly
as
it
was
delivered
young
pat
saw
it
and
though
it
landed
his
body
was
going
away
the
next
time
his
body
did
not
go
away
as
the
rip
started
he
moved
forward
and
twisted
his
left
hip
to
meet
it
it
was
only
a
matter
of
several
inches
yet
it
blocked
the
blow
and
thereafter
try
as
he
would
stubener
glove
got
no
farther
than
that
hip
stubener
had
roughed
it
with
big
men
in
his
time
and
in
exhibition
bouts
had
creditably
held
his
own
but
there
was
no
holding
his
own
here
young
pat
played
with
him
and
in
the
clinches
made
him
feel
as
powerful
as
a
baby
landing
on
him
seemingly
at
will
locking
and
blocking
with
masterful
accuracy
and
scarcely
noticing
or
acknowledging
his
existence
half
the
time
young
pat
seemed
to
spend
in
gazing
off
and
out
at
the
landscape
in
a
dreamy
sort
of
way
and
right
here
stubener
made
another
mistake
he
took
it
for
a
trick
of
old
pat
training
tried
to
sneak
in
a
jolt
found
his
arm
in
a
lightning
lock
and
had
both
his
ears
cuffed
for
his
pains
the
instinct
for
a
blow
the
old
man
chortled
is
not
put
on
i
tellin
you
he
is
a
wiz
he
knows
a
blow
without
the
lookin
when
it
starts
an
where
the
speed
an
space
an
niceness
of
it
nothing
i
ever
showed
him
is
inspiration
he
was
so
born
once
in
a
clinch
the
fight
manager
heeled
his
glove
on
young
mouth
and
there
was
just
a
hint
of
viciousness
in
the
manner
of
doing
it
a
moment
later
in
the
next
clinch
sam
received
the
heel
of
the
other
glove
on
his
own
mouth
there
was
nothing
snappy
about
it
but
the
pressure
stolidly
lazy
as
it
was
put
his
head
back
till
the
joints
cracked
and
for
the
moment
he
thought
his
neck
was
broken
he
slacked
his
body
and
dropped
his
arms
in
token
that
the
bout
was
over
felt
the
instant
release
and
staggered
clear
he
he
do
he
gasped
looking
the
admiration
he
lacked
the
breath
to
utter
old
pat
eyes
were
brightly
moist
with
pride
and
triumph
an
what
will
you
be
thinkin
to
happen
when
some
of
the
gay
ugly
ones
tries
to
rough
it
on
him
he
asked
he
kill
them
sure
was
stubener
verdict
no
he
too
cool
for
that
but
he
just
hurt
them
some
for
their
dirtiness
let
draw
up
the
contract
said
the
manager
wait
till
you
know
the
whole
worth
of
him
old
pat
answered
is
strong
terms
i
be
makin
you
come
to
go
for
a
with
the
boy
over
the
hills
an
learn
the
lungs
and
the
legs
of
him
then
we
sign
up
and
regular
stubener
was
gone
two
days
on
that
hunt
and
he
learned
all
and
more
than
old
pat
had
promised
and
came
back
a
very
weary
and
very
humble
man
the
young
fellow
innocence
of
the
world
had
been
startling
to
the
manager
but
he
had
found
him
nobody
fool
virgin
though
his
mind
was
untouched
by
all
save
a
narrow
mountain
experience
nevertheless
he
had
proved
possession
of
a
natural
keenness
and
shrewdness
far
beyond
the
average
in
a
way
he
was
a
mystery
to
sam
who
could
not
understand
his
terrible
equanimity
of
temper
nothing
ruffled
him
or
worried
him
and
his
patience
was
of
an
enduring
primitiveness
he
never
swore
not
even
the
futile
and
emasculated
of
i
swear
all
right
if
i
wanted
to
he
had
explained
when
challenged
by
his
companion
but
i
guess
i
never
come
to
needing
it
when
i
do
i
swear
i
suppose
old
pat
resolutely
adhering
to
his
decision
said
at
the
cabin
it
wo
be
long
pat
boy
when
i
be
readin
about
you
in
the
papers
i
like
to
go
along
but
i
afeard
it
me
for
the
mountains
till
the
end
and
then
drawing
the
manager
aside
the
old
man
turned
loose
on
him
almost
savagely
remember
what
i
ben
tellin
ye
over
an
over
the
boy
clean
he
honest
he
knows
nothing
of
the
rottenness
of
the
game
i
kept
it
all
away
from
him
i
tell
you
he
do
know
the
meanin
of
fake
he
knows
only
the
bravery
an
romance
an
glory
of
fightin
and
filled
him
up
with
tales
of
the
old
ring
heroes
though
little
enough
god
knows
it
set
him
afire
man
man
i
tellin
you
that
i
clipped
the
fight
columns
from
the
newspapers
to
keep
it
from
him
him
i
was
wantin
them
for
me
scrap
book
he
do
know
a
man
ever
lay
down
or
threw
a
fight
so
do
you
get
him
in
anything
that
ai
straight
do
turn
the
boy
stomach
that
why
i
put
in
the
null
and
void
clause
the
first
rottenness
and
the
contract
broke
of
itself
no
snide
division
of
no
secret
arrangements
with
the
movin
pitcher
men
for
guaranteed
distance
there
slathers
money
for
the
both
of
you
but
play
it
square
or
you
lose
understand
and
whatever
you
be
doin
watch
out
for
the
women
was
old
parting
admonishment
young
pat
astride
his
horse
and
reining
in
dutifully
to
hear
women
is
death
an
damnation
remember
that
but
when
you
do
find
the
one
the
only
one
hang
on
to
her
she
be
worth
more
than
glory
an
money
but
first
be
sure
an
when
sure
do
let
her
slip
through
your
fingers
grab
her
with
the
two
hands
of
you
and
hang
on
hang
on
if
all
the
world
goes
to
smash
smithereens
pat
boy
a
good
woman
is
a
good
woman
is
the
first
word
and
the
last
iii
once
in
san
francisco
sam
stubener
troubles
began
not
that
young
pat
had
a
nasty
temper
or
was
grouchy
as
his
father
had
feared
on
the
contrary
he
was
phenomenally
sweet
and
mild
but
he
was
homesick
for
his
beloved
mountains
also
he
was
secretly
appalled
by
the
city
though
he
trod
its
roaring
streets
imperturbable
as
a
red
indian
i
came
down
here
to
fight
he
announced
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
where
jim
hanford
stubener
whistled
a
big
champion
like
him
would
look
at
you
was
his
answer
and
get
a
reputation
is
what
he
say
i
can
lick
him
but
the
public
does
know
that
if
you
licked
him
you
be
champion
of
the
world
and
no
champion
ever
became
so
with
his
first
fight
i
can
but
the
public
does
know
it
pat
it
would
come
to
see
you
fight
and
it
the
crowd
that
brings
the
money
and
the
big
purses
that
why
jim
hanford
would
consider
you
for
a
second
there
be
nothing
in
it
for
him
besides
he
getting
three
thousand
a
week
right
now
in
vaudeville
with
a
contract
for
weeks
do
you
think
he
chuck
that
for
a
go
with
a
man
no
one
ever
heard
of
you
got
to
do
something
first
make
a
record
you
got
to
begin
on
the
little
local
dubs
that
nobody
ever
heard
of
guys
like
chub
collins
kelly
and
the
flying
dutchman
when
you
put
them
away
you
only
started
on
the
first
round
of
the
ladder
but
after
that
you
go
up
like
a
balloon
i
meet
those
three
named
in
the
same
ring
one
after
the
other
was
pat
decision
make
the
arrangements
accordingly
stubener
laughed
what
wrong
do
you
think
i
can
put
them
away
i
know
you
can
stubener
assured
him
but
it
ca
be
arranged
that
way
you
got
to
take
them
one
at
a
time
besides
remember
i
know
the
game
and
i
managing
you
this
proposition
has
to
be
worked
up
and
i
the
boy
that
knows
how
if
we
lucky
you
may
get
to
the
top
in
a
couple
of
years
and
be
the
champion
with
a
mint
of
money
pat
sighed
at
the
prospect
then
brightened
up
and
after
that
i
can
retire
and
go
back
home
to
the
old
man
he
said
stubener
was
about
to
reply
but
checked
himself
strange
as
was
this
championship
material
he
felt
confident
that
when
the
top
was
reached
it
would
prove
very
similar
to
that
of
all
the
others
who
had
gone
before
besides
two
years
was
a
long
way
off
and
there
was
much
to
be
done
in
the
meantime
when
pat
fell
to
moping
around
his
quarters
reading
endless
poetry
books
and
novels
drawn
from
the
public
library
stubener
sent
him
off
to
live
on
a
contra
costa
ranch
across
the
bay
under
the
watchful
eye
of
spider
walsh
at
the
end
of
a
week
spider
whispered
that
the
job
was
a
cinch
his
charge
was
away
and
over
the
hills
from
dawn
till
dark
whipping
the
streams
for
trout
shooting
quail
and
rabbits
and
pursuing
the
one
lone
and
crafty
buck
famous
for
having
survived
a
decade
of
hunters
it
was
the
spider
who
waxed
lazy
and
fat
while
his
charge
kept
himself
in
condition
as
stubener
expected
his
unknown
was
laughed
at
by
the
fight
club
managers
were
not
the
woods
full
of
unknowns
who
were
always
breaking
out
with
championship
rashes
a
preliminary
say
of
four
rounds
yes
they
would
grant
him
that
but
the
main
event
never
stubener
was
resolved
that
young
pat
should
make
his
debut
in
nothing
less
than
a
main
event
and
by
the
prestige
of
his
own
name
he
at
last
managed
it
with
much
misgiving
the
mission
club
agreed
that
pat
glendon
could
go
fifteen
rounds
with
kelly
for
a
purse
of
one
hundred
dollars
it
was
the
custom
of
young
fighters
to
assume
the
names
of
old
ring
heroes
so
no
one
suspected
that
he
was
the
son
of
the
great
pat
glendon
while
stubener
held
his
peace
it
was
a
good
press
surprise
package
to
spring
later
came
the
night
of
the
fight
after
a
month
of
waiting
anxiety
was
keen
his
professional
reputation
was
staked
that
his
man
would
make
a
showing
and
he
was
astounded
to
see
pat
seated
in
his
corner
a
bare
five
minutes
lose
the
healthy
color
from
his
cheeks
which
turned
a
sickly
yellow
cheer
up
boy
stubener
said
slapping
him
on
the
shoulder
the
first
time
in
the
ring
is
always
strange
and
kelly
has
a
way
of
letting
his
opponent
wait
for
him
on
the
chance
of
getting
it
is
that
pat
answered
it
the
tobacco
smoke
i
not
used
to
it
and
it
making
me
fair
sick
his
manager
experienced
the
quick
shock
of
relief
a
man
who
turned
sick
from
mental
causes
even
if
he
were
a
samson
could
never
win
to
place
in
the
prize
ring
as
for
tobacco
smoke
the
youngster
would
have
to
get
used
to
it
that
was
all
young
pat
entrance
into
the
ring
had
been
met
with
silence
but
when
kelly
crawled
through
the
ropes
his
greeting
was
uproarious
he
did
not
belie
his
name
he
was
a
man
black
and
hairy
with
huge
knotty
muscles
weighing
a
full
two
hundred
pounds
pat
looked
across
at
him
curiously
and
received
a
savage
scowl
after
both
had
been
introduced
to
the
audience
they
shook
hands
and
even
as
their
gloves
gripped
kelly
ground
his
teeth
convulsed
his
face
with
an
expression
of
rage
and
muttered
you
got
yer
nerve
wid
yeh
he
flung
pat
hand
roughly
from
his
and
hissed
i
eat
yeh
up
ye
pup
the
audience
laughed
at
the
action
and
it
guessed
hilariously
at
what
kelly
must
have
said
back
in
his
corner
and
waiting
the
gong
pat
turned
to
stubener
why
is
he
angry
with
me
he
asked
he
ai
stubener
answered
that
his
way
trying
to
scare
you
it
just
it
is
boxing
was
pat
comment
and
stubener
with
a
quick
glance
noted
that
his
eyes
were
as
mildly
blue
as
ever
be
careful
the
manager
warned
as
the
gong
for
the
first
round
sounded
and
pat
stood
up
he
liable
to
come
at
you
like
a
and
like
a
kelly
did
come
at
him
rushing
across
the
ring
in
wild
fury
pat
who
in
his
easy
way
had
advanced
only
a
couple
of
paces
gauged
the
other
momentum
and
brought
his
right
across
to
the
jaw
then
he
stood
and
looked
on
with
a
great
curiosity
the
fight
was
over
kelly
had
fallen
like
a
stricken
bullock
to
the
floor
and
there
he
lay
without
movement
while
the
referee
bending
over
him
shouted
the
ten
seconds
in
his
unheeding
ear
when
kelly
seconds
came
to
lift
him
pat
was
before
them
gathering
the
huge
inert
bulk
of
the
man
in
his
arms
he
carried
him
to
his
corner
and
deposited
him
on
the
stool
and
in
the
arms
of
his
seconds
half
a
minute
later
kelly
head
lifted
and
his
eyes
wavered
open
he
looked
about
him
stupidly
and
then
to
one
of
his
seconds
what
happened
he
queried
hoarsely
did
the
roof
fall
on
me
iv
as
a
result
of
his
fight
with
kelly
though
the
general
opinion
was
that
he
had
won
by
a
fluke
pat
was
matched
with
rufe
mason
this
took
place
three
weeks
later
and
the
sierra
club
audience
at
dreamland
rink
failed
to
see
what
happened
rufe
mason
was
a
heavyweight
noted
locally
for
his
cleverness
when
the
gong
for
the
first
round
sounded
both
men
met
in
the
center
of
the
ring
neither
rushed
nor
did
they
strike
a
blow
they
felt
around
each
other
their
arms
bent
their
gloves
so
close
together
that
they
almost
touched
this
lasted
for
perhaps
five
seconds
then
it
happened
and
so
quickly
that
not
one
in
a
hundred
of
the
audience
saw
rufe
mason
made
a
feint
with
his
right
it
was
obviously
not
a
real
feint
but
a
feeler
a
mere
tentative
threatening
of
a
possible
blow
it
was
at
this
instant
that
pat
loosed
his
punch
so
close
together
were
they
that
the
distance
the
blow
traveled
was
a
scant
eight
inches
it
was
a
left
jolt
and
it
was
accomplished
by
a
twist
of
the
left
forearm
and
a
thrust
of
the
shoulder
it
landed
flush
on
the
point
of
the
chin
and
the
astounded
audience
saw
rufe
mason
legs
crumple
under
him
as
his
body
sank
to
the
floor
but
the
referee
had
seen
and
he
promptly
proceeded
to
count
him
out
again
pat
carried
his
opponent
to
his
corner
and
it
was
ten
minutes
before
rufe
mason
supported
by
his
seconds
with
sagging
knees
and
rolling
glassy
eyes
was
able
to
move
down
the
aisle
through
the
stupefied
and
incredulous
audience
on
the
way
to
his
dressing
room
no
wonder
he
told
a
reporter
that
kelly
thought
the
roof
hit
him
after
chub
collins
had
been
put
out
in
the
twelfth
second
of
the
first
round
of
a
contest
stubener
felt
compelled
to
speak
to
pat
do
you
know
what
they
calling
you
now
he
asked
pat
shook
his
head
one
punch
glendon
pat
smiled
politely
he
was
little
interested
in
what
he
was
called
he
had
certain
work
cut
out
which
he
must
do
ere
he
could
win
back
to
his
mountains
and
he
was
phlegmatically
doing
it
that
was
all
it
wo
do
his
manager
continued
with
an
ominous
shake
of
the
head
you
ca
go
on
putting
your
men
out
so
quickly
you
must
give
them
more
time
i
here
to
fight
ai
i
pat
demanded
in
surprise
again
stubener
shook
his
head
it
this
way
pat
you
got
to
be
big
and
generous
in
the
fighting
game
do
get
all
the
other
fighters
sore
and
it
not
fair
to
the
audience
they
want
a
run
for
their
money
besides
no
one
will
fight
you
they
all
be
scared
out
and
you
ca
draw
crowds
with
fights
i
leave
it
to
you
would
you
pay
a
dollar
or
five
to
see
a
fight
pat
was
convinced
and
he
promised
to
give
future
audiences
the
requisite
run
for
their
money
though
he
stated
that
personally
he
preferred
going
fishing
to
witnessing
a
hundred
rounds
of
fighting
and
still
pat
had
got
practically
nowhere
in
the
game
the
local
sports
laughed
when
his
name
was
mentioned
it
called
to
mind
funny
fights
and
kelly
remark
about
the
roof
nobody
knew
how
pat
could
fight
they
had
never
seen
him
where
was
his
wind
his
stamina
his
ability
to
mix
it
with
rough
customers
through
long
grueling
contests
he
had
demonstrated
nothing
but
the
possession
of
a
lucky
punch
and
a
depressing
proclivity
for
flukes
so
it
was
that
his
fourth
match
was
arranged
with
pete
sosso
a
portuguese
fighter
from
butchertown
known
only
for
the
amazing
tricks
he
played
in
the
ring
pat
did
not
train
for
the
fight
instead
he
made
a
flying
and
sorrowful
trip
to
the
mountains
to
bury
his
father
old
pat
had
known
well
the
condition
of
his
heart
and
it
had
stopped
suddenly
on
him
young
pat
arrived
back
in
san
francisco
with
so
close
a
margin
of
time
that
he
changed
into
his
fighting
togs
directly
from
his
traveling
suit
and
even
then
the
audience
was
kept
waiting
ten
minutes
remember
give
him
a
chance
stubener
cautioned
him
as
he
climbed
through
the
ropes
play
with
him
but
do
it
seriously
let
him
go
ten
or
twelve
rounds
then
get
him
pat
obeyed
instructions
and
though
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
to
put
sosso
out
so
tricky
was
he
that
to
stand
up
to
him
and
not
put
him
out
kept
his
hands
full
it
was
a
pretty
exhibition
and
the
audience
was
delighted
sosso
whirlwind
attacks
wild
feints
retreats
and
rushes
required
all
pat
science
to
protect
himself
and
even
then
he
did
not
escape
unscathed
stubener
praised
him
in
the
and
all
would
have
been
well
had
not
sosso
in
the
fourth
round
played
one
of
his
most
spectacular
tricks
pat
in
a
had
landed
a
hook
to
sosso
jaw
when
to
his
amazement
the
latter
dropped
his
hands
and
reeled
backward
eyes
rolling
legs
bending
and
giving
in
a
high
state
of
grogginess
pat
could
not
understand
it
had
not
been
a
blow
and
yet
there
was
his
man
all
ready
to
fall
to
the
mat
pat
dropped
his
own
hands
and
wonderingly
watched
his
reeling
opponent
sosso
staggered
away
almost
fell
recovered
and
staggered
obliquely
and
blindly
forward
again
for
the
first
and
the
last
time
in
his
fighting
career
pat
was
caught
off
his
guard
he
actually
stepped
aside
to
let
the
reeling
man
go
by
still
reeling
sosso
suddenly
loosed
his
right
pat
received
it
full
on
his
jaw
with
an
impact
that
rattled
all
his
teeth
a
great
roar
of
delight
went
up
from
the
audience
but
pat
did
not
hear
he
saw
only
sosso
before
him
grinning
and
defiant
and
not
the
least
bit
groggy
pat
was
hurt
by
the
blow
but
vastly
more
outraged
by
the
trick
all
the
wrath
that
his
father
ever
had
surged
up
in
him
he
shook
his
head
as
if
to
get
rid
of
the
shock
of
the
blow
and
steadied
himself
before
his
man
it
all
occurred
in
the
next
second
with
a
feint
that
drew
his
opponent
pat
fetched
his
left
to
the
solar
plexus
almost
at
the
same
instant
whipping
his
right
across
to
the
jaw
the
latter
blow
landed
on
sosso
mouth
ere
his
falling
body
struck
the
floor
the
club
doctors
worked
half
an
hour
to
bring
him
to
after
that
they
put
eleven
stitches
in
his
mouth
and
packed
him
off
in
an
ambulance
i
sorry
pat
told
his
manager
i
afraid
i
lost
my
temper
never
do
it
again
in
the
ring
dad
always
cautioned
me
about
it
he
said
it
had
made
him
lose
more
than
one
battle
i
did
know
i
could
lose
my
temper
that
way
but
now
that
i
know
i
keep
it
in
control
and
stubener
believed
him
he
was
coming
to
the
stage
where
he
could
believe
anything
about
his
young
charge
you
do
need
to
get
angry
he
said
you
so
thoroughly
the
master
of
your
man
at
any
stage
at
any
inch
or
second
of
the
fight
pat
affirmed
and
you
can
put
them
out
any
time
you
want
sure
i
can
i
do
want
to
boast
but
i
just
seem
to
possess
the
ability
my
eyes
show
me
the
opening
that
my
skill
knows
how
to
make
and
time
and
distance
are
second
nature
to
me
dad
called
it
a
gift
but
i
thought
he
was
blarneying
me
now
that
i
been
up
against
these
men
i
guess
he
was
right
he
said
i
had
the
mind
and
muscle
correlation
at
any
inch
or
second
of
the
fight
stubener
repeated
musingly
pat
nodded
and
stubener
absolutely
believing
him
caught
a
vision
of
a
golden
future
that
should
have
fetched
old
pat
out
of
his
grave
well
do
forget
we
got
to
give
the
crowd
a
run
for
its
money
he
said
we
fix
it
up
between
us
how
many
rounds
a
fight
should
go
now
your
next
bout
will
be
with
the
flying
dutchman
suppose
you
let
it
run
the
full
fifteen
and
put
him
out
in
the
last
round
that
will
give
you
a
chance
to
make
a
showing
as
well
all
right
sam
was
the
answer
it
will
be
a
test
for
you
stubener
warned
you
may
fail
to
put
him
out
in
that
last
round
watch
me
pat
paused
to
put
weight
to
his
promise
and
picked
up
a
volume
of
longfellow
if
i
do
i
never
read
poetry
again
and
that
going
some
you
bet
it
is
his
manager
proclaimed
jubilantly
though
what
you
see
in
such
stuff
is
beyond
me
pat
sighed
but
did
not
reply
in
all
his
life
he
had
found
but
one
person
who
cared
for
poetry
and
that
had
been
the
school
teacher
who
scared
him
off
into
the
woods
v
where
are
you
going
stubener
demanded
in
surprise
looking
at
his
watch
pat
with
his
hand
on
the
paused
and
turned
around
to
the
academy
of
sciences
he
said
there
a
professor
going
to
give
a
lecture
there
on
browning
and
browning
is
the
sort
of
writer
you
need
assistance
with
sometimes
i
think
i
ought
to
go
to
night
school
but
great
scott
man
exclaimed
the
horrified
manager
you
on
with
the
flying
dutchman
i
know
it
but
i
wo
enter
the
ring
a
moment
before
half
past
nine
or
quarter
to
ten
the
lecture
will
be
over
at
nine
fifteen
if
you
want
to
make
sure
come
around
and
pick
me
up
in
your
machine
stubener
shrugged
his
shoulders
helplessly
you
got
no
kick
coming
pat
assured
him
dad
used
to
tell
me
a
man
worst
time
was
in
the
hours
just
before
a
fight
and
that
many
a
fight
was
lost
by
a
man
breaking
down
right
there
with
nothing
to
do
but
think
and
be
anxious
well
you
never
need
to
worry
about
me
that
way
you
ought
to
be
glad
i
can
go
off
to
a
lecture
and
later
that
night
in
the
course
of
watching
fifteen
splendid
rounds
stubener
chuckled
to
himself
more
than
once
at
the
idea
of
what
that
audience
of
sports
would
think
did
it
know
that
this
magnificent
young
had
come
to
the
ring
directly
from
a
browning
lecture
the
flying
dutchman
was
a
young
swede
who
possessed
an
unwonted
willingness
to
fight
and
who
was
blessed
with
phenomenal
endurance
he
never
rested
was
always
on
the
offensive
and
rushed
and
fought
from
gong
to
gong
in
the
his
arms
whirled
about
like
flails
in
the
he
was
forever
shouldering
or
and
starting
blows
whenever
he
could
get
a
hand
free
from
start
to
finish
he
was
a
whirlwind
hence
his
name
his
failing
was
lack
of
judgment
in
time
and
distance
nevertheless
he
had
won
many
fights
by
virtue
of
landing
one
in
each
dozen
or
so
of
the
unending
fusillades
of
punches
he
delivered
pat
with
strong
upon
him
the
caution
that
he
must
not
put
his
opponent
out
was
kept
busy
nor
though
he
escaped
vital
damage
could
he
avoid
entirely
those
eternal
flying
gloves
but
it
was
good
training
and
in
a
mild
way
he
enjoyed
the
contest
could
you
get
him
now
stubener
whispered
in
his
ear
during
the
minute
rest
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
round
sure
was
pat
answer
you
know
he
never
yet
been
knocked
out
by
any
one
stubener
warned
a
couple
of
rounds
later
then
i
afraid
i
have
to
break
my
knuckles
pat
smiled
i
know
the
punch
i
got
in
me
and
when
i
land
it
something
got
to
go
if
he
wo
my
knuckles
will
do
you
think
you
could
get
him
now
stubener
asked
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
round
anytime
i
tell
you
well
then
pat
let
him
run
to
the
fifteenth
in
the
fourteenth
round
the
flying
dutchman
exceeded
himself
at
the
stroke
of
the
gong
he
rushed
clear
across
the
ring
to
the
opposite
corner
where
pat
was
leisurely
getting
to
his
feet
the
house
cheered
for
it
knew
the
flying
dutchman
had
cut
loose
pat
catching
the
fun
of
it
whimsically
decided
to
meet
the
terrific
onslaught
with
a
wholly
passive
defense
and
not
to
strike
a
blow
nor
did
he
strike
a
blow
nor
feint
a
blow
during
the
three
minutes
of
whirlwind
that
followed
he
gave
a
rare
exhibition
of
stalling
sometimes
hugging
his
bowed
face
with
his
left
arm
his
abdomen
with
his
right
at
other
times
changing
as
the
point
of
attack
changed
so
that
both
gloves
were
held
on
either
side
his
face
or
both
elbows
and
forearms
guarded
his
and
all
the
time
moving
about
clumsily
shouldering
or
forward
against
his
opponent
and
clogging
his
efforts
himself
never
striking
nor
threatening
to
strike
the
while
rocking
with
the
impacts
of
the
storming
blows
that
beat
upon
his
various
guards
the
devil
own
tattoo
those
close
at
the
ringside
saw
and
appreciated
but
the
rest
of
the
audience
fooled
arose
to
its
feet
and
roared
its
applause
in
the
mistaken
notion
that
pat
helpless
was
receiving
a
terrible
beating
with
the
end
of
the
round
the
audience
dumbfounded
sank
back
into
its
seats
as
pat
walked
steadily
to
his
corner
it
was
not
understandable
he
should
have
been
beaten
to
a
pulp
and
yet
nothing
had
happened
to
him
now
are
you
going
to
get
him
stubener
queried
anxiously
inside
ten
seconds
was
pat
confident
assertion
watch
me
there
was
no
trick
about
it
when
the
gong
struck
and
pat
bounded
to
his
feet
he
advertised
it
unmistakably
that
for
the
first
time
in
the
fight
he
was
starting
after
his
man
not
one
onlooker
misunderstood
the
flying
dutchman
read
the
advertisement
too
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
career
as
they
met
in
the
center
of
the
ring
visibly
hesitated
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
they
faced
each
other
in
position
then
the
flying
dutchman
leaped
forward
upon
his
man
and
pat
with
a
timed
dropped
him
cold
as
he
leaped
it
was
after
this
battle
that
pat
glendon
started
on
his
upward
rush
to
fame
the
sports
and
the
sporting
writers
took
him
up
for
the
first
time
the
flying
dutchman
had
been
knocked
out
his
conqueror
had
proved
a
wizard
of
defense
his
previous
victories
had
not
been
flukes
he
had
a
kick
in
both
his
hands
giant
that
he
was
he
would
go
far
the
time
was
already
past
the
writers
asserted
for
him
to
waste
himself
on
the
and
chopping
blocks
where
were
ben
menzies
rege
rede
bill
tarwater
and
ernest
lawson
it
was
time
for
them
to
meet
this
young
cub
that
had
suddenly
shown
himself
a
fighter
of
quality
where
was
his
manager
anyway
that
he
was
not
issuing
the
challenges
and
then
fame
came
in
a
day
for
stubener
divulged
the
secret
that
his
man
was
none
other
than
the
son
of
pat
glendon
old
pat
the
ring
hero
young
pat
glendon
he
was
promptly
christened
and
sports
and
writers
flocked
about
him
to
admire
him
and
back
him
and
write
him
up
beginning
with
ben
menzies
and
finishing
with
bill
tarwater
he
challenged
fought
and
knocked
out
the
four
to
do
this
he
was
compelled
to
travel
the
battles
taking
place
in
goldfield
denver
texas
and
new
york
to
accomplish
it
required
months
for
the
bigger
fights
were
not
easily
arranged
and
the
men
themselves
demanded
more
time
for
training
the
second
year
saw
him
running
to
cover
and
disposing
of
the
big
fighters
that
clustered
just
beneath
the
top
of
the
heavyweight
ladder
on
this
top
firmly
planted
stood
big
jim
hanford
the
undefeated
world
champion
here
on
the
top
rungs
progress
was
slower
though
stubener
was
indefatigable
in
issuing
challenges
and
in
promoting
sporting
opinion
to
force
the
man
to
fight
will
king
was
disposed
of
in
england
and
glendon
pursued
tom
harrison
half
way
around
the
world
to
defeat
him
on
boxing
day
in
australia
but
the
purses
grew
larger
and
larger
in
place
of
a
hundred
dollars
such
as
his
first
battles
had
earned
him
he
was
now
receiving
from
twenty
to
thirty
thousand
dollars
a
fight
as
well
as
equally
large
sums
from
the
moving
picture
men
stubener
took
his
percentage
of
all
this
according
to
the
terms
of
the
contract
old
pat
had
drawn
up
and
both
he
and
glendon
despite
their
heavy
expenses
were
waxing
rich
this
was
due
more
than
anything
else
to
the
clean
lives
they
lived
they
were
not
wasters
stubener
was
attracted
to
real
estate
and
his
holdings
in
san
francisco
consisting
of
building
flats
and
apartment
houses
were
bigger
than
glendon
ever
dreamed
there
was
a
secret
syndicate
of
bettors
however
which
could
have
made
an
accurate
guess
at
the
size
of
stubener
holdings
while
heavy
bonus
after
heavy
bonus
of
which
glendon
never
heard
was
paid
over
to
his
manager
by
the
moving
picture
men
stubener
most
serious
task
was
in
maintaining
the
innocence
of
his
young
gladiator
nor
did
he
find
it
difficult
glendon
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
end
was
little
interested
besides
wherever
his
travels
took
him
he
spent
his
spare
time
in
hunting
and
fishing
he
rarely
mingled
with
those
of
the
sporting
world
was
notoriously
shy
and
secluded
and
preferred
art
galleries
and
books
of
verse
to
sporting
gossip
also
his
trainers
and
sparring
partners
were
rigorously
instructed
by
the
manager
to
keep
their
tongues
away
from
the
slightest
hints
of
ring
rottenness
in
every
way
stubener
intervened
between
glendon
and
the
world
he
was
never
even
interviewed
save
in
stubener
presence
only
once
was
glendon
approached
it
was
just
prior
to
his
battle
with
henderson
and
an
offer
of
a
hundred
thousand
was
made
to
him
to
throw
the
fight
it
was
made
hurriedly
in
swift
whispers
in
a
hotel
corridor
and
it
was
fortunate
for
the
man
that
pat
controlled
his
temper
and
shouldered
past
him
without
reply
he
brought
the
tale
of
it
to
stubener
who
said
it
only
con
pat
they
were
trying
to
josh
you
he
noted
the
blue
eyes
blaze
and
maybe
worse
than
that
if
they
could
have
got
you
to
fall
for
it
there
might
have
been
a
big
sensation
in
the
papers
that
would
have
finished
you
but
i
doubt
it
such
things
do
happen
any
more
it
a
myth
that
what
it
is
that
has
come
down
from
the
middle
history
of
the
ring
there
has
been
rottenness
in
the
past
but
no
fighter
or
manager
of
reputation
would
dare
anything
of
the
sort
why
pat
the
men
in
the
game
are
as
clean
and
straight
as
those
in
professional
baseball
than
which
there
is
nothing
cleaner
or
straighter
and
all
the
while
he
talked
stubener
knew
in
his
heart
that
the
forthcoming
fight
with
henderson
was
not
to
be
shorter
than
twelve
rounds
this
for
the
moving
pictures
and
not
longer
than
the
fourteenth
round
and
he
knew
furthermore
so
big
were
the
stakes
involved
that
henderson
himself
was
pledged
not
to
last
beyond
the
fourteenth
and
glendon
never
approached
again
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
and
went
out
to
spend
the
afternoon
in
taking
color
photographs
the
camera
had
become
his
latest
hobby
loving
pictures
yet
unable
to
paint
he
had
compromised
by
taking
up
photography
in
his
hand
baggage
was
one
grip
packed
with
books
on
the
subject
and
he
spent
long
hours
in
the
dark
room
realizing
for
himself
the
various
processes
never
had
there
been
a
great
fighter
who
was
as
aloof
from
the
fighting
world
as
he
because
he
had
little
to
say
with
those
he
encountered
he
was
called
sullen
and
unsocial
and
out
of
this
a
newspaper
reputation
took
form
that
was
not
an
exaggeration
so
much
as
it
was
an
entire
misconception
boiled
down
his
character
in
print
was
that
of
an
and
dumbly
stupid
brute
and
one
callow
sporting
writer
dubbed
him
the
abysmal
brute
the
name
stuck
the
rest
of
the
fraternity
hailed
it
with
delight
and
thereafter
glendon
name
never
appeared
in
print
unconnected
with
it
often
in
a
headline
or
under
a
photograph
the
abysmal
brute
capitalized
and
without
quotation
marks
appeared
alone
all
the
world
knew
who
was
this
brute
this
made
him
draw
into
himself
closer
than
ever
while
it
developed
a
bitter
prejudice
against
newspaper
folk
regarding
fighting
itself
his
earlier
mild
interest
grew
stronger
the
men
he
now
fought
were
anything
but
dubs
and
victory
did
not
come
so
easily
they
were
picked
men
experienced
ring
generals
and
each
battle
was
a
problem
there
were
occasions
when
he
found
it
impossible
to
put
them
out
in
any
designated
later
round
of
a
fight
thus
with
sulzberger
the
gigantic
german
try
as
he
would
in
the
eighteenth
round
he
failed
to
get
him
in
the
nineteenth
it
was
the
same
story
and
not
till
the
twentieth
did
he
manage
to
break
through
the
baffling
guard
and
drop
him
glendon
increasing
enjoyment
of
the
game
was
accompanied
by
severer
and
prolonged
training
never
dissipating
spending
much
of
his
time
on
hunting
trips
in
the
hills
he
was
practically
always
in
the
pink
of
condition
and
unlike
his
father
no
unfortunate
accidents
marred
his
career
he
never
broke
a
bone
nor
injured
so
much
as
a
knuckle
one
thing
that
stubener
noted
with
secret
glee
was
that
his
young
fighter
no
longer
talked
of
going
permanently
back
to
his
mountains
when
he
had
won
the
championship
away
from
jim
hanford
vi
the
consummation
of
his
career
was
rapidly
approaching
the
great
champion
had
even
publicly
intimated
his
readiness
to
take
on
glendon
as
soon
as
the
latter
had
disposed
of
the
three
or
four
aspirants
for
the
championship
who
intervened
in
six
months
pat
managed
to
put
away
kid
mcgrath
and
philadelphia
jack
mcbride
and
there
remained
only
nat
powers
and
tom
cannam
and
all
would
have
been
well
had
not
a
certain
society
girl
gone
adventuring
into
journalism
and
had
not
stubener
agreed
to
an
interview
with
the
woman
reporter
of
the
san
francisco
her
work
was
always
published
over
the
name
of
maud
sangster
which
by
the
way
was
her
own
name
the
sangsters
were
a
notoriously
wealthy
family
the
founder
old
jacob
sangster
had
packed
his
blankets
and
worked
as
a
in
the
west
he
had
discovered
an
inexhaustible
borax
deposit
in
nevada
and
from
hauling
it
out
by
had
built
a
railroad
to
do
the
freighting
following
that
he
had
poured
the
profits
of
borax
into
the
purchase
of
hundreds
and
thousands
of
square
miles
of
timber
lands
in
california
oregon
and
washington
still
later
he
had
combined
politics
with
business
bought
statesmen
judges
and
machines
and
become
a
captain
of
complicated
industry
and
after
that
he
had
died
full
of
honor
and
pessimism
leaving
his
name
a
muddy
blot
for
future
historians
to
smudge
and
also
leaving
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
hundreds
of
millions
for
his
four
sons
to
squabble
over
the
legal
industrial
and
political
battles
that
followed
vexed
and
amused
california
for
a
generation
and
culminated
in
deadly
hatred
and
unspeaking
terms
between
the
four
sons
the
youngest
theodore
in
middle
life
experienced
a
change
of
heart
sold
out
his
stock
farms
and
racing
stables
and
plunged
into
a
fight
with
all
the
corrupt
powers
of
his
native
state
including
most
of
its
millionaires
in
a
quixotic
attempt
to
purge
it
of
the
infamy
which
had
been
implanted
by
old
jacob
sangster
maud
sangster
was
theodore
oldest
daughter
the
sangster
stock
uniformly
bred
fighters
among
the
men
and
beauties
among
the
women
nor
was
maud
an
exception
also
she
must
have
inherited
some
of
the
virus
of
adventure
from
the
sangster
breed
for
she
had
come
to
womanhood
and
done
a
multitude
of
things
of
which
no
woman
in
her
position
should
have
been
guilty
a
match
in
ten
thousand
she
remained
unmarried
she
had
sojourned
in
europe
without
bringing
home
a
nobleman
for
spouse
and
had
declined
a
goodly
portion
of
her
own
set
at
home
she
had
gone
in
for
outdoor
sports
won
the
tennis
championship
of
the
state
kept
the
society
weeklies
agog
with
her
unconventionalities
walked
from
san
mateo
to
santa
cruz
against
time
on
a
wager
and
once
caused
a
sensation
by
playing
polo
in
a
men
team
at
a
private
burlingame
practice
game
incidentally
she
had
gone
in
for
art
and
maintained
a
studio
in
san
francisco
latin
quarter
all
this
had
been
of
little
moment
until
her
father
reform
attack
became
acute
passionately
independent
never
yet
having
met
the
man
to
whom
she
could
gladly
submit
and
bored
by
those
who
had
aspired
she
resented
her
father
interference
with
her
way
of
life
and
put
the
climax
on
all
her
social
misdeeds
by
leaving
home
and
going
to
work
on
the
beginning
at
twenty
dollars
a
week
her
salary
had
swiftly
risen
to
fifty
her
work
was
principally
musical
dramatic
and
art
criticism
though
she
was
not
above
mere
journalistic
stunts
if
they
promised
to
be
sufficiently
interesting
thus
she
scooped
the
big
interview
with
morgan
at
a
time
when
he
was
being
futilely
trailed
by
a
dozen
new
york
star
journalists
went
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
golden
gate
in
a
diver
suit
and
flew
with
rood
the
bird
man
when
he
broke
all
records
of
continuous
flight
by
reaching
as
far
as
riverside
now
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
maud
sangster
was
a
amazon
on
the
contrary
she
was
a
slender
young
woman
of
three
or
four
and
twenty
of
medium
stature
and
possessing
uncommonly
small
hands
and
feet
for
an
outdoor
woman
or
any
other
kind
of
a
woman
also
far
in
excess
of
most
outdoor
women
she
knew
how
to
be
daintily
feminine
it
was
on
her
own
suggestion
that
she
received
the
editor
commission
to
interview
pat
glendon
with
the
exception
of
having
caught
a
glimpse
once
of
bob
fitzsimmons
in
evening
dress
at
the
palace
grill
she
had
never
seen
a
prizefighter
in
her
life
nor
was
she
curious
to
see
one
at
least
she
had
not
been
curious
until
young
pat
glendon
came
to
san
francisco
to
train
for
his
fight
with
nat
powers
then
his
newspaper
reputation
had
aroused
her
the
abysmal
brute
it
certainly
must
be
worth
seeing
from
what
she
read
of
him
she
gleaned
that
he
was
a
profoundly
stupid
and
with
the
sullenness
and
ferocity
of
a
jungle
beast
true
his
published
photographs
did
not
show
all
that
but
they
did
show
the
hugeness
of
brawn
that
might
be
expected
to
go
with
it
and
so
accompanied
by
a
staff
photographer
she
went
out
to
the
training
quarters
at
the
cliff
house
at
the
hour
appointed
by
stubener
that
real
estate
owner
was
having
trouble
pat
was
rebellious
he
sat
one
big
leg
dangling
over
the
side
of
the
arm
chair
and
sonnets
face
downward
on
his
knee
orating
against
the
new
woman
what
do
they
want
to
come
butting
into
the
game
for
he
demanded
it
not
their
place
what
do
they
know
about
it
anyway
the
men
are
bad
enough
as
it
is
i
not
a
holy
show
this
woman
coming
here
to
make
me
one
i
never
have
stood
for
women
around
the
training
quarters
and
i
do
care
if
she
is
a
reporter
but
she
not
an
ordinary
reporter
stubener
interposed
heard
of
the
sangsters
the
millionaires
pat
nodded
well
she
one
of
them
she
high
society
and
all
that
stuff
she
could
be
running
with
the
blingum
crowd
now
if
she
wanted
to
instead
of
working
for
wages
her
old
man
worth
fifty
millions
if
worth
a
cent
then
what
she
working
on
a
paper
for
keeping
some
poor
devil
out
of
a
job
she
and
the
old
man
fell
out
had
a
tiff
or
something
about
the
time
he
started
to
clean
up
san
francisco
she
quit
all
left
home
and
got
a
job
and
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
pat
she
can
everlastingly
sling
english
there
is
a
on
the
coast
can
touch
her
when
she
gets
going
pat
began
to
show
interest
and
stubener
hurried
on
she
writes
poetry
too
the
regular
stuff
just
like
you
only
i
guess
hers
is
better
because
she
published
a
whole
book
of
it
once
and
she
writes
up
the
shows
she
interviews
every
big
actor
that
hits
this
burg
i
seen
her
name
in
the
papers
pat
commented
sure
you
have
and
you
honored
pat
by
her
coming
to
interview
you
it
wo
bother
you
any
i
stick
right
by
and
give
her
most
of
the
dope
myself
you
know
i
always
done
that
pat
looked
his
gratitude
and
another
thing
pat
do
forget
you
got
to
put
up
with
this
interviewing
it
part
of
your
business
it
big
advertising
and
it
comes
free
we
ca
buy
it
it
interests
people
draws
the
crowds
and
it
crowds
that
pile
up
the
gate
receipts
he
stopped
and
listened
then
looked
at
his
watch
i
think
that
her
now
i
go
and
get
her
and
bring
her
in
i
tip
it
off
to
her
to
cut
it
short
you
know
and
it
wo
take
long
he
turned
in
the
doorway
and
be
decent
pat
do
shut
up
like
a
clam
talk
a
bit
to
her
when
she
asks
you
questions
pat
put
the
sonnets
on
the
table
took
up
a
newspaper
and
was
apparently
deep
in
its
contents
when
the
two
entered
the
room
and
he
stood
up
the
meeting
was
a
mutual
shock
when
blue
eyes
met
gray
it
was
almost
as
if
the
man
and
the
woman
shouted
triumphantly
to
each
other
as
if
each
had
found
something
sought
and
unexpected
but
this
was
for
the
instant
only
each
had
anticipated
in
the
other
something
so
totally
different
that
the
next
moment
the
clear
cry
of
recognition
gave
way
to
confusion
as
is
the
way
of
women
she
was
the
first
to
achieve
control
and
she
did
it
without
having
given
any
outward
sign
that
she
had
ever
lost
it
she
advanced
most
of
the
distance
across
the
floor
to
meet
glendon
as
for
him
he
scarcely
knew
how
he
stumbled
through
the
introduction
here
was
a
woman
a
woman
he
had
not
known
that
such
a
creature
could
exist
the
few
women
he
had
noticed
had
never
prefigured
this
he
wondered
what
old
pat
judgment
would
have
been
of
her
if
she
was
the
sort
he
had
recommended
to
hang
on
to
with
both
his
hands
he
discovered
that
in
some
way
he
was
holding
her
hand
he
looked
at
it
curious
and
fascinated
marveling
at
its
fragility
she
on
the
other
hand
had
proceeded
to
obliterate
the
echoes
of
that
first
clear
call
it
had
been
a
peculiar
experience
that
was
all
this
sudden
of
her
toward
this
strange
man
for
was
not
he
the
abysmal
brute
of
the
the
great
fighting
stupid
bulk
of
a
male
animal
who
hammered
up
his
fellow
males
of
the
same
stupid
order
she
smiled
at
the
way
he
continued
to
hold
her
hand
i
have
it
back
please
glendon
she
said
i
i
really
need
it
you
know
he
looked
at
her
blankly
followed
her
gaze
to
her
imprisoned
hand
and
dropped
it
in
a
rush
of
awkwardness
that
sent
the
blood
in
a
manifest
blush
to
his
face
she
noted
the
blush
and
the
thought
came
to
her
that
he
did
not
seem
quite
the
uncouth
brute
she
had
pictured
she
could
not
conceive
of
a
brute
blushing
at
anything
and
also
she
found
herself
pleased
with
the
fact
that
he
lacked
the
easy
glibness
to
murmur
an
apology
but
the
way
he
devoured
her
with
his
eyes
was
disconcerting
he
stared
at
her
as
if
in
a
trance
while
his
cheeks
flushed
even
more
redly
stubener
by
this
time
had
fetched
a
chair
for
her
and
glendon
automatically
sank
down
into
his
he
in
fine
shape
miss
sangster
in
fine
shape
the
manager
was
saying
that
right
is
it
pat
never
felt
better
in
your
life
glendon
was
bothered
by
this
his
brows
contracted
in
a
troubled
way
and
he
made
no
reply
i
wanted
to
meet
you
for
a
long
time
glendon
miss
sangster
said
i
never
interviewed
a
pugilist
before
so
if
i
do
go
about
it
expertly
you
forgive
me
i
am
sure
maybe
you
better
start
in
by
seeing
him
in
action
was
the
manager
suggestion
while
he
getting
into
his
fighting
togs
i
can
tell
you
a
lot
about
him
fresh
stuff
too
we
call
in
walsh
pat
and
go
a
couple
of
rounds
we
do
nothing
of
the
sort
glendon
growled
roughly
in
just
the
way
an
abysmal
brute
should
go
ahead
with
the
interview
the
business
went
ahead
unsatisfactorily
stubener
did
most
of
the
talking
and
suggesting
which
was
sufficient
to
irritate
maud
sangster
while
pat
volunteered
nothing
she
studied
his
fine
countenance
the
eyes
clear
blue
and
wide
apart
the
almost
aquiline
nose
the
firm
chaste
lips
that
were
sweet
in
a
masculine
way
in
their
curl
at
the
corners
and
that
gave
no
hint
of
any
sullenness
it
was
a
baffling
personality
she
concluded
if
what
the
papers
said
of
him
was
so
in
vain
she
sought
for
earmarks
of
the
brute
and
in
vain
she
attempted
to
establish
contacts
for
one
thing
she
knew
too
little
about
and
the
ring
and
whenever
she
opened
up
a
lead
it
was
promptly
snatched
away
by
the
stubener
it
must
be
most
interesting
this
life
of
a
pugilist
she
said
once
adding
with
a
sigh
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
it
tell
me
why
do
you
fight
oh
aside
from
money
reasons
this
latter
to
forestall
stubener
do
you
enjoy
fighting
are
you
stirred
by
it
by
pitting
yourself
against
other
men
i
hardly
know
how
to
express
what
i
mean
so
you
must
be
patient
with
me
pat
and
stubener
began
speaking
together
but
for
once
pat
bore
his
manager
down
i
did
care
for
it
at
first
you
see
it
was
too
dead
easy
for
him
stubener
interrupted
but
later
pat
went
on
when
i
encountered
the
better
fighters
the
real
big
clever
ones
where
i
was
more
on
your
mettle
she
suggested
yes
that
it
more
on
my
mettle
i
found
i
did
care
for
it
a
great
deal
in
fact
but
still
it
not
so
absorbing
to
me
as
it
might
be
you
see
while
each
battle
is
a
sort
of
problem
which
i
must
work
out
with
my
wits
and
muscle
yet
to
me
the
issue
is
never
in
doubt
he
never
had
a
fight
go
to
a
decision
stubener
proclaimed
won
every
battle
by
the
route
and
it
this
certainty
of
the
outcome
that
robs
it
of
what
i
imagine
must
be
its
finest
thrills
pat
concluded
maybe
you
get
some
of
them
thrills
when
you
go
up
against
jim
hanford
said
the
manager
pat
smiled
but
did
not
speak
tell
me
some
more
she
urged
more
about
the
way
you
feel
when
you
are
fighting
and
then
pat
amazed
his
manager
miss
sangster
and
himself
by
blurting
out
it
seems
to
me
i
do
want
to
talk
with
you
on
such
things
it
as
if
there
are
things
more
important
for
you
and
me
to
talk
about
i
he
stopped
abruptly
aware
of
what
he
was
saying
but
unaware
of
why
he
was
saying
it
yes
she
cried
eagerly
that
it
that
is
what
makes
a
good
interview
the
real
personality
you
know
but
pat
remained
and
stubener
wandered
away
on
a
statistical
comparison
of
his
champion
weights
measurements
and
expansions
with
those
of
sandow
the
terrible
turk
jeffries
and
the
other
modern
strong
men
this
was
of
little
interest
to
maud
sangster
and
she
showed
that
she
was
bored
her
eyes
chanced
to
rest
on
the
sonnets
she
picked
the
book
up
and
glanced
inquiringly
at
stubener
that
pat
he
said
he
goes
in
for
that
kind
of
stuff
and
color
photography
and
art
exhibits
and
such
things
but
for
heaven
sake
do
publish
anything
about
it
it
would
ruin
his
reputation
she
looked
accusingly
at
glendon
who
immediately
became
awkward
to
her
it
was
delicious
a
shy
young
man
with
the
body
of
a
giant
who
was
one
of
the
kings
of
bruisers
and
who
read
poetry
and
went
to
art
exhibits
and
experimented
with
color
photography
of
a
surety
there
was
no
abysmal
brute
here
his
very
shyness
she
divined
now
was
due
to
sensitiveness
and
not
stupidity
shakespeare
sonnets
this
was
a
phase
that
would
bear
investigation
but
stubener
stole
the
opportunity
away
and
was
back
chanting
his
everlasting
statistics
a
few
minutes
later
and
most
unwittingly
she
opened
up
the
biggest
lead
of
all
that
first
sharp
attraction
toward
him
had
begun
to
stir
again
after
the
discovery
of
the
sonnets
the
magnificent
frame
of
his
the
handsome
face
the
chaste
lips
the
eyes
the
fine
forehead
which
the
short
crop
of
blond
hair
did
not
hide
the
aura
of
physical
and
cleanness
which
he
seemed
to
emanate
all
this
and
more
that
she
sensed
drew
her
as
she
had
never
been
drawn
by
any
man
and
yet
through
her
mind
kept
running
the
nasty
rumors
that
she
had
heard
only
the
day
before
at
the
office
you
were
right
she
said
there
is
something
more
important
to
talk
about
there
is
something
in
my
mind
i
want
you
to
reconcile
for
me
do
you
mind
pat
shook
his
head
if
i
am
frank
abominably
frank
i
heard
the
men
sometimes
talking
of
particular
fights
and
of
the
betting
odds
and
while
i
gave
no
heed
to
it
at
the
time
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
firmly
agreed
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
trickery
and
cheating
connected
with
the
sport
now
when
i
look
at
you
for
instance
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
how
you
can
be
a
party
to
such
cheating
i
can
understand
your
liking
the
sport
for
a
sport
as
well
as
for
the
money
it
brings
you
but
i
ca
understand
there
nothing
to
understand
stubener
broke
in
while
pat
lips
were
wreathed
in
a
gentle
tolerant
smile
it
all
fairy
tales
this
talk
about
faking
about
fixed
fights
and
all
that
rot
nothing
to
it
miss
sangster
i
assure
you
and
now
let
me
tell
you
about
how
i
discovered
glendon
it
was
a
letter
i
got
from
his
father
but
maud
sangster
refused
to
be
and
addressed
herself
to
pat
listen
i
remember
one
case
particularly
it
was
some
fight
that
took
place
several
months
ago
i
forget
the
contestants
one
of
the
editors
of
the
told
me
he
intended
to
make
a
good
winning
he
did
hope
he
said
he
intended
he
said
he
was
on
the
inside
and
was
betting
on
the
number
of
rounds
he
told
me
the
fight
would
end
in
the
nineteenth
this
was
the
night
before
and
the
next
day
he
triumphantly
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
had
ended
in
that
very
round
i
did
think
anything
of
it
one
way
or
the
other
i
was
not
interested
in
then
but
i
am
now
at
the
time
it
seemed
quite
in
accord
with
the
vague
conception
i
had
about
fighting
so
you
see
it
is
all
fairy
tales
is
it
i
know
that
fight
glendon
said
it
was
owen
and
murgweather
and
it
did
end
in
the
nineteenth
round
sam
and
she
said
she
heard
that
round
named
the
day
before
how
do
you
account
for
it
sam
how
do
you
account
for
a
man
picking
a
lucky
lottery
ticket
the
manager
evaded
while
getting
his
wits
together
to
answer
the
very
point
men
who
study
form
and
condition
and
seconds
and
rules
and
such
things
often
pick
the
number
of
rounds
just
as
men
have
been
known
to
pick
shots
in
the
races
and
do
forget
one
thing
for
every
man
that
wins
there
another
that
loses
there
another
that
did
pick
right
miss
sangster
i
assure
you
on
my
honor
that
faking
and
fixing
in
the
fight
game
is
is
what
is
your
opinion
mr
glendon
she
asked
the
same
as
mine
stubener
snatched
the
answer
he
knows
what
i
say
is
true
every
word
of
it
he
never
fought
anything
but
a
straight
fight
in
his
life
is
that
right
pat
yes
it
right
pat
affirmed
and
the
peculiar
thing
to
maud
sangster
was
that
she
was
convinced
he
spoke
the
truth
she
brushed
her
forehead
with
her
hand
as
if
to
rid
herself
of
the
bepuzzlement
that
clouded
her
brain
listen
she
said
last
night
the
same
editor
told
me
that
your
forthcoming
fight
was
arranged
to
the
very
round
in
which
it
would
end
stubener
was
verging
on
a
panic
but
pat
speech
saved
him
from
replying
then
the
editor
lies
pat
voice
boomed
now
for
the
first
time
he
did
not
lie
before
about
that
other
fight
she
challenged
what
round
did
he
say
my
fight
with
nat
powers
would
end
in
before
she
could
answer
the
manager
was
into
the
thick
of
it
oh
rats
pat
he
cried
shut
up
it
only
the
regular
run
of
ring
rumors
let
get
on
with
this
interview
he
was
ignored
by
glendon
whose
eyes
bent
on
hers
were
no
longer
mildly
blue
but
harsh
and
imperative
she
was
sure
now
that
she
had
stumbled
on
something
tremendous
something
that
would
explain
all
that
had
baffled
her
at
the
same
time
she
thrilled
to
the
mastery
of
his
voice
and
gaze
here
was
a
male
man
who
would
take
hold
of
life
and
shake
out
of
it
what
he
wanted
what
round
did
the
editor
say
glendon
reiterated
his
demand
for
the
love
of
mike
pat
stop
this
foolishness
stubener
broke
in
i
wish
you
would
give
me
a
chance
to
answer
maud
sangster
said
i
guess
i
able
to
talk
with
miss
sangster
glendon
added
you
get
out
sam
go
off
and
take
care
of
that
photographer
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
tense
silent
moment
then
the
manager
moved
slowly
to
the
door
opened
it
and
turned
his
head
to
listen
and
now
what
round
did
he
say
i
hope
i
have
made
a
mistake
she
said
tremulously
but
i
am
very
sure
that
he
said
the
sixteenth
round
she
saw
surprise
and
anger
leap
into
glendon
face
and
the
anger
and
accusation
in
the
glance
he
cast
at
his
manager
and
she
knew
the
blow
had
driven
home
and
there
was
reason
for
his
anger
he
knew
he
had
talked
it
over
with
stubener
and
they
had
reached
a
decision
to
give
the
audience
a
good
run
for
its
money
without
unnecessarily
prolonging
the
fight
and
to
end
it
in
the
sixteenth
and
here
was
a
woman
from
a
newspaper
office
naming
the
very
round
stubener
in
the
doorway
looked
limp
and
pale
and
it
was
evident
he
was
holding
himself
together
by
an
effort
i
see
you
later
pat
told
him
shut
the
door
behind
you
the
door
closed
and
the
two
were
left
alone
glendon
did
not
speak
the
expression
on
his
face
was
frankly
one
of
trouble
and
perplexity
well
she
asked
he
got
up
and
towered
above
her
then
sat
down
again
moistening
his
lips
with
his
tongue
i
tell
you
one
thing
he
finally
said
the
fight
wo
end
in
the
sixteenth
round
she
did
not
speak
but
her
unconvinced
and
quizzical
smile
hurt
him
you
wait
and
see
miss
sangster
and
you
see
that
editor
man
is
mistaken
you
mean
the
program
is
to
be
changed
she
queried
audaciously
he
quivered
to
the
cut
of
her
words
i
am
not
accustomed
to
lying
he
said
stiffly
even
to
women
neither
have
you
to
me
nor
have
you
denied
the
program
is
to
be
changed
perhaps
glendon
i
am
stupid
but
i
fail
to
see
the
difference
in
what
number
the
final
round
occurs
so
long
as
it
is
predetermined
and
known
i
tell
you
that
round
and
not
another
soul
shall
know
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
smiled
it
sounds
to
me
very
much
like
a
racing
tip
they
are
always
given
that
way
you
know
furthermore
i
am
not
quite
stupid
and
i
know
there
is
something
wrong
here
why
were
you
made
angry
by
my
naming
the
round
why
were
you
angry
with
your
manager
why
did
you
send
him
from
the
room
for
reply
glendon
walked
over
to
the
window
as
if
to
look
out
where
he
changed
his
mind
and
partly
turned
and
she
knew
without
seeing
that
he
was
studying
her
face
he
came
back
and
sat
down
you
said
i
have
lied
to
you
miss
sangster
and
you
were
right
i
have
he
paused
groping
painfully
for
a
correct
statement
of
the
situation
now
do
you
think
you
can
believe
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
will
you
take
the
word
of
a
she
nodded
gravely
looking
him
straight
in
the
eyes
and
certain
that
what
he
was
about
to
tell
was
the
truth
i
always
fought
straight
and
square
i
never
touched
a
piece
of
dirty
money
in
my
life
nor
attempted
a
dirty
trick
now
i
can
go
on
from
that
you
shaken
me
up
pretty
badly
by
what
you
told
me
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
i
ca
pass
a
snap
judgment
on
it
i
do
know
but
it
looks
bad
that
what
troubles
me
for
see
you
stubener
and
i
have
talked
this
fight
over
and
it
was
understood
between
us
that
i
would
end
the
fight
in
the
sixteenth
round
now
you
bring
the
same
word
how
did
that
editor
know
not
from
me
stubener
must
have
let
it
out
unless
he
stopped
to
debate
the
problem
unless
that
editor
is
a
lucky
guesser
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
about
it
i
have
to
keep
my
eyes
open
and
wait
and
learn
every
word
i
given
you
is
straight
and
there
my
hand
on
it
again
he
towered
out
of
his
chair
and
over
to
her
her
small
hand
was
gripped
in
his
big
one
as
she
arose
to
meet
him
and
after
a
fair
straight
look
into
the
eyes
between
them
both
glanced
unconsciously
at
the
clasped
hands
she
felt
that
she
had
never
been
more
aware
that
she
was
a
woman
the
sex
emphasis
of
those
two
hands
the
soft
and
fragile
feminine
and
the
heavy
muscular
masculine
was
startling
glendon
was
the
first
to
speak
you
could
be
hurt
so
easily
he
said
and
at
the
same
time
she
felt
the
firmness
of
his
grip
almost
caressingly
relax
she
remembered
the
old
prussian
king
love
for
giants
and
laughed
at
the
incongruity
of
the
as
she
withdrew
her
hand
i
am
glad
you
came
here
he
said
then
hurried
on
awkwardly
to
make
an
explanation
which
the
warm
light
of
admiration
in
his
eyes
belied
i
mean
because
maybe
you
have
opened
my
eyes
to
the
crooked
dealing
that
has
been
going
on
you
have
surprised
me
she
urged
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
is
so
generally
understood
that
is
full
of
crookedness
that
i
can
not
understand
how
you
one
of
its
chief
exponents
could
be
ignorant
of
it
i
thought
as
a
matter
of
course
that
you
would
know
all
about
it
and
now
you
have
convinced
me
that
you
never
dreamed
of
it
you
must
be
different
from
other
fighters
he
nodded
his
head
that
explains
it
i
guess
and
that
what
comes
of
keeping
away
from
it
from
the
other
fighters
and
promoters
and
sports
it
was
easy
to
pull
the
wool
over
my
eyes
yet
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
it
has
really
been
pulled
over
or
not
you
see
i
am
going
to
find
out
for
myself
and
change
it
she
queried
rather
breathlessly
convinced
somehow
that
he
could
do
anything
he
set
out
to
accomplish
no
quit
it
was
his
answer
if
it
is
straight
i
wo
have
anything
more
to
do
with
it
and
one
thing
is
certain
this
coming
fight
with
nat
powers
wo
end
in
the
sixteenth
round
if
there
is
any
truth
in
that
editor
tip
they
all
be
fooled
instead
of
putting
him
out
in
the
sixteenth
i
let
the
fight
run
on
into
the
twenties
you
wait
and
see
and
i
not
to
tell
the
editor
she
was
on
her
feet
now
preparing
to
go
certainly
not
if
he
is
only
guessing
let
him
take
his
chances
and
if
there
anything
rotten
about
it
he
deserves
to
lose
all
he
bets
this
is
to
be
a
little
secret
between
you
and
me
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
name
the
round
to
you
i
wo
run
it
into
the
twenties
i
stop
nat
powers
in
the
eighteenth
and
i
not
whisper
it
she
assured
him
i
like
to
ask
you
a
favor
he
said
tentatively
maybe
it
a
big
favor
she
showed
her
acquiescence
in
her
face
as
if
it
were
already
granted
and
he
went
on
of
course
i
know
you
wo
use
this
faking
in
the
interview
but
i
want
more
than
that
i
do
want
you
to
publish
anything
at
all
she
gave
him
a
quick
look
with
her
searching
gray
eyes
then
surprised
herself
by
her
answer
certainly
she
said
it
will
not
be
published
i
wo
write
a
line
of
it
i
knew
it
he
said
simply
for
the
moment
she
was
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
thanks
and
the
next
moment
she
was
glad
that
he
had
not
thanked
her
she
sensed
the
different
foundation
he
was
building
under
this
meeting
of
an
hour
with
her
and
she
became
daringly
explorative
how
did
you
know
it
she
asked
i
do
know
he
shook
his
head
i
ca
explain
it
i
knew
it
as
a
matter
of
course
somehow
it
seems
to
me
i
know
a
lot
about
you
and
me
but
why
not
publish
the
interview
as
your
manager
says
it
is
good
advertising
i
know
it
he
answered
slowly
but
i
do
want
to
know
you
that
way
i
think
it
would
hurt
if
you
should
publish
it
i
do
want
to
think
that
i
knew
you
professionally
i
like
to
remember
our
talk
here
as
a
talk
between
a
man
and
a
woman
i
do
know
whether
you
understand
what
i
driving
at
but
it
the
way
i
feel
i
want
to
remember
this
just
as
a
man
and
a
woman
as
he
spoke
in
his
eyes
was
all
the
expression
with
which
a
man
looks
at
a
woman
she
felt
the
force
and
beat
of
him
and
she
felt
strangely
and
awkward
before
this
man
who
had
been
reputed
and
awkward
he
could
certainly
talk
straighter
to
the
point
and
more
convincingly
than
most
men
and
what
struck
her
most
forcibly
was
her
own
inborn
certainty
that
it
was
mere
naïve
and
simple
frankness
on
his
part
and
not
a
practised
artfulness
he
saw
her
into
her
machine
and
gave
her
another
thrill
when
he
said
once
again
their
hands
were
clasped
as
he
said
some
day
i
see
you
again
i
want
to
see
you
again
somehow
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
last
word
has
not
been
said
between
us
and
as
the
machine
rolled
away
she
was
aware
of
a
similar
feeling
she
had
not
seen
the
last
of
this
very
disquieting
pat
glendon
king
of
the
bruisers
and
abysmal
brute
back
in
the
training
quarters
glendon
encountered
his
perturbed
manager
what
did
you
fire
me
out
for
stubener
demanded
we
finished
a
hell
of
a
mess
you
made
you
never
stood
for
meeting
a
reporter
alone
before
and
now
you
see
when
that
interview
comes
out
glendon
who
had
been
regarding
him
with
cool
amusement
made
as
if
to
turn
and
pass
on
and
then
changed
his
mind
it
wo
come
out
he
said
stubener
looked
up
sharply
i
asked
her
not
to
glendon
explained
then
stubener
exploded
as
if
she
kill
a
juicy
thing
like
that
glendon
became
very
cold
and
his
voice
was
harsh
and
grating
it
wo
be
published
she
told
me
so
and
to
doubt
it
is
to
call
her
a
liar
the
irish
flame
was
in
his
eyes
and
by
that
and
by
the
unconscious
clenching
of
his
hands
stubener
who
knew
the
strength
of
them
and
of
the
man
he
faced
no
longer
dared
to
doubt
vii
it
did
not
take
stubener
long
to
find
out
that
glendon
intended
extending
the
distance
of
the
fight
though
try
as
he
would
he
could
get
no
hint
of
the
number
of
the
round
he
wasted
no
time
however
and
privily
clinched
certain
arrangements
with
nat
powers
and
nat
powers
manager
powers
had
a
faithful
following
of
bettors
and
the
betting
syndicate
was
not
to
be
denied
its
harvest
on
the
night
of
the
fight
maud
sangster
was
guilty
of
a
more
daring
unconventionality
than
any
she
had
yet
committed
though
no
whisper
of
it
leaked
out
to
shock
society
under
the
protection
of
the
editor
she
occupied
a
seat
her
hair
and
most
of
her
face
were
hidden
under
a
slouch
hat
while
she
wore
a
man
long
overcoat
that
fell
to
her
heels
entering
in
the
thick
of
the
crowd
she
was
not
noticed
nor
did
the
newspaper
men
in
the
press
seats
against
the
ring
directly
in
front
of
her
recognize
her
as
was
the
growing
custom
there
were
no
preliminary
bouts
and
she
had
barely
gained
her
seat
when
roars
of
applause
announced
the
arrival
of
nat
powers
he
came
down
the
aisle
in
the
midst
of
his
seconds
and
she
was
almost
frightened
by
the
formidable
bulk
of
him
yet
he
leaped
the
ropes
as
lightly
as
a
man
half
his
weight
and
grinned
acknowledgment
to
the
tumultuous
greeting
that
arose
from
all
the
house
he
was
not
pretty
two
cauliflower
ears
attested
his
profession
and
its
attendant
brutality
while
his
broken
nose
had
been
so
often
spread
over
his
face
as
to
defy
the
surgeon
art
to
reconstruct
it
another
uproar
heralded
the
arrival
of
glendon
and
she
watched
him
eagerly
as
he
went
through
the
ropes
to
his
corner
but
it
was
not
until
the
tedious
time
of
announcements
introductions
and
challenges
was
over
that
the
two
men
threw
off
their
wraps
and
faced
each
other
in
ring
costume
concentrated
upon
them
from
overhead
was
the
white
glare
of
many
electric
lights
this
for
the
benefit
of
the
moving
picture
cameras
and
she
felt
as
she
looked
at
the
two
sharply
contrasted
men
that
it
was
in
glendon
that
she
saw
the
thoroughbred
and
in
powers
the
abysmal
brute
both
looked
their
parts
glendon
clean
cut
in
face
and
form
softly
and
massively
beautiful
powers
almost
asymmetrically
rugged
and
heavily
matted
with
hair
as
they
made
their
preliminary
pose
for
the
cameras
confronting
each
other
in
fighting
attitudes
it
chanced
that
glendon
gaze
dropped
down
through
the
ropes
and
rested
on
her
face
though
he
gave
no
sign
she
knew
with
a
swift
leap
of
the
heart
that
he
had
recognized
her
the
next
moment
the
gong
sounded
the
announcer
cried
let
her
go
and
the
battle
was
on
it
was
a
good
fight
there
was
no
blood
no
marring
and
both
were
clever
half
of
the
first
round
was
spent
in
feeling
each
other
out
but
maud
sangster
found
the
play
and
feint
and
tap
of
the
gloves
sufficiently
exciting
during
some
of
the
fiercer
rallies
in
later
stages
of
the
fight
the
editor
was
compelled
to
touch
her
arm
to
remind
her
who
she
was
and
where
she
was
powers
fought
easily
and
cleanly
as
became
the
hero
of
half
a
hundred
ring
battles
and
an
admiring
claque
applauded
his
every
cleverness
yet
he
did
not
unduly
exert
himself
save
in
occasional
strenuous
rallies
that
brought
the
audience
yelling
to
its
feet
in
the
mistaken
notion
that
he
was
getting
his
man
it
was
at
such
a
moment
when
her
unpractised
eye
could
not
inform
her
that
glendon
was
escaping
serious
damage
that
the
editor
leaned
to
her
and
said
young
pat
will
win
all
right
he
a
comer
and
they
ca
stop
him
but
he
win
in
the
sixteenth
and
not
before
or
after
she
asked
she
almost
laughed
at
the
certitude
of
her
companion
negative
she
knew
better
powers
was
noted
for
hunting
his
man
from
moment
to
moment
and
round
to
round
and
glendon
was
content
to
accede
to
this
program
his
defense
was
admirable
and
he
threw
in
just
enough
of
offense
to
whet
the
edge
of
the
audience
interest
though
he
knew
he
was
scheduled
to
lose
powers
had
had
too
long
a
ring
experience
to
hesitate
from
knocking
his
man
out
if
the
opportunity
offered
he
had
had
the
double
cross
worked
too
often
on
him
to
be
chary
in
working
it
on
others
if
he
got
his
chance
he
was
prepared
to
knock
his
man
out
and
let
the
syndicate
go
hang
thanks
to
clever
press
publicity
the
idea
was
prevalent
that
at
last
young
glendon
had
met
his
master
in
his
heart
powers
however
knew
that
it
was
himself
who
had
encountered
the
better
man
more
than
once
in
the
faster
he
received
the
weight
of
punches
that
he
knew
had
been
deliberately
made
no
heavier
on
glendon
part
there
were
times
and
times
when
a
slip
or
error
of
judgment
could
have
exposed
him
to
one
of
his
blows
and
lost
him
the
fight
yet
his
was
that
almost
miraculous
power
of
accurate
timing
and
distancing
and
his
confidence
was
not
shaken
by
the
several
close
shaves
he
experienced
he
had
never
lost
a
fight
never
been
knocked
down
and
he
had
always
been
so
thoroughly
the
master
of
the
man
he
faced
that
such
a
possibility
was
unthinkable
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
round
both
men
were
in
good
condition
though
powers
was
breathing
a
trifle
heavily
and
there
were
men
in
the
ringside
seats
offering
odds
that
he
would
blow
up
it
was
just
before
the
gong
for
the
sixteenth
round
struck
that
stubener
leaning
over
glendon
from
behind
in
his
corner
whispered
are
you
going
to
get
him
now
glendon
with
a
back
toss
of
his
head
shook
it
and
laughed
mockingly
up
into
his
manager
anxious
face
with
the
stroke
of
the
gong
for
the
sixteenth
round
glendon
was
surprised
to
see
powers
cut
loose
from
the
first
second
it
was
a
tornado
of
fighting
and
glendon
was
hard
put
to
escape
serious
damage
he
blocked
clinched
ducked
sidestepped
was
rushed
backward
against
the
ropes
and
was
met
by
fresh
rushes
when
he
surged
out
to
center
several
times
powers
left
inviting
openings
but
glendon
refused
to
loose
the
of
a
blow
that
would
drop
his
man
he
was
reserving
that
blow
for
two
rounds
later
not
in
the
whole
fight
had
he
ever
exerted
his
full
strength
nor
struck
with
the
force
that
was
in
him
for
two
minutes
without
the
slightest
powers
went
at
him
hammer
and
tongs
in
another
minute
the
round
would
be
over
and
the
betting
syndicate
hard
hit
but
that
minute
was
not
to
be
they
had
just
come
together
in
the
center
of
the
ring
it
was
as
ordinary
a
clinch
as
any
in
the
fight
save
that
powers
was
struggling
and
roughing
it
every
instant
glendon
whipped
his
left
over
in
a
crisp
but
easy
jolt
to
the
side
of
the
face
it
was
like
any
of
a
score
of
similar
jolts
he
had
already
delivered
in
the
course
of
the
fight
to
his
amazement
he
felt
powers
go
limp
in
his
arms
and
begin
sinking
to
the
floor
on
sagging
spraddling
legs
that
refused
to
bear
his
weight
he
struck
the
floor
with
a
thump
rolled
half
over
on
his
side
and
lay
with
closed
eyes
and
motionless
the
referee
bending
above
him
was
shouting
the
count
at
the
cry
of
nine
powers
quivered
as
if
making
a
vain
effort
to
rise
ten
and
out
cried
the
referee
he
caught
glendon
hand
and
raised
it
aloft
to
the
roaring
audience
in
token
that
he
was
the
winner
for
the
first
time
in
the
ring
glendon
was
dazed
it
had
not
been
a
knockout
blow
he
could
stake
his
life
on
that
it
had
not
been
to
the
jaw
but
to
the
side
of
the
face
and
he
knew
it
had
gone
there
and
nowhere
else
yet
the
man
was
out
had
been
counted
out
and
he
had
faked
it
beautifully
that
final
thump
on
the
floor
had
been
a
convincing
masterpiece
to
the
audience
it
was
indubitably
a
knockout
and
the
moving
picture
machines
would
perpetuate
the
lie
the
editor
had
called
the
turn
after
all
and
a
crooked
turn
it
was
glendon
shot
a
swift
glance
through
the
ropes
to
the
face
of
maud
sangster
she
was
looking
straight
at
him
but
her
eyes
were
bleak
and
hard
and
there
was
neither
recognition
nor
expression
in
them
even
as
he
looked
she
turned
away
unconcernedly
and
said
something
to
the
man
beside
her
powers
seconds
were
carrying
him
to
his
corner
a
seeming
limp
wreck
of
a
man
glendon
seconds
were
advancing
upon
him
to
congratulate
him
and
to
remove
his
gloves
but
stubener
was
ahead
of
them
his
face
was
beaming
as
he
caught
glendon
right
glove
in
both
his
hands
and
cried
good
boy
pat
i
knew
you
do
it
glendon
pulled
his
glove
away
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
years
they
had
been
together
his
manager
heard
him
swear
you
go
to
hell
he
said
and
turned
to
hold
out
his
hands
for
his
seconds
to
pull
off
the
gloves
viii
that
night
after
receiving
the
editor
final
dictum
that
there
was
not
a
square
fighter
in
the
game
maud
sangster
cried
quietly
for
a
moment
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
grew
angry
and
went
to
sleep
hugely
disgusted
with
herself
and
the
world
in
general
the
next
afternoon
she
began
work
on
an
interview
with
henry
addison
that
was
destined
never
to
be
finished
it
was
in
the
private
room
that
was
accorded
her
at
the
office
that
the
thing
happened
she
had
paused
in
her
writing
to
glance
at
a
headline
in
the
afternoon
paper
announcing
that
glendon
was
matched
with
tom
cannam
when
one
of
the
brought
in
a
card
it
was
glendon
tell
him
i
ca
be
seen
she
told
the
boy
in
a
minute
he
was
back
he
says
he
coming
in
anyway
but
he
rather
have
your
permission
did
you
tell
him
i
was
busy
she
asked
yes
but
he
said
he
was
coming
just
the
same
she
made
no
answer
and
the
boy
his
eyes
shining
with
admiration
for
the
importunate
visitor
rattled
on
i
know
he
a
awful
big
guy
if
he
started
roughhousing
he
could
clean
the
whole
office
out
he
young
glendon
who
won
the
fight
last
night
very
well
then
bring
him
in
we
do
want
the
office
cleaned
out
you
know
no
greetings
were
exchanged
when
glendon
entered
she
was
as
cold
and
inhospitable
as
a
gray
day
and
neither
invited
him
to
a
chair
nor
recognized
him
with
her
eyes
sitting
half
turned
away
from
him
at
her
desk
and
waiting
for
him
to
state
his
business
he
gave
no
sign
of
how
this
cavalier
treatment
affected
him
but
plunged
directly
into
his
subject
i
want
to
talk
to
you
he
said
shortly
that
fight
it
did
end
in
that
round
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
knew
it
would
you
did
he
retorted
you
did
i
did
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
quiet
affectation
of
boredom
what
is
the
use
she
asked
is
and
we
all
know
what
it
means
the
fight
did
end
in
the
round
i
told
you
it
would
it
did
he
agreed
but
you
did
know
it
would
in
all
the
world
you
and
i
were
at
least
two
that
knew
powers
would
be
knocked
out
in
the
sixteenth
she
remained
silent
i
say
you
knew
he
would
he
spoke
peremptorily
and
when
she
still
declined
to
speak
stepped
nearer
to
her
answer
me
he
commanded
she
nodded
her
head
but
he
was
she
insisted
he
was
he
was
knocked
out
at
all
do
you
get
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
it
and
you
are
going
to
listen
i
lie
to
you
do
you
get
that
i
did
lie
to
you
i
was
a
fool
and
they
fooled
me
and
you
along
with
me
you
thought
you
saw
him
knocked
out
yet
the
blow
i
struck
was
not
heavy
enough
it
hit
him
in
the
right
place
either
he
made
believe
it
did
he
faked
that
knockout
he
paused
and
looked
at
her
expectantly
and
somehow
with
a
leap
and
thrill
she
knew
that
she
believed
him
and
she
felt
pervaded
by
a
warm
happiness
at
the
reinstatement
of
this
man
who
meant
nothing
to
her
and
whom
she
had
seen
but
twice
in
her
life
well
he
demanded
and
she
thrilled
anew
at
the
compellingness
of
him
she
stood
up
and
her
hand
went
out
to
his
i
believe
you
she
said
and
i
am
glad
most
glad
it
was
a
longer
grip
than
she
had
anticipated
he
looked
at
her
with
eyes
that
burned
and
to
which
her
own
unconsciously
answered
back
never
was
there
such
a
man
was
her
thought
her
eyes
dropped
first
and
his
followed
so
that
as
before
both
gazed
at
the
clasped
hands
he
made
a
movement
of
his
whole
body
toward
her
impulsive
and
involuntary
as
if
to
gather
her
to
him
then
checked
himself
abruptly
with
an
unmistakable
effort
she
saw
it
and
felt
the
pull
of
his
hand
as
it
started
to
draw
her
to
him
and
to
her
amazement
she
felt
the
desire
to
yield
the
desire
almost
overwhelmingly
to
be
drawn
into
the
strong
circle
of
those
arms
and
had
he
compelled
she
knew
that
she
would
not
have
refrained
she
was
almost
dizzy
when
he
checked
himself
and
with
a
closing
of
his
fingers
that
half
crushed
hers
dropped
her
hand
almost
flung
it
from
him
god
he
breathed
you
were
made
for
me
he
turned
partly
away
from
her
sweeping
his
hand
to
his
forehead
she
knew
she
would
hate
him
forever
if
he
dared
one
stammered
word
of
apology
or
explanation
but
he
seemed
to
have
the
way
always
of
doing
the
right
thing
where
she
was
concerned
she
sank
into
her
chair
and
he
into
another
first
drawing
it
around
so
as
to
face
her
across
the
corner
of
the
desk
i
spent
last
night
in
a
turkish
bath
he
said
i
sent
for
an
old
bruiser
he
was
a
friend
of
my
father
in
the
old
days
i
knew
there
could
be
a
thing
about
the
ring
he
did
know
and
i
made
him
talk
the
funny
thing
was
that
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
convince
him
that
i
did
know
the
things
i
asked
him
about
he
called
me
the
babe
in
the
woods
i
guess
he
was
right
i
was
raised
in
the
woods
and
woods
is
about
all
i
know
well
i
received
an
education
from
that
old
man
last
night
the
ring
is
rottener
than
you
told
me
it
seems
everybody
connected
with
it
is
crooked
the
very
supervisors
that
grant
the
fight
permits
graft
off
of
the
promoters
and
the
promoters
managers
and
fighters
graft
off
of
each
other
and
off
the
public
it
down
to
a
system
in
one
way
and
on
the
other
hand
they
always
do
you
know
what
the
double
cross
is
she
nodded
well
they
do
seem
to
miss
a
chance
to
give
each
other
the
double
cross
the
stuff
that
old
man
told
me
took
my
breath
away
and
here
i
been
in
the
thick
of
it
for
several
years
and
knew
nothing
of
it
i
was
a
real
babe
in
the
woods
and
yet
i
can
see
how
i
been
fooled
i
was
so
made
that
nobody
could
stop
me
i
was
bound
to
win
and
thanks
to
stubener
everything
crooked
was
kept
away
from
me
this
morning
i
cornered
spider
walsh
and
made
him
talk
he
was
my
first
trainer
you
know
and
he
followed
stubener
instructions
they
kept
me
in
ignorance
besides
i
did
herd
with
the
sporting
crowd
i
spent
my
time
hunting
and
fishing
and
monkeying
with
cameras
and
such
things
do
you
know
what
walsh
and
stubener
called
me
between
themselves
the
virgin
i
only
learned
it
this
morning
from
walsh
and
it
was
like
pulling
teeth
and
they
were
right
i
was
a
little
innocent
lamb
and
stubener
was
using
me
for
crookedness
too
only
i
did
know
it
i
can
look
back
now
and
see
how
it
was
worked
but
you
see
i
was
interested
enough
in
the
game
to
be
suspicious
i
was
born
with
a
good
body
and
a
cool
head
i
was
raised
in
the
open
and
i
was
taught
by
my
father
who
knew
more
about
fighting
than
any
man
living
or
dead
it
was
too
easy
the
ring
did
absorb
me
there
was
never
any
doubt
of
the
outcome
but
i
done
with
it
now
she
pointed
to
the
headline
announcing
his
match
with
tom
cannam
that
stubener
work
he
explained
it
was
programmed
months
ago
but
i
do
care
i
heading
for
the
mountains
i
quit
she
glanced
at
the
unfinished
interview
on
the
desk
and
sighed
how
lordly
men
are
she
said
masters
of
destiny
they
do
as
they
please
from
what
i
heard
he
interrupted
you
done
pretty
much
as
you
please
it
one
of
the
things
i
like
about
you
and
what
has
struck
me
hard
from
the
first
was
the
way
you
and
i
understand
each
other
he
broke
off
and
looked
at
her
with
burning
eyes
well
the
ring
did
one
thing
for
me
he
went
on
it
made
me
acquainted
with
you
and
when
you
find
the
one
woman
there
just
one
thing
to
do
take
her
in
your
two
hands
and
do
let
go
come
on
let
us
start
for
the
mountains
it
had
come
with
the
suddenness
of
a
and
yet
she
felt
that
she
had
been
expecting
it
her
heart
was
beating
up
and
almost
choking
her
in
a
strangely
delicious
way
here
at
least
was
the
primitive
and
the
simple
with
a
vengeance
then
too
it
seemed
a
dream
such
things
did
not
take
place
in
modern
newspaper
offices
love
could
not
be
made
in
such
fashion
it
only
so
occurred
on
the
stage
and
in
novels
he
had
arisen
and
was
holding
out
both
hands
to
her
i
do
dare
she
said
in
a
whisper
half
to
herself
i
do
dare
and
thereat
she
was
stung
by
the
quick
contempt
that
flashed
in
his
eyes
but
that
swiftly
changed
to
open
incredulity
you
dare
anything
you
wanted
he
was
saying
i
know
that
not
a
case
of
dare
but
of
want
do
you
want
she
had
arisen
and
was
now
swaying
as
if
in
a
dream
it
flashed
into
her
mind
to
wonder
if
it
were
hypnotism
she
wanted
to
glance
about
her
at
the
familiar
objects
of
the
room
in
order
to
identify
herself
with
reality
but
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
his
nor
did
she
speak
he
had
stepped
beside
her
his
hand
was
on
her
arm
and
she
leaned
toward
him
involuntarily
it
was
all
part
of
the
dream
and
it
was
no
longer
hers
to
question
anything
it
was
the
great
dare
he
was
right
she
could
dare
what
she
wanted
and
she
did
want
he
was
helping
her
into
her
jacket
she
was
thrusting
the
through
her
hair
and
even
as
she
realized
it
she
found
herself
walking
beside
him
through
the
opened
door
the
flight
of
the
duchess
and
the
statue
and
the
bust
darted
through
her
mind
then
she
remembered
waring
become
of
waring
she
murmured
travel
or
he
murmured
back
and
to
her
this
kindred
sufficient
note
was
a
vindication
of
her
madness
at
the
entrance
of
the
building
he
raised
his
hand
to
call
a
taxi
but
was
stopped
by
her
touch
on
his
arm
where
are
we
going
she
breathed
to
the
ferry
we
just
time
to
catch
that
sacramento
train
but
i
ca
go
this
way
she
protested
i
i
have
even
a
change
of
handkerchiefs
he
held
up
his
hand
again
before
replying
you
can
shop
in
sacramento
we
get
married
there
and
catch
the
night
overland
north
i
arrange
everything
by
telegraph
from
the
train
as
the
cab
drew
to
the
curb
she
looked
quickly
about
her
at
the
familiar
street
and
the
familiar
throng
then
with
almost
a
flurry
of
alarm
into
glendon
face
i
do
know
a
thing
about
you
she
said
we
know
everything
about
each
other
was
his
answer
she
felt
the
support
and
urge
of
his
arms
and
lifted
her
foot
to
the
step
the
next
moment
the
door
had
closed
he
was
beside
her
and
the
cab
was
heading
down
market
street
he
passed
his
arm
around
her
drew
her
close
and
kissed
her
when
next
she
glimpsed
his
face
she
was
certain
that
it
was
dyed
with
a
faint
blush
i
i
heard
there
was
an
art
in
kissing
he
stammered
i
do
know
anything
about
it
myself
but
i
learn
you
see
the
first
woman
i
ever
kissed
ix
where
a
jagged
peak
of
rock
thrust
above
the
vast
virgin
forest
reclined
a
man
and
a
woman
beneath
them
on
the
edge
of
the
trees
were
tethered
two
horses
behind
each
saddle
were
a
pair
of
small
the
trees
were
monotonously
huge
towering
hundreds
of
feet
into
the
air
they
ran
from
eight
to
ten
and
twelve
feet
in
diameter
many
were
much
larger
all
morning
they
had
toiled
up
the
divide
through
this
unbroken
forest
and
this
peak
of
rock
had
been
the
first
spot
where
they
could
get
out
of
the
forest
in
order
to
see
the
forest
beneath
them
and
away
far
as
they
could
see
lay
range
upon
range
of
mountains
there
was
no
end
to
these
ranges
they
rose
one
behind
another
to
the
dim
distant
skyline
where
they
faded
away
with
a
vague
promise
of
unending
extension
beyond
there
were
no
clearings
in
the
forest
north
south
east
and
west
untouched
unbroken
it
covered
the
land
with
its
mighty
growth
they
lay
feasting
their
eyes
on
the
sight
her
hand
clasped
in
one
of
his
for
this
was
their
honeymoon
and
these
were
the
redwoods
of
mendocino
across
from
shasta
they
had
come
with
horses
and
and
down
through
the
wilds
of
the
coast
counties
and
they
had
no
plan
except
to
continue
until
some
other
plan
entered
their
heads
they
were
roughly
dressed
she
in
khaki
he
in
overalls
and
woolen
shirt
the
latter
was
open
at
the
sunburned
neck
and
in
his
hugeness
he
seemed
a
fit
dweller
among
the
forest
giants
while
for
her
as
a
dweller
with
him
there
were
no
signs
of
aught
else
but
happiness
well
big
man
she
said
propping
herself
up
on
an
elbow
to
gaze
at
him
it
is
more
wonderful
than
you
promised
and
we
are
going
through
it
together
and
there
a
lot
of
the
rest
of
the
world
we
go
through
together
he
answered
shifting
his
position
so
as
to
get
her
hand
in
both
of
his
but
not
till
we
finished
with
this
she
urged
i
seem
never
to
grow
tired
of
the
big
woods
and
of
you
he
slid
effortlessly
into
a
sitting
posture
and
gathered
her
into
his
arms
oh
you
lover
she
whispered
and
i
had
given
up
hope
of
finding
such
a
one
and
i
never
hoped
at
all
i
must
just
have
known
all
the
time
that
i
was
going
to
find
you
glad
her
answer
was
a
soft
pressure
where
her
hand
rested
on
his
neck
and
for
long
minutes
they
looked
out
over
the
great
woods
and
dreamed
you
remember
i
told
you
how
i
ran
away
from
the
school
teacher
that
was
the
first
time
i
saw
this
country
i
was
on
foot
but
forty
or
fifty
miles
a
day
was
play
for
me
i
was
a
regular
indian
i
was
thinking
about
you
then
game
was
pretty
scarce
in
the
redwoods
but
there
was
plenty
of
fine
trout
that
was
when
i
camped
on
these
rocks
i
did
dream
that
some
day
i
be
back
with
you
you
and
be
a
champion
of
the
ring
too
she
suggested
no
i
did
think
about
that
at
all
dad
had
always
told
me
i
was
going
to
be
and
i
took
it
for
granted
you
see
he
was
very
wise
he
was
a
great
man
but
he
did
see
you
leaving
the
ring
i
do
know
he
was
so
careful
in
hiding
its
crookedness
from
me
that
i
think
he
feared
it
i
told
you
about
the
contract
with
stubener
dad
put
in
that
clause
about
crookedness
the
first
crooked
thing
my
manager
did
was
to
break
the
contract
and
yet
you
are
going
to
fight
this
tom
cannam
is
it
worth
while
he
looked
at
her
quickly
do
you
want
me
to
dear
lover
i
want
you
to
do
whatever
you
want
so
she
said
and
to
herself
her
words
still
ringing
in
her
ears
she
marveled
that
she
not
least
among
the
stubbornly
independent
of
the
breed
of
sangster
should
utter
them
yet
she
knew
they
were
true
and
she
was
glad
it
will
be
fun
he
said
but
i
do
understand
all
the
gleeful
details
i
have
worked
them
out
yet
you
might
help
me
in
the
first
place
i
going
to
stubener
and
the
betting
syndicate
it
will
be
part
of
the
joke
i
am
going
to
put
cannam
out
in
the
first
round
for
the
first
time
i
shall
be
really
angry
when
i
fight
poor
tom
cannam
who
as
crooked
as
the
rest
will
be
the
chief
sacrifice
you
see
i
intend
to
make
a
speech
in
the
ring
unusual
but
it
will
be
a
success
for
i
am
going
to
tell
the
audience
all
the
inside
workings
of
the
game
it
a
good
game
too
but
they
running
it
on
business
principles
and
that
what
spoils
it
but
there
i
giving
the
speech
to
you
instead
of
at
the
ring
i
wish
i
could
be
there
to
hear
she
said
he
looked
at
her
and
debated
i
like
to
have
you
but
it
sure
to
be
a
rough
time
there
is
no
telling
what
may
happen
when
i
start
my
program
but
i
come
straight
to
you
as
soon
as
it
over
and
it
will
be
the
last
appearance
of
young
glendon
in
the
ring
in
any
ring
but
dear
you
never
made
a
speech
in
your
life
she
objected
you
might
fail
he
shook
his
head
positively
i
irish
he
announced
and
what
irishman
was
there
who
speak
he
paused
to
laugh
merrily
stubener
thinks
i
crazy
says
a
man
ca
train
on
matrimony
a
lot
he
knows
about
matrimony
or
me
or
you
or
anything
except
real
estate
and
fixed
fights
but
show
him
that
night
and
poor
tom
too
i
really
feel
sorry
for
tom
my
dear
abysmal
brute
is
going
to
behave
most
abysmally
and
brutally
i
fear
she
murmured
he
laughed
i
going
to
make
a
noble
attempt
at
it
positively
my
last
appearance
you
know
and
then
it
will
be
you
you
but
if
you
want
that
last
appearance
say
the
word
of
course
i
want
it
big
man
i
want
my
big
man
for
himself
and
to
be
himself
he
must
be
himself
if
you
want
this
i
want
it
for
you
and
for
myself
too
suppose
i
said
i
wanted
to
go
on
the
stage
or
to
the
south
seas
or
the
north
pole
he
answered
slowly
almost
solemnly
then
i
say
go
ahead
because
you
are
you
and
must
be
yourself
and
do
whatever
you
want
i
love
you
because
you
are
you
and
we
both
a
silly
pair
of
lovers
she
said
when
his
embrace
had
relaxed
is
it
great
he
cried
he
stood
up
measured
the
sun
with
his
eye
and
extended
his
hand
out
over
the
big
woods
that
covered
the
serried
purple
ranges
we
got
to
sleep
out
there
somewhere
it
thirty
miles
to
the
nearest
camp
x
who
of
all
the
sports
present
will
ever
forget
the
memorable
night
at
the
golden
gate
arena
when
young
glendon
put
tom
cannam
to
sleep
and
an
even
greater
one
than
tom
cannam
kept
the
great
audience
on
the
ragged
edge
of
riot
for
an
hour
caused
the
subsequent
graft
investigation
of
the
supervisors
and
the
indictments
of
the
contractors
and
the
building
commissioners
and
pretty
generally
disrupted
the
whole
fight
game
it
was
a
complete
surprise
not
even
stubener
had
the
slightest
apprehension
of
what
was
coming
it
was
true
that
his
man
had
been
insubordinate
after
the
nat
powers
affair
and
had
run
off
and
got
married
but
all
that
was
over
young
pat
had
done
the
expected
swallowed
the
inevitable
crookedness
of
the
ring
and
come
back
into
it
again
the
golden
gate
arena
was
new
this
was
its
first
fight
and
it
was
the
biggest
building
of
the
kind
san
francisco
had
ever
erected
it
seated
thousand
and
every
seat
was
occupied
sports
had
traveled
from
all
the
world
to
be
present
and
they
had
paid
fifty
dollars
for
their
seats
the
cheapest
seat
in
the
house
had
sold
for
five
dollars
the
old
familiar
roar
of
applause
went
up
when
billy
morgan
the
veteran
announcer
climbed
through
the
ropes
and
bared
his
gray
head
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
a
heavy
crash
came
from
a
near
section
where
several
tiers
of
low
seats
had
collapsed
the
crowd
broke
into
loud
laughter
and
shouted
jocular
regrets
and
advice
to
the
victims
none
of
whom
had
been
hurt
the
crash
of
the
seats
and
the
hilarious
uproar
caused
the
captain
of
police
in
charge
to
look
at
one
of
his
lieutenants
and
lift
his
brows
in
token
that
they
would
have
their
hands
full
and
a
lively
night
one
by
one
welcomed
by
uproarious
applause
seven
doughty
old
ring
heroes
climbed
through
the
ropes
to
be
introduced
they
were
all
champions
of
the
world
billy
morgan
accompanied
each
presentation
to
the
audience
with
an
appropriate
phrase
one
was
hailed
as
honest
john
and
old
reliable
another
was
the
squarest
fighter
the
ring
ever
saw
and
of
others
the
hero
of
a
hundred
battles
and
never
threw
one
and
never
lay
down
the
gamest
of
the
old
guard
the
only
one
who
ever
came
back
the
greatest
warrior
of
them
all
and
the
hardest
nut
in
the
ring
to
crack
all
this
took
time
a
speech
was
insisted
on
from
each
of
them
and
they
mumbled
and
muttered
in
reply
with
proud
blushes
and
awkward
shamblings
the
longest
speech
was
from
old
reliable
and
lasted
nearly
a
minute
then
they
had
to
be
photographed
the
ring
filled
up
with
celebrities
with
champion
wrestlers
famous
conditioners
and
veteran
and
referees
and
swarmed
everybody
seemed
to
be
challenging
everybody
nat
powers
was
there
demanding
a
return
match
from
young
glendon
and
so
were
all
the
other
shining
lights
whom
glendon
had
snuffed
out
also
they
all
challenged
jim
hanford
who
in
turn
had
to
make
his
statement
which
was
to
the
effect
that
he
would
accord
the
next
fight
to
the
winner
of
the
one
that
was
about
to
take
place
the
audience
immediately
proceeded
to
name
the
winner
half
of
it
wildly
crying
glendon
and
the
other
half
powers
in
the
midst
of
the
pandemonium
another
tier
of
seats
went
down
and
half
a
dozen
rows
were
on
between
cheated
ticket
holders
and
the
stewards
who
had
been
reaping
a
fat
harvest
the
captain
despatched
a
message
to
headquarters
for
additional
police
details
the
crowd
was
feeling
good
when
cannam
and
glendon
made
their
ring
entrances
the
arena
resembled
a
national
political
convention
each
was
cheered
for
a
solid
five
minutes
the
ring
was
now
cleared
glendon
sat
in
his
corner
surrounded
by
his
seconds
as
usual
stubener
was
at
his
back
cannam
was
introduced
first
and
after
he
had
scraped
and
ducked
his
head
he
was
compelled
to
respond
to
the
cries
for
a
speech
he
stammered
and
halted
but
managed
to
grind
out
several
ideas
i
proud
to
be
here
he
said
and
found
space
to
capture
another
thought
while
the
applause
was
thundering
i
fought
square
i
fought
square
all
my
life
nobody
can
deny
that
and
i
going
to
do
my
best
there
were
loud
cries
of
that
right
tom
we
know
that
good
boy
tom
you
the
boy
to
fetch
the
bacon
home
then
came
glendon
turn
from
him
likewise
a
speech
was
demanded
though
for
principals
to
give
speeches
was
an
unprecedented
thing
in
the
billy
morgan
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
and
in
a
clear
powerful
voice
glendon
began
everybody
has
told
you
they
were
proud
to
be
here
he
said
i
am
not
the
audience
was
startled
and
he
paused
long
enough
to
let
it
sink
home
i
am
not
proud
of
my
company
you
wanted
a
speech
i
give
you
a
real
one
this
is
my
last
fight
after
i
leave
the
ring
for
good
why
i
have
already
told
you
i
do
like
my
company
the
is
so
crooked
that
no
man
engaged
in
it
can
hide
behind
a
corkscrew
it
is
rotten
to
the
core
from
the
little
professional
clubs
right
up
to
this
affair
the
low
rumble
of
astonishment
that
had
been
rising
at
this
point
burst
into
a
roar
there
were
loud
boos
and
hisses
and
many
began
crying
go
on
with
the
fight
we
want
the
fight
why
do
you
fight
glendon
waiting
noted
that
the
principal
disturbers
near
the
ring
were
promoters
and
managers
and
fighters
in
vain
did
he
strive
to
make
himself
heard
the
audience
was
divided
half
crying
out
fight
and
the
other
half
speech
speech
ten
minutes
of
hopeless
madness
prevailed
stubener
the
referee
the
owner
of
the
arena
and
the
promoter
of
the
fight
pleaded
with
glendon
to
go
on
with
the
fight
when
he
refused
the
referee
declared
that
he
would
award
the
fight
in
forfeit
to
cannam
if
glendon
did
not
fight
you
ca
do
it
the
latter
retorted
i
sue
you
in
all
the
courts
if
you
try
that
on
and
i
not
promise
you
that
survive
this
crowd
if
you
cheat
it
out
of
the
fight
besides
going
to
fight
but
before
i
do
i
going
to
finish
my
speech
but
it
against
the
rules
protested
the
referee
it
nothing
of
the
sort
there
not
a
word
in
the
rules
against
speeches
every
big
fighter
here
has
made
a
speech
only
a
few
words
shouted
the
promoter
in
glendon
ear
but
giving
a
lecture
there
nothing
in
the
rules
against
lectures
glendon
answered
and
now
you
fellows
get
out
of
the
ring
or
i
throw
you
out
the
promoter
apoplectic
and
struggling
was
dropped
over
the
ropes
by
his
he
was
a
large
man
but
so
easily
had
glendon
done
it
with
one
hand
that
the
audience
went
wild
with
delight
the
cries
for
a
speech
increased
in
volume
stubener
and
the
owner
beat
a
wise
retreat
glendon
held
up
his
hands
to
be
heard
whereupon
those
that
shouted
for
the
fight
redoubled
their
efforts
two
or
three
tiers
of
seats
crashed
down
and
numbers
who
had
thus
lost
their
places
added
to
the
turmoil
by
making
a
concerted
rush
to
squeeze
in
on
the
still
intact
seats
while
those
behind
blocked
from
sight
of
the
ring
yelled
and
raved
for
them
to
sit
down
glendon
walked
to
the
ropes
and
spoke
to
the
police
captain
he
was
compelled
to
bend
over
and
shout
in
his
ear
if
i
do
give
this
speech
he
said
this
crowd
will
wreck
the
place
if
they
break
loose
you
can
never
hold
them
you
know
that
now
you
got
to
help
you
keep
the
ring
clear
and
i
silence
the
crowd
he
went
back
to
the
center
of
the
ring
and
again
held
up
his
hands
you
want
that
speech
he
shouted
in
a
tremendous
voice
hundreds
near
the
ring
heard
him
and
cried
yes
then
let
every
man
who
wants
to
hear
shut
up
the
next
to
him
the
advice
was
taken
so
that
when
he
repeated
it
his
voice
penetrated
farther
again
and
again
he
shouted
it
and
slowly
zone
by
zone
the
silence
pressed
outward
from
the
ring
accompanied
by
a
muffled
undertone
of
smacks
and
thuds
and
scuffles
as
the
obstreperous
were
subdued
by
their
neighbors
almost
had
all
confusion
been
smothered
when
a
tier
of
seats
near
the
ring
went
down
this
was
greeted
with
fresh
roars
of
laughter
which
of
itself
died
away
so
that
a
lone
voice
far
back
was
heard
distinctly
as
it
piped
go
on
glendon
we
with
you
glendon
had
the
celt
intuitive
knowledge
of
the
psychology
of
the
crowd
he
knew
that
what
had
been
a
vast
disorderly
mob
five
minutes
before
was
now
tightly
in
hand
and
for
added
effect
he
deliberately
delayed
yet
the
delay
was
just
long
enough
and
not
a
second
too
long
for
thirty
seconds
the
silence
was
complete
and
the
effect
produced
was
one
of
awe
then
just
as
the
first
faint
hints
of
restlessness
came
to
his
ears
he
began
to
speak
when
i
finish
this
speech
he
said
i
am
going
to
fight
i
promise
you
it
will
be
a
real
fight
one
of
the
few
real
fights
you
have
ever
seen
i
am
going
to
get
my
man
in
the
shortest
possible
time
billy
morgan
in
making
his
final
announcement
will
tell
you
that
it
is
to
be
a
contest
let
me
tell
you
that
it
will
be
nearer
seconds
when
i
was
interrupted
i
was
telling
you
that
the
ring
was
rotten
it
is
from
top
to
bottom
it
is
run
on
business
principles
and
you
all
know
what
business
principles
are
enough
said
you
are
the
suckers
every
last
one
of
you
that
is
not
making
anything
out
of
it
why
are
the
seats
falling
down
graft
like
the
fight
game
they
were
built
on
business
principles
he
now
held
the
audience
stronger
than
ever
and
knew
it
there
are
three
men
squeezed
on
two
seats
i
can
see
that
everywhere
what
does
it
mean
graft
the
stewards
do
get
any
wages
they
are
supposed
to
graft
business
principles
again
you
pay
of
course
you
pay
how
are
the
fight
permits
obtained
graft
and
now
let
me
ask
you
if
the
men
who
build
the
seats
graft
if
the
stewards
graft
if
the
authorities
graft
why
should
those
higher
up
in
the
fight
game
graft
they
do
and
you
pay
and
let
me
tell
you
it
is
not
the
fault
of
the
fighters
they
run
the
game
the
promoters
and
managers
run
it
they
the
business
men
the
fighters
are
only
fighters
they
begin
honestly
enough
but
the
managers
and
promoters
make
them
give
in
or
kick
them
out
there
have
been
straight
fighters
and
there
are
now
a
few
but
they
earn
much
as
a
rule
i
guess
there
have
been
straight
managers
mine
is
about
the
best
of
the
boiling
but
just
ask
him
how
much
he
got
salted
down
in
real
estate
and
apartment
houses
here
the
uproar
began
to
drown
his
voice
let
every
man
who
wants
to
hear
shut
up
the
man
alongside
of
him
glendon
instructed
again
like
the
murmur
of
a
surf
there
was
a
rustling
of
smacks
and
thuds
and
scuffles
and
the
house
quieted
down
why
does
every
fighter
work
overtime
insisting
that
he
always
fought
square
why
are
they
called
honest
johns
and
honest
bills
and
honest
blacksmiths
and
all
the
rest
does
it
ever
strike
you
that
they
seem
to
be
afraid
of
something
when
a
man
comes
to
you
shouting
he
is
honest
you
get
suspicious
but
when
a
passes
the
same
dope
out
to
you
you
swallow
it
down
may
the
best
man
win
how
often
have
you
heard
billy
morgan
say
that
let
me
tell
you
that
the
best
man
does
win
so
often
and
when
he
does
it
usually
arranged
for
him
most
of
the
grudge
fights
you
heard
or
seen
were
arranged
too
it
a
program
the
whole
thing
is
programmed
do
you
think
the
promoters
and
managers
are
in
it
for
their
health
they
not
they
business
men
tom
dick
and
harry
are
three
fighters
dick
is
the
best
man
in
two
fights
he
could
prove
it
but
what
happens
tom
licks
harry
dick
licks
tom
harry
licks
dick
nothing
proved
then
come
the
return
matches
harry
licks
tom
tom
licks
dick
dick
licks
harry
nothing
proved
then
they
try
again
dick
is
kicking
says
he
wants
to
get
along
in
the
game
so
dick
licks
tom
and
dick
licks
harry
eight
fights
to
prove
dick
the
best
man
when
two
could
have
done
it
all
arranged
a
regular
program
and
you
pay
for
it
and
when
your
seats
do
break
down
you
get
robbed
of
them
by
the
stewards
it
a
good
game
too
if
it
were
only
square
the
fighters
would
be
square
if
they
had
a
chance
but
the
graft
is
too
big
when
a
handful
of
men
can
divide
up
of
a
million
dollars
on
three
fights
a
wild
outburst
compelled
him
to
stop
out
of
the
medley
of
cries
from
all
over
the
house
he
could
distinguish
such
as
what
million
dollars
what
three
fights
tell
us
go
on
likewise
there
were
boos
and
hisses
and
cries
of
muckraker
muckraker
do
you
want
to
hear
glendon
shouted
then
keep
order
once
more
he
compelled
the
impressive
half
minute
of
silence
what
is
jim
hanford
planning
what
is
the
program
his
crowd
and
mine
are
framing
up
they
know
i
got
him
he
knows
i
got
him
i
can
whip
him
in
one
fight
but
he
the
champion
of
the
world
if
i
do
give
in
to
the
program
they
never
give
me
a
chance
to
fight
him
the
program
calls
for
three
fights
i
am
to
win
the
first
fight
it
will
be
pulled
off
in
nevada
if
san
francisco
wo
stand
for
it
we
are
to
make
it
a
good
fight
to
make
it
good
each
of
us
will
put
up
a
side
bet
of
twenty
thousand
it
will
be
real
money
but
it
wo
be
a
real
bet
each
gets
his
own
slipped
back
to
him
the
same
way
with
the
purse
we
divide
it
evenly
though
the
public
division
will
be
and
the
purse
the
moving
picture
royalties
the
advertisements
and
all
the
rest
of
the
drags
wo
be
a
cent
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
we
divide
it
and
go
to
work
on
the
return
match
hanford
will
win
that
and
we
divide
again
then
comes
the
third
fight
i
win
as
i
have
every
right
to
and
we
have
taken
of
a
million
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
fighting
public
that
the
program
but
the
money
is
dirty
and
that
why
i
am
quitting
the
ring
it
was
at
this
moment
that
jim
hanford
kicking
a
clinging
policeman
back
among
the
heaved
his
huge
frame
through
the
ropes
bellowing
it
a
lie
he
rushed
like
an
infuriated
bull
at
glendon
who
sprang
back
and
then
instead
of
meeting
the
rush
ducked
cleanly
away
unable
to
check
himself
the
big
man
fetched
up
against
the
ropes
flung
back
by
the
spring
of
them
he
was
turning
to
make
another
rush
when
glendon
landed
him
glendon
cool
distanced
his
man
perfectly
to
the
jaw
and
struck
the
first
blow
of
his
career
all
his
strength
and
his
reserve
of
strength
went
into
that
one
smashing
muscular
explosion
hanford
was
dead
in
the
air
in
so
far
as
unconsciousness
may
resemble
death
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
ceased
at
the
moment
of
contact
with
glendon
fist
his
feet
left
the
floor
and
he
was
in
the
air
until
he
struck
the
topmost
rope
his
inert
body
sprawled
across
it
sagged
at
the
middle
and
fell
through
the
ropes
and
down
out
of
the
ring
upon
the
heads
of
the
men
in
the
press
seats
the
audience
broke
loose
it
had
already
seen
more
than
it
had
paid
to
see
for
the
great
jim
hanford
the
world
champion
had
been
knocked
out
it
was
unofficial
but
it
had
been
with
a
single
punch
never
had
there
been
such
a
night
in
fistiana
glendon
looked
ruefully
at
his
damaged
knuckles
cast
a
glance
through
the
ropes
to
where
hanford
was
groggily
coming
to
and
held
up
his
hands
he
had
clinched
his
right
to
be
heard
and
the
audience
grew
still
when
i
began
to
fight
he
said
they
called
me
glendon
you
saw
that
punch
a
moment
ago
i
always
had
that
punch
i
went
after
my
men
and
got
them
on
the
jump
though
i
was
careful
not
to
hit
with
all
my
might
then
i
was
educated
my
manager
told
me
it
was
fair
to
the
crowd
he
advised
me
to
make
long
fights
so
that
the
crowd
could
get
a
run
for
its
money
i
was
a
fool
a
mutt
i
was
a
green
lad
from
the
mountains
so
help
me
god
i
swallowed
it
as
the
truth
my
manager
used
to
talk
over
with
me
what
round
i
would
put
my
man
out
in
then
he
tipped
it
off
to
the
betting
syndicate
and
the
betting
syndicate
went
to
it
of
course
you
paid
but
i
am
glad
for
one
thing
i
never
touched
a
cent
of
the
money
they
dare
offer
it
to
me
because
they
knew
it
would
give
the
game
away
you
remember
my
fight
with
nat
powers
i
never
knocked
him
out
i
had
got
suspicious
so
the
gang
framed
it
up
with
him
i
did
know
i
intended
to
let
him
go
a
couple
of
rounds
over
the
sixteenth
that
last
punch
in
the
sixteenth
did
shake
him
but
he
faked
the
just
the
same
and
fooled
all
of
you
how
about
a
voice
called
out
is
it
a
it
is
was
glendon
answer
how
the
syndicate
betting
that
cannam
will
last
to
the
fourteenth
howls
and
hoots
went
up
for
the
last
time
glendon
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
i
almost
done
now
but
i
want
to
tell
you
one
thing
the
syndicate
gets
landed
this
is
to
be
a
square
fight
tom
cannam
last
till
the
fourteenth
round
he
wo
last
the
first
round
cannam
sprang
to
his
feet
in
his
corner
and
cried
out
in
a
fury
you
ca
do
it
the
man
do
live
who
can
get
me
in
one
round
glendon
ignored
him
and
went
on
once
now
in
my
life
i
have
struck
with
all
my
strength
you
saw
that
a
moment
ago
when
i
caught
hanford
for
the
second
time
i
am
going
to
hit
with
all
my
strength
that
is
if
cannam
jump
through
the
ropes
right
now
and
get
away
and
now
i
ready
he
went
to
his
corner
and
held
out
his
hands
for
his
gloves
in
the
opposite
corner
cannam
raged
while
his
seconds
tried
vainly
to
calm
him
at
last
billy
morgan
managed
to
make
the
final
announcement
this
will
be
a
round
contest
he
shouted
marquis
of
queensbury
rules
and
may
the
best
man
win
let
her
go
the
gong
struck
the
two
men
advanced
glendon
right
hand
was
extended
for
the
customary
shake
but
cannam
with
an
angry
toss
of
the
head
refused
to
take
it
to
the
general
surprise
he
did
not
rush
angry
though
he
was
he
fought
carefully
his
touched
pride
impelling
him
to
bend
every
effort
to
last
out
the
round
several
times
he
struck
but
he
struck
cautiously
never
relaxing
his
defense
glendon
hunted
him
about
the
ring
ever
advancing
with
the
remorseless
of
his
left
foot
yet
he
struck
no
blows
nor
attempted
to
strike
he
even
dropped
his
hands
to
his
sides
and
hunted
the
other
defenselessly
in
an
effort
to
draw
him
out
cannam
grinned
defiantly
but
declined
to
take
advantage
of
the
proffered
opening
two
minutes
passed
and
then
a
change
came
over
glendon
by
every
muscle
by
every
line
of
his
face
he
advertised
that
the
moment
had
come
for
him
to
get
his
man
acting
it
was
and
it
was
well
acted
he
seemed
to
have
become
a
thing
of
steel
as
hard
and
pitiless
as
steel
the
effect
was
apparent
on
cannam
who
redoubled
his
caution
glendon
quickly
worked
him
into
a
corner
and
herded
and
held
him
there
still
he
struck
no
blow
nor
attempted
to
strike
and
the
suspense
on
cannam
part
grew
painful
in
vain
he
tried
to
work
out
of
the
corner
while
he
could
not
summon
resolution
to
rush
upon
his
opponent
in
an
attempt
to
gain
the
respite
of
a
clinch
then
it
came
a
swift
series
of
simple
feints
that
were
muscle
flashes
cannam
was
dazzled
so
was
the
audience
no
two
of
the
onlookers
could
agree
afterward
as
to
what
took
place
cannam
ducked
one
feint
and
at
the
same
time
threw
up
his
face
guard
to
meet
another
feint
for
his
jaw
he
also
attempted
to
change
position
with
his
legs
witnesses
swore
that
they
saw
glendon
start
the
blow
from
his
right
hip
and
leap
forward
like
a
tiger
to
add
the
weight
of
his
body
to
it
be
that
as
it
may
the
blow
caught
cannam
on
the
point
of
the
chin
at
the
moment
of
his
shift
of
position
and
like
hanford
he
was
unconscious
in
the
air
before
he
struck
the
ropes
and
fell
through
on
the
heads
of
the
reporters
of
what
happened
afterward
that
night
in
the
golden
gate
arena
columns
in
the
newspapers
were
unable
adequately
to
describe
the
police
kept
the
ring
clear
but
they
could
not
save
the
arena
it
was
not
a
riot
it
was
an
orgy
not
a
seat
was
left
standing
all
over
the
great
hall
by
main
strength
crowding
and
jostling
to
lay
hands
on
beams
and
boards
the
crowd
uprooted
and
sought
protection
of
the
police
but
there
were
not
enough
police
to
escort
them
out
and
fighters
managers
and
promoters
were
beaten
and
battered
jim
hanford
alone
was
spared
his
jaw
prodigiously
swollen
earned
him
this
mercy
outside
when
finally
driven
from
the
building
the
crowd
fell
upon
a
new
motor
car
belonging
to
a
fight
promoter
and
reduced
it
to
scrapiron
and
kindling
wood
glendon
unable
to
dress
amid
the
wreckage
of
dressing
rooms
gained
his
automobile
still
in
his
ring
costume
and
wrapped
in
a
bath
robe
but
failed
to
escape
by
weight
of
numbers
the
crowd
caught
and
held
his
machine
the
police
were
too
busy
to
rescue
him
and
in
the
end
a
compromise
was
effected
whereby
the
car
was
permitted
to
proceed
at
a
walk
escorted
by
five
thousand
cheering
madmen
it
was
midnight
when
this
storm
swept
past
union
square
and
down
upon
the
francis
cries
for
a
speech
went
up
and
though
at
the
hotel
entrance
glendon
was
restrained
from
escaping
he
even
tried
leaping
out
upon
the
heads
of
the
enthusiasts
but
his
feet
never
touched
the
pavement
on
heads
and
shoulders
clutched
at
and
uplifted
by
every
hand
that
could
touch
his
body
he
went
back
through
the
air
to
the
machine
then
he
gave
his
speech
and
maud
glendon
looking
down
from
an
upper
window
at
her
young
hercules
towering
on
the
seat
of
the
automobile
knew
as
she
always
knew
that
he
meant
it
when
he
repeated
that
he
had
fought
his
last
fight
and
retired
from
the
ring
forever
the
end
