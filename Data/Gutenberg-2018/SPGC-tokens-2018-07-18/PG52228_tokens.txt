the
sky
decay
ross
stood
on
the
traders
ramp
overlooking
the
yards
and
the
word
kept
bobbing
to
the
top
of
his
mind
decay
about
all
of
halsey
s
planet
there
was
the
imperceptible
reek
of
decay
the
clean
big
bustling
efficient
spaceport
only
made
the
sensation
stronger
from
where
he
stood
on
the
height
of
the
ramp
he
could
see
the
yards
the
spires
of
halsey
city
ten
kilometers
the
gray
acres
of
ghost
town
between
ross
wrinkled
his
nose
he
wasn
t
a
man
given
to
brooding
but
the
scent
of
decay
had
saturated
his
nostrils
that
morning
he
had
tossed
and
turned
all
the
night
wrestling
with
a
decision
and
he
had
got
up
early
so
early
that
the
only
thing
that
made
sense
was
to
walk
to
work
and
that
meant
walking
through
ghost
town
he
hadn
t
done
that
in
a
long
time
not
since
childhood
ghost
town
was
a
wonderful
place
to
play
tag
follow
my
fuehrer
senators
and
president
the
ancient
games
took
on
new
life
when
you
could
dodge
and
turn
among
crumbling
ruins
dart
down
unmarked
lanes
gallop
through
sagging
shacks
where
you
might
stir
out
a
screeching
unexpected
recluse
but
it
was
clear
the
fifteen
years
between
childhood
games
and
a
troubled
man
s
walk
to
town
had
grown
everybody
knew
that
ask
the
right
specialists
and
they
d
tell
you
how
much
and
how
fast
an
acre
a
year
a
street
a
month
a
block
a
week
the
specialists
would
twinkle
at
you
convinced
that
the
acre
street
block
was
under
control
since
they
could
measure
it
ask
the
right
specialists
and
they
would
tell
you
why
it
was
happening
one
answer
per
specialist
with
an
ironclad
guarantee
that
there
would
be
no
overlapping
of
replies
a
purely
psychological
phenomenon
ross
a
vibration
of
the
pendulum
toward
greater
municipal
compactness
a
huddling
a
mature
recognition
of
the
facts
of
interdependence
basically
a
step
forward
a
purely
biological
phenomenon
ross
falling
birth
rate
due
to
biochemical
deficiency
of
trace
elements
processed
out
of
our
planetary
diet
fortunately
the
situation
has
been
recognized
in
time
and
my
bill
before
the
chamber
will
provide
a
purely
technological
problem
ross
maintenance
of
a
sprawling
city
is
inevitably
less
efficient
than
that
of
a
compact
unit
inevitably
there
has
been
a
drift
back
to
the
central
areas
and
the
convenience
of
walkways
winterized
plazas
yes
it
was
a
purely
problem
and
it
was
basically
a
step
forward
ross
wondered
how
many
ghost
towns
lay
corpselike
on
the
surface
of
halsey
s
planet
decay
he
thought
decay
but
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
problem
the
problem
that
had
kept
him
awake
all
the
night
the
problem
that
blighted
the
view
before
him
now
the
trading
bell
clanged
the
day
s
work
began
for
ross
it
might
be
his
last
day
s
work
at
the
yards
he
walked
slowly
from
the
ramp
to
the
offices
of
the
oldham
trading
corporation
morning
ross
boy
his
breezy
young
boss
greeted
him
charles
oldham
iv
s
father
had
always
taken
a
paternal
attitude
toward
his
help
and
charles
oldham
iv
was
not
going
to
change
anything
that
daddy
had
done
he
shook
ross
s
hand
at
the
door
of
the
suite
and
apologized
because
they
hadn
t
been
able
to
find
a
new
secretary
for
him
yet
they
d
been
looking
for
two
weeks
but
the
three
applicants
they
had
been
able
to
dredge
up
had
all
been
hopeless
it
s
the
damn
chamber
said
charles
oldham
iv
winsomely
gesturing
with
his
hands
to
show
how
helpless
men
of
affairs
were
against
the
blundering
interference
of
government
damn
labor
shortage
is
nothing
but
a
damn
artificial
scarcity
crisis
daddy
saw
it
he
knew
it
was
ross
almost
told
him
he
was
quitting
but
held
back
maybe
it
was
because
he
didn
t
want
to
spoil
oldham
s
day
with
bad
news
right
on
top
of
the
opening
bell
or
maybe
it
was
because
in
spite
of
a
sleepless
night
he
still
wasn
t
quite
sure
the
morning
s
work
helped
him
to
become
sure
it
was
the
same
monotonous
grind
three
freighters
had
arrived
at
dawn
from
halsey
s
third
moon
but
none
of
them
was
any
affair
of
his
there
was
an
export
shipment
of
jewelry
and
watches
to
be
attended
to
but
the
ship
was
not
to
take
off
for
another
week
it
scarcely
classified
as
urgent
ross
worked
on
the
manifests
for
a
couple
of
hours
stared
through
his
window
for
an
hour
and
then
it
was
time
for
lunch
little
marconi
hailed
him
as
he
passed
through
the
traders
lounge
of
all
the
juniors
on
the
exchange
marconi
was
the
one
ross
found
easiest
to
take
he
was
lean
and
dark
where
ross
was
solid
and
fair
worse
he
stood
four
ranks
above
ross
in
seniority
but
since
ross
worked
for
oldham
and
marconi
worked
for
haarland
s
the
difference
could
be
waived
in
social
intercourse
ross
suspected
that
to
marconi
as
to
him
trading
was
only
a
dull
one
and
not
a
crusade
and
he
knew
that
marconi
s
reading
was
not
confined
to
bills
of
lading
lunch
asked
marconi
sure
ross
said
and
he
knew
he
d
probably
spill
his
secret
to
the
little
man
from
haarland
s
the
skyroom
was
all
eight
of
the
usual
tables
were
taken
they
pushed
on
into
the
area
by
the
windows
and
found
a
table
overlooking
the
yards
marconi
blew
dust
off
his
chair
been
a
long
time
since
this
was
used
he
grumbled
drink
he
raised
his
eyebrows
when
ross
nodded
it
made
a
break
marconi
was
the
one
usually
who
had
a
drink
with
lunch
ross
never
touched
it
when
the
drinks
came
each
of
them
said
to
the
other
in
perfect
synchronism
i
ve
got
something
to
tell
they
looked
laughed
go
ahead
said
ross
the
little
man
didn
t
even
argue
rapturously
he
drew
a
photo
out
of
his
pocket
god
thought
ross
wearily
lurline
again
he
studied
the
picture
with
a
show
of
interest
new
snap
he
asked
brightly
lovely
then
he
noticed
the
inscription
my
fiance
with
crates
of
well
he
said
fiance
is
it
congratulations
marconi
marconi
was
almost
drooling
on
the
photo
next
month
he
said
happily
a
big
big
wedding
for
keeps
keeps
with
children
ross
made
an
expression
of
polite
surprise
you
don
t
say
he
said
it
s
all
down
in
black
and
white
she
agrees
to
have
two
children
in
the
first
five
permissive
clause
a
straight
guarantee
fifteen
hundred
annual
allowance
per
child
and
ross
do
you
know
what
her
lawyer
told
her
right
in
front
of
me
that
she
ought
to
ask
for
three
thousand
and
she
told
him
no
turek
i
happen
to
be
in
how
do
you
like
that
ross
a
girl
in
a
million
ross
said
feebly
his
private
thoughts
were
that
marconi
had
been
gaffed
and
netted
like
a
sugar
perch
lurline
was
of
the
old
landowners
who
didn
t
own
anything
much
but
land
these
days
and
marconi
was
an
undersized
nobody
who
happened
to
make
a
very
good
living
sure
she
happened
to
be
in
love
smartest
thing
she
could
be
of
course
promising
to
have
children
sounded
pretty
special
but
the
papers
were
full
of
those
things
every
day
marconi
could
reliably
be
counted
on
to
hang
himself
he
d
promise
her
breakfast
in
bed
every
third
week
end
or
the
maid
that
he
couldn
t
possibly
find
on
the
labor
market
and
the
courts
would
throw
all
the
promises
on
both
sides
out
of
the
contract
as
a
matter
of
simple
equity
but
the
marriage
would
stick
all
right
marconi
had
himself
a
final
moist
fatuous
sigh
and
returned
the
photo
to
his
pocket
and
now
he
asked
brightly
craning
his
neck
for
the
waiter
what
s
your
news
ross
sipped
his
drink
staring
out
at
the
nuzzling
freighters
in
their
hemispherical
slips
he
said
abruptly
i
might
be
on
one
of
those
next
week
fallon
s
got
a
purser
s
berth
marconi
forgot
the
waiter
and
gaped
quitting
i
ve
got
to
do
something
ross
exploded
his
own
voice
scared
him
there
was
a
knife
blade
of
hysteria
in
the
sound
of
it
he
gripped
the
edge
of
the
table
and
forced
himself
to
be
calm
and
deliberate
marconi
said
tardily
easy
easy
you
ve
said
it
marconi
everything
s
so
damned
easy
and
so
damned
boring
that
i
m
just
about
ready
to
blow
i
ve
got
to
do
something
he
repeated
i
m
getting
nowhere
i
push
papers
around
and
then
i
push
them
back
again
you
know
what
happens
next
you
get
soft
and
paunchy
you
find
yourself
going
by
the
book
instead
of
by
your
head
you
re
covered
if
you
go
by
the
matter
what
happens
and
you
might
just
as
well
be
dead
now
now
hell
ross
flared
marconi
i
swear
i
think
there
s
something
wrong
with
me
look
take
ghost
town
for
instance
ever
wonder
why
nobody
lives
there
except
a
couple
of
crazy
old
hermits
why
it
s
ghost
town
marconi
explained
it
s
and
why
is
it
deserted
what
happened
to
the
people
who
used
to
live
there
marconi
shook
his
head
you
need
a
vacation
son
he
said
sympathetically
that
was
a
long
time
ago
hundreds
of
years
but
where
did
the
people
go
ross
persisted
desperately
all
of
the
city
was
inhabited
hundreds
of
years
city
was
twice
as
big
as
it
is
now
how
come
marconi
shrugged
ross
collapsed
don
t
know
you
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
nobody
knows
only
thing
is
i
care
i
m
curious
marconi
i
moody
depressed
i
get
to
worrying
about
crazy
things
ghost
town
for
one
and
why
can
t
they
find
a
secretary
for
me
and
am
i
really
different
from
everybody
else
or
do
i
just
think
doesn
t
that
mean
that
i
m
insane
he
laughed
marconi
said
warmly
ross
you
aren
t
the
only
one
don
t
ever
think
you
are
i
went
through
it
myself
found
the
answer
too
you
wait
he
paused
ross
said
suspiciously
yeah
marconi
tapped
the
breast
pocket
with
the
photo
of
lurline
she
ll
come
along
he
said
ross
managed
not
to
sneer
in
his
face
no
he
said
wearily
look
i
don
t
advertise
it
but
i
was
married
once
i
was
eighteen
it
lasted
for
a
year
and
i
m
the
one
who
walked
out
settlement
it
took
me
five
years
to
pay
off
the
loan
but
i
never
regretted
marconi
began
gravely
sexual
ross
cut
him
off
with
an
impatient
gesture
in
that
department
he
said
it
so
happens
she
was
a
genius
but
ross
shrugged
i
must
have
been
crazy
he
said
shortly
i
kept
thinking
that
she
was
dying
on
the
vine
like
the
rest
of
halsey
s
planet
and
i
must
still
be
crazy
because
i
still
think
the
little
man
involuntarily
felt
his
breast
pocket
he
said
gently
maybe
you
ve
been
working
too
too
hard
ross
laughed
a
curious
blend
of
true
humor
and
well
he
admitted
i
need
a
change
anyhow
i
might
as
well
be
on
a
longliner
at
least
i
d
have
my
spree
to
look
back
no
marconi
said
so
violently
that
ross
slopped
the
drink
he
was
lifting
to
his
mouth
ross
looked
hard
at
the
little
and
speculatively
no
then
he
said
it
was
just
a
figure
of
speech
of
course
but
tell
me
something
won
t
you
marconi
tell
you
what
tell
me
why
such
a
violent
reaction
to
the
word
i
want
to
hell
ross
the
little
man
grumbled
you
know
what
a
longliner
is
for
crews
nothing
for
a
man
like
i
want
to
know
more
ross
insisted
when
i
ask
you
what
a
longliner
is
what
the
crew
do
with
themselves
for
two
or
three
centuries
you
change
the
subject
you
always
change
the
subject
maybe
you
know
something
i
don
t
know
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
and
this
time
the
subject
doesn
t
get
changed
you
don
t
get
off
the
hook
until
i
find
he
took
a
sip
of
his
drink
and
leaned
back
tell
me
about
longliners
he
said
i
ve
never
seen
one
coming
in
it
s
been
fifteen
years
or
so
since
that
bucket
from
sirius
iv
hasn
t
it
but
you
were
on
the
job
marconi
was
no
longer
a
man
in
love
or
one
of
the
few
people
whom
ross
considered
to
be
wholly
him
he
was
a
little
stranger
with
a
stubborn
mouth
and
an
ingratiating
veneer
in
short
he
was
again
a
trader
and
a
good
one
i
ll
tell
you
anything
i
know
marconi
declared
positively
and
insincerely
tend
to
that
fellow
first
though
will
you
he
pointed
to
a
uniformed
yards
messenger
whose
eye
had
just
alighted
on
ross
the
man
threaded
his
way
stumbling
through
the
tables
and
laid
a
sealed
envelope
down
in
the
puddle
left
by
ross
s
drink
sorry
sir
he
said
crisply
wiped
off
the
envelope
with
his
handkerchief
and
for
lagniappe
wiped
the
puddle
off
the
table
into
ross
s
lap
speechless
ross
signed
for
the
envelope
on
a
slip
marked
urgent
priority
rush
the
messenger
saluted
almost
putting
his
own
eye
out
and
left
crashing
into
tables
and
chairs
ross
muttered
following
him
with
his
eyes
how
the
devil
do
they
stay
alive
at
all
marconi
said
unsmiling
you
re
taking
this
kick
pretty
seriously
ross
i
admit
he
s
a
little
clumsy
but
nothing
said
ross
don
t
try
to
tell
me
you
don
t
know
something
s
wrong
marconi
he
s
a
bumbling
incompetent
and
half
his
generation
is
just
like
he
looked
bitterly
at
the
envelope
and
dropped
it
on
the
table
again
more
manifests
he
said
i
swear
i
ll
start
throwing
tableware
if
i
have
to
check
another
bill
of
lading
brighten
my
day
marconi
tell
me
about
the
longliners
you
re
not
off
the
hook
yet
you
marconi
signaled
for
another
drink
all
right
he
said
marconi
tells
all
about
longliners
they
re
ships
they
go
from
the
planet
of
one
star
to
the
planet
of
another
star
it
takes
a
long
time
because
stars
are
many
apart
and
rocket
ships
can
not
travel
as
fast
as
light
einstein
said
he
was
do
we
start
with
the
sirius
iv
ship
i
was
around
when
it
came
in
all
right
fifteen
years
ago
and
halsey
s
planet
is
still
enjoying
the
benefits
of
it
and
so
is
leverett
and
sons
trading
corporation
they
did
fine
on
flowers
from
seeds
that
bucket
brought
they
did
fine
on
sugar
perch
from
eggs
that
bucket
brought
i
ve
never
had
it
myself
raw
fish
for
dessert
but
some
people
swear
by
five
shields
a
portion
they
can
have
the
hook
marconi
ross
reminded
grimly
trader
marconi
laughed
amiably
sorry
well
what
else
pictures
and
music
but
i
m
not
much
on
them
i
do
read
though
and
as
a
reader
i
say
god
bless
that
bucket
from
sirius
iv
we
never
had
a
novelist
like
morris
halliday
on
this
an
essayist
like
jay
waring
let
s
see
there
have
been
eight
halliday
novels
off
the
microfilms
so
far
and
i
think
leverett
still
has
a
couple
in
the
vaults
leverett
must
marconi
i
don
t
want
to
hear
about
leverett
and
sons
or
morris
halliday
or
waring
i
want
to
hear
about
i
m
trying
to
tell
you
marconi
said
sullenly
the
mask
down
no
you
re
not
you
re
telling
me
that
the
longline
ships
go
from
one
stellar
system
to
another
with
merchandise
i
know
then
what
do
you
want
don
t
be
difficult
marconi
i
want
to
know
the
facts
all
about
longliners
the
big
the
candid
explanations
that
explain
that
a
starship
is
a
starship
i
know
that
they
re
multigeneration
jobs
a
group
of
people
get
in
on
sirius
iv
and
their
come
giggling
and
stumbling
out
on
halsey
s
planet
i
know
that
every
couple
of
generations
your
mine
for
that
one
with
profits
that
would
be
taxed
off
anyway
and
slings
it
out
stocked
with
seeds
and
film
and
sound
tape
and
patent
designs
and
manufacturing
specifications
for
every
new
gimmick
on
the
market
in
the
hope
that
it
ll
be
back
long
after
we
re
dead
with
a
similar
cargo
to
enrich
your
firm
s
and
my
firm
s
owners
sounds
as
i
say
it
s
tax
money
anyhow
i
know
that
your
firm
and
mine
staff
the
ships
with
half
a
dozen
bums
of
each
sex
who
are
loaded
aboard
with
a
dandy
case
of
delirium
tremens
contracted
from
spending
their
bounty
money
the
only
way
they
know
how
and
that
s
just
about
all
i
know
take
it
from
there
marconi
and
be
the
little
man
shrugged
irritably
that
gag
s
beginning
to
wear
thin
ross
he
complained
what
do
you
want
me
to
tell
number
of
welds
in
bulkhead
of
starship
what
s
the
difference
as
you
said
a
starship
is
a
starship
is
a
longliner
without
them
the
inhabited
solar
systems
would
have
no
means
of
contact
or
commerce
what
else
is
there
to
say
ross
looked
suddenly
lost
t
know
he
said
don
t
you
know
marconi
marconi
hesitated
and
for
a
moment
ross
was
sure
he
did
something
at
any
rate
something
that
might
be
an
answer
to
the
doubts
and
nagging
inconsistencies
that
were
bothering
him
but
then
marconi
shrugged
and
looked
at
his
watch
and
ordered
another
drink
but
there
was
something
wrong
ross
felt
himself
in
the
position
of
a
diagnostician
whose
patient
willfully
refuses
to
tell
where
it
hurts
the
planet
was
wouldn
t
admit
it
sick
dying
maybe
he
was
on
the
wrong
track
entirely
maybe
the
starships
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
maybe
there
was
nothing
that
marconi
knew
that
would
fit
a
piece
into
the
puzzle
and
make
the
answer
come
out
all
ghost
town
continued
to
grow
acre
by
acre
year
by
year
and
oldham
still
hadn
t
found
him
a
secretary
capable
of
writing
her
own
name
according
to
the
historians
everything
fits
nicely
into
place
ross
said
dubiously
they
say
we
came
here
ourselves
in
longliners
once
marconi
our
ancestors
under
some
man
named
halsey
colonized
this
place
fourteen
hundred
years
ago
according
to
the
longliners
that
come
in
from
other
stars
their
ancestors
colonized
wherever
they
came
from
in
starships
from
a
place
called
earth
where
is
this
earth
marconi
marconi
said
succinctly
look
in
the
star
charts
it
s
yes
but
hell
marconi
said
in
annoyance
what
in
the
world
has
got
into
you
ross
earth
is
a
planet
like
any
other
planet
the
starship
halsey
colonized
in
was
a
starship
like
any
other
bigger
i
guess
that
wasn
t
there
after
all
what
are
the
longliners
but
colonists
they
happen
to
be
going
to
planets
that
are
already
inhabited
that
s
all
so
a
starship
is
nothing
new
or
even
very
interesting
and
this
is
beginning
to
bore
me
and
you
ought
to
read
your
ross
felt
that
that
was
just
how
trader
marconi
wanted
him
to
feel
he
said
slowly
i
m
sorry
if
i
m
being
a
nuisance
marconi
you
know
how
it
is
when
you
feel
stale
and
restless
i
know
all
the
it
s
so
damned
hard
to
believe
them
the
famous
colonizing
ships
they
must
have
been
absolutely
gigantic
to
take
any
reasonable
number
of
people
on
a
multigeneration
ride
we
can
t
build
them
that
big
now
no
reason
but
we
couldn
t
if
we
had
to
imagine
shooting
those
things
all
over
the
galaxy
how
many
inhabited
planets
in
the
hundred
a
thousand
think
of
the
technology
marconi
what
became
of
it
we
don
t
need
that
sort
of
technology
any
more
marconi
explained
that
job
is
done
now
we
concentrate
on
more
important
things
learning
to
live
with
each
other
developing
our
own
planet
increasing
our
understanding
of
social
factors
and
ross
was
laughing
at
last
well
marconi
he
said
at
last
that
takes
care
of
that
we
sure
have
figured
out
how
to
handle
the
social
factors
all
right
every
year
there
are
fewer
of
them
to
handle
pretty
soon
we
ll
all
be
dead
and
then
the
problem
can
be
marked
marconi
laughed
as
if
he
d
been
waiting
for
the
chance
he
said
now
that
that
s
settled
are
you
going
to
open
your
message
are
you
at
least
going
to
have
some
lunch
the
yards
messenger
stumbled
up
to
their
table
again
this
time
with
an
envelope
for
marconi
he
looked
sharply
at
ross
s
unopened
envelope
and
said
nothing
pointedly
ross
guiltily
picked
it
up
and
tore
it
open
you
could
act
like
a
sulky
child
in
front
of
a
friend
but
strangers
didn
t
understand
the
message
was
from
his
office
radar
reports
high
velocity
spacecraft
on
autocontrols
first
approximation
trajectory
indicates
interstellar
origin
probable
eta
yards
no
radio
messages
received
don
t
have
to
tell
you
to
get
on
this
immediately
and
give
it
your
best
oldham
ross
looked
at
marconi
whose
expression
was
perturbed
bet
i
know
what
your
message
says
he
offered
with
an
uneasy
quaver
in
his
voice
marconi
said
i
ll
bet
you
do
oldham
s
radar
setup
on
sunward
always
has
been
better
than
haarland
s
better
location
man
you
are
in
trouble
let
s
get
out
there
and
hope
nobody
s
missed
you
so
they
grabbed
sandwiches
from
the
snack
bar
on
the
way
out
and
munched
them
while
the
yards
jeep
took
them
to
the
ready
line
skirting
the
freighters
in
their
pits
slipping
past
the
enormous
overhaul
sheds
they
saw
excited
debates
going
on
twice
they
were
passed
by
yards
vehicles
heading
toward
the
landing
area
halfway
to
the
line
they
heard
the
recall
sirens
warning
everybody
and
everything
out
of
the
ten
seared
acres
surrounded
by
homing
and
approach
radars
that
was
where
the
big
ones
were
landed
the
ready
line
was
jammed
when
they
got
there
ships
from
one
or
another
of
the
five
moons
that
circled
halsey
s
planet
were
common
the
moons
were
the
mines
even
the
weekly
liner
and
freighters
from
the
colony
on
sunward
the
planet
next
in
from
halsey
s
were
routine
to
the
yards
workers
but
to
anybody
an
interstellar
ship
was
a
sensation
a
thrill
protocols
were
uncertain
traders
argued
about
the
first
crack
at
the
strangers
and
their
goods
a
dealer
named
aalborg
said
the
only
fair
system
would
be
to
give
every
trade
there
an
equal
opportunity
to
do
alphabetical
order
everybody
agreed
that
under
no
circumstances
should
the
man
from
leverett
and
sons
be
allowed
to
except
the
man
from
leverett
and
sons
he
pointed
out
that
his
firm
was
the
logical
choice
because
it
had
more
and
fresher
experience
in
handling
interstellar
goods
than
any
other
they
almost
mobbed
him
it
wasn
t
merely
money
that
filled
the
atmosphere
with
electric
tingles
the
glamor
of
was
on
them
the
crew
aboard
that
ship
were
travelers
of
time
as
well
as
space
the
crew
that
had
launched
the
ship
was
dust
the
crew
that
served
it
now
had
never
seen
a
planet
there
was
even
some
humility
in
the
crowd
there
were
thoughtful
ones
among
them
who
reflected
that
it
was
not
after
all
a
very
great
feat
to
hitch
a
rocket
to
a
shell
and
lob
it
across
a
few
million
miles
to
a
neighboring
planet
it
was
eclipsed
by
the
tremendous
deed
whose
climax
they
were
about
to
witness
the
thoughtful
ones
shrugged
and
sighed
as
they
thought
that
even
the
starship
booming
down
toward
halsey
s
with
the
cleverest
air
replenishers
and
the
most
miraculously
efficient
waste
only
a
counter
in
the
game
whose
great
rule
was
the
formulation
of
the
legendary
einstein
that
there
is
no
way
to
push
a
material
object
past
the
speed
of
light
a
report
swept
the
field
that
left
men
reeling
in
its
wake
radar
track
confirmed
that
the
ship
was
of
unfamiliar
pattern
all
hope
that
it
might
be
a
starship
launched
from
this
very
spot
on
the
last
leg
of
a
stupefying
round
trip
was
officially
dead
the
starship
was
foreign
wonder
what
they
have
marconi
muttered
trader
ross
sneered
ponderously
he
was
feeling
better
the
weight
of
depression
had
been
lifted
for
the
time
being
either
by
his
confession
or
the
electric
atmosphere
if
every
day
were
like
this
he
thought
vaguely
let
s
not
kid
each
other
marconi
was
saying
exuberantly
this
is
an
event
man
where
are
they
from
what
are
they
peddling
do
i
get
a
good
cut
at
their
wares
it
could
be
fifty
thousand
shields
for
me
in
commission
alone
lurline
and
i
could
build
a
tower
house
on
great
blue
lake
with
that
kind
of
money
with
a
whole
floor
for
her
parents
ross
you
just
don
t
know
what
it
is
to
really
be
in
love
everything
a
jeep
roared
up
and
slammed
to
a
stop
ross
blinked
and
yelled
here
it
comes
they
watched
the
approach
with
the
interest
of
semiprofessionals
and
concealed
their
rising
excitement
with
shop
talk
whups
there
goes
the
job
into
marconi
pointed
as
a
huge
dish
antenna
swiveled
ponderously
on
its
mast
seems
the
dishes
can
t
handle
maybe
the
dish
can
t
either
she
might
be
just
plain
standard
sealed
gca
doesn
t
get
shot
my
young
friend
not
in
a
tank
it
doesn
maybe
along
about
the
fifth
generation
they
forgot
what
it
was
and
cut
it
open
with
an
acetylene
torch
to
see
what
was
bad
luck
for
us
in
that
case
the
ship
steadied
on
a
course
and
flashed
across
the
heavens
and
over
the
horizon
somebody
decided
a
braking
ellipse
or
two
was
in
order
what
about
line
of
sight
no
sweat
the
gca
i
d
bet
it
s
delafield
a
button
that
hooks
him
into
the
dish
at
every
rocket
field
on
halsey
s
it
s
been
all
thought
out
there
s
a
potential
fortune
aboard
that
longliner
and
fields
administration
wants
its
percentage
for
servicing
and
wonder
what
they
have
i
already
asked
that
one
so
you
they
lapsed
into
silence
until
the
rocket
boomed
in
again
from
the
east
high
and
slow
the
big
dish
swiveled
abruptly
and
began
tracking
again
he
ll
try
to
bring
her
down
this
time
yes
there
go
fore
and
stabilizing
flame
jutted
from
the
silvery
speck
high
in
the
blue
its
apparent
speed
slowed
to
a
crawl
it
vanished
for
a
second
as
steering
jets
turned
her
slowly
endwise
they
caught
sight
of
the
stern
jets
when
they
blasted
for
the
descent
it
was
the
landing
of
a
very
very
big
rocket
when
a
landing
is
successful
it
is
like
every
other
successful
landing
ever
made
but
the
action
that
the
field
whirled
into
immediately
following
the
landing
was
far
from
routine
the
bullhorns
roared
that
all
traders
wipers
rubbernecks
and
visitors
were
to
get
behind
the
ready
lines
and
stay
there
all
field
personnel
were
to
take
stations
for
longliner
clearance
the
weapons
and
decontamination
parties
were
to
take
their
stations
immediately
captain
delafield
would
issue
all
future
orders
and
don
t
let
any
of
the
traders
talk
you
out
of
it
men
captain
delafield
would
issue
all
future
orders
ross
watched
in
considerable
surprise
as
field
men
working
with
drilled
precision
broke
out
half
a
dozen
sleek
guns
from
an
bay
of
the
warehouse
and
manhandled
them
into
position
from
another
bay
a
large
pressure
tank
was
hauled
and
backed
against
the
lock
of
the
starship
ross
could
see
the
station
medic
bustlingly
supervise
that
and
the
hosing
of
white
gunk
onto
the
juncture
between
tank
and
ship
delafield
crossed
the
stretch
from
the
gca
complex
to
the
tank
vanished
into
it
through
a
door
and
that
was
that
the
tank
had
no
windows
ross
said
to
marconi
wonderingly
what
s
all
this
about
there
was
doc
gibbons
handling
the
pressure
tank
there
was
chunk
blaney
rolling
out
a
cannon
i
never
knew
was
many
more
little
secrets
are
there
that
i
don
t
know
about
marconi
grinned
they
have
gun
drill
once
a
month
my
young
friend
and
they
never
say
a
word
about
it
let
the
right
get
hold
of
the
story
and
he
might
sail
into
office
on
a
platform
of
keep
the
monsters
off
of
halsey
s
you
have
to
have
reasonable
precautions
military
and
medical
this
is
the
straight
s
never
been
any
trouble
of
either
the
conversation
died
and
there
was
a
long
boring
hour
of
nothing
at
last
delafield
appeared
again
one
of
the
decontamination
party
ran
up
in
a
jeep
with
a
microphone
what
ll
it
be
ross
demanded
alphabetic
order
or
just
a
rush
the
announcement
floored
him
representative
of
the
haarland
trading
corporation
please
report
to
the
decontamination
the
representative
of
the
haarland
trading
corporation
was
marconi
hell
ross
said
bitterly
good
luck
with
them
whoever
they
marconi
brooded
for
a
moment
and
then
said
gruffly
come
on
you
mean
it
sure
ross
you
ll
give
me
your
word
not
to
make
any
commercial
offers
or
inquiries
without
my
oh
they
started
across
the
field
and
were
checked
through
the
ready
line
marconi
cheerfully
presenting
his
identification
and
vouching
for
ross
captain
delafield
at
the
tank
snapped
what
are
you
doing
here
ross
you
re
oldham
s
man
i
distinctly
my
responsibility
captain
will
that
do
it
marconi
asked
delafield
snapped
it
ll
be
your
fundament
if
haarland
hears
about
it
actually
it
s
the
damnedest
for
haarland
marconi
looked
frightened
and
his
hand
involuntarily
went
to
his
breast
pocket
he
swallowed
and
asked
where
are
they
from
delafield
grimaced
and
said
marconi
exploded
oh
no
that
s
all
i
can
get
out
of
them
i
suppose
their
trajectory
can
be
analyzed
and
there
must
be
books
we
haven
t
been
in
the
ship
yet
nobody
goes
in
until
it
gets
sprayed
rayed
dusted
and
busted
down
into
its
component
parts
too
many
places
for
nasty
little
mutant
bacteria
and
viruses
to
sure
captain
home
eh
they
re
pretty
simple
happy
little
morons
fifteen
of
them
ranging
in
age
from
one
month
to
what
looks
like
a
hundred
and
twenty
all
they
know
is
home
and
we
wish
to
see
the
representative
of
the
haarland
trading
first
the
old
woman
said
it
then
the
next
in
must
be
about
a
it
then
a
pair
of
identical
twins
women
said
it
in
chorus
then
the
rest
of
them
on
down
to
the
baby
and
i
swear
to
god
he
tried
to
say
it
well
you
re
the
haarland
trading
corporation
go
on
they
were
all
naked
why
not
there
s
no
weather
in
a
space
ship
all
of
them
laughed
when
ross
and
marconi
came
in
through
the
lock
except
the
baby
who
was
nursing
at
the
breast
of
a
handsome
woman
their
laughter
was
what
attracted
ross
immediately
meanness
in
it
the
happy
yelping
of
puppies
at
play
with
a
red
rubber
bone
a
stab
went
through
him
as
the
pleasure
in
their
simple
happiness
turned
to
recollection
and
recognition
his
wife
of
a
decade
ago
ross
studied
them
with
amazement
expecting
to
find
her
features
in
their
features
her
figure
in
theirs
and
failed
yet
they
reminded
him
inescapably
of
his
miserable
year
with
that
but
they
were
physically
no
kin
of
hers
they
were
just
cheerful
laughers
who
he
knew
were
less
than
human
the
cheerful
laughers
exposed
unblemished
teeth
in
all
their
mouths
including
that
of
the
matriarch
why
not
if
you
put
calcium
and
fluorides
into
a
closed
system
they
stay
there
the
old
woman
stopped
laughing
at
them
long
enough
to
say
to
marconi
we
wish
to
see
the
representative
of
the
yes
i
know
i
m
the
representative
of
the
haarland
trading
corporation
welcome
to
halsey
s
planet
may
i
ask
what
your
name
is
ma
am
ma
she
said
genially
pleased
to
meet
you
ma
my
name
s
ma
said
bewildered
you
just
said
you
were
the
representative
of
the
haarland
yes
ma
but
that
s
all
right
let
s
say
that
s
my
other
name
two
she
laughed
at
the
idea
of
two
names
wonderingly
marconi
pressed
and
what
s
the
name
of
this
gentleman
he
isn
t
gentleman
he
s
sonny
was
a
hundred
years
old
pleased
to
meet
you
sonny
and
your
name
sir
sonny
said
a
redheaded
man
of
eighty
or
thereabouts
the
women
were
named
the
kids
the
baby
was
named
him
the
rest
of
the
troop
were
named
girl
ma
or
sonny
after
introductions
ross
noticed
that
him
had
been
passed
to
another
ma
who
was
placidly
suckling
him
she
had
milk
it
dribbled
from
the
corner
of
the
baby
s
mouth
there
isn
t
another
baby
left
in
the
ship
is
there
ross
asked
in
alarm
they
laughed
and
the
ma
suckling
the
baby
said
there
was
but
she
died
mostly
they
do
when
you
put
them
into
the
box
after
they
get
born
ma
here
was
lucky
her
him
didn
t
put
them
in
the
box
what
box
why
marconi
was
nudging
him
fiercely
in
the
ribs
he
ignored
it
they
laughed
amiably
at
his
ignorance
and
explained
that
the
box
was
the
box
and
that
you
put
your
newborn
babies
into
it
because
you
put
your
newborn
babies
into
it
a
beep
tone
sounded
from
the
ship
ma
said
we
have
to
go
back
now
the
representative
of
the
haarland
trading
corporation
what
for
ma
said
at
regular
intervals
signaled
by
a
tone
of
six
hundred
cycles
and
an
intermittent
downward
shifting
of
the
ship
lights
from
standard
illumination
frequency
to
a
signal
frequency
of
millimicrons
ship
s
operating
personnel
take
up
positions
at
the
control
boards
for
recalibration
of
meters
and
instruments
against
the
battery
of
standard
masters
we
ll
be
right
they
trooped
through
the
hatch
leaving
ross
and
marconi
staring
at
each
other
in
the
decontamination
tank
well
ross
said
slowly
at
last
i
know
why
the
longliner
departments
have
their
little
secrets
the
i
say
it
s
be
reasonable
marconi
told
his
own
face
was
white
under
the
glaring
germicidal
lamps
you
can
t
let
them
increase
without
limit
or
they
d
all
die
and
before
they
died
there
d
be
cannibalism
which
do
you
prefer
letting
kids
be
born
and
then
snuffing
them
out
if
a
computer
decides
they
re
the
wrong
sex
or
over
the
quota
is
i
didn
t
say
i
like
it
ross
but
it
so
do
pills
pills
are
a
private
matter
a
person
might
privately
decide
not
to
take
hers
the
box
is
a
public
matter
and
the
group
outnumbers
and
overrules
a
mother
who
decides
not
to
use
it
there
s
your
question
of
effectiveness
answered
but
there
s
another
point
those
people
are
sane
ross
preposterously
naive
but
sane
saner
than
childless
women
or
sour
old
bachelors
we
both
know
who
never
had
to
love
anything
small
and
helpless
and
so
come
to
love
nobody
but
themselves
they
re
sane
partly
because
the
women
get
a
periodic
biochemical
shakeup
called
pregnancy
that
their
biochemical
balance
is
designed
to
mesh
with
partly
because
the
men
find
tenderness
and
protectiveness
in
themselves
toward
the
pregnant
women
mostly
i
think
s
something
to
do
can
you
imagine
the
awful
monotony
of
life
in
the
ship
the
work
is
sheer
rote
and
repetition
they
can
t
read
or
watch
screentapes
they
were
born
in
the
ship
and
the
books
and
screentapes
are
meaningless
because
they
know
nothing
to
compare
them
with
the
only
change
they
see
is
each
other
aging
toward
death
frequent
pregnancies
are
a
godsend
to
them
they
compare
and
discuss
them
they
wonder
who
the
fathers
are
they
make
bets
of
rations
the
men
brag
and
keep
score
the
girls
look
forward
to
their
first
and
their
last
the
jokes
they
make
up
about
them
the
way
they
speculate
about
twins
the
purgative
fear
even
keeps
them
and
then
ross
said
the
staring
straight
ahead
at
the
ship
s
port
marconi
echoed
yes
the
if
there
were
another
there
isn
his
breezy
young
boss
charles
oldham
iv
was
not
pleased
with
what
ross
had
to
report
asked
for
haarland
he
repeated
unbelievingly
those
dummies
didn
t
know
where
they
were
going
or
where
they
were
from
but
they
knew
enough
to
ask
for
he
slammed
a
ruler
on
his
desk
and
yelled
it
mr
oldham
ross
protested
aghast
for
a
superior
to
lose
his
temper
publicly
was
unthinkable
it
covered
you
with
embarrassment
manners
be
too
oldham
screamed
breaking
up
fast
what
do
you
know
about
the
state
of
our
books
what
do
you
know
about
the
overhead
i
inherited
from
my
loving
father
what
the
hell
do
you
know
about
the
downcurve
in
sales
these
ross
began
soothingly
fluctuations
be
i
know
a
fluctuation
when
i
see
one
and
i
know
a
downtrend
when
i
see
one
and
that
s
what
we
re
riding
right
into
bankruptcy
fellow
and
now
these
dummies
blow
in
from
nowhere
with
a
consignment
exclusively
for
don
t
know
why
i
don
t
get
to
hell
out
of
this
stupid
business
and
go
live
in
a
shack
on
great
blue
lake
and
let
the
planet
go
ahead
and
ross
s
horror
at
the
unseemly
outburst
was
eclipsed
by
his
interest
at
noting
how
similarly
he
and
oldham
had
been
thinking
sir
he
ventured
i
ve
had
something
on
my
mind
for
a
it
can
wait
oldham
growled
collecting
himself
with
a
visible
effort
so
there
went
his
chance
to
resign
what
about
customs
i
know
haarland
hasn
t
got
enough
cash
to
lay
out
who
has
ross
said
glibly
usual
arrangement
sir
they
turn
an
estimated
per
cent
of
the
cargo
over
to
the
port
authority
for
auction
the
receipts
to
be
in
full
discharge
of
their
import
tax
and
i
suppose
they
enter
protective
bids
they
aren
t
wasting
any
s
you
handle
it
oldham
muttered
don
t
go
over
one
hundred
thousand
shields
diversify
the
purchases
as
much
as
possible
and
try
to
sneak
some
advance
information
out
of
the
dummies
if
you
get
a
yes
sir
ross
said
as
he
left
he
saw
oldham
taking
a
plastic
bottle
from
a
wall
cabinet
and
that
thought
ross
as
he
rode
to
the
free
port
was
the
first
crack
he
had
ever
seen
in
the
determined
optimism
of
the
trading
firm
s
top
level
they
were
optimists
and
they
were
idealists
at
least
to
hear
them
tell
it
interplanetary
trading
was
a
cause
and
a
mission
the
traders
kept
the
flame
of
commerce
alight
perhaps
thought
ross
they
had
been
able
to
indulge
in
the
hypocrisy
of
idealism
only
so
long
as
a
population
upcurve
assured
them
of
an
expanding
market
perhaps
now
that
births
were
flattening
said
the
dirty
word
declining
all
would
drop
their
optimistic
creed
in
favor
of
competition
for
the
favors
of
the
dwindling
pool
of
consumers
and
that
ross
thought
gloomily
was
the
way
he
d
go
himself
if
he
stayed
on
junior
trader
to
senior
trader
to
master
trader
growing
every
year
more
paranoidally
suspicious
of
his
peers
less
scrupulous
in
the
chase
of
the
shield
but
he
was
getting
out
of
course
the
purser
s
berth
awaited
and
then
perhaps
the
awful
depressions
he
had
been
enduring
would
lift
off
him
he
thought
of
the
master
traders
he
knew
his
own
man
oldham
none
too
happy
in
the
hereditary
business
leverett
still
smug
and
fat
with
his
terrific
windfall
of
the
sirius
iv
starship
fifteen
years
ago
marconi
s
boss
broke
the
sequence
all
to
hell
it
just
wasn
t
possible
to
think
of
haarland
being
driven
by
avarice
and
fear
he
was
the
oldest
of
them
all
but
there
was
more
zest
and
drive
in
his
parchment
body
than
in
the
rest
of
them
combined
in
the
auction
hall
ross
found
a
seat
near
the
velvet
ropes
one
of
the
professional
bidders
lounging
against
a
wall
flicked
him
an
almost
imperceptible
signal
and
he
answered
with
another
that
was
that
he
had
his
man
and
a
good
one
they
had
often
worked
together
in
the
commodity
pits
but
not
so
often
or
so
exclusively
that
the
bidder
would
be
instantly
known
as
his
inside
the
enclosure
marconi
seated
at
a
bare
table
labored
over
a
sheaf
of
papers
with
one
of
the
sonnies
from
the
ship
sonny
was
wriggling
in
coveralls
the
first
clothes
he
had
ever
worn
ross
saw
they
hadn
t
been
able
to
get
shoes
onto
him
who
else
did
he
know
captain
delafield
was
sitting
somberly
within
the
enclosure
win
fraley
the
hottest
auctioneer
on
the
port
was
studying
a
list
his
lips
moving
every
trading
firm
was
represented
the
heads
of
the
smaller
firms
were
there
in
person
not
daring
to
delegate
the
bidding
job
plenty
of
port
personnel
just
there
for
the
excitement
of
the
first
longliner
in
fifteen
years
even
though
it
was
well
after
close
of
the
business
day
the
goods
were
in
sealed
cases
against
the
back
wall
as
usual
ross
could
only
tell
that
some
of
them
were
perforated
and
therefore
ought
to
contain
living
animals
only
the
one
sonny
from
the
starship
crew
was
there
presumably
the
rest
were
back
on
the
ship
he
wouldn
t
be
able
to
follow
oldham
s
orders
to
snoop
out
the
nature
of
the
freight
from
them
well
damn
oldham
damn
even
the
auction
ross
thought
to
himself
his
mood
of
gloom
did
not
lift
the
auction
was
a
kind
of
letdown
all
that
turmoil
and
bustle
concentrated
in
a
tiny
arc
around
the
velvet
ropes
contrasted
unpleasantly
with
the
long
vacant
rows
of
dusty
seats
that
stretched
to
the
back
of
the
hall
maybe
a
couple
of
centuries
ago
ross
would
have
enjoyed
the
auction
more
but
now
all
it
made
him
think
of
was
the
thing
he
had
been
brooding
about
for
a
night
and
a
day
the
slow
emptying
of
the
planet
the
decay
but
as
usual
no
one
else
seemed
to
notice
or
to
care
captain
delafield
consulted
his
watch
and
stood
up
he
rapped
the
table
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
trade
commission
and
the
appropriate
governing
statutes
he
droned
certain
merchandise
will
now
be
placed
on
public
auction
the
haarland
trading
corporation
consignee
agrees
and
consents
to
divest
itself
of
merchandise
from
consignment
amounting
by
estimate
of
the
customs
authorities
to
per
cent
of
the
total
value
of
all
merchandise
in
said
consignment
all
receipts
of
this
auction
are
to
be
entered
as
excise
duties
paid
by
the
consignee
on
said
merchandise
said
receipts
to
constitute
payment
in
full
on

on

the
clerk
will
record
if
any
person
here
present
wishes
to
enter
an
objection
let
him
do
so
thank
he
glanced
at
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
hand
i
am
requested
to
inform
you
that
the
haarland
trading
corporation
has
entered
with
the
clerk
a
protective
bid
of
five
thousand
shields
on
each
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
hall
five
thousand
shields
was
a
lot
of
money
your
auctioneer
win
fraley
said
captain
delafield
and
sat
down
in
the
first
row
of
seats
the
auctioneer
took
a
long
slow
swallow
of
water
his
eyes
gleaming
above
the
glass
at
the
audience
theatrically
he
tossed
the
glass
to
an
assistant
smacked
his
hands
together
and
grinned
well
he
boomed
genially
i
don
t
have
to
tell
you
gentlemen
that
somebody
s
going
to
get
rich
tonight
who
it
ll
be
you
but
you
can
t
make
money
without
spending
money
so
without
any
further
ado
let
s
get
started
i
have
here
he
rapped
out
briskly
item
number
one
now
you
don
t
know
and
i
don
t
know
exactly
what
item
number
one
contains
but
i
can
tell
you
this
they
wouldn
t
have
sent
it
two
hundred
and
lights
if
they
didn
t
think
it
was
worth
something
let
s
get
this
started
with
a
rush
folks
and
i
mean
with
a
big
bid
to
get
in
the
right
mood
after
all
the
more
you
spend
here
the
less
you
have
to
pay
in
taxes
he
laughed
you
ready
here
s
the
dope
item
number
his
assistant
slapped
a
carton
at
the
extreme
left
of
the
line
two
hundred
and
fifteen
grams
net
fifteen
cubic
centimeters
one
microfilm
reel
included
reminds
me
he
reminisced
of
an
item
just
about
that
size
on
the
sirius
iv
shipment
turned
out
to
be
maryjane
seeds
and
i
don
t
suppose
i
have
to
tell
anybody
here
how
much
leverett
made
out
of
maryjanes
i
bet
every
one
of
us
has
been
smoking
them
ever
since
what
do
you
say
leverett
you
did
all
right
last
to
say
ten
thousand
as
a
first
big
bid
on
item
number
one
nine
thousand
do
i
one
of
the
smaller
traders
not
working
through
a
professional
bidder
not
even
decently
delegating
the
work
to
a
junior
bid
hundred
shields
like
the
spokesmen
for
the
other
big
traders
ross
sat
on
his
hands
during
the
early
stages
let
the
small
fry
give
themselves
a
thrill
and
drop
out
the
big
firms
knew
to
a
fraction
of
a
shield
how
much
the
small
ones
could
afford
to
bid
on
a
blind
purchase
and
the
easiest
way
to
handle
them
was
to
let
them
spend
their
budgets
in
a
hurry
of
course
the
small
traders
knew
all
this
and
their
strategy
when
they
could
manage
it
was
to
hold
back
as
long
as
possible
it
was
a
matter
of
sensing
emotion
rather
than
counting
costs
of
recognizing
the
fraction
of
a
second
in
which
a
little
fellow
made
up
his
mind
to
acquire
an
item
and
bidding
him
knowing
when
he
d
gone
his
limit
and
letting
him
have
it
at
a
ruinous
price
it
was
an
art
and
ross
despising
it
knew
that
he
did
it
very
very
well
he
yawned
and
pretended
to
read
a
magazine
while
the
first
six
items
went
on
the
block
the
little
traders
seemed
desperate
enough
to
force
the
price
up
without
help
he
bid
on
item
seven
partly
to
squeeze
a
runt
trader
and
partly
to
test
his
liaison
with
his
professional
bidder
it
was
perfect
the
pro
caught
his
bored
inspection
of
his
seeming
to
peek
clumsily
at
the
man
from
leverett
s
ross
let
the
next
two
pass
and
then
acquired
three
items
in
rapid
succession
the
fever
had
spread
to
most
of
the
bidders
by
then
they
were
starting
at
ten
thousand
and
up
one
or
two
of
the
early
birds
had
spent
their
budgets
and
were
leaving
looking
indeed
they
had
been
ross
signaled
take
five
to
his
professional
and
strolled
out
for
a
cup
of
coffee
on
the
way
back
he
stopped
for
a
moment
outside
the
hall
to
look
at
the
stars
and
breathe
there
were
the
familiar
plowman
the
rocket
fleet
marilyn
monroe
he
stood
smoking
a
cigarette
and
yearning
toward
them
until
somebody
moved
in
the
darkness
near
him
nice
night
ross
the
man
said
gloomily
it
was
captain
delafield
oh
hello
sir
ross
said
the
world
descending
around
him
again
like
a
curtain
taking
a
breather
had
to
the
captain
growled
ten
more
minutes
in
that
place
and
i
would
have
thrown
damned
traders
no
offense
ross
just
that
i
don
t
see
how
you
stand
the
life
seems
to
have
got
worse
in
my
time
much
worse
you
goading
the
into
shooting
their
didn
t
use
to
be
like
that
gallantry
not
stomping
a
downed
man
i
don
t
see
how
you
stand
i
can
t
stand
it
ross
said
quietly
captain
delafield
you
don
t
m
so
sick
to
death
of
the
life
i
m
leading
and
the
work
i
m
doing
that
i
d
do
anything
to
get
away
fallon
offered
me
a
purser
s
spot
on
his
ship
i
ve
been
thinking
about
it
very
purser
a
dirty
job
there
s
nothing
to
do
except
when
you
re
in
port
and
then
there
s
so
much
to
do
that
you
never
get
to
see
the
planet
i
don
t
recommend
it
ross
grunted
thinking
if
even
the
purser
s
berth
was
no
way
out
what
was
left
for
him
sixty
more
years
of
waiting
for
a
starship
and
scheming
how
to
make
a
profit
from
its
contents
sixty
more
years
watching
ghost
town
grow
by
nibbles
on
halsey
city
watching
the
traders
wax
in
savagery
as
they
battled
for
the
pool
of
consumers
watching
obscene
comedies
like
lurline
of
the
old
landowners
graciously
consenting
to
wed
marconi
of
the
new
nobodies
he
said
wearily
then
what
shall
i
do
captain
rot
here
with
the
rest
of
the
planet
delafield
shrugged
suprisingly
gentle
you
feel
it
too
ross
i
m
glad
to
hear
it
i
m
not
sensitive
thank
god
but
i
know
they
talk
about
me
they
say
i
quit
the
fleet
as
soon
as
i
had
a
chance
to
grab
off
the
port
captaincy
they
re
right
i
did
because
i
was
frightened
you
delafield
s
ribbons
for
a
dozen
heroic
rescues
gleamed
in
the
light
that
escaped
from
the
hall
sure
he
flicked
the
ribbons
each
one
of
these
means
i
and
my
men
pulled
some
people
out
of
a
jam
they
got
into
because
of
somebody
s
damned
stupidity
or
slow
reflexes
or
defective
memory
no
i
withdraw
that
the
thetis
got
stove
in
because
of
mechanical
failure
but
all
the
rest
were
human
error
there
got
to
be
too
many
for
me
i
want
to
enjoy
my
old
age
ready
to
face
that
if
you
become
a
purser
i
can
tell
you
that
if
you
don
t
like
it
here
you
won
t
be
happy
on
sunward
and
you
won
t
like
the
moons
and
you
most
especially
and
particularly
won
t
like
being
a
purser
it
s
the
same
job
you
re
doing
now
but
it
pays
less
offers
you
a
cubicle
to
work
and
live
in
and
gives
you
nothing
resembling
a
future
to
aim
at
now
if
you
ll
excuse
me
i
d
better
get
back
inside
i
ve
enjoyed
our
ross
followed
the
captain
gloomily
nothing
had
changed
inside
ross
lounged
in
the
doorway
inconspicuously
picking
up
the
eye
of
his
bidder
marconi
was
gone
from
the
enclosure
ross
looked
around
hopefully
and
found
his
friend
in
agitated
conversation
with
an
unrecognizable
but
also
agitated
man
at
the
back
of
the
hall
ross
drifted
over
heads
were
turning
in
the
front
rows
as
ross
got
within
range
he
heard
a
couple
of
phrases
the
ship
haarland
specially
asked
for
you
please
marconi
oh
hell
marconi
said
disgustedly
go
on
tell
him
i
ll
be
there
but
how
he
expects
me
to
take
care
of
things
here
he
trailed
off
as
he
caught
sight
of
ross
trouble
ross
asked
not
exactly
the
hell
with
marconi
stared
indecisively
at
the
auctioneer
for
a
moment
he
said
obscurely
taking
your
life
isn
t
enough
he
wants
more
and
i
thought
i
d
be
able
to
see
lurline
tonight
excuse
me
ross
i
ve
got
to
get
over
to
the
he
hurried
out
ross
looked
wonderingly
after
him
caught
the
eye
of
his
bidder
and
went
back
to
work
by
the
time
the
auction
was
over
and
dawn
was
breaking
in
the
west
oldham
trading
had
bought
nine
lots
of
merchandise
three
breathing
five
flowering
and
one
a
roll
of
microfilm
ross
took
his
prizes
to
the
office
where
charles
oldham
was
waiting
much
the
better
for
a
few
drinks
and
a
long
nap
how
much
demanded
oldham
evidently
they
were
both
supposed
to
ignore
his
hysteria
of
the
night
before
thousand
ross
said
dully
for
nine
lots
good
man
with
any
kind
of
luck
at
and
oldham
babbled
on
and
on
he
wanted
ross
to
stay
and
view
the
microfilm
projection
stand
by
for
a
report
from
a
zoologist
and
a
botanist
on
the
living
acquisitions
he
pleaded
weariness
and
oldham
became
conciliatory
to
the
wonderful
young
who
had
bid
in
the
merchandise
at
a
whopping
bargain
price
ross
dragged
himself
from
the
building
into
a
cab
and
home
morosely
undressing
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
brooded
well
that
was
it
what
you
d
been
waiting
for
since
you
were
a
junior
apprentice
the
starship
came
you
had
the
alien
prizes
in
your
hands
and
you
realized
they
were
as
tawdry
as
the
cheap
gimcracks
you
export
every
week
to
sunward
he
stared
out
the
window
over
ghost
town
to
the
field
the
sun
was
high
over
the
surrounding
mountains
he
imagined
he
could
pick
out
the
reflected
glimmer
from
the
starship
a
dozen
miles
away
marconi
at
least
got
to
examine
the
ship
marconi
might
be
there
now
he
d
been
headed
that
way
when
ross
saw
him
last
and
evidently
not
enjoying
it
much
ross
wondered
vaguely
if
anybody
really
enjoyed
anything
he
stubbed
out
his
cigarette
as
he
fell
asleep
he
was
remembering
what
delafield
had
told
him
about
the
moons
and
the
planet
ports
his
dreams
were
of
the
cities
of
other
planets
and
every
one
of
them
was
populated
by
aloof
delafields
and
avaricious
oldhams
wake
up
ross
marconi
was
saying
joggling
him
come
on
wake
ross
thrust
himself
up
on
an
elbow
and
opened
his
eyes
he
said
with
a
tongue
the
size
of
his
forearm
in
a
mouth
wha
time
is
it
wha
the
hell
are
you
doing
here
for
that
matter
it
s
around
noon
you
ve
slept
for
three
hours
you
can
get
ross
automatically
reached
for
a
cigarette
the
smoke
got
in
his
eyes
and
he
rubbed
them
it
dehydrated
and
seared
what
little
healthy
tissue
appeared
to
be
left
in
his
mouth
but
it
woke
him
up
a
little
what
are
you
doing
here
he
demanded
marconi
s
hand
was
involuntarily
on
his
breast
pocket
again
the
one
in
which
he
carried
lurline
s
picture
he
said
harshly
you
want
a
job
topside
better
than
purser
he
wasn
t
meeting
ross
s
eye
his
gaze
roved
around
the
apartment
and
lighted
on
a
coffee
maker
he
filled
it
and
snapped
it
on
get
dressed
will
you
he
demanded
ross
sat
up
what
s
this
all
about
marconi
what
do
you
want
anyway
marconi
for
his
own
reasons
became
violently
angry
you
re
the
damnedest
i
ever
did
meet
ross
i
m
trying
to
do
you
a
what
favor
ross
asked
suspiciously
you
ll
find
out
you
ve
been
bellyaching
to
me
long
enough
about
how
dull
your
poor
little
life
is
well
i
m
offering
you
a
chance
to
do
something
big
and
different
and
what
do
you
do
you
crawfish
are
you
interested
or
aren
t
you
i
told
you
it
s
a
space
job
and
a
big
one
bigger
than
being
a
purser
for
fallon
bigger
than
you
can
ross
began
to
struggle
into
his
clothes
no
more
than
half
comprehending
but
stimulated
by
the
magic
words
he
asked
puzzling
sleepily
over
what
marconi
had
said
what
are
you
sore
about
his
guess
was
that
lurline
had
broken
a
it
seemed
to
be
the
wrong
time
of
day
for
that
nothing
marconi
said
grumpily
only
i
have
my
own
life
to
he
poured
two
cups
of
coffee
he
wouldn
t
answer
questions
while
they
sipped
the
scalding
stuff
but
somehow
ross
was
not
surprised
when
downstairs
marconi
headed
his
car
along
the
winding
road
through
ghost
town
that
led
to
the
yards
every
muscle
of
ross
s
body
was
stiff
and
creaky
another
six
hours
of
sleep
would
have
been
a
wonderful
thing
but
as
they
drove
through
the
rutted
streets
of
ghost
town
he
began
to
feel
alive
again
he
stared
out
the
window
at
the
flashing
ruins
piecing
together
the
things
marconi
had
said
watch
it
he
yelled
and
marconi
swerved
the
car
around
a
tumbled
wall
ross
was
shaking
but
marconi
only
drove
faster
this
was
crazy
you
didn
t
race
through
ghost
town
as
though
you
were
on
the
pleasure
parkways
around
the
great
blue
lake
it
wasn
t
safe
the
buildings
had
to
fall
over
from
time
to
certainly
bothered
to
keep
them
in
repair
and
nobody
bothered
to
pick
up
the
pieces
when
they
fell
either
until
the
infrequent
teams
made
their
rounds
but
at
last
they
were
out
of
ghost
town
on
the
broad
highway
from
halsey
city
to
the
port
the
administration
building
and
car
park
was
just
ahead
it
was
there
that
marconi
spoke
again
i
m
assuming
ross
that
you
weren
t
snowing
me
when
you
said
you
wanted
thrills
chills
and
change
that
s
not
the
way
i
put
it
but
i
wasn
t
snowing
you
ll
get
them
come
he
led
ross
across
the
field
to
the
longliner
past
a
gaggle
of
laughing
chattering
sonnies
and
mas
he
ignored
them
the
longliner
was
a
giant
of
a
ship
a
blunt
torpedo
a
hundred
meters
tall
it
had
no
enough
the
designers
of
the
ship
certainly
didn
t
find
any
reason
for
its
idiot
crew
to
look
out
into
space
and
landings
and
takeoffs
would
be
two
hundred
years
old
it
was
but
its
metal
was
as
bright
its
edges
as
sharp
as
the
newest
of
the
moon
freighters
at
the
other
end
of
the
hardstand
two
hundred
long
trip
but
an
almost
unimaginably
long
distance
that
trip
covered
for
the
star
that
spawned
it
was
undoubtedly
almost
as
far
away
as
light
would
travel
in
two
centuries
time
at
miles
per
second
sixty
seconds
in
a
minute
sixty
minutes
in
an
hour
ross
s
imagination
gave
up
the
task
it
was
far
he
stared
about
him
in
fascination
as
they
entered
the
ship
he
gaped
at
sterile
cubicles
each
of
which
contained
the
same
chair
and
screen
or
projector
for
longliners
ross
remembered
his
rash
words
of
the
day
before
about
shipping
out
on
a
longliner
and
shuddered
here
we
are
said
marconi
stopping
before
a
closed
door
he
knocked
and
entered
it
was
a
cubicle
like
the
others
but
there
were
reels
stacked
on
the
floor
and
a
projector
sitting
on
the
cot
in
a
attitude
was
old
man
haarland
himself
ross
thought
watchful
haarland
asked
ross
yes
sir
marconi
said
there
was
tension
in
his
voice
and
attitude
do
you
want
me
to
stay
sir
haarland
growled
good
god
no
you
can
get
out
sit
down
ross
sat
down
marconi
carefully
looking
neither
to
right
or
left
went
out
and
closed
the
door
haarland
stretched
scratched
and
yawned
he
said
ross
marconi
tells
me
you
re
quite
a
fellow
sincere
competent
a
good
man
to
give
a
tough
job
to
namely
trader
ross
asked
bewildered
a
little
more
dramatic
than
we
ll
come
to
the
details
in
a
minute
i
m
told
you
were
ready
to
quit
oldham
for
a
purser
s
berth
that
s
ethical
would
you
consider
it
unethical
to
quit
oldham
for
haarland
think
i
glad
to
hear
it
what
if
the
work
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
trading
and
never
brings
you
into
a
competitive
situation
with
oldham
ross
scratched
his
jaw
well
i
think
that
would
be
all
right
but
a
junior
fourth
s
job
the
floor
bucked
and
surged
under
him
he
gasped
what
was
that
blastoff
i
imagine
haarland
said
calmly
we
re
taking
off
better
lie
ross
flopped
to
the
floor
it
was
no
time
to
argue
not
with
the
pumps
thundering
and
the
preheaters
roaring
their
threat
of
an
imminent
thrust
it
came
like
thunder
slapping
ross
against
the
floor
plates
as
though
he
were
glued
to
them
he
felt
every
tiny
wrinkle
in
every
weld
he
lay
on
and
one
arm
had
fallen
across
a
film
reel
he
heaved
and
succeeded
in
levering
it
off
the
reel
it
thwacked
to
the
floor
as
though
sandbags
were
stacked
atop
it
blackout
came
very
soon
he
awoke
in
free
fall
he
was
orbiting
aimlessly
about
the
cubicle
haarland
was
strapped
to
the
cot
absorbed
in
manipulating
the
portable
projector
trying
to
thread
a
film
ross
bumped
against
the
old
man
haarland
abstractedly
shoved
him
off
he
careened
from
a
bulkhead
and
flailed
for
a
grip
oh
said
haarland
looking
up
awake
yes
awake
ross
said
bitterly
what
is
all
this
where
are
we
the
old
man
said
formally
please
forgive
my
cavalier
treatment
of
you
you
must
not
blame
your
friend
marconi
he
had
no
idea
that
i
was
planning
an
immediate
blastoff
with
you
i
had
an
assignment
for
him
which
preferred
not
to
accept
not
to
mince
words
ross
he
quit
his
job
the
old
man
shook
his
head
no
ross
quit
much
more
than
the
job
of
working
for
me
he
quit
on
an
assignment
which
am
sorry
if
it
sounds
vital
to
the
human
he
suddenly
frowned
think
he
added
weakly
bear
with
me
ross
i
ll
try
to
explain
as
i
go
along
but
you
see
marconi
left
me
in
the
lurch
i
needed
him
and
he
failed
me
he
felt
that
you
would
be
glad
to
take
it
on
and
he
told
me
something
about
haarland
glowered
at
ross
and
said
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
a
recommendation
from
marconi
at
this
particular
point
is
hardly
any
recommendation
at
all
but
i
haven
t
much
besides
i
took
the
liberty
of
calling
that
pompous
young
fool
you
work
mister
haarland
ross
cried
outraged
oldham
may
not
be
any
prize
but
oh
you
know
he
s
a
fool
but
he
had
a
lot
to
say
about
you
enough
so
that
if
you
want
the
assignment
it
s
yours
as
to
the
nature
of
the
assignment
haarland
hesitated
then
said
briskly
the
assignment
itself
has
to
do
with
a
message
my
organization
received
via
this
longliner
yes
a
message
you
ll
see
it
has
also
to
do
with
certain
facts
i
ve
found
in
its
log
which
if
i
can
ever
get
this
damned
thing
we
he
had
succeeded
in
threading
the
film
he
snapped
on
the
projector
on
the
screen
appeared
a
densely
packed
block
of
numerals
rolling
up
and
being
replaced
by
new
lines
as
fast
as
the
eye
could
take
them
in
haarland
said
notice
anything
ross
swallowed
if
that
stuff
is
supposed
to
mean
anything
to
me
he
declared
it
doesn
haarland
frowned
but
marconi
never
he
snapped
off
the
projector
that
was
the
ship
s
log
ross
it
doesn
t
matter
if
you
can
t
read
it
you
wouldn
t
i
suppose
have
had
much
call
for
that
sort
of
thing
working
for
oldham
it
is
a
mathematical
description
of
the
routing
of
this
ship
from
the
time
it
was
until
it
arrived
here
yesterday
it
took
a
long
time
ross
the
reason
that
it
took
a
long
time
is
partly
that
it
came
from
far
away
but
even
more
there
is
another
reason
we
were
not
this
ship
s
destination
not
the
original
destination
we
weren
t
even
the
first
the
second
alternate
to
be
exact
ross
we
were
the
seventh
choice
for
this
ross
let
go
of
his
stanchion
floated
a
yard
and
flailed
back
to
it
that
s
ridiculous
haarland
he
protested
besides
what
has
all
this
to
do
bear
with
an
old
man
said
haarland
with
an
amused
gleam
in
his
eye
there
was
very
little
he
could
do
but
bear
with
him
ross
thought
sourly
go
on
he
said
haarland
said
professorially
it
is
conceivable
of
course
that
a
planet
might
be
asleep
at
the
switch
we
could
believe
it
i
suppose
if
it
seemed
that
the
planet
somehow
didn
t
pick
the
ship
up
when
this
longliner
came
into
radar
range
in
that
event
of
course
it
would
orbit
once
or
twice
on
automatics
and
then
select
for
its
first
alternate
it
did
it
might
be
a
human
failure
in
the
gca
he
nodded
earnestly
once
ross
not
six
times
no
planet
passes
up
a
trading
mr
haarland
ross
exploded
it
seems
to
me
that
you
re
contradicting
yourself
all
over
the
place
did
six
planets
pass
this
ship
up
or
didn
t
six
planets
pass
this
ship
up
which
is
it
and
why
would
anybody
pass
a
longliner
up
anyhow
haarland
asked
suppose
the
planets
were
vacant
what
ross
was
shaken
but
that
s
silly
i
mean
even
i
know
that
the
star
charts
show
which
planets
are
inhabited
and
which
aren
and
suppose
the
star
charts
are
wrong
suppose
the
planets
have
become
vacant
the
people
have
died
off
perhaps
their
culture
decay
death
and
decay
ross
was
silent
for
a
long
time
he
took
a
deep
breath
he
said
at
last
sorry
i
won
t
interrupt
haarland
s
expression
was
a
weft
of
triumph
and
relief
six
planets
passed
this
ship
up
remember
leverett
s
ship
fifteen
years
ago
three
planets
passed
that
one
before
it
came
to
us
nine
different
planets
all
listed
on
the
traditional
star
charts
as
inhabited
civilized
equipped
with
gca
radars
and
everything
else
needed
nine
planets
out
of
communication
decay
thought
ross
aloud
he
said
tell
me
haarland
shook
his
head
no
he
said
strongly
i
want
you
to
tell
me
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
can
i
ll
tell
you
the
message
that
this
ship
brought
to
me
i
ll
tell
you
all
i
know
all
i
ve
told
marconi
that
he
isn
t
man
enough
to
use
and
the
things
that
marconi
will
never
learn
as
well
but
why
nine
planets
that
used
to
be
pretty
much
like
our
own
planet
are
now
out
of
communication
that
you
ll
have
to
tell
forward
rockets
boomed
the
braking
blasts
hurled
ross
against
the
forward
bulkhead
haarland
rummaged
under
the
cot
for
space
suits
he
flung
one
at
ross
put
it
on
he
ordered
come
to
the
airlock
i
ll
show
you
what
you
can
use
to
find
out
the
he
slid
into
the
pressure
suit
dived
weightless
down
the
corridor
ross
zooming
after
they
stood
in
the
airlock
helmets
sealed
wordlessly
haarland
opened
the
pet
cocks
heaved
on
the
lock
door
he
gestured
with
an
arm
floating
alongside
them
was
a
ship
a
ship
like
none
ross
had
ever
seen
before
picture
leif
s
longboat
bobbing
in
the
swells
outside
ambrose
light
while
the
liners
steam
past
a
tiny
ancient
thing
related
to
the
new
giants
only
as
the
eohippus
resembles
the
horse
the
ship
that
haarland
revealed
was
fully
as
great
a
contrast
ross
knew
spaceships
as
well
as
any
grounder
could
both
the
lumbering
interplanet
freighters
and
the
titanic
longliners
but
the
ship
that
swung
around
halsey
s
planet
was
a
midget
fueled
rocket
ships
must
be
huge
its
jets
were
absurdly
tiny
clearly
incapable
of
blasting
away
from
planetary
gravity
its
entire
hull
length
was
unbroken
and
sheer
did
the
pilot
dare
fly
blind
the
coupling
connections
were
being
rigged
between
the
ships
come
aboard
said
haarland
spryly
wriggling
through
the
passage
ross
swallowing
his
astonishment
followed
the
ship
was
tiny
indeed
when
ross
and
haarland
clutching
handholds
were
drifting
weightlessly
in
its
central
control
cabin
they
very
nearly
filled
it
there
was
one
other
cabin
ross
saw
and
the
two
compartments
accounted
for
a
good
of
the
cubage
of
the
ship
where
that
left
space
for
the
combustion
chambers
and
the
fuel
tanks
the
crew
quarters
and
the
cargo
holds
ross
could
not
imagine
he
said
all
right
haarland
haarland
grinned
toothily
his
expression
eerie
in
the
flickering
violet
light
that
issued
from
a
gutter
around
the
cabin
s
wall
this
is
a
spaceship
ross
it
s
a
pretty
old
hundred
years
give
or
take
a
little
it
s
not
much
to
look
at
compared
with
the
models
you
re
used
to
but
it
s
got
a
few
features
that
you
won
t
find
on
the
new
ones
for
one
thing
ross
it
doesn
t
use
he
hesitated
ask
me
what
it
does
use
he
admitted
and
i
can
t
tell
you
i
know
the
name
because
i
read
it
nucleophoretic
drive
what
nucleophoresis
is
and
how
it
works
i
can
t
say
they
call
it
the
wesley
effect
and
the
tech
manual
says
something
about
squared
miles
of
acceleration
does
that
mean
anything
to
you
no
how
could
it
but
it
works
ross
it
works
well
enough
so
that
this
little
ship
will
get
you
where
you
re
going
very
quickly
the
stars
will
take
you
to
the
stars
faster
than
light
what
the
top
speed
is
i
have
no
idea
but
there
is
a
ship
s
log
here
too
and
it
has
a
months
ross
which
this
little
ship
explored
the
solar
systems
of
fourteen
ross
held
motionless
haarland
paused
fourteen
hundred
years
he
repeated
fourteen
hundred
years
this
ship
has
been
floating
out
here
and
for
all
that
time
the
longliners
have
been
crawling
from
star
to
star
while
little
hidden
ships
like
this
one
could
have
carried
a
thousand
times
as
much
goods
a
million
times
faster
maybe
the
time
has
come
to
get
the
ships
out
of
hiding
i
don
t
know
i
want
to
find
out
i
want
you
to
find
out
for
me
i
ll
be
specific
ross
i
need
a
pilot
i
m
too
old
and
marconi
turned
it
down
someone
has
to
go
out
he
gestured
to
the
blind
hull
and
the
unseen
stars
and
find
out
why
nine
planets
are
out
of
communication
will
you
do
it
ross
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
a
thousand
questions
competed
for
utterance
but
what
he
said
barely
aloud
was
only
the
than
a
thousand
million
of
them
in
our
galaxy
alone
by
far
the
greatest
number
of
them
drifted
alone
through
space
or
with
only
a
stellar
companion
as
utterly
unlivable
by
reason
of
heat
and
crushing
gravity
as
themselves
fewer
than
one
in
a
million
had
a
family
of
planets
and
most
even
of
those
could
never
become
a
home
for
human
life
but
out
of
a
thousand
million
any
fraction
may
be
a
very
large
number
and
the
number
of
habitable
planets
was
in
the
hundreds
ross
had
seen
the
master
charts
of
the
inhabited
universe
often
enough
to
recognize
the
names
as
haarland
mentioned
them
tau
ceti
ii
earth
the
eight
inhabitable
worlds
of
capella
but
to
realize
that
this
ship
touched
down
on
each
of
them
and
on
a
hundred
more
was
beyond
astonishment
it
was
a
dream
thing
impossible
but
unquestioned
through
haarland
s
burning
old
eyes
ross
looked
back
through
fourteen
centuries
to
the
time
when
this
ship
was
a
scout
vessel
for
a
colonizing
colossus
the
lumbering
giant
drove
slowly
through
space
on
its
trip
from
the
planet
that
built
it
earth
the
records
were
not
the
tiny
scout
probed
each
star
and
solar
system
as
it
drew
within
range
while
the
mother
ship
was
covering
a
few
hundred
million
miles
the
scout
might
flash
across
parsecs
to
scan
half
a
dozen
worlds
and
when
the
scout
came
back
with
word
of
a
planet
where
humans
could
survive
they
christened
it
with
the
name
of
the
scout
s
pilot
and
the
chartroom
labored
and
the
ship
s
officers
gave
orders
and
the
giant
s
nose
swerved
through
a
half
a
degree
and
began
its
long
slow
deceleration
why
slow
ross
demanded
why
not
use
the
drive
for
the
big
ships
haarland
grimaced
i
ve
got
to
answer
that
one
for
you
sooner
or
later
he
said
but
let
me
make
it
later
anyway
that
s
what
this
ship
was
a
scout
ship
for
a
real
longliner
what
happened
to
the
longliner
the
records
don
t
show
my
guess
is
the
colonists
cannibalized
it
to
get
a
start
in
constructing
homes
for
themselves
but
the
scout
ship
was
exempted
the
captain
of
the
expedition
had
it
put
in
an
orbit
out
here
and
left
alone
it
s
been
used
a
little
bit
now
and
s
father
went
clear
to
eridani
when
my
was
a
little
boy
but
by
and
large
it
has
been
left
alone
it
had
to
be
ross
for
one
thing
it
s
dangerous
to
the
man
who
pilots
it
for
another
it
s
dangerous
haarland
s
view
was
anthropomorphic
the
danger
was
not
to
the
immense
and
uncaring
galaxy
but
to
the
sparse
fester
of
life
that
called
itself
humanity
when
the
race
abandoned
earth
it
was
a
gesture
of
revulsion
behind
them
they
left
a
planet
that
had
decimated
itself
in
wars
ahead
lay
a
cosmos
that
in
all
their
searches
had
revealed
no
truly
sentient
life
earth
was
a
crippled
world
the
victim
of
its
playing
with
nuclear
fission
and
fusion
but
the
techniques
that
gave
them
a
drive
gave
them
as
well
a
weapon
that
threatened
solar
systems
not
cities
that
could
detonate
a
sun
as
readily
as
uranium
could
destroy
a
building
the
child
with
his
forbidden
matches
was
now
sitting
atop
a
munitions
dump
the
danger
was
no
longer
a
seared
hand
or
blinded
eye
but
annihilation
and
the
decision
had
been
made
secrecy
by
what
condign
struggles
the
secrecy
had
been
enforced
the
secrecy
itself
concealed
but
it
had
worked
once
the
radiating
colonizers
had
reached
their
goals
the
nucleophoretic
effect
had
been
obliterated
from
their
records
and
except
for
a
single
man
on
each
planet
from
their
minds
why
the
single
man
why
not
bury
it
entirely
haarland
said
slowly
there
was
always
the
chance
that
something
would
go
wrong
you
see
ross
said
hesitantly
you
mean
the
nine
planets
that
have
gone
out
of
communication
haarland
nodded
he
hesitated
do
you
understand
it
now
he
asked
ross
shook
his
head
dizzily
i
m
trying
he
said
this
little
travels
faster
than
light
it
has
been
circling
out
long
fourteen
hundred
years
and
you
kept
it
and
your
ancestors
before
you
because
you
were
afraid
it
might
be
used
in
war
he
was
frowning
not
afraid
it
would
be
used
haarland
corrected
gently
we
knew
it
would
be
ross
grimaced
well
why
tell
me
about
it
now
do
you
expect
me
to
keep
it
secret
all
the
rest
of
my
life
i
think
you
would
haarland
said
soberly
but
suppose
i
didn
t
suppose
i
blabbed
all
over
the
galaxy
and
it
was
used
in
war
haarland
s
face
was
suddenly
queerly
gray
he
said
almost
to
himself
it
seems
that
there
are
things
worse
than
abruptly
he
smiled
let
s
find
they
returned
through
the
coupling
and
searched
the
longliner
for
the
old
woman
a
sonny
told
them
ma
usually
hangs
around
the
meter
room
likes
to
see
them
and
there
they
found
her
hello
haarland
she
smiled
flashing
her
superb
teeth
did
you
find
what
you
were
looking
for
perfect
ma
i
want
to
talk
to
you
under
the
she
looked
at
ross
him
she
asked
i
vouch
for
him
haarland
said
gravely
she
answered
the
limiting
velocity
is
but
is
not
a
velocity
haarland
said
he
turned
to
ross
sorry
to
make
a
mystery
he
apologized
it
s
a
recognition
formula
it
identifies
one
member
of
what
we
call
the
wesley
families
or
its
messenger
to
another
and
these
people
are
messengers
they
were
dispatched
a
couple
of
centuries
ago
by
a
wesley
family
whose
ship
for
some
reason
no
longer
could
be
used
why
don
t
know
why
try
your
luck
maybe
you
can
figure
it
out
ma
tell
us
the
history
she
knitted
her
brows
and
began
to
chant
slowly
in
s
time
the
target
was
clyde
rocketry
firm
and
ores
on
the
side
if
we
hadn
t
of
seen
them
direct
we
d
of
missed
em
there
wasn
t
a
blip
from
the
whole
damn
system
that
was
the
first
before
s
day
was
done
we
cut
the
orbit
of
cyrnus
one
the
contact
there
was
trader
mccue
but
the
sons
o
bitches
missed
us
too
that
was
the
second
my
grandpa
lived
to
see
the
green
of
target
three
through
the
screen
but
where
in
hell
was
builder
carruthers
they
let
us
go
by
like
all
the
others
that
was
ma
said
haarland
thanks
very
much
but
would
you
skip
to
the
last
one
ma
grinned
the
haarland
trading
was
last
with
the
fuel
down
low
and
going
fast
i
m
glad
it
was
me
who
saw
the
day
when
they
brought
us
down
on
gca
i
told
him
the
message
he
called
it
a
mystery
but
anyway
this
is
the
end
of
the
history
and
it
s
about
time
the
message
please
haarland
said
broodingly
ma
took
a
deep
breath
and
rattled
off
equals
e
to
the
ross
gaped
that
s
the
message
used
to
be
more
to
it
ma
said
cheerfully
that
s
all
there
is
now
though
the
darn
thing
doesn
t
rhyme
or
anything
i
guess
that
s
the
most
important
part
anyway
it
s
the
it
s
not
as
bad
as
it
seems
haarland
told
ross
i
ve
asked
around
it
makes
a
very
little
it
does
well
up
to
a
point
haarland
qualified
it
seems
to
be
a
formula
in
genetics
the
notation
is
peculiar
but
it
s
all
explained
of
course
it
has
something
to
do
with
gene
loss
now
maybe
that
means
something
and
maybe
it
doesn
t
but
i
know
something
that
does
mean
something
some
member
of
a
wesley
family
a
couple
of
hundred
years
ago
thought
it
was
important
enough
to
want
to
get
it
across
to
other
wesley
families
something
s
happening
let
s
find
out
what
it
is
the
old
man
suddenly
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
in
a
cracked
voice
he
mumbled
gene
loss
and
war
gene
loss
or
war
god
i
wish
somebody
would
take
this
right
out
of
my
that
i
could
drop
with
a
heart
attack
this
minute
you
ever
think
of
war
ross
shocked
and
embarrassed
ross
mumbled
some
kind
of
answer
one
might
think
of
war
good
breeding
taught
but
one
never
talked
about
it
you
should
the
old
man
said
hoarsely
war
is
what
this
secrecy
and
identification
rigmarole
is
all
about
right
now
war
is
solar
systems
anyhow
and
that
s
what
counts
a
planet
might
just
barely
manage
to
fit
an
invading
multigeneration
expedition
at
gigantic
cost
but
it
never
would
the
fruits
of
political
domination
maybe
never
come
back
to
the
fitters
of
the
expedition
but
to
their
remote
descendants
a
firm
will
take
a
flyer
on
a
commercial
deal
like
that
but
no
nation
would
accept
a
war
on
any
such
a
conqueror
is
a
man
and
men
die
with
might
invade
curnus
or
azor
or
any
of
those
other
tempting
dots
on
the
master
maps
why
not
take
the
marginal
population
hop
them
up
with
patriotic
fervor
and
lust
for
booty
and
ship
them
off
to
pillage
and
destroy
there
s
at
least
a
fifty
per
cent
chance
of
coming
out
ahead
on
the
investment
isn
t
there
much
more
attractive
deal
commercially
speaking
than
our
present
ross
had
never
seen
a
war
the
last
on
halsey
s
planet
had
been
the
peninsular
rebellion
about
a
century
and
a
half
ago
some
half
a
million
constitutional
psychopathic
inferiors
had
started
themselves
an
ideal
society
with
theocratic
trimmings
in
a
remote
and
unfruitful
corner
of
the
planet
starved
and
frustrated
by
an
unrealistic
moral
creed
they
finally
exploded
to
devastate
their
neighboring
areas
and
were
quickly
quarantined
by
a
radioactive
zone
they
disintegrated
internally
massacred
their
priesthood
and
were
permitted
to
disperse
it
was
regarded
as
a
shameful
episode
by
every
dweller
on
the
planet
it
wasn
t
a
subject
for
popular
filmreels
if
you
wanted
to
find
out
about
the
peninsular
rebellion
you
went
through
many
successive
library
doors
and
signed
your
name
on
lists
and
were
sternly
questioned
as
to
your
age
and
scholarly
qualifications
and
reasons
for
sniffing
around
such
an
unsavory
mess
ross
therefore
had
not
the
slightest
comprehension
of
haarland
s
anxiety
he
told
him
so
i
hope
you
re
right
was
all
the
old
man
would
say
i
hope
you
don
t
learn
the
rest
was
work
he
had
the
yard
worker
s
familiarity
with
conventional
rocketry
which
saved
him
some
study
of
the
apparatus
of
the
not
much
for
a
week
under
haarland
s
merciless
drilling
he
jetted
the
ship
about
its
remote
area
of
space
far
from
the
commerce
lanes
until
the
old
man
grudgingly
pronounced
himself
satisfied
there
were
sessions
with
the
wesley
drive
or
rather
with
a
first
derivative
of
it
an
object
which
you
could
vaguely
describe
as
a
slide
rule
taller
than
a
man
there
were
main
tracks
analogues
of
the
main
geodesics
of
wesley
they
were
and
whatever
that
was
your
cursor
settings
on
the
main
tracks
depended
on
a
step
computation
based
on
the
apparent
magnitudes
of
the
nearest
celestial
bodies
above
a
certain
mass
which
varied
according
to
yet
another
lengthy
relationship
then
having
cleared
the
preliminaries
out
of
the
way
you
began
to
solve
for
your
actual
setting
on
the
drive
controls
somehow
he
mastered
it
while
haarland
driving
himself
harder
than
he
drove
the
youth
who
was
to
be
his
exploring
eyes
and
ears
coached
him
and
cursed
him
his
own
complicated
affairs
going
back
on
halsey
s
planet
when
ross
had
finally
got
the
theory
of
the
wesley
drive
in
some
kind
of
order
in
his
mind
and
had
learned
all
there
was
to
learn
about
the
other
worlds
and
had
cut
his
few
important
ties
with
halsey
s
planet
he
showed
up
in
haarland
s
office
for
a
final
repetitive
briefing
marconi
was
there
he
had
trouble
meeting
ross
s
eyes
but
his
handclasp
was
firm
and
his
voice
warmly
a
little
envious
the
very
best
ross
he
said
he
hesitated
and
stammered
he
said
in
a
flood
damn
it
i
should
be
going
do
a
good
job
i
hope
you
don
t
hate
and
he
left
while
ross
disturbed
went
in
to
see
old
man
haarland
haarland
spared
no
time
for
sentiment
you
re
cleared
for
space
flight
he
growled
according
to
the
visa
you
re
going
to
case
anyone
asks
you
between
here
and
the
port
actually
let
s
hear
where
you
ross
said
promptly
i
am
going
on
a
mission
of
exploration
and
reconnaissance
my
first
proposed
destination
is
ragansworld
second
gemser
third
azor
if
i
can
not
make
contact
with
any
of
these
three
planets
i
will
select
planets
at
random
from
the
master
charts
until
i
find
some
wesley
drive
families
somewhere
the
contacts
for
the
first
three
planets
are
on
ragansworld
foley
associates
on
gemser
the
franklin
foundation
on
azor
cavallo
machine
tool
company
contacts
on
other
planets
are
listed
in
the
appendix
to
the
master
charts
the
for
ragansworld
skip
the
mumbled
haarland
rubbing
his
eyes
what
do
you
do
when
you
get
in
contact
with
a
wesley
drive
family
ross
hesitated
and
licked
his
lips
it
s
a
little
dammit
roared
haarland
i
ve
told
you
a
yessir
i
know
all
i
meant
was
i
don
t
exactly
understand
what
i
m
looking
if
i
knew
what
you
were
to
look
for
haarland
rasped
i
wouldn
t
have
to
send
you
out
looking
can
t
you
get
it
through
your
thick
head
is
wrong
i
don
t
know
what
maybe
i
m
crazy
for
bothering
about
knows
i
ve
got
troubles
enough
right
we
haarlands
have
a
tradition
of
service
and
maybe
it
s
so
old
that
we
ve
kind
of
forgotten
just
what
it
s
all
about
but
it
s
not
so
old
that
i
ve
forgotten
the
family
tradition
if
i
had
a
son
he
d
be
doing
this
i
counted
on
marconi
to
be
my
son
now
all
i
have
left
is
you
and
that
s
little
enough
heaven
knows
he
finished
bitterly
ross
wounded
said
by
rote
on
landing
i
will
attempt
at
once
to
make
contact
with
the
local
wesley
drive
family
using
the
recognition
codes
given
me
i
will
report
to
them
on
all
the
data
at
hand
and
suggest
the
need
for
haarland
stood
up
all
right
he
said
sorry
i
snapped
at
you
come
on
i
ll
go
up
to
the
ship
with
and
that
was
the
way
it
happened
ross
found
himself
in
the
longliner
then
with
haarland
in
the
tiny
ancient
ship
which
had
once
been
tender
to
the
ship
that
colonized
halsey
s
planet
he
found
himself
shaking
hands
with
a
haarland
watching
him
crawl
through
the
coupling
to
the
longliner
watching
the
longliner
blast
away
he
found
himself
setting
up
the
course
and
throwing
in
the
drive
ross
was
lucky
the
second
listed
inhabited
planet
was
still
inhabited
he
had
not
quite
stopped
shuddering
from
the
first
when
the
approach
radar
caught
him
the
first
planet
was
given
in
the
master
charts
as
ragansworld
pop
diam
mean
orbit
au
and
its
went
on
to
describe
it
as
the
fourth
planet
of
a
small
sun
there
had
been
some
changes
made
the
now
intersected
well
inside
a
bright
and
turbulent
gas
cloud
it
appeared
that
suppressing
the
drive
had
not
quite
annihilated
war
but
the
second
planet
he
was
sure
was
a
world
where
nothing
was
seriously
awry
he
left
the
ship
mumbling
a
name
to
himself
franklin
and
he
was
greeted
by
a
corporal
s
guard
of
dignified
and
ceremonially
dressed
men
they
smiled
at
him
welcomed
him
shook
his
hand
and
invited
him
to
what
seemed
to
be
the
local
equivalent
of
the
administration
building
he
noticed
disapprovingly
that
they
didn
t
seem
to
go
in
for
the
elaborate
decontamination
procedures
of
halsey
s
planet
but
perhaps
he
thought
they
had
bred
into
their
bloodlines
certainly
the
four
men
in
his
guide
party
seemed
hale
and
though
the
youngest
of
them
was
not
less
than
sixty
i
would
like
he
said
to
be
put
in
touch
with
the
franklin
foundation
come
right
in
here
beamed
one
of
the
four
and
another
said
don
t
worry
about
a
they
held
the
door
for
him
and
he
walked
into
a
small
and
sybaritically
furnished
room
the
second
man
said
just
a
few
questions
where
are
you
from
ross
said
simply
halsey
s
planet
and
waited
nothing
happened
except
that
all
four
men
nodded
comprehendingly
and
the
questioner
made
a
mark
on
a
sheet
of
paper
ross
amplified
light
years
away
you
certainly
the
man
said
briskly
your
name
ross
told
him
but
with
a
considerable
feeling
of
deflation
he
thought
wryly
of
his
own
feelings
about
the
longlines
and
the
far
stars
he
remembered
the
stir
and
community
excitement
that
a
starship
meant
back
home
still
ross
told
himself
halsey
s
planet
might
be
just
a
back
eddy
in
the
main
currents
of
civilization
quite
possibly
on
another
one
for
from
the
stars
were
a
commonplace
the
field
hadn
t
seemed
overly
busy
though
and
there
was
nothing
resembling
a
spaceship
thought
with
a
sudden
sense
of
rusting
hulks
clumped
together
at
the
edge
of
the
field
had
once
been
spaceships
but
that
was
hardly
likely
he
reassured
himself
you
just
don
t
let
spaceships
rust
sex
the
man
asked
and
age
education
marital
status
the
questions
went
on
for
more
time
than
ross
quite
understood
and
they
seemed
far
from
relevant
questions
for
the
most
part
and
some
of
them
were
hard
questions
to
answer
tau
quotient
for
instance
ross
blinked
and
said
with
an
edge
to
his
voice
i
don
t
know
what
a
tau
quotient
put
him
down
as
zero
one
of
the
men
advised
and
the
interlocutor
nodded
happily
rating
he
asked
beaming
ross
said
with
controlled
irritation
look
i
don
t
know
anything
about
these
ratings
will
you
take
me
to
somebody
who
can
put
me
in
touch
with
the
franklin
foundation
the
man
who
was
sitting
next
to
him
patted
him
gently
on
the
shoulder
just
answer
the
questions
he
said
comfortably
everything
will
be
all
ross
flared
the
hell
everything
something
with
electrified
spikes
in
it
hit
him
on
the
back
of
the
neck
ross
yelled
and
ducked
away
the
man
next
to
him
returned
a
little
rod
to
his
pocket
he
smiled
at
ross
don
t
feel
bad
he
said
sympathetically
go
ahead
now
answer
the
ross
shook
his
head
dazedly
the
pain
was
already
leaving
his
neck
but
he
felt
nauseated
by
the
suddenness
and
sharpness
of
it
he
could
not
remember
any
pain
quite
like
that
in
his
life
he
stood
up
waveringly
and
said
wait
a
minute
this
time
it
was
the
man
on
the
other
side
and
the
pain
was
about
twice
as
sharp
ross
found
himself
on
the
floor
looking
up
through
a
haze
the
man
on
his
right
kept
the
rod
in
his
hand
and
the
expression
on
his
face
while
in
no
way
angry
was
stern
bad
boy
he
said
tenderly
why
don
t
you
want
to
answer
the
questions
ross
gasped
god
damn
it
all
i
want
is
to
see
somebody
keep
your
dirty
hands
off
me
you
old
fools
and
that
was
a
mistake
as
he
learned
in
the
blessedly
few
minutes
before
he
passed
out
completely
under
the
little
rods
held
by
the
gentle
but
determined
men
he
answered
all
the
to
a
chair
with
two
of
the
men
behind
him
when
he
had
regained
consciousness
he
answered
every
one
they
only
had
to
hit
him
twice
when
they
untied
him
the
next
morning
ross
had
caught
on
to
the
local
folkways
quite
well
the
fatherly
fellow
who
released
him
said
follow
me
and
stood
back
smiling
but
with
one
hand
on
one
of
the
little
rods
and
ross
was
careful
to
say
yes
sir
they
rode
in
a
car
and
entered
a
building
ross
was
left
alone
next
to
a
bed
in
a
dormitory
with
half
a
hundred
beds
just
wait
here
the
man
said
smiling
the
rest
of
your
group
is
out
at
their
morning
session
now
when
they
come
in
for
lunch
you
can
join
them
they
ll
show
you
what
to
ross
didn
t
have
too
long
to
wait
he
spent
the
time
in
conjecture
as
confused
as
it
was
fruitless
he
had
obviously
done
something
wrong
but
just
what
was
it
if
he
had
had
twice
as
long
he
would
have
got
no
farther
toward
an
answer
than
he
was
nowhere
but
a
noise
outside
ended
his
speculations
he
glanced
toward
the
curiously
shaped
the
doors
on
this
planet
seemed
to
be
rectangular
a
girl
of
about
eighteen
was
peering
inside
she
stared
at
ross
and
said
oh
then
she
disappeared
there
were
footsteps
and
whispers
and
more
heads
appeared
and
blinked
at
him
and
were
jerked
back
ross
stood
up
in
wretched
apprehension
all
of
a
sudden
he
was
fourteen
years
old
again
and
entering
a
new
school
where
the
old
hands
were
giggling
and
whispering
about
the
new
boy
he
swore
sullenly
to
himself
a
new
face
appeared
halted
for
an
inspection
of
ross
and
walked
confidently
in
the
man
was
a
good
forty
years
old
ross
thought
perhaps
a
kind
of
overseer
in
this
kind
of
institution
it
was
he
approached
ross
at
a
sedate
pace
and
he
was
followed
through
the
door
in
single
file
by
a
couple
score
men
and
women
they
ranged
in
age
ross
thought
wonderingly
from
the
leader
s
forty
down
to
the
late
teens
of
the
girl
who
had
first
peered
in
the
door
and
now
was
at
the
end
of
the
procession
the
leader
said
how
old
are
you
why
ross
figured
confusedly
this
planet
s
annual
orbital
period
was
roughly
forty
per
cent
longer
than
his
own
fourteen
into
his
age
multiplied
by
ten
making
his
age
in
their
local
calculations
why
i
m
nineteen
of
your
years
old
about
and
a
yes
and
what
can
you
do
look
here
sir
i
ve
been
through
all
this
once
why
don
t
you
go
and
ask
those
gentlemen
who
brought
me
here
and
can
anybody
tell
me
where
the
franklin
foundation
is
the
fortyish
fellow
with
a
look
of
outrage
slapped
ross
across
the
mouth
ross
knocked
him
down
with
a
roundhouse
right
a
girl
yelled
good
for
you
junior
and
jumped
like
a
wildcat
onto
a
slim
lady
clawing
and
slapping
the
throng
dissolved
immediately
into
a
wild
melee
ross
busily
fighting
off
the
fortyish
fellow
and
a
couple
of
his
stocky
buddies
noted
only
that
the
scrap
was
youth
against
age
whatever
it
meant
how
you
a
voice
thundered
and
the
rioters
froze
a
decrepit
wreck
was
standing
in
the
doorway
surrounded
by
three
or
four
gerontological
textbook
cases
only
a
little
less
spavined
than
he
glory
a
girl
muttered
despairingly
it
would
be
the
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
brawl
rolled
from
the
wreck
s
shriveled
lips
in
a
rich
rolled
ross
noted
from
a
flat
perforated
plate
on
his
chest
there
was
a
small
mike
slung
before
his
lips
who
is
responsible
here
asked
the
golden
basso
ross
s
fortyish
assailant
said
humbly
i
am
sir
this
new
fellow
manners
speak
when
you
re
spoken
abjectly
yes
sir
i
m
sorry
silly
fools
the
senile
wreck
hectored
them
i
m
going
to
take
no
official
notice
of
this
since
i
m
merely
passing
through
luckily
for
you
this
is
no
formal
inspection
but
you
ve
lost
your
lunch
hour
with
your
asinine
pranks
now
get
back
to
your
work
and
never
let
me
hear
of
a
disgraceful
incident
like
this
again
from
junior
unit
he
swept
out
with
his
retinue
ross
noted
that
some
of
the
younger
girls
were
crying
and
that
the
older
men
and
women
were
glaring
at
him
murderously
we
ll
teach
you
manners
you
pup
the
said
you
go
on
the
dye
vats
this
afternoon
any
more
trouble
and
you
ll
miss
a
few
ross
told
him
just
keep
your
hands
off
me
the
expanded
into
a
beam
of
pleasure
i
thought
you
d
be
sensible
he
said
everybody
to
the
plant
now
he
collared
a
pretty
girl
of
about
ross
s
age
helena
here
is
working
out
a
bit
of
insolence
on
the
dye
vats
herself
she
ll
show
the
girl
stood
with
downcast
eyes
ross
liked
her
face
and
wondered
about
her
figure
whatever
it
was
like
it
was
covered
from
neck
to
knee
by
a
loose
shirt
but
the
older
women
wore
fitted
clothes
the
led
a
grand
procession
through
the
door
helena
told
ross
i
guess
you
d
better
get
in
front
of
me
in
line
i
go
she
slipped
in
deftly
and
ross
understood
a
little
more
of
what
went
on
here
the
procession
was
in
order
of
age
he
had
determined
to
drift
for
a
day
or
that
he
seemed
to
have
much
choice
the
franklin
foundation
supposedly
having
endured
a
good
many
years
would
last
another
week
while
he
explored
the
baffling
mores
of
this
place
and
found
out
how
to
circumvent
them
and
find
his
way
to
the
keepers
of
on
this
world
nobody
would
go
anywhere
with
his
own
without
first
running
up
a
setting
for
the
wesley
drive
the
line
filed
into
a
factory
whose
like
ross
had
never
before
seen
he
had
a
fair
knowledge
of
and
eye
for
industrial
processes
it
was
clear
that
the
place
was
an
works
but
why
was
the
concrete
floor
dangerously
cracked
and
sloppily
patched
why
was
the
big
enameling
oven
rumbling
and
stinking
why
were
the
rolling
mills
in
a
far
corner
unsupplied
with
guards
and
big
emergency
cutoffs
why
was
the
light
bad
and
the
air
full
of
lint
why
did
the
pickling
tank
fume
and
make
the
workers
around
it
cough
hackingly
most
pointed
of
all
why
did
the
dye
vats
to
which
helena
led
him
stink
and
slop
over
there
were
grimy
signs
everywhere
including
the
isolated
bay
where
braiding
cord
was
dyed
the
standard
code
colors
the
signs
said
things
like
age
is
a
privilege
and
not
a
right
age
must
be
earned
by
work
gratitude
is
the
index
of
your
progress
to
maturity
helena
said
girlishly
as
she
took
his
arm
and
hooked
him
out
of
the
moving
line
here
s
stinkville
believe
me
i
m
not
going
to
talk
back
again
after
all
one
s
maturity
is
measured
by
one
s
acceptance
of
one
s
environment
isn
t
it
yeah
said
ross
listen
helena
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
place
called
the
franklin
foundation
no
she
said
first
you
climb
up
i
don
t
even
know
your
all
right
ross
first
you
climb
up
here
and
make
sure
the
yarn
s
running
over
the
rollers
right
sometimes
it
gets
twisted
around
and
then
it
breaks
then
you
take
one
of
the
thermometers
from
the
wall
and
you
check
the
vat
temperature
it
says
right
on
the
thermometers
what
it
should
be
for
the
different
colors
if
it
s
off
you
turn
that
gas
tap
up
or
down
just
a
little
then
you
check
the
wringer
rolls
where
the
yarn
comes
out
watch
your
fingers
when
you
do
the
yarn
comes
in
different
thicknesses
on
the
same
thread
so
you
have
to
adjust
the
wringer
rolls
so
too
much
dye
doesn
t
get
squeezed
out
you
can
tell
by
the
color
it
shouldn
t
be
lighter
after
it
goes
through
the
rolls
but
the
yarn
shouldn
t
come
through
sloppy
and
drip
dye
on
the
floor
while
it
travels
to
the
there
was
some
more
equally
uncomplicated
he
took
the
yellow
and
green
vats
she
took
the
red
and
blue
they
had
worked
in
the
choking
stench
and
heat
for
perhaps
three
hours
before
ross
finished
one
temperature
check
and
descended
to
adjust
a
gas
tap
he
found
helena
spent
and
gasping
on
the
floor
hidden
from
the
rest
of
the
shop
by
the
bulky
tanks
heat
knock
you
out
he
asked
briskly
don
t
try
to
talk
i
ll
tote
you
over
by
the
wall
away
from
the
burners
maybe
we
ll
catch
a
little
breeze
from
the
windows
she
nodded
weakly
he
picked
her
up
without
too
much
trouble
carried
her
three
yards
or
so
to
the
wall
still
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
shop
she
was
ripely
curved
under
that
loose
shirt
he
learned
he
set
her
down
easily
crouching
himself
and
did
not
take
his
hands
away
it
s
been
a
long
time
he
she
was
responding
whether
she
knew
it
or
not
there
was
a
drowsy
smile
on
her
face
and
her
body
moved
a
little
against
his
hands
pleasurably
she
was
breathing
harder
ross
did
the
sensible
thing
and
kissed
her
wildcat
ross
reeled
back
from
her
fright
and
anger
his
face
copiously
scratched
i
m
dreadfully
sorry
he
sputtered
please
accept
my
the
of
rage
ended
she
was
sobbing
bitterly
leaning
against
the
wall
wailing
that
nobody
had
ever
treated
her
like
that
before
that
she
d
be
set
back
three
years
if
he
told
anybody
that
she
was
a
good
girl
and
he
had
no
to
treat
her
that
way
and
what
kind
of
degenerate
was
he
not
yet
twenty
and
going
around
kissing
girls
when
knew
you
went
crazy
from
it
he
soothed
a
distance
her
sobbing
dropped
to
a
bilious
croon
as
she
climbed
the
ladder
to
the
yellow
vat
tears
still
on
her
face
and
checked
its
temperature
ross
wondering
if
he
were
already
crazy
from
too
much
kissing
of
girls
mechanically
resumed
his
duties
but
she
had
responded
and
how
long
had
they
been
working
and
wasn
t
this
shift
ever
going
to
end
all
the
shifts
ended
in
time
but
there
was
a
catch
to
it
there
was
always
another
shift
after
the
afternoon
shift
on
the
dye
vats
came
then
came
the
evening
shift
on
the
dye
vats
and
then
sleep
the
foreman
was
lenient
though
he
let
ross
off
the
vats
after
the
end
of
the
second
day
then
it
was
kitchen
orderly
and
only
two
shifts
a
day
and
besides
you
got
plenty
to
eat
but
it
was
a
long
long
way
ross
thought
sardonically
to
himself
from
the
shining
pictures
he
had
painted
to
himself
back
on
halsey
s
planet
ross
the
explorer
ross
the
hero
ross
the
savior
of
humanity
ross
the
semipermanent
kp
he
had
to
admit
it
to
himself
the
expedition
thus
far
had
been
a
bust
not
only
was
it
perfectly
clear
that
there
no
longer
was
a
franklin
foundation
on
gemser
but
more
had
been
lost
than
time
and
effort
for
ross
himself
he
silently
admitted
was
as
close
to
lost
as
he
ever
wanted
to
be
he
was
in
effect
a
prisoner
in
a
prison
from
which
there
was
no
easy
escape
as
long
as
he
was
cursed
with
youthfulness
of
course
the
implications
of
that
were
that
there
was
a
perfectly
easy
escape
in
time
all
he
had
to
do
was
get
old
enough
to
matter
on
this
insane
planet
ninety
maybe
and
then
he
would
be
perfectly
free
to
totter
out
to
the
spaceport
dragoon
a
squad
of
juniors
into
lifting
him
into
the
ship
and
take
off
helena
was
some
help
but
only
psychologically
she
was
pleasant
company
but
neither
she
nor
anyone
else
in
the
roster
of
to
whom
he
was
permitted
to
speak
had
ever
heard
of
the
franklin
foundation
or
travel
or
anything
helena
said
wait
for
holiday
maybe
one
of
the
grownups
will
tell
you
then
holiday
ross
slid
back
and
scratched
his
shoulder
blades
against
the
corner
of
his
bed
helena
was
sprawled
on
the
floor
half
watching
a
projected
picture
on
the
screen
at
the
end
of
the
dormitory
yes
you
re
lucky
it
s
only
eight
days
off
that
s
when
she
pointed
to
the
graduates
he
s
the
only
one
this
year
and
we
all
move
up
a
step
and
the
new
classes
come
in
and
then
we
all
get
everything
we
want
well
pretty
near
she
amended
we
can
t
do
anything
but
you
ll
see
it
s
then
the
picture
ended
and
it
was
calisthenics
time
and
then
lights
out
men
and
women
on
their
honor
system
appeared
to
work
beautifully
there
had
been
no
signs
of
sex
play
that
ross
had
been
able
to
the
sleep
of
the
innocent
while
ross
the
lay
staring
into
the
dark
with
rising
hope
in
the
kitchen
the
next
morning
he
got
more
information
from
helena
holiday
seemed
to
be
a
cross
between
saturnalia
and
boy
s
week
for
one
day
of
the
year
the
elders
slightly
relaxed
their
grip
on
the
reins
on
that
day
alone
one
could
speak
before
being
spoken
to
interrupt
one
s
elders
even
leave
the
room
without
being
excused
whee
ross
thought
sourly
but
still
the
foreman
dobermann
once
you
learned
how
to
handle
him
wasn
t
such
a
bad
guy
ross
studying
his
habits
learned
the
proper
approach
and
used
it
dobermann
s
commonest
complaint
was
of
when
some
junior
was
caught
sneaking
into
line
ahead
of
his
proper
place
irresponsibility
when
ross
forgot
to
make
his
bed
before
stumbling
out
in
the
dark
to
his
kitchen
shift
one
awful
case
of
irresponsibility
when
helena
thoughtlessly
poured
cold
water
into
the
cooking
vat
while
it
was
turned
on
there
was
a
sizzle
a
crackle
and
a
puff
of
steam
and
helena
was
weeping
over
a
broken
heating
element
dobermann
came
storming
over
and
ross
saw
his
chance
that
is
very
irresponsible
of
you
helena
he
said
coldly
back
to
dobermann
but
entirely
conscious
of
his
presence
if
junior
unit
was
all
as
irresponsible
as
you
it
would
reflect
badly
on
dobermann
you
don
t
know
how
lucky
you
are
that
dobermann
is
so
kind
to
helena
s
weeping
dried
up
instantly
she
gave
ross
one
furious
glance
and
lowered
her
eyes
before
dobermann
dobermann
nodded
approvingly
to
ross
as
he
waded
into
helena
it
was
a
memorable
tirade
but
ross
heard
only
part
of
it
he
was
looking
at
the
cooking
vat
it
was
a
bit
of
construction
a
spiral
of
resistance
wire
around
a
ceramic
core
the
core
had
cracked
and
one
end
of
the
wire
was
loose
if
it
could
be
reconnected
the
cracked
core
shouldn
t
matter
wire
was
covered
with
insulation
anyhow
he
looked
up
and
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
then
remembered
and
merely
stood
looking
brightly
attentive
like
you
want
to
go
back
to
the
vats
the
foreman
was
finishing
well
helena
if
that
s
what
you
want
we
can
make
you
happy
this
time
you
ll
be
by
yourself
too
you
won
t
have
ross
to
help
you
out
when
the
going
s
rough
will
she
ross
no
sir
ross
said
immediately
sir
dobermann
looked
back
at
him
frowning
what
i
think
i
can
fix
this
ross
said
modestly
dobermann
s
eyes
bulged
fix
it
yes
sir
it
s
only
a
loose
wire
back
where
i
come
from
we
all
learned
how
to
take
care
of
things
like
that
when
we
were
still
in
school
it
s
just
a
matter
now
hold
on
ross
the
foreman
howled
tampering
with
a
machine
is
bad
enough
but
if
you
re
going
to
turn
out
to
be
a
liar
too
you
re
going
just
too
far
school
indeed
you
know
perfectly
well
ross
that
even
i
won
t
be
ready
for
school
until
after
holiday
ross
i
knew
you
were
a
troublemaker
knew
it
the
first
day
i
set
eyes
on
you
school
well
we
ll
see
how
you
like
the
school
i
m
going
to
send
you
to
the
vats
weren
t
so
bad
the
second
time
even
though
the
porridge
was
cold
for
two
days
until
somebody
got
around
to
delivering
a
different
though
equally
cooking
vat
helena
passed
out
from
the
heat
three
times
and
when
on
the
third
time
ross
goaded
beyond
endurance
kissed
her
again
there
were
no
hysterics
from
birth
to
puberty
you
were
an
infant
from
puberty
to
dobermann
s
age
a
junior
for
ten
years
after
that
you
went
to
school
learning
the
things
you
had
neither
the
need
nor
the
right
to
know
before
and
then
you
were
of
age
being
of
age
meant
much
much
more
than
voting
ross
found
out
for
one
thing
it
meant
freedom
to
the
enforced
sexlessness
of
the
junior
years
and
the
directed
breeding
via
artificial
insemination
of
the
scholars
it
meant
a
healthy
head
start
on
seniority
which
carried
with
it
all
offices
and
all
power
it
meant
freedom
as
a
bare
beginning
it
meant
the
freedom
to
command
any
number
of
juniors
or
scholars
on
ross
s
last
punitive
day
in
the
dye
vats
a
happy
ancient
commandeered
the
entire
staff
to
help
set
shrubs
in
his
front
good
dozen
acres
of
careful
landscaping
it
was
and
the
prettiest
sight
ross
had
seen
on
this
ugly
planet
when
they
got
back
to
the
dye
vats
the
yellow
and
blue
had
boiled
over
and
broken
strands
of
yarn
had
fouled
all
the
bobbins
dobermann
the
juniors
but
then
dobermann
s
raging
came
to
an
end
forever
it
was
the
night
before
holiday
and
there
was
a
pretty
ceremony
as
he
packed
his
kit
and
got
ready
to
turn
junior
unit
over
to
his
successor
everyone
was
scrubbed
and
though
a
certain
amount
of
license
in
regard
to
neatness
was
allowed
between
dinner
and
lights
out
each
bunk
was
made
and
carefully
smoothed
free
of
wrinkles
after
half
an
hour
of
fidgety
waiting
dobermann
attention
and
the
minister
came
in
with
his
ancient
retinue
the
rich
mechanical
voice
boomed
out
from
his
breastplate
junior
dobermann
today
you
are
a
man
dobermann
stood
with
his
head
bowed
silent
and
content
junior
unit
chanted
antiphonally
junior
dobermann
the
retinue
took
three
steps
forward
and
the
minister
boomed
beauty
comes
with
age
age
is
beauty
and
the
chorus
old
heads
are
wisest
ross
standing
as
straight
as
any
of
them
faked
the
words
with
his
lips
and
tongue
and
wondered
how
many
repetitions
had
drilled
those
sentiments
into
junior
unit
there
were
five
more
chants
and
five
responses
and
then
the
minister
and
his
court
of
four
were
standing
next
to
dobermann
breathing
heavily
from
his
exertions
the
minister
reached
behind
him
and
took
a
book
from
the
hands
of
the
nearest
of
his
retinue
he
said
panting
scholar
dobermann
in
the
book
lies
the
words
of
the
fathers
read
them
and
the
chorus
cried
thrice
the
word
of
the
fathers
is
and
then
the
minister
touched
dobermann
s
hand
and
in
solemn
silence
left
as
soon
as
the
elders
had
gone
the
juniors
flocked
around
dobermann
to
wish
him
well
there
was
excited
laughter
in
the
congratulations
and
a
touch
of
apprehension
too
dobermann
with
all
his
faults
was
a
known
quantity
and
the
members
of
junior
unit
were
beginning
to
look
a
little
fearfully
at
the
short
redheaded
youth
who
from
the
next
day
on
would
be
dobermann
s
successor
ross
promised
himself
he
can
be
good
or
bad
a
blessing
or
a
problem
but
he
won
t
be
problem
i
m
getting
out
of
here
tomorrow
holiday
oh
it
s
fun
helena
told
him
enthusiastically
first
you
get
up
early
to
get
the
voting
out
of
the
voting
sure
don
t
they
vote
where
you
come
from
i
thought
everybody
voted
that
s
democracy
like
we
have
it
he
sardonically
quoted
one
of
the
omnipresent
wall
signs
the
happiness
of
the
majority
means
the
happiness
of
the
he
had
often
wondered
what
if
anything
it
meant
but
helena
solemnly
nodded
they
were
whispering
from
their
adjoining
cots
by
dim
false
dawn
filtering
through
the
windows
on
holiday
morning
they
were
not
the
only
whisperers
things
were
relaxing
already
ross
helena
said
yes
i
thought
maybe
you
might
not
know
on
holiday
if
you
ah
want
to
do
that
again
you
don
t
have
to
wait
until
i
faint
ah
of
course
you
don
t
do
it
right
out
in
the
overcome
by
her
own
daring
she
buried
her
head
under
the
coarse
blanket
fine
thought
ross
wearily
once
a
did
holiday
come
once
a
year
kids
were
allowed
to
play
spin
the
no
doubt
their
elders
thought
it
was
too
cute
for
words
mere
tots
of
thirty
and
childishly
and
innocently
experimenting
with
sex
of
course
it
would
be
discreetly
supervised
so
that
nobody
would
get
in
trouble
he
was
quite
sure
helena
s
last
two
faints
had
been
unconvincing
phonies
the
whistle
blew
at
last
the
chattering
members
of
junior
unit
dawdled
while
they
dressed
and
the
new
foreman
indulgently
passed
out
shabby
smutted
ribbons
which
the
girls
tied
in
their
hair
they
had
sugar
on
their
mush
for
breakfast
and
ross
s
stomach
came
near
turning
as
he
heard
burbles
of
gratitude
at
the
feast
with
pushing
and
a
certain
amount
of
inexpert
horseplay
they
formed
a
column
of
fours
and
hiked
from
the
the
whole
factory
complex
indeed
along
a
rubberized
highway
once
you
got
out
of
the
factory
area
things
became
pleasanter
by
the
mile
hortatory
roadside
signs
thinned
out
and
vanished
stinking
middens
of
industrial
waste
were
left
behind
and
then
the
landscape
was
rolling
sodded
acres
with
the
road
pleasantly
springy
underfoot
the
air
clean
and
crisp
they
oohed
and
aahed
at
houses
glimpsed
occasionally
in
the
rambling
affairs
that
looked
once
a
car
overhauled
them
on
the
highway
and
slowed
to
a
crawl
it
was
a
huge
thing
richly
upholstered
within
a
pair
of
grimlooking
youths
were
respectively
chauffeur
and
footman
the
passenger
waved
at
the
troop
from
junior
and
grinned
out
of
a
fantastic
landscape
of
wrinkles
ross
gaped
had
he
thought
the
visiting
minister
was
old
this
creature
male
or
female
was
after
the
car
sped
on
to
the
cheers
of
the
marchers
there
was
happy
twittering
speculation
junior
didn
t
recognize
the
citizen
who
had
graciously
waved
to
them
but
they
thought
she
wonderful
so
dignified
so
distinguished
so
learned
so
gracious
so
democratic
wasn
t
it
sweet
of
him
helena
burbled
and
i
m
sure
he
must
be
somebody
important
connected
with
the
voting
otherwise
he
d
just
vote
from
ross
s
feet
were
beginning
to
hurt
when
they
reached
the
suburban
center
to
the
best
of
his
recollection
they
were
no
more
than
eight
or
ten
kilos
from
the
field
and
his
starship
backtrack
on
the
road
to
the
suburban
center
about
three
kilos
take
the
fork
to
the
right
and
that
would
be
that
junior
reached
a
pitch
of
marveling
at
the
low
spacious
buildings
of
the
center
through
sweeping
transparent
windows
they
saw
acres
of
food
and
clothing
in
the
shopping
center
the
theater
was
an
architectural
miracle
the
civic
center
almost
finished
them
off
with
its
statue
of
equal
justice
under
the
law
a
dignified
beldame
whose
chin
and
nose
almost
met
leaning
on
a
crutch
and
civic
virtue
in
a
motorized
wheelchair
equipped
with
an
emergency
oxygen
tent
auxiliary
blood
pump
and
an
artificial
kidney
merry
oldsters
were
everywhere
in
their
cars
and
wheelchairs
gaily
waving
at
the
kids
only
one
untoward
incident
marred
their
prevoting
tour
of
inspection
a
young
man
mistakenly
called
out
a
cheerful
life
and
wisdom
ma
am
to
a
beaming
oldster
ma
am
is
it
the
oldster
roared
through
his
throat
mike
and
amplifier
in
an
unmistakable
baritone
i
ll
ma
am
you
you
wise
punk
he
spun
his
wheelchair
on
a
decishield
threw
it
into
high
and
roared
down
on
the
offender
running
him
over
the
boy
covered
himself
as
well
as
he
could
while
the
raging
old
man
backed
over
him
again
and
ran
over
him
again
his
ordeal
ended
when
the
oldster
collapsed
forward
in
the
chair
hanging
from
his
safety
belt
the
boy
got
up
with
tire
marks
on
him
and
groaned
oh
lord
i
ve
hurt
he
appealed
hysterically
what
ll
i
do
is
he
dead
another
senior
citizen
buzzed
up
and
snapped
cut
in
his
heart
you
booby
the
boy
turned
on
the
pump
trembling
the
juniors
of
watched
as
the
tubes
to
the
oldster
s
left
arm
throbbed
and
pulsed
a
massive
sigh
went
up
when
the
old
man
s
eyes
opened
and
he
sat
up
groggily
what
happened
you
died
again
sherrington
said
the
other
elder
third
time
this
thing
there
was
a
responsible
person
around
now
get
over
to
the
medical
center
this
minute
and
have
a
complete
checkup
hear
me
yes
dad
sherrington
said
weakly
he
rolled
off
in
low
gear
his
father
turned
to
the
youngster
who
stood
vacantly
rubbing
the
tire
marks
on
his
face
since
it
s
holiday
he
grated
i
ll
let
this
pass
on
any
other
day
i
would
have
seen
to
it
that
you
were
set
back
fifteen
years
for
your
disgraceful
ross
knew
by
then
what
that
meant
and
shuddered
with
the
rest
it
amounted
to
a
death
sentence
did
fifteen
additional
years
of
the
grinding
toil
and
marginal
diet
of
a
junior
somewhat
dampened
they
proceeded
to
the
hall
of
democracy
a
glittering
place
replete
with
slogans
statues
and
heroic
portraits
of
the
heroic
aged
huddled
together
as
it
joined
with
a
stream
of
juniors
from
the
area
s
other
factory
units
most
of
them
were
larger
than
the
cable
works
many
of
them
apparently
involved
more
wearing
and
hazardous
occupations
some
groups
coughed
incessantly
and
were
from
the
irritation
of
some
chemical
others
must
have
been
specialists
they
were
divided
into
the
hale
whose
muscles
bulged
amazingly
and
the
and
women
who
obviously
could
not
take
the
work
but
who
were
doing
it
anyway
they
seated
themselves
at
long
benches
with
push
buttons
at
each
station
helena
next
to
him
explained
the
system
to
ross
voting
was
universal
and
simultaneous
in
all
the
halls
of
democracy
around
the
planet
and
from
all
the
homes
of
the
senior
citizens
who
did
not
choose
to
vote
from
a
hall
simultaneously
the
votes
were
counted
at
a
central
station
and
the
results
were
flashed
to
screens
in
the
centers
and
homes
she
said
a
number
of
enthusiastic
things
about
democracy
while
ross
studied
a
sheet
on
which
the
candidates
and
propositions
were
listed
the
names
meant
nothing
to
him
he
noted
only
that
each
of
three
candidates
for
chief
of
state
was
one
hundred
thirty
years
old
that
each
of
three
candidates
for
first
assistant
chief
was
one
hundred
and
years
old
and
so
on
obviously
the
nominating
conventions
by
agreement
named
candidates
of
the
same
age
for
each
office
to
keep
it
a
contest
proposition
one
read
to
dismantle
seven
pediatric
centers
and
apply
the
salvage
value
to
the
construction
of
and
the
funds
no
longer
required
for
their
maintenance
to
the
maintenance
of
a
new
wing
of
the
gerontological
center
said
wing
to
be
devoted
to
basic
research
in
the
extension
of
human
proposition
two
was
worse
ross
didn
t
bother
to
read
the
rest
of
them
he
whispered
hoarsely
to
helena
what
next
ssh
she
pointed
to
a
screen
at
the
front
of
the
hall
it
s
a
senior
citizen
of
a
very
high
rank
his
face
was
entirely
hidden
by
an
oxygen
mask
was
speaking
from
the
screen
there
was
what
seemed
to
be
a
ritual
speech
of
invocation
then
he
got
down
to
business
citizens
he
said
through
his
throat
mike
behold
democracy
in
action
i
give
you
three
candidates
for
chief
of
them
over
and
make
up

applause
boomed
louder
some
of
the
younger
juniors
yelled
hysterically
and
drummed
their
heels
on
the
floor
helena
was
panting
with
excitement
eyes
bright
on
the
screen
isn
t
it
she
gasped
ecstatically
oh
look
at
him
was
the
third
candidate
and
the
first
oldster
ross
had
seen
whose
gocart
was
a
wheeled
stretcher
prone
and
almost
invisible
through
the
clusters
of
tubing
and
chromed
equipment
senior
citizen
immanuel
appleby
acknowledged
his
age
one
century
three
decades
eleven
months
and
five
days
the
crowd
went
mad
helena
broke
from
ross
s
side
and
joined
a
long
yelling
snake
dance
through
the
corridors
ross
yelled
experimentally
as
protective
coloration
then
found
himself
yelling
because
everybody
was
yelling
because
he
couldn
t
help
it
by
the
time
the
speaker
on
the
screen
began
to
call
for
order
ross
was
standing
on
top
of
the
voting
bench
and
screaming
his
head
off
helena
weeping
with
excitement
tugged
at
his
leg
vote
now
ross
she
begged
and
all
over
the
hall
the
cry
was
vote
vote
ross
reached
out
for
the
voting
buttons
what
do
we
do
now
he
asked
helena
push
the
button
marked
appleby
of
course
hurry
but
why
appleby
ross
objected
that
fellow
flexner
for
hush
ross
somebody
might
be
there
was
sickening
fright
on
helena
s
face
didn
t
you
hear
we
to
vote
for
the
best
man
oldest
is
bestest
you
know
that
s
what
democracy
the
freedom
of
choice
they
read
us
the
ages
and
we
choose
which
is
oldest
now
please
ross
hurry
before
somebody
starts
asking
questions
the
voting
was
over
and
the
best
man
had
won
in
every
case
it
was
a
triumph
for
informed
public
opinion
the
mob
poured
out
of
the
hall
in
order
all
precedences
and
formalities
suspended
for
holiday
helena
grasped
ross
firmly
by
the
arm
the
crowd
was
spreading
over
the
quiet
acres
surrounding
the
center
each
little
cluster
heedlessly
intent
on
a
project
of
its
own
under
the
pressure
of
helena
s
arm
ross
found
himself
swerving
toward
a
clump
of
shrubbery
he
said
violently
no
that
is
i
mean
i
m
sorry
helena
but
i
ve
got
something
to
she
stared
at
him
with
shock
in
her
eyes
on
holiday
on
holiday
truly
helena
i
m
sorry
look
what
you
said
last
now
till
tomorrow
morning
i
can
do
what
i
want
right
sullenly
yes
i
ross
that
i
he
jerked
his
arm
away
feeling
like
all
of
the
hundred
possible
kinds
of
a
skunk
see
you
around
he
said
over
his
shoulder
he
did
not
look
back
three
kilos
back
he
told
himself
firmly
then
the
fork
in
the
road
and
not
more
than
a
dozen
kilos
at
the
most
to
the
spaceport
he
could
do
it
in
a
couple
of
hours
one
thing
had
been
established
for
certain
if
ever
there
had
been
a
franklin
foundation
on
this
planet
it
was
gone
for
good
now
dismantled
no
doubt
to
provide
building
materials
for
an
eartrumpet
plant
no
doubt
the
little
ship
that
the
franklin
foundation
was
supposed
to
cover
for
was
still
swinging
in
an
orbit
within
easy
range
of
the
spaceport
but
the
chance
that
anybody
would
ever
find
it
or
use
it
if
found
was
pretty
close
to
zero
if
they
bothered
to
maintain
a
radar
watch
at
other
watch
than
the
fully
automatic
one
set
to
respond
only
to
highvelocity
interstellar
if
anyone
ever
took
time
to
look
at
the
radar
plot
no
doubt
the
ship
was
charted
as
an
asteroid
satellite
derelict
or
body
of
unknown
certainly
no
one
of
these
smug
oldsters
would
take
the
trouble
to
investigate
the
only
problem
to
solve
on
this
planet
was
how
to
get
off
on
the
road
ahead
of
him
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
combination
sex
orgy
and
it
rolled
in
a
yelling
milling
mob
of
half
a
hundred
excited
juniors
across
the
road
toward
him
then
swerved
into
the
fields
as
a
cluster
of
screaming
women
broke
free
and
ran
and
the
rest
of
the
crowd
roared
after
them
ross
quickened
his
step
if
he
ever
did
get
off
this
planet
it
would
have
to
be
today
he
was
not
fool
enough
to
think
that
any
ordinary
day
would
give
him
the
freedom
to
poke
around
the
spaceport
s
defenses
and
it
would
be
just
his
luck
he
thought
bitterly
to
get
involved
in
a
gang
fight
on
the
way
to
the
port
there
was
a
squeal
of
tires
behind
him
and
a
little
vehicle
screeched
to
a
halt
ross
threw
up
a
defensive
arm
in
automatic
reflex
but
it
was
only
helena
awkwardly
fumbling
open
the
door
of
the
car
get
in
she
said
sourly
you
ve
spoiled
holiday
might
as
well
do
what
want
to
what
s
that
helena
looked
where
he
was
pointing
and
shrugged
guard
box
she
guessed
how
would
i
know
nobody
s
in
it
ross
nodded
they
had
abandoned
the
car
and
were
standing
outside
a
long
seamless
fence
that
surrounded
the
spaceport
the
main
gates
were
closed
and
locked
a
few
hundred
feet
to
the
right
was
a
smaller
gate
with
a
sort
of
pillbox
but
that
had
every
appearance
of
being
locked
too
all
right
said
ross
see
that
shed
with
the
boxes
outside
it
over
we
the
shed
was
right
up
against
the
fence
the
metal
boxes
gave
a
sort
of
rough
and
just
barely
climbable
foothold
helena
was
easy
enough
to
lift
to
the
top
of
the
shed
ross
grunting
managed
to
clamber
after
her
they
looked
down
at
the
ground
on
the
other
side
a
dozen
feet
away
you
don
t
have
to
come
along
ross
told
her
that
s
just
you
she
flared
cast
me
on
me
all
right
all
ross
looked
around
but
neither
junior
nor
elder
was
anywhere
in
sight
hang
by
your
hands
and
then
drop
he
advised
her
get
moving
before
somebody
shows
on
holiday
she
asked
bitterly
she
squirmed
over
the
narrow
top
of
the
fence
legs
dangling
let
herself
down
as
far
as
she
could
and
let
go
ross
watched
anxiously
but
she
got
up
quickly
enough
and
moved
to
one
side
ross
plopped
down
next
to
her
knocking
the
wind
out
of
himself
he
got
up
dizzily
his
ship
in
lonesome
quiet
was
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
let
s
go
ross
panted
and
clutched
her
hand
they
skirted
another
shed
and
were
in
the
clear
running
as
fast
as
they
could
almost
in
the
clear
ross
heard
the
whine
of
the
little
scooter
before
he
felt
the
blow
but
it
was
too
late
he
sprawled
on
the
ground
dragging
helena
after
him
a
senior
citizen
with
a
rod
of
the
sort
ross
remembered
all
too
well
was
scowling
down
at
them
children
he
rumbled
through
his
in
a
voice
of
awful
disgust
is
this
the
way
to
act
on
holiday
helena
gibbering
in
terror
was
beyond
words
ross
croaked
sorry
sir
were
crash
the
rod
came
down
again
and
every
muscle
in
ross
s
body
convulsed
he
rolled
helplessly
away
the
elder
following
him
crash
we
give
you
holiday
the
elder
boomed
crash
act
like
animals
terrible
don
t
you
know
that
freedom
of
play
on
crash
the
most
sacred
right
of
every
crash
heaven
help
crash
you
abuse
it
the
wrenching
punishment
and
the
caressing
voice
stopped
together
ross
lay
blinking
into
the
terrible
silence
that
followed
he
became
conscious
of
helena
s
weeping
and
forced
his
head
to
turn
to
look
at
her
she
was
standing
behind
the
elder
s
scooter
a
length
of
wire
in
her
hand
the
senior
lay
slumped
against
his
safety
strap
ross
she
moaned
ross
what
have
i
done
turned
him
off
he
stood
up
coughing
and
retching
no
one
else
was
in
sight
only
the
two
of
them
and
the
silent
slack
form
of
the
old
man
he
grabbed
her
arm
come
on
he
said
fuzzily
and
started
toward
the
starship
she
hung
back
mumbling
to
herself
her
eyes
saucers
she
was
in
a
state
of
grievous
shock
it
was
clear
ross
hesitated
rubbing
his
back
he
knew
that
she
might
never
pull
out
of
it
even
if
she
did
she
was
certain
to
be
a
frightful
handicap
but
it
was
that
she
had
declared
herself
on
his
side
even
if
the
elder
could
be
revived
the
punishment
in
store
for
helena
would
be
awful
to
contemplate
come
what
may
he
was
now
responsible
for
helena
he
towed
her
to
the
starship
she
climbed
in
docilely
enough
sat
staring
blankly
as
he
sealed
ship
and
sent
it
blasting
off
the
face
of
the
planet
she
didn
t
speak
until
they
were
well
into
deep
space
then
the
blank
stare
abruptly
clouded
and
she
exploded
in
a
fit
of
tears
ross
said
ineffectually
there
it
had
no
effect
until
in
its
own
time
the
storm
ended
helena
said
hoarsely
do
i
do
now
why
i
guess
you
come
right
along
with
me
ross
said
heartily
cursing
his
luck
where
s
that
where
you
mean
where
ross
scratched
his
head
well
let
s
see
frankly
helena
your
planet
was
quite
a
disappointment
to
me
i
had
no
matter
i
suppose
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
look
up
the
next
planet
on
the
what
list
ross
hesitated
then
shrugged
and
plunged
into
the
explanation
all
about
the
longliners
and
the
message
and
travel
and
the
wesley
none
of
it
while
he
was
talking
seemed
convincing
at
all
but
perhaps
helena
was
less
critical
or
perhaps
helena
simply
did
not
care
she
listened
attentively
and
made
no
comment
she
only
said
at
the
end
what
s
the
name
of
the
next
planet
he
consulted
the
master
charts
haarland
s
listing
showed
a
place
called
azor
conveniently
near
at
hand
in
the
strange
geodesics
of
the
wesley
effect
where
the
far
galaxies
might
be
near
at
hand
in
the
warped
and
the
void
just
beyond
the
viewplates
be
infinitely
distant
the
family
of
azor
was
named
cavallo
when
last
heard
from
they
had
been
builders
of
machine
tools
ross
told
helena
about
it
she
shrugged
and
watched
curiously
as
he
began
to
set
up
the
problem
on
the
huge
board
they
were
well
within
detection
range
of
azor
s
radar
if
any
and
yet
there
had
been
no
beeping
signal
that
the
planet
s
gca
had
taken
over
and
would
pilot
them
down
another
blank
he
studied
the
surface
of
the
world
under
his
highest
magnification
and
saw
no
signs
that
it
had
been
devastated
by
war
there
were
as
far
as
he
could
tell
but
not
very
attractive
the
design
ran
to
huge
gloomy
piles
that
mounted
toward
central
towers
azor
was
a
big
world
which
showed
not
much
water
and
a
great
deal
of
black
rock
it
was
the
fifth
of
its
system
and
reportedly
had
colonized
its
four
adjacent
neighbors
and
their
moons
his
own
search
radar
pinged
the
signal
was
followed
at
once
by
a
guarded
voice
from
his
communicator
what
ship
are
you
do
you
receive
me
the
band
is
he
hastily
dialed
the
frequency
on
his
transmitter
and
called
i
receive
you
we
are
a
vessel
from
outside
your
solar
system
home
planet
halsey
we
want
to
contact
a
family
named
cavallo
of
the
planet
azor
believed
to
be
engaged
in
building
machine
tools
can
you
help
us
you
are
a
male
the
voice
asked
cautiously
in
command
or
simply
the
communicator
i
m
a
male
and
i
m
in
command
of
this
the
voice
said
then
sheer
off
this
system
and
go
elsewhere
my
what
is
this
who
are
you
my
name
does
not
matter
i
happen
to
be
on
watch
aboard
the
prison
orbital
station
get
going
my
friend
before
the
planetary
gca
picks
you
prison
orbital
station
a
very
sensible
idea
thanks
for
the
advice
he
parried
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
the
cavallo
family
i
have
heard
of
them
my
friend
your
time
is
running
out
if
you
do
not
sheer
off
very
soon
they
will
land
you
and
i
judge
from
the
tone
of
your
voice
that
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
join
the
rest
of
us
criminals
aboard
it
is
not
pleasant
here
wait
please
ross
had
no
intention
at
all
of
committing
any
crimes
that
would
land
him
aboard
a
prison
hulk
and
he
had
every
intention
of
fulfilling
his
mission
tell
me
about
the
cavallo
why
you
expect
me
to
get
in
trouble
on
the
time
is
running
out
my
friend
cavallo
family
of
machine
tool
builders
is
located
in
novj
grad
and
the
crime
of
which
all
of
us
aboard
minerva
were
convicted
is
conspiracy
to
advocate
equality
of
the
sexes
now
go
the
hum
of
the
communicator
died
but
immediately
there
was
another
electronic
noise
to
fill
the
beep
of
a
gca
radar
taking
over
the
sealed
landing
controls
of
the
craft
helena
had
been
listening
with
very
little
comprehension
who
was
your
friend
ross
she
asked
where
are
we
i
think
ross
said
he
my
friend
and
i
think
we
the
ship
began
to
jet
tentative
bursts
of
reaction
mass
nosing
toward
the
big
gloomy
planet
that
s
all
right
helena
said
comfortably
at
least
they
won
t
know
i
disconnected
a
senior
she
thought
a
moment
they
won
t
will
they
i
mean
the
senior
citizens
here
won
t
know
about
the
senior
citizens
there
will
they
he
tried
to
break
it
to
her
gently
as
the
ship
picked
up
speed
helena
it
s
possible
that
the
old
people
here
won
t
be
senior
in
your
planet
s
sense
they
may
just
be
old
people
with
no
special
authority
over
young
people
i
think
in
fact
that
we
may
find
you
outranking
older
people
who
happen
to
be
she
took
it
as
a
joke
you
are
funny
ross
old
means
senior
doesn
t
it
and
senior
means
better
wiser
abler
and
in
charge
doesn
t
it
we
ll
see
he
said
thoughtfully
as
the
main
reaction
drive
cut
in
we
ll
see
very
the
spaceport
was
bustling
busy
and
efficient
ross
marveled
at
the
speed
and
dexterity
with
which
the
anonymous
ground
operator
whipped
his
ship
into
a
braking
orbit
and
set
it
down
and
he
stared
enviously
at
the
crawling
clamshells
on
treads
bigger
than
houses
that
cupped
around
his
ship
the
ship
was
completely
and
hermetically
surrounded
and
bathed
in
a
mist
of
germicides
and
prophylactic
rays
a
helmeted
figure
riding
a
little
platform
on
the
inside
of
one
of
the
clamshells
turned
a
series
of
knobs
climbed
down
and
rapped
on
the
ship
s
entrance
port
ross
opened
it
diffidently
and
almost
strangled
in
the
antiseptic
fumes
helena
choked
and
wheezed
behind
him
as
the
figure
threw
back
its
helmet
and
said
where
s
the
captain
i
am
he
said
ross
meticulously
i
would
like
to
be
put
in
touch
with
the
cavallo
company
of
novj
the
figure
shook
its
long
hair
loose
which
provided
ross
with
the
necessary
clue
it
was
a
woman
not
a
very
woman
for
she
wore
no
makeup
but
by
the
hair
by
the
brows
and
by
the
smoothness
of
her
chin
a
woman
all
the
same
she
said
coldly
if
you
re
the
captain
who
s
that
helena
said
in
a
small
voice
i
m
helena
from
junior
unit
suddenly
the
woman
smiled
well
come
ashore
dear
she
said
you
must
be
tired
from
your
trip
both
of
you
come
ashore
she
added
graciously
she
led
the
way
out
of
the
clamshells
to
a
waiting
closed
car
azor
s
sun
had
an
unpleasant
bluish
cast
to
it
not
a
at
all
ross
thought
that
the
lighting
made
the
woman
look
uglier
than
she
really
had
to
be
even
helena
looked
pinched
and
bloodless
which
he
knew
well
was
not
the
case
at
all
all
around
them
was
activity
whatever
this
planet
s
faults
it
was
not
a
stagnant
home
for
graybeards
ross
craning
saw
nothing
that
was
shoddy
nothing
that
would
have
looked
out
of
place
in
the
port
of
halsey
s
planet
and
the
reception
lounge
or
whatever
it
was
that
the
woman
took
them
to
was
a
handsome
and
prettily
furnished
construction
some
lunch
the
woman
asked
directing
her
attention
to
helena
a
cup
of
tribrew
maybe
let
me
have
the
boy
bring
helena
looked
to
ross
for
signals
and
ross
gritting
his
teeth
nodded
to
her
to
agree
too
young
the
last
time
too
male
this
time
was
there
ever
going
to
be
a
planet
where
he
mattered
to
anyone
he
said
desperately
madam
forgive
my
interruption
but
this
lady
and
myself
need
urgently
to
get
in
touch
with
the
cavallo
company
is
this
novj
grad
the
woman
s
pale
brows
arched
she
said
with
an
effort
no
it
is
then
can
you
tell
us
where
novj
grad
is
ross
persisted
if
they
have
a
spaceport
we
can
hop
over
there
in
our
the
woman
gasped
something
that
sounded
like
well
she
stood
up
and
said
pointedly
to
helena
if
you
ll
excuse
me
i
have
something
to
attend
and
swept
out
helena
stared
at
ross
she
must
ve
been
a
real
senior
citizen
huh
not
exactly
said
ross
despairingly
look
helena
things
are
different
here
i
need
your
help
yes
help
he
bellowed
get
a
grip
on
yourself
girl
remember
what
i
told
you
about
the
planet
i
came
from
it
was
different
from
yours
remember
the
old
people
were
just
like
anybody
she
giggled
in
embarrassment
they
were
he
yelled
and
they
are
here
too
old
people
young
people
doesn
t
matter
on
my
planet
the
richest
people
never
mind
on
this
planet
women
are
the
bosses
get
it
women
are
like
elders
so
you
ll
have
to
take
over
she
was
looking
at
him
with
a
puzzled
frown
she
objected
but
if
women
they
are
never
mind
about
that
part
of
it
now
just
remember
that
for
the
purposes
of
getting
along
here
you
re
going
to
be
my
boss
you
tell
me
what
to
do
you
talk
to
everybody
and
what
you
have
to
say
to
them
is
this
you
must
get
to
novj
grad
immediately
and
talk
to
a
member
of
the
cavallo
company
clear
once
we
get
there
i
ll
take
over
everything
will
be
under
control
he
added
prayerfully
i
helena
blinked
at
him
i
m
going
to
be
your
boss
she
asked
that
s
like
an
elder
bosses
a
junior
and
it
s
legal
ross
started
to
repeat
that
s
right
impatiently
again
but
there
was
a
peculiar
look
in
helena
s
round
eyes
helena
he
said
warningly
she
was
all
concern
why
what
is
it
ross
she
asked
solicitously
you
look
upset
just
leave
everything
to
me
they
got
started
on
the
way
to
novj
in
their
ship
the
woman
had
said
there
was
no
spaceport
in
novj
grad
and
not
alone
so
that
ross
could
not
confirm
his
unhappy
opinion
of
helena
s
inner
thoughts
but
at
least
they
were
on
their
way
to
novj
grad
in
the
azorian
equivalent
of
a
chartered
aircraft
with
helena
chatting
happily
with
the
female
pilot
and
ross
sitting
uncomfortably
on
a
narrow
upholstered
strip
behind
everything
he
saw
in
azor
confirmed
his
first
impressions
the
planet
was
busy
and
prosperous
nobody
seemed
to
be
doing
anything
very
productive
he
thought
but
somehow
everything
seemed
to
get
done
automatic
machinery
he
guessed
if
women
were
to
have
any
chance
of
gaining
the
upper
hand
on
a
planet
most
of
the
hard
physical
work
would
have
to
be
fairly
well
mechanized
anyhow
and
particularly
on
this
planet
they
had
been
flying
for
six
hours
at
a
speed
he
guessed
to
be
not
much
below
that
of
sound
and
fully
half
of
the
territory
they
passed
over
was
bare
black
rock
the
ship
began
losing
altitude
and
the
pilot
who
had
been
curled
up
in
a
relaxed
position
totally
ignoring
the
aircraft
glanced
at
her
instrument
panel
coming
in
for
a
landing
she
warned
don
t
distract
me
right
now
dear
i
ve
got
a
thousand
things
to
she
didn
t
seem
to
be
doing
any
of
them
ross
thought
disapprovingly
all
she
did
was
watch
varicolored
lights
blink
on
and
off
but
no
doubt
the
ship
landing
too
was
as
automatic
as
the
piloting
helena
turned
and
leaned
back
to
ross
we
re
coming
in
for
a
landing
she
relayed
ross
said
sourly
i
helena
gave
him
a
look
of
reprimand
and
forgiveness
i
m
hungry
she
mused
the
pilot
turned
from
her
controls
you
can
get
something
at
the
airport
she
offered
eagerly
i
ll
show
helena
looked
at
ross
would
you
like
something
but
the
pilot
frowned
i
don
t
believe
there
s
any
place
for
men
she
said
disapprovingly
perhaps
we
can
get
something
sent
out
for
him
if
you
like
although
really
it
s
probably
against
the
rules
you
ross
started
to
say
with
great
dignity
thank
you
but
that
won
t
be
but
he
didn
t
quite
get
it
out
the
ship
came
in
for
its
landing
there
was
an
enormous
jolt
and
a
squawk
of
alarm
bells
and
flashing
lights
the
ship
careened
crazily
and
stopped
oh
darn
complained
the
pilot
mildly
it
s
always
doing
that
come
on
dear
let
s
get
something
to
eat
we
ll
come
back
for
and
ross
was
left
alone
to
stare
apprehensively
at
the
unceasingly
flashing
lights
and
to
listen
to
the
strident
alarms
for
of
an
hour
his
luck
was
in
though
the
ship
didn
t
explode
and
eventually
a
pallid
young
man
in
a
greasy
apron
appeared
with
a
tray
of
sandwiches
and
a
vacuum
jug
up
here
boy
ross
called
he
gaped
through
the
port
you
mean
come
in
sure
it
s
all
the
young
man
put
down
the
tray
something
in
the
way
he
looked
at
it
prompted
ross
to
invite
him
have
some
with
me
more
here
than
i
can
thanks
i
believe
i
will
i
uh
was
supposed
to
take
my
break
after
i
brought
you
this
he
poured
steaming
brew
into
the
cup
that
covered
the
jug
politely
pushed
it
to
ross
and
swigged
from
the
jug
himself
you
re
with
the
starship
he
asked
around
a
mouthful
of
sandwich
yes
captain
that
to
contact
an
outfit
called
cavallo
you
know
where
they
are
sure
biggest
firm
on
the
south
side
fifteen
street
you
can
t
miss
them
the
she
the
lady
who
was
with
pilot
breuer
the
youngster
s
eyes
widened
you
mean
you
were
in
a
lady
ross
nodded
and
chewed
and
she
didn
wasn
problem
no
said
ross
you
have
much
trouble
with
that
kind
of
thing
the
boy
winced
if
i
ve
asked
once
i
ve
asked
a
hundred
times
for
a
transfer
oh
those
jet
pilots
i
used
to
work
in
a
roadside
truck
stop
i
know
truckers
are
supposed
to
be
rough
and
tough
maybe
they
are
but
you
can
t
tell
me
that
deep
down
a
trucker
isn
t
a
lady
when
you
tell
them
no
that
s
that
but
a
just
eggs
them
on
azor
city
today
novj
grad
do
they
care
ross
was
fascinated
and
baffled
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
should
care
and
care
plenty
back
where
he
came
from
it
was
the
woman
who
paid
and
he
couldn
t
imagine
any
cultural
setup
which
could
alter
that
biological
fact
he
asked
cautiously
have
you
ever
trouble
the
boy
stiffened
and
looked
disapproving
then
he
said
with
a
sigh
i
might
as
well
tell
you
it
s
all
over
the
station
anyway
they
call
me
bernie
the
yes
twice
pilots
both
times
i
can
t
seem
to
say
he
took
another
long
pull
from
the
jug
and
a
savage
bite
from
a
second
sandwich
i
m
sure
ross
said
numbly
it
wasn
t
your
try
telling
that
to
the
judge
bernie
the
pullover
said
bitterly
the
pilot
speaks
her
piece
the
medic
puts
the
blood
group
tests
in
evidence
the
doctor
and
crèche
director
depose
that
the
child
was
born
and
is
still
living
then
the
judge
says
without
even
looking
up
paternity
judgment
to
the
plaintiff
defendant
ordered
to
pay
one
thousand
credits
annual
support
let
this
be
a
warning
to
you
young
man
next
i
shouldn
t
have
joined
you
and
eaten
your
sandwiches
but
the
fact
is
i
was
hungry
i
had
to
sell
my
meal
voucher
yesterday
to
meet
my
payment
miss
three
payments
he
jerked
his
thumb
heavenward
ross
thought
and
realized
that
the
thumb
must
indicate
the
orbiting
prison
hulk
it
the
man
who
paid
here
he
demanded
how
did
all
this
happen
bernie
having
admitted
his
hunger
had
stopped
stalling
and
seized
a
third
sandwich
all
what
he
asked
indistinctly
ross
thought
hard
and
long
he
realized
first
that
he
could
probably
never
explain
what
he
meant
to
bernie
and
second
that
if
he
did
they
d
probably
both
wind
up
aboard
minerva
for
conspiracy
to
advocate
equality
he
shifted
his
ground
of
course
everybody
agrees
on
the
natural
superiority
of
women
he
said
but
people
seem
to
differ
from
planet
to
planet
as
to
the
reasons
what
do
they
say
here
on
azor
special
or
fancy
just
the
logical
thing
they
re
smaller
for
one
thing
and
haven
t
got
the
muscles
of
men
so
they
re
natural
supervisors
they
accumulate
money
as
a
matter
of
course
because
men
die
younger
and
women
are
the
beneficiaries
then
women
have
a
natural
aptitude
for
all
the
interesting
jobs
i
saw
a
broadcast
about
that
just
the
other
night
the
biggest
specialist
on
the
planet
in
vocational
aptitude
i
forget
her
name
but
she
proved
it
he
looked
at
the
empty
platter
before
them
i
ve
got
to
go
now
thanks
for
the
pleasure
was
ross
watched
his
undernourished
figure
head
for
the
station
he
swore
a
little
and
then
buckled
down
to
some
hard
thinking
helena
was
his
key
to
this
world
he
d
have
to
have
a
long
or
two
with
her
he
couldn
t
be
constantly
prompting
her
or
there
would
be
serious
trouble
she
would
be
the
front
and
he
would
be
the
very
inconspicuous
brains
of
the
outfit
trailing
humbly
behind
but
was
she
capable
of
absorbing
a
rather
complicated
concept
she
seemed
to
be
he
told
himself
uncomfortably
in
love
with
him
that
would
help
considerably
helena
and
pilot
breuer
showed
up
walking
with
a
languor
that
suggested
a
large
and
pleasant
meal
disposed
of
helena
s
first
words
disposed
with
shocking
speed
of
ross
s
doubts
that
she
was
able
to
acquire
a
sociological
concept
they
were
ah
there
you
are
my
dear
did
the
boy
bring
you
something
or
other
to
eat
yes
thanks
very
thoughtful
of
you
he
said
pointedly
with
one
eye
on
breuer
s
reaction
there
was
none
he
seemed
to
have
struck
the
right
note
pilot
breuer
said
helena
blandly
thinks
i
d
enjoy
an
evening
doing
the
town
with
her
and
a
few
but
the
cavallo
ross
she
said
gently
don
t
he
shut
up
and
thought
wait
until
i
get
her
out
into
space
i
get
her
out
into
space
she
d
be
a
damned
fool
to
leave
this
culture
breuer
was
saying
with
an
altogether
air
i
d
better
get
you
two
settled
in
a
hotel
for
the
night
then
i
ll
pick
up
helena
and
a
few
friends
and
we
ll
show
her
what
old
novj
grad
has
to
offer
in
the
way
of
night
life
can
t
have
her
batting
around
the
universe
saying
azor
s
sidewalks
are
rolled
up
at
can
we
and
then
she
can
do
her
trading
or
whatever
it
is
with
cavallo
bright
and
early
tomorrow
eh
ross
realized
that
he
was
being
jollied
out
of
an
attack
of
the
sulks
he
didn
t
like
it
the
hotel
was
small
and
comfortable
with
a
bar
crowded
by
roistering
pilots
and
their
dates
the
glimpses
ross
got
of
social
life
on
azor
added
up
to
a
damnably
unfair
picture
it
was
the
man
who
paid
breuer
roguishly
tested
the
mattress
in
their
room
nudging
helena
and
then
announced
get
settled
kids
while
i
visit
the
when
the
door
rolled
shut
behind
her
ross
said
furiously
look
you
protective
mimicry
s
fine
up
to
a
point
but
let
s
not
forget
what
this
mission
is
all
about
we
seem
to
be
suckered
into
spending
the
night
but
by
hell
tomorrow
morning
bright
and
early
we
find
those
cavallo
there
helena
said
soothingly
don
t
be
angry
ross
i
promise
i
won
t
be
out
late
and
she
really
did
i
suppose
so
he
grumbled
just
remember
it
s
no
pleasure
not
for
you
perhaps
she
smiled
sweetly
he
let
it
drop
there
afraid
to
push
the
matter
breuer
returned
in
about
ten
minutes
with
a
slight
glow
on
it
s
all
fixed
she
told
helena
got
a
swell
crowd
lined
up
table
at
virgin
willie
she
glanced
at
ross
no
harm
in
it
of
course
she
said
anything
you
want
ross
just
dial
service
it
s
on
my
account
i
fixed
it
with
the
they
left
and
ross
went
grumpily
to
bed
a
secretive
rustle
in
the
room
awoke
him
helena
he
asked
drowsily
pilot
breuer
s
voice
giggled
drunkenly
nope
helena
s
passed
out
at
virgin
willie
s
kind
of
the
way
i
figured
she
would
be
on
triple
antigravs
had
my
eye
on
you
since
azor
city
baby
you
gon
na
be
nice
to
me
get
out
of
here
ross
hissed
furiously
out
of
here
or
i
ll
yell
like
so
yell
she
giggled
i
got
the
house
dick
fixed
they
know
me
here
he
fumbled
for
the
bedside
light
and
snapped
it
on
i
ll
pitch
you
right
through
the
door
he
announced
and
if
you
give
me
any
more
lip
i
won
t
bother
to
open
it
before
i
she
hiccupped
and
said
a
spirited
lad
that
s
the
way
i
like
with
one
hand
she
drew
a
little
pistol
with
the
other
she
pulled
a
long
zipper
and
stepped
out
of
her
pilot
s
coveralls
ross
gulped
there
were
three
ways
to
play
this
the
smart
way
the
stupid
way
and
the
way
that
all
of
a
sudden
began
to
look
attractive
he
tried
the
stupid
way
he
got
the
pistol
barrel
alongside
his
ear
for
his
pains
don
t
jump
me
pilot
breuer
giggled
the
boys
that
ve
tried
to
take
this
gun
away
from
me
are
stretched
end
to
end
from
here
to
azor
city
by
me
ross
blinked
through
a
haze
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
got
smart
you
re
pretty
tough
he
said
admiringly
oh
she
kicked
the
coveralls
across
the
room
and
moved
in
on
him
baby
she
said
caressingly
if
i
seem
to
sort
of
forget
myself
in
the
next
couple
of
minutes
don
t
get
any
ideas
i
let
go
of
my
gun
move
sure
ross
said
hollowly
this
he
told
himself
disgustedly
was
the
damnedest
silliest
ridiculousest
there
was
a
furious
hiccup
from
the
door
so
helena
said
venomously
pushing
the
door
wide
and
almost
falling
to
the
floor
so
ross
flailed
out
of
the
bed
kicking
the
pistol
out
of
pilot
breuer
s
hand
in
the
process
he
cried
enthusiastically
helena
dear
don
t
you
me
she
said
moving
in
and
kicking
the
door
shut
behind
her
i
leave
you
alone
for
one
little
minute
and
what
happens
and
sorry
pilot
breuer
muttered
climbing
into
her
coveralls
wrong
room
must
ve
had
one
too
she
licked
her
lips
apprehensively
zipping
her
coveralls
and
sidling
toward
the
door
with
one
hand
on
the
knob
she
said
diffidently
if
i
could
have
my
gun
no
you
re
right
i
ll
get
it
she
got
through
the
door
just
ahead
of
a
lamp
hussy
spat
helena
and
you
it
was
the
last
straw
as
ross
lurched
toward
her
he
regretted
only
one
thing
that
he
didn
t
have
a
hairbrush
pilot
breuer
had
been
right
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
the
noise
yes
helena
had
hardly
touched
her
breakfast
she
sat
with
her
eyes
downcast
yes
ross
he
mimicked
bitterly
it
better
be
yes
this
place
may
look
all
right
to
you
but
it
s
trouble
you
don
t
want
to
find
yourself
stuck
here
all
your
life
do
you
then
do
what
i
tell
yes
he
pushed
the
remains
of
his
food
away
oh
the
hell
with
it
he
said
dispiritedly
i
wish
i
d
never
started
out
on
this
fool
s
errand
and
i
double
damn
well
wish
i
d
left
you
in
the
dye
yes
mean
i
m
glad
you
didn
t
ross
she
said
in
a
small
voice
he
stood
up
and
patted
her
shoulder
absently
come
on
he
said
we
ve
got
to
get
over
to
the
cavallo
place
i
wish
you
had
let
me
talk
to
them
on
the
she
said
reasonably
but
you
i
know
what
i
said
when
we
get
there
remember
that
i
do
the
they
walked
through
streets
filled
with
women
and
men
the
cavallo
corporation
was
only
a
few
intersections
away
by
the
map
the
desk
clerk
had
drawn
for
helena
they
found
it
without
trouble
it
was
a
smallish
sort
of
building
for
a
factory
ross
thought
but
perhaps
that
was
how
factories
went
on
azor
besides
it
was
well
constructed
and
beautifully
landscaped
with
the
purplish
lawns
these
people
seemed
to
prefer
helena
led
him
through
the
door
as
was
right
and
proper
she
said
to
the
busy
little
man
who
seemed
to
be
the
receptionist
we
re
expected
miss
cavallo
certainly
ma
am
he
said
with
a
smile
and
worked
a
combination
of
rods
and
buttons
on
the
desk
beside
him
in
a
moment
he
said
go
right
in
three
up
and
four
over
can
t
miss
they
passed
through
a
noisy
territory
of
machines
where
metal
was
sliced
spun
hacked
and
planed
no
one
seemed
to
be
paying
any
attention
to
them
ross
wondered
who
had
built
the
machines
and
had
a
sudden
flash
of
realization
as
to
where
those
builders
were
now
on
minerva
staring
at
the
unattainable
free
sky
miss
cavallo
was
a
motherly
type
with
a
large
black
cigar
sit
right
down
she
said
heartily
you
too
young
man
tell
me
what
we
in
cavallo
company
can
do
for
helena
opened
her
mouth
but
ross
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
that
s
enough
he
said
quietly
i
ll
take
over
miss
cavallo
he
declaimed
from
memory
what
follows
is
under
the
is
it
indeed
what
do
you
know
she
said
ross
said
miss
cavallo
slapped
her
thigh
admiringly
son
of
a
gun
she
said
admiringly
how
this
takes
me
childhood
days
learning
these
things
at
my
mother
s
knee
let
s
see
limiting
velocity
is
but
is
not
a
velocity
ross
finished
triumphantly
and
from
the
heart
miss
cavallo
you
don
t
begin
to
know
how
happy
this
makes
miss
cavallo
reached
over
and
pumped
his
hand
then
helena
s
to
the
girl
she
said
you
ve
got
a
right
to
be
a
proud
woman
believe
me
the
way
he
got
through
it
without
a
single
stumble
never
saw
anything
like
it
in
my
life
well
just
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
now
that
that
s
ross
took
a
deep
deep
breath
he
said
earnestly
a
great
deal
i
don
t
know
where
to
begin
you
see
it
all
goes
back
to
halsey
s
planet
where
i
come
from
this
uh
this
ship
came
in
a
longliner
and
it
got
some
of
us
a
little
worried
because
well
it
seemed
that
some
of
the
planets
were
no
longer
in
communication
miss
cavallo
she
was
smiling
pleasantly
enough
but
ross
had
the
crazy
feeling
that
he
just
wasn
t
getting
through
to
her
go
right
ahead
she
boomed
god
knows
i
ve
got
nothing
against
men
in
business
that
s
prejudice
take
your
time
i
won
t
bite
you
get
on
with
your
proposition
young
it
isn
t
exactly
a
proposition
ross
said
weakly
all
of
a
sudden
the
words
seemed
hard
to
find
what
did
you
say
to
a
potential
partner
in
the
salvation
of
the
human
race
when
she
just
nodded
and
blew
cigar
smoke
at
you
he
made
an
effort
halsey
s
planet
was
the
seventh
alternate
destination
for
this
ship
and
so
we
is
miss
cavallo
it
kind
of
looked
like
there
was
some
sort
of
trouble
so
s
the
one
who
has
the
secret
on
halsey
like
you
do
here
on
passed
it
on
to
me
of
he
asked
me
to
well
sort
of
take
a
look
he
stopped
the
words
by
then
were
just
barely
audible
anyhow
and
miss
cavallo
had
been
looking
furtively
at
her
watch
miss
cavallo
shrugged
sympathetically
to
helena
they
re
all
like
that
under
the
skin
aren
t
they
she
observed
ambiguously
well
if
men
could
take
our
jobs
away
from
us
what
would
we
do
stay
home
and
mind
the
kids
she
roared
and
poked
a
box
of
cigars
at
helena
now
she
said
briskly
let
s
get
down
to
cases
i
really
enjoyed
hearing
those
lines
from
you
young
man
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
m
prepared
to
help
you
in
any
possible
way
because
of
them
open
a
line
of
credit
speed
up
deliveries
send
along
some
of
our
technical
people
to
help
you
get
set
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
turret
lathes
grinders
screw
machines
miss
cavallo
ross
said
desperately
don
t
you
know
anything
about
the
secret
she
said
impatiently
of
course
i
do
young
man
said
the
responses
didn
t
i
there
s
no
call
for
that
item
i
don
t
want
to
one
ross
cried
i
have
one
don
t
you
realize
that
the
human
race
is
in
danger
populations
are
dying
out
or
going
out
of
communication
all
over
the
galaxy
don
t
you
want
to
do
something
about
it
before
we
all
go
under
miss
cavallo
dropped
all
traces
of
a
smile
her
face
was
like
flint
as
she
stood
up
and
pointed
to
the
window
young
man
she
said
icily
take
a
look
out
there
that
s
the
cavallo
company
does
that
look
as
if
we
re
going
under
i
know
but
clyde
cyrnus
one
least
a
dozen
planets
i
can
didn
t
you
ever
think
that
you
might
be
next
miss
cavallo
kept
her
voice
level
but
only
with
a
visible
effort
she
said
flatly
no
never
young
man
i
have
plenty
to
do
right
here
on
azor
without
bothering
my
head
about
those
places
you
re
talking
about
years
ago
there
was
another
fellow
just
like
you
flarney
some
name
like
that
my
grandmother
told
me
about
him
he
came
bustling
in
here
causing
trouble
with
that
old
silly
jingle
about
wesley
and
and
so
on
with
some
story
about
a
planet
that
was
starving
to
death
stirring
up
a
lot
of
commotion
well
he
wound
up
on
minerva
because
he
wouldn
t
take
no
for
an
answer
watch
out
that
you
don
t
do
the
she
marched
majestically
to
the
door
and
now
she
said
if
you
ve
wasted
quite
enough
of
my
time
kindly
stupid
old
bat
ross
muttered
they
were
walking
aimlessly
down
fifteen
street
the
machine
tool
works
behind
them
helena
said
timidly
you
really
shouldn
t
talk
that
way
ross
she
older
than
you
after
all
old
heads
he
wearily
agreed
also
the
most
conservative
also
the
most
rigidly
inflexible
also
the
most
firmly
closed
to
the
reception
of
new
ideas
with
one
she
reeled
under
the
triple
blasphemy
and
then
faintly
asked
what
s
the
exception
ross
became
aware
that
they
were
not
alone
their
very
manner
of
walking
he
a
little
ahead
obviously
leading
the
way
was
drawing
unfavorable
attention
from
nothing
organized
or
even
looks
ranging
from
puzzled
distaste
to
anger
he
said
somebody
named
haarland
never
mind
and
in
a
lower
voice
straighten
up
step
out
a
little
ahead
of
me
she
managed
it
all
except
the
scowl
the
expression
on
her
face
got
some
stupefied
looks
from
other
pedestrians
but
nothing
worse
helena
said
loudly
and
plaintively
i
don
t
like
it
here
after
all
ross
can
t
we
get
away
from
all
these
women
should
the
impulse
seize
you
placard
ancient
brooklyn
with
sheets
proclaiming
the
dodgers
to
be
bums
mount
a
detergent
box
and
inform
a
crowd
of
altairians
that
they
are
degenerate
if
you
must
announce
in
a
crowded
cephean
bar
room
that
sadkia
revall
is
no
better
than
she
should
be
from
these
situations
you
have
some
chance
of
emerging
intact
but
never
never
pronounce
the
word
women
as
helena
pronounced
it
on
fifteen
street
novj
grad
azor
the
mob
took
only
seconds
to
form
ross
and
helena
found
themselves
with
their
backs
to
the
glass
doors
of
a
food
store
the
handful
of
women
who
had
actually
heard
the
remark
were
all
talking
to
them
simultaneously
with
behind
them
stood
as
many
as
a
dozen
women
who
knew
only
that
something
had
happened
and
that
there
were
comfortably
outnumbered
victims
available
the
noise
was
deafening
and
helena
began
to
cry
ross
first
wondered
if
he
could
bring
himself
to
knock
down
a
woman
then
realized
after
studying
the
hulking
virago
in
their
foreground
that
he
might
bring
himself
to
try
but
probably
would
not
succeed
she
seemed
to
be
accusing
helena
of
masquerading
of
advocating
equality
of
uttering
obscenely
antisocial
statements
in
the
public
road
to
the
affront
of
all
girls
there
was
violence
in
the
air
ross
was
on
the
point
of
blocking
a
roundhouse
right
when
the
glass
doors
opened
behind
them
the
small
diversion
distracted
the
imbecile
collective
brain
of
the
mob
what
s
going
on
here
a
suety
voice
demanded
ladies
may
i
please
get
through
it
was
a
man
trying
to
emerge
from
the
food
shop
with
a
double
armful
of
cartons
he
was
a
great
fat
slob
quite
hairless
and
smelling
powerfully
of
kitchen
he
wore
the
whites
of
any
cook
anywhere
the
virago
said
to
him
keep
out
of
this
willie
this
fellow
here
s
a
masquerader
the
thing
i
heard
him
i
m
not
helena
wept
i
m
not
the
cook
stooped
to
look
into
her
face
and
turned
on
the
mob
she
isn
t
he
said
definitely
she
s
a
lady
from
another
system
she
was
slopping
up
triple
antigravs
at
my
place
last
night
with
a
gang
of
jet
that
doesn
t
prove
a
thing
the
virago
yelled
madam
the
cook
said
wearily
after
her
third
antigrav
i
had
to
trip
her
up
and
crown
her
she
was
about
to
climb
the
bar
and
corner
my
ross
looked
at
her
fixedly
she
stopped
crying
and
nervously
cleared
her
throat
so
if
you
ll
just
let
us
through
the
cook
bustled
seizing
the
psychological
moment
of
doubt
his
enormous
belly
bulldozed
a
lane
for
them
beg
pardon
excuse
us
madam
will
you
beg
the
lynchers
were
beginning
to
drift
away
embarrassed
the
party
had
collapsed
faster
the
cook
hissed
at
them
beg
and
they
were
in
the
clear
and
well
down
the
street
thank
you
sir
helena
said
humbly
just
willie
you
please
the
fat
man
said
one
hand
descended
on
ross
s
shoulder
and
another
on
helena
s
they
both
belonged
to
the
virago
she
spun
them
around
glaring
not
satisfied
with
the
she
snapped
exactly
what
did
you
mean
by
that
remark
you
made
helena
wailed
it
s
just
that
you
and
all
these
other
women
here
seem
so
the
virago
s
granite
face
softened
she
let
go
and
tucked
in
a
strand
of
hair
did
you
really
think
so
dear
she
asked
beaming
there
i
m
sorry
i
got
excited
a
wee
bit
jealous
were
you
well
we
re
here
in
novj
she
patted
helena
s
arm
and
walked
off
smiling
and
jaunty
virgin
willie
led
off
and
they
followed
him
ross
s
knees
were
shaky
the
virago
had
not
known
that
to
helena
young
meant
the
cook
absently
acknowledged
smiles
and
nods
as
they
walked
he
was
obviously
a
character
between
salutes
he
delivered
a
reaming
to
ross
and
helena
silly
stunt
didn
t
you
hear
about
the
riots
supposed
to
be
arms
caches
somewhere
here
on
the
south
side
everybody
s
nerves
absolutely
ragged
somebody
gets
smashed
up
in
traffic
they
blame
it
on
us
don
t
care
you
re
from
watch
it
next
we
will
willie
helena
said
contritely
and
i
think
you
run
an
awfully
nice
yeah
said
ross
looking
at
her
willie
muttered
i
guess
you
re
clear
you
still
staying
at
that
hot
pilot
s
hangout
this
is
where
we
say
then
you
turn
he
waddled
on
down
the
street
helena
said
instantly
i
don
t
remember
a
thing
okay
he
said
you
don
t
remember
a
she
looked
relieved
and
said
brightly
so
let
s
get
back
to
the
okay
he
said
climbed
the
bar
and
tried
to
corner
the
halfway
to
the
hotel
he
slowed
then
stopped
and
said
i
just
thought
of
something
maybe
we
re
not
staying
there
any
more
after
last
night
why
should
breuer
carry
us
on
her
tab
i
thought
we
d
have
some
money
to
carry
us
from
the
cavallos
by
the
ship
she
asked
in
a
small
voice
across
the
continent
hell
maybe
breuer
forgave
and
forgot
let
s
try
they
never
got
as
far
as
the
hotel
when
they
reached
the
square
it
stood
on
there
was
a
breathless
rush
and
bernie
stood
before
them
panting
and
holding
a
hand
over
his
chest
in
here
he
gasped
and
nodded
at
a
shopfront
that
announced
hot
brew
ross
thoughtlessly
started
first
through
the
door
and
caught
bernie
s
look
of
alarm
he
opened
the
door
for
helena
who
went
through
smiling
nervously
they
settled
at
a
small
table
in
an
empty
corner
in
stiff
silence
i
ve
been
walking
around
that
square
all
morning
bernie
said
with
a
cowed
look
at
helena
ross
told
her
this
young
man
and
i
had
a
talk
yesterday
at
the
plane
while
you
were
eating
what
is
it
bernie
he
still
couldn
t
believe
that
he
was
doing
it
but
bernie
said
in
a
scared
whisper
wanted
to
head
you
off
and
warn
you
breuer
was
down
at
the
field
cafe
this
morning
talking
loud
to
the
other
she
said
of
equality
said
she
got
up
with
a
hangover
and
you
were
gone
but
she
said
there
d
be
six
policewomen
waiting
in
your
room
when
you
got
he
leaned
forward
on
the
table
ross
remembered
that
he
had
been
forced
to
sell
his
ration
card
here
comes
the
waiter
he
said
softly
order
something
for
all
of
us
we
have
a
little
money
and
thanks
helena
asked
what
do
we
we
eat
ross
said
practically
then
we
think
shut
up
let
bernie
they
ate
and
then
they
thought
nothing
much
seemed
to
come
from
all
the
thinking
though
they
were
a
long
long
way
from
the
spaceship
ross
commandeered
all
of
helena
s
leftover
cash
it
was
almost
not
quite
enough
for
one
person
to
get
halfway
back
to
azor
city
he
and
bernie
turned
out
their
pockets
and
added
everything
they
had
including
pawnable
valuables
that
helped
it
made
the
total
almost
enough
for
one
person
to
get
of
the
way
back
it
didn
t
help
enough
ross
said
bernie
what
would
happen
if
we
well
stole
something
bernie
shrugged
it
s
against
the
law
of
course
they
probably
wouldn
t
prosecute
they
wouldn
t
not
if
they
can
prove
egalitarianism
on
you
stealing
s
against
the
law
preaching
equality
is
against
the
you
get
the
maximum
penalty
for
helena
choked
on
her
drink
but
ross
merely
nodded
so
we
might
as
well
take
a
chance
he
said
thanks
bernie
we
won
t
bother
you
any
more
you
ll
forget
you
heard
this
won
t
you
the
hell
i
will
bernie
squawked
if
you
re
getting
out
of
here
i
want
to
go
with
you
you
aren
t
leaving
behind
but
ross
started
he
was
interrupted
by
the
manager
a
female
with
a
mighty
prow
who
came
scowling
toward
them
pipe
down
she
ordered
coarsely
this
place
is
for
decent
people
we
don
t
want
no
disturbances
here
if
you
can
t
act
decent
get
awk
said
helena
as
ross
kicked
her
under
the
table
i
mean
yes
ma
am
sorry
if
we
were
talking
too
they
watched
the
manager
walk
away
in
silence
as
soon
as
she
was
fairly
away
ross
hissed
it
s
out
of
the
question
bernie
you
might
be
jumping
from
the
into
the
bernie
asked
startled
the
what
mind
it
s
just
an
expression
where
i
come
from
it
means
you
might
get
out
of
this
place
and
find
yourself
somewhere
worse
we
don
t
know
where
we
re
going
next
you
might
wish
to
god
you
were
back
here
within
the
next
three
i
ll
take
that
chance
bernie
said
earnestly
look
ross
i
played
square
with
you
i
didn
t
have
to
stick
my
neck
out
and
warn
you
how
about
giving
me
a
break
too
helena
interrupted
he
s
right
ross
after
all
we
owe
him
that
much
don
t
we
i
mean
if
a
person
does
that
much
for
a
person
a
person
ought
oh
shut
ross
glared
at
both
of
them
you
two
seem
to
think
this
is
a
game
he
said
bitterly
let
me
set
you
straight
both
of
you
it
isn
t
more
hangs
on
what
happens
to
me
than
either
of
you
realize
the
fate
of
the
human
race
for
helena
flashed
a
look
at
bernie
of
ross
she
said
soothingly
both
of
us
know
that
don
t
we
bernie
bernie
stammered
we
do
he
rubbed
his
ankle
he
went
on
honest
ross
i
want
to
get
the
hell
away
from
azor
once
and
for
all
i
don
t
care
you
re
going
anything
would
be
better
than
this
place
and
the
damned
female
bloodsuckers
he
stopped
petrified
his
eyes
looking
over
ross
s
shoulder
were
enormous
go
on
sonny
said
a
rich
female
voice
from
behind
ross
don
t
let
me
and
the
lieutenant
stop
you
just
when
you
re
going
it
must
have
been
that
damn
manager
bernie
said
for
the
fifteenth
time
ross
uncrossed
his
legs
painfully
and
tried
lying
on
the
floor
on
his
side
what
s
the
difference
he
asked
they
got
us
we
re
in
the
jug
and
face
it
somebody
would
have
caught
us
sooner
or
later
and
we
might
have
wound
up
in
a
worse
jail
than
this
he
shifted
uncomfortably
if
that
s
possible
i
mean
why
don
t
they
at
least
have
beds
in
these
places
oh
said
bernie
immediately
some
do
the
jails
in
azor
city
and
nuevo
reykjavik
have
beds
novj
grad
eleanor
and
milo
don
t
i
mean
that
s
what
they
tell
me
he
added
virtuously
sure
ross
growled
well
what
do
they
tell
you
usually
happens
next
bernie
spread
his
hands
different
things
first
there
s
a
hearing
that
s
all
over
by
now
then
an
indictment
and
trial
maybe
that
s
started
already
sometimes
they
get
it
in
on
the
same
day
as
the
hearing
sometimes
not
sometime
most
the
sentencing
we
ll
know
about
that
though
because
we
ll
be
there
the
law
s
very
strict
on
always
have
you
in
the
court
for
ross
cried
you
mean
the
trial
might
be
going
on
right
now
without
us
of
course
what
else
think
they
d
take
a
chance
on
having
the
prisoners
creating
a
disturbance
during
the
trial
ross
groaned
and
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
for
this
he
thought
he
had
come
the
better
part
of
a
hundred
light
years
for
this
he
had
left
a
comfortable
job
with
a
brilliant
future
he
spent
a
measurable
period
of
time
cursing
the
memory
of
old
haarland
and
his
persuasive
tongue
back
in
the
days
of
ross
s
early
teens
he
had
seen
a
good
many
situations
like
this
in
the
and
the
hero
had
never
failed
to
extricate
himself
by
a
simple
exercise
of
superhuman
strength
intellect
and
ingenuity
that
ross
told
himself
was
just
what
he
needed
now
the
trouble
was
he
didn
t
have
them
all
he
had
was
the
secret
of
travel
and
here
on
azor
as
on
the
planet
of
the
graybeards
it
had
laid
a
egg
women
ross
thought
bitterly
women
were
basically
and
trust
them
with
the
secret
of
make
them
like
the
cavallos
custodians
of
a
truth
and
see
the
secret
lost
or
embalmed
in
sterile
custom
what
he
silently
demanded
of
himself
did
the
greatest
of
scientific
discoveries
mean
to
a
biological
how
could
any
single
member
of
which
class
had
ever
painted
a
great
picture
written
a
great
book
composed
a
great
sonata
or
discovered
a
great
scientific
the
ultimate
importance
of
the
drive
it
was
like
entrusting
a
shakespeare
to
a
broody
hen
the
shredded
scraps
would
be
made
into
a
nest
for
the
egg
came
first
motherhood
was
all
that
explained
it
of
course
that
ross
told
himself
moodily
explained
everything
except
why
the
secret
had
fallen
into
apparently
equal
or
worse
desuetude
on
such
planets
as
gemsel
clyde
cyrnus
one
ragansworld
tau
ceti
ii
capella
s
family
of
eight
and
perhaps
a
hundred
others
ragansworld
was
gone
entirely
drowned
in
a
planetary
nebula
the
planet
of
the
graybeard
had
gone
to
seed
nothing
new
nothing
not
hallowed
by
tradition
had
a
chance
in
its
decrepit
social
order
his
home
halsey
s
planet
was
rapidly
calmly
inevitably
depopulating
itself
and
azor
had
fallen
into
a
rigid
matriarchal
order
that
only
an
act
of
god
could
break
was
there
a
pattern
were
there
any
similarities
ross
searched
desperately
in
his
mind
but
without
result
the
image
of
helena
kept
intruding
itself
between
him
and
his
thoughts
was
he
getting
sentimental
about
that
sweet
little
chucklehead
who
he
hastily
added
had
come
near
to
criminally
assaulting
him
who
had
climbed
the
he
turned
to
the
little
waiter
and
demanded
will
on
the
orbital
station
with
us
if
we
re
all
convicted
i
should
think
not
as
a
responsible
person
she
gets
the
supreme
ross
numbly
asked
after
a
long
pause
how
it
was
hard
to
think
of
helena
dangling
grotesquely
at
a
rope
s
end
or
jolting
as
she
sat
strapped
in
a
large
ugly
chair
but
there
were
things
he
had
heard
of
which
were
horribly
worse
bernie
had
been
watching
him
i
m
sorry
the
little
man
said
soberly
it
s
up
to
the
judge
she
s
a
foreigner
so
they
may
consider
that
an
extenuating
circumstance
and
place
some
poison
aboard
for
her
to
take
otherwise
it
s
slow
a
faint
irrational
hope
had
begun
to
dawn
in
ross
s
mind
aboard
what
exactly
how
does
it
work
they
ll
put
her
aboard
some
hulk
with
the
rockets
disabled
fire
it
off
into
that
s
that
i
suppose
they
ll
use
the
ship
she
came
ross
was
frantically
searching
his
pockets
he
had
a
stylus
got
any
paper
he
briskly
demanded
of
bernie
yes
the
waiter
blankly
passed
over
an
order
book
ross
sprawled
on
the
floor
and
began
to
scribble
never
mind
how
or
why
this
works
do
it
you
saw
me
work
the
big
computer
in
the
center
room
and
you
can
do
it
too
find
the
master
star
maps
in
the
chart
room
look
up
the
of
halsey
s
system
set
these
on
the
dials
marked
proximate
mass
take
the
readings
on
the
windows
above
the
dials
and
set
them
on
the
cursors
of
the
he
scribbled
furiously
from
time
to
time
forcing
himself
deliberately
to
slow
down
as
the
writing
became
an
unreadable
scrawl
he
filled
the
ruled
fronts
of
the
order
pages
and
then
the
ten
thousand
words
and
not
one
of
them
wasted
haarland
s
precise
instructions
mercilessly
drilled
into
him
flowed
out
again
he
flung
the
stylus
down
at
last
and
read
through
the
book
again
ignoring
the
gaping
bernie
it
was
all
there
as
far
as
he
could
tell
grant
her
a
lot
of
luck
and
more
brains
than
he
privately
credited
her
with
and
she
had
a
fighting
chance
of
winding
up
within
radar
range
of
halsey
s
planet
gca
could
take
her
down
from
there
an
annoying
object
hanging
on
the
radarscopes
would
provoke
a
reconnaissance
she
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
or
the
wesley
drive
but
did
he
that
fact
itself
was
no
handicap
he
might
rot
on
minerva
but
some
word
might
get
back
to
haarland
and
so
would
the
ship
and
helena
would
not
perish
miserably
in
a
drifting
hulk
bernie
saw
the
mysterious
job
was
ended
and
dared
to
ask
a
letter
no
ross
said
jubilantly
by
god
if
things
break
right
they
won
t
get
her
it
s
like
he
happily
began
to
explain
that
his
ship
s
rockets
were
only
auxiliaries
for
fine
maneuvering
but
he
counted
on
the
court
not
knowing
that
if
he
and
helena
could
persuade
as
he
went
on
the
look
on
bernie
s
face
changed
very
slowly
from
hope
to
pity
to
interest
correspondingly
ross
s
accounting
became
labored
and
faulty
the
pauses
became
longer
and
at
last
he
broke
off
filled
with
at
his
folly
he
said
bitterly
you
don
t
think
it
ll
oh
no
bernie
protested
with
too
much
heartiness
i
could
see
she
s
awfully
for
a
woman
even
if
it
wouldn
t
be
polite
to
say
so
sure
it
ll
work
ross
sure
the
hell
it
would
at
least
he
had
disposed
of
a
few
hours
some
bungling
setting
would
explode
the
ship
or
end
a
wesley
jump
in
the
heart
of
a
white
dwarf
annihilation
whiffing
helena
out
of
existence
before
her
body
could
realize
that
it
had
died
before
the
beginning
of
apprehension
could
darken
happy
absorption
with
a
task
she
thought
would
bring
her
to
safety
for
that
reason
alone
he
had
to
carry
the
scheme
through
the
courtroom
was
a
chintzy
place
bright
with
spring
flowers
ross
and
helena
looked
numbly
at
one
another
from
opposite
corners
while
the
previous
order
of
business
was
cleared
from
the
docket
a
wedding
the
judge
unexpectedly
and
slender
though
gray
obviously
took
such
parts
of
her
work
seriously
marylyn
and
kent
she
was
saying
earnestly
to
the
happy
couple
i
suppose
you
know
my
reputation
i
lecture
people
a
bit
before
i
tie
the
knot
evidently
it
s
not
such
a
bad
idea
because
my
marriages
turn
out
well
last
week
in
eleanor
one
of
my
girls
was
arrested
and
reprimanded
for
gross
infidelity
and
a
couple
of
years
ago
right
here
in
novj
grad
one
of
my
boys
got
five
hundred
lashes
for
nonsupport
let
s
hope
it
did
them
some
good
but
the
cases
were
unusual
my
people
i
like
to
think
know
their
rights
and
responsibilities
when
they
walk
out
of
my
court
and
i
think
the
record
bears
me
out
marylyn
you
have
chosen
to
share
part
of
your
life
with
this
man
you
intend
to
bear
his
children
this
should
not
be
because
your
animal
appetites
have
overcome
you
and
you
can
t
win
his
consent
in
any
other
way
but
because
you
know
down
deep
in
your
womanly
heart
that
you
can
make
him
happy
never
forget
this
if
you
should
thoughtlessly
conceive
by
some
other
man
don
t
tell
him
he
would
only
brood
be
thrifty
marylyn
i
have
seen
more
marriages
broken
up
by
finances
than
any
other
reason
if
your
husband
earns
a
hundred
eleanors
a
week
spend
only
that
and
no
more
if
he
makes
eleanors
a
week
spend
only
that
and
no
more
honorable
poverty
is
preferable
to
debt
and
from
a
practical
standpoint
if
you
spend
more
than
your
husband
earns
he
will
be
jailed
for
debt
sooner
or
later
with
resulting
loss
to
your
own
pocket
kent
you
have
accepted
the
proposal
of
this
woman
i
see
by
your
dossier
that
you
got
in
just
under
the
wire
in
your
income
group
the
antibachelor
laws
would
have
caught
up
with
you
in
one
more
week
i
must
say
i
don
t
like
the
look
of
it
but
i
ll
give
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
meaning
of
marriage
not
just
the
wage
assignment
not
just
the
insurance
policy
not
just
the
waiver
of
paternity
and
copulation
rights
those
as
a
good
citizen
you
will
abide
by
help
you
if
you
don
t
but
there
is
more
to
marriage
than
that
the
honor
you
have
been
done
by
this
woman
who
sees
you
as
desirable
and
who
wishes
to
make
you
happy
over
the
years
is
not
a
sterile
legalism
marriage
is
like
a
rocket
i
sometimes
think
the
brute
unreasoning
strength
of
the
main
jets
representing
the
husband
s
share
and
the
delicate
precise
steering
and
stabilizing
jets
the
wife
s
we
have
all
of
us
seen
too
many
marriages
crash
to
the
ground
like
a
rocket
when
these
roles
were
reversed
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
the
wife
to
provide
the
is
the
income
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
the
husband
to
provide
the
is
the
direction
of
the
personal
and
household
expenditures
so
much
for
the
material
side
of
things
on
the
spiritual
side
i
have
little
to
say
the
laws
are
most
explicit
see
that
you
obey
if
you
don
t
you
had
better
pray
that
you
wind
up
in
some
court
other
than
mine
i
have
no
patience
with
the
obsolete
doctrine
that
there
is
such
a
legal
entity
as
seduction
by
female
despite
the
mouthings
of
certain
jurists
who
disgrace
the
bench
of
a
certain
nearby
city
having
heard
these
things
marylyn
and
kent
step
forward
and
join
they
did
the
ceremony
was
short
and
simple
the
couple
then
walked
from
the
courtroom
under
the
beaming
smile
of
the
judge
a
burly
guard
next
to
ross
pointed
at
the
groom
look
she
said
sentimentally
he
s
crying
cute
i
don
t
blame
the
poor
sucker
ross
flared
and
then
being
a
man
of
conscience
wondered
suddenly
if
that
was
why
on
halsey
s
planet
women
cried
at
weddings
a
clerk
called
dear
let
s
have
those
egalitarians
front
and
center
please
her
honor
s
terribly
helena
was
escorted
forward
from
one
side
while
ross
and
bernie
were
jostled
to
the
fore
from
the
other
the
judge
turned
from
the
happy
couple
as
she
looked
down
at
the
three
of
them
the
smile
that
curved
her
lips
turned
into
something
quite
different
ross
quailing
suddenly
realized
that
he
had
seen
just
that
expression
once
before
it
was
when
he
was
very
very
young
when
a
friend
of
his
mother
s
had
come
bustling
into
the
kitchen
where
he
was
playing
just
after
she
had
smelled
and
just
before
she
had
seen
the
rat
he
had
fetched
up
from
the
abandoned
cellar
across
the
street
while
the
clerk
was
reading
the
orders
and
indictment
the
judge
s
stare
never
wavered
and
when
the
clerk
had
finished
the
judge
s
silent
stare
remained
for
a
long
terrible
time
in
the
quietest
of
voices
the
judge
said
ross
caught
a
flicker
of
motion
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
turned
just
in
time
to
see
bernie
knees
buckling
slip
and
unconscious
to
the
floor
the
guards
rushed
forward
but
the
judge
raised
a
peremptory
hand
leave
him
alone
she
ordered
soberly
it
is
kinder
defendants
you
are
charged
with
the
gravest
of
crimes
have
you
anything
to
say
before
sentence
is
passed
on
you
ross
tried
to
force
words
to
protest
to
plead
to
his
clogged
throat
all
he
managed
was
a
croaking
sound
and
helena
by
his
side
nudged
him
sharply
to
silence
he
turned
to
her
sharply
and
realized
that
this
was
the
best
chance
he
d
be
likely
to
get
he
clutched
at
her
rolled
up
his
eyes
slumped
to
the
floor
in
as
close
an
imitation
of
bernie
s
swoon
as
he
could
manage
the
judge
was
visibly
annoyed
and
this
time
she
didn
t
stop
the
attendants
when
they
rushed
in
to
kick
him
erect
but
he
had
the
consolation
of
seeing
a
flash
of
understanding
cross
helena
s
face
and
her
hand
dart
to
a
pocket
with
the
paper
he
had
handed
her
in
the
confusion
no
one
saw
the
rest
of
the
courtroom
scene
was
kaleidoscopic
in
ross
s
recollection
the
only
part
he
remembered
clearly
was
the
judge
s
voice
as
she
said
to
him
and
bernie
the
rest
of
your
lives
as
long
as
almighty
god
shall
in
her
infinite
wisdom
permit
you
the
breath
of
life
be
banished
from
azor
and
all
of
its
allied
worlds
to
the
prison
hulk
in
orbit
and
they
were
hustled
out
as
the
judge
even
more
wrathful
than
before
turned
to
pronounce
sentence
on
helena
the
guard
spat
disgustedly
fine
lot
of
wrecks
we
re
getting
she
complained
not
like
the
old
days
they
used
to
send
real
men
she
glowered
at
ross
and
bernie
holding
their
commitment
papers
loosely
in
her
hand
and
for
treason
too
she
added
used
to
be
it
took
guts
to
commit
a
crime
against
the
she
shook
her
head
then
made
a
noise
of
distaste
and
scribbled
initials
on
the
commitment
papers
she
handed
them
back
to
the
pilot
who
had
brought
them
up
from
azor
who
grinned
waved
and
got
out
of
there
all
right
said
the
guard
we
have
to
take
what
we
get
i
ll
have
to
put
you
two
on
construction
you
ll
never
stand
up
under
hard
work
keep
your
noses
clean
that
s
all
up
at
breakfast
till
work
detail
till
dinner
and
recreation
till
then
lights
out
miss
a
formation
and
you
miss
a
meal
miss
two
and
you
get
punishment
detail
nobody
misses
ross
and
bernie
found
themselves
sharing
a
communal
cell
they
had
all
of
five
minutes
to
look
around
and
get
oriented
then
they
were
out
on
their
first
work
detail
it
wasn
t
so
bad
as
it
sounded
their
shiftmates
were
a
couple
of
dozen
wrecks
assembling
a
sort
of
wall
out
of
sheets
of
perforated
steel
and
bolts
all
the
parts
seemed
well
worn
some
of
the
bolts
hardly
closed
it
took
ross
the
better
part
of
his
first
detail
whispering
when
the
guards
were
looking
the
other
way
to
find
out
why
their
half
of
the
prisoners
were
construction
the
other
half
was
demolition
what
construction
in
the
morning
put
up
demolition
in
the
evening
tore
down
neither
side
was
anxious
to
set
any
speed
records
and
the
guards
without
exception
were
too
bored
to
care
with
any
kind
of
luck
ross
found
he
could
hope
eventually
to
get
a
real
the
minerva
s
radar
signal
or
generating
facilities
working
in
the
kitchens
or
service
shops
perhaps
even
as
an
orderly
in
the
guard
quarters
although
ross
quite
by
accident
chanced
to
see
a
guard
s
orderly
as
he
passed
through
a
corridor
near
the
work
area
a
handkerchief
held
daintily
to
his
nose
and
though
the
orderly
s
clothing
was
neat
and
his
plump
cheeks
indicated
good
eating
the
haunted
expression
in
his
eyes
made
ross
think
twice
the
one
thing
he
could
not
do
according
to
the
testimony
of
every
man
he
spoke
to
was
escape
the
fifth
time
ross
got
that
answer
the
guard
had
stepped
out
of
the
room
ross
took
the
opportunity
to
thrash
the
thing
through
why
he
demanded
back
where
i
come
from
we
ve
got
lots
of
prisons
i
never
heard
of
one
nobody
escaped
the
other
prisoner
laughed
shortly
now
you
have
he
said
go
ahead
try
every
one
of
us
has
tried
one
time
or
another
there
s
only
one
thing
stopping
s
no
place
to
go
you
can
get
past
the
guards
easy
re
lazy
when
they
re
not
either
drunk
or
you
can
roam
around
minerva
all
you
like
you
can
even
get
to
the
spacelock
and
if
you
want
to
you
can
walk
right
through
it
but
not
in
a
spacesuit
because
there
aren
t
any
on
board
and
not
into
the
tender
that
brings
us
up
from
azor
because
you
aren
t
built
ross
looked
puzzled
not
built
right
that
s
right
there
s
telescreens
and
locks
built
into
that
tender
the
pilot
brings
you
up
but
once
she
couples
with
minerva
the
controls
lock
and
the
only
way
they
get
unlocked
is
when
three
women
in
three
different
substations
down
on
azor
push
the
rc
releases
and
they
don
t
do
that
until
they
look
in
their
screens
and
see
that
everybody
who
has
turned
up
in
the
tender
has
stripped
down
to
nothing
at
all
and
every
one
of
them
is
female
any
further
questions
he
grinned
wryly
don
t
even
think
about
plastic
surgery
if
that
happens
to
cross
your
mind
he
said
we
have
two
men
here
who
tried
it
you
don
t
have
much
equipment
here
you
can
t
do
a
neat
enough
ross
gulped
hadn
t
given
it
a
thought
he
assured
the
other
man
you
can
t
even
hide
away
in
a
trunk
or
something
the
prisoner
shook
his
head
aren
t
any
trunks
everything
s
one
to
minerva
pilots
and
guards
no
men
ever
go
back
when
you
die
you
go
out
the
a
ship
same
with
everything
else
that
they
want
to
get
rid
ross
thought
hard
what
if
what
if
you
re
sent
up
here
and
all
and
then
some
new
evidence
turns
up
and
you
re
found
innocent
don
t
they
send
you
back
then
found
innocent
the
man
looked
at
ross
pityingly
man
you
new
hey
he
called
hey
chuck
this
guy
wants
to
know
what
happens
if
they
find
out
back
on
azor
that
he
s
innocent
chuck
exploded
into
laughter
wiping
his
eyes
he
walked
over
to
ross
thanks
he
grinned
haven
t
had
a
good
laugh
in
fifteen
i
don
t
see
that
that
s
so
funny
ross
said
defensively
after
all
the
judge
can
make
a
mistake
none
of
us
is
shut
up
chuck
hissed
holding
a
hand
over
ross
s
mouth
do
you
want
to
get
us
all
in
trouble
some
of
these
guys
would
rat
to
the
guards
for
an
extra
hunk
of
bread
the
judges
never
make
a
and
his
lips
formed
the
silent
word
he
let
go
of
ross
and
stood
back
but
didn
t
walk
away
he
scratched
his
head
say
he
said
you
ask
some
stupid
questions
where
are
you
from
anyhow
ross
said
bitterly
what
s
the
use
you
won
t
believe
me
i
happen
to
be
from
a
place
called
halsey
s
planet
which
is
a
good
long
distance
from
here
about
as
far
as
light
will
travel
in
two
hundred
years
if
that
gives
you
an
idea
i
came
here
in
an
is
a
ship
you
don
t
know
what
that
is
of
course
but
i
did
it
was
a
mistake
i
admit
it
but
here
i
somewhat
to
ross
s
surprise
chuck
didn
t
laugh
again
he
looked
dubious
and
he
scratched
his
head
some
more
but
he
didn
t
laugh
to
the
other
prisoner
he
said
what
do
you
think
sam
sam
shrugged
so
maybe
we
were
wrong
he
observed
ross
demanded
wrong
about
what
well
chuck
said
hesitantly
there
s
a
guy
here
named
flarney
he
s
a
pretty
old
by
now
must
be
at
least
ninety
and
he
s
been
here
a
good
long
time
dunno
how
long
but
he
talks
crazy
just
like
you
no
offense
he
added
it
s
just
that
we
all
thought
he
d
gone
but
maybe
we
re
wrong
his
eyes
narrowed
unless
the
two
of
you
are
both
or
trying
to
kid
us
or
ross
said
urgently
i
swear
chuck
there
s
no
such
thing
it
s
true
who
s
this
flarney
where
does
he
say
he
came
from
who
can
make
sense
out
of
what
he
says
all
i
know
is
he
talked
a
lot
about
something
faster
than
light
that
s
crazy
that
s
like
saying
slower
than
dark
or
bigger
than
green
or
something
but
i
don
t
know
maybe
it
means
believe
me
chuck
it
does
where
is
this
i
see
him
chuck
looked
uncertain
well
sure
that
is
you
can
see
him
all
right
but
it
isn
t
going
to
do
you
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
of
good
because
he
s
dead
died
yesterday
they
re
going
to
pitch
him
out
into
space
sometime
sam
said
this
is
when
whitker
flips
one
week
without
his
old
pal
flarney
and
he
ll
begin
to
look
funny
two
weeks
and
he
starts
acting
funny
three
and
he
s
talking
funny
and
the
guards
begin
to
crack
down
i
give
him
a
month
to
get
shot
down
and
heaved
through
the
old
pal
ross
demanded
who
s
this
whitker
where
can
i
get
in
touch
with
him
him
and
flarney
were
both
latrine
orderlies
that
s
where
they
put
the
feeble
old
men
mopping
and
polishing
number
two
head
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
old
buzzard
has
his
re
supposed
to
get
a
hank
of
cellosponge
per
man
per
day
but
he
s
always
fresh
out
you
slip
him
your
saccharine
ration
every
once
in
a
ross
asked
the
way
to
number
two
head
and
the
routine
but
it
was
an
hour
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
ask
the
hulking
guard
for
permission
sure
sonny
she
boomed
i
ll
show
you
the
way
need
any
help
no
thanks
ma
am
he
said
hastily
and
she
roared
with
laughter
so
did
the
members
of
the
construction
gang
it
must
have
been
an
ancient
gag
he
hurried
on
his
way
thinking
dark
and
bloody
thoughts
whitker
he
asked
a
tottering
ancient
who
nodded
and
drowsed
amid
the
facilities
of
the
head
the
old
man
looked
up
blearily
and
squeaked
fresh
out
fresh
out
you
should
ve
saved
some
from
that
s
all
right
i
m
a
new
man
here
i
want
to
ask
you
about
your
friend
whitker
bowed
his
head
and
began
to
cry
noiselessly
i
m
sorry
whitker
i
heard
but
there
s
something
we
can
do
about
flarney
was
a
man
he
must
have
told
you
that
so
am
ross
from
halsey
s
he
hadn
t
the
faintest
idea
as
to
whether
any
of
this
was
getting
through
to
the
ancient
it
seems
flarney
and
i
were
both
on
the
same
mission
finding
out
how
and
why
planets
were
dropping
out
of
communication
you
and
he
used
to
talk
a
lot
they
tell
me
did
he
ever
tell
you
anything
about
that
whitker
looked
up
and
squeaked
dimly
oh
yes
all
the
time
i
humored
him
he
was
an
old
man
you
know
and
now
he
s
the
tears
leaked
from
his
rheumy
eyes
and
traced
the
sad
furrows
beside
his
nose
was
he
getting
through
what
did
he
whitker
about
the
old
man
said
equals
e
to
the
minus
that
damned
formula
again
but
what
does
it
mean
whitker
what
did
he
say
it
meant
ross
softly
urged
the
old
man
looked
surprised
genes
he
asked
himself
hazily
generations
i
don
t
remember
but
you
go
to
earth
young
man
flarney
said
know
and
know
what
to
do
about
it
too
which
is
more
than
he
did
his
very
words
young
man
ross
didn
t
dare
stay
longer
furthermore
he
suspected
that
the
old
man
s
attention
span
had
been
exhausted
he
started
from
the
room
with
a
muttered
thanks
and
was
stopped
at
the
door
by
whitker
s
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
re
a
good
boy
whitker
squeaked
ross
found
himself
walking
down
the
corridor
with
an
enormous
wad
of
cellosponge
in
his
hand
the
bunks
were
hard
but
that
didn
t
matter
dormitories
were
the
outermost
layer
of
the
hulk
pseudogravity
varies
inversely
as
the
fourth
power
of
the
distance
and
the
field
generator
was
conventionally
located
near
minerva
s
center
when
your
relative
weight
is
normal
you
can
sleep
deliciously
on
a
gravel
driveway
this
was
the
dormitory
s
only
attractive
feature
otherwise
it
was
too
many
steel
slabs
tiered
and
spotted
too
close
too
many
unwashed
males
too
much
weary
snoring
the
only
things
in
short
supply
were
headroom
and
air
not
everybody
slept
insomniacs
turned
and
grunted
those
who
had
given
up
the
struggle
talked
from
bunk
to
bunk
in
considerately
low
tones
bernie
muttered
from
a
bunk
facing
ross
s
i
wonder
if
she
made
ross
knew
what
he
meant
unlikeliest
thing
in
the
world
he
said
but
i
think
she
went
fast
and
never
knew
what
hit
he
thought
of
the
formula
and
they
d
know
on
know
what
to
do
about
it
earth
the
enigma
from
which
all
planetary
peoples
were
supposed
to
be
derived
dot
on
the
traditional
master
charts
which
and
to
which
no
longliners
ever
seemed
to
travel
haarland
had
told
him
no
ship
had
in
recent
centuries
ever
reported
again
after
setting
out
for
earth
another
world
sunk
in
barbarism
but
flarney
had
that
was
not
data
that
was
the
confused
recollections
of
a
very
old
man
possibly
based
on
the
confused
recollections
of
another
very
old
man
perhaps
it
had
got
mixed
up
with
the
semilegendary
origin
story
poor
sweet
helena
he
hoped
it
had
happened
fast
that
she
had
been
thinking
of
some
pleasant
prospect
on
halsey
s
planet
in
her
naïve
way
she
d
think
it
just
around
the
corner
a
mere
matter
of
following
instructions
so
thought
ross
the
pessimist
in
his
gloom
he
had
forgotten
that
this
was
exactly
what
it
was
in
his
snobbishness
he
never
realized
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
most
frightful
arrogance
in
assuming
that
what
he
could
do
she
could
not
in
his
ignorance
he
was
not
aware
that
since
navigation
began
every
new
instrument
every
technique
has
drawn
the
shuddery
warnings
of
savants
that
uneducated
skippers
working
by
rote
could
not
be
expected
to
master
these
latest
fruits
of
that
uneducated
skippers
since
navigation
began
have
cheerfully
adopted
new
instruments
and
techniques
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
and
that
never
once
have
the
shuddery
warnings
been
justified
by
the
facts
up
the
aisle
somebody
was
saying
in
a
low
argumentative
tone
i
saw
the
drum
myself
naturally
it
was
marked
dulsheen
creme
but
the
guards
here
never
did
give
a
damn
whether
their
noses
were
dull
or
bright
enough
to
flag
down
a
freighter
and
i
don
t
think
they
ve
suddenly
changed
it
was
booze
i
tell
you
fifty
liters
of
gawd
the
hangovers
we
ll
all
have
to
watch
our
steps
i
hope
they
don
t
do
anything
worse
than
getting
quietly
drunk
in
their
quarters
those
orderlies
ll
get
a
workout
but
who
cares
what
happens
to
an
orderly
they
haven
t
been
on
a
real
tear
since
i
ve
been
lucky
you
let
s
hope
they
don
t
bust
loose
tonight
it
s
a
break
in
the
monotony
those
girls
play
rough
five
prisoners
died
last
they
beat
them
up
one
of
what
about
the
others
oh
oh
liters
you
said
bernie
began
to
whimper
not
again
not
those
i
swear
i
ll
throw
myself
through
the
spacelock
if
they
make
a
pass
at
me
ross
isn
t
there
anything
we
can
do
seems
not
bernie
maybe
they
won
t
come
in
or
if
they
do
maybe
they
ll
pass
you
by
there
certainly
isn
t
any
place
to
a
raucous
female
voice
roared
through
the
annunciator
bed
check
five
minutes
boys
anybody
got
any
li
l
thing
to
do
down
the
hall
better
do
it
now
see
you
hiccup
and
drunken
giggle
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
ross
suddenly
and
spontaneously
acted
like
a
hero
with
the
exception
that
he
felt
like
a
silly
ass
through
it
all
got
an
idea
he
muttered
get
out
of
your
he
pulled
the
wad
of
cellosponge
old
whitker
s
present
from
his
pocket
and
yanked
it
in
half
one
for
him
and
one
for
bernie
the
pullover
said
faintly
thanks
but
i
don
t
have
ross
didn
t
bother
to
answer
he
was
carefully
fluffing
the
stuff
out
to
its
maximum
dimensions
he
unzipped
his
coveralls
and
began
wadding
them
with
cellosponge
i
get
it
bernard
said
softly
he
stepped
out
of
his
garment
and
followed
suit
in
less
than
a
minute
they
had
creditable
dummies
lying
on
their
bunks
the
others
watched
their
activity
with
emotions
ranging
between
awe
and
envy
one
giant
of
a
man
proclaimed
grimly
to
whoever
cared
to
listen
these
are
a
couple
of
smart
guys
i
wish
them
luck
and
i
want
you
guys
to
know
that
i
will
personally
break
the
back
of
any
sneaking
rat
who
tips
off
a
guard
about
sure
ox
sure
came
a
muted
chorus
arranged
in
a
fetal
sleeping
position
face
down
the
dummies
astonished
even
their
creators
it
would
take
a
lucky
look
in
a
fair
light
to
note
that
the
heads
were
earless
fibrous
globes
they
ll
do
ross
snapped
come
on
they
walked
quietly
from
the
dormitory
in
their
singlet
underwear
toward
the
dormitory
past
it
into
the
corridor
through
a
doorless
opening
into
a
storeroom
piled
with
crates
of
rations
this
ll
do
ross
said
quietly
they
ducked
into
a
small
cavern
formed
by
sloppy
issuing
of
stock
and
hunched
down
the
dummies
will
fool
the
bed
check
it
s
only
a
sweep
with
a
tv
system
if
the
guards
do
raid
the
dormitory
tonight
we
ll
have
to
count
on
them
ignoring
the
dummies
or
thinking
they
re
a
joke
or
being
too
busy
with
other
things
to
care
they
ll
be
drunk
after
all
then
in
the
morning
things
ll
be
plenty
disorganized
we
ll
be
able
to
sneak
back
into
that
ll
be
that
for
a
matter
of
years
they
can
t
often
bribe
the
pilots
with
enough
to
guarantee
a
real
ripsnorting
drunk
now
try
and
get
some
sleep
there
s
nothing
more
we
can
they
actually
did
doze
off
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
then
were
awakened
by
drunken
war
whoops
it
s
them
bernie
wailed
shut
up
they
re
heading
for
the
dormitory
we
re
safe
bernie
echoed
derisively
safe
until
when
ross
threatened
him
with
the
side
of
his
hand
and
bernie
was
quiet
though
his
lips
were
mumbling
soundlessly
the
guards
lurched
giggling
past
and
ross
said
we
ll
sneak
into
the
lockroom
there
won
t
be
anybody
there
tonight
at
least
we
ll
get
a
night
s
big
deal
grumbled
bernie
but
he
followed
complaining
inarticulately
to
himself
ross
thought
tiredly
all
this
work
for
a
night
s
sleep
and
saw
the
dreadful
procession
of
days
and
nights
and
years
ahead
they
reached
the
lockroom
and
stumbled
in
breathlessly
dearie
two
guards
playing
a
card
game
on
the
floor
with
a
ring
of
empty
bottles
around
them
looked
up
in
drunken
delight
dearie
repeated
the
bigger
of
the
two
angela
what
got
ross
said
stupidly
but
you
shouldn
t
be
the
guard
made
a
clumsy
pass
at
fluffing
up
her
back
hair
and
giggled
duty
comes
first
dearie
angela
just
lock
that
door
will
you
the
other
guard
scrambled
unevenly
to
her
feet
and
weaved
over
to
the
door
it
was
locked
before
ross
or
bernie
could
move
the
big
guard
stood
up
too
leering
at
bernie
wow
she
said
new
merchandise
just
be
patient
dearie
we
ve
got
a
little
something
to
attend
to
in
a
couple
of
minutes
but
we
ll
have
of
time
after
then
things
began
to
happen
rapidly
there
was
angela
the
guard
inarticulate
drunk
she
waved
bonelessly
at
a
brightly
flickering
light
on
the
far
side
of
the
lockroom
there
was
the
other
guard
reaching
out
for
bernie
with
one
hand
pawing
at
a
bottle
with
the
other
there
was
ross
a
paralyzed
spectator
and
there
was
bernie
bernie
s
eyes
bulged
wide
as
the
guard
came
toward
him
he
babbled
hysterically
no
nonononono
i
said
i
d
kill
myself
and
he
the
big
guard
and
leaped
for
the
lock
door
ross
suddenly
came
to
life
bernie
he
bellowed
hold
it
don
t
jump
but
it
was
too
late
the
one
guard
sprawling
the
other
staggering
helplessly
across
the
floor
bernie
was
clear
he
scrabbled
at
the
lockwheels
spun
them
open
ross
tensed
himself
for
the
sudden
awful
rush
of
expanding
air
he
leaped
after
bernie
just
as
bernie
flung
the
lock
door
open
and
jumped
ross
jumped
after
there
was
no
rush
of
air
they
were
not
in
space
around
them
was
no
ripping
sucking
void
no
flaming
backdrop
of
stars
around
them
were
six
walls
and
a
wesley
board
and
helena
peering
at
them
and
delighted
well
she
said
was
fast
ross
said
helena
hanging
from
the
acceleration
loops
smiled
maternally
oh
it
was
nothing
she
said
ross
don
t
you
think
we
re
far
enough
away
yet
ross
said
hopelessly
all
right
and
cut
the
drive
the
starship
hung
in
space
in
the
limbo
between
stars
azor
minerva
and
the
rest
were
behind
far
out
of
range
of
challenge
helena
wriggled
free
from
the
loops
and
rubbed
her
arms
where
the
retaining
straps
had
gripped
them
after
all
she
said
demurely
you
me
how
to
run
the
ship
and
ross
i
m
not
quite
ross
said
but
what
ross
it
isn
t
as
if
i
were
some
sort
of
brainless
little
thing
that
had
never
run
a
machine
in
her
life
my
goodness
she
wrinkled
her
nose
should
remember
all
those
days
in
the
dye
vats
don
t
you
think
i
had
to
learn
a
little
something
about
machines
ross
swore
incredulously
to
compare
those
clumsy
constructs
of
wheels
and
rollers
with
the
subtle
subelectronic
flows
of
the
wesley
to
make
it
work
he
said
unbelievingly
and
the
minerva
helped
you
vector
in
they
gave
you
the
and
radared
your
course
helena
turned
to
bernie
who
was
staring
dazedly
around
him
are
you
all
right
dear
she
asked
ross
turned
his
back
on
them
and
faced
the
wesley
christmas
tree
of
controls
don
t
question
it
he
told
himself
take
a
miracle
for
what
it
is
god
wanted
you
out
of
minerva
god
moves
in
most
mysterious
ways
his
wonders
to
perform
anyway
they
had
to
get
going
when
the
court
had
exiled
helena
in
the
starship
they
had
gone
through
the
customary
rituals
not
only
was
everything
that
looked
like
a
weapon
gone
along
with
all
but
a
teacup
of
fuel
for
the
auxiliary
jets
but
the
food
locker
was
stripped
entirely
he
put
everything
else
out
of
his
mind
and
began
to
calculate
a
setting
bernie
said
over
his
shoulder
home
huh
that
place
you
call
halsey
s
planet
ross
shook
his
head
not
this
time
i
got
this
far
and
i
m
still
alive
maybe
i
can
finish
the
job
anyway
i
ll
try
the
first
solid
suggestion
i
ve
had
ever
since
i
took
off
was
what
that
old
he
ignored
a
little
gasp
from
helena
back
on
if
flarney
had
lived
he
would
have
gone
there
we
ll
go
there
he
finished
manipulating
the
calculator
and
began
to
set
it
up
on
the
board
he
said
the
name
of
the
place
it
took
ross
a
while
to
learn
a
lesson
but
when
he
learned
it
it
stuck
this
time
he
promised
himself
they
sneaked
into
the
solar
system
that
held
fabulous
old
earth
from
far
outside
the
ecliptic
where
the
chance
of
radar
detection
was
least
they
came
to
a
relative
dead
halt
millions
of
miles
from
the
planet
and
cautiously
scanned
the
surrounding
volume
of
space
with
their
own
radar
no
ships
seemed
to
be
in
space
earth
s
solar
system
turned
out
to
be
a
trivial
affair
only
five
planets
scarcely
a
moons
among
them
none
of
the
planets
except
earth
itself
was
anything
like
inhabitable
hold
tight
said
ross
grimly
i
m
not
so
good
at
this
fine
he
cautiously
applied
power
along
a
single
vector
the
starship
leaped
and
bucked
he
corrected
with
another
and
the
distant
sun
swelled
in
their
view
plates
with
frightening
rapidity
the
alarm
beeps
bleated
furiously
and
the
automatic
cutoff
restored
all
controls
to
neutral
ross
sweating
picked
himself
up
from
the
floor
and
staggered
back
to
the
panel
helena
said
carefully
you
re
doing
ross
but
if
you
d
like
to
take
over
for
a
ross
swallowed
his
pride
and
stood
back
after
one
stare
of
wasn
t
even
calculating
gripped
the
loops
and
closed
his
eyes
and
waited
for
death
there
was
a
punishing
bump
and
his
eyes
flew
open
helena
was
looking
at
him
apologetically
you
would
have
done
it
better
she
lied
but
anyway
we
re
ross
lied
of
course
but
i
m
glad
you
had
the
practice
where
are
we
helena
silently
showed
him
the
radar
plot
earth
it
seemed
had
a
confusing
multiplicity
of
continents
they
were
on
one
in
the
northern
hemisphere
a
large
one
as
earth
s
continents
went
and
smack
in
the
middle
of
it
it
was
night
on
their
side
of
earth
just
then
and
by
the
plot
a
largish
city
was
only
a
dozen
or
so
miles
away
okay
said
ross
wearily
landing
party
away
helena
you
stay
here
while
bernie
and
helena
said
simply
ross
stared
at
her
a
minute
then
shrugged
all
right
then
bernie
will
stay
i
will
not
said
bernie
clearly
it
was
time
for
a
showdown
ross
roared
who
s
the
captain
here
anyway
you
are
helena
said
promptly
as
long
as
i
don
t
have
to
stay
here
yeah
said
bernie
ross
said
he
thought
for
a
while
and
then
said
well
let
s
all
they
thought
it
was
a
wonderful
idea
earth
wasn
t
a
very
unusual
of
green
sand
and
purple
vegetation
either
the
master
star
chart
was
wrong
or
the
gravity
meter
was
off
the
former
strangely
enough
gave
earth
s
gravity
as
and
the
latter
as
a
whopping
ten
per
cent
discrepancy
further
the
principal
inert
gas
in
earth
s
atmosphere
was
according
to
the
master
chart
s
planetary
supplement
nitrogen
and
according
to
the
ship
s
instruments
was
indubitably
neon
a
terrific
aurora
polaris
display
constantly
flickering
in
the
northern
sky
bore
that
out
but
the
gap
between
the
chart
and
the
facts
didn
t
particularly
worry
ross
as
they
swung
along
overland
so
the
chart
was
off
or
perhaps
things
had
changed
this
to
flarney
via
place
where
people
knew
about
the
formula
where
his
questions
would
be
answered
after
this
he
thought
happily
it
s
off
to
halsey
s
planet
and
an
unspecified
glorious
future
revered
as
the
savior
of
humanity
instead
of
a
lousy
yards
clerk
pushing
invoices
around
and
helena
he
thought
sentimentally
he
turned
to
smile
at
her
and
found
she
and
bernie
were
giggling
listen
you
two
captain
ross
roared
haven
t
you
learned
anything
yet
what
s
the
good
of
us
exploring
if
we
stroll
along
with
our
silly
heads
in
the
clouds
not
paying
attention
do
you
realize
that
this
place
may
be
as
dangerous
as
azor
or
worse
helena
said
don
t
interrupt
what
this
outfit
needs
is
some
up
you
two
have
got
to
accept
your
responsibilities
keep
alert
be
on
the
lookout
any
single
thing
out
of
the
ordinary
may
be
a
deathtrap
watch
helena
was
looking
not
at
ross
but
over
his
shoulder
bernie
was
making
strangled
noises
and
pointing
ross
turned
behind
him
stood
a
mechanical
monstrosity
vaguely
recognizable
as
a
truck
its
motor
faintly
humming
a
man
leaned
darkly
from
the
cab
and
transfixed
them
to
the
ground
with
a
powerful
spotlight
from
the
dazzling
circle
of
light
his
voice
came
hasty
and
furtive
thought
it
was
two
women
and
a
man
but
i
guess
you
re
the
ones
ugh
those
faces
on
you
yes
you
re
the
ones
get
in
the
light
blinked
out
when
their
eyes
adjusted
to
the
dimmer
illumination
of
the
stars
and
the
aurora
display
they
saw
a
side
door
in
the
body
of
the
truck
standing
open
too
one
of
the
long
slim
gun
barrels
with
which
the
truck
seemed
copiously
supplied
swiveled
to
cover
them
ross
stupidly
read
aloud
a
sign
on
the
truck
jones
company
finest
tile
on
jones
a
specialty
rugs
fit
for
a
jones
yeah
the
man
said
yeah
yeah
just
don
t
try
to
buy
any
get
in
for
jones
sake
if
i
d
of
known
you
were
i
wouldn
t
of
taken
this
job
for
a
million
joneses
cash
get
in
his
voice
was
hysterical
and
the
gun
covering
them
moved
ominously
if
this
is
a
he
began
to
shrill
get
in
ross
said
shakily
to
the
others
they
climbed
in
and
the
door
slammed
violently
and
automatically
helena
began
to
cry
in
a
preoccupied
sort
of
way
and
bernie
began
a
long
mumbling
inventory
of
his
own
mental
weaknesses
for
ever
getting
involved
in
this
crackbrained
imbecilic
there
were
windows
in
the
truck
body
and
ross
turned
from
one
to
another
he
saw
the
guns
on
the
cab
telescope
into
stubs
the
stubs
fold
into
the
mounts
the
mounts
smoothly
descend
flush
with
the
sheet
metal
he
saw
the
cursing
driver
manipulate
a
dozen
levers
as
the
car
began
to
glide
across
the
green
sand
with
vegetation
finally
through
the
rear
window
he
saw
three
figures
racing
across
the
sand
waving
their
arms
rapidly
being
left
behind
all
he
could
make
out
was
that
they
seemed
to
be
two
women
and
a
man
helena
was
wailing
softly
i
am
ugly
and
just
because
we
re
young
and
we
re
strangers
isn
t
any
reason
to
go
around
insulting
from
bernie
shut
up
ross
said
softly
before
i
bang
both
your
heads
they
stared
thank
you
we
ve
got
to
think
what
s
this
spot
we
re
in
what
can
we
do
about
it
i
don
t
have
any
contact
name
for
earth
and
obviously
this
fellow
picked
us
up
by
mistake
i
saw
two
women
and
a
what
he
said
now
trying
to
catch
up
with
us
he
seems
to
be
some
kind
of
criminal
otherwise
why
a
disguised
why
floor
coverings
but
don
t
try
to
buy
any
and
jones
seems
to
be
the
name
of
the
local
political
subdivision
the
name
of
the
local
deity
and
the
currency
that
s
important
it
points
to
a
rigid
of
course
or
possibly
his
dynasty
what
course
of
action
should
we
take
kick
it
around
helena
what
do
you
think
he
shouldn
t
have
said
we
were
ugly
she
pouted
isn
t
important
women
ross
said
grimly
if
you
ll
kindly
forget
the
trivial
affront
to
your
vanity
perhaps
we
can
figure
something
helena
said
stubbornly
but
he
we
re
not
what
if
they
just
we
are
because
they
all
look
alike
and
we
don
t
look
like
them
ross
collapsed
after
a
long
pause
during
which
he
tried
and
almost
failed
to
control
his
temper
he
said
slowly
thank
you
helena
you
re
wrong
of
course
but
it
was
a
contribution
you
see
you
can
t
build
up
such
a
wild
theory
from
the
few
facts
his
voice
was
beginning
to
choke
with
anger
it
isn
t
reasonable
and
it
isn
t
really
any
help
in
fact
it
s
the
stupidest
imitation
of
reasoning
i
have
city
bernard
croaked
pointing
the
jolting
ride
had
become
smoother
and
gliding
past
the
windows
were
green
tiled
buildings
and
street
lights
fine
ross
said
bitterly
we
had
a
few
clear
minutes
to
think
and
now
we
find
they
were
wasted
by
the
crackpot
dissertation
of
a
female
and
my
reasonable
attempt
to
show
her
the
elements
of
logical
he
put
his
head
in
his
hands
and
tried
to
ignore
them
tried
to
reason
it
out
but
the
truck
made
a
couple
of
sharp
turns
and
jolted
to
a
stop
the
door
opened
and
the
voice
of
their
driver
said
again
from
behind
a
flashlight
s
dazzling
circle
out
walk
ahead
of
they
did
into
a
room
with
eight
people
in
it
whom
they
studied
in
amazement
every
one
of
the
eight
was
exactly
the
same
feet
every
one
had
straight
red
hair
of
exactly
the
same
shade
sprouting
from
an
identical
hairline
every
one
had
precisely
the
same
but
their
sixteen
eyes
were
the
identical
blue
under
sixteen
identical
eyebrows
head
to
toe
they
were
duplicates
one
of
them
exactly
the
same
voice
as
the
truckdriver
s
so
you
want
to
be
joneses
do
you
he
said
absolutely
but
we
took
their
give
it
back
reasonable
changes
yes
but
look
at
them
we
can
t
give
it
back
look
what
we
spent
already
anyway
sam
it
sounded
like
sam
to
ross
sam
look
at
some
of
the
work
you
ve
done
already
you
can
do
it
i
doubt
if
anybody
else
could
but
you
ross
felt
his
eyes
crossing
and
gave
up
the
effort
of
trying
to
tell
which
jones
was
speaking
to
which
even
the
clothing
was
nearly
pantaloons
scarlet
jacket
black
cummerbund
sash
black
shoes
then
he
noticed
that
one
who
seemed
to
be
named
a
frilly
shirt
of
white
under
the
scarlet
jacket
only
a
lacy
edge
showed
at
the
open
collar
but
where
his
was
white
the
others
were
all
muted
pastels
of
pink
and
green
sam
said
coldly
i
know
nobody
else
can
do
it
anybody
else
who
else
there
a
jones
with
a
frill
of
chartreuse
pursed
his
lips
well
he
said
thoughtfully
there
s
northside
tim
northside
tim
jones
sam
mimicked
eight
of
his
jobs
are
in
the
stockade
right
now
paraffin
for
jones
s
still
uses
paraffin
to
mold
a
face
i
know
sam
but
after
all
these
people
need
help
if
you
won
t
do
it
for
them
what
s
left
sam
shrugged
morosely
he
said
then
he
shook
his
head
sighed
and
came
forward
to
look
at
the
three
travelers
with
an
expression
of
revulsion
he
said
ross
hesitated
hold
it
he
said
sharply
to
helena
already
half
out
of
her
coveralls
sir
there
may
have
been
some
mistake
would
you
mind
explaining
just
what
you
propose
to
do
the
usual
thing
sam
said
irritably
fix
your
hair
build
up
your
frames
level
you
off
at
standard
jones
height
the
works
though
i
must
say
he
added
bitterly
i
never
saw
such
unpromising
specimens
in
my
life
how
the
jones
have
you
managed
to
stay
out
of
trouble
this
long
whose
garrets
have
you
been
hiding
in
ross
licked
his
lips
you
mean
he
said
you
want
to
make
us
look
more
like
you
gentlemen
is
that
it
want
sam
repeated
in
bafflement
over
his
shoulder
he
roared
ben
what
kind
of
creeps
are
you
saddling
me
with
ben
looking
worried
said
holy
jones
sam
i
don
t
get
it
either
it
was
a
perfectly
normal
deal
this
guy
came
up
to
me
in
jones
s
joint
and
made
a
pitch
he
knew
the
setup
all
right
and
he
had
the
money
with
him
six
hundred
joneses
cold
cash
and
it
wasn
t
funny
money
his
face
clouded
i
did
think
though
he
mentioned
that
he
said
two
women
and
one
man
but
paul
jones
picked
them
up
right
at
the
rendezvous
so
it
must
ve
been
the
right
he
glowered
suspiciously
at
ross
and
the
others
come
to
think
of
it
he
said
maybe
not
tell
you
what
sam
you
just
sit
tight
here
for
twenty
minutes
or
and
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
one
of
the
other
joneses
said
curtly
sit
ross
bernie
and
helena
found
chairs
lined
up
against
a
wall
they
sat
a
different
jones
rummaged
in
a
stack
of
papers
on
a
table
he
handed
something
to
each
of
them
relax
he
advised
obediently
the
three
spacefarers
opened
the
magazines
he
gave
them
when
they
were
settled
most
of
the
joneses
after
a
whispered
conference
went
out
the
one
that
was
left
said
no
talking
if
we
made
a
mistake
we
re
sorry
meanwhile
you
do
what
you
re
ross
found
that
his
magazine
was
called
it
seemed
to
be
a
periodical
devoted
to
entertaining
news
and
gossip
of
sports
fashion
and
culture
he
stared
at
an
article
headed
be
glad
the
people
s
police
are
watching
you
but
the
words
made
little
sense
he
tried
to
think
but
somehow
he
couldn
t
find
a
point
at
which
to
grasp
the
flickering
mass
of
impressions
that
were
circling
through
his
brain
nothing
seemed
to
make
a
great
deal
of
sense
any
more
and
ross
suddenly
realized
that
he
was
very
very
tired
his
mind
an
utter
blank
he
sat
and
waited
it
was
twenty
minutes
and
a
bit
more
then
the
door
flew
open
and
half
a
dozen
joneses
burst
in
even
at
first
sight
ross
could
tell
that
three
of
them
were
newcomers
for
one
thing
two
were
women
and
the
third
though
tall
and
gangling
had
a
nose
a
full
centimeter
shorter
than
any
of
the
others
and
his
hair
was
crisply
curled
all
right
you
peepeece
snarled
the
first
jones
you
found
what
you
were
looking
try
to
get
out
helena
did
the
talking
it
wasn
t
ross
s
idea
but
when
her
heel
crunched
down
on
his
instep
he
was
too
startled
to
object
and
from
then
on
he
didn
t
get
a
chance
to
get
a
word
in
edgewise
he
had
to
admit
that
her
act
was
getting
across
with
the
audience
long
before
she
had
finished
reporting
their
meeting
their
flight
to
azor
the
escape
from
minerva
and
the
flight
here
most
of
the
joneses
had
put
their
guns
away
and
all
were
showing
signs
of
stupefaction
then
she
finished
we
saw
this
truck
and
that
very
man
picked
us
up
and
so
we
re
here
on
earth
and
honest
to
goodness
that
s
the
exact
there
was
silence
while
the
joneses
looked
at
each
other
then
the
jones
sam
with
the
white
shirt
front
stepped
forward
hold
still
my
dear
he
ordered
helena
bravely
stood
rigid
while
the
surgeon
raked
searchingly
through
the
roots
of
her
hair
peered
into
her
eyes
expertly
traced
the
configuration
of
her
ribs
he
stepped
back
shaken
one
thing
is
for
sure
he
told
the
others
they
re
not
peepeece
not
with
those
bones
they
d
never
get
ben
jones
beat
his
forehead
and
moaned
how
do
i
get
into
these
things
he
demanded
one
of
the
female
joneses
said
shrilly
we
didn
t
expect
anything
like
this
we
re
honest
joneses
shut
up
ben
jones
roared
what
about
the
other
two
sam
they
all
right
too
oh
for
jones
s
sake
ben
sam
said
disgustedly
just
look
at
them
will
you
do
you
think
the
police
would
take
in
a
height
deviation
like
that
he
pointed
to
or
a
scarecrow
like
that
ross
stung
opened
his
mouth
to
object
but
swiftly
closed
it
again
nobody
was
paying
much
attention
to
him
anyhow
except
as
exhibit
a
so
what
do
we
do
ben
demanded
sam
shrugged
the
first
thing
we
do
he
said
wearily
is
to
take
care
of
our
uh
clients
here
we
get
them
out
of
the
way
and
then
we
decide
what
to
do
he
looked
around
at
the
other
joneses
if
you
three
will
come
this
way
he
said
we
ll
finish
up
your
job
and
get
you
back
home
i
needn
t
remind
you
of
course
that
if
you
should
happen
to
mention
anything
you
ve
seen
here
tonight
to
the
peepeece
it
his
voice
was
cut
off
by
the
closing
door
before
ross
could
catch
the
nature
of
the
threat
ben
jones
stayed
behind
scowling
to
himself
you
people
got
any
joneses
he
demanded
abruptly
you
mean
money
not
any
at
all
helena
said
honestly
ross
could
have
kicked
her
ben
jones
growled
deep
in
his
throat
always
it
happens
to
me
he
complained
i
suppose
we
re
going
to
have
to
feed
you
well
helena
said
diffidently
we
haven
t
eaten
in
a
long
ben
jones
swore
to
his
god
whose
name
was
jones
but
he
stepped
to
the
door
and
ordered
food
when
it
came
it
was
surprisingly
good
each
of
the
three
with
their
diverse
backgrounds
found
it
delicious
while
they
were
eating
ben
jones
sat
watching
them
refreshing
himself
from
time
to
time
with
a
greenish
bubbling
liquid
out
of
a
jug
he
offered
some
to
ross
who
clutched
his
throat
as
though
he
d
swallowed
molten
steel
ben
jones
guffawed
till
his
eyes
ran
first
taste
of
jones
s
juice
hey
kind
of
gets
right
down
inside
doesn
t
it
he
wiped
his
eyes
then
sobered
i
guess
you
people
are
all
right
he
admitted
what
i
m
going
to
do
with
you
i
don
t
know
i
can
t
take
you
to
earth
and
i
can
t
keep
you
here
and
i
can
t
throw
you
out
on
the
peepeece
would
have
you
in
the
stockade
in
ten
ross
startled
said
aren
t
we
on
earth
naw
ben
jones
said
disgustedly
didn
t
you
hear
me
you
re
on
jones
halfway
between
jones
s
forks
and
jonesgrad
but
you
came
pretty
close
at
that
earth
s
about
fifty
miles
out
the
jones
pike
past
jonesgrad
turn
right
at
jonesboro
ross
said
bewilderedly
the
planet
earth
is
fifty
miles
along
the
pike
not
a
planet
ben
jones
said
it
s
an
old
city
kind
of
nobody
lives
there
any
more
the
peepeece
don
t
permit
it
i
ve
never
been
there
but
they
say
it
s
kind
of
you
know
different
some
of
the
he
seemed
actually
to
be
are
as
much
as
fifteen
twenty
stories
high
and
the
walls
aren
t
even
all
green
excuse
me
he
added
looking
at
helena
sam
jones
returned
and
said
to
ben
it
s
all
right
all
finished
trivial
alterations
maybe
they
could
have
gone
along
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
on
wigs
and
we
don
t
tell
them
that
do
we
and
anyway
now
they
won
t
worry
healy
jones
the
older
man
for
instance
very
bright
fellow
but
it
seems
he
was
working
as
a
s
apprentice
afraid
to
take
the
master
s
test
afraid
to
change
his
line
of
be
noticed
and
he
heaved
a
tremendous
sigh
and
poured
himself
a
tremendous
slug
of
the
green
fluid
ben
jones
gave
ross
a
cynical
wink
and
shrug
look
at
my
hand
the
surgeon
exploded
it
was
shaking
he
gulped
the
jones
juice
and
poured
himself
another
nothing
physical
he
said
neurosis
the
subconscious
coldly
counting
up
my
crimes
and
coldly
imposing
and
executing
sentence
i
m
a
surgeon
so
my
hand
he
drank
jones
is
not
mocked
he
said
broodingly
jones
is
not
mocked
think
those
three
are
going
to
be
happy
think
they
re
going
to
be
folded
in
jones
s
bosom
just
because
they
re
joneses
externally
now
no
watch
them
five
years
ten
years
maybe
they
ll
sentence
themselves
to
be
hateful
lice
and
wonder
why
nobody
loves
them
maybe
they
ll
sentence
themselves
to
penal
servitude
and
wonder
why
everybody
pushes
them
around
why
they
haven
t
the
guts
to
hit
is
not
mocked
he
told
the
jug
of
green
liquid
ignoring
the
others
and
drank
again
ben
jones
said
softly
to
them
come
on
and
led
them
into
an
adjoining
room
furnished
with
sleeping
pads
he
said
apologetically
the
doctor
s
nerves
are
shot
tonight
trouble
is
he
s
too
me
i
can
take
it
or
leave
it
his
laugh
had
a
little
too
much
bravado
in
it
there
s
a
little
bit
of
nonjones
in
the
best
of
us
i
always
not
to
the
doctor
and
not
when
he
s
hitting
the
jones
he
shrugged
cynically
and
said
what
the
hell
equals
e
to
the
minus
ross
had
him
by
his
shirt
frill
say
that
again
ben
jones
shoved
him
away
what
s
the
matter
with
you
boy
i
m
sorry
would
you
please
repeat
that
formula
what
you
said
he
hastily
amended
when
the
word
formula
obviously
failed
to
register
ben
jones
repeated
the
formula
wonderingly
what
does
it
mean
ross
demanded
i
ve
been
chasing
the
damned
thing
across
the
he
hastily
filled
ben
jones
in
on
its
previous
appearances
well
ben
jones
said
it
means
what
it
says
of
course
i
mean
it
s
obvious
isn
t
it
he
studied
their
faces
and
added
uncertainly
isn
t
it
what
does
it
mean
to
ben
ross
asked
softly
why
what
it
means
to
anybody
pal
right
s
right
wrong
s
wrong
jones
is
in
his
heaven
conform
or
means
morality
man
what
else
could
it
mean
ross
then
proceeded
to
make
an
unmannerly
nuisance
of
himself
he
grilled
their
involuntary
host
mercilessly
shrugging
aside
all
attempted
diversions
of
the
talk
into
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
the
three
visitors
he
ignored
protestations
that
ben
was
no
jonesologist
jones
knew
and
drilled
in
by
the
time
ben
jones
exploded
stamped
out
and
locked
them
in
for
the
night
he
had
elicited
the
following
everybody
knew
the
formula
they
were
taught
it
at
their
mother
s
knee
it
was
recited
antiphonally
before
and
after
jones
meetings
ben
knew
it
was
right
of
course
and
some
day
he
was
going
to
get
right
with
jones
and
live
up
to
it
but
not
just
yet
because
if
he
didn
t
make
money
in
the
prosthesis
racket
somebody
else
would
the
formula
was
everywhere
on
the
lintels
of
public
buildings
hanging
in
classrooms
and
on
the
bedroom
walls
of
the
most
old
ladies
where
they
could
see
its
comforting
message
last
thing
at
night
and
first
thing
in
the
morning
from
a
book
well
yes
he
guessed
so
sure
it
was
in
the
book
of
joneses
but
who
could
say
whether
that
was
where
it
started
most
people
thought
it
was
just
handed
down
way
back
during
the
war
the
war
of
the
joneses
of
course
anyway
in
the
war
the
last
of
the
holdouts
against
the
formula
had
been
destroyed
no
he
didn
t
know
anything
about
the
war
no
not
his
grandfather
s
time
or
his
grandfather
s
grandfather
s
time
long
ago
that
war
was
maybe
there
were
records
in
the
old
museum
in
earth
the
city
of
course
not
some
damn
planet
he
never
heard
of
after
ben
jones
slammed
out
and
the
room
darkened
helena
and
bernie
exchanged
comforting
words
from
adjoining
sleeping
pads
to
ross
s
intense
displeasure
they
fell
asleep
and
at
last
he
fell
asleep
still
churning
over
the
problem
when
he
woke
he
found
that
evidently
the
doctor
sam
jones
had
stumbled
in
during
the
night
and
passed
out
on
the
pad
next
to
him
the
white
frill
was
stiff
and
green
with
dried
jones
juice
helena
and
bernie
still
slept
he
tried
the
door
it
was
locked
but
there
was
a
tantalizing
hum
of
voices
beyond
it
he
put
his
ear
to
the
cold
steel
the
fruits
of
his
eavesdropping
were
scanty
but
alarming
em
down
mumble
found
someplace
never
killed
yet
mumble
prosthesis
s
sake
it
s
their
lives
or
mumble
mumble
time
to
get
scared
mumble
peepeece
are
you
and
then
apparently
the
speakers
moved
out
of
range
ross
was
cold
with
sweat
and
there
was
an
abnormal
hollow
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
that
breakfast
would
never
fill
he
spun
around
as
a
jones
voice
croaked
painfully
hear
anything
good
stranger
the
surgeon
looking
very
dilapidated
was
sitting
up
and
regarding
him
through
bloodshot
eyes
they
re
talking
about
killing
us
he
said
shortly
they
are
not
really
intelligent
sam
jones
said
wearily
they
were
just
bright
enough
to
entangle
me
to
the
point
where
i
had
to
work
for
to
keep
me
copiously
supplied
with
that
green
stuff
i
haven
t
the
intelligence
to
use
in
ross
said
how
d
you
like
to
break
away
from
this
sam
jones
mutely
extended
his
hand
it
trembled
like
a
leaf
he
said
for
his
own
inscrutable
reason
jones
grants
me
steadiness
of
hand
during
an
operation
designed
to
frustrate
his
grand
design
he
then
overwhelms
me
with
a
titanic
thirst
for
oblivion
to
my
there
s
no
design
ross
said
or
if
there
is
luckily
this
planet
is
a
trifling
part
of
it
i
have
never
heard
of
such
arrogant
in
my
life
you
flyspecks
in
your
shabby
corner
of
the
galaxy
think
your
own
mess
is
the
pattern
of
universal
life
you
re
wrong
i
ve
seen
life
elsewhere
and
i
know
it
isn
the
doctor
passed
his
trembling
hand
over
his
eyes
jones
is
not
mocked
he
croaked
equals
e
to
the
minus
you
can
t
fight
stranger
you
can
t
fight
ross
realized
he
was
silently
crying
behind
his
covering
hand
he
said
much
more
gently
it
s
nothing
you
have
to
fight
it
s
something
you
have
to
he
told
sam
jones
of
his
two
previous
encounters
with
the
formula
the
doctor
looked
up
his
eyes
full
of
wonder
ross
said
how
would
you
like
to
be
free
doctor
free
of
your
shaking
hands
free
of
your
guilt
free
of
these
killers
how
would
you
like
to
know
the
truth
the
doctor
said
faintly
if
i
ross
pressed
the
museum
in
earth
city
get
me
records
facts
anything
about
the
war
of
the
joneses
if
there
s
any
meaning
to
the
formula
it
ll
have
to
lie
in
that
it
seems
there
was
a
battle
about
its
interpretation
and
we
know
who
won
let
s
find
out
what
the
other
side
said
get
me
in
he
was
thinking
of
the
disgraceful
war
of
fanaticism
that
had
marred
his
own
planet
s
history
the
doctor
s
weak
jones
jaw
was
firming
up
though
his
eyes
were
still
haunted
stall
your
killer
friends
doctor
ross
urged
tell
them
you
can
use
us
for
experiments
that
ll
cut
the
cost
of
the
operations
that
ought
to
bring
them
around
and
get
me
the
facts
to
be
free
the
doctor
said
wistfully
he
said
after
a
pause
i
ll
try
and
rapped
a
code
series
on
the
steel
door
the
doctor
said
with
weak
belligerence
who
do
you
think
i
am
jones
i
to
leave
your
friends
behind
i
had
enough
trouble
getting
those
hoods
to
let
me
take
along
after
all
i
m
not
a
ross
said
sullenly
okay
he
glowered
out
of
the
car
window
and
spat
out
a
tendril
of
red
hair
that
had
come
loose
from
the
fringe
surrounding
his
mouth
the
trouble
with
a
false
beard
was
that
it
itched
worse
than
the
real
article
worse
than
any
torment
ross
had
ever
known
but
at
least
ross
externally
and
at
extreme
range
was
enough
of
a
jones
to
pass
a
casual
glance
and
what
would
helena
and
bernie
be
thinking
now
he
hadn
t
had
a
chance
to
whisper
to
them
they
d
been
just
waking
when
the
doctor
dragged
him
out
ross
put
that
problem
out
of
his
mind
there
were
problems
enough
right
on
hand
he
cautiously
felt
his
red
wig
to
see
if
it
was
on
straight
the
doctor
didn
t
seem
to
look
away
from
his
driving
but
he
said
leave
it
alone
that
s
the
first
thing
the
peepeece
look
for
somebody
who
obviously
isn
t
sure
if
his
hair
is
still
on
or
not
it
won
t
come
umph
said
ross
the
road
was
getting
worse
it
seemed
they
had
passed
no
houses
for
several
miles
now
they
rounded
a
rutted
turn
and
ahead
was
a
sign
stop
restricted
area
ahead
warning
this
road
is
mined
no
traffic
allowed
detour
trespassers
beyond
this
point
will
be
shot
without
further
decree
people
s
commissariat
of
culture
and
solidarity
the
doctor
spat
contemptuously
out
the
window
and
roared
past
ross
said
hey
oh
relax
said
the
doctor
that
s
just
the
cultureniks
nobody
pays
any
attention
to
ross
swallowed
and
sat
as
lightly
as
possible
on
the
green
leather
cushion
of
the
car
by
the
time
they
had
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
he
began
to
feel
a
little
reassured
that
the
doctor
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
then
the
doctor
swerved
sharply
to
miss
a
rusted
hulk
and
almost
skidded
off
the
road
he
swore
and
manhandled
the
wheel
until
they
were
back
on
the
straightaway
white
lipped
ross
asked
what
was
that
car
grunted
the
doctor
hit
a
mine
silly
fools
ross
squawked
but
you
shut
up
the
doctor
ordered
tensely
that
was
weeks
ago
they
haven
t
had
a
chance
to
lay
new
mines
since
pause
i
the
car
roared
on
ross
closed
his
eyes
limply
abandoning
himself
to
what
was
in
store
but
if
it
was
bad
to
see
what
was
going
on
the
roaring
swerving
jolting
race
was
ten
times
worse
with
his
eyes
closed
he
opened
them
again
in
time
to
see
another
sign
flash
past
gone
before
he
could
read
it
what
was
that
he
demanded
what
s
the
difference
the
doctor
grunted
want
to
go
back
well
ross
thought
for
a
moment
do
we
have
to
go
this
fast
though
if
we
want
to
get
there
crossed
a
peepeece
radar
screen
ten
miles
back
they
ll
be
chasing
us
by
oh
i
see
ross
said
weakly
look
doc
tell
me
one
do
they
make
this
place
so
hard
to
get
to
tabu
area
the
doctor
said
shortly
not
why
not
allowed
because
it
s
not
allowed
don
t
want
people
poking
through
the
old
why
not
just
put
the
old
records
in
a
safe
burn
the
damn
things
up
because
they
didn
t
that
s
why
shut
up
expect
me
to
tell
you
why
the
peepeece
do
anything
they
don
t
know
themselves
it
isn
t
jonesly
to
destroy
i
ross
shut
up
he
leaned
against
the
window
letting
the
air
rush
over
his
head
they
were
moving
through
forest
purplish
squatty
trees
with
long
rustling
leaves
the
sky
overhead
was
crisp
and
cool
looking
it
was
still
early
morning
ross
exhaled
a
long
breath
back
on
halsey
s
planet
he
would
be
getting
up
about
now
rising
out
of
a
soft
warm
bed
taking
his
leisurely
time
about
breakfast
climbing
into
a
comfortable
car
to
make
his
way
to
the
spaceport
where
he
was
safe
respected
and
at
home
damn
haarland
at
least
ross
thought
some
sort
of
a
pattern
was
beginning
to
shape
up
the
planets
were
going
out
of
communication
each
for
its
own
reason
but
wasn
t
there
a
basic
that
was
the
same
in
each
case
wasn
t
there
some
overall
explanation
that
covered
all
the
facts
pointed
to
a
way
out
he
sat
up
straight
as
they
approached
a
string
of
little
signs
he
scanned
them
worriedly
as
they
rolled
past
workers
peasants
joneses
by
these
presents
know
if
you
don
t
stop
in
spite
of
this
to
hell
will
blow
ye
duck
the
doctor
yelled
crouching
down
in
the
seat
and
guiding
the
careening
car
with
one
hand
ross
startled
followed
his
example
but
not
before
he
saw
that
this
was
an
automatic
gun
mounted
a
few
yards
past
the
last
sign
there
was
a
stuttering
roar
from
the
gun
and
a
splatter
of
metal
against
the
armored
sides
of
the
car
the
doctor
sat
up
again
as
soon
as
the
burst
had
hit
evidently
only
one
was
to
be
feared
yah
yah
he
jeered
at
the
absent
builders
of
the
gun
lousy
can
t
punch
their
way
through
a
tin
can
ross
gasping
got
up
just
in
time
to
see
the
last
sign
in
the
series
by
order
of
people
s
democratic
council
of
arts
sciences
small
arms
he
said
wildly
they
can
t
even
write
a
poem
properly
did
you
notice
the
first
and
third
line
surprisingly
the
doctor
glanced
at
him
and
laughed
with
a
note
of
respect
he
took
a
hand
off
the
wheel
to
pat
ross
on
the
shoulder
you
ll
make
a
jones
yet
my
boy
he
promised
don
t
worry
about
these
things
i
told
you
this
place
was
restricted
this
stuff
isn
t
worth
bothering
ross
found
that
he
was
able
to
smile
there
was
a
point
he
realized
with
astonishment
where
courage
came
easily
it
was
the
only
thing
left
he
sat
up
straighter
and
breathed
the
air
more
deeply
then
it
happened
they
rounded
another
curve
the
doctor
slammed
on
the
brakes
suspended
overhead
across
the
road
was
a
single
big
sign
that
s
all
jones
s
police
the
car
bucked
slewed
around
and
skidded
the
wheels
locked
but
not
in
time
to
keep
it
from
sliding
into
the
pit
road
wide
and
four
feet
deep
that
was
dug
in
front
of
them
ross
heard
the
axles
crack
and
the
tires
blow
but
the
springing
of
the
car
was
equal
to
the
challenge
he
was
jarred
clear
in
the
air
and
tumbled
to
the
floor
in
a
heap
but
no
bones
were
broken
painfully
he
pushed
the
door
open
and
crawled
out
the
doctor
limped
after
and
the
two
of
them
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
pit
looking
at
the
ruin
of
their
car
that
one
said
the
doctor
was
worth
bothering
he
motioned
ross
to
silence
and
cocked
an
ear
was
there
a
distant
roaring
sound
like
another
car
following
on
the
road
they
had
traveled
ross
wasn
t
sure
but
the
doctor
s
expression
convinced
him
peepeece
he
said
briefly
from
here
on
it
s
on
foot
they
won
t
follow
beyond
here
but
let
s
get
out
of
sight
they
ll
beyond
here
if
they
see
us
ross
stared
unbelievingly
this
is
earth
he
asked
the
doctor
fanned
himself
and
blew
that
s
it
he
said
looking
around
curiously
heard
a
lot
about
it
but
i
ve
never
been
here
before
he
explained
isn
t
it
he
nudged
ross
indicating
a
shattered
concrete
structure
beside
them
on
the
road
notice
that
toll
booth
he
whispered
slyly
eight
sides
ross
said
wearily
yes
mighty
funny
look
doc
why
don
t
you
sort
of
wander
around
by
yourself
for
a
while
that
big
thing
up
ahead
is
the
museum
you
were
talking
about
isn
t
it
the
doctor
squinted
his
eyes
were
unnaturally
bright
and
his
breathing
was
fast
but
he
was
making
an
attempt
to
seem
casual
in
the
presence
of
these
manifold
obscenities
of
design
he
licked
his
lips
he
marveled
why
yes
i
think
that
s
the
museum
you
go
on
up
there
like
you
say
i
ll
uh
sort
of
see
what
there
is
to
see
jones
yes
he
staggered
off
staring
from
ribald
curbing
to
scatological
wall
in
an
orgy
of
prurience
ross
sighed
and
walked
through
the
deserted
streets
to
the
stone
building
that
bore
on
its
cracked
lintel
the
one
surviving
word
this
was
all
wrong
he
was
almost
certain
earth
to
be
a
planet
not
a
city
but
still
the
museum
had
to
have
the
answers
on
its
moldering
double
doors
was
a
large
lead
seal
he
read
surplus
information
repository
access
denied
to
unauthorized
but
the
seal
had
been
forced
by
somebody
one
of
the
doors
swung
free
creaking
ross
invoked
the
forcer
of
the
door
if
could
do
it
he
went
in
and
stumbled
over
a
skeleton
presumably
that
of
the
last
entrant
the
skull
had
been
crushed
by
a
falling
beam
there
was
some
sort
of
mechanism
trigger
a
spring
a
release
hook
all
had
rusted
badly
and
the
spring
had
lost
its
tension
over
the
years
a
century
two
five
ross
prayed
that
any
similar
mantraps
had
likewise
rusted
solid
and
cautiously
inched
through
the
dismal
hall
of
the
place
ready
for
a
backward
leap
at
the
first
whisper
of
a
concealed
mechanism
in
action
it
was
unnecessary
the
place
exploring
room
after
room
he
realized
slowly
that
he
was
stripping
off
history
in
successive
layers
the
first
had
been
the
road
lackadaisically
planned
to
ensure
that
mere
inquisitiveness
would
be
discouraged
there
had
been
no
real
denial
of
access
for
there
was
almost
no
possibility
that
anybody
would
care
to
visit
the
place
next
the
seal
and
the
mantraps
an
earlier
period
somebody
had
once
said
this
episode
is
closed
this
history
is
determined
we
have
all
reached
agreement
only
a
dangerous
or
frivolous
meddler
would
seek
to
rake
over
these
dead
and
then
prying
into
the
museum
ross
found
the
era
during
which
agreement
had
been
reached
during
which
it
still
was
necessary
to
insist
and
demonstrate
and
cajole
the
outer
rooms
and
open
shelves
were
testimonials
to
jones
there
were
books
of
persuasive
books
divided
usually
into
three
sections
human
jonesology
would
be
a
painstaking
effort
to
determine
the
exact
physical
and
mental
tolerances
of
a
jones
anatomical
atlases
minutely
gave
femur
lengths
cranial
angles
eye
color
to
an
angstrom
hair
thickness
to
a
micron
moral
jonesology
treated
of
the
dangers
of
deviating
from
these
physical
and
more
elastic
mental
specifications
here
the
formula
appeared
again
repeatedly
invoked
but
never
explained
already
it
was
a
truism
and
sacred
jonesology
was
a
series
of
assertions
concerning
the
nature
of
the
jones
in
whose
image
all
other
joneses
were
created
subdivisions
of
the
open
shelves
held
works
on
geographical
jonesology
the
distribution
across
the
planet
of
joneses
and
similar
works
ross
went
looking
for
a
lower
layer
of
history
and
found
it
in
a
bale
of
crumbling
pamphlets
comrades
we
must
now
proceed
to
consolidate
our
victory
an
infantile
political
disorder
on
the
fallacy
of
jonesism
in
one
country
these
ross
devoured
they
added
up
to
the
tale
of
a
savage
political
battle
among
the
victors
of
a
greater
war
clemency
was
advocated
and
condemned
extermination
of
the
opposition
was
casually
mentioned
the
cultural
faction
and
the
biological
faction
had
obviously
been
long
locked
in
a
death
struggle
across
the
face
of
each
pamphlet
stood
a
similar
logotype
the
formula
it
was
enigmatically
mentioned
in
one
pamphlet
which
almost
incomprehensibly
advanced
the
claims
of
the
biological
faction
to
supremacy
among
the
joneses
united
let
us
never
forget
comrades
that
the
initiation
of
the
great
struggle
was
not
caused
by
our
will
or
by
the
will
of
our
sincere
and
valiant
opponents
the
culturists
the
inexorable
law
of
nature
t
o
was
the
begetter
of
that
holocaust
from
which
our
planet
has
emerged
was
it
now
the
entrance
to
a
musty
airless
wing
had
once
been
bricked
up
the
mortar
was
crumbling
and
a
few
bricks
had
fallen
above
the
arched
doorway
a
sign
said
military
archives
on
the
floor
was
a
fallen
metal
plaque
whose
inscription
said
simply
dead
storage
he
kicked
the
loose
bricks
down
and
stepped
through
that
was
it
the
place
was
lightless
except
for
the
daylight
filtering
through
the
violated
archway
ross
hauled
maps
and
orders
and
period
newspapers
and
military
histories
and
handbooks
into
the
corridor
in
armfuls
and
spread
them
on
the
floor
it
took
only
minutes
for
him
to
realize
that
he
had
his
answer
he
ran
into
the
street
and
shouted
for
the
doctor
together
they
pored
over
the
papers
occasionally
reading
aloud
choice
bits
wonderingly
the
simplest
statement
of
the
problem
they
found
was
in
the
why
we
fight
pamphlet
issued
for
the
enlisted
men
of
the
provisional
north
continent
government
army
what
is
a
jones
the
pamphlet
asked
rhetorically
a
jones
is
just
a
human
being
the
same
as
you
and
i
dismiss
rumors
that
a
jones
is
supernatural
or
unkillable
with
a
laugh
when
you
hear
them
they
arose
because
of
the
extraordinary
resemblance
of
one
jones
to
another
putting
a
bullet
through
one
jones
in
a
skirmish
and
seeing
another
one
rise
up
and
come
at
you
with
a
bayonet
is
a
chilling
experience
in
the
confusion
of
battle
it
may
seem
that
the
dead
jones
rose
and
attacked
but
this
is
not
the
case
never
let
the
rumor
pass
unchallenged
and
never
fail
to
report
habitual
how
did
the
joneses
get
that
way
many
of
you
were
too
young
when
this
long
war
began
to
be
aware
of
the
facts
since
then
wartime
disruption
of
education
and
normal
communications
facilities
has
left
you
in
the
dark
this
is
the
authoritative
statement
in
simple
language
that
explains
why
we
fight
this
planet
was
colonized
presumably
from
the
planet
earth
the
famous
earth
archives
building
incidentally
is
supposed
to
derive
its
puzzling
name
from
this
fact
it
is
presumed
that
the
number
of
colonists
was
originally
small
probably
in
the
hundreds
though
the
number
of
human
beings
on
the
planet
increased
enormously
as
the
generations
passed
genetically
the
population
remained
small
the
same
ones
heredity
units
were
combined
and
reshuffled
in
varying
combinations
but
no
new
ones
were
added
now
it
is
a
law
of
genetics
that
in
small
populations
variations
tend
to
smooth
out
and
every
member
of
the
population
tends
to
become
like
every
other
member
unfixed
genes
are
lost
as
the
generations
pass
the
end
product
of
this
process
would
theoretically
be
a
population
in
which
every
member
had
exactly
the
same
genes
as
every
other
member
this
is
a
practical
impossibility
but
the
joneses
whom
we
fight
are
a
tragic
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
the
process
need
not
be
pushed
to
its
ultimate
extreme
to
dislocate
the
life
of
a
planet
and
cause
endless
misery
to
its
dwellers
from
our
very
earliest
records
there
have
been
joneses
it
is
theorized
that
this
gangling
redheaded
type
was
well
represented
aboard
the
original
colonizing
ship
but
some
experts
believe
one
jones
type
and
the
workings
of
chance
would
be
sufficient
to
produce
the
unhappy
situation
of
some
years
ago
joneses
were
everywhere
among
us
and
not
as
now
withdrawn
to
south
continent
and
organized
into
a
ruthless
aggressor
nation
they
made
up
about
thirty
per
cent
of
the
population
and
had
become
a
closely
knit
organization
devoted
to
mutual
help
they
held
the
balance
of
political
power
in
every
election
from
the
municipal
to
the
planetary
level
and
virtually
monopolized
production
and
finance
there
were
fanatics
and
among
them
who
readily
exploited
a
rising
tide
of
discontent
over
a
series
of
curbing
laws
finally
pushed
through
by
a
planetary
majority
united
at
last
in
against
the
rapacity
and
ruthless
of
the
joneses
the
joneses
withdrew
en
masse
to
south
continent
some
sincerely
wished
them
well
others
scoffed
at
the
secession
as
a
sulky
and
childish
gesture
only
a
handful
of
citizens
guessed
the
terrible
truth
and
were
laughed
at
for
their
pains
five
years
after
their
withdrawal
the
joneses
returned
across
the
vandemeer
peninsula
and
the
war
had
begun
a
final
word
there
has
been
much
loose
talk
among
the
troops
about
the
slogan
of
the
joneses
which
goes
t
o
some
uninformed
people
actually
believe
it
is
an
invocation
which
gives
the
joneses
supernatural
power
and
invulnerability
it
is
not
it
is
merely
an
ancient
and
formula
in
genetics
which
quantitatively
describes
the
loss
of
unfixed
genes
from
a
population
by
mouthing
this
formula
the
joneses
are
simply
expressing
in
a
compact
way
their
ruthless
determination
that
all
genes
except
theirs
shall
disappear
from
the
planet
and
the
joneses
alone
survive
in
the
formula
t
means
the
number
of
genes
after
the
lapse
of
t
years
o
means
the
original
number
of
genes
e
means
the
base
of
the
natural
system
of
logarithms
and
n
means
number
of
the
surgeon
said
slowly
and
with
wonder
so
was
my
god
he
stretched
out
his
hands
before
him
the
fingers
were
ross
left
him
and
paced
the
corridor
uneasily
fine
now
he
knew
lost
genes
in
genetically
small
populations
on
halsey
s
planet
some
fertility
gene
no
doubt
on
azor
a
gene
that
provides
men
with
the
backbone
required
to
come
out
ahead
in
the
incessant
war
of
the
genders
bernie
was
a
gutless
character
here
all
too
many
genes
determining
somatotype
on
the
planets
that
had
dropped
out
of
communication
who
knew

genes
one
thing
was
clear
any
was
bad
for
the
survival
of
a
planetary
colony
evolution
out
in
a
billion
years
a
working
mechanism
man
man
exhibited
a
vast
range
of
variation
which
was
why
he
survived
almost
any
conceivable
catastrophe
reduce
man
to
a
single
type
and
he
is
certain
to
succumb
sooner
or
later
to
the
inevitable
disaster
that
his
one
type
can
not
cope
with
the
problem
now
stated
clearly
was
bigger
than
he
had
dreamed
and
now
he
knew
only
the
the
solution
go
to
earth
well
he
had
tried
there
had
been
no
flaw
in
his
calculations
no
failure
in
setting
up
the
wesley
panel
was
jones
not
earth
the
city
was
only
a
city
not
the
planet
that
the
star
charts
logged
and
the
planet
beyond
all
other
considerations
was
less
like
earth
than
any
conceivable
chart
error
could
account
for
gravitation
wrong
atmosphere
wrong
flora
and
fauna
wrong
so
eliminate
the
impossible
and
what
remains
however
unlikely
is
true
so
there
had
been
a
flaw
in
his
calculations
and
the
way
to
check
that
once
and
for
all
was
to
get
back
to
the
starship
ross
wheeled
and
went
back
into
the
book
room
doc
he
called
how
do
we
get
out
of
here
the
answer
was
on
their
bellies
they
trudged
through
the
forest
for
hours
skirting
the
road
hiding
whenever
a
suspicious
noise
gave
warning
that
someone
might
be
in
the
vicinity
the
peepeece
knew
they
were
in
the
woods
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
and
as
soon
as
they
got
past
the
tabu
area
they
had
to
crawl
it
was
well
past
dark
before
ross
and
the
doctor
scratched
and
aching
got
to
the
tiny
hamlet
of
by
the
light
from
the
one
window
in
the
village
that
gave
any
signs
of
life
the
doctor
took
a
single
horrified
look
at
ross
and
shuddered
you
wait
here
he
ordered
hide
under
a
bush
or
beard
rubbed
ross
watched
the
doctor
rap
on
the
door
and
be
admitted
he
couldn
t
hear
the
conversation
that
followed
but
he
saw
the
doctor
s
hand
go
to
his
pocket
then
clasp
the
hand
of
the
figure
in
the
doorway
that
was
the
language
all
the
galaxy
understood
ross
realized
he
only
hoped
that
the
householder
was
an
honest
one
who
would
stay
bribed
instead
of
informing
the
peepeece
on
them
it
was
beyond
doubt
that
their
descriptions
had
long
since
been
broadcast
the
road
must
have
been
lined
with
tv
scanners
on
the
way
in
the
door
opened
again
and
the
doctor
walked
briskly
out
he
strode
out
into
the
street
walked
half
a
dozen
paces
down
the
road
and
waited
for
ross
to
catch
up
with
him
okay
the
doctor
whispered
they
ll
pick
us
up
in
half
an
hour
down
the
road
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
let
s
what
about
the
man
you
were
talking
to
ross
asked
won
t
he
turn
us
in
the
doctor
chuckled
i
gave
him
a
drink
of
jones
s
juice
out
of
my
private
stock
he
said
no
he
won
t
turn
anybody
in
at
least
not
until
he
wakes
ross
nodded
invisibly
in
the
dark
he
had
a
thought
and
suppressed
it
but
it
wouldn
t
stay
down
cautiously
he
let
it
seep
through
his
subconscious
again
and
looked
it
over
from
every
angle
no
there
wasn
t
any
doubt
of
it
things
were
definitely
looking
up
ben
jones
roared
just
what
the
hell
do
you
think
you
re
doing
doc
the
doctor
pushed
ross
through
the
doorway
and
turned
to
face
the
other
jones
he
asked
mildly
what
you
heard
me
ben
jones
blustered
i
let
you
out
with
this
one
and
maybe
i
made
a
mistake
at
that
but
i
don
t
intend
to
let
you
get
out
of
here
with
all
three
of
them
what
are
you
trying
to
get
away
with
anyhow
the
doctor
didn
t
change
his
mild
expression
he
took
a
short
unhurried
step
forward
ben
jones
reeled
back
from
the
slap
his
mouth
open
hand
to
his
face
hey
he
squawked
the
doctor
said
levelly
i
m
telling
you
this
just
one
time
ben
t
cross
you
ve
got
the
guns
but
i
ve
got
he
held
up
his
spread
hands
you
can
shoot
me
i
won
t
deny
that
but
you
can
t
make
me
do
your
dirty
work
for
you
from
now
on
things
go
my
these
three
people
with
my
own
life
with
the
bootleg
plastic
surgery
we
do
to
keep
you
in
armored
cars
or
else
there
won
t
any
plastic
ben
jones
swallowed
and
ross
could
see
the
man
fighting
himself
he
said
after
a
moment
no
reason
to
act
sore
doc
haven
t
we
always
got
along
the
only
thing
is
maybe
you
don
t
realize
how
dangerous
these
shut
up
said
the
doctor
right
boys
the
other
two
joneses
in
the
room
shuffled
and
looked
uncomfortable
one
of
them
said
don
t
get
mad
ben
but
it
kind
of
looks
as
if
he
s
right
we
and
the
doc
had
a
little
talk
before
you
got
here
it
figures
you
have
to
admit
it
he
does
the
work
we
ought
to
let
him
have
something
to
say
about
the
look
that
ben
jones
gave
him
was
pure
poison
but
the
man
stood
up
to
it
and
in
a
minute
ben
jones
looked
away
sure
he
said
distantly
you
go
right
ahead
doc
we
ll
talk
this
over
again
later
on
when
we
ve
all
had
a
chance
to
cool
the
doctor
nodded
coldly
and
followed
ross
out
helena
and
bernie
suitably
jonesified
for
the
occasion
were
already
in
the
car
ross
and
the
doctor
jumped
in
with
them
and
they
drove
away
now
that
the
strain
was
relaxed
a
bit
the
doctor
was
panting
but
there
was
a
grin
on
his
lips
he
said
happily
i
ve
been
waiting
five
years
for
this
day
ross
asked
is
it
all
right
they
won
t
chase
after
us
no
not
ben
jones
he
has
his
own
way
of
handling
things
now
if
we
were
stupid
enough
to
go
back
there
after
he
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
the
others
without
me
around
that
would
be
something
different
but
we
aren
t
going
ross
s
eyes
widened
not
even
you
doc
especially
not
the
doctor
concentrated
on
his
driving
presently
if
i
take
you
to
the
rendezvous
can
you
find
your
ship
from
there
he
asked
sure
said
ross
confidently
and
to
our
space
had
never
looked
better
they
hung
half
a
million
miles
off
jones
and
ross
fumbled
irritatedly
with
the
wesley
panel
while
the
other
three
stood
around
and
made
helpful
suggestions
he
set
up
the
integrals
for
earth
just
as
he
had
set
them
up
once
before
the
plot
came
out
the
same
he
transferred
the
computations
to
the
controls
and
checked
it
against
the
record
in
the
log
the
same
the
ship
should
have
gone
straight
as
a
geodesic
arrow
to
the
planet
earth
instead
he
found
by
the
star
atlas
it
had
gone
in
almost
the
other
direction
entirely
to
the
planet
of
jones
he
threw
his
pencil
across
the
room
and
swore
i
don
t
get
it
he
complained
it
s
probably
broken
ross
helena
told
him
seriously
you
know
how
machines
are
they
re
doing
something
funny
just
when
you
least
expect
ross
bit
down
hard
on
his
answer
to
that
bernie
contributed
his
morsel
and
even
sam
jones
whose
race
had
lost
even
the
memory
of
spaceflight
had
a
suggestion
ross
swore
at
them
all
then
took
time
to
swear
at
the
board
at
the
starship
at
haarland
at
wesley
and
most
of
all
at
himself
helena
turned
her
back
pointedly
she
said
to
bernie
the
way
ross
acts
sometimes
you
d
honestly
think
he
was
the
one
who
d
run
this
thing
why
my
goodness
i
you
can
t
on
that
silly
board
didn
t
i
have
just
exactly
the
same
experience
with
it
myself
ross
gritted
his
teeth
and
doggedly
started
all
over
again
with
the
computations
for
earth
then
he
did
a
slow
helena
he
whispered
what
experience
did
you
have
why
just
the
same
as
now
don
t
you
ross
when
you
and
bernie
were
in
jail
and
i
had
to
come
rescue
you
what
happened
ross
shouted
my
goodness
ross
don
t
at
me
there
was
that
silly
light
flashing
all
the
time
it
was
driving
me
out
of
my
well
i
knew
well
that
i
wasn
t
going
to
get
anywhere
if
it
was
going
to
act
like
so
i
ross
eyes
glazed
robotlike
lifted
the
cover
off
the
main
wesley
unit
down
at
the
socket
of
the
alarm
signal
shorting
out
two
delicately
machined
helices
that
were
a
basic
part
of
the
wesley
drive
wedged
between
an
eccentric
vernier
screw
and
a
curious
crystalline
lattice
hairpin
he
picked
it
out
and
stared
at
it
unbelievingly
he
marveled
it
says
in
the
manual
on
no
account
should
any
alterations
be
made
in
any
part
of
the
wesley
driving
assembly
by
any
technician
under
a
she
didn
t
like
the
alarm
going
off
so
she
fixed
it
with
a
helena
giggled
and
appealed
to
bernie
doesn
t
he
you
she
asked
ross
s
eyes
were
glazed
and
his
hands
worked
convulsively
kill
he
muttered
advancing
on
helena
kill
kill
help
she
screamed
the
two
men
managed
to
subdue
ross
with
the
aid
of
a
needle
from
jones
s
helena
was
in
tears
and
tried
to
explain
to
the
others
just
for
no
reason
at
she
got
only
icy
stares
after
a
while
she
sulkily
began
setting
up
the
wesley
board
for
the
earth
jump
ross
awoke
clearheaded
and
alert
helena
and
bernie
were
looking
at
him
apprehensively
he
understood
and
said
grudgingly
sorry
i
flipped
i
didn
t
mean
to
scare
you
everything
seemed
to
go
they
smothered
him
with
relieved
protestations
that
they
understood
perfectly
and
helena
wouldn
t
stick
hairpins
into
the
wesley
drive
ever
again
even
if
the
ship
hadn
t
blown
up
even
if
she
had
rescued
the
men
from
anyway
she
said
happily
we
re
off
earth
at
least
it
s
to
be
earth
according
to
the
he
unkinked
himself
and
studied
the
planet
through
a
vision
screen
at
its
highest
magnification
the
apparent
distance
was
one
mile
nothing
was
hidden
from
him
golly
he
said
impressed
science
makes
you
realize
what
backward
gropers
we
obviously
they
had
it
down
there
on
the
pleasant
green
and
blue
planet
science
white
towering
cities
whose
spires
were
laced
by
flying
inexplicably
decorated
with
something
that
looked
like
cooling
fins
huge
superstreamlined
vehicles
lazily
coursing
the
roads
and
skies
long
cities
slowly
heaving
on
the
breasts
of
the
oceans
science
ross
said
reverently
we
re
here
flarney
was
right
helena
bernie
this
is
the
parent
planet
of
us
all
and
maybe
it
isn
t
but
the
people
who
built
those
cities
know
all
the
answers
helena
will
you
please
land
us
sure
ross
shall
i
look
for
a
spaceport
ross
frowned
of
course
do
you
think
people
are
savages
we
ll
go
in
openly
and
take
our
problem
to
them
besides
imagine
the
radar
setup
they
must
have
we
d
never
sneak
through
even
if
we
wanted
helena
casually
fingered
the
controls
there
was
the
sickening
swoop
characteristic
of
her
several
times
repeated
as
she
jerked
them
wildly
across
the
planet
s
orbit
she
explained
over
her
shoulder
i
had
the
darnedest
time
finding
a
really
big
spaceport
on
that
little
radar
there
s
a
one
near
that
coastal
city
whee
that
was
close
there
was
a
big
lake
inland
but
i
didn
t
everybody
be
very
quiet
this
is
the
hard
part
and
i
have
to
ross
hung
on
helena
landed
the
ship
with
her
usual
crash
now
she
said
briskly
we
d
better
allow
a
little
time
for
it
to
cool
down
this
nice
isn
t
it
ross
dragged
himself
bruised
from
the
floor
he
had
to
agree
it
was
nice
the
landing
field
rimmed
by
gracious
light
buildings
with
the
cooling
fins
was
dotted
with
great
silvery
ships
they
didn
t
ross
thought
with
a
twinge
of
irritation
seem
to
be
space
vessels
though
leave
it
to
helena
to
get
them
down
at
some
local
airport
ships
also
he
noticed
were
liberally
studded
with
the
fins
he
peered
at
them
with
puzzlement
and
a
rising
sense
of
excitement
certainly
they
had
a
function
and
that
function
could
only
be
some
sort
of
energy
receptor
could
it
he
imagine
that
it
was
the
cosmic
energy
tap
what
a
bonus
that
would
be
to
bring
back
with
him
and
what
other
marvels
might
this
polished
technology
have
to
give
them
bernie
distracted
him
he
said
hey
ross
here
comes
but
even
bernie
s
tone
was
awed
a
magnificent
vehicle
was
crawling
toward
them
across
the
field
it
was
long
low
with
cooling
fins
multiple
plates
of
silvery
metal
contrasted
with
a
glossy
black
finish
all
about
its
periphery
was
a
lacy
pattern
of
intricate
crumples
and
crinkles
of
metal
as
though
its
skirts
had
been
crushed
and
rumpled
ross
sighed
and
marveled
what
a
production
problem
these
people
had
solved
stamping
those
forms
out
between
dies
then
he
saw
the
faces
of
the
passengers
he
drew
in
his
breath
sharply
godlike
two
men
whose
brows
were
cliffs
of
alabaster
whose
chins
were
strong
with
the
firmness
of
steady
flamelike
wisdom
two
women
whose
calm
lovely
features
made
the
heart
within
him
melt
and
course
the
vehicle
stopped
ten
yards
from
the
open
spacelock
of
the
ship
from
its
tip
gushed
upward
a
fountain
of
sparks
that
flashed
the
gamut
of
the
rainbow
simultaneously
one
of
the
godlike
passengers
touched
the
wheel
and
there
was
a
sweet
piercing
imperative
summons
like
a
hundred
strings
and
brasses
in
unison
helena
whispered
they
want
us
to
come
out
can
t
face
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
steady
he
said
gravely
they
re
only
ross
gripped
that
belief
tightly
he
hardly
dared
permit
himself
to
think
even
for
a
second
that
perhaps
these
people
were
no
longer
merely
human
hoarsely
he
said
we
need
their
help
maybe
we
should
send
doc
jones
out
first
he
s
the
oldest
of
us
and
he
s
the
only
one
you
could
call
a
scientist
he
can
talk
to
them
where
is
he
a
raucous
jones
voice
bellowed
through
the
domed
control
room
who
wansh
ol
doc
hargh
who
wansh
goo
ol
doc
good
old
doc
staggered
into
the
room
obviously
loaded
to
the
gills
by
a
very
enjoyable
backslide
he
began
to
sing
in
seven
a
jones
from
jones
s
valley
he
wandered
into
jones
s
town
to
hold
a
jonesist
rally
he
shocked
the
gents
and
ladies
both
his
talk
was
most
disturbing
he
spoke
of
doors
and
jones
s
eyes
focused
on
helena
he
flushed
m
deeply
sorry
he
mumbled
unf
rgivable
vulgararrity
mom
ntarily
f
rgot
ladies
were
again
that
sweet
summons
sounded
pull
yourself
together
doctor
ross
begged
this
is
earth
the
people
advanced
don
t
disgrace
us
please
jones
s
face
went
pale
and
perspiration
broke
out
scuse
me
he
mumbled
and
staggered
out
again
ross
closed
the
door
on
him
and
said
we
ll
leave
him
he
ll
be
all
right
nothing
s
going
to
happen
he
took
a
deep
breath
we
ll
all
go
out
he
said
unconsciously
ross
and
helena
drew
closer
together
and
joined
hands
they
walked
together
down
the
unfolding
ramp
and
approached
the
vehicle
one
of
the
coolly
lovely
women
scrutinized
them
and
turned
to
the
man
beside
her
she
remarked
melodiously
yuhsehtheybebems
and
laughed
a
silvery
tinkle
panic
gripped
ross
for
a
long
moment
a
thing
he
had
never
considered
but
a
thing
which
he
should
have
realized
would
be
inevitable
of
course
these
and
incomparably
more
advanced
than
the
rest
of
the
peoples
in
the
have
evolved
out
of
the
common
language
into
a
speech
of
their
own
deliberately
or
naturally
rebuilt
to
handle
the
speed
subtlety
and
power
of
their
thoughts
but
perhaps
the
older
speech
was
merely
disused
and
not
lost
he
said
formally
quaking
people
of
earth
we
are
strangers
from
another
star
we
throw
ourselves
on
your
mercy
and
ask
for
your
generosity
our
problem
is
summed
up
in
the
genetic
law
equals
e
to
the
minus
of
one
of
the
men
was
laughing
ross
broke
off
the
man
smiled
wha
s
that
again
they
understood
he
repeated
the
formula
slowly
and
would
have
explained
further
but
the
man
cut
him
off
math
the
man
smiled
we
don
use
that
stuff
no
more
i
got
a
lab
assistant
maybe
he
uses
it
they
were
beyond
mathematics
they
had
broken
through
into
some
mode
of
symbolic
reasoning
that
must
be
as
far
beyond
mathematics
as
math
was
beyond
primitive
languages
sir
he
said
eagerly
you
must
be
a
scientist
may
i
ask
you
get
in
he
smiled
gigantic
doors
unfolded
from
the
vehicle
had
the
problem
been
snatched
from
his
brain
even
before
he
stated
it
mutely
he
gestured
at
helena
and
bernie
jones
would
be
all
right
where
he
was
for
several
hours
if
ross
was
any
judge
of
blackouts
and
you
don
t
quibble
with
demigods
the
man
the
scientist
did
something
to
a
glittering
control
panel
that
was
literally
more
complex
than
the
wesley
board
back
on
the
starship
noise
filled
the
that
ross
identified
as
music
for
a
moment
it
was
a
starkly
simple
music
whose
skeleton
was
three
thumps
and
a
crash
three
thumps
and
a
crash
then
followed
an
antiphonal
clear
tenor
demanding
in
a
monotone
is
this
your
car
and
a
tremendous
no
too
deep
for
him
ross
thought
forlornly
as
the
car
swerved
around
and
sped
off
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
control
board
and
fixed
on
the
largest
of
its
dials
where
a
needle
crawled
around
from
a
large
forty
to
a
large
fifty
and
a
red
sixty
proportional
to
the
velocity
of
the
vehicle
unable
to
concentrate
because
of
the
puzzling
music
unable
to
converse
he
wondered
what
the
units
of
time
and
space
were
that
gave
readings
of
fifty
and
sixty
for
their
very
low
rate
of
more
than
a
brisk
walk
when
you
noticed
the
slow
passage
of
objects
outside
but
there
seemed
to
be
a
whistle
of
wind
that
suggested
high
an
effect
peculiar
to
the
power
system
however
it
worked
he
tried
to
shout
a
question
at
the
driver
but
it
didn
t
get
through
the
driver
smiled
patted
his
arm
and
returned
to
his
driving
they
nosed
past
a
ross
almost
screamed
when
he
saw
what
was
on
the
other
side
a
curve
of
highway
jammed
solid
with
vehicles
that
were
traveling
at
blinding
speed
and
the
driver
wasn
t
stopping
ross
closed
his
eyes
and
jammed
his
feet
against
the
floorboards
waiting
for
the
crash
which
somehow
didn
t
come
when
he
opened
his
eyes
they
were
in
the
traffic
and
the
needle
on
the
speedometer
quivered
at
he
blew
a
great
breath
and
thought
admiringly
reflexes
to
match
their
superb
intellects
of
course
there
have
been
a
crash
just
then
across
the
safety
island
in
the
opposing
lane
there
was
a
crash
the
very
brief
flash
of
vision
ross
was
allowed
told
him
incredibly
that
a
vehicle
had
attempted
to
enter
the
lane
going
the
wrong
way
with
the
consequences
you
d
expect
he
watched
as
the
effects
of
the
crash
rippled
down
the
line
of
oncoming
traffic
the
squeal
of
brakes
and
rending
of
metal
was
audible
even
above
the
thumping
music
is
this
your
car
no
thereafter
as
they
drove
the
opposing
lane
was
motionless
but
not
silent
the
piercing
blasts
of
strings
and
trumpets
rose
to
the
heavens
from
each
vehicle
as
did
the
brilliant
pyrotechnic
jets
a
call
for
help
ross
theorized
the
music
was
beginning
to
make
his
head
ache
it
had
been
going
on
for
at
least
ten
minutes
suddenly
blessedly
it
changed
there
was
a
great
fanfare
of
trombones
in
major
thirds
that
seemed
to
go
on
forever
but
didn
t
quite
at
the
end
of
forever
the
same
tenor
chanted
you
got
a
roadmeister
and
the
chorus
roared
ross
realized
forlornly
that
the
music
must
contain
values
and
subtleties
which
his
coarser
senses
and
undeveloped
esthetic
background
could
not
grasp
but
he
wished
it
would
stop
it
was
making
him
miss
all
the
scenery
after
perhaps
the
fifteenth
repetition
of
the
roadmeister
motif
it
ended
the
driver
with
a
look
of
deep
satisfaction
did
something
to
the
control
board
that
turned
off
a
subsequent
voice
before
it
could
get
out
more
than
a
syllable
he
turned
to
ross
and
yelled
above
the
rush
of
air
and
gave
a
whimsical
shrug
during
the
moment
his
attention
wandered
from
the
road
his
vehicle
rammed
the
one
ahead
decelerated
sharply
and
was
rammed
by
the
one
behind
accelerated
and
rammed
the
one
ahead
again
and
then
fell
back
into
place
ross
suddenly
realized
that
he
knew
what
had
caused
those
crumples
and
crinkles
around
the
periphery
of
the
car
subtle
the
driver
yelled
indirection
sneak
it
what
ross
screamed
the
commersh
the
driver
yelled
it
meant
nothing
to
ross
and
he
felt
miserable
because
it
meant
nothing
he
studied
the
roadside
unhappily
and
almost
beamed
when
he
saw
a
sign
coming
up
not
advertising
of
course
he
thought
perhaps
some
austere
reminder
of
a
whole
man
s
duty
to
the
race
and
himself
some
noble
phrase
that
summed
up
the
wisdom
of
a
great
thinker
but
the
it
had
cooling
be
smug
smoke
smogs
and
the
next
one
urged
beat
your
sister
cheat
your
brother
but
send
some
smogs
to
dear
old
mother
it
said
it
on
four
signs
which
apparently
alerted
by
radar
zinged
in
succession
along
a
roadside
track
even
with
the
vehicle
there
were
more
and
worse
they
were
coming
to
a
city
turmoil
and
magnificence
white
pylons
natty
belts
of
green
lacy
bridges
the
roaring
traffic
pedestrians
waving
at
the
cars
and
it
sounded
like
suvvabih
suvvabih
the
shops
were
packed
and
radiant
dazzling
ross
wondered
fleetingly
how
one
parked
here
and
then
found
out
a
car
pulled
from
the
curb
and
a
hundred
cars
converged
on
the
spot
shrilling
their
sweet
message
and
spouting
their
gay
sparkles
theirs
too
there
were
a
pair
of
jolting
crashes
as
it
shouldered
two
other
vehicles
aside
and
parked
two
wheels
over
the
curb
and
on
the
sidewalk
shouted
drivers
and
the
man
beside
ross
gaily
repeated
the
cry
the
vehicle
s
doors
opened
and
they
climbed
out
into
the
quick
tempo
of
the
street
it
was
loud
with
a
melodious
babble
from
speaker
horns
visible
everywhere
the
driver
yelled
cheerfully
at
ross
c
mon
he
followed
dazed
and
baffled
assailed
by
sudden
doubts
and
contradictions
it
was
a
party
all
floors
up
a
shimmering
building
in
a
large
handsome
room
whose
principal
decorative
motif
seemed
to
be
cooling
fins
perhaps
twenty
couples
were
assembled
they
turned
and
applauded
as
they
made
their
appearance
the
vehicle
driver
standing
grandly
at
the
head
of
a
short
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
the
room
proclaimed
i
got

rocket
flyers

on
the
piece
of
paper

up
and
beamed

joe
turned
and
said
to
one
of
the
lovely
ladies
elna
show
him
the
she
unwrapped
a
swordfish
and
proudly
held
it
up
while
ross
bernie
and
helena
stared
wildly
the
profile
took
the
fish
and
poked
it
real
enough
joe

rocket

he
was

addressed
he
croaked
men
of

a
star

just
a
minute

earth

of
you

ross
said
he
furtively
pinched
himself
it
hurt
therefore
he
must
be
awake
or
crazy
the
profile
was
sorrowfully
addressing
a
downcast
joe
you
should
of
asked
them
joe
you
really
should
of
now
you
don
t
even
get
the
three
points
for

swordfish
because

an
tried

the
combo

reely
is
a
pity
din
t
you
ask
them
at
all
joe
blustered
he
did
say
sump
m
but
i
figured
a
rocket
flyer
was
a
rocket
flyer
and
they
come
out
of
a
his
lower
lip
was
trembling
both
of
the
ladies
of
his
party
were
crying
openly
we
tried
joe
said
and
began
to
blubber
ross
moved
away
from
him
in
horrified
disgust
the
profile
shook
its
head
turned
and
announced
owing
to
a
unfortunate
mistake
the
search
group
of
joseph
mulcahy
got
disqualified
for
the
combination
they
on
y
got
three
points
so
that
s
all
the
groups
in
an
who

the
highest
i
got
fifteen
i

fifteen
screamed
a
gorgeous
brunette
in
a
transport
of
joy
a
manhole
cover
from
the
museum
an
a
las
month
an
a
steering
wheel
from
a
police
car
i
got
fifteen
the
others
clustered
about
her
chattering
ross
said
to
the
profile
mechanically
man
of
earth
we
come
from
a
star
in
search
sure
buster
said
the
profile
sure
too
bad
but
you
should
of
told
joe
you
don
t
have
to
go
you
an
your
friends
have
a
drink
mix
have
fun
i
got
ta
go
give
the
prize
he
hurried
off
a
passing
blonde
stacked
said
to
ross
baldy
wan
na
see
my
operation
he
began
to
shake
his
head
and
felt
helena
s
fingers
close
like
steel
on
his
arm
the
blonde
sniffed
and
passed
on
i
ll
operate
her
helena
said
and
then
ross
what
s
with
everybody
they
act
so
young
even
the
old
people
follow
me
he
said
and
began
to
circulate
through
the
party
trailing
bernie
and
a
frankly
terrified
helena
and
confronting
and
demanding
and
cajoling
nothing
worked
he
was
greeted
with
amused
tolerance
and
invited
to
have
a
drink
and
asked
what
he
thought
of
the
latest
commersh
with
its
tepid
trumpets
nobody
gave
a
damn
that
he
was
from
a
star
except
joe
who
sullenly
watched
them
wander
and
finally
swaggered
up
to
ross
i
figured
something
out
he
said
grimly
you
made
me
he
brought
up
a
roundhouse
right
and
ross
saw
the
stars
and
heard
the
birdies
bernie
and
helena
brought
him
to
on
the
street
he
found
he
had
been
walking
for
some
five
minutes
with
a
mind
they
told
him
he
had
been
saying
over
and
over
again
men
of
earth
i
come
from
a
it
had
got
them
ejected
from
the
party
helena
was
crying
with
anger
and
frustration
she
had
also
got
a
nasty
scare
when
one
of
the
vehicles
had
swerved
up
onto
the
sidewalk
and
almost
crushed
the
three
of
them
against
the
building
wall
and
she
wailed
i
m
hungry
and
we
don
t
know
where
the
ship
is
and
i
ve
got
to
sit
down
go
so
do
i
bernie
said
weakly
so
did
ross
he
said
let
s
just
go
into
this
restaurant
i
know
we
have
no
t
nag
me
please
helena
we
ll
order
eat
not
pay
and
get
he
held
up
his
hand
at
the
protests
i
said
get
arrested
the
smartest
thing
we
could
do
obviously
somebody
s
running
this
it
s
not
the
stoops
we
ve
seen
the
quickest
way
i
know
of
to
get
to
whoever
s
in
charge
is
to
get
in
trouble
and
once
they
see
us
we
can
explain
it
made
sense
to
them
unfortunately
the
first
restaurant
they
tried
was
the
front
door
on
so
were
the
second
to
seventh
ross
tried
to
talk
bernie
into
slugging
a
pedestrian
so
they
could
all
be
jugged
for
disturbing
the
peace
but
failed
helena
noted
at
last
that
the
women
s
wear
shops
had
live
attendants
who
presumably
would
object
to
trouble
they
marched
into
one
of
the
gaudy
places
each
took
a
dress
from
a
rack
and
methodically
tore
them
to
pieces
a
saleslady
approached
them
dithering
and
asked
tremulously
what
for
did
you
do
that
din
t
you
like
the
dresses
well
yes
very
much
helena
began
apologetically
but
you
see
the
fact
shuddup
ross
told
her
he
said
to
the
saleslady
no
we
hated
them
we
hate
every
dress
here
we
re
going
to
tear
up
every
dress
in
the
place
why
don
t
you
call
the
police
oh
she
said
vaguely
all
right
and
vanished
into
the
rear
of
the
store
she
returned
after
a
minute
and
said
he
wants
to
know
your
just
say
three
desperate
strangers
ross
told
her
oh
thank
she
vanished
again
the
police
arrived
in
five
minutes
or
so
an
excited
elder
man
with
many
stripes
on
his
arms
strode
up
to
them
excitedly
as
they
stood
among
the
shredded
ruins
of
the
dresses
where
d
they
go
he
demanded
didja
see
what
they
looked
like
we
re
them
we
three
we
tore
these
dresses
up
you
d
better
take
them
along
for
oh
the
cop
said
okay
go
on
into
the
wagon
and
no
funny
business
hear
me
they
offered
no
funny
business
in
the
wagon
ross
expounded
on
his
theme
that
there
must
be
directing
intelligences
and
that
they
must
be
at
the
top
helena
was
horribly
depressed
because
she
had
never
been
arrested
before
and
bernie
was
almost
jaunty
something
about
him
suggested
that
he
felt
at
home
in
a
patrol
wagon
it
stopped
and
the
elderly
opened
the
door
for
them
ross
looked
on
the
busy
street
for
anything
resembling
a
station
house
and
found
none
the
cop
said
okay
you
people
get
going
an
let
s
don
t
have
no
trouble
or
i
ll
run
you
ross
yelled
in
outrage
this
is
a
you
have
no
right
to
turn
us
loose
we
demand
to
be
arrested
and
tried
wise
guy
sneered
the
cop
climbed
into
the
wagon
and
drove
off
they
stood
forlornly
as
the
crowd
eddied
and
swirled
around
them
there
was
a
plate
of
sandwiches
at
that
party
helena
recalled
wistfully
and
a
ladies
she
began
to
cry
if
only
you
hadn
t
acted
so
darn
superior
ross
i
ll
bet
they
would
have
let
us
have
all
the
sandwiches
we
bernie
said
unexpectedly
she
s
right
watch
he
buttonholed
a
pedestrian
and
said
yeah
asked
the
pedestrian
with
kindly
interest
bernie
concentrated
and
said
duh
i
yam
losted
i
yam
broke
i
losted
all
my
money
gim
me
some
money
mister
please
the
pedestrian
beamed
and
said
that
is
real
tough
luck
buddy
if
i
give
you
some
money
will
you
send
it
to
me
when
you
get
some
more
here
is
my
name
wrote
on
a
bernie
said
sure
mister
i
will
send
the
money
to
then
said
the
pedestrian
i
will
give
you
some
money
because
you
will
send
it
back
to
me
good
luck
bernie
with
quiet
pride
showed
them
a
piece
of
paper
that
bore
the
interesting
legend
twenty
dollars
let
s
eat
ross
said
awed
a
machine
on
a
restaurant
door
changed
the
bill
for
a
surprising
heap
of
coins
and
they
swaggered
in
making
beelines
for
the
modest
twin
doors
at
the
rear
of
the
place
close
up
the
doors
were
not
very
modest
but
after
the
initial
shock
ross
realized
that
there
must
be
many
on
this
planet
who
could
not
read
at
all
the
washroom
attendant
for
instance
who
collected
the
dimes
and
unlocked
the
booths
dime
seemed
to
be
his
total
vocabulary
by
comparison
the
machines
in
the
restaurant
proper
were
intelligent
the
three
of
them
ate
and
ate
and
ate
only
after
coffee
did
they
spare
a
thought
for
sam
jones
who
should
about
then
be
awakening
with
a
murderous
hangover
aboard
the
starship
thinking
about
him
did
not
mean
they
could
think
of
anything
to
do
he
s
in
trouble
bernie
said
in
trouble
first
things
what
trouble
asked
helena
brightly
you
got
twenty
dollars
by
asking
for
it
and
i
suppose
you
can
get
plenty
more
and
i
think
we
wouldn
t
have
got
thrown
out
of
that
party
hadn
t
gone
swaggering
around
talking
as
if
we
knew
everything
maybe
these
people
here
aren
t
very
ross
snorted
helena
went
on
doggedly
bright
but
they
certainly
can
tell
when
somebody
s
brighter
than
they
are
and
naturally
they
don
t
like
it
would
you
like
it
it
s
like
a
really
old
person
talking
to
a
really
young
person
about
nothing
but
age
but
here
when
you
re
bright
you
make
everybody
feel
bad
every
time
you
open
your
so
ross
said
impatiently
we
can
go
on
begging
and
drifting
but
that
s
not
what
we
re
here
for
the
answer
is
supposed
to
be
on
earth
obviously
none
of
the
people
we
ve
seen
could
possibly
know
anything
about
genetics
obviously
they
can
t
keep
this
machine
civilization
going
without
guidance
there
must
be
people
of
normal
intelligence
around
in
the
government
is
my
no
said
helena
but
she
wouldn
t
say
why
she
just
thought
not
the
inconclusive
debate
ended
with
them
on
the
street
again
bernie
who
seemed
to
enjoy
it
begged
a
hundred
dollars
ross
who
didn
t
got
eleven
dollars
in
singles
and
a
few
threats
of
violence
for
acting
like
a
wise
guy
helena
got
no
money
and
three
indecent
proposals
before
ross
indignantly
took
her
out
of
circulation
they
found
a
completely
automatic
hotel
at
nightfall
ross
tried
to
inspect
helena
s
room
for
comfort
and
safety
but
was
turned
back
at
the
threshold
by
a
staggering
jolt
of
electricity
mechanical
house
dick
he
muttered
picking
himself
up
from
the
floor
well
he
said
to
her
sourly
it
s
safe
good
and
later
in
the
gents
room
to
bernie
you
d
think
the
machine
could
be
adjusted
so
that
a
person
with
perfectly
innocent
intentions
could
visit
a
sure
said
bernie
soothingly
sure
say
ross
frankly
is
this
earth
exactly
what
you
expected
it
to
be
the
attendant
moved
creakily
across
the
floor
and
said
hopefully
dime
their
second
day
on
the
bum
they
accumulated
a
great
deal
of
change
and
crowded
into
a
telephone
booth
the
plan
was
to
try
to
locate
their
starship
and
find
out
what
if
anything
could
be
done
for
sam
jones
an
automatic
central
conferred
with
an
automatic
information
and
decided
that
they
wanted
the
captain
of
the
port
baltimore
rocket
field
they
got
the
port
captain
on
the
wire
and
ross
asked
after
the
starship
the
captain
asked
who
wan
sta
know
huh
ross
realized
he
had
overdone
it
and
shoved
bernie
at
the
phone
bernie
snorted
and
guggled
and
finally
got
out
that
he
jus
wannit
ta
know
the
captain
warmed
up
immediately
and
said
oh
sure
the
ship
it
was
still
there
all
right
how
about
the
fella
that
s
in
it
you
mean
the
fella
he
went
he
went
someplace
what
place
someplace
he
went
away
like
i
din
t
see
him
go
mister
i
got
plenty
to
do
without
i
should
watch
out
for
every
dummy
that
comes
t
anks
said
bernie
hopelessly
at
ross
s
signal
they
walked
the
street
deep
in
thought
helena
sobbed
let
s
him
here
ross
i
don
t
like
this
bernie
growled
what
s
the
difference
ross
he
can
get
a
snootful
just
as
easy
here
as
anywhere
no
it
isn
t
the
doc
don
t
you
see
but
this
is
the
place
we
re
looking
for
all
the
answers
we
need
are
here
we
ve
got
to
get
bernie
stepped
around
two
tussling
men
on
the
ground
ineffectually
thumping
each
other
over
a
confection
yeah
he
said
shortly
helena
said
isn
t
that
a
silly
way
to
put
up
a
big
sign
like
that
ross
looked
up
my
god
he
said
a
gigantic
metal
sign
with
the
legend
can
smoke
was
being
hoisted
across
the
street
ahead
the
street
was
nominally
closed
to
traffic
by
cheerfully
inattentive
men
with
red
flags
a
mobile
boom
hoist
was
doing
the
work
and
quite
obviously
doing
it
wrong
the
angle
of
the
boom
arm
with
the
vertical
was
far
too
great
for
stability
the
sign
was
tipping
the
body
of
the
hoisting
engine
on
its
treads
ross
made
a
flash
calculation
when
the
sign
fell
as
fall
it
inevitably
would
perhaps
two
hundred
people
who
had
wandered
uncaringly
past
the
warning
flags
would
be
under
it
there
was
a
sudden
aura
of
blue
light
around
the
engine
body
it
tipped
back
to
stability
the
boom
angle
decreased
and
the
engine
crawled
forward
to
take
up
the
horizontal
difference
the
blue
light
went
out
helena
choked
and
coughed
and
babbled
but
ross
it
have
ross
said
it
s
them
who
excitedly
the
people
behind
all
this
the
people
who
built
the
cities
and
put
up
the
buildings
and
designed
the
machines
the
people
who
have
the
answers
come
on
bernie
i
just
seem
to
antagonize
these
want
you
to
ask
the
boom
operator
what
the
boom
operator
cheerfully
explained
that
nah
it
was
just
somep
n
that
happened
nah
nobody
did
nothin
to
make
it
happen
it
was
in
case
if
anything
went
wrong
like
you
know
they
retired
and
regrouped
their
forces
foolproof
machines
ross
said
slowly
and
i
mean
really
proof
friends
i
was
wrong
i
admit
it
i
thought
that
those
buildings
and
cars
were
something
and
they
turned
out
to
be
just
silly
gimcracks
but
not
this
blue
light
thing
that
boom
to
bernie
shrugged
rebelliously
so
what
so
they
ve
got
some
kinds
of
machines
you
don
t
have
on
halsey
s
planet
a
different
order
of
machines
bernie
believe
me
that
blue
light
was
something
as
far
from
any
safety
device
i
ever
heard
of
as
the
starships
are
from
oxcarts
when
we
find
the
people
who
designed
suppose
they
re
all
dead
ross
winced
he
said
determinedly
we
ll
find
they
returned
to
their
begging
and
were
recognized
one
day
by
the
profile
of
the
party
he
didn
t
remember
just
who
they
were
or
where
they
were
from
or
where
he
had
met
them
but
he
enthusiastically
invited
them
to
yet
another
party
he
told
them
he
was
hennery
matson
owner
of
an
airline
ross
asked
about
accidents
and
blue
lights
matson
jovially
said
some
o
his
pilots
talked
about
them
things
but
he
din
t
bother
his
head
none
ya
get
these
planes
from
the
field
see
an
they
got
all
kinds
of
gadgets
on
them
come
on
to
the
party
they
went
because
hennery
promised
them
another
eisner
who
was
a
wealthy
aircraft
manufacturer
but
he
din
t
bother
his
head
none
either
them
rockets
was
hard
to
make
you
had
to
feed
the
patterns
like
into
the
master
jigs
just
so
and
boy
if
you
got
em
in
backwards
it
was
a
wheredja
get
the
patterns
look
mister
we
had
the
patterns
an
don
t
spoil
the
party
will
ya
the
party
was
a
smasher
they
all
woke
with
headaches
on
matson
s
deep
living
room
rug
you
did
fine
ross
helena
softly
assured
him
nobody
would
have
guessed
you
were
any
smarter
than
anybody
else
here
there
wasn
t
a
bit
of
ross
seemed
to
have
a
hiatus
in
his
memory
the
importance
of
the
hiatus
faded
as
time
passed
there
was
a
general
move
toward
the
automatic
dispensing
bar
it
seemed
to
be
regulated
by
a
time
clock
no
matter
what
you
dialed
first
thing
in
the
morning
it
ruthlessly
poured
a
double
rye
with
worcestershire
and
tabasco
and
plopped
a
fair
imitation
of
a
raw
egg
into
the
concoction
it
helped
along
about
noon
something
clicked
in
the
bar
s
innards
guests
long
since
surfeited
with
the
prairie
oysters
joyously
dialed
martinis
and
manhattans
and
the
day
s
serious
drinking
began
ross
fuzzily
tried
to
trace
the
bar
s
supply
there
were
nickel
pipes
that
led
heaven
knew
where
some
vast
depot
of
fermentation
tanks
and
stills
fed
grain
and
cane
by
crawling
grain
and
cane
planted
from
seed
the
carefully
culled
from
the
crop
for
the
monsters
his
head
was
beginning
to
ache
again
a
jovial
who
had
something
to
do
with
a
hey
fellas
i
got
a
idea
what
we
can
do
less
go
on
over
to
place
so
they
all
went
and
that
disposed
of
another
day
it
blended
into
a
dream
of
irresponsible
childhood
when
your
clothes
grew
shabby
you
helped
yourself
to
something
that
fit
from
your
host
of
the
moment
s
wardrobe
when
you
grew
tired
of
one
host
you
switched
to
another
they
seldom
remembered
you
from
day
to
day
and
they
never
asked
questions
their
sex
was
uninhibited
and
most
of
the
women
were
more
or
less
pregnant
most
of
the
time
they
fought
and
sulked
and
made
up
and
giggled
and
drank
and
ate
and
slept
all
of
the
men
had
jobs
and
all
of
them
once
in
a
while
would
remember
and
stagger
over
to
a
phone
and
make
a
call
to
an
automatic
receptionist
to
find
out
if
everything
was
going
all
right
with
their
jobs
it
always
was
they
loved
their
children
and
tolerated
anything
from
them
except
shrewd
inquisitiveness
which
drew
a
fast
bust
in
the
teeth
from
the
most
indulgent
daddy
or
adoring
mommy
they
loved
their
friends
and
their
guests
as
long
as
they
weren
t
wise
guys
and
tolerated
anything
from
long
as
they
weren
t
wise
guys
did
it
last
a
day
a
week
a
month
ross
didn
t
know
the
only
things
that
were
really
bothering
ross
were
first
nobody
wouldn
t
tell
him
nothin
about
the
blue
lights
and
second
that
bernie
he
was
actin
like
a
wise
guy
there
came
a
morning
when
it
ended
as
it
had
begun
on
somebody
s
living
room
rug
with
a
headache
pounding
between
his
eyes
helena
was
sobbing
softly
and
that
wise
guy
bernie
was
tugging
at
him
lea
me
alone
ordered
captain
ross
without
opening
his
eyes
wouldn
t
let
a
man
get
his
rest
what
did
he
have
to
bring
them
along
for
anyway
should
have
left
them
where
he
found
them
not
brought
them
to
this
place
earth
where
they
could
act
like
a
couple
of
wise
guys
and
keep
getting
in
his
way
every
time
he
came
close
to
the
people
the
intelligent
people
the
people
with
the
answers
he
lay
there
trying
to
remember
what
the
question
was
to
get
him
out
of
here
said
helena
s
voice
with
a
touch
of
hysteria
back
and
get
that
fellow
haarland
said
bernie
s
voice
equally
tense
ross
contemplated
the
fragments
of
conversation
he
had
caught
ignoring
what
the
two
were
saying
to
him
haarland
he
thought
fuzzily
wise
guy
bernie
had
him
on
his
feet
leggo
ordered
ross
but
bernie
was
tenacious
he
stumbled
along
and
found
himself
in
the
men
s
room
of
the
apartment
the
attendant
appeared
from
nowhere
and
bernie
said
something
to
him
the
attendant
rummaged
in
his
chest
and
found
something
that
bernie
put
into
a
fizzy
drink
ross
sniffed
at
it
suspiciously
wassit
he
asked
please
ross
drink
it
it
ll
sober
you
up
we
ve
got
to
get
out
of
re
going
nuts
helena
and
me
this
has
been
going
on
for
weeks
nope
got
ta
find
a
blue
light
ross
said
obstinately
swaying
but
you
aren
t
finding
it
ross
you
aren
t
doing
anything
except
get
drunk
and
pass
out
and
wake
up
and
get
drunk
come
on
drink
the
ross
impatiently
dashed
it
to
the
floor
bernie
sighed
all
right
ross
he
said
wearily
helena
can
run
the
ship
we
re
taking
go
ross
we
re
going
back
to
halsey
s
planet
where
you
came
from
maybe
haarland
can
tell
us
what
to
go
head
wise
guy
ross
sneered
the
attendant
was
watching
dubiously
as
bernie
slammed
out
and
ross
peered
at
himself
in
a
mirror
dime
the
attendant
asked
in
his
tired
voice
ross
gave
him
one
and
went
back
to
the
party
somehow
it
was
not
much
fun
he
shuffled
back
to
the
bar
the
boilermaker
didn
t
taste
too
good
he
set
it
down
and
glowered
around
the
room
the
party
was
back
in
swing
already
helena
and
bernie
were
nowhere
in
sight
let
them
go
then
he
drank
but
only
when
he
reminded
himself
to
this
party
had
become
a
costume
ball
one
of
the
men
lurched
out
of
the
room
and
staggered
back
guffawing
looka
him
one
of
the
women
shrieked
he
got
a
woman
s
hat
on
horace
you
get
the
craziest
kinda
ideas
ross
glowered
he
suddenly
realized
that
while
he
wasn
t
exactly
sober
he
wasn
t
drunk
either
those
soreheads
they
had
to
go
and
spoil
the
party
he
began
abruptly
to
get
less
drunk
yet
back
to
halsey
s
planet
they
said
ask
haarland
what
to
do
they
said
leave
him
he
was
cold
sober
he
found
a
telephone
the
automatic
central
checked
the
automatic
information
and
got
him
the
captain
of
the
port
baltimore
rocket
field
the
captain
was
helpful
and
sympathetic
caught
by
the
tense
note
in
ross
s
voice
when
he
told
him
who
wannit
to
know
the
captain
said
gee
buddy
if
i
d
of
known
i
woulda
stopped
them
stoled
your
ship
is
that
what
they
done
they
could
get
arrested
for
that
you
could
call
the
cops
an
maybe
they
could
do
ross
didn
t
bother
to
explain
he
hung
up
the
party
was
no
fun
at
all
he
left
it
ross
walked
along
the
street
hating
himself
he
couldn
t
hate
helena
and
bernie
they
had
done
the
right
thing
it
had
been
his
fault
all
the
way
down
the
line
he
d
been
acting
like
a
silly
child
he
d
had
a
job
of
work
to
do
and
he
let
himself
be
sidetracked
by
a
crazy
round
of
drinking
and
parties
of
course
he
told
himself
something
had
been
accomplished
somebody
had
built
the
the
happy
morons
he
had
been
playing
with
somebody
had
invented
whatever
it
was
that
flared
with
blue
light
and
repaired
the
idiot
errors
the
morons
made
somebody
somewhere
where
well
he
had
some
information
all
negative
at
the
parties
had
been
soldiers
and
politicians
and
industrialists
and
clergy
and
entertainers
and
heaven
save
the
mark
scientists
and
none
of
them
had
had
the
wit
to
do
more
than
push
the
number
three
button
when
the
green
light
a
blinked
by
rote
none
of
them
could
have
given
him
the
answer
to
the
question
that
threatened
to
end
human
domination
over
the
cosmos
none
of
them
would
have
known
what
the
words
meant
made
himself
face
there
was
no
answer
maybe
even
if
he
found
the
intellects
that
lurked
beneath
the
surface
on
this
ancient
planet
they
could
not
or
would
not
tell
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
maybe
the
intellects
didn
t
exist
maybe
he
was
all
wrong
in
all
of
his
assumptions
maybe
he
was
wasting
his
time
but
he
told
himself
wryly
he
had
fixed
it
for
himself
that
time
was
all
he
had
left
he
might
as
well
waste
it
he
might
as
well
go
right
on
looking
a
migrant
party
was
staggering
down
the
street
toward
him
a
score
of
persons
going
from
one
host
s
home
to
another
he
crossed
to
avoid
them
they
were
singing
drunkenly
ross
looked
at
them
with
the
distaste
of
the
recently
reformed
one
of
the
voices
raised
in
song
caught
his
ear
his
nose
and
dyed
it
rose
and
kissed
his
lady
fair
and
sat
her
down
on
a
cushion
brown
in
a
chair
by
jones
he
said
my
shoes
are
red
and
so
s
my
overcoat
and
with
buttons
nine
in
a
zigzag
line
i
doc
ross
bellowed
doc
jones
for
god
s
sake
come
over
here
they
got
rid
of
the
rest
of
doctor
sam
jones
s
party
and
ross
sobered
the
doctor
up
in
an
restaurant
it
wasn
t
hard
the
doctor
had
had
plenty
of
practice
ross
filled
him
in
carefully
explaining
why
bernie
and
helena
had
left
him
doc
jones
filled
ross
in
he
didn
t
have
much
to
tell
he
had
come
to
in
the
ship
waited
around
until
he
got
hungry
fallen
into
a
conversation
with
a
rocket
pilot
on
the
that
was
how
round
of
parties
had
begun
like
ross
doc
in
his
soberer
moments
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
earth
was
run
by
person
or
persons
unseen
he
had
learned
little
that
ross
hadn
t
found
out
or
deduced
the
blue
lights
had
bothered
him
too
he
d
asked
the
pilot
about
it
and
found
out
about
what
ross
appeared
to
be
some
sort
of
safety
device
which
kept
the
inevitable
accidents
from
becoming
unduly
fatal
how
they
worked
he
didn
t
but
he
had
an
idea
it
sounds
a
little
ridiculous
i
admit
he
said
embarrassed
but
i
think
it
might
work
it
s
a
radio
a
radio
program
i
said
it
sounded
ridiculous
they
call
it
what
s
biting
you
and
one
of
the
fellows
was
telling
me
about
it
it
seems
that
you
can
appear
before
the
panel
on
the
program
with
any
sort
of
problem
any
sort
at
all
and
they
guarantee
to
solve
it
for
you
there
s
some
sort
of
bond
don
t
know
much
about
the
details
but
this
man
assured
me
that
the
bond
was
only
a
formality
they
never
failed
of
course
doc
finished
hearing
his
own
proposal
with
a
touch
of
doubt
i
don
t
know
whether
they
ever
had
any
problem
like
this
before
yeah
said
ross
what
have
we
got
to
lose
they
got
into
the
program
it
took
the
techniques
of
a
doubler
on
an
army
chow
line
and
a
fair
amount
of
brute
strength
but
they
got
to
the
head
of
the
queue
at
the
studio
and
wedged
themselves
inside
doc
came
close
to
throttling
the
man
who
prowled
through
the
studio
audience
selecting
the
lucky
few
who
would
get
on
they
got
on
the
theme
music
swelled
majestically
around
them
and
a
chorus
crooned
what
s
biting
it
was
repeated
three
times
with
crashing
cymbals
under
the
hunh
ross
listened
to
the
beginning
of
the
program
and
cursed
himself
for
being
persuaded
into
such
a
harebrained
tactic
but
he
had
to
admit
the
program
offered
the
only
possibility
in
sight
the
central
figure
was
a
huge
jovially
grinning
figure
of
smoking
a
smog
and
billowing
smoke
rings
at
the
audience
an
announcer
for
some
obscure
reason
in
blackface
interviewed
the
disturbed
derelicts
who
came
before
smiley
smog
the
figure
and
propounded
their
problems
to
smiley
in
a
sort
of
doggerel
and
in
doggerel
the
answers
came
back
the
first
person
to
go
up
before
smiley
was
a
woman
clearly
in
her
last
month
of
pregnancy
the
announcer
introduced
her
to
the
audience
and
begged
for
a
real
loud
holler
of

the
huge

head
rotated
on
a
concealed
hinge
to
look
down
on
the
woman
from
a
deep
in
smiley
s
belly
a
weary
voice
declaimed

the
doctor
hissed

and

against

man

him

toward

hissed
venomously
blocking
off
the
other
man

he
said
belligerently
before
the
announcer
could
put
him
through
the
preliminaries
is
simply
this
equals
e
to
the
dead
silence
in
the
studio
the
announcer
quavered

ross
repeated
firmly

on
program
before
whaddya
some
kind
of
a
wise
guy
there
might
have
been
violence
the
conditions
were
right
for
it
but
uncle
smiley
smog
saved
the
day
the
figure
puffed
a
blinding
series
of
smoke
rings
at
ross
from
its
molded
torso
the
weary
voice

if
you
re
looking
for
counsel
sagacious
and
wise
the
price
is
ten
cents

right
under

left
the
studio
in
a
storm
of
animosity
maybe
we
could
have
collected
the
forfeit
doc
said
hopefully
maybe
we
could
have
collected
some
lumps
ross
growled
got
any
more
ideas
the
doctor
sipped
his
coffee
no
he
admitted
i
i
don
t
suppose
that
means
that
jingle
sure
it
means
something
doc
it
means
i
should
have
had
my
head
examined
for
letting
you
talk
me
into
that
the
doctor
said
rebelliously
maybe
i
m
wrong
ross
but
i
don
t
see
that
you
ve
had
any
ideas
than
panned
out
much
ross
got
up
all
right
he
admitted
i
m
sorry
if
i
gave
you
a
hard
time
it
s
all
this
coffee
and
all
the
liquor
underneath
it
i
swear
if
i
ever
get
back
to
a
civilized
planet
i
m
going
on
a
solid
diet
for
a
they
headed
for
the
room
marked
gents
ross
sullenly
quiet
doc
thoughtfully
quiet
doc
said
reflectively
the
price
is
ten
ross
could
that
mean
a
paper
that
we
could
buy
on
a
newsstand
maybe
yeah
ross
said
in
irritation
look
doc
don
t
give
it
another
thought
there
must
be
some
way
to
straighten
this
thing
out
i
ll
think
of
it
let
s
just
make
believe
that
whole
asinine
radio
program
never
the
attendant
materialized
and
offered
ross
a
towel
dime
he
said
wearily
ross
fished
absently
in
his
pocket
the
thing
that
bothers
me
doc
he
said
is
that
i
know
there
are
intelligent
people
somewhere
around
i
even
know
what
they
re
doing
i
bet
they
re
doing
exactly
what
i
tried
to
do
acted
as
stupid
as
anybody
else
or
stupider
i
d
make
a
guess
he
said
warming
up
that
if
we
could
just
make
a
statistical
analysis
of
the
whole
planet
and
find
the
absolute
people
of
the
lot
we
he
ran
out
of
breath
all
at
once
his
eyes
bulged
he
looked
at
the
men
attendant
and
at
the
piece
in
his
own
hand
you
he
breathed
the
attendant
s
face
suddenly
seemed
to
come
to
life
in
a
voice
that
was
abruptly
richer
and
deeper
than
before
the
man
said
yes
you
had
to
find
us
yourself
you
there
was
a
home
base
a
gigantic
island
called
australia
to
which
they
took
ross
and
doc
jones
in
a
little
car
that
sprouted
no
wings
and
flashed
no
rockets
but
flew
they
lived
underground
there
invisible
to
goggling
passengers
and
crewmen
aboard
the
they
weren
t
rockets
they
were
but
it
made
the
children
happy
to
think
that
they
had
rockets
so
iron
filings
were
added
to
the
hot
jet
stream
and
they
sparkled
in
magnificent
display
there
they
were
born
and
there
they
spent
strange
childhoods
learning
such
things
as
psychodynamics
and
teleportation
by
the
time
they
were
eight
months
or
so
old
they
thought
it
amusing
to
converse
of
self
and
the
meaning
of
meaning
by
eighteen
months
a
dozen
infants
would
chat
in
but
by
the
age
of
two
they
had
put
such
toys
behind
them
with
a
sigh
of
pleasant
regret
they
would
revert
to
them
only
for
such
purposes
as
or
choral
funeral
addresses
they
were
then
of
an
age
to
begin
their
work
they
were
born
there
and
trained
there
for
terrible
tasks
and
they
died
there
at
whatever
risk
for
that
they
would
not
surrender
their
right
to
die
among
their
own
but
their
lives
between
cradle
and
grave
those
they
gave
away
nursemaids
what
else
can
one
call
them
they
explained
it
patiently
to
ross
and
the
doctor
the
pattern
emerged
clearly
in
the
twentieth
century
swarming
slums
abrawl
with
children
children
children
everywhere
walk
down
a
chicago
southside
street
and
walk
away
with
the
dazed
impression
that
all
the
world
was
pregnant
walk
through
pretty
pleasant
evanston
and
find
the
impression
wrong
those
who
lived
in
evanston
were
reasonable
people
they
waited
and
thought
being
reasonable
they
saved
and
planned
being
reasonable
they
resorted
to
gadgets
or
chemicals
or
continence
a
woman
of
the
period
had
some
three
hundred
and
ninety
opportunities
to
conceive
a
child
in
the
slums
and
the
hills
they
took
advantage
of
as
many
of
them
as
they
might
but
around
the
universities
in
the
neighborhoods
of
the
and
the
what
was
the
score
first
education
until
the
age
of
twenty
this
left
two
hundred
and
opportunities
then
for
perhaps
five
years
shared
work
the
car
the
mortgage
the
furniture
that
two
salaries
would
pay
off
earlier
than
one
two
hundred
and
opportunities
were
left
some
of
them
were
seized
a
spate
of
childbearing
perhaps
would
come
next
but
subtract
a
good
ten
years
more
at
the
end
of
the
cycle
for
the
years
when
a
child
would
be
simply
too
late
for
fashion
too
late
for
companionship
with
the
we
started
with
three
hundred
and
ninety
opportunities
we
have
perhaps
one
hundred
and
left
is
that
the
roster
complete
no
there
is
the
battle
of
the
budget
no
not
right
now
not
until
the
summer
place
is
paid
for
and
more
the
visits
from
the
the
quarterly
tax
payments
the
liaisons
and
the
furtive
knives
behind
the
brownstone
fronts
and
what
becomes
of
have
all
been
charted
but
these
are
superfluous
the
ratio
points
out
the
inevitable
as
three
hundred
and
ninety
outweighs
one
hundred
and
so
the
genes
of
the
slovenly
and
heedless
outweigh
the
thoughtful
and
slow
to
act
we
tampered
with
the
inevitable
the
planet
teemed
and
burst
the
starships
went
forth
the
strong
bright
quick
ones
went
out
in
the
ships
two
sorts
were
left
the
strong
ones
who
were
not
bright
the
bright
ones
who
were
not
strong
we
are
the
prisoners
of
the
planet
we
can
not
leave
the
witless
ones
leave
but
who
would
have
them
ross
peered
into
the
shifting
shadows
but
he
said
you
are
the
masters
of
the
we
are
slaves
fully
alive
only
here
where
we
are
born
and
die
abstracted
and
as
witless
as
they
when
we
are
among
we
might
be
for
each
of
us
square
miles
to
stand
guard
over
our
minds
roving
across
the
traps
we
dare
not
ignore
ready
to
leap
out
and
straighten
these
children
s
toppling
walls
of
blocks
ready
to
warn
the
child
that
sharp
things
cut
and
hot
things
burn
the
blue
you
think
they
were
machines
they
were
you
re
torturing
yourselves
ross
exploded
let
them
we
are
not
such
ross
was
humbled
before
their
tragedy
diffidently
he
spoke
of
halsey
s
planet
ragansworld
azor
jones
he
warmed
to
the
task
and
was
growing
he
thought
eloquent
when
their
smiles
left
him
standing
ashamed
i
don
t
understand
he
said
almost
weeping
the
voice
corrected
him
you
do
but
you
do
that
you
do
consider
the
facts
your
planet
sterile
and
slowly
dying
the
planets
you
have
seen
one
sterile
because
it
is
imprisoned
by
ancients
one
sterile
under
an
matriarchal
custom
one
sterile
because
all
traces
of
divergence
have
been
wiped
out
earth
split
into
an
incurable
sterility
of
brainless
health
the
sterility
of
sick
intellect
humanity
then
imprisoned
in
a
thousand
sterile
tubes
cut
off
each
from
the
other
dying
we
feared
war
and
so
we
isolated
the
members
with
a
wall
of
time
we
have
found
something
worse
to
fear
what
if
the
walls
are
cracked
crack
the
walls
how
is
it
too
late
somehow
the
image
of
helena
was
before
him
is
it
too
late
they
gently
mocked
surely
you
know
how
perhaps
you
will
ask
the
image
of
helena
was
blushing
ross
s
heart
leaped
as
simple
as
that
for
you
yes
for
others
there
will
be
lives
spent
over
the
lathes
and
milling
machines
eyes
gone
blind
in
calculating
and
refining
trajectories
daring
ones
lost
screaming
in
the
hearts
of
stars
or
gibbering
with
hunger
and
pain
as
the
final
madness
closes
down
on
them
stranded
between
galaxies
there
will
be
martyrs
to
undergo
the
worst
martyrdom
of
is
to
say
they
will
never
know
of
it
they
will
be
unhappy
traders
and
grinding
their
lives
to
smooth
dull
blanks
against
the
wearying
routine
so
that
the
daring
ones
may
go
forth
to
the
stars
but
for
have
seen
the
answer
old
blood
runs
thin
thin
blood
runs
cold
cold
blood
dies
let
the
walls
there
was
a
murmuring
in
the
shadows
that
ross
could
not
hear
then
the
voice
again
saying
a
sort
of
we
have
had
a
great
deal
of
experience
with
children
so
we
know
that
they
must
not
be
told
too
much
there
is
nothing
more
you
need
be
told
you
will
go
back
ross
dared
interrupt
but
our
others
have
taken
it
again
the
soundless
laughter
the
ship
has
not
been
taken
far
did
you
think
we
would
leave
you
stranded
here
ross
peered
hard
into
the
shadows
but
only
the
shadows
were
there
and
then
he
and
jones
were
in
the
shadows
no
longer
ross
helena
was
hysterical
with
joy
even
bernie
was
stammering
and
shaking
his
head
incredulously
ross
dearest
we
the
ship
acted
all
and
then
it
landed
here
and
there
just
wasn
t
anybody
around
and
i
couldn
t
make
it
go
it
will
go
now
ross
promised
it
did
they
sealed
ship
he
took
the
controls
and
they
hung
in
space
looking
back
on
a
planet
with
a
single
moon
there
were
questions
but
ross
put
an
end
to
questions
he
said
we
re
going
back
to
halsey
s
planet
haarland
wanted
an
answer
we
ve
found
it
we
ll
bring
it
to
him
the
families
have
kept
their
secret
too
well
no
wars
between
the
stagnation
worse
than
wars
and
haarland
s
answer
is
this
he
will
be
the
first
of
the
traders
he
ll
build
ships
and
he
ll
carelessly
let
their
secrets
be
stolen
we
ll
bridge
the
galaxy
with
transports
and
we
ll
pack
the
ships
with
a
galaxy
of
crews
new
genes
for
old
hybrid
vigor
for
dreary
decay
do
you
see
it
his
voice
was
ringing
loud
helena
s
eyes
on
him
were
adoring
mate
jones
to
azor
halsey
s
planet
to
earth
smash
the
smooth
declining
curve
cross
the
strains
and
then
breed
them
back
let
mankind
become
genetically
wild
again
instead
of
rabbits
isolated
in
their
sterile
hutches
exultantly

set
up
the
