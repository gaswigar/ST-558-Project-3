without
your
consent
or
knowledge
i
have
ventured
to
dedicate
this
translation
to
you
as
the
countryman
of
chopin
and
filled
with
the
same
earnest
patriotism
which
distinguished
him
as
an
impassioned
and
perfect
pianist
capable
of
reproducing
his
difficult
compositions
in
all
the
subtle
tenderness
fire
energy
melancholy
despair
caprice
hope
delicacy
and
startling
vigor
which
they
imperiously
exact
as
thorough
master
of
the
complicated
instrument
to
which
he
devoted
his
best
powers
as
an
erudite
and
experienced
possessor
of
that
abstruse
and
difficult
science
music
as
a
composer
of
true
deep
and
highly
original
genius
this
dedication
is
justly
made
to
you
even
though
i
may
have
wounded
your
characteristically
haughty
shrinking
and
sclavic
susceptibilities
in
rendering
so
public
a
tribute
to
your
artistic
skill
forgive
me
the
high
moral
worth
and
manly
rectitude
which
distinguish
you
and
which
alone
render
even
the
most
sublime
genius
truly
illustrious
in
the
eyes
of
woman
almost
force
these
inadequate
and
imperfect
words
from
the
heart
of
the
translator
preface
to
a
people
always
prompt
in
its
recognition
of
genius
and
ready
to
sympathize
in
the
joys
and
woes
of
a
truly
great
artist
this
work
will
be
one
of
exceeding
interest
it
is
a
short
glowing
and
generous
sketch
from
the
hand
of
franz
liszt
who
considered
in
the
double
light
of
composer
and
performer
has
no
living
equal
of
the
original
and
romantic
chopin
the
most
ethereal
subtle
and
delicate
among
our
modern
it
is
a
rare
thing
for
a
great
artist
to
write
on
art
to
leave
the
passionate
worlds
of
sounds
or
colors
for
the
colder
realm
of
words
rarer
still
for
him
to
abdicate
even
temporarily
his
own
throne
to
stand
patiently
and
hold
aloft
the
blazing
torch
of
his
own
genius
to
illume
the
gloomy
grave
of
another
yet
this
has
liszt
done
through
love
for
chopin
it
is
a
matter
of
considerable
interest
to
note
how
the
nervous
and
agile
fingers
accustomed
to
sovereign
rule
over
the
keys
handle
the
pen
how
the
musician
feels
as
a
man
how
he
estimates
art
and
artists
liszt
is
a
man
of
extensive
culture
vivid
imagination
and
great
knowledge
of
the
world
and
in
addition
to
their
high
artistic
value
his
lines
glow
with
poetic
fervor
with
impassioned
eloquence
his
musical
criticisms
are
refined
and
acute
but
without
repulsive
technicalities
or
scientific
terms
ever
sparkling
with
the
poetic
ardor
of
the
generous
soul
through
which
the
discriminating
yet
appreciative
awards
were
poured
ah
in
these
days
of
degenerate
rivalries
and
bitter
jealousies
let
us
welcome
a
proof
of
affection
so
tender
as
his
life
of
chopin
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
reader
of
this
book
to
remain
ignorant
of
the
exactions
of
art
while
through
its
eloquence
and
subtle
analysis
of
character
it
appeals
to
the
cultivated
literary
tastes
of
our
people
it
opens
for
them
a
dazzling
perspective
into
that
strange
world
of
tones
of
whose
magical
realm
they
know
comparatively
speaking
so
little
it
is
intelligible
to
all
who
think
or
feel
requiring
no
knowledge
of
music
for
its
comprehension
the
compositions
of
chopin
are
now
the
mode
the
rage
every
one
asks
for
them
every
one
tries
to
play
them
we
have
however
but
few
remarks
upon
the
peculiarities
of
his
style
or
the
proper
manner
of
producing
his
works
his
compositions
generally
perfect
in
form
are
never
abstract
conceptions
but
had
their
birth
in
his
soul
sprang
from
the
events
of
his
life
and
are
full
of
individual
and
national
idiosyncrasies
of
psychological
interest
liszt
knew
chopin
both
as
man
and
artist
chopin
loved
to
hear
him
interpret
his
music
and
himself
taught
the
great
pianist
the
mysteries
of
his
undulating
rhythm
and
original
motifs
the
broad
and
noble
criticisms
contained
in
this
book
are
absolutely
essential
for
the
musical
culture
of
the
thousands
now
laboriously
but
vainly
struggling
to
perform
his
elaborate
works
and
who
having
no
key
to
their
multiplied
complexities
of
expression
frequently
fail
in
rendering
them
aright
and
the
masses
in
this
country
full
of
vivid
perception
and
intelligent
curiosity
who
not
playing
themselves
would
yet
fain
follow
with
the
heart
compositions
which
they
are
told
are
of
so
much
artistic
value
will
here
find
a
key
to
guide
them
through
the
tuneful
labyrinth
some
of
chopin
best
works
are
analyzed
herein
he
wrote
for
the
heart
of
his
people
their
joys
sorrows
and
caprices
are
immortalized
by
the
power
of
his
art
he
was
a
strictly
national
and
to
understand
him
fully
something
must
be
known
of
the
brave
and
haughty
but
unhappy
country
which
he
so
loved
liszt
felt
this
and
has
been
exceedingly
happy
in
the
short
sketch
given
of
poland
we
actually
know
more
of
its
picturesque
and
characteristic
customs
after
a
perusal
of
his
graphic
pages
than
after
a
long
course
of
dry
historical
details
his
remarks
on
the
polonaise
and
mazourka
are
full
of
the
philosophy
and
essence
of
history
these
dances
grew
directly
from
the
heart
of
the
polish
people
repeating
the
martial
valor
and
haughty
love
of
noble
exhibition
of
their
men
the
tenderness
devotion
and
subtle
coquetry
of
their
women
they
were
of
course
favorite
forms
with
chopin
their
national
character
made
them
dear
to
the
national
poet
the
remarks
of
liszt
on
these
dances
are
given
with
a
knowledge
so
acute
of
the
traits
of
the
nation
in
which
they
originated
with
such
a
gorgeousness
of
description
and
correctness
of
detail
that
they
rather
resemble
a
highly
finished
picture
than
a
colder
work
of
words
only
they
have
all
the
splendor
of
a
brilliant
painting
he
seizes
the
secrets
of
the
nationality
of
these
forms
traces
them
through
the
heart
of
the
polish
people
follows
them
through
their
marvelous
transfiguration
in
the
pages
of
the
polish
artist
and
reads
by
their
light
much
of
the
sensitive
and
exclusive
character
of
chopin
analyzing
it
with
the
skill
of
love
while
depicting
it
with
romantic
eloquence
to
those
who
can
produce
the
compositions
of
chopin
in
the
spirit
of
their
author
no
words
are
necessary
they
follow
with
the
heart
the
poetic
and
palpitating
emotions
so
exquisitely
wrought
through
the
aerial
tissue
of
the
tones
by
this
psychologist
this
bold
and
original
explorer
in
the
invisible
world
of
sound
all
honor
to
their
genius
oh
happy
and
of
many
millions
they
the
purest
chosen
whom
art
service
pure
hallows
and
claims
whose
hearts
are
made
her
throne
whose
lips
her
oracle
ordained
secure
to
lead
a
priestly
life
and
feed
the
ray
of
her
eternal
shrine
to
them
alone
her
glorious
countenance
unveiled
is
shown
ye
the
high
brotherhood
she
links

in
the
great
rank
allotted
by
her
choice

loftiest

occur
in

book
the
description
of
the
last
days
of
poor
chopin
melancholy
life
with
the
untiring
devotion
of
those
around
him
including
the
beautiful

delphine
potocka
his
cherished
sister
louise
his
devoted
friend
and
pupil
gutman
with
the
great
liszt
himself
is
full
of
tragic
interest
no
pains
have
been
spared
by
the
translator
to
make
the
translation
acceptable
for
the
task
was
truly
a
labor
of
love
no
motives
of
interest
induced
the
lingering
over
the
careful
rendering
of
the
charmed
pages
but
an
intense
desire
that
our
people
should
know
more
of
musical
art
that
while
acknowledging
the
generosity
and
eloquence
of
liszt
they
should
learn
to
appreciate
and
love
the
more
subtle
fire
the
more
creative
genius
of
the
unfortunate
but
honorable
and
honored
artist
chopin
perchance
liszt
may
yet
visit
us
we
may
yet
hear
the
matchless
pianist
call
from
their
graves
in
the
white
keys
the
delicate
arabesques
the
undulating
and
varied
melodies
of
chopin
we
should
be
prepared
to
appreciate
the
great
artist
in
his
enthusiastic
rendering
of
the
of
the
man
he
loved
prepared
to
greet
him
when
he
electrifies
us
with
his
wonderful
cyclopean
harmonies
written
for
his
own
herculean
grasp
sparkling
with
his
own
promethean
fire
which
no
meaner
hand
can
ever
hope
to
master
hear
liszt
and
die
has
been
said
by
some
of
his
enthusiastic
admirers
understand
him
and
live
were
the
wiser
advice
in
gratitude
then
to
chopin
for
the
multiplied
sources
of
high
and
pure
pleasure
which
he
has
revealed
to
humanity
in
his
creations
that
human
woe
and
sorrow
become
pure
beauty
when
his
magic
spell
is
on
them
the
translator
calls
upon
all
lovers
of
the
beautiful
to
contribute
a
stone
to
the
pyramid
now
rapidly
erecting
in
honor
of
the
great
modern
composer
ay
the
living
stone
of
appreciation
crystalized
in
the
enlightened
gratitude
of
the
heart
so
works
this
music
upon
earth
god
so
admits
it
sends
it
forth
to
add
another
worth
to
worth
a
new
that
rounds
the
old
creation
and
expounds
his

psychological
character
of

chopin
deeply
regretted
as
he
may
be
by
the
whole
body
of
artists
lamented
by
all
who
have
ever
known
him
we
must
still
be
permitted
to
doubt
if
the
time
has
even
yet
arrived
in
which
he
whose
loss
is
so
peculiarly
deplored
by
ourselves
can
be
appreciated
in
accordance
with
his
just
value
or
occupy
that
high
rank
which
in
all
probability
will
be
assigned
him
in
the
future
if
it
has
been
often
proved
that
no
one
is
a
prophet
in
his
own
country
is
it
not
equally
true
that
the
prophets
the
men
of
the
future
who
feel
its
life
in
advance
and
prefigure
it
in
their
works
are
never
recognized
as
prophets
in
their
own
times
it
would
be
presumptuous
to
assert
that
it
can
ever
be
otherwise
in
vain
may
the
young
generations
of
artists
protest
against
the
whose
invariable
custom
it
is
to
assault
and
beat
down
the
living
with
the
dead
time
alone
can
test
the
real
value
or
reveal
the
hidden
beauties
either
of
musical
compositions
or
of
kindred
efforts
in
the
sister
arts
as
the
manifold
forms
of
art
are
but
different
incantations
charged
with
electricity
from
the
soul
of
the
artist
and
destined
to
evoke
the
latent
emotions
and
passions
in
order
to
render
them
sensible
intelligible
and
in
some
degree
tangible
so
genius
may
be
manifested
in
the
invention
of
new
forms
adapted
it
may
be
to
the
expression
of
feelings
which
have
not
yet
surged
within
the
limits
of
common
experience
and
are
indeed
first
evoked
within
the
magic
circle
by
the
creative
power
of
artistic
intuition
in
arts
in
which
sensation
is
linked
to
emotion
without
the
intermediate
assistance
of
thought
and
reflection
the
mere
introduction
of
unaccustomed
forms
of
unused
modes
must
present
an
obstacle
to
the
immediate
comprehension
of
any
very
original
composition
the
surprise
nay
the
fatigue
caused
by
the
novelty
of
the
singular
impressions
which
it
awakens
will
make
it
appear
to
many
as
if
written
in
a
language
of
which
they
were
ignorant
and
which
that
reason
will
in
itself
be
sufficient
to
induce
them
to
pronounce
a
barbarous
dialect
the
trouble
of
accustoming
the
ear
to
it
will
repel
many
who
will
in
consequence
refuse
to
make
a
study
of
it
through
the
more
vivid
and
youthful
organizations
less
enthralled
by
the
chains
of
habit
through
the
more
ardent
spirits
won
first
by
curiosity
then
filled
with
passion
for
the
new
idiom
must
it
penetrate
and
win
the
resisting
and
opposing
public
which
will
finally
catch
the
meaning
the
aim
the
construction
and
at
last
render
justice
to
its
qualities
and
acknowledge
whatever
beauty
it
may
contain
musicians
who
do
not
restrict
themselves
within
the
limits
of
conventional
routine
have
consequently
more
need
than
other
artists
of
the
aid
of
time
they
can
not
hope
that
death
will
bring
that
instantaneous
to
their
works
which
it
gives
to
those
of
the
painters
no
musician
could
renew
to
the
profit
of
his
manuscripts
the
deception
practiced
by
one
of
the
great
flemish
painters
who
wishing
in
his
lifetime
to
benefit
by
his
future
glory
directed
his
wife
to
spread
abroad
the
news
of
his
death
in
order
that
the
pictures
with
which
he
had
taken
care
to
cover
the
walls
of
his
studio
might
suddenly
increase
in
value
whatever
may
be
the
present
popularity
of
any
part
of
the
productions
of
one
broken
by
suffering
long
before
taken
by
death
it
is
nevertheless
to
be
presumed
that
posterity
will
award
to
his
works
an
estimation
of
a
far
higher
character
of
a
much
more
earnest
nature
than
has
hitherto
been
awarded
them
a
high
rank
must
be
assigned
by
the
future
historians
of
music
to
one
who
distinguished
himself
in
art
by
a
genius
for
melody
so
rare
by
such
graceful
and
remarkable
enlargements
of
the
harmonic
tissue
and
his
triumph
will
be
justly
preferred
to
many
of
far
more
extended
surface
though
the
works
of
such
victors
may
be
played
and
replayed
by
the
greatest
number
of
instruments
and
be
sung
and
resung
by
passing
crowds
of
prime
donne
in
confining
himself
exclusively
to
the
piano
chopin
has
in
our
opinion
given
proof
of
one
of
the
most
essential
qualities
of
a
composer
a
just
appreciation
of
the
form
in
which
he
possessed
the
power
to
excel
yet
this
very
fact
to
which
we
attach
so
much
importance
has
been
injurious
to
the
extent
of
his
fame
it
would
have
been
most
difficult
for
any
other
writer
gifted
with
such
high
harmonic
and
melodic
powers
to
have
resisted
the
temptation
of
the
singing
of
the
bow
the
liquid
sweetness
of
the
flute
or
the
deafening
swells
of
the
trumpet
which
we
still
persist
in
believing
the
only
of
the
antique
goddess
from
whom
we
woo
the
sudden
favors
what
strong
conviction
based
upon
reflection
must
have
been
requisite
to
have
induced
him
to
restrict
himself
to
a
circle
apparently
so
much
more
barren
what
warmth
of
creative
genius
must
have
been
necessary
to
have
forced
from
its
apparent
aridity
a
fresh
growth
of
luxuriant
bloom
unhoped
for
in
such
a
soil
what
intuitive
penetration
is
repealed
by
this
exclusive
choice
which
wresting
the
different
effects
of
the
various
instruments
from
their
habitual
domain
where
the
whole
foam
of
sound
would
have
broken
at
their
feet
transported
them
into
a
sphere
more
limited
indeed
but
far
more
idealized
what
confident
perception
of
the
future
powers
of
his
instrument
must
have
presided
over
his
voluntary
renunciation
of
an
empiricism
so
widely
spread
that
another
would
have
thought
it
a
mistake
a
folly
to
have
wrested
such
great
thoughts
from
their
ordinary
interpreters
how
sincerely
should
we
revere
him
for
this
devotion
to
the
beautiful
for
its
own
sake
which
induced
him
not
to
yield
to
the
general
propensity
to
scatter
each
light
spray
of
melody
over
a
hundred
orchestral
desks
and
enabled
him
to
augment
the
resources
of
art
in
teaching
how
they
may
be
concentrated
in
a
more
limited
space
elaborated
at
less
expense
of
means
and
condensed
in
time
far
from
being
ambitious
of
the
uproar
of
an
orchestra
chopin
was
satisfied
to
see
his
thought
integrally
produced
upon
the
ivory
of
the
succeeding
in
his
aim
of
losing
nothing
in
power
without
pretending
to
orchestral
effects
or
to
the
brush
of
the
oh
we
have
not
yet
studied
with
sufficient
earnestness
and
attention
the
designs
of
his
delicate
pencil
habituated
as
we
are
in
these
days
to
consider
only
those
composers
worthy
of
a
great
name
who
have
written
at
least
operas
as
many
oratorios
and
various
symphonies
vainly
requiring
every
musician
to
do
every
thing
nay
a
little
more
than
every
thing
however
widely
diffused
this
idea
may
be
its
justice
is
to
say
the
least
highly
problematical
we
are
far
from
contesting
the
glory
more
difficult
of
attainment
or
the
real
superiority
of
the
epic
poets
who
display
their
splendid
creations
upon
so
large
a
plan
but
we
desire
that
material
proportion
in
music
should
be
estimated
by
the
same
measure
which
is
applied
to
dimension
in
other
branches
of
the
fine
arts
as
for
example
in
painting
where
a
canvas
of
twenty
inches
square
as
the
vision
of
ezekiel
or
le
cimetiere
by
ruysdael
is
placed
among
the
chefs
and
is
more
highly
valued
than
pictures
of
a
far
larger
size
even
though
they
might
be
from
the
hands
of
a
rubens
or
a
tintoret
in
literature
is
beranger
less
a
great
poet
because
he
has
condensed
his
thoughts
within
the
narrow
limits
of
his
songs
does
not
petrarch
owe
his
fame
to
his
sonnets
and
among
those
who
most
frequently
repeat
their
soothing
rhymes
how
many
know
any
thing
of
the
existence
of
his
long
poem
on
africa
we
can
not
doubt
that
the
prejudice
which
would
deny
the
superiority
of
an
artist
though
he
should
have
produced
nothing
but
such
sonatas
as
franz
schubert
has
given
us
over
one
who
has
portioned
out
the
insipid
melodies
of
many
operas
which
it
were
useless
to
cite
will
disappear
and
that
in
music
also
we
will
yet
take
into
account
the
eloquence
and
ability
with
which
the
thoughts
and
feelings
are
expressed
whatever
may
be
the
size
of
the
composition
in
which
they
are
developed
or
the
means
employed
to
interpret
them
in
making
an
analysis
of
the
works
of
chopin
we
meet
with
beauties
of
a
high
order
expressions
entirely
new
and
a
harmonic
tissue
as
original
as
erudite
in
his
compositions
boldness
is
always
justified
richness
even
exuberance
never
interferes
with
clearness
singularity
never
degenerates
into
uncouth
fantasticalness
the
sculpturing
is
never
disorderly
the
luxury
of
ornament
never
overloads
the
chaste
eloquence
of
the
principal
lines
his
best
works
abound
in
combinations
which
may
be
said
to
form
an
epoch
in
the
handling
of
musical
style
daring
brilliant
and
attractive
they
disguise
their
profundity
under
so
much
grace
their
science
under
so
many
charms
that
it
is
with
difficulty
we
free
ourselves
sufficiently
from
their
magical
enthrallment
to
judge
coldly
of
their
theoretical
value
their
worth
has
however
already
been
felt
but
it
will
be
more
highly
estimated
when
the
time
arrives
for
a
critical
examination
of
the
services
rendered
by
them
to
art
during
that
period
of
its
course
traversed
by
chopin
it
is
to
him
we
owe
the
extension
of
chords
struck
together
in
arpeggio
or
en
batterie
the
chromatic
sinuosities
of
which
his
pages
offer
such
striking
examples
the
little
groups
of
superadded
notes
falling
like
light
drops
of
pearly
dew
upon
the
melodic
figure
this
species
of
adornment
had
hitherto
been
modeled
only
upon
the
fioritures
of
the
great
old
school
of
italian
song
the
embellishments
for
the
voice
had
been
servilely
copied
by
the
piano
although
become
stereotyped
and
monotonous
he
imparted
to
them
the
charm
of
novelty
surprise
and
variety
unsuited
for
the
vocalist
but
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
character
of
the
instrument
he
invented
the
admirable
harmonic
progressions
which
have
given
a
serious
character
to
pages
which
in
consequence
of
the
lightness
of
their
subject
made
no
pretension
to
any
importance
but
of
what
consequence
is
the
subject
is
it
not
the
idea
which
is
developed
through
it
the
emotion
with
which
it
vibrates
which
expands
elevates
and
ennobles
it
what
tender
melancholy
what
subtlety
what
sagacity
in
the
of
la
fontaine
although
the
subjects
are
so
familiar
the
titles
so
modest
equally
unassuming
are
the
titles
and
subjects
of
the
studies
and
preludes
yet
the
compositions
of
chopin
so
modestly
named
are
not
the
less
types
of
perfection
in
a
mode
created
by
himself
and
stamped
like
all
his
other
works
with
the
high
impress
of
his
poetic
genius
written
in
the
commencement
of
his
career
they
are
characterized
by
a
youthful
vigor
not
to
be
found
in
some
of
his
subsequent
works
even
when
more
elaborate
finished
and
richer
in
combinations
a
vigor
which
is
entirely
lost
in
his
latest
productions
marked
by
an
sensibility
a
morbid
irritability
and
giving
painful
intimations
of
his
own
state
of
suffering
and
exhaustion
if
it
were
our
intention
to
discuss
the
development
of
piano
music
in
the
language
of
the
schools
we
would
dissect
his
magnificent
pages
which
afford
so
rich
a
field
for
scientific
observation
we
would
in
the
first
place
analyze
his
nocturnes
ballades
impromptus
scherzos
which
are
full
of
refinements
of
harmony
never
heard
before
bold
and
of
startling
originality
we
would
also
examine
his
polonaises
mazourkas
waltzes
and
boleros
but
this
is
not
the
time
or
place
for
such
a
study
which
would
be
interesting
only
to
the
adepts
in
counterpoint
and
thoroughbass
it
is
the
feeling
which
overflows
in
all
his
works
which
has
rendered
them
known
and
popular
feeling
of
a
character
eminently
romantic
subjective
individual
peculiar
to
their
author
yet
awakening
immediate
sympathy
appealing
not
alone
to
the
heart
of
that
country
indebted
to
him
for
yet
one
glory
more
but
to
all
who
can
be
touched
by
the
misfortunes
of
exile
or
moved
by
the
tenderness
of
love
not
content
with
success
in
the
field
in
which
he
was
free
to
design
with
such
perfect
grace
the
contours
chosen
by
himself
chopin
also
wished
to
fetter
his
ideal
thoughts
with
classic
chains
his
concertos
and
sonatas
are
beautiful
indeed
but
we
may
discern
in
them
more
effort
than
inspiration
his
creative
genius
was
imperious
fantastic
and
impulsive
his
beauties
were
only
manifested
fully
in
entire
freedom
we
believe
he
offered
violence
to
the
character
of
his
genius
whenever
he
sought
to
subject
it
to
rules
to
classifications
to
regulations
not
his
own
and
which
he
could
not
force
into
harmony
with
the
exactions
of
his
own
mind
he
was
one
of
those
original
beings
whose
graces
are
only
fully
displayed
when
they
have
cut
themselves
adrift
from
all
bondage
and
float
on
at
their
own
wild
will
swayed
only
by
the
ever
undulating
impulses
of
their
own
mobile
natures
he
was
perhaps
induced
to
desire
this
double
success
through
the
example
of
his
friend
mickiewicz
who
having
been
the
first
to
gift
his
country
with
romantic
poetry
forming
a
school
in
sclavic
literature
by
the
publication
of
his
dziady
and
his
romantic
ballads
as
early
as
proved
afterwards
by
the
publication
at
his
grazyna
and
wallenrod
that
he
could
triumph
over
the
difficulties
that
classic
restrictions
oppose
to
inspiration
and
that
when
holding
the
classic
lyre
of
the
ancient
poets
he
was
still
master
in
making
analogous
attempts
we
do
not
think
chopin
has
been
equally
successful
he
could
not
retain
within
the
square
of
an
angular
and
rigid
mould
that
floating
and
indeterminate
contour
which
so
fascinates
us
in
his
graceful
conceptions
he
could
not
introduce
in
its
unyielding
lines
that
shadowy
and
sketchy
indecision
which
disguising
the
skeleton
the
whole
of
form
drapes
it
in
the
mist
of
floating
vapors
such
as
surround
the
maids
of
ossian
when
they
permit
mortals
to
catch
some
vague
yet
lovely
outline
from
their
home
in
the
changing
drifting
blinding
clouds
some
of
these
efforts
however
are
resplendent
with
a
rare
dignity
of
style
and
passages
of
exceeding
interest
of
surprising
grandeur
may
be
found
among
them
as
an
example
of
this
we
cite
the
adagio
of
the
second
concerto
for
which
he
evinced
a
decided
preference
and
which
he
liked
to
repeat
frequently
the
accessory
designs
are
in
his
best
manner
while
the
principal
phrase
is
of
an
admirable
breadth
it
alternates
with
a
recitative
which
assumes
a
minor
key
and
which
seems
to
be
its
antistrophe
the
whole
of
this
piece
is
of
a
perfection
almost
ideal
its
expression
now
radiant
with
light
now
full
of
tender
pathos
it
seems
as
if
one
had
chosen
a
happy
vale
of
tempe
a
magnificent
landscape
flooded
with
summer
glow
and
lustre
as
a
background
for
the
rehearsal
of
some
dire
scene
of
mortal
anguish
a
bitter
and
irreparable
regret
seizes
the
human
heart
even
in
the
midst
of
the
incomparable
splendor
of
external
nature
this
contrast
is
sustained
by
a
fusion
of
tones
a
softening
of
gloomy
hues
which
prevent
the
intrusion
of
aught
rude
or
brusque
that
might
awaken
a
dissonance
in
the
touching
impression
produced
which
while
saddening
joy
soothes
and
softens
the
bitterness
of
sorrow
it
would
be
impossible
to
pass
in
silence
the
funeral
march
inserted
in
the
first
sonata
which
was
arranged
for
the
orchestra
and
performed
for
the
first
time
at
his
own
obsequies
what
other
accents
could
have
been
found
capable
of
expressing
with
the
same
effect
the
emotions
the
tears
which
should
accompany
to
the
last
long
sleep
one
who
had
taught
in
a
manner
so
sublime
how
great
losses
should
be
mourned
we
once
heard
it
remarked
by
a
native
of
his
own
country
these
pages
could
only
have
been
written
by
a
pole
all
that
the
funeral
train
of
an
entire
nation
weeping
its
own
ruin
and
death
can
be
imagined
to
feel
of
desolating
woe
of
majestic
sorrow
wails
in
the
musical
ringing
of
this
passing
bell
mourns
in
the
tolling
of
this
solemn
knell
as
it
accompanies
the
mighty
escort
on
its
way
to
the
still
city
of
the
dead
the
intensity
of
mystic
hope
the
devout
appeal
to
superhuman
pity
to
infinite
mercy
to
a
dread
justice
which
numbers
every
cradle
and
watches
every
tomb
the
exalted
resignation
which
has
wreathed
so
much
grief
with
halos
so
luminous
the
noble
endurance
of
so
many
disasters
with
the
inspired
heroism
of
christian
martyrs
who
know
not
to
despair
resound
in
this
melancholy
chant
whose
voice
of
supplication
breaks
the
heart
all
of
most
pure
of
most
holy
of
most
believing
of
most
hopeful
in
the
hearts
of
children
women
and
priests
resounds
quivers
and
trembles
there
with
irresistible
vibrations
we
feel
it
is
not
the
death
of
a
single
warrior
we
mourn
while
other
heroes
live
to
avenge
him
but
that
a
whole
generation
of
warriors
has
forever
fallen
leaving
the
death
song
to
be
chanted
but
by
wailing
women
weeping
children
and
helpless
priests
yet
this
melopee
so
funereal
so
full
of
desolating
woe
is
of
such
penetrating
sweetness
that
we
can
scarcely
deem
it
of
this
earth
these
sounds
in
which
the
wild
passion
of
human
anguish
seems
chilled
by
awe
and
softened
by
distance
impose
a
profound
meditation
as
if
chanted
by
angels
they
floated
already
in
the
heavens
the
cry
of
a
anguish
mounting
to
the
very
throne
of
god
the
appeal
of
human
grief
from
the
lyre
of
seraphs
neither
cries
nor
hoarse
groans
nor
impious
blasphemies
nor
furious
imprecations
trouble
for
a
moment
the
sublime
sorrow
of
the
plaint
it
breathes
upon
the
ear
like
the
rhythmed
sighs
of
angels
the
antique
face
of
grief
is
entirely
excluded
nothing
recalls
the
fury
of
cassandra
the
prostration
of
priam
the
frenzy
of
hecuba
the
despair
of
the
trojan
captives
a
sublime
faith
destroying
in
the
survivors
of
this
christian
ilion
the
bitterness
of
anguish
and
the
cowardice
of
despair
their
sorrow
is
no
longer
marked
by
earthly
weakness
raising
itself
from
the
soil
wet
with
blood
and
tears
it
springs
forward
to
implore
god
and
having
nothing
more
to
hope
from
earth
it
supplicates
the
supreme
judge
with
prayers
so
poignant
that
our
hearts
in
listening
break
under
the
weight
of
an
august
compassion
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
all
the
compositions
of
chopin
are
deprived
of
the
feelings
which
he
has
deemed
best
to
suppress
in
this
great
work
not
so
perhaps
human
nature
is
not
capable
of
maintaining
always
this
mood
of
energetic
abnegation
of
courageous
submission
we
meet
with
breathings
of
stifled
rage
of
suppressed
anger
in
many
passages
of
his
writings
and
many
of
his
studies
as
well
as
his
scherzos
depict
a
concentrated
exasperation
and
despair
which
are
sometimes
manifested
in
bitter
irony
sometimes
in
intolerant
hauteur
these
dark
apostrophes
of
his
muse
have
attracted
less
attention
have
been
less
fully
understood
than
his
poems
of
more
tender
coloring
the
personal
character
of
chopin
had
something
to
do
with
this
general
misconception
kind
courteous
and
affable
of
tranquil
and
almost
joyous
manners
he
would
not
suffer
the
secret
convulsions
which
agitated
him
to
be
even
suspected
his
character
was
indeed
not
easily
understood
a
thousand
subtle
shades
mingling
crossing
contradicting
and
disguising
each
other
rendered
it
almost
undecipherable
at
a
first
view
as
is
usually
the
case
with
the
sclaves
it
was
difficult
to
read
the
recesses
of
his
mind
with
them
loyalty
and
candor
familiarity
and
the
most
captivating
ease
of
manner
by
no
means
imply
confidence
or
impulsive
frankness
like
the
twisted
folds
of
a
serpent
rolled
upon
itself
their
feelings
are
half
hidden
half
revealed
it
requires
a
most
attentive
examination
to
follow
the
coiled
linking
of
the
glittering
rings
it
would
be
naive
to
interpret
literally
their
courtesy
full
of
compliment
their
assumed
humility
the
forms
of
this
politeness
this
modesty
have
their
solution
in
their
manners
in
which
their
ancient
connection
with
the
east
may
be
strangely
traced
without
having
in
the
least
degree
acquired
the
taciturnity
of
the
mussulman
they
have
yet
learned
from
it
a
distrustful
reserve
upon
all
subjects
which
touch
upon
the
more
delicate
and
personal
chords
of
the
heart
when
they
speak
of
themselves
we
may
almost
always
be
certain
that
they
keep
some
concealment
in
reserve
which
assures
them
the
advantage
in
intellect
or
feeling
they
suffer
their
interrogator
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
some
circumstance
some
mobile
secret
through
the
unveiling
of
which
they
would
be
more
admired
or
less
esteemed
and
which
they
well
know
how
to
hide
under
the
subtle
smile
of
an
almost
imperceptible
mockery
delighting
in
the
pleasure
of
mystification
from
the
most
spiritual
or
comic
to
the
most
bitter
and
melancholy
they
may
perhaps
find
in
this
deceptive
raillery
an
external
formula
of
disdain
for
the
veiled
expression
of
the
superiority
which
they
internally
claim
but
which
claim
they
veil
with
the
caution
and
astuteness
natural
to
the
oppressed
the
frail
and
sickly
organization
of
chopin
not
permitting
him
the
energetic
expression
of
his
passions
he
gave
to
his
friends
only
the
gentle
and
affectionate
phase
of
his
nature
in
the
busy
eager
life
of
large
cities
where
no
one
has
time
to
study
the
destiny
of
another
where
every
one
is
judged
by
his
external
activity
very
few
think
it
worth
while
to
attempt
to
penetrate
the
enigma
of
individual
character
those
who
enjoyed
familiar
intercourse
with
chopin
could
not
be
blind
to
the
impatience
and
ennui
he
experienced
in
being
upon
the
calm
character
of
his
manners
so
promptly
believed
and
may
not
the
artist
revenge
the
man
as
his
health
was
too
frail
to
permit
him
to
give
vent
to
his
impatience
through
the
vehemence
of
his
execution
he
sought
to
compensate
himself
by
pouring
this
bitterness
over
those
pages
which
he
loved
to
hear
performed
with
a
vigor
footnote
it
was
his
delight
to
hear
them
executed
by
the
great
liszt
translator
which
he
could
not
himself
always
command
pages
which
are
indeed
full
of
the
impassioned
feelings
of
a
man
suffering
deeply
from
wounds
which
he
does
not
choose
to
avow
thus
around
a
gaily
flagged
yet
sinking
ship
float
the
fallen
spars
and
scattered
fragments
torn
by
warring
winds
and
surging
waves
from
its
shattered
sides
such
emotions
have
been
of
so
much
the
more
importance
in
the
life
of
chopin
because
they
have
deeply
influenced
the
character
of
his
compositions
among
the
pages
published
under
such
influences
may
be
traced
much
analogous
to
the
subtleties
of
jean
paul
who
found
it
necessary
in
order
to
move
hearts
macerated
by
passion
blazes
through
suffering
to
make
use
of
the
surprises
caused
by
natural
and
physical
phenomena
to
evoke
the
sensations
of
luxurious
terrors
arising
from
occurrences
not
to
be
foreseen
in
the
natural
order
of
things
to
awaken
the
morbid
excitements
of
a
dreamy
brain
step
by
step
the
tortured
mind
of
chopin
arrived
at
a
state
of
sickly
irritability
his
emotions
increased
to
a
feverish
tremor
producing
that
involution
that
tortuosity
of
thought
which
mark
his
latest
works
almost
suffocating
under
the
oppression
of
repressed
feelings
using
art
only
to
repeat
and
rehearse
for
himself
his
own
internal
tragedy
after
having
wearied
emotion
he
began
to
subtilize
it
his
melodies
are
actually
tormented
a
nervous
and
restless
sensibility
leads
to
an
obstinate
persistence
in
the
handling
and
rehandling
and
a
reiterated
pursuit
of
the
tortured
motifs
which
impress
us
as
painfully
as
the
sight
of
those
physical
or
mental
agonies
which
we
know
can
find
relief
only
in
death
chopin
was
a
victim
to
a
disease
without
hope
which
growing
more
envenomed
from
year
to
year
took
him
while
yet
young
from
those
who
loved
him
and
laid
him
in
his
still
grave
as
in
the
fair
form
of
some
beautiful
victim
the
marks
of
the
grasping
claws
of
the
fierce
bird
of
prey
which
has
destroyed
it
may
be
found
so
in
the
productions
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
the
traces
of
the
bitter
sufferings
which
devoured
his
heart
are
painfully
visible
chapter

national
character
of
the
polonaise
oginski
meyseder
weber
chopin
his
polonaise
in

minor
polonaise
fantaisie
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
tortured
aberrations
of
feeling
to
which
we
have
just
alluded
ever
injure
the
harmonic
tissue
in
the
works
of
chopin
on
the
contrary
they
only
render
it
a
more
curious
subject
for
analysis
such
eccentricities
rarely
occur
in
his
more
generally
known
and
admired
compositions
his
polonaises
which
are
less
studied
than
they
merit
on
account
of
the
difficulties
presented
by
their
perfect
execution
are
to
be
classed
among
his
highest
inspirations
they
never
remind
us
of
the
mincing
and
affected
polonaises
a
la
pompadour
which
our
orchestras
have
introduced
into
our
virtuosi
in
concerts
or
of
those
to
be
found
in
our
parlor
repertories
filled
as
they
invariably
are
with
hackneyed
collections
of
music
marked
by
insipidity
and
mannerism
his
polonaises
characterized
by
an
energetic
rhythm
galvanize
and
electrify
the
torpor
of
indifference
the
most
noble
traditional
feelings
of
ancient
poland
are
embodied
in
them
the
firm
resolve
and
calm
gravity
of
its
men
of
other
days
breathe
through
these
compositions
generally
of
a
martial
character
courage
and
daring
are
rendered
with
that
simplicity
of
expression
said
to
be
a
distinctive
trait
of
this
warlike
people
they
bring
vividly
before
the
imagination
the
ancient
poles
as
we
find
them
described
in
their
chronicles
gifted
with
powerful
organizations
subtle
intellects
indomitable
courage
and
earnest
piety
mingled
with
courtesy
and
a
gallantry
which
never
deserted
them
whether
on
the
eve
of
battle
during
its
exciting
course
in
the
triumph
of
victory
or
amidst
the
gloom
of
defeat
so
inherent
was
this
gallantry
and
chivalric
courtesy
in
their
nature
that
in
spite
of
the
restraint
which
their
customs
resembling
those
of
their
neighbours
and
enemies
the
infidels
of
stamboul
induced
them
to
exercise
upon
their
women
confining
them
in
the
limits
of
domestic
life
and
always
holding
them
under
legal
wardship
they
still
manifest
themselves
in
their
annals
in
which
they
have
glorified
and
immortalized
queens
who
were
saints
vassals
who
became
queens
beautiful
subjects
for
whose
sake
some
periled
while
others
lost
crowns
a
terrible
sforza
an
intriguing
and
a
coquettish
gonzaga
the
poles
of
olden
times
united
a
manly
firmness
with
this
peculiar
chivalric
devotion
to
the
objects
of
their
love
a
characteristic
example
of
this
may
be
seen
in
the
letters
of
jean
sobieski
to
his
wife
they
were
dictated
in
face
of
the
standards
of
the
crescent
numerous
as
the
ears
in
a
tender
and
devoted
as
is
their
character
such
traits
caught
a
singular
and
imposing
hue
from
the
grave
deportment
of
these
men
so
dignified
that
they
might
almost
be
accused
of
pomposity
it
was
next
to
impossible
that
they
should
not
contract
a
taste
for
this
stateliness
when
we
consider
that
they
had
almost
always
before
them
the
most
exquisite
type
of
gravity
of
manner
in
the
followers
of
islam
whose
qualities
they
appreciated
and
appropriated
even
while
engaged
in
repelling
their
invasions
like
the
infidel
they
knew
how
to
preface
their
acts
by
an
intelligent
deliberation
so
that
the
device
of
prince
boleslas
of
pomerania
was
always
present
to
them
first
weigh
it
then
dare
erst
wieg
dann
wag
such
deliberation
imparted
a
kind
of
stately
pride
to
their
movements
while
it
left
them
in
possession
of
an
ease
and
freedom
of
spirit
accessible
to
the
lightest
cares
of
tenderness
to
the
most
trivial
interests
of
the
passing
hour
to
the
most
transient
feelings
of
the
heart
as
it
made
part
of
their
code
of
honor
to
make
those
who
interfered
with
them
in
their
more
tender
interests
pay
dearly
for
it
so
they
knew
how
to
beautify
life
and
better
still
they
knew
how
to
love
those
who
embellished
it
to
revere
those
who
rendered
it
precious
to
them
their
chivalric
heroism
was
sanctioned
by
their
grave
and
haughty
dignity
an
intelligent
and
premeditated
conviction
added
the
force
of
reason
to
the
energy
of
impulsive
virtue
thus
they
have
succeeded
in
winning
the
admiration
of
all
ages
of
all
minds
even
that
of
their
most
determined
adversaries
they
were
characterized
by
qualities
rarely
found
together
the
description
of
which
would
appear
almost
paradoxical
reckless
wisdom
daring
prudence
and
fanatic
fatalism
the
most
marked
and
celebrated
historic
manifestation
of
these
properties
is
to
be
found
in
the
expedition
of
sobieski
when
he
saved
vienna
and
gave
a
mortal
blow
to
the
ottoman
empire
which
was
at
last
conquered
in
the
long
struggle
sustained
on
both
sides
with
so
much
prowess
and
glory
with
so
much
mutual
deference
between
opponents
as
magnanimous
in
their
truces
as
irreconcilable
in
their
combats
while
listening
to
some
of
the
polonaises
of
chopin
we
can
almost
catch
the
firm
nay
the
more
than
firm
the
heavy
resolute
tread
of
men
bravely
facing
all
the
bitter
injustice
which
the
most
cruel
and
relentless
destiny
can
offer
with
the
manly
pride
of
unblenching
courage
the
progress
of
the
music
suggests
to
our
imagination
such
magnificent
groups
as
were
designed
by
paul
veronese
robed
in
the
rich
costume
of
days
long
past
we
see
passing
at
intervals
before
us
brocades
of
gold
velvets
damasked
satins
silvery
soft
and
flexile
sables
hanging
sleeves
gracefully
thrown
back
upon
the
shoulders
embossed

luxurious

the
faded
background
of

long
passed
these
vivid
groups
start
forth
gorgeous
carpets
from
persia
lie
at
their
feet
filigreed
furniture
from
constantinople
stands
around
all
is
marked
by
the
sumptuous
prodigality
of
the
magnates
who
drew
in
ruby
goblets
embossed
with
medallions
wine
from
the
fountains
of
tokay
and
shoed
their
fleet
arabian
steeds
with
silver
who
surmounted
all
their
escutcheons
with
the
same
crown
which
the
fate
of
an
election
might
render
a
royal
one
and
which
causing
them
to
despise
all
other
titles
was
alone
worn
as
insigne
of
their
glorious
equality
those
who
have
seen
the
polonaise
danced
even
as
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
declare
that
its
style
has
changed
so
much
that
it
is
now
almost
impossible
to
divine
its
primitive
character
as
very
few
national
dances
have
succeeded
in
preserving
their
racy
originality
we
may
imagine
when
we
take
into
consideration
the
changes
which
have
occurred
to
what
a
degree
this
has
degenerated
the
polonaise
is
without
rapid
movements
without
any
true
steps
in
the
artistic
sense
of
the
word
intended
rather
for
display
than
for
the
exhibition
of
seductive
grace
so
we
may
readily
conceive
it
must
lose
all
its
haughty
importance
its
pompous
when
the
dancers
are
deprived
of
the
accessories
necessary
to
enable
them
to
animate
its
simple
form
by
dignified
yet
vivid
gestures
by
appropriate
and
expressive
pantomime
and
when
the
costume
peculiarly
fitted
for
it
is
no
longer
worn
it
has
indeed
become
decidedly
monotonous
a
mere
circulating
promenade
exciting
but
little
interest
unless
we
could
see
it
danced
by
some
of
the
old
regime
who
still
wear
the
ancient
costume
or
listen
to
their
animated
descriptions
of
it
we
can
form
no
conception
of
the
numerous
incidents
the
scenic
pantomime
which
once
rendered
it
so
effective
by
a
rare
exception
this
dance
was
designed
to
exhibit
the
men
to
display
manly
beauty
to
set
off
noble
and
dignified
deportment
martial
yet
courtly
bearing
martial
yet
courtly
do
not
these
two
epithets
almost
define
the
polish
character
in
the
original
the
very
name
of
the
dance
is
masculine
it
is
only
in
consequence
of
a
misconception
that
it
has
been
translated
in
other
tongues
into
the
feminine
gender
those
who
have
never
seen
the
kontusz
worn
it
is
a
kind
of
occidental
kaftan
as
it
is
the
robe
of
the
orientals
modified
to
suit
the
customs
of
an
active
life
unfettered
by
the
stagnant
resignation
taught
by
fatalism
a
sort
of
feredgi
often
trimmed
with
fur
forcing
the
wearer
to
make
frequent
movements
susceptible
of
grace
and
coquetry
by
which
the
flowing
sleeves
are
thrown
backward
can
scarcely
imagine
the
bearing
the
slow
bending
the
quick
rising
the
finesse
of
the
delicate
pantomime
displayed
by
the
ancients
as
they
defiled
in
a
polonaise
as
though
in
a
military
parade
not
suffering
their
fingers
to
remain
idle
but
sometimes
occupying
them
in
playing
with
the
long
moustache
sometimes
with
the
handle
of
the
sword
both
moustache
and
sword
were
essential
parts
of
the
costume
and
were
indeed
objects
of
vanity
with
all
ages
diamonds
and
sapphires
frequently
sparkled
upon
the
arms
worn
suspended
from
belts
of
cashmere
or
from
sashes
of
silk
embroidered
with
gold
displaying
to
advantage
forms
always
slightly
corpulent
the
moustache
often
veiled
without
quite
hiding
some
scar
far
more
effective
than
the
most
brilliant
array
of
jewels
the
dress
of
the
men
rivaled
that
of
the
women
in
the
luxury
of
the
material
worn
in
the
value
of
the
precious
stones
and
in
the
variety
of
vivid
colors
this
love
of
adornment
is
also
found
among
the
hungarians
footnote
the
hungarian
costume
worn
by
prince
nicholas
esterhazy
at
the
coronation
of
george
the
fourth
is
still
remembered
in
england
it
was
valued
at
several
millions
of
florins
as
may
be
seen
in
their
buttons
made
of
jewels
the
rings
forming
a
necessary
part
of
their
dress
the
wrought
clasps
for
the
neck
the
aigrettes
and
plumes
adorning
the
cap
made
of
velvet
of
some
brilliant
hue
to
know
how
to
take
off
to
put
on
to
manoeuvre
the
cap
with
all
possible
grace
constituted
almost
an
art
during
the
progress
of
a
polonaise
this
became
an
object
of
especial
remark
because
the
cavalier
of
the
leading
pair
as
commandant
of
the
file
gave
the
mute
word
of
command
which
was
immediately
obeyed
and
imitated
by
the
rest
of
the
train
the
master
of
the
house
in
which
the
ball
was
given
always
opened
it
himself
by
leading
off
in
this
dance
his
partner
was
selected
neither
for
her
beauty
nor
youth
the
most
highly
honored
lady
present
was
always
chosen
this
phalanx
by
whose
evolutions
every
fete
was
commenced
was
not
formed
only
of
the
young
it
was
composed
of
the
most
distinguished
as
well
as
of
the
most
beautiful
a
grand
review
a
dazzling
exhibition
of
all
the
distinction
present
was
offered
as
the
highest
pleasure
of
the
festival
after
the
host
came
next
in
order
the
guests
of
the
greatest
consideration
who
choosing
their
partners
some
from
friendship
some
from
policy
or
from
desire
of
advancement
some
from
love
followed
closely
his
steps
his
task
was
a
far
more
complicated
one
than
it
is
at
present
he
was
expected
to
conduct
the
files
under
his
guidance
through
a
thousand
capricious
meanderings
through
long
suites
of
apartments
lined
by
guests
who
were
to
take
a
later
part
in
this
brilliant
cortege
they
liked
to
be
conducted
through
distant
galleries
through
the
parterres
of
illuminated
gardens
through
the
groves
of
shrubbery
where
distant
echoes
of
the
music
alone
reached
the
ear
which
as
if
in
revenge
greeted
them
with
redoubled
sound
and
blowing
of
trumpets
upon
their
return
to
the
principal
saloon
as
the
spectators
ranged
like
rows
of
hedges
along
the
route
were
continually
changing
and
never
ceased
for
a
moment
to
observe
all
their
movements
the
dancers
never
forgot
that
dignity
of
bearing
and
address
which
won
for
them
the
admiration
of
women
and
excited
the
jealousy
of
men
vain
and
joyous
the
host
would
have
deemed
himself
wanting
in
courtesy
to
his
guests
had
he
not
evinced
to
them
which
he
did
sometimes
with
a
piquant
naivete
the
pride
he
felt
in
seeing
himself
surrounded
by
persons
so
illustrious
and
partisans
so
noble
all
striving
through
the
splendor
of
the
attire
chosen
to
visit
him
to
show
their
high
sense
of
the
honor
in
which
they
held
him
guided
by
him
in
their
first
circuit
they
were
led
through
long
windings
where
unexpected
turns
views
and
openings
had
been
arranged
beforehand
to
cause
surprise
where
architectural
deceptions
decorations
and
shifting
scenes
had
been
studiously
adapted
to
increase
the
pleasure
of
the
festival
if
any
monument
or
inscription
fitted
for
the
occasion
lay
upon
the
long
line
of
route
from
which
some
complimentary
homage
might
be
drawn
to
the
most
valiant
or
the
most
beautiful
the
honors
were
gracefully
done
by
the
host
the
more
unexpected
the
surprises
arranged
for
these
excursions
the
more
imagination
evinced
in
their
invention
the
louder
were
the
applauses
from
the
younger
part
of
the
society
the
more
ardent
the
exclamations
of
delight
and
silvery
sounds
of
merry
laughter
greeted
pleasantly
the
ears
of
the
who
having
thus
succeeded
in
achieving
his
reputation
became
a
privileged
corypheus
a
leader
par
excellence
if
he
had
already
attained
a
certain
age
he
was
greeted
on
his
return
from
such
circuits
by
frequent
deputations
of
young
ladies
who
came
in
the
name
of
all
present
to
thank
and
congratulate
him
through
their
vivid
descriptions
these
pretty
wanderers
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
guests
and
increased
the
eagerness
for
the
formation
of
the
succeeding
polonaises
among
those
who
though
they
did
not
make
part
of
the
procession
still
watched
its
passage
in
motionless
attention
as
if
gazing
upon
the
flashing
line
of
light
of
some
brilliant
meteor
in
this
land
of
aristocratic
democracy
the
numerous
dependents
of
the
great
seigniorial
houses
too
poor
indeed
to
take
part
in
the
fete
yet
only
excluded
from
it
by
their
own
volition
all
however
noble
some
even
more
noble
than
their
lords
being
all
present
it
was
considered
highly
desirable
to
dazzle
them
and
this
flowing
chain
of
and
gorgeous
light
like
an
immense
serpent
with
its
glittering
rings
sometimes
wreathed
its
linked
folds
sometimes
uncoiled
its
entire
length
to
display
its
brilliancy
through
the
whole
line
of
its
undulating
animated
surface
in
the
most
vivid
scintillations
accompanying
the
shifting
hues
with
the
silvery
sounds
of
chains
of
gold
ringing
like
muffled
bells
with
the
rustling
of
the
heavy
sweep
of
gorgeous
damasks
and
with
the
dragging
of
jewelled
swords
upon
the
floor
the
murmuring
sound
of
many
voices
announced
the
approach
of
this
animated
varied
and
glittering
but
the
genius
of
hospitality
never
deficient
in
courtesy
and
which
even
while
preserving
the
touching
simplicity
of
primitive
manners
inspired
in
poland
all
the
refinements
of
the
most
advanced
state
of
civilization
how
could
it
be
exiled
from
the
details
of
a
dance
so
eminently
polish
after
the
host
had
by
inaugurating
the
fete
rendered
due
homage
to
all
who
were
present
any
one
of
his
guests
had
the
right
to
claim
his
place
with
the
lady
whom
he
had
honored
by
his
choice
the
new
claimant
clapping
his
hands
to
arrest
for
a
moment
the
ever
moving
cortege
bowed
before
the
partner
of
the
host
begging
her
graciously
to
accept
the
change
while
the
host
from
whom
she
had
been
taken
made
the
same
appeal
to
the
lady
next
in
course
this
example
was
followed
by
the
whole
train
constantly
changing
partners
whenever
a
new
cavalier
claimed
the
honor
of
leading
the
one
first
chosen
by
the
host
the
ladies
remained
in
the
same
succession
during
the
whole
course
while
on
the
contrary
as
the
gentlemen
continually
replaced
each
other
he
who
had
commenced
the
dance
would
in
its
progress
become
the
last
if
not
indeed
entirely
excluded
before
its
close
each
cavalier
who
placed
himself
in
turn
at
the
head
of
the
column
tried
to
surpass
his
predecessors
in
the
novelty
of
the
combinations
of
his
opening
in
the
complications
of
the
windings
through
which
he
led
the
expectant
cortege
and
this
course
even
when
restricted
to
a
single
saloon
might
be
made
remarkable
by
the
designing
of
graceful
arabesques
or
the
involved
tracing
of
enigmatical
ciphers
he
made
good
his
claim
to
the
place
he
had
solicited
and
displayed
his
skill
by
inventing
close
complicated
and
inextricable
figures
by
describing
them
with
so
much
certainty
and
accuracy
that
the
living
ribbon
turned
and
twisted
as
it
might
be
was
never
broken
in
the
loosing
of
its
wreathed
knots
and
by
so
leading
that
no
confusion
or
graceless
jostling
should
result
from
the
complicated
torsion
the
succeeding
couples
who
had
only
to
follow
the
figures
already
given
and
thus
continue
the
impulsion
were
not
permitted
to
drag
themselves
lazily
and
listlessly
along
the
parquet
the
step
was
rhythmic
cadenced
and
undulating
the
whole
form
swayed
by
graceful
wavings
and
harmonious
balancings
they
were
careful
never
to
advance
with
too
much
haste
nor
to
replace
each
other
as
if
driven
on
by
some
urgent
necessity
on
they
glided
like
swans
descending
a
tranquil
stream
their
flexile
forms
swayed
by
the
ebb
and
swell
of
unseen
and
gentle
waves
sometimes
the
gentleman
offered
the
right
sometimes
the
left
hand
to
his
partner
touching
only
the
points
of
her
fingers
or
clasping
the
slight
hand
within
his
own
he
passed
now
to
her
right
now
to
her
left
without
yielding
the
snowy
treasure
these
complicated
movements
being
instantaneously
imitated
by
every
pair
ran
like
an
electric
shiver
through
the
whole
length
of
this
gigantic
serpent
although
apparently
occupied
and
absorbed
by
these
multiplied
manoeuvres
the
cavalier
yet
found
time
to
bend
to
his
lady
and
whisper
sweet
flatteries
in
her
ear
if
she
were
young
if
young
no
longer
to
repose
confidence
to
urge
requests
or
to
repeat
to
her
the
news
of
the
hour
then
haughtily
raising
himself
he
would
make
the
metal
of
his
arms
ring
caress
his
thick
moustache
giving
to
all
his
features
an
expression
so
vivid
that
the
lady
was
forced
to
respond
by
the
animation
of
her
own
countenance
thus
it
was
no
hackneyed
and
senseless
promenade
which
they
executed
it
was
rather
a
parade
in
which
the
whole
splendor
of
the
society
was
exhibited
gratified
with
its
own
admiration
conscious
of
its
own
elegance
brilliancy
nobility
and
courtesy
it
was
a
constant
display
of
its
lustre
its
glory
its
renown

gray

camps
or
in
the
strife
of
courtly

and
most
brilliant
women
present
honor
and
glory
rendered
ages
equal
and
caused
years
to
be
forgotten
in
this
dance
nay
more
they
gave
an
advantage
even
over
love
it
was
while
listening
to
the
animated
descriptions
of
the
almost
forgotten
evolutions
and
dignified
capabilities
of
this
truly
national
dance
from
the
lips
of
those
who
would
never
abandon
the
ancient
zupan
and
kontusz
and
who
still
wore
their
hair
closely
cut
round
their
temples
as
it
had
been
worn
by
their
ancestors
that
we
first
fully
understood
in
what
a
high
degree
this
haughty
nation
possessed
the
innate
instinct
of
its
own
exhibition
and
how
entirely
it
had
succeeded
through
its
natural
grace
and
genius
in
poetizing
its
love
of
ostentation
by
draping
it
in
the
charms
of
noble
emotions
and
wrapping
round
it
the
glittering
robes
of
martial
glory
when
we
visited
the
country
of
chopin
whose
memory
always
accompanied
us
like
a
faithful
guide
who
constantly
keeps
our
interest
excited
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
meet
with
some
of
the
peculiar
characters
daily
growing
more
rare
because
european
civilization
even
where
it
does
not
modify
the
basis
of
character
effaces
asperities
and
moulds
exterior
forms
we
there
encountered
some
of
those
men
gifted
with
superior
intellect
cultivated
and
strongly
developed
by
a
life
of
incessant
action
yet
whose
horizon
does
not
extend
beyond
the
limits
of
their
own
country
their
own
society
their
own
traditions
during
our
intercourse
facilitated
by
an
interpreter
with
these
men
of
past
days
we
were
able
to
study
them
and
to
understand
the
secret
of
their
greatness
it
was
really
curious
to
observe
the
inimitable
originality
caused
by
the
utter
exclusiveness
of
the
view
taken
by
them
this
limited
cultivation
while
it
greatly
diminishes
the
value
of
their
ideas
upon
many
subjects
at
the
same
time
gifts
the
mind
with
a
peculiar
force
almost
resembling
the
keen
scent
and
the
acute
perceptions
of
the
savage
for
all
the
things
near
and
dear
to
it
only
from
a
mind
of
this
peculiar
training
marked
by
a
concentrative
energy
that
nothing
can
distract
from
its
course
every
thing
beyond
the
circle
of
its
own
nationality
remaining
alien
to
it
can
we
hope
to
obtain
an
exact
picture
of
the
past
for
it
alone
like
a
faithful
mirror
reflects
it
in
its
primal
coloring
preserves
its
proper
lights
and
shades
and
gives
it
with
its
varied
and
picturesque
accompaniments
from
such
minds
alone
can
we
obtain
with
the
ritual
of
customs
which
are
rapidly
becoming
extinct
the
spirit
from
which
they
emanated
chopin
was
born
too
late
and
left
the
domestic
hearth
too
early
to
be
himself
in
possession
of
this
spirit
but
he
had
known
many
examples
of
it
and
through
the
memories
which
surrounded
his
childhood
even
more
fully
than
through
the
literature
and
history
of
his
country
he
found
by
induction
the
secrets
of
its
ancient
prestige
which
he
evoked
from
the
dim
and
dark
land
of
forgetfulness
and
through
the
magic
of
his
poetic
art
endowed
with
immortal
youth
poets
are
better
comprehended
and
appreciated
by
those
who
have
made
themselves
familiar
with
the
countries
which
inspired
their
songs

more
fully
understood
by
those
who
have
seen
the
parthenon
bathed
in
the
radiance
of
its
limpid
atmosphere

by
those
familiar
with
the
mountains
of
scotland
with
their
heavy
veils
and
long
wreaths
of
mist
the
feelings
which
inspired
the
creations
of
chopin
can
only
be
fully
appreciated
by
those
who
have
visited
his
country

must
have
seen
the
giant
shadows
of
past
centuries
gradually
increasing
and
veiling
the
ground
as
the
gloomy
night
of
despair
rolled
on

must
have
felt
the
electric
and
mystic
influence
of
that
strange
phantom
of
glory
forever
haunting
martyred
poland
even
in
the
gayest
hours
of
festival
it
appalls
and
saddens
all
hearts
whenever
a
tale
of
past
renown
a
commemoration
of
slaughtered
heroes
is
given
an
allusion
to
national
prowess
is
made
its
resurrection
from
the
grave
is
instantaneous
it
takes
its
place
in
the
spreading
an
electric
terror
mingled
with
intense
admiration
a
shudder
wild
and
mystic
as
that
which
seizes
upon
the
peasants
of
ukraine
when
the
beautiful
virgin
white
as
death
with
her
girdle
of
crimson
is
suddenly
seen
gliding
through
their
tranquil
village
while
her
shadowy
hand
marks
with
blood
the
door
of
each
cottage
doomed
to
destruction
during
many
centuries
the
civilization
of
poland
was
entirely
peculiar
and
aboriginal
it
did
not
resemble
that
of
any
other
country
and
indeed
it
seems
destined
to
remain
forever
unique
in
its
kind
as
different
from
the
german
feudalism
which
neighboured
it
upon
the
west
as
from
the
conquering
spirit
of
the
turks
which
disquieted
it
on
the
east
it
resembled
europe
in
its
chivalric
christianity
in
its
eagerness
to
attack
the
infidel
even
while
receiving
instruction
in
sagacious
policy
in
military
tactics
and
sententious
reasoning
from
the
masters
of
byzantium
by
the
assumption
at
the
same
time
of
the
heroic
qualities
of
mussulman
fanaticism
and
the
sublime
virtues
of
christian
sanctity
and
humility
footnote
it
is
well
known
with
how
many
glorious
names
poland
has
enriched
the
martyrology
of
the
church
in
memorial
of
the
countless
martyrs
it
had
offered
the
roman

granted
to
the
order
of
trinitarians

duty
it
was
to
redeem
from

the
general
culture
of
latin
letters
the
knowledge
of
and
love
for
italian
and
french
literature
gave
a
lustre
and
classical
polish
to
the
startling
contrasts
we
hare
attempted
to
describe
such
a
civilization
must
necessarily
impress
all
its
manifestations
with
its
own
seal
as
was
natural
for
a
nation
always
engaged
in
war
forced
to
reserve
its
deeds
of
prowess
and
valor
for
its
enemies
upon
the
field
of
battle
it
was
not
famed
for
the
romances
of
for
tournaments
or
jousts
it
replaced
the
excitement
and
splendor
of
the
mimic
war
by
characteristic
fetes
in
which
the
gorgeousness
of
personal
display
formed
the
principal
feature
there
is
certainly
nothing
new
in
the
assertion
that
national
character
is
in
some
degree
revealed
by
national
dances
we
believe
however
there
are
none
in
which
the
creative
impulses
can
be
so
readily
deciphered
or
the
ensemble
traced
with
so
much
simplicity
as
in
the
polonaise
in
consequence
of
the
varied
episodes
which
each
individual
was
expected
to
insert
in
the
general
frame
the
national
intuitions
were
revealed
with
the
greatest
diversity
when
these
distinctive
marks
disappeared
when
the
original
flame
no
longer
burned
when
no
one
invented
scenes
for
the
intermediary
pauses
when
to
accomplish
mechanically
the
obligatory
circuit
of
a
saloon
was
all
that
was
requisite
nothing
but
the
skeleton
of
departed
glory
remained
we
would
certainly
have
hesitated
to
speak
of
the
polonaise
after
the
exquisite
verses
which
mickiewicz
has
consecrated
to
it
and
the
admirable
description
which
he
has
given
of
it
in
the
last
canto
of
the
pan
tadeusz
but
that
this
description
is
to
be
found
only
in
a
work
not
yet
translated
and
consequently
only
known
to
the
compatriots
of
the
poet

it
has
been
translated

would
have
been
presumptuous
even
under
another
form
to
have
ventured
upon
a
subject
already
sketched
and
colored
by
such
a
hand
in
his
romantic
epic
in
which
beauties
of
the
highest
order
are
set
in
such
a
scene
as
ruysdael
loved
to
paint

thrown
through

its
snowy
bark
is
deeply
stained
as
if

from
its
fresh
and
gaping
wounds
the
scenes
of

tadeusz
are
laid
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
when
many
still
lived
who
retained
the
profound
feeling
and
grave
deportment
of
the
ancient
poles
mingled
with
those
who
were
even
then
under
the
sway
of
the
graceful

giddying
passions
of
modern
origin
these
striking
and

types
existing
together
at

rapidly
disappearing

universal
conventionalism

is
at

the
higher
classes
in
all

in
all
countries
without

chopin
frequently
drew
fresh
inspiration
from
this
noble
poem
whose
scenes
so
forcibly
depict
the
emotions
he
best
loved
to
reproduce
the
primitive
music
of
the
polonaise
of
which
we
have
no
example
of
greater
age
than
a

polonaises

the
memories

his
epoch

could
not

among
the
polonaises
of

oginski
the
one

has
especially
retained
its
celebrity
it
was
published
with
a
vignette
representing
the
author
in
the
act
of
blowing
his
brains
out
with
a
pistol

was
merely
a
romantic
commentary

was
for
a

mistaken
for

reveals
to

the
secrets
of

all
the
poetry
contained
in

like

in
the
number

he
not

splendor
of
glory
may
he
not

after
having
rejoiced
with

victorious
may
he
not
mourn
with
the
vanquished
we
may
without
any
fear
of
contradiction
assert
that
it
is
not
one
of
the
least
merits
of
chopin
that
he
has
consecutively
embraced
all
the
phases
of
which
the
theme
is
susceptible
that
he
has
succeeded
in
eliciting
from
it
all
its
brilliancy
in
awakening
from
it
all
its
sadness
the
variety
of
the
moods
of
feeling
to
which
he
was
himself
subject
aided
him
in
the
reproduction
and
comprehension
of
such
a
multiplicity
of
views
it
would
be
impossible
to
follow
the
varied
transformations
occurring
in
these
compositions
with
their
pervading
melancholy
without
admiring
the
fecundity
of
his
creative
force
even
when
not
fully
sustained
by
the
higher
powers
of
his
inspiration
he
did
not
always
confine
himself
to
the
consideration
of
the
pictures
presented
to
him
by
his
imagination
and
memory
taken
en
masse
or
as
a
united
whole
more
than
once
while
contemplating
the
brilliant
groups
and
throngs
flowing
on
before
him
has
he
yielded
to
the
strange
charm
of
some
isolated
figure
arresting
it
in
its
course
by
the
magic
of
his
gaze
and
suffering
the
gay
crowds
to
pass
on
he
has
given
himself
up
with
delight
to
the
divination
of
its
mystic
revelations
while
he
continued
to
weave
his
incantations
and
spells
only
for
the
entranced
sibyl
of
his
song
his
grand
polonaise
in
f
sharp
minor
must
be
ranked
among
his
most
energetic
compositions
he
has
inserted
in
it
a
mazourka
had
he
not
frightened
the
frivolous
world
of
fashionable
life
by
the
gloomy
grotesqueness
with
which
he
introduced
it
in
an
incantation
so
fantastic
this
mode
might
have
become
an
ingenious
caprice
for
the
it
is
a
most
original
production
exciting
us
like
the
recital
of
some
broken
dream
made
after
a
night
of
restlessness
by
the
first
dull
gray
cold
leaden
rays
of
a
winter
sunrise
it
is
a
in
which
the
impressions
and
objects
succeed
each
other
with
startling
incoherency
and
with
the
wildest
transitions
reminding
us
of
what
byron
says
in
his
dream
dreams
in
their
development
have
breath
and
tears
and
tortures
and
the
touch
of
joy
they
leave
a
weight
upon
our
waking
thoughts
and
look
like
heralds
of
eternity
the
principal
motive
is
a
weird
air
dark
as
the
lurid
hour
which
precedes
a
hurricane
in
which
we
catch
the
fierce
exclamations
of
exasperation
mingled
with
a
bold
defiance
recklessly
hurled
at
the
stormy
elements
the
prolonged
return
of
a
tonic
at
the
commencement
of
each
measure
reminds
us
of
the
repeated
roar
of
artillery
as
if
we
caught
the
sounds
from
some
dread
battle
waging
in
the
distance
after
the
termination
of
this
note
a
series
of
the
most
unusual
chords
are
unrolled
through
measure
after
measure
we
know
nothing
analogous
to
the
striking
effect
produced
by
this
in
the
compositions
of
the
greatest
masters
this
passage
is
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
scene
champetre
a
mazourka
in
the
style
of
an
idyl
full
of
the
perfume
of
lavender
and
sweet
marjoram
but
which
far
from
effacing
the
memory
of
the
profound
sorrow
which
had
before
been
awakened
only
augments
by
its
ironical
and
bitter
contrast
our
emotions
of
pain
to
such
a
degree
that
we
feel
almost
solaced
when
the
first
phrase
returns
and
free
from
the
disturbing
contradiction
of
a
naive
simple
and
inglorious
happiness
we
may
again
sympathize
with
the
noble
and
imposing
woe
of
a
high
yet
fatal
struggle
this
improvisation
terminates
like
a
dream
without
other
conclusion
than
a
convulsive
shudder
leaving
the
soul
under
the
strangest
the
wildest
the
most
subduing
impressions
the
is
to
be
classed
among
the
works
which
belong
to
the
latest
period
of
chopin
compositions
which
are
all
more
or
less
marked
by
a
feverish
and
restless
anxiety
no
bold
and
brilliant
pictures
are
to
be
found
in
it
the
loud
tramp
of
a
cavalry
accustomed
to
victory
is
no
longer
heard
no
more
resound
the
heroic
chants
muffled
by
no
visions
of
defeat
the
bold
tones
suited
to
the
audacity
of
those
who
were
always
victorious
a
deep
melancholy
ever
broken
by
startled
movements
by
sudden
alarms
by
disturbed
rest
by
stifled
sighs
reigns
throughout
we
are
surrounded
by
such
scenes
and
feelings
as
might
arise
among
those
who
had
been
surprised
and
encompassed
on
all
sides
by
an
ambuscade
the
vast
sweep
of
whose
horizon
reveals
not
a
single
ground
for
hope
and
whose
despair
had
giddied
the
brain
like
a
draught
of
that
wine
of
cyprus
which
gives
a
more
instinctive
rapidity
to
all
our
gestures
a
keener
point
to
all
our
words
a
more
subtle
flame
to
all
our
emotions
and
excites
the
mind
to
a
pitch
of
irritability
approaching
insanity
such
pictures
possess
but
little
real
value
for
art
like
all
descriptions
of
moments
of
extremity
of
agonies
of
death
rattles
of
contractions
of
the
muscles
where
all
elasticity
is
lost
where
the
nerves
ceasing
to
be
the
organs
of
the
human
will
reduce
man
to
a
passive
victim
of
despair
they
only
serve
to
torture
the
soul
deplorable
visions
which
the
artist
should
admit
with
extreme
circumspection
within
the
graceful
circle
of
his
charmed
realm

this
very

is
however
always
stamped
with
melancholy
both
the
music
of
the
national
airs
and
the
words
which
are
almost
always
joined
with

emotions

which
necessity
induced

to
seek
the
magical
distraction
of
the
graceful
mazourka
with
its
transient
delusions
the
words
which
were
sung
to
these
melodies
gave
them
a
capability
of
linking
themselves
with
the
sacred
associations
of
memory
in
a
far
higher
degree
than
is
usual
with
ordinary
they
were
sung
and
a
thousand
times
in
the
days
of
buoyant
youth
by
fresh
and
sonorous
voices
in
the
hours
of
solitude
or
in
those
of
happy
idleness
linking
the
most
varying
associations
with
the
melody
they
were
again
and
again
carelessly
hummed
when
traveling
through
forests
or
ploughing
the
deep
in
ships
perhaps
they
were
listlessly
upon
the
lips
when
some
startling
emotion
has
suddenly
surprised
the
singer
when
an
unexpected
meeting
a
grouping
an
word
has
thrown
an
undying
light
upon
the
heart
consecrating
hours
destined
to
live

and
ever
to
shine
on
in
the
memory
even
through
the
most
distant
and
gloomy
recesses
of
the
constantly
darkening
future
such
inspirations
were
used
by
chopin
in
the
most
happy
manner
and
greatly
enriched
with
the
treasures
of
his
handling
and
style
cutting
these
diamonds
so
as
to
present
a
thousand
facets
he
brought
all
their
latent
fire
to
light
and
even
their
glittering
dust
he
mounted
them
in
gorgeous
caskets
indeed
what
settings
could
he
have
chosen
better
adapted
to
enhance
the
value
of
his
early
recollections
or
which
would
have
given
him
more
efficient
aid
in
creating
poems
in
arranging
scenes
in
depicting
episodes
in
producing
romances
such
associations
and
national
memories
are
indebted
to
him
for
a
reign
far
more
extensive
than
the
land
which
gave
them
birth
placing
them
among
those
idealized
types
which
art
has
touched
and
consecrated
with
her
resplendent
lustre
he
has
gifted
them
with
immortality
in
order
fully
to
understand
how
perfectly
this
setting
suited
the
varying
emotions
which
chopin
had
succeeded
in
displaying
in
all
the
magic
of
their
rainbow
hues
we
must
have
seen
the
mazourka
danced
in
poland
because
it
is
only
there
that
it
is
possible
to
catch
the
haughty
yet
tender
and
alluring
character
of
this
dance
the
cavalier
always
chosen
by
the
lady
seizes
her
as
a
conquest
of
which
he
is
proud
striving
to
exhibit
her
loveliness
to
the
admiration
of
his
rivals
before
he
whirls
her
off
in
an
entrancing
and
ardent
embrace
through
the
tenderness
of
which
the
defiant
expression
of
the
victor
still
gleams
mingling
with
the
blushing
yet
gratified
vanity
of
the
prize
whose
beauty
forms
the
glory
of
his
triumph
there
are
few
more
delightful
scenes
than
a
ball
in

after

commenced

of

a
multitude

fascinated
by

of
equal
beauty
darting
forward
like
twin
stars
in

and
unimpeded
space
as
if
in
the
pride
of
defiance
the
cavalier
accentuates
his
steps
quits
his
partner
for
a
moment
as
if
to
contemplate
her
with
renewed
delight
rejoins
her
with
passionate
eagerness
or
whirls
himself
rapidly
round
as
though
overcome
with
the
sudden
joy
and
yielding
to
the
delicious
giddiness
of
rapture
sometimes
two
couples
start
at
the

moment
after

a
change
of
partners
may
occur
between

himself

turn
claimed
by
the
most
brilliant
gentlemen
present
courting
the
honor
of
leading
them
through
the
mazes
of
the
dance
while
in
the
waltz
and
galop
the
dancers
are
isolated
and
only
confused
tableaux
are
offered
to
the
bystanders
while
the
quadrille
is
only
a
kind
of
pass
at
arms
made
with
foils
where
attack
and
defence
proceed
with
equal
indifference
where
the
most
nonchalant
display
of
grace
is
answered
with
the
same
nonchalance
while
the
vivacity
of
the
polka
charming
we
confess
may
easily
become
equivocal
while
fandangos
tarantulas
and
minuets
are
merely
little
only
interesting
to
those
who
execute
them
in
which
the
cavalier
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
display
his
partner
and
the
spectators
have
no
share
but
to
follow
tediously
enough
coquetries
whose
obligatory
movements
are
not
addressed
to
them
in
the
mazourka
on
the
contrary
they
have
also
their
part
and
the
role
of
the
cavalier
yields
neither
in
grace
nor
importance
to
that
of
his
fair
partner
the
long
intervals
which
separate
the
successive
appearance
of
the
pairs
being
reserved
for
conversation
among
the
dancers
when
their
turn
comes
again
the
scene
passes
no
longer
only
among
themselves
but
extends
from
them
to
the
spectators
it
is
to
them
that
the
cavalier
exhibits
the
vanity
he
feels
in
having
been
able
to
win
the
preference
of
the
lady
who
has
selected
him
it
is
in
their
presence
she
has
deigned
to
show
him
this
honor
she
strives
to
please
them
because
the
triumph
of
charming
them
is
reflected
upon
her
partner
and
their
applause
may
be
made
a
part
of
the
most
flattering
and
insinuating
coquetry
indeed
at
the
close
of
the
dance
she
seems
to
make
him
a
formal
offering
of
their
suffrages
in
her
favor
she
bounds
rapidly
towards
him
and
rests
upon
his
arm
a
movement
susceptible
of
a
thousand
varying
shades
which
feminine
tact
and
subtle
feeling
well
know
how
to
modify
ringing
every
change
from
the
most
impassioned
and
impulsive
warmth
of
manner
to
an
air
of
the
most
complete
abandon
what
varied
movements
succeed
each
other
in
the
course
round
the
commencing
at
first
with
a
kind
of
timid
hesitation
the
lady
sways
about
like
a
bird
about
to
take
flight
gliding
for
some
time
on
one
foot
only
like
a
skater
she
skims
the
ice
of
the
polished
floor
then
running
forward
like
a
sportive
child
she
suddenly
takes
wing
raising
her
veiling
eyelids
with
head
erect
with
swelling
bosom
and
elastic
bounds
she
cleaves
the
air
as
the
light
bark
cleaves
the
waves
and
like
an
agile
woodnymph
seems
to
sport
with
space
again
she
recommences
her
timid
graceful
gliding
looks
round
among
the
spectators
sends
sighs
and
words
to
the
most
highly
favored
then
extending
her
white
arms
to
the
partner
who
comes
to
rejoin
her
again
begins
her
vigorous
steps
which
transport
her
with
magical
rapidity
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
she
glides
she
runs
she
flies
emotion
colors
her
cheek
brightens
her
eye
fatigue
bends
her
flexile
form
retards
her
winged
feet
until
panting
and
exhausted
she
softly
sinks
and
reclines
in
the
arms
of
her
partner
who
seizing
her
with
vigorous
arm
raises
her
a
moment
in
the
air
before
finishing
with
her
the
last
intoxicating
round
in
this
triumphal
course
in
which
may
be
seen
a
thousand
atalantas
as
beautiful
as
the
dreams
of
ovid
many
changes
occur
in
the
figures
the
couples
in
the
first
chain
commence
by
giving
each
other
the
hand
then
forming
themselves
into
a
circle
whose
rapid
rotation
dazzles
the
eye
they
wreathe
a
living
crown
in
which
each
lady
is
the
only
flower
of
its
own
kind
while
the
glowing
and
varied
colors
are
heightened
by
the
uniform
costume
of
the
men
the
effect
resembling
that
of
the
foliage
with
which
nature
relieves
her
glowing
buds
and
fragrant
bloom
they
all
then
dart
forward
together
with
a
sparkling
animation
a
jealous
emulation
defiling
before
the
spectators
as
in
a
review
an
enumeration
of
which
would
scarcely
yield
in
interest
to
those
given
us
by
homer
and
tasso
of
the
armies
about
to
range
themselves
in
the
front
of
battle
at
the
close
of
an
hour
or
two
the
same
circle
again
forms
to
end
the
dance
and
on
those
days
when
amusement
and
pleasure
fill
all
with
an
excited
gayety
sparkling
and
glittering
through
those
impressible
temperaments
like
an
aurora
in
a
midnight
sky
a
general
promenade
is
recommenced
and
in
its
accelerated
movements
we
can
not
detect
the
least
symptom
of
fatigue
among
all
these
delicate
yet
enduring
women
as
if
their
light
limbs
possessed
the
flexible
tenacity
and
elasticity
of
steel
as
if
by
intuition
all
the
polish
women
possess
the
magical
science
of
this
dance
even
the
least
richly
gifted
among
them
know
how
to
draw
from
it
new
charms
if
the
graceful
ease
and
noble
dignity
of
those
conscious
of
their
own
power
are
full
of
attraction
in
it
timidity
and
modesty
are
equally
full
of
interest
this
is
so
because
of
all
modern
dances
it
breathes
most
of
pure
love
as
the
dancers
are
always
conscious
that
the
gaze
of
the
spectators
is
fastened
upon
them
addressing
themselves
constantly
to
them
there
reigns
in
its
very
essence
a
mixture
of
innate
tenderness
and
mutual
vanity
as
full
of
delicacy
and
propriety
as
of
allurement
the
latent
and
unknown
poetry
which
was
only
indicated
in
the
original
polish
mazourkas
was
divined
developed
and
brought
to
light
by
chopin
preserving
their
rhythm
he
ennobled
their
melody
enlarged
their
proportions
and
in
order
to
paint
more
fully
in
these
productions
which
he
loved
to
hear
us
call
pictures
from
the
easel
the
innumerable
and
emotions
which
agitate
the
heart
during
the
progress
of
this
dance
above
all
in
the
long
intervals
in
which
the
cavalier
has
a
right
to
retain
his
place
at
the
side
of
the
lady
whom
he
never
leaves
he
wrought
into
their
tissues
harmonic
lights
and
shadows
as
new
in
themselves
as
were
the
subjects
to
which
he
adapted
them
coquetries
vanities
fantasies
inclinations
elegies
vague
emotions
passions
conquests
struggles
upon
which
the
safety
or
favor
of
others
depends
all
all
meet
in
this
dance
how
difficult
it
is
to
form
a
complete
idea
of
the
infinite
gradations
of
passion
sometimes
pausing
sometimes
progressing
sometimes
suing
sometimes
ruling
in
the
country
where
the
mazourka
reigns
from
the
palace
to
the
cottage
these
gradations
are
pursued
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
with
as
much
ardor
and
enthusiasm
as
malicious
trifling
the
good
qualities
and
faults
of
men
are
distributed
among
the
poles
in
a
manner
so
fantastic
that
although
the
essentials
of
character
may
remain
nearly
the
same
in
all
they
vary
and
shade
into
each
other
in
a
manner
so
extraordinary
that
it
becomes
almost
impossible
to
recognize
or
distinguish
them
in
natures
so
capriciously
amalgamated
a
wonderful
diversity
occurs
adding
to
the
investigations
of
curiosity
a
spur
unknown
in
other
lands
making
of
every
new
relation
a
stimulating
study
and
lending
unwonted
interest
to
the
lightest
incident
nothing
is
here
indifferent
nothing
unheeded
nothing
hackneyed
striking
contrasts
are
constantly
occurring
among
these
natures
so
mobile
and
susceptible
endowed
with
subtle
keen
and
vivid
intellects
with
acute
sensibilities
increased
by
suffering
and
misfortune
contrasts
throwing
lurid
light
upon
hearts
like
the
blaze
of
a
conflagration
illumining
and
revealing
the
gloom
of
midnight
here
chance
may
bring
together
those
who
but
a
few
hours
before
were
strangers
to
each
other
the
ordeal
of
a
moment
a
single
word
may
separate
hearts
long
united
sudden
confidences
are
often
forced
by
necessity
and
invincible
suspicions
frequently
held
in
secret
as
a
witty
woman
once
remarked
they
often
play
a
comedy
to
avoid
a
tragedy
that
which
has
never
been
uttered
is
yet
incessantly
divined
and
understood
generalities
are
often
used
to
sharpen
interrogation
while
concealing
its
drift
the
most
evasive
replies
are
carefully
listened
to
like
the
ringing
of
metal
as
a
test
of
the
quality
often
when
in
appearance
pleading
for
others
the
suitor
is
urging
his
own
cause
and
the
most
graceful
flattery
may
be
only
the
veil
of
disguised
exactions
but
caution
and
attention
become
at
last
wearisome
to
natures
naturally
expansive
and
candid
and
a
tiresome
frivolity
surprising
enough
before
the
secret
of
its
reckless
indifference
has
been
divined
mingles
with
the
most
spiritual
refinement
the
most
poetic
sentiments
the
most
real
causes
for
intense
suffering
as
if
to
mock
and
jeer
at
all
reality
it
is
difficult
to
analyze
or
appreciate
justly
this
frivolity
as
it
is
sometimes
real
sometimes
only
assumed
it
makes
use
of
confusing
replies
and
strange
resources
to
conceal
the
truth
it
is
sometimes
justly
sometimes
wrongfully
regarded
as
a
kind
of
veil
of
motley
whose
fantastic
tissue
needs
only
to
be
slightly
torn
to
reveal
more
than
one
hidden
or
sleeping
quality
under
the
variegated
folds
of
gossamer
it
often
follows
from
such
causes
that
eloquence
becomes
only
a
sort
of
grave
badinage
sparkling
with
spangles
like
the
play
of
fireworks
though
the
heart
of
the
discourse
may
contain
nothing
earnest
while
the
lightest
raillery
thrown
out
apparently
at
random
may
perhaps
be
most
sadly
serious
bitter
and
intense
thought
follows
closely
upon
the
steps
of
the
most
tempestuous
gayety
nothing
indeed
remains
absolutely
superficial
though
nothing
is
presented
without
an
artificial
polish
in
the
discussions
constantly
occurring
in
this
country
where
conversation
is
an
art
cultivated
to
the
highest
degree
and
occupying
much
time
there
are
always
those
present
who
whether
the
topic
discussed
be
grave
or
gay
can
pass
in
a
moment
from
smiles
to
tears
from
joy
to
sorrow
leaving
the
keenest
observer
in
doubt
which
is
most
real
so
difficult
is
it
to
discern
the
fictitious
from
the
true
in
such
varying
modes
of
thought
where
ideas
shift
like
quick
sands
upon
the
shores
of
the
sea
they
are
rarely
to
be
found
again
at
the
exact
point
where
they
were
left
this
fact
is
in
itself
sufficient
to
give
interest
to
interviews
otherwise
insignificant
we
have
been
taught
this
in
paris
by
some
natives
of
poland
who
astonished
the
parisians
by
their
skill
in
fencing
in
paradox
an
art
in
which
every
pole
is
more
or
less
skillful
as
he
has
felt
more
or
less
interest
or
amusement
in
its
cultivation
but
the
inimitable
skill
with
which
they
are
constantly
able
to
alternate
the
garb
of
truth
or
fiction
like
touchstones
more
certain
when
least
suspected
the
one
always
concealed
under
the
garb
of
the
other
the
force
which
expends
an
immense
amount
of
intellect
upon
the
most
trivial
occasions
as
gil
bias
made
use
of
as
much
intelligence
to
find
the
means
of
subsistence
for
a
single
day
as
was
required
by
the
spanish
king
to
govern
the
whole
of
his
domain
make
at
last
an
impression
as
painful
upon
us
as
the
games
in
which
the
jugglers
of
india
exhibit
such
wonderful
skill
where
sharp
and
deadly
arms
fly
glittering
through
the
air
which
the
least
error
the
least
want
of
perfect
mastery
would
make
the
bright
swift
messengers
of
certain
death
such
skill
is
full
of
concealed
anxiety
terror
and
anguish
from
the
complication
of
circumstances
danger
may
lurk
in
the
slightest
inadvertence
in
the
least
imprudence
in
possible
accidents
while
powerful
assistance
may
suddenly
spring
from
some
obscure
and
forgotten
individual
a
dramatic
interest
may
instantaneously
arise
from
interviews
apparently
the
most
trivial
giving
an
unforeseen
phase
to
every
relation
a
misty
uncertainty
hovers
round
every
meeting
through
whose
clouds
it
is
difficult
to
seize
the
contours
to
fix
the
lines
to
ascertain
the
present
and
future
influence
thus
rendering
intercourse
vague
and
unintelligible
filling
it
with
an
indefinable
and
hidden
terror
yet
at
the
same
time
with
an
insinuating
flattery
the
strong
currents
of
genuine
sympathy
are
always
struggling
to
escape
from
the
weight
of
this
external
repression
the
differing
impulses
of
vanity
love
and
patriotism
in
their
threefold
motives
of
action
are
forever
hurtling
against
each
other
in
all
hearts
leading
to
inextricable
confusion
of
thought
and
feeling
what
mingling
emotions
are
concentrated
in
the
accidental
meetings
of
the
mazourka
it
can
surround
with
its
own
enchantment
the
lightest
emotion
of
the
heart
while
through
its
magic
the
most
reserved
transitory
and
trivial
rencounter
appeals
to
the
imagination
could
it
be
otherwise
in
the
presence
of
the
women
who
give
to
this
dance
that
inimitable
grace
and
suavity
for
which
in
less
happy
countries
they
struggle
in
vain
in
very
truth
are
not
the
sclavic
women
utterly
incomparable
there
are
to
be
found
among
them
those
whose
qualities
and
virtues
are
so
incontestable
so
absolute
that
they
are
acknowledged
by
all
ages
and
by
all
countries
such
apparitions
are
always
and
everywhere
rare
the
women
of
poland
are
generally
distinguished
by
an
originality
full
of
fire
parisians
in
their
grace
and
culture
eastern
dancing
girls
in
their
languid
fire
they
have
perhaps
preserved
among
them
handed
down
from
mother
to
daughter
the
secret
of
the
burning
love
potions
possessed
in
the
seraglios
their
charms
possess
the
strange
spell
of
asiatic
languor
with
the
flames
of
spiritual
and
intellectual
houris
in
their
lustrous
eyes
we
find
the
luxurious
indolence
of
the
sultana
their
manners
caress
without
emboldening
the
grace
of
their
languid
movements
is
intoxicating
they
allure
by
a
flexibility
of
form
which
knows
no
restraint
save
that
of
perfect
modesty
and
which
etiquette
has
never
succeeded
in
robbing
of
its
willowy
grace
they
win
upon
us
by
those
intonations
of
voice
which
touch
the
heart
and
fill
the
eye
with
tender
tears
by
those
sudden
and
graceful
impulses
which
recall
the
spontaneity
and
beautiful
timidity
of
the
gazelle
intelligent
cultivated
comprehending
every
thing
with
rapidity
skillful
in
the
use
of
all
they
have
acquired
they
are
nevertheless
as
superstitious
and
fastidious
as
the
lovely
yet
ignorant
creatures
adored
by
the
arabian
prophet
generous
devout
loving
danger
and
loving
love
from
which
they
demand
much
and
to
which
they
grant
little
beyond
every
thing
they
prize
renown
and
glory
all
heroism
is
dear
to
them
perhaps
there
is
no
one
among
them
who
would
think
it
possible
to
pay
too
dearly
for
a
brilliant
action
and
yet
let
us
say
it
with
reverence
many
of
them
devote
to
obscurity
their
most
holy
sacrifices
their
most
sublime
virtues
but
however
exemplary
these
quiet
virtues
of
the
home
life
may
be
neither
the
miseries
of
private
life
nor
the
secret
sorrows
which
must
prey
upon
souls
too
ardent
not
to
be
frequently
wounded
can
diminish
the
wonderful
vivacity
of
their
emotions
which
they
know
how
to
communicate
with
the
infallible
rapidity
and
certainty
of
an
electric
spark
discreet
by
nature
and
position
they
manage
the
great
weapon
of
dissimulation
with
incredible
dexterity
skillfully
reading
the
souls
of
others
with
out
revealing
the
secrets
of
their
own
with
that
strange
pride
which
disdains
to
exhibit
characteristic
or
individual
qualities
it
is
frequently
the
most
noble
virtues
which
are
thus
concealed
the
internal
contempt
they
feel
for
those
who
can
not
divine
them
gives
them
that
superiority
which
enables
them
to
reign
so
absolutely
over
those
whom
they
have
enthralled
flattered
subjugated
charmed
until
the
moment
arrives
when
loving
with
the
whole
force
of
their
ardent
souls
they
are
willing
to
brave
and
share
the
most
bitter
suffering
prison
exile
even
death
itself
with
the
object
of
their
love
ever
faithful
ever
consoling
ever
tender
ever
unchangeable
in
the
intensity
of
their
generous
devotion
irresistible
beings
who
in
fascinating

an
earnest

devout
esteem

precious

by
the
polish
women
is
always
fervent
they
all
possess
the
poetic
conception
of
an
ideal
which
gleams
through
their
intercourse
like
an
image
constantly
passing
before
a
mirror
the
comprehension
and
seizure
of
which
they
impose
as
a
task
despising
the
insipid
and
common
pleasure
of
merely
being
able
to
please
they
demand
that
the
being
whom
they
love
shall
be
capable
of
exacting
their
esteem
this
romantic
temperament
sometimes
retains
them
long
in
hesitation
between
the
world
and
the
cloister
indeed
there
are
few
among
them
who
at
some
moment
of
their
lives
have
not
seriously
and
bitterly
thought
of
taking
refuge
within
the
walls
of
a
convent
where
such
women
reign
as
sovereigns
what
feverish
words
what
hopes
what
despair
what
entrancing
fascinations
must
occur
in
the
mazes
of
the
mazourka
the
mazourka
whose
every
cadence
vibrates
in
the
ear
of
the
polish
lady
as
the
echo
of
a
vanished
passion
or
the
whisper
of
a
tender
declaration
which
among
them
has
ever
danced
through
a
mazourka
whose
cheeks
burned
not
more
from
the
excitement
of
emotion
than
from
mere
physical
fatigue
what
unexpected
and
endearing
ties
have
been
formed
in
the
long
in
the
very
midst
of
crowds
with
the
sounds
of
music
which
generally
recalled
the
name
of
some
hero
or
some
proud
historical
remembrance
attached
to
the
words
floating
around
while
thus
the
associations
of
love
and
heroism
became
forever
attached
to
the
words
and
melodies
what
ardent
vows
have
been
exchanged
what
wild
and
despairing
farewells
been
breathed
how
many
brief
attachments
have
been
linked
and
as
suddenly
unlinked
between
those
who
had
never
met
before
who
were
never
never
to
meet
again
and
yet
to
whom
forgetfulness
had
become
forever
impossible
what
hopeless
love
may
have
been
revealed
during
the
moments
so
rare
upon
this
earth
when
beauty
is
more
highly
esteemed
than
riches
a
noble
bearing
of
more
consequence
than
rank
what
dark
destinies
forever
severed
by
the
tyranny
of
rank
and
wealth
may
have
been
in
these
fleeting
moments
of
meeting
again
united
happy
in
the
glitter
of
passing
triumph
reveling
in
concealed
and
unsuspected
joy
what
interviews
commenced
in
indifference
prolonged
in
jest
interrupted
with
emotion
renewed
with
the
secret
consciousness
of
mutual
understanding
in
all
that
concerns
subtle
intuition
slavic
finesse
and
delicacy
especially
excel
have
terminated
in
the
deepest
attachments
what
holy
confidences
have
been
exchanged
in
the
spirit
of
that
generous
frankness
which
circulates
from
unknown
to
unknown
when
the
noble
are
delivered
from
the
tyranny
of
forced
conventionalisms
what
words
deceitfully
bland
what
vows
what
desires
what
vague
hopes
have
been
negligently
thrown
on
the
winds
thrown
as
the
handkerchief
of
the
fair
dancer
in
the
mazourka
and
which
the
maladroit
knows
not
how
to
pick
up
we
have
before
asserted
that
we
must
have
known
personally
the
women
of
poland
for
the
full
and
intuitive
comprehension
of
the
feelings
with
which
the
mazourkas
of
chopin
as
well
as
many
more
of
his
compositions
are
impregnated
a
subtle
love
vapor
floats
like
an
ambient
fluid
around
them
we
may
trace
step
by
step
in
his
preludes
nocturnes
impromptus
and
mazourkas
all
the
phases
of
which
passion
is
capable
the
sportive
hues
of
coquetry
the
insensible
and
gradual
yielding
of
inclination
the
capricious
festoons
of
fantasy
the
sadness
of
sickly
joys
born
dying
flowers
of
mourning
like
the
black
roses
the
very
perfume
of
whose
gloomy
leaves
is
depressing
and
whose
petals
are
so
frail
that
the
faintest
sigh
is
sufficient
to
detach
them
from
the
fragile
stem
sudden
flames
without
thought
like
the
false
shining
of
that
decayed
and
dead
wood
which
only
glitters
in
obscurity
and
crumbles
at
the
touch
pleasures
without
past
and
without
future
snatched
from
accidental
meetings
illusions
inexplicable
excitements
tempting
to
adventure
like
the
sharp
taste
of
half
ripened
fruit
which
stimulates
and
pleases
even
while
it
sets
the
teeth
on
edge
emotions
without
memory
and
without
hope
shadowy
feelings
whose
chromatic
tints
are
interminable
are
all
found
in
these
works
endowed
by
genius
with
the
innate
nobility
the
beauty
the
distinction
the
surpassing
elegance
of
those
by
whom
they
are
experienced
in
the
compositions
just
mentioned
as
well
as
in
most
of
his
ballads
waltzes
and
etudes
the
rendering
of
some
of
the
poetical
subjects
to
which
we
have
just
alluded
may
be
found
embalmed
these
fugitive
poems
are
so
idealized
rendered
so
fragile
and
attenuated
that
they
scarcely
seem
to
belong
to
human
nature
but
rather
to
a
fairy
world
unveiling
the
indiscreet
confidences
of
peris
of
titanias
of
ariels
of
queen
mabs
of
the
genii
of
the
air
of
water
and
of
fire
like
ourselves
subject
to
bitter
disappointments
to
invincible
disgusts
some
of
these
compositions
are
as
gay
and
fantastic
as
the
wiles
of
an
enamored
yet
mischievous
sylph
some
are
soft
playing
in
undulating
light
like
the
hues
of
a
salamander
some
full
of
the
most
profound
discouragement
as
if
the
sighs
of
souls
in
pain
who
could
find
none
to
offer
up
the
charitable
prayers
necessary
for
their
deliverance
breathed
through
their
notes
sometimes
a
despair
so
inconsolable
is
stamped
upon
them
that
we
feel
ourselves
present
at
some
byronic
tragedy
oppressed
by
the
anguish
of
a
jacopo
foscari
unable
to
survive
the
agony
of
exile
in
some
we
hear
the
shuddering
spasms
of
suppressed
sobs
some
of
them
in
which
the
black
keys
are
exclusively
taken
are
acute
and
subtle
and
remind
us
of
the
character
of
his
own
gaiety
lover
of
atticism
as
he
was
subject
only
to
the
higher
emotions
recoiling
from
all
vulgar
mirth
from
coarse
laughter
and
from
low
enjoyments
as
we
do
from
those
animals
more
abject
than
venomous
whose
very
sight
causes
the
most
nauseating
repulsion
in
tender
and
sensitive
natures
an
exceeding
variety
of
subjects
and
impressions
occur
in
the
great
number
of
his
mazourkas
sometimes
we
catch
the
manly
sounds
of
the
rattling
of
spurs
but
it
is
generally
the
almost
imperceptible
rustling
of
crape
and
gauze
under
the
light
breath
of
the
dancers
or
the
clinking
of
chains
of
gold
and
diamonds
that
maybe
distinguished
some
of
them
seem
to
depict
the
defiant
pleasure
of
the
ball
given
on
the
eve
of
battle
tortured
however
by
anxiety
for
through
the
rhythm
of
the
dance
we
hear
the
sighs
and
despairing
farewells
of
hearts
forced
to
suppress
their
tears
others
reveal
to
us
the
discomfort
and
secret
ennui
of
those
guests
at
a
fete
who
find
it
in
vain
to
expect
that
the
gay
sounds
will
muffle
the
sharp
cries
of
anguished
spirits
we
sometimes
catch
the
gasping
breath
of
terror
and
stifled
fears
sometimes
divine
the
dim
presentiments
of
a
love
destined
to
perpetual
struggle
and
doomed
to
survive
all
hope
which
though
devoured
by
jealousy
and
conscious
that
it
can
never
be
the
victor
still
disdains
to
curse
and
takes
refuge
in
a
pity
in
others
we
feel
as
if
borne
into
the
heart
of
a
whirlwind
a
strange
madness
in
the
midst
of
the
mystic
confusion
an
abrupt
melody
passes
and
repasses
panting
and
palpitating
like
the
throbbing
of
a
heart
faint
with
longing
gasping
in
despair
breaking
in
anguish
dying
of
hopeless
yet
indignant
love
in
some
we
hear
the
distant
flourish
of
trumpets
like
fading
memories
of
glories
past
in
some
of
them
the
rhythm
is
as
floating
as
undetermined
as
shadowy
as
the
feeling
with
which
two
young
lovers
gaze
upon
the
first
star
of
evening
as
yet
alone
in
the
dim
skies
upon
one
afternoon
when
there
were
but
three
persons
present
and
chopin
had
been
playing
for
a
long
time
one
of
the
most
distinguished
women
in
paris
remarked
that
she
felt
always
more
and
more
filled
with
solemn
meditation
such
as
might
be
awakened
in
presence
of
the
strewing
those
grounds
in
turkey
whose
shady
recesses
and
bright
beds
of
flowers
promise
only
a
gay
garden
to
the
startled
traveller
she
asked
him
what
was
the
cause
of
the
involuntary
yet
sad
veneration
which
subdued
her
heart
while
listening
to
these
pieces
apparently
presenting
only
sweet
and
graceful
subjects
and
by
what
name
he
called
the
strange
emotion
inclosed
in
his
compositions
like
ashes
of
the
unknown
dead
in
superbly
sculptured
urns
of
the
purest
alabaster
conquered
by
the
appealing
tears
which
moistened
the
beautiful
eyes
with
a
candor
rare
indeed
in
this
artist
so
susceptible
upon
all
that
related
to
the
secrets
of
the
sacred
relics
buried
in
the
gorgeous
shrines
of
his
music
he
replied
that
her
heart
had
not
deceived
her
in
the
gloom
which
she
felt
stealing
upon
her
for
whatever
might
have
been
his
transitory
pleasures
he
had
never
been
free
from
a
feeling
which
might
almost
be
said
to
form
the
soil
of
his
heart
and
for
which
he
could
find
no
appropriate
expression
except
in
his
own
language
no
other
possessing
a
term
equivalent
to
the
polish
word
zal
as
if
his
ear
thirsted
for
the
sound
of
this
word
which
expresses
the
whole
range
of
emotions
produced
by
an
intense
regret
through
all
the
shades
of
feeling
from
hatred
to
repentance
he
repeated
it
again
and
again
zal
strange
substantive
embracing
a
strange
diversity
a
strange
philosophy
susceptible
of
different
regimens

includes
all
the
tenderness
all
the
humility
of
a
regret
borne
with
resignation
and
without
a
murmur
while
bowing
before
the
fiat
of
necessity
the
inscrutable
decrees
of
providence

changing
its
character
and

soon
as
it
is
addressed

ceasing
to
threaten

retaliation

ever
become

itself

bitter

sterile
hatred

of

wrought

elaborate
tissue

silver
sometimes
coloring
them
with
more
passionate
hues

be
found

sweetest
reveries

an
artist
who
has
since
been
frequently
heard
i
am
not
suited
for
concert
giving
the
public
intimidate
me
their
looks
only
stimulated
by
curiosity
paralyze
me
their
strange
faces
oppress
me
their
breath
stifles
me
but
you
you
are
destined
for
it
for
when
you
do
not
gain
your
public
you
have
the
force
to
assault
to
overwhelm
to
control
to
compel
them
conscious
of
how
much
was
necessary
for
the
comprehension
of
his
peculiar
talent
he
played
but
rarely
in
public
with
the
exception
of
some
concerts
given
at
his
debut
in
in
vienna
and
munich
he
gave
no
more
except
in
paris
being
indeed
not
able
to
travel
on
account
of
his
health
which
was
so
precarious
that
during
entire
months
he
would
appear
to
be
in
an
almost
dying
state
during
the
only
excursion
which
he
made
with
a
hope
that
the
mildness
of
a
southern
climate
would
be
more
conducive
to
his
health
his
condition
was
frequently
so
alarming
that
more
than
once
the
hotel
keepers
demanded
payment
for
the
bed
and
mattress
he
occupied
in
order
to
have
them
burned
deeming
him
already
arrived
at
that
stage
of
consumption
in
which
it
becomes
so
highly
contagious
we
believe
however
if
we
may
be
permitted
to
say
it
that
his
concerts
were
less
fatiguing
to
his
physical
constitution
than
to
his
artistic
susceptibility
we
think
that
his
voluntary
abnegation
of
popular
applause
veiled
an
internal
wound
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
his
own
superiority
perhaps
it
did
not
receive
sufficient
reverberation
and
echo
from
without
to
give
him
the
tranquil
assurance
that
he
was
perfectly
appreciated
no
doubt
in
the
absence
of
popular
acclamation
he
asked
himself
how
far
a
chosen
audience
through
the
enthusiasm
of
its
applause
was
able
to
replace
the
great
public
which
he
relinquished
few
understood
him
did
those
few
indeed
understand
him
aright
a
gnawing
feeling
of
discontent
of
which
he
himself
scarcely
comprehended
the
cause
secretly
undermined
him
we
have
seen
him
almost
shocked
by
eulogy
the
praise
to
which
he
was
justly
entitled
not
reaching
him
en
masse
he
looked
upon
isolated
commendation
as
almost
wounding
that
he
felt
himself
not
only
slightly
but
badly
applauded
was
sufficiently
evident
by
the
polished
phrases
with
which
like
troublesome
dust
he
shook
such
praises
off
making
it
quite
evident
that
he
preferred
to
be
left
undisturbed
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
solitary
feelings
to
injudicious
commendation
too
fine
a
connoisseur
in
raillery
too
ingenious
satirist
ever
to
expose
himself
to
sarcasm
he
never
assumed
the
role
of
a
genius
misunderstood
with
a
good
grace
and
under
an
apparent
satisfaction
he
concealed
so
entirely
the
wound
given
to
his
just
pride
that
its
very
existence
was
scarcely
suspected
but
not
without
reason
might
the
gradually
increasing
rarity
footnote
sometimes
he
passed
years
without
giving
a
single
concert
we
believe
the
one
given
by
him
in
room
in
was
after
an
interval
of
nearly
ten
years
of
his
concerts
be
attributed
rather
to
the
wish
he
felt
to
avoid
occasions
which
did
not
bring
him
the
tribute
he
merited
than
to
physical
debility
indeed
he
put
his
strength
to
rude
proofs
in
the
many
lessons
which
he
always
gave
and
the
many
hours
he
spent
at
his
own
piano
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
indubitable
advantage
for
the
artist
resulting
from
the
cultivation
of
only
a
select
audience
should
be
so
sensibly
diminished
by
the
rare
and
cold
expression
of
its
sympathies
the
glace
which
covers
the
grace
of
the
elite
as
it
does
the
fruit
of
their
desserts
the
imperturbable
calm
of
their
most
earnest
enthusiasm
could
not
be
satisfactory
to
chopin
the
poet
torn
from
his
solitary
inspiration
can
only
find
it
again
in
the
interest
more
than
attentive
vivid
and
animated
of
his
audience
he
can
never
hope
to
regain
it
in
the
cold
looks
of
an
areopagus
assembled
to
judge
him
he
must
feel
that
he
moves
that
he
agitates
those
who
hear
him
that
his
emotions
find
in
them
the
responsive
sympathies
of
the
same
intuitions
that
he
draws
them
on
with
him
in
his
flight
towards
the
infinite
as
when
the
leader
of
a
winged
train
gives
the
signal
of
departure
he
is
immediately
followed
by
the
whole
flock
in
search
of
milder
shores
but
had
it
been
otherwise
had
chopin
everywhere
received
the
exalted
homage
and
admiration
he
so
well
deserved
had
he
been
heard
as
so
many
others
by
all
nations
and
in
all
climates
had
ho
obtained
those
brilliant
ovations
which
make
a
capitol
every
where
where
the
people
salute
merit
or
honor
genius
had
he
been
known
and
recognized
by
thousands
in
place
of
the
hundreds
who
acknowledged
him
we
would
not
pause
in
this
part
of
his
career
to
enumerate
such
triumphs
what
are
the
dying
bouquets
of
an
hour
to
those
whose
brows
claim
the
laurel
of
immortality
ephemeral
sympathies
transitory
praises
are
not
to
be
mentioned
in
the
presence
of
the
august
dead
crowned
with
higher
glories
the
joys
the
consolations
the
soothing
emotions
which
the
creations
of
true
art
awaken
in
the
weary
suffering
thirsty
or
persevering
and
believing
hearts
to
whom
they
are
dedicated
are
destined
to
be
borne
into
far
countries
and
distant
years
by
the
sacred
works
of
chopin
thus
an
unbroken
bond
will
be
established
between
elevated
natures
enabling
them
to
understand
and
appreciate
each
other
in
whatever
part
of
the
earth
or
period
of
time
they
may
live
such
natures
are
generally
badly
divined
by
their
contemporaries
when
they
have
been
silent
often
misunderstood
when
they
have
spoken
the
most
eloquently
there
are
different
crowns
says
goethe
there
are
some
which
may
be
readily
gathered
during
a
walk
such
crowns
charm
for
the
moment
through
their
balmy
freshness
but
who
would
think
of
comparing
them
with
those
so
laboriously
gained
by
chopin
by
constant
and
exemplary
effort
by
an
earnest
love
of
art
and
by
his
own
mournful
experience
of
the
emotions
which
he
has
so
truthfully
depicted
as
he
sought
not
with
a
mean
avidity
those
crowns
so
easily
won
of
which
more
than
one
among
ourselves
has
the
modesty
to
be
proud
as
he
was
a
pure
generous
good
and
compassionate
man
filled
with
a
single
sentiment
and
that
one
of
the
most
noble
of
feelings
the
love
of
country
as
he
moved
among
us
like
a
spirit
consecrated
by
all
that
poland
possesses
of
poetry
let
us
approach
his
sacred
grave
with
due
reverence
let
us
adorn
it
with
no
artificial
wreaths
let
us
cast
upon
it
no
trivial
crowns
let
us
nobly
elevate
our
thoughts
before
this
consecrated
shroud
let
us
learn
from
him
to
repulse
all
but
the
highest
ambition
let
us
try
to
concentrate
our
labor
upon
efforts
which
will
leave
more
lasting
effects
than
the
vain
leading
of
the
fashions
of
the
passing
hour
let
us
renounce
the
corrupt
spirit
of
the
times
in
which
we
live
with
all
that
is
not
worthy
of
art
all
that
will
not
endure
all
that
does
not
contain
in
itself
some
spark
of
that
eternal
and
immaterial
beauty
which
it
is
the
task
of
art
to
reveal
and
unveil
as
the
condition
of
its
own
glory
let
us
remember
the
ancient
prayer
of
the
dorians
whose
simple
formula
is
so
full
of
pious
poetry
asking
only
of
their
gods
to
give
them
the
good
in
return
for
the
beautiful
in
place
of
laboring
so
constantly
to
attract
auditors
and
striving
to
please
them
at
whatever
sacrifice
let
us
rather
aim
like
chopin
to
leave
a
celestial
and
immortal
echo
of
what
we
have
felt
loved
and
suffered
let
us
learn
from
his
revered
memory
to
demand
from
ourselves
works
which
will
entitle
us
to
some
true
rank
in
the
sacred
city
of
art
let
us
not
exact
from
the
present
with
out
regard
to
the
future
those
light
and
vain
wreath
which
are
scarcely
woven
before
they
are
faded
and
forgotten
in
place
of
such
crowns
the
most
glorious
palms
which
it
is
possible
for
an
artist
to
receive
during
his
lifetime
have
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
chopin
by
illustrious
equals
an
enthusiastic
admiration
was
given
him
by
a
public
still
more
limited
than
the
musical
aristocracy
which
frequented
his
concerts
this
public
was
formed
of
the
most
distinguished
names
of
men
who
bowed
before
him
as
the
kings
of
different
empires
bend
before
a
monarch
whom
they
have
assembled
to
honor
such
men
rendered
to
him
individually
due
homage
how
could
it
have
been
otherwise
in
france
where
the
hospitality
so
truly
national
discerns
with
such
perfect
taste
the
rank
and
claims
of
the
guests
the
most
eminent
minds
in
paris
frequently
met
in
chopin
saloon
not
in
reunions
of
fantastic
periodicity
such
as
the
dull
imaginations
of
ceremonious
and
tiresome
circles
have
arranged
and
which
they
have
never
succeeded
in
realizing
in
accordance
with
their
wishes
for
enjoyment
ease
enthusiasm
animation
never
come
at
an
hour
fixed
upon
before
hand
they
can
be
commanded
less
by
artists
than
by
other
men
for
they
are
all
more
or
less
struck
by
some
sacred
malady
whose
paralyzing
torpor
they
must
shake
off
whose
benumbing
pain
they
must
forget
to
be
joyous
and
amused
by
those
pyrotechnic
fires
which
startle
the
bewildered
guests
who
see
from
time
to
time
a
roman
candle
a
bengal
light
a
cascade
whose
waters
are
of
fire
or
a
terrible
yet
quite
innocent
dragon
gayety
and
the
strength
necessary
to
be
joyous
are
unfortunately
things
only
accidentally
to
be
encountered
among
poets
and
artists
it
is
true
some
of
the
more
privileged
among
them
have
the
happy
gift
of
surmounting
internal
pain
so
as
to
bear
their
burden
always
lightly
able
to
laugh
with
their
companions
over
the
toils
of
the
way
or
at
least
always
able
to
preserve
a
gentle
and
calm
serenity
which
like
a
mute
pledge
of
hope
and
consolation
animates
elevates
and
encourages
their
associates
imparting
to
them
while
they
remain
under
the
influence
of
this
placid
atmosphere
a
freedom
of
spirit
which
appears
so
much
the
more
vivid
the
more
strongly
it
contrasts
with
their
habitual
ennui
their
abstraction
their
natural
gloom
their
usual
indifference
chopin
did
not
belong
to
either
of
the
above
mentioned
classes
he
possessed
the
innate
grace
of
a
polish
welcome
by
which
the
host
is
not
only
bound
to
fulfill
the
common
laws
and
duties
of
hospitality
but
is
obliged
to
relinquish
all
thought
of
himself
to
devote
all
his
powers
to
promote
the
enjoyment
of
his
guests
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
visit
him
his
visitors
were
always
charmed
he
knew
how
to
put
them
at
once
at
ease
making
them
masters
of
every
thing
and
placing
every
thing
at
their
disposal
in
doing
the
honors
of
his
own
cabin
even
the
simple
laborer
of
sclavic
race
never
departs
from
this
munificence
more
joyously
eager
in
his
welcome
than
the
arab
in
his
tent
he
compensates
for
the
splendor
which
may
be
wanting
in
his
reception
by
an
adage
which
he
never
fails
to
repeat

be
readily

entire
freedom

were
of
a
character
so
pure
that
no
insipidity
or
bitterness
ever
ensued
no
ill
humor
was
ever
provoked
though
he
avoided
society

when
his

kindness

his
attention
was
delightful

appearing

occupy
himself

succeeded

all
that

extended

it
was
not
without
a
struggle
without
a
repugnance
slightly
misanthropic
that
chopin
could
be
induced
to
open
his
doors

piano
even
to
those
whose
friendship
as
respectful
as
faithful
gave
them
a
claim
to
urge
such
a
request
with
eagerness
without
doubt
more
than
one
of
us
can
still
remember
our
first
improvised
evening
with
him
in
spite
of
his
refusal
when
he
lived
at
chaussee
his
apartment
invaded
by
surprise
was
only
lighted
by
some
wax
candles
grouped
round
one
of
pleyel
pianos
which
he
particularly
liked
for
their
slightly
veiled
yet
silvery
sonorousness
and
easy
touch
permitting
him
to
elicit
tones
which
one
might
think
proceeded
from
one
of
those
harmonicas

romantic

has
preserved
the

ingeniously

its

the
union

crystal

the

were
left

all
idea

lost
so
that
there
seemed
no
boundary

the
darkness

some
tall
piece

would
reveal
itself
in
the
dim

an
indistinct

raising
itself
like
a

listen
to
the
sounds
which
had
evoked
it
the
light
concentrated
round
the

and
falling
on
the
floor
glided
on
like
a
spreading
wave
until
it
mingled
with
the
broken
flashes

orange

rose

coquetry

familiar

ship
with
his
crew
eternally
driven
about
upon
the

sighing
in
vain
for

of

we

rather

poor

heine
well
knew
what
poor
van
der
decken
had
suffered
in
his
terrible
and
eternal
course
upon
the
ocean
which
had
fastened
its
fangs
in
the
wood
of
his
incorruptible
vessel
and
by
an
invisible
anchor
whose
chain
he
could
not
break
because
it
could
never
be
found
held
it
firmly
linked
upon
the
waves
of
its
restless
bosom
he
could
describe
to
us
when
he
chose
the
hope
the
despair
the
torture
of
the
miserable
beings
peopling
this
unfortunate
ship
for
he
had
mounted
its
accursed
timbers
led
on
and
guided
by
the
hand
of
some
enamored
undine
who
when
the
guest
of
her
forest
of
coral
and
palace
of
pearl
rose
more
morose
more
satirical
more
bitter
than
usual
offered
for
the
amusement
of
his
ill
humor
between
the
repasts
some
spectacle
worthy
of
a
lover
who
could
create
more
wonders
in
his
dreams
than
her
whole
kingdom
contained
heine
had
traveled
round
the
poles
of
the
earth
in
this
imperishable
vessel
he
had
seen
the
brilliant
visitor
of
the
long
nights
the
aurora
borealis
mirror
herself
in
the
immense
stalactites
of
eternal
ice
rejoicing
in
the
play
of
colors
alternating
with
each
other
in
the
varying
folds
of
her
glowing
scarf
he
had
visited
the
tropics
where
the
zodiacal
triangle
with
its
celestial
light
replaces
during
the
short
nights
the
burning
rays
of
an
oppressive
sun
he
had
crossed
the
latitudes
where
life
becomes
pain
and
advanced
into
those
in
which
it
is
a
living
death
making
himself
familiar
on
the
long
way
with
the
heavenly
miracles
in
the
wild
path
of
sailors
who
make
for
no
port
seated
on
a
poop
without
a
helm
his
eye
had
ranged
from
the
two
bears
majestically
overhanging
the
north
to
the
brilliant
southern
cross
through
the
blank
antarctic
deserts
extending
through
the
empty
space
of
the
heavens
overhead
as
well
as
over
the
dreary
waves
below
where
the
despairing
eye
finds
nothing
to
contemplate
in
the
sombre
depths
of
a
sky
without
a
star
vainly
arching
over
a
shoreless
and
bottomless
sea
he
had
long
followed
the
glittering
yet
fleeting
traces
left
by
the
meteors
through
the
blue
depths
of
space
he
had
tracked
the
mystic
and
incalculable
orbits
of
the
comets
as
they
flash
through
their
wandering
paths
solitary
and
incomprehensible
everywhere
dreaded
for
their
ominous
splendor
yet
inoffensive
and
harmless
he
had
gazed
upon
the
shining
of
that
distant
star
aldebaran
which
like
the
glitter
and
sullen
glow
in
the
eye
of
a
vengeful
enemy
glares
fiercely
upon
our
globe
without
daring
to
approach
it
he
had
watched
the
radiant
planets
shedding
upon
the
restless
eye
which
seeks
them
a
consoling
and
friendly
light
like
the
weird
cabala
of
an
enigmatic
yet
hopeful
promise
heine
had
seen
all
these
things
under
the
varying
appearances
which
they
assume
in
different
latitudes
he
had
seen
much
more
also
with
which
he
would
entertain
us
under
strange
similitudes
he
had
assisted
at
the
furious
cavalcade
of
herodiade
he
had
also
an
entrance
at
the
court
of
the
king
of
aulnes
in
the
gardens
of
the
hesperides
and
indeed
into
all
those
places
inaccessible
to
mortals
who
have
not
had
a
fairy
as
godmother
who
would
take
upon
herself
the
task
of
counterbalancing
all
the
evil
experienced
in
life
by
showering
upon
the
adopted
the
whole
store
of
fairy
treasures
upon
that
evening
which
we
are
now
describing
meyerbeer
was
seated
next
to
heine
meyerbeer
for
whom
the
whole
catalogue
of
admiring
interjections
has
long
since
been
exhausted
creator
of
cyclopean
harmonics
as
he
was
he
passed
the
time
in
delight
when
following
the
detailed
arabesques
which
woven
in
transparent
gauze
wound
in
filmy
veils
around
the
delicate
conceptions
of
chopin
adolphe
nourrit
a
noble
artist
at
once
ascetic
and
passionate
was
also
there
he
was
a
sincere
almost
a
devout
catholic
dreaming
of
the
future
with
the
fervor
of
the
middle
ages
who
during
the
latter
part
of
his
life
refused
the
assistance
of
his
talent
to
any
scene
of
merely
superficial
sentiment
he
served
art
with
a
high
and
enthusiastic
respect
he
considered
it
in
all
its
divers
manifestations
only
a
holy
tabernacle
the
beauty
of
which
formed
the
splendor
of
the
true
already
undermined
by
a
melancholy
passion
for
the
beautiful
his
brow
seemed
to
be
turning
into
stone
under
the
dominion
of
this
haunting
feeling
a
feeling
always
explained
by
the
outbreak
of
despair
too
late
for
remedy
from
man
man
alas
so
eager
to
explore
the
secrets
of
the
heart
so
dull
to
divine
them
hiller
whose
talent
was
allied
to
chopin
and
who
was
one
of
his
most
intimate
friends
was
there
also
in
advance
of
the
great
compositions
which
he
afterwards
published
of
which
the
first
was
his
remarkable
oratorio
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
he
wrote
some
pieces
for
the
piano
among
these
those
known
under
the
title
of
etudes
vigorous
sketches
of
the
most
finished
design
recall
those
studies
of
foliage
in
which
the
landscape
painter
gives
us
an
entire
little
poem
of
light
and
shade
with
only
one
tree
one
branch
a
single
motif
happily
and
boldly
handled
in
the
presence
of
the
spectres
which
filled
the
air
and
whose
rustling
might
almost
be
heard
eugene
delacroix
remained
absorbed
and
silent
was
he
considering
what
pallet
what
brushes
what
canvas
he
must
use
to
introduce
them
into
visible
life
through
his
art
did
he
task
himself
to
discover
canvas
woven
by
arachne
brushes
made
from
the
long
eyelashes
of
the
fairies
and
a
pallet
covered
with
the
vaporous
tints
of
the
rainbow
in
order
to
make
such
a
sketch
possible
did
he
then
smile
at
these
fancies
yet
gladly
yield
to
the
impressions
from
which
they
sprung
because
great
talent
is
always
attracted
by
that
power
in
direct
contrast
to
its
own
the
aged
niemcevicz
who
appeared
to
be
the
nearest
to
the
grave
among
us
listened
to
the
historic
songs
which
chopin
translated
into
dramatic
execution
for
this
survivor
of
times
long
past
under
the
fingers
of
the
polish
artist
again
were
heard
side
by
side
with
the
descriptions
so
popular
of
the
polish
bard
the
shock
of
arms
the
songs
of
conquerors
the
hymns
of
triumph
the
complaints
of
illustrious
prisoners
and
the
wail
over
dead
heroes
they
memorized
together
the
long
course
of
national
glory
of
victory
of
kings
of
queens
of
warriors
and
so
much
life
had
these
phantoms
that
the
old
man
deeming
the
present
an
illusion
believed
the
olden
times
fully
resuscitated
dark
and
silent
apart
from
all
others
fell
the
motionless
profile
of
mickiewicz
the
dante
of
the
north
he
seemed
always
to
find
the
salt
of
the
stranger
bitter
and
his
steps
hard
to
mount
buried
in
a
fauteuil
with
her
arms
resting
upon
a
table
sat
madame
sand
curiously
attentive
gracefully
subdued
endowed
with
that
rare
faculty
only
given
to
a
few
elect
of
recognizing
the
beautiful
under
whatever
form
of
nature
or
of
art
it
may
assume
she
listened
with
the
whole
force
of
her
ardent
genius
the
faculty
of
instantaneously
recognizing
beauty
may
perhaps
be
the
second
sight
of
which
all
nations
have
acknowledged
the
existence
in
highly
gifted
women
it
is
a
kind
of
magical
gaze
which
causes
the
bark
the
mask
the
gross
envelope
of
form
to
fall
off
so
that
the
invisible
essence
the
soul
which
is
incarnated
within
may
be
clearly
contemplated
so
that
the
ideal
which
the
poet
or
artist
may
have
vivified
under
the
torrent
of
notes
the
passionate
veil
of
coloring
the
cold
chiseling
of
marble
or
the
mysterious
rhythms
of
strophes
may
be
fully
discerned
this
faculty
is
much
rarer
than
is
generally
supposed
it
is
usually
felt
but
vaguely
yet
in
its
highest
manifestations
it
reveals
itself
as
a
divining
oracle
knowing
the
past
and
prophesying
the
future
it
is
a
power
which
exempts
the
blessed
organization
which
it
illumes
from
the
bearing
of
the
heavy
burden
of
technicalities
with
which
the
merely
scientific
drag
on
toward
that
mystic
region
of
inner
life
which
the
gifted
attain
with
a
single
bound
it
is
a
faculty
which
springs
less
from
an
acquaintance
with
the
sciences
than
from
a
familiarity
with
nature
the
fascination
and
value
of
a
country
life
consist
in
the
long
with
nature
the
words
of
revelation
hidden
under
the
infinite
harmonies
of
form
of
sounds
of
lights
and
shadows
of
tones
and
warblings
of
terror
and
delight
may
best
be
caught
in
these
long
solitary
interviews
such
infinite
variety
may
appear
crushing
or
distracting
on
a
first
view
but
if
faced
with
a
courage
that
no
mystery
can
appal
if
sounded
with
a
resolution
that
no
length
of
time
can
abate
may
give
the
clue
to
analogies
conformities
relations
between
our
senses
and
our
sentiments
and
aid
us
in
tracing
the
hidden
links
which
bind
apparent
dissimilarities
identical
oppositions
and
equivalent
antitheses
and
teach
us
the
secrets
of
the
chasms
separating
with
narrow
but
impassable
space
that
which
is
destined
to
approach
forever
yet
never
mingle
to
resemble
ever
yet
never
blend
to
have
awakened
early
as
did
madame
sand
to
the
dim
whispering
with
which
nature
initiates
her
chosen
to
her
mystic
rites
is
a
necessary
appanage
of
the
poet
to
have
learned
from
her
to
penetrate
the
dreams
of
man
when
he
in
his
turn
creates
and
uses
in
his
works
the
tones
the
warblings
the
terrors
the
delights
requires
a
still
more
subtle
power
a
power
which
madame
sand
possesses
by
a
double
right
by
the
intuitions
of
her
heart
and
the
vigor
of
her
genius
after
having
named
madame
sand
whose
energetic
personality
and
electric
genius
inspired
the
frail
and
delicate
organization
of
chopin
with
an
intensity
of
admiration
which
consumed
him
as
a
wine
too
spirituous
shatters
the
fragile
vase
we
can
not
now
call
up
other
names
from
the
dim
limbus
of
the
past
in
which
so
many
indistinct
images
such
doubtful
sympathies
such
indefinite
projects
and
uncertain
beliefs
are
forever
surging
and
hurtling
perhaps
there
is
no
one
among
us
who
in
looking
through
the
long
vista
would
not
meet
the
ghost
of
some
feeling
whose
shadowy
form
he
would
find
impossible
to
pass
among
the
varied
interests
the
burning
desires
the
restless
tendencies
surging
through
the
epoch
in
which
so
many
high
hearts
and
brilliant
intellects
were
fortuitously
thrown
together
how
few
of
them
alas
possessed
sufficient
vitality
to
enable
them
to
resist
the
numberless
causes
of
death
surrounding
every
idea
every
feeling
as
well
as
every
individual
life
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
even
during
the
moments
of
the
troubled
existence
of
the
emotions
now
past
how
many
of
them
escaped
that
saddest
of
all
human
judgments
happy
oh
happy
were
it
dead
far
happier
had
it
never
been
born
among
the
varied
feelings
with
which
so
many
noble
hearts
throbbed
high
were
there
indeed
many
which
never
incurred
this
fearful
malediction
like
the
suicide
lover
in
mickiewicz
poem
who
returns
to
life
in
the
land
of
the
dead
only
to
renew
the
dreadful
suffering
of
his
earth
life
perhaps
among
all
the
emotions
then
so
vividly
felt
there
is
not
a
single
one
which
could
it
again
live
would
reappear
without
the
disfigurements
the
brandings
the
bruises
the
mutilations
which
were
inflicted
on
its
early
beauty
which
so
deeply
sullied
its
primal
innocence
and
if
we
should
persist
in
recalling
these
melancholy
ghosts
of
dead
thoughts
and
buried
feelings
from
the
heavy
folds
of
the
shroud
would
they
not
actually
appal
us
because
so
few
of
them
possessed
sufficient
purity
and
celestial
radiance
to
redeem
them
from
the
shame
of
being
utterly
disowned
entirely
repudiated
by
those
whose
bliss
or
torment
they
formed
during
the
passionate
hours
of
their
absolute
rule
in
very
pity
ask
us
not
to
call
from
the
dead
ghosts
whose
resurrection
would
be
so
painful
who
could
bear
the
sepulchral
ghastly
array
who
would
willingly
call
them
from
their
sheeted
sleep
if
our
ideas
thoughts
and
feelings
were
indeed
to
be
suddenly
aroused
from
the
unquiet
grave
in
which
they
lie
buried
and
an
account
demanded
from
them
of
the
good
and
evil
which
they
have
severally
produced
in
the
hearts
in
which
they
found
so
generous
an
asylum
and
which
they
have
confused
overwhelmed
illumined
devastated
ruined
broken
as
chance
or
destiny
willed
who
could
hope
to
endure
the
replies
that
would
be
made
to
questions
so
searching
if
among
the
group
of
which
we
have
spoken
every
member
of
which
has
won
the
attention
of
many
human
souls
and
must
in
consequence
bear
in
his
conscience
the
sharp
sting
of
multiplied
responsibilities
there
should
be
found
one
who
has
not
suffered
aught
that
was
pure
in
the
natural
attraction
which
bound
them
together
in
this
chain
of
glittering
links
to
fall
into
dull
forgetfulness
one
who
allowed
no
breath
of
the
fermentation
lingering
even
around
the
most
delicate
perfumes
to
embitter
his
memories
one
who
has
transfigured
and
left
to
the
immortality
of
art
only
the
unblemished
inheritance
of
all
that
was
noblest
in
their
enthusiasm
all
that
was
purest
and
most
lasting
of
their
joys
let
us
bow
before
him
as
before
one
of
the
elect
let
us
regard
him
as
one
of
those
whom
the
belief
of
the
people
marks
as
good
genii
the
attribution
of
superior
power
to
beings
believed
to
be
beneficent
to
man
has
received
a
sublime
conformation
from
a
great
italian
poet
who
defines
genius
as
a
stronger
impress
of
divinity
let
us
bow
before
all
who
are
marked
with
this
mystic
seal
but
let
us
venerate
with
the
deepest
truest
tenderness
those
who
have
only
used
their
wondrous
supremacy
to
give
life
and
expression
to
the
highest
and
most
exquisite
feelings
and
among
the
pure
and
beneficent
genii
of
earth
must
indubitably
be
ranked
the
artist
chopin
chapter
the
lives
of
artists
pure
fame
of
chopin
reserve
classic
and
romantic
of
the
sclaves
chopin
love
of
home
memories
a
natural
curiosity
is
generally
felt
to
know
something
of
the
lives
of
men
who
have
consecrated
their
genius
to
embellish
noble
feelings
through
works
of
art
through
which
they
shine
like
brilliant
meteors
in
the
eyes
of
the
surprised
and
delighted
crowd
the
admiration
and
sympathy
awakened
by
the
compositions
of
such
men
attach
immediately
to
their
own
names
which
are
at
once
elevated
as
symbols
of
nobility
and
greatness
because
the
world
is
loath
to
believe
that
those
who
can
express
high
sentiments
with
force
can
themselves
feel
ignobly
the
objects
of
this
benevolent
prejudice
this
favorable
presumption
are
expected
to
justify
such
suppositions
by
the
high
course
of
life
which
they
are
required
to
lead
when
it
is
seen
that
the
poet
feels
with
such
exquisite
delicacy
all
that
which
it
is
so
sweet
to
inspire
that
he
divines
with
such
rapid
intuition
all
that
pride
timidity
or
weariness
struggles
to
hide
that
he
can
paint
love
as
youth
dreams
it
but
as
riper
years
despair
to
realize
it
when
such
sublime
situations
seem
to
be
ruled
by
his
genius
which
raises
itself
so
calmly
above
the
calamities
of
human
destiny
always
finding
the
leading
threads
by
which
the
most
complicated
knots
in
the
tangled
skein
of
life
may
be
proudly
and
victoriously
unloosed
when
the
secret
modulations
of
the
most
exquisite
tenderness
the
most
heroic
courage
the
most
sublime
simplicity
are
known
to
be
subject
to
his
command
it
is
most
natural
that
the
inquiry
should
be
made
if
this
wondrous
divination
springs
from
a
sincere
faith
in
the
reality
of
the
noble
feelings
portrayed
or
whether
its
source
is
to
be
found
in
an
acute
perception
of
the
intellect
an
abstract
comprehension
of
the
logical
reason
the
question
in
what
the
life
led
by
men
so
enamored
of
beauty
differs
from
that
of
the
common
multitude
is
then
earnestly
asked
this
high
poetic
disdain
how
did
it
comport
itself
when
struggling
with
material
interests
these
ineffable
emotions
of
ethereal
love
how
were
they
guarded
from
the
bitterness
of
petty
cares
from
that
rapidly
growing
and
corroding
mould
which
usually
stifles
or
poisons
them
how
many
of
such
feelings
were
preserved
from
that
subtle
evaporation
which
robs
them
of
their
perfume
that
gradually
increasing
inconstancy
which
lulls
us
until
we
forget
to
call
the
dying
emotions
to
account
those
who
felt
such
holy
indignation
were
they
indeed
always
just
those
who
exalted
integrity
were
they
always
equitable
those
who
sung
of
honor
did
they
never
stoop
those
who
so
admired
fortitude
have
they
never
compromised
with
their
own
weakness
a
deep
interest
is
also
felt
in
ascertaining
how
those
to
whom
the
task
of
sustaining
our
faith
in
the
nobler
sentiments
through
art
has
been
intrusted
have
conducted
themselves
in
external
affairs
where
pecuniary
gain
is
only
to
be
acquired
at
the
expense
of
delicacy
loyalty
or
honor
many
assert
that
the
nobler
feelings
exist
only
in
the
works
of
art
when
some
unfortunate
occurrence
seems
to
give
a
deplorable
foundation
to
the
words
of
such
mockers
with
what
avidity
they
name
the
most
exquisite
conceptions
of
the
poet
vain
phantoms
how
they
plume
themselves
upon
their
own
wisdom
in
having
advocated
the
politic
doctrine
of
an
astute
yet
honeyed
hypocrisy
how
they
delight
to
speak
of
the
perpetual
contradiction
between
words
and
deeds
with
what
cruel
joy
they
detail
such
occurrences
and
cite
such
examples
in
the
presence
of
those
unsteady
restless
souls
who
are
incited
by
their
youthful
aspirations
and
by
the
depression
and
utter
loss
of
happy
confidence
which
such
a
conviction
would
entail
upon
them
to
struggle
against
a
distrust
so
blighting
when
such
wavering
spirits
are
engaged
in
the
bitter
combat
with
the
harsh
alternatives
of
life
or
tempted
at
every
turn
by
its
insinuating
seductions
what
a
profound
discouragement
seizes
upon
them
when
they
are
induced
to
believe
that
the
hearts
devoted
to
the
most
sublime
thoughts
the
most
deeply
initiated
in
the
most
delicate
susceptibilities
the
most
charmed
by
the
beauty
of
innocence
have
denied
by
their
acts
the
sincerity
of
their
worship
for
the
noble
themes
which
they
have
sung
as
poets
with
what
agonizing
doubts
are
they
not
filled
by
such
flagrant
contradictions
how
much
is
their
anguish
increased
by
the
jeering
mockery
of
those
who
repeat
poetry
is
only
that
which
might
have
been
and
who
delight
in
blaspheming
it
by
their
guilty
negations
whatever
may
be
the
human
of
the
gifted
believe
the
truths
they
sing
poetry
is
more
than
the
gigantic
shadow
of
our
own
imagination
immeasurably
increased
and
projected
upon
the
flying
plane
of
the
impossible
poetry
and
reality
are
not
two
incompatible
elements
destined
to
move
on
together
without
commingling
goethe
himself
confesses
this
in
speaking
of
a
contemporary
writer
he
says
that
having
lived
to
create
poems
he
had
also
made
his
life
a
poem
er
lebte
dichtend
und
dichtete
lebend
goethe
was
himself
too
true
a
poet
not
to
know
that
poetry
only
is
because
its
eternal
reality
throbs
in
the
noble
impulses
of
the
human
heart
we
have
once
before
remarked
that
genius
imposes
its
own
obligations
footnote
upon
paganini
after
his
death
if
the
examples
of
cold
austerity
and
of
rigid
disinterestedness
are
sufficient
to
awaken
the
admiration
of
calm
and
reflective
natures
whence
shall
more
passionate
and
mobile
organizations
to
whom
the
dullness
of
mediocrity
is
insipid
who
naturally
seek
honor
or
pleasure
and
who
are
willing
to
purchase
the
object
of
their
desires
at
any
price
form
their
models
such
temperaments
easily
free
themselves
from
the
authority
of
their
seniors
they
do
not
admit
their
competency
to
decide
they
accuse
them
of
wishing
to
use
the
world
only
for
the
profit
of
their
own
dead
passions
of
striving
to
turn
all
to
their
own
advantage
of
pronouncing
upon
the
effects
of
causes
which
they
do
not
understand
of
desiring
to
promulgate
laws
in
spheres
to
which
nature
has
denied
them
entrance
they
will
not
receive
answers
from
their
lips
but
turn
to
others
to
resolve
their
doubts
they
question
those
who
have
drunk
deeply
from
the
boiling
springs
of
grief
bursting
from
the
riven
clefts
in
the
steep
cliffs
upon
the
top
of
which
alone
the
soul
seeks
rest
and
light
they
pass
in
silence
by
the
still
cold
gravity
of
those
who
practice
the
good
without
enthusiasm
for
the
beautiful
what
leisure
has
ardent
youth
to
interpret
their
gravity
to
resolve
their
chill
problems
the
throbbings
of
its
impetuous
heart
are
too
rapid
to
allow
it
to
investigate
the
hidden
sufferings
the
mystic
combats
the
solitary
struggles
which
may
be
detected
even
in
the
calm
eye
of
the
man
who
practices
only
the
good
souls
in
continual
agitation
seldom
interpret
aright
the
calm
simplicity
of
the
just
or
the
heroic
smiles
of
the
stoic
for
them
enthusiasm
and
emotion
are
necessities
a
bold
image
persuades
them
a
metaphor
leads
them
tears
convince
them
they
prefer
the
conclusions
of
impulse
of
intuition
to
the
fatigue
of
logical
argument
thus
they
turn
with
an
eager
curiosity
to
the
poets
and
artists
who
have
moved
them
by
their
images
allured
them
by
their
metaphors
excited
them
by
their
enthusiasm
they
demand
from
them
the
explanation
the
purpose
of
this
enthusiasm
the
secret
of
this
beauty
when
distracted
by
events
when
tortured
by
intense
suffering
when
feeling
and
enthusiasm
seem
to
be
but
a
heavy
and
cumbersome
load
which
may
upset
the
if
not
thrown
overboard
into
the
abyss
of
forgetfulness
who
when
menaced
with
utter
shipwreck
after
a
long
struggle
with
peril
has
not
evoked
the
glorious
shades
of
those
who
have
conquered
whose
thoughts
glow
with
noble
ardor
to
inquire
from
them
how
far
their
aspirations
were
sincere
how
long
they
preserved
their
vitality
and
truth
who
has
not
exerted
an
ingenious
discernment
to
ascertain
how
much
of
the
generous
feeling
depicted
was
only
for
mental
amusement
a
mere
speculation
how
much
had
really
become
incorporated
with
the
habitual
acts
of
life
detraction
is
never
idle
in
such
cases
it
seizes
eagerly
upon
the
foibles
the
neglect
the
faults
of
those
who
have
been
degraded
by
any
weakness
alas
it
omits
nothing
it
chases
its
prey
it
accumulates
facts
only
to
distort
them
it
arrogates
to
itself
the
right
of
despising
the
inspiration
to
which
it
will
grant
no
authority
or
aim
but
to
furnish
amusement
denying
it
any
claim
to
guide
our
actions
our
resolutions
our
refusal
our
consent
detraction
knows
well
how
to
winnow
history
casting
aside
all
the
good
grain
it
carefully
gathers
all
the
tares
to
scatter
the
black
seed
over
the
brilliant
pages
in
which
the
purest
desires
of
the
heart
the
noblest
dreams
of
the
imagination
are
found
and
with
the
irony
of
assumed
victory
demands
what
the
grain
is
worth
which
only
germinates
dearth
and
famine
of
what
value
the
vain
words
which
only
nourish
sterile
feelings
of
what
use
are
excursions
into
realms
in
which
no
real
fruit
can
ever
be
gathered
of
what
possible
importance
are
emotions
and
enthusiasm
which
always
end
in
calculations
of
interest
covering
only
with
brilliant
veil
the
covert
struggles
of
egotism
and
venal
with
how
much
arrogant
derision
men
given
to
such
detraction
contrast
the
noble
thoughts
of
the
poet
with
his
unworthy
acts
the
high
compositions
of
the
artist
with
his
guilty
frivolity
what
a
haughty
superiority
they
assume
over
the
laborious
merit
of
the
men
of
guileless
honesty
whom
they
look
upon
as
crustacea
sheltered
from
temptation
by
the
immobility
of
weak
organizations
as
well
as
over
the
pride
of
those
who
believing
themselves
superior
to
such
temptations
do
not
they
assert
succeed
even
as
well
as
themselves
in
repudiating
the
pursuit
of
material
well
being
the
gratification
of
vanity
or
the
pleasure
of
immediate
enjoyment
what
an
easy
triumph
they
win
over
the
hesitation
the
doubt
the
repugnance
of
those
who
would
fain
cling
to
a
belief
in
the
possibility
of
the
union
of
vivid
feelings
passionate
impressions
intellectual
gifts
imaginative
temperaments
with
high
integrity
pure
lives
and
courses
of
conduct
in
perfect
harmony
with
poetic
ideals
it
is
therefore
impossible
not
to
feel
the
deepest
sadness
when
we
meet
with
any
fact
which
shows
us
the
poet
disobedient
to
the
inspiration
of
the
muses
those
guardian
angels
of
the
man
of
genius
who
would
willingly
teach
him
to
make
of
his
own
life
the
most
beautiful
of
poems
what
disastrous
doubts
in
the
minds
of
others
what
profound
discouragements
what
melancholy
apostasies
are
induced
by
the
faltering
steps
of
the
man
of
genius
and
yet
it
would
be
profanity
to
confound
his
errors
in
the
same
anathema
hurled
against
the
base
vices
of
meanness
the
shameless
effrontery
of
low
crime
it
would
be
sacrilege
if
the
acts
of
the
poet
have
sometimes
denied
the
spirit
of
his
song
have
not
his
songs
still
more
powerfully
denied
his
acts
may
not
the
limited
influence
of
his
private
actions
have
been
far
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
germs
of
creative
virtues
scattered
profusely
through
his
eloquent
writings
evil
is
contagious
but
good
is
truly
fruitful
the
poet
even
while
forcing
his
inner
convictions
to
give
way
to
his
personal
interest
still
acknowledges
and
ennobles
the
sentiments
which
condemn
himself
such
sentiments
attain
a
far
wider
influence
through
his
works
than
can
be
exerted
by
his
individual
acts
are
not
the
number
of
spirits
which
have
been
calmed
consoled
edified
through
these
works
far
greater
than
the
number
of
those
who
have
been
injured
by
the
errors
of
his
private
life
art
is
far
more
powerful
than
the
artist
his
creations
have
a
life
independent
of
his
vacillating
will
for
they
are
revelations
of
the
immutable
beauty
more
durable
than
himself
they
pass
on
from
generation
to
generation
let
us
hope
that
they
may
through
the
blessings
of
their
widely
spread
influence
contain
a
virtual
power
of
redemption
for
the
frequent
errors
of
their
gifted
authors
if
it
be
indeed
true
that
many
of
those
who
have
immortalized
their
sensibility
and
their
aspirations
by
robing
them
in
the
garb
of
surpassing
eloquence
have
nevertheless
stifled
these
high
aspirations
abused
these
quick
sensibilities
how
many
have
they
not
confirmed
strengthened
and
encouraged
to
pursue
a
noble
course
through
the
works
created
by
their
genius
a
generous
indulgence
towards
them
would
be
but
justice
it
is
hard
to
be
forced
to
claim
simple
justice
for
them
unpleasant
to
be
constrained
to
defend
those
whom
we
wish
to
be
admired
to
excuse
those
whom
we
wish
to
see
venerated
with
what
exultant
feelings
of
just
pride
may
the
friend
and
artist
remember
a
career
in
which
there
are
no
jarring
dissonances
no
contradictions
for
which
he
is
forced
to
claim
indulgence
no
errors
whose
source
must
be
found
in
palliation
of
their
existence
no
extreme
to
be
accounted
for
as
the
consequence
of
excess
of
cause
how
sweet
it
is
to
be
able
to
name
one
who
has
fully
proved
that
it
is
not
only
apathetic
beings
whom
no
fascination
can
attract
no
illusion
betray
who
are
able
to
limit
themselves
within
the
strict
routine
of
honored
and
honorable
laws
who
may
justly
claim
that
elevation
of
soul
which
no
reverse
subdues
and
which
is
never
found
in
contradiction
with
its
better
self
doubly
dear
and
doubly
honored
must
the
memory
of
chopin
in
this
respect
ever
remain
dear
to
the
friends
and
artists
who
have
known
him
in
his
lifetime
dear
to
the
unknown
friends
who
shall
learn
to
love
him
through
his
poetic
song
as
well
as
to
the
artists
who
in
succeeding
him
shall
find
their
glory
in
being
worthy
of
him
the
character
of
chopin
in
none
of
its
numerous
folds
concealed
a
single
movement
a
single
impulse
which
was
not
dictated
by
the
nicest
sense
of
honor
the
most
delicate
appreciation
of
affection
yet
no
nature
was
ever
more
formed
to
justify
eccentricity
whims
and
abrupt
caprices
his
imagination
was
ardent
his
feelings
almost
violent
his
physical
organization
weak
irritable
and
sickly
who
can
measure
the
amount
of
suffering
arising
from
such
contrasts
it
must
have
been
bitter
but
he
never
allowed
it
to
be
seen
he
kept
the
secret
of
his
torments
he
veiled
them
from
all
eyes
under
the
impenetrable
serenity
of
a
haughty
resignation
the
delicacy
of
his
heart
and
constitution
imposed
upon
him
the
torture
that
of
enduring
agonies
never
to
be
confessed
thus
giving
to
his
fate
some
of
the
darker
hues
of
feminine
destiny
excluded
by
the
infirm
state
of
his
health
from
the
exciting
arena
of
ordinary
activity
without
any
taste
for
the
useless
buzzing
in
which
a
few
bees
joined
with
many
wasps
expend
their
superfluous
strength
he
built
apart
from
all
noisy
and
frequented
routes
a
secluded
cell
for
himself
neither
adventures
embarrassments
nor
episodes
mark
his
life
which
he
succeeded
in
simplifying
although
surrounded
by
circumstances
which
rendered
such
a
result
difficult
of
attainment
his
own
feelings
his
own
impressions
were
his
events
more
important
in
his
eyes
than
the
chances
and
changes
of
external
life
he
constantly
gave
lessons
with
regularity
and
assiduity
domestic
and
daily
tasks
they
were
given
conscientiously
and
satisfactorily
as
the
devout
in
prayer
so
he
poured
out
his
soul
in
his
compositions
expressing
in
them
those
passions
of
the
heart
those
unexpressed
sorrows
to
which
the
pious
give
vent
in
their
communion
with
their
maker
what
they
never
say
except
upon
their
knees
he
said
in
his
palpitating
compositions
uttering
in
the
language
of
the
tones
those
mysteries
of
passion
and
of
grief
which
man
has
been
permitted
to
understand
without
words
because
there
are
no
words
adequate
for
their
expression
the
care
taken
by
chopin
to
avoid
the
of
life
to
eliminate
from
it
all
that
was
useless
to
prevent
its
crumbling
into
masses
without
form
has
deprived
his
own
course
of
incident
the
vague
lines
and
indications
surrounding
his
figure
like
misty
clouds
disappear
under
the
touch
which
would
strive
to
follow
or
trace
their
outlines
he
takes
part
in
no
actions
no
drama
no
entanglements
no
denouements
he
exercised
a
decisive
influence
upon
no
human
being
his
will
never
encroached
upon
the
desires
of
another
he
never
constrained
any
other
spirit
or
crashed
it
under
the
domination
of
his
own
he
never
tyrannized
over
another
heart
he
never
placed
a
conquering
hand
upon
the
destiny
of
another
being
he
sought
nothing
he
would
have
scorned
to
have
made
any
demands
like
tasso
he
might
say
brama
assai
poco
spera
e
nulla
chiede
in
compensation
he
escaped
from
all
ties
from
the
affections
which
might
have
influenced
him
or
led
him
into
more
tumultuous
spheres
ready
to
yield
all
he
never
gave
himself
perhaps
he
knew
what
exclusive
devotion
what
love
without
limit
he
was
worthy
of
inspiring
of
understanding
of
sharing
like
other
ardent
and
ambitions
natures
he
may
have
thought
if
love
and
friendship
are
not
all
they
are
nothing
perhaps
it
would
have
been
more
painful
for
him
to
have
accepted
a
part
any
thing
less
than
all
than
to
have
relinquished
all
and
thus
to
have
remained
at
least
faithful
to
his
impossible
ideal
if
these
things
have
been
so
or
not
none
ever
knew
for
he
rarely
spoke
of
love
or
friendship
he
was
not
exacting
like
those
whose
high
claims
and
just
demands
exceed
all
that
we
possess
to
offer
them
the
most
intimate
of
his
acquaintances
never
penetrated
to
that
secluded
fortress
in
which
the
soul
absent
from
his
common
life
dwelt
a
fortress
which
he
so
well
succeeded
in
concealing
that
its
very
existence
was
scarcely
suspected
in
his
relations
and
intercourse
with
others
he
always
seemed
occupied
in
what
interested
them
he
was
cautions
not
to
lead
them
from
the
circle
of
their
own
personality
lest
they
should
intrude
into
his
if
he
gave
up
but
little
of
his
time
to
others
at
least
of
that
which
he
did
relinquish
he
reserved
none
for
himself
no
one
ever
asked
him
to
give
an
account
of
his
dreams
his
wishes
or
his
hopes
no
one
seemed
to
wish
to
know
what
he
sighed
for
what
he
might
have
conquered
if
his
white
and
tapering
fingers
could
have
linked
the
brazen
chords
of
life
to
the
golden
ones
of
his
enchanted
lyre
no
one
had
leisure
to
think
of
this
in
his
presence
his
conversation
was
rarely
upon
subjects
of
any
deep
interest
he
glided
lightly
over
all
and
as
he
gave
but
little
of
his
time
it
was
easily
filled
with
the
details
of
the
day
he
was
careful
never
to
allow
himself
to
wander
into
digressions
of
which
he
himself
might
become
the
subject
his
individuality
rarely
excited
the
investigations
of
curiosity
or
awakened
vivid
scrutiny
he
pleased
too
much
to
excite
much
reflection
the
ensemble
of
his
person
was
harmonious
and
called
for
no
especial
commentary
his
blue
eye
was
more
spiritual
than
dreamy
his
bland
smile
never
writhed
into
bitterness
the
transparent
delicacy
of
his
complexion
pleased
the
eye
his
fair
hair
was
soft
and
silky
his
nose
slightly
aquiline
his
bearing
so
distinguished
and
his
manners
stamped
with
so
much
high
breeding
that
involuntarily
he
was
always
treated
en
prince
his
gestures
were
many
and
graceful
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
veiled
often
stifled
his
stature
was
low
and
his
limbs
slight
he
constantly
reminded
us
of
a
convolvulus
balancing
its
cup
upon
an
incredibly
slight
stem
the
tissue
of
which
is
so
like
vapor
that
the
slightest
contact
wounds
and
tears
the
misty
corolla
his
manners
in
society
possessed
that
serenity
of
mood
which
distinguishes
those
whom
no
ennui
annoys
because
they
expect
no
interest
he
was
generally
gay
his
caustic
spirit
caught
the
ridiculous
rapidly
and
far
below
the
surface
at
which
it
usually
strikes
the
eye
he
displayed
a
rich
vein
of
drollery
in
pantomime
he
often
amused
himself
by
reproducing
the
musical
formulas
and
peculiar
tricks
of
certain
virtuosi
in
the
most
burlesque
and
comic
improvisations
in
imitating
their
gestures
their
movements
in
counterfeiting
their
faces
with
a
talent
which
instantaneously
depicted
their
whole
personality
his
own
features
would
then
become
scarcely
recognizable
he
could
force
the
strangest
metamorphoses
upon
them
but
while
mimicking
the
ugly
and
grotesque
he
never
lost
his
own
native
grace
grimace
was
never
carried
far
enough
to
disfigure
him
his
gayety
was
so
much
the
more
piquant
because
he
always
restrained
it
within
the
limits
of
perfect
good
taste
holding
at
a
suspicious
distance
all
that
could
wound
the
most
fastidious
delicacy
he
never
made
use
of
an
inelegant
word
even
in
the
moments
of
the
most
entire
familiarity
an
improper
merriment
a
coarse
jest
would
have
been
shocking
to
him
through
a
strict
exclusion
of
all
subjects
relating
to
himself
from
conversation
through
a
constant
reserve
with
regard
to
his
own
feelings
he
always
succeeded
in
leaving
a
happy
impression
behind
him
people
in
general
like
those
who
charm
them
without
causing
them
to
fear
that
they
will
be
called
upon
to
render
aught
in
return
for
the
amusement
given
or
that
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
gayety
will
be
followed
by
the
sadness
of
melancholy
confidences
the
sight
of
mournful
faces
or
the
inevitable
reactions
which
occur
in
susceptible
natures
of
which
we
may
say
ubi
mel
ibi
fel
people
generally
like
to
keep
such
susceptible
natures
at
a
distance
they
dislike
to
be
brought
into
contact
with
their
melancholy
moods
though
they
do
not
refuse
a
kind
of
respect
to
the
mournful
feelings
caused
by
their
subtle
reactions
indeed
such
changes
possess
for
them
the
attraction
of
the
unknown
and
they
are
as
ready
to
take
delight
in
the
description
of
such
changing
caprices
as
they
are
to
avoid
their
reality
the
presence
of
chopin
was
always
feted
he
interested
himself
so
vividly
in
all
that
was
not
himself
that
his
own
personality
remained
intact
unapproached
and
unapproachable
under
the
polished
and
glassy
surface
upon
which
it
was
impossible
to
gain
footing
on
some
occasions
although
very
rarely
we
have
seen
him
deeply
agitated
we
have
seen
him
grow
so
pale
and
wan
that
his
appearance
was
actually
but
even
in
moments
of
the
most
intense
emotion
he
remained
concentrated
within
himself
a
single
instant
for
always
enabled
him
to
veil
the
secret
of
his
first
impression
however
full
of
spontaneity
his
bearing
afterwards
might
seem
to
be
it
was
instantaneously
the
effect
of
reflection
of
a
will
which
governed
the
strange
conflict
of
emotional
and
moral
energy
with
conscious
physical
debility
a
conflict
whose
strange
contrasts
were
forever
warring
vividly
within
the
dominion
exercised
over
the
natural
violence
of
his
character
reminds
us
of
the
melancholy
force
of
those
beings
who
seek
their
strength
in
isolation
and
entire
conscious
of
the
uselessness
of
their
vivid
indignation
and
vexation
and
too
jealous
of
the
mysteries
of
their
passions
to
betray
them
gratuitously
he
could
pardon
in
the
most
noble
manner
no
rancor
remained
in
his
heart
toward
those
who
had
wounded
him
though
such
wounds
penetrated
deeply
in
his
soul
and
fermented
there
in
vague
pain
and
internal
suffering
so
that
long
after
the
exciting
cause
had
been
effaced
from
his
memory
he
still
experienced
the
secret
torture
by
dint
of
constant
effort
in
spite
of
his
acute
and
tormenting
sensibilities
he
subjected
his
feelings
to
the
rule
rather
of
what
ought
to
be
than
of
what
is
thus
he
was
grateful
for
services
proceeding
rather
from
good
intentions
than
from
a
knowledge
of
what
would
have
been
agreeable
to
him
from
friendship
which
wounded
him
because
not
aware
of
his
acute
but
concealed
susceptibility
nevertheless
the
wounds
caused
by
such
awkward
miscomprehension
are
of
all
others
the
most
difficult
for
nervous
temperaments
to
bear
condemned
to
repress
their
vexation
such
natures
are
excited
by
degrees
to
a
state
of
constantly
gnawing
irritability
which
they
can
never
attribute
to
the
true
cause
it
would
be
a
gross
mistake
to
imagine
that
this
irritation
existed
without
provocation
but
as
a
dereliction
from
what
appeared
to
him
to
be
the
most
honorable
course
of
conduct
was
a
temptation
which
he
was
never
called
upon
to
resist
because
in
all
probability
it
never
presented
itself
to
him
so
he
never
in
the
presence
of
the
more
vigorous
and
therefore
more
brusque
and
positive
individualities
than
his
own
unveiled
the
shudder
if
repulsion
be
too
strong
a
term
caused
by
their
contact
or
association
the
reserve
which
marked
his
intercourse
with
others
extended
to
all
subjects
to
which
the
fanaticism
of
opinion
can
attach
his
own
sentiments
could
only
be
estimated
by
that
which
he
did
not
do
in
the
narrow
limits
of
his
activity
his
patriotism
was
revealed
in
the
course
taken
by
his
genius
in
the
choice
of
his
friends
in
the
preferences
given
to
his
pupils
and
in
the
frequent
and
great
services
which
he
rendered
to
his
compatriots
but
we
can
not
remember
that
he
took
any
pleasure
in
the
expression
of
this
feeling
if
he
sometimes
entered
upon
the
topic
of
politics
so
vividly
attacked
so
warmly
defended
so
frequently
discussed
in
prance
it
was
rather
to
point
out
what
he
deemed
dangerous
or
erroneous
in
the
opinions
advanced
by
others
than
to
win
attention
for
his
own
in
constant
connection
with
some
of
the
most
brilliant
politicians
of
the
day
he
knew
how
to
limit
the
relations
between
them
to
a
personal
attachment
entirely
independent
of
political
interests
democracy
presented
to
his
view
an
agglomeration
of
elements
too
heterogeneous
too
restless
wielding
too
much
savage
power
to
win
his
sympathies
the
entrance
of
social
and
political
questions
into
the
arena
of
popular
discussion
was
compared
more
than
twenty
years
ago
to
a
new
and
bold
incursion
of
barbarians
chopin
was
peculiarly
and
painfully
struck
by
the
terror
which
this
comparison
awakened
he
despaired
of
obtaining
the
safety
of
rome
from
these
modern
attilas
he
feared
the
destruction
of
art
its
monuments
its
refinements
its
civilization
in
a
word
he
dreaded
the
loss
of
the
elegant
cultivated
if
somewhat
indolent
ease
described
by
horace
would
the
graceful
elegancies
of
life
the
high
culture
of
the
arts
indeed
be
safe
in
the
rude
and
devastating
hands
of
the
new
barbarians
he
followed
at
a
distance
the
progress
of
events
and
an
acuteness
of
perception
which
he
would
scarcely
have
been
supposed
to
possess
often
enabled
him
to
predict
occurrences
which
were
not
anticipated
even
by
the
best
informed
but
though
such
observations
escaped
him
he
never
developed
them
his
concise
remarks
attracted
no
attention
until
time
proved
their
truth
his
good
sense
full
of
acuteness
had
early
persuaded
him
of
the
perfect
vacuity
of
the
greater
part
of
political
orations
of
theological
discussions
of
philosophic
digressions
he
began
early
to
practice
the
favorite
maxim
of
a
man
of
great
distinction
whom
we
have
often
heard
repeat
a
remark
dictated
by
the
misanthropic
wisdom
of
age
which
was
then
startling
to
our
inexperienced
impetuosity
but
which
has
since
frequently
struck
us
by
its
melancholy
truth
you
will
be
persuaded
one
day
as
i
am
said
the
marquis
de
noailles
to
the
young
people
whom
he
honored
with
his
attention
and
who
were
becoming
heated
in
some
naive
discussions
of
differing
opinions
that
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
talk
about
any
thing
to
any
body
a
guere
moyen
de
causer
de
quoi
que
ce
soit
avec
qui
que
ce
soit
sincerely
religious
and
attached
to
catholicity
chopin
never
touched
upon
this
subject
but
held
his
faith
without
attracting
attention
to
it
one
might
have
been
acquainted
with
him
for
a
long
time
without
knowing
exactly
what
his
religious
opinion
were
perhaps
to
console
his
inactive
hand
an
reconcile
it
with
his
lute
he
persuaded
himself
to
think
il
mondo
va
da
se
we
have
frequently
watched
him
during
the
progress
of
long
animated
and
stormy
discussions
in
which
he
would
take
no
part
in
the
excitement
of
the
debate
he
was
forgotten
by
the
speakers
but
we
have
often
neglected
to
follow
the
chain
of
their
reasoning
to
fix
our
attention
upon
the
features
of
chopin
which
were
almost
imperceptibly
contracted
when
subjects
touching
upon
the
most
important
conditions
of
our
existence
were
discussed
with
such
eagerness
and
ardor
that
it
might
have
been
thought
our
fates
were
to
be
instantly
decided
by
the
result
of
the
debate
at
such
times
he
appeared
to
us
like
a
passenger
on
board
of
a
vessel
driven
and
tossed
by
tempests
upon
the
stormful
waves
thinking
of
his
distant
country
watching
the
horizon
the
stars
the
manoeuvres
of
the
sailors
counting
their
fatal
mistakes
without
possessing
in
himself
sufficient
force
to
seize
a
rope
or
the
energy
requisite
to
haul
in
a
fluttering
sail
on
one
single
subject
he
relinquished
his
premeditated
silence
his
cherished
neutrality
in
the
cause
of
art
he
broke
through
his
reserve
he
never
abdicated
upon
this
topic
the
explicit
enunciation
of
his
opinions
he
applied
himself
with
great
perseverance
to
extend
the
limits
of
his
influence
upon
this
subject
it
was
a
tacit
confession
that
he
considered
himself
legitimately
possessed
of
the
authority
of
a
great
artist
in
questions
which
he
dignified
by
his
competence
he
never
left
any
doubt
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
his
opinions
during
several
years
his
appeals
were
full
of
impassioned
ardor
but
later
the
triumph
of
his
opinions
having
diminished
the
interest
of
his
role
he
sought
no
further
occasion
to
place
himself
as
leader
as
the
bearer
of
any
banner
in
the
only
occurrence
in
which
he
took
part
in
the
conflict
of
parties
he
gave
proof
of
opinions
absolute
tenacious
and
inflexible
as
those
which
rarely
come
to
the
light
usually
are
shortly
after
his
arrival
in
paris
in
a
new
school
was
formed
both
in
literature
and
music
and
youthful
talent
appeared
which
shook
off
with
eclat
the
yoke
of
ancient
formulas
the
scarcely
lulled
political
effervescence
of
the
first
years
of
the
revolution
of
july
passed
into
questions
upon
art
and
letters
which
attracted
the
attention
and
interest
of
all
minds
romanticism
was
the
order
of
the
day
they
fought
with
obstinacy
for
and
against
it
what
truce
could
there
be
between
those
who
would
not
admit
the
possibility
of
writing
in
any
other
than
the
already
established
manner
and
those
who
thought
that
the
artist
should
be
allowed
to
choose
such
forms
as
he
deemed
best
suited
for
the
expression
of
his
ideas
that
the
rule
of
form
should
be
found
in
the
agreement
of
the
chosen
form
with
the
sentiments
to
be
expressed
every
different
shade
of
feeling
requiring
of
course
a
different
mode
of
expression
the
former
believed
in
the
existence
of
a
permanent
form
whose
perfection
represented
absolute
beauty
but
in
admitting
that
the
great
masters
had
attained
the
highest
limits
in
art
had
reached
supreme
perfection
they
left
to
the
artists
who
succeeded
them
no
other
glory
than
the
hope
of
approaching
these
models
more
or
less
closely
by
imitation
thus
frustrating
all
hope
of
ever
equalling
them
because
the
perfecting
of
any
process
can
never
rival
the
merit
of
its
invention
the
latter
denied
that
the
immaterial
beautiful
could
have
a
fixed
and
absolute
form
the
different
forms
which
had
appeared
in
the
history
of
art
seemed
to
them
like
tents
spread
in
the
interminable
route
of
the
ideal
mere
momentary
halting
places
which
genius
attains
from
epoch
to
epoch
and
beyond
which
the
inheritors
of
the
past
should
strive
to
advance
the
former
wished
to
restrict
the
creations
of
times
and
natures
the
most
dissimilar
within
the
limits
of
the
same
symmetrical
frame
the
latter
claimed
for
all
writers
the
liberty
of
creating
their
own
mode
accepting
no
other
rules
than
those
which
result
from
the
direct
relation
of
sentiment
and
form
exacting
only
that
the
form
should
be
adequate
to
the
expression
of
the
sentiment
however
admirable
the
existing
models
might
be
they
did
not
appear
to
them
to
have
exhausted
all
the
range
of
sentiments
upon
which
art
might
seize
or
all
the
forms
which
it
might
advantageously
use
not
contented
with
the
mere
excellence
of
form
they
sought
it
so
far
only
as
its
perfection
is
indispensable
for
the
complete
revelation
of
the
idea
for
they
were
not
ignorant
that
the
sentiment
is
maimed
if
the
form
remain
imperfect
any
imperfection
in
it
like
an
opaque
veil
intercepting
the
raying
of
the
pure
idea
thus
they
elevated
what
had
otherwise
been
the
mere
work
of
the
trade
into
the
sphere
of
poetic
inspiration
they
enjoined
upon
genius
and
patience
the
task
of
inventing
a
form
which
would
satisfy
the
exactions
of
the
inspiration
they
reproached
their
adversaries
with
attempting
to
reduce
inspiration
to
the
bed
of
procrustes
because
they
refused
to
admit
that
there
are
sentiments
which
can
not
be
expressed
in
forms
which
have
been
determined
upon
beforehand
and
of
thus
robbing
art
in
advance
even
of
their
creation
of
all
works
which
might
attempt
the
introduction
of
newly
awakened
ideas
newly
clad
in
new
forms
forms
and
ideas
both
naturally
arising
from
the
naturally
progressive
development
of
the
human
spirit
the
improvement
of
the
instruments
and
the
consequent
increase
of
the
material
resources
of
art
those
who
saw
the
flames
of
genius
devour
the
old
crumbling
skeletons
attached
themselves
to
the
musical
school
of
which
the
most
gifted
the
most
brilliant
the
most
daring
representative
was
berlioz
chopin
joined
this
school
he
persisted
most
strenuously
in
freeing
himself
from
the
servile
formulas
of
conventional
style
while
he
earnestly
repudiated
the
charlatanism
which
sought
to
replace
the
old
abuses
only
by
the
introduction

campaign
of

in
which
some
of
the
trial
blows
were
chopin
remained
invariable
in
his
predilections
as
well
as
in
his
repulsions
he
did
not
admit
the
least
compromise
with
those
who
in
his
opinion
did
not
sufficiently
represent
progress
and
who
in
their
refusal
to
relinquish
the
desire
of
displaying
art
for
the
profit
of
the
trade
in
their
pursuit
of
transitory
effects
of
success
won
only
from
the
astonishment
of
the
audience
gave
no
proof
of
sincere
devotion
to
progress
he
broke
the
ties
which
he
had
contracted
with
respect
when
he
felt
restricted
by
them
or
bound
too
closely
to
the
shore
by
cordage
which
he
knew
to
be
decayed
he
obstinately
refused
on
the
other
hand
to
form
ties
with
the
young
artists
whose
success
which
he
deemed
exaggerated
elevated
a
certain
kind
of
merit
too
highly
he
never
gave
the
least
praise
to
any
thing
which
he
did
not
believe
to
be
a
real
conquest
for
art
or
which
did
not
evince
a
serious
conception
of
the
task
of
an
artist
he
did
not
wish
to
be
lauded
by
any
party
to
be
aided
by
the
manoeuvres
of
any
faction
or
by
the
concessions
made
by
any
schools
in
the
persons
of
their
chiefs
in
the
midst
of
jealousies
encroachments
forfeitures
and
invasions
of
the
different
branches
of
art
negotiations
treaties
and
contracts
have
been
introduced
like
the
means
and
appliances
of
diplomacy
with
all
the
artifices
inseparable
from
such
a
course
in
refusing
the
support
of
any
accessory
aid
for
his
productions
he
proved
that
he
confidently
believed
that
their
own
beauty
would
ensure
their
appreciation
and
that
he
did
not
struggle
to
facilitate
their
immediate
reception
he
supported
our
struggles
at
that
time
so
full
of
uncertainty
when
we
met
more
sages
shaking
their
heads
than
glorious
adversaries
with
his
calm
and
unalterable
conviction
he
aided
us
with
opinions
so
fixed
that
neither
weariness
nor
artifice
could
shake
them
with
a
rare
immutability
of
will
and
that
efficacious
assistance
which
the
creation
of
meritorious
works
always
brings
to
a
struggling
cause
when
it
can
claim
them
as
its
own
he
mingled
so
many
charms
so
much
moderation
so
much
knowledge
with
his
daring
innovations
that
the
prompt
admiration
he
inspired
fully
justified
the
confidence
he
placed
in
his
own
genius
the
solid
studies
which
he
had
made
the
reflective
habits
of
his
youth
the
worship
for
classic
models
in
which
he
had
been
educated
preserved
him
from
losing
his
strength
in
blind
gropings
in
doubtful
triumphs
as
has
happened
to
more
than
one
partisan
of
the
new
ideas
his
studious
patience
in
the
elaboration
of
his
works
sheltered
him
from
the
critics
who
envenomed
the
dissensions
by
seizing
upon
those
easy
and
insignificant
victories
due
to
omissions
and
the
negligence
of
inadvertence
early
trained
to
the
exactions
and
restrictions
of
rules
having
produced
compositions
filled
with
beauty
when
subjected
to
all
their
fetters
he
never
shook
them
off
without
an
appropriate
cause
and
after
due
reflection
in
virtue
of
his
principles
he
always
progressed
but
without
being
led
into
exaggeration
or
lured
by
compromise
he
willingly
relinquished
theoretic
formulas
to
pursue
their
results
less
occupied
with
the
disputes
of
the
schools
and
their
terms
than
in
producing
himself
the
best
argument
a
finished
work
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
avoid
personal
enmities
and
vexatious
accommodations
chopin
had
that
reverential
worship
for
art
which
characterized
the
first
masters
of
the
middle
ages
but
in
expression
and
bearing
he
was
more
simple
modern
and
less
ecstatic
as
for
them
so
art
was
for
him
a
high
and
holy
vocation
like
them
he
was
proud
of
his
election
for
it
and
honored
it
with
devout
piety
this
feeling
was
revealed
at
the
hour
of
his
death
through
an
occurrence
the
significance
of
which
is
more
fully
explained
by
a
knowledge
of
the
manners
prevalent
in
poland
by
a
custom
which
still
exists
although
it
is
now
falling
into
disuse
the
poles
often
chose
the
garments
in
which
they
wished
to
be
buried
and
which
were
frequently
prepared

long
time

for

at

their

were

were
thus
at
the
hour
of
death
betrayed
monastic
robes
were
frequently
chosen
by
worldly
men
the
costumes
of
official
charges
were
selected
or
refused
as
the
remembrances
connected
with
them
were
glorious
or
painful
chopin
who
although
among
the
first
of
contemporary
artists
had
given
the
fewest
concerts
wished
notwithstanding
to
be
borne
to
the
grave
in
the
clothes
which
he
had
worn
on
such
occasions
a
natural
and
profound
feeling
springing
from
the
inexhaustible
sources
of
art
without
doubt
dictated
this
dying
request
when
having
scrupulously
fulfilled
the
last
duties
of
a
christian
he
left
all
of
earth
which
he
could
not
bear
with
him
to
the
skies
he
had
linked
his
love
for
art
and
his
faith
in
it
with
immortality
long
before
the
approach
of
death
and
as
he
robed
himself
for
his
long
sleep
in
the
grave
he
gave
as
was
customary
with
him
by
a
mute
symbol
the
last
touching
proof
of
the
conviction
he
had
preserved
intact
during
the
whole
course
of
his
life
faithful
to
himself
he
died
adoring
art
in
its
mystic
greatness
its
highest
revelations
in
retiring
from
the
turmoil
of
society
chopin
concentrated
his
cares
and
affections
upon
the
circle
of
his
own
family
and
his
early
acquaintances
without
any
interruption
he
preserved
close
relations
with
them
never
ceasing
to
keep
them
up
with
the
greatest
care
his
sister
louise
was
especially
dear
to
him
a
resemblance
in
the
character
of
their
minds
the
bent
of
their
feelings
bound
them
closely
to
each
other
louise
frequently
came
from
warsaw
to
paris
to
see
him
she
spent
the
last
three
months
of
his
life
with
the
brother
she
loved
watching
over
him
with
undying
affection
chopin
kept
up
a
regular
correspondence
with
the
members
of
his
own
family
but
only
with
them
it
was
one
of
his
peculiarities
to
write
letters
to
no
others
it
might
almost
have
been
thought
that
he
had
made
a
vow
to
write
to
no
strangers
it
was
curious
enough
to
see
him
resort
to
all
kinds
of
expedients
to
escape
the
necessity
of
tracing
the
most
insignificant
note
many
times
he
has
traversed
paris
from
one
end
to
the
other
to
decline
an
invitation
to
dinner
or
to
give
some
trivial
information
rather
than
write
a
few
lines
which
would
have
spared
him
all
this
trouble
and
loss
of
time
his
handwriting
was
quite
unknown
to
the
greatest
number
of
his
friends
it
is
said
he
sometimes
departed
from
this
custom
in
favor
of
his
beautiful
countrywomen
some
of
whom
possess
several
of
his
notes
written
in
polish
this
infraction
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
law
with
him
may
be
attributed
to
the
pleasure
he
took
in
the
use
of
this
language
he
always
used
it
with
the
people
of
his
own
country
and
loved
to
translate
its
most
expressive
phrases
he
was
a
good
french
scholar
as
the
sclaves
generally
are
in
consequence
of
his
french
origin
the
language
had
been
taught
him
with
peculiar
care
but
he
did
not
like
it
he
did
not
think
it
sufficiently
sonorous
and
he
deemed
its
genius
cold
this
opinion
is
very
prevalent
among
the
poles
who
although
speaking
it
with
great
facility
often
better
than
their
native
tongue
and
frequently
using
it
in
their
intercourse
with
each
other
yet
complain
to
those
who
do
not
speak
polish
of
the
impossibility
of
rendering
the
thousand
ethereal
and
shifting
modes
of
thought
in
any
other
idiom
in
their
opinion
it
is
sometimes
dignity
sometimes
grace
sometimes
passion
which
is
wanting
in
the
french
language
if
they
are
asked
the
meaning
of
a
word
or
a
phrase
which
they
may
have
cited
in
polish
the
reply
invariably
is
oh
that
can
not
be
translated
then
follow
explanations
serving
as
comments
to
the
exclamation
of
all
the
subtleties
all
the
shades
of
meaning
all
the
delicacies
contained
in
the
not
to
be
translated
words
we
have
cited
some
examples
which
joined
to
others
induce
us
to
believe
that
this
language
has
the
advantage
of
making
images
of
abstract
nouns
and
that
in
the
course
of
its
development
through
the
poetic
genius
of
the
nation
it
has
been
enabled
to
establish
striking
and
just
relations
between
ideas
by
etymologies
derivations
and
synonymes
colored
reflections
of
light
and
shade
are
thus
thrown
upon
all
expressions
so
that
they
necessarily
call
into
vibration
through
the
mind
the
correspondent
tone
of
a
third
which
modulates
the
thought
into
a
major
or
minor
mode
the
richness
of
the
language
always
permits
the
choice
of
the
mode
but
this
very
richness
may
become
a
difficulty
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
general
use
of
foreign
tongues
in
poland
may
be
attributed
to
indolence
of
mind
or
want
of
application
may
be
traced
to
a
desire
to
escape
the
necessary
labor
of
acquiring
that
mastery
of
diction
indispensable
in
a
language
so
full
of
sudden
depths
of
laconic
energy
that
it
is
very
difficult
if
not
quite
impossible
to
support
in
it
the
commonplace
the
vague
agreements
of
badly
defined
ideas
can
not
be
compressed
in
the
nervous
strength
of
its
grammatical
forms
the
thought
if
it
be
really
low
can
not
be
elevated
from
its
debasement
or
poverty
if
it
really
soar
above
the
commonplace
it
requires
a
rare
precision
of
terms
not
to
appear
uncouth
or
fantastic
in
consequence
of
this
in
proportion
to
the
works
published
the
polish
literature
should
be
able
to
show
a
greater
number
of
than
can
be
done
in
any
other
language
he
who
ventures
to
use
this
tongue
must
feel
himself
already
master
footnote
it
can
not
be
reproached
with
a
want
of
harmony
or
musical
charm
the
harshness
of
a
language
does
not
always
and
absolutely
depend
upon
the
number
of
consonants
but
rather
upon
the
manner
of
their
association
we
might
even
assert
that
in
consequence
of
the
absence
of
and
strongly
marked
sounds
some
languages
have
a
dull
and
cold
coloring
it
is
the
frequent
repetition
of
certain
consonants
which
gives
shadow
rhythm
and
vigor
to
a
tongue
the
vowels
imparting
only
a
kind
of
light
clear
hue
which
requires
to
be
brought
out
by
deeper
shades
it
is
the
sharp
uncouth
or
unharmonious
clashing
of
heterogeneous
consonants
which
strikes
the
ear
painfully
it
is
true
the
sclavic
languages
make
use
of
many
consonants
but
their
connection
is
generally
sonorous
sometimes
pleasant
to
the
ear
and
scarcely
ever
entirely
discordant
even
when
the
combinations
are
more
striking
than
agreeable
the
quality
of
the
sounds
is
rich
full
and
varied
they
are
not
straitened
and
contracted
as
if
produced
in
a
narrow
medium
but
extending
through
a
considerable
register
range
through
a
variety
of
intonations
the
letter
l
almost
impossible
for
those
to
pronounce
who
have
not
acquired
the
pronunciation
in
their
infancy
has
nothing
harsh
in
its
sound
the
ear
receives
from
it
an
impression
similar
to
that
which
is
made
upon
the
fingers
by
the
touch
of
a
thick
woolen
velvet
rough
but
at
the
same
time
yielding
the
union
of
jarring
consonants
being
rare
and
the
assonances
easily
multiplied
the
same
comparison
might
be
employed
to
the
ensemble
of
the
effect
produced
by
these
idioms
upon
foreigners
many
words
occur
in
polish
which
imitate
the
sound
of
the
thing
designated
by
them
the
frequent
repetition
of
ch
h
aspirated
of
sz
ch
in
french
of
rz
of
cz
so
frightful
to
a
profane
eye
have
however
nothing
barbaric
in
their
sounds
being
pronounced
nearly
like
geai
and
tche
and
greatly
facilitate
imitations
of
the
sense
by
the
sound
the
word
dzwiek
read
dzwiinque
meaning
sound
offers
a
characteristic
example
of
this
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
word
which
would
reproduce
more
accurately
the
sensation
which
a
diapason
makes
upon
the
ear
among
the
consonants
accumulated
in
groups
producing
very
different
sounds
sometimes
metallic
sometimes
buzzing
hissing
or
rumbling
many
diphthongs
and
vowels
are
mingled
which
sometimes
become
slightly
nasal
the
a
and
e
being
sounded
as
on
and
in
in
french
when
they
are
accompanied
by
a
cedilla
in
juxtaposition
with
the
e
tse
which
is
pronounced
with
great
softness
sometimes
c
tsie
the
accented
s
is
almost
warbled
the
z
has
three
sounds
the
z
jais
the
z
zed
and
the
z
zied
the
y
forms
a
vowel
of
a
muffled
tone
which
as
the
l
can
not
be
represented
by
any
equivalent
sound
in
french
and
which
like
it
gives
a
variety
of
ineffable
shades
to
the
language
these
fine
and
light
elements
enable
the
polish
women
to
assume
a
lingering
and
singing
accent
which
they
usually
transport
into
other
tongues
when
the
subjects
are
serious
or
melancholy
after
such
recitatives
or
improvised
lamentations
they
have
a
sort
of
lisping
infantile
manner
of
speaking
which
they
vary
by
light
silvery
laughs
little
interjectional
cries
short
musical
pauses
upon
the
higher
notes
from
which
they
descend
by
one
knows
not
what
chromatic
scale
of
demi
and
quarter
tones
to
rest
upon
some
low
note
and
again
pursue
the
varied
brusque
and
original
modulations
which
astonish
the
ear
not
accustomed
to
such
lovely
warblings
to
which
they
sometimes
give
that
air
of
caressing
irony
of
cunning
mockery
peculiar
to
the
song
of
some
birds
they
love
to
zinzilyler
and
charming
changes
piquant
intervals
unexpected
cadences
naturally
find
place
in
this
fondling
prattle
making
the
language
far
more
sweet
and
caressing
when
spoken
by
the
women
than
it
is
in
the
mouths
of
the
men
the
men
indeed
pride
themselves
upon
speaking
it
with
elegance
impressing
upon
it
a
masculine
sonorousness
which
is
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
energetic
movements
of
manly
eloquence
formerly
so
much
cultivated
in
poland
poetry
commands
such
a
diversity
of
prosodies
of
rhymes
of
rhythms
such
an
abundance
of
assonances
from
these
rich
and
varied
materials
that
it
is
almost
possible
to
follow
musically
the
feelings
and
scenes
which
it
depicts
not
only
in
mere
expressions
in
which
the
sound
repeats
the
sense
but
also
in
long
declamations
the
analogy
between
the
polish
and
russian
has
been
compared
to
that
which
obtains
between
the
latin
and
italian
the
russian
language
is
indeed
more
mellifluous
more
lingering
more
caressing
fuller
of
sighs
than
the
polish
its
cadencing
is
peculiarly
fitted
for
song
the
finer
poems
such
as
those
of
zukowski
and
pouchkin
seem
to
contain
a
melody
already
designated
in
the
metre
of
the
verses
for
example
it
would
appear
quite
possible
to
detach
an
arioso
or
a
sweet
cantiable
from
some
of
the
stanzas
of
le
chale
noir
or
the
talisman
the
ancient
sclavonic
which
is
the
language
of
the
eastern
church
possesses
great
majesty
more
guttural
than
the
idioms
which
have
arisen
from
it
it
is
severe
and
monotonous
yet
of
great
dignity
like
the
byzantine
paintings
preserved
in
the
worship
to
which
it
is
consecrated
it
has
throughout
the
characteristics
of
a
sacred
language
which
has
only
been
used
for
the
expression
of
one
feeling
and
has
never
been
modulated
or
fashioned
by
profane
wants
chopin
mingled
a
charming
grace
with
all
the
intercourse
which
he
held
with
his
relatives
not
satisfied
with
limiting
his
whole
correspondence
to
them
alone
he
profited
by
his
stay
in

to
procure
for

the
thousand
agreeable
surprises
given
by
the
novelties
the
bagatelles
the
little

or
attract
as
being
the
first
seen
of
their
kind
he
sought
for
all
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
would
please
his
friends
in
warsaw
adding
constant
presents
to
his
many
letters
it
was
his
wish
that
his
gifts
should
be
preserved
that
through
the
memories
linked
with
them
he
might
be
often
remembered
by
those
to
whom
they
were
sent
he
attached
the
greatest
importance
on
his
side
to
all
the
evidences
of
their
affection
for
him
to
receive
news
or
some
mark
of
their
remembrance
was
always
a
festival
for
him
he
never
shared
this
pleasure
with
any
one
but
it
was
plainly
visible
in
his
conduct
he
took
the
greatest
care
of
every
thing
that
came
from
his
distant
friends
the
least
of
their
gifts
was
precious
to
him
he
never
allowed
others
to
make
use
of
them
indeed
he
was
visibly
uneasy
if
they
touched
them
material
elegance
was
as
natural
to
him
as
mental
this
was
evinced
in
the
objects
with
which
he
surrounded
himself
as
well
as
in
the
aristocratic
grace
of
his
manners
he
was
passionately
fond
of
flowers
without
aiming
at
the
brilliant
luxury
with
which
at
that
epoch
some
of
the
celebrities
in
paris
decorated
their
apartments
he
knew
how
to
keep
upon
this
point
as
well
as
in
his
style
of
dress
the
instinctive
line
of
perfect
propriety
not
wishing
the
course
of
his
life
his
thoughts
his
time
to
be
associated
or
shackled
in
any
way
by
the
pursuits
of
others
he
preferred
the
society
of
ladies
as
less
apt
to
force
him
into
subsequent
relations
he
willingly
spent
whole
evenings
in
playing
blind
man
buff
with
the
young
people
telling
them
little
stories
to
make
them
break
into
the
silvery
laughs
of
youth
sweeter
than
the
song
of
the
nightingale
he
was
fond
of
a
life
in
the
country
or
the
life
of
the
chateau
he
was
ingenious
in
varying
its
amusements
in
multiplying
its
enjoyments
he
also
loved
to
compose
there
many
of
his
best
works
written
in
such
moments
perhaps
embalm
and
hallow
the
memories
of
his
happiest
days
chapter

birth
and

of
chopin
national
artists
chopin
embodies
in
himself
the
poetic
sense
of
his
whole
nation
opinion
of
beethoven
chopin
was
born
in
at
near
warsaw
unlike
most
other
children
he
could
not
during
his
childhood
remember
his
own
age
and
the
date
of
his
birth
was
only
fixed
in
his
memory
by
a
watch
given
him
in
by
madame
catalani
which
bore
the
following
inscription
madame
catalani
to
frederic
chopin
aged
ten
years
perhaps
the
presentiments
of
the
artist
gave
to
the
child
a
foresight
of
his
future
nothing
extraordinary
marked
the
course
of
his
boyhood
his
internal
development
traversed
but
few
phases
and
gave
but
few
manifestations
as
he
was
fragile
and
sickly
the
attention
of
his
family
was
concentrated
upon
his
health
doubtless
it
was
from
this
cause
that
he
acquired
his
habits
of
affability
his
patience
under
suffering
his
endurance
of
every
annoyance
with
a
good
grace
qualities
which
he
early
acquired
from
his
wish
to
calm
the
constant
anxiety
that
was
felt
with
regard
to
him
no
precocity
of
his
faculties
no
precursory
sign
of
remarkable
development
revealed
in
his
early
years
his
future
superiority
of
soul
mind
or
capacity
the
little
creature
was
seen
suffering
indeed
but
always
trying
to
smile
patient
and
apparently
happy
and
his
friends
were
so
glad
that
he
did
not
become
moody
or
morose
that
they
were
satisfied
to
cherish
his
good
qualities
believing
that
he
opened
his
heart
to
them
without
reserve
and
gave
to
them
all
his
secret
thoughts
but
there
are
souls
among
us
who
resemble
rich
travelers
thrown
among
simple
herdsmen
loading
them
with
gifts
during
their
sojourn
among
them
truly
not
at
all
in
proportion
to
their
own
wealth
yet
which
are
quite
sufficient
to
astonish
the
poor
hosts
and
to
spread
riches
and
happiness
in
the
midst
of
such
simple
habits
it
is
true
that
such
souls
give
as
much
affection
it
may
be
more
than
those
who
surround
them
every
body
is
pleased
with
them
they
are
supposed
to
have
been
generous
when
the
truth
is
that
in
comparison
with
their
boundless
wealth
they
have
not
been
liberal
and
have
given
but
little
of
their
store
of
internal
treasure
the
habits
in
which
chopin
grew
up
in
which
he
was
rocked
as
in
a
cradle
were
those
peculiar
to
calm
occupied
and
tranquil
characters
these
early
examples
of
simplicity
piety
and
integrity
always
remained
the
nearest
and
dearest
to
him
domestic
virtues
religious
habits
pious
charities
and
rigid
modesty
surrounded
him
from
his
infancy
with
that
pure
atmosphere
in
which
his
rich
imagination
assumed
the
velvety
tenderness
characterizing
the
plants
which
have
never
been
exposed
to
the
dust
of
the
beaten
highways
he
commenced
the
study
of
music
at
an
early
age
being
but
nine
years
old
when
he
began
to
learn
it
shortly
after
he
was
confided
to
a
passionate
disciple
of
sebastian
bach
ziwna
who
directed
his
studies
during
many
years
in
accordance
with
the
most
classic
models
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
when
he
embraced
the
career
of
a
musician
any
prestige
of
vain
glory
any
fantastic
perspective
dazzled
his
eyes
or
excited
the
hopes
of
his
family
in
order
to
become
a
skillful
and
able
master
he
studied
seriously
and
conscientiously
without
dreaming
of
the
greater
or
less
amount
of
fame
he
would
be
able
to
obtain
as
the
fruit
of
his
lessons
and
assiduous
labors
in
consequence
of
the
generous
and
discriminating
protection
always
granted
by
prince
antoine
radziwill
to
the
arts
and
to
genius
which
he
had
the
power
of
recognizing
both
as
a
man
of
intellect
and
as
a
distinguished
artist
chopin
was
early
placed
in
one
of
the
first
colleges
in
warsaw
prince
radziwill
did
not
cultivate
music
only
as
a
simple
dilettante
he
was
also
a
remarkable
composer
his
beautiful
rendering
of
faust
published
some
years
ago
and
executed
at
fixed
epochs
by
the
academy
of
song
at
berlin
appears
to
us
far
superior
to
any
other
attempts
which
have
been
made
to
transport
it
into
the
realm
of
music
by
its
close
internal
appropriateness
to
the
peculiar
genius
of
the
poem
assisting
the
limited
means
of
the
family
of
chopin
the
prince
made
him
the
inestimable
gift
of
a
finished
education
of
which
no
part
had
been
neglected
through
the
person
of
a
friend
antoine
korzuchowski
whose
own
elevated
mind
enabled
him
to
understand
the
requirements
of
an
artistic
career
the
prince
always
paid
his
pension
from
his
first
entrance
into
college
until
the
completion
of
his
studies
from
this
time
until
the
death
of
chopin
antoine
korzuchowski
always
held
the
closest
relations
of
friendship
with
him
in
speaking
of
this
period
of
his
life
it
gives
us
pleasure
to
quote
the
charming
lines
which
may
be
applied
to
him
more
justly
than
other
pages
in
which
his
character
is
believed
to
have
been
traced
but
in
which
we
only
find
it
distorted
and
in
such
false
proportions
as
are
given
in
a
profile
drawn
upon
an
elastic
tissue
which
has
been
pulled
athwart
biased
by
contrary
movements
during
the
whole
progress
of
the
sketch
footnote
these
extracts
with
many
that
succeed
them
in
which
the
character
of
chopin
is
described
are
taken
from
lucrezia
floriani
a
novel
by
madame
sand
in
which
the
leading
characters
are
said
to
be
intended
to
represent
liszt
chopin
and
note
of
the
translator
gentle
sensitive
and
very
lovely
at
fifteen
years
of
age
he
united
the
charms
of
adolescence
with
the
gravity
of
a
more
mature
age
he
was
delicate
both
in
body
and
in
mind
through
the
want
of
muscular
development
he
retained
a
peculiar
beauty
an
exceptional
physiognomy
which
had
if
we
may
venture
so
to
speak
neither
age
nor
sex
it
was
not
the
bold
and
masculine
air
of
a
descendant
of
a
race
of
magnates
who
knew
nothing
but
drinking
hunting
and
making
war
neither
was
it
the
effeminate
loveliness
of
a
cherub
couleur
de
rose
it
was
more
like
the
ideal
creations
with
which
the
poetry
of
the
middle
ages
adorned
the
christian
temples
a
beautiful
angel
with
a
form
pure
and
slight
as
a
young
god
of
olympus
with
a
face
like
that
of
a
majestic
woman
filled
with
a
divine
sorrow
and
as
the
crown
of
all
an
expression
at
the
same
time
tender
and
severe
chaste
and
impassioned
this
expression
revealed
the
depths
of
his
being
nothing
could
be
purer
more
exalted
than
his
thoughts
nothing
more
tenacious
more
exclusive
more
intensely
devoted
than
his
affections
but
he
could
only
understand
that
which
closely
resembled
himself
every
thing
else
only
existed
for
him
as
a
kind
of
annoying
dream
which
he
tried
to
shake
off
while
living
with
the
rest
of
the
world
always
plunged
in
reveries
realities
displeased
him
as
a
child
he
could
never
touch
a
sharp
instrument
without
injuring
himself
with
it
as
a
man
he
never
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
being
different
from
himself
without
being
wounded
by
the
living
contradiction
he
was
preserved
from
constant
antagonism
by
a
voluntary
and
almost
inveterate
habit
of
never
seeing
or
hearing
any
thing
which
was
disagreeable
to
him
unless
it
touched
upon
his
personal
affections
the
beings
who
did
not
think
as
he
did
were
only
phantoms
in
his
eyes
as
his
manners
were
polished
and
graceful
it
was
easy
to
mistake
his
cold
disdain
on
insurmountable
aversion
for
benevolent
courtesy
he
never
spent
an
hour
in
expansiveness
without
compensating
for
it
by
a
season
of
reserve
the
moral
causes
which
induced
such
reserve
were
too
slight
too
subtle
to
be
discovered
by
the
naked
eye
it
was
necessary
to
use
the
microscope
to
read
his
soul
into
which
so
little
of
the
light
of
the
living
ever
penetrated
with
such
a
character
it
seems
strange
he
should
have
had
friends
yet
he
had
them
not
only
the
friends
of
his
mother
who
esteemed
him
as
the
noble
son
of
a
noble
mother
but
friends
of
his
own
age
who
loved
him
ardently
and
who
were
loved
by
him
in
return
he
had
formed
a
high
ideal
of
friendship
in
the
age
of
early
illusions
he
loved
to
think
that
his
friends
and
himself
brought
up
nearly
in
the
same
manner
with
the
same
principles
would
never
change
their
opinions
and
that
no
formal
disagreement
could
ever
occur
between
them
he
was
externally
so
affectionate
his
education
had
been
so
finished
and
he
possessed
so
much
natural
grace
that
he
had
the
gift
of
pleasing
even
where
he
was
not
personally
known
his
exceeding
loveliness
was
immediately
prepossessing
the
delicacy
of
his
constitution
rendered
him
interesting
in
the
eyes
of
women
the
full
yet
graceful
cultivation
of
his
mind
the
sweet
and
captivating
originality
of
his
conversation
gained
for
him
the
attention
of
the
most
enlightened
men
men
less
highly
cultivated
liked
him
for
his
exquisite
courtesy
of
manner
they
were
so
much
the
more
pleased
with
this
because
in
their
simplicity
they
never
imagined
it
was
the
graceful
fulfillment
of
a
duty
into
which
no
real
sympathy
entered
could
such
people
have
divined
the
secrets
of
his
mystic
character
they
would
have
said
he
was
more
amiable
than
loving
and
with
respect
to
them
this
would
have
been
true
but
how
could
they
have
known
that
his
real
though
rare
attachments
were
so
vivid
so
profound
so
undying
association
with
him
in
the
details
of
life
was
delightful
he
filled
all
the
forms
of
friendship
with
an
unaccustomed
charm
and
when
he
expressed
his
gratitude
it
was
with
that
deep
emotion
which
recompenses
kindness
with
usury
he
willingly
imagined
that
he
felt
himself
every
day
dying
he
accepted
the
cares
of
a
friend
hiding
from
him
lest
it
should
render
him
unhappy
the
little
time
he
expected
to
profit
by
them
he
possessed
great
physical
courage
and
if
he
did
not
accept
with
the
heroic
recklessness
of
youth
the
idea
of
approaching
death
at
least
he
cherished
the
expectation
of
it
with
a
kind
of
bitter
the
attachment
which
he
felt
for
a
young
lady
who
never
ceased
to
feel
a
reverential
homage
for
him
may
be
traced
back
to
his
early
youth
the
tempest
which
in
one
of
its
sudden
gusts
tore
chopin
from
his
native
soil
like
a
bird
dreamy
and
abstracted
surprised
by
the
storm
upon
the
branches
of
a
foreign
tree
sundered
the
ties
of
this
first
love
and
robbed
the
exile
of
a
faithful
and
devoted
wife
as
well
as
disinherited
him
of
a
country
he
never
found
the
realization
of
that
happiness
of
which
he
had
once
dreamed
with
her
though
he
won
the
glory
of
which
perhaps
he
had
never
thought
like
the
madonnas
of
luini
whose
looks
are
so
full
of
earnest
tenderness
this
young
girl
was
sweet
and
beautiful
she
lived
on
calm
but
sad
no
doubt
the
sadness
increased
in
that
pure
soul
when
she
knew
that
no
devotion
tender
as
her
own
ever
came
to
sweeten
the
existence
of
one
whom
she
had
adored
with
that
ingenuous
submission
that
exclusive
devotion
that
entire
naive
and
sublime
which
transform
the
woman
into
the
angel
those
who
are
gifted
by
nature
with
the
beautiful
yet
fatal
energies
of
genius
and
who
are
consequently
forbidden
to
sacrifice
the
care
of
their
glory
to
the
exactions
of
their
love
are
probably
right
in
fixing
limits
to
the
abnegation
of
their
own
personality
but
the
divine
emotions
due
to
absolute
devotion
may
be
regretted
even
in
the
presence
of
the
most
sparkling
endowments
of
genius
the
utter
submission
the
disinterestedness
of
love
in
absorbing
the
existence
the
will
the
very
name
of
the
woman
in
that
of
the
man
she
loves
can
alone
authorize
him
in
believing
that
he
has
really
shared
his
life
with
her
and
that
his
honorable
love
for
her
has
given
her
that
which
no
chance
lover
accidentally
met
could
have
rendered
her
peace
of
heart
and
the
honor
of
his
name
this
young
polish
lady
unfortunately
separated
from
chopin
remained
faithful
to
his
memory
to
all
that
was
left
of
him
she
devoted
herself
to
his
parents
the
father
of
chopin
would
never
suffer
the
portrait
which
she
had
drawn
of
him
in
the
days
of
hope
to
be
replaced
by
another
though
from
the
hands
of
a
far
more
skilful
artist
we
saw
the
pale
cheeks
of
this
melancholy
woman
glow
like
alabaster
when
a
light
shines
through
its
snow
many
years
afterwards
when
in
gazing
upon
this
picture
she
met
the
eyes
of
his
father
the
amiable
character
of
chopin
won
for
him
while
at
college
the
love
of
his
fellow
collegiates
particularly
that
of
prince
czetwertynski
and
his
brothers
he
often
spent
the
vacations
and
days
of
festival
with
them
at
the
house
of
their
mother
the
princess
louise
czetwertynska
who
cultivated
music
with
a
true
feeling
for
its
beauties
and
who
soon
discovered
the
poet
in
the
musician
perhaps
she
was
the
first
who
made
chopin
feel
the
charm
of
being
understood
as
well
as
heard
the
princess
was
still
beautiful
and
possessed
a
sympathetic
soul
united
to
many
high
qualities
her
saloon
was
one
of
the
most
brilliant
and
recherche
in
warsaw
chopin
often
met
there
the
most
distinguished
women
of
the
city
he
became
acquainted
there
with
those
fascinating
beauties
who
had
acquired
a
european
celebrity
when
warsaw
was
so
famed
for
the
brilliancy
elegance
and
grace
of
its
society
he
was
introduced
by
the
princess
czetwertynska
to
the
princess
of
lowicz
by
her
he
was
presented
to
the
countess
zamoyska
to
the
princess
radziwill
to
the
princess
jablonowska
enchantresses
surrounded
by
many
beauties
little
less
illustrious
while
still
very
young
he
has
often
cadenced
their
steps
to
the
chords
of
his
piano
in
these
meetings
which
might
almost
be
called
assemblies
of
fairies
he
may
often
have
discovered
unveiled
in
the
excitement
of
the
dance
the
secrets
of
enthusiastic
and
tender
souls
he
could
easily
read
the
hearts
which
were
attracted
to
him
by
friendship
and
the
grace
of
his
youth
and
thus
was
enabled
early
to
learn
of
what
a
strange
mixture
of
leaven
and
cream
of
roses
of
gunpowder
and
tears
of
angels
the
poetic
ideal
of
his
nation
is
formed
when
his
wandering
fingers
ran
over
the
keys
suddenly
touching
some
moving
chords
he
could
see
how
the
furtive
tears
coursed
down
the
cheeks
of
the
loving
girl
or
the
young
neglected
wife
how
they
moistened
the
eyes
of
the
young
men
enamored
of
and
eager
for
glory
can
we
not
fancy
some
young
beauty
asking
him
to
play
a
simple
prelude
then
softened
by
the
tones
leaning
her
rounded
arm
upon
the
instrument
to
support
her
dreaming
head
while
she
suffered
the
young
artist
to
divine
in
the
dewy
glitter
of
the
lustrous
eyes
the
song
sung
by
her
youthful
heart
did
not
groups
like
sportive
nymphs
throng
around
him
and
begging
him
for
some
waltz
of
giddying
rapidity
smile
upon
him
with
such
wildering
joyousness
as
to
put
him
immediately
in
unison
with
the
gay
spirit
of
the
dance
he
saw
there
the
chaste
grace
of
his
brilliant
countrywomen
displayed
in
the
mazourka
and
the
memories
of
their
witching
fascination
their
winning
reserve
were
never
effaced
from
his
soul
in
an
apparently
careless
manner
but
with
that
involuntary
and
subdued
emotion
which
accompanies
the
remembrance
of
our
early
delights
he
would
sometimes
remark
that
he
first
understood
the
whole
meaning
of
the
feeling
which
is
contained
in
the
melodies
and
rhythms
of
national
dances
upon
the
days
in
which
he
saw
these
exquisite
fairies
at
some
magic
fete
adorned
with
that
brilliant
coquetry
which
sparkles
like
electric
fire
and
flashing
from
heart
to
heart
heightens
love
blinds
it
or
robs
it
of
all
hope
and
when
the
muslins
of
india
which
the
greeks
would
have
said
were
woven
of
air
were
replaced
by
the
heavier
folds
of
venetian
velvet
and
the
perfumed
roses
and
sculptured
petals
of
the
camellias
gave
way
to
the
gorgeous
bouquets
of
the
jewel
caskets
it
often
seemed
to
him
that
however
good
the
orchestra
might
be
the
dancers
glided
less
rapidly
over
the
floor
that
their
laugh
was
less
sonorous
their
eye
less
luminous
than
upon
those
evenings
in
which
the
dance
had
been
suddenly
improvised
because
he
had
succeeded
in
electrifying
his
audience
through
the
magic
of
his
performance
if
he
electrified
them
it
was
because
he
repeated
truly
in
hieroglyphic
tones
but
yet
easily
understood
by
the
initiated
the
secret
whispers
which
his
delicate
ear
had
caught
from
the
reserved
yet
impassioned
hearts
which
indeed
resemble
the
fraxinella
that
plant
so
full
of
burning
and
vivid
life
that
its
flowers
are
always
surrounded
by
a
gas
as
subtle
as
inflammable
he
had
seen
celestial
visions
glitter
and
illusory
phantoms
fade
in
this
sublimated
air
he
had
divined
the
meaning
of
the
swarms
of
passions
which
are
forever
buzzing
in
it
he
knew
how
these
hurtling
emotions
fluttered
through
the
reckless
human
soul
how
notwithstanding
their
ceaseless
agitation
and
excitement
they
could
intermingle
interweave
intercept
each
other
without
once
disturbing
the
exquisite
proportions
of
external
grace
the
imposing
and
classic
charm
of
manner
it
was
thus
that
he
learned
to
prize
so
highly
the
noble
and
measured
manners
which
preserve
delicacy
from
insipidity
petty
cares
from
wearisome
trifling
conventionalism
from
tyranny
good
taste
from
coldness
and
which
never
permit
the
passions
to
resemble
as
is
often
the
case
where
such
careful
culture
does
not
rule
those
stony
and
calcareous
vegetables
whose
hard
and
brittle
growth
takes
a
name
of
such
sad
contrast
flowers
of
iron
flos
ferri
his
early
introduction
into
this
society
in
which
regularity
of
form
did
not
conceal
petrifaction
of
heart
induced
chopin
to
think
that
the
convenances
and
courtesies
of
manner
in
place
of
being
only
a
uniform
mask
repressing
the
character
of
each
individual
under
the
symmetry
of
the
same
lines
rather
serve
to
contain
the
passions
without
stifling
them
coloring
only
that
bald
crudity
of
tone
which
is
so
injurious
to
their
beauty
elevating
that
materialism
which
debases
them
robbing
them
of
that
license
which
vulgarizes
them
lowering
that
vehemence
which
vitiates
them
pruning
that
exuberance
which
exhausts
them
teaching
the
lovers
of
the
ideal
to
unite
the
virtues
which
have
sprung
from
a
knowledge
of
evil
with
those
which
cause
its
very
existence
to
be
forgotten
in
speaking
to
those
they
love
as
these
visions
of
his
youth
deepened
in
the
long
perspective
of
memories
they
gained
in
grace
in
charm
in
delight
in
his
eyes
fascinating
him
to
such
an
extent
that
no
reality
could
destroy
their
secret
power
over
his
imagination
rendering
his
repugnance
more
and
more
unconquerable
to
that
license
of
allurement
that
brutal
tyranny
of
caprice
that
eagerness
to
drink
the
cup
of
fantasy
to
the
very
dregs
that
stormy
pursuit
of
all
the
changes
and
incongruities
of
life
which
rule
in
the
strange
mode
of
life
known
as
la
boheme
more
than
once
in
the
history
of
art
and
literature
a
poet
has
arisen
embodying
in
himself
the
poetic
sense
of
a
whole
nation
an
entire
epoch
representing
the
types
which
his
contemporaries
pursue
and
strive
to
realize
in
an
absolute
manner
in
his
works
such
a
poet
was
chopin
for
his
country
and
for
the
epoch
in
which
he
was
born
the
poetic
sentiments
the
most
widely
spread
yet
the
most
intimate
and
inherent
of
his
nation
were
embodied
and
united
in
his
imagination
and
represented
by
his
brilliant
genius
poland
has
given
birth
to
many
bards
some
of
whom
rank
among
the
first
poets
of
the
world
its
writers
are
now
making
strenuous
efforts
to
display
in
the
strongest
light
the
most
glorious
and
interesting
facts
of
its
history
the
most
peculiar
and
picturesque
phases
of
its
manners
and
customs
chopin
differing
from
them
in
having
formed
no
premeditated
design
surpasses
them
all
in
originality
he
did
not
determine
upon
he
did
not
seek
such
a
result
he
created
no
ideal
a
priori
without
having
predetermined
to
transport
himself
into
the
past
he
constantly
remembered
the
glories
of
his
country
he
understood
and
sung
the
loves
and
tears
of
his
contemporaries
without
having
analyzed
them
in
advance
he
did
not
task
himself
nor
study
to
be
a
national
musician
like
all
truly
national
poets
he
sang
spontaneously
without
premeditated
design
or
preconceived
choice
all
that
inspiration
dictated
to
him
as
we
hear
it
gushing
forth
in
his
songs
without
labor
almost
without
effort
he
repeated
in
the
most
idealized
form
the
emotions
which
had
animated
and
embellished
his
youth
under
the
magic
delicacy
of
his
pen
he
displayed
the
ideal
which
is
if
we
may
be
permitted
so
to
speak
the
real
among
his
people
an
ideal
really
in
existence
among
them
which
every
one
in
general
and
each
one
in
particular
approaches
by
the
one
or
the
other
of
its
many
sides
without
assuming
to
do
so
he
collected
in
luminous
sheaves
the
impressions
felt
everywhere
throughout
his
country
vaguely
felt
it
is
true
yet
in
fragments
pervading
all
hearts
is
it
not
by
this
power
of
reproducing
in
a
poetic
formula
enchanting
to
the
imagination
of
all
nations
the
indefinite
shades
of
feeling
widely
scattered
but
frequently
met
among
their
compatriots
that
the
artists
truly
national
are
distinguished
not
without
reason
has
the
task
been
undertaken
of
collecting
the
melodies
indigenous
to
every
country
it
appears
to
us
it
would
be
of
still
deeper
interest
to
trace
the
influences
forming
the
characteristic
powers
of
the
authors
most
deeply
inspired
by
the
genius
of
the
nation
to
which
they
belong
until
the
present
epoch
there
have
been
very
few
distinctive
compositions
which
stand
out
from
the
two
great
divisions
of
the
german
and
italian
schools
of
music
but
with
the
immense
development
which
this
art
seems
destined
to
attain
perhaps
renewing
for
us
the
glorious
era
of
the
painters
of
the
cinque
cento
it
is
highly
probable
that
composers
will
appear
whose
works
will
be
marked
by
an
originality
drawn
from
differences
of
organization
of
races
and
of
climates
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
we
will
be
able
to
recognize
the
influences
of
the
country
in
which
they
were
born
upon
the
great
masters
in
music
as
well
as
in
the
other
arts
that
we
will
be
able
to
distinguish
the
peculiar
and
predominant
traits
of
the
national
genius
more
completely
developed
more
poetically
true
more
interesting
to
study
in
the
pages
of
their
compositions
than
in
the
crude
incorrect
uncertain
vague
and
tremulous
sketches
of
the
uncultured
people
chopin
must
be
ranked
among
the
first
musicians
thus
individualizing
in
themselves
the
poetic
sense
of
an
entire
nation
not
because
he
adopted
the
rhythm
of
polonaises
mazourkas
and
cracoviennes
and
called
many
of
his
works
by
such
names
for
in
so
doing
he
would
have
limited
himself
to
the
multiplication
of
such
works
alone
and
would
always
have
given
us
the
same
mode
the
remembrance
of
the
same
thing
a
reproduction
which
would
soon
have
grown
wearisome
serving
but
to
multiply
compositions
of
similar
form
which
must
have
soon
grown
more
or
less
monotonous
it
is
because
he
filled
these
forms
with
the
feelings
peculiar
to
his
country
because
the
expression
of
the
national
heart
may
be
found
under
all
the
modes
in
which
he
has
written
that
he
is
entitled
to
be
considered
a
poet
essentially
polish
his
preludes
his
nocturnes
his
scherzos
his
concertos
his
shortest
as
well
as
his
longest
compositions
are
all
filled
with
the
national
sensibility
expressed
indeed
in
different
degrees
modified
and
varied
in
a
thousand
ways
but
always
bearing
the
same
character
an
eminently
subjective
author
chopin
has
given
the
same
life
to
all
his
productions
animated
all
his
works
with
his
own
spirit
all
his
writings
are
thus
linked
by
a
marked
unity
their
beauties
as
well
as
their
defects
may
be
traced
to
the
same
order
of
emotions
to
peculiar
modes
of
feeling
the
reproduction
of
the
feelings
of
his
people
idealized
and
elevated
through
his
own
subjective
genius
is
an
essential
requisite
for
the
national
poet
who
desires
that
the
heart
of
his
country
should
vibrate
in
unison
with
his
own
strains
by
the
analogies
of
words
and
images
we
should
like
to
render
it
possible
for
our
readers
to
comprehend
the
exquisite
yet
irritable
sensibility
peculiar
to
ardent
yet
susceptible
hearts
to
haughty
yet
deeply
wounded
souls
we
can
not
flatter
ourselves
that
in
the
cold
realm
of
words
we
have
been
able
to
give
any
idea
of
such
ethereal
odorous
flames
in
comparison
with
the
vivid
and
delicious
excitement
produced
by
other
arts
words
always
appear
poor
cold
and
arid
so
that
the
assertion
seems
just
that
of
all
modes
of
expressing
sentiments
words
are
the
most
insufficient
we
can
not
flatter
ourselves
with
having
attained
in
our
descriptions
the
exceeding
delicacy
of
touch
necessary
to
sketch
that
which
chopin
has
painted
with
hues
so
ethereal
all
is
subtle
in
his
compositions
even
the
source
of
excitement
of
passion
all
open
frank
primitive
impressions
disappear
in
them
before
they
meet
the
eye
they
have
passed
through
the
prism
of
an
exacting
ingenious
and
fertile
imagination
and
it
has
become
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
resolve
them
again
into
their
primal
elements
acuteness
of
discernment
is
required
to
understand
delicacy
to
describe
them
in
seizing
such
refined
impressions
with
the
keenest
discrimination
in
embodying
them
with
infinite
art
chopin
has
proved
himself
an
artist
of
the
highest
order
it
is
only
after
long
and
patient
study
after
having
pursued
his
sublimated
ideas
through
their
multiform
ramifications
that
we
learn
to
admire
sufficiently
to
comprehend
aright
the
genius
with
which
he
has
rendered
his
subtle
thoughts
visible
and
palpable
without
once
blunting
their
edge
or
ever
congealing
their
fiery
flow
he
was
so
entirely
filled
with
the
sentiments
whose
most
perfect
types
he
believed
he
had
known
in
his
own
youth
with
the
ideas
which
it
alone
pleased
him
to
confide
to
art
he
contemplated
art
so
invariably
from
the
same
point
of
view
that
his
artistic
preferences
could
not
fail
to
be
influenced
by
his
early
impressions
in
the
great
models
and
he
only
sought
that
which
was
in
correspondence
with
his
own
soul
that
which
stood
in
relation
to
it
pleased
him
that
which
resembled
it
not
scarcely
obtained
justice
from
him
uniting
in
himself
the
frequently
incompatible
qualities
of
passion
and
grace
he
possessed
great
accuracy
of
judgment
and
preserved
himself
from
all
petty
partiality
but
he
was
but
slightly
attracted
by
the
greatest
beauties
the
highest
merits
when
they
wounded
any
of
the
phases
of
his
poetic
conceptions
notwithstanding
the
high
admiration
which
he
entertained
for
the
works
of
beethoven
certain
portions
of
them
always
seemed
to
him
too
rudely
sculptured
their
structure
was
too
athletic
to
please
him
their
wrath
seemed
to
him
too
tempestuous
their
passion
too
overpowering
the
which
fills
every
member
of
his
phases
was
matter
too
substantial
for
his
tastes
and
the
raphaelic
and
seraphic
profiles
which
are
wrought
into
the
midst
of
the
nervous
and
powerful
creations
of
this
great
genius
were
to
him
almost
painful
from
the
force
of
the
cutting
contrast
in
which
they
are
frequently
set
in
spite
of
the
charm
which
he
acknowledged
in
some
of
the
melodies
of
schubert
he
would
not
willingly
listen
to
those
in
which
the
contours
were
too
sharp
for
his
ear
in
which
suffering
lies
naked
and
we
can
almost
feel
the
flesh
palpitate
and
hear
the
bones
crack
and
crash
under
the
rude
embrace
of
sorrow
all
savage
wildness
was
repulsive
to
him
in
music
in
literature
in
the
conduct
of
life
all
that
approached
the
melodramatic
was
painful
to
him
the
frantic
and
despairing
aspects
of
exaggerated
romanticism
were
repellent
to
him
he
could
not
endure
the
struggling
for
wonderful
effects
for
delicious
excesses
he
loved
shakspeare
only
under
many
conditions
he
thought
his
characters
were
drawn
too
closely
to
the
life
and
spoke
a
language
too
true
he
preferred
the
epic
and
lyric
syntheses
which
leave
the
poor
details
of
humanity
in
the
shade
for
the
same
reason
he
spoke
little
and
listened
less
not
wishing
to
give
expression
to
his
own
thoughts
or
to
receive
the
thoughts
of
others
until
after
they
had
attained
a
certain
degree
of
elevation
a
nature
so
completely
master
of
itself
so
full
of
delicate
reserve
which
loved
to
divine
through
glimpses
presentiments
suppositions
all
that
had
been
left
untold
a
species
of
divination
always
dear
to
poets
who
can
so
eloquently
finish
the
interrupted
words
must
have
felt
annoyed
almost
scandalized
by
an
audacity
which
leaves
nothing
unexpressed
nothing
to
be
divined
if
he
had
been
called
upon
to
express
his
own
views
upon
this
subject
we
believe
he
would
have
confessed
that
in
accordance
with
his
taste
he
was
only
permitted
to
give
vent
to
his
feelings
on
condition
of
suffering
much
to
remain
unrevealed
or
only
to
be
divined
under
the
rich
veils
of
broidery
in
which
he
wound
his
emotions
if
that
which
they
agree
in
calling
classic
in
art
appeared
to
him
too
full
of
methodical
restrictions
if
he
refused
to
permit
himself
to
be
garroted
in
the
manacles
and
frozen
in
the
conventions
of
systems
if
he
did
not
like
confinement
although
enclosed
in
the
safe
symmetry
of
a
gilded
cage
it
was
not
because
he
preferred
the
license
of
disorder
the
confusion
of
irregularity
it
was
rather
that
he
might
soar
like
the
lark
into
the
deep
blue
of
the
unclouded
heavens
like
the
bird
of
paradise
which
it
was
once
thought
never
slept
but
while
resting
upon
extended
wing
rocked
only
by
the
breath
of
unlimited
space
at
the
sublime
height
at
which
it
reposed
he
obstinately
refused
to
descend
to
bury
himself
in
the
misty
gloom
of
the
forests
or
to
surround
himself
with
the
howlings
and
wailings
with
which
it
is
filled
he
would
not
leave
the
depths
of
azure
for
the
wastes
of
the
desert
or
attempt
to
fix
pathways
over
the
treacherous
waves
of
sand
which
the
winds
in
exulting
irony
delight
to
sweep
over
the
traces
of
the
rash
mortal
seeking
to
mark
the
line
of
his
wandering
through
the
drifting
blinding
swells
that
style
of
italian
art
which
is
so
open
so
glaring
so
devoid
of
the
attraction
of
mystery
or
of
science
with
all
that
which
in
german
art
bears
the
seal
of
vulgar
though
powerful
energy
was
distasteful
to
him
apropos
of
schubert
he
once
remarked
that
the
sublime
is
desecrated
when
followed
by
the
trivial
or
commonplace
among
the
composers
for
the
piano
hummel
was
one
of
the
authors
whom
he
reread
with
the
most
pleasure
mozart
was
in
his
eyes
the
ideal
type
the
poet
par
excellence
because
he
less
rarely
than
any
other
author
condescended
to
descend
the
steps
leading
from
the
beautiful
to
the
commonplace
the
father
of
mozart
after
having
been
present
at
a
representation
of
idomenee
made
to
his
son
the
following
reproach
you
have
been
wrong
in
putting
in
it
nothing
for
the
long
ears
it
was
precisely
for
such
omissions
that
chopin
admired
him
the
gayety
of
papageno
charmed
him
the
love
of
tamino
with
its
mysterious
trials
seemed
to
him
worthy
of
having
occupied
mozart
he
understood
the
vengeance
of
donna
anna
because
it
cast
but
a
deeper
shade
upon
her
mourning
yet
such
was
his
sybaritism
of
purity
his
dread
of
the
commonplace
that
even
in
this
immortal
work
he
discovered
some
passages
whose
introduction
we
have
heard
him
regret
his
worship
for
mozart
was
not
diminished
but
only
saddened
by
this
he
could
sometimes
forget
that
which
was
repulsive
to
him
but
to
reconcile
himself
to
it
was
impossible
he
seemed
to
be
governed
in
this
by
one
of
those
implacable
and
irrational
instincts
which
no
persuasion
no
effort
can
ever
conquer
sufficiently
to
obtain
a
state
of
mere
indifference
towards
the
objects
of
the
antipathy
an
aversion
sometimes
so
insurmountable
that
we
can
only
account
for
it
by
supposing
it
to
proceed
from
some
innate
and
peculiar
idiosyncrasy
after
he
had
finished
his
studies
in
harmony
with
professor
joseph
elsner
who
taught
him
the
rarely
known
and
difficult
task
of
being
exacting
towards
himself
and
placing
the
just
value
upon
the
advantages
which
are
only
to
be
obtained
by
dint
of
patience
and
labor
and
after
he
had
finished
his
collegiate
course
it
was
the
desire
of
his
parents
that
he
should
travel
in
order
that
he
might
become
familiar
with
the
finest
works
under
the
advantage
of
their
perfect
execution
for
this
purpose
he
visited
many
of
the
german
cities
he
had
left
warsaw
upon
one
of
these
short
excursions
when
the
revolution
of
the
of
november
broke
out
in
forced
to
remain
in
vienna
he
was
heard
there
in
some
concerts
but
the
viennese
public
generally
so
cultivated
so
prompt
to
seize
the
most
delicate
shades
of
execution
the
finest
subtleties
of
thought
during
this
winter
were
disturbed
and
abstracted
the
young
artist
did
not
produce
there
the
effect
he
had
the
right
to
anticipate
he
left
vienna
with
the
design
of
going
to
london
but
he
came
first
to
paris
where
he
intended
to
remain
but
a
short
time
upon
his
passport
drawn
up
for
england
he
had
caused
to
be
inserted
passing
through
paris
these
words
sealed
his
fate
long
years
afterwards
when
he
seemed
not
only
acclimated
but
naturalized
in
france
he
would
smilingly
say
i
am
passing
through
paris
he
gave
several
concerts
after
his
arrival
in
paris
where
he
was
immediately
received
and
admired
in
the
circles
of
the
elite
as
well
as
welcomed
by
the
young
artists
we
remember
his
first
appearance
in
the
saloons
of
pleyel
where
the
most
enthusiastic
and
redoubled
applause
seemed
scarcely
sufficient
to
express
our
enchantment
for
the
genius
which
had
revealed
new
phases
of
poetic
feeling
and
made
such
happy
yet
bold
innovations
in
the
form
of
musical
art
unlike
the
greater
part
of
young
debutants
he
was
not
intoxicated
or
dazzled
for
a
moment
by
his
triumph
but
accepted
it
without
pride
or
false
modesty
evincing
none
of
the
puerile
enjoyment
of
gratified
vanity
exhibited
by
the
parvenus
of
success
his
countrymen
who
were
then
in
paris
gave
him
a
most
affectionate
reception
he
was
intimate
in
the
house
of
prince
czartoryski
of
the
countess
plater
of
madame
de
komar
and
in
that
of
her
daughters
the
princess
de
beauveau
and
the
countess
delphine
potocka
whose
beauty
together
with
her
indescribable
and
spiritual
grace
made
her
one
of
the
most
admired
sovereigns
of
the
society
of
paris
he
dedicated
to
her
his
second
concerto
which
contains
the
adagio
we
have
already
described
the
ethereal
beauty
of
the
countess
her
enchanting
voice
enchained
him
by
a
fascination
full
of
respectful
admiration
her
voice
was
destined
to
be
the
last
which
should
vibrate
upon
the
musician
heart
perhaps
the
sweetest
sounds
of
earth
accompanied
the
parting
soul
until
they
blended
in
his
ear
with
the
first
chords
of
the
angels
lyres
he
mingled
much
with
the
polish
circle
in
paris
with
orda
who
seemed
born
to
command
the
future
and
who
was
however
killed
in
algiers
at
twenty
years
of
age
with
counts
plater
grzymala
ostrowski
szembeck
with
prince
lubomirski
etc
etc
as
the
polish
families
who
came
afterwards
to
paris
were
all
anxious
to
form
acquaintance
with
him
he
continued
to
mingle
principally
with
his
own
people
he
remained
through
them
not
only
au
courant
of
all
that
was
passing
in
his
own
country
but
even
in
a
kind
of
musical
correspondence
with
it
he
liked
those
who
visited
paris
to
show
him
the
airs
or
new
songs
they
had
brought
with
them
and
when
the
words
of
these
airs
pleased
him
he
frequently
wrote
a
new
melody
for
them
thus
popularizing
them
rapidly
in
his
country
although
the
name
of
their
author
was
often
unknown
the
number
of
these
melodies
due
to
the
inspiration
of
the
heart
alone
having
become
considerable
he
often
thought
of
collecting
them
for
publication
but
he
thought
of
it
too
late
and
they
remain
scattered
and
dispersed
like
the
perfume
of
the
scented
flowers
blessing
the
wilderness
and
sweetening
the
desert
air
around
some
wandering
traveller
whom
chance
may
have
led
upon
their
secluded
track
during
our
stay
in
poland
we
heard
some
of
the
melodies
which
are
attributed
to
him
and
which
are
truly
worthy
of
him
but
who
would
now
dare
to
make
an
uncertain
selection
between
the
inspirations
of
the
national
poet
and
the
dreams
of
his
people
chopin
kept
for
a
long
time
aloof
from
the
celebrities
of
paris
their
glittering
train
repelled
him
as
his
character
and
habits
had
more
true
originality
than
apparent
eccentricity
he
inspired
less
curiosity
than
they
did
besides
he
had
sharp
repartees
for
those
who
imprudently
wished
to
force
him
into
a
display
of
his
musical
abilities
upon
one
occasion
after
he
had
just
left
the
an
indiscreet
host
who
had
had
the
simplicity
to
promise
his
guests
some
piece
executed
by
him
as
a
rare
dessert
pointed
to
him
an
open
piano
he
should
have
remembered
that
in
counting
without
the
host
it
is
necessary
to
count
twice
chopin
at
first
refused
but
wearied
at
last
by
continued
persecution
assuming
to
sharpen
the
sting
of
his
words
a
stifled
and
languid
tone
of
voice
he
exclaimed
ah

cold
water
colors

have
seemed
without
doubt
dull
to
madame
sand
after
having
handled
the
hammer
and
chisel
of
the
sculptor
so
boldly
in
modeling
the
grand
lines
of
that
statue
in
cutting
those
sinewy
muscles
which
even
in
their
statuesque
immobility
are
full
of
bewildering
and
seductive
charm

we
continue

painful

strong
contrast

the
miracle

pygmalion
lelia

a
living
galatea
rich
in
feeling
full
of
love
whom
the
deeply
enamored
artist
has
tried
to
bury
alive
in
his
exquisitely
sculptured
marble
stifling
the
palpitating
breath
and
congealing
the
warm
blood
in
the
vain
hope
of
elevating
and
immortalizing
the
beauty
he
adores
in
the
presence
of
this
vivid
nature
petrified
by
art
we
can
not
feel
that
admiration
is
kindled
into
love
but
saddened
and
chilled
we
are
forced
to
acknowledge
that
love
may
be
frozen
into
mere
admiration

never

after
having
blunted
her

polishing

by
its
majesty
its
haughty

its
look
of
hopeless
anguish
shadowed
by
the
frowning
of
the
pure
brows
and
by
the
long
loose
locks
shivering
with
electric
life
reminds
us
of
those
antique
cameos
on
which
we
still
admire
the
perfect
features
the
beautiful
yet
fatal
brow
the
haughty
smile
of
the
medusa
whose
gaze
paralyzed
and
stopped
the
pulses
of
the
human
heart
madame
sand
in
vain
sought
another
form
for
the
expression
of
the
emotions
which
tortured
her
insatiate
soul
after
having
draped
this
figure
with
the
highest
art
accumulating
every
species
of
masculine
greatness
upon
it
in
order
to
compensate
for
the
highest
of
all
qualities
which
she
repudiated
for
it
the
grandeur
of
utter
for
love
which
the
poet
has
placed
in
the
empyrean
and
called
the
eternal
feminine
das
ewigweibliche
a
greatness
which
is
love
existing
before
any
of
its
joys
surviving
all
its
sorrows
after
having
caused
don
juan
to
be
cursed
and
a
divine
hymn
to
be
chanted
to
desire
by
lelia
who
as
well
as
don
juan
had
repulsed
the
only
delight

the
luxury

having
fully
revenged
elvira

the
creation
of

having
scorned

than

degraded

madame
sand
in
her
lettres
voyageur
depicts
the
shivering
palsy
the
painful
lethargy
which
seizes
the
artist
when
having
incorporated
the
emotion
which
inspired
him
in
his
work
his
imagination
still
remains
under
the
domination
of
the
insatiate
idea
without
being
able
to
find
another
form
in
which
to
incarnate
it
such
poetic
sufferings
were
well
understood
by
byron
when
he
makes
tasso
shed
his
most
bitter
tears
not
for
his
chains
not
for
his
physical
sufferings
not
for
the
ignominy
heaped
upon
him
but
for
his
finished
epic
for
the
ideal
world
created
by
his
thought
and
now
about
to
close
its
doors
upon
him
and
by
thus
expelling
him
from
its
enchanted
realm
rendering
him
at
last
sensible
of
the
gloomy
realities
around
him
but
this
is
my
pleasant
task
is
done
my
friend
of
many
years
if
i
do
blot
thy
final
page
with
tears
know
that
my
sorrows
have
wrung
from
me
none
but
thou
my
young
creation
my
soul
child
which
ever
playing
round
me
came
and
smiled
and
woo
me
from
myself
with
thy
sweet
sight
thou
too
art
gone
and
so
is
my
delight
lament
of
byron
at
this
epoch
madame
sand
often
heard
a
musician
one
of
the
friends
who
had
greeted
chopin
with
the
most
enthusiastic
joy
upon
his
arrival
at
paris
speak
of
him
she
heard
him
praise
his
poetic
genius
even
more
than
his
artistic
talent
she
was
acquainted
with
his
compositions
and
admired
their
graceful
tenderness
she
was
struck
by
the
amount
of
emotion
displayed
in
his
poems
with
the
effusions
of
a
heart
so
noble
and
dignified
some
of
the
countrymen
of
chopin
spoke
to
her
of
the
women
of
their
country
with
the
enthusiasm
natural
to
them
upon
that
subject
an
enthusiasm
then
very
much
increased
by
a
remembrance
of
the
sublime
sacrifices
made
by
them
during
the
last
war
through
their
recitals
and
the
poetic
inspiration
of
the
polish
artist
she
perceived
an
ideal
of
love
which
took
the
form
of
worship
for
woman
she
thought
that
guaranteed
from
dependence
preserved
from
inferiority
her
role
might
be
like
the
fairy
power
of
the
peri
that
ethereal
intelligence
and
friend
of
man
perhaps
she
did
not
fully
understand
what
innumerable
links
of
suffering
of
silence
of
patience
of
gentleness
of
indulgence
of
courageous
perseverance
had
been
necessary
for
the
formation
of
the
worship
for
this
imperious
but
resigned
ideal
beautiful
indeed
but
sad
to
behold
like
those
plants
with
the
corollas
whose
stems
intertwining
and
interlacing
in
a
network
of
long
and
numerous
branches
give
life
to
ruins
destined
ever
to
embellish
decay
growing
upon
old
walls
and
hiding
only
tottering
stones
beautiful
veils
woven
by
beneficent
nature
in
her
ingenious
and
inexhaustible
richness
to
cover
the
constant
decay
of
human
things
as
madame
sand
perceived
that
this
artist
in
place
of
giving
body
to
his
phantasy
in
porphyry
and
marble
or
defining
his
thoughts
by
the
creation
of
massive
caryatides
rather
effaced
the
contour
of
his
works
and
had
it
been
necessary
could
have
elevated
his
architecture
itself
from
the
soil
to
suspend
it
like
the
floating
palaces
of
the
fata
morgana
in
the
fleecy
clouds
through
his
aerial
forms
of
almost
impalpable
buoyancy
she
was
more
and
more
attracted
by
that
mystic
ideal
which
she
perceived
glowing
within
them
though
her
arm
was
powerful
enough
to
have
sculptured
the
round
shield
her
hand
was
delicate
enough
to
have
traced
those
light
relievos
where
the
shadows
of
ineffaceable
profiles
have
been
thrown
upon
and
trusted
to
a
stone
scarcely
raised
from
its
level
plane
she
was
no
stranger
in
the
supernatural
world
she
to
whom
nature
as
to
a
favored
child
had
unloosed
her
girdle
and
unveiled
all
the
caprices
the
attractions
the
delights
which
she
can
lend
to
beauty
she
was
not
ignorant
of
the
lightest
graces
she
whose
eye
could
embrace
such
vast
proportions
had
stooped
to
study
the
glowing
illuminations
painted
upon
the
wings
of
the
fragile
butterfly
she
had
traced
the
symmetrical
and
marvellous
network
which
the
fern
extends
as
a
canopy
over
the
wood
strawberry
she
had
listened
to
the
murmuring
of
streams
through
the
long
reeds
and
stems
of
the
where
the
hissing
of
the
amorous
viper
may
be
heard
she
had
followed
the
wild
leaps
of
the
as
it
bounds
over
the
surface
of
the
meadows
and
marshes
she
had
pictured
to
herself
the
chimerical
toward
which
it
perfidiously
attracts
the
benighted
traveller
she
had
listened
to
the
concerts
given
by
the
cicada
and
their
friends
in
the
stubble
of

there
disappear
like

the
stars
fall
one
by

into

of

yawning
abyss

depths
no

has
ever
sounded
while
the
soul
contemplating
these

this

with
its

and
perishing
oases
is
stricken
by
a
grief
so
hopeless
so
profound
that
neither
enthusiasm
nor
love
can
ever
soothe
it
more
it
ingulfs
and
absorbs
all
emotions
being
no
more
agitated
by
them
than
the
sleeping
waters
of
some
tranquil
lake
reflecting
the
moving
images

banks
from

surface

by

upon

the

is
strained
above

the
insufficiency
of

is
felt
for
the
first
time
by
those
who
have
studied
it
so
much
and
used
it
so
well
we
are
borne
from
all
active
from
all
militant
instincts
to
travel
through
boundless
space
to
be
lost
in
the
immensity
of
adventurous
courses
far
far
above
the
clouds
where
we
no
longer
see
that
the
earth
is
beautiful
because
our
gaze
is
riveted
upon
the
skies
where
reality
is
no
longer
poetically
draped
as
has
been
so
skilfully
done
by
the
author
of
waverley
but
where
in
idealizing
poetry
itself
the
infinite
is
peopled
with
the
spirits
belonging
only
to
its
mystic
realm
as
has
been
done
by
byron
in
his
manfred
could
madame
sand
have
divined
the
incurable
melancholy
the
will
which
can
not
blend
with
that
of
others
the
imperious
exclusiveness
which
invariably
seize
upon
imaginations
delighting
in
the
pursuit
of
dreams
whose
realities
are
nowhere
to
be
found

at

never
in
the

in
which
the
dreamers
are
constrained
to
dwell
had
she
foreseen
the
form
which
devoted
attachment
assumes
for
such
dreamers
had
she
measured
the
entire
and
absolute
absorption
which
they
will
alone
accept
as
the
synonyme
of
tenderness
it
is
necessary
to
be
in
some
degree
shy
shrinking
and
secretive
as
they
themselves
are
to
be
able
to
understand
the
hidden
depths
of
characters
so
concentrated
like
those
susceptible
flowers
which
close
their
sensitive
petals
before
the
first
breath
of
the
north
wind
they
too
veil
their
exacting
souls
in
the
shrouds
of
self
concentration
unfolding
themselves
only
under
the
warming
rays
of
a
propitious
sun
such
natures
have
been
called
rich
by
exclusiveness
in
opposition
to
those
which
are
rich
by
expansiveness
if
these
differing
temperaments
should
meet
and
approach
each
other
they
can
never
mingle
or
melt
the
one
into
the
other
says
the
writer
whom
we
have
so
often
quoted
but
the
one
must
consume
the
other
leaving
nothing
but
ashes
behind
alas
it
is
the
natures
like
that
of
the
fragile
musician
whose
days
we
commemorate
which
consuming
themselves
perish

wishing
not
indeed
being
able
to
live
any
life

one

conformity

their
own
exclusive
ideal

seemed
to
dread
madame
sand
more
than
any
other
woman
the
modern
sibyl
who
like
the
pythoness
of
old
had
said
so
many
things
that
others
of
her
sex
neither
knew
nor
dared
to
say
he
avoided
and
put
off
all
introduction
to
her
madame
sand
was
ignorant
of
this
in
consequence
of
that
captivating
simplicity
which
is
one
of
her
noblest
charms
she
did
not
divine
his
fear
of
the
delphic
priestess
at
last
she
was
presented
to
him
and
an
acquaintance
with
her
soon
dissipated
the
prejudices
which
he
had
obstinately
nourished
against
female
authors
in
the
fall
of
chopin
was
attacked
by
an
alarming
illness
which
left
him
almost
without
force
to
support
life
dangerous
symptoms
forced
him
to
go
south
to
avoid
the
rigor
of
winter
madame
sand
always
so
watchful
over
those
whom
she
loved
so
full
of
compassion
for
their
sufferings
would
not
permit
him
when
his
health
required
so
much
care
to
set
out
alone
and
determined
to
accompany
him
they
selected
the
island
of
majorca
for
their
residence
because
the
air
of
the
sea
joined
to
the
mild
climate
which
prevails
there
is
especially
salubrious
for
those
who
are
suffering
from
affections
of
the
lungs
though
he
was
so
weak
when
he
left
paris
that
we
had
no
hope
of
his
ever
returning
though
after
his
arrival
in
majorca
he
was
long
and
dangerously
ill
yet
so
much
was
he
benefited
by
the
change
that
big
health
was
improved
during
several
years
was
it
the
effect
of
the
balmy
climate
alone
which
recalled
him
to
health
was
it
not
rather
because
his
life
was
full
of
bliss
that
he
found
strength
to
live
did
he
not
regain
strength
only
because
he
now
wished
to
live
who
can
tell
how
far
the
influence
of
the
will
extends
over
the
body
who
knows
what
internal
subtle
aroma
it
has
the
power
of
disengaging
to
preserve
the
sinking
frame
from
decay
what
vital
force
it
can
breathe
into
the
debilitated
organs
who
can
say
where
the
dominion
of
mind
over
matter
ceases
who
knows
how
far
our
senses
are
under
the
dominion
of
the
imagination
to
what
extent
their
powers
may
be
increased
or
their
extinction
accelerated
by
its
influence
it
matters
not
how
the
imagination
gains
its
strange
extension
of
power
whether
through
long
and
bitter
exercise
or
whether
spontaneously
collecting
its
forgotten
strength
it
concentrates
its
force
in
some
new
and
decisive
moment
of
destiny
as
when
the
rays
of
the
sun
are
able
to
kindle
a
flame
of
celestial
origin
when
concentrated
in
the
focus
of
the
burning
glass
brittle
and
fragile
though
the
medium
be
all
the
long
scattered
rays
of
happiness
were
collected
within
this
epoch
of
the
life
of
chopin
is
it
then
surprising
that
they
should
have
rekindled
the
flame
of
life
and
that
it
should
have
burned
at
this
time
with
the
most
vivid
lustre
the
solitude
surrounded
by
the
blue
waves
of
the
mediterranean
and
shaded
by
groves
of
orange
seemed
fitted
in
its
exceeding
loveliness
for
the
ardent
vows
of
youthful
lovers
still
believing
in
their
naive
and
sweet
illusions
sighing
for
happiness
in
some
desert
isle
he
breathed
there
that
air
for
which
natures
unsuited
for
the
world
and
never
feeling
themselves
happy
in
it
long
with
such
a
painful
that
air
which
may
be
found
everywhere
if
we
can
find
the
sympathetic
souls
to
breathe
it
with
us
and
which
is
to
be
met
nowhere
without
them
that
air
of
the
land
of
our
dreams
and
which
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
of
the
bitter
real
is
easily
discovered
when
sought
by
two
it
is
the
air
of
the
country
of
the
ideal
to
which
we
gladly
entice
the
being

its
intensity

remained
faithful

her
even
after
all
its

and
consumed

the
strength

his
affection

their
attachments
when
they
no

find
it
the
attachment
gently
vanishes
in
this

resemble
the
rest
of
the
world
but
he
loved
for
the
sake
of
loving
no
amount
of
suffering
was
sufficient
to
discourage
him
he
could
enter
upon
a
new
phase
that
of
woe
but
the
phase
of
coldness
he
could
never
arrive
at
it
would
have
been

a
phase
of
physical
agony
for
his
love

his

although

was

moment

assign
the

tranquillity
like

he

a

has

was

in

visibly
declined
during
some
years
his
most
tranquil
hours
were
spent
at
nohant
where
he
seemed
to
suffer
less
than
elsewhere
he
composed
there
with
pleasure
bringing
with
him
every
year
to
paris
several
new
compositions
but
every
winter
caused
him
an
increase
of
suffering
motion
became
at
first
difficult
and
soon
almost
impossible
to
him
from
to
he
scarcely
walked
at
all
he
could
not
ascend
the
staircase
without
the
most
painful
sensation
of
suffocation
and
his
life
was
only
prolonged
through
continual
care
and
the
greatest
precaution
towards
the
spring
of
as
his
health
grew
more
precarious
from
day
to
day
he
was
attacked
by
an
illness
from
which
it
was
thought
he
could
never
recover
he
was
saved
for
the
last
time
but
this
epoch
was
marked
by
an
event
so
agonizing
to
his
heart
that
he
immediately
called
it
mortal
indeed
he
did
not
long
survive
the
rupture
of
his
friendship
with
madame
sand
which
took
place
at
this
date
madame
de
stael
who
in
spite
of
her
generous
and
impassioned
heart
her
subtle
and
vivid
intellect
fell
sometimes
into
the
fault
of
making
her
sentences
heavy
through
a
species
of
pedantry
which
robbed
them
of
the
grace
of
abandon
remarked
on
one
of
those
occasions
when
the
strength
of
her
feelings
made
her
forget
the
solemnity
of
her
genevese
stiffness
in
affection
there
are
only
beginnings
this
exclamation
was
based
upon
the
bitter
experience
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
human
heart
to
accomplish
the
beautiful
and
blissful
dreams
of
the
imagination
ah
if
some
blessed
examples
of
human
devotion
did
not
sometimes
occur
to
contradict
the
melancholy
words
of
madame
de
stael
which
so
many
illustrious
as
well
as
obscure
facts
seem
to
prove
our
suspicions
might
lead
us
to
be
guilty
of
much
ingratitude
and
want
of
trust
we
might
be
led
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
the
hearts
which
surround
us
and
see
but
the
allegorical
symbols
of
human
affections
in
the
antique
train
of
the
beautiful
canephoroe
who
carried
the
fragile
and
perfumed
flowers
to
adorn
some
hapless
victim
for
the
altar
chopin
spoke
frequently
and
almost
by
preference
of
madame
sand
without
bitterness
or
recrimination
tears
always
filled
his
eyes
when
he
named
her
but
with
a
kind
of
bitter
sweetness
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
memories
of
past
days
alas
now
he
stripped
of
their
manifold
significance
in
spite
of
the
many
subterfuges
employed
by
his
friends
to
entice
him
from
dwelling
upon
remembrances
which
always
brought
dangerous
excitement
with
them
he
loved
to
return
to
them
as
if
through
the
same
feelings
which
had
once
reanimated
his
life
he
now
wished
to
destroy
it
sedulously
stifling
its
powers
through
the
vapor
of
this
subtle
poison
his
last
pleasure
seemed
to
be
the
memory
of
the
blasting
of
his
last
hope
he
treasured
the
bitter
knowledge
that
under
this
fatal
spell
his
life
was
ebbing
fast
away
all
attempts
to
fix
his
attention
upon
other
objects
were
made
in
vain
he
refused
to
be
comforted
and
would
constantly
speak
of
the
one
engrossing
subject
even
if
he
had
ceased
to
speak
of
it
would
he
not
always
have
thought
of
it
he
seemed
to
inhale
the
poison
rapidly
and
eagerly
that
he
might
thus
shorten
the
time
in
which
he
would
be
forced
to
breathe
it
although
the
exceeding
fragility
of
his
physical
constitution
might
not
have
allowed
him
under
any
circumstances
to
have
lingered
long
on
earth
yet
at
least
he
might
have
been
spared
the
bitter
sufferings
which
clouded
his
last
hours
with
a
tender
and
ardent
soul
though
exacting
through
its
fastidiousness
and
excessive
delicacy
he
could
not
live
unless
surrounded
by
the
radiant
phantoms
he
had
himself
evoked
he
could
not
expel
the
profound
sorrow
which
his
heart
cherished
as
the
sole
remaining
fragment
of
the
happy
past
he
was
another
great
and
illustrious
victim
to
the
transitory
attachments
occurring
between
persons
of
different
character
who
experiencing
a
surprise
full
of
delight
in
their
first
sudden
meeting
mistake
it
for
a
durable
feeling
and
build
hopes
and
illusions
upon
it
which
can
never
be
realized
it
is
always
the
nature
the
most
deeply
moved
the
most
absolute
in
its
hopes
and
attachments
for
which
all
transplantation
is
impossible
which
is
destroyed
and
mined
in
the
painful
awakening
from
the
absorbing
dream
terrible
power
exercised
over
man
by
the
most
exquisite
gifts
which
he
possesses
like
the
coursers
of
the
sun
when
the
hand
of
phaeton
in
place
of
guiding
their
beneficent
career
permits
them
to
wander
at
random
disordering
the
beautiful
structure
of
the
celestial
spheres
they
bring
devastation
and
flames
in
their
train
chopin
felt
and
often
repeated
that
the
sundering
of
this
long
friendship
the
rupture
of
this
strong
tie
broke
all
the
chords
which
bound
him
to
life
during
this
attack
his
life
was
despaired
of
for
several
days
gutman
his
most
distinguished
pupil
and
during
the
last
years
of
his
life
his
most
intimate
friend
lavished
upon
him
every
proof
of
tender
attachment
his
cares
his
attentions
were
the
most
agreeable
to
him
with
the
timidity
natural
to
invalids
and
with
the
tender
delicacy
peculiar
to
himself
he
once
asked
the
princess
czartoryska
who
visited
him
every
day
often
fearing
that
on
the
morrow
he
would
no
longer
be
among
the
living
if
gutman
was
not
very
much
fatigued
if
she
thought
he
would
be
able
to
continue
his
care
of
him
adding
that
his
presence
was
dearer
to
him
than
that
of
any
other
person
his
convalescence
was
very
slow
and
painful
leaving
him
indeed
but
the
semblance
of
life
at
this
epoch
he
changed
so
much
in
appearance
that
he
could
scarcely
be
recognized
the
next
summer
brought
him
that
deceptive
decrease
of
suffering
which
it
sometimes
grants
to
those
who
are
dying
he
refused
to
quit
paris
and
thus
deprived
himself
of
the
pure
air
of
the
country
and
the
benefit
of
this
vivifying
element
the
winter
of
to
was
filled
with
a
painful
and
continual
succession
of
improvements
and
relapses
notwithstanding
this
he
resolved
in
the
spring
to
accomplish
his
old
project
of
visiting
london
when
the
revolution
of
february
broke
out
he
was
still
confined
to
bed
but
with
a
melancholy
effort
he
seemed
to
try
to
interest
himself
in
the
events
of
the
day
and
spoke
of
them
more
than
usual
gutman
continued
his
most
intimate
and
constant
visitor
he
accepted
through
preference
his
cares
until
the
close
of
his
life
feeling
better
in
the
month
of
april
he
thought
of
realizing
his
contemplated
journey
of
visiting
that
country
to
which
he
had
intended
to
go
when
youth
and
life
opened
in
bright
perspective
before
him
he
set
out
for
england
where
his
works
had
already
found
an
intelligent
public
and
were
generally
known
and
admired
footnote
the
compositions
of

were
even
at

essay
on

of

we
find
some
lines
marked

just
criticism
the
epigraph
of
this
little
pamphlet
is
ingeniously
chosen
and
the
two
lines
from
shelley
could
scarcely
be
better
applied
than
to
chopin
he
was
a
mighty
poet
and
a
psychologist
the
author
of
this
pamphlet
speaks
with
enthusiasm
of
the
originative
genius
untrammeled
by
conventionalities
unfettered
by
pedantry
of
the
outpourings
of
an
unworldly
and
tristful
soul
those
musical
floods
of
tears
and
gushes
of

joyfulness
those
exquisite
embodiments

thoughts
those
infinitesimal
delicacies
which
give

sketch
of

one
thing
is
certain
viz
to
play
with
proper
feeling
and
correct
execution
the
preludes
and
studies
of
chopin
is
to
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
finished
pianist
and
moreover
to
comprehend
them
thoroughly
to
give
a
life
and
tongue
to
their
infinite
and
most
eloquent
subtleties
of
expression
involves
the
necessity
of
being
in
no
less
a
degree
a
poet
than
a
pianist
a
thinker
than
a
musician
commonplace
is
instinctively
avoided
in
all
the
works
of
chopin
a
stale
cadence
or
a
trite
progression
a
humdrum
subject
or
a
hackneyed
sequence
a
vulgar
twist
of
the
melody
or
a
out
passage
a
meagre
harmony
or
an
unskillful
counterpoint
may
in
vain
be
looked
for
throughout
the
entire
range
of
his
compositions
the
prevailing
characteristics
of
which

as
original
as

are

unexpected
and
out
of
the
common
track
in
taking
up
one
of
the
works
of
chopin
you
are
entering
as
it
were
a
fairyland
untrodden
by
human
footsteps
a
path
hitherto
unfrequented
but
by
the
great
composer
himself
and
a
faith
a
devotion
a
desire
to
appreciate
and
a
determination
to

are
absolutely
necessary
to
do
it
any
thing
like
adequate
justice
chopin
in
his
polonaises
and
in
his
mazourkas
has
aimed
at
those
characteristics
which
distinguish
the
national
music
of
his
country
so
markedly
from
that
of
all
others
that
quaint
idiosyncrasy
that
identical
wildness
and
fantasticality
that
delicious
mingling
of
the
sad
and
cheerful
which
invariably
and
forcibly
individualize
the
music
of
those
northern
nations
whose
language
delights
in
combinations
of
consonants
he
left
france
in
that
mood
of
mind
which
the
english
call
low
spirits
the
transitory
interest
which
he
had
endeavored
to
take
in
political
changes
soon
disappeared
he
became
more
taciturn
than
ever
if
through
absence
of
mind
a
few
words
would
escape
him
they
were
only
exclamations
of
regret
his
affection
for
the
limited
number
of
persons
whom
he
continued
to
see
was
filled
with
that
emotion
which
precedes
eternal
farewells
art
alone
always
retained
its
absolute
power
over

music
absorbed
him
during
the
time
now
constantly
shortening
in
which

was
able
to
occupy
himself
with
it
as
completely
as
during
the
days
when
he
was
full

pleyel
one
of
the
friends
with
whom
his
relations
had
been
the
most
constant
the
most
frequent
and
the
most
affectionate
who
is
now
rendering
a
worthy
homage
to
his
memory
occupying
himself
with
zeal
and
activity
in
the
execution
of
a
monument
for
his
tomb
at
this
concert
his
chosen
and
faithful
audience
heard
him
for
the
last
time
he
was
received
in
london
with
an
eagerness
which
had
some
effect
in
aiding
him
to
shake
off
his
sadness
to
dissipate
his
mournful
depression
perhaps
he
dreamed
by
burying
all
his
former
habits
in
oblivion
he
could
succeed
in
dissipating
his
melancholy
he
neglected
the
prescriptions
of
his
physicians
with
all
the
precautions
which
reminded
him
of
his
wretched
health
he
played
twice
in
public
and
many
times
in
private
concerts
he
mingled
much
in
society
sat
up
late
at
night
and
exposed
himself
to
considerable
fatigue
without
permitting
himself
to
be
deterred
by
any
consideration
for
his
health
he
was
presented
to
the
queen
by
the
duchess
of
sutherland
and
the
most
distinguished
society
sought
the
pleasure
of
his
acquaintance
he
went
to
edinburgh
where
the
climate
was
particularly
injurious
to
him
he
was
much
debilitated
upon
his
return
from
scotland
his
physicians
wished
him
to
leave
england
immediately
but
he
delayed
for
some
time
his
departure
who
can
read
the
feelings
which
caused
this
delay
he
played
again
at
a
concert
given
for
the
poles
it
was
the
last
mark
of
love
sent
to
his
beloved
country
the
last
look
the
last
sigh
the
last
regret
he
was
feted
applauded
and
surrounded
by
his
own
people
he
bade
them
all
adieu
they
did
not
know
it
was
an
eternal
farewell
what
thoughts
must
have
filled
his
sad
soul
as
he
crossed
the
sea
to
return
to
paris
that
paris
so
different
now
for
him
from
that
which
he
had
found
without
seeking
in
he
was
met
upon
his
arrival
by
a
surprise
as
painful
as
unexpected
molin
whose
advice
and
intelligent
prescriptions
had
saved
his
life
in
the
winter
of
to
whom
alone
he
believed
himself
indebted
for
the
prolongation
of
his
life
was
dead
he
felt
his
loss
painfully
nay
it
brought
a
profound
discouragement
with
it
at
a
time
when
the
mind
exercises
so
much
influence
over
the
progress
of
the
disease
he
persuaded
himself
that
no
one
could
replace
the
trusted
physician
and
he
had
no
confidence
in
any
other
dissatisfied
with
them
all
without
any
hope
from
their
skill
he
changed
them
constantly
a
kind
of
superstitious
depression
seized
him
no
tie
stronger
than
life
no
more
powerful
as
death
came
now
to
struggle
against
this
bitter
apathy
from
the
winter
of
chopin
had
been
in
no
condition
to
labor
continuously
from
time
to
time
he
retouched
some
scattered
leaves
without
succeeding
in
arranging
his
thoughts
in
accordance
with
his
designs
a
respectful
care
of
his
fame
dictated
to
him
the
wish
that
these
sketches
should
be
destroyed
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
their
being
mutilated
disfigured
and
transformed
into
posthumous
works
unworthy
of
his
hand
he
left
no
finished
manuscripts
except
a
very
short
waltz
and
a
last
nocturne
as
parting
memories
in
the
later
period
of
his
life
he
thought
of
writing
a
method
for
the
piano
in
which
he
intended
to
give
his
ideas
upon
the
theory
and
technicality
of
his
art
the
results
of
his
long
and
patient
studies
his
happy
innovations
and
his
intelligent
experience
the
task
was
a
difficult
one
demanding
redoubled
application
even
from
one
who
labored
as
assiduously
as
chopin
perhaps
he
wished
to
avoid
the
emotions
of
art
affecting
those
who
reproduce
them
in
serenity
of
soul
so
differently
from
those
who
repeat
in
them
their
own
desolation
of
heart
by
taking
refuge
in
a
region
so
barren
he
sought
in
this
employment
only
an
absorbing
and
uniform
occupation
he
only
asked
from
it
what
manfred
demanded
in
vain
from
the
powers
of
magic
forgetfulness
forgetfulness
granted
neither
by
the
gayety
of
amusement
nor
the
lethargy
of
torpor
on
the
contrary
with
venomous
guile
they
always
compensate
in
the
renewed
intensity
of
woe
for
the
time
they
may
have
succeeded
in
benumbing
it
in
the
daily
labor
which
charms
the
storms
of
the
soul
der
seele

beschwort
he
sought
without
doubt
forgetfulness
which
occupation
by
rendering
the
memory
torpid
may
sometimes
procure
though
it
can
not
destroy
the
sense
of
pain
at
the
close
of
that
fine
elegy
which
he
names
the
ideal
a
poet
who
was
also
the
victim
of
an
inconsolable
melancholy
appeals
to
labor
as
a
consolation
when
a
prey
to
bitter
regret
while
expecting
an
early
death
he
invokes
occupation
as
the
last
resource
against
the
incessant
anguish
of
life

the
strength
of
chopin
was
not
sufficient
for
the
execution
of
his
intention
the
occupation
was
too
abstract
too
fatiguing
he
contemplated
the
form
of
his
project
he
spoke
of
it
at
different
times
but
its
execution
had
become
impossible
he
wrote
but
a
few
pages
of
it
which
were
destroyed
with
the
rest
at
last
the
disease
augmented
so
visibly
that
the
fears
of
his
friends
assumed
the
hue
of
despair
he
scarcely
ever
left
his
bed
and
spoke
but
rarely
his
sister
upon
receiving
this
intelligence
came
from
warsaw
to
take
her
place
at
his
pillow
which
she
left
no
more
he
witnessed
the
anguish
the
presentiments
the
redoubled
sadness
around
him
without
showing
what
impression
they
made
upon
him
he
thought
of
death
with
christian
calm
and
resignation
yet
he
did
not
cease
to
prepare
for
the
morrow
the
fancy
he
had
for
changing
his
residence
was
once
more
manifested
he
took
another
lodging
disposed
the
furnishing
of
it
anew
and
occupied
himself
in
its
most
minute
details
as
he
had
taken
no
measures
to
recall
the
orders
he
had
given
for
its
arrangement
they
were
transporting
his
furniture
to
the
apartments
he
was
destined
never
to
inhabit
upon
the
very
day
of
his
death
did
he
fear
that
death
would
not
fulfil
his
plighted
promise
did
he
dread
that
after
having
touched
him
with
his
icy
hand
he
would
still
suffer
him
to
linger
upon
earth
did
he
feel
that
life
would
be
almost
unendurable
with
its
fondest
ties
broken
its
closest
links
dissevered
there
is
a
double
influence
often
felt
by
gifted
temperaments
when
upon
the
eve
of
some
event
which
is
to
decide
their
fate
the
eager
heart
urged
on
by
a
desire
to
unravel
the
mystic
secrets
of
the
unknown
future
contradicts
the
colder
the
more
timid
intellect
which
fears
to
plunge
into
the
uncertain
abyss
of
the
coming
fate
this
want
of
harmony
between
the
simultaneous
previsions
of
the
mind
and
heart
often
causes
the
firmest
spirits
to
make
assertions
which
their
actions
seem
to
contradict
yet
actions
and
assertions
both
flow
from
the
differing
sources
of
an
equal
conviction
did
chopin
suffer
from
this
inevitable
dissimilarity
between
the
prophetic
whispers
of
the
heart
and
the
thronging
doubts
of
the
questioning
mind
from
week
to
week
and
soon
from
day
to
day
the
cold
shadow
of
death
gained
upon
him
his
end
was
rapidly
approaching
his
sufferings
became
more
and
more
intense
his
crises
grew
more
frequent
and
at
each
accelerated
occurrence
resembled
more
and
more
a
mortal
agony
he
retained
his
presence
of
mind
his
vivid
will
upon
their
intermission
until
the
last
neither
losing
the
precision
of
his
ideas
nor
the
clear
perception
of
his
intentions
the
wishes
which
he
expressed
in
his
short
moments
of
respite
evinced
the
calm
solemnity
with
which
he
contemplated
the
approach
of
death
he
desired
to
be
buried
by
the
side
of
bellini
with
whom
during
the
time
of
bellini
residence
in
paris
he
had
been
intimately
acquainted
the
grave
of
bellini
is
in
the
cemetery
of
pere
lachaise
next
to
that
of
cherubini
the
desire
of
forming
an
acquaintance
with
this
great
master
whom
he
had
been
brought
up
to
admire
was
one
of
the
motives
which
when
he
left
vienna
in
to
go
to
london
induced
him
without
foreseeing
that
his
destiny
would
fix
him
there
to
pass
through
paris
chopin
now
sleeps
between
bellini
and
cherubini
men
of
very
dissimilar
genius
and
yet
to
both
of
whom
he
was
in
an
equal
degree
allied
as
he
attached
as
much
value
to
the
respect
he
felt
for
the
science
of
the
one
as
to
the
sympathy
he
acknowledged
for
the
creations
of
the
other
like
the
author
of
norma
he
was
full
of
melodic
feeling
yet
he
was
ambitions
of
attaining
the
harmonic
depth
of
the
learned
old
master
desiring
to
unite
in
a
great
and
elevated
style
the
dreamy
vagueness
of
spontaneous
emotion
with
the
erudition
of
the
most
consummate
masters
continuing
the
reserve
of
his
manners
to
the
very
last
he
did
not
request
to
see
any
one
for
the
last
time
but
he
evinced
the
most
touching
gratitude
to
all
who
approached
him
the
first
days
of
october
left
neither
doubt
nor
hope
the
fatal
moment
drew
near
the
next
day
the
next
hour
could
no
longer
be
relied
upon
gutman
and
his
sister
were
in
constant
attendance
upon
him
never
for
a
single
moment
leaving
him
the
countess
delphine
potocka
who
was
then
absent
from
paris
returned
as
soon
as
she
was
informed
of
his
imminent
danger
none
of
those
who
approached
the
dying
artist
could
tear
themselves
from
the
spectacle
of
this
great
and
gifted
soul
in
its
hours
of
mortal
anguish
however
violent
or
frivolous
the
passions
may
be
which
agitate
our
hearts
whatever
strength
or
indifference
may
be
displayed
in
meeting
unforeseen
or
sudden
accidents
which
would
seem
necessarily
overwhelming
in
their
effects
it
is
impossible
to
escape
the
impression
made
by
the
imposing
majesty
of
a
lingering
and
beautiful
death
which
touches
softens
fascinates
and
elevates
even
the
souls
the
least
prepared
for
such
holy
and
sublime
emotions
the
lingering
and
gradual
departure
of
one
among
us
for
those
unknown
shores
the
mysterious
solemnity
of
his
secret
dreams
his
commemoration
of
past
facts
and
passing
ideas
when
still
breathing
upon
the
narrow
strait
which
separates
time
from
eternity
affect
us
more
deeply
than
any
thing
else
in
this
world
sudden
catastrophes
the
dreadful
alternations
forced
upon
the
shuddering
fragile
ship
tossed
like
a
toy
by
the
wild
breath
of
the
tempest
the
blood
of
the
with
the
gloomy
smoke
of
artillery
the
horrible
into
which
our
own
habitation
is
converted
by
a
contagious
plague
conflagrations
which
wrap
whole
cities
in
their
glittering
flames
fathomless
abysses
which
open
at
our
feet
remove
us
less
sensibly
from
all
the
fleeting
attachments
which
pass
which
can
be
broken
which
cease
than
the
prolonged
view
of
a
soul
conscious
of
its
own
position
silently
contemplating
the
multiform
aspects
of
time
and
the
mute
door
of
eternity
the
courage
the
resignation
the
elevation
the
emotion
which
reconcile
it
with
that
inevitable
dissolution
so
repugnant
to
all
our
instincts
certainly
impress
the
bystanders
more
profoundly
than
the
most
frightful
catastrophes
which
in
the
confusion
they
create
rob
the
scene
of
its
still
anguish
its
solemn
meditation
the
parlor
adjoining
the
chamber
of
chopin
was
constantly
occupied
by
some
of
his
friends
who
one
by
one
in
turn
approached
him
to
receive
a
sign
of
recognition
a
look
of
affection
when
he
was
no
longer
able
to
address
them
in
words
on
sunday
the
of
october
his
attacks
were
more
violent
and
more
frequent
lasting
for
several
hours
in
succession
he
endured
them
with
patience
and
great
strength
of
mind
the
countess
delphine
potocka
who
was
present
was
much
distressed
her
tears
were
flowing
fast
when
he
observed
her
standing
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
tall
slight
draped
in
white
resembling
the
beautiful
angels
created
by
the
imagination
of
the
most
devout
among
the
painters
without
doubt
he
supposed
her
to
be
a
celestial
apparition
and
when
the
crisis
left
him
a
moment
in
repose
he
requested
her
to
sing
they
deemed
him
at
first
seized
with
delirium
but
he
eagerly
repeated
his
request
who
could
have
ventured
to
oppose
his
wish
the
piano
was
rolled
from
his
parlor
to
the
door
of
his
chamber
while
with
sobs
in
her
voice
and
tears
streaming
down
her
cheeks
his
gifted
countrywoman
sang
certainly
this
delightful
voice
had
never
before
attained
an
expression
so
full
of
profound
pathos
he
seemed
to
suffer
less
as
he
listened
she
sang
that
famous
canticle
to
the
virgin
which
it
is
said
once
saved
the
life
of
stradella
how
beautiful
it
is
he
exclaimed
my
god
how
very
beautiful
again
again
though
overwhelmed
with
emotion
the
countess
had
the
noble
courage
to
comply
with
the
last
wish
of
a
friend
a
compatriot
she
again
took
a
seat
at
the
piano
and
sung
a
hymn
from
marcello
chopin
again
feeling
worse
everybody
was
seized
with
fright
by
a
spontaneous
impulse
all
who
were
present
threw
themselves
upon
their
knees
no
one
ventured
to
speak
the
sacred
silence
was
only
broken
by
the
voice
of
the
countess
floating
like
a
melody
from
heaven
above
the
sighs
and
sobs
which
formed
its
heavy
and
mournful
it
was
the
haunted
hour
of
twilight
a
dying
light
lent
its
mysterious
shadows
to
this
sad
scene
the
sister
of
chopin
prostrated
near
his
bed
wept
and
prayed
and
never
quitted
this
attitude
of
supplication
while
the
life
of
the
brother
she
had
so
cherished
lasted
his
condition
altered
for
the
worse
during
the
night
but
he
felt
more
tranquil
upon
monday
morning
and
as
if
he
had
known
in
advance
the
appointed
and
propitious
moment
he
asked
to
receive
immediately
the
last
sacraments
in
the
absence
of
the
abbe
with
whom
he
had
been
very
intimate
since
their
common
expatriation
he
requested
that
the
abbe
jelowicki
one
of
the
most
distinguished
men
of
the
polish
emigration
should
be
sent
for
when
the
holy
viaticum
was
administered
to
him
he
received
it
surrounded
by
those
who
loved
him
with
great
devotion
he
called
his
friends
a
short
time
afterwards
one
by
one
to
his
bedside
to
give
each
of
them
his
last
earnest
blessing
calling
down
the
grace
of
god
fervently
upon
themselves
their
affections
and
their
hopes
every
knee
bent
every
head
bowed
all
eyes
were
heavy
with
tears
every
heart
was
sad
and
oppressed
every
soul
elevated
attacks
more
and
more
painful
returned
and
continued
during
the
day
from
monday
night
until
tuesday
he
did
not
utter
a
single
word
he
did
not
seem
able
to
distinguish
the
persons
who
were
around
him
about
eleven
on
tuesday
evening
he
appeared
to
revive
a
little
the
abbe
jelowicki
had
never
left
him
hardly
had
he
recovered
the
power
of
speech
than
he
requested
him
to
recite
with
him
the
prayers
and
litanies
for
the
dying
he
was
able
to
accompany
the
abbe
in
an
audible
and
intelligible
voice
from
this
moment
until
his
death
he
held
his
head
constantly
supported
upon
the
shoulder
of
gutman
who
during
the
whole
course
of
this
sickness
had
devoted
his
days
and
nights
to
him
a
convulsive
sleep
lasted
until
the
of
october
the
final
agony
commenced
about
two
a
cold
sweat
ran
profusely
from
his
brow
after
a
short
drowsiness
he
asked
in
a
voice
scarcely
audible
who
is
near
me
being
answered
he
bent
his
head
to
kiss
the
hand
of
gutman
who
still
supported
it
while
giving
this
last
tender
proof
of
love
and
gratitude
the
soul
of
the
artist
left
its
fragile
clay
he
died
as
he
had
lived
in
loving
when
the
doors
of
the
parlor
were
opened
his
friends
threw
themselves
around
the
loved
corpse
not
able
to
suppress
the
gush
of
tears
his
love
for
flowers
being
well
known
they
were
brought
in
such
quantities
the
next
day
that
the
bed
in
which
they
had
placed
them
and
indeed
the
whole
room
almost
disappeared
hidden
by
their
varied
and
brilliant
hues
he
seemed
to
repose
in
a
garden
of
roses
his
face
regained
its
early
beauty
its
purity
of
expression
its
long
unwonted
serenity
calmly
with
his
youthful
loveliness
so
long
dimmed
by
bitter
suffering
restored
by
death
he
slept
among
the
flowers
he
loved
the
last
long
and
dreamless
sleep
clesinger
reproduced
the
delicate
traits
to
which
death
had
rendered
their
early
beauty
in
a
sketch
which
he
immediately
modeled
and
which
he
afterwards
executed
in
marble
for
his
tomb
the
respectful
admiration
which
chopin
felt
for
the
genius
of
mozart
had
induced
him
to
request
that
his
requiem
should
be
performed
at
his
obsequies
this
wish
was
complied
with
the
funeral
ceremonies
took
place
in
the
madeleine
church
the
of
october
they
had
been
delayed
until
this
date
in
order
that
the
execution
of
this
great
work
should
be
worthy
of
the
master
and
his
disciple
the
principal
artists
in
paris
were
anxious
to
take
part
in
it
the
funeral
march
of
chopin
arranged
for
the
instruments
for
this
occasion
by
reber
was
introduced
at
the
introit
at
the
offertory
lefebure
vely
executed
his
admirable
preludes
in
si
and
mi
minor
upon
the
organ
the
solos
of
the
requiem
were
claimed
by
madame
viardot
and
madame
castellan
lablache
who
had
sung
the
tuba
mirum
of
this
requiem
at
the
burial
of
beethoven
in
again
sung
it
upon
this
occasion
meyerbeer
with
prince
adam
czartoryski
led
the
train
of
mourners
the
pall
was
borne
by
delacroix
franchomme
gutman
and
prince
alexander
however
insufficient
these
pages
may
be
to
speak
of
chopin
as
we
would
have
desired
we
hope
that
the
attraction
which
so
justly
surrounds
his
name
will
compensate
for
much
that
may
be
wanting
in
them
if
to
these
lines
consecrated
to
the
commemoration
of
his
works
and
to
all
that
he
held
dear
which
the
sincere
esteem
enthusiastic
regard
and
intense
sorrow
for
his
loss
can
alone
gift
with
persuasive
and
sympathetic
power
it
were
necessary
to
add
some
of
the
thoughts
awakened
in
every
man
when
death
robs
him
of
the
loved
contemporaries
of
his
youth
thus
breaking
the
first
ties
linked
by
the
confiding
and
deluded
heart
with
so
much
the
greater
pain
if
they
were
strong
enough
to
survive
that
bright
period
of
young
life
we
would
say
that
in
the
same
year
we
have
lost
the
two
dearest
friends
we
have
known
on
earth
one
of
them
perished
in
the
wild
course
of
civil
war
unfortunate
and
valiant
hero
he
fell
with
his
burning
courage
unsubdued
his
intrepid
calmness
undisturbed
his
chivalric
temerity
unabated
through
the
endurance
of
the
horrible
tortures
of
a
fearful
death
he
was
a
prince
of
rare
intelligence
of
great
activity
of
eminent
faculties
through
whose
veins
the
young
blood
circulated
with
the
glittering
ardor
of
a
subtle
gas
by
his
own
indefatigable
energy
he
had
just
succeeded
in
removing
the
difficulties
which
obstructed
his
path
in
creating
an
arena
in
which
his
faculties
might
hare
displayed
themselves
with
as
much
success
in
debates
and
the
management
of
civil
affairs
as
they
had
already
done
in
brilliant
feats
in
arms
the
other
chopin
died
slowly
consuming
himself
in
the
flames
of
his
own
genius
his
life
unconnected
with
public
events
was
like
some
fact
which
has
never
been
incorporated
in
a
material
body
the
traces
of
his
existence
are
only
to
be
found
in
the
works
which
he
has
left
he
ended
his
days
upon
a
foreign
soil
which
he
never
considered
as
his
country
remaining
faithful
in
the
devotion
of
his
affections
to
the
eternal
widowhood
of
his
own
he
was
a
poet
of
a
mournful
soul
full
of
reserve
and
complicated
mystery
and
familiar
with
the
stern
face
of
sorrow
the
immediate
interest
which
we
felt
in
the
movements
of
the
parties
to
which
the
life
of
prince
felix
lichnowsky
was
bound
was
broken
by
his
death
the
death
of
chopin
has
robbed
us
of
all
the
consolations
of
an
intelligent
and
comprehensive
friendship
the
affectionate
sympathy
with
our
feelings
with
our
manner
of
understanding
art
of
which
this
exclusive
artist
has
given
us
so
many
proofs
would
have
softened
the
disappointment
and
weariness
which
yet
await
us
and
have
strengthened
is
in
our
earliest
tendencies
confirmed
us
in
our
first
essays
since
it
has
fallen
to
our
lot
to
survive
them
we
wish
at
least
to
express
the
sincere
regret
we
feel
for
their
loss
we
deem
ourselves
bound
to
offer
the
homage
of
our
deep
and
respectful
sorrow
upon
the
grave
of
the
remarkable
musician
who
has
just
passed
from
among
us
music
is
at
present
receiving
such
great
and
general
development
that
it
reminds
us
of
that
which
took
place
in
painting
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
even
the
artists
who
limited
the
productions
of
their
genius
to
the
margins
of
parchments
painted
their
miniatures
with
an
inspiration
so
happy
that
having
broken
through
the
byzantine
stiffness
they
left
the
most
exquisite
types
which
the
francias
the
peruginos
and
the
raphaels
to
come
were
to
transport
to
their
frescos
and
introduce
upon
their
canvas
there
have
been
people
among
whom
in
order
to
preserve
the
memory
of
their
great
men
or
the
signal
events
of
their
history
it
was
the
custom
to
form
pyramids
composed
of
the
stones
which
each
was
expected
to
bring
to
the
pile
which
gradually
increased
to
an
height
from
the
anonymous
contributions
of
all
monuments
are
still
in
our
days
erected
by
an
analogous
proceeding
but
in
place
of
building
only
a
rude
and
unformed
hillock
in
consequence
of
a
fortunate
combination
the
contribution
of
all
concurs
in
the
creation
of
some
work
of
art
which
is
not
only
destined
to
perpetuate
the
mute
remembrance
which
they
wish
to
honor
but
which
may
have
the
power
to
awaken
in
future
ages
the
feelings
which
gave
birth
to
such
creation
the
emotions
of
the
contemporaries
which
called
it
into
being
the
subscriptions
which
are
opened
to
raise
statues
and
noble
memorials
to
those
who
have
rendered
their
epoch
or
country
illustrious
originate
in
this
design
immediately
after
the
death
of
chopin
camille
pleyel
conceived
a
project
of
this
kind
he
commenced
a
subscription
which
conformably
to
the
general
expectation
rapidly
amounted
to
a
considerable
sum
to
have
the
monument
modeled
by
clesinger
executed
in
marble
and
placed
in
the
pere
in
thinking
over
our
long
friendship
with
chopin
on
the
exceptional
admiration
which
we
have
always
felt
for
him
ever
since
his
appearance
in
the
musical
world
remembering
that
artist
like
himself
we
have
been
the
frequent
interpreter
of
his
inspirations
an
interpreter
we
may
safely
venture
to
say
loved
and
chosen
by
himself
that
we
have
more
frequently
than
others
received
from
his
own
lips
the
spirit
of
his
style
that
we
were
in
some
degree
identified
with
his
creations
in
art
and
with
the
feelings
which
he
confided
to
it
through
that
long
and
constant
assimilation
which
obtains
between
a
writer
and
his
translator
we
have
fondly
thought
that
these
connective
circumstances
imposed
upon
us
a
higher
and
nearer
duty
than
that
of
merely
adding
an
unformed
and
anonymous
stone
to
the
growing
pyramid
of
homage
which
his
contemporaries
are
elevating
to
him
we
believed
that
the
claims
of
a
tender
friendship
for
our
illustrious
colleague
exacted
from
us
a
more
particular
expression
of
our
profound
regret
of
our
high
admiration
it
appeared
to
us
that
we
would
not
be
true
to
ourselves
did
we
not
court
the
honor
of
inscribing
our
name
our
deep
affliction
upon
his
sepulchral
stone
this
should
be
granted
to
those
who
never
hope
to
fill
the
void
in
their
hearts
left
by
an
irreparable
loss
