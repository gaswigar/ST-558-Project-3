to

de
montheau
at
the
sign
of
the
cat
and
racket
down
the
rue
almost
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
du
there
stood
formerly
one
of
those
delightful
houses
which
enable
historians
to
reconstruct
old
paris
by
analogy
the
threatening
walls
of
this
tumbledown
abode
seemed
to
have
been
decorated
with
hieroglyphics
for
what
other
name
could
the
give
to
the
xs
and
vs
which
the
horizontal
or
diagonal
timbers
traced
on
the
front
outlined
by
little
parallel
cracks
in
the
plaster
it
was
evident
that
every
beam
quivered
in
its
mortices
at
the
passing
of
the
lightest
vehicle
this
venerable
structure
was
crowned
by
a
triangular
roof
of
which
no
example
will
ere
long
be
seen
in
paris
this
covering
warped
by
the
extremes
of
the
paris
climate
projected
three
feet
over
the
roadway
as
much
to
protect
the
threshold
from
the
rainfall
as
to
shelter
the
wall
of
a
loft
and
its
this
upper
story
was
built
of
planks
overlapping
each
other
like
slates
in
order
no
doubt
not
to
overweight
the
frail
house
one
rainy
morning
in
the
month
of
march
a
young
man
carefully
wrapped
in
his
cloak
stood
under
the
awning
of
a
shop
opposite
this
old
house
which
he
was
studying
with
the
enthusiasm
of
an
antiquary
in
point
of
fact
this
relic
of
the
civic
life
of
the
sixteenth
century
offered
more
than
one
problem
to
the
consideration
of
an
observer
each
story
presented
some
singularity
on
the
first
floor
four
tall
narrow
windows
close
together
were
filled
as
to
the
lower
panes
with
boards
so
as
to
produce
the
doubtful
light
by
which
a
clever
salesman
can
ascribe
to
his
goods
the
color
his
customers
inquire
for
the
young
man
seemed
very
scornful
of
this
part
of
the
house
his
eyes
had
not
yet
rested
on
it
the
windows
of
the
second
floor
where
the
venetian
blinds
were
drawn
up
revealing
little
dingy
muslin
curtains
behind
the
large
bohemian
glass
panes
did
not
interest
him
either
his
attention
was
attracted
to
the
third
floor
to
the
modest
of
wood
so
clumsily
wrought
that
they
might
have
found
a
place
in
the
museum
of
arts
and
crafts
to
illustrate
the
early
efforts
of
french
carpentry
these
windows
were
glazed
with
small
squares
of
glass
so
green
that
but
for
his
good
eyes
the
young
man
could
not
have
seen
the
cotton
curtains
which
screened
the
mysteries
of
the
room
from
profane
eyes
now
and
then
the
watcher
weary
of
his
fruitless
contemplation
or
of
the
silence
in
which
the
house
was
buried
like
the
whole
neighborhood
dropped
his
eyes
towards
the
lower
regions
an
involuntary
smile
parted
his
lips
each
time
he
looked
at
the
shop
where
in
fact
there
were
some
laughable
details
a
formidable
wooden
beam
resting
on
four
pillars
which
appeared
to
have
bent
under
the
weight
of
the
decrepit
house
had
been
encrusted
with
as
many
coats
of
different
paint
as
there
are
of
rouge
on
an
old
duchess
cheek
in
the
middle
of
this
broad
and
fantastically
carved
joist
there
was
an
old
painting
representing
a
cat
playing
rackets
this
picture
was
what
moved
the
young
man
to
mirth
but
it
must
be
said
that
the
wittiest
of
modern
painters
could
not
invent
so
comical
a
caricature
the
animal
held
in
one
of
its
forepaws
a
racket
as
big
as
itself
and
stood
on
its
hind
legs
to
aim
at
hitting
an
enormous
ball
returned
by
a
man
in
a
fine
embroidered
coat
drawing
color
and
accessories
all
were
treated
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
that
the
artist
had
meant
to
make
game
of
the
and
of
the
passing
observer
time
while
impairing
this
artless
painting
had
made
it
yet
more
grotesque
by
introducing
some
uncertain
features
which
must
have
puzzled
the
conscientious
idler
for
instance
the
cat
s
tail
had
been
eaten
into
in
such
a
way
that
it
might
now
have
been
taken
for
the
figure
of
a
spectator
so
long
and
thick
and
furry
were
the
tails
of
our
forefathers
cats
to
the
right
of
the
picture
on
an
azure
field
which
the
decay
of
the
wood
might
be
read
the
name
guillaume
and
to
the
left
successor
to
master
sun
and
rain
had
worn
away
most
of
the
gilding
parsimoniously
applied
to
the
letters
of
this
superscription
in
which
the
us
and
vs
had
changed
places
in
obedience
to
the
laws
of
orthography
to
quench
the
pride
of
those
who
believe
that
the
world
is
growing
cleverer
day
by
day
and
that
modern
humbug
surpasses
everything
it
may
be
observed
that
these
signs
of
which
the
origin
seems
so
whimsical
to
many
paris
merchants
are
the
dead
pictures
of
once
living
pictures
by
which
our
roguish
ancestors
contrived
to
tempt
customers
into
their
houses
thus
the
spinning
sow
the
green
monkey
and
others
were
animals
in
cages
whose
skills
astonished
the
and
whose
accomplishments
prove
the
patience
of
the
artisan
such
curiosities
did
more
to
enrich
their
fortunate
owners
than
the
signs
of
providence
grace
of
god
and
decapitation
of
john
the
baptist
which
may
still
be
seen
in
the
rue
however
our
stranger
was
certainly
not
standing
there
to
admire
the
cat
which
a
minute
s
attention
sufficed
to
stamp
on
his
memory
the
young
man
himself
had
his
peculiarities
his
cloak
folded
after
the
manner
of
an
antique
drapery
showed
a
smart
pair
of
shoes
all
the
more
remarkable
in
the
midst
of
the
paris
mud
because
he
wore
white
silk
stockings
on
which
the
splashes
betrayed
his
impatience
he
had
just
come
no
doubt
from
a
wedding
or
a
ball
for
at
this
early
hour
he
had
in
his
hand
a
pair
of
white
gloves
and
his
black
hair
now
out
of
curl
and
flowing
over
his
shoulders
showed
that
it
had
been
dressed
la
a
fashion
introduced
as
much
by
david
s
school
of
painting
as
by
the
mania
for
greek
and
roman
styles
which
characterized
the
early
years
of
this
century
in
spite
of
the
noise
made
by
a
few
market
gardeners
who
being
late
rattled
past
towards
the
great
at
a
gallop
the
busy
street
lay
in
a
stillness
of
which
the
magic
charm
is
known
only
to
those
who
have
wandered
through
deserted
paris
at
the
hours
when
its
roar
hushed
for
a
moment
rises
and
spreads
in
the
distance
like
the
great
voice
of
the
sea
this
strange
young
man
must
have
seemed
as
curious
to
the
shopkeeping
folk
of
the
cat
and
racket
as
the
cat
and
racket
was
to
him
a
dazzlingly
white
cravat
made
his
anxious
face
look
even
paler
than
it
really
was
the
fire
that
flashed
in
his
black
eyes
gloomy
and
sparkling
by
turns
was
in
harmony
with
the
singular
outline
of
his
features
with
his
wide
flexible
mouth
hardened
into
a
smile
his
forehead
knit
with
violent
annoyance
had
a
stamp
of
doom
is
not
the
forehead
the
most
prophetic
feature
of
a
man
when
the
stranger
s
brow
expressed
passion
the
furrows
formed
in
it
were
terrible
in
their
strength
and
energy
but
when
he
recovered
his
calmness
so
easily
upset
it
beamed
with
a
luminous
grace
which
gave
great
attractiveness
to
a
countenance
in
which
joy
grief
love
anger
or
scorn
blazed
out
so
contagiously
that
the
coldest
man
could
not
fail
to
be
impressed
he
was
so
thoroughly
vexed
by
the
time
when
the
of
the
loft
was
suddenly
flung
open
that
he
did
not
observe
the
apparition
of
three
laughing
faces
pink
and
white
and
chubby
but
as
vulgar
as
the
face
of
commerce
as
it
is
seen
in
sculpture
on
certain
monuments
these
three
faces
framed
by
the
window
recalled
the
puffy
cherubs
floating
among
the
clouds
that
surround
god
the
father
the
apprentices
snuffed
up
the
exhalations
of
the
street
with
an
eagerness
that
showed
how
hot
and
poisonous
the
atmosphere
of
their
garret
must
be
after
pointing
to
the
singular
sentinel
the
most
jovial
as
he
seemed
of
the
apprentices
retired
and
came
back
holding
an
instrument
whose
hard
metal
pipe
is
now
superseded
by
a
leather
tube
and
they
all
grinned
with
mischief
as
they
looked
down
on
the
loiterer
and
sprinkled
him
with
a
fine
white
shower
of
which
the
scent
proved
that
three
chins
had
just
been
shaved
standing
on
tiptoe
in
the
farthest
corner
of
their
loft
to
enjoy
their
victim
s
rage
the
lads
ceased
laughing
on
seeing
the
haughty
indifference
with
which
the
young
man
shook
his
cloak
and
the
intense
contempt
expressed
by
his
face
as
he
glanced
up
at
the
empty
at
this
moment
a
slender
white
hand
threw
up
the
lower
half
of
one
of
the
clumsy
windows
on
the
third
floor
by
the
aid
of
the
sash
runners
of
which
the
pulley
so
often
suddenly
gives
way
and
releases
the
heavy
panes
it
ought
to
hold
up
the
watcher
was
then
rewarded
for
his
long
waiting
the
face
of
a
young
girl
appeared
as
fresh
as
one
of
the
white
cups
that
bloom
on
the
bosom
of
the
waters
crowned
by
a
frill
of
tumbled
muslin
which
gave
her
head
a
look
of
exquisite
innocence
though
wrapped
in
brown
stuff
her
neck
and
shoulders
gleamed
here
and
there
through
little
openings
left
by
her
movements
in
sleep
no
expression
of
embarrassment
detracted
from
the
candor
of
her
face
or
the
calm
look
of
eyes
immortalized
long
since
in
the
sublime
works
of
raphael
here
were
the
same
grace
the
same
repose
as
in
those
virgins
and
now
proverbial
there
was
a
delightful
contrast
between
the
cheeks
of
that
face
on
which
sleep
had
as
it
were
given
high
relief
to
a
superabundance
of
life
and
the
antiquity
of
the
heavy
window
with
its
clumsy
shape
and
black
sill
like
those
flowers
which
in
the
early
morning
have
not
yet
unfurled
their
cups
twisted
by
the
chills
of
night
the
girl
as
yet
hardly
awake
let
her
blue
eyes
wander
beyond
the
neighboring
roofs
to
look
at
the
sky
then
from
habit
she
cast
them
down
on
the
gloomy
depths
of
the
street
where
they
immediately
met
those
of
her
adorer
vanity
no
doubt
distressed
her
at
being
seen
in
undress
she
started
back
the
worn
pulley
gave
way
and
the
sash
fell
with
the
rapid
run
which
in
our
day
has
earned
for
this
artless
invention
of
our
forefathers
an
odious
name
a
la
the
vision
had
disappeared
to
the
young
man
the
most
radiant
star
of
morning
seemed
to
be
hidden
by
a
cloud
during
these
little
incidents
the
heavy
inside
shutters
that
protected
the
slight
windows
of
the
shop
of
the
cat
and
racket
had
been
removed
as
if
by
magic
the
old
door
with
its
knocker
was
opened
back
against
the
wall
of
the
entry
by
a
apparently
coeval
with
the
sign
who
with
a
shaking
hand
hung
upon
it
a
square
of
cloth
on
which
were
embroidered
in
yellow
silk
the
words
guillaume
successor
to
many
a
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
guess
the
class
of
trade
carried
on
by
monsieur
guillaume
between
the
strong
iron
bars
which
protected
his
shop
windows
on
the
outside
certain
packages
wrapped
in
brown
linen
were
hardly
visible
though
as
numerous
as
herrings
swimming
in
a
shoal
notwithstanding
the
primitive
aspect
of
the
gothic
front
monsieur
guillaume
of
all
the
merchant
clothiers
in
paris
was
the
one
whose
stores
were
always
the
best
provided
whose
connections
were
the
most
extensive
and
whose
commercial
honesty
never
lay
under
the
slightest
suspicion
if
some
of
his
brethren
in
business
made
a
contract
with
the
government
and
had
not
the
required
quantity
of
cloth
he
was
always
ready
to
deliver
it
however
large
the
number
of
pieces
tendered
for
the
wily
dealer
knew
a
thousand
ways
of
extracting
the
largest
profits
without
being
obliged
like
them
to
court
patrons
cringing
to
them
or
making
them
costly
presents
when
his
could
only
pay
in
good
bills
of
long
date
he
would
mention
his
notary
as
an
accommodating
man
and
managed
to
get
a
second
profit
out
of
the
bargain
thanks
to
this
arrangement
which
had
made
it
a
proverb
among
the
traders
of
the
rue
heaven
preserve
you
from
monsieur
guillaume
s
notary
to
signify
a
heavy
discount
the
old
merchant
was
to
be
seen
standing
on
the
threshold
of
his
shop
as
if
by
a
miracle
the
instant
the
servant
withdrew
monsieur
guillaume
looked
at
the
rue
at
the
neighboring
shops
and
at
the
weather
like
a
man
disembarking
at
havre
and
seeing
france
once
more
after
a
long
voyage
having
convinced
himself
that
nothing
had
changed
while
he
was
asleep
he
presently
perceived
the
stranger
on
guard
and
he
on
his
part
gazed
at
the
patriarchal
draper
as
humboldt
may
have
scrutinized
the
first
electric
eel
he
saw
in
america
monsieur
guillaume
wore
loose
black
velvet
breeches
stockings
and
square
toed
shoes
with
silver
buckles
his
coat
with
fronts
tails
and
collar
clothed
his
slightly
bent
figure
in
greenish
cloth
finished
with
white
metal
buttons
tawny
from
wear
his
gray
hair
was
so
accurately
combed
and
flattened
over
his
yellow
pate
that
it
made
it
look
like
a
furrowed
field
his
little
green
eyes
that
might
have
been
pierced
with
a
gimlet
flashed
beneath
arches
faintly
tinged
with
red
in
the
place
of
eyebrows
anxieties
had
wrinkled
his
forehead
with
as
many
horizontal
lines
as
there
were
creases
in
his
coat
this
colorless
face
expressed
patience
commercial
shrewdness
and
the
sort
of
wily
cupidity
which
is
needful
in
business
at
that
time
these
old
families
were
less
rare
than
they
are
now
in
which
the
characteristic
habits
and
costume
of
their
calling
surviving
in
the
midst
of
more
recent
civilization
were
preserved
as
cherished
traditions
like
the
antediluvian
remains
found
by
cuvier
in
the
quarries
the
head
of
the
guillaume
family
was
a
notable
upholder
of
ancient
practices
he
might
be
heard
to
regret
the
provost
of
merchants
and
never
did
he
mention
a
decision
of
the
tribunal
of
commerce
without
calling
it
the
of
the
up
and
dressed
the
first
of
the
household
in
obedience
no
doubt
to
these
old
customs
he
stood
sternly
awaiting
the
appearance
of
his
three
assistants
ready
to
scold
them
in
case
they
were
late
these
young
disciples
of
mercury
knew
nothing
more
terrible
than
the
wordless
assiduity
with
which
the
master
scrutinized
their
faces
and
their
movements
on
monday
in
search
of
evidence
or
traces
of
their
pranks
but
at
this
moment
the
old
clothier
paid
no
heed
to
his
apprentices
he
was
absorbed
in
trying
to
divine
the
motive
of
the
anxious
looks
which
the
young
man
in
silk
stockings
and
a
cloak
cast
alternately
at
his
signboard
and
into
the
depths
of
his
shop
the
daylight
was
now
brighter
and
enabled
the
stranger
to
discern
the
cashier
s
corner
enclosed
by
a
railing
and
screened
by
old
green
silk
curtains
where
were
kept
the
immense
ledgers
the
silent
oracles
of
the
house
the
too
inquisitive
gazer
seemed
to
covet
this
little
nook
and
to
be
taking
the
plan
of
a
at
one
side
lighted
by
a
skylight
whence
the
family
at
meals
could
easily
see
the
smallest
incident
that
might
occur
at
the
so
much
affection
for
his
dwelling
seemed
suspicious
to
a
trader
who
had
lived
long
enough
to
remember
the
law
of
maximum
prices
monsieur
guillaume
naturally
thought
that
this
sinister
personage
had
an
eye
to
the
till
of
the
cat
and
racket
after
quietly
observing
the
mute
duel
which
was
going
on
between
his
master
and
the
stranger
the
eldest
of
the
apprentices
having
seen
that
the
young
man
was
stealthily
watching
the
windows
of
the
third
floor
ventured
to
place
himself
on
the
stone
flag
where
monsieur
guillaume
was
standing
he
took
two
steps
out
into
the
street
raised
his
head
and
fancied
that
he
caught
sight
of
mademoiselle
augustine
guillaume
in
hasty
retreat
the
draper
annoyed
by
his
assistant
s
perspicacity
shot
a
side
glance
at
him
but
the
draper
and
his
amorous
apprentice
were
suddenly
relieved
from
the
fears
which
the
young
man
s
presence
had
excited
in
their
minds
he
hailed
a
hackney
cab
on
its
way
to
a
neighboring
stand
and
jumped
into
it
with
an
air
of
affected
indifference
this
departure
was
a
balm
to
the
hearts
of
the
other
two
lads
who
had
been
somewhat
uneasy
as
to
meeting
the
victim
of
their
practical
joke
well
gentlemen
what
ails
you
that
you
are
standing
there
with
your
arms
folded
said
monsieur
guillaume
to
his
three
neophytes
in
former
days
bless
you
when
i
was
in
master
chevrel
s
service
i
should
have
overhauled
more
than
two
pieces
of
cloth
by
this
then
it
was
daylight
earlier
said
the
second
assistant
whose
duty
this
was
the
old
shopkeeper
could
not
help
smiling
though
two
of
these
young
fellows
who
were
confided
to
his
care
by
their
fathers
rich
manufacturers
at
louviers
and
at
sedan
had
only
to
ask
and
to
have
a
hundred
thousand
francs
the
day
when
they
were
old
enough
to
settle
in
life
guillaume
regarded
it
as
his
duty
to
keep
them
under
the
rod
of
an
despotism
unknown
nowadays
in
the
showy
modern
shops
where
the
apprentices
expect
to
be
rich
men
at
thirty
he
made
them
work
like
negroes
these
three
assistants
were
equal
to
a
business
which
would
harry
ten
such
clerks
as
those
whose
sybaritical
tastes
now
swell
the
columns
of
the
budget
not
a
sound
disturbed
the
peace
of
this
solemn
house
where
the
hinges
were
always
oiled
and
where
the
meanest
article
of
furniture
showed
the
respectable
cleanliness
which
reveals
strict
order
and
economy
the
most
waggish
of
the
three
youths
often
amused
himself
by
writing
the
date
of
its
first
appearance
on
the
gruyere
cheese
which
was
left
to
their
tender
mercies
at
breakfast
and
which
it
was
their
pleasure
to
leave
untouched
this
bit
of
mischief
and
a
few
others
of
the
same
stamp
would
sometimes
bring
a
smile
on
the
face
of
the
younger
of
guillaume
s
daughters
the
pretty
maiden
who
has
just
now
appeared
to
the
bewitched
man
in
the
street
though
each
of
these
apprentices
even
the
eldest
paid
a
round
sum
for
his
board
not
one
of
them
would
have
been
bold
enough
to
remain
at
the
master
s
table
when
dessert
was
served
when
madame
guillaume
talked
of
dressing
the
salad
the
hapless
youths
trembled
as
they
thought
of
the
thrift
with
which
her
prudent
hand
dispensed
the
oil
they
could
never
think
of
spending
a
night
away
from
the
house
without
having
given
long
before
a
plausible
reason
for
such
an
irregularity
every
sunday
each
in
his
turn
two
of
them
accompanied
the
guillaume
family
to
mass
at
and
to
vespers
mesdemoiselles
virginie
and
augustine
simply
attired
in
cotton
print
each
took
the
arm
of
an
apprentice
and
walked
in
front
under
the
piercing
eye
of
their
mother
who
closed
the
little
family
procession
with
her
husband
accustomed
by
her
to
carry
two
large
bound
in
black
morocco
the
second
apprentice
received
no
salary
as
for
the
eldest
whose
twelve
years
of
perseverance
and
discretion
had
initiated
him
into
the
secrets
of
the
house
he
was
paid
eight
hundred
francs
a
year
as
the
reward
of
his
labors
on
certain
family
festivals
he
received
as
a
gratuity
some
little
gift
to
which
madame
guillaume
s
dry
and
wrinkled
hand
alone
gave
value
netted
purses
which
she
took
care
to
stuff
with
cotton
wool
to
show
off
the
fancy
stitches
braces
of
the
strongest
make
or
heavy
silk
stockings
sometimes
but
rarely
this
prime
minister
was
admitted
to
share
the
pleasures
of
the
family
when
they
went
into
the
country
or
when
after
waiting
for
months
they
made
up
their
mind
to
exert
the
right
acquired
by
taking
a
box
at
the
theatre
to
command
a
piece
which
paris
had
already
forgotten
as
to
the
other
assistants
the
barrier
of
respect
which
formerly
divided
a
master
draper
from
his
apprentices
was
that
they
would
have
been
more
likely
to
steal
a
piece
of
cloth
than
to
infringe
this
etiquette
such
reserve
may
now
appear
ridiculous
but
these
old
houses
were
a
school
of
honesty
and
sound
morals
the
masters
adopted
their
apprentices
the
young
man
s
linen
was
cared
for
mended
and
often
replaced
by
the
mistress
of
the
house
if
an
apprentice
fell
ill
he
was
the
object
of
truly
maternal
attention
in
a
case
of
danger
the
master
lavished
his
money
in
calling
in
the
most
celebrated
physicians
for
he
was
not
answerable
to
their
parents
merely
for
the
good
conduct
and
training
of
the
lads
if
one
of
them
whose
character
was
unimpeachable
suffered
misfortune
these
old
tradesmen
knew
how
to
value
the
intelligence
he
had
displayed
and
they
did
not
hesitate
to
entrust
the
happiness
of
their
daughters
to
men
whom
they
had
long
trusted
with
their
fortunes
guillaume
was
one
of
these
men
of
the
old
school
and
if
he
had
their
ridiculous
side
he
had
all
their
good
qualities
and
joseph
lebas
the
chief
assistant
an
orphan
without
any
fortune
was
in
his
mind
destined
to
be
the
husband
of
virginie
his
elder
daughter
but
joseph
did
not
share
the
symmetrical
ideas
of
his
master
who
would
not
for
an
empire
have
given
his
second
daughter
in
marriage
before
the
elder
the
unhappy
assistant
felt
that
his
heart
was
wholly
given
to
mademoiselle
augustine
the
younger
in
order
to
justify
this
passion
which
had
grown
up
in
secret
it
is
necessary
to
inquire
a
little
further
into
the
springs
of
the
absolute
government
which
ruled
the
old
s
household
guillaume
had
two
daughters
the
elder
mademoiselle
virginie
was
the
very
image
of
her
mother
madame
guillaume
daughter
of
the
sieur
chevrel
sat
so
upright
in
the
stool
behind
her
desk
that
more
than
once
she
had
heard
some
wag
bet
that
she
was
a
stuffed
figure
her
long
thin
face
betrayed
exaggerated
piety
devoid
of
attractions
or
of
amiable
manners
madame
guillaume
commonly
decorated
her
head
that
of
a
woman
near
on
sixty
with
a
cap
of
a
particular
and
unvarying
shape
with
long
lappets
like
that
of
a
widow
in
all
the
neighborhood
she
was
known
as
the
portress
her
speech
was
curt
and
her
movements
had
the
stiff
precision
of
a
semaphore
her
eye
with
a
gleam
in
it
like
a
cat
s
seemed
to
spite
the
world
because
she
was
so
ugly
mademoiselle
virginie
brought
up
like
her
younger
sister
under
the
domestic
rule
of
her
mother
had
reached
the
age
of
youth
mitigated
the
graceless
effect
which
her
likeness
to
her
mother
sometimes
gave
to
her
features
but
maternal
austerity
had
endowed
her
with
two
great
qualities
which
made
up
for
everything
she
was
patient
and
gentle
mademoiselle
augustine
who
was
but
just
eighteen
was
not
like
either
her
father
or
her
mother
she
was
one
of
those
daughters
whose
total
absence
of
any
physical
affinity
with
their
parents
makes
one
believe
in
the
adage
god
gives
augustine
was
little
or
to
describe
her
more
truly
delicately
made
full
of
gracious
candor
a
man
of
the
world
could
have
found
no
fault
in
the
charming
girl
beyond
a
certain
meanness
of
gesture
or
vulgarity
of
attitude
and
sometimes
a
want
of
ease
her
silent
and
placid
face
was
full
of
the
transient
melancholy
which
comes
over
all
young
girls
who
are
too
weak
to
dare
to
resist
their
mother
s
will
the
two
sisters
always
plainly
dressed
could
not
gratify
the
innate
vanity
of
womanhood
but
by
a
luxury
of
cleanliness
which
became
them
wonderfully
and
made
them
harmonize
with
the
polished
counters
and
the
shining
shelves
on
which
the
old
never
left
a
speck
of
dust
and
with
the
simplicity
of
all
they
saw
about
them
as
their
style
of
living
compelled
them
to
find
the
elements
of
happiness
in
persistent
work
augustine
and
virginie
had
hitherto
always
satisfied
their
mother
who
secretly
prided
herself
on
the
perfect
characters
of
her
two
daughters
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
results
of
the
training
they
had
received
brought
up
to
a
commercial
life
accustomed
to
hear
nothing
but
dreary
arguments
and
calculations
about
trade
having
studied
nothing
but
grammar
a
little
and
the
history
of
france
in
le
ragois
and
never
reading
any
book
but
what
their
mother
would
sanction
their
ideas
had
not
acquired
much
scope
they
knew
perfectly
how
to
keep
house
they
were
familiar
with
the
prices
of
things
they
understood
the
difficulty
of
amassing
money
they
were
economical
and
had
a
great
respect
for
the
qualities
that
make
a
man
of
business
although
their
father
was
rich
they
were
as
skilled
in
darning
as
in
embroidery
their
mother
often
talked
of
having
them
taught
to
cook
so
that
they
might
know
how
to
order
a
dinner
and
scold
a
cook
with
due
knowledge
they
knew
nothing
of
the
pleasures
of
the
world
and
seeing
how
their
parents
spent
their
exemplary
lives
they
very
rarely
suffered
their
eyes
to
wander
beyond
the
walls
of
their
hereditary
home
which
to
their
mother
was
the
whole
universe
the
meetings
to
which
family
anniversaries
gave
rise
filled
in
the
future
of
earthly
joy
to
them
when
the
great
on
the
second
floor
was
to
be
prepared
to
receive
company
madame
roguin
a
demoiselle
chevrel
fifteen
months
younger
than
her
cousin
and
bedecked
with
diamonds
young
rabourdin
employed
in
the
finance
office
monsieur
cesar
birotteau
the
rich
perfumer
and
his
wife
known
as
madame
cesar
monsieur
camusot
the
richest
silk
mercer
in
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
with
his
monsieur
cardot
two
or
three
old
bankers
and
some
immaculate
ladies
the
arrangements
made
necessary
by
the
way
in
which
everything
was
packed
away
the
plate
the
dresden
china
the
candlesticks
and
the
glass
made
a
variety
in
the
monotonous
lives
of
the
three
women
who
came
and
went
and
exerted
themselves
as
nuns
would
to
receive
their
bishop
then
in
the
evening
when
all
three
were
tired
out
with
having
wiped
rubbed
unpacked
and
arranged
all
the
gauds
of
the
festival
as
the
girls
helped
their
mother
to
undress
madame
guillaume
would
say
to
them
children
we
have
done
nothing
when
on
very
great
occasions
the
portress
nun
allowed
dancing
restricting
the
games
of
boston
whist
and
backgammon
within
the
limits
of
her
bedroom
such
a
concession
was
accounted
as
the
most
unhoped
felicity
and
made
them
happier
than
going
to
the
great
balls
to
two
or
three
of
which
guillaume
would
take
the
girls
at
the
time
of
the
carnival
and
once
a
year
the
worthy
draper
gave
an
entertainment
when
he
spared
no
expense
however
rich
and
fashionable
the
persons
invited
might
be
they
were
careful
not
to
be
absent
for
the
most
important
houses
on
the
exchange
had
recourse
to
the
immense
credit
the
fortune
or
the
experience
of
monsieur
guillaume
still
the
excellent
merchant
s
daughters
did
not
benefit
as
much
as
might
be
supposed
by
the
lessons
the
world
has
to
offer
to
young
spirits
at
these
parties
which
were
indeed
set
down
in
the
ledger
to
the
credit
of
the
house
they
wore
dresses
the
shabbiness
of
which
made
them
blush
their
style
of
dancing
was
not
in
any
way
remarkable
and
their
mother
s
surveillance
did
not
allow
of
their
holding
any
conversation
with
their
partners
beyond
yes
and
no
also
the
law
of
the
old
sign
of
the
cat
and
racket
commanded
that
they
should
be
home
by
eleven
o
clock
the
hour
when
balls
and
fetes
begin
to
be
lively
thus
their
pleasures
which
seemed
to
conform
very
fairly
to
their
father
s
position
were
often
made
insipid
by
circumstances
which
were
part
of
the
family
habits
and
principles
as
to
their
usual
life
one
remark
will
sufficiently
paint
it
madame
guillaume
required
her
daughters
to
be
dressed
very
early
in
the
morning
to
come
down
every
day
at
the
same
hour
and
she
ordered
their
employments
with
monastic
regularity
augustine
however
had
been
gifted
by
chance
with
a
spirit
lofty
enough
to
feel
the
emptiness
of
such
a
life
her
blue
eyes
would
sometimes
be
raised
as
if
to
pierce
the
depths
of
that
gloomy
staircase
and
those
damp
after
sounding
the
profound
cloistral
silence
she
seemed
to
be
listening
to
remote
inarticulate
revelations
of
the
life
of
passion
which
accounts
feelings
as
of
higher
value
than
things
and
at
such
moments
her
cheek
would
flush
her
idle
hands
would
lay
the
muslin
sewing
on
the
polished
oak
counter
and
presently
her
mother
would
say
in
a
voice
of
which
even
the
softest
tones
were
sour
augustine
my
treasure
what
are
you
thinking
about
it
is
possible
that
two
romances
discovered
by
augustine
in
the
cupboard
of
a
cook
madame
guillaume
had
lately
discharged
comte
de
and
comte
de
may
have
contributed
to
develop
the
ideas
of
the
young
girl
who
had
devoured
them
in
secret
during
the
long
nights
of
the
past
winter
and
so
augustine
s
expression
of
vague
longing
her
gentle
voice
her
jasmine
skin
and
her
blue
eyes
had
lighted
in
poor
lebas
soul
a
flame
as
ardent
as
it
was
reverent
from
an
easily
understood
caprice
augustine
felt
no
affection
for
the
orphan
perhaps
she
did
not
know
that
he
loved
her
on
the
other
hand
the
senior
apprentice
with
his
long
legs
his
chestnut
hair
his
big
hands
and
powerful
frame
had
found
a
secret
admirer
in
mademoiselle
virginie
who
in
spite
of
her
dower
of
fifty
thousand
crowns
had
as
yet
no
suitor
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
these
two
passions
at
born
in
the
silence
of
the
dingy
shop
as
violets
bloom
in
the
depths
of
a
wood
the
mute
and
constant
looks
which
made
the
young
people
s
eyes
meet
by
sheer
need
of
change
in
the
midst
of
persistent
work
and
cloistered
peace
was
sure
sooner
or
later
to
give
rise
to
feelings
of
love
the
habit
of
seeing
always
the
same
face
leads
insensibly
to
our
reading
there
the
qualities
of
the
soul
and
at
last
effaces
all
its
defects
at
the
pace
at
which
that
man
goes
our
girls
will
soon
have
to
go
on
their
knees
to
a
suitor
said
monsieur
guillaume
to
himself
as
he
read
the
first
decree
by
which
napoleon
drew
in
advance
on
the
conscript
classes
from
that
day
the
old
merchant
grieved
at
seeing
his
eldest
daughter
fade
remembered
how
he
had
married
mademoiselle
chevrel
under
much
the
same
circumstances
as
those
of
joseph
lebas
and
virginie
a
good
bit
of
business
to
marry
off
his
daughter
and
discharge
a
sacred
debt
by
repaying
to
an
orphan
the
benefit
he
had
formerly
received
from
his
predecessor
under
similar
conditions
joseph
lebas
who
was
now
was
aware
of
the
obstacle
which
a
difference
of
fifteen
years
placed
between
augustine
and
himself
being
also
too
not
to
understand
monsieur
guillaume
s
purpose
he
knew
his
inexorable
principles
well
enough
to
feel
sure
that
the
second
would
never
marry
before
the
elder
so
the
hapless
assistant
whose
heart
was
as
warm
as
his
legs
were
long
and
his
chest
deep
suffered
in
silence
this
was
the
state
of
the
affairs
in
the
tiny
republic
which
in
the
heart
of
the
rue
was
not
unlike
a
dependency
of
la
trappe
but
to
give
a
full
account
of
events
as
well
as
of
feelings
it
is
needful
to
go
back
to
some
months
before
the
scene
with
which
this
story
opens
at
dusk
one
evening
a
young
man
passing
the
darkened
shop
of
the
cat
and
racket
had
paused
for
a
moment
to
gaze
at
a
picture
which
might
have
arrested
every
painter
in
the
world
the
shop
was
not
yet
lighted
and
was
as
a
dark
cave
beyond
which
the
was
visible
a
hanging
lamp
shed
the
yellow
light
which
lends
such
charm
to
pictures
of
the
dutch
school
the
white
linen
the
silver
the
cut
glass
were
brilliant
accessories
and
made
more
picturesque
by
strong
contrasts
of
light
and
shade
the
figures
of
the
head
of
the
family
and
his
wife
the
faces
of
the
apprentices
and
the
pure
form
of
augustine
near
whom
a
fat
maid
was
standing
composed
so
strange
a
group
the
heads
were
so
singular
and
every
face
had
so
candid
an
expression
it
was
so
easy
to
read
the
peace
the
silence
the
modest
way
of
life
in
this
family
that
to
an
artist
accustomed
to
render
nature
there
was
something
hopeless
in
any
attempt
to
depict
this
scene
come
upon
by
chance
the
stranger
was
a
young
painter
who
seven
years
before
had
gained
the
first
prize
for
painting
he
had
now
just
come
back
from
rome
his
soul
with
poetry
his
eyes
satiated
with
raphael
and
michael
angelo
thirsted
for
real
nature
after
long
dwelling
in
the
pompous
land
where
art
has
everywhere
left
something
grandiose
right
or
wrong
this
was
his
personal
feeling
his
heart
which
had
long
been
a
prey
to
the
fire
of
italian
passion
craved
one
of
those
modest
and
meditative
maidens
whom
in
rome
he
had
unfortunately
seen
only
in
painting
from
the
enthusiasm
produced
in
his
excited
fancy
by
the
living
picture
before
him
he
naturally
passed
to
a
profound
admiration
for
the
principal
figure
augustine
seemed
to
be
pensive
and
did
not
eat
by
the
arrangement
of
the
lamp
the
light
fell
full
on
her
face
and
her
bust
seemed
to
move
in
a
circle
of
fire
which
threw
up
the
shape
of
her
head
and
illuminated
it
with
almost
supernatural
effect
the
artist
involuntarily
compared
her
to
an
exiled
angel
dreaming
of
heaven
an
almost
unknown
emotion
a
limpid
seething
love
flooded
his
heart
after
remaining
a
minute
overwhelmed
by
the
weight
of
his
ideas
he
tore
himself
from
his
bliss
went
home
ate
nothing
and
could
not
sleep
the
next
day
he
went
to
his
studio
and
did
not
come
out
of
it
till
he
had
placed
on
canvas
the
magic
of
the
scene
of
which
the
memory
had
in
a
sense
made
him
a
devotee
his
happiness
was
incomplete
till
he
should
possess
a
faithful
portrait
of
his
idol
he
went
many
times
past
the
house
of
the
cat
and
racket
he
even
ventured
in
once
or
twice
under
a
disguise
to
get
a
closer
view
of
the
bewitching
creature
that
madame
guillaume
covered
with
her
wing
for
eight
whole
months
devoted
to
his
love
and
to
his
brush
he
was
lost
to
the
sight
of
his
most
intimate
friends
forgetting
the
world
the
theatre
poetry
music
and
all
his
dearest
habits
one
morning
girodet
broke
through
all
the
barriers
with
which
artists
are
familiar
and
which
they
know
how
to
evade
went
into
his
room
and
woke
him
by
asking
what
are
you
going
to
send
to
the
salon
the
artist
grasped
his
friend
s
hand
dragged
him
off
to
the
studio
uncovered
a
small
easel
picture
and
a
portrait
after
a
long
and
eager
study
of
the
two
masterpieces
girodet
threw
himself
on
his
comrade
s
neck
and
hugged
him
without
speaking
a
word
his
feelings
could
only
be
expressed
as
he
felt
them
soul
to
soul
you
are
in
love
said
girodet
they
both
knew
that
the
finest
portraits
by
titian
raphael
and
leonardo
da
vinci
were
the
outcome
of
the
enthusiastic
sentiments
by
which
indeed
under
various
conditions
every
masterpiece
is
engendered
the
artist
only
bent
his
head
in
reply
how
happy
are
you
to
be
able
to
be
in
love
here
after
coming
back
from
italy
but
i
do
not
advise
you
to
send
such
works
as
these
to
the
salon
the
great
painter
went
on
you
see
these
two
works
will
not
be
appreciated
such
true
coloring
such
prodigious
work
can
not
yet
be
understood
the
public
is
not
accustomed
to
such
depths
the
pictures
we
paint
my
dear
fellow
are
mere
screens
we
should
do
better
to
turn
rhymes
and
translate
the
antique
poets
there
is
more
glory
to
be
looked
for
there
than
from
our
luckless
canvases
notwithstanding
this
charitable
advice
the
two
pictures
were
exhibited
the
made
a
revolution
in
painting
it
gave
birth
to
the
pictures
of
genre
which
pour
into
all
our
exhibitions
in
such
prodigious
quantity
that
they
might
be
supposed
to
be
produced
by
machinery
as
to
the
portrait
few
artists
have
forgotten
that
lifelike
work
and
the
public
which
as
a
body
is
sometimes
discerning
awarded
it
the
crown
which
girodet
himself
had
hung
over
it
the
two
pictures
were
surrounded
by
a
vast
throng
they
fought
for
places
as
women
say
speculators
and
moneyed
men
would
have
covered
the
canvas
with
double
napoleons
but
the
artist
obstinately
refused
to
sell
or
to
make
replicas
an
enormous
sum
was
offered
him
for
the
right
of
engraving
them
and
the
were
not
more
favored
than
the
amateurs
though
these
incidents
occupied
the
world
they
were
not
of
a
nature
to
penetrate
the
recesses
of
the
monastic
solitude
in
the
rue
however
when
paying
a
visit
to
madame
guillaume
the
notary
s
wife
spoke
of
the
exhibition
before
augustine
of
whom
she
was
very
fond
and
explained
its
purpose
madame
roguin
s
gossip
naturally
inspired
augustine
with
a
wish
to
see
the
pictures
and
with
courage
enough
to
ask
her
cousin
secretly
to
take
her
to
the
louvre
her
cousin
succeeded
in
the
negotiations
she
opened
with
madame
guillaume
for
permission
to
release
the
young
girl
for
two
hours
from
her
dull
labors
augustine
was
thus
able
to
make
her
way
through
the
crowd
to
see
the
crowned
work
a
fit
of
trembling
shook
her
like
an
aspen
leaf
as
she
recognized
herself
she
was
terrified
and
looked
about
her
to
find
madame
roguin
from
whom
she
had
been
separated
by
a
tide
of
people
at
that
moment
her
frightened
eyes
fell
on
the
impassioned
face
of
the
young
painter
she
at
once
recalled
the
figure
of
a
loiterer
whom
being
curious
she
had
frequently
observed
believing
him
to
be
a
new
neighbor
you
see
how
love
has
inspired
me
said
the
artist
in
the
timid
creature
s
ear
and
she
stood
in
dismay
at
the
words
she
found
supernatural
courage
to
enable
her
to
push
through
the
crowd
and
join
her
cousin
who
was
still
struggling
with
the
mass
of
people
that
hindered
her
from
getting
to
the
picture
you
will
be
stifled
cried
augustine
let
us
but
there
are
moments
at
the
salon
when
two
women
are
not
always
free
to
direct
their
steps
through
the
galleries
by
the
irregular
course
to
which
they
were
compelled
by
the
press
mademoiselle
guillaume
and
her
cousin
were
pushed
to
within
a
few
steps
of
the
second
picture
chance
thus
brought
them
both
together
to
where
they
could
easily
see
the
canvas
made
famous
by
fashion
for
once
in
agreement
with
talent
madame
roguin
s
exclamation
of
surprise
was
lost
in
the
hubbub
and
buzz
of
the
crowd
augustine
involuntarily
shed
tears
at
the
sight
of
this
wonderful
study
then
by
an
almost
unaccountable
impulse
she
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
as
she
perceived
quite
near
her
the
ecstatic
face
of
the
young
painter
the
stranger
replied
by
a
nod
and
pointed
to
madame
roguin
as
a
to
show
augustine
that
he
had
understood
this
pantomime
struck
the
young
girl
like
hot
coals
on
her
flesh
she
felt
quite
guilty
as
she
perceived
that
there
was
a
compact
between
herself
and
the
artist
the
suffocating
heat
the
dazzling
sight
of
beautiful
dresses
the
bewilderment
produced
in
augustine
s
brain
by
the
truth
of
coloring
the
multitude
of
living
or
painted
figures
the
profusion
of
gilt
frames
gave
her
a
sense
of
intoxication
which
doubled
her
alarms
she
would
perhaps
have
fainted
if
an
unknown
rapture
had
not
surged
up
in
her
heart
to
vivify
her
whole
being
in
spite
of
this
chaos
of
sensations
she
nevertheless
believed
herself
to
be
under
the
power
of
the
devil
of
whose
awful
snares
she
had
been
warned
of
by
the
thundering
words
of
preachers
this
moment
was
to
her
like
a
moment
of
madness
she
found
herself
accompanied
to
her
cousin
s
carriage
by
the
young
man
radiant
with
joy
and
love
augustine
a
prey
to
an
agitation
new
to
her
experience
an
intoxication
which
seemed
to
abandon
her
to
nature
listened
to
the
eloquent
voice
of
her
heart
and
looked
again
and
again
at
the
young
painter
betraying
the
emotion
that
came
over
her
never
had
the
bright
rose
of
her
cheeks
shown
in
stronger
contrast
with
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
the
artist
saw
her
beauty
in
all
its
bloom
her
maiden
modesty
in
all
its
glory
she
herself
felt
a
sort
of
rapture
mingled
with
terror
at
thinking
that
her
presence
had
brought
happiness
to
him
whose
name
was
on
every
lip
and
whose
talent
lent
immortality
to
transient
scenes
she
was
loved
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
it
when
she
no
longer
saw
the
artist
these
simple
words
still
echoed
in
her
ear
you
see
how
love
has
inspired
me
and
the
throbs
of
her
heart
as
they
grew
deeper
seemed
a
pain
her
heated
blood
revealed
so
many
unknown
forces
in
her
being
she
affected
a
severe
headache
to
avoid
replying
to
her
cousin
s
questions
concerning
the
pictures
but
on
their
return
madame
roguin
could
not
forbear
from
speaking
to
madame
guillaume
of
the
fame
that
had
fallen
on
the
house
of
the
cat
and
racket
and
augustine
quaked
in
every
limb
as
she
heard
her
mother
say
that
she
should
go
to
the
salon
to
see
her
house
there
the
young
girl
again
declared
herself
suffering
and
obtained
leave
to
go
to
bed
that
is
what
comes
of
exclaimed
monsieur
guillaume
a
headache
and
is
it
so
very
amusing
to
see
in
a
picture
what
you
can
see
any
day
in
your
own
street
don
t
talk
to
me
of
your
artists
like
writers
they
are
a
starveling
crew
why
the
devil
need
they
choose
my
house
to
flout
it
in
their
pictures
it
may
help
to
sell
a
few
ells
more
of
cloth
said
joseph
lebas
this
remark
did
not
protect
art
and
thought
from
being
condemned
once
again
before
the
of
trade
as
may
be
supposed
these
speeches
did
not
infuse
much
hope
into
augustine
who
during
the
night
gave
herself
up
to
the
first
meditations
of
love
the
events
of
the
day
were
like
a
dream
which
it
was
a
joy
to
recall
to
her
mind
she
was
initiated
into
the
fears
the
hopes
the
remorse
all
the
ebb
and
flow
of
feeling
which
could
not
fail
to
toss
a
heart
so
simple
and
timid
as
hers
what
a
void
she
perceived
in
this
gloomy
house
what
a
treasure
she
found
in
her
soul
to
be
the
wife
of
a
genius
to
share
his
glory
what
ravages
must
such
a
vision
make
in
the
heart
of
a
girl
brought
up
among
such
a
family
what
hopes
must
it
raise
in
a
young
creature
who
in
the
midst
of
sordid
elements
had
pined
for
a
life
of
elegance
a
sunbeam
had
fallen
into
the
prison
augustine
was
suddenly
in
love
so
many
of
her
feelings
were
soothed
that
she
succumbed
without
reflection
at
eighteen
does
not
love
hold
a
prism
between
the
world
and
the
eyes
of
a
young
girl
she
was
incapable
of
suspecting
the
hard
facts
which
result
from
the
union
of
a
loving
woman
with
a
man
of
imagination
and
she
believed
herself
called
to
make
him
happy
not
seeing
any
disparity
between
herself
and
him
to
her
the
future
would
be
as
the
present
when
next
day
her
father
and
mother
returned
from
the
salon
their
dejected
faces
proclaimed
some
disappointment
in
the
first
place
the
painter
had
removed
the
two
pictures
and
then
madame
guillaume
had
lost
her
cashmere
shawl
but
the
news
that
the
pictures
had
disappeared
from
the
walls
since
her
visit
revealed
to
augustine
a
delicacy
of
sentiment
which
a
woman
can
always
appreciate
even
by
instinct
on
the
morning
when
on
his
way
home
from
a
ball
theodore
de
sommervieux
for
this
was
the
name
which
fame
had
stamped
on
augustine
s
heart
had
been
squirted
on
by
the
apprentices
while
awaiting
the
appearance
of
his
artless
little
friend
who
certainly
did
not
know
that
he
was
there
the
lovers
had
seen
each
other
for
the
fourth
time
only
since
their
meeting
at
the
salon
the
difficulties
which
the
rule
of
the
house
placed
in
the
way
of
the
painter
s
ardent
nature
gave
added
violence
to
his
passion
for
augustine
how
could
he
get
near
to
a
young
girl
seated
in
a
between
two
such
women
as
mademoiselle
virginie
and
madame
guillaume
how
could
he
correspond
with
her
when
her
mother
never
left
her
side
ingenious
as
lovers
are
to
imagine
woes
theodore
saw
a
rival
in
one
of
the
assistants
to
whose
interests
he
supposed
the
others
to
be
devoted
if
he
should
evade
these
sons
of
argus
he
would
yet
be
wrecked
under
the
stern
eye
of
the
old
draper
or
of
madame
guillaume
the
very
vehemence
of
his
passion
hindered
the
young
painter
from
hitting
on
the
ingenious
expedients
which
in
prisoners
and
in
lovers
seem
to
be
the
last
effort
of
intelligence
spurred
by
a
wild
craving
for
liberty
or
by
the
fire
of
love
theodore
wandered
about
the
neighborhood
with
the
restlessness
of
a
madman
as
though
movement
might
inspire
him
with
some
device
after
racking
his
imagination
it
occurred
to
him
to
bribe
the
blowsy
with
gold
thus
a
few
notes
were
exchanged
at
long
intervals
during
the
fortnight
following
the
morning
when
monsieur
guillaume
and
theodore
had
so
scrutinized
one
another
at
the
present
moment
the
young
couple
had
agreed
to
see
each
other
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
day
and
on
sunday
at
during
mass
and
vespers
augustine
had
sent
her
dear
theodore
a
list
of
the
relations
and
friends
of
the
family
to
whom
the
young
painter
tried
to
get
access
in
the
hope
of
interesting
if
it
were
possible
in
his
love
affairs
one
of
these
souls
absorbed
in
money
and
trade
to
whom
a
genuine
passion
must
appear
a
quite
monstrous
speculation
a
thing
nothing
meanwhile
was
altered
at
the
sign
of
the
cat
and
racket
if
augustine
was
if
against
all
obedience
to
the
domestic
code
she
stole
up
to
her
room
to
make
signals
by
means
of
a
jar
of
flowers
if
she
sighed
if
she
were
lost
in
thought
no
one
observed
it
not
even
her
mother
this
will
cause
some
surprise
to
those
who
have
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
household
where
an
idea
tainted
with
poetry
would
be
in
startling
contrast
to
persons
and
things
where
no
one
could
venture
on
a
gesture
or
a
look
which
would
not
be
seen
and
analyzed
nothing
however
could
be
more
natural
the
quiet
barque
that
navigated
the
stormy
waters
of
the
paris
exchange
under
the
flag
of
the
cat
and
racket
was
just
now
in
the
toils
of
one
of
these
tempests
which
returning
periodically
might
be
termed
equinoctial
for
the
last
fortnight
the
five
men
forming
the
crew
with
madame
guillaume
and
mademoiselle
virginie
had
been
devoting
themselves
to
the
hard
labor
known
as
every
bale
was
turned
over
and
the
length
verified
to
ascertain
the
exact
value
of
the
remnant
the
ticket
attached
to
each
parcel
was
carefully
examined
to
see
at
what
time
the
piece
had
been
bought
the
retail
price
was
fixed
monsieur
guillaume
always
on
his
feet
his
pen
behind
his
ear
was
like
a
captain
commanding
the
working
of
the
ship
his
sharp
tones
spoken
through
a
to
inquire
into
the
depths
of
the
hold
in
the
gave
utterance
to
the
barbarous
formulas
of
which
find
expression
only
in
cipher
how
much
n
all
what
is
left
of
q
two
at
what
price
set
down
at

with
all
of
all
of

what
is
left
of
a
hundred

injunctions
equally
intelligible
were
spouted
over
the
counters
like
verses
of
modern
poetry
quoted
by
romantic
spirits
to
excite
each
other
s
enthusiasm
for
one
of
their
poets
in
the
evening
guillaume
shut
up
with
his
assistant
and
his
wife
balanced
his
accounts
carried
on
the
balance
wrote
to
debtors
in
arrears
and
made
out
bills
all
three
were
busy
over
this
enormous
labor
of
which
the
result
could
be
stated
on
a
sheet
of
foolscap
proving
to
the
head
of
the
house
that
there
was
so
much
to
the
good
in
hard
cash
so
much
in
goods
so
much
in
bills
and
notes
that
he
did
not
owe
a
sou
that
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
thousand
francs
were
owing
to
him
that
the
capital
had
been
increased
that
the
farmlands
the
houses
or
the
investments
were
extended
or
repaired
or
doubled
whence
it
became
necessary
to
begin
again
with
increased
ardor
to
accumulate
more
without
its
ever
entering
the
brain
of
these
laborious
ants
to
ask
to
what
end
favored
by
this
annual
turmoil
the
happy
augustine
escaped
the
investigations
of
her
relations
at
last
one
saturday
evening
the
was
finished
the
figures
of
the
showed
a
row
of
s
long
enough
to
allow
guillaume
for
once
to
relax
the
stern
rule
as
to
dessert
which
reigned
throughout
the
year
the
shrewd
old
draper
rubbed
his
hands
and
allowed
his
assistants
to
remain
at
table
the
members
of
the
crew
had
hardly
swallowed
their
thimbleful
of
some
liqueur
when
the
rumble
of
a
carriage
was
heard
the
family
party
were
going
to
see
at
the
varietes
while
the
two
younger
apprentices
each
received
a
crown
of
six
francs
with
permission
to
go
wherever
they
chose
provided
they
were
in
by
midnight
notwithstanding
this
debauch
the
old
was
shaving
himself
at
six
next
morning
put
on
his
coat
of
which
the
glowing
lights
afforded
him
perennial
enjoyment
fastened
a
pair
of
gold
buckles
on
the
of
his
ample
satin
breeches
and
then
at
about
seven
o
clock
while
all
were
still
sleeping
in
the
house
he
made
his
way
to
the
little
office
adjoining
the
shop
on
the
first
floor
daylight
came
in
through
a
window
fortified
by
iron
bars
and
looking
out
on
a
small
yard
surrounded
by
such
black
walls
that
it
was
very
like
a
well
the
old
merchant
opened
the
shutters
which
were
so
familiar
to
him
and
threw
up
the
lower
half
of
the
sash
window
the
icy
air
of
the
courtyard
came
in
to
cool
the
hot
atmosphere
of
the
little
room
full
of
the
odor
peculiar
to
offices
the
merchant
remained
standing
his
hand
resting
on
the
greasy
arm
of
a
large
cane
chair
lined
with
morocco
of
which
the
original
hue
had
disappeared
he
seemed
to
hesitate
as
to
seating
himself
he
looked
with
affection
at
the
double
desk
where
his
wife
s
seat
opposite
his
own
was
fitted
into
a
little
niche
in
the
wall
he
contemplated
the
numbered
boxes
the
files
the
implements
the
cash
box
objects
all
of
immemorial
origin
and
fancied
himself
in
the
room
with
the
shade
of
master
chevrel
he
even
pulled
out
the
high
stool
on
which
he
had
once
sat
in
the
presence
of
his
departed
master
this
stool
covered
with
black
leather
the
showing
at
every
corner
as
it
had
long
done
without
however
coming
out
he
placed
with
a
shaking
hand
on
the
very
spot
where
his
predecessor
had
put
it
and
then
with
an
emotion
difficult
to
describe
he
pulled
a
bell
which
rang
at
the
head
of
joseph
lebas
bed
when
this
decisive
blow
had
been
struck
the
old
man
for
whom
no
doubt
these
reminiscences
were
too
much
took
up
three
or
four
bills
of
exchange
and
looked
at
them
without
seeing
them
suddenly
joseph
lebas
stood
before
him
sit
down
there
said
guillaume
pointing
to
the
stool
as
the
old
master
draper
had
never
yet
bid
his
assistant
be
seated
in
his
presence
joseph
lebas
was
startled
what
do
you
think
of
these
notes
asked
guillaume
they
will
never
be
why
well
i
heard
the
day
before
yesterday
etienne
and
had
made
their
payments
in
oh
oh
said
the
draper
well
one
must
be
very
ill
to
show
one
s
bile
let
us
speak
of
something
joseph
the
is
yes
monsieur
and
the
dividend
is
one
of
the
best
you
have
ever
do
not
use
words
say
the
profits
joseph
do
you
know
my
boy
that
this
result
is
partly
owing
to
you
and
i
do
not
intend
to
pay
you
a
salary
any
longer
madame
guillaume
has
suggested
to
me
to
take
you
into
guillaume
and
lebas
will
not
that
make
a
good
business
name
we
might
add
and
to
round
off
the
firm
s
tears
rose
to
the
eyes
of
joseph
lebas
who
tried
to
hide
them
oh
monsieur
guillaume
how
have
i
deserved
such
kindness
i
only
do
my
duty
it
was
so
much
already
that
you
should
take
an
interest
in
a
poor
orph
he
was
brushing
the
cuff
of
his
left
sleeve
with
his
right
hand
and
dared
not
look
at
the
old
man
who
smiled
as
he
thought
that
this
modest
young
fellow
no
doubt
needed
as
he
had
needed
once
on
a
time
some
encouragement
to
complete
his
explanation
to
be
sure
said
virginie
s
father
you
do
not
altogether
deserve
this
favor
joseph
you
have
not
so
much
confidence
in
me
as
i
have
in
the
young
man
looked
up
quickly
you
know
all
the
secrets
of
the
for
the
last
two
years
i
have
told
you
almost
all
my
concerns
i
have
sent
you
to
travel
in
our
goods
in
short
i
have
nothing
on
my
conscience
as
regards
you
but
you
you
have
a
soft
place
and
you
have
never
breathed
a
word
of
joseph
lebas
blushed
ah
ha
cried
guillaume
so
you
thought
you
could
deceive
an
old
fox
like
me
when
you
knew
that
i
had
scented
the
lecocq
bankruptcy
what
monsieur
replied
joseph
lebas
looking
at
his
master
as
keenly
as
his
master
looked
at
him
you
knew
that
i
was
in
love
i
know
everything
you
rascal
said
the
worthy
and
cunning
old
merchant
pulling
the
assistant
s
ear
and
i
forgive
you
i
did
the
same
and
you
will
give
her
to
me
yes
with
fifty
thousand
crowns
and
i
will
leave
you
as
much
by
will
and
we
will
start
on
our
new
career
under
the
name
of
a
new
firm
we
will
do
good
business
yet
my
boy
added
the
old
man
getting
up
and
flourishing
his
arms
i
tell
you
there
is
nothing
like
trade
those
who
ask
what
pleasure
is
to
be
found
in
it
are
simpletons
to
be
on
the
scent
of
a
good
bargain
to
hold
your
own
on
change
to
watch
as
anxiously
as
at
the
whether
etienne
and
will
fail
or
no
to
see
a
regiment
of
guards
march
past
all
dressed
in
your
cloth
to
trip
your
neighbor
up
honestly
of
course
to
make
the
goods
cheaper
than
others
can
then
to
carry
out
an
undertaking
which
you
have
planned
which
begins
grows
totters
and
succeeds
to
know
the
workings
of
every
house
of
business
as
well
as
a
minister
of
police
so
as
never
to
make
a
mistake
to
hold
up
your
head
in
the
midst
of
wrecks
to
have
friends
by
correspondence
in
every
manufacturing
town
is
not
that
a
perpetual
game
joseph
that
is
life
that
is
i
shall
die
in
that
harness
like
old
chevrel
but
taking
it
easy
now
all
the
in
the
heat
of
his
eager
rhetoric
old
guillaume
had
scarcely
looked
at
his
assistant
who
was
weeping
copiously
why
joseph
my
poor
boy
what
is
the
matter
oh
i
love
her
so
monsieur
guillaume
that
my
heart
fails
me
i
believe
well
well
boy
said
the
old
man
touched
you
are
happier
than
you
know
by
god
for
she
loves
you
i
know
and
he
blinked
his
little
green
eyes
as
he
looked
at
the
young
man
mademoiselle
augustine
mademoiselle
augustine
exclaimed
joseph
lebas
in
his
rapture
he
was
about
to
rush
out
of
the
room
when
he
felt
himself
clutched
by
a
hand
of
iron
and
his
astonished
master
spun
him
round
in
front
of
him
once
more
what
has
augustine
to
do
with
this
matter
he
asked
in
a
voice
which
instantly
froze
the
luckless
joseph
is
it
not
she
that
that
i
love
stammered
the
assistant
much
put
out
by
his
own
want
of
perspicacity
guillaume
sat
down
again
and
rested
his
long
head
in
his
hands
to
consider
the
perplexing
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
joseph
lebas
shamefaced
and
in
despair
remained
standing
joseph
the
draper
said
with
frigid
dignity
i
was
speaking
of
virginie
love
can
not
be
made
to
order
i
know
i
know
too
that
you
can
be
trusted
we
will
forget
all
this
i
will
not
let
augustine
marry
before
your
interest
will
be
ten
per
the
young
man
to
whom
love
gave
i
know
not
what
power
of
courage
and
eloquence
clasped
his
hand
and
spoke
in
his
turn
spoke
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
so
much
warmth
and
feeling
that
he
altered
the
situation
if
the
question
had
been
a
matter
of
business
the
old
tradesman
would
have
had
fixed
principles
to
guide
his
decision
but
tossed
a
thousand
miles
from
commerce
on
the
ocean
of
sentiment
without
a
compass
he
floated
as
he
told
himself
undecided
in
the
face
of
such
an
unexpected
event
carried
away
by
his
fatherly
kindness
he
began
to
beat
about
the
bush
deuce
take
it
joseph
you
must
know
that
there
are
ten
years
between
my
two
children
mademoiselle
chevrel
was
no
beauty
still
she
has
had
nothing
to
complain
of
in
me
do
as
i
did
come
come
don
t
cry
can
you
be
so
silly
what
is
to
be
done
it
can
be
managed
perhaps
there
is
always
some
way
out
of
a
scrape
and
we
men
are
not
always
devoted
celadons
to
our
wives
you
understand
madame
guillaume
is
very
pious
come
by
gad
boy
give
your
arm
to
augustine
this
morning
as
we
go
to
these
were
the
phrases
spoken
at
random
by
the
old
draper
and
their
conclusion
made
the
lover
happy
he
was
already
thinking
of
a
friend
of
his
as
a
match
for
mademoiselle
virginie
as
he
went
out
of
the
smoky
office
pressing
his
future
s
hand
after
saying
with
a
knowing
look
that
all
would
turn
out
for
the
best
what
will
madame
guillaume
say
to
it
was
the
idea
that
greatly
troubled
the
worthy
merchant
when
he
found
himself
alone
at
breakfast
madame
guillaume
and
virginie
to
whom
the
draper
had
not
yet
confided
his
disappointment
cast
meaning
glances
at
joseph
lebas
who
was
extremely
embarrassed
the
young
assistant
s
bashfulness
commended
him
to
his
s
good
graces
the
matron
became
so
cheerful
that
she
smiled
as
she
looked
at
her
husband
and
allowed
herself
some
little
pleasantries
of
acceptance
in
such
simple
families
she
wondered
whether
joseph
or
virginie
were
the
taller
to
ask
them
to
compare
their
height
this
preliminary
fooling
brought
a
cloud
to
the
master
s
brow
and
he
even
made
such
a
point
of
decorum
that
he
desired
augustine
to
take
the
assistant
s
arm
on
their
way
to
madame
guillaume
surprised
at
this
manly
delicacy
honored
her
husband
with
a
nod
of
approval
so
the
procession
left
the
house
in
such
order
as
to
suggest
no
suspicious
meaning
to
the
neighbors
does
it
not
seem
to
you
mademoiselle
augustine
said
the
assistant
and
he
trembled
that
the
wife
of
a
merchant
whose
credit
is
as
good
as
monsieur
guillaume
s
for
instance
might
enjoy
herself
a
little
more
than
madame
your
mother
does
might
wear
diamonds
or
keep
a
carriage
for
my
part
if
i
were
to
marry
i
should
be
glad
to
take
all
the
work
and
see
my
wife
happy
i
would
not
put
her
into
the
in
the
drapery
business
you
see
a
woman
is
not
so
necessary
now
as
formerly
monsieur
guillaume
was
quite
right
to
act
as
he
did
and
besides
his
wife
liked
it
but
so
long
as
a
woman
knows
how
to
turn
her
hand
to
the
the
correspondence
the
retail
business
the
orders
and
her
housekeeping
so
as
not
to
sit
idle
that
is
enough
at
seven
o
clock
when
the
shop
is
shut
i
shall
take
my
pleasures
go
to
the
play
and
into
but
you
are
not
listening
to
yes
indeed
monsieur
joseph
what
do
you
think
of
painting
that
is
a
fine
yes
i
know
a
master
monsieur
lourdois
he
is
thus
conversing
the
family
reached
the
church
of
there
madame
guillaume
reasserted
her
rights
and
for
the
first
time
placed
augustine
next
herself
virginie
taking
her
place
on
the
fourth
chair
next
to
lebas
during
the
sermon
all
went
well
between
augustine
and
theodore
who
standing
behind
a
pillar
worshiped
his
madonna
with
fervent
devotion
but
at
the
elevation
of
the
host
madame
guillaume
discovered
rather
late
that
her
daughter
augustine
was
holding
her
upside
down
she
was
about
to
speak
to
her
strongly
when
lowering
her
veil
she
interrupted
her
own
devotions
to
look
in
the
direction
where
her
daughter
s
eyes
found
attraction
by
the
help
of
her
spectacles
she
saw
the
young
artist
whose
fashionable
elegance
seemed
to
proclaim
him
a
cavalry
officer
on
leave
rather
than
a
tradesman
of
the
neighborhood
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
the
state
of
violent
agitation
in
which
madame
guillaume
found
herself
she
who
flattered
herself
on
having
brought
up
her
daughters
to
perfection
on
discovering
in
augustine
a
clandestine
passion
of
which
her
prudery
and
ignorance
exaggerated
the
perils
she
believed
her
daughter
to
be
cankered
to
the
core
hold
your
book
right
way
up
miss
she
muttered
in
a
low
voice
tremulous
with
wrath
she
snatched
away
the
and
returned
it
with
the
right
way
up
do
not
allow
your
eyes
to
look
anywhere
but
at
your
prayers
she
added
or
i
shall
have
something
to
say
to
you
your
father
and
i
will
talk
to
you
after
these
words
came
like
a
thunderbolt
on
poor
augustine
she
felt
faint
but
torn
between
the
distress
she
felt
and
the
dread
of
causing
a
commotion
in
church
she
bravely
concealed
her
anguish
it
was
however
easy
to
discern
the
stormy
state
of
her
soul
from
the
trembling
of
her
and
the
tears
which
dropped
on
every
page
she
turned
from
the
furious
glare
shot
at
him
by
madame
guillaume
the
artist
saw
the
peril
into
which
his
love
affair
had
fallen
he
went
out
with
a
raging
soul
determined
to
venture
all
go
to
your
room
miss
said
madame
guillaume
on
their
return
home
we
will
send
for
you
but
take
care
not
to
quit
the
conference
between
the
husband
and
wife
was
conducted
so
secretly
that
at
first
nothing
was
heard
of
it
virginie
however
who
had
tried
to
give
her
sister
courage
by
a
variety
of
gentle
remonstrances
carried
her
good
nature
so
far
as
to
listen
at
the
door
of
her
mother
s
bedroom
where
the
discussion
was
held
to
catch
a
word
or
two
the
first
time
she
went
down
to
the
lower
floor
she
heard
her
father
exclaim
then
madame
do
you
wish
to
kill
your
daughter
my
poor
dear
said
virginie
in
tears
papa
takes
your
and
what
do
they
want
to
do
to
theodore
asked
the
innocent
girl
virginie
inquisitive
went
down
again
but
this
time
she
stayed
longer
she
learned
that
joseph
lebas
loved
augustine
it
was
written
that
on
this
memorable
day
this
house
generally
so
peaceful
should
be
a
hell
monsieur
guillaume
brought
joseph
lebas
to
despair
by
telling
him
of
augustine
s
love
for
a
stranger
lebas
who
had
advised
his
friend
to
become
a
suitor
for
mademoiselle
virginie
saw
all
his
hopes
wrecked
mademoiselle
virginie
overcome
by
hearing
that
joseph
had
in
a
way
refused
her
had
a
sick
headache
the
dispute
that
had
arisen
from
the
discussion
between
monsieur
and
madame
guillaume
when
for
the
third
time
in
their
lives
they
had
been
of
antagonistic
opinions
had
shown
itself
in
a
terrible
form
finally
at
four
in
the
afternoon
augustine
pale
trembling
and
with
red
eyes
was
haled
before
her
father
and
mother
the
poor
child
artlessly
related
the
too
brief
tale
of
her
love
reassured
by
a
speech
from
her
father
who
promised
to
listen
to
her
in
silence
she
gathered
courage
as
she
pronounced
to
her
parents
the
name
of
theodore
de
sommervieux
with
a
mischievous
little
emphasis
on
the
aristocratic
and
yielding
to
the
unknown
charm
of
talking
of
her
feelings
she
was
brave
enough
to
declare
with
innocent
decision
that
she
loved
monsieur
de
sommervieux
that
she
had
written
to
him
and
she
added
with
tears
in
her
eyes
to
sacrifice
me
to
another
man
would
make
me
but
augustine
you
can
not
surely
know
what
a
painter
is
cried
her
mother
with
horror
madame
guillaume
said
the
old
man
compelling
her
to
augustine
he
went
on
artists
are
generally
little
better
than
beggars
they
are
too
extravagant
not
to
be
always
a
bad
sort
i
served
the
late
monsieur
joseph
vernet
the
late
monsieur
lekain
and
the
late
monsieur
noverre
oh
if
you
could
only
know
the
tricks
played
on
poor
father
chevrel
by
that
monsieur
noverre
by
the
chevalier
de
and
especially
by
monsieur
philidor
they
are
a
set
of
rascals
i
know
them
well
they
all
have
a
gab
and
nice
manners
ah
your
monsieur
sumer
somm
de
sommervieux
well
well
de
sommervieux
well
and
good
he
can
never
have
been
half
so
sweet
to
you
as
monsieur
le
chevalier
de
was
to
me
the
day
i
got
a
verdict
of
the
consuls
against
him
and
in
those
days
they
were
gentlemen
of
but
father
monsieur
theodore
is
of
good
family
and
he
wrote
me
that
he
is
rich
his
father
was
called
chevalier
de
sommervieux
before
the
at
these
words
monsieur
guillaume
looked
at
his
terrible
better
half
who
like
an
angry
woman
sat
tapping
the
floor
with
her
foot
while
keeping
sullen
silence
she
avoided
even
casting
wrathful
looks
at
augustine
appearing
to
leave
to
monsieur
guillaume
the
whole
responsibility
in
so
grave
a
matter
since
her
opinion
was
not
listened
to
nevertheless
in
spite
of
her
apparent
when
she
saw
her
husband
giving
way
so
mildly
under
a
catastrophe
which
had
no
concern
with
business
she
exclaimed
really
monsieur
you
are
so
weak
with
your
daughters
however
the
sound
of
a
carriage
which
stopped
at
the
door
interrupted
the
rating
which
the
old
draper
already
quaked
at
in
a
minute
madame
roguin
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looking
at
the
actors
in
this
domestic
scene
i
know
all
my
dear
cousin
said
she
with
a
patronizing
air
madame
roguin
made
the
great
mistake
of
supposing
that
a
paris
notary
s
wife
could
play
the
part
of
a
favorite
of
fashion
i
know
all
she
repeated
and
i
have
come
into
noah
s
ark
like
the
dove
with
the
i
read
that
allegory
in
the
du
she
added
turning
to
madame
guillaume
the
allusion
ought
to
please
you
cousin
do
you
know
she
went
on
smiling
at
augustine
that
monsieur
de
sommervieux
is
a
charming
man
he
gave
me
my
portrait
this
morning
painted
by
a
master
s
hand
it
is
worth
at
least
six
thousand
and
at
these
words
she
patted
monsieur
guillaume
on
the
arm
the
old
draper
could
not
help
making
a
grimace
with
his
lips
which
was
peculiar
to
him
i
know
monsieur
de
sommervieux
very
well
the
dove
ran
on
he
has
come
to
my
evenings
this
fortnight
past
and
made
them
delightful
he
has
told
me
all
his
woes
and
commissioned
me
to
plead
for
him
i
know
since
this
morning
that
he
adores
augustine
and
he
shall
have
her
ah
cousin
do
not
shake
your
head
in
refusal
he
will
be
created
baron
i
can
tell
you
and
has
just
been
made
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honor
by
the
emperor
himself
at
the
salon
roguin
is
now
his
lawyer
and
knows
all
his
affairs
well
monsieur
de
sommervieux
has
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
in
good
landed
estate
do
you
know
that
the
of
such
a
man
may
get
a
rise
in
life
be
mayor
of
his
for
instance
have
we
not
seen
monsieur
dupont
become
a
count
of
the
empire
and
a
senator
all
because
he
went
as
mayor
to
congratulate
the
emperor
on
his
entry
into
vienna
oh
this
marriage
must
take
place
for
my
part
i
adore
the
dear
young
man
his
behavior
to
augustine
is
only
met
with
in
romances
be
easy
little
one
you
shall
be
happy
and
every
girl
will
wish
she
were
in
your
place
madame
la
duchesse
de
carigliano
who
comes
to
my
at
homes
raves
about
monsieur
de
sommervieux
some
spiteful
people
say
she
only
comes
to
me
to
meet
him
as
if
a
duchesse
of
yesterday
was
doing
too
much
honor
to
a
chevrel
whose
family
have
been
respected
citizens
these
hundred
years
augustine
madame
roguin
went
on
after
a
short
pause
i
have
seen
the
portrait
heavens
how
lovely
it
is
do
you
know
that
the
emperor
wanted
to
have
it
he
laughed
and
said
to
the
deputy
high
constable
that
if
there
were
many
women
like
that
in
his
court
while
all
the
kings
visited
it
he
should
have
no
difficulty
about
preserving
the
peace
of
europe
is
not
that
a
compliment
the
tempests
with
which
the
day
had
begun
were
to
resemble
those
of
nature
by
ending
in
clear
and
serene
weather
madame
roguin
displayed
so
much
address
in
her
harangue
she
was
able
to
touch
so
many
strings
in
the
dry
hearts
of
monsieur
and
madame
guillaume
that
at
last
she
hit
on
one
which
she
could
work
upon
at
this
strange
period
commerce
and
finance
were
more
than
ever
possessed
by
the
crazy
mania
for
seeking
alliance
with
rank
and
the
generals
of
the
empire
took
full
advantage
of
this
desire
monsieur
guillaume
as
a
singular
exception
opposed
this
deplorable
craving
his
favorite
axioms
were
that
to
secure
happiness
a
woman
must
marry
a
man
of
her
own
class
that
every
one
was
punished
sooner
or
later
for
having
climbed
too
high
that
love
could
so
little
endure
under
the
worries
of
a
household
that
both
husband
and
wife
needed
sound
good
qualities
to
be
happy
that
it
would
not
do
for
one
to
be
far
in
advance
of
the
other
because
above
everything
they
must
understand
each
other
if
a
man
spoke
greek
and
his
wife
latin
they
might
come
to
die
of
hunger
he
had
himself
invented
this
sort
of
adage
and
he
compared
such
marriages
to
materials
of
mixed
silk
and
wool
still
there
is
so
much
vanity
at
the
bottom
of
man
s
heart
that
the
prudence
of
the
pilot
who
steered
the
cat
and
racket
so
wisely
gave
way
before
madame
roguin
s
aggressive
volubility
austere
madame
guillaume
was
the
first
to
see
in
her
daughter
s
affection
a
reason
for
abdicating
her
principles
and
for
consenting
to
receive
monsieur
de
sommervieux
whom
she
promised
herself
she
would
put
under
severe
inquisition
the
old
draper
went
to
look
for
joseph
lebas
and
inform
him
of
the
state
of
affairs
at
six
the
immortalized
by
the
artist
saw
united
under
its
skylight
monsieur
and
madame
roguin
the
young
painter
and
his
charming
augustine
joseph
lebas
who
found
his
happiness
in
patience
and
mademoiselle
virginie
convalescent
from
her
headache
monsieur
and
madame
guillaume
saw
in
perspective
both
their
children
married
and
the
fortunes
of
the
cat
and
racket
once
more
in
skilful
hands
their
satisfaction
was
at
its
height
when
at
dessert
theodore
made
them
a
present
of
the
wonderful
picture
which
they
had
failed
to
see
representing
the
interior
of
the
old
shop
and
to
which
they
all
owed
so
much
happiness
isn
t
it
pretty
cried
guillaume
and
to
think
that
any
one
would
pay
thirty
thousand
francs
for
that
because
you
can
see
my
lappets
in
it
said
madame
guillaume
and
the
cloth
unrolled
added
lebas
you
might
take
it
up
in
your
drapery
always
comes
out
well
replied
the
painter
we
should
be
only
too
happy
we
modern
artists
if
we
could
touch
the
perfection
of
antique
so
you
like
drapery
cried
old
guillaume
well
then
by
gad
shake
hands
on
that
my
young
friend
since
you
can
respect
trade
we
shall
understand
each
other
and
why
should
it
be
despised
the
world
began
with
trade
since
adam
sold
paradise
for
an
apple
he
did
not
strike
a
good
bargain
though
and
the
old
man
roared
with
honest
laughter
encouraged
by
the
champagne
which
he
sent
round
with
a
liberal
hand
the
band
that
covered
the
young
artist
s
eyes
was
so
thick
that
he
thought
his
future
parents
amiable
he
was
not
above
enlivening
them
by
a
few
jests
in
the
best
taste
so
he
too
pleased
every
one
in
the
evening
when
the
furnished
with
what
madame
guillaume
called
everything
handsome
was
deserted
and
while
she
flitted
from
the
table
to
the
from
the
candelabra
to
the
tall
candlesticks
hastily
blowing
out
the
the
worthy
draper
who
was
always
when
money
was
in
question
called
augustine
to
him
and
seating
her
on
his
knee
spoke
as
follows
my
dear
child
you
shall
marry
your
sommervieux
since
you
insist
you
may
if
you
like
risk
your
capital
in
happiness
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
hoodwinked
by
the
thirty
thousand
francs
to
be
made
by
spoiling
good
canvas
money
that
is
lightly
earned
is
lightly
spent
did
i
not
hear
that
youngster
declare
this
evening
that
money
was
made
round
that
it
might
roll
if
it
is
round
for
spendthrifts
it
is
flat
for
saving
folks
who
pile
it
up
now
my
child
that
fine
gentleman
talks
of
giving
you
carriages
and
diamonds
he
has
money
let
him
spend
it
on
you
so
be
it
it
is
no
concern
of
mine
but
as
to
what
i
can
give
you
i
will
not
have
the
i
have
picked
up
with
so
much
toil
wasted
in
carriages
and
frippery
those
who
spend
too
fast
never
grow
rich
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
which
is
your
fortune
will
not
buy
up
paris
it
is
all
very
well
to
look
forward
to
a
few
hundred
thousand
francs
to
be
yours
some
day
i
shall
keep
you
waiting
for
them
as
long
as
possible
by
gad
so
i
took
your
lover
aside
and
a
man
who
managed
the
lecocq
bankruptcy
had
not
much
difficulty
in
persuading
the
artist
to
marry
under
a
settlement
of
his
wife
s
money
on
herself
i
will
keep
an
eye
on
the
marriage
contract
to
see
that
what
he
is
to
settle
on
you
is
safely
tied
up
so
now
my
child
i
hope
to
be
a
grandfather
by
gad
i
will
begin
at
once
to
lay
up
for
my
grandchildren
but
swear
to
me
here
and
now
never
to
sign
any
papers
relating
to
money
without
my
advice
and
if
i
go
soon
to
join
old
father
chevrel
promise
to
consult
young
lebas
your
yes
father
i
swear
at
these
words
spoken
in
a
gentle
voice
the
old
man
kissed
his
daughter
on
both
cheeks
that
night
the
lovers
slept
as
soundly
as
monsieur
and
madame
guillaume
some
few
months
after
this
memorable
sunday
the
high
altar
of
was
the
scene
of
two
very
different
weddings
augustine
and
theodore
appeared
in
all
the
radiance
of
happiness
their
eyes
beaming
with
love
dressed
with
elegance
while
a
fine
carriage
waited
for
them
virginie
who
had
come
in
a
good
hired
fly
with
the
rest
of
the
family
humbly
followed
her
younger
sister
dressed
in
the
simplest
fashion
like
a
shadow
necessary
to
the
harmony
of
the
picture
monsieur
guillaume
had
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
in
the
church
to
get
virginie
married
before
augustine
but
the
priests
high
and
low
persisted
in
addressing
the
more
elegant
of
the
two
brides
he
heard
some
of
his
neighbors
highly
approving
the
good
sense
of
mademoiselle
virginie
who
was
making
as
they
said
the
more
substantial
match
and
remaining
faithful
to
the
neighborhood
while
they
fired
a
few
taunts
prompted
by
envy
of
augustine
who
was
marrying
an
artist
and
a
man
of
rank
adding
with
a
sort
of
dismay
that
if
the
guillaumes
were
ambitious
there
was
an
end
to
the
business
an
old
having
remarked
that
such
a
prodigal
would
soon
bring
his
wife
to
beggary
father
guillaume
prided
himself
for
his
prudence
in
the
matter
of
marriage
settlements
in
the
evening
after
a
splendid
ball
followed
by
one
of
those
substantial
suppers
of
which
the
memory
is
dying
out
in
the
present
generation
monsieur
and
madame
guillaume
remained
in
a
fine
house
belonging
to
them
in
the
rue
du
colombier
where
the
wedding
had
been
held
monsieur
and
madame
lebas
returned
in
their
fly
to
the
old
home
in
the
rue
to
steer
the
good
ship
cat
and
racket
the
artist
intoxicated
with
happiness
carried
off
his
beloved
augustine
and
eagerly
lifting
her
out
of
their
carriage
when
it
reached
the
rue
des
led
her
to
an
apartment
embellished
by
all
the
arts
the
fever
of
passion
which
possessed
theodore
made
a
year
fly
over
the
young
couple
without
a
single
cloud
to
dim
the
blue
sky
under
which
they
lived
life
did
not
hang
heavy
on
the
lovers
hands
theodore
lavished
on
every
day
inexhaustible
of
enjoyment
and
he
delighted
to
vary
the
transports
of
passion
by
the
soft
languor
of
those
hours
of
repose
when
souls
soar
so
high
that
they
seem
to
have
forgotten
all
bodily
union
augustine
was
too
happy
for
reflection
she
floated
on
an
undulating
tide
of
rapture
she
thought
she
could
not
do
enough
by
abandoning
herself
to
sanctioned
and
sacred
married
love
simple
and
artless
she
had
no
coquetry
no
reserves
none
of
the
dominion
which
a
girl
acquires
over
her
husband
by
ingenious
caprice
she
loved
too
well
to
calculate
for
the
future
and
never
imagined
that
so
exquisite
a
life
could
come
to
an
end
happy
in
being
her
husband
s
sole
delight
she
believed
that
her
inextinguishable
love
would
always
be
her
greatest
grace
in
his
eyes
as
her
devotion
and
obedience
would
be
a
perennial
charm
and
indeed
the
ecstasy
of
love
had
made
her
so
brilliantly
lovely
that
her
beauty
filled
her
with
pride
and
gave
her
confidence
that
she
could
always
reign
over
a
man
so
easy
to
kindle
as
monsieur
de
sommervieux
thus
her
position
as
a
wife
brought
her
no
knowledge
but
the
lessons
of
love
in
the
midst
of
her
happiness
she
was
still
the
simple
child
who
had
lived
in
obscurity
in
the
rue
and
who
never
thought
of
acquiring
the
manners
the
information
the
tone
of
the
world
she
had
to
live
in
her
words
being
the
words
of
love
she
revealed
in
them
no
doubt
a
certain
pliancy
of
mind
and
a
certain
refinement
of
speech
but
she
used
the
language
common
to
all
women
when
they
find
themselves
plunged
in
passion
which
seems
to
be
their
element
when
by
chance
augustine
expressed
an
idea
that
did
not
harmonize
with
theodore
s
the
young
artist
laughed
as
we
laugh
at
the
first
mistakes
of
a
foreigner
though
they
end
by
annoying
us
if
they
are
not
corrected
in
spite
of
all
this
by
the
end
of
this
year
as
delightful
as
it
was
swift
sommervieux
felt
one
morning
the
need
for
resuming
his
work
and
his
old
habits
his
wife
was
expecting
their
first
child
he
saw
some
friends
again
during
the
tedious
discomforts
of
the
year
when
a
young
wife
is
nursing
an
infant
for
the
first
time
he
worked
no
doubt
with
zeal
but
he
occasionally
sought
diversion
in
the
fashionable
world
the
house
which
he
was
best
pleased
to
frequent
was
that
of
the
duchesse
de
carigliano
who
had
at
last
attracted
the
celebrated
artist
to
her
parties
when
augustine
was
quite
well
again
and
her
boy
no
longer
required
the
assiduous
care
which
debars
a
mother
from
social
pleasures
theodore
had
come
to
the
stage
of
wishing
to
know
the
joys
of
satisfied
vanity
to
be
found
in
society
by
a
man
who
shows
himself
with
a
handsome
woman
the
object
of
envy
and
admiration
to
figure
in
with
the
reflected
lustre
of
her
husband
s
fame
and
to
find
other
women
envious
of
her
was
to
augustine
a
new
harvest
of
pleasures
but
it
was
the
last
gleam
of
conjugal
happiness
she
first
wounded
her
husband
s
vanity
when
in
spite
of
vain
efforts
she
betrayed
her
ignorance
the
inelegance
of
her
language
and
the
narrowness
of
her
ideas
sommervieux
s
nature
subjugated
for
nearly
two
years
and
a
half
by
the
first
transports
of
love
now
in
the
calm
of
less
new
possession
recovered
its
bent
and
habits
for
a
while
diverted
from
their
channel
poetry
painting
and
the
subtle
joys
of
imagination
have
inalienable
rights
over
a
lofty
spirit
these
cravings
of
a
powerful
soul
had
not
been
starved
in
theodore
during
these
two
years
they
had
only
found
fresh
pasture
as
soon
as
the
meadows
of
love
had
been
ransacked
and
the
artist
had
gathered
roses
and
cornflowers
as
the
children
do
so
greedily
that
he
did
not
see
that
his
hands
could
hold
no
more
the
scene
changed
when
the
painter
showed
his
wife
the
sketches
for
his
finest
compositions
he
heard
her
exclaim
as
her
father
had
done
how
pretty
this
tepid
admiration
was
not
the
outcome
of
conscientious
feeling
but
of
her
faith
on
the
strength
of
love
augustine
cared
more
for
a
look
than
for
the
finest
picture
the
only
sublime
she
knew
was
that
of
the
heart
at
last
theodore
could
not
resist
the
evidence
of
the
cruel
fact
his
wife
was
insensible
to
poetry
she
did
not
dwell
in
his
sphere
she
could
not
follow
him
in
all
his
vagaries
his
inventions
his
joys
and
his
sorrows
she
walked
groveling
in
the
world
of
reality
while
his
head
was
in
the
skies
common
minds
can
not
appreciate
the
perennial
sufferings
of
a
being
who
while
bound
to
another
by
the
most
intimate
affections
is
obliged
constantly
to
suppress
the
dearest
flights
of
his
soul
and
to
thrust
down
into
the
void
those
images
which
a
magic
power
compels
him
to
create
to
him
the
torture
is
all
the
more
intolerable
because
his
feeling
towards
his
companion
enjoins
as
its
first
law
that
they
should
have
no
concealments
but
mingle
the
aspirations
of
their
thought
as
perfectly
as
the
effusions
of
their
soul
the
demands
of
nature
are
not
to
be
cheated
she
is
as
inexorable
as
necessity
which
is
indeed
a
sort
of
social
nature
sommervieux
took
refuge
in
the
peace
and
silence
of
his
studio
hoping
that
the
habit
of
living
with
artists
might
mould
his
wife
and
develop
in
her
the
dormant
germs
of
lofty
intelligence
which
some
superior
minds
suppose
must
exist
in
every
being
but
augustine
was
too
sincerely
religious
not
to
take
fright
at
the
tone
of
artists
at
the
first
dinner
theodore
gave
she
heard
a
young
painter
say
with
the
childlike
lightness
which
to
her
was
unintelligible
and
which
redeems
a
jest
from
the
taint
of
profanity
but
madame
your
paradise
can
not
be
more
beautiful
than
raphael
s
transfiguration
well
and
i
got
tired
of
looking
at
thus
augustine
came
among
this
sparkling
set
in
a
spirit
of
distrust
which
no
one
could
fail
to
see
she
was
a
restraint
on
their
freedom
now
an
artist
who
feels
restraint
is
pitiless
he
stays
away
or
laughs
it
to
scorn
madame
guillaume
among
other
absurdities
had
an
excessive
notion
of
the
dignity
she
considered
the
prerogative
of
a
married
woman
and
augustine
though
she
had
often
made
fun
of
it
could
not
help
a
slight
imitation
of
her
mother
s
primness
this
extreme
propriety
which
virtuous
wives
do
not
always
avoid
suggested
a
few
epigrams
in
the
form
of
sketches
in
which
the
harmless
jest
was
in
such
good
taste
that
sommervieux
could
not
take
offence
and
even
if
they
had
been
more
severe
these
pleasantries
were
after
all
only
reprisals
from
his
friends
still
nothing
could
seem
a
trifle
to
a
spirit
so
open
as
theodore
s
to
impressions
from
without
a
coldness
insensibly
crept
over
him
and
inevitably
spread
to
attain
conjugal
happiness
we
must
climb
a
hill
whose
summit
is
a
narrow
ridge
close
to
a
steep
and
slippery
descent
the
painter
s
love
was
falling
down
it
he
regarded
his
wife
as
incapable
of
appreciating
the
moral
considerations
which
justified
him
in
his
own
eyes
for
his
singular
behavior
to
her
and
believed
himself
quite
innocent
in
hiding
from
her
thoughts
she
could
not
enter
into
and
peccadilloes
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
a
conscience
augustine
wrapped
herself
in
sullen
and
silent
grief
these
unconfessed
feelings
placed
a
shroud
between
the
husband
and
wife
which
could
not
fail
to
grow
thicker
day
by
day
though
her
husband
never
failed
in
consideration
for
her
augustine
could
not
help
trembling
as
she
saw
that
he
kept
for
the
outer
world
those
treasures
of
wit
and
grace
that
he
formerly
would
lay
at
her
feet
she
soon
began
to
find
sinister
meaning
in
the
jocular
speeches
that
are
current
in
the
world
as
to
the
inconstancy
of
men
she
made
no
complaints
but
her
demeanor
conveyed
reproach
three
years
after
her
marriage
this
pretty
young
woman
who
dashed
past
in
her
handsome
carriage
and
lived
in
a
sphere
of
glory
and
riches
to
the
envy
of
heedless
folk
incapable
of
taking
a
just
view
of
the
situations
of
life
was
a
prey
to
intense
grief
she
lost
her
color
she
reflected
she
made
comparisons
then
sorrow
unfolded
to
her
the
first
lessons
of
experience
she
determined
to
restrict
herself
bravely
within
the
round
of
duty
hoping
that
by
this
generous
conduct
she
might
sooner
or
later
win
back
her
husband
s
love
but
it
was
not
so
when
sommervieux
fired
with
work
came
in
from
his
studio
augustine
did
not
put
away
her
work
so
quickly
but
that
the
painter
might
find
his
wife
mending
the
household
linen
and
his
own
with
all
the
care
of
a
good
housewife
she
supplied
generously
and
without
a
murmur
the
money
needed
for
his
lavishness
but
in
her
anxiety
to
husband
her
dear
theodore
s
fortune
she
was
strictly
economical
for
herself
and
in
certain
details
of
domestic
management
such
conduct
is
incompatible
with
the
habits
of
artists
who
at
the
end
of
their
life
have
enjoyed
it
so
keenly
that
they
never
inquire
into
the
causes
of
their
ruin
it
is
useless
to
note
every
tint
of
shadow
by
which
the
brilliant
hues
of
their
honeymoon
were
overcast
till
they
were
lost
in
utter
blackness
one
evening
poor
augustine
who
had
for
some
time
heard
her
husband
speak
with
enthusiasm
of
the
duchesse
de
carigliano
received
from
a
friend
certain
malignantly
charitable
warnings
as
to
the
nature
of
the
attachment
which
sommervieux
had
formed
for
this
celebrated
flirt
of
the
imperial
court
at
in
all
the
splendor
of
youth
and
beauty
augustine
saw
herself
deserted
for
a
woman
of
feeling
herself
so
wretched
in
the
midst
of
a
world
of
festivity
which
to
her
was
a
blank
the
poor
little
thing
could
no
longer
understand
the
admiration
she
excited
or
the
envy
of
which
she
was
the
object
her
face
assumed
a
different
expression
melancholy
tinged
her
features
with
the
sweetness
of
resignation
and
the
pallor
of
scorned
love
ere
long
she
too
was
courted
by
the
most
fascinating
men
but
she
remained
lonely
and
virtuous
some
contemptuous
words
which
escaped
her
husband
filled
her
with
incredible
despair
a
sinister
flash
showed
her
the
breaches
which
as
a
result
of
her
sordid
education
hindered
the
perfect
union
of
her
soul
with
theodore
s
she
loved
him
well
enough
to
absolve
him
and
condemn
herself
she
shed
tears
of
blood
and
perceived
too
late
that
there
are
of
the
spirit
as
well
as
of
rank
and
habits
as
she
recalled
the
early
raptures
of
their
union
she
understood
the
full
extent
of
that
lost
happiness
and
accepted
the
conclusion
that
so
rich
a
harvest
of
love
was
in
itself
a
whole
life
which
only
sorrow
could
pay
for
at
the
same
time
she
loved
too
truly
to
lose
all
hope
at
she
dared
undertake
to
educate
herself
and
make
her
imagination
at
least
worthy
of
that
she
admired
if
i
am
not
a
poet
thought
she
at
any
rate
i
will
understand
then
with
all
the
strength
of
will
all
the
energy
which
every
woman
can
display
when
she
loves
madame
de
sommervieux
tried
to
alter
her
character
her
manners
and
her
habits
but
by
dint
of
devouring
books
and
learning
undauntedly
she
only
succeeded
in
becoming
less
ignorant
lightness
of
wit
and
the
graces
of
conversation
are
a
gift
of
nature
or
the
fruit
of
education
begun
in
the
cradle
she
could
appreciate
music
and
enjoy
it
but
she
could
not
sing
with
taste
she
understood
literature
and
the
beauties
of
poetry
but
it
was
too
late
to
cultivate
her
refractory
memory
she
listened
with
pleasure
to
social
conversation
but
she
could
contribute
nothing
brilliant
her
religious
notions
and
prejudices
were
antagonistic
to
the
complete
emancipation
of
her
intelligence
finally
a
foregone
conclusion
against
her
had
stolen
into
theodore
s
mind
and
this
she
could
not
conquer
the
artist
would
laugh
at
those
who
flattered
him
about
his
wife
and
his
irony
had
some
foundation
he
so
overawed
the
pathetic
young
creature
that
in
his
presence
or
alone
with
him
she
trembled
hampered
by
her
too
eager
desire
to
please
her
wits
and
her
knowledge
vanished
in
one
absorbing
feeling
even
her
fidelity
vexed
the
unfaithful
husband
who
seemed
to
bid
her
do
wrong
by
stigmatizing
her
virtue
as
insensibility
augustine
tried
in
vain
to
abdicate
her
reason
to
yield
to
her
husband
s
caprices
and
whims
to
devote
herself
to
the
selfishness
of
his
vanity
her
sacrifices
bore
no
fruit
perhaps
they
had
both
let
the
moment
slip
when
souls
may
meet
in
comprehension
one
day
the
young
wife
s
too
sensitive
heart
received
one
of
those
blows
which
so
strain
the
bonds
of
feeling
that
they
seem
to
be
broken
she
withdrew
into
solitude
but
before
long
a
fatal
idea
suggested
to
her
to
seek
counsel
and
comfort
in
the
bosom
of
her
family
so
one
morning
she
made
her
way
towards
the
grotesque
facade
of
the
humble
silent
home
where
she
had
spent
her
childhood
she
sighed
as
she
looked
up
at
the
whence
one
day
she
had
sent
her
first
kiss
to
him
who
now
shed
as
much
sorrow
as
glory
on
her
life
nothing
was
changed
in
the
cavern
where
the
drapery
business
had
however
started
on
a
new
life
augustine
s
sister
filled
her
mother
s
old
place
at
the
desk
the
unhappy
young
woman
met
her
with
his
pen
behind
his
ear
he
hardly
listened
to
her
he
was
so
full
of
business
the
formidable
symptoms
of
were
visible
all
round
him
he
begged
her
to
excuse
him
she
was
received
coldly
enough
by
her
sister
who
owed
her
a
grudge
in
fact
augustine
in
her
finery
and
stepping
out
of
a
handsome
carriage
had
never
been
to
see
her
but
when
passing
by
the
wife
of
the
prudent
lebas
imagining
that
want
of
money
was
the
prime
cause
of
this
early
call
tried
to
keep
up
a
tone
of
reserve
which
more
than
once
made
augustine
smile
the
painter
s
wife
perceived
that
apart
from
the
cap
and
lappets
her
mother
had
found
in
virginie
a
successor
who
could
uphold
the
ancient
honor
of
the
cat
and
racket
at
breakfast
she
observed
certain
changes
in
the
management
of
the
house
which
did
honor
to
lebas
good
sense
the
assistants
did
not
rise
before
dessert
they
were
allowed
to
talk
and
the
abundant
meal
spoke
of
ease
without
luxury
the
fashionable
woman
found
some
tickets
for
a
box
at
the
francais
where
she
remembered
having
seen
her
sister
from
time
to
time
madame
lebas
had
a
cashmere
shawl
over
her
shoulders
of
which
the
value
bore
witness
to
her
husband
s
generosity
to
her
in
short
the
couple
were
keeping
pace
with
the
times
during
the
of
the
day
she
spent
there
augustine
was
touched
to
the
heart
by
the
equable
happiness
devoid
to
be
sure
of
all
emotion
but
equally
free
from
storms
enjoyed
by
this
couple
they
had
accepted
life
as
a
commercial
enterprise
in
which
above
all
they
must
do
credit
to
the
business
not
finding
any
great
love
in
her
husband
virginie
had
set
to
work
to
create
it
having
by
degrees
learned
to
esteem
and
care
for
his
wife
the
time
that
his
happiness
had
taken
to
germinate
was
to
joseph
lebas
a
guarantee
of
its
durability
hence
when
augustine
plaintively
set
forth
her
painful
position
she
had
to
face
the
deluge
of
commonplace
morality
which
the
traditions
of
the
rue
furnished
to
her
sister
the
mischief
is
done
wife
said
joseph
lebas
we
must
try
to
give
our
sister
good
then
the
clever
tradesman
ponderously
analyzed
the
resources
which
law
and
custom
might
offer
augustine
as
a
means
of
escape
at
this
crisis
he
ticketed
every
argument
so
to
speak
and
arranged
them
in
their
degrees
of
weight
under
various
categories
as
though
they
were
articles
of
merchandise
of
different
qualities
then
he
put
them
in
the
scale
weighed
them
and
ended
by
showing
the
necessity
for
his
s
taking
violent
steps
which
could
not
satisfy
the
love
she
still
had
for
her
husband
and
indeed
the
feeling
had
revived
in
all
its
strength
when
she
heard
joseph
lebas
speak
of
legal
proceedings
augustine
thanked
them
and
returned
home
even
more
undecided
than
she
had
been
before
consulting
them
she
now
ventured
to
go
to
the
house
in
the
rue
du
colombier
intending
to
confide
her
troubles
to
her
father
and
mother
for
she
was
like
a
sick
man
who
in
his
desperate
plight
tries
every
prescription
and
even
puts
faith
in
old
wives
remedies
the
old
people
received
their
daughter
with
an
effusiveness
that
touched
her
deeply
her
visit
brought
them
some
little
change
and
that
to
them
was
worth
a
fortune
for
the
last
four
years
they
had
gone
their
way
like
navigators
without
a
goal
or
a
compass
sitting
by
the
chimney
corner
they
would
talk
over
their
disasters
under
the
old
law
of
of
their
great
investments
in
cloth
of
the
way
they
had
weathered
bankruptcies
and
above
all
the
famous
failure
of
lecocq
monsieur
guillaume
s
battle
of
marengo
then
when
they
had
exhausted
the
tale
of
lawsuits
they
recapitulated
the
sum
total
of
their
most
profitable
and
told
each
other
old
stories
of
the
quarter
at
two
o
clock
old
guillaume
went
to
cast
an
eye
on
the
business
at
the
cat
and
racket
on
his
way
back
he
called
at
all
the
shops
formerly
the
rivals
of
his
own
where
the
young
proprietors
hoped
to
inveigle
the
old
draper
into
some
risky
discount
which
as
was
his
wont
he
never
refused
two
good
normandy
horses
were
dying
of
their
own
fat
in
the
stables
of
the
big
house
madame
guillaume
never
used
them
but
to
drag
her
on
sundays
to
high
mass
at
the
parish
church
three
times
a
week
the
worthy
couple
kept
open
house
by
the
influence
of
his
sommervieux
monsieur
guillaume
had
been
named
a
member
of
the
consulting
board
for
the
clothing
of
the
army
since
her
husband
had
stood
so
high
in
office

had
decided
that
she
must
receive
her
rooms
were
so
crammed
with
gold
and
silver
ornaments
and
furniture
tasteless
but
of
undoubted
value
that
the
simplest
room
in
the
house
looked
like
a
chapel
economy
and
expense
seemed
to
be
struggling
for
the
upper
hand
in
every
accessory
it
was
as
though
monsieur
guillaume
had
looked
to
a
good
investment
even
in
the
purchase
of
a
candlestick
in
the
midst
of
this
bazaar
where
splendor
revealed
the
owner
s
want
of
occupation
sommervieux
s
famous
picture
filled
the
place
of
honor
and
in
it
monsieur
and
madame
guillaume
found
their
chief
consolation
turning
their
eyes
harnessed
with
twenty
times
a
day
on
this
presentment
of
their
past
life
to
them
so
active
and
amusing
the
appearance
of
this
mansion
and
these
rooms
where
everything
had
an
aroma
of
staleness
and
mediocrity
the
spectacle
offered
by
these
two
beings
cast
away
as
it
were
on
a
rock
far
from
the
world
and
the
ideas
which
are
life
startled
augustine
she
could
here
contemplate
the
sequel
of
the
scene
of
which
the
first
part
had
struck
her
at
the
house
of
lebas
a
life
of
stir
without
movement
a
mechanical
and
instinctive
existence
like
that
of
the
beaver
and
then
she
felt
an
indefinable
pride
in
her
troubles
as
she
reflected
that
they
had
their
source
in
eighteen
months
of
such
happiness
as
in
her
eyes
was
worth
a
thousand
lives
like
this
its
vacuity
seemed
to
her
horrible
however
she
concealed
this
not
very
charitable
feeling
and
displayed
for
her
parents
her
accomplishments
of
mind
and
the
ingratiating
tenderness
that
love
had
revealed
to
her
disposing
them
to
listen
to
her
matrimonial
grievances
old
people
have
a
weakness
for
this
kind
of
confidence
madame
guillaume
wanted
to
know
the
most
trivial
details
of
that
alien
life
which
to
her
seemed
almost
fabulous
the
travels
of
baron
da
la
houtan
which
she
began
again
and
again
and
never
finished
told
her
nothing
more
concerning
the
canadian
savages
what
child
your
husband
shuts
himself
into
a
room
with
naked
women
and
you
are
so
simple
as
to
believe
that
he
draws
them
as
she
uttered
this
exclamation
the
grandmother
laid
her
spectacles
on
a
little
shook
her
skirts
and
clasped
her
hands
on
her
knees
raised
by
a
her
favorite
pedestal
but
mother
all
artists
are
obliged
to
have
he
took
good
care
not
to
tell
us
that
when
he
asked
leave
to
marry
you
if
i
had
known
it
i
would
never
had
given
my
daughter
to
a
man
who
followed
such
a
trade
religion
forbids
such
horrors
they
are
immoral
and
at
what
time
of
night
do
you
say
he
comes
home
at
one
o
clock
two
the
old
folks
looked
at
each
other
in
utter
amazement
then
he
gambles
said
monsieur
guillaume
in
my
day
only
gamblers
stayed
out
so
augustine
made
a
face
that
scorned
the
accusation
he
must
keep
you
up
through
dreadful
nights
waiting
for
him
said
madame
guillaume
but
you
go
to
bed
don
t
you
and
when
he
has
lost
the
wretch
wakes
no
mamma
on
the
contrary
he
is
sometimes
in
very
good
spirits
not
unfrequently
indeed
when
it
is
fine
he
suggests
that
i
should
get
up
and
go
into
the
the
woods
at
that
hour
then
have
you
such
a
small
set
of
rooms
that
his
bedroom
and
his
are
not
enough
and
that
he
must
run
about
but
it
is
just
to
give
you
cold
that
the
wretch
proposes
such
expeditions
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
you
did
one
ever
hear
of
a
man
settled
in
life
a
quiet
man
galloping
about
like
a
warlock
but
my
dear
mother
you
do
not
understand
that
he
must
have
excitement
to
fire
his
genius
he
is
fond
of
scenes
which
i
would
make
scenes
for
him
fine
scenes
cried
madame
guillaume
interrupting
her
daughter
how
can
you
show
any
consideration
to
such
a
man
in
the
first
place
i
don
t
like
his
drinking
water
only
it
is
not
wholesome
why
does
he
object
to
see
a
woman
eating
what
queer
notion
is
that
but
he
is
mad
all
you
tell
us
about
him
is
impossible
a
man
can
not
leave
his
home
without
a
word
and
never
come
back
for
ten
days
and
then
he
tells
you
he
has
been
to
dieppe
to
paint
the
sea
as
if
any
one
painted
the
sea
he
crams
you
with
a
pack
of
tales
that
are
too
augustine
opened
her
lips
to
defend
her
husband
but
madame
guillaume
enjoined
silence
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
which
she
obeyed
by
a
survival
of
habit
and
her
mother
went
on
in
harsh
tones
don
t
talk
to
me
about
the
man
he
never
set
foot
in
church
excepting
to
see
you
and
to
be
married
people
without
religion
are
capable
of
anything
did
guillaume
ever
dream
of
hiding
anything
from
me
of
spending
three
days
without
saying
a
word
to
me
and
of
chattering
afterwards
like
a
blind
magpie
my
dear
mother
you
judge
superior
people
too
severely
if
their
ideas
were
the
same
as
other
folks
they
would
not
be
men
of
very
well
then
let
men
of
genius
stop
at
home
and
not
get
married
what
a
man
of
genius
is
to
make
his
wife
miserable
and
because
he
is
a
genius
it
is
all
right
genius
genius
it
is
not
so
very
clever
to
say
black
one
minute
and
white
the
next
as
he
does
to
interrupt
other
people
to
dance
such
rigs
at
home
never
to
let
you
know
which
foot
you
are
to
stand
on
to
compel
his
wife
never
to
be
amused
unless
my
lord
is
in
gay
spirits
and
to
be
dull
when
he
is
but
mother
the
very
nature
of
such
imaginations
what
are
such
imaginations
madame
guillaume
went
on
interrupting
her
daughter
again
fine
ones
his
are
my
word
what
possesses
a
man
that
all
on
a
sudden
without
consulting
a
doctor
he
takes
it
into
his
head
to
eat
nothing
but
vegetables
if
indeed
it
were
from
religious
motives
it
might
do
him
some
good
but
he
has
no
more
religion
than
a
huguenot
was
there
ever
a
man
known
who
like
him
loved
horses
better
than
his
had
his
hair
curled
like
a
heathen
laid
statues
under
muslin
coverlets
shut
his
shutters
in
broad
day
to
work
by
there
get
along
if
he
were
not
so
grossly
immoral
he
would
be
fit
to
shut
up
in
a
lunatic
asylum
consult
monsieur
loraux
the
priest
at
saint
sulpice
ask
his
opinion
about
it
all
and
he
will
tell
you
that
your
husband
does
not
behave
like
a
oh
mother
can
you
believe
yes
i
do
believe
you
loved
him
and
you
can
see
none
of
these
things
but
i
can
remember
in
the
early
days
after
your
marriage
i
met
him
in
the
he
was
on
horseback
well
at
one
minute
he
was
galloping
as
hard
as
he
could
tear
and
then
pulled
up
to
a
walk
i
said
to
myself
at
that
moment
there
is
a
man
devoid
of
ah
ha
cried
monsieur
guillaume
how
wise
i
was
to
have
your
money
settled
on
yourself
with
such
a
queer
fellow
for
a
husband
when
augustine
was
so
imprudent
as
to
set
forth
her
serious
grievances
against
her
husband
the
two
old
people
were
speechless
with
indignation
but
the
word
divorce
was
ere
long
spoken
by
madame
guillaume
at
the
sound
of
the
word
divorce
the
apathetic
old
draper
seemed
to
wake
up
prompted
by
his
love
for
his
daughter
and
also
by
the
excitement
which
the
proceedings
would
bring
into
his
uneventful
life
father
guillaume
took
up
the
matter
he
made
himself
the
leader
of
the
application
for
a
divorce
laid
down
the
lines
of
it
almost
argued
the
case
he
offered
to
be
at
all
the
charges
to
see
the
lawyers
the
pleaders
the
judges
to
move
heaven
and
earth
madame
de
sommervieux
was
frightened
she
refused
her
father
s
services
said
she
would
not
be
separated
from
her
husband
even
if
she
were
ten
times
as
unhappy
and
talked
no
more
about
her
sorrows
after
being
overwhelmed
by
her
parents
with
all
the
little
wordless
and
consoling
kindnesses
by
which
the
old
couple
tried
in
vain
to
make
up
to
her
for
her
distress
of
heart
augustine
went
away
feeling
the
impossibility
of
making
a
superior
mind
intelligible
to
weak
intellects
she
had
learned
that
a
wife
must
hide
from
every
one
even
from
her
parents
woes
for
which
it
is
so
difficult
to
find
sympathy
the
storms
and
sufferings
of
the
upper
spheres
are
appreciated
only
by
the
lofty
spirits
who
inhabit
there
in
any
circumstance
we
can
only
be
judged
by
our
equals
thus
poor
augustine
found
herself
thrown
back
on
the
horror
of
her
meditations
in
the
cold
atmosphere
of
her
home
study
was
indifferent
to
her
since
study
had
not
brought
her
back
her
husband
s
heart
initiated
into
the
secret
of
these
souls
of
fire
but
bereft
of
their
resources
she
was
compelled
to
share
their
sorrows
without
sharing
their
pleasures
she
was
disgusted
with
the
world
which
to
her
seemed
mean
and
small
as
compared
with
the
incidents
of
passion
in
short
her
life
was
a
failure
one
evening
an
idea
flashed
upon
her
that
lighted
up
her
dark
grief
like
a
beam
from
heaven
such
an
idea
could
never
have
smiled
on
a
heart
less
pure
less
virtuous
than
hers
she
determined
to
go
to
the
duchesse
de
carigliano
not
to
ask
her
to
give
her
back
her
husband
s
heart
but
to
learn
the
arts
by
which
it
had
been
captured
to
engage
the
interest
of
this
haughty
fine
lady
for
the
mother
of
her
lover
s
children
to
appeal
to
her
and
make
her
the
instrument
of
her
future
happiness
since
she
was
the
cause
of
her
present
wretchedness
so
one
day
augustine
timid
as
she
was
but
armed
with
supernatural
courage
got
into
her
carriage
at
two
in
the
afternoon
to
try
for
admittance
to
the
boudoir
of
the
famous
coquette
who
was
never
visible
till
that
hour
madame
de
sommervieux
had
not
yet
seen
any
of
the
ancient
and
magnificent
mansions
of
the
faubourg
as
she
made
her
way
through
the
stately
corridors
the
handsome
staircases
the
vast
full
of
flowers
though
it
was
in
the
depth
of
winter
and
decorated
with
the
taste
peculiar
to
women
born
to
opulence
or
to
the
elegant
habits
of
the
aristocracy
augustine
felt
a
terrible
clutch
at
her
heart
she
coveted
the
secrets
of
an
elegance
of
which
she
had
never
had
an
idea
she
breathed
in
an
air
of
grandeur
which
explained
the
attraction
of
the
house
for
her
husband
when
she
reached
the
private
rooms
of
the
duchess
she
was
filled
with
jealousy
and
a
sort
of
despair
as
she
admired
the
luxurious
arrangement
of
the
furniture
the
draperies
and
the
hangings
here
disorder
was
a
grace
here
luxury
affected
a
certain
contempt
of
splendor
the
fragrance
that
floated
in
the
warm
air
flattered
the
sense
of
smell
without
offending
it
the
accessories
of
the
rooms
were
in
harmony
with
a
view
through
windows
of
the
lawns
in
a
garden
planted
with
evergreen
trees
it
was
all
bewitching
and
the
art
of
it
was
not
perceptible
the
whole
spirit
of
the
mistress
of
these
rooms
pervaded
the
where
augustine
awaited
her
she
tried
to
divine
her
rival
s
character
from
the
aspect
of
the
scattered
objects
but
there
was
here
something
as
impenetrable
in
the
disorder
as
in
the
symmetry
and
to
the
young
wife
all
was
a
sealed
letter
all
that
she
could
discern
was
that
as
a
woman
the
duchess
was
a
superior
person
then
a
painful
thought
came
over
her
alas
and
is
it
true
she
wondered
that
a
simple
and
loving
heart
is
not
to
an
artist
that
to
balance
the
weight
of
these
powerful
souls
they
need
a
union
with
feminine
souls
of
a
strength
equal
to
their
own
if
i
had
been
brought
up
like
this
siren
our
weapons
at
least
might
have
been
equal
in
the
hour
of
but
i
am
not
at
home
the
sharp
harsh
words
though
spoken
in
an
undertone
in
the
adjoining
boudoir
were
heard
by
augustine
and
her
heart
beat
violently
the
lady
is
in
there
replied
the
maid
you
are
an
idiot
show
her
in
replied
the
duchess
whose
voice
was
sweeter
and
had
assumed
the
dulcet
tones
of
politeness
she
evidently
now
meant
to
be
heard
augustine
shyly
entered
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
dainty
boudoir
she
saw
the
duchess
lounging
luxuriously
on
an
ottoman
covered
with
brown
velvet
and
placed
in
the
centre
of
a
sort
of
apse
outlined
by
soft
folds
of
white
muslin
over
a
yellow
lining
ornaments
of
gilt
bronze
arranged
with
exquisite
taste
enhanced
this
sort
of
dais
under
which
the
duchess
reclined
like
a
greek
statue
the
dark
hue
of
the
velvet
gave
relief
to
every
fascinating
charm
a
subdued
light
friendly
to
her
beauty
fell
like
a
reflection
rather
than
a
direct
illumination
a
few
rare
flowers
raised
their
perfumed
heads
from
costly
sevres
vases
at
the
moment
when
this
picture
was
presented
to
augustine
s
astonished
eyes
she
was
approaching
so
noiselessly
that
she
caught
a
glance
from
those
of
the
enchantress
this
look
seemed
to
say
to
some
one
whom
augustine
did
not
at
first
perceive
stay
you
will
see
a
pretty
woman
and
make
her
visit
seem
less
of
a
on
seeing
augustine
the
duchess
rose
and
made
her
sit
down
by
her
and
to
what
do
i
owe
the
pleasure
of
this
visit
madame
she
said
with
a
most
gracious
smile
why
all
the
falseness
thought
augustine
replying
only
with
a
bow
her
silence
was
compulsory
the
young
woman
saw
before
her
a
superfluous
witness
of
the
scene
this
personage
was
of
all
the
colonels
in
the
army
the
youngest
the
most
fashionable
and
the
finest
man
his
face
full
of
life
and
youth
but
already
expressive
was
further
enhanced
by
a
small
moustache
twirled
up
into
points
and
as
black
as
jet
by
a
full
imperial
by
whiskers
carefully
combed
and
a
forest
of
black
hair
in
some
disorder
he
was
whisking
a
riding
whip
with
an
air
of
ease
and
freedom
which
suited
his
expression
and
the
elegance
of
his
dress
the
ribbons
attached
to
his
were
carelessly
tied
and
he
seemed
to
pride
himself
much
more
on
his
smart
appearance
than
on
his
courage
augustine
looked
at
the
duchesse
de
carigliano
and
indicated
the
colonel
by
a
sidelong
glance
all
its
mute
appeal
was
understood
then
monsieur
d
aiglemont
we
shall
meet
in
the
bois
de
these
words
were
spoken
by
the
siren
as
though
they
were
the
result
of
an
agreement
made
before
augustine
s
arrival
and
she
winged
them
with
a
threatening
look
that
the
officer
deserved
perhaps
for
the
admiration
he
showed
in
gazing
at
the
modest
flower
which
contrasted
so
well
with
the
haughty
duchess
the
young
fop
bowed
in
silence
turned
on
the
heels
of
his
boots
and
gracefully
quitted
the
boudoir
at
this
instant
augustine
watching
her
rival
whose
eyes
seemed
to
follow
the
brilliant
officer
detected
in
that
glance
a
sentiment
of
which
the
transient
expression
is
known
to
every
woman
she
perceived
with
the
deepest
anguish
that
her
visit
would
be
useless
this
lady
full
of
artifice
was
too
greedy
of
homage
not
to
have
a
ruthless
heart
madame
said
augustine
in
a
broken
voice
the
step
i
am
about
to
take
will
seem
to
you
very
strange
but
there
is
a
madness
of
despair
which
ought
to
excuse
anything
i
understand
only
too
well
why
theodore
prefers
your
house
to
any
other
and
why
your
mind
has
so
much
power
over
his
alas
i
have
only
to
look
into
myself
to
find
more
than
ample
reasons
but
i
am
devoted
to
my
husband
madame
two
years
of
tears
have
not
effaced
his
image
from
my
heart
though
i
have
lost
his
in
my
folly
i
dared
to
dream
of
a
contest
with
you
and
i
have
come
to
you
to
ask
you
by
what
means
i
may
triumph
over
yourself
oh
madame
cried
the
young
wife
ardently
seizing
the
hand
which
her
rival
allowed
her
to
hold
i
will
never
pray
to
god
for
my
own
happiness
with
so
much
fervor
as
i
will
beseech
him
for
yours
if
you
will
help
me
to
win
back
sommervieux
s
regard
i
will
not
say
his
love
i
have
no
hope
but
in
you
ah
tell
me
how
you
could
please
him
and
make
him
forget
the
first
days
at
these
words
augustine
broke
down
suffocated
with
sobs
she
could
not
suppress
ashamed
of
her
weakness
she
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
which
she
bathed
with
tears
what
a
child
you
are
my
dear
little
beauty
said
the
duchess
carried
away
by
the
novelty
of
such
a
scene
and
touched
in
spite
of
herself
at
receiving
such
homage
from
the
most
perfect
virtue
perhaps
in
paris
she
took
the
young
wife
s
handkerchief
and
herself
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
soothing
her
by
a
few
monosyllables
murmured
with
gracious
compassion
after
a
moment
s
silence
the
duchess
grasping
poor
augustine
s
hands
in
both
her
own
hands
that
had
a
rare
character
of
dignity
and
powerful
beauty
said
in
a
gentle
and
friendly
voice
my
first
warning
is
to
advise
you
not
to
weep
so
bitterly
tears
are
disfiguring
we
must
learn
to
deal
firmly
with
the
sorrows
that
make
us
ill
for
love
does
not
linger
long
by
a
melancholy
at
first
no
doubt
lends
a
certain
attractive
grace
but
it
ends
by
dragging
the
features
and
blighting
the
loveliest
face
and
besides
our
tyrants
are
so
vain
as
to
insist
that
their
slaves
should
be
always
but
madame
it
is
not
in
my
power
not
to
feel
how
is
it
possible
without
suffering
a
thousand
deaths
to
see
the
face
which
once
beamed
with
love
and
gladness
turn
chill
colorless
and
indifferent
i
can
not
control
my
heart
so
much
the
worse
sweet
child
but
i
fancy
i
know
all
your
story
in
the
first
place
if
your
husband
is
unfaithful
to
you
understand
clearly
that
i
am
not
his
accomplice
if
i
was
anxious
to
have
him
in
my
it
was
i
own
out
of
vanity
he
was
famous
and
he
went
nowhere
i
like
you
too
much
already
to
tell
you
all
the
mad
things
he
has
done
for
my
sake
i
will
only
reveal
one
because
it
may
perhaps
help
us
to
bring
him
back
to
you
and
to
punish
him
for
the
audacity
of
his
behavior
to
me
he
will
end
by
compromising
me
i
know
the
world
too
well
my
dear
to
abandon
myself
to
the
discretion
of
a
too
superior
man
you
should
know
that
one
may
allow
them
to
court
one
but
marry
them
that
is
a
mistake
we
women
ought
to
admire
men
of
genius
and
delight
in
them
as
a
spectacle
but
as
to
living
with
them
no
no
it
is
like
wanting
to
find
pleasure
in
inspecting
the
machinery
of
the
opera
instead
of
sitting
in
a
box
to
enjoy
its
brilliant
illusions
but
this
misfortune
has
fallen
on
you
my
poor
child
has
it
not
well
then
you
must
try
to
arm
yourself
against
ah
madame
before
coming
in
here
only
seeing
you
as
i
came
in
i
already
detected
some
arts
of
which
i
had
no
well
come
and
see
me
sometimes
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
have
mastered
the
knowledge
of
these
trifles
important
too
in
their
way
outward
things
are
to
fools
half
of
life
and
in
that
matter
more
than
one
clever
man
is
a
fool
in
spite
of
all
his
talent
but
i
dare
wager
you
never
could
refuse
your
theodore
anything
how
refuse
anything
madame
if
one
loves
a
man
poor
innocent
i
could
adore
you
for
your
simplicity
you
should
know
that
the
more
we
love
the
less
we
should
allow
a
man
above
all
a
husband
to
see
the
whole
extent
of
our
passion
the
one
who
loves
most
is
tyrannized
over
and
which
is
worse
is
sooner
or
later
neglected
the
one
who
wishes
to
rule
should
what
madame
must
i
then
dissimulate
calculate
become
false
form
an
artificial
character
and
live
in
it
how
is
it
possible
to
live
in
such
a
way
can
you
she
hesitated
the
duchess
smiled
my
dear
child
the
great
lady
went
on
in
a
serious
tone
conjugal
happiness
has
in
all
times
been
a
speculation
a
business
demanding
particular
attention
if
you
persist
in
talking
passion
while
i
am
talking
marriage
we
shall
soon
cease
to
understand
each
other
listen
to
me
she
went
on
assuming
a
confidential
tone
i
have
been
in
the
way
of
seeing
some
of
the
superior
men
of
our
day
those
who
have
married
have
for
the
most
part
chosen
quite
insignificant
wives
well
those
wives
governed
them
as
the
emperor
governs
us
and
if
they
were
not
loved
they
were
at
least
respected
i
like
secrets
especially
those
which
concern
women
well
enough
to
have
amused
myself
by
seeking
the
clue
to
the
riddle
well
my
sweet
child
those
worthy
women
had
the
gift
of
analyzing
their
husbands
nature
instead
of
taking
fright
like
you
at
their
superiority
they
very
acutely
noted
the
qualities
they
lacked
and
either
by
possessing
those
qualities
or
by
feigning
to
possess
them
they
found
means
of
making
such
a
handsome
display
of
them
in
their
husbands
eyes
that
in
the
end
they
impressed
them
also
i
must
tell
you
all
these
souls
which
appear
so
lofty
have
just
a
speck
of
madness
in
them
which
we
ought
to
know
how
to
take
advantage
of
by
firmly
resolving
to
have
the
upper
hand
and
never
deviating
from
that
aim
by
bringing
all
our
actions
to
bear
on
it
all
our
ideas
our
cajolery
we
subjugate
these
eminently
capricious
natures
which
by
the
very
mutability
of
their
thoughts
lend
us
the
means
of
influencing
good
heavens
cried
the
young
wife
in
dismay
and
this
is
life
it
is
a
warfare
in
which
we
must
always
threaten
said
the
duchess
laughing
our
power
is
wholly
factitious
and
we
must
never
allow
a
man
to
despise
us
it
is
impossible
to
recover
from
such
a
descent
but
by
odious
manoeuvring
come
she
added
i
will
give
you
a
means
of
bringing
your
husband
to
his
she
rose
with
a
smile
to
guide
the
young
and
guileless
apprentice
to
conjugal
arts
through
the
labyrinth
of
her
palace
they
came
to
a
which
led
up
to
the
reception
rooms
as
madame
de
carigliano
pressed
the
secret
springlock
of
the
door
she
stopped
looking
at
augustine
with
an
inimitable
gleam
of
shrewdness
and
grace
the
duc
de
carigliano
adores
me
said
she
well
he
dare
not
enter
by
this
door
without
my
leave
and
he
is
a
man
in
the
habit
of
commanding
thousands
of
soldiers
he
knows
how
to
face
a
battery
but
before
me
he
is
afraid
augustine
sighed
they
entered
a
sumptuous
gallery
where
the
painter
s
wife
was
led
by
the
duchess
up
to
the
portrait
painted
by
theodore
of
mademoiselle
guillaume
on
seeing
it
augustine
uttered
a
cry
i
knew
it
was
no
longer
in
my
house
she
said
but
here
my
dear
child
i
asked
for
it
merely
to
see
what
pitch
of
idiocy
a
man
of
genius
may
attain
to
sooner
or
later
i
should
have
returned
it
to
you
for
i
never
expected
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
original
here
face
to
face
with
the
copy
while
we
finish
our
conversation
i
will
have
it
carried
down
to
your
carriage
and
if
armed
with
such
a
talisman
you
are
not
your
husband
s
mistress
for
a
hundred
years
you
are
not
a
woman
and
you
deserve
your
augustine
kissed
the
duchess
hand
and
the
lady
clasped
her
to
her
heart
with
all
the
more
tenderness
because
she
would
forget
her
by
the
morrow
this
scene
might
perhaps
have
destroyed
for
ever
the
candor
and
purity
of
a
less
virtuous
woman
than
augustine
for
the
astute
politics
of
the
higher
social
spheres
were
no
more
consonant
to
augustine
than
the
narrow
reasoning
of
joseph
lebas
or
madame
guillaume
s
vapid
morality
strange
are
the
results
of
the
false
positions
into
which
we
may
be
brought
by
the
slightest
mistake
in
the
conduct
of
life
augustine
was
like
an
alpine
cowherd
surprised
by
an
avalanche
if
he
hesitates
if
he
listens
to
the
shouts
of
his
comrades
he
is
almost
certainly
lost
in
such
a
crisis
the
heart
steels
itself
or
breaks
madame
de
sommervieux
returned
home
a
prey
to
such
agitation
as
it
is
difficult
to
describe
her
conversation
with
the
duchesse
de
carigliano
had
roused
in
her
mind
a
crowd
of
contradictory
thoughts
like
the
sheep
in
the
fable
full
of
courage
in
the
wolf
s
absence
she
preached
to
herself
and
laid
down
admirable
plans
of
conduct
she
devised
a
thousand
coquettish
stratagems
she
even
talked
to
her
husband
finding
away
from
him
all
the
springs
of
true
eloquence
which
never
desert
a
woman
then
as
she
pictured
to
herself
theodore
s
clear
and
steadfast
gaze
she
began
to
quake
when
she
asked
whether
monsieur
were
at
home
her
voice
shook
on
learning
that
he
would
not
be
in
to
dinner
she
felt
an
unaccountable
thrill
of
joy
like
a
criminal
who
has
appealed
against
sentence
of
death
a
respite
however
short
seemed
to
her
a
lifetime
she
placed
the
portrait
in
her
room
and
waited
for
her
husband
in
all
the
agonies
of
hope
that
this
venture
must
decide
her
future
life
she
felt
too
keenly
not
to
shiver
at
every
sound
even
the
low
ticking
of
the
clock
which
seemed
to
aggravate
her
terrors
by
doling
them
out
to
her
she
tried
to
cheat
time
by
various
devices
the
idea
struck
her
of
dressing
in
a
way
which
would
make
her
exactly
like
the
portrait
then
knowing
her
husband
s
restless
temper
she
had
her
room
lighted
up
with
unusual
brightness
feeling
sure
that
when
he
came
in
curiosity
would
bring
him
there
at
once
midnight
had
struck
when
at
the
call
of
the
groom
the
street
gate
was
opened
and
the
artist
s
carriage
rumbled
in
over
the
stones
of
the
silent
courtyard
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
illumination
asked
theodore
in
glad
tones
as
he
came
into
her
room
augustine
skilfully
seized
the
auspicious
moment
she
threw
herself
into
her
husband
s
arms
and
pointed
to
the
portrait
the
artist
stood
rigid
as
a
rock
and
his
eyes
turned
alternately
on
augustine
on
the
accusing
dress
the
frightened
wife
as
she
watched
her
husband
s
changeful
brow
that
terrible
brow
saw
the
expressive
furrows
gathering
like
clouds
then
she
felt
her
blood
curdling
in
her
veins
when
with
a
glaring
look
and
in
a
deep
hollow
voice
he
began
to
question
her
where
did
you
find
that
picture
the
duchess
de
carigliano
returned
it
to
you
asked
her
for
it
i
did
not
know
that
she
had
the
gentleness
or
rather
the
exquisite
sweetness
of
this
angel
s
voice
might
have
touched
a
cannibal
but
not
an
artist
in
the
clutches
of
wounded
vanity
it
is
worthy
of
her
exclaimed
the
painter
in
a
voice
of
thunder
i
will
be
avenged
he
cried
striding
up
and
down
the
room
she
shall
die
of
shame
i
will
paint
her
yes
i
will
paint
her
as
messalina
stealing
out
at
night
from
the
palace
of
theodore
said
a
faint
voice
i
will
kill
her
my
dear
she
is
in
love
with
that
little
cavalry
colonel
because
he
rides
well
theodore
let
me
be
said
the
painter
in
a
tone
almost
like
a
roar
it
would
be
odious
to
describe
the
whole
scene
in
the
end
the
frenzy
of
passion
prompted
the
artist
to
acts
and
words
which
any
woman
not
so
young
as
augustine
would
have
ascribed
to
madness
at
eight
o
clock
next
morning
madame
guillaume
surprising
her
daughter
found
her
pale
with
red
eyes
her
hair
in
disorder
holding
a
handkerchief
soaked
with
tears
while
she
gazed
at
the
floor
strewn
with
the
torn
fragments
of
a
dress
and
the
broken
fragments
of
a
large
gilt
augustine
almost
senseless
with
grief
pointed
to
the
wreck
with
a
gesture
of
deep
despair
i
don
t
know
that
the
loss
is
very
great
cried
the
old
mistress
of
the
cat
and
racket
it
was
like
you
no
doubt
but
i
am
told
that
there
is
a
man
on
the
boulevard
who
paints
lovely
portraits
for
fifty
oh
mother
poor
child
you
are
quite
right
replied
madame
guillaume
who
misinterpreted
the
expression
of
her
daughter
s
glance
at
her
true
my
child
no
one
ever
can
love
you
as
fondly
as
a
mother
my
darling
i
guess
it
all
but
confide
your
sorrows
to
me
and
i
will
comfort
you
did
i
not
tell
you
long
ago
that
the
man
was
mad
your
maid
has
told
me
pretty
stories
why
he
must
be
a
perfect
monster
augustine
laid
a
finger
on
her
white
lips
as
if
to
implore
a
moment
s
silence
during
this
dreadful
night
misery
had
led
her
to
that
patient
resignation
which
in
mothers
and
loving
wives
transcends
in
its
effects
all
human
energy
and
perhaps
reveals
in
the
heart
of
women
the
existence
of
certain
chords
which
god
has
withheld
from
men
an
inscription
engraved
on
a
broken
column
in
the
cemetery
at
montmartre
states
that
madame
de
sommervieux

at
the
age

scene
of

tragedy

the
solemn
day
of
the
dead
he
never
passes
this
youthful
monument
without
wondering
whether
it
does
not
need
a
stronger
woman
than
augustine
to
endure
the
violent
embrace
of
genius

humble
and
modest
flowers
