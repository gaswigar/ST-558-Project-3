chapter
i
a
view
of
stockholm
it
was
an
evening
in
the
beginning
of
may
the
little
garden
on
moses
height
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
had
not
yet
been
thrown
open
to
the
public
and
the
were
still
unturned
the
snowdrops
had
worked
through
the
accumulations
of
last
year
dead
leaves
and
were
on
the
point
of
closing
their
short
career
and
making
room
for
the
crocuses
which
had
found
shelter
under
a
barren
pear
tree
the
elder
was
waiting
for
a
southerly
wind
before
bursting
into
bloom
but
the
tightly
closed
buds
of
the
limes
still
offered
cover
for
to
the
chaffinches
busily
employed
in
building
their
nests
between
trunk
and
branch
no
human
foot
had
trod
the
gravel
paths
since
last
winter
snow
had
melted
and
the
free
and
easy
life
of
beasts
and
flowers
was
left
undisturbed
the
sparrows
industriously
collected
all
manner
of
rubbish
and
stowed
it
away
under
the
tiles
of
the
navigation
school
they
burdened
themselves
with
scraps
of
the
of
last
autumn
fireworks
and
picked
the
straw
covers
off
the
young
trees
transplanted
from
the
nursery
in
the
deer
park
only
a
year
ago
nothing
escaped
them
they
discovered
shreds
of
muslin
in
the
summer
arbours
the
splintered
leg
of
a
seat
supplied
them
with
tufts
of
hair
left
on
the
battlefield
by
dogs
which
had
not
been
fighting
there
since
josephine
day
what
a
life
it
was
the
sun
was
standing
over
the
liljeholm
throwing
sheaves
of
rays
towards
the
east
they
pierced
the
columns
of
smoke
of
bergsund
flashed
across
the
riddarfjörd
climbed
to
the
cross
of
the
riddarholms
church
flung
themselves
on
to
the
steep
roof
of
the
german
church
opposite
toyed
with
the
bunting
displayed
by
the
boats
on
the
pontoon
bridge
sparkled
in
the
windows
of
the
chief
illuminated
the
woods
of
the
liding
island
and
died
away
in
a
rosy
cloud
far
far
away
in
the
distance
where
the
sea
was
and
from
thence
the
wind
came
and
travelled
back
by
the
same
way
over
vaxholm
past
the
fortress
past
the
and
along
the
sikla
island
forcing
its
way
in
behind
the
hästarholm
glancing
at
the
summer
resorts
then
out
again
and
on
on
to
the
hospital
daniken
there
it
took
fright
and
dashed
away
in
a
headlong
career
along
the
southern
shore
noticed
the
smell
of
coal
tar
and
came
dead
against
the
city
quay
rushed
up
to
moses
height
swept
into
the
garden
and
buffeted
against
a
wall
the
wall
was
opened
by
a
who
at
the
very
moment
was
engaged
in
peeling
off
the
paper
pasted
over
the
chinks
of
the
double
windows
a
terrible
smell
of
dripping
beer
dregs
pine
needles
and
sawdust
poured
out
and
was
carried
away
by
the
wind
while
the
maid
stood
breathing
the
fresh
air
through
her
nostrils
it
plucked
the
strewn
with
barberry
berries
tinsel
and
rose
leaves
from
the
space
between
the
windows
and
danced
it
along
the
paths
joined
by
sparrows
and
chaffinches
who
saw
here
the
solution
of
the
greater
part
of
their
housing
problem
meanwhile
the
maid
continued
her
work
at
the
double
windows
in
a
few
minutes
the
door
leading
from
the
restaurant
stood
open
and
a
man
well
but
plainly
dressed
stepped
out
into
the
garden
there
was
nothing
striking
about
his
face
beyond
a
slight
expression
of
care
and
worry
which
disappeared
as
soon
as
he
had
emerged
from
the
stuffy
room
and
caught
sight
of
the
wide
horizon
he
turned
to
the
side
from
whence
the
wind
came
opened
his
overcoat
and
repeatedly
drew
a
deep
breath
which
seemed
to
relieve
his
heart
and
lungs
then
he
began
to
stroll
up
and
down
the
barrier
which
separated
the
garden
from
the
cliffs
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
far
below
him
lay
the
noisy
reawakening
town
the
steam
cranes
whirred
in
the
harbour
the
iron
bars
rattled
in
the
iron
weighing
machine
the
whistles
of
the
shrilled
the
steamers
at
the
pontoon
bridge
smoked
the
omnibuses
rumbled
over
the
uneven
noise
and
uproar
in
the
fish
market
sails
and
flags
on
the
water
outside
the
screams
of
the
from
the
dockyard
the
turning
out
of
the
guard
the
clattering
of
the
wooden
shoes
of
the
all
this
produced
an
impression
of
life
and
bustle
which
seemed
to
rouse
the
young
man
energy
his
face
assumed
an
expression
of
defiance
cheerfulness
and
resolution
and
as
he
leaned
over
the
barrier
and
looked
at
the
town
below
he
seemed
to
be
watching
an
enemy
his
nostrils
expanded
his
eyes
flashed
and
he
raised
his
clenched
fist
as
if
he
were
challenging
or
threatening
the
poor
town
the
bells
of
catherine
chimed
seven
the
splenetic
treble
of
mary
seconded
the
basses
of
the
great
church
and
the
german
church
joined
in
and
soon
the
air
was
vibrating
with
the
sound
made
by
the
seven
bells
of
the
town
then
one
after
the
other
relapsed
into
silence
until
far
away
in
the
distance
only
the
last
one
of
them
could
be
heard
singing
its
peaceful
evensong
it
had
a
higher
note
a
purer
tone
and
a
quicker
tempo
than
the
others
yes
it
had
he
listened
and
wondered
whence
the
sound
came
for
it
seemed
to
stir
up
vague
memories
in
him
all
of
a
sudden
his
face
relaxed
and
his
features
expressed
the
misery
of
a
forsaken
child
and
he
was
forsaken
his
father
and
mother
were
lying
in
the
churchyard
of
clara
from
whence
the
bell
could
still
be
heard
and
he
was
a
child
he
still
believed
in
everything
truth
and
fairy
tales
alike
the
bell
of
clara
was
silent
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
gravel
path
roused
him
from
his
reverie
a
short
man
with
came
towards
him
from
the
verandah
he
wore
spectacles
apparently
more
for
the
sake
of
protecting
his
glances
than
his
eyes
and
his
malicious
mouth
was
generally
twisted
into
a
kindly
almost
benevolent
expression
he
was
dressed
in
a
neat
overcoat
with
defective
buttons
a
somewhat
battered
hat
and
trousers
hoisted
at
his
walk
indicated
assurance
as
well
as
timidity
his
whole
appearance
was
so
indefinite
that
it
was
impossible
to
guess
at
his
age
or
social
position
he
might
just
as
well
have
been
an
artisan
as
a
government
official
his
age
was
anything
between
and
years
he
was
obviously
flattered
to
find
himself
in
the
company
of
the
man
whom
he
had
come
to
meet
for
he
raised
his
bulging
hat
with
unusual
ceremony
and
smiled
his
kindliest
smile
i
hope
you
have
been
waiting
assessor
not
for
a
second
it
only
just
struck
seven
thank
you
for
coming
i
must
confess
that
this
meeting
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
me
i
might
almost
say
it
concerns
my
whole
future
mr
struve
bless
me
do
you
mean
it
struve
blinked
he
had
come
to
drink
a
glass
of
toddy
and
was
very
little
inclined
for
a
serious
conversation
he
had
his
reasons
for
that
we
shall
be
more
undisturbed
if
we
have
our
toddy
outside
if
you
do
mind
continued
the
assessor
struve
stroked
his
right
whisker
put
his
hat
carefully
on
his
head
and
thanked
the
assessor
for
his
invitation
but
he
looked
uneasy
to
begin
with
i
must
ask
you
to
drop
the
began
the
young
man
i
never
been
more
than
a
regular
assistant
and
i
cease
to
be
even
that
from
i
falk
nothing
else
what
struve
looked
as
if
he
had
lost
a
distinguished
friend
but
he
kept
his
temper
you
a
man
with
liberal
tendencies
struve
tried
to
explain
himself
but
falk
continued
i
asked
you
to
meet
me
here
in
your
character
of
contributor
to
the
liberal
good
heavens
i
such
a
very
unimportant
contributor
i
read
your
thundering
articles
on
the
working
man
question
and
all
other
questions
which
nearly
concern
us
we
in
the
year
three
in
roman
figures
for
it
is
now
the
third
year
of
the
new
parliament
and
soon
our
hopes
will
have
become
realities
i
read
your
excellent
biographies
of
our
leading
politicians
in
the
the
lives
of
those
men
of
the
people
who
have
at
last
been
allowed
to
voice
what
oppressed
them
for
so
long
you
a
man
of
progress
and
i
a
great
respect
for
you
struve
whose
eyes
had
grown
dull
instead
of
kindling
at
the
fervent
words
seized
with
pleasure
the
proffered
i
must
admit
he
said
eagerly
that
i
immensely
pleased
to
find
myself
appreciated
by
a
young
and
i
must
say
it
excellent
man
like
you
assessor
but
on
the
other
hand
why
talk
of
such
grave
not
to
say
sad
things
when
we
sitting
here
in
the
lap
of
nature
on
the
first
day
of
spring
while
all
the
buds
are
bursting
and
the
sun
is
pouring
his
warmth
on
the
whole
creation
let
snap
our
fingers
at
care
and
drink
our
glass
in
peace
excuse
me
i
believe
i
your
senior
and
i
venture
to
propose
therefore
falk
who
like
a
flint
had
gone
out
in
search
of
steel
realized
that
he
had
struck
wood
he
accepted
the
proposal
without
eagerness
and
the
new
brothers
sat
side
by
side
and
all
they
had
to
tell
each
other
was
the
disappointment
expressed
in
their
faces
i
mentioned
a
little
while
ago
falk
resumed
that
i
broken
with
my
past
life
and
thrown
up
my
career
as
a
government
employé
i
only
add
that
i
intend
taking
up
literature
literature
good
heavens
why
oh
but
that
a
pity
it
is
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how
to
set
about
finding
work
h
that
really
difficult
to
say
the
profession
is
crowded
with
so
many
people
of
all
sorts
but
you
must
think
of
it
it
really
is
a
pity
to
spoil
your
career
the
literary
profession
is
a
bad
one
struve
looked
sorry
but
he
could
not
hide
a
certain
satisfaction
at
having
met
a
friend
in
misfortune
but
tell
me
he
continued
why
are
you
throwing
up
a
career
which
promises
a
man
honours
as
well
as
influence
honours
to
those
who
have
usurped
the
power
and
influence
to
the
most
unscrupulous
stuff
it
is
really
as
bad
as
all
that
is
it
well
then
i
must
speak
more
plainly
i
show
you
the
inner
working
of
one
of
the
six
departments
for
which
i
had
put
down
the
first
five
i
left
at
once
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
there
was
no
room
for
me
whenever
i
went
and
asked
whether
there
was
anything
for
me
to
do
i
was
told
no
and
i
never
saw
anybody
doing
anything
and
that
was
in
the
busy
departments
like
the
committee
on
brandy
distilleries
the
direct
taxation
office
and
the
board
of
administration
of
employés
pensions
but
when
i
noticed
the
swarming
crowd
of
officials
the
idea
struck
me
that
the
department
which
had
to
pay
out
all
the
salaries
must
surely
be
very
busy
indeed
i
therefore
put
my
name
down
for
the
board
of
payment
of
employés
salaries
and
did
you
go
there
asked
struve
beginning
to
feel
interested
yes
i
shall
never
forget
the
great
impression
made
on
me
by
my
visit
to
this
thoroughly
department
i
went
there
at
eleven
one
morning
because
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
time
when
the
offices
open
in
the
i
found
two
young
messengers
sprawling
on
a
table
on
their
stomachs
reading
the
the
struve
who
had
up
to
the
present
been
feeding
the
sparrows
with
sugar
pricked
up
his
ears
yes
i
said
morning
a
feeble
wriggling
of
the
backs
indicated
that
they
accepted
my
good
morning
without
any
decided
displeasure
one
of
them
even
went
to
the
length
of
waggling
the
heel
of
his
right
foot
which
might
have
been
intended
as
a
substitute
for
a
handshake
i
asked
whether
either
of
the
gentlemen
were
disengaged
and
could
show
me
the
offices
both
of
them
declared
that
they
were
unable
to
do
so
because
their
orders
were
not
to
leave
the
i
inquired
whether
there
were
any
other
messengers
yes
there
were
others
but
the
chief
messenger
was
away
on
a
holiday
the
first
messenger
was
on
leave
the
second
was
not
on
duty
the
third
had
gone
to
the
post
the
fourth
was
ill
the
fifth
had
gone
to
fetch
some
drinking
water
the
sixth
was
in
the
yard
he
remained
all
day
long
moreover
no
official
ever
arrived
before
one
this
was
a
hint
to
me
that
my
early
inconvenient
visit
was
not
good
form
and
at
the
same
time
a
reminder
that
the
messengers
also
were
government
employés
but
when
i
stated
that
i
was
firmly
resolved
on
seeing
the
offices
so
as
to
gain
an
idea
of
the
division
of
labour
in
so
important
and
comprehensive
a
department
the
younger
of
the
two
consented
to
come
with
me
when
he
opened
the
door
i
had
a
magnificent
view
of
a
suite
of
sixteen
rooms
of
various
sizes
there
must
be
work
here
i
thought
congratulating
myself
on
my
happy
idea
of
coming
the
crackling
of
sixteen
birchwood
fires
in
sixteen
tiled
stoves
interrupted
in
the
pleasantest
manner
the
solitude
of
the
place
struve
who
had
become
more
and
more
interested
fumbled
for
a
pencil
between
the
material
and
lining
of
his
waistcoat
and
wrote
on
his
left
cuff
is
the
adjuncts
room
explained
the
messenger
see
are
there
many
adjuncts
in
this
department
i
asked
yes
more
than
enough
do
they
do
all
day
long
they
write
of
course
a
little
he
was
speaking
familiarly
so
that
i
thought
it
time
to
interrupt
him
after
wandering
through
the
copyists
the
notaries
the
clerk
the
controller
and
his
secretary
the
reviser
and
his
secretary
the
public
prosecutor
the
registrar
of
the
exchequer
the
master
of
the
rolls
and
the
librarian
the
treasurer
the
cashier
the
procurator
the
protonotary
the
keeper
of
the
minutes
the
actuary
the
keeper
of
the
records
the
secretary
the
first
clerk
and
the
head
of
the
department
rooms
we
came
to
a
door
which
bore
in
gilt
letters
the
words
president
i
was
going
to
open
the
door
but
the
messenger
stopped
me
genuinely
uneasy
he
seized
my
arm
and
whispered
he
asleep
i
asked
my
thoughts
busy
with
an
old
rumour
god
sake
be
quiet
no
one
may
enter
here
unless
the
president
rings
the
bell
he
often
ring
i
never
heard
him
ringing
in
my
time
and
i
been
here
twelve
months
he
was
again
inclined
to
be
familiar
so
i
said
no
more
about
noon
the
adjuncts
began
to
arrive
and
to
my
amazement
i
found
in
them
nothing
but
old
friends
from
the
committee
on
brandy
distilleries
and
the
board
of
administration
of
employés
pensions
my
amazement
grew
when
the
registrar
from
the
inland
revenue
office
strolled
into
the
actuary
room
and
made
himself
as
comfortable
in
his
as
he
used
to
do
in
the
inland
revenue
office
i
took
one
of
the
young
men
aside
and
asked
him
whether
it
would
not
be
advisable
for
me
to
call
on
the
president
was
his
mysterious
reply
while
he
took
me
into
room
no
again
this
mysterious
shsh
the
room
which
we
had
just
entered
was
quite
as
dark
as
the
rest
of
them
but
it
was
much
dirtier
the
horsehair
stuffing
was
bursting
through
the
leather
covering
of
the
furniture
thick
dust
lay
on
the
by
the
side
of
an
inkstand
in
which
the
ink
had
dried
long
ago
lay
an
unused
stick
of
with
the
former
name
marked
on
it
in
letters
in
addition
there
was
a
pair
of
paper
shears
whose
blades
were
held
together
by
rust
a
date
rack
which
had
not
been
turned
since
midsummer
five
years
ago
a
state
directory
five
years
old
a
sheet
of
with
julius
cæsar
julius

julius
cæsar
written
all
over
it
a
hundred
times
at
least
alternating
with
as
many
father
noahs
is
the
office
of
the
master
of
the
rolls
we
shall
be
undisturbed
here
said
my
friend
the
master
of
the
rolls
come
here
then
i
asked
has
been
here
these
five
years
and
now
he
ashamed
to
turn
up
who
does
his
work
librarian
what
is
his
work
in
a
department
like
the
board
of
payment
of
employés
salaries
messengers
sort
the
receipts
chronologically
and
alphabetically
and
send
them
to
the
the
librarian
supervises
their
being
placed
on
shelves
specially
adapted
for
the
purpose
the
conversation
now
seemed
to
amuse
struve
he
scribbled
a
word
every
now
and
then
on
his
cuff
and
as
falk
paused
he
thought
it
incumbent
on
him
to
ask
an
important
question
but
how
did
the
master
of
the
rolls
get
his
salary
it
was
sent
to
his
private
address
was
that
simple
enough
however
my
young
friend
advised
me
to
present
myself
to
the
actuary
and
ask
him
to
introduce
me
to
the
other
employés
who
were
now
dropping
in
to
poke
the
fires
in
their
tiled
stoves
and
enjoy
the
last
glimmer
of
the
glowing
wood
my
friend
told
me
that
the
actuary
was
an
influential
and
individual
very
susceptible
to
little
courtesies
i
who
had
come
across
him
in
his
character
as
registrar
of
the
exchequer
had
formed
a
different
opinion
of
him
but
believing
that
my
friend
knew
better
i
went
to
see
him
the
redoubtable
actuary
sat
in
a
capacious
with
his
feet
on
a
reindeer
skin
he
was
engaged
in
seasoning
a
real
meerschaum
pipe
sewn
up
in
soft
leather
so
as
not
to
appear
idle
he
was
glancing
at
yesterday
acquainting
himself
in
this
way
with
the
wishes
of
the
government
my
entrance
seemed
to
annoy
him
he
pushed
his
spectacles
on
to
his
bald
head
hiding
his
right
eye
behind
the
edge
of
the
newspaper
he
shot
a
conical
bullet
at
me
with
the
left
i
proffered
my
request
he
took
the
mouthpiece
of
his
meerschaum
into
his
right
hand
and
examined
it
to
find
out
how
far
he
had
coloured
it
the
dreadful
silence
which
followed
confirmed
my
apprehensions
he
cleared
his
throat
there
was
a
loud
hissing
noise
in
the
heap
of
glowing
coal
then
he
remembered
the
newspaper
and
continued
his
perusal
of
it
i
judged
it
wise
to
repeat
my
request
in
a
different
form
he
lost
his
temper
the
devil
do
you
want
what
are
you
doing
in
my
room
ca
i
have
peace
in
my
own
quarters
what
get
out
get
out
get
out
sir
i
say
ca
you
see
that
i
busy
go
to
the
protonotary
if
you
want
anything
do
come
here
bothering
me
i
went
to
the
protonotary
the
committee
of
supplies
was
sitting
it
had
been
sitting
for
three
weeks
already
the
protonotary
was
in
the
chair
and
three
clerks
were
keeping
the
minutes
the
samples
sent
in
by
the
purveyors
lay
scattered
about
on
the
tables
round
which
all
disengaged
clerks
copyists
and
notaries
were
assembled
in
spite
of
much
diversity
of
opinion
it
had
been
agreed
to
order
twenty
reams
of
lessebo
paper
and
after
repeatedly
testing
their
cutting
capacity
the
purchase
of
pairs
of
grantorp
scissors
which
had
been
awarded
a
prize
had
been
decided
on
the
actuary
held
shares
in
this
concern
the
test
writing
with
the
steel
nibs
had
taken
a
whole
week
and
the
minutes
concerning
it
had
taken
up
two
reams
of
paper
it
was
now
the
turn
of
the
penknives
and
the
committee
was
intent
on
testing
them
on
the
leaves
of
the
black
table
propose
ordering
sheffield
doubleblades
no
without
a
corkscrew
said
the
protonotary
cutting
a
splinter
off
the
table
large
enough
to
light
a
fire
with
does
the
first
notary
say
the
first
notary
who
had
cut
too
deeply
into
the
table
had
come
across
a
nail
and
damaged
an
eskilstuna
no
with
three
blades
suggested
buying
the
latter
after
everybody
had
given
his
opinion
and
alleged
reasons
for
holding
it
adding
practical
tests
the
chairman
suggested
buying
two
gross
of
sheffields
but
the
first
notary
protested
and
delivered
a
long
speech
which
was
taken
down
on
record
copied
out
twice
registered
sorted
alphabetically
and
chronologically
bound
and
placed
by
the
messenger
under
the
librarian
supervision
on
a
specially
adapted
shelf
this
protest
displayed
a
warm
patriotic
feeling
its
principal
object
was
the
demonstration
of
the
necessity
of
encouraging
home
industries
but
this
being
equivalent
to
a
charge
brought
against
the
government
seeing
that
it
was
brought
against
one
of
its
employés
the
protonotary
felt
it
his
duty
to
meet
it
he
started
with
a
historical
digression
on
the
origin
of
the
discount
on
manufactured
goods
at
the
word
discount
all
the
adjuncts
pricked
up
their
ears
touched
on
the
economic
developments
of
the
country
during
the
last
twenty
years
and
went
into
such
minute
details
that
the
clock
on
the
riddarholms
church
struck
two
before
he
had
arrived
at
his
subject
at
the
fatal
stroke
of
the
clock
the
whole
assembly
rushed
from
their
places
as
if
a
fire
had
broken
out
when
i
asked
a
colleague
what
it
all
meant
the
old
notary
who
had
heard
my
question
replied
primary
duty
of
a
government
employé
is
punctuality
sir
at
two
minutes
past
two
not
a
soul
was
left
in
one
of
the
rooms
shall
have
a
hot
day
whispered
a
colleague
as
we
went
downstairs
in
the
name
of
fortune
is
going
to
happen
i
asked
uneasily
pencils
he
replied
there
were
hot
days
in
store
for
us
envelopes
string
still
it
might
all
be
allowed
to
pass
for
every
one
was
occupied
but
a
day
came
when
there
was
nothing
to
do
i
took
my
courage
in
my
hands
and
asked
for
work
i
was
given
seven
reams
of
paper
for
making
fair
copies
at
home
a
feat
by
which
should
deserve
well
of
my
country
i
did
my
work
in
a
very
short
time
but
instead
of
receiving
appreciation
and
encouragement
i
was
treated
with
suspicion
industrious
people
were
not
in
favour
since
then
i
had
no
work
i
spare
you
the
tedious
recital
of
a
year
humiliations
the
countless
taunts
the
endless
bitterness
everything
which
appeared
small
and
ridiculous
to
me
was
treated
with
grave
solemnity
and
everything
which
i
considered
great
and
praiseworthy
was
scoffed
at
the
people
were
called
mob
and
their
only
use
was
to
be
shot
at
by
the
army
if
occasion
should
arise
the
new
form
of
government
was
openly
reviled
and
the
peasants
were
called
traitors
a
a
since
the
great
reorganization
of
the
public
offices
this
description
is
no
longer
true
to
life
i
had
to
listen
to
this
sort
of
thing
for
seven
months
they
began
to
suspect
me
because
i
did
join
in
their
laughter
and
challenged
me
next
time
the
dogs
were
attacked
i
exploded
and
made
a
speech
the
result
of
which
was
that
they
knew
where
i
stood
and
that
i
was
henceforth
impossible
and
now
i
shall
do
what
so
many
other
shipwrecks
have
done
i
shall
throw
myself
into
the
arms
of
literature
struve
who
seemed
dissatisfied
with
the
truncated
ending
put
the
pencil
back
sipped
his
toddy
and
looked
nevertheless
he
thought
he
ought
to
say
something
my
dear
fellow
he
remarked
at
last
you
have
yet
learned
the
art
of
living
you
will
find
out
how
difficult
it
is
to
earn
bread
and
butter
and
how
it
gradually
becomes
the
main
interest
one
works
to
eat
and
eats
to
be
able
to
work
believe
me
who
have
wife
and
child
that
i
know
what
i
talking
about
you
must
cut
your
coat
according
to
your
cloth
you
see
according
to
your
cloth
and
you
no
idea
what
the
position
of
a
writer
is
he
stands
outside
society
his
punishment
for
aspiring
to
stand
above
it
moreover
i
detest
society
for
it
is
not
founded
on
a
voluntary
basis
it
a
web
of
lies
i
renounce
it
with
pleasure
it
beginning
to
grow
chilly
said
struve
yes
shall
we
go
perhaps
we
better
the
flame
of
conversation
had
flickered
out
meanwhile
the
sun
had
set
the
half
moon
had
risen
and
hung
over
the
fields
to
the
north
of
the
town
star
after
star
struggled
with
the
daylight
which
still
lingered
in
the
sky
the
were
being
lighted
in
the
town
the
noise
and
uproar
was
beginning
to
die
away
falk
and
struve
walked
together
in
the
direction
of
the
north
talking
of
commerce
navigation
the
crafts
everything
in
fact
which
did
not
interest
them
finally
to
each
other
relief
they
parted
falk
strolled
down
river
street
towards
the
dockyard
his
brain
pregnant
with
new
thoughts
he
felt
like
a
bird
which
had
flown
against
a
and
now
lay
bruised
on
the
ground
at
the
very
moment
when
it
had
spread
its
wings
to
fly
towards
freedom
he
sat
down
on
a
seat
listening
to
the
splashing
of
the
waves
a
light
breeze
had
sprung
up
and
rustled
through
the
flowering
maple
trees
and
the
faint
light
of
the
half
moon
shone
on
the
black
water
twenty
thirty
boats
lay
moored
on
the
quay
they
tore
at
their
chains
for
a
moment
raised
their
heads
one
after
the
other
and
dived
down
again
underneath
the
water
wind
and
wave
seemed
to
drive
them
onward
they
made
little
runs
towards
the
bridge
like
a
pack
of
hounds
but
the
chain
held
them
in
leash
and
left
them
kicking
and
stamping
as
if
they
were
eager
to
break
loose
he
remained
in
his
seat
till
midnight
the
wind
fell
asleep
the
waves
went
to
rest
the
fettered
boats
ceased
tugging
at
their
chains
the
maples
stopped
rustling
and
the
dew
was
beginning
to
fall
then
he
rose
and
strolled
home
dreaming
to
his
lonely
attic
in
the
part
of
the
town
that
is
what
young
falk
did
but
old
struve
who
on
the
same
day
had
become
a
member
of
the
staff
of
the
because
the
had
sacked
him
went
home
and
wrote
an
article
for
the
notorious
on
the
board
of
payment
of
employés
salaries
four
columns
at
five
crowns
a

chapter

between

the

of
the

merchant
one
of
the

elders
of

of

insurance
charles
john
falk
and
brother
of
the
former
assessor
and
present
writer
arvid
falk
had
a
business
or
as
his
enemies
preferred
to
call
it
a
shop
in
long
street
east
nearly
opposite
pig
street
so
that
the
young
man
who
sat
behind
the
counter
surreptitiously
reading
a
novel
could
see
a
piece
of
a
steamer
the
perhaps
or
the
and
the
crown
of
a
tree
on
skeppsholm
with
a
patch
of
sky
above
it
whenever
he
raised
his
eyes
from
his
book
the
shop
assistant
who
answered
to
the
not
unusual
name
of
andersson
and
he
had
learnt
to
answer
to
it
had
just
it
was
early
in
the
morning
opened
the
shop
hung
up
outside
the
door
a
flax
tress
a
fish
and
an
eel
basket
a
bundle
of
and
a
crawl
of
unstripped
quills
this
done
he
had
swept
the
shop
strewn
the
floor
with
sawdust
and
sat
down
behind
the
counter
he
had
converted
an
empty
into
a
kind
of
which
he
set
with
a
hooked
stick
immediately
on
the
appearance
of
his
principal
or
any
of
the
friends
the
novel
on
which
andersson
was
intent
dropped
into
the
box
he
did
not
seem
afraid
of
customers
for
one
thing
it
was
early
in
the
morning
and
for
another
he
was
not
used
to
very
many
customers
the
business
had
been
established
in
the
days
of
the
late
king
frederick
charles
nicholas
falk
had
inherited
this
statement
from
his
father
to
whom
it
had
descended
from
his
grandfather
it
had
flourished
and
earned
a
good
deal
of
money
until
a
few
years
ago
but
the
disastrous
killed
trade
ruined
all
prospects
impeded
all
enterprise
and
threatened
all
citizens
with
bankruptcy
so
at
least
falk
said
others
were
inclined
to
believe
that
the
business
was
mismanaged
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
a
dangerous
competitor
had
established
himself
close
to
the
lock
falk
never
talked
of
the
decline
of
the
business
if
he
could
help
it
and
he
was
shrewd
enough
carefully
to
choose
occasion
and
audience
whenever
he
touched
upon
string
if
an
old
business
connexion
expressed
surprise
in
a
friendly
way
at
the
reduced
trade
he
told
him
that
his
principal
business
was
a
wholesale
trade
in
the
provinces
and
that
he
was
looking
upon
the
shop
merely
in
the
light
of
a
nobody
doubted
this
for
he
had
behind
the
shop
a
small
where
he
generally
could
be
found
when
he
was
not
in
town
or
at
the
exchange
but
it
was
quite
another
tale
if
any
of
his
acquaintances
such
as
the
notary
or
the
schoolmaster
for
instance
expressed
the
same
friendly
uneasiness
then
he
blamed
the
bad
times
the
result
of
the
new
this
alone
was
to
blame
for
the
stagnation
of
trade
andersson
was
disturbed
in
his
reading
by
two
or
three
boys
who
were
standing
in
the
doorway
asking
the
price
of
the
looking
out
into
the
street
he
caught
sight
of
our
arvid
falk
falk
had
lent
him
the
book
so
that
it
could
safely
be
left
on
the
counter
and
as
his
former
playfellow
entered
the
shop
he
greeted
him
familiarly
with
a
knowing
look
is
he
upstairs
asked
falk
not
without
a
certain
uneasiness
he
at
breakfast
replied
andersson
pointing
to
the
ceiling
a
chair
was
pushed
back
on
the
floor
above
their
heads
he
got
up
from
the
table
now
mr
arvid
both
young
men
seemed
familiar
with
the
noise
and
its
purport
heavy
creaking
footsteps
crossed
the
floor
apparently
in
all
directions
and
a
subdued
murmur
penetrated
through
the
ceiling
to
the
listeners
below
was
he
at
home
last
night
asked
falk
no
he
was
out
with
friends
or
acquaintances
acquaintances
did
he
come
home
late
very
late
do
you
think
he
be
coming
down
soon
andersson
i
do
want
to
go
upstairs
on
account
of
my
he
be
here
directly
i
can
tell
by
his
footsteps
a
door
slammed
upstairs
they
looked
at
each
other
significantly
arvid
made
a
movement
towards
the
door
but
pulled
himself
together
a
few
moments
later
they
heard
sounds
in
the
a
violent
cough
shook
the
little
room
and
then
came
the
footsteps
saying
stamp
stamp
stamp
stamp
arvid
went
behind
the
counter
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
come
in
he
stood
before
his
brother
a
man
of
forty
who
looked
his
age
he
was
fifteen
years
older
than
arvid
and
for
that
and
other
reasons
he
had
accustomed
himself
to
look
upon
his
younger
brother
as
a
boy
towards
whom
he
acted
as
a
father
he
had
fair
hair
a
fair
moustache
fair
eyebrows
and
he
was
rather
stout
and
that
was
the
reason
why
his
boots
always
creaked
they
groaned
under
the
weight
of
his
figure
oh
it
only
you
he
said
with
contempt
this
attitude
of
mind
was
typical
of
the
man
he
was
never
angry
with
those
who
for
some
reason
or
other
could
be
considered
his
inferiors
he
despised
them
but
his
face
expressed
disappointment
he
had
expected
a
more
satisfactory
subject
for
an
outburst
his
brother
was
shy
and
modest
and
never
offered
resistance
if
he
could
possibly
help
it
i
hope
i
not
inconveniencing
you
brother
charles
asked
arvid
standing
on
the
threshold
this
humble
question
disposed
the
brother
to
show
benevolence
he
helped
himself
to
a
cigar
from
his
big
embroidered
leather
offering
his
brother
a
smoke
from
a
box
which
stood
near
the
that
boxful
visitors
cigars
as
he
frankly
called
them
and
he
was
of
a
candid
disposition
had
been
through
a
shipwreck
which
made
them
interesting
but
did
not
improve
them
and
a
sale
by
auction
on
the
strand
which
had
made
them
very
cheap
well
what
is
it
you
want
asked
charles
nicholas
lighting
his
cigar
and
putting
the
match
into
his
pocket
he
could
only
concentrate
his
thoughts
on
one
spot
inside
a
not
very
large
circumference
his
tailor
could
have
expressed
the
size
of
it
in
inches
after
measuring
him
round
the
stomach
i
want
to
talk
business
with
you
answered
arvid
fingering
his
unlighted
cigar
sit
down
commanded
the
brother
it
was
customary
with
him
to
ask
people
to
sit
down
whenever
he
intended
to
take
them
to
task
he
had
them
under
him
then
and
it
was
more
easy
to
crush
them
if
necessary
business
are
we
doing
business
together
he
began
i
do
know
anything
about
it
are
you
doing
business
are
you
i
only
meant
to
say
that
i
should
like
to
know
whether
anything
more
coming
to
me
what
may
i
ask
do
you
mean
money
said
charles
nicholas
jestingly
allowing
his
brother
to
enjoy
the
scent
of
his
good
cigar
as
the
reply
which
he
did
not
want
was
not
forthcoming
he
went
on
coming
to
you
have
you
received
everything
due
to
you
have
you
yourself
receipted
the
account
for
the
court
of
wards
have
i
kept
and
clothed
you
since
to
be
strictly
correct
have
i
made
you
a
loan
according
to
your
own
wish
to
be
paid
back
when
you
are
able
to
do
so
i
put
it
all
down
in
readiness
for
the
day
when
you
will
be
earning
your
livelihood
a
thing
which
you
not
done
yet
i
going
to
do
it
now
and
that
why
i
here
i
wanted
to
know
whether
there
still
anything
owing
to
me
or
whether
i
am
in
debt
the
brother
cast
a
penetrating
look
at
his
victim
wondering
whether
he
had
any
mental
reservations
his
creaking
boots
began
stamping
the
floor
on
a
diagonal
line
between
spittoon
and
the
trinkets
on
his
tinkled
a
warning
to
people
not
to
cross
his
way
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
rose
and
lay
in
long
ominous
clouds
portentous
of
a
thunderstorm
between
tiled
stove
and
door
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
furiously
his
head
bowed
his
shoulders
rounded
as
if
he
were
rehearsing
a
part
when
he
thought
he
knew
it
he
stopped
short
before
his
brother
gazed
into
his
eyes
with
a
long
glinting
deceitful
look
intended
to
express
both
confidence
and
sorrow
and
said
in
a
voice
meant
to
sound
as
if
it
came
from
the
family
grave
in
the
churchyard
of
clara
you
not
straight
arvid
you
not
straight
who
with
the
exception
of
andersson
who
was
standing
behind
the
door
listening
would
not
have
been
touched
by
those
words
spoken
by
a
brother
to
a
brother
fraught
with
the
deepest
brotherly
sorrow
even
arvid
accustomed
from
his
childhood
to
believe
all
men
perfect
and
himself
alone
unworthy
wondered
for
a
moment
whether
he
was
straight
or
not
and
as
his
education
by
efficacious
means
had
provided
him
with
a
highly
sensitive
conscience
he
found
that
he
really
had
not
been
quite
straight
or
at
least
quite
frank
when
he
asked
his
brother
the
candid
question
as
to
whether
he
was
a
scoundrel
i
come
to
the
conclusion
he
said
that
you
cheated
me
out
of
a
part
of
my
inheritance
i
calculated
that
you
charged
too
much
for
your
inferior
board
and
your
clothes
i
know
that
i
spend
all
my
fortune
during
my
terrible
college
days
and
i
believe
that
you
owe
me
a
fairly
big
sum
i
want
it
now
and
i
request
you
to
hand
it
over
to
me
a
smile
illuminated
the
brother
fair
face
and
with
an
expression
so
calm
and
a
gesture
so
steady
that
he
might
have
been
rehearsing
them
for
years
so
as
to
be
in
readiness
when
his
cue
was
given
to
him
he
put
his
hand
in
his
trousers
pocket
rattled
his
bunch
of
keys
before
taking
it
out
threw
it
up
and
dexterously
caught
it
again
and
walked
solemnly
to
his
safe
he
opened
it
more
quickly
than
he
intended
and
perhaps
than
the
sacredness
of
the
spot
justified
took
out
a
paper
lying
ready
to
his
hand
and
evidently
also
waiting
for
its
cue
and
handed
it
to
his
brother
did
you
write
this
answer
me
did
you
write
it
yes
arvid
rose
and
turned
towards
the
door
do
go
sit
down
sit
down
if
a
dog
had
been
present
it
would
have
sat
down
at
once
what
written
here
read
it
arvid
falk
acknowledge
and
testify
that
i
have
received
from
my
brother
charles
nicholas
falk
who
was
appointed
my
guardian
my
inheritance
in
full
amounting
to
and
so
on
he
was
ashamed
to
mention
the
sum
you
have
acknowledged
and
testified
a
fact
which
you
did
not
believe
is
that
straight
no
answer
my
question
is
that
straight
no
therefore
you
have
borne
false
witness
ergo
you
a
blackguard
yes
that
what
you
are
am
i
right
the
part
was
too
excellent
and
the
triumph
too
great
to
be
enjoyed
without
an
audience
the
innocently
accused
must
have
witnesses
he
opened
the
door
leading
into
the
shop
andersson
he
shouted
answer
this
question
listen
to
me
if
i
bear
false
witness
am
i
a
blackguard
or
not
of
course
you
are
a
blackguard
sir
andersson
answered
unhesitatingly
and
with
warmth
do
you
hear
he
says
i
a
blackguard
if
i
put
my
signature
to
a
false
receipt
what
did
i
say
you
not
straight
arvid
you
are
not
straight
people
often
are
blackguards
you
have
always
been
and
yielding
but
i
always
been
aware
that
in
your
secret
heart
you
harboured
very
different
thoughts
you
a
blackguard
your
father
always
said
so
i
say
for
he
always
said
what
he
thought
and
he
was
a
straight
man
arvid
and
that
you
are
not
and
you
may
be
sure
that
if
he
were
still
alive
he
would
say
with
grief
and
pain
not
straight
arvid
you
are
not
straight
he
did
a
few
more
diagonal
lines
and
it
sounded
as
if
he
were
applauding
the
scene
with
his
feet
he
rattled
his
bunch
of
keys
as
if
he
were
giving
the
signal
for
the
curtain
to
rise
his
closing
remarks
had
been
so
rounded
off
that
the
smallest
addition
would
have
spoilt
the
whole
in
spite
of
the
heavy
charge
which
he
had
actually
expected
for
years
for
he
had
always
believed
his
brother
to
be
acting
a
part
he
was
very
glad
that
it
was
over
happily
over
well
and
cleverly
over
so
that
he
felt
almost
gay
and
even
a
little
grateful
moreover
he
had
had
a
splendid
chance
of
venting
the
wrath
which
had
been
kindled
upstairs
in
his
family
on
some
one
to
vent
it
on
andersson
had
lost
its
charm
and
he
knew
better
than
to
vent
it
on
his
wife
arvid
was
silent
the
education
he
had
received
had
so
intimidated
him
that
he
always
believed
himself
to
be
in
the
wrong
since
his
childhood
the
great
words
upright
honest
sincere
true
had
daily
and
hourly
been
drummed
into
his
ears
so
that
they
stood
before
him
like
a
judge
continuously
saying
guilty
for
a
moment
he
thought
that
he
must
have
been
mistaken
in
his
calculations
that
his
brother
must
be
innocent
and
he
himself
a
scoundrel
but
immediately
after
he
realized
that
his
brother
was
a
cheat
deceiving
him
by
a
simple
lawyer
trick
he
felt
prompted
to
run
away
fearful
of
being
drawn
into
a
quarrel
to
run
away
without
making
his
request
number
two
and
confessing
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
changing
his
profession
there
was
a
long
pause
charles
nicholas
had
plenty
of
time
to
recapitulate
his
triumph
in
his
memory
that
little
word
blackguard
had
done
his
tongue
good
it
had
been
as
pleasant
as
if
he
had
said
get
out
and
the
opening
of
the
door
andersson
reply
and
the
production
of
the
paper
everything
had
passed
off
splendidly
he
had
not
forgotten
the
bunch
of
keys
on
his
he
had
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
without
any
difficulty
his
proof
was
binding
as
a
rope
the
conclusion
he
had
drawn
had
been
the
baited
hook
by
which
the
fish
had
been
caught
he
had
regained
his
good
temper
he
had
forgiven
nay
he
had
forgotten
and
as
he
slammed
the
door
of
the
safe
he
shut
away
the
disagreeable
story
for
ever
but
he
did
not
want
to
part
from
his
brother
in
this
mood
he
wanted
to
talk
to
him
on
other
subjects
throw
a
few
shovelfuls
of
gossip
on
the
unpleasant
affair
see
him
under
commonplace
circumstances
sitting
at
his
table
for
instance
and
why
not
eating
and
drinking
people
always
looked
happy
and
content
when
they
were
eating
and
drinking
he
wanted
so
see
him
happy
and
content
he
wanted
to
see
his
face
calm
listen
to
his
voice
speaking
without
a
tremor
and
he
resolved
to
ask
him
to
luncheon
but
he
felt
puzzled
how
to
lead
up
to
it
find
a
suitable
bridge
across
the
gulf
he
searched
his
brain
but
found
nothing
he
searched
his
pockets
and
found
the
match
hang
it
all
you
never
lit
your
cigar
old
boy
he
exclaimed
with
genuine
not
feigned
warmth
but
the
old
boy
had
crushed
his
cigar
during
the
conversation
so
that
it
would
not
draw
look
here
take
another
and
he
pulled
out
his
big
leather
case
here
take
one
of
these
they
are
good
ones
arvid
who
unfortunately
could
not
bear
to
hurt
anybody
feelings
accepted
it
gratefully
like
a
hand
offered
in
reconciliation
now
old
boy
continued
charles
nicholas
talking
lightly
and
pleasantly
an
accomplishment
at
which
he
was
an
expert
let
go
to
the
nearest
restaurant
and
have
lunch
come
along
arvid
unused
to
friendliness
was
so
touched
by
these
advances
that
he
hastily
pressed
his
brother
hand
and
hurried
away
through
the
shop
without
taking
any
notice
of
andersson
and
out
into
the
street
the
brother
felt
embarrassed
he
could
not
understand
it
to
run
away
when
he
had
been
asked
to
lunch
to
run
away
when
he
was
not
in
the
least
angry
with
him
to
run
away
no
dog
would
have
run
away
if
a
piece
of
meat
had
been
thrown
to
him
he
a
queer
chap
he
muttered
stamping
the
floor
then
he
went
to
his
desk
screwed
up
the
seat
of
his
chair
as
high
as
it
would
go
and
climbed
up
from
this
raised
position
he
was
in
the
habit
of
contemplating
men
and
circumstances
as
from
a
higher
point
of
view
and
he
found
them
small
yet
not
so
small
that
he
could
not
use
them
for
his
purposes
chapter
iii
the
artists
colony
it
was
between
eight
and
nine
on
the
same
beautiful
may
morning
arvid
falk
after
the
scene
with
his
brother
was
strolling
through
the
streets
dissatisfied
with
himself
his
brother
and
the
whole
world
he
would
have
preferred
to
see
the
sky
overcast
to
be
in
bad
company
he
did
not
believe
that
he
was
a
blackguard
but
he
was
disappointed
with
the
part
he
had
played
he
was
accustomed
to
be
severe
on
himself
and
it
had
always
been
drummed
into
him
that
his
brother
was
a
kind
of
stepfather
to
whom
he
owed
great
respect
not
to
say
reverence
but
he
was
worried
and
depressed
by
other
thoughts
as
well
he
had
neither
money
nor
prospect
of
work
the
last
contingency
was
perhaps
the
worse
of
the
two
for
to
him
with
his
exuberant
imagination
idleness
was
a
dangerous
enemy
brooding
over
these
disagreeable
facts
he
had
reached
little
garden
street
he
sauntered
along
on
the
left
pavement
passed
the
dramatic
theatre
and
soon
reached
high
street
north
he
walked
on
aimlessly
the
pavement
became
uneven
wooden
cottages
took
the
place
of
the
stone
houses
badly
dressed
men
and
women
were
throwing
suspicious
glances
at
the
stranger
who
was
visiting
their
quarter
at
such
an
early
hour
famished
dogs
growled
threateningly
at
him
he
hastened
past
groups
of
gunners
labourers
brewers
men
laundresses
and
apprentices
and
finally
came
to
great
street
he
entered
the
the
cows
belonging
to
the
of
ordnance
were
grazing
in
the
fields
the
old
bare
apple
trees
were
making
the
first
efforts
to
put
forth
buds
but
the
lime
trees
were
already
in
leaf
and
squirrels
were
playing
up
and
down
the
branches
he
passed
the
and
came
to
the
avenue
leading
to
the
theatre
here
he
met
some
truant
schoolboys
engaged
in
a
game
of
buttons
a
little
further
a
painter
apprentice
was
lying
in
the
grass
on
his
back
staring
at
the
clouds
through
the
dome
of
foliage
he
was
whistling
carelessly
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
master
and
men
were
waiting
for
him
while
flies
and
other
insects
drowned
themselves
in
his
falk
had
walked
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
had
come
to
the
he
stood
still
for
a
while
studying
the
metamorphoses
of
the
frogs
watching
the
leeches
catching
a
then
he
began
to
throw
stones
the
exercise
brought
his
blood
into
circulation
he
felt
rejuvenated
a
schoolboy
playing
truant
free
defiantly
free
it
was
freedom
bought
by
great
the
thought
of
being
able
to
commune
with
nature
freely
and
at
will
made
him
glad
he
understood
nature
better
than
men
who
had
only
and
slandered
him
his
unrest
disappeared
he
rose
and
continued
his
way
further
into
the
country
walking
through
the
cross
he
came
into
street
north
some
of
the
boards
were
missing
in
the
fence
facing
him
and
there
was
a
very
plainly
marked
footpath
on
the
other
side
he
crept
through
the
hole
disturbing
an
old
woman
who
was
gathering
nettles
crossed
the
large
tobacco
field
where
a
colony
of
villas
has
now
sprung
up
and
found
himself
at
the
gate
of
there
was
no
doubt
of
its
being
spring
in
the
little
settlement
consisting
of
three
cottages
snugly
nestling
among
elders
and
apple
trees
and
sheltered
from
the
north
wind
by
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
high
road
the
visitor
was
regaled
with
a
perfect
little
idyll
a
cock
perched
on
the
shafts
of
a
watercart
was
basking
in
the
sun
and
catching
flies
the
bees
hung
in
a
cloud
round
the
the
gardener
was
kneeling
by
the
sorting
radishes
the
warblers
and
were
singing
in
the
gooseberry
bushes
while
lightly
clad
children
chased
the
fowls
bent
on
examining
the
germinative
capacity
of
various
newly
sown
seeds
a
brilliant
blue
sky
spanned
the
scene
and
the
dark
forest
framed
the
background
two
men
were
sitting
close
to
the
in
the
shelter
of
the
fence
one
of
them
wearing
a
tall
black
hat
and
a
threadbare
black
suit
had
a
long
narrow
pale
face
and
looked
like
a
clergyman
with
his
stout
but
deformed
body
drooping
eyelids
and
mongolian
moustache
the
other
one
belonged
to
the
type
of
civilized
peasant
he
was
very
badly
dressed
and
might
have
been
many
things
a
vagabond
an
artisan
or
an
artist
he
looked
seedy
but
seedy
in
an
original
way
the
lean
man
who
obviously
felt
chilly
although
he
sat
right
in
the
sun
was
reading
to
his
friend
from
a
book
the
latter
looked
as
though
he
had
tried
all
the
climates
of
the
earth
and
was
able
to
stand
them
all
equally
well
as
falk
entered
the
garden
gate
from
the
high
road
he
could
distinctly
hear
the
reader
words
through
the
fence
and
he
thought
it
no
breach
of
confidence
to
stand
still
for
a
while
and
listen
the
lean
man
was
reading
in
a
dry
monotonous
voice
a
voice
without
resonance
and
his
stout
friend
every
now
and
then
acknowledged
his
appreciation
by
a
snort
which
changed
occasionally
into
a
grunt
and
became
a
splutter
whenever
the
words
of
wisdom
to
which
he
was
listening
surpassed
ordinary
human
understanding
highest
principles
are
as
already
stated
three
one
absolutely
unconditioned
and
two
relatively
unconditioned
ones
the
absolutely
first
purely
unconditioned
principle
would
express
the
action
underlying
all
consciousness
and
without
which
consciousness
can
not
exist
this
principle
is
the
identity
a
a
it
endures
and
can
not
be
disposed
of
by
thought
when
all
empirical
definitions
of
consciousness
are
prescinded
it
is
the
original
fact
of
consciousness
and
must
therefore
of
necessity
be
acknowledged
moreover
it
is
not
conditioned
like
every
other
empirical
fact
but
as
consequence
and
substance
of
a
voluntary
act
entirely
unconditioned
do
you
follow
olle
asked
the
reader
interrupting
himself
it
amazing
it
is
not
conditioned
like
every
other
empirical
fact
oh
what
a
man
go
on
go
on
it
is
maintained
continued
the
reader
this
proposition
without
any
further
proof
be
true
oh
i
say
what
a
rascal
without
any
further
proof
be
true
repeated
the
grateful
listener
bent
on
dissipating
all
suspicion
that
he
had
not
grasped
what
had
been
read
without
any
reason
how
subtle
how
subtle
of
him
to
say
that
instead
of
simply
saying
any
reason
am
i
to
continue
or
do
you
intend
to
go
on
interrupting
me
asked
the
offended
reader
i
wo
interrupt
again
go
on
go
on
well
now
he
draws
the
conclusion
really
excellent
one
ascribes
to
oneself
the
ability
to
state
a
proposition
olle
snorted
does
not
propose
thereby
a
capital
a
but
merely
that
a
a
if
and
in
so
far
as
a
exists
at
all
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
essence
of
an
assertion
but
only
of
its
form
the
proposition
a
a
is
therefore
conditioned
hypothetically
as
far
as
its
essence
is
concerned
and
unconditioned
only
as
far
as
its
form
goes
have
you
noticed
the
capital
a
falk
had
heard
enough
this
was
the
terribly
profound
philosophy
of
upsala
which
had
strayed
to
stockholm
to
conquer
and
subdue
the
coarse
instincts
of
the
capital
he
looked
at
the
fowls
to
see
whether
they
had
not
tumbled
off
their
roosts
at
the
parsley
whether
it
had
not
stopped
growing
while
made
to
listen
to
the
profoundest
wisdom
ever
proclaimed
by
human
voice
at
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
sky
had
not
fallen
after
witnessing
such
a
feat
of
mental
strength
at
the
same
time
his
base
human
nature
clamoured
for
attention
his
throat
was
parched
and
he
decided
to
ask
for
a
glass
of
water
at
one
of
the
cottages
turning
back
he
strolled
towards
the
hut
on
the
side
of
the
road
coming
from
town
the
door
leading
into
a
large
room
once
a
bakery
from
an
the
size
of
a
travelling
trunk
stood
open
the
room
contained
a
a
broken
chair
an
easel
and
two
men
one
of
them
wearing
only
a
shirt
and
a
pair
of
trousers
kept
up
by
a
leather
belt
was
standing
before
the
easel
he
looked
like
a
journeyman
but
he
was
an
artist
making
a
sketch
for
an
the
other
man
was
a
youth
with
features
and
considering
his
environment
clothes
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
turned
back
his
shirt
and
was
serving
as
the
artist
model
his
handsome
noble
face
showed
traces
of
a
night
of
dissipation
and
every
now
and
then
he
dozed
each
time
reprimanded
by
the
master
who
seemed
to
have
taken
him
under
his
protection
as
falk
was
entering
the
room
he
heard
the
burden
of
one
of
these
reprimands
that
you
should
make
such
a
hog
of
yourself
and
spend
the
night
drinking
with
that
loafer
sellén
and
now
be
standing
here
wasting
your
time
instead
of
being
at
the
commercial
school
the
right
shoulder
a
little
higher
please
that
better
is
it
true
that
you
spent
all
the
money
for
your
rent
and
dare
go
home
have
you
nothing
left
not
one
farthing
i
still
have
some
but
it
wo
go
far
the
young
man
pulled
a
scrap
of
paper
out
of
his
trousers
pocket
and
straightening
it
out
produced
two
notes
for
a
crown
each
give
them
to
me
i
take
care
of
them
for
you
exclaimed
the
master
seizing
them
with
fatherly
solicitude
falk
who
had
vainly
tried
to
attract
their
attention
thought
it
best
to
depart
as
quietly
as
he
had
come
once
more
passing
the
manure
heap
and
the
two
philosophers
he
turned
to
the
left
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
caught
sight
of
a
young
man
who
had
put
up
his
easel
at
the
edge
of
a
little
bog
planted
with
alder
trees
close
to
the
wood
he
had
a
graceful
slight
almost
elegant
figure
and
a
thin
dark
face
he
seemed
to
scintillate
life
as
he
stood
before
his
easel
working
at
a
fine
picture
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
hat
and
appeared
to
be
in
excellent
health
and
spirits
alternately
talking
to
himself
and
whistling
or
humming
snatches
of
song
when
falk
was
near
enough
to
have
him
in
profile
he
turned
round
sellén
good
morning
old
chap
falk
fancy
meeting
you
out
here
in
the
wood
what
the
deuce
does
it
mean
ought
you
to
be
at
your
office
at
this
time
of
day
no
but
are
you
living
out
here
yes
i
came
here
on
the
first
of
april
with
some
pals
found
life
in
town
too
expensive
and
moreover
landlords
are
so
particular
a
sly
smile
played
about
one
of
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
his
brown
eyes
flashed
i
see
falk
began
again
then
perhaps
you
know
the
two
individuals
who
were
sitting
by
the
just
now
reading
the
philosophers
of
course
i
do
the
tall
one
is
an
assistant
at
the
public
sales
office
at
a
salary
of
eighty
crowns
per
annum
and
the
short
one
olle
montanus
ought
to
be
at
home
at
his
sculpture
but
since
he
and
ygberg
have
taken
up
philosophy
he
has
left
off
working
and
is
fast
going
down
hill
he
has
discovered
that
there
is
something
sensual
in
art
what
he
living
on
on
nothing
at
all
occasionally
he
sits
to
the
practical
lundell
and
then
he
gets
a
piece
of
black
pudding
this
lasts
him
for
about
a
day
in
the
winter
lundell
lets
him
lie
on
his
floor
helps
to
warm
the
room
he
says
and
wood
is
very
dear
it
was
very
cold
here
in
april
how
can
he
be
a
model
he
looks
such
a
sort
of
chap
he
poses
for
one
of
the
thieves
in
lundell
descent
from
the
cross
the
one
whose
bones
are
already
broken
the
poor
devil
suffering
from
hip
disease
he
does
splendidly
when
he
leans
across
the
back
of
a
chair
sometimes
the
artist
makes
him
turn
his
back
to
him
then
he
represents
the
other
thief
but
why
does
he
work
himself
has
he
no
talent
olle
montanus
my
dear
fellow
is
a
genius
but
he
wo
work
he
a
philosopher
and
would
have
become
a
great
man
if
he
could
have
gone
to
college
it
really
extraordinary
to
listen
to
him
and
ygberg
talking
philosophy
it
true
ygberg
has
read
more
but
in
spite
of
that
montanus
with
his
subtle
brain
succeeds
in
cornering
him
every
now
and
again
then
ygberg
goes
away
and
reads
some
more
but
he
never
lends
the
book
to
montanus
i
see
and
you
like
ygberg
philosophy
asked
falk
oh
it
subtle
wonderfully
subtle
you
like
fichte
do
you
i
say
what
a
man
who
were
the
two
individuals
in
the
cottage
asked
falk
who
did
not
like
fichte
oh
you
saw
them
too
one
of
them
was
the
practical
lundell
a
painter
of
figures
or
rather
sacred
subjects
the
other
one
was
my
friend
rehnhjelm
he
pronounced
the
last
few
words
with
the
utmost
indifference
so
as
to
heighten
their
effect
as
much
as
possible
rehnhjelm
yes
a
very
nice
fellow
he
was
acting
as
lundell
model
was
he
that
like
lundell
he
knows
how
to
make
use
of
people
he
is
extraordinarily
practical
but
come
along
let
worry
him
it
the
only
fun
i
have
out
here
then
perhaps
you
hear
montanus
speaking
and
that
really
worth
while
less
for
the
sake
of
hearing
montanus
speaking
than
for
the
sake
of
obtaining
a
glass
of
water
falk
followed
sellén
helping
him
to
carry
easel
and
paintbox
the
scene
in
the
cottage
was
slightly
changed
the
model
was
now
sitting
on
the
broken
chair
and
montanus
and
ygberg
on
the
lundell
was
standing
at
his
easel
smoking
his
seedy
friends
watched
him
and
his
old
snoring
pipe
the
very
presence
of
a
pipe
and
tobacco
raised
their
spirits
falk
was
introduced
and
immediately
lundell
monopolized
him
asking
him
for
his
opinion
of
the
picture
he
was
painting
it
was
a
rubens
at
least
as
far
as
the
subject
went
though
anything
but
a
rubens
in
colour
and
drawing
thereupon
lundell
dilated
on
the
hard
times
and
difficulties
of
an
artist
severely
criticized
the
academy
and
censured
the
government
for
neglecting
native
art
he
was
engaged
in
sketching
an
although
he
was
convinced
that
it
would
be
refused
for
nobody
could
succeed
without
intrigues
and
connexions
and
he
scrutinized
falk
clothes
wondering
whether
might
be
a
useful
connexion
falk
appearance
had
produced
a
different
effect
on
the
two
philosophers
they
scented
a
man
of
letters
in
him
and
hated
him
because
he
might
rob
them
of
the
reputation
they
enjoyed
in
the
small
circle
they
exchanged
significant
glances
immediately
understood
by
sellén
who
found
it
impossible
to
resist
the
temptation
of
showing
off
his
friends
in
their
glory
and
if
possible
bring
about
an
encounter
he
soon
found
an
apple
of
discord
aimed
threw
and
hit
what
do
you
say
to
lundell
picture
ygberg
ygberg
not
expecting
to
be
called
upon
to
speak
so
soon
had
to
consider
his
answer
for
a
few
seconds
then
he
made
his
reply
raising
his
voice
while
olle
rubbed
his
back
to
make
him
hold
himself
straight
a
work
of
art
may
in
my
opinion
be
divided
into
two
categories
subject
and
form
with
regard
to
the
subject
in
this
work
of
art
there
is
no
denying
that
it
is
profound
and
universally
human
the
motive
properly
speaking
is
in
itself
fertile
and
contains
all
the
potentialities
of
artistic
work
with
regard
to
the
form
which
of
itself
shall
manifest
the
idea
that
is
to
say
the
absolute
identity
the
being
the
ego
i
can
not
help
saying
that
i
find
it
less
adequate
lundell
was
obviously
flattered
olle
smiled
his
sunniest
smile
as
if
he
were
contemplating
the
heavenly
hosts
the
model
was
asleep
and
sellén
found
that
ygberg
had
scored
a
complete
success
all
eyes
were
turned
on
falk
who
was
compelled
to
take
up
the
gauntlet
for
no
one
doubted
that
ygberg
criticism
was
a
challenge
falk
was
both
amused
and
annoyed
he
was
searching
the
limbo
of
memory
for
philosophical
when
he
caught
sight
of
olle
montanus
whose
convulsed
face
betrayed
his
desire
to
speak
falk
loaded
his
gun
at
random
with
aristotle
and
fired
what
do
you
mean
by
adequate
i
can
not
recollect
that
aristotle
made
use
of
that
word
in
his
metaphysics
absolute
silence
fell
on
the
room
everybody
felt
that
a
fight
between
the
artist
colony
and
the
university
of
upsala
was
imminent
the
interval
was
longer
than
was
desirable
for
ygberg
was
unacquainted
with
aristotle
and
would
have
died
sooner
than
have
admitted
it
as
he
was
not
quick
at
repartee
he
failed
to
discover
the
breach
which
falk
had
left
open
but
olle
did
caught
aristotle
with
both
hands
and
flung
him
back
at
his
opponent
although
i
not
a
learned
man
i
venture
to
question
whether
you
falk
have
upset
your
opponent
argument
in
my
opinion
may
be
used
and
accepted
as
a
definition
in
a
logical
conclusion
in
spite
of
aristotle
not
having
mentioned
the
word
in
his
metaphysics
am
i
right
gentlemen
i
do
know
i
not
a
learned
man
and
falk
has
made
a
study
of
these
things
he
had
spoken
with
eyelids
now
he
closed
them
entirely
and
looked
impudently
shy
there
was
a
general
murmur
of
olle
is
right
falk
realized
that
this
was
a
matter
to
be
handled
without
mittens
if
the
honour
of
upsala
was
to
be
safeguarded
he
made
a
pass
with
the
philosophical
pack
of
cards
and
threw
up
an
ace
montanus
has
denied
the
antecedent
or
said
simply
majorem
very
well
i
on
my
part
declare
that
he
has
been
guilty
of
a
when
he
found
himself
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
he
went
astray
and
made
a
syllogism
after
instead
of
he
has
forgotten
the
golden
rule
camestres
festino
baroco
and
therefore
his
conclusion
became
weakened
am
i
right
gentlemen
quite
right
absolutely
right
replied
everybody
except
the
two
philosophers
who
had
never
held
a
book
of
logic
in
their
hands
ygberg
looked
as
if
he
had
bitten
on
a
nail
and
olle
grinned
as
if
a
handful
of
snuff
had
been
thrown
into
his
eyes
but
his
native
shrewdness
had
discovered
the
tactical
method
of
his
opponent
he
resolved
not
to
stick
to
the
point
but
to
talk
of
something
else
he
brought
out
everything
he
had
learned
and
everything
he
had
heard
beginning
with
the
criticism
of
fichte
philosophy
to
which
falk
had
been
listening
a
little
while
ago
from
behind
the
fence
the
discussion
went
on
until
the
morning
was
nearly
spent
in
the
meantime
lundell
went
on
painting
his
foul
pipe
snoring
loudly
the
model
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
broken
chair
his
head
sinking
deeper
and
deeper
until
about
noon
it
hung
between
his
knees
a
mathematician
could
have
calculated
the
time
when
it
would
reach
the
centre
of
the
earth
sellén
was
sitting
at
the
open
window
enjoying
himself
but
poor
falk
who
had
been
under
the
impression
that
this
terrible
philosophy
was
a
thing
of
the
past
was
compelled
to
continue
throwing
fistfuls
of
philosophic
snuff
into
the
eyes
of
his
antagonists
the
torture
would
never
have
come
to
an
end
if
the
model
centre
of
gravity
had
not
gradually
shifted
to
one
of
the
most
delicate
parts
of
the
chair
it
gave
way
and
the
baron
fell
on
the
floor
lundell
seized
the
opportunity
to
inveigh
against
the
vice
of
drunkenness
and
its
miserable
consequences
for
the
victim
as
well
as
for
others
by
others
he
meant
of
course
himself
falk
anxious
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
embarrassed
youth
eagerly
asked
a
question
bound
to
be
of
general
interest
where
are
the
gentlemen
going
to
dine
the
room
grew
silent
so
silent
that
the
buzzing
of
the
flies
was
plainly
audible
falk
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
he
had
stepped
on
five
corns
at
one
and
the
same
moment
it
was
lundell
who
broke
the
silence
he
and
rehnhjelm
were
going
to
dine
at
the
their
usual
restaurant
for
they
had
credit
there
sellén
objected
to
the
place
because
he
did
not
like
the
cooking
and
had
not
yet
decided
on
another
establishment
he
looked
at
the
model
with
an
anxious
inquiring
glance
ygberg
and
montanus
were
too
busy
and
not
going
to
cut
up
their
by
dressing
and
going
up
to
town
they
were
going
to
get
something
out
here
but
they
did
not
say
what
a
general
dressing
began
principally
consisting
of
a
wash
at
the
old
sellén
who
was
a
dandy
had
hidden
a
parcel
wrapped
in
a
newspaper
underneath
the
from
which
he
produced
collar
cuffs
and
made
of
paper
he
knelt
for
a
long
time
before
the
pump
gazing
into
the
trough
while
he
put
on
a
tie
a
present
from
a
lady
and
arranged
his
hair
in
a
particular
style
when
he
had
rubbed
his
shoes
with
a
bur
leaf
brushed
his
hat
with
his
coat
sleeve
put
a
in
his
buttonhole
and
seized
his
cinnamon
cane
he
was
ready
to
go
to
his
question
whether
rehnhjelm
would
be
ready
soon
lundell
replied
that
he
would
be
hours
yet
as
he
required
his
assistance
in
drawing
lundell
always
devoted
the
time
from
twelve
to
two
to
drawing
rehnhjelm
submitted
and
obeyed
although
he
found
it
hard
to
part
with
sellén
of
whom
he
was
fond
and
stay
with
lundell
whom
he
disliked
we
shall
meet
at
the
red
room
said
sellén
comforting
him
and
all
agreed
even
the
philosophers
and
the
moral
lundell
on
their
way
to
town
sellén
initiated
his
friend
falk
into
some
of
the
secrets
of
the
colonists
as
for
himself
he
had
broken
with
the
academy
because
his
views
on
art
differed
from
theirs
he
knew
that
he
had
talent
and
would
eventually
be
successful
although
success
might
be
long
in
coming
it
was
of
course
frightfully
difficult
to
make
a
name
without
the
royal
medal
there
were
also
natural
obstacles
in
his
way
he
was
a
native
of
the
barren
coast
of
halland
and
loved
grandeur
and
simplicity
but
critics
and
public
demanded
detail
and
trifles
therefore
his
pictures
did
not
sell
he
could
have
painted
what
everybody
else
painted
but
he
scorned
to
do
so
lundell
on
the
other
hand
was
a
practical
man
sellén
always
pronounced
the
word
with
a
certain
contempt
he
painted
to
please
the
public
he
never
suffered
from
indisposition
it
was
true
he
had
left
the
academy
but
for
secret
practical
reasons
moreover
in
spite
of
his
assertion
he
had
not
broken
with
it
entirely
he
made
a
good
income
out
of
his
illustrations
for
magazines
and
although
he
had
little
talent
he
was
bound
to
make
his
fortune
some
day
not
only
because
of
the
number
of
his
connexions
but
also
because
of
his
intrigues
it
was
montanus
who
had
put
him
up
to
those
he
was
the
originator
of
more
than
one
plan
which
lundell
had
successfully
carried
out
montanus
was
a
genius
although
he
was
terribly
unpractical
rehnhjelm
was
a
native
of
norrland
his
father
had
been
a
wealthy
man
he
had
owned
a
large
estate
which
was
now
the
property
of
his
former
inspector
the
old
aristocrat
was
comparatively
poor
he
hoped
that
his
son
would
learn
a
lesson
from
the
past
take
an
inspector
post
and
eventually
restore
the
family
to
its
former
position
by
the
acquisition
of
a
new
estate
buoyed
up
with
this
hope
he
had
sent
him
to
the
commercial
school
to
study
agricultural
an
accomplishment
which
the
youth
detested
he
was
a
good
fellow
but
a
little
weak
and
allowing
himself
to
be
influenced
by
lundell
who
did
not
scorn
to
take
the
fee
for
his
preaching
and
patronage
in
natura
in
the
meantime
lundell
and
the
baron
had
started
work
the
baron
was
drawing
while
the
master
lay
on
the
sofa
supervising
the
work
in
other
words
smoking
if
you
put
your
back
into
your
work
you
shall
come
to
dinner
with
me
at
the
promised
lundell
feeling
rich
with
the
two
crowns
which
he
had
saved
from
destruction
ygberg
and
montanus
had
sauntered
up
the
wooded
eminence
intending
to
sleep
away
the
dinner
hour
olle
beamed
after
his
victories
but
ygberg
was
depressed
his
pupil
had
surpassed
him
moreover
his
feet
were
cold
and
he
was
unusually
hungry
for
the
eager
discussion
of
dinner
had
awakened
in
him
slumbering
feelings
successfully
suppressed
for
the
last
twelve
months
they
threw
themselves
under
a
pine
tree
ygberg
hid
the
precious
carefully
wrapped
up
book
which
he
always
refused
to
lend
to
olle
under
his
head
and
stretched
himself
on
the
ground
he
looked
deadly
pale
cold
and
calm
like
a
corpse
which
has
abandoned
all
hope
of
resurrection
he
watched
some
little
birds
above
his
head
picking
at
the
pine
seed
and
letting
the
husks
fall
down
on
him
he
watched
a
cow
the
picture
of
robust
health
grazing
among
the
alders
he
saw
the
smoke
rising
from
the
kitchen
chimney
are
you
hungry
olle
he
asked
in
a
feeble
voice
no
replied
olle
casting
covetous
looks
at
the
wonderful
book
oh
to
be
a
cow
sighed
ygberg
crossing
his
hands
on
his
chest
and
giving
himself
up
to
sleep
when
his
low
breathing
had
become
regular
the
waking
friend
gently
pulled
the
book
from
its
without
disturbing
the
sleeper
then
he
turned
over
and
lying
on
his
stomach
he
began
to
devour
the
precious
contents
forgetting
all
about
the
and
the
chapter
iv
master
and
dogs
two
or
three
days
had
passed
charles
nicholas
falk
a
lady
of
years
of
age
had
just
finished
her
breakfast
in
bed
the
colossal
mahogany
bed
in
the
large
bedroom
it
was
only
ten
her
husband
had
been
away
since
seven
taking
up
flax
on
the
shore
but
the
young
wife
had
not
stayed
in
bed
a
thing
she
knew
to
be
contrary
to
the
rules
of
the
house
because
she
counted
on
his
absence
she
had
only
been
married
for
two
years
but
during
that
period
she
had
found
abundant
time
to
introduce
sweeping
reforms
in
the
old
conservative
household
where
everything
was
old
even
the
servants
he
had
invested
her
with
the
necessary
power
on
the
day
on
which
he
had
confessed
his
love
to
her
and
she
had
graciously
consented
to
become
his
wife
that
is
to
say
permitted
him
to
deliver
her
from
the
hated
bondage
of
her
parental
roof
where
she
had
been
compelled
to
get
up
every
morning
at
six
and
work
all
day
long
she
had
made
good
use
of
the
period
of
her
engagement
for
it
was
then
that
she
had
collected
a
number
of
guarantees
promising
her
a
free
and
independent
life
unmolested
by
any
interference
on
the
part
of
her
husband
of
course
these
guarantees
consisted
merely
of
verbal
assurances
made
by
a
man
but
she
who
had
never
allowed
her
emotion
to
get
the
better
of
her
had
carefully
noted
them
down
on
the
tablets
of
her
memory
after
two
years
of
matrimony
unredeemed
by
the
promise
of
a
child
the
husband
showed
a
decided
inclination
to
set
aside
all
these
guarantees
and
question
her
right
to
sleep
as
long
as
she
liked
for
instance
to
have
breakfast
in
bed
etcetera
etcetera
he
had
even
been
so
indelicate
as
to
remind
her
that
he
had
pulled
her
out
of
the
mire
had
delivered
her
from
a
hell
thereby
sacrificing
himself
the
marriage
had
been
a
misalliance
her
father
being
one
of
the
crew
of
the
flagship
as
she
lay
there
she
was
concocting
replies
to
these
and
similar
reproaches
and
as
her
common
sense
during
the
long
period
of
their
mutual
acquaintance
had
never
been
clouded
by
any
intoxication
of
the
senses
she
had
it
well
in
hand
and
knew
how
to
use
it
the
sounds
of
her
husband
return
filled
her
with
unalloyed
pleasure
presently
the
door
was
slammed
a
tremendous
bellowing
became
audible
she
pushed
her
head
underneath
the
to
smother
her
laughter
heavy
footsteps
crossed
the
adjacent
room
and
the
angry
husband
appeared
on
the
threshold
hat
on
head
his
wife
who
was
turning
her
back
to
him
called
out
in
her
most
dulcet
tones
is
that
you
little
lubber
come
in
come
in
the
little
lubber
this
was
a
pet
name
and
husband
and
wife
frequently
used
others
even
more
original
ones
showed
no
inclination
to
accept
her
invitation
but
remained
standing
in
the
doorway
and
shouted
why
is
the
table
laid
for
lunch
ask
the
girls
it
is
my
business
to
lay
the
table
but
customary
to
take
off
one
hat
on
coming
into
a
room
sir
what
have
you
done
with
my
cap
burnt
it
it
was
so
greasy
you
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
to
wear
it
you
burnt
it
we
talk
about
that
later
on
why
are
you
lying
in
bed
until
all
hours
of
the
morning
instead
of
supervising
the
girls
because
i
like
it
do
you
think
i
married
a
wife
to
have
her
refusing
to
look
after
her
house
what
you
did
but
why
do
you
think
i
married
you
i
told
you
a
thousand
times
so
that
i
should
have
to
work
and
you
promised
me
i
should
did
you
can
you
swear
on
your
word
of
honour
that
you
did
promise
that
the
kind
of
man
you
are
you
are
just
like
all
the
rest
it
was
long
ago
long
ago
when
was
long
ago
is
a
promise
not
binding
for
all
times
or
must
it
be
made
in
any
particular
season
the
husband
knew
this
unanswerable
logic
only
too
well
and
his
good
temper
had
the
same
effect
as
her
tears
he
gave
in
i
going
to
have
visitors
he
stated
oh
indeed
gentlemen
of
course
i
detest
women
well
i
suppose
you
ordered
what
you
want
no
i
want
you
to
do
that
i
i
no
money
for
entertaining
i
shall
certainly
not
spend
my
housekeeping
money
on
your
visitors
no
you
prefer
spending
it
on
dress
and
other
useless
things
do
you
call
the
things
i
make
for
you
useless
is
a
useless
are
slippers
useless
tell
me
tell
me
candidly
she
was
an
adept
in
formulating
her
questions
in
such
a
way
that
the
reply
was
bound
to
be
crushing
for
the
person
who
had
to
answer
them
she
was
merely
copying
her
husband
method
if
he
wanted
to
avoid
being
crushed
he
was
compelled
to
keep
changing
the
subject
of
conversation
but
i
really
have
a
very
good
reason
for
entertaining
a
few
guests
he
said
with
a
show
of
emotion
my
old
friend
fritz
levin
of
the
post
office
has
been
promoted
after
nineteen
years
service
i
read
it
in
the
postal
gazette
last
night
but
as
you
disapprove
and
as
i
always
give
way
to
you
i
shall
let
the
matter
drop
and
shall
merely
ask
levin
and
schoolmaster
nyström
to
a
little
supper
in
the
so
that
loafer
levin
has
been
promoted
i
never
perhaps
now
he
pay
you
back
all
the
money
he
owes
you
i
hope
so
i
ca
understand
how
on
earth
you
can
have
anything
to
do
with
that
man
and
the
schoolmaster
beggars
both
of
them
who
hardly
own
the
clothes
they
wear
i
say
old
girl
i
never
interfere
in
your
affairs
leave
my
business
alone
if
you
have
guests
downstairs
i
do
see
why
i
should
have
friends
up
here
well
why
do
you
all
right
little
lubber
give
me
some
money
then
the
little
lubber
in
every
respect
pleased
with
the
turn
matters
had
taken
obeyed
with
pleasure
how
much
i
very
little
cash
oh
fifty
do
are
you
mad
mad
give
me
what
i
ask
for
why
should
i
starve
when
you
feast
peace
was
established
and
the
parties
separated
with
mutual
satisfaction
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
lunch
badly
at
home
he
was
compelled
to
go
out
no
necessity
to
eat
a
poor
dinner
and
be
made
uncomfortable
by
the
presence
of
ladies
he
was
embarrassed
in
the
company
of
women
for
he
had
been
a
bachelor
too
long
no
reason
to
be
troubled
by
his
conscience
for
his
wife
would
not
be
alone
at
home
as
it
happened
she
wanted
to
invite
her
own
friends
and
be
rid
of
him
it
was
worth
fifty
crowns
as
soon
as
her
husband
had
gone
falk
rang
the
bell
she
had
stayed
in
bed
all
the
morning
to
punish
the
housemaid
for
the
girl
had
remarked
that
in
the
old
days
everybody
used
to
be
up
at
seven
she
asked
for
paper
and
ink
and
scribbled
a
note
to
homan
the
controller
wife
who
lived
in
the
house
opposite
dear
evelyn
the
letter
ran
come
in
this
evening
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
me
we
can
then
discuss
the
statutes
of
the
association
for
the
rights
of
women
possibly
a
bazaar
or
amateur
theatricals
would
help
us
on
i
am
longing
to
set
the
association
going
it
is
an
urgent
need
as
you
so
often
said
i
feel
it
very
deeply
when
i
think
about
it
do
you
think
that
her
ladyship
would
honour
my
house
at
the
same
time
perhaps
i
ought
to
call
on
her
first
come
and
fetch
me
at
twelve
and
we
have
a
cup
of
chocolate
at
a
confectioner
my
husband
is
away
yours
affectionately
eugenia
my
husband
is
away
when
she
had
despatched
the
letter
she
got
up
and
dressed
so
as
to
be
ready
at
twelve
it
was
evening
the
eastern
end
of
long
street
was
already
plunged
in
twilight
when
the
clock
of
the
german
church
struck
seven
only
a
faint
ray
of
light
from
pig
street
fell
into
falk
as
andersson
made
ready
to
close
it
for
the
night
the
shutters
in
the
had
already
been
fastened
and
the
gas
was
lighted
the
place
had
been
swept
and
straightened
two
hampers
with
protruding
necks
of
bottles
sealed
red
and
yellow
some
covered
with
tinfoil
and
others
wrapped
in
pink
tissue
paper
were
standing
close
to
the
door
the
centre
of
the
room
was
taken
up
by
a
table
covered
with
a
white
cloth
on
it
stood
an
indian
bowl
and
a
heavy
silver
candelabrum
nicholas
falk
paced
up
and
down
he
was
wearing
a
black
and
had
a
respectable
as
well
as
a
festive
air
he
had
a
right
to
look
forward
to
a
pleasant
evening
he
had
arranged
it
he
had
paid
for
it
he
was
in
his
own
house
and
at
his
ease
for
there
were
no
ladies
present
and
his
invited
guests
were
of
a
calibre
which
justified
him
in
expecting
from
them
not
only
attention
and
civility
but
a
little
more
they
were
only
two
but
he
did
not
like
many
people
they
were
his
friends
reliable
devoted
as
dogs
submissive
agreeable
always
flattering
and
never
contradicting
him
being
a
man
of
means
he
could
have
moved
in
better
circles
he
might
have
associated
with
his
father
friends
and
he
did
so
twice
a
year
but
he
was
of
too
despotic
a
nature
to
get
on
with
them
it
was
three
minutes
past
seven
and
still
the
guests
had
not
arrived
falk
began
to
show
signs
of
impatience
when
he
invited
his
henchmen
he
expected
them
to
be
punctual
to
the
minute
the
thought
of
the
unusually
sumptuous
arrangement
however
and
the
paralysing
impression
it
was
bound
to
make
helped
him
to
control
his
temper
a
little
longer
at
the
lapse
of
a
few
more
moments
fritz
levin
the
official
put
in
an
appearance
brother
oh
i
say
he
paused
in
the
action
of
divesting
himself
of
his
overcoat
and
feigned
surprise
at
the
magnificent
preparations
he
almost
seemed
in
danger
of
falling
on
his
back
with
sheer
amazement
the
and
the
tabernacle
good
lord
he
ejaculated
catching
sight
of
the
hampers
the
individual
who
delivered
these
witticisms
while
taking
off
his
overcoat
was
a
man
of
the
type
of
the
government
official
of
twenty
years
ago
his
whiskers
joined
his
moustache
his
hair
was
parted
at
the
side
and
arranged
in
a
de
he
was
extremely
pale
and
as
thin
as
a
shroud
in
spite
of
being
well
dressed
he
was
shivering
with
cold
and
seemed
to
have
secret
traffic
with
poverty
falk
manner
in
welcoming
him
was
both
rude
and
patronizing
it
was
partly
intended
to
express
his
scorn
of
flattery
more
particularly
from
an
individual
like
the
newcomer
and
partly
to
intimate
that
the
newcomer
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
his
friendship
by
way
of
congratulation
he
began
to
draw
a
parallel
between
promotion
and
his
own
father
receiving
a
commission
in
the
militia
well
it
a
grand
thing
to
have
the
royal
mandate
in
one
pocket
is
it
my
father
too
received
a
royal
mandate
pardon
me
dear
brother
but
i
only
been
appointed
appointed
or
royal
mandate
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
do
teach
me
my
father
too
had
a
royal
mandate
i
assure
you
assure
me
what
mean
by
that
mean
to
imply
that
standing
here
telling
lies
tell
me
do
you
mean
to
say
that
lying
of
course
i
do
there
no
need
to
lose
your
temper
like
that
very
well
you
admitting
that
i
not
telling
lies
consequently
you
have
a
royal
mandate
why
do
you
talk
such
nonsense
my
father
the
pale
man
in
whose
wake
a
drove
of
furies
seemed
to
have
entered
the
for
he
trembled
in
every
limb
now
rushed
at
his
patron
firmly
resolved
to
get
over
with
his
business
before
the
feast
began
so
that
nothing
should
afterwards
disturb
the
general
enjoyment
help
me
he
groaned
with
the
despair
of
a
drowning
man
taking
a
bill
out
of
his
pocket
falk
sat
down
on
the
sofa
shouted
for
andersson
ordered
him
to
open
the
bottles
and
began
to
mix
the
bowl
help
you
have
i
helped
you
before
he
replied
have
you
borrowed
from
me
again
and
again
without
paying
me
back
answer
me
what
have
you
got
to
say
i
know
brother
that
you
have
always
been
kindness
itself
to
me
and
now
you
been
promoted
have
you
everything
was
to
be
all
right
now
all
debts
were
to
be
paid
and
a
new
life
was
to
begin
listened
to
this
kind
of
talk
for
eighteen
years
what
salary
do
you
draw
now
twelve
hundred
crowns
instead
of
eight
hundred
as
before
but
now
think
of
this
the
cost
of
the
mandate
was
one
hundred
and
the
pension
fund
deducts
fifty
that
makes
one
hundred
and
where
i
am
to
take
it
from
but
the
worst
of
it
all
is
this
my
creditors
have
seized
half
my
salary
consequently
i
have
now
only
six
hundred
crowns
to
live
on
instead
of
eight
hundred
and
waited
nineteen
years
for
that
promotion
is
a
splendid
thing
why
did
you
get
into
debt
one
ought
never
to
get
into
debt
never
get
into
debt
with
a
salary
of
eight
hundred
crowns
all
these
years
how
was
it
possible
to
keep
out
of
it
in
that
case
you
had
no
business
to
be
in
the
employ
of
the
government
but
this
is
a
matter
which
does
concern
me
does
concern
me
wo
you
sign
once
more
for
the
last
time
you
know
my
principles
i
never
sign
bills
please
let
the
matter
drop
levin
who
was
evidently
used
to
these
refusals
calmed
down
at
the
same
moment
schoolmaster
nyström
entered
and
to
the
relief
of
both
parties
interrupted
the
conversation
he
was
a
individual
of
mysterious
appearance
and
age
his
occupation
too
was
mysterious
he
was
supposed
to
be
a
master
at
a
school
in
one
of
the
southern
suburbs
nobody
ever
asked
which
school
and
he
did
not
care
to
talk
about
it
his
mission
so
far
as
falk
was
concerned
was
first
to
be
addressed
as
schoolmaster
when
there
were
other
people
present
secondly
to
be
polite
and
submissive
thirdly
to
borrow
a
little
every
now
and
then
never
exceeding
a
fiver
it
was
one
of
fundamental
needs
that
people
should
borrow
money
from
him
occasionally
only
a
little
of
course
and
fourthly
to
write
verses
on
festive
occasions
and
the
latter
was
not
the
least
of
the
component
parts
of
his
mission
charles
nicholas
falk
sat
enthroned
on
his
leather
sofa
very
conscious
of
the
fact
that
it
was
leather
sofa
surrounded
by
his
staff
or
his
dogs
as
one
might
have
said
levin
found
everything
splendid
the
bowl
the
glasses
the
ladle
the
cigars
the
whole
box
had
been
taken
from
the
mantelpiece
the
matches
the
the
bottles
the
corks
the
wire
everything
the
schoolmaster
looked
content
he
was
not
called
upon
to
talk
the
other
two
did
that
he
was
merely
required
to
be
present
as
a
witness
in
case
of
need
falk
was
the
first
to
raise
his
glass
and
drink
nobody
knew
to
whom
but
the
schoolmaster
believing
it
to
be
to
the
hero
of
the
day
produced
his
verses
and
began
to
read
to
fritz
levin
on
the
day
of
his
promotion
falk
was
attacked
by
a
violent
cough
which
disturbed
the
reading
and
spoiled
the
effect
of
the
wittiest
points
but
nyström
who
was
a
shrewd
man
and
had
foreseen
this
had
introduced
into
his
poem
the
finely
felt
and
finely
expressed
reflection
what
would
have
become
of
fritz
levin
if
charles
nicholas
had
befriended
him
this
subtle
hint
at
the
numerous
loans
made
by
falk
to
his
friend
soothed
the
cough
it
subsided
and
ensured
a
better
reception
to
the
last
verse
which
was
quite
impudently
dedicated
to
levin
a
tactlessness
which
again
threatened
to
disturb
the
harmony
falk
emptied
his
glass
as
if
he
were
draining
a
cup
filled
to
the
brim
with
ingratitude
you
not
up
to
the
mark
nyström
he
said
no
he
was
far
wittier
on
your
birthday
agreed
levin
guessing
what
falk
was
driving
at
falk
glance
penetrated
into
the
most
hidden
recesses
of
levin
soul
trying
to
discover
whether
any
lie
or
fraud
lay
hidden
there
and
as
his
eyes
were
blinded
by
pride
he
saw
nothing
quite
true
he
acquiesced
i
never
heard
anything
more
witty
in
all
my
life
it
was
good
enough
to
be
printed
you
really
ought
to
get
your
things
printed
i
say
nyström
surely
you
know
it
by
heart
you
nyström
had
a
shocking
memory
or
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
not
yet
had
enough
wine
to
commit
the
suggested
outrage
against
decency
and
good
form
he
asked
for
time
but
falk
irritated
by
his
quiet
resistance
had
gone
too
far
to
turn
back
and
insisted
on
his
request
he
was
almost
sure
that
he
had
a
copy
of
the
verses
with
him
he
searched
his
and
behold
there
they
lay
modesty
did
not
forbid
him
to
read
them
aloud
himself
it
would
not
have
been
for
the
first
time
but
it
sounded
better
for
another
to
read
them
the
poor
dog
bit
his
chain
but
it
held
he
was
a
sensitive
man
this
schoolmaster
but
he
had
to
be
brutal
if
he
did
not
want
to
relinquish
the
precious
gift
of
life
and
he
had
been
very
brutal
the
most
private
affairs
were
fully
and
openly
discussed
everything
in
connexion
with
the
birth
of
the
hero
his
reception
into
the
community
his
education
and
were
made
fun
of
the
verses
would
have
disgusted
even
falk
himself
if
they
had
treated
of
any
other
person
but
the
fact
of
their
celebrating
him
and
his
doings
made
them
excellent
when
the
recitation
was
over
his
health
was
drunk
uproariously
in
many
glasses
for
each
member
of
the
little
party
felt
that
he
was
too
sober
to
keep
his
real
feelings
under
control
the
table
was
now
cleared
and
an
excellent
supper
consisting
of
oysters
birds
and
other
good
things
was
served
falk
went
sniffing
from
dish
to
dish
sent
one
or
two
of
them
back
took
care
that
the
chill
was
taken
off
the
stout
and
that
the
wines
were
the
right
temperature
now
his
dogs
were
called
upon
to
do
their
work
and
offer
him
a
pleasant
spectacle
when
everybody
was
ready
he
pulled
out
his
gold
watch
and
held
it
in
his
hand
while
he
jestingly
asked
a
question
which
his
convives
had
heard
many
times
so
very
many
times
what
is
the
time
by
the
silver
watches
of
the
gentlemen
the
anticipated
reply
came
as
in
duty
bound
accompanied
by
gay
laughter
the
watches
were
at
the
this
put
falk
into
the
best
of
tempers
which
found
expression
in
the
not
at
all
unexpected
joke
the
animals
will
be
fed
at
eight
he
sat
down
poured
out
three
liqueurs
took
one
and
invited
his
friends
to
follow
his
example
i
must
make
a
beginning
myself
as
you
both
seem
to
be
holding
back
do
let
stand
on
ceremony
tuck
in
boys
the
feeding
began
charles
nicholas
who
was
not
particularly
hungry
had
plenty
of
time
to
enjoy
the
appetite
of
his
guests
and
he
continually
urged
them
to
eat
an
unspeakably
benevolent
smile
radiated
from
his
bright
sunny
countenance
as
he
watched
their
zeal
and
it
was
difficult
to
say
what
he
enjoyed
more
the
fact
of
their
having
a
good
meal
or
the
fact
of
their
being
so
hungry
he
sat
there
like
a
coachman
on
his
box
clicking
his
tongue
and
cracking
his
whip
at
them
eat
nyström
you
do
know
when
you
get
a
meal
next
help
yourself
levin
you
look
as
if
you
could
do
with
a
little
flesh
on
your
bones
are
you
grinning
at
the
oysters
are
they
good
enough
for
a
fellow
like
you
what
do
you
say
take
another
do
be
shy
what
do
you
say
you
had
enough
nonsense
have
a
drink
now
take
some
stout
boys
now
a
little
more
salmon
you
take
another
piece
by
the
lord
harry
you
shall
go
on
eating
why
the
devil
you
it
costs
you
nothing
when
the
birds
had
been
carved
charles
nicholas
poured
out
the
claret
with
a
certain
solemnity
the
guests
paused
anticipating
a
speech
the
host
raised
his
glass
smelt
the
bouquet
of
the
wine
and
said
with
profound
gravity
your
health
you
hogs
nyström
responded
by
raising
his
glass
and
drinking
but
levin
left
his
untouched
looking
as
if
he
were
secretly
sharpening
a
knife
when
supper
was
over
levin
strengthened
by
food
and
drink
his
senses
befogged
by
the
fumes
of
the
wine
began
to
nurse
a
feeling
of
independence
a
strong
yearning
for
freedom
stirred
in
his
heart
his
voice
grew
more
resonant
he
pronounced
his
words
with
increasing
assurance
and
his
movements
betrayed
greater
ease
give
me
a
cigar
he
said
in
a
commanding
tone
no
not
a
weed
like
these
a
good
one
charles
nicholas
regarding
his
words
as
a
good
joke
obeyed
your
brother
is
here
remarked
levin
casually
there
was
something
ominous
and
threatening
in
his
voice
falk
felt
it
and
became
uneasy
no
he
said
shortly
but
his
voice
was
unsteady
levin
waited
for
a
few
moments
before
striking
a
second
blow
one
of
his
most
lucrative
occupations
was
his
interference
in
other
business
he
carried
gossip
from
family
to
family
sowed
a
grain
of
discord
here
and
another
there
merely
to
play
the
grateful
part
of
the
mediator
afterwards
in
this
way
he
had
obtained
a
great
deal
of
influence
was
feared
by
his
acquaintances
and
managed
them
as
if
they
were
marionettes
falk
felt
this
disagreeable
influence
and
attempted
to
shake
it
off
but
in
vain
levin
knew
how
to
whet
his
curiosity
and
by
hinting
at
more
than
he
knew
he
succeeded
in
bluffing
people
into
betraying
their
secrets
at
the
present
moment
levin
held
the
whip
and
he
promised
himself
to
make
his
oppressor
feel
it
he
was
still
merely
playing
with
it
but
falk
was
waiting
for
the
blow
he
tried
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation
he
urged
his
friends
to
drink
and
they
drank
levin
grew
whiter
and
colder
as
his
intoxication
increased
and
went
on
playing
with
his
victim
your
wife
has
visitors
this
evening
he
suddenly
remarked
how
do
you
know
asked
falk
taken
aback
i
know
everything
answered
levin
showing
his
teeth
it
was
almost
true
his
widely
extending
business
connexions
compelled
him
to
visit
as
many
public
places
as
possible
and
there
he
heard
much
not
only
the
things
which
were
spoken
of
in
his
society
but
also
those
which
were
discussed
by
others
falk
was
beginning
to
feel
afraid
without
knowing
why
and
he
thought
it
best
to
divert
the
threatening
danger
he
became
civil
humble
even
but
levin
boldness
still
increased
there
was
no
alternative
he
must
make
a
speech
remind
his
companions
of
the
cause
of
the
gathering
acknowledge
the
hero
of
the
day
there
was
no
other
escape
he
was
a
poor
speaker
but
the
thing
had
to
be
done
he
tapped
against
the
bowl
filled
the
glasses
and
recollecting
an
old
speech
made
by
his
father
when
falk
became
his
own
master
he
rose
and
began
very
slowly
gentlemen
i
have
been
my
own
master
these
eight
years
i
was
only
thirty
years
old
the
change
from
a
sitting
position
to
a
standing
one
caused
a
rush
of
blood
to
his
head
he
became
confused
levin
mocking
glances
added
to
his
embarrassment
his
confusion
grew
the
figure
thirty
seemed
something
so
colossal
that
it
completely
disconcerted
him
did
i
say
thirty
i
did
mean
it
i
was
in
my
father
employ
for
many
years
it
would
take
too
long
to
recount
everything
i
suffered
during
those
years
it
the
common
lot
perhaps
you
think
me
selfish
hear
hear
groaned
nyström
who
was
resting
his
heavy
head
on
the
table
levin
puffed
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
in
the
direction
of
the
speaker
as
if
he
were
spitting
in
his
face
falk
really
intoxicated
now
continued
his
speech
his
eyes
seemed
to
seek
a
distant
goal
without
being
able
to
find
it
everybody
is
selfish
we
all
know
that
my
father
who
made
a
speech
when
i
became
my
own
master
as
i
was
just
saying
he
pulled
out
his
gold
watch
and
took
it
off
the
chain
the
two
listeners
opened
their
eyes
wide
was
he
going
to
make
a
present
of
it
to
levin
handed
me
on
that
occasion
this
gold
watch
which
he
in
his
turn
had
received
from
his
father
in
the
year
again
those
dreadful
figures
he
must
refer
back
this
gold
watch
gentlemen
was
presented
to
me
and
i
can
not
think
without
emotion
of
the
moment
when
i
received
it
perhaps
you
think
i
selfish
gentlemen
i
not
i
know
it
not
good
form
to
speak
of
oneself
but
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
it
seems
very
natural
to
glance
at
the
past
i
only
want
to
mention
one
little
incident
he
had
forgotten
levin
and
the
significance
of
the
day
and
was
under
the
impression
that
he
was
celebrating
the
close
of
his
all
of
a
sudden
he
remembered
the
scene
between
himself
and
his
brother
and
his
triumph
he
felt
a
pressing
need
to
talk
of
this
triumph
but
he
could
not
remember
the
details
he
merely
remembered
having
proved
that
his
brother
was
a
blackguard
he
had
forgotten
the
chain
of
evidence
with
the
exception
of
only
two
facts
his
brother
and
a
blackguard
he
tried
to
link
them
together
but
they
always
fell
apart
his
brain
worked
incessantly
and
picture
followed
on
picture
he
must
tell
them
of
a
generous
action
he
had
done
he
recollected
that
he
had
given
his
wife
some
money
in
the
morning
and
had
allowed
her
to
sleep
as
long
as
she
liked
and
have
breakfast
in
bed
but
that
a
suitable
subject
he
was
in
an
unpleasant
position
but
fear
of
a
silence
and
the
two
pairs
of
sharp
eyes
which
followed
his
every
movement
helped
him
to
pull
himself
together
he
realized
that
he
was
still
standing
watch
in
hand
the
watch
how
had
it
got
into
his
hand
why
were
his
friends
sitting
down
almost
blotted
out
by
the
smoke
while
he
was
on
his
legs
oh
of
course
he
had
been
telling
them
about
the
watch
and
they
were
waiting
for
the
continuation
of
the
story
this
watch
gentlemen
is
nothing
special
at
all
it
only
french
gold
the
two
whilom
owners
of
silver
watches
opened
their
eyes
wide
this
information
was
new
to
them
and
i
believe
it
has
only
seven
rubies
it
not
a
good
watch
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
should
rather
call
it
a
cheap
one
some
secret
cause
of
which
his
brain
was
hardly
conscious
made
him
angry
he
must
vent
his
wrath
on
something
tapping
the
table
with
his
watch
he
shouted
it
a
damned
bad
watch
i
say
listen
to
me
when
i
speaking
you
believe
what
i
say
fritz
answer
me
why
do
you
look
so
vicious
you
do
believe
me
i
can
read
it
in
your
eyes
fritz
you
believe
what
i
saying
believe
me
i
know
human
nature
and
i
might
stand
security
for
you
once
more
either
you
are
a
liar
or
i
am
shall
i
prove
to
you
that
you
are
a
scoundrel
shall
i
listen
nyström
if
i
forge
a
bill
am
i
a
scoundrel
of
course
you
are
a
scoundrel
the
devil
take
you
answered
nyström
without
a
moment
hesitation
yes
yes
his
efforts
to
remember
whether
levin
had
forged
a
bill
or
was
in
any
way
connected
with
a
bill
were
in
vain
therefore
he
was
obliged
to
let
the
matter
drop
levin
was
tired
he
was
also
afraid
that
his
victim
might
lose
consciousness
and
that
he
and
nyström
would
be
robbed
of
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
his
intended
discomfiture
he
therefore
interrupted
falk
with
a
jest
in
his
host
own
style
your
health
old
rascal
and
down
came
the
whip
he
produced
a
newspaper
have
you
seen
the
he
asked
falk
in
cold
murderous
accents
falk
stared
at
the
scandalous
paper
but
said
nothing
the
inevitable
was
bound
to
happen
it
contains
a
splendid
article
on
the
board
of
payment
of
salaries
falk
cheeks
grew
white
rumour
has
it
that
your
brother
wrote
it
it
a
lie
my
brother
no
he
is
hear
but
unfortunately
he
had
to
suffer
for
it
i
told
he
been
sacked
it
a
lie
i
afraid
it
true
moreover
i
saw
him
dining
at
the
with
a
rascally
looking
chap
i
sorry
for
the
lad
it
was
the
worst
blow
that
could
have
befallen
charles
nicholas
he
was
disgraced
his
name
his
father
name
was
dishonoured
all
that
the
old
burgesses
had
achieved
had
been
in
vain
if
he
had
been
told
that
his
wife
had
died
he
could
have
borne
up
under
it
a
financial
loss
too
might
have
been
repaired
if
he
had
been
told
that
his
friend
levin
or
nyström
had
been
arrested
for
forgery
he
would
have
disowned
them
for
he
had
never
shown
himself
in
public
in
their
company
but
he
could
not
deny
his
relationship
to
his
brother
and
his
brother
had
disgraced
him
there
was
no
getting
away
from
the
fact
levin
had
found
a
certain
pleasure
in
retailing
his
information
falk
although
he
had
never
given
his
brother
the
smallest
encouragement
was
in
the
habit
of
boasting
of
him
and
his
achievements
to
his
friends
my
brother
the
assessor
is
a
man
of
brains
and
he
go
far
mark
my
words
these
continual
indirect
reproaches
had
long
been
a
source
of
irritation
to
levin
more
particularly
as
charles
nicholas
drew
a
definite
unsurpassable
although
indefinable
line
between
assessors
and
secretaries
levin
without
moving
a
finger
in
the
matter
had
had
his
revenge
at
so
little
cost
to
himself
that
he
could
afford
to
be
generous
and
play
the
part
of
the
comforter
there
no
reason
why
you
should
take
it
so
much
to
heart
even
a
journalist
can
be
a
decent
specimen
of
humanity
and
you
exaggerate
the
scandal
there
can
be
no
scandal
where
no
definite
individuals
have
been
attacked
moreover
the
whole
thing
very
witty
and
reading
it
this
last
pill
of
comfort
made
falk
furious
he
robbed
me
of
my
good
name
my
name
how
can
i
show
myself
at
the
exchange
what
will
people
say
by
people
he
meant
his
wife
she
would
enjoy
the
situation
because
it
would
make
the
misalliance
less
marked
henceforth
they
would
be
on
the
same
social
level
the
thought
was
intolerable
a
bitter
hatred
for
all
mankind
took
possession
of
his
soul
if
only
he
had
been
the
father
then
he
could
have
made
use
of
his
parental
privilege
washed
his
hands
of
him
cursed
him
and
so
have
put
an
end
to
the
matter
but
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
brotherly
privilege
was
it
possible
that
he
himself
was
partly
to
blame
for
the
disgrace
had
he
not
forced
his
brother
into
his
profession
maybe
the
scene
of
the
morning
or
his
brother
financial
difficulties
caused
by
him
were
to
blame
no
he
had
never
committed
a
base
action
he
was
blameless
he
was
respected
and
looked
up
to
he
was
no
he
had
never
been
sacked
by
anybody
did
he
not
carry
a
paper
in
his
testifying
that
he
was
the
kindest
friend
with
the
kindest
heart
had
not
the
schoolmaster
read
it
aloud
a
little
while
ago
yes
certainly
and
he
sat
down
to
drink
drink
immoderately
not
to
stupefy
his
conscience
there
was
no
necessity
for
that
he
had
done
no
wrong
but
merely
to
drown
his
anger
but
it
was
no
use
it
boiled
over
and
scalded
those
who
sat
nearest
to
him
drink
you
rascals
that
brute
there
asleep
and
you
call
yourselves
friends
waken
him
up
levin
whom
are
you
shouting
at
asked
the
offended
levin
peevishly
at
you
of
course
two
glances
were
exchanged
across
the
table
which
promised
no
good
falk
whose
temper
improved
directly
he
saw
another
man
in
a
rage
poured
a
ladleful
of
the
contents
of
the
bowl
on
the
head
so
that
it
trickled
down
his
neck
behind
his
collar
do
dare
to
do
that
again
threatened
levin
who
to
prevent
me
i
yes
i
i
sha
let
you
ruin
his
clothes
it
a
beastly
shame
his
clothes
laughed
falk
is
it
my
coat
did
i
give
it
to
him
you
going
too
far
said
levin
rising
to
go
so
you
going
now
you
had
enough
to
eat
you
ca
drink
any
more
you
do
want
me
any
longer
did
you
want
to
borrow
a
fiver
what
am
i
to
be
deprived
of
the
honour
of
lending
you
some
money
did
you
want
me
to
sign
something
sign
eh
at
the
word
sign
levin
pricked
up
his
ears
supposing
he
tried
to
get
the
better
of
him
in
his
excited
condition
the
thought
softened
him
do
be
unjust
brother
he
i
not
ungrateful
i
fully
appreciate
your
kindness
but
i
poor
poorer
than
you
ever
been
or
ever
can
be
i
suffered
humiliations
which
you
ca
even
conceive
but
i
always
looked
upon
you
as
a
friend
i
mean
a
friend
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
you
had
too
much
to
drink
and
so
you
cross
this
makes
you
unjust
but
i
assure
you
gentlemen
in
the
whole
world
there
beats
no
kinder
heart
than
that
of
charles
nicholas
and
i
do
say
this
for
the
first
time
i
thank
you
for
your
courtesy
that
is
to
say
if
the
excellent
supper
we
have
eaten
the
magnificent
wines
we
have
drunk
have
been
eaten
and
drunk
in
my
honour
i
thank
you
brother
and
drink
your
health
to
you
brother
charles
nicholas
thank
you
thank
you
a
thousand
times
you
not
done
it
in
vain
mark
my
words
strange
to
say
these
words
spoken
in
a
tremulous
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
produced
good
results
falk
felt
good
had
he
again
been
assured
that
he
had
a
kind
heart
he
firmly
believed
it
the
intoxication
had
reached
the
sentimental
stage
they
moved
nearer
together
they
talked
of
their
good
qualities
of
the
wickedness
of
the
world
the
warmth
of
their
feelings
the
strength
of
their
good
intentions
they
grasped
each
other
hands
falk
spoke
of
his
wife
of
his
kindness
to
her
he
regretted
the
lack
of
spirituality
in
his
calling
he
mentioned
how
painfully
aware
he
was
of
his
want
of
culture
he
said
that
his
life
was
a
failure
and
after
the
consumption
of
his
tenth
liqueur
he
confided
to
levin
that
it
had
been
his
ambition
to
go
into
the
church
become
a
missionary
even
they
grew
more
and
more
spiritual
levin
spoke
of
his
dead
mother
her
death
and
funeral
of
an
unhappy
and
finally
of
his
religious
convictions
as
a
rule
jealously
guarded
as
a
secret
and
soon
they
were
launched
on
an
eager
discussion
of
religion
it
struck
one
it
struck
two
and
they
were
still
talking
while
nyström
slept
soundly
his
arms
on
the
table
and
his
head
resting
on
his
arms
a
dense
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
filled
the
and
robbed
the
gas
flames
of
their
brilliancy
the
seven
candles
of
the
candelabrum
had
burnt
down
to
the
sockets
and
the
table
presented
a
dismal
sight
one
or
two
glasses
had
lost
their
stems
the
stained
tablecloth
was
covered
with
cigar
ash
the
floor
was
strewn
with
matches
the
daylight
was
breaking
through
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
its
shafts
pierced
the
cloud
of
smoke
and
drew
cabbalistic
figures
on
the
tablecloth
between
the
two
champions
of
their
faith
busily
engaged
in
the
augsburg
confession
they
were
now
talking
with
hissing
voices
their
brains
were
numbed
their
words
sounded
dry
the
tension
was
relaxing
in
spite
of
their
diligent
recourse
to
the
bottle
they
tried
to
whip
up
their
souls
into
an
ecstasy
but
their
efforts
grew
weaker
and
weaker
the
spirit
had
died
out
of
their
conversation
they
only
exchanged
meaningless
words
the
stupefied
brains
which
had
been
whirling
round
like
teetotums
slackened
in
their
speed
and
finally
stopped
one
thought
alone
filled
their
minds
they
must
go
to
bed
if
they
did
not
want
to
loathe
the
sight
of
each
other
they
must
be
alone
nyström
was
shaken
into
consciousness
levin
embraced
charles
nicholas
and
took
the
opportunity
to
pocket
three
of
his
cigars
the
heights
which
they
had
scaled
were
too
sublime
to
allow
them
to
talk
of
the
bill
just
yet
they
parted
the
host
let
his
guests
out
he
was
alone
he
opened
the
shutters
daylight
poured
into
the
room
he
opened
the
window
the
cool
swept
through
the
narrow
street
one
side
of
which
was
already
illuminated
by
the
rising
sun
it
struck
four
he
listened
to
that
wonderful
striking
only
heard
by
the
poor
wretch
who
yearns
for
the
day
on
a
bed
of
sickness
or
sorrow
even
long
street
east
that
street
of
vice
of
filth
and
brawls
lay
in
the
early
morning
sun
still
desolate
and
pure
falk
felt
deeply
unhappy
he
was
disgraced
he
was
lonely
he
closed
window
and
shutters
and
as
he
turned
round
and
beheld
the
state
of
the
room
he
at
once
began
setting
it
straight
he
picked
up
the
cigar
ends
and
threw
them
into
the
grate
he
cleared
the
table
swept
the
room
dusted
it
and
put
everything
in
its
place
he
washed
his
face
and
hands
and
brushed
his
hair
a
policeman
might
have
thought
him
a
murderer
intent
on
effacing
all
traces
of
his
crime
but
all
the
while
he
thought
clearly
firmly
and
logically
when
he
had
straightened
the
room
and
himself
he
formed
a
resolution
long
brooded
over
but
now
to
be
carried
into
effect
he
would
wipe
away
the
disgrace
which
had
fallen
on
his
family
he
would
rise
in
the
world
and
become
a
and
influential
man
he
would
begin
a
new
life
he
would
keep
his
reputation
unstained
and
he
would
make
his
name
respected
he
felt
that
only
a
great
ambition
could
help
him
to
keep
his
head
erect
after
the
blow
he
had
received
ambition
had
been
latent
in
his
heart
it
had
been
awakened
and
henceforth
it
should
rule
his
life
quite
sober
now
he
lighted
a
cigar
drank
a
brandy
and
went
upstairs
quietly
gently
so
as
not
to
disturb
his
sleeping
wife
chapter
v
at
the
arvid
falk
decided
to
try
smith
first
the
almighty
smith
a
name
adopted
by
the
publisher
in
his
youth
during
a
short
trip
to
the
great
continent
from
exaggerated
admiration
of
everything
american
the
redoubtable
smith
with
his
thousand
arms
who
could
a
writer
in
twelve
months
however
bad
the
original
material
his
method
was
well
known
though
none
but
he
dared
to
make
use
of
it
for
it
required
an
unparalleled
amount
of
impudence
the
writer
whom
he
took
up
could
be
sure
of
making
a
name
hence
smith
was
overrun
with
nameless
writers
the
following
story
is
told
as
an
instance
of
his
irresistible
power
and
capacity
for
starting
an
author
on
the
road
to
fame
a
young
inexperienced
writer
submitted
his
first
novel
a
bad
one
to
smith
for
some
reason
the
latter
happened
to
like
the
first
chapter
he
never
read
more
and
decided
to
bless
the
world
with
a
new
author
the
book
was
published
bearing
on
the
back
of
the
cover
the
words
blood
and
sword
a
novel
by
gustav
sjöholm
this
work
of
the
young
and
promising
author
whose
highly
respected
name
has
for
a
long
time
been
familiar
to
the
widest
circles
etc
etc
it
is
a
book
which
we
can
strongly
recommend
to
the
public
the
book
was
published
on
april
on
april
a
review
appeared
in
the
widely
read
metropolitan
paper
the
in
which
smith
held
fifty
shares
it
concluded
by
saying
gustav
sjöholm
name
is
already
well
known
the
spreading
of
his
fame
does
not
lie
with
us
and
we
recommend
this
book
not
only
to
the
but
also
to
the
public
on
april
an
advertisement
appeared
in
every
paper
of
the
capital
with
the
following
quotation
gustav
sjöholm
name
is
already
well
known
the
spreading
of
his
fame
does
not
lie
with
us
on
the
same
evening
a
notice
appeared
in
the
a
paper
read
by
nobody
it
represented
the
book
as
a
model
of
bad
literature
and
the
reviewer
swore
that
gustav
sjöblom
reviewer
intentional
slip
had
no
name
at
all
but
as
nobody
read
the
the
opposition
remained
unheard
the
other
papers
unwilling
to
disagree
with
the
venerable
leading
and
afraid
of
offending
smith
were
mild
in
their
criticisms
but
no
more
they
held
the
view
that
with
hard
work
gustav
sjöholm
might
make
a
name
for
himself
in
the
future
a
few
days
of
silence
followed
but
in
every
paper
in
the
in
bold
type
appeared
the
advertisement
shouting
gustav
sjöholm
name
is
already
well
known
then
a
correspondence
was
started
in
the
reproaching
the
metropolitan
papers
with
being
hard
on
young
authors
gustav
sjöholm
is
simply
a
genius
affirmed
the
correspondent
in
spite
of
all
that
dogmatic
blockheads
might
say
to
the
contrary
on
the
next
day
the
advertisement
again
appeared
in
all
the
papers
bawling
gustav
sjöholm
name
is
already
well
known
etc
gustav
sjöholm
is
a
genius
etc
the
cover
of
the
next
number
of
the
magazine
one
of
publications
bore
the
notice
we
are
pleased
to
be
in
a
position
to
inform
our
numerous
subscribers
that
the
brilliant
young
author
gustav
sjöholm
has
promised
us
an
original
novel
for
our
next
number
etc
and
then
again
the
advertisement
in
the
papers
finally
when
at
christmas
the
almanac
appeared
the
authors
mentioned
on
the
title
page
were
orvar
odd
talis
qualis
gustav
sjöholm
and
others
it
was
a
fact
in
the
eighth
month
gustav
sjöholm
was
made
and
the
public
was
powerless
it
had
to
swallow
him
it
was
impossible
to
go
into
a
bookseller
and
look
at
a
book
without
reading
his
name
impossible
to
take
up
a
newspaper
without
coming
across
it
in
all
circumstances
and
conditions
of
life
that
name
obtruded
itself
printed
on
a
slip
of
paper
it
was
put
into
the
housewives
market
baskets
on
saturdays
the
servants
carried
it
home
from
the
tradespeople
the
swept
it
off
the
street
and
the
man
of
leisure
went
about
with
it
in
the
pockets
of
his
being
well
aware
of
smith
great
power
the
young
man
climbed
the
dark
stairs
of
the
publisher
house
close
to
the
great
church
not
without
misgivings
he
had
to
wait
for
a
long
time
in
an
outer
office
a
prey
to
the
most
unpleasant
meditations
until
suddenly
the
door
was
burst
open
and
a
young
man
rushed
out
of
an
inner
office
despair
on
his
face
and
a
roll
of
paper
under
his
arm
shaking
in
every
limb
falk
entered
the
sanctum
where
the
despot
received
his
visitors
seated
on
a
low
sofa
calm
and
serene
as
a
god
he
kindly
nodded
his
grey
head
covered
by
a
blue
cap
and
went
on
smoking
peacefully
as
if
he
had
never
shattered
a
man
hopes
or
turned
an
unhappy
wretch
from
his
door
good
morning
sir
good
morning
his
divinely
flashing
eyes
glanced
at
the
newcomer
clothes
and
approved
nevertheless
he
did
not
ask
him
to
sit
down
my
name
is
falk
unknown
to
me
what
is
your
father
my
father
is
dead
is
he
good
what
can
i
do
for
you
sir
falk
produced
a
manuscript
from
his
breast
pocket
and
handed
it
to
smith
the
latter
sat
on
it
without
looking
at
it
you
want
me
to
publish
it
verse
i
might
have
guessed
it
do
you
know
the
cost
of
printing
a
single
page
sir
no
you
do
and
he
playfully
poked
the
ignoramus
with
the
stem
of
his
pipe
have
you
made
a
name
sir
no
have
you
distinguished
yourself
in
any
way
no
the
academy
has
praised
these
verses
which
academy
the
academy
of
sciences
the
one
which
publishes
all
that
stuff
about
flints
about
flints
yes
you
know
the
academy
of
sciences
close
to
the
museum
near
the
river
well
then
oh
no
smith
the
swedish
academy
in
the
exchange
i
see
the
one
with
the
tallow
candles
never
mind
no
man
on
earth
can
tell
what
purpose
it
serves
no
my
dear
sir
the
essential
thing
is
to
have
a
name
a
name
like
tegnér
like
ohrenschlägel
like
yes
our
country
has
many
great
poets
but
i
ca
remember
them
just
at
the
moment
but
a
name
is
necessary
falk
h
who
knows
falk
i
do
and
i
know
many
great
poets
as
i
recently
said
to
my
friend
ibsen
just
you
listen
to
me
ibsen
i
call
him
ibsen
quite
plainly
you
listen
to
me
write
something
for
my
magazine
pay
you
whatever
you
ask
he
wrote
i
paid
but
i
got
my
money
back
the
annihilated
young
man
longed
to
sink
through
the
chinks
in
the
floor
when
he
realized
that
he
was
standing
before
a
person
who
called
ibsen
quite
plainly
ibsen
he
longed
to
recover
his
manuscript
and
go
his
way
as
the
other
young
man
had
done
away
far
away
until
he
came
to
running
water
smith
guessed
it
well
i
no
doubt
you
can
write
swedish
sir
and
you
know
our
literature
better
than
i
do
good
i
have
an
idea
i
am
told
of
great
beautiful
spiritual
writers
who
lived
in
the
past
let
say
in
the
reign
of
gustav
eriksson
and
his
daughter
christina
is
that
so
gustavus
adolfus
gustavus
adolfus
so
be
it
i
remember
there
was
one
with
a
great
a
very
great
name
he
wrote
a
fine
work
in
verse
on
god
creation
i
believe
his
christian
name
was
hokan
you
mean
haquin
spegel
smith
works
and
rest
ah
yes
well
i
been
thinking
of
publishing
it
our
nation
is
yearning
for
religion
these
days
i
noticed
that
and
one
must
give
the
people
something
i
have
given
them
a
good
deal
of
hermann
francke
and
arndt
but
the
great
foundation
can
sell
more
cheaply
than
i
can
and
now
i
want
to
bring
out
something
good
at
a
fair
price
will
you
take
the
matter
in
hand
i
do
know
where
i
come
in
as
it
is
but
a
question
of
a
reprint
answered
falk
not
daring
to
refuse
straight
out
dear
me
what
ignorance
you
would
do
the
editing
and
of
course
are
we
agreed
you
publish
it
sir
what
shall
we
draw
up
a
little
agreement
the
work
must
appear
in
numbers
what
a
little
agreement
just
hand
me
pen
and
ink
well
falk
obeyed
he
was
unable
to
offer
resistance
smith
wrote
and
falk
signed
well
so
much
for
that
now
there
another
thing
give
me
that
little
book
on
the
stand
the
third
shelf
there
now
look
here
a
brochure
title
the
guardian
angel
look
at
the
vignette
an
angel
with
an
anchor
and
a
ship
it
a
schooner
without
any
yards
i
believe
the
splendid
influence
of
marine
insurance
on
social
life
in
general
is
well
known
everybody
has
at
one
time
or
other
sent
something
more
or
less
valuable
across
the
sea
in
a
ship
what
well
everybody
does
realize
this
no
consequently
it
is
our
duty
to
enlighten
those
who
are
ignorant
is
that
so
well
we
know
you
and
i
therefore
it
is
for
us
to
enlighten
those
who
do
this
book
maintains
that
everybody
who
sends
things
across
the
water
should
insure
them
but
this
book
is
badly
written
well
we
write
a
better
one
what
you
write
me
a
novel
of
ten
pages
for
my
magazine
and
i
expect
you
to
have
sufficient
gumption
to
introduce
the
name
which
is
the
name
of
a
new
limited
liability
company
founded
by
my
nephew
and
we
are
told
to
help
our
neighbours
twice
neither
more
nor
less
but
it
must
be
done
cleverly
and
so
that
it
is
not
at
all
obvious
do
you
follow
me
falk
found
the
offer
repulsive
although
it
contained
nothing
dishonest
however
it
gave
him
a
start
with
the
influential
man
straight
away
without
any
effort
on
his
part
he
thanked
smith
and
accepted
you
know
the
size
sixteen
inches
to
the
page
altogether
a
hundred
and
sixty
inches
of
eight
lines
each
shall
we
write
a
little
agreement
smith
drew
up
an
agreement
and
falk
signed
well
now
you
know
the
history
of
sweden
go
to
the
stand
again
you
will
find
a
cliché
there
a
wood
block
to
the
right
that
it
can
you
tell
me
who
the
lady
is
meant
for
she
is
supposed
to
be
a
queen
falk
who
saw
nothing
at
first
but
a
piece
of
black
wood
finally
made
out
some
human
features
and
declared
that
to
the
best
of
his
belief
it
represented
ulrica
eleonora
did
i
say
so
hihihi
the
block
has
been
used
for
elizabeth
queen
of
england
in
an
american
popular
edition
i
bought
it
cheaply
with
a
lot
of
others
i
going
to
use
it
for
ulrica
eleonora
in
my
our
people
are
splendid
they
are
so
ready
to
buy
my
books
will
you
write
the
letterpress
although
falk
did
not
like
the
order
his
conscience
could
find
no
wrong
in
the
proposal
well
then
we
better
make
out
a
little
agreement
sixteen
pages
octavo
at
three
inches
at
lines
each
there
falk
realizing
that
the
audience
was
over
made
a
movement
to
recover
his
manuscript
on
which
smith
had
all
along
been
sitting
but
the
latter
would
not
give
it
up
he
declared
that
he
would
read
it
although
it
might
take
him
some
time
you
a
sensible
man
sir
who
knows
the
value
of
time
he
said
i
had
a
young
fellow
here
just
before
you
came
in
he
also
brought
me
verses
a
great
poem
for
which
i
have
no
use
i
made
him
the
same
offers
i
just
made
to
you
sir
do
you
know
what
he
said
he
told
me
to
do
something
unmentionable
he
did
indeed
and
rushed
out
of
the
office
he
not
live
long
that
young
man
good
day
good
day
forget
to
order
a
copy
of
hoken
spegel
well
good
day
good
day
smith
pointed
to
the
door
with
the
stem
of
his
pipe
and
falk
left
him
he
did
not
walk
away
with
light
footsteps
the
in
his
pocket
was
heavy
and
weighed
him
down
kept
him
back
he
thought
of
the
pale
young
man
with
the
roll
of
manuscript
who
had
dared
to
say
a
bold
thing
to
smith
and
pride
stirred
in
his
heart
but
memories
of
old
paternal
warnings
and
advice
whispered
the
old
lie
to
him
that
all
work
was
equally
honourable
and
reproved
him
for
his
pride
he
laid
hold
of
his
common
sense
and
went
home
to
write
a
hundred
and
inches
about
ulrica
eleonora
as
he
had
risen
early
he
was
at
his
at
nine
he
filled
a
large
pipe
took
two
sheets
of
paper
wiped
his
steel
nibs
and
tried
to
recall
all
he
knew
about
ulrica
eleonora
he
looked
her
up
in
ekelund
and
fryxell
there
was
a
great
deal
under
the
heading
ulrica
eleonora
but
very
little
about
her
personally
at
nine
he
had
exhausted
the
subject
he
had
written
down
her
birthplace
and
the
place
where
she
died
when
she
came
to
the
throne
when
she
abdicated
the
names
of
her
parents
and
the
name
of
her
husband
it
was
a
commonplace
excerpt
from
a
church
register
and
filled
three
pages
leaving
thirteen
to
be
covered
he
smoked
two
or
three
pipes
and
dragged
the
inkstand
with
his
pen
as
if
he
were
fishing
for
the
midgard
serpent
but
he
brought
up
nothing
he
was
bound
to
say
something
about
her
personally
sketch
her
character
he
felt
as
if
he
were
sitting
in
judgment
on
her
should
he
praise
or
revile
her
as
it
was
a
matter
of
complete
indifference
to
him
his
mind
was
still
not
made
up
when
it
struck
eleven
he
reviled
her
and
came
to
the
end
of
the
fourth
page
leaving
twelve
to
be
accounted
for
he
was
at
his
wits
end
he
wanted
to
say
something
about
her
rule
but
as
she
had
not
ruled
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
he
wrote
about
her
council
one
page
leaving
eleven
he
whitewashed
görtz
another
leaving
ten
he
had
not
yet
filled
half
the
required
space
he
hated
the
woman
more
pipes
fresh
steel
nibs
he
went
back
to
remoter
days
passing
them
in
review
and
being
now
in
a
thoroughly
bad
temper
he
overthrew
his
old
idol
charles
xii
and
hurled
him
in
the
dust
it
was
done
in
a
few
words
and
only
added
one
more
page
to
his
pile
there
still
remained
nine
he
anticipated
events
and
criticised
frederick
i
half
a
page
he
glanced
at
the
paper
with
unhappy
eyes
he
glimpsed
house
but
could
not
reach
it
he
had
written
seven
and
a
half
small
pages
ekelund
had
only
managed
one
and
a
half
he
flung
the
on
the
floor
kicked
it
underneath
his
crawled
after
it
dusted
it
and
put
it
in
its
former
place
it
was
torture
his
soul
was
as
dry
as
the
block
he
tried
to
work
himself
up
to
views
which
he
did
not
hold
he
tried
to
awaken
some
sort
of
emotion
in
his
heart
for
the
dead
queen
but
her
plain
dull
features
cut
into
the
wood
made
no
more
impression
on
him
than
he
on
the
block
he
realized
his
incapacity
and
felt
despondent
degraded
and
this
was
the
career
of
his
choice
the
one
he
had
preferred
to
all
others
with
a
strong
appeal
to
his
reason
he
turned
to
the
guardian
angel
the
brochure
was
originally
written
for
a
german
society
the
nereus
and
the
argument
was
as
follows
and
castle
had
emigrated
to
america
where
they
acquired
a
large
estate
to
make
the
story
possible
they
had
sold
their
land
and
very
unpractically
invested
the
total
amount
realized
in
costly
furniture
and
objects
of
art
as
the
story
required
that
everything
should
be
completely
lost
and
nothing
whatever
saved
from
the
shipwreck
they
sent
off
the
whole
lot
in
advance
by
the
a
steamer
copper
bottomed
with
watertight
bulkheads
and
insured
with
the
great
german
marine
insurance
company
for
and
castle
and
the
children
followed
on
the
the
finest
boat
of
the
white
star
line
insured
with
the
great
marine
insurance
company
nereus
capital
and
safely
arrived
at
liverpool
they
left
liverpool
and
all
went
well
until
they
came
to
skagen
point
during
the
whole
voyage
the
weather
had
of
course
been
magnificent
the
sky
was
clear
and
radiant
but
at
the
dangerous
skagen
point
a
storm
overtook
them
the
steamer
was
wrecked
the
parents
whose
lives
were
insured
were
drowned
thereby
guaranteeing
to
the
children
who
were
saved
the
latter
rejoicing
at
their
parents
foresight
arrived
at
hamburg
in
good
spirits
eager
to
take
possession
of
the
insurance
money
and
the
property
which
they
had
inherited
from
their
parents
imagine
their
consternation
when
they
were
told
that
the
had
been
wrecked
a
fortnight
before
their
arrival
on
dogger
bank
their
whole
fortune
which
had
been
left
uninsured
was
lost
all
that
remained
was
the
life
insurance
money
they
hurried
to
the
company
agents
a
fresh
disaster
they
were
told
that
their
parents
had
not
paid
the
last
premium
which
oh
fateful
blow
had
been
due
on
the
day
preceding
their
death
the
distressed
children
bitterly
mourned
their
parents
who
had
worked
so
hard
for
them
they
embraced
each
other
with
tears
and
made
a
solemn
vow
that
henceforth
all
their
possessions
should
be
insured
and
that
they
would
never
neglect
paying
their
life
insurance
premiums
this
story
was
to
be
localized
adapted
to
a
swedish
environment
and
made
into
a
readable
novelette
and
with
this
he
was
to
make
his
début
in
the
literary
world
the
devil
of
pride
whispered
to
him
not
to
be
a
blackguard
and
to
leave
the
business
alone
but
this
voice
was
silenced
by
another
which
came
from
the
region
of
his
empty
stomach
and
was
accompanied
by
a
gnawing
stinging
sensation
he
drank
a
glass
of
water
and
smoked
another
pipe
but
his
discomfort
increased
his
thoughts
became
more
gloomy
he
found
his
room
uncomfortable
the
morning
dull
and
monotonous
he
was
tired
and
despondent
everything
seemed
repulsive
his
ideas
were
spiritless
and
revolved
round
nothing
but
unpleasant
subjects
and
still
his
discomfort
grew
he
wondered
whether
he
was
hungry
it
was
one
he
never
dined
before
three
he
anxiously
examined
his
purse
threepence
halfpenny
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
would
have
to
go
without
dinner
this
was
a
trouble
hitherto
unknown
to
him
but
with
threepence
halfpenny
there
was
no
necessity
to
starve
he
could
send
for
bread
and
beer
no
that
would
not
do
it
was
go
to
a
dairy
no
borrow
impossible
he
knew
nobody
who
would
lend
no
sooner
had
he
realized
this
than
hunger
began
to
rage
in
him
like
a
wild
beast
let
loose
biting
him
tearing
him
and
chasing
him
round
the
room
he
smoked
pipe
after
pipe
to
stupefy
the
monster
in
vain
a
rolling
of
drums
from
the
barracks
yard
told
him
that
the
guardsmen
were
lining
up
with
their
copper
vessels
to
receive
their
dinner
every
chimney
was
smoking
the
dinner
bell
went
in
the
dockyard
a
hissing
sound
came
from
his
neighbour
the
policemen
kitchen
the
smell
of
roast
meat
penetrated
through
the
chinks
of
the
door
he
heard
the
rattling
of
knives
and
plates
in
the
adjacent
room
and
the
children
saying
grace
the
paviours
in
the
street
below
were
taking
their
nap
with
their
heads
on
their
empty
food
baskets
the
whole
town
was
dining
everybody
except
he
he
raged
against
god
but
all
at
once
a
clear
thought
shot
through
his
brain
he
seized
ulrica
eleonora
and
the
guardian
angel
wrapped
them
in
paper
wrote
name
and
address
on
the
parcel
and
handed
the
messenger
his
threepence
halfpenny
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
threw
himself
on
his
sofa
and
starved
with
a
heart
bursting
with
pride

the

the

had
great
faith
in
talent
lundell
was
calmly
working
at
his
descent
from
the
cross
he
had
already
sent
three
pictures
to
the
exhibition
and
like
many
others
he
was
awaiting
their
sale
with
a
certain
amount
of
excitement
it
fine
sellén
said
olle
you
paint
divinely
may
i
look
at
your
spinach
asked
lundell
who
never
admired
anything
on
principle
the
subject
was
simple
and
grand
the
picture
represented
a
stretch
of
drifting
sand
on
the
coast
of
halland
with
the
sea
in
the
background
it
was
full
of
the
feeling
of
autumn
sunbeams
were
breaking
through
riven
clouds
the
foreground
was
partly
drift
sand
and
newly
seaweed
dripping
wet
and
lit
by
the
sun
in
the
middle
distance
lay
the
sea
with
huge
crested
waves
the
greater
part
in
deep
shadow
but
in
the
background
on
the
horizon
the
sun
was
shining
opening
up
a
perspective
into
infinity
the
only
figures
were
a
flock
of
birds
no
unperverted
mind
who
had
the
courage
to
face
the
mysterious
wealth
of
solitude
had
seen
promising
harvests
choked
by
the
drifting
sand
could
fail
to
understand
the
picture
it
was
painted
with
inspiration
and
talent
the
colouring
was
the
result
of
the
prevailing
mood
the
mood
was
not
engendered
by
the
colouring
you
have
something
in
the
foreground
persisted
lundell
take
my
advice
rubbish
replied
sellén
do
what
i
tell
you
and
do
be
a
fool
otherwise
you
wo
sell
paint
in
a
figure
a
girl
by
preference
i
help
you
if
you
know
how
to
do
it
look
here
none
of
your
tricks
what
the
good
of
petticoats
in
a
high
wind
you
mad
on
petticoats
very
well
do
as
you
like
replied
lundell
a
little
hurt
by
the
reference
to
one
of
his
weakest
points
but
instead
of
those
grey
gulls
you
should
have
painted
storks
nobody
can
tell
what
sort
of
birds
these
are
picture
the
red
storks
legs
against
the
dark
cloud
what
a
contrast
you
do
understand
sellén
was
not
clever
in
stating
his
motives
but
he
was
sure
of
his
points
and
his
sound
instincts
led
him
safely
past
all
errors
you
wo
sell
lundell
began
again
his
friend
financial
position
worried
him
well
i
shall
live
somehow
in
spite
of
it
have
i
ever
sold
anything
am
i
the
worse
for
it
do
you
think
i
do
know
that
i
should
sell
if
i
painted
like
everybody
else
do
you
think
i
ca
paint
as
badly
as
everybody
else
i
just
do
want
to
but
you
ought
to
think
of
paying
your
debts
you
owe
lund
of
the
several
hundred
crowns
well
that
wo
ruin
him
moreover
i
gave
him
a
picture
worth
twice
that
amount
you
are
the
most
selfish
man
i
ever
met
the
picture
was
worth
twenty
crowns
i
value
it
at
five
hundred
as
prices
go
but
unfortunately
inclinations
and
tastes
differ
here
below
i
find
your
an
execrable
performance
you
find
it
beautiful
nobody
can
blame
you
for
it
tastes
differ
but
you
spoilt
our
credit
at
the
lund
refused
to
give
me
credit
yesterday
and
i
do
know
how
i
to
get
a
dinner
what
does
it
matter
do
without
it
i
have
had
a
dinner
these
last
two
years
you
plundered
falk
the
other
day
when
he
fell
into
your
clutches
that
true
he
a
nice
chap
moreover
he
has
talent
there
much
originality
in
his
verses
i
have
read
some
of
them
these
last
few
evenings
but
i
afraid
he
not
hard
enough
to
get
on
in
this
world
he
too
sensitive
the
rascal
if
he
sees
much
of
you
he
get
over
that
it
outrageous
how
you
spoilt
that
young
rehnhjelm
in
so
short
a
time
i
hear
you
are
encouraging
him
to
go
on
the
stage
did
he
tell
you
that
the
little
devil
he
get
on
if
he
remains
alive
but
that
not
so
simple
when
one
has
so
little
to
eat
death
i
no
more
paint
can
you
spare
any
white
merciful
lord
all
the
tubes
are
empty
you
must
give
me
some
lundell
i
no
more
than
i
want
for
myself
and
even
if
i
had
i
should
take
jolly
good
care
not
to
give
you
any
stop
talking
nonsense
you
know
there
no
time
to
lose
seriously
i
have
got
your
colours
if
you
were
so
wasteful
your
tubes
would
go
further
i
know
that
give
me
some
money
then
money
indeed
that
no
go
get
up
olle
you
must
go
and
pawn
something
at
the
word
pawn
olle
face
brightened
he
saw
a
prospect
of
food
sellén
was
searching
the
room
what
this
a
pair
of
boots
we
get
twopence
halfpenny
on
them
they
better
be
sold
they
rehnhjelm
you
ca
take
them
objected
lundell
who
had
meant
to
put
them
on
in
the
afternoon
when
he
was
going
up
to
town
surely
you
are
going
to
take
liberties
with
other
property
why
not
he
be
getting
money
for
them
what
in
this
parcel
a
velvet
waistcoat
a
beauty
i
shall
keep
it
for
myself
and
then
olle
can
pawn
mine
collars
and
cuffs
oh
paper
a
pair
of
socks
here
olle
twopence
halfpenny
wrap
them
in
the
waistcoat
you
can
sell
the
empty
bottles
i
think
the
best
thing
would
be
to
sell
everything
do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
going
to
sell
other
people
belongings
have
you
no
sense
of
right
and
wrong
interrupted
lundell
again
hoping
to
gain
possession
of
the
parcel
which
had
long
tempted
him
by
means
of
persuasion
he
get
paid
for
it
later
on
but
it
is
enough
yet
we
must
take
the
sheets
off
the
bed
why
not
we
do
want
any
sheets
here
olle
cram
them
in
olle
very
skilfully
made
a
bag
of
one
of
the
sheets
and
stuffed
everything
into
it
while
lundell
went
on
eagerly
protesting
when
the
parcel
was
made
olle
took
it
under
his
arm
buttoned
his
ragged
coat
so
as
to
hide
the
absence
of
a
waistcoat
and
set
out
on
his
way
to
the
town
he
looks
like
a
thief
said
sellén
watching
him
from
the
window
with
a
sly
smile
i
hope
the
police
wo
interfere
with
him
hurry
up
olle
he
shouted
after
the
retreating
figure
buy
six
french
rolls
and
two
of
beer
if
there
anything
over
after
you
bought
the
paint
olle
turned
round
and
waved
his
hat
with
as
much
assurance
as
if
he
had
the
feast
already
safely
in
his
pockets
lundell
and
sellén
were
alone
sellén
was
admiring
his
new
velvet
waistcoat
for
which
lundell
had
nursed
a
secret
passion
for
a
long
time
he
scraped
his
palette
and
cast
envious
glances
at
the
lost
glory
but
it
was
something
else
he
was
trying
to
speak
of
something
else
which
was
very
difficult
to
mention
i
wish
you
look
at
my
picture
he
said
at
last
what
do
you
think
of
it
seriously
do
draw
and
slave
at
it
so
much
paint
where
does
the
light
come
from
from
the
clothes
from
the
flesh
it
crazy
what
do
these
people
breathe
colour
turpentine
i
see
no
air
well
said
lundell
tastes
differ
as
you
said
just
now
what
do
you
think
of
the
composition
too
many
people
you
awful
i
want
more
not
fewer
let
me
see
there
one
great
mistake
in
it
sellén
shot
a
long
glance
at
the
picture
a
glance
peculiar
to
the
inhabitants
of
and
plains
yes
you
right
agreed
lundell
you
can
see
it
then
there
are
only
men
in
your
picture
it
somewhat
monotonous
that
it
but
fancy
that
you
should
see
that
you
want
a
woman
then
lundell
looked
at
him
wondering
whether
he
was
joking
but
was
unable
to
settle
the
point
for
sellén
was
whistling
yes
i
want
a
female
figure
he
replied
at
last
there
was
silence
and
gradually
the
silence
became
uncomfortable
two
very
old
acquaintances
in
a
conversation
i
wish
i
knew
where
to
get
a
model
from
i
do
want
the
academy
models
the
whole
world
knows
them
and
besides
the
subject
is
a
religious
one
you
want
something
better
i
understand
if
it
were
not
for
the
nude
i
might
perhaps
it
is
for
the
nude
are
you
mad
among
all
those
men
besides
it
a
religious
subject
yes
yes
we
know
all
that
she
must
be
dressed
in
something
oriental
and
bend
down
as
if
she
were
picking
up
something
show
her
shoulders
her
neck
and
the
first
vertebra
i
understand
religious
like
the
magdalene
view
you
scoff
and
jeer
at
everything
let
keep
to
the
point
you
shall
have
your
model
for
impossible
to
paint
without
one
you
yourself
do
know
one
very
well
your
religious
principles
do
allow
you
to
look
for
one
therefore
rehnhjelm
and
i
the
two
black
sheep
will
find
you
one
but
it
must
be
a
respectable
girl
do
forget
that
of
course
we
will
see
what
we
can
do
the
day
after
when
we
shall
be
in
funds
and
they
went
on
painting
quietly
diligently
until
four
until
five
every
now
and
then
their
anxious
glances
swept
the
road
sellén
was
the
first
to
break
the
uneasy
silence
olle
is
a
long
time
something
must
have
happened
to
him
he
said
yes
something
must
be
up
but
why
do
you
always
send
the
poor
devil
why
ca
you
run
your
own
errands
he
nothing
else
to
do
and
he
likes
going
how
know
and
besides
let
me
tell
you
nobody
can
say
how
olle
going
to
turn
out
he
has
great
schemes
and
he
may
be
on
his
feet
any
day
then
it
will
be
a
good
thing
to
have
him
for
a
friend
you
do
say
so
what
great
work
is
he
going
to
accomplish
i
can
quite
believe
that
olle
will
become
a
great
man
although
not
a
great
sculptor
but
where
the
devil
is
he
do
you
think
he
spending
the
money
possibly
possibly
he
had
nothing
for
a
long
time
and
perhaps
the
temptation
was
too
strong
answered
lundell
tightening
his
belt
by
two
holes
and
wondering
what
he
would
do
in
olle
place
well
he
only
human
and
charity
begins
at
home
said
sellén
who
knew
perfectly
well
what
he
would
have
done
under
the
circumstances
but
i
ca
wait
any
longer
i
must
have
paint
even
if
i
have
to
steal
it
i
go
and
see
falk
are
you
going
to
squeeze
more
out
of
that
poor
chap
you
robbed
him
yesterday
for
your
frame
and
it
was
a
small
sum
you
borrowed
my
dear
fellow
i
am
compelled
to
cast
all
feelings
of
shame
to
the
winds
there
no
help
for
it
one
has
to
put
up
with
a
good
deal
however
falk
is
a
fellow
who
understands
that
a
man
may
suddenly
find
himself
in
queer
street
anyhow
i
going
if
olle
returns
in
the
meantime
tell
him
he
a
blockhead
so
long
come
to
the
red
room
and
we
see
whether
our
master
will
be
graciously
pleased
to
give
us
something
to
eat
before
the
sun
sets
lock
the
door
when
you
leave
and
push
the
key
underneath
the
mat
he
went
and
before
long
he
stood
before
falk
door
in
count
magni
street
he
knocked
but
received
no
reply
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
falk
who
had
probably
had
uneasy
dreams
awakened
from
his
sleep
jumped
up
and
stared
at
sellén
without
recognizing
him
good
evening
old
chap
said
sellén
oh
it
you
i
must
have
had
a
strange
dream
good
evening
sit
down
and
smoke
a
pipe
is
it
evening
already
sellén
thought
he
knew
the
symptoms
but
he
pretended
to
notice
nothing
you
did
go
to
the
button
he
remarked
no
replied
falk
confused
i
was
there
i
was
at
iduna
he
really
did
not
know
whether
he
had
dreamt
it
or
whether
he
had
actually
been
there
but
he
was
glad
that
he
had
said
it
for
he
was
ashamed
of
his
position
perfectly
right
old
chap
commented
sellén
the
cooking
at
the
button
is
beneath
criticism
it
is
indeed
agreed
falk
the
soup
damned
bad
and
the
old
is
always
on
the
spot
counting
the
rolls
and
butter
the
rascal
the
words
rolls
and
butter
awakened
falk
to
consciousness
he
did
not
feel
hungry
only
a
little
shaky
and
faint
but
he
did
not
like
the
subject
of
conversation
and
changed
it
well
will
your
picture
be
ready
for
he
asked
no
unfortunately
it
wo
what
the
matter
now
i
ca
possibly
finish
it
you
ca
why
are
you
at
home
working
the
old
old
story
my
dear
fellow
i
have
no
paint
no
paint
but
there
a
remedy
for
that
or
have
you
any
money
if
i
had
i
should
be
all
right
and
i
have
any
either
what
to
be
done
sellén
dropped
his
eyes
until
his
glance
reached
the
height
of
waistcoat
pocket
into
which
a
heavy
gold
chain
was
creeping
not
that
sellén
believed
it
to
be
gold
good
stamped
gold
he
could
not
have
understood
the
recklessness
of
carrying
so
much
money
outside
waistcoat
but
his
thoughts
were
following
a
definite
course
and
he
continued
if
at
least
i
had
something
to
pawn
but
we
carelessly
pledged
our
winter
overcoats
on
the
first
sunny
day
in
april
falk
blushed
he
had
never
done
such
a
thing
do
you
pawn
your
winter
overcoats
he
asked
do
you
get
anything
on
them
one
gets
something
on
everything
on
everything
said
sellén
laying
stress
on
the
only
thing
needful
is
to
have
something
to
falk
the
room
seemed
to
be
turning
round
he
had
to
sit
down
then
he
pulled
out
his
gold
watch
how
much
do
you
think
should
i
get
on
this
watch
and
chain
sellén
seized
the
future
pledges
and
looked
at
them
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
is
it
gold
he
asked
faintly
it
is
gold
stamped
stamped
the
chain
too
the
chain
too
a
hundred
crowns
declared
sellén
shaking
his
hand
so
that
the
gold
chain
rattled
but
it
a
pity
you
should
pawn
your
things
for
my
sake
then
for
my
own
said
falk
anxious
to
avoid
the
semblance
of
an
unselfishness
which
he
did
not
feel
i
want
money
too
if
you
turn
them
into
cash
you
do
me
a
service
all
right
then
said
sellén
resolved
not
to
embarrass
his
friend
by
asking
indelicate
questions
i
pawn
them
pull
yourself
together
old
chap
life
is
hard
at
times
i
do
deny
it
but
we
go
through
with
it
he
patted
falk
shoulder
with
a
cordiality
which
did
not
often
pierce
the
scorn
with
which
he
had
enveloped
himself
they
went
out
together
by
the
time
they
had
concluded
the
business
it
was
seven
they
bought
the
paint
and
repaired
to
the
red
room
berns
salon
had
just
begun
to
play
its
civilizing
part
in
the
life
of
stockholm
by
putting
an
end
to
the
unhealthy
life
which
had
flourished
or
raged
in
the
sixties
and
from
the
capital
had
spread
over
the
whole
country
here
every
evening
after
seven
crowds
of
young
people
met
who
lived
in
that
abnormal
transition
stage
which
begins
on
leaving
the
parental
roof
and
ends
with
the
foundation
of
a
new
home
and
family
here
were
numbers
of
young
men
who
had
escaped
from
the
solitude
of
their
room
or
attic
to
find
light
and
warmth
and
a
to
talk
to
the
proprietor
had
made
more
than
one
attempt
to
amuse
his
patrons
by
pantomimic
gymnastic
ballet
and
other
performances
but
he
had
been
plainly
shown
that
his
guests
were
not
in
search
of
amusement
but
in
quest
of
peace
what
was
wanted
was
a
where
one
was
likely
every
moment
to
chance
on
a
friend
the
band
was
tolerated
because
it
did
not
stop
conversation
but
rather
stimulated
it
and
gradually
it
became
as
much
a
component
of
the
stockholm
evening
diet
as
punch
and
tobacco
in
this
way
berns
salon
became
the
bachelors
club
of
all
stockholm
every
circle
had
its
special
corner
the
colonists
of
had
usurped
the
inner
chess
room
usually
called
the
red
room
on
account
of
its
red
furniture
and
for
the
sake
of
brevity
it
was
a
safe
even
if
during
the
whole
day
the
members
had
been
scattered
like
chaff
when
times
were
hard
and
funds
had
to
be
raised
at
any
cost
regular
raids
were
made
from
this
spot
round
the
room
a
chain
was
formed
two
members
skirmished
in
the
galleries
and
two
others
attacked
the
room
lengthways
one
might
have
said
they
dredged
the
room
with
a
and
they
rarely
dredged
in
vain
for
there
was
a
constant
flow
of
new
arrivals
during
the
evening
however
these
efforts
were
not
required
sellén
calmly
and
proudly
sat
down
on
the
red
sofa
in
the
background
after
having
acted
a
little
farce
on
the
subject
of
what
they
were
going
to
drink
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
must
have
something
to
eat
first
they
were
starting
the
sexa
and
falk
was
beginning
to
feel
a
return
of
his
strength
when
a
long
shadow
fell
across
their
table
before
them
stood
ygberg
as
pale
and
emaciated
as
ever
sellén
who
was
in
funds
and
under
those
circumstances
invariably
courteous
and
pressed
him
to
have
dinner
with
them
and
falk
seconded
the
invitation
ygberg
hesitated
while
examining
the
contents
of
the
dishes
and
calculating
whether
his
hunger
would
be
satisfied
or
only
you
wield
a
stinging
pen
falk
he
said
in
order
to
deflect
the
attention
from
the
raids
which
his
fork
was
making
on
the
tray
how
what
do
you
mean
asked
falk
flushing
he
did
not
know
that
anybody
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
pen
the
article
has
created
a
sensation
what
article
i
do
understand
the
correspondence
in
the
on
the
board
of
payment
of
employés
salaries
i
did
write
it
but
the
board
is
convinced
that
you
did
i
just
met
a
member
who
a
friend
of
mine
he
mentioned
you
as
the
author
i
understood
that
the
resentment
was
fierce
indeed
falk
felt
that
he
was
half
to
blame
for
it
he
realized
now
what
the
notes
were
which
struve
had
been
making
on
that
evening
on
moses
height
but
struve
had
merely
reported
what
he
falk
had
said
he
was
responsible
for
his
statements
and
must
stand
by
them
even
at
the
risk
of
being
considered
a
retreat
was
impossible
he
realized
that
he
must
go
on
very
well
he
said
i
am
the
instigator
of
the
article
but
let
us
talk
of
something
else
what
do
you
think
of
ulrica
eleonora
is
she
an
interesting
character
or
what
is
your
opinion
of
the
maritime
insurance
company
triton
or
haquin
spegel
ulrica
eleonora
is
the
most
interesting
character
in
the
whole
history
of
sweden
answered
ygberg
gravely
i
just
had
an
order
to
write
an
essay
on
her
from
smith
asked
falk
yes
but
how
do
you
know
i
returned
the
block
this
afternoon
it
wrong
to
refuse
work
you
repent
it
believe
me
a
hectic
flush
crimsoned
falk
cheeks
he
spoke
feverishly
sellén
sat
quietly
on
the
sofa
smoking
he
paid
more
attention
to
the
band
than
to
the
conversation
which
did
not
interest
him
because
he
did
not
understand
it
from
his
sofa
corner
he
could
see
through
the
two
open
doors
leading
to
the
south
gallery
and
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
north
gallery
in
spite
of
the
dense
cloud
of
smoke
which
hung
above
the
pit
between
the
two
galleries
he
could
distinguish
the
faces
on
the
other
side
suddenly
his
attention
was
caught
by
something
in
the
distance
he
clutched
falk
arm
the
look
behind
the
left
curtain
lundell
just
so
he
looking
for
a
magdalene
see
he
talking
to
her
now
what
a
beautiful
girl
falk
blushed
a
fact
which
did
not
escape
sellén
does
he
come
here
for
his
models
he
asked
surprised
well
where
else
should
he
go
to
he
ca
find
them
in
the
dark
a
moment
afterwards
lundell
joined
them
sellén
greeted
him
with
a
patronizing
nod
the
significance
of
which
did
not
seem
to
be
lost
on
the
newcomer
he
bowed
to
falk
with
more
than
his
usual
politeness
and
expressed
his
astonishment
at
ygberg
presence
in
disparaging
words
ygberg
carefully
observing
him
seized
the
opportunity
to
ask
him
what
he
would
like
to
eat
lundell
opened
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
have
fallen
among
magnates
he
felt
happy
a
gentle
philanthropic
mood
took
possession
of
him
and
after
ordering
a
hot
supper
he
felt
constrained
to
give
expression
to
his
emotion
it
was
obvious
that
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
falk
but
it
was
difficult
to
find
an
opening
the
band
was
playing
hear
us
sweden
and
a
moment
afterwards
a
stronghold
is
our
god
falk
called
for
more
drink
i
wonder
whether
you
admire
this
fine
old
hymn
as
much
as
i
do
mr
falk
began
lundell
falk
who
was
not
conscious
of
admiring
any
one
hymn
more
than
another
asked
him
to
have
some
punch
lundell
had
misgivings
he
did
not
know
whether
he
could
venture
he
thought
he
had
better
have
some
more
supper
first
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
drink
he
tried
to
prove
it
after
his
third
liqueur
by
a
short
but
violent
attack
of
coughing
the
of
is
a
splendid
name
he
said
presently
it
proves
at
the
same
time
the
deep
religious
need
of
atonement
and
the
light
which
came
into
the
world
when
the
miracle
happened
which
has
always
given
offence
to
the
proud
in
spirit
he
swallowed
a
meat
ball
while
carefully
studying
the
effect
of
his
remark
and
felt
anything
but
flattered
when
he
saw
three
blank
faces
staring
at
him
expressing
nothing
but
consternation
spegel
is
a
great
name
and
his
words
are
not
like
the
words
of
the
pharisees
we
all
know
that
he
wrote
the
magnificent
psalm
wailing
cries
are
silent
a
psalm
which
has
never
been
equalled
your
health
falk
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
are
identifying
yourself
with
the
work
of
such
a
man
lundell
discovered
that
his
glass
was
empty
i
think
i
must
have
another
two
thoughts
were
humming
in
falk
brain
the
fellow
is
drinking
neat
brandy
and
how
did
he
get
to
know
about
spegel
a
suspicion
illuminated
his
mind
like
a
flash
of
lightning
but
he
pretended
to
know
nothing
and
merely
said
your
health
mr
lundell
the
unpleasant
explanation
which
seemed
bound
to
follow
was
avoided
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
olle
it
was
olle
but
more
rugged
than
before
dirtier
than
before
and
to
judge
from
his
appearance
lamer
than
before
his
hips
stood
out
beneath
his
coat
like
bowsprits
a
single
button
kept
his
coat
together
close
above
his
first
rib
but
he
was
in
good
spirits
and
laughed
on
seeing
so
much
food
and
drink
on
the
table
to
sellén
horror
he
began
to
report
on
the
success
of
his
mission
all
the
time
divesting
himself
of
his
acquisitions
he
had
really
been
arrested
by
the
police
here
are
the
tickets
he
handed
sellén
two
green
across
the
table
which
sellén
instantly
converted
into
a
paper
pellet
he
had
been
taken
to
the
police
station
he
pointed
to
his
coat
the
collar
of
which
was
missing
there
he
was
asked
for
his
name
his
name
was
of
course
assumed
there
existed
no
such
name
as
montanus
his
native
place
västmanland
again
a
false
statement
the
inspector
was
a
native
of
that
province
and
knew
his
countrymen
his
age
years
that
was
a
lie
he
must
be
at
least
forty
his
domicile
another
lie
nobody
but
a
gardener
lived
there
his
profession
artist
that
also
was
a
lie
for
he
looked
like
a
dock
labourer
here
your
paint
four
tubes
better
look
at
them
carefully
his
parcel
had
been
opened
and
in
the
process
one
of
the
sheets
had
been
torn
therefore
i
only
got
one
and
twopence
halfpenny
for
both
you
see
that
i
right
if
you
look
at
the
ticket
the
next
question
was
where
he
had
stolen
the
things
olle
had
replied
that
he
had
not
stolen
them
then
the
inspector
drew
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
had
not
been
asked
he
had
stolen
them
but
he
had
stolen
them
where
where
where
here
your
change
twopence
halfpenny
i
kept
nothing
back
then
the
evidence
was
taken
down
and
the
stolen
goods
which
had
been
sealed
with
three
seals
were
described
in
vain
had
olle
protested
in
vain
had
he
appealed
to
their
sense
of
justice
and
humanity
the
only
result
of
his
protestations
was
a
suggestion
made
by
the
constable
to
place
on
record
that
the
prisoner
he
was
already
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
prisoner
was
heavily
intoxicated
the
suggestion
was
acted
upon
but
the
word
heavily
was
omitted
after
the
inspector
had
repeatedly
urged
the
constable
to
try
and
remember
whether
the
prisoner
had
offered
resistance
at
his
arrest
and
the
constable
had
declared
that
he
could
not
take
his
oath
on
it
it
would
have
been
a
very
serious
matter
for
the
prisoner
looked
a
desperate
character
but
it
had
to
him
that
he
had
tried
to
resist
by
taking
refuge
in
a
doorway
the
latter
statement
was
placed
on
record
then
a
report
was
drawn
up
and
olle
was
ordered
to
sign
it
it
ran
as
follows
a
male
individual
of
sinister
and
forbidding
appearance
was
found
slinking
along
the
row
of
houses
in
northland
street
carrying
a
parcel
in
his
hand
on
his
arrest
he
was
dressed
in
a
green
he
wore
no
waistcoat
blue
serge
trousers
a
shirt
with
the
initials
which
clearly
proves
that
either
the
shirt
was
stolen
or
that
he
had
given
a
wrong
name
woollen
stockings
with
grey
edges
and
a
felt
hat
with
a
cock
feather
prisoner
gave
the
assumed
name
of
olle
montanus
falsely
deposed
that
his
people
were
peasants
in
västmanland
and
that
he
was
an
artist
domiciled
at
obviously
an
invention
on
being
arrested
he
tried
to
offer
resistance
by
taking
refuge
in
a
doorway
then
followed
a
minute
description
of
the
contents
of
the
parcel
as
olle
refused
to
admit
the
correctness
of
this
report
a
telegram
was
sent
to
the
prison
and
a
conveyance
appeared
to
fetch
olle
the
bundle
and
a
constable
as
they
were
turning
into
mint
street
olle
caught
sight
of
per
illson
a
member
of
parliament
and
a
countryman
of
his
he
called
to
him
and
per
illson
proved
that
the
report
was
wrong
olle
was
released
and
his
bundle
was
restored
to
him
and
now
he
had
come
to
join
them
and
here
are
your
french
rolls
there
are
only
five
of
them
for
eaten
one
and
here
the
beer
he
produced
five
french
rolls
from
his
coat
pockets
laid
them
on
the
table
and
placed
two
bottles
of
beer
which
he
pulled
out
of
his
trousers
pockets
by
the
side
of
them
after
which
his
figure
resumed
its
usual
disproportions
falk
old
chap
you
must
excuse
olle
he
not
used
to
smart
society
put
the
french
rolls
back
into
your
pockets
olle
what
will
you
be
up
to
next
said
sellén
disapprovingly
olle
obeyed
lundell
refused
to
have
the
tray
taken
away
although
he
had
cleared
the
dishes
so
thoroughly
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
say
what
they
had
contained
every
now
and
then
he
seized
the
brandy
bottle
and
poured
himself
out
half
a
glass
occasionally
he
stood
up
or
turned
round
in
his
chair
to
see
what
the
band
was
playing
on
those
occasions
sellén
kept
a
close
eye
on
him
at
last
rehnhjelm
arrived
he
had
obviously
been
drinking
he
sat
down
silently
his
eyes
seeking
an
object
on
which
they
could
rest
while
he
listened
to
lundell
exhortations
finally
his
weary
eyes
fell
on
sellén
and
remained
riveted
on
the
velvet
waistcoat
which
gave
him
plenty
of
food
for
thought
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
his
face
brightened
momentarily
as
if
he
had
met
an
old
friend
but
the
light
on
it
went
out
as
sellén
buttoned
up
his
coat
because
there
was
a
draught
ygberg
took
care
that
olle
had
some
supper
and
never
tired
of
urging
him
to
help
himself
and
to
fill
his
glass
as
the
evening
advanced
music
and
conversation
grew
more
and
more
lively
this
state
of
had
a
great
charm
for
falk
it
was
warm
light
and
noisy
here
he
was
in
the
company
of
men
whose
lives
he
had
prolonged
for
a
few
more
hours
and
who
were
therefore
gay
and
lively
as
flies
revived
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
he
felt
that
he
was
one
of
them
for
he
knew
that
in
their
inner
consciousness
they
were
unhappy
they
were
unassuming
they
understood
him
and
they
talked
like
human
beings
and
not
like
books
even
their
coarseness
was
not
unattractive
there
was
so
much
naturalness
in
it
so
much
innocence
even
hypocrisy
did
not
repulse
him
it
was
so
naïve
and
sat
on
him
so
loosely
that
it
could
have
been
cast
off
at
any
moment
and
the
evening
passed
away
and
the
day
was
over
which
had
pushed
falk
irrevocably
on
to
the
thorny
path
of
the

was

falk
stopped
for
a
few
moments
and
read
the
titles
of
the
books
exhibited
in
the
window
it
was
the
usual
thing
indiscreet
questions
impudent
charges
offensive
familiarities
but
his
attention
was
mainly
attracted
to
a
number
of
illustrated
magazines
with
large
english
woodcuts
displayed
in
the
window
in
order
to
attract
the
more
especially
the
children
papers
had
an
interesting
table
of
contents
and
the
young
man
in
the
shop
could
have
told
anyone
who
cared
to
know
that
old
men
and
women
would
pass
hours
before
this
window
lost
in
contemplation
of
the
illustrations
which
appeared
to
move
their
pious
hearts
and
awaken
memories
of
their
vanished
and
perhaps
wasted
youth
he
climbed
the
broad
staircase
between
pompeian
frescoes
reminiscent
of
the
path
which
does
not
lead
to
salvation
and
came
to
a
large
room
furnished
with
desks
like
a
bank
but
so
far
unoccupied
by
cashiers
and
in
the
centre
of
the
room
stood
a
of
the
size
of
an
altar
resembling
an
organ
with
many
stops
there
was
a
complete
with
buttons
and
semaphores
with
connected
with
all
parts
of
the
building
a
big
man
in
was
standing
at
the
he
wore
a
cassock
fastened
with
one
button
at
the
neck
which
gave
it
a
military
appearance
the
coat
was
surmounted
by
a
white
band
and
the
mask
of
a
sea
captain
for
the
real
face
had
long
ago
been
mislaid
in
one
of
the
desks
or
boxes
the
big
man
was
slapping
the
tops
of
his
boots
with
his
horsewhip
the
handle
of
which
was
in
the
form
of
a
symbolical
hoof
and
sedulously
smoking
and
chewing
a
strong
regalia
probably
to
keep
his
jaws
in
trim
falk
looked
at
the
big
man
in
astonishment
this
then
was
the
last
fashion
in
clergymen
for
in
men
too
there
is
a
fashion
this
was
the
great
promulgator
who
had
succeeded
in
making
it
fashionable
to
be
sinful
to
thirst
for
mercy
to
be
poor
and
wretched
in
fact
to
be
a
worthless
specimen
of
humanity
in
every
possible
way
this
was
the
man
who
had
brought
salvation
in
vogue
he
had
discovered
a
gospel
for
smart
society
the
divine
ordinance
of
grace
had
become
a
sport
there
were
competitions
in
viciousness
in
which
the
prize
was
given
to
the
sinner
paper
chases
were
arranged
to
catch
poor
souls
for
the
purpose
of
saving
them
but
also
let
us
confess
it
battues
for
subjects
on
whom
to
demonstrate
conversion
in
a
practical
manner
by
venting
on
them
the
most
cruel
charity
oh
it
you
falk
said
the
mask
welcome
dear
friend
perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
something
of
my
work
pardon
me
i
hope
you
are
saved
yes
this
is
the
office
of
the
printing
works
excuse
me
a
second
he
stepped
up
to
the
organ
and
pulled
out
several
stops
the
answer
was
a
long
whistle
just
have
a
look
round
he
put
his
mouth
to
one
of
the
trumpets
and
shouted
the
seventh
trumpet
and
the
eighth
woe
composition
mediæval
titles
gothic
names
spaced
out
a
voice
answered
through
the
same
trumpet
no
more
manuscript
the
mask
sat
down
at
the
organ
and
took
a
pen
and
a
sheet
of
foolscap
the
pen
raced
over
the
paper
while
he
talked
cigar
in
mouth
this
activity
is
so
extensive
that
it
would
soon
be
beyond
my
strength
and
my
health
would
be
worse
than
it
is
if
i
did
not
look
after
it
so
well
he
jumped
up
pulled
out
another
stop
and
shouted
into
another
trumpet
proofs
of
you
paid
your
debt
then
he
continued
writing
and
talking
you
wonder
why
i
wear
it
first
because
i
take
riding
exercises
for
the
sake
of
my
health
a
boy
appeared
with
proofs
the
mask
handed
them
to
falk
please
read
that
he
said
speaking
through
his
nose
because
his
mouth
was
busy
while
his
eyes
shouted
to
the
boy
wait
secondly
a
movement
of
the
ears
plainly
conveyed
to
falk
that
he
had
not
lost
the
thread
because
i
am
of
opinion
that
a
spiritually
minded
man
should
not
be
conspicuous
by
his
appearance
for
this
would
be
spiritual
pride
and
a
challenge
to
the
scoffers
a
entered
the
mask
acknowledged
his
salutation
by
a
wrinkling
of
his
forehead
the
only
part
of
his
face
which
was
unoccupied
for
want
of
something
else
to
do
falk
took
the
proofs
and
began
to
read
them
the
cigar
continued
talking
everybody
wears
i
wo
be
conspicuous
by
my
appearance
i
wear
because
i
no
humbug
he
handed
the
manuscript
to
the
boy
and
shouted
with
his
lips
four
sticks
seventh
trumpet
for
nyström
and
then
to
falk
i
shall
be
disengaged
in
five
minutes
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
warehouse
and
to
the
zululu
is
charging
brandy
answered
the
in
a
rusty
voice
everything
all
right
everything
all
right
in
god
name
then
come
along
mr
falk
they
entered
a
room
the
walls
of
which
were
lined
with
shelves
filled
with
piles
of
books
the
mask
touched
them
with
his
horsewhip
and
said
proudly
i
written
those
what
do
you
think
of
that
is
it
a
lot
you
too
write
a
little
if
you
stick
to
it
you
might
write
as
much
he
bit
and
tore
at
his
cigar
and
spat
out
the
tiny
flakes
which
filled
the
air
like
flies
and
settled
on
the
backs
of
the
books
his
face
wore
a
look
of
contempt
the
of
hm
i
think
it
a
stupid
name
you
rather
agree
with
me
what
made
you
think
of
it
for
the
first
time
falk
had
a
chance
of
getting
in
a
word
for
like
all
great
men
the
mask
answered
his
own
questions
his
reply
was
in
the
negative
but
he
got
no
further
the
mask
again
usurped
the
conversation
i
think
it
a
very
stupid
name
and
do
you
really
believe
that
it
will
draw
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
the
matter
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
you
do
know
he
took
up
a
paper
and
pointed
to
a
paragraph
falk
very
much
taken
aback
read
the
following
advertisement
notice
to
subscribers
the
of
magazine
for
christian
readers
about
to
appear
under
the
editorship
of
arvid
falk
whose
work
has
been
awarded
a
prize
by
the
academy
of
sciences
the
first
number
will
contain
creation
by
hokan
spegel
a
poem
of
an
admittedly
religious
and
profoundly
christian
spirit
falk
had
forgotten
spegel
and
his
agreement
he
stood
speechless
how
large
is
the
edition
going
to
be
what
two
thousand
i
suppose
too
small
no
good
my
was
ten
thousand
and
yet
i
did
make
more
than
what
shall
i
say
fifteen
net
fifteen
thousand
young
man
the
mask
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
part
and
reverted
to
old
habits
you
know
he
continued
that
i
a
popular
preacher
i
may
say
that
without
boasting
for
all
the
world
knows
it
you
know
that
i
very
popular
i
ca
help
that
it
is
so
i
should
be
a
hypocrite
if
i
pretended
not
to
know
what
all
the
world
knows
well
i
give
you
a
helping
hand
to
begin
with
look
at
this
bag
here
if
i
say
that
it
contains
letters
from
persons
ladies
do
upset
yourself
i
a
married
man
begging
for
my
portrait
i
have
not
said
too
much
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
nothing
but
an
ordinary
bag
which
he
touched
with
his
whip
to
save
them
and
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
at
the
same
time
for
the
sake
of
doing
a
a
kindness
i
have
decided
to
permit
you
to
write
my
biography
then
you
can
safely
issue
ten
thousand
copies
of
your
first
number
and
pocket
a
clear
thousand
but
my
dear
pastor
he
had
it
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
say
captain
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
this
matter
never
mind
never
mind
the
publisher
has
himself
written
to
me
and
asked
me
for
my
portrait
and
you
are
to
write
my
biography
to
facilitate
your
work
i
asked
a
friend
to
write
down
the
principal
points
you
have
only
to
write
an
introduction
brief
and
eloquent
a
few
sticks
at
the
most
that
all
so
much
foresight
depressed
falk
he
was
surprised
to
find
the
portrait
so
unlike
the
original
and
the
friend
handwriting
so
much
like
that
of
the
mask
the
latter
who
had
given
him
portrait
and
manuscript
now
held
out
his
hand
expecting
to
be
thanked
my
regards
to
the
publisher
he
had
so
nearly
said
smith
that
a
slight
blush
appeared
between
his
whiskers
but
you
do
know
my
views
yet
protested
falk
views
have
i
asked
what
your
views
are
i
never
ask
anybody
about
his
views
god
forbid
i
never
once
more
he
touched
the
backs
of
his
publications
with
his
whip
opened
the
door
let
the
biographer
out
and
returned
to
his
service
at
the
altar
falk
as
usual
could
not
think
of
a
suitable
answer
until
it
was
too
late
when
he
thought
of
one
he
was
already
in
the
street
a
cellar
window
which
happened
to
stand
wide
open
and
was
not
covered
with
advertisements
received
biography
and
portrait
into
safe
keeping
then
falk
went
to
the
nearest
newspaper
office
handed
in
a
protest
against
the
of
and
resigned
himself
to
starve
chapter
viii
poor
mother
country
the
clock
on
the
riddarholms
church
struck
ten
as
falk
arrived
a
few
days
later
at
the
parliamentary
buildings
to
assist
the
representative
of
the
red
cap
in
reporting
the
proceedings
of
the
second
chamber
he
hastened
his
footsteps
convinced
that
here
where
the
pay
was
good
strict
punctuality
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
matter
of
course
he
climbed
the
committee
stairs
and
was
shown
to
the
reporters
gallery
on
the
left
a
feeling
of
awe
overcame
him
as
he
walked
across
the
few
boards
hung
up
under
the
roof
like
a
pigeon
house
where
the
men
of
free
speech
listen
to
the
discussion
of
the
country
most
sacred
interests
by
the
country
most
worthy
representatives
it
was
a
new
sensation
to
falk
but
he
was
far
from
being
impressed
as
he
looked
down
from
his
scaffolding
into
the
empty
hall
which
resembled
a
lancastrian
school
it
was
five
minutes
past
ten
but
with
the
exception
of
himself
not
a
soul
was
present
all
of
a
sudden
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
scraping
noise
a
rat
he
thought
but
almost
immediately
he
discovered
on
the
opposite
gallery
across
the
huge
empty
hall
a
short
abject
figure
sharpening
a
pencil
on
the
rail
he
watched
the
chips
fluttering
down
and
settling
on
the
tables
below
his
eyes
scanned
the
empty
walls
without
finding
a
until
finally
they
fell
on
the
old
clock
dating
from
the
time
of
napoleon
i
with
its
imperial
newly
lit
emblems
symbolical
of
the
old
story
and
its
hands
now
pointing
to
ten
minutes
past
ten
symbolical
in
the
spirit
of
irony
of
something
else
at
the
same
moment
the
doors
in
the
background
opened
and
a
man
entered
he
was
old
his
shoulders
stooped
under
the
burden
of
public
offices
his
back
had
shrunk
under
the
weight
of
communal
commissions
the
long
continuance
in
damp
offices
and
safe
deposits
had
warped
his
neck
there
was
a
suggestion
of
the
pensioner
in
his
calm
footsteps
as
he
walked
up
the
matting
towards
the
chair
when
he
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
long
passage
and
had
come
into
line
with
the
imperial
clock
he
stopped
he
seemed
accustomed
to
stopping
and
looking
round
and
backwards
but
now
he
stopped
to
compare
his
watch
with
the
clock
he
shook
his
old
worn
out
head
with
a
look
of
discontent
fast
fast
he
murmured
his
features
expressed
a
supernatural
calm
and
the
assurance
that
his
watch
could
not
be
slow
he
continued
his
way
with
the
same
deliberate
footsteps
he
might
be
walking
towards
the
goal
of
his
life
and
it
was
very
much
a
question
whether
he
had
not
attained
it
when
he
arrived
at
the
venerable
chair
on
the
platform
when
he
was
standing
close
by
it
he
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
his
eyes
roamed
over
the
brilliant
audience
of
chairs
and
tables
announcing
an
important
event
gentlemen
i
have
blown
my
nose
then
he
sat
down
and
sank
into
a
presidential
calm
which
might
have
been
sleep
if
it
had
not
been
waking
and
alone
in
the
large
room
as
he
imagined
alone
with
his
god
he
prepared
to
summon
strength
for
the
business
of
the
day
when
a
loud
scraping
on
the
left
high
up
underneath
the
roof
pierced
the
stillness
he
started
and
turned
his
head
to
kill
with
a
look
the
rat
which
dared
to
gnaw
in
his
presence
falk
who
had
omitted
to
take
into
account
the
resonant
capacity
of
the
pigeon
house
received
the
deadly
thrust
of
the
murderous
glance
but
the
glance
softened
as
it
slid
down
from
the
whispering
only
a
reporter
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
a
rat
and
deep
regret
stole
over
the
murderer
contrition
at
the
sin
committed
by
his
eye
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
wept
oh
no
he
rubbed
off
the
spot
which
the
appearance
of
a
repulsive
object
had
thrown
on
his
retina
presently
the
doors
were
flung
wide
open
the
delegates
were
beginning
to
arrive
while
the
hands
on
the
clock
crept
forward
forward
the
president
rewarded
the
good
with
friendly
nods
and
pressures
of
the
hand
and
punished
the
by
turning
away
his
head
he
was
bound
to
be
just
as
the
most
high
the
reporter
of
the
red
cap
arrived
an
unprepossessing
individual
not
quite
sober
and
only
half
awake
in
spite
of
this
he
seemed
to
find
pleasure
in
answering
truthfully
the
questions
put
by
the
newcomer
once
more
the
doors
were
flung
open
and
in
stalked
a
man
with
as
much
as
if
he
were
in
his
own
home
he
was
the
treasurer
of
the
inland
revenue
office
and
actuary
of
the
board
of
payment
of
employés
salaries
he
approached
the
chair
greeted
the
president
like
an
old
acquaintance
and
began
to
rummage
in
the
papers
as
if
they
were
his
own
who
this
asked
falk
the
chief
clerk
answered
his
friend
from
the
red
cap
what
do
they
write
here
too
then
too
you
soon
see
they
keep
a
story
full
of
clerks
the
attics
are
full
of
clerks
and
they
soon
have
clerks
in
the
cellars
the
room
below
was
now
presenting
the
aspect
of
an
a
rap
of
the
hammer
and
there
was
silence
the
head
clerk
read
the
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
and
they
were
signed
without
comment
then
the
same
man
read
a
petition
for
a
fortnight
leave
sent
in
by
jon
jonson
from
lerbak
it
was
granted
do
they
have
holidays
here
asked
the
novice
surprised
certainly
jon
jonson
wants
to
go
home
and
plant
his
potatoes
the
platform
down
below
was
now
beginning
to
fill
with
young
men
armed
with
pen
and
paper
all
of
them
were
old
acquaintances
from
the
time
when
falk
was
a
government
official
they
took
their
seats
at
little
tables
as
if
they
were
going
to
play
preference
those
are
the
clerks
explained
the
red
cap
they
appear
to
recognize
you
and
they
really
did
they
put
on
their
and
stared
at
the
pigeon
house
with
the
condescension
vouchsafed
in
a
theatre
by
the
occupants
of
the
stalls
to
the
occupants
of
the
galleries
they
whispered
among
themselves
evidently
discussing
an
absent
acquaintance
who
from
unmistakable
evidence
must
have
been
sitting
on
the
chair
occupied
by
falk
the
latter
was
so
deeply
touched
by
the
general
interest
that
he
looked
with
anything
but
a
friendly
eye
on
struve
who
was
entering
the
pigeon
house
reserved
unembarrassed
dirty
and
a
conservative
the
chief
clerk
read
a
petition
or
a
resolution
to
grant
the
necessary
money
for
the
provision
of
new
door
mats
and
new
brass
numbers
on
the
lockers
destined
for
the
reception
of
overshoes
granted
where
is
the
opposition
asked
the
tyro
the
devil
knows
but
they
say
yes
to
everything
wait
a
little
and
you
see
have
they
come
yet
here
every
one
comes
and
goes
as
he
pleases
but
this
is
the
government
offices
all
over
again
the
conservative
struve
who
had
heard
the
frivolous
words
thought
it
incumbent
on
him
to
take
up
the
cudgels
for
the
government
what
is
this
little
falk
is
saying
he
asked
he
must
growl
here
it
took
falk
so
long
to
find
a
suitable
reply
that
the
discussions
down
below
had
started
in
the
meantime
do
mind
him
said
the
red
cap
soothingly
he
invariably
a
conservative
when
he
has
the
price
of
a
dinner
in
his
pocket
and
just
borrowed
a
fiver
from
me
the
chief
clerk
was
reading
report
of
the
committee
on
ola
hipsson
motion
to
remove
the
fences
timber
merchant
larsson
from
norrland
demanded
acceptance
as
it
stood
what
is
to
become
of
our
forests
he
burst

he
threw
himself
on
his
bench
puffing
this
racy
eloquence
had
gone
out
of
fashion
during
the
last
few
years

the
words
were
received
with

that

that
the

should
be

he
laid

a

rather

the

with

smoothed

and
provided

with

falk
took
a
rest
accidentally
scanning
the
strangers
gallery
his
gaze
fell
on
a
head
resting
on
the
rail
and
belonging
to
olle
montanus
at
the
moment
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
dog
carefully
watching
a
bone
and
he
was
not
there
without
a
very
definite
reason
but
falk
was
in
the
dark
olle
was
very
secretive
from
the
end
of
the
bench
just
below
the
right
gallery
on
the
very
spot
where
the
abject
individual
pencil
chips
had
fluttered
down
a
man
now
arose
he
wore
a
blue
uniform
had
a
hat
tucked
under
his
arm
and
held
a
roll
of
paper
in
his
hand
the
hammer
fell
and
an
ironical
malicious
silence
followed

said
the
red

take

who

these

the
man
in

was
reading

most
gracious
proposition
to

the

of

assisting

in

great
excitement
at

tables
great
excitement
on
chair
now
the
paper
roll
rolled
itself
up
the
chairman
rose
and
thanked
the
reader
with
a
bow
which
plainly
said
is
there
nothing
else
we
can
do
the
owner
of
the
paper
roll
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
blew
away
the
chips
the
man
above
him
had
allowed
to
fall
down
his
stiff
embroidered
collar
prevented
him
from
committing
the
same
offence
which
the
president
had
perpetrated
earlier
in
the
morning
the
proceedings
continued
the
peasant
sven
svensson
asked
for
permission
to
say
a
few
words
on
the
poor
law
with
one
accord
all
the
reporters
arose
yawned
and
stretched
themselves
we
go
to
lunch
now
explained
the
red
cap
we
have
an
hour
and
ten
minutes
but
sven
svensson
was
speaking
the
delegates
began
to
get
up
from
their
places
two
or
three
of
them
went
out
the
president
spoke
to
some
of
the
good
members
and
by
doing
so
expressed
in
the
name
of
the
government
his
disapproval
of
all
sven
svensson
might
be
going
to
say
two
older
members
pointed
him
out
to
a
newcomer
as
if
he
were
a
strange
beast
they
watched
him
for
a
few
moments
found
him
ridiculous
and
turned
their
backs
on
him
the
red
cap
was
under
the
impression
that
politeness
required
him
to
explain
that
the
speaker
was
the
scourge
of
the
chamber
he
was
neither
hot
nor
cold
could
be
used
by
no
party
be
won
for
no
interests
but
he
spoke
spoke
what
he
spoke
about
no
one
could
tell
for
no
paper
reported
him
and
nobody
took
the
trouble
to
look
up
the
records
but
the
clerks
at
the
tables
had
sworn
that
if
they
ever
came
into
power
they
would
amend
the
laws
for
his
sake
falk
however
who
had
a
certain
weakness
for
all
those
who
were
overlooked
remained
behind
and
heard
what
he
had
not
heard
for
many
a
day
a
man
of
honour
who
lived
an
irreproachable
life
espousing
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
and
the
while
nobody
listened
to
him
struve
at
the
sight
of
the
peasant
had
taken
his
own
departure
and
had
gone
to
a
restaurant
he
was
quickly
followed
by
all
the
reporters
and
half
the
deputies
after
luncheon
they
returned
and
sat
down
on
the
narrow
stairs
for
a
little
longer
they
heard
sven
svensson
speaking
or
rather
saw
him
speaking
for
now
the
conversation
had
become
so
lively
that
not
a
single
word
of
the
speech
could
be
understood
but
the
speaker
was
bound
to
come
to
an
end
nobody
had
any
objections
to
make
his
speech
had
no
result
whatever
it
was
exactly
as
if
it
had
never
been
made
the
chief
clerk
who
during
this
interval
had
had
time
to
go
to
his
offices
look
at
the
official
papers
and
poke
his
fires
was
again
in
his
place
reading
memorial
of
the
royal
commission
on
per
ilsson
motion
to
grant
ten
thousand
crowns
for
the
restoration
of
the
old
sculptures
in
the
church
of
träskola
the
dog
head
on
the
rail
of
the
strangers
gallery
assumed
a
threatening
aspect
he
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
fight
for
his
bone
do
you
know
the
freak
up
there
in
the
gallery
asked
the
red
cap
olle
montanus
yes
i
know
him
do
you
know
that
he
and
the
church
of
träskola
are
countrymen
he
a
shrewd
fellow
look
at
the
expression
on
his
face
now
that
turn
has
come
per
ilsson
was
speaking
struve
contemptuously
turned
his
back
on
the
speaker
and
cut
himself
a
piece
of
tobacco
but
falk
and
the
red
cap
trimmed
their
pencils
for
action
you
take
the
flourishes
i
take

said
the
red
cap
after
the
lapse
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
falk

was
covered
with
the
following
notes

the
speech
which
had
repeatedly
called
forth
universal
amusement
especially
at
the
exhumation
of
the
deceased
fichte
provoked
replies
from
the
metropolitan
bench
and
the
bench
of
upsala
the
delegate
on
the
metropolitan
bench
said
that
although
he
knew
neither
the
church
of
träskola
nor
fichte
and
doubted
whether
the
old
were
worth
ten
thousand
crowns
yet
he
thought
himself
justified
in
urging
the
chamber
to
encourage
this
beautiful
undertaking
as
it
was
the
first
time
the
majority
had
asked
for
money
for
a
purpose
other
than
the
building
of
bridges
fences
national
schools
etc
the
delegate
on
the
bench
of
upsala
held
according
to
notes
that
the
mover
of
the
proposition
was
right
that
his
premise
that
native
culture
should
be
encouraged
was
correct
that
the
conclusion
that
ten
thousand
crowns
should
be
voted
was
binding
that
the
purpose
the
aim
the
tendency
was
beautiful
praiseworthy
patriotic
but
an
error
had
certainly
been
committed
by
whom
by
the
mother
country
the
state
the
church
no
by
the
proponent
the
proponent
was
right
according
to
common
sense
and
therefore
the
speaker
he
begged
the
chamber
to
pardon
the
repetition
could
only
praise
the
purpose
the
aim
the
tendency
the
proposition
had
its
warmest
sympathies
he
was
calling
on
the
chamber
in
the
name
of
the
mother
country
in
the
name
of
art
and
civilization
to
vote
for
it
but
he
himself
felt
bound
to
vote
against
it
because
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
conformable
to
the
idea
it
was
erroneous
motiveless
and
figurative
as
it
subsumed
the
conception
of
the
place
under
that
of
the
state
the
head
in
the
strangers
gallery
rolled
its
eyes
and
moved
its
lips
convulsively
while
the
motion
was
put
to
the
vote
but
when
the
proceeding
was
over
and
the
proposition
had
been
accepted
the
head
disappeared
in
the
discontented
and
jostling
audience
falk
did
not
fail
to
understand
the
connexion
between
per
proposition
and
olle
presence
and
disappearance
struve
who
had
become
even
more
loud
and
conservative
after
lunch
talked
unreservedly
of
many
things
the
red
cap
was
calm
and
indifferent
he
had
ceased
to
be
astonished
at
anything
from
the
dark
cloud
of
humanity
which
had
been
rent
by
olle
exit
suddenly
broke
a
face
clear
bright
and
radiant
as
the
sun
and
arvid
falk
whose
glances
had
strayed
to
the
gallery
felt
compelled
to
cast
down
his
eyes
and
turn
away
his
head
he
had
recognized
his
brother
the
head
of
the
family
the
pride
of
the
name
which
he
intended
to
make
great
and
honourable
behind
nicholas
falk
shoulder
half
of
a
black
face
could
be
seen
gentle
and
deceitful
which
seemed
to
whisper
secrets
into
the
ear
of
the
fair
man
falk
had
only
time
to
be
surprised
at
his
brother
presence
he
knew
his
resentment
at
the
new
form
of
administration
for
the
president
had
given
anders
andersson
permission
to
state
a
proposition
andersson
availed
himself
of
the
permission
with
the
greatest
calm
in
view
of
certain
events
he
read
move
that
a
bill
should
be
passed
making
his
majesty
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
all
companies
whose
statutes
he
has
sanctioned
the
sun
on
the
strangers
gallery
lost
its
brilliancy
and
a
storm
burst
out
in
the
chamber
like
a
flash
count
splint
was
on
his
legs
tandem
catilina
it
has
come
to
that
members
are
forgetting
themselves
so
far
as
to
dare
to
criticize
government
yes
gentlemen
criticize
government
or
what
is
even
worse
make
a
joke
of
it
for
this
motion
can
not
be
anything
but
a
vulgar
joke
did
i
say
joke
it
is
treason
oh
my
poor
country
your
unworthy
sons
have
forgotten
the
debt
they
owe
you
but
what
else
can
we
expect
now
that
you
have
lost
your
knightly
guard
your
shield
and
your

i
request
the
blackguard
per

or
whatever
his

may
be

by

shall
see

have

to
pick
up
a

and
fling
it

of
the
hydra
of
treason
applause
from
the

indignation
in
the
chamber
ha
do
you
think
i
afraid
the
speaker
made
a
gesture
as
if
he
were
throwing
a
stone
but
on
every
one
of
the
hydra
hundred
faces
lay
a
smile
glaring
round
in
search
of
a
hydra
which
did
not
smile
the
speaker
discovered
it
in
the
reporters
gallery
there
there
he
pointed
to
the
pigeon
house
and
in
his
eyes
lay
an
expression
as
if
he
saw
all
hell
open
that
the
crows
nest
i
hear
their
croaking
but
it
does
frighten
me

then
the
kingdom
will
flourish
in

and
its

thus
speaks
a
swedish
nobleman
peasants
remember
his
words
this
speech
which
three
years
ago
would
have
been
welcomed
with
acclamations
taken
down
verbatim
and
printed
and
circulated
in
national
schools
and
other
charitable
institutions
was
received
with
universal
laughter
an
amended
version
was
placed
on
the
record
and
strange
to
say
it
was
only
reported
by
the
opposition
papers
which
do
not
as
a
rule
care
to
publish
outbursts
of
this
description
the
upsala
bench
again
craved
permission
to
speak
the
speaker
quite
agreed
with
the
last
speaker
his
acute
ear
had
caught
something
of
the
old
rattling
of
swords
he
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
he
would
like
to
speak
of
the
of
a
company
as
an
idea
but
begged
to
be
allowed
to
explain
to
the
chamber
that
a
company
was
not
an
accumulation
of
funds
not
a
combination
of
people
but
a
moral
personality
and
as
such
not
responsible
shouts
of
laughter
and
loud
conversation
prevented
the
reporters
from
hearing
the
remainder
of
the
argument
which
closed
with
the
remark
that
the
interests
of
the
country
were
at
stake
conformable
to
the
idea
and
that
if
the
motion
were
rejected
the
interests
of
the
country
would
be
neglected
and
the
state
in
danger
six
speakers
filled
up
the
interval
until
by
giving
extracts
from
the
official
statistics
of
sweden
nauman
fundamental
statutes
the
legal
textbook
and
the
göteberg
commercial
gazette
the
conclusion
invariably
arrived
at
was
that
the
country
was
in
danger
if
his
majesty
were
to
be
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
all
companies
the
statutes
of
which
he
had
sanctioned
and
that
the
interests
of
the
whole
country
were
at
stake
one
of
the
speakers
was
bold
enough
to
say
that
the
interests
of
the
country
stood
on
a
throw
of
the
dice
others
were
of
the
opinion
that
they
stood
on
a
card
others
again
that
they
hung
on
a
thread
the
last
speaker
said
they
hung
on
a
hair
at
noon
the
proposition
to
go
into
committee
on
the
motion
was
rejected
that
was
to
say
there
was
no
need
for
the
country
to
go

of
your
logic
go
on
they
were
all
here
mamma
and
your
five
sisters
four
sisters
you
do
care
much
for
your
family
no
more
do
you

more
do
i
and
they
came
here
to
condole
with
you
on
account
of
my
discharge
is
that
so
yes
and
they
were
impertinent
enough
to
say
that
i
had
no
longer
any
reason
to
be
stuck
up
proud
old
girl
they
said
personally
i
should
never
have
condescended
to
make
use
of
such
an
expression
what
did
you
say
i
expect
you
gave
them
a
piece
of
your
mind
you
may
depend
on
that
the
old
lady
threatened
never
again
to
cross
our
threshold
did
she
really
do
you
think
she
meant
it
no
i
do
but
i
certain
that
the
old
man
you
should
speak
of
your
father
in
that
tone
supposing
somebody
heard
you
do
you
think
i
should
run
that
risk
however
the
old
man
between
you
and
me
will
never
come
here
again
falk
pondered
after
a
while
he
resumed
the
conversation
is
your
mother
proud
is
she
easily
hurt
i
always
so
afraid
of
hurting
people
feelings
as
you
know
you
ought
to
tell
me
about
her
weak
points
so
that
i
can
take
care
you
ask
me
whether
she
is
proud
you
know
she
is
in
her
own
way
supposing
for
instance
she
was
told
that
we
had
given
a
without
asking
her
and
my
sisters
she
would
never
come
here
again
would
she
really
you
may
depend
upon
it
it
extraordinary
that
people
of
her
class
what
that
oh
nothing
women
are
so
sensitive
how
your
association
getting
on
what
did
you
call
it
the
association
for
the
promotion
of
women
rights
what
rights
do
you
mean
the
wife
shall
have
the
right
of
disposing
of
her
own
property
has
she
got
it
already
no
she
has
may
i
ask
what
your
property
is
of
which
you
are
not
allowed
to
dispose
half
of
your
old
man
my
dowry
the
devil
who
taught
you
such
rubbish
it
not
rubbish
it
the
spirit
of
the
age
my
dear
the
new
law
should
read
like
this
a
woman
marries
she
becomes
the
owner
of
half
her
husband
property
and
of
this
half
she
can
dispose
as
she
likes
and
when
she
has
run
through
it
the
husband
will
have
to
keep
her
i
should
take
jolly
good
care
not
to
under
the
new
law
you
would
be
forced
to
do
so
or
go
to
the
this
would
be
the
penalty
for
a
man
who
does
keep
his
wife
take
care
you
are
going
too
far
but
have
you
any
meetings
who
were
the
women
present
tell
me
we
are
still
busy
with
the
statutes
with
the
preliminaries
but
who
are
the
women
at
present
only
homan
the
controller
wife
and
lady
rehnhjelm
rehnhjelm
a
very
good
name
i
think
i
heard
it
before
but
you
tell
me
you
were
going
to
float
a
dorcas
society
as
well
a
dorcas
society
oh
yes
and
what
think
pastor
skore
is
coming
one
evening
to
read
a
paper
pastor
skore
is
an
excellent
preacher
and
moves
in
good
society
glad
that
you
keeping
away
from
the
lower
classes
there
nothing
so
fatal
to
man
or
woman
as
to
form
low
connexions
my
father
always
said
that
it
was
one
of
his
strictest
principles
falk
picked
up
the
from
the
tablecloth
and
dropped
them
into
her
empty
cup
falk
put
his
fingers
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
brought
out
a
with
which
he
removed
some
tiny
atoms
of
coffee
grounds
lodged
between
his
teeth
husband
and
wife
felt
in
each
other
company
each
guessed
the
thoughts
of
the
other
and
both
realized
that
the
first
who
broke
the
silence
would
say
something
foolish
and
compromising
they
cast
about
for
fresh
subjects
of
conversation
mentally
examined
them
and
found
them
unsuitable
every
one
of
them
had
some
connexion
with
what
had
been
said
or
could
be
brought
into
connexion
with
it
falk
would
have
liked
to
have
reason
for
finding
fault
with
the
breakfast
so
as
to
have
an
excuse
for
expressing
indignation
falk
looked
out
of
the
window
feebly
hoping
that
there
might
be
a
change
in
the
weather
in
vain
a
entered
and
saved
the
situation
by
offering
them
a
tray
with
the
newspapers
at
the
same
time
announcing
levin
ask
him
to
wait
said
the
master
curtly
for
a
few
moments
his
boots
squeaked
up
and
down
the
room
preparing
the
visitor
who
was
waiting
in
the
corridor
for
his
arrival
the
trembling
levin
greatly
impressed
by
the
newly
invented
waiting
in
the
corridor
was
ultimately
conducted
into
the
master
private
room
where
he
was
received
like
a
petitioner
have
you
brought
the
bill
of
exchange
with
you
asked
falk
i
think
so
replied
the
crestfallen
levin
producing
a
bundle
of
guarantees
and
blank
bills
of
various
values
which
bank
do
you
prefer
i
have
bills
on
all
with
the
exception
of
one
in
spite
of
the
grave
character
of
the
situation
falk
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
looked
at
the
incomplete
guarantees
on
which
the
name
was
missing
the
bills
fully
filled
up
with
the
exception
of
an
name
and
those
completely
filled
up
which
had
not
been
accepted
let
say
the
ropemakers
bank
he
said
that
the
one
impossible
one
i
known
there
well
the
shoemakers
bank
the
tailors
bank
any
one
you
like
only
do
be
quick
about
it
they
finally
accepted
the
joiners
bank
and
now
said
falk
with
a
look
as
if
he
had
bought
the
other
soul
now
you
had
better
go
and
order
a
new
suit
but
i
want
you
to
order
it
at
a
military
tailor
so
that
they
will
supply
you
later
on
with
a
uniform

credit

do
want
hold
your
tongue
and
do
as
you
are
told

big
party

the
freedom

the
city
as
a
wholesale
merchant
oh
i
congratulate
you
hold
your
tongue
when
i
speaking
you
must
go
and
pay
a
call
now
with
your
deceitful
ways
your
unrivalled
capacity
for
talking
nonsense
you
have
succeeded
in
winning
the
good
graces
of
my
i
want
you
to
ask
her
what
she
thought
of
the
party
i
gave
on
sunday
last
did
you
hold
your
tongue
and
do
as
i
tell
you
she
be
jealous
and
ask
you
whether
you
were
present
of
course
you
were
for
there
was
no
party
you
both
express
discontent
become
good
friends
and
slander
me
i
know
you
an
expert
at
it
but
you
must
praise
my
wife
do
you
understand
no
not
quite
well
it
not
necessary
that
you
should
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
carry
out
my
orders
another
thing
tell
nyström
that
i
grown
so
proud
that
i
do
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
tell
him
that
straight
out
you
be
speaking
the
truth
for
once
no
hold
on
we
postpone
that
you
go
to
him
speak
of
the
importance
of
next
thursday
paint
for
him
the
great
advantages
the
many
benefits
the
brilliant
prospects
and
so
on
you
understand
me
i
understand
then
you
take
the
manuscript
to
the
printers
and
then
we
kick
him
out
if
you
like
to
call
it
that
i
have
no
objection
and
am
i
to
read
the
verses
to
your
guests
and
distribute
them
hm
yes
and
another
thing
try
to
meet
my
brother
find
out
all
you
can
about
his
circumstances
and
friends
make
up
to
him
worm
yourself
into
his
confidence
the
latter
an
easy
job
become
his
friend
tell
him
that
i
cheated
him
tell
him
that
i
am
proud
and
ask
him
how
much
he
take
for
changing
his
name
a
tinge
of
green
representing
a
blush
spread
over
levin
pale
face
that
ugly
he
said
what
and
besides
one
thing
more
i
a
business
man
and
i
like
order
in
all
my
transactions
i
guarantee
such
and
such
a
sum
i
must
pay
it
that
clear
oh
no
do
talk
rubbish
i
have
no
security
in
case
of
death
just
sign
this
bond
made
out
to
the
holder
and
payable
at
sight
it
merely
a
formality
at
the
word
a
slight
tremor
shook
levin
body
and
he
seized
the
pen
hesitatingly
although
he
well
knew
that
retreat
was
impossible
in
imagination
he
saw
a
row
of
shabby
spectacled
men
carrying
canes
in
their
hands
their
bulging
with
stamped
documents
he
heard
knocking
at
doors
running
on
stairs
summonses
threats
respite
he
heard
the
clock
on
the
town
hall
striking
as
the
men
shouldered
their
canes
and
led
him
with
clogged
feet
to
the
place
of
execution
where
he
himself
was
finally
released
but
where
his
honour
as
a
citizen
fell
under
the
executioner
axe
amid
the
delighted
shouts
of
the
crowd
he
signed
the
audience
was
over
chapter
x
the
newspaper
syndicate
grey
bonnet
for
forty
years
sweden
had
worked
for
the
right
which
every
man
obtains
when
he
comes
of
age
pamphlets
had
been
written
newspapers
founded
stones
thrown
suppers
eaten
and
speeches
made
meetings
had
been
held
petitions
had
been
presented
the
railways
had
been
used
hands
had
been
pressed
volunteer
regiments
had
been
formed
and
so
in
the
end
with
a
great
deal
of
noise
the
desired
object
had
been
attained
enthusiasm
was
great
and
justifiable
the
old
birchwood
tables
at
the
opera
restaurant
were
transformed
into
political
tribunes
the
fumes
of
the
attracted
many
a
politician
who
later
on
became
a
great
screamer
the
smell
of
reform
cigars
excited
many
an
ambitious
dream
which
was
never
realized
the
old
dust
was
washed
off
with
reform
soap
it
was
generally
believed
that
everything
would
be
right
now
and
after
the
tremendous
uproar
the
country
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
confidently
awaiting
the
brilliant
results
which
were
to
be
the
outcome
of
all
this
fuss
it
slept
for
a
few
years
and
when
it
awoke
it
was
faced
by
a
reality
which
suggested
a
miscalculation
there
were
murmurs
here
and
there
the
statesmen
who
had
recently
been
lauded
to
the
skies
were
now
criticized
there
were
even
among
the
students
some
who
discovered
that
the
whole
movement
had
originated
in
a
country
which
stood
in
very
close
relationship
to
the
promoter
of
the
bill
and
that
the
original
could
be
found
in
a
handbook
but
enough
of
it
characteristic
of
these
days
was
a
certain
embarrassment
which
soon
took
the
form
of
universal
discontent
or
as
it
was
called
opposition
but
it
was
a
new
kind
of
opposition
it
was
not
as
is
generally
the
case
directed
against
the
government
but
against
parliament
it
was
a
conservative
opposition
including
liberals
as
well
as
conservatives
young
men
as
well
as
old
there
was
much
misery
in
the
country
now
it
happened
that
the
newspaper
syndicate
born
and
grown
up
under
liberal
auspices
fell
asleep
when
it
was
called
upon
to
defend
unpopular
views
if
one
may
speak
of
the
views
of
a
syndicate
the
directors
proposed
at
the
general
meeting
that
certain
opinions
should
be
changed
as
they
had
the
effect
of
decreasing
the
number
of
subscribers
necessary
to
the
continuance
of
the
enterprise
the
general
meeting
agreed
to
the
proposition
and
the
became
a
conservative
paper
but
there
was
a
although
it
must
be
confessed
that
it
did
not
greatly
embarrass
the
syndicate
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
new
chief
editor
to
save
the
syndicate
from
ridicule
that
no
change
need
be
made
so
far
as
the
invisible
editorial
staff
was
concerned
went
without
saying
the
chief
editor
a
man
of
honour
tendered
his
resignation
the
editorial
management
which
had
long
been
abused
on
account
of
its
red
colour
accepted
it
with
pleasure
hoping
thereby
without
further
trouble
to
take
rank
as
a
better
class
paper
there
only
remained
the
necessity
of
finding
a
new
chief
editor
in
accordance
with
the
new
programme
of
the
syndicate
he
would
have
to
possess
the
following
qualifications
he
must
be
known
as
a
perfectly
trustworthy
citizen
must
belong
to
the
official
class
must
possess
a
title
usurped
or
won
which
could
be
elaborated
if
necessity
arose
in
addition
to
this
he
must
be
of
good
appearance
so
that
one
could
show
him
off
at
festivals
and
on
other
public
occasions
he
must
be
dependent
a
little
stupid
because
true
stupidity
always
goes
hand
in
hand
with
conservative
leanings
he
must
be
endowed
with
a
certain
amount
of
shrewdness
which
would
enable
him
to
know
intuitively
the
wishes
of
his
chiefs
and
never
let
him
forget
that
public
and
private
welfare
are
rightly
understood
one
and
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
he
must
not
be
too
young
because
an
older
man
is
more
easily
managed
and
finally
he
must
be
married
for
the
syndicate
which
consisted
of
business
men
knew
perfectly
well
that
married
slaves
are
more
amenable
than
unmarried
ones
the
individual
was
discovered
and
he
was
to
a
high
degree
endowed
with
all
the
characteristics
enumerated
he
was
a
strikingly
handsome
man
with
a
fairly
fine
figure
and
a
long
wavy
beard
hiding
all
the
weak
points
of
his
face
which
otherwise
would
have
given
him
away
his
large
full
deceitful
eyes
caught
the
casual
observer
and
inspired
his
confidence
which
was
then
unscrupulously
abused
his
somewhat
veiled
voice
always
speaking
words
of
love
of
peace
of
honour
and
above
all
of
patriotism
beguiled
many
a
misguided
listener
and
brought
him
to
the
punch
table
where
the
excellent
man
spent
his
evenings
preaching
straightforwardness
and
love
of
the
mother
country
the
influence
which
this
man
of
honour
exerted
on
his
evil
environment
was
marvellous
it
could
not
be
seen
but
it
could
be
heard
the
whole
pack
which
for
years
had
been
let
loose
on
everything
and
venerable
which
had
not
even
let
alone
the
higher
things
was
now
restrained
and
full
of
love
not
only
for
its
old
friends
was
now
and
not
merely
in
its
heart
moral
and
straightforward
they
carried
out
in
every
detail
the
programme
drawn
up
by
the
new
editor
on
his
accession
the
cardinal
points
of
which
expressed
in
a
few
words
were
to
persecute
all
good
ideas
if
they
were
new
to
fight
for
and
uphold
all
bad
ones
if
they
were
old
to
grovel
before
those
in
power
to
extol
all
those
on
whom
fortune
was
smiling
to
push
down
all
those
who
strove
to
rise
to
adore
success
and
abuse
misfortune
freely
translated
the
programme
read
to
acknowledge
and
cheer
only
the
tested
and
admittedly
good
to
work
against
the
mania
of
innovation
and
to
persecute
severely
but
justly
everybody
who
was
trying
to
get
on
by
dishonest
means
for
honest
work
only
should
be
crowned
with
success
the
secret
of
the
last
clause
which
the
editorial
staff
had
principally
at
heart
was
not
difficult
to
discover
the
staff
consisted
entirely
of
people
whose
hopes
had
been
disappointed
in
one
way
or
another
in
most
cases
by
their
own
fault
through
drinking
and
recklessness
some
of
them
were
college
geniuses
who
in
the
past
had
enjoyed
a
great
reputation
as
singers
speakers
poets
or
wits
and
had
then
justly
or
according
to
them
unjustly
been
forgotten
during
a
number
of
years
it
had
been
their
business
to
praise
and
promote
frequently
against
their
own
inclination
everything
that
was
new
all
the
enterprises
started
by
reformers
it
was
therefore
not
strange
that
now
they
seized
the
opportunity
to
attack
under
the
most
honourable
pretexts
everything
new
good
or
bad
the
chief
editor
in
particular
was
great
in
tracking
humbug
and
dishonesty
whenever
a
delegate
opposed
a
bill
which
tended
to
injure
the
interests
of
the
country
for
the
sake
of
the
party
he
was
immediately
taken
to
task
and
called
a
humbug
trying
to
be
original
longing
for
a
ministerial
he
did
not
say
portfolio
for
he
always
thought
of
clothes
first
politics
however
was
not
his
strong
or
rather
his
weak
point
but
literature
in
days
long
past
on
the
occasion
of
the
old
norse
festival
at
upsala
he
had
proposed
a
toast
in
verse
on
woman
and
thereby
furnished
an
important
contribution
to
the
literature
of
the
world
it
was
printed
in
as
many
provincial
papers
as
the
author
considered
necessary
for
his
immortality
this
had
made
him
a
poet
and
when
he
had
taken
his
degrees
he
bought
a
ticket
to
stockholm
in
order
to
make
his
début
in
the
world
and
receive
his
due
unfortunately
the
stockholmers
do
not
read
provincial
papers
the
young
man
was
unknown
and
his
talent
was
not
appreciated
as
he
was
a
shrewd
man
his
small
brain
had
never
been
exuberantly
imaginative
he
concealed
his
wound
and
allowed
it
to
become
the
secret
of
his
life
the
bitterness
engendered
by
the
fact
that
his
honest
work
as
he
called
it
remained
unrewarded
specially
qualified
him
for
the
post
of
a
literary
censor
but
he
did
not
write
himself
his
position
did
not
allow
him
to
indulge
in
efforts
of
his
own
and
he
preferred
leaving
it
to
the
reviewer
who
criticized
everybody
work
justly
and
with
inflexible
severity
the
reviewer
had
written
poetry
for
the
last
sixteen
years
under
a
pseudonym
nobody
had
ever
read
his
verses
and
nobody
had
taken
the
trouble
to
discover
the
author
real
name
but
every
christmas
his
verses
were
exhumed
and
praised
in
the
by
a
third
party
of
course
who
signed
his
article
so
that
the
public
should
not
suspect
that
the
author
had
written
it
himself
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
the
author
was
known
to
the
public
in
the
seventeenth
year
the
author
considered
it
advisable
to
put
his
name
to
a
new
book
a
new
edition
of
an
old
one
as
misfortune
would
have
it
the
the
whole
staff
of
which
was
composed
of
young
people
who
had
never
heard
the
real
name
treated
the
author
as
a
beginner
and
expressed
astonishment
not
only
that
a
young
writer
should
put
his
name
to
his
first
book
but
also
that
a
young
man
book
could
be
so
monotonous
and
this
was
a
hard
blow
the
old
pseudonymus
fell
ill
with
fever
but
recovered
after
having
been
brilliantly
rehabilitated
by
the
the
latter
went
for
the
whole
reading
public
in
a
lump
charging
it
with
being
immoral
and
dishonest
unable
to
appreciate
an
honest
sound
and
moral
book
which
could
safely
be
put
into
the
hands
of
a
child
a
comic
paper
made
fun
of
the
last
point
so
that
the
pseudonymus
had
a
relapse
and
on
his
second
recovery
vowed
annihilation
to
all
native
literature
which
might
appear
in
future
it
did
however
not
apply
to
quite
all
native
literature
for
a
shrewd
observer
would
have
noticed
that
the
frequently
praised
bad
books
true
it
was
often
done
lamely
and
in
terms
which
could
be
read
in
two
ways
the
same
shrewd
observer
could
have
noticed
that
the
miserable
stuff
in
question
was
always
published
by
the
same
firm
but
this
did
not
necessarily
imply
that
the
reviewer
was
influenced
by
extraneous
circumstances
such
as
little
lunches
for
instance
he
and
the
whole
editorial
staff
were
upright
men
who
would
surely
not
have
dared
to
judge
others
with
so
much
severity
if
they
themselves
had
not
been
men
of
irreproachable
character
another
important
member
of
the
staff
was
the
dramatic
critic
he
had
received
his
education
and
qualified
at
a
recruiting
bureau
in
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
star
who
was
only
a
star
in
as
he
was
not
sufficiently
enlightened
to
differentiate
between
a
private
opinion
and
a
universal
verdict
it
happened
to
him
when
he
was
for
the
first
time
let
loose
in
the
columns
of
the
that
he
slated
the
greatest
actress
in
sweden
and
maintained
that
she
copied
miss
whatever
her
name
was
that
it
was
done
very
clumsily
goes
without
saying
and
also
that
it
happened
before
the
had
veered
round
all
this
made
his
name
detested
and
despised
but
still
he
had
a
name
and
that
compensated
him
for
the
indignation
he
excited
one
of
his
cardinal
points
although
not
at
once
appreciated
was
his
deafness
several
years
went
by
before
it
was
discovered
and
even
then
nobody
could
tell
whether
or
no
it
had
any
connexion
with
a
certain
encounter
caused
by
one
of
his
notices
in
the
foyer
of
the
opera
house
one
evening
after
the
lights
had
been
turned
down
after
this
encounter
he
tested
the
strength
of
his
arm
only
on
quite
young
people
and
anybody
familiar
with
the
circumstances
could
tell
by
his
critique
when
he
had
had
an
accident
in
the
wings
for
the
conceited
provincial
had
read
somewhere
the
unreliable
statement
that
stockholm
was
another
paris
and
had
believed
it
the
art
critic
was
an
old
academician
who
had
never
held
a
brush
in
his
hand
but
was
a
member
of
the
brilliant
artists
club
minerva
a
fact
which
enabled
him
to
describe
works
of
art
in
the
columns
of
his
paper
before
they
were
finished
thereby
saving
the
reader
the
trouble
of
forming
an
opinion
of
his
own
he
was
invariably
kind
to
his
acquaintances
and
in
criticizing
an
exhibition
never
forgot
to
mention
every
single
one
of
them
his
practice
of
many
years
standing
of
saying
something
pretty
about
everybody
and
how
would
he
have
dared
to
do
otherwise
made
it
child
play
to
him
to
mention
twenty
names
in
half
a
column
in
reading
his
reviews
one
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
popular
game
pictures
and
devices
but
the
young
artists
he
always
conscientiously
forgot
so
that
the
public
which
for
ten
years
had
heard
none
but
the
old
names
began
to
despair
of
the
future
of
art
one
exception
however
he
had
made
and
made
quite
recently
in
an
unpropitious
hour
and
in
consequence
of
this
exception
there
was
great
excitement
one
morning
in
the
editorial
office
of
the
what
had
occurred
was
this
sellén
the
reader
may
remember
this
insignificant
name
mentioned
on
a
former
and
not
a
particularly
important
occasion
had
arrived
with
his
picture
at
the
exhibition
at
the
very
last
moment
when
it
had
been
hung
in
the
worst
possible
place
for
the
artist
was
neither
a
member
of
the
academy
nor
did
he
possess
the
royal
medal
the
professor
of
charles
ix
arrived
he
had
been
given
this
nickname
because
he
never
painted
anything
but
scenes
from
the
life
of
charles
ix
the
reason
again
for
this
was
that
a
long
time
ago
he
had
bought
at
an
auction
a
wine
glass
a
tablecloth
a
chair
and
a
parchment
from
the
period
of
charles
ix
these
objects
he
had
painted
for
twenty
years
sometimes
with
sometimes
without
the
king
but
he
was
a
professor
now
and
a
knight
of
many
orders
and
so
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
was
with
the
academician
when
his
eye
fell
on
the
silent
man
of
the
opposition
and
his
picture
here
again
sir
he
put
up
his
and
this
then
is
the
new
style
hm
let
me
tell
you
sir
believe
the
word
of
an
old
man
take
that
picture
away
take
it
away
it
makes
me
sick
to
look
at
it
you
do
yourself
the
greatest
service
if
you
take
it
away
what
do
you
say
old
fellow
the
old
fellow
said
that
the
exhibition
of
such
a
picture
was
an
impertinence
and
that
if
the
gentleman
would
take
his
kindly
meant
advice
he
would
change
his
profession
and
become
a
painter
sellén
replied
mildly
but
shrewdly
that
there
were
so
many
able
people
in
that
profession
that
he
had
chosen
an
artistic
career
where
success
could
be
obtained
far
more
easily
as
had
been
proved
the
professor
was
furious
at
this
insolence
he
turned
his
back
on
the
contrite
sellén
with
a
threat
which
the
academician
translated
into
a
promise
the
enlightened
committee
of
purchases
had
met
behind
closed
doors
when
the
doors
were
opened
again
six
pictures
had
been
bought
for
the
money
subscribed
by
the
public
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
native
artists
the
excerpt
from
the
minutes
which
found
its
way
into
the
columns
of
the
newspapers
was
worded
as
follows
the
art
union
yesterday
bought
the
following
pictures
with
oxen
landscape
by
the
wholesale
merchant
adolphus
at
the
fire
of
magdeburg
historical
painting
by
the
linen
draper
child
blowing
its
nose
by
lieutenant
bore
in
the
harbour
marine
picture
by
the
shipbroker
scene
with
women
landscape
by
the
royal
secretary
o
with
mushrooms
by
the
actor
these
works
of
art
which
cost
a
thousand
pounds
each
on
an
average
were
afterwards
praised
in
the
in
two
columns
at
fifteen
crowns
each
that
was
nothing
extraordinary
but
the
critic
partly
in
order
to
fill
up
the
space
and
partly
in
order
to
seize
the
right
moment
for
suppressing
a
growing
evil
attacked
a
bad
custom
which
was
beginning
to
creep
in
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
young
unknown
adventurers
who
had
run
away
from
the
academy
without
study
were
trying
to
pervert
the
sound
judgment
of
the
public
by
a
mere
running
after
effect
and
then
sellén
was
taken
by
the
ears
and
flogged
so
that
even
his
enemies
found
that
his
treatment
was
unfair
and
that
means
a
great
deal
not
only
was
he
denied
every
trace
of
talent
and
his
art
called
humbug
even
his
private
circumstances
were
dragged
before
the
public
the
article
hinted
at
cheap
restaurants
where
he
was
obliged
to
dine
at
the
shabby
clothes
he
was
forced
to
wear
at
his
loose
morals
his
idleness
it
concluded
by
prophesying
in
the
name
of
religion
and
morality
that
he
would
end
his
days
in
a
public
institution
unless
he
mended
his
ways
while
there
was
yet
time
it
was
a
disgraceful
act
committed
in
indifference
and
selfishness
and
it
was
little
less
than
a
miracle
that
a
soul
was
not
lost
on
the
night
of
the
publication
of
that
particular
number
of
the
hours
later
the
appeared
it
reflected
on
the
way
in
which
public
moneys
were
administered
by
a
certain
clique
and
mentioned
the
fact
that
at
the
last
purchase
of
pictures
not
a
single
one
had
been
bought
which
had
been
painted
by
an
artist
but
that
the
perpetrators
had
been
officials
and
tradesmen
impudent
enough
to
compete
with
the
artists
although
the
latter
had
no
other
market
it
went
on
to
say
that
these
pirates
lowered
the
standard
and
demoralized
the
artists
whose
sole
endeavour
would
have
to
be
to
paint
as
badly
as
they
did
if
they
did
not
want
to
starve
then
sellén
name
was
mentioned
his
picture
was
the
first
soulfully
conceived
work
within
the
last
ten
years
for
ten
years
art
had
been
a
mere
affair
of
colours
and
brushes
sellén
picture
was
an
honest
piece
of
work
full
of
inspiration
and
devotion
and
entirely
original
a
picture
which
could
only
have
been
produced
by
an
artist
who
had
met
the
spirit
of
nature
face
to
face
the
critic
enjoined
the
young
artist
to
fight
against
the
ancients
whom
he
had
already
left
a
long
way
behind
and
exhorted
him
to
have
faith
and
hope
because
he
had
a
mission
to
fulfil
etc
the
foamed
with
rage
you
see
that
that
fellow
will
have
success
exclaimed
the
chief
editor
why
the
devil
did
we
slate
him
quite
so
much
supposing
he
became
a
success
now
we
should
cover
ourselves
with
ridicule
the
academician
vowed
that
he
should
not
have
any
success
went
home
with
a
troubled
heart
referred
to
his
books
and
wrote
an
essay
in
which
he
proved
that
sellén
art
was
humbug
and
that
the
had
been
corrupted
the
drew
a
breath
of
relief
but
immediately
afterwards
it
received
a
fresh
blow
on
the
following
day
the
morning
papers
announced
the
fact
that
his
majesty
had
bought
sellén
masterly
landscape
which
for
days
had
drawn
a
large
public
to
the
exhibition
the
received
the
full
fury
of
the
gale
it
was
tossed
hither
and
thither
and
fluttered
like
a
rag
on
a
pole
should
they
veer
round
or
steer
ahead
both
paper
and
critic
were
involved
the
chief
editor
decided
by
order
of
the
managing
director
to
sacrifice
the
critic
and
save
the
paper
but
how
was
it
to
be
done
in
their
extremity
they
remembered
struve
he
was
a
man
completely
at
home
in
the
maze
of
publicity
he
was
sent
for
the
situation
was
clear
to
him
in
a
moment
and
he
promised
that
in
a
very
few
days
the
barge
should
be
able
to
tack
to
understand
struve
scheme
it
is
necessary
to
know
the
most
important
data
of
his
biography
he
was
a
born
student
driven
to
journalism
by
sheer
poverty
he
started
his
career
as
editor
of
the
socialist
next
he
belonged
to
the
conservative
but
when
the
latter
removed
to
the
provinces
with
inventory
printing
plant
and
editor
the
name
was
changed
into
and
its
politics
changed
accordingly
struve
was
sold
to
the
where
his
knowledge
of
all
the
conservative
tricks
stood
him
in
good
stead
in
the
same
way
his
greatest
merit
in
the
eyes
of
the
was
his
knowledge
of
all
the
secrets
of
their
deadly
foe
the
and
his
readiness
to
abuse
his
knowledge
of
them
struve
began
the
work
of
whitewashing
by
starting
a
correspondence
in
the
a
few
lines
of
this
mentioning
the
rush
of
visitors
to
the
exhibition
were
reprinted
in
the
next
there
appeared
in
the
an
attack
on
the
academician
this
attack
was
followed
by
a
few
reassuring
words
signed
the
ed
which
read
as
follows
although
we
never
shared
the
opinion
of
our
art
critic
with
regard
to
sellén
justly
praised
landscape
yet
we
can
not
altogether
agree
with
the
judgment
of
our
respected
correspondent
but
as
on
principle
we
open
our
columns
to
all
opinions
we
unhesitatingly
printed
the
above
article
the
ice
was
broken
struve
who
had
the
reputation
of
having
written
on
every
subject
except
cufic
coins
now
wrote
a
brilliant
critique
of
sellén
picture
and
signed
it
very
characteristically
dixi
the
was
saved
and
so
of
course
was
sellén
but
the
latter
was
of
minor
importance
chapter
xi
happy
people
it
was
seven
in
the
evening
the
band
at
berns
was
playing
the
wedding
march
from
a
midsummer
night
dream
when
to
the
accompaniment
of
its
inspiriting
strains
olle
montanus
made
his
entry
into
the
red
room
none
of
the
members
had
yet
arrived
olle
looked
imposing
for
the
first
time
since
his
confirmation
he
was
wearing
a
high
hat
he
was
dressed
in
a
new
suit
and
his
boots
were
without
holes
he
had
had
a
bath
had
been
newly
shaved
and
his
hair
was
waved
as
if
he
were
going
to
a
wedding
a
heavy
brass
chain
ornamented
his
waistcoat
and
his
left
waistcoat
pocket
bulged
visibly
a
sunny
smile
lit
up
his
features
he
radiated
kindness
one
might
have
thought
that
he
wanted
to
help
all
the
world
with
little
loans
taking
off
his
overcoat
no
longer
cautiously
buttoned
up
he
took
the
centre
of
the
sofa
in
the
background
opened
his
coat
and
tugged
at
his
white
shirt
front
so
that
it
rose
with
a
crackle
and
stood
out
like
an
arch
at
every
movement
the
lining
of
his
waistcoat
and
trousers
creaked
this
seemed
to
give
him
as
much
pleasure
as
the
knocking
of
his
boot
against
the
leg
of
the
sofa
he
pulled
out
his
watch
his
dear
old
turnip
which
for
a
year
and
a
month
grace
had
been
in
the
hands
and
the
two
old
friends
both
seemed
to
enjoy
its
liberty
what
had
happened
that
this
poor
fellow
should
be
so
inexpressibly
happy
we
know
that
he
had
not
drawn
the
winner
in
a
lottery
that
he
had
not
inherited
a
fortune
that
he
had
not
been
honourably
mentioned
that
he
had
not
won
the
sweet
happiness
which
baffles
description
what
had
happened
then
something
very
commonplace
he
had
found

sellén
was
the
next
to
arrive
he
wore
a
velvet
jacket
and
boots
he
carried
a
rug
a
on

and
a
cane
a
yellow
silk
handkerchief
was
knotted
round
his
throat
his
hands
were
covered
by
gloves
and
a
flower
blossomed
in
his
buttonhole
he
was
as
usual
cheerful
and
calm
his
lean
intelligent
face
betrayed
no
trace
of
the
emotions
undergone
during
the
last
few
days
sellén
was
accompanied
by
rehnhjelm
the
lad
was
unusually
subdued
he
knew
that
his
friend
and
patron
was
leaving
him
hallo
sellén
said
olle
you
are
happy
at
last
are
you
old
chap
happy
what
nonsense
you
are
talking
i
sold
a
piece
of
work
the
first
in
five
years
is
that
so
overwhelming
but
you
must
have
read
the
papers
your
name
made
oh
i
do
care
the
toss
of
a
button
for
that
do
imagine
that
i
care
for
such
trifles
i
know
exactly
how
much
i
still
have
to
learn
before
i
shall
be
anybody
let
talk
of
it
again
in
ten
years
time
olle
olle
believed
half
of
what
sellén
said
and
doubted
the
rest
his
shirt
front
crackled
and
the
lining
creaked
so
that
sellén
attention
was
aroused
by
the
lord
harry
he
burst
out
you
are
magnificent
think
so
you
look
like
a
lion
sellén
rapped
his
boots
with
his
cane
shyly
smelt
the
flower
in
his
buttonhole
and
looked
indifferent
olle
pulled
out
his
watch
to
see
whether
it
was
not
yet
time
for
lundell
to
arrive
which
gave
sellén
an
opportunity
of
sweeping
the
galleries
with
his
olle
was
permitted
to
feel
the
soft
texture
of
the
velvet
coat
while
sellén
assured
him
that
it
was
an
exceptionally
good
quality
at
the
price
olle
could
not
resist
asking
the
cost
sellén
told
him
and
admired
olle
studs
which
were
made
of
shells
presently
lundell
appeared
he
too
had
been
given
a
bone
at
the
great
banquet
he
was
commissioned
to
paint
the
for
the
church
of
träskola
for
a
small
sum
but
this
had
not
visibly
affected
his
outward
appearance
unless
indeed
his
fat
cheeks
and
beaming
face
hinted
at
a
more
generous
diet
falk
was
with
lundell
he
was
grave
but
he
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
the
whole
world
sincerely
rejoiced
that
merit
had
found
its
just
reward
congratulations
sellén
he
said
but
it
no
more
than
your
due
sellén
agreed
i
have
been
painting
just
as
well
these
last
five
years
and
all
the
world
has
jeered
they
were
still
jeering
the
day
before
yesterday
but
now
it
disgusting
look
at
this
letter
which
i
received
from
the
idiot
the
professor
of
charles
ix
all
eyes
opened
wide
and
became
keen
for
it
is
gratifying
to
examine
the
oppressor
closely
have
him
on
paper
at
least
in
one
hands
at
one
mercy
dear
sellén
fancy
that
me
welcome
you
among
us
he
afraid
of
me
the
blackguard
have
always
appreciated
your
talent
the
liar
let
tear
up
the
rag
and
forget
all
about
him
sellén
invited
his
friends
to
drink
he
drank
to
falk
and
hoped
that
his
pen
would
soon
bring
him
to
the
front
falk
became
blushed
and
promised
to
do
his
best
when
his
time
came
but
he
was
afraid
that
his
apprenticeship
would
be
a
long
one
and
he
begged
his
friends
not
to
lose
patience
with
him
if
he
tarried
he
thanked
sellén
for
his
friendship
which
had
taught
him
endurance
and
renunciation
sellén
begged
him
not
to
talk
nonsense
where
was
the
merit
of
endurance
when
there
was
no
other
alternative
and
where
was
the
virtue
in
renouncing
what
one
had
no
chance
of
obtaining
but
olle
smiled
a
kindly
smile
and
his
shirt
front
swelled
with
pleasure
so
that
the
red
braces
could
be
plainly
seen
he
drank
to
lundell
and
implored
him
to
take
an
example
from
sellén
and
not
forget
the
land
of
promise
in
lingering
over
the
fleshpots
of
egypt
he
assured
him
that
his
friend
olle
believed
in
his
talent
that
was
to
say
when
he
was
himself
and
painted
according
to
his
own
light
but
whenever
he
humbugged
and
painted
to
please
others
he
was
worse
than
the
rest
therefore
he
should
look
upon
the
as
a
pot
boiler
which
would
put
him
into
a
position
to
follow
his
own
inspiration
in
art
falk
tried
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
finding
out
what
olle
thought
of
himself
and
his
own
art
a
puzzle
which
he
had
long
vainly
attempted
to
solve
when
ygberg
walked
into
the
red
room
everybody
eagerly
invited
him
to
be
his
guest
for
he
had
been
forgotten
during
the
last
hot
days
and
everyone
was
anxious
to
show
him
that
it
had
not
been
out
of
selfishness
but
olle
searched
in
his
right
waistcoat
pocket
and
with
a
movement
which
he
was
anxious
to
hide
from
all
eyes
he
slipped
a
banknote
into
ygberg
coat
pocket
the
latter
understood
and
acknowledged
it
by
a
grateful
look
ygberg
drank
to
sellén
he
said
that
one
might
consider
in
one
way
that
sellén
fortune
was
made
but
on
the
other
hand
one
might
consider
with
equal
justification
that
it
was
not
so
sellén
was
not
sufficiently
developed
he
still
wanted
many
years
study
for
art
was
long
as
he
ygberg
had
himself
experienced
he
had
had
nothing
but
therefore
nobody
could
suspect
him
of
envying
a
man
of
sellén
reputation
the
envy
which
peered
through
ygberg
words
slightly
clouded
the
sunny
sky
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
for
everybody
realized
that
the
bitterness
of
a
long
wasted
life
must
be
held
responsible
for
it
all
the
more
gladly
ygberg
handed
falk
a
small
newly
printed
essay
on
the
cover
of
which
he
beheld
with
consternation
the
black
portrait
of
ulrica
eleonora
ygberg
stated
that
he
had
delivered
the
manuscript
on
the
day
stipulated
smith
had
taken
falk
refusal
with
the
greatest
calm
and
was
now
printing
falk
poems
to
falk
eyes
the
lost
their
brilliancy
he
sat
plunged
in
deep
thought
his
heart
was
too
full
to
find
vent
in
words
his
poems
were
to
be
printed
at
smith
expense
this
was
proof
that
they
were
not
without
merit
the
thought
was
sufficient
food
for
the
whole
evening
the
evening
passed
quickly
for
the
happy
circle
the
band
ceased
playing
and
the
light
was
turned
out
they
were
obliged
to
leave
but
finding
the
night
far
too
young
for
breaking
up
they
strolled
along
the
quays
amid
endless
conversation
and
philosophical
discussions
until
they
were
tired
and
thirsty
lundell
offered
to
take
his
friends
to
see
marie
where
they
could
have
some
beer
they
turned
towards
the
north
and
came
to
a
street
which
gave
on
a
fence
the
fence
enclosed
a
tobacco
field
bordering
on
the
open
country
they
stopped
before
a
with
a
gable
facing
the
street
from
above
the
door
grinned
two
sandstone
faces
whose
ears
and
shins
were
lost
in
fantastic
scrolls
between
the
heads
hung
a
sword
and
an
axe
it
was
formerly
the
house
of
the
executioner
lundell
apparently
quite
familiar
with
the
neighbourhood
gave
a
signal
before
one
of
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
the
blind
was
drawn
up
the
window
opened
and
a
woman
head
looked
out
a
voice
asked
whether
the
caller
was
albert
no
sooner
had
lundell
owned
to
this
his
de
than
a
girl
opened
the
door
and
on
the
promise
of
silence
admitted
the
party
as
the
promise
was
readily
given
the
red
room
was
soon
in
her
apartment
and
introduced
to
her
under
fictitious
names
the
room
was
not
a
large
one
it
had
once
been
the
kitchen
and
the
range
was
still
standing
in
its
place
the
furniture
consisted
of
a
chest
of
drawers
of
a
pattern
usually
found
in
servants
rooms
on
the
drawers
stood
a
swathed
in
a
piece
of
white
muslin
above
the
glass
hung
a
coloured
lithograph
representing
the
saviour
on
the
cross
the
chest
was
littered
with
small
china
figures
scent
bottles
a
prayer
book
and
an
ash
tray
and
with
its
and
two
lighted
tallow
candles
seemed
to
form
a
little
house
altar
charles
xv
surrounded
by
newspaper
cuttings
mostly
representing
police
constables
those
enemies
of
the
magdalenes
was
riding
on
horseback
on
the
wall
above
the
folding
sofa
which
had
not
yet
been
converted
into
a
bed
on
the
stood
a
stunted
fuchsia
a
geranium
and
a
myrtle
the
proud
tree
of
aphrodite
in
the
poor
dwelling
a
photograph
album
lay
on
the
on
the
first
leaf
was
a
picture
of
the
king
on
the
second
and
third
papa
and
mamma
poor
country
folk
on
the
fourth
a
student
the
seducer
on
the
fifth
a
baby
and
on
the
sixth
the
fiancé
a
journeyman
this
was
her
history
so
like
the
history
of
most
of
them
on
a
nail
close
to
the
range
hung
an
elegant
dress
a
velvet
cloak
and
a
hat
with
feathers
the
fairy
disguise
in
which
she
went
out
to
catch
young
men
the
fairy
herself
was
a
tall
ordinary
looking
young
woman
of
recklessness
and
vigils
had
given
her
face
that
white
transparency
which
as
a
rule
distinguishes
the
untoiling
rich
but
her
hands
still
showed
traces
of
hard
work
in
her
pretty
with
her
flowing
hair
down
her
back
she
was
the
picture
of
a
magdalene
her
manner
was
comparatively
shy
but
she
was
merry
and
courteous
and
on
her
best
behaviour
the
party
split
up
into
groups
continued
the
interrupted
discussions
and
started
fresh
ones
falk
who
now
looked
upon
himself
as
a
poet
and
was
determined
to
be
interested
in
everything
be
it
ever
so
banal
began
a
sentimental
conversation
with
marie
which
she
greatly
enjoyed
for
she
appreciated
the
honour
of
being
treated
like
a
human
being
as
usual
the
talk
drifted
to
her
story
and
the
motives
which
had
shaped
her
career
she
did
not
lay
stress
on
her
first
slip
that
was
hardly
worth
speaking
about
but
all
the
blacker
was
her
account
of
the
time
she
had
spent
as
a
servant
leading
the
life
of
a
slave
made
miserable
by
the
whims
and
scoldings
of
an
indolent
mistress
a
life
of
toil
no
the
free
life
she
was
leading
now
was
far
preferable
but
when
you
are
tired
of
it
then
i
shall
marry
vestergren
does
he
want
you
he
looking
forward
to
the
day
moreover
i
am
going
to
open
a
little
shop
with
the
money
i
have
saved
but
so
many
have
asked
me
that
question
you
got
any
cigars
oh
yes
here
you
are
but
do
you
mind
my
talking
about
it
he
took
the
album
and
pointed
out
the
student
it
is
always
a
student
with
a
white
handkerchief
round
his
neck
a
white
student
hat
on
his
knees
and
a
gauche
manner
who
plays
mephisto
who
is
this
he
was
a
nice
fellow
the
seducer
what
oh
let
it
alone
i
was
every
bit
as
much
to
blame
and
it
is
always
so
my
dear
both
are
to
blame
look
this
is
my
baby
the
lord
took
it
and
i
dare
say
it
was
for
the
best
but
now
let
talk
about
something
else
who
is
that
gay
dog
whom
albert
has
brought
here
the
one
closest
to
the
stove
by
the
side
of
the
tall
one
whose
head
reaches
up
to
the
chimney
olle
very
much
flattered
by
her
attention
patted
his
wavy
hair
which
after
the
many
libations
was
beginning
to
stand
up
again
that
is
assistant
preacher
monsson
said
lundell
ugh
a
clergyman
i
might
have
known
it
from
the
cunning
look
in
his
eyes
do
you
know
that
a
clergyman
came
here
last
week
come
here
monsson
and
let
me
look
at
you
olle
descended
from
his
seat
where
he
and
ygberg
had
been
criticizing
kant
categorical
imperative
he
was
so
accustomed
to
exciting
the
curiosity
of
the
sex
that
he
immediately
felt
younger
he
lurched
towards
the
lady
whom
he
had
already
ogled
and
found
charming
twirling
his
moustache
he
asked
in
an
affected
voice
with
a
bow
which
he
had
not
learned
at
a
dancing
class
do
you
really
think
miss
that
i
look
like
a
clergyman
no
i
see
now
that
you
have
a
moustache
your
clothes
are
too
clean
for
an
artisan
may
i
see
your
hand
oh
you
are
a
smith
olle
was
deeply
hurt
am
i
so
very
ugly
miss
he
asked
pathetically
marie
examined
him
for
a
moment
you
are
very
plain
she
said
but
you
look
nice
oh
dear
lady
if
you
only
knew
how
you
are
hurting
me
i
have
never
yet
found
a
woman
ready
to
love
me
and
yet
i
have
met
so
many
who
found
happiness
although
they
were
plainer
than
i
am
but
woman
is
a
cursed
riddle
which
nobody
can
solve
i
detest
her
that
right
olle
came
a
voice
from
the
chimney
where
head
was
that
all
right
olle
was
going
back
to
the
stove
but
he
had
touched
on
a
topic
which
interested
marie
too
much
to
allow
it
to
drop
he
had
played
on
a
string
the
sound
of
which
she
knew
she
sat
down
by
his
side
and
soon
they
were
deep
in
a
and
grave
discussion
on
love
and
women
rehnhjelm
who
during
the
whole
evening
had
been
more
quiet
and
restrained
than
usual
and
of
whom
nobody
could
make
anything
suddenly
revived
and
was
now
sitting
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
near
falk
obviously
something
was
troubling
him
something
which
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
mention
he
seized
his
rapped
on
the
table
as
if
he
wanted
to
make
a
speech
and
when
those
nearest
to
him
looked
up
ready
to
listen
to
him
he
said
in
a
tremulous
and
indifferent
voice
gentlemen
you
think
i
am
a
beast
i
know
falk
i
know
you
think
me
a
fool
but
you
shall
see
friends
the
devil
take
me
you
shall
see
he
raised
his
voice
and
put
his
down
with
such
determination
that
it
broke
in
pieces
after
which
he
sank
back
on
the
sofa
and
fell
asleep
this
scene
although
not
an
uncommon
one
had
attracted
attention
she
dropped
the
conversation
with
olle
who
moreover
had
begun
to
stray
from
the
purely
abstract
point
of
the
question
and
rose
oh
what
a
pretty
boy
she
exclaimed
how
does
he
come
to
be
with
you
poor
little
chap
how
sleepy
he
is
i
had
seen
him
before
she
pushed
a
cushion
under
his
head
and
covered
him
with
a
shawl
how
small
his
hands
are
far
smaller
than
yours
you
country
louts
and
what
a
face
how
innocent
he
looks
albert
did
you
make
him
drink
so
much
whether
it
had
been
lundell
or
another
was
a
matter
of
no
importance
now
the
man
was
drunk
but
it
also
was
a
fact
that
he
did
not
need
any
urging
to
drink
he
was
consumed
by
a
constant
longing
to
still
an
inner
restlessness
which
seemed
to
drive
him
away
from
his
work
the
remarks
made
by
his
pretty
friend
had
not
perturbed
lundell
but
now
his
increasing
intoxication
excited
his
religious
feelings
which
had
been
blunted
by
a
luxurious
supper
and
as
the
intoxication
began
to
be
general
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
remind
his
companions
of
the
significance
of
the
day
and
the
impending
he
rose
filled
his
glass
steadied
himself
against
the
chest
of
drawers
and
claimed
the
attention
of
the
party
gentlemen
he
remembered
magdalene
presence
and
ladies
we
have
eaten
and
drunk
with
to
come
to
the
point
an
intent
which
if
we
set
aside
the
material
which
is
nothing
but
the
low
sensual
animal
component
of
our
nature
that
in
a
moment
like
this
when
the
hour
of
parting
is
imminent
we
have
here
a
distressing
example
of
the
vice
which
we
call
drunkenness
doubtless
it
arouses
all
religious
emotion
if
after
an
evening
spent
in
a
circle
of
friends
one
feels
moved
to
propose
a
glass
to
him
who
has
shown
more
than
ordinary
talent
i
am
speaking
of
sellén
one
should
think
that
should
to
a
certain
extent
prevail
such
an
example
i
maintain
has
been
manifested
here
in
higher
potency
and
therefore
i
am
reminded
of
the
beautiful
words
which
will
never
cease
ringing
in
my
ears
as
long
as
i
am
able
to
think
and
i
am
convinced
they
are
now
in
the
mind
of
each
one
of
us
although
this
spot
is
anything
but
suitable
this
young
man
who
has
fallen
a
victim
to
the
vice
which
we
will
call
drunkenness
has
unfortunately
crept
into
our
circle
and
to
cut
my
speech
short
matured
a
sadder
result
than
anybody
could
have
expected
your
health
noble
friend
sellén
i
wish
you
all
the
happiness
which
your
noble
heart
deserves
your
health
olle
montanus
falk
too
has
a
noble
heart
and
will
come
to
the
front
when
his
religious
sense
has
acquired
the
vigour
which
his
character
foreshadows
i
wo
mention
ygberg
for
he
has
at
last
come
to
a
decision
and
we
wish
him
luck
in
the
career
upon
which
he
has
so
splendidly
entered
the
philosophical
career
it
is
a
difficult
one
and
i
repeat
the
words
of
the
psalmist
who
can
tell
at
the
same
time
we
have
every
reason
to
hope
for
the
best
in
the
future
and
i
believe
that
we
can
count
on
it
as
long
as
our
sentiments
are
noble
and
our
hearts
are
not
striving
for
worldly
gain
for
gentlemen
a
man
without
religion
is
a
beast
i
therefore
ask
every
gentleman
here
present
to
raise
his
glass
and
empty
it
to
all
that
is
noble
beautiful
and
splendid
and
for
which
we
are
striving
your
health
gentlemen
religious
emotion
now
overwhelmed
lundell
to
such
a
degree
that
it
was
thought
best
to
break
up
the
party
daylight
had
been
shining
through
the
for
some
time
and
the
landscape
with
the
castle
and
the
maiden
stood
out
brilliantly
in
the
first
radiance
of
the
morning
sun
when
the
blind
was
drawn
up
day
rushed
in
and
illuminated
the
faces
of
those
nearest
the
window
they
were
deadly
pale
the
red
light
of
the
tallow
candles
fell
with
magnificent
effect
on
the
face
of
ygberg
who
was
sitting
on
the
stove
clutching
his
glass
olle
was
proposing
toasts
to
women
the
spring
the
sun
the
universe
throwing
open
the
window
to
give
vent
to
his
feelings
the
sleepers
were
roused
the
party
took
their
leave
of
marie
and
filed
through
the
front
door
when
they
had
reached
the
street
falk
turned
round
magdalene
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
the
rays
of
the
sun
fell
on
her
pale
face
her
long
black
hair
which
shone
deep
red
in
the
sunlight
seemed
to
trickle
down
her
throat
and
over
her
shoulders
and
to
be
falling
on
the
street
in
little
streams
above
her
head
hung
the
sword
and
the
axe
and
the
two
grinning
faces
but
in
an
apple
tree
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
perched
a
black
and
white
and
sang
its
frenzied
song
of
joy
that
the
night
was
over
chapter
xii
marine
insurance
society
triton
levi
was
a
young
man
born
and
educated
for
business
and
on
the
point
of
establishing
himself
with
the
assistance
of
his
wealthy
father
when
the
latter
died
leaving
nothing
but
a
family
totally
unprovided
for
this
was
a
great
disappointment
to
the
young
man
he
had
reached
an
age
when
he
considered
that
he
might
stop
working
altogether
and
let
others
toil
for
him
he
was
and
of
good
appearance
and
lean
in
the
flank
his
body
seemed
specially
adapted
for
wearing
a
in
the
manner
which
he
had
much
admired
in
certain
foreign
diplomatists
nature
had
arched
his
chest
in
the
most
elegant
fashion
so
that
he
was
capable
of
setting
off
to
the
fullest
advantage
a
shirt
front
even
in
the
very
act
of
sinking
into
an
easy
chair
at
the
foot
of
a
long
occupied
by
the
whole
administrative
committee
a
beautiful
beard
parted
in
the
middle
gave
his
young
face
a
sympathetic
and
trustworthy
expression
his
small
feet
were
made
for
walking
on
the
brussels
carpet
of
a
and
his
carefully
manicured
hands
were
particularly
suitable
for
very
light
work
such
as
the
signing
of
his
name
preferably
on
a
printed
circular
in
the
days
which
are
now
called
the
good
days
although
in
reality
they
were
very
bad
ones
for
a
good
many
people
the
greatest
discovery
of
a
great
century
was
made
namely
that
one
could
live
more
cheaply
and
better
on
other
people
money
than
on
the
results
of
one
own
efforts
many
a
great
many
people
had
taken
advantage
of
the
discovery
and
as
no
patent
law
protected
it
it
was
not
surprising
that
levi
should
be
anxious
to
profit
by
it
too
more
particularly
as
he
had
no
money
himself
and
no
inclination
to
work
for
a
family
which
was
not
his
own
he
therefore
put
on
his
best
suit
one
day
and
called
on
his
uncle
smith
oh
indeed
you
have
an
idea
said
smith
let
hear
it
it
a
good
thing
to
have
ideas
i
have
been
thinking
of
floating
a
joint
stock
company
very
good
aaron
will
be
treasurer
simon
secretary
isaac
cashier
and
the
other
boys
it
a
good
idea
go
on
what
sort
of
a
company
is
it
going
to
be
i
thinking
of
a
marine
insurance
society
indeed
so
far
so
good
everybody
has
to
insure
his
property
when
he
goes
on
a
voyage
but
your
idea
this
my
idea
i
do
think
much
of
it
we
have
the
big
society
it
a
good
society
yours
would
have
to
be
better
if
you
intend
to
compete
with
it
what
would
be
the
novelty
in
your
society
oh
i
understand
i
should
reduce
the
premiums
and
all
the
patrons
of
the
would
come
to
me
that
better
very
well
then
the
prospectus
which
i
would
print
would
begin
in
this
way
the
crying
need
of
reducing
the
marine
insurance
premiums
has
long
been
felt
and
it
is
only
owing
to
the
want
of
competition
that
it
has
not
yet
been
done
we
the
undersigned
beg
to
invite
the
public
to
take
up
shares
in
the
new
society
what
name
triton
triton
what
sort
of
a
chap
was
he
he
was
a
all
right
triton
it
will
make
a
good
poster
you
can
order
it
from
ranch
in
berlin
and
we
will
reproduce
it
in
my
almanac
country
now
for
the
undersigned
first
of
course
my
name
we
must
have
big
names
give
me
the
official
almanac
smith
turned
over
the
leaves
for
some
time
a
marine
insurance
company
must
have
a
naval
officer
of
high
rank
let
me
see
an
admiral
oh
those
sort
of
people
have
no
money
bless
me
you
do
know
much
about
business
my
boy
they
are
only
wanted
to
subscribe
not
to
pay
up
and
they
receive
their
dividends
for
attending
the
meetings
and
being
present
at
the
directors
dinners
here
we
have
two
admirals
one
of
them
has
the
commander
ribbon
of
the
polar
star
and
the
other
one
has
the
russian
order
of
anna
what
shall
we
do
i
think
we
had
better
take
the
russian
for
there
is
splendid
marine
insurance
ground
in
russia
there
but
is
it
such
a
simple
matter
to
get
hold
of
these
people
tut
tut
next
we
want
a
retired
minister
of
state
yes
well
they
are
called
your
excellency
yes
good
and
a
count
that
more
difficult
counts
have
lots
of
money
and
we
must
have
a
professor
they
have
no
money
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
professor
of
navigation
that
would
be
a
capital
thing
for
our
venture
is
there
a
school
of
navigation
somewhere
near
the
south
theatre
yes
very
well
everything
is
as
clear
as
possible
to
me
oh
i
nearly
forgot
the
most
important
point
we
must
have
a
legal
man
a
counsellor
of
a
high
court
here
he
is
but
we
have
no
money
yet
money
what
the
use
of
money
in
company
promoting
does
the
man
who
insures
his
goods
pay
us
money
what
or
do
we
pay
him
no
well
then
he
pays
with
his
premiums
but
the
original
capital
one
issues
debentures
true
but
there
must
be
some
cash
one
pays
cash
in
debentures
is
that
paying
supposing
i
gave
you
a
cheque
for
a
sum
any
bank
would
cash
it
for
you
therefore
a
cheque
is
money
very
well
and
is
there
a
law
which
ordains
that
cash
shall
mean
if
there
were
what
about
private
how
large
should
the
capital
be
very
small
it
bad
business
to
tie
up
large
sums
a
million
three
hundred
thousand
in
cash
and
the
remainder
in
debentures
but
but
but
the
three
hundred
thousand
crowns
surely
must
be
in
good
lord
in
heaven
notes
are
money
if
you
have
notes
well
and
good
if
you
have
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
therefore
we
must
interest
the
small
capitalists
who
have
nothing
but
and
the
big
ones
how
do
they
pay
in
shares
debenture
guarantees
of
course
but
that
will
be
a
matter
for
later
on
get
them
to
subscribe
and
we
see
to
the
rest
and
only
three
hundred
thousand
one
single
great
steamer
costs
as
much
supposing
we
insured
a
thousand
steamers
a
thousand
last
year
the
issued
thousand
insurance
policies
and
did
well
out
of
it
all
the
worse
i
say
but
if
but
if
matters
should
go
wrong
one
goes
into
liquidation
liquidation
declares
oneself
insolvent
that
the
proper
term
and
what
does
it
matter
if
the
society
becomes
insolvent
it
is
you
or
i
or
he
but
one
can
also
increase
the
number
of
shares
or
issue
debentures
which
the
government
may
buy
up
in
hard
times
at
a
good
price
there
no
risk
then
not
the
slightest
besides
what
have
you
got
to
lose
do
you
possess
one
farthing
no
very
well
then
what
do
i
risk
five
hundred
crowns
i
shall
only
take
five
shares
you
see
and
five
hundred
is
as
much
as
this
to
me
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
the
matter
was
settled
the
society
was
floated
and
during
the
first
ten
years
of
its
activity
it
paid
and
per
cent
the
shares
were
eagerly
bought
up
and
in
order
to
enlarge
the
business
more
shares
were
issued
the
new
issue
of
shares
was
followed
by
a
general
meeting
of
shareholders
falk
was
sent
to
report
it
for
the
whose
assistant
reporter
he
was
when
on
a
sunny
afternoon
in
june
he
entered
the
exchange
the
hall
was
already
crowded
with
people
it
was
a
brilliant
assembly
statesmen
geniuses
men
of
letters
officers
and
civil
service
men
of
high
rank
uniforms
orders
and
ribbons
all
those
here
assembled
had
one
big
general
interest
the
advancement
of
the
philanthropic
institution
called
marine
insurance
it
required
a
great
love
to
risk
one
money
for
the
benefit
of
the
suffering
neighbour
whom
misfortune
had
befallen
but
here
was
love
falk
had
never
seen
such
an
accumulation
of
it
in
one
spot
although
not
yet
an
entirely
disillusioned
man
he
could
not
suppress
a
feeling
of
amazement
but
he
was
even
more
amazed
when
he
noticed
the
little
blackguard
struve
the
former
socialist
creeping
through
the
crowd
like
a
reptile
greeted
and
sometimes
addressed
by
distinguished
people
with
a
familiar
nod
a
pressure
of
the
hand
or
a
friendly
slap
on
the
shoulder
he
saw
a
man
wearing
a
ribbon
belonging
to
a
high
order
nodding
to
him
and
he
noticed
that
struve
blushed
and
concealed
himself
behind
an
embroidered
coat
this
brought
him
into
falk
vicinity
and
the
latter
immediately
accosted
him
and
asked
him
who
the
man
was
struve
embarrassment
increased
but
summoning
up
all
his
impudence
he
replied
you
ought
to
know
that
he
the
president
of
the
board
of
payment
of
employés
salaries
no
sooner
had
the
words
left
his
lips
than
he
pretended
to
be
called
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
but
he
was
in
so
great
a
hurry
that
falk
wondered
whether
he
felt
uncomfortable
in
his
society
a
blackguard
in
the
company
of
an
honourable
man
the
brilliant
assembly
began
to
be
seated
but
the
president
chair
was
still
vacant
falk
was
looking
for
the
reporter
table
and
when
he
discovered
struve
and
the
reporter
for
the
sitting
at
a
table
on
the
side
of
the
secretary
he
took
his
courage
into
his
hands
and
marched
through
the
distinguished
crowd
just
as
he
had
reached
the
table
the
secretary
stopped
him
with
a
question
for
which
paper
he
asked
a
momentary
silence
ensued
for
the
answered
falk
with
a
slight
tremor
in
his
voice
he
had
recognized
in
the
secretary
the
actuary
of
the
board
of
payment
of
employés
salaries
a
murmur
ran
through
the
room
presently
the
secretary
said
in
a
loud
voice
your
place
is
at
the
back
over
there
he
pointed
to
the
door
and
a
small
table
standing
close
to
it
falk
realized
in
a
moment
the
significance
of
the
word
conservative
and
also
what
it
meant
to
be
a
journalist
who
was
not
a
conservative
boiling
inwardly
he
retraced
his
footsteps
walking
to
his
appointed
place
through
the
sneering
crowd
he
stared
at
the
grinning
faces
challenging
them
with
burning
eyes
when
his
glance
met
another
glance
quite
in
the
background
close
to
the
wall
the
eyes
bearing
a
strong
resemblance
to
a
pair
of
eyes
now
closed
in
death
which
used
to
rest
on
his
face
full
of
love
were
green
with
malice
and
pierced
him
like
a
needle
he
could
have
shed
tears
of
sorrow
at
the
thought
that
a
brother
could
thus
look
at
a
brother
he
took
his
modest
place
near
the
door
for
he
was
determined
not
to
beat
a
retreat
very
soon
he
was
roused
from
his
apparent
calm
by
a
newcomer
who
prodded
him
in
the
back
as
he
took
off
his
coat
and
shoved
a
pair
of
rubber
overshoes
underneath
his
chair
the
newcomer
was
greeted
by
the
whole
assembly
which
rose
from
their
seats
as
one
man
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
marine
insurance
society
limited
triton
but
he
was
something
else
beside
this
he
was
a
retired
a
baron
one
of
the
eighteen
of
the
swedish
academy
an
excellency
a
knight
of
many
orders
etc
etc
a
rap
with
the
hammer
and
amid
dead
silence
the
president
whispered
the
following
oration
just
delivered
by
him
at
a
meeting
of
the
coal
company
limited
in
the
hall
of
the
polytechnic
gentlemen
amongst
all
the
patriotic
and
philanthropic
enterprises
there
are
few
if
any
of
such
a
noble
and
beneficial
nature
as
an
insurance
society
this
statement
was
received
with
a
unanimous
hear
hear
which
however
made
no
impression
on
the
what
else
is
life
but
a
struggle
a
life
and
death
struggle
one
might
say
with
the
forces
of
nature
there
will
be
few
among
us
who
do
not
sooner
or
later
come
into
conflict
with
them
hear
hear
for
long
ages
man
more
especially
primitive
man
has
been
the
sport
of
the
elements
a
ball
tossed
hither
and
thither
a
glove
blown
here
and
there
by
the
wind
like
a
reed
this
is
no
longer
the
case
correct
in
saying
it
is
not
man
has
determined
to
rebel
it
is
a
bloodless
rebellion
though
and
very
different
to
the
revolutions
which
dishonourable
traitors
to
their
country
have
now
and
again
stirred
up
against
their
lawful
rulers
no
gentlemen
i
speaking
of
a
revolution
against
nature
man
has
declared
war
to
the
natural
forces
he
has
said
far
shalt
thou
go
and
no
farther
hear
hear
and
clapping
of
hands
the
merchant
sends
out
his
steamer
his
brig
his
schooner
his
barge
his
yacht
and
so
forth
the
gale
breaks
the
vessel
to
pieces
away
says
the
merchant
for
he
loses
nothing
this
is
the
great
aspect
of
the
insurance
idea
imagine
the
position
gentlemen
the
merchant
has
declared
war
upon
the
storms
of
heaven
and
the
merchant
has
won
the
day
a
storm
of
applause
brought
a
triumphant
smile
to
the
face
of
the
great
man
he
seemed
thoroughly
to
enjoy
this
storm
but
gentlemen
do
not
let
us
call
an
insurance
institution
a
business
it
is
not
a
business
we
are
not
business
men
far
from
it
we
have
collected
a
sum
of
money
and
we
are
ready
to
risk
it
is
this
not
so
gentlemen
yes
yes
we
have
collected
a
sum
of
money
so
as
to
have
it
ready
to
hand
over
to
him
whom
misfortune
has
befallen
his
percentage
i
think
he
pays
per
can
not
be
called
a
contribution
it
is
called
a
premium
and
rightly
so
not
that
we
want
any
sort
of
reward
premium
means
reward
for
our
little
services
which
we
merely
render
because
we
are
interested
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
is
purely
for
this
reason
i
repeat
i
do
think
there
can
be
any
question
that
any
one
in
our
midst
would
hesitate
i
do
think
that
one
of
us
would
mind
seeing
his
contribution
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
call
the
shares
by
that
name
used
for
the
furtherance
of
the
idea
no
no
i
will
now
ask
the
managing
director
to
read
the
annual
report
the
director
rose
he
looked
as
pale
as
if
he
had
been
through
a
storm
his
big
cuffs
with
the
onyx
studs
could
hardly
hide
the
slight
trembling
of
his
hand
his
cunning
eyes
sought
comfort
and
strength
in
smith
bearded
face
he
opened
his
coat
and
his
expansive
shirt
front
swelled
as
if
it
were
ready
to
receive
a
shower
of
arrows
and
read
truly
strange
and
unexpected
are
the
ways
of
providence
at
the
word
providence
a
considerable
number
of
faces
blanched
but
the
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
ceiling
as
if
he
were
prepared
for
the
worst
a
loss
of
two
hundred
crowns
the
year
which
we
have
just
completed
will
long
stand
in
our
annals
like
a
cross
on
the
grave
of
the
accidents
which
have
brought
to
scorn
the
foresight
of
the
wisest
and
the
calculations
of
the
most
cautious
the
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
as
if
he
were
praying
struve
believing
that
the
white
wall
dazzled
his
eyes
jumped
up
to
pull
down
the
blind
but
the
secretary
had
already
forestalled
him
the
reader
drank
a
glass
of
water
this
caused
an
outburst
of
impatience
to
business
figures
the
removed
his
hand
from
his
eyes
and
was
taken
aback
when
he
found
that
it
was
so
much
darker
than
it
had
been
before
there
was
a
momentary
embarrassment
and
the
storm
gathered
all
respect
was
forgotten
to
business
go
on
the
director
skipped
the
preliminary
banalities
and
plunged
right
into
the
heart
of
the
matter
very
well
gentlemen
i
will
cut
my
speech
short
go
on
go
on
why
the
devil
do
you
the
hammer
fell
gentlemen
there
was
so
much
dignity
in
this
brief
gentlemen
that
the
assembly
immediately
remembered
their
the
society
has
been
responsible
during
the
year
for
one
hundred
and
millions
hear
hear
and
has
received
a
million
and
a
half
in
premiums
hear
hear
falk
made
a
hasty
calculation
and
found
that
if
the
full
receipts
in
premiums
namely
one
million
and
a
half
and
the
total
original
capital
one
million
were
deducted
there
remained
about
one
hundred
and
millions
for
which
the
society
was
responsible
he
realized
what
the
ways
of
providence
meant
unfortunately
the
amount
paid
on
policies
was
one
million
seven
hundred
and
thousand
six
hundred
and
seventy
crowns
and
eight
öre
shame
as
you
see
gentlemen
providence
leave
providence
alone
figures
figures
dividends
under
the
circumstances
i
can
only
propose
in
my
capacity
as
managing
director
a
dividend
of
per
cent
on
the
capital
now
a
storm
burst
out
which
no
merchant
in
the
world
could
have
weathered
shame
impudence
swindler
five
per
cent
disgusting
it
throwing
one
money
away
but
there
were
also
a
few
more
philanthropic
utterances
such
as
what
about
the
poor
small
capitalists
who
have
nothing
but
their
dividends
to
live
on
how
they
manage
mercy
on
us
what
a
misfortune
the
state
ought
to
help
and
without
delay
oh
dear
oh
dear
when
the
storm
had
subsided
a
little
and
the
director
could
make
his
voice
heard
he
read
out
the
high
praise
given
by
the
supervisory
committee
to
the
managing
director
and
all
the
employés
who
without
sparing
themselves
and
with
indefatigable
zeal
had
done
the
thankless
work
the
statement
was
received
with
open
scorn
the
report
of
the
accountants
was
then
read
they
stated
after
again
censuring
providence
that
they
had
found
all
the
books
in
good
not
to
say
excellent
order
and
in
checking
the
inventory
all
debentures
on
the
reserve
fund
had
been
found
correct
they
therefore
called
upon
the
shareholders
to
discharge
the
directors
and
acknowledge
their
honest
and
unremitting
labour
the
directors
were
of
course
discharged
the
managing
director
then
declared
that
under
the
circumstances
he
could
not
think
of
accepting
his
bonus
a
hundred
crowns
and
handed
it
to
the
reserve
fund
this
declaration
was
received
with
applause
and
laughter
after
a
short
evening
prayer
that
is
to
say
a
humble
petition
to
providence
that
next
year
dividend
might
be
per
the
closed
the
proceedings
chapter
xiii
divine
ordinance
on
the
same
afternoon
on
which
her
husband
had
attended
the
meeting
of
the
marine
insurance
society
triton
falk
for
the
first
time
wore
a
new
blue
velvet
dress
with
which
she
was
eager
to
arouse
the
envy
of
homan
who
lived
in
the
house
opposite
nothing
was
easier
or
more
simple
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
show
herself
every
now
and
then
at
the
window
while
she
supervised
the
preparations
in
her
room
intended
to
crush
her
guests
whom
she
expected
at
seven
the
administrative
committee
of
the
crèche
bethlehem
was
to
meet
and
examine
the
first
monthly
report
it
consisted
of
homan
whose
husband
the
controller
falk
suspected
of
pride
because
he
was
a
government
official
lady
rehnhjelm
whom
she
suspected
of
the
same
failing
because
of
her
title
and
the
rev
skore
who
was
private
chaplain
of
all
the
great
families
the
whole
committee
was
to
be
crushed
and
crushed
in
the
sweetest
possible
manner
the
new
setting
for
the
scene
had
already
been
displayed
at
the
big
party
all
the
old
pieces
which
were
neither
antique
nor
possessed
of
any
artistic
value
had
been
replaced
by
brand
new
furniture
falk
intended
to
manage
the
actors
in
the
little
play
until
the
close
of
the
proceedings
when
her
husband
would
arrive
upon
the
scene
with
an
admiral
he
had
promised
his
wife
at
least
an
admiral
in
uniform
both
were
to
crave
admission
to
the
society
falk
was
to
enlarge
the
funds
of
the
society
on
the
spot
by
handing
over
to
it
a
part
of
the
sum
which
he
had
been
earning
so
easily
as
shareholder
of
the
triton
falk
had
finished
with
the
window
and
was
now
arranging
the
rosewood
table
inlaid
with
on
which
the
proofs
of
the
monthly
report
were
to
be
laid
she
dusted
the
agate
inkstand
placed
the
silver
penholder
on
the
tortoiseshell
rack
turned
up
the
seal
of
the
chrysoprase
handle
so
as
to
hide
her
commoner
name
cautiously
shook
the
made
of
the
finest
steel
wire
so
that
the
value
of
the
few
it
contained
could
be
plainly
read
finally
having
given
her
last
orders
to
the
footman
dressed
up
for
the
parade
she
sat
down
in
her
in
the
careless
attitude
in
which
she
desired
that
the
announcement
of
her
friend
the
controller
wife
should
discover
her
homan
would
be
sure
to
be
the
first
to
arrive
she
did
arrive
first
falk
embraced
evelyn
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
homan
embraced
eugenia
who
received
her
in
the
and
retained
her
there
for
a
few
moments
in
order
to
ask
her
opinion
of
the
new
furniture
homan
wasted
no
time
on
the
solid
oak
sideboard
dating
from
the
time
of
charles
xii
with
the
tall
japanese
vases
because
she
felt
small
by
the
side
of
it
she
looked
at
the
chandelier
which
she
found
too
modern
and
the
which
she
said
was
not
in
keeping
with
the
prevailing
style
in
addition
to
this
she
considered
that
the
oleographs
were
out
of
place
among
the
old
family
portraits
and
took
quite
a
long
time
to
explain
the
difference
between
an
oil
painting
and
an
oleograph
falk
new
velvet
dress
swished
against
every
corner
within
reach
without
succeeding
in
attracting
her
friend
attention
she
asked
her
whether
she
liked
the
new
brussels
carpet
in
the
homan
thought
it
contrasted
too
crudely
with
the
curtains
at
last
falk
felt
annoyed
with
her
and
dropped
her
questions
they
sat
down
at
the
table
clutching
at
in
the
guise
of
photographs
unreadable
volumes
of
verse
and
so
on
a
little
pamphlet
fell
into
homan
hands
it
was
printed
on
pink
paper
and
bore
the
title
to
the
wholesale
merchant
nicholas
falk
on
his
fortieth
birthday
ah
these
are
the
verses
which
were
read
at
your
party
who
wrote
them
a
very
clever
man
a
friend
of
my
husband
his
name
nyström
hm
how
queer
that
his
name
should
be
quite
unknown
such
a
clever
man
but
why
was
he
at
your
party
unfortunately
he
was
ill
my
dear
so
he
could
come
i
see
but
my
dear
eugenia
is
it
awfully
sad
about
your
i
hear
he
so
very
badly
off
do
mention
him
he
a
disgrace
and
a
grief
to
the
whole
family
it
terrible
yes
it
was
quite
unpleasant
when
everybody
asked
about
him
at
your
party
i
was
so
sorry
for
you
dear
this
is
for
the
oak
sideboard
dating
from
the
time
of
charles
xii
and
the
japanese
vases
thought
the
controller
wife
for
me
oh
please
do
you
mean
for
my
husband
interrupted
falk
surely
that
the
same
thing
not
at
all
i
ca
be
held
responsible
for
all
the
black
sheep
in
his
family
what
a
pity
it
was
that
your
parents
also
were
ill
and
come
how
your
dear
father
thanks
he
quite
well
again
how
kind
of
you
to
think
of
everybody
well
one
should
think
of
oneself
only
is
he
delicate
the
old
what
his
title
captain
if
you
like
captain
i
was
under
the
impression
that
my
husband
said
he
was
one
of
the
crew
of
the
flagship
but
very
likely
it
the
same
thing
but
where
were
the
girls
that
for
the
brussels
carpet
mentally
reflected
the
wife
they
are
so
full
of
whims
they
can
never
be
depended
on
falk
turned
over
the
leaves
in
her
photograph
album
the
binding
cracked
she
was
in
a
towering
rage
i
say
dear
who
was
the
disagreeable
individual
who
read
the
verses
on
the
night
of
your
party
you
mean
levin
the
royal
secretary
he
my
husband
most
intimate
friend
is
he
really
hm
how
strange
my
husband
a
controller
in
the
same
office
where
he
a
secretary
i
do
want
to
vex
you
or
say
anything
unpleasant
i
never
do
but
my
husband
says
that
levin
in
such
bad
circumstances
that
it
not
wise
for
your
husband
to
associate
with
him
does
he
that
a
matter
of
which
i
know
nothing
and
in
which
i
interfere
and
let
me
tell
you
my
dear
evelyn
i
never
interfere
in
my
husband
affairs
though
i
heard
of
people
who
do
i
beg
your
pardon
dear
i
thought
i
was
doing
you
a
service
by
telling
you
that
for
the
chandelier
and
the
there
only
remains
the
velvet
dress
well
the
controller
wife
took
up
the
thread
again
i
hear
that
your
spare
my
feelings
and
do
talk
of
the
creature
is
he
really
such
a
bad
lot
i
been
told
that
he
associates
with
the
worst
characters
in
town
at
this
juncture
falk
was
reprieved
the
footman
announced
lady
rehnhjelm
oh
how
welcome
she
was
how
kind
of
her
it
was
to
come
and
falk
really
was
pleased
to
see
the
old
lady
with
the
kindly
expression
in
her
eyes
an
expression
only
found
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
have
weathered
the
storms
of
life
with
true
courage
my
dear
falk
said
her
ladyship
taking
a
seat
i
have
all
sorts
of
kind
messages
for
you
from
your
falk
wondered
what
she
had
done
to
the
old
woman
that
she
too
evidently
wanted
to
annoy
her
indeed
she
said
a
little
stiffly
he
a
charming
young
man
he
came
to
see
my
nephew
at
my
house
they
are
great
friends
he
really
is
an
excellent
young
man
is
he
joined
in
homan
always
ready
for
a
change
of
front
we
were
just
talking
about
him
indeed
what
i
most
admire
in
him
is
his
courage
in
venturing
on
a
course
where
one
easily
runs
aground
but
we
need
have
no
apprehensions
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
he
a
man
of
character
and
principle
you
agree
with
me
mrs
falk
i
always
said
so
but
my
husband
thinks
differently
oh
your
husband
has
always
had
peculiar
views
interposed
homan
is
he
a
friend
of
your
nephew
lady
rehnhjelm
asked
falk
eagerly
yes
they
both
belong
to
a
small
circle
some
of
the
members
of
which
are
artists
you
must
have
heard
about
young
sellén
whose
picture
was
bought
by
his
majesty
of
course
i
have
we
went
to
the
exhibition
on
purpose
to
have
a
look
at
it
is
he
one
of
them
yes
they
often
very
hard
up
these
young
fellows
but
nothing
new
in
the
case
of
young
men
who
have
to
fight
their
way
in
the
world
they
say
your
a
poet
went
on
homan
oh
rather
he
writes
excellent
verse
the
academy
gave
him
a
prize
the
world
will
hear
of
him
in
time
replied
falk
with
conviction
have
i
always
said
so
agreed
homan
and
arvid
falk
talents

enlarged
upon
so
that

had
arrived
in

temple
of
fame

i
ask
the
meeting
whether
all
this
is

interrupted
her
ladyship
well
of
course
answered
the
pastor
then
i
must
resign
my
post
on
the
administrative
committee
but
do
you
imagine
lady
rehnhjelm
that
the
society
could
exist
on
voluntary
contributions
if
the
names
of
the
donors
did
not
appear
in
print
impossible
is
charity
to
shed
its
radiance
on
petty
vanity
no
no
do
say
that
vanity
is
an
evil
certainly
we
turn
the
evil
into
good
by
transforming
it
into
charity
is
that
praiseworthy
oh
yes
but
we
must
call
petty
things
by
names
if
we
do
we
are
boastful
you
are
very
severe
lady
rehnhjelm
scripture
exhorts
us
to
pardon
others
you
should
pardon
their
vanity
i
ready
to
pardon
it
in
others
but
not
in
myself
it
pardonable
and
good
that
ladies
who
have
nothing
else
to
do
should
find
pleasure
in
charity
but
it
disgraceful
if
they
call
it
a
good
action
seeing
that
it
is
only
their
pleasure
and
a
greater
pleasure
than
most
others
on
account
of
the
wide
publicity
given
to
it
by
printing
oh
began
falk
with
the
full
force
of
her
terrible
logic
do
you
mean
to
say
that
doing
good
is
disgraceful
lady
rehnhjelm
no
my
dear
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
disgraceful
to
print
the
fact
that
one
has
given
a
pair
of
woollen
stockings
but
to
give
a
pair
of
woollen
stockings
is
doing
good
therefore
it
must
be
disgraceful
to
do
good
no
but
to
have
it
printed
my
child
you
are
listening
to
what
saying
replied
her
ladyship
reproving
her
stubborn
hostess
who
would
not
give
in
but
went
on
i
see
it
the
printing
which
is
disgraceful
but
the
bible
is
printed
consequently
it
is
disgraceful
to
print
the
bible
please
go
on
pastor
interrupted
her
ladyship
a
little
annoyed
by
the
tactless
manner
in
which
her
hostess
defended
her
inanities
but
the
latter
did
not
yet
count
the
battle
as
lost
do
you
think
it
beneath
your
dignity
lady
rehnhjelm
to
exchange
views
with
so
unimportant
a
person
as
i
am
no
my
child
but
keep
your
views
to
yourself
i
do
want
to
exchange
do
you
call
this
discussing
a
question
may
i
ask
wo
you
enlighten
us
on
the
point
pastor
can
it
be
called
discussing
a
question
if
one
party
refuses
to
reply
to
the
argument
of
the
other
of
course
it
ca
my
dear
falk
replied
the
pastor
with
an
ambiguous
smile
which
nearly
reduced
falk
to
tears
but
let
us
spoil
a
splendid
enterprise
by
quarrelling
over
trifles
ladies
we
postpone
the
printing
until
the
funds
are
larger
we
have
seen
the
young
enterprise
shooting
up
like
a
seed
and
we
have
seen
that
powerful
hands
are
willing
to
tend
the
young
plant
but
we
must
think
of
the
future
the
society
has
a
fund
the
fund
must
be
administered
in
other
words
we
must
look
round
for
an
administrator
a
practical
man
able
to
transform
these
presents
into
hard
cash
we
must
elect
a
treasurer
i
afraid
we
shall
not
find
one
without
a
sacrifice
of
money
does
one
ever
get
anything
without
such
a
sacrifice
have
the
ladies
anybody
in
view
no
the
ladies
had
not
thought
of
it
then
may
i
propose
a
young
man
of
steady
character
who
in
my
opinion
is
just
the
right
person
for
the
work
has
the
administrative
committee
any
objection
to
appointing
secretary
ekelund
to
the
post
of
treasurer
at
a
suitable
salary
the
ladies
had
no
objection
to
make
especially
as
the
young
man
was
recommended
by
the
rev
nathanael
skore
and
the
pastor
felt
the
more
qualified
to
recommend
him
because
he
was
a
near
relative
of
his
and
so
the
crèche
had
a
treasurer
with
a
salary
of
six
hundred
crowns
ladies
began
the
pastor
again
have
we
worked
long
enough
in
the
vineyard
for
one
day
there
was
silence
falk
stared
at
the
door
wondering
where
her
husband
was
my
time
short
and
i
prevented
from
staying
any
longer
has
anybody
any
further
suggestion
to
make
no
in
calling
down
the
blessing
of
the
lord
on
our
enterprise
which
has
begun
so
auspiciously
i
commend
all
of
us
to
his
loving
mercy
i
can
not
do
it
in
a
better
way
than
by
repeating
the
words
which
he
himself
has
taught
us
when
he
prayed
father
our
father
he
was
silent
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
and
the
committee
covered
their
faces
with
their
hands
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
looking
each
other
in
the
eyes
the
ensuing
pause
grew
long
unbearably
long
yet
no
one
dared
to
break
it
every
one
looked
through
the
fingers
hoping
that
someone
else
would
make
the
first
move
when
a
violent
pull
at
the
front
door
bell
brought
the
party
down
to
earth
the
pastor
took
his
hat
and
emptied
his
glass
there
was
something
about
him
of
a
man
who
is
trying
to
steal
away
falk
beamed
for
here
was
the
crushing
the
vengeance
the
rehabilitation
revenge
was
there
and
the
crushing
too
for
the
footman
handed
her
a
letter
from
her
husband
which
contained
the
guests
were
not
enlightened
as
to
its
contents
but
they
saw
enough
to
make
them
declare
at
once
that
they
had
pressing
engagements
lady
rehnhjelm
would
have
liked
to
stay
and
comfort
her
young
hostess
whose
appearance
betrayed
a
high
degree
of
consternation
and
unhappiness
the
latter
however
did
not
encourage
her
but
on
the
contrary
was
so
exceedingly
eager
to
help
her
visitors
with
their
hats
and
cloaks
that
it
looked
as
if
she
wanted
to
be
rid
of
them
as
quickly
as
possible
they
parted
in
great
embarrassment
the
footsteps
died
away
on
the
staircase
and
the
departing
guests
could
tell
from
the
nervous
haste
with
which
the
hostess
shut
the
door
behind
them
that
she
longed
for
solitude
in
order
to
be
able
to
give
vent
to
her
feelings
it
was
quite
true
left
by
herself
in
the
large
rooms
falk
burst
into
violent
sobs
but
her
tears
were
not
the
tears
which
fall
like
a
may
shower
on
a
wizened
old
heart
they
were
the
tears
of
wrath
and
rage
which
darken
the
mirror
of
the
soul
and
fall
like
an
acid
on
the
roses
of
health
and
youth
and
wither
them
chapter
xiv
absinth
a
hot
afternoon
sun
was
scorching
the
pavements
of
the
provincial
town
the
large
vaults
of
the
town
hall
were
still
deserted
fir
branches
were
scattered
all
over
the
floor
and
it
smelt
of
a
funeral
the
graduated
liqueur
bottles
stood
on
the
shelves
having
an
afternoon
nap
opposite
the
brandy
bottles
which
wore
the
collars
of
their
orders
round
their
necks
and
were
on
leave
until
the
evening
the
clock
which
could
never
take
a
nap
stood
against
the
wall
like
a
tall
peasant
whiling
away
the
time
by
contemplating
apparently
a
huge
playbill
impaled
on
a
clothes
peg
close
by
the
vault
was
very
long
and
narrow
both
of
the
long
walls
were
furnished
with
birchwood
tables
jutting
out
from
the
wall
giving
it
the
appearance
of
a
stable
in
which
the
tables
represented
the
horses
tied
with
their
heads
to
the
wall
and
turning
their
hind
quarters
towards
the
room
at
the
present
moment
all
of
them
were
asleep
one
of
them
lifted
its
hind
leg
a
little
off
the
ground
for
the
floor
was
very
uneven
one
could
see
that
they
were
fast
asleep
for
the
flies
were
calmly
walking
up
and
down
their
backs
the
waiter
who
was
leaning
against
the
tall
clock
close
to
the
poster
was
not
asleep
he
was
incessantly
waving
his
white
apron
at
the
flies
which
had
just
finished
their
dinner
in
the
kitchen
and
were
now
playing
about
the
vaults
every
now
and
then
he
leaned
back
and
put
his
ear
to
the
chest
of
the
clock
as
if
he
were
sounding
it
or
wanting
to
find
out
what
it
had
had
for
dinner
he
was
soon
to
be
enlightened
the
tall
creature
gave
a
sob
and
exactly
four
minutes
later
it
sobbed
again
a
groaning
and
rumbling
in
its
inside
made
the
lad
jump
rattling
terribly
it
struck
six
times
after
which
it
continued
its
silent
work
the
boy
too
began
to
work
he
walked
round
his
stable
grooming
his
horses
with
his
apron
and
putting
everything
in
order
as
if
he
were
expecting
visitors
on
one
of
the
tables
in
the
background
from
which
a
spectator
could
view
the
whole
long
room
he
placed
matches
a
bottle
of
absinth
and
two
glasses
a
liqueur
glass
and
a
tumbler
then
he
fetched
a
bottle
of
water
from
the
pump
and
put
it
on
the
table
by
the
side
of
the
inflammables
when
everything
was
ready
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
occasionally
striking
quite
unexpected
attitudes
as
if
he
were
imitating
somebody
now
he
stood
with
arms
folded
across
his
chest
his
head
bowed
staring
fiercely
at
the
faded
paper
on
the
old
walls
now
he
stood
with
legs
crossed
the
knuckles
of
his
right
hand
touching
the
edge
of
the
table
holding
in
his
left
a
lorgnette
made
of
a
piece
of
wire
from
a
beer
bottle
through
which
he
sarcastically
scanned
the
mouldings
on
the
ceiling
the
door
flew
open
and
a
man
of
entered
with
assurance
as
if
he
were
coming
into
his
own
house
his
beardless
face
had
the
sharply
cut
features
which
are
the
result
of
much
exercise
of
the
facial
muscles
characteristic
of
actors
and
one
other
class
every
muscle
and
ligament
was
plainly
visible
under
the
skin
with
its
bluish
shadows
on
upper
lip
and
chin
but
the
miserable
which
set
these
fine
tangents
in
motion
was
invisible
for
he
was
not
like
a
common
piano
which
requires
a
pedal
a
high
rather
narrow
forehead
with
hollow
temples
rose
like
a
true
corinthian
capital
black
untidy
locks
of
hair
climbed
round
it
like
wild
creepers
from
which
small
straight
snakes
darted
trying
to
reach
the
sockets
of
his
eyes
but
ever
failing
to
do
so
in
calm
moments
his
large
dark
eyes
looked
gentle
and
sad
but
there
were
times
when
they
blazed
and
then
the
pupils
looked
like
the
muzzles
of
a
revolver
he
took
his
seat
at
the
table
which
the
boy
had
prepared
and
looked
sadly
at
the
water
bottle
why
do
you
always
give
me
a
bottle
of
water
gustav
so
that
you
wo
be
burned
to
death
sir
what
does
it
matter
to
you
whether
i
am
or
not
ca
i
burn
if
i
like
do
be
a
nihilist
sir
nihilist
who
talked
to
you
of
nihilists
when
did
you
hear
that
word
are
you
mad
boy
speak
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
fired
a
few
shots
from
his
dark
revolvers
fear
and
consternation
at
the
expression
in
the
actor
face
kept
gustav
tongue
tied
answer
boy
when
did
you
hear
this
word
montanus
said
it
a
few
days
ago
when
he
came
here
from
his
church
answered
the
boy
timidly
montanus
indeed
said
the
melancholy
man
sitting
down
again
montanus
is
my
man
he
has
a
large
understanding
i
say
gustav
what
the
name
i
mean
the
nickname
by
which
these
theatrical
blackguards
call
me
tell
me
you
need
be
afraid
i
rather
not
sir
it
very
ugly
why
not
if
you
can
please
me
by
doing
so
do
you
think
i
could
do
with
a
little
cheering
up
do
i
look
so
frightfully
gay
out
with
it
what
do
they
say
when
they
ask
you
whether
i
have
been
here
do
they
say
has
the
devil
ah
the
devil
they
hate
me
do
they
yes
they
do
good
but
why
have
i
done
them
any
harm
no
they
ca
say
that
sir
no
i
do
think
they
can
but
they
say
that
you
ruin
people
sir
ruin
yes
they
say
that
you
ruined
me
sir
because
i
find
that
nothing
new
in
the
world
hm
hm
i
suppose
you
tell
them
that
their
jokes
are
stale
yes
everything
they
say
is
stale
they
are
so
stale
themselves
that
they
make
me
sick
indeed
and
do
you
think
that
being
a
waiter
is
stale
yes
i
do
life
and
death
and
everything
is
an
old
story
no
to
be
an
actor
would
be
something
new
no
my
friend
that
is
the
stalest
of
all
stale
stories
but
shut
up
now
i
want
to
forget
myself
he
drank
his
absinth
and
rested
his
head
against
the
wall
with
its
long
brown
streak
the
track
on
which
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
had
ascended
during
the
six
long
years
he
had
been
sitting
there
smoking
the
rays
of
the
sun
fell
through
the
window
passing
through
the
sieve
of
the
great
aspens
outside
whose
light
foliage
dancing
in
the
evening
breeze
threw
a
tremulous
net
on
the
long
wall
the
shadow
of
the
melancholy
man
head
with
its
untidy
locks
of
hair
fell
on
the
lowest
corner
of
the
net
and
looked
very
much
like
a
huge
spider
gustav
had
returned
to
the
clock
where
he
sat
plunged
in
nihilistic
silence
watching
the
flies
dancing
round
the
hanging
lamp
gustav
came
a
voice
from
the
spider
web
yes
sir
was
the
prompt
response
from
the
clock
are
your
parents
still
alive
no
sir
you
know
they
are
good
for
you
a
long
pause
gustav
yes
sir
can
you
sleep
at
night
what
do
you
mean
sir
answered
gustav
blushing
what
i
say
of
course
i
can
why
should
i
why
do
you
want
to
be
an
actor
i
do
know
i
believe
i
should
be
happy
are
you
happy
now
i
do
know
i
do
think
so
has
rehnhjelm
been
here
again
no
sir
but
he
said
he
would
come
here
to
meet
you
about
this
time
a
long
pause
the
door
opened
and
a
shadow
fell
into
the
spider
net
it
trembled
and
the
spider
in
the
corner
made
a
quick
movement
mr
rehnhjelm
said
the
melancholy
head
mr
falander
glad
to
meet
you
you
came
here
before
yes
i
arrived
this
afternoon
and
called
at
once
you
guess
my
purpose
i
want
to
go
on
the
stage
do
you
really
you
amaze
me
amaze
you
yes
but
why
do
you
come
to
me
first
because
i
know
that
you
are
one
of
our
finest
actors
and
because
a
mutual
friend
montanus
the
sculptor
told
me
that
you
were
in
every
way
to
be
trusted
did
he
well
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
want
advice
wo
you
sit
down
if
i
may
act
as
host
i
could
think
of
such
a
thing
then
as
my
own
guest
if
you
do
mind
as
you
like
you
want
advice
hm
shall
i
give
you
my
candid
opinion
yes
of
course
then
listen
to
me
take
what
i
going
to
say
seriously
and
never
forget
that
i
said
such
and
such
a
thing
on
such
and
such
an
evening
i
be
responsible
for
my
words
give
me
your
candid
opinion
i
prepared
for
anything
have
you
ordered
your
horses
no
then
do
so
and
go
home
do
you
think
me
incapable
of
becoming
an
actor
by
no
means
i
do
think
anybody
in
all
the
world
incapable
of
that
on
the
contrary
everybody
has
more
or
less
talent
for
acting
very
well
then
oh
the
reality
is
so
different
from
your
dream
you
young
your
blood
flows
quickly
through
your
veins
a
thousand
pictures
bright
and
beautiful
like
the
pictures
in
a
fairy
tale
throng
your
brain
you
want
to
bring
them
to
the
light
show
them
to
the
world
and
in
doing
so
experience
a
great
joy
is
that
so
yes
yes
you
expressing
my
very
thoughts
i
only
supposed
quite
a
common
case
i
do
suspect
bad
motives
behind
everything
although
i
have
a
bad
opinion
of
most
things
well
then
this
desire
of
yours
is
so
strong
that
you
would
rather
suffer
want
humiliate
yourself
allow
yourself
to
be
sucked
dry
by
vampires
lose
your
social
reputation
become
bankrupt
go
to
the
dogs
than
turn
back
am
i
right
yes
how
well
you
know
me
i
once
knew
a
young
man
i
know
him
no
longer
he
is
so
changed
he
was
fifteen
years
old
when
he
left
the
penitentiary
which
every
community
keeps
for
the
children
who
commit
the
outrageous
crime
of
being
born
and
where
the
innocent
little
ones
are
made
to
atone
for
their
parents
fall
from
grace
for
what
should
otherwise
become
of
society
please
remind
me
to
keep
to
the
subject
on
leaving
it
he
went
for
five
years
to
upsala
and
read
a
terrible
number
of
books
his
brain
was
divided
into
six
in
which
six
kinds
of
information
dates
names
a
whole
warehouseful
of
opinions
conclusions
theories
ideas
and
nonsense
of
every
description
were
stored
like
a
general
cargo
this
might
have
been
allowed
to
pass
for
there
plenty
of
room
in
a
brain
but
he
was
also
supposed
to
accept
foreign
thoughts
rotten
old
thoughts
which
others
had
chewed
for
a
and
which
they
now
vomited
it
filled
him
with
nausea
and
he
was
twenty
years
old
he
went
on
the
stage
look
at
my
watch
look
at
the
it
makes
sixty
little
steps
before
a
minute
has
passed
sixty
times
sixty
before
it
is
an
hour
times
the
number
and
it
is
a
day
three
hundred
and
times
and
it
is
only
a
year
now
imagine
ten
years
did
you
ever
wait
for
a
friend
outside
his
house
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
passes
like
a
flash
the
second
quarter
oh
one
does
mind
waiting
for
a
person
fond
of
the
third
quarter
he
not
coming
the
fourth
hope
and
fear
the
fifth
one
goes
away
but
hurries
back
the
sixth
damn
it
all
wasted
my
time
for
nothing
the
seventh
having
waited
so
long
i
might
just
as
well
wait
a
little
longer
the
eighth
raging
and
cursing
the
ninth
one
goes
home
lies
down
on
one
sofa
and
feels
as
calm
as
if
one
were
walking
arm
in
arm
with
death
he
waited
for
ten
years
ten
years
is
my
hair
standing
on
end
when
i
say
ten
years
look
at
it
ten
years
had
passed
before
he
was
allowed
to
play
a
part
when
he
did
he
had
a
tremendous
success
at
once
but
his
ten
wasted
years
had
brought
him
to
the
verge
of
insanity
he
was
mad
that
it
happened
ten
years
before
and
he
was
amazed
to
find
that
happiness
when
at
last
he
held
it
within
his
grasp
did
make
him
happy
and
so
he
was
unhappy
but
do
you
think
he
required
the
ten
years
for
the
study
of
his
art
how
could
he
study
it
when
he
was
never
allowed
to
play
he
was
a
the
scum
of
the
playbill
the
management
said
he
was
no
good
and
whenever
he
tried
to
find
an
engagement
at
another
theatre
he
was
told
that
he
had
no
repertoire
but
why
could
he
be
happy
when
his
luck
had
turned
do
you
think
an
immortal
soul
is
content
with
happiness
but
why
speak
about
it
your
resolution
is
irrevocable
my
advice
is
superfluous
there
is
but
one
teacher
experience
and
experience
is
as
capricious
or
as
calculating
as
a
schoolmaster
some
of
the
pupils
are
always
praised
others
are
always
beaten
you
are
born
to
be
praised
think
i
saying
this
because
you
belong
to
a
good
family
sufficiently
enlightened
not
to
make
that
fact
responsible
for
good
or
evil
in
this
case
it
is
a
particularly
negligible
quantity
for
on
the
stage
a
man
stands
or
falls
by
his
own
merit
i
hope
you
have
an
early
success
so
that
you
wo
be
enlightened
too
soon
i
believe
you
deserve
it
but
have
you
no
respect
for
your
art
the
greatest
and
most
sublime
of
all
arts
it
overrated
like
everything
about
which
men
write
books
it
full
of
danger
and
can
do
much
harm
a
beautifully
told
lie
can
impress
like
a
truth
it
like
a
mass
meeting
where
the
uncultured
majority
turns
the
scale
the
more
superficial
the
better
the
worse
the
better
i
do
mean
to
say
that
it
is
superfluous
that
ca
be
your
opinion
that
my
opinion
but
all
the
same
i
may
be
mistaken
but
have
you
really
no
respect
for
your
art
for
mine
why
should
i
have
more
respect
for
my
art
than
for
anybody
else
and
yet
you
played
the
greatest
parts
you
played
shakespeare
you
played
hamlet
have
you
never
been
touched
in
your
inmost
soul
when
speaking
that
tremendous
monologue
to
be
or
not
to
be
what
do
you
mean
by
tremendous
full
of
profound
thought
do
explain
yourself
is
it
so
full
of
profound
thought
to
say
shall
i
take
my
life
or
not
i
should
do
so
if
i
knew
what
comes
hereafter
and
everybody
else
would
do
the
same
thing
but
as
we
do
know
we
take
our
lives
is
that
so
very
profound
not
if
expressed
in
those
words
there
you
are
you
surely
contemplated
suicide
at
one
time
or
another
have
you
yes
i
suppose
most
people
have
and
why
did
you
do
it
because
like
hamlet
you
had
the
courage
not
knowing
what
comes
after
were
you
very
profound
then
of
course
i
was
therefore
it
nothing
but
a
banality
or
expressed
in
one
word
it
is
what
is
it
gustav
stale
came
a
voice
from
the
clock
a
voice
which
seemed
to
have
waited
for
its
cue
it
stale
but
supposing
the
poet
had
given
us
an
acceptable
supposition
of
a
future
life
that
would
have
been
something
new
is
everything
new
excellent
asked
rehnhjelm
under
the
pressure
of
all
the
new
ideas
to
which
he
had
been
listening
his
courage
was
fast
ebbing
away
new
ideas
have
one
great
merit
they
are
new
try
to
think
your
own
thoughts
and
you
will
always
find
them
new
will
you
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
knew
what
you
wanted
before
you
walked
in
at
that
door
and
that
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
next
seeing
that
we
are
discussing
shakespeare
you
are
a
strange
man
i
ca
help
confessing
that
you
right
in
what
you
saying
although
i
do
agree
with
you
what
do
you
say
to
anthony
speech
over
the
body
of
cæsar
is
it
remarkable
that
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
speak
about
you
seem
to
be
able
to
read
my
thoughts
exactly
what
i
was
telling
you
just
now
and
is
it
so
wonderful
considering
that
all
men
think
the
same
or
at
any
rate
say
the
same
thing
well
what
do
you
find
in
it
of
any
great
depth
i
ca
explain
in
words
do
you
think
it
a
very
commonplace
piece
of
sarcastic
oratory
one
expresses
exactly
the
reverse
of
one
meaning
and
if
the
points
are
sharpened
they
are
bound
to
sting
but
have
you
ever
come
across
anything
more
beautiful
than
the
dialogue
between
juliet
and
romeo
after
their
wedding
night
ah
you
mean
where
he
says
is
the
nightingale
and
not
the
lark
what
other
passage
could
i
mean
does
every
one
quote
that
it
is
a
wonderful
poetical
conception
on
which
the
effect
depends
do
you
think
shakespeare
greatness
depends
on
poetical
conceptions
why
do
you
break
up
everything
i
admire
why
do
you
take
away
my
supports
i
am
throwing
away
your
crutches
so
that
you
may
learn
to
walk
without
them
but
let
me
ask
you
to
keep
to
the
point
you
are
not
asking
you
are
compelling
me
to
do
so
then
you
should
steer
clear
of
me
your
parents
are
against
your
taking
this
step
yes
how
do
you
know
parents
always
are
why
overrate
my
judgment
you
should
never
exaggerate
anything
do
you
think
we
should
be
happier
if
we
did
happier
hm
do
you
know
anybody
who
is
happy
give
me
your
own
opinion
not
the
conventional
one
no
if
you
do
believe
anybody
is
happy
how
can
you
postulate
such
a
condition
as
being
happier
your
parents
are
alive
then
it
a
mistake
to
have
parents
why
what
do
you
mean
do
you
think
it
unfair
of
an
older
generation
to
bring
up
a
younger
one
in
its
antiquated
inanities
your
parents
expect
gratitude
from
you
i
suppose
and
does
one
owe
it
to
one
parents
for
what
for
the
fact
that
with
the
connivance
of
the
law
they
have
brought
us
into
this
world
of
misery
have
us
beaten
us
oppressed
us
humiliated
us
opposed
all
our
wishes
believe
me
a
revolution
is
needed
two
revolutions
why
do
you
take
some
absinth
are
you
afraid
of
it
look
at
the
bottle
it
marked
with
the
geneva
cross
it
heals
those
who
have
been
wounded
on
the
battlefield
friends
and
foes
alike
it
lulls
all
pain
blunts
the
keen
edge
of
thought
blots
out
memories
stifles
all
the
nobler
emotions
which
beguile
humanity
into
folly
and
finally
extinguishes
the
light
of
reason
do
you
know
what
the
light
of
reason
is
first
it
is
a
phrase
secondly
it
is
a
one
of
those
flames
you
know
which
play
about
spots
where
decaying
fish
have
engendered
phosphoretted
hydrogen
the
light
of
reason
is
phosphoretted
hydrogen
engendered
by
the
grey
brain
substance
it
is
a
strange
thing
everything
good
on
this
earth
perishes
and
is
forgotten
during
my
ten
years
touring
and
my
apparent
idleness
i
have
read
through
all
the
libraries
one
finds
in
small
towns
and
i
find
that
all
the
twaddle
and
nonsense
contained
in
the
books
is
popular
and
constantly
quoted
but
the
wisdom
is
neglected
and
pushed
aside
do
remind
me
to
keep
to
the
point
the
clock
went
through
its
diabolical
tricks
and
thundered
seven
the
door
was
flung
open
and
a
man
lurched
noisily
into
the
room
he
was
a
man
of
about
fifty
with
a
huge
heavy
head
fixed
between
a
pair
of
lumpy
shoulders
like
a
mortar
on
a
gun
carriage
with
a
permanent
elevation
of
degrees
looking
as
if
it
were
going
to
throw
bombs
at
the
stars
to
judge
from
the
face
the
owner
was
capable
of
all
possible
crimes
and
impossible
vices
but
too
great
a
coward
to
commit
any
he
immediately
threw
a
bombshell
at
the
melancholy
man
and
harshly
ordered
a
glass
of
grog
made
of
rum
in
grammatical
uncouth
language
and
in
the
voice
of
a
corporal
this
is
the
man
who
holds
your
fate
in
his
hands
whispered
the
melancholy
man
to
rehnhjelm
this
is
the
tragedian
and
my
deadly
foe
rehnhjelm
could
not
suppress
a
shudder
of
disgust
as
he
looked
at
the
terrible
individual
who
after
having
exchanged
a
look
of
hatred
with
falander
now
closed
the
passage
of
arms
by
repeated
expectorations
the
door
opened
again
and
in
glided
the
almost
elegant
figure
of
a
man
with
oily
hair
and
a
waxed
moustache
he
familiarly
took
his
place
by
the
side
of
the
who
gave
him
his
middle
finger
on
which
shone
a
ring
with
a
large
cornelian
this
is
the
editor
of
the
conservative
paper
the
defender
of
throne
and
altar
he
has
the
run
of
the
theatre
and
tries
to
seduce
all
the
girls
on
whom
the
has
cast
his
eye
he
started
his
career
as
a
government
official
but
had
to
resign
his
post
ashamed
to
tell
you
why
explained
falander
but
i
am
also
ashamed
to
remain
in
the
same
room
with
these
gentlemen
and
moreover
i
have
asked
a
few
friends
here
to
a
little
supper
in
celebration
of
my
recent
benefit
if
you
care
to
spend
the
evening
in
bad
company
among
the
most
unimportant
actors
two
notorious
ladies
and
an
old
blackguard
you
are
welcome
at
eight
rehnhjelm
hesitated
a
moment
before
he
accepted
the
invitation
the
spider
on
the
wall
climbed
through
his
net
as
if
to
examine
it
and
disappeared
the
fly
remained
in
its
place
a
little
longer
the
sun
sank
behind
the
cathedral
the
meshes
of
the
net
were
undone
as
if
they
had
never
existed
and
the
aspens
outside
the
window
shivered
the
great
man
and
raised
his
voice
and
shouted
he
had
forgotten
how
to
speak
did
you
see
the
attack
on
me
in
the
do
take
any
notice
of
such
piffle
take
no
notice
of
it
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
does
everybody
read
it
of
course
the
whole
town
does
i
should
like
to
give
him
a
the
impertinent
rascal
calls
me
affected
and
exaggerated
bribe
him
do
make
a
fuss
bribe
him
have
i
tried
it
but
these
liberal
journalists
are
damned
queer
if
you
are
on
friendly
terms
with
them
they
give
you
a
nice
enough
notice
but
they
wo
be
bribed
however
poor
they
may
be
oh
you
do
go
about
it
in
the
right
way
you
should
do
it
openly
you
could
send
them
presents
which
they
can
turn
into
cash
or
cash
if
you
like
but
anonymously
and
never
refer
to
it
as
i
do
in
your
case
no
old
chap
the
trick
does
work
in
their
case
i
tried
it
it
hell
to
reckon
with
people
with
opinions
who
do
you
think
was
the
victim
in
the
devil
clutches
to
change
the
subject
that
nothing
to
do
with
me
oh
but
i
think
it
has
gustav
who
was
the
gentleman
with
mr
falander
his
name
rehnhjelm
he
wants
to
go
on
the
stage
what
do
you
say
he
wants
to
go
on
the
stage
he
shouted
the
yes
that
it
replied
gustav
and
of
course
act
tragedy
parts
and
be
falander
protégé
and
not
come
to
me
and
take
away
my
parts
and
honour
us
by
playing
here
and
i
know
nothing
about
the
whole
matter
i
i
i
sorry
for
him
it
a
pity
bad
prospects
for
him
of
course
i
shall
patronize
him
take
him
under
my
wing
the
strength
of
my
wings
may
be
felt
even
when
i
do
fly
they
have
a
way
of
pinching
now
and
then
he
was
a
nice
looking
lad
a
smart
lad
beautiful
as
antinous
what
a
pity
he
come
to
me
first
i
should
have
given
him
falander
parts
every
one
of
them
oh
oh
oh
but
it
is
too
late
yet
hah
let
the
devil
corrupt
him
first
he
still
a
little
too
fresh
he
really
looked
quite
an
innocent
boy
poor
little
chap
i
only
say
help
him
the
sound
of
the
last
sentence
was
drowned
in
the
noise
made
by
the
grog
drinkers
of
the
whole
town
who
were
now
beginning
to
arrive
chapter
xv
the
theatrical
company
phoenix
on
the
following
day
rehnhjelm
awoke
late
in
the
morning
in
his
hotel
bed
memories
of
the
previous
night
arose
like
phantoms
and
crowded
round
him
he
saw
again
the
pretty
closely
shuttered
room
richly
decorated
with
flowers
in
which
the
orgy
had
been
held
he
saw
the
actress
a
lady
of
who
thanks
to
a
younger
rival
had
to
play
the
parts
of
old
women
he
saw
her
entering
the
room
in
a
frenzy
of
rage
and
despair
at
the
fresh
humiliations
heaped
upon
her
throwing
herself
full
length
on
the
sofa
drinking
glass
after
glass
of
wine
and
when
the
temperature
of
the
room
rose
opening
her
bodice
as
a
man
opens
his
waistcoat
after
a
dinner
he
saw
again
the
old
comedian
who
after
a
very
short
career
had
been
degraded
from
playing
lead
to
taking
servant
parts
he
now
entertained
the
tradespeople
of
the
town
with
his
songs
and
above
all
with
the
stories
of
his
short
glory
but
in
the
very
heart
of
the
clouds
of
smoke
and
his
drunken
visions
rehnhjelm
saw
the
picture
of
a
young
girl
of
sixteen
who
had
arrived
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
told
the
melancholy
falander
that
the
great
had
again
been
persecuting
her
with
insulting
proposals
vowing
that
in
future
unless
she
would
accede
to
them
she
should
play
only
the
very
smallest
parts
and
he
saw
falander
listening
to
everybody
troubles
and
complaints
breathing
on
them
until
they
vanished
he
watched
him
reducing
insults
humiliations
kicks
accidents
want
misery
and
grief
to
nothing
watched
him
teaching
his
friends
and
warning
them
never
to
exaggerate
anything
least
of
all
their
troubles
but
again
and
again
his
thoughts
reverted
to
the
little
girl
of
sixteen
with
the
innocent
face
with
whom
he
had
made
friends
and
who
had
kissed
him
when
they
parted
hungrily
passionately
to
be
quite
candid
her
kiss
had
taken
him
by
surprise
but
what
her
name
he
rose
and
stretching
out
his
hand
for
the
he
seized
a
tiny
handkerchief
spotted
with
wine
ah
here
was
her
name
ineffaceable
written
in
marking
ink
agnes
he
kissed
the
handkerchief
twice
on
the
cleanest
spot
and
put
it
into
his
box
when
he
had
carefully
dressed
himself
he
went
out
to
see
the
whom
he
confidently
expected
to
find
at
the
theatre
between
twelve
and
three
to
be
on
the
safe
side
he
arrived
at
the
office
at
twelve
he
found
no
one
there
but
a
porter
who
asked
him
what
he
wanted
and
put
himself
at
his
service
rehnhjelm
did
not
think
that
he
would
need
his
help
and
asked
to
see
the
he
was
told
that
the
was
at
the
present
moment
at
the
factory
but
would
no
doubt
come
to
the
office
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
rehnhjelm
supposed
factory
to
be
a
slang
expression
for
theatre
but
the
porter
explained
to
him
that
the
was
also
a
match
manufacturer
his
the
cashier
was
a
post
office
employé
and
never
came
to
the
theatre
before
two
his
son
the
secretary
had
a
post
in
the
telegraph
office
and
his
presence
could
never
be
safely
relied
upon
but
the
porter
who
seemed
to
guess
the
object
of
rehnhjelm
visit
handed
him
on
his
own
responsibility
and
in
the
name
of
the
theatre
a
copy
of
the
statutes
the
young
gentleman
was
at
liberty
to
amuse
himself
with
it
until
one
of
the
managerial
staff
arrived
rehnhjelm
possessed
his
soul
in
patience
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
to
study
the
documents
it
was
twelve
when
he
had
finished
reading
them
he
talked
to
the
porter
until
a
quarter
to
one
and
then
set
himself
to
fathom
the
meaning
of
paragraph
of
the
statutes
the
theatre
is
a
moral
institution
it
ran
therefore
the
members
of
the
company
should
endeavour
to
live
in
the
fear
of
god
and
to
lead
a
virtuous
and
moral
life
he
turned
and
twisted
the
sentence
about
trying
to
throw
light
upon
it
without
succeeding
if
the
theatre
is
a
moral
institution
he
mused
the
members
who
in
addition
to
the
manager
the
cashier
the
secretary
the
machinists
and
form
the
institution
need
not
endeavour
to
practise
all
these
beautiful
things
if
it
said
the
theatre
is
an
immoral
institution
and
therefore
there
would
be
some
sense
in
it
but
that
surely
the
management
does
not
intend
to
convey
he
thought
of
hamlet
words
words
but
immediately
remembered
that
to
quote
hamlet
was
stale
and
that
one
ought
to
clothe
one
thoughts
in
one
own
words
he
chose
his
own
term
and
called
the
regulations
nonsense
but
discarded
the
expression
again
because
it
was
not
original
but
then
the
original
was
not
original
either
paragraph
helped
him
to
while
away
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
meditation
on
the
text
the
theatre
is
not
a
place
for
amusement
it
does
not
merely
exist
to
give
pleasure
in
one
place
it
said
the
theatre
is
not
a
place
for
amusement
and
in
another
the
theatre
does
not
merely
exist
to
give
pleasure
therefore
it
did
exist
to
give
pleasure
to
a
certain
extent
he
reflected
under
what
circumstances
the
theatre
ministered
to
pleasure
it
was
amusing
to
see
children
especially
sons
defrauding
their
parents
more
particularly
when
the
parents
were
thrifty
goodhearted
and
sensible
it
was
amusing
to
see
wives
deceiving
their
husbands
especially
when
the
husband
was
old
and
required
his
care
besides
this
he
remembered
having
laughed
very
heartily
at
two
old
men
who
nearly
died
of
starvation
because
their
business
was
on
the
decline
and
that
to
this
day
all
the
world
laughed
at
it
in
a
piece
written
by
a
classical
author
he
also
recollected
having
been
much
amused
by
the
misfortune
of
an
elderly
man
who
had
become
deaf
and
that
together
with
six
hundred
other
men
and
women
he
had
shouted
with
laughter
at
a
priest
who
tried
by
natural
means
to
cure
his
insanity
the
result
of
his
mirth
had
been
particularly
stimulated
by
the
hypocrisy
displayed
by
the
wily
priest
in
order
to
gain
the
object
of
his
desire
why
does
one
laugh
he
wondered
and
as
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
he
tried
to
find
an
answer
one
laughed
at
misfortune
want
misery
vice
virtue
the
defeat
of
good
the
victory
of
evil
this
conclusion
which
was
partly
new
to
him
put
him
into
a
good
temper
he
found
a
great
deal
of
amusement
in
playing
with
his
thoughts
as
the
management
still
remained
invisible
he
went
on
playing
and
before
the
lapse
of
five
minutes
he
had
come
to
the
following
conclusion
in
a
tragedy
one
weeps
at
just
those
things
which
in
comedy
make
one
laugh
at
this
point
his
thoughts
were
arrested
the
great
burst
into
the
room
brushed
past
rehnhjelm
without
apparently
being
aware
of
his
presence
and
entered
a
room
on
the
left
whither
a
moment
afterwards
the
violent
ringing
of
a
bell
summoned
the
porter
in
less
than
half
a
minute
he
had
gone
in
and
come
out
again
announcing
that
his
highness
was
ready
to
receive
the
visitor
as
rehnhjelm
entered
the
director
had
already
fired
his
shot
and
his
mortar
was
fixed
at
an
angle
which
quite
prevented
him
from
perceiving
the
nervous
mortal
who
was
timidly
coming
into
the
room
but
he
had
no
doubt
heard
him
for
he
asked
him
immediately
in
an
offensive
manner
what
he
wanted
rehnhjelm
stammered
that
he
was
anxious
to
make
his
début
on
the
stage
what
a
début
have
you
a
repertory
sir
have
you
played
sheridan
been
called
ten
times
before
the
curtain
after
the
third
act
what
i
never
played
a
part
oh
i
see
that
quite
another
thing
he
sat
down
in
an
painted
with
silver
paint
and
covered
with
blue
brocade
his
face
had
become
a
mask
he
might
have
been
sitting
for
a
portrait
for
one
of
the
biographies
of
suetonius
shall
i
give
you
my
candid
opinion
what
leave
the
theatrical
profession
alone
impossible
i
repeat
leave
it
alone
it
the
worst
of
all
professions
full
of
humiliations
unpleasantnesses
little
annoyances
and
thorns
which
will
embitter
your
life
so
that
you
wish
you
had
never
been
born
he
looked
as
if
he
were
speaking
the
truth
but
rehnhjelm
resolution
was
not
to
be
shaken
i
beg
you
to
take
my
advice
i
solemnly
adjure
you
to
drop
this
idea
i
tell
you
that
the
prospects
are
so
bad
that
for
years
to
come
have
simply
to
walk
on
think
of
it
and
do
come
to
me
with
complaints
when
it
is
too
late
the
theatrical
career
is
so
infernally
difficult
sir
that
you
would
not
dream
of
taking
it
up
if
you
had
the
least
knowledge
of
it
it
a
hell
believe
me
i
have
spoken
it
was
a
waste
of
breath
well
would
you
prefer
an
engagement
without
a
début
the
risk
is
less
great
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
i
never
expected
more
then
you
better
sign
this
agreement
a
salary
of
twelve
hundred
crowns
and
a
two
years
engagement
do
you
agree
he
pulled
a
agreement
signed
by
the
management
from
underneath
the
and
gave
it
to
rehnhjelm
the
brain
was
whirling
at
the
thought
of
the
twelve
hundred
crowns
and
he
signed
it
without
a
look
at
the
contents
when
he
had
signed
the
held
out
his
large
middle
finger
with
the
cornelian
ring
and
said
be
welcome
he
flashed
at
him
with
the
gums
of
his
upper
jaw
and
the
yellow
and
bloodshot
whites
of
his
eyes
with
their
green
irises
the
audience
was
over
but
rehnhjelm
in
whose
opinion
the
whole
business
had
been
hurried
through
far
too
quickly
instead
of
moving
took
the
liberty
of
asking
whether
he
had
not
better
wait
until
all
the
members
of
the
management
were
assembled
the
management
shouted
the
great
tragedian
i
am
the
management
if
you
have
any
questions
to
ask
address
yourself
to
me
if
you
want
advice
come
to
me
to
me
sir
to
nobody
else
that
all
you
can
go
now
the
skirt
of
rehnhjelm
coat
must
have
caught
on
a
nail
for
he
turned
on
the
threshold
to
see
what
the
last
words
looked
like
but
he
saw
only
the
red
gums
which
had
the
appearance
of
an
instrument
of
torture
and
the
bloodshot
eyes
he
felt
no
desire
to
ask
for
an
explanation
but
went
straight
to
the
vaults
of
the
town
hall
to
have
some
dinner
and
meet
falander
falander
was
sitting
at
one
of
the
tables
calm
and
indifferent
as
if
he
were
prepared
for
the
worst
he
was
not
surprised
to
hear
that
rehnhjelm
had
been
engaged
although
this
news
considerably
increased
his
gloom
and
what
did
you
think
of
the
manager
he
asked
i
wanted
to
box
his
ears
but
i
had
the
courage
nor
has
the
management
and
therefore
he
rules
autocratically
brutality
always
rules
perhaps
you
know
that
he
is
a
playwright
as
well
as
all
the
rest
i
heard
about
it
he
writes
a
sort
of
historical
play
which
is
always
successful
the
reason
is
that
he
writes
parts
instead
of
creating
characters
he
manipulates
the
applause
at
the
exits
and
trades
on
patriotism
his
characters
never
talk
they
quarrel
men
and
women
old
and
young
all
of
them
for
this
reason
his
popular
piece
sons
of
king
is
rightly
called
a
historical
quarrel
in
five
acts
it
contains
no
action
nothing
but
quarrels
family
rows
street
brawls
scenes
in
parliament
and
so
on
questions
are
answered
by
sly
cuts
which
do
not
provoke
scenes
but
the
most
terrible
scuffles
there
is
no
dialogue
nothing
but
squabbling
in
which
the
characters
insult
each
other
and
the
highest
dramatic
effect
is
attained
by
blows
the
critics
call
his
characterisation
great
what
has
he
made
of
gustavus
vasa
in
the
play
i
just
mentioned
a
bragging
untenable
fellow
of
enormous
strength
at
the
meeting
of
parliament
at
västeros
he
breaks
a
table
with
his
fist
and
at
vadstena
he
kicks
a
door
panel
to
pieces
on
one
occasion
however
the
critics
said
there
was
no
meaning
in
his
plays
it
made
him
angry
and
he
resolved
to
write
comedies
with
plenty
of
meaning
he
had
a
boy
at
school
the
blackguard
married
who
had
been
playing
pranks
and
got
a
thrashing
immediately
his
father
wrote
a
comedy
in
which
he
drew
the
masters
and
exposed
the
inhuman
treatment
boys
receive
at
school
in
these
days
on
another
occasion
he
was
criticized
by
an
honest
reviewer
and
immediately
he
wrote
a
comedy
libelling
the
liberal
journalists
of
the
town
but
i
say
no
more
about
him
why
does
he
hate
you
because
i
said
at
a
rehearsal
don
pasquale
in
spite
of
his
maintaining
that
the
proper
pronunciation
was
pascal
result
i
was
ordered
on
penalty
of
a
fine
to
pronounce
the
word
in
way
it
was
immaterial
to
him
he
said
how
the
rest
of
the
world
pronounced
the
word
at
it
was
to
be
pronounced
pascal
because
it
was
his
wish
where
does
he
come
from
what
was
he
before
ca
you
guess
that
he
was
a
wheelwright
he
poison
you
if
he
thought
you
knew
it
but
let
us
change
the
subject
how
do
you
feel
after
last
night
revels
splendid
i
quite
forgot
to
thank
you
do
mention
it
are
you
fond
of
the
girl
i
mean
agnes
yes
i
very
fond
of
her
and
she
loves
you
that
all
right
then
take
her
what
nonsense
you
talk
we
could
be
married
for
a
long
time
who
told
you
to
be
married
what
are
you
driving
at
you
eighteen
she
sixteen
you
in
love
with
each
other
if
you
agreed
only
the
most
private
detail
is
wanting
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
are
you
trying
to
encourage
me
to
behave
like
a
scoundrel
towards
her
i
am
trying
to
encourage
you
to
obey
the
great
voice
of
nature
and
snap
your
fingers
at
the
petty
commands
of
men
it
only
envy
if
men
condemn
your
conduct
their
morality
is
nothing
but
malice
in
a
suitable
presentable
guise
has
nature
called
you
for
some
time
to
her
great
banquet
the
delight
of
the
gods
and
the
horror
of
society
afraid
of
having
to
pay
alimony
why
do
you
advise
me
to
marry
her
because
that
quite
another
thing
one
does
bind
oneself
for
life
after
having
spent
one
evening
together
it
does
follow
that
he
who
has
enjoyed
the
rapture
must
also
undergo
the
pain
matrimony
is
an
affair
of
souls
there
can
be
no
question
of
this
in
your
case
however
there
no
need
for
me
to
spur
you
on
the
inevitable
is
bound
to
happen
love
each
other
while
you
young
before
it
too
late
love
each
other
as
birds
love
without
worrying
about
how
to
furnish
a
home
love
as
the
flowers
of
the
species
dioecia
you
no
right
to
talk
disrespectfully
of
the
girl
she
is
good
innocent
and
to
be
pitied
and
whoever
denies
it
is
a
liar
have
you
ever
seen
more
innocent
eyes
than
hers
does
truth
proclaim
itself
in
the
sound
of
her
voice
she
is
worthy
of
a
great
and
pure
love
not
merely
of
the
passion
you
speak
of
do
ever
talk
to
me
about
her
in
this
way
again
you
can
tell
her
that
i
shall
look
upon
it
as
the
greatest
happiness
the
highest
honour
to
ask
her
to
marry
me
when
worthy
of
her
falander
shook
his
head
so
violently
that
the
snakes
on
his
forehead
wriggled
worthy
of
her
marriage
what
stuff
i
mean
it
dreadful
and
if
i
should
tell
you
that
the
girl
does
not
only
lack
all
the
qualities
which
you
ascribe
to
her
but
possesses
all
the
reverse
ones
you
would
believe
me
but
would
deprive
me
of
your
friendship
yes
the
world
is
so
full
of
lies
that
nobody
will
believe
a
man
when
he
speaks
the
truth
how
can
a
man
believe
you
who
have
no
morals
that
word
again
what
an
extraordinary
word
it
is
it
answers
all
questions
cuts
off
all
discussions
excuses
all
failings
one
own
not
those
of
others
strikes
down
all
adversaries
pleads
for
or
against
a
cause
just
like
a
lawyer
for
the
moment
you
have
defeated
me
with
it
next
time
i
shall
defeat
you
i
must
be
off
i
have
a
lesson
at
three
good
luck
and
he
left
rehnhjelm
to
his
dinner
and
his
reflections
when
falander
arrived
home
he
put
on
a
and
slippers
as
if
he
were
expecting
no
visitors
but
he
seemed
full
of
an
uncontrollable
restlessness
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
stopping
every
now
and
then
at
the
window
and
gazing
at
the
street
from
behind
the
curtain
after
a
while
he
stopped
before
the
took
his
collar
off
and
laid
it
on
the
sofa
table
for
a
few
more
minutes
he
continued
his
promenade
but
suddenly
coming
to
a
standstill
before
a
he
took
up
the
photograph
of
a
lady
placed
it
under
a
strong
magnifying
glass
and
examined
it
as
if
it
were
a
microscopic
slide
he
lingered
a
long
time
over
his
examination
presently
he
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
quickly
concealing
the
photograph
in
the
place
from
where
he
had
taken
it
he
jumped
up
and
went
and
sat
at
his
turning
his
back
to
the
door
he
was
apparently
absorbed
in
writing
when
a
knocking
two
short
gentle
raps
broke
the
silence
come
in
he
called
in
a
voice
which
was
anything
but
inviting
a
young
girl
small
but
entered
the
room
she
had
a
delicate
oval
face
surrounded
by
an
aureole
of
hair
which
might
have
been
bleached
by
the
sun
for
it
was
of
a
less
pronounced
tint
than
the
usual
natural
blond
the
constant
play
of
the
small
nose
and
exquisitely
cut
mouth
produced
roguish
curves
which
were
incessantly
changing
like
the
figures
in
a
kaleidoscope
when
for
instance
she
moved
the
wings
of
her
nose
so
that
the
bright
red
cartilage
showed
like
the
leaf
of
the
liverwort
her
lips
fell
apart
and
disclosed
the
edges
of
very
small
straight
teeth
which
although
her
own
were
too
white
and
even
to
inspire
confidence
her
eyes
were
drawn
up
at
the
root
of
the
nose
and
slanted
towards
the
temples
this
gave
them
a
pleading
pathetic
expression
which
stood
in
bewitching
contrast
to
the
lower
roguish
parts
of
her
face
she
had
restless
pupils
small
like
the
point
of
a
needle
at
one
moment
and
distended
at
the
next
like
the
objective
of
a
on
entering
the
room
she
removed
the
key
from
the
lock
and
shot
the
bolt
falander
remained
sitting
at
his
table
writing
you
are
late
agnes
he
said
yes

know
she
replied
defiantly
taking
off
her
hat

time

time

that
until

herself
back
on

and
exhibited
a
pair
of
elegant
little
boots
with
gold
tassels

ca

for

to
say
but
as
a
sensible
girl
oh
shut
up
she
took
up
a
paper
knife
and
threatened
him
in
fun
but
it
looked
very
much
as
if
she
were
in
earnest
you
are
very
beautiful
agnes
said
falander
why
has
it
never
struck
you
before
of
course
it
has
why
are
you
sighing
too
much
drink
last
night

me
look
at
you

matter

your
eyes

nap

ca

anyhow
i
must
be
off
i
really
only
came
to
tell
you
that
her
voice
softened
her
eyelids
dropped
slowly
like
the
curtain
after
a
death
scene
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
and
tell
me
that
it
all
over
said
falander
she
rose
and
pinned
on
her
hat
before
the
glass
have
you
any
scent
she
asked
not
here
at
the
theatre

should
stop
smoking
a
pipe

smell

about
one
clothes
i
will
she
stooped
and
fastened
her
garter
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
looking
at
falander
pleadingly
what
for
he
asked
as
she
made
no
reply
he
took
courage
and
drew
a
deep
breath
where
are
you
going
he
said
to
be
fitted
for
a
dress
you
need
be
afraid
she
replied
innocently
as
she
thought
falander
could
easily
tell
that
it
was
an
excuse
then
he
said
she
went
to
him
to
be
kissed
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
pressed
her
against
him
as
if
he
wanted
to
crush
her
then
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
led
her
to
the
door
pushed
her
outside
and
said
briefly
chapter
xvi
in
the
white
mountains
one
afternoon
in
august
falk
was
again
sitting
in
the
garden
on
moses
height
but
he
was
alone
and
he
had
been
alone
during
the
whole
summer
he
was
turning
over
in
his
mind
all
that
had
happened
to
him
during
the
three
months
which
had
passed
since
his
last
visit
when
his
heart
was
brimful
of
hope
courage
and
strength
he
felt
old
tired
indifferent
he
had
seen
the
houses
at
his
feet
from
the
inside
and
on
every
occasion
his
expectations
had
been
disappointed
he
had
seen
humanity
under
many
aspects
aspects
which
are
only
revealed
to
the
eye
of
the
poor
man
doctor
or
the
journalist
with
the
only
difference
that
the
journalist
generally
sees
men
as
they
wish
to
appear
and
the
doctor
as
they
are
he
had
every
opportunity
of
studying
man
as
a
social
animal
in
all
possible
guises
he
had
been
present
at
parliamentary
meetings
church
councils
general
meetings
of
shareholders
philanthropic
meetings
police
court
proceedings
festivals
funerals
public
meetings
of
working
men
everywhere
he
had
heard
big
words
and
many
words
words
never
used
in
daily
intercourse
a
particular
species
of
words
which
mean
nothing
at
least
not
what
they
ought
to
mean
this
had
given
him
a
conception
of
humanity
he
could
see
in
man
nothing
but
the
deceitful
social
animal
a
creature
he
is
bound
to
be
because
civilization
forbids
open
war
his
aloofness
blinded
him
to
the
existence
of
another
animal
an
animal
which
between
glass
and
wall
is
exceedingly
amiable
as
long
as
it
is
not
exasperated
and
which
is
ready
to
come
out
with
all
its
failings
and
weaknesses
when
there
are
no
witnesses
he
was
blind
to
it
and
that
was
the
reason
why
he
had
become
embittered
but
the
worst
of
it
all
was
he
had
lost
his
and
that
had
happened
without
his
having
committed
a
single
action
of
which
he
need
have
been
ashamed
he
had
been
robbed
of
it
by
his
and
it
had
not
been
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do
he
had
been
slighted
everywhere
and
how
could
he
whose
had
been
destroyed
in
his
early
youth
respect
a
person
whom
everybody
despised
with
many
a
bitter
pang
he
saw
that
all
conservative
journalists
that
was
to
say
men
who
defended
and
upheld
everything
that
was
wrong
or
if
they
could
not
defend
it
at
least
left
it
untouched
were
treated
with
the
utmost
courtesy
he
was
despised
not
so
much
as
a
pressman
as
in
his
character
of
advocate
of
all
those
who
were
and
hardly
dealt
with
he
had
lived
through
times
of
cruel
doubt
for
instance
in
reporting
the
general
meeting
of
shareholders
of
the
marine
insurance
society
triton
he
had
used
the
word
swindle
in
replying
to
his
report
the
had
published
a
long
article
proving
so
clearly
that
the
society
was
a
national
patriotic
philanthropic
institution
that
he
had
almost
felt
convinced
of
having
been
wrong
and
the
thought
of
having
recklessly
played
with
the
reputation
of
his
fellow
citizens
was
a
nightmare
to
him
for
many
days
to
come
he
was
now
in
a
state
of
mind
which
alternated
between
fanaticism
and
callousness
his
next
impulse
would
decide
the
direction
his
development
was
to
take
his
life
had
been
so
dreary
during
the
summer
that
he
welcomed
with
malicious
pleasure
every
rainy
day
and
it
was
a
comparatively
pleasant
sensation
to
watch
leaves
rustling
along
the
garden
paths
he
sat
absorbed
in
grimly
humorous
meditations
on
life
and
its
purposes
when
one
lean
bony
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
and
another
clutched
his
arm
he
felt
as
if
death
had
come
to
take
him
at
his
word
he
looked
up
and
started
before
him
stood
ygberg
pale
as
a
corpse
emaciated
and
looking
at
him
with
those
peculiarly
washed
out
eyes
which
only
starvation
produces
good
morning
falk
he
whispered
almost
inaudibly
and
his
whole
body
seemed
to
rattle
good
morning
ygberg
replied
falk
suddenly
brightening
up
sit
down
and
have
a
cup
of
coffee
how
are
you
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
lying
under
the
ice
oh
i
been
so
ill
so
ill
you
seem
to
have
had
as
jolly
a
summer
as
i
had
have
you
had
a
hard
time
too
asked
ygberg
a
faint
hope
that
it
had
been
the
case
brightening
his
yellow
face
i
can
only
say
thank
god
that
the
cursed
summer
is
over
it
might
be
winter
all
the
year
round
for
all
i
care
not
only
that
one
is
suffering
all
the
time
but
one
also
has
to
watch
others
enjoying
themselves
i
never
put
a
foot
out
of
town
did
you
i
have
seen
a
pine
tree
since
lundell
left
in
june
and
why
should
one
want
to
see
pine
trees
it
is
absolutely
essential
nor
is
a
pine
tree
anything
extraordinary
but
that
one
ca
have
the
pleasure
that
where
the
sting
comes
in
oh
well
never
mind
it
clouding
over
in
the
east
therefore
it
will
rain
and
when
the
sun
shines
again
it
will
be
autumn
your
health
ygberg
looked
at
the
punch
as
if
it
were
poison
but
he
drank
it
nevertheless
but
you
wrote
that
beautiful
story
of
the
guardian
angel
or
the
marine
insurance
society
for
smith
remarked
falk
it
go
against
your
convictions
convictions
i
have
no
convictions
have
you
no
only
fools
have
convictions
have
you
no
morals
ygberg
no
whenever
a
fool
has
an
idea
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
whether
it
is
original
or
not
he
calls
it
his
conviction
clings
to
it
and
boasts
of
it
not
because
it
is
conviction
but
because
it
is
conviction
so
far
as
the
marine
insurance
society
is
concerned
i
believe
it
a
swindle
i
sure
it
injures
many
men
the
shareholders
at
all
events
but
it
a
splendid
thing
for
others
the
directors
and
employés
for
instance
so
it
does
a
fair
amount
of
good
after
all
have
you
lost
all
sense
of
honour
old
friend
one
must
sacrifice
everything
on
the
altar
of
duty
i
admit
that
the
first
and
foremost
duty
of
man
is
to
live
to
live
at
any
price
divine
as
well
as
human
law
demands
it
one
must
never
sacrifice
honour
both
laws
as
i
said
demand
the
sacrifice
of
everything
they
compel
a
poor
man
to
sacrifice
his
honour
it
cruel
but
you
blame
the
poor
man
for
it
your
theory
of
life
is
anything
but
cheerful
how
could
it
be
otherwise
that
true
but
to
talk
of
something
else
i
had
a
letter
from
rehnhjelm
read
it
to
you
if
you
like
i
heard
he
had
gone
on
the
stage
yes
and
he
does
seem
to
be
having
a
good
time
of
it
ygberg
took
a
letter
from
his
put
a
piece
of
sugar
into
his
mouth
and
began
to
read
if
there
is
a
hell
in
a
life
after
this
which
is
very
doubtful
the
lad
become
a
it
can
not
be
a
worse
place
than
this
i
been
engaged
for
two
months
but
it
seems
to
me
like
two
years
a
devil
formerly
a
wheelwright
now
theatrical
manager
holds
my
fate
in
his
hand
and
treats
me
in
such
a
way
that
three
times
a
day
i
feel
tempted
to
run
away
but
he
has
so
carefully
drafted
the
penal
clauses
in
the
agreement
that
my
flight
would
dishonour
my
parents
name
i
have
every
single
night
but
i
never
been
allowed
to
open
my
lips
yet
for
twenty
consecutive
evenings
i
have
had
to
smear
my
face
with
umber
and
wear
a
gipsy
costume
not
a
single
piece
of
which
fits
me
the
tights
are
too
long
the
shoes
too
large
the
jacket
is
too
short
an
called
the
prompter
takes
good
care
that
i
do
exchange
my
costume
for
one
more
suitable
and
whenever
i
try
to
hide
myself
behind
the
crowd
which
is
made
up
of
the
factory
hands
it
opens
and
pushes
me
forward
to
the
footlights
if
i
look
into
the
wings
my
eyes
fall
on
the
standing
there
grinning
and
if
i
look
at
the
house
i
see
satan
himself
sitting
in
a
box
laughing
i
seem
to
have
been
engaged
for
his
amusement
not
for
the
purpose
of
playing
any
parts
on
one
occasion
i
ventured
to
draw
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
ought
to
have
practice
in
speaking
parts
if
i
was
ever
going
to
be
an
actor
he
lost
his
temper
and
said
that
one
must
learn
to
crawl
before
one
can
learn
to
walk
i
replied
that
i
could
walk
he
said
it
was
a
lie
and
asked
me
whether
i
imagined
that
the
art
of
acting
the
most
beautiful
and
difficult
of
all
arts
required
no
training
when
i
said
that
that
was
exactly
what
i
did
imagine
and
that
i
was
impatiently
waiting
for
the
beginning
of
my
training
he
told
me
i
was
an
ignorant
puppy
and
he
would
kick
me
out
when
i
remonstrated
he
asked
me
whether
i
looked
upon
the
stage
as
a
refuge
for
impecunious
youths
my
reply
was
a
frank
unconditional
glad
yes
he
roared
that
he
would
kill
me
this
is
the
present
state
of
my
affairs
i
feel
that
my
soul
is
flickering
out
like
a
tallow
candle
in
a
draught
and
i
shall
soon
believe
that
will
be
victorious
even
though
it
be
concealed
in
clouds
as
the
catechism
has
it
but
the
worst
of
all
is
that
i
have
lost
all
respect
for
this
art
which
was
the
dream
and
the
love
of
my
boyhood
can
i
help
it
when
i
see
that
men
and
women
without
education
or
culture
spurred
on
by
vanity
and
recklessness
completely
lacking
in
enthusiasm
and
intelligence
are
able
to
play
in
a
few
months
time
character
parts
historical
parts
fairly
well
without
having
a
glimmer
of
knowledge
of
the
time
in
which
they
move
or
the
important
part
which
the
person
they
represent
played
in
history
it
is
slow
murder
and
the
association
with
this
mob
which
keeps
me
down
some
of
the
members
of
the
company
have
come
into
collision
with
various
paragraphs
of
the
penal
code
is
making
of
me
what
i
never
been
an
aristocrat
the
pressure
of
the
cultured
can
never
weigh
as
heavily
on
the
uncultured
there
is
but
one
ray
of
light
in
this
darkness
i
am
in
love
she
is
purest
gold
among
all
this
dross
of
course
she
too
is
persecuted
and
slowly
murdered
just
as
i
am
since
she
refused
the
infamous
proposals
she
is
the
only
woman
with
a
living
spirit
among
all
these
beasts
wallowing
in
filth
and
she
loves
me
with
all
her
soul
we
are
secretly
engaged
i
am
only
waiting
for
the
day
when
i
shall
have
won
success
to
make
her
my
wife
but
when
will
that
be
we
have
often
thought
of
dying
together
but
hope
treacherous
hope
has
always
beguiled
us
into
continuing
this
misery
to
see
my
innocent
love
burning
with
shame
when
she
is
forced
to
wear
improper
costumes
is
more
than
i
can
bear
but
i
will
drop
this
unpleasant
subject
olle
and
lundell
wish
to
be
remembered
olle
is
very
much
changed
he
has
drifted
into
a
new
kind
of
philosophy
which
tears
down
everything
and
turns
all
things
upside
down
it
sounds
very
jolly
and
sometimes
seems
true
but
it
must
be
a
dangerous
doctrine
if
carried
out
i
believe
he
owes
these
ideas
to
one
of
the
actors
here
an
intelligent
and
man
who
lives
a
very
immoral
life
i
like
and
hate
him
at
the
same
time
he
is
a
queer
chap
fundamentally
good
noble
and
generous
a
man
who
will
sacrifice
himself
for
his
friends
i
can
not
fix
on
any
special
vice
but
he
is
immoral
and
a
man
without
morality
is
a
blackguard
do
you
think
so
i
must
stop
my
angel
my
good
spirit
is
coming
there
is
a
happy
hour
in
store
for
me
all
evil
spirits
will
flee
and
i
shall
be
a
better
man
remember
me
to
falk
and
tell
him
to
think
of
me
when
life
is
hard
on
him
your
friend
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
it
the
old
story
of
the
struggle
of
the
wild
beasts
i
tell
you
what
ygberg
i
believe
one
has
to
be
very
unscrupulous
if
one
wants
to
get
on
in
the
world
try
it
you
may
not
find
it
so
easy
are
you
still
doing
business
with
smith
no
unfortunately
not
and
you
i
seen
him
on
the
subject
of
my
poems
he
has
bought
them
ten
crowns
the
folio
and
he
can
now
murder
me
in
the
same
way
as
the
wheelwright
is
murdering
rehnhjelm
and
i
afraid
something
of
the
sort
is
going
to
happen
for
i
have
heard
a
word
about
them
he
was
so
exceedingly
friendly
that
i
expect
the
worst
if
only
i
knew
going
on
but
what
the
matter
with
you
you
as
white
as
a
sheet
the
truth
is
replied
ygberg
clutching
the
railings
all
i
had
to
eat
these
last
two
days
has
been
five
lumps
of
sugar
i
afraid
going
to
faint
if
food
will
set
you
right
i
can
help
you
fortunately
i
have
some
money
of
course
it
will
set
me
right
whispered
ygberg
faintly
but
it
was
not
so
when
they
were
sitting
in
the
and
food
was
served
to
them
ygberg
grew
worse
and
falk
had
to
take
him
to
his
room
which
fortunately
was
not
very
far
off
the
house
was
an
old
house
built
of
wood
it
had
climbed
on
to
a
rock
and
looked
as
if
it
suffered
from
it
was
spotted
like
a
leper
a
long
time
ago
it
was
going
to
be
painted
but
when
the
old
paint
had
been
burned
off
nothing
more
was
done
to
it
it
looked
in
every
respect
miserable
and
it
was
hard
to
believe
the
legend
of
the
sign
of
the
fire
insurance
office
rusting
on
the
wall
namely
that
a
phoenix
should
rise
from
the
ashes
at
the
base
of
the
house
grew
dandelions
nettles
and
roadweed
the
faithful
companions
of
poverty
sparrows
were
bathing
in
the
scorching
sand
and
scattering
it
about
children
with
big
stomachs
looking
as
if
they
were
being
brought
up
on
per
cent
of
water
were
making
dandelion
chains
and
trying
to
embitter
their
sad
lives
by
annoying
and
insulting
each
other
falk
and
ygberg
climbed
a
rotten
creaking
staircase
and
came
to
a
large
room
it
was
divided
into
three
parts
by
chalk
lines
the
first
and
second
divisions
served
a
joiner
and
a
cobbler
as
workshops
the
third
was
exclusively
devoted
to
the
more
intimate
pursuits
of
family
life
whenever
the
children
screamed
which
happened
once
in
every
quarter
of
an
hour
the
joiner
flew
into
a
rage
and
burst
out
scolding
and
swearing
the
cobbler
remonstrated
with
quotations
from
the
bible
the
joiner
nerves
were
so
shattered
by
these
constant
screams
the
unceasing
punishments
and
scoldings
that
five
minutes
after
partaking
of
the
snuff
of
reconciliation
offered
by
the
cobbler
he
flew
into
a
fresh
temper
in
spite
of
his
firm
resolve
to
be
patient
consequently
he
was
nearly
all
day
long
in
a
fury
but
the
worst
passages
were
when
he
asked
the
woman
why
these
infernal
females
need
bring
so
many
children
into
the
world
then
the
woman
in
question
came
on
the
tapis
and
his
antagonist
gave
him
as
good
as
he
brought
falk
and
ygberg
had
to
pass
this
room
to
gain
the
latter
garret
and
although
both
of
them
went
on
tiptoe
they
wakened
two
of
the
children
immediately
the
mother
began
humming
a
lullaby
thereby
interrupting
a
discussion
between
cobbler
and
joiner
naturally
the
latter
nearly
had
a
fit
hold
your
tongue
woman
hold
your
tongue
yourself
ca
you
let
the
children
sleep
to
hell
with
the
children
are
they
my
children
am
i
to
suffer
for
other
people
immorality
am
i
an
immoral
man
what
have
i
any
children
hold
your
tongue
i
say
or
i
throw
my
plane
at
your
head
i
say
master
master
began
the
cobbler
you
should
talk
like
that
of
the
children
god
sends
the
little
ones
into
the
world
that
a
lie
cobbler
the
devil
sends
them
the
devil
and
then
the
dissolute
parents
blame
god
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
master
master
you
should
use
such
language
scripture
tells
us
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
belongs
to
the
children
oh
indeed
they
have
them
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
have
they
how
dare
you
talk
like
that
shrilled
the
furious
mother
if
you
ever
have
any
children
of
your
own
i
shall
pray
that
they
may
be
lame
and
diseased
i
shall
pray
that
they
shall
be
blind
and
deaf
and
dumb
i
shall
pray
that
they
shall
be
sent
to
the
reformatory
and
end
on
the
gallows
see
if
i
wo
do
so
for
all
i
care
you
hussy
i
not
going
to
bring
children
into
the
world
to
see
them
living
a
dog
life
you
ought
to
be
sent
to
the
house
of
correction
for
bringing
the
poor
things
into
all
this
misery
you
are
married
you
say
well
need
you
be
immoral
because
you
are
married
master
master
god
sends
the
children
it
a
lie
cobbler
i
read
in
a
paper
the
other
day
that
the
damned
potato
is
to
blame
for
the
large
families
of
the
poor
do
you
see
the
potato
consists
of
two
substances
called
oxygen
and
nitrogen
whenever
these
substances
occur
in
a
certain
quantity
and
proportion
women
become
prolific
but
what
is
one
to
do
asked
the
angry
mother
whom
this
interesting
explanation
had
calmed
down
a
little
one
should
eat
potatoes
ca
you
see
that
but
what
is
one
to
eat
if
not
potatoes
woman
steak
and
onions
what
is
that
good
or
steak
à
la
châteaubriand
do
you
know
what
that
is
what
i
saw
in
the
the
other
day
that
a
woman
who
had
taken
very
nearly
died
as
well
as
the
baby
what
that
asked
the
mother
pricking
up
her
ears
you
like
to
know
would
you
is
it
true
what
you
just
said
about
asked
the
cobbler
blinking
his
eyes
hoho
that
brings
up
your
lungs
and
liver
but
there
a
heavy
penalty
on
it
and
that
as
it
should
be
is
it
as
it
should
be
asked
the
cobbler
dully
of
course
it
is
immorality
must
be
punished
and
it
immoral
to
murder
one
children
children
surely
there
a
difference
replied
the
angry
mother
resignedly
but
where
does
the
stuff
you
just
spoke
about
come
from
master
haha
you
want
more
children
you
hussy
although
you
are
a
widow
with
five
beware
of
that
devil
of
a
cobbler
he
hard
on
women
in
spite
of
his
piety
a
pinch
of
snuff
cobbler
there
is
really
a
herb
then
who
said
it
was
a
herb
did
i
say
so
no
it
an
organic
substance
let
me
tell
you
all
substances
nature
contains
about
sixty
are
divided
into
organic
and
inorganic
substances
this
one
latin
name
is
cornuticus
secalias
it
comes
from
abroad
for
instance
from
the
calabrian
peninsula
is
it
very
expensive
master
asked
the
cobbler
expensive
ejaculated
the
joiner
manipulating
his
plane
as
if
it
were
a
carbine
it
awfully
expensive
falk
had
listened
to
the
conversation
with
great
interest
now
he
started
he
had
heard
a
carriage
stopping
underneath
the
window
and
the
sound
of
two
women
voices
which
seemed
familiar
to
him
this
house
looks
all
right
does
it
said
an
older
voice
i
think
it
looks
dreadful
i
meant
it
looks
all
right
for
our
purpose
do
you
know
driver
whether
any
poor
people
are
living
in
this
house
i
do
know
replied
the
driver
but
i
stake
my
oath
on
it
swearing
is
a
sin
so
you
had
better
not
wait
for
us
here
while
we
go
upstairs
to
do
our
duty
i
say
eugenia
had
we
better
first
talk
a
little
to
the
children
down
here
said
homan
to
falk
lagging
behind
perhaps
it
would
be
just
as
well
come
here
little
boy
what
your
name
albert
answered
a
little
lad
of
six
do
you
know
jesus
my
laddie
no
answered
the
child
with
a
laugh
and
put
a
finger
into
his
mouth
terrible
said
falk
taking
out
her
i
better
say
parish
of
catherine
white
mountains
profound
spiritual
darkness
in
the
minds
of
the
young
i
suppose
darkness
is
the
right
word
she
turned
to
the
little
fellow
and
do
you
want
to
know
him
no
would
you
like
a
penny
yes
you
should
say
please
indescribably
neglected
but
i
succeeded
by
gentleness
in
awakening
their
better
feelings
what
a
horrible
smell
let
go
eugenia
implored
homan
they
went
upstairs
and
entered
the
large
room
without
knocking
the
joiner
seized
his
plane
and
began
planing
a
knotty
board
so
that
the
ladies
had
to
shout
to
make
themselves
heard
is
anybody
here
thirsting
for
salvation
shouted
homan
while
falk
worked
her
so
vigorously
that
the
children
began
to
cry
with
the
smarting
of
their
eyes
are
you
offering
us
salvation
lady
asked
the
joiner
interrupting
his
work
where
did
you
get
it
from
perhaps
there
charity
to
be
had
too
and
humiliation
and
pride
you
are
a
ruffian
you
will
be
damned
answered
homan
falk
made
notes
in
her
he
all
right
she
remarked
is
there
anything
else
you
like
to
say
asked
homan
we
know
the
sort
you
are
perhaps
you
like
to
talk
to
me
about
religion
ladies
i
can
talk
on
any
subject
have
you
ever
heard
anything
about
the
councils
held
at
nicæa
or
the
smalcaldic
articles
we
know
nothing
about
that
my
good
man
why
do
you
call
me
good
scripture
says
nobody
is
good
but
god
alone
so
you
know
nothing
about
the
nicene
council
ladies
how
can
you
dare
to
teach
others
when
you
know
nothing
yourselves
and
if
you
want
to
dispense
charity
do
it
while
i
turn
my
back
to
you
for
true
charity
is
given
secretly
practise
on
the
children
if
you
like
they
defend
themselves
but
leave
us
in
peace
give
us
work
and
pay
us
a
just
wage
and
then
you
need
run
about
like
this
a
pinch
of
snuff
cobbler
shall
i
write
great
unbelief
quite
hardened
evelyn
asked
falk
i
should
put
dear
what
are
you
writing
down
ladies
our
sins
surely
your
book
too
small
for
that
the
outcome
of
the
working
men
unions
very
good
said
homan
beware
of
the
working
men
unions
said
the
joiner
for
hundreds
of
years
war
has
been
made
upon
the
kings
but
now
we
discovered
that
the
kings
are
not
to
blame
the
next
campaign
will
be
against
all
idlers
who
live
on
the
work
of
others
then
we
shall
see
something
that
enough
said
the
cobbler
the
angry
mother
whose
eyes
had
been
riveted
on
falk
during
the
whole
scene
took
the
opportunity
of
putting
in
a
word
excuse
me
but
are
you
mrs
falk
she
asked
no
answered
that
lady
with
an
assurance
which
took
even
breath
away
but
you
as
like
her
as
its
possible
to
be
i
knew
her
father
ronock
who
now
on
the
flagship
that
all
very
nice
but
it
does
concern
us
are
there
any
other
people
in
this
house
who
need
salvation
no
said
the
joiner
they
do
need
salvation
they
need
food
and
clothes
or
better
still
work
much
work
and
work
but
the
ladies
had
better
not
go
and
see
them
for
one
of
them
is
down
with
screamed
homan
and
nobody
said
a
word
about
it
come
along
eugenia
let
at
once
inform
the
police
what
a
disgusting
set
of
people
they
are
but
the
children
whose
children
are
these
answer
said
falk
holding
up
her
pencil
threateningly
they
mine
lady
answered
the
mother
but
your
husband
where
your
husband
disappeared
said
the
joiner
we
set
the
police
on
his
track
he
shall
be
sent
to
the
penitentiary
things
must
be
changed
here
i
said
it
was
a
good
house
evelyn
wo
the
ladies
sit
down
asked
the
joiner
it
so
much
easier
to
keep
up
a
conversation
sitting
down
we
no
chairs
but
that
matter
we
no
beds
either
they
went
for
taxes
for
the
lighting
of
the
street
so
that
you
need
not
go
home
from
the
theatre
in
the
dark
we
no
gas
as
you
can
see
for
yourselves
they
went
in
payment
of
the
so
that
your
servants
should
be
saved
running
up
and
down
stairs
the
water
not
laid
on
here
they
went
towards
the
keeping
up
of
the
hospitals
so
that
your
sons
will
not
be
laid
up
at
home
when
come
away
eugenia
for
god
sake
this
is
unbearable
i
agree
with
you
ladies
it
is
unbearable
said
the
joiner
and
the
day
will
come
when
things
will
be
worse
on
that
day
we
shall
come
down
from
the
white
mountains
with
a
great
noise
like
a
waterfall
and
ask
for
the
return
of
our
beds
ask
we
shall
take
them
and
you
shall
lie
on
wooden
benches
as
i
had
to
do
and
eat
potatoes
until
your
stomachs
are
as
tight
as
a
drum
and
you
feel
as
if
you
had
undergone
the
torture
by
water
as
we
but
the
ladies
had
fled
leaving
behind
them
a
pile
of
pamphlets
ugh
what
a
beastly
smell
of
it
smells
of
prostitutes
said
the
joiner
a
pinch
of
snuff
cobbler
he
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
blue
apron
and
took
up
his
plane
while
the
others
reflected
silently
ygberg
who
had
been
asleep
during
the
whole
of
the
scene
now
awoke
and
made
ready
to
go
out
again
with
falk
once
more
homan
voice
floated
through
the
open
window
what
did
she
mean
when
she
said
your
father
was
on
the
flagship
your
father
is
a
captain
is
he
that
what
he
called
it
the
same
thing
were
they
an
insolent
crowd
i
never
go
there
again
but
it
will
make
a
fine
report
to
the
restaurant
hasselbacken
driver
chapter
xvii
natura
falander
was
at
home
studying
a
part
one
afternoon
when
he
was
disturbed
by
a
gentle
tapping
two
at
his
door
he
jumped
up
hastily
donned
a
coat
and
opened
agnes
this
is
a
rare
visit
i
had
to
come
and
see
you
it
so
damned
slow
what
dreadful
language
let
me
curse
it
relieves
my
feelings
hm
hm
give
me
a
cigar
i
have
had
a
smoke
these
last
six
weeks
this
education
makes
me
frantic
is
he
so
severe
curse
him
for
shame
agnes
i
been
forbidden
to
smoke
to
curse
to
drink
punch
to
go
out
in
the
evening
but
wait
until
we
are
married
i
let
him
see
is
he
really
serious
about
it
absolutely
look
at
this
handkerchief
with
a
crown
and
nine
balls
our
initials
are
the
same
and
he
making
me
use
his
design
is
it
lovely
yes
very
nice
it
gone
as
far
as
that
has
it
the
angel
dressed
in
blue
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
and
puffed
at
her
cigar
falander
looked
at
her
body
as
if
he
were
making
an
estimate
and
said
will
you
have
a
glass
of
punch
rather
are
you
in
love
with
your
fiancé
he
does
belong
to
the
class
of
men
with
whom
one
can
really
be
in
love
but
i
do
know
love
hm
what
is
love
yes
what
is
it
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
he
very
respectable
awfully
respectable
but
but
but
but
he
so
proper
she
looked
at
falander
with
a
smile
which
would
have
saved
the
absent
fiancé
if
he
could
have
seen
it
he
is
demonstrative
enough
asked
falander
curiously
in
an
unsteady
voice
she
drank
her
glass
of
punch
paused
shook
her
head
and
said
with
a
theatrical
sigh
no
the
reply
seemed
to
satisfy
falander
it
obviously
relieved
him
he
continued
his
it
may
be
a
long
time
before
you
can
get
married
he
never
played
a
single
part
yet
no
i
know
wo
you
find
the
waiting
dull
one
must
be
patient
i
must
use
the
thumbscrew
thought
falander
i
suppose
you
know
that
jenny
and
i
are
lovers
the
ugly
old
hag
a
whole
shower
of
white
northern
lights
flamed
across
her
face
and
every
muscle
twitched
as
if
she
were
under
the
influence
of
a
galvanic
battery
she
is
as
old
as
all
that
said
falander
coldly
have
you
heard
that
the
waiter
gustav
is
going
to
play
don
diego
in
the
new
piece
and
that
rehnhjelm
has
been
given
the
part
of
his
servant
the
waiter
is
bound
to
have
a
success
for
the
part
plays
itself
but
poor
rehnhjelm
will
die
with
shame
good
heavens
is
it
true
it
true
enough
it
sha
happen
who
to
prevent
it
she
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
emptied
her
glass
and
began
to
sob
wildly
oh
how
bitter
the
world
is
how
bitter
she
sobbed
it
just
as
if
an
evil
power
were
spying
on
us
finding
out
our
wishes
merely
to
cross
them
discerning
our
hopes
so
as
to
shatter
them
anticipating
our
thoughts
so
as
to
paralyse
them
if
it
were
possible
to
long
for
evil
to
happen
to
oneself
one
ought
to
do
it
just
for
the
sake
of
making
a
fool
of
that
power
quite
true
my
dear
therefore
one
should
always
be
prepared
for
a
bad
ending
but
that
not
the
worst
i
give
you
a
thought
which
will
comfort
you
you
know
that
every
success
you
attain
entails
someone
else
failure
if
you
are
given
a
part
to
play
some
other
woman
is
disappointed
it
makes
her
writhe
like
a
worm
trodden
under
foot
and
without
knowing
it
you
have
committed
a
wrong
therefore
even
happiness
is
poisoned
be
comforted
in
misfortune
by
the
thought
that
every
piece
of
which
falls
to
your
share
is
equivalent
to
a
good
action
even
though
it
be
a
good
action
committed
without
your
knowing
it
and
the
thought
of
a
good
action
is
the
only
pure
enjoyment
which
is
given
to
us
mortals
i
do
want
to
do
any
good
actions
i
do
want
any
pure
joys
i
have
the
same
right
to
success
as
everybody
else
and
i
will
be
successful
at
any
price
i
wo
play
your
mistress
maid
at
any
price
you
jealous
learn
to
bear
failure
gracefully
that
greater
and
much
more
interesting
tell
me
one
thing
is
she
in
love
with
you
i
afraid
she
loves
me
only
too
well
and
you
i
i
shall
never
love
any
woman
but
you
he
seized
her
hand
she
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
showing
her
stockings
do
you
believe
in
what
is
called
love
she
asked
gazing
at
him
with
distended
pupils
i
believe
there
are
several
kinds
of
love
she
crossed
the
room
towards
the
door
do
you
love
me
wholly
and
entirely
she
put
her
hand
on
the
he
pondered
for
two
seconds
then
he
replied
your
soul
is
evil
and
i
do
love
evil
i
do
care
a
fig
for
my
soul
do
you
love
me
me
yes
so
deeply
why
did
you
send
me
rehnhjelm
because
i
wanted
to
find
out
what
life
without
you
would
be
like
did
you
lie
when
you
said
you
were
tired
of
me
yes
i
lied
oh
you
old
devil
she
took
the
key
out
of
the
lock
and
he
drew
down
the
blind
chapter
xviii
nihilism
as
falk
was
walking
home
one
rainy
september
evening
and
turning
into
he
saw
to
his
amazement
that
his
windows
were
lit
up
when
he
was
near
enough
to
be
able
to
cast
a
glance
into
his
room
from
below
he
noticed
on
the
ceiling
the
shadow
of
a
man
which
seemed
familiar
although
he
could
not
place
it
it
was
a
shadow
and
the
nearer
he
came
the
more
despondent
it
looked
on
entering
his
room
he
saw
struve
sitting
at
his
with
his
head
on
his
hands
his
clothes
were
soaked
with
rain
and
clung
heavily
to
his
body
there
were
little
puddles
on
the
floor
which
slowly
drained
off
through
the
chinks
his
hair
hung
in
damp
strands
from
his
head
and
his
usually
english
whiskers
fell
like
stalactites
on
his
damp
coat
collar
he
had
placed
his
black
hat
beside
him
on
the
table
it
had
collapsed
under
its
own
weight
and
the
wide
crape
band
which
it
was
wearing
suggested
that
it
was
mourning
for
its
lost
youth
good
evening
said
falk
this
is
an
unexpected
honour
do
jeer
at
me
begged
struve
and
why
not
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
spare
you
i
see
you
done
yes
i
shall
turn
conservative
too
before
long
you
in
mourning
i
see
i
hope
i
may
congratulate
you
i
lost
a
little
son
then
i
congratulate
him
but
what
do
you
want
here
you
know
i
despise
you
i
expect
you
do
yourself
do
you
of
course
i
do
but
is
life
bitter
enough
without
our
unnecessarily
embittering
it
still
further
if
god
or
providence
is
amused
at
it
need
it
follow
that
man
should
equally
degrade
himself
that
sounds
reasonable
and
does
you
honour
wo
you
put
on
my
while
you
are
drying
your
clothes
you
must
be
cold
thank
you
but
i
must
stay
oh
stay
a
little
while
it
will
give
us
a
chance
of
having
things
out
i
do
like
talking
about
my
misfortunes
then
talk
about
your
crimes
i
have
committed
any
oh
yes
you
have
you
have
committed
great
crimes
you
have
put
your
heavy
hand
on
the
oppressed
you
have
kicked
the
wounded
you
have
sneered
at
the
wretched
do
you
remember
the
last
strike
when
you
were
on
the
side
of
power
the
side
of
the
law
brother
haha
the
law
who
has
dictated
the
law
which
governs
the
life
of
the
poor
man
you
fool
the
rich
man
that
is
to
say
the
master
made
the
law
for
the
slave
the
law
was
dictated
by
the
whole
nation
and
the
universal
sense
of
right
god
gave
the
law
save
your
big
words
when
you
talk
to
me
who
wrote
the
law
of
kronstedt
who
is
responsible
for
the
law
of
corporal
punishment
colonel
sabelman
it
was
his
bill
and
his
friends
who
formed
the
majority
at
that
time
pushed
it
through
colonel
sabelman
is
not
the
nation
and
his
friends
are
not
the
universal
sense
of
right
who
is
responsible
for
the
law
concerning
joint
stock
companies
judge
svindelgren
who
is
responsible
for
the
new
parliamentary
laws
assessor
vallonius
who
has
written
the
law
of
protection
that
is
to
say
the
protection
of
the
rich
from
the
just
claims
of
the
poor
wholesale
merchant
grocer
do
talk
to
me
i
know
your
claptrap
who
has
written
the
new
law
of
succession
criminals
the
forest
laws
thieves
the
law
relating
to
bills
of
private
banks
swindlers
and
you
maintain
that
god
has
done
it
poor
god
may
i
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
bought
with
my
own
experience
advice
which
will
be
useful
to
you
all
your
life
if
you
want
to
escape
a
fate
which
in
your
fanaticism
you
are
fast
approaching
change
your
point
of
view
as
soon
as
possible
take
a
view
of
the
world
and
you
will
see
how
small
and
insignificant
everything
is
start
with
the
conviction
that
the
whole
world
is
a
rubbish
heap
that
men
are
the
refuse
no
better
than
carrot
stalks
cabbage
leaves
rags
then
nothing
will
take
you
by
surprise
you
will
never
lose
an
illusion
but
on
the
contrary
you
will
be
filled
with
a
great
joy
whenever
you
come
across
a
fine
thought
a
good
action
try
to
acquire
a
calm
contempt
of
the
world
you
need
be
afraid
of
growing
callous
i
have
not
yet
attained
to
that
point
of
view
it
true
but
i
have
a
contempt
for
the
world
but
that
is
my
misfortune
for
directly
i
hear
of
a
single
act
of
generosity
or
kindness
i
love
humanity
again
and
overrate
my
fellowmen
only
to
be
deceived
afresh
be
more
selfish
let
the
devil
take
your
fellowmen
i
afraid
i
ca
try
another
profession
join
your
brother
he
seems
to
get
on
in
this
world
i
saw
him
yesterday
at
the
church
council
of
the
parish
of
st
nicholas
at
the
church
council
yes
that
man
has
a
future
the
pastor
primarius
nodded
to
him
soon
be
an
alderman
like
all
landed
proprietors
what
about
the
they
work
with
debentures
now
but
your
brother
has
lost
anything
by
it
even
though
he
has
made
anything
no
he
other
fish
to
fry
do
let
us
talk
of
that
man
but
he
your
brother
that
is
his
merit
but
now
tell
me
what
you
want
my
boy
funeral
is
and
i
have
no
i
lend
you
mine
thank
you
brother
you
extricating
me
from
an
awkward
position
that
was
one
thing
but
there
is
something
else
of
a
rather
more
delicate
nature
why
come
to
me
your
enemy
with
your
delicate
confidences
surprised
because
you
are
a
man
of
heart
do
build
on
that
any
longer
but
go
on
how
irritable
you
grown
you
not
the
same
man
you
used
to
be
so
gentle
we
discussed
that
before
speak
up
i
want
to
ask
you
whether
you
would
come
with
me
to
the
churchyard
i
why
do
you
ask
one
of
your
colleagues
from
the
there
are
reasons
i
do
see
why
i
should
tell
you
i
not
married
not
married
you
the
defender
of
religion
and
morality
have
broken
the
sacred
bonds
poverty
the
force
of
circumstances
but
i
just
as
happy
as
if
i
were
married
i
love
my
wife
and
she
loves
me
and
that
all
but
there
another
reason
the
child
has
not
been
baptized
it
was
three
weeks
old
when
it
died
and
therefore
no
clergyman
will
bury
it
i
do
dare
to
tell
this
to
my
wife
because
she
would
fret
i
told
her
the
clergyman
would
meet
us
in
the
churchyard
i
telling
you
this
to
prevent
a
possible
scene
she
of
course
will
remain
at
home
you
only
meet
two
other
fellows
one
of
them
levi
is
a
younger
brother
of
the
director
of
the
and
one
of
the
employés
of
that
society
he
a
decent
sort
with
an
unusually
good
head
and
a
still
better
heart
do
laugh
i
can
see
that
you
think
borrowed
money
from
him
and
so
i
have
he
a
man
you
like
the
other
one
is
my
old
friend
borg
who
treated
the
little
one
he
is
very
a
man
without
any
prejudices
you
get
on
with
him
i
can
count
on
you
ca
i
there
be
four
of
us
in
the
coach
and
the
little
coffin
of
course
very
well
i
come
there
one
more
thing
my
wife
has
religious
scruples
and
is
afraid
that
the
little
one
wo
go
to
heaven
because
he
died
without
baptism
she
asks
everybody
opinion
on
the
subject
so
as
to
ease
her
mind
but
what
about
the
augsburg
confession
it
not
a
question
of
confessions
but
in
writing
to
your
paper
you
always
uphold
the
official
faith
the
paper
is
the
affair
of
the
syndicate
if
it
likes
to
cling
to
christianity
it
may
do
so
for
all
i
care
my
work
for
the
syndicate
is
a
matter
apart
please
agree
with
my
wife
if
she
tells
you
that
she
believes
that
her
child
will
go
to
heaven
i
do
mind
denying
the
faith
in
order
to
make
a
human
heart
happy
particularly
as
i
do
hold
it
but
you
have
told
me
yet
where
you
live
do
you
know
where
the
white
mountains
are
yes
are
you
living
in
the
spotted
house
on
the
mountain
rock
do
you
know
it
i
been
there
once
then
perhaps
you
know
ygberg
the
socialist
who
leads
the
people
astray
i
am
the
landlord
deputy
smith
owns
the
property
i
live
there
rent
free
on
condition
that
i
collect
the
rents
whenever
the
rents
are
not
forthcoming
the
people
talk
nonsense
which
he
has
put
into
their
heads
about
capital
and
labour
and
other
things
which
fill
the
columns
of
the
socialistic
press
falk
did
not
reply
do
you
know
ygberg
yes
i
do
but
wo
you
try
on
my
now
struve
tried
it
on
put
his
own
damp
coat
over
it
buttoned
it
up
to
the
chin
lit
the
end
of
his
cigar
impaled
on
a
match
and
went
falk
lighted
him
downstairs
you
a
long
way
to
go
he
said
merely
to
say
something
the
lord
knows
it
and
i
have
no
umbrella
and
no
overcoat
would
you
like
my
winter
coat
many
thanks
it
very
kind
of
you
you
can
return
it
to
me
by
and
by
he
went
back
to
his
room
fetched
the
overcoat
and
gave
it
to
struve
who
was
waiting
in
the
entrance
hall
after
a
brief
they
parted
falk
found
the
atmosphere
in
his
room
stifling
he
opened
the
window
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
torrents
splashing
on
the
tiles
and
running
down
into
the
dirty
street
tattoo
sounded
in
the
barracks
opposite
vespers
were
being
sung
in
the
lodgment
fragments
of
the
verses
floated
through
the
open
window
falk
felt
lonely
and
tired
he
had
been
longing
to
fight
a
battle
with
a
representative
of
all
he
regarded
as
inimical
to
progress
but
the
enemy
after
having
to
some
extent
beaten
him
had
fled
he
tried
to
understand
clearly
what
the
quarrel
was
about
but
failed
in
his
effort
he
was
unable
to
say
who
was
right
he
asked
himself
whether
the
cause
he
served
namely
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
had
any
existence
but
at
the
next
moment
he
reproached
himself
with
cowardice
and
the
steady
fanaticism
which
glowed
in
him
burst
into
fresh
flames
he
condemned
the
weakness
which
again
and
again
had
induced
him
to
yield
just
now
he
had
held
the
enemy
in
his
hand
and
not
only
had
he
not
shown
him
his
profound
repugnance
but
he
had
even
treated
him
with
kindness
and
sympathy
what
would
he
think
of
him
there
was
no
merit
in
this
good
nature
as
it
prevented
him
from
coming
to
a
firm
decision
it
was
nothing
but
moral
laxity
making
him
incapable
of
taking
up
a
fight
which
seemed
more
and
more
beyond
him
he
realized
that
he
must
extinguish
the
fire
under
the
boilers
they
would
not
be
able
to
stand
the
pressure
as
no
steam
was
being
used
he
pondered
over
struve
advice
and
brooded
until
his
mind
was
chaos
in
which
truth
and
lies
right
and
wrong
danced
together
in
complete
harmony
his
brain
in
which
owing
to
his
academic
training
all
conceptions
had
been
so
neatly
would
soon
resemble
a
pack
of
cards
he
succeeded
beyond
expectation
in
working
himself
into
a
state
of
complete
indifference
he
looked
for
fine
motives
in
the
actions
of
his
enemies
and
gradually
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
had
all
along
been
in
the
wrong
he
felt
reconciled
to
the
existing
order
of
things
and
ultimately
came
to
the
fine
conclusion
that
it
was
quite
immaterial
whether
the
whole
was
black
or
white
whatever
was
had
to
be
he
was
not
entitled
to
criticize
it
he
found
this
mood
pleasant
it
gave
him
a
feeling
of
restfulness
to
which
he
had
been
a
stranger
all
those
years
during
which
he
had
made
the
troubles
of
humanity
his
own
he
was
enjoying
this
calm
and
a
pipe
of
strong
tobacco
when
a
maid
servant
brought
him
a
letter
just
delivered
by
the
postman
it
was
from
olle
montanus
and
very
long
parts
of
it
seemed
to
impress
falk
greatly
my
dear
fellow
it
ran
although
lundell
and
i
have
now
finished
our
work
and
will
soon
be
back
in
stockholm
i
yet
feel
the
need
of
writing
down
my
impressions
because
they
have
been
of
great
importance
to
myself
and
my
spiritual
development
i
have
come
to
a
conclusion
and
i
am
as
full
of
amazement
as
a
chicken
which
has
just
been
hatched
and
stares
at
the
world
with
its
newly
opened
eyes
trampling
on
the
which
had
shut
out
the
light
for
so
long
the
conclusion
of
course
is
not
a
new
one
plato
propounded
it
before
christianity
was
the
world
the
visible
world
is
but
a
delusion
the
reflexion
of
the
ideas
that
is
to
say
reality
is
something
low
insignificant
secondary
and
accidental
yes
but
i
will
proceed
synthetically
begin
with
the
particular
and
pass
on
from
it
to
the
general
i
will
speak
of
my
work
first
in
which
both
government
and
parliament
have
been
interested
on
the
altar
of
the
church
at
träskola
two
wooden
figures
used
to
stand
one
of
them
was
broken
but
the
other
one
was
whole
the
whole
one
the
figure
of
a
woman
held
a
cross
in
her
hand
two
sacks
of
fragments
of
the
broken
one
were
preserved
in
the
sacristy
a
learned
archæologist
had
examined
the
contents
of
the
two
sacks
in
order
to
determine
the
appearance
of
the
broken
figure
but
the
result
had
been
mere
conjecture
but
he
had
been
very
thorough
he
had
taken
a
specimen
of
the
white
paint
with
which
the
figure
had
been
grounded
and
sent
it
to
the
pharmaceutical
institute
the
latter
had
reported
that
it
contained
lead
and
not
zinc
therefore
the
figure
must
date
from
before
because
did
not
come
into
use
until
after
that
date
what
can
one
say
to
such
a
conclusion
seeing
that
the
figure
might
have
been
painted
over
next
he
sent
a
sample
of
the
wood
to
the
stockholm
timber
office
he
was
informed
that
it
was
birch
the
figure
was
therefore
made
of
birchwood
and
dated
from
before
but
that
was
not
all
he
was
striving
for
he
had
a
reason
in
plain
words
he
wished
for
his
own
aggrandisement
that
the
carved
figures
should
be
proved
to
date
from
the
sixteenth
century
and
he
would
have
preferred
that
they
should
be
the
work
of
the
great
of
course
because
his
name
had
been
so
deeply
carved
in
oak
that
it
has
been
preserved
to
our
time
burchard
von
schiedenhanne
who
had
carved
the
seats
in
the
choir
of
the
cathedral
of
västeros
the
learned
research
was
carried
on
the
professor
stole
a
little
plaster
from
the
figures
in
västeros
and
sent
it
together
with
a
specimen
from
the
sacristy
of
träskola
to
the
ekole
pollytechnik
i
ca
spell
it
the
reply
completely
crushed
the
scoffers
the
analysis
proved
that
the
two
specimens
of
plaster
were
identical
both
contained
per
cent
of
chalk
and
of
sulphuric
acid
therefore
the
figures
must
date
from
the
same
period
the
age
of
the
figures
had
now
been
settled
a
sketch
was
made
of
the
whole
one
and
sent
in
what
a
terrible
passion
these
learned
men
have
for
sending
things
in
to
the
academy
the
only
thing
which
remained
to
be
done
was
to
determine
and
reconstruct
the
broken
one
for
two
whole
years
the
two
sacks
travelled
up
and
down
between
upsala
and
lund
the
two
professors
differed
and
carried
on
a
lively
dispute
the
professor
of
lund
who
had
just
been
made
rector
took
the
figure
as
the
subject
of
his
inaugural
address
and
crushed
the
professor
of
upsala
the
latter
replied
in
a
brochure
fortunately
at
the
very
moment
a
professor
of
the
stockholm
academy
of
art
appeared
with
a
totally
new
opinion
then
herod
and
pilate
compromised
as
is
always
the
case
and
attacked
the
man
from
the
capital
rending
him
with
the
unbridled
fury
of
provincials
this
was
their
compromise
the
broken
figure
had
represented
unbelief
because
the
other
one
must
have
been
meant
for
faith
whose
symbol
is
the
cross
the
supposition
advanced
by
the
professor
of
lund
that
the
broken
figure
had
been
intended
to
represent
hope
arrived
at
because
one
of
the
sacks
contained
an
anchor
was
rejected
because
that
would
have
postulated
a
third
figure
love
of
which
there
was
no
trace
and
for
which
there
could
have
been
no
room
moreover
it
was
proved
by
specimens
from
the
rich
collection
of
in
the
historical
museum
that
the
fragment
in
question
was
not
an
anchor
but
an
arrowhead
which
forms
a
part
of
the
weapons
belonging
to
the
symbols
of
unbelief
the
shape
of
the
arrowhead
which
resembled
in
every
detail
those
from
the
period
of
the
sture
removed
the
last
doubt
as
to
the
age
of
the
figure
it
was
my
task
to
make
a
statue
of
unbelief
as
a
companion
to
the
figure
of
faith
in
accordance
with
the
directions
of
the
professors
i
was
given
my
instructions
and
i
did
not
hesitate
i
looked
for
a
male
model
for
the
figure
was
to
be
a
man
i
had
to
look
for
a
long
time
but
i
found
him
in
the
end
i
really
believe
i
met
the
personification
of
unbelief
and
i
succeeded
brilliantly
and
there
he
now
stands
falander
the
actor
to
the
left
of
the
altar
with
a
mexican
bow
used
in
the
drama
and
a
cloak
from
but
the
people
say
that
it
is
unbelief
throwing
down
his
arms
before
faith
and
the
who
preached
the
inaugural
sermon
spoke
of
the
splendid
gifts
which
god
sometimes
gives
to
man
and
which
in
this
case
he
had
given
to
me
and
the
count
who
gave
the
inaugural
dinner
declared
that
i
had
created
a
masterpiece
fit
to
stand
side
by
side
with
the
antiques
he
been
in
italy
and
a
student
who
occupies
some
post
in
the
count
household
seized
the
opportunity
to
write
and
circulate
some
verses
in
which
he
developed
the
conception
of
the
sublimely
beautiful
and
gave
a
history
of
the
myth
of
the
devil
up
to
now
i
have
like
a
true
egoist
spoken
only
of
myself
what
am
i
to
say
about
lundell
i
will
try
to
describe
it
to
you
christ
rehnhjelm
hangs
on
the
cross
in
the
background
to
the
left
is
the
impenitent
thief
i
and
the
rascal
has
made
me
than
i
am
to
the
right
the
repenting
thief
lundell
himself
squinting
with
hypocritical
eyes
at
rehnhjelm
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
mary
magdalene
you
will
remember
marie
in
a
very
low
dress
and
a
roman
centurion
falander
on
horseback
stallion
belonging
to
alderman
olsson
i
can
not
describe
the
awful
impression
made
on
me
when
after
the
sermon
the
picture
was
unveiled
and
i
saw
all
these
faces
staring
from
the
wall
above
the
altar
at
the
community
rapturously
listening
to
the
words
of
the
preacher
on
the
great
importance
of
art
particularly
art
in
the
service
of
religion
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
a
veil
has
been
lifted
from
many
things
i
will
tell
you
by
and
by
my
thoughts
on
faith
and
unbelief
i
am
going
to
embody
my
views
on
art
and
its
high
mission
in
an
essay
and
read
it
at
some
public
hall
as
soon
as
i
am
back
in
town
it
goes
without
saying
that
lundell
religious
sense
has
tremendously
developed
during
those
dear
days
he
is
comparatively
speaking
happy
in
his
colossal
and
has
no
idea
what
a
rascal
he
really
is
i
think
i
have
told
you
everything
now
anything
else
verbally
when
we
meet
until
then
i
hope
you
are
in
good
health
and
spirits
your
friend
olle
montanus
i
must
not
forget
to
tell
you
the
result
of
the
antiquarian
research
the
end
of
it
all
was
that
old
jan
an
inmate
of
the
almshouses
remembered
having
seen
the
figures
when
he
was
a
child
he
said
there
had
been
three
faith
hope
and
love
and
as
love
was
the
greatest
of
these
it
had
stood
above
the
altar
in
the
first
decade
of
this
century
a
flash
of
lightning
had
struck
love
and
faith
the
figures
had
been
the
work
of
his
father
who
was
a
carver
of
in
the
naval
port
karlskrona
when
falk
had
read
the
letters
he
sat
down
at
his
examined
his
lamp
to
see
whether
there
was
plenty
of
oil
in
it
lit
his
pipe
took
a
manuscript
from
his
and
began
to
write
chapter
xix
from
churchyard
to
the
september
afternoon
lay
grey
and
warm
and
still
over
the
capital
as
falk
climbed
the
hills
in
the
south
when
he
had
arrived
at
the
churchyard
of
catherine
he
sat
down
to
rest
he
noticed
with
a
feeling
of
genuine
pleasure
that
the
maples
had
turned
colour
during
the
recent
cold
nights
and
he
welcomed
autumn
with
its
darkness
its
grey
clouds
and
falling
leaves
not
a
breath
stirred
it
was
as
if
nature
were
resting
tired
after
the
work
of
the
short
summer
everything
was
asleep
the
dead
were
lying
beneath
the
sod
calm
and
peaceful
as
if
they
had
never
been
alive
he
wished
that
he
had
all
men
there
and
that
he
himself
was
with
them
the
clock
on
the
tower
chimed
the
hour
and
he
rose
and
continued
his
walk
he
went
down
garden
street
turned
into
new
street
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
new
a
hundred
years
ago
at
least
crossed
the
new
market
and
came
to
the
white
mountains
he
stood
still
before
the
spotted
house
listening
to
the
chatter
for
as
usual
there
were
children
playing
about
the
street
they
talked
loudly
and
unreservedly
while
they
were
busy
polishing
little
pieces
of
brick
presently
to
be
used
in
a
game
of
what
did
you
have
for
dinner
janne
that
my
business
your
business
did
you
say
it
was
your
business
mind
what
about
or
you
get
a
hiding
do
brag
you
with
your
eyes
who
shoved
you
into
the
lake
the
other
day
oh
shut
up
janne
received
a
thrashing
and
peace
was
restored
i
say
you
stole
cress
in
the
churchyard
the
other
day
did
you
janne
that
cripple
olee
split
on
me
and
you
were
nabbed
by
the
police
were
you
who
cares
for
the
police
i
do

come
along
of
us
then
we
going
to
pinch
some
pears
there
a
savage
dog
behind
the
fence
garn
peter
climb
over
and
a
kick
do
for
the
dog
the
polishing
was
interrupted
by
a
who
came
out
of
the
house
and
began
to
scatter
pine
branches
on
the
street
who
going
to
be
buried
the
deputy
wife
baby
he
a
proper
old
satan
the
deputy
is
he
instead
of
replying
the
other
began
whistling
an
unknown
and
very
peculiar
tune
let
thrash
his
cubs
when
they
come
home
from
school
i
say
does
his
old
woman
fancy
herself
the
old
locked
us
out
in
the
snow
the
other
night
because
we
could
pay
the
rent
and
we
had
to
spend
the
night
in
the
barn
the
conversation
flickered
out
the
last
item
of
conversation
had
not
made
the
smallest
impression
on
janne
friend
after
this
introduction
to
the
status
of
the
tenants
by
the
two
urchins
falk
entered
the
house
not
with
the
pleasantest
of
sensations
he
was
received
at
the
door
by
struve
who
looked
distressed
and
took
falk
arm
as
if
he
were
going
to
confide
a
secret
to
him
or
suppress
a
tear
he
had
to
do
something
so
he
embraced
him
falk
found
himself
in
a
big
room
with
a
a
sideboard
six
chairs
and
a
coffin
white
sheets
were
hanging
before
the
windows
through
which
the
daylight
filtered
and
broke
at
the
red
glow
of
the
tallow
candles
on
the
table
stood
a
tray
with
green
wine
glasses
and
a
soup
tureen
filled
with
dahlias
stocks
and
white
asters
struve
seized
falk
hand
and
led
him
to
the
coffin
where
the
baby
lay
bedded
on
shavings
covered
with
tulle
and
strewn
with
fuchsias
there
he
said
there
falk
felt
nothing
but
the
quite
commonplace
emotion
the
living
always
feel
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
he
could
think
of
nothing
suitable
to
say
and
therefore
he
confined
himself
to
pressing
the
father
hand
thank
you
thank
you
stammered
struve
and
disappeared
in
an
adjoining
room
falk
was
left
alone
he
could
hear
excited
whispering
behind
the
door
through
which
struve
had
vanished
then
it
grew
still
for
a
while
but
presently
a
murmur
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
penetrated
the
matchboard
wall
a
strident
treble
seemed
to
be
reciting
long
verses
with
incredible
volubility
babebibobubybäbö
babebibobubybäbö
babebibobubybäbö
it
sounded
an
angry
man
voice
answered
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
plane
which
said
hwitcho
hwitcho
hwitch
hwitch
hitch
hitch
and
a
rumbling
replied
seemingly
anxious
to
calm
the
storm
but
the
plane
spat
and
sneezed
again
its
hwitch
hwitch
and
immediately
after
a
storm
of
babili
bebili
bibili
bobili
bubili
bybili
bäbili
bö
broke
out
with
fresh
fury
falk
guessed
the
subject
under
discussion
and
a
certain
intonation
gave
him
the
idea
that
the
dead
baby
was
involved
in
the
argument
the
whispering
occasionally
interrupted
by
loud
sobs
began
again
behind
the
door
through
which
struve
had
disappeared
finally
it
was
pushed
open
and
struve
appeared
leading
by
the
hand
a
woman
who
looked
like
a
laundress
she
was
dressed
in
black
and
her
eyelids
were
red
and
swollen
with
weeping
struve
introduced
her
with
all
the
dignity
of
a
father
of
a
family
my
wife
falk
my
old
friend
falk
clasped
a
hand
hard
as
a
beetle
and
received
a
vinegary
smile
he
cast
about
for
a
few
platitudes
containing
the
words
wife
and
grief
and
as
he
was
fairly
successful
he
was
rewarded
by
struve
with
an
embrace
struve
anxious
not
to
be
left
out
in
the
cold
began
brushing
the
back
of
her
husband
coat
it
dreadful
how
you
seem
to
pick
up
every
bit
of
dirt
christian
she
said
your
back
always
dusty
do
you
think
that
my
husband
always
looks
like
a
pig
mr
falk
there
was
no
need
for
poor
falk
to
reply
to
this
tender
remark
behind
the
mother
back
now
appeared
two
heads
regarding
the
visitor
with
a
grin
the
mother
patted
them
affectionately
have
you
ever
seen
plainer
boys
before
mr
falk
she
asked
they
look
exactly
like
young
foxes
this
statement
was
so
undeniably
accurate
that
falk
felt
compelled
to
deny
it
eagerly
the
opening
of
the
hall
door
and
the
entrance
of
two
men
stopped
all
further
civilities
the
first
of
the
was
a
man
of
thirty
with
a
square
head
the
front
of
which
was
supposed
to
represent
the
face
the
skin
looked
like
the
plank
of
a
bridge
in
which
worms
have
ploughed
their
labyrinths
the
wide
mouth
always
slightly
open
showed
the
four
shining
whenever
he
smiled
his
face
seemed
to
split
into
two
parts
his
mouth
opened
as
far
back
as
the
fourth
back
tooth
not
a
single
hair
grew
in
the
barren
soil
the
nose
was
so
badly
put
on
that
one
could
see
through
it
far
into
the
head
on
the
upper
part
of
the
skull
grew
something
which
looked
like
matting
struve
who
possessed
the
faculty
of
ennobling
his
environment
introduced
candidate
borg
as
borg
the
latter
without
a
sign
of
either
pleasure
or
annoyance
held
out
his
arm
to
his
companion
who
pulled
off
the
coat
and
hung
it
on
the
hinge
of
the
front
door
an
act
which
drew
from
struve
the
remark
that
the
old
house
was
in
such
bad
repair
that
there
was
not
even
a
the
man
who
had
helped
borg
off
with
his
overcoat
was
introduced
as
levi
he
was
a
tall
overgrown
youth
the
skull
seemed
but
a
backward
development
of
the
nasal
bone
and
the
trunk
which
reached
to
the
knees
looked
as
if
it
had
been
drawn
through
a
wire
plate
in
the
way
in
which
wire
is
drawn
the
shoulders
slanted
like
eaves
there
was
no
trace
of
hips
the
shanks
ran
up
into
the
thighs
the
feet
were
worn
out
of
shape
like
a
pair
of
old
shoes
the
instep
had
given
way
the
legs
curved
outward
and
downward
like
the
legs
of
a
working
man
who
has
carried
heavy
loads
or
stood
for
the
greater
part
of
his
life
he
was
a
pure
the
candidate
had
remained
at
the
door
he
had
taken
off
his
gloves
put
down
his
stick
blown
his
nose
and
put
back
the
handkerchief
into
his
pocket
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
struve
repeated
attempts
to
introduce
him
he
believed
that
he
was
still
in
the
entrance
hall
but
now
he
took
his
hat
scraped
the
floor
with
his
foot
and
made
a
step
into
the
room
good
morning
jenny
how
are
you
he
said
seizing
struve
hand
with
as
much
eagerness
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
life
and
death
he
bowed
hardly
perceptibly
to
falk
with
the
snarl
of
a
dog
who
sees
a
strange
dog
in
its
yard
young
levi
followed
at
the
heels
of
the
candidate
responding
to
his
smiles
applauding
his
sarcasms
and
generally
to
his
superiority
struve
opened
a
bottle
of
hock
and
filled
the
glasses
struve
raised
his
glass
and
welcomed
his
guests
the
candidate
opened
his
mouth
made
a
canal
of
his
tongue
poured
the
contents
of
the
glass
on
it
grinned
as
if
it
were
physic
and
swallowed
it
it
awfully
sour
and
nasty
said
struve
would
you
prefer
a
glass
of
punch
henrik
yes
it
very
nasty
agreed
the
candidate
and
levi
eagerly
seconded
him
the
punch
was
brought
in
borg
face
brightened
he
looked
for
a
chair
and
immediately
levi
brought
him
one
the
party
sat
down
round
the
the
strong
scent
of
the
stocks
mingled
with
the
smell
of
the
wine
the
candles
were
reflected
in
the
glasses
the
conversation
became
lively
and
soon
a
column
of
smoke
stood
above
the
candidate
chair
struve
glanced
uneasily
at
the
little
sleeper
near
the
window
but
nobody
saw
her
look
presently
a
coach
stopped
in
the
street
outside
the
house
everybody
rose
except
the
candidate
struve
coughed
and
in
a
low
voice
as
if
he
had
something
unpleasant
to
say
he
whispered
shall
we
get
ready
now
struve
went
to
the
coffin
and
stooped
over
it
weeping
bitterly
when
in
drawing
back
she
saw
her
husband
standing
behind
her
with
the
coffin
lid
she
burst
into
loud
sobs
there
there
compose
yourself
said
struve
hastening
to
screw
down
the
lid
as
if
he
wanted
to
hide
something
borg
looking
like
a
yawning
horse
gulped
down
another
glass
of
punch
levi
helped
struve
to
screw
down
the
lid
displaying
quite
extraordinary
skill
he
seemed
to
be
packing
a
bale
of
goods
the
men
shook
hands
with
struve
put
on
their
overcoats
and
went
the
woman
warned
them
to
be
careful
in
going
downstairs
the
stairs
were
old
and
rotten
struve
marched
in
front
carrying
the
coffin
when
he
stepped
into
the
street
and
became
aware
of
the
little
crowd
which
had
collected
before
the
house
he
felt
flattered
and
the
devil
of
pride
took
possession
of
him
he
scolded
the
driver
who
had
omitted
to
open
the
door
and
let
down
the
steps
to
heighten
the
effect
of
his
words
he
spoke
with
contemptuous
familiarity
to
the
tall
man
in
livery
who
hat
in
hand
hastened
to
carry
out
his
commands
from
the
centre
of
the
crowd
where
the
boy
janne
was
standing
came
a
short
scornful
cough
but
when
the
boy
saw
that
he
was
attracting
universal
attention
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
chimneys
and
seemed
to
be
eagerly
looking
for
the
sweep
the
door
of
the
coach
slammed
behind
the
four
men
a
lively
conversation
broke
out
between
some
of
the
younger
members
of
the
who
now
felt
more
at
their
ease
i
say
what
a
swell
coffin
did
you
see
it
yes
but
did
you
see
that
there
was
no
name
on
it
was
there
no
did
you
see
it
it
was
quite
plain
why
was
that
then
do
you
know
because
he
was
a
bastard
the
whip
cracked
and
the
coach
rumbled
off
falk
eyes
strayed
to
the
window
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
struve
who
had
already
removed
some
of
the
sheets
blowing
out
the
candles
and
he
saw
the
two
cubs
standing
by
the
side
of
her
each
with
a
glass
of
wine
in
his
hand
the
coach
rattled
along
through
street
after
street
nobody
attempted
to
speak
struve
sitting
with
the
coffin
on
his
knees
looked
embarrassed
it
was
still
daylight
he
longed
to
make
himself
invisible
it
was
a
long
journey
to
the
churchyard
but
it
finally
came
to
an
end
they
arrived
a
row
of
coaches
stood
before
the
gate
they
bought
wreaths
and
the
gravedigger
took
possession
of
the
coffin
after
a
lengthy
walk
the
small
procession
stopped
quite
at
the
back
on
the
north
side
of
the
churchyard
close
to
a
new
sandfield
the
gravedigger
placed
the
coffin
in
position
borg
commanded
hold
tight
ease
off
let
go
and
the
little
nameless
child
was
lowered
three
yards
into
the
ground
there
was
a
pause
all
heads
were
bowed
and
all
eyes
looking
into
the
grave
as
if
they
were
waiting
for
something
a
leaden
sky
gloomed
dismally
over
the
large
deserted
sandfield
the
white
poles
of
which
looked
like
the
shadows
of
little
children
who
had
lost
their
way
the
dark
wood
might
have
been
the
background
in
a
magic
lantern
show
the
wind
was
hushed
all
of
a
sudden
a
voice
rose
tremulous
at
first
but
growing
in
clearness
and
intensity
as
if
it
were
speaking
from
an
inner
conviction
levi
was
standing
on
the
pall
in
the
safe
keeping
of
the
most
high
resting
in
the
shadow
of
his
omnipotence
i
say
to
the
eternal
oh
thou
my
stronghold
my
defence
in
all
eternity
my
god
in
whom
i
trust
kaddisch
lord
almighty
god
let
thy
holy
name
be
worshipped
and
sanctified
in
the
whole
world
thou
wilt
in
thy
own
time
renew
the
world
thou
wilt
awaken
the
dead
and
call
them
to
a
new
life
everlasting
peace
reigns
in
thy
kingdom
give
us
and
all
israel
thy
peace
amen
sleep
soundly
little
one
to
whom
no
name
had
been
given
he
who
knoweth
his
own
will
give
you
a
name
sleep
soundly
in
the
autumn
night
no
evil
spirits
will
trouble
you
although
you
never
received
the
holy
water
rejoice
that
you
are
spared
the
battle
of
life
you
can
dispense
with
its
pleasures
count
yourself
happy
that
you
were
permitted
to
go
before
you
knew
the
world
pure
and
stainless
your
soul
left
its
delicate
tenement
therefore
we
will
not
throw
earth
on
your
coffin
for
earth
is
an
emblem
of
dissolution
we
will
bed
you
in
flowers
for
as
a
flower
pierces
the
soil
so
your
soul
shall
rise
from
the
dark
grave
to
the
light
from
spirit
you
came
to
spirit
you
will
return
he
dropped
his
wreath
into
the
little
grave
and
covered
his
head
struve
took
a
few
steps
towards
him
seized
his
hand
and
shook
it
warmly
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
and
he
begged
levi
for
the
loan
of
his
handkerchief
borg
after
throwing
his
wreath
into
the
grave
turned
to
go
and
the
others
followed
slowly
falk
stood
gazing
into
the
open
grave
plunged
in
deep
thought
at
first
he
saw
only
a
square
of
darkness
but
gradually
a
bright
spot
appeared
which
grew
and
took
shape
it
looked
like
a
disc
and
shone
with
the
whiteness
of
a
mirror
it
was
the
blank
shield
on
which
the
life
of
the
child
should
have
been
recorded
it
gleamed
brightly
in
the
darkness
reflecting
the
unbroken
daylight
he
dropped
his
wreath
there
was
a
faint
dull
thud
and
the
light
went
out
he
turned
and
followed
the
others
arrived
at
the
coach
there
was
a
brief
discussion
borg
cut
it
short
to
the
restaurant
norrbacka
he
said
briefly
a
few
minutes
later
the
party
was
standing
in
the
large
room
on
the
first
floor
they
were
received
by
a
girl
whom
borg
embraced
and
kissed
this
done
he
pushed
his
hat
underneath
the
sofa
commanded
levi
to
help
him
off
with
his
overcoat
and
ordered
a
quart
of
punch
cigars
half
a
pint
of
brandy
and
a
finally
he
took
off
his
coat
and
sat
down
in
shirt
sleeves
on
the
only
sofa
in
the
room
struve
face
beamed
when
he
saw
the
preparations
for
an
orgy
and
he
shouted
for
music
levi
went
to
the
piano
and
strummed
a
waltz
while
struve
put
his
arm
into
falk
and
walked
with
him
up
and
down
the
room
he
touched
lightly
on
life
in
general
on
grief
and
joy
the
inconstant
nature
of
man
and
so
on
all
of
which
went
to
prove
that
it
was
a
sin
to
mourn
what
the
gods
he
said
gods
because
he
had
already
said
sin
and
did
not
wish
to
be
taken
for
a
pietist
had
given
and
taken
this
reflexion
was
apparently
made
by
way
of
an
introduction
to
the
waltz
which
he
immediately
after
danced
with
the
girl
who
brought
the
bowl
borg
filled
the
glasses
called
levi
nodded
towards
a
glass
and
said
let
drink
to
our
brotherly
love
now
later
on
we
can
be
as
rude
as
we
like
levi
expressed
his
appreciation
of
the
honour
your
health
isaac
said
borg
my
name
not
isaac
what
the
dickens
do
i
care
what
your
name
is
i
call
you
isaac
my
isaac
you
a
jolly
devil
devil
shame
on
you
jew
we
were
going
to
be
as
rude
as
we
liked
we
i
was
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
struve
thought
he
had
better
interfere
thank
you
brother
levi
for
your
beautiful
words
he
said
what
prayer
was
that
our
funeral
prayer
it
was
beautiful
nothing
but
empty
words
interposed
borg
the
infidel
dog
prayed
only
for
israel
therefore
the
prayer
could
have
been
meant
for
the
child
all
those
who
are
not
baptized
are
looked
upon
as
belonging
to
israel
replied
levi
and
then
you
attacked
baptism
continued
borg
i
do
allow
anybody
to
attack
baptism
we
can
do
that
ourselves
and
furthermore
you
attacked
the
doctrine
of
justification
by
faith
leave
it
alone
in
future
i
do
permit
any
outsiders
to
attack
our
religion
borg
right
there
said
struve
we
should
draw
the
line
at
attacking
either
baptism
or
any
other
of
the
sacred
truths
and
i
must
beg
of
you
not
to
indulge
in
any
frivolous
discussion
of
these
things
you
must
beg
of
us
sneered
borg
must
you
really
all
right
forgive
you
if
you
hold
your
tongue
play
something
isaac
music
why
is
music
mute
at
cæsar
feast
music
but
none
of
your
old
chestnuts
play
something
new
levi
went
to
the
piano
and
played
the
overture
to
the
mute
now
let
talk
said
borg
you
are
looking
depressed
falk
have
a
glass
with
me
falk
who
felt
a
certain
embarrassment
in
borg
company
accepted
the
offer
with
mental
reservations
but
conversation
languished
everybody
seemed
to
dread
a
collision
struve
fluttered
about
like
a
moth
in
search
of
pleasure
but
unable
to
find
it
he
again
and
again
returned
to
the
every
now
and
then
he
danced
a
few
steps
to
keep
up
the
fiction
that
the
meeting
was
merry
and
festive
but
this
was
not
the
case
by
any
means
levi
between
piano
and
punch
he
attempted
to
sing
a
cheerful
song
but
it
was
so
stale
that
nobody
would
listen
to
it
borg
talked
at
the
top
of
his
voice
in
order
to
raise
his
spirits
as
he
said
but
the
party
grew
more
and
more
silent
one
might
almost
have
said
uneasy
falk
paced
up
and
down
the
room
taciturn
portentous
like
a
thundercloud
at
borg
order
a
tremendous
supper
a
sexa
was
served
the
convives
took
their
seats
amidst
ominous
silence
struve
and
borg
drank
immoderate
quantities
of
brandy
in
the
face
of
the
latter
red
spots
appeared
here
and
there
and
the
white
of
the
eyes
looked
yellow
but
struve
resembled
a
varnished
edam
cheese
he
was
uniformly
red
and
greasy
beside
them
falk
and
levi
looked
like
children
eating
their
last
supper
in
the
society
of
giants
borg
looked
at
levi
hand
the
salmon
to
the
he
commanded
in
order
to
break
the
monotonous
silence
levi
handed
the
dish
to
struve
the
latter
pushed
his
spectacles
on
to
his
forehead
and
spat
venom
shame
on
you
jew
he
foamed
throwing
his
in
face
borg
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
struve
bald
pate
silence
you
blackguard
he
said
what
dreadful
company
to
be
mixed
up
with
let
me
tell
you
gentlemen
i
too
old
to
be
treated
like
a
schoolboy
said
struve
tremulously
forgetting
his
usual
borg
who
had
had
enough
to
eat
rose
from
the
table
ugh
he
said
what
a
beastly
crowd
you
are
pay
isaac
i
pay
you
back
later
on
i
going
he
put
on
his
overcoat
put
his
hat
on
his
head
filled
a
tumbler
with
punch
added
brandy
to
it
emptied
it
at
one
gulp
blew
out
some
of
the
candles
in
passing
smashed
a
few
of
the
glasses
pocketed
a
handful
of
cigars
and
a
box
of
matches
and
staggered
out
of
the
room
what
a
pity
that
such
a
genius
should
drink
like
that
said
levi
solemnly
a
moment
later
borg
the
room
went
to
the
took
the
candelabrum
lighted
his
cigar
blew
the
smoke
into
struve
face
put
out
his
tongue
showed
his
back
teeth
extinguished
the
lights
and
departed
again
levi
rolled
on
the
floor
screaming
with
laughter
to
what
scum
have
you
introduced
me
asked
falk
gravely
oh
my
dear
fellow
he
intoxicated
but
he
the
son
of
professor
dr
i
did
ask
who
his
father
was
i
asked
who
he
was
said
falk
cutting
him
short
i
understand
now
why
you
allow
such
a
dog
to
bully
you
but
can
you
tell
me
why
he
associates
with
you
i
reserve
my
reply
to
all
these
futilities
answered
struve
stiffly
do
reserve
it
but
reserve
it
for
yourself
what
the
matter
with
you
brother
levi
asked
struve
officiously
you
look
so
grave
it
a
great
pity
that
a
genius
like
borg
should
drink
so
much
replied
levi
how
and
when
does
he
show
his
genius
asked
falk
a
man
can
be
a
genius
without
writing
verse
said
struve
pointedly
i
dare
say
writing
verse
does
not
genius
nor
is
a
man
a
genius
if
he
behaves
like
a
brute
said
falk
had
we
better
pay
and
go

stepped

and
the

was
black
only
the

of
the

the
sky
the
coach

driven
away
there
was
nothing
left
for

but
to
turn
up
their
collars

they
had
gone
as
far
as

when
they
were
startled
by
terrible
yells
above
their
heads

and
looking
up
they
saw

rocking
himself
on
one
of
the
highest
branches
of
a
lime
tree
the
branch
nearly
touched
the

at

on
the
altar
the
clock
in
the
vaults
of
thundered
the
seventh
hour
of
an
october
evening
as
the
manager
of
the
municipal
theatre
came
in
he
beamed
as
a
toad
may
beam
after
a
good
meal
he
looked
happy
but
his
facial
muscles
not
accustomed
to
express
such
emotions
drew
the
skin
into
worried
folds
and
disfigured
him
still
more
than
usual
he
nodded
patronizingly
to
the
little
shrivelled
who
was
standing
behind
the
bar
counting
the
guests
well
and
how
the
world
treating
you
screamed
the
manager
in
german
he
had
dropped
the
habit
of
speaking
long
ago
thank
you
replied
the
in
the
same
language
and
as
this
was
all
the
german
the
two
gentlemen
knew
the
conversation
was
continued
in
swedish
well
what
do
you
think
of
the
lad
gustav
was
his
don
diego
excellent
do
you
admit
that
i
can
make
actors
what
there
no
denying
that
fancy
that
boy
it
quite
true
what
you
said
sir
it
easier
to
do
something
with
a
man
who
has
been
ruined
by
books
are
the
ruin
of
a
good
many
people
nobody
knows
that
better
than
i
do
however
do
you
know
anything
about
books
i
do
you
will
see
queer
things
when
young
rehnhjelm
plays
horatio
i
promised
him
the
part
because
he
gave
me
no
peace
but
i
also
warned
him
not
to
look
to
me
for
any
assistance
i
do
want
to
be
held
responsible
for
his
failure
i
also
told
him
that
i
was
allowing
him
to
play
the
part
to
show
him
how
difficult
it
is
to
act
when
one
has
no
talent
oh
he
shall
have
such
a
snub
that
he
never
look
at
a
part
again
see
if
he
wo
but
that
is
what
i
want
to
say
to
you
have
you
got
two
vacant
rooms
the
two
small
ones
just
so
they
at
your
disposal
sir
supper
for
two
the
best
you
can
do
you
better
do
the
waiting
yourself
he
did
not
shout
the
last
few
words
the
bowed
he
had
understood
at
this
moment
falander
entered
the
room
he
took
his
accustomed
seat
without
as
much
as
a
look
at
the
manager
the
latter
rose
immediately
at
eight
then
he
whispered
as
he
passed
the
bar
and
went
out
the
brought
falander
a
bottle
of
absinth
and
all
the
usual
trimmings
as
the
actor
seemed
disinclined
to
enter
into
conversation
the
wiped
the
table
with
his
napkin
when
that
was
no
good
he
refilled
the
and
said
supper
the
small
rooms
hm
of
whom
and
of
what
are
you
talking
of
him
who
just
gone
out
i
see
but
that
unusual
he
generally
so
mean
supper
for
one
for
two
replied
the
winking
in
the
small
rooms
hm
falander
pricked
up
his
ears
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
ashamed
to
be
listening
to
gossip
and
dropped
the
subject
but
that
was
not
what
the
wanted
i
wonder
who
it
is
his
wife
is
ill
and
what
does
it
matter
to
us
let
the
monster
sup
with
whom
he
likes
have
you
an
evening
paper
the
was
saved
a
reply
rehnhjelm
was
approaching
the
table
radiant
like
a
man
who
sees
a
ray
of
light
on
his
path
leave
the
absinth
alone
he
said
and
be
my
guest
i
am
happy
i
could
cry
what
has
happened
asked
falander
uneasily
surely
he
has
given
you
a
part
he
has
you
pessimist
i
to
play
horatio
falander
face
clouded
and
she
play
ophelia
how
do
you
know
i
feel
it
you
and
your
premonitions
but
after
all
it
was
so
difficult
to
guess
do
you
think
she
deserves
it
have
they
a
better
ophelia
in
the
whole
company
no
i
admit
that
do
you
like
your
part
oh
it
splendid
it
extraordinary
how
opinions
differ
what
do
think
i
think
that
he
is
the
greatest
rascal
at
the
whole
court
he
says
yes
to
everything
my
prince
yes
my
good
prince
if
he
were
really
hamlet
friend
he
would
sometimes
say
no
and
not
always
agree
with
him
like
any
other
sycophant
are
you
going
to
overthrow
another
of
my
ideals
i
will
overthrow
all
your
false
idols
how
can
you
as
long
as
you
look
upon
all
paltry
creations
of
man
as
great
and
splendid
strive
after
the
eternal
if
you
see
perfection
and
excellence
in
everything
here
below
how
can
you
yearn
for
the
really
perfect
believe
me
pessimism
is
the
truest
idealism
it
is
a
christian
doctrine
too
if
that
will
salve
your
conscience
for
christianity
teaches
us
that
the
world
is
a
vale
of
tears
from
which
death
will
deliver
us
ca
you
let
me
believe
that
the
world
is
beautiful
ca
you
let
me
be
grateful
to
him
who
is
the
giver
of
all
good
things
and
rejoice
in
the
happiness
life
has
to
offer
yes
yes
my
boy
rejoice
rejoice
and
believe
and
hope
as
all
men
strive
for
the
same
thing
happiness
you
will
have
the
part
of
a
chance
of
winning
it
seeing
that
the
denominator
of
this
fraction
represents
the
number
of
people
on
this
earth
is
the
happiness
which
has
come
to
you
worth
the
torture
and
humiliations
of
the
last
few
months
and
moreover
what
is
this
great
piece
of
luck
you
have
been
given
a
part
to
play
a
part
in
which
you
can
not
make
a
success
by
which
i
do
mean
that
you
necessarily
need
be
a
failure
are
you
sure
that
he
paused
for
breath
that
agnes
will
have
a
success
in
the
part
of
ophelia
she
may
make
good
use
of
the
rare
chance
and
get
as
much
out
of
the
part
as
most
actresses
do
i
am
sorry
i
made
you
feel
sad
do
believe
what
i
said
after
all
who
knows
whether
i
am
right
or
wrong
if
i
did
know
you
better
i
might
believe
you
that
you
jealous
no
my
boy
nothing
would
please
me
more
than
to
see
yours
and
all
men
wishes
speedily
fulfilled
then
the
thoughts
of
men
might
turn
to
higher
things
perhaps
that
is
the
meaning
of
life
you
can
afford
to
say
that
so
calmly
you
have
had
success
long
ago
is
this
a
state
of
mind
much
to
be
desired
we
do
not
yearn
for
happiness
so
much
as
for
the
faculty
of
being
able
to
smile
at
our
ardent
efforts
i
say
advisedly
eight
strokes
thundered
through
the
room
falander
rose
hastily
as
if
he
were
going
to
leave
brushed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
sat
down
again
has
agnes
gone
to
see
aunt
beata
he
asked
casually
what
makes
you
think
so
i
merely
supposing
it
because
you
are
sitting
here
so
quietly
she
told
you
she
would
read
her
part
to
her
as
the
time
is
so
short
did
she
yes
have
you
seen
her
no
on
my
word
of
honour
i
have
only
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
which
would
prevent
her
from
spending
a
free
evening
with
you
you
guessed
correctly
she
urged
me
to
go
out
and
spend
the
evening
with
friends
she
thinks
i
too
much
at
home
the
dear
girl
she
has
such
a
tender
and
loving
little
heart
yes
very
tender
i
only
once
waited
for
her
in
vain
her
aunt
had
kept
her
till
late
and
forgotten
to
send
me
word
i
thought
i
was
going
mad
and
sleep
all
night
you
are
referring
to
the
evening
of
the
sixth
of
july
i
suppose
you
startle
me
are
you
watching
us
why
should
i
i
know
of
your
engagement
and
aid
you
in
every
way
i
can
and
why
should
i
know
that
it
was
tuesday
the
sixth
of
july
you
told
me
about
it
more
than
once
that
true
neither
of
them
spoke
for
a
while
it
extraordinary
said
rehnhjelm
suddenly
breaking
the
silence
that
happiness
can
make
one
feel
melancholy
i
feel
uneasy
and
would
much
rather
have
spent
the
evening
with
agnes
let
go
to
the
small
rooms
and
send
for
her
she
could
say
that
friends
had
arrived
from
the
country
she
would
do
that
she
could
tell
a
lie
oh
nonsense
the
woman
who
ca
is
born
yet
falander
stared
at
rehnhjelm
with
so
peculiar
an
expression
that
the
latter
felt
puzzled
i
go
and
see
whether
the
little
rooms
are
vacant
he
said
after
a
short
pause
we
can
send
her
a
message
if
they
are
come
along
then
rehnhjelm
made
ready
to
follow
him
but
falander
kept
him
back
i
be
back
in
two
minutes
he
returned
with
a
very
white
face
but
perfectly
calm
they
are
engaged
he
said
quietly
what
a
nuisance
let
keep
each
other
company
and
be
as
jolly
as
we
can
and
they
kept
each
other
company
ate
and
drank
and
talked
of
life
and
love
and
human
malice
and
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
talked
enough
they
went
home
and
to
bed
chapter
xxi
a
soul
overboard
rehnhjelm
awoke
on
the
following
morning
at
four
somebody
had
called
his
name
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
there
was
not
a
sound
he
drew
up
the
blind
and
looked
out
on
a
grey
autumn
morning
windy
and
rainy
he
went
back
to
bed
and
tried
to
sleep
but
in
vain
there
were
strange
voices
in
the
wind
they
moaned
and
warned
and
wept
and
whimpered
he
tried
to
think
of
something
pleasant
of
his
happiness
he
took
his
part
and
began
to
learn
it
it
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
he
thought
of
falander
words
and
could
not
help
admitting
that
he
was
to
some
extent
right
he
tried
to
picture
himself
on
the
stage
as
horatio
he
tried
to
picture
agnes
in
the
part
of
ophelia
and
could
see
in
her
nothing
but
a
hypocritical
schemer
spreading
nets
for
hamlet
at
polonius
advice
he
attempted
to
drive
away
the
thought
and
instead
of
agnes
he
saw
the
coquettish
miss
jacquette
who
had
been
the
last
to
play
the
part
at
the
municipal
theatre
he
tried
in
vain
to
drive
away
these
disagreeable
fancies
they
followed
him
like
gnats
at
last
exhausted
with
the
strain
he
fell
asleep
but
only
to
suffer
the
same
torment
in
his
dream
he
roused
himself
with
an
effort
but
soon
dropped
off
to
sleep
again
and
immediately
the
same
visions
disturbed
him
about
nine
he
awoke
with
a
scream
and
jumped
out
of
bed
as
if
he
were
fleeing
from
evil
spirits
when
he
looked
into
the
glass
he
saw
that
his
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
he
dressed
hastily
and
as
he
picked
up
his
boot
a
big
spider
ran
across
the
floor
the
sight
pleased
him
for
he
believed
in
the
superstition
that
a
spider
is
a
harbinger
of
happiness
his
was
restored
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
a
man
wanted
an
undisturbed
night
rest
he
should
avoid
crabs
for
supper
he
drank
his
coffee
and
smoked
a
pipe
and
smiled
at
the
and
the
wind
a
knock
at
the
door
aroused
him
from
his
reverie
he
started
for
he
was
afraid
of
news
he
could
not
tell
why
but
he
thought
of
the
spider
and
calmly
opened
the
door
a
servant
handed
him
a
letter
from
falander
begging
him
to
come
to
his
rooms
at
ten
on
very
important
business
again
he
was
assailed
by
the
indescribable
feeling
of
fear
which
had
troubled
his
morning
slumber
he
tried
to
while
away
the
time
until
ten
it
was
impossible
he
dressed
and
went
to
falander
house
the
latter
had
risen
early
his
room
had
been
put
straight
and
he
was
ready
to
receive
his
friend
he
greeted
rehnhjelm
cordially
but
with
unusual
gravity
rehnhjelm
overwhelmed
him
with
questions
but
falander
refused
to
reply
before
ten
rehnhjelm
anxiety
grew
and
he
wanted
to
know
whether
there
was
unpleasant
news
falander
replied
that
nothing
on
earth
was
unpleasant
as
long
as
one
looked
at
things
in
the
right
light
and
he
declared
that
many
unbearable
situations
could
be
borne
quite
easily
if
only
one
did
not
exaggerate
their
importance
the
time
passed
slowly
but
at
last
it
struck
ten
a
gentle
at
the
door
relieved
the
tension
falander
opened
at
once
and
admitted
agnes
without
a
look
at
those
present
she
drew
the
key
from
the
lock
and
locked
the
door
from
the
inside
a
momentary
embarrassment
seized
her
when
on
turning
round
she
was
confronted
by
two
men
instead
of
only
one
but
her
embarrassment
gave
way
to
pleasant
surprise
when
she
recognized
rehnhjelm
throwing
off
her
she
ran
towards
him
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
passionately
pressed
her
to
his
heart
as
if
he
had
not
seen
her
for
a
year
you
been
away
a
long
time
agnes
a
long
time
what
do
you
mean
i
feel
as
if
i
had
seen
you
for
a
how
splendid
you
are
looking
did
you
sleep
well
do
you
think
i
look
better
than
usual
yes
you
are
flushed
and
there
are
little
dimples
in
your
cheeks
wo
you
say
good
morning
to
falander
the
latter
stood
quietly
listening
to
the
conversation
but
his
face
was
deadly
white
and
he
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
thought
how
worn
you
are
looking
said
agnes
crossing
the
room
with
the
graceful
movements
of
a
kitten
as
rehnhjelm
released
her
from
his
arms
falander
made
no
reply
agnes
looked
at
him
more
keenly
and
all
at
once
became
aware
of
his
thoughts
a
fleeting
expression
of
trouble
passed
across
her
face
as
the
surface
of
a
pond
is
rippled
by
the
breeze
but
she
immediately
regained
her
usual
serenity
glanced
at
rehnhjelm
realized
the
situation
and
was
prepared
for
anything
may
we
be
told
what
important
business
has
brought
us
together
here
at
this
early
hour
she
asked
gaily
putting
her
hand
on
shoulder
certainly
said
the
latter
with
such
firm
resolution
that
her
face
paled
but
at
the
same
moment
he
threw
back
his
head
as
if
he
wanted
to
force
his
thoughts
into
another
groove
it
my
birthday
and
i
want
you
to
have
breakfast
with
me
agnes
who
had
seen
the
train
rushing
straight
at
her
felt
relieved
she
burst
into
merry
laughter
and
embraced
falander
but
as
breakfast
has
been
ordered
for
eleven
we
have
to
wait
a
while
wo
you
sit
down
there
was
an
ominous
silence
an
angel
is
passing
through
the
room
said
agnes
you
said
rehnhjelm
respectfully
and
ardently
kissing
her
hand
falander
looked
as
if
he
had
been
thrown
out
of
his
saddle
and
was
making
violent
efforts
to
regain
it
i
saw
a
spider
this
morning
said
rehnhjelm
that
predicts
happiness
matin
said
falander
have
you
never
heard
that
what
does
that
mean
asked
agnes
a
spider
on
the
morrow
grief
and
sorrow
hm
again
they
grew
silent
the
only
sound
which
disturbed
the
stillness
was
the
sound
of
the
rain
beating
in
gusts
against
the
windows
i
read
an
awfully
tragic
book
last
night
presently
remarked
falander
i
hardly
slept
a
wink
what
book
was
that
asked
rehnhjelm
without
betraying
very
much
interest
its
title
was
clément
and
its
subject
the
usual
game
but
it
was
told
so
well
that
it
made
a
great
impression
on
me
may
i
ask
what
the
usual
woman
game
is
said
agnes
faithlessness
and
treachery
and
this
pierre
clément
he
was
of
course
betrayed
he
was
a
young
artist
in
love
with
another
man
mistress
i
remember
the
book
i
liked
it
very
much
was
she
later
on
engaged
to
a
man
whom
she
really
loved
yes
that
was
it
and
during
all
the
time
she
kept
up
her
old
the
author
wanted
to
show
that
a
woman
can
love
in
two
ways
a
man
only
in
one
that
true
enough
is
it
certainly
but
the
day
came
when
her
fiancé
was
going
to
compete
with
a
picture
to
cut
my
tale
short
she
gave
herself
to
the
president
and
pierre
clément
was
happy
and
could
be
married
and
by
this
the
author
wanted
to
show
that
a
woman
will
sacrifice
everything
to
the
man
she
loves
a
man
on
the
other
hand
that
is
the
most
infamous
statement
i
ever
heard
burst
out
falander
he
rose
went
to
his
threw
open
the
flap
and
took
out
a
black
box
here
he
said
handing
it
to
agnes
go
home
and
rid
the
world
of
a
monster
what
that
laughed
agnes
opening
the
box
and
taking
out
a
revolver
i
say
what
a
sweet
thing
did
you
use
this
as
carl
moor
i
believe
it
is
loaded
she
raised
the
revolver
and
fired
up
the
chimney
lock
it
up
she
said
this
is
no
toy
my
friends
rehnhjelm
had
watched
the
scene
speechlessly
he
understood
the
meaning
well
enough
but
he
was
unable
to
say
a
word
and
he
was
so
much
under
the
girl
spell
that
he
could
not
even
feel
angry
with
her
he
realized
that
he
had
been
stabbed
but
he
had
as
yet
not
had
time
to
feel
the
pain
the
girl
impudence
disconcerted
falander
he
wanted
time
to
recover
his
moral
execution
had
been
a
complete
failure
and
his
de
had
been
disastrous
to
himself
had
we
better
go
now
asked
agnes
straightening
her
hat
before
the
glass
falander
opened
the
door
go
and
be
damned
to
you
he
said
you
have
ruined
an
honest
peace
of
mind
what
are
you
talking
about
shut
the
door
it
none
too
warm
here
i
see
i
have
to
speak
more
plainly
where
were
you
last
night
hjalmar
knows
and
it
no
business
of
yours
you
were
not
at
your
aunt
you
had
supper
with
the
manager
it
a
lie
i
saw
you
at
nine
in
the
vaults
of
the
i
say
it
a
lie
i
was
at
home
at
that
time
go
and
ask
aunt
maid
who
saw
me
home
i
should
never
have
expected
this
from
you
had
we
better
stop
talking
nonsense
now
and
be
off
you
read
stupid
books
all
night
then
you
would
be
in
a
bad
temper
on
the
next
day
put
on
your
hats
and
come
rehnhjelm
put
his
hand
to
his
head
to
feel
whether
it
was
in
its
accustomed
place
for
everything
seemed
to
him
to
be
turned
upside
down
when
he
found
that
it
was
still
there
he
attempted
to
come
to
a
clear
understanding
of
the
matter
but
he
was
unable
to
do
so
where
were
you
on
the
sixth
of
july
asked
falander
with
the
sternness
of
a
judge
what
an
idiotic
question
to
ask
how
can
i
remember
what
happened
three
months
ago
you
were
with
me
but
you
told
hjalmar
you
were
with
your
aunt
do
listen
to
him
said
agnes
going
up
to
rehnhjelm
and
caressing
him
he
talking
nonsense
rehnhjelm
hand
shot
out
he
seized
her
by
the
throat
and
flung
her
on
her
back
behind
the
stove
where
she
fell
on
a
little
pile
of
wood
and
remained
lying
still
and
motionless
he
put
on
his
hat
but
falander
had
to
help
him
with
his
coat
for
he
trembled
violently
come
along
let
be
off
he
said
spitting
on
the
hearthstone
falander
hesitated
for
a
moment
felt
agnes
pulse
and
then
followed
rehnhjelm
with
whom
he
caught
up
in
the
lower
hall
i
admire
you
he
said
the
matter
was
really
beyond
discussion
then
let
it
for
ever
remain
so
we
have
much
time
to
enjoy
each
other
company
i
am
leaving
for
home
by
the
next
train
to
work
and
to
forget
let
go
to
the
vaults
now
they
went
to
the
vaults
and
engaged
a
private
room
where
breakfast
was
served
to
them
has
my
hair
turned
grey
asked
rehnhjelm
passing
his
hand
over
his
hair
which
was
damp
and
clung
closely
to
his
skull
no
old
man
that
does
often
happen
even
i
not
grey
is
she
hurt
no
it
was
in
this
room
i
met
her
for
the
first
time
he
rose
from
the
table
staggered
to
the
sofa
and
threw
himself
on
his
knees
by
the
side
of
it
burying
his
head
in
the
cushions
he
burst
into
tears
like
a
child
crying
in
his
mother
lap
falander
took
his
head
in
both
his
hands
and
rehnhjelm
felt
something
hot
and
scalding
dropping
on
his
neck
where
your
philosophy
now
old
fellow
out
with
it
i
drowning
give
me
a
straw
to
clutch
at
poor
boy
poor
old
boy
i
must
see
her
i
must
ask
her
forgiveness
i
love
her
in
spite
of
it
in
spite
of
it
are
you
sure
she
is
hurt
oh
my
god
that
one
can
be
so
unhappy
and
yet
not
die
at
three
in
the
afternoon
rehnhjelm
left
for
stockholm
falander
slammed
the
carriage
door
behind
him
and
turned
the
handle
chapter
xxii
hard
times
to
sellén
also
the
autumn
had
brought
great
changes
his
powerful
patron
had
died
and
all
memory
of
him
was
to
be
blotted
out
even
the
memories
of
his
kind
actions
were
not
to
survive
him
that
stipend
was
stopped
went
without
saying
especially
as
the
artist
could
not
bring
himself
to
petition
for
its
continuance
he
did
not
believe
that
he
required
further
assistance
after
having
been
given
a
helping
hand
once
and
moreover
there
were
so
many
younger
members
of
his
profession
in
greater
need
of
it
but
he
was
made
to
realize
that
not
only
was
the
sun
extinguished
but
that
the
smaller
planets
too
suffered
from
total
eclipse
he
had
worked
strenuously
during
the
summer
and
had
made
great
progress
in
his
art
but
nevertheless
the
president
declared
that
it
had
deteriorated
and
that
his
success
in
the
spring
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
stroke
of
luck
the
professor
of
had
told
him
as
a
friend
that
he
would
never
be
a
great
artist
and
the
academician
had
seized
the
opportunity
to
rehabilitate
himself
and
clung
to
his
first
opinion
in
addition
to
this
the
public
taste
in
pictures
had
changed
the
ignorant
wealthy
handful
of
people
who
were
in
the
habit
of
buying
pictures
and
therefore
set
the
fashion
did
not
want
landscapes
but
portraits
of
the
and
summer
resorts
they
knew
and
it
was
difficult
to
sell
even
these
the
only
demand
was
for
sentimental
and
figures
therefore
sellén
had
fallen
on
evil
days
for
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
paint
against
his
better
judgment
he
was
now
renting
a
former
photographic
studio
on
the
top
of
a
house
in
government
street
the
accommodation
consisted
of
the
studio
itself
with
its
rotten
floor
and
leaking
roof
the
latter
defect
was
not
felt
at
present
for
it
was
winter
and
the
roof
was
covered
with
snow
and
the
old
which
smelt
of
collodium
and
for
this
reason
could
only
be
used
as
a
or
when
circumstances
permitted
the
purchase
of
fuel
the
only
piece
of
furniture
was
a
wooden
garden
seat
studded
with
protruding
nails
it
was
so
short
that
a
man
using
it
as
a
bed
and
it
was
always
used
as
a
bed
when
the
owner
or
rather
the
borrower
spent
the
night
at
home
had
either
to
draw
his
knees
up
to
his
chin
or
allow
his
legs
to
dangle
over
the
side
the
bedding
consisted
of
half
a
rug
the
other
half
was
at
the
pawnbroker
and
a
leather
case
stuffed
to
with
studies
and
sketches
in
the
was
a
water
tap
and
a
basin
with
a
waste
pipe
the
only
substitute
for
a
on
a
cold
afternoon
a
short
time
before
christmas
sellén
was
standing
before
his
easel
painting
for
the
third
time
a
new
picture
on
an
old
canvas
he
had
just
risen
from
his
hard
bed
no
servant
had
come
in
to
light
his
fire
partly
because
he
had
no
servant
and
partly
because
he
had
nothing
with
which
to
make
a
fire
no
servant
had
brushed
his
clothes
or
brought
his
coffee
and
yet
he
was
standing
before
his
easel
whistling
merrily
engaged
in
painting
a
brilliant
sunset
when
there
came
four
knocks
at
the
door
sellén
opened
without
hesitation
and
admitted
olle
montanus
very
plainly
and
very
lightly
clad
without
an
overcoat
good
morning
olle
how
are
you
did
you
sleep
well
thanks
how
the
oh
bad
and
the
notes
there
are
so
few
in
circulation
i
see
they
wo
issue
any
more
and
the
valuables
there
are
any
do
you
think
it
going
to
be
a
hard
winter
i
saw
a
great
many
chatterers
this
morning
that
means
a
hard
winter
you
took
a
morning
stroll
i
walked
about
all
night
after
leaving
the
red
room
at
midnight
you
were
at
the
red
room
last
night
yes
and
i
made
two
new
acquaintances
borg
and
a
man
called
levin
oh
those
rascals
i
know
them
why
did
you
spend
the
night
with
them
they
turned
up
their
noses
at
me
because
i
had
no
overcoat
and
i
felt
ashamed
but
i
am
worn
out
i
rest
for
a
few
moments
on
your
sofa
i
walked
through
the
whole
town
and
round
half
of
it
i
must
try
and
get
work
at
a
or
i
shall
starve
is
it
true
that
you
are
a
member
of
the
workmen
union
of
the
north
quite
true
i
going
to
lecture
there
on
sunday
next
on
sweden
a
good
subject
plenty
to
say
if
i
should
fall
asleep
on
your
sofa
do
waken
me
i
all
right
old
chap
go
to
sleep
a
few
moments
later
olle
was
fast
asleep
and
snoring
loudly
his
head
was
hanging
over
one
of
the
which
supported
his
thick
neck
and
his
legs
over
the
other
poor
devil
muttered
sellén
covering
him
up
with
his
rug
there
was
another
knock
but
as
it
was
unfamiliar
sellén
judged
it
wise
to
take
no
notice
of
it
thereupon
the
clamour
became
so
furious
that
it
dissipated
his
apprehensions
and
he
opened
the
door
to
borg
and
levin
borg
was
the
first
to
speak
is
falk
here
no
who
is
that
sack
of
wood
over
there
continued
borg
pointing
at
olle
with
his
olle
montanus
oh
that
extraordinary
fellow
who
was
with
falk
last
night
is
he
asleep
yes
did
he
spend
the
night
here
yes
why
have
you
a
fire
it
beastly
cold
because
i
have
no
wood
send
for
some
then
where
the
servant
i
make
her
trot
gone
to
early
service
wake
up
that
sleeping
ox
over
there
and
send
him
no
let
him
sleep
objected
sellén
covering
up
olle
who
was
still
snoring
loudly
then
i
must
show
you
another
way
what
the
earth
or
rubbish
i
do
understand
these
matters
replied
sellén
carefully
stepping
on
some
sheets
of
cardboard
which
were
lying
on
the
floor
have
you
got
another
piece
of
cardboard
what
are
you
driving
at
asked
sellén
colouring
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
i
want
it
and
a
pair
of
sellén
gave
him
the
required
articles
took
his
sketching
stool
and
sat
down
on
the
pieces
of
cardboard
as
if
he
were
guarding
a
treasure
borg
took
off
his
coat
and
with
the
help
of
the
loosened
a
board
in
the
floor
rotted
by
rain
and
acids
confound
you
what
are
you
doing
exclaimed
sellén
i
used
to
do
this
in
my
college
days
at
upsala
said
borg
but
you
ca
do
that
sort
of
thing
at
stockholm
hang
it
all
i
cold
i
must
have
a
fire
but
there
no
necessity
to
break
up
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
shows
too
much
what
does
that
matter
to
me
i
do
live
here
but
this
is
too
hard
meanwhile
he
had
approached
sellén
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
pushed
him
and
the
stool
over
in
falling
the
artist
dragged
the
pieces
of
cardboard
with
him
exposing
the
bare
underneath
miscreant
to
have
a
perfect
and
not
to
say
a
word
about
it
the
rain
done
it
i
do
care
who
done
it
let
light
a
fire
he
wrenched
off
a
few
pieces
of
wood
with
his
strong
hands
and
soon
a
fire
was
blazing
in
the
grate
levin
had
watched
the
scene
quiet
neutral
and
polite
borg
sat
down
before
the
fire
and
made
the
tongs
again
there
was
a
knock
three
short
raps
and
a
longer
one
that
falk
said
sellén
opening
the
door
falk
entered
looking
a
little
hectic
do
you
want
money
said
borg
to
the
newcomer
laying
his
hand
on
his
what
a
question
to
ask
said
falk
looking
at
him
doubtfully
how
much
do
you
want
i
can
let
you
have
it
are
you
serious
asked
falk
and
his
face
cleared
serious
hm
how
much
the
figure
the
amount
i
could
do
with
say
sixty
crowns
good
lord
how
modest
you
are
remarked
borg
and
turned
to
levin
yes
it
very
little
said
the
latter
take
as
much
as
you
can
get
falk
while
the
purse
is
open
i
rather
not
sixty
crowns
is
all
i
want
and
i
ca
afford
to
take
up
a
bigger
loan
but
how
is
it
to
be
paid
back
twelve
crowns
every
sixth
month
crowns
per
annum
in
two
instalments
said
levin
promptly
and
firmly
those
are
easy
terms
replied
falk
where
do
you
get
money
on
those
terms
from
the
wheelwrights
bank
give
me
paper
and
a
pen
levin
quick
as
lightning
levin
produced
a
promissory
note
a
pen
and
a
pocket
inkstand
the
note
had
already
been
filled
up
by
the
others
when
falk
saw
the
figure
eight
hundred
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
eight
hundred
crowns
he
asked
you
can
have
more
if
you
are
not
satisfied
no
i
wo
it
all
the
same
who
takes
the
money
as
long
as
it
is
paid
up
all
right
but
can
you
raise
money
on
a
bill
of
this
sort
without
security
without
security
you
are
forgetting
that
we
are
guaranteeing
it
replied
levin
with
contemptuous
familiarity
i
do
want
to
depreciate
it
observed
falk
i
grateful
for
your
guarantees
but
i
do
believe
that
the
bill
will
be
accepted
oh
wo
it
it
accepted
already
said
borg
bringing
out
a
of
as
he
called
it
go
on
falk
sign
falk
signed
his
name
borg
and
levin
were
watching
him
looking
over
his
shoulders
like
policemen
assessor
dictated
borg
no
i
a
journalist
objected
falk
that

curled
himself
up
like

little
while
nobody

olle
said
sellén
presently
breaking
the
silence

audiences
nicholas
falk
was
sitting
in
his
office
it
was
the
morning
of
the
day
before
christmas
eve
he
was
a
little
changed
time
had
thinned
his
fair
hair
and
the
passions
had
delved
little
channels
in
his
face
for
the
acids
which
the
parched
soil
distilled
he
was
stooping
over
a
little
book
of
the
shape
and
size
of
the
catechism
and
his
busy
pen
seemed
to
prick
out
designs
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
immediately
the
book
disappeared
beneath
the
flap
of
his
and
was
replaced
by
the
morning
paper
falk
was
absorbed
in
its
perusal
when
his
wife
entered
take
a
seat
he
said
politely
no
thank
you
i
in
a
hurry
have
you
read

morning
paper

and
the
other
half
after

the
case

ah

lundell
very
glad
to

locked
my
door
for
a
few
moments
it
really
was
lundell
lundell
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
like
a
shop
assistant
he
wore
a
rings
gloves
and
overshoes
i
am
not
calling
at
an
inconvenient
time
i
hope
not
at
all
do
you
think
lundell
that
you
will
be
able
to
finish
it
by
must
it
be
finished
by
it
absolutely
must
it
will
be
a
day
for
the
crèche
falk
will
publicly
present
my
portrait
to
the
institution
to
be
hung
in
the
then
we
must
not
let
any
obstacles
stand
in
our
way
replied
lundell
taking
an
easel
and
an
almost
finished
canvas
from
a
cupboard
if
you
will
sit
to
me
for
a
few
moments
sir
i
will
give
the
picture
the
finishing
touches
with
all
the
pleasure
in
the
world
falk
sat
down
in
a
chair
crossed
his
legs
threw
himself
into
the
attitude
of
a
statesman
and
tried
to
look
aristocratic
wo
you
talk
sir
although
your
face
is
an
exceedingly
interesting
one
when
at
rest
yet
the
more
characteristics
i
can
bring
out
the
better
falk
smirked
a
glimmer
of
pleasure
and
gratification
lit
up
his
coarse
features
i
hope
you
be
able
to
dine
with
us
on
bank
holiday
mr
lundell
thank
you
you
be
able
to
study
the
faces
of
many
men
of
distinction
then
men
whose
features
deserve
being
fixed
on
canvas
far
more
than
mine
do
perhaps
i
may
have
the
honour
of
painting
them
you
will
if
i
recommend
you
oh
do
you
really
think
so
certainly
i
do
i
just
caught
a
new
expression
in
your
face
try
and
keep
it
for
a
few
moments
there
this
is
excellent
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
work
at
this
portrait
all
day
long
there
are
so
many
details
which
one
only
discovers
gradually
your
face
is
rich
in
interesting
features
in
that
case
we
had
better
dine
together
we
must
see
a
good
deal
of
each
other
lundell
so
that
you
may
have
an
opportunity
of
studying
my
face
for
a
second
edition
which
it
is
always
well
to
have
really
i
must
say
there
are
few
people
to
whom
i
felt
so
strongly
drawn
from
the
first
moment
as
i
did
to
you
mr
lundell
oh
my
dear
sir
and
let
me
tell
you
that
my
eyes
are
keen
and
well
able
to
distinguish
truth
from
flattery
i
knew
that
from
the
first
answered
lundell
unscrupulously
my
profession
has
given
me
an
insight
into
human
character
you
are
a
very
keen
observer
indeed
not
everybody
understands
me
my
wife
for
instance
oh
women
can
not
be
expected
no
that
was
altogether
what
i
meant
but
may
i
offer
you
a
glass
of
good
old
port
thank
you
sir
i
never
drink
when
i
working
on
principle
quite
right
i
respect
this
principle
i
always
respect
principles
all
the
more
because
i
share
it
but
when
i
not
at
work
i
enjoy
a
glass
just
as
i
do
it
struck
twelve
falk
rose
excuse
me
i
must
leave
you
for
a
short
time
on
business
i
shall
be
back
almost
immediately
certainly
business
first
falk
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
went
lundell
was
left
alone
he
lit
a
cigar
and
studied
the
portrait
no
observer
however
keen
could
have
guessed
his
thoughts
he
had
acquired
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
art
of
life
to
hide
his
opinions
even
when
he
was
alone
nay
more
than
that
he
was
afraid
of
coming
to
a
clear
understanding
with
himself

greeted
on

with
friendly
compliments
and

everybody
wanted

said
the

nodding
to
him
across
the
table
i
fully
appreciate
your
talent
arvid
tranquilly
pocketed
the
insulting
compliment
why
are
your
poems
so
melancholy
asked
a
young
beauty
on
the
right
one
might
almost
think
you
were
suffering
from
an
unhappy
assessor
falk
allow
me
to
drink
your
health
said
the

of

left
stroking
his
long
blond
beard
why
do
you
write
for
my
paper
i
should
think
you
would
print
my
articles
replied
arvid
i
do
see
why
we
should
our
opinions
differ
so
very
widely
oh
that
is
half
as
bad
as
you
think
one
compromises
we
have
no
opinions
your
health
falk
shouted
the
excited
lundell
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
your
health
levi
and
borg
had
to
hold
him
otherwise
he
would
have
risen
and
made
a
speech
it
was
for
the
first
time
that
lundell
was
invited
to
a
dinner
of
this
sort
and
the
brilliant
assembly
and
luxurious
food
and
drink
intoxicated
him
but
as
all
the
guests
were
more
or
less
merry
he
fortunately
excited
no
unpleasant
attention
arvid
falk
heart
beat
faster
at
the
sight
of
all
these
people
who
had
readmitted
him
to
their
circle
without
asking
for
explanations
or
apologies
it
gave
him
a
sense
of
security
to
sit
on
those
old
chairs
which
had
been
a
part
of
the
home
of
his
childhood
with
a
feeling
of
melancholy
he
recognized
the
tall
which
in
the
old
times
had
only
seen
daylight
once
a
year
but
the
number
of
new
people
distracted
him
their
friendly
faces
did
not
deceive
him
certainly
they
did
not
wish
him
evil
but
their
friendship
depended
on
a
combination
of
circumstances
moreover
he
saw
the
whole
entertainment
in
the
light
of
a
masquerade
what
mutual
interest
could
possibly
form
a
bond
between
his
uncultured
brother
and
professor
borg
the
man
with
the
great
scientific
reputation
they
were
shareholders
in
the
same
company
what
was
the
proud
captain
gyllenborst
doing
here
had
he
come
for
the
sake
of
the
dinner
impossible
even
though
a
man
will
go
a
long
way
for
the
sake
of
a
good
dinner
and
the
president
the
admiral
there
must
have
been
invisible
ties
strong
unbreakable
ties
perhaps
the
mirth
increased
but
the
laughter
was
too
shrill
the
lips
were
overflowing
with
wit
but
the
wit
was
biting
falk
felt
ill
at
ease
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
father
eyes
were
looking
angrily
at
the
assembly
from
the
painted
canvas
which
hung
over
the
piano
nicholas
falk
beamed
with
satisfaction
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
any
unpleasantness
but
he
avoided
meeting
his
brother
eyes
as
much
as
possible
they
had
not
spoken
to
each
other
yet
for
arvid
in
compliance
with
levin
instructions
had
not
arrived
until
after
all
the
guests
had
been
assembled
the
dinner
was
approaching
its
end
nicholas
made
a
speech
on
the
stamina
and
firm
resolution
which
are
necessary
to
accomplish
a
purpose
the
achievement
of
financial
independence
and
a
good
social
position
these
two
qualities
said
the
speaker
raise
a
and
endow
him
with
that
firmness
without
which
his
efforts
are
unavailing
at
any
rate
as
far
as
the
general
good
is
concerned
and
the
general
welfare
gentlemen
must
always
be
our
highest
endeavour
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
the
truth
were
known
it
is
the
ambition
of
every
one
here
present
i
drink
the
health
of
all
those
who
have
this
day
honoured
my
house
and
i
hope
that
i
may
often
in
the
future
enjoy
the
same
privilege
captain
gyllenborst
who
was
slightly
intoxicated
replied
in
a
lengthy
facetious
speech
which
delivered
at
a
different
house
before
people
in
a
different
mood
would
have
been
called
scandalous
he
abused
the
commercial
spirit
which
was
spreading
and
declared
that
he
had
plenty
of
although
he
was
by
no
means
financially
independent
he
had
been
obliged
this
very
morning
to
settle
some
business
of
a
most
disagreeable
nature
but
in
spite
of
this
he
had
sufficient
strength
of
character
to
be
present
at
the
banquet
and
as
far
as
his
social
position
was
concerned
it
was
second
to
none
he
felt
sure
that
this
was
everybody
opinion
for
otherwise
he
would
not
be
sitting
at
this
table
the
guest
of
so
charming
a
host
when
he
had
concluded
the
party
drew
a
breath
of
relief
it
was
as
if
a
thundercloud
had
passed
over
our
heads
remarked
the
beauty
and
arvid
falk
heartily
agreed
there
was
so
much
humbug
so
much
deceit
in
the
atmosphere
that
arvid
longed
to
take
his
leave
these
people
who
appeared
so
honest
and
respectable
seemed
to
be
held
by
an
invisible
chain
at
which
they
tore
every
now
and
then
with
suppressed
fury
captain
gyllenborst
treated
his
host
with
open
though
facetious
contempt
he
smoked
a
cigar
in
the
generally
behaved
like
a
boor
and
took
no
notice
whatever
of
the
ladies
he
spat
in
the
mercilessly
criticized
the
oleographs
on
the
walls
and
loudly
expressed
his
contempt
for
the
mahogany
furniture
the
other
gentlemen
were
indifferent
they
gave
falk
the
impression
that
they
were
on
duty
irritated
and
upset
he
left
the
party
unnoticed
in
the
street
below
stood
olle
waiting
for
him
i
really
did
think
you
would
come
said
olle
it
so
beautifully
light
up
there
what
a
reason
i
wish
you
been
there
how
is
lundell
getting
on
in
smart
society
do
envy
him
he
wo
have
an
easy
time
if
he
going
to
make
his
way
as
a
but
let
talk
of
something
else
i
have
been
longing
for
this
evening
so
as
to
study
the
working
man
at
close
quarters
it
will
be
like
a
breath
of
fresh
air
after
these
deadly
fumes
i
feel
as
if
i
were
allowed
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
wood
after
having
long
been
laid
up
in
a
hospital
i
wonder
whether
i
shall
be
disillusioned
the
working
man
is
suspicious
you
will
have
to
be
careful
is
he
generous
free
from
pettiness
or
has
the
pressure
which
has
lain
on
him
for
so
long
spoiled
him
you
be
able
to
see
for
yourself
most
things
in
this
world
differ
from
our
expectations
that
true
unfortunately
half
an
hour
later
they
had
arrived
in
the
great
hall
of
the
working
men
union
star
of
the
north
the
place
was
already
crowded
black
did
not
create
a
good
impression
he
caught
many
an
unfriendly
glance
from
angry
eyes
olle
introduced
arvid
to
a
tall
gaunt
man
with
a
face
full
of
passion
who
seemed
to
be
troubled
with
an
incessant
cough
joiner
eriksson
that
me
said
the
latter
and
is
this
one
of
those
gentlemen
who
want
to
put
up
for
election
he
does
look
big
enough
for
that
no
no
said
olle
he
here
for
the
newspaper
which
newspaper
there
are
so
many
different
sorts
perhaps
he
come
to
make
fun
of
us
no
no
nothing
of
the
sort
said
olle
he
a
friend
and
he
do
all
he
can
for
you
i
see
that
alters
the
matter
but
i
do
trust
those
gentlemen
one
of
them
lived
with
us
that
is
to
say
we
lived
in
the
same
house
in
the
white
mountains
he
was
the
landlord
agent
struve
was
the
rascal
name
there
was
a
rap
with
the
hammer
the
chair
was
taken
by
an
elderly
man
wheelwright
löfgren
alderman
and
holder
of
the
medal
et
he
had
held
many
offices
and
acquired
a
great
deal
of
dramatic
routine
a
certain
venerability
capable
of
quelling
storms
and
silencing
noisy
meetings
characterized
him
his
broad
face
ornamented
by
and
a
pair
of
spectacles
was
framed
by
a
judge
wig
the
secretary
who
sat
at
his
side
was
one
of
the
supernumeraries
of
the
great
board
of
functionaries
he
wore
and
expressed
with
a
peasant
grin
his
dissatisfaction
with
everything
that
was
said
the
front
bench
was
filled
by
the
most
aristocratic
members
of
the
union
officers
government
officials
wholesale
merchants
they
supported
all
loyal
resolutions
and
with
their
superior
parliamentary
skill
voted
against
every
attempt
at
reform
the
secretary
read
the
minutes
which
the
front
bench
approved
next
the
first
item
of
the
agenda
was
read
the
preparatory
committee
would
suggest
that
the
working
men
union
of
the
north
should
express
the
dissatisfaction
which
every
citizen
must
feel
in
regard
to
the
unlawful
movements
which
under
the
name
of
strikes
are
spreading
nearly
all
over
europe
is
this
the
pleasure
of
the
union
yes
yes
shouted
the
front
bench
mr
president
called
out
the
joiner
from
the
white
mountains
who
is
making
so
much
noise
at
the
back
asked
the
chairman
looking
over
his
spectacles
with
a
face
which
suggested
that
he
would
presently
have
recourse
to
the
cane
nobody
is
making
any
noise
i
am
asking
for
permission
to
speak
who
is
i
eriksson
are
you
a
master
since
when
i
am
a
journeyman
out
of
my
time
i
have
never
had
the
means
to
be
made
free
of
the
city
but
i
am
every
bit
as
skilful
as
any
other
master
and
i
work
on
my
own
account
i
request
the
eriksson
to
sit
down
and
stop
interfering
is
it
the
pleasure
of
the
union
to
reply
to
the
question
in
the
affirmative
mr
chairman
what
is
the
matter
i
ask
permission
to
speak
let
me
speak
bellowed
eriksson
there
was
a
murmur
on
the
back
benches
eriksson
turn
to
speak
journeyman
eriksson
do
you
spell
your
name
with
an
x
or
a
z
asked
the
chairman
prompted
by
the
secretary
the
front
bench
shook
with
laughter
i
do
spell
gentlemen
i
discuss
said
the
joiner
with
blazing
eyes
i
discuss
i
say
if
i
had
the
gift
of
making
speeches
i
should
show
you
that
the
strikers
are
right
for
if
masters
and
principals
grow
fat
because
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
fawn
and
cringe
at
levees
and
similar
ceremonies
the
working
man
must
pay
the
piper
with
his
sweat
we
know
why
you
wo
pay
us
just
wages
it
because
we
should
get
the
parliamentary
vote
and
that
what
you
are
afraid
of
mr
chairman
captain
von
sporn
chairman
gentlemen
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
at
a
meeting
of
this
union
which
has
a
reputation
for
dignified
conduct
last
displayed
at
the
royal
wedding
people
without
the
smallest
trace
of
parliamentary
tact
should
be
permitted
to
compromise
a
respectable
society
by
a
shameless
and
reckless
contempt
of
all
seemliness
believe
me
gentlemen
such
a
thing
could
never
have
happened
in
a
country
where
from
early
youth
military
discipline
conscription
said
eriksson
to
olle
had
been
the
rule
where
the
habit
of
controlling
oneself
and
others
had
been
acquired
i
believe
i
am
expressing
the
general
feeling
of
the
meeting
when
i
say
that
i
hope
that
such
a
distressing
scene
may
never
again
occur
amongst
us
i
say
us
for
i
too
am
a
working
man
we
all
are
in
the
sight
of
the
eternal
and
i
say
it
as
a
member
of
this
union
the
day
would
be
a
day
of
mourning
when
i
should
find
myself
compelled
to
withdraw
the
words
which
i
recently
uttered
at
another
meeting
it
was
at
the
meeting
of
the
national
league
of
promoters
of
conscription
the
words
have
a
high
opinion
of
the
swedish
working
man
hear
hear
hear
hear
does
the
meeting
accept
the
suggestion
of
the
preparatory
committee
yes
yes
second
item
at
the
instigation
of
several
members
of
the
union
the
preparatory
committee
submit
to
the
meeting
the
proposal
to
collect
a
sum
not
exceeding
three
thousand
crowns
as
a
testimonial
to
the
duke
of
dalsland
at
his
forthcoming
confirmation
the
gift
is
to
be
an
expression
of
the
gratitude
of
the
working
man
to
the
royal
family
and
more
especially
of
his
disapproval
of
those
working
disturbances
which
under
the
name
of
devastated
the
french
capital
mr
chairman
doctor
haberfeld
no
it
i
eriksson
i
ask
permission
to
say
a
few
words
oh
well
eriksson
has
permission
to
speak
i
merely
want
to
point
out
that
not
the
working
men
but
officials
lawyers
officers
conscripts
and
journalists
were
to
blame
for
the
commune
at
paris
if
i
had
the
gift
of
making
speeches
i
should
ask
those
gentlemen
to
express
their
ideas
in
an
album
of
confessions
does
the
meeting
agree
to
the
proposal
yes
yes
and
the
clerks
began
to
write
and
to
check
and
to
chatter
exactly
as
they
had
done
at
the
parliamentary
meetings
are
things
always
managed
in
this
way
asked
falk
do
you
think
it
amusing
sir
said
eriksson
it
enough
to
turn
one
hair
grey
i
call
it
corruption
and
treachery
nothing
but
meanness
and
selfishness
there
is
a
man
amongst
them
who
has
the
cause
really
at
heart
and
therefore
the
things
which
must
happen
will
happen
what
things
we
see
said
the
joiner
taking
olle
hand
are
you
ready
hold
your
own
ground
you
be
sharply
criticized
olle
nodded
slyly
stonemason
journeyman
olle
montanus
has
announced
a
lecture
on
sweden
the
subject
is
a
big
one
but
if
he
will
promise
not
to
exceed
half
an
hour
we
will
hear
what
he
has
got
to
say
what
do
you
say
gentlemen
hear
hear
if
you
please
mr
montanus
olle
shook
himself
like
a
dog
about
to
jump
and
threaded
his
way
through
the
assembly
who
examined
him
with
curious
eyes
the
chairman
began
a
brief
conversation
with
the
front
bench
and
the
secretary
yawned
before
taking
up
a
newspaper
to
show
the
meeting
that
he
for
one
was
not
going
to
listen
olle
stepped
on
the
platform
lowered
his
heavy
eyelids
and
moved
his
jaws
pretending
to
be
speaking
when
the
room
had
grown
really
silent
so
silent
that
everybody
could
hear
what
the
chairman
said
to
the
captain
he
began
on
sweden
some
points
of
view
and
after
a
pause
gentlemen
it
might
be
more
than
an
unfounded
supposition
to
say
that
the
most
productive
idea
and
the
most
vigorous
striving
of
our
times
is
the
suppression
of
patriotism
which
divides
nations
and
pits
them
against
one
another
as
foes
we
have
seen
the
means
used
to
gain
this
object
namely
international
exhibitions
and
their
results
honorary
diplomas
the
audience
looked
puzzled
what
he
driving
at
said
eriksson
it
rather
unexpected
but
it
sounds
all
right
now
as
in
the
past
sweden
marches
at
the
head
of
civilization
she
has
more
than
any
other
nation
spread
the
cosmopolitan
ideal
and
if
one
may
rely
on
statistics
she
has
attained
a
great
deal
exceptionally
favourable
circumstances
have
contributed
to
this
result
i
will
examine
them
shortly
and
then
pass
on
to
lighter
subjects
such
as
the
form
of
government
the
and
so
on
it
going
to
be
rather
long
said
eriksson
nudging
arvid
but
an
amusing
chap
sweden
as
everybody
knows
was
originally
a
german
colony
and
the
swedish
language
which
has
been
preserved
fairly
pure
to
our
days
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
and
its
twelve
dialects
this
circumstance
i
mean
the
difficulty
of
communicating
with
one
another
experienced
by
the
provinces
has
been
a
powerful
factor
in
counteracting
the
development
of
that
unhealthy
national
feeling
other
fortunate
facts
have
opposed
a
german
influence
which
had
reached
its
pinnacle
when
sweden
became
a
german
province
under
albrecht
of
mecklenburg
the
foremost
of
these
facts
is
the
conquest
of
the
danish
provinces
scania
halland
bleking
bohuslän
and
dalsland
sweden
richest
provinces
are
inhabited
by
danes
who
still
speak
the
language
of
their
country
and
refuse
to
acknowledge
the
swedish
rule
what
in
the
name
of
fortune
is
he
getting
at
is
he
mad
the
inhabitants
of
scania
for
instance
to
this
day
look
upon
copenhagen
as
their
capital
and
constitute
the
opposition
in
parliament
the
same
thing
applies
to
the
danish
göteborg
which
does
not
acknowledge
stockholm
as
the
capital
of
the
realm
an
english
settlement
has
sprung
up
there
and
english
influence
is
predominant
these
people
the
english
people
fish
in
the
waters
near
the
coast
and
during
the
winter
very
nearly
all
the
wholesale
trade
is
in
their
hands
they
return
to
their
own
country
in
the
summer
and
enjoy
their
winter
profits
in
their
villas
in
the
scotch
highlands
very
excellent
people
though
they
have
even
their
own
newspaper
in
which
they
commend
their
own
actions
without
it
must
be
admitted
blaming
those
of
others
immigration
is
another
factor
of
the
utmost
importance
we
have
the
fins
in
the
finnish
forests
but
we
also
have
them
in
the
capital
where
they
took
refuge
when
the
political
situation
drove
them
out
of
their
own
country
in
all
our
more
important
you
will
find
a
fair
number
of
walloons
they
came
over
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
to
this
day
speak
their
broken
french
you
all
know
that
we
owe
the
new
swedish
constitution
to
a
walloon
capable
people
these
walloons
and
very
honest
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
does
it
all
mean
in
the
reign
of
king
gustavus
adolphus
a
whole
cargo
of
scotch
scum
landed
on
our
coast
and
took
service
in
the
army
they
eventually
forced
their
way
into
the
house
of
knights
at
the
east
coast
there
are
many
families
who
cherish
traditions
of
their
immigration
from
livland
and
other
slavonic
provinces
and
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
we
frequently
meet
here
pure
tartar
types
i
maintain
that
the
swedish
nation
is
fast
becoming
denationalized
open
a
book
on
heraldry
and
count
the
swedish
names
if
they
exceed
per
cent
you
may
cut
off
my
nose
gentlemen
open
the
directory
at
random
i
counted
the
letter
g
and
of
four
hundred
names
two
hundred
were
foreign
what
is
the
cause
of
this
there
are
many
causes
but
the
principal
ones
are
the
foreign
dynasties
and
the
wars
of
conquest
if
one
thinks
of
all
the
scum
that
has
sat
on
the
swedish
throne
at
one
time
or
another
one
can
not
help
marvelling
that
the
nation
is
so
loyal
to
the
king
the
constitutional
law
that
the
kings
of
sweden
shall
be
foreigners
is
bound
to
be
of
the
greatest
assistance
in
the
work
of
denationalization
this
has
been
proved
to
be
a
fact
i
am
convinced
that
the
country
will
gain
by
its
alliance
with
foreign
nations
it
can
not
lose
anything
because
it
has
nothing
to
lose
the
country
has
no
nationality
tegnér
discovered
that
in
and
bemoaned
the
fact
but
his
discovery
came
too
late
for
the
race
had
already
been
ruined
by
the
constant
recruiting
for
the
foolish
wars
of
conquest
of
the
one
million
men
which
inhabited
the
country
in
the
days
of
gustavus
adolphus
seventy
thousand
enlisted
and
were
killed
in
the
wars
i
do
not
know
for
how
many
charles
x
charles
xi
and
charles
xii
were
responsible
but
it
is
easy
to
picture
the
offspring
of
those
who
remained
behind
the
men
whom
the
crown
had
rejected
as
unfit
for
service
i
repeat
my
statement
that
sweden
has
no
nationality
can
anybody
tell
me
of
anything
swedish
in
sweden
except
her
firs
pine
trees
and
and
the
latter
will
soon
disappear
from
the
market
what
is
our
but
bad
translations
of
french
english
and
german
ballads
what
are
the
national
costumes
the
disappearance
of
which
we
so
keenly
regret
other
than
fragments
and
tatters
of
the
aristocratic
mediæval
costumes
in
the
days
of
gustavus
i
the
dalesmen
demanded
that
all
those
who
wore
or
dresses
should
be
punished
probably
the
gay
from
burgundy
had
not
yet
filtered
down
to
the
daleswomen
but
since
then
the
fashion
has
changed
many
times
tell
me
of
a
swedish
poem
a
work
of
art
a
piece
of
music
so
specifically
swedish
that
it
differs
from
all
other
ones
show
me
a
swedish
building
there
is
one
and
if
there
were
it
would
either
be
bad
architecture
or
built
in
a
foreign
style
i
do
think
i
exaggerating
when
i
maintain
that
the
swedish
nation
is
a
stupid
conceited
slavish
envious
and
uncouth
nation
and
for
this
reason
it
is
approaching
its
end
and
approaching
it
with
giant
strides
a
tumult
arose
in
the
hall
but
shouts
of
charles
xii
could
be
heard
above
the
turmoil
gentlemen
charles
xii
is
dead
let
him
sleep
until
his
next
jubilee
to
no
one
are
we
more
indebted
for
our
denationalisation
than
to
him
and
therefore
gentlemen
i
call
for
three
cheers
for
charles
xii
gentlemen
long
live
charles
xii
i
call
the
meeting
to
order
shouted
the
chairman
is
it
possible
to
imagine
that
a
nation
can
be
guilty
of
a
greater
piece
of
folly
than
to
go
to
foreign
nations
in
order
to
learn
to
write
poetry
what
unsurpassable
oxen
they
must
have
been
to
walk
for
sixteen
hundred
years
behind
the
plough
and
never
conceive
the
idea
of
inventing
a
song
then
a
jolly
fellow
of
the
court
of
charles
xii
came
along
and
destroyed
the
whole
work
of
denationalization
the
literary
language
which
up
to
now
had
been
german
was
henceforth
to
be
swedish
down
with
the
dog
stjernhjelm
what
was
his
name
edward
stjernström
the
chairman
hammer
came
down
on
the
table
with
a
bang
the
disturbance
grew
stop
him
down
with
the
traitor
he
laughing
at
us
the
swedish
nation
can
scream
and
brawl
i
am
aware
of
that
they
can
do
nothing
else
and
as
you
will
not
allow
me
to
continue
my
lecture
and
discuss
the
government
and
the
royal
copyholds
i
will
conclude
by
saying
that
the
servile
louts
whom
i
have
heard
are
ripe
for
the
autocracy
which
they
are
sure
to
get
believe
my
words
you
will
have
an
absolute
monarchy
before
very
long
a
push
from
the
back
jerked
the
words
of
the
speaker
out
of
his
throat
he
clung
to
the
table
and
an
ungrateful
race
who
will
not
listen
to
the
truth
kick
him
out
tear
him
to
pieces
olle
was
dragged
from
the
platform
but
to
the
last
moment
while
knocks
and
blows
rained
down
on
him
he
yelled
like
a
madman
long
live
charles
xii
down
with
george
stjernhjelm
at
last
olle
and
arvid
were
standing
in
the
street
whatever
were
you
thinking
of
asked
falk
you
must
have
taken
leave
of
your
senses
i
believe
i
had
i
had
learnt
my
speech
by
heart
for
the
last
six
weeks
i
knew
to
a
word
what
i
was
going
to
say
but
when
i
stood
on
the
platform
and
saw
all
those
eyes
gazing
at
me
it
all
went
to
pieces
my
artificial
arguments
broke
down
like
a
scaffolding
the
floor
underneath
my
feet
gave
way
and
my
thoughts
became
confusion
was
it
very
crazy
yes
it
was
bad
and
the
papers
will
pull
you
to
pieces
that
a
pity
i
admit
i
thought
i
was
making
it
all
so
clear
but
it
fun
to
give
it
them
for
once
you
only
injured
your
cause
they
never
let
you
speak
again
olle
sighed
why
in
the
name
of
fortune
could
you
leave
charles
xii
alone
that
was
your
worst
mistake
do
ask
me
i
do
know
do
you
still
love
the
working
man
asked
falk
i
pity
him
for
allowing
himself
to
be
humbugged
by
adventurers
and
i
shall
never
abandon
his
cause
for
his
cause
is
the
burning
question
of
the
near
future
and
all
your
politics
are
worth
a
penny
in
comparison
the
two
friends
were
making
their
way
back
to
old
stockholm
and
finally
entered
a
café
it
was
between
nine
and
ten
and
the
room
was
almost
empty
a
single
customer
was
sitting
near
the
counter
he
was
reading
from
a
book
to
a
girl
who
sat
beside
him
doing
needlework
it
was
a
pretty
domestic
scene
but
it
seemed
to
make
a
strong
impression
on
falk
who
started
violently
and
changed
colour
sellén
you
here
good
evening
beda
he
said
with
artificial
cordiality
which
sat
strangely
on
him
shaking
hands
with
the
girl
hallo
falk
old
chap
said
sellén
so
you
are
in
the
habit
of
coming
here
too
i
might
have
guessed
it
you
are
hardly
ever
at
the
red
room
now
arvid
and
beda
exchanged
glances
the
young
girl
looked
too
distinguished
for
her
position
she
had
a
delicate
intelligent
face
which
betrayed
a
secret
sorrow
and
a
slender
figure
her
movements
were
full
of
and
modesty
her
eyes
were
set
in
her
face
at
a
slightly
upward
angle
they
seemed
to
be
peering
skyward
as
if
they
were
anticipating
evil
to
drop
down
from
the
clouds
with
this
exception
they
looked
as
if
they
were
ready
to
play
all
the
games
which
the
whim
of
the
moment
might
dictate
how
grave
you
are
she
said
to
arvid
and
her
gaze
dropped
to
her
sewing
i
been
to
a
grave
meeting
said
arvid
blushing
like
a
girl
what
were
you
reading
i
was
reading
the
dedication
from
faust
said
sellén
stretching
out
his
hand
and
playing
with
beda
needlework
a
cloud
darkened
arvid
face
the
conversation
became
forced
and
restrained
olle
sat
plunged
in
meditations
the
subject
of
which
must
have
been
suicide
arvid
asked
for
a
paper
and
was
given
the
he
remembered
that
he
had
forgotten
to
look
for
the
review
of
his
poems
he
hastily
opened
the
paper
and
on
page
three
he
found
what
he
sought
his
eyes
met
neither
compliments
nor
abuse
the
article
was
dictated
by
genuine
and
deep
interest
the
reviewer
found
arvid
poetry
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
average
but
just
as
selfish
and
meaningless
he
said
that
it
treated
only
of
the
poet
private
affairs
of
illicit
relations
real
or
fictitious
that
it
coquetted
with
little
sins
but
did
not
mourn
over
great
ones
that
it
was
no
better
than
the
english
poetry
and
he
suggested
that
the
author
portrait
should
have
preceded
the
then
the
poems
would
have
been
illustrated
these
simple
truths
made
a
great
impression
on
arvid
he
had
only
read
the
advertisement
in
the
written
by
struve
and
the
review
in
the
coloured
by
personal
friendship
he
rose
with
a
brief
are
you
going
already
asked
beda
yes
are
we
going
to
meet
yes
as
usual
sellén
and
olle
followed
him
she
a
rare
child
said
sellén
after
they
had
proceeded
a
little
way
in
silence
i
should
thank
you
to
be
a
little
more
restrained
in
your
criticism
i
see
you
in
love
with
her
yes
i
hope
you
do
mind
not
in
the
least
i
sha
get
into
your
way
and
i
beg
you
not
to
believe
any
evil
of
her
of
course
i
wo
she
been
on
the
stage
how
do
you
know
she
never
told
me
that
no
but
she
told
me
one
can
never
trust
these
little
devils
too
far
oh
well
there
no
harm
in
that
i
shall
take
her
away
from
her
surroundings
as
soon
as
i
possibly
can
our
relations
are
limited
to
meeting
in
the
haga
park
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
drinking
the
water
from
the
well
how
sweet
and
simple
do
you
never
take
her
out
to
supper
i
never
thought
of
making
such
an
improper
suggestion
she
would
refuse
it
with
scorn
you
are
laughing
laugh
if
you
like
i
still
have
faith
in
a
woman
who
loves
whatever
class
she
may
belong
to
and
whatever
her
past
may
have
been
she
told
me
that
her
life
had
not
been
above
reproach
but
i
have
promised
never
to
ask
her
about
her
past
is
it
serious
then
yes
it
is
serious
that
another
thing
falk
are
you
coming
with
me
olle
good
night
poor
falk
said
sellén
to
olle
now
it
his
turn
to
go
through
the
mill
but
there
no
help
for
it
it
like
changing
one
teeth
a
man
is
not
grown
up
until
he
has
had
his
experience
what
about
the
girl
asked
olle
merely
in
order
to
show
a
polite
interest
for
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
she
all
right
in
her
way
but
falk
takes
the
matter
seriously
she
does
too
apparently
as
long
as
she
sees
any
prospect
of
winning
him
but
unless
falk
quick
about
it
she
will
grow
tired
of
waiting
and
who
knows
whether
she
wo
amuse
herself
meanwhile
with
somebody
else
no
you
do
understand
these
things
a
man
should
hesitate
in
a
but
grab
with
both
hands
otherwise
somebody
else
will
step
in
and
spoil
the
game
have
you
ever
been
in
love
olle
i
had
an
affair
with
one
of
our
servants
at
home
there
were
consequences
and
my
father
turned
me
out
of
the
house
since
then
i
have
looked
at
a
woman
that
was
nothing
very
complicated
but
to
be
betrayed
as
it
is
called
that
what
hurts
i
can
tell
you
one
must
have
nerves
like
the
strings
of
a
violin
to
play
that
game
we
shall
see
what
sort
of
a
fight
falk
will
make
with
some
men
it
goes
very
deep
and
that
a
pity
the
door
is
open
come
in
olle
i
hope
the
beds
are
properly
made
so
that
you
will
lie
softly
but
you
must
excuse
my
old
she
can
not
shake
up
the
her
fingers
are
weak
do
you
see
and
the
pillow
i
afraid
may
be
hard
and
lumpy
they
had
climbed
the
stairs
and
were
entering
the
studio
it
smells
damp
as
if
the
servant
had
aired
the
room
or
scrubbed
it
you
are
laughing
at
yourself
there
can
be
no
more
scrubbing
you
have
no
longer
a
floor
have
i
ah
that
makes
a
difference
but
what
has
become
of
it
has
it
been
used
for
fuel
there
nothing
for
it
then
but
to
lie
down
on
our
mother
earth
or
rubbish
or
whatever
it
may
be
they
lay
down
in
their
clothes
on
the
having
made
a
kind
of
bed
for
themselves
of
pieces
of
canvas
and
old
newspapers
and
pushed
cases
filled
with
sketches
underneath
their
heads
olle
struck
a
match
produced
a
tallow
candle
from
his
trousers
pocket
and
put
it
on
the
floor
beside
him
a
faint
gleam
flickered
through
the
huge
bare
studio
passionately
resisting
the
volumes
of
darkness
which
tried
to
pour
in
through
the
colossal
windows
it
cold
said
olle
opening
a
greasy
book
cold
oh
no
there
are
only
twenty
degrees
of
frost
outside
and
thirty
in
here
because
we
are
so
high
up
what
the
time
i
wonder
i
believe
john
just
struck
one
john
they
have
no
clock
they
are
so
poor
that
they
had
to
pawn
it
there
was
a
long
pause
which
was
finally
broken
by
sellén
what
are
you
reading
olle
never
mind
never
mind
had
you
better
be
more
civil
seeing
that
you
are
my
guest
an
old
cookery
book
which
i
borrowed
from
ygberg
the
deuce
you
did
do
let
read
it
i
only
had
a
cup
of
coffee
and
three
glasses
of
water
what
would
you
like
asked
olle
turning
over
the
leaves
would
you
like
some
fish
do
you
know
what
a
mayonnaise
is
mayonnaise
no
read
it
it
sounds
good
well
listen
no
mayonnaise
take
some
butter
flour
and
a
pinch
of
english
mustard
and
make
it
into
a
smooth
paste
beat
it
up
with
good
stock
and
when
boiling
add
the
yolks
of
a
few
eggs
beat
well
and
let
it
stand
to
cool
no
thank
you
that
not
filling
enough
oh
but
that
not
all
then
take
a
few
spoonfuls
of
fine
salad
oil
vinegar
a
spoonful
of
cream
some
white
pepper
oh
yes
i
see
now
it
no
good
do
you
want
something
more
substantial
try
and
find
it
my
favourite
dish
i
ca
go
on
reading
do
no
leave
me
alone
they
were
silent
the
candle
went
out
and
it
was
quite
dark
olle
wrap
yourself
well
up
or
you
be
cold
what
with
i
do
know
are
we
having
a
jolly
time
i
wonder
why
one
does
kill
oneself
when
one
is
so
cold
because
it
would
be
wrong
i
find
it
quite
interesting
to
live
if
only
to
see
what
will
come
of
it
all
in
the
end
are
your
parents
alive
sellén
no
i
illegitimate
yours
yes
but
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
you
should
be
more
grateful
to
providence
olle
one
should
always
be
grateful
to
providence
i
do
quite
know
why
but
i
suppose
one
should
again
there
was
silence
the
next
time
it
was
olle
who
broke
it
are
you
asleep
no
i
thinking
of
the
statue
of
gustavus
adolphus
would
you
believe
me
when
i
are
you
cold
cold
it
quite
warm
here
my
right
foot
is
frozen
pull
the
paint
box
over
you
and
tuck
the
brushes
round
your
sides
then
you
be
warmer
do
you
think
anybody
in
the
world
is
as
badly
off
as
we
are
badly
off
do
you
call
us
badly
off
when
we
have
a
roof
over
our
heads
some
of
the
professors
at
the
academy
men
who
wear
hats
and
swords
now
were
much
worse
off
than
we
are
professor
lundström
slept
during
nearly
the
whole
of
april
in
the
theatre
in
the
hop
garden
there
was
style
in
that
he
had
the
whole
of
the
left
and
he
maintains
that
after
one
there
was
a
single
stall
vacant
there
was
always
a
good
house
in
the
winter
and
a
bad
one
in

but
olle
rose
and
paced
the
room
up
and
down
until
the
dawn
broke
in
the
east
then
day
took
pity
on
him
and
gave
him
the
peace
which
night
had
denied

the
winter
passed
slowly
for
the
sufferers
more
quickly
for
those
who
were
less
unhappy
spring
came
with
its
disappointed
hopes
of
sun
and
verdure
and
in
its
turn
made
room
for
the
summer
which
was
but
a
short
introduction
to
the
autumn
on
a
may
morning
arvid
falk
now
a
member
of
the
permanent
staff
of
the
was
strolling
along
the
quay
watching
the
vessels
loading
and
discharging
their
cargoes
he
looked
less
than
in
days
gone
by
his
black
hair
was
longer
than
fashion
decreed
and
he
wore
a
beard
à
la
henri
iv
which
gave
his
thin
face
an
almost
savage
expression
an
ominous
fire
burned
in
his
eyes
a
fire
denoting
the
fanatic
or
the
drunkard
he
seemed
to
be
endeavouring
to
make
a
choice
among
the
vessels
but
was
unable
to
come
to
a
decision
after
hesitating
for
a
considerable
time
he
accosted
one
of
the
sailors
who
was
wheeling
a
barrow
full
of
goods
on
to
a
brig
he
courteously
raised
his
hat
can
you
tell
me
the
destination
of
this
ship
he
asked
timidly
imagining
that
he
was
speaking
in
a
bold
voice
ship
i
see
no
ship
the
bystanders
laughed
but
if
you
want
to
know
where
this
brig
bound
for
go
and
read
that
bill
over
there
falk
was
disconcerted
but
he
forced
himself
to
say
angrily
ca
you
give
a
civil
reply
to
a
civil
question
go
to
hell
and
do
stand
there
swearing
at
a
fellow
the
conversation
broke
off
and
falk
made
up
his
mind
he
retraced
his
footsteps
passed
through
a
narrow
street
crossed
a
and
turned
the
first
corner
before
the
door
of
a
house
he
stopped
again
he
hesitated
he
could
never
overcome
his
besetting
sin
of
indecision
a
small
ragged
boy
with
a
squint
came
running
along
his
hands
full
of
proofs
in
long
strips
as
he
was
going
to
pass
falk
the
latter
stopped
him
is
the
editor
upstairs
he
asked
yes
he
been
here
since
seven
replied
the
boy
breathlessly
has
he
asked
for
me
yes
more
than
once
is
he
in
a
bad
temper
he
always
is
the
boy
shot
upstairs
like
an
arrow
falk
following
on
his
heels
entered
the
editorial
office
it
was
a
hole
with
two
windows
looking
on
a
dark
street
before
each
of
the
windows
stood
a
plain
deal
table
covered
with
paper
pens
newspapers
scissors
and
a
gum
bottle
one
of
the
tables
was
occupied
by
his
old
friend
ygberg
dressed
in
a
ragged
black
coat
engaged
in
reading
proofs
at
the
other
table
which
was
falk
sat
a
man
in
shirt
sleeves
his
head
covered
by
a
black
silk
cap
of
the
kind
affected
by
the
communards
his
face
was
covered
by
a
red
beard
and
his
figure
with
its
clumsy
outlines
betrayed
the
man
of
the
people
as
falk
entered
the
communard
legs
kicked
the
table
violently
he
turned
up
his
displaying
blue
tattoo
marks
representing
an
anchor
and
an
r
seized
a
pair
of
scissors
savagely
stabbed
the
front
page
of
a
morning
paper
cut
out
a
paragraph
and
said
rudely
with
his
back
to
falk
where
have
you
been
i
been
ill
replied
falk
defiantly
as
he
thought
but
humbly
as
ygberg
told
him
afterwards
it
a
lie
you
been
drinking
i
saw
you
at
a
café
last
night
surely
i
can
go
where
i
please
you
can
do
what
you
like
but
you
got
to
be
here
at
the
stroke
of
the
clock
according
to
our
agreement
it
a
quarter
past
eight
i
am
well
aware
that
gentlemen
who
have
been
to
college
where
they
imagine
they
learn
a
lot
have
no
idea
of
method
and
manners
do
you
call
it
to
be
late
at
your
work
are
you
behaving
like
a
boor
when
you
compel
your
employer
to
do
your
work
what
it
the
world
turned
upside
down
the
employé
treats
the
master
the
employer
if
you
like
as
if
he
were
a
dog
and
capital
is
oppressed
when
did
you
come
to
these
conclusions
when
just
now
sir
just
now
and
i
trust
these
conclusions
are
worth
considering
in
spite
of
that
but
i
discovered
something
else
you
are
an
ignoramus
you
ca
spell
look
at
this
what
written
here
read
it
hope
that
all
those
who
will
have
to
go
through
their
drill
next
year
is
it
possible
next
year
well
that
quite
right
said
falk
right
how
dare
you
say
it
right
it
customary
to
say
in
the
next
and
consequently
it
should
also
be
written
in
this
form
that
right
too
definitions
of
time
govern
either
the
accusative
or
none
of
your
learned
palaver
do
talk
nonsense
to
me
besides
this
you
spell
with
an
x
only
although
it
should
be
spelt
do
make
excuses
is
it
or
of
course
people
say
people
say
therefore
is
right
the
customary
pronunciation
must
be
correct
perhaps
all
things
considered
i
a
fool
perhaps
i
ca
spell
correctly
but
enough
now
get
to
work
and
another
time
pay
a
little
more
attention
to
the
clock
he
jumped
up
from
his
chair
with
a
yell
and
boxed
the
ears
of
the
printer
boy
are
you
sleeping
in
bright
daylight
you
young
scamp
i
teach
you
to
keep
awake
you
are
not
yet
too
old
for
a
thrashing
he
seized
the
victim
by
the
braces
threw
him
on
a
pile
of
unsold
papers
and
beat
him
with
his
belt
i
was
asleep
i
was
asleep
i
was
only
closing
my
eyes
a
little
howled
the
boy
what
you
dare
to
deny
it
you
learned
to
lie
but
i
will
teach
you
to
speak
the
truth
were
you
asleep
or
were
you
not
asleep
tell
the
truth
or
you
be
sorry
for
it
i
was
asleep
whimpered
the
boy
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
get
over
his
difficulty
by
telling
a
lie
i
see
you
mean
to
stand
by
your
lie
you
hardened
little
devil
you
insolent
liar
he
was
going
to
continue
the
thrashing
when
falk
rose
approached
the
editor
and
said
firmly
do
touch
him
i
saw
that
he
was
not
asleep
by
jove
listen
to
him
who
the
dickens
are
you
do
touch
him
who
said
those
words
i
must
have
heard
a
gnat
buzzing
or
perhaps
my
ears
deceived
me
i
hope
so
i
do
hope
so
ygberg
you
are
a
decent
fellow
you
have
been
to
college
did
you
happen
to
see
whether
this
boy
whom
i
holding
by
the
braces
like
a
fish
was
asleep
or
not
if
he
was
asleep
replied
ygberg
phlegmatically
and
obligingly
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
dropping
off
well
answered
would
you
mind
holding
him
ygberg
while
i
give
him
a
lesson
with
my
cane
in
telling
the
truth
you
no
right
to
beat
him
said
falk
if
you
dare
to
touch
him
i
shall
open
the
window
and
call
for
the
police
i
am
master
in
my
own
house
and
i
always
thrash
my
apprentices
he
is
an
apprentice
and
will
be
employed
in
the
editorial
office
later
on
that
what
going
to
be
done
although
there
are
people
who
imagine
that
a
paper
can
only
be
properly
edited
by
a
man
who
has
been
to
college
speak
up
gustav
are
you
learning
newspaper
work
answer
but
tell
the
truth
or
before
the
boy
had
time
to
reply
the
door
was
opened
and
a
head
looked
in
a
very
striking
head
and
certainly
not
one
that
might
have
been
expected
in
such
a
place
but
it
was
a
head
it
had
been
painted
five
times
at
the
sight
of
it
the
editor
strapped
his
belt
round
him
hastily
put
on
his
coat
bowed
and
smiled
the
visitor
asked
whether
the
editor
was
disengaged
he
received
a
satisfactory
reply
and
the
last
remnant
of
the
working
man
disappeared
when
a
quick
movement
swept
the
communard
cap
off
the
editor
head
both
men
went
into
an
inner
office
and
the
door
closed
behind
them
i
wonder
what
the
count
after
said
ygberg
with
the
air
of
a
schoolboy
when
the
master
had
left
the
i
do
wonder
in
the
least
said
falk
i
think
i
know
the
kind
of
rascal
he
is
and
the
kind
of
rascal
the
editor
is
but
i
am
surprised
to
find
that
you
have
changed
from
a
mere
blockhead
into
an
infamous
wretch
and
that
you
lend
yourself
to
these
disgraceful
acts
do
lose
your
temper
my
dear
fellow
you
were
not
at
the
house
last
night
no
in
my
opinion
parliament
is
a
farce
except
in
so
far
as
private
interests
are
concerned
what
about
the
the
question
was
put
to
the
vote
and
it
was
resolved
that
the
government
in
view
of
the
greatness
the
patriotism
which
characterized
the
enterprise
should
take
over
the
debentures
while
the
society
went
into
liquidation
that
is
to
say
settled
the
current
affairs
which
means
that
government
will
prop
up
the
house
while
the
foundation
crumbles
away
so
as
to
give
the
directors
time
to
get
out
of
harm
way
you
would
rather
that
all
those
small
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
all
those
small
capitalists
yes
i
would
rather
see
them
working
with
their
small
capital
than
idling
away
their
time
and
lending
it
out
at
interest
but
above
all
things
i
should
like
to
see
those
sharpers
in
prison
it
would
help
to
put
a
stop
to
these
swindles
but
they
call
it
political
economy
it
vile
there
something
else
i
want
to
say
you
covet
my
post
you
shall
have
it
i
hate
the
idea
of
your
sitting
in
your
corner
with
a
heart
filled
with
bitterness
because
you
have
to
sweep
up
after
me
in
reading
proofs
there
are
already
too
many
of
my
unprinted
articles
lying
on
the
desk
of
this
contemptible
apostle
of
liberty
to
tempt
me
to
go
on
telling
stories
the
was
too
conservative
to
please
me
but
the
is
too
dirty
i
am
glad
to
see
you
relinquishing
your
chimeras
and
listening
to
common
sense
go
to
the
you
have
a
chance
there
i
have
lost
the
illusion
that
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
lies
in
good
hands
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
splendid
mission
to
enlighten
the
people
on
the
value
of
public
opinion
especially
printed
public
opinion
and
its
origin
but
i
shall
never
abandon
the
cause
the
door
to
the
inner
room
opened
again
and
the
editor
came
out
he
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
office
and
said
in
an
unnaturally
conciliatory
voice
almost
politely
i
want
you
to
look
after
the
office
for
a
day
falk
i
have
to
go
away
on
important
business
ygberg
will
assist
you
so
far
as
the
daily
business
is
concerned
his
lordship
will
be
using
my
room
for
a
few
minutes
i
hope
gentlemen
you
will
see
that
he
has
everything
he
wants
oh
please
do
trouble
came
the
count
voice
from
inside
the
room
where
he
was
sitting
bent
over
a
manuscript
the
editor
went
and
strange
to
say
two
minutes
later
the
count
went
also
he
had
waited
just
long
enough
to
avoid
being
seen
in
the
company
of
the
editor
of
the
are
you
sure
that
he
gone
asked
ygberg
i
hope
so
said
falk
then
i
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
market
have
you
seen
beda
since
since
when
since
she
left
the
café
and
went
to
live
in
a
room
by
herself
how
do
you
know
she
did
do
control
your
temper
falk
you
never
get
on
in
the
world
unless
you
do
yes
you
right
i
must
take
matters
more
calmly
or
else
i
go
out
of
my
mind
but
that
girl
whom
i
loved
so
dearly
how
shamefully
she
has
treated
me
to
give
to
that
clumsy
boor
all
she
denied
to
me
and
then
to
have
the
face
to
tell
me
that
it
proved
the
purity
of
her
love
for
me
most
excellent
dialectics
and
she
is
quite
right
too
for
her
first
proposition
is
correct
she
does
love
you
does
she
she
running
after
me
anyhow
and
you
i
hate
her
with
all
my
soul
but
i
am
afraid
to
meet
her
which
proves
that
you
are
still
in
love
with
her
let
change
the
subject
you
really
must
control
yourself
falk
take
an
example
from
me
but
now
i
go
and
sun
myself
one
should
enjoy
life
as
much
as
possible
in
this
dreary
world
gustav
you
can
go
and
play
buttons
for
an
hour
if
you
like
falk
was
left
alone
the
sun
threw
his
rays
over
the
steep
roof
opposite
and
warmed
the
room
he
opened
the
window
and
put
out
his
head
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
but
he
only
breathed
the
pungent
odours
of
the
gutter
his
glance
swept
the
street
on
the
right
and
far
away
in
the
distance
he
saw
a
part
of
a
steamer
a
few
waves
of
the
lake
of
mälar
glittering
in
the
sunlight
and
a
hollow
in
the
rocks
on
the
other
side
which
were
just
beginning
to
show
a
little
green
here
and
there
he
thought
of
the
people
whom
that
steamer
would
take
into
the
country
who
would
bathe
in
those
waves
and
feast
their
eyes
on
the
young
green
but
at
this
moment
the
whitesmith
below
him
began
to
hammer
a
sheet
of
iron
so
that
house
and
window
panes
trembled
two
or
three
labourers
went
by
with
a
rattling
cart
and
an
odour
of
brandy
beer
sawdust
and
poured
out
of
the
inn
opposite
he
shut
the
window
and
sat
down
at
his
table
before
him
lay
a
heap
of
about
a
hundred
provincial
papers
from
which
it
was
his
task
to
make
cuttings
he
took
off
his
cuffs
and
began
to
look
through
them
they
smelt
of
oil
and
soot
and
blackened
his
hands
that
was
their
principal
feature
nothing
he
considered
worthy
of
reprinting
was
of
any
use
for
he
had
to
consider
the
programme
of
his
paper
a
report
to
the
effect
that
the
workmen
of
a
certain
factory
had
given
the
foreman
a
silver
had
to
be
cut
out
but
the
notice
of
a
manufacturer
having
given
five
hundred
crowns
to
his
funds
had
to
be
ignored
a
paragraph
reporting
that
the
duke
of
halland
had
handselled
a
and
director
holzheim
celebrated
the
event
in
verses
had
to
be
cut
out
and
reproduced
in
full
because
the
people
liked
to
read
this
kind
of
thing
if
he
could
add
a
little
biting
sarcasm
all
the
better
for
then
they
were
sure
to
hear
about
it
roughly
speaking
the
rule
was
to
cut
out
everything
said
in
favour
of
journalists
and
working
men
and
everything
depreciating
clergymen
officers
wholesale
merchants
not
retail
the
professions
and
famous
writers
moreover
at
least
once
a
week
it
was
his
business
to
attack
the
management
of
the
royal
theatre
and
severely
criticize
the
frivolous
musical
comedies
produced
in
the
little
theatre
in
the
name
of
morality
and
public
decency
he
had
noticed
that
the
working
men
did
not
patronize
these
theatres
once
a
month
the
town
councillors
had
to
be
accused
of
extravagance
as
often
as
opportunity
arose
the
form
of
government
not
government
itself
had
to
be
assailed
the
editor
severely
censored
all
attacks
on
certain
members
of
parliament
and
ministers
which
that
was
a
mystery
unknown
to
even
the
editor
it
depended
on
a
combination
of
circumstances
which
only
the
secret
proprietor
of
the
paper
could
deal
with
falk
worked
with
his
scissors
until
one
of
his
hands
was
black
he
had
frequent
recourse
to
the
but
the
gum
smelt
sour
and
the
heat
in
the
room
was
stifling
the
poor
aloe
capable
of
enduring
thirst
like
a
camel
and
patiently
receiving
countless
stabs
from
an
irritated
increased
the
terrible
resemblance
to
a
desert
it
had
been
stabbed
until
it
was
covered
with
black
wounds
its
leaves
shot
like
a
bundle
of
donkeys
ears
out
of
the
parched
mould
falk
probably
had
a
vague
consciousness
of
something
of
this
sort
as
he
sat
plunged
in
thought
for
before
he
could
realize
what
he
was
doing
he
had
docked
off
all
the
ear
lobes
when
he
perceived
what
he
had
done
he
painted
the
wounds
with
gum
and
watched
it
drying
in
the
sun
he
vaguely
wondered
for
a
few
moments
how
he
was
to
get
dinner
for
he
had
strayed
on
to
that
path
which
leads
to
destruction
finally
he
lit
a
pipe
and
watched
the
soothing
smoke
rising
and
bathing
for
a
few
seconds
in
the
sunshine
it
made
him
feel
more
tolerant
of
poor
sweden
as
she
expressed
herself
in
these
daily
weekly
and
monthly
reports
called
the
press
he
put
the
scissors
aside
and
threw
the
papers
into
a
corner
he
shared
the
contents
of
the
earthen
with
the
aloe
the
miserable
object
looked
like
a
creature
whose
wings
had
been
clipped
a
spirit
standing
in
a
bog
on
its
head
digging
for
something
for
pearls
for
instance
or
at
any
rate
for
empty
shells
then
despair
like
a
tanner
seized
him
again
with
a
long
hook
and
pushed
him
down
into
the
vat
where
he
was
to
be
prepared
for
the
knife
which
should
scrape
his
skin
off
and
make
him
like
everybody
else
and
he
felt
no
remorse
no
regret
at
a
wasted
life
but
only
despair
at
having
to
die
in
his
youth
die
the
spiritual
death
before
he
had
had
an
opportunity
of
being
of
use
in
the
world
despair
that
he
was
being
cast
into
the
fire
as
a
useless
reed
the
clock
on
the
german
church
struck
eleven
and
the
chimes
began
to
play
oh
blessed
land
and
my
life
a
wave
as
if
seized
by
the
same
idea
an
italian
with
a
flute
accompaniment
began
to
play
the
blue
danube
so
much
music
put
new
life
into
the
tinsmith
below
who
began
hammering
his
with
redoubled
energy
the
din
and
uproar
prevented
falk
from
becoming
aware
of
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
entrance
of
two
men
one
of
them
had
a
tall
lean
figure
an
aquiline
nose
and
long
hair
the
other
one
was
short
blond
and
thick
set
his
perspiring
face
much
resembled
the
quadruped
which
the
hebrews
consider
more
unclean
than
any
other
their
outward
appearance
betrayed
an
occupation
requiring
neither
much
mental
nor
great
physical
strength
it
had
a
quality
of
vagueness
pointing
to
irregularity
of
work
and
habits
hsh
whispered
the
tall
man
are
you
alone
falk
was
partly
pleased
partly
annoyed
at
the
sight
of
his
visitors
quite
alone
the
red
one
left
town
has
he
come
along
then
and
have
some
dinner
falk
had
no
objection
he
locked
the
office
and
went
with
his
visitors
to
the
nearest
where
the
three
of
them
sat
down
in
the
darkest
corner
here
have
some
brandy
said
the
man
whose
glazed
eyes
sparkled
at
the
sight
of
the
brandy
bottle
but
falk
who
had
only
joined
his
friends
because
he
was
yearning
for
sympathy
and
comfort
paid
no
attention
to
the
proffered
delights
i
have
been
as
miserable
as
this
for
a
long
time
he
said
have
some
bread
and
butter
and
a
herring
said
the
tall
man
have
some
caraway
cheese
here
waiter
ca
you
advise
me
falk
began
again
i
ca
stand
the
red
one
any
longer
and
i
must
here
waiter
bring
some
black
bread
drink
falk
and
do
talk
nonsense
falk
was
thrown
out
of
the
saddle
he
made
no
second
attempt
to
find
sympathy
with
his
mental
difficulties
but
tried
another
not
unusual
way
your
advice
is
the
brandy
bottle
he
said
very
well
with
all
my
soul
then
the
alcohol
flowed
through
his
veins
like
poison
for
he
was
not
accustomed
to
take
strong
drink
in
the
morning
the
smell
of
cooking
the
buzzing
of
the
flies
the
odour
of
the
faded
flowers
which
stood
by
the
side
of
the
dirty
induced
in
him
a
strange
feeling
of
and
his
low
companions
with
their
neglected
linen
their
greasy
coats
and
their
unwashed
faces
harmonized
so
well
with
his
own
degraded
position
that
he
felt
a
wild
joy
surging
in
his
heart
we
were
in
the
deer
park
last
night
and
by
jove
we
did
drink
said
the
stout
man
once
more
enjoying
the
past
delights
in
memory
falk
had
no
answer
to
this
and
moreover
his
thoughts
were
running
in
a
different
groove
is
it
jolly
to
have
a
morning
off
said
the
tall
man
who
seemed
to
be
playing
the
part
of
tempter
it
is
indeed
replied
falk
trying
to
measure
his
freedom
as
it
were
with
a
glance
through
the
window
but
all
he
saw
was
a
and
a
in
a
yard
which
never
received
more
than
a
faint
reflexion
of
the
summer
sky
half
a
pint
that
it
ah
well
and
what
do
you
say
to
the
hahaha
do
laugh
said
falk
many
a
poor
devil
will
suffer
through
it
who
are
the
poor
devils
poor
capitalists
are
you
sorry
for
those
who
do
work
but
live
on
the
proceeds
of
their
money
no
my
boy
you
are
still
full
of
prejudices
there
was
a
funny
tale
in
the
about
a
wholesale
merchant
who
bequeathed
to
the
crèche
bethlehem
twenty
thousand
crowns
and
was
given
the
order
of
vasa
for
his
munificence
now
it
has
transpired
that
the
bequest
was
in
shares
with
joint
liability
and
so
the
crèche
is
of
course
bankrupt
is
that
lovely
the
assets
were
cradles
and
an
oil
painting
by
an
unknown
master
it
too
funny
the
portrait
was
valued
at
five
crowns
hahahaha
the
subject
of
conversation
irritated
falk
for
he
knew
more
of
the
matter
than
the
two
others
did
you
see
that
the
unmasked
that
humbug
schönström
who
published
that
volume
of
miserable
verses
at
christmas
said
the
stout
man
it
really
was
a
rare
pleasure
to
learn
the
truth
about
the
rascal
i
have
more
than
once
given
him
a
sound
slating
in
the
but
you
were
rather
unjust
his
verses
were
not
as
bad
as
you
said
remarked
the
tall
man
not
as
bad
they
were
worse
than
mine
which
the
tore
to
shreds
do
you
remember
falk
have
you
been
to
the
theatre
in
the
deer
park
asked
the
tall
man
no
what
a
pity
that
lundholm
gang
of
thieves
is
playing
there
impudent
fellow
the
director
he
sent
no
seats
to
the
and
when
we
arrived
at
the
theatre
last
night
he
turned
us
out
but
he
pay
for
it
you
give
it
to
the
dog
here
paper
and
pencil
heading
and
music
deer
park
theatre
now
you
go
on
but
i
have
seen
the
company
what
does
that
matter
have
you
never
written
about
anything
you
had
seen
no
i
unmasked
humbugs
but
i
have
never
attacked
unoffending
people
and
i
know
nothing
about
this
company
they
are
a
miserable
lot
just
scum
affirmed
the
stout
man
sharpen
your
pen
and
bruise
his
heel
you
are
splendid
at
it
why
do
you
bruise
him
yourselves
because
the
printers
know
our
handwriting
and
some
of
them
walk
on
in
the
crowds
moreover
lundholm
is
a
violent
fellow
he
will
be
sure
to
invade
the
editorial
office
then
it
will
be
a
good
thing
to
be
able
to
tell
him
that
the
criticism
is
a
communication
from
the
public
and
while
you
write
up
the
stage
i
will
do
the
concerts
there
was
a
sacred
concert
last
week
was
the
man
name
daubry
with
a
no
with
an
corrected
the
fat
man
do
forget
that
he
a
tenor
and
sang
the
mater
how
do
you
spell
it
i
tell
you
in
a
minute
the
stout
editor
of
the
took
a
packet
of
greasy
newspapers
from
the
here
the
whole
programme
and
i
believe
a
criticism
as
well
falk
could
not
help
laughing
how
could
a
criticism
appear
simultaneously
with
the
advertisement
why
should
it
but
we
sha
want
it
i
will
criticize
that
french
mob
myself
you
better
do
the
literature
fatty
do
the
publishers
send
books
to
the
asked
falk
are
you
mad
do
you
buy
them
yourselves
for
the
sake
of
reviewing
them
buy
them
greenhorn
have
another
glass
and
cheer
up
and
i
treat
you
to
a
chop
do
you
read
the
books
which
you
review
who
do
you
think
has
time
for
reading
books
is
it
enough
to
write
about
them
it
quite
sufficient
to
read
the
papers
moreover
our
principle
to
slate
everything
an
absurd
principle
not
at
all
it
brings
all
the
author
enemies
and
enviers
on
side
and
so
one
in
the
majority
those
who
are
neutral
would
rather
see
an
author
slated
than
praised
to
the
nobody
there
is
something
edifying
and
comforting
in
the
knowledge
that
the
road
to
fame
is
beset
with
thorns
do
you
think
so
you
may
be
right
but
the
idea
of
playing
with
human
destinies
in
this
way
is
terrible
oh
it
good
for
young
and
old
i
know
that
for
i
was
persistently
slated
in
my
young
days
but
you
mislead
public
opinion
the
public
does
not
want
to
have
an
opinion
it
wants
to
satisfy
its
passions
if
i
praise
your
enemy
you
writhe
like
a
worm
and
tell
me
that
i
have
no
judgment
if
i
praise
your
friend
you
tell
me
that
i
have
take
that
last
piece
of
the
dramatic
theatre
fatty
which
has
just
been
published
in
book
form
are
you
sure
that
it
has
been
published
i
am
certain
of
it
it
quite
safe
to
say
that
there
is
enough
action
in
it
that
a
phrase
the
public
knows
well
laugh
a
little
at
the
language
that
good
old
disparaging
praise
then
attack
the
management
for
having
accepted
such
a
play
and
point
out
that
the
moral
teaching
is
doubtful
a
very
safe
thing
to
say
about
most
things
but
as
you
have
seen
the
performance
say
that
want
of
room
compels
us
to
postpone
our
criticism
of
the
acting
do
that
and
you
ca
make
a
mistake
who
is
the
unfortunate
author
asked
falk
nobody
knows
think
of
his
parents
his
friends
who
will
read
your
possibly
quite
unjust
remarks
what
that
got
to
do
with
the
they
were
hoping
to
see
a
friend
slated
they
know
what
to
expect
from
the
have
you
no
conscience
has
the
public
which
supports
us
a
conscience
do
you
think
we
could
survive
if
it
did
not
support
us
would
you
like
to
hear
a
paragraph
which
i
wrote
on
the
present
state
of
literature
i
can
assure
you
it
will
give
you
plenty
to
think
about
i
have
a
copy
with
me
but
let
us
have
some
stout
first
waiter
here
now
i
going
to
give
you
a
treat
you
can
profit
by
it
if
you
like
have
not
heard
so
much
whining
in
the
swedish
for
many
years
this
constant
puling
is
enough
to
drive
a
man
into
a
lunatic
asylum
robust
rascals
caterwaul
like
cats
in
march
they
imagine
that
anæmia
and
adenoids
will
arouse
public
interest
now
that
consumption
is
played
out
and
withal
they
have
backs
broad
as
horses
and
faces
red
as
tapsters
this
one
whimpers
about
the
infidelity
of
women
although
all
he
has
to
go
on
is
the
bought
loyalty
of
a
wanton
that
one
tells
us
that
he
has
no
gold
but
that
his
harp
is
all
he
possesses
in
the
world
the
liar
he
has
five
thousand
crowns
dividend
per
annum
and
the
right
to
an
endowed
chair
in
the
swedish
academy
a
third
is
a
faithless
cynical
scoffer
who
can
not
open
his
lips
without
breathing
forth
his
impure
spirit
and
babbling
blasphemies
their
verses
are
not
a
whit
better
than
those
which
thirty
years
ago
clergymen
daughters
sang
to
the
guitar
they
should
write
for
confectioners
at
a
penny
a
line
and
not
waste
the
time
of
publishers
printers
and
reviewers
with
their
rhymes
what
do
they
write
about
about
nothing
at
all
that
is
to
say
about
themselves
it
is
bad
form
to
talk
about
oneself
but
it
is
quite
the
right
thing
to
write
about
oneself
what
are
they
bemoaning
their
incapacity
to
achieve
a
success
success
that
is
the
word
have
they
produced
one
single
thought
capable
of
benefiting
their
the
age
in
which
they
live
if
they
had
but
once
championed
the
cause
of
the
helpless
their
sins
might
be
forgiven
them
but
they
have
not
therefore
they
are
as
sounding
brass
nay
they
are
as
a
clanking
piece
of
tin
and
the
cracked
bell
of
a
fool
cap
for
they
have
no
other
love
than
the
love
of
the
next
edition
of
their
books
the
love
of
the
academy
and
the
love
of
themselves
that
sarcasm
is
it
what
it
unjust
said
falk
i
find
it
very
impressive
said
the
stout
man
you
ca
deny
that
it
is
well
written
can
you
he
wields
a
pen
which
pierces
now
lads
stop
talking
and
write
afterwards
you
shall
have
coffee
and
liqueurs
and
they
wrote
of
human
merit
and
human
unworthiness
and
broke
hearts
as
if
they
were
breaking
falk
felt
an
indescribable
longing
for
fresh
air
he
opened
the
window
which
looked
on
the
yard
it
was
dark
and
narrow
like
a
tomb
all
he
could
see
was
a
small
square
of
the
sky
if
he
bent
his
head
far
back
he
fancied
that
he
was
sitting
in
his
grave
breathing
brandy
fumes
and
kitchen
smells
eating
the
funeral
repast
at
the
burial
of
his
youth
his
principles
and
his
honour
he
smelt
the
which
stood
on
the
table
but
they
reeked
of
decay
once
more
he
looked
out
of
the
window
eager
to
find
an
object
which
would
not
inspire
him
with
loathing
but
there
was
nothing
but
a
newly
tarred
standing
like
a
coffin
with
its
contents
of
finery
and
broken
litter
his
thoughts
climbed
up
the
which
seemed
to
lead
from
dirt
stench
and
shame
right
up
into
the
blue
sky
but
no
angels
were
ascending
and
descending
and
no
love
was
watching
from
above
there
was
nothing
but
the
empty
blue
void
falk
took
his
pen
and
began
to
shade
the
letters
of
the
headline
theatre
when
a
strong
hand
clutched
his
arm
and
a
firm
voice
said
come
along
i
want
to
speak
to
you
he
looked
up
taken
back
and
ashamed
borg
stood
beside
him
apparently
determined
not
to
let
him
go
may
i
introduce
began
falk
no
you
may
not
interrupted
borg
i
do
want
to
know
any
drunken
scribblers
come
along
he
drew
falk
to
the
door
where
your
hat
oh
here
it
is
come
along
they
were
in
the
street
borg
took
his
arm
led
him
to
the
nearest
square
marched
him
into
a
shop
and
bought
him
a
pair
of
canvas
shoes
this
done
he
drew
him
across
the
lock
to
the
harbour
a
cutter
lay
there
fast
to
her
moorings
but
ready
to
go
to
sea
in
the
cutter
sat
young
levi
reading
a
latin
grammar
and
munching
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
this
said
borg
is
the
cutter
it
an
ugly
name
but
she
is
a
good
boat
and
she
is
insured
in
the
there
sits
her
owner
the
hebrew
lad
isaac
reading
a
latin
grammar
the
idiot

this
moment

up
we
will
divide
it
equally
amongst
us
please
send
me
my
share
by
steamer
to
dalarö
where
i
will
call
for
it
i
have
now
had
falk
under
treatment
for
a
month
and
i
believe
he
is
on
the
road
to
recovery
you
will
remember
that
after
olle
famous
lecture
he
left
us
abruptly
and
instead
of
making
use
of
his
brother
and
his
brother
connexions
went
on
the
staff
of
the
where
he
was
for
fifty
crowns
a
month
but
the
wind
of
freedom
which
blew
there
must
have
had
a
demoralizing
effect
on
him
for
he
became
morose
and
neglected
his
appearance
with
the
help
of
the
girl
beda
i
kept
my
eye
on
him
and
when
i
considered
him
ripe
for
a
rupture
with
the
communards
i
went
and
fetched
him
away
i
found
him
in
a
low
called
the
star
in
the
company
of
two
scandal
writers
with
whom
he
was
drinking
brandy
i
believe
they
were
writing
at
the
same
time
he
was
in
a
melancholy
condition
as
you
would
say
as
you
know
i
regard
mankind
with
calm
indifference
men
are
to
me
geological
preparations
minerals
some
crystallize
under
one
condition
others
under
another
it
all
depends
on
certain
laws
or
circumstances
which
should
leave
us
completely
unmoved
i
do
weep
over
the
because
it
is
not
as
hard
as
a
therefore
i
can
not
regard
falk
condition
as
melancholy
it
was
the
outcome
of
his
temperament
heart
you
would
say
plus
the
circumstances
which
his
temperament
had
created
but
he
was
certainly
down
when
i
found
him
i
took
him
on
board
our
cutter
and
he
remained
passive
but
just
as
we
had
pushed
off
he
turned
round
and
saw
beda
standing
on
the
shore
beckoning
to
him
i
ca
think
how
she
got
there
on
seeing
her
our
man
went
clear
out
of
his
mind
put
me
ashore
he
screamed
threatening
to
jump
overboard
i
seized
him
by
the
arms
pushed
him
into
the
cabin
and
locked
the
door
as
we
passed
vaxholm
i
posted
two
letters
one
to
the
editor
of
the
begging
him
to
excuse
falk
absence
and
the
other
to
his
landlady
asking
her
to
send
him
his
clothes
in
the
meantime
he
had
calmed
down
and
when
he
beheld
the
sea
and
the
skerries
he
became
sentimental
and
talked
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
he
had
lost
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
god
green
earth
again
he
said
and
so
on
but
presently
he
began
to
suffer
from
something
like
qualms
of
conscience
he
maintained
that
he
had
no
right
to
be
happy
and
take
a
holiday
when
there
were
so
many
unhappy
people
in
the
world
he
imagined
that
he
was
neglecting
his
duty
towards
the
scoundrel
who
edits
the
and
begged
us
to
row
him
back
when
i
talked
to
him
of
the
terrible
time
he
had
just
gone
through
he
replied
that
it
was
the
duty
of
all
men
to
work
and
suffer
for
one
another
this
view
had
almost
become
a
religion
with
him
but
i
have
cured
him
of
it
with
soda
water
and
salt
baths
he
was
completely
broken
and
i
had
great
difficulty
in
patching
him
up
for
it
was
hard
to
say
where
the
physical
trouble
ended
and
the
psychical
began
i
must
say
that
in
a
certain
respect
he
excites
my
astonishment
i
wo
say
admiration
for
i
never
admire
anybody
he
seems
to
suffer
from
an
extraordinary
mania
which
makes
him
act
in
direct
contradiction
to
his
own
interest
he
might
have
been
in
a
splendid
position
if
he
had
not
thrown
up
his
career
in
the
civil
service
particularly
as
his
brother
would
in
that
case
have
helped
him
with
a
sum
of
money
instead
of
that
he
cast
his
reputation
to
the
winds
and
slaved
for
a
brutal
plebeian
and
all
for
the
sake
of
his
ideals
it
is
most
extraordinary
but
he
seems
to
be
mending
at
last
more
particularly
after
a
lesson
he
had
here
can
you
believe
it
he
called
the
fishermen
sir
and
took
off
his
hat
to
them
in
addition
he
indulged
in
cordial
chats
with
the
natives
in
order
to
find
out
how
these
people
lived
the
result
was
that
the
fishermen
pricked
up
their
ears
and
one
of
them
asked
me
one
day
whether
this
falk
paid
for
his
own
board
or
whether
the
doctor
i
paid
for
him
i
told
falk
about
it
and
it
depressed
him
he
is
always
despondent
whenever
he
is
robbed
of
a
delusion
a
few
days
later
he
talked
to
our
landlord
on
the
subject
of
universal
suffrage
later
on
our
landlord
asked
me
whether
falk
was
in
poor
circumstances
during
the
first
few
days
he
ran
up
and
down
the
shore
like
a
madman
often
he
swam
far
out
into
the
fjörd
as
if
he
never
meant
to
return
again
as
i
always
looked
upon
suicide
as
the
sacred
right
of
every
individual
i
did
not
interfere
isaac
told
me
that
falk
had
opened
his
heart
to
him
on
the
subject
of
the
girl
beda
she
seems
to
have
made
an
awful
fool
of
him
a
propos
of
isaac
he
is
one
of
the
shrewdest
fellows
i
ever
met
he
has
after
one
month
study
mastered
the
latin
grammar
and
he
reads
his
cæsar
as
we
read
the
and
what
more
he
knows
all
about
it
which
we
never
did
his
brain
is
receptive
that
is
to
say
capable
of
assimilating
knowledge
and
in
addition
to
this
it
is
practical
this
combination
has
produced
many
a
genius
in
spite
of
gross
stupidity
in
many
other
respects
every
now
and
then
he
indulges
his
business
instincts
the
other
day
he
gave
us
a
brilliant
example
of
his
talent
in
that
direction
i
know
nothing
about
his
financial
position
for
in
that
respect
he
is
very
reticent
but
a
little
while
ago
he
had
to
pay
a
few
hundred
crowns
he
was
very
fidgety
and
as
he
did
not
want
to
apply
to
his
brother
of
the
triton
with
whom
he
is
not
on
friendly
terms
he
asked
me
to
lend
him
the
sum
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
do
so
thereupon
he
sat
down
took
a
sheet
of
wrote
a
letter
and
sent
it
off
by
special
messenger
for
a
few
days
nothing
happened
in
front
of
our
cottage
grew
a
pretty
little
oakwood
which
shaded
us
from
the
sun
and
sheltered
us
from
the
strong
sea
breezes
i
do
know
much
about
trees
and
things
pertaining
to
nature
but
i
love
to
sit
in
the
shade
when
the
days
are
hot
one
morning
on
pulling
up
my
blind
i
was
dumbfounded
i
was
looking
at
the
open
fjörd
and
a
yacht
riding
at
anchor
about
a
from
the
shore
every
tree
had
gone
and
isaac
was
sitting
on
a
stump
reading
euclid
and
counting
the
trunks
as
they
were
being
carried
on
board
the
yacht
i
wakened
falk
he
was
furious
and
had
a
quarrel
with
isaac
who
made
a
thousand
crowns
on
the
deal
our
landlord
received
two
hundred
all
he
had
asked
for
i
could
have
killed
isaac
not
because
he
had
had
the
trees
cut
down
but
because
i
had
not
thought
of
it
first
falk
said
it
was
unpatriotic
but
isaac
swears
that
the
removal
of
the
rubbish
has
improved
the
view
he
declares
that
he
will
take
a
boat
next
week
and
visit
the
neighbouring
islets
with
the
same
object
our
landlord
wife
cried
all
day
long
but
her
husband
went
to
dalarö
to
buy
her
a
new
dress
he
remained
away
for
two
whole
days
and
when
he
returned
at
last
he
was
drunk
there
was
nothing
in
the
boat
and
when
his
wife
asked
for
the
new
dress
the
fisherman
confessed
that
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
enough
for
the
present
write
soon
and
tell
me
a
few
new
scandals
and
be
careful
how
you
manipulate
the
loan
your
deadly
enemy
and
security
i
read
in

a

bank

about
to
be
established

going
to

can
place

affect

one

research
on

near

discovered
a
new
species
of
the
family
clypeaster
to
which
he
has
given
the
very
pertinent
name
of
its
characteristics
may
be
described
as

for

falk
is
well
he
has
passed
the
crisis
like
a
man
he
has
regained
his
a
most
important
quality
as
far
as
worldly
success
goes
but
a
quality
which
according
to
statistics
is
considerably
weakened
in
children
who
lose
their
mothers
at
an
early
age
i
gave
him
a
prescription
which
he
promised
to
try
all
the
more
readily
as
the
same
idea
had
occurred
to
him
he
will
return
to
his
former
profession
but
without
accepting
his
brother
help
his
last
act
of
folly
of
which
i
do
not
approve
society
register
his
name
with
the
rest
of
the
cattle
become
respectable
make
himself
a
social
position
and
hold
his
tongue
until
his
word
bears
weight
the
latter
is
absolutely
necessary
if
he
is
to
remain
alive
he
has
a
tendency
to
insanity
and
is
bound
to
lose
his
reason
unless
he
forgets
all
about
these
ideas
which
i
really
can
not
understand
and
i
believe
that
he
himself
could
define
what
it
is
he
wants
he
has
begun
the
cure
and
i
am
amazed
at
his
progress
i
sure
end
as
a
member
of
the
royal
household
that
is
what
i
believed
until
a
few
days
ago
when
he
read
in
a
paper
an
account
of
the
commune
at
paris
he
at
once
had
a
relapse
and
took
to
climbing
trees
again
he
got
over
it
though
and
now
he
does
not
dare
to
look
at
a
paper
but
he
never
says
a
word
beware
of
the
man
when
his
apprenticeship
is
over
isaac
is
now
learning
greek
he
considers
the
too
stupid
and
too
long
therefore
he
takes
them
to
pieces
cuts
out
the
most
important
bits
and
pastes
them
into
an
account
book
which
he
has
arranged
like
a
summary
for
his
forthcoming
examinations
unfortunately
his
increasing
knowledge
of
the
classics
makes
him
impudent
and
disagreeable
so
for
instance
he
dared
to
contradict
the
pastor
the
other
day
while
playing
a
game
of
draughts
with
him
and
maintain
that
the
jews
had
invented
christianity
and
that
all
those
baptized
were
really
jews
latin
and
greek
have
ruined
him
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
nursed
a

in

this
is
so

again
from
nämdö
we
are
returning
to
town
on
monday
chapter
xxvii
recovery
it
was
autumn
again
on
a
clear
november
morning
arvid
falk
was
walking
from
his
elegantly
furnished
rooms
in
great
street
to
boarding
school
near
charles
xii
market
where
he
had
an
appointment
as
master
of
the
swedish
language
and
history
during
the
autumn
months
he
had
made
his
way
back
into
civilized
society
a
proceeding
which
had
brought
home
to
him
the
fact
that
he
had
become
a
perfect
savage
during
his
wanderings
he
had
discarded
his
disreputable
hat
and
bought
a
high
one
which
he
found
difficult
at
first
to
keep
on
his
head
he
had
bought
gloves
but
in
his
savagery
he
had
replied
fifteen
when
the
shopgirl
asked
for
his
size
and
blushed
when
his
reply
brought
a
smile
to
the
face
of
every
girl
in
the
shop
the
fashion
had
changed
since
he
had
last
bought
clothes
as
he
was
walking
through
the
streets
he
looked
upon
himself
as
a
dandy
and
every
now
and
then
examined
his
reflexion
in
the
shop
windows
to
see
whether
his
garments
set
well
now
he
was
strolling
up
and
down
the
pavement
before
the
dramatic
theatre
and
waiting
for
the
clock
on
james
church
to
strike
nine
he
felt
uneasy
and
embarrassed
as
if
he
were
a
schoolboy
going
to
school
himself
the
pavement
was
so
short
and
as
again
and
again
he
retraced
his
footsteps
he
compared
himself
to
a
dog
on
a
chain
for
a
moment
he
had
a
wild
thought
of
taking
a
wider
range
a
very
much
wider
range
for
if
he
went
straight
on
he
would
come
to
and
he
remembered
the
spring
morning
when
that
very
pavement
had
led
him
away
from
society
which
he
detested
into
liberty
nature
and
slavery
it
struck
nine
he
stood
in
the
corridor
the
schoolroom
doors
were
closed
in
the
twilight
he
saw
a
long
row
of
children
garments
hanging
against
the
wall
hats
boas
bonnets
wraps
gloves
and
muffs
were
lying
on
tables
and
window
sills
and
whole
regiments
of
button
boots
and
overshoes
stood
on
the
floor
but
there
was
no
smell
of
damp
clothes
and
wet
leather
as
in
the
halls
of
the
parliamentary
buildings
and
in
the
union
phoenix
or
he
became
conscious
of
a
faint
odour
of
newly
mown
hay
it
seemed
to
come
from
a
little
muff
lined
with
blue
silk
and
trimmed
with
tassels
which
looked
like
a
white
kitten
with
black
dots
he
could
not
resist
taking
it
in
his
hand
and
smelling
the
perfume
hay
when
the
front
door
opened
and
a
little
girl
of
about
ten
came
in
accompanied
by
a
maid
she
looked
at
the
master
with
big
fearless
eyes
and
dropped
a
coquettish
little
curtsey
the
almost
embarrassed
master
replied
with
a
bow
which
made
the
little
beauty
smile
and
the
maid
too
she
was
late
but
she
was
quite
unconcerned
and
allowed
her
maid
to
take
off
her
outdoor
garments
and
overshoes
as
calmly
as
if
she
had
come
to
a
dance
from
the
came
a
sound
which
made
his
heart
beat
what
was
it
ah
the
organ
the
old
organ
a
legion
of
children
voices
were
singing
jesus
at
the
day
beginning
he
felt
ill
at
ease
and
forced
himself
to
fix
his
mind
on
borg
and
isaac
in
order
to
control
his
feelings
but
matters
went
from
bad
to
worse
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
the
old
prayer
it
was
long
ago
the
silence
was
so
profound
that
he
could
hear
the
raising
of
all
the
little
heads
and
the
rustling
of
collars
and
pinafores
the
doors
were
thrown
open
he
looked
at
a
huge
moving
composed
of
little
girls
between
eight
and
fourteen
he
felt
like
a
thief
caught
in
the
act
when
the
old
headmistress
shook
hands
with
him
the
flowers
waved
to
and
fro
and
there
was
much
excited
whispering
and
exchanging
of
significant
glances
he
sat
down
at
the
end
of
a
long
table
surrounded
by
twenty
fresh
faces
with
sparkling
eyes
twenty
children
who
had
never
experienced
the
bitterest
of
all
sorrows
the
humiliations
of
poverty
they
met
his
glance
boldly
and
inquisitively
but
he
was
embarrassed
and
had
to
pull
himself
together
with
an
effort
before
long
however
he
was
on
friendly
terms
with
anna
and
charlotte
georgina
and
lizzy
and
harry
teaching
was
a
pleasure
he
made
allowances
and
let
louis
xiv
and
alexander
be
termed
great
men
like
all
others
who
had
been
successful
he
permitted
the
french
revolution
to
be
called
a
terrible
event
during
which
the
noble
louis
xvi
and
the
virtuous
marie
antoinette
perished
miserably
and
so
on
when
he
entered
the
office
of
the
board
of
purveyance
of
hay
for
the
cavalry
regiments
he
felt
young
and
refreshed
he
stayed
till
eleven
reading
the
then
he
went
to
the
offices
of
the
committee
on
brandy
distilleries
lunched
and
wrote
two
letters
one
to
borg
and
one
to
struve
on
the
stroke
of
one
he
was
in
the
department
for
death
duties
here
he
collated
an
assessment
of
property
which
brought
him
in
a
hundred
crowns
he
had
time
enough
before
dinner
to
read
the
proofs
of
the
revised
edition
of
the
forest
laws
which
he
was
editing
it
struck
three
anybody
crossing
the
riddarhus
market
at
that
time
could
have
met
on
the
bridge
a
young
man
with
pockets
bulging
with
manuscripts
and
hands
crossed
on
his
back
he
is
strolling
slowly
along
accompanied
by
an
elderly
lean
man
of
fifty
the
actuary
of
the
dead
the
estate
of
every
citizen
who
dies
has
to
be
declared
to
him
according
to
the
amount
he
takes
his
percentage
some
say
that
this
is
his
duty
others
that
he
represents
the
earth
and
has
to
watch
that
the
dead
take
nothing
away
with
them
as
everything
is
a
loan
without
interest
in
any
case
he
is
a
man
more
interested
in
the
dead
than
the
living
and
therefore
falk
likes
his
company
he
on
the
other
hand
is
attached
to
falk
because
like
himself
he
collects
coins
and
autographs
and
because
he
possesses
that
excellent
quality
tolerance
which
is
rarely
found
in
a
young
man
the
two
friends
enter
the
restaurant
rosengren
where
they
are
fairly
certain
not
to
meet
young
men
and
where
they
can
discuss
numismatics
and
autography
they
take
their
coffee
in
the
café
rydberg
and
look
at
catalogues
of
coins
until
six
at
six
the
official
appears
and
they
read
the
promotions
each
enjoys
the
other
company
for
they
never
quarrel
falk
is
so
free
from
fixed
opinions
that
he
is
the
most
amiable
man
in
the
world
liked
and
appreciated
by
chiefs
and
colleagues
occasionally
they
dine
in
the
hamburg
exchange
and
take
a
liqueur
or
two
at
the
opera
restaurant
and
to
see
them
walking
along
arm
in
arm
at
eleven
is
really
quite
an
edifying
sight
moreover
falk
has
become
a
regular
guest
at
family
dinners
and
suppers
in
houses
into
which
borg
father
has
introduced
him
the
women
find
him
interesting
although
they
do
not
know
how
to
take
him
he
is
always
smiling
and
expert
at
sarcastic
little
pleasantries
but
when
he
is
sick
of
family
life
and
the
social
life
he
visits
the
red
room
and
there
he
meets
the
redoubtable
borg
his
admirer
isaac
his
secret
enemy
and
envier
struve
the
man
who
never
has
any
money
and
the
sarcastic
sellén
who
is
gradually
preparing
his
second
success
after
all
his
imitators
have
accustomed
the
public
to
his
manner
lundell
who
after
the
completion
of
his
gave
up
painting
sacred
pictures
and
became
a
fat
epicurean
only
comes
to
the
red
room
when
he
has
no
money
to
pay
for
his
dinner
he
makes
a
living
by
portrait
painting
a
profession
which
brings
him
countless
invitations
to
dinners
and
suppers
lundell
maintains
that
these
invitations
are
essential
for
making
character
studies
olle
who
is
still
employed
by
the
stonemason
has
become
a
gloomy
misanthrope
after
his
great
failure
as
a
politician
and
orator
he
refuses
to
impose
on
his
former
friends
and
lives
a
solitary
life
falk
is
in
a
boisterous
riotous
mood
whenever
he
visits
the
red
room
and
borg
is
of
opinion
that
he
does
him
credit
he
is
a
veritable
to
whom
nothing
is
sacred
except
politics
this
is
a
subject
on
which
he
never
touches
but
if
while
he
lets
off
his
fireworks
for
the
amusement
of
his
friends
he
should
catch
through
the
dense
tobacco
smoke
a
glimpse
of
the
morose
olle
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
his
mood
changes
he
becomes
gloomy
like
a
night
on
the
sea
and
swallows
large
quantities
of
strong
liquor
as
if
he
wanted
to
extinguish
a
smouldering
fire
but
olle
has
not
been
seen
for
a
long
time
chapter
xxviii
from
beyond
the
grave
the
snow
was
falling
lightly
and
silently
clothing
the
street
in
pure
white
as
falk
and
sellén
were
walking
to
the
infirmary
in
the
suburb
of
kingsholm
to
call
for
borg
on
their
way
to
the
red
room
it
strange
that
the
first
snow
should
create
an
almost
solemn
impression
said
sellén
the
dirty
ground
is
transformed
to
are
you
sentimental
scoffed
falk
oh
no
i
was
merely
talking
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
landscape
painter
they
continued
their
way
in
silence
wading
through
the
whirling
snow
the
kingsholm
with
its
infirmaries
always
strikes
me
as
uncanny
remarked
falk
after
a
pause
are
you
sentimental
scoffed
sellén
not
at
all
but
this
part
of
the
town
always
makes
that
impression
on
me
nonsense
it
does
make
any
impression
at
all
you
imagine
it
does
here
we
are
and
borg
windows
are
lit
up
perhaps
he
got
some
nice
corpses
they
were
standing
before
the
door
of
the
institute
the
huge
building
with
its
many
dark
windows
glared
at
them
as
if
it
were
inquiring
what
they
wanted
at
that
hour
of
the
night
they
passed
the
round
flower
bed
and
entered
the
small
building
on
the
right
at
the
very
back
of
the
room
borg
was
sitting
alone
in
the
lamplight
working
at
the
mutilated
body
of
a
man
who
had
hanged
himself
good
evening
said
borg
laying
aside
his
knife
would
you
like
to
see
an
old
friend
he
did
not
wait
for
the
answer
which
was
not
forthcoming
but
lighted
a
lantern
took
his
overcoat
and
a
bunch
of
keys
i
did
know
that
we
had
any
friends
here
said
sellén
desperately
clinging
to
a
flippant
mood
come
along
said
borg
they
crossed
the
yard
and
entered
the
large
building
the
creaking
door
closed
behind
them
and
the
little
piece
of
candle
a
remnant
from
the
last
card
party
threw
its
red
feeble
glimmer
on
the
white
walls
the
two
strangers
tried
to
read
borg
face
wondering
whether
he
was
up
to
some
trick
but
the
face
was
inscrutable
they
turned
to
the
left
and
went
along
a
passage
which
echoed
to
their
footsteps
in
a
way
which
suggested
that
they
were
being
followed
falk
kept
close
behind
borg
and
tried
to
keep
sellén
at
his
back
over
there
said
borg
standing
still
in
the
middle
of
the
passage
nobody
could
see
anything
but
walls
but
they
heard
a
low
trickling
sound
like
the
falling
of
a
gentle
rain
and
became
aware
of
a
strange
odour
resembling
the
smell
of
a
damp
or
a
in
october
to
the
right
said
borg
the
right
wall
was
made
of
glass
and
behind
it
on
their
backs
lay
three
white
bodies
borg
selected
a
key
opened
the
glass
door
and
entered
here
he
said
standing
still
before
the
second
of
the
three
it
was
olle
he
lay
there
as
quietly
with
his
hands
folded
across
his
chest
as
if
he
were
taking
an
afternoon
nap
his
lips
created
the
impression
that
he
was
smiling
he
was
drowned
asked
sellén
who
was
the
first
to
regain
his
drowned
echoed
borg
can
either
of
you
identify
his
clothes
three
miserable
suits
were
hanging
against
the
wall
sellén
at
once
picked
out
the
right
one
a
blue
jacket
with
sporting
buttons
and
a
pair
of
black
trousers
rubbed
white
at
the
knees
are
you
certain
ought
to
know
my
own
coat
which
i
borrowed
from
falk
sellén
drew
a
from
the
breast
pocket
of
the
jacket
it
was
saturated
with
water
and
covered
with
green
algæ
which
borg
called
enteromorph
he
opened
it
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
and
examined
its
contents
two
or
three
overdue
and
a
bundle
of
papers
tied
together
on
which
was
written
to
him
who
cares
to
read
have
you
seen
enough
asked
borg
then
let
go
and
have
a
drink
the
three
mourners
friend
was
a
word
only
used
by
levin
and
lundell
when
they
wanted
to
borrow
money
went
to
the
nearest
as
representatives
of
the
red
room
beside
a
blazing
fire
and
behind
a
battery
of
bottles
borg
began
the
perusal
of
the
papers
which
olle
had
left
behind
but
more
than
once
he
had
to
have
recourse
to
falk
skill
as
an
autographer
for
the
water
had
washed
away
the
words
here
and
there
it
looked
as
if
the
tears
had
fallen
on
the
sheets
as
sellén
facetiously
remarked
stop
talking
now
said
borg
emptying
his
glass
of
grog
with
a
grimace
which
exhibited
all
his
back
teeth
i
am
going
to
read
and
i
beg
of
you
not
to
interrupt
me
him
who
cares
to
read
have
a
right
to
take
my
life
all
the
more
so
because
not
only
does
my
act
not
interfere
with
the
interests
of
a
but
rather
it
contributes
to
the
happiness
as
it
is
called
of
at
least
one
person
a
place
and
four
hundred
cubic
feet
of
air
will
become
vacant
motive
is
not
despair
for
an
intelligent
individual
never
despairs
but
i
take
this
step
with
a
fairly
calm
conscience
that
an
act
of
this
kind
throws
one
mind
into
a
certain
state
of
excitement
will
be
easily
understood
by
everybody
to
postpone
it
from
fear
of
what
might
come
hereafter
is
only
worthy
of
a
slave
clutching
at
any
excuse
so
that
he
might
stay
in
a
world
where
he
can
not
have
suffered
much
at
the
thought
of
going
a
burden
seems
to
fall
from
my
shoulders
i
can
not
fare
worse
i
might
fare
better
if
there
is
no
life
beyond
the
grave
death
must
be
happiness
as
great
a
happiness
at
least
as
sleep
in
a
soft
bed
after
hard
physical
labour
nobody
who
has
ever
observed
how
sleep
relaxes
every
muscle
and
how
the
soul
gradually
steals
away
can
fear
death
does
humanity
make
so
much
ado
about
death
because
it
has
burrowed
so
deeply
into
the
earth
that
a
tearing
away
from
it
is
bound
to
be
painful
i
put
off
from
the
shore
long
ago
i
have
no
family
bonds
no
social
national
or
legal
ties
which
could
hold
me
back
and
i
going
simply
because
life
has
no
longer
any
attraction
for
me
do
not
want
to
encourage
those
who
are
well
content
to
follow
my
example
they
have
no
reason
to
do
so
and
therefore
they
can
not
judge
my
act
i
have
not
considered
the
point
whether
it
is
cowardly
or
not
to
that
aspect
of
the
question
i
am
indifferent
moreover
it
is
a
private
matter
i
never
asked
to
come
here
and
therefore
i
have
a
right
to
go
when
i
please
reason
for
going
there
are
so
many
reasons
and
they
are
so
complicated
that
i
have
neither
the
time
nor
the
ability
to
explain
them
i
will
only
mention
the
most
obvious
those
which
had
the
greatest
influence
on
myself
and
on
my
act
childhood
and
youth
were
one
long
continuation
of
manual
labour
you
who
do
not
know
what
it
means
to
labour
from
sunrise
to
sunset
only
to
fall
into
a
heavy
sleep
when
the
toil
is
over
you
have
escaped
the
curse
of
the
fall
for
it
is
a
curse
to
feel
one
spiritual
growth
arrested
while
one
body
sinks
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
earth
a
man
who
walks
behind
the
ploughing
cattle
day
in
day
out
and
sees
nothing
but
the
grey
clouds
will
end
by
forgetting
the
blue
sky
above
his
head
a
man
who
takes
a
spade
and
digs
a
hole
while
the
sun
scorches
his
skin
will
feel
that
he
is
sinking
into
the
parched
ground
and
digging
a
grave
for
his
soul
you
know
nothing
of
this
you
who
play
all
day
long
and
work
a
little
only
during
an
idle
hour
between
luncheon
and
dinner
you
who
rest
your
spirit
when
the
earth
is
green
and
enjoy
nature
as
an
ennobling
and
elevating
spectacle
the
toiler
on
the
land
never
sees
the
spirit
of
nature
to
him
the
field
is
bread
the
forest
timber
the
sea
a
the
meadow
cheese
and
milk
everything
is
earth
soulless
earth
i
saw
of
humanity
engaged
in
fostering
their
spiritual
growth
while
the
other
half
had
merely
time
to
attend
to
their
bodily
needs
i
thought
at
first
that
there
existed
two
laws
for
two
different
species
of
man
but
my
intellect
denied
this
my
spirit
rebelled
and
i
resolved
that
i
too
would
escape
the
curse
of
the
fall
i
became
an
artist
can
analyse
the
artistic
instinct
because
i
was
endowed
with
it
myself
it
rests
on
a
broad
base
of
longing
for
freedom
freedom
from
profitable
labour
for
this
reason
a
german
philosopher
defined
beauty
as
the
unprofitable
as
soon
as
a
work
of
art
is
of
practical
use
betrays
a
purpose
or
a
tendency
its
beauty
vanishes
the
instinct
rests
on
pride
man
wants
to
play
god
in
art
not
that
he
wants
to
create
anything
new
he
ca
do
that
but
because
he
wants
to
improve
to
arrange
to
recreate
he
does
not
begin
by
admiring
his
model
nature
but
by
criticizing
it
everything
is
full
of
faults
and
he
longs
to
correct
them
pride
spurring
a
man
on
to
effort
and
the
freedom
from
work
the
curse
of
the
fall
beget
in
the
artist
the
illusion
that
he
is
standing
above
his
fellow
creatures
to
a
certain
extent
this
is
true
but
unless
he
were
constantly
recalling
this
fact
he
would
find
himself
out
that
is
to
say
find
the
unreal
in
his
activity
and
the
unjustifiable
in
his
escape
from
the
profitable
this
constant
need
of
appreciation
of
his
unprofitable
work
makes
him
vain
restless
and
often
deeply
unhappy
as
soon
as
he
comes
to
a
clear
understanding
of
himself
he
becomes
unproductive
and
goes
under
for
only
the
religious
mind
can
return
to
slavery
after
having
once
tasted
freedom
differentiate
between
genius
and
talent
to
look
upon
genius
as
a
separate
quality
is
nonsense
and
argues
a
faith
in
special
manifestation
the
great
artist
is
endowed
with
a
certain
amount
of
ability
to
acquire
some
kind
of
technical
skill
without
practice
his
ability
dies
somebody
has
said
genius
is
the
infinite
capacity
for
taking
pains
this
is
like
so
many
other
things
a
if
culture
be
added
a
rare
thing
because
knowledge
makes
all
things
clear
and
the
cultured
man
therefore
rarely
becomes
an
artist
and
a
sound
intellect
the
result
is
genius
the
natural
product
of
a
combination
of
favourable
circumstances
soon
lost
faith
in
the
sublime
character
of
my
hobby
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
call
it
my
profession
for
my
art
was
incapable
of
expressing
a
single
idea
at
the
most
it
could
represent
the
body
in
a
position
expressing
an
emotion
accompanying
a
thought
or
in
other
words
express
a
thought
at
third
hand
it
is
like
signalling
meaningless
to
all
who
can
not
read
the
signals
i
only
see
a
red
flag
but
the
soldier
sees
the
word
of
command
advance
after
all
even
plato
who
was
a
fine
intellectualist
and
an
idealist
into
the
bargain
realized
the
futility
of
art
calling
it
but
the
semblance
of
a
semblance
wherefore
he
excluded
the
artist
from
his
ideal
state
he
was
in
earnest
tried
to
find
my
way
back
into
slavery
but
i
could
not
i
tried
to
find
in
it
my
most
sacred
duty
i
tried
to
resign
myself
but
i
did
not
succeed
my
soul
was
taking
harm
and
i
was
on
the
way
to
becoming
a
beast
there
were
times
when
i
fancied
that
all
this
toil
was
a
positive
sin
in
as
far
as
it
checked
the
greater
aim
of
spiritual
development
at
such
times
i
played
truant
for
a
day
and
fled
to
nature
absorbed
in
unspeakably
blissful
meditations
but
then
again
this
bliss
appeared
to
me
in
the
light
of
a
selfish
pleasure
as
great
greater
even
than
the
pleasure
i
used
to
feel
in
my
artistic
work
conscience
the
sense
of
duty
overtook
me
like
a
fury
and
drove
me
back
to
my
yoke
which
then
seemed
beautiful
for
a
day
escape
from
this
unbearable
state
of
mind
and
win
light
and
peace
i
go
to
face
the
unknown
you
who
behold
my
dead
body
say
do
i
look
unhappy
in
death
made
while
walking
plan
of
the
world
is
the
deliverance
of
the
idea
from
the
form
art
on
the
other
hand
attempts
to
imprison
the
idea
in
a
sensuous
form
so
as
to
make
it
visible
therefore
corrects
itself
when
artistic
traffic
in
florence
surpassed
all
bounds
savonarola
came
the
profound
thinker
and
spoke
his
all
this
is
futile
and
the
artists
and
what
artists
they
were
made
a
pyre
of
their
masterpieces
oh
savonarola
was
the
object
of
the
iconoclasts
in
constantinople
what
did
the
baptists
and
breakers
of
images
want
in
the
netherlands
i
dare
not
state
it
for
fear
of
being
branded
great
striving
of
our
time
division
of
labour
benefits
the
species
but
sentences
the
individual
to
death
what
is
the
species
the
conception
of
the
whole
the
philosophers
call
it
the
idea
and
the
individuals
believe
what
they
say
and
lay
down
their
lives
for
the
idea
is
a
strange
thing
that
the
will
of
the
princes
and
the
will
of
the
people
always
clashes
is
there
a
very
simple
and
easy
remedy
at
a
riper
age
i
again
read
through
my
i
was
astonished
to
find
that
we
human
beings
are
so
little
removed
from
the
beasts
in
the
fields
i
reread
luther
catechism
in
those
days
i
made
a
few
annotations
and
drafted
a
plan
for
a
new
catechism
not
to
be
sent
in
to
the
commissioners
what
i
am
going
to
say
now
is
all
that
i
have
written
first
commandment
destroys
the
doctrine
of
one
god
for
it
assumes
other
gods
an
assumption
granted
by
christianity
monotheism
which
is
so
highly
extolled
has
had
an
adverse
influence
on
humanity
it
has
robbed
it
of
the
love
and
respect
for
the
one
and
true
god
by
leaving
evil
unexplained
second
and
third
commandments
are
blasphemous
the
author
puts
petty
and
stupid
commands
in
the
mouth
of
the
lord
commands
which
are
an
insult
to
his
omniscience
if
the
author
were
living
in
our
days
a
charge
of
blasphemy
would
be
brought
against
him
fifth
commandment
should
read
as
follows
your
inbred
feeling
of
respect
for
your
parents
shall
not
induce
you
to
admire
their
faults
you
shall
not
honour
them
beyond
their
deserts
under
no
circumstances
do
you
owe
your
parents
any
gratitude
they
have
not
done
you
a
service
by
bringing
you
into
this
world
selfishness
and
the
civil
code
of
laws
compel
them
to
clothe
and
feed
you
the
parents
who
expect
gratitude
from
their
children
there
are
some
who
even
demand
it
are
like
usurers
they
are
willing
to
risk
the
capital
as
long
as
the
interest
is
being
paid
the
reason
why
parents
more
especially
fathers
hate
their
children
so
much
more
frequently
than
they
love
them
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
presence
of
children
has
an
adverse
influence
on
the
financial
position
of
the
parents
there
are
parents
who
treat
their
children
as
if
they
were
shares
in
a
joint
stock
company
from
which
they
expect
constant
dividends
this
commandment
has
resulted
in
the
most
terrible
of
all
forms
of
government
in
the
tyranny
of
the
family
from
which
no
revolution
can
deliver
us
there
is
more
need
for
the
foundation
of
societies
for
the
protection
of
children
than
for
societies
for
the
protection
of
animals
be
continued
is
a
colony
which
has
passed
her
prime
the
period
when
she
was
a
great
power
and
like
greece
italy
and
spain
she
is
now
sinking
into
eternal
sleep
terrible
reaction
which
set
in
after
the
year
of
the
death
of
all
hope
has
had
a
demoralising
effect
on
the
new
generation
history
has
not
witnessed
for
a
long
time
a
greater
indifference
to
the
general
welfare
a
greater
selfishness
a
greater
irreligiousness
the
world
outside
the
nations
are
bellowing
with
fury
against
oppression
but
in
sweden
all
we
do
is
to
celebrate
jubilees
is
the
sole
sign
of
spiritual
life
of
the
sleeping
nation
it
is
the
discontent
which
has
thrown
itself
into
the
arms
of
resignation
to
avoid
despair
and
impotent
fury
and
pessimists
start
from
the
same
principle
the
misery
of
the
world
and
have
the
same
aim
to
die
to
the
world
and
live
to
god
greatest
sin
man
can
commit
is
to
be
a
conservative
from
selfish
motives
it
is
an
attempt
against
the
plan
of
the
world
for
the
sake
of
a
few
shillings
the
conservative
tries
to
stem
evolution
he
plants
his
back
against
the
rolling
earth
and
says
stand
still
there
is
but
one
excuse
stupidity
poor
circumstances
are
no
excuse
merely
an
explanation
wonder
whether
norway
is
not
going
to
prove
a
new
patch
on
an
old
garment
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
borg
laying
down
the
papers
and
drinking
a
small
brandy
not
bad
said
sellén
it
might
have
been
expressed
more
wittily
what
do
you
think
falk
the
usual
cry
nothing
more
shall
we
go
now
borg
looked
at
him
wondering
whether
he
was
speaking
ironically
but
he
saw
no
in
falk
face
and
so
olle
has
gone
to
happier
said
sellén
well
off
need
no
longer
trouble
about
his
dinner
i
wonder
what
the
at
the
will
say
to
it
olle
owed
him
a
little
money
what
heartlessness
what
brutality
shame
on
you
burst
out
falk
throwing
a
few
coins
on
the
table
and
putting
on
his
overcoat
are
you
sentimental
scoffed
sellén
yes
i
am
good
night
and
he
had
gone

painter
sellén
at
paris
dear
sellén
you
have
waited
a
whole
year
for
a
letter
from
me
now
i
have
news
to
tell
you
if
i
were
acting
on
my
principles
i
should
begin
with
myself
but
as
i
had
better
conform
to
the
rules
of
politeness
laid
down
by
civilized
society
seeing
that
i
am
about
to
go
out
into
the
world
to
earn
my
own
living
i
will
begin
with
you
i
heartily
congratulate
you
on
the
success
of
your
recently
exhibited
picture
isaac
took
the
notice
to
the
and
it
was
printed
without
the
knowledge
of
the
editor
who
was
furious
when
he
read
it
he
had
firmly
made
up
his
mind
that
you
should
be
a
failure
but
now
that
your
genius
has
been
acknowledged
abroad
you
are
famous
at
home
too
and
i
need
no
longer
be
ashamed
of
you
in
order
to
forget
nothing
and
to
be
as
brief
as
possible
for
i
am
lazy
as
well
as
tired
after
a
day
work
at
the
hospital
i
will
write
my
letter
in
the
shape
of
a
report
and
the
style
of
the
grey
bonnet
this
will
have
the
additional
advantage
that
you
can
more
easily
skip
those
parts
which
do
not
interest
you
the
political
situation
is
becoming
more
and
more
interesting
all
parties
have
corrupted
one
another
by
presents
and
and
now
all
of
them
are
grey
this
reaction
will
probably
end
in
socialism
there
is
a
talk
of
increasing
the
number
of
the
districts
to
and
the
ministerial
career
is
the
one
which
offers
the
best
chances
of
promotion
more
especially
as
a
man
need
not
even
have
passed
the
examination
of
an
elementary
i
met
a
the
other
day
who
is
already
a
pensioned
cabinet
minister
he
told
me
that
it
was
far
easier
to
become
a
minister
than
a
secretary
of
one
of
the
departments
they
say
the
work
is
very
much
like
the
work
of
a
man
who
signs
guarantees
it
is
only
a
matter
of
a
signature
now
and
then
it
does
matter
so
much
about
the
payment
there
is
always
a
second
guarantor
the
press
well
you
know
the
press
roughly
speaking
it
is
just
business
that
is
to
say
it
always
adopts
the
opinion
of
the
majority
and
the
majority
or
in
other
words
the
greater
number
of
subscribers
is
reactionary
one
day
i
asked
a
liberal
journalist
how
it
was
that
he
wrote
in
such
laudatory
terms
about
you
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
he
said
it
was
because
public
opinion
the
largest
number
of
subscribers
was
on
your
side
but
supposing
public
opinion
turned
against
him
i
asked
then
of
course
he
said
i
shall
turn
against
him
too
you
will
understand
that
under
these
circumstances
the
whole
generation
which
grew
up
after
and
which
is
not
represented
in
parliament
is
in
despair
and
therefore
they
are
either
nihilists
in
other
words
they
do
care
a
d
for
anything
or
they
find
their
advantage
in
turning
conservative
to
be
a
liberal
in
these
days
is
the
devil
own
job
the
financial
position
is
depressed
the
supply
of
bills
mine
at
least
reduced
no
bank
will
look
at
the
safest
bills
even
if
they
are
signed
by
two
doctors
the
triton
went
into
liquidation
as
you
know
directors
and
liquidators
took
over
the
printed
shares
but
the
shareholders
and
depositors
received
a
number
of
lithographed
ones
from
the
society
at
norrköping
which
alone
managed
to
weather
this
period
of
frauds
and
swindles
i
met
a
widow
who
had
a
handful
of
papers
connected
with
a
marble
quarry
they
were
large
beautiful
sheets
printed
in
red
and
blue
on
which
was
engraved
and
below
the
figures
just
as
if
they
were
standing
security
appeared
the
names
of
persons
three
of
them
at
least
are
knights
of
the
order
of
the
seraphim
nicholas
falk
the
friend
and
brother
sick
of
his
private
business
because
it
detracted
from
the
full
value
of
his
civic
authority
which
is
far
from
being
the
case
when
the
business
is
a
public
one
decided
to
combine
with
a
few
experts
and
found
a
bank
the
novel
feature
of
the
undertaking
was
expressed
as
follows
as
experience
truly
a
melancholy
experience
levin
is
the
author
as
you
may
guess
has
proved
that
deposit
receipts
are
not
in
themselves
a
sufficient
guarantee
for
the
return
of
deposits
that
is
deposited
money
we
the
undersigned
actuated
by
unselfish
zeal
for
the
welfare
of
home
industry
and
desirous
of
giving
greater
security
to
the
public
have
founded
a
bank
under
the
title
of
guarantee
society
limited
the
novel
and
safe
feature
of
the
enterprise
and
not
everything
new
is
safe
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
depositors
instead
of
receiving
deposit
receipts
are
given
securities
to
the
full
value
of
the
deposited
sums
etc
etc
they
do
a
brisk
business
and
you
may
imagine
what
sort
of
securities
they
issue
instead
of
deposit
receipts
levin
falk
with
his
keen
eye
for
business
recognized
at
once
the
great
advantage
to
be
reaped
from
the
services
of
a
man
with
experience
and
colossal
knowledge
of
people
acquired
through
his
business
but
to
train
him
for
all
eventualities
and
make
him
familiar
with
all
the
of
the
business
he
felled
him
to
the
ground
with
his
promissory
note
and
forced
him
into
bankruptcy
having
done
so
he
appeared
in
the
rôle
of
his
saviour
and
made
him
his
confidential
clerk
with
the
title
of
secretary
and
now
levin

heard
that
he
proposed
buying
the
forest
monastery
near
upsala
and
rebuilding
it
in
a
new
style
invented
by
his
uncle
of
the
academy
of
arts
but
his
offer
was
refused
levi
very
much
offended
sent
a
notice
to
the
under
the
heading
persecution
of
the
jews
in
the
nineteenth
century
it
won
him
the
lively
sympathy
of
the
whole
cultured
public
the
affair
would
win
him
a
seat
in
parliament
if
he
cared
for
that
distinction
a
vote
of
thanks
was
presented
to
him
by
his
as
if
levi
had
any
religion
which
was
printed
in
the
they
thanked
him
for
standing
up
for
the
rights
of
the
jews
to
buy
the
forest
monastery
the
address
was
handed
to
him
at
a
banquet
to
which
also
a
great
many
swedes
i
always
refer
the
jewish
question
to
its
rightful
domain
the
ethnographical
one
had
been
bidden
to
feast
on
bad
salmon
and
uncorked
wine
the
deeply
moved
hero
of
the
day
vide
received
on
the
same
occasion
a
present
of
crowns
in
shares
for
the
foundation
of
a
home
for
fallen
boys
of
the
evangelical
denomination
i
was
present
at
the
banquet
and
saw
a
sight
i
had
never
seen
before
i
saw
isaac
the
worse
for
drink
he
shouted
that
he
hated
me
and
you
and
falk
and
all
whites
he
alternately
called
us
whites
and
natives
and
i
had
never
heard
the
last
word
before
but
no
sooner
had
he
uttered
it
than
a
large
number
of
blacks
crowded
round
us
looking
so
ominous
that
isaac
thought
it
better
to
take
me
into
an
adjoining
room
there
he
poured
out
all
his
soul
to
me
he
spoke
of
his
sufferings
as
a
schoolboy
of
the
to
which
master
and
had
subjected
him
the
daily
knocks
and
cuffs
from
the
street
arabs
but
what
roused
my
indignation
more
than
anything
else
was
an
incident
which
had
happened
to
him
during
his
military
service
he
was
called
up
to
the
front
at
vespers
and
ordered
to
recite
the
lord
prayer
as
he
did
not
know
it
he
was
scoffed
and
jeered
at
his
account
made
me
change
my
opinion
of
him
and
his
race
religious
swindle
and
charitable
fraud
are
more
rampant
than
ever
and
make
life
in
our
country
very
unpleasant
you
will
remember
two
imps
of
satan
falk
and
homan
the
two
pettiest
vainest
and
most
malicious
creatures
who
ever
idled
away
their
days
you
know
the
crèche
they
had
founded
and
its
end
their
latest
achievement
is
a
home
for
fallen
women
and
the
first
inmate
received
on
my
recommendation
was
marie
the
poor
girl
had
lent
all
her
savings
to
a
fellow
who
absconded
with
them
she
was
only
too
happy
to
find
a
home
where
she
would
be
kept
free
of
charge
and
be
able
to
retrieve
her
character
she
told
me
that
she
did
not
mind
all
the
religious
palaver
which
is
unfortunately
inseparable
from
an
enterprise
of
this
sort
as
long
as
she
could
count
on
her
cup
of
coffee
in
the
morning
the
rev
skore
whom
you
will
no
doubt
remember
has
not
been
made
and
from
sheer
annoyance
he
is
begging
for
funds
to
build
a
new
church
printed
signed
by
all
the
wealthiest
magnates
of
sweden
are
sent
out
to
appeal
to
the
charitable
public
the
church
which
is
to
be
three
times
the
size
of
the
church
on
the
blasieholm
and
connected
with
a
tower
is
to
be
built
on
the
old
site
of
catherine
the
latter
is
supposed
to
be
too
small
to
satisfy
the
great
spiritual
needs
from
which
the
swedish
nation
is
suffering
at
the
moment
and
is
therefore
to
be
pulled
down
the
sum
collected
has
already
reached
such
dimensions
that
a
treasurer
had
to
be
appointed
with
free
lodging
and
fuel
who
do
you
think
is
the
treasurer
you
would
never
guess
struve
struve
has
become
somewhat
religious
these
days
i
say
because
it
is
not
much
only
just
enough
for
his
position
for
he
is
patronized
by
the
faithful
this
does
however
not
interfere
with
his
journalism
and
his
drinking
but
his
heart
is
not
soft
on
the
contrary
he
is
most
bitter
against
all
those
who
have
not
come
down
between
you
and
me
he
has
very
much
deteriorated
therefore
he
hates
you
and
falk
and
he
has
sworn
to
slate
you
next
time
you
are
heard
of
he
had
to
submit
to
the
marriage
ceremony
for
the
sake
of
the
free
lodging
and
fuel
he
was
married
to
his
wife
in
the
white
mountains
i
was
one
of
the
witnesses
his
wife
too
has
been
converted
for
she
is
under
the
impression
that
religion
is
good
form
lundell
has
left
the
religious
sphere
and
is
painting
nothing
but
portraits
of
directors
he
has
been
made
assistant
at
the
academy
of
arts
he
has
also
become
immortal
for
he
has
managed
to
smuggle
a
painting
of
his
into
the
national
museum
it
was
accomplished
by
a
very
simple
trick
and
ought
to
encourage
imitators
smith
made
a
present
to
the
national
museum
of
one
of
lundell
genre
pictures
a
service
which
lundell
repaid
by
painting
his
portrait
gratis
splendid
is
it
the
end
of
a
romance
one
sunday
morning
at
the
hour
when
the
sabbath
peace
is
not
disturbed
by
the
terrible
church
bells
i
was
sitting
in
my
room
smoking
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
tall
man
whose
face
seemed
familiar
to
me
entered
it
was
rehnhjelm
we
each
other
he
is
manager
of
a
large
factory
and
quite
satisfied
with
his
lot
presently
there
was
another
knock
it
was
falk
more
of
him
later
on
we
revived
old
memories
and
discussed
mutual
friends
but
by
and
by
there
was
a
pause
that
strange
silence
which
so
frequently
occurs
after
a
lively
conversation
rehnhjelm
took
up
a
book
turned
over
the
leaves
and
read
out
a
cæsarean
operation
an
academic
treatise
which
with
the
permission
of
the
illustrious
medical
faculty
will
be
publicly
discussed
in
the
little
lecture
room
of
the
university
what
horrible
diagrams
who
in
the
world
is
the
unfortunate
being
cursed
thus
to
haunt
the
living
after
his
death
you
will
find
it
on
page
i
said
he
went
on
reading
the
pelvis
which
as
no
is
preserved
in
the
pathological
collection
of
the
academy
no
that
ca
be
it
agnes
rundgren
spinster
the
man
face
turned
as
white
as
chalk
he
got
up
and
drank
some
water
did
you
know
the
woman
i
asked
in
order
to
distract
his
thoughts
did
i
know
her
she
was
on
the
stage
and
i
knew
her
at
after
leaving
she
was
engaged
in
a
stockholm
café
under
the
name
of
beda
petterson
then
you
should
have
seen
falk
it
came
to
a
scene
which
ended
in
rehnhjelm
cursing
all
women
and
falk
greatly
excited
replying
that
there
were
two
kinds
of
women
which
differed
from
each
other
as
much
as
angels
and
devils
he
was
so
moved
that
rehnhjelm
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
now
to
falk
i
purposely
left
him
to
the
last
he
is
engaged
to
be
married
how
did
it
happen
he
himself
says
we
just
met
one
another
as
you
know
i
have
no
rigid
opinions
but
cultivate
an
open
mind
but
from
what
i
have
seen
up
to
now
it
is
undeniable
that
love
is
something
of
which
we
bachelors
know
nothing
what
we
call
love
is
nothing
but
frivolity
you
may
laugh
if
you
like
you
old
scoffer
only
in
very
bad
plays
have
i
seen
such
a
rapid
development
of
character
as
i
had
occasion
to
watch
in
falk
you
wo
be
surprised
to
hear
that
his
engagement
was
not
all
plain
sailing
the
father
an
old
widower
a
selfish
army
pensioner
looked
upon
his
daughter
as
an
investment
hoping
that
she
would
marry
well
and
thereby
secure
him
a
comfortable
old
age
nothing
at
all
unusual
he
therefore
bluntly
refused
his
consent
you
should
have
seen
falk
he
called
on
the
old
man
again
and
again
he
was
kicked
out
and
yet
he
called
again
and
told
the
old
egoist
to
the
face
that
he
would
marry
his
daughter
without
his
consent
if
he
continued
to
object
i
am
not
sure
but
i
believe
it
actually
came
to
fisticuffs
one
evening
falk
had
accompanied
his
sweetheart
home
they
had
both
spent
the
evening
at
the
house
of
one
of
the
girl
relatives
to
whom
falk
had
introduced
himself
when
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
in
which
the
girl
lives
they
saw
by
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
that
her
father
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
he
lives
in
a
small
house
which
belongs
to
him
falk
knocked
at
the
garden
gate
but
nobody
came
to
open
it
at
last
he
climbed
over
and
was
on
the
other
side
attacked
by
a
large
dog
he
got
the
better
of
the
brute
and
shut
it
up
in
the
imagine
the
nervous
falk
then
he
compelled
the
porter
to
get
up
and
open
the
gate
now
they
had
gained
the
yard
and
stood
before
the
front
door
he
hammered
it
with
a
large
stone
but
no
reply
came
from
within
he
searched
the
garden
and
found
a
ladder
by
means
of
which
he
reached
the
old
man
window
open
the
door
he
shouted
or
i
smash
the
window
if
you
smash
the
window
you
rascal
yelled
the
old
man
i
shoot
you
falk
immediately
smashed
the
window
for
a
few
moments
there
was
silence
finally
a
voice
came
from
within
the
fortress
you
are
my
man
i
consent
i
not
fond
of
smashing
windows
explained
falk
but
nothing
i
would
not
do
to
win
your
daughter
the
matter
was
settled
and
they
became
engaged
i
do
know
whether
you
know
that
parliament
has
carried
through
its
reorganization
of
the
public
offices
doubling
the
salaries
and
the
number
of
posts
so
that
a
young
man
in
the
first
division
is
now
in
a
position
to
marry
falk
is
going
to
be
married
in
the
autumn
his
wife
will
keep
her
post
at
the
school
i
know
next
to
nothing
of
the
woman
question
it
does
interest
me
but
i
believe
that
our
generation
will
get
rid
of
the
last
remnant
of
the
eastern
conception
which
still
clings
to
marriage
in
the
days
to
come
husband
and
wife
will
enter
into
a
partnership
where
both
will
retain
their
independence
they
will
not
try
to
convert
each
other
but
will
mutually
respect
their
weaknesses
and
live
together
in
a
friendship
which
will
never
be
strained
by
the
demands
of
one
of
the
partners
for
amorous
demonstrations
i
look
upon
nicholas
falk
the
charitable
as
nothing
more
than
a
and
i
am
sure
she
does
so
herself
most
women
marry
for
a
home
where
they
need
not
work
be
their
own
mistress
as
it
is
called
the
fact
that
marriage
is
on
the
decline
is
as
much
the
woman
fault
as
the
man
but
i
can
not
make
falk
out
he
is
studying
numismatics
with
an
almost
unnatural
zeal
he
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
was
engaged
in
writing
a
on
numismatics
which
he
would
endeavour
to
introduce
into
the
schools
where
this
science
is
to
be
taught
he
never
reads
a
paper
he
does
not
know
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
and
he
seems
to
have
abandoned
the
idea
of
writing
he
lives
only
for
his
work
and
his
fiancée
whom
he
worships
but
i
do
trust
his
calm
falk
is
a
political
fanatic
well
aware
that
he
would
be
consumed
if
he
allowed
the
fire
to
burn
freely
therefore
he
tries
to
stifle
it
with
hard
monotonous
work
but
i
think
that
he
will
succeed
in
spite
of
all
his
restraint
the
day
is
bound
to
come
when
he
will
cast
aside
all
and
burst
out
into
fresh
flames
between
you
and
me
i
believe
he
belongs
to
one
of
those
secret
societies
which
are
responsible
for
the
reaction
and
militarism
on
the
continent
not
very
long
ago
at
the
reading
of
the
king
speech
in
parliament
i
saw
him
dressed
in
a
purple
cloak
with
a
feather
in
his
hat
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
and
i
thought
no
it
would
be
a
sin
to
say
what
i
thought
but
when
the
prime
minister
read
his
majesty
gracious
propositions
respecting
the
state
of
the
country
and
its
needs
i
saw
a
look
in
falk
eyes
which
plainly
said
what
on
earth
does
his
majesty
know
of
the
condition
and
needs
of
the
country
that
man
oh
that
man
i
conclude
my
review
without
having
forgotten
anybody
enough
for
you
shall
soon
hear
from
me
again
b
chapter
xxx
epilogue
doubtless
there
is
not
another
street
in
stockholm
as
ugly
and
not
another
house
as
old
as
dirty
and
as
gloomy
the
entrance
gate
has
the
inviting
appearance
of
a
disused
gallows
the
rubble
stones
in
the
yard
have
moved
more
closely
together
in
the
course
of
time
so
that
a
few
small
blades
of
grass
have
been
able
to
shoot
up
the
house
stands
by
itself
like
an
old
hermit
who
has
sought
a
solitary
spot
in
which
to
collapse
there
has
once
been
an
assaying
office
in
the
yard
and
the
outside
walls
are
blackened
with
smoke
the
chinks
between
the
window
frames
and
the
walls
are
grown
over
and
the
house
looks
as
if
it
had
not
washed
its
face
or
eyes
for
a
generation
the
foundation
has
settled
and
the
building
is
stooping
to
the
left
the
leaking
gutter
has
been
weeping
tears
which
have
drawn
black
furrows
all
over
the
front
of
the
building
the
plastering
is
crumbling
off
here
and
there
and
on
windy
nights
one
can
hear
it
rattling
down
the
walls
into
the
street
below
the
house
looks
like
an
old
dowager
house
of
poverty
recklessness
carelessness
and
vice
and
yet
there
are
two
people
who
can
not
pass
through
the
street
without
stopping
to
look
at
the
miserable
frowning
old
building
with
emotion
almost
amounting
to
love
to
them
the
entrance
gate
is
a
triumphal
arch
the
weeds
and
the
gutter
a
green
meadow
and
a
murmuring
brook
the
black
house
a
charming
ruin
containing
lovely
memories
it
is
more
even
for
whenever
they
pass
it
the
air
vibrates
with
music
perfumes
rise
from
the
earth
and
they
see
the
sun
shining
even
on
the
cloudiest
autumn
day
there
have
been
times
when
they
forgot
themselves
so
far
as
to
kiss
each
other
but
they
have
always
been
a
little
mad
these
good
people
three
years
ago
our
young
friend
we
may
call
him
friend
since
he
repented
of
his
youthful
errors
apologised
to
society
and
became
a
respectable
individual
serving
the
country
and
wearing
purple
in
the
house
of
parliament
our
young
friend
i
say
was
busy
on
the
third
floor
of
the
ugly
old
house
with
a
sheet
of
pins
between
his
lips
a
hammer
in
his
and
a
pair
of
pincers
under
his
arm
he
was
standing
on
a
ladder
putting
up
curtains
in
a
small
room
furnished
only
with
a
tiny
sofa
a
tiny
a
small
desk
and
a
very
small
bed
with
white
curtains
in
the
the
faithful
isaac
in
was
engaged
in
spreading
paste
on
a
piece
of
wallpaper
stretched
on
an
which
rested
on
two
chairs
he
was
whistling
and
singing
one
unknown
song
after
the
other
to
quite
tunes
when
he
was
tired
of
working
he
prepared
luncheon
on
an
empty
box
standing
before
the
window
outside
the
sun
was
shining
into
the
neighbour
garden
it
was
a
tiny
garden
squeezed
between
the
walls
of
the
houses
it
had
a
pear
tree
in
full
bloom
and
two
elder
bushes
covered
with
blossoms
between
the
gables
a
piece
of
blue
sky
was
visible
and
the
mast
heads
of
the
timber
barges
in
the
harbour
isaac
had
been
to
the
dairy
had
bought
sandwiches
and
porter
had
papered
the
future
mistress
room
had
purchased
oleanders
and
ivy
so
that
the
landing
windows
with
their
black
frames
should
not
shock
the
young
wife
as
she
entered
her
new
home
he
would
have
liked
to
paint
them
but
he
was
afraid
that
she
might
object
to
the
smell
a
cab
stopped
before
the
front
door
it
borg
said
isaac
what
the
dickens
does
he
want
here
and
that
pest
levin
is
with
him
it
was
a
long
visit
lasting
ten
minutes
and
a
disagreeable
one
but
falk
bore
it
patiently
like
any
other
trial
he
had
for
ever
broken
with
the
past
in
one
respect
at
least
in
another
he
was
bound
for
he
had
been
compelled
during
the
ten
minutes
to
sign
once
more
the
next
visitors
were
the
falk
and
homan
they
found
the
paper
in
the
too
dark
and
the
paper
in
the
young
wife
room
too
light
they
thought
the
curtains
in
the
room
were
not
wide
enough
the
carpet
a
bad
match
to
the
furniture
the
clock
and
the
chandelier
too
dear
for
its
plainness
one
piece
of
furniture
in
the
young
wife
room
especially
roused
their
critical
faculty
and
gave
rise
to
a
long
whispered
conversation
they
called
the
kitchen
black
the
landing
dirty
the
entrance
terrible
but
otherwise
they
said
everything
was
quite
nice
much
nicer
than
the
yard
where
there
was
not
even
a
porter
led
one
to
expect
this
was
the
second
plague
and
it
passed
like
everything
else
in
this
world
but
isaac
had
lost
some
of
his
gaiety
after
the
criticism
of
his
wallpapers
and
falk
realized
for
a
moment
that
it
was
a
miserable
hole
he
opened
the
windows
to
let
out
the
evil
spirits
which
had
invaded
his
pleasure
garden
isaac
declared
that
during
the
wedding
days
he
would
have
the
two
women
shut
up
in
the
debtors
prison
so
as
to
keep
them
safely
away
and
then
then
she
came
he
was
standing
at
the
window
and
he
saw
her
when
she
was
still
too
far
off
to
be
seen
he
expected
to
be
believed
when
he
maintained
that
she
radiated
light
and
that
the
street
through
which
she
was
walking
was
bathed
in
sunshine
of
course
he
could
have
told
endless
stories
of
her
kindness
sweetness
and
beauty
but
not
even
she
believed
them
and
it
is
not
worth
while
repeating
them
she
entered
her
future
home
and
found
everything
charming
isaac
went
into
the
kitchen
to
split
some
wood
and
light
the
kitchen
fire
nobody
missed
him
until
he
returned
with
a
tray
bearing
some
cups
of
chocolate
it
amused
him
he
knew
that
lovers
never
miss
anybody
in
the
wide
world
and
he
found
the
terrible
selfishness
which
is
called
love
a
very
amiable
quality
moreover
everybody
admits
that
it
is
justified
what
people
said
about
it
they
said
well
and
so
falk
is
married
is
he
whom
did
he
marry
a
schoolmistress
ugh
a
woman
with
blue
spectacles
and
short
hair
and
the
questioner
had
all
the
information
he
wanted
if
the
answer
had
been
he
married
old
kochstrom
daughter
the
second
question
would
have
been
did
he
get
any
money
with
her
the
world
asks
no
further
questions
and
everything
would
be
all
right
if
this
were
all
but
the
world
demands
that
a
couple
which
has
three
times
given
the
clergyman
the
trouble
to
read
the
banns
and
the
community
to
listen
to
them
which
has
forced
its
to
engage
in
genealogical
research
and
send
a
reporter
to
the
wedding
the
world
demands
that
such
a
couple
shall
be
happy
woe
to
it
if
it
is
not
supposing
that
on
coming
home
from
school
tired
with
her
work
angry
at
a
slight
depressed
because
some
of
her
efforts
have
proved
a
failure
she
should
meet
a
friend
in
the
street
who
takes
her
hand
and
says
you
do
look
too
happy
elizabeth
then
woe
to
him
supposing
that
on
leaving
his
office
in
despair
because
he
has
been
overlooked
instead
of
promoted
he
should
meet
a
friend
who
finds
him
looking
depressed
then
woe
to
her
unhappy
people
if
you
dare
to
be
anything
but
happy
it
was
a
winter
evening
two
or
three
years
later
she
was
bending
over
her
writing
desk
correcting
copybooks
he
was
sitting
in
his
room
computing
assessments
of
property
the
pens
were
scribbling
the
clock
was
ticking
and
the
singing
whenever
he
looked
up
from
his
documents
at
her
sweet
face
she
raised
her
eyes
their
glances
met
and
they
nodded
to
each
other
as
if
they
had
been
parted
for
a
long
time
and
they
continued
working
but
finally
he
grew
tired
of
his
work
talk
to
me
a
little
he
pleaded
and
she
eagerly
complied
with
his
request
but
what
do
they
talk
about
the
scoffer
borg
once
asked
that
question
when
he
declared
matrimony
to
be
an
impossibility
from
the
point
of
view
of
natural
science
he
laid
down
the
proposition
that
the
moment
must
come
when
every
subject
had
been
discussed
when
each
partner
knew
every
thought
and
opinion
of
the
other
and
when
absolute
silence
was
bound
to
reign
the
fool
