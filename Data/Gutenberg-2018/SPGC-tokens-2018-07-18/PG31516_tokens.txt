this
etext
was
produced
from
fiction
extensive
research
did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was
renewed
little
whimsy
now
and
then
makes
for
good
balance
theoretically
you
could
find
this
type
of
humor
anywhere
but
only
a
topflight
we
thought
could
have
written
this
story
in
just
this
way
eyes
have
by
philip
dick
it
was
quite
by
accident
i
discovered
this
incredible
invasion
of
earth
by
lifeforms
from
another
planet
as
yet
i
have
done
anything
about
it
i
ca
think
of
anything
to
do
i
wrote
to
the
government
and
they
sent
back
a
pamphlet
on
the
repair
and
maintenance
of
frame
houses
anyhow
the
whole
thing
is
known
i
not
the
first
to
discover
it
maybe
it
even
under
control
i
was
sitting
in
my
idly
turning
the
pages
of
a
paperbacked
book
someone
had
left
on
the
bus
when
i
came
across
the
reference
that
first
put
me
on
the
trail
for
a
moment
i
respond
it
took
some
time
for
the
full
import
to
sink
in
after
comprehended
it
seemed
odd
i
had
noticed
it
right
away
the
reference
was
clearly
to
a
nonhuman
species
of
incredible
properties
not
indigenous
to
earth
a
species
i
hasten
to
point
out
customarily
masquerading
as
ordinary
human
beings
their
disguise
however
became
transparent
in
the
face
of
the
following
observations
by
the
author
it
was
at
once
obvious
the
author
knew
everything
knew
everything
and
was
taking
it
in
his
stride
the
line
and
i
tremble
remembering
it
even
now
read
his
eyes
slowly
roved
about
the
vague
chills
assailed
me
i
tried
to
picture
the
eyes
did
they
roll
like
dimes
the
passage
indicated
not
they
seemed
to
move
through
the
air
not
over
the
surface
rather
rapidly
apparently
no
one
in
the
story
was
surprised
that
what
tipped
me
off
no
sign
of
amazement
at
such
an
outrageous
thing
later
the
matter
was
amplified
his
eyes
moved
from
person
to
there
it
was
in
a
nutshell
the
eyes
had
clearly
come
apart
from
the
rest
of
him
and
were
on
their
own
my
heart
pounded
and
my
breath
choked
in
my
windpipe
i
had
stumbled
on
an
accidental
mention
of
a
totally
unfamiliar
race
obviously
yet
to
the
characters
in
the
book
it
was
perfectly
natural
which
suggested
they
belonged
to
the
same
species
and
the
author
a
slow
suspicion
burned
in
my
mind
the
author
was
taking
it
rather
in
his
stride
evidently
he
felt
this
was
quite
a
usual
thing
he
made
absolutely
no
attempt
to
conceal
this
knowledge
the
story
continued
presently
his
eyes
fastened
on
julia
being
a
lady
had
at
least
the
breeding
to
feel
indignant
she
is
described
as
blushing
and
knitting
her
brows
angrily
at
this
i
sighed
with
relief
they
were
the
narrative
continues
slowly
calmly
his
eyes
examined
every
inch
of
great
scott
but
here
the
girl
turned
and
stomped
off
and
the
matter
ended
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
gasping
with
horror
my
wife
and
family
regarded
me
in
wonder
what
wrong
dear
my
wife
asked
i
could
tell
her
knowledge
like
this
was
too
much
for
the
ordinary
person
i
had
to
keep
it
to
myself
nothing
i
gasped
i
leaped
up
snatched
the
book
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
in
the
garage
i
continued
reading
there
was
more
trembling
i
read
the
next
revealing
passage
he
put
his
arm
around
julia
presently
she
asked
him
if
he
would
remove
his
arm
he
immediately
did
so
with
a
it
not
said
what
was
done
with
the
arm
after
the
fellow
had
removed
it
maybe
it
was
left
standing
upright
in
the
corner
maybe
it
was
thrown
away
i
do
care
in
any
case
the
full
meaning
was
there
staring
me
right
in
the
face
here
was
a
race
of
creatures
capable
of
removing
portions
of
their
anatomy
at
will
eyes
arms
and
maybe
more
without
batting
an
eyelash
my
knowledge
of
biology
came
in
handy
at
this
point
obviously
they
were
simple
beings
some
sort
of
primitive
things
beings
no
more
developed
than
starfish
starfish
can
do
the
same
thing
you
know
i
read
on
and
came
to
this
incredible
revelation
tossed
off
coolly
by
the
author
without
the
faintest
tremor
outside
the
movie
theater
we
split
up
part
of
us
went
inside
part
over
to
the
cafe
for
binary
fission
obviously
splitting
in
half
and
forming
two
entities
probably
each
lower
half
went
to
the
cafe
it
being
farther
and
the
upper
halves
to
the
movies
i
read
on
hands
shaking
i
had
really
stumbled
onto
something
here
my
mind
reeled
as
i
made
out
this
passage
i
afraid
there
no
doubt
about
it
poor
bibney
has
lost
his
head
which
was
followed
by
and
bob
says
he
has
utterly
no
yet
bibney
got
around
as
well
as
the
next
person
the
next
person
however
was
just
as
strange
he
was
soon
described
as
totally
lacking
in
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
thing
in
the
next
passage
julia
whom
i
had
thought
to
be
the
one
normal
person
reveals
herself
as
also
being
an
alien
life
form
similar
to
the
rest
quite
deliberately
julia
had
given
her
heart
to
the
young
it
did
relate
what
the
final
disposition
of
the
organ
was
but
i
did
really
care
it
was
evident
julia
had
gone
right
on
living
in
her
usual
manner
like
all
the
others
in
the
book
without
heart
arms
eyes
brains
viscera
dividing
up
in
two
when
the
occasion
demanded
without
a
qualm
thereupon
she
gave
him
her
i
sickened
the
rascal
now
had
her
hand
as
well
as
her
heart
i
shudder
to
think
what
he
done
with
them
by
this
time
he
took
her
not
content
to
wait
he
had
to
start
dismantling
her
on
his
own
flushing
crimson
i
slammed
the
book
shut
and
leaped
to
my
feet
but
not
in
time
to
escape
one
last
reference
to
those
carefree
bits
of
anatomy
whose
travels
had
originally
thrown
me
on
the
track
her
eyes
followed
him
all
the
way
down
the
road
and
across
the
i
rushed
from
the
garage
and
back
inside
the
warm
house
as
if
the
accursed
things
were
following
me
my
wife
and
children
were
playing
monopoly
in
the
kitchen
i
joined
them
and
played
with
frantic
fervor
brow
feverish
teeth
chattering
i
had
had
enough
of
the
thing
i
want
to
hear
no
more
about
it
let
them
come
on
let
them
invade
earth
i
do
want
to
get
mixed
up
in
it
i
have
absolutely
no
stomach
for
it
