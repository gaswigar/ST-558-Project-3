to
miss
madam
it
will
be
naturally
expected
that
when
i
write
the
life
of
i
should
dedicate
it
to
some
young
lady
whose
wit
and
beauty
might
be
the
proper
subject
of
a
comparison
with
the
heroine
of
my
piece
this
those
who
see
i
have
done
it
in
prefixing
your
name
to
my
work
will
much
more
confirmedly
expect
me
to
do
and
indeed
your
character
would
enable
me
to
run
some
length
into
a
parallel
tho
you
nor
any
one
else
are
at
all
like
the
matchless
you
see
madam
i
have
some
value
for
your
when
in
a
dedication
which
is
properly
a
panegyrick
i
speak
against
not
for
you
but
i
remember
it
is
a
life
which
i
am
presenting
you
and
why
should
i
expose
my
veracity
to
any
hazard
in
the
front
of
the
work
considering
what
i
have
done
in
the
body
indeed
i
wish
it
was
possible
to
write
a
dedication
and
get
any
thing
by
it
without
one
word
of
flattery
but
since
it
is
not
come
on
and
i
hope
to
shew
my
delicacy
at
least
in
the
compliments
i
intend
to
pay
you
then
madam
i
must
tell
the
world
that
you
have
tickled
up
and
brightned
many
strokes
in
this
work
by
your
pencil
you
have
intimately
conversed
with
me
one
of
the
greatest
wits
and
scholars
of
my
age
you
keep
very
good
hours
and
frequently
spend
an
useful
day
before
others
begin
to
enjoy
it
this
i
will
take
my
oath
on
for
i
am
admitted
to
your
presence
in
a
morning
before
other
servants
are
up
when
i
have
constantly
found
you
reading
in
good
books
and
if
ever
i
have
drawn
you
upon
me
i
have
always
felt
you
very
heavy
you
have
a
virtue
which
enables
you
to
rise
early
and
study
hard
and
that
is
forbearing
to
yourself
and
this
in
spite
of
all
the
luscious
temptations
of
puddings
and
custards
exciting
the
brute
as
calls
it
to
rebel
this
is
a
virtue
which
i
can
greatly
admire
though
i
much
question
whether
i
could
imitate
it
a
circumstance
greatly
to
your
honour
that
by
means
of
your
extraordinary
merit
and
beauty
you
was
carried
into
the
at
the
by
the
discerning
before
the
age
that
other
young
ladies
generally
arrived
at
that
honour
and
while
your
mamma
herself
existed
in
her
perfect
bloom
here
you
was
observed
in
dancing
to
balance
your
body
exactly
and
to
weigh
every
motion
with
the
exact
and
equal
measure
of
time
and
tune
and
though
you
sometimes
made
a
false
step
by
leaning
too
much
to
one
side
yet
every
body
said
you
would
one
time
or
other
dance
perfectly
well
and
uprightly
i
can
not
forbear
mentioning
those
pretty
little
sonnets
and
sprightly
compositions
which
though
they
came
from
you
with
so
much
ease
might
be
mentioned
to
the
praise
of
a
great
or
grave
character
and
now
madam
i
have
done
with
you
it
only
remains
to
pay
my
acknowledgments
to
an
author
whose
stile
i
have
exactly
followed
in
this
life
it
being
the
properest
for
biography
the
reader
i
believe
easily
guesses
i
mean
it
was
who
taught
me
to

you

me

herewith
i
transmit
you
a
copy
of
sweet
dear
pretty
a
little
book
which
this
winter
hath
produced
of
which
i
make
no
doubt
you
have
already
heard
mention
from
some
of
your
neighbouring
clergy
for
we
have
made
it
our
common
business
here
not
only
to
cry
it
up
but
to
preach
it
up
likewise
the
pulpit
as
well
as
the
hath
resounded
with
its
praise
and
it
is
expected
shortly
that
his
l
p
will
recommend
it
in
a
letter
to
our
whole
body
and
this
example
i
am
confident
will
be
imitated
by
all
our
cloth
in
the
country
for
besides
speaking
well
of
a
brother
in
the
character
of
the
reverend
the
useful
and
truly
religious
doctrine
of
is
every
where
inculcated
this
book
is
the
soul
of
discretion
wit
fancy
fine
thought
and
morality
there
is
an
ease
a
natural
air
a
dignified
simplicity
and
measured
fullness
in
it
that
resembling
life
it
the
author
hath
reconciled
the
to
the
the
thought
is
every
where
exactly
cloathed
by
the
expression
and
becomes
its
dress
as
and
as
close
as
her
country
habit
or
she
doth
her
no
when
modest
beauty
seeks
to
hide
itself
by
casting
off
the
pride
of
ornament
and
displays
itself
without
any
covering
which
it
frequently
doth
in
this
admirable
work
and
presents
images
to
the
reader
which
the
coldest
zealot
can
not
read
without
emotion
for
my
own
part
and
i
believe
i
may
say
the
same
of
all
the
clergy
of
my
acquaintance
i
have
done
nothing
but
read
it
to
others
and
hear
others
again
read
it
to
me
ever
since
it
came
into
my
hands
and
i
find
i
am
like
to
do
nothing
else
for
i
know
not
how
long
yet
to
come
because
if
i
lay
the
book
down
comes
after
when
it
has
dwelt
all
day
long
upon
the
ear
it
takes
possession
all
night
of
the
fancy
it
hath
witchcraft
in
every
page
of
oh
i
feel
an
emotion
even
while
i
am
relating
this
methinks
i
see
at
this
instant
with
all
the
pride
of
ornament
cast
off
little
book
charming
get
thee
gone
face
the
world
in
which
thou
wilt
find
nothing
like
happy
would
it
be
for
mankind
if
all
other
books
were
burnt
that
we
might
do
nothing
but
read
thee
all
day
and
dream
of
thee
all
night
thou
alone
art
sufficient
to
teach
us
as
much
morality
as
we
want
dost
thou
not
teach
us
to
pray
to
sing
psalms
and
to
honour
the
clergy
are
not
these
the
whole
duty
of
man
forgive
me
o
author
of
mentioning
the
name
of
a
book
so
unequal
to
thine
but
now
i
think
of
it
who
is
the
author
where
is
he
what
is
he
that
hath
hitherto
been
able
to
hide
such
an
encircling
spirit
he
possesses
every
quality
that
art
could
have
charm
by
yet
hath
lent
it
to
and
concealed
it
in
nature
the
comprehensiveness
of
his
imagination
must
be
truly
prodigious
it
has
stretched
out
this
diminutive
mere
grain
of
a
poor
girl
little
into
a
resemblance
of
that
heaven
which
the
best
of
good
books
has
compared
it
to
be
short
this
book
will
live
to
the
age
of
the
patriarchs
and
like
them
will
carry
on
the
good
work
many
hundreds
of
years
hence
among
our
posterity
who
will
not
hesitate
their
esteem
with
restraint
if
the
granted
exemptions
to
men
who
begat
a
children
for
the
republick
what
distinction
if
policy
and
we
should
ever
be
reconciled
should
we
find
to
reward
this
father
of
millions
which
are
to
owe
formation
to
the
future
effect
of
his
i
feel
another
emotion
as
soon
as
you
have
read
this
yourself
five
or
six
times
over
which
may
possibly
happen
within
a
week
i
desire
you
would
give
it
to
my
little
as
a
present
from
me
this
being
the
only
education
we
intend
henceforth
to
give
our
daughters
and
pray
let
your
read
it
over
or
read
it
to
them
both
your
self
and
the
neighbouring
clergy
will
supply
yourselves
for
the
pulpit
from
the
as
soon
as
the
fourth
edition
is
published
i
am
most
humble
tho
tickletext
oliver
tickletext
i
received
the
favour
of
yours
with
the
inclosed
book
and
really
must
own
myself
sorry
to
see
the
report
i
have
heard
of
an
epidemical
phrenzy
now
raging
in
town
confirmed
in
the
person
of
my
friend
if
i
had
not
known
your
hand
i
should
from
the
sentiments
and
stile
of
the
letter
have
imagined
it
to
have
come
from
the
author
of
the
famous
apology
which
was
sent
me
last
summer
and
on
my
reading
the
remarkable
paragraph
of
fulness
that
resembling
life
to
a
young
baronet
he
cry
out
ly
c
b
by
g
but
i
have
since
observed
that
this
as
well
as
many
other
expressions
in
your
letter
was
borrowed
from
those
remarkable
epistles
which
the
author
or
the
editor
hath
prefix
to
the
second
edition
which
you
send
me
of
his
book
is
it
possible
that
you
or
any
of
your
function
can
be
in
earnest
or
think
the
cause
of
religion
or
morality
can
want
such
slender
support
god
forbid
they
should
as
for
honour
to
the
clergy
i
am
sorry
to
see
them
so
solicitous
about
it
for
if
worldly
honour
be
meant
it
is
what
their
predecessors
in
the
pure
and
primitive
age
never
had
or
sought
indeed
the
secure
satisfaction
of
a
good
conscience
the
approbation
of
the
wise
and
good
which
never
were
or
will
be
the
generality
of
mankind
and
the
extatick
pleasure
of
contemplating
that
their
ways
are
acceptable
to
the
great
creator
of
the
universe
will
always
attend
those
who
really
deserve
these
blessings
but
for
worldly
honours
they
are
often
the
purchase
of
force
and
fraud
we
sometimes
see
them
in
an
eminent
degree
possessed
by
men
who
are
notorious
for
luxury
pride
cruelty
treachery
and
the
most
abandoned
prostitution
wretches
who
are
ready
to
invent
and
maintain
schemes
repugnant
to
the
interest
the
liberty
and
the
happiness
of
mankind
not
to
supply
their
necessities
or
even
conveniencies
but
to
pamper
their
avarice
and
ambition
and
if
this
be
the
road
to
worldly
honours
god
forbid
the
clergy
should
be
even
suspected
of
walking
in
it
the
history
of
i
was
acquainted
with
long
before
i
received
it
from
you
from
my
neighbourhood
to
the
scene
of
action
indeed
i
was
in
hopes
that
young
woman
would
have
contented
herself
with
the
she
hath
attained
and
rather
suffered
her
little
arts
to
have
been
forgotten
than
have
revived
their
remembrance
and
endeavoured
by
perverting
and
misrepresenting
facts
to
be
thought
to
deserve
what
she
now
enjoys
for
though
we
do
not
imagine
her
the
author
of
the
narrative
itself
yet
we
must
suppose
the
instructions
were
given
by
her
as
well
as
the
reward
to
the
composer
who
that
is
though
you
so
earnestly
require
of
me
i
shall
leave
you
to
guess
from
that
eloquence
with
which
the
work
abounds
and
that
excellent
knack
of
making
every
character
amiable
which
he
lays
his
hands
on
but
before
i
send
you
some
papers
relating
to
this
matter
which
will
set
and
some
others
in
a
very
different
light
than
that
in
which
they
appear
in
the
printed
book
i
must
beg
leave
to
make
some
few
remarks
on
the
book
itself
and
its
tendency
admitting
it
to
be
a
true
relation
towards
improving
morality
or
doing
any
good
either
to
the
present
age
or
posterity
which
when
i
have
done
i
shall
i
flatter
myself
stand
excused
from
delivering
it
either
into
the
hands
of
my
daughter
or
my
the
instruction
which
it
conveys
to
is
i
think
very
plainly
this
to
look
out
for
their
masters
as
sharp
as
they
can
the
consequences
of
which
will
be
besides
neglect
of
their
business
and
the
using
all
manner
of
means
to
come
at
ornaments
of
their
persons
that
if
the
master
is
not
a
fool
they
will
be
debauched
by
him
and
if
he
is
a
fool
they
will
marry
him
neither
of
which
i
apprehend
my
good
friend
we
desire
should
be
the
case
of
our
sons
and
notwithstanding
our
author
professions
of
modesty
which
in
my
youth
i
have
heard
at
the
beginning
of
an
epilogue
i
can
not
agree
that
my
daughter
should
entertain
herself
with
some
of
his
pictures
which
i
do
not
expect
to
be
contemplated
without
emotion
unless
by
one
of
my
age
and
temper
who
can
see
the
girl
lie
on
her
back
with
one
arm
round
and
the
other
round
the
squire
naked
in
bed
with
his
hand
on
her
breasts
with
as
much
indifference
as
i
read
any
other
page
in
the
whole
novel
but
surely
this
and
some
other
descriptions
will
not
be
put
into
the
hands
of
his
daughter
by
any
wise
man
though
i
believe
it
will
be
difficult
for
him
to
keep
them
from
her
especially
if
the
clergy
in
town
have
cried
and
preached
it
up
as
you
say
but
my
friend
the
whole
narrative
is
such
a
misrepresentation
of
facts
such
a
perversion
of
truth
as
you
will
i
am
perswaded
agree
as
soon
as
you
have
perused
the
papers
i
now
inclose
to
you
that
i
hope
you
or
some
other
person
will
communicate
these
papers
to
the
publick
that
this
little
jade
may
not
impose
on
the
world
as
she
hath
on
her
master
the
true
name
of
this
wench
was
shamela
and
not
as
she
stiles
herself
her
father
had
in
his
youth
the
misfortune
to
appear
in
no
good
light
at
the
he
afterwards
served
in
the
capacity
of
a
drummer
in
one
of
the
regiments
in
the
service
where
being
drummed
out
he
came
over
to

turned

against
several
persons

becoming

obtain

whether
she
was

no

never

hath
put

into
a
great
hurry
of
spirits
for
you
have
a
very
difficult
part
to
act
i
hope
you
will
remember
your
slip
with
parson

not
be
guilty
of
any
more
such
folly
truly
a
girl
who
hath
once
known
what
is
what
is
in
the
highest
degree
inexcusable
if
she
respects
her
but
a
hint
of
this
is
sufficient
when
thinks
of
coming
to
town
i
believe
i
can
procure
her
a
good
house

fit
for
the

her

if
she
had

i
shall
never

if
you
upbraid

having

why
will
you
give
such
way
to
your
passion
how
could
you
imagine
i
should
be
such
a
simpleton
as
to
upbraid
thee
with
being
thy
mother
own
daughter
when
i
advised
you
not
to
be
guilty
of
folly
i
meant
no
more
than
that
you
should
take
care
to
be
well
paid
and
not
trust
to
promises
which
a
man
seldom
keeps
after
he
hath
had
his
wicked
will
and
seeing
you
have
a
rich
fool
to
deal
with
your
not
making
a
good
market
will
be
the
more
inexcusable
indeed
with
such
gentlemen
as
parson
there
is
more
to
be
said
for
they
have
nothing
to
give
and
are
commonly
otherwise
the
best
sort
of
men
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
read
good
books
pray
continue
so
to
do
i
have
inclosed
you
one
of
sermons
and
also
the
dealings
with
him
and
am

letter
vi
shamela

henrietta
maria
honora
andrews
o
madam
i
have
strange
things
to
tell
you
as
i
was
reading
in
that
charming
book
about
the
dealings
in
comes
my
master
to
be
sure
he
is
a
precious
one
says
he
what
book
is
that
i
warrant
you
no
forsooth
says
i
as
pertly
as
i
could
why
how
now
saucy
chops
boldface
says
he
mighty
pretty
words
says
i
pert
yes
says
he
you
are
a
d
d
impudent
stinking
cursed
confounded
jade
and
i
have
a
great
mind
to
kick
your
a
you
kiss
says
says
he
and
so
i
will
with
that
he
caught
me
in
his
arms
and
kissed
me
till
he
made
my
face
all
over
fire
now
this
served
purely
you
know
to
put
upon
the
fool
for
anger
o
what
precious
fools
men
are
and
so
i
flung
from
him
in
a
mighty
rage
and
pretended
as
how
i
would
go
out
at
the
door
but
when
i
came
to
the
end
of
the
room
i
stood
still
and
my
master
cryed
out
hussy
slut
saucebox
boldface
come
hither
yes
to
be
sure
says
i
why
do
you
come
says
he
what
should
i
come
for
says
i
if
you
do
come
to
me
i
come
to
you
says
he
i
come
to
you
i
assure
you
says
i
upon
which
he
run
up
caught
me
in
his
arms
and
flung
me
upon
a
chair
and
began
to
offer
to
touch
my
sir
says
i
you
had
better
not
offer
to
be
rude
well
says
he
no
more
i
wo
then
and
away
he
went
out
of
the
room
i
was
so
mad
to
be
sure
i
could
have
cry
what
a
prodigious
vexation
it
is
to
a
woman
to
be
made
a
fool
who
had
been
without
harkening
now
came
to
me
she
burst
into
a
violent
laugh
the
moment
she
came
in
well
says
she
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
i
have
reason
to
bless
myself
that
i
am
an
old
woman
ah
child
if
you
had
known
the
jolly
blades
of
my
age
you
would
not
have
been
left
in
the
lurch
in
this
manner
dear
says
i
do
laugh
at
one
and
to
be
sure
i
was
a
little
angry
with
come
says
she
my
dear
honeysuckle
i
have
one
game
to
play
for
you
he
shall
see
you
in
bed
he
shall
my
little
rosebud
he
shall
see
those
pretty
little
white
round
panting
and
offer
to
pull
off
my
fie
says
i
you
make
me
blush
and
upon
my
fackins
i
believe
she
did
she
went
on
thus
i
know
the
squire
likes
you
and
notwithstanding
the
aukwardness
of
his
proceeding
i
am
convinced
hath
some
hot
blood
in
his
veins
which
will
not
let
him
rest
he
hath
communicated
some
of
his
warmth
to
thee
my
little
angel
i
heard
him
last
night
at
our
door
trying
if
it
was
open
now
i
will
take
care
it
shall
be
so
i
warrant
that
he
makes
the
second
trial
which
if
he
doth
he
shall
find
us
ready
to
receive
him
i
will
at
first
counterfeit
sleep
and
after
a
swoon
so
that
he
will
have
you
naked
in
his
possession
and
then
if
you
are
disappointed
a
plague
of
all
young
squires
say
and
so
says
i
you
would
have
me
yield
myself
to
him
would
you
you
would
have
me
be
a
second
time
a
fool
for
nothing
thank
you
for
that
for
nothing
marry
forbid
says
she
you
know
he
hath
large
sums
of
money
besides
abundance
of
fine
things
and
do
you
think
when
you
have
inflamed
him
by
giving
his
hand
a
liberty
with
that
charming
person
and
that
you
know
he
may
easily
think
he
obtains
against
your
will
he
will
not
give
any
thing
to
come
at
all
this
will
not
do
answered
i
have
heard
my
mamma
say
and
so
you
know
madam
i
have
that
in
her
youth
fellows
have
often
taken
away
in
the
morning
what
they
gave
over
night
no
nothing
under
a
regular
taking
into
keeping
a
settled
settlement
for
me
and
all
my
heirs
all
my
whole
shall
do
the
business
or
else
is
the
word
faith
with
and
then
i
snapt
my
fingers
night
twelve
and
i
are
just
in
bed
and
the
door
unlocked
if
my
master
should
come
odsbobs
i
hear
him
just
coming
in
at
the
door
you
see
i
write
in
the
present
tense
as
parson
says
well
he
is
in
bed
between
us
we
both
shamming
a
sleep
he
steals
his
hand
into
my
bosom
which
i
as
if
in
my
sleep
press
close
to
me
with
mine
and
then
pretend
to
i
no
sooner
see
him
but
i
scream
out
to
she
feigns
likewise
but
just
to
come
to
herself
we
both
begin
she
to
becall
and
i
to
bescratch
very
liberally
after
having
made
a
pretty
free
use
of
my
fingers
without
any
great
regard
to
the
parts
i
attack
i
counterfeit
a
swoon
then
cries
out
o
sir
what
have
you
done
you
have
murthered
poor
she
is
gone
she
is
what
a
difficulty
it
is
to
keep
one
countenance
when
a
violent
laugh
desires
to
burst
the
poor
booby
frightned
out
of
his
wits
jumped
out
of
bed
and
in
his
shirt
sat
down
by
my
pale
and
trembling
for
the
moon
shone
and
i
kept
my
eyes
wide
open
and
pretended
to
fix
them
in
my
head
apply
lavender
water
and
hartshorn
and
this
for
a
full
half
hour
when
thinking
i
had
carried
it
on
long
enough
and
being
likewise
unable
to
continue
the
sport
any
longer
i
began
by
degrees
to
come
to
my
self
the
squire
who
had
sat
all
this
while
speechless
and
was
almost
really
in
that
condition
which
i
feigned
the
moment
he
saw
me
give
symptoms
of
recovering
my
senses
fell
down
on
his
knees
and
o
cryed
he
can
you
forgive
me
my
injured
maid
by
heaven
i
know
not
whether
you
are
a
man
or
a
woman
unless
by
your
swelling
breasts
will
you
promise
to
forgive
me
i
forgive
you
d
n
you
says
i
and
d
n
you
says
he
if
you
come
to
that
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
your
bold
face
saucy
sow
and
so
went
out
of
the
room
what
a
silly
fellow
is
a
bashful
young
lover
he
was
no
sooner
out
of
hearing
as
we
thought
than
we
both
burst
into
a
violent
laugh
well
says
i
never
saw
any
thing
better
acted
than
your
part
but
i
wish
you
may
not
have
discouraged
him
from
any
future
attempt
especially
since
his
passions
are
so
cool
that
you
could
prevent
his
hands
going
further
than
your
bosom
hang
him
answered
i
he
is
not
quite
so
cold
as
that
i
assure
you
our
hands
on
neither
side
were
idle
in
the
scuffle
nor
have
left
us
any
doubt
of
each
other
as
to
that
matter
my
master
sent
for
as
soon
as
he
was
up
and
bid
her
give
an
account
of
the
plate
and
linnen
in
her
care
and
told
her
he
was
resolved
that
both
she
and
the
little
gipsy
i
assure
him
should
set
out
together
made
him
a
saucy
answer
which
any
servant
of
spirit
you
know
would
tho
it
should
be
one
ruin
and
came
immediately
in
tears
to
me
crying
she
had
lost
her
place
on
my
account
and
that
she
should
be
forced
to
take
to
a
house
as
i
mentioned
before
and
that
she
hoped
i
would
at
least
make
her
all
the
amends
in
my
power
for
her
loss
on
my
account
and
come
to
her
house
whenever
i
was
sent
for
never
fear
says
i
i
warrant
we
are
not
so
near
being
turned
away
as
you
imagine
and
now
it
comes
into
my
head
i
have
a
fetch
for
him
and
you
shall
assist
me
in
it
but
it
being
now
late
and
my
letter
pretty
long
no
more
at
present
from
dutiful
shamela
letter
vii
lucretia
jervis
henrietta
maria
honora
andrews
miss
being
set
out
in
a
hurry
for
my
master
house
in
desired
me
to
acquaint
you
with
the
success
of
her
stratagem
which
was
to
dress
herself
in
the
plain
neatness
of
a
farmer
daughter
for
she
before
wore
the
cloaths
of
my
late
mistress
and
to
be
introduced
by
me
as
a
stranger
to
her
master
to
say
the
truth
she
became
the
dress
extremely
and
if
i
was
to
keep
a
house
a
thousand
years
i
would
never
desire
a
prettier
wench
in
it
as
soon
as
my
master
saw
her
he
immediately
threw
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
smothered
her
with
kisses
for
indeed
he
hath
but
very
little
to
say
for
himself
to
a
woman
he
swore
that
was
an
ugly
slut
pardon
dear
madam
the
coarseness
of
the
expression
compared
to
such
divine
excellence
he
added
he
would
turn
away
immediately
and
take
this
new
girl
whom
he
thought
to
be
one
of
his
tenant
daughters
in
her
room
miss
smiled
at
these
words
and
so
did
your
humble
servant
which
he
perceiving
looked
very
earnestly
at
your
fair
daughter
and
discovered
the
cheat
how
says
he
is
it
you
i
thought
sir
said
miss
after
what
had
happened
you
would
have
known
me
in
any
dress
no
hussy
says
he
but
after
what
hath
happened
i
should
know
thee
out
of
any
dress
from
all
thy
sex
he
then
was
what
we
women
call
rude
when
done
in
the
presence
of
others
but
it
seems
it
is
not
the
first
time
and
miss
defended
herself
with
great
strength
and
spirit
the
squire
who
thinks
her
a
pure
virgin
and
who
knows
nothing
of
my
character
resolved
to
send
her
into
on
pretence
of
conveying
her
home
where
our
old
friend
is
housekeeper
and
where
miss
had
her
small
one
by
parson
about
a
year
ago
this
is
a
piece
of
news
communicated
to
us
by
coachman
who
is
intrusted
by
his
master
to
carry
on
this
affair
privately
for
him
but
we
hang
together
i
believe
as
well
as
any
family
of
servants
in
the
nation
you
will
i
believe
madam
wonder
that
the
squire
who
doth
not
want
generosity
should
never
have
mentioned
a
settlement
all
this
while
i
believe
it
slips
his
memory
but
it
will
not
be
long
first
no
doubt
for
as
i
am
convinced
the
young
lady
will
do
nothing
unbecoming
your
daughter
nor
ever
admit
him
to
taste
her
charms
without
something
sure
and
handsome
so
i
am
certain
the
squire
will
never
rest
till
they
have
danced
and
kissing
dance
together
your
daughter
set
out
yesterday
morning
and
told
me
as
soon
as
she
arrived
you
might
depend
on
hearing
from
her
be
pleased
to
make
my
compliments
acceptable
to
and
and
and
all
friends
and
permit
me
the
honour
madam
to
be
with
the
utmost
sincerity
most
lucretia
jervis
if
the
squire
should
continue
his
displeasure
against
me
so
as
to
insist
on
the
warning
he
hath
given
me
you
will
see
me
soon
and
i
will
lodge
in
the
same
house
with
you
if
you
have
room
till
i
can
provide
for
my
self
to
my
liking

to
my
master
thank
her
for
that
she
will
find
two
words
go
to
that
bargain
the
day
after
my
arrival
here
i
received
a
letter
from
and
as
you
have
often
desired
to
see
one
from
him
i
have
inclosed
it
to
you
it
is
i
think
the
finest
i
ever
received
from
that
charming
man
and
full
of
a
great
deal
of
learning
what
a
brave
thing
it
is
to
be
a
schollard
and
to
be
able
to
talk
williams
pamela
andrews
having
learnt
by
means
of
my
clerk
who
yesternight
visited
the
with
my
commands
that
you
are
returned
into
this
county
i
purposed
to
have
saluted
your
fair
hands
this
day
towards
even
but
am
obliged
to
sojourn
this
night
at
a
neighbouring
clergyman
where
we
are
to
pierce
a
virgin
barrel
of
ale
in
a
cup
of
which
i
shall
not
be
unmindful
to
celebrate
your
health
i
hope
you
have
remembered
your
promise
to
bring
me
a
leaden
canister
of
tobacco
the
saffron
cut
for
in
troth
this
country
at
present
affords
nothing
worthy
the
replenishing
a
tube
some
i
tasted
the
other
day
at
an
alehouse
gave
me
the
i
filled
no
oftner
than
five
times
i
was
greatly
concerned
to
learn
that
your
late
lady
left
you
nothing
tho
i
can
not
say
the
tidings
much
surprized
me
for
i
am
too
intimately
acquainted
with
the
family
myself
father
and
grandfather
having
been
successive
incumbents
on
the
same
cure
which
you
know
is
in
their
gift
i
say
i
am
too
well
acquainted
with
them
to
expect
much
from
their
generosity
they
are
in
verity
as
worthless
a
family
as
any
other
whatever
the
young
gentleman
i
am
informed
is
a
perfect
reprobate
that
he
hath
an
to
every
species
of
vice
which
indeed
no
one
can
much
wonder
at
who
animadverts
on
that
want
of
respect
to
the
clergy
which
was
observable
in
him
when
a
child
i
remember
when
he
was
at
the
age
of
eleven
only
he
met
my
father
without
either
pulling
off
his
hat
or
riding
out
of
the
way
indeed
a
contempt
of
the
clergy
is
the
fashionable
vice
of
the
times
but
let
such
wretches
know
they
can
not
hate
detest
and
despise
us
half
so
much
as
we
do
them
however
i
have
prevailed
on
myself
to
write
a
civil
letter
to
your
master
as
there
is
a
probability
of
his
being
shortly
in
a
capacity
of
rendring
me
a
piece
of
service
my
good
friend
and
neighbour
the
being
as
i
am
informed
by
one
whom
i
have
employed
to
attend
for
that
purpose
very
near
his
dissolution
you
see
sweet
the
confidence
with
which
i
dictate
these
things
to
you
whom
after
those
endearments
which
have
passed
between
us
i
must
in
some
respects
estimate
as
my
wife
for
tho
the
omission
of
the
service
was
a
sin
yet
as
i
have
told
you
it
was
a
venial
one
of
which
i
have
truly
repented
as
i
hope
you
have
and
also
that
you
have
continued
the
wholsome
office
of
reading
good
books
and
are
improved
in
your
psalmody
of
which
i
shall
have
a
speedy
trial
for
i
purpose
to
give
you
a
sermon
next
and
shall
spend
the
evening
with
you
in
pleasures
which
tho
not
strictly
innocent
are
however
to
be
purged
away
by
frequent
and
sincere
repentance
i
am
pamela
faithful
arthur
williams
you
find
mamma
what
a
charming
way
he
hath
of
writing
and
yet
i
assure
you
that
is
not
the
most
charming
thing
belonging
to
him
for
tho
he
doth
not
put
any
dears
and
sweets
and
loves
into
his
letters
yet
he
says
a
thousand
of
them
for
he
can
be
as
fond
of
a
woman
as
any
man
living
women
are
great
fools
when
they
prefer
a
laced
coat
to
the
clergy
whom
it
is
our
duty
to
honour
and
well
on
parson
came
according
to
his
promise
and
an
excellent
sermon
he
preached
his
text
was
not
righteous
over
and
indeed
he
handled
it
in
a
very
fine
way
he
shewed
us
that
the
bible
doth
not
require
too
much
goodness
of
us
and
that
people
very
often
call
things
goodness
that
are
not
so
that
to
go
to
church
and
to
pray
and
to
sing
psalms
and
to
honour
the
clergy
and
to
repent
is
true
religion
and
is
not
doing
good
to
one
another
for
that
is
one
of
the
greatest
sins
we
can
commit
when
we
do
do
it
for
the
sake
of
religion
that
those
people
who
talk
of
vartue
and
morality
are
the
wickedest
of
all
persons
that
is
not
what
we
do
but
what
we
believe
that
must
save
us
and
a
great
many
other
good
things
i
wish
i
could
remember
them
all
as
soon
as
church
was
over
he
came
to
the
squire
house
and
drank
tea
with
and
me
after
which
went
out
and
left
us
together
for
an
hour
and
half
oh
he
is
a
charming
man
after
supper
he
went
home
and
then
began
to
catechize
me
about
my
familiarity
with
him
i
see
she
wants
him
herself
then
she
proceeded
to
tell
me
what
an
honour
my
master
did
me
in
liking
me
and
that
it
was
both
an
inexcusable
folly
and
pride
in
me
to
pretend
to
refuse
him
any
favour
pray
madam
says
i
consider
i
am
a
poor
girl
and
have
nothing
but
my
modesty
to
trust
to
if
i
part
with
that
what
will
become
of
me
methinks
says
she
you
are
not
so
mighty
modest
when
you
are
with
parson
i
have
observed
you
gloat
at
one
another
in
a
manner
that
hath
made
me
blush
i
assure
you
i
shall
let
the
squire
know
what
sort
of
man
he
is
you
may
do
your
will
says
i
as
long
as
he
hath
a
vote
for
the
squire
dares
do
nothing
to
offend
him
and
you
will
only
shew
that
you
are
jealous
of
him
and
that
all
how
now
mynx
says
she
mynx
no
more
mynx
than
yourself
says
i
with
that
she
hit
me
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
and
i
flew
at
her
and
scratched
her
face
she
went
crying
out
of
the
room
so
no
more
at
present
from
dutiful

o
mamma
rare
news
as
soon
as
i
was
up
this
morning
a
letter
was
brought
me
from
the
squire
of
which
i
send
you
a
copy
booby
pamela
i
hope
you
are
not
angry
with
me
for
the
deceit
put
upon
you
in
conveying
you
to
when
you
imagined
yourself
going
to
indeed
my
dear
i
can
not
live
without
you
and
will
very
shortly
come
down
and
convince
you
that
my
designs
are
better
than
you
imagine
and
such
as
you
may
with
honour
comply
with
i
am
dear
doating
booby
now
mamma
what
think
you
for
my
own
part
i
am
convinced
he
will
marry
me
and
faith
so
he
shall
o
bless
me
i
shall
be
and
be
mistress
of
a
great
estate
and
have
a
dozen
coaches
and
six
and
a
fine
house
at
and
another
at
and
servants
and
jewels
and
plate
and
go
to
plays
and
opera
and
court
and
do
what
i
will
and
spend
what
i
will
but
poor
parson
well
and
ca
i
see
parson
as
well
after
marriage
as
before
for
i
shall
never
care
a
farthing
for
my
husband
no
i
hate
and
despise
him
of
all
things
well
as
soon
as
i
had
read
my
letter
in
came
you
see
madam
says
she
i
carry
the
marks
of
your
passion
about
me
but
i
have
received
order
from
my
master
to
be
civil
to
you
and
i
must
obey
him
for
he
is
the
best
man
in
the
world
notwithstanding
your
treatment
of
him
my
treatment
of
him
madam
says
i
yes
says
she
your
insensibility
to
the
honour
he
intends
you
of
making
you
his
mistress
i
would
have
you
to
know
madam
i
would
not
be
mistress
to
the
greatest
king
no
nor
lord
in
the
universe
i
value
my
vartue
more
than
i
do
any
thing
my
master
can
give
me
and
so
we
talked
a
full
hour
and
a
half
about
my
vartue
and
i
was
afraid
at
first
she
had
heard
something
about
the
bantling
but
i
find
she
hath
not
she
is
as
jealous
and
suspicious
as
old
scratch
in
the
afternoon
i
stole
into
the
garden
to
meet
i
found
him
at
the
place
of
his
appointment
and
we
staid
in
a
kind
of
arbour
till
it
was
quite
dark
he
was
very
angry
when
i
told
him
what
had
threatned
let
him
refuse
me
the
living
says
he
if
he
dares
i
will
vote
for
the
other
party
and
not
only
so
but
will
expose
him
all
over
the
country
i
owe
him
indeed
but
i
do
care
for
that
by
that
time
the
election
is
past
i
shall
be
able
to
plead
the
of
i
could
have
stayed
with
the
dear
man
forever
but
when
it
grew
dark
he
told
me
he
was
to
meet
the
neighbouring
clergy
to
finish
the
barrel
of
ale
they
had
tapped
the
other
day
and
believed
they
should
not
part
till
three
or
four
in
the
morning
so
he
left
me
and
i
promised
to
be
penitent
and
go
on
with
my
reading
in
good
books
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
bethought
myself
what
excuse
i
should
make
to
and
it
came
into
my
head
to
pretend
as
how
i
intended
to
drown
myself
so
i
stript
off
one
of
my
petticoats
and
threw
it
into
the
canal
and
then
i
went
and
hid
myself
in
the
where
i
lay
all
night
and
comforted
myself
with
repeating
over
some
psalms
and
other
good
things
which
i
had
got
by
heart
in
the
morning
and
all
the
servants
were
frighted
out
of
their
wits
thinking
i
had
run
away
and
not
devising
how
they
should
answer
it
to
their
master
they
searched
all
the
likeliest
places
they
could
think
of
for
me
and
at
last
saw
my
petticoat
floating
in
the
pond
then
they
got
a
imagining
i
was
drowned
and
intending
to
drag
me
out
but
at
last
cook
coming
for
some
coals
discovered
me
lying
all
along
in
no
very
good
pickle
bless
me
says
she
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
i
do
know
says
i
help
me
up
and
i
will
go
in
to
breakfast
for
indeed
i
am
very
hungry
came
in
immediately
and
was
so
rejoyced
to
find
me
alive
that
she
asked
with
great
where
i
had
been
and
how
my
petticoat
came
into
the
pond
i
answered
i
believed
the
devil
had
put
it
into
my
head
to
drown
my
self
but
it
was
a
fib
for
i
never
saw
the
devil
in
my
life
nor
i
do
believe
he
hath
any
thing
to
do
with
me
so
much
for
this
matter
as
soon
as
i
had
breakfasted
a
coach
and
six
came
to
the
door
and
who
should
be
in
it
but
my
master
i
immediately
run
up
into
my
room
and
stript
and
washed
and
drest
my
self
as
well
as
i
could
and
put
on
my
prettiest
cap
and
pulled
down
my
stays
to
shew
as
much
as
i
could
of
my
bosom
for
parson
says
that
is
the
most
beautiful
part
of
a
woman
and
then
i
practised
over
all
my
airs
before
the
glass
and
then
i
sat
down
and
read
a
chapter
in
the
whole
duty
of
man
then
came
to
me
and
told
me
my
master
wanted
me
below
and
says
she
do
behave
like
a
fool
no
thinks
i
to
my
self
i
believe
i
shall
find
wit
enough
for
my
master
and
you
too
so
down
goes
me
i
into
the
parlour
to
him
says
he
the
moment
i
came
in
you
see
i
can
not
stay
long
from
you
which
i
think
is
a
sufficient
proof
of
the
violence
of
my
passion
yes
sir
says
i
i
see
your
honour
intends
to
ruin
me
that
nothing
but
the
destruction
of
my
vartue
will
content
you
what
a
charming
word
that
is
rest
his
soul
who
first
invented
how
can
you
say
i
would
ruin
you
answered
the
squire
when
you
shall
not
ask
any
thing
which
i
will
not
grant
you
if
that
be
true
says
i
good
your
honour
let
me
go
home
to
my
poor
but
honest
parents
that
is
all
i
have
to
ask
and
do
not
ruin
a
poor
maiden
who
is
resolved
to
carry
her
vartue
to
the
grave
with
her
hussy
says
he
do
provoke
me
do
provoke
me
i
say
you
are
absolutely
in
my
power
and
if
you
wo
let
me
lie
with
you
by
fair
means
i
will
by
force
o
la
sir
says
i
i
do
understand
your
paw
very
pretty
treatment
indeed
says
he
to
say
i
use
paw
words
hussy
gipsie
hypocrite
saucebox
boldface
get
out
of
my
sight
or
i
will
lend
you
such
a
kick
in
the
i
do
care
to
repeat
the
word
but
he
meant
my
hinder
part
i
was
offering
to
go
away
for
i
was
half
afraid
when
he
called
me
back
and
took
me
round
the
neck
and
kissed
me
and
then
bid
me
go
about
my
business
i
went
directly
into
my
room
where
came
to
me
soon
afterwards
so
madam
says
she
you
have
left
my
master
below
in
a
fine
pet
he
hath
threshed
two
or
three
of
his
men
already
it
is
might
pretty
that
all
his
servants
are
to
be
punished
for
your
impertinence
harkee
madam
says
i
do
you
affront
me
for
if
you
do
d
n
me
i
am
sure
i
have
repented
for
using
such
a
word
if
i
am
not
revenged
sweet
is
revenge
sure
the
sermon
book
is
in
the
right
in
calling
it
the
sweetest
morsel
the
devil
ever
dropped
into
the
mouth
of
a
remembered
the
smart
of
my
nails
too
well
to
go
farther
and
so
we
sat
down
and
talked
about
my
vartue
till
and
then
i
was
sent
for
to
wait
on
my
master
i
took
care
to
be
often
caught
looking
at
him
and
then
i
always
turn
away
my
eyes
and
pretended
to
be
ashamed
as
soon
as
the
cloth
was
removed
he
put
a
bumper
of
champagne
into
my
hand
and
bid
me
drink
o
la
i
ca
name
the
health
parson
may
well
say
he
is
a
wicked
man
took
a
glass
and
drank
the
dear
i
understand
that
word
but
i
believe
it
is
baudy
i
then
drank
towards
his
honour
good
pleasure
ay
hussy
says
he
you
can
give
me
pleasure
if
you
will
sir
says
i
i
shall
be
always
glad
to
do
what
is
in
my
power
and
so
i
pretended
not
to
know
what
he
meant
then
he
took
me
into
his
o
mamma
i
could
tell
you
something
if
i
would
and
he
kissed
me
and
i
said
i
wo
be
slobber
about
so
so
i
wo
and
he
bid
me
get
out
of
the
room
for
a
saucy
baggage
and
said
he
had
a
good
mind
to
spit
in
my
face
no
man
over
took
such
a
method
to
gain
a
woman
i
had
not
been
long
in
my
chamber
before
came
to
me
and
told
me
my
master
would
not
see
me
any
more
that
evening
that
is
if
he
can
help
it
for
added
she
i
easily
perceive
the
great
ascendant
you
have
over
him
and
to
confess
the
truth
i
do
doubt
but
you
will
shortly
be
my
mistress
what
says
i
dear
what
do
you
say
do
flatter
a
poor
girl
it
is
impossible
his
honour
can
have
any
honourable
design
upon
me
and
so
we
talked
of
honourable
designs
till
and
and
i
supped
together
upon
a
hot
buttered
and
about
ten
we
went
to
bed
we
had
not
been
a
bed
half
an
hour
when
my
master
came
pit
a
pat
into
the
room
in
his
shirt
as
before
i
pretended
not
to
hear
him
and
laid
hold
of
one
arm
and
he
pulled
down
the
bed
cloaths
and
came
into
bed
on
the
other
side
and
took
my
other
arm
and
laid
it
under
him
and
fell
a
kissing
one
of
my
breasts
as
if
he
would
have
devoured
it
i
was
then
forced
to
awake
and
began
to
struggle
with
him
crying
why
do
you
do
it
i
have
one
arm
secure
if
you
ca
deal
with
the
rest
i
am
sorry
for
you
he
was
as
rude
as
possible
to
me
but
i
remembered
mamma
the
instructions
you
gave
me
to
avoid
being
ravished
and
followed
them
which
soon
brought
him
to
terms
and
he
promised
me
on
quitting
my
hold
that
he
would
leave
the
bed
williams
little
are
all
the
men
in
the
world
compared
to
my
master
was
as
good
as
his
word
upon
which
said
o
sir
i
see
you
know
very
little
of
our
by
parting
so
easily
from
the
blessing
when
you
was
so
near
it
no
answered
he
i
am
very
glad
no
more
hath
happened
i
would
not
have
injured
for
the
world
and
morning
perhaps
she
may
hear
of
something
to
her
advantage
this
she
may
be
certain
of
that
i
will
never
take
her
by
force
and
then
he
left
the
room
what
think
you
now
says
are
you
not
yet
persuaded
my
master
hath
honourable
designs
i
think
he
hath
given
no
great
proof
of
them
said
i
your
experience
i
find
is
not
great
says
she
but
i
am
convinced
you
will
shortly
be
my
mistress
and
then
what
will
become
of
poor
me
with
such
sort
of
discourse
we
both
fell
asleep
next
morning
early
my
master
sent
for
me
and
after
kissing
me
gave
a
paper
into
my
hand
which
he
bid
me
read
i
did
so
and
found
it
to
be
a
proposal
for
settling
a
year
on
me
besides
several
other
advantagious
offers
as
presents
of
money
and
other
things
well
said
he
what
answer
do
you
make
me
to
this
sir
said
i
i
value
my
vartue
more
than
all
the
world
and
i
had
rather
be
the
poorest
wife
than
the
richest
man
whore
you
are
a
simpleton
said
he
that
may
be
and
yet
i
may
have
as
much
wit
as
some
folks
cry
i
meaning
me
i
suppose
said
he
every
man
knows
himself
best
says
hussy
says
he
get
out
of
the
room
and
let
me
see
your
saucy
face
no
more
for
i
find
i
am
in
more
danger
than
you
are
and
therefore
it
shall
be
my
business
to
avoid
you
as
much
as
i
can
and
it
shall
be
mine
thinks
i
at
every
turn
to
throw
my
self
in
your
way
so
i
went
out
and
as
i
parted
i
heard
him
sigh
and
say
he
was
bewitched
hath
been
with
me
since
and
she
assures
me
she
is
convinced
i
shall
shortly
be
mistress
of
the
family
and
she
really
behaves
to
me
as
if
she
already
thought
me
so
i
am
resolved
now
to
aim
at
it
i
thought
once
of
making
a
little
fortune
by
my
person
i
now
intend
to
make
a
great
one
by
my
vartue
so
asking
pardon
for
this
long
scroll
i
am
dutiful
shamela
letter
xi
henrietta
maria
honora
andrews
shamela
andrews
i
received
your
last
letter
with
infinite
pleasure
and
am
convinced
it
will
be
your
own
fault
if
you
are
not
married
to
your
master
and
i
would
advise
you
now
to
take
no
less
terms
but
my
dear
child
i
am
afraid
of
one
rock
only
that
parson
i
wish
he
was
out
of
the
way
a
woman
never
commits
folly
but
with
such
sort
of
men
as
by
many
hints
in
the
letters
i
collect
him
to
be
but
consider
my
dear
child
you
will
hereafter
have
opportunities
sufficient
to
indulge
yourself
with
parson
or
any
other
you
like
my
advice
therefore
to
you
is
that
you
would
avoid
seeing
him
any
more
till
the
knot
is
tied
remember
the
first
lesson
i
taught
you
that
a
married
woman
injures
only
her
husband
but
a
single
woman
herself
i
am
in
hopes
of
seeing
you
a
great
lady
affectionate
henrietta
maria
the
following
letter
seems
to
have
been
written
before
received
the
last
from
her
mother
letter
xii
shamela
andrews
henrietta
maria
honora
andrews
i
little
feared
when
i
sent
away
my
last
that
all
my
hopes
would
be
so
soon
frustrated
but
i
am
certain
you
will
blame
fortune
and
not
me
to
proceed
then
about
two
hours
after
i
had
left
the
squire
he
sent
for
me
into
the
parlour
said
he
and
takes
me
gently
by
the
hand
will
you
walk
with
me
in
the
garden
yes
sir
says
i
and
pretended
to
tremble
but
i
hope
your
honour
will
not
be
rude
indeed
says
he
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
and
i
have
something
to
tell
you
which
if
it
doth
not
please
you
can
not
offend
we
walked
out
together
and
he
began
thus
will
you
tell
me
truth
doth
the
resistance
you
make
to
my
attempts
proceed
from
vartue
only
or
have
i
not
some
rival
in
thy
dear
bosom
who
might
be
more
successful
sir
says
i
i
do
assure
you
i
never
had
a
thought
of
any
man
in
the
world
how
says
he
not
of
parson
parson
says
i
is
the
last
man
upon
earth
and
if
i
was
a
dutchess
and
your
honour
was
to
make
your
addresses
to
me
you
would
have
no
reason
to
be
jealous
of
any
rival
especially
such
a
fellow
as
parson
if
ever
i
had
a
liking
i
am
sure
but
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
one
way
and
no
riches
should
ever
bribe
me
the
other
my
dear
says
he
you
are
worthy
of
every
thing
and
suppose
i
should
lay
aside
all
considerations
of
fortune
and
disregard
the
censure
of
the
world
and
marry
you
o
sir
says
i
i
am
sure
you
can
have
no
such
thoughts
you
can
not
demean
your
self
so
low
upon
my
soul
i
am
in
earnest
says
he
o
pardon
me
sir
says
i
you
ca
persuade
me
of
this
how
mistress
says
he
in
a
violent
rage
do
you
give
me
the
lie
hussy
i
have
a
great
mind
to
box
your
saucy
ears
but
i
am
resolved
i
will
never
put
it
in
your
power
to
affront
me
again
and
therefore
i
desire
you
to
prepare
your
self
for
your
journey
this
instant
you
deserve
no
better
vehicle
than
a
cart
however
for
once
you
shall
have
a
chariot
and
it
shall
be
ready
for
you
within
this
half
hour
and
so
he
flung
from
me
in
a
fury
a
foolish
thing
it
is
for
a
woman
to
dally
too
long
with
her
lover
desires
how
many
have
owed
their
being
old
maids
to
their
holding
out
too
came
me
to
presently
and
told
me
i
must
make
ready
with
all
the
expedition
imaginable
for
that
my
master
had
ordered
the
chariot
and
that
if
i
was
not
prepared
to
go
in
it
i
should
be
turned
out
of
doors
and
left
to
find
my
way
home
on
foot
this
startled
me
a
little
yet
i
resolved
whether
in
the
right
or
wrong
not
to
submit
nor
ask
pardon
for
that
know
you
mamma
you
never
could
your
self
bring
me
to
from
my
childhood
besides
i
thought
he
would
be
no
more
able
to
master
his
passion
for
me
now
than
he
had
been
hitherto
and
if
he
sent
two
horses
away
with
me
i
concluded
he
would
send
four
to
fetch
me
back
so
truly
i
resolved
to
brazen
it
out
and
with
all
the
spirit
i
could
muster
up
i
told
i
was
vastly
pleased
with
the
news
she
brought
me
that
no
one
ever
went
more
readily
than
i
should
from
a
place
where
my
vartue
had
been
in
continual
danger
that
as
for
my
master
he
might
easily
get
those
who
were
fit
for
his
purpose
but
for
my
part
i
preferred
my
vartue
to
all
rakes
whatever
and
for
his
promises
and
his
offers
to
me
i
do
value
them
of
a
fig
not
of
a
fig
and
then
i
snapt
my
fingers
went
in
with
me
and
helped
me
to
pack
up
my
little
all
which
was
soon
done
being
no
more
than
two
two
five
shifts
one
sham
a
hoop
a
two
two
pair
of
stockings
one
odd
one
a
pair
of
lac
shoes
a
short
flowered
apron
a
lac
one
clog
and
almost
another
and
some
few
books
as
full
answer
to
a
plain
and
true
whole
duty
of
with
only
the
duty
to
one
neighbour
torn
out
the
third
volume
of
the
in
the
cloyster
or
the
nun
in
her
dealings
with
and
some
and
two
or
three
plays
with
their
titles
and
part
of
the
first
act
torn
off
so
as
soon
as
we
had
put
all
this
into
a
bundle
the
chariot
was
ready
and
i
took
leave
of
all
the
servants
and
particularly
who
pretended
i
believe
to
be
more
sorry
to
part
with
me
than
she
was
and
then
crying
out
with
an
air
of
indifference
my
service
to
my
master
when
he
condescends
to
enquire
after
me
i
flung
my
self
into
the
chariot
and
bid
drive
on
we
had
not
gone
far
before
a
man
on
horseback
riding
full
speed
overtook
us
and
coming
up
to
the
side
of
the
chariot
threw
a
letter
into
the
window
and
then
departed
without
uttering
a
single
syllable
i
immediately
knew
the
hand
of
my
dear
and
was
somewhat
surprised
tho
i
did
not
apprehend
the
contents
to
be
so
terrible
as
by
the
following
exact
copy
you
will
find
them
williams
pamela
pamela
that
disrespect
for
the
clergy
which
i
have
formerly
noted
to
you
in
that
villain
your
master
hath
now
broke
forth
in
a
manifest
fact
i
was
proceeding
to
my
neighbour
church
where
i
purposed
to
preach
a
funeral
sermon
on
the
death
of
the
exciseman
when
i
was
met
by
two
persons
who
are
it
seems
sheriffs
officers
and
arrested
for
the
which
your
master
had
lent
me
and
unless
i
can
find
bail
within
these
few
days
of
which
i
see
no
likelihood
i
shall
be
carried
to
goal
this
accounts
for
my
not
having
visited
you
these
two
days
which
you
might
assure
yourself
i
should
not
have
fail
if
the
had
not
been
wanting
if
you
can
by
any
means
prevail
on
your
master
to
release
me
i
beseech
you
so
to
do
not
scrupling
any
thing
for
righteousness
sake
i
hear
he
is
just
arrived
in
this
country
i
have
herewith
sent
him
a
letter
of
which
i
transmit
you
a
copy
so
with
prayers
for
your
success
i
subscribe
myself
affectionate
arthur
williams
williams
squire
booby
i
am
justly
surprized
to
feel
so
heavy
a
weight
of
your
displeasure
without
being
conscious
of
the
least
demerit
towards
so
good
and
generous
a
patron
as
i
have
ever
found
you
for
my
own
part
i
can
truly
say
conscire
sibi
nullæ
pallescere
and
therefore
as
this
proceeding
is
so
contrary
to
your
usual
goodness
which
i
have
often
experienced
and
more
especially
in
the
loan
of
this
money
for
which
i
am
now
arrested
i
can
not
avoid
thinking
some
malicious
persons
have
insinuated
false
suggestions
against
me
intending
thereby
to
eradicate
those
seeds
of
affection
which
i
have
hardly
travailed
to
sowe
in
your
heart
and
which
promised
to
produce
such
excellent
fruit
if
i
have
any
ways
offended
you
sir
be
graciously
pleased
to
let
me
know
it
and
likewise
to
point
out
to
me
the
means
whereby
i
may
reinstate
myself
in
your
favour
for
next
to
him
whom
the
great
themselves
must
bow
down
before
i
know
none
to
whom
i
shall
bend
with
more
lowliness
than
your
honour
permit
me
to
subscribe
myself
most
obedient
and
most
most
dutiful
humble
arthur
williams
the
fate
of
poor
shocked
me
more
than
my
own
for
as
the
says
moves
one
so
much
as
a
great
man
in
and
to
see
a
man
of
his
learning
forced
to
submit
so
low
to
one
whom
i
have
often
heard
him
say
he
despises
is
i
think
a
most
affecting
circumstance
i
write
all
this
to
you
dear
mamma
at
the
inn
where
i
lie
this
first
night
and
as
i
shall
send
it
immediately
by
the
post
it
will
be
in
town
a
little
before
do
let
my
coming
away
vex
you
for
as
my
master
will
be
in
town
in
a
few
days
i
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
him
and
let
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
i
shall
be
sure
of
my
settlement
at
last
which
is
all
from
dutiful
shamela
just
as
i
was
going
to
send
this
away
a
letter
is
come
from
my
master
desiring
me
to
return
with
a
large
number
of
i
have
him
now
as
sure
as
a
gun
as
you
will
perceive
by
the
letter
itself
which
i
have
inclosed
to
you
this
letter
is
unhappily
lost
as
well
as
the
next
which
wrote
and
which
contained
an
account
of
all
the
proceedings
previous
to
her
marriage
the
only
remaining
one
which
i
could
preserve
seems
to
have
been
written
about
a
week
after
the
ceremony
was
perform
and
is
as
follows
shamela
booby
henrietta
maria
honora
andrews
in
my
last
i
left
off
at
our
sitting
down
to
supper
on
our
wedding
night
where
i
behaved
with
as
much
bashfulness
as
the
purest
virgin
in
the
world
could
have
done
the
most
difficult
task
for
me
was
to
blush
however
by
holding
my
breath
and
squeezing
my
cheeks
with
my
handkerchief
i
did
pretty
well
my
husband
was
extreamly
eager
and
impatient
to
have
supper
removed
after
which
he
gave
me
leave
to
retire
into
my
closet
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
which
was
very
agreeable
to
me
for
i
employed
that
time
in
writing
to
who
as
i
informed
you
in
my
last
is
released
and
presented
to
the
living
upon
the
death
of
the
last
parson
well
at
last
i
went
to
bed
and
my
husband
soon
leap
in
after
me
where
i
shall
only
assure
you
i
acted
my
part
in
such
a
manner
that
no
bridegroom
was
ever
better
satisfied
with
his
bride
virginity
and
to
confess
the
truth
i
might
have
been
well
enough
satisfied
too
if
i
had
never
been
acquainted
with
parson
what
regard
men
who
marry
widows
should
have
to
the
qualifications
of
their
former
we
did
not
rise
the
next
morning
till
eleven
and
then
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
i
eat
two
slices
of
bread
and
butter
and
drank
three
dishes
of
tea
with
a
good
deal
of
sugar
and
we
both
look
very
silly
after
breakfast
we
drest
our
selves
he
in
a
blue
camblet
coat
very
richly
lac
and
breeches
of
the
same
with
a
paduafoy
waistcoat
laced
with
silver
and
i
in
one
of
my
mistress
gowns
i
will
have
finer
when
i
come
to
town
we
then
took
a
walk
in
the
garden
and
he
kissed
me
several
times
and
made
me
a
present
of
guineas
which
i
gave
away
before
night
to
the
servants
twenty
to
one
and
ten
to
another
and
so
on
we
eat
a
very
hearty
dinner
and
about
eight
in
the
evening
went
to
bed
again
he
is
prodigiously
fond
of
me
but
i
do
like
him
half
so
well
as
my
dear
the
next
morning
we
rose
earlier
and
i
asked
him
for
another
hundred
guineas
and
he
gave
them
me
i
sent
fifty
to
parson
and
the
rest
i
gave
away
two
guineas
to
a
beggar
and
three
to
a
man
riding
along
the
road
and
the
rest
to
other
people
i
long
to
be
in
that
i
may
have
an
opportunity
of
laying
some
out
as
well
as
giving
away
i
believe
i
shall
buy
every
thing
i
see
what
signifies
having
money
if
one
doth
not
spend
it
the
next
day
as
soon
as
i
was
up
i
asked
him
for
another
hundred
why
my
dear
says
he
i
do
grudge
you
any
thing
but
how
was
it
possible
for
you
to
lay
out
the
other
two
hundred
here
la
sir
says
i
i
hope
i
am
not
obliged
to
give
you
an
account
of
every
shilling
troth
that
will
be
being
your
servant
still
i
assure
you
i
married
you
with
no
such
view
besides
did
not
you
tell
me
i
should
be
mistress
of
your
estate
and
i
will
be
too
for
tho
i
brought
no
fortune
i
am
as
much
your
wife
as
if
i
had
brought
a
million
yes
but
my
dear
says
he
if
you
had
brought
a
million
you
would
spend
it
all
at
this
rate
besides
what
will
your
expences
be
in
if
they
are
so
great
here
truly
says
i
sir
i
shall
live
like
other
ladies
of
my
fashion
and
if
you
think
because
i
was
a
servant
that
i
shall
be
contented
to
be
governed
as
you
please
i
will
shew
you
you
are
mistaken
if
you
had
not
cared
to
marry
me
you
might
have
let
it
alone
i
did
not
ask
you
nor
i
did
not
court
you
madam
says
he
i
do
value
a
hundred
guineas
to
oblige
you
but
this
is
a
spirit
which
i
did
not
expect
in
you
nor
did
i
ever
see
any
symptoms
of
it
before
o
but
times
are
altered
now
i
am
your
lady
sir
yes
to
my
sorrow
says
he
i
am
afraid
and
i
am
afraid
to
my
sorrow
too
for
if
you
begin
to
use
me
in
this
manner
already
i
reckon
you
will
beat
me
before
a
month
at
an
end
i
am
sure
if
you
did
it
would
injure
me
less
than
this
barbarous
treatment
upon
which
i
burst
into
tears
and
pretended
to
fall
into
a
fit
this
frighted
him
out
of
his
wits
and
he
called
up
the
servants
immediately
came
in
and
she
and
another
of
the
maids
fell
heartily
to
rubbing
my
temples
and
holding
to
my
nose
told
him
she
fear
i
should
never
recover
upon
which
he
began
to
beat
his
breasts
and
cried
out
o
my
dearest
angel
curse
on
my
passionate
temper
i
have
destroy
her
i
have
destroy
her
would
she
had
spent
my
whole
estate
rather
than
this
had
happened
speak
to
me
my
love
i
will
melt
myself
into
gold
for
thy
pleasure
at
last
having
pretty
well
tired
my
self
with
counterfeiting
and
imagining
i
had
continu
long
enough
for
my
purpose
in
the
sham
fit
i
began
to
move
my
eyes
to
loosen
my
teeth
and
to
open
my
hands
which
no
sooner
perceived
than
he
embraced
and
kissed
me
with
the
eagerest
extacy
asked
my
pardon
on
his
knees
for
what
i
had
suffered
through
his
folly
and
perverseness
and
without
more
questions
fetched
me
the
money
i
fancy
i
have
effectually
prevented
any
farther
refusals
or
inquiry
into
my
expences
it
would
be
hard
indeed
that
a
woman
who
marries
a
man
only
for
his
money
should
be
debarred
from
spending
it
well
after
all
things
were
quiet
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
yet
i
resolved
not
to
smile
once
nor
to
say
one
or
word
on
any
account
can
be
more
prudent
in
a
wife
than
a
sullen
backwardness
to
reconciliation
it
makes
a
husband
fearful
of
offending
by
the
length
of
his
when
we
were
drest
the
coach
was
by
my
desire
ordered
for
an
airing
which
we
took
in
it
a
long
silence
prevailed
on
both
sides
tho
he
constantly
squeezed
my
hand
and
kissed
me
and
used
other
familiarities
which
i
peevishly
permitted
at
last
i
opened
my
mouth
and
so
says
i
you
are
sorry
you
are
married
pray
my
dear
says
he
forget
what
i
said
in
a
passion
passion
says
i
is
apter
to
discover
our
thoughts
than
to
teach
us
to
counterfeit
well
says
he
whether
you
will
believe
me
or
no
i
solemnly
vow
i
would
not
change
thee
for
the
richest
woman
in
the
universe
no
i
warrant
you
says
i
and
yet
you
could
refuse
me
a
nasty
hundred
pound
at
these
very
words
i
saw
riding
as
fast
as
he
could
across
a
field
and
i
looked
out
and
saw
a
lease
of
greyhounds
coursing
a
hare
which
they
presently
killed
and
i
saw
him
alight
and
take
it
from
them
my
husband
ordered
to
drive
towards
him
and
looked
horribly
out
of
humour
which
i
presently
imputed
to
jealousy
so
i
began
with
him
first
for
that
is
the
wisest
way
la
sir
says
i
what
makes
you
look
so
angry
and
grim
doth
the
sight
of
give
you
all
this
uneasiness
i
am
sure
i
would
never
have
married
a
woman
of
whom
i
had
so
bad
an
opinion
that
i
must
be
uneasy
at
every
fellow
she
looks
at
my
dear
answer
he
you
injure
me
extremely
you
was
not
in
my
thoughts
nor
indeed
could
be
while
they
were
covered
by
so
morose
a
countenance
i
am
justly
angry
with
that
parson
whose
family
hath
been
raised
from
the
dunghill
by
ours
and
who
hath
received
from
me
twenty
kindnesses
and
yet
is
not
contented
to
destroy
the
game
in
all
other
places
which
i
freely
give
him
leave
to
do
but
hath
the
impudence
to
pursue
a
few
hares
which
i
am
desirous
to
preserve
round
about
this
little
coppice
look
my
dear
pray
look
says
he
i
believe
he
is
going
to
turn
higler
to
confess
the
truth
he
had
no
less
than
three
ty
up
behind
his
horse
and
a
fourth
he
held
in
his
hand
pshaw
says
i
i
wish
all
the
hares
in
the
country
were
d
d
the
parson
himself
chid
me
afterwards
for
using
the
word
tho
it
was
in
his
service
here
a
fuss
indeed
about
a
nasty
little
pitiful
creature
that
is
not
half
so
useful
as
a
cat
you
shall
not
persuade
me
that
a
man
of
your
understanding
would
quarrel
with
a
clergyman
for
such
a
trifle
no
no
i
am
the
hare
for
whom
poor
parson
is
persecuted
and
jealousy
is
the
motive
if
you
had
married
one
of
your
quality
ladies
she
would
have
had
lovers
by
dozens
she
would
so
but
because
you
have
taken
a
forsooth
you
are
jealous
if
she
but
looks
and
then
i
began
to
water
at
a
poor
p
a
a
rson
in
his
pu
u
u
lpit
and
then
out
burst
a
flood
of
tears
my
dear
said
he
for
heaven
sake
dry
your
eyes
and
do
let
him
be
a
witness
of
your
tears
which
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
might
be
imputed
to
my
unkindness
i
have
already
given
you
some
proofs
that
i
am
not
jealous
of
this
parson
i
will
now
give
you
a
very
strong
one
for
i
will
mount
my
horse
and
you
shall
take
into
the
coach
you
may
be
sure
this
motion
pleased
me
yet
i
pretended
to
make
as
light
of
it
as
possible
and
told
him
i
was
sorry
his
behaviour
had
made
some
such
glaring
instance
necessary
to
the
perfect
clearing
my
character
he
soon
came
up
to
who
had
attempted
to
ride
off
but
was
prevented
by
one
of
our
horsemen
whom
my
husband
sent
to
stop
him
when
we
met
my
husband
asked
him
how
he
did
with
a
very
air
and
told
him
he
perceived
he
had
found
good
sport
that
morning
he
answered
pretty
moderate
sir
for
that
he
had
found
the
three
hares
tied
on
to
the
saddle
dead
in
a
ditch
winking
on
me
at
the
same
time
and
added
he
was
sorry
there
was
such
a
rot
among
them
well
says
if
you
please
you
shall
come
in
and
ride
with
my
wife
for
my
own
part
i
will
mount
on
horseback
for
it
is
fine
weather
and
besides
it
doth
not
become
me
to
loll
in
a
chariot
whilst
a
clergyman
rides
on
horseback
at
which
words
leap
out
and
leap
in
in
an
instant
telling
my
husband
as
he
mounted
he
was
glad
to
see
such
a
reformation
and
that
if
he
continued
his
respect
to
the
clergy
he
might
assure
himself
of
blessings
from
above
it
was
now
that
the
airing
began
to
grow
pleasant
to
me
who
never
had
but
one
fault
that
he
generally
smells
of
tobacco
was
now
perfectly
sweet
for
he
had
for
two
days
together
enjoined
himself
as
a
penance
not
to
smoke
till
he
had
kissed
my
lips
i
will
loosen
you
from
that
obligation
says
i
and
observing
my
husband
looking
another
way
i
gave
him
a
charming
kiss
and
then
he
asked
me
questions
concerning
my
this
actually
made
me
blush
i
vow
i
did
not
think
it
had
been
in
him
as
he
went
along
he
began
to
discourse
very
learnedly
and
told
me
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
were
too
distinct
matters
which
had
not
the
least
relation
to
each
other
that
all
immaterial
substances
those
were
his
very
words
such
as
love
desire
and
so
forth
were
guided
by
the
spirit
but
fine
houses
large
estates
coaches
and
dainty
entertainments
were
the
product
of
the
flesh
therefore
says
he
my
dear
you
have
two
husbands
one
the
object
of
your
love
and
to
satisfy
your
desire
the
other
the
object
of
your
necessity
and
to
furnish
you
with
those
other
conveniences
i
am
sure
i
remember
every
word
for
he
repeated
it
three
times
o
he
is
very
good
whenever
i
desire
him
to
repeat
a
thing
to
me
three
times
he
always
doth
it
as
then
the
spirit
is
preferable
to
the
flesh
so
am
i
preferable
to
your
other
husband
to
whom
i
am
antecedent
in
time
likewise
i
say
these
things
my
dear
said
he
to
satisfie
your
conscience
a
fig
for
my
conscience
said
i
when
shall
i
meet
you
again
in
the
garden
my
husband
now
rode
up
to
the
chariot
and
asked
us
how
we
did
i
hate
the
sight
of
him
answered
very
well
at
your
service
they
then
talked
of
the
weather
and
other
things
i
wished
him
gone
again
every
minute
but
all
in
vain
i
had
no
more
opportunity
of
conversing
with
well
at
dinner
was
very
civil
to
and
told
him
he
was
sorry
for
what
had
happened
and
would
make
him
sufficient
amends
if
in
his
power
and
desired
him
to
accept
of
a
note
for
fifty
pounds
which
he
was
so
to
receive
notwithstanding
all
that
had
past
and
told
he
hop
he
would
be
forgiven
and
that
he
would
pray
for
him
we
make
a
charming
fool
of
him
times
are
finely
altered
i
have
entirely
got
the
better
of
him
and
am
resolved
never
to
give
him
his
humour
how
foolish
it
is
in
a
woman
who
hath
once
got
the
reins
into
her
own
hand
ever
to
quit
them
after
dinner
drank
the
church
and
smiled
on
me
when
my
husband
turn
came
he
drank
and
the
church
for
which
he
was
very
severely
rebuked
by
it
being
a
high
crime
it
seems
to
name
any
thing
before
the
church
i
do
not
know
what
is
but
i
believe
it
is
something
concerning
chusing
pallament
men
for
i
asked
if
it
was
not
a
health
to
borough
and
with
a
hearty
laugh
answered
yes
yes
it
is
his
borough
we
mean
i
slipt
out
as
soon
as
i
could
hoping
would
finish
the
squire
as
i
have
heard
him
say
he
could
easily
do
and
come
to
me
but
it
happened
quite
otherwise
for
in
about
half
an
hour
came
to
me
and
told
me
he
had
left
the
mayor
of
his
borough
and
two
or
three
aldermen
heartily
at
it
and
asked
me
if
i
would
go
hear
sing
a
catch
which
added
he
he
doth
to
a
miracle
every
opportunity
of
seeing
my
dear
was
agreeable
to
me
which
indeed
i
scarce
had
at
this
time
for
when
we
returned
the
whole
corporation
were
got
together
and
the
room
was
in
a
cloud
of
tobacco
parson
was
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
and
he
hath
pure
round
cherry
cheeks
and
his
face
look
all
the
world
to
nothing
like
the
sun
in
a
fog
if
the
sun
had
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
there
would
be
no
difference
i
began
now
to
grow
uneasy
apprehending
i
should
have
no
more
of
company
that
evening
and
not
at
all
caring
for
my
husband
i
advised
him
to
sit
down
and
drink
for
his
country
with
the
rest
of
the
company
but
he
refused
and
desired
me
to
give
him
some
tea
swearing
nothing
made
him
so
sick
as
to
hear
a
parcel
of
scoundrels
roaring
forth
the
principles
of
honest
men
over
their
cups
when
says
he
i
know
most
of
them
are
such
empty
blockheads
that
they
do
know
their
right
hand
from
their
left
and
that
fellow
there
who
hath
talked
so
much
of
at
the
left
side
of
the
parson
in
whom
they
all
place
a
confidence
if
i
do
take
care
will
sell
them
to
my
adversary
i
do
know
why
i
mention
this
stuff
to
you
for
i
am
sure
i
know
nothing
about
more
than
parson
tells
me
who
says
that
the
are
in
the
right
o
and
that
every
christian
ought
to
be
on
the
same
with
the
bishops
when
we
had
finished
our
tea
we
walked
in
the
garden
till
it
was
dark
and
then
my
husband
proposed
instead
of
returning
to
the
company
which
i
desired
that
i
might
see
parson
again
to
sup
in
another
room
by
our
selves
which
for
fear
of
making
him
jealous
and
considering
too
that
parson
would
be
pretty
far
gone
i
was
obliged
to
consent
to
what
a
devilish
thing
it
is
for
a
woman
to
be
obliged
to
go
to
bed
to
a
young
squire
she
doth
not
like
when
there
is
a
jolly
parson
in
the
same
house
she
is
fond
in
the
morning
i
grew
very
peevish
and
in
the
dumps
notwithstanding
all
he
could
say
or
do
to
please
me
i
exclaimed
against
the
priviledge
of
husbands
and
vowed
i
would
not
be
pulled
and
tumbled
about
at
last
he
hit
on
the
only
method
which
could
have
brought
me
into
humour
and
proposed
to
me
a
journey
to
within
a
few
days
this
you
may
easily
guess
pleased
me
for
besides
the
desire
which
i
have
of
shewing
my
self
forth
of
buying
fine
cloaths
jewels
coaches
houses
and
ten
thousand
other
fine
things
parson
is
it
seems
going
thither
too
to
be
what
a
charming
journey
i
shall
have
for
i
hope
to
keep
the
dear
man
in
the
chariot
with
me
all
the
way
and
that
foolish
booby
for
that
is
the
name
williams
set
him
will
ride
on
so
as
i
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
you
so
shortly
i
think
i
will
mention
no
more
matters
to
you
now
o
i
had
like
to
have
forgot
one
very
material
thing
which
is
that
it
will
look
horribly
for
a
lady
of
my
quality
and
fashion
to
own
such
a
woman
as
you
for
my
mother
therefore
we
must
meet
in
private
only
and
if
you
will
never
claim
me
nor
mention
me
to
any
one
i
will
always
allow
you
what
is
very
handsome
parson
hath
greatly
advised
me
in
this
and
says
he
thinks
i
should
do
very
well
to
lay
out
twenty
pounds
and
set
you
up
in
a
little
chandler
shop
but
you
must
remember
all
my
favours
to
you
will
depend
on
your
secrecy
for
i
am
positively
resolved
i
will
not
be
known
to
be
your
daughter
and
if
you
tell
any
one
so
i
shall
deny
it
with
all
my
might
which
parson
says
i
may
do
with
a
safe
conscience
being
now
a
married
woman
so
i
rest
humble
shamela
the
strangest
fancy
hath
enter
into
my
booby
head
that
can
be
imagined
he
is
resolved
to
have
a
book
made
about
him
and
me
he
proposed
it
to
and
offered
him
a
reward
for
his
pains
but
he
says
he
never
writ
any
thing
of
that
kind
but
will
recommend
my
husband
when
he
comes
to
town
to
a
parson
does
that
sort
of
business
for
one
who
can
make
my
husband
and
me
and
parson
to
be
all
great
people
for
he
make
black
it
seems
well
but
they
say
my
name
is
to
be
altered
says
the
first
syllabub
hath
too
comical
a
sound
so
it
is
to
be
changed
into
i
own
i
ca
imagine
what
can
be
said
for
to
be
sure
i
sha
confess
any
of
my
secrets
to
them
and
so
i
whispered
parson
about
that
who
answered
me
i
need
not
give
my
self
any
trouble
for
the
gentleman
writes
never
asked
more
than
a
few
names
of
his
customers
and
that
he
made
all
the
rest
out
of
his
own
head
you
mistake
child
said
he
if
you
apprehend
any
truths
are
to
be
delivered
so
far
on
the
contrary
if
you
had
not
been
acquainted
with
the
name
you
would
not
have
known
it
to
be
your
own
history
i
have
seen
a
of
his
where
the
person
whose
life
was
written
could
he
have
risen
from
the
dead
again
would
not
have
even
suspected
he
had
been
aimed
at
unless
by
the
title
of
the
book
which
was
superscribed
with
his
name
well
all
these
matters
are
strange
to
me
yet
i
ca
help
laughing
to
think
i
shall
see
my
self
in
a
printed
book
so
much
for
or
which
i
have
taken
pains
to
transcribe
from
the
originals
sent
down
by
her
mother
in
a
rage
at
the
proposal
in
her
last
letter
the
originals
themselves
are
in
my
hands
and
shall
be
communicated
to
you
if
you
think
proper
to
make
them
publick
and
certainly
they
will
have
their
use
the
character
of
will
make
young
gentlemen
wary
how
they
take
the
most
fatal
step
both
to
themselves
and
families
by
youthful
hasty
and
improper
matches
indeed
they
may
assure
themselves
that
all
such
prospects
of
happiness
are
vain
and
delusive
and
that
they
sacrifice
all
the
solid
comforts
of
their
lives
to
a
very
transient
satisfaction
of
a
passion
which
how
hot
so
ever
it
be
will
be
soon
cooled
and
when
cooled
will
afford
them
nothing
but
repentance
can
any
thing
be
more
miserable
than
to
be
despised
by
the
whole
world
and
that
must
certainly
be
the
consequence
to
be
despised
by
the
person
obliged
which
it
is
more
than
probable
will
be
the
consequence
and
of
which
we
see
an
instance
in
and
lastly
to
despise
one
self
which
must
be
the
result
of
any
reflection
on
so
weak
and
unworthy
a
choice
as
to
the
character
of
parson
i
am
sorry
it
is
a
true
one
indeed
those
who
do
not
know
him
will
hardly
believe
it
so
but
what
scandal
doth
it
throw
on
the
order
to
have
one
bad
member
unless
they
endeavour
to
screen
and
protect
him
in
him
you
see
a
picture
of
almost
every
vice
exposed
in
nauseous
and
odious
colours
and
if
a
clergyman
would
ask
me
by
what
pattern
he
should
form
himself
i
would
say
be
the
reverse
of
so
far
therefore
he
may
be
of
use
to
the
clergy
themselves
and
though
god
forbid
there
should
be
many
amongst
them
you
and
i
are
too
honest
to
pretend
that
the
body
wants
no
reformation
to
say
the
truth
i
think
no
greater
instance
of
the
contrary
can
be
given
than
that
which
appears
in
your
letter
the
confederating
to
cry
up
a
nonsensical
ridiculous
book
i
believe
the
most
extensively
so
of
any
ever
yet
published
and
to
be
so
weak
and
so
wicked
as
to
pretend
to
make
it
a
matter
of
religion
whereas
so
far
from
having
any
moral
tendency
the
book
is
by
no
means
innocent
for
there
are
many
lascivious
images
in
it
very
improper
to
be
laid
before
the
youth
of
either
sex
young
gentlemen
are
here
taught
that
to
marry
their
chambermaids
and
to
indulge
the
passion
of
lust
at
the
expence
of
reason
and
common
sense
is
an
act
of
religion
virtue
and
honour
and
indeed
the
surest
road
to
happiness
all
chambermaids
are
strictly
enjoyned
to
look
out
after
their
masters
they
are
taught
to
use
little
arts
to
that
purpose
and
lastly
are
countenanced
in
impertinence
to
their
superiors
and
in
betraying
the
secrets
of
families
in
the
character
of
vice
is
rewarded
whence
every
housekeeper
may
learn
the
usefulness
of
pimping
and
bawding
for
her
master
in
parson
who
is
represented
as
a
faultless
character
we
see
a
busy
fellow
intermeddling
with
the
private
affairs
of
his
patron
whom
he
is
very
ungratefully
forward
to
expose
and
condemn
on
every
occasion
many
more
objections
might
if
i
had
time
or
inclination
be
made
to
this
book
but
i
apprehend
what
hath
been
said
is
sufficient
to
persuade
you
of
the
use
which
may
arise
from
publishing
an
antidote
to
this
poison
i
have
therefore
sent
you
the
copies
of
these
papers
and
if
you
have
leisure
to
communicate
them
to
the
press
i
will
transmit
you
the
originals
tho
i
assure
you
the
copies
are
exact
i
shall
only
add
that
there
is
not
the
least
foundation
for
any
thing
which
is
said
of
lady
or
any
of
the
other
ladies
all
that
is
merely
to
be
imputed
to
the
invention
of
the
biographer
i
have
particularly
enquired
after
lady
and
dont
hear
hath
such
a
relation
or
that
there
is
indeed
any
such
person
existing
i
am
faithfully

humble
oliver

oliver
i
have
read
over
the
history
of
as
it
appears
in
those
authentick
copies
you
favour
me
with
and
am
very
much
ashamed
of
the
character
which
i
was
hastily
prevailed
on
to
give
that
book
i
am
equally
angry
with
the
pert
jade
herself
and
with
the
author
of
her
life
for
i
scarce
know
yet
to
whom
i
chiefly
owe
an
imposition
which
hath
been
so
general
that
if
numbers
could
defend
me
from
shame
i
should
have
no
reason
to
apprehend
it
as
i
have
your
implied
leave
to
publish
what
you
so
kindly
sent
me
i
shall
not
wait
for
the
originals
as
you
assure
me
the
copies
are
exact

as
i
am
really
impatient
to
do
what
i
think
a
serviceable
act
of
justice
to
the
world
finding
by
the
end
of
her
last
letter
that
the

made
it
pretty
much
my
business
to
enquire
after
her

with
no
effect
hitherto
as
soon
as
i
succeed
in
this
enquiry
you
shall
hear
what
discoveries
i
can
learn
you
will
pardon
the
shortness
of
this
letter
as
you
shall
be
troubled
with
a
much
longer
very
soon

most
