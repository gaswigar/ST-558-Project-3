the
mountain
home
far
up
on
the
the
little
shack
stood
alone
in
the
clearing
it
was
roughly
yet
warmly
built
behind
it
jagged
cliffs
broke
the
north
wind
and
towered
in
the
sunshine
before
it
a
tiny
expanse
of
green
sloped
gently
away
to
a
point
where
the
mountain
dropped
in
another
sharp
descent
wooded
with
scrubby
firs
and
pines
at
the
left
a
footpath
led
into
the
cool
depths
of
the
forest
but
at
the
right
the
mountain
fell
away
again
and
disclosed
to
view
the
picture
david
loved
the
best
of
all
the
valley
the
silver
pool
of
the
lake
with
its
ribbon
of
a
river
flung
far
out
and
above
it
the
grays
and
greens
and
purples
of
the
mountains
that
climbed
one
upon
shoulders
until
the
topmost
thrust
their
heads
into
the
wide
dome
of
the
sky
itself
there
was
no
road
apparently
leading
away
from
the
cabin
there
was
only
the
footpath
that
disappeared
into
the
forest
neither
anywhere
was
there
a
house
in
sight
nearer
than
the
white
specks
far
down
in
the
valley
by
the
river
within
the
shack
a
wide
fireplace
dominated
one
side
of
the
main
room
it
was
june
now
and
the
ashes
lay
cold
on
the
hearth
but
from
the
tiny
in
the
rear
came
the
smell
and
the
sputter
of
bacon
sizzling
over
a
blaze
the
furnishings
of
the
room
were
simple
yet
in
a
way
out
of
the
common
there
were
two
bunks
a
few
rude
but
comfortable
chairs
a
table
two
two
violins
with
their
cases
and
everywhere
books
and
scattered
sheets
of
music
nowhere
was
there
cushion
curtain
or
knickknack
that
told
of
a
woman
taste
or
touch
on
the
other
hand
neither
was
there
anywhere
gun
pelt
or
antlered
head
that
spoke
of
a
man
strength
and
skill
for
decoration
there
were
a
beautiful
copy
of
the
sistine
madonna
several
photographs
signed
with
names
well
known
out
in
the
great
world
beyond
the
mountains
and
a
festoon
of
pine
cones
such
as
a
child
might
gather
and
hang
from
the
little
kitchen
the
sound
of
the
sputtering
suddenly
ceased
and
at
the
door
appeared
a
pair
of
dark
wistful
eyes
daddy
called
the
owner
of
the
eyes
there
was
no
answer
father
are
you
there
called
the
voice
more
insistently
from
one
of
the
bunks
came
a
slight
stir
and
a
murmured
word
at
the
sound
the
boy
at
the
door
leaped
softly
into
the
room
and
hurried
to
the
bunk
in
the
corner
he
was
a
slender
lad
with
short
crisp
curls
at
his
ears
and
the
red
of
perfect
health
in
his
cheeks
his
hands
slim
long
and
with
tapering
fingers
like
a
girl
reached
forward
eagerly
daddy
come
i
done
the
bacon
all
myself
and
the
potatoes
and
the
coffee
too
quick
it
all
getting
cold
slowly
with
the
aid
of
the
boy
firm
hands
the
man
pulled
himself
half
to
a
sitting
posture
his
cheeks
like
the
boy
were
red
but
not
with
health
his
eyes
were
a
little
wild
but
his
voice
was
low
and
very
tender
like
a
caress
david
it
my
little
son
david
of
course
it
david
who
else
should
it
be
laughed
the
boy
come
and
he
tugged
at
the
man
hands
the
man
rose
then
unsteadily
and
by
sheer
will
forced
himself
to
stand
upright
the
wild
look
left
his
eyes
and
the
flush
his
cheeks
his
face
looked
suddenly
old
and
haggard
yet
with
fairly
sure
steps
he
crossed
the
room
and
entered
the
little
kitchen
half
of
the
bacon
was
black
the
other
half
was
transparent
and
like
tough
jelly
the
potatoes
were
soggy
and
had
the
unmistakable
taste
that
comes
from
a
dish
that
has
boiled
dry
the
coffee
was
lukewarm
and
muddy
even
the
milk
was
sour
david
laughed
a
little
ruefully
things
are
so
nice
as
yours
father
he
apologized
i
afraid
i
nothing
but
a
discord
in
that
orchestra
somehow
some
of
the
stove
was
hotter
than
the
rest
and
burnt
up
the
bacon
in
spots
and
all
the
water
got
out
of
the
potatoes
too
though
that
matter
for
i
just
put
more
cold
in
i
forgot
and
left
the
milk
in
the
sun
and
it
tastes
bad
now
but
i
sure
next
time
it
be
better
all
of
it
the
man
smiled
but
he
shook
his
head
sadly
but
there
ought
not
to
be
any
time
david
why
not
what
do
you
mean
are
you
ever
going
to
let
me
try
again
father
there
was
real
distress
in
the
boy
voice
the
man
hesitated
his
lips
parted
with
an
indrawn
breath
as
if
behind
them
lay
a
rush
of
words
but
they
closed
abruptly
the
words
still
unsaid
then
very
lightly
came
these
others
well
son
this
is
a
very
nice
way
to
treat
your
supper
is
it
now
if
you
please
i
take
some
of
that
bacon
i
think
i
feel
my
appetite
coming
back
if
the
truant
appetite
came
back
however
it
could
not
have
stayed
for
the
man
ate
but
little
he
frowned
too
as
he
saw
how
little
the
boy
ate
he
sat
silent
while
his
son
cleared
the
food
and
dishes
away
and
he
was
still
silent
when
with
the
boy
he
passed
out
of
the
house
and
walked
to
the
little
bench
facing
the
west
unless
it
stormed
very
hard
david
never
went
to
bed
without
this
last
look
at
his
silver
lake
as
he
called
the
little
sheet
of
water
far
down
in
the
valley
daddy
it
gold
all
gold
with
the
sun
he
cried
rapturously
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
his
treasure
oh
daddy
it
was
a
cry
of
ecstasy
and
hearing
it
the
man
winced
as
with
sudden
pain
daddy
i
going
to
play
it
i
got
to
play
it
cried
the
boy
bounding
toward
the
cabin
in
a
moment
he
had
returned
violin
at
his
chin
the
man
watched
and
listened
and
as
he
watched
and
listened
his
face
became
a
whereon
pride
and
fear
hope
and
despair
joy
and
sorrow
fought
for
the
mastery
it
was
no
new
thing
for
david
to
play
the
sunset
always
when
he
was
moved
david
turned
to
his
violin
always
in
its
quivering
strings
he
found
the
means
to
say
that
which
his
tongue
could
not
express
across
the
valley
the
grays
and
blues
of
the
mountains
had
become
all
purples
now
above
the
sky
in
one
vast
flame
of
crimson
and
gold
was
a
molten
sea
on
which
floated
below
the
valley
with
its
lake
and
river
picked
out
in
rose
and
gold
against
the
shadowy
greens
of
field
and
forest
seemed
like
some
enchanted
fairyland
of
loveliness
and
all
this
was
in
david
violin
and
all
this
too
was
on
uplifted
rapturous
face
as
the
last
turned
to
gray
and
the
last
strain
quivered
into
silence
the
man
spoke
his
voice
was
almost
harsh
with
david
the
time
has
come
we
have
to
give
it
up
you
and
i
the
boy
turned
wonderingly
his
face
still
softly
luminous
give
what
up
this
all
this
this
why
father
what
do
you
mean
this
is
home
the
man
nodded
wearily
i
know
it
has
been
home
but
david
you
did
think
we
could
always
live
here
like
this
did
you
david
laughed
softly
and
turned
his
eyes
once
more
to
the
distant
why
not
he
asked
dreamily
what
better
place
could
there
be
i
like
it
daddy
the
man
drew
a
troubled
breath
and
stirred
restlessly
the
teasing
pain
in
his
side
was
very
bad
and
no
change
of
position
eased
it
he
was
ill
very
ill
and
he
knew
it
yet
he
also
knew
that
to
david
sickness
pain
and
death
meant
nothing
or
at
most
words
that
had
always
been
lightly
almost
unconsciously
passed
over
for
the
first
time
he
wondered
if
after
all
his
training
some
of
it
had
been
wise
for
six
years
he
had
had
the
boy
under
his
exclusive
care
and
guidance
for
six
years
the
boy
had
eaten
the
food
worn
the
clothing
and
studied
the
books
of
his
father
choosing
for
six
years
that
father
had
thought
planned
breathed
moved
lived
for
his
son
there
had
been
no
others
in
the
little
cabin
there
had
been
only
the
occasional
trips
through
the
woods
to
the
little
town
on
the
for
food
and
clothing
to
break
the
days
of
close
companionship
all
this
the
man
had
planned
carefully
he
had
meant
that
only
the
good
and
beautiful
should
have
place
in
david
youth
it
was
not
that
he
intended
that
evil
unhappiness
and
death
should
lack
definition
only
definiteness
in
the
boy
mind
it
should
be
a
case
where
the
good
and
the
beautiful
should
so
fill
the
thoughts
that
there
would
be
no
room
for
anything
else
this
had
been
his
plan
and
thus
far
he
had
succeeded
succeeded
so
wonderfully
that
he
began
now
in
the
face
of
his
own
illness
and
of
what
he
feared
would
come
of
it
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
that
planning
as
he
looked
at
the
boy
rapt
face
he
remembered
david
surprised
questioning
at
the
first
dead
squirrel
he
had
found
in
the
woods
david
was
six
then
why
daddy
he
asleep
and
he
wo
wake
up
he
had
cried
then
after
a
gentle
touch
and
he
cold
oh
so
cold
the
father
had
hurried
his
son
away
at
the
time
and
had
evaded
his
questions
and
david
had
seemed
content
but
the
next
day
the
boy
had
gone
back
to
the
subject
his
eyes
were
wide
then
and
a
little
frightened
father
what
is
it
to
be
dead
what
do
you
mean
david
the
boy
who
brings
the
milk
he
had
the
squirrel
this
morning
he
said
it
was
not
asleep
it
was
dead
it
means
that
the
squirrel
the
real
squirrel
under
the
fur
has
gone
away
david
where
to
a
far
country
perhaps
will
he
come
back
no
did
he
want
to
go
we
hope
so
but
he
left
his
his
fur
coat
behind
him
did
he
need
that
no
or
he
have
taken
it
with
him
david
had
fallen
silent
at
this
he
had
remained
strangely
silent
indeed
for
some
days
then
out
in
the
woods
with
his
father
one
morning
he
gave
a
joyous
shout
he
was
standing
by
the
brook
and
looking
at
a
little
black
hole
through
which
the
hurrying
water
could
be
plainly
seen
daddy
oh
daddy
i
know
now
how
it
is
about
being
dead
why
david
it
like
the
water
in
the
brook
you
know
that
going
to
a
far
country
and
it
is
coming
back
and
it
leaves
its
little
cold
behind
it
just
as
the
squirrel
did
too
it
does
need
it
it
can
go
without
it
do
you
see
and
it
singing
listen
singing
as
it
goes
it
wants
to
go
yes
david
and
david
father
had
sighed
with
relief
that
his
son
had
found
his
own
explanation
of
the
mystery
and
one
that
satisfied
later
in
his
books
david
found
death
again
it
was
a
man
this
time
the
boy
had
looked
up
with
startled
eyes
do
people
real
people
like
you
and
me
be
dead
father
do
they
go
to
a
far
country
yes
son
in
time
to
a
far
country
ruled
over
by
a
great
and
good
king
they
tell
us
david
father
had
trembled
as
he
said
it
and
had
waited
fearfully
for
the
result
but
david
had
only
smiled
happily
as
he
answered
but
they
go
singing
father
like
the
little
brook
you
know
i
heard
it
and
there
the
matter
had
ended
david
was
ten
now
and
not
yet
for
him
did
death
spell
terror
because
of
this
david
father
was
relieved
and
yet
still
because
of
this
he
was
afraid
david
he
said
gently
listen
to
me
the
boy
turned
with
a
long
sigh
yes
father
we
must
go
away
out
in
the
great
world
there
are
men
and
women
and
children
waiting
for
you
you
a
beautiful
work
to
do
and
one
do
one
work
on
a
why
not
i
like
it
here
and
i
always
been
here
not
always
david
six
years
you
were
four
when
i
brought
you
here
you
do
remember
perhaps
david
shook
his
head
his
eyes
were
again
dreamily
fixed
on
the
sky
i
think
i
like
it
to
go
if
i
could
sail
away
on
that
little
up
there
he
murmured
the
man
sighed
and
shook
his
head
we
ca
go
on
we
must
walk
david
for
a
way
and
we
must
go
soon
soon
he
added
feverishly
i
must
get
you
back
back
among
friends
before
he
rose
unsteadily
and
tried
to
walk
erect
his
limbs
shook
and
the
blood
throbbed
at
his
temples
he
was
appalled
at
his
weakness
with
a
fierceness
born
of
his
terror
he
turned
sharply
to
the
boy
at
his
side
david
we
got
to
go
we
got
to
go
father
yes
yes
come
he
stumbled
blindly
yet
in
some
way
he
reached
the
cabin
door
behind
him
david
still
sat
inert
staring
the
next
minute
the
boy
had
sprung
to
his
feet
and
was
hurrying
after
his
father
chapter
ii
the
trail
a
curious
strength
seemed
to
have
come
to
the
man
with
almost
steady
hands
he
took
down
the
photographs
and
the
sistine
madonna
packing
them
neatly
away
in
a
box
to
be
left
from
beneath
his
bunk
he
dragged
a
large
dusty
and
in
this
he
stowed
a
little
food
a
few
garments
and
a
great
deal
of
the
music
scattered
about
the
room
david
in
the
doorway
stared
in
dazed
wonder
gradually
into
his
eyes
crept
a
look
never
seen
there
before
father
where
are
we
going
he
asked
at
last
in
a
shaking
voice
as
he
came
slowly
into
the
room
back
son
we
going
back
to
the
village
where
we
get
our
eggs
and
bacon
no
no
lad
not
there
the
other
way
we
go
down
into
the
valley
this
time
the
valley
my
valley
with
the
silver
lake
yes
my
son
and
beyond
far
beyond
the
man
spoke
dreamily
he
was
looking
at
a
photograph
in
his
hand
it
had
slipped
in
among
the
loose
sheets
of
music
and
had
not
been
put
away
with
the
others
it
was
the
likeness
of
a
beautiful
woman
for
a
moment
david
eyed
him
uncertainly
then
he
spoke
daddy
who
is
that
who
are
all
these
people
in
the
pictures
never
told
me
about
any
of
them
except
the
little
round
one
that
you
wear
in
your
pocket
who
are
they
instead
of
answering
the
man
turned
faraway
eyes
on
the
boy
and
smiled
wistfully
ah
david
lad
how
they
love
you
how
they
will
love
you
but
you
must
let
them
spoil
you
son
you
must
remember
remember
all
told
you
once
again
david
asked
his
question
but
this
time
the
man
only
turned
back
to
the
photograph
muttering
something
the
boy
could
not
understand
after
that
david
did
not
question
any
more
he
was
too
amazed
too
distressed
he
had
never
before
seen
his
father
like
this
with
nervous
haste
the
man
was
setting
the
little
room
to
rights
crowding
things
into
the
bag
and
packing
other
things
away
in
an
old
trunk
his
cheeks
were
very
red
and
his
eyes
very
bright
he
talked
too
almost
constantly
though
david
could
understand
scarcely
a
word
of
what
was
said
later
the
man
caught
up
his
violin
and
played
and
never
before
had
david
heard
his
father
play
like
that
the
boy
eyes
filled
and
his
heart
ached
with
a
pain
that
choked
and
numbed
though
why
david
could
not
have
told
still
later
the
man
dropped
his
violin
and
sank
exhausted
into
a
chair
and
then
david
worn
and
frightened
with
it
all
crept
to
his
bunk
and
fell
asleep
in
the
gray
dawn
of
the
morning
david
awoke
to
a
different
world
his
father
and
gentle
was
calling
him
to
get
ready
for
breakfast
the
little
room
dismantled
of
its
decorations
was
bare
and
cold
the
bag
closed
and
strapped
rested
on
the
floor
by
the
door
together
with
the
two
violins
in
their
cases
ready
to
carry
we
must
hurry
son
it
a
long
tramp
before
we
take
the
cars
the
cars
the
real
cars
do
we
go
in
those
david
was
fully
awake
now
yes
and
is
that
all
we
to
carry
yes
hurry
son
but
we
come
back
sometime
there
was
no
answer
father
we
coming
back
sometime
david
voice
was
insistent
now
the
man
stooped
and
tightened
a
strap
that
was
already
quite
tight
enough
then
he
laughed
lightly
why
of
course
you
coming
back
sometime
david
only
think
of
all
these
things
we
leaving
when
the
last
dish
was
put
away
the
last
garment
adjusted
and
the
last
look
given
to
the
little
room
the
travelers
picked
up
the
bag
and
the
violins
and
went
out
into
the
sweet
freshness
of
the
morning
as
he
fastened
the
door
the
man
sighed
profoundly
but
david
did
not
notice
this
his
face
was
turned
toward
the
east
always
david
looked
toward
the
sun
daddy
let
not
go
after
all
let
stay
here
he
cried
ardently
drinking
in
the
beauty
of
the
morning
we
must
go
david
come
son
and
the
man
led
the
way
across
the
green
slope
to
the
west
it
was
a
scarcely
perceptible
trail
but
the
man
found
it
and
followed
it
with
evident
confidence
there
was
only
the
pause
now
and
then
to
steady
his
step
or
to
ease
the
burden
of
the
bag
very
soon
the
forest
lay
all
about
them
with
the
birds
singing
over
their
heads
and
with
numberless
tiny
feet
scurrying
through
the
underbrush
on
all
sides
just
out
of
sight
a
brook
babbled
noisily
of
its
delight
in
being
alive
and
away
up
in
the
treetops
the
morning
sun
played
among
the
dancing
leaves
and
david
leaped
and
laughed
and
loved
it
all
nor
was
any
of
it
strange
to
him
the
birds
the
trees
the
sun
the
brook
the
scurrying
little
creatures
of
the
forest
all
were
friends
of
his
but
the
man
the
man
did
not
leap
or
laugh
though
he
too
loved
it
all
the
man
was
afraid
he
knew
now
that
he
had
undertaken
more
than
he
could
carry
out
step
by
step
the
bag
had
grown
heavier
and
hour
by
hour
the
insistent
teasing
pain
in
his
side
had
increased
until
now
it
was
a
torture
he
had
forgotten
that
the
way
to
the
valley
was
so
long
he
had
not
realized
how
nearly
spent
was
his
strength
before
he
even
started
down
the
trail
throbbing
through
his
brain
was
the
question
what
if
after
all
he
could
not
but
even
to
himself
he
would
not
say
the
words
at
noon
they
paused
for
luncheon
and
at
night
they
camped
where
the
chattering
brook
had
stopped
to
rest
in
a
still
black
pool
the
next
morning
the
man
and
the
boy
picked
up
the
trail
again
but
without
the
bag
under
some
leaves
in
a
little
hollow
the
man
had
hidden
the
bag
and
had
then
said
as
if
casually
i
believe
after
all
i
wo
carry
this
along
there
nothing
in
it
that
we
really
need
you
know
now
that
i
taken
out
the
luncheon
box
and
by
night
we
be
down
in
the
valley
of
course
laughed
david
we
do
need
that
and
he
laughed
again
for
pure
joy
little
use
had
david
for
bags
or
baggage
they
were
more
than
halfway
down
the
mountain
now
and
soon
they
reached
a
road
little
traveled
but
yet
a
road
still
later
they
came
to
where
four
ways
crossed
and
two
of
them
bore
the
marks
of
many
wheels
by
sundown
the
little
brook
at
their
side
murmured
softly
of
quiet
fields
and
meadows
and
david
knew
that
the
valley
was
reached
david
was
not
laughing
now
he
was
watching
his
father
with
startled
eyes
david
had
not
known
what
anxiety
was
he
was
finding
out
now
though
he
but
vaguely
realized
that
something
was
not
right
for
some
time
his
father
had
said
but
little
and
that
little
had
been
in
a
voice
that
was
thick
and
he
was
walking
fast
yet
david
noticed
that
every
step
seemed
an
effort
and
that
every
breath
came
in
short
gasps
his
eyes
were
very
bright
and
were
fixedly
bent
on
the
road
ahead
as
if
even
the
haste
he
was
making
was
not
haste
enough
twice
david
spoke
to
him
but
he
did
not
answer
and
the
boy
could
only
trudge
along
on
his
weary
little
feet
and
sigh
for
the
dear
home
on
the
which
they
had
left
behind
them
the
morning
before
they
met
few
fellow
travelers
and
those
they
did
meet
paid
scant
attention
to
the
man
and
the
boy
carrying
the
violins
as
it
chanced
there
was
no
one
in
sight
when
the
man
walking
in
the
grass
at
the
side
of
the
road
stumbled
and
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
david
sprang
quickly
forward
father
what
is
it
what
is
it
there
was
no
answer
daddy
why
do
you
speak
to
me
see
it
david
with
a
painful
effort
the
man
roused
himself
and
sat
up
for
a
moment
he
gazed
dully
into
the
boy
face
then
a
something
seemed
to
stir
him
into
feverish
action
with
shaking
fingers
he
handed
david
his
watch
and
a
small
ivory
miniature
then
he
searched
his
pockets
until
on
the
ground
before
him
lay
a
shining
pile
of
to
david
there
seemed
to
be
a
hundred
of
them
take
them
hide
them
keep
them
david
until
you
need
them
panted
the
man
then
go
go
on
i
ca
alone
without
you
demurred
the
boy
aghast
why
father
i
could
i
do
know
the
way
besides
i
rather
stay
with
you
he
added
soothingly
as
he
slipped
the
watch
and
the
miniature
into
his
pocket
then
we
can
both
go
and
he
dropped
himself
down
at
his
father
side
the
man
shook
his
head
feebly
and
pointed
again
to
the
take
them
david
hide
them
he
chattered
with
pale
lips
almost
impatiently
the
boy
began
picking
up
the
money
and
tucking
it
into
his
pockets
but
father
i
not
going
without
you
he
declared
stoutly
as
the
last
bit
of
gold
slipped
out
of
sight
and
a
horse
and
wagon
rattled
around
the
turn
of
the
road
above
the
driver
of
the
horse
glanced
disapprovingly
at
the
man
and
the
boy
by
the
roadside
but
he
did
not
stop
after
he
had
passed
the
boy
turned
again
to
his
father
the
man
was
fumbling
once
more
in
his
pockets
this
time
from
his
coat
he
produced
a
pencil
and
a
small
notebook
from
which
he
tore
a
page
and
began
to
write
laboriously
painfully
david
sighed
and
looked
about
him
he
was
tired
and
hungry
and
he
did
not
understand
things
at
all
something
very
wrong
very
terrible
must
be
the
matter
with
his
father
here
it
was
almost
dark
yet
they
had
no
place
to
go
no
supper
to
eat
while
far
far
up
on
the
was
their
own
dear
home
sad
and
lonely
without
them
up
there
too
the
sun
still
shone
doubtless
at
least
there
were
the
and
the
silver
lake
to
look
at
while
down
here
there
was
nothing
nothing
but
gray
shadows
a
long
dreary
road
and
a
straggling
house
or
two
in
sight
from
above
the
valley
might
look
to
be
a
fairyland
of
loveliness
but
in
reality
it
was
nothing
but
a
dismal
waste
of
gloom
decided
david
david
father
had
torn
a
second
page
from
his
book
and
was
beginning
another
note
when
the
boy
suddenly
jumped
to
his
feet
one
of
the
straggling
houses
was
near
the
road
where
they
sat
and
its
presence
had
given
david
an
idea
with
swift
steps
he
hurried
to
the
front
door
and
knocked
upon
it
in
answer
a
tall
unsmiling
woman
appeared
and
said
well
david
removed
his
cap
as
his
father
had
taught
him
to
do
when
one
of
the
mountain
women
spoke
to
him
good
evening
lady
i
david
he
began
frankly
my
father
is
so
tired
he
fell
down
back
there
and
we
should
like
very
much
to
stay
with
you
all
night
if
you
do
mind
the
woman
in
the
doorway
stared
for
a
moment
she
was
dumb
with
amazement
her
eyes
swept
the
plain
rather
rough
garments
of
the
boy
then
sought
the
figure
of
the
man
by
the
roadside
her
chin
came
up
angrily
oh
would
you
indeed
well
upon
my
word
she
scouted
humph
we
do
accommodate
tramps
little
boy
and
she
shut
the
door
hard
it
was
david
turn
to
stare
just
what
a
tramp
might
be
he
did
not
know
but
never
before
had
a
request
of
his
been
so
angrily
refused
he
knew
that
a
fierce
something
rose
within
him
a
fierce
new
something
that
sent
the
swift
red
to
his
neck
and
brow
he
raised
a
determined
hand
to
the
doorknob
he
had
something
to
say
to
that
woman
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
again
from
the
inside
see
here
boy
began
the
woman
looking
out
at
him
a
little
less
unkindly
if
you
hungry
i
give
you
some
milk
and
bread
go
around
to
the
back
porch
and
i
get
it
for
you
and
she
shut
the
door
again
david
hand
dropped
to
his
side
the
red
still
stayed
on
his
face
and
neck
however
and
that
fierce
new
something
within
him
bade
him
refuse
to
take
food
from
this
woman
but
there
was
his
father
his
poor
father
who
was
so
tired
and
there
was
his
own
stomach
clamoring
to
be
fed
no
he
could
not
refuse
and
with
slow
steps
and
hanging
head
david
went
around
the
corner
of
the
house
to
the
rear
as
the
of
bread
and
the
pail
of
milk
were
placed
in
his
hands
david
remembered
suddenly
that
in
the
village
store
on
the
mountain
his
father
paid
money
for
his
food
david
was
glad
now
that
he
had
those
in
his
pocket
for
he
could
pay
money
instantly
his
head
came
up
once
more
erect
with
he
shifted
his
burdens
to
one
hand
and
thrust
the
other
into
his
pocket
a
moment
later
he
presented
on
his
outstretched
palm
a
shining
disk
of
gold
will
you
take
this
to
pay
please
for
the
bread
and
milk
he
asked
proudly
the
woman
began
to
shake
her
head
but
as
her
eyes
fell
on
the
money
she
started
and
bent
closer
to
examine
it
the
next
instant
she
jerked
herself
upright
with
an
angry
exclamation
it
gold
a
so
you
a
thief
too
are
you
as
well
as
a
tramp
humph
well
i
guess
you
do
need
this
then
she
finished
sharply
snatching
the
bread
and
the
pail
of
milk
from
the
boy
hand
the
next
moment
david
stood
alone
on
the
doorstep
with
the
sound
of
a
quickly
thrown
bolt
in
his
ears
a
thief
david
knew
little
of
thieves
but
he
knew
what
they
were
only
a
month
before
a
man
had
tried
to
steal
the
violins
from
the
cabin
and
he
was
a
thief
the
said
david
flushed
now
again
angrily
as
he
faced
the
closed
door
but
he
did
not
tarry
he
turned
and
ran
to
his
father
father
come
away
quick
you
must
come
away
he
choked
so
urgent
was
the
boy
voice
that
almost
unconsciously
the
sick
man
got
to
his
feet
with
shaking
hands
he
thrust
the
notes
he
had
been
writing
into
his
pocket
the
little
book
from
which
he
had
torn
the
leaves
for
this
purpose
had
already
dropped
unheeded
into
the
grass
at
his
feet
yes
son
yes
we
go
muttered
the
man
i
feel
better
now
i
can
walk
and
he
did
walk
though
very
slowly
ten
a
dozen
twenty
steps
from
behind
came
the
sound
of
wheels
that
stopped
close
beside
them
hullo
there
going
to
the
village
called
a
voice
yes
sir
david
answer
was
unhesitating
where
the
village
was
he
did
not
know
he
knew
only
that
it
must
be
somewhere
away
from
the
woman
who
had
called
him
a
thief
and
that
was
all
he
cared
to
know
i
going
there
myself
want
a
lift
asked
the
man
still
kindly
yes
sir
thank
you
cried
the
boy
joyfully
and
together
they
aided
his
father
to
climb
into
the
roomy
there
were
few
words
said
the
man
at
the
reins
drove
rapidly
and
paid
little
attention
to
anything
but
his
horses
the
sick
man
dozed
and
rested
the
boy
sat
and
silent
watching
the
trees
and
houses
flit
by
the
sun
had
long
ago
set
but
it
was
not
dark
for
the
moon
was
round
and
bright
and
the
sky
was
cloudless
where
the
road
forked
sharply
the
man
drew
his
horses
to
a
stop
well
i
sorry
but
i
guess
i
have
to
drop
you
here
friends
i
turn
off
to
the
right
but
ai
more
a
quarter
of
a
mile
for
you
now
he
finished
cheerily
pointing
with
his
whip
to
a
cluster
of
twinkling
lights
thank
you
sir
thank
you
breathed
david
gratefully
steadying
his
father
steps
you
helped
us
lots
thank
you
in
david
heart
was
a
wild
desire
to
lay
at
his
good
man
feet
all
of
his
shining
as
payment
for
this
timely
aid
but
caution
held
him
back
it
seemed
that
only
in
stores
did
money
pay
outside
it
branded
one
as
a
thief
alone
with
his
father
david
faced
once
more
his
problem
where
should
they
go
for
the
night
plainly
his
father
could
not
walk
far
he
had
begun
to
talk
again
too
low
sentences
that
david
could
not
understand
and
that
vaguely
troubled
him
there
was
a
house
near
by
and
several
others
down
the
road
toward
the
village
but
david
had
had
all
the
experience
he
wanted
that
night
with
strange
houses
and
strange
women
there
was
a
barn
a
big
one
which
was
nearest
of
all
and
it
was
toward
this
barn
that
david
finally
turned
his
steps
we
go
there
daddy
if
we
can
get
in
he
proposed
softly
and
we
stay
all
night
and
rest
chapter
iii
the
valley
the
long
twilight
of
the
june
day
had
changed
into
a
night
that
was
scarcely
darker
so
bright
was
the
moonlight
seen
from
the
house
the
barn
and
the
low
buildings
beyond
loomed
shadowy
and
unreal
yet
very
beautiful
on
the
side
porch
of
the
house
sat
simeon
holly
and
his
wife
content
to
rest
mind
and
body
only
because
a
full
day
work
lay
well
done
behind
them
it
was
just
as
simeon
rose
to
his
feet
to
go
indoors
that
a
long
note
from
a
violin
reached
their
ears
simeon
cried
the
woman
what
was
that
the
man
did
not
answer
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
barn
simeon
it
a
fiddle
exclaimed
holly
as
a
second
tone
quivered
on
the
air
and
it
in
our
barn
simeon
jaw
set
with
a
stern
ejaculation
he
crossed
the
porch
and
entered
the
kitchen
in
another
minute
he
had
returned
a
lighted
lantern
in
his
hand
simeon
d
do
go
begged
the
woman
tremulously
you
you
know
what
there
fiddles
are
not
played
without
hands
ellen
retorted
the
man
severely
would
you
have
me
go
to
bed
and
leave
a
ungodly
minstrel
fellow
in
possession
of
our
barn
on
my
way
home
i
passed
a
pretty
pair
of
them
lying
by
the
roadside
a
man
and
a
boy
with
two
violins
they
the
culprits
likely
though
how
they
got
this
far
i
do
see
do
you
think
i
want
to
leave
my
barn
to
tramps
like
them
n
no
i
suppose
not
faltered
the
woman
as
she
rose
tremblingly
to
her
feet
and
followed
her
husband
shadow
across
the
yard
once
inside
the
barn
simeon
holly
and
his
wife
paused
involuntarily
the
music
was
all
about
them
now
filling
the
air
with
runs
and
trills
and
rollicking
bits
of
melody
giving
an
angry
exclamation
the
man
turned
then
to
the
narrow
stairway
and
climbed
to
the
hayloft
above
at
his
heels
came
his
wife
and
so
her
eyes
almost
as
soon
as
his
fell
upon
the
man
lying
back
on
the
hay
with
the
moonlight
full
upon
his
face
instantly
the
music
dropped
to
a
whisper
and
a
low
voice
came
out
of
the
gloom
beyond
the
square
of
moonlight
which
came
from
the
window
in
the
roof
if
you
please
be
as
still
as
you
can
sir
you
see
he
asleep
and
he
so
tired
said
the
voice
for
a
moment
the
man
and
the
woman
on
the
stairway
paused
in
amazement
then
the
man
lifted
his
lantern
and
strode
toward
the
voice
who
are
you
what
are
you
doing
here
he
demanded
sharply
a
boy
face
round
tanned
and
just
now
a
bit
anxious
flashed
out
of
the
dark
oh
please
sir
if
you
would
speak
lower
pleaded
the
boy
he
so
tired
i
david
sir
and
that
father
we
came
in
here
to
rest
and
sleep
simeon
holly
unrelenting
gaze
left
the
boy
face
and
swept
that
of
the
man
lying
back
on
the
hay
the
next
instant
he
lowered
the
lantern
and
leaned
nearer
putting
forth
a
cautious
hand
at
once
he
straightened
himself
muttering
a
brusque
word
under
his
breath
then
he
turned
with
the
angry
question
boy
what
do
you
mean
by
playing
a
jig
on
your
fiddle
at
such
a
time
as
this
why
father
asked
me
to
play
returned
the
boy
cheerily
he
said
he
could
walk
through
green
forests
then
with
the
ripple
of
brooks
in
his
ears
and
that
the
birds
and
the
squirrels
see
here
boy
who
are
you
cut
in
simeon
holly
sternly
where
did
you
come
from
from
home
sir
where
is
that
why
home
sir
where
i
live
in
the
mountains
up
up
up
oh
so
far
up
and
there
such
a
big
big
sky
so
much
nicer
than
down
here
the
boy
voice
quivered
and
almost
broke
and
his
eyes
constantly
sought
the
white
face
on
the
hay
it
was
then
that
simeon
holly
awoke
to
the
sudden
realization
that
it
was
time
for
action
he
turned
to
his
wife
take
the
boy
to
the
house
he
directed
incisively
we
have
to
keep
him
i
suppose
i
go
for
higgins
of
course
the
whole
thing
will
have
to
be
put
in
his
hands
at
once
you
ca
do
anything
here
he
added
as
he
caught
her
questioning
glance
leave
everything
just
as
it
is
the
man
is
dead
dead
it
was
a
sharp
cry
from
the
boy
yet
there
was
more
of
wonder
than
of
terror
in
it
do
you
mean
that
he
has
gone
like
the
water
in
the
brook
to
the
far
country
he
faltered
simeon
holly
stared
then
he
said
more
distinctly
your
father
is
dead
boy
and
he
wo
come
back
any
more
david
voice
broke
now
there
was
no
answer
holly
caught
her
breath
convulsively
and
looked
away
even
simeon
holly
refused
to
meet
the
boy
pleading
eyes
with
a
quick
cry
david
sprang
to
his
father
side
but
he
here
right
here
he
challenged
shrilly
daddy
daddy
speak
to
me
it
david
reaching
out
his
hand
he
gently
touched
his
father
face
he
drew
back
then
at
once
his
eyes
distended
with
terror
he
is
he
is
gone
he
chattered
frenziedly
this
the
that
knows
it
the
other
that
they
leave
he
left
it
behind
him
like
the
squirrel
and
the
water
in
the
brook
suddenly
the
boy
face
changed
it
grew
rapt
and
luminous
as
he
leaped
to
his
feet
crying
joyously
but
he
asked
me
to
play
so
he
went
singing
singing
just
as
he
said
that
they
did
and
i
made
him
walk
through
green
forests
with
the
ripple
of
the
brooks
in
his
ears
listen
like
this
and
once
more
the
boy
raised
the
violin
to
his
chin
and
once
more
the
music
trilled
and
rippled
about
the
shocked
amazed
ears
of
simeon
holly
and
his
wife
for
a
time
neither
the
man
nor
the
woman
could
speak
there
was
nothing
in
their
humdrum
tilling
of
the
soil
and
washing
of
pots
and
pans
to
prepare
them
for
a
scene
like
this
a
moonlit
barn
a
strange
dead
man
and
that
dead
man
son
babbling
of
brooks
and
squirrels
and
playing
jigs
on
a
fiddle
for
a
dirge
at
last
however
simeon
found
his
voice
boy
boy
stop
that
he
thundered
are
you
mad
clean
mad
go
into
the
house
i
say
and
the
boy
dazed
but
obedient
put
up
his
violin
and
followed
the
woman
who
with
eyes
was
leading
the
way
down
the
stairs
holly
was
frightened
but
she
was
also
strangely
moved
from
the
long
ago
the
sound
of
another
violin
had
come
to
her
a
violin
too
played
by
a
boy
hands
but
of
this
all
this
holly
did
not
like
to
think
in
the
kitchen
now
she
turned
and
faced
her
young
guest
are
you
hungry
little
boy
david
hesitated
he
had
not
forgotten
the
woman
the
milk
and
the
are
you
hungry
dear
stammered
holly
again
and
this
time
david
clamorous
stomach
forced
a
yes
from
his
unwilling
lips
which
sent
holly
at
once
into
the
pantry
for
bread
and
milk
and
a
plate
of
doughnuts
such
as
david
had
never
seen
before
like
any
hungry
boy
david
ate
his
supper
and
holly
in
the
face
of
this
very
ordinary
sight
of
hunger
being
appeased
at
her
table
breathed
more
freely
and
ventured
to
think
that
perhaps
this
strange
little
boy
was
not
so
very
strange
after
all
what
is
your
name
she
found
courage
to
ask
then
david
david
what
just
david
but
your
father
name
holly
had
almost
asked
but
stopped
in
time
she
did
not
want
to
speak
of
him
where
do
you
live
she
asked
instead
on
the
mountain
up
up
on
the
mountain
where
i
can
see
my
silver
lake
every
day
you
know
but
you
did
live
there
alone
oh
no
with
father
before
he
went
away
faltered
the
boy
the
woman
flushed
red
and
bit
her
lip
no
no
i
mean
were
there
no
other
houses
but
yours
she
stammered
no
but
was
your
mother
anywhere
oh
yes
in
father
pocket
your
mother
in
your
father
pocket
so
plainly
aghast
was
the
questioner
that
david
looked
not
a
little
surprised
as
he
explained
you
do
understand
she
is
an
and
have
anything
only
their
pictures
down
here
with
us
and
that
what
we
have
and
father
always
carried
it
in
his
pocket
oh
h
murmured
holly
a
quick
mist
in
her
eyes
then
gently
and
did
you
always
live
there
on
the
mountain
six
years
father
said
but
what
did
you
do
all
day
were
you
ever
lonesome
lonesome
the
boy
eyes
were
puzzled
yes
did
you
miss
things
people
other
houses
boys
of
your
own
age
and
and
such
things
david
eyes
widened
why
how
could
i
he
cried
when
i
had
daddy
and
my
violin
and
my
silver
lake
and
the
whole
of
the
great
big
woods
with
everything
in
them
to
talk
to
and
to
talk
to
me
woods
and
things
in
them
to
to
talk
to
you
why
yes
it
was
the
little
brook
you
know
after
the
squirrel
that
told
me
about
being
dead
and
yes
yes
but
never
mind
dear
now
stammered
the
woman
rising
hurriedly
to
her
feet
the
boy
was
a
little
wild
after
all
she
thought
you
you
should
go
to
bed
have
you
a
a
bag
or
or
anything
no
we
left
it
smiled
david
apologetically
you
see
we
had
so
much
in
it
that
it
got
too
heavy
to
carry
so
we
did
bring
it
so
much
in
it
you
did
bring
it
indeed
repeated
holly
under
her
breath
throwing
up
her
hands
with
a
gesture
of
despair
boy
what
are
you
anyway
it
was
not
meant
for
a
question
but
to
the
woman
surprise
the
boy
answered
frankly
simply
father
says
that
i
one
little
instrument
in
the
great
orchestra
of
life
and
that
i
must
see
to
it
that
i
always
in
tune
and
do
drag
or
hit
false
notes
my
land
breathed
the
woman
dropping
back
in
her
chair
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
boy
then
with
an
effort
she
got
to
her
feet
come
you
must
go
to
bed
she
stammered
i
sure
bed
is
is
the
best
place
you
i
think
i
can
find
what
what
you
need
she
finished
feebly
in
a
snug
little
room
over
the
kitchen
some
minutes
later
david
found
himself
at
last
alone
the
room
though
it
had
once
belonged
to
a
boy
of
his
own
age
looked
very
strange
to
david
on
the
floor
was
a
rug
the
first
he
had
ever
seen
on
the
walls
were
a
a
toy
shotgun
and
a
case
full
of
bugs
and
moths
each
little
body
impaled
on
a
pin
to
david
shuddering
horror
the
bed
had
four
tall
posts
at
the
corners
and
a
very
puffy
top
that
filled
david
with
wonder
as
to
how
he
was
to
reach
it
or
stay
there
if
he
did
gain
it
across
a
chair
lay
a
boy
long
nightshirt
that
the
kind
lady
had
left
after
hurriedly
wiping
her
eyes
with
the
edge
of
its
hem
in
all
the
circle
of
the
candlelight
there
was
just
one
familiar
object
to
david
homesick
eyes
the
long
black
violin
case
which
he
had
brought
in
himself
and
which
held
his
beloved
violin
with
his
back
carefully
turned
toward
the
impaled
bugs
and
moths
on
the
wall
david
undressed
himself
and
slipped
into
the
nightshirt
which
he
sniffed
at
gratefully
so
like
pine
woods
was
the
perfume
that
hung
about
its
folds
then
he
blew
out
the
candle
and
groped
his
way
to
the
one
window
the
little
room
contained
the
moon
still
shone
but
little
could
be
seen
through
the
thick
green
branches
of
the
tree
outside
from
the
yard
below
came
the
sound
of
wheels
and
of
men
excited
voices
there
came
also
the
twinkle
of
lanterns
borne
by
hurrying
hands
and
the
tramp
of
shuffling
feet
in
the
window
david
shivered
there
were
no
wide
sweep
of
mountain
hill
and
valley
no
silver
lake
no
restful
hush
no
daddy
no
beautiful
things
that
were
there
was
only
the
dreary
hollow
mockery
of
the
things
they
had
become
long
minutes
later
david
with
the
violin
in
his
arms
lay
down
upon
the
rug
and
for
the
first
time
since
babyhood
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
but
it
was
a
sleep
that
brought
no
rest
for
in
it
he
dreamed
that
he
was
a
big
moth
pinned
with
a
star
to
an
sky
chapter
iv
two
letters
in
the
early
gray
dawn
david
awoke
his
first
sensation
was
the
physical
numbness
and
stiffness
that
came
from
his
hard
bed
on
the
floor
why
daddy
he
began
pulling
himself
i
slept
all
night
on
he
stopped
suddenly
brushing
his
eyes
with
the
backs
of
his
hands
why
daddy
where
then
full
consciousness
came
to
him
with
a
low
cry
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
ran
to
the
window
through
the
trees
he
could
see
the
sunrise
glow
of
the
eastern
sky
down
in
the
yard
no
one
was
in
sight
but
the
barn
door
was
open
and
with
a
quick
indrawing
of
his
breath
david
turned
back
into
the
room
and
began
to
thrust
himself
into
his
clothing
the
gold
in
his
sagging
pockets
clinked
and
jingled
musically
and
once
half
a
dozen
pieces
rolled
out
upon
the
floor
for
a
moment
the
boy
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
let
them
remain
where
they
were
but
the
next
minute
with
an
impatient
gesture
he
had
picked
them
up
and
thrust
them
deep
into
one
of
his
pockets
silencing
their
jingling
with
his
handkerchief
once
dressed
david
picked
up
his
violin
and
stepped
softly
into
the
hall
at
first
no
sound
reached
his
ears
then
from
the
kitchen
below
came
the
clatter
of
brisk
feet
and
the
rattle
of
tins
and
crockery
tightening
his
clasp
on
the
violin
david
slipped
quietly
down
the
back
stairs
and
out
to
the
yard
it
was
only
a
few
seconds
then
before
he
was
hurrying
through
the
open
doorway
of
the
barn
and
up
the
narrow
stairway
to
the
loft
above
at
the
top
however
he
came
to
a
sharp
pause
with
a
low
cry
the
next
moment
he
turned
to
see
a
man
looking
up
at
him
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
oh
sir
please
please
where
is
he
what
have
you
done
with
him
appealed
the
boy
almost
plunging
headlong
down
the
stairs
in
his
haste
to
reach
the
bottom
into
the
man
face
came
a
look
of
sincere
but
awkward
sympathy
oh
hullo
sonny
so
you
the
boy
are
ye
he
began
diffidently
yes
yes
i
david
but
where
is
he
my
father
you
know
i
mean
the
the
part
he
he
left
behind
him
choked
the
boy
the
part
like
the
the
man
stared
then
involuntarily
he
began
to
back
away
well
ye
see
i
i
but
maybe
you
do
know
interrupted
david
feverishly
you
the
man
i
saw
last
night
who
are
you
where
is
he
the
other
one
please
no
i
i
here
that
is
not
at
the
first
spoke
up
the
man
quickly
still
unconsciously
backing
away
me
i
only
larson
perry
larson
ye
know
was
holly
you
see
last
night
him
that
i
works
for
then
where
is
holly
please
faltered
the
boy
hurrying
toward
the
barn
door
maybe
he
would
know
about
father
oh
there
he
is
and
david
ran
out
of
the
barn
and
across
the
yard
to
the
kitchen
porch
it
was
an
unhappy
ten
minutes
that
david
spent
then
besides
holly
there
were
holly
and
the
man
perry
larson
and
they
all
talked
but
little
of
what
they
said
could
david
understand
to
none
of
his
questions
could
he
obtain
an
answer
that
satisfied
neither
on
his
part
could
he
seem
to
reply
to
their
questions
in
a
way
that
pleased
them
they
went
in
to
breakfast
then
and
holly
and
the
man
perry
larson
they
asked
david
to
go
at
least
holly
asked
him
but
david
shook
his
head
and
said
no
no
thank
you
very
much
i
rather
not
if
you
please
not
now
then
he
dropped
himself
down
on
the
steps
to
think
as
if
he
could
eat
with
that
great
choking
lump
in
his
throat
that
refused
to
be
swallowed
david
was
thoroughly
dazed
frightened
and
dismayed
he
knew
now
that
never
again
in
this
world
would
he
see
his
dear
father
or
hear
him
speak
this
much
had
been
made
very
clear
to
him
during
the
last
ten
minutes
why
this
should
be
so
or
what
his
father
would
want
him
to
do
he
could
not
seem
to
find
out
not
until
now
had
he
realized
at
all
what
this
going
away
of
his
father
was
to
mean
to
him
and
he
told
himself
frantically
that
he
could
not
have
it
so
he
could
not
have
it
so
but
even
as
he
said
the
words
he
knew
that
it
was
so
irrevocably
so
david
began
then
to
long
for
his
mountain
home
there
at
least
he
would
have
his
dear
forest
all
about
him
with
the
birds
and
the
squirrels
and
the
friendly
little
brooks
there
he
would
have
his
silver
lake
to
look
at
too
and
all
of
them
would
speak
to
him
of
his
father
he
believed
indeed
that
up
there
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
his
father
were
really
with
him
and
anyway
if
his
father
ever
should
come
back
it
would
be
there
that
he
would
be
sure
to
seek
him
up
there
in
the
little
mountain
home
so
dear
to
them
both
back
to
the
cabin
he
would
go
now
then
yes
indeed
he
would
with
a
low
word
and
a
passionately
intent
expression
david
got
to
his
feet
picked
up
his
violin
and
hurried
down
the
driveway
and
out
upon
the
main
highway
turning
in
the
direction
from
whence
he
had
come
with
his
father
the
night
before
the
hollys
had
just
finished
breakfast
when
higgins
the
coroner
drove
into
the
yard
accompanied
by
william
streeter
the
town
most
prominent
farmer
and
the
most
miserly
one
if
report
was
to
be
credited
well
could
you
get
anything
out
of
the
boy
demanded
higgins
without
ceremony
as
simeon
holly
and
larson
appeared
on
the
kitchen
porch
very
little
really
nothing
of
importance
answered
simeon
holly
where
is
he
now
why
he
was
here
on
the
steps
a
few
minutes
ago
simeon
holly
looked
about
him
a
bit
impatiently
well
i
want
to
see
him
i
got
a
letter
for
him
a
letter
exclaimed
simeon
holly
and
larson
in
amazed
unison
yes
found
it
in
his
father
pocket
nodded
the
coroner
with
all
the
tantalizing
brevity
of
a
man
who
knows
he
has
a
choice
morsel
of
information
that
is
eagerly
awaited
it
addressed
to
boy
david
so
i
calculated
we
better
give
it
to
him
first
without
reading
it
seeing
it
his
after
he
reads
it
though
i
want
to
see
it
i
want
to
see
if
what
it
says
is
any
nearer
being
than
the
other
one
is
the
other
one
exclaimed
the
amazed
chorus
again
oh
yes
there
another
one
spoke
up
william
streeter
tersely
and
i
read
it
all
but
the
scrawl
at
the
end
there
could
anybody
read
that
higgins
laughed
well
i
free
to
confess
is
a
sticker
that
name
he
admitted
and
it
the
name
we
want
of
course
to
tell
us
who
they
are
since
it
seems
the
boy
do
know
from
what
you
said
last
night
i
was
in
hopes
by
this
morning
you
have
found
out
more
from
him
simeon
holly
shook
his
head
was
impossible
gosh
i
should
say
was
cut
in
perry
larson
with
emphasis
queer
ai
no
name
for
it
one
minute
he
be
talkin
good
common
sense
like
anybody
an
the
next
he
be
chatterin
of
coats
made
ice
an
birds
an
squirrels
an
babbling
brooks
he
sure
is
dippy
listen
he
actually
do
seem
ter
know
the
between
himself
an
his
fiddle
we
was
tryin
ter
find
out
this
mornin
what
he
could
do
an
what
he
wanted
ter
do
when
if
he
did
up
an
say
that
his
father
told
him
it
did
make
so
much
what
he
did
so
long
as
he
kept
hisself
in
tune
an
did
strike
false
notes
now
what
do
yer
think
o
that
yes
i
know
nodded
higgins
musingly
there
was
something
queer
about
them
and
they
were
just
ordinary
tramps
did
i
tell
you
i
overtook
them
last
night
away
up
on
the
fairbanks
road
by
the
taylor
place
and
i
gave
a
lift
i
particularly
noticed
what
a
decent
sort
they
were
they
were
clean
and
and
their
clothes
were
good
even
if
they
were
rough
yet
they
did
have
any
baggage
but
them
fiddles
but
what
was
that
second
letter
you
mentioned
asked
simeon
holly
higgins
smiled
oddly
and
reached
into
his
pocket
the
letter
oh
you
welcome
to
read
the
letter
he
said
as
he
handed
over
a
bit
of
folded
paper
simeon
took
it
gingerly
and
examined
it
it
was
a
leaf
torn
apparently
from
a
note
book
it
was
folded
three
times
and
bore
on
the
outside
the
superscription
to
whom
it
may
concern
the
handwriting
was
peculiar
irregular
and
not
very
legible
but
as
near
as
it
could
be
deciphered
the
note
ran
thus
now
that
the
time
has
come
when
i
must
give
david
back
to
the
world
i
have
set
out
for
that
purpose
but
i
am
ill
very
ill
and
should
death
have
swifter
feet
than
i
i
must
leave
my
task
for
others
to
complete
deal
gently
with
him
he
knows
only
that
which
is
good
and
beautiful
he
knows
nothing
of
sin
nor
evil
then
followed
the
signature
a
thing
of
scrawls
and
flourishes
that
conveyed
no
sort
of
meaning
to
simeon
holly
puzzled
eyes
well
prompted
higgins
expectantly
simeon
holly
shook
his
head
i
can
make
little
of
it
it
certainly
is
a
most
remarkable
note
could
you
read
the
name
no
well
i
could
neither
could
half
a
dozen
others
that
seen
it
but
where
the
boy
mebbe
his
note
talk
sense
i
go
find
him
volunteered
larson
he
must
be
somewheres
but
david
was
very
evidently
not
somewheres
at
least
he
was
not
in
the
barn
the
shed
the
kitchen
bedroom
nor
anywhere
else
that
larson
looked
and
the
man
was
just
coming
back
with
a
crestfallen
perplexed
frown
when
holly
hurried
out
on
to
the
porch
higgins
she
cried
in
obvious
excitement
your
wife
has
just
telephoned
that
her
sister
mollie
has
just
telephoned
her
that
that
little
tramp
boy
with
the
violin
is
at
her
house
at
mollie
exclaimed
higgins
why
that
a
mile
or
more
from
here
so
that
where
he
is
interposed
larson
hurrying
forward
doggone
the
little
rascal
he
must
slipped
away
while
we
was
breakfast
yes
but
simeon
higgins
we
had
ought
to
let
him
go
like
that
appealed
holly
tremulously
your
wife
said
mollie
said
she
found
him
crying
at
the
crossroads
because
he
did
know
which
way
to
take
he
said
he
was
going
back
home
he
means
to
that
wretched
cabin
on
the
mountain
you
know
and
we
ca
let
him
do
that
alone
a
child
like
that
where
is
he
now
demanded
higgins
in
mollie
kitchen
eating
bread
and
milk
but
she
said
she
had
an
awful
time
getting
him
to
eat
and
she
wants
to
know
what
to
do
with
him
that
why
she
telephoned
your
wife
she
thought
you
ought
to
know
he
was
there
yes
of
course
well
tell
her
to
tell
him
to
come
back
mollie
said
she
tried
to
have
him
come
back
but
that
he
said
no
thank
you
he
rather
not
he
was
going
home
where
his
father
could
find
him
if
he
should
ever
want
him
higgins
we
we
ca
let
him
go
off
like
that
why
the
child
would
die
up
there
alone
in
those
dreadful
woods
even
if
he
could
get
there
in
the
first
place
which
i
very
much
doubt
yes
of
course
of
course
muttered
higgins
with
a
thoughtful
frown
there
his
letter
too
say
he
added
brightening
what
you
bet
that
letter
wo
fetch
him
he
seems
to
think
the
world
and
all
of
his
daddy
here
he
directed
turning
to
holly
you
tell
my
wife
to
tell
better
yet
you
telephone
mollie
yourself
please
and
tell
her
to
tell
the
boy
we
got
a
letter
here
for
him
from
his
father
and
he
can
have
it
if
he
come
i
will
i
will
called
holly
over
her
shoulder
as
she
hurried
into
the
house
in
an
unbelievably
short
time
she
was
back
her
face
beaming
he
started
so
soon
she
nodded
he
crazy
with
joy
mollie
said
he
even
left
part
of
his
breakfast
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
so
i
guess
we
see
him
all
right
oh
yes
we
see
him
all
right
echoed
simeon
holly
grimly
but
that
is
telling
what
we
do
with
him
when
we
do
see
him
oh
well
maybe
this
letter
of
his
will
help
us
out
on
that
suggested
higgins
soothingly
anyhow
even
if
it
does
i
not
worrying
any
i
guess
some
one
will
want
him
a
good
healthy
boy
like
that
did
you
find
any
money
on
the
body
asked
streeter
a
little
change
a
few
cents
nothing
to
count
if
the
boy
letter
does
tell
us
where
any
of
their
folks
are
it
be
up
to
the
town
to
bury
him
all
right
he
had
a
fiddle
did
he
and
the
boy
had
one
too
would
they
bring
anything
streeter
round
blue
eyes
gleamed
shrewdly
higgins
gave
a
slow
shake
of
his
head
maybe
if
there
was
a
market
for
but
who
buy
there
ai
a
soul
in
town
plays
but
jack
gurnsey
and
he
got
one
besides
sick
and
got
all
he
can
do
to
buy
bread
and
butter
for
him
and
his
sister
without
taking
in
more
fiddles
i
guess
he
would
buy
hm
m
maybe
not
maybe
not
grunted
streeter
an
as
you
say
the
only
one
that
got
any
use
for
here
an
like
enough
they
ai
worth
much
anyway
so
i
guess
is
up
to
the
town
all
right
yes
but
if
yer
take
it
from
me
interrupted
larson
you
be
wise
if
ye
keep
still
before
the
boy
it
no
use
askin
him
anythin
we
proved
that
fast
enough
an
if
he
once
turns
an
begins
ter
ask
you
questions
yer
done
for
i
guess
you
right
nodded
higgins
with
a
quizzical
smile
and
as
long
as
questioning
ca
do
any
good
why
we
just
keep
whist
before
the
boy
meanwhile
i
wish
the
little
rascal
would
hurry
up
and
get
here
i
want
to
see
the
inside
of
that
letter
to
him
i
relying
on
that
being
some
help
to
unsnarl
this
tangle
of
telling
who
they
are
well
he
started
reiterated
holly
as
she
turned
back
into
the
house
so
i
guess
he
get
here
if
you
wait
long
enough
oh
yes
he
get
here
if
we
wait
long
enough
echoed
simeon
holly
again
crustily
the
two
men
in
the
wagon
settled
themselves
more
comfortably
in
their
seats
and
perry
larson
after
a
glance
at
his
employer
dropped
himself
onto
the
bottom
step
simeon
holly
had
already
sat
down
stiffly
in
one
of
the
porch
chairs
simeon
holly
never
dropped
himself
anywhere
indeed
according
to
perry
larson
if
there
were
a
hard
way
to
do
a
thing
simeon
holly
found
it
and
did
it
the
fact
that
this
morning
he
had
allowed
and
was
still
allowing
the
sacred
routine
of
the
day
work
to
be
thus
interrupted
for
nothing
more
important
than
the
expected
arrival
of
a
strolling
urchin
was
something
larson
would
not
have
believed
had
he
not
seen
it
even
now
he
was
conscious
once
or
twice
of
an
involuntary
desire
to
rub
his
eyes
to
make
sure
they
were
not
deceiving
him
impatient
as
the
waiting
men
were
for
the
arrival
of
david
they
were
yet
almost
surprised
so
soon
did
he
appear
running
up
the
driveway
oh
where
is
it
please
he
panted
they
said
you
had
a
letter
for
me
from
daddy
you
right
sonny
we
have
and
here
it
is
answered
higgins
promptly
holding
out
the
folded
paper
plainly
eager
as
he
was
david
did
not
open
the
note
till
he
had
first
carefully
set
down
the
case
holding
his
violin
then
he
devoured
it
with
eager
eyes
as
he
read
the
four
men
watched
his
face
they
saw
first
the
quick
tears
that
had
to
be
blinked
away
then
they
saw
the
radiant
glow
that
grew
and
deepened
until
the
whole
boyish
face
was
aflame
with
the
splendor
of
it
they
saw
the
shining
wonder
of
his
eyes
too
as
he
looked
up
from
the
letter
and
daddy
wrote
this
to
me
from
the
far
country
he
breathed
simeon
holly
scowled
larson
choked
over
a
stifled
chuckle
william
streeter
stared
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
higgins
flushed
a
dull
red
no
sonny
he
stammered
we
found
it
on
the
er
i
mean
it
er
your
father
left
it
in
his
pocket
for
you
finished
the
man
a
little
explosively
a
swift
shadow
crossed
the
boy
face
oh
i
hoped
i
heard
he
began
then
suddenly
he
stopped
his
face
once
more
alight
but
it
the
same
as
if
he
wrote
it
from
there
is
it
he
left
it
for
me
and
he
told
me
what
to
do
what
that
what
that
cried
higgins
instantly
alert
did
he
tell
you
what
to
do
then
let
have
it
so
we
know
you
will
let
us
read
it
wo
you
boy
why
y
yes
stammered
david
holding
it
out
politely
but
with
evident
reluctance
thank
you
nodded
higgins
as
he
reached
for
the
note
david
letter
was
very
different
from
the
other
one
it
was
longer
but
it
did
not
help
much
though
it
was
easily
read
in
his
letter
in
spite
of
the
wavering
lines
each
word
was
formed
with
a
care
that
told
of
a
father
thought
for
the
young
eyes
that
would
read
it
it
was
written
on
two
of
the
notebook
leaves
and
at
the
end
came
the
single
word
daddy
david
my
boy
read
higgins
aloud
in
the
far
country
i
am
waiting
for
you
do
not
grieve
for
that
will
grieve
me
i
shall
not
return
but
some
day
you
will
come
to
me
your
violin
at
your
chin
and
the
bow
drawn
across
the
strings
to
greet
me
see
that
it
tells
me
of
the
beautiful
world
you
have
left
for
it
is
a
beautiful
world
david
never
forget
that
and
if
sometime
you
are
tempted
to
think
it
is
not
a
beautiful
world
just
remember
that
you
yourself
can
make
it
beautiful
if
you
will
you
are
among
new
faces
surrounded
by
things
and
people
that
are
strange
to
you
some
of
them
you
will
not
understand
some
of
them
you
may
not
like
but
do
not
fear
david
and
do
not
plead
to
go
back
to
the
hills
remember
this
my
boy
in
your
violin
lie
all
the
things
you
long
for
you
have
only
to
play
and
the
broad
skies
of
your
mountain
home
will
be
over
you
and
the
dear
friends
and
comrades
of
your
mountain
forests
will
be
about
you
daddy
gorry
that
worse
than
the
other
groaned
higgins
when
he
had
finished
the
note
there
actually
nothing
in
it
would
you
think
if
a
man
wrote
anything
at
such
a
time
that
he
wrote
something
that
had
some
sense
to
it
something
that
one
could
get
hold
of
and
find
out
who
the
boy
is
there
was
no
answering
this
the
assembled
men
could
only
grunt
and
nod
in
agreement
which
after
all
was
no
real
help
chapter
v
discords
the
dead
man
found
in
farmer
holly
barn
created
a
decided
stir
in
the
village
of
hinsdale
the
case
was
a
peculiar
one
for
many
reasons
first
because
of
the
boy
hinsdale
supposed
it
knew
boys
but
it
felt
inclined
to
change
its
mind
after
seeing
this
one
second
because
of
the
circumstances
the
boy
and
his
father
had
entered
the
town
like
tramps
yet
higgins
who
talked
freely
of
his
having
given
the
pair
a
lift
on
that
very
evening
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
that
he
did
not
believe
them
to
be
ordinary
tramps
at
all
as
there
had
been
little
found
in
the
dead
man
pockets
save
the
two
notes
and
as
nobody
could
be
found
who
wanted
the
violins
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
do
but
to
turn
the
body
over
to
the
town
for
burial
nothing
was
said
of
this
to
david
indeed
as
little
as
possible
was
said
to
david
about
anything
after
that
morning
when
higgins
had
given
him
his
father
letter
at
that
time
the
men
had
made
one
more
effort
to
get
track
of
something
as
higgins
had
despairingly
put
it
but
the
boy
answers
to
their
questions
were
anything
but
satisfying
anything
but
helpful
and
were
often
most
disconcerting
the
boy
was
in
fact
regarded
by
most
of
the
men
after
that
morning
as
being
a
little
off
and
was
hence
let
severely
alone
who
the
man
was
the
town
authorities
certainly
did
not
know
neither
could
they
apparently
find
out
his
name
as
written
by
himself
was
unreadable
his
notes
told
nothing
his
son
could
tell
little
more
of
consequence
a
report
to
be
sure
did
come
from
the
village
far
up
the
mountain
that
such
a
man
and
boy
had
lived
in
a
hut
that
was
almost
inaccessible
but
even
this
did
not
help
solve
the
mystery
david
was
left
at
the
holly
farmhouse
though
simeon
holly
mentally
declared
that
he
should
lose
no
time
in
looking
about
for
some
one
to
take
the
boy
away
on
that
first
day
higgins
picking
up
the
reins
preparatory
to
driving
from
the
yard
had
said
with
a
nod
of
his
head
toward
david
well
how
about
it
holly
shall
we
leave
him
here
till
we
find
somebody
that
wants
him
why
y
yes
i
suppose
so
hesitated
simeon
holly
with
uncordial
accent
but
his
wife
hovering
in
the
background
hastened
forward
at
once
oh
yes
yes
indeed
she
urged
i
sure
he
he
wo
be
a
mite
of
trouble
simeon
perhaps
not
conceded
simeon
holly
darkly
neither
it
is
safe
to
say
will
he
be
anything
else
worth
anything
that
it
exactly
spoke
up
streeter
from
his
seat
in
the
wagon
if
i
thought
he
be
worth
his
salt
now
i
take
him
myself
but
well
look
at
him
this
minute
he
finished
with
a
disdainful
shrug
david
on
the
lowest
step
was
very
evidently
not
hearing
a
word
of
what
was
being
said
with
his
sensitive
face
illumined
he
was
again
poring
over
his
father
letter
something
in
the
sudden
quiet
cut
through
his
absorption
as
the
noisy
hum
of
voices
had
not
been
able
to
do
and
he
raised
his
head
his
eyes
were
starlike
i
so
glad
father
told
me
what
to
do
he
breathed
it
be
easier
now
receiving
no
answer
from
the
somewhat
awkwardly
silent
men
he
went
on
as
if
in
explanation
you
know
he
waiting
for
me
in
the
far
country
i
mean
he
said
he
was
and
when
you
got
somebody
waiting
you
do
mind
staying
behind
yourself
for
a
little
while
besides
i
got
to
stay
to
find
out
about
the
beautiful
world
you
know
so
i
can
tell
him
when
go
that
the
way
i
used
to
do
back
home
on
the
mountain
you
see
tell
him
about
things
lots
of
days
we
go
to
walk
then
when
we
got
home
he
have
me
tell
him
with
my
violin
what
i
seen
and
now
he
says
i
to
stay
here
here
it
was
the
quick
stern
voice
of
simeon
holly
yes
nodded
david
earnestly
to
learn
about
the
beautiful
world
do
you
remember
and
he
said
i
was
not
to
want
to
go
back
to
my
mountains
that
i
would
not
need
to
anyway
because
the
mountains
and
the
sky
and
the
birds
and
squirrels
and
brooks
are
really
in
my
violin
you
know
and
but
with
an
angry
frown
simeon
holly
stalked
away
motioning
larson
to
follow
him
and
with
a
merry
glance
and
a
low
chuckle
higgins
turned
his
horse
about
and
drove
from
the
yard
a
moment
later
david
found
himself
alone
with
holly
who
was
looking
at
him
with
wistful
though
slightly
fearful
eyes
did
you
have
all
the
breakfast
you
wanted
she
asked
timidly
resorting
as
she
had
resorted
the
night
before
to
the
everyday
things
of
her
world
in
the
hope
that
they
might
make
this
strange
little
boy
seem
less
wild
and
more
nearly
human
oh
yes
thank
you
david
eyes
had
strayed
back
to
the
note
in
his
hand
suddenly
he
looked
up
a
new
something
in
his
eyes
what
is
it
to
be
a
a
tramp
he
asked
those
men
said
daddy
and
i
were
tramps
a
tramp
oh
er
why
just
a
a
tramp
stammered
holly
but
never
mind
that
david
i
i
would
think
any
more
about
it
but
what
is
a
tramp
persisted
david
a
smouldering
fire
beginning
to
show
in
his
eyes
because
if
they
meant
thieves
no
no
david
interrupted
holly
soothingly
they
never
meant
thieves
at
all
then
what
is
it
to
be
a
tramp
why
it
just
to
to
tramp
explained
holly
desperately
walk
along
the
road
from
one
town
to
another
and
and
not
live
in
a
house
at
all
oh
david
face
cleared
that
all
right
then
i
love
to
be
a
tramp
and
so
father
and
we
were
tramps
sometimes
too
lots
of
times
in
the
summer
we
did
stay
in
the
cabin
hardly
any
just
lived
out
of
doors
all
day
and
all
night
why
i
never
knew
really
what
the
pine
trees
were
saying
till
i
heard
them
at
night
lying
under
them
you
know
what
i
mean
you
heard
them
have
you
at
night
pine
trees
stammered
holly
helplessly
yes
oh
have
you
ever
heard
them
at
night
cried
the
boy
in
his
voice
a
very
genuine
sympathy
as
for
a
grievous
loss
why
then
if
you
only
heard
them
daytimes
you
do
know
a
bit
what
pine
trees
really
are
but
i
can
tell
you
listen
this
is
what
they
say
finished
the
boy
whipping
his
violin
from
its
case
and
after
a
swift
testing
of
the
strings
plunging
into
a
weird
haunting
little
melody
in
the
doorway
holly
bewildered
yet
bewitched
stood
motionless
her
eyes
fixed
on
glorified
face
she
was
still
in
the
same
position
when
simeon
holly
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
well
ellen
he
began
with
quiet
scorn
after
a
moment
stern
watching
of
the
scene
before
him
have
you
nothing
better
to
do
this
morning
than
to
listen
to
this
minstrel
fellow
oh
simeon
why
yes
of
course
i
i
forgot
what
i
was
doing
faltered
holly
flushing
guiltily
from
neck
to
brow
as
she
turned
and
hurried
into
the
house
david
on
the
porch
steps
seemed
to
have
heard
nothing
he
was
still
playing
his
rapt
gaze
on
the
distant
when
simeon
holly
turned
upon
him
with
disapproving
eyes
see
here
boy
ca
you
do
anything
but
fiddle
he
demanded
then
as
david
still
continued
to
play
he
added
sharply
did
you
hear
me
boy
the
music
stopped
abruptly
david
looked
up
with
the
slightly
dazed
air
of
one
who
has
been
summoned
as
from
another
world
did
you
speak
to
me
sir
he
asked
i
did
twice
i
asked
if
you
never
did
anything
but
play
that
fiddle
you
mean
at
home
david
face
expressed
mild
wonder
without
a
trace
of
anger
or
resentment
why
yes
of
course
i
could
play
all
the
time
you
know
i
had
to
eat
and
sleep
and
study
my
books
and
every
day
we
went
to
walk
like
tramps
as
you
call
them
he
elucidated
his
face
brightening
with
obvious
delight
at
being
able
for
once
to
explain
matters
in
terms
that
he
felt
sure
would
be
understood
tramps
indeed
muttered
simeon
holly
under
his
breath
then
sharply
did
you
never
perform
any
useful
labor
boy
were
your
days
always
spent
in
this
ungodly
idleness
again
david
frowned
in
mild
wonder
oh
i
was
idle
sir
father
said
i
must
never
be
that
he
said
every
instrument
was
needed
in
the
great
orchestra
of
life
and
that
i
was
one
you
know
even
if
i
was
only
a
little
boy
and
he
said
if
i
kept
still
and
did
do
my
part
the
harmony
would
be
complete
and
yes
yes
but
never
mind
that
now
boy
interrupted
simeon
holly
with
harsh
impatience
i
mean
did
he
never
set
you
to
work
real
work
work
david
meditated
again
then
suddenly
his
face
cleared
oh
yes
sir
he
said
i
had
a
beautiful
work
to
do
and
that
it
was
waiting
for
me
out
in
the
world
that
why
we
came
down
from
the
mountain
you
know
to
find
it
is
that
what
you
mean
well
no
retorted
the
man
i
ca
say
that
it
was
i
was
referring
to
work
real
work
about
the
house
did
you
never
do
any
of
that
david
gave
a
relieved
laugh
oh
you
mean
getting
the
meals
and
tidying
up
the
house
he
replied
oh
yes
i
did
that
with
father
only
his
face
grew
wistful
afraid
i
did
do
it
very
well
my
bacon
was
never
as
nice
and
crisp
as
father
and
the
fire
was
always
spoiling
my
potatoes
humph
bacon
and
potatoes
indeed
scorned
simeon
holly
well
boy
we
call
that
women
work
down
here
we
set
men
to
something
else
do
you
see
that
woodpile
by
the
shed
door
yes
sir
very
good
in
the
kitchen
you
find
an
empty
woodbox
do
you
think
you
could
fill
it
with
wood
from
that
woodpile
you
find
plenty
of
short
small
sticks
already
chopped
oh
yes
sir
i
like
to
nodded
david
hastily
but
carefully
tucking
his
violin
into
its
case
a
minute
later
he
had
attacked
the
woodpile
with
a
will
and
simeon
holly
after
a
sharply
watchful
glance
had
turned
away
but
the
woodbox
after
all
was
not
filled
at
least
it
was
not
filled
immediately
for
at
the
very
beginning
of
gathering
the
second
armful
of
wood
david
picked
up
a
stick
that
had
long
lain
in
one
position
on
the
ground
thereby
disclosing
sundry
and
diverse
crawling
things
of
many
legs
which
filled
david
soul
with
delight
and
drove
away
every
thought
of
the
empty
woodbox
it
was
only
a
matter
of
some
strength
and
more
patience
and
still
more
time
to
overturn
other
and
bigger
sticks
to
find
other
and
bigger
of
the
creatures
one
indeed
was
so
very
wonderful
that
david
with
a
whoop
of
glee
summoned
holly
from
the
shed
doorway
to
come
and
see
so
urgent
was
his
plea
that
holly
came
with
hurried
steps
but
she
went
away
with
steps
even
more
hurried
and
david
sitting
back
on
his
woodpile
seat
was
left
to
wonder
why
she
should
scream
and
shudder
and
say
at
such
a
beautiful
interesting
thing
as
was
this
little
creature
who
lived
in
her
woodpile
even
then
david
did
not
think
of
that
empty
woodbox
waiting
behind
the
kitchen
stove
this
time
it
was
a
butterfly
a
big
black
butterfly
banded
with
gold
and
it
danced
and
fluttered
all
through
the
back
yard
and
out
into
the
garden
david
delightedly
following
with
steps
and
movements
that
would
not
startle
from
the
garden
to
the
orchard
and
from
the
orchard
back
to
the
garden
danced
the
butterfly
and
david
and
in
the
garden
near
the
house
david
came
upon
holly
even
the
butterfly
was
forgotten
then
for
down
in
the
path
by
the
david
dropped
to
his
knees
in
veritable
worship
why
you
just
like
little
people
he
cried
softly
you
got
faces
and
some
of
you
are
happy
and
some
of
you
are
sad
and
you
you
big
spotted
yellow
one
you
laughing
at
me
oh
i
going
to
play
you
all
of
you
you
make
such
a
pretty
song
you
so
different
from
each
other
and
david
leaped
lightly
to
his
feet
and
ran
around
to
the
side
porch
for
his
violin
five
minutes
later
simeon
holly
coming
into
the
kitchen
heard
the
sound
of
a
violin
through
the
open
window
at
the
same
moment
his
eyes
fell
on
the
woodbox
empty
save
for
a
few
small
sticks
at
the
bottom
with
an
angry
frown
he
strode
through
the
outer
door
and
around
the
corner
of
the
house
to
the
garden
at
once
then
he
came
upon
david
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
path
before
the
his
violin
at
his
chin
and
his
whole
face
aglow
well
boy
is
this
the
way
you
fill
the
woodbox
demanded
the
man
crisply
david
shook
his
head
oh
no
sir
this
is
filling
the
woodbox
he
laughed
softening
his
music
but
not
stopping
it
did
you
think
that
was
what
i
was
playing
it
the
flowers
here
that
i
playing
the
little
faces
like
people
you
know
see
this
is
that
big
yellow
one
over
there
laughing
he
finished
letting
the
music
under
his
fingers
burst
into
a
gay
little
melody
simeon
holly
raised
an
imperious
hand
and
at
the
gesture
david
stopped
his
melody
in
the
middle
of
a
run
his
eyes
flying
wide
open
in
plain
wonderment
you
mean
i
not
playing
right
he
asked
i
not
talking
of
your
playing
retorted
simeon
holly
severely
talking
of
that
woodbox
i
asked
you
to
fill
david
face
cleared
oh
yes
sir
i
go
and
do
it
he
nodded
getting
cheerfully
to
his
feet
but
i
told
you
to
do
it
before
david
eyes
grew
puzzled
again
i
know
sir
and
i
started
to
he
answered
with
the
obvious
patience
of
one
who
finds
himself
obliged
to
explain
what
should
be
a
fact
but
i
saw
so
many
beautiful
things
one
after
another
and
when
i
found
these
funny
little
i
just
had
to
play
them
do
you
see
no
i
ca
say
that
i
do
when
i
already
told
you
to
fill
the
woodbox
rejoined
the
man
with
uncompromising
coldness
you
mean
even
then
that
i
ought
to
have
filled
the
woodbox
first
i
certainly
do
david
eyes
flew
wide
open
again
but
my
song
i
have
lost
it
he
exclaimed
and
father
said
always
when
a
song
came
to
me
to
play
it
at
once
songs
are
like
the
mists
of
the
morning
and
the
rainbows
you
know
and
they
do
stay
with
you
long
you
just
have
to
catch
them
quick
before
they
go
now
do
you
see
but
simeon
holly
with
a
despairingly
scornful
gesture
had
turned
away
and
david
after
a
moment
following
him
with
wistful
eyes
soberly
walked
toward
the
kitchen
door
two
minutes
later
he
was
industriously
working
at
his
task
of
filling
the
woodbox
that
for
david
the
affair
was
not
satisfactorily
settled
was
evidenced
by
his
thoughtful
countenance
and
preoccupied
air
however
nor
were
matters
helped
any
by
the
question
david
put
to
holly
just
before
dinner
do
you
mean
he
asked
that
because
i
did
fill
the
woodbox
right
away
i
was
being
a
discord
you
were
what
demanded
the
amazed
simeon
holly
being
a
discord
playing
out
of
tune
you
know
explained
david
with
patient
earnestness
father
said
but
again
simeon
holly
had
turned
irritably
away
and
david
was
left
with
his
perplexed
questions
still
unanswered
chapter
vi
nuisances
necessary
and
otherwise
for
some
time
after
dinner
that
first
day
david
watched
holly
in
silence
while
she
cleared
the
table
and
began
to
wash
the
dishes
do
you
want
me
to
help
he
asked
at
last
a
little
wistfully
holly
with
a
dubious
glance
at
the
boy
brown
little
hands
shook
her
head
no
i
do
no
thank
you
she
amended
her
answer
for
another
sixty
seconds
david
was
silent
then
still
more
wistfully
he
asked
are
all
these
things
you
been
doing
all
day
labor
holly
lifted
dripping
hands
from
the
dishpan
and
held
them
suspended
for
an
amazed
instant
are
they
why
of
course
they
are
what
a
silly
question
what
put
that
idea
into
your
head
child
holly
and
you
see
it
so
different
from
what
father
used
to
call
them
different
yes
he
said
they
were
a
necessary
nuisance
dishes
and
getting
meals
and
clearing
up
and
he
did
do
half
as
many
of
them
as
you
do
either
nuisance
indeed
holly
resumed
her
dishwashing
with
some
asperity
well
i
should
think
that
might
have
been
just
about
like
him
yes
it
was
he
was
always
that
way
nodded
david
pleasantly
then
after
a
moment
he
queried
but
are
you
going
to
walk
at
all
to
walk
where
why
through
the
woods
and
fields
anywhere
walking
in
the
woods
now
just
walking
land
sake
boy
i
got
something
else
to
do
oh
that
too
bad
is
it
david
face
expressed
sympathetic
regret
and
it
such
a
nice
day
maybe
it
rain
by
tomorrow
maybe
it
will
retorted
holly
with
slightly
uplifted
eyebrows
and
an
expressive
glance
but
whether
it
does
or
does
wo
make
any
difference
in
my
going
to
walk
i
guess
oh
wo
it
beamed
david
his
face
changing
i
so
glad
i
mind
the
rain
either
father
and
i
used
to
go
in
the
rain
lots
of
times
only
of
course
we
could
take
our
violins
then
so
we
used
to
like
the
pleasant
days
better
but
there
are
some
things
you
find
on
rainy
days
that
you
could
find
any
other
time
are
there
the
dance
of
the
drops
on
the
leaves
and
the
rush
of
the
rain
when
the
wind
gets
behind
it
do
you
love
to
feel
it
out
in
the
open
spaces
where
the
wind
just
gets
a
good
chance
to
push
holly
stared
then
she
shivered
and
threw
up
her
hands
with
a
gesture
of
hopeless
abandonment
land
sake
boy
she
ejaculated
feebly
as
she
turned
back
to
her
work
from
dishes
to
sweeping
and
from
sweeping
to
dusting
hurried
holly
going
at
last
into
the
somber
parlor
always
carefully
guarded
from
sun
and
air
watching
her
mutely
david
trailed
behind
his
eyes
staring
a
little
as
they
fell
upon
the
multitude
of
objects
that
parlor
contained
the
haircloth
chairs
the
long
sofa
the
table
the
curtains
cushions
spreads
and
throws
the
innumerable
mats
and
tidies
the
the
wax
flowers
under
their
glass
dome
the
dried
grasses
the
marvelous
bouquets
of
scarlet
green
and
purple
everlastings
the
stones
and
shells
and
vases
arranged
as
if
in
line
of
battle
along
the
corner
shelves
y
yes
you
may
come
in
called
holly
glancing
back
at
the
hesitating
boy
in
the
doorway
but
you
must
touch
anything
going
to
dust
but
i
have
seen
this
room
before
ruminated
david
well
no
deigned
holly
with
just
a
touch
of
superiority
we
do
use
this
room
common
little
boy
nor
the
bedroom
there
either
this
is
the
company
room
for
ministers
and
funerals
and
she
stopped
hastily
with
a
quick
look
at
david
but
the
boy
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
and
does
anybody
live
here
in
this
house
but
just
you
and
holly
and
perry
larson
he
asked
still
looking
wonderingly
about
him
no
not
now
holly
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
little
catch
and
glanced
at
the
framed
portrait
of
a
little
boy
on
the
wall
but
you
got
such
a
lot
of
rooms
and
and
things
remarked
david
why
daddy
and
i
only
had
two
rooms
and
not
hardly
any
things
it
was
so
different
you
know
in
my
home
i
should
say
it
might
have
been
holly
began
to
dust
hurriedly
but
carefully
her
voice
still
carried
its
hint
of
superiority
oh
yes
smiled
david
but
you
say
you
do
use
this
room
much
so
that
helps
helps
in
her
stupefaction
holly
stopped
her
work
and
stared
why
yes
i
mean
you
got
so
many
other
rooms
you
can
live
in
those
you
do
have
to
live
in
here
to
live
in
here
ejaculated
the
woman
still
too
uncomprehending
to
be
anything
but
amazed
yes
but
do
you
have
to
keep
all
these
things
and
clean
them
and
clean
them
like
this
every
day
could
you
give
them
to
somebody
or
throw
them
away
throw
these
things
away
with
a
wild
sweep
of
her
arms
the
horrified
woman
seemed
to
be
trying
to
encompass
in
a
protective
embrace
each
last
endangered
treasure
of
mat
and
tidy
boy
are
you
crazy
these
things
are
are
valuable
they
cost
money
and
time
and
and
labor
do
you
know
beautiful
things
when
you
see
them
oh
yes
i
love
beautiful
things
smiled
david
with
unconsciously
rude
emphasis
and
up
on
the
mountain
i
had
them
always
there
was
the
sunrise
and
the
sunset
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
and
my
silver
lake
and
the
that
sailed
but
holly
with
a
vexed
gesture
stopped
him
never
mind
little
boy
i
might
have
known
brought
up
as
you
have
been
of
course
you
could
not
appreciate
such
things
as
these
throw
them
away
indeed
and
she
fell
to
work
again
but
this
time
her
fingers
carried
a
something
in
their
touch
that
was
almost
like
the
caress
a
mother
might
bestow
upon
an
aggrieved
child
david
vaguely
disturbed
and
uncomfortable
watched
her
with
troubled
eyes
then
apologetically
he
explained
it
was
only
that
i
thought
if
you
did
have
to
clean
so
many
of
these
things
you
could
maybe
go
to
walk
more
and
other
days
you
know
you
said
you
did
have
time
he
reminded
her
but
holly
only
shook
her
head
and
sighed
well
well
never
mind
little
boy
i
dare
say
you
meant
all
right
you
could
understand
of
course
and
david
after
another
moment
wistful
eyeing
of
the
caressing
fingers
turned
about
and
wandered
out
onto
the
side
porch
a
minute
later
having
seated
himself
on
the
porch
steps
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
two
small
pieces
of
folded
paper
and
then
through
eyes
he
read
once
more
his
father
letter
he
said
i
must
grieve
for
that
would
grieve
him
murmured
the
boy
after
a
time
his
eyes
on
the
hills
and
he
said
if
play
my
mountains
would
come
to
me
here
and
i
really
be
at
home
up
there
he
said
in
my
violin
were
all
those
things
i
wanting
so
bad
with
a
little
choking
breath
david
tucked
the
note
back
into
his
pocket
and
reached
for
his
violin
some
time
later
holly
dusting
the
chairs
in
the
parlor
stopped
her
work
tiptoed
to
the
door
and
listened
breathlessly
when
she
turned
back
still
later
to
her
work
her
eyes
were
wet
i
wonder
why
when
he
plays
i
always
get
to
thinking
of
john
she
sighed
to
herself
as
she
picked
up
her
after
supper
that
night
simeon
holly
and
his
wife
again
sat
on
the
kitchen
porch
resting
from
the
labor
of
the
day
simeon
eyes
were
closed
his
wife
were
on
the
dim
outlines
of
the
shed
the
barn
the
road
or
a
passing
horse
and
wagon
david
sitting
on
the
steps
was
watching
the
moon
climb
higher
and
higher
above
the
after
a
time
he
slipped
into
the
house
and
came
out
with
his
violin
at
the
first
note
of
sweetness
simeon
holly
opened
his
eyes
and
sat
up
but
his
wife
laid
a
timid
hand
on
his
arm
do
say
anything
please
she
entreated
softly
let
him
play
just
for
he
lonesome
poor
little
fellow
and
simeon
holly
with
a
frowning
shrug
of
his
shoulders
sat
back
in
his
chair
later
it
was
holly
herself
who
stopped
the
music
by
saying
come
david
it
bedtime
for
little
boys
i
go
upstairs
with
you
and
she
led
the
way
into
the
house
and
lighted
the
candle
for
him
upstairs
in
the
little
room
over
the
kitchen
david
found
himself
once
more
alone
as
before
the
little
nightshirt
lay
over
the
and
as
before
holly
had
brushed
away
a
tear
as
she
had
placed
it
there
as
before
too
the
big
bed
loomed
tall
and
formidable
in
the
corner
but
this
time
the
coverlet
and
sheet
were
turned
back
invitingly
holly
had
been
much
disturbed
to
find
that
david
had
slept
on
the
floor
the
night
before
once
more
with
his
back
carefully
turned
toward
the
impaled
bugs
and
moths
on
the
wall
david
undressed
himself
then
before
blowing
out
the
candle
he
went
to
the
window
kneeled
down
and
looked
up
at
the
moon
through
the
trees
david
was
sorely
puzzled
he
was
beginning
to
wonder
just
what
was
to
become
of
himself
his
father
had
said
that
out
in
the
world
there
was
a
beautiful
work
for
him
to
do
but
what
was
it
how
was
he
to
find
it
or
how
was
he
to
do
it
if
he
did
find
it
and
another
thing
where
was
he
to
live
could
he
stay
where
he
was
it
was
not
home
to
be
sure
but
there
was
the
little
room
over
the
kitchen
where
he
might
sleep
and
there
was
the
kind
woman
who
smiled
at
him
sometimes
with
the
sad
look
in
her
eyes
that
somehow
hurt
he
would
not
like
now
to
leave
her
with
daddy
gone
there
were
the
too
and
concerning
these
david
was
equally
puzzled
what
should
he
do
with
them
he
did
not
need
them
the
kind
woman
was
giving
him
plenty
of
food
so
that
he
did
not
have
to
go
to
the
store
and
buy
and
there
was
nothing
else
apparently
that
he
could
use
them
for
they
were
heavy
and
disagreeable
to
carry
yet
he
did
not
like
to
throw
them
away
nor
to
let
anybody
know
that
he
had
them
he
had
been
called
a
thief
just
for
one
little
piece
and
what
would
they
say
if
they
knew
he
had
all
those
others
david
remembered
now
suddenly
that
his
father
had
said
to
hide
them
to
hide
them
until
he
needed
them
david
was
relieved
at
once
why
had
he
not
thought
of
it
before
he
knew
just
the
place
too
the
little
cupboard
behind
the
chimney
there
in
this
very
room
and
with
a
satisfied
sigh
david
got
to
his
feet
gathered
all
the
little
yellow
disks
from
his
pockets
and
tucked
them
well
out
of
sight
behind
the
piles
of
books
on
the
cupboard
shelves
there
too
he
hid
the
watch
but
the
little
miniature
of
the
he
slipped
back
into
one
of
his
pockets
david
second
morning
at
the
farmhouse
was
not
unlike
the
first
except
that
this
time
when
simeon
holly
asked
him
to
fill
the
woodbox
david
resolutely
ignored
every
enticing
bug
and
butterfly
and
kept
rigorously
to
the
task
before
him
until
it
was
done
he
was
in
the
kitchen
when
just
before
dinner
perry
larson
came
into
the
room
with
a
worried
frown
on
his
face
mis
holly
would
ye
mind
just
steppin
to
the
side
door
there
a
woman
an
a
little
boy
there
an
somethin
ails
she
ca
talk
english
an
i
blest
if
i
can
make
head
nor
tail
out
of
the
lingo
she
does
talk
but
maybe
you
can
why
perry
i
do
know
began
holly
but
she
turned
at
once
toward
the
door
on
the
porch
steps
stood
a
very
pretty
but
young
woman
with
a
boy
perhaps
ten
years
old
at
her
side
upon
catching
sight
of
holly
she
burst
into
a
torrent
of
unintelligible
words
supplemented
by
numerous
and
vehement
gestures
holly
shrank
back
and
cast
appealing
eyes
toward
her
husband
who
at
that
moment
had
come
across
the
yard
from
the
barn
simeon
can
you
tell
what
she
wants
at
sight
of
the
newcomer
on
the
scene
the
strange
woman
began
again
with
even
more
volubility
no
said
simeon
holly
after
a
moment
scowling
scrutiny
of
the
gesticulating
woman
she
talking
french
i
think
and
she
wants
something
gosh
i
should
say
she
did
muttered
perry
larson
an
whatever
is
she
wants
it
powerful
bad
are
you
hungry
questioned
holly
timidly
ca
you
speak
english
at
all
demanded
simeon
holly
the
woman
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
the
piteous
pleading
eyes
of
the
stranger
in
the
strange
land
who
can
not
understand
or
make
others
understand
she
had
turned
away
with
a
despairing
shake
of
her
head
when
suddenly
she
gave
a
wild
cry
of
joy
and
wheeled
about
her
whole
face
alight
the
hollys
and
perry
larson
saw
then
that
david
had
come
out
onto
the
porch
and
was
speaking
to
the
woman
and
his
words
were
just
as
unintelligible
as
the
woman
had
been
holly
and
perry
larson
stared
simeon
holly
interrupted
david
with
a
sharp
do
you
then
understand
this
woman
boy
why
yes
did
you
she
lost
her
way
and
but
the
woman
had
hurried
forward
and
was
pouring
her
story
into
david
ears
at
its
conclusion
david
turned
to
find
the
look
of
stupefaction
still
on
the
others
faces
well
what
does
she
want
asked
simeon
holly
crisply
she
wants
to
find
the
way
to
francois
lavelle
house
he
her
husband
brother
she
came
in
on
the
train
this
morning
her
husband
stopped
off
a
minute
somewhere
she
says
and
got
left
behind
he
could
talk
english
but
she
ca

in
this
country
a
week
she
came
from
france

cried
perry
larson
admiringly
reads
her
just
like

book

french
family
over
in
west
hinsdale
two
of
i
think
what
ye
bet
ai
one
them
very
likely
acceded
simeon
holly
his
eyes
bent
disapprovingly
on
david
face
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
simeon
holly
attention
was
occupied
by
david
not
the
woman
an
say
holly
resumed
perry
larson
a
little
excitedly
you
know
i
was
goin
over
ter
west
hinsdale
in
a
day
or
two
ter
see
harlow
about
them
steers
why
ca
i

this
afternoon
an
tote
her
an
the
kid
along
very
well
nodded
simeon
holly
curtly
his
eyes
still
on
david
face
perry
larson
turned
to
the
woman
and
by
a
flourish
of
his
arms
and
a
jumble
of
broken
english
attempted
to
make
her
understand
that
he
was
to
take
her
where
she
undoubtedly
wished
to
go
the
woman
still
looked
uncomprehending
however
and
david
promptly
came
to
the
rescue
saying
a
few
rapid
words
that
quickly
brought
a
flood
of
delighted
understanding
to
the
woman
face
ca
you
ask
her
if
she
hungry
ventured
holly
then
she
says
no
thank
you
translated
david
with
a
smile
when
he
had
received
his
answer
but
the
boy
says
he
is
if
you
please
then
tell
them
to
come
into
the
kitchen
directed
holly
hurrying
into
the
house
so
you
french
are
you
said
simeon
holly
to
david
french
oh
no
sir
smiled
david
proudly
i
an
american
father
said
i
was
he
said
i
was
born
in
this
country
but
how
comes
it
you
can
speak
french
like
that
why
i
learned
it
then
divining
that
his
words
were
still
unconvincing
he
added
same
as
i
learned
german
and
other
things
with
father
out
of
books
you
know
did
you
learn
french
when
you
were
a
little
boy
humph
vouchsafed
simeon
holly
stalking
away
without
answering
the
question
immediately
after
dinner
perry
larson
drove
away
with
the
woman
and
the
little
boy
the
woman
face
was
wreathed
with
smiles
and
her
last
adoring
glance
was
for
david
waving
his
hand
to
her
from
the
porch
steps
in
the
afternoon
david
took
his
violin
and
went
off
toward
the
hill
behind
the
house
for
a
walk
he
had
asked
holly
to
accompany
him
but
she
had
refused
though
she
was
not
sweeping
or
dusting
at
the
time
she
was
doing
nothing
more
important
apparently
than
making
holes
in
a
piece
of
white
cloth
and
sewing
them
up
again
with
a
needle
and
thread
david
had
then
asked
holly
to
go
but
his
refusal
was
even
more
strangely
impatient
than
his
wife
had
been
and
why
pray
should
i
go
for
a
useless
walk
now
or
any
time
for
that
matter
he
demanded
sharply
david
had
shrunk
back
unconsciously
though
he
had
still
smiled
oh
but
it
would
be
a
useless
walk
sir
father
said
nothing
was
useless
that
helped
to
keep
us
in
tune
you
know
in
tune
i
mean
you
looked
as
father
used
to
look
sometimes
when
he
felt
out
of
tune
and
he
always
said
there
was
nothing
like
a
walk
to
put
him
back
again
i
i
was
feeling
a
little
out
of
tune
myself
and
i
thought
by
the
way
you
looked
that
you
were
too
so
i
asked
you
to
go
to
walk
humph
well
i
that
will
do
boy
no
impertinence
you
understand
and
he
had
turned
away
in
very
obvious
anger
david
with
a
puzzled
sorrow
in
his
heart
had
started
alone
then
on
his
walk
chapter
vii
you
wanted
you
wanted
it
was
saturday
night
and
the
end
of
david
third
day
at
the
farmhouse
upstairs
in
the
hot
little
room
over
the
kitchen
the
boy
knelt
at
the
window
and
tried
to
find
a
breath
of
cool
air
from
the
hills
downstairs
on
the
porch
simeon
holly
and
his
wife
discussed
the
events
of
the
past
few
days
and
talked
of
what
should
be
done
with
david
but
what
shall
we
do
with
him
moaned
holly
at
last
breaking
a
long
silence
that
had
fallen
between
them
what
can
we
do
with
him
does
anybody
want
him
no
of
course
nobody
wants
him
retorted
her
husband
relentlessly
and
at
the
words
a
small
figure
in
a
nightshirt
stopped
short
david
violin
in
hand
had
fled
from
the
little
hot
room
and
stood
now
just
inside
the
kitchen
door
who
can
want
a
child
that
has
been
brought
up
in
that
heathenish
fashion
continued
simeon
holly
according
to
his
own
story
even
his
father
did
nothing
but
play
the
fiddle
and
tramp
through
the
woods
day
in
and
day
out
with
an
occasional
trip
to
the
mountain
village
to
get
food
and
clothing
when
they
had
absolutely
nothing
to
eat
and
wear
of
course
nobody
wants
him
david
at
the
kitchen
door
caught
his
breath
chokingly
then
he
sped
across
the
floor
to
the
back
hall
and
on
through
the
long
sheds
to
the
hayloft
in
the
barn
the
place
where
his
father
seemed
always
nearest
david
was
frightened
and
heartsick
nobody
wanted
him
he
had
heard
it
with
his
own
ears
so
there
was
no
mistake
what
now
about
all
those
long
days
and
nights
ahead
before
he
might
go
violin
in
hand
to
meet
his
father
in
that
country
how
was
he
to
live
those
days
and
nights
if
nobody
wanted
him
how
was
his
violin
to
speak
in
a
voice
that
was
true
and
pure
and
full
and
tell
of
the
beautiful
world
as
his
father
had
said
that
it
must
do
david
quite
cried
aloud
at
the
thought
then
he
thought
of
something
else
that
his
father
had
said
remember
this
my
boy
in
your
violin
lie
all
the
things
you
long
for
you
have
only
to
play
and
the
broad
skies
of
your
mountain
home
will
be
over
you
and
the
dear
friends
and
comrades
of
your
mountain
forests
will
be
all
about
you
with
a
quick
cry
david
raised
his
violin
and
drew
the
bow
across
the
strings
back
on
the
porch
at
that
moment
holly
was
saying
of
course
there
the
orphan
asylum
or
maybe
the
poorhouse
if
take
him
but
simeon
she
broke
off
sharply
where
that
child
playing
now
simeon
listened
with
intent
ears
in
the
barn
i
should
say
but
he
gone
to
bed
and
he
go
to
bed
again
asserted
simeon
holly
grimly
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stalked
across
the
moonlit
yard
to
the
barn
as
before
holly
followed
him
and
as
before
both
involuntarily
paused
just
inside
the
barn
door
to
listen
no
runs
and
trills
and
rollicking
bits
of
melody
floated
down
the
stairway
the
notes
were
and
plaintively
sweet
and
they
rose
and
swelled
and
died
almost
into
silence
while
the
man
and
the
woman
by
the
door
stood
listening
they
were
back
in
the
long
ago
simeon
holly
and
his
wife
back
with
a
boy
of
their
own
who
had
made
those
same
rafters
ring
with
shouts
of
laughter
and
who
also
had
played
the
violin
though
not
like
this
and
the
same
thought
had
come
to
each
what
if
after
all
it
were
john
playing
all
alone
in
the
moonlight
it
had
not
been
the
violin
in
the
end
that
had
driven
john
holly
from
home
it
had
been
the
possibilities
in
a
piece
of
crayon
all
through
childhood
the
boy
had
drawn
his
beloved
pictures
on
every
inviting
space
that
offered
whether
it
were
the
or
the
fly
leaf
of
the
big
plush
album
and
at
eighteen
he
had
announced
his
determination
to
be
an
artist
for
a
year
after
that
simeon
holly
fought
with
all
the
strength
of
a
stubborn
will
banished
chalk
and
crayon
from
the
house
and
set
the
boy
to
homely
tasks
that
left
no
time
for
anything
but
food
and
sleep
then
john
ran
away
that
was
fifteen
years
ago
and
they
had
not
seen
him
since
though
two
unanswered
letters
in
simeon
holly
desk
testified
that
perhaps
this
at
least
was
not
the
boy
fault
it
was
not
of
the
john
the
willful
boy
and
runaway
son
however
that
simeon
holly
and
his
wife
were
thinking
as
they
stood
just
inside
the
barn
door
it
was
of
baby
john
the
little
fellow
that
had
played
at
their
knees
frolicked
in
this
very
barn
and
nestled
in
their
arms
when
the
day
was
done
holly
spoke
first
and
it
was
not
as
she
had
spoken
on
the
porch
simeon
she
began
tremulously
that
dear
child
must
go
to
bed
and
she
hurried
across
the
floor
and
up
the
stairs
followed
by
her
husband
come
david
she
said
as
she
reached
the
top
it
time
little
boys
were
asleep
come
her
voice
was
low
and
not
quite
steady
to
david
her
voice
sounded
as
her
eyes
looked
when
there
was
in
them
the
something
that
hurt
very
slowly
he
came
forward
into
the
moonlight
his
gaze
searching
the
woman
face
long
and
earnestly
and
do
you
want
me
he
faltered
the
woman
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
little
sob
before
her
stood
the
slender
figure
in
the
gown
john
gown
into
her
eyes
looked
those
other
eyes
dark
and
wistful
like
john
eyes
and
her
arms
ached
with
emptiness
yes
yes
for
my
very
own
and
for
always
she
cried
with
sudden
passion
clasping
the
little
form
close
for
always
and
david
sighed
his
content
simeon
holly
lips
parted
but
they
closed
again
with
no
words
said
the
man
turned
then
with
a
curiously
baffled
look
and
stalked
down
the
stairs
on
the
porch
long
minutes
later
when
once
more
david
had
gone
to
bed
simeon
holly
said
coldly
to
his
wife
i
suppose
you
realize
ellen
just
what
you
pledged
yourself
to
by
that
absurd
outburst
of
yours
in
the
barn
and
all
because
that
ungodly
music
and
the
moonshine
had
gone
to
your
head
but
i
want
the
boy
simeon
he
he
makes
me
think
of
john
harsh
lines
came
to
the
man
mouth
but
there
was
a
perceptible
shake
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
we
not
talking
of
john
ellen
we
talking
of
this
irresponsible
hardly
sane
boy
upstairs
he
can
work
i
suppose
if
he
taught
and
in
that
way
he
wo
perhaps
be
a
dead
loss
still
he
another
mouth
to
feed
and
that
counts
now
there
the
note
you
know
it
due
in
august
but
you
say
there
money
almost
enough
for
it
in
the
bank
holly
voice
was
anxiously
apologetic
yes
i
know
vouchsafed
the
man
but
almost
enough
is
not
quite
enough
but
there
time
more
than
two
months
it
is
due
till
the
last
of
august
simeon
i
know
i
know
meanwhile
there
the
boy
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
why
ca
you
use
him
on
the
farm
a
little
perhaps
i
doubt
it
though
gloomed
the
man
one
ca
hoe
corn
nor
pull
weeds
with
a
and
that
all
he
seems
to
know
how
to
handle
but
he
can
learn
and
he
does
play
beautifully
murmured
the
woman
whenever
before
had
ellen
holly
ventured
to
use
words
of
argument
with
her
husband
and
in
extenuation
too
of
an
act
of
her
own
there
was
no
reply
except
a
muttered
humph
under
the
breath
then
simeon
holly
rose
and
stalked
into
the
house
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
sunday
at
the
farmhouse
was
a
thing
of
stern
repression
and
solemn
silence
in
simeon
holly
veins
ran
the
blood
of
the
puritans
and
he
was
more
than
strict
as
to
what
he
considered
right
and
wrong
when
for
the
ministry
had
forced
him
to
resort
to
a
less
confining
life
though
never
had
it
taken
from
him
the
uncompromising
rigor
of
his
views
it
was
a
distinct
shock
to
him
therefore
on
this
sunday
morning
to
be
awakened
by
a
peal
of
music
such
as
the
little
house
had
never
known
before
all
the
while
that
he
was
thrusting
his
indignant
self
into
his
clothing
the
runs
and
turns
and
crashing
chords
whirled
about
him
until
it
seemed
that
a
whole
orchestra
must
be
imprisoned
in
the
little
room
over
the
kitchen
so
skillful
was
the
boy
double
stopping
simeon
holly
was
white
with
anger
when
he
finally
hurried
down
the
hall
and
threw
open
david
bedroom
door
boy
what
do
you
mean
by
this
he
demanded
david
laughed
gleefully
and
did
you
know
he
asked
why
i
thought
my
music
would
tell
you
i
was
so
happy
so
glad
the
birds
in
the
trees
woke
me
up
singing
wanted
you
wanted
and
the
sun
came
over
the
hill
there
and
said
wanted
you
wanted
and
the
little
tapped
on
my
window
pane
and
said
wanted
wanted
and
i
just
had
to
take
up
my
violin
and
tell
you
about
it
but
it
sunday
the
lord
day
remonstrated
the
man
sternly
david
stood
motionless
his
eyes
questioning
are
you
quite
a
heathen
then
catechised
the
man
sharply
have
they
never
told
you
anything
about
god
boy
oh
of
course
smiled
david
in
open
relief
god
wraps
up
the
buds
in
their
little
brown
blankets
and
covers
the
roots
with
i
am
not
talking
about
brown
blankets
nor
roots
interrupted
the
man
severely
this
is
god
day
and
as
such
should
be
kept
holy
yes
you
should
not
fiddle
nor
laugh
nor
sing
but
those
are
good
things
and
beautiful
things
defended
david
his
eyes
wide
and
puzzled
in
their
place
perhaps
conceded
the
man
stiffly
but
not
on
day
you
mean
he
would
like
them
yes
oh
and
david
face
cleared
that
all
right
then
your
god
is
the
same
one
sir
for
mine
loves
all
beautiful
things
every
day
in
the
year
there
was
a
moment
silence
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
simeon
holly
found
himself
without
words
we
wo
talk
of
this
any
more
david
he
said
at
last
but
put
it
another
way
i
do
wish
you
to
play
your
fiddle
on
sunday
now
put
it
up
till
and
he
turned
and
went
down
the
hall
breakfast
was
a
very
quiet
meal
that
morning
meals
were
never
things
of
hilarious
joy
at
the
holly
farmhouse
as
david
had
already
found
out
but
he
had
not
seen
one
before
quite
so
somber
as
this
it
was
followed
immediately
by
a
of
and
prayer
with
holly
and
perry
larson
sitting
very
stiff
and
solemn
in
their
chairs
while
holly
read
david
tried
to
sit
very
stiff
and
solemn
in
his
chair
also
but
the
roses
at
the
window
were
nodding
their
heads
and
beckoning
and
the
birds
in
the
bushes
beyond
were
sending
to
him
coaxing
little
chirps
of
come
out
come
out
and
how
could
one
expect
to
sit
stiff
and
solemn
in
the
face
of
all
that
particularly
when
one
fingers
were
tingling
to
take
up
the
interrupted
song
of
the
morning
and
tell
the
whole
world
how
beautiful
it
was
to
be
wanted
yet
david
sat
very
still
or
as
still
as
he
could
sit
and
only
the
tapping
of
his
foot
and
the
roving
of
his
wistful
eyes
told
that
his
mind
was
not
with
farmer
holly
and
the
children
of
israel
in
their
wanderings
in
the
wilderness
after
the
devotions
came
an
hour
of
subdued
haste
and
confusion
while
the
family
prepared
for
church
david
had
never
been
to
church
he
asked
perry
larson
what
it
was
like
but
perry
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
to
nobody
apparently
sugar
wo
ye
hear
that
now
which
to
david
was
certainly
no
answer
at
all
that
one
must
be
spick
and
span
to
go
to
church
david
soon
found
out
never
before
had
he
been
so
scrubbed
and
brushed
and
combed
there
was
too
brought
out
for
him
to
wear
a
little
clean
white
blouse
and
a
red
tie
over
which
holly
cried
a
little
as
she
had
over
the
nightshirt
that
first
evening
the
church
was
in
the
village
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
in
due
time
david
and
interested
was
following
and
holly
down
its
long
center
aisle
the
hollys
were
early
as
usual
and
service
had
not
begun
even
the
organist
had
not
taken
his
seat
beneath
the
great
pipes
of
blue
and
gold
that
towered
to
the
ceiling
it
was
the
pride
of
the
town
that
organ
it
had
been
given
by
a
great
man
out
in
the
world
whose
birthplace
the
town
was
more
than
that
a
yearly
donation
from
this
same
great
man
paid
for
the
skilled
organist
who
came
every
sunday
from
the
city
to
play
it
as
the
organist
took
his
seat
he
noticed
a
new
face
in
the
holly
pew
and
he
almost
gave
a
friendly
smile
as
he
met
the
wondering
gaze
of
the
small
boy
there
then
he
lost
himself
as
usual
in
the
music
before
him
down
in
the
holly
pew
the
small
boy
held
his
breath
a
score
of
violins
were
singing
in
his
ears
and
a
score
of
other
instruments
that
he
could
not
name
crashed
over
his
head
and
brought
him
to
his
feet
in
ecstasy
before
a
detaining
hand
could
stop
him
he
was
out
in
the
aisle
his
eyes
on
the
pipes
from
which
seemed
to
come
those
wondrous
sounds
then
his
gaze
fell
on
the
man
and
on
the
banks
of
keys
and
with
soft
steps
he
crept
along
the
aisle
and
up
the
stairs
to
the
for
long
minutes
he
stood
motionless
listening
then
the
music
died
into
silence
and
the
minister
rose
for
the
invocation
it
was
a
voice
and
not
a
man
however
that
broke
the
pause
oh
sir
please
it
said
would
you
could
you
teach
me
to
do
that
the
organist
choked
over
a
cough
and
the
soprano
reached
out
and
drew
david
to
her
side
whispering
something
in
his
ear
the
minister
after
a
dazed
silence
bowed
his
head
while
down
in
the
holly
pew
an
angry
man
and
a
sorely
mortified
woman
vowed
that
before
david
came
to
church
again
he
should
have
learned
some
things
chapter
viii
the
puzzling
dos
and
with
the
coming
of
monday
arrived
a
new
life
for
david
a
curious
life
full
of
and
dos
david
wondered
sometimes
why
all
the
pleasant
things
were
and
all
the
unpleasant
ones
dos
corn
to
be
hoed
weeds
to
be
pulled
woodboxes
to
be
filled
with
all
these
it
was
do
this
do
this
do
this
but
when
it
came
to
lying
under
the
apple
trees
exploring
the
brook
that
ran
by
the
field
or
even
watching
the
bugs
and
worms
that
one
found
in
the
earth
all
these
were
as
to
farmer
holly
farmer
holly
himself
awoke
to
some
new
experiences
that
monday
morning
one
of
them
was
the
difficulty
in
successfully
combating
the
cheerfully
expressed
opinion
that
weeds
were
so
pretty
growing
that
it
was
a
pity
to
pull
them
up
and
let
them
all
wither
and
die
another
was
the
equally
great
difficulty
of
keeping
a
small
boy
at
useful
labor
of
any
sort
in
the
face
of
the
attractions
displayed
by
a
passing
cloud
a
blossoming
shrub
or
a
bird
singing
on
a
in
spite
of
all
this
however
david
so
evidently
did
his
best
to
carry
out
the
dos
and
avoid
the
that
at
four
that
first
monday
he
won
from
the
stern
but
farmer
holly
his
freedom
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
very
gayly
he
set
off
for
a
walk
he
went
without
his
violin
as
there
was
the
smell
of
rain
in
the
air
but
his
face
and
his
step
and
the
very
swing
of
his
arms
were
singing
to
david
the
joyous
song
of
the
morning
before
even
yet
in
spite
of
the
vicissitudes
of
the
day
work
the
whole
world
to
david
homesick
lonely
little
heart
was
still
caroling
that
blessed
you
wanted
you
wanted
you
wanted
and
then
he
saw
the
crow
david
knew
crows
in
his
home
on
the
mountain
he
had
had
several
of
them
for
friends
he
had
learned
to
know
and
answer
their
calls
he
had
learned
to
admire
their
wisdom
and
to
respect
their
moods
and
tempers
he
loved
to
watch
them
especially
he
loved
to
see
the
great
birds
cut
through
the
air
with
a
wide
sweep
of
wings
so
alive
so
gloriously
free
but
this
crow
this
crow
was
not
cutting
through
the
air
with
a
wide
sweep
of
wing
it
was
in
the
middle
of
a
cornfield
and
it
was
rising
and
falling
and
flopping
about
in
a
most
extraordinary
fashion
very
soon
david
running
toward
it
saw
why
by
a
long
leather
strip
it
was
fastened
securely
to
a
stake
in
the
ground
oh
oh
oh
exclaimed
david
in
sympathetic
consternation
here
you
just
wait
a
minute
i
fix
it
with
confident
celerity
david
whipped
out
his
jackknife
to
cut
the
thong
but
he
found
then
that
to
fix
it
and
to
say
he
would
fix
it
were
two
different
matters
the
crow
did
not
seem
to
recognize
in
david
a
friend
he
saw
in
him
apparently
but
another
of
the
torturing
humans
who
were
responsible
for
his
present
hateful
captivity
with
beak
and
claw
and
wing
therefore
he
fought
this
new
evil
that
had
come
presumedly
to
torment
and
not
until
david
had
hit
upon
the
expedient
of
taking
off
his
blouse
and
throwing
it
over
the
angry
bird
could
the
boy
get
near
enough
to
accomplish
his
purpose
even
then
david
had
to
leave
upon
the
slender
leg
a
twist
of
leather
a
moment
later
with
a
whir
of
wings
and
a
frightened
squawk
that
quickly
turned
into
a
surprised
caw
of
triumphant
rejoicing
the
crow
soared
into
the
air
and
made
straight
for
a
distant
david
after
a
minute
glad
surveying
of
his
work
donned
his
blouse
again
and
resumed
his
walk
it
was
almost
six
when
david
got
back
to
the
holly
farmhouse
in
the
barn
doorway
sat
perry
larson
well
sonny
the
man
greeted
him
cheerily
did
ye
get
yer
done
y
yes
hesitated
david
i
got
it
done
but
i
did
like
it
is
kinder
hot
work
oh
i
did
mind
that
part
returned
david
what
i
did
like
was
pulling
up
all
those
pretty
little
plants
and
letting
them
die
weeds
little
plants
ejaculated
the
man
well
i
be
jiggered
but
they
were
pretty
defended
david
reading
aright
the
scorn
in
perry
larson
voice
the
very
prettiest
and
biggest
there
were
always
holly
showed
me
you
know
and
i
had
to
pull
them
up
well
i

jiggered
muttered
perry
larson
again
but
i
been
to
walk
since
i
feel
better
now
oh
ye
do
oh
yes
i
had
a
splendid
walk
i
went
up
in
the
woods
on
the
hill
there
i
was
singing
all
the
time
inside
you
know
i
was
so
glad
holly
wanted
me
you
know
what
it
is
when
you

inside
perry
larson
scratched
his
head
well
no
sonny
i
ca

do
he
retorted
i
ai
much
on
singin
oh
but
i
do
mean
aloud
i
mean
inside
when
you
happy
you
know
when
i
oh
the
man
stopped
and
stared
his
mouth
falling
open
suddenly
his
face
changed
and
he
grinned
appreciatively
well
if
you
ai
the
beat
boy
is
kinder
like
singin
the
way
ye
feel
inside
when
yer
happy
ai
it
but
i
never

that
where

get
my
songs
inside
of
me
you
know
that
i
play
on
my
violin
and
i
made
a
crow
sing
too
only
he
sang
outside

a
crow
scoffed
the
man
shucks
it
take
more
you
ter
make
me
think
a
crow
can
sing
my
lad
but
they
do
when
they
happy
maintained
the
boy
anyhow
it
does
sound
the
same
as
it
does
when
they
cross
or
plagued
over
something
you
ought
to
have
heard
this
one
he
sang
he
was
so
glad
to
get
away
i
let
him
loose
you
see
you
mean
you
caught
a
crow
up
there
in
them
woods
the
man
voice
was
skeptical
oh
no
i
did
catch
it
but
somebody
had
and
tied
him
up
and
he
was
so
unhappy
a
crow
tied
up
in
the
woods
oh
i
did
find
that
in
the
woods
it
was
before
i
went
up
the
hill
at
all

crow
tied
up

are
you
talkin
about
where

that
crow

larson

suddenly
alert
in
the
field
over
there
and
somebody
the
cornfield
jingo
boy
you
do
mean
you
touched
that
crow
well
he
would
let
me
touch
him
david
he
was
so
afraid

why
i
had
to
put
my
blouse
over
his
head
before
let
me
cut
him
loose
at
all
cut
him
loose
perry
larson
sprang
to
his
feet
you
did
you
did
let
that
crow
go
david
shrank
back
why
yes
he
wanted
to
go
he
but
the
man
before
him
had
fallen
back
despairingly
to
his
old
position
well

just
like
that
he
finished
snapping
his
fingers
angrily
in
david
face
there

no
contrition
there
was
only
incredulous
horror
you
mean
you
tied
him
there
on
purpose
sure
i

but
he
did
like

big
wings
that
could
carry
you
to
the
top
of
that
big
tree
there
and
away
up
up
in
the
sky
where
you
could
talk
to
the
stars
would
you
pull
if
somebody
a
hundred
times
you
came
along
and
tied
your
leg
to
that
post
there

man

angry

ter
have

along
an
with

oh

sorry

but
that
wo

my
crow
david
face
brightened
no
that
so
is
it
i
glad
of
that
i
was
thinking
of
the
crows
you
see
i
so
sorry
for
them
only
think
how
we
hate
to
be
tied
like
that
but
perry
larson
with
a
stare
and
an
indignant
snort
had
got
to
his
feet
and
was
rapidly
walking
toward
the
house
very
plainly
that
evening
david
was
in
disgrace
and
it
took
all
of
holly
tact
and
patience
and
some
private
pleading
to
keep
a
general
explosion
from
wrecking
all
chances
of
his
staying
longer
at
the
farmhouse
even
as
it
was
david
was
sorrowfully
aware
that
he
was
proving
to
be
a
great
disappointment
so
soon
and
his
violin
playing
that
evening
carried
a
moaning
plaintiveness
that
would
have
been
very
significant
to
one
who
knew
david
well
very
faithfully
the
next
day
the
boy
tried
to
carry
out
all
the
dos
and
though
he
did
not
always
succeed
yet
his
efforts
were
so
obvious
that
even
the
indignant
owner
of
the
liberated
crow
was
somewhat
mollified
and
again
simeon
holly
released
david
from
work
at
four
alas
for
david
peace
of
mind
however
for
on
his
walk
though
he
found
no
captive
crow
to
demand
his
sympathy
he
found
something
else
quite
as
heartrending
and
as
incomprehensible
it
was
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
that
he
came
upon
two
boys
each
carrying
a
rifle
a
dead
squirrel
and
a
dead
rabbit
the
threatened
rain
of
the
day
before
had
not
materialized
and
david
had
his
violin
he
had
been
playing
softly
when
he
came
upon
the
boys
where
the
path
entered
the
woods
oh
at
sight
of
the
boys
and
their
burden
david
gave
an
involuntary
cry
and
stopped
playing
the
boys
scarcely
less
surprised
at
sight
of
david
and
his
violin
paused
and
stared
frankly
it
the
tramp
kid
with
his
fiddle
whispered
one
to
the
other
huskily
david
his
grieved
eyes
on
the
motionless
little
bodies
in
the
hands
shuddered
are
they
dead
too
the
bigger
boy
nodded
sure
we
just
shot
the
squirrels
ben
here
trapped
the
rabbits
he
paused
manifestly
waiting
for
the
proper
awed
admiration
to
come
into
david
face
but
in
david
startled
eyes
there
was
no
awed
admiration
there
was
only
disbelieving
horror
you
mean
you
sent
them
to
the
far
country
we
what
sent
them
made
them
go
yourselves
to
the
far
country
the
younger
boy
still
stared
the
older
one
grinned
disagreeably
sure
he
answered
with
laconic
indifference
we
sent
to
the
far
country
all
right
but
how
did
you
know
they
wanted
to
go
wanted
eh
exploded
the
big
boy
then
he
grinned
again
still
more
disagreeably
well
you
see
my
dear
we
did
ask
he
gibed
real
distress
came
into
david
face
then
you
do
know
at
all
and
maybe
they
did
want
to
go
and
if
they
did
how
could
they
go
singing
as
father
said
father
sent
he
went
and
he
went
singing
he
said
he
did
but
these
how
would
you
like
to
have
somebody
come
along
and
send
you
to
the
far
country
without
even
knowing
if
you
wanted
to
go
there
was
no
answer
the
boys
with
a
growing
fear
in
their
eyes
as
at
sight
of
something
inexplicable
and
uncanny
were
sidling
away
and
in
a
moment
they
were
hurrying
down
the
hill
not
however
without
a
backward
glance
or
two
of
something
very
like
terror
david
left
alone
went
on
his
way
with
troubled
eyes
and
a
thoughtful
frown
david
often
wore
during
those
first
few
days
at
the
holly
farmhouse
a
thoughtful
face
and
a
troubled
frown
there
were
so
many
many
things
that
were
different
from
his
mountain
home
over
and
over
as
those
first
long
days
passed
he
read
his
letter
until
he
knew
it
by
heart
and
he
had
need
to
was
he
not
already
surrounded
by
things
and
people
that
were
strange
to
him
and
they
were
so
very
strange
these
people
there
were
the
boys
and
men
who
rose
at
dawn
yet
never
paused
to
watch
the
sun
flood
the
world
with
light
who
stayed
in
the
fields
all
day
yet
never
raised
their
eyes
to
the
big
fleecy
clouds
overhead
who
knew
birds
only
as
thieves
after
fruit
and
grain
and
squirrels
and
rabbits
only
as
creatures
to
be
trapped
or
shot
the
women
they
were
even
more
incomprehensible
they
spent
the
long
hours
behind
screened
doors
and
windows
washing
the
same
dishes
and
sweeping
the
same
floors
day
after
day
they
too
never
raised
their
eyes
to
the
blue
sky
outside
nor
even
to
the
crimson
roses
that
peeped
in
at
the
window
they
seemed
rather
to
be
looking
always
for
dirt
yet
not
pleased
when
they
found
it
especially
if
it
had
been
tracked
in
on
the
heel
of
a
small
boy
shoe
more
extraordinary
than
all
this
to
david
however
was
the
fact
that
these
people
regarded
him
not
themselves
as
being
strange
as
if
it
were
not
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
live
with
one
father
in
one
home
on
the
and
spend
one
days
trailing
through
the
forest
paths
or
lying
with
a
book
beside
some
babbling
little
stream
as
if
it
were
not
equally
natural
to
take
one
violin
with
one
at
times
and
learn
to
catch
upon
the
quivering
strings
the
whisper
of
the
winds
through
the
trees
even
in
winter
when
the
clouds
themselves
came
down
from
the
sky
and
covered
the
earth
with
their
soft
whiteness
even
then
the
forest
was
beautiful
and
the
song
of
the
brook
under
its
icy
coat
carried
a
charm
and
mystery
that
were
quite
wanting
in
the
chattering
freedom
of
summer
surely
there
was
nothing
strange
in
all
this
and
yet
these
people
seemed
to
think
there
was
chapter
ix
joe
day
by
day
however
as
time
passed
david
diligently
tried
to
perform
the
dos
and
avoid
the
and
day
by
day
he
came
to
realize
how
important
weeds
and
woodboxes
were
if
he
were
to
conform
to
what
was
evidently
farmer
holly
idea
of
playing
in
tune
in
this
strange
new
orchestra
of
life
in
which
he
found
himself
but
try
as
he
would
there
was
yet
an
unreality
about
it
all
a
persistent
feeling
of
uselessness
and
waste
that
would
not
be
set
aside
so
that
after
all
the
only
part
of
this
strange
new
life
of
his
that
seemed
real
to
him
was
the
time
that
came
after
four
each
day
when
he
was
released
from
work
and
how
full
he
filled
those
hours
there
was
so
much
to
see
so
much
to
do
for
sunny
days
there
were
field
and
stream
and
pasture
land
and
the
whole
wide
town
to
explore
for
rainy
days
if
he
did
not
care
to
go
to
walk
there
was
his
room
with
the
books
in
the
chimney
cupboard
some
of
them
david
had
read
before
but
many
of
them
he
had
not
one
or
two
were
old
friends
but
not
so
dare
devil
dick
and
the
pirates
of
pigeon
cove
which
he
found
hidden
in
an
obscure
corner
behind
a
loose
board
side
by
side
stood
the
lady
of
the
lake
treasure
island
and
david
copperfield
and
coverless
and
dogeared
lay
robinson
crusoe
the
arabian
nights
and
grimm
fairy
tales
there
were
more
many
more
and
david
devoured
them
all
with
eager
eyes
the
good
in
them
he
absorbed
as
he
absorbed
the
sunshine
the
evil
he
cast
aside
unconsciously
it
rolled
off
indeed
like
the
proverbial
water
from
the
duck
back
david
hardly
knew
sometimes
which
he
liked
the
better
his
imaginative
adventures
between
the
covers
of
his
books
or
his
real
adventures
in
his
daily
strolls
true
it
was
not
his
mountain
home
this
place
in
which
he
found
himself
neither
was
there
anywhere
his
silver
lake
with
its
far
sky
above
more
deplorable
yet
nowhere
was
there
the
dear
father
he
loved
so
well
but
the
sun
still
set
in
rose
and
gold
and
the
sky
though
small
still
carried
the
snowy
sails
of
its
while
as
to
his
father
his
father
had
told
him
not
to
grieve
and
david
was
trying
very
hard
to
obey
with
his
violin
for
company
david
started
out
each
day
unless
he
elected
to
stay
indoors
with
his
books
sometimes
it
was
toward
the
village
that
he
turned
his
steps
sometimes
it
was
toward
the
hills
back
of
the
town
whichever
way
it
was
there
was
always
sure
to
be
something
waiting
at
the
end
for
him
and
his
violin
to
discover
if
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
big
white
rose
in
bloom
or
a
squirrel
sitting
by
the
roadside
very
soon
however
david
discovered
that
there
was
something
to
be
found
in
his
wanderings
besides
squirrels
and
roses
and
that
was
people
in
spite
of
the
strangeness
of
these
people
they
were
wonderfully
interesting
david
thought
and
after
that
he
turned
his
steps
more
and
more
frequently
toward
the
village
when
four
released
him
from
the
day
work
at
first
david
did
not
talk
much
to
these
people
he
shrank
sensitively
from
their
bold
stares
and
unpleasantly
audible
comments
he
watched
them
with
round
eyes
of
wonder
and
interest
however
when
he
did
not
think
they
were
watching
him
and
in
time
he
came
to
know
not
a
little
about
them
and
about
the
strange
ways
in
which
they
passed
their
time
there
was
the
greenhouse
man
it
would
be
pleasant
to
spend
one
day
growing
plants
and
flowers
but
not
under
that
hot
stifling
glass
roof
decided
david
besides
he
would
not
want
always
to
pick
and
send
away
the
very
prettiest
ones
to
the
city
every
morning
as
the
greenhouse
man
did
there
was
the
doctor
who
rode
all
day
long
behind
the
gray
mare
making
sick
folks
well
david
liked
him
and
mentally
vowed
that
he
himself
would
be
a
doctor
sometime
still
there
was
the
david
was
not
sure
but
he
would
prefer
to
follow
this
man
profession
for
a
for
in
his
one
could
still
have
the
freedom
of
long
days
in
the
open
and
yet
not
be
saddened
by
the
sight
of
the
sick
before
they
had
been
made
well
which
was
where
the
had
the
better
of
the
doctor
in
david
opinion
there
were
the
blacksmith
and
the
storekeepers
too
but
to
these
david
gave
little
thought
or
attention
though
he
might
not
know
what
he
did
want
to
do
he
knew
very
well
what
he
did
not
all
of
which
merely
goes
to
prove
that
david
was
still
on
the
lookout
for
that
great
work
which
his
father
had
said
was
waiting
for
him
out
in
the
world
meanwhile
david
played
his
violin
if
he
found
a
crimson
rambler
in
bloom
in
a
he
put
it
into
a
little
melody
of
pure
delight
that
a
woman
in
the
house
behind
the
rambler
heard
the
music
and
was
cheered
at
her
task
david
did
not
know
if
he
found
a
kitten
at
play
in
the
sunshine
he
put
it
into
a
riotous
abandonment
of
tumbling
turns
and
trills
that
a
fretful
baby
heard
and
stopped
its
wailing
david
also
did
not
know
and
once
just
because
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
air
was
sweet
and
it
was
so
good
to
be
alive
david
lifted
his
bow
and
put
it
all
into
a
rapturous
paean
of
ringing
exultation
that
a
sick
man
in
a
darkened
chamber
above
the
street
lifted
his
head
drew
in
his
breath
and
took
suddenly
a
new
lease
of
life
david
still
again
did
not
know
all
of
which
merely
goes
to
prove
that
david
had
perhaps
found
his
work
and
was
doing
it
although
yet
still
again
david
did
not
know
it
was
in
the
cemetery
one
afternoon
that
david
came
upon
the
lady
in
black
she
was
on
her
knees
putting
flowers
on
a
little
mound
before
her
she
looked
up
as
david
approached
for
a
moment
she
gazed
wistfully
at
him
then
as
if
impelled
by
a
hidden
force
she
spoke
little
boy
who
are
you
i
david
david
david
who
do
you
live
here
i
seen
you
here
before
oh
yes
i
been
here
quite
a
lot
of
times
purposely
the
boy
evaded
the
questions
david
was
getting
tired
of
questions
especially
these
questions
and
have
you
lost
one
dear
to
you
little
boy
lost
some
one
i
mean
is
your
father
or
mother
here
here
oh
no
they
are
here
my
mother
is
an
and
my
father
has
gone
to
the
far
country
he
is
waiting
for
me
there
you
know
but
that
the
same
that
is
she
stopped
helplessly
bewildered
eyes
on
david
serene
face
then
suddenly
a
great
light
came
to
her
own
oh
little
boy
i
wish
i
could
understand
that
just
that
she
breathed
it
would
make
it
so
much
easier
if
i
could
just
remember
that
they
are
here
that
they
waiting
over
there
but
david
apparently
did
not
hear
he
had
turned
and
was
playing
softly
as
he
walked
away
silently
the
lady
in
black
knelt
listening
looking
after
him
when
she
rose
some
time
later
and
left
the
cemetery
the
light
on
her
face
was
still
there
deeper
more
glorified
toward
boys
and
girls
especially
boys
of
his
own
age
david
frequently
turned
wistful
eyes
david
wanted
a
friend
a
friend
who
would
know
and
understand
a
friend
who
would
see
things
as
he
saw
them
who
would
understand
what
he
was
saying
when
he
played
it
seemed
to
david
that
in
some
boy
of
his
own
age
he
ought
to
find
such
a
friend
he
had
seen
many
boys
but
he
had
not
yet
found
the
friend
david
had
begun
to
think
indeed
that
of
all
these
strange
beings
in
this
new
life
of
his
boys
were
the
strangest
they
stared
and
nudged
each
other
unpleasantly
when
they
came
upon
him
playing
they
jeered
when
he
tried
to
tell
them
what
he
had
been
playing
they
had
never
heard
of
the
great
orchestra
of
life
and
they
fell
into
most
disconcerting
fits
of
laughter
or
else
backed
away
as
if
afraid
when
he
told
them
that
they
themselves
were
instruments
in
it
and
that
if
they
did
not
keep
themselves
in
tune
there
was
sure
to
be
a
discord
somewhere
then
there
were
their
games
and
frolics
such
as
were
played
with
balls
bats
and
bags
of
beans
david
thought
he
would
like
very
much
but
the
boys
only
scoffed
when
he
asked
them
to
teach
him
how
to
play
they
laughed
when
a
dog
chased
a
cat
and
they
thought
it
very
very
funny
when
tony
the
old
black
man
tripped
on
the
string
they
drew
across
his
path
they
liked
to
throw
stones
and
shoot
guns
and
the
more
creeping
crawling
or
flying
creatures
that
they
could
send
to
the
far
country
the
happier
they
were
apparently
nor
did
they
like
it
at
all
when
he
asked
them
if
they
were
sure
all
these
creeping
crawling
flying
creatures
wanted
to
leave
this
beautiful
world
and
to
be
made
dead
they
sneered
and
called
him
a
sissy
david
did
not
know
what
a
sissy
was
but
from
the
way
they
said
it
he
judged
it
must
be
even
worse
to
be
a
sissy
than
to
be
a
thief
and
then
he
discovered
joe
david
had
found
himself
in
a
very
strange
very
unlovely
neighborhood
that
afternoon
the
street
was
full
of
papers
and
tin
cans
the
houses
were
unspeakably
forlorn
with
sagging
blinds
and
lack
of
paint
untidy
women
and
men
leaned
over
the
dilapidated
fences
or
lolled
on
doorsteps
david
his
shrinking
eyes
turning
from
one
side
to
the
other
passed
slowly
through
the
street
his
violin
under
his
arm
nowhere
could
david
find
here
the
tiniest
spot
of
beauty
to
play
he
had
reached
quite
the
most
forlorn
little
shanty
on
the
street
when
the
promise
in
his
father
letter
occurred
to
him
with
a
suddenly
illumined
face
he
raised
his
violin
to
position
and
plunged
into
a
veritable
whirl
of
trills
and
runs
and
tripping
melodies
if
i
did
just
entirely
forget
that
i
did
need
to
see
anything
beautiful
to
play
laughed
david
softly
to
himself
why
it
already
right
here
in
my
violin
david
had
passed
the
shanty
and
was
hesitating
where
two
streets
crossed
when
he
felt
a
light
touch
on
his
arm
he
turned
to
confront
a
small
girl
in
a
patched
and
faded
calico
dress
obviously
outgrown
her
eyes
were
wide
and
frightened
in
the
middle
of
her
outstretched
dirty
little
palm
was
a
copper
cent
if
you
please
joe
sent
this
to
you
she
faltered
to
me
what
for
david
stopped
playing
and
lowered
his
violin
the
little
girl
backed
away
perceptibly
though
she
still
held
out
the
coin
he
wanted
you
to
stay
and
play
some
more
he
said
to
tell
you
he
sent
more
money
if
he
could
but
he
did
have
it
he
just
had
this
cent
david
eyes
flew
wide
open
you
mean
he
wants
me
to
play
he
likes
it
he
asked
joyfully
yes
he
said
he
knew
much
the
cent
but
he
thought
maybe
you
play
a
little
for
it
play
of
course
i
play
cried
david
oh
no
i
do
want
the
money
he
added
waving
the
coin
aside
i
do
need
money
where
i
living
now
where
is
he
the
one
that
wanted
me
to
play
he
finished
eagerly
in
there
by
the
window
it
joe
he
my
brother
the
little
girl
in
spite
of
her
evident
satisfaction
at
the
accomplishment
of
her
purpose
yet
kept
quite
aloof
from
the
boy
nor
did
the
fact
that
he
refused
the
money
appear
to
bring
her
anything
but
uneasy
surprise
in
the
window
david
saw
a
boy
apparently
about
his
own
age
a
boy
with
sandy
hair
pale
cheeks
and
curiously
intent
blue
eyes
is
he
coming
did
you
get
him
will
he
play
called
the
boy
at
the
window
eagerly
yes
i
right
here
i
the
one
ca
you
see
the
violin
shall
i
play
here
or
come
in
answered
david
not
one
whit
less
eagerly
the
small
girl
opened
her
lips
as
if
to
explain
something
but
the
boy
in
the
window
did
not
wait
oh
come
in
will
you
come
in
he
cried
unbelievingly
and
will
you
just
let
me
touch
it
the
fiddle
come
you
will
come
see
there
anybody
home
only
just
betty
and
me
of
course
i
will
david
fairly
stumbled
up
the
broken
steps
in
his
impatience
to
reach
the
door
did
you
like
it
what
i
played
and
did
you
know
what
i
was
playing
did
you
understand
could
you
see
the
up
in
the
sky
and
my
silver
lake
down
in
the
valley
and
could
you
hear
the
birds
and
the
winds
in
the
trees
and
the
little
brooks
could
you
oh
did
you
understand
i
so
wanted
to
find
some
one
that
could
but
i
would
think
that
you
here
with
a
gesture
and
an
expression
on
his
face
that
were
unmistakable
david
came
to
a
helpless
pause
there
joe
what
i
tell
you
cried
the
little
girl
in
a
husky
whisper
darting
to
her
brother
side
oh
why
did
you
make
me
get
him
here
everybody
says
he
crazy
as
a
loon
and
but
the
boy
reached
out
a
quickly
silencing
hand
his
face
was
curiously
alight
as
if
from
an
inward
glow
his
eyes
still
widely
intent
were
staring
straight
ahead
stop
betty
wait
he
hushed
her
maybe
i
think
i
do
understand
boy
you
mean
inside
of
you
you
see
those
things
and
then
you
try
to
make
your
fiddle
tell
what
you
are
seeing
is
that
it
yes
yes
cried
david
oh
you
do
understand
and
i
never
thought
you
could
i
never
thought
that
anybody
could
that
did
have
anything
to
look
at
but
him
but
these
things
but
these
to
look
at
echoed
the
boy
with
a
sudden
anguish
in
his
voice
anything
but
these
i
guess
if
i
could
see
anything
i
would
mind
what
i
see
an
you
would
neither
if
you
was
blind
like
me
blind
david
fell
back
face
and
voice
were
full
of
horror
you
mean
you
ca
see
anything
with
your
eyes
nothin
oh
i
never
saw
any
one
blind
before
there
was
one
in
a
book
but
father
took
it
away
since
then
in
books
down
here
i
found
others
but
yes
yes
well
never
mind
that
cut
in
the
blind
boy
growing
restive
under
the
pity
in
the
other
voice
play
wo
you
but
how
are
you
ever
going
to
know
what
a
beautiful
world
it
is
shuddered
david
how
can
you
know
and
how
can
you
ever
play
in
tune
you
one
of
the
instruments
father
said
everybody
was
and
he
said
everybody
was
playing
something
all
the
time
and
if
you
did
play
in
tune
joe
joe
please
begged
the
little
girl
wo
you
let
him
go
afraid
i
told
you
shucks
betty
he
wo
hurt
ye
laughed
joe
a
little
irritably
then
to
david
he
turned
again
with
some
sharpness
play
wo
ye
you
said
you
play
yes
oh
yes
i
play
faltered
david
bringing
his
violin
hastily
to
position
and
testing
the
strings
with
fingers
that
shook
a
little
there
breathed
joe
settling
back
in
his
chair
with
a
contented
sigh
now
play
it
again
what
you
did
before
but
david
did
not
play
what
he
did
before
at
first
there
were
no
airy
no
sky
no
birds
or
murmuring
forest
brooks
in
his
music
this
time
there
were
only
the
room
the
dirty
street
the
boy
alone
at
the
window
with
his
sightless
eyes
the
boy
who
never
never
would
know
what
a
beautiful
world
he
lived
in
then
suddenly
to
david
came
a
new
thought
this
boy
joe
had
said
before
that
he
understood
he
had
seemed
to
know
that
he
was
being
told
of
the
sunny
skies
and
the
forest
winds
the
singing
birds
and
the
babbling
brooks
perhaps
again
now
he
would
understand
what
if
for
those
sightless
eyes
one
could
create
a
world
possibly
never
before
had
david
played
as
he
played
then
it
was
as
if
upon
those
four
quivering
strings
he
was
laying
the
purple
and
gold
of
a
thousand
sunsets
the
rose
and
amber
of
a
thousand
sunrises
the
green
of
a
boundless
earth
the
blue
of
a
sky
that
reached
to
heaven
itself
to
make
joe
understand
gee
breathed
joe
when
the
music
came
to
an
end
with
a
crashing
chord
say
that
just
great
wo
you
let
me
please
just
touch
that
fiddle
and
david
looking
into
the
blind
boy
exalted
face
knew
that
joe
had
indeed
understood
chapter
x
the
lady
of
the
roses
it
was
a
new
world
indeed
that
david
created
for
joe
after
that
a
world
that
had
to
do
with
entrancing
music
where
once
was
silence
delightful
companionship
where
once
was
loneliness
and
toothsome
cookies
and
doughnuts
where
once
was
hunger
the
widow
glaspell
joe
mother
worked
out
by
the
day
scrubbing
and
washing
and
joe
perforce
was
left
to
the
somewhat
erratic
and
decidedly
unskillful
ministrations
of
betty
betty
was
no
worse
and
no
better
than
any
other
untaught
irresponsible
girl
and
it
was
not
to
be
expected
perhaps
that
she
would
care
to
spend
all
the
bright
sunny
hours
shut
up
with
her
sorely
afflicted
and
somewhat
fretful
brother
true
at
noon
she
never
failed
to
appear
and
prepare
something
that
passed
for
a
dinner
for
herself
and
joe
but
the
glaspell
larder
was
frequently
almost
as
empty
as
were
the
hungry
stomachs
that
looked
to
it
for
refreshment
and
it
would
have
taken
a
far
more
skillful
cook
than
was
the
betty
to
evolve
anything
from
it
that
was
either
palatable
or
satisfying
with
the
coming
of
david
into
joe
life
all
this
was
changed
first
there
were
the
music
and
the
companionship
joe
father
had
played
in
the
band
in
his
youth
and
according
to
the
widow
glaspell
had
been
a
powerful
hand
for
music
it
was
from
him
presumably
that
joe
had
inherited
his
passion
for
melody
and
harmony
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
david
recognized
so
soon
in
the
blind
boy
the
spirit
that
made
them
kin
at
the
first
stroke
of
david
bow
indeed
the
dingy
walls
about
them
would
crumble
into
nothingness
and
together
the
two
boys
were
off
in
a
fairy
world
of
loveliness
and
joy
nor
was
listening
always
joe
part
from
just
touching
the
violin
his
first
longing
plea
he
came
to
drawing
a
timid
bow
across
the
strings
in
an
incredibly
short
time
then
he
was
picking
out
bits
of
melody
and
by
the
end
of
a
fortnight
david
had
brought
his
violin
for
joe
to
practice
on
i
ca
give
it
to
you
not
for
keeps
david
had
explained
a
bit
tremulously
because
it
was
daddy
you
know
and
when
i
see
it
it
seems
almost
as
if
i
was
seeing
him
but
you
may
take
it
then
you
can
have
it
here
to
play
on
whenever
you
like
after
that
in
joe
own
hands
lay
the
power
to
transport
himself
into
another
world
for
with
the
violin
for
company
he
knew
no
loneliness
nor
was
the
violin
all
that
david
brought
to
the
house
there
were
the
doughnuts
and
the
cookies
very
early
in
his
visits
david
had
discovered
much
to
his
surprise
that
joe
and
betty
were
often
hungry
but
why
do
you
go
down
to
the
store
and
buy
something
he
had
queried
at
once
upon
being
told
that
there
was
no
money
to
buy
with
david
first
impulse
had
been
to
bring
several
of
the
the
next
time
he
came
but
upon
second
thoughts
david
decided
that
he
did
not
dare
he
was
not
wishing
to
be
called
a
thief
a
second
time
it
would
be
better
he
concluded
to
bring
some
food
from
the
house
instead
in
his
mountain
home
everything
the
house
afforded
in
the
way
of
food
had
always
been
freely
given
to
the
few
strangers
that
found
their
way
to
the
cabin
door
so
now
david
had
no
hesitation
in
going
to
holly
pantry
for
supplies
upon
the
occasion
of
his
next
visit
to
joe
glaspell
holly
coming
into
the
kitchen
found
him
merging
from
the
pantry
with
both
hands
full
of
cookies
and
doughnuts
why
david
what
in
the
world
does
this
mean
she
demanded
they
for
joe
and
betty
smiled
david
happily
for
joe
and
but
those
doughnuts
and
cookies
do
belong
to
you
they
mine
yes
i
know
they
are
i
told
them
you
had
plenty
nodded
david
plenty
what
if
i
have
remonstrated
holly
in
growing
indignation
that
does
mean
that
you
can
take
something
in
david
face
stopped
the
words
you
do
mean
that
i
ca
take
them
to
joe
and
betty
do
you
why
holly
they
hungry
joe
and
betty
are
they
do
have
half
enough
to
eat
betty
said
so
and
we
got
more
than
we
want
food
left
on
the
table
every
day
why
if
you
were
hungry
would
you
want
somebody
to
bring
but
holly
stopped
him
with
a
despairing
gesture
there
there
never
mind
run
along
of
course
you
can
take
them
i
i
glad
to
have
you
she
finished
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
drive
from
david
face
that
look
of
shocked
incredulity
with
which
he
was
still
regarding
her
never
again
did
holly
attempt
to
thwart
david
generosity
to
the
glaspells
but
she
did
try
to
regulate
it
she
saw
to
it
that
thereafter
upon
his
visits
to
the
house
he
took
only
certain
things
and
a
certain
amount
and
invariably
things
of
her
own
choosing
but
not
always
toward
the
glaspell
shanty
did
david
turn
his
steps
very
frequently
it
was
in
quite
another
direction
he
had
been
at
the
holly
farmhouse
three
weeks
when
he
found
his
lady
of
the
roses
he
had
passed
quite
through
the
village
that
day
and
had
come
to
a
road
that
was
new
to
him
it
was
a
beautiful
road
smooth
white
and
firm
two
huge
granite
posts
topped
with
flaming
nasturtiums
marked
the
point
where
it
turned
off
from
the
main
highway
beyond
these
as
david
soon
found
it
ran
between
lawns
and
flowering
shrubs
leading
up
the
gentle
slope
of
a
hill
where
it
led
to
david
did
not
know
but
he
proceeded
unhesitatingly
to
try
to
find
out
for
some
time
he
climbed
the
slope
in
silence
his
violin
mute
under
his
arm
but
the
white
road
still
lay
in
tantalizing
mystery
before
him
when
a
offered
the
greater
temptation
and
lured
him
to
explore
its
cool
shadowy
depths
instead
had
david
but
known
it
he
was
at
hinsdale
one
show
place
the
country
home
of
its
one
really
rich
resident
miss
barbara
holbrook
had
he
also
but
known
it
miss
holbrook
was
not
celebrated
for
her
graciousness
to
any
visitors
certainly
not
to
those
who
ventured
to
approach
her
otherwise
than
by
a
conventional
ring
at
her
front
doorbell
but
david
did
not
know
all
this
and
he
therefore
very
happily
followed
the
shady
path
until
he
came
to
the
wonder
at
the
end
of
it
the
wonder
in
hinsdale
parlance
was
only
miss
holbrook
garden
but
in
david
eyes
it
was
fairyland
come
true
for
one
whole
minute
he
could
only
stand
like
a
very
ordinary
little
boy
and
stare
at
the
end
of
the
minute
he
became
himself
once
more
and
being
himself
he
expressed
his
delight
at
once
in
the
only
way
he
knew
how
to
do
by
raising
his
violin
and
beginning
to
play
he
had
meant
to
tell
of
the
limpid
pool
and
of
the
arch
of
the
bridge
it
reflected
of
the
terraced
lawns
and
marble
steps
and
of
the
gleaming
white
of
the
sculptured
nymphs
and
fauns
of
the
splashes
of
glorious
crimson
yellow
and
snowy
white
against
the
green
where
the
roses
rioted
in
luxurious
bloom
he
had
meant
also
to
tell
of
the
queen
rose
of
them
all
the
beauteous
lady
with
hair
like
the
gold
of
sunrise
and
a
gown
like
the
shimmer
of
the
moon
on
water
of
all
this
he
had
meant
to
tell
but
he
had
scarcely
begun
to
tell
it
at
all
when
the
beauteous
lady
of
the
roses
sprang
to
her
feet
and
became
so
very
much
like
an
angry
young
woman
who
is
seriously
displeased
that
david
could
only
lower
his
violin
in
dismay
why
boy
what
does
this
mean
she
demanded
david
sighed
a
little
impatiently
as
he
came
forward
into
the
sunlight
but
i
was
just
telling
you
he
remonstrated
and
you
would
not
let
me
finish
telling
me
yes
with
my
violin
could
you
understand
appealed
the
boy
wistfully
you
looked
as
if
you
could
looked
as
if
i
could
yes
joe
understood
you
see
and
i
was
surprised
when
he
did
but
i
was
just
sure
you
could
with
all
this
to
look
at
the
lady
frowned
she
glanced
about
her
as
if
contemplating
flight
then
she
turned
back
to
the
boy
but
how
came
you
here
who
are
you
she
cried
i
david
i
walked
here
through
the
little
path
back
there
i
know
where
it
went
to
but
i
so
glad
now
i
found
out
oh
are
you
murmured
the
lady
with
slightly
uplifted
brows
she
was
about
to
tell
him
very
coldly
that
now
that
he
had
found
his
way
there
he
might
occupy
himself
in
finding
it
home
again
when
the
boy
interposed
rapturously
his
eyes
sweeping
the
scene
before
him
yes
i
did
suppose
anywhere
down
here
there
was
a
place
one
half
so
beautiful
an
odd
feeling
of
uncanniness
sent
a
swift
exclamation
to
the
lips
here
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
speak
as
if
you
came
from
above
she
almost
laughed
i
did
returned
david
simply
but
even
up
there
i
never
found
anything
quite
like
this
with
a
sweep
of
his
hands
nor
like
you
o
lady
of
the
roses
he
finished
with
an
admiration
that
was
as
open
as
it
was
ardent
this
time
the
lady
laughed
outright
she
even
blushed
a
little
very
prettily
put
sir
flatterer
she
retorted
but
when
you
are
older
young
man
you
wo
make
your
compliments
quite
so
broad
i
am
no
lady
of
the
roses
i
am
miss
holbrook
and
and
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
receiving
gentlemen
callers
who
are
uninvited
and
unannounced
she
concluded
a
little
sharply
pointless
the
shaft
fell
at
david
feet
he
had
turned
again
to
the
beauties
about
him
and
at
that
moment
he
spied
the
sundial
something
he
had
never
seen
before
what
is
it
he
cried
eagerly
hurrying
forward
it
is
exactly
pretty
and
yet
it
looks
as
if
were
meant
for
something
it
is
it
is
a
sundial
it
marks
the
time
by
the
sun
even
as
she
spoke
miss
holbrook
wondered
why
she
answered
the
question
at
all
why
she
did
not
send
this
small
piece
of
nonchalant
impertinence
about
his
business
as
he
so
richly
deserved
the
next
instant
she
found
herself
staring
at
the
boy
in
amazement
with
unmistakable
ease
and
with
the
trained
accent
of
the
scholar
he
was
reading
aloud
the
latin
inscription
on
the
dial
non
numero
nisi
serenas
count
no
hours
but
unclouded
ones
he
translated
then
slowly
though
with
confidence
that
pretty
but
what
does
it
mean
about
miss
holbrook
rose
to
her
feet
for
heaven
sake
boy
who
and
what
are
you
she
demanded
can
you
read
latin
why
of
course
ca
you
with
a
disdainful
gesture
miss
holbrook
swept
this
aside
boy
who
are
you
she
demanded
again
imperatively
i
david
i
told
you
but
david
who
where
do
you
live
the
boy
face
clouded
i
david
just
david
i
live
at
farmer
holly
now
but
i
did
live
on
the
mountain
with
father
you
know
a
great
light
of
understanding
broke
over
miss
holbrook
face
she
dropped
back
into
her
seat
oh
i
remember
she
murmured
you
the
little
er
boy
whom
he
took
i
have
heard
the
story
so
that
is
who
you
are
she
added
the
old
look
of
aversion
coming
back
to
her
eyes
she
had
almost
said
the
little
tramp
boy
but
she
had
stopped
in
time
yes
and
now
what
do
they
mean
please
those
words
count
no
hours
but
unclouded
ones
miss
holbrook
stirred
in
her
seat
and
frowned
why
it
means
what
it
says
of
course
boy
a
sundial
counts
its
hours
by
the
shadow
the
sun
throws
and
when
there
is
no
sun
there
is
no
shadow
hence
it
only
the
sunny
hours
that
are
counted
by
the
dial
she
explained
a
little
fretfully
david
face
radiated
delight
oh
but
i
like
that
he
exclaimed
you
like
it
yes
i
should
like
to
be
one
myself
you
know
well
really
and
how
pray
in
spite
of
herself
a
faint
gleam
of
interest
came
into
miss
holbrook
eyes
david
laughed
and
dropped
himself
easily
to
the
ground
at
her
feet
he
was
holding
his
violin
on
his
knees
now
why
it
would
be
such
fun
he
chuckled
to
just
forget
all
about
the
hours
when
the
sun
did
shine
and
remember
only
the
nice
pleasant
ones
now
for
me
there
would
be
any
hours
really
until
after
four
except
little
specks
of
minutes
that
i
get
in
between
when
i
did
see
something
interesting
miss
holbrook
stared
frankly
what
an
extraordinary
boy
you
are
to
be
sure
she
murmured
and
what
may
i
ask
is
it
that
you
do
every
day
until
four
that
you
wish
to
forget
david
sighed
well
there
are
lots
of
things
i
hoed
potatoes
and
corn
first
but
they
too
big
now
mostly
and
i
pulled
up
weeds
too
till
they
were
gone
i
been
picking
up
stones
lately
and
clearing
up
the
yard
then
of
course
there
always
the
woodbox
to
fill
and
the
eggs
to
hunt
besides
the
chickens
to
feed
though
i
do
mind
them
so
much
but
i
do
the
other
things
the
weeds
they
were
so
much
prettier
than
the
things
i
had
to
let
grow
always
miss
holbrook
laughed
well
they
were
and
really
persisted
the
boy
in
answer
to
the
merriment
in
her
eyes
now
would
it
be
nice
to
be
like
the
sundial
and
forget
everything
the
sun
did
shine
on
would
you
like
it
is
there
anything
you
want
to
forget
miss
holbrook
sobered
instantly
the
change
in
her
face
was
so
very
marked
indeed
that
involuntarily
david
looked
about
for
something
that
might
have
cast
upon
it
so
great
a
shadow
for
a
long
minute
she
did
not
speak
then
very
slowly
very
bitterly
she
said
aloud
yet
as
if
to
herself
yes
if
i
had
my
way
i
forget
them
every
one
these
hours
every
single
one
oh
lady
of
the
roses
expostulated
david
in
a
voice
quivering
with
shocked
dismay
you
do
mean
you
ca
mean
that
you
do
have
any
sun
i
mean
just
that
bowed
miss
holbrook
wearily
her
eyes
on
the
somber
shadows
of
the
pool
just
that
david
sat
stunned
confounded
across
the
marble
steps
and
the
terraces
the
shadows
lengthened
and
david
watched
them
as
the
sun
dipped
behind
the
they
seemed
to
make
more
vivid
the
chill
and
the
gloom
of
the
lady
words
more
real
the
day
that
had
no
sun
after
a
time
the
boy
picked
up
his
violin
and
began
to
play
softly
and
at
first
with
evident
hesitation
even
when
his
touch
became
more
confident
there
was
still
in
the
music
a
questioning
appeal
that
seemed
to
find
no
answer
an
appeal
that
even
the
player
himself
could
not
have
explained
for
long
minutes
the
young
woman
and
the
boy
sat
thus
in
the
twilight
then
suddenly
the
woman
got
to
her
feet
come
come
boy
what
can
i
be
thinking
of
she
cried
sharply
i
must
go
in
and
you
must
go
home
and
she
swept
across
the
grass
to
the
path
that
led
toward
the
house
chapter
xi
jack
and
jill
david
was
tempted
to
go
for
a
second
visit
to
his
lady
of
the
roses
but
something
he
could
not
define
held
him
back
the
lady
was
in
his
mind
almost
constantly
however
and
very
vivid
to
him
was
the
picture
of
the
garden
though
always
it
was
as
he
had
seen
it
last
with
the
hush
and
shadow
of
twilight
and
with
the
lady
face
gloomily
turned
toward
the
sunless
pool
david
could
not
forget
that
for
her
there
were
no
hours
to
count
she
had
said
it
herself
he
could
not
understand
how
this
could
be
so
and
the
thought
filled
him
with
vague
unrest
and
pain
perhaps
it
was
this
restlessness
that
drove
david
to
explore
even
more
persistently
the
village
itself
sending
him
into
new
streets
in
search
of
something
strange
and
interesting
one
day
the
sound
of
shouts
and
laughter
drew
him
to
an
open
lot
back
of
the
church
where
some
boys
were
at
play
david
still
knew
very
little
of
boys
in
his
mountain
home
he
had
never
had
them
for
playmates
and
he
had
not
seen
much
of
them
when
he
went
with
his
father
to
the
mountain
village
for
supplies
there
had
been
it
is
true
the
boy
who
frequently
brought
milk
and
eggs
to
the
cabin
but
he
had
been
very
quiet
and
shy
appearing
always
afraid
and
anxious
to
get
away
as
if
he
had
been
told
not
to
stay
more
recently
since
david
had
been
at
the
holly
farmhouse
his
experience
with
boys
had
been
even
less
satisfying
the
boys
with
the
exception
of
blind
joe
had
very
clearly
let
it
be
understood
that
they
had
little
use
for
a
youth
who
could
find
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
tramp
through
the
woods
and
the
streets
with
a
fiddle
under
his
arm
however
there
came
a
change
perhaps
they
were
more
used
to
him
or
perhaps
they
had
decided
suddenly
that
it
might
be
good
fun
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
anyway
regardless
of
consequences
whatever
it
was
the
lads
hailed
his
appearance
with
wild
shouts
of
glee
golly
boys
look
here
the
fiddlin
kid
yelled
one
and
the
others
joined
in
the
hurrah
he
gave
david
smiled
delightedly
once
more
he
had
found
some
one
who
wanted
him
and
it
was
so
nice
to
be
wanted
truth
to
tell
david
had
felt
not
a
little
hurt
at
the
persistent
avoidance
of
all
those
boys
and
girls
of
his
own
age
how
how
do
you
do
he
said
diffidently
but
still
with
that
beaming
smile
again
the
boys
shouted
gleefully
as
they
hurried
forward
several
had
short
sticks
in
their
hands
one
had
an
old
tomato
can
with
a
string
tied
to
it
the
tallest
boy
had
something
that
he
was
trying
to
hold
beneath
his
coat
how
do
you
do
they
mimicked
how

the
reminder

graciously
given
with
a
smile
david

name

chanted
the
boys
as
if
they
were
a
chorus
david
laughed
outright
oh
sing
it
again
sing
it
again
he
crowed
that
sounded
fine
the
boys
stared
then
sniffed
disdainfully
and
cast
derisive
glances
into
each
other
eyes
it
appeared
that
this
little
sissy
tramp
boy
did
not
even
know
enough
to
discover
when
he
was
being
laughed
at
david
david
his
name
is
david
they
jeered
into
his
face
again

tune

cried
david
joyously
raising
his
violin
and
testing
a
string
for
its
tone
here
hold
on
yelled
the
tallest
boy
the
queen
o
the
ballet
ready
and
he
cautiously
pulled
from
beneath
his
coat
a
struggling
kitten
with
a
perforated
bag
tied
over
its
head
sure
we
want
her
in
the
middle
grinned
the
boy
with
the
tin
can
hold
on
till
i
get
her
train
tied
to
her
he
finished
trying
to
capture
the
swishing
fluffy
tail
of
the
frightened
little
cat
david
had
begun
to
play
but
he
stopped
his
music
with
a
discordant
stroke
of
the
bow
what
are
you
doing
what
is
the
matter
with
that
cat
he
demanded
called
a
derisive
voice
sure
nothin
the
matter
with
her
she
the
queen
o
the
ballet
she
is
what
do
you
mean
cried
david
at
that
moment
the
string
bit
hard
into
the
captured
tail
and
the
kitten
cried
out
with
the
pain
look
out
you
hurting
her
cautioned
david
sharply
only
a
laugh
and
a
jeering
word
answered
then
the
kitten
with
the
bag
on
its
head
and
the
tin
can
tied
to
its
tail
was
let
warily
to
the
ground
the
tall
boy
still
holding
its
back
with
both
hands
ready
now
come
on
play
he
ordered
then
we
set
her
dancing
david
eyes
flashed
i
will
not
play
for
that
the
boys
stopped
laughing
suddenly
eh
what
they
could
scarcely
have
been
more
surprised
if
the
kitten
itself
had
said
the
words
i
say
i
wo
play
i
ca
play
unless
you
let
that
cat
go
wo
ye
hear
that
now
laughed
a
mocking
voice
and
what
if
we
say
we
wo
let
her
go
eh
then
i
make
you
vowed
david
aflame
with
a
newborn
something
that
seemed
to
have
sprung
into
being
yow
hooted
the
tallest
boy
removing
both
hands
from
the
captive
kitten
the
kitten
released
began
to
back
frantically
the
can
dangling
at
its
heels
rattled
and
banged
and
thumped
until
the
frightened
little
creature
crazed
with
terror
became
nothing
but
a
whirling
mass
of
misery
the
boys
formed
now
into
a
crowing
circle
of
delight
kept
the
kitten
within
bounds
and
flouted
david
mercilessly
ah
ha
stop
us
will
ye
why
do
ye
stop
us
they
gibed
for
a
moment
david
stood
without
movement
his
eyes
staring
the
next
instant
he
turned
and
ran
the
jeers
became
a
chorus
of
triumphant
shouts
then
but
not
for
long
david
had
only
hurried
to
the
woodpile
to
lay
down
his
violin
he
came
back
then
on
the
run
and
before
the
tallest
boy
could
catch
his
breath
he
was
felled
by
a
stinging
blow
on
the
jaw
over
by
the
church
a
small
girl
and
clambered
hastily
over
the
fence
behind
which
for
long
minutes
she
had
been
crying
and
wringing
her
hands
he
be
killed
he
be
killed
she
moaned
and
it
my
fault
it
my
kitty
it
my
kitty
she
sobbed
straining
her
eyes
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
kitten
protector
in
the
squirming
mass
of
legs
and
arms
the
kitten
unheeded
now
by
the
boys
was
pursuing
its
backward
whirl
to
destruction
some
distance
away
and
very
soon
the
little
girl
discovered
her
with
a
bound
and
a
choking
cry
she
reached
the
kitten
removed
the
bag
and
unbound
the
cruel
string
then
sitting
on
the
ground
a
safe
distance
away
she
soothed
the
palpitating
little
bunch
of
gray
fur
and
watched
with
fearful
eyes
the
fight
and
what
a
fight
it
was
there
was
no
question
of
course
as
to
its
final
outcome
with
six
against
one
but
meanwhile
the
one
was
giving
the
six
the
surprise
of
their
lives
in
the
shape
of
blows
and
skillful
twists
and
turns
that
caused
their
own
strength
and
weight
to
react
upon
themselves
in
a
most
astonishing
fashion
the
one
unmistakably
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
however
when
the
little
girl
after
a
hurried
dash
to
the
street
brought
back
with
her
to
the
rescue
a
tall
young
man
whom
she
had
hailed
from
afar
as
jack
jack
put
a
stop
to
things
at
once
with
vigorous
jerks
and
pulls
he
unsnarled
the
writhing
mass
boy
by
boy
each
one
of
whom
upon
catching
sight
of
his
face
slunk
hurriedly
away
as
if
glad
to
escape
so
lightly
there
was
left
finally
upon
the
ground
only
david
alone
but
when
david
did
at
last
appear
the
little
girl
burst
into
tears
anew
oh
jack
he
killed
i
know
he
killed
she
wailed
and
he
was
so
nice
and
and
pretty
and
now
look
at
him
ai
he
a
sight
david
was
not
killed
but
he
was
a
sight
his
blouse
was
torn
his
tie
was
gone
and
his
face
and
hands
were
covered
with
dirt
and
blood
above
one
eye
was
an
lump
and
below
the
other
was
a
red
bruise
somewhat
dazedly
he
responded
to
the
man
helpful
hand
pulled
himself
upright
and
looked
about
him
he
did
not
see
the
little
girl
behind
him
where
the
cat
he
asked
anxiously
the
unexpected
happened
then
with
a
sobbing
cry
the
little
girl
flung
herself
upon
him
cat
and
all
here
right
here
she
choked
and
it
was
you
who
saved
her
my
juliette
and
i
love
you
love
you
love
you
always
for
it
there
there
jill
interposed
the
man
a
little
hurriedly
suppose
we
first
show
our
gratitude
by
seeing
if
we
ca
do
something
to
make
our
young
warrior
here
more
comfortable
and
he
began
to
brush
off
with
his
handkerchief
some
of
the
accumulated
dirt
why
ca
we
take
him
home
jack
and
clean
him
up
other
folks
see
him
suggested
the
girl
the
boy
turned
quickly
did
you
call
him
yes
and
he
called
you
jill
yes
the
real
and
jill
that
up
the
hill
the
man
and
the
girl
laughed
but
the
girl
shook
her
head
as
she
answered
not
really
though
we
do
go
up
a
hill
all
right
every
day
but
those
are
even
our
own
names
we
just
call
each
other
that
for
fun
you
ever
call
things
for
fun
david
face
lighted
up
in
spite
of
the
dirt
the
lump
and
the
bruise
oh
do
you
do
that
he
breathed
say
i
just
know
i
like
to
play
to
you
you
understand
oh
yes
and
he
plays
too
explained
the
little
girl
turning
to
the
man
rapturously
on
a
fiddle
you
know
like
you
she
had
not
finished
her
sentence
before
david
was
away
hurrying
a
little
unsteadily
across
the
lot
for
his
violin
when
he
came
back
the
man
was
looking
at
him
with
an
anxious
frown
suppose
you
come
home
with
us
boy
he
said
it
is
far
through
the
hill
pasture
lots
and
we
look
you
over
a
bit
that
lump
over
your
eye
needs
attention
thank
you
beamed
david
i
like
to
go
and
i
glad
you
want
me
he
spoke
to
the
man
but
he
looked
at
the
little
girl
who
still
held
the
gray
kitten
in
her
arms
chapter
xii
answers
that
did
not
answer
jack
and
jill
it
appeared
were
a
brother
and
sister
who
lived
in
a
tiny
house
on
a
hill
directly
across
the
creek
from
sunnycrest
beyond
this
david
learned
little
until
after
bumps
and
bruises
and
dirt
had
been
carefully
attended
to
he
had
then
too
some
questions
to
answer
concerning
himself
and
now
if
you
please
began
the
man
smilingly
as
he
surveyed
the
boy
with
an
eye
that
could
see
no
further
service
to
be
rendered
do
you
mind
telling
me
who
you
are
and
how
you
came
to
be
the
center
of
attraction
for
the
blows
and
cuffs
of
six
boys
i
david
and
i
wanted
the
cat
returned
the
boy
simply
well
that
direct
and
to
the
point
to
say
the
least
laughed
the
man
evidently
however
you
in
the
habit
of
being
that
but
david
there
were
six
of
them
those
boys
and
some
of
them
were
larger
than
you
yes
sir
and
they
were
so
bad
and
cruel
chimed
in
the
little
girl
the
man
hesitated
then
questioned
slowly
and
may
i
ask
you
where
you
er
learned
to
fight
like
that
i
used
to
box
with
father
he
said
i
must
first
be
well
and
strong
he
taught
me
jiujitsu
too
a
little
but
i
could
make
it
work
very
well
with
so
many
i
should
say
not
adjudged
the
man
grimly
but
you
gave
them
a
surprise
or
two
i
warrant
he
added
his
eyes
on
the
cause
of
the
trouble
now
curled
in
a
little
gray
bunch
of
content
on
the
window
sill
but
i
do
know
yet
who
you
are
who
is
your
father
where
does
he
live
david
shook
his
head
as
was
always
the
case
when
his
father
was
mentioned
his
face
grew
wistful
and
his
eyes
dreamy
he
does
live
here
anywhere
murmured
the
boy
in
the
far
country
he
is
waiting
for
me
to
come
to
him
and
tell
him
of
the
beautiful
world
i
have
found
you
know
eh
what
stammered
the
man
not
knowing
whether
to
believe
his
eyes
or
his
ears
this
boy
who
fought
like
a
demon
and
talked
like
a
saint
and
who
though
battered
and
bruised
prattled
of
the
beautiful
world
he
had
found
was
most
disconcerting
why
jack
do
you
know
whispered
the
little
girl
agitatedly
he
the
boy
at
holly
that
they
took
then
still
more
softly
he
the
little
tramp
boy
his
father
died
in
the
barn
oh
said
the
man
his
face
clearing
and
his
eyes
showing
a
quick
sympathy
you
the
boy
at
the
holly
farmhouse
are
you
yes
sir
and
he
plays
the
fiddle
everywhere
volunteered
the
little
girl
with
ardent
admiration
if
you
had
been
shut
up
sick
just
now
have
heard
him
yourself
he
plays
everywhere
everywhere
he
goes
is
that
so
murmured
jack
politely
shuddering
a
little
at
what
he
fancied
would
come
from
a
violin
played
by
a
boy
like
the
one
before
him
jack
could
play
the
violin
himself
a
little
enough
to
know
it
some
and
love
it
more
well
and
what
else
do
you
do
nothing
except
to
go
for
walks
and
read
nothing
a
big
boy
like
you
and
on
simeon
holly
farm
voice
and
manner
showed
that
jack
was
not
unacquainted
with
simeon
holly
and
his
methods
and
opinions
david
laughed
gleefully
oh
of
course
really
i
do
lots
of
things
only
i
do
count
those
any
more
non
numero
nisi
serenas
you
knew
he
quoted
pleasantly
smiling
into
the
man
astonished
eyes
jack
what
was
that
what
he
said
whispered
the
little
girl
it
sounded
foreign
is
he
foreign
you
got
me
jill
retorted
the
man
with
a
laughing
grimace
heaven
only
knows
what
he
is
i
do
what
he
said
was
latin
i
do
happen
to
know
that
still
he
turned
to
the
boy
ironically
of
course
you
know
the
translation
of
that
he
said
oh
yes
count
no
hours
but
unclouded
ones
and
i
liked
that
was
on
a
sundial
you
know
and
i
going
to
be
a
sundial
and
not
count
the
hours
i
do
like
while
i
pulling
up
weeds
and
hoeing
potatoes
and
picking
up
stones
and
all
that
do
you
see
for
a
moment
the
man
stared
dumbly
then
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
well
by
george
he
muttered
by
george
and
he
laughed
again
then
and
did
your
father
teach
you
that
too
he
asked
oh
no
well
he
taught
me
latin
and
so
of
course
i
could
read
it
when
i
found
it
but
those
words
i
got
off
the
sundial
where
my
lady
of
the
roses
lives
your
lady
of
the
roses
and
who
is
she
why
do
you
know
you
live
right
in
sight
of
her
house
cried
david
pointing
to
the
towers
of
sunnycrest
that
showed
above
the
trees
it
over
there
she
lives
i
know
those
towers
now
and
i
look
for
them
wherever
i
go
i
love
them
it
makes
me
see
all
over
again
the
roses
and
her
you
mean
miss
holbrook
the
voice
was
so
different
from
the
genial
tones
that
he
had
heard
before
that
david
looked
up
in
surprise
yes
she
said
that
was
her
name
he
answered
wondering
at
the
indefinable
change
that
had
come
to
the
man
face
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
the
man
rose
to
his
feet
how
your
head
does
it
ache
he
asked
briskly
not
much
some
i
i
think
i
be
going
replied
david
a
little
awkwardly
reaching
for
his
violin
and
unconsciously
showing
by
his
manner
the
sudden
chill
in
the
atmosphere
the
little
girl
spoke
then
she
overwhelmed
him
again
with
thanks
and
pointed
to
the
contented
kitten
on
the
window
sill
true
she
did
not
tell
him
this
time
that
she
would
love
love
love
him
always
but
she
beamed
upon
him
gratefully
and
she
urged
him
to
come
soon
again
and
often
david
bowed
himself
off
with
many
a
backward
wave
of
the
hand
and
many
a
promise
to
come
again
not
until
he
had
quite
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
did
he
remember
that
the
man
jack
had
said
almost
nothing
at
the
last
as
david
recollected
him
indeed
he
had
last
been
seen
standing
beside
one
of
the
veranda
posts
with
gloomy
eyes
fixed
on
the
towers
of
sunnycrest
that
showed
above
the
in
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
it
was
a
bad
that
david
spent
at
the
holly
farmhouse
in
explanation
of
his
torn
blouse
and
bruised
face
farmer
holly
did
not
approve
of
fights
and
he
said
so
very
sternly
indeed
even
holly
who
was
usually
so
kind
to
him
let
david
understand
that
he
was
in
deep
disgrace
though
she
was
very
tender
to
his
wounds
david
did
venture
to
ask
her
however
before
he
went
upstairs
to
bed
holly
who
are
those
people
jack
and
jill
that
were
so
good
to
me
this
afternoon
they
are
john
gurnsey
and
his
sister
julia
but
the
whole
town
knows
them
by
the
names
they
long
ago
gave
themselves
and
and
do
they
live
all
alone
in
the
little
house
yes
except
for
the
widow
glaspell
who
comes
in
several
times
a
week
i
believe
to
cook
and
wash
and
sweep
they
are
very
happy
afraid
david
and
i
glad
you
could
rescue
the
little
girl
kitten
for
her
but
you
must
fight
no
good
can
come
of
fighting
i
got
the
cat
by
fighting
yes
yes
i
know
but
she
did
not
finish
her
sentence
and
david
was
only
waiting
for
a
pause
to
ask
another
question
why
are
they
happy
mrs
holly
tut
tut
david
it
a
long
story
and
you
would
understand
it
if
i
told
it
it
only
that
they
all
alone
in
the
world
and
jack
gurnsey
is
well
he
must
be
thirty
years
old
now
he
had
bright
hopes
not
so
long
ago
studying
law
or
something
of
the
sort
in
the
city
then
his
father
died
and
his
mother
and
he
lost
his
health
something
ails
his
lungs
and
the
doctors
sent
him
here
to
be
out
of
doors
he
even
sleeps
out
of
doors
they
say
anyway
he
here
and
he
making
a
home
for
his
sister
but
of
course
with
his
hopes
and
ambitions
but
there
david
you
do
understand
of
course
oh
yes
i
do
breathed
david
his
eyes
pensively
turned
toward
a
shadowy
corner
he
found
his
work
out
in
the
world
and
then
he
had
to
stop
and
could
do
it
poor
mr

chapter
xiii
a
surprise
for
jack
life
at
the
holly
farmhouse
was
not
what
it
had
been
the
coming
of
david
had
introduced
new
elements
that
promised
complications
not
because
he
was
another
mouth
to
feed
simeon
holly
was
not
worrying
about
that
part
any
longer
crops
showed
good
promise
and
all
ready
in
the
bank
even
now
was
the
necessary
money
to
cover
the
dreaded
note
due
the
last
of
august
the
complicating
elements
in
regard
to
david
were
of
quite
another
nature
to
simeon
holly
the
boy
was
a
riddle
to
be
sternly
solved
to
ellen
holly
he
was
an
everpresent
reminder
of
the
little
boy
of
long
ago
and
as
such
was
to
be
loved
and
trained
into
a
semblance
of
what
that
boy
might
have
become
to
perry
larson
david
was
the
derndest
checkerboard
of
sense
an
nonsense
goin
a
game
over
which
to
chuckle
at
the
holly
farmhouse
they
could
not
understand
a
boy
who
would
leave
a
supper
for
a
sunset
or
who
preferred
a
book
to
a
toy
pistol
as
perry
larson
found
out
was
the
case
on
the
fourth
of
july
who
picked
flowers
like
a
girl
for
the
table
yet
who
unhesitatingly
struck
the
first
blow
in
a
fight
with
six
antagonists
who
would
not
go
fishing
because
the
fishes
would
not
like
it
nor
hunting
for
any
sort
of
wild
thing
that
had
life
who
hung
entranced
for
an
hour
over
the
millions
of
lovely
striped
bugs
in
a
field
of
early
potatoes
and
who
promptly
and
stubbornly
refused
to
sprinkle
those
same
lovely
bugs
with
paris
green
when
discovered
at
his
worship
all
this
was
most
perplexing
to
say
the
least
yet
david
worked
and
worked
well
and
in
most
cases
he
obeyed
orders
willingly
he
learned
much
too
that
was
interesting
and
profitable
nor
was
he
the
only
one
that
made
strange
discoveries
during
those
july
days
the
hollys
themselves
learned
much
they
learned
that
the
rose
of
sunset
and
the
gold
of
sunrise
were
worth
looking
at
and
that
the
massing
of
the
thunderheads
in
the
west
meant
more
than
just
a
shower
they
learned
too
that
the
green
of
the
hilltop
and
of
the
meadow
was
more
than
grass
and
that
the
purple
haze
along
the
horizon
was
more
than
the
mountains
that
lay
between
them
and
the
next
state
they
were
beginning
to
see
the
world
with
david
eyes
there
were
too
the
long
twilights
and
evenings
when
david
on
the
wings
of
his
violin
would
speed
away
to
his
mountain
home
leaving
behind
him
a
man
and
a
woman
who
seemed
to
themselves
to
be
listening
to
the
voice
of
a
lad
who
once
played
at
their
knees
and
nestled
in
their
arms
when
the
day
was
done
and
here
too
the
hollys
were
learning
though
the
thing
thus
learned
was
hidden
deep
in
their
hearts
it
was
not
long
after
david
first
visit
that
the
boy
went
again
to
the
house
that
jack
built
as
the
gurnseys
called
their
tiny
home
though
in
reality
it
had
been
jack
father
who
had
built
the
house
jack
and
jill
however
did
not
always
deal
with
realities
it
was
not
a
pleasant
afternoon
there
was
a
light
mist
in
the
air
and
david
was
without
his
violin
i
came
to
to
inquire
for
the
cat
juliette
he
began
a
little
bashfully
i
thought
i
rather
do
that
than
read
he
explained
to
jill
in
the
doorway
good
i
so
glad
i
hoped
you
come
the
little
girl
welcomed
him
come
in
and
and
see
juliette
she
added
hastily
remembering
at
the
last
moment
that
her
brother
had
not
looked
with
entire
favor
on
her
avowed
admiration
for
this
strange
little
boy
juliette
roused
from
her
nap
was
at
first
inclined
to
resent
her
visitor
presence
in
five
minutes
however
she
was
purring
in
his
lap
the
conquest
of
the
kitten
once
accomplished
david
looked
about
him
a
little
restlessly
he
began
to
wonder
why
he
had
come
he
wished
he
had
gone
to
see
joe
glaspell
instead
he
wished
that
jill
would
not
sit
and
stare
at
him
like
that
he
wished
that
she
would
say
something
anything
but
jill
apparently
struck
dumb
with
embarrassment
was
nervously
twisting
the
corner
of
her
apron
into
a
little
knot
david
tried
to
recollect
what
he
had
talked
about
a
few
days
before
and
he
wondered
why
he
had
so
enjoyed
himself
then
he
wished
that
something
would
happen
anything
and
then
from
an
inner
room
came
the
sound
of
a
violin
david
raised
his
head
it
jack
stammered
the
little
girl
who
also
had
been
wishing
something
would
happen
he
plays
same
as
you
do
on
the
violin
does
he
beamed
david
but
he
paused
listening
a
quick
frown
on
his
face
over
and
over
the
violin
was
playing
a
single
phrase
and
the
variations
in
the
phrase
showed
the
indecision
of
the
fingers
and
of
the
mind
that
controlled
them
again
and
again
with
irritating
sameness
yet
with
a
still
more
irritating
difference
came
the
succession
of
notes
and
then
david
sprang
to
his
feet
placing
juliette
somewhat
unceremoniously
on
the
floor
much
to
that
petted
young
autocrat
disgust
here
where
is
he
let
me
show
him
cried
the
boy
and
at
the
note
of
command
in
his
voice
jill
involuntarily
rose
and
opened
the
door
to
jack
den
oh
please
jack
burst
out
david
hurrying
into
the
room
you
see
you
do
go
at
that
thing
right
if
you
just
let
me
show
you
a
minute
we
have
it
fixed
in
no
time
the
man
with
the
violin
stared
and
lowered
his
bow
a
slow
red
came
to
his
face
the
phrase
was
peculiarly
a
difficult
one
and
beyond
him
as
he
knew
but
that
did
not
make
the
present
intrusion
into
his
privacy
any
the
more
welcome
oh
will
we
indeed
he
retorted
a
little
sharply
do
trouble
yourself
i
beg
of
you
boy
but
it
is
a
mite
of
trouble
truly
urged
david
with
an
ardor
that
ignored
the
sarcasm
in
the
other
words
i
want
to
do
it
despite
his
annoyance
the
man
gave
a
short
laugh
well
david
i
believe
you
and
i
warrant
you
tackle
this
brahms
concerto
as
nonchalantly
as
you
did
those
six
hoodlums
with
the
cat
the
other
day
and
expect
to
win
out
too
but
truly
this
is
easy
when
you
know
how
laughed
the
boy
see
to
his
surprise
the
man
found
himself
relinquishing
the
violin
and
bow
into
the
slim
eager
hands
that
reached
for
them
the
next
moment
he
fell
back
in
amazement
clear
distinct
yet
connected
like
a
string
of
rounded
pearls
fell
the
troublesome
notes
from
david
bow
you
see
smiled
the
boy
again
and
played
the
phrase
a
second
time
more
slowly
and
with
deliberate
emphasis
at
the
difficult
part
then
as
if
in
answer
to
some
irresistible
summons
within
him
he
dashed
into
the
next
phrase
and
with
marvelous
technique
played
quite
through
the
rippling
cadenza
that
completed
the
movement
well
by
george
breathed
the
man
dazedly
as
he
took
the
offered
violin
the
next
moment
he
had
demanded
vehemently
for
heaven
sake
who
are
you
boy
david
face
wrinkled
in
grieved
surprise
why
i
david
do
you
remember
i
was
here
just
the
other
day
yes
yes
but
who
taught
you
to
play
like
that
father
the
man
echoed
the
word
with
a
gesture
of
comic
despair
first
latin
then
jiujitsu
and
now
the
violin
boy
who
was
your
father
david
lifted
his
head
and
frowned
a
little
he
had
been
questioned
so
often
and
so
unsympathetically
about
his
father
that
he
was
beginning
to
resent
it
he
was
daddy
just
daddy
and
i
loved
him
dearly
but
what
was
his
name
i
do
know
we
did
seem
to
have
a
name
like
like
yours
down
here
anyway
if
we
did
i
did
know
what
it
was
but
david
the
man
was
speaking
very
gently
now
he
had
motioned
the
boy
to
a
low
seat
by
his
side
the
little
girl
was
standing
near
her
eyes
alight
with
wondering
interest
he
must
have
had
a
name
you
know
just
the
same
did
you
ever
hear
any
one
call
him
anything
think
now
no
david
said
the
single
word
and
turned
his
eyes
away
it
had
occurred
to
him
since
he
had
come
to
live
in
the
valley
that
perhaps
his
father
did
not
want
to
have
his
name
known
he
remembered
that
once
the
boy
had
asked
what
to
call
him
and
his
father
had
laughed
and
answered
i
do
see
but
you
have
to
call
me
old
man
of
the
mountain
as
they
do
down
in
the
village
that
was
the
only
time
david
could
recollect
hearing
his
father
say
anything
about
his
name
at
the
time
david
had
not
thought
much
about
it
but
since
then
down
here
where
they
appeared
to
think
a
name
was
so
important
he
had
wondered
if
possibly
his
father
had
not
preferred
to
keep
his
to
himself
if
such
were
the
case
he
was
glad
now
that
he
did
not
know
this
name
so
that
he
might
not
have
to
tell
all
these
inquisitive
people
who
asked
so
many
questions
about
it
he
was
glad
too
that
those
men
had
not
been
able
to
read
his
father
name
at
the
end
of
his
other
note
that
first
morning
if
his
father
really
did
not
wish
his
name
to
be
known
but
david
think
where
you
lived
was
there
ever
anybody
who
called
him
by
name
david
shook
his
head
i
told
you
we
were
all
alone
father
and
i
in
the
little
house
far
up
on
the
mountain
and
your
mother
again
david
shook
his
head
she
is
an
and
do
live
in
houses
you
know
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
gently
the
man
asked
and
you
always
lived
there
six
years
father
said
and
before
that
i
do
remember
there
was
a
touch
of
injured
reserve
in
the
voice
which
the
man
was
quick
to
perceive
he
took
the
hint
at
once
he
must
have
been
a
wonderful
man
your
father
he
exclaimed
the
boy
turned
his
eyes
luminous
with
feeling
he
was
he
was
perfect
but
they
down
here
do
seem
to
know
or
care
he
choked
oh
but
that
because
they
do
understand
soothed
the
man
now
tell
me
you
must
have
practiced
a
lot
to
play
like
that
i
did
but
i
liked
it
and
what
else
did
you
do
and
how
did
you
happen
to
come
down
here
once
again
david
told
his
story
more
fully
perhaps
this
time
than
ever
before
because
of
the
sympathetic
ears
that
were
listening
but
now
he
finished
wistfully
it
all
so
different
and
i
down
here
alone
daddy
went
you
know
to
the
far
country
and
he
ca
come
back
from
there
who
told
you
that
daddy
himself
he
wrote
it
to
me
wrote
it
to
you
cried
the
man
sitting
suddenly
erect
yes
it
was
in
his
pocket
you
see
they
found
it
david
voice
was
very
low
and
not
quite
steady
david
may
i
see
that
letter
the
boy
hesitated
then
slowly
he
drew
it
from
his
pocket
yes
jack
i
let
you
see
it
reverently
tenderly
but
very
eagerly
the
man
took
the
note
and
read
it
through
hoping
somewhere
to
find
a
name
that
would
help
solve
the
mystery
with
a
sigh
he
handed
it
back
his
eyes
were
wet
thank
you
david
that
is
a
beautiful
letter
he
said
softly
and
i
believe
you
do
it
some
day
too
you
go
to
him
with
your
violin
at
your
chin
and
the
bow
drawn
across
the
strings
to
tell
him
of
the
beautiful
world
you
have
found
yes
sir
said
david
simply
then
with
a
suddenly
radiant
smile
and
now
i
ca
help
finding
it
a
beautiful
world
you
know
i
do
count
the
hours
i
do
like
you
do
what
oh
i
remember
returned
jack
a
quick
change
coming
to
his
face
yes
the
sundial
you
know
where
my
lady
of
the
roses
lives
jack
what
is
a
sundial
broke
in
jill
eagerly
jack
turned
as
if
in
relief
hullo
girlie
you
there
and
so
still
all
this
time
ask
david
he
tell
you
what
a
sundial
is
suppose
anyhow
that
you
two
go
out
on
the
piazza
now
i
got
work
to
do
and
the
sun
itself
is
out
see
through
the
trees
there
it
came
out
just
to
say
i
sure
run
along
quick
and
he
playfully
drove
them
from
the
room
alone
he
turned
and
sat
down
at
his
desk
his
work
was
before
him
but
he
did
not
do
it
his
eyes
were
out
of
the
window
on
the
golden
tops
of
the
towers
of
sunnycrest
motionless
he
watched
them
until
they
turned
in
the
twilight
then
he
picked
up
his
pencil
and
began
to
write
feverishly
he
went
to
the
window
however
as
david
stepped
off
the
veranda
and
called
merrily
remember
boy
that
when
there
another
note
that
baffles
me
going
to
send
for
you
he
coming
anyhow
i
asked
him
announced
jill
and
david
laughed
back
a
happy
of
course
i
am
chapter
xiv
the
tower
window
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
when
one
thoughts
lead
so
persistently
to
a
certain
place
one
feet
will
not
follow
if
they
can
and
david
could
so
he
went
to
seek
his
lady
of
the
roses
at
four
one
afternoon
with
his
violin
under
his
arm
he
traveled
the
firm
white
road
until
he
came
to
the
shadowed
path
that
led
to
the
garden
he
had
decided
that
he
would
go
exactly
as
he
went
before
he
expected
in
consequence
to
find
his
lady
exactly
as
he
had
found
her
before
sitting
reading
under
the
roses
great
was
his
surprise
and
disappointment
therefore
to
find
the
garden
with
no
one
in
it
he
had
told
himself
that
it
was
the
sundial
the
roses
the
shimmering
pool
the
garden
itself
that
he
wanted
to
see
but
he
knew
now
that
it
was
the
lady
his
lady
of
the
roses
he
did
not
even
care
to
play
though
all
around
him
was
the
beauty
that
had
at
first
so
charmed
his
eye
very
slowly
he
walked
across
the
sunlit
empty
space
and
entered
the
path
that
led
to
the
house
in
his
mind
was
no
definite
plan
yet
he
walked
on
and
on
until
he
came
to
the
wide
lawns
surrounding
the
house
itself
he
stopped
then
entranced
stone
upon
stone
the
majestic
pile
raised
itself
until
it
was
etched
against
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
the
towers
his
towers
brought
to
david
lips
a
cry
of
delight
they
were
even
more
enchanting
here
than
when
seen
from
afar
over
the
and
david
gazed
up
at
them
in
awed
wonder
from
somewhere
came
the
sound
of
music
a
curious
sort
of
music
that
david
had
never
heard
before
he
listened
intently
trying
to
place
it
then
slowly
he
crossed
the
lawn
ascended
the
imposing
stone
steps
and
softly
opened
one
of
the
narrow
screen
doors
before
the
french
window
once
within
the
room
david
drew
a
long
breath
of
ecstasy
beneath
his
feet
he
felt
the
velvet
softness
of
the
green
moss
of
the
woods
above
his
head
he
saw
a
canopy
of
blue
carrying
fleecy
clouds
on
which
floated
little
children
with
wings
just
as
david
himself
had
so
often
wished
that
he
could
float
on
all
sides
silken
hangings
like
the
green
of
swaying
vines
other
hangings
of
feathery
snowflake
lace
everywhere
mirrored
walls
caught
the
light
and
reflected
the
potted
ferns
and
palms
so
that
david
looked
down
endless
vistas
of
loveliness
that
seemed
for
all
the
world
like
the
long
sunflecked
aisles
beneath
the
tall
pines
of
his
mountain
home
the
music
that
david
had
heard
at
first
had
long
since
stopped
but
david
had
not
noticed
that
he
stood
now
in
the
center
of
the
room
awed
and
trembling
but
enraptured
then
from
somewhere
came
a
voice
a
voice
so
cold
that
it
sounded
as
if
it
had
swept
across
a
field
of
ice
well
boy
when
you
have
quite
finished
your
inspection
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
to
what
i
am
indebted
for
this
visit
it
said
david
turned
abruptly
o
lady
of
the
roses
why
did
you
tell
me
it
was
like
this
in
here
he
breathed
well
really
murmured
the
lady
in
the
doorway
stiffly
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
that
was
hardly
necessary
but
it
was
do
you
see
this
is
new
all
new
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
before
and
i
do
so
love
new
things
it
gives
me
something
new
to
play
do
you
understand
new
to
play
yes
on
my
violin
explained
david
a
little
breathlessly
softly
testing
his
violin
there
always
something
new
in
this
you
know
he
hurried
on
as
he
tightened
one
of
the
strings
when
anything
new
outside
now
listen
you
see
i
do
know
myself
just
how
it
going
to
sound
and
i
always
so
anxious
to
find
out
and
with
a
joyously
rapt
face
he
began
to
play
but
see
here
boy
you
must
you
the
words
died
on
her
lips
and
to
her
unbounded
amazement
miss
barbara
holbrook
who
had
intended
peremptorily
to
send
this
persistent
little
tramp
boy
about
his
business
found
herself
listening
to
a
melody
so
compelling
in
its
sonorous
beauty
that
she
was
left
almost
speechless
at
its
close
it
was
the
boy
who
spoke
there
i
told
you
my
violin
would
know
what
to
say
to
say
well
that
more
than
i
do
laughed
miss
holbrook
a
little
hysterically
boy
come
here
and
tell
me
who
you
are
and
she
led
the
way
to
a
low
divan
that
stood
near
a
harp
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
it
was
the
same
story
told
as
david
had
told
it
to
jack
and
jill
a
few
days
before
only
this
time
david
eyes
were
roving
admiringly
all
about
the
room
resting
oftenest
on
the
harp
so
near
him
did
that
make
the
music
that
i
heard
he
asked
eagerly
as
soon
as
miss
holbrook
questions
gave
him
opportunity
it
got
strings
yes
i
was
playing
when
you
came
in
i
saw
you
enter
the
window
really
david
are
you
in
the
habit
of
walking
into
people
houses
like
this
it
is
most
disconcerting
to
their
owners
yes
no
well
sometimes
david
eyes
were
still
on
the
harp
lady
of
the
roses
wo
you
please
play
again
on
that
david
you
are
incorrigible
why
did
you
come
into
my
house
like
this
the
music
said
and
the
towers
too
you
see
i
know
the
towers
you
know
them
yes
i
can
see
them
from
so
many
places
and
i
always
watch
for
them
they
show
best
of
anywhere
though
from
jack
and
jill
and
now
you
play
miss
holbrook
had
almost
risen
to
her
feet
when
she
turned
abruptly
from
where
she
asked
from
jack
and
jill
the
house
that
jack
built
you
know
you
mean
john
gurnsey
house
a
deeper
color
had
come
into
miss
holbrook
cheeks
yes
over
there
at
the
top
of
the
little
hill
across
the
brook
you
know
you
ca
see
their
house
from
here
but
from
over
there
we
can
see
the
towers
finely
and
the
little
window
oh
lady
of
the
roses
he
broke
off
excitedly
at
the
new
thought
that
had
come
to
him
if
we
now
were
in
that
little
window
we
could
see
their
house
let
go
up
ca
we
explicit
as
this
was
miss
holbrook
evidently
did
not
hear
or
at
least
did
not
understand
this
request
she
settled
back
on
the
divan
indeed
almost
determinedly
her
cheeks
were
very
red
now
and
do
you
know
this
mr
jack
she
asked
lightly
yes
and
jill
too
do
you
i
like
them
too
do
you
know
them
again
miss
holbrook
ignored
the
question
put
to
her
and
did
you
walk
into
their
house
unannounced
and
uninvited
like
this
she
queried
no
he
asked
me
you
see
he
wanted
to
get
off
some
of
the
dirt
and
blood
before
other
folks
saw
me
the
dirt
and
and
why
david
what
do
you
mean
what
was
it
an
accident
david
frowned
and
reflected
a
moment
no
i
did
it
on
purpose
i
had
to
you
see
he
finally
elucidated
but
there
were
six
of
them
and
i
got
the
worst
of
it
david
miss
holbrook
voice
was
horrified
you
do
mean
a
fight
yes
i
wanted
the
cat
and
i
got
it
but
i
would
have
if
jack
had
come
to
help
me
oh
so
jack
fought
too
well
he
pulled
the
others
off
and
of
course
that
helped
me
explained
david
truthfully
and
then
he
took
me
home
he
and
jill
jill
was
she
in
it
no
only
her
cat
they
had
tied
a
bag
over
its
head
and
a
tin
can
to
its
tail
and
of
course
i
could
let
them
do
that
they
were
hurting
her
and
now
lady
of
the
roses
wo
you
please
play
for
a
moment
miss
holbrook
did
not
speak
she
was
gazing
at
david
with
an
odd
look
in
her
eyes
at
last
she
drew
a
long
sigh
david
you
are
the
the
limit
she
breathed
as
she
rose
and
seated
herself
at
the
harp
david
was
manifestly
delighted
with
her
playing
and
begged
for
more
when
she
had
finished
but
miss
holbrook
shook
her
head
she
seemed
to
have
grown
suddenly
restless
and
she
moved
about
the
room
calling
david
attention
to
something
new
each
moment
then
very
abruptly
she
suggested
that
they
go
upstairs
from
room
to
room
she
hurried
the
boy
scarcely
listening
to
his
ardent
comments
or
answering
his
still
more
ardent
questions
not
until
they
reached
the
highest
tower
room
indeed
did
she
sink
wearily
into
a
chair
and
seem
for
a
moment
at
rest
david
looked
about
him
in
surprise
even
his
untrained
eye
could
see
that
he
had
entered
a
different
world
there
were
no
sumptuous
rugs
no
silken
hangings
no
mirrors
no
snowflake
curtains
there
were
books
to
be
sure
but
besides
those
there
were
only
a
plain
low
table
a
and
three
or
four
though
comfortable
chairs
with
increasing
wonder
he
looked
into
miss
holbrook
eyes
is
it
here
that
you
stay
all
day
he
asked
diffidently
miss
holbrook
face
turned
a
vivid
scarlet
why
david
what
a
question
of
course
not
why
should
you
think
i
did
nothing
only
i
been
wondering
all
the
time
i
been
here
how
you
could
with
all
those
beautiful
things
around
you
downstairs
say
what
you
did
say
what
when
that
other
day
in
the
garden
about
all
your
hours
being
cloudy
ones
so
i
did
know
but
what
you
lived
up
here
same
as
holly
does
use
her
best
rooms
and
that
was
why
your
hours
were
all
cloudy
ones
with
a
sudden
movement
miss
holbrook
rose
to
her
feet
nonsense
david
you
should
always
remember
everything
that
people
say
to
you
come
you
have
seen
one
of
the
views
from
the
windows
yet
we
are
in
the
larger
tower
you
know
you
can
see
hinsdale
village
on
this
side
and
there
a
fine
view
of
the
mountains
over
there
oh
yes
and
from
the
other
side
there
your
friend
house
jack
by
the
way
how
is
jack
these
days
miss
holbrook
stooped
as
she
asked
the
question
and
picked
up
a
bit
of
thread
from
the
rug
david
ran
at
once
to
the
window
that
looked
toward
the
house
that
jack
built
from
the
tower
the
little
house
appeared
to
be
smaller
than
ever
it
was
in
the
shadow
too
and
looked
strangely
alone
and
forlorn
unconsciously
as
he
gazed
at
it
david
compared
it
with
the
magnificence
he
had
just
seen
his
voice
choked
as
he
answered
he
is
well
lady
of
the
roses
and
he
unhappy
he
awfully
unhappy
miss
holbrook
slender
figure
came
up
with
a
jerk
what
do
you
mean
boy
how
do
you
know
he
unhappy
has
he
said
so
no
but
holly
told
me
about
him
he
sick
and
he
just
found
his
work
to
do
out
in
the
world
when
he
had
to
stop
and
come
home
but
oh
quick
there
he
is
see
instead
of
coming
nearer
miss
holbrook
fell
back
to
the
center
of
the
room
but
her
eyes
were
still
turned
toward
the
little
house
yes
i
see
she
murmured
the
next
instant
she
had
snatched
a
handkerchief
from
david
outstretched
hand
no
no
i
would
wave
she
remonstrated
hurriedly
come
come
downstairs
with
me
but
i
thought
i
was
sure
he
was
looking
this
way
asserted
david
turning
reluctantly
from
the
window
and
if
he
had
seen
me
wave
to
him
he
have
been
so
glad
now
would
he
there
was
no
answer
the
lady
of
the
roses
did
not
apparently
hear
she
had
gone
on
down
the
stairway
chapter
xv
secrets
david
had
so
much
to
tell
jack
and
jill
that
he
went
to
see
them
the
very
next
day
after
his
second
visit
to
sunnycrest
he
carried
his
violin
with
him
he
found
however
only
jill
at
home
she
was
sitting
on
the
veranda
steps
there
was
not
so
much
embarrassment
between
them
this
time
perhaps
because
they
were
in
the
freedom
of
the
wide
and
david
felt
more
at
ease
he
was
plainly
disappointed
however
that
jack
was
not
there
but
i
wanted
to
see
him
i
wanted
to
see
him
he
lamented
you
better
stay
then
he
be
home
by
and
by
comforted
jill
he
gone
what
that
jill
chuckled
well
you
see
really
it
this
way
he
sells
something
to
boil
in
other
people
pots
so
he
can
have
something
to
boil
in
ours
he
says
it
stuff
from
the
garden
you
know
we
raise
it
to
sell
poor
jack
and
he
does
hate
it
so
david
nodded
sympathetically
i
know
and
it
must
be
awful
just
hoeing
and
weeding
all
the
time
still
of
course
he
knows
he
got
to
do
it
because
it
out
of
doors
and
he
just
has
to
be
out
of
doors
all
he
can
rejoined
the
girl
he
sick
you
know
and
sometimes
he
so
unhappy
he
say
much
jack
never
says
much
only
with
his
face
but
i
know
and
it
it
just
makes
me
want
to
cry
at
david
dismayed
exclamation
jill
jumped
to
her
feet
it
owned
to
her
suddenly
that
she
was
telling
this
unknown
boy
altogether
too
many
of
the
family
secrets
she
proposed
at
once
a
race
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
then
to
drive
david
mind
still
farther
away
from
the
subject
under
recent
consideration
she
deliberately
lost
and
proclaimed
him
the
victor
very
soon
however
there
arose
new
complications
in
the
shape
of
a
little
gate
that
led
to
a
path
which
in
its
turn
led
to
a
footbridge
across
the
narrow
span
of
the
little
stream
above
the
trees
on
the
other
side
peeped
the
top
of
highest
tower
to
the
lady
of
the
roses
cried
david
eagerly
i
know
it
goes
there
come
let
see
the
little
girl
shook
her
head
i
ca
why
not
jack
wo
let
me
but
it
goes
to
a
beautiful
place
i
was
there
yesterday
argued
david
and
i
was
up
in
the
tower
and
almost
waved
to
jack
on
the
piazza
back
there
i
saw
him
and
maybe
she
let
you
and
me
go
up
there
again
but
i
ca
i
say
repeated
jill
a
little
impatiently
jack
let
me
even
start
why
not
maybe
he
does
know
where
it
goes
to
jill
hung
her
head
then
she
raised
it
defiantly
oh
yes
he
does
i
told
him
i
used
to
go
when
i
was
littler
and
he
was
here
i
went
once
after
he
came
halfway
and
he
saw
me
and
called
to
me
i
had
got
halfway
across
the
bridge
but
i
had
to
come
back
he
was
very
angry
yet
sort
of
queer
too
his
face
was
all
stern
and
white
and
his
lips
snapped
tight
shut
after
every
word
he
said
never
never
never
to
let
him
find
me
the
other
side
of
that
gate
david
frowned
as
they
turned
to
go
up
the
hill
unhesitatingly
he
determined
to
instruct
jack
in
this
little
matter
he
would
tell
him
what
a
beautiful
place
sunnycrest
was
and
he
would
try
to
convince
him
how
very
desirable
it
was
that
he
and
jill
and
even
jack
himself
should
go
across
the
bridge
at
the
very
first
opportunity
that
offered
jack
came
home
before
long
but
david
quite
forgot
to
speak
of
the
footbridge
just
then
chiefly
because
jack
got
out
his
violin
and
asked
david
to
come
in
and
play
a
duet
with
him
the
duet
however
soon
became
a
solo
for
so
great
was
jack
delight
in
playing
that
he
placed
before
the
boy
one
sheet
of
music
after
another
begging
and
still
begging
for
more
david
nothing
loath
played
on
and
on
most
of
the
music
he
knew
having
already
learned
it
in
his
mountain
home
like
old
friends
the
melodies
seemed
and
so
glad
was
david
to
see
their
notes
again
that
he
finished
each
production
with
a
little
improvised
cadenza
of
ecstatic
welcome
to
jack
increasing
surprise
and
delight
great
scott
you
a
wonder
david
he
exclaimed
at
last
pooh
as
if
that
was
anything
wonderful
laughed
the
boy
why
i
knew
those
ages
ago
jack
it
only
that
i
so
glad
to
see
them
again
the
notes
you
know
you
see
i
have
any
music
now
it
was
all
in
the
bag
what
we
brought
and
we
left
that
on
the
way
you
left
it
yes
was
so
heavy
murmured
david
abstractedly
his
fingers
busy
with
the
pile
of
music
before
him
oh
and
here
another
one
he
cried
exultingly
this
is
where
the
wind
sighs
oou
through
the
pines
listen
and
he
was
away
again
on
the
wings
of
his
violin
when
he
had
returned
jack
drew
a
long
breath
david
you
are
a
wonder
he
declared
again
and
that
violin
of
yours
is
a
wonder
too
if
i
not
mistaken
though
i
do
know
enough
to
tell
whether
it
really
a
rare
one
or
not
was
it
your
father
oh
no
he
had
one
too
and
they
both
are
good
ones
father
said
so
joe
got
father
now
joe
joe
glaspell
you
do
mean
widow
glaspell
joe
the
blind
boy
i
did
know
he
could
play
he
could
till
i
showed
him
but
he
likes
to
hear
me
play
and
he
understood
right
away
i
mean
understood
what
i
was
playing
you
know
and
he
was
almost
the
first
one
that
did
since
father
went
away
and
now
i
play
every
time
i
go
there
joe
says
he
never
knew
before
how
trees
and
grass
and
sunsets
and
sunrises
and
birds
and
little
brooks
did
look
till
i
told
him
with
my
violin
now
he
says
he
thinks
he
can
see
them
better
than
i
can
because
as
long
as
his
outside
eyes
ca
see
anything
they
ca
see
those
ugly
things
all
around
him
and
so
he
can
just
make
his
inside
eyes
see
only
the
beautiful
things
that
he
like
to
see
and
that
the
kind
he
does
see
when
i
play
that
why
i
said
he
understood
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
in
jack
eyes
there
was
an
odd
look
as
they
rested
on
david
face
then
abruptly
he
spoke
david
i
wish
i
had
money
i
put
you
then
where
you
belonged
he
sighed
do
you
mean
where
i
find
my
work
to
do
asked
the
boy
softly
well
yes
you
might
say
it
that
way
smiled
the
man
after
a
moment
hesitation
not
yet
was
jack
quite
used
to
this
boy
who
was
at
times
so
very
father
told
me
was
waiting
for
me
somewhere
jack
frowned
thoughtfully
and
he
was
right
david
the
only
trouble
is
we
like
to
pick
it
out
for
ourselves
pretty
well
too
well
as
we
find
out
sometimes
when
we
called
off
for
another
job
i
know
jack
i
know
breathed
david
and
the
man
looking
into
the
glowing
dark
eyes
wondered
at
what
he
found
there
it
was
almost
as
if
the
boy
really
understood
about
his
own
disappointment
and
cared
though
that
of
course
could
not
be
and
it
all
the
harder
to
keep
ourselves
in
tune
then
too
is
it
went
on
david
a
little
wistfully
in
tune
with
the
rest
of
the
orchestra
oh
and
jack
who
had
already
heard
about
the
orchestra
of
life
smiled
a
bit
sadly
that
just
it
my
boy
and
if
we
handed
another
instrument
to
play
on
than
the
one
we
want
to
play
on
apt
to
to
let
fly
a
discord
anyhow
i
am
but
he
went
on
more
lightly
now
in
your
case
david
little
as
i
know
about
the
violin
i
know
enough
to
understand
that
you
ought
to
be
where
you
can
take
up
your
study
of
it
again
where
you
can
hear
good
music
and
where
you
can
be
among
those
who
know
enough
to
appreciate
what
you
do
david
eyes
sparkled
and
where
there
would
be
any
pulling
weeds
or
hoeing
dirt
well
i
had
thought
of
including
either
of
those
pastimes
my
but
i
would
like
that
mr
jack
but
that
would
be
work
so
that
could
be
what
father
meant
david
face
fell
well
i
would
worry
about
the
part
laughed
jack
particularly
as
you
are
going
to
do
it
just
now
there
the
money
you
know
and
we
have
got
that
and
it
takes
money
well
yes
you
ca
get
those
things
here
in
hinsdale
you
know
and
it
takes
money
to
get
away
and
to
live
away
after
you
get
there
a
sudden
light
transfigured
david
face
jack
would
gold
do
it
lots
of
little
round
i
think
it
would
david
if
there
were
enough
of
them
many
as
a
hundred
sure
if
they
were
big
enough
anyway
david
they
start
you
and
i
thinking
you
would
need
but
a
start
before
you
be
coining
of
your
own
out
of
that
violin
of
yours
but
why
anybody
you
know
got
as
as
a
hundred
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
for
a
moment
david
his
delighted
thoughts
flying
to
the
in
the
chimney
cupboard
of
his
room
was
tempted
to
tell
his
secret
then
he
remembered
the
woman
with
the
bread
and
the
pail
of
milk
and
decided
not
to
he
would
wait
when
he
knew
jack
better
perhaps
then
he
would
tell
but
not
now
now
jack
might
think
he
was
a
thief
and
that
he
could
not
bear
so
he
took
up
his
violin
and
began
to
play
and
in
the
charm
of
the
music
jack
seemed
to
forget
the
which
was
exactly
what
david
had
intended
should
happen
not
until
david
had
said
some
time
later
did
he
remember
the
purpose
the
special
purpose
for
which
he
had
come
he
turned
back
with
a
radiant
face
oh
and
jack
i
forgot
he
cried
i
was
going
to
tell
you
i
saw
you
yesterday
i
did
and
i
almost
waved
to
you
did
you
where
were
you
over
there
in
the
window
the
tower
window
he
crowed
jubilantly
oh
you
went
again
then
i
suppose
to
see
miss
holbrook
the
man
voice
sounded
so
oddly
cold
and
distant
that
david
noticed
it
at
once
he
was
reminded
suddenly
of
the
gate
and
the
footbridge
which
jill
was
forbidden
to
cross
but
he
dared
not
speak
of
it
then
not
when
jack
looked
like
that
he
did
say
however
oh
but
jack
it
such
a
beautiful
place
you
do
know
what
a
beautiful
place
it
is
is
it
then
you
like
it
so
much
oh
so
much
but
did
you
ever
see
it
why
yes
i
believe
i
did
david
long
ago
murmured
jack
with
what
seemed
to
david
amazing
indifference
and
did
you
see
her
my
lady
of
the
roses
why
y
yes
i
believe
so
and
is
that
all
you
remember
about
it
resented
david
highly
offended
the
man
gave
a
laugh
a
little
short
hard
laugh
that
david
did
not
like
but
let
me
see
you
said
you
almost
waved
did
you
why
did
you
quite
asked
the
man
david
drew
himself
suddenly
erect
instinctively
he
felt
that
his
lady
of
the
roses
needed
defense
because
she
did
want
me
to
so
i
did
of
course
he
rejoined
with
dignity
she
took
away
my
handkerchief
i
warrant
she
did
muttered
the
man
behind
his
teeth
aloud
he
only
laughed
again
as
he
turned
away
david
went
on
down
the
steps
dissatisfied
vaguely
with
himself
with
jack
and
even
with
the
lady
of
the
roses
chapter
xvi
david
castle
in
spain
on
his
return
from
the
house
that
jack
built
david
decided
to
count
his
he
got
them
out
at
once
from
behind
the
books
and
stacked
them
up
in
little
shining
rows
as
he
had
surmised
there
were
a
hundred
of
them
there
were
indeed
a
hundred
and
six
he
was
pleased
at
that
one
hundred
and
six
were
surely
enough
to
give
him
a
start
a
start
david
closed
his
eyes
and
pictured
it
to
go
on
with
his
violin
to
hear
good
music
to
be
with
people
who
understood
what
he
said
when
he
played
that
was
what
jack
had
said
a
start
was
and
this
gold
these
round
shining
bits
of
gold
could
bring
him
this
david
swept
the
little
piles
into
a
jingling
heap
and
sprang
to
his
feet
with
both
fists
full
of
his
suddenly
beloved
wealth
with
boyish
glee
he
capered
about
the
room
jingling
the
coins
in
his
hands
then
very
soberly
he
sat
down
again
and
began
to
gather
the
gold
to
put
away
he
would
be
wise
he
would
be
sensible
he
would
watch
his
chance
and
when
it
came
he
would
go
away
first
however
he
would
tell
jack
and
joe
and
the
lady
of
the
roses
yes
and
the
hollys
too
just
now
there
seemed
to
be
work
real
work
that
he
could
do
to
help
holly
but
later
possibly
when
september
came
and
school
they
had
said
he
must
go
to
school
he
would
tell
them
then
and
go
away
instead
he
would
see
by
that
time
they
would
believe
him
perhaps
when
he
showed
the
they
would
not
think
he
had
stolen
them
it
was
august
now
he
would
wait
but
meanwhile
he
could
think
he
could
always
be
thinking
of
the
wonderful
thing
that
this
gold
was
one
day
to
bring
to
him
even
work
to
david
did
not
seem
work
now
in
the
morning
he
was
to
rake
hay
behind
the
men
with
the
cart
yesterday
he
had
not
liked
it
very
well
but
now
nothing
mattered
now
and
with
a
satisfied
sigh
david
put
his
precious
gold
away
again
behind
the
books
in
the
cupboard
david
found
a
new
song
in
his
violin
the
next
morning
to
be
sure
he
could
not
play
it
much
of
it
until
four
in
the
afternoon
came
for
holly
did
not
like
violins
to
be
played
in
the
morning
even
on
days
that
were
not
especially
the
lord
there
was
too
much
work
to
do
so
david
could
only
snatch
a
strain
or
two
very
very
softly
while
he
was
dressing
but
that
was
enough
to
show
him
what
a
beautiful
song
it
was
going
to
be
he
knew
what
it
was
at
once
too
it
was
the
and
what
they
would
bring
all
through
the
day
it
tripped
through
his
consciousness
and
danced
tantalizingly
just
out
of
reach
yet
he
was
wonderfully
happy
and
the
day
seemed
short
in
spite
of
the
heat
and
the
weariness
at
four
he
hurried
home
and
put
his
violin
quickly
in
tune
it
came
then
that
dancing
sprite
of
tantalization
and
joyously
abandoned
itself
to
the
strings
of
the
violin
so
that
david
knew
of
a
surety
what
a
beautiful
song
it
was
it
was
this
song
that
sent
him
the
next
afternoon
to
see
his
lady
of
the
roses
he
found
her
this
time
out
of
doors
in
her
garden
unceremoniously
as
usual
he
rushed
headlong
into
her
presence
oh
lady
lady
of
the
roses
he
panted
i
found
out
and
i
came
quickly
to
tell
you
why
david
what
what
do
you
mean
miss
holbrook
looked
unmistakably
startled
about
the
hours
you
know
the
unclouded
ones
explained
david
eagerly
you
know
you
said
they
were
all
cloudy
to
you
miss
holbrook
face
grew
very
white
you
mean
you
found
out
why
my
hours
are
are
all
cloudy
ones
she
stammered
no
oh
no
i
ca
imagine
why
they
are
returned
david
with
an
emphatic
shake
of
his
head
it
just
that
i
found
a
way
to
make
all
my
hours
sunny
ones
and
you
can
do
it
too
so
i
came
to
tell
you
you
know
you
said
yours
were
all
cloudy
oh
ejaculated
miss
holbrook
falling
back
into
her
old
listless
attitude
then
with
some
asperity
dear
me
david
did
i
tell
you
not
to
be
remembering
that
all
the
time
yes
i
know
but
i
learned
something
urged
the
boy
something
that
you
ought
to
know
you
see
i
did
think
once
that
because
you
had
all
these
beautiful
things
around
you
the
hours
ought
to
be
all
sunny
ones
but
now
i
know
it
is
what
around
you
it
what
is
in
you
oh
david
david
you
curious
boy
no
but
really
let
me
tell
you
pleaded
david
you
know
i
liked
them
all
those
hours
till
four
came
and
i
was
so
glad
after
i
saw
the
sundial
to
find
out
that
they
did
count
anyhow
but
they
have
counted
they
all
counted
lady
of
the
roses
and
it
just
because
there
was
something
inside
of
me
that
shone
and
shone
and
made
them
all
sunny
those
hours
dear
me
and
what
was
this
wonderful
thing
david
smiled
but
he
shook
his
head
i
ca
tell
you
that
yet
in
words
but
i
play
it
you
see
i
ca
always
play
them
twice
alike
those
little
songs
that
i
find
but
this
one
i
can
it
sang
so
long
in
my
head
before
my
violin
had
a
chance
to
tell
me
what
it
really
was
that
i
sort
of
learned
it
now
listen
and
he
began
to
play
it
was
indeed
a
beautiful
song
and
miss
holbrook
said
so
with
promptness
and
enthusiasm
yet
still
david
frowned
yes
yes
he
answered
but
do
you
see
that
was
telling
you
about
something
inside
of
me
that
made
all
my
hours
sunshiny
ones
now
what
you
want
is
something
inside
of
you
to
make
yours
sunshiny
too
you
see
an
odd
look
came
into
miss
holbrook
eyes
that
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
david
but
you
have
told
me
yet
you
know
just
what
it
is
that
made
all
this
brightness
for
you
the
boy
changed
his
position
and
puckered
his
forehead
into
a
deeper
frown
i
do
seem
to
explain
so
you
can
understand
he
sighed
it
the
special
thing
it
only
that
it
something
and
it
thinking
about
it
that
does
it
now
mine
would
make
yours
shine
but
still
he
broke
off
a
happy
relief
in
his
eyes
yours
could
be
like
mine
in
one
way
mine
is
something
that
is
going
to
happen
to
me
something
just
beautiful
and
you
could
have
that
you
know
something
that
was
going
to
happen
to
you
to
think
about
miss
holbrook
smiled
but
only
with
her
lips
her
eyes
had
grown
somber
but
there
is
anything
beautiful
going
to
happen
to
me
david
she
demurred
there
could
could
there
miss
holbrook
bit
her
lip
then
she
gave
an
odd
little
laugh
that
seemed
in
some
way
to
go
with
the
swift
red
that
had
come
to
her
cheeks
i
used
to
think
there
could
once
she
admitted
but
i
given
that
up
long
ago
it
it
did
happen
but
could
you
just
think
it
was
going
to
persisted
the
boy
you
see
i
found
out
yesterday
that
it
the
thinking
that
does
it
all
day
long
i
was
thinking
only
thinking
i
was
doing
it
at
all
i
was
really
raking
behind
the
cart
but
the
hours
all
were
sunny
miss
holbrook
laughed
now
outright
what
a
persistent
little
preacher
you
are
she
exclaimed
and
there
truth
more
truth
than
you
know
in
it
all
too
but
i
ca
do
it
david
not
that
not
that
would
take
more
than
thinking
to
bring
that
she
added
under
her
breath
as
if
to
herself
but
thinking
does
bring
things
maintained
david
earnestly
joe
joe
glaspell
his
mother
works
out
all
day
and
he
blind
blind
shuddered
miss
holbrook
yes
and
he
has
to
stay
all
alone
except
for
betty
and
she
is
there
much
he
thinks
all
his
things
he
has
to
he
ca
see
anything
with
his
outside
eyes
but
he
sees
everything
with
his
inside
eyes
everything
that
i
play
why
lady
of
the
roses
he
even
seen
this
all
this
here
i
told
him
about
it
you
know
right
away
after
i
found
you
that
first
day
the
big
trees
and
the
long
shadows
across
the
grass
and
the
roses
and
the
shining
water
and
the
lovely
marble
people
peeping
through
the
green
leaves
and
the
sundial
and
you
so
beautiful
sitting
here
in
the
middle
of
it
all
then
i
played
it
for
him
and
he
said
he
could
see
it
all
just
as
plain
and
that
was
with
his
inside
eyes
and
so
if
joe
shut
up
there
in
his
dark
little
room
can
make
his
think
bring
him
all
that
i
should
think
that
you
here
in
this
beautiful
beautiful
place
could
make
your
think
bring
you
anything
you
wanted
it
to
but
miss
holbrook
sighed
again
and
shook
her
head
not
that
david
not
that
she
murmured
it
would
take
more
than
thinking
to
bring
that
then
with
a
quick
change
of
manner
she
cried
come
come
suppose
we
do
worry
any
more
about
my
hours
let
think
of
yours
tell
me
what
have
you
been
doing
since
i
saw
you
last
perhaps
you
have
been
again
to
to
see
jack
for
instance
i
have
but
i
saw
jill
mostly
till
the
last
david
hesitated
then
he
blurted
it
out
lady
of
the
roses
do
you
know
about
the
gate
and
the
footbridge
miss
holbrook
looked
up
quickly
know
what
david
know
about
them
that
they
there
why
yes
of
course
at
least
i
suppose
you
mean
the
footbridge
that
crosses
the
little
stream
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
over
there
that
the
one
again
david
hesitated
and
again
he
blurted
out
the
burden
of
his
thoughts
lady
of
the
roses
did
you
ever
cross
that
bridge
miss
holbrook
stirred
uneasily
not
recently
but
you
do
mind
folks
crossing
it
certainly
not
if
they
wish
to
there
i
knew
was
your
blame
triumphed
david
my
blame
yes
that
jack
would
let
jill
come
across
you
know
he
called
her
back
when
she
got
halfway
over
once
miss
holbrook
face
changed
color
but
i
do
object
she
cried
sharply
to
their
crossing
it
when
they
do
want
to
do
forget
that
please
but
jill
did
want
to
how
about
her
brother
did
he
want
her
to
n
no
very
well
then
i
did
either
david
frowned
never
had
he
seen
his
beloved
lady
of
the
roses
look
like
this
before
he
was
reminded
of
what
jill
had
said
about
jack
his
face
was
all
stern
and
white
and
his
lips
snapped
tight
shut
after
every
word
so
too
looked
miss
holbrook
face
so
too
had
her
lips
snapped
tight
shut
after
her
last
words
david
could
not
understand
it
he
said
nothing
more
however
but
as
was
usually
the
case
when
he
was
perplexed
he
picked
up
his
violin
and
began
to
play
and
as
he
played
there
gradually
came
to
miss
holbrook
eyes
a
softer
light
and
to
her
lips
lines
less
tightly
drawn
neither
the
footbridge
nor
jack
however
was
mentioned
again
that
afternoon
chapter
xvii
the
princess
and
the
pauper
it
was
in
the
early
twilight
that
jack
told
the
story
he
jill
and
david
were
on
the
veranda
as
usual
watching
the
towers
of
sunnycrest
turn
from
gold
to
silver
as
the
sun
dropped
behind
the
hills
it
was
jill
who
had
asked
for
the
story
about
fairies
and
princesses
you
know
she
had
ordered
but
how
will
david
like
that
jack
had
demurred
maybe
he
does
care
for
fairies
and
princesses
i
read
one
once
about
a
prince
was
prince
and
the
pauper
and
i
liked
that
averred
david
stoutly
jack
smiled
then
his
brows
drew
together
in
a
frown
his
eyes
were
moodily
fixed
on
the
towers
well
he
said
i
might
i
suppose
tell
you
a
story
about
a
princess
and
a
pauper
i
know
one
well
enough
good
then
tell
it
cried
both
jill
and
david
and
jack
began
his
story
she
was
not
always
a
princess
and
he
was
not
always
a
pauper
and
that
where
the
story
came
in
i
suppose
sighed
the
man
she
was
just
a
girl
once
and
he
was
a
boy
and
they
played
together
and
liked
each
other
he
lived
in
a
little
house
on
a
hill
like
this
demanded
jill
eh
oh
er
yes
something
like
this
returned
jack
with
an
odd
and
she
lived
in
another
bit
of
a
house
in
a
town
far
away
from
the
boy
then
how
could
they
play
together
questioned
david
they
could
always
it
was
only
summers
when
she
came
to
visit
in
the
boy
town
she
was
very
near
him
then
for
the
old
aunt
whom
she
visited
lived
in
a
big
stone
house
with
towers
on
another
hill
in
plain
sight
from
the
boy
home
towers
like
those
where
the
lady
of
the
roses
lives
asked
david
eh
what
oh
er
yes
murmured
jack
we
say
the
towers
were
something
like
those
over
there
he
paused
then
went
on
musingly
the
girl
used
to
signal
sometimes
from
one
of
the
tower
windows
one
wave
of
the
handkerchief
meant
coming
over
two
waves
with
a
little
pause
between
meant
are
to
come
over
here
so
the
boy
used
to
wait
always
after
that
first
wave
to
see
if
another
followed
so
that
he
might
know
whether
he
were
to
be
host
or
guest
that
day
the
waves
always
came
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
very
eagerly
the
boy
used
to
watch
for
them
all
through
the
summer
when
the
girl
was
there
did
they
always
come
every
morning
asked
jill
no
sometimes
the
girl
had
other
things
to
do
her
aunt
would
want
her
to
go
somewhere
with
her
or
other
cousins
were
expected
whom
the
girl
must
entertain
and
she
knew
the
boy
did
not
like
other
guests
to
be
there
when
he
was
so
she
never
asked
him
to
come
over
at
such
times
on
such
occasions
she
did
sometimes
run
up
to
the
tower
at
eight
and
wave
three
times
and
that
meant
day
so
the
boy
after
all
never
drew
a
real
breath
of
relief
until
he
made
sure
that
no
dreaded
third
wave
was
to
follow
the
one
or
the
two
seems
to
me
observed
david
that
all
this
was
sort
of
did
the
boy
say
anything
oh
yes
smiled
jack
but
the
boy
did
not
have
any
tower
to
wave
from
you
must
remember
he
had
only
the
little
piazza
on
his
tiny
bit
of
a
house
but
he
rigged
up
a
pole
and
he
asked
his
mother
to
make
him
two
little
flags
a
red
and
a
blue
one
the
red
meant
right
and
the
blue
meant
to
work
and
these
he
used
to
run
up
on
his
pole
in
answer
to
her
waving
coming
over
or
are
to
come
over
here
so
you
see
occasionally
it
was
the
boy
who
had
to
bring
the
day
as
there
were
times
when
he
had
to
work
and
by
the
way
perhaps
you
would
be
interested
to
know
that
after
a
while
he
thought
up
a
third
flag
to
answer
her
three
waves
he
found
an
old
black
silk
handkerchief
of
his
father
and
he
made
that
into
a
flag
he
told
the
girl
it
meant
heartbroken
and
he
said
it
was
a
sign
of
the
deepest
mourning
the
girl
laughed
and
tipped
her
head
saucily
to
one
side
and
said
as
if
you
really
cared
but
the
boy
stoutly
maintained
his
position
and
it
was
that
perhaps
which
made
her
play
the
little
joke
one
day
the
boy
was
fourteen
that
summer
and
the
girl
thirteen
they
had
begun
their
signals
years
before
but
they
had
not
had
the
black
one
so
long
on
this
day
that
i
tell
you
of
the
girl
waved
three
waves
which
meant
day
you
remember
and
watched
until
the
boy
had
hoisted
his
black
flag
which
said
in
response
then
as
fast
as
her
mischievous
little
feet
could
carry
her
she
raced
down
one
hill
and
across
to
the
other
very
stealthily
she
advanced
till
she
found
the
boy
bent
over
a
puzzle
on
the
back
stoop
and
and
he
was
whistling
merrily
how
she
teased
him
then
how
she
taunted
him
with
indeed
and
whistling
like
that
in
vain
he
blushed
and
stammered
and
protested
that
his
whistling
was
only
to
keep
up
his
spirits
the
girl
only
laughed
and
tossed
her
yellow
curls
then
she
hunted
till
she
found
some
little
jingling
bells
and
these
she
tied
to
the
black
badge
of
mourning
and
pulled
it
high
up
on
the
flagpole
the
next
instant
she
was
off
with
a
run
and
a
skip
and
a
saucy
wave
of
her
hand
and
the
boy
was
left
all
alone
with
an
hour
work
ahead
of
him
to
untie
the
knots
from
his
desecrated
badge
of
mourning
and
yet
they
were
wonderfully
good
friends
this
boy
and
girl
from
the
very
first
when
they
were
seven
and
eight
they
had
said
that
they
would
marry
each
other
when
they
grew
up
and
always
they
spoke
of
it
as
the
expected
thing
and
laid
many
happy
plans
for
the
time
when
it
should
come
to
be
sure
as
they
grew
older
it
was
not
mentioned
quite
so
often
perhaps
but
the
boy
at
least
thought
if
he
thought
of
it
all
that
that
was
only
because
it
was
already
so
well
understood
what
did
the
girl
think
it
was
jill
who
asked
the
question
eh
the
girl
oh
answered
jack
a
little
bitterly
i
afraid
i
do
know
exactly
what
the
girl
did
think
but
it
was
that
anyhow
that
is
judging
from
what
followed
what
did
follow
well
to
begin
with
the
old
aunt
died
the
girl
was
sixteen
then
it
was
in
the
winter
that
this
happened
and
the
girl
was
far
away
at
school
she
came
to
the
funeral
however
but
the
boy
did
not
see
her
save
in
the
distance
and
then
he
hardly
knew
her
so
strange
did
she
look
in
her
black
dress
and
hat
she
was
there
only
two
days
and
though
he
gazed
wistfully
up
at
the
gray
tower
he
knew
well
enough
that
of
course
she
could
not
wave
to
him
at
such
a
time
as
that
yet
he
had
hoped
almost
believed
that
she
would
wave
two
waves
that
last
day
and
let
him
go
over
to
see
her
but
she
did
wave
and
he
did
go
over
she
went
away
and
then
the
town
learned
a
wonderful
thing
the
old
lady
her
aunt
who
had
been
considered
just
fairly
rich
turned
out
to
be
the
possessor
of
almost
fabulous
wealth
owing
to
her
great
holdings
of
stock
in
a
western
gold
mine
which
had
suddenly
struck
it
rich
and
to
the
girl
she
willed
it
all
it
was
then
of
course
that
the
girl
became
the
princess
but
the
boy
did
not
realize
that
just
then
to
him
she
was
still
girl
for
three
years
he
did
not
see
her
she
was
at
school
or
traveling
abroad
he
heard
he
too
had
been
away
to
school
and
was
indeed
just
ready
to
enter
college
then
that
summer
he
heard
that
she
was
coming
to
the
old
home
and
his
heart
sang
within
him
remember
to
him
she
was
still
the
girl
he
knew
of
course
that
she
was
not
the
little
girl
who
had
promised
to
marry
him
but
he
was
sure
she
was
the
merry
comrade
the
young
girl
who
used
to
smile
frankly
into
his
eyes
and
whom
he
was
now
to
win
for
his
wife
you
see
he
had
forgotten
quite
forgotten
about
the
princess
and
the
money
such
a
foolish
foolish
boy
as
he
was
so
he
got
out
his
flags
gleefully
and
one
day
when
his
mother
in
the
kitchen
he
ironed
out
the
wrinkles
and
smoothed
them
all
ready
to
be
raised
on
the
pole
he
would
be
ready
when
the
girl
waved
for
of
course
she
would
wave
he
would
show
her
that
he
had
not
forgotten
he
could
see
just
how
the
sparkle
would
come
to
her
eyes
and
just
how
the
little
fine
lines
of
mischief
would
crinkle
around
her
nose
when
she
was
ready
to
give
that
first
wave
he
could
imagine
that
she
would
like
to
find
him
napping
that
she
would
like
to
take
him
by
surprise
and
make
him
scurry
around
for
his
flags
to
answer
her
but
he
would
show
her
as
if
she
a
girl
were
to
beat
him
at
their
old
game
he
wondered
which
it
would
be
coming
over
or
are
to
come
over
here
whichever
it
was
he
would
answer
of
course
with
the
red
right
still
it
would
be
a
joke
to
run
up
the
blue
to
work
and
then
slip
across
to
see
her
just
as
she
so
long
ago
had
played
the
joke
on
him
on
the
whole
however
he
thought
the
red
flag
would
be
better
and
it
was
that
one
which
he
laid
uppermost
ready
to
his
hand
when
he
arranged
them
at
last
she
came
he
heard
of
it
at
once
it
was
already
past
four
but
he
could
not
forbear
even
then
to
look
toward
the
tower
it
would
be
like
her
after
all
to
wave
then
that
very
night
just
so
as
to
catch
him
napping
he
thought
she
did
not
wave
however
the
boy
was
sure
of
that
for
he
watched
the
tower
till
dark
in
the
morning
long
before
eight
the
boy
was
ready
he
debated
for
some
time
whether
to
stand
out
of
doors
on
the
piazza
or
to
hide
behind
the
screened
window
where
he
could
still
watch
the
tower
he
decided
at
last
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
let
her
see
him
when
she
looked
toward
the
house
then
his
triumph
would
be
all
the
more
complete
when
he
dashed
out
to
run
up
his
answer
eight
came
and
passed
the
boy
waited
until
nine
but
there
was
no
sign
of
life
from
the
tower
the
boy
was
angry
then
at
himself
he
called
himself
indeed
a
fool
to
hide
as
he
did
of
course
she
would
wave
when
he
was
nowhere
in
sight
when
he
had
apparently
forgotten
and
here
was
a
whole
precious
day
wasted
the
next
morning
long
before
eight
the
boy
stood
in
plain
sight
on
the
piazza
as
before
he
waited
until
nine
and
as
before
there
was
no
sign
of
life
at
the
tower
window
the
next
morning
he
was
there
again
and
the
next
and
the
next
it
took
just
five
days
indeed
to
convince
the
boy
as
he
was
convinced
at
last
that
the
girl
did
not
intend
to
wave
at
all
but
how
unkind
of
her
exclaimed
david
she
could
have
been
nice
one
bit
decided
jill
you
forget
said
jack
she
was
the
princess
huh
grunted
jill
and
david
in
unison
the
boy
remembered
it
then
went
on
jack
after
a
pause
about
the
money
and
that
she
was
a
princess
and
of
course
he
knew
when
he
thought
of
it
that
he
could
not
expect
that
a
princess
would
wave
like
a
girl
just
a
girl
besides
very
likely
she
did
not
care
particularly
about
seeing
him
princesses
did
forget
he
fancied
they
had
so
much
so
very
much
to
fill
their
lives
it
was
this
thought
that
kept
him
from
going
to
see
her
this
and
the
recollection
that
after
all
if
she
really
had
wanted
to
see
him
she
could
have
waved
there
came
a
day
however
when
another
youth
who
did
not
dare
to
go
alone
persuaded
him
and
together
they
paid
her
a
call
the
boy
understood
then
many
things
he
found
the
princess
there
was
no
sign
of
the
girl
the
princess
was
tall
and
dignified
with
a
cold
little
hand
and
a
smooth
sweet
voice
there
was
no
frank
smile
in
her
eyes
neither
were
there
any
mischievous
crinkles
about
her
nose
and
lips
there
was
no
mention
of
towers
or
flags
no
reference
to
wavings
or
to
childhood
days
there
was
only
a
stiffly
polite
little
conversation
about
colleges
and
travels
with
a
word
or
two
about
books
and
plays
then
the
callers
went
home
on
the
way
the
boy
smiled
scornfully
to
himself
he
was
trying
to
picture
the
beauteous
vision
he
had
seen
this
unapproachable
princess
in
her
filmy
lace
gown
standing
in
the
tower
window
and
waving
waving
to
a
bit
of
a
house
on
the
opposite
hill
as
if
that
could
happen
the
boy
during
those
last
three
years
had
known
only
books
he
knew
little
of
girls
only
one
girl
and
he
knew
still
less
of
princesses
so
when
three
days
after
the
call
there
came
a
chance
to
join
a
summer
camp
with
a
man
who
loved
books
even
better
than
did
the
boy
himself
he
went
gladly
once
he
had
refused
to
go
on
this
very
trip
but
then
there
had
been
the
girl
now
there
was
only
the
princess
and
the
princess
did
count
like
the
hours
that
are
sunshiny
interpreted
david
yes
corroborated
jack
like
the
hours
when
the
sun
does
shine
and
then
prompted
jill
well
then
there
was
much
worth
telling
rejoined
jack
gloomily
two
more
years
passed
and
the
princess
grew
to
be
she
came
into
full
control
of
her
property
then
and
after
a
while
she
came
back
to
the
old
stone
house
with
the
towers
and
turned
it
into
a
fairyland
of
beauty
she
spent
money
like
water
all
manner
of
artists
from
the
man
who
painted
her
ceilings
to
the
man
who
planted
her
seeds
came
and
bowed
to
her
will
from
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
she
brought
her
treasures
and
lavished
them
through
the
house
and
grounds
then
every
summer
she
came
herself
and
lived
among
them
a
very
princess
indeed
and
the
boy
what
became
of
the
boy
demanded
david
did
he
see
her
ever
jack
shook
his
head
not
often
david
and
when
he
did
it
did
not
make
him
any
happier
you
see
the
boy
had
become
the
pauper
you
must
forget
that
but
he
was
a
pauper
when
you
left
him
last
was
he
well
then
i
tell
you
about
that
you
see
the
boy
even
though
he
did
go
away
soon
found
out
that
in
his
heart
the
princess
was
still
the
girl
just
the
same
he
loved
her
and
he
wanted
her
to
be
his
wife
so
for
a
little
for
a
very
little
he
was
wild
enough
to
think
that
he
might
work
and
study
and
do
great
things
in
the
world
until
he
was
even
a
prince
himself
and
then
he
could
marry
the
princess
well
could
he
no
to
begin
with
he
lost
his
health
then
away
back
in
the
little
house
on
the
hill
something
happened
a
something
that
left
a
very
precious
charge
for
him
to
keep
and
he
had
to
go
back
and
keep
it
and
to
try
to
see
if
he
could
find
that
lost
health
as
well
and
that
is
all
all
you
do
mean
that
that
is
the
end
exclaimed
jill
that
the
end
but
that
is
a
mite
of
a
nice
end
complained
david
they
always
get
married
and
live
happy
ever
after
in
stories
do
they
jack
smiled
a
little
sadly
perhaps
they
do
david
in
stories
well
ca
they
in
this
one
i
do
see
how
why
ca
he
go
to
her
and
ask
her
to
marry
him
jack
drew
himself
up
proudly
the
pauper
and
the
princess
never
paupers
do
go
to
princesses
david
and
say
love
you
david
frowned
why
not
i
do
see
why
if
they
want
to
do
it
seems
as
if
somehow
it
might
be
fixed
it
ca
be
returned
jack
his
gaze
on
the
towers
that
crowned
the
opposite
hill
not
so
long
as
always
before
the
pauper
eyes
there
are
those
gray
walls
behind
which
he
pictures
the
princess
in
the
midst
of
her
golden
luxury
to
neither
david
nor
jill
did
the
change
to
the
present
tense
seem
strange
the
story
was
much
too
real
to
them
for
that
well
anyhow
i
think
it
ought
to
be
fixed
declared
david
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
so
do
i
but
we
ca
fix
it
laughed
jill
and
i
hungry
see
what
there
is
to
eat
chapter
xviii
david
to
the
rescue
it
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
but
for
once
david
was
not
thinking
of
the
moon
all
the
way
to
the
holly
farmhouse
he
was
thinking
of
jack
story
the
princess
and
the
pauper
it
held
him
strangely
he
felt
that
he
never
could
forget
it
for
some
reason
that
he
could
not
have
explained
it
made
him
sad
too
and
his
step
was
very
quiet
as
he
went
up
the
walk
toward
the
kitchen
door
it
was
after
eight
david
had
taken
supper
with
jack
and
jill
and
not
for
some
hours
had
he
been
at
the
farmhouse
in
the
doorway
now
he
stopped
short
then
instinctively
he
stepped
back
into
the
shadow
in
the
kitchen
a
kerosene
light
was
burning
it
showed
holly
crying
at
the
table
and
holly
and
staring
at
nothing
then
holly
raised
her
face
drawn
and
and
asked
a
trembling
question
simeon
have
you
thought
we
might
go
to
john
for
help
david
was
frightened
then
so
angry
was
the
look
that
came
into
simeon
holly
face
ellen
we
have
no
more
of
this
said
the
man
harshly
understand
i
rather
lose
the
whole
thing
and
and
starve
than
go
to
john
david
fled
then
up
the
back
stairs
he
crept
to
his
room
and
left
his
violin
a
moment
later
he
stole
down
again
and
sought
perry
larson
whom
he
had
seen
smoking
in
the
barn
doorway
perry
what
is
it
he
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
what
has
happened
in
there
he
pointed
toward
the
house
the
man
puffed
for
a
moment
in
silence
before
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
well
sonny
i
i
may
as
well
tell

by

explained
rummaging
his
pockets
until
he
had
found
a
silver
dollar
to
lay
on
his
open
palm
now
jest
imagine
a
thousand
of
them

and
they

when
it
old
streeter
that
got
the
mortgage
on
a
good
fat
farm
like
this
david
drew
his
brows
together
perplexedly
what
is
a
a
mortgage
he
asked
is
it
anything
like
a
i
know
what
that
is
my
lady
of
the
roses

one
but

perry
larson
sighed
in
exasperation
gosh
if
that
ai
what
i
expected
of
ye
no
it
ai
even
second
cousin
to
a
thing
you
of
in
plain
wordin
it
jest
this
holly
he
says
ter

a
thousand
dollars
and
i
pay

a
sartin
day
if

holly

sure
only
they

ter
git
out

know
where
they
go
the
lord
knows
i
do
and
is
that
what
they
crying
for
in
there
because
they
got
to
go
sure
but
is
there
anything
anywhere
that
can
be
done
to
stop
it
i
do
see
how
kid
not
unless
some
one
ponies
up
with
the
money
next
an
a
thousand
o
them
things
do
grow
on
bush
he
finished
gently
patting
the
coin
in
his
hand
at
the
words
a
swift
change
came
to
david
face
his
cheeks
paled
and
his
eyes
dilated
in
terror
it
was
as
if
ahead
of
him
he
saw
a
yawning
abyss
eager
to
engulf
him
and
you
say
money
would
fix
it
he
asked
thickly
a
thousand
o
them
though
would
take
a
dawning
relief
came
into
david
eyes
it
was
as
if
he
saw
a
bridge
across
the
abyss
you
mean
that
there
would
anything
do
only
silver
pieces
like
those
he
questioned
hopefully
sugar
kid
there
would
gosh
but
you
be
a
checkerboard
sense
an
nonsense
an
no
mistake
any
money
would
do
the
job
any
money
do
ye
see
anything
that
money
would
do
it
david
voice
was
very
faint
now
sure
gold
or
silver
or
greenbacks
or
or
a
check
if
it
had
the
dough
behind
it
david
did
not
appear
to
hear
the
last
with
an
oddly
strained
look
he
had
hung
upon
the
man
first
words
but
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
he
only
murmured
oh
thank
you
and
turned
away
he
was
walking
slowly
now
toward
the
house
his
head
was
bowed
his
step
lagged
now
ai
that
jest
like
that
chap
muttered
the
man
ter
slink
off
like
that
as
if
he
was
a
whipped
cur
i
bet
two
cents
an
a
doughnut
too
that
in
five
minutes
he
be
what
he
calls
on
that
fiddle
o
his
an
i
be
derned
too
if
i
ai
curious
ter
see
what
he
will
make
of
it
it
strikes
me
this
ought
ter
fetch
somethin
first
cousin
to
a
dirge
on
the
porch
steps
david
paused
a
breathless
instant
from
the
kitchen
came
the
sound
of
holly
sobs
and
of
a
stern
voice
praying
with
a
shudder
and
a
little
choking
cry
the
boy
turned
then
and
crept
softly
upstairs
to
his
room
he
played
too
as
perry
larson
had
wagered
but
it
was
not
the
tragedy
of
the
closed
bank
nor
the
honor
of
the
threatened
that
fell
from
his
violin
it
was
instead
the
swan
song
of
a
little
pile
of
gold
gold
which
lay
now
in
a
chimney
cupboard
but
which
was
soon
to
be
placed
at
the
feet
of
the
mourning
man
and
woman
downstairs
and
in
the
song
was
the
sob
of
a
boy
who
sees
his
house
of
dreams
burn
to
ashes
who
sees
his
wonderful
life
and
work
out
in
the
wide
world
turn
to
endless
days
of
and
in
a
narrow
valley
there
was
in
the
song
too
something
of
the
struggle
the
fierce
yea
and
nay
of
the
conflict
but
at
the
end
there
was
the
wild
burst
of
exaltation
of
renunciation
so
that
the
man
in
the
barn
door
below
fairly
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
angry
gosh
if
he
hai
turned
the
thing
into
a
jig
durn
him
do
he
know
that
at
such
a
time
as
this
later
a
very
little
later
the
shadowy
figure
of
the
boy
stood
before
him
i
been
thinking
stammered
david
that
maybe
i
could
help
about
that
money
you
know
now
look
boy
exploded
perry
in
open
exasperation
as
i
said
in
the
first
place
this
ai
in
your
class
ai
no
pink
cloud
sailin
in
the
sky
nor
a
bluebird
singin
in
a
bush
an
you
might
it
as
you
call
it
till
doomsday
an
do
no
good
though
i
free
ter
confess
that
your
playin
of
them
other
things
sounds
real
pert
an
chirky
at
times
but
wo
do
no
good
here
david
stepped
forward
bringing
his
small
anxious
face
full
into
the
moonlight
but
was
the
money
perry
i
meant
about
the
money
he
explained
they
were
good
to
me
and
wanted
me
when
there
was
any
one
else
that
did
and
now
i
like
to
do
something
for
them
there
are
so
many
pieces
and
they
are
silver
there
only
one
hundred
and
six
of
them
i
counted
but
maybe
they
help
some
it
it
would
be
a
start
his
voice
broke
over
the
once
beloved
word
then
went
on
with
renewed
strength
there
see
would
these
do
and
with
both
hands
he
held
up
to
view
his
cap
sagging
under
its
weight
of
gold
perry
larson
jaw
fell
open
his
eyes
bulged
dazedly
he
reached
out
and
touched
with
trembling
fingers
the
heap
of
shining
disks
that
seemed
in
the
mellow
light
like
little
children
of
the
moon
itself
the
next
instant
he
recoiled
sharply
great
snakes
boy
where
you
git
that
money
he
demanded
of
father
he
went
to
the
far
country
you
know
perry
larson
snorted
angrily
see
here
boy
for
once
if
ye
can
talk
surely
even
you
do
expect
me
ter
believe
that
he
sent
you
that
money
from
from
where
he
gone
to
oh
no
he
left
it
left
it
why
boy
you
know
better
there
a
cent
hardly
found
on
him
he
gave
it
to
me
before
by
the
roadside
gave
it
to
you
where
in
the
name
of
goodness
has
it
been
since
in
the
little
cupboard
in
my
room
behind
the
books
great
snakes
muttered
perry
larson
reaching
out
his
hand
and
gingerly
picking
up
one
of
the
david
eyed
him
anxiously
wo
they
do
he
faltered
there
are
a
thousand
there
only
a
hundred
and
six
but
do
cut
in
the
man
excitedly
he
had
been
examining
the
at
close
range
do
well
i
reckon
they
do
by
jiminy
and
ter
think
you
had
this
up
yer
sleeve
all
this
time
well
i
believe
anythin
of
yer
now
anythin
you
ca
stump
me
with
nuthin
come
on
and
he
hurriedly
led
the
way
toward
the
house
but
they
were
up
my
sleeve
corrected
david
as
he
tried
to
keep
up
with
the
long
strides
of
the
man
i
said
they
were
in
the
cupboard
in
my
room
there
was
no
answer
larson
had
reached
the
porch
steps
and
had
paused
there
hesitatingly
from
the
kitchen
still
came
the
sound
of
sobs
aside
from
that
there
was
silence
the
boy
however
did
not
hesitate
he
went
straight
up
the
steps
and
through
the
open
kitchen
door
at
the
table
sat
the
man
and
the
woman
their
eyes
covered
with
their
hands
with
a
swift
overturning
of
his
cap
david
dumped
his
burden
onto
the
table
and
stepped
back
respectfully
if
you
please
sir
would
this
help
any
he
asked
at
the
jingle
of
the
coins
simeon
holly
and
his
wife
lifted
their
heads
abruptly
a
sob
died
on
the
woman
lips
a
quick
cry
came
from
the
man
he
reached
forth
an
eager
hand
and
had
almost
clutched
the
gold
when
a
sudden
change
came
to
his
face
with
a
stern
ejaculation
he
drew
back
boy
where
did
that
money
come
from
he
challenged
david
sighed
in
a
discouraged
way
it
seemed
that
always
the
showing
of
this
gold
mea
questioning
eternal
questioning
surely
continued
simeon
holly
you
did
not
with
the
boy
frank
gaze
upturned
to
his
the
man
could
not
finish
his
sentence
before
david
could
answer
came
the
voice
of
perry
larson
from
the
kitchen
doorway
no
sir
he
did
holly
an
it
all
straight
thinkin
though
i
free
ter
confess
it
does
sound
nutty
his
dad
give
it
to
him
his
father
but
where
where
has
it
been
ever
since
in
the
chimney
cupboard
in
his
room
he
says
sir
simeon
holly
turned
in
frowning
amazement
david
what
does
this
mean
why
have
you
kept
this
gold
in
a
place
like
that
why
there
was
anything
else
to
do
with
it
answered
the
boy
perplexedly
i
had
any
use
for
it
you
know
and
father
said
to
keep
it
till
i
needed
it
any
use
for
it
blustered
larson
from
the
doorway
jiminy
now
ai
that
jest
like
that
boy
but
david
hurried
on
with
his
explanation
we
never
used
to
use
them
father
and
i
except
to
buy
things
to
eat
and
wear
and
down
here
you
give
me
those
you
know
gorry
interjected
perry
larson
do
you
reckon
boy
that
holly
himself
was
give
them
things
he
gives
ter
you
the
boy
turned
sharply
a
startled
question
in
his
eyes
what
do
you
mean
do
you
mean
that
his
face
changed
suddenly
his
cheeks
turned
a
shamed
red
why
he
did
he
did
have
to
buy
them
of
course
just
as
father
did
and
i
never
even
thought
of
it
before
then
it
yours
anyway
it
belongs
to
you
he
argued
turning
to
farmer
holly
and
shoving
the
gold
nearer
to
his
hands
there
enough
maybe
but
will
help
they
gold
pieces
sir
spoke
up
larson
importantly
an
there
a
hundred
an
six
of
them
that
jest
one
thousand
sixty
dollars
as
i
make
it
simeon
holly
man
that
he
was
almost
leaped
from
his
chair
one
thousand
and
sixty
dollars
he
gasped
then
to
david
boy
in
heaven
name
who
are
you
i
do
know
only
david
the
boy
spoke
wearily
with
a
grieved
sob
in
his
voice
he
was
very
tired
a
good
deal
perplexed
and
a
little
angry
he
wished
if
no
one
wanted
this
gold
that
he
could
take
it
upstairs
again
to
the
chimney
cupboard
or
if
they
objected
to
that
that
they
would
at
least
give
it
to
him
and
let
him
go
away
now
to
that
beautiful
music
he
was
to
hear
and
to
those
kind
people
who
were
always
to
understand
what
he
said
when
he
played
of
course
ventured
perry
larson
diffidently
i
ai
professin
ter
know
any
great
shakes
about
the
hand
of
the
lord
holly
but
it
do
strike
me
that
this
gold
comes
mighty
near
proverdential
fur
you
simeon
holly
fell
back
in
his
seat
his
eyes
clung
to
the
gold
but
his
lips
set
into
rigid
lines
that
money
is
the
boy
larson
it
is
mine
he
said
he
give
it
to
ye
simeon
holly
shook
his
head
david
is
nothing
but
a
child
perry
he
does
realize
at
all
what
he
is
doing
nor
how
valuable
his
gift
is
i
know
sir
but
you
did
take
him
in
when
there
would
nobody
else
do
it
argued
larson
an
anyhow
could
you
make
a
kind
of
an
i
o
u
of
it
even
if
he
is
a
kid
then
some
day
you
could
pay
him
back
meanwhile
you
be
him
an
him
an
somethin
i
know
i
know
nodded
simeon
holly
thoughtfully
his
eyes
going
from
the
gold
to
david
face
then
aloud
yet
as
if
to
himself
he
breathed
boy
boy
who
was
your
father
how
came
he
by
all
that
gold
and
he
a
tramp
david
drew
himself
suddenly
erect
his
eyes
flashed
i
do
know
sir
but
i
do
know
this
he
did
steal
it
across
the
table
holly
drew
a
quick
breath
but
she
did
not
speak
save
with
her
pleading
eyes
holly
seldom
spoke
save
with
her
eyes
when
her
husband
was
solving
a
knotty
problem
she
was
dumfounded
now
that
he
should
listen
so
patiently
to
the
man
larson
though
she
was
not
more
surprised
than
was
larson
himself
for
both
of
them
however
there
came
at
this
moment
a
still
greater
surprise
simeon
holly
leaned
forward
suddenly
the
stern
lines
quite
gone
from
his
lips
and
his
face
working
with
emotion
as
he
drew
david
toward
him
you
a
good
son
boy
a
good
loyal
son
and
and
i
wish
you
were
mine
i
believe
you
he
did
steal
it
and
i
wo
steal
it
either
but
i
will
use
it
since
you
are
so
good
as
to
offer
it
but
it
shall
be
a
loan
david
and
some
day
god
helping
me
you
shall
have
it
back
meanwhile
you
my
boy
david
my
boy
oh
thank
you
sir
rejoiced
david
and
really
you
know
being
wanted
like
that
is
better
than
the
start
would
be
is
it
better
than
what
david
shifted
his
position
he
had
not
meant
to
say
just
that
n
nothing
he
stammered
looking
about
for
a
means
of
quick
escape
i
i
was
just
talking
he
finished
and
he
was
immeasurably
relieved
to
find
that
holly
did
not
press
the
matter
further
chapter
xix
the
unbeautiful
world
in
spite
of
the
exaltation
of
renunciation
and
in
spite
of
the
joy
of
being
newly
and
especially
wanted
those
early
september
days
were
sometimes
hard
for
david
not
until
he
had
relinquished
all
hope
of
his
start
did
he
fully
realize
what
that
hope
had
meant
to
him
there
were
times
to
be
sure
when
there
was
nothing
but
rejoicing
within
him
that
he
was
able
thus
to
aid
the
hollys
there
were
other
times
when
there
was
nothing
but
the
sore
heartache
because
of
the
great
work
out
in
the
beautiful
world
that
could
now
never
be
done
and
because
of
the
unlovely
work
at
hand
that
must
be
done
to
tell
the
truth
indeed
david
entire
conception
of
life
had
become
suddenly
a
chaos
of
puzzling
contradictions
to
jack
one
day
david
went
with
his
perplexities
not
that
he
told
him
of
the
and
of
the
unexpected
use
to
which
they
had
been
put
indeed
no
david
had
made
up
his
mind
never
if
he
could
help
himself
to
mention
those
to
any
one
who
did
not
already
know
of
them
they
meant
questions
and
the
questions
explanations
and
he
had
had
enough
of
both
on
that
particular
subject
but
to
jack
he
said
one
day
when
they
were
alone
together
jack
how
many
folks
have
you
got
inside
of
your
head
eh
what
david
david
repeated
his
question
and
attached
an
explanation
i
mean
the
folks
that
that
make
you
do
things
jack
laughed
well
he
said
i
believe
some
people
make
claims
to
quite
a
number
and
perhaps
almost
every
one
owns
to
a
jekyll
and
a
mr
hyde
who
are
they
never
mind
david
i
do
think
you
know
the
gentlemen
anyhow
they
only
something
like
the
little
girl
with
a
curl
one
is
very
very
good
indeed
and
the
other
is
horrid
oh
yes
i
know
them
they
the
ones
that
come
to
me
returned
david
with
a
sigh
i
had
them
a
lot
lately
jack
stared
oh
have
you
yes
and
that
what
the
trouble
how
can
you
drive
them
off
the
one
that
is
bad
i
mean
well
really
confessed
jack
i
not
sure
i
can
tell
you
see
the
gentlemen
visit
me
sometimes
oh
do
they
yes
i
so
glad
that
is
i
mean
amended
david
in
answer
to
uplifted
eyebrows
i
glad
that
you
understand
what
i
talking
about
you
see
i
tried
perry
larson
last
night
on
it
to
get
him
to
tell
me
what
to
do
but
he
only
stared
and
laughed
he
did
know
the
names
of
anyhow
as
you
do
and
at
last
he
got
really
almost
angry
and
said
i
made
him
feel
so
and
that
he
would
dare
look
at
himself
in
the
glass
if
i
kept
on
for
fear
some
one
he
never
known
was
there
should
jump
out
at
him
jack
chuckled
well
i
suspect
david
that
perry
knew
one
of
your
gentlemen
by
the
name
of
perhaps
and
i
also
suspect
that
maybe
conscience
does
pretty
nearly
fill
the
bill
and
that
you
been
having
a
bout
with
that
eh
now
what
is
the
trouble
tell
me
about
it
david
stirred
uneasily
instead
of
answering
he
asked
another
question
jack
it
is
a
beautiful
world
is
it
for
a
moment
there
was
no
answer
then
a
low
voice
replied
your
father
said
it
was
david
again
david
moved
restlessly
yes
but
father
was
on
the
mountain
and
down
here
well
down
here
there
are
lots
of
things
that
i
do
believe
he
knew
about
what
for
instance
why
lots
of
things
too
many
to
tell
of
course
there
are
things
like
catching
fish
and
killing
birds
and
squirrels
and
other
things
to
eat
and
plaguing
cats
and
dogs
father
never
would
have
called
those
beautiful
then
there
are
others
like
little
jimmy
clark
who
walk
and
the
man
at
the
marstons
who
sick
and
joe
glaspell
who
is
blind
then
there
are
still
different
ones
like
holly
little
boy
perry
says
he
ran
away
years
and
years
ago
and
made
his
people
very
unhappy
father
would
call
that
a
beautiful
world
would
he
and
how
can
people
like
that
always
play
in
tune
and
there
are
the
princess
and
the
pauper
that
you
told
about
oh
the
story
yes
and
people
like
them
ca
be
happy
and
think
the
world
is
beautiful
of
course
why
not
because
they
did
end
right
they
did
get
married
and
live
happy
ever
after
you
know
well
i
do
think
i
worry
about
that
david
at
least
not
about
the
princess
i
fancy
the
world
was
very
beautiful
to
her
all
right
the
pauper
well
perhaps
he
was
very
happy
but
after
all
david
you
know
happiness
is
something
inside
of
yourself
perhaps
half
of
these
people
are
happy
in
their
way
there
and
that
another
thing
sighed
david
you
see
i
found
that
out
that
it
was
inside
of
yourself
quite
a
while
ago
and
i
told
the
lady
of
the
roses
but
now
i
ca
make
it
work
myself
what
the
matter
well
you
see
then
something
was
going
to
happen
something
that
i
liked
and
i
found
that
just
thinking
of
it
made
it
so
that
i
mind
raking
or
hoeing
or
anything
like
that
and
i
told
the
lady
of
the
roses
and
i
told
her
that
even
if
it
was
going
to
happen
she
could
think
it
was
going
to
and
that
that
would
be
just
the
same
because
was
the
thinking
that
made
my
hours
sunny
ones
it
the
doing
at
all
i
said
i
knew
because
i
had
done
it
yet
see
i
think
so
david
well
i
found
out
that
it
is
the
same
at
all
for
now
that
i
know
that
this
beautiful
thing
is
ever
going
to
happen
to
me
i
can
think
and
think
all
day
and
it
does
do
a
mite
of
good
the
sun
is
just
as
hot
and
my
back
aches
just
as
hard
and
the
field
is
just
as
big
and
endless
as
it
used
to
be
when
i
had
to
call
it
that
those
hours
did
count
now
what
is
the
matter
jack
laughed
but
he
shook
his
head
a
little
sadly
you
getting
into
too
deep
waters
for
me
david
i
suspect
floundering
in
a
sea
that
has
upset
the
boats
of
sages
since
the
world
began
but
what
is
it
that
was
so
nice
and
that
is
going
to
happen
perhaps
i
might
help
on
that
no
you
could
frowned
david
and
there
could
anybody
either
you
see
because
i
would
go
back
now
and
let
it
happen
anyhow
as
long
as
i
know
what
i
do
why
if
i
did
there
would
be
any
hours
that
were
sunny
then
not
even
the
ones
after
four
i
i
feel
so
mean
but
what
i
do
see
is
just
how
i
can
fix
it
up
with
the
lady
of
the
roses
what
has
she
to
do
with
it
why
at
the
very
first
when
she
said
she
did
have
any
sunshiny
hours
i
told
her
when
she
said
what
interposed
jack
coming
suddenly
erect
in
his
chair
that
she
did
have
any
hours
to
count
you
know
to
count
yes
it
was
the
sundial
did
i
tell
you
yes
i
know
i
did
about
the
words
on
it
not
counting
any
hours
that
were
sunny
you
know
and
she
said
she
would
have
any
hours
to
count
that
the
sun
never
shone
for
her
why
david
demurred
jack
in
a
voice
that
shook
a
little
are
you
sure
did
she
say
just
that
you
you
must
be
mistaken
when
she
has
has
everything
to
make
her
happy
i
was
because
i
said
that
same
thing
to
her
myself
afterwards
and
then
i
told
her
when
i
found
out
myself
you
know
about
its
being
what
was
inside
of
you
after
all
that
counted
and
then
is
when
i
asked
her
if
she
could
think
of
something
nice
that
was
going
to
happen
to
her
sometime
well
what
did
she
say
she
shook
her
head
and
said
then
she
looked
away
and
her
eyes
got
soft
and
dark
like
little
pools
in
the
brook
where
the
water
stops
to
rest
and
she
said
she
had
hoped
once
that
this
something
would
happen
but
that
it
had
and
that
it
would
take
something
more
than
thinking
to
bring
it
and
i
know
now
what
she
meant
because
thinking
is
all
that
counts
is
it
jack
did
not
answer
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
pacing
restlessly
up
and
down
the
veranda
once
or
twice
he
turned
his
eyes
toward
the
towers
of
sunnycrest
and
david
noticed
that
there
was
a
new
look
on
his
face
very
soon
however
the
old
tiredness
came
back
to
his
eyes
and
he
dropped
into
his
seat
again
muttering
fool
of
course
it
be
that
be
what
asked
david
jack
started
er
nothing
nothing
that
you
would
understand
david
go
on
with
what
you
were
saying
there
is
any
more
it
all
done
it
only
that
i
wondering
how
i
going
to
learn
here
that
it
a
beautiful
world
so
that
i
can
tell
father
jack
roused
himself
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
determinedly
throws
to
one
side
a
heavy
burden
well
david
he
smiled
as
i
said
before
you
are
still
out
on
that
sea
where
there
are
so
many
little
upturned
boats
there
might
be
a
good
many
ways
of
answering
that
question
holly
says
mused
the
boy
aloud
a
little
gloomily
that
it
does
make
any
difference
whether
we
find
things
beautiful
or
not
that
we
here
to
do
something
serious
in
the
world
that
is
about
what
i
should
have
expected
of
holly
retorted
jack
grimly
he
acts
it
and
looks
it
but
i
do
believe
you
are
going
to
tell
your
father
just
that
no
sir
i
do
believe
i
am
accorded
david
soberly
i
have
an
idea
that
you
going
to
find
that
answer
just
where
your
father
said
you
would
in
your
violin
see
if
you
do
things
that
are
beautiful
you
make
beautiful
because
we
find
what
we
are
looking
for
and
you
looking
for
beautiful
things
after
all
boy
if
we
march
straight
ahead
chin
up
and
sing
our
own
little
song
with
all
our
might
and
main
we
sha
come
so
far
amiss
from
the
goal
thinking
there
that
preaching
and
i
did
mean
to
preach
but
well
to
tell
the
truth
that
was
meant
for
myself
for
hunting
for
the
beautiful
world
too
yes
sir
i
know
returned
david
fervently
and
again
jack
looking
into
the
sympathetic
glowing
dark
eyes
wondered
if
after
all
david
really
could
know
even
yet
jack
was
not
used
to
david
there
were
so
many
of
him
he
told
himself
there
were
the
boy
the
artist
and
a
third
personality
so
evanescent
that
it
defied
being
named
the
boy
was
jolly
impetuous
confidential
and
delightful
plainly
reveling
in
all
manner
of
fun
and
frolic
the
artist
was
nothing
but
a
bunch
of
nervous
alertness
ready
to
find
melody
and
rhythm
in
every
passing
thought
or
flying
cloud
the
third
that
baffling
third
that
defied
the
naming
was
a
dreamy
visionary
untouchable
creature
who
floated
so
far
above
one
head
that
one
hand
could
never
pull
him
down
to
get
a
good
square
chance
to
see
what
he
did
look
like
all
this
thought
jack
as
he
gazed
into
david
luminous
eyes
chapter
xx
the
unfamiliar
way
in
september
david
entered
the
village
school
school
and
david
did
not
assimilate
at
once
very
confidently
the
teacher
set
to
work
to
grade
her
new
pupil
but
she
was
not
so
confident
when
she
found
that
while
in
latin
he
was
perilously
near
herself
and
in
french
which
she
was
not
required
to
teach
disastrously
beyond
her
in
united
states
history
he
knew
only
the
barest
outlines
of
certain
portions
and
could
not
name
a
single
battle
in
any
of
its
wars
in
most
studies
he
was
far
beyond
boys
of
his
own
age
yet
at
every
turn
she
encountered
these
puzzling
spots
of
discrepancy
which
rendered
grading
in
the
ordinary
way
out
of
the
question
david
methods
of
recitation
too
were
peculiar
and
somewhat
disconcerting
he
also
did
not
hesitate
to
speak
aloud
when
he
chose
nor
to
rise
from
his
seat
and
move
to
any
part
of
the
room
as
the
whim
seized
him
in
time
of
course
all
this
was
changed
but
it
was
several
days
before
the
boy
learned
so
to
conduct
himself
that
he
did
not
shatter
to
atoms
the
peace
and
propriety
of
the
schoolroom
outside
of
school
david
had
little
work
to
do
now
though
there
were
still
left
a
few
light
tasks
about
the
house
home
life
at
the
holly
farmhouse
was
the
same
for
david
yet
with
a
difference
the
difference
that
comes
from
being
really
wanted
instead
of
being
merely
dutifully
kept
there
were
other
differences
too
subtle
differences
that
did
not
show
perhaps
but
that
still
were
there
and
holly
more
than
ever
now
were
learning
to
look
at
the
world
through
david
eyes
one
day
one
wonderful
day
they
even
went
to
walk
in
the
woods
with
the
boy
and
whenever
before
had
simeon
holly
left
his
work
for
so
frivolous
a
thing
as
a
walk
in
the
woods
it
was
not
accomplished
however
without
a
struggle
as
david
could
have
told
the
day
was
a
saturday
clear
crisp
and
beautiful
with
a
promise
of
october
in
the
air
and
david
fairly
tingled
to
be
free
and
away
holly
was
baking
and
the
birds
sang
unheard
outside
her
pantry
window
holly
was
digging
potatoes
and
the
clouds
sailed
unnoticed
above
his
head
all
the
morning
david
urged
and
begged
if
for
once
just
this
once
they
would
leave
everything
and
come
they
would
not
regret
it
he
was
sure
but
they
shook
their
heads
and
said
no
no
impossible
in
the
afternoon
the
pies
were
done
and
the
potatoes
dug
and
david
urged
and
pleaded
again
if
once
only
this
once
they
would
go
to
walk
with
him
in
the
woods
he
would
be
so
happy
so
very
happy
and
to
please
the
boy
they
went
it
was
a
curious
walk
ellen
holly
trod
softly
with
timid
feet
she
threw
hurried
frightened
glances
from
side
to
side
it
was
plain
that
ellen
holly
did
not
know
how
to
play
simeon
holly
stalked
at
her
elbow
stern
silent
and
preoccupied
it
was
plain
that
simeon
holly
not
only
did
not
know
how
to
play
but
did
not
even
care
to
find
out
the
boy
tripped
ahead
and
talked
he
had
the
air
of
a
monarch
displaying
his
kingdom
on
one
side
was
a
bit
of
moss
worthy
of
the
closest
attention
on
another
a
vine
that
carried
allurement
in
every
tendril
here
was
a
flower
that
was
like
a
story
for
interest
and
there
was
a
bush
that
bore
a
secret
worth
the
telling
even
simeon
holly
glowed
into
a
semblance
of
life
when
david
had
unerringly
picked
out
and
called
by
name
the
spruce
and
fir
and
pine
and
larch
and
then
in
answer
to
holly
murmured
but
david
where
the
difference
they
look
so
much
alike
he
had
said
oh
but
they
are
you
know
just
see
how
much
more
pointed
at
the
top
that
fir
is
than
that
spruce
back
there
and
the
branches
grow
straight
out
too
like
arms
and
they
all
smooth
and
tapering
at
the
ends
like
a
tail
but
the
spruce
back
there
its
branches
turned
down
and
out
did
you
notice
and
they
all
bushy
at
the
ends
like
a
squirrel
tail
oh
they
lots
different
a
larch
ahead
that
one
with
the
branches
all
scraggly
and
close
down
to
the
ground
i
could
start
to
climb
that
easy
but
i
that
pine
over
there
see
it
up
up
before
there
a
place
for
your
foot
but
i
love
pines
up
there
on
the
mountains
where
i
lived
the
pines
were
so
tall
that
it
seemed
as
if
god
used
them
sometimes
to
hold
up
the
sky
and
simeon
holly
heard
and
said
nothing
and
that
he
did
say
nothing
especially
nothing
in
answer
to
david
confident
assertions
concerning
celestial
and
terrestrial
architecture
only
goes
to
show
how
well
indeed
the
man
was
learning
to
look
at
the
world
through
david
eyes
nor
were
these
all
of
david
friends
to
whom
and
holly
were
introduced
on
that
memorable
walk
there
were
the
birds
and
the
squirrels
and
in
fact
everything
that
had
life
and
each
one
he
greeted
joyously
by
name
as
he
would
greet
a
friend
whose
home
and
habits
he
knew
here
was
a
wonderful
woodpecker
there
was
a
beautiful
bluejay
ahead
that
brilliant
bit
of
color
that
flashed
across
their
path
was
a
tanager
once
far
up
in
the
sky
as
they
crossed
an
open
space
david
spied
a
long
black
streak
moving
southward
oh
see
he
exclaimed
the
crows
see
them
up
there
it
be
fun
if
we
could
do
that
and
fly
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
miles
maybe
a
thousand
oh
david
remonstrated
holly
unbelievingly
but
they
do
these
look
as
if
they
started
on
their
winter
journey
south
too
but
if
they
have
they
early
most
of
them
do
go
till
october
they
come
back
in
march
you
know
though
i
had
them
on
the
mountain
that
stayed
all
the
year
with
me
my
but
i
love
to
watch
them
go
murmured
david
his
eyes
following
the
rapidly
disappearing
blackline
lots
of
birds
you
ca
see
you
know
when
they
start
for
the
south
they
fly
at
night
the
woodpeckers
and
orioles
and
cuckoos
and
lots
of
others
they
afraid
i
guess
do
you
but
i
seen
them
i
watched
them
they
tell
each
other
when
they
going
to
start
oh
david
remonstrated
holly
again
her
eyes
reproving
but
plainly
enthralled
but
they
do
tell
each
other
claimed
the
boy
with
sparkling
eyes
they
must
for
all
of
a
sudden
some
night
you
hear
the
signal
and
then
they
begin
to
gather
from
all
directions
i
seen
them
then
suddenly
they
all
up
and
off
to
the
south
not
in
one
big
flock
but
broken
up
into
little
flocks
following
one
after
another
with
such
a
beautiful
whir
of
wings
oof
oof
oof
and
they
gone
and
i
do
see
them
again
till
next
year
but
you
seen
the
swallows
have
you
they
go
in
the
daytime
and
they
the
easiest
to
tell
of
any
of
them
they
fly
so
swift
and
straight
have
you
seen
the
swallows
go
why
i
i
do
know
david
murmured
holly
with
a
helpless
glance
at
her
husband
stalking
on
ahead
i
i
did
know
there
were
such
things
to
to
know
there
was
more
much
more
that
david
said
before
the
walk
came
to
an
end
and
though
when
it
did
end
neither
simeon
holly
nor
his
wife
said
a
word
of
its
having
been
a
pleasure
or
a
profit
there
was
yet
on
their
faces
something
of
the
peace
and
rest
and
quietness
that
belonged
to
the
woods
they
had
left
it
was
a
beautiful
month
that
september
and
david
made
the
most
of
it
out
of
school
meant
out
of
doors
for
him
he
saw
jack
and
jill
often
he
spent
much
time
too
with
the
lady
of
the
roses
she
was
still
the
lady
of
the
roses
to
david
though
in
the
garden
now
were
the
purple
and
scarlet
and
yellow
of
the
asters
salvia
and
golden
glow
instead
of
the
blush
and
perfume
of
the
roses
david
was
very
much
at
home
at
sunnycrest
he
was
welcome
he
knew
to
go
where
he
pleased
even
the
servants
were
kind
to
him
as
well
as
was
the
elderly
cousin
whom
he
seldom
saw
but
who
he
knew
lived
there
as
company
for
his
lady
of
the
roses
perhaps
best
next
to
the
garden
david
loved
the
tower
room
possibly
because
miss
holbrook
herself
so
often
suggested
that
they
go
there
and
it
was
there
that
they
were
when
he
said
dreamily
one
day
i
like
this
place
up
here
so
high
only
sometimes
it
does
make
me
think
of
that
princess
because
it
was
in
a
tower
like
this
that
she
was
you
know
fairy
stories
david
asked
miss
holbrook
lightly
no
not
exactly
though
there
was
a
princess
in
it
jack
told
it
david
eyes
were
still
out
of
the
window
oh
jack
and
does
jack
often
tell
you
stories
no
he
never
told
only
this
one
and
maybe
that
why
i
remember
it
so
well
and
what
did
the
princess
do
miss
holbrook
voice
was
still
light
still
carelessly
preoccupied
her
attention
plainly
was
given
to
the
sewing
in
her
hand
she
did
do
and
that
what
was
the
trouble
sighed
i
david
she
did
wave
you
know
the
needle
in
miss
holbrook
fingers
stopped
short
in
the
thread
did
wave
she
stammered
what
do
you
mean
nothing
laughed
the
boy
turning
away
from
the
window
i
forgot
that
you
did
know
the
story
but
maybe
i
do
that
is
what
was
the
story
asked
miss
holbrook
wetting
her
lips
as
if
they
had
grown
suddenly
very
dry
oh
do
you
i
wonder
now
it
was
prince
and
the
pauper
but
the
princess
and
the
pauper
cited
david
and
they
used
to
wave
signals
and
answer
with
flags
do
you
know
the
story
there
was
no
answer
miss
holbrook
was
putting
away
her
work
hurriedly
and
with
hands
that
shook
david
noticed
that
she
even
pricked
herself
in
her
anxiety
to
get
the
needle
tucked
away
then
she
drew
him
to
a
low
stool
at
her
side
david
i
want
you
to
tell
me
that
story
please
she
said
just
as
jack
told
it
to
you
now
be
careful
and
put
it
all
in
because
i
i
want
to
hear
it
she
finished
with
an
odd
little
laugh
that
seemed
to
bring
two
bright
red
spots
to
her
cheeks
oh
do
you
want
to
hear
it
then
i
will
tell
it
cried
david
joyfully
to
david
almost
as
delightful
as
to
hear
a
story
was
to
tell
one
himself
you
see
first
and
he
plunged
headlong
into
the
introduction
david
knew
it
well
that
story
and
there
was
perhaps
little
that
he
forgot
it
might
not
have
been
always
told
in
jack
language
but
his
meaning
was
there
and
very
intently
miss
holbrook
listened
while
david
told
of
the
boy
and
the
girl
the
wavings
and
the
flags
that
were
blue
black
and
red
she
laughed
once
that
was
at
the
little
joke
with
the
bells
that
the
girl
played
but
she
did
not
speak
until
sometime
later
when
david
was
telling
of
the
first
of
the
princess
and
of
the
time
when
the
boy
on
his
tiny
piazza
watched
and
watched
in
vain
for
a
waving
white
signal
from
the
tower
do
you
mean
to
say
interposed
miss
holbrook
then
almost
starting
to
her
feet
that
that
boy
expected
she
stopped
suddenly
and
fell
back
in
her
chair
the
two
red
spots
on
her
cheeks
had
become
a
rosy
glow
now
all
over
her
face
expected
what
asked
david
n
nothing
go
on
i
was
so
so
interested
explained
miss
holbrook
faintly
go
on
and
david
did
go
on
nor
did
the
story
lose
by
his
telling
it
gained
indeed
something
for
now
it
had
woven
through
it
the
very
strong
sympathy
of
a
boy
who
loved
the
pauper
for
his
sorrow
and
hated
the
princess
for
causing
that
sorrow
and
so
he
concluded
mournfully
you
see
it
is
a
very
nice
story
after
all
for
it
did
end
well
a
bit
they
ought
to
have
got
married
and
lived
happy
ever
after
but
they
did
miss
holbrook
drew
in
her
breath
a
little
uncertainly
and
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
her
face
now
instead
of
being
red
was
very
white
but
david
she
faltered
after
a
moment
perhaps
he
the
pauper
did
not
not
love
the
princess
any
longer
jack
said
that
he
did
the
white
face
went
suddenly
pink
again
then
why
did
he
go
to
her
and
and
tell
her
david
lifted
his
chin
with
all
his
dignity
he
answered
and
his
words
and
accent
were
jack
paupers
do
go
to
princesses
and
say
love
you
but
perhaps
if
they
did
that
is
if
miss
holbrook
bit
her
lips
and
did
not
finish
her
sentence
she
did
not
indeed
say
anything
more
for
a
long
time
but
she
had
not
forgotten
the
story
david
knew
that
because
later
she
began
to
question
him
carefully
about
many
little
points
points
that
he
was
very
sure
he
had
already
made
quite
plain
she
talked
about
it
indeed
until
he
wondered
if
perhaps
she
were
going
to
tell
it
to
some
one
else
sometime
he
asked
her
if
she
were
but
she
only
shook
her
head
and
after
that
she
did
not
question
him
any
more
and
a
little
later
david
went
home
chapter
xxi
heavy
hearts
for
a
week
david
had
not
been
near
the
house
that
jack
built
and
that
too
when
jill
had
been
confined
within
doors
for
several
days
with
a
cold
jill
indeed
was
inclined
to
be
grieved
at
this
apparent
lack
of
interest
on
the
part
of
her
favorite
playfellow
but
upon
her
return
from
her
first
day
of
school
after
her
recovery
she
met
her
brother
with
startled
eyes
jack
it
has
been
david
fault
at
all
she
cried
remorsefully
he
sick
sick
yes
awfully
sick
they
had
to
send
away
for
doctors
and
everything
why
jill
are
you
sure
where
did
you
hear
this
at
school
every
one
was
talking
about
it
but
what
is
the
matter
fever
some
sort
some
say
it
typhoid
and
some
scarlet
and
some
say
another
kind
that
i
ca
remember
but
everybody
says
he
awfully
sick
he
got
it
down
to
glaspell
some
say
and
some
say
he
did
but
anyhow
betty
glaspell
has
been
sick
with
something
and
they
have
let
folks
in
there
this
week
finished
jill
her
eyes
big
with
terror
the
glaspells
but
what
was
david
doing
down
there
why
you
know
he
told
us
once
teaching
joe
to
play
he
been
there
lots
joe
is
blind
you
know
and
ca
see
but
he
just
loves
music
and
was
crazy
over
david
violin
so
david
took
down
his
other
one
the
one
that
was
his
father
you
know
and
showed
him
how
to
pick
out
little
tunes
just
to
take
up
his
time
so
he
would
mind
so
much
that
he
could
see
now
jack
was
that
just
like
david
jack
i
ca
have
anything
happen
to
david
no
dear
no
of
course
not
i
afraid
we
ca
any
of
us
for
that
matter
sighed
jack
his
forehead
drawn
into
anxious
lines
i
go
down
to
the
hollys
jill
the
first
thing
tomorrow
morning
and
see
how
he
is
and
if
there
anything
we
can
do
meanwhile
do
take
it
too
much
to
heart
dear
it
may
not
be
half
so
bad
as
you
think
always
get
things
like
that
exaggerated
you
must
remember
he
finished
speaking
with
a
lightness
that
he
did
not
feel
to
himself
the
man
owned
that
he
was
troubled
seriously
troubled
he
had
to
admit
that
jill
story
bore
the
earmarks
of
truth
and
overwhelmingly
he
realized
now
just
how
big
a
place
this
somewhat
puzzling
small
boy
had
come
to
fill
in
his
own
heart
he
did
not
need
jill
anxious
now
hurry
jack
the
next
morning
to
start
him
off
in
all
haste
for
the
holly
farmhouse
a
dozen
rods
from
the
driveway
he
met
perry
larson
and
stopped
him
abruptly
good
morning
larson
i
hope
this
is
true
what
i
hear
that
david
is
very
larson
pulled
off
his
hat
and
with
his
free
hand
sought
the
one
particular
spot
on
his
head
to
which
he
always
appealed
when
he
was
very
much
troubled
well
yes
sir
i
afraid
is
jack
er
gurnsey
i
mean
he
is
turrible
sick
poor
little
chap
an
it
too
bad
that
what
it
is
too
bad
oh
i
sorry
i
hoped
the
report
was
exaggerated
i
came
down
to
see
if
if
there
was
something
i
could
do
well
you
can
ask
there
ai
no
law
that
an
ye
need
be
afraid
neither
the
report
has
got
that
ketchin
what
he
got
and
that
he
got
it
down
to
the
glaspells
but
ai
so
the
doctor
says
he
did
ketch
nothin
an
he
ca
give
nothin
it
his
head
an
brain
that
ai
right
an
he
got
a
mighty
bad
fever
he
been
kind
of
flighty
an
nervous
anyhow
lately
as
i
was
sayin
you
can
ask
but
i
thinkin
there
wo
be
nothin
you
can
do
ter
help
that

be
done
is
bein
done
in
fact
there
ai
much
of
anythin
else
that
is
bein
done
down
there

now
but
tendin
ter
him
they
got
one
o
them
edyercated
nurses
from
the
junction
what

yer
feel
as

you
did
know
nothin
then
there
an
mis
holly
besides
if
they
had
their
way

neither
of
em
let
him
out
o
their
sight
fur
a
minute
they
that
cut
up
about
it
i
fancy
they
think
a
good
deal
of
the
boy
as
we
all
do
murmured
the
younger
man
a
little
unsteadily
larson
winkled
his
forehead
in
deep
thought
yes

that
what
beats
me
he
answered
slowly
him
holly

mean
we
expected
it
of
her
losin
her
own
boy
as
she
did
an
bein
jest
naturally
so

powerful
good

down
you
would
know
scursely
that
he
had
a
seam
on
him
sometimes
though
how
he
done
it
beats
me
now
there
mis
holly
she
tried
ter
smooth
i
warrant
lots
of
times
but
i
free
ter
say
she
hai
never
so
much
as
clipped
a
ravelin
in
all
them
forty
years
they
lived
tergether
fact
is
worked
the
other
way
with
her
all
that
her
rubbin
up
them
seams
has
amounted
to
is
ter
git
herself
so
smoothed
down
that
she
do
never
dare
ter
say
her
soul
her
own
most
generally
anyhow
not
if
he
happens
ter
intermate
it
belongs
ter
anybody
else
jack
gurnsey
suddenly
choked
over
a
cough
i
wish
i
could
do
something
he
murmured
uncertainly
ai
likely
ye
can
not
so
long
as
an
mis
holly
is
on
their
two
feet
why
there
ai
nothin
they
wo
do
an
you
believe
it
maybe
when
i
tell
you
that
yesterday
holly
he
tramped
all
through
sawyer
woods
in
the
rain
jest
ter
find
a
little
bit
of
moss
that
the
boy
was
callin
for
think
o
that
will
ye
simeon
holly
huntin
moss
an
he
got
it
too
an
brung
it
home
an
they
say
it
cut
him
up
somethin
turrible
when
the
boy
jest
turned
away
and
take
no
notice
you
understand
sir
the
little
chap
right
in
his
head
an
so
half
the
time
he
do
know
what
he
says
oh
i
sorry
sorry
exclaimed
gurnsey
as
he
turned
away
and
hurried
toward
the
farmhouse
holly
herself
answered
his
low
knock
she
looked
worn
and
pale
thank
you
sir
she
said
gratefully
in
reply
to
his
offer
of
assistance
but
there
is
anything
you
can
do
gurnsey
having
everything
done
that
can
be
and
every
one
is
very
kind
we
have
a
very
good
nurse
and
kennedy
has
had
consultation
with
benson
from
the
junction
they
are
doing
all
in
their
power
of
course
but
they
say
that
that
it
going
to
be
the
nursing
that
will
count
now
then
i
do
fear
for
him
surely
declared
the
man
with
fervor
i
know
but
well
he
shall
have
the
very
best
possible
of
that
i
know
he
will
but
is
there
anything
anything
that
i
can
do
she
shook
her
head
no
of
course
if
he
gets
better
she
hesitated
then
lifted
her
chin
a
little
higher
when
he
gets
better
she
corrected
with
courageous
emphasis
he
will
want
to
see
you
and
he
shall
see
me
asserted
gurnsey
and
he
will
be
better
holly
i
sure
he
will
yes
yes
of
course
only
oh
jack
he
so
sick
so
very
sick
the
doctor
says
he
a
peculiarly
sensitive
nature
and
that
he
thinks
something
been
troubling
him
lately
her
voice
broke
poor
little
chap
jack
voice
too
was
husky
she
looked
up
with
swift
gratefulness
for
his
sympathy
and
you
loved
him
too
i
know
she
choked
he
talks
of
you
often
very
often
indeed
i
love
him
who
could
help
it
there
could
anybody
jack
and
that
just
it
now
since
been
sick
we
wondered
more
than
ever
who
he
is
you
see
i
help
thinking
that
somewhere
he
got
friends
who
ought
to
know
about
him
now
yes
i
see
nodded
the
man
he
is
an
ordinary
boy
jack
he
been
trained
in
lots
of
ways
about
his
manners
and
at
the
table
and
all
that
and
lots
of
things
his
father
has
told
him
are
beautiful
just
beautiful
he
a
tramp
he
never
was
one
and
there
his
playing
you
know
how
he
can
play
indeed
i
do
you
must
miss
his
playing
too
i
do
he
talks
of
that
also
she
hurried
on
working
her
fingers
nervously
together
but
oftenest
he
he
speaks
of
singing
and
i
quite
understand
that
for
he
did
ever
sing
you
know
singing
what
does
he
say
the
man
asked
the
question
because
he
saw
that
it
was
affording
the
overwrought
little
woman
real
relief
to
free
her
mind
but
at
the
first
words
of
her
reply
he
became
suddenly
alert
it
song
as
he
calls
it
that
he
talks
about
always
it
much
what
he
says
but
i
noticed
it
because
he
always
says
the
same
thing
like
this
i
just
hold
up
my
chin
and
march
straight
on
and
on
and
i
sing
it
with
all
my
might
and
main
and
when
i
ask
him
what
he
going
to
sing
he
always
says
song
my
song
just
like
that
do
you
think
jack
he
did
have
a
song
for
a
moment
the
man
did
not
answer
something
in
his
throat
tightened
and
held
the
words
then
in
a
low
voice
he
managed
to
stammer
i
think
he
did
holly
and
i
think
he
sang
it
too
the
next
moment
with
a
quick
lifting
of
his
hat
and
a
murmured
i
call
again
soon
he
turned
and
walked
swiftly
down
the
driveway
so
very
swiftly
indeed
was
jack
walking
and
so
was
he
that
he
did
not
see
the
carriage
until
it
was
almost
upon
him
then
he
stepped
aside
to
let
it
pass
what
he
saw
as
he
gravely
raised
his
hat
was
a
handsome
span
of
black
horses
a
liveried
coachman
and
a
pair
of
startled
eyes
looking
straight
into
his
what
he
did
not
see
was
the
quick
gesture
with
which
miss
holbrook
almost
ordered
her
carriage
stopped
the
minute
it
had
passed
him
by
chapter
xxii
as
perry
saw
it
one
by
one
the
days
passed
and
there
came
from
the
anxious
watchers
at
david
bedside
only
the
words
there
very
little
change
often
jack
gurnsey
went
to
the
farmhouse
to
inquire
for
the
boy
often
too
he
saw
perry
larson
and
perry
was
never
loath
to
talk
of
david
it
was
from
perry
indeed
that
gurnsey
began
to
learn
some
things
of
david
that
he
had
never
known
before
it
does
beat
all
perry
larson
said
to
him
one
day
how
many
folks
asks
me
how
that
boy
is
folks
that
you
never
think
knew
him
anyhow
ter
say
nothin
of
carin
whether
he
lived
or
died
now
there
old
mis
somers
fur
instance
you
know
what
she
is
sour
as
a
lemon
puckery
as
a
chokecherry
well
if
she
did
give
me
yesterday
a
great
o
posies
she
growed
herself
an
said
they
was
fur
him
that
they
berlonged
ter
him
anyhow
i
did
exactly
sense
what
she
meant
by
that
so
i
asked
her
straight
out
an
it
seems
that
somehow
when
the
boy
first
come
he
struck
her
place
one
day
an
spied
a
great
big
red
rose
on
one
of
her
bushes
it
seems
he
had
his
fiddle
an
he
played
it
that
rose
you
know
his
way
an
she
heard
an
spoke
up
pretty
sharp
an
asked
him
what
in
time
he
was
doin
well
most
kids
would
run
knowin
her
temper
as
they
does
but
not
much
david
he
stands
up
as
pert
as
ye
please
an
tells
her
how
happy
that
red
rose
must
be
ter
make
all
that
dreary
garden
look
so
pretty
an
then
he
goes
on
merry
as
a
lark
down
the
hill
well
mis
somers
owned
up
ter
me
that
she
was
pretty
mad
at
the
time
her
garden
did
look
like
tunket
an
she
knew
it
she
said
she
had
cared
ter
do
a
thing
with
it
since
her
bessie
died
that
thought
so
much
of
it
but
after
what
david
had
said
even
mad
as
she
was
the
thing
kind
o
got
on
her
nerves
an
she
could
see
a
thing
day
or
night
but
that
red
rose
there
so
pert
an
until
at
last
jest
ter
quiet
herself
she
fairly
had
ter
set
to
slick
that
garden
up
she
said
she
raked
an
weeded
an
fixed
up
all
the
plants
there
was
in
good
shape
an
then
she
sent
down
to
the
junction
fur
some
all
growed
in
pots
was
too
late
ter
plant
seeds
an
now
it
doin
beautiful
so
she
jest
could
help
them
posies
ter
david
when
i
told
mis
holly
she
said
she
was
glad
it
happened
what
mis
somers
needed
was
somethin
ter
git
her
out
of
herself
an
i
free
ter
say
she
did
look
an
no
mistake
kind
o
like
a
chokecherry
in
blossom
ye
might
say
an
then
there
the
widder
glaspell
continued
perry
after
a
pause
any
one
would
expect
she
feel
bad
seein
as
how
good
david
was
ter
her
boy
teachin
him
ter
play
ye
know
but
mis
glaspell
says
joe
jest
does
take
on
somethin
turrible
an
he
wo
tech
the
fiddle
though
he
was
plum
carried
away
with
it
when
david
was
well
teachin
of
him
an
there
the
clark
kid
he
lame
ye
know
an
he
thought
the
world
an
all
of
david
playin
there
you
an
miss
holbrook
always
askin
an
things
but
that
ai
so
strange
you
was
his
friends
but
it
them
others
what
beats
me
why
some
days
it
soul
i
meet
jest
askin
how
he
is
an
sayin
they
hopes
git
well
sometimes
it
kids
that
he
played
to
an
i
be
triggered
if
one
of
one
day
did
have
no
excuse
to
offer
except
that
david
had
fit
him
a
cat
or
somethin
an
that
ever
since
then
he
thought
a
heap
of
him
though
he
guessed
david
did
know
it
listen
ter
that
will
ye
an
once
a
woman
held
me
up
an
took
on
turrible
but
all
i
could
git
from
her
was
that
he
sat
on
her
doorstep
an
played
ter
her
baby
once
or
twice
as
if
that
was
anythin
but
one
of
the
derndest
funny
ones
was
the
woman
who
said
she
could
wash
her
dishes
a
sight
easier
after
she
him
go
by
playin
there
was
bill
dowd
too
you
know
he
really
has
got
a
screw
loose
in
his
head
somewheres
an
there
any
one
but
what
says
he
the
town
fool
all
right
well
what
do
ye
think
he
said
jack
shook
his
head
well
he
said
he
did
hope
as
how
nothin
would
happen
ter
that
boy
cause
he
did
so
like
ter
see
him
smile
an
that
he
always
did
smile
every
time
he
met
him
there
what
do
ye
think
o
that
well
i
think
perry
returned
jack
soberly
that
bill
dowd
was
playing
the
fool
when
he
said
that
quite
so
much
as
he
sometimes
is
perhaps
maybe
not
murmured
perry
larson
perplexedly
still
i
free
ter
say
i
do
think
was
kind
o
queer
he
paused
then
slapped
his
knee
suddenly
say
did
i
tell
ye
about
streeter
old
bill
streeter
an
the
pear
tree
again
jack
shook
his
head
well
then
i
goin
to
declared
the
other
with
gleeful
emphasis
an
say
i
do
believe
even
you
can
explain
this
i
do
well
you
know
streeter
one
does
so
i
ai
sayin
he
was
cut
on
a
bias
an
that
bias
runs
ter
money
every
time
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
he
wo
lift
his
finger
unless
there
a
dollar
stickin
to
it
an
that
he
hai
no
use
fur
nor
anybody
unless
there
money
in
it
for
him
i
blamed
if
i
think
that
if
he
ever
gits
ter
heaven
he
pluck
his
own
wings
sell
the
feathers
fur
what
they
bring
oh
perry
remonstrated
jack
in
a
voice
perry
larson
only
grinned
and
went
on
imperturbably
well
seein
as
we
both
understand
what
he
is
i
tell
ye
what
he
done
he
called
me
up
ter
his
fence
one
day
big
as
life
an
says
he
the
boy
an
you
could
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
streeter
how
a
boy
was
that
was
sick
an
he
seemed
ter
care
too
i
hai
seen
him
look
so
longfaced
since
since
he
was
paid
up
on
a
sartin
note
i
knows
of
jest
as
he
was
smackin
his
lips
over
a
nice
fat
farm
that
was
comin
to
him
well
i
was
that
plum
puzzled
that
i
meant
ter
find
out
why
streeter
was
takin
sech
notice
if
i
hung
fur
it
so
i
set
to
on
a
little
detective
work
of
my
own
knowin
of
course
that
no
use
askin
of
him
himself
well
an
what
do
you
i
found
out
if
that
little
scamp
of
a
boy
had
even
got
round
him
streeter
the
skinflint
he
had
an
he
went
there
often
the
neighbors
said
streeter
doted
on
him
they
declared
that
actually
he
give
him
a
cent
once
though
that
part
i
ai
swallerin
yet
they
said
the
neighbors
did
that
it
all
started
from
the
pear
tree
that
big
one
ter
the
left
of
his
house
maybe
you
remember
it
well
anyhow
it
seems
that
it
old
an
through
bearin
any
fruit
though
it
still
blossoms
fit
ter
kill
every
year
only
a
little
late
always
an
the
blossoms
stay
on
common
as
if
they
knew
there
nothin
doin
later
well
old
streeter
said
it
had
got
ter
come
down
i
reckon
he
suspected
it
of
swipin
some
of
the
sunshine
or
maybe
a
little
rain
that
belonged
ter
the
tree
side
of
the
road
what
did
bear
fruit
an
was
worth
somethin
anyhow
he
got
his
man
an
his
axe
an
was
plum
ready
ter
start
in
when
he
sees
david
an
david
sees
him
was
when
the
boy
first
come
he
gone
ter
walk
an
had
struck
this
pear
tree
all
in
bloom
an
you
know
how
the
boy
would
act
a
pear
tree
bloomin
is
a
likely
sight
i
own
he
danced
and
laughed
and
clapped
his
hands
he
did
have
his
fiddle
with
him
an
carried
on
like
all
possessed
then
he
sees
the
man
with
the
axe
an
streeter
an
streeter
sees
him
they
said
it
was
rich
then
bill
warner
heard
it
all
from
side
of
the
fence
he
said
that
david
when
he
found
out
what
was
goin
ter
happen
went
clean
crazy
an
rampaged
on
at
such
a
rate
that
old
streeter
could
do
nothin
but
stand
an
stare
until
he
finally
managed
ter
growl
out
i
tell
ye
boy
the
tree
ai
no
use
no
more
bill
says
the
boy
flew
all
to
pieces
then
use
no
use
he
cries
a
perfectly
beautiful
thing
as
that
no
use
why
it
do
have
ter
be
any
use
when
it
so
pretty
it
jest
ter
look
at
an
love
be
happy
with
fancy
sayin
that
ter
old
streeter
i
like
ter
seen
his
face
but
bill
says
that
half
what
the
boy
said
he
declared
that
was
god
present
anyhow
that
trees
was
an
that
the
things
he
give
us
ter
look
at
was
jest
as
much
use
as
the
things
he
give
us
ter
eat
an
that
the
stars
an
the
sunsets
an
the
snowflakes
an
the
little
white
an
i
do
know
was
jest
as
important
in
the
orchestra
of
life
as
turnips
an
squashes
an
then
billy
says
he
ended
by
jest
flingin
himself
on
ter
streeter
beggin
him
ter
wait
till
he
could
go
back
an
git
his
fiddle
so
he
could
tell
him
what
a
beautiful
thing
that
tree
was
well
if
you
believe
it
old
streeter
was
so
plum
befuzzled
he
sent
the
man
an
the
axe
away
an
that
tree
is
he
finished
then
with
a
sudden
gloom
on
his
face
larson
added
huskily
an
i
only
hope
i
be
sayin
the
same
thing
of
that
boy
come
next
month
at
this
time
we
hope
you
will
sighed
the
other
fervently
and
so
one
by
one
the
days
passed
while
the
whole
town
waited
and
while
in
the
great
airy
parlor
bedroom
of
the
holly
farmhouse
one
small
boy
fought
his
battle
for
life
then
came
the
blackest
day
and
night
of
all
when
the
town
could
only
wait
and
watch
it
had
lost
its
hope
when
the
doctors
shook
their
heads
and
refused
to
meet
holly
eyes
when
the
pulse
in
the
slim
wrist
outside
the
coverlet
played
with
the
cool
persistent
fingers
that
sought
so
earnestly
for
it
when
perry
larson
sat
for
uncounted
sleepless
hours
by
the
kitchen
stove
and
fearfully
listened
for
a
step
crossing
the
hallway
when
jack
on
his
porch
and
miss
holbrook
in
her
tower
widow
went
with
david
down
into
the
dark
valley
and
came
so
near
the
rushing
river
that
life
with
its
petty
prides
and
prejudices
could
never
seem
quite
the
same
to
them
again
then
after
that
blackest
day
and
night
came
the
dawn
as
the
dawns
do
come
after
the
blackest
of
days
and
nights
in
the
slender
wrist
outside
the
coverlet
the
pulse
gained
and
steadied
on
the
forehead
beneath
the
nurse
fingers
a
moisture
came
the
doctors
nodded
their
heads
now
and
looked
every
one
straight
in
the
eye
he
will
live
they
said
the
crisis
is
passed
out
by
the
kitchen
stove
perry
larson
heard
the
step
cross
the
hall
and
sprang
upright
but
at
the
first
glimpse
of
holly
yet
radiant
face
he
collapsed
limply
gosh
he
muttered
say
do
you
know
i
did
i
did
care
so
much
i
reckon
i
go
an

puzzles
david
convalescence
was
picturesque
in
a
way
as
soon
as
he
was
able
like
a
king
he
sat
upon
his
throne
and
received
his
subjects
and
a
very
gracious
king
he
was
indeed
his
room
overflowed
with
flowers
and
fruit
and
his
bed
quite
groaned
with
the
toys
and
books
and
games
brought
for
his
diversion
each
one
of
which
he
hailed
with
delight
from
miss
holbrook
sumptuously
bound
waverley
novels
to
little
crippled
jimmy
clark
bag
of
marbles
only
two
things
puzzled
david
one
was
why
everybody
was
so
good
to
him
and
the
other
was
why
he
never
could
have
the
pleasure
of
both
jack
and
miss
holbrook
company
at
the
same
time
david
discovered
this
last
curious
circumstance
concerning
jack
and
miss
holbrook
very
early
in
his
convalescence
it
was
on
the
second
afternoon
that
jack
had
been
admitted
to
the
david
had
been
hearing
all
the
latest
news
of
jill
and
joe
when
suddenly
he
noticed
an
odd
change
come
to
his
visitor
face
the
windows
of
the
holly
parlor
bedroom
commanded
a
fine
view
of
the
road
and
it
was
toward
one
of
these
windows
that
jack
eyes
were
directed
david
sitting
up
in
bed
saw
then
that
down
the
road
was
approaching
very
swiftly
a
handsome
span
of
black
horses
and
an
open
carriage
which
he
had
come
to
recognize
as
belonging
to
miss
holbrook
he
watched
it
eagerly
now
till
he
saw
the
horses
turn
in
at
the
holly
driveway
then
he
gave
a
low
cry
of
delight
it
my
lady
of
the
roses
she
coming
to
see
me
look
oh
i
so
glad
now
you
see
her
and
just
know
how
lovely
she
is
why
jack
you
are
going
now
he
broke
off
in
manifest
disappointment
as
jack
leaped
to
his
feet
i
think
i
have
to
if
you
do
mind
david
returned
the
man
an
oddly
nervous
haste
in
his
manner
and
you
wo
mind
now
that
have
miss
holbrook
i
want
to
speak
to
larson
i
saw
him
in
the
field
out
there
a
minute
ago
and
i
guess
i
slip
right
through
this
window
here
too
david
i
do
want
to
lose
him
and
i
can
catch
him
quicker
this
way
than
any
other
he
finished
throwing
up
the
sash
oh
but
jack
please
just
wait
a
minute
begged
david
i
wanted
you
to
see
my
lady
of
the
roses
and
but
jack
was
already
on
the
ground
outside
the
low
window
and
the
next
minute
with
a
merry
nod
and
smile
he
had
pulled
the
sash
down
after
him
and
was
hurrying
away
almost
at
once
then
miss
holbrook
appeared
at
the
bedroom
door
holly
said
i
was
to
walk
right
in
david
so
here
i
am
she
began
in
a
cheery
voice
oh
you
looking
lots
better
than
when
i
saw
you
monday
young
man
i
am
better
caroled
david
and
i
better
because
jack
has
been
here
oh
has
jack
been
to
see
you
there
was
an
indefinable
change
in
miss
holbrook
voice
yes
right
now
why
he
was
here
when
you
were
driving
into
the
yard
miss
holbrook
gave
a
perceptible
start
and
looked
about
her
a
little
wildly
here
when
but
i
did
meet
him
anywhere
in
the
hall
he
did
go
through
the
hall
laughed
david
gleefully
he
went
right
through
that
window
there
the
window
an
angry
flush
mounted
to
miss
holbrook
forehead
indeed
did
he
have
to
resort
to
that
to
escape
she
bit
her
lip
and
stopped
abruptly
david
eyes
widened
a
little
escape
oh
he
was
the
one
that
was
escaping
it
was
perry
jack
was
afraid
he
lose
him
he
saw
him
out
the
window
there
right
after
he
seen
you
and
he
said
he
wanted
to
speak
to
him
and
he
was
afraid
he
get
away
so
he
jumped
right
through
that
window
there
see
oh
yes
i
see
murmured
miss
holbrook
in
a
voice
david
thought
was
a
little
queer
i
wanted
him
to
stay
frowned
david
uncertainly
i
wanted
him
to
see
you
dear
me
david
i
hope
you
did
tell
him
so
oh
yes
i
did
but
he
could
stay
even
then
you
see
he
wanted
to
catch
perry
larson
i
no
doubt
of
it
retorted
miss
holbrook
with
so
much
emphasis
that
david
again
looked
at
her
with
a
slightly
disturbed
frown
but
he
come
again
soon
i
sure
and
then
maybe
you
be
here
too
i
do
so
want
him
to
see
you
lady
of
the
roses
nonsense
david
laughed
miss
holbrook
a
little
nervously
gurnsey
does
want
to
see
me
he
seen
me
dozens
of
times
oh
yes
he
told
me
he
seen
you
long
ago
nodded
david
gravely
but
he
did
act
as
if
he
remembered
it
much
did
he
indeed
laughed
miss
holbrook
again
flushing
a
little
well
i
sure
dear
we
would
want
to
tax
the
poor
memory
too
much
you
know
come
suppose
you
see
what
i
brought
you
she
finished
gayly
oh
what
is
it
cried
david
as
under
miss
holbrook
swift
fingers
the
wrappings
fell
away
and
disclosed
a
box
which
upon
being
opened
was
found
to
be
filled
with
quantities
of
oddly
shaped
bits
of
pictured
wood
a
jumble
of
confusion
it
a
puzzle
david
all
these
little
pieces
fitted
together
make
a
picture
you
see
i
tried
last
night
and
i
could
do
it
i
brought
it
down
to
see
if
you
could
oh
thank
you
i
love
to
rejoiced
the
boy
and
in
the
fascination
of
the
marvel
of
finding
one
fantastic
bit
that
fitted
another
david
apparently
forgot
all
about
jack
which
seemed
not
unpleasing
to
his
lady
of
the
roses
it
was
not
until
nearly
a
week
later
that
david
had
his
wish
of
seeing
his
jack
and
his
lady
of
the
roses
meet
at
his
bedside
it
was
the
day
miss
holbrook
brought
to
him
the
wonderful
set
of
handsomely
bound
waverley
novels
he
was
still
glorying
in
his
new
possession
in
fact
when
jack
appeared
suddenly
in
the
doorway
hullo
my
boy
i
just
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
supposed
you
were
alone
he
stammered
looking
very
red
indeed
he
is
that
is
he
will
be
soon
except
for
you
gurnsey
smiled
miss
holbrook
very
brightly
she
was
already
on
her
feet
no
no
i
beg
of
you
stammered
jack
growing
still
more
red
do
let
me
drive
that
is
i
mean
do
go
please
i
did
know
i
had
no
warning
i
did
see
your
carriage
was
not
at
the
door
miss
holbrook
eyebrows
rose
the
fraction
of
an
inch
i
sent
it
home
i
am
planning
to
walk
back
i
have
several
calls
to
make
on
the
way
and
it
high
time
i
was
starting
david
but
lady
of
the
roses
please
please
do
go
besought
david
who
had
been
looking
from
one
to
the
other
in
worried
dismay
why
you
just
come
but
neither
coaxing
nor
argument
availed
and
before
david
really
knew
just
what
had
happened
he
found
himself
alone
with
jack
even
then
disappointment
was
piled
on
disappointment
for
visit
was
not
the
unalloyed
happiness
it
usually
was
jack
himself
was
almost
cross
at
first
and
then
he
was
silent
and
restless
moving
jerkily
about
the
room
in
a
way
that
disturbed
david
very
much
jack
had
brought
with
him
a
book
but
even
that
only
made
matters
worse
for
when
he
saw
the
beautifully
bound
volumes
that
miss
holbrook
had
just
left
he
frowned
and
told
david
that
he
guessed
he
did
not
need
his
gift
at
all
with
all
those
other
fine
books
and
david
could
not
seem
to
make
him
understand
that
the
one
book
from
him
was
just
exactly
as
dear
as
were
the
whole
set
of
books
that
his
lady
of
the
roses
brought
certainly
it
was
not
a
satisfactory
visit
at
all
and
for
the
first
time
david
was
almost
glad
to
have
jack
go
and
leave
him
with
his
books
the
books
david
told
himself
he
could
understand
jack
he
could
not
several
times
after
this
david
lady
of
the
roses
and
jack
happened
to
call
at
the
same
hour
but
never
could
david
persuade
these
two
friends
of
his
to
stay
together
always
if
one
came
and
the
other
was
there
the
other
went
away
in
spite
of
david
protestations
that
two
people
did
not
tire
him
at
all
and
his
assertions
that
he
often
entertained
as
many
as
that
at
once
tractable
as
they
were
in
all
other
ways
anxious
as
they
seemed
to
please
him
on
this
one
point
they
were
obdurate
never
would
they
stay
together
they
were
not
angry
with
each
other
david
was
sure
of
that
for
they
were
always
very
especially
polite
and
rose
and
stood
and
bowed
in
a
most
delightful
fashion
still
he
sometimes
thought
that
they
did
not
quite
like
each
other
for
always
after
the
one
went
away
the
other
left
behind
was
silent
and
almost
stern
if
it
was
jack
and
and
nervous
if
it
was
miss
holbrook
but
why
this
was
so
david
could
not
understand
the
span
of
handsome
black
horses
came
very
frequently
to
the
holly
farmhouse
now
and
as
time
passed
they
often
bore
away
behind
them
a
but
boy
on
the
seat
beside
miss
holbrook
my
but
i
do
see
how
every
one
can
be
so
good
to
me
exclaimed
the
boy
one
day
to
his
lady
of
the
roses
oh
that
easy
david
she
smiled
the
only
trouble
is
to
find
out
what
you
want
you
ask
for
so
little
but
i
do
need
to
ask
you
do
it
all
beforehand
asserted
the
boy
you
and
jack
and
everybody
really
that
good
for
a
brief
moment
miss
holbrook
hesitated
then
as
if
casually
she
asked
and
he
tells
you
stories
too
i
suppose
this
jack
just
as
he
used
to
does
he
well
he
never
did
tell
me
but
one
you
know
before
but
he
told
me
more
now
since
i
been
sick
oh
yes
i
remember
and
that
one
was
princess
and
the
pauper
was
it
well
has
he
told
you
any
more
like
that
the
boy
shook
his
head
with
decision
no
he
does
tell
me
any
more
like
that
and
and
i
do
want
him
to
either
miss
holbrook
laughed
a
little
oddly
why
david
what
is
the
matter
with
that
she
queried
the
ending
it
was
nice
you
know
oh
yes
i
i
remember
i
asked
him
to
change
it
went
on
david
in
a
grieved
voice
i
asked
him
just
the
other
day
but
he
would
perhaps
he
he
did
want
to
miss
holbrook
spoke
very
quickly
but
so
low
that
david
barely
heard
the
words
did
want
to
oh
yes
he
did
he
looked
awful
sober
and
as
if
he
really
cared
you
know
and
he
said
he
give
all
he
had
in
the
world
if
he
really
could
change
it
but
he
could
did
he
say
just
that
miss
holbrook
was
leaning
forward
a
little
breathlessly
now
yes
just
that
and
that
the
part
i
could
understand
commented
david
for
i
do
see
why
a
story
just
a
story
made
up
out
of
somebody
head
ca
be
changed
any
way
you
want
it
and
i
told
him
so
well
and
what
did
he
say
to
that
he
did
say
anything
for
a
minute
and
i
had
to
ask
him
again
then
he
sat
up
suddenly
just
as
if
he
been
asleep
you
know
and
said
what
david
and
then
i
told
him
again
what
i
said
this
time
he
shook
his
head
and
smiled
that
kind
of
a
smile
that
is
really
a
smile
you
know
and
said
something
about
a
real
never
having
but
one
ending
and
that
was
a
logical
ending
lady
of
the
roses
what
is
a
logical
ending
the
lady
of
the
roses
laughed
unexpectedly
the
two
little
red
spots
that
david
always
loved
to
see
flamed
into
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
showed
a
sudden
sparkle
when
she
answered
her
words
came
disconnectedly
with
little
laughing
breaths
between
well
david
i
i
not
sure
i
can
tell
you
but
perhaps
i
can
find
out
this
much
however
i
am
sure
of
jack
logical
ending
would
be
mine
what
she
meant
david
did
not
know
nor
would
she
tell
him
when
he
asked
but
a
few
days
later
she
sent
for
him
and
very
gladly
david
able
now
to
go
where
he
pleased
obeyed
the
summons
it
was
november
and
the
garden
was
bleak
and
cold
but
in
the
library
a
bright
fire
danced
on
the
hearth
and
before
this
miss
holbrook
drew
up
two
low
chairs
she
looked
particularly
pretty
david
thought
the
rich
red
of
her
dress
had
apparently
brought
out
an
answering
red
in
her
cheeks
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
her
lips
smiled
yet
she
seemed
oddly
nervous
and
restless
she
sewed
a
little
with
a
bit
of
yellow
silk
on
white
but
not
for
long
she
knitted
with
two
long
ivory
needles
flashing
in
and
out
of
a
silky
mesh
of
blue
but
this
too
she
soon
ceased
doing
on
a
low
stand
at
david
side
she
had
placed
books
and
pictures
and
for
a
time
she
talked
of
those
then
very
abruptly
she
asked
david
when
will
you
see
jack
again
do
you
suppose
tomorrow
i
going
up
to
the
house
that
jack
built
to
tea
and
i
to
stay
all
night
it
halloween
that
is
it
is
really
halloween
because
it
too
late
i
lost
that
being
sick
you
know
so
going
to
pretend
and
jack
is
going
to
show
me
what
it
is
like
that
is
what
jack
and
jill
always
do
when
something
ails
the
real
thing
they
just
pretend
with
the
one
he
planned
lots
of
things
for
jill
and
me
to
do
with
nuts
and
apples
and
candles
you
know
it
night
so
i
see
him
then
so
so
soon
faltered
miss
holbrook
and
to
david
gazing
at
her
with
wondering
eyes
it
seemed
for
a
moment
almost
as
if
she
were
looking
about
for
a
place
to
which
she
might
run
and
hide
then
determinedly
as
if
she
were
taking
hold
of
something
with
both
hands
she
leaned
forward
looked
david
squarely
in
the
eyes
and
began
to
talk
hurriedly
yet
very
distinctly
david
listen
i
something
i
want
you
to
say
to
jack
and
i
want
you
to
be
sure
and
get
it
just
right
it
about
the
the
story
princess
and
the
pauper
you
know
you
can
remember
i
think
for
you
remembered
that
so
well
will
you
say
it
to
him
what
i
going
to
tell
you
just
as
i
say
it
why
of
course
i
will
david
promise
was
unhesitating
though
his
eyes
were
still
puzzled
it
about
the
the
ending
stammered
miss
holbrook
that
is
it
may
it
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
ending
perhaps
she
finished
lamely
and
again
david
noticed
that
odd
shifting
of
miss
holbrook
gaze
as
if
she
were
searching
for
some
means
of
escape
then
as
before
he
saw
her
chin
lift
determinedly
as
she
began
to
talk
faster
than
ever
now
listen
she
admonished
him
earnestly
and
david
listened
chapter
xxiv
a
story
remodeled
the
pretended
halloween
was
a
great
success
so
very
excited
indeed
did
david
become
over
the
swinging
apples
and
popping
nuts
that
he
quite
forgot
to
tell
jack
what
the
lady
of
the
roses
had
said
until
jill
had
gone
up
to
bed
and
he
himself
was
about
to
take
from
jack
hand
the
little
lighted
lamp
oh
jack
i
forgot
he
cried
then
there
was
something
i
was
going
to
tell
you
never
mind
david
it
so
late
suppose
we
leave
it
until
suggested
jack
still
with
the
lamp
extended
in
his
hand
but
i
promised
the
lady
of
the
roses
that
i
say
it
demurred
the
boy
in
a
troubled
voice
the
man
drew
his
lamp
halfway
back
suddenly
the
lady
of
the
roses
do
you
mean
she
sent
a
message
to
me
he
demanded
yes
about
the
story
princess
and
the
pauper
you
know
with
an
abrupt
exclamation
jack
set
the
lamp
on
the
table
and
turned
to
a
chair
he
had
apparently
lost
his
haste
to
go
to
bed
see
here
david
suppose
you
come
and
sit
down
and
tell
me
just
what
you
talking
about
and
first
just
what
does
the
lady
of
the
roses
know
about
that
that
and
the
pauper
why
she
knows
it
all
of
course
returned
the
boy
in
surprise
i
told
it
to
her
you
told
it
to
her
jack
relaxed
in
his
chair
david
yes
and
she
was
just
as
interested
as
could
be
i
do
doubt
it
jack
lips
snapped
together
a
little
grimly
only
she
did
like
the
ending
either
jack
sat
up
suddenly
she
did
like
david
are
you
sure
did
she
say
that
david
frowned
in
thought
well
i
do
know
as
i
can
tell
exactly
but
i
sure
she
did
like
it
because
just
before
she
told
me
what
to
say
to
you
she
said
that
that
what
she
was
going
to
say
would
probably
have
something
to
do
with
the
ending
anyway
still
david
paused
in
yet
deeper
thought
come
to
think
of
it
there
really
is
anything
not
in
what
she
said
that
changed
that
ending
as
i
can
see
they
did
get
married
and
live
happy
ever
after
anyhow
yes
but
what
did
she
say
asked
jack
in
a
voice
that
was
not
quite
steady
now
be
careful
david
and
tell
it
just
as
she
said
it
oh
i
will
nodded
david
she
said
to
do
that
too
did
she
jack
leaned
farther
forward
in
his
chair
but
tell
me
how
did
she
happen
to
to
say
anything
about
it
suppose
you
begin
at
the
beginning
away
back
david
i
want
to
hear
it
all
all
david
gave
a
contented
sigh
and
settled
himself
more
comfortably
well
to
begin
with
you
see
i
told
her
the
story
long
ago
before
i
was
sick
and
she
was
ever
so
interested
then
and
asked
lots
of
questions
then
the
other
day
something
came
up
i
forgotten
how
about
the
ending
and
i
told
her
how
hard
i
tried
to
have
you
change
it
but
you
would
and
she
spoke
right
up
quick
and
said
probably
you
did
want
to
change
it
anyhow
but
of
course
i
settled
that
question
without
any
trouble
went
on
david
confidently
by
just
telling
her
how
you
said
you
give
anything
in
the
world
to
change
it
and
you
told
her
that
just
that
david
cried
the
man
why
yes
i
had
to
answered
david
in
surprise
else
she
have
known
that
you
did
want
to
change
it
do
you
see
oh
yes
i
see
a
good
deal
that
i
thinking
you
do
muttered
jack
falling
back
in
his
chair
well
then
is
when
i
told
her
about
the
logical
ending
what
you
said
you
know
oh
yes
and
that
was
when
i
found
out
she
did
like
the
ending
because
she
laughed
such
a
funny
little
laugh
and
colored
up
and
said
that
she
was
sure
she
could
tell
me
what
a
logical
ending
was
but
that
she
would
try
to
find
out
and
that
anyhow
your
ending
would
be
hers
she
was
sure
of
that
david
did
she
say
that
really
jack
was
on
his
feet
now
she
did
and
then
yesterday
she
asked
me
to
come
over
and
she
said
some
more
things
about
the
story
i
mean
but
she
did
say
another
thing
about
the
ending
she
did
ever
say
anything
about
that
except
that
little
bit
i
told
you
of
a
minute
ago
yes
yes
but
what
did
she
say
demanded
jack
stopping
short
in
his
walk
up
and
down
the
room
she
said
tell
jack
that
i
know
something
about
that
story
of
his
that
perhaps
he
does
in
the
first
place
i
know
the
princess
a
lot
better
than
he
does
and
she
is
a
bit
the
kind
of
girl
pictured
her
yes
go
on
go
on
for
instance
she
says
the
boy
made
that
call
after
the
girl
first
came
back
and
when
the
boy
did
like
it
because
they
talked
of
colleges
and
travels
and
such
things
you
tell
him
that
i
happen
to
know
that
that
girl
was
just
hoping
and
hoping
he
speak
of
the
old
days
and
games
but
that
she
could
speak
of
course
when
he
had
been
even
once
to
see
her
during
all
those
weeks
and
when
he
acted
in
every
way
just
as
if
he
forgotten
but
she
had
waved
that
princess
had
waved
once
argued
jack
and
he
looked
and
looked
for
it
yes
she
spoke
of
that
returned
david
but
she
said
she
think
the
princess
would
have
waved
when
she
got
to
be
such
a
great
big
girl
as
that
waving
to
a
boy
she
said
that
for
her
part
she
should
have
been
ashamed
of
her
if
she
had
oh
did
she
murmured
jack
blankly
dropping
suddenly
into
his
chair
yes
she
did
repeated
david
with
a
little
virtuous
uplifting
of
his
chin
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
david
sympathies
had
unaccountably
met
with
a
change
of
heart
but
the
pauper
oh
yes
and
that
another
thing
interrupted
david
the
lady
of
the
roses
said
that
she
did
like
that
name
one
bit
that
it
true
anyway
because
he
was
a
pauper
and
she
said
too
that
as
for
his
picturing
the
princess
as
being
perfectly
happy
in
all
that
magnificence
he
did
get
it
right
at
all
for
she
knew
that
the
princess
was
one
bit
happy
because
she
was
so
lonesome
for
things
and
people
she
had
known
when
she
was
just
the
girl
again
jack
sprang
to
his
feet
for
a
minute
he
strode
up
and
down
the
room
in
silence
then
in
a
shaking
voice
he
asked
david
you
you
are
making
all
this
up
are
you
you
saying
just
what
what
miss
holbrook
told
you
to
why
of
course
i
not
making
it
up
protested
the
boy
aggrievedly
this
is
the
lady
of
the
roses
story
she
made
it
up
only
she
talked
it
as
if
was
real
of
course
just
as
you
did
she
said
another
thing
too
she
said
that
she
happened
to
know
that
the
princess
had
got
all
that
magnificence
around
her
in
the
first
place
just
to
see
if
it
would
make
her
happy
but
that
it
had
and
that
now
she
had
one
place
a
little
room
that
was
left
just
as
it
used
to
be
when
she
was
the
girl
and
that
she
went
there
and
sat
very
often
and
she
said
it
was
right
in
sight
of
where
the
boy
lived
too
where
he
could
see
it
every
day
and
that
if
he
had
been
so
blind
he
could
have
looked
right
through
those
gray
walls
and
seen
that
and
seen
lots
of
other
things
and
what
did
she
mean
by
that
mr
jack
i
do
know
i
do
know
david
jack
sometimes
i
think
she
means
and
then
i
think
that
ca
be
true
but
do
you
think
it
helped
it
any
the
story
persisted
the
boy
she
only
talked
a
little
about
the
princess
she
did
really
change
things
any
not
the
ending
but
she
said
it
might
david
she
said
it
might
do
you
remember
cried
the
man
eagerly
and
to
david
his
eagerness
did
not
seem
at
all
strange
jack
had
said
before
long
ago
that
he
would
be
very
glad
indeed
to
have
a
happier
ending
to
this
tale
think
now
continued
the
man
perhaps
she
said
something
else
too
did
she
say
anything
else
david
david
shook
his
head
slowly
no
only
yes
there
was
a
little
something
but
it
does
change
things
any
for
it
was
only
a
she
said
supposing
after
long
years
that
the
princess
found
out
about
how
the
boy
felt
long
ago
and
suppose
he
should
look
up
at
the
tower
some
day
at
the
old
time
and
see
a
one
two
wave
which
meant
come
over
to
see
me
just
what
do
you
suppose
he
would
do
but
of
course
that
ca
do
any
good
finished
david
gloomily
as
he
rose
to
go
to
bed
for
that
was
only
a
of
course
agreed
jack
steadily
and
david
did
not
know
that
only
stern
had
forced
the
steadiness
into
that
voice
nor
that
for
jack
the
whole
world
had
burst
suddenly
into
song
neither
did
david
the
next
morning
know
that
long
before
eight
jack
stood
at
a
certain
window
his
eyes
unswervingly
fixed
on
the
gray
towers
of
sunnycrest
what
david
did
know
however
was
that
just
after
eight
jack
strode
through
the
room
where
he
and
jill
were
playing
checkers
flung
himself
into
his
hat
and
coat
and
then
fairly
leaped
down
the
steps
toward
the
path
that
led
to
the
footbridge
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
why
whatever
in
the
world
ails
jack
gasped
jill
then
after
a
startled
pause
she
asked
david
do
folks
ever
go
crazy
for
joy
yesterday
you
see
jack
got
two
splendid
pieces
of
news
one
was
from
his
doctor
he
was
examined
and
he
fine
the
doctor
says
all
well
so
he
can
go
back
now
any
time
to
the
city
and
work
i
shall
go
to
school
then
you
know
a
young
ladies
school
she
finished
a
little
importantly
he
well
how
splendid
but
what
was
the
other
news
you
said
there
were
two
only
it
could
have
been
nicer
than
that
was
to
be
well
all
well
the
other
well
that
was
only
that
his
old
place
in
the
city
was
waiting
for
him
he
was
with
a
firm
of
big
lawyers
you
know
and
of
course
it
is
nice
to
have
a
place
all
waiting
but
i
ca
see
anything
in
those
things
to
make
him
act
like
this
now
can
you
why
yes
maybe
declared
david
he
found
his
work
do
you
see
out
in
the
world
and
he
going
to
do
it
i
know
how
i
feel
if
i
had
found
mine
that
father
told
me
of
only
what
i
ca
understand
is
if
jack
knew
all
this
yesterday
why
did
he
act
like
this
then
instead
of
waiting
till
i
wonder
said
jill
chapter
xxv
the
beautiful
world
david
found
many
new
songs
in
his
violin
those
early
winter
days
and
they
were
very
beautiful
ones
to
begin
with
there
were
all
the
kindly
looks
and
deeds
that
were
showered
upon
him
from
every
side
there
was
the
first
snowstorm
too
with
the
feathery
flakes
turning
all
the
world
to
fairy
whiteness
this
song
david
played
to
streeter
one
day
and
great
was
his
disappointment
that
the
man
could
not
seem
to
understand
what
the
song
said
but
do
you
see
pleaded
david
i
telling
you
that
it
your
blossoms
come
back
to
say
how
glad
they
are
that
you
kill
them
that
day
blossoms
come
back
ejaculated
the
old
man
well
no
i
ca
see
where
yer
blossoms
why
there
out
of
the
window
everywhere
urged
the
boy
there
by
ginger
boy
ye
do
mean
ye
ca
mean
the
snow
of
course
i
do
now
ca
you
see
it
why
the
whole
tree
was
just
a
great
big
cloud
of
snowflakes
do
you
remember
well
now
it
gone
away
and
got
a
whole
lot
more
trees
and
all
the
little
white
petals
have
come
dancing
down
to
celebrate
and
to
tell
you
they
sure
are
coming
back
next
year
well
by
ginger
exclaimed
the
man
again
then
suddenly
he
threw
back
his
head
with
a
hearty
laugh
david
did
not
quite
like
the
laugh
neither
did
he
care
for
the
piece
that
the
man
thrust
into
his
fingers
a
little
later
though
had
david
but
known
it
both
the
laugh
and
the
piece
gift
were
for
the
uncomprehending
man
who
gave
them
white
milestones
along
an
unfamiliar
way
it
was
soon
after
this
that
there
came
to
david
the
great
surprise
his
beloved
lady
of
the
roses
and
his
no
less
beloved
jack
were
to
be
married
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
so
very
surprised
indeed
was
david
at
this
that
even
his
violin
was
mute
and
had
nothing
at
first
to
say
about
it
but
to
jack
as
man
to
man
david
said
one
day
i
thought
men
when
they
married
women
went
courting
in
they
do
and
you
you
hardly
ever
said
a
word
to
my
beautiful
lady
of
the
roses
and
you
spoke
once
long
ago
as
if
you
scarcely
remembered
her
at
all
now
what
do
you
mean
by
that
and
jack
laughed
but
he
grew
red
too
and
then
he
told
it
all
that
it
was
just
the
story
of
the
princess
and
the
pauper
and
that
he
david
had
been
the
one
as
it
happened
to
do
part
of
their
courting
for
them
and
how
david
had
laughed
then
and
how
he
had
fairly
hugged
himself
for
joy
and
when
next
he
had
picked
up
his
violin
what
a
beautiful
beautiful
song
he
had
found
about
it
in
the
vibrant
strings
it
was
this
same
song
as
it
chanced
that
he
was
playing
in
his
room
that
saturday
afternoon
when
the
letter
from
simeon
holly
son
john
came
to
the
holly
farmhouse
downstairs
in
the
kitchen
simeon
holly
stood
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
ellen
we
got
a
letter
from
john
he
said
that
simeon
holly
spoke
of
it
at
all
showed
how
very
far
along
his
unfamiliar
way
he
had
come
since
the
last
letter
from
john
had
arrived
from
john
oh
simeon
from
john
yes
simeon
sat
down
and
tried
to
hide
the
shaking
of
his
hand
as
he
ran
the
point
of
his
knife
under
the
flap
of
the
envelope
we
see
what
he
says
and
to
hear
him
one
might
have
thought
that
letters
from
john
were
everyday
occurrences
dear
father
twice
before
i
have
written
ran
the
letter
and
received
no
answer
but
i
going
to
make
one
more
effort
for
forgiveness
may
i
not
come
to
you
this
christmas
i
have
a
little
boy
of
my
own
now
and
my
heart
aches
for
you
i
know
how
i
should
feel
should
he
in
years
to
come
do
as
i
did
i
not
deceive
you
i
have
not
given
up
my
art
you
told
me
once
to
choose
between
you
and
it
and
i
chose
i
suppose
at
least
i
ran
away
yet
in
the
face
of
all
that

ask
you
again

not
come
to
you
at
christmas
i

see
my
boy

said
simeon
holly
trying
to
speak
with
a
steady
coldness
that
would
not
show
how
deeply
moved
he
was
well
ellen
yes
simeon
yes
choked
his
wife
a
world
of
and
longing
in
her
pleading
eyes
and
voice
yes
you
let
it
be
uncle
simeon
aunt
ellen
called
david
clattering
down
the
stairs
from
his
room
i
found
such
a
beautiful
song
in
my
violin
and
going
to
play
it
over
and
over
so
as
to
be
sure
and
remember
it
for
father
for
it
is
a
beautiful
world
uncle
simeon
is
it
now
listen
and
simeon
holly
listened
but
it
was
not
the
violin
that
he
heard
it
was
the
voice
of
a
little
boy
out
of
the
past
when
david
stopped
playing
some
time
later
only
the
woman
sat
watching
him
the
man
was
over
at
his
desk
pen
in
hand
john
john
wife
and
john
boy
came
the
day
before
christmas
and
great
was
the
excitement
in
the
holly
farmhouse
john
was
found
to
be
big
strong
and
bronzed
with
the
outdoor
life
of
many
a
sketching
trip
a
son
to
be
proud
of
and
to
be
leaned
upon
in
one
old
age
john
according
to
perry
larson
was
the
slickest
little
woman
goin
according
to
john
mother
she
was
an
almost
unbelievable
incarnation
of
a
daughter
sweet
lovable
and
charmingly
beautiful
little
john
little
john
was
himself
and
he
could
not
have
been
more
had
he
been
an
straight
from
heaven
which
in
fact
he
was
in
his
doting
grandparents
eyes
john
holly
had
been
at
his
old
home
less
than
four
hours
when
he
chanced
upon
david
violin
he
was
with
his
father
and
mother
at
the
time
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
his
parents
he
picked
up
the
instrument
john
holly
had
not
forgotten
his
own
youth
his
in
the
old
days
had
not
been
welcome
he
remembered
a
fiddle
who
plays
he
asked
david
oh
the
boy
you
say
you
took
him
in
by
the
way
what
an
odd
little
shaver
he
is
never
did
i
see
a
boy
like
him
simeon
holly
head
came
up
almost
aggressively
david
is
a
good
boy
a
very
good
boy
indeed
john
we
think
a
great
deal
of
him
john
holly
laughed
lightly
yet
his
brow
carried
a
puzzled
frown
two
things
john
holly
had
not
been
able
thus
far
to
understand
an
indefinable
change
in
his
father
and
the
position
of
the
boy
david
in
the
household
john
holly
was
still
remembering
his
own
repressed
youth
he
murmured
softly
picking
the
strings
then
drawing
across
them
a
tentative
bow
i
a
fiddle
at
home
that
i
play
sometimes
do
you
mind
if
i
tune
her
up
a
flicker
of
something
that
was
very
near
to
humor
flashed
from
his
father
eyes
oh
no
we
are
used
to
that
now
and
again
john
holly
remembered
his
youth
jove
but
he
got
the
dandy
instrument
here
cried
the
player
dropping
his
bow
after
the
first
superbly
vibrant
tones
and
carrying
the
violin
to
the
window
a
moment
later
he
gave
an
amazed
ejaculation
and
turned
on
his
father
a
dumfounded
face
great
scott
father
where
did
that
boy
get
this
instrument
i
know
something
of
violins
if
i
ca
play
them
much
and
this
where
did
he
get
it
of
his
father
i
suppose
he
had
it
when
he
came
here
anyway
it
when
he
came
but
father
you
said
he
was
a
tramp
and
oh
come
tell
me
what
is
the
secret
behind
this
here
i
come
home
and
find
calmly
reposing
on
my
father
table
a
violin
priceless
for
all
i
know
anyhow
i
do
know
that
its
value
is
reckoned
in
the
thousands
not
hundreds
and
yet
you
with
equal
calmness
tell
me
it
owned
by
this
boy
who
it
safe
to
say
does
know
how
to
play
sixteen
notes
on
it
correctly
to
say
nothing
of
appreciating
those
he
does
play
and
who
by
your
own
account
is
nothing
but
a
swiftly
uplifted
hand
of
warning
stayed
the
words
on
his
lips
he
turned
to
see
david
himself
in
the
doorway
come
in
david
said
simeon
holly
quietly
my
son
wants
to
hear
you
play
i
do
think
he
has
heard
you
and
again
there
flashed
from
simeon
holly
eyes
a
something
very
much
like
humor
with
obvious
hesitation
john
holly
relinquished
the
violin
from
the
expression
on
his
face
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
the
sort
of
torture
he
deemed
was
before
him
but
as
if
constrained
to
ask
the
question
he
did
say
where
did
you
get
this
violin
boy
i
do
know
we
always
had
it
ever
since
i
could
remember
this
and
the
other
one
the
other
one
father
oh
he
hesitated
then
a
little
severely
he
observed
this
is
a
fine
instrument
boy
a
very
fine
instrument
yes
nodded
david
with
a
cheerful
smile
father
said
it
was
i
like
it
too
this
is
an
amati
but
the
other
is
a
stradivarius
i
know
which
i
do
like
best
sometimes
only
this
is
mine
with
a
ejaculation
john
holly
fell
back
limply
then
you
do
know
he
challenged
know
what
the
value
of
that
violin
in
your
hands
there
was
no
answer
the
boy
eyes
were
questioning
the
worth
i
mean
what
it
worth
why
no
yes
that
is
it
worth
everything
to
me
answered
david
in
a
puzzled
voice
with
an
impatient
gesture
john
holly
brushed
this
aside
but
the
other
one
where
is
that
at
joe
glaspell
i
gave
it
to
him
to
play
on
because
he
had
any
and
he
liked
to
play
so
well
you
gave
it
to
him
a
stradivarius
i
loaned
it
to
him
corrected
david
in
a
troubled
voice
being
father
i
could
bear
to
give
it
away
but
joe
joe
had
to
have
something
to
play
on
to
play
on
father
he
does
mean
the
river
street
glaspells
cried
john
holly
i
think
he
does
joe
is
old
peleg
glaspell
grandson
john
holly
threw
up
both
his
hands
a
stradivarius
to
old
peleg
grandson
oh
ye
gods
he
muttered
well
i
be
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
at
another
word
from
simeon
holly
david
had
begun
to
play
from
his
seat
by
the
stove
simeon
holly
watched
his
son
face
and
smiled
he
saw
amazement
unbelief
and
delight
struggle
for
the
mastery
but
before
the
playing
had
ceased
he
was
summoned
by
perry
larson
to
the
kitchen
on
a
matter
of
business
so
it
was
into
the
kitchen
that
john
holly
burst
a
little
later
eyes
and
cheek
aflame
father
where
in
heaven
name
did
you
get
that
boy
he
demanded
who
taught
him
to
play
like
that
i
been
trying
to
find
out
from
him
but
i
defy
sherlock
holmes
himself
to
make
head
or
tail
of
the
sort
of
lingo
he
talks
about
mountain
homes
and
the
orchestra
of
life
father
what
does
it
mean
obediently
simeon
holly
told
the
story
then
more
fully
than
he
had
told
it
before
he
brought
forward
the
letter
too
with
its
mysterious
signature
perhaps
you
can
make
it
out
son
he
laughed
none
of
the
rest
of
us
can
though
i
have
shown
it
to
anybody
now
for
a
long
time
i
got
discouraged
long
ago
of
anybody
ever
making
it
out
make
it
out
make
it
out
cried
john
holly
excitedly
i
should
say
i
could
it
a
name
known
the
world
over
it
the
name
of
one
of
the
greatest
violinists
that
ever
lived
but
how
what
how
came
he
in
my
barn
demanded
simeon
holly
easily
guessed
from
the
letter
and
from
what
the
world
knows
returned
john
his
voice
still
shaking
with
excitement
he
was
always
a
queer
chap
they
say
and
full
of
his
notions
six
or
eight
years
ago
his
wife
died
they
say
he
worshiped
her
and
for
weeks
refused
even
to
touch
his
violin
then
very
suddenly
he
with
his
son
disappeared
dropped
quite
out
of
sight
some
people
guessed
the
reason
i
knew
a
man
who
was
well
acquainted
with
him
and
at
the
time
of
the
disappearance
he
told
me
quite
a
lot
about
him
he
said
he
was
a
bit
surprised
at
what
had
happened
that
already
half
a
dozen
relatives
were
interfering
with
the
way
he
wanted
to
bring
the
boy
up
and
that
david
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
spoiled
even
then
with
so
much
attention
and
flattery
the
father
had
determined
to
make
a
wonderful
artist
of
his
son
and
he
was
known
to
have
said
that
he
believed
as
do
so
many
others
that
the
first
dozen
years
of
a
child
life
are
the
making
of
the
man
and
that
if
he
could
have
the
boy
to
himself
that
long
he
would
risk
the
rest
so
it
seems
he
carried
out
his
notion
until
he
was
taken
sick
and
had
to
quit
poor
chap
but
why
did
he
tell
us
plainly
in
that
note
who
he
was
then
fumed
simeon
holly
in
manifest
irritation
he
did
he
thought
laughed
the
other
he
signed
his
name
and
he
supposed
that
was
so
well
known
that
just
to
mention
it
would
be
enough
that
why
he
kept
it
so
secret
while
he
was
living
on
the
mountain
you
see
and
that
why
even
david
himself
did
know
it
of
course
if
anybody
found
out
who
he
was
that
ended
his
scheme
and
he
knew
it
so
he
supposed
all
he
had
to
do
at
the
last
was
to
sign
his
name
to
that
note
and
everybody
would
know
who
he
was
and
david
would
at
once
be
sent
to
his
own
people
there
an
aunt
and
some
cousins
i
believe
you
see
he
did
reckon
on
nobody
being
able
to
read
his
name
besides
being
so
ill
he
probably
was
quite
sane
anyway
i
see
i
see
nodded
simeon
holly
frowning
a
little
and
of
course
if
we
had
made
it
out
some
of
us
here
would
have
known
it
probably
now
that
you
call
it
to
mind
i
think
i
have
heard
it
myself
in
days
gone
by
though
such
names
mean
little
to
me
but
doubtless
somebody
would
have
known
however
that
is
all
past
and
gone
now
oh
yes
and
no
harm
done
he
fell
into
good
hands
luckily
soon
see
the
last
of
him
now
of
course
last
of
him
oh
no
i
shall
keep
david
said
simeon
holly
with
decision
keep
him
why
father
you
forget
who
he
is
there
are
friends
relatives
an
adoring
public
and
a
mint
of
money
awaiting
that
boy
you
ca
keep
him
you
could
never
have
kept
him
this
long
if
this
little
town
of
yours
had
been
buried
in
this
forgotten
valley
up
among
these
hills
you
have
the
whole
world
at
your
doors
the
minute
they
find
out
he
is
here
hills
or
no
hills
besides
there
are
his
people
they
have
some
claim
there
was
no
answer
with
a
suddenly
old
drawn
look
on
his
face
the
elder
man
had
turned
away
half
an
hour
later
simeon
holly
climbed
the
stairs
to
david
room
and
as
gently
and
plainly
as
he
could
told
the
boy
of
this
great
good
thing
that
had
come
to
him
david
was
amazed
but
overjoyed
that
he
was
found
to
be
the
son
of
a
famous
man
affected
him
not
at
all
only
so
far
as
it
seemed
to
set
his
father
right
in
other
eyes
in
david
own
the
man
had
always
been
supreme
but
the
going
away
the
marvelous
going
away
filled
him
with
excited
wonder
you
mean
i
shall
go
away
and
study
practice
learn
more
of
my
violin
yes
david
and
hear
beautiful
music
like
the
organ
in
church
only
more
bigger
better
i
suppose
and
know
people
dear
people
who
will
understand
what
i
say
when
i
play
simeon
holly
face
paled
a
little
still
he
knew
david
had
not
meant
to
make
it
so
hard
yes
why
it
my
just
what
i
was
going
to
have
with
the
cried
david
joyously
then
uttering
a
sharp
cry
of
consternation
he
clapped
his
fingers
to
his
lips
your
what
asked
the
man
n
nothing
really
holly
uncle
simeon
n
nothing
something
either
the
boy
agitation
or
the
luckless
mention
of
the
sent
a
sudden
dismayed
suspicion
into
simeon
holly
eyes
your
the
david
what
do
you
mean
david
shook
his
head
he
did
not
intend
to
tell
but
gently
persistently
simeon
holly
questioned
until
the
whole
piteous
little
tale
lay
bare
before
him
the
hopes
the
house
of
dreams
the
sacrifice
david
saw
then
what
it
means
when
a
strong
man
is
shaken
by
an
emotion
that
has
mastered
him
and
the
sight
awed
and
frightened
the
boy
holly
is
it
because
i
going
that
you
care
so
much
i
never
thought
or
supposed
you
care
he
faltered
there
was
no
answer
simeon
holly
eyes
were
turned
quite
away
uncle
simeon
please
i
i
think
i
do
want
to
go
anyway
i
sure
i
do
want
to
go
and
leave
you
simeon
holly
turned
then
and
spoke
go
of
course
you
go
david
do
you
think
i
tie
you
here
to
me
now
he
choked
what
do
i
owe
to
you
home
son
happiness
go
of
course
you
go
i
wonder
if
you
really
think
i
let
you
stay
come
we
go
down
to
mother
and
tell
her
i
suspect
she
want
to
start
in
to
get
your
socks
all
mended
up
and
with
head
erect
and
a
determined
step
simeon
holly
faced
the
mighty
sacrifice
in
his
turn
and
led
the
way
downstairs
the
friends
the
relatives
the
adoring
public
the
mint
of
money
they
are
all
david
now
but
once
each
year
man
grown
though
he
is
he
picks
up
his
violin
and
journeys
to
a
little
village
far
up
among
the
hills
there
in
a
quiet
kitchen
he
plays
to
an
old
man
and
an
old
woman
and
always
to
himself
he
says
that
he
is
practicing
against
the
time
when
his
violin
at
his
chin
and
the
bow
drawn
across
the
strings
he
shall
go
to
meet
his
father
in
the
land
and
tell
him
of
the
beautiful
world
he
has
left
