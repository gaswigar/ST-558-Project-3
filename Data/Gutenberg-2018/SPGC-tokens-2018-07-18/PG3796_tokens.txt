i
glen
notes
and
other
matters
it
was
a
warm
lovable
afternoon
in
the
big
at
ingleside
susan
baker
sat
down
with
a
certain
grim
satisfaction
hovering
about
her
like
an
aura
it
was
four
and
susan
who
had
been
working
incessantly
since
six
that
morning
felt
that
she
had
fairly
earned
an
hour
of
repose
and
gossip
susan
just
then
was
perfectly
happy
everything
had
gone
almost
uncannily
well
in
the
kitchen
that
day
jekyll
had
not
been
hyde
and
so
had
not
grated
on
her
nerves
from
where
she
sat
she
could
see
the
pride
of
her
heart
the
bed
of
peonies
of
her
own
planting
and
culture
blooming
as
no
other
peony
plot
in
glen
mary
ever
did
or
could
bloom
with
peonies
crimson
peonies
silvery
pink
peonies
white
as
drifts
of
winter
snow
susan
had
on
a
new
black
silk
blouse
quite
as
elaborate
as
anything
marshall
elliott
ever
wore
and
a
white
starched
apron
trimmed
with
complicated
crocheted
lace
fully
five
inches
wide
not
to
mention
insertion
to
match
therefore
susan
had
all
the
comfortable
consciousness
of
a
woman
as
she
opened
her
copy
of
the
daily
enterprise
and
prepared
to
read
the
glen
notes
which
as
miss
cornelia
had
just
informed
her
filled
half
a
column
of
it
and
mentioned
almost
everybody
at
ingleside
there
was
a
big
black
headline
on
the
front
page
of
the
enterprise
stating
that
some
archduke
ferdinand
or
other
had
been
assassinated
at
a
place
bearing
the
weird
name
of
sarajevo
but
susan
tarried
not
over
uninteresting
immaterial
stuff
like
that
she
was
in
quest
of
something
really
vital
oh
here
it
was
jottings
from
glen
st
mary
susan
settled
down
keenly
reading
each
one
over
aloud
to
extract
all
possible
gratification
from
it
blythe
and
her
visitor
miss
cornelia
alias
marshall
elliott
were
chatting
together
near
the
open
door
that
led
to
the
veranda
through
which
a
cool
delicious
breeze
was
blowing
bringing
whiffs
of
phantom
perfume
from
the
garden
and
charming
gay
echoes
from
the
corner
where
rilla
and
miss
oliver
and
walter
were
laughing
and
talking
wherever
rilla
blythe
was
there
was
laughter
there
was
another
occupant
of
the
curled
up
on
a
couch
who
must
not
be
overlooked
since
he
was
a
creature
of
marked
individuality
and
moreover
had
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
living
thing
whom
susan
really
hated
all
cats
are
mysterious
but
hyde
doc
for
short
was
trebly
so
he
was
a
cat
of
double
personality
or
else
as
susan
vowed
he
was
possessed
by
the
devil
to
begin
with
there
had
been
something
uncanny
about
the
very
dawn
of
his
existence
four
years
previously
rilla
blythe
had
had
a
treasured
darling
of
a
kitten
white
as
snow
with
a
saucy
black
tip
to
its
tail
which
she
called
jack
frost
susan
disliked
jack
frost
though
she
could
not
or
would
not
give
any
valid
reason
therefor
take
my
word
for
it
dear
she
was
wont
to
say
ominously
that
cat
will
come
to
no
good
but
why
do
you
think
so
blythe
would
ask
i
do
not
think
i
know
was
all
the
answer
susan
would
vouchsafe
with
the
rest
of
the
ingleside
folk
jack
frost
was
a
favourite
he
was
so
very
clean
and
well
groomed
and
never
allowed
a
spot
or
stain
to
be
seen
on
his
beautiful
white
suit
he
had
endearing
ways
of
purring
and
snuggling
he
was
scrupulously
honest
and
then
a
domestic
tragedy
took
place
at
ingleside
jack
frost
had
kittens
it
would
be
vain
to
try
to
picture
susan
triumph
had
she
not
always
insisted
that
that
cat
would
turn
out
to
be
a
delusion
and
a
snare
now
they
could
see
for
themselves
rilla
kept
one
of
the
kittens
a
very
pretty
one
with
peculiarly
sleek
glossy
fur
of
a
dark
yellow
crossed
by
orange
stripes
and
large
satiny
golden
ears
she
called
it
goldie
and
the
name
seemed
appropriate
enough
to
the
little
frolicsome
creature
which
during
its
kittenhood
gave
no
indication
of
the
sinister
nature
it
really
possessed
susan
of
course
warned
the
family
that
no
good
could
be
expected
from
any
offspring
of
that
diabolical
jack
frost
but
croakings
were
unheeded
the
blythes
had
been
so
accustomed
to
regard
jack
frost
as
a
member
of
the
male
sex
that
they
could
not
get
out
of
the
habit
so
they
continually
used
the
masculine
pronoun
although
the
result
was
ludicrous
visitors
used
to
be
quite
electrified
when
rilla
referred
casually
to
jack
and
his
kitten
or
told
goldie
sternly
go
to
your
mother
and
get
him
to
wash
your
fur
it
is
not
decent
dear
poor
susan
would
say
bitterly
she
herself
compromised
by
always
referring
to
jack
as
it
or
the
white
beast
and
one
heart
at
least
did
not
ache
when
it
was
accidentally
poisoned
the
following
winter
in
a
year
time
goldie
became
so
manifestly
an
inadequate
name
for
the
orange
kitten
that
walter
who
was
just
then
reading
story
changed
it
to
hyde
in
his
jekyll
mood
the
cat
was
a
drowsy
affectionate
domestic
puss
who
liked
petting
and
gloried
in
being
nursed
and
patted
especially
did
he
love
to
lie
on
his
back
and
have
his
sleek
throat
stroked
gently
while
he
purred
in
somnolent
satisfaction
he
was
a
notable
purrer
never
had
there
been
an
ingleside
cat
who
purred
so
constantly
and
so
ecstatically
the
only
thing
i
envy
a
cat
is
its
purr
remarked
blythe
once
listening
to
doc
resonant
melody
it
is
the
most
contented
sound
in
the
world
doc
was
very
handsome
his
every
movement
was
grace
his
poses
magnificent
when
he
folded
his
long
tail
about
his
feet
and
sat
him
down
on
the
veranda
to
gaze
steadily
into
space
for
long
intervals
the
blythes
felt
that
an
egyptian
sphinx
could
not
have
made
a
more
fitting
deity
of
the
portal
when
the
hyde
mood
came
upon
him
which
it
invariably
did
before
rain
or
wind
he
was
a
wild
thing
with
changed
eyes
the
transformation
always
came
suddenly
he
would
spring
fiercely
from
a
reverie
with
a
savage
snarl
and
bite
at
any
restraining
or
caressing
hand
his
fur
seemed
to
grow
darker
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
a
diabolical
light
there
was
really
an
unearthly
beauty
about
him
if
the
change
happened
in
the
twilight
all
the
ingleside
folk
felt
a
certain
terror
of
him
at
such
times
he
was
a
fearsome
beast
and
only
rilla
defended
him
asserting
that
he
was
such
a
nice
prowly
cat
certainly
he
prowled
jekyll
loved
new
milk
hyde
would
not
touch
milk
and
growled
over
his
meat
jekyll
came
down
the
stairs
so
silently
that
no
one
could
hear
him
hyde
made
his
tread
as
heavy
as
a
man
several
evenings
when
susan
was
alone
in
the
house
he
scared
her
stiff
as
she
declared
by
doing
this
he
would
sit
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
floor
with
his
terrible
eyes
fixed
unwinkingly
upon
hers
for
an
hour
at
a
time
this
played
havoc
with
her
nerves
but
poor
susan
really
held
him
in
too
much
awe
to
try
to
drive
him
out
once
she
had
dared
to
throw
a
stick
at
him
and
he
had
promptly
made
a
savage
leap
towards
her
susan
rushed
out
of
doors
and
never
attempted
to
meddle
with
hyde
again
though
she
visited
his
misdeeds
upon
the
innocent
jekyll
chasing
him
ignominiously
out
of
her
domain
whenever
he
dared
to
poke
his
nose
in
and
denying
him
certain
savoury
tidbits
for
which
he
yearned
many
friends
of
miss
faith
meredith
gerald
meredith
and
james
blythe
read
susan
rolling
the
names
like
sweet
morsels
under
her
tongue
very
much
pleased
to
welcome
them
home
a
few
weeks
ago
from
redmond
college
james
blythe
who
was
graduated
in
arts
in
had
just
completed
his
first
year
in
medicine
faith
meredith
has
really
got
to
be
the
most
handsomest
creature
i
ever
saw
commented
miss
cornelia
above
her
filet
crochet
amazing
how
those
children
came
on
after
rosemary
west
went
to
the
manse
people
have
almost
forgotten
what
imps
of
mischief
they
were
once
anne
dearie
will
you
ever
forget
the
way
they
used
to
carry
on
it
really
surprising
how
well
rosemary
got
on
with
them
she
more
like
a
chum
than
a
they
all
love
her
and
una
adores
her
as
for
that
little
bruce
una
just
makes
a
perfect
slave
of
herself
to
him
of
course
he
is
a
darling
but
did
you
ever
see
any
child
look
as
much
like
an
aunt
as
he
looks
like
his
aunt
ellen
he
just
as
dark
and
just
as
emphatic
i
ca
see
a
feature
of
rosemary
in
him
norman
douglas
always
vows
at
the
top
of
his
voice
that
the
stork
meant
bruce
for
him
and
ellen
and
took
him
to
the
manse
by
mistake
bruce
adores
jem
said
mrs
blythe
when
he
comes
over
here
he
follows
jem
about
silently
like
a
faithful
little
dog
looking
up
at
him
from
under
his
black
brows
he
would
do
anything
for
jem
i
verily
believe
are
jem
and
faith
going
to
make
a
match
of
it
blythe
smiled
it
was
well
known
that
miss
cornelia
who
had
been
such
a
virulent
at
one
time
had
actually
taken
to
in
her
declining
years
they
are
only
good
friends
yet
miss
cornelia
very
good
friends
believe
me
said
miss
cornelia
emphatically
i
hear
all
about
the
doings
of
the
young
fry
i
have
no
doubt
that
mary
vance
sees
that
you
do
marshall
elliott
said
susan
significantly
but
i
think
it
is
a
shame
to
talk
about
children
making
matches
children
jem
is
and
faith
is
nineteen
retorted
miss
cornelia
you
must
not
forget
susan
that
we
old
folks
are
not
the
only
people
in
the
world
outraged
susan
who
detested
any
reference
to
her
age
not
from
vanity
but
from
a
haunting
dread
that
people
might
come
to
think
her
too
old
to
work
returned
to
her
notes
meredith
and
shirley
blythe
came
home
last
friday
evening
from
queen
academy
we
understand
that
carl
will
be
in
charge
of
the
school
at
harbour
head
next
year
and
we
are
sure
he
will
be
a
popular
and
successful
teacher
he
will
teach
the
children
all
there
is
to
know
about
bugs
anyhow
said
miss
cornelia
he
is
through
with
queen
now
and
meredith
and
rosemary
wanted
him
to
go
right
on
to
redmond
in
the
fall
but
carl
has
a
very
independent
streak
in
him
and
means
to
earn
part
of
his
own
way
through
college
he
be
all
the
better
for
it
blythe
who
has
been
teaching
for
the
past
two
years
at
lowbridge
has
resigned
read
susan
intends
going
to
redmond
this
fall
is
walter
quite
strong
enough
for
redmond
yet
queried
miss
cornelia
anxiously
we
hope
that
he
will
be
by
the
fall
said
blythe
an
idle
summer
in
the
open
air
and
sunshine
will
do
a
great
deal
for
him
typhoid
is
a
hard
thing
to
get
over
said
miss
cornelia
emphatically
especially
when
one
has
had
such
a
close
shave
as
walter
had
i
think
he
do
well
to
stay
out
of
college
another
year
but
then
he
so
ambitious
are
di
and
nan
going
too
yes
they
both
wanted
to
teach
another
year
but
gilbert
thinks
they
had
better
go
to
redmond
this
fall
i
glad
of
that
they
keep
an
eye
on
walter
and
see
that
he
does
study
too
hard
i
suppose
continued
miss
cornelia
with
a
side
glance
at
susan
that
after
the
snub
i
got
a
few
minutes
ago
it
will
not
be
safe
for
me
to
suggest
that
jerry
meredith
is
making
sheep
eyes
at
nan
susan
ignored
this
and
blythe
laughed
again
dear
miss
cornelia
i
have
my
hands
full
have
i
with
all
these
boys
and
girls
sweethearting
around
me
if
i
took
it
seriously
it
would
quite
crush
me
but
i
do
it
is
too
hard
yet
to
realize
that
grown
up
when
i
look
at
those
two
tall
sons
of
mine
i
wonder
if
they
can
possibly
be
the
fat
sweet
dimpled
babies
i
kissed
and
cuddled
and
sang
to
slumber
the
other
day
only
the
other
day
miss
cornelia
was
jem
the
dearest
baby
in
the
old
house
of
dreams
and
now
he
a
and
accused
of
courting
we
all
growing
older
sighed
miss
cornelia
the
only
part
of
me
that
feels
old
said
blythe
is
the
ankle
i
broke
when
josie
pye
dared
me
to
walk
the
barry
in
the
green
gables
days
i
have
an
ache
in
it
when
the
wind
is
east
i
wo
admit
that
it
is
rheumatism
but
it
does
ache
as
for
the
children
they
and
the
merediths
are
planning
a
gay
summer
before
they
have
to
go
back
to
studies
in
the
fall
they
are
such
a
little
crowd
they
keep
this
house
in
a
perpetual
whirl
of
merriment
is
rilla
going
to
queen
when
shirley
goes
back
it
is
decided
yet
i
rather
fancy
not
her
father
thinks
she
is
not
quite
strong
enough
she
has
rather
outgrown
her
strength
she
really
absurdly
tall
for
a
girl
not
yet
fifteen
i
am
not
anxious
to
have
her
go
why
it
would
be
terrible
not
to
have
a
single
one
of
my
babies
home
with
me
next
winter
susan
and
i
would
fall
to
fighting
with
each
other
to
break
the
monotony
susan
smiled
at
this
pleasantry
the
idea
of
her
fighting
with
dr
dear
does
rilla
herself
want
to
go
asked
miss
cornelia
no
the
truth
is
rilla
is
the
only
one
of
my
flock
who
ambitious
i
really
wish
she
had
a
little
more
ambition
she
has
no
serious
ideals
at
all
her
sole
aspiration
seems
to
be
to
have
a
good
time
and
why
should
she
not
have
it
dr
dear
cried
susan
who
could
not
bear
to
hear
a
single
word
against
anyone
of
the
ingleside
folk
even
from
one
of
themselves
a
young
girl
should
have
a
good
time
and
that
i
will
maintain
there
will
be
time
enough
for
her
to
think
of
latin
and
greek
i
should
like
to
see
a
little
sense
of
responsibility
in
her
susan
and
you
know
yourself
that
she
is
abominably
vain
she
has
something
to
be
vain
about
retorted
susan
she
is
the
prettiest
girl
in
glen
mary
do
you
think
that
all
those
macallisters
and
crawfords
and
elliotts
could
scare
up
a
skin
like
rilla
in
four
generations
they
could
not
no
dear
i
know
my
place
but
i
can
not
allow
you
to
run
down
rilla
listen
to
this
marshall
elliott
susan
had
found
a
chance
to
get
square
with
miss
cornelia
for
her
digs
at
the
children
love
affairs
she
read
the
item
with
gusto
douglas
has
decided
not
to
go
west
he
says
old
is
good
enough
for
him
and
he
will
continue
to
farm
for
his
aunt
alec
davis
susan
looked
keenly
at
miss
cornelia
i
have
heard
marshall
elliott
that
miller
is
courting
mary
vance
this
shot
pierced
miss
cornelia
armour
her
sonsy
face
flushed
i
wo
have
miller
douglas
hanging
round
mary
she
said
crisply
he
comes
of
a
low
family
his
father
was
a
sort
of
outcast
from
the
douglases
they
never
really
counted
him
in
and
his
mother
was
one
of
those
terrible
dillons
from
the
harbour
head
i
think
i
have
heard
marshall
elliott
that
mary
vance
own
parents
were
not
what
you
could
call
aristocratic
mary
vance
has
had
a
good
bringing
up
and
she
is
a
smart
clever
capable
girl
retorted
miss
cornelia
she
is
not
going
to
throw
herself
away
on
miller
douglas
believe
me
she
knows
my
opinion
on
the
matter
and
mary
has
never
disobeyed
me
yet
well
i
do
not
think
you
need
worry
marshall
elliott
for
alec
davis
is
as
much
against
it
as
you
could
be
and
says
no
nephew
of
hers
is
ever
going
to
marry
a
nameless
nobody
like
mary
vance
susan
returned
to
her
mutton
feeling
that
she
had
got
the
best
of
it
in
this
passage
of
arms
and
read
another
note
are
pleased
to
hear
that
miss
oliver
has
been
engaged
as
teacher
for
another
year
miss
oliver
will
spend
her
vacation
at
her
home
in
lowbridge
i
so
glad
gertrude
is
going
to
stay
said
blythe
we
would
miss
her
horribly
and
she
has
an
excellent
influence
over
rilla
who
worships
her
they
are
chums
in
spite
of
the
difference
in
their
ages
i
thought
i
heard
she
was
going
to
be
married
i
believe
it
was
talked
of
but
i
understand
it
is
postponed
for
a
year
who
is
the
young
man
robert
grant
he
is
a
young
lawyer
in
charlottetown
i
hope
gertrude
will
be
happy
she
has
had
a
sad
life
with
much
bitterness
in
it
and
she
feels
things
with
a
terrible
keenness
her
first
youth
is
gone
and
she
is
practically
alone
in
the
world
this
new
love
that
has
come
into
her
life
seems
such
a
wonderful
thing
to
her
that
i
think
she
hardly
dares
believe
in
its
permanence
when
her
marriage
had
to
be
put
off
she
was
quite
in
despair
though
it
certainly
was
grant
fault
there
were
complications
in
the
settlement
of
his
father
estate
his
father
died
last
winter
and
he
could
not
marry
till
the
tangles
were
unravelled
but
i
think
gertrude
felt
it
was
a
bad
omen
and
that
her
happiness
would
somehow
elude
her
yet
it
does
not
do
dear
to
set
your
affections
too
much
on
a
man
remarked
susan
solemnly
grant
is
quite
as
much
in
love
with
gertrude
as
she
is
with
him
susan
it
is
not
he
whom
she
distrusts
it
is
fate
she
has
a
little
mystic
streak
in
her
i
suppose
some
people
would
call
her
superstitious
she
has
an
odd
belief
in
dreams
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
laugh
it
out
of
her
i
must
own
too
that
some
of
her
dreams
but
there
it
would
not
do
to
let
gilbert
hear
me
hinting
such
heresy
what
have
you
found
of
much
interest
susan
susan
had
given
an
exclamation
listen
to
this
dear
sophia
crawford
has
given
up
her
house
at
lowbridge
and
will
make
her
home
in
future
with
her
niece
albert
crawford
why
that
is
my
own
cousin
sophia
dear
we
quarrelled
when
we
were
children
over
who
should
get
a
card
with
the
words
is
love
wreathed
in
rosebuds
on
it
and
have
never
spoken
to
each
other
since
and
now
she
is
coming
to
live
right
across
the
road
from
us
you
will
have
to
make
up
the
old
quarrel
susan
it
will
never
do
to
be
at
outs
with
your
neighbours
cousin
sophia
began
the
quarrel
so
she
can
begin
the
making
up
also
dear
said
susan
loftily
if
she
does
i
hope
i
am
a
good
enough
christian
to
meet
her
she
is
not
a
cheerful
person
and
has
been
a
wet
blanket
all
her
life
the
last
time
i
saw
her
her
face
had
a
thousand
wrinkles
maybe
more
maybe
less
from
worrying
and
foreboding
she
howled
dreadful
at
her
first
husband
funeral
but
she
married
again
in
less
than
a
year
the
next
note
i
see
describes
the
special
service
in
our
church
last
sunday
night
and
says
the
decorations
were
very
beautiful
speaking
of
that
reminds
me
that
pryor
strongly
disapproves
of
flowers
in
church
said
miss
cornelia
i
always
said
there
would
be
trouble
when
that
man
moved
here
from
lowbridge
he
should
never
have
been
put
in
as
elder
it
was
a
mistake
and
we
shall
live
to
rue
it
believe
me
i
have
heard
that
he
has
said
that
if
the
girls
continue
to
up
the
pulpit
with
weeds
that
he
will
not
go
to
church
the
church
got
on
very
well
before
old
came
to
the
glen
and
it
is
my
opinion
it
will
get
on
without
him
after
he
is
gone
said
susan
who
in
the
world
ever
gave
him
that
ridiculous
nickname
asked
blythe
why
the
lowbridge
boys
have
called
him
that
ever
since
i
can
remember
dear
i
suppose
because
his
face
is
so
round
and
red
with
that
fringe
of
sandy
whisker
about
it
it
does
not
do
for
anyone
to
call
him
that
in
his
hearing
though
and
that
you
may
tie
to
but
worse
than
his
whiskers
dear
he
is
a
very
unreasonable
man
and
has
a
great
many
queer
ideas
he
is
an
elder
now
and
they
say
he
is
very
religious
but
i
can
well
remember
the
time
dear
twenty
years
ago
when
he
was
caught
pasturing
his
cow
in
the
lowbridge
graveyard
yes
indeed
i
have
not
forgotten
that
and
i
always
think
of
it
when
he
is
praying
in
meeting
well
that
is
all
the
notes
and
there
is
not
much
else
in
the
paper
of
any
importance
i
never
take
much
interest
in
foreign
parts
who
is
this
archduke
man
who
has
been
murdered
what
does
it
matter
to
us
asked
miss
cornelia
unaware
of
the
hideous
answer
to
her
question
which
destiny
was
even
then
preparing
somebody
is
always
murdering
or
being
murdered
in
those
balkan
states
it
their
normal
condition
and
i
do
really
think
that
our
papers
ought
to
print
such
shocking
things
the
enterprise
is
getting
far
too
sensational
with
its
big
headlines
well
i
must
be
getting
home
no
anne
dearie
it
no
use
asking
me
to
stay
to
supper
marshall
has
got
to
thinking
that
if
i
not
home
for
a
meal
it
not
worth
eating
just
like
a
man
so
off
i
go
merciful
goodness
anne
dearie
what
is
the
matter
with
that
cat
is
he
having
a
fit
this
as
doc
suddenly
bounded
to
the
rug
at
miss
cornelia
feet
laid
back
his
ears
swore
at
her
and
then
disappeared
with
one
fierce
leap
through
the
window
oh
no
he
merely
turning
into
hyde
which
means
that
we
shall
have
rain
or
high
wind
before
morning
doc
is
as
good
as
a
barometer
well
i
am
thankful
he
has
gone
on
the
rampage
outside
this
time
and
not
into
my
kitchen
said
susan
and
i
am
going
out
to
see
about
supper
with
such
a
crowd
as
we
have
at
ingleside
now
it
behooves
us
to
think
about
our
meals
betimes
chapter
ii
dew
of
morning
outside
the
ingleside
lawn
was
full
of
golden
pools
of
sunshine
and
plots
of
alluring
shadows
rilla
blythe
was
swinging
in
the
hammock
under
the
big
scotch
pine
gertrude
oliver
sat
at
its
roots
beside
her
and
walter
was
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
grass
lost
in
a
romance
of
chivalry
wherein
old
heroes
and
beauties
of
dead
and
gone
centuries
lived
vividly
again
for
him
rilla
was
the
baby
of
the
blythe
family
and
was
in
a
chronic
state
of
secret
indignation
because
nobody
believed
she
was
grown
up
she
was
so
nearly
fifteen
that
she
called
herself
that
and
she
was
quite
as
tall
as
di
and
nan
also
she
was
nearly
as
pretty
as
susan
believed
her
to
be
she
had
great
dreamy
hazel
eyes
a
milky
skin
dappled
with
little
golden
freckles
and
delicately
arched
eyebrows
giving
her
a
demure
questioning
look
which
made
people
especially
lads
in
their
teens
want
to
answer
it
her
hair
was
ripely
ruddily
brown
and
a
little
dent
in
her
upper
lip
looked
as
if
some
good
fairy
had
pressed
it
in
with
her
finger
at
rilla
christening
rilla
whose
best
friends
could
not
deny
her
share
of
vanity
thought
her
face
would
do
very
well
but
worried
over
her
figure
and
wished
her
mother
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
let
her
wear
longer
dresses
she
who
had
been
so
plump
and
in
the
old
rainbow
valley
days
was
incredibly
slim
now
in
the
period
jem
and
shirley
harrowed
her
soul
by
calling
her
spider
yet
she
somehow
escaped
awkwardness
there
was
something
in
her
movements
that
made
you
think
she
never
walked
but
always
danced
she
had
been
much
petted
and
was
a
wee
bit
spoiled
but
still
the
general
opinion
was
that
rilla
blythe
was
a
very
sweet
girl
even
if
she
were
not
so
clever
as
nan
and
di
miss
oliver
who
was
going
home
that
night
for
vacation
had
boarded
for
a
year
at
ingleside
the
blythes
had
taken
her
to
please
rilla
who
was
fathoms
deep
in
love
with
her
teacher
and
was
even
willing
to
share
her
room
since
no
other
was
available
gertrude
oliver
was
and
life
had
been
a
struggle
for
her
she
was
a
girl
with
rather
sad
brown
eyes
a
clever
rather
mocking
mouth
and
enormous
masses
of
black
hair
twisted
about
her
head
she
was
not
pretty
but
there
was
a
certain
charm
of
interest
and
mystery
in
her
face
and
rilla
found
her
fascinating
even
her
occasional
moods
of
gloom
and
cynicism
had
allurement
for
rilla
these
moods
came
only
when
miss
oliver
was
tired
at
all
other
times
she
was
a
stimulating
companion
and
the
gay
set
at
ingleside
never
remembered
that
she
was
so
much
older
than
themselves
walter
and
rilla
were
her
favourites
and
she
was
the
confidante
of
the
secret
wishes
and
aspirations
of
both
she
knew
that
rilla
longed
to
be
out
to
go
to
parties
as
nan
and
di
did
and
to
have
dainty
evening
dresses
and
yes
there
is
no
mincing
matters
beaux
in
the
plural
at
that
as
for
walter
miss
oliver
knew
that
he
had
written
a
sequence
of
sonnets
to
rosamond
faith
meredith
and
that
he
aimed
at
a
professorship
of
english
literature
in
some
big
college
she
knew
his
passionate
love
of
beauty
and
his
equally
passionate
hatred
of
ugliness
she
knew
his
strength
and
his
weakness
walter
was
as
ever
the
handsomest
of
the
ingleside
boys
miss
oliver
found
pleasure
in
looking
at
him
for
his
good
looks
he
was
so
exactly
like
what
she
would
have
liked
her
own
son
to
be
glossy
black
hair
brilliant
dark
grey
eyes
faultless
features
and
a
poet
to
his
fingertips
that
sonnet
sequence
was
really
a
remarkable
thing
for
a
lad
of
twenty
to
write
miss
oliver
was
no
partial
critic
and
she
knew
that
walter
blythe
had
a
wonderful
gift
rilla
loved
walter
with
all
her
heart
he
never
teased
her
as
jem
and
shirley
did
he
never
called
her
spider
his
pet
name
for
her
was
a
little
pun
on
her
real
name
marilla
she
had
been
named
after
aunt
marilla
of
green
gables
but
aunt
marilla
had
died
before
rilla
was
old
enough
to
know
her
very
well
and
rilla
detested
the
name
as
being
horribly
and
prim
why
could
they
have
called
her
by
her
first
name
bertha
which
was
beautiful
and
dignified
instead
of
that
silly
rilla
she
did
not
mind
version
but
nobody
else
was
allowed
to
call
her
that
except
miss
oliver
now
and
then
in
walter
musical
voice
sounded
very
beautiful
to
her
like
the
lilt
and
ripple
of
some
silvery
brook
she
would
have
died
for
walter
if
it
would
have
done
him
any
good
so
she
told
miss
oliver
rilla
was
as
fond
of
italics
as
most
girls
of
fifteen
are
and
the
bitterest
drop
in
her
cup
was
her
suspicion
that
he
told
di
more
of
his
secrets
than
he
told
her
he
thinks
i
not
grown
up
enough
to
understand
she
had
once
lamented
rebelliously
to
miss
oliver
but
i
am
and
i
would
never
tell
them
to
a
single
soul
not
even
to
you
miss
oliver
i
tell
you
all
my
own
i
just
could
be
happy
if
i
had
any
secret
from
you
dearest
but
i
would
never
betray
his
i
tell
him
everything
i
even
show
him
my
diary
and
it
hurts
me
dreadfully
when
he
does
tell
me
things
he
shows
me
all
his
poems
though
they
are
marvellous
miss
oliver
oh
i
just
live
in
the
hope
that
some
day
i
shall
be
to
walter
what
wordsworth
sister
dorothy
was
to
him
wordsworth
never
wrote
anything
like
walter
poems
nor
tennyson
either
i
would
say
just
that
both
of
them
wrote
a
great
deal
of
trash
said
miss
oliver
dryly
then
repenting
as
she
saw
a
hurt
look
in
rilla
eye
she
added
hastily
but
i
believe
walter
will
be
a
great
poet
too
some
day
and
you
will
have
more
of
his
confidence
as
you
grow
older
when
walter
was
in
the
hospital
with
typhoid
last
year
i
was
almost
crazy
sighed
rilla
a
little
importantly
they
never
told
me
how
ill
he
really
was
until
it
was
all
over
father
would
let
them
i
glad
i
did
know
i
could
have
borne
it
i
cried
myself
to
sleep
every
night
as
it
was
but
sometimes
concluded
rilla
bitterly
she
liked
to
speak
bitterly
now
and
then
in
imitation
of
miss
oliver
sometimes
i
think
walter
cares
more
for
dog
monday
than
he
does
for
me
dog
monday
was
the
ingleside
dog
so
called
because
he
had
come
into
the
family
on
a
monday
when
walter
had
been
reading
robinson
crusoe
he
really
belonged
to
jem
but
was
much
attached
to
walter
also
he
was
lying
beside
walter
now
with
nose
snuggled
against
his
arm
thumping
his
tail
rapturously
whenever
walter
gave
him
an
absent
pat
monday
was
not
a
collie
or
a
setter
or
a
hound
or
a
newfoundland
he
was
just
as
jem
said
plain
dog
very
plain
dog
uncharitable
people
added
certainly
monday
looks
were
not
his
strong
point
black
spots
were
scattered
at
random
over
his
yellow
carcass
one
of
them
apparently
blotting
out
an
eye
his
ears
were
in
tatters
for
monday
was
never
successful
in
affairs
of
honour
but
he
possessed
one
talisman
he
knew
that
not
all
dogs
could
be
handsome
or
eloquent
or
victorious
but
that
every
dog
could
love
inside
his
homely
hide
beat
the
most
affectionate
loyal
faithful
heart
of
any
dog
since
dogs
were
and
something
looked
out
of
his
brown
eyes
that
was
nearer
akin
to
a
soul
than
any
theologian
would
allow
everybody
at
ingleside
was
fond
of
him
even
susan
although
his
one
unfortunate
propensity
of
sneaking
into
the
spare
room
and
going
to
sleep
on
the
bed
tried
her
affection
sorely
on
this
particular
afternoon
rilla
had
no
quarrel
on
hand
with
existing
conditions
has
june
been
a
delightful
month
she
asked
looking
dreamily
afar
at
the
little
quiet
silvery
clouds
hanging
so
peacefully
over
rainbow
valley
we
had
such
lovely
times
and
such
lovely
weather
it
has
just
been
perfect
every
way
i
do
half
like
that
said
miss
oliver
with
a
sigh
ominous
somehow
a
perfect
thing
is
a
gift
of
the
gods
a
sort
of
compensation
for
what
is
coming
afterwards
i
seen
that
so
often
that
i
do
care
to
hear
people
say
they
had
a
perfect
time
june
has
been
delightful
though
of
course
it
has
been
very
exciting
said
rilla
the
only
exciting
thing
that
has
happened
in
the
glen
for
a
year
was
old
miss
mead
fainting
in
church
sometimes
i
wish
something
dramatic
would
happen
once
in
a
while
do
wish
it
dramatic
things
always
have
a
bitterness
for
some
one
what
a
nice
summer
all
you
gay
creatures
will
have
and
me
moping
at
lowbridge
you
be
over
often
wo
you
i
think
there
going
to
be
lots
of
fun
this
summer
though
i
just
be
on
the
fringe
of
things
as
usual
i
suppose
is
it
horrid
when
people
think
you
a
little
girl
when
you
not
there
plenty
of
time
for
you
to
be
grown
up
rilla
do
wish
your
youth
away
it
goes
too
quickly
you
begin
to
taste
life
soon
enough
taste
life
i
want
to
eat
it
cried
rilla
laughing
i
want
everything
everything
a
girl
can
have
i
be
fifteen
in
another
month
and
then
nobody
can
say
i
a
child
any
longer
i
heard
someone
say
once
that
the
years
from
fifteen
to
nineteen
are
the
best
years
in
a
girl
life
i
going
to
make
them
perfectly
splendid
just
fill
them
with
fun
there
no
use
thinking
about
what
you
going
to
do
you
are
tolerably
sure
not
to
do
it
oh
but
you
do
get
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
the
thinking
cried
rilla
you
think
of
nothing
but
fun
you
monkey
said
miss
oliver
indulgently
reflecting
that
rilla
chin
was
really
the
last
word
in
chins
well
what
else
is
fifteen
for
but
have
you
any
notion
of
going
to
college
this
fall
no
nor
any
other
fall
i
do
want
to
i
never
cared
for
all
those
ologies
and
isms
nan
and
di
are
so
crazy
about
and
there
five
of
us
going
to
college
already
surely
that
enough
there
bound
to
be
one
dunce
in
every
family
i
quite
willing
to
be
a
dunce
if
i
can
be
a
pretty
popular
delightful
one
i
ca
be
clever
i
have
no
talent
at
all
and
you
ca
imagine
how
comfortable
it
is
nobody
expects
me
to
do
anything
so
i
never
pestered
to
do
it
and
i
ca
be
a
housewifely
cookly
creature
either
i
hate
sewing
and
dusting
and
when
susan
could
teach
me
to
make
biscuits
nobody
could
father
says
i
toil
not
neither
do
i
spin
therefore
i
must
be
a
lily
of
the
field
concluded
rilla
with
another
laugh
you
are
too
young
to
give
up
your
studies
altogether
rilla
oh
mother
will
put
me
through
a
course
of
reading
next
winter
it
will
polish
up
her
degree
luckily
i
like
reading
do
look
at
me
so
sorrowfully
and
so
disapprovingly
dearest
i
ca
be
sober
and
serious
everything
looks
so
rosy
and
rainbowy
to
me
next
month
be
fifteen
and
next
year
sixteen
and
the
year
after
that
seventeen
could
anything
be
more
enchanting

gertrude

half
laughingly
half
seriously
rap
wood
chapter
iii
moonlit
mirth
rilla
who
still
buttoned
up
her
eyes
when
she
went
to
sleep
so
that
she
always
looked
as
if
she
were
laughing
in
her
slumber
yawned
stretched
and
smiled
at
gertrude
oliver
the
latter
had
come
over
from
lowbridge
the
previous
evening
and
had
been
prevailed
upon
to
remain
for
the
dance
at
the
four
winds
lighthouse
the
next
night
the
new
day
is
knocking
at
the
window
what
will
it
bring
us
i
wonder
miss
oliver
shivered
a
little
she
never
greeted
the
days
with
enthusiasm
she
had
lived
long
enough
to
know
that
a
day
may
bring
a
terrible
thing
i
think
the
nicest
thing
about
days
is
their
unexpectedness
went
on
rilla
it
jolly
to
wake
up
like
this
on
a
morning
and
wonder
what
surprise
packet
the
day
will
hand
you
i
always
for
ten
minutes
before
i
get
up
imagining
the
heaps
of
splendid
things
that
may
happen
before
night
i
hope
something
very
unexpected
will
happen
today
said
gertrude
i
hope
the
mail
will
bring
us
news
that
war
has
been
averted
between
germany
and
france
oh
yes
said
rilla
vaguely
it
will
be
dreadful
if
it
is
i
suppose
but
it
wo
really
matter
much
to
us
will
it
i
think
a
war
would
be
so
exciting
the
boer
war
was
they
say
but
i
do
remember
anything
about
it
of
course
miss
oliver
shall
i
wear
my
white
dress
tonight
or
my
new
green
one
the
green
one
is
by
far
the
prettier
of
course
but
i
almost
afraid
to
wear
it
to
a
shore
dance
for
fear
something
will
happen
to
it
and
will
you
do
my
hair
the
new
way
none
of
the
other
girls
in
the
glen
wear
it
yet
and
it
will
make
such
a
sensation
how
did
you
induce
your
mother
to
let
you
go
to
the
dance
oh
walter
coaxed
her
over
he
knew
i
would
be
if
i
did
go
it
my
first
party
miss
oliver
and
i
just
lain
awake
at
nights
for
a
week
thinking
it
over
when
i
saw
the
sun
shining
this
morning
i
wanted
to
whoop
for
joy
it
would
be
simply
terrible
if
it
rained
tonight
i
think
i
wear
the
green
dress
and
risk
it
i
want
to
look
my
nicest
at
my
first
party
besides
an
inch
longer
than
my
white
one
and
i
wear
my
silver
slippers
too
ford
sent
them
to
me
last
christmas
and
i
never
had
a
chance
to
wear
them
yet
they
the
dearest
things
oh
miss
oliver
i
do
hope
some
of
the
boys
will
ask
me
to
dance
i
shall
die
of
mortification
truly
i
will
if
nobody
does
and
i
have
to
sit
stuck
up
against
the
wall
all
the
evening
of
course
carl
and
jerry
ca
dance
because
they
the
minister
sons
or
else
i
could
depend
on
them
to
save
me
from
utter
disgrace
you
have
plenty
of
partners
all
the
boys
are
coming
there
be
far
more
boys
than
girls
i
glad
i
not
a
minister
daughter
laughed
rilla
poor
faith
is
so
furious
because
she
wo
dare
to
dance
tonight
una
does
care
of
course
she
has
never
hankered
after
dancing
somebody
told
faith
there
would
be
a
in
the
kitchen
for
those
who
did
dance
and
you
should
have
seen
the
face
she
made
she
and
jem
will
sit
out
on
the
rocks
most
of
the
evening
i
suppose
did
you
know
that
we
are
all
to
walk
down
as
far
as
that
little
creek
below
the
old
house
of
dreams
and
then
sail
to
the
lighthouse
wo
it
just
be
absolutely
divine
when
i
was
fifteen
i
talked
in
italics
and
superlatives
too
said
miss
oliver
sarcastically
i
think
the
party
promises
to
be
pleasant
for
young
fry
i
expect
to
be
bored
none
of
those
boys
will
bother
dancing
with
an
old
maid
like
me
jem
and
walter
will
take
me
out
once
out
of
charity
so
you
ca
expect
me
to
look
forward
to
it
with
your
touching
young
rapture
did
you
have
a
good
time
at
your
first
party
though
miss
oliver
no
i
had
a
hateful
time
i
was
shabby
and
homely
and
nobody
asked
me
to
dance
except
one
boy
homelier
and
shabbier
than
myself
he
was
so
awkward
i
hated
him
and
even
he
did
ask
me
again
i
had
no
real
girlhood
rilla
it
a
sad
loss
that
why
i
want
you
to
have
a
splendid
happy
girlhood
and
i
hope
your
first
party
will
be
one
you
remember
all
your
life
with
pleasure
i
dreamed
last
night
i
was
at
the
dance
and
right
in
the
middle
of
things
i
discovered
i
was
dressed
in
my
kimono
and
bedroom
shoes
sighed
rilla
i
woke
up
with
a
gasp
of
horror
speaking
of
dreams
i
had
an
odd
one
said
miss
oliver
absently
it
was
one
of
those
vivid
dreams
i
sometimes
have
they
are
not
the
vague
jumble
of
ordinary
dreams
they
are
as
clear
cut
and
real
as
life
what
was
your
dream
i
was
standing
on
the
veranda
steps
here
at
ingleside
looking
down
over
the
fields
of
the
glen
all
at
once
far
in
the
distance
i
saw
a
long
silvery
glistening
wave
breaking
over
them
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
just
a
succession
of
little
white
waves
like
those
that
break
on
the
sandshore
sometimes
the
glen
was
being
swallowed
up
i
thought
the
waves
will
not
come
near
ingleside
but
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
so
rapidly
before
i
could
move
or
call
they
were
breaking
right
at
my
feet
and
everything
was
gone
there
was
nothing
but
a
waste
of
stormy
water
where
the
glen
had
been
i
tried
to
draw
back
and
i
saw
that
the
edge
of
my
dress
was
wet
with
blood
and
i
woke
shivering
i
do
like
the
dream
there
was
some
sinister
significance
in
it
that
kind
of
vivid
dream
always
true
with
me
i
hope
it
does
mean
there
a
storm
coming
up
from
the
east
to
spoil
the
party
murmured
rilla
incorrigible
fifteen
said
miss
oliver
dryly
no
i
do
think
there
is
any
danger
that
it
foretells
anything
so
awful
as
that
there
had
been
an
undercurrent
of
tension
in
the
ingleside
existence
for
several
days
only
rilla
absorbed
in
her
own
budding
life
was
unaware
of
it
blythe
had
taken
to
looking
grave
and
saying
little
over
the
daily
paper
jem
and
walter
were
keenly
interested
in
the
news
it
brought
jem
sought
walter
out
in
excitement
that
evening
oh
boy
germany
has
declared
war
on
france
this
means
that
england
will
fight
too
probably
and
if
she
does
well
the
piper
of
your
old
fancy
will
have
come
at
last
it
was
a
fancy
said
walter
slowly
it
was
a
presentiment
a
vision
jem
i
really
saw
him
for
a
moment
that
evening
long
ago
suppose
england
does
fight
why
we
all
have
to
turn
in
and
help
her
cried
jem
gaily
we
could
let
the
grey
mother
of
the
northern
sea
fight
it
out
alone
could
we
but
you
ca
go
the
typhoid
has
done
you
out
of
that
sort
of
a
shame
eh
walter
did
not
say
whether
it
was
a
shame
or
not
he
looked
silently
over
the
glen
to
the
dimpling
blue
harbour
beyond
we
the
cubs
we
got
to
pitch
in
tooth
and
claw
if
it
comes
to
a
family
row
jem
went
on
cheerfully
rumpling
up
his
red
curls
with
a
strong
lean
sensitive
brown
hand
the
hand
of
the
born
surgeon
his
father
often
thought
what
an
adventure
it
would
be
but
i
suppose
grey
or
some
of
those
wary
old
chaps
will
patch
matters
up
at
the
eleventh
hour
it
be
a
rotten
shame
if
they
leave
france
in
the
lurch
though
if
they
do
we
see
some
fun
well
i
suppose
time
to
get
ready
for
the
spree
at
the
light
jem
departed
whistling
wi
a
hundred
pipers
and
a
and
a
and
walter
stood
for
a
long
time
where
he
was
there
was
a
little
frown
on
his
forehead
this
had
all
come
up
with
the
blackness
and
suddenness
of
a
thundercloud
a
few
days
ago
nobody
had
even
thought
of
such
a
thing
it
was
absurd
to
think
of
it
now
some
way
out
would
be
found
war
was
a
hellish
horrible
hideous
thing
too
horrible
and
hideous
to
happen
in
the
twentieth
century
between
civilized
nations
the
mere
thought
of
it
was
hideous
and
made
walter
unhappy
in
its
threat
to
the
beauty
of
life
he
would
not
think
of
it
he
would
resolutely
put
it
out
of
his
mind
how
beautiful
the
old
glen
was
in
its
august
ripeness
with
its
chain
of
bowery
old
homesteads
tilled
meadows
and
quiet
gardens
the
western
sky
was
like
a
great
golden
pearl
far
down
the
harbour
was
frosted
with
a
dawning
moonlight
the
air
was
full
of
exquisite
sounds
sleepy
robin
whistles
wonderful
mournful
soft
murmurs
of
wind
in
the
twilit
trees
rustle
of
aspen
poplars
talking
in
silvery
whispers
and
shaking
their
dainty
leaves
lilting
young
laughter
from
the
windows
of
rooms
where
the
girls
were
making
ready
for
the
dance
the
world
was
steeped
in
maddening
loveliness
of
sound
and
colour
he
would
think
only
of
these
things
and
of
the
deep
subtle
joy
they
gave
him
anyhow
no
one
will
expect
me
to
go
he
thought
as
jem
says
typhoid
has
seen
to
that
rilla
was
leaning
out
of
her
room
window
dressed
for
the
dance
a
yellow
pansy
slipped
from
her
hair
and
fell
out
over
the
sill
like
a
falling
star
of
gold
she
caught
at
it
vainly
but
there
were
enough
left
miss
oliver
had
woven
a
little
wreath
of
them
for
her
pet
hair
it
so
beautifully
calm
is
that
splendid
we
have
a
perfect
night
listen
miss
oliver
i
can
hear
those
old
bells
in
rainbow
valley
quite
clearly
they
been
hanging
there
for
over
ten
years
their
wind
chime
always
makes
me
think
of
the
aerial
celestial
music
adam
and
eve
heard
in
milton
eden
responded
miss
oliver
we
used
to
have
such
fun
in
rainbow
valley
when
we
were
children
said
rilla
dreamily
nobody
ever
played
in
rainbow
valley
now
it
was
very
silent
on
summer
evenings
walter
liked
to
go
there
to
read
jem
and
faith
trysted
there
considerably
jerry
and
nan
went
there
to
pursue
uninterruptedly
the
ceaseless
wrangles
and
arguments
on
profound
subjects
that
seemed
to
be
their
preferred
method
of
sweethearting
and
rilla
had
a
beloved
little
sylvan
dell
of
her
own
there
where
she
liked
to
sit
and
dream
i
must
run
down
to
the
kitchen
before
i
go
and
show
myself
off
to
susan
she
would
never
forgive
me
if
i
did
rilla
whirled
into
the
shadowy
kitchen
at
ingleside
where
susan
was
prosaically
darning
socks
and
lighted
it
up
with
her
beauty
she
wore
her
green
dress
with
its
little
pink
daisy
garlands
her
silk
stockings
and
silver
slippers
she
had
golden
pansies
in
her
hair
and
at
her
creamy
throat
she
was
so
pretty
and
young
and
glowing
that
even
cousin
sophia
crawford
was
compelled
to
admire
her
and
cousin
sophia
crawford
admired
few
transient
earthly
things
cousin
sophia
and
susan
had
made
up
or
ignored
their
old
feud
since
the
former
had
come
to
live
in
the
glen
and
cousin
sophia
often
came
across
in
the
evenings
to
make
a
neighbourly
call
susan
did
not
always
welcome
her
rapturously
for
cousin
sophia
was
not
what
could
be
called
an
exhilarating
companion
some
calls
are
visits
and
some
are
visitations
dear
susan
said
once
and
left
it
to
be
inferred
that
cousin
sophia
were
the
latter
cousin
sophia
had
a
long
pale
wrinkled
face
a
long
thin
nose
a
long
thin
mouth
and
very
long
thin
pale
hands
generally
folded
resignedly
on
her
black
calico
lap
everything
about
her
seemed
long
and
thin
and
pale
she
looked
mournfully
upon
rilla
blythe
and
said
sadly
is
your
hair
all
your
own
of
course
it
is
cried
rilla
indignantly
ah
well
cousin
sophia
sighed
it
might
be
better
for
you
if
it
was
such
a
lot
of
hair
takes
from
a
person
strength
it
a
sign
of
consumption
i
heard
but
i
hope
it
wo
turn
out
like
that
in
your
case
i
you
all
be
dancing
tonight
even
the
boys
most
likely
i
his
girls
wo
go
that
far
ah
well
i
never
held
with
dancing
i
knew
a
girl
once
who
dropped
dead
while
she
was
dancing
how
any
one
could
ever
dance
aga
after
a
judgment
like
that
i
can
not
comprehend
did
she
ever
dance
again
asked
rilla
pertly
i
told
you
she
dropped
dead
of
course
she
never
danced
again
poor
creature
she
was
a
kirke
from
lowbridge
you
ai
off
like
that
with
nothing
on
your
bare
neck
are
you
it
a
hot
evening
protested
rilla
but
i
put
on
a
scarf
when
we
go
on
the
water
i
knew
of
a
boat
load
of
young
folks
who
went
sailing
on
that
harbour
forty
years
ago
just
such
a
night
as
this
just
exactly
such
a
night
as
this
said
cousin
sophia
lugubriously
and
they
were
upset
and
drowned
every
last
one
of
them
i
hope
nothing
like
that
happen
to
you
tonight
do
you
ever
try
anything
for
the
freckles
i
used
to
find
plantain
juice
real
good
you
certainly
should
be
a
judge
of
freckles
cousin
sophia
said
susan
rushing
to
rilla
defence
you
were
more
speckled
than
any
toad
when
you
was
a
girl
rilla
only
come
in
summer
but
yours
stayed
put
season
in
and
season
out
and
you
had
not
a
ground
colour
like
hers
behind
them
neither
you
look
real
nice
rilla
and
that
way
of
fixing
your
hair
is
becoming
but
you
are
not
going
to
walk
to
the
harbour
in
those
slippers
are
you
oh
no
we
all
wear
our
old
shoes
to
the
harbour
and
carry
our
slippers
do
you
like
my
dress
susan
it
minds
me
of
a
dress
i
wore
when
i
was
a
girl
sighed
cousin
sophia
before
susan
could
reply
it
was
green
with
pink
posies
on
it
too
and
it
was
flounced
from
the
waist
to
the
hem
we
did
wear
the
skimpy
things
girls
wear
nowadays
ah
me
times
has
changed
and
not
for
the
better
i
afraid
i
tore
a
big
hole
in
it
that
night
and
someone
spilled
a
cup
of
tea
all
over
it
ruined
it
completely
but
i
hope
nothing
will
happen
to
your
dress
it
orter
to
be
a
bit
longer
thinking
your
legs
are
so
terrible
long
and
thin
blythe
does
not
approve
of
little
girls
dressing
like
ones
said
susan
stiffly
intending
merely
a
snub
to
cousin
sophia
but
rilla
felt
insulted
a
little
girl
indeed
she
whisked
out
of
the
kitchen
in
high
dudgeon
another
time
she
would
go
down
to
show
herself
off
to
susan
susan
who
thought
nobody
was
grown
up
until
she
was
sixty
and
that
horrid
cousin
sophia
with
her
digs
about
freckles
and
legs
what
business
had
an
old
an
old
beanpole
like
that
to
talk
of
anybody
else
being
long
and
thin
rilla
felt
all
her
pleasure
in
herself
and
her
evening
clouded
and
spoiled
the
very
teeth
of
her
soul
were
set
on
edge
and
she
could
have
sat
down
and
cried
but
later
on
her
spirits
rose
again
when
she
found
herself
one
of
the
gay
crowd
bound
for
the
four
winds
light
the
blythes
left
ingleside
to
the
melancholy
music
of
howls
from
dog
monday
who
was
locked
up
in
the
barn
lest
he
make
an
uninvited
guest
at
the
light
they
picked
up
the
merediths
in
the
village
and
others
joined
them
as
they
walked
down
the
old
harbour
road
mary
vance
resplendent
in
blue
crepe
with
lace
overdress
came
out
of
miss
cornelia
gate
and
attached
herself
to
rilla
and
miss
oliver
who
were
walking
together
and
who
did
not
welcome
her
rilla
was
not
very
fond
of
mary
vance
she
had
never
forgotten
the
humiliating
day
when
mary
had
chased
her
through
the
village
with
a
dried
codfish
mary
vance
to
tell
the
truth
was
not
exactly
popular
with
any
of
her
set
still
they
enjoyed
her
society
she
had
such
a
biting
tongue
that
it
was
stimulating
mary
vance
is
a
habit
of
ours
we
ca
do
without
her
even
when
we
are
furious
with
her
di
blythe
had
once
said
most
of
the
little
crowd
were
paired
off
after
a
fashion
jem
walked
with
faith
meredith
of
course
and
jerry
meredith
with
nan
blythe
di
and
walter
were
together
deep
in
confidential
conversation
which
rilla
envied
carl
meredith
was
walking
with
miranda
pryor
more
to
torment
joe
milgrave
than
for
any
other
reason
joe
was
known
to
have
a
strong
hankering
for
the
said
miranda
which
shyness
prevented
him
from
indulging
on
all
occasions
joe
might
summon
enough
courage
to
amble
up
beside
miranda
if
the
night
were
dark
but
here
in
this
moonlit
dusk
he
simply
could
not
do
it
so
he
trailed
along
after
the
procession
and
thought
things
not
lawful
to
be
uttered
of
carl
meredith
miranda
was
the
daughter
of
she
did
not
share
her
unpopularity
but
she
was
not
much
run
after
being
a
pale
neutral
little
creature
somewhat
addicted
to
nervous
giggling
she
had
silvery
blonde
hair
and
her
eyes
were
big
china
blue
orbs
that
looked
as
if
she
had
been
badly
frightened
when
she
was
little
and
had
never
got
over
it
she
would
much
rather
have
walked
with
joe
than
with
carl
with
whom
she
did
not
feel
in
the
least
at
home
yet
it
was
something
of
an
honour
too
to
have
a
college
boy
beside
her
and
a
son
of
the
manse
at
that
shirley
blythe
was
with
una
meredith
and
both
were
rather
silent
because
such
was
their
nature
shirley
was
a
lad
of
sixteen
sedate
sensible
thoughtful
full
of
a
quiet
humour
he
was
susan
little
brown
boy
yet
with
his
brown
hair
brown
eyes
and
clear
brown
skin
he
liked
to
walk
with
una
meredith
because
she
never
tried
to
make
him
talk
or
badgered
him
with
chatter
una
was
as
sweet
and
shy
as
she
had
been
in
the
rainbow
valley
days
and
her
large
eyes
were
as
dreamy
and
wistful
she
had
a
secret
fancy
for
walter
blythe
that
nobody
but
rilla
ever
suspected
rilla
sympathized
with
it
and
wished
walter
would
return
it
she
liked
una
better
than
faith
whose
beauty
and
aplomb
rather
overshadowed
other
girls
and
rilla
did
not
enjoy
being
overshadowed
but
just
now
she
was
very
happy
it
was
so
delightful
to
be
tripping
with
her
friends
down
that
dark
gleaming
road
sprinkled
with
its
little
spruces
and
firs
whose
balsam
made
all
the
air
resinous
around
them
meadows
of
sunset
afterlight
were
behind
the
westerning
hills
before
them
was
the
shining
harbour
a
bell
was
ringing
in
the
little
church
and
the
lingering
died
around
the
dim
amethystine
points
the
gulf
beyond
was
still
silvery
blue
in
the
afterlight
oh
it
was
all
glorious
the
clear
air
with
its
salt
tang
the
balsam
of
the
firs
the
laughter
of
her
friends
rilla
loved
life
its
bloom
and
brilliance
she
loved
the
ripple
of
music
the
hum
of
merry
conversation
she
wanted
to
walk
on
forever
over
this
road
of
silver
and
shadow
it
was
her
first
party
and
she
was
going
to
have
a
splendid
time
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
to
worry
about
not
even
freckles
and
legs
nothing
except
one
little
haunting
fear
that
nobody
would
ask
her
to
dance
it
was
beautiful
and
satisfying
just
to
be
alive
to
be
fifteen
to
be
pretty
rilla
drew
a
long
breath
of
rapture
and
caught
it
midway
rather
sharply
jem
was
telling
some
story
to
faith
something
that
had
happened
in
the
balkan
war
the
doctor
lost
both
his
legs
they
were
smashed
to
pulp
and
he
was
left
on
the
field
to
die
and
he
crawled
about
from
man
to
man
to
all
the
wounded
men
round
him
as
long
as
he
could
and
did
everything
possible
to
relieve
their
sufferings
never
thinking
of
himself
he
was
tying
a
bit
of
bandage
round
another
man
leg
when
he
went
under
they
found
them
there
the
doctor
dead
hands
still
held
the
bandage
tight
the
bleeding
was
stopped
and
the
other
man
life
was
saved
some
hero
was
he
faith
i
tell
you
when
i
read
that
jem
and
faith
moved
on
out
of
hearing
gertrude
oliver
suddenly
shivered
rilla
pressed
her
arm
sympathetically
was
it
dreadful
miss
oliver
i
do
know
why
jem
tells
such
gruesome
things
at
a
time
like
this
when
we
all
out
for
fun
do
you
think
it
dreadful
rilla
i
thought
it
wonderful
beautiful
such
a
story
makes
one
ashamed
of
ever
doubting
human
nature
that
man
action
was
godlike
and
how
humanity
responds
to
the
ideal
of
as
for
my
shiver
i
do
know
what
caused
it
the
evening
is
certainly
warm
enough
perhaps
someone
is
walking
over
the
dark
starshiny
spot
that
is
to
be
my
grave
that
is
the
explanation
the
old
superstition
would
give
well
i
wo
think
of
that
on
this
lovely
night
do
you
know
rilla
that
when
comes
i
always
glad
i
live
in
the
country
we
know
the
real
charm
of
night
here
as
town
dwellers
never
do
every
night
is
beautiful
in
the
country
even
the
stormy
ones
i
love
a
wild
night
storm
on
this
old
gulf
shore
as
for
a
night
like
this
it
is
almost
too
beautiful
it
belongs
to
youth
and
dreamland
and
i
half
afraid
of
it
i
feel
as
if
i
were
part
of
it
said
rilla
ah
yes
you
young
enough
not
to
be
afraid
of
perfect
things
well
here
we
are
at
the
house
of
dreams
it
seems
lonely
this
summer
the
fords
did
come
and
ford
and
persis
did
kenneth
did
but
he
stayed
with
his
mother
people
we
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
him
this
summer
he
a
little
lame
so
did
go
about
very
much
lame
what
happened
to
him
he
broke
his
ankle
in
a
football
game
last
fall
and
was
laid
up
most
of
the
winter
he
has
limped
a
little
ever
since
but
it
is
getting
better
all
the
time
and
he
expects
it
will
be
all
right
before
long
he
has
been
up
to
ingleside
only
twice
ethel
reese
is
simply
crazy
about
him
said
mary
vance
she
got
the
sense
she
was
born
with
where
he
is
concerned
he
walked
home
with
her
from
the
church
last
night
and
the
airs
she
has
put
on
since
would
really
make
you
weary
of
life
as
if
a
toronto
boy
like
ken
ford
would
ever
really
think
of
a
country
girl
like
ethel
rilla
flushed
it
did
not
matter
to
her
if
kenneth
ford
walked
home
with
ethel
reese
a
dozen
times
it
did
not
nothing
that
he
did
mattered
to
her
he
was
ages
older
than
she
was
he
chummed
with
nan
and
di
and
faith
and
looked
upon
her
rilla
as
a
child
whom
he
never
noticed
except
to
tease
and
she
detested
ethel
reese
and
ethel
reese
hated
her
always
had
hated
her
since
walter
had
pummelled
dan
so
notoriously
in
rainbow
valley
days
but
why
need
she
be
thought
beneath
kenneth
ford
notice
because
she
was
a
country
girl
pray
as
for
mary
vance
she
was
getting
to
be
an
gossip
and
thought
of
nothing
but
who
walked
home
with
people
there
was
a
little
pier
on
the
harbour
shore
below
the
house
of
dreams
and
two
boats
were
moored
there
one
boat
was
skippered
by
jem
blythe
the
other
by
joe
milgrave
who
knew
all
about
boats
and
was
nothing
loth
to
let
miranda
pryor
see
it
they
raced
down
the
harbour
and
boat
won
more
boats
were
coming
down
from
the
harbour
head
and
across
the
harbour
from
the
western
side
everywhere
there
was
laughter
the
big
white
tower
on
four
winds
point
was
overflowing
with
light
while
its
revolving
beacon
flashed
overhead
a
family
from
charlottetown
relatives
of
the
light
keeper
were
summering
at
the
light
and
they
were
giving
the
party
to
which
all
the
young
people
of
four
winds
and
glen
mary
and
had
been
invited
as
jem
boat
swung
in
below
the
lighthouse
rilla
desperately
snatched
off
her
shoes
and
donned
her
silver
slippers
behind
miss
oliver
screening
back
a
glance
had
told
her
that
the
steps
climbing
up
to
the
light
were
lined
with
boys
and
lighted
by
chinese
lanterns
and
she
was
determined
she
would
not
walk
up
those
steps
in
the
heavy
shoes
her
mother
had
insisted
on
her
wearing
for
the
road
the
slippers
pinched
abominably
but
nobody
would
have
suspected
it
as
rilla
tripped
smilingly
up
the
steps
her
soft
dark
eyes
glowing
and
questioning
her
colour
deepening
richly
on
her
round
creamy
cheeks
the
very
minute
she
reached
the
top
of
the
steps
an
boy
asked
her
to
dance
and
the
next
moment
they
were
in
the
pavilion
that
had
been
built
seaward
of
the
lighthouse
for
dances
it
was
a
delightful
spot
roofed
over
with
and
hung
with
lanterns
beyond
was
the
sea
in
a
radiance
that
glowed
and
shimmered
to
the
left
the
moonlit
crests
and
hollows
of
the
to
the
right
the
rocky
shore
with
its
inky
shadows
and
its
crystalline
coves
rilla
and
her
partner
swung
in
among
the
dancers
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
delight
what
witching
music
ned
burr
of
the
upper
glen
was
coaxing
from
his
fiddle
it
was
really
like
the
magical
pipes
of
the
old
tale
which
compelled
all
who
heard
them
to
dance
how
cool
and
fresh
the
gulf
breeze
blew
how
white
and
wonderful
the
moonlight
was
over
everything
this
was
life
enchanting
life
rilla
felt
as
if
her
feet
and
her
soul
both
had
wings
chapter
iv
the
piper
pipes
rilla
first
party
was
a
triumph
or
so
it
seemed
at
first
she
had
so
many
partners
that
she
had
to
split
her
dances
her
silver
slippers
seemed
verily
to
dance
of
themselves
and
though
they
continued
to
pinch
her
toes
and
blister
her
heels
that
did
not
interfere
with
her
enjoyment
in
the
least
ethel
reese
gave
her
a
bad
ten
minutes
by
beckoning
her
mysteriously
out
of
the
pavilion
and
whispering
with
a
smirk
that
her
dress
gaped
behind
and
that
there
was
a
stain
on
the
flounce
rilla
rushed
miserably
to
the
room
in
the
lighthouse
which
was
fitted
up
for
a
temporary
ladies
and
discovered
that
the
stain
was
merely
a
tiny
grass
smear
and
that
the
gap
was
equally
tiny
where
a
hook
had
pulled
loose
irene
howard
fastened
it
up
for
her
and
gave
her
some
condescending
compliments
rilla
felt
flattered
by
irene
condescension
she
was
an
upper
glen
girl
of
nineteen
who
seemed
to
like
the
society
of
the
younger
girls
spiteful
friends
said
because
she
could
queen
it
over
them
without
rivalry
but
rilla
thought
irene
quite
wonderful
and
loved
her
for
her
patronage
irene
was
pretty
and
stylish
she
sang
divinely
and
spent
every
winter
in
charlottetown
taking
music
lessons
she
had
an
aunt
in
montreal
who
sent
her
wonderful
things
to
wear
she
was
reported
to
have
had
a
sad
love
affair
nobody
knew
just
what
but
its
very
mystery
allured
rilla
felt
that
irene
compliments
crowned
her
evening
she
ran
gaily
back
to
the
pavilion
and
lingered
for
a
moment
in
the
glow
of
the
lanterns
at
the
entrance
looking
at
the
dancers
a
momentary
break
in
the
whirling
throng
gave
her
a
glimpse
of
kenneth
ford
standing
at
the
other
side
rilla
heart
skipped
a
beat
or
if
that
be
a
physiological
impossibility
she
thought
it
did
so
he
was
here
after
all
she
had
concluded
he
was
not
coming
not
that
it
mattered
in
the
least
would
he
see
her
would
he
take
any
notice
of
her
of
course
he
would
ask
her
to
dance
that
could
be
hoped
for
he
thought
her
just
a
mere
child
he
had
called
her
spider
not
three
weeks
ago
when
he
had
been
at
ingleside
one
evening
she
had
cried
about
it
upstairs
afterwards
and
hated
him
but
her
heart
skipped
a
beat
when
she
saw
that
he
was
edging
his
way
round
the
side
of
the
pavilion
towards
her
was
he
coming
to
her
was
he
was
he
yes
he
was
he
was
looking
for
her
he
was
here
beside
her
he
was
gazing
down
at
her
with
something
in
his
dark
grey
eyes
that
rilla
had
never
seen
in
them
oh
it
was
almost
too
much
to
bear
and
everything
was
going
on
as
before
the
dancers
were
spinning
round
the
boys
who
could
get
partners
were
hanging
about
the
pavilion
canoodling
couples
were
sitting
out
on
the
rocks
nobody
seemed
to
realize
what
a
stupendous
thing
had
happened
kenneth
was
a
tall
lad
very
good
looking
with
a
certain
careless
grace
of
bearing
that
somehow
made
all
the
other
boys
seem
stiff
and
awkward
by
contrast
he
was
reported
to
be
awesomely
clever
with
the
glamour
of
a
city
and
a
big
university
hanging
around
him
he
had
also
the
reputation
of
being
a
bit
of
a
but
that
probably
accrued
to
him
from
his
possession
of
a
laughing
velvety
voice
which
no
girl
could
hear
without
a
heartbeat
and
a
dangerous
way
of
listening
as
if
she
were
saying
something
that
he
had
longed
all
his
life
to
hear
is
this
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
yeth
said
rilla
and
immediately
wished
she
could
throw
herself
headlong
down
the
lighthouse
rock
or
otherwise
vanish
from
a
jeering
world
rilla
had
lisped
in
early
childhood
but
she
had
grown
out
of
it
only
on
occasions
of
stress
and
strain
did
the
tendency
itself
she
had
lisped
for
a
year
and
now
at
this
very
moment
when
she
was
so
especially
desirous
of
appearing
grown
up
and
sophisticated
she
must
go
and
lisp
like
a
baby
it
was
too
mortifying
she
felt
as
if
tears
were
going
to
come
into
her
eyes
the
next
minute
she
would
be
blubbering
yes
just
blubbering
she
wished
kenneth
would
go
away
she
wished
he
had
never
come
the
party
was
spoiled
everything
had
turned
to
dust
and
ashes
and
he
had
called
her
not
spider
or
kid
or
puss
as
he
had
been
used
to
call
her
when
he
took
any
notice
whatever
of
her
she
did
not
at
all
resent
his
using
walter
pet
name
for
her
it
sounded
beautifully
in
his
low
caressing
tones
with
just
the
faintest
suggestion
of
emphasis
on
the
my
it
would
have
been
so
nice
if
she
had
not
made
a
fool
of
herself
she
dared
not
look
up
lest
she
should
see
laughter
in
his
eyes
so
she
looked
down
and
as
her
lashes
were
very
long
and
dark
and
her
lids
very
thick
and
creamy
the
effect
was
quite
charming
and
provocative
and
kenneth
reflected
that
rilla
blythe
was
going
to
be
the
beauty
of
the
ingleside
girls
after
all
he
wanted
to
make
her
look
up
to
catch
again
that
little
demure
questioning
glance
she
was
the
prettiest
thing
at
the
party
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
what
was
he
saying
rilla
could
hardly
believe
her
ears
can
we
have
a
dance
yes
said
rilla
she
said
it
with
such
a
fierce
determination
not
to
lisp
that
she
fairly
blurted
the
word
out
then
she
writhed
in
spirit
again
it
sounded
so
bold
so
eager
as
if
she
were
fairly
jumping
at
him
what
would
he
think
of
her
oh
why
did
dreadful
things
like
this
happen
just
when
a
girl
wanted
to
appear
at
her
best
kenneth
drew
her
in
among
the
dancers
i
think
this
game
ankle
of
mine
is
good
for
one
hop
around
at
least
he
said
how
is
your
ankle
said
rilla
oh
why
could
she
think
of
something
else
to
say
she
knew
he
was
sick
of
inquiries
about
his
ankle
she
had
heard
him
say
so
at
ingleside
heard
him
tell
di
he
was
going
to
wear
a
placard
on
his
breast
announcing
to
all
and
sundry
that
the
ankle
was
improving
etc
and
now
she
must
go
and
ask
this
stale
question
again
kenneth
was
tired
of
inquiries
about
his
ankle
but
then
he
had
not
often
been
asked
about
it
by
lips
with
such
an
adorable
kissable
dent
just
above
them
perhaps
that
was
why
he
answered
very
patiently
that
it
was
getting
on
well
and
did
trouble
him
much
if
he
did
walk
or
stand
too
long
at
a
time
they
tell
me
it
will
be
as
strong
as
ever
in
time
but
i
have
to
cut
football
out
this
fall
they
danced
together
and
rilla
knew
every
girl
in
sight
envied
her
after
the
dance
they
went
down
the
rock
steps
and
kenneth
found
a
little
flat
and
they
rowed
across
the
moonlit
channel
to
the
they
walked
on
the
sand
till
kenneth
ankle
made
protest
and
then
they
sat
down
among
the
dunes
kenneth
talked
to
her
as
he
had
talked
to
nan
and
di
rilla
overcome
with
a
shyness
she
did
not
understand
could
not
talk
much
and
thought
he
would
think
her
frightfully
stupid
but
in
spite
of
this
it
was
all
very
wonderful
the
exquisite
moonlit
night
the
shining
sea
the
tiny
little
wavelets
swishing
on
the
sand
the
cool
and
freakish
wind
of
night
crooning
in
the
stiff
grasses
on
the
crest
of
the
dunes
the
music
sounding
faintly
and
sweetly
over
the
channel
merry
lilt
o
moonlight
for
mermaiden
revelry
quoted
kenneth
softly
from
one
of
walter
poems
and
just
he
and
she
alone
together
in
the
glamour
of
sound
and
sight
if
only
her
slippers
did
bite
so
and
if
only
she
could
talk
cleverly
like
miss
oliver
nay
if
she
could
only
talk
as
she
did
herself
to
other
boys
but
words
would
not
come
she
could
only
listen
and
murmur
little
commonplace
sentences
now
and
again
but
perhaps
her
dreamy
eyes
and
her
dented
lip
and
her
slender
throat
talked
eloquently
for
her
at
any
rate
kenneth
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
suggest
going
back
and
when
they
did
go
back
supper
was
in
progress
he
found
a
seat
for
her
near
the
window
of
the
lighthouse
kitchen
and
sat
on
the
sill
beside
her
while
she
ate
her
ices
and
cake
rilla
looked
about
her
and
thought
how
lovely
her
first
party
had
been
she
would
never
forget
it
the
room
to
laughter
and
jest
beautiful
young
eyes
sparkled
and
shone
from
the
pavilion
outside
came
the
lilt
of
the
fiddle
and
the
rhythmic
steps
of
the
dancers
there
was
a
little
disturbance
among
a
group
of
boys
crowded
about
the
door
a
young
fellow
pushed
through
and
halted
on
the
threshold
looking
about
him
rather
sombrely
it
was
jack
elliott
from
a
mcgill
medical
student
a
quiet
chap
not
much
addicted
to
social
doings
he
had
been
invited
to
the
party
but
had
not
been
expected
to
come
since
he
had
to
go
to
charlottetown
that
day
and
could
not
be
back
until
late
yet
here
he
was
and
he
carried
a
folded
paper
in
his
hand
gertrude
oliver
looked
at
him
from
her
corner
and
shivered
again
she
had
enjoyed
the
party
herself
after
all
for
she
had
foregathered
with
a
charlottetown
acquaintance
who
being
a
stranger
and
much
older
than
most
of
the
guests
felt
himself
rather
out
of
it
and
had
been
glad
to
fall
in
with
this
clever
girl
who
could
talk
of
world
doings
and
outside
events
with
the
zest
and
vigour
of
a
man
in
the
pleasure
of
his
society
she
had
forgotten
some
of
her
misgivings
of
the
day
now
they
suddenly
returned
to
her
what
news
did
jack
elliott
bring
lines
from
an
old
poem
flashed
unbidden
into
her
mind
there
was
a
sound
of
revelry
by
night
hush
hark
a
deep
sound
strikes
like
a
rising
knell
why
should
she
think
of
that
now
why
did
jack
elliott
speak
if
he
had
anything
to
tell
why
did
he
just
stand
there
glowering
importantly
ask
him
ask
him
she
said
feverishly
to
allan
daly
but
somebody
else
had
already
asked
him
the
room
grew
very
silent
all
at
once
outside
the
fiddler
had
stopped
for
a
rest
and
there
was
silence
there
too
afar
off
they
heard
the
low
moan
of
the
gulf
the
presage
of
a
storm
already
on
its
way
up
the
atlantic
a
girl
laugh
drifted
up
from
the
rocks
and
died
away
as
if
frightened
out
of
existence
by
the
sudden
stillness
england
declared
war
on
germany
today
said
jack
elliott
slowly
the
news
came
by
wire
just
as
i
left
town
god
help
us
whispered
gertrude
oliver
under
her
breath
my
dream
my
dream
the
first
wave
has
broken
she
looked
at
allan
daly
and
tried
to
smile
is
this
armageddon
she
asked
i
am
afraid
so
he
said
gravely
a
chorus
of
exclamations
had
arisen
round
them
light
surprise
and
idle
interest
for
the
most
part
few
there
realized
the
import
of
the
message
fewer
still
realized
that
it
meant
anything
to
them
before
long
the
dancing
was
on
again
and
the
hum
of
pleasure
was
as
loud
as
ever
gertrude
and
allan
daly
talked
the
news
over
in
low
troubled
tones
walter
blythe
had
turned
pale
and
left
the
room
outside
he
met
jem
hurrying
up
the
rock
steps
have
you
heard
the
news
jem
yes
the
piper
has
come
hurrah
i
knew
england
would
leave
france
in
the
lurch
i
been
trying
to
get
captain
josiah
to
hoist
the
flag
but
he
says
it
is
the
proper
caper
till
sunrise
jack
says
be
calling
for
volunteers
tomorrow
what
a
fuss
to
make
over
nothing
said
mary
vance
disdainfully
as
jem
dashed
off
she
was
sitting
out
with
miller
douglas
on
a
lobster
trap
which
was
not
only
an
unromantic
but
an
uncomfortable
seat
but
mary
and
miller
were
both
supremely
happy
on
it
miller
douglas
was
a
big
strapping
uncouth
lad
who
thought
mary
vance
tongue
uncommonly
gifted
and
mary
vance
white
eyes
stars
of
the
first
magnitude
and
neither
of
them
had
the
least
inkling
why
jem
blythe
wanted
to
hoist
the
lighthouse
flag
what
does
it
matter
if
there
going
to
be
a
war
over
there
in
europe
i
sure
it
does
concern
us
walter
looked
at
her
and
had
one
of
his
odd
visitations
of
prophecy
before
this
war
is
over
he
said
or
something
said
through
his
lips
every
man
and
woman
and
child
in
canada
will
feel
it
you
mary
will
feel
it
feel
it
to
your
heart
core
you
will
weep
tears
of
blood
over
it
the
piper
has
come
and
he
will
pipe
until
every
corner
of
the
world
has
heard
his
awful
and
irresistible
music
it
will
be
years
before
the
dance
of
death
is
over
years
mary
and
in
those
years
millions
of
hearts
will
break
fancy
now
said
mary
who
always
said
that
when
she
could
think
of
anything
else
to
say
she
did
know
what
walter
meant
but
she
felt
uncomfortable
walter
blythe
was
always
saying
odd
things
that
old
piper
of
his
she
had
heard
anything
about
him
since
their
playdays
in
rainbow
valley
and
now
here
he
was
bobbing
up
again
she
like
it
and
that
was
the
long
and
short
of
it
are
you
painting
it
rather
strong
walter
asked
harvey
crawford
coming
up
just
then
this
war
wo
last
for
years
it
be
over
in
a
month
or
two
england
will
just
wipe
germany
off
the
map
in
no
time
do
you
think
a
war
for
which
germany
has
been
preparing
for
twenty
years
will
be
over
in
a
few
weeks
said
walter
passionately
this
is
a
paltry
struggle
in
a
balkan
corner
harvey
it
is
a
death
grapple
germany
comes
to
conquer
or
to
die
and
do
you
know
what
will
happen
if
she
conquers
canada
will
be
a
german
colony
well
i
guess
a
few
things
will
happen
before
that
said
harvey
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
british
navy
would
have
to
be
licked
for
one
and
for
another
miller
here
now
and
i
we
raise
a
dust
would
we
miller
no
germans
need
apply
for
this
old
country
eh
harvey
ran
down
the
steps
laughing
i
declare
i
think
all
you
boys
talk
the
craziest
stuff
said
mary
vance
in
disgust
she
got
up
and
dragged
miller
off
to
the
it
did
happen
often
that
they
had
a
chance
for
a
talk
together
mary
was
determined
that
this
one
should
be
spoiled
by
walter
silly
blather
about
pipers
and
germans
and
such
like
absurd
things
they
left
walter
standing
alone
on
the
rock
steps
looking
out
over
the
beauty
of
four
winds
with
brooding
eyes
that
saw
it
not
the
best
of
the
evening
was
over
for
rilla
too
ever
since
jack
elliott
announcement
she
had
sensed
that
kenneth
was
no
longer
thinking
about
her
she
felt
suddenly
lonely
and
unhappy
it
was
worse
than
if
he
had
never
noticed
her
at
all
was
life
like
this
something
delightful
happening
and
then
just
as
you
were
revelling
in
it
slipping
away
from
you
rilla
told
herself
pathetically
that
she
felt
years
older
than
when
she
had
left
home
that
evening
perhaps
she
did
perhaps
she
was
who
knows
it
does
not
do
to
laugh
at
the
pangs
of
youth
they
are
very
terrible
because
youth
has
not
yet
learned
that
this
too
will
pass
away
rilla
sighed
and
wished
she
were
home
in
bed
crying
into
her
pillow
tired
said
kenneth
gently
but
absently
oh
so
absently
he
really
did
care
a
bit
whether
she
were
tired
or
not
she
thought
kenneth
she
ventured
timidly
you
do
think
this
war
will
matter
much
to
us
in
canada
do
you
matter
of
course
it
will
matter
to
the
lucky
fellows
who
will
be
able
to
take
a
hand
i
wo
thanks
to
this
confounded
ankle
rotten
luck
i
call
it
i
do
see
why
we
should
fight
england
battles
cried
rilla
she
quite
able
to
fight
them
herself
that
is
the
point
we
are
part
of
the
british
empire
it
a
family
affair
we
got
to
stand
by
each
other
the
worst
of
it
is
it
will
be
over
before
i
can
be
of
any
use
do
you
mean
that
you
would
really
volunteer
to
go
if
it
was
for
your
ankle
asked
rilla
incredulously
sure
i
would
you
see
they
go
by
thousands
jem
be
off
i
bet
a
cent
walter
wo
be
strong
enough
yet
i
suppose
and
jerry
meredith
he
go
and
i
was
worrying
about
being
out
of
football
this
year
rilla
was
too
startled
to
say
anything
jem
and
jerry
nonsense
why
father
and
meredith
would
allow
it
they
were
through
college
oh
why
had
jack
elliott
kept
his
horrid
news
to
himself
mark
warren
came
up
and
asked
her
to
dance
rilla
went
knowing
kenneth
did
care
whether
she
went
or
stayed
an
hour
ago
on
the
he
had
been
looking
at
her
as
if
she
were
the
only
being
of
any
importance
in
the
world
and
now
she
was
nobody
his
thoughts
were
full
of
this
great
game
which
was
to
be
played
out
on
bloodstained
fields
with
empires
for
stakes
a
game
in
which
womenkind
could
have
no
part
women
thought
rilla
miserably
just
had
to
sit
and
cry
at
home
but
all
this
was
foolishness
kenneth
could
go
he
admitted
that
himself
and
walter
could
thank
goodness
for
that
and
jem
and
jerry
would
have
more
sense
she
would
worry
she
would
enjoy
herself
but
how
awkward
mark
warren
was
how
he
bungled
his
steps
why
for
mercy
sake
did
boys
try
to
dance
who
did
know
the
first
thing
about
dancing
and
who
had
feet
as
big
as
boats
there
he
had
bumped
her
into
somebody
she
would
never
dance
with
him
again
she
danced
with
others
though
the
zest
was
gone
out
of
the
performance
and
she
had
begun
to
realize
that
her
slippers
hurt
her
badly
kenneth
seemed
to
have
gone
at
least
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
him
her
first
party
was
spoiled
though
it
had
seemed
so
beautiful
at
one
time
her
head
ached
her
toes
burned
and
worse
was
yet
to
come
she
had
gone
down
with
some
friends
to
the
where
they
all
lingered
as
dance
after
dance
went
on
above
them
it
was
cool
and
pleasant
and
they
were
tired
rilla
sat
silent
taking
no
part
in
the
gay
conversation
she
was
glad
when
someone
called
down
that
the
boats
were
leaving
a
laughing
scramble
up
the
lighthouse
rock
followed
a
few
couples
still
whirled
about
in
the
pavilion
but
the
crowd
had
thinned
out
rilla
looked
about
her
for
the
glen
group
she
could
not
see
one
of
them
she
ran
into
the
lighthouse
still
no
sign
of
anybody
in
dismay
she
ran
to
the
rock
steps
down
which
the
guests
were
hurrying
she
could
see
the
boats
below
where
was
jem
where
was
joe
why
rilla
blythe
i
thought
you
be
gone
home
long
ago
said
mary
vance
who
was
waving
her
scarf
at
a
boat
skimming
up
the
channel
skippered
by
miller
douglas
where
are
the
rest
gasped
rilla
why
they
gone
jem
went
an
hour
ago
una
had
a
headache
and
the
rest
went
with
joe
about
fifteen
minutes
ago
see
they
just
going
around
birch
point
i
did
go
because
it
getting
rough
and
i
knew
i
be
seasick
i
do
mind
walking
home
from
here
it
only
a
mile
and
a
half
i
you
gone
where
were
you
down
on
the
rocks
with
jem
and
mollie
crawford
oh
why
did
they
look
for
me
they
did
but
you
could
be
found
then
they
concluded
you
must
have
gone
in
the
other
boat
do
worry
you
can
stay
all
night
with
me
and
we
up
to
ingleside
where
you
are
rilla
realized
that
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
her
lips
trembled
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
blinked
savagely
she
would
not
let
mary
vance
see
her
crying
but
to
be
forgotten
like
this
to
think
nobody
had
thought
it
worth
while
to
make
sure
where
she
was
not
even
walter
then
she
had
a
sudden
dismayed
recollection
my
shoes
she
exclaimed
i
left
them
in
the
boat
well
i
never
said
mary
you
the
most
thoughtless
kid
i
ever
saw
you
have
to
ask
hazel
lewison
to
lend
you
a
pair
of
shoes
i
wo
cried
rilla
who
did
like
the
said
hazel
i
go
barefoot
first
mary
shrugged
her
shoulders
just
as
you
like
pride
must
suffer
pain
it
teach
you
to
be
more
careful
well
let
hike
accordingly
they
hiked
but
to
hike
along
a
pebbly
lane
in
frail
slippers
with
high
french
heels
is
not
an
exhilarating
performance
rilla
managed
to
limp
and
totter
along
until
they
reached
the
harbour
road
but
she
could
go
no
farther
in
those
detestable
slippers
she
took
them
and
her
dear
silk
stockings
off
and
started
barefoot
that
was
not
pleasant
either
her
feet
were
very
tender
and
the
pebbles
and
ruts
of
the
road
hurt
them
her
blistered
heels
smarted
but
physical
pain
was
almost
forgotten
in
the
sting
of
humiliation
this
was
a
nice
predicament
if
kenneth
ford
could
see
her
now
limping
along
like
a
little
girl
with
a
stone
bruise
oh
what
a
horrid
way
for
her
lovely
party
to
end
she
just
had
to
cry
it
was
too
terrible
nobody
cared
for
her
nobody
bothered
about
her
at
all
well
if
she
caught
cold
from
walking
home
barefoot
on
a
road
and
went
into
a
decline
perhaps
they
would
be
sorry
she
furtively
wiped
her
tears
away
with
her
scarf
handkerchiefs
seemed
to
have
vanished
like
shoes
but
she
could
not
help
sniffling
worse
and
worse
you
got
a
cold
i
see
said
mary
you
ought
to
have
known
you
would
sitting
down
in
the
wind
on
those
rocks
your
mother
wo
let
you
go
out
again
in
a
hurry
i
can
tell
you
it
certainly
been
something
of
a
party
the
lewisons
know
how
to
do
things
i
say
that
for
them
though
hazel
lewison
is
no
choice
of
mine
my
how
black
she
looked
when
she
saw
you
dancing
with
ken
ford
and
so
did
that
little
hussy
of
an
ethel
reese
what
a
flirt
he
is
i
do
think
he
a
flirt
said
rilla
as
defiantly
as
two
desperate
sniffs
would
let
her
you
know
more
about
men
when
you
as
old
as
i
am
said
mary
patronizingly
mind
you
it
does
do
to
believe
all
they
tell
you
do
let
ken
ford
think
that
all
he
has
to
do
to
get
you
on
a
string
is
to
drop
his
handkerchief
have
more
spirit
than
that
child
to
be
thus
hectored
and
patronized
by
mary
vance
was
unendurable
and
it
was
unendurable
to
walk
on
stony
roads
with
blistered
heels
and
bare
feet
and
it
was
unendurable
to
be
crying
and
have
no
handkerchief
and
not
to
be
able
to
stop
crying
i
not
thinking
sniff
about
kenneth
sniff
ford
two
sniffs
at
all
cried
tortured
rilla
there
no
need
to
fly
off
the
handle
child
you
ought
to
be
willing
to
take
advice
from
older
people
i
saw
how
you
slipped
over
to
the
sands
with
ken
and
stayed
there
ever
so
long
with
him
your
mother
would
like
it
if
she
knew
i
tell
my
mother
all
about
it
and
miss
oliver
and
walter
rilla
gasped
between
sniffs
you
sat
for
hours
with
miller
douglas
on
that
lobster
trap
mary
vance
what
would
elliott
say
to
that
if
she
knew
oh
i
not
going
to
quarrel
with
you
said
mary
suddenly
retreating
to
high
and
lofty
ground
all
i
say
is
you
should
wait
until
before
you
do
things
like
that
rilla
gave
up
trying
to
hide
the
fact
that
she
was
crying
everything
was
spoiled
even
that
beautiful
dreamy
romantic
moonlit
hour
with
kenneth
on
the
sands
was
vulgarized
and
cheapened
she
loathed
mary
vance
why
whatever
wrong
cried
mystified
mary
what
are
you
crying
for
my
feet
hurt
so
sobbed
rilla
clinging
to
the
last
shred
of
her
pride
it
was
less
humiliating
to
admit
crying
because
of
your
feet
than
because
because
somebody
had
been
amusing
himself
with
you
and
your
friends
had
forgotten
you
and
other
people
patronized
you
i
daresay
they
do
said
mary
not
unkindly
never
mind
i
know
where
there
a
pot
of
in
cornelia
tidy
pantry
and
it
beats
all
the
fancy
cold
creams
in
the
world
i
put
some
on
your
heels
before
you
go
to
bed
on
your
heels
so
this
was
what
your
first
party
and
your
first
beau
and
your
first
moonlit
romance
ended
in
rilla
gave
over
crying
in
sheer
disgust
at
the
futility
of
tears
and
went
to
sleep
in
mary
vance
bed
in
the
calm
of
despair
outside
the
dawn
came
greyly
in
on
wings
of
storm
captain
josiah
true
to
his
word
ran
up
the
union
jack
at
the
four
winds
light
and
it
streamed
on
the
fierce
wind
against
the
clouded
sky
like
a
gallant
unquenchable
beacon
chapter
v
the
sound
of
a
going
rilla
ran
down
through
the
sunlit
glory
of
the
maple
grove
behind
ingleside
to
her
favourite
nook
in
rainbow
valley
she
sat
down
on
a
stone
among
the
fern
propped
her
chin
on
her
hands
and
stared
unseeingly
at
the
dazzling
blue
sky
of
the
august
afternoon
so
blue
so
peaceful
so
unchanged
just
as
it
had
arched
over
the
valley
in
the
mellow
days
of
late
summer
ever
since
she
could
remember
she
wanted
to
be
alone
to
think
things
out
to
adjust
herself
if
it
were
possible
to
the
new
world
into
which
she
seemed
to
have
been
transplanted
with
a
suddenness
and
completeness
that
left
her
half
bewildered
as
to
her
own
identity
was
she
could
she
be
the
same
rilla
blythe
who
had
danced
at
four
winds
light
six
days
ago
only
six
days
ago
it
seemed
to
rilla
that
she
had
lived
as
much
in
those
six
days
as
in
all
her
previous
life
and
if
it
be
true
that
we
should
count
time
by
she
had
that
evening
with
its
hopes
and
fears
and
triumphs
and
humiliations
seemed
like
ancient
history
now
could
she
really
ever
have
cried
just
because
she
had
been
forgotten
and
had
to
walk
home
with
mary
vance
ah
thought
rilla
sadly
how
trivial
and
absurd
such
a
cause
of
tears
now
appeared
to
her
she
could
cry
now
with
a
right
good
will
but
she
would
not
she
must
not
what
was
it
mother
had
said
looking
with
her
white
lips
and
stricken
eyes
as
rilla
had
never
seen
her
mother
look
before
when
our
women
fail
in
courage
shall
our
men
be
fearless
still
yes
that
was
it
she
must
be
brave
like
mother
and
nan
and
faith
faith
who
had
cried
with
flashing
eyes
oh
if
i
were
only
a
man
to
go
too
only
when
her
eyes
ached
and
her
throat
burned
like
this
she
had
to
hide
herself
in
rainbow
valley
for
a
little
just
to
think
things
out
and
remember
that
she
was
a
child
any
longer
she
was
and
women
had
to
face
things
like
this
but
it
was
nice
to
get
away
alone
now
and
then
where
nobody
could
see
her
and
where
she
need
feel
that
people
thought
her
a
little
coward
if
some
tears
came
in
spite
of
her
how
sweet
and
woodsey
the
ferns
smelled
how
softly
the
great
feathery
boughs
of
the
firs
waved
and
murmured
over
her
how
elfinly
rang
the
bells
of
the
tree
lovers
just
a
tinkle
now
and
then
as
the
breeze
swept
by
how
purple
and
elusive
the
haze
where
incense
was
being
offered
on
many
an
altar
of
the
hills
how
the
maple
leaves
whitened
in
the
wind
until
the
grove
seemed
covered
with
pale
silvery
blossoms
everything
was
just
the
same
as
she
had
seen
it
hundreds
of
times
and
yet
the
whole
face
of
the
world
seemed
changed
how
wicked
i
was
to
wish
that
something
dramatic
would
happen
she
thought
oh
if
we
could
only
have
those
dear
monotonous
pleasant
days
back
again
i
would
never
never
grumble
about
them
again
rilla
world
had
tumbled
to
pieces
the
very
day
after
the
party
as
they
lingered
around
the
dinner
table
at
ingleside
talking
of
the
war
the
telephone
had
rung
it
was
a
call
from
charlottetown
for
jem
when
he
had
finished
talking
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turned
around
with
a
flushed
face
and
glowing
eyes
before
he
had
said
a
word
his
mother
and
nan
and
di
had
turned
pale
as
for
rilla
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
that
every
one
must
hear
her
heart
beating
and
that
something
had
clutched
at
her
throat
they
are
calling
for
volunteers
in
town
father
said
jem
scores
have
joined
up
already
i
going
in
tonight
to
enlist
oh
little
jem
cried
blythe
brokenly
she
had
not
called
him
that
for
many
years
not
since
the
day
he
had
rebelled
against
it
oh
no
no
little
jem
i
must
mother
i
right
am
i
not
father
said
jem
blythe
had
risen
he
was
very
pale
too
and
his
voice
was
husky
but
he
did
not
hesitate
yes
jem
yes
if
you
feel
that
way
yes
blythe
covered
her
face
walter
stared
moodily
at
his
plate
nan
and
di
clasped
each
others
hands
shirley
tried
to
look
unconcerned
susan
sat
as
if
paralysed
her
piece
of
pie
on
her
plate
susan
never
did
finish
that
piece
of
pie
a
fact
which
bore
eloquent
testimony
to
the
upheaval
in
her
inner
woman
for
susan
considered
it
a
cardinal
offence
against
civilized
society
to
begin
to
eat
anything
and
not
finish
it
that
was
wilful
waste
hens
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
jem
turned
to
the
phone
again
i
must
ring
the
manse
jerry
will
want
to
go
too
at
this
nan
had
cried
out
oh
as
if
a
knife
had
been
thrust
into
her
and
rushed
from
the
room
di
followed
her
rilla
turned
to
walter
for
comfort
but
walter
was
lost
to
her
in
some
reverie
she
could
not
share
all
right
jem
was
saying
as
coolly
as
if
he
were
arranging
the
details
of
a
picnic
i
thought
you
would
yes
tonight
the
seven
meet
me
at
the
station
so
long
dear
said
susan
i
wish
you
would
wake
me
up
am
i
dreaming
or
am
i
awake
does
that
blessed
boy
realize
what
he
is
saying
does
he
mean
that
he
is
going
to
enlist
as
a
soldier
you
do
not
mean
to
tell
me
that
they
want
children
like
him
it
is
an
outrage
surely
you
and
the
doctor
will
not
permit
it
we
ca
stop
him
said
blythe
chokingly
oh
gilbert
blythe
came
up
behind
his
wife
and
took
her
hand
gently
looking
down
into
the
sweet
grey
eyes
that
he
had
only
once
before
seen
filled
with
such
imploring
anguish
as
now
they
both
thought
of
that
other
time
the
day
years
ago
in
the
house
of
dreams
when
little
joyce
had
died
would
you
have
him
stay
anne
when
the
others
are
going
when
he
thinks
it
his
duty
would
you
have
him
so
selfish
and
no
no
but
oh
our
son
he
only
a
lad
gilbert
try
to
be
brave
after
a
while
just
now
i
ca
it
all
come
so
suddenly
give
me
time
the
doctor
and
his
wife
went
out
of
the
room
jem
had
gone
walter
had
gone
shirley
got
up
to
go
rilla
and
susan
remained
staring
at
each
other
across
the
deserted
table
rilla
had
not
yet
cried
she
was
too
stunned
for
tears
then
she
saw
that
susan
was
crying
susan
whom
she
had
never
seen
shed
a
tear
before
oh
susan
will
he
really
go
she
asked
it
it
it
is
just
ridiculous
that
is
what
it
is
said
susan
she
wiped
away
her
tears
gulped
resolutely
and
got
up
i
am
going
to
wash
the
dishes
that
has
to
be
done
even
if
everybody
has
gone
crazy
there
now
dearie
do
not
you
cry
jem
will
go
most
likely
but
the
war
will
be
over
long
before
he
gets
anywhere
near
it
let
us
take
a
brace
and
not
worry
your
poor
mother
in
the
enterprise
today
it
was
reported
that
lord
kitchener
says
the
war
will
last
three
years
said
rilla
dubiously
i
am
not
acquainted
with
lord
kitchener
said
susan
composedly
but
i
dare
say
he
makes
mistakes
as
often
as
other
people
your
father
says
it
will
be
over
in
a
few
months
and
i
have
as
much
faith
in
his
opinion
as
i
have
in
lord
anybody
so
just
let
us
be
calm
and
trust
in
the
almighty
and
get
this
place
tidied
up
i
am
done
with
crying
which
is
a
waste
of
time
and
discourages
everybody
jem
and
jerry
went
to
charlottetown
that
night
and
two
days
later
they
came
back
in
khaki
the
glen
hummed
with
excitement
over
it
life
at
ingleside
had
suddenly
become
a
tense
strained
thrilling
thing
blythe
and
nan
were
brave
and
smiling
and
wonderful
already
blythe
and
miss
cornelia
were
organizing
a
red
cross
the
doctor
and
meredith
were
rounding
up
the
men
for
a
patriotic
society
rilla
after
the
first
shock
reacted
to
the
romance
of
it
all
in
spite
of
her
heartache
jem
certainly
looked
magnificent
in
his
uniform
it
was
splendid
to
think
of
the
lads
of
canada
answering
so
speedily
and
fearlessly
and
uncalculatingly
to
the
call
of
their
country
rilla
carried
her
head
high
among
the
girls
whose
brothers
had
not
so
responded
in
her
diary
she
wrote
he
goes
to
do
what
i
had
done
had
douglas
daughter
been
his
son
and
was
sure
she
meant
it
if
she
were
a
boy
of
course
she
would
go
too
she
had
the
least
doubt
of
that
she
wondered
if
it
was
very
dreadful
of
her
to
feel
glad
that
walter
had
got
strong
as
soon
as
they
had
wished
after
the
fever
i
could
bear
to
have
walter
go
she
wrote
i
love
jem
ever
so
much
but
walter
means
more
to
me
than
anyone
in
the
world
and
i
would
die
if
he
had
to
go
he
seems
so
changed
these
days
he
hardly
ever
talks
to
me
i
suppose
he
wants
to
go
too
and
feels
badly
because
he
ca
he
does
go
about
with
jem
and
jerry
at
all
i
shall
never
forget
susan
face
when
jem
came
home
in
his
khaki
it
worked
and
twisted
as
if
she
were
going
to
cry
but
all
she
said
was
look
almost
like
a
man
in
that
jem
jem
laughed
he
never
minds
because
susan
thinks
him
just
a
child
still
everybody
seems
busy
but
me
i
wish
there
was
something
i
could
do
but
there
does
seem
to
be
anything
mother
and
nan
and
di
are
busy
all
the
time
and
i
just
wander
about
like
a
lonely
ghost
what
hurts
me
terribly
though
is
that
mother
smiles
and
nan
just
seem
put
on
from
the
outside
eyes
never
laugh
now
it
makes
me
feel
that
i
should
laugh
either
that
it
wicked
to
feel
laughy
and
it
so
hard
for
me
to
keep
from
laughing
even
if
jem
is
going
to
be
a
soldier
but
when
i
laugh
i
do
enjoy
it
either
as
i
used
to
do
there
something
behind
it
all
that
keeps
hurting
me
especially
when
i
wake
up
in
the
night
then
i
cry
because
i
am
afraid
that
kitchener
of
khartoum
is
right
and
the
war
will
last
for
years
and
jem
may
be
but
no
i
write
it
it
would
make
me
feel
as
if
it
were
really
going
to
happen
the
other
day
nan
said
can
ever
be
quite
the
same
for
any
of
us
again
it
made
me
feel
rebellious
why
should
things
be
the
same
again
when
everything
is
over
and
jem
and
jerry
are
back
we
all
be
happy
and
jolly
again
and
these
days
will
seem
just
like
a
bad
dream
the
coming
of
the
mail
is
the
most
exciting
event
of
every
day
now
father
just
snatches
the
paper
i
never
saw
father
snatch
before
and
the
rest
of
us
crowd
round
and
look
at
the
headlines
over
his
shoulder
susan
vows
she
does
not
and
will
not
believe
a
word
the
papers
say
but
she
always
comes
to
the
kitchen
door
and
listens
and
then
goes
back
shaking
her
head
she
is
terribly
indignant
all
the
time
but
she
cooks
up
all
the
things
jem
likes
especially
and
she
did
not
make
a
single
bit
of
fuss
when
she
found
monday
asleep
on
the
bed
yesterday
right
on
top
of
rachel
lynde
spread
almighty
only
knows
where
your
master
will
be
having
to
sleep
before
long
you
poor
dumb
beast
she
said
as
she
put
him
quite
gently
out
but
she
never
relents
towards
doc
she
says
the
minute
he
saw
jem
in
khaki
he
turned
into
hyde
then
and
there
and
she
thinks
that
ought
to
be
proof
enough
of
what
he
really
is
susan
is
funny
but
she
is
an
old
dear
shirley
says
she
is
one
half
angel
and
the
other
half
good
cook
but
then
shirley
is
the
only
one
of
us
she
never
scolds
faith
meredith
is
wonderful
i
think
she
and
jem
are
really
engaged
now
she
goes
about
with
a
shining
light
in
her
eyes
but
her
smiles
are
a
little
stiff
and
starched
just
like
mother
i
wonder
if
i
could
be
as
brave
as
she
is
if
i
had
a
lover
and
he
was
going
to
the
war
it
is
bad
enough
when
it
is
your
brother
bruce
meredith
cried
all
night
meredith
says
when
he
heard
jem
and
jerry
were
going
and
he
wanted
to
know
if
the
of
his
father
talked
about
was
the
king
of
kings
he
is
the
dearest
kiddy
i
just
love
him
though
i
really
care
much
for
children
i
do
like
babies
one
bit
though
when
i
say
so
people
look
at
me
as
if
i
had
said
something
perfectly
shocking
well
i
do
and
i
got
to
be
honest
about
it
i
mind
looking
at
a
nice
clean
baby
if
somebody
else
holds
it
but
i
would
touch
it
for
anything
and
i
do
feel
a
single
real
spark
of
interest
in
it
gertrude
oliver
says
she
just
feels
the
same
she
is
the
most
honest
person
i
know
she
never
pretends
anything
she
says
babies
bore
her
until
they
are
old
enough
to
talk
and
then
she
likes
them
but
still
a
good
ways
off
mother
and
nan
and
di
all
adore
babies
and
seem
to
think
i
unnatural
because
i
do
i
have
seen
kenneth
since
the
night
of
the
party
he
was
here
one
evening
after
jem
came
back
but
i
happened
to
be
away
i
do
think
he
mentioned
me
at
all
at
least
nobody
told
me
he
did
and
i
was
determined
i
would
ask
but
i
do
care
in
the
least
all
that
matters
absolutely
nothing
to
me
now
the
only
thing
that
does
matter
is
that
jem
has
volunteered
for
active
service
and
will
be
going
to
valcartier
in
a
few
more
days
my
big
splendid
brother
jem
oh
i
so
proud
of
him
i
suppose
kenneth
would
enlist
too
if
it
were
for
his
ankle
i
think
that
is
quite
providential
he
is
his
mother
only
son
and
how
dreadful
she
would
feel
if
he
went
only
sons
should
never
think
of
going
walter
came
wandering
through
the
valley
as
rilla
sat
there
with
his
head
bent
and
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
when
he
saw
rilla
he
turned
abruptly
away
then
as
abruptly
he
turned
and
came
back
to
her
what
are
you
thinking
of
everything
is
so
changed
walter
said
rilla
wistfully
even
you
you
changed
a
week
ago
we
were
all
so
happy
and
and
now
i
just
ca
find
myself
at
all
i
lost
walter
sat
down
on
a
neighbouring
stone
and
took
rilla
little
appealing
hand
i
afraid
our
old
world
has
come
to
an
end
rilla
we
got
to
face
that
fact
it
so
terrible
to
think
of
jem
pleaded
rilla
sometimes
i
forget
for
a
little
while
what
it
really
means
and
feel
excited
and
proud
and
then
it
comes
over
me
again
like
a
cold
wind
i
envy
jem
said
walter
moodily
envy
jem
oh
walter
you
you
do
want
to
go
too
no
said
walter
gazing
straight
before
him
down
the
emerald
vistas
of
the
valley
no
i
do
want
to
go
that
just
the
trouble
rilla
i
afraid
to
go
i
a
coward
you
not
rilla
burst
out
angrily
why
anybody
would
be
afraid
to
go
you
might
be
why
you
might
be
killed
i
would
mind
that
if
it
did
hurt
muttered
walter
i
think
i
afraid
of
death
itself
it
of
the
pain
that
might
come
before
death
it
would
be
so
bad
to
die
and
have
it
over
but
to
keep
on
dying
rilla
i
always
been
afraid
of
pain
you
know
that
i
ca
help
it
i
shudder
when
i
think
of
the
possibility
of
being
mangled
or
or
blinded
rilla
i
can
not
face
that
thought
to
be
blind
never
to
see
the
beauty
of
the
world
again
moonlight
on
four
winds
the
stars
twinkling
through
the
mist
on
the
gulf
i
ought
to
go
i
ought
to
want
to
go
but
i
do
i
hate
the
thought
of
it
i
ashamed
ashamed
but
walter
you
could
go
anyhow
said
rilla
piteously
she
was
sick
with
a
new
terror
that
walter
would
go
after
all
you
not
strong
enough
i
am
i
felt
as
fit
as
ever
i
did
this
last
month
i
pass
any
examination
i
know
it
everybody
thinks
i
not
strong
yet
and
skulking
behind
that
belief
i
i
should
have
been
a
girl
walter
concluded
in
a
burst
of
passionate
bitterness
even
if
you
were
strong
enough
you
ought
to
go
sobbed
rilla
what
would
mother
do
she
breaking
her
heart
over
jem
it
would
kill
her
to
see
you
both
go
oh
i
not
going
do
worry
i
tell
you
i
afraid
to
go
afraid
i
do
mince
the
matter
to
myself
it
a
relief
to
own
up
even
to
you
rilla
i
would
confess
it
to
anybody
else
nan
and
di
would
despise
me
but
i
hate
the
whole
thing
the
horror
the
pain
the
ugliness
war
is
a
khaki
uniform
or
a
drill
parade
everything
i
read
in
old
histories
haunts
me
i
lie
awake
at
night
and
see
things
that
have
happened
see
the
blood
and
filth
and
misery
of
it
all
and
a
bayonet
charge
if
i
could
face
the
other
things
i
could
never
face
that
it
turns
me
sick
to
think
of
it
sicker
even
to
think
of
giving
it
than
receiving
it
to
think
of
thrusting
a
bayonet
through
another
man
walter
writhed
and
shuddered
i
think
of
these
things
all
the
time
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
jem
and
jerry
ever
think
of
them
they
laugh
and
talk
about
huns
but
it
maddens
me
to
see
them
in
the
khaki
and
they
think
i
grumpy
because
i
not
fit
to
go
walter
laughed
bitterly
it
is
not
a
nice
thing
to
feel
yourself
a
coward
but
rilla
got
her
arms
about
him
and
cuddled
her
head
on
his
shoulder
she
was
so
glad
he
did
want
to
go
for
just
one
minute
she
had
been
horribly
frightened
and
it
was
so
nice
to
have
walter
confiding
his
troubles
to
her
to
her
not
di
she
did
feel
so
lonely
and
superfluous
any
longer
do
you
despise
me
asked
walter
wistfully
somehow
it
hurt
him
to
think
rilla
might
despise
him
hurt
him
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
di
he
realized
suddenly
how
very
fond
he
was
of
this
adoring
kid
sister
with
her
appealing
eyes
and
troubled
girlish
face
no
i
do
why
walter
hundreds
of
people
feel
just
as
you
do
you
know
what
that
verse
of
shakespeare
in
the
old
fifth
reader
says
brave
man
is
not
he
who
feels
no
fear
no
but
it
is
whose
noble
soul
its
fear
subdues
i
do
do
that
we
ca
gloss
it
over
rilla
i
a
coward
you
not
think
of
how
you
fought
dan
reese
long
ago
one
spurt
of
courage
is
enough
for
a
lifetime
walter
one
time
i
heard
father
say
that
the
trouble
with
you
was
a
sensitive
nature
and
a
vivid
imagination
you
feel
things
before
they
really
come
feel
them
all
alone
when
there
is
anything
to
help
you
bear
them
to
take
away
from
them
it
is
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
when
you
and
jem
got
your
hands
burned
when
the
grass
was
fired
on
the
two
years
ago
jem
made
twice
the
fuss
over
the
pain
that
you
did
as
for
this
horrid
old
war
there
be
plenty
to
go
without
you
it
wo
last
long
i
wish
i
could
believe
it
well
it
rilla
you
better
run
i
do
want
anything
neither
do
i
could
eat
a
mouthful
let
me
stay
here
with
you
walter
it
such
a
comfort
to
talk
things
over
with
someone
the
rest
all
think
that
i
too
much
of
a
baby
to
understand
so
they
two
sat
there
in
the
old
valley
until
the
evening
star
shone
through
a
gauzy
cloud
over
the
maple
grove
and
a
fragrant
dewy
darkness
filled
their
little
sylvan
dell
it
was
one
of
the
evenings
rilla
was
to
treasure
in
remembrance
all
her
life
the
first
one
on
which
walter
had
ever
talked
to
her
as
if
she
were
a
woman
and
not
a
child
they
comforted
and
strengthened
each
other
walter
felt
for
the
time
being
at
least
that
it
was
not
such
a
despicable
thing
after
all
to
dread
the
horror
of
war
and
rilla
was
glad
to
be
made
the
confidante
of
his
struggles
to
sympathize
with
and
encourage
him
she
was
of
importance
to
somebody
when
they
went
back
to
ingleside
they
found
callers
sitting
on
the
veranda
and
meredith
had
come
over
from
the
manse
and
and
norman
douglas
had
come
up
from
the
farm
cousin
sophia
was
there
also
sitting
with
susan
in
the
shadowy
background
blythe
and
nan
and
di
were
away
but
blythe
was
home
and
so
was
jekyll
sitting
in
golden
majesty
on
the
top
step
and
of
course
they
were
all
talking
of
the
war
except
jekyll
who
kept
his
own
counsel
and
looked
contempt
as
only
a
cat
can
when
two
people
foregathered
in
those
days
they
talked
of
the
war
and
old
highland
sandy
of
the
harbour
head
talked
of
it
when
he
was
alone
and
hurled
anathemas
at
the
kaiser
across
all
the
acres
of
his
farm
walter
slipped
away
not
caring
to
see
or
be
seen
but
rilla
sat
down
on
the
steps
where
the
garden
mint
was
dewy
and
pungent
it
was
a
very
calm
evening
with
a
dim
golden
afterlight
irradiating
the
glen
she
felt
happier
than
at
any
time
in
the
dreadful
week
that
had
passed
she
was
no
longer
haunted
by
the
fear
that
walter
would
go
i
go
myself
if
i
was
twenty
years
younger
norman
douglas
was
shouting
norman
always
shouted
when
he
was
excited
i
show
the
kaiser
a
thing
or
two
did
i
ever
say
there
was
a
hell
of
course
there
a
hell
dozens
of
hells
hundreds
of
hells
where
the
kaiser
and
all
his
brood
are
bound
for
i
knew
this
war
was
coming
said
norman
triumphantly
i
saw
it
coming
right
along
i
could
have
told
all
those
stupid
englishmen
what
was
ahead
of
them
i
told
you
john
meredith
years
ago
what
the
kaiser
was
up
to
but
you
would
believe
it
you
said
he
would
never
plunge
the
world
in
war
who
was
right
about
the
kaiser
john
you
or
i
tell
me
that
you
were
i
admit
said
meredith
it
too
late
to
admit
it
now
said
norman
shaking
her
head
as
if
to
intimate
that
if
john
meredith
had
admitted
it
sooner
there
might
have
been
no
war
thank
god
england
navy
is
ready
said
the
doctor
amen
to
that
nodded
norman
as
most
of
them
were
somebody
had
foresight
enough
to
see
to
that
maybe
england
manage
not
to
get
into
trouble
over
it
said
cousin
sophia
plaintively
i
dunno
but
i
much
afraid
one
would
suppose
that
england
was
in
trouble
over
it
already
up
to
her
neck
sophia
crawford
said
susan
but
your
ways
of
thinking
are
beyond
me
and
always
were
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
british
navy
will
settle
germany
in
a
jiffy
and
that
we
are
all
getting
worked
up
over
nothing
susan
spat
out
the
words
as
if
she
wanted
to
convince
herself
more
than
anybody
else
she
had
her
little
store
of
homely
philosophies
to
guide
her
through
life
but
she
had
nothing
to
buckler
her
against
the
thunderbolts
of
the
week
that
had
just
passed
what
had
an
honest
presbyterian
old
maid
of
glen
mary
to
do
with
a
war
thousands
of
miles
away
susan
felt
that
it
was
indecent
that
she
should
have
to
be
disturbed
by
it
the
british
army
will
settle
germany
shouted
norman
just
wait
till
it
gets
into
line
and
the
kaiser
will
find
that
real
war
is
a
different
thing
from
parading
round
berlin
with
your
moustaches
cocked
up
britain
has
got
an
army
said
norman
emphatically
you
need
glare
at
me
norman
glaring
wo
make
soldiers
out
of
timothy
stalks
a
hundred
thousand
men
will
just
be
a
mouthful
for
millions
there
be
some
tough
chewing
in
the
mouthful
i
reckon
persisted
norman
valiantly
germany
break
her
teeth
on
it
do
you
tell
me
one
britisher
is
a
match
for
ten
foreigners
i
could
polish
off
a
dozen
of
myself
with
both
hands
tied
behind
my
back
i
am
told
said
susan
that
old
pryor
does
not
believe
in
this
war
i
am
told
that
he
says
england
went
into
it
just
because
she
was
jealous
of
germany
and
that
she
did
not
really
care
in
the
least
what
happened
to
belgium
i
believe
he
been
talking
some
such
rot
said
norman
i
heard
him
when
i
do
wo
know
what
happened
to
him
that
precious
relative
of
mine
kitty
alec
holds
forth
to
the
same
effect
i
understand
not
before
me
though
somehow
folks
indulge
in
that
kind
of
conversation
in
my
presence
lord
love
you
they
a
kind
of
presentiment
so
to
speak
that
it
would
be
healthy
for
their
complaint
i
am
much
afraid
that
this
war
has
been
sent
as
a
punishment
for
our
sins
said
cousin
sophia
unclasping
her
pale
hands
from
her
lap
and
reclasping
them
solemnly
over
her
stomach
world
is
very
evil
the
times
are
waxing
late
parson
here
got
something
of
the
same
idea
chuckled
norman
have
you
parson
that
why
you
preached
night
on
the
text
shedding
of
blood
there
is
no
remission
of
sins
i
agree
with
you
wanted
to
get
up
in
the
pew
and
shout
out
that
there
was
a
word
of
sense
in
what
you
were
saying
but
ellen
here
she
held
me
down
i
never
have
any
fun
sassing
parsons
since
i
got
married
without
shedding
of
blood
there
is
no
anything
said
meredith
in
the
gentle
dreamy
way
which
had
an
unexpected
trick
of
convincing
his
hearers
everything
it
seems
to
me
has
to
be
purchased
by
our
race
has
marked
every
step
of
its
painful
ascent
with
blood
and
now
torrents
of
it
must
flow
again
no
crawford
i
do
think
the
war
has
been
sent
as
a
punishment
for
sin
i
think
it
is
the
price
humanity
must
pay
for
some
blessing
some
advance
great
enough
to
be
worth
the
price
which
we
may
not
live
to
see
but
which
our
children
children
will
inherit
if
jerry
is
killed
will
you
feel
so
fine
about
it
demanded
norman
who
had
been
saying
things
like
that
all
his
life
and
never
could
be
made
to
see
any
reason
why
he
should
now
never
mind
kicking
me
in
the
shins
ellen
i
want
to
see
if
parson
meant
what
he
said
or
if
it
was
just
a
pulpit
frill
meredith
face
quivered
he
had
had
a
terrible
hour
alone
in
his
study
on
the
night
jem
and
jerry
had
gone
to
town
but
he
answered
quietly
whatever
i
felt
it
could
not
alter
my
belief
my
assurance
that
a
country
whose
sons
are
ready
to
lay
down
their
lives
in
her
defence
will
win
a
new
vision
because
of
their
sacrifice
you
do
mean
it
parson
i
can
always
tell
when
people
mean
what
they
say
it
a
gift
that
was
born
in
me
makes
me
a
terror
to
most
parsons
that
but
i
never
caught
you
yet
saying
anything
you
mean
i
always
hoping
i
will
that
what
reconciles
me
to
going
to
church
it
be
such
a
comfort
to
me
such
a
weapon
to
batter
ellen
here
with
when
she
tries
to
civilize
me
well
i
off
over
the
road
to
see
ab
crawford
a
minute
the
gods
be
good
to
you
all
the
old
pagan
muttered
susan
as
norman
strode
away
she
did
not
care
if
ellen
douglas
did
hear
her
susan
could
never
understand
why
fire
did
not
descend
from
heaven
upon
norman
douglas
when
he
insulted
ministers
the
way
he
did
but
the
astonishing
thing
was
meredith
seemed
really
to
like
his
rilla
wished
they
would
talk
of
something
besides
war
she
had
heard
nothing
else
for
a
week
and
she
was
really
a
little
tired
of
it
now
that
she
was
relieved
from
her
haunting
fear
that
walter
would
want
to
go
it
made
her
quite
impatient
but
she
supposed
with
a
sigh
that
there
would
be
three
or
four
months
of
it
yet
chapter
vi
susan
rilla
and
dog
monday
make
a
resolution
the
big
at
ingleside
was
snowed
over
with
drifts
of
white
cotton
word
had
come
from
red
cross
headquarters
that
sheets
and
bandages
would
be
required
nan
and
di
and
rilla
were
hard
at
work
blythe
and
susan
were
upstairs
in
the
boys
room
engaged
in
a
more
personal
task
with
dry
anguished
eyes
they
were
packing
up
belongings
he
must
leave
for
valcartier
the
next
morning
they
had
been
expecting
the
word
but
it
was
none
the
less
dreadful
when
it
came
rilla
was
basting
the
hem
of
a
sheet
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
when
the
word
had
come
that
jem
must
go
she
had
her
cry
out
among
the
pines
in
rainbow
valley
and
then
she
had
gone
to
her
mother
mother
i
want
to
do
something
i
only
a
girl
i
ca
do
anything
to
win
the
war
but
i
must
do
something
to
help
at
home
the
cotton
has
come
up
for
the
sheets
said
blythe
you
can
help
nan
and
di
make
them
up
and
rilla
do
you
think
you
could
organize
a
junior
red
cross
among
the
young
girls
i
think
they
would
like
it
better
and
do
better
work
by
themselves
than
if
mixed
up
with
the
older
people
but
mother
i
never
done
anything
like
that
we
will
all
have
to
do
a
great
many
things
in
the
months
ahead
of
us
that
we
have
never
done
before
rilla
well
rilla
took
the
plunge
i
try
mother
if
you
tell
me
how
to
begin
i
have
been
thinking
it
all
over
and
i
have
decided
that
i
must
be
as
brave
and
heroic
and
unselfish
as
i
can
possibly
be
blythe
did
not
smile
at
rilla
italics
perhaps
she
did
not
feel
like
smiling
or
perhaps
she
detected
a
real
grain
of
serious
purpose
behind
rilla
romantic
pose
so
here
was
rilla
hemming
sheets
and
organizing
a
junior
red
cross
in
her
thoughts
as
she
hemmed
moreover
she
was
enjoying
it
the
organizing
that
is
not
the
hemming
it
was
interesting
and
rilla
discovered
a
certain
aptitude
in
herself
for
it
that
surprised
her
who
would
be
president
not
she
the
older
girls
would
not
like
that
irene
howard
no
somehow
irene
was
not
quite
as
popular
as
she
deserved
to
be
marjorie
drew
no
marjorie
enough
backbone
she
was
too
prone
to
agree
with
the
last
speaker
betty
mead
calm
capable
tactful
betty
the
very
one
and
una
meredith
for
treasurer
and
if
they
were
very
insistent
they
might
make
her
rilla
secretary
as
for
the
various
committees
they
must
be
chosen
after
the
juniors
were
organized
but
rilla
knew
just
who
should
be
put
on
which
they
would
meet
around
and
there
must
be
no
eats
rilla
knew
she
would
have
a
pitched
battle
with
olive
kirk
over
that
and
everything
should
be
strictly
and
constitutional
her
minute
book
should
be
covered
in
white
with
a
red
cross
on
the
cover
and
would
it
be
nice
to
have
some
kind
of
uniform
which
they
could
all
wear
at
the
concerts
they
would
have
to
get
up
to
raise
money
something
simple
but
smart
you
have
basted
the
top
hem
of
that
sheet
on
one
side
and
the
bottom
hem
on
the
other
said
di
rilla
picked
out
her
stitches
and
reflected
that
she
hated
sewing
running
the
junior
reds
would
be
much
more
interesting
blythe
was
saying
upstairs
susan
do
you
remember
that
first
day
jem
lifted
up
his
little
arms
to
me
and
called
me
the
very
first
word
he
ever
tried
to
say
you
could
not
mention
anything
about
that
blessed
baby
that
i
do
not
and
will
not
remember
till
my
dying
day
said
susan
drearily
susan
i
keep
thinking
today
of
once
when
he
cried
for
me
in
the
night
he
was
just
a
few
months
old
gilbert
did
want
me
to
go
to
him
he
said
the
child
was
well
and
warm
and
that
it
would
be
fostering
bad
habits
in
him
but
i
went
and
took
him
up
i
can
feel
that
tight
clinging
of
his
little
arms
round
my
neck
yet
susan
if
i
had
gone
that
night
years
ago
and
taken
my
baby
up
when
he
cried
for
me
i
could
face
tomorrow
morning
i
do
not
know
how
we
are
going
to
face
it
anyhow
dear
but
do
not
tell
me
that
it
will
be
the
final
farewell
he
will
be
back
on
leave
before
he
goes
overseas
will
he
not
we
hope
so
but
we
are
not
very
sure
i
am
making
up
my
mind
that
he
will
not
so
that
there
will
be
no
disappointment
to
bear
susan
i
am
determined
that
i
will
send
my
boy
off
tomorrow
with
a
smile
he
shall
not
carry
away
with
him
the
remembrance
of
a
weak
mother
who
had
not
the
courage
to
send
when
he
had
the
courage
to
go
i
hope
none
of
us
will
cry
i
am
not
going
to
cry
dear
and
that
you
may
tie
to
but
whether
i
shall
manage
to
smile
or
not
will
be
as
providence
ordains
and
as
the
pit
of
my
stomach
feels
have
you
room
there
for
this
and
the
shortbread
and
the
that
blessed
boy
shall
not
starve
whether
they
have
anything
to
eat
in
that
quebec
place
or
not
everything
seems
to
be
changing
all
at
once
does
it
not
even
the
old
cat
at
the
manse
has
passed
away
he
breathed
his
last
at
a
quarter
to
ten
last
night
and
bruce
is
quite
they
tell
me
it
time
that
pussy
went
where
good
cats
go
he
must
be
at
least
fifteen
years
old
he
has
seemed
so
lonely
since
aunt
martha
died
i
should
not
have
lamented
dear
if
that
had
died
also
he
has
been
hyde
most
of
the
time
since
jem
came
home
in
khaki
and
that
has
a
meaning
i
will
maintain
i
do
not
know
what
monday
will
do
when
jem
is
gone
the
creature
just
goes
about
with
a
human
look
in
his
eyes
that
takes
all
the
good
out
of
me
when
i
see
it
ellen
west
used
to
be
always
railing
at
the
kaiser
and
we
thought
her
crazy
but
now
i
see
that
there
was
a
method
in
her
madness
this
tray
is
packed
dear
and
i
will
go
down
and
put
in
my
best
licks
preparing
supper
i
wish
i
knew
when
i
would
cook
another
supper
for
jem
but
such
things
are
hidden
from
our
eyes
jem
blythe
and
jerry
meredith
left
next
morning
it
was
a
dull
day
threatening
rain
and
the
clouds
lay
in
heavy
grey
rolls
over
the
sky
but
almost
everybody
in
the
glen
and
four
winds
and
harbour
head
and
upper
glen
and
except
was
there
to
see
them
off
the
blythe
family
and
the
meredith
family
were
all
smiling
even
susan
as
providence
did
ordain
wore
a
smile
though
the
effect
was
somewhat
more
painful
than
tears
would
have
been
faith
and
nan
were
very
pale
and
very
gallant
rilla
thought
she
would
get
on
very
well
if
something
in
her
throat
did
choke
her
and
if
her
lips
did
take
such
spells
of
trembling
dog
monday
was
there
too
jem
had
tried
to
say
to
him
at
ingleside
but
monday
implored
so
eloquently
that
jem
relented
and
let
him
go
to
the
station
he
kept
close
to
jem
legs
and
watched
every
movement
of
his
beloved
master
i
ca
bear
that
dog
eyes
said
meredith
the
beast
has
more
sense
than
most
humans
said
mary
vance
well
did
we
any
of
us
ever
think
we
live
to
see
this
day
i
bawled
all
night
to
think
of
jem
and
jerry
going
like
this
i
think
they
plumb
deranged
miller
got
a
maggot
in
his
head
about
going
but
i
soon
talked
him
out
of
it
likewise
his
aunt
said
a
few
touching
things
for
once
in
our
lives
kitty
alec
and
i
agree
it
a
miracle
that
is
likely
to
happen
again
there
ken
rilla
rilla
knew
kenneth
was
there
she
had
been
acutely
conscious
of
it
from
the
moment
he
had
sprung
from
leo
west
buggy
now
he
came
up
to
her
smiling
doing
the
i
see
what
a
crowd
for
the
glen
to
muster
well
i
off
home
in
a
few
days
myself
a
queer
little
wind
of
desolation
that
even
jem
going
had
not
caused
blew
over
rilla
spirit
why
you
have
another
month
of
vacation
yes
but
i
ca
hang
around
four
winds
and
enjoy
myself
when
the
world
on
fire
like
this
it
me
for
little
old
toronto
where
find
some
way
of
helping
in
spite
of
this
bally
ankle
i
not
looking
at
jem
and
jerry
makes
me
too
sick
with
envy
you
girls
are
great
no
crying
no
grim
endurance
the
boys
go
off
with
a
good
taste
in
their
mouths
i
hope
persis
and
mother
will
be
as
game
when
my
turn
comes
oh
kenneth
the
war
will
be
over
before
your
turn
cometh
there
she
had
lisped
again
another
great
moment
of
life
spoiled
well
it
was
her
fate
and
anyhow
nothing
mattered
kenneth
was
off
already
he
was
talking
to
ethel
reese
who
was
dressed
at
seven
in
the
morning
in
the
gown
she
had
worn
to
the
dance
and
was
crying
what
on
earth
had
ethel
to
cry
about
none
of
the
reeses
were
in
khaki
rilla
wanted
to
cry
too
but
she
would
not
what
was
that
horrid
old
drew
saying
to
mother
in
that
melancholy
whine
of
hers
i
know
how
you
can
stand
this
blythe
i
could
if
it
was
my
pore
boy
and
mother
oh
mother
could
always
be
depended
on
how
her
grey
eyes
flashed
in
her
pale
face
it
might
have
been
worse
drew
i
might
have
had
to
urge
him
to
go
drew
did
not
understand
but
rilla
did
she
flung
up
her
head
her
brother
did
not
have
to
be
urged
to
go
rilla
found
herself
standing
alone
and
listening
to
disconnected
scraps
of
talk
as
people
walked
up
and
down
past
her
i
told
mark
to
wait
and
see
if
they
asked
for
a
second
lot
of
men
if
they
did
i
let
him
go
but
they
wo
said
palmer
burr
i
think
i
have
it
made
with
a
crush
girdle
of
velvet
said
bessie
clow
i
frightened
to
look
at
my
husband
face
for
fear
i
see
in
it
that
he
wants
to
go
too
said
a
little
bride
i
scared
stiff
said
whimsical
jim
howard
i
scared
jim
will
enlist
and
i
scared
he
wo
the
war
will
be
over
by
christmas
said
joe
vickers
let
them
european
nations
fight
it
out
between
them
said
abner
reese
when
he
was
a
boy
i
gave
him
many
a
good
trouncing
shouted
norman
douglas
who
seemed
to
be
referring
to
some
one
high
in
military
circles
in
charlottetown
yes
sir
i
walloped
him
well
big
gun
as
he
is
now
the
existence
of
the
british
empire
is
at
stake
said
the
methodist
minister
there
certainly
something
about
uniforms
sighed
irene
howard
it
a
commercial
war
when
all
is
said
and
done
and
not
worth
one
drop
of
good
canadian
blood
said
a
stranger
from
the
shore
hotel
the
blythe
family
are
taking
it
easy
said
kate
drew
them
young
fools
are
just
going
for
adventure
growled
nathan
crawford
i
have
absolute
confidence
in
kitchener
said
the
doctor
in
these
ten
minutes
rilla
passed
through
a
dizzying
succession
of
anger
laughter
contempt
depression
and
inspiration
oh
people
were
funny
how
little
they
understood
taking
it
easy
indeed
when
even
susan
had
slept
a
wink
all
night
kate
drew
always
was
a
minx
rilla
felt
as
if
she
were
in
some
fantastic
nightmare
were
these
the
people
who
three
weeks
ago
were
talking
of
crops
and
prices
and
local
gossip
there
the
train
was
coming
mother
was
holding
jem
hand
dog
monday
was
licking
it
everybody
was
saying
the
train
was
in
jem
kissed
faith
before
everybody
old
drew
whooped
hysterically
the
men
led
by
kenneth
cheered
rilla
felt
jem
seize
her
hand
spider
somebody
kissed
her
cheek
she
believed
it
was
jerry
but
never
was
sure
they
were
off
the
train
was
pulling
out
jem
and
jerry
were
waving
to
everybody
everybody
was
waving
back
mother
and
nan
were
smiling
still
but
as
if
they
had
just
forgotten
to
take
the
smile
off
monday
was
howling
dismally
and
being
forcibly
restrained
by
the
methodist
minister
from
tearing
after
the
train
susan
was
waving
her
best
bonnet
and
hurrahing
like
a
man
had
she
gone
crazy
the
train
rounded
a
curve
they
had
gone
rilla
came
to
herself
with
a
gasp
there
was
a
sudden
quiet
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
go
home
and
wait
the
doctor
and
blythe
walked
off
together
so
did
nan
and
faith
so
did
john
meredith
and
rosemary
walter
and
una
and
shirley
and
di
and
carl
and
rilla
went
in
a
group
susan
had
put
her
bonnet
back
on
her
head
hindside
foremost
and
stalked
grimly
off
alone
nobody
missed
dog
monday
at
first
when
they
did
shirley
went
back
for
him
he
found
dog
monday
curled
up
in
one
of
the
near
the
station
and
tried
to
coax
him
home
dog
monday
would
not
move
he
wagged
his
tail
to
show
he
had
no
hard
feelings
but
no
blandishments
availed
to
budge
him
guess
monday
has
made
up
his
mind
to
wait
there
till
jem
comes
back
said
shirley
trying
to
laugh
as
he
rejoined
the
rest
this
was
exactly
what
dog
monday
had
done
his
dear
master
had
gone
he
monday
had
been
deliberately
and
of
malice
aforethought
prevented
from
going
with
him
by
a
demon
disguised
in
the
garb
of
a
methodist
minister
wherefore
he
monday
would
wait
there
until
the
smoking
snorting
monster
which
had
carried
his
hero
off
carried
him
back
ay
wait
there
little
faithful
dog
with
the
soft
wistful
puzzled
eyes
but
it
will
be
many
a
long
bitter
day
before
your
boyish
comrade
comes
back
to
you
the
doctor
was
away
on
a
case
that
night
and
susan
stalked
into
blythe
room
on
her
way
to
bed
to
see
if
her
adored
dear
were
comfortable
and
composed
she
paused
solemnly
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
solemnly
declared
dear
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
be
a
heroine
dear
found
herself
violently
inclined
to
laugh
which
was
manifestly
unfair
since
she
had
not
laughed
when
rilla
had
announced
a
similar
heroic
determination
to
be
sure
rilla
was
a
slim
thing
with
a
face
and
starry
young
eyes
aglow
with
feeling
whereas
susan
was
arrayed
in
a
grey
flannel
nightgown
of
strait
simplicity
and
had
a
strip
of
red
woollen
worsted
tied
around
her
grey
hair
as
a
charm
against
neuralgia
but
that
should
not
make
any
vital
difference
was
it
not
the
spirit
that
counted
yet
blythe
was
hard
put
to
it
not
to
laugh
i
am
not
proceeded
susan
firmly
going
to
lament
or
whine
or
question
the
wisdom
of
the
almighty
any
more
as
i
have
been
doing
lately
whining
and
shirking
and
blaming
providence
do
not
get
us
anywhere
we
have
just
got
to
grapple
with
whatever
we
have
to
do
whether
it
is
weeding
the
onion
patch
or
running
the
government
i
shall
grapple
those
blessed
boys
have
gone
to
war
and
we
women
dear
must
tarry
by
the
stuff
and
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
chapter
vii
a
and
a
soup
tureen
liege
and
namur
and
now
brussels
the
doctor
shook
his
head
i
do
like
it
i
do
like
it
do
not
you
lose
heart
dear
they
were
just
defended
by
foreigners
said
susan
superbly
wait
you
till
the
germans
come
against
the
british
there
will
be
a
very
different
story
to
tell
and
that
you
may
tie
to
the
doctor
shook
his
head
again
but
a
little
less
gravely
perhaps
they
all
shared
subconsciously
in
susan
belief
that
the
thin
grey
line
was
unbreakable
even
by
the
victorious
rush
of
germany
ready
millions
at
any
rate
when
the
terrible
day
came
the
first
of
many
terrible
days
with
the
news
that
the
british
army
was
driven
back
they
stared
at
each
other
in
blank
dismay
it
it
ca
be
true
gasped
nan
taking
a
brief
refuge
in
temporary
incredulity
i
felt
that
there
was
to
be
bad
news
today
said
susan
for
that
turned
into
hyde
this
morning
without
rhyme
or
reason
for
it
and
that
was
no
good
omen
broken
a
beaten
but
not
a
demoralized
army
muttered
the
doctor
from
a
london
dispatch
can
it
be
england
army
of
which
such
a
thing
is
said
it
will
be
a
long
time
now
before
the
war
is
ended
said
blythe
despairingly
susan
faith
which
had
for
a
moment
been
temporarily
submerged
now
reappeared
triumphantly
remember
dear
that
the
british
army
is
not
the
british
navy
never
forget
that
and
the
russians
are
on
their
way
too
though
russians
are
people
i
do
not
know
much
about
and
consequently
will
not
tie
to
the
russians
will
not
be
in
time
to
save
paris
said
walter
gloomily
paris
is
the
heart
of
france
and
the
road
to
it
is
open
oh
i
wish
he
stopped
abruptly
and
went
out
after
a
paralysed
day
the
ingleside
folk
found
it
was
possible
to
carry
on
even
in
the
face
of
bad
news
susan
worked
fiercely
in
her
kitchen
the
doctor
went
out
on
his
round
of
visits
nan
and
di
returned
to
their
red
cross
activities
blythe
went
to
charlottetown
to
attend
a
red
cross
convention
rilla
after
relieving
her
feelings
by
a
stormy
fit
of
tears
in
rainbow
valley
and
an
outburst
in
her
diary
remembered
that
she
had
elected
to
be
brave
and
heroic
and
she
thought
it
really
was
heroic
to
volunteer
to
drive
about
the
glen
and
four
winds
one
day
collecting
promised
red
cross
supplies
with
abner
crawford
old
grey
horse
one
of
the
ingleside
horses
was
lame
and
the
doctor
needed
the
other
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
the
crawford
nag
a
placid
unhasting
creature
with
an
amiable
habit
of
stopping
every
few
yards
to
kick
a
fly
off
one
leg
with
the
foot
of
the
other
rilla
felt
that
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
germans
were
only
fifty
miles
from
paris
was
hardly
to
be
endured
but
she
started
off
gallantly
on
an
errand
fraught
with
amazing
results
late
in
the
afternoon
she
found
herself
with
a
buggy
full
of
parcels
at
the
entrance
to
a
grassy
lane
leading
to
the
harbour
shore
wondering
whether
it
was
worth
while
to
call
down
at
the
anderson
house
the
andersons
were
desperately
poor
and
it
was
not
likely
anderson
had
anything
to
give
on
the
other
hand
her
husband
who
was
an
englishman
by
birth
and
who
had
been
working
in
kingsport
when
the
war
broke
out
had
promptly
sailed
for
england
to
enlist
there
without
it
may
be
said
coming
home
or
sending
much
hard
cash
to
represent
him
so
possibly
anderson
might
feel
hurt
if
she
were
overlooked
rilla
decided
to
call
there
were
times
afterwards
when
she
wished
she
had
but
in
the
long
run
she
was
very
thankful
that
she
did
the
anderson
house
was
a
small
and
tumbledown
affair
crouching
in
a
grove
of
battered
spruces
near
the
shore
as
if
rather
ashamed
of
itself
and
anxious
to
hide
rilla
tied
her
grey
nag
to
the
rickety
fence
and
went
to
the
door
it
was
open
and
the
sight
she
saw
bereft
her
temporarily
of
the
power
of
speech
or
motion
through
the
open
door
of
the
small
bedroom
opposite
her
rilla
saw
anderson
lying
on
the
untidy
bed
and
anderson
was
dead
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
neither
was
there
any
doubt
that
the
big
frowzy
woman
sitting
near
the
smoking
a
pipe
quite
comfortably
was
very
much
alive
she
rocked
idly
back
and
forth
amid
her
surroundings
of
squalid
disorder
and
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
the
piercing
wails
proceeding
from
a
cradle
in
the
middle
of
the
room
rilla
knew
the
woman
by
sight
and
reputation
her
name
was
conover
she
lived
down
at
the
fishing
village
she
was
a
of
anderson
and
she
drank
as
well
as
smoked
rilla
first
impulse
was
to
turn
and
flee
but
that
would
never
do
perhaps
this
woman
repulsive
as
she
was
needed
help
though
she
certainly
did
not
look
as
if
she
were
worrying
over
the
lack
of
it
come
in
said
conover
removing
her
pipe
and
staring
at
rilla
with
her
little
eyes
is
is
anderson
really
dead
asked
rilla
timidly
as
she
stepped
over
the
sill
dead
as
a
door
nail
responded
conover
cheerfully
kicked
the
bucket
half
an
hour
ago
i
sent
jen
conover
to
for
the
undertaker
and
get
some
help
up
from
the
shore
you
the
miss
ai
ye
have
a
cheer
rilla
did
not
see
any
chair
which
was
not
cluttered
with
something
she
remained
standing
was
it
very
sudden
well
she
been
ever
since
that
worthless
jim
lit
out
for
england
which
i
say
it
a
pity
as
he
ever
left
it
my
belief
she
was
took
for
death
when
she
heard
the
news
that
young
un
there
was
born
a
fortnight
ago
and
since
then
she
just
gone
down
and
today
she
up
and
died
without
a
soul
expecting
it
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
to
help
hesitated
rilla
bless
yez
no
unless
ye
a
knack
with
kids
i
have
that
young
un
there
never
lets
up
squalling
day
or
night
i
just
got
that
i
take
no
notice
of
it
rilla
tiptoed
gingerly
over
to
the
cradle
and
more
gingerly
still
pulled
down
the
dirty
blanket
she
had
no
intention
of
touching
the
baby
she
had
no
knack
with
kids
either
she
saw
an
ugly
midget
with
a
red
distorted
little
face
rolled
up
in
a
piece
of
dingy
old
flannel
she
had
never
seen
an
uglier
baby
yet
a
feeling
of
pity
for
the
desolate
orphaned
mite
which
had
come
out
of
the
everywhere
into
such
a
dubious
here
took
sudden
possession
of
her
what
is
going
to
become
of
the
baby
she
asked
lord
knows
said
conover
candidly
min
worried
awful
over
that
before
she
died
she
kept
on
what
will
become
of
my
pore
baby
till
it
really
got
on
my
nerves
i
ai
to
trouble
myself
with
it
i
can
tell
yez
i
brung
up
a
boy
that
my
sister
left
and
he
skinned
out
as
soon
as
he
got
to
be
some
good
and
wo
give
me
a
mite
o
help
in
my
old
age
ungrateful
whelp
as
he
is
i
told
min
it
have
to
be
sent
to
an
orphan
asylum
till
we
see
if
jim
ever
came
back
to
look
after
it
would
yez
believe
it
she
did
relish
the
idee
but
that
the
long
and
short
of
it
but
who
will
look
after
it
until
it
can
be
taken
to
the
asylum
persisted
rilla
somehow
the
baby
fate
worried
her
i
have
to
grunted
conover
she
put
away
her
pipe
and
took
an
unblushing
swig
from
a
black
bottle
she
produced
from
a
shelf
near
her
it
my
opinion
the
kid
wo
live
long
it
sickly
min
never
had
no
gimp
and
i
guess
it
hai
either
likely
it
wo
trouble
any
one
long
and
good
riddance
sez
i
rilla
drew
the
blanket
down
a
little
farther
why
the
baby
is
dressed
she
exclaimed
in
a
shocked
tone
who
was
to
dress
him
i
like
to
know
demanded
conover
truculently
i
had
time
took
me
all
the
time
there
was
looking
after
min
as
i
told
yez
i
do
know
nithing
about
kids
old
billy
crawford
she
was
here
when
it
was
born
and
she
washed
it
and
rolled
it
up
in
that
flannel
and
jen
she
tended
it
a
bit
since
the
critter
is
warm
enough
this
weather
would
melt
a
brass
monkey
rilla
was
silent
looking
down
at
the
crying
baby
she
had
never
encountered
any
of
the
tragedies
of
life
before
and
this
one
smote
her
to
the
core
of
her
heart
the
thought
of
the
poor
mother
going
down
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
alone
fretting
about
her
baby
with
no
one
near
but
this
abominable
old
woman
hurt
her
terribly
if
she
had
only
come
a
little
sooner
yet
what
could
she
have
done
what
could
she
do
now
she
did
know
but
she
must
do
something
she
hated
babies
but
she
simply
could
not
go
away
and
leave
that
poor
little
creature
with
conover
who
was
applying
herself
again
to
her
black
bottle
and
would
probably
be
helplessly
drunk
before
anybody
came
i
ca
stay
thought
rilla
crawford
said
i
must
be
home
by
because
he
wanted
the
pony
this
evening
himself
oh
what
can
i
do
she
made
a
sudden
desperate
impulsive
resolution
i
take
the
baby
home
with
me
she
said
can
i
sure
if
yez
wants
to
said
conover
amiably
i
hai
any
objection
take
it
and
welcome
i
i
ca
carry
it
said
rilla
i
have
to
drive
the
horse
and
be
afraid
i
drop
it
is
there
a
a
basket
anywhere
that
i
could
put
it
in
not
as
i
knows
on
there
ai
much
here
of
anything
i
kin
tell
yez
min
was
pore
and
as
shiftless
as
jim
ef
ye
opens
that
drawer
over
there
yez
find
a
few
baby
best
take
them
along
rilla
got
the
clothes
the
cheap
sleazy
garments
the
poor
mother
had
made
ready
as
best
she
could
but
this
did
not
solve
the
pressing
problem
of
the
baby
transportation
rilla
looked
helplessly
round
oh
for
mother
or
susan
her
eyes
fell
on
an
enormous
blue
soup
tureen
at
the
back
of
the
dresser
may
i
have
this
to
to
lay
him
in
she
asked
well
mine
but
i
guess
yez
kin
take
it
do
smash
it
if
yez
can
help
jim
might
make
a
fuss
about
it
if
he
comes
back
alive
which
he
sure
will
seein
he
ai
any
good
he
brung
that
old
tureen
out
from
england
with
him
said
it
always
been
in
the
family
him
and
min
never
used
it
never
had
enough
soup
to
put
in
it
but
jim
thought
the
world
of
it
he
was
mighty
perticuler
about
some
things
but
worry
him
none
that
there
were
much
in
the
way
o
eatables
to
put
in
the
dishes
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
rilla
blythe
touched
a
baby
lifted
it
rolled
it
in
a
blanket
trembling
with
nervousness
lest
she
drop
it
or
or
break
it
then
she
put
it
in
the
soup
tureen
is
there
any
fear
of
it
smothering
she
asked
anxiously
not
much
odds
if
it
do
said
conover
horrified
rilla
loosened
the
blanket
round
the
baby
face
a
little
the
mite
had
stopped
crying
and
was
blinking
up
at
her
it
had
big
dark
eyes
in
its
ugly
little
face
better
not
let
the
wind
blow
on
it
admonished
conover
take
its
breath
if
it
do
rilla
wrapped
the
tattered
little
quilt
around
the
soup
tureen
will
you
hand
this
to
me
after
i
get
into
the
buggy
please
sure
i
will
said
conover
getting
up
with
a
grunt
and
so
it
was
that
rilla
blythe
who
had
driven
to
the
anderson
house
a
hater
of
babies
drove
away
from
it
carrying
one
in
a
soup
tureen
on
her
lap
rilla
thought
she
would
never
get
to
ingleside
in
the
soup
tureen
there
was
an
uncanny
silence
in
one
way
she
was
thankful
the
baby
did
not
cry
but
she
wished
it
would
give
an
occasional
squeak
to
prove
that
it
was
alive
suppose
it
were
smothered
rilla
dared
not
unwrap
it
to
see
lest
the
wind
which
was
now
blowing
a
hurricane
should
take
its
breath
whatever
dreadful
thing
that
might
be
she
was
a
thankful
girl
when
at
last
she
reached
harbour
at
ingleside
rilla
carried
the
soup
tureen
to
the
kitchen
and
set
it
on
the
table
under
susan
eyes
susan
looked
into
the
tureen
and
for
once
in
her
life
was
so
completely
floored
that
she
had
not
a
word
to
say
what
in
the
world
is
this
asked
the
doctor
coming
in
rilla
poured
out
her
story
i
just
had
to
bring
it
father
she
concluded
i
could
leave
it
there
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
asked
the
doctor
coolly
rilla
had
exactly
expected
this
kind
of
question
we
we
can
keep
it
here
for
awhile
ca
we
until
something
can
be
arranged
she
stammered
confusedly
blythe
walked
up
and
down
the
kitchen
for
a
moment
or
two
while
the
baby
stared
at
the
white
walls
of
the
soup
tureen
and
susan
showed
signs
of
returning
animation
presently
the
doctor
confronted
rilla
a
young
baby
means
a
great
deal
of
additional
work
and
trouble
in
a
household
rilla
nan
and
di
are
leaving
for
redmond
next
week
and
neither
your
mother
nor
susan
is
able
to
assume
so
much
extra
care
under
present
conditions
if
you
want
to
keep
that
baby
here
you
must
attend
to
it
yourself
me
rilla
was
dismayed
into
being
ungrammatical
why
father
i
i
could
younger
girls
than
you
have
had
to
look
after
babies
my
advice
and
susan
is
at
your
disposal
if
you
can
not
then
the
baby
must
go
back
to
meg
conover
its
lease
of
life
will
be
short
if
it
does
for
it
is
evident
that
it
is
a
delicate
child
and
requires
particular
care
i
doubt
if
it
would
survive
even
if
sent
to
an
orphans
home
but
i
can
not
have
your
mother
and
susan
the
doctor
walked
out
of
the
kitchen
looking
very
stern
and
immovable
in
his
heart
he
knew
quite
well
that
the
small
inhabitant
of
the
big
soup
tureen
would
remain
at
ingleside
but
he
meant
to
see
if
rilla
could
not
be
induced
to
rise
to
the
occasion
rilla
sat
looking
blankly
at
the
baby
it
was
absurd
to
think
she
could
take
care
of
it
but
that
poor
little
frail
dead
mother
who
had
worried
about
it
that
dreadful
old
meg
conover
susan
what
must
be
done
for
a
baby
she
asked
dolefully
you
must
keep
it
warm
and
dry
and
wash
it
every
day
and
be
sure
the
water
is
neither
too
hot
nor
too
cold
and
feed
it
every
two
hours
if
it
has
colic
you
put
hot
things
on
its
stomach
said
susan
rather
feebly
and
flatly
for
her
the
baby
began
to
cry
again
it
must
be
hungry
it
has
to
be
fed
anyhow
said
rilla
desperately
tell
me
what
to
get
for
it
susan
and
i
get
it
under
susan
directions
a
ration
of
milk
and
water
was
prepared
and
a
bottle
obtained
from
the
doctor
office
then
rilla
lifted
the
baby
out
of
the
soup
tureen
and
fed
it
she
brought
down
the
old
basket
of
her
own
infancy
from
the
attic
and
laid
the
now
sleeping
baby
in
it
she
put
the
soup
tureen
away
in
the
pantry
then
she
sat
down
to
think
things
over
the
result
of
her
thinking
things
over
was
that
she
went
to
susan
when
the
baby
woke
i
going
to
see
what
i
can
do
susan
i
ca
let
that
poor
little
thing
go
back
to
conover
tell
me
how
to
wash
and
dress
it
under
susan
supervision
rilla
bathed
the
baby
susan
dared
not
help
other
than
by
suggestion
for
the
doctor
was
in
the
and
might
pop
in
at
any
moment
susan
had
learned
by
experience
that
when
blythe
put
his
foot
down
and
said
a
thing
must
be
that
thing
was
rilla
set
her
teeth
and
went
ahead
in
the
name
of
goodness
how
many
wrinkles
and
kinks
did
a
baby
have
why
there
was
enough
of
it
to
take
hold
of
oh
suppose
she
let
it
slip
into
the
water
it
was
so
wobbly
if
it
would
only
stop
howling
like
that
how
could
such
a
tiny
morsel
make
such
an
enormous
noise
its
shrieks
could
be
heard
over
ingleside
from
cellar
to
attic
am
i
really
hurting
it
much
susan
do
you
suppose
she
asked
piteously
no
dearie
most
new
babies
hate
like
poison
to
be
washed
you
are
real
knacky
for
a
beginner
keep
your
hand
under
its
back
whatever
you
do
and
keep
cool
keep
cool
rilla
was
oozing
perspiration
at
every
pore
when
the
baby
was
dried
and
dressed
and
temporarily
quieted
with
another
bottle
she
was
as
limp
as
a
rag
what
must
i
do
with
it
tonight
susan
a
baby
by
day
was
dreadful
enough
a
baby
by
night
was
unthinkable
set
the
basket
on
a
chair
by
your
bed
and
keep
it
covered
you
will
have
to
feed
it
once
or
twice
in
the
night
so
you
would
better
take
the
oil
heater
upstairs
if
you
can
not
manage
it
call
me
and
i
will
go
doctor
or
no
doctor
but
susan
if
it
cries
the
baby
however
did
not
cry
it
was
surprisingly
good
perhaps
because
its
poor
little
stomach
was
filled
with
proper
food
it
slept
most
of
the
night
but
rilla
did
not
she
was
afraid
to
go
to
sleep
for
fear
something
would
happen
to
the
baby
she
prepared
its
three
ration
with
a
grim
determination
that
she
would
not
call
susan
oh
was
she
dreaming
was
it
really
she
rilla
blythe
who
had
got
into
this
absurd
predicament
she
did
not
care
if
the
germans
were
near
paris
she
did
not
care
if
they
were
in
paris
if
only
the
baby
would
cry
or
choke
or
smother
or
have
convulsions
babies
did
have
convulsions
did
they
oh
why
had
she
forgotten
to
ask
susan
what
she
must
do
if
the
baby
had
convulsions
she
reflected
rather
bitterly
that
father
was
very
considerate
of
mother
and
susan
health
but
what
about
hers
did
he
think
she
could
continue
to
exist
if
she
never
got
any
sleep
but
she
was
not
going
to
back
down
now
not
she
she
would
look
after
this
detestable
little
animal
if
it
killed
her
she
would
get
a
book
on
baby
hygiene
and
be
beholden
to
nobody
she
would
never
go
to
father
for
advice
she
would
bother
mother
and
she
would
only
condescend
to
susan
in
dire
extremity
they
would
all
see
thus
it
came
about
that
blythe
when
she
returned
home
two
nights
later
and
asked
susan
where
rilla
was
was
electrified
by
composed
reply
she
upstairs
dear
putting
her
baby
to
bed
chapter
viii
rilla
decides
families
and
individuals
alike
soon
become
used
to
new
conditions
and
accept
them
unquestioningly
by
the
time
a
week
had
elapsed
it
seemed
as
it
the
anderson
baby
had
always
been
at
ingleside
after
the
first
three
distracted
nights
rilla
began
to
sleep
again
waking
automatically
to
attend
to
her
charge
on
schedule
time
she
bathed
and
fed
and
dressed
it
as
skilfully
as
if
she
had
been
doing
it
all
her
life
she
liked
neither
her
job
nor
the
baby
any
the
better
she
still
handled
it
as
gingerly
as
if
it
were
some
kind
of
a
small
lizard
and
a
breakable
lizard
at
that
but
she
did
her
work
thoroughly
and
there
was
not
a
cleaner
infant
in
glen
mary
she
even
took
to
weighing
the
creature
every
day
and
jotting
the
result
down
in
her
diary
but
sometimes
she
asked
herself
pathetically
why
unkind
destiny
had
ever
led
her
down
the
anderson
lane
on
that
fatal
day
shirley
nan
and
di
did
not
tease
her
as
much
as
she
had
expected
they
all
seemed
rather
stunned
by
the
mere
fact
of
rilla
adopting
a
perhaps
too
the
doctor
had
issued
instructions
walter
of
course
never
had
teased
her
over
anything
one
day
he
told
her
she
was
a
brick
it
took
more
courage
for
you
to
tackle
that
five
pounds
of
new
infant
than
it
would
be
for
jem
to
face
a
mile
of
germans
i
wish
i
had
half
your
pluck
he
said
ruefully
rilla
was
very
proud
of
walter
approval
nevertheless
she
wrote
gloomily
in
her
diary
that
night
i
wish
i
could
like
the
baby
a
little
bit
it
would
make
things
easier
but
i
do
i
heard
people
say
that
when
you
took
care
of
a
baby
you
got
fond
of
it
but
you
do
i
do
anyway
and
it
a
nuisance
it
interferes
with
everything
it
just
ties
me
down
and
now
of
all
times
when
i
trying
to
get
the
junior
reds
started
and
i
could
go
to
alice
clow
party
last
night
and
i
was
just
dying
to
of
course
father
is
really
unreasonable
and
i
can
always
get
an
hour
or
two
off
in
the
evening
when
it
necessary
but
i
knew
he
stand
for
my
being
out
half
the
night
and
leaving
susan
or
mother
to
see
to
the
baby
i
suppose
it
was
just
as
well
because
the
thing
did
take
colic
or
something
about
one
it
did
kick
or
stiffen
out
so
i
knew
that
according
to
morgan
it
was
crying
for
temper
and
it
was
hungry
and
no
pins
were
sticking
in
it
it
screamed
till
it
was
black
in
the
face
i
got
up
and
heated
water
and
put
the
bottle
on
its
stomach
and
it
howled
worse
than
ever
and
drew
up
its
poor
wee
thin
legs
i
was
afraid
i
had
burnt
it
but
i
believe
i
did
then
i
walked
the
floor
with
it
although
on
infants
says
that
should
never
be
done
i
walked
miles
and
oh
i
was
so
tired
and
discouraged
and
mad
yes
i
was
i
could
have
shaken
the
creature
if
it
had
been
big
enough
to
shake
but
it
was
father
was
out
on
a
case
and
mother
had
had
a
headache
and
susan
is
squiffy
because
when
she
and
morgan
differ
i
insist
upon
going
by
what
morgan
says
so
i
was
determined
i
would
call
her
unless
i
had
to
finally
miss
oliver
came
in
she
has
rooms
with
nan
now
not
me
all
because
of
the
baby
and
i
am
about
it
i
miss
our
long
talks
after
we
went
to
bed
so
much
it
was
the
only
time
i
ever
had
her
to
myself
i
hated
to
think
the
baby
yells
had
wakened
her
up
for
she
has
so
much
to
bear
now
grant
is
at
valcartier
too
and
miss
oliver
feels
it
dreadfully
though
she
is
splendid
about
it
she
thinks
he
will
never
come
back
and
her
eyes
just
break
my
heart
they
are
so
tragic
she
said
it
was
the
baby
that
woke
her
she
been
able
to
sleep
because
the
germans
are
so
near
paris
she
took
the
little
wretch
and
laid
it
flat
on
its
stomach
across
her
knee
and
thumped
its
back
gently
a
few
times
and
it
stopped
shrieking
and
went
right
off
to
sleep
and
slept
like
a
lamb
the
rest
of
the
night
i
did
i
was
too
worn
out
i
having
a
perfectly
dreadful
time
getting
the
junior
reds
started
i
succeeded
in
getting
betty
mead
as
president
and
i
am
secretary
but
they
put
jen
vickers
in
as
treasurer
and
i
despise
her
she
is
the
sort
of
girl
who
calls
any
clever
handsome
or
distinguished
people
she
knows
slightly
by
their
first
names
behind
their
backs
and
she
is
sly
and
una
does
mind
of
course
she
is
willing
to
do
anything
that
comes
to
hand
and
never
minds
whether
she
has
an
office
or
not
she
is
just
a
perfect
angel
while
i
am
only
angelic
in
spots
and
demonic
in
other
spots
i
wish
walter
would
take
a
fancy
to
her
but
he
never
seems
to
think
about
her
in
that
way
although
i
heard
him
say
once
she
was
like
a
tea
rose
she
is
too
and
she
gets
imposed
upon
just
because
she
is
so
sweet
and
willing
but
i
do
allow
people
to
impose
on
rilla
blythe
and
you
may
tie
to
as
susan
says
just
as
i
expected
olive
was
determined
we
should
have
lunch
served
at
our
meetings
we
had
a
battle
royal
over
it
the
majority
was
against
eats
and
now
the
minority
is
sulking
irene
howard
was
on
the
eats
side
and
she
has
been
very
cool
to
me
ever
since
and
it
makes
me
feel
miserable
i
wonder
if
mother
and
elliott
have
problems
in
the
senior
society
too
i
suppose
they
have
but
they
just
go
on
calmly
in
spite
of
everything
i
go
on
but
not
calmly
i
rage
and
cry
but
i
do
it
all
in
private
and
blow
off
steam
in
this
diary
and
when
over
i
vow
i
show
them
i
never
sulk
i
detest
people
who
sulk
anyhow
we
got
the
society
started
and
we
to
meet
once
a
week
and
we
all
going
to
learn
to
knit
shirley
and
i
went
down
to
the
station
again
to
try
to
induce
dog
monday
to
come
home
but
we
failed
all
the
family
have
tried
and
failed
three
days
after
jem
had
gone
walter
went
down
and
brought
monday
home
by
main
force
in
the
buggy
and
shut
him
up
for
three
days
then
monday
went
on
a
hunger
strike
and
howled
like
a
banshee
night
and
day
we
had
to
let
him
out
or
he
would
have
starved
to
death
so
we
have
decided
to
let
him
alone
and
father
has
arranged
with
the
butcher
near
the
station
to
feed
him
with
bones
and
scraps
besides
one
of
us
goes
down
nearly
every
day
to
take
him
something
he
just
lies
curled
up
in
the
and
every
time
a
train
comes
in
he
will
rush
over
to
the
platform
wagging
his
tail
expectantly
and
tear
around
to
every
one
who
comes
off
the
train
and
then
when
the
train
goes
and
he
realizes
that
jem
has
not
come
he
creeps
dejectedly
back
to
his
shed
with
his
disappointed
eyes
and
lies
down
patiently
to
wait
for
the
next
train
gray
the
station
master
says
there
are
times
when
he
can
hardly
help
crying
from
sheer
sympathy
one
day
some
boys
threw
stones
at
monday
and
old
johnny
mead
who
never
was
known
to
take
notice
of
anything
before
snatched
up
a
meat
axe
in
the
shop
and
chased
them
through
the
village
nobody
has
molested
monday
since
kenneth
ford
has
gone
back
to
toronto
he
came
up
two
evenings
ago
to
say
i
was
home
some
clothes
had
to
be
made
for
the
baby
and
meredith
offered
to
help
me
so
i
was
over
at
the
manse
and
i
did
see
kenneth
not
that
it
matters
he
told
nan
to
say
to
spider
for
him
and
tell
me
not
to
forget
him
wholly
in
my
absorbing
maternal
duties
if
he
could
leave
such
a
frivolous
insulting
message
as
that
for
me
it
shows
plainly
that
our
beautiful
hour
on
the
sandshore
meant
nothing
to
him
and
i
am
not
going
to
think
about
him
or
it
again
fred
arnold
was
at
the
manse
and
walked
home
with
me
he
is
the
new
methodist
minister
son
and
very
nice
and
clever
and
would
be
quite
handsome
if
it
were
not
for
his
nose
it
is
a
really
dreadful
nose
when
he
talks
of
commonplace
things
it
does
not
matter
so
much
but
when
he
talks
of
poetry
and
ideals
the
contrast
between
his
nose
and
his
conversation
is
too
much
for
me
and
i
want
to
shriek
with
laughter
it
is
really
not
fair
because
everything
he
said
was
perfectly
charming
and
if
somebody
like
kenneth
had
said
it
i
would
have
been
enraptured
when
i
listened
to
him
with
my
eyes
cast
down
i
was
quite
fascinated
but
as
soon
as
i
looked
up
and
saw
his
nose
the
spell
was
broken
he
wants
to
enlist
too
but
ca
because
he
is
only
seventeen
elliott
met
us
as
we
were
walking
through
the
village
and
could
not
have
looked
more
horrified
if
she
caught
me
walking
with
the
kaiser
himself
elliott
detests
the
methodists
and
all
their
works
father
says
it
is
an
obsession
with
her
about
september
there
was
an
exodus
from
ingleside
and
the
manse
faith
nan
di
and
walter
left
for
redmond
carl
betook
himself
to
his
harbour
head
school
and
shirley
was
off
to
queen
rilla
was
left
alone
at
ingleside
and
would
have
been
very
lonely
if
she
had
had
time
to
be
she
missed
walter
keenly
since
their
talk
in
rainbow
valley
they
had
grown
very
near
together
and
rilla
discussed
problems
with
walter
which
she
never
mentioned
to
others
but
she
was
so
busy
with
the
junior
reds
and
her
baby
that
there
was
rarely
a
spare
minute
for
loneliness
sometimes
after
she
went
to
bed
she
cried
a
little
in
her
pillow
over
walter
absence
and
jem
at
valcartier
and
unromantic
farewell
message
but
she
was
generally
asleep
before
the
tears
got
fairly
started
shall
i
make
arrangements
to
have
the
baby
sent
to
hopetown
the
doctor
asked
one
day
two
weeks
after
the
baby
arrival
at
ingleside
for
a
moment
rilla
was
tempted
to
say
yes
the
baby
could
be
sent
to
hopetown
it
would
be
decently
looked
after
she
could
have
her
free
days
and
untrammelled
nights
back
again
but
but
that
poor
young
mother
who
had
wanted
it
to
go
to
the
asylum
rilla
could
get
that
out
of
her
thoughts
and
that
very
morning
she
discovered
that
the
baby
had
gained
eight
ounces
since
its
coming
to
ingleside
rilla
had
felt
such
a
thrill
of
pride
over
this
you
you
said
it
might
live
if
it
went
to
hopetown
she
said
it
might
somehow
institutional
care
no
matter
how
good
it
may
be
does
always
succeed
with
delicate
babies
but
you
know
what
it
means
if
you
want
it
kept
here
rilla
i
taken
care
of
it
for
a
fortnight
and
it
has
gained
half
a
pound
cried
rilla
i
think
we
better
wait
until
we
hear
from
its
father
anyhow
he
might
want
to
have
it
sent
to
an
orphan
asylum
when
he
is
fighting
the
battles
of
his
country
the
doctor
and
blythe
exchanged
amused
satisfied
smiles
behind
rilla
back
and
nothing
more
was
said
about
hopetown
then
the
smile
faded
from
the
doctor
face
the
germans
were
twenty
miles
from
paris
horrible
tales
were
beginning
to
appear
in
the
papers
of
deeds
done
in
martyred
belgium
life
was
very
tense
at
ingleside
for
the
older
people
we
eat
up
the
war
news
gertrude
oliver
told
meredith
trying
to
laugh
and
failing
we
study
the
maps
and
nip
the
whole
hun
army
in
a
few
strategic
moves
but
papa
joffre
has
the
benefit
of
our
advice
and
so
paris
must
fall
will
they
reach
it
will
not
some
mighty
hand
yet
intervene
murmured
john
meredith
i
teach
school
like
one
in
a
dream
continued
gertrude
then
i
come
home
and
shut
myself
in
my
room
and
walk
the
floor
i
am
wearing
a
path
right
across
nan
carpet
we
are
so
horribly
near
this
war
them
german
men
are
at
senlis
nothing
nor
nobody
can
save
paris
now
wailed
cousin
sophia
cousin
sophia
had
taken
to
reading
the
newspapers
and
had
learned
more
about
the
geography
of
northern
france
if
not
about
the
pronunciation
of
french
names
in
her
year
than
she
had
ever
known
in
her
schooldays
i
have
not
such
a
poor
opinion
of
the
almighty
or
of
kitchener
said
susan
stubbornly
i
see
there
is
a
bernstoff
man
in
the
states
who
says
that
the
war
is
over
and
germany
has
won
and
they
tell
me
says
the
same
thing
and
is
quite
pleased
about
it
but
i
could
tell
them
both
that
it
is
chancy
work
counting
chickens
even
the
day
before
they
are
hatched
and
bears
have
been
known
to
live
long
after
their
skins
were
sold
why
ai
the
british
navy
doing
more
persisted
cousin
sophia
even
the
british
navy
can
not
sail
on
dry
land
sophia
crawford
i
have
not
given
up
hope
and
i
shall
not
tomascow
and
mobbage
and
all
such
barbarous
names
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
dear
can
you
tell
me
if
is
rimes
or
reems
or
rames
or
rems
i
believe
it
really
more
like
susan
oh
those
french
names
groaned
susan
they
tell
me
the
germans
has
about
ruined
the
church
there
sighed
cousin
sophia
i
always
thought
the
germans
was
christians
a
church
is
bad
enough
but
their
doings
in
belgium
are
far
worse
said
susan
grimly
when
i
heard
the
doctor
reading
about
them
bayonetting
the
babies
dear
i
just
thought
what
if
it
were
our
little
jem
i
was
stirring
the
soup
when
that
thought
came
to
me
and
i
just
felt
that
if
i
could
have
lifted
that
saucepan
full
of
that
boiling
soup
and
thrown
it
at
the
kaiser
i
would
not
have
lived
in
vain
tomorrow
tomorrow
will
bring
the
news
that
the
germans
are
in
paris
said
gertrude
oliver
through
her
tense
lips
she
had
one
of
those
souls
that
are
always
tied
to
the
stake
burning
in
the
suffering
of
the
world
around
them
apart
from
her
own
personal
interest
in
the
war
she
was
racked
by
the
thought
of
paris
falling
into
the
ruthless
hands
of
the
hordes
who
had
burned
louvain
and
ruined
the
wonder
of
rheims
but
on
the
morrow
and
the
next
morrow
came
the
news
of
the
miracle
of
the
marne
rilla
rushed
madly
home
from
the
office
waving
the
enterprise
with
its
big
red
headlines
susan
ran
out
with
trembling
hands
to
hoist
the
flag
the
doctor
stalked
about
muttering
thank
god
blythe
cried
and
laughed
and
cried
again
god
just
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
them
far
no
farther
said
meredith
that
evening
rilla
was
singing
upstairs
as
she
put
the
baby
to
bed
paris
was
saved
the
war
was
over
germany
had
lost
there
would
soon
be
an
end
now
jem
and
jerry
would
be
back
the
black
clouds
had
rolled
by
do
you
dare
have
colic
this
joyful
night
she
told
the
baby
if
you
do
i
clap
you
back
into
your
soup
tureen
and
ship
you
off
to
hopetown
by
freight
on
the
early
train
you
have
got
beautiful
eyes
and
you
not
quite
as
red
and
wrinkled
as
you
were
but
you
have
a
speck
of
hair
and
your
hands
are
like
little
claws
and
i
do
like
you
a
bit
better
than
i
ever
did
but
i
hope
your
poor
little
white
mother
knows
that
you
tucked
in
a
soft
basket
with
a
bottle
of
milk
as
rich
as
morgan
allows
instead
of
perishing
by
inches
with
old
meg
conover
and
i
hope
she
does
know
that
i
nearly
drowned
you
that
first
morning
when
susan
was
there
and
i
let
you
slip
right
out
of
my
hands
into
the
water
why
will
you
be
so
slippery
no
i
do
like
you
and
i
never
will
but
for
all
that
i
going
to
make
a
decent
upstanding
infant
of
you
you
are
going
to
get
as
fat
as
a
child
should
be
for
one
thing
i
am
not
going
to
have
people
saying
a
puny
little
thing
that
baby
of
rilla
blythe
as
old
drew
said
at
the
senior
red
cross
yesterday
if
i
love
you
i
mean
to
be
proud
of
you
at
least
chapter
ix
doc
has
a
misadventure
the
war
will
not
be
over
before
next
spring
now
said
blythe
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
long
battle
of
the
aisne
had
resulted
in
a
stalemate
rilla
was
murmuring
knit
four
purl
one
under
her
breath
and
rocking
the
baby
cradle
with
one
foot
morgan
disapproved
of
cradles
for
babies
but
susan
did
not
and
it
was
worth
while
to
make
some
slight
sacrifice
of
principle
to
keep
susan
in
good
humour
she
laid
down
her
knitting
for
a
moment
and
said
oh
how
can
we
bear
it
so
long
then
picked
up
her
sock
and
went
on
the
rilla
of
two
months
before
would
have
rushed
off
to
rainbow
valley
and
cried
miss
oliver
sighed
and
blythe
clasped
her
hands
for
a
moment
then
susan
said
briskly
well
we
must
just
gird
up
our
loins
and
pitch
in
business
as
usual
is
england
motto
they
tell
me
dear
and
i
have
taken
it
for
mine
not
thinking
i
could
easily
find
a
better
i
shall
make
the
same
kind
of
pudding
today
i
always
make
on
saturday
it
is
a
good
deal
of
trouble
to
make
and
that
is
well
for
it
will
employ
my
thoughts
i
will
remember
that
kitchener
is
at
the
helm
and
joffer
is
doing
very
well
for
a
frenchman
i
shall
get
that
box
of
cake
off
to
little
jem
and
finish
that
pair
of
socks
today
likewise
a
sock
a
day
is
my
allowance
old
albert
mead
of
harbour
head
manages
a
pair
and
a
half
a
day
but
she
has
nothing
to
do
but
knit
you
know
dear
she
has
been
for
years
and
she
has
been
worrying
terrible
because
she
was
no
good
to
anybody
and
a
dreadful
expense
and
yet
could
not
die
and
be
out
of
the
way
and
now
they
tell
me
she
is
quite
chirked
up
and
resigned
to
living
because
there
is
something
she
can
do
and
she
knits
for
the
soldiers
from
daylight
to
dark
even
cousin
sophia
has
taken
to
knitting
dear
and
it
is
a
good
thing
for
she
can
not
think
of
quite
so
many
doleful
speeches
to
make
when
her
hands
are
busy
with
her
needles
instead
of
being
folded
on
her
stomach
she
thinks
we
will
all
be
germans
this
time
next
year
but
i
tell
her
it
will
take
more
than
a
year
to
make
a
german
out
of
me
do
you
know
that
rick
macallister
has
enlisted
dear
and
they
say
joe
milgrave
would
too
only
he
is
afraid
that
if
he
does
that
will
not
let
him
have
miranda
whiskers
says
that
he
will
believe
the
stories
of
german
atrocities
when
he
sees
them
and
that
it
is
a
good
thing
that
rangs
cathedral
has
been
destroyed
because
it
was
a
roman
catholic
church
now
i
am
not
a
roman
catholic
dear
being
born
and
bred
a
good
presbyterian
and
meaning
to
live
and
die
one
but
i
maintain
that
the
catholics
have
as
good
a
right
to
their
churches
as
we
have
to
ours
and
that
the
huns
had
no
kind
of
business
to
destroy
them
just
think
dear
concluded
susan
pathetically
how
we
would
feel
if
a
german
shell
knocked
down
the
spire
of
our
church
here
in
the
glen
and
i
sure
it
is
every
bit
as
bad
to
think
of
rangs
cathedral
being
hammered
to
pieces
and
meanwhile
everywhere
the
lads
of
the
world
rich
and
poor
low
and
high
white
and
brown
were
following
the
piper
call
even
billy
andrews
boy
is
going
and
jane
only
son
and
little
jack
said
blythe
priscilla
son
has
gone
from
japan
and
stella
from
vancouver
and
both
the
rev
jo
boys
philippa
writes
that
her
boys
right
away
not
being
afflicted
with
her
indecision
jem
says
that
he
thinks
they
will
be
leaving
very
soon
now
and
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
get
leave
to
come
so
far
before
they
go
as
they
will
have
to
start
at
a
few
hours
notice
said
the
doctor
passing
the
letter
to
his
wife
that
is
not
fair
said
susan
indignantly
has
sir
sam
hughes
no
regard
for
our
feelings
the
idea
of
whisking
that
blessed
boy
away
to
europe
without
letting
us
even
have
a
last
glimpse
of
him
if
i
were
you
doctor
dear
i
would
write
to
the
papers
about
it
perhaps
it
is
as
well
said
the
disappointed
mother
i
do
believe
i
could
bear
another
parting
from
him
now
that
i
know
the
war
will
not
be
over
as
soon
as
we
hoped
when
he
left
first
oh
if
only
but
no
i
wo
say
it
like
susan
and
rilla
concluded
blythe
achieving
a
laugh
i
am
determined
to
be
a
heroine
you
all
good
stuff
said
the
doctor
i
proud
of
my
women
folk
even
rilla
here
my
of
the
field
is
running
a
red
cross
society
full
blast
and
saving
a
little
life
for
canada
that
a
good
piece
of
work
rilla
daughter
of
anne
what
are
you
going
to
call
your
i
waiting
to
hear
from
jim
anderson
said
rilla
he
may
want
to
name
his
own
child
but
as
the
autumn
weeks
went
by
no
word
came
from
jim
anderson
who
had
never
been
heard
from
since
he
sailed
from
halifax
and
to
whom
the
fate
of
wife
and
child
seemed
a
matter
of
indifference
eventually
rilla
decided
to
call
the
baby
james
and
susan
opined
that
kitchener
should
be
added
thereto
so
james
kitchener
anderson
became
the
possessor
of
a
name
somewhat
more
imposing
than
himself
the
ingleside
family
promptly
shortened
it
to
jims
but
susan
obstinately
called
him
little
kitchener
and
nothing
else
jims
is
no
name
for
a
christian
child
dear
she
said
disapprovingly
cousin
sophia
says
it
is
too
flippant
and
for
once
i
consider
she
utters
sense
though
i
would
not
please
her
by
openly
agreeing
with
her
as
for
the
child
he
is
beginning
to
look
something
like
a
baby
and
i
must
admit
that
rilla
is
wonderful
with
him
though
i
would
not
pamper
pride
by
saying
so
to
her
face
dear
i
shall
never
no
never
forget
the
first
sight
i
had
of
that
infant
lying
in
that
big
soup
tureen
rolled
up
in
dirty
flannel
it
is
not
often
that
susan
baker
is
flabbergasted
but
flabbergasted
i
was
then
and
that
you
may
tie
to
for
one
awful
moment
i
thought
my
mind
had
given
way
and
that
i
was
seeing
visions
then
thinks
i
i
never
heard
of
anyone
having
a
vision
of
a
soup
tureen
so
it
must
be
real
at
least
and
i
plucked
up
confidence
when
i
heard
the
doctor
tell
rilla
that
she
must
take
care
of
the
baby
i
thought
he
was
joking
for
i
did
not
believe
for
a
minute
she
would
or
could
do
it
but
you
see
what
has
happened
and
it
is
making
a
woman
of
her
when
we
have
to
do
a
thing
dear
we
can
do
it
susan
added
another
proof
to
this
concluding
dictum
of
hers
one
day
in
october
the
doctor
and
his
wife
were
away
rilla
was
presiding
over
jims
afternoon
siesta
upstairs
purling
four
and
knitting
one
with
ceaseless
vim
susan
was
seated
on
the
back
veranda
shelling
beans
and
cousin
sophia
was
helping
her
peace
and
tranquility
brooded
over
the
glen
the
sky
was
fleeced
over
with
silvery
shining
clouds
rainbow
valley
lay
in
a
soft
autumnal
haze
of
fairy
purple
the
maple
grove
was
a
burning
bush
of
colour
and
the
hedge
of
around
the
kitchen
yard
was
a
thing
of
wonder
in
its
subtle
tintings
it
did
not
seem
that
strife
could
be
in
the
world
and
susan
faithful
heart
was
lulled
into
a
brief
forgetfulness
although
she
had
lain
awake
most
of
the
preceding
night
thinking
of
little
jem
far
out
on
the
atlantic
where
the
great
fleet
was
carrying
canada
first
army
across
the
ocean
even
cousin
sophia
looked
less
melancholy
than
usual
and
admitted
that
there
was
not
much
fault
to
be
found
in
the
day
although
there
was
no
doubt
it
was
a
and
there
would
be
an
awful
storm
on
its
heels
things
is
too
calm
to
last
she
said
as
if
in
confirmation
of
her
assertion
a
most
unearthly
din
suddenly
arose
behind
them
it
was
quite
impossible
to
describe
the
confused
medley
of
bangs
and
rattles
and
muffled
shrieks
and
yowls
that
proceeded
from
the
kitchen
accompanied
by
occasional
crashes
susan
and
cousin
sophia
stared
at
each
other
in
dismay
what
upon
airth
has
bruk
loose
in
there
gasped
cousin
sophia
it
must
be
that
gone
clean
mad
at
last
muttered
susan
i
have
always
expected
it
rilla
came
flying
out
of
the
side
door
of
the
what
has
happened
she
demanded
it
is
beyond
me
to
say
but
that
possessed
beast
of
yours
is
evidently
at
the
bottom
of
it
said
susan
do
not
go
near
him
at
least
i
will
open
the
door
and
peep
in
there
goes
some
more
of
the
crockery
i
have
always
said
that
the
devil
was
in
him
and
that
i
will
tie
to
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
cat
has
hydrophobia
said
cousin
sophia
solemnly
i
once
heard
of
a
cat
that
went
mad
and
bit
three
people
and
they
all
died
a
most
terrible
death
and
turned
black
as
ink
undismayed
by
this
susan
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
the
floor
was
littered
with
fragments
of
broken
dishes
for
it
seemed
that
the
fatal
tragedy
had
taken
place
on
the
long
dresser
where
susan
array
of
cooking
bowls
had
been
marshalled
in
shining
state
around
the
kitchen
tore
a
frantic
cat
with
his
head
wedged
tightly
in
an
old
salmon
can
blindly
he
careered
about
with
shrieks
and
profanity
commingled
now
banging
the
can
madly
against
anything
he
encountered
now
trying
vainly
to
wrench
it
off
with
his
paws
the
sight
was
so
funny
that
rilla
doubled
up
with
laughter
susan
looked
at
her
reproachfully
i
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
that
beast
has
broken
your
ma
big
blue
that
she
brought
from
green
gables
when
she
was
married
that
is
no
small
calamity
in
my
opinion
but
the
thing
to
consider
now
is
how
to
get
that
can
off
hyde
head
do
you
dast
go
touching
it
exclaimed
cousin
sophia
galvanized
into
animation
it
might
be
your
death
shut
the
kitchen
up
and
send
for
albert
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
sending
for
albert
during
family
difficulties
said
susan
loftily
that
beast
is
in
torment
and
whatever
my
opinion
of
him
may
be
i
can
not
endure
to
see
him
suffering
pain
you
keep
away
rilla
for
little
kitchener
sake
and
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
susan
stalked
undauntedly
into
the
kitchen
seized
an
old
storm
coat
of
the
doctor
and
after
a
wild
pursuit
and
several
fruitless
dashes
and
pounces
managed
to
throw
it
over
the
cat
and
can
then
she
proceeded
to
saw
the
can
loose
with
a
while
rilla
held
the
squirming
animal
rolled
in
the
coat
anything
like
doc
shrieks
while
the
process
was
going
on
was
never
heard
at
ingleside
susan
was
in
mortal
dread
that
the
albert
crawfords
would
hear
it
and
conclude
she
was
torturing
the
creature
to
death
doc
was
a
wrathful
and
indignant
cat
when
he
was
freed
evidently
he
thought
the
whole
thing
was
a
job
to
bring
him
low
he
gave
susan
a
baleful
glance
by
way
of
gratitude
and
rushed
out
of
the
kitchen
to
take
sanctuary
in
the
jungle
of
the
hedge
where
he
sulked
for
the
rest
of
the
day
susan
swept
up
her
broken
dishes
grimly
the
huns
themselves
could
have
worked
more
havoc
here
she
said
bitterly
but
when
people
will
keep
a
satanic
animal
like
that
in
spite
of
all
warnings
they
can
not
complain
when
their
wedding
bowls
get
broken
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
when
an
honest
woman
can
not
leave
her
kitchen
for
a
few
minutes
without
a
fiend
of
a
cat
rampaging
through
it
with
his
head
in
a
salmon
can
chapter
x
the
troubles
of
rilla
october
passed
out
and
the
dreary
days
of
november
and
december
dragged
by
the
world
shook
with
the
thunder
of
contending
armies
antwerp
fell
turkey
declared
war
gallant
little
serbia
gathered
herself
together
and
struck
a
deadly
blow
at
her
oppressor
and
in
quiet
glen
mary
thousands
of
miles
away
hearts
beat
with
hope
and
fear
over
the
varying
dispatches
from
day
to
day
a
few
months
ago
said
miss
oliver
we
thought
and
talked
in
terms
of
glen
mary
now
we
think
and
talk
in
terms
of
military
tactics
and
diplomatic
intrigue
there
was
just
one
great
event
every
day
the
coming
of
the
mail
even
susan
admitted
that
from
the
time
the
buggy
rumbled
over
the
little
bridge
between
the
station
and
the
village
until
the
papers
were
brought
home
and
read
she
could
not
work
properly
i
must
take
up
my
knitting
then
and
knit
hard
till
the
papers
come
dear
knitting
is
something
you
can
do
even
when
your
heart
is
going
like
a
and
the
pit
of
your
stomach
feels
all
gone
and
your
thoughts
are
catawampus
then
when
i
see
the
headlines
be
they
good
or
be
they
bad
i
calm
down
and
am
able
to
go
about
my
business
again
it
is
an
unfortunate
thing
that
the
mail
comes
in
just
when
our
dinner
rush
is
on
and
i
think
the
government
could
arrange
things
better
but
the
drive
on
calais
has
failed
as
i
felt
perfectly
sure
it
would
and
the
kaiser
will
not
eat
his
christmas
dinner
in
london
this
year
do
you
know
dear
susan
voice
lowered
as
a
token
that
she
was
going
to
impart
a
very
shocking
piece
of
information
i
have
been
told
on
good
authority
or
else
you
may
be
sure
i
would
not
be
repeating
it
when
it
concerns
a
minster
that
the
rev
arnold
goes
to
charlottetown
every
week
and
takes
a
turkish
bath
for
his
rheumatism
the
idea
of
him
doing
that
when
we
are
at
war
with
turkey
one
of
his
own
deacons
has
always
insisted
that
arnold
theology
was
not
sound
and
i
am
beginning
to
believe
that
there
is
some
reason
to
fear
it
well
i
must
bestir
myself
this
afternoon
and
get
little
jem
christmas
cake
packed
up
for
him
he
will
enjoy
it
if
the
blessed
boy
is
not
drowned
in
mud
before
that
time
jem
was
in
camp
on
salisbury
plain
and
was
writing
gay
cheery
letters
home
in
spite
of
the
mud
walter
was
at
redmond
and
his
letters
to
rilla
were
anything
but
cheerful
she
never
opened
one
without
a
dread
tugging
at
her
heart
that
it
would
tell
her
he
had
enlisted
his
unhappiness
made
her
unhappy
she
wanted
to
put
her
arm
round
him
and
comfort
him
as
she
had
done
that
day
in
rainbow
valley
she
hated
everybody
who
was
responsible
for
walter
unhappiness
he
will
go
yet
she
murmured
miserably
to
herself
one
afternoon
as
she
sat
alone
in
rainbow
valley
reading
a
letter
from
him
he
will
go
yet
and
if
he
does
i
just
ca
bear
it
walter
wrote
that
some
one
had
sent
him
an
envelope
containing
a
white
feather
i
deserved
it
rilla
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
put
it
on
and
wear
it
proclaiming
myself
to
all
redmond
the
coward
i
know
i
am
the
boys
of
my
year
are
going
going
every
day
two
or
three
of
them
join
up
some
days
i
almost
make
up
my
mind
to
do
it
and
then
i
see
myself
thrusting
a
bayonet
through
another
man
some
woman
husband
or
sweetheart
or
son
perhaps
the
father
of
little
children
i
see
myself
lying
alone
torn
and
mangled
burning
with
thirst
on
a
cold
wet
field
surrounded
by
dead
and
dying
men
and
i
know
i
never
can
i
ca
face
even
the
thought
of
it
how
could
i
face
the
reality
there
are
times
when
i
wish
i
had
never
been
born
life
has
always
seemed
such
a
beautiful
thing
to
me
and
now
it
is
a
hideous
thing
if
it
were
for
your
letters
your
dear
bright
merry
funny
comical
believing
letters
i
think
i
give
up
and
una
una
is
really
a
little
brick
is
she
there
a
wonderful
fineness
and
firmness
under
all
that
shy
wistful
girlishness
of
her
she
your
knack
of
writing
epistles
but
there
something
in
her
letters
i
do
know
what
that
makes
me
feel
at
least
while
i
reading
them
that
i
could
even
go
to
the
front
not
that
she
ever
says
a
word
about
my
going
or
hints
that
i
ought
to
go
she
is
that
kind
it
just
the
spirit
of
them
the
personality
that
is
in
them
well
i
ca
go
you
have
a
brother
and
una
has
a
friend
who
is
a
coward
oh
i
wish
walter
would
write
such
things
sighed
rilla
it
hurts
me
he
is
a
coward
he
is
he
is
she
looked
wistfully
about
her
at
the
little
woodland
valley
and
the
grey
lonely
fallows
beyond
how
everything
reminded
her
of
walter
the
red
leaves
still
clung
to
the
wild
that
overhung
a
curve
of
the
brook
their
stems
were
gemmed
with
the
pearls
of
the
gentle
rain
that
had
fallen
a
little
while
before
walter
had
once
written
a
poem
describing
them
the
wind
was
sighing
and
rustling
among
the
frosted
brown
bracken
ferns
then
lessening
sorrowfully
away
down
the
brook
walter
had
said
once
that
he
loved
the
melancholy
of
the
autumn
wind
on
a
november
day
the
old
tree
lovers
still
clasped
each
other
in
a
faithful
embrace
and
the
white
lady
now
a
great
tree
stood
out
beautifully
fine
against
the
grey
velvet
sky
walter
had
named
them
long
ago
and
last
november
when
he
had
walked
with
her
and
miss
oliver
in
the
valley
he
had
said
looking
at
the
leafless
lady
with
a
young
silver
moon
hanging
over
her
a
white
birch
is
a
beautiful
pagan
maiden
who
has
never
lost
the
eden
secret
of
being
naked
and
unashamed
miss
oliver
had
said
put
that
into
a
poem
walter
and
he
had
done
so
and
read
it
to
them
the
next
day
just
a
short
thing
with
goblin
imagination
in
every
line
of
it
oh
how
happy
they
had
been
then
well
rilla
scrambled
to
her
feet
time
was
up
jims
would
soon
be
awake
his
lunch
had
to
be
prepared
his
little
slips
had
to
be
ironed
there
was
a
committee
meeting
of
the
junior
reds
that
night
there
was
her
new
knitting
bag
to
finish
it
would
be
the
handsomest
bag
in
the
junior
society
handsomer
even
than
irene
howard
she
must
get
home
and
get
to
work
she
was
busy
these
days
from
morning
till
night
that
little
monkey
of
a
jims
took
so
much
time
but
he
was
growing
he
was
certainly
growing
and
there
were
times
when
rilla
felt
sure
that
it
was
not
merely
a
pious
hope
but
an
absolute
fact
that
he
was
getting
decidedly
better
looking
sometimes
she
felt
quite
proud
of
him
and
sometimes
she
yearned
to
spank
him
but
she
never
kissed
him
or
wanted
to
kiss
him
the
germans
captured
lodz
today
said
miss
oliver
one
december
evening
when
she
blythe
and
susan
were
busy
sewing
or
knitting
in
the
cosy
this
war
is
at
least
extending
my
knowledge
of
geography
though
i
am
three
months
ago
i
did
know
there
was
such
a
place
in
the
world
such
as
lodz
had
i
heard
it
mentioned
i
would
have
known
nothing
about
it
and
cared
as
little
i
know
all
about
it
now
its
size
its
standing
its
military
significance
yesterday
the
news
that
the
germans
have
captured
it
in
their
second
rush
to
warsaw
made
my
heart
sink
into
my
boots
i
woke
up
in
the
night
and
worried
over
it
i
do
wonder
babies
always
cry
when
they
wake
up
in
the
night
everything
presses
on
my
soul
then
and
no
cloud
has
a
silver
lining
when
i
wake
up
in
the
night
and
can
not
go
to
sleep
again
remarked
susan
who
was
knitting
and
reading
at
the
same
time
i
pass
the
moments
by
torturing
the
kaiser
to
death
last
night
i
fried
him
in
boiling
oil
and
a
great
comfort
it
was
to
me
remembering
those
belgian
babies
if
the
kaiser
were
here
and
had
a
pain
in
his
shoulder
you
be
the
first
to
run
for
the
liniment
bottle
to
rub
him
down
laughed
miss
oliver
would
i
cried
outraged
susan
would
i
miss
oliver
i
would
rub
him
down
with
coal
oil
miss
oliver
and
leave
it
to
blister
that
is
what
i
would
do
and
that
you
may
tie
to
a
pain
in
his
shoulder
indeed
he
will
have
pains
all
over
him
before
he
is
through
with
what
he
has
started
we
are
told
to
love
our
enemies
susan
said
the
doctor
solemnly
yes
our
enemies
but
not
king
george
enemies
doctor
dear
retorted
susan
crushingly
she
was
so
well
pleased
with
herself
over
this
flattening
out
of
the
doctor
completely
that
she
even
smiled
as
she
polished
her
glasses
susan
had
never
given
in
to
glasses
before
but
she
had
done
so
at
last
in
order
to
be
able
to
read
the
war
news
and
not
a
dispatch
got
by
her
can
you
tell
me
miss
oliver
how
to
pronounce
and
and
that
last
is
a
conundrum
which
nobody
seems
to
have
solved
yet
susan
and
i
can
make
only
a
guess
at
the
others
these
foreign
names
are
far
from
being
decent
in
my
opinion
said
disgusted
susan
i
dare
say
the
austrians
and
russians
would
think
saskatchewan
and
musquodoboit
about
as
bad
susan
said
miss
oliver
the
serbians
have
done
wonderfully
of
late
they
have
captured
belgrade
and
sent
the
austrian
creatures
packing
across
the
danube
with
a
flea
in
their
ear
said
susan
with
a
relish
as
she
settled
down
to
examine
a
map
of
eastern
europe
prodding
each
locality
with
the
knitting
needle
to
brand
it
on
her
memory
cousin
sophia
said
awhile
ago
that
serbia
was
done
for
but
i
told
her
there
was
still
such
a
thing
as
an
providence
doubt
it
who
might
it
says
here
that
the
slaughter
was
terrible
for
all
they
were
foreigners
it
is
awful
to
think
of
so
many
men
being
killed
dear
for
they
are
scarce
enough
as
it
is
rilla
was
upstairs
relieving
her
feelings
by
writing
in
her
diary
things
have
all
catawampus
as
susan
says
with
me
this
week
part
of
it
was
my
own
fault
and
part
of
it
was
and
i
seem
to
be
equally
unhappy
over
both
parts
i
went
to
town
the
other
day
to
buy
a
new
winter
hat
it
was
the
first
time
nobody
insisted
on
coming
with
me
to
help
me
select
it
and
i
felt
that
mother
had
really
given
up
thinking
of
me
as
a
child
and
i
found
the
dearest
hat
it
was
simply
bewitching
it
was
a
velvet
hat
of
the
very
shade
of
rich
green
that
was
made
for
me
it
just
goes
with
my
hair
and
complexion
beautifully
bringing
out
the
shades
and
what
miss
oliver
calls
my
so
well
only
once
before
in
my
life
have
i
come
across
that
precise
shade
of
green
when
i
was
twelve
i
had
a
little
beaver
hat
of
it
and
all
the
girls
in
school
were
wild
over
it
well
as
soon
as
i
saw
this
hat
i
felt
that
i
simply
must
have
it
and
have
it
i
did
the
price
was
dreadful
i
will
not
put
it
down
here
because
i
do
want
my
descendants
to
know
i
was
guilty
of
paying
so
much
for
a
hat
in
too
when
everybody
is
or
should
be
trying
to
be
economical
when
i
got
home
and
tried
on
the
hat
again
in
my
room
i
was
assailed
by
qualms
of
course
it
was
very
becoming
but
somehow
it
seemed
too
elaborate
and
fussy
for
church
going
and
our
quiet
little
doings
in
the
glen
too
conspicuous
in
short
it
had
seemed
so
at
the
but
here
in
my
little
white
room
it
did
and
that
dreadful
price
tag
and
the
starving
belgians
when
mother
saw
the
hat
and
the
tag
she
just
looked
at
me
mother
is
some
expert
at
looking
father
says
she
looked
him
into
love
with
her
years
ago
in
avonlea
school
and
i
can
well
believe
it
though
i
have
heard
a
weird
tale
of
her
banging
him
over
the
head
with
a
slate
at
the
very
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
mother
was
a
limb
when
she
was
a
little
girl
i
understand
and
even
up
to
the
time
when
jem
went
away
she
was
full
of
ginger
but
let
me
return
to
my
mutton
that
is
to
say
my
new
green
velvet
hat
you
think
rilla
mother
said
quietly
far
too
quietly
it
was
right
to
spend
so
much
for
a
hat
especially
when
the
need
of
the
world
is
so
great
paid
for
it
out
of
my
own
allowance
mother
i
exclaimed
is
not
the
point
your
allowance
is
based
on
the
principle
of
a
reasonable
amount
for
each
thing
you
need
if
you
pay
too
much
for
one
thing
you
must
cut
off
somewhere
else
and
that
is
not
satisfactory
but
if
you
think
you
did
right
rilla
i
have
no
more
to
say
i
leave
it
to
your
conscience
i
wish
mother
would
not
leave
things
to
my
conscience
and
anyway
what
was
i
to
do
i
could
take
that
hat
back
i
had
worn
it
to
a
concert
in
town
i
had
to
keep
it
i
was
so
uncomfortable
that
i
flew
into
a
temper
a
cold
calm
deadly
temper
i
said
haughtily
am
sorry
you
disapprove
of
my
hat
of
the
hat
exactly
said
mother
i
consider
it
in
doubtful
taste
for
so
young
a
girl
but
of
the
price
you
paid
for
it
being
interrupted
did
improve
my
temper
so
i
went
on
colder
and
calmer
and
deadlier
than
ever
just
as
if
mother
had
not
but
i
have
to
keep
it
now
however
i
promise
you
that
i
will
not
get
another
hat
for
three
years
or
for
the
duration
of
the
war
if
it
lasts
longer
than
that
even
you
oh
the
sarcasm
i
put
into
the
can
not
say
that
what
i
paid
was
too
much
when
spread
over
at
least
three
years
will
be
very
tired
of
that
hat
before
three
years
rilla
said
mother
with
a
provoking
grin
which
being
interpreted
meant
that
i
would
stick
it
out
or
not
i
will
wear
it
that
long
i
said
and
then
i
marched
upstairs
and
cried
to
think
that
i
had
been
sarcastic
to
mother
i
hate
that
hat
already
but
three
years
or
the
duration
of
the
war
i
said
and
three
years
or
the
duration
of
the
war
it
shall
be
i
vowed
and
i
shall
keep
my
vow
cost
what
it
will
that
is
one
of
the
things
the
other
is
that
i
have
quarrelled
with
irene
howard
or
she
quarrelled
with
me
or
no
we
both
quarrelled
the
junior
red
cross
met
here
yesterday
the
hour
of
meeting
was
two
but
irene
came
at
one
because
she
got
the
chance
of
a
drive
down
from
the
upper
glen
irene
has
been
a
bit
nice
to
me
since
the
fuss
about
the
eats
and
besides
i
feel
sure
she
resents
not
being
president
but
i
have
been
determined
that
things
should
go
smoothly
so
i
have
never
taken
any
notice
and
when
she
came
yesterday
she
seemed
so
nice
and
sweet
again
that
i
hoped
she
had
got
over
her
huffiness
and
we
could
be
the
chums
we
used
to
be
but
as
soon
as
we
sat
down
irene
began
to
rub
me
the
wrong
way
i
saw
her
cast
a
look
at
my
new
all
the
girls
have
always
said
irene
was
and
i
would
never
believe
them
before
but
now
i
feel
that
perhaps
she
is
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
pounce
on
jims
irene
pretends
to
adore
babies
pick
him
out
of
his
cradle
and
kiss
him
all
over
his
face
now
irene
knows
perfectly
well
that
i
do
like
to
have
jims
kissed
like
that
it
is
not
hygienic
after
she
had
worried
him
till
he
began
to
fuss
she
looked
at
me
and
gave
quite
a
nasty
little
laugh
but
she
said
oh
so
sweetly
rilla
darling
you
look
as
if
you
thought
i
was
poisoning
the
baby
no
i
do
irene
i
said
every
bit
as
sweetly
you
know
morgan
says
that
the
only
place
a
baby
should
be
kissed
is
on
its
forehead
for
fear
of
germs
and
that
is
my
rule
with
jims
me
am
i
so
full
of
germs
said
irene
plaintively
i
knew
she
was
making
fun
of
me
and
i
began
to
boil
inside
but
outside
no
sign
of
a
simmer
i
was
determined
i
would
not
scrap
with
irene
then
she
began
to
bounce
jims
now
morgan
says
bouncing
is
almost
the
worst
thing
that
can
be
done
to
a
baby
i
never
allow
jims
to
be
bounced
but
irene
bounced
him
and
that
exasperating
child
liked
it
he
smiled
for
the
very
first
time
he
is
four
months
old
and
he
has
never
smiled
once
before
not
even
mother
or
susan
have
been
able
to
coax
that
thing
to
smile
try
as
they
would
and
here
he
was
smiling
because
irene
howard
bounced
him
talk
of
gratitude
i
admit
that
smile
made
a
big
difference
in
him
two
of
the
dearest
dimples
came
out
in
his
cheeks
and
his
big
brown
eyes
seemed
full
of
laughter
the
way
irene
raved
over
those
dimples
was
silly
i
consider
you
would
have
supposed
she
thought
she
had
really
brought
them
into
existence
but
i
sewed
steadily
and
did
not
enthuse
and
soon
irene
got
tired
of
bouncing
jims
and
put
him
back
in
his
cradle
he
did
not
like
that
after
being
played
with
and
he
began
to
cry
and
was
fussy
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
whereas
if
irene
had
only
left
him
alone
he
would
not
have
been
a
bit
of
trouble
irene
looked
at
him
and
said
he
often
cry
like
that
as
if
she
had
never
heard
a
baby
crying
before
i
explained
patiently
that
children
have
to
cry
so
many
minutes
per
day
in
order
to
expand
their
lungs
morgan
says
so
jims
did
cry
at
all
i
have
to
make
him
cry
for
at
least
twenty
minutes
i
said
indeed
said
irene
laughing
as
if
she
did
believe
me
on
the
care
of
infants
was
upstairs
or
i
would
soon
have
convinced
her
then
she
said
jims
did
have
much
hair
she
had
never
seen
a
four
months
old
baby
so
bald
of
course
i
knew
jims
had
much
hair
yet
but
irene
said
it
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
imply
it
was
my
fault
that
he
had
any
hair
i
said
i
had
seen
dozens
of
babies
every
bit
as
bald
as
jims
and
irene
said
oh
very
well
she
had
meant
to
offend
me
when
i
offended
it
went
on
like
that
the
rest
of
the
hour
irene
kept
giving
me
little
digs
all
the
time
the
girls
have
always
said
she
was
revengeful
like
that
if
she
were
peeved
about
anything
but
i
never
believed
it
before
i
used
to
think
irene
just
perfect
and
it
hurt
me
dreadfully
to
find
she
could
stoop
to
this
but
i
corked
up
my
feelings
and
sewed
away
for
dear
life
on
a
belgian
child
nightgown
then
irene
told
me
the
meanest
most
contemptible
thing
that
someone
had
said
about
walter
i
wo
write
it
down
i
ca
of
course
she
said
it
made
her
furious
to
hear
it
and
all
that
but
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
tell
me
such
a
thing
even
if
she
did
hear
it
she
simply
did
it
to
hurt
me
i
just
exploded
dare
you
come
here
and
repeat
such
a
thing
about
my
brother
irene
howard
i
exclaimed
shall
never
forgive
you
never
your
brother
has
enlisted
has
any
idea
of
enlisting
rilla
dear
i
did
say
it
said
irene
told
you
it
was
george
burr
and
i
told
her
do
want
to
hear
what
you
told
her
do
you
ever
speak
to
me
again
irene
howard
oh
course
i
should
have
said
that
but
it
just
seemed
to
say
itself
then
the
other
girls
all
came
in
a
bunch
and
i
had
to
calm
down
and
act
the
hostess
part
as
well
as
i
could
irene
paired
off
with
olive
kirk
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
and
went
away
without
so
much
as
a
look
so
i
suppose
she
means
to
take
me
at
my
word
and
i
care
for
i
do
not
want
to
be
friends
with
a
girl
who
could
repeat
such
a
falsehood
about
walter
but
i
feel
unhappy
over
it
for
all
that
we
always
been
such
good
chums
and
until
lately
irene
was
lovely
to
me
and
now
another
illusion
has
been
stripped
from
my
eyes
and
i
feel
as
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
real
true
friendship
in
the
world
father
got
old
joe
mead
to
build
a
kennel
for
dog
monday
in
the
corner
of
the
today
we
thought
perhaps
monday
would
come
home
when
the
cold
weather
came
but
he
would
no
earthly
influence
can
coax
monday
away
from
that
shed
even
for
a
few
minutes
there
he
stays
and
meets
every
train
so
we
had
to
do
something
to
make
him
comfortable
joe
built
the
kennel
so
that
monday
could
lie
in
it
and
still
see
the
platform
so
we
hope
he
will
occupy
it
monday
has
become
quite
famous
a
reporter
of
the
enterprise
came
out
from
town
and
photographed
him
and
wrote
up
the
whole
story
of
his
faithful
vigil
it
was
published
in
the
enterprise
and
copied
all
over
canada
but
that
does
matter
to
poor
little
monday
jem
has
gone
away
monday
does
know
where
or
why
but
he
will
wait
until
he
comes
back
somehow
it
comforts
me
it
foolish
i
suppose
but
it
gives
me
a
feeling
that
jem
will
come
back
or
else
monday
would
keep
on
waiting
for
him
jims
is
snoring
beside
me
in
his
cradle
it
is
just
a
cold
that
makes
him
snore
not
adenoids
irene
had
a
cold
yesterday
and
i
know
she
gave
it
to
him
kissing
him
he
is
not
quite
such
a
nuisance
as
he
was
he
has
got
some
backbone
and
can
sit
up
quite
nicely
and
he
loves
his
bath
now
and
splashes
unsmilingly
in
the
water
instead
of
twisting
and
shrieking
oh
shall
i
ever
forget
those
first
two
months
i
do
know
how
i
lived
through
them
but
here
i
am
and
here
is
jims
and
we
both
are
going
to
on
i
tickled
him
a
little
bit
tonight
when
i
undressed
him
i
would
bounce
him
but
morgan
does
mention
tickling
just
to
see
if
he
would
smile
for
me
as
well
as
irene
and
he
did
and
out
popped
the
dimples
what
a
pity
his
mother
could
have
seen
them
i
finished
my
sixth
pair
of
socks
today
with
the
first
three
i
got
susan
to
set
the
heel
for
me
then
i
thought
that
was
a
bit
of
shirking
so
i
learned
to
do
it
myself
i
hate
it
but
i
have
done
so
many
things
i
hate
since
of
august
that
one
more
or
less
matter
i
just
think
of
jem
joking
about
the
mud
on
salisbury
plain
and
i
go
at
them
chapter
xi
dark
and
bright
at
christmas
the
college
boys
and
girls
came
home
and
for
a
little
while
ingleside
was
gay
again
but
all
were
not
there
for
the
first
time
one
was
missing
from
the
circle
round
the
christmas
table
jem
of
the
steady
lips
and
fearless
eyes
was
far
away
and
rilla
felt
that
the
sight
of
his
vacant
chair
was
more
than
she
could
endure
susan
had
taken
a
stubborn
freak
and
insisted
on
setting
out
jem
place
for
him
as
usual
with
the
twisted
little
napkin
ring
he
had
always
had
since
a
boy
and
the
odd
high
green
gables
goblet
that
aunt
marilla
had
once
given
him
and
from
which
he
always
insisted
on
drinking
that
blessed
boy
shall
have
his
place
dear
said
susan
firmly
and
do
not
you
feel
over
it
for
you
may
be
sure
he
is
here
in
spirit
and
next
christmas
he
will
be
here
in
the
body
wait
you
till
the
big
push
comes
in
the
spring
and
the
war
will
be
over
in
a
jiffy
they
tried
to
think
so
but
a
shadow
stalked
in
the
background
of
their
determined
merrymaking
walter
too
was
quiet
and
dull
all
through
the
holidays
he
showed
rilla
a
cruel
anonymous
letter
he
had
received
at
redmond
a
letter
far
more
conspicuous
for
malice
than
for
patriotic
indignation
nevertheless
all
it
says
is
true
rilla
rilla
had
caught
it
from
him
and
thrown
it
into
the
fire
there
is
one
word
of
truth
in
it
she
declared
hotly
walter
you
got
morbid
as
miss
oliver
says
she
gets
when
she
broods
too
long
over
one
thing
i
ca
get
away
from
it
at
redmond
rilla
the
whole
college
is
aflame
over
the
war
a
perfectly
fit
fellow
of
military
age
who
does
join
up
is
looked
upon
as
a
shirker
and
treated
accordingly
milne
the
english
professor
who
has
always
made
a
special
pet
of
me
has
two
sons
in
khaki
and
i
can
feel
the
change
in
his
manner
towards
me
it
not
fair
you
not
fit
physically
i
am
sound
as
a
bell
the
unfitness
is
in
the
soul
and
it
a
taint
and
a
disgrace
there
do
cry
rilla
i
not
going
if
that
what
you
afraid
of
the
piper
music
rings
in
my
ears
day
and
night
but
i
can
not
follow
you
would
break
mother
heart
and
mine
if
you
did
sobbed
rilla
oh
walter
one
is
enough
for
any
family
the
holidays
were
an
unhappy
time
for
her
still
having
nan
and
di
and
walter
and
shirley
home
helped
in
the
enduring
of
things
a
letter
and
book
came
for
her
from
kenneth
ford
too
some
sentences
in
the
letter
made
her
cheeks
burn
and
her
heart
beat
until
the
last
paragraph
which
sent
an
icy
chill
over
everything
my
ankle
is
about
as
good
as
new
i
be
fit
to
join
up
in
a
couple
of
months
more
it
will
be
some
feeling
to
get
into
khaki
all
right
little
ken
will
be
able
to
look
the
whole
world
in
the
face
then
and
owe
not
any
man
it
been
rotten
lately
since
i
been
able
to
walk
without
limping
people
who
do
know
look
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
well
they
wo
have
the
chance
to
look
it
much
longer
i
hate
this
war
said
rilla
bitterly
as
she
gazed
out
into
the
maple
grove
that
was
a
chill
glory
of
pink
and
gold
in
the
winter
sunset
has
gone
said
blythe
on
new
year
day
its
sun
which
rose
fairly
has
set
in
blood
what
will
bring
victory
said
susan
for
once
laconic
do
you
really
believe
we
win
the
war
susan
said
miss
oliver
drearily
she
had
come
over
from
lowbridge
to
spend
the
day
and
see
walter
and
the
girls
before
they
went
back
to
redmond
she
was
in
a
rather
blue
and
cynical
mood
and
inclined
to
look
on
the
dark
side
we
win
the
war
exclaimed
susan
no
miss
oliver
dear
i
do
not
believe
i
know
that
does
not
worry
me
what
does
worry
me
is
the
trouble
and
expense
of
it
all
but
then
you
can
not
make
omelets
without
breaking
eggs
so
we
must
just
trust
in
god
and
make
big
guns
sometimes
i
think
the
big
guns
are
better
to
trust
in
than
god
said
miss
oliver
defiantly
no
no
dear
you
do
not
the
germans
had
the
big
guns
at
the
marne
had
they
not
but
providence
settled
them
do
not
ever
forget
that
just
hold
on
to
that
when
you
feel
inclined
to
doubt
clutch
hold
of
the
sides
of
your
chair
and
sit
tight
and
keep
saying
guns
are
good
but
the
almighty
is
better
and
he
is
on
our
side
no
matter
what
the
kaiser
says
about
it
i
would
have
gone
crazy
many
a
day
lately
miss
oliver
dear
if
i
had
not
sat
tight
and
repeated
that
to
myself
my
cousin
sophia
is
like
you
somewhat
inclined
to
despond
dear
me
what
will
we
do
if
the
germans
ever
get
here
she
wailed
to
me
yesterday
them
said
i
just
as
as
that
is
plenty
of
room
for
the
graves
cousin
sophia
said
that
i
was
flippant
but
i
was
not
flippant
miss
oliver
dear
only
calm
and
confident
in
the
british
navy
and
our
canadian
boys
i
am
like
old
william
pollock
of
the
harbour
head
he
is
very
old
and
has
been
ill
for
a
long
time
and
one
night
last
week
he
was
so
low
that
his
whispered
to
some
one
that
she
thought
he
was
dead
it
i
ai
he
called
right
out
only
miss
oliver
dear
he
did
not
use
so
mild
a
word
as
it
i
ai
and
i
do
mean
to
die
until
the
kaiser
is
well
licked
now
that
miss
oliver
dear
concluded
susan
is
the
kind
of
spirit
i
admire
i
admire
it
but
i
ca
emulate
it
sighed
gertrude
before
this
i
have
always
been
able
to
escape
from
the
hard
things
of
life
for
a
little
while
by
going
into
dreamland
and
coming
back
like
a
giant
refreshed
but
i
ca
escape
from
this
nor
i
said
blythe
i
hate
going
to
bed
now
all
my
life
liked
going
to
bed
to
have
a
gay
mad
splendid
of
imagining
things
before
sleeping
now
i
imagine
them
still
but
such
different
things
i
am
rather
glad
when
the
time
comes
to
go
to
bed
said
miss
oliver
i
like
the
darkness
because
i
can
be
myself
in
it
i
need
smile
or
talk
bravely
but
sometimes
my
imagination
gets
out
of
hand
too
and
i
see
what
you
do
terrible
things
terrible
years
to
come
i
am
very
thankful
that
i
never
had
any
imagination
to
speak
of
said
susan
i
have
been
spared
that
i
see
by
this
paper
that
the
crown
prince
is
killed
again
do
you
suppose
there
is
any
hope
of
his
staying
dead
this
time
and
i
also
see
that
woodrow
wilson
is
going
to
write
another
note
i
wonder
concluded
susan
with
the
bitter
irony
she
had
of
late
begun
to
use
when
referring
to
the
poor
president
if
that
man
schoolmaster
is
alive
in
january
jims
was
five
months
old
and
rilla
celebrated
the
anniversary
by
shortening
him
he
weighs
fourteen
pounds
she
announced
jubilantly
just
exactly
what
he
should
weigh
at
five
months
according
to
morgan
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
in
anybody
mind
that
jims
was
getting
positively
pretty
his
little
cheeks
were
round
and
firm
and
faintly
pink
his
eyes
were
big
and
bright
his
tiny
paws
had
dimples
at
the
root
of
every
finger
he
had
even
begun
to
grow
hair
much
to
unspoken
relief
there
was
a
pale
golden
fuzz
all
over
his
head
that
was
distinctly
visible
in
some
lights
he
was
a
good
infant
generally
sleeping
and
digesting
as
morgan
decreed
occasionally
he
smiled
but
he
had
never
laughed
in
spite
of
all
efforts
to
make
him
this
worried
rilla
also
because
morgan
said
that
babies
usually
laughed
aloud
from
the
third
to
the
fifth
month
jims
was
five
months
and
had
no
notion
of
laughing
why
had
he
was
he
normal
one
night
rilla
came
home
late
from
a
recruiting
meeting
at
the
glen
where
she
had
been
giving
patriotic
recitations
rilla
had
never
been
willing
to
recite
in
public
before
she
was
afraid
of
her
tendency
to
lisp
which
had
a
habit
of
reviving
if
she
were
doing
anything
that
made
her
nervous
when
she
had
first
been
asked
to
recite
at
the
upper
glen
meeting
she
had
refused
then
she
began
to
worry
over
her
refusal
was
it
cowardly
what
would
jem
think
if
he
knew
after
two
days
of
worry
rilla
phoned
to
the
president
of
the
patriotic
society
that
she
would
recite
she
did
and
lisped
several
times
and
lay
awake
most
of
the
night
in
an
agony
of
wounded
vanity
then
two
nights
after
she
recited
again
at
harbour
head
she
had
been
at
lowbridge
and
since
then
and
had
become
resigned
to
an
occasional
lisp
nobody
except
herself
seemed
to
mind
it
and
she
was
so
earnest
and
appealing
and
more
than
one
recruit
joined
up
because
rilla
eyes
seemed
to
look
right
at
him
when
she
passionately
demanded
how
could
men
die
better
than
fighting
for
the
ashes
of
their
fathers
and
the
temples
of
their
gods
or
assured
her
audience
with
thrilling
intensity
that
one
crowded
hour
of
glorious
life
was
worth
an
age
without
a
name
even
stolid
miller
douglas
was
so
fired
one
night
that
it
took
mary
vance
a
good
hour
to
talk
him
back
to
sense
mary
vance
said
bitterly
that
if
rilla
blythe
felt
as
bad
as
she
had
pretended
to
feel
over
jem
going
to
the
front
she
would
be
urging
other
brothers
and
friends
to
go
on
this
particular
night
rilla
was
tired
and
cold
and
very
thankful
to
creep
into
her
warm
nest
and
cuddle
down
between
her
blankets
though
as
usual
with
a
sorrowful
wonder
how
jem
and
jerry
were
faring
she
was
just
getting
warm
and
drowsy
when
jims
suddenly
began
to
cry
and
kept
on
crying
rilla
curled
herself
up
in
her
bed
and
determined
she
would
let
him
cry
she
had
morgan
behind
her
for
justification
jims
was
warm
physically
comfortable
his
cry
was
the
cry
of
pain
and
had
his
little
tummy
as
full
as
was
good
for
him
under
such
circumstances
it
would
be
simply
spoiling
him
to
fuss
over
him
and
she
was
going
to
do
it
he
could
cry
until
he
got
good
and
tired
and
ready
to
go
to
sleep
again
then
rilla
imagination
began
to
torment
her
suppose
she
thought
i
was
a
tiny
helpless
creature
only
five
months
old
with
my
father
somewhere
in
france
and
my
poor
little
mother
who
had
been
so
worried
about
me
in
the
graveyard
suppose
i
was
lying
in
a
basket
in
a
big
black
room
without
one
speck
of
light
and
nobody
within
miles
of
me
for
all
i
could
see
or
know
suppose
there
was
a
human
being
anywhere
who
loved
me
for
a
father
who
had
never
seen
me
could
love
me
very
much
especially
when
he
had
never
written
a
word
to
or
about
me
would
i
cry
too
would
i
feel
just
so
lonely
and
forsaken
and
frightened
that
i
have
to
cry
rilla
hopped
out
she
picked
jims
out
of
his
basket
and
took
him
into
her
own
bed
his
hands
were
cold
poor
mite
but
he
had
promptly
ceased
to
cry
and
then
as
she
held
him
close
to
her
in
the
darkness
suddenly
jims
laughed
a
real
gurgly
chuckly
delighted
delightful
laugh
oh
you
dear
little
thing
exclaimed
rilla
are
you
so
pleased
at
finding
you
not
all
alone
lost
in
a
huge
big
black
room
then
she
knew
she
wanted
to
kiss
him
and
she
did
she
kissed
his
silky
scented
little
head
she
kissed
his
chubby
little
cheek
she
kissed
his
little
cold
hands
she
wanted
to
squeeze
him
to
cuddle
him
just
as
she
used
to
squeeze
and
cuddle
her
kittens
something
delightful
and
yearning
and
brooding
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
her
she
had
never
felt
like
this
before
in
a
few
minutes
jims
was
sound
asleep
and
as
rilla
listened
to
his
soft
regular
breathing
and
felt
the
little
body
warm
and
contented
against
her
she
realized
that
at
last
she
loved
her
he
has
got
to
be
such
a
darling
she
thought
drowsily
as
she
drifted
off
to
slumberland
herself
in
february
jem
and
jerry
and
robert
grant
were
in
the
trenches
and
a
little
more
tension
and
dread
was
added
to
the
ingleside
life
in
march
yiprez
as
susan
called
it
had
come
to
have
a
bitter
significance
the
daily
list
of
casualties
had
begun
to
appear
in
the
papers
and
no
one
at
ingleside
ever
answered
the
telephone
without
a
horrible
cold
shrinking
for
it
might
be
the
phoning
up
to
say
a
telegram
had
come
from
overseas
no
one
at
ingleside
ever
got
up
in
the
morning
without
a
sudden
piercing
wonder
over
what
the
day
might
bring
and
i
used
to
welcome
the
mornings
so
thought
rilla
yet
the
round
of
life
and
duty
went
steadily
on
and
every
week
or
so
one
of
the
glen
lads
who
had
just
the
other
day
been
a
rollicking
schoolboy
went
into
khaki
it
is
bitter
cold
out
tonight
dear
said
susan
coming
in
out
of
the
clear
starlit
crispness
of
the
canadian
winter
twilight
i
wonder
if
the
boys
in
the
trenches
are
warm
how
everything
comes
back
to
this
war
cried
gertrude
oliver
we
ca
get
away
from
it
not
even
when
we
talk
of
the
weather
i
never
go
out
these
dark
cold
nights
myself
without
thinking
of
the
men
in
the
trenches
not
only
our
men
but
everybody
men
i
would
feel
the
same
if
there
were
nobody
i
knew
at
the
front
when
i
snuggle
down
in
my
comfortable
bed
i
am
ashamed
of
being
comfortable
it
seems
as
if
it
were
wicked
of
me
to
be
so
when
many
are
not
i
saw
meredith
down
at
the
store
said
susan
and
she
tells
me
that
they
are
really
troubled
over
bruce
he
takes
things
so
much
to
heart
he
has
cried
himself
to
sleep
for
a
week
over
the
starving
belgians
mother
he
will
say
to
her
so
the
babies
are
never
hungry
oh
not
the
babies
mother
just
say
the
babies
are
not
hungry
mother
and
she
can
not
say
it
because
it
would
not
be
true
and
she
is
at
her
wits
end
they
try
to
keep
such
things
from
him
but
he
finds
them
out
and
then
they
can
not
comfort
him
it
breaks
my
heart
to
read
about
them
myself
dear
and
i
can
not
console
myself
with
the
thought
that
the
tales
are
not
true
when
i
read
a
novel
that
makes
me
want
to
weep
i
just
say
severely
to
myself
susan
baker
you
know
that
is
all
a
pack
of
lies
but
we
must
carry
on
jack
crawford
says
he
is
going
to
the
war
because
he
is
tired
of
farming
i
hope
he
will
find
it
a
pleasant
change
and
richard
elliott
is
worrying
herself
sick
because
she
used
to
be
always
scolding
her
husband
about
smoking
up
the
parlour
curtains
now
that
he
has
enlisted
she
wishes
she
had
never
said
a
word
to
him
you
know
josiah
cooper
and
william
daley
dear
they
used
to
be
fast
friends
but
they
quarrelled
twenty
years
ago
and
have
never
spoken
since
well
the
other
day
josiah
went
to
william
and
said
right
out
us
be
friends
any
time
to
be
holding
grudges
william
was
real
glad
and
held
out
his
hand
and
they
sat
down
for
a
good
talk
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
had
quarrelled
again
over
how
the
war
ought
to
be
fought
josiah
holding
that
the
dardanelles
expedition
was
rank
folly
and
william
maintaining
that
it
was
the
one
sensible
thing
the
allies
had
done
and
now
they
are
madder
at
each
other
than
ever
and
william
says
josiah
is
as
bad
a
as
vows
he
is
no
but
calls
himself
a
pacifist
whatever
that
may
be
it
is
nothing
proper
or
whiskers
would
not
be
it
and
that
you
may
tie
to
he
says
that
the
big
british
victory
at
new
chapelle
cost
more
than
it
was
worth
and
he
has
forbid
joe
milgrave
to
come
near
the
house
because
joe
ran
up
his
father
flag
when
the
news
came
have
you
noticed
dear
that
the
czar
has
changed
that
prish
name
to
premysl
which
proves
that
the
man
had
good
sense
russian
though
he
is
joe
vickers
told
me
in
the
store
that
he
saw
a
very
queer
looking
thing
in
the
sky
tonight
over
lowbridge
way
do
you
suppose
it
could
have
been
a
zeppelin
dr
dear
i
do
not
think
it
very
likely
susan
well
i
would
feel
easier
about
it
if
were
not
living
in
the
glen
they
say
he
was
seen
going
through
strange
manoeuvres
with
a
lantern
in
his
back
yard
one
night
lately
some
people
think
he
was
signalling
to
whom
or
what
ah
that
is
the
mystery
dear
in
my
opinion
the
government
would
do
well
to
keep
an
eye
on
that
man
if
it
does
not
want
us
to
be
all
murdered
in
our
beds
some
night
now
i
shall
just
look
over
the
papers
a
minute
before
going
to
write
a
letter
to
little
jem
two
things
i
never
did
dear
were
write
letters
and
read
politics
yet
here
i
am
doing
both
regular
and
i
find
there
is
something
in
politics
after
all
whatever
woodrow
wilson
means
i
can
not
fathom
but
i
am
hoping
i
will
puzzle
it
out
yet
susan
in
her
pursuit
of
wilson
and
politics
presently
came
upon
something
that
disturbed
her
and
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
bitter
disappointment
that
devilish
kaiser
has
only
a
boil
after
all
do
swear
susan
said
blythe
pulling
a
long
face
is
not
swearing
doctor
dear
i
have
always
understood
that
swearing
was
taking
the
name
of
the
almighty
in
vain
well
it
is
ahem
refined
said
the
doctor
winking
at
miss
oliver
no
doctor
dear
the
devil
and
the
kaiser
if
so
be
that
they
are
really
two
different
people
are
not
refined
and
you
can
not
refer
to
them
in
a
refined
way
so
i
abide
by
what
i
said
although
you
may
notice
that
i
am
careful
not
to
use
such
expressions
when
young
rilla
is
about
and
i
maintain
that
the
papers
have
no
right
to
say
that
the
kaiser
has
pneumonia
and
raise
people
hopes
and
then
come
out
and
say
he
has
nothing
but
a
boil
a
boil
indeed
i
wish
he
was
covered
with
them
susan
stalked
out
to
the
kitchen
and
settled
down
to
write
to
jem
deeming
him
in
need
of
some
home
comfort
from
certain
passages
in
his
letter
that
day
we
in
an
old
wine
cellar
tonight
dad
he
wrote
in
water
to
our
knees
rats
everywhere
no
fire
a
drizzling
rain
coming
down
rather
dismal
but
it
might
be
worse
i
got
susan
box
today
and
everything
was
in
order
and
we
had
a
feast
jerry
is
up
the
line
somewhere
and
he
says
the
rations
are
rather
worse
than
aunt
martha
ditto
used
to
be
but
here
they
not
bad
only
monotonous
tell
susan
i
give
a
year
pay
for
a
good
batch
of
her
but
do
let
that
inspire
her
to
send
any
for
they
would
keep
we
have
been
under
fire
since
the
last
week
in
february
one
boy
he
was
a
nova
scotian
was
killed
right
beside
me
yesterday
a
shell
burst
near
us
and
when
the
mess
cleared
away
he
was
lying
dead
not
mangled
at
all
he
just
looked
a
little
startled
it
was
the
first
time
been
close
to
anything
like
that
and
it
was
a
nasty
sensation
but
one
soon
gets
used
to
horrors
here
we
in
an
absolutely
different
world
the
only
things
that
are
the
same
are
the
stars
and
they
are
never
in
their
right
places
somehow
tell
mother
not
to
worry
i
all
right
fit
as
a
fiddle
and
glad
i
came
there
something
across
from
us
here
that
has
got
to
be
wiped
out
of
the
world
that
all
an
emanation
of
evil
that
would
otherwise
poison
life
for
ever
it
got
to
be
done
dad
however
long
it
takes
and
whatever
it
costs
and
you
tell
the
glen
people
this
for
me
they
do
realize
yet
what
it
is
has
broken
loose
i
did
when
i
first
joined
up
i
thought
it
was
fun
well
it
is
but
i
in
the
right
place
all
right
make
no
mistake
about
that
when
i
saw
what
had
been
done
here
to
homes
and
gardens
and
people
well
dad
i
seemed
to
see
a
gang
of
huns
marching
through
rainbow
valley
and
the
glen
and
the
garden
at
ingleside
there
were
gardens
over
here
beautiful
gardens
with
the
beauty
of
centuries
and
what
are
they
now
mangled
desecrated
things
we
are
fighting
to
make
those
dear
old
places
where
we
had
played
as
children
safe
for
other
boys
and
girls
fighting
for
the
preservation
and
safety
of
all
sweet
wholesome
things
whenever
any
of
you
go
to
the
station
be
sure
to
give
dog
monday
a
double
pat
for
me
fancy
the
faithful
little
beggar
waiting
there
for
me
like
that
honestly
dad
on
some
of
these
dark
cold
nights
in
the
trenches
it
heartens
and
braces
me
up
no
end
to
think
that
thousands
of
miles
away
at
the
old
glen
station
there
is
a
small
spotted
dog
sharing
my
vigil
tell
rilla
i
glad
her
is
turning
out
so
well
and
tell
susan
that
i
fighting
a
good
fight
against
both
huns
and
cooties
dear
whispered
susan
solemnly
what
are
cooties
blythe
whispered
back
and
then
said
in
reply
to
susan
horrified
ejaculations
it
always
like
that
in
the
trenches
susan
susan
shook
her
head
and
went
away
in
grim
silence
to
a
parcel
she
had
sewed
up
for
jem
and
slip
in
a
fine
tooth
comb
chapter
xii
in
the
days
of
langemarck
how
can
spring
come
and
be
beautiful
in
such
a
horror
wrote
rilla
in
her
diary
when
the
sun
shines
and
the
fluffy
yellow
catkins
are
coming
out
on
the
down
by
the
brook
and
the
garden
is
beginning
to
be
beautiful
i
ca
realize
that
such
dreadful
things
are
happening
in
flanders
but
they
are
this
past
week
has
been
terrible
for
us
all
since
the
news
came
of
the
fighting
around
ypres
and
the
battles
of
langemarck
and
julien
our
canadian
boys
have
done
splendidly
general
french
says
they
the
situation
when
the
germans
had
all
but
broken
through
but
i
ca
feel
pride
or
exultation
or
anything
but
a
gnawing
anxiety
over
jem
and
jerry
and
grant
the
casualty
lists
are
coming
out
in
the
papers
every
day
oh
there
are
so
many
of
them
i
ca
bear
to
read
them
for
fear
i
find
jem
name
for
there
have
been
cases
where
people
have
seen
their
boys
names
in
the
casualty
lists
before
the
official
telegram
came
as
for
the
telephone
for
a
day
or
two
i
just
refused
to
answer
it
because
i
thought
i
could
not
endure
the
horrible
moment
that
came
between
saying
and
hearing
the
response
that
moment
seemed
a
hundred
years
long
for
i
was
always
dreading
to
hear
is
a
telegram
for
dr
blythe
then
when
i
had
shirked
for
a
while
i
was
ashamed
of
leaving
it
all
for
mother
or
susan
and
now
i
make
myself
go
but
it
never
gets
any
easier
gertrude
teaches
school
and
reads
compositions
and
sets
examination
papers
just
as
she
always
has
done
but
i
know
her
thoughts
are
over
in
flanders
all
the
time
her
eyes
haunt
me
and
kenneth
is
in
khaki
now
too
he
has
got
a
lieutenant
commission
and
expects
to
go
overseas
in
midsummer
so
he
wrote
me
there
much
else
in
the
letter
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
nothing
but
going
overseas
i
shall
not
see
him
again
before
he
goes
perhaps
i
will
never
see
him
again
sometimes
i
ask
myself
if
that
evening
at
four
winds
was
all
a
dream
it
might
as
well
be
it
seems
as
if
it
happened
in
another
life
lived
years
ago
and
everybody
has
forgotten
it
but
me
walter
and
nan
and
di
came
home
last
night
from
redmond
when
walter
stepped
off
the
train
dog
monday
rushed
to
meet
him
frantic
with
joy
i
suppose
he
thought
jem
would
be
there
too
after
the
first
moment
he
paid
no
attention
to
walter
and
his
pats
but
just
stood
there
wagging
his
tail
nervously
and
looking
past
walter
at
the
other
people
coming
out
with
eyes
that
made
me
choke
up
for
i
could
help
thinking
that
for
all
we
knew
monday
might
never
see
jem
come
off
that
train
again
then
when
all
the
people
were
out
monday
looked
up
at
walter
gave
his
hand
a
little
lick
as
if
to
say
know
it
your
fault
he
did
come
excuse
me
for
feeling
disappointed
and
then
he
trotted
back
to
his
shed
with
that
funny
little
sidelong
waggle
of
his
that
always
makes
it
seem
that
his
hind
legs
are
travelling
directly
away
from
the
point
at
which
his
forelegs
are
aiming
we
tried
to
coax
him
home
with
us
di
even
got
down
and
kissed
him
between
the
eyes
and
said
old
duck
wo
you
come
up
with
us
just
for
the
evening
and
monday
said
he
did
am
very
sorry
but
i
ca
i
got
a
date
to
meet
jem
here
you
know
and
there
a
train
goes
through
at
eight
it
lovely
to
have
walter
back
again
though
he
seems
quiet
and
sad
just
as
he
was
at
christmas
but
i
going
to
love
him
hard
and
cheer
him
up
and
make
him
laugh
as
he
used
to
it
seems
to
me
that
every
day
of
my
life
walter
means
more
to
me
the
other
evening
susan
happened
to
say
that
the
mayflowers
were
out
in
rainbow
valley
i
chanced
to
be
looking
at
mother
when
susan
spoke
her
face
changed
and
she
gave
a
queer
little
choked
cry
most
of
the
time
mother
is
so
spunky
and
gay
you
would
never
guess
what
she
feels
inside
but
now
and
then
some
little
thing
is
too
much
for
her
and
we
see
under
the
surface
she
said
brought
me
mayflowers
last
year
and
she
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
room
i
would
have
rushed
off
to
rainbow
valley
and
brought
her
an
armful
of
mayflowers
but
i
knew
that
was
what
she
wanted
and
after
walter
got
home
last
night
he
slipped
away
to
the
valley
and
brought
mother
home
all
the
mayflowers
he
could
find
nobody
had
said
a
word
to
him
about
it
he
just
remembered
himself
that
jem
used
to
bring
mother
the
first
mayflowers
and
so
he
brought
them
in
jem
place
it
shows
how
tender
and
thoughtful
he
is
and
yet
there
are
people
who
send
him
cruel
letters
it
seems
strange
that
we
can
go
in
with
ordinary
life
just
as
if
nothing
were
happening
overseas
that
concerned
us
just
as
if
any
day
might
not
bring
us
awful
news
but
we
can
and
do
susan
is
putting
in
the
garden
and
mother
and
she
are
housecleaning
and
we
junior
reds
are
getting
up
a
concert
in
aid
of
the
belgians
we
have
been
practising
for
a
month
and
having
no
end
of
trouble
and
bother
with
cranky
people
miranda
pryor
promised
to
help
with
a
dialogue
and
when
she
had
her
part
all
learnt
her
father
put
his
foot
down
and
refused
to
allow
her
to
help
at
all
i
am
not
blaming
miranda
exactly
but
i
do
think
she
might
have
a
little
more
spunk
sometimes
if
she
put
her
foot
down
once
in
a
while
she
might
bring
her
father
to
terms
for
she
is
all
the
housekeeper
he
has
and
what
would
he
do
if
she
if
i
were
in
miranda
shoes
i
find
some
way
of
managing
i
would
him
or
bite
him
if
nothing
else
would
serve
but
miranda
is
a
meek
and
obedient
daughter
whose
days
should
be
long
in
the
land
i
could
get
anyone
else
to
take
the
part
because
nobody
liked
it
so
finally
i
had
to
take
it
myself
olive
kirk
is
on
the
concert
committee
and
goes
against
me
in
every
single
thing
but
i
got
my
way
in
asking
channing
to
come
out
from
town
and
sing
for
us
anyhow
she
is
a
beautiful
singer
and
will
draw
such
a
crowd
that
we
will
make
more
than
we
will
have
to
pay
her
olive
kirk
thought
our
local
talent
good
enough
and
minnie
clow
wo
sing
at
all
now
in
the
choruses
because
she
would
be
so
nervous
before
channing
and
minnie
is
the
only
good
alto
we
have
there
are
times
when
i
am
so
exasperated
that
i
feel
tempted
to
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
affair
but
after
i
dance
round
my
room
a
few
times
in
sheer
rage
i
cool
down
and
have
another
whack
at
it
just
at
present
i
am
racked
with
worry
for
fear
the
isaac
reeses
are
taking
they
have
all
got
a
dreadful
cold
and
there
are
five
of
them
who
have
important
parts
in
the
programme
and
if
they
go
and
develop
what
shall
i
do
dick
reese
violin
solo
is
to
be
one
of
our
titbits
and
kit
reese
is
in
every
tableau
and
the
three
small
girls
have
the
cutest
i
been
toiling
for
weeks
to
train
them
in
it
and
now
it
seems
likely
that
all
my
trouble
will
go
for
nothing
jims
cut
his
first
tooth
today
i
am
very
glad
for
he
is
nearly
nine
months
old
and
mary
vance
has
been
insinuating
that
he
is
awfully
backward
about
cutting
his
teeth
he
has
begun
to
creep
but
crawl
as
most
babies
do
he
trots
about
on
all
fours
and
carries
things
in
his
mouth
like
a
little
dog
nobody
can
say
he
is
up
to
schedule
time
in
the
matter
of
creeping
anyway
away
ahead
of
it
indeed
since
ten
months
is
morgan
average
for
creeping
he
is
so
cute
it
will
be
a
shame
if
his
dad
never
sees
him
his
hair
is
coming
on
nicely
too
and
i
am
not
without
hope
that
it
will
be
curly
just
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
been
writing
of
jims
and
the
concert
i
forgotten
ypres
and
the
poison
gas
and
the
casualty
lists
now
it
all
rushes
back
worse
than
ever
oh
if
we
could
just
know
that
jem
is
all
right
i
used
to
be
so
furious
with
jem
when
he
called
me
spider
and
now
if
he
would
just
come
whistling
through
the
hall
and
call
out
spider
as
he
used
to
do
i
would
think
it
the
loveliest
name
in
the
world
rilla
put
away
her
diary
and
went
out
to
the
garden
the
spring
evening
was
very
lovely
the
long
green
glen
was
filled
with
dusk
and
beyond
it
were
meadows
of
sunset
the
harbour
was
radiant
purple
here
azure
there
opal
elsewhere
the
maple
grove
was
beginning
to
be
misty
green
rilla
looked
about
her
with
wistful
eyes
who
said
that
spring
was
the
joy
of
the
year
it
was
the
of
the
year
and
the
mornings
and
the
daffodil
stars
and
the
wind
in
the
old
pine
were
so
many
separate
pangs
of
the
would
life
ever
be
free
from
dread
again
it
good
to
see
twilight
once
more
said
walter
joining
her
i
did
really
remember
that
the
sea
was
so
blue
and
the
roads
so
red
and
the
wood
nooks
so
wild
and
fairy
haunted
yes
the
fairies
still
abide
here
i
vow
i
could
find
scores
of
them
under
the
violets
in
rainbow
valley
rilla
was
momentarily
happy
this
sounded
like
the
walter
of
yore
she
hoped
he
was
forgetting
certain
things
that
had
troubled
him
and
is
the
sky
blue
over
rainbow
valley
she
said
responding
to
his
mood
blue
blue
you
have
to
say
a
hundred
times
before
you
could
express
how
blue
it
is
susan
wandered
by
her
head
tied
up
with
a
shawl
her
hands
full
of
garden
implements
doc
stealthy
and
was
shadowing
her
steps
among
the
spirea
bushes
the
sky
may
be
blue
said
susan
but
that
cat
has
been
hyde
all
day
so
we
will
likely
have
rain
tonight
and
by
the
same
token
i
have
rheumatism
in
my
shoulder
it
may
rain
but
do
think
rheumatism
susan
think
violets
said
walter
gaily
rather
too
gaily
rilla
thought
susan
considered
him
unsympathetic
indeed
walter
dear
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
thinking
violets
she
responded
stiffly
and
rheumatism
is
not
a
thing
to
be
joked
about
as
you
may
some
day
realize
for
yourself
i
hope
i
am
not
of
the
kind
that
is
always
complaining
of
their
aches
and
pains
especially
now
when
the
news
is
so
terrible
rheumatism
is
bad
enough
but
i
realize
and
none
better
that
it
is
not
to
be
compared
to
being
gassed
by
the
huns
oh
my
god
no
exclaimed
walter
passionately
he
turned
and
went
back
to
the
house
susan
shook
her
head
she
disapproved
entirely
of
such
ejaculations
i
hope
he
will
not
let
his
mother
hear
him
talking
like
that
she
thought
as
she
stacked
the
hoes
and
rake
away
rilla
was
standing
among
the
budding
daffodils
with
eyes
her
evening
was
spoiled
she
detested
susan
who
had
somehow
hurt
walter
and
jem
had
jem
been
gassed
had
he
died
in
torture
i
ca
endure
this
suspense
any
longer
said
rilla
desperately
but
she
endured
it
as
the
others
did
for
another
week
then
a
letter
came
from
jem
he
was
all
right
i
come
through
without
a
scratch
dad
do
know
how
i
or
any
of
us
did
it
you
have
seen
all
about
it
in
the
papers
i
ca
write
of
it
but
the
huns
have
got
through
they
wo
get
through
jerry
was
knocked
stiff
by
a
shell
one
time
but
it
was
only
the
shock
he
was
all
right
in
a
few
days
grant
is
safe
too
nan
had
a
letter
from
jerry
meredith
i
came
back
to
consciousness
at
dawn
he
wrote
could
tell
what
had
happened
to
me
but
thought
that
i
was
done
for
i
was
all
alone
and
afraid
terribly
afraid
dead
men
were
all
around
me
lying
on
the
horrible
grey
slimy
fields
i
was
woefully
thirsty
and
i
thought
of
david
and
the
bethlehem
water
and
of
the
old
spring
in
rainbow
valley
under
the
maples
i
seemed
to
see
it
just
before
me
and
you
standing
laughing
on
the
other
side
of
it
and
i
thought
it
was
all
over
with
me
and
i
did
care
honestly
i
did
care
i
just
felt
a
dreadful
childish
fear
of
loneliness
and
of
those
dead
men
around
me
and
a
sort
of
wonder
how
this
could
have
happened
to
me
then
they
found
me
and
carted
me
off
and
before
long
i
discovered
that
there
was
really
anything
wrong
with
me
i
going
back
to
the
trenches
tomorrow
every
man
is
needed
there
that
can
be
got
laughter
is
gone
out
of
the
world
said
faith
meredith
who
had
come
over
to
report
on
her
letters
i
remember
telling
old
taylor
long
ago
that
the
world
was
a
world
of
laughter
but
it
is
so
any
longer
it
a
shriek
of
anguish
said
gertrude
oliver
we
must
keep
a
little
laughter
girls
said
blythe
a
good
laugh
is
as
good
as
a
prayer
sometimes
only
sometimes
she
added
under
her
breath
she
had
found
it
very
hard
to
laugh
during
the
three
weeks
she
had
just
lived
through
she
anne
blythe
to
whom
laughter
had
always
come
so
easily
and
freshly
and
what
hurt
most
was
that
rilla
laughter
had
grown
so
rare
rilla
whom
she
used
to
think
laughed
was
all
the
child
girlhood
to
be
so
clouded
yet
how
strong
and
clever
and
womanly
she
was
growing
how
patiently
she
knitted
and
sewed
and
manipulated
those
uncertain
junior
reds
and
how
wonderful
she
was
with
jims
she
really
could
not
do
better
for
that
child
than
if
she
had
raised
a
baker
dozen
dear
susan
had
avowed
solemnly
little
did
i
ever
expect
it
of
her
on
the
day
she
landed
here
with
that
soup
tureen
chapter
xiii
a
slice
of
humble
pie
i
am
very
much
afraid
dear
said
susan
who
had
been
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
station
with
some
choice
bones
for
dog
monday
that
something
terrible
has
happened
came
off
the
train
from
charlottetown
and
he
was
looking
pleased
i
do
not
remember
that
i
ever
saw
him
with
a
smile
on
in
public
before
of
course
he
may
have
just
been
getting
the
better
of
somebody
in
a
cattle
deal
but
i
have
an
awful
presentiment
that
the
huns
have
broken
through
somewhere
perhaps
susan
was
unjust
in
connecting
pryor
smile
with
the
sinking
of
the
lusitania
news
of
which
circulated
an
hour
later
when
the
mail
was
distributed
but
the
glen
boys
turned
out
that
night
in
a
body
and
broke
all
his
windows
in
a
fine
frenzy
of
indignation
over
the
kaiser
doings
i
do
not
say
they
did
right
and
i
do
not
say
they
did
wrong
said
susan
when
she
heard
of
it
but
i
will
say
that
i
would
have
minded
throwing
a
few
stones
myself
one
thing
is
certain
said
in
the
post
office
the
day
the
news
came
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
that
folks
who
could
not
stay
home
after
they
had
been
warned
deserved
no
better
fate
norman
douglas
is
fairly
foaming
at
the
mouth
over
it
all
the
devil
does
get
those
men
who
sunk
the
lusitania
then
there
is
no
use
in
there
being
a
devil
he
was
shouting
in
carter
store
last
night
norman
douglas
always
has
believed
that
anybody
who
opposed
him
was
on
the
side
of
the
devil
but
a
man
like
that
is
bound
to
be
right
once
in
a
while
bruce
meredith
is
worrying
over
the
babies
who
were
drowned
and
it
seems
he
prayed
for
something
very
special
last
friday
night
and
did
get
it
and
was
feeling
quite
disgruntled
over
it
but
when
he
heard
about
the
lusitania
he
told
his
mother
that
he
understood
now
why
god
answer
his
prayer
he
was
too
busy
attending
to
the
souls
of
all
the
people
who
went
down
on
the
lusitania
that
child
brain
is
a
hundred
years
older
than
his
body
dear
as
for
the
lusitania
it
is
an
awful
occurrence
whatever
way
you
look
at
it
but
woodrow
wilson
is
going
to
write
a
note
about
it
so
why
worry
a
pretty
president
and
susan
banged
her
pots
about
wrathfully
president
wilson
was
rapidly
becoming
anathema
in
susan
kitchen
mary
vance
dropped
in
one
evening
to
tell
the
ingleside
folks
that
she
had
withdrawn
all
opposition
to
miller
douglas
enlisting
this
lusitania
business
was
too
much
for
me
said
mary
brusquely
when
the
kaiser
takes
to
drowning
innocent
babies
it
high
time
somebody
told
him
where
he
gets
off
at
this
thing
must
be
fought
to
a
finish
it
been
soaking
into
my
mind
slow
but
i
on
now
so
i
up
and
told
miller
he
could
go
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
old
kitty
alec
be
converted
though
if
every
ship
in
the
world
was
submarined
and
every
baby
drowned
kitty
would
turn
a
hair
but
i
flatter
myself
that
it
was
me
kept
miller
back
all
along
and
not
the
fair
kitty
i
may
have
deceived
myself
but
we
shall
see
they
did
see
the
next
sunday
miller
douglas
walked
into
the
glen
church
beside
mary
vance
in
khaki
and
mary
was
so
proud
of
him
that
her
white
eyes
fairly
blazed
joe
milgrave
back
under
the
gallery
looked
at
miller
and
mary
and
then
at
miranda
pryor
and
sighed
so
heavily
that
every
one
within
a
radius
of
three
pews
heard
him
and
knew
what
his
trouble
was
walter
blythe
did
not
sigh
but
rilla
scanning
his
face
anxiously
saw
a
look
that
cut
into
her
heart
it
haunted
her
for
the
next
week
and
made
an
undercurrent
of
soreness
in
her
soul
which
was
externally
being
harrowed
up
by
the
near
approach
of
the
red
cross
concert
and
the
worries
connected
therewith
the
reese
cold
had
not
developed
into
so
that
tangle
was
straightened
out
but
other
things
were
hanging
in
the
balance
and
on
the
very
day
before
the
concert
came
a
regretful
letter
from
channing
saying
that
she
could
not
come
to
sing
her
son
who
was
in
kingsport
with
his
regiment
was
seriously
ill
with
pneumonia
and
she
must
go
to
him
at
once
the
members
of
the
concert
committee
looked
at
each
other
in
blank
dismay
what
was
to
be
done
this
comes
of
depending
on
outside
help
said
olive
kirk
disagreeably
we
must
do
something
said
rilla
too
desperate
to
care
for
manner
we
advertised
the
concert
everywhere
and
crowds
are
coming
there
even
a
big
party
coming
out
from
town
and
we
were
short
enough
of
music
as
it
was
we
must
get
some
one
to
sing
in
channing
place
i
do
know
who
you
can
get
at
this
late
date
said
olive
irene
howard
could
do
it
but
it
is
not
likely
she
will
after
the
way
she
was
insulted
by
our
society
how
did
our
society
insult
her
asked
rilla
in
what
she
called
her
tone
its
coldness
and
pallor
did
not
daunt
olive
you
insulted
her
she
answered
sharply
irene
told
me
all
about
it
she
was
literally
you
told
her
never
to
speak
to
you
again
and
irene
told
me
she
simply
could
not
imagine
what
she
had
said
or
done
to
deserve
such
treatment
that
was
why
she
never
came
to
our
meetings
again
but
joined
in
with
the
lowbridge
red
cross
i
do
not
blame
her
in
the
least
and
i
for
one
will
not
ask
her
to
lower
herself
by
helping
us
out
of
this
scrape
you
do
expect
me
to
ask
her
giggled
amy
macallister
the
other
member
of
the
committee
irene
and
i
have
spoken
for
a
hundred
years
irene
is
always
getting
by
somebody
but
she
is
a
lovely
singer
i
admit
that
and
people
would
just
as
soon
hear
her
as
mrs
channing
it
would
do
any
good
if
you
did
ask
her
said
olive
significantly
soon
after
we
began
planning
this
concert
back
in
april
i
met
irene
in
town
one
day
and
asked
her
if
she
would
help
us
out
she
said
she
love
to
but
she
really
did
see
how
she
could
when
rilla
blythe
was
running
the
programme
after
the
strange
way
rilla
had
behaved
to
her
so
there
it
is
and
here
we
are
and
a
nice
failure
our
concert
will
be
rilla
went
home
and
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
her
soul
in
a
turmoil
she
would
not
humiliate
herself
by
apologizing
to
irene
howard
irene
had
been
as
much
in
the
wrong
as
she
had
been
and
she
had
told
such
mean
distorted
versions
of
their
quarrel
everywhere
posing
as
a
puzzled
injured
martyr
rilla
could
never
bring
herself
to
tell
her
side
of
it
the
fact
that
a
slur
at
walter
was
mixed
up
in
it
tied
her
tongue
so
most
people
believed
that
irene
had
been
badly
used
except
a
few
girls
who
had
never
liked
her
and
sided
with
rilla
and
yet
the
concert
over
which
she
had
worked
so
hard
was
going
to
be
a
failure
channing
four
solos
were
the
feature
of
the
whole
programme
miss
oliver
what
do
you
think
about
it
she
asked
in
desperation
i
think
irene
is
the
one
who
should
apologize
said
miss
oliver
but
unfortunately
my
opinion
will
not
fill
the
blanks
in
your
programme
if
i
went
and
apologized
meekly
to
irene
she
would
sing
i
am
sure
sighed
rilla
she
really
loves
to
sing
in
public
but
i
know
she
be
nasty
about
it
i
feel
i
rather
do
anything
than
go
i
suppose
i
should
go
if
jem
and
jerry
can
face
the
huns
surely
i
can
face
irene
howard
and
swallow
my
pride
to
ask
a
favour
of
her
for
the
good
of
the
belgians
just
at
present
i
feel
that
i
can
not
do
it
but
for
all
that
i
have
a
presentiment
that
after
supper
you
see
me
meekly
trotting
through
rainbow
valley
on
my
way
to
the
upper
glen
road
rilla
presentiment
proved
correct
after
supper
she
dressed
herself
carefully
in
her
blue
beaded
crepe
for
vanity
is
harder
to
quell
than
pride
and
irene
always
saw
any
flaw
or
shortcoming
in
another
appearance
besides
as
rilla
had
told
her
mother
one
day
when
she
was
nine
years
old
it
is
easier
to
behave
nicely
when
you
have
your
good
clothes
on
rilla
did
her
hair
very
becomingly
and
donned
a
long
raincoat
for
fear
of
a
shower
but
all
the
while
her
thoughts
were
concerned
with
the
coming
distasteful
interview
and
she
kept
rehearsing
mentally
her
part
in
it
she
wished
it
were
over
she
wished
she
had
never
tried
to
get
up
a
belgian
relief
concert
she
wished
she
had
not
quarreled
with
irene
after
all
disdainful
silence
would
have
been
much
more
effective
in
meeting
the
slur
upon
walter
it
was
foolish
and
childish
to
fly
out
as
she
had
done
well
she
would
be
wiser
in
the
future
but
meanwhile
a
large
and
very
unpalatable
slice
of
humble
pie
had
to
be
eaten
and
rilla
blythe
was
no
fonder
of
that
wholesome
article
of
diet
than
the
rest
of
us
by
sunset
she
was
at
the
door
of
the
howard
house
a
pretentious
abode
with
white
round
the
eaves
and
an
eruption
of
on
all
its
sides
howard
a
plump
voluble
dame
met
rilla
gushingly
and
left
her
in
the
parlour
while
she
went
to
call
irene
rilla
threw
off
her
and
looked
at
herself
critically
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantel
hair
hat
and
dress
were
satisfactory
nothing
there
for
miss
irene
to
make
fun
of
rilla
remembered
how
clever
and
amusing
she
used
to
think
irene
biting
little
comments
about
other
girls
well
it
had
come
home
to
her
now
presently
irene
skimmed
down
elegantly
gowned
with
her
pale
hair
done
in
the
latest
and
most
extreme
fashion
and
an
atmosphere
of
perfume
enveloping
her
why
how
do
you
do
miss
blythe
she
said
sweetly
this
is
a
very
unexpected
pleasure
rilla
had
risen
to
take
irene
chilly
and
now
as
she
sat
down
again
she
saw
something
that
temporarily
stunned
her
irene
saw
it
too
as
she
sat
down
and
a
little
amused
impertinent
smile
appeared
on
her
lips
and
hovered
there
during
the
rest
of
the
interview
on
one
of
rilla
feet
was
a
smart
little
shoe
and
a
filmy
blue
silk
stocking
the
other
was
clad
in
a
stout
and
rather
shabby
boot
and
black
lisle
poor
rilla
she
had
changed
or
begun
to
change
her
boots
and
stockings
after
she
had
put
on
her
dress
this
was
the
result
of
doing
one
thing
with
your
hands
and
another
with
your
brain
oh
what
a
ridiculous
position
to
be
in
and
before
irene
howard
of
all
people
irene
who
was
staring
at
rilla
feet
as
if
she
had
never
seen
feet
before
and
once
she
had
thought
irene
manner
perfection
everything
that
rilla
had
prepared
to
say
vanished
from
her
memory
vainly
trying
to
tuck
her
unlucky
foot
under
her
chair
she
blurted
out
a
blunt
statement
i
have
come
to
athk
a
favour
of
you
irene
there
lisping
oh
she
had
been
prepared
for
humiliation
but
not
to
this
extent
really
there
were
limits
yes
said
irene
in
a
cool
questioning
tone
lifting
her
insolent
eyes
to
rilla
crimson
face
for
a
moment
and
then
dropping
them
again
as
if
she
could
not
tear
them
from
their
fascinated
gaze
at
the
shabby
boot
and
the
gallant
shoe
rilla
gathered
herself
together
she
would
not
lisp
she
would
be
calm
and
composed
channing
can
not
come
because
her
son
is
ill
in
kingsport
and
i
have
come
on
behalf
of
the
committee
to
ask
you
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
sing
for
us
in
her
place
rilla
enunciated
every
word
so
precisely
and
carefully
that
she
seemed
to
be
reciting
a
lesson
it
something
of
a
fiddler
invitation
is
it
said
irene
with
one
of
her
disagreeable
smiles
olive
kirk
asked
you
to
help
when
we
first
thought
of
the
concert
and
you
refused
said
rilla
why
i
could
hardly
help
then
could
i
asked
irene
plaintively
after
you
ordered
me
never
to
speak
to
you
again
it
would
have
been
very
awkward
for
us
both
do
you
think
now
for
the
humble
pie
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
for
saying
that
irene
said
rilla
steadily
i
should
not
have
said
it
and
i
have
been
very
sorry
ever
since
will
you
forgive
me
and
sing
at
your
concert
said
irene
sweetly
and
insultingly
if
you
mean
said
rilla
miserably
that
i
would
not
be
apologizing
to
you
if
it
were
not
for
the
concert
perhaps
that
is
true
but
it
is
also
true
that
i
have
felt
ever
since
it
happened
that
i
should
not
have
said
what
i
did
and
that
i
have
been
sorry
for
it
all
winter
that
is
all
i
can
say
if
you
feel
you
ca
forgive
me
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
oh
rilla
dear
do
snap
me
up
like
that
pleaded
irene
of
course
i
forgive
you
though
i
did
feel
awfully
about
it
how
awfully
i
hope
you
never
know
i
cried
for
weeks
over
it
and
i
had
said
or
done
a
thing
rilla
choked
back
a
retort
after
all
there
was
no
use
in
arguing
with
irene
and
the
belgians
were
starving
do
you
think
you
can
help
us
with
the
concert
she
forced
herself
to
say
oh
if
only
irene
would
stop
looking
at
that
boot
rilla
could
just
hear
her
giving
olive
kirk
an
account
of
it
i
do
see
how
i
really
can
at
the
last
moment
like
this
protested
irene
there
is
time
to
learn
anything
new
oh
you
have
lots
of
lovely
songs
that
nobody
in
the
glen
ever
heard
before
said
rilla
who
knew
irene
had
been
going
to
town
all
winter
for
lessons
and
that
this
was
only
a
pretext
they
will
all
be
new
down
there
but
i
have
no
accompanist
protested
irene
una
meredith
can
accompany
you
said
rilla
oh
i
could
ask
her
sighed
irene
we
have
spoken
since
last
fall
she
was
so
hateful
to
me
the
time
of
our
concert
that
i
simply
had
to
give
her
up
dear
dear
was
irene
at
feud
with
everybody
as
for
una
meredith
being
hateful
to
anybody
the
idea
was
so
farcical
that
rilla
had
much
ado
to
keep
from
laughing
in
irene
very
face
miss
oliver
is
a
beautiful
pianist
and
can
play
any
accompaniment
at
sight
said
rilla
desperately
she
will
play
for
you
and
you
could
run
over
your
songs
easily
tomorrow
evening
at
ingleside
before
the
concert
but
i
have
anything
to
wear
my
new
is
home
from
charlottetown
yet
and
i
simply
can
not
wear
my
old
one
at
such
a
big
affair
it
is
too
shabby
and
our
concert
said
rilla
slowly
is
in
aid
of
belgian
children
who
are
starving
to
death
do
you
think
you
could
wear
a
shabby
dress
once
for
their
sake
irene
oh
do
you
think
those
accounts
we
get
of
the
conditions
of
the
belgians
are
very
much
exaggerated
said
irene
i
sure
they
be
actually
starving
you
know
in
the
twentieth
century
the
newspapers
always
colour
things
so
highly
rilla
concluded
that
she
had
humiliated
herself
enough
there
was
such
a
thing
as
no
more
coaxing
concert
or
no
concert
she
got
up
boot
and
all
i
am
sorry
you
ca
help
us
irene
but
since
you
can
not
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
now
this
did
not
suit
irene
at
all
she
desired
exceedingly
to
sing
at
that
concert
and
all
her
hesitations
were
merely
by
way
of
enhancing
the
boon
of
her
final
consent
besides
she
really
wanted
to
be
friends
with
rilla
again
rilla
ungrudging
adoration
had
been
very
sweet
incense
to
her
and
ingleside
was
a
very
charming
house
to
visit
especially
when
a
handsome
college
student
like
walter
was
home
she
stopped
looking
at
rilla
feet
rilla
darling
do
be
so
abrupt
i
really
want
to
help
you
if
i
can
manage
it
just
sit
down
and
let
talk
it
over
i
sorry
but
i
ca
i
have
to
be
home
soon
jims
has
to
be
settled
for
the
night
you
know
oh
yes
the
baby
you
are
bringing
up
by
the
book
it
perfectly
sweet
of
you
to
do
it
when
you
hate
children
so
how
cross
you
were
just
because
i
kissed
him
but
we
forget
all
that
and
be
chums
again
wo
we
now
about
the
concert
i
dare
say
i
can
run
into
town
on
the
morning
train
after
my
dress
and
out
again
on
the
afternoon
one
in
plenty
of
time
for
the
concert
if
you
ask
miss
oliver
to
play
for
me
i
could
she
so
dreadfully
haughty
and
supercilious
that
she
simply
paralyses
poor
little
me
rilla
did
not
waste
time
or
breath
defending
miss
oliver
she
coolly
thanked
irene
who
had
suddenly
become
very
amiable
and
gushing
and
got
away
she
was
very
thankful
the
interview
was
over
but
she
knew
now
that
she
and
irene
could
never
be
the
friends
they
had
been
friendly
yes
but
friends
no
nor
did
she
wish
it
all
winter
she
had
felt
under
her
other
and
more
serious
worries
a
little
feeling
of
regret
for
her
lost
chum
now
it
was
suddenly
gone
irene
was
not
as
elliott
would
say
of
the
race
that
knew
joseph
rilla
did
not
say
or
think
that
she
had
outgrown
irene
had
the
thought
occurred
to
her
she
would
have
considered
it
absurd
when
she
was
not
yet
seventeen
and
irene
was
twenty
but
it
was
the
truth
irene
was
just
what
she
had
been
a
year
ago
just
what
she
would
always
be
rilla
blythe
nature
in
that
year
had
changed
and
matured
and
deepened
she
found
herself
seeing
through
irene
with
a
disconcerting
clearness
discerning
under
all
her
superficial
sweetness
her
pettiness
her
vindictiveness
her
insincerity
her
essential
cheapness
irene
had
lost
for
ever
her
faithful
worshipper
but
not
until
rilla
had
traversed
the
upper
glen
road
and
found
herself
in
the
solitude
of
rainbow
valley
did
she
fully
recover
her
composure
of
spirit
then
she
stopped
under
a
tall
wild
plum
that
was
ghostly
white
and
fair
in
its
misty
spring
bloom
and
laughed
there
is
only
one
thing
of
importance
just
now
and
that
is
that
the
allies
win
the
war
she
said
aloud
therefore
it
follows
without
dispute
that
the
fact
that
i
went
to
see
irene
howard
with
odd
shoes
and
stockings
on
is
of
no
importance
whatever
nevertheless
i
bertha
marilla
blythe
swear
solemnly
with
the
moon
as
witness
rilla
lifted
her
hand
dramatically
to
the
said
moon
that
i
will
never
leave
my
room
again
without
looking
carefully
at
both
my
feet
chapter
xiv
the
valley
of
decision
susan
kept
the
flag
flying
at
ingleside
all
the
next
day
in
honour
of
italy
declaration
of
war
and
not
before
it
was
time
dear
considering
the
way
things
have
begun
to
go
on
the
russian
front
say
what
you
will
those
russians
are
kittle
cattle
the
grand
duke
nicholas
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
it
is
a
fortunate
thing
for
italy
that
she
has
come
in
on
the
right
side
but
whether
it
is
as
fortunate
for
the
allies
i
will
not
predict
until
i
know
more
about
italians
than
i
do
now
however
she
will
give
that
old
reprobate
of
a
francis
joseph
something
to
think
about
a
pretty
emperor
indeed
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
and
yet
plotting
wholesale
murder
and
susan
thumped
and
kneaded
her
bread
with
as
much
vicious
energy
as
she
could
have
expended
in
punching
francis
joseph
himself
if
he
had
been
so
unlucky
as
to
fall
into
her
clutches
walter
had
gone
to
town
on
the
early
train
and
nan
offered
to
look
after
jims
for
the
day
and
so
set
rilla
free
rilla
was
wildly
busy
all
day
helping
to
decorate
the
glen
hall
and
seeing
to
a
hundred
last
things
the
evening
was
beautiful
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
pryor
was
reported
to
have
said
that
he
hoped
it
would
rain
pitch
forks
points
down
and
to
have
wantonly
kicked
miranda
dog
as
he
said
it
rilla
rushing
home
from
the
hall
dressed
hurriedly
everything
had
gone
surprisingly
well
at
the
last
irene
was
even
then
downstairs
practising
her
songs
with
miss
oliver
rilla
was
excited
and
happy
forgetful
even
of
the
western
front
for
the
moment
it
gave
her
a
sense
of
achievement
and
victory
to
have
brought
her
efforts
of
weeks
to
such
a
successful
conclusion
she
knew
that
there
had
not
lacked
people
who
thought
and
hinted
that
rilla
blythe
had
not
the
tact
or
patience
to
engineer
a
concert
programme
she
had
shown
them
little
snatches
of
song
bubbled
up
from
her
lips
as
she
dressed
she
thought
she
was
looking
very
well
excitement
brought
a
faint
becoming
pink
into
her
round
creamy
cheeks
quite
drowning
out
her
few
freckles
and
her
hair
gleamed
with
lustre
should
she
wear
blossoms
in
it
or
her
little
fillet
of
pearls
after
some
agonised
wavering
she
decided
on
the
blossoms
and
tucked
the
white
waxen
cluster
behind
her
left
ear
now
for
a
final
look
at
her
feet
yes
both
slippers
were
on
she
gave
the
sleeping
jims
a
kiss
what
a
dear
little
warm
rosy
satin
face
he
had
and
hurried
down
the
hill
to
the
hall
already
it
was
filling
soon
it
was
crowded
her
concert
was
going
to
be
a
brilliant
success
the
first
three
numbers
were
successfully
over
rilla
was
in
the
little
behind
the
platform
looking
out
on
the
moonlit
harbour
and
rehearsing
her
own
recitations
she
was
alone
the
rest
of
the
performers
being
in
the
larger
room
on
the
other
side
suddenly
she
felt
two
soft
bare
arms
slipping
round
her
waist
then
irene
howard
dropped
a
light
kiss
on
her
cheek
rilla
you
sweet
thing
you
looking
simply
angelic
you
have
spunk
i
thought
you
would
feel
so
badly
over
walter
enlisting
that
you
hardly
be
able
to
bear
up
at
all
and
here
you
are
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
i
wish
i
had
half
your
nerve
rilla
stood
perfectly
still
she
felt
no
emotion
whatever
she
felt
nothing
the
world
of
feeling
had
just
gone
blank
walter
enlisting
she
heard
herself
saying
then
she
heard
affected
little
laugh
why
did
you
know
i
thought
you
did
of
course
or
i
would
have
mentioned
it
i
am
always
putting
my
foot
in
it
are
i
yes
that
is
what
he
went
to
town
for
he
told
me
coming
out
on
the
train
i
was
the
first
person
he
told
he
is
in
khaki
yet
they
were
out
of
uniforms
but
he
will
be
in
a
day
or
two
i
always
said
walter
had
as
much
pluck
as
anybody
i
assure
you
i
felt
proud
of
him
rilla
when
he
told
me
what
he
done
oh
there
an
end
of
rick
macallister
reading
i
must
fly
i
promised
i
play
for
the
next
chorus
alice
clow
has
such
a
headache
she
was
gone
oh
thank
god
she
was
gone
rilla
was
alone
again
staring
out
at
the
unchanged
beauty
of
moonlit
four
winds
feeling
was
coming
back
to
her
a
pang
of
agony
so
acute
as
to
be
almost
physical
seemed
to
rend
her
apart
i
can
not
bear
it
she
said
and
then
came
the
awful
thought
that
perhaps
she
could
bear
it
and
that
there
might
be
years
of
this
hideous
suffering
before
her
she
must
get
away
she
must
rush
home
she
must
be
alone
she
could
not
go
out
there
and
play
for
drills
and
give
readings
and
take
part
in
dialogues
now
it
would
spoil
half
the
concert
but
that
did
not
matter
nothing
mattered
was
this
she
rilla
blythe
this
tortured
thing
who
had
been
quite
happy
a
few
minutes
ago
outside
a
quartette
was
singing
we
never
let
the
old
flag
fall
the
music
seemed
to
be
coming
from
some
remote
distance
why
could
she
cry
as
she
had
cried
when
jem
told
them
he
must
go
if
she
could
cry
perhaps
this
horrible
something
that
seemed
to
have
seized
on
her
very
life
might
let
go
but
no
tears
came
where
were
her
scarf
and
coat
she
must
get
away
and
hide
herself
like
an
animal
hurt
to
the
death
was
it
a
coward
part
to
run
away
like
this
the
question
came
to
her
suddenly
as
if
someone
else
had
asked
it
she
thought
of
the
shambles
of
the
flanders
front
she
thought
of
her
brother
and
her
playmate
helping
to
hold
those
trenches
what
would
they
think
of
her
if
she
shirked
her
little
duty
here
the
humble
duty
of
carrying
the
programme
through
for
her
red
cross
but
she
could
stay
she
could
yet
what
was
it
mother
had
said
when
jem
went
when
our
women
fail
in
courage
shall
our
men
be
fearless
still
but
this
this
was
unbearable
still
she
stopped
to
the
door
and
went
back
to
the
window
irene
was
singing
now
her
beautiful
voice
the
only
real
thing
about
her
soared
clear
and
sweet
through
the
building
rilla
knew
that
the
girls
fairy
drill
came
next
could
she
go
out
there
and
play
for
it
her
head
was
aching
now
her
throat
was
burning
oh
why
had
irene
told
her
just
then
when
telling
could
do
no
good
irene
had
been
very
cruel
rilla
remembered
now
that
more
than
once
that
day
she
had
caught
her
mother
looking
at
her
with
an
odd
expression
she
had
been
too
busy
to
wonder
what
it
meant
she
understood
now
mother
had
known
why
walter
went
to
town
but
would
tell
her
until
the
concert
was
over
what
spirit
and
endurance
mother
had
i
must
stay
here
and
see
things
through
said
rilla
clasping
her
cold
hands
together
the
rest
of
the
evening
always
seemed
like
a
fevered
dream
to
her
her
body
was
crowded
by
people
but
her
soul
was
alone
in
a
of
its
own
yet
she
played
steadily
for
the
drills
and
gave
her
readings
without
faltering
she
even
put
on
a
grotesque
old
irish
woman
costume
and
acted
the
part
in
the
dialogue
which
miranda
pryor
had
not
taken
but
she
did
not
give
her
brogue
the
inimitable
twist
she
had
given
it
in
the
practices
and
her
readings
lacked
their
usual
fire
and
appeal
as
she
stood
before
the
audience
she
saw
one
face
only
that
of
the
handsome
lad
sitting
beside
her
mother
and
she
saw
that
same
face
in
the
trenches
saw
it
lying
cold
and
dead
under
the
stars
saw
it
pining
in
prison
saw
the
light
of
its
eyes
blotted
out
saw
a
hundred
horrible
things
as
she
stood
there
on
the
beflagged
platform
of
the
glen
hall
with
her
own
face
whiter
than
the
milky
in
her
hair
between
her
numbers
she
walked
restlessly
up
and
down
the
little
would
the
concert
never
end
it
ended
at
last
olive
kirk
rushed
up
and
told
her
exultantly
that
they
had
made
a
hundred
dollars
that
good
rilla
said
mechanically
then
she
was
away
from
them
all
oh
thank
god
she
was
away
from
them
all
walter
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
door
he
put
his
arm
through
hers
silently
and
they
went
together
down
the
moonlit
road
the
frogs
were
singing
in
the
marshes
the
dim
ensilvered
fields
of
home
lay
all
around
them
the
spring
night
was
lovely
and
appealing
rilla
felt
that
its
beauty
was
an
insult
to
her
pain
she
would
hate
moonlight
for
ever
you
know
said
walter
yes
irene
told
me
answered
rilla
chokingly
we
did
want
you
to
know
till
the
evening
was
over
i
knew
when
you
came
out
for
the
drill
that
you
had
heard
little
sister
i
had
to
do
it
i
could
live
any
longer
on
such
terms
with
myself
as
i
have
been
since
the
lusitania
was
sunk
when
i
pictured
those
dead
women
and
children
floating
about
in
that
pitiless
water
well
at
first
i
just
felt
a
sort
of
nausea
with
life
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
world
where
such
a
thing
could
happen
shake
its
accursed
dust
from
my
feet
for
ever
then
i
knew
i
had
to
go
there
are
plenty
without
you
that
is
the
point
i
going
for
my
own
sake
to
save
my
soul
alive
it
will
shrink
to
something
small
and
mean
and
lifeless
if
i
do
go
that
would
be
worse
than
blindness
or
mutilation
or
any
of
the
things
i
feared
you
may
be
killed
rilla
hated
herself
for
saying
it
she
knew
it
was
a
weak
and
cowardly
thing
to
say
but
she
had
rather
gone
to
pieces
after
the
tension
of
the
evening
he
slow
or
comes
he
fast
it
is
but
death
who
comes
at
last
quoted
walter
it
not
death
i
fear
i
told
you
that
long
ago
one
can
pay
too
high
a
price
for
mere
life
little
sister
there
so
much
hideousness
in
this
war
i
got
to
go
and
help
wipe
it
out
of
the
world
i
going
to
fight
for
the
beauty
of
life
that
is
my
duty
there
may
be
a
higher
duty
perhaps
but
that
is
mine
i
owe
life
and
canada
that
and
i
got
to
pay
it
rilla
tonight
for
the
first
time
since
jem
left
i
got
back
my
i
could
write
poetry
walter
laughed
i
never
been
able
to
write
a
line
since
last
august
tonight
i
full
of
it
little
sister
be
brave
you
were
so
plucky
when
jem
went
this
is
different
rilla
had
to
stop
after
every
word
to
fight
down
a
wild
outburst
of
sobs
i
loved
jem
of
course
but
when
he
went
away
we
thought
the
war
would
soon
be
over
and
you
are
everything
to
me
walter
you
must
be
brave
to
help
me
i
exalted
tonight
drunk
with
the
excitement
of
victory
over
myself
but
there
will
be
other
times
when
it
wo
be
like
this
i
need
your
help
then
when
do
you
go
she
must
know
the
worst
at
once
not
for
a
week
then
we
go
to
kingsport
for
training
i
suppose
go
overseas
about
the
middle
of
july
we
do
know
one
week
only
one
week
more
with
walter
the
eyes
of
youth
did
not
see
how
she
was
to
go
on
living
when
they
turned
in
at
the
ingleside
gate
walter
stopped
in
the
shadows
of
the
old
pines
and
drew
rilla
close
to
him
there
were
girls
as
sweet
and
pure
as
you
in
belgium
and
flanders
you
even
you
know
what
their
fate
was
we
must
make
it
impossible
for
such
things
to
happen
again
while
the
world
lasts
you
help
me
wo
you
i
try
walter
she
said
oh
i
will
try
as
she
clung
to
him
with
her
face
pressed
against
his
shoulder
she
knew
that
it
had
to
be
she
accepted
the
fact
then
and
there
he
must
go
her
beautiful
walter
with
his
beautiful
soul
and
dreams
and
ideals
and
she
had
known
all
along
that
it
would
come
sooner
or
later
she
had
seen
it
coming
to
her
coming
coming
as
one
sees
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
drawing
near
over
a
sunny
field
swiftly
and
inescapably
amid
all
her
pain
she
was
conscious
of
an
odd
feeling
of
relief
in
some
hidden
part
of
her
soul
where
a
little
dull
unacknowledged
soreness
had
been
lurking
all
winter
no
one
no
one
could
ever
call
walter
a
slacker
now
rilla
did
not
sleep
that
night
perhaps
no
one
at
ingleside
did
except
jims
the
body
grows
slowly
and
steadily
but
the
soul
grows
by
leaps
and
bounds
it
may
come
to
its
full
stature
in
an
hour
from
that
night
rilla
blythe
soul
was
the
soul
of
a
woman
in
its
capacity
for
suffering
for
strength
for
endurance
when
the
bitter
dawn
came
she
rose
and
went
to
her
window
below
her
was
a
big
a
great
swelling
cone
of
rosy
blossom
walter
had
planted
it
years
ago
when
he
was
a
little
boy
beyond
rainbow
valley
there
was
a
cloudy
shore
of
morning
with
little
ripples
of
sunrise
breaking
over
it
the
far
cold
beauty
of
a
lingering
star
shone
above
it
why
in
this
world
of
springtime
loveliness
must
hearts
break
rilla
felt
arms
go
about
her
lovingly
protectingly
it
was
mother
pale
mother
oh
mother
how
can
you
bear
it
she
cried
wildly
rilla
dear
known
for
several
days
that
walter
meant
to
go
i
had
time
to
to
rebel
and
grow
reconciled
we
must
give
him
up
there
is
a
call
greater
and
more
insistent
than
the
call
of
our
love
he
has
listened
to
it
we
must
not
add
to
the
bitterness
of
his
sacrifice
our
sacrifice
is
greater
than
his
cried
rilla
passionately
our
boys
give
only
themselves
we
give
them
before
blythe
could
reply
susan
stuck
her
head
in
at
the
door
never
troubling
over
such
frills
of
etiquette
as
knocking
her
eyes
were
suspiciously
red
but
all
she
said
was
will
i
bring
up
your
breakfast
dr
dear
no
no
susan
we
will
all
be
down
presently
do
you
know
that
walter
has
joined
up
yes
dear
the
doctor
told
me
last
night
i
suppose
the
almighty
has
his
own
reasons
for
allowing
such
things
we
must
submit
and
endeavour
to
look
on
the
bright
side
it
may
cure
him
of
being
a
poet
at
least
susan
still
persisted
in
thinking
that
poets
and
tramps
were
tarred
with
the
same
brush
and
that
would
be
something
but
thank
god
she
muttered
in
a
lower
tone
that
shirley
is
not
old
enough
to
go
is
that
the
same
thing
as
thanking
him
that
some
other
woman
son
has
to
go
in
shirley
place
asked
the
doctor
pausing
on
the
threshold
no
it
is
not
doctor
dear
said
susan
defiantly
as
she
picked
up
jims
who
was
opening
his
big
dark
eyes
and
stretching
up
his
dimpled
paws
do
not
you
put
words
in
my
mouth
that
i
would
never
dream
of
uttering
i
am
a
plain
woman
and
can
not
argue
with
you
but
i
do
not
thank
god
that
anybody
has
to
go
i
only
know
that
it
seems
they
do
have
to
go
unless
we
all
want
to
be
kaiserised
for
i
can
assure
you
that
the
monroe
doctrine
whatever
it
is
is
nothing
to
tie
to
with
woodrow
wilson
behind
it
the
huns
dear
will
never
be
brought
to
book
by
notes
and
now
concluded
susan
tucking
jims
in
the
crook
of
her
gaunt
arms
and
marching
downstairs
having
cried
my
cry
and
said
my
say
i
shall
take
a
brace
and
if
i
can
not
look
pleasant
i
will
look
as
pleasant
as
i
can
chapter
xv
until
the
day
break
the
germans
have
recaptured
premysl
said
susan
despairingly
looking
up
from
her
newspaper
and
now
i
suppose
we
will
have
to
begin
calling
it
by
that
uncivilised
name
again
cousin
sophia
was
in
when
the
mail
came
and
when
she
heard
the
news
she
hove
a
sigh
up
from
the
depths
of
her
stomach
dear
and
said
yes
and
they
will
get
petrograd
next
i
have
no
doubt
i
said
to
her
knowledge
of
geography
is
not
so
profound
as
i
wish
it
was
but
i
have
an
idea
that
it
is
quite
a
walk
from
premysl
to
petrograd
cousin
sophia
sighed
again
and
said
grand
duke
nicholas
is
not
the
man
i
took
him
to
be
not
let
him
know
that
said
i
might
hurt
his
feelings
and
he
has
likely
enough
to
worry
him
as
it
is
but
you
can
not
cheer
cousin
sophia
up
no
matter
how
sarcastic
you
are
dear
she
sighed
for
the
third
time
and
groaned
out
the
russians
are
retreating
fast
and
i
said
what
of
it
they
have
plenty
of
room
for
retreating
have
they
not
but
all
the
same
dear
though
i
would
never
admit
it
to
cousin
sophia
i
do
not
like
the
situation
on
the
eastern
front
nobody
else
liked
it
either
but
all
summer
the
russian
retreat
went
on
a
agony
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
again
be
able
to
await
the
coming
of
the
mail
with
feelings
of
composure
never
to
speak
of
pleasure
said
gertrude
oliver
the
thought
that
haunts
me
night
and
day
is
will
the
germans
smash
russia
completely
and
then
hurl
their
eastern
army
flushed
with
victory
against
the
western
front
they
will
not
miss
oliver
dear
said
susan
assuming
the
role
of
prophetess
in
the
first
place
the
almighty
will
not
allow
it
in
the
second
grand
duke
nicholas
though
he
may
have
been
a
disappointment
to
us
in
some
respects
knows
how
to
run
away
decently
and
in
order
and
that
is
a
very
useful
knowledge
when
germans
are
chasing
you
norman
douglas
declares
he
is
just
luring
them
on
and
killing
ten
of
them
to
one
he
loses
but
i
am
of
the
opinion
he
can
not
help
himself
and
is
just
doing
the
best
he
can
under
the
circumstances
the
same
as
the
rest
of
us
so
do
not
go
so
far
afield
to
borrow
trouble
miss
oliver
dear
when
there
is
plenty
of
it
already
camping
on
our
very
doorstep
walter
had
gone
to
kingsport
the
first
of
june
nan
di
and
faith
had
gone
also
to
do
red
cross
work
in
their
vacation
in
walter
came
home
for
a
week
leave
before
going
overseas
rilla
had
lived
through
the
days
of
his
absence
on
the
hope
of
that
week
and
now
that
it
had
come
she
drank
every
minute
of
it
thirstily
hating
even
the
hours
she
had
to
spend
in
sleep
they
seemed
such
a
waste
of
precious
moments
in
spite
of
its
sadness
it
was
a
beautiful
week
full
of
poignant
unforgettable
hours
when
she
and
walter
had
long
walks
and
talks
and
silences
together
he
was
all
her
own
and
she
knew
that
he
found
strength
and
comfort
in
her
sympathy
and
understanding
it
was
very
wonderful
to
know
she
meant
so
much
to
him
the
knowledge
helped
her
through
moments
that
would
otherwise
have
been
unendurable
and
gave
her
power
to
smile
and
even
to
laugh
a
little
when
walter
had
gone
she
might
indulge
in
the
comfort
of
tears
but
not
while
he
was
here
she
would
not
even
let
herself
cry
at
night
lest
her
eyes
should
betray
her
to
him
in
the
morning
on
his
last
evening
at
home
they
went
together
to
rainbow
valley
and
sat
down
on
the
bank
of
the
brook
under
the
white
lady
where
the
gay
revels
of
olden
days
had
been
held
in
the
cloudless
years
rainbow
valley
was
roofed
over
with
a
sunset
of
unusual
splendour
that
night
a
wonderful
grey
dusk
just
touched
with
starlight
followed
it
and
then
came
moonshine
hinting
hiding
revealing
lighting
up
little
dells
and
hollows
here
leaving
others
in
dark
velvet
shadow
when
i
am
in
france
said
walter
looking
around
him
with
eager
eyes
on
all
the
beauty
his
soul
loved
i
shall
remember
these
still
dewy
places
the
balsam
of
the
the
peace
of
those
white
pools
of
moonshine
the
of
the
hills
what
a
beautiful
old
biblical
phrase
that
is
rilla
look
at
those
old
hills
around
us
the
hills
we
looked
up
at
as
children
wondering
what
lay
for
us
in
the
great
world
beyond
them
how
calm
and
strong
they
are
how
patient
and
changeless
like
the
heart
of
a
good
woman
do
you
know
what
you
have
been
to
me
the
past
year
i
want
to
tell
you
before
i
go
i
could
not
have
lived
through
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
little
loving
believing
heart
rilla
dared
not
try
to
speak
she
slipped
her
hand
into
walter
and
pressed
it
hard
and
when
i
over
there
rilla
in
that
hell
upon
earth
which
men
who
have
forgotten
god
have
made
it
will
be
the
thought
of
you
that
will
help
me
most
i
know
you
be
as
plucky
and
patient
as
you
have
shown
yourself
to
be
this
past
year
i
not
afraid
for
you
i
know
that
no
matter
what
happens
you
be
no
matter
what
happens
rilla
repressed
tear
and
sigh
but
she
could
not
repress
a
little
shiver
and
walter
knew
that
he
had
said
enough
after
a
moment
of
silence
in
which
each
made
an
unworded
promise
to
each
other
he
said
now
we
wo
be
sober
any
more
we
look
beyond
the
years
to
the
time
when
the
war
will
be
over
and
jem
and
jerry
and
i
will
come
marching
home
and
we
all
be
happy
again
we
wo
be
happy
in
the
same
way
said
rilla
no
not
in
the
same
way
nobody
whom
this
war
has
touched
will
ever
be
happy
again
in
quite
the
same
way
but
it
will
be
a
better
happiness
i
think
little
sister
a
happiness
we
earned
we
were
very
happy
before
the
war
were
we
with
a
home
like
ingleside
and
a
father
and
mother
like
ours
we
could
help
being
happy
but
that
happiness
was
a
gift
from
life
and
love
it
was
really
ours
life
could
take
it
back
at
any
time
it
can
never
take
away
the
happiness
we
win
for
ourselves
in
the
way
of
duty
i
realised
that
since
i
went
into
khaki
in
spite
of
my
occasional
funks
when
i
fall
to
living
over
things
beforehand
i
been
happy
since
that
night
in
may
rilla
be
awfully
good
to
mother
while
i
away
it
must
be
a
horrible
thing
to
be
a
mother
in
this
war
the
mothers
and
sisters
and
wives
and
sweethearts
have
the
hardest
times
rilla
you
beautiful
little
thing
are
you
anybody
sweetheart
if
you
are
tell
me
before
i
go
no
said
rilla
then
impelled
by
a
wish
to
be
absolutely
frank
with
walter
in
this
talk
that
might
be
the
last
they
would
ever
have
she
added
blushing
wildly
in
the
moonlight
but
if
kenneth
ford
wanted
me
to
be
i
see
said
walter
and
ken
in
khaki
too
poor
little
girlie
it
a
bit
hard
for
you
all
round
well
i
not
leaving
any
girl
to
break
her
heart
about
me
thank
god
for
that
rilla
glanced
up
at
the
manse
on
the
hill
she
could
see
a
light
in
una
meredith
window
she
felt
tempted
to
say
something
then
she
knew
she
must
not
it
was
not
her
secret
and
anyway
she
did
not
know
she
only
suspected
walter
looked
about
him
lingeringly
and
lovingly
this
spot
had
always
been
so
dear
to
him
what
fun
they
all
had
had
here
lang
syne
phantoms
of
memory
seemed
to
pace
the
dappled
paths
and
peep
merrily
through
the
swinging
boughs
jem
and
jerry
sunburned
schoolboys
fishing
in
the
brook
and
frying
trout
over
the
old
stone
fireplace
nan
and
di
and
faith
in
their
dimpled
childish
beauty
una
the
sweet
and
shy
carl
poring
over
ants
and
bugs
little
slangy
mary
vance
the
old
walter
that
had
been
himself
lying
on
the
grass
reading
poetry
or
wandering
through
palaces
of
fancy
they
were
all
there
around
him
he
could
see
them
almost
as
plainly
as
he
saw
rilla
as
plainly
as
he
had
once
seen
the
pied
piper
piping
down
the
valley
in
a
vanished
twilight
and
they
said
to
him
those
gay
little
ghosts
of
other
days
we
were
the
children
of
yesterday
walter
fight
a
good
fight
for
the
children
of
and
where
are
you
walter
cried
rilla
laughing
a
little
come
back
come
back
walter
came
back
with
a
long
breath
he
stood
up
and
looked
about
him
at
the
beautiful
valley
of
moonlight
as
if
to
impress
on
his
mind
and
heart
every
charm
it
possessed
the
great
dark
plumes
of
the
firs
against
the
silvery
sky
the
stately
white
lady
the
old
magic
of
the
dancing
brook
the
faithful
tree
lovers
the
beckoning
tricksy
paths
i
shall
see
it
so
in
my
dreams
he
said
as
he
turned
away
they
went
back
to
ingleside
and
meredith
were
there
with
gertrude
oliver
who
had
come
from
lowbridge
to
say
everybody
was
quite
cheerful
and
bright
but
nobody
said
much
about
the
war
being
soon
over
as
they
had
said
when
jem
went
away
they
did
not
talk
about
the
war
at
all
and
they
thought
of
nothing
else
at
last
they
gathered
around
the
piano
and
sang
the
grand
old
hymn
oh
god
our
help
in
ages
past
our
hope
for
years
to
come
our
shelter
from
the
stormy
blast
and
our
eternal
home
we
all
come
back
to
god
in
these
days
of
said
gertrude
to
john
meredith
there
have
been
many
days
in
the
past
when
i
believe
in
god
not
as
god
only
as
the
impersonal
great
first
cause
of
the
scientists
i
believe
in
him
now
i
have
to
there
nothing
else
to
fall
back
on
but
god
humbly
starkly
unconditionally
help
in
ages
past
same
yesterday
and
for
ever
said
the
minister
gently
when
we
forget
god
he
remembers
us
there
was
no
crowd
at
the
glen
station
the
next
morning
to
see
walter
off
it
was
becoming
a
commonplace
for
a
khaki
clad
boy
to
board
that
early
morning
train
after
his
last
leave
besides
his
own
only
the
manse
folk
were
there
and
mary
vance
mary
had
sent
her
miller
off
the
week
before
with
a
determined
grin
and
now
considered
herself
entitled
to
give
expert
opinion
on
how
such
partings
should
be
conducted
the
main
thing
is
to
smile
and
act
as
if
nothing
was
happening
she
informed
the
ingleside
group
the
boys
all
hate
the
sob
act
like
poison
miller
told
me
i
was
to
come
near
the
station
if
i
keep
from
bawling
so
i
got
through
with
my
crying
beforehand
and
at
the
last
i
said
to
him
luck
miller
and
if
you
come
back
find
i
have
changed
any
and
if
you
do
come
back
i
always
be
proud
you
went
and
in
any
case
do
fall
in
love
with
a
french
girl
miller
swore
he
would
but
you
never
can
tell
about
those
fascinating
foreign
hussies
anyhow
the
last
sight
he
had
of
me
i
was
smiling
to
my
limit
gee
all
the
rest
of
the
day
my
face
felt
as
if
it
had
been
starched
and
ironed
into
a
smile
in
spite
of
mary
advice
and
example
blythe
who
had
sent
jem
off
with
a
smile
could
not
quite
manage
one
for
walter
but
at
least
no
one
cried
dog
monday
came
out
of
his
lair
in
the
and
sat
down
close
to
walter
thumping
his
tail
vigorously
on
the
boards
of
the
platform
whenever
walter
spoke
to
him
and
looking
up
with
confident
eyes
as
if
to
say
i
know
you
find
jem
and
bring
him
back
to
me
so
long
old
fellow
said
carl
meredith
cheerfully
when
the
had
to
be
said
tell
them
over
there
to
keep
their
spirits
up
i
am
coming
along
presently
me
too
said
shirley
laconically
proffering
a
brown
paw
susan
heard
him
and
her
face
turned
very
grey
una
shook
hands
quietly
looking
at
him
with
wistful
sorrowful
eyes
but
then
una
eyes
had
always
been
wistful
walter
bent
his
handsome
black
head
in
its
khaki
cap
and
kissed
her
with
the
warm
comradely
kiss
of
a
brother
he
had
never
kissed
her
before
and
for
a
fleeting
moment
una
face
betrayed
her
if
anyone
had
noticed
but
nobody
did
the
conductor
was
shouting
all
aboard
everybody
was
trying
to
look
very
cheerful
walter
turned
to
rilla
she
held
his
hands
and
looked
up
at
him
she
would
not
see
him
again
until
the
day
broke
and
the
shadows
vanished
and
she
knew
not
if
that
daybreak
would
be
on
this
side
of
the
grave
or
beyond
it
she
said
on
her
lips
it
lost
all
the
bitterness
it
had
won
through
the
ages
of
parting
and
bore
instead
all
the
sweetness
of
the
old
loves
of
all
the
women
who
had
ever
loved
and
prayed
for
the
beloved
write
me
often
and
bring
jims
up
faithfully
according
to
the
gospel
of
morgan
walter
said
lightly
having
said
all
his
serious
things
the
night
before
in
rainbow
valley
but
at
the
last
moment
he
took
her
face
between
his
hands
and
looked
deep
into
her
gallant
eyes
god
bless
you
he
said
softly
and
tenderly
after
all
it
was
not
a
hard
thing
to
fight
for
a
land
that
bore
daughters
like
this
he
stood
on
the
rear
platform
and
waved
to
them
as
the
train
pulled
out
rilla
was
standing
by
herself
but
una
meredith
came
to
her
and
the
two
girls
who
loved
him
most
stood
together
and
held
each
cold
hands
as
the
train
rounded
the
curve
of
the
wooded
hill
rilla
spent
an
hour
in
rainbow
valley
that
morning
about
which
she
never
said
a
word
to
anyone
she
did
not
even
write
in
her
diary
about
it
when
it
was
over
she
went
home
and
made
rompers
for
jims
in
the
evening
she
went
to
a
junior
red
cross
committee
meeting
and
was
severely
businesslike
you
would
never
suppose
said
irene
howard
to
olive
kirk
afterwards
that
walter
had
left
for
the
front
only
this
morning
but
some
people
really
have
no
depth
of
feeling
i
often
wish
i
could
take
things
as
lightly
as
rilla
blythe
chapter
xvi
realism
and
romance
warsaw
has
fallen
said
blythe
with
a
resigned
air
as
he
brought
the
mail
in
one
warm
august
day
gertrude
and
blythe
looked
dismally
at
each
other
and
rilla
who
was
feeding
jims
a
morganized
diet
from
a
carefully
sterilized
spoon
laid
the
said
spoon
down
on
his
tray
utterly
regardless
of
germs
and
said
oh
dear
me
in
as
tragic
a
tone
as
if
the
news
had
come
as
a
thunderbolt
instead
of
being
a
foregone
conclusion
from
the
preceding
week
dispatches
they
had
thought
they
were
quite
resigned
to
warsaw
fall
but
now
they
knew
they
had
as
always
hoped
against
hope
now
let
us
take
a
brace
said
susan
it
is
not
the
terrible
thing
we
have
been
thinking
i
read
a
dispatch
three
columns
long
in
the
montreal
herald
yesterday
that
proved
that
warsaw
was
not
important
from
a
military
point
of
view
at
all
so
let
us
take
the
military
point
of
view
doctor
dear
i
read
that
dispatch
too
and
it
has
encouraged
me
immensely
said
gertrude
i
knew
then
and
i
know
now
that
it
was
a
lie
from
beginning
to
end
but
i
am
in
that
state
of
mind
where
even
a
lie
is
a
comfort
providing
it
is
a
cheerful
lie
in
that
case
miss
oliver
dear
the
german
official
reports
ought
to
be
all
you
need
said
susan
sarcastically
i
never
read
them
now
because
they
make
me
so
mad
i
can
not
put
my
thoughts
properly
on
my
work
after
a
dose
of
them
even
this
news
about
warsaw
has
taken
the
edge
off
my
afternoon
plans
misfortunes
never
come
singly
i
spoiled
my
baking
of
bread
today
and
now
warsaw
has
fallen
and
here
is
little
kitchener
bent
on
choking
himself
to
death
jims
was
evidently
trying
to
swallow
his
spoon
germs
and
all
rilla
rescued
him
mechanically
and
was
about
to
resume
the
operation
of
feeding
him
when
a
casual
remark
of
her
father
sent
such
a
shock
and
thrill
over
her
that
for
the
second
time
she
dropped
that
doomed
spoon
kenneth
ford
is
down
at
martin
west
the
doctor
was
saying
his
regiment
was
on
its
way
to
the
front
but
was
held
up
in
kingsport
for
some
reason
and
ken
got
leave
of
absence
to
come
over
to
the
island
i
hope
he
will
come
up
to
see
us
exclaimed
blythe
he
only
has
a
day
or
two
off
i
believe
said
the
doctor
absently
nobody
noticed
rilla
flushed
face
and
trembling
hands
even
the
most
thoughtful
and
watchful
of
parents
do
not
see
everything
that
goes
on
under
their
very
noses
rilla
made
a
third
attempt
to
give
the
jims
his
dinner
but
all
she
could
think
of
was
the
question
would
ken
come
to
see
her
before
he
went
away
she
had
not
heard
from
him
for
a
long
while
had
he
forgotten
her
completely
if
he
did
not
come
she
would
know
that
he
had
perhaps
there
was
even
some
other
girl
back
there
in
toronto
of
course
there
was
she
was
a
little
fool
to
be
thinking
about
him
at
all
she
would
not
think
about
him
if
he
came
well
and
good
it
would
only
be
courteous
of
him
to
make
a
farewell
call
at
ingleside
where
he
had
often
been
a
guest
if
he
did
not
come
well
and
good
too
it
did
not
matter
very
much
nobody
was
going
to
fret
that
was
all
settled
comfortably
she
was
quite
indifferent
but
meanwhile
jims
was
being
fed
with
a
haste
and
recklessness
that
would
have
filled
the
soul
of
morgan
with
horror
jims
himself
did
like
it
being
a
methodical
baby
accustomed
to
swallowing
spoonfuls
with
a
decent
interval
for
breath
between
each
he
protested
but
his
protests
availed
him
nothing
rilla
as
far
as
the
care
and
feeding
of
infants
was
concerned
was
utterly
demoralized
then
the
rang
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
the
telephone
ringing
it
rang
on
an
average
every
ten
minutes
at
ingleside
but
rilla
dropped
jims
spoon
again
on
the
carpet
this
time
and
flew
to
the
as
if
life
depended
on
her
getting
there
before
anybody
else
jims
his
patience
exhausted
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
hello
is
this
ingleside
yes
that
you
rilla
yeth
yeth
oh
why
could
jims
stop
howling
for
just
one
little
minute
why
did
somebody
come
in
and
choke
him
know
who
speaking
oh
did
she
know
would
she
know
that
voice
anywhere
at
any
time
it
ken
is
it
sure
thing
i
here
for
a
can
i
come
up
to
ingleside
tonight
and
see
you
of
courthe
had
he
used
you
in
the
singular
or
plural
sense
presently
she
would
wring
jims
neck
oh
what
was
ken
saying
see
here
rilla
can
you
arrange
that
there
wo
be
more
than
a
few
dozen
people
round
understand
i
ca
make
my
meaning
clearer
over
this
bally
rural
line
there
are
a
dozen
receivers
down
did
she
understand
yes
she
understood
i
try
she
said
i
be
up
about
eight
then
rilla
hung
up
the
and
flew
to
jims
but
she
did
not
wring
that
injured
infant
neck
instead
she
snatched
him
bodily
out
of
his
chair
crushed
him
against
her
face
kissed
him
rapturously
on
his
milky
mouth
and
danced
wildly
around
the
room
with
him
in
her
arms
after
this
jims
was
relieved
to
find
that
she
returned
to
sanity
gave
him
the
rest
of
his
dinner
properly
and
tucked
him
away
for
his
afternoon
nap
with
the
little
lullaby
he
loved
best
of
all
she
sewed
at
red
cross
shirts
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
and
built
a
crystal
castle
of
dreams
all
with
rainbows
ken
wanted
to
see
her
to
see
her
alone
that
could
be
easily
managed
shirley
would
bother
them
father
and
mother
were
going
to
the
manse
miss
oliver
never
played
gooseberry
and
jims
always
slept
the
clock
round
from
seven
to
seven
she
would
entertain
ken
on
the
veranda
it
would
be
moonlight
she
would
wear
her
white
georgette
dress
and
do
her
hair
up
yes
she
would
at
least
in
a
low
knot
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
mother
could
object
to
that
surely
oh
how
wonderful
and
romantic
it
would
be
would
ken
say
anything
he
must
mean
to
say
something
or
why
should
he
be
so
particular
about
seeing
her
alone
what
if
it
rained
susan
had
been
complaining
about
hyde
that
morning
what
if
some
officious
junior
red
called
to
discuss
belgians
and
shirts
or
worst
of
all
what
if
fred
arnold
dropped
in
he
did
occasionally
the
evening
came
at
last
and
was
all
that
could
be
desired
in
an
evening
the
doctor
and
his
wife
went
to
the
manse
shirley
and
miss
oliver
went
they
alone
knew
where
susan
went
to
the
store
for
household
supplies
and
jims
went
to
dreamland
rilla
put
on
her
georgette
gown
knotted
up
her
hair
and
bound
a
little
double
string
of
pearls
around
it
then
she
tucked
a
cluster
of
pale
pink
baby
roses
at
her
belt
would
ken
ask
her
for
a
rose
for
a
keepsake
she
knew
that
jem
had
carried
to
the
trenches
in
flanders
a
faded
rose
that
faith
meredith
had
kissed
and
given
him
the
night
before
he
left
rilla
looked
very
sweet
when
she
met
ken
in
the
mingled
moonlight
and
vine
shadows
of
the
big
veranda
the
hand
she
gave
him
was
cold
and
she
was
so
desperately
anxious
not
to
lisp
that
her
greeting
was
prim
and
precise
how
handsome
and
tall
kenneth
looked
in
his
uniform
it
made
him
seem
older
too
so
much
so
that
rilla
felt
rather
foolish
had
it
been
the
height
of
absurdity
for
her
to
suppose
that
this
splendid
young
officer
had
anything
special
to
say
to
her
little
rilla
blythe
of
glen
mary
likely
she
had
understood
him
after
all
he
had
only
meant
that
he
did
want
a
mob
of
folks
around
making
a
fuss
over
him
and
trying
to
lionize
him
as
they
had
probably
done
yes
of
course
that
was
all
he
meant
and
she
little
idiot
had
gone
and
vainly
imagined
that
he
did
want
anybody
but
her
and
he
would
think
she
had
manoeuvred
everybody
away
so
that
they
could
be
alone
together
and
he
would
laugh
to
himself
at
her
this
is
better
luck
than
i
hoped
for
said
ken
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
at
her
with
very
unconcealed
admiration
in
his
eloquent
eyes
i
was
sure
someone
would
be
hanging
about
and
it
was
just
you
i
wanted
to
see
rilla
dream
castle
flashed
into
the
landscape
again
this
was
unmistakable
enough
certainly
not
much
doubt
as
to
his
meaning
here
there
are
so
many
of
us
to
poke
around
as
there
used
to
be
she
said
softly
no
that
so
said
ken
gently
jem
and
walter
and
the
girls
away
it
makes
a
big
blank
does
it
but
he
leaned
forward
until
his
dark
curls
almost
brushed
her
hair
does
fred
arnold
try
to
fill
the
blank
occasionally
i
been
told
so
at
this
moment
before
rilla
could
make
any
reply
jims
began
to
cry
at
the
top
of
his
voice
in
the
room
whose
open
window
was
just
above
them
jims
who
hardly
ever
cried
in
the
evening
moreover
he
was
crying
as
rilla
knew
from
experience
with
a
vim
and
energy
that
betokened
that
he
had
been
already
whimpering
softly
unheard
for
some
time
and
was
thoroughly
exasperated
when
jims
started
in
crying
like
that
he
made
a
thorough
job
of
it
rilla
knew
that
there
was
no
use
to
sit
still
and
pretend
to
ignore
him
he
would
stop
and
conversation
of
any
kind
was
out
of
the
question
when
such
shrieks
and
howls
were
floating
over
your
head
besides
she
was
afraid
kenneth
would
think
she
was
utterly
unfeeling
if
she
sat
still
and
let
a
baby
cry
like
that
he
was
not
likely
acquainted
with
morgan
invaluable
volume
she
got
up
jims
has
had
a
nightmare
i
think
he
sometimes
has
one
and
he
is
always
badly
frightened
by
it
excuse
me
for
a
moment
rilla
flew
upstairs
wishing
quite
frankly
that
soup
tureens
had
never
been
invented
but
when
jims
at
sight
of
her
lifted
his
little
arms
entreatingly
and
swallowed
several
sobs
with
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
resentment
went
out
of
her
heart
after
all
the
poor
darling
was
frightened
she
picked
him
up
gently
and
rocked
him
soothingly
until
his
sobs
ceased
and
his
eyes
closed
then
she
essayed
to
lay
him
down
in
his
crib
jims
opened
his
eyes
and
shrieked
a
protest
this
performance
was
repeated
twice
rilla
grew
desperate
she
leave
ken
down
there
alone
any
longer
she
had
been
away
nearly
half
an
hour
already
with
a
resigned
air
she
marched
downstairs
carrying
jims
and
sat
down
on
the
veranda
it
was
no
doubt
a
ridiculous
thing
to
sit
and
cuddle
a
contrary
when
your
best
young
man
was
making
his
farewell
call
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
jims
was
supremely
happy
he
kicked
his
little
feet
rapturously
out
under
his
white
nighty
and
gave
one
of
his
rare
laughs
he
was
beginning
to
be
a
very
pretty
baby
his
golden
hair
curled
in
silken
ringlets
all
over
his
little
round
head
and
his
eyes
were
beautiful
he
a
decorative
kiddy
all
right
is
he
said
ken
his
looks
are
very
well
said
rilla
bitterly
as
if
to
imply
that
they
were
much
the
best
of
him
jims
being
an
astute
infant
sensed
trouble
in
the
atmosphere
and
realized
that
it
was
up
to
him
to
clear
it
away
he
turned
his
face
up
to
rilla
smiled
adorably
and
said
clearly
and
beguilingly
will
will
it
was
the
very
first
time
he
had
spoken
a
word
or
tried
to
speak
rilla
was
so
delighted
that
she
forgot
her
grudge
against
him
she
forgave
him
with
a
hug
and
kiss
jims
understanding
that
he
was
restored
to
favour
cuddled
down
against
her
just
where
a
gleam
of
light
from
the
lamp
in
the
struck
across
his
hair
and
turned
it
into
a
halo
of
gold
against
her
breast
kenneth
sat
very
still
and
silent
looking
at
rilla
at
the
delicate
girlish
silhouette
of
her
her
long
lashes
her
dented
lip
her
adorable
chin
in
the
dim
moonlight
as
she
sat
with
her
head
bent
a
little
over
jims
the
lamplight
glinting
on
her
pearls
until
they
glistened
like
a
slender
nimbus
he
thought
she
looked
exactly
like
the
madonna
that
hung
over
his
mother
desk
at
home
he
carried
that
picture
of
her
in
his
heart
to
the
horror
of
the
battlefields
of
france
he
had
had
a
strong
fancy
for
rilla
blythe
ever
since
the
night
of
the
four
winds
dance
but
it
was
when
he
saw
her
there
with
little
jims
in
her
arms
that
he
loved
her
and
realized
it
and
all
the
while
poor
rilla
was
sitting
disappointed
and
humiliated
feeling
that
her
last
evening
with
ken
was
spoiled
and
wondering
why
things
always
had
to
go
so
contrarily
outside
of
books
she
felt
too
absurd
to
try
to
talk
evidently
ken
was
completely
disgusted
too
since
he
was
sitting
there
in
such
stony
silence
hope
revived
momentarily
when
jims
went
so
thoroughly
asleep
that
she
thought
it
would
be
safe
to
lay
him
down
on
the
couch
in
the
but
when
she
came
out
again
susan
was
sitting
on
the
veranda
loosening
her
bonnet
strings
with
the
air
of
one
who
meant
to
stay
where
she
was
for
some
time
have
you
got
your
baby
to
sleep
she
asked
kindly
your
baby
really
susan
might
have
more
tact
yes
said
rilla
shortly
susan
laid
her
parcels
on
the
reed
table
as
one
determined
to
do
her
duty
she
was
very
tired
but
she
must
help
rilla
out
here
was
kenneth
ford
who
had
come
to
call
on
the
family
and
they
were
all
unfortunately
out
and
the
poor
child
had
had
to
entertain
him
alone
but
susan
had
come
to
her
rescue
susan
would
do
her
part
no
matter
how
tired
she
was
dear
me
how
you
have
grown
up
she
said
looking
at
ken
six
feet
of
khaki
uniform
without
the
least
awe
susan
had
grown
used
to
khaki
now
and
at
even
a
lieutenant
uniform
is
just
clothes
and
nothing
else
it
is
an
amazing
thing
how
fast
children
do
grow
up
rilla
here
now
is
almost
fifteen
i
going
on
seventeen
susan
cried
rilla
almost
passionately
she
was
a
whole
month
past
sixteen
it
was
intolerable
of
susan
it
seems
just
the
other
day
that
you
were
all
babies
said
susan
ignoring
rilla
protest
you
were
really
the
prettiest
baby
i
ever
saw
ken
though
your
mother
had
an
awful
time
trying
to
cure
you
of
sucking
your
thumb
do
you
remember
the
day
i
spanked
you
no
said
ken
oh
well
i
suppose
you
would
be
too
young
you
were
only
about
four
and
you
were
here
with
your
mother
and
you
insisted
on
teasing
nan
until
she
cried
i
had
tried
several
ways
of
stopping
you
but
none
availed
and
i
saw
that
a
spanking
was
the
only
thing
that
would
serve
so
i
picked
you
up
and
laid
you
across
my
knee
and
lambasted
you
well
you
howled
at
the
top
of
your
voice
but
you
left
nan
alone
after
that
rilla
was
writhing
had
susan
any
realization
that
she
was
addressing
an
officer
of
the
canadian
army
apparently
she
had
not
oh
what
would
ken
think
i
suppose
you
do
not
remember
the
time
your
mother
spanked
you
either
continued
susan
who
seemed
to
be
bent
on
reviving
tender
reminiscences
that
evening
i
shall
never
no
never
forget
it
she
was
up
here
one
night
with
you
when
you
were
about
three
and
you
and
walter
were
playing
out
in
the
kitchen
yard
with
a
kitten
i
had
a
big
puncheon
of
rainwater
by
the
spout
which
i
was
reserving
for
making
soap
and
you
and
walter
began
quarrelling
over
the
kitten
walter
was
at
one
side
of
the
puncheon
standing
on
a
chair
holding
the
kitten
and
you
were
standing
on
a
chair
at
the
other
side
you
leaned
across
that
puncheon
and
grabbed
the
kitten
and
pulled
you
were
always
a
great
hand
for
taking
what
you
wanted
without
too
much
ceremony
walter
held
on
tight
and
the
poor
kitten
yelled
but
you
dragged
walter
and
the
kitten
half
over
and
then
you
both
lost
your
balance
and
tumbled
into
that
puncheon
kitten
and
all
if
i
had
not
been
on
the
spot
you
would
both
have
been
drowned
i
flew
to
the
rescue
and
hauled
you
all
three
out
before
much
harm
was
done
and
your
mother
who
had
seen
it
all
from
the
upstairs
window
came
down
and
picked
you
up
dripping
as
you
were
and
gave
you
a
beautiful
spanking
ah
said
susan
with
a
sigh
those
were
happy
old
days
at
ingleside
must
have
been
said
ken
his
voice
sounded
queer
and
stiff
rilla
supposed
he
was
hopelessly
enraged
the
truth
was
he
dared
not
trust
his
voice
lest
it
betray
his
frantic
desire
to
laugh
rilla
here
now
said
susan
looking
affectionately
at
that
unhappy
damsel
never
was
much
spanked
she
was
a
real
child
for
the
most
part
but
her
father
did
spank
her
once
she
got
two
bottles
of
pills
out
of
his
office
and
dared
alice
clow
to
see
which
of
them
could
swallow
all
the
pills
first
and
if
her
father
had
not
happened
in
the
nick
of
time
those
two
children
would
have
been
corpses
by
night
as
it
was
they
were
both
sick
enough
shortly
after
but
the
doctor
spanked
rilla
then
and
there
and
he
made
such
a
thorough
job
of
it
that
she
never
meddled
with
anything
in
his
office
afterwards
we
hear
a
great
deal
nowadays
of
something
that
is
called
persuasion
but
in
my
opinion
a
good
spanking
and
no
nagging
afterwards
is
a
much
better
thing
rilla
wondered
viciously
whether
susan
meant
to
relate
all
the
family
spankings
but
susan
had
finished
with
the
subject
and
branched
off
to
another
cheerful
one
i
remember
little
tod
macallister
killed
himself
that
very
way
eating
up
a
whole
box
of
fruitatives
because
he
thought
they
were
candy
it
was
a
very
sad
affair
he
was
said
susan
earnestly
the
very
cutest
little
corpse
i
ever
laid
my
eyes
on
it
was
very
careless
of
his
mother
to
leave
the
fruitatives
where
he
could
get
them
but
she
was
to
be
a
heedless
creature
one
day
she
found
a
nest
of
five
eggs
as
she
was
going
across
the
fields
to
church
with
a
brand
new
blue
silk
dress
on
so
she
put
them
in
the
pocket
of
her
petticoat
and
when
she
got
to
church
she
forgot
all
about
them
and
sat
down
on
them
and
her
dress
was
ruined
not
to
speak
of
the
petticoat
let
me
see
would
not
tod
be
some
relation
of
yours
your
great
grandmother
west
was
a
macallister
her
brother
amos
was
a
macdonaldite
in
religion
i
am
told
he
used
to
take
the
jerks
something
fearful
but
you
look
more
like
your
great
grandfather
west
than
the
macallisters
he
died
of
a
paralytic
stroke
quite
early
in
life
did
you
see
anybody
at
the
store
asked
rilla
desperately
in
the
faint
hope
of
directing
susan
conversation
into
more
agreeable
channels
nobody
except
mary
vance
said
susan
and
she
was
stepping
round
as
brisk
as
the
irishman
flea
what
terrible
similes
susan
used
would
kenneth
think
she
acquired
them
from
the
family
to
hear
mary
talk
about
miller
douglas
you
would
think
he
was
the
only
glen
boy
who
had
enlisted
susan
went
on
but
of
course
she
always
did
brag
and
she
has
some
good
qualities
i
am
willing
to
admit
though
i
did
not
think
so
that
time
she
chased
rilla
here
through
the
village
with
a
dried
codfish
till
the
poor
child
fell
heels
over
head
into
the
puddle
before
carter
flagg
store
rilla
went
cold
all
over
with
wrath
and
shame
were
there
any
more
disgraceful
scenes
in
her
past
that
susan
could
rake
up
as
for
ken
he
could
have
howled
over
susan
speeches
but
he
would
not
so
insult
the
duenna
of
his
lady
so
he
sat
with
a
preternaturally
solemn
face
which
seemed
to
poor
rilla
a
haughty
and
offended
one
i
paid
eleven
cents
for
a
bottle
of
ink
tonight
complained
susan
ink
is
twice
as
high
as
it
was
last
year
perhaps
it
is
because
woodrow
wilson
has
been
writing
so
many
notes
it
must
cost
him
considerable
my
cousin
sophia
says
woodrow
wilson
is
not
the
man
she
expected
him
to
be
but
then
no
man
ever
was
being
an
old
maid
i
do
not
know
much
about
men
and
have
never
pretended
to
but
my
cousin
sophia
is
very
hard
on
them
although
she
married
two
of
them
which
you
might
think
was
a
fair
share
albert
crawford
chimney
blew
down
in
that
big
gale
we
had
last
week
and
when
sophia
heard
the
bricks
clattering
on
the
roof
she
thought
it
was
a
zeppelin
raid
and
went
into
hysterics
and
albert
crawford
says
that
of
the
two
things
she
would
have
preferred
the
zeppelin
raid
rilla
sat
limply
in
her
chair
like
one
hypnotized
she
knew
susan
would
stop
talking
when
she
was
ready
to
stop
and
that
no
earthly
power
could
make
her
stop
any
sooner
as
a
rule
she
was
very
fond
of
susan
but
just
now
she
hated
her
with
a
deadly
hatred
it
was
ten
ken
would
soon
have
to
go
the
others
would
soon
be
home
and
she
had
not
even
had
a
chance
to
explain
to
ken
that
fred
arnold
filled
no
blank
in
her
life
nor
ever
could
her
rainbow
castle
lay
in
ruins
round
her
kenneth
got
up
at
last
he
realized
that
susan
was
there
to
stay
as
long
as
he
did
and
it
was
a
three
mile
walk
to
martin
he
wondered
if
rilla
had
put
susan
up
to
this
not
wanting
to
be
left
alone
with
him
lest
he
say
something
fred
sweetheart
did
not
want
to
hear
rilla
got
up
too
and
walked
silently
the
length
of
the
veranda
with
him
they
stood
there
for
a
moment
ken
on
the
lower
step
the
step
was
half
sunk
into
the
earth
and
mint
grew
thickly
about
and
over
its
edge
often
crushed
by
so
many
passing
feet
it
gave
out
its
essence
freely
and
the
spicy
odour
hung
round
them
like
a
soundless
invisible
benediction
ken
looked
up
at
rilla
whose
hair
was
shining
in
the
moonlight
and
whose
eyes
were
pools
of
allurement
all
at
once
he
felt
sure
there
was
nothing
in
that
gossip
about
fred
arnold
rilla
he
said
in
a
sudden
intense
whisper
you
are
the
sweetest
thing
rilla
flushed
and
looked
at
susan
ken
looked
too
and
saw
that
susan
back
was
turned
he
put
his
arm
about
rilla
and
kissed
her
it
was
the
first
time
rilla
had
ever
been
kissed
she
thought
perhaps
she
ought
to
resent
it
but
she
did
instead
she
glanced
timidly
into
kenneth
seeking
eyes
and
her
glance
was
a
kiss
said
ken
will
you
promise
that
you
wo
let
anyone
else
kiss
you
until
i
come
back
yes
said
rilla
trembling
and
thrilling
susan
was
turning
round
ken
loosened
his
hold
and
stepped
to
the
walk
he
said
casually
rilla
heard
herself
saying
it
just
as
casually
she
stood
and
watched
him
down
the
walk
out
of
the
gate
and
down
the
road
when
the
fir
wood
hid
him
from
her
sight
she
suddenly
said
oh
in
a
choked
way
and
ran
down
to
the
gate
sweet
blossomy
things
catching
at
her
skirts
as
she
ran
leaning
over
the
gate
she
saw
kenneth
walking
briskly
down
the
road
over
the
bars
of
tree
shadows
and
moonlight
his
tall
erect
figure
grey
in
the
white
radiance
as
he
reached
the
turn
he
stopped
and
looked
back
and
saw
her
standing
amid
the
tall
white
lilies
by
the
gate
he
waved
his
hand
she
waved
hers
he
was
gone
around
the
turn
rilla
stood
there
for
a
little
while
gazing
across
the
fields
of
mist
and
silver
she
had
heard
her
mother
say
that
she
loved
turns
in
roads
they
were
so
provocative
and
alluring
rilla
thought
she
hated
them
she
had
seen
jem
and
jerry
vanish
from
her
around
a
bend
in
the
road
then
walter
and
now
ken
brothers
and
playmate
and
sweetheart
they
were
all
gone
never
it
might
be
to
return
yet
still
the
piper
piped
and
the
dance
of
death
went
on
when
rilla
walked
slowly
back
to
the
house
susan
was
still
sitting
by
the
veranda
table
and
susan
was
sniffing
suspiciously
i
have
been
thinking
rilla
dear
of
the
old
days
in
the
house
of
dreams
when
kenneth
mother
and
father
were
courting
and
jem
was
a
little
baby
and
you
were
not
born
or
thought
of
it
was
a
very
romantic
affair
and
she
and
your
mother
were
such
chums
to
think
i
should
have
lived
to
see
her
son
going
to
the
front
as
if
she
had
not
had
enough
trouble
in
her
early
life
without
this
coming
upon
her
but
we
must
take
a
brace
and
see
it
through
all
rilla
anger
against
susan
had
evaporated
with
ken
kiss
still
burning
on
her
lips
and
the
wonderful
significance
of
the
promise
he
had
asked
thrilling
heart
and
soul
she
could
not
be
angry
with
anyone
she
put
her
slim
white
hand
into
susan
brown
one
and
gave
it
a
squeeze
susan
was
a
faithful
old
dear
and
would
lay
down
her
life
for
any
one
of
them
you
are
tired
rilla
dear
and
had
better
go
to
bed
susan
said
patting
her
hand
i
noticed
you
were
too
tired
to
talk
tonight
i
am
glad
i
came
home
in
time
to
help
you
out
it
is
very
tiresome
trying
to
entertain
young
men
when
you
are
not
accustomed
to
it
rilla
carried
jims
upstairs
and
went
to
bed
but
not
before
she
had
sat
for
a
long
time
at
her
window
reconstructing
her
rainbow
castle
with
several
added
domes
and
turrets
i
wonder
she
said
to
herself
if
i
am
or
am
not
engaged
to
kenneth
ford
chapter
xvii
the
weeks
wear
by
rilla
read
her
first
love
letter
in
her
rainbow
valley
nook
and
a
girl
first
love
letter
whatever
blase
older
people
may
think
of
it
is
an
event
of
tremendous
importance
in
the
teens
after
kenneth
regiment
had
left
kingsport
there
came
a
fortnight
of
anxiety
and
when
the
congregation
sang
in
church
on
sunday
evenings
oh
hear
us
when
we
cry
to
thee
for
those
in
peril
on
the
sea
rilla
voice
always
failed
her
for
with
the
words
came
a
horribly
vivid
mind
picture
of
a
submarined
ship
sinking
beneath
pitiless
waves
amid
the
struggles
and
cries
of
drowning
men
then
word
came
that
kenneth
regiment
had
arrived
safely
in
england
and
now
at
last
here
was
his
letter
it
began
with
something
that
made
rilla
supremely
happy
for
the
moment
and
ended
with
a
paragraph
that
crimsoned
her
cheeks
with
the
wonder
and
thrill
and
delight
of
it
between
beginning
and
ending
the
letter
was
just
such
a
jolly
newsy
epistle
as
ken
might
have
written
to
anyone
but
for
the
sake
of
that
beginning
and
ending
rilla
slept
with
the
letter
under
her
pillow
for
weeks
sometimes
waking
in
the
night
to
slip
her
fingers
under
and
just
touch
it
and
looked
with
secret
pity
on
other
girls
whose
sweethearts
could
never
have
written
them
anything
half
so
wonderful
and
exquisite
kenneth
was
not
the
son
of
a
famous
novelist
for
nothing
he
had
a
way
of
expressing
things
in
a
few
poignant
significant
words
that
seemed
to
suggest
far
more
than
they
uttered
and
never
grew
stale
or
flat
or
foolish
with
ever
so
many
scores
of
readings
rilla
went
home
from
rainbow
valley
as
if
she
flew
rather
than
walked
but
such
moments
of
uplift
were
rare
that
autumn
to
be
sure
there
was
one
day
in
september
when
great
news
came
of
a
big
allied
victory
in
the
west
and
susan
ran
out
to
hoist
the
flag
the
first
time
she
had
hoisted
it
since
the
russian
line
broke
and
the
last
time
she
was
to
hoist
it
for
many
dismal
moons
likely
the
big
push
has
begun
at
last
dear
she
exclaimed
and
we
will
soon
see
the
finish
of
the
huns
our
boys
will
be
home
by
christmas
now
hurrah
susan
was
ashamed
of
herself
for
hurrahing
the
minute
she
had
done
it
and
apologized
meekly
for
such
an
outburst
of
juvenility
but
indeed
dear
this
good
news
has
gone
to
my
head
after
this
awful
summer
of
russian
slumps
and
gallipoli
setbacks
good
news
said
miss
oliver
bitterly
i
wonder
if
the
women
whose
men
have
been
killed
for
it
will
call
it
good
news
just
because
our
own
men
are
not
on
that
part
of
the
front
we
are
rejoicing
as
if
the
victory
had
cost
no
lives
now
miss
oliver
dear
do
not
take
that
view
of
it
deprecated
susan
we
have
not
had
much
to
rejoice
over
of
late
and
yet
men
were
being
killed
just
the
same
do
not
let
yourself
slump
like
poor
cousin
sophia
she
said
when
the
word
came
it
is
nothing
but
a
rift
in
the
clouds
we
are
up
this
week
but
we
will
be
down
the
next
sophia
crawford
said
i
for
i
will
never
give
in
to
her
dear
himself
can
not
make
two
hills
without
a
hollow
between
them
as
i
have
heard
it
said
but
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
take
the
good
of
the
hills
when
we
are
on
them
but
cousin
sophia
moaned
on
is
the
gallipolly
expedition
a
failure
and
the
grand
duke
nicholas
sent
off
and
everyone
knows
the
czar
of
rooshia
is
a
and
the
allies
have
no
ammunition
and
bulgaria
is
going
against
us
and
the
end
is
not
yet
for
england
and
france
must
be
punished
for
their
deadly
sins
until
they
repent
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
think
myself
i
said
they
will
do
their
repenting
in
khaki
and
trench
mud
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
huns
should
have
a
few
sins
to
repent
of
also
are
instruments
in
the
hands
of
the
almighty
to
purge
the
garner
said
sophia
and
then
i
got
mad
dear
and
told
her
i
did
not
and
never
would
believe
that
the
almighty
ever
took
such
dirty
instruments
in
hand
for
any
purpose
whatever
and
that
i
did
not
consider
it
decent
for
her
to
be
using
the
words
of
holy
writ
as
glibly
as
she
was
doing
in
ordinary
conversation
she
was
not
i
told
her
a
minister
or
even
an
elder
and
for
the
time
being
i
squelched
her
dear
cousin
sophia
has
no
spirit
she
is
very
different
from
her
niece
dean
crawford
you
know
the
dean
crawfords
had
five
boys
and
now
the
new
baby
is
another
boy
all
the
connection
and
especially
dean
crawford
were
much
disappointed
because
their
hearts
had
been
set
on
a
girl
but
dean
just
laughed
and
said
i
went
this
summer
i
saw
the
sign
men
wanted
staring
me
in
the
face
do
you
think
i
could
go
and
have
a
girl
under
such
circumstances
there
is
spirit
for
you
dear
but
cousin
sophia
would
say
the
child
was
just
so
much
more
cannon
fodder
cousin
sophia
had
full
range
for
her
pessimism
that
gloomy
autumn
and
even
susan
incorrigible
old
optimist
as
she
was
was
hard
put
to
it
for
cheer
when
bulgaria
lined
up
with
germany
susan
only
remarked
scornfully
one
more
nation
anxious
for
a
licking
but
the
greek
tangle
worried
her
beyond
her
powers
of
philosophy
to
endure
calmly
constantine
of
greece
has
a
german
wife
dear
and
that
fact
squelches
hope
to
think
that
i
should
have
lived
to
care
what
kind
of
a
wife
constantine
of
greece
had
the
miserable
creature
is
under
his
wife
thumb
and
that
is
a
bad
place
for
any
man
to
be
i
am
an
old
maid
and
an
old
maid
has
to
be
independent
or
she
will
be
squashed
out
but
if
i
had
been
a
married
woman
dear
i
would
have
been
meek
and
humble
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
sophia
of
greece
is
a
minx
susan
was
furious
when
the
news
came
that
venizelos
had
met
with
defeat
i
could
spank
constantine
and
skin
him
alive
afterwards
that
i
could
she
exclaimed
bitterly
oh
susan
i
surprised
at
you
said
the
doctor
pulling
a
long
face
have
you
no
regard
for
the
proprieties
skin
him
alive
by
all
means
but
omit
the
spanking
if
he
had
been
well
spanked
in
his
younger
days
he
might
have
more
sense
now
retorted
susan
but
i
suppose
princes
are
never
spanked
more
is
the
pity
i
see
the
allies
have
sent
him
an
ultimatum
i
could
tell
them
that
it
will
take
more
than
ultimatums
to
skin
a
snake
like
constantine
perhaps
the
allied
blockade
will
hammer
sense
into
his
head
but
that
will
take
some
time
i
am
thinking
and
in
the
meantime
what
is
to
become
of
poor
serbia
they
saw
what
became
of
serbia
and
during
the
process
susan
was
hardly
to
be
lived
with
in
her
exasperation
she
abused
everything
and
everybody
except
kitchener
and
she
fell
upon
poor
president
wilson
tooth
and
claw
if
he
had
done
his
duty
and
gone
into
the
war
long
ago
we
should
not
have
seen
this
mess
in
serbia
she
avowed
it
would
be
a
serious
thing
to
plunge
a
great
country
like
the
united
states
with
its
mixed
population
into
the
war
susan
said
the
doctor
who
sometimes
came
to
the
defence
of
the
president
not
because
he
thought
wilson
needed
it
especially
but
from
an
unholy
love
of
baiting
susan
maybe
doctor
dear
maybe
but
that
makes
me
think
of
the
old
story
of
the
girl
who
told
her
grandmother
she
was
going
to
be
married
is
a
solemn
thing
to
be
married
said
the
old
lady
but
it
is
a
solemner
thing
not
to
be
said
the
girl
and
i
can
testify
to
that
out
of
my
own
experience
doctor
dear
and
i
think
it
is
a
solemner
thing
for
the
yankees
that
they
have
kept
out
of
the
war
than
it
would
have
been
if
they
had
gone
into
it
however
though
i
do
not
know
much
about
them
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
we
will
see
them
starting
something
yet
woodrow
wilson
or
no
woodrow
wilson
when
they
get
it
into
their
heads
that
this
war
is
not
a
correspondence
school
they
will
not
said
susan
energetically
waving
a
saucepan
with
one
hand
and
a
soup
ladle
with
the
other
be
too
proud
to
fight
then
on
a
windy
evening
in
october
carl
meredith
went
away
he
had
enlisted
on
his
eighteenth
birthday
john
meredith
saw
him
off
with
a
set
face
his
two
boys
were
gone
there
was
only
little
bruce
left
now
he
loved
bruce
and
bruce
mother
dearly
but
jerry
and
carl
were
the
sons
of
the
bride
of
his
youth
and
carl
was
the
only
one
of
all
his
children
who
had
cecilia
very
eyes
as
they
looked
lovingly
out
at
him
above
carl
uniform
the
pale
minister
suddenly
remembered
the
day
when
for
the
first
and
last
time
he
had
tried
to
whip
carl
for
his
prank
with
the
eel
that
was
the
first
time
he
had
realised
how
much
carl
eyes
were
like
cecilia
now
he
realised
it
again
once
more
would
he
ever
again
see
his
dead
wife
eyes
looking
at
him
from
his
son
face
what
a
bonny
clean
handsome
lad
he
was
it
was
hard
to
see
him
go
john
meredith
seemed
to
be
looking
at
a
torn
plain
strewed
with
the
bodies
of
men
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
only
the
other
day
carl
had
been
a
little
scrap
of
a
boy
hunting
bugs
in
rainbow
valley
taking
lizards
to
bed
with
him
and
scandalizing
the
glen
by
carrying
frogs
to
sunday
school
it
seemed
hardly
right
somehow
that
he
should
be
an
man
in
khaki
yet
john
meredith
had
said
no
word
to
dissuade
him
when
carl
had
told
him
he
must
go
rilla
felt
carl
going
keenly
they
had
always
been
cronies
and
playmates
he
was
only
a
little
older
than
she
was
and
they
had
been
children
in
rainbow
valley
together
she
recalled
all
their
old
pranks
and
escapades
as
she
walked
slowly
home
alone
the
full
moon
peeped
through
the
scudding
clouds
with
sudden
floods
of
weird
illumination
the
telephone
wires
sang
a
shrill
weird
song
in
the
wind
and
the
tall
spikes
of
withered
in
the
fence
corners
swayed
and
beckoned
wildly
to
her
like
groups
of
old
witches
weaving
unholy
spells
on
such
a
night
as
this
long
ago
carl
would
come
over
to
ingleside
and
whistle
her
out
to
the
gate
let
go
on
a
rilla
he
would
say
and
the
two
of
them
would
scamper
off
to
rainbow
valley
rilla
had
never
been
afraid
of
his
beetles
and
bugs
though
she
drew
a
hard
and
fast
line
at
snakes
they
used
to
talk
together
of
almost
everything
and
were
teased
about
each
other
at
school
but
one
evening
when
they
were
about
ten
years
of
age
they
had
solemnly
promised
by
the
old
spring
in
rainbow
valley
that
they
would
never
marry
each
other
alice
clow
had
crossed
out
their
names
on
her
slate
in
school
that
day
and
it
came
out
that
both
married
they
did
not
like
the
idea
at
all
hence
the
mutual
vow
in
rainbow
valley
there
was
nothing
like
an
ounce
of
prevention
rilla
laughed
over
the
old
memory
and
then
sighed
that
very
day
a
dispatch
from
some
london
paper
had
contained
the
cheerful
announcement
that
the
present
moment
is
the
darkest
since
the
war
began
it
was
dark
enough
and
rilla
wished
desperately
that
she
could
do
something
besides
waiting
and
serving
at
home
as
day
after
day
the
glen
boys
she
had
known
went
away
if
she
were
only
a
boy
speeding
in
khaki
by
carl
side
to
the
western
front
she
had
wished
that
in
a
burst
of
romance
when
jem
had
gone
without
perhaps
really
meaning
it
she
meant
it
now
there
were
moments
when
waiting
at
home
in
safety
and
comfort
seemed
an
unendurable
thing
the
moon
burst
triumphantly
through
an
especially
dark
cloud
and
shadow
and
silver
chased
each
other
in
waves
over
the
glen
rilla
remembered
one
moonlit
evening
of
childhood
when
she
had
said
to
her
mother
the
moon
just
looks
like
a
sorry
sorry
face
she
thought
it
looked
like
that
still
an
agonised
face
as
though
it
looked
down
on
dreadful
sights
what
did
it
see
on
the
western
front
in
broken
serbia
on
gallipoli
i
am
tired
miss
oliver
had
said
that
day
in
a
rare
outburst
of
impatience
of
this
horrible
rack
of
strained
emotions
when
every
day
brings
a
new
horror
or
the
dread
of
it
no
do
look
reproachfully
at
me
blythe
there
nothing
heroic
about
me
today
i
slumped
i
wish
england
had
left
belgium
to
her
fate
i
wish
canada
had
never
sent
a
man
i
wish
we
tied
our
boys
to
our
apron
strings
and
not
let
one
of
them
go
oh
i
shall
be
ashamed
of
myself
in
half
an
hour
but
at
this
very
minute
i
mean
every
word
of
it
will
the
allies
never
strike
patience
is
a
tired
mare
but
she
jogs
on
said
susan
while
the
steeds
of
armageddon
thunder
trampling
over
our
hearts
retorted
miss
oliver
susan
tell
me
do
you
ever
did
you
ever
take
spells
of
feeling
that
you
must
scream
or
swear
or
smash
something
just
because
your
torture
reaches
a
point
when
it
becomes
unbearable
i
have
never
sworn
or
desired
to
swear
miss
oliver
dear
but
i
will
admit
said
susan
with
the
air
of
one
determined
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
once
and
for
all
that
i
have
experienced
occasions
when
it
was
a
relief
to
do
considerable
banging
do
you
think
that
is
a
kind
of
swearing
susan
what
is
the
difference
between
slamming
a
door
viciously
and
saying
d
miss
oliver
dear
interrupted
susan
desperately
determined
to
save
gertrude
from
herself
if
human
power
could
do
it
you
are
all
tired
out
and
unstrung
and
no
wonder
teaching
those
obstreperous
youngsters
all
day
and
coming
home
to
bad
war
news
but
just
you
go
upstairs
and
lie
down
and
i
will
bring
you
up
a
cup
of
hot
tea
and
a
bite
of
toast
and
very
soon
you
will
not
want
to
slam
doors
or
swear
susan
you
a
good
soul
a
very
pearl
of
susans
but
susan
it
would
be
such
a
relief
to
say
just
one
soft
low
little
tiny
d
i
will
bring
you
a
bottle
for
the
soles
of
your
feet
also
interposed
susan
resolutely
and
it
would
not
be
any
relief
to
say
that
word
you
are
thinking
of
miss
oliver
and
that
you
may
tie
to
well
i
try
the
bottle
first
said
miss
oliver
repenting
herself
on
teasing
susan
and
vanishing
upstairs
to
intense
relief
susan
shook
her
head
ominously
as
she
filled
the
bottle
the
war
was
certainly
relaxing
the
standards
of
behaviour
woefully
here
was
miss
oliver
admittedly
on
the
point
of
profanity
we
must
draw
the
blood
from
her
brain
said
susan
and
if
this
bottle
is
not
effective
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
with
a
mustard
plaster
gertrude
rallied
and
carried
on
lord
kitchener
went
to
greece
whereat
susan
foretold
that
constantine
would
soon
experience
a
change
of
heart
lloyd
george
began
to
heckle
the
allies
regarding
equipment
and
guns
and
susan
said
you
would
hear
more
of
lloyd
george
yet
the
gallant
anzacs
withdrew
from
gallipoli
and
susan
approved
the
step
with
reservations
the
siege
of
began
and
susan
pored
over
maps
of
mesopotamia
and
abused
the
turks
henry
ford
started
for
europe
and
susan
flayed
him
with
sarcasm
sir
john
french
was
superseded
by
sir
douglas
haig
and
susan
dubiously
opined
that
it
was
poor
policy
to
swap
horses
crossing
a
stream
though
to
be
sure
haig
was
a
good
name
and
french
had
a
foreign
sound
say
what
you
might
not
a
move
on
the
great
of
king
or
bishop
or
pawn
escaped
susan
who
had
once
read
only
glen
mary
notes
there
was
a
time
she
said
sorrowfully
when
i
did
not
care
what
happened
outside
of
island
and
now
a
king
can
not
have
a
toothache
in
russia
or
china
but
it
worries
me
it
may
be
broadening
to
the
mind
as
the
doctor
said
but
it
is
very
painful
to
the
feelings
when
christmas
came
again
susan
did
not
set
any
vacant
places
at
the
festive
board
two
empty
chairs
were
too
much
even
for
susan
who
had
thought
in
september
that
there
would
not
be
one
this
is
the
first
christmas
that
walter
was
not
home
rilla
wrote
in
her
diary
that
night
jem
used
to
be
away
for
christmases
up
in
avonlea
but
walter
never
was
i
had
letters
from
ken
and
him
today
they
are
still
in
england
but
expect
to
be
in
the
trenches
very
soon
and
then
but
i
suppose
we
be
able
to
endure
it
somehow
to
me
the
strangest
of
all
the
strange
things
since
is
how
we
have
all
learned
to
accept
things
we
never
thought
we
could
to
go
on
with
life
as
a
matter
of
course
i
know
that
jem
and
jerry
are
in
the
trenches
that
ken
and
walter
will
be
soon
that
if
one
of
them
does
not
come
back
my
heart
will
break
yet
i
go
on
and
work
and
plan
yes
and
even
enjoy
life
by
times
there
are
moments
when
we
have
real
fun
because
just
for
the
moment
we
do
think
about
things
and
then
we
remember
and
the
remembering
is
worse
than
thinking
of
it
all
the
time
would
have
been
today
was
dark
and
cloudy
and
tonight
is
wild
enough
as
gertrude
says
to
please
any
novelist
in
search
of
suitable
matter
for
a
murder
or
elopement
the
raindrops
streaming
over
the
panes
look
like
tears
running
down
a
face
and
the
wind
is
shrieking
through
the
maple
grove
this
has
been
a
nice
christmas
day
in
any
way
nan
had
toothache
and
susan
had
red
eyes
and
assumed
a
weird
and
gruesome
flippancy
of
manner
to
deceive
us
into
thinking
she
had
and
jims
had
a
bad
cold
all
day
and
i
afraid
of
croup
he
has
had
croup
twice
since
october
the
first
time
i
was
nearly
frightened
to
death
for
father
and
mother
were
both
away
father
always
is
away
it
seems
to
me
when
any
of
this
household
gets
sick
but
susan
was
cool
as
a
fish
and
knew
just
what
to
do
and
by
morning
jims
was
all
right
that
child
is
a
cross
between
a
duck
and
an
imp
he
a
year
and
four
months
old
trots
about
everywhere
and
says
quite
a
few
words
he
has
the
cutest
little
way
of
calling
me
it
always
brings
back
that
dreadful
ridiculous
delightful
night
when
ken
came
to
say
and
i
was
so
furious
and
happy
jims
is
pink
and
white
and
and
and
every
now
and
then
i
discover
a
new
dimple
in
him
i
can
never
quite
believe
he
is
really
the
same
creature
as
that
scrawny
yellow
ugly
little
changeling
i
brought
home
in
the
soup
tureen
nobody
has
ever
heard
a
word
from
jim
anderson
if
he
never
comes
back
i
shall
keep
jims
always
everybody
here
worships
and
spoils
him
or
would
spoil
him
if
morgan
and
i
did
stand
remorselessly
in
the
way
susan
says
jims
is
the
cleverest
child
she
ever
saw
and
can
recognize
old
nick
when
he
sees
him
this
because
jims
threw
poor
doc
out
of
an
upstairs
window
one
day
doc
turned
into
hyde
on
his
way
down
and
landed
in
a
currant
bush
spitting
and
swearing
i
tried
to
console
his
inner
cat
with
a
saucer
of
milk
but
he
would
have
none
of
it
and
remained
hyde
the
rest
of
the
day
jims
latest
exploit
was
to
paint
the
cushion
of
the
big
in
the
sun
parlour
with
molasses
and
before
anybody
found
it
out
fred
clow
came
in
on
red
cross
business
and
sat
down
on
it
her
new
silk
dress
was
ruined
and
nobody
could
blame
her
for
being
vexed
but
she
went
into
one
of
her
tempers
and
said
nasty
things
and
gave
me
such
slams
about
jims
that
i
nearly
boiled
over
too
but
i
kept
the
lid
on
till
she
had
waddled
away
and
then
i
exploded
fat
clumsy
horrid
old
thing
i
said
and
oh
what
a
satisfaction
it
was
to
say
it
has
three
sons
at
the
front
mother
said
rebukingly
suppose
that
covers
all
her
shortcomings
in
manners
i
retorted
but
i
was
ashamed
for
it
is
true
that
all
her
boys
have
gone
and
she
was
very
plucky
and
loyal
about
it
too
and
she
is
a
perfect
tower
of
strength
in
the
red
cross
it
a
little
hard
to
remember
all
the
heroines
just
the
same
it
was
her
second
new
silk
dress
in
one
year
and
that
when
everybody
is
or
should
be
trying
to
and
serve
i
had
to
bring
out
my
green
velvet
hat
again
lately
and
begin
wearing
it
i
hung
on
to
my
blue
straw
sailor
as
long
as
i
could
how
i
hate
the
green
velvet
hat
it
is
so
elaborate
and
conspicuous
i
do
see
how
i
could
ever
have
liked
it
but
i
vowed
to
wear
it
and
wear
it
i
will
shirley
and
i
went
down
to
the
station
this
morning
to
take
little
dog
monday
a
christmas
dinner
dog
monday
waits
and
watches
there
still
with
just
as
much
hope
and
confidence
as
ever
sometimes
he
hangs
around
the
station
house
and
talks
to
people
and
the
rest
of
his
time
he
sits
at
his
little
kennel
door
and
watches
the
track
unwinkingly
we
never
try
to
coax
him
home
now
we
know
it
is
of
no
use
when
jem
comes
back
monday
will
come
home
with
him
and
if
jem
never
comes
back
monday
will
wait
there
for
him
as
long
as
his
dear
dog
heart
goes
on
beating
fred
arnold
was
here
last
night
he
was
eighteen
in
november
and
is
going
to
enlist
just
as
soon
as
his
mother
is
over
an
operation
she
has
to
have
he
has
been
coming
here
very
often
lately
and
though
i
like
him
so
much
it
makes
me
uncomfortable
because
i
am
afraid
he
is
thinking
that
perhaps
i
could
care
something
for
him
i
ca
tell
him
about
ken
because
after
all
what
is
there
to
tell
and
yet
i
like
to
behave
coldly
and
distantly
when
he
will
be
going
away
so
soon
it
is
very
perplexing
i
remember
i
used
to
think
it
would
be
such
fun
to
have
dozens
of
beaux
and
now
i
worried
to
death
because
two
are
too
many
i
am
learning
to
cook
susan
is
teaching
me
i
tried
to
learn
long
ago
but
no
let
me
be
honest
susan
tried
to
teach
me
which
is
a
very
different
thing
i
never
seemed
to
succeed
with
anything
and
i
got
discouraged
but
since
the
boys
have
gone
away
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
make
cake
and
things
for
them
myself
and
so
i
started
in
again
and
this
time
i
getting
on
surprisingly
well
susan
says
it
is
all
in
the
way
i
hold
my
mouth
and
father
says
my
subconscious
mind
is
desirous
of
learning
now
and
i
dare
say
they
both
right
anyhow
i
can
make
dandy
and
fruitcake
i
got
ambitious
last
week
and
attempted
cream
puffs
but
made
an
awful
failure
of
them
they
came
out
of
the
oven
flat
as
flukes
i
thought
maybe
the
cream
would
fill
them
up
again
and
make
them
plump
but
it
did
i
think
susan
was
secretly
pleased
she
is
past
mistress
in
the
art
of
making
cream
puffs
and
it
would
break
her
heart
if
anyone
else
here
could
make
them
as
well
i
wonder
if
susan
tampered
but
no
i
wo
suspect
her
of
such
a
thing
miranda
pryor
spent
an
afternoon
here
a
few
days
ago
helping
me
cut
out
certain
red
cross
garments
known
by
the
charming
name
of
shirts
susan
thinks
that
name
is
not
quite
decent
so
i
suggested
she
call
them
sarks
which
is
old
highland
sandy
version
of
it
but
she
shook
her
head
and
i
heard
her
telling
mother
later
that
in
her
opinion
and
were
not
proper
subjects
for
young
girls
to
talk
about
she
was
especially
horrified
when
jem
wrote
in
his
last
letter
to
mother
susan
i
had
a
fine
cootie
hunt
this
morning
and
caught
susan
positively
turned
dear
she
said
i
was
young
if
decent
people
were
so
unfortunate
as
to
get
those
insects
they
kept
it
a
secret
if
possible
i
do
not
want
to
be
dear
but
i
still
think
it
is
better
not
to
mention
such
things
miranda
grew
confidential
over
our
vermin
shirts
and
told
me
all
her
troubles
she
is
desperately
unhappy
she
is
engaged
to
joe
milgrave
and
joe
joined
up
in
october
and
has
been
training
in
charlottetown
ever
since
her
father
was
furious
when
he
joined
and
forbade
miranda
ever
to
have
any
dealing
or
communication
with
him
again
poor
joe
expects
to
go
overseas
any
day
and
wants
miranda
to
marry
him
before
he
goes
which
shows
that
there
have
been
in
spite
of
miranda
wants
to
marry
him
but
can
not
and
she
declares
it
will
break
her
heart
do
you
run
away
and
marry
him
i
said
it
did
go
against
my
conscience
in
the
least
to
give
her
such
advice
joe
milgrave
is
a
splendid
fellow
and
pryor
fairly
beamed
on
him
until
the
war
broke
out
and
i
know
pryor
would
forgive
miranda
very
quickly
once
it
was
over
and
he
wanted
his
housekeeper
back
but
miranda
shook
her
silvery
head
dolefully
wants
me
to
but
i
ca
mother
last
words
to
me
as
she
lay
on
her
were
never
never
run
away
miranda
and
i
promised
miranda
mother
died
two
years
ago
and
it
seems
according
to
miranda
that
her
mother
and
father
actually
ran
away
to
be
married
themselves
to
picture
as
the
hero
of
an
elopement
is
beyond
my
power
but
such
was
the
case
and
pryor
at
least
lived
to
repent
it
she
had
a
hard
life
of
it
with
pryor
and
she
thought
it
was
a
punishment
on
her
for
running
away
so
she
made
miranda
promise
she
would
never
for
any
reason
whatever
do
it
of
course
you
can
not
urge
a
girl
to
break
a
promise
made
to
a
dying
mother
so
i
did
not
see
what
miranda
could
do
unless
she
got
joe
to
come
to
the
house
when
her
father
was
away
and
marry
her
there
but
miranda
said
that
could
be
managed
her
father
seemed
to
suspect
she
might
be
up
to
something
of
the
sort
and
he
never
went
away
for
long
at
a
time
and
of
course
joe
could
get
leave
of
absence
at
an
notice
i
shall
just
have
to
let
joe
go
and
he
will
be
killed
i
know
he
will
be
killed
and
my
heart
will
break
said
miranda
her
tears
running
down
and
copiously
bedewing
the
vermin
shirts
i
am
not
writing
like
this
for
lack
of
any
real
sympathy
with
poor
miranda
i
just
got
into
the
habit
of
giving
things
a
comical
twist
if
i
can
when
i
writing
to
jem
and
walter
and
ken
to
make
them
laugh
i
really
felt
sorry
for
miranda
who
is
as
much
in
love
with
joe
as
a
girl
can
be
with
anyone
and
who
is
dreadfully
ashamed
of
her
father
sentiments
i
think
she
understood
that
i
did
for
she
said
she
had
wanted
to
tell
me
all
about
her
worries
because
i
had
grown
so
sympathetic
this
past
year
i
wonder
if
i
have
i
know
i
used
to
be
a
selfish
thoughtless
creature
how
selfish
and
thoughtless
i
am
ashamed
to
remember
now
so
i
ca
be
quite
so
bad
as
i
was
i
wish
i
could
help
miranda
it
would
be
very
romantic
to
contrive
a
and
i
should
dearly
love
to
get
the
better
of
but
at
present
the
oracle
has
not
spoken
chapter
xviii
a
i
can
tell
you
this
dear
said
susan
pale
with
wrath
that
germany
is
getting
to
be
perfectly
ridiculous
they
were
all
in
the
big
ingleside
kitchen
susan
was
mixing
biscuits
for
supper
blythe
was
making
shortbread
for
jem
and
rilla
was
compounding
candy
for
ken
and
walter
it
had
once
been
walter
and
ken
in
her
thoughts
but
somehow
quite
unconsciously
this
had
changed
until
ken
name
came
naturally
first
cousin
sophia
was
also
there
knitting
all
the
boys
were
going
to
be
killed
in
the
long
run
so
cousin
sophia
felt
in
her
bones
but
they
might
better
die
with
warm
feet
than
cold
ones
so
cousin
sophia
knitted
faithfully
and
gloomily
into
this
peaceful
scene
erupted
the
doctor
wrathful
and
excited
over
the
burning
of
the
parliament
buildings
in
ottawa
and
susan
became
automatically
quite
as
wrathful
and
excited
what
will
those
huns
do
next
she
demanded
coming
over
here
and
burning
our
parliament
building
did
anyone
ever
hear
of
such
an
outrage
we
do
know
that
the
germans
are
responsible
for
this
said
the
doctor
much
as
if
he
felt
quite
sure
they
were
fires
do
start
without
their
agency
sometimes
and
uncle
mark
macallister
barn
was
burnt
last
week
you
can
hardly
accuse
the
germans
of
that
susan
indeed
dear
i
do
not
know
susan
nodded
slowly
and
portentously
was
there
that
very
day
the
fire
broke
out
half
an
hour
after
he
was
gone
so
much
is
a
fact
but
i
shall
not
accuse
a
presbyterian
elder
of
burning
anybody
barn
until
i
have
proof
however
everybody
knows
dear
that
both
uncle
boys
have
enlisted
and
that
uncle
mark
himself
makes
speeches
at
all
the
recruiting
meetings
so
no
doubt
germany
is
anxious
to
get
square
with
him
i
could
never
speak
at
a
recruiting
meeting
said
cousin
sophia
solemnly
i
could
never
reconcile
it
to
my
conscience
to
ask
another
woman
son
to
go
to
murder
and
be
murdered
could
you
not
said
susan
well
sophia
crawford
i
felt
as
if
i
could
ask
anyone
to
go
when
i
read
last
night
that
there
were
no
children
under
eight
years
of
age
left
alive
in
poland
think
of
that
sophia
crawford
susan
shook
a
floury
finger
at
sophia
not
one
child
under
eight
years
of
age
i
suppose
the
germans
has
et
all
sighed
cousin
sophia
well
said
susan
reluctantly
as
if
she
hated
to
admit
that
there
was
any
crime
the
huns
could
be
accused
of
the
germans
have
not
turned
cannibal
yet
as
far
as
i
know
they
have
died
of
starvation
and
exposure
the
poor
little
creatures
there
is
murdering
for
you
cousin
sophia
crawford
the
thought
of
it
poisons
every
bite
and
sup
i
take
i
see
that
fred
carson
of
lowbridge
has
been
awarded
a
distinguished
conduct
medal
remarked
the
doctor
over
his
local
paper
i
heard
that
last
week
said
susan
he
is
a
battalion
runner
and
he
did
something
extra
brave
and
daring
his
letter
telling
his
folks
about
it
came
when
his
old
grandmother
carson
was
on
her
she
had
only
a
few
minutes
more
to
live
and
the
episcopal
minister
who
was
there
asked
her
if
she
would
not
like
him
to
pray
yes
yes
you
can
pray
she
said
she
was
a
dean
dear
and
the
deans
were
always
can
pray
but
for
pity
sake
pray
low
and
do
disturb
me
i
want
to
think
over
this
splendid
news
and
i
have
not
much
time
left
to
do
it
that
was
almira
carson
all
over
fred
was
the
apple
of
her
eye
she
was
years
of
age
and
had
not
a
grey
hair
in
her
head
they
tell
me
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
i
found
a
grey
hair
this
morning
my
very
first
said
blythe
i
have
noticed
that
grey
hair
for
some
time
dear
but
i
did
not
speak
of
it
thought
i
to
myself
has
enough
to
bear
but
now
that
you
have
discovered
it
let
me
remind
you
that
grey
hairs
are
honourable
i
must
be
getting
old
gilbert
blythe
laughed
a
trifle
ruefully
people
are
beginning
to
tell
me
i
look
so
young
they
never
tell
you
that
when
you
are
young
but
i
shall
not
worry
over
my
silver
thread
i
never
liked
red
hair
gilbert
did
i
ever
tell
you
of
that
time
years
ago
at
green
gables
when
i
dyed
my
hair
nobody
but
marilla
and
i
knew
about
it
was
that
the
reason
you
came
out
once
with
your
hair
shingled
to
the
bone
yes
i
bought
a
bottle
of
dye
from
a
german
jew
pedlar
i
fondly
expected
it
would
turn
my
hair
black
and
it
turned
it
green
so
it
had
to
be
cut
off
you
had
a
narrow
escape
dear
exclaimed
susan
of
course
you
were
too
young
then
to
know
what
a
german
was
it
was
a
special
mercy
of
providence
that
it
was
only
green
dye
and
not
poison
it
seems
hundreds
of
years
since
those
green
gables
days
sighed
blythe
they
belonged
to
another
world
altogether
life
has
been
cut
in
two
by
the
chasm
of
war
what
is
ahead
i
do
know
but
it
ca
be
a
bit
like
the
past
i
wonder
if
those
of
us
who
have
lived
half
our
lives
in
the
old
world
will
ever
feel
wholly
at
home
in
the
new
have
you
noticed
asked
miss
oliver
glancing
up
from
her
book
how
everything
written
before
the
war
seems
so
far
away
now
too
one
feels
as
if
one
was
reading
something
as
ancient
as
the
iliad
this
poem
of
wordsworth
the
senior
class
have
it
in
their
entrance
work
been
glancing
over
it
its
classic
calm
and
repose
and
the
beauty
of
the
lines
seem
to
belong
to
another
planet
and
to
have
as
little
to
do
with
the
present
as
the
evening
star
the
only
thing
that
i
find
much
comfort
in
reading
nowadays
is
the
bible
remarked
susan
whisking
her
biscuits
into
the
oven
there
are
so
many
passages
in
it
that
seem
to
me
exactly
descriptive
of
the
huns
old
highland
sandy
declares
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
kaiser
is
the
spoken
of
in
revelations
but
i
do
not
go
as
far
as
that
it
would
in
my
humble
opinion
dear
be
too
great
an
honour
for
him
early
one
morning
several
days
later
miranda
pryor
slipped
up
to
ingleside
ostensibly
to
get
some
red
cross
sewing
but
in
reality
to
talk
over
with
sympathetic
rilla
troubles
that
were
past
bearing
alone
she
brought
her
dog
with
her
an
little
animal
very
dear
to
her
heart
because
joe
milgrave
had
given
it
to
her
when
it
was
a
puppy
pryor
regarded
all
dogs
with
disfavour
but
in
those
days
he
had
looked
kindly
upon
joe
as
a
suitor
for
miranda
hand
and
so
he
had
allowed
her
to
keep
the
puppy
miranda
was
so
grateful
that
she
endeavoured
to
please
her
father
by
naming
her
dog
after
his
political
idol
the
great
liberal
chieftain
sir
wilfrid
laurier
though
his
title
was
soon
abbreviated
to
wilfy
sir
wilfrid
grew
and
flourished
and
waxed
fat
but
miranda
spoiled
him
absurdly
and
nobody
else
liked
him
rilla
especially
hated
him
because
of
his
detestable
trick
of
lying
flat
on
his
back
and
entreating
you
with
waving
paws
to
tickle
his
sleek
stomach
when
she
saw
that
pale
eyes
bore
unmistakable
testimony
of
her
having
cried
all
night
rilla
asked
her
to
come
up
to
her
room
knowing
miranda
had
a
tale
of
woe
to
tell
but
she
ordered
sir
wilfrid
to
remain
below
oh
ca
he
come
too
said
miranda
wistfully
poor
wilfy
wo
be
any
bother
and
i
wiped
his
paws
so
carefully
before
i
brought
him
in
he
is
always
so
lonesome
in
a
strange
place
without
me
and
very
soon
he
be
all
i
have
left
to
remind
me
of
joe
rilla
yielded
and
sir
wilfrid
with
his
tail
curled
at
a
saucy
angle
over
his
brindled
back
trotted
triumphantly
up
the
stairs
before
them
oh
rilla
sobbed
miranda
when
they
had
reached
sanctuary
i
so
unhappy
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
how
unhappy
i
am
truly
my
heart
is
breaking
rilla
sat
down
on
the
lounge
beside
her
sir
wilfrid
squatted
on
his
haunches
before
them
with
his
impertinent
pink
tongue
stuck
out
and
listened
what
is
the
trouble
miranda
joe
is
coming
home
tonight
on
his
last
leave
i
had
a
letter
from
him
on
saturday
he
sends
my
letters
in
care
of
bob
crawford
you
know
because
of
father
and
oh
rilla
he
will
only
have
four
days
he
has
to
go
away
friday
morning
and
i
may
never
see
him
again
does
he
still
want
you
to
marry
him
asked
rilla
oh
yes
he
implored
me
in
his
letter
to
run
away
and
be
married
but
i
can
not
do
that
rilla
not
even
for
joe
my
only
comfort
is
that
i
will
be
able
to
see
him
for
a
little
while
tomorrow
afternoon
father
has
to
go
to
charlottetown
on
business
at
least
we
will
have
one
good
farewell
talk
but
oh
afterwards
why
rilla
i
know
father
wo
even
let
me
go
to
the
station
friday
morning
to
see
joe
off
why
in
the
world
do
you
and
joe
get
married
tomorrow
afternoon
at
home
demanded
rilla
miranda
swallowed
a
sob
in
such
amazement
that
she
almost
choked
why
why
that
is
impossible
rilla
why
briefly
demanded
the
organizer
of
the
junior
red
cross
and
the
transporter
of
babies
in
soup
tureens
why
why
we
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
joe
has
a
license
i
have
no
dress
i
could
be
married
in
black
i
i
we
you
you
miranda
lost
herself
altogether
and
sir
wilfrid
seeing
that
she
was
in
dire
distress
threw
back
his
head
and
emitted
a
melancholy
yelp
rilla
blythe
thought
hard
and
rapidly
for
a
few
minutes
then
she
said
miranda
if
you
will
put
yourself
into
my
hands
i
have
you
married
to
joe
before
four
tomorrow
afternoon
oh
you
could
i
can
and
i
will
but
you
have
to
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
oh
i
do
think
oh
father
will
kill
me
nonsense
he
be
very
angry
i
suppose
but
are
you
more
afraid
of
your
father
anger
than
you
are
of
joe
never
coming
back
to
you
no
said
miranda
with
sudden
firmness
i
not
will
you
do
as
i
tell
you
then
yes
i
will
then
get
joe
on
the
at
once
and
tell
him
to
bring
out
a
license
and
ring
tonight
oh
i
could
wailed
the
aghast
miranda
it
it
would
be
so
so
indelicate
rilla
shut
her
little
white
teeth
together
with
a
snap
heaven
grant
me
patience
she
said
under
her
breath
i
do
it
then
she
said
aloud
and
meanwhile
you
go
home
and
make
what
preparations
you
can
when
i
down
to
you
to
come
up
and
help
me
sew
come
at
once
as
soon
as
miranda
pallid
scared
but
desperately
resolved
had
gone
rilla
flew
to
the
telephone
and
put
in
a
call
for
charlottetown
she
got
through
with
such
surprising
quickness
that
she
was
convinced
providence
approved
of
her
undertaking
but
it
was
a
good
hour
before
she
could
get
in
touch
with
joe
milgrave
at
his
camp
meanwhile
she
paced
impatiently
about
and
prayed
that
when
she
did
get
joe
there
would
be
no
listeners
on
the
line
to
carry
news
to
is
that
you
joe
rilla
blythe
is
speaking
rilla
rilla
oh
never
mind
listen
to
this
before
you
come
home
tonight
get
a
marriage
license
a
marriage
license
yes
a
marriage
license
and
a
did
you
get
that
and
will
you
do
it
very
well
be
sure
you
do
it
it
is
your
only
chance
flushed
with
triumph
for
her
only
fear
was
that
she
might
not
be
able
to
locate
joe
in
time
rilla
rang
the
pryor
ring
this
time
she
had
not
such
good
luck
for
she
drew
is
that
miranda
oh
pryor
well
pryor
will
you
kindly
ask
miranda
if
she
can
come
up
this
afternoon
and
help
me
with
some
sewing
it
is
very
important
or
i
would
not
trouble
her
oh
thank
you
pryor
had
consented
somewhat
grumpily
but
he
had
consented
he
did
not
want
to
offend
blythe
and
he
knew
that
if
he
refused
to
allow
miranda
to
do
any
red
cross
work
public
opinion
would
make
the
glen
too
hot
for
comfort
rilla
went
out
to
the
kitchen
shut
all
the
doors
with
a
mysterious
expression
which
alarmed
susan
and
then
said
solemnly
susan
can
you
make
a
this
afternoon
a
susan
stared
rilla
had
without
any
warning
brought
her
a
once
upon
a
time
was
she
now
with
equal
suddenness
going
to
produce
a
husband
yes
a
a
scrumptious
susan
a
beautiful
plummy
eggy
and
we
must
make
other
things
too
i
help
you
in
the
morning
but
i
ca
help
you
in
the
afternoon
for
i
have
to
make
a
and
time
is
the
essence
of
the
contract
susan
susan
felt
that
she
was
really
too
old
to
be
subjected
to
such
shocks
who
are
you
going
to
marry
rilla
she
asked
feebly
susan
darling
i
am
not
the
happy
bride
miranda
pryor
is
going
to
marry
joe
milgrave
tomorrow
afternoon
while
her
father
is
away
in
town
a
susan
is
that
thrilling
and
romantic
i
never
was
so
excited
in
my
life
the
excitement
soon
spread
over
ingleside
infecting
even
blythe
and
susan
i
go
to
work
on
that
cake
at
once
vowed
susan
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
dear
will
you
pick
over
the
fruit
and
beat
up
the
eggs
if
you
will
i
can
have
that
cake
ready
for
the
oven
by
the
evening
tomorrow
morning
we
can
make
salads
and
other
things
i
will
work
all
night
if
necessary
to
get
the
better
of
miranda
arrived
tearful
and
breathless
we
must
fix
over
my
white
dress
for
you
to
wear
said
rilla
it
will
fit
you
very
nicely
with
a
little
alteration
to
work
went
the
two
girls
ripping
fitting
basting
sewing
for
dear
life
by
dint
of
unceasing
effort
they
got
the
dress
done
by
seven
and
miranda
tried
it
on
in
rilla
room
it
very
pretty
but
oh
if
i
could
just
have
a
veil
sighed
miranda
i
always
dreamed
of
being
married
in
a
lovely
white
veil
some
good
fairy
evidently
waits
on
the
wishes
of
the
door
opened
and
blythe
came
in
her
arms
full
of
a
filmy
burden
miranda
dear
she
said
i
want
you
to
wear
my
tomorrow
it
is
years
since
i
was
a
bride
at
old
green
gables
the
happiest
bride
that
ever
was
and
the
of
a
happy
bride
brings
good
luck
they
say
oh
how
sweet
of
you
blythe
said
miranda
the
ready
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
the
veil
was
tried
on
and
draped
susan
dropped
in
to
approve
but
dared
not
linger
i
got
that
cake
in
the
oven
she
said
and
i
am
pursuing
a
policy
of
watchful
waiting
the
evening
news
is
that
the
grand
duke
has
captured
erzerum
that
is
a
pill
for
the
turks
i
wish
i
had
a
chance
to
tell
the
czar
just
what
a
mistake
he
made
when
he
turned
nicholas
down
susan
disappeared
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
whence
a
dreadful
thud
and
a
piercing
shriek
presently
sounded
everybody
rushed
to
the
kitchen
the
doctor
and
miss
oliver
blythe
rilla
miranda
in
her
susan
was
sitting
flatly
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
floor
with
a
dazed
bewildered
look
on
her
face
while
doc
evidently
in
his
hyde
incarnation
was
standing
on
the
dresser
with
his
back
up
his
eyes
blazing
and
his
tail
the
size
of
three
tails
susan
what
has
happened
cried
blythe
in
alarm
did
you
fall
are
you
hurt
susan
picked
herself
up
no
she
said
grimly
i
am
not
hurt
though
i
am
jarred
all
over
do
not
be
alarmed
as
for
what
has
happened
i
tried
to
kick
that
darned
cat
with
both
feet
that
is
what
happened
everybody
shrieked
with
laughter
the
doctor
was
quite
helpless
oh
susan
susan
he
gasped
that
i
should
live
to
hear
you
swear
i
am
sorry
said
susan
in
real
distress
that
i
used
such
an
expression
before
two
young
girls
but
i
said
that
beast
was
darned
and
darned
it
is
it
belongs
to
old
nick
do
you
expect
it
will
vanish
some
of
these
days
with
a
bang
and
the
odour
of
brimstone
susan
it
will
go
to
its
own
place
in
due
time
and
that
you
may
tie
to
said
susan
dourly
shaking
out
her
raddled
bones
and
going
to
her
oven
i
suppose
my
plunking
down
like
that
has
shaken
my
cake
so
that
it
will
be
as
heavy
as
lead
but
the
cake
was
not
heavy
it
was
all
a
bride
cake
should
be
and
susan
iced
it
beautifully
next
day
she
and
rilla
worked
all
the
forenoon
making
delicacies
for
the
and
as
soon
as
miranda
phoned
up
that
her
father
was
safely
off
everything
was
packed
in
a
big
hamper
and
taken
down
to
the
pryor
house
joe
soon
arrived
in
his
uniform
and
a
state
of
violent
excitement
accompanied
by
his
best
man
sergeant
malcolm
crawford
there
were
quite
a
few
guests
for
all
the
manse
and
ingleside
folk
were
there
and
a
dozen
or
so
of
relatives
including
his
mother
dead
angus
milgrave
so
called
cheerfully
to
distinguish
her
from
another
lady
whose
angus
was
living
dead
angus
wore
a
rather
disapproving
expression
not
caring
for
this
alliance
with
the
house
of
so
miranda
pryor
was
married
to
private
joseph
milgrave
on
his
last
leave
it
should
have
been
a
romantic
wedding
but
it
was
not
there
were
too
many
factors
working
against
romance
as
even
rilla
had
to
admit
in
the
first
place
miranda
in
spite
of
her
dress
and
veil
was
such
a
commonplace
uninteresting
little
bride
in
the
second
place
joe
cried
bitterly
all
through
the
ceremony
and
this
vexed
miranda
unreasonably
long
afterwards
she
told
rilla
i
just
felt
like
saying
to
him
then
and
there
you
feel
so
bad
over
having
to
marry
me
you
do
have
to
but
it
was
just
because
he
was
thinking
all
the
time
of
how
soon
he
would
have
to
leave
me
in
the
third
place
jims
who
was
usually
so
in
public
took
a
fit
of
shyness
and
contrariness
combined
and
began
to
cry
at
the
top
of
his
voice
for
willa
nobody
wanted
to
take
him
out
because
everybody
wanted
to
see
the
marriage
so
rilla
who
was
a
bridesmaid
had
to
take
him
and
hold
him
during
the
ceremony
in
the
fourth
place
sir
wilfrid
laurier
took
a
fit
sir
wilfrid
was
entrenched
in
a
corner
of
the
room
behind
piano
during
his
seizure
he
made
the
weirdest
most
unearthly
noises
he
would
begin
with
a
series
of
choking
spasmodic
sounds
continuing
into
a
gruesome
gurgle
and
ending
up
with
a
strangled
howl
nobody
could
hear
a
word
meredith
was
saying
except
now
and
then
when
sir
wilfrid
stopped
for
breath
nobody
looked
at
the
bride
except
susan
who
never
dragged
her
fascinated
eyes
from
miranda
face
all
the
others
were
gazing
at
the
dog
miranda
had
been
trembling
with
nervousness
but
as
soon
as
sir
wilfrid
began
his
performance
she
forgot
it
all
that
she
could
think
of
was
that
her
dear
dog
was
dying
and
she
could
not
go
to
him
she
never
remembered
a
word
of
the
ceremony
rilla
who
in
spite
of
jims
had
been
trying
her
best
to
look
rapt
and
romantic
as
beseemed
a
war
bridesmaid
gave
up
the
hopeless
attempt
and
devoted
her
energies
to
choking
down
untimely
merriment
she
dared
not
look
at
anybody
in
the
room
especially
dead
angus
for
fear
all
her
suppressed
mirth
should
suddenly
explode
in
a
most
yell
of
laughter
but
married
they
were
and
then
they
had
a
in
the
which
was
so
lavish
and
bountiful
that
you
would
have
thought
it
was
the
product
of
a
month
labour
everybody
had
brought
something
dead
angus
had
brought
a
large
which
she
placed
on
a
chair
in
the
and
then
absently
sat
down
on
it
neither
her
temper
nor
her
black
silk
wedding
garment
was
improved
thereby
but
the
pie
was
never
missed
at
the
gay
bridal
feast
dead
angus
eventually
took
it
home
with
her
again
pacifist
pig
should
not
get
it
anyhow
that
evening
and
joe
accompanied
by
the
recovered
sir
wilfrid
departed
for
the
four
winds
lighthouse
which
was
kept
by
joe
uncle
and
in
which
they
meant
to
spend
their
brief
honeymoon
una
meredith
and
rilla
and
susan
washed
the
dishes
tidied
up
left
a
cold
supper
and
miranda
pitiful
little
note
on
the
table
for
pryor
and
walked
home
while
the
mystic
veil
of
dreamy
haunted
winter
twilight
wrapped
itself
over
the
glen
i
would
really
not
have
minded
being
a
myself
remarked
susan
sentimentally
but
rilla
felt
rather
flat
perhaps
as
a
reaction
to
all
the
excitement
and
rush
of
the
past
hours
she
was
disappointed
somehow
the
whole
affair
had
been
so
ludicrous
and
miranda
and
joe
so
lachrymose
and
commonplace
if
miranda
had
given
that
wretched
dog
such
an
enormous
dinner
he
would
have
had
that
fit
she
said
crossly
i
warned
her
but
she
said
she
could
starve
the
poor
dog
he
would
soon
be
all
she
had
left
etc
i
could
have
shaken
her
the
best
man
was
more
excited
than
joe
was
said
susan
he
wished
miranda
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
she
did
not
look
very
happy
but
perhaps
you
could
not
expect
that
under
the
circumstances
anyhow
thought
rilla
i
can
write
a
perfectly
killing
account
of
it
all
to
the
boys
how
jem
will
howl
over
sir
wilfrid
part
in
it
but
if
rilla
was
rather
disappointed
in
the
war
wedding
she
found
nothing
lacking
on
friday
morning
when
miranda
said
to
her
bridegroom
at
the
glen
station
the
dawn
was
white
as
a
pearl
clear
as
a
diamond
behind
the
station
the
balsamy
copse
of
young
firs
was
the
cold
moon
of
dawn
hung
over
the
westering
snow
fields
but
the
golden
fleeces
of
sunrise
shone
above
the
maples
up
at
ingleside
joe
took
his
pale
little
bride
in
his
arms
and
she
lifted
her
face
to
his
rilla
choked
suddenly
it
did
not
matter
that
miranda
was
insignificant
and
commonplace
and
it
did
not
matter
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
all
that
mattered
was
that
rapt
sacrificial
look
in
her
eyes
that
sacred
fire
of
devotion
and
loyalty
and
fine
courage
that
she
was
mutely
promising
joe
she
and
thousands
of
other
women
would
keep
alive
at
home
while
their
men
held
the
western
front
rilla
walked
away
realising
that
she
must
not
spy
on
such
a
moment
she
went
down
to
the
end
of
the
platform
where
sir
wilfrid
and
dog
monday
were
sitting
looking
at
each
other
sir
wilfrid
remarked
condescendingly
why
do
you
haunt
this
old
shed
when
you
might
lie
on
the
hearthrug
at
ingleside
and
live
on
the
fat
of
the
land
is
it
a
pose
or
a
fixed
idea
whereat
dog
monday
laconically
i
have
a
tryst
to
keep
when
the
train
had
gone
rilla
rejoined
the
little
trembling
miranda
well
he
gone
said
miranda
and
he
may
never
come
back
but
his
wife
and
i
going
to
be
worthy
of
him
i
going
home
do
you
think
you
had
better
come
with
me
now
asked
rilla
doubtfully
nobody
knew
yet
how
pryor
had
taken
the
matter
no
if
joe
can
face
the
huns
i
guess
i
can
face
father
said
miranda
daringly
a
soldier
wife
ca
be
a
coward
come
on
wilfy
i
go
straight
home
and
meet
the
worst
there
was
nothing
very
dreadful
to
face
however
perhaps
pryor
had
reflected
that
housekeepers
were
hard
to
get
and
that
there
were
many
milgrave
homes
open
to
miranda
also
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
separation
allowance
at
all
events
though
he
told
her
grumpily
that
she
had
made
a
nice
fool
of
herself
and
would
live
to
regret
it
he
said
nothing
worse
and
joe
put
on
her
apron
and
went
to
work
as
usual
while
sir
wilfrid
laurier
who
had
a
poor
opinion
of
lighthouses
for
winter
residences
went
to
sleep
in
his
pet
nook
behind
the
woodbox
a
thankful
dog
that
he
was
done
with
chapter
xix
they
shall
not
pass
one
cold
grey
morning
in
february
gertrude
oliver
wakened
with
a
shiver
slipped
into
rilla
room
and
crept
in
beside
her
rilla
i
frightened
frightened
as
a
baby
i
had
another
of
my
strange
dreams
something
terrible
is
before
us
i
know
what
was
it
asked
rilla
i
was
standing
again
on
the
veranda
steps
just
as
i
stood
in
that
dream
on
the
night
before
the
lighthouse
dance
and
in
the
sky
a
huge
black
menacing
thunder
cloud
rolled
up
from
the
east
i
could
see
its
shadow
racing
before
it
and
when
it
enveloped
me
i
shivered
with
icy
cold
then
the
storm
broke
and
it
was
a
dreadful
storm
blinding
flash
after
flash
and
deafening
peal
after
peal
driving
torrents
of
rain
i
turned
in
panic
and
tried
to
run
for
shelter
and
as
i
did
so
a
man
a
soldier
in
the
uniform
of
a
french
army
officer
dashed
up
the
steps
and
stood
beside
me
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
his
clothes
were
soaked
with
blood
from
a
wound
in
his
breast
he
seemed
spent
and
exhausted
but
his
white
face
was
set
and
his
eyes
blazed
in
his
hollow
face
shall
not
pass
he
said
in
low
passionate
tones
which
i
heard
distinctly
amid
all
the
turmoil
of
the
storm
then
i
awakened
rilla
i
frightened
the
spring
will
not
bring
the
big
push
we
all
been
hoping
for
instead
it
is
going
to
bring
some
dreadful
blow
to
france
i
am
sure
of
it
the
germans
will
try
to
smash
through
somewhere
but
he
told
you
that
they
would
not
pass
said
rilla
seriously
she
never
laughed
at
gertrude
dreams
as
the
doctor
did
i
do
not
know
if
that
was
prophecy
or
desperation
rilla
the
horror
of
that
dream
holds
me
yet
in
an
icy
grip
we
shall
need
all
our
courage
before
long
blythe
did
laugh
at
the
breakfast
table
but
he
never
laughed
at
miss
oliver
dreams
again
for
that
day
brought
news
of
the
opening
of
the
verdun
offensive
and
thereafter
through
all
the
beautiful
weeks
of
spring
the
ingleside
family
one
and
all
lived
in
a
trance
of
dread
there
were
days
when
they
waited
in
despair
for
the
end
as
foot
by
foot
the
germans
crept
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
grim
barrier
of
desperate
france
susan
deeds
were
in
her
spotless
kitchen
at
ingleside
but
her
thoughts
were
on
the
hills
around
verdun
dear
she
would
stick
her
head
in
at
blythe
door
the
last
thing
at
night
to
remark
i
do
hope
the
french
have
hung
onto
the
crow
wood
today
and
she
woke
at
dawn
to
wonder
if
dead
man
hill
surely
named
by
some
prophet
was
still
held
by
the
poyloos
susan
could
have
drawn
a
map
of
the
country
around
verdun
that
would
have
satisfied
a
chief
of
staff
if
the
germans
capture
verdun
the
spirit
of
france
will
be
broken
miss
oliver
said
bitterly
but
they
will
not
capture
it
staunchly
said
susan
who
could
not
eat
her
dinner
that
day
for
fear
lest
they
do
that
very
thing
in
the
first
place
you
dreamed
they
would
not
you
dreamed
the
very
thing
the
french
are
saying
before
they
ever
said
it
shall
not
pass
i
declare
to
you
miss
oliver
dear
when
i
read
that
in
the
paper
and
remembered
your
dream
i
went
cold
all
over
with
awe
it
seemed
to
me
like
biblical
times
when
people
dreamed
things
like
that
quite
frequently
i
know
i
know
said
gertrude
walking
restlessly
about
i
cling
to
a
persistent
faith
in
my
dream
too
but
every
time
bad
news
comes
it
fails
me
then
i
tell
myself
coincidence
and
so
forth
i
do
not
see
how
any
memory
could
remember
a
thing
before
it
was
ever
said
at
all
persisted
susan
though
of
course
i
am
not
educated
like
you
and
the
doctor
i
would
rather
not
be
if
it
makes
anything
as
simple
as
that
so
hard
to
believe
but
in
any
case
we
need
not
worry
over
verdun
even
if
the
huns
get
it
joffre
says
it
has
no
military
significance
that
old
sop
of
comfort
has
been
served
up
too
often
already
when
reverses
came
retorted
gertrude
it
has
lost
its
power
to
charm
was
there
ever
a
battle
like
this
in
the
world
before
said
meredith
one
evening
in
it
such
a
titanic
thing
we
ca
grasp
it
said
the
doctor
what
were
the
scraps
of
a
few
homeric
handfuls
compared
to
this
the
whole
trojan
war
might
be
fought
around
a
verdun
fort
and
a
newspaper
correspondent
would
give
it
no
more
than
a
sentence
i
am
not
in
the
confidence
of
the
occult
powers
the
doctor
threw
gertrude
a
twinkle
but
i
have
a
hunch
that
the
fate
of
the
whole
war
hangs
on
the
issue
of
verdun
as
susan
and
joffre
say
it
has
no
real
military
significance
but
it
has
the
tremendous
significance
of
an
idea
if
germany
wins
there
she
will
win
the
war
if
she
loses
the
tide
will
set
against
her
lose
she
will
said
meredith
emphatically
the
idea
can
not
be
conquered
france
is
certainly
very
wonderful
it
seems
to
me
that
in
her
i
see
the
white
form
of
civilization
making
a
determined
stand
against
the
black
powers
of
barbarism
i
think
our
whole
world
realizes
this
and
that
is
why
we
all
await
the
issue
so
breathlessly
it
merely
the
question
of
a
few
forts
changing
hands
or
a
few
miles
of
ground
lost
and
won
i
wonder
said
gertrude
dreamily
if
some
great
blessing
great
enough
for
the
price
will
be
the
meed
of
all
our
pain
is
the
agony
in
which
the
world
is
shuddering
the
of
some
wondrous
new
era
or
is
it
merely
a
futile
struggle
of
ants
in
the
gleam
of
a
million
million
of
suns
we
think
very
lightly
meredith
of
a
calamity
which
destroys
an
and
half
its
inhabitants
does
the
power
that
runs
the
universe
think
us
of
more
importance
than
we
think
ants
you
forget
said
meredith
with
a
flash
of
his
dark
eyes
that
an
infinite
power
must
be
infinitely
little
as
well
as
infinitely
great
we
are
neither
therefore
there
are
things
too
little
as
well
as
too
great
for
us
to
apprehend
to
the
infinitely
little
an
ant
is
of
as
much
importance
as
a
mastodon
we
are
witnessing
the
of
a
new
era
but
it
will
be
born
a
feeble
wailing
life
like
everything
else
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
expect
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
as
the
immediate
result
of
this
war
that
is
not
the
way
god
works
but
work
he
does
miss
oliver
and
in
the
end
his
purpose
will
be
fulfilled
sound
and
orthodox
sound
and
orthodox
muttered
susan
approvingly
in
the
kitchen
susan
liked
to
see
miss
oliver
sat
upon
by
the
minister
now
and
then
susan
was
very
fond
of
her
but
she
thought
miss
oliver
liked
saying
heretical
things
to
ministers
far
too
well
and
deserved
an
occasional
reminder
that
these
matters
were
quite
beyond
her
province
in
may
walter
wrote
home
that
he
had
been
awarded
a
medal
he
did
not
say
what
for
but
the
other
boys
took
care
that
the
glen
should
know
the
brave
thing
walter
had
done
in
any
war
but
this
wrote
jerry
meredith
it
would
have
meant
a
but
they
ca
make
as
common
as
the
brave
things
done
every
day
here
he
should
have
had
the
said
susan
and
was
very
indignant
over
it
she
was
not
quite
sure
who
was
to
blame
for
his
not
getting
it
but
if
it
were
general
haig
she
began
for
the
first
time
to
entertain
serious
doubts
as
to
his
fitness
for
being
rilla
was
beside
herself
with
delight
it
was
her
dear
walter
who
had
done
this
thing
walter
to
whom
someone
had
sent
a
white
feather
at
redmond
it
was
walter
who
had
dashed
back
from
the
safety
of
the
trench
to
drag
in
a
wounded
comrade
who
had
fallen
on
oh
she
could
see
his
white
beautiful
face
and
wonderful
eyes
as
he
did
it
what
a
thing
to
be
the
sister
of
such
a
hero
and
he
had
thought
it
worth
while
writing
about
his
letter
was
full
of
other
things
little
intimate
things
that
they
two
had
known
and
loved
together
in
the
dear
old
cloudless
days
of
a
century
ago
i
been
thinking
of
the
daffodils
in
the
garden
at
ingleside
he
wrote
by
the
time
you
get
this
they
will
be
out
blowing
there
under
that
lovely
rosy
sky
are
they
really
as
bright
and
golden
as
ever
rilla
it
seems
to
me
that
they
must
be
dyed
red
with
blood
like
our
poppies
here
and
every
whisper
of
spring
will
be
falling
as
a
violet
in
rainbow
valley
there
is
a
young
moon
tonight
a
slender
silver
lovely
thing
hanging
over
these
pits
of
torment
will
you
see
it
tonight
over
the
maple
grove
i
enclosing
a
little
scrap
of
verse
rilla
i
wrote
it
one
evening
in
my
trench
by
the
light
of
a
bit
of
candle
or
rather
it
came
to
me
there
i
did
feel
as
if
i
were
writing
it
something
seemed
to
use
me
as
an
instrument
i
had
that
feeling
once
or
twice
before
but
very
rarely
and
never
so
strongly
as
this
time
that
was
why
i
sent
it
over
to
the
london
spectator
it
printed
it
and
the
copy
came
today
i
hope
you
like
it
it
the
only
poem
i
written
since
i
came
overseas
the
poem
was
a
short
poignant
little
thing
in
a
month
it
had
carried
walter
name
to
every
corner
of
the
globe
everywhere
it
was
copied
in
metropolitan
dailies
and
little
village
weeklies
in
profound
reviews
and
agony
columns
in
red
cross
appeals
and
government
recruiting
propaganda
mothers
and
sisters
wept
over
it
young
lads
thrilled
to
it
the
whole
great
heart
of
humanity
caught
it
up
as
an
epitome
of
all
the
pain
and
hope
and
pity
and
purpose
of
the
mighty
conflict
crystallized
in
three
brief
immortal
verses
a
canadian
lad
in
the
flanders
trenches
had
written
the
one
great
poem
of
the
war
the
piper
by
pte
walter
blythe
was
a
classic
from
its
first
printing
rilla
copied
it
in
her
diary
at
the
beginning
of
an
entry
in
which
she
poured
out
the
story
of
the
hard
week
that
had
just
passed
it
has
been
such
a
dreadful
week
she
wrote
and
even
though
it
is
over
and
we
know
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
that
does
not
seem
to
do
away
with
the
bruises
left
by
it
and
yet
it
has
in
some
ways
been
a
very
wonderful
week
and
i
have
had
some
glimpses
of
things
i
never
realized
before
of
how
fine
and
brave
people
can
be
even
in
the
midst
of
horrible
suffering
i
am
sure
i
could
never
be
as
splendid
as
miss
oliver
was
just
a
week
ago
today
she
had
a
letter
from
grant
mother
in
charlottetown
and
it
told
her
that
a
cable
had
just
come
saying
that
major
robert
grant
had
been
killed
in
action
a
few
days
before
oh
poor
gertrude
at
first
she
was
crushed
then
after
just
a
day
she
pulled
herself
together
and
went
back
to
her
school
she
did
not
cry
i
never
saw
her
shed
a
tear
but
oh
her
face
and
her
eyes
must
go
on
with
my
work
she
said
is
my
duty
just
now
i
could
never
have
risen
to
such
a
height
she
never
spoke
bitterly
except
once
when
susan
said
something
about
spring
being
here
at
last
and
gertrude
said
the
spring
really
come
this
year
then
she
laughed
such
a
dreadful
little
laugh
just
as
one
might
laugh
in
the
face
of
death
i
think
and
said
my
egotism
because
i
gertrude
oliver
have
lost
a
friend
it
is
incredible
that
the
spring
can
come
as
usual
the
spring
does
not
fail
because
of
the
million
agonies
of
others
but
for
mine
oh
can
the
universe
go
on
feel
bitter
with
yourself
dear
mother
said
gently
is
a
very
natural
thing
to
feel
as
if
things
could
go
on
just
the
same
when
some
great
blow
has
changed
the
world
for
us
we
all
feel
like
that
then
that
horrid
old
cousin
sophia
of
susan
piped
up
she
was
sitting
there
knitting
and
croaking
like
an
old
of
bode
and
woe
as
walter
used
to
call
her
ai
as
bad
off
as
some
miss
oliver
she
said
you
should
take
it
so
hard
there
some
as
has
lost
their
husbands
that
a
hard
blow
and
there
some
as
has
lost
their
sons
you
have
lost
either
husband
or
son
said
gertrude
more
bitterly
still
true
i
have
lost
a
husband
i
have
only
lost
the
man
who
would
have
been
my
husband
i
have
lost
no
son
only
the
sons
and
daughters
who
might
have
been
born
to
me
who
will
never
be
born
to
me
now
is
ladylike
to
talk
like
that
said
cousin
sophia
in
a
shocked
tone
and
then
gertrude
laughed
right
out
so
wildly
that
cousin
sophia
was
really
frightened
and
when
poor
tortured
gertrude
unable
to
endure
it
any
longer
hurried
out
of
the
room
cousin
sophia
asked
mother
if
the
blow
had
affected
miss
oliver
mind
suffered
the
loss
of
two
good
kind
partners
she
said
it
did
not
affect
me
like
that
i
should
think
it
would
those
poor
men
must
have
been
thankful
to
die
i
heard
gertrude
walking
up
and
down
her
room
most
of
the
night
she
walked
like
that
every
night
but
never
so
long
as
that
night
and
once
i
heard
her
give
a
dreadful
sudden
little
cry
as
if
she
had
been
stabbed
i
could
sleep
for
suffering
with
her
and
i
could
help
her
i
thought
the
night
would
never
end
but
it
did
and
then
came
in
the
morning
as
the
bible
says
only
it
did
come
exactly
in
the
morning
but
well
along
in
the
afternoon
the
telephone
rang
and
i
answered
it
it
was
old
grant
speaking
from
charlottetown
and
her
news
was
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
robert
was
killed
at
all
he
had
only
been
slightly
wounded
in
the
arm
and
was
safe
in
the
hospital
out
of
harm
way
for
a
time
anyhow
they
had
learned
yet
how
the
mistake
had
happened
but
supposed
there
must
have
been
another
robert
grant
i
hung
up
the
telephone
and
flew
to
rainbow
valley
i
sure
i
did
fly
i
ca
remember
my
feet
ever
touching
the
ground
i
met
gertrude
on
her
way
home
from
school
in
the
glade
of
spruces
where
we
used
to
play
and
i
just
gasped
out
the
news
to
her
i
ought
to
have
had
more
sense
of
course
but
i
was
so
crazy
with
joy
and
excitement
that
i
never
stopped
to
think
gertrude
just
dropped
there
among
the
golden
young
ferns
as
if
she
had
been
shot
the
fright
it
gave
me
ought
to
make
me
sensible
in
this
respect
at
least
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
thought
i
had
killed
her
i
remembered
that
her
mother
had
died
very
suddenly
from
heart
failure
when
quite
a
young
woman
it
seemed
years
to
me
before
i
discovered
that
her
heart
was
still
beating
a
pretty
time
i
had
i
never
saw
anybody
faint
before
and
i
knew
there
was
nobody
up
at
the
house
to
help
because
everybody
else
had
gone
to
the
station
to
meet
di
and
nan
coming
home
from
redmond
but
i
knew
theoretically
how
people
in
a
faint
should
be
treated
and
now
i
know
it
practically
luckily
the
brook
was
handy
and
after
i
had
worked
frantically
over
her
for
a
while
gertrude
came
back
to
life
she
never
said
one
word
about
my
news
and
i
did
dare
to
refer
to
it
again
i
helped
her
walk
up
through
the
maple
grove
and
up
to
her
room
and
then
she
said
is
living
as
if
the
words
were
torn
out
of
her
and
flung
herself
on
her
bed
and
cried
and
cried
and
cried
i
never
saw
anyone
cry
so
before
all
the
tears
that
she
had
shed
all
that
week
came
then
she
cried
most
of
last
night
i
think
but
her
face
this
morning
looked
as
if
she
had
seen
a
vision
of
some
kind
and
we
were
all
so
happy
that
we
were
almost
afraid
di
and
nan
are
home
for
a
couple
of
weeks
then
they
go
back
to
red
cross
work
in
the
training
camp
at
kingsport
i
envy
them
father
says
i
doing
just
as
good
work
here
with
jims
and
my
junior
reds
but
it
lacks
the
romance
theirs
must
have
kut
has
fallen
it
was
almost
a
relief
when
it
did
fall
we
had
been
dreading
it
so
long
it
crushed
us
flat
for
a
day
and
then
we
picked
up
and
put
it
behind
us
cousin
sophia
was
as
gloomy
as
usual
and
came
over
and
groaned
that
the
british
were
losing
everywhere
good
losers
said
susan
grimly
they
lose
a
thing
they
keep
on
looking
till
they
find
it
again
anyhow
my
king
and
country
need
me
now
to
cut
potato
sets
for
the
back
garden
so
get
you
a
knife
and
help
me
sophia
crawford
it
will
divert
your
thoughts
and
keep
you
from
worrying
over
a
campaign
that
you
are
not
called
upon
to
run
susan
is
an
old
brick
and
the
way
she
flattens
out
poor
cousin
sophia
is
beautiful
to
behold
as
for
verdun
the
battle
goes
on
and
on
and
we
between
hope
and
fear
but
i
know
that
strange
dream
of
miss
oliver
foretold
the
victory
of
france

not
pass
chapter
xx
norman
douglas
speaks
out
in
meeting
where
are
you
wandering
anne
o
mine
asked
the
doctor
who
even
yet
after
years
of
marriage
occasionally
addressed
his
wife
thus
when
nobody
was
about
anne
was
sitting
on
the
veranda
steps
gazing
absently
over
the
wonderful
bridal
world
of
spring
blossom
beyond
the
white
orchard
was
a
copse
of
dark
young
firs
and
creamy
wild
cherries
where
the
robins
were
whistling
madly
for
it
was
evening
and
the
fire
of
early
stars
was
burning
over
the
maple
grove
anne
came
back
with
a
little
sigh
i
was
just
taking
relief
from
intolerable
realities
in
a
dream
gilbert
a
dream
that
all
our
children
were
home
again
and
all
small
again
playing
in
rainbow
valley
it
is
always
so
silent
now
but
i
was
imagining
i
heard
clear
voices
and
gay
childish
sounds
coming
up
as
i
used
to
i
could
hear
jem
whistle
and
walter
yodel
and
the
laughter
and
for
just
a
few
blessed
minutes
i
forgot
about
the
guns
on
the
western
front
and
had
a
little
false
sweet
happiness
the
doctor
did
not
answer
sometimes
his
work
tricked
him
into
forgetting
for
a
few
moments
the
western
front
but
not
often
there
was
a
good
deal
of
grey
now
in
his
still
thick
curls
that
had
not
been
there
two
years
ago
yet
he
smiled
down
into
the
starry
eyes
he
loved
the
eyes
that
had
once
been
so
full
of
laughter
and
now
seemed
always
full
of
unshed
tears
susan
wandered
by
with
a
hoe
in
her
hand
and
her
second
best
bonnet
on
her
head
i
have
just
finished
reading
a
piece
in
the
enterprise
which
told
of
a
couple
being
married
in
an
aeroplane
do
you
think
it
would
be
legal
doctor
dear
she
inquired
anxiously
i
think
so
said
the
doctor
gravely
well
said
susan
dubiously
it
seems
to
me
that
a
wedding
is
too
solemn
for
anything
so
giddy
as
an
aeroplane
but
nothing
is
the
same
as
it
used
to
be
well
it
is
half
an
hour
yet
before
time
so
i
am
going
around
to
the
kitchen
garden
to
have
a
little
evening
hate
with
the
weeds
but
all
the
time
i
am
strafing
them
i
will
be
thinking
about
this
new
worry
in
the
trentino
i
do
not
like
this
austrian
caper
dr
dear
nor
i
said
blythe
ruefully
all
the
forenoon
i
preserved
rhubarb
with
my
hands
and
waited
for
the
war
news
with
my
soul
when
it
came
i
shrivelled
well
i
suppose
i
must
go
and
get
ready
for
the
too
every
village
has
its
own
little
unwritten
history
handed
down
from
lip
to
lip
through
the
generations
of
tragic
comic
and
dramatic
events
they
are
told
at
weddings
and
festivals
and
rehearsed
around
winter
firesides
and
in
these
oral
annals
of
glen
mary
the
tale
of
the
union
held
that
night
in
the
methodist
church
was
destined
to
fill
an
imperishable
place
the
union
was
arnold
idea
the
county
battalion
which
had
been
training
all
winter
in
charlottetown
was
to
leave
shortly
for
overseas
the
four
winds
harbour
boys
belonging
to
it
from
the
glen
and
and
harbour
head
and
upper
glen
were
all
home
on
their
last
leave
and
arnold
thought
properly
enough
that
it
would
be
a
fitting
thing
to
hold
a
union
for
them
before
they
went
away
meredith
having
agreed
the
meeting
was
announced
to
be
held
in
the
methodist
church
glen
were
not
apt
to
be
too
well
attended
but
on
this
particular
evening
the
methodist
church
was
crowded
everybody
who
could
go
was
there
even
miss
cornelia
came
and
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
miss
cornelia
had
ever
set
foot
inside
a
methodist
church
it
took
no
less
than
a
world
conflict
to
bring
that
about
i
used
to
hate
methodists
said
miss
cornelia
calmly
when
her
husband
expressed
surprise
over
her
going
but
i
do
hate
them
now
there
is
no
sense
in
hating
methodists
when
there
is
a
kaiser
or
a
hindenburg
in
the
world
so
miss
cornelia
went
norman
douglas
and
his
wife
went
too
and
strutted
up
the
aisle
to
a
front
pew
as
if
he
fully
realized
what
a
distinction
he
conferred
upon
the
building
people
were
somewhat
surprised
that
he
should
be
there
since
he
usually
avoided
all
assemblages
connected
in
any
way
with
the
war
but
meredith
had
said
that
he
hoped
his
session
would
be
well
represented
and
pryor
had
evidently
taken
the
request
to
heart
he
wore
his
best
black
suit
and
white
tie
his
thick
tight
curls
were
neatly
arranged
and
his
broad
red
round
face
looked
as
susan
most
uncharitably
thought
more
sanctimonious
than
ever
the
minute
i
saw
that
man
coming
into
the
church
looking
like
that
i
felt
that
mischief
was
brewing
dear
she
said
afterwards
what
form
it
would
take
i
could
not
tell
but
i
knew
from
face
of
him
that
he
had
come
there
for
no
good
the
opened
conventionally
and
continued
quietly
meredith
spoke
first
with
his
usual
eloquence
and
feeling
arnold
followed
with
an
address
which
even
miss
cornelia
had
to
confess
was
irreproachable
in
taste
and
and
then
arnold
asked
pryor
to
lead
in
prayer
miss
cornelia
had
always
averred
that
arnold
had
no
gumption
miss
cornelia
was
not
apt
to
err
on
the
side
of
charity
in
her
judgment
of
methodist
ministers
but
in
this
case
she
did
not
greatly
overshoot
the
mark
the
rev
arnold
certainly
did
not
have
much
of
that
desirable
indefinable
quality
known
as
gumption
or
he
would
never
have
asked
to
lead
in
prayer
at
a
khaki
he
thought
he
was
returning
the
compliment
to
meredith
who
at
the
conclusion
of
his
address
had
asked
a
methodist
deacon
to
lead
some
people
expected
pryor
to
refuse
grumpily
and
that
would
have
made
enough
scandal
but
pryor
bounded
briskly
to
his
feet
unctuously
said
let
us
pray
and
forthwith
prayed
in
a
sonorous
voice
which
penetrated
to
every
corner
of
the
crowded
building
pryor
poured
forth
a
flood
of
fluent
words
and
was
well
on
in
his
prayer
before
his
dazed
and
horrified
audience
awakened
to
the
fact
that
they
were
listening
to
a
pacifist
appeal
of
the
rankest
sort
pryor
had
at
least
the
courage
of
his
convictions
or
perhaps
as
people
afterwards
said
he
thought
he
was
safe
in
a
church
and
that
it
was
an
excellent
chance
to
air
certain
opinions
he
dared
not
voice
elsewhere
for
fear
of
being
mobbed
he
prayed
that
the
unholy
war
might
cease
that
the
deluded
armies
being
driven
to
slaughter
on
the
western
front
might
have
their
eyes
opened
to
their
iniquity
and
repent
while
yet
there
was
time
that
the
poor
young
men
present
in
khaki
who
had
been
hounded
into
a
path
of
murder
and
militarism
should
yet
be
rescued
pryor
had
got
this
far
without
let
or
hindrance
and
so
paralysed
were
his
hearers
and
so
deeply
imbued
with
their
conviction
that
no
disturbance
must
ever
be
made
in
a
church
no
matter
what
the
provocation
that
it
seemed
likely
that
he
would
continue
unchecked
to
the
end
but
one
man
at
least
in
that
audience
was
not
hampered
by
inherited
or
acquired
reverence
for
the
sacred
edifice
norman
douglas
was
as
susan
had
often
vowed
crisply
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
pagan
but
he
was
a
rampantly
patriotic
pagan
and
when
the
significance
of
what
pryor
was
saying
fully
dawned
on
him
norman
douglas
suddenly
went
berserk
with
a
positive
roar
he
bounded
to
his
feet
in
his
side
pew
facing
the
audience
and
shouted
in
tones
of
thunder
stop
stop
stop
that
abominable
prayer
what
an
abominable
prayer
every
head
in
the
church
flew
up
a
boy
in
khaki
at
the
back
gave
a
faint
cheer
meredith
raised
a
deprecating
hand
but
norman
was
past
caring
for
anything
like
that
eluding
his
wife
restraining
grasp
he
gave
one
mad
spring
over
the
front
of
the
pew
and
caught
the
unfortunate
by
his
coat
collar
pryor
had
not
stopped
when
so
bidden
but
he
stopped
now
perforce
for
norman
his
long
red
beard
literally
bristling
with
fury
was
shaking
him
until
his
bones
fairly
rattled
and
punctuating
his
shakes
with
a
lurid
assortment
of
abusive
epithets
you
blatant
beast
shake
you
malignant
carrion
shake
you
varmint
shake
you
putrid
pup
shake
you
pestilential
parasite
shake
you
hunnish
scum
shake
you
indecent
reptile
you
you
norman
choked
for
a
moment
everybody
believed
that
the
next
thing
he
would
say
church
or
no
church
would
be
something
that
would
have
to
be
spelt
with
asterisks
but
at
that
moment
norman
encountered
his
wife
eye
and
he
fell
back
with
a
thud
on
holy
writ
you
whited
sepulchre
he
bellowed
with
a
final
shake
and
cast
from
him
with
a
vigour
which
impelled
that
unhappy
pacifist
to
the
very
verge
of
the
choir
entrance
door
pryor
once
ruddy
face
was
ashen
but
he
turned
at
bay
i
have
the
law
on
you
for
this
he
gasped
do
do
roared
norman
making
another
rush
but
pryor
was
gone
he
had
no
desire
to
fall
a
second
time
into
the
hands
of
an
avenging
militarist
norman
turned
to
the
platform
for
one
graceless
triumphant
moment
do
look
so
flabbergasted
parsons
he
boomed
you
could
do
it
nobody
would
expect
it
of
the
cloth
but
somebody
had
to
do
it
you
know
you
glad
i
threw
him
out
he
could
be
let
go
on
yammering
and
yodelling
and
yawping
sedition
and
treason
sedition
and
treason
somebody
had
to
deal
with
it
i
was
born
for
this
hour
had
my
innings
in
church
at
last
i
can
sit
quiet
for
another
sixty
years
now
go
ahead
with
your
meeting
parsons
i
reckon
you
wo
be
troubled
with
any
more
pacifist
prayers
but
the
spirit
of
devotion
and
reverence
had
fled
both
ministers
realized
it
and
realized
that
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
close
the
meeting
quietly
and
let
the
excited
people
go
meredith
addressed
a
few
earnest
words
to
the
boys
in
khaki
which
probably
saved
pryor
windows
from
a
second
onslaught
and
arnold
pronounced
an
incongruous
benediction
at
least
he
felt
it
was
incongruous
for
he
could
not
at
once
banish
from
his
memory
the
sight
of
gigantic
norman
douglas
shaking
the
fat
pompous
little
as
a
huge
mastiff
might
shake
an
overgrown
puppy
and
he
knew
that
the
same
picture
was
in
everybody
mind
altogether
the
union
could
hardly
be
called
an
unqualified
success
but
it
was
remembered
in
glen
mary
when
scores
of
orthodox
and
undisturbed
assemblies
were
totally
forgotten
you
will
never
no
never
dear
hear
me
call
norman
douglas
a
pagan
again
said
susan
when
she
reached
home
if
ellen
douglas
is
not
a
proud
woman
this
night
she
should
be
norman
douglas
did
a
wholly
indefensible
thing
said
the
doctor
pryor
should
have
been
let
severely
alone
until
the
meeting
was
over
then
later
on
his
own
minister
and
session
should
deal
with
him
that
would
have
been
the
proper
procedure
norman
performance
was
utterly
improper
and
scandalous
and
outrageous
but
by
george
the
doctor
threw
back
his
head
and
chuckled
by
george
it
was
satisfying

good
and
bad
that
i
have
had
time
and
composure
to
write
in
my
diary
for
weeks
i
like
to
keep
it
up
regularly
for
father
says
a
diary
of
the
years
of
the
war
should
be
a
very
interesting
thing
to
hand
down
to
one
children
the
trouble
is
i
like
to
write
a
few
personal
things
in
this
blessed
old
book
that
might
not
be
exactly
what
i
want
my
children
to
read
i
feel
that
i
shall
be
a
far
greater
stickler
for
propriety
in
regard
to
them
than
i
am
for
myself
the
first
week
in
june
was
another
dreadful
one
the
austrians
seemed
just
on
the
point
of
overrunning
italy
and
then
came
the
first
awful
news
of
the
battle
of
jutland
which
the
germans
claimed
as
a
great
victory
susan
was
the
only
one
who
carried
on
need
never
tell
me
that
the
kaiser
has
defeated
the
british
navy
she
said
with
a
contemptuous
sniff
is
all
a
german
lie
and
that
you
may
tie
to
and
when
a
couple
of
days
later
we
found
out
that
she
was
right
and
that
it
had
been
a
british
victory
instead
of
a
british
defeat
we
had
to
put
up
with
a
great
many
told
you
so
but
we
endured
them
very
comfortably
it
took
kitchener
death
to
finish
susan
for
the
first
time
i
saw
her
down
and
out
we
all
felt
the
shock
of
it
but
susan
plumbed
the
depths
of
despair
the
news
came
at
night
by
but
susan
believe
it
until
she
saw
the
enterprise
headline
the
next
day
she
did
not
cry
or
faint
or
go
into
hysterics
but
she
forgot
to
put
salt
in
the
soup
and
that
is
something
susan
never
did
in
my
recollection
mother
and
miss
oliver
and
i
cried
but
susan
looked
at
us
in
stony
sarcasm
and
said
kaiser
and
his
six
sons
are
all
alive
and
thriving
so
the
world
is
not
left
wholly
desolate
why
cry
dr
dear
susan
continued
in
this
stony
hopeless
condition
for
hours
and
then
cousin
sophia
appeared
and
began
to
condole
with
her
is
terrible
news
ai
it
susan
we
might
as
well
prepare
for
the
worst
for
it
is
bound
to
come
you
said
once
and
well
do
i
remember
the
words
susan
baker
that
you
had
complete
confidence
in
god
and
kitchener
ah
well
susan
baker
there
is
only
god
left
now
whereat
cousin
sophia
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
pathetically
as
if
the
world
were
indeed
in
terrible
straits
as
for
susan
cousin
sophia
was
the
salvation
of
her
she
came
to
life
with
a
jerk
crawford
hold
your
peace
she
said
sternly
may
be
an
idiot
but
you
need
not
be
an
irreverent
idiot
it
is
no
more
than
decent
to
be
weeping
and
wailing
because
the
almighty
is
the
sole
stay
of
the
allies
now
as
for
kitchener
his
death
is
a
great
loss
and
i
do
not
dispute
it
but
the
outcome
of
this
war
does
not
depend
on
one
man
life
and
now
that
the
russians
are
coming
on
again
you
will
soon
see
a
change
for
the
better
susan
said
this
so
energetically
that
she
convinced
herself
and
cheered
up
immediately
but
cousin
sophia
shook
her
head
wife
wants
to
call
the
baby
after
brusiloff
she
said
i
told
her
to
wait
and
see
what
becomes
of
him
first
them
russians
has
such
a
habit
of
petering
out
the
russians
are
doing
splendidly
however
and
they
have
saved
italy
but
even
when
the
daily
news
of
their
sweeping
advance
comes
we
feel
like
running
up
the
flag
as
we
used
to
do
as
gertrude
says
verdun
has
slain
all
exultation
we
would
all
feel
more
like
rejoicing
if
the
victories
were
on
the
western
front
will
the
british
strike
gertrude
sighed
this
morning
have
waited
so
long
so
long
our
greatest
local
event
in
recent
weeks
was
the
route
march
the
county
battalion
made
through
the
county
before
it
left
for
overseas
they
marched
from
charlottetown
to
lowbridge
then
round
the
harbour
head
and
through
the
upper
glen
and
so
down
to
the
mary
station
everybody
turned
out
to
see
them
except
old
aunt
fannie
clow
who
is
bedridden
and
pryor
who
had
been
seen
out
even
in
church
since
the
night
of
the
union
prayer
meeting
the
previous
week
it
was
wonderful
and
heartbreaking
to
see
that
battalion
marching
past
there
were
young
men
and
men
in
it
there
was
laurie
mcallister
from
who
is
only
sixteen
but
swore
he
was
eighteen
so
that
he
could
enlist
and
there
was
angus
mackenzie
from
the
upper
glen
who
is
if
he
is
a
day
and
swore
he
was
there
were
two
south
african
veterans
from
lowbridge
and
the
three
baxter
triplets
from
harbour
head
everybody
cheered
as
they
went
by
and
they
cheered
foster
booth
who
is
forty
walking
side
by
side
with
his
son
charley
who
is
twenty
charley
mother
died
when
he
was
born
and
when
charley
enlisted
foster
said
he
never
yet
let
charley
go
anywhere
he
dare
go
himself
and
he
did
mean
to
begin
with
the
flanders
trenches
at
the
station
dog
monday
nearly
went
out
of
his
head
he
tore
about
and
sent
messages
to
jem
by
them
all
meredith
read
an
address
and
reta
crawford
recited
piper
the
soldiers
cheered
her
like
mad
and
cried
follow
we
follow
we
wo
break
faith
and
i
felt
so
proud
to
think
that
it
was
my
dear
brother
who
had
written
such
a
wonderful
thing
and
then
i
looked
at
the
khaki
ranks
and
wondered
if
those
tall
fellows
in
uniform
could
be
the
boys
laughed
with
and
played
with
and
danced
with
and
teased
all
my
life
something
seems
to
have
touched
them
and
set
them
apart
they
have
heard
the
piper
call
fred
arnold
was
in
the
battalion
and
i
felt
dreadfully
about
him
for
i
realized
that
it
was
because
of
me
that
he
was
going
away
with
such
a
sorrowful
expression
i
could
help
it
but
i
felt
as
badly
as
if
i
could
the
last
evening
of
his
leave
fred
came
up
to
ingleside
and
told
me
he
loved
me
and
asked
me
if
i
would
promise
to
marry
him
some
day
if
he
ever
came
back
he
was
desperately
in
earnest
and
i
felt
more
wretched
than
i
ever
did
in
my
life
i
could
promise
him
that
why
even
if
there
was
no
question
of
ken
i
do
care
for
fred
that
way
and
never
could
but
it
seemed
so
cruel
and
heartless
to
send
him
away
to
the
front
without
any
hope
of
comfort
i
cried
like
a
baby
and
yet
oh
i
am
afraid
that
there
must
be
something
incurably
frivolous
about
me
because
right
in
the
middle
of
it
all
with
me
crying
and
fred
looking
so
wild
and
tragic
the
thought
popped
into
my
head
that
it
would
be
an
unendurable
thing
to
see
that
nose
across
from
me
at
the
breakfast
table
every
morning
of
my
life
there
that
is
one
of
the
entries
i
would
want
my
descendants
to
read
in
this
journal
but
it
is
the
humiliating
truth
and
perhaps
it
just
as
well
that
thought
did
come
or
i
might
have
been
tricked
by
pity
and
remorse
into
giving
him
some
rash
assurance
if
fred
nose
were
as
handsome
as
his
eyes
and
mouth
some
such
thing
might
have
happened
and
then
what
an
unthinkable
predicament
i
should
have
been
in
when
poor
fred
became
convinced
that
i
could
promise
him
he
behaved
beautifully
though
that
rather
made
things
worse
if
he
had
been
nasty
about
it
i
would
have
felt
so
heartbroken
and
remorseful
though
why
i
should
feel
remorseful
i
do
know
for
i
never
encouraged
fred
to
think
i
cared
a
bit
about
him
yet
feel
remorseful
i
did
and
do
if
fred
arnold
never
comes
back
from
overseas
this
will
haunt
me
all
my
life
then
fred
said
if
he
could
take
my
love
with
him
to
the
trenches
at
least
he
wanted
to
feel
that
he
had
my
friendship
and
would
i
kiss
him
just
once
in
before
he
went
perhaps
for
ever
i
do
know
how
i
could
ever
had
imagined
that
love
affairs
were
delightful
interesting
things
they
are
horrible
i
could
even
give
poor
heartbroken
fred
one
little
kiss
because
of
my
promise
to
ken
it
seemed
so
brutal
i
had
to
tell
fred
that
of
course
he
would
have
my
friendship
but
that
i
could
kiss
him
because
i
had
promised
somebody
else
i
would
he
said
is
is
it
ken
ford
i
nodded
it
seemed
dreadful
to
have
to
tell
it
it
was
such
a
sacred
little
secret
just
between
me
and
ken
when
fred
went
away
i
came
up
here
to
my
room
and
cried
so
long
and
so
bitterly
that
mother
came
up
and
insisted
on
knowing
what
was
the
matter
i
told
her
she
listened
to
my
tale
with
an
expression
that
clearly
said
it
be
possible
that
anyone
has
been
wanting
to
marry
this
baby
but
she
was
so
nice
and
understanding
and
sympathetic
oh
just
so
that
i
felt
indescribably
comforted
mothers
are
the
dearest
things
oh
mother
i
sobbed
wanted
me
to
kiss
him
and
i
could
and
that
hurt
me
worse
than
all
the
rest
why
did
you
kiss
him
asked
mother
coolly
the
circumstances
i
think
you
might
have
i
could
mother
i
promised
ken
when
he
went
away
that
i
would
kiss
anybody
else
until
he
came
back
this
was
another
high
explosive
for
poor
mother
she
exclaimed
with
the
queerest
little
catch
in
her
voice
are
you
engaged
to
kenneth
ford
do
know
i
sobbed
do
know
repeated
mother
then
i
had
to
tell
her
the
whole
story
too
and
every
time
i
tell
it
it
seems
sillier
and
sillier
to
imagine
that
ken
meant
anything
serious
i
felt
idiotic
and
ashamed
by
the
time
i
got
through
mother
sat
a
little
while
in
silence
then
she
came
over
sat
down
beside
me
and
took
me
in
her
arms
cry
dear
little
you
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
with
in
regard
to
fred
and
if
leslie
west
son
asked
you
to
keep
your
lips
for
him
i
think
you
may
consider
yourself
engaged
to
him
but
oh
my
baby
my
last
little
baby
i
have
lost
you
the
war
has
made
a
woman
of
you
too
soon
i
shall
never
be
too
much
of
a
woman
to
find
comfort
in
mother
hugs
nevertheless
when
i
saw
fred
marching
by
two
days
later
in
the
parade
my
heart
ached
unbearably
but
i
glad
mother
thinks
i
really
engaged
to
ken
chapter
xxii
little
dog
monday
knows
it
is
two
years
tonight
since
the
dance
at
the
light
when
jack
elliott
brought
us
news
of
the
war
do
you
remember
miss
oliver
cousin
sophia
answered
for
miss
oliver
oh
indeed
rilla
i
remember
that
evening
only
too
well
and
you
down
here
to
show
off
your
party
clothes
did
i
warn
you
that
we
could
not
tell
what
was
before
us
little
did
you
think
that
night
what
was
before
you
little
did
any
of
us
think
that
said
susan
sharply
not
being
gifted
with
the
power
of
prophecy
it
does
not
require
any
great
foresight
sophia
crawford
to
tell
a
body
that
she
will
have
some
trouble
before
her
life
is
over
i
could
do
as
much
myself
we
all
thought
the
war
would
be
over
in
a
few
months
then
said
rilla
wistfully
when
i
look
back
it
seems
so
ridiculous
that
we
ever
could
have
supposed
it
and
now
two
years
later
it
is
no
nearer
the
end
than
it
was
then
said
miss
oliver
gloomily
susan
clicked
her
briskly
now
miss
oliver
dear
you
know
that
is
not
a
reasonable
remark
you
know
we
are
just
two
years
nearer
the
end
whenever
the
end
is
appointed
to
be
albert
read
in
a
montreal
paper
today
that
a
war
expert
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
it
will
last
five
years
more
was
cousin
cheerful
contribution
it
ca
cried
rilla
then
she
added
with
a
sigh
two
years
ago
we
would
have
said
ca
last
two
years
but
five
more
years
of
this
if
rumania
comes
in
as
i
have
strong
hopes
now
of
her
doing
you
will
see
the
end
in
five
months
instead
of
five
years
said
susan
i
no
faith
in
furriners
sighed
cousin
sophia
the
french
are
foreigners
retorted
susan
and
look
at
verdun
and
think
of
all
the
somme
victories
this
blessed
summer
the
big
push
is
on
and
the
russians
are
still
going
well
why
general
haig
says
that
the
german
officers
he
has
captured
admit
that
they
have
lost
the
war
you
ca
believe
a
word
the
germans
say
protested
cousin
sophia
there
is
no
sense
in
believing
a
thing
just
because
you
like
to
believe
it
susan
baker
the
british
have
lost
millions
of
men
at
the
somme
and
how
far
have
they
got
look
facts
in
the
face
susan
baker
look
facts
in
the
face
they
are
wearing
the
germans
out
and
so
long
as
that
happens
it
does
not
matter
whether
it
is
done
a
few
miles
east
or
a
few
miles
west
i
am
not
admitted
susan
in
tremendous
humility
i
am
not
a
military
expert
sophia
crawford
but
even
i
can
see
that
and
so
could
you
if
you
were
not
determined
to
take
a
gloomy
view
of
everything
the
huns
have
not
got
all
the
cleverness
in
the
world
have
you
not
heard
the
story
of
alistair
maccallum
son
roderick
from
the
upper
glen
he
is
a
prisoner
in
germany
and
his
mother
got
a
letter
from
him
last
week
he
wrote
that
he
was
being
very
kindly
treated
and
that
all
the
prisoners
had
plenty
of
food
and
so
on
till
you
would
have
supposed
everything
was
lovely
but
when
he
signed
his
name
right
in
between
roderick
and
maccallum
he
wrote
two
gaelic
words
that
meant
and
the
german
censor
did
not
understand
gaelic
and
thought
it
was
all
part
of
roddy
name
so
he
let
it
pass
never
dreaming
how
he
was
diddled
well
i
am
going
to
leave
the
war
to
haig
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
make
a
frosting
for
my
chocolate
cake
and
when
it
is
made
i
shall
put
it
on
the
top
shelf
the
last
one
i
made
i
left
it
on
the
lower
shelf
and
little
kitchener
sneaked
in
and
clawed
all
the
icing
off
and
ate
it
we
had
company
for
tea
that
night
and
when
i
went
to
get
my
cake
what
a
sight
did
i
behold
has
that
pore
orphan
father
never
been
heerd
from
yet
asked
cousin
sophia
yes
i
had
a
letter
from
him
in
july
said
rilla
he
said
that
when
he
got
word
of
his
wife
death
and
of
my
taking
the
baby
meredith
wrote
him
you
know
he
wrote
right
away
but
as
he
never
got
any
answer
he
had
begun
to
think
his
letter
must
have
been
lost
it
took
him
two
years
to
begin
to
think
it
said
susan
scornfully
some
people
think
very
slow
jim
anderson
has
not
got
a
scratch
for
all
he
has
been
two
years
in
the
trenches
a
fool
for
luck
as
the
old
proverb
says
he
wrote
very
nicely
about
jims
and
said
he
like
to
see
him
said
rilla
so
i
wrote
and
told
him
all
about
the
wee
man
and
sent
him
snapshots
jims
will
be
two
years
old
next
week
and
he
is
a
perfect
duck
you
did
used
to
be
very
fond
of
babies
said
cousin
sophia
i
not
a
bit
fonder
of
babies
in
the
abstract
than
ever
i
was
said
rilla
frankly
but
i
do
love
jims
and
i
afraid
i
was
really
half
as
glad
as
i
should
have
been
when
jim
anderson
letter
proved
that
he
was
safe
and
sound
you
was
hoping
the
man
would
be
killed
cried
cousin
sophia
in
horrified
accents
no
no
no
i
just
hoped
he
would
go
on
forgetting
about
jims
mrs
crawford
and
then
your
pa
would
have
the
expense
of
raising
him
said
cousin
sophia
reprovingly
you
young
creeturs
are
terrible
thoughtless
jims
himself
ran
in
at
this
juncture
so
rosy
and
curly
and
kissable
that
he
extorted
a
qualified
compliment
even
from
cousin
sophia
he
a
reel
child
now
though
mebbee
his
colour
is
a
mite
too
high
sorter
consumptive
looking
as
you
might
say
i
never
thought
you
raise
him
when
i
saw
him
the
day
after
you
brung
him
home
i
reely
did
not
think
it
was
in
you
and
i
told
albert
wife
so
when
i
got
home
albert
wife
says
says
she
more
in
rilla
blythe
than
you
think
for
aunt
sophia
them
was
her
very
words
in
rilla
blythe
than
you
think
for
albert
wife
always
had
a
good
opinion
of
you
cousin
sophia
sighed
as
if
to
imply
that
albert
wife
stood
alone
in
this
against
the
world
but
cousin
sophia
really
did
not
mean
that
she
was
quite
fond
of
rilla
in
her
own
melancholy
way
but
young
creeturs
had
to
be
kept
down
if
they
were
not
kept
down
society
would
be
demoralized
do
you
remember
your
walk
home
from
the
light
two
years
ago
tonight
whispered
gertrude
oliver
to
rilla
teasingly
i
should
think
i
do
smiled
rilla
and
then
her
smile
grew
dreamy
and
absent
she
was
remembering
something
else
that
hour
with
kenneth
on
the
sandshore
where
would
ken
be
tonight
and
jem
and
jerry
and
walter
and
all
the
other
boys
who
had
danced
and
moonlighted
on
the
old
four
winds
point
that
evening
of
mirth
and
laughter
their
last
joyous
unclouded
evening
in
the
filthy
trenches
of
the
somme
front
with
the
roar
of
the
guns
and
the
groans
of
stricken
men
for
the
music
of
ned
burr
violin
and
the
flash
of
star
shells
for
the
silver
sparkles
on
the
old
blue
gulf
two
of
them
were
sleeping
under
the
flanders
poppies
alec
burr
from
the
upper
glen
and
clark
manley
of
lowbridge
others
were
wounded
in
the
hospitals
but
so
far
nothing
had
touched
the
manse
and
the
ingleside
boys
they
seemed
to
bear
charmed
lives
yet
the
suspense
never
grew
any
easier
to
bear
as
the
weeks
and
months
of
war
went
by
it
is
as
if
it
were
some
sort
of
fever
to
which
you
might
conclude
they
were
immune
when
they
had
taken
it
for
two
years
sighed
rilla
the
danger
is
just
as
great
and
just
as
real
as
it
was
the
first
day
they
went
into
the
trenches
i
know
this
and
it
tortures
me
every
day
and
yet
i
ca
help
hoping
that
since
they
come
this
far
unhurt
they
come
through
oh
miss
oliver
what
would
it
be
like
not
to
wake
up
in
the
morning
feeling
afraid
of
the
news
the
day
would
bring
i
ca
picture
such
a
state
of
things
somehow
and
two
years
ago
this
morning
i
woke
wondering
what
delightful
gift
the
new
day
would
give
me
these
are
the
two
years
i
thought
would
be
filled
with
fun
would
you
exchange
them
now
for
two
years
filled
with
fun
no
said
rilla
slowly
i
would
it
strange
is
it
they
have
been
two
terrible
years
and
yet
i
have
a
queer
feeling
of
thankfulness
for
them
as
if
they
had
brought
me
something
very
precious
with
all
their
pain
i
would
want
to
go
back
and
be
the
girl
i
was
two
years
ago
not
even
if
i
could
not
that
i
think
made
any
wonderful
progress
but
i
not
quite
the
selfish
frivolous
little
doll
i
was
then
i
suppose
i
had
a
soul
then
miss
oliver
but
i
did
know
it
i
know
it
now
and
that
is
worth
a
great
deal
worth
all
the
suffering
of
the
past
two
years
and
still
rilla
gave
a
little
apologetic
laugh
i
do
want
to
suffer
any
more
not
even
for
the
sake
of
more
soul
growth
at
the
end
of
two
more
years
i
might
look
back
and
be
thankful
for
the
development
they
had
brought
me
too
but
i
do
want
it
now
we
never
do
said
miss
oliver
that
is
why
we
are
not
left
to
choose
our
own
means
and
measure
of
development
i
suppose
no
matter
how
much
we
value
what
our
lessons
have
brought
us
we
do
want
to
go
on
with
the
bitter
schooling
well
let
us
hope
for
the
best
as
susan
says
things
are
really
going
well
now
and
if
rumania
lines
up
the
end
may
come
with
a
suddenness
that
will
surprise
us
all
rumania
did
come
in
and
susan
remarked
approvingly
that
its
king
and
queen
were
the
finest
looking
royal
couple
she
had
seen
pictures
of
so
the
summer
passed
away
early
in
september
word
came
that
the
canadians
had
been
shifted
to
the
somme
front
and
anxiety
grew
tenser
and
deeper
for
the
first
time
blythe
spirit
failed
her
a
little
and
as
the
days
of
suspense
wore
on
the
doctor
began
to
look
gravely
at
her
and
veto
this
or
that
special
effort
in
red
cross
work
oh
let
me
work
let
me
work
gilbert
she
entreated
feverishly
while
i
working
i
do
think
so
much
if
i
idle
i
imagine
everything
rest
is
only
torture
for
me
my
two
boys
are
on
the
frightful
somme
front
and
shirley
pores
day
and
night
over
aviation
literature
and
says
nothing
but
i
see
the
purpose
growing
in
his
eyes
no
i
can
not
rest
do
ask
it
of
me
gilbert
but
the
doctor
was
inexorable
i
ca
let
you
kill
yourself
he
said
when
the
boys
come
back
i
want
a
mother
here
to
welcome
them
why
you
getting
transparent
it
wo
do
ask
susan
there
if
it
will
do
oh
if
susan
and
you
are
both
banded
together
against
me
said
anne
helplessly
one
day
the
glorious
news
came
that
the
canadians
had
taken
courcelette
and
martenpuich
with
many
prisoners
and
guns
susan
ran
up
the
flag
and
said
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
haig
knew
what
soldiers
to
pick
for
a
hard
job
the
others
dared
not
feel
exultant
who
knew
what
price
had
been
paid
rilla
woke
that
morning
when
the
dawn
was
beginning
to
break
and
went
to
her
window
to
look
out
her
thick
creamy
eyelids
heavy
with
sleep
just
at
dawn
the
world
looks
as
it
never
looks
at
any
other
time
the
air
was
cold
with
dew
and
the
orchard
and
grove
and
rainbow
valley
were
full
of
mystery
and
wonder
over
the
eastern
hill
were
golden
deeps
and
shallows
there
was
no
wind
and
rilla
heard
distinctly
a
dog
howling
in
a
melancholy
way
down
in
the
direction
of
the
station
was
it
dog
monday
and
if
it
were
why
was
he
howling
like
that
rilla
shivered
the
sound
had
something
boding
and
grievous
in
it
she
remembered
that
miss
oliver
said
once
when
they
were
coming
home
in
the
darkness
and
heard
a
dog
howl
when
a
dog
cries
like
that
the
angel
of
death
is
passing
rilla
listened
with
a
curdling
fear
at
her
heart
it
was
dog
monday
she
felt
sure
of
it
whose
dirge
was
he
howling
to
whose
spirit
was
he
sending
that
anguished
greeting
and
farewell
rilla
went
back
to
bed
but
she
could
not
sleep
all
day
she
watched
and
waited
in
a
dread
of
which
she
did
not
speak
to
anyone
she
went
down
to
see
dog
monday
and
the
said
that
dog
of
yours
howled
from
midnight
to
sunrise
something
weird
i
dunno
what
got
into
him
i
got
up
once
and
went
out
and
hollered
at
him
but
he
paid
no
to
me
he
was
sitting
all
alone
in
the
moonlight
out
there
at
the
end
of
the
platform
and
every
few
minutes
the
poor
lonely
little
beggar
lift
his
nose
and
howl
as
if
his
heart
was
breaking
he
never
did
it
afore
always
slept
in
his
kennel
real
quiet
and
canny
from
train
to
train
but
he
sure
had
something
on
his
mind
last
night
dog
monday
was
lying
in
his
kennel
he
wagged
his
tail
and
licked
rilla
hand
but
he
would
not
touch
the
food
she
brought
for
him
i
afraid
he
sick
she
said
anxiously
she
hated
to
go
away
and
leave
him
but
no
bad
news
came
that
day
nor
the
next
nor
the
next
rilla
fear
lifted
dog
monday
howled
no
more
and
resumed
his
routine
of
train
meeting
and
watching
when
five
days
had
passed
the
ingleside
people
began
to
feel
that
they
might
be
cheerful
again
rilla
dashed
about
the
kitchen
helping
susan
with
the
breakfast
and
singing
so
sweetly
and
clearly
that
cousin
sophia
across
the
road
heard
her
and
croaked
out
to
albert
before
eating
cry
before
sleeping
i
always
heard
but
rilla
blythe
shed
no
tears
before
the
nightfall
when
her
father
his
face
grey
and
drawn
and
old
came
to
her
that
afternoon
and
told
her
that
walter
had
been
killed
in
action
at
courcelette
she
crumpled
up
in
a
pitiful
little
heap
of
merciful
unconsciousness
in
his
arms
nor
did
she
waken
to
her
pain
for
many
hours
chapter
xxiii
and
so
goodnight
the
fierce
flame
of
agony
had
burned
itself
out
and
the
grey
dust
of
its
ashes
was
over
all
the
world
rilla
younger
life
recovered
physically
sooner
than
her
mother
for
weeks
blythe
lay
ill
from
grief
and
shock
rilla
found
it
was
possible
to
go
on
with
existence
since
existence
had
still
to
be
reckoned
with
there
was
work
to
be
done
for
susan
could
not
do
all
for
her
mother
sake
she
had
to
put
on
calmness
and
endurance
as
a
garment
in
the
day
but
night
after
night
she
lay
in
her
bed
weeping
the
bitter
rebellious
tears
of
youth
until
at
last
tears
were
all
wept
out
and
the
little
patient
ache
that
was
to
be
in
her
heart
until
she
died
took
their
place
she
clung
to
miss
oliver
who
knew
what
to
say
and
what
not
to
say
so
few
people
did
kind
callers
and
comforters
gave
rilla
some
terrible
moments
you
get
over
it
in
time
william
reese
said
cheerfully
reese
had
three
stalwart
sons
not
one
of
whom
had
gone
to
the
front
it
such
a
blessing
it
was
walter
who
was
taken
and
not
jem
said
miss
sarah
clow
walter
was
a
member
of
the
church
and
jem
was
i
told
meredith
many
a
time
that
he
should
have
spoken
seriously
to
jem
about
it
before
he
went
away
pore
pore
walter
sighed
reese
do
not
you
come
here
calling
him
poor
walter
said
susan
indignantly
appearing
in
the
kitchen
door
much
to
the
relief
of
rilla
who
felt
that
she
could
endure
no
more
just
then
he
was
not
poor
he
was
richer
than
any
of
you
it
is
you
who
stay
at
home
and
will
not
let
your
sons
go
who
are
poor
poor
and
naked
and
mean
and
small
pisen
poor
and
so
are
your
sons
with
all
their
prosperous
farms
and
fat
cattle
and
their
souls
no
bigger
than
a
flea
if
as
big
i
came
here
to
comfort
the
afflicted
and
not
to
be
insulted
said
reese
taking
her
departure
unregretted
by
anyone
then
the
fire
went
out
of
susan
and
she
retreated
to
her
kitchen
laid
her
faithful
old
head
on
the
table
and
wept
bitterly
for
a
time
then
she
went
to
work
and
ironed
jims
little
rompers
rilla
scolded
her
gently
for
it
when
she
herself
came
in
to
do
it
i
am
not
going
to
have
you
kill
yourself
working
for
any
susan
said
obstinately
oh
i
wish
i
could
just
keep
on
working
all
the
time
susan
cried
poor
rilla
and
i
wish
i
did
have
to
go
to
sleep
it
is
hideous
to
go
to
sleep
and
forget
it
for
a
little
while
and
wake
up
and
have
it
all
rush
over
me
anew
the
next
morning
do
people
ever
get
used
to
things
like
this
susan
and
oh
susan
i
ca
get
away
from
what
reese
said
did
walter
suffer
much
he
was
always
so
sensitive
to
pain
oh
susan
if
i
knew
that
he
did
i
think
i
could
gather
up
a
little
courage
and
strength
this
merciful
knowledge
was
given
to
rilla
a
letter
came
from
commanding
officer
telling
them
that
he
had
been
killed
instantly
by
a
bullet
during
a
charge
at
courcelette
the
same
day
there
was
a
letter
for
rilla
from
walter
himself
rilla
carried
it
unopened
to
rainbow
valley
and
read
it
there
in
the
spot
where
she
had
had
her
last
talk
with
him
it
is
a
strange
thing
to
read
a
letter
after
the
writer
is
dead
a
thing
in
which
pain
and
comfort
are
strangely
mingled
for
the
first
time
since
the
blow
had
fallen
rilla
felt
a
different
thing
from
tremulous
hope
and
faith
that
walter
of
the
glorious
gift
and
the
splendid
ideals
still
lived
with
just
the
same
gift
and
just
the
same
ideals
that
could
not
be
destroyed
these
could
suffer
no
eclipse
the
personality
that
had
expressed
itself
in
that
last
letter
written
on
the
eve
of
courcelette
could
not
be
snuffed
out
by
a
german
bullet
it
must
carry
on
though
the
earthly
link
with
things
of
earth
were
broken
we
going
over
the
top
tomorrow
wrote
walter
i
wrote
mother
and
di
yesterday
but
somehow
i
feel
as
if
i
must
write
you
tonight
i
had
intended
to
do
any
writing
tonight
but
i
got
to
do
you
remember
old
tom
crawford
who
was
always
saying
that
it
was
on
her
to
do
such
and
such
a
thing
well
that
is
just
how
i
feel
it
on
me
to
write
you
tonight
you
sister
and
chum
of
mine
there
are
some
things
i
want
to
say
before
well
before
tomorrow
you
and
ingleside
seem
strangely
near
me
tonight
it
the
first
time
i
felt
this
since
i
came
always
home
has
seemed
so
far
away
so
hopelessly
far
away
from
this
hideous
welter
of
filth
and
blood
but
tonight
it
is
quite
close
to
me
it
seems
to
me
i
can
almost
see
you
hear
you
speak
and
i
can
see
the
moonlight
shining
white
and
still
on
the
old
hills
of
home
it
has
seemed
to
me
ever
since
i
came
here
that
it
was
impossible
that
there
could
be
calm
gentle
nights
and
unshattered
moonlight
anywhere
in
the
world
but
tonight
somehow
all
the
beautiful
things
i
have
always
loved
seem
to
have
become
possible
again
and
this
is
good
and
makes
me
feel
a
deep
certain
exquisite
happiness
it
must
be
autumn
at
home
now
the
harbour
is
and
the
old
glen
hills
blue
with
haze
and
rainbow
valley
a
haunt
of
delight
with
wild
asters
blowing
all
over
it
our
old
i
always
liked
that
name
better
than
it
was
a
poem
in
itself
rilla
you
know
i
always
had
premonitions
you
remember
the
pied
piper
but
no
of
course
you
would
you
were
too
young
one
evening
long
ago
when
nan
and
di
and
jem
and
the
merediths
and
i
were
together
in
rainbow
valley
i
had
a
queer
vision
or
presentiment
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
rilla
i
saw
the
piper
coming
down
the
valley
with
a
shadowy
host
behind
him
the
others
thought
i
was
only
pretending
but
i
saw
him
for
just
one
moment
and
rilla
last
night
i
saw
him
again
i
was
doing
and
i
saw
him
marching
across
from
our
trenches
to
the
german
trenches
the
same
tall
shadowy
form
piping
weirdly
and
behind
him
followed
boys
in
khaki
rilla
i
tell
you
i
saw
him
it
was
no
fancy
no
illusion
i
heard
his
music
and
then
he
was
gone
but
i
had
seen
him
and
i
knew
what
it
meant
i
knew
that
i
was
among
those
who
followed
him
rilla
the
piper
will
pipe
me
tomorrow
i
feel
sure
of
this
and
rilla
i
not
afraid
when
you
hear
the
news
remember
that
won
my
own
freedom
here
freedom
from
all
fear
i
shall
never
be
afraid
of
anything
again
not
of
death
nor
of
life
if
after
all
i
am
to
go
on
living
and
life
i
think
would
be
the
harder
of
the
two
to
face
for
it
could
never
be
beautiful
for
me
again
there
would
always
be
such
horrible
things
to
remember
things
that
would
make
life
ugly
and
painful
always
for
me
i
could
never
forget
them
but
whether
life
or
death
i
not
afraid
and
i
am
not
sorry
that
i
came
i
satisfied
i
never
write
the
poems
i
once
dreamed
of
writing
but
i
helped
to
make
canada
safe
for
the
poets
of
the
future
for
the
workers
of
the
future
ay
and
the
dreamers
too
for
if
no
man
dreams
there
will
be
nothing
for
the
workers
to
fulfil
the
future
not
of
canada
only
but
of
the
world
when
the
rain
of
langemarck
and
verdun
shall
have
brought
forth
a
golden
harvest
not
in
a
year
or
two
as
some
foolishly
think
but
a
generation
later
when
the
seed
sown
now
shall
have
had
time
to
germinate
and
grow
yes
glad
i
came
rilla
it
is
only
the
fate
of
the
little
island
i
love
that
is
in
the
balance
nor
of
canada
nor
of
england
it
the
fate
of
mankind
that
is
what
we
fighting
for
and
we
shall
win
never
for
a
moment
doubt
that
rilla
for
it
is
only
the
living
who
are
fighting
the
dead
are
fighting
too
such
an
army
can
not
be
defeated
is
there
laughter
in
your
face
yet
rilla
i
hope
so
the
world
will
need
laughter
and
courage
more
than
ever
in
the
years
that
will
come
next
i
do
want
to
preach
this
is
any
time
for
it
but
i
just
want
to
say
something
that
may
help
you
over
the
worst
when
you
hear
that
i
gone
i
a
premonition
about
you
rilla
as
well
as
about
myself
i
think
ken
will
go
back
to
you
and
that
there
are
long
years
of
happiness
for
you
and
you
will
tell
your
children
of
the
idea
we
fought
and
died
for
teach
them
it
must
be
lived
for
as
well
as
died
for
else
the
price
paid
for
it
will
have
been
given
for
nought
this
will
be
part
of
your
work
rilla
and
if
you
all
you
girls
back
in
the
homeland
do
it
then
we
who
do
come
back
will
know
that
you
have
not
faith
with
us
i
meant
to
write
to
una
tonight
too
but
i
wo
have
time
now
read
this
letter
to
her
and
tell
her
it
really
meant
for
you
both
you
two
dear
fine
loyal
girls
tomorrow
when
we
go
over
the
top
i
think
of
you
both
of
your
laughter
and
the
steadfastness
in
una
blue
eyes
somehow
i
see
those
eyes
very
plainly
tonight
too
yes
you
both
keep
faith
i
sure
of
that
you
and
una
and
so
goodnight
we
go
over
the
top
at
dawn
rilla
read
her
letter
over
many
times
there
was
a
new
light
on
her
pale
young
face
when
she
finally
stood
up
amid
the
asters
walter
had
loved
with
the
sunshine
of
autumn
around
her
for
the
moment
at
least
she
was
lifted
above
pain
and
loneliness
i
will
keep
faith
walter
she
said
steadily
i
will
work
and
teach
and
learn
and
laugh
yes
i
will
even
laugh
through
all
my
years
because
of
you
and
because
of
what
you
gave
when
you
followed
the
call
rilla
meant
to
keep
walter
letter
as
a
a
sacred
treasure
but
seeing
the
look
on
una
meredith
face
when
una
had
read
it
and
held
it
back
to
her
she
thought
of
something
could
she
do
it
oh
no
she
could
not
give
up
walter
letter
his
last
letter
surely
it
was
not
selfishness
to
keep
it
a
copy
would
be
such
a
soulless
thing
but
una
una
had
so
little
and
her
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
woman
stricken
to
the
heart
who
yet
must
not
cry
out
or
ask
for
sympathy
una
would
you
like
to
have
this
letter
to
keep
she
asked
slowly
yes
if
you
can
give
it
to
me
una
said
dully
then
you
may
have
it
said
rilla
hurriedly
thank
you
said
una
it
was
all
she
said
but
there
was
something
in
her
voice
which
repaid
rilla
for
her
bit
of
sacrifice
una
took
the
letter
and
when
rilla
had
gone
she
pressed
it
against
her
lonely
lips
una
knew
that
love
would
never
come
into
her
life
now
it
was
buried
for
ever
under
the
soil
somewhere
in
france
no
one
but
herself
and
perhaps
rilla
knew
it
would
ever
know
it
she
had
no
right
in
the
eyes
of
her
world
to
grieve
she
must
hide
and
bear
her
long
pain
as
best
she
could
alone
but
she
too
would
keep
faith
chapter
xxiv
mary
is
just
in
time
the
autumn
of
was
a
bitter
season
for
ingleside
return
to
health
was
slow
and
sorrow
and
loneliness
were
in
all
hearts
every
one
tried
to
hide
it
from
the
others
and
carry
on
cheerfully
rilla
laughed
a
good
deal
nobody
at
ingleside
was
deceived
by
her
laughter
it
came
from
her
lips
only
never
from
her
heart
but
outsiders
said
some
people
got
over
trouble
very
easily
and
irene
howard
remarked
that
she
was
surprised
to
find
how
shallow
rilla
blythe
really
was
why
after
all
her
pose
of
being
so
devoted
to
walter
she
does
seem
to
mind
his
death
at
all
nobody
has
ever
seen
her
shed
a
tear
or
heard
her
mention
his
name
she
has
evidently
quite
forgotten
him
poor
fellow
you
really
think
his
family
would
feel
it
more
i
spoke
of
him
to
rilla
at
the
last
junior
red
meeting
of
how
fine
and
brave
and
splendid
he
was
and
i
said
life
could
never
be
just
the
same
to
me
again
now
that
walter
had
gone
we
were
such
friends
you
know
why
i
was
the
very
first
person
he
told
about
having
enlisted
and
rilla
answered
as
coolly
and
indifferently
as
if
she
were
speaking
of
an
entire
stranger
was
just
one
of
many
fine
and
splendid
boys
who
have
given
everything
for
their
country
well
i
wish
i
could
take
things
as
calmly
but
i
not
made
like
that
i
so
sensitive
things
hurt
me
terribly
i
really
never
get
over
them
i
asked
rilla
right
out
why
she
did
put
on
mourning
for
walter
she
said
her
mother
did
wish
it
but
every
one
is
talking
about
it
rilla
does
wear
colours
nothing
but
white
protested
betty
mead
white
becomes
her
better
than
anything
else
said
irene
significantly
and
we
all
know
black
does
suit
her
complexion
at
all
but
of
course
i
not
saying
that
is
the
reason
she
does
wear
it
only
it
funny
if
my
brother
had
died
i
have
gone
into
deep
mourning
i
would
have
had
the
heart
for
anything
else
i
confess
i
disappointed
in
rilla
blythe
i
am
not
then
cried
betty
meade
loyally
i
think
rilla
is
just
a
wonderful
girl
a
few
years
ago
i
admit
i
did
think
she
was
rather
too
vain
and
gigglesome
but
now
she
is
nothing
of
the
sort
i
do
think
there
is
a
girl
in
the
glen
who
is
so
unselfish
and
plucky
as
rilla
or
who
has
done
her
bit
as
thoroughly
and
patiently
our
junior
red
cross
would
have
gone
on
the
rocks
a
dozen
times
if
it
had
been
for
her
tact
and
perseverance
and
enthusiasm
you
know
that
perfectly
well
irene
why
i
am
not
running
rilla
down
said
irene
opening
her
eyes
widely
it
was
only
her
lack
of
feeling
i
was
criticizing
i
suppose
she
ca
help
it
of
course
she
a
born
manager
everyone
knows
that
she
very
fond
of
managing
too
and
people
like
that
are
very
necessary
i
admit
so
do
look
at
me
as
if
i
said
something
perfectly
dreadful
betty
please
i
quite
willing
to
agree
that
rilla
blythe
is
the
embodiment
of
all
the
virtues
if
that
will
please
you
and
no
doubt
it
is
a
virtue
to
be
quite
unmoved
by
things
that
would
crush
most
people
some
of
irene
remarks
were
reported
to
rilla
but
they
did
not
hurt
her
as
they
would
once
have
done
they
did
matter
that
was
all
life
was
too
big
to
leave
room
for
pettiness
she
had
a
pact
to
keep
and
a
work
to
do
and
through
the
long
hard
days
and
weeks
of
that
disastrous
autumn
she
was
faithful
to
her
task
the
war
news
was
consistently
bad
for
germany
marched
from
victory
to
victory
over
poor
rumania
foreigners
foreigners
susan
muttered
dubiously
russians
or
rumanians
or
whatever
they
may
be
they
are
foreigners
and
you
can
not
tie
to
them
but
after
verdun
i
shall
not
give
up
hope
and
can
you
tell
me
dear
if
the
dobruja
is
a
river
or
a
mountain
range
or
a
condition
of
the
atmosphere
the
presidential
election
in
the
united
states
came
off
in
november
and
susan
was
over
that
and
quite
apologetic
for
her
excitement
i
never
thought
i
would
live
to
see
the
day
when
i
would
be
interested
in
a
yankee
election
dear
it
only
goes
to
show
we
can
never
know
what
we
will
come
to
in
this
world
and
therefore
we
should
not
be
proud
susan
stayed
up
late
on
the
evening
of
the
eleventh
ostensibly
to
finish
a
pair
of
socks
but
she
down
to
carter
flagg
store
at
intervals
and
when
the
first
report
came
through
that
hughes
had
been
elected
she
stalked
solemnly
upstairs
to
blythe
room
and
announced
it
in
a
thrilling
whisper
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
thought
if
you
were
not
asleep
you
would
be
interested
in
knowing
it
i
believe
it
is
for
the
best
perhaps
he
will
just
fall
to
writing
notes
too
dear
but
i
hope
for
better
things
i
never
was
very
partial
to
whiskers
but
one
can
not
have
everything
when
news
came
in
the
morning
that
after
all
wilson
was
susan
tacked
to
catch
another
breeze
of
optimism
well
better
a
fool
you
know
than
a
fool
you
do
not
know
as
the
old
proverb
has
it
she
remarked
cheerfully
not
that
i
hold
woodrow
to
be
a
fool
by
any
means
though
by
times
you
would
not
think
he
has
the
sense
he
was
born
with
but
he
is
a
good
letter
writer
at
least
and
we
do
not
know
if
the
hughes
man
is
even
that
all
things
being
considered
i
commend
the
yankees
they
have
shown
good
sense
and
i
do
not
mind
admitting
it
cousin
sophia
wanted
them
to
elect
roosevelt
and
is
much
disgruntled
because
they
would
not
give
him
a
chance
i
had
a
hankering
for
him
myself
but
we
must
believe
that
providence
these
matters
and
be
satisfied
though
what
the
almighty
means
in
this
affair
of
rumania
i
can
not
fathom
saying
it
with
all
reverence
susan
fathomed
it
or
thought
she
did
when
the
asquith
ministry
went
down
and
lloyd
george
became
premier
dear
lloyd
george
is
at
the
helm
at
last
i
have
been
praying
for
this
for
many
a
day
now
we
shall
soon
see
a
blessed
change
it
took
the
rumanian
disaster
to
bring
it
about
no
less
and
that
is
the
meaning
of
it
though
i
could
not
see
it
before
there
will
be
no
more
i
consider
that
the
war
is
as
good
as
won
and
that
i
shall
tie
to
whether
bucharest
falls
or
not
bucharest
did
fall
and
germany
proposed
peace
negotiations
whereat
susan
scornfully
turned
a
deaf
ear
and
absolutely
refused
to
listen
to
such
proposals
when
president
wilson
sent
his
famous
december
peace
note
susan
waxed
violently
sarcastic
woodrow
wilson
is
going
to
make
peace
i
understand
first
henry
ford
had
a
try
at
it
and
now
comes
wilson
but
peace
is
not
made
with
ink
woodrow
and
that
you
may
tie
to
said
susan
apostrophizing
the
unlucky
president
out
of
the
kitchen
window
nearest
the
united
states
lloyd
george
speech
will
tell
the
kaiser
what
is
what
and
you
may
keep
your
peace
screeds
at
home
and
save
postage
what
a
pity
president
wilson
ca
hear
you
susan
said
rilla
slyly
indeed
rilla
dear
it
is
a
pity
that
he
has
no
one
near
him
to
give
him
good
advice
as
it
is
clear
he
has
not
in
all
those
democrats
and
republicans
retorted
susan
i
do
not
know
the
difference
between
them
for
the
politics
of
the
yankees
is
a
puzzle
i
can
not
solve
study
it
as
i
may
but
as
far
as
seeing
through
a
grindstone
goes
i
am
afraid
susan
shook
her
head
dubiously
that
they
are
all
tarred
with
the
same
brush
i
am
thankful
christmas
is
over
rilla
wrote
in
her
diary
during
the
last
week
of
a
stormy
december
we
had
dreaded
it
so
the
first
christmas
since
courcelette
but
we
had
all
the
merediths
down
for
dinner
and
nobody
tried
to
be
gay
or
cheerful
we
were
all
just
quiet
and
friendly
and
that
helped
then
too
i
was
so
thankful
that
jims
had
got
better
so
thankful
that
i
almost
felt
glad
almost
but
not
quite
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
feel
really
glad
over
anything
again
it
seems
as
if
gladness
were
killed
in
me
shot
down
by
the
same
bullet
that
pierced
walter
heart
perhaps
some
day
a
new
kind
of
gladness
will
be
born
in
my
soul
but
the
old
kind
will
never
live
again
winter
set
in
awfully
early
this
year
ten
days
before
christmas
we
had
a
big
snowstorm
at
least
we
thought
it
big
at
the
time
as
it
happened
it
was
only
a
prelude
to
the
real
performance
it
was
fine
the
next
day
and
ingleside
and
rainbow
valley
were
wonderful
with
the
trees
all
covered
with
snow
and
big
drifts
everywhere
carved
into
the
most
fantastic
shapes
by
the
chisel
of
the
northeast
wind
father
and
mother
went
up
to
avonlea
father
thought
the
change
would
do
mother
good
and
they
wanted
to
see
poor
aunt
diana
whose
son
jock
had
been
seriously
wounded
a
short
time
before
they
left
susan
and
me
to
keep
house
and
father
expected
to
be
back
the
next
day
but
he
never
got
back
for
a
week
that
night
it
began
to
storm
again
and
it
stormed
unbrokenly
for
four
days
it
was
the
worst
and
longest
storm
that
prince
edward
island
has
known
for
years
everything
was
disorganized
the
roads
were
completely
choked
up
the
trains
blockaded
and
the
telephone
wires
put
entirely
out
of
commission
and
then
jims
took
he
had
a
little
cold
when
father
and
mother
went
away
and
he
kept
getting
worse
for
a
couple
of
days
but
it
did
occur
to
me
that
there
was
danger
of
anything
serious
i
never
even
took
his
temperature
and
i
ca
forgive
myself
because
it
was
sheer
carelessness
the
truth
is
i
had
slumped
just
then
mother
was
away
so
i
let
myself
go
all
at
once
i
was
tired
of
keeping
up
and
pretending
to
be
brave
and
cheerful
and
i
just
gave
up
for
a
few
days
and
spent
most
of
the
time
lying
on
my
face
on
my
bed
crying
i
neglected
jims
that
is
the
hateful
truth
i
was
cowardly
and
false
to
what
i
promised
walter
and
if
jims
had
died
i
could
never
have
forgiven
myself
then
the
third
night
after
father
and
mother
went
away
jims
suddenly
got
worse
oh
so
much
worse
all
at
once
susan
and
i
were
all
alone
gertrude
had
been
at
lowbridge
when
the
storm
began
and
had
never
got
back
at
first
we
were
not
much
alarmed
jims
has
had
several
bouts
of
croup
and
susan
and
morgan
and
i
have
always
brought
him
through
without
much
trouble
but
it
was
very
long
before
we
were
dreadfully
alarmed
never
saw
croup
like
this
before
said
susan
as
for
me
i
knew
when
it
was
too
late
what
kind
of
croup
it
was
i
knew
it
was
not
the
ordinary
croup
croup
as
doctors
call
it
but
the
croup
and
i
knew
that
it
was
a
deadly
and
dangerous
thing
and
father
was
away
and
there
was
no
doctor
nearer
than
lowbridge
and
we
could
not
and
neither
horse
nor
man
could
get
through
the
drifts
that
night
gallant
little
jims
put
up
a
good
fight
for
his
life
susan
and
i
tried
every
remedy
we
could
think
of
or
find
in
father
books
but
he
continued
to
grow
worse
it
was
to
see
and
hear
him
he
gasped
so
horribly
for
breath
the
poor
little
soul
and
his
face
turned
a
dreadful
bluish
colour
and
had
such
an
agonized
expression
and
he
kept
struggling
with
his
little
hands
as
if
he
were
appealing
to
us
to
help
him
somehow
i
found
myself
thinking
that
the
boys
who
had
been
gassed
at
the
front
must
have
looked
like
that
and
the
thought
haunted
me
amid
all
my
dread
and
misery
over
jims
and
all
the
time
the
fatal
membrane
in
his
wee
throat
grew
and
thickened
and
he
could
get
it
up
oh
i
was
just
wild
i
never
realized
how
dear
jims
was
to
me
until
that
moment
and
i
felt
so
utterly
helpless
and
then
susan
gave
up
can
not
save
him
oh
if
your
father
was
here
look
at
him
the
poor
little
fellow
i
know
not
what
to
do
i
looked
at
jims
and
i
thought
he
was
dying
susan
was
holding
him
up
in
his
crib
to
give
him
a
better
chance
for
breath
but
it
did
seem
as
if
he
could
breathe
at
all
my
little
with
his
dear
ways
and
sweet
roguish
face
was
choking
to
death
before
my
very
eyes
and
i
could
help
him
i
threw
down
the
hot
poultice
i
had
ready
in
despair
of
what
use
was
it
jims
was
dying
and
it
was
my
fault
i
had
been
careful
enough
just
then
at
eleven
at
night
the
door
bell
rang
such
a
ring
it
pealed
all
over
the
house
above
the
roar
of
the
storm
susan
could
go
she
dared
not
lay
jims
down
so
i
rushed
downstairs
in
the
hall
i
paused
just
a
minute
i
was
suddenly
overcome
by
an
absurd
dread
i
thought
of
a
weird
story
gertrude
had
told
me
once
an
aunt
of
hers
was
alone
in
a
house
one
night
with
her
sick
husband
she
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
and
when
she
went
and
opened
it
there
was
nothing
there
nothing
that
could
be
seen
at
least
but
when
she
opened
the
door
a
deadly
cold
wind
blew
in
and
seemed
to
sweep
past
her
right
up
the
stairs
although
it
was
a
calm
warm
summer
night
outside
immediately
she
heard
a
cry
she
ran
upstairs
and
her
husband
was
dead
and
she
always
believed
so
gertrude
said
that
when
she
opened
that
door
she
let
death
in
it
was
so
ridiculous
of
me
to
feel
so
frightened
but
i
was
distracted
and
worn
out
and
i
simply
felt
for
a
moment
that
i
dared
not
open
the
door
that
death
was
waiting
outside
then
i
remembered
that
i
had
no
time
to
waste
must
not
be
so
foolish
i
sprang
forward
and
opened
the
door
certainly
a
cold
wind
did
blow
in
and
filled
the
hall
with
a
whirl
of
snow
but
there
on
the
threshold
stood
a
form
of
flesh
and
blood
mary
vance
coated
from
head
to
foot
with
snow
and
she
brought
life
not
death
with
her
though
i
did
know
that
then
i
just
stared
at
her
have
been
turned
out
grinned
mary
as
she
stepped
in
and
shut
the
door
came
up
to
carter
flagg
two
days
ago
and
i
been
there
ever
since
but
old
abbie
flagg
got
on
my
nerves
at
last
and
tonight
i
just
made
up
my
mind
to
come
up
here
i
thought
i
could
wade
this
far
but
i
can
tell
you
it
was
as
much
as
a
bargain
once
i
thought
i
was
stuck
for
keeps
ai
it
an
awful
night
i
came
to
myself
and
knew
i
must
hurry
upstairs
i
explained
as
quickly
as
i
could
to
mary
and
left
her
trying
to
brush
the
snow
off
upstairs
i
found
that
jims
was
over
that
paroxysm
but
almost
as
soon
as
i
got
back
to
the
room
he
was
in
the
grip
of
another
i
could
do
anything
but
moan
and
cry
oh
how
ashamed
i
am
when
i
think
of
it
and
yet
what
could
i
do
we
had
tried
everything
we
knew
and
then
all
at
once
i
heard
mary
vance
saying
loudly
behind
me
that
child
is
dying
i
whirled
around
did
i
know
he
was
dying
my
little
jims
i
could
have
thrown
mary
vance
out
of
the
door
or
the
window
anywhere
at
that
moment
there
she
stood
cool
and
composed
looking
down
at
my
baby
with
those
weird
white
eyes
of
hers
as
she
might
look
at
a
choking
kitten
i
had
always
disliked
mary
vance
and
just
then
i
hated
her
have
tried
everything
said
poor
susan
dully
is
not
ordinary
croup
it
the
dipthery
croup
said
mary
briskly
snatching
up
an
apron
there
mighty
little
time
to
lose
but
i
know
what
to
do
when
i
lived
with
wiley
years
ago
will
kid
died
of
dipthery
croup
in
spite
of
two
doctors
and
when
old
aunt
christina
macallister
heard
of
it
she
was
the
one
brought
me
round
when
i
nearly
died
of
pneumonia
you
know
she
was
a
wonder
no
doctor
was
a
patch
on
her
they
do
hatch
her
breed
of
cats
nowadays
let
me
tell
you
she
said
she
could
have
saved
him
with
her
remedy
if
she
been
there
she
told
wiley
what
it
was
and
never
forgot
it
i
the
greatest
memory
ever
a
thing
just
lies
in
the
back
of
my
head
till
the
time
comes
to
use
it
got
any
sulphur
in
the
house
susan
yes
we
had
sulphur
susan
went
down
with
mary
to
get
it
and
i
held
jims
i
had
any
hope
not
the
least
mary
vance
might
brag
as
she
liked
she
was
always
bragging
but
i
did
believe
any
remedy
could
save
jims
now
presently
mary
came
back
she
had
tied
a
piece
of
thick
flannel
over
her
mouth
and
nose
and
she
carried
old
tin
chip
pan
half
full
of
burning
coals
watch
me
she
said
boastfully
never
done
this
but
kill
or
cure
that
child
is
dying
anyway
she
sprinkled
a
spoonful
of
sulphur
over
the
coals
and
then
she
picked
up
jims
turned
him
over
and
held
him
face
downward
right
over
those
choking
blinding
fumes
i
do
know
why
i
did
spring
forward
and
snatch
him
away
susan
says
it
was
because
it
was
that
i
should
and
i
think
she
is
right
because
it
did
really
seem
that
i
was
powerless
to
move
susan
herself
seemed
transfixed
watching
mary
from
the
doorway
jims
writhed
in
those
big
firm
capable
hands
of
mary
oh
yes
she
is
capable
all
right
and
choked
and
wheezed
and
choked
and
wheezed
and
i
felt
that
he
was
being
tortured
to
death
and
then
all
at
once
after
what
seemed
to
me
an
hour
though
it
really
was
long
he
coughed
up
the
membrane
that
was
killing
him
mary
turned
him
over
and
laid
him
back
on
his
bed
he
was
white
as
marble
and
the
tears
were
pouring
out
of
his
brown
eyes
but
that
awful
livid
look
was
gone
from
his
face
and
he
could
breathe
quite
easily
that
some
trick
said
mary
gaily
had
any
idea
how
it
would
work
but
i
just
took
a
chance
i
smoke
his
throat
out
again
once
or
twice
before
morning
just
to
kill
all
the
germs
but
see
he
be
all
right
now
jims
went
right
to
sleep
real
sleep
not
coma
as
i
feared
at
first
mary
him
as
she
called
it
twice
through
the
night
and
at
daylight
his
throat
was
perfectly
clear
and
his
temperature
was
almost
normal
when
i
made
sure
of
that
i
turned
and
looked
at
mary
vance
she
was
sitting
on
the
lounge
laying
down
the
law
to
susan
on
some
subject
about
which
susan
must
have
known
forty
times
as
much
as
she
did
but
i
did
mind
how
much
law
she
laid
down
or
how
much
she
bragged
she
had
a
right
to
brag
she
had
dared
to
do
what
i
would
never
have
dared
and
had
saved
jims
from
a
horrible
death
it
did
matter
any
more
that
she
had
once
chased
me
through
the
glen
with
a
codfish
it
matter
that
she
had
smeared
all
over
my
dream
of
romance
the
night
of
the
lighthouse
dance
it
did
matter
that
she
thought
she
knew
more
than
anybody
else
and
always
rubbed
it
in
i
would
never
dislike
mary
vance
again
i
went
over
to
her
and
kissed
her
up
now
she
said
only
i
so
grateful
to
you
mary
i
think
you
ought
to
be
that
a
fact
you
two
would
have
let
that
baby
die
on
your
hands
if
i
had
happened
along
said
mary
just
beaming
with
complacency
she
got
susan
and
me
a
breakfast
and
made
us
eat
it
and
the
life
out
of
us
as
susan
says
for
two
days
until
the
roads
were
opened
so
that
she
could
get
home
jims
was
almost
well
by
that
time
and
father
turned
up
he
heard
our
tale
without
saying
much
father
is
rather
scornful
generally
about
what
he
calls
wives
remedies
he
laughed
a
little
and
said
this
mary
vance
will
expect
me
to
call
her
in
for
consultation
in
all
my
serious
cases
so
christmas
was
not
so
hard
as
i
expected
it
to
be
and
now
the
new
year
is
coming
and
we
are
still
hoping
for
the
push
that
will
end
the
war
and
little
dog
monday
is
getting
stiff
and
rheumatic
from
his
cold
vigils
but
still
he
on
and
shirley
continues
to
read
the
exploits
of
the
aces
oh
what
will
you
bring
chapter
xxv
shirley
goes
no
woodrow
there
will
be
no
peace
without
victory
said
susan
sticking
her
knitting
needle
viciously
through
president
wilson
name
in
the
newspaper
column
we
canadians
mean
to
have
peace
and
victory
too
you
if
it
pleases
you
woodrow
can
have
the
peace
without
the
victory
and
susan
stalked
off
to
bed
with
the
comfortable
consciousness
of
having
got
the
better
of
the
argument
with
the
president
but
a
few
days
later
she
rushed
to
blythe
in
excitement
dear
what
do
you
think
a
message
has
just
come
through
from
charlottetown
that
woodrow
wilson
has
sent
that
german
ambassador
man
to
the
right
about
at
last
they
tell
me
that
means
war
so
i
begin
to
think
that
woodrow
heart
is
in
the
right
place
after
all
wherever
his
head
may
be
and
i
am
going
to
commandeer
a
little
sugar
and
celebrate
the
occasion
with
some
fudge
despite
the
howls
of
the
food
board
i
thought
that
submarine
business
would
bring
things
to
a
crisis
i
told
cousin
sophia
so
when
she
said
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
the
allies
do
let
the
doctor
hear
of
the
fudge
susan
said
anne
with
a
smile
you
know
he
has
laid
down
very
strict
rules
for
us
along
the
lines
of
economy
the
government
has
asked
for
yes
dear
and
a
man
should
be
master
in
his
own
household
and
his
women
folk
should
bow
to
his
decrees
i
flatter
myself
that
i
am
becoming
quite
efficient
in
economizing
susan
had
taken
to
using
certain
german
terms
with
killing
effect
but
one
can
exercise
a
little
gumption
on
the
quiet
now
and
then
shirley
was
wishing
for
some
of
my
fudge
the
other
day
the
susan
brand
as
he
called
it
and
i
said
first
victory
there
is
to
celebrate
i
shall
make
you
some
i
consider
this
news
quite
equal
to
a
victory
and
what
the
doctor
does
not
know
will
never
grieve
him
i
take
the
whole
responsibility
dear
so
do
not
you
vex
your
conscience
susan
spoiled
shirley
shamelessly
that
winter
he
came
home
from
queen
every
and
susan
had
all
his
favourite
dishes
for
him
in
so
far
as
she
could
evade
or
wheedle
the
doctor
and
waited
on
him
hand
and
foot
though
she
talked
war
constantly
to
everyone
else
she
never
mentioned
it
to
him
or
before
him
but
she
watched
him
like
a
cat
watching
a
mouse
and
when
the
german
retreat
from
the
bapaume
salient
began
and
continued
susan
exultation
was
linked
up
with
something
deeper
than
anything
she
expressed
surely
the
end
was
in
sight
would
come
now
before
anyone
else
could
go
things
are
coming
our
way
at
last
we
have
got
the
germans
on
the
run
she
boasted
the
united
states
has
declared
war
at
last
as
i
always
believed
they
would
in
spite
of
woodrow
gift
for
letter
writing
and
you
will
see
they
will
go
into
it
with
a
vim
since
i
understand
that
is
their
habit
when
they
do
start
and
we
have
got
the
germans
on
the
run
too
the
states
mean
well
moaned
cousin
sophia
but
all
the
vim
in
the
world
can
not
put
them
on
the
fighting
line
this
spring
and
the
allies
will
be
finished
before
that
the
germans
are
just
luring
them
on
that
man
simonds
says
their
retreat
has
put
the
allies
in
a
hole
that
man
simonds
has
said
more
than
he
will
ever
live
to
make
good
retorted
susan
i
do
not
worry
myself
about
his
opinion
as
long
as
lloyd
george
is
premier
of
england
he
will
not
be
bamboozled
and
that
you
may
tie
to
things
look
good
to
me
the
is
in
the
war
and
we
have
got
kut
and
bagdad
back
and
i
would
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
allies
in
berlin
by
june
and
the
russians
too
since
they
have
got
rid
of
the
czar
that
in
my
opinion
was
a
good
piece
of
work
time
will
show
if
it
is
said
cousin
sophia
who
would
have
been
very
indignant
if
anyone
had
told
her
that
she
would
rather
see
susan
put
to
shame
as
a
seer
than
a
successful
overthrow
of
tyranny
or
even
the
march
of
the
allies
down
unter
den
linden
but
then
the
woes
of
the
russian
people
were
quite
unknown
to
cousin
sophia
while
this
aggravating
optimistic
susan
was
an
thorn
in
her
side
just
at
that
moment
shirley
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
table
in
the
swinging
his
legs
a
brown
ruddy
wholesome
lad
from
top
to
toe
every
inch
of
him
and
saying
coolly
mother
and
dad
i
was
eighteen
last
monday
do
you
think
it
about
time
i
joined
up
the
pale
mother
looked
at
him
two
of
my
sons
have
gone
and
one
will
never
return
must
i
give
you
too
shirley
the
cry
joseph
is
not
and
simeon
is
not
and
ye
will
take
benjamin
away
how
the
mothers
of
the
great
war
echoed
the
old
patriarch
moan
of
so
many
centuries
agone
you
would
have
me
a
slacker
mother
i
can
get
into
the
what
say
dad
the
doctor
hands
were
not
quite
steady
as
he
folded
up
the
powders
he
was
concocting
for
abbie
flagg
rheumatism
he
had
known
this
moment
was
coming
yet
he
was
not
altogether
prepared
for
it
he
answered
slowly
i
wo
try
to
hold
you
back
from
what
you
believe
to
be
your
duty
but
you
must
not
go
unless
your
mother
says
you
may
shirley
said
nothing
more
he
was
not
a
lad
of
many
words
anne
did
not
say
anything
more
just
then
either
she
was
thinking
of
little
grave
in
the
old
little
joyce
who
would
have
been
a
woman
now
had
she
lived
of
the
white
cross
in
france
and
the
splendid
grey
eyes
of
the
little
boy
who
had
been
taught
his
first
lessons
of
duty
and
loyalty
at
her
knee
of
jem
in
the
terrible
trenches
of
nan
and
di
and
rilla
waiting
waiting
waiting
while
the
golden
years
of
youth
passed
by
and
she
wondered
if
she
could
bear
any
more
she
thought
not
surely
she
had
given
enough
yet
that
night
she
told
shirley
that
he
might
go
they
did
not
tell
susan
right
away
she
did
not
know
it
until
a
few
days
later
shirley
presented
himself
in
her
kitchen
in
his
aviation
uniform
susan
did
make
half
the
fuss
she
had
made
when
jem
and
walter
had
gone
she
said
stonily
so
they
going
to
take
you
too
take
me
no
i
going
susan
got
to
susan
sat
down
by
the
table
folded
her
knotted
old
hands
that
had
grown
warped
and
twisted
working
for
the
ingleside
children
to
still
their
shaking
and
said
yes
you
must
go
i
did
not
see
once
why
such
things
must
be
but
i
can
see
now
you
a
brick
susan
said
shirley
he
was
relieved
that
she
took
it
so
coolly
he
had
been
a
little
afraid
with
a
boy
horror
of
a
scene
he
went
out
whistling
gaily
but
half
an
hour
later
when
pale
anne
blythe
came
in
susan
was
still
sitting
there
dear
said
susan
making
an
admission
she
would
once
have
died
rather
than
make
i
feel
very
old
jem
and
walter
were
yours
but
shirley
is
mine
and
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
him
flying
his
machine
crashing
down
the
life
crushed
out
of
his
body
the
dear
little
body
i
nursed
and
cuddled
when
he
was
a
wee
baby
susan
do
cried
anne
oh
dear
i
beg
your
pardon
i
ought
not
to
have
said
anything
like
that
out
loud
i
sometimes
forget
that
i
resolved
to
be
a
heroine
this
this
has
shaken
me
a
little
but
i
will
not
forget
myself
again
only
if
things
do
not
go
as
smoothly
in
the
kitchen
for
a
few
days
i
hope
you
will
make
due
allowance
for
me
at
least
said
poor
susan
forcing
a
grim
smile
in
a
desperate
effort
to
recover
lost
standing
at
least
flying
is
a
clean
job
he
will
not
get
so
dirty
and
messed
up
as
he
would
in
the
trenches
and
that
is
well
for
he
has
always
been
a
tidy
child
so
shirley
went
not
radiantly
as
to
a
high
adventure
like
jem
not
in
a
white
flame
of
sacrifice
like
walter
but
in
a
cool
mood
as
of
one
doing
something
rather
dirty
and
disagreeable
that
had
just
got
to
be
done
he
kissed
susan
for
the
first
time
since
he
was
five
years
old
and
said
susan
mother
susan
my
little
brown
boy
my
little
brown
boy
said
susan
i
wonder
she
thought
bitterly
as
she
looked
at
the
doctor
sorrowful
face
if
you
remember
how
you
spanked
him
once
when
he
was
a
baby
i
am
thankful
i
have
nothing
like
that
on
my
conscience
now
the
doctor
did
not
remember
the
old
discipline
but
before
he
put
on
his
hat
to
go
out
on
his
round
of
calls
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
great
silent
that
had
once
been
full
of
children
laughter
our
last
son
our
last
son
he
said
aloud
a
good
sturdy
sensible
lad
too
always
reminded
me
of
my
father
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
proud
that
he
wanted
to
go
i
was
proud
when
jem
went
even
when
walter
went
but
house
is
left
us
desolate
i
have
been
thinking
doctor
old
sandy
of
the
upper
glen
said
to
him
that
afternoon
that
your
house
will
be
seeming
very
big
the
day
highland
sandy
quaint
phrase
struck
the
doctor
as
perfectly
expressive
ingleside
did
seem
very
big
and
empty
that
night
yet
shirley
had
been
away
all
winter
except
for
and
had
always
been
a
quiet
fellow
even
when
home
was
it
because
he
had
been
the
only
one
left
that
his
going
seemed
to
leave
such
a
huge
blank
that
every
room
seemed
vacant
and
deserted
that
the
very
trees
on
the
lawn
seemed
to
be
trying
to
comfort
each
other
with
caresses
of
boughs
for
the
loss
of
the
last
of
the
little
lads
who
had
romped
under
them
in
childhood
susan
worked
very
hard
all
day
and
late
into
the
night
when
she
had
wound
the
kitchen
clock
and
put
jekyll
out
none
too
gently
she
stood
for
a
little
while
on
the
doorstep
looking
down
the
glen
which
lay
tranced
in
faint
silvery
light
from
a
sinking
young
moon
but
susan
did
not
see
the
familiar
hills
and
harbour
she
was
looking
at
the
aviation
camp
in
kingsport
where
shirley
was
that
night
he
called
me
susan
she
was
thinking
well
all
our
men
folk
have
gone
now
jem
and
walter
and
shirley
and
jerry
and
carl
and
none
of
them
had
to
be
driven
to
it
so
we
have
a
right
to
be
proud
but
pride
susan
sighed
bitterly
pride
is
cold
company
and
that
there
is
no
gainsaying
the
moon
sank
lower
into
a
black
cloud
in
the
west
the
glen
went
out
in
an
eclipse
of
sudden
shadow
and
thousands
of
miles
away
the
canadian
boys
in
khaki
the
living
and
the
dead
were
in
possession
of
vimy
ridge
vimy
ridge
is
a
name
written
in
crimson
and
gold
on
the
canadian
annals
of
the
great
war
the
british
could
take
it
and
the
french
take
it
said
a
german
prisoner
to
his
captors
but
you
canadians
are
such
fools
that
you
do
know
when
a
place
ca
be
taken
so
the
fools
took
it
and
paid
the
price
jerry
meredith
was
seriously
wounded
at
vimy
ridge
shot
in
the
back
the
telegram
said
poor
nan
said
blythe
when
the
news
came
she
thought
of
her
own
happy
girlhood
at
old
green
gables
there
had
been
no
tragedy
like
this
in
it
how
the
girls
of
had
to
suffer
when
nan
came
home
from
redmond
two
weeks
later
her
face
showed
what
those
weeks
had
meant
to
her
john
meredith
too
seemed
to
have
grown
old
suddenly
in
them
faith
did
not
come
home
she
was
on
her
way
across
the
atlantic
as
a
di
had
tried
to
wring
from
her
father
consent
to
her
going
also
but
had
been
told
that
for
her
mother
sake
it
could
not
be
given
so
di
after
a
flying
visit
home
went
back
to
her
red
cross
work
in
kingsport
the
mayflowers
bloomed
in
the
secret
nooks
of
rainbow
valley
rilla
was
watching
for
them
jem
had
once
taken
his
mother
the
earliest
mayflowers
walter
brought
them
to
her
when
jem
was
gone
last
spring
shirley
had
sought
them
out
for
her
now
rilla
thought
she
must
take
the
boys
place
in
this
but
before
she
had
discovered
any
bruce
meredith
came
to
ingleside
one
twilight
with
his
hands
full
of
delicate
pink
sprays
he
stalked
up
the
steps
of
the
veranda
and
laid
them
on
blythe
lap
because
shirley
is
here
to
bring
them
he
said
in
his
funny
shy
blunt
way
and
you
thought
of
this
you
darling
said
anne
her
lips
quivering
as
she
looked
at
the
stocky
little
chap
standing
before
her
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
i
wrote
jem
and
told
him
not
to
worry
you
not
getting
your
mayflowers
said
bruce
seriously
i
see
to
that
and
i
told
him
i
would
be
ten
pretty
soon
now
so
it
wo
be
very
long
before
i
be
eighteen
and
then
i
go
to
help
him
fight
and
maybe
let
him
come
home
for
a
rest
while
i
took
his
place
i
wrote
jerry
too
jerry
getting
better
you
know
is
he
have
you
had
any
good
news
about
him
yes
mother
had
a
letter
and
it
said
he
was
out
of
danger
oh
thank
god
murmured
blythe
in
a
bruce
looked
at
her
curiously
that
is
what
father
said
when
mother
told
him
but
when
l
said
it
the
other
day
when
i
found
out
mead
dog
had
hurt
my
kitten
i
thought
he
had
shooken
it
to
death
you
know
father
looked
awful
solemn
and
said
i
must
never
say
that
again
about
a
kitten
but
i
could
understand
why
blythe
i
felt
awful
thankful
and
it
must
have
been
god
that
saved
stripey
because
that
mead
dog
had
jaws
and
oh
how
it
shook
poor
stripey
and
so
why
could
i
thank
him
added
bruce
reminiscently
maybe
i
said
it
too
loud
i
was
awful
glad
and
excited
when
i
found
stripey
was
all
right
i
shouted
it
blythe
maybe
if
i
said
it
sort
of
whispery
like
you
and
father
it
would
have
been
all
right
do
you
know
blythe
bruce
dropped
to
a
whispery
tone
edging
a
little
nearer
to
anne
what
i
would
like
to
do
to
the
kaiser
if
i
could
what
would
you
like
to
do
laddie
norman
reese
said
in
school
that
he
would
like
to
tie
the
kaiser
to
a
tree
and
set
cross
dogs
to
worrying
him
said
bruce
gravely
and
emily
flagg
said
she
would
like
to
put
him
in
a
cage
and
poke
sharp
things
into
him
and
they
all
said
things
like
that
but
blythe
bruce
took
a
little
square
paw
out
of
his
pocket
and
put
it
earnestly
on
anne
knee
i
would
like
to
turn
the
kaiser
into
a
good
man
a
very
good
man
all
at
once
if
i
could
that
is
what
i
would
do
do
you
think
blythe
that
would
be
the
very
worstest
punishment
of
all
bless
the
child
said
susan
how
do
you
make
out
that
would
be
any
kind
of
a
punishment
for
that
wicked
fiend
do
you
see
said
bruce
looking
levelly
at
susan
out
of
his
blackly
blue
eyes
if
he
was
turned
into
a
good
man
he
would
understand
how
dreadful
the
things
he
has
done
are
and
he
would
feel
so
terrible
about
it
that
he
would
be
more
unhappy
and
miserable
than
he
could
ever
be
in
any
other
way
he
would
feel
just
awful
and
he
would
go
on
feeling
like
that
forever
yes
bruce
clenched
his
hands
and
nodded
his
head
emphatically
yes
i
would
make
the
kaiser
a
good
man
that
is
what
i
would
do
it
would
serve
him
right
chapter
xxvi
susan
has
a
proposal
of
marriage
an
aeroplane
was
flying
over
glen
mary
like
a
great
bird
poised
against
the
western
sky
a
sky
so
clear
and
of
such
a
pale
silvery
yellow
that
it
gave
an
impression
of
a
vast
space
of
freedom
the
little
group
on
the
ingleside
lawn
looked
up
at
it
with
fascinated
eyes
although
it
was
by
no
means
an
unusual
thing
to
see
an
occasional
hovering
plane
that
summer
susan
was
always
intensely
excited
who
knew
but
that
it
might
be
shirley
away
up
there
in
the
clouds
flying
over
to
the
island
from
kingsport
but
shirley
had
gone
overseas
now
so
susan
was
not
so
keenly
interested
in
this
particular
aeroplane
and
its
pilot
nevertheless
she
looked
at
it
with
awe
i
wonder
dear
she
said
solemnly
what
the
old
folks
down
there
in
the
graveyard
would
think
if
they
could
rise
out
of
their
graves
for
one
moment
and
behold
that
sight
i
am
sure
my
father
would
disapprove
of
it
for
he
was
a
man
who
did
not
believe
in
ideas
of
any
sort
he
always
cut
his
grain
with
a
reaping
hook
to
the
day
of
his
death
a
mower
he
would
not
have
what
was
good
enough
for
his
father
was
good
enough
for
him
he
used
to
say
i
hope
it
is
not
unfilial
to
say
that
i
think
he
was
wrong
in
that
point
of
view
but
i
am
not
sure
i
go
so
far
as
to
approve
of
aeroplanes
though
they
may
be
a
military
necessity
if
the
almighty
had
meant
us
to
fly
he
would
have
provided
us
with
wings
since
he
did
not
it
is
plain
he
meant
us
to
stick
to
the
solid
earth
at
any
rate
you
will
never
see
me
dear
cavorting
through
the
sky
in
an
aeroplane
but
you
wo
refuse
to
cavort
a
bit
in
father
new
automobile
when
it
comes
will
you
susan
teased
rilla
i
do
not
expect
to
trust
my
old
bones
in
automobiles
either
retorted
susan
but
i
do
not
look
upon
them
as
some
people
do
says
the
government
should
be
turned
out
of
office
for
permitting
them
to
run
on
the
island
at
all
he
foams
at
the
mouth
they
tell
me
when
he
sees
one
the
other
day
he
saw
one
coming
along
that
narrow
by
his
wheatfield
and
whiskers
bounded
over
the
fence
and
stood
right
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
his
pitchfork
the
man
in
the
machine
was
an
agent
of
some
kind
and
whiskers
hates
agents
as
much
as
he
hates
automobiles
he
made
the
car
come
to
a
halt
because
there
was
not
room
to
pass
him
on
either
side
and
the
agent
could
not
actually
run
over
him
then
he
raised
his
pitchfork
and
shouted
out
of
this
with
your
or
i
will
run
this
pitchfork
clean
through
you
and
dear
if
you
will
believe
me
that
poor
agent
had
to
back
his
car
clean
out
to
the
lowbridge
road
nearly
a
mile
whiskers
following
him
every
step
shaking
his
pitchfork
and
bellowing
insults
now
dear
i
call
such
conduct
unreasonable
but
all
the
same
added
susan
with
a
sigh
what
with
aeroplanes
and
automobiles
and
all
the
rest
of
it
this
island
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
the
aeroplane
soared
and
dipped
and
circled
and
soared
again
until
it
became
a
mere
speck
far
over
the
sunset
hills
the
majesty
of
pinion
which
the
theban
eagles
bear
sailing
with
supreme
dominion
through
the
azure
fields
of
air
quoted
anne
blythe
dreamily
i
wonder
said
miss
oliver
if
humanity
will
be
any
happier
because
of
aeroplanes
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sum
of
human
happiness
remains
much
the
same
from
age
to
age
no
matter
how
it
may
vary
in
distribution
and
that
all
the
inventions
neither
lessen
nor
increase
it
after
all
the
of
heaven
is
within
you
said
meredith
gazing
after
the
vanishing
speck
which
symbolized
man
latest
victory
in
a
struggle
it
does
not
depend
on
material
achievements
and
triumphs
nevertheless
an
aeroplane
is
a
fascinating
thing
said
the
doctor
it
has
always
been
one
of
humanity
favourite
dreams
the
dream
of
flying
dream
after
dream
comes
true
or
rather
is
made
true
by
persevering
effort
i
should
like
to
have
a
flight
in
an
aeroplane
myself
shirley
wrote
me
that
he
was
dreadfully
disappointed
in
his
first
flight
said
rilla
he
had
expected
to
experience
the
sensation
of
soaring
up
from
the
earth
like
a
bird
and
instead
he
just
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
moving
at
all
but
that
the
earth
was
dropping
away
under
him
and
the
first
time
he
went
up
alone
he
suddenly
felt
terribly
homesick
he
had
never
felt
like
that
before
but
all
at
once
he
said
he
felt
as
if
he
were
adrift
in
space
and
he
had
a
wild
desire
to
get
back
home
to
the
old
planet
and
the
companionship
of
fellow
creatures
he
soon
got
over
that
feeling
but
he
says
his
first
flight
alone
was
a
nightmare
to
him
because
of
that
dreadful
sensation
of
ghastly
loneliness
the
aeroplane
disappeared
the
doctor
threw
back
his
head
with
a
sigh
when
i
have
watched
one
of
those
out
of
sight
i
come
back
to
earth
with
an
odd
feeling
of
being
merely
a
crawling
insect
anne
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
do
you
remember
the
first
time
i
took
you
for
a
buggy
ride
in
avonlea
that
night
we
went
to
the
carmody
concert
the
first
fall
you
taught
in
avonlea
i
had
out
little
black
mare
with
the
white
star
on
her
forehead
and
a
shining
buggy
and
i
was
the
proudest
fellow
in
the
world
barring
none
i
suppose
our
grandson
will
be
taking
his
sweetheart
out
quite
casually
for
an
evening
in
his
aeroplane
an
aeroplane
wo
be
as
nice
as
little
silverspot
was
said
anne
a
machine
is
simply
a
machine
but
silverspot
why
she
was
a
personality
gilbert
a
drive
behind
her
had
something
in
it
that
not
even
a
flight
among
sunset
clouds
could
have
no
i
do
envy
my
sweetheart
after
all
meredith
is
right
kingdom
of
heaven
and
of
love
and
of
happiness
does
depend
on
externals
besides
said
the
doctor
gravely
our
said
grandson
will
have
to
give
most
of
his
attention
to
the
aeroplane
he
wo
be
able
to
let
the
reins
lie
on
its
back
while
he
gazes
into
his
lady
eyes
and
i
have
an
awful
suspicion
that
you
ca
run
an
aeroplane
with
one
arm
no
the
doctor
shook
his
head
i
believe
i
still
prefer
silverspot
after
all
the
russian
line
broke
again
that
summer
and
susan
said
bitterly
that
she
had
expected
it
ever
since
kerensky
had
gone
and
got
married
far
be
it
from
me
to
decry
the
holy
state
of
matrimony
dear
but
i
felt
that
when
a
man
was
running
a
revolution
he
had
his
hands
full
and
should
have
postponed
marriage
until
a
more
fitting
season
the
russians
are
done
for
this
time
and
there
would
be
no
sense
in
shutting
our
eyes
to
the
fact
but
have
you
seen
woodrow
wilson
reply
to
the
pope
peace
proposals
it
is
magnificent
i
really
could
not
have
expressed
the
rights
of
the
matter
better
myself
i
feel
that
i
can
forgive
wilson
everything
for
it
he
knows
the
meaning
of
words
and
that
you
may
tie
to
speaking
of
meanings
have
you
heard
the
latest
story
about
dear
it
seems
he
was
over
at
the
lowbridge
road
school
the
other
day
and
took
a
notion
to
examine
the
fourth
class
in
spelling
they
have
the
summer
term
there
yet
you
know
with
the
spring
and
fall
vacations
being
rather
backward
people
on
that
road
my
niece
ella
baker
goes
to
that
school
and
she
it
was
who
told
me
the
story
the
teacher
was
not
feeling
well
having
a
dreadful
headache
and
she
went
out
to
get
a
little
fresh
air
while
pryor
was
examining
the
class
the
children
got
along
all
right
with
the
spelling
but
when
whiskers
began
to
question
them
about
the
meanings
of
the
words
they
were
all
at
sea
because
they
had
not
learned
them
ella
and
the
other
big
scholars
felt
terrible
over
it
they
love
their
teacher
so
and
it
seems
pryor
brother
abel
pryor
who
is
trustee
of
that
school
is
against
her
and
has
been
trying
to
turn
the
other
trustees
over
to
his
way
of
thinking
and
ella
and
the
rest
were
afraid
that
if
the
fourth
class
could
tell
whiskers
the
meanings
of
the
words
he
would
think
the
teacher
was
no
good
and
tell
abel
so
and
abel
would
have
a
fine
handle
but
little
sandy
logan
saved
the
situation
he
is
a
home
boy
but
he
is
as
smart
as
a
steel
trap
and
he
sized
up
right
off
does
anatomy
mean
whiskers
demanded
pain
in
your
stomach
sandy
replied
quick
as
a
flash
and
never
batting
an
eyelid
is
a
very
ignorant
man
dear
he
know
the
meaning
of
the
words
himself
and
he
said
good
very
good
the
class
caught
right
on
at
least
three
or
four
of
the
brighter
ones
did
and
they
kept
up
the
fun
jean
blane
said
that
meant
religious
squabble
and
muriel
baker
said
that
an
was
man
who
had
indigestion
and
jim
carter
said
that
meant
that
ate
nothing
but
vegetable
food
and
so
on
all
down
the
list
whiskers
swallowed
it
all
and
kept
saying
good
very
good
until
ella
thought
that
die
she
would
trying
to
keep
a
straight
face
when
the
teacher
came
in
whiskers
complimented
her
on
the
splendid
understanding
the
children
had
of
their
lesson
and
said
he
meant
to
tell
the
trustees
what
a
jewel
they
had
it
was
unusual
he
said
to
find
a
fourth
class
who
could
answer
up
so
prompt
when
it
came
to
explaining
what
words
meant
he
went
off
beaming
but
ella
told
me
this
as
a
great
secret
dear
and
we
must
keep
it
as
such
for
the
sake
of
the
lowbridge
road
teacher
it
would
likely
be
the
ruin
of
her
chances
of
keeping
the
school
if
whiskers
should
ever
find
out
how
he
had
been
bamboozled
mary
vance
came
up
to
ingleside
that
same
afternoon
to
tell
them
that
miller
douglas
who
had
been
wounded
when
the
canadians
took
hill
had
had
to
have
his
leg
amputated
the
ingleside
folk
sympathized
with
mary
whose
zeal
and
patriotism
had
taken
some
time
to
kindle
but
now
burned
with
a
glow
as
steady
and
bright
as
any
one
some
folks
have
been
twitting
me
about
having
a
husband
with
only
one
leg
but
said
mary
rising
to
a
lofty
height
i
would
rather
miller
with
only
one
leg
than
any
other
man
in
the
world
with
a
dozen
unless
she
added
as
an
unless
it
was
lloyd
george
well
i
must
be
going
i
thought
you
be
interested
in
hearing
about
miller
so
i
ran
up
from
the
store
but
i
must
hustle
home
for
i
promised
luke
macallister
i
help
him
build
his
grain
stack
this
evening
it
up
to
us
girls
to
see
that
the
harvest
is
got
in
since
the
boys
are
so
scarce
i
got
overalls
and
i
can
tell
you
real
becoming
alec
douglas
says
they
indecent
and
should
be
allowed
and
even
elliott
kinder
looks
askance
at
them
but
bless
you
the
world
moves
and
anyhow
there
no
fun
for
me
like
shocking
kitty
alec
by
the
way
father
said
rilla
i
going
to
take
jack
flagg
place
in
his
father
store
for
a
month
i
promised
him
today
that
i
would
if
you
did
object
then
he
can
help
the
farmers
get
the
harvest
in
i
do
think
i
be
much
use
in
a
harvest
myself
though
lots
of
the
girls
are
but
i
can
set
jack
free
while
i
do
his
work
jims
is
much
bother
in
the
daytime
now
and
i
always
be
home
at
night
do
you
think
you
like
weighing
out
sugar
and
beans
and
trafficking
in
butter
and
eggs
said
the
doctor
twinkling
probably
not
that
is
the
question
it
just
one
way
of
doing
my
bit
so
rilla
went
behind
flagg
counter
for
a
month
and
susan
went
into
albert
crawford
i
am
as
good
as
any
of
them
yet
she
said
proudly
not
a
man
of
them
can
beat
me
when
it
comes
to
building
a
stack
when
i
offered
to
help
albert
looked
doubtful
am
afraid
the
work
will
be
too
hard
for
you
he
said
me
for
a
day
and
see
said
i
will
do
my
darnedest
none
of
the
ingleside
folks
spoke
for
just
a
moment
their
silence
meant
that
they
thought
susan
pluck
in
working
out
quite
wonderful
but
susan
mistook
their
meaning
and
her
face
grew
red
this
habit
of
swearing
seems
to
be
growing
on
me
dear
she
said
apologetically
to
think
that
i
should
be
acquiring
it
at
my
age
it
is
such
a
dreadful
example
to
the
young
girls
i
am
of
the
opinion
it
comes
of
reading
the
newspapers
so
much
they
are
so
full
of
profanity
and
they
do
not
spell
it
with
stars
either
as
used
to
be
done
in
my
young
days
this
war
is
demoralizing
everybody
susan
standing
on
a
load
of
grain
her
grey
hair
whipping
in
the
breeze
and
her
skirt
kilted
up
to
her
knees
for
safety
and
convenience
no
overalls
for
susan
if
you
please
neither
a
beautiful
nor
a
romantic
figure
but
the
spirit
that
animated
her
gaunt
arms
was
the
one
that
captured
vimy
ridge
and
held
the
german
legions
back
from
verdun
it
is
not
the
least
likely
however
that
this
consideration
was
the
one
which
appealed
most
strongly
to
pryor
when
he
drove
past
one
afternoon
and
saw
susan
pitching
sheaves
gamely
smart
woman
that
he
reflected
worth
two
of
many
a
younger
one
yet
i
might
do
worse
i
might
do
worse
if
milgrave
comes
home
alive
lose
miranda
and
hired
housekeepers
cost
more
than
a
wife
and
are
liable
to
leave
a
man
in
the
lurch
any
time
i
think
it
over
a
week
later
blythe
coming
up
from
the
village
late
in
the
afternoon
paused
at
the
gate
of
ingleside
in
an
amazement
which
temporarily
bereft
her
of
the
power
of
motion
an
extraordinary
sight
met
her
eyes
round
the
end
of
the
kitchen
burst
pryor
running
as
stout
pompous
pryor
had
not
run
in
years
with
terror
imprinted
on
every
lineament
a
terror
quite
justifiable
for
behind
him
like
an
avenging
fate
came
susan
with
a
huge
smoking
iron
pot
grasped
in
her
hands
and
an
expression
in
her
eye
that
boded
ill
to
the
object
of
her
indignation
if
she
should
overtake
him
pursuer
and
pursued
tore
across
the
lawn
pryor
reached
the
gate
a
few
feet
ahead
of
susan
wrenched
it
open
and
fled
down
the
road
without
a
glance
at
the
transfixed
lady
of
ingleside
susan
gasped
anne
susan
halted
in
her
mad
career
set
down
her
pot
and
shook
her
fist
after
pryor
who
had
not
ceased
to
run
evidently
believing
that
susan
was
still
full
cry
after
him
susan
what
does
this
mean
demanded
anne
a
little
severely
you
may
well
ask
that
dear
susan
replied
wrathfully
i
have
not
been
so
upset
in
years
that
that
that
pacifist
has
actually
had
the
audacity
to
come
up
here
and
in
my
own
kitchen
to
ask
me
to
marry
him
him
anne
choked
back
a
laugh
but
susan
could
you
have
found
a
well
a
less
spectacular
method
of
refusing
him
think
what
a
gossip
this
would
have
made
if
anyone
had
been
going
past
and
had
seen
such
a
performance
indeed
dear
you
are
quite
right
i
did
not
think
of
it
because
i
was
quite
past
thinking
rationally
i
was
just
clean
mad
come
in
the
house
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
susan
picked
up
her
pot
and
marched
into
the
kitchen
still
trembling
with
wrathful
excitement
she
set
her
pot
on
the
stove
with
a
vicious
thud
wait
a
moment
until
i
open
all
the
windows
to
air
this
kitchen
well
dear
there
that
is
better
and
i
must
wash
my
hands
too
because
i
shook
hands
with
when
he
came
in
not
that
i
wanted
to
but
when
he
stuck
out
his
fat
oily
hand
i
did
not
know
just
what
else
to
do
at
the
moment
i
had
just
finished
my
afternoon
cleaning
and
thanks
be
everything
was
shining
and
spotless
and
thought
i
that
dye
is
boiling
and
i
will
get
my
rug
rags
and
have
them
nicely
out
of
the
way
before
supper
just
then
a
shadow
fell
over
the
floor
and
looking
up
i
saw
standing
in
the
doorway
dressed
up
and
looking
as
if
he
had
just
been
starched
and
ironed
i
shook
hands
with
him
as
aforesaid
dear
and
told
him
you
and
the
doctor
were
both
away
but
he
said
i
have
come
to
see
you
miss
baker
i
asked
him
to
sit
down
for
the
sake
of
my
own
manners
and
then
i
stood
there
right
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
gazed
at
him
as
contemptuously
as
i
could
in
spite
of
his
brazen
assurance
this
seemed
to
rattle
him
a
little
but
he
began
trying
to
look
sentimental
at
me
out
of
his
little
piggy
eyes
and
all
at
once
an
awful
suspicion
flashed
into
my
mind
something
told
me
dear
that
i
was
about
to
receive
my
first
proposal
i
have
always
thought
that
i
would
like
to
have
just
one
offer
of
marriage
to
reject
so
that
i
might
be
able
to
look
other
women
in
the
face
but
you
will
not
hear
me
bragging
of
this
i
consider
it
an
insult
and
if
i
could
have
thought
of
any
way
of
preventing
it
i
would
but
just
then
dear
you
will
see
i
was
at
a
disadvantage
being
taken
so
completely
by
surprise
some
men
i
am
told
consider
a
little
preliminary
courting
the
proper
thing
before
a
proposal
if
only
to
give
fair
warning
of
their
intentions
but
probably
thought
it
was
any
port
in
a
storm
for
me
and
that
i
would
jump
at
him
well
he
is
undeceived
yes
he
is
undeceived
dear
i
wonder
if
he
has
stopped
running
yet
i
understand
that
you
do
feel
flattered
susan
but
could
you
have
refused
him
a
little
more
delicately
than
by
chasing
him
off
the
premises
in
such
a
fashion
well
maybe
i
might
have
dear
and
i
intended
to
but
one
remark
he
made
aggravated
me
beyond
my
powers
of
endurance
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
i
would
not
have
chased
him
with
my
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
interview
whiskers
sat
down
as
i
have
said
and
right
beside
him
on
another
chair
doc
was
lying
the
animal
was
pretending
to
be
asleep
but
i
knew
very
well
he
was
not
for
he
has
been
hyde
all
day
and
hyde
never
sleeps
by
the
way
dear
have
you
noticed
that
that
cat
is
far
oftener
hyde
than
jekyll
now
the
more
victories
germany
wins
the
hyder
he
becomes
i
leave
you
to
draw
your
own
conclusions
from
that
i
suppose
whiskers
thought
he
might
curry
favour
with
me
by
praising
the
creature
little
dreaming
what
my
real
sentiments
towards
it
were
so
he
stuck
out
his
pudgy
hand
and
stroked
hyde
back
a
nice
cat
he
said
the
nice
cat
flew
at
him
and
bit
him
then
it
gave
a
fearful
yowl
and
bounded
out
of
the
door
whiskers
looked
after
it
quite
amazed
is
a
queer
kind
of
a
varmint
he
said
i
agreed
with
him
on
that
point
but
i
was
not
going
to
let
him
see
it
besides
what
business
had
he
to
call
our
cat
a
varmint
may
be
a
varmint
or
it
may
not
i
said
it
knows
the
difference
between
a
canadian
and
a
hun
you
would
have
thought
would
you
not
dear
that
a
hint
like
that
would
have
been
enough
for
him
but
it
went
no
deeper
than
his
skin
i
saw
him
settling
back
quite
comfortable
as
if
for
a
good
talk
and
thought
i
there
is
anything
coming
it
may
as
well
come
soon
and
be
done
with
for
with
all
these
rags
to
dye
before
supper
i
have
no
time
to
waste
in
flirting
so
i
spoke
right
out
you
have
anything
particular
to
discuss
with
me
pryor
i
would
feel
obliged
if
you
would
mention
it
without
loss
of
time
because
i
am
very
busy
this
afternoon
he
fairly
beamed
at
me
out
of
that
circle
of
red
whisker
and
said
are
a
woman
and
i
agree
with
you
there
is
no
use
in
wasting
time
beating
around
the
bush
i
came
up
here
today
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
so
there
it
was
dear
i
had
a
proposal
at
last
after
waiting
years
for
one
i
just
glared
at
that
presumptuous
creature
and
i
said
would
not
marry
you
if
you
were
the
last
man
on
earth
josiah
pryor
so
there
you
have
my
answer
and
you
can
take
it
away
forthwith
you
never
saw
a
man
so
taken
aback
as
he
was
dear
he
was
so
flabbergasted
that
he
just
blurted
out
the
truth
i
thought
you
be
only
too
glad
to
get
a
chance
to
be
married
he
said
that
was
when
i
lost
my
head
dear
do
you
think
i
had
a
good
excuse
when
a
hun
and
a
pacifist
made
such
an
insulting
remark
to
me
i
thundered
and
i
just
caught
up
that
iron
pot
i
could
see
that
he
thought
i
had
suddenly
gone
insane
and
i
suppose
he
considered
an
iron
pot
full
of
boiling
dye
was
a
dangerous
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
lunatic
at
any
rate
he
went
and
stood
not
upon
the
order
of
his
going
as
you
saw
for
yourself
and
i
do
not
think
we
will
see
him
back
here
proposing
to
us
again
in
a
hurry
no
i
think
he
has
learned
that
there
is
at
least
one
single
woman
in
glen
mary
who
has
no
hankering
to
become
mrs
chapter
xxvii
waiting
ingleside
november
it
is
november
and
the
glen
is
all
grey
and
brown
except
where
the
lombardy
poplars
stand
up
here
and
there
like
great
golden
torches
in
the
sombre
landscape
although
every
other
tree
has
shed
its
leaves
it
has
been
very
hard
to
keep
our
courage
alight
of
late
the
caporetto
disaster
is
a
dreadful
thing
and
not
even
susan
can
extract
much
consolation
out
of
the
present
state
of
affairs
the
rest
of
us
try
gertrude
keeps
saying
desperately
must
not
get
venice
they
must
not
get
venice
as
if
by
saying
it
often
enough
she
can
prevent
them
but
what
is
to
prevent
them
from
getting
venice
i
can
not
see
yet
as
susan
fails
not
to
point
out
there
was
seemingly
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
getting
to
paris
in
yet
they
did
not
get
it
and
she
affirms
they
shall
not
get
venice
either
oh
how
i
hope
and
pray
they
will
not
venice
the
beautiful
queen
of
the
adriatic
although
i
never
seen
it
i
feel
about
it
just
as
byron
did
always
loved
it
it
has
always
been
to
me
fairy
city
of
the
heart
perhaps
i
caught
my
love
of
it
from
walter
who
worshipped
it
it
was
always
one
of
his
dreams
to
see
venice
i
remember
we
planned
once
down
in
rainbow
valley
one
evening
just
before
the
war
broke
out
that
some
time
we
would
go
together
to
see
it
and
float
in
a
gondola
through
its
moonlit
streets
every
fall
since
the
war
began
there
has
been
some
terrible
blow
to
our
troops
antwerp
in
serbia
in
last
fall
rumania
and
now
italy
the
worst
of
all
i
think
i
would
give
up
in
despair
if
it
were
not
for
what
walter
said
in
his
dear
last
letter
that
dead
as
well
as
the
living
were
fighting
on
our
side
and
such
an
army
can
not
be
defeated
no
it
can
not
we
will
win
in
the
end
i
will
not
doubt
it
for
one
moment
to
let
myself
doubt
would
be
to
faith
we
have
all
been
campaigning
furiously
of
late
for
the
new
victory
loan
we
junior
reds
canvassed
diligently
and
landed
several
tough
old
customers
who
had
at
first
flatly
refused
to
invest
i
even
i
tackled
i
expected
a
bad
time
and
a
refusal
but
to
my
amazement
he
was
quite
agreeable
and
promised
on
the
spot
to
take
a
thousand
dollar
bond
he
may
be
a
pacifist
but
he
knows
a
good
investment
when
it
is
handed
out
to
him
five
and
a
half
per
cent
is
five
and
a
half
per
cent
even
when
a
militaristic
government
pays
it
father
to
tease
susan
says
it
was
her
speech
at
the
victory
loan
campaign
meeting
that
converted
pryor
i
do
think
that
at
all
likely
since
pryor
has
been
publicly
very
bitter
against
susan
ever
since
her
quite
unmistakable
rejection
of
his
advances
but
susan
did
make
a
speech
and
the
best
one
made
at
the
meeting
too
it
was
the
first
time
she
ever
did
such
a
thing
and
she
vows
it
will
be
the
last
everybody
in
the
glen
was
at
the
meeting
and
quite
a
number
of
speeches
were
made
but
somehow
things
were
a
little
flat
and
no
especial
enthusiasm
could
be
worked
up
susan
was
quite
dismayed
at
the
lack
of
zeal
because
she
had
been
burningly
anxious
that
the
island
should
go
over
the
top
in
regard
to
its
quota
she
kept
whispering
viciously
to
gertrude
and
me
that
there
was
ginger
in
the
speeches
and
when
nobody
went
forward
to
subscribe
to
the
loan
at
the
close
susan
her
head
at
least
that
is
how
she
describes
it
herself
she
bounded
to
her
feet
her
face
grim
and
set
under
her
bonnet
susan
is
the
only
woman
in
glen
mary
who
still
wears
a
bonnet
and
said
sarcastically
and
loudly
doubt
it
is
much
cheaper
to
talk
patriotism
than
it
is
to
pay
for
it
and
we
are
asking
charity
of
course
we
are
asking
you
to
lend
us
your
money
for
nothing
no
doubt
the
kaiser
will
feel
quite
downcast
when
he
hears
of
this
meeting
susan
has
an
unshaken
belief
that
the
kaiser
spies
presumably
represented
by
pryor
promptly
inform
him
of
every
happening
in
our
glen
norman
douglas
shouted
out
hear
and
some
boy
at
the
back
said
about
lloyd
george
in
a
tone
susan
did
like
lloyd
george
is
her
pet
hero
now
that
kitchener
is
gone
stand
behind
lloyd
george
every
time
retorted
susan
suppose
that
will
hearten
him
up
greatly
said
warren
mead
with
one
of
his
disagreeable
warren
remark
was
spark
to
powder
susan
just
in
as
she
puts
it
and
her
say
she
said
it
remarkably
well
too
there
was
no
lack
of
in
her
speech
anyhow
when
susan
is
warmed
up
she
has
no
mean
powers
of
oratory
and
the
way
she
trimmed
those
men
down
was
funny
and
wonderful
and
effective
all
at
once
she
said
it
was
the
likes
of
her
millions
of
her
that
did
stand
behind
lloyd
george
and
did
hearten
him
up
that
was
the
of
her
speech
dear
old
susan
she
is
a
perfect
dynamo
of
patriotism
and
loyalty
and
contempt
for
slackers
of
all
kinds
and
when
she
let
it
loose
on
that
audience
in
her
one
grand
outburst
she
electrified
it
susan
always
vows
she
is
no
suffragette
but
she
gave
womanhood
its
due
that
night
and
she
literally
made
those
men
cringe
when
she
finished
with
them
they
were
ready
to
eat
out
of
her
hand
she
wound
up
by
ordering
them
yes
ordering
them
to
march
up
to
the
platform
forthwith
and
subscribe
for
victory
bonds
and
after
wild
applause
most
of
them
did
it
even
warren
mead
when
the
total
amount
subscribed
came
out
in
the
charlottetown
dailies
the
next
day
we
found
that
the
glen
led
every
district
on
the
island
and
certainly
susan
has
the
credit
for
it
she
herself
after
she
came
home
that
night
was
quite
ashamed
and
evidently
feared
that
she
had
been
guilty
of
unbecoming
conduct
she
confessed
to
mother
that
she
had
been
unladylike
we
were
all
except
susan
out
for
a
trial
ride
in
father
new
automobile
tonight
a
very
good
one
we
had
too
though
we
did
get
ingloriously
ditched
at
the
end
owing
to
a
certain
grim
old
dame
to
wit
miss
elizabeth
carr
of
the
upper
glen
who
would
rein
her
horse
out
to
let
us
pass
honk
as
we
might
father
was
quite
furious
but
in
my
heart
i
believe
i
sympathized
with
miss
elizabeth
if
i
had
been
a
spinster
lady
driving
along
behind
my
own
old
nag
in
maiden
meditation
fancy
free
i
would
have
lifted
a
rein
when
an
obstreperous
car
hooted
blatantly
behind
me
i
should
just
have
sat
up
as
dourly
as
she
did
and
said
the
ditch
if
you
are
determined
to
pass
we
did
take
the
ditch
and
got
up
to
our
axles
in
sand
and
sat
foolishly
there
while
miss
elizabeth
clucked
up
her
horse
and
rattled
victoriously
away
jem
will
have
a
laugh
when
i
write
him
this
he
knows
miss
elizabeth
of
old
but
will
venice
be
saved
november
it
is
not
saved
yet
it
is
still
in
great
danger
but
the
italians
are
making
a
stand
at
last
on
the
piave
line
to
be
sure
military
critics
say
they
can
not
possibly
hold
it
and
must
retreat
to
the
adige
but
susan
and
gertrude
and
i
say
they
must
hold
it
because
venice
must
be
saved
so
what
are
the
military
critics
to
do
oh
if
i
could
only
believe
that
they
can
hold
it
our
canadian
troops
have
won
another
great
victory
they
have
stormed
the
passchendaele
ridge
and
held
it
in
the
face
of
all
counter
attacks
none
of
our
boys
were
in
the
battle
but
oh
the
casualty
list
of
other
people
boys
joe
milgrave
was
in
it
but
came
through
safe
miranda
had
some
bad
days
until
she
got
word
from
him
but
it
is
wonderful
how
miranda
has
bloomed
out
since
her
marriage
she
is
the
same
girl
at
all
even
her
eyes
seem
to
have
darkened
and
deepened
though
i
suppose
that
is
just
because
they
glow
with
the
greater
intensity
that
has
come
to
her
she
makes
her
father
stand
round
in
a
perfectly
amazing
fashion
she
runs
up
the
flag
whenever
a
yard
of
trench
on
the
western
front
is
taken
and
she
comes
up
regularly
to
our
junior
red
cross
and
she
does
yes
she
does
put
on
funny
little
woman
airs
that
are
quite
killing
but
she
is
the
only
in
the
glen
and
surely
nobody
need
grudge
her
the
satisfaction
she
gets
out
of
it
the
russian
news
is
bad
too
kerensky
government
has
fallen
and
lenin
is
dictator
of
russia
somehow
it
is
very
hard
to
keep
up
courage
in
the
dull
hopelessness
of
these
grey
autumn
days
of
suspense
and
boding
news
but
we
are
beginning
to
in
a
low
as
old
highland
sandy
says
over
the
approaching
election
conscription
is
the
real
issue
at
stake
and
it
will
be
the
most
exciting
election
we
ever
had
all
the
women
have
got
de
age
to
quote
jo
poirier
and
who
have
husbands
sons
and
brothers
at
the
front
can
vote
oh
if
i
were
only
gertrude
and
susan
are
both
furious
because
they
vote
is
not
fair
gertrude
says
passionately
is
agnes
carr
who
can
vote
because
her
husband
went
she
did
everything
she
could
to
prevent
him
from
going
and
now
she
is
going
to
vote
against
the
union
government
yet
i
have
no
vote
because
my
man
at
the
front
is
only
my
sweetheart
and
not
my
husband
as
for
susan
when
she
reflects
that
she
can
not
vote
while
a
rank
old
pacifist
like
pryor
can
and
will
her
comments
are
sulphurous
i
really
feel
sorry
for
the
elliotts
and
crawfords
and
macallisters
they
have
always
lined
up
in
clearly
divided
camps
of
liberal
and
conservative
and
now
they
are
torn
from
their
moorings
i
know
i
mixing
my
metaphors
dreadfully
and
set
hopelessly
adrift
it
will
kill
some
of
those
old
grits
to
vote
for
sir
robert
side
and
yet
they
have
to
because
they
believe
the
time
has
come
when
we
must
have
conscription
and
some
poor
conservatives
who
are
against
conscription
must
vote
for
laurier
who
always
has
been
anathema
to
them
some
of
them
are
taking
it
terribly
hard
others
seem
to
be
in
much
the
same
attitude
as
marshall
elliott
has
come
to
be
regarding
church
union
she
was
up
here
last
night
she
does
come
as
often
as
she
used
to
she
is
growing
too
old
to
walk
this
far
dear
old
cornelia
i
hate
to
think
of
her
growing
old
we
have
always
loved
her
so
and
she
has
always
been
so
good
to
us
ingleside
young
fry
she
used
to
be
so
bitterly
opposed
to
church
union
but
last
night
when
father
told
her
it
was
practically
decided
she
said
in
a
resigned
tone
in
a
world
where
everything
is
being
rent
and
torn
what
matters
one
more
rending
and
tearing
anyhow
compared
with
germans
even
methodists
seem
attractive
to
me
our
junior
goes
on
quite
smoothly
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
irene
has
come
back
to
it
having
fallen
out
with
the
lowbridge
society
i
understand
she
gave
me
a
sweet
little
jab
last
meeting
about
knowing
me
across
the
square
in
charlottetown
my
green
velvet
hat
everybody
knows
me
by
that
detestable
and
detested
hat
this
will
be
my
fourth
season
for
it
even
mother
wanted
me
to
get
a
new
one
this
fall
but
i
said
as
long
as
the
war
lasts
so
long
do
i
wear
that
velvet
hat
in
winter
november
the
piave
line
still
holds
and
general
byng
has
won
a
splendid
victory
at
cambrai
i
did
run
up
the
flag
for
that
but
susan
only
said
shall
set
a
kettle
of
water
on
the
kitchen
range
tonight
i
notice
little
kitchener
always
has
an
attack
of
croup
after
any
british
victory
i
do
hope
he
has
no
blood
in
his
veins
nobody
knows
much
about
his
father
people
jims
has
had
a
few
attacks
of
croup
this
fall
just
the
ordinary
croup
not
that
terrible
thing
he
had
last
year
but
whatever
blood
runs
in
his
little
veins
it
is
good
healthy
blood
he
is
rosy
and
plump
and
curly
and
cute
and
he
says
such
funny
things
and
asks
such
comical
questions
he
likes
very
much
to
sit
in
a
special
chair
in
the
kitchen
but
that
is
susan
favourite
chair
too
and
when
she
wants
it
out
jims
must
go
the
last
time
she
put
him
out
of
it
he
turned
around
and
asked
solemnly
you
are
dead
susan
can
i
sit
in
that
chair
susan
thought
it
quite
dreadful
and
i
think
that
was
when
she
began
to
feel
anxiety
about
his
possible
ancestry
the
other
night
i
took
jims
with
me
for
a
walk
down
to
the
store
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
out
so
late
at
night
and
when
he
saw
the
stars
he
exclaimed
willa
see
the
big
moon
and
all
the
little
moons
and
last
wednesday
morning
when
he
woke
up
my
little
alarm
clock
had
stopped
because
i
had
forgotten
to
wind
it
up
jims
bounded
out
of
his
crib
and
ran
across
to
me
his
face
quite
aghast
above
his
little
blue
flannel
pyjamas
clock
is
dead
he
gasped
willa
the
clock
is
dead
one
night
he
was
quite
angry
with
both
susan
and
me
because
we
would
not
give
him
something
he
wanted
very
much
when
he
said
his
prayers
he
plumped
down
wrathfully
and
when
he
came
to
the
petition
me
a
good
boy
he
tacked
on
emphatically
please
make
willa
and
susan
good
they
not
i
do
go
about
quoting
jims
speeches
to
all
i
meet
that
always
bores
me
when
other
people
do
it
i
just
enshrine
them
in
this
old
of
a
journal
this
very
evening
as
i
put
jims
to
bed
he
looked
up
and
asked
me
gravely
ca
yesterday
come
back
willa
oh
why
ca
it
jims
that
beautiful
of
dreams
and
laughter
when
our
boys
were
home
when
walter
and
i
read
and
rambled
and
watched
new
moons
and
sunsets
together
in
rainbow
valley
if
it
could
just
come
back
but
yesterdays
never
come
back
little
jims
and
the
todays
are
dark
with
clouds
and
we
dare
not
think
about
the
tomorrows
december
wonderful
news
came
today
the
british
troops
captured
jerusalem
yesterday
we
ran
up
the
flag
and
some
of
gertrude
old
sparkle
came
back
to
her
for
a
moment
all
she
said
is
worth
while
to
live
in
the
days
which
see
the
object
of
the
crusades
attained
the
ghosts
of
all
the
crusaders
must
have
crowded
the
walls
of
jerusalem
last
night
with
at
their
head
susan
had
cause
for
satisfaction
also
am
so
thankful
i
can
pronounce
jerusalem
and
hebron
she
said
give
me
a
real
comfortable
feeling
after
przemysl
and
well
we
have
got
the
turks
on
the
run
at
least
and
venice
is
safe
and
lord
lansdowne
is
not
to
be
taken
seriously
and
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
be
downhearted
jerusalem
the
flag
of
england
floats
over
you
the
crescent
is
gone
how
walter
would
have
thrilled
over
that
december
yesterday
the
election
came
off
in
the
evening
mother
and
susan
and
gertrude
and
i
forgathered
in
the
and
waited
in
breathless
suspense
father
having
gone
down
to
the
village
we
had
no
way
of
hearing
the
news
for
carter
flagg
store
is
not
on
our
line
and
when
we
tried
to
get
it
central
always
answered
that
the
line
busy
as
no
doubt
it
was
for
everybody
for
miles
around
was
trying
to
get
carter
store
for
the
same
reason
we
were
about
ten
gertrude
went
to
the
and
happened
to
catch
someone
from
talking
to
carter
flagg
gertrude
shamelessly
listened
in
and
got
for
her
comforting
what
eavesdroppers
are
proverbially
supposed
to
get
to
wit
unpleasant
hearing
the
union
government
had
nothing
in
the
west
we
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
if
the
government
had
failed
to
carry
the
west
it
was
defeated
is
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
said
gertrude
bitterly
everybody
was
like
the
mark
crawfords
this
would
not
have
happened
groaned
susan
locked
their
uncle
up
in
the
barn
this
morning
and
would
not
let
him
out
until
he
promised
to
vote
union
that
is
what
i
call
effective
argument
dr
dear
gertrude
and
i
could
rest
after
all
that
we
walked
the
floor
until
our
legs
gave
out
and
we
had
to
sit
down
perforce
mother
knitted
away
as
steadily
as
clockwork
and
pretended
to
be
calm
and
serene
pretended
so
well
that
we
were
all
deceived
and
envious
until
the
next
day
when
i
caught
her
ravelling
out
four
inches
of
her
sock
she
had
knit
that
far
past
where
the
heel
should
have
begun
it
was
twelve
before
father
came
home
he
stood
in
the
doorway
and
looked
at
us
and
we
looked
at
him
we
did
not
dare
ask
him
what
the
news
was
then
he
said
that
it
was
laurier
who
had
nothing
in
the
west
and
that
the
union
government
was
in
with
a
big
majority
gertrude
clapped
her
hands
i
wanted
to
laugh
and
cry
mother
eyes
flashed
with
their
starriness
and
susan
emitted
a
queer
sound
between
a
gasp
and
a
whoop
this
will
not
comfort
the
kaiser
much
she
said
then
we
went
to
bed
but
were
too
excited
to
sleep
really
as
susan
said
solemnly
this
morning
dear
i
think
politics
are
too
strenuous
for
women
december
our
fourth
war
christmas
is
over
we
are
trying
to
gather
up
some
courage
wherewith
to
face
another
year
of
it
germany
has
for
the
most
part
been
victorious
all
summer
and
now
they
say
she
has
all
her
troops
from
the
russian
front
ready
for
a
push
in
the
spring
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
we
just
can
not
live
through
the
winter
waiting
for
that
i
had
a
great
batch
of
letters
from
overseas
this
week
shirley
is
at
the
front
now
too
and
writes
about
it
all
as
coolly
and
as
he
used
to
write
of
football
at
queen
carl
wrote
that
it
had
been
raining
for
weeks
and
that
nights
in
the
trenches
always
made
him
think
of
the
night
of
long
ago
when
he
did
penance
in
the
graveyard
for
running
away
from
henry
warren
ghost
letters
are
always
full
of
jokes
and
bits
of
fun
they
had
a
great
the
night
before
he
wrote
spearing
rats
with
their
bayonets
and
he
got
the
best
bag
and
won
the
prize
he
has
a
tame
rat
that
knows
him
and
sleeps
in
his
pocket
at
night
rats
do
worry
carl
as
they
do
some
people
he
was
always
chummy
with
all
little
beasts
he
says
he
is
making
a
study
of
the
habits
of
the
trench
rat
and
means
to
write
a
treatise
on
it
some
day
that
will
make
him
famous
ken
wrote
a
short
letter
his
letters
are
all
rather
short
now
and
he
does
often
slip
in
those
dear
little
sudden
sentences
i
love
so
much
sometimes
i
think
he
has
forgotten
all
about
the
night
he
was
here
to
say
goodbye
and
then
there
will
be
just
a
line
or
a
word
that
makes
me
think
he
remembers
and
always
will
remember
for
instance
letter
had
a
thing
in
it
that
might
have
been
written
to
any
girl
except
that
he
signed
himself
kenneth
instead
of
kenneth
as
he
usually
does
now
did
he
leave
that
off
intentionally
or
was
it
only
carelessness
i
shall
lie
awake
half
the
night
wondering
he
is
a
captain
now
i
am
glad
and
proud
and
yet
captain
ford
sounds
so
horribly
far
away
and
high
up
ken
and
captain
ford
seem
like
two
different
persons
i
may
be
practically
engaged
to
ken
mother
opinion
on
that
point
is
my
stay
and
bulwark
but
i
be
to
captain
ford
and
jem
is
a
lieutenant
now
won
his
promotion
on
the
field
he
sent
me
a
taken
in
his
new
uniform
he
looked
thin
and
old
old
my
jem
i
ca
forget
mother
face
when
i
showed
it
to
her
my
little
jem
the
baby
of
the
old
house
of
dreams
was
all
she
said
there
was
a
letter
from
faith
too
she
is
doing
work
in
england
and
writes
hopefully
and
brightly
i
think
she
is
almost
happy
she
saw
jem
on
his
last
leave
and
she
is
so
near
him
she
could
go
to
him
if
he
were
wounded
that
means
so
much
to
her
oh
if
i
were
only
with
her
but
my
work
is
here
at
home
i
know
walter
would
have
wanted
me
to
leave
mother
and
in
everything
i
try
to
faith
with
him
even
to
the
little
details
of
daily
life
walter
died
for
canada
i
must
live
for
her
that
is
what
he
asked
me
to
do
january
shall
anchor
my
soul
to
the
british
fleet
and
make
a
batch
of
bran
biscuits
said
susan
today
to
cousin
sophia
who
had
come
in
with
some
weird
tale
of
a
new
and
submarine
just
launched
by
germany
but
susan
is
a
somewhat
disgruntled
woman
at
present
owing
to
the
regulations
regarding
cookery
her
loyalty
to
the
union
government
is
being
sorely
tried
it
surmounted
the
first
strain
gallantly
when
the
order
about
flour
came
susan
said
quite
cheerfully
am
an
old
dog
to
be
learning
new
tricks
but
i
shall
learn
to
make
war
bread
if
it
will
help
defeat
the
huns
but
the
later
suggestions
went
against
susan
grain
had
it
not
been
for
father
decree
i
think
she
would
have
snapped
her
fingers
at
sir
robert
borden
about
trying
to
make
bricks
without
straw
dear
how
am
i
to
make
a
cake
without
butter
or
sugar
it
can
not
be
done
not
cake
that
is
cake
of
course
one
can
make
a
slab
dear
and
we
can
not
even
camooflash
it
with
a
little
icing
to
think
that
i
should
have
lived
to
see
the
day
when
a
government
at
ottawa
should
step
into
my
kitchen
and
put
me
on
rations
susan
would
give
the
last
drop
of
her
blood
for
her
and
country
but
to
surrender
her
beloved
recipes
is
a
very
different
and
much
more
serious
matter
i
had
letters
from
nan
and
di
too
or
rather
notes
they
are
too
busy
to
write
letters
for
exams
are
looming
up
they
will
graduate
in
arts
this
spring
i
am
evidently
to
be
the
dunce
of
the
family
but
somehow
i
never
had
any
hankering
for
a
college
course
and
even
now
it
appeal
to
me
i
afraid
i
rather
devoid
of
ambition
there
is
only
one
thing
i
really
want
to
be
and
i
do
know
if
i
be
it
or
not
if
not
i
do
want
to
be
anything
but
i
sha
write
it
down
it
is
all
right
to
think
it
but
as
cousin
sophia
would
say
it
might
be
brazen
to
write
it
down
i
will
write
it
down
i
wo
be
cowed
by
the
conventions
and
cousin
sophia
i
want
to
be
kenneth
ford
wife
there
now
i
just
looked
in
the
glass
and
i
had
the
sign
of
a
blush
on
my
face
i
suppose
i
not
a
properly
constructed
damsel
at
all
i
was
down
to
see
little
dog
monday
today
he
has
grown
quite
stiff
and
rheumatic
but
there
he
sat
waiting
for
the
train
he
thumped
his
tail
and
looked
pleadingly
into
my
eyes
will
jem
come
he
seemed
to
say
oh
dog
monday
there
is
no
answer
to
that
question
and
there
is
as
yet
no
answer
to
the
other
which
we
are
all
constantly
asking
will
happen
when
germany
strikes
again
on
the
western
front
her
one
great
last
blow
for
victory
march
will
spring
bring
gertrude
said
today
dread
it
as
i
never
dreaded
spring
before
do
you
suppose
there
will
ever
again
come
a
time
when
life
will
be
free
from
fear
for
almost
four
years
we
have
lain
down
with
fear
and
risen
up
with
it
it
has
been
the
unbidden
guest
at
every
meal
the
unwelcome
companion
at
every
gathering
says
he
will
be
in
paris
on
april
sighed
cousin
sophia
there
is
no
power
in
pen
and
ink
to
express
the
contempt
which
susan
infused
into
that
name
he
forgotten
what
day
the
first
of
april
is
has
kept
his
word
hitherto
said
gertrude
as
gloomily
as
cousin
sophia
herself
could
have
said
it
fighting
against
the
russians
and
rumanians
retorted
susan
you
till
he
comes
up
against
the
british
and
french
not
to
speak
of
the
yankees
who
are
getting
there
as
fast
as
they
can
and
will
no
doubt
give
a
good
account
of
themselves
said
just
the
same
thing
before
mons
susan
i
reminded
her
says
he
will
spend
a
million
lives
to
break
the
allied
front
said
gertrude
such
a
price
he
must
purchase
some
successes
and
how
can
we
live
through
them
even
if
he
is
baffled
in
the
end
these
past
two
months
when
we
have
been
crouching
and
waiting
for
the
blow
to
fall
have
seemed
as
long
as
all
the
preceding
months
of
the
war
put
together
i
work
all
day
feverishly
and
waken
at
three
at
night
to
wonder
if
the
iron
legions
have
struck
at
last
it
is
then
i
see
hindenburg
in
paris
and
germany
triumphant
i
never
see
her
so
at
any
other
time
than
that
accursed
hour
susan
looked
dubious
over
gertrude
adjective
but
evidently
concluded
that
the
saved
the
situation
wish
it
were
possible
to
take
some
magic
draught
and
go
to
sleep
for
the
next
three
months
and
then
waken
to
find
armageddon
over
said
mother
almost
impatiently
it
is
not
often
that
mother
slumps
into
a
wish
like
that
or
at
least
the
verbal
expression
of
it
mother
has
changed
a
great
deal
since
that
terrible
day
in
september
when
we
knew
that
walter
would
not
come
back
but
she
has
always
been
brave
and
patient
now
it
seemed
as
if
even
she
had
reached
the
limit
of
her
endurance
susan
went
over
to
mother
and
touched
her
shoulder
not
you
be
frightened
or
downhearted
dear
she
said
gently
felt
somewhat
that
way
myself
last
night
and
i
rose
from
my
bed
and
lighted
my
lamp
and
opened
my
bible
and
what
do
you
think
was
the
first
verse
my
eyes
lighted
upon
it
was
they
shall
fight
against
thee
but
they
shall
not
prevail
against
thee
for
i
am
with
thee
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
to
deliver
thee
i
am
not
gifted
in
the
way
of
dreaming
as
miss
oliver
is
but
i
knew
then
and
there
dear
that
it
was
a
manifest
leading
and
that
hindenburg
will
never
see
paris
so
i
read
no
further
but
went
back
to
my
bed
and
i
did
not
waken
at
three
or
at
any
other
hour
before
morning
i
say
that
verse
susan
read
over
and
over
again
to
myself
the
lord
of
hosts
is
with
us
and
the
spirits
of
all
just
men
made
perfect
and
even
the
legions
and
guns
that
germany
is
massing
on
the
western
front
must
break
against
such
a
barrier
this
is
in
certain
uplifted
moments
but
when
other
moments
come
i
feel
like
gertrude
that
i
can
not
endure
any
longer
this
awful
and
ominous
hush
before
the
coming
storm
march
armageddon
has
begun
last
great
fight
of
all
is
it
i
wonder
yesterday
i
went
down
to
the
post
office
for
the
mail
it
was
a
dull
bitter
day
the
snow
was
gone
but
the
grey
lifeless
ground
was
frozen
hard
and
a
biting
wind
was
blowing
the
whole
glen
landscape
was
ugly
and
hopeless
then
i
got
the
paper
with
its
big
black
headlines
germany
struck
on
the
she
makes
big
claims
of
guns
and
prisoners
taken
general
haig
reports
that
fighting
continues
i
do
like
the
sound
of
that
last
expression
we
all
find
we
can
not
do
any
work
that
requires
concentration
of
thought
so
we
all
knit
furiously
because
we
can
do
that
mechanically
at
least
the
dreadful
waiting
is
over
the
horrible
wondering
where
and
when
the
blow
will
fall
it
has
fallen
but
they
shall
not
prevail
against
us
oh
what
is
happening
on
the
western
front
tonight
as
i
write
this
sitting
here
in
my
room
with
my
journal
before
me
jims
is
asleep
in
his
crib
and
the
wind
is
wailing
around
the
window
over
my
desk
hangs
walter
picture
looking
at
me
with
his
beautiful
deep
eyes
the
mona
lisa
he
gave
me
the
last
christmas
he
was
home
hangs
on
one
side
of
it
and
on
the
other
a
framed
copy
of
the
piper
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
hear
walter
voice
repeating
it
that
little
poem
into
which
he
put
his
soul
and
which
will
therefore
live
for
ever
carrying
name
on
through
the
future
of
our
land
everything
about
me
is
calm
and
peaceful
and
walter
seems
very
near
me
if
i
could
just
sweep
aside
the
thin
wavering
little
veil
that
hangs
between
i
could
see
him
just
as
he
saw
the
pied
piper
the
night
before
courcelette
over
there
in
france
tonight
does
the
line
hold
chapter
xxviii
black
sunday
in
march
of
the
year
of
grace
there
was
one
week
into
which
must
have
crowded
more
of
searing
human
agony
than
any
seven
days
had
ever
held
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
in
that
week
there
was
one
day
when
all
humanity
seemed
nailed
to
the
cross
on
that
day
the
whole
planet
must
have
been
agroan
with
universal
convulsion
everywhere
the
hearts
of
men
were
failing
them
for
fear
it
dawned
calmly
and
coldly
and
greyly
at
ingleside
blythe
and
rilla
and
miss
oliver
made
ready
for
church
in
a
suspense
tempered
by
hope
and
confidence
the
doctor
was
away
having
been
summoned
during
the
wee
sma
to
the
marwood
household
in
upper
glen
where
a
little
was
fighting
gallantly
on
her
own
battleground
to
give
life
not
death
to
the
world
susan
announced
that
she
meant
to
stay
home
that
morning
a
rare
decision
for
susan
but
i
would
rather
not
go
to
church
this
morning
dear
she
explained
if
were
there
and
i
saw
him
looking
holy
and
pleased
as
he
always
looks
when
he
thinks
the
huns
are
winning
i
fear
i
would
lose
my
patience
and
my
sense
of
decorum
and
hurl
a
bible
or
at
him
thereby
disgracing
myself
and
the
sacred
edifice
no
dear
i
shall
stay
home
from
church
till
the
tide
turns
and
pray
hard
here
i
think
i
might
as
well
stay
home
too
for
all
the
good
church
will
do
me
today
miss
oliver
said
to
rilla
as
they
walked
down
the
red
road
to
the
church
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
the
question
the
line
still
hold
next
sunday
will
be
easter
said
rilla
will
it
herald
death
or
life
to
our
cause
meredith
preached
that
morning
from
the
text
he
that
endureth
to
the
end
shall
be
saved
and
hope
and
confidence
rang
through
his
inspiring
sentences
rilla
looking
up
at
the
memorial
tablet
on
the
wall
above
their
pew
sacred
to
the
memory
of
walter
cuthbert
blythe
felt
herself
lifted
out
of
her
dread
and
filled
anew
with
courage
walter
could
not
have
laid
down
his
life
for
naught
his
had
been
the
gift
of
prophetic
vision
and
he
had
foreseen
victory
she
would
cling
to
that
belief
the
line
would
hold
in
this
renewed
mood
she
walked
home
from
church
almost
gaily
the
others
too
were
hopeful
and
all
went
smiling
into
ingleside
there
was
no
one
in
the
save
jims
who
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
and
doc
who
sat
hushed
in
grim
repose
on
the
looking
very
hydeish
indeed
no
one
was
in
the
either
and
stranger
still
no
dinner
was
on
the
table
which
was
not
even
set
where
was
susan
can
she
have
taken
ill
exclaimed
blythe
anxiously
i
thought
it
strange
that
she
did
not
want
to
go
to
church
this
morning
the
kitchen
door
opened
and
susan
appeared
on
the
threshold
with
such
a
ghastly
face
that
blythe
cried
out
in
sudden
panic
susan
what
is
it
the
british
line
is
broken
and
the
german
shells
are
falling
on
paris
said
susan
dully
the
three
women
stared
at
each
other
stricken
it
not
true
it
not
gasped
rilla
the
thing
would
be
ridiculous
said
gertrude
oliver
and
then
she
laughed
horribly
susan
who
told
you
this
when
did
the
news
come
asked
blythe
i
got
it
over
the
phone
from
charlottetown
half
an
hour
ago
said
susan
the
news
came
to
town
late
last
night
it
was
holland
phoned
it
out
and
he
said
it
was
only
too
true
since
then
i
have
done
nothing
dear
i
am
very
sorry
dinner
is
not
ready
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
so
remiss
if
you
will
be
patient
i
will
soon
have
something
for
you
to
eat
but
i
am
afraid
i
let
the
potatoes
burn
dinner
nobody
wants
any
dinner
susan
said
blythe
wildly
oh
this
thing
is
unbelievable
it
must
be
a
nightmare
paris
is
lost
france
is
lost
the
war
is
lost
gasped
rilla
amid
the
utter
ruins
of
hope
and
confidence
and
belief
oh
god
oh
god
moaned
gertrude
oliver
walking
about
the
room
and
wringing
her
hands
oh
god
nothing
else
no
other
words
nothing
but
that
age
old
plea
the
old
old
cry
of
supreme
agony
and
appeal
from
the
human
heart
whose
every
human
staff
has
failed
it
is
god
dead
asked
a
startled
little
voice
from
the
doorway
of
the
jims
stood
there
flushed
from
sleep
his
big
brown
eyes
filled
with
dread
oh
willa
oh
willa
is
god
dead
miss
oliver
stopped
walking
and
exclaiming
and
stared
at
jims
in
whose
eyes
tears
of
fright
were
beginning
to
gather
rilla
ran
to
his
comforting
while
susan
bounded
up
from
the
chair
upon
which
she
had
dropped
no
she
said
briskly
with
a
sudden
return
of
her
real
self
no
god
is
dead
nor
lloyd
george
either
we
were
forgetting
that
dear
do
cry
little
kitchener
bad
as
things
are
they
might
be
worse
the
british
line
may
be
broken
but
the
british
navy
is
not
let
us
tie
to
that
i
will
take
a
brace
and
get
up
a
bite
to
eat
for
strength
we
must
have
they
made
a
pretence
of
eating
susan
bite
but
it
was
only
a
pretence
nobody
at
ingleside
ever
forgot
that
black
afternoon
gertrude
oliver
walked
the
floor
they
all
walked
the
floor
except
susan
who
got
out
her
grey
war
sock
dear
i
must
knit
on
sunday
at
last
i
have
never
dreamed
of
doing
it
before
for
say
what
might
be
said
i
have
considered
it
was
a
violation
of
the
third
commandment
but
whether
it
is
or
whether
it
is
not
i
must
knit
today
or
i
shall
go
mad
knit
if
you
can
susan
said
blythe
restlessly
i
would
knit
if
i
could
but
i
can
not
i
can
not
if
we
could
only
get
fuller
information
moaned
rilla
there
might
be
something
to
encourage
us
if
we
knew
all
we
know
that
the
germans
are
shelling
paris
said
miss
oliver
bitterly
in
that
case
they
must
have
smashed
through
everywhere
and
be
at
the
very
gates
no
we
have
lost
let
us
face
the
fact
as
other
peoples
in
the
past
have
had
to
face
it
other
nations
with
right
on
their
side
have
given
their
best
and
bravest
and
gone
down
to
defeat
in
spite
of
it
ours
is
one
more
to
baffled
millions
who
have
gone
before
i
wo
give
up
like
that
cried
rilla
her
pale
face
suddenly
flushing
i
wo
despair
we
are
not
conquered
no
if
germany
overruns
all
france
we
are
not
conquered
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
for
this
hour
of
despair
you
wo
see
me
slump
again
like
that
i
going
to
ring
up
town
at
once
and
ask
for
particulars
but
town
could
not
be
got
the
operator
there
was
submerged
by
similar
calls
from
every
part
of
the
distracted
country
rilla
finally
gave
up
and
slipped
away
to
rainbow
valley
there
she
knelt
down
on
the
withered
grey
grasses
in
the
little
nook
where
she
and
walter
had
had
their
last
talk
together
with
her
head
bowed
against
the
mossy
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
the
sun
had
broken
through
the
black
clouds
and
drenched
the
valley
with
a
pale
golden
splendour
the
bells
on
the
tree
lovers
twinkled
elfinly
and
fitfully
in
the
gusty
march
wind
oh
god
give
me
strength
rilla
whispered
just
strength
and
courage
then
like
a
child
she
clasped
her
hands
together
and
said
as
simply
as
jims
could
have
done
please
send
us
better
news
tomorrow
she
knelt
there
a
long
time
and
when
she
went
back
to
ingleside
she
was
calm
and
resolute
the
doctor
had
arrived
home
tired
but
triumphant
little
douglas
haig
marwood
having
made
a
safe
landing
on
the
shores
of
time
gertrude
was
still
pacing
restlessly
but
blythe
and
susan
had
reacted
from
the
shock
and
susan
was
already
planning
a
new
line
of
defence
for
the
channel
ports
as
long
as
we
can
hold
them
she
declared
the
situation
is
saved
paris
has
really
no
military
significance
do
said
gertrude
sharply
as
if
susan
had
run
something
into
her
she
thought
the
old
worn
phrase
military
significance
nothing
short
of
ghastly
mockery
under
the
circumstances
and
more
terrible
to
endure
than
the
voice
of
despair
would
have
been
i
heard
up
at
marwood
of
the
line
being
broken
said
the
doctor
but
this
story
of
the
germans
shelling
paris
seems
to
be
rather
incredible
even
if
they
broke
through
they
were
fifty
miles
from
paris
at
the
nearest
point
and
how
could
they
get
their
artillery
close
enough
to
shell
it
in
so
short
a
time
depend
upon
it
girls
that
part
of
the
message
ca
be
true
i
going
to
try
to
try
a
call
to
town
myself
the
doctor
was
no
more
successful
than
rilla
had
been
but
his
point
of
view
cheered
them
all
a
little
and
helped
them
through
the
evening
and
at
nine
a
message
came
through
at
last
that
helped
them
through
the
night
the
line
broke
only
in
one
place
before
quentin
said
the
doctor
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
the
british
troops
are
retreating
in
good
order
that
not
so
bad
as
for
the
shells
that
are
falling
on
paris
they
are
coming
from
a
distance
of
seventy
miles
from
some
amazing
gun
the
germans
have
invented
and
sprung
with
the
opening
offensive
that
is
all
the
news
to
date
and
holland
says
it
is
reliable
it
would
have
been
dreadful
news
yesterday
said
gertrude
but
compared
to
what
we
heard
this
morning
it
is
almost
like
good
news
but
still
she
added
trying
to
smile
i
am
afraid
i
will
not
sleep
much
tonight
there
is
one
thing
to
be
thankful
for
at
any
rate
miss
oliver
dear
said
susan
and
that
is
that
cousin
sophia
did
not
come
in
today
i
really
could
not
have
endured
her
on
top
of
all
the
rest
chapter
xxix
wounded
and
missing
battered
but
not
broken
was
the
headline
in
monday
paper
and
susan
repeated
it
over
and
over
to
herself
as
she
went
about
her
work
the
gap
caused
by
the
quentin
disaster
had
been
patched
up
in
time
but
the
allied
line
was
being
pushed
relentlessly
back
from
the
territory
they
had
purchased
in
with
half
a
million
lives
on
wednesday
the
headline
was
british
and
french
check
germans
but
still
the
retreat
went
on
back
and
back
and
back
where
would
it
end
would
the
line
break
again
this
time
disastrously
on
saturday
the
headline
was
even
berlin
admits
offensive
checked
and
for
the
first
time
in
that
terrible
week
the
ingleside
folk
dared
to
draw
a
long
breath
well
we
have
got
one
week
over
now
for
the
next
said
susan
staunchly
i
feel
like
a
prisoner
on
the
rack
when
they
stopped
turning
it
miss
oliver
said
to
rilla
as
they
went
to
church
on
easter
morning
but
i
am
not
off
the
rack
the
torture
may
begin
again
at
any
time
i
doubted
god
last
sunday
said
rilla
but
i
do
doubt
him
today
evil
can
not
win
spirit
is
on
our
side
and
it
is
bound
to
outlast
flesh
nevertheless
her
faith
was
often
tried
in
the
dark
spring
that
followed
armageddon
was
not
as
they
had
hoped
a
matter
of
a
few
days
it
stretched
out
into
weeks
and
months
again
and
again
hindenburg
struck
his
savage
sudden
blows
with
alarming
though
futile
success
again
and
again
the
military
critics
declared
the
situation
extremely
perilous
again
and
again
cousin
sophia
agreed
with
the
military
critics
if
the
allies
go
back
three
miles
more
the
war
is
lost
she
wailed
is
the
british
navy
anchored
in
those
three
miles
demanded
susan
scornfully
it
is
the
opinion
of
a
man
who
knows
all
about
it
said
cousin
sophia
solemnly
there
is
no
such
person
retorted
susan
as
for
the
military
critics
they
do
not
know
one
blessed
thing
about
it
any
more
than
you
or
i
they
have
been
mistaken
times
out
of
number
why
do
you
always
look
on
the
dark
side
sophia
crawford
because
there
ai
any
bright
side
susan
baker
oh
is
there
not
it
is
the
twentieth
of
april
and
hindy
is
not
in
paris
yet
although
he
said
he
would
be
there
by
april
first
is
that
not
a
bright
spot
at
least
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
germans
will
be
in
paris
before
very
long
and
more
than
that
susan
baker
they
will
be
in
canada
not
in
this
part
of
it
the
huns
shall
never
set
foot
in
prince
edward
island
as
long
as
i
can
handle
a
pitchfork
declared
susan
looking
and
feeling
quite
equal
to
routing
the
entire
german
army
no
sophia
crawford
to
tell
you
the
plain
truth
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
your
gloomy
predictions
i
do
not
deny
that
some
mistakes
have
been
made
the
germans
would
never
have
got
back
passchendaele
if
the
canadians
had
been
left
there
and
it
was
bad
business
trusting
to
those
portuguese
at
the
lys
river
but
that
is
no
reason
why
you
or
anyone
should
go
about
proclaiming
the
war
is
lost
i
do
not
want
to
quarrel
with
you
least
of
all
at
such
a
time
as
this
but
our
morale
must
be
kept
up
and
i
am
going
to
speak
my
mind
out
plainly
and
tell
you
that
if
you
can
not
keep
from
such
croaking
your
room
is
better
than
your
company
cousin
sophia
marched
home
in
high
dudgeon
to
digest
her
affront
and
did
not
reappear
in
susan
kitchen
for
many
weeks
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
for
they
were
hard
weeks
when
the
germans
continued
to
strike
now
here
now
there
and
seemingly
vital
points
fell
to
them
at
every
blow
and
one
day
in
early
may
when
wind
and
sunshine
frolicked
in
rainbow
valley
and
the
maple
grove
was
and
the
harbour
all
blue
and
dimpled
and
the
news
came
about
jem
there
had
been
a
trench
raid
on
the
canadian
front
a
little
trench
raid
so
insignificant
that
it
was
never
even
mentioned
in
the
dispatches
and
when
it
was
over
lieutenant
james
blythe
was
reported
wounded
and
missing
i
think
this
is
even
worse
than
the
news
of
his
death
would
have
been
moaned
rilla
through
her
white
lips
that
night
no
no
leaves
a
little
hope
rilla
urged
gertrude
oliver
yes
torturing
agonized
hope
that
keeps
you
from
ever
becoming
quite
resigned
to
the
worst
said
rilla
oh
miss
oliver
must
we
go
for
weeks
and
months
not
knowing
whether
jem
is
alive
or
dead
perhaps
we
will
never
know
i
i
can
not
bear
it
i
can
not
walter
and
now
jem
this
will
kill
mother
look
at
her
face
miss
oliver
and
you
will
see
that
and
faith
poor
faith
how
can
she
bear
it
gertrude
shivered
with
pain
she
looked
up
at
the
pictures
hanging
over
rilla
desk
and
felt
a
sudden
hatred
of
mona
lisa
endless
smile
will
not
even
this
blot
it
off
your
face
she
thought
savagely
but
she
said
gently
no
it
wo
kill
your
mother
she
made
of
finer
mettle
than
that
besides
she
refuses
to
believe
jem
is
dead
she
will
cling
to
hope
and
we
must
all
do
that
faith
you
may
be
sure
will
do
it
i
can
not
moaned
rilla
jem
was
wounded
what
chance
would
he
have
even
if
the
germans
found
him
we
know
how
they
have
treated
wounded
prisoners
i
wish
i
could
hope
miss
oliver
it
would
help
i
suppose
but
hope
seems
dead
in
me
i
ca
hope
without
some
reason
for
it
and
there
is
no
reason
when
miss
oliver
had
gone
to
her
own
room
and
rilla
was
lying
on
her
bed
in
the
moonlight
praying
desperately
for
a
little
strength
susan
stepped
in
like
a
gaunt
shadow
and
sat
down
beside
her
rilla
dear
do
not
you
worry
little
jem
is
not
dead
oh
how
can
you
believe
that
susan
because
i
know
listen
you
to
me
when
that
word
came
this
morning
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
was
dog
monday
and
tonight
as
soon
as
i
got
the
supper
dishes
washed
and
the
bread
set
i
went
down
to
the
station
there
was
dog
monday
waiting
for
the
train
just
as
patient
as
usual
now
rilla
dear
that
trench
raid
was
four
days
ago
last
monday
and
i
said
to
the
you
tell
me
if
that
dog
howled
or
made
any
kind
of
a
fuss
last
monday
night
he
thought
it
over
a
bit
and
then
he
said
he
did
not
you
sure
i
said
more
depends
on
it
than
you
think
sure
he
said
was
up
all
night
last
monday
night
because
my
mare
was
sick
and
there
was
never
a
sound
out
of
him
i
would
have
heard
if
there
had
been
for
the
stable
door
was
open
all
the
time
and
his
kennel
is
right
across
from
it
now
rilla
dear
those
were
the
man
very
words
and
you
know
how
that
poor
little
dog
howled
all
night
after
the
battle
of
courcelette
yet
he
did
not
love
walter
as
much
as
he
loved
jem
if
he
mourned
for
walter
like
that
do
you
suppose
he
would
sleep
sound
in
his
kennel
the
night
after
jem
had
been
killed
no
rilla
dear
little
jem
is
not
dead
and
that
you
may
tie
to
if
he
were
dog
monday
would
have
known
just
as
he
knew
before
and
he
would
not
be
still
waiting
for
the
trains
it
was
absurd
and
irrational
and
impossible
but
rilla
believed
it
for
all
that
and
blythe
believed
it
and
the
doctor
though
he
smiled
faintly
in
pretended
derision
felt
an
odd
confidence
replace
his
first
despair
and
foolish
and
absurd
or
not
they
all
plucked
up
heart
and
courage
to
carry
on
just
because
a
faithful
little
dog
at
the
glen
station
was
still
watching
with
unbroken
faith
for
his
master
to
come
home
common
sense
might
scorn
incredulity
might
mutter
mere
superstition
but
in
their
hearts
the
folk
of
ingleside
stood
by
their
belief
that
dog
monday
knew
chapter
xxx
the
turning
of
the
tide
susan
was
very
sorrowful
when
she
saw
the
beautiful
old
lawn
of
ingleside
ploughed
up
that
spring
and
planted
with
potatoes
yet
she
made
no
protest
even
when
her
beloved
peony
bed
was
sacrificed
but
when
the
government
passed
the
daylight
saving
law
susan
balked
there
was
a
higher
power
than
the
union
government
to
which
susan
owed
allegiance
do
you
think
it
right
to
meddle
with
the
arrangements
of
the
almighty
she
demanded
indignantly
of
the
doctor
the
doctor
quite
unmoved
responded
that
the
law
must
be
observed
and
the
ingleside
clocks
were
moved
on
accordingly
but
the
doctor
had
no
power
over
susan
little
alarm
i
bought
that
with
my
own
money
dear
she
said
firmly
and
it
shall
go
on
god
time
and
not
borden
time
susan
got
up
and
went
to
bed
by
god
time
and
regulated
her
own
goings
and
comings
by
it
she
served
the
meals
under
protest
by
borden
time
and
she
had
to
go
to
church
by
it
which
was
the
crowning
injury
but
she
said
her
prayers
by
her
own
clock
and
fed
the
hens
by
it
so
that
there
was
always
a
furtive
triumph
in
her
eye
when
she
looked
at
the
doctor
she
had
got
the
better
of
him
by
so
much
at
least
is
very
much
delighted
with
this
daylight
saving
business
she
told
him
one
evening
of
course
he
naturally
would
be
since
i
understand
that
the
germans
invented
it
i
hear
he
came
near
losing
his
entire
lately
warren
mead
cows
broke
into
the
field
one
day
last
week
it
was
the
very
day
the
germans
captured
the
which
may
have
been
a
coincidence
or
may
not
and
were
making
fine
havoc
of
it
when
dick
clow
happened
to
see
them
from
her
attic
window
at
first
she
had
no
intention
of
letting
pryor
know
she
told
me
she
had
just
gloated
over
the
sight
of
those
cows
pasturing
on
his
wheat
she
felt
it
served
him
exactly
right
but
presently
she
reflected
that
the
was
a
matter
of
great
importance
and
that
and
serve
meant
that
those
cows
must
be
routed
out
as
much
as
it
meant
anything
so
she
went
down
and
phoned
over
to
whiskers
about
the
matter
all
the
thanks
she
got
was
that
he
said
something
queer
right
out
to
her
she
is
not
prepared
to
state
that
it
was
actually
swearing
for
you
can
not
be
sure
just
what
you
hear
over
the
phone
but
she
has
her
own
opinion
and
so
have
i
but
i
will
not
express
it
for
here
comes
meredith
and
whiskers
is
one
of
his
elders
so
we
must
be
discreet
are
you
looking
for
the
new
star
asked
meredith
joining
miss
oliver
and
rilla
who
were
standing
among
the
blossoming
potatoes
gazing
skyward
yes
we
have
found
it
see
it
is
just
above
the
tip
of
the
tallest
old
pine
it
wonderful
to
be
looking
at
something
that
happened
three
thousand
years
ago
is
it
said
rilla
that
is
when
astronomers
think
the
collision
took
place
which
produced
this
new
star
it
makes
me
feel
horribly
insignificant
she
added
under
her
breath
even
this
event
can
not
dwarf
into
what
may
be
the
proper
perspective
in
star
systems
the
fact
that
the
germans
are
again
only
one
leap
from
paris
said
gertrude
restlessly
i
think
i
would
like
to
have
been
an
astronomer
said
meredith
dreamily
gazing
at
the
star
there
must
be
a
strange
pleasure
in
it
agreed
miss
oliver
an
unearthly
pleasure
in
more
senses
than
one
i
would
like
to
have
a
few
astronomers
for
my
friends
fancy
talking
the
gossip
of
the
hosts
of
heaven
laughed
rilla
i
wonder
if
astronomers
feel
a
very
deep
interest
in
earthly
affairs
said
the
doctor
perhaps
students
of
the
canals
of
mars
would
not
be
so
keenly
sensitive
to
the
significance
of
a
few
yards
of
trenches
lost
or
won
on
the
western
front
i
have
read
somewhere
said
meredith
that
ernest
renan
wrote
one
of
his
books
during
the
siege
of
paris
in
and
the
writing
of
it
very
much
i
suppose
one
would
call
him
a
philosopher
i
have
read
also
said
miss
oliver
that
shortly
before
his
death
he
said
that
his
only
regret
in
dying
was
that
he
must
die
before
he
had
seen
what
that
interesting
young
man
the
german
emperor
would
do
in
his
life
if
ernest
renan
today
and
saw
what
that
interesting
young
man
had
done
to
his
beloved
france
not
to
speak
of
the
world
i
wonder
if
his
mental
detachment
would
be
as
complete
as
it
was
in
i
wonder
where
jem
is
tonight
thought
rilla
in
a
sudden
bitter
inrush
of
remembrance
it
was
over
a
month
since
the
news
had
come
about
jem
nothing
had
been
discovered
concerning
him
in
spite
of
all
efforts
two
or
three
letters
had
come
from
him
written
before
the
trench
raid
and
since
then
there
had
been
only
unbroken
silence
now
the
germans
were
again
at
the
marne
pressing
nearer
and
nearer
paris
now
rumours
were
coming
of
another
austrian
offensive
against
the
piave
line
rilla
turned
away
from
the
new
star
sick
at
heart
it
was
one
of
the
moments
when
hope
and
courage
failed
her
utterly
when
it
seemed
impossible
to
go
on
even
one
more
day
if
only
they
knew
what
had
happened
to
jem
you
can
face
anything
you
know
but
a
beleaguerment
of
fear
and
doubt
and
suspense
is
a
hard
thing
for
the
morale
surely
if
jem
were
alive
some
word
would
have
come
through
he
must
be
dead
only
they
would
never
know
they
could
never
be
quite
sure
and
dog
monday
would
wait
for
the
train
until
he
died
of
old
age
monday
was
only
a
poor
faithful
rheumatic
little
dog
who
knew
nothing
more
of
his
master
fate
than
they
did
rilla
had
a
white
night
and
did
not
fall
asleep
until
late
when
she
wakened
gertrude
oliver
was
sitting
at
her
window
leaning
out
to
meet
the
silver
mystery
of
the
dawn
her
clever
striking
profile
with
the
masses
of
black
hair
behind
it
came
out
clearly
against
the
pallid
gold
of
the
eastern
sky
rilla
remembered
jem
admiration
of
the
curve
of
miss
oliver
brow
and
chin
and
she
shuddered
everything
that
reminded
her
of
jem
was
beginning
to
give
intolerable
pain
death
had
inflicted
on
her
heart
a
terrible
wound
but
it
had
been
a
clean
wound
and
had
healed
slowly
as
such
wounds
do
though
the
scar
must
remain
for
ever
but
the
torture
of
jem
disappearance
was
another
thing
there
was
a
poison
in
it
that
kept
it
from
healing
the
alternations
of
hope
and
despair
the
endless
watching
each
day
for
the
letter
that
never
came
that
might
never
come
the
newspaper
tales
of
of
prisoners
the
bitter
wonder
as
to
jem
wound
all
were
increasingly
hard
to
bear
gertrude
oliver
turned
her
head
there
was
an
odd
brilliancy
in
her
eyes
rilla
i
had
another
dream
oh
no
no
cried
rilla
shrinking
miss
oliver
dreams
had
always
foretold
coming
disaster
rilla
it
was
a
good
dream
listen
i
dreamed
just
as
i
did
four
years
ago
that
i
stood
on
the
veranda
steps
and
looked
down
the
glen
and
it
was
still
covered
by
waves
that
lapped
about
my
feet
but
as
i
looked
the
waves
began
to
ebb
and
they
ebbed
as
swiftly
as
four
years
ago
they
rolled
in
ebbed
out
and
out
to
the
gulf
and
the
glen
lay
before
me
beautiful
and
green
with
a
rainbow
spanning
rainbow
valley
a
rainbow
of
such
splendid
colour
that
it
dazzled
me
and
i
woke
rilla
rilla
blythe
the
tide
has
turned
i
wish
i
could
believe
it
sighed
rilla
sooth
was
my
prophecy
of
fear
believe
it
when
it
augurs
cheer
quoted
gertrude
almost
gaily
i
tell
you
i
have
no
doubt
yet
in
spite
of
the
great
italian
victory
at
the
piave
that
came
a
few
days
later
she
had
doubt
many
a
time
in
the
hard
month
that
followed
and
when
in
the
germans
crossed
the
marne
again
despair
came
sickeningly
it
was
idle
they
all
felt
to
hope
that
the
miracle
of
the
marne
would
be
repeated
but
it
was
again
as
in
the
tide
turned
at
the
marne
the
french
and
the
american
troops
struck
their
sudden
smashing
blow
on
the
exposed
flank
of
the
enemy
and
with
the
almost
inconceivable
rapidity
of
a
dream
the
whole
aspect
of
the
war
changed
the
allies
have
won
two
tremendous
victories
said
the
doctor
on
july
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
end
i
feel
it
i
feel
it
said
blythe
thank
god
said
susan
folding
her
trembling
old
hands
then
she
added
under
her
breath
but
it
wo
bring
our
boys
back
nevertheless
she
went
out
and
ran
up
the
flag
for
the
first
time
since
the
fall
of
jerusalem
as
it
caught
the
breeze
and
swelled
gallantly
out
above
her
susan
lifted
her
hand
and
saluted
it
as
she
had
seen
shirley
do
we
all
given
something
to
keep
you
flying
she
said
four
hundred
thousand
of
our
boys
gone
overseas
fifty
thousand
of
them
killed
but
you
are
worth
it
the
wind
whipped
her
grey
hair
about
her
face
and
the
gingham
apron
that
shrouded
her
from
head
to
foot
was
cut
on
lines
of
economy
not
of
grace
yet
somehow
just
then
susan
made
an
imposing
figure
she
was
one
of
the
women
courageous
unquailing
patient
heroic
who
had
made
victory
possible
in
her
they
all
saluted
the
symbol
for
which
their
dearest
had
fought
something
of
this
was
in
the
doctor
mind
as
he
watched
her
from
the
door
susan
he
said
when
she
turned
to
come
in
from
first
to
last
of
this
business
you

matilda
pittman
rilla
and
jims
were
standing
on
the
rear
platform
of
their
car
when
the
train
stopped
at
the
little
millward
siding
the
august
evening
was
so
hot
and
close
that
the
crowded
cars
were
stifling
nobody
ever
knew
just
why
trains
stopped
at
millward
siding
nobody
was
ever
known
to
get
off
there
or
get
on
there
was
only
one
house
nearer
to
it
than
four
miles
and
it
was
surrounded
by
acres
of
blueberry
barrens
and
scrub
rilla
was
on
her
way
into
charlottetown
to
spend
the
night
with
a
friend
and
the
next
day
in
red
cross
shopping
she
had
taken
jims
with
her
partly
because
she
did
not
want
susan
or
her
mother
to
be
bothered
with
his
care
partly
because
of
a
hungry
desire
in
her
heart
to
have
as
much
of
him
as
she
could
before
she
might
have
to
give
him
up
forever
james
anderson
had
written
to
her
not
long
before
this
he
was
wounded
and
in
the
hospital
he
would
not
be
able
to
go
back
to
the
front
and
as
soon
as
he
was
able
he
would
be
coming
home
for
jims
rilla
was
over
this
and
worried
also
she
loved
jims
dearly
and
would
feel
deeply
giving
him
up
in
any
case
but
if
jim
anderson
were
a
different
sort
of
a
man
with
a
proper
home
for
the
child
it
would
not
be
so
bad
but
to
give
jims
up
to
a
roving
shiftless
irresponsible
father
however
kind
and
he
might
be
and
she
knew
jim
anderson
was
kind
and
enough
was
a
bitter
prospect
to
rilla
it
was
not
even
likely
anderson
would
stay
in
the
glen
he
had
no
ties
there
now
he
might
even
go
back
to
england
she
might
never
see
her
dear
sunshiny
carefully
little
jims
again
with
such
a
father
what
might
his
fate
be
rilla
meant
to
beg
jim
anderson
to
leave
him
with
her
but
from
his
letter
she
had
not
much
hope
that
he
would
if
he
would
only
stay
in
the
glen
where
i
could
keep
an
eye
on
jims
and
have
him
often
with
me
i
would
feel
so
worried
over
it
she
reflected
but
i
feel
sure
he
wo
and
jims
will
never
have
any
chance
and
he
is
such
a
bright
little
chap
he
has
ambition
wherever
he
got
it
and
he
is
lazy
but
his
father
will
never
have
a
cent
to
give
him
any
education
or
start
in
life
jims
my
little
whatever
is
going
to
become
of
you
jims
was
not
in
the
least
concerned
over
what
was
to
become
of
him
he
was
gleefully
watching
the
antics
of
a
striped
chipmunk
that
was
frisking
over
the
roof
of
the
little
siding
as
the
train
pulled
out
jims
leaned
eagerly
forward
for
a
last
look
at
chippy
pulling
his
hand
from
rilla
rilla
was
so
engrossed
in
wondering
what
was
to
become
of
jims
in
the
future
that
she
forgot
to
take
notice
of
what
was
happening
to
him
in
the
present
what
did
happen
was
that
jims
lost
his
balance
shot
headlong
down
the
steps
hurtled
across
the
little
siding
platform
and
landed
in
a
clump
of
bracken
fern
on
the
other
side
rilla
shrieked
and
lost
her
head
she
sprang
down
the
steps
and
jumped
off
the
train
fortunately
the
train
was
still
going
at
a
comparatively
slow
speed
fortunately
also
rilla
retained
enough
sense
to
jump
the
way
it
was
going
nevertheless
she
fell
and
sprawled
helplessly
down
the
embankment
landing
in
a
ditch
full
of
a
rank
growth
of
and
fireweed
nobody
had
seen
what
had
happened
and
the
train
whisked
briskly
away
round
a
curve
in
the
barrens
rilla
picked
herself
up
dizzy
but
unhurt
scrambled
out
of
the
ditch
and
flew
wildly
across
the
platform
expecting
to
find
jims
dead
or
broken
in
pieces
but
jims
except
for
a
few
bruises
and
a
big
fright
was
quite
uninjured
he
was
so
badly
scared
that
he
did
even
cry
but
rilla
when
she
found
that
he
was
safe
and
sound
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
wildly
nasty
old
twain
remarked
jims
in
disgust
and
nasty
old
god
he
added
with
a
scowl
at
the
heavens
a
laugh
broke
into
rilla
sobbing
producing
something
very
like
what
her
father
would
have
called
hysterics
but
she
caught
herself
up
before
the
hysteria
could
conquer
her
rilla
blythe
i
ashamed
of
you
pull
yourself
together
immediately
jims
you
should
have
said
anything
like
that
god
frew
me
off
the
twain
declared
jims
defiantly
somebody
frew
me
you
did
frow
me
so
it
was
god
no
it
was
you
fell
because
you
let
go
of
my
hand
and
bent
too
far
forward
i
told
you
not
to
do
that
so
that
it
was
your
own
fault
jims
looked
to
see
if
she
meant
it
then
glanced
up
at
the
sky
again
excuse
me
then
god
he
remarked
airily
rilla
scanned
the
sky
also
she
did
not
like
its
appearance
a
heavy
thundercloud
was
appearing
in
the
northwest
what
in
the
world
was
to
be
done
there
was
no
other
train
that
night
since
the
nine
special
ran
only
on
saturdays
would
it
be
possible
for
them
to
reach
hannah
brewster
house
two
miles
away
before
the
storm
broke
rilla
thought
she
could
do
it
alone
easily
enough
but
with
jims
it
was
another
matter
were
his
little
legs
good
for
it
we
got
to
try
it
said
rilla
desperately
we
might
stay
in
the
siding
until
the
thunderstorm
is
over
but
it
may
keep
on
raining
all
night
and
anyway
it
will
be
pitch
dark
if
we
can
get
to
hannah
she
will
keep
us
all
night
hannah
brewster
when
she
had
been
hannah
crawford
had
lived
in
the
glen
and
gone
to
school
with
rilla
they
had
been
good
friends
then
though
hannah
had
been
three
years
the
older
she
had
married
very
young
and
had
gone
to
live
in
millward
what
with
hard
work
and
babies
and
a
husband
her
life
had
not
been
an
easy
one
and
hannah
seldom
revisited
her
old
home
rilla
had
visited
her
once
soon
after
her
marriage
but
had
not
seen
her
or
even
heard
of
her
for
years
she
knew
however
that
she
and
jims
would
find
welcome
and
harbourage
in
any
house
where
generous
hannah
lived
for
the
first
mile
they
got
on
very
well
but
the
second
one
was
harder
the
road
seldom
used
was
rough
and
jims
grew
so
tired
that
rilla
had
to
carry
him
for
the
last
quarter
she
reached
the
brewster
house
almost
exhausted
and
dropped
jims
on
the
walk
with
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
the
sky
was
black
with
clouds
the
first
heavy
drops
were
beginning
to
fall
and
the
rumble
of
thunder
was
growing
very
loud
then
she
made
an
unpleasant
discovery
the
blinds
were
all
down
and
the
doors
locked
evidently
the
brewsters
were
not
at
home
rilla
ran
to
the
little
barn
it
too
was
locked
no
other
refuge
presented
itself
the
bare
whitewashed
little
house
had
not
even
a
veranda
or
porch
it
was
almost
dark
now
and
her
plight
seemed
desperate
i
going
to
get
in
if
i
have
to
break
a
window
said
rilla
resolutely
hannah
would
want
me
to
do
that
she
never
get
over
it
if
she
heard
i
came
to
her
house
for
refuge
in
a
thunderstorm
and
could
get
in
luckily
she
did
not
have
to
go
to
the
length
of
actual
housebreaking
the
kitchen
window
went
up
quite
easily
rilla
lifted
jims
in
and
scrambled
through
herself
just
as
the
storm
broke
in
good
earnest
oh
see
all
the
little
pieces
of
thunder
cried
jims
in
delight
as
the
hail
danced
in
after
them
rilla
shut
the
window
and
with
some
difficulty
found
and
lighted
a
lamp
they
were
in
a
very
snug
little
kitchen
opening
off
it
on
one
side
was
a
trim
nicely
furnished
parlour
and
on
the
other
a
pantry
which
proved
to
be
well
stocked
i
going
to
make
myself
at
home
said
rilla
i
know
that
is
just
what
hannah
would
want
me
to
do
i
get
a
little
snack
for
jims
and
me
and
then
if
the
rain
continues
and
nobody
comes
home
i
just
go
upstairs
to
the
spare
room
and
go
to
bed
there
is
nothing
like
acting
sensibly
in
an
emergency
if
i
had
not
been
a
goose
when
i
saw
jims
fall
off
the
train
i
have
rushed
back
into
the
car
and
got
some
one
to
stop
it
then
i
would
have
been
in
this
scrape
since
i
am
in
it
i
make
the
best
of
it
this
house
she
added
looking
around
is
fixed
up
much
nicer
than
when
i
was
here
before
of
course
hannah
and
ted
were
just
beginning
housekeeping
then
but
somehow
i
had
the
idea
that
ted
has
been
very
prosperous
he
must
have
done
better
than
i
been
led
to
believe
when
they
can
afford
furniture
like
this
i
awfully
glad
for
hannah
sake
the
thunderstorm
passed
but
the
rain
continued
to
fall
heavily
at
eleven
rilla
decided
that
nobody
was
coming
home
jims
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
she
carried
him
up
to
the
spare
room
and
put
him
to
bed
then
she
undressed
put
on
a
nightgown
she
found
in
the
washstand
drawer
and
scrambled
sleepily
in
between
very
nice
sheets
she
was
so
tired
after
her
adventures
and
exertions
that
not
even
the
oddity
of
her
situation
could
keep
her
awake
she
was
sound
asleep
in
a
few
minutes
rilla
slept
until
eight
the
next
morning
and
then
wakened
with
startling
suddenness
somebody
was
saying
in
a
harsh
gruff
voice
here
you
two
wake
up
i
want
to
know
what
this
means
rilla
did
wake
up
promptly
and
effectually
she
had
never
in
all
her
life
wakened
up
so
thoroughly
before
standing
in
the
room
were
three
people
one
of
them
a
man
who
were
absolute
strangers
to
her
the
man
was
a
big
fellow
with
a
bushy
black
beard
and
an
angry
scowl
beside
him
was
a
woman
a
tall
thin
angular
person
with
violently
red
hair
and
an
indescribable
hat
she
looked
even
crosser
and
more
amazed
than
the
man
if
that
were
possible
in
the
background
was
another
woman
a
tiny
old
lady
who
must
have
been
at
least
eighty
she
was
in
spite
of
her
tinyness
a
very
personage
she
was
dressed
in
unrelieved
black
had
hair
a
face
and
snapping
vivid
eyes
she
looked
as
amazed
as
the
other
two
but
rilla
realized
that
she
did
look
cross
rilla
also
was
realizing
that
something
was
wrong
fearfully
wrong
then
the
man
said
more
gruffly
than
ever
come
now
who
are
you
and
what
business
have
you
here
rilla
raised
herself
on
one
elbow
looking
and
feeling
hopelessly
bewildered
and
foolish
she
heard
the
old
lady
in
the
background
chuckle
to
herself
she
must
be
real
rilla
thought
i
ca
be
dreaming
her
aloud
she
gasped
is
this
theodore
brewster
place
no
said
the
big
woman
speaking
for
the
first
time
this
place
belongs
to
us
we
bought
it
from
the
brewsters
last
fall
they
moved
to
greenvale
our
name
is
chapley
poor
rilla
fell
back
on
her
pillow
quite
overcome
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
i
i
thought
the
brewsters
lived
here
brewster
is
a
friend
of
mine
i
am
rilla
blythe
daughter
from
glen
mary
i
i
was
going
to
town
with
my
my
this
little
boy
and
he
fell
off
the
train
and
i
jumped
off
after
him
and
nobody
knew
of
it
i
knew
we
could
get
home
last
night
and
a
storm
was
coming
up
so
we
came
here
and
when
we
found
nobody
at
home
we
we
just
got
in
through
the
window
and
and
made
ourselves
at
home
so
it
seems
said
the
woman
sarcastically
a
likely
story
said
the
man
we
were
born
yesterday
added
the
woman
madam
did
say
anything
but
when
the
other
two
made
their
pretty
speeches
she
doubled
up
in
a
silent
convulsion
of
mirth
shaking
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
beating
the
air
with
her
hands
rilla
stung
by
the
disagreeable
attitude
of
the
chapleys
regained
her
and
lost
her
temper
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
said
in
her
haughtiest
voice
i
do
not
know
when
you
were
born
or
where
but
it
must
have
been
somewhere
where
very
peculiar
manners
were
taught
if
you
will
have
the
decency
to
leave
my
room
er
this
room
until
i
can
get
up
and
dress
i
shall
not
transgress
upon
your
hospitality
rilla
was
killingly
sarcastic
any
longer
and
i
shall
pay
you
amply
for
the
food
we
have
eaten
and
the
night
lodging
i
have
taken
the
apparition
went
through
the
motion
of
clapping
her
hands
but
not
a
sound
did
she
make
perhaps
chapley
was
cowed
by
rilla
tone
or
perhaps
he
was
appeased
at
the
prospect
of
payment
at
all
events
he
spoke
more
civilly
well
that
fair
if
you
pay
up
it
all
right
she
shall
do
no
such
thing
as
pay
you
said
madam
in
a
surprisingly
clear
resolute
authoritative
tone
of
voice
if
you
have
got
any
shame
for
yourself
robert
chapley
you
got
a
who
can
be
ashamed
for
you
no
strangers
shall
be
charged
for
room
and
lodging
in
any
house
where
matilda
pitman
lives
remember
that
though
i
may
have
come
down
in
the
world
i
quite
forgot
all
decency
for
all
that
i
knew
you
was
a
skinflint
when
amelia
married
you
and
you
made
her
as
bad
as
yourself
but
matilda
pitman
has
been
boss
for
a
long
time
and
matilda
pitman
will
remain
boss
here
you
robert
chapley
take
yourself
out
of
here
and
let
that
girl
get
dressed
and
you
amelia
go
downstairs
and
cook
a
breakfast
for
her
never
in
all
her
life
had
rilla
seen
anything
like
the
abject
meekness
with
which
those
two
big
people
obeyed
that
mite
they
went
without
word
or
look
of
protest
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
matilda
pitman
laughed
silently
and
rocked
from
side
to
side
in
her
merriment
ai
it
funny
she
said
i
mostly
lets
them
run
the
length
of
their
tether
but
sometimes
i
has
to
pull
them
up
and
then
i
does
it
with
a
jerk
they
do
dast
aggravate
me
because
i
got
considerable
hard
cash
and
they
afraid
i
wo
leave
it
all
to
them
neither
i
will
i
leave
some
but
some
i
wo
just
to
vex
i
have
made
up
my
mind
where
i
will
leave
it
but
i
have
to
soon
for
at
eighty
a
body
is
living
on
borrowed
time
now
you
can
take
your
time
about
dressing
my
dear
and
i
go
down
and
keep
them
mean
scallawags
in
order
that
a
handsome
child
you
have
there
is
he
your
brother
no
he
a
little
i
been
taking
care
of
because
his
mother
died
and
his
father
was
overseas
answered
rilla
in
a
subdued
tone
humph
well
i
better
skin
out
before
he
wakes
up
or
likely
start
crying
children
do
like
me
never
did
i
recollect
any
youngster
ever
coming
near
me
of
its
own
accord
never
had
any
of
my
own
amelia
was
my
well
it
saved
me
a
world
of
bother
if
kids
do
like
me
i
do
like
them
so
that
an
even
score
but
that
certainly
is
a
handsome
child
jims
chose
this
moment
for
waking
up
he
opened
his
big
brown
eyes
and
looked
at
matilda
pitman
unblinkingly
then
he
sat
up
dimpled
deliciously
pointed
to
her
and
said
solemnly
to
rilla
pwitty
lady
willa
pwitty
lady
matilda
pitman
smiled
even
is
sometimes
vulnerable
in
vanity
i
heard
that
children
and
fools
tell
the
truth
she
said
i
was
used
to
compliments
when
i
was
young
but
they
scarcer
when
you
get
as
far
along
as
i
am
i
have
had
one
for
years
it
tastes
good
i
now
you
monkey
you
would
give
me
a
kiss
then
jims
did
a
quite
surprising
thing
he
was
not
a
demonstrative
youngster
and
was
chary
with
kisses
even
to
the
ingleside
people
but
without
a
word
he
stood
up
in
bed
his
plump
little
body
encased
only
in
his
undershirt
ran
to
the
footboard
flung
his
arms
about
matilda
pitman
neck
and
gave
her
a
bear
hug
accompanied
by
three
or
four
hearty
ungrudging
smacks
jims
protested
rilla
aghast
at
this
liberty
you
leave
him
be
ordered
matilda
pitman
setting
her
bonnet
straight
laws
i
like
to
see
some
one
that
is
skeered
of
me
everybody
is
you
are
though
you
trying
to
hide
it
and
why
of
course
robert
and
amelia
are
because
i
make
skeered
on
purpose
but
folks
always
are
no
matter
how
civil
i
be
to
them
are
you
going
to
keep
this
child
i
afraid
not
his
father
is
coming
home
before
long
is
he
any
good
the
father
i
mean
well
he
kind
and
nice
but
he
poor
and
i
afraid
he
always
will
be
faltered
rilla
i
see
shiftless
ca
make
or
keep
well
i
see
i
see
i
have
an
idea
it
a
good
idea
and
besides
it
will
make
robert
and
amelia
squirm
that
its
main
merit
in
my
eyes
though
i
like
that
child
mind
you
because
he
ai
skeered
of
me
he
worth
some
bother
now
you
get
dressed
as
i
said
before
and
come
down
when
you
good
and
ready
rilla
was
stiff
and
sore
after
her
tumble
and
walk
of
the
night
before
but
she
was
not
long
in
dressing
herself
and
jims
when
she
went
down
to
the
kitchen
she
found
a
smoking
hot
breakfast
on
the
table
chapley
was
nowhere
in
sight
and
chapley
was
cutting
bread
with
a
sulky
air
matilda
pitman
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
knitting
a
grey
army
sock
she
still
wore
her
bonnet
and
her
triumphant
expression
set
right
in
dears
and
make
a
good
breakfast
she
said
i
am
not
hungry
said
rilla
almost
pleadingly
i
do
think
i
can
eat
anything
and
it
is
time
i
was
starting
for
the
station
the
morning
train
will
soon
be
along
please
excuse
me
and
let
us
go
take
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
for
jims
matilda
pitman
shook
a
playfully
at
rilla
sit
down
and
take
your
breakfast
she
said
matilda
pitman
commands
you
everybody
obeys
matilda
pitman
even
robert
and
amelia
you
must
obey
her
too
rilla
did
obey
her
she
sat
down
and
such
was
the
influence
of
matilda
pitman
mesmeric
eye
she
ate
a
tolerable
breakfast
the
obedient
amelia
never
spoke
matilda
pitman
did
not
speak
either
but
she
knitted
furiously
and
chuckled
when
rilla
had
finished
matilda
pitman
rolled
up
her
sock
now
you
can
go
if
you
want
to
she
said
but
you
do
have
to
go
you
can
stay
here
as
long
as
you
want
to
and
i
make
amelia
cook
your
meals
for
you
the
independent
miss
blythe
whom
a
certain
clique
of
junior
red
cross
girls
accused
of
being
domineering
and
bossy
was
thoroughly
cowed
thank
you
she
said
meekly
but
we
must
really
go
well
then
said
matilda
pitman
throwing
open
the
door
your
conveyance
is
ready
for
you
i
told
robert
he
must
hitch
up
and
drive
you
to
the
station
i
enjoy
making
robert
do
things
it
almost
the
only
sport
i
have
left
i
over
eighty
and
most
things
have
lost
their
flavour
except
bossing
robert
robert
sat
before
the
door
on
the
front
seat
of
a
trim
buggy
he
must
have
heard
every
word
his
said
but
he
gave
no
sign
i
do
wish
said
rilla
plucking
up
what
little
spirit
she
had
left
that
you
would
let
me
oh
ah
then
she
quailed
again
before
matilda
pitman
eye
recompense
you
for
for
matilda
pitman
said
before
and
meant
it
that
she
does
take
pay
for
entertaining
strangers
nor
let
other
people
where
she
lives
do
it
much
as
their
natural
meanness
would
like
to
do
it
you
go
along
to
town
and
do
forget
to
call
the
next
time
you
come
this
way
do
be
scared
not
that
you
are
scared
of
much
i
reckon
considering
the
way
you
sassed
robert
back
this
morning
i
like
your
spunk
most
girls
nowadays
are
such
timid
skeery
creeturs
when
i
was
a
girl
i
afraid
of
nothing
nor
nobody
mind
you
take
good
care
of
that
boy
he
ai
any
common
child
and
make
robert
drive
round
all
the
puddles
in
the
road
i
wo
have
that
new
buggy
splashed
as
they
drove
away
jims
threw
kisses
at
matilda
pitman
as
long
as
he
could
see
her
and
matilda
pitman
waved
her
sock
back
at
him
robert
spoke
no
word
either
good
or
bad
all
the
way
to
the
station
but
he
remembered
the
puddles
when
rilla
got
out
at
the
siding
she
thanked
him
courteously
the
only
response
she
got
was
a
grunt
as
robert
turned
his
horse
and
started
for
home
well
rilla
drew
a
long
breath
i
must
try
to
get
back
into
rilla
blythe
again
i
been
somebody
else
these
past
few
hours
i
know
just
who
some
creation
of
that
extraordinary
old
person
i
believe
she
hypnotized
me
what
an
adventure
this
will
be
to
write
the
boys
and
then
she
sighed
bitter
remembrance
came
that
there
were
only
jerry
ken
carl
and
shirley
to
write
it
to
now
jem
who
would
have
appreciated
matilda
pitman
keenly
where
was
jem
chapter
xxxii
word
from
jem
august
it
is
four
years
tonight
since
the
dance
at
the
lighthouse
four
years
of
war
it
seems
like
three
times
four
i
was
fifteen
then
i
am
nineteen
now
i
expected
that
these
past
four
years
would
be
the
most
delightful
years
of
my
life
and
they
have
been
years
of
war
years
of
fear
and
grief
and
worry
but
i
humbly
hope
of
a
little
growth
in
strength
and
character
as
well
today
i
was
going
through
the
hall
and
i
heard
mother
saying
something
to
father
about
me
i
did
mean
to
listen
i
could
help
hearing
her
as
i
went
along
the
hall
and
upstairs
so
perhaps
that
is
why
i
heard
what
listeners
are
said
never
to
hear
something
good
of
myself
and
because
it
was
mother
who
said
it
i
going
to
write
it
here
in
my
journal
for
my
comforting
when
days
of
discouragement
come
upon
me
in
which
i
feel
that
i
am
vain
and
selfish
and
weak
and
that
there
is
no
good
thing
in
me
has
developed
in
a
wonderful
fashion
these
past
four
years
she
used
to
be
such
an
irresponsible
young
creature
she
has
changed
into
a
capable
womanly
girl
and
she
is
such
a
comfort
to
me
nan
and
di
have
grown
a
little
away
from
me
they
have
been
so
little
at
home
but
rilla
has
grown
closer
and
closer
to
me
we
are
chums
i
do
see
how
i
could
have
got
through
these
terrible
years
without
her
gilbert
there
that
is
just
what
mother
said
and
i
feel
glad
and
sorry
and
proud
and
humble
it
beautiful
to
have
my
mother
think
that
about
me
but
i
do
deserve
it
quite
i
not
as
good
and
strong
as
all
that
there
are
heaps
of
times
when
i
have
felt
cross
and
impatient
and
woeful
and
despairing
it
is
mother
and
susan
who
have
been
this
family
backbone
but
i
have
helped
a
little
i
believe
and
i
am
so
glad
and
thankful
the
war
news
has
been
good
right
along
the
french
and
americans
are
pushing
the
germans
back
and
back
and
back
sometimes
i
am
afraid
it
is
too
good
to
last
after
nearly
four
years
of
disasters
one
has
a
feeling
that
this
constant
success
is
unbelievable
we
do
rejoice
noisily
over
it
susan
keeps
the
flag
up
but
we
go
softly
the
price
paid
has
been
too
high
for
jubilation
we
are
just
thankful
that
it
has
not
been
paid
in
vain
no
word
has
come
from
jem
we
hope
because
we
dare
not
do
anything
else
but
there
are
hours
when
we
all
feel
though
we
never
say
so
that
such
hoping
is
foolishness
these
hours
come
more
and
more
frequently
as
the
weeks
go
by
and
we
may
never
know
that
is
the
most
terrible
thought
of
all
i
wonder
how
faith
is
bearing
it
to
judge
from
her
letters
she
has
never
for
a
moment
given
up
hope
but
she
must
have
had
her
dark
hours
of
doubt
like
the
rest
of
us
august
the
canadians
have
been
in
action
again
and
meredith
had
a
cable
today
saying
that
carl
had
been
slightly
wounded
and
is
in
the
hospital
it
did
not
say
where
the
wound
was
which
is
unusual
and
we
all
feel
worried
there
is
news
of
a
fresh
victory
every
day
now
august
the
merediths
had
a
letter
from
carl
today
his
wound
was
only
a
slight
one
but
it
was
in
his
right
eye
and
the
sight
is
gone
for
ever
eye
is
enough
to
watch
bugs
with
carl
writes
cheerfully
and
we
know
it
might
have
been
oh
so
much
worse
if
it
had
been
both
eyes
but
i
cried
all
the
afternoon
after
i
saw
carl
letter
those
beautiful
fearless
blue
eyes
of
his
there
is
one
comfort
he
will
not
have
to
go
back
to
the
front
he
is
coming
home
as
soon
as
he
is
out
of
the
hospital
the
first
of
our
boys
to
return
when
will
the
others
come
and
there
is
one
who
will
never
come
at
least
we
will
not
see
him
if
he
does
but
oh
i
think
he
will
be
there
when
our
canadian
soldiers
return
there
will
be
a
shadow
army
with
them
the
army
of
the
fallen
we
will
not
see
them
but
they
will
be
there
september
mother
and
i
went
into
charlottetown
yesterday
to
see
the
moving
picture
hearts
of
the
world
i
made
an
awful
goose
of
myself
father
will
never
stop
teasing
me
about
it
for
the
rest
of
my
life
but
it
all
seemed
so
horribly
real
and
i
was
so
intensely
interested
that
i
forgot
everything
but
the
scenes
i
saw
enacted
before
my
eyes
and
then
quite
near
the
last
came
a
terribly
exciting
one
the
heroine
was
struggling
with
a
horrible
german
soldier
who
was
trying
to
drag
her
away
i
knew
she
had
a
knife
i
had
seen
her
hide
it
to
have
it
in
readiness
and
i
could
understand
why
she
produce
it
and
finish
the
brute
i
thought
she
must
have
forgotten
it
and
just
at
the
tensest
moment
of
the
scene
i
lost
my
head
altogether
i
just
stood
right
up
on
my
feet
in
that
crowded
house
and
shrieked
at
the
top
of
my
voice
knife
is
in
your
stocking
the
knife
is
in
your
stocking
i
created
a
sensation
the
funny
part
was
that
just
as
i
said
it
the
girl
did
snatch
out
the
knife
and
stab
the
soldier
with
it
everybody
in
the
house
laughed
i
came
to
my
senses
and
fell
back
in
my
seat
overcome
with
mortification
mother
was
shaking
with
laughter
i
could
have
shaken
her
why
had
she
pulled
me
down
and
choked
me
before
i
had
made
such
an
idiot
of
myself
she
protests
that
there
was
time
fortunately
the
house
was
dark
and
i
do
believe
there
was
anybody
there
who
knew
me
and
i
thought
i
was
becoming
sensible
and
and
womanly
it
is
plain
i
have
some
distance
to
go
yet
before
i
attain
that
devoutly
desired
consummation
september
in
the
east
bulgaria
has
asked
for
peace
and
in
the
west
the
british
have
smashed
the
hindenburg
line
and
right
here
in
glen
mary
little
bruce
meredith
has
done
something
that
i
think
wonderful
wonderful
because
of
the
love
behind
it
meredith
was
here
tonight
and
told
us
about
it
and
mother
and
i
cried
and
susan
got
up
and
clattered
the
things
about
the
stove
bruce
always
loved
jem
very
devotedly
and
the
child
has
never
forgotten
him
in
all
these
years
he
has
been
as
faithful
in
his
way
as
dog
monday
was
in
his
we
have
always
told
him
that
jem
would
come
back
but
it
seems
that
he
was
in
carter
flagg
store
last
night
and
he
heard
his
uncle
norman
flatly
declaring
that
jem
blythe
would
never
come
back
and
that
the
ingleside
folk
might
as
well
give
up
hoping
he
would
bruce
went
home
and
cried
himself
to
sleep
this
morning
his
mother
saw
him
going
out
of
the
yard
with
a
very
sorrowful
and
determined
look
carrying
his
pet
kitten
she
did
think
much
more
about
it
until
later
on
he
came
in
with
the
most
tragic
little
face
and
told
her
his
little
body
shaking
with
sobs
that
he
had
drowned
stripey
did
you
do
that
meredith
exclaimed
bring
jem
back
sobbed
bruce
thought
if
i
sacrificed
stripey
god
would
send
jem
back
so
i
drownded
him
and
oh
mother
it
was
awful
hard
but
surely
god
will
send
jem
back
now
stripey
was
the
dearest
thing
i
had
i
just
told
god
i
would
give
him
stripey
if
he
would
send
jem
back
and
he
will
wo
he
mother
meredith
did
know
what
to
say
to
the
poor
child
she
just
could
not
tell
him
that
perhaps
his
sacrifice
would
bring
jem
back
that
god
did
work
that
way
she
told
him
that
he
expect
it
right
away
that
perhaps
it
would
be
quite
a
long
time
yet
before
jem
came
back
but
bruce
said
ought
to
take
a
week
mother
oh
mother
stripey
was
such
a
nice
little
cat
he
purred
so
pretty
you
think
god
ought
to
like
him
enough
to
let
us
have
jem
meredith
is
worried
about
the
effect
on
bruce
faith
in
god
and
meredith
is
worried
about
the
effect
on
bruce
himself
if
his
hope
is
fulfilled
and
i
feel
as
if
i
must
cry
every
time
i
think
of
it
it
was
so
splendid
and
sad
and
beautiful
the
dear
devoted
little
fellow
he
worshipped
that
kitten
and
if
it
all
goes
for
nothing
as
so
many
sacrifices
seem
to
go
for
nothing
he
will
be
brokenhearted
for
he
is
old
enough
to
understand
that
god
does
answer
our
prayers
just
as
we
hope
and
does
make
bargains
with
us
when
we
yield
something
we
love
up
to
him
september
i
have
been
kneeling
at
my
window
in
the
moonshine
for
a
long
time
just
thanking
god
over
and
over
again
the
joy
of
last
night
and
today
has
been
so
great
that
it
seemed
half
pain
as
if
our
hearts
were
big
enough
to
hold
it
last
night
i
was
sitting
here
in
my
room
at
eleven
writing
a
letter
to
shirley
every
one
else
was
in
bed
except
father
who
was
out
i
heard
the
telephone
ring
and
i
ran
out
to
the
hall
to
answer
it
before
it
should
waken
mother
it
was
calling
and
when
i
answered
it
said
is
the
telegraph
company
office
in
charlottetown
there
is
an
overseas
cable
for
dr
blythe
i
thought
of
shirley
my
heart
stood
still
and
then
i
heard
him
saying
from
holland
the
message
was
arrived
escaped
from
germany
quite
well
writing
james
blythe
i
did
faint
or
fall
or
scream
i
did
feel
glad
or
surprised
i
did
feel
anything
i
felt
numb
just
as
i
did
when
i
heard
walter
had
enlisted
i
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turned
round
mother
was
standing
in
her
doorway
she
wore
her
old
rose
kimono
and
her
hair
was
hanging
down
her
back
in
a
long
thick
braid
and
her
eyes
were
shining
she
looked
just
like
a
young
girl
is
word
from
jem
she
said
how
did
she
know
i
had
said
a
word
at
the
phone
except
yes
yes
she
says
she
does
know
how
she
knew
but
she
did
know
she
was
awake
and
she
heard
the
ring
and
she
knew
that
there
was
word
from
jem
alive
he
well
he
in
holland
i
said
mother
came
out
into
the
hall
and
said
must
get
your
father
on
the
and
tell
him
he
is
in
the
upper
glen
she
was
very
calm
and
quiet
not
a
bit
like
i
would
have
expected
her
to
be
but
then
i
was
either
i
went
and
woke
up
gertrude
and
susan
and
told
them
susan
said
god
firstly
and
secondly
she
said
i
not
tell
you
dog
monday
knew
and
thirdly
go
down
and
make
a
cup
of
tea
and
she
stalked
down
in
her
nightdress
to
make
it
she
did
make
it
and
made
mother
and
gertrude
drink
it
but
i
went
back
to
my
room
and
shut
my
door
and
locked
it
and
i
knelt
by
my
window
and
cried
just
as
gertrude
did
when
her
great
news
came
i
think
i
know
at
last
exactly
what
i
shall
feel
like
on
the
resurrection
morning
october
today
jem
letter
came
it
has
been
in
the
house
only
six
hours
and
it
is
almost
read
to
pieces
the
told
everybody
in
the
glen
it
had
come
and
everybody
came
up
to
hear
the
news
jem
was
badly
wounded
in
the
thigh
and
he
was
picked
up
and
taken
to
prison
so
delirious
with
fever
that
he
did
know
what
was
happening
to
him
or
where
he
was
it
was
weeks
before
he
came
to
his
senses
and
was
able
to
write
then
he
did
write
but
it
never
came
he
treated
at
all
badly
at
his
camp
only
the
food
was
poor
he
had
nothing
to
eat
but
a
little
black
bread
and
boiled
turnips
and
now
and
then
a
little
soup
with
black
peas
in
it
and
we
sat
down
every
one
of
those
days
to
three
good
square
luxurious
meals
he
wrote
us
as
often
as
he
could
but
he
was
afraid
we
were
not
getting
his
letters
because
no
reply
came
as
soon
as
he
was
strong
enough
he
tried
to
escape
but
was
caught
and
brought
back
a
month
later
he
and
a
comrade
made
another
attempt
and
succeeded
in
reaching
holland
jem
ca
come
home
right
away
he
is
quite
so
well
as
his
cable
said
for
his
wound
has
not
healed
properly
and
he
has
to
go
into
a
hospital
in
england
for
further
treatment
but
he
says
he
will
be
all
right
eventually
and
we
know
he
is
safe
and
will
be
back
home
sometime
and
oh
the
difference
it
makes
in
everything
i
had
a
letter
from
jim
anderson
today
too
he
has
married
an
english
girl
got
his
discharge
and
is
coming
right
home
to
canada
with
his
bride
i
do
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
it
will
depend
on
what
kind
of
a
woman
she
is
i
had
a
second
letter
also
of
a
somewhat
mysterious
tenor
it
is
from
a
charlottetown
lawyer
asking
me
to
go
in
to
see
him
at
my
earliest
convenience
in
regard
to
a
certain
matter
connected
with
the
estate
of
the
matilda
pitman
i
read
a
notice
of
pitman
death
from
heart
failure
in
the
enterprise
a
few
weeks
ago
i
wonder
if
this
summons
has
anything
to
do
with
jims
october
i
went
into
town
this
morning
and
had
an
interview
with
lawyer
a
little
thin
wispy
man
who
spoke
of
his
late
client
with
such
a
profound
respect
that
it
is
evident
that
he
as
was
much
under
her
thumb
as
robert
and
amelia
were
he
drew
up
a
new
will
for
her
a
short
time
before
her
death
she
was
worth
thirty
thousand
dollars
the
bulk
of
which
was
left
to
amelia
chapley
but
she
left
five
thousand
to
me
in
trust
for
jims
the
interest
is
to
be
used
as
i
see
fit
for
his
education
and
the
principal
is
to
be
paid
over
to
him
on
his
twentieth
birthday
certainly
jims
was
born
lucky
i
saved
him
from
slow
extinction
at
the
hands
of
conover
mary
vance
saved
him
from
death
by
diptheritic
croup
his
star
saved
him
when
he
fell
off
the
train
and
he
tumbled
not
only
into
a
clump
of
bracken
but
right
into
this
nice
little
legacy
evidently
as
matilda
pitman
said
and
as
i
have
always
believed
he
is
no
common
child
and
he
has
no
common
destiny
in
store
for
him
at
all
events
he
is
provided
for
and
in
such
a
fashion
that
jim
anderson
ca
squander
his
inheritance
if
he
wanted
to
now
if
the
new
english
stepmother
is
only
a
good
sort
i
shall
feel
quite
easy
about
the
future
of
my
i
wonder
what
robert
and
amelia
think
of
it
i
fancy
they
will
nail
down
their
windows
when
they
leave
home
after
this
chapter
xxxiii
victory
a
day
chilling
winds
and
gloomy
skies
rilla
quoted
one
sunday
afternoon
the
sixth
of
october
to
be
exact
it
was
so
cold
that
they
had
lighted
a
fire
in
the
and
the
merry
little
flames
were
doing
their
best
to
counteract
the
outside
dourness
it
more
like
november
than
october
november
is
such
an
ugly
month
cousin
sophia
was
there
having
again
forgiven
susan
and
martin
clow
who
was
not
visiting
on
sunday
but
had
dropped
in
to
borrow
susan
cure
for
rheumatism
that
being
cheaper
than
getting
one
from
the
doctor
i
afeared
we
going
to
have
an
airly
winter
foreboded
cousin
sophia
the
muskrats
are
building
awful
big
houses
round
the
pond
and
that
a
sign
that
never
fails
dear
me
how
that
child
has
grown
cousin
sophia
sighed
again
as
if
it
were
an
unhappy
circumstance
that
a
child
should
grow
when
do
you
expect
his
father
next
week
said
rilla
well
i
hope
the
stepmother
wo
abuse
the
pore
child
sighed
cousin
sophia
but
i
have
my
doubts
i
have
my
doubts
anyhow
he
be
sure
to
feel
the
difference
between
his
usage
here
and
what
he
get
anywhere
else
you
spoiled
him
so
rilla
waiting
on
him
hand
and
foot
the
way
you
always
done
rilla
smiled
and
pressed
her
cheek
to
jims
curls
she
knew
sunny
little
jims
was
not
spoiled
nevertheless
her
heart
was
anxious
behind
her
smile
she
too
thought
much
about
the
new
anderson
and
wondered
uneasily
what
she
would
be
like
i
ca
give
jims
up
to
a
woman
who
wo
love
him
she
thought
rebelliously
i
it
going
to
rain
said
cousin
sophia
we
have
had
an
awful
lot
of
rain
this
fall
already
it
going
to
make
it
awful
hard
for
people
to
get
their
roots
in
it
was
so
in
my
young
days
we
had
beautiful
octobers
then
but
the
seasons
is
altogether
different
now
from
what
they
used
to
be
clear
across
cousin
doleful
voice
cut
the
telephone
bell
gertrude
oliver
answered
it
yes
what
what
is
it
true
is
it
official
thank
you
thank
you
gertrude
turned
and
faced
the
room
dramatically
her
dark
eyes
flashing
her
dark
face
flushed
with
feeling
all
at
once
the
sun
broke
through
the
thick
clouds
and
poured
through
the
big
crimson
maple
outside
the
window
its
reflected
glow
enveloped
her
in
a
weird
immaterial
flame
she
looked
like
a
priestess
performing
some
mystic
splendid
rite
germany
and
austria
are
suing
for
peace
she
said
rilla
went
crazy
for
a
few
minutes
she
sprang
up
and
danced
around
the
room
clapping
her
hands
laughing
crying
sit
down
child
said
clow
who
never
got
excited
over
anything
and
so
had
missed
a
tremendous
amount
of
trouble
and
delight
in
her
journey
through
life
oh
cried
rilla
i
have
walked
the
floor
for
hours
in
despair
and
anxiety
in
these
past
four
years
now
let
me
walk
in
joy
it
was
worth
living
long
dreary
years
for
this
minute
and
it
would
be
worth
living
them
again
just
to
look
back
to
it
susan
let
run
up
the
flag
and
we
must
phone
the
news
to
every
one
in
the
glen
can
we
have
as
much
sugar
as
we
want
to
now
asked
jims
eagerly
it
was
a
afternoon
as
the
news
spread
excited
people
ran
about
the
village
and
dashed
up
to
ingleside
the
merediths
came
over
and
stayed
to
supper
and
everybody
talked
and
nobody
listened
cousin
sophia
tried
to
protest
that
germany
and
austria
were
not
to
be
trusted
and
it
was
all
part
of
a
plot
but
nobody
paid
the
least
attention
to
her
this
sunday
makes
up
for
that
one
in
march
said
susan
i
wonder
said
gertrude
dreamily
apart
to
rilla
if
things
seem
rather
flat
and
insipid
when
peace
really
comes
after
being
fed
for
four
years
on
horrors
and
fears
terrible
reverses
amazing
victories
wo
anything
less
be
tame
and
uninteresting
how
strange
and
blessed
and
dull
it
will
be
not
to
dread
the
coming
of
the
mail
every
day
we
must
dread
it
for
a
little
while
yet
i
suppose
said
rilla
peace
wo
come
ca
come
for
some
weeks
yet
and
in
those
weeks
dreadful
things
may
happen
my
excitement
is
over
we
have
won
the
victory
but
oh
what
a
price
we
have
paid
not
too
high
a
price
for
freedom
said
gertrude
softly
do
you
think
it
was
rilla
no
said
rilla
under
her
breath
she
was
seeing
a
little
white
cross
on
a
battlefield
of
france
no
not
if
those
of
us
who
live
will
show
ourselves
worthy
of
it
if
we
faith
we
will
keep
faith
said
gertrude
she
rose
suddenly
a
silence
fell
around
the
table
and
in
the
silence
gertrude
repeated
walter
famous
poem
the
piper
when
she
finished
meredith
stood
up
and
held
up
his
glass
let
us
drink
he
said
to
the
silent
army
to
the
boys
who
followed
when
the
piper
summoned
our
tomorrow
they
gave
their
today
theirs
is
the
victory

hyde
goes
to
his
own
place
and
susan
takes
a
honeymoon
early
in
november
jims
left
ingleside
rilla
saw
him
go
with
many
tears
but
a
heart
free
from
boding
jim
anderson
number
two
was
such
a
nice
little
woman
that
one
was
rather
inclined
to
wonder
at
the
luck
which
bestowed
her
on
jim
she
was
and
and
wholesome
with
the
roundness
and
trigness
of
a
geranium
leaf
rilla
saw
at
first
glance
that
she
was
to
be
trusted
with
jims
i
fond
of
children
miss
she
said
heartily
i
used
to
them
i
left
six
little
brothers
and
sisters
behind
me
jims
is
a
dear
child
and
i
must
say
you
done
wonders
in
bringing
him
up
so
healthy
and
handsome
i
be
as
good
to
him
as
if
he
was
my
own
miss
and
i
make
jim
toe
the
line
all
right
he
a
good
worker
all
he
needs
is
some
one
to
keep
him
at
it
and
to
take
charge
of
his
money
we
rented
a
little
farm
just
out
of
the
village
and
we
going
to
settle
down
there
jim
wanted
to
stay
in
england
but
i
says
i
hankered
to
try
a
new
country
and
i
always
thought
canada
would
suit
me
i
so
glad
you
are
going
to
live
near
us
you
let
jims
come
here
often
wo
you
i
love
him
dearly
no
doubt
you
do
miss
for
a
lovabler
child
i
never
did
see
we
understand
jim
and
me
what
you
done
for
him
and
you
wo
find
us
ungrateful
he
can
come
here
whenever
you
want
him
and
i
always
be
glad
of
any
advice
from
you
about
his
bringing
up
he
is
more
your
baby
than
anyone
else
i
should
say
and
i
see
that
you
get
your
fair
share
of
him
miss
so
jims
went
away
with
the
soup
tureen
though
not
in
it
then
the
news
of
the
armistice
came
and
even
glen
mary
went
mad
that
night
the
village
had
a
bonfire
and
burned
the
kaiser
in
effigy
the
fishing
village
boys
turned
out
and
burned
all
the
sandhills
off
in
one
grand
glorious
conflagration
that
extended
for
seven
miles
up
at
ingleside
rilla
ran
laughing
to
her
room
now
i
going
to
do
a
most
unladylike
and
inexcusable
thing
she
said
as
she
pulled
her
green
velvet
hat
out
of
its
box
i
going
to
kick
this
hat
about
the
room
until
it
is
without
form
and
void
and
i
shall
never
as
long
as
i
live
wear
anything
of
that
shade
of
green
again
you
certainly
kept
your
vow
pluckily
laughed
miss
oliver
it
was
pluck
it
was
sheer
obstinacy
i
rather
ashamed
of
it
said
rilla
kicking
joyously
i
wanted
to
show
mother
it
mean
to
want
to
show
your
own
mother
most
unfilial
conduct
but
i
have
shown
her
and
i
shown
myself
a
few
things
oh
miss
oliver
just
for
one
moment
i
really
feeling
quite
young
again
young
and
frivolous
and
silly
did
i
ever
say
november
was
an
ugly
month
why
it
the
most
beautiful
month
in
the
whole
year
listen
to
the
bells
ringing
in
rainbow
valley
i
never
heard
them
so
clearly
they
ringing
for
peace
and
new
happiness
and
all
the
dear
sweet
sane
homey
things
that
we
can
have
again
now
miss
oliver
not
that
i
am
sane
just
now
i
do
pretend
to
be
the
whole
world
is
having
a
little
crazy
spell
today
soon
we
sober
down
and
faith
and
begin
to
build
up
our
new
world
but
just
for
today
let
be
mad
and
glad
susan
came
in
from
the
outdoor
sunlight
looking
supremely
satisfied
hyde
is
gone
she
announced
gone
do
you
mean
he
is
dead
susan
no
dear
that
beast
is
not
dead
but
you
will
never
see
him
again
i
feel
sure
of
that
do
be
so
mysterious
susan
what
has
happened
to
him
well
dear
he
was
sitting
out
on
the
back
steps
this
afternoon
it
was
just
after
the
news
came
that
the
armistice
had
been
signed
and
he
was
looking
his
hydest
i
can
assure
you
he
was
an
awesome
looking
beast
all
at
once
dear
bruce
meredith
came
around
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
walking
on
his
stilts
he
has
been
learning
to
walk
on
them
lately
and
came
over
to
show
me
how
well
he
could
do
it
hyde
just
took
a
look
and
one
bound
carried
him
over
the
yard
fence
then
he
went
tearing
through
the
maple
grove
in
great
leaps
with
his
ears
laid
back
you
never
saw
a
creature
so
terrified
dear
he
has
never
returned
oh
he
come
back
susan
probably
chastened
in
spirit
by
his
fright
we
will
see
dear
we
will
see
remember
the
armistice
has
been
signed
and
that
reminds
me
that
had
a
paralytic
stroke
last
night
i
am
not
saying
it
is
a
judgment
on
him
because
i
am
not
in
the
counsels
of
the
almighty
but
one
can
have
one
own
thoughts
about
it
neither
or
hyde
will
be
much
more
heard
of
in
glen
mary
dear
and
that
you
may
tie
to
hyde
certainly
was
heard
of
no
more
as
it
could
hardly
have
been
his
fright
that
kept
him
away
the
ingleside
folk
decided
that
some
dark
fate
of
shot
or
poison
had
descended
on
him
except
susan
who
believed
and
continued
to
affirm
that
he
had
merely
gone
to
his
own
place
rilla
lamented
him
for
she
had
been
very
fond
of
her
stately
golden
pussy
and
had
liked
him
quite
as
well
in
his
weird
hyde
moods
as
in
his
tame
jekyll
ones
and
now
dear
said
susan
since
the
fall
is
over
and
the
garden
truck
is
all
safe
in
cellar
i
am
going
to
take
a
honeymoon
to
celebrate
the
peace
a
honeymoon
susan
yes
dear
a
honeymoon
repeated
susan
firmly
i
shall
never
be
able
to
get
a
husband
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
cheated
out
of
everything
and
a
honeymoon
i
intend
to
have
i
am
going
to
charlottetown
to
visit
my
married
brother
and
his
family
his
wife
has
been
ailing
all
the
fall
but
nobody
knows
whether
she
is
going
to
die
not
she
never
did
tell
anyone
what
she
was
going
to
do
until
she
did
it
that
is
the
main
reason
why
she
was
never
liked
in
our
family
but
to
be
on
the
safe
side
i
feel
that
i
should
visit
her
i
have
not
been
in
town
for
over
a
day
for
twenty
years
and
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
might
as
well
see
one
of
those
moving
pictures
there
is
so
much
talk
of
so
as
not
to
be
wholly
out
of
the
swim
but
have
no
fear
that
i
shall
be
carried
away
with
them
dear
i
shall
be
away
a
fortnight
if
you
can
spare
me
so
long
you
certainly
deserve
a
good
holiday
susan
better
take
a
month
that
is
the
proper
length
for
a
honeymoon
no
dear
a
fortnight
is
all
i
require
besides
i
must
be
home
for
at
least
three
weeks
before
christmas
to
make
the
proper
preparations
we
will
have
a
christmas
that
is
a
christmas
this
year
dear
do
you
think
there
is
any
chance
of
our
boys
being
home
for
it
no
i
think
not
susan
both
jem
and
shirley
write
that
they
expect
to
be
home
before
spring
it
may
be
even
midsummer
before
shirley
comes
but
carl
meredith
will
be
home
and
nan
and
di
and
we
will
have
a
grand
celebration
once
more
we
set
chairs
for
all
susan
as
you
did
our
first
war
christmas
yes
for
all
for
my
dear
lad
whose
chair
must
always
be
vacant
as
well
as
for
the
others
susan
it
is
not
likely
i
would
forget
to
set
his
place
dear
said
susan
wiping
her
eyes
as
she
departed
to
pack
up
for
her
honeymoon

carl
meredith
and
miller
douglas
came
home
just
before
christmas
and
glen
mary
met
them
at
the
station
with
a
brass
band
borrowed
from
lowbridge
and
speeches
of
home
manufacture
miller
was
brisk
and
beaming
in
spite
of
his
wooden
leg
he
had
developed
into
a
imposing
looking
fellow
and
the
medal
he
wore
reconciled
miss
cornelia
to
the
shortcomings
of
his
pedigree
to
such
a
degree
that
she
tacitly
recognized
his
engagement
to
mary
the
latter
put
on
a
few
airs
especially
when
carter
flagg
took
miller
into
his
store
as
head
clerk
but
nobody
grudged
them
to
her
of
course
farming
out
of
the
question
for
us
now
she
told
rilla
but
miller
thinks
he
like
storekeeping
fine
once
he
gets
used
to
a
quiet
life
again
and
carter
flagg
will
be
a
more
agreeable
boss
than
old
kitty
we
going
to
be
married
in
the
fall
and
live
in
the
old
mead
house
with
the
bay
windows
and
the
mansard
roof
i
always
thought
that
the
handsomest
house
in
the
glen
but
never
did
i
dream
i
ever
live
there
we
only
renting
it
of
course
but
if
things
go
as
we
expect
and
carter
flagg
takes
miller
into
partnership
we
own
it
some
day
say
i
got
on
some
in
society
have
i
considering
what
i
come
from
i
never
aspired
to
being
a
storekeeper
wife
but
miller
real
ambitious
and
he
have
a
wife
that
back
him
up
he
says
he
never
saw
a
french
girl
worth
looking
at
twice
and
that
his
heart
beat
true
to
me
every
moment
he
was
away
jerry
meredith
and
joe
milgrave
came
back
in
january
and
all
winter
the
boys
from
the
glen
and
its
environs
came
home
by
twos
and
threes
none
of
them
came
back
just
as
they
went
away
not
even
those
who
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
escape
injury
one
spring
day
when
the
daffodils
were
blowing
on
the
ingleside
lawn
and
the
banks
of
the
brook
in
rainbow
valley
were
sweet
with
white
and
purple
violets
the
little
lazy
afternoon
accommodation
train
pulled
into
the
glen
station
it
was
very
seldom
that
passengers
for
the
glen
came
by
that
train
so
nobody
was
there
to
meet
it
except
the
new
station
agent
and
a
small
dog
who
for
four
and
a
half
years
had
met
every
train
that
had
steamed
into
glen
mary
thousands
of
trains
had
dog
monday
met
and
never
had
the
boy
he
waited
and
watched
for
returned
yet
still
dog
monday
watched
on
with
eyes
that
never
quite
lost
hope
perhaps
his
failed
him
at
times
he
was
growing
old
and
rheumatic
when
he
walked
back
to
his
kennel
after
each
train
had
gone
his
gait
was
very
sober
now
he
never
trotted
but
went
slowly
with
a
drooping
head
and
a
depressed
tail
that
had
quite
lost
its
old
saucy
uplift
one
passenger
stepped
off
the
train
a
tall
fellow
in
a
faded
lieutenant
uniform
who
walked
with
a
barely
perceptible
limp
he
had
a
bronzed
face
and
there
were
some
grey
hairs
in
the
ruddy
curls
that
clustered
around
his
forehead
the
new
station
agent
looked
at
him
anxiously
he
was
used
to
seeing
the
figures
come
off
the
train
some
met
by
a
tumultuous
crowd
others
who
had
sent
no
word
of
their
coming
stepping
off
quietly
like
this
one
but
there
was
a
certain
distinction
of
bearing
and
features
in
this
soldier
that
caught
his
attention
and
made
him
wonder
a
little
more
interestedly
who
he
was
a
streak
shot
past
the
station
agent
dog
monday
stiff
dog
monday
rheumatic
dog
monday
old
never
believe
it
dog
monday
was
a
young
pup
gone
clean
mad
with
rejuvenating
joy
he
flung
himself
against
the
tall
soldier
with
a
bark
that
choked
in
his
throat
from
sheer
rapture
he
flung
himself
on
the
ground
and
writhed
in
a
frenzy
of
welcome
he
tried
to
climb
the
soldier
khaki
legs
and
slipped
down
and
groveled
in
an
ecstasy
that
seemed
as
if
it
must
tear
his
little
body
in
pieces
he
licked
his
boots
and
when
the
lieutenant
had
with
laughter
on
his
lips
and
tears
in
his
eyes
succeeded
in
gathering
the
little
creature
up
in
his
arms
dog
monday
laid
his
head
on
the
khaki
shoulder
and
licked
the
sunburned
neck
making
queer
sounds
between
barks
and
sobs
the
station
agent
had
heard
the
story
of
dog
monday
he
knew
now
who
the
returned
soldier
was
dog
monday
long
vigil
was
ended
jem
blythe
had
come
home
we
are
all
very
happy
and
sad
and
thankful
wrote
rilla
in
her
diary
a
week
later
though
susan
has
not
yet
recovered
never
will
recover
i
believe
from
the
shock
of
having
jem
come
home
the
very
night
she
had
owing
to
a
strenuous
day
prepared
a
up
supper
i
shall
never
forget
the
sight
of
her
tearing
madly
about
from
pantry
to
cellar
hunting
out
stored
away
goodies
just
as
if
anybody
cared
what
was
on
the
table
none
of
us
could
eat
anyway
it
was
meat
and
drink
just
to
look
at
jem
mother
seemed
afraid
to
take
her
eyes
off
him
lest
he
vanish
out
of
her
sight
it
is
wonderful
to
have
jem
back
and
little
dog
monday
monday
refuses
to
be
separated
from
jem
for
a
moment
he
sleeps
on
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
squats
beside
him
at
and
on
sunday
he
went
to
church
with
him
and
insisted
on
going
right
into
our
pew
where
he
went
to
sleep
on
jem
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
sermon
he
woke
up
and
seemed
to
think
he
must
welcome
jem
all
over
again
for
he
bounded
up
with
a
series
of
barks
and
quiet
down
until
jem
took
him
up
in
his
arms
but
nobody
seemed
to
mind
and
meredith
came
and
patted
his
head
after
the
service
and
said
and
affection
and
loyalty
are
precious
things
wherever
they
are
found
that
little
dog
love
is
a
treasure
jem
one
night
when
jem
and
i
were
talking
things
over
in
rainbow
valley
i
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
felt
afraid
at
the
front
jem
laughed
i
was
afraid
scores
of
times
sick
with
fear
i
who
used
to
laugh
at
walter
when
he
was
frightened
do
you
know
walter
was
never
frightened
after
he
got
to
the
front
realities
never
scared
him
only
his
imagination
could
do
that
his
colonel
told
me
that
walter
was
the
bravest
man
in
the
regiment
rilla
i
never
realized
that
walter
was
dead
till
i
came
back
home
you
do
know
how
i
miss
him
now
you
folks
here
have
got
used
to
it
in
a
sense
but
it
all
fresh
to
me
walter
and
i
grew
up
together
we
were
chums
as
well
as
brothers
and
now
here
in
this
old
valley
we
loved
when
we
were
children
it
has
come
home
to
me
that
i
not
to
see
him
again
jem
is
going
back
to
college
in
the
fall
and
so
are
jerry
and
carl
i
suppose
shirley
will
too
he
expects
to
be
home
in
july
nan
and
di
will
go
on
teaching
faith
does
expect
to
be
home
before
september
i
suppose
she
will
teach
then
too
for
she
and
jem
ca
be
married
until
he
gets
through
his
course
in
medicine
una
meredith
has
decided
i
think
to
take
a
course
in
household
science
at
kingsport
and
gertrude
is
to
be
married
to
her
major
and
is
frankly
happy
about
it
happy
she
says
but
i
think
her
attitude
is
very
beautiful
they
are
all
talking
of
their
plans
and
hopes
more
soberly
than
they
used
to
do
long
ago
but
still
with
interest
and
a
determination
to
carry
on
and
make
good
in
spite
of
lost
years
in
a
new
world
jem
says
we
got
to
make
it
a
better
one
than
the
old
that
is
done
yet
though
some
folks
seem
to
think
it
ought
to
be
the
job
is
finished
it
is
really
begun
the
old
world
is
destroyed
and
we
must
build
up
the
new
one
it
will
be
the
task
of
years
i
seen
enough
of
war
to
realize
that
we
got
to
make
a
world
where
wars
ca
happen
we
given
prussianism
its
mortal
wound
but
it
is
dead
yet
and
it
is
confined
to
germany
either
it
is
enough
to
drive
out
the
old
spirit
we
got
to
bring
in
the
new
i
writing
down
those
words
of
jem
in
my
diary
so
that
i
can
read
them
over
occasionally
and
get
courage
from
them
when
moods
come
when
i
find
it
not
so
easy
to
faith
rilla
closed
her
journal
with
a
little
sigh
just
then
she
was
not
finding
it
easy
to
keep
faith
all
the
rest
seemed
to
have
some
special
aim
or
ambition
about
which
to
build
up
their
lives
she
had
none
and
she
was
very
lonely
horribly
lonely
jem
had
come
back
but
he
was
not
the
laughing
who
had
gone
away
in
and
he
belonged
to
faith
walter
would
never
come
back
she
had
not
even
jims
left
all
at
once
her
world
seemed
wide
and
empty
that
is
it
had
seemed
wide
and
empty
from
the
moment
yesterday
when
she
had
read
in
a
montreal
paper
a
list
of
returned
soldiers
in
which
was
the
name
of
captain
kenneth
ford
so
ken
was
home
and
he
had
not
even
written
her
that
he
was
coming
he
had
been
in
canada
two
weeks
and
she
had
not
had
a
line
from
him
of
course
he
had
forgotten
if
there
was
ever
anything
to
forget
a
handclasp
a
kiss
a
look
a
promise
asked
under
the
influence
of
a
passing
emotion
it
was
all
absurd
she
had
been
a
silly
romantic
inexperienced
goose
well
she
would
be
wiser
in
the
future
very
wise
and
very
discreet
and
very
contemptuous
of
men
and
their
ways
i
suppose
i
better
go
with
una
and
take
up
household
science
too
she
thought
as
she
stood
by
her
window
and
looked
down
through
a
delicate
emerald
tangle
of
young
vines
on
rainbow
valley
lying
in
a
wonderful
lilac
light
of
sunset
there
did
not
seem
anything
very
attractive
just
then
about
household
science
but
with
a
whole
new
world
waiting
to
be
built
a
girl
must
do
something
the
door
bell
rang
rilla
turned
reluctantly
stairwards
she
must
answer
it
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
house
but
she
hated
the
idea
of
callers
just
then
she
went
downstairs
slowly
and
opened
the
front
door
a
man
in
khaki
was
standing
on
the
steps
a
tall
fellow
with
dark
eyes
and
hair
and
a
narrow
white
scar
running
across
his
brown
cheek
rilla
stared
at
him
foolishly
for
a
moment
who
was
it
she
ought
to
know
him
there
was
certainly
something
very
familiar
about
him
he
said
ken
gasped
rilla
of
course
it
was
ken
but
he
looked
so
much
older
he
was
so
much
changed
that
scar
the
lines
about
his
eyes
and
lips
her
thoughts
went
whirling
helplessly
ken
took
the
uncertain
hand
she
held
out
and
looked
at
her
the
slim
rilla
of
four
years
ago
had
rounded
out
into
symmetry
he
had
left
a
school
girl
and
he
found
a
woman
a
woman
with
wonderful
eyes
and
a
dented
lip
and
cheek
a
woman
altogether
beautiful
and
desirable
the
woman
of
his
dreams
is
it
he
asked
meaningly
emotion
shook
rilla
from
head
to
foot
joy
happiness
sorrow
fear
every
passion
that
had
wrung
her
heart
in
those
four
long
years
seemed
to
surge
up
in
her
soul
for
a
moment
as
the
deeps
of
being
were
stirred
she
had
tried
to
speak
at
first
voice
would
not
come
then
yeth
said
rilla
