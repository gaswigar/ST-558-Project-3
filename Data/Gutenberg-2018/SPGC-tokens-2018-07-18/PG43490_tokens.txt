in
order
to
understand
the
social
and
dynamic
significance
of
modern
dramatic
art
it
is
necessary
i
believe
to
ascertain
the
difference
between
the
functions
of
art
for
art
sake
and
art
as
the
mirror
of
life
art
for
art
sake
presupposes
an
attitude
of
aloofness
on
the
part
of
the
artist
toward
the
complex
struggle
of
life
he
must
rise
above
the
ebb
and
tide
of
life
he
is
to
be
merely
an
artistic
conjurer
of
beautiful
forms
a
creator
of
pure
fancy
that
is
not
the
attitude
of
modern
art
which
is
preÃ«minently
the
reflex
the
mirror
of
life
the
artist
being
a
part
of
life
can
not
detach
himself
from
the
events
and
occurrences
that
pass
before
his
eyes
impressing
themselves
upon
his
emotional
and
intellectual
vision
the
modern
artist
is
in
the
words
of
august
strindberg
a
lay
preacher
popularizing
the
pressing
questions
of
his
time
not
necessarily
because
his
aim
is
to
proselyte
but
because
he
can
best
express
himself
by
being
true
to
life
millet
meunier
turgenev
dostoyevsky
emerson
walt
whitman
tolstoy
ibsen
strindberg
hauptmann
and
a
host
of
others
mirror
in
their
work
as
much
of
the
spiritual
and
social
revolt
as
is
expressed
by
the
most
fiery
speech
of
the
propagandist
and
more
important
still
they
compel
far
greater
attention
their
creative
genius
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
sincerity
and
truth
strikes
root
where
the
ordinary
word
often
falls
on
barren
soil
the
reason
that
many
radicals
as
well
as
conservatives
fail
to
grasp
the
powerful
message
of
art
is
perhaps
not
far
to
seek
the
average
radical
is
as
hidebound
by
mere
terms
as
the
man
devoid
of
all
ideas
bloated
plutocrats
economic
determinism
class
consciousness
and
similar
expressions
sum
up
for
him
the
symbols
of
revolt
but
since
art
speaks
a
language
of
its
own
a
language
embracing
the
entire
gamut
of
human
emotions
it
often
sounds
meaningless
to
those
whose
hearing
has
been
dulled
by
the
din
of
stereotyped
phrases
on
the
other
hand
the
conservative
sees
danger
only
in
the
advocacy
of
the
red
flag
he
has
too
long
been
fed
on
the
historic
legend
that
it
is
only
the
rabble
which
makes
revolutions
and
not
those
who
wield
the
brush
or
pen
it
is
therefore
legitimate
to
applaud
the
artist
and
hound
the
rabble
both
radical
and
conservative
have
to
learn
that
any
mode
of
creative
work
which
with
true
perception
portrays
social
wrongs
earnestly
and
boldly
may
be
a
greater
menace
to
our
social
fabric
and
a
more
powerful
inspiration
than
the
wildest
harangue
of
the
soapbox
orator
unfortunately
we
in
america
have
so
far
looked
upon
the
theater
as
a
place
of
amusement
only
exclusive
of
ideas
and
inspiration
because
the
modern
drama
of
europe
has
till
recently
been
inaccessible
in
printed
form
to
the
average
theatergoer
in
this
country
he
had
to
content
himself
with
the
interpretation
or
rather
misinterpretation
of
our
dramatic
critics
as
a
result
the
social
significance
of
the
modern
drama
has
well
nigh
been
lost
to
the
general
public
as
to
the
native
drama
america
has
so
far
produced
very
little
worthy
to
be
considered
in
a
social
light
lacking
the
cultural
and
evolutionary
tradition
of
the
old
world
america
has
necessarily
first
to
prepare
the
soil
out
of
which
sprouts
creative
genius
the
hundred
and
one
springs
of
local
and
sectional
life
must
have
time
to
furrow
their
common
channel
into
the
seething
sea
of
life
at
large
and
social
questions
and
problems
make
themselves
felt
if
not
crystallized
before
the
throbbing
pulse
of
the
big
national
heart
can
find
its
reflex
in
a
great
literature
and
specifically
in
the
drama
of
a
social
character
this
evolution
has
been
going
on
in
this
country
for
a
considerable
time
shaping
the
widespread
unrest
that
is
now
beginning
to
assume
more
or
less
definite
social
form
and
expression
therefore
america
could
not
so
far
produce
its
own
social
drama
but
in
proportion
as
the
crystallization
progresses
and
sectional
and
national
questions
become
clarified
as
fundamentally
social
problems
the
drama
develops
indeed
very
commendable
beginnings
in
this
direction
have
been
made
within
recent
years
among
them
the
easiest
way
by
eugene
walter
keeping
up
appearances
and
other
plays
by
butler
davenport
nowadays
and
two
others
volumes
of
plays
by
george
middleton
attempts
that
hold
out
an
encouraging
promise
for
the
future
the
modern
drama
as
all
modern
literature
mirrors
the
complex
struggle
of
life
the
struggle
which
whatever
its
individual
or
topical
expression
ever
has
its
roots
in
the
depth
of
human
nature
and
social
environment
and
hence
is
to
that
extent
universal
such
literature
such
drama
is
at
once
the
reflex
and
the
inspiration
of
mankind
in
its
eternal
seeking
for
things
higher
and
better
perhaps
those
who
learn
the
great
truths
of
the
social
travail
in
the
school
of
life
do
not
need
the
message
of
the
drama
but
there
is
another
class
whose
number
is
legion
for
whom
that
message
is
indispensable
in
countries
where
political
oppression
affects
all
classes
the
best
intellectual
element
have
made
common
cause
with
the
people
have
become
their
teachers
comrades
and
spokesmen
but
in
america
political
pressure
has
so
far
affected
only
the
common
people
it
is
they
who
are
thrown
into
prison
they
who
are
persecuted
and
mobbed
tarred
and
deported
therefore
another
medium
is
needed
to
arouse
the
intellectuals
of
this
country
to
make
them
realize
their
relation
to
the
people
to
the
social
unrest
permeating
the
atmosphere
the
medium
which
has
the
power
to
do
that
is
the
modern
drama
because
it
mirrors
every
phase
of
life
and
embraces
every
strata
of
society
the
modern
drama
showing
each
and
all
caught
in
the
throes
of
the
tremendous
changes
going
on
and
forced
either
to
become
part
of
the
process
or
be
left
behind
ibsen
strindberg
hauptmann
tolstoy
shaw
galsworthy
and
the
other
dramatists
contained
in
this
volume
represent
the
social
iconoclasts
of
our
time
they
know
that
society
has
gone
beyond
the
stage
of
patching
up
and
that
man
must
throw
off
the
dead
weight
of
the
past
with
all
its
ghosts
and
spooks
if
he
is
to
go
foot
free
to
meet
the
future
this
is
the
social
significance
which
differentiates
modern
dramatic
art
from
art
for
art
sake
it
is
the
dynamite
which
undermines
superstition
shakes
the
social
pillars
and
prepares
men
and
women
for
the
reconstruction

henrik
ibsen
in
a
letter
to
george
brandes
shortly
after
the
paris
commune
henrik
ibsen
wrote
concerning
the
state
and
political
liberty
the
state
is
the
curse
of
the
individual
how
has
the
national
strength
of
prussia
been
purchased
by
the
sinking
of
the
individual
in
a
political
and
geographical
formula
the
state
must
go
that
will
be
a
revolution
which
will
find
me
on
its
side
undermine
the
idea
of
the
state
set
up
in
its
place
spontaneous
action
and
the
idea
that
spiritual
relationship
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
for
unity
and
you
will
start
the
elements
of
a
liberty
which
will
be
something
worth
possessing
the
state
was
not
the
only
of
henrik
ibsen
every
other
institution
which
like
the
state
rests
upon
a
lie
was
an
iniquity
to
him
uncompromising
demolisher
of
all
false
idols
and
dynamiter
of
all
social
shams
and
hypocrisy
ibsen
consistently
strove
to
uproot
every
stone
of
our
social
structure
above
all
did
he
thunder
his
fiery
indictment
against
the
four
cardinal
sins
of
modern
society
the
lie
inherent
in
our
social
arrangements
sacrifice
and
duty
the
twin
curses
that
fetter
the
spirit
of
man
the
and
pettiness
of
provincialism
that
stifles
all
growth
and
the
lack
of
joy
and
purpose
in
work
which
turns
life
into
a
vale
of
misery
and
tears
so
strongly
did
ibsen
feel
on
these
matters
that
in
none
of
his
works
did
he
lose
sight
of
them
indeed
they
recur
again
and
again
like
a
in
music
in
everything
he
wrote
these
issues
form
the
keynote
to
the
revolutionary
significance
of
his
dramatic
works
as
well
as
to
the
psychology
of
henrik
ibsen
himself
it
is
therefore
not
a
little
surprising
that
most
of
the
interpreters
and
admirers
of
ibsen
so
enthusiastically
accept
his
art
and
yet
remain
utterly
indifferent
to
not
to
say
ignorant
of
the
message
contained
in
it
that
is
mainly
because
they
are
in
the
words
of
alving
so
pitifully
afraid
of
the
light
hence
they
go
about
seeking
mysteries
and
hunting
symbols
and
completely
losing
sight
of
the
meaning
that
is
as
clear
as
daylight
in
all
of
the
works
of
ibsen
and
mainly
in
the
group
of
his
social
plays
the
pillars
of
society
a
doll
house
ghosts
and
an
enemy
of
the
people
the
pillars
of
society
the
disintegrating
effect
of
the
social
lie
of
duty
as
an
imposition
and
outrage
and
of
the
spirit
of
provincialism
as
a
stifling
factor
are
brought
out
with
dynamic
force
in
the
pillars
of
society
driven
by
the
conception
of
his
duty
toward
the
house
of
bernick
begins
his
career
with
a
terrible
lie
he
sells
his
love
for
in
return
for
the
large
dowry
of
her
whom
he
does
not
love
to
forget
his
treachery
he
enters
into
a
clandestine
relationship
with
an
actress
of
the
town
when
surprised
in
her
room
by
the
drunken
husband
young
jumps
out
of
the
window
and
then
graciously
accepts
the
offer
of
his
bosom
friend
to
let
him
take
the
blame
together
with
his
faithful
sister
leaves
for
america
in
return
for
his
devotion
young
helps
to
rob
his
friend
of
his
good
name
by
acquiescing
in
the
rumors
circulating
in
the
town
that
had
broken
into
the
safe
of
the
and
stolen
a
large
sum
of
money
in
the
opening
scene
of
the
pillars
of
society
we
find
at
the
height
of
his
career
the
richest
most
powerful
and
respected
citizen
of
the
community
he
is
held
up
as
the
model
of
an
ideal
husband
and
devoted
father
in
short
a
worthy
pillar
of
society
the
best
ladies
of
the
town
come
together
in
the
home
of
the
bernicks
they
represent
the
society
for
the
lapsed
and
lost
and
they
gather
to
do
a
little
charitable
sewing
and
a
lot
of
charitable
gossip
it
is
through
them
we
learn
that
the
ward
of
is
the
issue
of
the
supposed
escapade
of
and
the
actress
with
them
giving
unctuous
spiritual
advice
and
representing
the
purity
and
morality
of
the
community
is
hidebound
and
into
this
deadening
atmosphere
of
mental
and
social
provincialism
comes
refreshing
and
invigorating
as
the
wind
of
the
plains
she
has
returned
to
her
native
town
together
with
the
moment
she
enters
the
house
of
the
whole
structure
begins
to
totter
for
in
own
words
fie
fie
this
moral
linen
here
smells
so
tainted
just
like
a
shroud
i
am
accustomed
to
the
air
of
the
prairies
now
i
can
tell
you
wait
a
little
wait
a
little
soon
rise
from
the
sepulcher
we
must
have
broad
daylight
here
when
my
boy
comes
broad
daylight
is
indeed
needed
in
the
community
of
and
above
all
in
the
life
of
the
himself
it
seems
to
be
the
psychology
of
a
lie
that
it
can
never
stand
alone
is
compelled
to
weave
a
network
of
lies
to
sustain
his
foundation
in
the
disguise
of
a
good
husband
he
upbraids
nags
and
tortures
his
wife
on
the
slightest
provocation
in
the
mask
of
a
devoted
father
he
tyrannizes
and
bullies
his
only
child
as
only
a
despot
used
to
being
obeyed
can
do
under
the
cloak
of
a
benevolent
citizen
he
buys
up
public
land
for
his
own
profit
posing
as
a
true
christian
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
jeopardize
human
life
because
of
business
considerations
he
sends
indian
an
unseaworthy
rotten
vessel
on
a
voyage
although
he
is
assured
by
one
of
his
most
capable
and
faithful
workers
that
the
ship
can
not
make
the
journey
that
it
is
sure
to
go
down
but
is
a
pillar
of
society
he
needs
the
respect
and
good
will
of
his
fellow
citizens
he
must
go
from
precipice
to
precipice
to
keep
up
appearances
alone
sees
the
abyss
facing
him
and
tells
him
what
does
it
matter
whether
such
a
society
is
supported
or
not
what
is
it
that
passes
current
here
lies
and
shams
nothing
else
here
are
you
the
first
man
in
the
town
living
in
wealth
and
pride
in
power
and
honor
you
who
have
set
the
brand
of
crime
upon
an
innocent
man
she
might
have
added
innocent
men
for
was
not
the
only
one
at
whose
expense
built
up
his
career
the
end
is
inevitable
in
the
words
of
all
this
eminence
and
you
yourself
along
with
it
stand
on
a
trembling
quicksand
a
moment
may
come
a
word
may
be
spoken
and
if
you
do
not
save
yourself
in
time
you
and
your
whole
grandeur
go
to
the
bottom
but
for
or
rather
what
she
symbolizes
even
as
indian
would
go
to
the
bottom
in
the
last
act
the
whole
town
is
preparing
to
give
the
great
philanthropist
and
benefactor
the
eminent
pillar
of
society
an
ovation
there
are
fireworks
music
gifts
and
speeches
in
honor
of
at
that
very
moment
the
only
child
of
the
is
hiding
in
indian
to
escape
the
tyranny
of
his
home
too
is
supposed
to
sail
on
the
same
ship
and
with
him
who
has
learned
the
whole
truth
and
is
eager
to
escape
from
her
prison
to
go
to
a
free
atmosphere
to
become
independent
and
then
to
unite
with
in
love
and
freedom
as
says
yes
i
will
be
your
wife
but
first
i
will
work
and
become
something
for
myself
just
as
you
are
i
will
give
myself
i
will
not
be
taken
too
is
beginning
to
realize
himself
the
strain
of
events
and
the
final
shock
that
he
had
exposed
his
own
child
to
such
peril
act
like
a
stroke
of
lightning
on
the
it
makes
him
see
that
a
house
built
on
lies
shams
and
crime
must
eventually
sink
by
its
own
weight
surrounded
by
those
who
truly
love
and
therefore
understand
him
no
longer
the
pillar
of
society
but
the
man
becomes
conscious
of
his
better
self
where
have
i
been
he
exclaims
you
will
be
horrified
when
you
know
now
i
feel
as
if
i
had
just
recovered
my
senses
after
being
poisoned
but
i
feel
i
feel
that
i
be
young
and
strong
again
oh
come
nearer
closer
around
me
come
betty
come
olaf
come
martha
oh
martha
it
seems
as
though
i
had
never
seen
you
in
all
these
years
and
we
we
have
a
long
earnest
day
of
work
before
us
i
most
of
all
but
let
it
come
gather
close
around
me
you
true
and
faithful
women
i
have
learned
this
in
these
days
it
is
you
women
who
are
the
pillars
of
society
thee
you
have
learned
a
poor
wisdom
no
no
the
spirit
of
truth
and
of
freedom
these
are
the
pillars
of
society
the
spirit
of
truth
and
freedom
is
the
significance
of
the
pillars
of
society
those
who
like
fail
to
realize
this
fact
go
on
patching
up
indian
which
is
ibsen
symbol
for
our
society
but
they
too
must
learn
that
society
is
rotten
to
the
core
that
patching
up
or
reforming
one
sore
spot
merely
drives
the
social
poison
deeper
into
the
system
and
that
all
must
go
to
the
bottom

the
spirit
of
truth
and
freedom
revolutionize
the
world
a
doll
house
in
a
doll
house
ibsen
returns
to
the
subject
so
vital
to
him
the
social
lie
and
duty
this
time
as
manifesting
themselves
in
the
sacred
institution
of
the
home
and
in
the
position
of
woman
in
her
gilded
cage
is
the
beloved
adored
wife
of
he
is
an
admirable
man
rigidly
honest
of
high
moral
ideals
and
passionately
devoted
to
his
wife
and
children
in
short
a
good
man
and
an
enviable
husband
almost
every
mother
would
be
proud
of
such
a
match
for
her
daughter
and
the
latter
would
consider
herself
fortunate
to
become
the
wife
of
such
a
man
too
considers
herself
fortunate
indeed
she
worships
her
husband
believes
in
him
implicitly
and
is
sure
that
if
ever
her
safety
should
be
menaced
her
idol
her
god
would
perform
the
miracle
when
a
woman
loves
as
does
nothing
else
matters
least
of
all
social
legal
or
moral
considerations
therefore
when
her
life
is
threatened
it
is
no
effort
it
is
joy
for
to
forge
her
father
name
to
a
note
and
borrow
cronen
on
it
in
order
to
take
her
sick
husband
to
italy
in
her
eagerness
to
serve
her
husband
and
in
perfect
innocence
of
the
legal
aspect
of
her
act
she
does
not
give
the
matter
much
thought
except
for
her
anxiety
to
shield
him
from
any
emergency
that
may
call
upon
him
to
perform
the
miracle
in
her
behalf
she
works
hard
and
saves
every
penny
of
her
to
pay
back
the
amount
she
borrowed
on
the
forged
check
is
and
gay
apparently
without
depth
who
indeed
would
expect
depth
of
a
doll
a
squirrel
a
her
purpose
in
life
is
to
be
happy
for
her
husband
sake
for
the
sake
of
the
children
to
sing
dance
and
play
with
them
besides
is
she
not
shielded
protected
and
cared
for
who
then
would
suspect
of
depth
but
already
in
the
opening
scene
when
inquires
what
his
precious
squirrel
wants
for
a
christmas
present
quickly
asks
him
for
money
is
it
to
buy
macaroons
or
finery
in
her
talk
with
reveals
her
inner
self
and
forecasts
the
inevitable
debacle
of
her
doll
house
after
telling
her
friend
how
she
had
saved
her
husband
says
when
torvald
gave
me
money
for
clothes
and
so
on
i
never
used
more
than
half
of
it
i
always
bought
the
simplest
things
torvald
never
noticed
anything
but
it
was
often
very
hard
christina
dear
for
nice
to
be
beautifully
dressed
now
is
it
well
and
besides
that
i
made
money
in
other
ways
last
winter
i
was
so
lucky
i
got
a
heap
of
copying
to
do
i
shut
myself
up
every
evening
and
wrote
far
into
the
night
oh
sometimes
i
was
so
tired
so
tired
and
yet
it
was
splendid
to
work
in
that
way
and
earn
money
i
almost
felt
as
if
i
was
a
man
down
deep
in
the
consciousness
of
there
evidently
slumbers
personality
and
character
which
could
come
into
full
bloom
only
through
a
great
miracle
not
the
kind
hopes
for
but
a
miracle
just
the
same
had
borrowed
the
money
from
a
man
with
a
shady
past
in
the
eyes
of
the
community
and
of
the
righteous
moralist
so
long
as
is
allowed
the
little
breathing
space
a
christian
people
grants
to
him
who
has
once
broken
its
laws
he
is
reasonably
human
he
does
not
molest
but
when
becomes
director
of
the
bank
in
which
is
employed
and
threatens
the
man
with
dismissal
naturally
fights
back
for
as
he
says
to
if
need
be
i
shall
fight
as
though
for
my
life
to
keep
my
little
place
in
the
bank
it
not
only
for
the
money
that
matters
least
to
me
it
something
else
well
i
better
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
of
course
you
know
like
every
one
else
that
some
years
ago
i
got
into
trouble
the
matter
never
came
into
court
but
from
that
moment
all
paths
were
barred
to
me
then
i
took
up
the
business
you
know
about
i
was
obliged
to
grasp
at
something
and
i
do
think
i
been
one
of
the
worst
but
now
i
must
clear
out
of
it
all
my
sons
are
growing
up
for
their
sake
i
must
try
to
win
back
as
much
respectability
as
i
can
this
place
in
the
bank
was
the
first
step
and
now
your
husband
wants
to
kick
me
off
the
ladder
back
into
the
mire
helmer
you
evidently
have
no
clear
idea
what
you
have
really
done
but
i
can
assure
you
that
it
was
nothing
more
and
nothing
worse
that
made
me
an
outcast
from
society
but
this
i
may
tell
you
that
if
i
flung
into
the
gutter
a
second
time
you
shall
keep
me
company
even
when
is
confronted
with
this
awful
threat
she
does
not
fear
for
herself
only
for
so
good
so
true
who
has
such
an
aversion
to
debts
but
who
loves
her
so
devotedly
that
for
her
sake
he
would
take
the
blame
upon
himself
but
this
must
never
be
too
begins
a
fight
for
life
for
her
husband
life
and
that
of
her
children
did
not
tell
her
that
the
very
presence
of
a
criminal
like
poisons
the
children
and
is
she
not
a
criminal
assures
her
in
his
male
conceit
that
early
corruption
generally
comes
from
the
mother
side
but
of
course
the
father
influence
may
act
in
the
same
way
and
this
krogstad
has
been
poisoning
his
own
children
for
years
past
by
a
life
of
lies
and
hypocrisy
that
why
i
call
him
morally
ruined
poor
who
can
not
understand
why
a
daughter
has
no
right
to
spare
her
dying
father
anxiety
or
why
a
wife
has
no
right
to
save
her
husband
life
is
surely
not
aware
of
the
true
character
of
her
idol
but
gradually
the
veil
is
lifted
at
first
when
in
reply
to
her
desperate
pleading
for
her
husband
discloses
the
true
reason
for
wanting
to
get
rid
of
him
the
fact
is
he
was
a
college
chum
of
mine
there
was
one
of
those
rash
friendships
between
us
that
one
so
often
repents
later
i
do
mind
confessing
it
he
calls
me
by
my
christian
name
and
he
insists
on
doing
it
even
when
others
are
present
he
delights
in
putting
on
airs
of
familiarity
torvald
here
torvald
there
i
assure
you
it
most
painful
to
me
he
would
make
my
position
at
the
bank
perfectly
unendurable
and
then
again
when
the
final
blow
comes
for
hours
battles
for
her
ideal
never
doubting
for
a
moment
indeed
so
absolutely
sure
is
she
of
her
strong
oak
her
lord
her
god
that
she
would
rather
kill
herself
than
have
him
take
the
blame
for
her
act
the
end
comes
and
with
it
the
doll
house
tumbles
down
and
discards
her
doll
dress
she
sheds
her
skin
as
it
were
proves
himself
a
petty
philistine
a
bully
and
a
coward
as
so
many
good
husbands
when
they
throw
off
their
respectable
cloak
rage
over
crime
subsides
the
moment
the
danger
of
publicity
is
averted
proving
that
like
many
a
moralist
is
not
so
much
incensed
at
offense
as
by
the
fear
of
being
found
out
not
so
finding
out
is
her
salvation
it
is
then
that
she
realizes
how
much
she
has
been
wronged
that
she
is
only
a
plaything
a
doll
to
in
her
disillusionment
she
says
you
have
never
loved
me
you
only
thought
it
amusing
to
be
in
love
with
me
why
nora
what
a
thing
to
say
yes
it
is
so
torvald
while
i
was
at
home
with
father
he
used
to
tell
me
all
his
opinions
and
i
held
the
same
opinions
if
i
had
others
i
concealed
them
because
he
would
not
have
liked
it
he
used
to
call
me
his
doll
child
and
play
with
me
as
i
played
with
my
dolls
then
i
came
to
live
in
your
house
i
mean
i
passed
from
father
hands
into
yours
you
settled
everything
according
to
your
taste
and
i
got
the
same
tastes
as
you
or
i
pretended
to
i
do
know
which
both
ways
perhaps
when
i
look
back
on
it
now
i
seem
to
have
been
living
here
like
a
beggar
from
hand
to
mouth
i
lived
by
performing
tricks
for
you
torvald
but
you
would
have
it
so
you
and
father
have
done
me
a
great
wrong
it
your
fault
that
my
life
has
been
wasted
it
exasperating
can
you
forsake
your
holiest
duties
in
this
way
what
do
you
call
my
holiest
duties
do
you
ask
me
that
your
duties
to
your
husband
and
your
children
i
have
other
duties
equally
sacred
impossible
what
duties
do
you
mean
my
duties
toward
myself
before
all
else
you
are
a
wife
and
a
mother
that
i
no
longer
believe
i
think
that
before
all
else
i
am
a
human
being
just
as
much
as
you
are
or
at
least
i
will
try
to
become
one
i
know
that
most
people
agree
with
you
torvald
and
that
they
say
so
in
books
but
henceforth
i
ca
be
satisfied
with
what
most
people
say
and
what
is
in
books
i
must
think
things
out
for
myself
and
try
to
get
clear
about
them
i
had
been
living
here
these
eight
years
with
a
strange
man
and
had
borne
him
three
children
oh
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
it
i
could
tear
myself
to
pieces
i
ca
spend
the
night
in
a
strange
man
house
is
there
anything
more
degrading
to
woman
than
to
live
with
a
stranger
and
bear
him
children
yet
the
lie
of
the
marriage
institution
decrees
that
she
shall
continue
to
do
so
and
the
social
conception
of
duty
insists
that
for
the
sake
of
that
lie
she
need
be
nothing
else
than
a
plaything
a
doll
a
nonentity
when
closes
behind
her
the
door
of
her
doll
house
she
opens
wide
the
gate
of
life
for
woman
and
proclaims
the
revolutionary
message
that
only
perfect
freedom
and
communion
make
a
true
bond
between
man
and
woman
meeting
in
the
open
without
lies
without
shame
free
from
the
bondage
of
duty
ghosts
the
social
and
revolutionary
significance
of
henrik
ibsen
is
brought
out
with
even
greater
force
in
ghosts
than
in
his
preceding
works
not
only
does
this
pioneer
of
modern
dramatic
art
undermine
in
ghosts
the
social
lie
and
the
paralyzing
effect
of
duty
but
the
uselessness
and
evil
of
sacrifice
the
dreary
lack
of
joy
and
of
purpose
in
work
are
brought
to
light
as
most
pernicious
and
destructive
elements
in
life
having
made
what
her
family
called
a
most
admirable
match
discovers
shortly
after
her
marriage
that
her
husband
is
a
drunkard
and
a
in
her
despair
she
flees
to
her
young
friend
the
divinity
student
but
he
preparing
to
save
souls
even
though
they
be
encased
in
rotten
bodies
sends
back
to
her
husband
and
her
duties
toward
her
home
is
young
and
immature
besides
she
loves
young
his
command
is
law
to
her
she
returns
home
and
for
years
suffers
all
the
misery
and
torture
of
the
damned
that
she
survives
is
due
mainly
to
her
passionate
love
for
the
child
born
of
that
horrible
relationship
her
boy
her
all
in
life
he
must
be
saved
at
any
cost
to
do
that
she
had
sacrificed
her
great
yearning
for
him
and
sent
him
away
from
the
poisonous
atmosphere
of
her
home
and
now
he
has
returned
fine
and
free
much
to
the
disgust
of
whose
limited
vision
can
not
conceive
that
out
in
the
large
world
free
men
and
women
can
live
a
decent
and
creative
life
but
how
is
it
possible
that
a
a
young
man
or
young
woman
with
any
decent
principles
can
endure
to
live
in
that
way
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
world
what
are
they
to
do
a
poor
young
artist
a
poor
girl
it
costs
a
lot
of
money
to
get
married
what
are
they
to
do
what
are
they
to
do
let
me
tell
you
alving
what
they
ought
to
do
they
ought
to
exercise
from
the
first
that
what
they
ought
to
do
such
talk
as
that
wo
go
far
with
young
people
over
head
and
ears
in
love
no
it
would
go
far
how
can
the
authorities
tolerate
such
things
allow
it
to
go
on
in
the
light
of
day
had
i
not
cause
to
be
deeply
concerned
about
your
son
in
circles
where
open
immorality
prevails
and
has
even
a
sort
of
prestige
let
me
tell
you
sir
that
i
have
been
a
constant
in
one
or
two
such
irregular
homes
on
sunday
of
all
days
is
that
the
day
to
enjoy
one
self
well
never
have
i
heard
an
offensive
word
and
still
less
have
i
ever
witnessed
anything
that
could
be
called
immoral
no
do
you
know
when
and
where
i
have
found
immorality
in
artistic
circles
no
thank
heaven
i
do
well
then
allow
me
to
inform
you
i
have
met
with
it
when
one
or
other
of
our
pattern
husbands
and
fathers
has
come
to
paris
to
have
a
look
around
on
his
own
account
and
has
done
the
artists
the
honor
of
visiting
their
humble
haunts
knew
what
was
what
these
gentlemen
could
tell
us
all
about
places
and
things
we
had
never
dreamt
of
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
respectable
men
from
home
here
would
have
you
never
heard
these
respectable
men
when
they
got
home
again
talking
about
the
way
in
which
immorality
was
running
rampant
abroad
yes
of
course
i
have
too
well
you
may
take
their
word
for
it
they
know
what
they
are
talking
about
oh
that
that
great
free
glorious
life
out
there
should
be
defiled
in
such
a
way
is
outraged
and
when
leaves
he
delivers
himself
of
a
tirade
against
for
her
irresponsible
proclivities
to
shirk
her
duty
it
is
only
the
spirit
of
rebellion
that
craves
for
happiness
in
this
life
what
right
have
we
human
beings
to
happiness
no
we
have
to
do
our
duty
and
your
duty
was
to
hold
firmly
to
the
man
you
had
once
chosen
and
to
whom
you
were
bound
by
a
holy
tie
it
was
your
duty
to
bear
with
humility
the
cross
which
a
higher
power
had
for
your
own
good
laid
upon
you
but
instead
of
that
you
rebelliously
cast
away
the
cross
i
was
but
a
poor
instrument
in
a
higher
hand
and
what
a
blessing
has
it
not
been
to
you
all
the
days
of
your
life
that
i
got
you
to
resume
the
yoke
of
duty
and
obedience
the
price
had
to
pay
for
her
yoke
her
duty
and
obedience
staggers
even
when
she
reveals
to
him
the
martyrdom
she
had
endured
those
long
years
you
have
now
spoken
out
pastor
manders
and
you
are
to
speak
publicly
in
memory
of
my
husband
i
shall
not
speak
but
now
i
will
speak
out
a
little
to
you
as
you
have
spoken
to
me
i
want
you
to
know
that
after
nineteen
years
of
marriage
my
husband
remained
as
dissolute
in
his
desires
as
he
was
when
you
married
us
after
oswald
birth
i
thought
alving
seemed
to
be
a
little
better
but
it
did
not
last
long
and
then
i
had
to
struggle
twice
as
hard
fighting
for
life
or
death
so
that
nobody
should
know
what
sort
of
a
man
my
child
father
was
i
had
my
little
son
to
bear
it
for
but
when
the
last
insult
was
added
when
my
own
then
i
swore
to
myself
this
shall
come
to
an
end
and
so
i
took
the
upper
hand
in
the
house
the
whole
control
over
him
and
over
everything
else
for
now
i
had
a
weapon
against
him
you
see
he
dared
not
oppose
me
it
was
then
that
oswald
was
sent
from
home
he
was
in
his
seventh
year
and
was
beginning
to
observe
and
ask
questions
as
children
do
that
i
could
not
bear
i
thought
the
child
must
get
poisoned
by
merely
breathing
the
air
in
this
polluted
home
that
was
why
i
placed
him
out
and
now
you
can
see
too
why
he
was
never
allowed
to
set
foot
inside
his
home
so
long
as
his
father
lived
no
one
knows
what
it
has
cost
me
from
the
day
after
it
shall
be
for
me
as
though
he
who
is
dead
had
never
lived
in
this
house
no
one
shall
be
here
but
my
boy
and
his
mother
within
the
comes
the
noise
of
a
chair
overturned
and
at
the
same
moment
is
heard
sharply
but
whispering
oswald
take
care
are
you
mad
let
me
go
alving
starts
in
terror
ah
stares
wildly
toward
the
door
oswald
is
heard
coughing
and
humming
inside
excited
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
what
is
it
alving
alving
hoarsely
ghosts
the
couple
from
the
conservatory
has
risen
again
ghosts
indeed
sees
this
but
too
clearly
when
she
discovers
that
though
she
did
not
want
to
inherit
a
single
penny
from
the
purchase
money
had
paid
for
her
all
her
sacrifice
did
not
save
from
the
poisoned
heritage
of
his
father
she
learns
soon
enough
that
her
beloved
boy
had
inherited
a
terrible
disease
from
his
father
as
a
result
of
which
he
will
never
again
be
able
to
work
she
also
finds
out
that
for
all
her
freedom
she
has
remained
in
the
clutches
of
ghosts
and
that
she
has
fostered
in
mind
an
ideal
of
his
father
the
more
terrible
because
of
her
own
loathing
for
the
man
too
late
she
realizes
her
fatal
mistake
i
ought
never
to
have
concealed
the
facts
of
life
but
in
my
superstitious
awe
for
duty
and
decency
i
lied
to
my
boy
year
after
year
oh
what
a
coward
what
a
coward
i
have
been
ghosts
when
i
heard
regina
and
oswald
in
there
it
was
as
though
i
saw
the
ghosts
before
me
but
i
almost
think
we
are
all
of
us
ghosts
pastor
manders
it
is
not
only
what
we
have
inherited
from
our
father
and
mother
that
walks
in
us
it
is
all
sorts
of
dead
ideas
and
lifeless
old
beliefs
and
so
forth
they
have
no
vitality
but
they
cling
to
us
all
the
same
and
we
ca
get
rid
of
them
there
must
be
ghosts
all
the
country
over
as
thick
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
and
then
we
are
one
and
all
so
pitifully
afraid
of
the
light
when
you
forced
me
under
the
yoke
you
called
duty
and
obligation
when
you
praised
as
right
and
proper
what
my
whole
soul
rebelled
against
as
something
loathsome
it
was
then
that
i
began
to
look
into
the
seams
of
your
doctrine
i
only
wished
to
pick
at
a
single
knot
but
when
i
had
got
that
undone
the
whole
thing
ravelled
out
and
then
i
understood
that
it
was
all
it
was
a
crime
against
us
both
indeed
a
crime
on
which
the
sacred
institution
is
built
and
for
which
thousands
of
innocent
children
must
pay
with
their
happiness
and
life
while
their
mothers
continue
to
the
very
end
without
ever
learning
how
hideously
criminal
their
life
is
not
so
who
though
at
a
terrible
price
works
herself
out
to
the
truth
aye
even
to
the
height
of
understanding
the
dissolute
life
of
the
father
of
her
child
who
had
lived
in
cramped
provincial
surroundings
and
could
find
no
purpose
in
life
no
outlet
for
his
exuberance
it
is
through
her
child
through
that
all
this
becomes
illumed
to
her
ah
the
joy
of
life
mother
that
a
thing
you
do
know
much
about
in
these
parts
i
have
never
felt
it
here
and
then
too
the
joy
of
work
at
bottom
it
the
same
thing
but
that
too
you
know
nothing
about
here
people
are
brought
up
to
believe
that
work
is
a
curse
and
a
punishment
for
sin
and
that
life
is
something
miserable
something
we
want
to
be
done
with
the
sooner
the
better
have
you
noticed
that
everything
i
have
painted
has
turned
upon
the
joy
of
life
always
always
upon
the
joy
of
life
light
and
sunshine
and
glorious
air
and
faces
radiant
with
happiness
that
is
why
i
am
afraid
of
remaining
at
home
with
you
oswald
you
spoke
of
the
joy
of
life
and
at
that
word
a
new
light
burst
for
me
over
my
life
and
all
it
has
contained
you
ought
to
have
known
your
father
when
he
was
a
young
lieutenant
he
was
brimming
over
with
the
joy
of
life
he
had
no
object
in
life
but
only
an
official
position
he
had
no
work
into
which
he
could
throw
himself
heart
and
soul
he
had
only
business
he
had
not
a
single
comrade
that
knew
what
the
joy
of
life
meant
only
loafers
and
boon
companions
so
that
happened
which
was
sure
to
happen
oswald
my
dear
boy
has
it
shaken
you
very
much
of
course
it
came
upon
me
as
a
great
surprise
but
after
all
it
ca
matter
much
to
me
ca
matter
that
your
father
was
so
infinitely
miserable
of
course
i
can
pity
him
as
i
would
anybody
else
but
nothing
more
your
own
father
oh
there
father
father
i
never
knew
anything
of
father
i
do
remember
anything
about
him
except
that
he
once
made
me
sick
that
a
terrible
way
to
speak
should
not
a
son
love
his
father
all
the
same
when
a
son
has
nothing
to
thank
his
father
for
has
never
known
him
do
you
really
cling
to
the
old
superstition
you
who
are
so
enlightened
in
other
ways
is
that
only
a
superstition
in
truth
a
superstition
one
that
is
kept
like
the
sword
of
damocles
over
the
child
who
does
not
ask
to
be
given
life
and
is
yet
tied
with
a
thousand
chains
to
those
who
bring
him
into
a
cheerless
joyless
and
wretched
world
the
voice
of
henrik
ibsen
in
ghosts
sounds
like
the
trumpets
before
the
walls
of
jericho
into
the
remotest
nooks
and
corners
reaches
his
voice
with
its
thundering
indictment
of
our
moral
cancers
our
social
poisons
our
hideous
crimes
against
unborn
and
born
victims
verily
a
more
revolutionary
condemnation
has
never
been
uttered
in
dramatic
form
before
or
since
the
great
henrik
ibsen
we
need
therefore
not
be
surprised
at
the
vile
abuse
and
denunciation
heaped
upon
ibsen
head
by
the
church
the
state
and
other
moral
eunuchs
but
the
spirit
of
henrik
ibsen
could
not
be
daunted
it
asserted
itself
with
even
greater
defiance
in
an
enemy
of
society
a
powerful
arraignment
of
the
political
and
economic
lie
ibsen
own
confession
of
faith
an
enemy

thomas
stockmann
is
called
to
the
position
of
medical
adviser
to
the
management
of
the
baths
the
main
resource
of
his
native
town
a
sincere
man
of
high
ideals
returns
home
after
an
absence
of
many
years
full
of
the
spirit
of
enterprise
and
progressive
innovation
for
as
he
says
to
his
brother
the
town
i
am
so
glad
and
content
i
feel
so
unspeakably
happy
in
the
midst
of
all
this
growing
germinating
life
after
all
what
a
glorious
time
we
do
live
in
it
is
as
if
a
new
world
were
springing
up
around
us
do
you
really
think
so
well
of
course
you
ca
see
this
as
clearly
as
i
do
you
spent
all
your
life
in
this
place
and
so
your
perceptions
have
been
dulled
but
i
who
had
to
live
up
there
in
that
small
hole
in
the
north
all
those
years
hardly
ever
seeing
a
soul
to
speak
a
stimulating
word
to
me
all
this
affects
me
as
if
i
were
carried
to
the
midst
of
a
crowded
city
i
know
well
enough
that
the
conditions
of
life
are
small
compared
with
many
other
towns
but
here
is
life
growth
an
infinity
of
things
to
work
for
and
to
strive
for
and
that
is
the
main
point
in
this
spirit
sets
to
his
task
after
two
years
of
careful
investigation
he
finds
that
the
baths
are
built
on
a
swamp
full
of
poisonous
germs
and
that
people
who
come
there
for
their
health
will
be
infected
with
fever
is
a
conscientious
physician
he
loves
his
native
town
but
he
loves
his
more
he
considers
it
his
duty
to
communicate
his
discovery
to
the
highest
authority
of
the
town
the
his
brother
is
indeed
an
idealist
else
he
would
know
that
the
man
is
often
lost
in
the
official
besides
is
also
the
president
of
the
board
of
directors
and
one
of
the
heaviest
stockholders
of
the
baths
sufficient
reason
to
upbraid
his
reckless
medical
brother
as
a
dangerous
man
anyhow
you
an
ingrained
propensity
for
going
your
own
way
and
that
in
a
community
is
almost
as
dangerous
the
individual
must
submit
himself
to
the
whole
community
or
to
speak
more
correctly
bow
to
the
authority
that
watches
over
the
welfare
of
all
but
the
is
not
disconcerted
is
an
official
he
is
not
concerned
with
ideals
but
there
is
the
press
that
is
the
medium
for
his
purpose
the
staff
of
the
and
are
deeply
impressed
by
the
discovery
with
one
eye
to
good
copy
and
the
other
to
the
political
chances
they
immediately
put
the
at
the
disposal
of
sees
great
possibilities
for
a
thorough
radical
reform
of
the
whole
life
of
the
community
to
you
as
a
doctor
and
a
man
of
science
this
business
of
the
is
an
isolated
affair
i
fancy
it
has
occurred
to
you
that
a
good
many
other
things
are
connected
with
it
the
swamp
our
whole
municipal
life
stands
and
rots
in
i
think
a
journalist
assumes
an
immense
responsibility
when
he
neglects
an
opportunity
of
aiding
the
masses
the
poor
the
oppressed
i
know
well
enough
that
the
upper
classes
will
call
this
stirring
up
the
people
and
so
forth
but
they
can
do
as
they
please
if
only
my
conscience
is
clear
printer
of
the
chairman
of
the
householders
association
and
agent
for
the
moderation
society
has
like
a
keen
eye
to
business
he
assures
the
of
his
coÃ¶peration
especially
emphasizing
that
it
might
do
you
no
harm
to
have
us
men
at
your
back
we
now
form
a
compact
majority
in
the
town
when
we
really
make
up
our
minds
to
and
always
as
well
doctor
to
have
the
majority
with
you
and
so
i
think
it
would
be
amiss
if
we
made
some
sort
of
a
demonstration
of
course
with
great
moderation
doctor
i
am
always
in
favor
of
moderation
for
moderation
is
a
citizen
first
virtue
at
least
those
are
my
sentiments
truly
is
an
idealist
else
he
would
not
place
so
much
faith
in
the
staff
of
the
who
love
the
people
so
well
that
they
constantly
feed
them
with
phrases
of
democratic
principles
and
of
the
noble
function
of
the
press
while
they
pilfer
their
pockets
that
is
expressed
in
own
words
when
the
daughter
of
returns
a
sentimental
novel
she
was
to
translate
for
the
this
ca
possibly
go
into
the
she
tells
it
is
in
direct
contradiction
to
your
own
opinion
well
but
for
the
sake
of
the
cause
you
do
understand
me
yet
it
is
all
about
a
supernatural
power
that
looks
after
the
good
people
here
on
earth
and
turns
all
things
to
their
advantage
at
last
and
all
the
bad
people
are
punished
yes
but
that
very
fine
it
the
very
thing
the
public
like
and
would
you
supply
the
public
with
such
stuff
why
you
do
believe
one
word
of
it
yourself
you
know
well
enough
that
things
do
really
happen
like
that
you
right
there
but
an
editor
ca
always
do
as
he
likes
he
often
has
to
yield
to
public
opinion
in
small
matters
after
all
politics
is
the
chief
thing
in
life
at
any
rate
for
a
newspaper
and
if
i
want
the
people
to
follow
me
along
the
path
of
emancipation
and
progress
i
must
scare
them
away
if
they
find
such
a
moral
story
down
in
the
cellar
they
much
more
willing
to
stand
what
is
printed
above
it
they
feel
themselves
safer
editors
of
the
stamp
of
seldom
dare
to
express
their
real
opinions
they
can
not
afford
to
scare
away
their
readers
they
generally
yield
to
the
most
ignorant
and
vulgar
public
opinion
they
do
not
set
themselves
up
against
constituted
authority
therefore
the
drops
the
greatest
man
in
town
when
it
learns
that
the
and
the
influential
citizens
are
determined
that
the
truth
shall
be
silenced
the
soundly
denounces
his
brother
rebellion
the
public
does
need
new
ideas
the
public
is
best
served
by
the
good
old
recognized
ideas
that
they
have
already
as
an
official
you
no
right
to
have
any
individual
conviction
the
source
is
poisoned
man
are
you
mad
we
live
by
trafficking
in
filth
and
garbage
the
whole
of
our
developing
social
life
is
rooted
in
a
lie
idle
fancies
or
something
worse
the
man
who
makes
such
offensive
insinuations
against
his
own
native
place
must
be
an
enemy
of
society
and
i
must
bear
such
treatment
in
my
own
house
katrine
what
do
you
think
of
it
indeed
it
is
a
shame
and
an
insult
thomas
but
after
all
your
brother
has
the
power
yes
but
i
have
the
right
ah
yes
right
right
what
is
the
good
of
being
right
when
you
have
any
might
what
no
good
in
a
free
society
to
have
right
on
your
side
you
are
absurd
katrine
and
besides
have
i
the
free
and
independent
press
with
me
the
compact
majority
behind
me
that
might
enough
i
should
think
is
wiser
than
her
husband
for
he
who
has
no
might
need
hope
for
no
right
the
good
has
to
drink
the
bitter
cup
to
the
last
drop
before
he
realizes
the
wisdom
of
his
wife
threatened
by
the
authorities
and
repudiated
by
the
attempts
to
secure
a
hall
wherein
to
hold
a
public
meeting
a
citizen
he
believes
in
the
constitution
and
its
guarantees
he
is
determined
to
maintain
his
right
of
free
expression
but
like
so
many
others
even
most
advanced
liberals
blinded
by
the
spook
of
constitutional
rights
and
free
speech
inevitably
has
to
pay
the
penalty
of
his
credulity
he
finds
every
hall
in
town
closed
against
him
only
one
solitary
citizen
has
the
courage
to
open
his
doors
to
the
persecuted
doctor
his
old
friend
but
the
mob
follows
him
even
there
and
howls
him
down
as
an
enemy
of
society
makes
the
discovery
in
his
battle
with
ignorance
stupidity
and
vested
interests
that
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
truth
and
freedom
in
our
midst
are
the
compact
majority
the
damned
compact
liberal
majority
his
experiences
lead
him
to
the
conclusion
that
the
majority
is
never
right
that
is
one
of
those
conventional
lies
against
which
a
free
thoughtful
man
must
rebel
the
majority
has
might
unhappily
but
right
it
has
not
the
man
who
would
ruin
a
whole
community
must
be
an
enemy
of
society
it
does
matter
if
a
lying
community
is
ruined
you
poison
the
whole
country
in
time
you
will
bring
it
to
such
a
pass
that
the
whole
country
will
deserve
to
perish
and
should
it
come
to
this
i
say
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
perish
the
country
perish
all
its
people
driven
out
of
the
place
hooted
and
jeered
by
the
mob
barely
escapes
with
his
life
and
seeks
safety
in
his
home
only
to
find
everything
demolished
there
in
due
time
he
is
repudiated
by
the
grocer
the
baker
and
the
candlestick
maker
the
landlord
of
course
is
very
sorry
for
him
the
stockmanns
have
always
paid
their
rent
regularly
but
it
would
injure
his
reputation
to
have
such
an
avowed
rebel
for
a
tenant
the
grocer
is
sorry
and
the
butcher
too
but
they
can
not
jeopardize
their
business
finally
the
board
of
education
sends
expressions
of
regret
is
an
excellent
teacher
and
the
boys
of
stockmann
splendid
pupils
but
it
would
contaminate
the
other
children
were
the
stockmanns
allowed
to
remain
at
school
and
again
learns
a
vital
lesson
but
he
will
not
submit
he
will
be
strong
should
i
let
myself
be
beaten
off
the
field
by
public
opinion
and
the
compact
majority
and
such
deviltry
no
thanks
besides
what
i
want
is
so
simple
so
clear
and
straightforward
i
only
want
to
drive
into
the
heads
of
these
curs
that
the
liberals
are
the
worst
foes
of
free
men
that
wring
the
necks
of
all
young
living
truths
that
considerations
of
expediency
turn
morality
and
righteousness
upside
down
until
life
is
simply
hideous
i
do
see
any
man
free
and
brave
enough
to
dare
the
truth
the
strongest
man
is
he
who
stands
most
alone
a
confession
of
faith
indeed
because
henrik
ibsen
although
recognized
as
a
great
dramatic
artist
remained
alone
in
his
stand
as
a
revolutionist
his
dramatic
art
without
his
glorious
rebellion
against
every
authoritative
institution
against
every
social
and
moral
lie
against
every
vestige
of
bondage
were
inconceivable
just
as
his
art
would
lose
human
significance
were
his
love
of
truth
and
freedom
lacking
already
in
brand
henrik
ibsen
demanded
all
or
nothing
no
moderation
no
compromise
of
any
sort
in
the
struggle
for
the
ideal
his
proud
defiance
his
enthusiastic
daring
his
utter
indifference
to
consequences
are
henrik
ibsen
bugle
call
heralding
a
new
dawn
and
the
birth
of
a
new
race
strindberg
the
reproach
was
levelled
against
my
tragedy
father
that
it
was
so
sad
as
though
one
wanted
merry
tragedies
people
clamour
for
the
joy
of
life
and
the
theatrical
managers
order
farces
as
though
the
joy
of
life
consisted
in
being
foolish
and
in
describing
people
as
if
they
were
each
and
all
afflicted
with
vitus
dance
or
idiocy
i
find
the
joy
of
life
in
the
powerful
cruel
struggle
of
life
and
my
enjoyment
in
discovering
something
in
learning
something
the
passionate
desire
to
discover
something
to
learn
something
has
made
of
august
strindberg
a
keen
dissector
of
souls
above
all
of
his
own
soul
surely
there
is
no
figure
in
contemporary
literature
outside
of
tolstoy
that
laid
bare
the
most
secret
nooks
and
corners
of
his
own
soul
with
the
sincerity
of
august
strindberg
one
so
relentlessly
honest
with
himself
could
be
no
less
with
others
that
explains
the
bitter
opposition
and
hatred
of
his
critics
they
did
not
object
so
much
to
strindberg
but
that
he
should
have
dared
to
torture
to
hold
up
his
searching
mirror
to
sore
spots
that
they
could
not
forgive
especially
is
this
true
of
woman
for
centuries
she
has
been
lulled
into
a
trance
by
the
songs
of
the
troubadours
who
paid
homage
to
her
goodness
her
sweetness
her
selflessness
and
above
all
her
noble
motherhood
and
though
she
is
beginning
to
appreciate
that
all
this
incense
has
befogged
her
mind
and
paralyzed
her
soul
she
hates
to
give
up
the
tribute
laid
at
her
feet
by
sentimental
moonshiners
of
the
past
to
be
sure
it
is
rude
to
turn
on
the
full
searchlight
upon
a
painted
face
but
how
is
one
to
know
what
is
back
of
the
paint
and
artifice
august
strindberg
hated
artifice
with
all
the
passion
of
his
being
hence
his
severe
criticism
of
woman
perhaps
it
was
his
tragedy
to
see
her
as
she
really
is
and
not
as
she
appears
in
her
trance
to
love
with
open
eyes
is
indeed
a
tragedy
and
strindberg
loved
woman
all
his
life
long
he
yearned
for
her
love
as
mother
as
wife
as
companion
but
his
longing
for
and
his
need
of
her
were
the
crucible
of
strindberg
as
they
have
been
the
crucible
of
every
man
even
of
the
mightiest
spirit
why
it
is
so
is
best
expressed
in
the
words
of
the
old
nurse
in
the
father
because
all
you
men
great
and
small
are
children
every
man
of
you
the
child
in
man
and
the
greater
the
man
the
more
dominant
the
child
in
him
has
ever
succumbed
to
the
earth
spirit
woman
and
as
long
as
that
is
her
only
drawing
power
man
with
all
his
strength
and
genius
will
ever
be
at
her
feet
the
earth
spirit
is
motherhood
carrying
the
race
in
its
womb
the
flame
of
life
luring
the
moth
often
against
its
will
to
destruction
in
all
of
strindberg
plays
we
see
the
flame
of
life
at
work
ravishing
man
brain
consuming
man
faith
rousing
man
passion
always
always
the
flame
of
life
is
drawing
its
victims
with
irresistible
force
august
strindberg
arraignment
of
that
force
is
at
the
same
time
a
confession
of
faith
he
too
was
the
child
of
woman
and
utterly
helpless
before
her
the
father
the
father
portrays
the
tragedy
of
a
man
and
a
woman
struggling
for
the
possession
of
their
child
the
father
a
cavalry
captain
is
intellectual
a
freethinker
a
man
of
ideas
his
wife
is
narrow
selfish
and
unscrupulous
in
her
methods
when
her
antagonism
is
wakened
other
members
of
the
family
are
the
wife
mother
a
spiritualist
and
the
old
nurse
ignorant
and
superstitious
the
father
feels
that
the
child
would
be
poisoned
in
such
an
atmosphere
this
house
is
full
of
women
who
all
want
to
have
their
say
about
my
child
my
wants
to
make
a
spiritualist
of
her
laura
wants
her
to
be
an
artist
the
governess
wants
her
to
be
a
methodist
old
margret
a
baptist
and
the
want
her
to
join
the
salvation
army
it
wo
do
to
try
to
make
a
soul
in
patches
like
that
i
who
have
the
chief
right
to
try
to
form
her
character
am
constantly
opposed
in
my
efforts
and
that
why
i
have
decided
to
send
her
away
from
home
but
it
is
not
only
because
the
does
not
believe
in
making
a
soul
in
patches
that
he
wants
to
rescue
the
child
from
the
environment
nor
because
he
plans
to
make
her
an
image
of
himself
it
is
rather
because
he
wants
her
to
grow
up
with
a
healthy
outlook
on
life
i
do
want
to
be
a
procurer
for
my
daughter
and
educate
her
exclusively
for
matrimony
for
then
if
she
were
left
unmarried
she
might
have
bitter
days
on
the
other
hand
i
want
to
influence
her
toward
a
career
that
requires
a
long
course
of
training
which
would
be
entirely
thrown
away
if
she
should
marry
i
want
her
to
be
a
teacher
if
she
remains
unmarried
she
will
be
able
to
support
herself
and
at
any
rate
she
would
be
any
worse
off
than
the
poor
schoolmasters
who
have
to
share
their
salaries
with
a
family
if
she
marries
she
can
use
her
knowledge
in
the
education
of
her
children
while
the
father
love
is
concerned
with
the
development
of
the
child
that
of
the
mother
is
interested
mainly
in
the
possession
of
the
child
therefore
she
fights
the
man
with
every
means
at
her
command
even
to
the
point
of
instilling
the
poison
of
doubt
into
his
mind
by
hints
that
he
is
not
the
father
of
the
child
not
only
does
she
seek
to
drive
her
husband
mad
but
through
skillful
intrigue
she
leads
every
one
including
the
doctor
to
believe
that
he
is
actually
insane
finally
even
the
old
nurse
is
induced
to
betray
him
she
slips
the
straitjacket
over
him
adding
the
last
touch
to
the
treachery
robbed
of
his
faith
broken
in
spirit
and
subdued
the
dies
a
victim
of
the
earth
spirit
of
motherhood
which
slays
the
man
for
the
sake
of
the
child
laura
herself
will
have
it
so
when
she
tells
her
husband
you
have
fulfilled
your
function
as
an
unfortunately
necessary
father
and
breadwinner
you
are
not
needed
any
longer
and
you
must
go
critics
have
pronounced
the
father
an
aberration
of
strindberg
mind
utterly
false
and
distorted
but
that
is
because
they
hate
to
face
the
truth
in
strindberg
however
the
truth
is
his
most
revolutionary
significance
the
father
contains
two
basic
truths
motherhood
much
praised
poetized
and
hailed
as
a
wonderful
thing
is
in
reality
very
often
the
greatest
deterrent
influence
in
the
life
of
the
child
because
it
is
not
primarily
concerned
with
the
potentialities
of
character
and
growth
of
the
child
on
the
contrary
it
is
interested
chiefly
in
the
birthgiver
that
is
the
mother
therefore
the
mother
is
the
most
subjective
and
conservative
obstacle
she
binds
the
child
to
herself
with
a
thousand
threads
which
never
grant
sufficient
freedom
for
mental
and
spiritual
expansion
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
as
bitter
as
strindberg
to
realize
this
there
are
of
course
exceptional
mothers
who
continue
to
grow
with
the
child
but
the
average
mother
is
like
the
hen
with
her
brood
forever
fretting
about
her
chicks
if
they
venture
a
step
away
from
the
coop
the
mother
enslaves
with
kindness
a
bondage
harder
to
bear
and
more
difficult
to
escape
than
the
brutal
fist
of
the
father
strindberg
himself
experienced
it
and
nearly
every
one
who
has
ever
attempted
to
outgrow
the
soul
strings
of
the
mother
in
portraying
motherhood
as
it
really
is
august
strindberg
is
conveying
a
vital
and
revolutionary
message
namely
that
true
motherhood
even
as
fatherhood
does
not
consist
in
molding
the
child
according
to
one
image
or
in
imposing
upon
it
one
own
ideas
and
notions
but
in
allowing
the
child
freedom
and
opportunity
to
grow
harmoniously
according
to
its
own
potentialities
unhampered
and
unmarred
the
child
was
august
strindberg
religion
perhaps
because
of
his
own
very
tragic
childhood
and
youth
he
was
like
father
time
in
jude
the
obscure
a
giant
child
and
as
he
has
say
of
the
in
the
father
he
had
either
come
too
early
into
the
world
or
perhaps
was
not
wanted
at
all
yes
that
how
it
was
the
replies
my
father
and
my
mother
will
was
against
my
coming
into
the
world
and
consequently
i
was
born
without
a
will
the
horror
of
having
been
brought
into
the
world
undesired
and
unloved
stamped
its
indelible
mark
on
august
strindberg
it
never
left
him
nor
did
fear
and
hunger
the
two
terrible
phantoms
of
his
childhood
indeed
the
child
was
strindberg
religion
his
faith
his
passion
is
it
then
surprising
that
he
should
have
resented
woman
attitude
towards
the
man
as
a
mere
means
to
the
child
or
in
the
words
of
as
the
function
of
father
and
breadwinner
that
this
is
the
attitude
of
woman
is
of
course
denied
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
it
holds
good
not
only
of
the
average
unthinking
woman
but
even
of
many
feminists
of
and
no
doubt
they
were
even
more
antagonistic
to
the
male
in
strindberg
time
it
is
only
too
true
that
woman
is
paying
back
what
she
has
endured
for
centuries
humiliation
subjection
and
bondage
but
making
oneself
free
through
the
enslavement
of
another
is
by
no
means
a
step
toward
advancement
woman
must
grow
to
understand
that
the
father
is
as
vital
a
factor
in
the
life
of
the
child
as
is
the
mother
such
a
realization
would
help
very
much
to
minimize
the
conflict
between
the
sexes
of
course
that
is
not
the
only
cause
of
the
conflict
there
is
another
as
expressed
by
do
you
remember
when
i
first
came
into
your
life
i
was
like
a
second
mother
i
loved
you
as
my
child
but
when
the
nature
of
your
feelings
changed
and
you
appeared
as
my
lover
i
blushed
and
your
embraces
were
joy
that
was
followed
by
remorseful
conscience
as
if
my
blood
were
ashamed
the
vile
thought
instilled
into
woman
by
the
church
and
puritanism
that
sex
expression
without
the
purpose
of
procreation
is
immoral
has
been
a
most
degrading
influence
it
has
poisoned
the
life
of
thousands
of
women
who
similarly
suffer
remorseful
conscience
therefore
their
disgust
and
hatred
of
the
man
therefore
also
the
conflict
must
it
always
be
thus
even
strindberg
does
not
think
so
else
he
would
not
plead
in
behalf
of
divorce
between
man
and
wife
so
that
lovers
may
be
born
he
felt
that
until
man
and
woman
cease
to
have
remorseful
consciences
because
of
the
most
elemental
expression
of
the
joy
of
life
they
can
not
realize
the
purity
and
beauty
of
sex
nor
appreciate
its
ecstasy
as
the
source
of
full
understanding
and
creative
harmony
between
male
and
female
till
then
man
and
woman
must
remain
in
conflict
and
the
child
pay
the
penalty
august
strindberg
as
one
of
the
numberless
innocent
victims
of
this
terrible
conflict
cries
out
bitterly
against
it
with
the
artistic
genius
and
strength
that
compel
attention
to
the
significance
of
his
message
countess
julie
in
his
masterly
preface
to
this
play
august
strindberg
writes
the
fact
that
my
tragedy
makes
a
sad
impression
on
many
is
the
fault
of
the
many
when
we
become
strong
as
were
the
first
french
revolutionaries
it
will
make
an
exclusively
pleasant
and
cheerful
impression
to
see
the
royal
parks
cleared
of
rotting
superannuated
trees
which
have
too
long
stood
in
the
way
of
others
with
equal
right
to
vegetate
their
full
lifetime
it
will
make
a
good
impression
in
the
same
sense
as
does
the
sight
of
the
death
of
an
incurable
what
a
wealth
of
revolutionary
thought
were
we
to
realize
that
those
who
will
clear
society
of
the
rotting
superannuated
trees
that
have
so
long
been
standing
in
the
way
of
others
entitled
to
an
equal
share
in
life
must
be
as
strong
as
the
great
revolutionists
of
the
past
indeed
strindberg
is
no
trimmer
no
cheap
reformer
no
patchworker
therefore
his
inability
to
remain
fixed
or
to
content
himself
with
accepted
truths
therefore
also
his
great
versatility
his
deep
grasp
of
the
subtlest
phases
of
life
was
he
not
forever
the
seeker
the
restless
spirit
roaming
the
earth
ever
in
the
of
the
old
to
give
birth
to
the
new
how
then
could
he
be
other
than
relentless
and
grim
and
brutally
frank
countess
julie
a
tragedy
is
no
doubt
a
brutally
frank
portrayal
of
the
most
intimate
thoughts
of
man
and
of
the
antagonism
between
classes
brutally
frank
because
august
strindberg
strips
both
of
their
glitter
their
sham
and
pretense
that
we
may
see
that
at
bottom
there
not
so
much
difference
between
people
and
people
who
in
modern
dramatic
art
is
there
to
teach
us
that
lesson
with
the
insight
of
an
august
strindberg
he
who
had
been
tossed
about
all
his
life
between
the
decadent
traditions
of
his
aristocratic
father
and
the
grim
sordid
reality
of
the
class
of
his
mother
he
who
had
been
begotten
through
the
physical
mastery
of
his
father
and
the
physical
subserviency
of
his
mother
verily
strindberg
knew
whereof
he
spoke
for
he
spoke
with
his
soul
a
language
whose
significance
is
illuminating
compelling
inherited
the
primitive
intense
passion
of
her
mother
and
the
neurotic
aristocratic
tendencies
of
her
father
added
to
this
heritage
is
the
call
of
the
wild
the
intense
summer
heat
when
the
blood
turns
to
fire
and
when
all
are
in
a
holiday
spirit
full
of
gladness
and
rank
is
flung
aside
feels
when
too
late
that
the
barrier
of
rank
reared
through
the
ages
by
wealth
and
power
is
not
flung
aside
with
impunity
therein
the
vicious
brutality
the
boundless
injustice
of
rank
the
people
on
the
estate
of
father
are
celebrating
eve
with
dance
song
and
revelry
the
count
is
absent
and
graciously
mingles
with
the
servants
but
once
having
tasted
the
simple
abandon
of
the
people
once
having
thrown
off
the
artifice
and
superficiality
of
her
aristocratic
decorum
her
suppressed
passions
leap
into
full
flame
and
throws
herself
into
the
arms
of
her
father
valet
not
because
of
love
for
the
man
nor
yet
openly
and
freely
but
as
persons
of
her
station
may
do
when
carried
away
by
the
moment
the
woman
in
pursues
the
male
follows
him
into
the
kitchen
plays
with
him
as
with
a
pet
dog
and
then
feigns
indignation
when
aroused
makes
advances
how
dare
he
the
servant
the
lackey
even
insinuate
that
she
would
have
him
i
the
lady
of
the
house
i
honor
the
people
with
my
presence
i
in
love
with
my
coachman
i
who
step
down
how
well
strindberg
knows
the
psychology
of
the
upper
classes
how
well
he
understands
that
their
graciousness
their
charity
their
interest
in
the
common
people
is
after
all
nothing
but
arrogance
blind
conceit
of
their
own
importance
and
ignorance
of
the
character
of
the
people
even
though
is
a
servant
he
has
his
pride
he
has
his
dreams
i
was
not
hired
to
be
your
plaything
he
says
to
i
think
too
much
of
myself
for
that
strange
is
it
not
that
those
who
serve
and
drudge
for
others
should
think
so
much
of
themselves
as
to
refuse
to
be
played
with
stranger
still
that
they
should
indulge
in
dreams
says
do
you
know
how
people
in
high
life
look
from
the
they
look
like
hawks
and
eagles
whose
backs
one
seldom
sees
for
they
soar
up
above
i
lived
in
a
hovel
provided
by
the
state
with
seven
brothers
and
sisters
and
a
pig
out
on
a
barren
stretch
where
nothing
grew
not
even
a
tree
but
from
the
window
i
could
see
the
count
park
walls
with
apple
trees
rising
above
them
that
was
the
garden
of
paradise
and
there
stood
many
angry
angels
with
flaming
swords
protecting
it
but
for
all
that
i
and
other
boys
found
the
way
to
the
tree
of
life
now
you
despise
me
i
thought
if
it
is
true
that
the
thief
on
the
cross
could
enter
heaven
and
dwell
among
the
angels
it
was
strange
that
a
pauper
child
on
god
earth
could
not
go
into
the
castle
park
and
play
with
the
countess
daughter
what
i
wanted
i
do
know
you
were
unattainable
but
through
the
vision
of
you
i
was
made
to
realize
how
hopeless
it
was
to
rise
above
the
conditions
of
my
birth
what
rich
food
for
thought
in
the
above
for
all
of
us
and
for
the
jeans
the
people
who
do
not
know
what
they
want
yet
feel
the
cruelty
of
a
world
that
keeps
the
pauper
child
out
of
the
castle
of
his
dreams
away
from
joy
and
play
and
beauty
the
injustice
and
the
bitterness
of
it
all
that
places
the
stigma
of
birth
as
an
impassable
obstacle
a
fatal
imperative
excluding
one
from
the
table
of
life
with
the
result
of
producing
such
terrible
effects
on
the
julies
and
the
jeans
the
one
unnerved
made
helpless
and
useless
by
affluence
ease
and
idleness
the
other
enslaved
and
bound
by
service
and
dependence
even
when
wants
to
he
can
not
rise
above
his
condition
when
asks
him
to
embrace
her
to
love
her
he
replies
i
ca
as
long
as
we
are
in
this
house
there
is
the
count
your
father
i
need
only
to
see
his
gloves
lying
in
a
chair
to
feel
my
own
insignificance
i
have
only
to
hear
his
bell
to
start
like
a
nervous
horse
and
now
that
i
see
his
boots
standing
there
so
stiff
and
proper
i
feel
like
bowing
and
scraping
i
account
for
it
but
but
ah
it
is
that
damned
servant
in
my
back
i
believe
if
the
count
came
here
now
and
told
me
to
cut
my
throat
i
would
do
it
on
the
spot
superstition
and
prejudice
taught
in
childhood
ca
be
uprooted
in
a
moment
no
superstition
and
prejudice
can
not
be
uprooted
in
a
moment
nor
in
years
the
awe
of
authority
servility
before
station
and
wealth
these
are
the
curse
of
the
jean
class
that
makes
such
cringing
slaves
of
them
cringing
before
those
who
are
above
them
tyrannical
and
overbearing
toward
those
who
are
below
them
for
has
the
potentiality
of
the
master
in
him
as
much
as
that
of
the
slave
yet
degrading
as
the
damned
servant
reacts
upon
it
is
much
more
terrible
in
its
effect
upon
the
cook
the
dull
dumb
animal
who
has
so
little
left
of
the
spirit
of
independence
that
she
has
lost
even
the
ambition
to
rise
above
her
condition
thus
when
the
betrothed
of
jean
discovers
that
her
mistress
had
given
herself
to
him
she
is
indignant
that
her
lady
should
have
so
much
forgotten
her
station
as
to
stoop
to
her
father
valet
i
do
want
to
be
here
in
this
house
any
longer
where
one
can
not
respect
one
betters
why
should
one
respect
them
yes
you
can
say
that
you
are
so
smart
but
i
do
want
to
serve
people
who
behave
so
it
reflects
on
oneself
i
think
yes
but
it
a
comfort
that
they
not
a
bit
better
than
we
no
i
do
think
so
for
if
they
are
not
better
no
use
in
our
trying
to
better
ourselves
in
this
world
and
to
think
of
the
count
think
of
him
who
has
had
so
much
sorrow
all
his
days
no
i
do
want
to
stay
in
this
house
any
longer
and
to
think
of
it
being
with
such
as
you
if
it
had
been
the
lieutenant
i
have
never
lowered
my
position
let
any
one
say
if
they
can
that
the
count
cook
has
had
anything
to
do
with
the
riding
master
or
the
swineherd
let
them
come
and
say
it
such
dignity
and
morality
are
indeed
pathetic
because
they
indicate
how
completely
serfdom
may
annihilate
even
the
longing
for
something
higher
and
better
in
the
breast
of
a
human
being
the
kristins
represent
the
greatest
obstacle
to
social
growth
the
deadlock
in
the
conflict
between
the
classes
on
the
other
hand
the
jeans
with
all
their
longing
for
higher
possibilities
often
become
brutalized
in
the
hard
school
of
life
though
in
the
conflict
with
shows
brutality
only
at
the
critical
moment
when
it
becomes
a
question
of
life
and
death
a
moment
that
means
discovery
and
consequent
ruin
or
safety
for
both
though
the
male
is
aroused
in
him
pleads
with
not
to
play
with
fire
begs
her
to
return
to
her
room
and
not
to
give
the
servants
a
chance
for
gossip
and
when
later
suggests
his
room
for
a
hiding
place
that
may
escape
the
approaching
it
is
to
save
her
from
their
songs
full
of
insinuation
and
ribaldry
finally
when
the
inevitable
happens
when
as
a
result
of
their
closeness
in
room
of
their
overwrought
nerves
their
intense
passion
the
avalanche
of
sex
sweeps
them
off
their
feet
forgetful
of
station
birth
and
conventions
and
they
return
to
the
kitchen
it
is
again
who
is
willing
to
bear
his
share
of
the
responsibility
i
care
to
shirk
my
share
of
the
blame
he
tells
but
do
you
think
any
one
of
my
position
would
have
dared
to
raise
his
eyes
to
you
if
you
had
not
invited
it
there
is
more
truth
in
this
statement
than
the
julies
can
grasp
namely
that
even
servants
have
their
passions
and
feelings
that
can
not
long
be
trifled
with
with
impunity
the
jeans
know
that
it
is
the
glitter
of
brass
not
gold
that
dazzles
us
from
below
and
that
the
eagle
back
is
gray
like
the
rest
of
him
for
says
i
sorry
to
have
to
realize
that
all
that
i
have
looked
up
to
is
not
worth
while
and
it
pains
me
to
see
you
fallen
lower
than
your
cook
as
it
pains
me
to
see
autumn
blossoms
whipped
to
pieces
by
the
cold
rain
and
transformed
into
dirt
it
is
this
force
that
helps
to
transform
the
blossom
into
dirt
that
august
strindberg
emphasizes
in
the
father
for
the
child
born
against
the
will
of
its
parents
must
also
be
without
will
and
too
weak
to
bear
the
stress
and
storm
of
life
in
countess
julie
this
idea
recurs
with
even
more
tragic
effect
too
had
been
brought
into
the
world
against
her
mother
wishes
indeed
so
much
did
her
mother
dread
the
thought
of
a
child
that
she
was
always
ill
she
often
had
cramps
and
acted
queerly
often
hiding
in
the
orchard
or
the
attic
added
to
this
horror
was
the
conflict
the
relentless
war
of
traditions
between
aristocratic
father
and
her
mother
descended
from
the
people
this
was
the
heritage
of
the
innocent
victim
an
autumn
blossom
blown
into
fragments
by
lack
of
stability
lack
of
love
and
lack
of
harmony
in
other
words
while
is
broken
and
weakened
by
her
inheritance
and
environment
is
hardened
by
his
when
kills
the
bird
which
wants
to
rescue
from
the
ruins
of
her
life
it
is
not
so
much
out
of
real
cruelty
as
it
is
because
the
character
of
was
molded
in
the
relentless
school
of
necessity
in
which
only
those
survive
who
have
the
determination
to
act
in
time
of
danger
for
as
says
miss
julie
i
see
that
you
are
unhappy
i
know
that
you
are
suffering
but
i
can
not
understand
you
among
my
kind
there
is
no
nonsense
of
this
sort
we
love
as
we
play
when
work
gives
us
time
we
have
the
whole
day
and
night
for
it
as
you
here
we
have
the
key
to
the
psychology
of
the
utter
helplessness
and
weakness
of
the
julie
type
and
of
the
brutality
of
the
jeans
the
one
the
result
of
an
empty
life
of
parasitic
leisure
of
a
useless
purposeless
existence
the
other
the
effect
of
too
little
time
for
development
for
maturity
and
depth
of
too
much
toil
to
permit
the
growth
of
the
finer
traits
in
the
human
soul
august
strindberg
himself
the
result
of
the
class
conflict
between
his
parents
never
felt
at
home
with
either
of
them
all
his
life
he
was
galled
by
the
irreconcilability
of
the
classes
and
though
he
was
no
sermonizer
in
the
sense
of
offering
a
definite
panacea
for
individual
or
social
ills
yet
with
master
touch
he
painted
the
degrading
effects
of
class
distinction
and
its
tragic
antagonisms
in
countess
julie
he
popularized
one
of
the
most
vital
problems
of
our
age
and
gave
to
the
world
a
work
powerful
in
its
grasp
of
elemental
emotions
laying
bare
the
human
soul
behind
the
mask
of
social
tradition
and
class
culture
comrades
although
comrades
was
written
in
it
is
in
a
measure
the
most
play
of
strindberg
so
thoroughly
modern
that
one
at
all
conversant
with
the
that
inspired
comrades
could
easily
point
out
the
type
of
character
portrayed
in
the
play
it
is
a
comedy
of
marriage
the
kind
of
marriage
that
lacks
social
and
legal
security
in
the
form
of
a
ceremony
but
retains
all
the
petty
conventions
of
the
marriage
institution
the
results
of
such
an
anomaly
are
indeed
ludicrous
when
viewed
from
a
distance
but
very
tragic
for
those
who
play
a
part
in
it
and
his
wife
are
swedish
artists
residing
in
paris
they
are
both
painters
of
course
they
share
the
same
living
quarters
and
although
each
has
a
separate
room
the
arrangement
does
not
hinder
them
from
trying
to
regulate
each
other
movements
thus
when
does
not
arrive
on
time
to
keep
her
engagement
with
her
model
is
provoked
and
when
he
takes
the
liberty
to
chide
her
for
her
tardiness
his
wife
is
indignant
at
the
invasiveness
of
her
husband
because
women
of
the
type
of
are
as
sensitive
to
fair
criticism
as
their
sisters
nor
is
different
in
her
concept
of
love
which
is
expressed
in
the
following
dialogue
will
you
be
very
good
very
very
good
i
always
want
to
be
good
to
you
my
friend
who
has
sent
her
painting
to
the
exhibition
wants
to
make
use
of
goodness
to
secure
the
grace
of
one
of
the
art
jurors
you
would
not
make
a
sacrifice
for
your
wife
would
you
go
begging
no
i
do
want
to
do
that
immediately
concludes
that
he
does
not
love
her
and
that
moreover
he
is
jealous
of
her
art
there
is
a
scene
soon
recovers
but
bent
on
gaining
her
purpose
she
changes
her
manner
axel
let
be
friends
and
hear
me
a
moment
do
you
think
that
my
position
in
your
house
for
it
is
yours
is
agreeable
to
me
you
support
me
you
pay
for
my
studying
at
julian
while
you
yourself
can
not
afford
instruction
do
you
think
i
see
how
you
sit
and
wear
out
yourself
and
your
talent
on
these
drawings
and
are
able
to
paint
only
in
leisure
moments
you
been
able
to
afford
models
for
yourself
while
you
pay
mine
five
francs
an
hour
you
do
know
how
good
how
noble
how
sacrificing
you
are
and
also
you
do
know
how
i
suffer
to
see
you
toil
so
for
me
oh
axel
you
ca
know
how
i
feel
my
position
what
am
i
to
you
of
what
use
am
i
in
your
house
oh
i
blush
when
i
think
about
it
what
talk
is
a
man
to
support
his
wife
i
do
want
it
and
you
axel
you
must
help
me
i
not
your
equal
when
it
like
that
but
i
could
be
if
you
would
humble
yourself
once
just
once
do
think
that
you
are
alone
in
going
to
one
of
the
jury
to
say
a
good
word
for
another
if
it
were
for
yourself
it
would
be
another
matter
but
for
me
forgive
me
now
i
beg
of
you
as
nicely
as
i
know
how
lift
me
from
my
humiliating
position
to
your
side
and
i
be
so
grateful
i
shall
never
trouble
you
again
with
reminding
you
of
my
position
never
axel
yet
though
gracefully
accepts
everything
does
for
her
with
as
little
compunction
as
the
ordinary
wife
she
does
not
give
as
much
in
return
as
the
latter
on
the
contrary
she
exploits
in
a
thousand
ways
squanders
his
money
and
lives
the
life
of
the
typical
wifely
parasite
august
strindberg
could
not
help
attacking
with
much
bitterness
such
a
farce
and
outrage
parading
in
the
disguise
of
radicalism
for
is
not
an
exceptional
isolated
case
as
when
strindberg
satirized
the
the
majority
of
emancipated
women
are
willing
to
accept
like
everything
from
the
man
and
yet
feel
highly
indignant
if
he
asks
in
return
the
simple
comforts
of
married
life
the
ordinary
wife
at
least
does
not
pretend
to
play
an
important
rÃ´le
in
the
life
of
her
husband
but
the
berthas
deceive
themselves
and
others
with
the
notion
that
the
emancipated
wife
is
a
great
moral
force
an
inspiration
to
the
man
whereas
in
reality
she
is
often
a
exploiter
of
the
work
and
ideas
of
the
man
a
heavy
handicap
to
his
retarding
his
growth
as
effectively
as
did
her
grandmothers
in
the
long
ago
takes
advantage
of
affection
to
further
her
own
artistic
ambitions
just
as
the
church
and
state
married
woman
uses
her
husband
love
to
advance
her
social
ambitions
it
never
occurs
to
that
she
is
no
less
despicable
than
her
legally
married
sister
she
can
not
understand
opposition
to
an
art
that
clamors
only
for
approval
distinction
and
decorations
however
can
not
resist
pleadings
he
visits
the
patron
saint
of
the
salon
who
by
the
way
is
not
roubey
but
mme
roubey
for
she
is
the
president
of
the
protective
society
what
chance
would
have
with
one
of
her
own
sex
in
authority
hence
her
husband
must
be
victimized
during
absence
learns
that
his
picture
has
been
refused
by
the
salon
while
hers
is
accepted
she
is
not
in
the
least
disturbed
nor
at
all
concerned
over
the
effect
of
the
news
on
on
the
contrary
she
is
rather
pleased
because
so
many
women
are
refused
that
a
man
might
put
up
with
it
and
be
made
to
feel
it
once
in
her
triumph
attitude
to
becomes
overbearing
she
humiliates
him
belittles
his
art
and
even
plans
to
humble
him
before
the
guests
invited
to
celebrate
artistic
success
but
is
tearing
himself
free
from
the
meshes
of
his
decaying
love
he
begins
to
see
as
she
is
her
unscrupulousness
in
money
matters
her
ceaseless
effort
to
emasculate
him
in
a
terrible
word
tussle
he
tells
her
i
had
once
been
free
but
you
clipped
the
hair
of
my
strength
while
my
tired
head
lay
in
your
lap
during
sleep
you
stole
my
best
blood
in
the
last
act
discovers
that
had
generously
changed
the
numbers
on
the
paintings
in
order
to
give
her
a
better
chance
it
was
picture
that
was
chosen
as
work
she
feels
ashamed
and
humiliated
but
it
is
too
late
leaves
her
with
the
exclamation
i
want
to
meet
my
comrades
in
the
cafÃ©
but
at
home
i
want
a
wife
a
characteristic
sidelight
in
the
play
is
given
by
the
conversation
of
the
divorced
wife
of
she
comes
to
bertha
with
a
bitter
tirade
against
the
doctor
because
he
gives
her
insufficient
alimony
and
now
that
the
girls
are
grown
up
and
about
to
start
in
life
now
he
writes
us
that
he
is
bankrupt
and
that
he
ca
send
us
more
than
half
the
allowance
is
that
nice
just
now
when
the
girls
are
grown
up
and
are
going
out
into
life
we
must
look
into
this
he
be
here
in
a
few
days
do
you
know
that
you
have
the
law
on
your
side
and
that
the
courts
can
force
him
to
pay
and
he
shall
be
forced
to
do
so
do
you
understand
so
he
can
bring
children
into
the
world
and
then
leave
them
with
the
poor
deserted
mother
who
believes
in
woman
equality
with
man
and
in
her
economic
independence
yet
delivers
herself
of
the
old
sentimental
gush
in
behalf
of
the
poor
deserted
mother
who
has
been
supported
by
her
husband
for
years
though
their
relations
had
ceased
long
before
a
distorted
picture
some
feminists
will
say
not
at
all
it
is
as
typical
as
it
was
years
ago
even
some
emancipated
women
claim
the
right
to
be
yet
demand
their
husband
support
in
fact
many
leaders
in
the
american
suffrage
movement
assure
us
that
when
women
will
make
laws
they
will
force
men
to
support
their
wives
from
the
leaders
down
to
the
simplest
devotee
the
same
attitude
prevails
namely
that
man
is
a
and
that
but
for
him
the
berthas
would
have
long
ago
become
michelangelos
beethovens
or
shakespeares
they
claim
that
the
berthas
represent
the
most
virtuous
half
of
the
race
and
that
they
have
made
up
their
minds
to
make
man
as
virtuous
as
they
are
that
such
ridiculous
extravagance
should
be
resented
by
the
axels
is
not
at
all
surprising
it
is
resented
even
by
the
more
intelligent
of
own
sex
not
because
they
are
opposed
to
the
emancipation
of
woman
but
because
they
do
not
believe
that
her
emancipation
can
ever
be
achieved
by
such
absurd
and
hysterical
notions
they
repudiate
the
idea
that
people
who
retain
the
substance
of
their
slavery
and
merely
escape
the
shadow
can
possibly
be
free
live
free
or
act
free
the
radicals
no
less
than
the
feminists
must
realize
that
a
mere
external
change
in
their
economic
and
political
status
can
not
alter
the
inherent
or
acquired
prejudices
and
superstitions
which
underlie
their
slavery
and
dependence
and
which
are
the
main
causes
of
the
antagonism
between
the
sexes
the
transition
period
is
indeed
a
most
difficult
and
perilous
stage
for
the
woman
as
well
as
for
the
man
it
requires
a
powerful
light
to
guide
us
past
the
dangerous
reefs
and
rocks
in
the
ocean
of
life
august
strindberg
is
such
a
light
sometimes
glaring
ofttimes
scorching
but
always
beneficially
illuminating
the
path
for
those
who
walk
in
darkness
for
the
blind
ones
who
would
rather
deceive
and
be
deceived
than
look
into
the
recesses
of
their
being
therefore
august
strindberg
is
not
only
the
spiritual
conscience
of
sweden
as
he
has
been
called
but
the
spiritual
conscience
of
the
whole
human
family
and
as
such
a
most
vital
revolutionary
factor
the
german
drama
hermann
sudermann
it
has
been
said
that
military
conquest
generally
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
decline
of
creative
genius
with
the
retrogression
of
culture
i
believe
this
is
not
a
mere
assertion
the
history
of
the
human
race
repeatedly
demonstrates
that
whenever
a
nation
achieved
great
military
success
it
invariably
involved
the
decline
of
art
of
literature
of
the
drama
in
short
of
culture
in
the
deepest
and
finest
sense
this
has
been
particularly
borne
out
by
germany
after
its
military
triumph
in
the
war
for
almost
twenty
years
after
that
war
the
country
of
poets
and
thinkers
remained
intellectually
a
veritable
desert
barren
of
ideas
young
germany
had
to
go
for
its
intellectual
food
to
france
daudet
maupassant
and
zola
or
to
russia
tolstoy
turgenev
and
dostoyevski
finally
also
to
ibsen
and
strindberg
nothing
thrived
in
germany
during
that
period
except
a
sickening
patriotism
and
sentimental
romanticism
perniciously
misleading
the
people
and
giving
them
no
adequate
outlook
upon
life
and
the
social
struggle
perhaps
that
accounts
for
the
popular
vogue
of
hermann
sudermann
it
may
explain
why
he
was
received
by
the
young
generation
with
open
arms
and
acclaimed
a
great
artist
it
is
not
my
intention
to
discuss
hermann
sudermann
as
an
artist
or
to
consider
him
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
technic
of
the
drama
i
intend
to
deal
with
him
as
the
first
german
dramatist
to
treat
social
topics
and
discuss
the
pressing
questions
of
the
day
from
this
point
of
view
hermann
sudermann
may
be
regarded
as
the
pioneer
of
a
new
era
in
the
german
drama
primarily
is
this
true
of
the
three
plays
honor
magda
and
the
fires
of
st
john
in
these
dramas
hermann
sudermann
while
not
delving
deeply
into
the
causes
of
the
social
conflicts
nevertheless
touches
upon
many
vital
subjects
in
honor
the
author
demolishes
the
superficial
sentimental
conception
of
honor
that
is
a
purely
external
manifestation
having
no
roots
in
the
life
the
habits
or
the
customs
of
the
people
he
exposes
the
stupidity
of
the
notion
that
because
a
man
looks
askance
at
you
or
fails
to
pay
respect
to
your
uniform
you
must
challenge
him
to
a
duel
and
shoot
him
dead
in
this
play
sudermann
shows
that
the
conception
of
honor
is
nothing
fixed
or
permanent
but
that
it
varies
with
economic
and
social
status
different
races
peoples
and
times
holding
different
ideas
of
it
with
honor
sudermann
succeeded
in
undermining
to
a
considerable
extent
the
stupid
and
ridiculous
notion
of
the
germans
ruled
by
the
rod
and
the
kaiser
coat
but
i
particularly
wish
to
consider
magda
because
of
all
the
plays
written
by
hermann
sudermann
it
is
the
most
revolutionary
and
the
least
national
it
deals
with
a
universal
subject
the
awakening
of
woman
it
is
revolutionary
not
because
sudermann
was
the
first
to
treat
this
subject
for
ibsen
had
preceded
him
but
because
in
magda
he
was
the
first
to
raise
the
question
of
woman
right
to
motherhood
with
or
without
the
sanction
of
state
and
church
magda
lieutenant
colonel
schwartze
father
represents
all
the
conventional
and
conservative
notions
of
society
modern
ideas
oh
pshaw
i
know
them
but
come
into
the
quiet
homes
where
are
bred
brave
soldiers
and
virtuous
wives
there
you
hear
no
talk
about
heredity
no
arguments
about
individuality
no
scandalous
gossip
there
modern
ideas
have
no
foothold
for
it
is
there
that
the
life
and
strength
of
the
fatherland
abide
look
at
this
home
there
is
no
luxury
hardly
even
what
you
call
good
taste
faded
rugs
birchen
chairs
old
pictures
and
yet
when
you
see
the
beams
of
the
western
sun
pour
through
the
white
curtains
and
lie
with
such
a
loving
touch
on
the
old
room
does
not
something
say
to
you
here
dwells
true
happiness
the
is
a
rigid
military
man
he
is
utterly
blind
to
the
modern
conception
of
woman
place
in
life
he
rules
his
family
as
the
kaiser
rules
the
nation
with
severe
discipline
with
terrorism
and
despotism
he
chooses
the
man
whom
is
to
marry
and
when
she
refuses
to
accept
his
choice
he
drives
her
out
of
the
house
at
the
age
of
eighteen
goes
out
into
the
world
yearning
for
development
she
longs
for
artistic
expression
and
economic
independence
seventeen
years
later
she
returns
to
her
native
town
a
celebrated
singer
as
she
is
invited
to
sing
at
the
town
charity
bazaar
and
is
acclaimed
after
the
performance
one
of
the
greatest
stars
of
the
country
has
not
forgotten
her
home
especially
does
she
long
to
see
her
father
whom
she
loves
passionately
and
her
sister
whom
she
had
left
a
little
child
of
eight
after
the
concert
the
renowned
artist
steals
away
from
her
admirers
with
their
flowers
and
presents
and
goes
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
to
catch
a
glimpse
through
the
window
at
least
of
her
father
and
her
little
sister
father
is
scandalized
at
her
mode
of
life
what
will
people
say
if
the
daughter
of
the
distinguished
officer
stops
at
a
hotel
associates
with
men
without
a
chaperon
and
is
wined
and
dined
away
from
her
home
is
finally
prevailed
upon
to
remain
with
her
parents
she
consents
on
condition
that
they
should
not
pry
into
her
life
that
they
should
not
soil
and
besmirch
her
innermost
being
but
that
is
expecting
the
impossible
from
a
provincial
environment
it
is
not
that
her
people
really
question
but
they
insinuate
they
speak
with
looks
and
nods
burning
curiosity
to
unearth
life
is
in
the
very
air
i
implore
you
come
here
my
child
nearer
so
i
implore
you
let
me
be
happy
in
my
dying
hour
tell
me
that
you
have
remained
pure
in
body
and
soul
and
then
go
with
my
blessing
on
your
way
i
have
remained
true
to
myself
dear
father
how
in
good
or
in
ill
in
what
for
me
was
good
i
love
you
with
my
whole
heart
because
i
have
sorrowed
for
you
so
long
but
i
must
know
who
you
are
among
the
townspeople
who
come
to
pay
homage
to
is
von
in
his
student
days
he
belonged
to
the
bohemian
set
and
was
full
of
advanced
ideas
at
that
period
he
met
young
beautiful
and
inexperienced
a
love
affair
developed
but
when
finished
his
studies
he
went
home
to
the
fold
of
his
family
and
forgot
his
sweetheart
in
due
course
he
became
an
important
pillar
of
society
a
very
influential
citizen
admired
respected
and
feared
in
the
community
when
returns
home
comes
to
pay
her
his
respects
but
she
is
no
longer
the
insignificant
little
girl
he
had
known
she
is
now
a
celebrity
what
pillar
of
society
is
averse
to
basking
in
the
glow
of
celebrities
offers
flowers
and
admiration
but
discovers
in
him
the
man
who
had
robbed
her
of
her
faith
and
trust
the
father
of
her
child
has
become
purified
by
her
bitter
struggle
it
made
her
finer
and
bigger
she
does
not
even
reproach
the
man
because
i
painted
this
meeting
to
myself
a
thousand
times
and
have
been
prepared
for
it
for
years
something
warned
me
too
when
i
undertook
this
journey
home
though
i
must
say
i
hardly
expected
just
here
to
yes
how
is
it
that
after
what
has
passed
between
us
you
came
into
this
house
it
seems
to
me
a
little
i
can
see
it
all
the
effort
to
keep
worthy
of
respect
under
such
difficulties
with
a
bad
conscience
is
awkward
you
look
down
from
the
height
of
your
pure
atmosphere
on
your
sinful
youth
for
you
are
called
a
pillar
my
dear
friend
well
i
felt
myself
called
to
higher
things
i
thought
why
should
i
undervalue
my
position
i
have
become
councillor
and
that
comparatively
young
an
ordinary
ambition
might
take
satisfaction
in
that
but
one
sits
and
waits
at
home
while
others
are
called
to
the
ministry
and
this
environment
conventionality
and
narrowness
all
is
so
gray
gray
and
the
ladies
here
for
one
who
cares
at
all
about
elegance
i
assure
you
something
rejoiced
within
me
when
i
read
this
morning
that
you
were
the
famous
singer
you
to
whom
i
was
tied
by
so
many
dear
memories
and
and
then
you
thought
whether
it
might
not
be
possible
with
the
help
of
these
dear
memories
to
bring
a
little
color
into
the
gray
background
oh
pray
do
well
between
old
friends
really
are
we
that
really
certainly
oh
if
i
took
it
from
the
other
standpoint
i
should
have
to
range
the
whole
gamut
liar
coward
traitor
but
as
i
look
at
it
i
owe
you
nothing
but
thanks
my
friend
this
is
a
view
which
which
is
very
convenient
for
you
but
why
should
i
not
make
it
convenient
for
you
in
the
manner
in
which
we
met
you
had
no
obligations
towards
me
i
had
left
my
home
i
was
young
and
innocent
and
careless
and
i
lived
as
i
saw
others
live
i
gave
myself
to
you
because
i
loved
you
i
might
perhaps
have
loved
anyone
who
came
in
my
way
that
that
seemed
to
be
all
over
and
we
were
so
happy
were
we
yes
we
were
a
merry
set
and
when
the
fun
had
lasted
half
a
year
one
day
my
lover
vanished
an
unlucky
chance
i
swear
to
you
my
father
was
ill
i
had
to
travel
i
wrote
everything
to
you
h
i
did
reproach
you
and
now
i
will
tell
you
why
i
owe
you
thanks
i
was
a
stupid
unsuspecting
thing
enjoying
freedom
like
a
runaway
monkey
through
you
i
became
a
woman
for
whatever
i
have
done
in
my
art
for
whatever
i
have
become
in
myself
i
have
you
to
thank
my
soul
was
like
yes
down
below
there
there
used
to
be
an
Ã¦olian
harp
which
was
left
moldering
because
my
father
could
not
bear
it
such
a
silent
harp
was
my
soul
and
through
you
it
was
given
to
the
storm
and
it
sounded
almost
to
breaking
the
whole
scale
of
passions
which
bring
us
women
to
maturity
love
and
hate
and
revenge
and
ambition
and
need
need
need
three
times
need
and
the
highest
the
strongest
the
holiest
of
all
the
mother
love
all
i
owe
to
you
my
child
your
child
who
calls
it
so
yours
ha
ha
dare
to
claim
portion
in
him
and
i
kill
you
with
these
hands
who
are
you
you
a
strange
man
who
gratified
his
lust
and
passed
on
with
a
laugh
but
i
have
a
child
my
son
my
god
my
all
for
him
i
lived
and
starved
and
froze
and
walked
the
streets
for
him
i
sang
and
danced
in
for
my
child
who
was
crying
for
his
bread
for
heaven
sake
hush
someone
coming
let
them
come
let
them
all
come
i
do
care
i
care
to
their
faces
i
say
what
i
think
of
you
of
you
and
your
respectable
society
why
should
i
be
worse
than
you
that
i
must
prolong
my
existence
among
you
by
a
lie
why
should
this
gold
upon
my
body
and
the
lustre
which
surrounds
my
name
only
increase
my
infamy
have
i
not
worked
early
and
late
for
ten
long
years
have
i
not
woven
this
dress
with
sleepless
nights
have
i
not
built
up
my
career
step
by
step
like
thousands
of
my
kind
why
should
i
blush
before
anyone
i
am
myself
and
through
myself
i
have
become
what
i
am
father
learns
about
the
affair
and
immediately
demands
that
the
marry
his
daughter
or
fight
a
duel
resents
the
preposterous
idea
is
indeed
glad
to
offer
his
hand
in
marriage
she
is
so
beautiful
and
fascinating
she
will
prove
a
great
asset
to
his
ambitions
but
he
stipulates
that
she
give
up
her
profession
of
singer
and
that
the
existence
of
the
child
be
kept
secret
he
tells
that
later
on
when
they
are
happily
married
and
firmly
established
in
the
world
they
will
bring
their
child
to
their
home
and
adopt
it
but
for
the
present
respectability
must
not
know
that
it
is
theirs
born
out
of
wedlock
without
the
sanction
of
the
church
and
the
state
that
is
more
than
can
endure
she
is
outraged
that
she
the
mother
who
had
given
up
everything
for
the
sake
of
her
child
who
had
slaved
struggled
and
drudged
in
order
to
win
a
career
and
economic
independence
all
for
the
sake
of
the
child
that
she
should
forswear
her
right
to
motherhood
her
right
to
be
true
to
herself
what
what
do
you
say
why
it
would
ruin
us
no
no
it
is
absurd
to
think
of
it
but
we
can
make
a
little
journey
every
year
to
wherever
it
is
being
educated
one
can
register
under
a
false
name
that
is
not
unusual
in
foreign
parts
and
is
hardly
criminal
and
when
we
are
fifty
years
old
and
other
regular
conditions
have
been
fulfilled
that
can
be
arranged
ca
it
then
we
can
under
some
pretext
adopt
it
ca
we
i
have
humbled
myself
i
have
surrendered
my
judgment
i
have
let
myself
be
carried
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
but
my
child
i
will
not
leave
give
up
my
child
to
save
his
career
orders
out
of
the
house
but
the
old
is
unbending
he
insists
that
his
daughter
become
an
honorable
woman
by
marrying
the
man
who
had
seduced
her
her
refusal
fires
his
wrath
to
wild
rage
either
you
swear
to
me
now
that
you
will
become
the
honorable
wife
of
your
child
father
or
neither
of
us
two
shall
go
out
of
this
room
alive
you
think
because
you
are
free
and
a
great
artist
that
you
can
set
at
naught
leave
art
out
of
the
question
consider
me
nothing
more
than
the
seamstress
or
the
who
seeks
among
strangers
the
little
food
and
the
little
love
she
needs
see
how
much
the
family
with
its
morality
demand
from
us
it
throws
us
on
our
own
resources
it
gives
us
neither
shelter
nor
happiness
and
yet
in
our
loneliness
we
must
live
according
to
the
laws
which
it
has
planned
for
itself
alone
we
must
still
crouch
in
the
corner
and
there
wait
patiently
until
a
respectful
wooer
happens
to
come
yes
wait
and
meanwhile
the
war
for
existence
of
body
and
soul
is
consuming
us
ahead
we
see
nothing
but
sorrow
and
despair
and
yet
shall
we
not
once
dare
to
give
what
we
have
of
youth
and
strength
to
the
man
for
whom
our
whole
being
cries
gag
us
stupefy
us
shut
us
up
in
harems
or
in
cloisters
and
that
perhaps
would
be
best
but
if
you
give
us
our
freedom
do
not
wonder
if
we
take
advantage
of
it
but
morality
and
the
family
never
understand
the
magdas
least
of
all
does
the
old
colonel
understand
his
daughter
rigid
in
his
false
notions
and
superstitions
wrought
up
with
distress
he
is
about
to
carry
out
his
threat
when
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
overtakes
him
in
magda
hermann
sudermann
has
given
to
the
world
a
new
picture
of
modern
womanhood
a
type
of
free
motherhood
as
such
the
play
is
of
great
revolutionary
significance
not
alone
to
germany
but
to
the
universal
spirit
of
a
newer
day
the
fires
of
john
in
the
fires
of
john
sudermann
does
not
go
as
far
as
in
magda
nevertheless
the
play
deals
with
important
truths
life
does
not
always
draw
the
same
conclusions
life
is
not
always
logical
not
always
consistent
the
function
of
the
artist
is
to
portray
life
only
thus
can
he
be
true
both
to
art
and
to
life
in
this
drama
we
witness
the
bondage
of
gratitude
one
of
the
most
enslaving
and
paralyzing
factors
a
landed
proprietor
has
a
child
a
beautiful
girl
who
has
always
lived
the
sheltered
life
of
a
plant
the
brauers
also
have
an
adopted
daughter
whom
they
had
picked
up
on
the
road
while
traveling
on
a
stormy
night
they
called
her
the
calamity
child
because
a
great
misfortune
had
befallen
them
shortly
before
younger
brother
confronted
with
heavy
losses
had
shot
himself
leaving
behind
his
son
and
a
heavily
mortgaged
estate
the
finding
of
the
baby
under
these
circumstances
was
considered
by
the
brauers
an
omen
they
adopted
it
and
brought
it
up
as
their
own
this
involved
the
forcible
separation
of
from
her
gypsy
mother
who
was
a
pariah
an
outcast
beggar
she
drank
and
stole
in
order
to
subsist
but
with
it
all
her
mother
instinct
was
strong
and
it
always
drove
her
back
to
the
place
where
her
child
lived
had
her
first
shock
when
on
her
way
home
from
confirmation
the
ragged
and
brutalized
woman
threw
herself
before
the
young
girl
crying
mamie
my
child
my
mamie
it
was
then
that
realized
her
origin
out
of
gratitude
she
consecrated
her
life
to
the
brauers
never
forgot
for
a
moment
that
she
owed
everything
her
education
her
support
and
happiness
to
her
adopted
parents
she
wrapped
herself
around
them
with
all
the
intensity
and
passion
of
her
nature
she
became
the
very
spirit
of
the
house
she
looked
after
the
estate
and
devoted
herself
to
little
as
to
her
own
sister
is
engaged
to
marry
her
cousin
and
everything
is
beautiful
and
joyous
in
the
household
no
one
suspects
that
has
been
in
love
with
the
young
man
ever
since
her
childhood
however
because
of
her
gratitude
to
her
benefactors
she
stifles
her
nature
hardens
her
heart
and
locks
her
feelings
behind
closed
doors
as
it
were
and
when
is
about
to
marry
throws
herself
into
the
work
of
fixing
up
a
home
for
the
young
people
to
surround
them
with
sunshine
and
joy
in
their
new
love
life
accidentally
discovers
a
manuscript
written
by
wherein
he
discloses
his
deep
love
for
her
she
learns
that
he
even
as
she
has
no
other
thought
no
other
purpose
in
life
than
his
love
for
her
but
he
also
is
bound
by
gratitude
for
his
uncle
who
had
saved
the
honor
of
his
father
and
had
rescued
him
from
poverty
he
feels
it
dishonorable
to
refuse
to
marry
all
these
years
i
have
struggled
and
deprived
myself
with
only
one
thing
in
view
to
be
free
free
and
yet
i
must
bow
i
must
bow
if
it
were
not
for
the
sake
of
this
beautiful
child
who
is
innocent
of
it
all
i
would
be
tempted
to
but
the
die
is
cast
the
yoke
is
ready
and
so
am
i
i
too
am
a
child
of
misery
a
calamity
child
but
i
am
a
subject
of
charity
i
accept
all
they
have
to
give
was
i
not
picked
up
from
the
street
as
my
uncle
so
kindly
informed
me
for
the
second
time
like
yourself
do
i
not
belong
to
this
house
and
am
i
not
smothered
with
the
damnable
charity
of
my
benefactors
like
yourself
it
is
john
night
the
entire
family
is
gathered
on
the
estate
of
the
brauers
while
the
peasants
are
making
merry
with
song
and
dance
at
the
lighted
bonfires
it
is
a
glorious
dreamy
night
suggestive
of
symbolic
meaning
according
to
the
servant
it
is
written
that
whoever
shall
give
or
receive
their
first
kiss
on
john
eve
their
love
is
sealed
and
they
will
be
faithful
unto
death
in
the
opinion
of
the
john
night
represents
a
religious
phase
too
holy
for
flippant
pagan
joy
on
such
a
dreamy
night
different
emotions
are
aroused
within
us
we
seem
to
be
able
to
look
into
the
future
and
imagine
ourselves
able
to
fathom
all
mystery
and
heal
all
wounds
the
common
becomes
elevated
our
wishes
become
fate
and
now
we
ask
ourselves
what
is
it
that
causes
all
this
within
us
all
these
desires
and
wishes
it
is
brotherly
love
that
has
been
planted
in
our
souls
that
fills
our
lives
and
it
is
life
itself
am
i
not
right
and
now
with
one
bound
i
will
come
to
the
point
in
the
revelation
you
will
find
god
is
love
yes
god
is
love
and
that
is
the
most
beautiful
trait
of
our
religion
that
the
best
the
most
beautiful
within
us
has
been
granted
us
by
him
above
then
how
could
i
this
very
evening
so
overcome
with
feeling
for
my
how
could
i
pass
him
by
therefore
brauer
no
matter
whether
pastor
or
layman
i
must
confess
my
inability
to
grant
your
wish
and
decline
to
give
you
a
genuine
pagan
toast
but
christian
symbolism
having
mostly
descended
from
primitive
pagan
custom
view
is
perhaps
the
most
significant
since
the
pastor
has
so
eloquently
withdrawn
i
will
give
you
a
toast
for
you
see
my
dear
pastor
something
of
the
old
pagan
a
spark
of
heathenism
is
still
glowing
somewhere
within
us
all
it
has
outlived
century
after
century
from
the
time
of
the
old
teutons
once
every
year
that
spark
is
fanned
into
flame
it
flames
up
high
and
then
it
is
called
the
fires
of
st
john
once
every
year
we
have
free
night
then
the
witches
ride
upon
their
brooms
the
same
brooms
with
which
their
witchcraft
was
once
driven
out
of
them
with
scornful
laughter
the
wild
hordes
sweep
across
the
up
up
high
upon
the
blocksberg
then
it
is
when
in
our
hearts
awake
those
wild
desires
which
our
fates
could
not
fulfill
and
understand
me
well
dared
not
fulfill
then
no
matter
what
may
be
the
name
of
the
law
that
governs
the
world
on
that
day
in
order
that
one
single
wish
may
become
a
reality
by
whose
grace
we
prolong
our
miserable
existence
thousand
others
must
miserably
perish
part
because
they
were
never
attainable
but
the
others
yes
the
others
because
we
allowed
them
to
escape
us
like
wild
birds
which
though
already
in
our
hands
but
too
listless
to
profit
by
opportunity
we
failed
to
grasp
at
the
right
moment
but
no
matter
once
every
year
we
have
free
night
and
yonder
tongues
of
fire
shooting
up
towards
the
heavens
do
you
know
what
they
are
they
are
the
spirits
of
our
dead
perished
wishes
that
is
the
red
plumage
of
our
birds
of
paradise
we
might
have
petted
and
nursed
through
our
entire
lives
but
have
escaped
us
that
is
the
old
chaos
the
heathenism
within
us
and
though
we
be
happy
in
sunshine
and
according
to
law
is
john
night
to
its
ancient
pagan
fires
i
empty
this
glass
they
shall
burn
and
flame
up
high
high
and
again
high
and
meet
they
too
have
had
their
instinct
locked
away
even
from
their
own
consciousness
and
on
this
night
they
break
loose
with
tremendous
primitive
force
they
are
driven
into
each
other
arms
because
they
feel
that
they
belong
to
each
other
they
know
that
if
they
had
the
strength
they
could
take
each
other
by
the
hand
face
their
benefactor
and
tell
him
the
truth
tell
him
that
it
would
be
an
unpardonable
crime
for
to
marry
when
he
loves
another
woman
now
they
all
but
find
courage
and
strength
for
it
when
the
pitiful
plaint
reaches
them
oh
mine
mamie
mine
daughter
mine
child
and
is
cast
down
from
the
sublime
height
of
her
love
and
passion
down
to
the
realization
that
she
also
like
her
pariah
mother
must
go
out
into
the
world
to
struggle
to
fight
to
become
free
from
the
bondage
of
gratitude
of
charity
and
dependence
not
so
he
goes
to
the
altar
like
many
another
man
with
a
lie
upon
his
lips
he
goes
to
swear
that
all
his
life
long
he
will
love
protect
and
shelter
the
woman
who
is
to
be
his
wife
this
play
is
rich
in
thought
and
revolutionary
significance
for
is
it
not
true
that
we
are
all
bound
by
gratitude
tied
and
fettered
by
what
we
think
we
owe
to
others
are
we
not
thus
turned
into
weaklings
and
cowards
and
do
we
not
enter
into
new
relationships
with
lies
upon
our
lips
do
we
not
become
a
lie
to
ourselves
and
a
lie
to
those
we
associate
with
and
whether
we
have
the
strength
to
be
true
to
the
dominant
spirit
warmed
into
being
by
the
fires
of
john
whether
we
have
the
courage
to
live
up
to
it
always
or
whether
it
manifests
itself
only
on
occasion
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
there
is
the
potentiality
of
freedom
in
the
soul
of
every
man
and
every
woman
that
there
is
the
possibility
of
greatness
and
fineness
in
all
beings
were
they
not
bound
and
gagged
by
gratitude
by
duty
and
shams
a
vicious
network
that
enmeshes
body
and
soul
gerhart
hauptmann
lonely
lives
gerhart
hauptmann
is
the
dramatist
of
whom
it
may
be
justly
said
that
he
revolutionized
the
spirit
of
dramatic
art
in
germany
the
last
mohican
of
a
group
of
four
ibsen
strindberg
tolstoy
and
hauptmann
who
illumined
the
horizon
of
the
nineteenth
century
of
these
hauptmann
undoubtedly
the
most
human
is
also
the
most
universal
it
is
unnecessary
to
make
comparisons
between
great
artists
life
is
sufficiently
complex
to
give
each
his
place
in
the
great
scheme
of
things
if
then
i
consider
hauptmann
more
human
it
is
because
of
his
deep
kinship
with
every
stratum
of
life
while
ibsen
deals
exclusively
with
attitude
hauptmann
embraces
all
understands
all
and
portrays
all
because
nothing
human
is
alien
to
him
whether
it
be
the
struggle
of
the
transition
stage
in
lonely
lives
or
the
conflict
between
the
ideal
and
the
real
in
the
sunken
bell
or
the
brutal
background
of
poverty
in
the
weavers
hauptmann
is
never
aloof
as
the
iconoclast
ibsen
never
as
bitter
as
the
soul
dissector
strindberg
nor
yet
as
set
as
the
crusader
tolstoy
and
that
because
of
his
humanity
his
boundless
love
his
oneness
with
the
disinherited
of
the
earth
and
his
sympathy
with
the
struggles
and
the
travail
the
hope
and
the
despair
of
every
human
soul
that
accounts
for
the
bitter
opposition
which
met
gerhart
hauptmann
when
he
made
his
first
appearance
as
a
dramatist
but
it
also
accounts
for
the
love
and
devotion
of
those
to
whom
he
was
a
battle
cry
a
clarion
call
against
all
iniquity
injustice
and
wrong
in
lonely
lives
we
see
the
wonderful
sympathy
the
tenderness
of
hauptmann
permeating
every
figure
of
the
drama
is
not
a
fighter
not
a
propagandist
or
a
soapbox
orator
he
is
a
dreamer
a
poet
and
above
all
a
searcher
for
truth
a
scientist
a
man
who
lives
in
the
realm
of
thought
and
ideas
and
is
out
of
touch
with
reality
and
his
immediate
surroundings
his
parents
are
simple
folk
religious
and
devoted
to
them
the
world
is
a
book
with
seven
seals
having
lived
all
their
life
on
a
farm
everything
with
them
is
regulated
and
classified
into
simple
ideas
good
or
bad
great
or
small
strong
or
weak
how
can
they
know
the
infinite
shades
between
strong
and
weak
how
could
they
grasp
the
endless
variations
between
the
good
and
the
bad
to
them
life
is
a
daily
routine
of
work
and
prayer
god
has
arranged
everything
and
god
manages
everything
why
bother
your
head
why
spend
sleepless
nights
leave
it
all
to
god
what
pathos
in
this
childish
simplicity
they
love
their
son
they
worship
him
and
they
consecrate
their
lives
to
their
only
boy
and
because
of
their
love
for
him
also
to
his
wife
and
the
newly
born
baby
they
have
but
one
sorrow
their
son
has
turned
away
from
religion
still
greater
their
grief
that
is
an
admirer
of
darwin
spencer
and
haeckel
and
other
such
men
sinners
heathens
all
who
will
burn
in
purgatory
and
hell
to
protect
their
beloved
son
from
the
punishment
of
god
the
old
folks
continuously
pray
and
give
still
more
devotion
and
love
to
their
erring
child
wife
is
a
beautiful
type
of
the
gretchen
reared
without
any
ideas
about
life
without
any
consciousness
of
her
position
in
the
world
a
tender
helpless
flower
she
loves
he
is
her
ideal
he
is
her
all
but
she
can
not
understand
him
she
does
not
live
in
his
sphere
nor
speak
his
language
she
has
never
dreamed
his
thoughts
not
because
she
is
not
willing
or
not
eager
to
give
the
man
all
that
he
needs
but
because
she
does
not
understand
and
does
not
know
how
into
this
atmosphere
comes
like
a
breeze
from
the
plains
is
a
russian
girl
a
woman
so
far
produced
in
russia
only
perhaps
because
the
conditions
the
life
struggles
of
that
country
have
been
such
as
to
develop
a
different
type
of
woman
has
spent
most
of
her
life
on
the
firing
line
she
has
no
conception
of
the
personal
she
is
universal
in
her
feelings
and
thoughts
with
deep
sympathies
going
out
in
abundance
to
all
mankind
when
she
comes
to
the
vockerats
their
whole
life
is
disturbed
especially
that
of
to
whom
she
is
like
a
balmy
spring
to
the
parched
wanderer
in
the
desert
she
understands
him
for
has
she
not
dreamed
such
thoughts
as
his
associated
with
men
and
women
who
for
the
sake
of
the
ideal
sacrificed
their
lives
went
to
siberia
and
suffered
in
the
underground
dungeons
how
then
could
she
fail
a
vockerat
it
is
quite
natural
that
should
find
in
what
his
own
little
world
could
not
give
him
understanding
comradeship
deep
spiritual
kinship
the
anna
mahrs
give
the
same
to
any
one
be
it
man
woman
or
child
for
theirs
is
not
a
feeling
of
sex
of
the
personal
it
is
the
selfless
the
human
the
fellowship
in
the
invigorating
presence
of
begins
to
live
to
dream
and
work
another
phase
of
him
as
it
were
comes
into
being
larger
vistas
open
before
his
eyes
and
his
life
is
filled
with
new
aspiration
for
creative
work
in
behalf
of
a
liberating
purpose
alas
the
inevitability
that
the
ideal
should
be
besmirched
and
desecrated
when
it
comes
in
contact
with
sordid
reality
this
tragic
fate
befalls
and
old
who
in
her
simplicity
of
soul
can
not
conceive
of
an
intimate
friendship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
unless
they
be
husband
and
wife
begins
first
to
suspect
and
insinuate
then
to
nag
and
interfere
of
course
it
is
her
love
for
and
even
more
so
her
love
for
her
son
wife
who
is
suffering
in
silence
and
wearing
out
her
soul
in
her
realization
of
how
little
she
can
mean
to
her
husband
interprets
grief
in
a
different
manner
jealousy
and
antagonism
to
the
successful
rival
is
her
most
convenient
explanation
for
the
loneliness
the
of
love
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
something
deeper
and
more
vital
that
is
born
in
soul
it
is
the
awakening
of
her
own
womanhood
of
her
personality
i
agree
with
miss
mahr
on
many
points
she
was
saying
lately
that
we
women
live
in
a
condition
of
degradation
i
think
she
is
quite
right
there
it
is
what
i
feel
very
often
it
as
clear
as
daylight
that
she
is
right
we
are
really
and
truly
a
despised
and
sex
only
think
that
there
is
still
a
law
so
she
told
me
yesterday
which
allows
the
husband
to
inflict
a
moderate
amount
of
corporal
punishment
on
his
wife
and
yet
corporal
punishment
is
not
half
as
terrible
as
the
punishment
society
inflicts
on
the
kittys
by
rearing
them
as
dependent
and
useless
beings
as
flowers
ornaments
for
a
fine
house
but
of
no
substance
to
the
husband
and
certainly
of
less
to
her
children
and
without
any
viciousness
instills
poison
into
the
innocent
soul
of
and
embitters
the
life
of
her
loved
son
ignorantly
meddles
interferes
and
tramples
upon
the
most
sacred
feelings
the
innocent
joys
of
true
comradeship
and
all
the
time
and
are
quite
unaware
of
the
pain
and
tragedy
they
are
the
cause
of
they
are
far
removed
from
the
commonplace
petty
world
about
them
they
walk
and
discuss
read
and
argue
about
the
wonders
of
life
the
needs
of
humanity
the
beauty
of
the
ideal
they
have
both
been
famished
so
long
for
spiritual
communion
for
warmth
of
home
that
she
had
known
so
little
before
and
which
in
her
simplicity
she
has
accepted
at
the
hand
of
and
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
nothing
is
so
enslaving
as
hospitality
prompted
by
a
sense
of
duty
it
is
a
great
age
that
we
live
in
that
which
has
so
weighed
upon
people
minds
and
darkened
their
lives
seems
to
me
to
be
gradually
disappearing
do
you
not
think
so
vockerat
how
do
you
mean
on
the
one
hand
we
were
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
uncertainty
of
apprehension
on
the
other
by
gloomy
fanaticism
this
exaggerated
tension
is
calming
down
is
yielding
to
the
influence
of
something
like
a
current
of
fresh
air
that
is
blowing
in
upon
us
from
let
us
say
from
the
twentieth
century
but
i
do
find
it
possible
to
arrive
at
any
real
joy
in
life
yet
i
do
know
it
has
no
connection
with
our
individual
fates
our
little
fates
dr
vockerat
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
but
you
are
not
to
get
angry
you
are
to
be
quite
quiet
and
good
vockerat
we
also
are
falling
into
the
error
of
weak
natures
we
must
look
at
things
more
impersonally
we
must
learn
to
take
ourselves
less
seriously
but
we
not
talk
about
that
at
present
and
is
one
really
to
sacrifice
everything
that
one
has
gained
to
this
cursed
conventionality
are
people
incapable
of
understanding
that
there
can
be
no
crime
in
a
situation
which
only
tends
to
make
both
parties
better
and
nobler
do
parents
lose
by
their
son
becoming
a
better
wiser
man
does
a
wife
lose
by
the
spiritual
growth
of
her
husband
you
are
both
right
and
wrong
your
parents
have
a
different
standard
from
you
kitty
again
differs
from
theirs
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
we
can
not
judge
for
them
yes
but
you
have
always
said
yourself
that
one
should
not
allow
one
self
to
be
ruled
by
the
opinion
of
others
that
one
ought
to
be
independent
you
have
often
said
to
me
that
you
foresee
a
new
a
nobler
state
of
fellowship
between
man
and
woman
yes
i
feel
that
it
will
come
some
time
a
relationship
in
which
the
human
will
preponderate
over
the
animal
tie
animal
will
no
longer
be
united
to
animal
but
one
human
being
to
another
friendship
is
the
foundation
on
which
this
love
will
rise
beautiful
unchangeable
a
miraculous
structure
and
i
foresee
more
than
this
something
nobler
richer
freer
still
but
will
you
get
anyone
except
me
to
believe
this
will
this
prevent
kitty
grieving
herself
to
death
do
let
us
speak
of
ourselves
at
all
let
us
suppose
quite
generally
the
feeling
of
a
new
more
perfect
relationship
between
two
people
to
exist
as
it
were
prophetically
it
is
only
a
feeling
a
young
and
all
too
tender
plant
which
must
be
carefully
watched
and
guarded
do
you
think
so
vockerat
that
this
plant
should
come
to
perfection
during
our
lifetime
is
not
to
be
expected
we
shall
not
see
or
taste
its
fruits
but
we
may
help
to
propagate
it
for
future
generations
i
could
imagine
a
person
accepting
this
as
a
and
hence
you
conclude
that
we
must
part
i
did
not
mean
to
speak
of
ourselves
but
it
is
as
you
say
we
must
part
another
idea
had
sometimes
suggested
itself
to
me
too
momentarily
but
i
could
not
entertain
it
now
i
too
have
felt
as
if
it
were
the
presentiment
of
better
things
and
since
then
the
old
aim
seems
to
me
too
poor
a
one
for
us
too
common
to
tell
the
truth
it
is
like
coming
down
from
the
with
its
wide
free
view
and
feeling
the
narrowness
the
nearness
of
everything
in
the
valley
those
who
feel
the
narrow
stifling
atmosphere
must
either
die
or
leave
is
not
made
for
the
valley
she
must
live
on
the
heights
but
harassed
and
whipped
on
by
those
who
love
him
most
is
unmanned
broken
and
crushed
he
clings
to
as
one
condemned
to
death
help
me
miss
anna
there
is
no
manliness
no
pride
left
in
me
i
am
quite
changed
at
this
moment
i
am
not
even
the
man
i
was
before
you
came
to
us
the
one
feeling
left
in
me
is
disgust
and
weariness
of
life
everything
has
lost
its
worth
to
me
is
soiled
polluted
desecrated
dragged
through
the
mire
when
i
think
what
you
your
presence
your
words
made
me
i
feel
that
if
i
can
not
be
that
again
then
then
all
the
rest
no
longer
means
anything
to
me
i
draw
a
line
through
it
all
and
my
it
grieves
me
terribly
vockerat
to
see
you
like
this
i
hardly
know
how
i
am
to
help
you
but
one
thing
you
ought
to
remember
that
we
foresaw
this
we
knew
that
we
must
be
prepared
for
this
sooner
or
later
our
prophetic
feeling
of
a
new
a
free
existence
a
state
of
blessedness
that
feeling
we
will
keep
it
shall
never
be
forgotten
though
it
may
never
be
realized
it
shall
be
my
guiding
light
when
this
light
is
extinguished
my
life
will
be
extinguished
too
john
one
word
more
this
ring
was
taken
from
the
finger
of
a
dead
woman
who
had
followed
her
her
husband
to
siberia
and
faithfully
shared
his
suffering
to
the
end
just
the
opposite
to
our
case
it
is
the
only
ring
i
have
ever
worn
its
story
is
a
thing
to
think
of
when
one
feels
weak
and
when
you
look
at
it
in
hours
of
weakness
then
think
of
her
who
far
away
lonely
like
yourself
is
fighting
the
same
secret
fight
but
john
lacks
the
strength
for
the
fight
life
to
him
is
too
lonely
too
empty
too
unbearably
desolate
he
has
to
die
a
suicide
what
wonderful
grasp
of
the
deepest
and
most
hidden
tones
of
the
human
soul
what
significance
in
the
bitter
truth
that
those
who
struggle
for
an
ideal
those
who
attempt
to
cut
themselves
loose
from
the
old
from
the
thousand
fetters
that
hold
them
down
are
doomed
to
lonely
lives
gerhart
hauptmann
has
dedicated
this
play
to
those
who
have
lived
this
life
and
there
are
many
oh
so
many
who
must
live
this
life
torn
out
root
and
all
from
the
soil
of
their
birth
of
their
surroundings
and
past
the
ideal
they
see
only
in
the
distance
sometimes
quite
near
again
in
the
distance
these
are
the
lonely
lives
this
drama
also
emphasizes
the
important
point
that
not
only
the
parents
and
the
wife
of
fail
to
understand
him
but
even
his
own
comrade
one
of
his
own
world
the
painter
the
type
of
fanatical
revolutionist
who
scorns
human
weaknesses
and
ridicules
those
who
make
concessions
and
compromises
but
not
even
this
can
grasp
the
needs
of
referring
to
his
chum
friendship
with
upbraids
him
he
charges
with
causing
his
wife
unhappiness
and
hurting
the
feelings
of
his
parents
this
very
man
who
as
a
propagandist
demands
that
every
one
live
up
to
his
ideal
is
quick
to
condemn
his
friend
when
the
latter
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
tries
to
be
consistent
to
be
true
to
his
own
innermost
being
the
revolutionary
the
social
and
human
significance
of
lonely
lives
consists
in
the
lesson
that
the
real
revolutionist
the
dreamer
the
creative
artist
the
iconoclast
in
whatever
line
is
fated
to
be
misunderstood
not
only
by
his
own
kin
but
often
by
his
own
comrades
that
is
the
doom
of
all
great
spirits
they
are
detached
from
their
environment
theirs
is
a
lonely
life
the
life
of
the
transition
stage
the
hardest
and
the
most
difficult
period
for
the
individual
as
well
as
for
a
people
the
weavers
when
the
weavers
first
saw
the
light
pandemonium
broke
out
in
the
land
of
thinkers
and
poets
what
cried
philistia
workingmen
dirty
emaciated
and
starved
to
be
placed
on
the
stage
poverty
in
all
its
ugliness
to
be
presented
as
an
amusement
that
is
too
much
indeed
it
is
too
much
for
the
bourgeoisie
to
be
brought
face
to
face
with
the
horrors
of
the
weaver
existence
it
is
too
much
because
of
the
truth
and
reality
that
thunders
in
the
placid
ears
of
society
a
terrific
gerhart
hauptmann
is
a
child
of
the
people
his
grandfather
was
a
weaver
and
the
only
way
his
father
could
escape
the
fate
of
his
parents
was
by
leaving
his
trade
and
opening
an
inn
little
gerhart
vivid
and
impressionable
mind
must
have
received
many
pictures
from
the
stories
told
about
the
life
of
the
weavers
who
knows
but
that
the
social
panorama
which
hauptmann
subsequently
gave
to
the
world
had
not
slumbered
in
the
soul
of
the
child
gaining
form
and
substance
as
he
grew
to
manhood
at
any
rate
the
weavers
like
the
canvases
of
millet
and
the
heroic
figures
of
meunier
represent
the
epic
of
the
misery
of
labor
a
profoundly
stirring
picture
the
background
of
the
weavers
is
the
weaving
district
in
silesia
during
the
period
of
home
industry
a
gruesome
sight
of
human
phantoms
dragging
on
their
emaciated
existence
almost
by
superhuman
effort
life
is
a
tenacious
force
that
clings
desperately
even
to
the
most
meager
chance
in
an
endeavor
to
assert
itself
but
what
is
mirrored
in
the
weavers
is
so
appalling
so
dismally
hopeless
that
it
stamps
the
damning
brand
upon
our
civilization
one
man
and
his
hirelings
thrive
on
the
sinew
and
bone
on
the
very
blood
of
an
entire
community
the
manufacturer
spends
more
for
cigars
in
a
day
than
an
entire
family
earns
in
a
week
yet
so
brutalizing
so
terrible
is
the
effect
of
wealth
that
neither
pale
hunger
nor
black
despair
can
move
the
master
there
is
nothing
in
literature
to
equal
the
cruel
reality
of
the
scene
in
the
office
of
when
the
weavers
bring
the
finished
cloth
for
hours
they
are
kept
waiting
in
the
stuffy
place
waiting
the
pleasure
of
the
rich
employer
after
they
had
walked
miles
on
an
empty
stomach
and
little
sleep
for
as
one
of
the
men
says
what
to
hinder
a
weaver
waitin
for
an
hour
or
for
a
day
what
else
is
he
there
for
indeed
what
else
except
to
be
always
waiting
in
humility
to
be
exploited
and
degraded
always
at
the
mercy
of
the
few
pence
thrown
to
them
after
an
endless
wait
necessity
knows
no
law
neither
does
it
know
pride
the
weavers
driven
by
the
whip
of
hunger
bend
their
backs
beg
and
cringe
before
their
superior
no
one
ca
call
me
idle
but
i
am
not
fit
now
for
what
i
once
was
i
twice
had
a
miscarriage
as
to
john
he
but
a
poor
creature
he
been
to
the
shepherd
at
zerlau
but
he
could
do
him
no
good
and
you
ca
do
more
than
strength
for
we
works
as
hard
as
ever
we
can
this
many
a
week
i
been
at
it
till
far
into
the
night
an
we
keep
our
heads
above
water
right
enough
if
i
can
just
get
a
bit
o
strength
into
me
but
you
must
have
pity
on
us
pfeifer
sir
you
please
be
so
very
kind
as
to
let
me
have
a
few
pence
on
the
next
job
sir
only
a
few
pence
to
buy
bread
with
we
ca
get
no
more
credit
we
a
lot
o
little
ones
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
christ
loves
the
children
of
the
poor
the
more
the
better
why
then
care
if
they
starve
why
care
if
they
faint
away
with
hunger
like
the
little
boy
in
office
for
little
philip
is
one
of
nine
and
the
tenth
coming
and
the
rain
comes
through
their
roof
and
the
mother
has
two
shirts
among
the
nine
who
is
to
blame
ask
the
dreissigers
they
will
tell
you
the
poor
have
too
many
children
besides
it
was
nothing
serious
the
boy
is
all
right
again
but
all
the
same
it
a
disgrace
the
child
so
weak
that
a
puff
of
wind
would
blow
him
over
how
people
how
any
parents
can
be
so
thoughtless
is
what
passes
my
comprehension
loading
him
with
two
heavy
pieces
of
fustian
to
carry
six
good
miles
no
one
would
believe
it
that
had
seen
it
it
simply
means
that
i
shall
have
to
make
a
rule
that
no
goods
brought
by
children
will
be
taken
ever
i
sincerely
trust
that
such
things
will
not
occur
who
gets
all
the
blame
for
it
why
of
course
the
manufacturer
it
entirely
our
fault
if
some
poor
little
fellow
sticks
in
the
snow
in
winter
and
goes
to
sleep
a
special
correspondent
arrives
and
in
two
days
we
have
a
story
served
up
in
all
the
papers
is
any
blame
laid
on
the
father
the
parents
that
send
such
a
child
not
a
bit
of
it
how
should
they
be
to
blame
it
all
the
manufacturer
fault
he
made
the
scapegoat
they
flatter
the
weaver
and
give
the
manufacturer
nothing
but
abuse
he
a
cruel
man
with
a
heart
like
a
stone
a
dangerous
fellow
at
whose
calves
every
cur
of
a
journalist
may
take
a
bite
he
lives
on
the
fat
of
the
land
and
pays
the
poor
weavers
starvation
wages
in
the
flow
of
his
eloquence
the
writer
forgets
to
mention
that
such
a
man
has
his
cares
too
and
his
sleepless
nights
that
he
runs
risks
of
which
the
workman
never
dreams
that
he
is
often
driven
distracted
by
all
the
calculations
he
has
to
make
and
all
the
different
things
he
has
to
take
into
account
that
he
has
to
struggle
for
his
very
life
against
competition
and
that
no
day
passes
without
some
annoyance
or
some
loss
and
think
of
the
manufacturer
responsibilities
think
of
the
numbers
that
depend
on
him
that
look
to
him
for
their
daily
bread
no
no
none
of
you
need
wish
yourselves
in
my
shoes
you
would
soon
have
enough
of
it
you
all
saw
how
that
fellow
that
scoundrel
becker
behaved
now
he
go
and
spread
about
all
sorts
of
tales
of
my
hardheartedness
of
how
my
weavers
are
turned
off
for
a
mere
trifle
without
a
moment
notice
is
that
true
am
i
so
very
unmerciful
the
weavers
are
too
starved
too
subdued
too
not
to
accept
plea
in
his
own
behalf
what
would
become
of
these
living
corpses
were
it
not
for
the
rebels
like
to
put
fire
spirit
and
hope
in
them
verily
the
beckers
are
dangerous
appalling
as
the
scene
in
the
office
of
is
the
life
in
the
home
of
the
old
weaver
is
even
more
terrible
his
decrepit
old
wife
his
idiotic
son
who
still
has
to
wind
spools
his
two
daughters
weaving
their
youth
and
bloom
into
the
cloth
and
the
broken
remnant
of
a
heroic
type
of
man
bent
over
his
baskets
all
live
in
cramped
quarters
lit
up
only
by
two
small
windows
they
are
waiting
anxiously
for
the
few
pence
old
is
to
bring
that
they
may
indulge
in
a
meal
what
what
what
is
to
become
of
us
if
he
do
come
home
laments
there
is
not
so
much
as
a
handful
o
salt
in
the
house
not
a
bite
o
bread
nor
a
bit
o
wood
for
the
fire
but
old
has
not
forgotten
his
family
he
brings
them
a
repast
the
first
good
meal
they
have
had
in
two
years
it
is
the
meat
of
their
faithful
little
dog
whom
could
not
kill
himself
because
he
loved
him
so
but
hunger
knows
no
choice
had
his
beloved
dog
killed
because
a
nice
little
bit
o
meat
like
that
does
you
a
lot
o
good
it
did
not
do
old
much
good
his
stomach
tortured
and
abused
so
long
rebelled
and
the
old
man
had
to
give
up
the
precious
dog
and
all
this
wretchedness
all
this
horror
almost
within
sight
of
the
palatial
home
of
whose
dogs
are
better
fed
than
his
human
slaves
man
endurance
is
almost
limitless
almost
yet
not
quite
for
there
comes
a
time
when
the
even
like
their
stomachs
rise
in
rebellion
when
they
hurl
themselves
even
though
in
blind
fury
against
the
pillars
of
their
prison
house
such
a
moment
comes
to
the
weavers
the
most
patient
docile
and
subdued
of
humanity
when
stirred
to
action
by
the
powerful
poem
read
to
them
by
the
the
justice
to
us
weavers
dealt
is
bloody
cruel
and
hateful
our
life
one
torture
long
drawn
out
for
lynch
law
we
be
grateful
stretched
on
the
rack
day
after
day
heart
sick
and
bodies
aching
our
heavy
sighs
their
witness
bear
to
spirit
slowly
breaking
the
dreissigers
true
hangmen
are
servants
no
whit
behind
them
masters
and
men
with
one
accord
set
on
the
poor
to
grind
them
you
villains
all
you
brood
of
hell
you
fiends
in
fashion
human
a
curse
will
fall
on
all
like
you
who
prey
on
man
and
woman
the
suppliant
knows
he
asks
in
vain
vain
every
word
that
spoken
if
not
content
then
go
and
starve
our
rules
can
not
be
broken
then
think
of
all
our
woe
and
want
o
ye
who
hear
this
ditty
our
struggle
vain
for
daily
bread
hard
hearts
would
move
to
pity
but
pity
what
you
never
known
you
take
both
skin
and
clothing
you
cannibals
whose
cruel
deeds
fill
all
good
men
with
loathing
the
however
will
take
no
heed
arrogant
and
secure
in
the
possession
of
their
stolen
wealth
supported
by
the
mouthpieces
of
the
church
and
the
state
they
feel
safe
from
the
wrath
of
the
people
till
it
is
too
late
but
when
the
storm
breaks
they
show
the
yellow
streak
and
cravenly
run
to
cover
the
weavers
roused
at
last
by
the
poet
description
of
their
condition
urged
on
by
the
inspiring
enthusiasm
of
the
and
the
become
indifferent
to
the
threats
of
the
law
and
ignore
the
soft
tongue
of
the
dispenser
of
the
pure
word
of
god
the
god
who
provides
shelter
and
food
for
the
birds
and
clothes
the
lilies
of
the
field
too
long
they
had
believed
in
him
no
wonder
is
now
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
weavers
heretofore
so
patient
so
humble
so
easily
led
the
has
to
pay
the
price
for
his
stupidity
the
weavers
have
outgrown
even
him
the
spirit
of
revolt
sweeps
their
souls
it
gives
them
courage
and
strength
to
attack
the
rotten
structure
to
drive
the
thieves
out
of
the
temple
aye
even
to
rout
the
soldiers
who
come
to
save
the
sacred
institution
of
capitalism
the
women
too
are
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
revolt
and
become
an
avenging
force
not
even
the
devout
faith
of
who
attempts
to
stem
the
tide
with
his
blind
belief
in
his
saviour
can
stay
them
o
lord
we
know
not
how
to
be
thankful
enough
to
thee
for
that
thou
hast
spared
us
this
night
again
in
thy
goodness
an
hast
had
pity
on
us
an
hast
suffered
us
to
take
no
harm
thou
art
the
an
we
are
poor
sinful
children
of
men
that
bad
that
we
are
not
worthy
to
be
trampled
under
thy
feet
yet
thou
art
our
loving
father
an
thou
wilt
look
upon
us
accept
us
for
the
sake
of
thy
dear
son
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
jesus
blood
and
righteousness
our
covering
is
and
glorious
dress
an
if
we
sometimes
too
sore
cast
down
under
thy
chastening
when
the
fire
of
thy
purification
burns
too
hot
oh
lay
it
not
to
our
charge
forgive
us
our
sin
give
us
patience
heavenly
father
that
after
all
these
sufferin
we
may
be
made
partakers
of
thy
eternal
blessedness
amen
the
tide
is
rushing
on
own
is
part
of
the
tide
you
an
your
piety
an
religion
did
they
serve
to
keep
the
life
in
my
poor
children
in
rags
an
dirt
they
lay
all
the
four
it
did
as
much
as
keep
dry
yes
i
sets
up
to
be
a
mother
that
what
i
do
an
if
you
like
to
know
it
that
why
i
send
all
the
manufacturers
to
hell
because
i
am
a
mother
not
one
of
the
four
could
i
keep
in
life
it
was
cryin
more
than
breathin
with
me
from
the
time
each
poor
little
thing
came
into
the
world
till
death
took
pity
on
it
the
devil
a
bit
you
cared
you
sat
there
prayin
and
singin
and
let
me
run
about
till
my
feet
bled
tryin
to
get
one
little
drop
o
skim
milk
how
many
hundred
nights
has
i
lain
an
racked
my
head
to
think
what
i
could
do
to
cheat
the
churchyard
of
my
little
one
what
harm
has
a
baby
like
that
done
that
it
must
come
to
such
a
miserable
end
eh
an
over
there
at
dittrich
they
bathed
in
wine
an
washed
in
milk
no
you
may
talk
as
you
like
but
if
they
begins
here
ten
horses
wo
hold
me
back
an
what
more
if
there
a
rush
on
dittrich
you
will
see
me
in
the
forefront
of
it
an
pity
the
man
as
tries
to
prevent
me
i
stood
it
long
enough
so
now
you
know
it
thus
the
tide
sweeps
over
as
it
must
sweep
over
every
obstacle
every
hindrance
once
labor
awakens
to
the
consciousness
of
its
solidaric
power
an
epic
of
misery
and
revolt
never
before
painted
with
such
terrific
force
such
inclusive
artistry
hence
its
wide
human
appeal
its
incontrovertible
indictment
and
its
significance
not
merely
to
silesia
or
germany
but
to
our
whole
built
on
the
misery
and
exploitation
of
the
wealth
producers
of
labor
none
greater
none
more
universal
than
this
stirring
message
of
the
most
humanly
creative
genius
of
our
time
gerhart
hauptmann
the
sunken
bell
the
great
versatility
of
gerhart
hauptmann
is
perhaps
nowhere
so
apparent
as
in
the
sunken
bell
the
poetic
fairy
tale
of
the
tragedy
of
man
a
tragedy
as
rich
in
symbolism
as
it
is
realistically
true
a
tragedy
as
old
as
mankind
as
elemental
as
man
ceaseless
struggle
to
cut
loose
from
the
rock
of
ages
the
master
bell
founder
is
an
idealist
consumed
by
the
fire
of
a
great
purpose
he
has
already
set
a
hundred
bells
ringing
in
a
hundred
different
towns
all
singing
his
praises
but
his
restless
spirit
is
not
appeased
ever
it
soars
to
loftier
heights
always
yearning
to
reach
the
sun
now
once
more
he
has
tried
his
powers
and
the
new
bell
the
great
master
bell
is
raised
aloft
only
to
sink
into
the
mere
carrying
its
maker
with
it
his
old
ideals
are
broken
and
is
lost
in
the
wilderness
of
life
weak
and
faint
with
long
groping
in
the
dark
woods
and
bleeding
reaches
the
mountain
top
and
there
beholds
the
spirit
of
freedom
that
has
allured
him
on
in
the
work
which
he
strove
in
one
grand
bell
to
weld
the
silver
music
of
thy
voice
with
the
warm
gold
of
a

should
have
been
a

failed
then
wept
i
tears
of
blood
returns
to
his
faithful
wife
his
children
and
his
village
friends
to
die
the
bell
that
sank
into
the
mere
was
not
made
for
the
heights
it
was
not
fit
to
wake
the
answering
echoes
of
the
peaks
was
for
the
valley
not
the
i
choose
to
die
the
service
of
the
valleys
charms
me
no
longer
since
on
the
peak
i
stood
youth
a
new
youth
i
need
if
i
should
live
out
of
some
rare
and
magic
mountain
flower
marvelous
juices
i
should
need
to
press
and
strength
and
the
mad
lust
of
triumph
steeling
my
hand
to
work
none
yet
have
dreamed
of
the
symbol
of
youth
and
freedom
the
vision
of
new
strength
and
expression
wakes
from
his
troubled
sleep
kisses
him
back
to
life
and
inspires
him
with
faith
and
courage
to
work
toward
greater
heights
leaves
his
wife
his
hearth
his
native
place
and
rises
to
the
summit
of
his
ideal
there
to
create
to
fashion
a
marvel
bell
whose
iron
throat
shall
send
forth
the
first
waking
peal
shall
shake
the
skies
when
from
the
somber
clouds
that
weighed
upon
us
through
the
winter
night
rivers
of
jewels
shall
go
rushing
down
into
a
million
hands
outstretched
to
clutch
then
all
who
drooped
with
sudden
power
inflamed
shall
bear
their
treasure
homeward
to
their
huts
there
to
unfurl
at
last
the
silken
banners
waiting
so
long
so
long
to
be
upraised
and
now
the
wondrous
chime
again
rings
out
filling
the
air
with
such
sweet
passionate
sound
as
makes
each
breast
to
sob
with
rapturous
pain
it
sings
a
song
long
lost
and
long
forgotten
a
song
of
home
a
childlike
song
of
love
born
in
the
waters
of
some
fairy
well
known
to
all
mortals
and
yet
heard
of
none
and
as
it
rises
softly
first
and
low
the
nightingale
and
dove
seem
singing
too
and
all
the
ice
in
every
human
breast
is
melted
and
the
hate
and
pain
and
woe
stream
out
in
tears
indeed
a
wondrous
bell
as
only
those
can
forge
who
have
reached
the
mountain
top
they
who
can
soar
upon
the
wings
of
their
imagination
high
above
the
valley
of
the
commonplace
above
the
dismal
gray
of
petty
consideration
beyond
the
reach
of
the
cold
stifling
grip
of
reality
higher
ever
higher
to
kiss
the
sky
spreads
his
wings
inspired
by
the
divine
fire
of
he
all
but
reaches
the
pinnacle
but
there
is
the
ready
to
wrestle
with
the
devil
for
a
poor
human
soul
to
buy
it
free
if
need
be
to
drag
it
back
to
its
cage
that
it
may
never
rise
again
in
rebellion
to
the
will
of
god
you
shun
the
church
take
refuge
in
the
mountains
this
many
a
month
you
have
not
seen
the
home
where
your
poor
wife
sits
sighing
while
each
day
your
children
drink
their
lonely
mother
tears
for
this
there
is
no
name
but
madness
and
wicked
madness
yes
i
speak
the
truth
here
stand
i
master
overcome
with
horror
at
the
relentless
cruelty
of
your
heart
now
satan
aping
god
hath
dealt
a
blow
yes
i
must
speak
my
mind
a
blow
so
dread
that
even
he
must
marvel
at
his
triumph
now
i
have
done
too
deep
yea
to
the
neck
you
are
sunk
in
sin
your
hell
decked
out
in
beauty
as
high
heaven
shall
hold
you
fast
i
will
not
waste
more
words
yet
mark
this
master
witches
make
good
fuel
even
as
heretics
for
your
ill
deeds
heathen
and
secret
once
are
now
laid
bare
horror
they
wake
and
soon
there
shall
come
hate
then
go
your
way
farewell
my
task
is
done
the
hemlock
of
your
sin
no
man
may
hope
to
rid
your
soul
of
may
god
pity
you
but
this
remember
there
a
word
named
rue
and
some
day
some
day
as
your
dreams
you
dream
a
sudden
arrow
shot
from
out
the
blue
shall
pierce
your
breast
and
yet
you
shall
not
die
nor
shall
you
live
in
that
dread
day
you
curse
all
you
now
cherish
god
the
world
your
work
your
wretched
self
you
curse
then
think
of
me
that
bell
shall
ring
again
then
think
of
me
barely

escape
the
deadly
clutch
of
outlined
creeds
superstitions
and
conventions
embodied
in

earth
quakes
at
his
tread
and
all
the
dells
ring
with
the
echo
of
his
thunderous
blows
his
crimson
smithy
furnace
glows
and
shines
into
the
depths
of
my
most
secret
mines
what
he
is
up
to
only
satan
knows
brekekekex
hadst
thou
the
creature
slain
in
the
mere
long
since
he
had
lain
the
maker
of
the
bell
beside
the
bell
and
so
when
next
i
had
wished
to
throw
the
stones
the
bell
had
been
my
box
the
dice
his
bones
but
even
they
are
powerless
to
stem
the
tide
of
the
ideal
they
are
helpless
in
the
face
of
faith
of
his
burning
passion
to
complete
his
task
and
give
voice
to
the
golden
peal
works
and
toils
and
when
doubt
casts
its
black
shadow
athwart
his
path
charms
back
hope
she
alone
has
boundless
faith
in
her
balder
god
of
the
joy
of
life
for
he
is
part
of
her
of
the
great
glowing
force
her
spirit
breathed
into
the
heinrichs
since
time
was
born
liberty
redeemer
of
man
i
am
thy
balder
make
me
believe
it
make
me
know
it
child
give
my
faint
soul
the
rapturous
joy
it
needs
to
nerve
it
to
its
task
for
as
the
hand
toiling
with
tong
and
hammer
on
and
on
to
hew
the
marble
and
to
guide
the
chisel
now
bungles
here
now
there
yet
may
not
halt
but
enough
of
this
still
straight
and
steady
doth
the
smoke
ascend
from
my
poor
human
sacrifice
to
heaven
should
now
a
hand
on
high
reject
my
gift
why
it
may
do
so
then
the
priestly
robe
falls
from
my
shoulder
by
no
act
of
mine
while
i
who
erst
upon
the
heights
was
set
must
look
my
last
on
horeb
and
be
dumb
but
now
bring
torches
lights
and
show
thine
art
enchantress
fill
the
we
will
drink
ay
like
the
common
herd
of
mortal
men
with
resolute
hands
our
fleeting
joy
we
grip
our
unsought
leisure
we
will
fill
with
life
not
waste
it
as
the
herd
in
indolence
we
will
have
music
while
and
are
in
the
ecstasy
of
their
love
and
work
the
spirits
weave
their
treacherous
web
they
threaten
they
plead
they
cling
spirits
whose
pain
and
grief
are
harder
to
bear
than
the
enmity
or
menace
of
a
thousand
foes
spirits
that
entwine
heartstrings
with
tender
touch
yet
are
heavier
fetters
more
oppressive
than
leaden
weights
children
symbolizing
regret
that
paralyzes

creative

their
mother
tears
and
with
them
a
thousand
hands
to
pull
down
from
his
heights
back
to
the
valley
the
bell
the
bell
the
old
long
buried
bell
again
ringing
and
tolling
is
it
not
the
echo
from
the
past
the
superstitions
instilled
from
birth
the
prejudices
that
cling
to
man
with
cruel
persistence
the
conventions
which
fetter
the
wings
of
the
idealist
the
old
wrestling
with
the
new
for
the
control
of
man
the
sunken
bell
is
a
fairy
tale
in
its
poetic
beauty
and
glow
of
radiant
color
but
stripped
of
the
legendary
and
symbolic
it
is
the
life
story
of
every
seeker
for
truth
of
the
restless
spirit
of
rebellion
ever
striving
onward
ever
reaching
out
toward
the
mountain
ever
yearning
for
a
light
too
long
had
lived
in
the
valley
it
has
sapped
his
strength
has
clipped
his
wings
too
late
thy
heavy
burdens
weigh
thee
down
thy
dead
ones
are
too
mighty
for
thee
has
to
die
he
who
has
flown
so
high
into
the
very
light
as
thou
hast
flown
must
perish
if
he
once
fall
back
to
earth
thus
speak
the
worldly
wise
as
if
death
could
still
the
burning
thirst
for
light
as
if
the
hunger
for
the
ideal
could
ever
be
appeased
by
the
thought
of
destruction
the
worldly
wise
never
feel
the
irresistible
urge
to
dare
the
cruel
fates
with
the
adder
in
maxim
gorki
song
of
the
falcon
they
sneer
what
is
the
sky
an
empty
place
why
disturb
the
soul
with
the
desire
to
soar
into
the
sky
queer
birds
they
laugh
at
the
falcons
not
knowing
the
earth
and
grieving
on
it
they
yearn
for
the
sky
seeking
for
light
in
the
sultry
desert
for
it
is
only
a
desert
with
no
food
and
no
supporting
place
for
a
living
body
the
heinrichs
are
the
social
falcons
and
though
they
perish
when
they
fall
to
earth
they
die
in
the
triumphant
glory
of
having
beheld
the
sun
of
having
braved
the
storm
defied
the
clouds
and
mastered
the
air
the
sea
sparkles
in
the
glowing
light
the
waves
dash
against
the
shore
in
their
roar
a
song
resounds
about
the
proud
falcons
o
daring
falcon
in
the
battle
with
sinister
forces
you
lose
your
life
but
the
time
will
come
when
your
precious
blood
will
illumine
like
the
burning
torch
of
truth
the
dark
horizon
of
man
when
your
blood
shall
inflame
many
brave
hearts
with
a
burning
desire
for
freedom
the
time
when
the
peals
of
heinrich
bell
will
call
the
strong
and
daring
to
battle
for
light
and
joy
hark
is
the
music
of
the
song
the
sun
the
sun
draws
near
and
though
the
night
is
long
dawn
breaks
its
first
rays
falling
on
the
dying
heinrichs
frank
wedekind
the
awakening
of
spring
frank
wedekind
is
perhaps
the
most
daring
dramatic
spirit
in
germany
coming
to
the
fore
much
later
than
sudermann
and
hauptmann
he
did
not
follow
in
their
path
but
set
out
in
quest
of
new
truths
more
boldly
than
any
other
dramatist
frank
wedekind
has
laid
bare
the
shams
of
morality
in
reference
to
sex
especially
attacking
the
ignorance
surrounding
the
sex
life
of
the
child
and
its
resultant
tragedies
wedekind
became
widely
known
through
his
great
drama
the
awakening
of
spring
which
he
called
a
tragedy
of
childhood
dedicating
the
work
to
parents
and
teachers
verily
an
appropriate
dedication
because
parents
and
teachers
are
in
relation
to
the
child
needs
the
most
ignorant
and
mentally
indolent
class
needless
to
say
this
element
entirely
failed
to
grasp
the
social
significance
of
wedekind
work
on
the
contrary
they
saw
in
it
an
invasion
of
their
traditional
authority
and
an
outrage
on
the
sacred
rights
of
parenthood
the
critics
also
could
see
naught
in
wedekind
except
a
base
perverted
almost
diabolic
nature
bereft
of
all
finer
feeling
but
professional
critics
seldom
see
below
the
surface
else
they
would
discover
beneath
the
grin
and
satire
of
frank
wedekind
a
sensitive
soul
deeply
stirred
by
the
tragedies
about
him
stirred
and
grieved
especially
by
the
misery
and
torture
of
the
child
the
helpless
victim
unable
to
explain
the
forces
germinating
in
its
nature
often
crushed
and
destroyed
by
mock
modesty
sham
decencies
and
the
complacent
morality
that
greet
its
blind
gropings
never
was
a
more
powerful
indictment
hurled
against
society
which
out
of
sheer
hypocrisy
and
cowardice
persists
that
boys
and
girls
must
grow
up
in
ignorance
of
their
sex
functions
that
they
must
be
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
stupidity
and
convention
which
taboo
the
enlightenment
of
the
child
in
questions
of
such
elemental
importance
to
health
and
the
most
criminal
phase
of
the
indictment
however
is
that
it
is
generally
the
most
promising
children
who
are
sacrificed
to
sex
ignorance
and
to
the
total
lack
of
appreciation
on
the
part
of
teachers
of
the
latent
qualities
and
tendencies
in
the
child
the
one
slaying
the
body
and
soul
the
other
paralyzing
the
function
of
the
brain
and
both
conspiring
to
give
to
the
world
mental
and
physical
mediocrities
the
awakening
of
spring
is
laid
in
three
acts
and
fourteen
scenes
consisting
almost
entirely
of
dialogues
among
the
children
so
close
is
wedekind
to
the
soul
of
the
child
that
he
succeeds
in
unveiling
before
our
eyes
with
a
most
gripping
touch
its
joys
and
sorrows
its
hopes
and
despair
its
struggles
and
tragedies
the
play
deals
with
a
group
of
school
children
just
entering
the
age
of
puberty
imaginative
beings
speculating
about
the
mysteries
of
life
sent
to
her
grave
by
her
loving
but
prudish
mother
is
an
exquisite
lovable
child
the
innocent
father
of
unborn
baby
is
a
gifted
boy
whose
thirst
for
knowledge
leads
him
to
inquire
into
the
riddle
of
life
and
to
share
his
observations
with
his
school
chums
a
youth
who
in
a
free
and
intelligent
atmosphere
might
have
developed
into
an
original
thinker
that
such
a
boy
should
be
punished
as
a
moral
pervert
only
goes
to
prove
the
utter
unfitness
of
our
educators
and
parents
playfellow
is
driven
to
suicide
because
he
can
not
pass
his
examinations
thanks
to
our
stupid
and
criminal
system
of
education
which
consists
in
cramming
the
mind
to
the
bursting
point
wedekind
has
been
accused
of
exaggerating
his
types
but
any
one
familiar
with
child
life
knows
that
every
word
in
the
awakening
of
spring
is
vividly
true
the
conversation
between
and
for
instance
is
typical
of
all
boys
not
mentally
inert
i
like
to
know
why
we
really
are
on
earth
i
rather
be
a
than
go
to
school
why
do
we
go
to
school
we
go
to
school
so
that
somebody
can
examine
us
and
why
do
they
examine
us
in
order
that
we
may
fail
seven
must
fail
because
the
upper
classroom
will
hold
only
i
feel
so
queer
since
the
devil
take
me
if
it
were
not
for
papa
pack
my
bundle
and
go
to
altoona
do
you
believe
melchior
that
the
feeling
of
shame
in
man
is
only
a
product
of
his
education
i
was
thinking
over
that
for
the
first
time
the
day
before
yesterday
it
seems
to
me
deeply
rooted
in
human
nature
only
think
you
must
appear
entirely
clothed
before
your
best
friend
you
would
do
so
if
he
did
do
the
same
therefore
it
more
or
less
of
a
fashion
have
you
experienced
it
yet
what
how
do
you
say
it
manhood
emotion
m
certainly
i
also
i
known
that
for
a
long
while
almost
for
a
year
i
was
startled
as
if
by
lightning
did
you
dream
only
for
a
little
while
of
legs
in
light
blue
tights
that
strode
over
the
cathedral
to
be
correct
i
thought
they
wanted
to
go
over
it
i
only
saw
them
for
an
instant
george
zirschnitz
dreamed
of
his
mother
did
he
tell
you
that
i
thought
i
was
incurable
i
believed
i
was
suffering
from
an
inward
finally
i
became
calm
enough
to
begin
to
jot
down
the
recollections
of
my
life
yes
yes
dear
melchior
the
last
three
weeks
have
been
a
gethsemane
for
me
truly
they
play
a
remarkable
game
with
us
and
we
expected
to
give
thanks
for
it
i
do
remember
to
have
had
any
longing
for
this
kind
of
excitement
why
did
they
let
me
sleep
peacefully
until
all
was
still
again
my
dear
parents
might
have
had
a
hundred
better
children
i
came
here
i
do
know
how
and
must
be
responsible
myself
for
not
staying
have
you
often
wondered
melchior
by
what
means
we
were
brought
into
this
whirl
do
you
know
that
yet
either
moritz
how
should
i
know
it
i
see
how
the
hens
lay
eggs
and
hear
that
mamma
had
to
carry
me
under
her
heart
but
is
that
enough
i
have
gone
through
meyer
little
encyclopedia
from
a
to
z
words
nothing
but
words
and
words
not
a
single
plain
explanation
oh
this
feeling
of
shame
what
good
to
me
is
an
encyclopedia
that
wo
answer
me
concerning
the
most
important
question
in
life
yes
of
what
good
is
an
encyclopedia
or
the
other
wise
books
to
the
quivering
restless
spirit
of
the
child

answer
anywhere
least
of
all
from
your
own
mother
as
and
many
another
like
her
have
found
out
the
girl

that
her
sister

a
new
baby

to
her
mother
to
find
out
how

the
world

a
sister

been
married

two
and
a
half
years
i
myself
have
been

i
who
am
fourteen

in
the
stork

that
but

everybody
is
delighted

god

and
suppose
your
child
went
out
and
asked
the
chimney
sweep
but
that
would
be
madness

child

here
i
tell
you

tell
you

in
order
to

a
child
one

i
tell

as
one
can
only
love
a
man
one
must
love
him
so
much
with
one
whole
heart
so
so
that
one
ca
describe
it
one
must
love
him
wendla
as
you
at
your
age
are
still
unable
to
love
now
you
know
it
how
much
knew
her
mother
found
out
when
too
late
and
overtaken
by
a
storm
seek
shelter
in
a
haystack
and
are
drawn
by
what
calls
the
first
emotion
of
manhood
and
curiosity
into
each
other
arms
six
months
later
mother
discovers
that
her
child
is
to
become
a
mother
to
save
the
family
honor
the
girl
is
promptly
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
quack
who
treats
her
for
chlorosis
no
mother
no
i
know
it
i
feel
it
i
have
chlorosis
i
have
dropsy
i
wo
get
better
i
have
the
dropsy
i
must
die
mother
o
mother
i
must
die
you
must
not
die
child
you
must
not
die
great
heavens
you
must
not
die
but
why
do
you
weep
so
frightfully
then
you
must
not
die
child
you
have
the
dropsy
you
have
a
child
girl
you
have
a
child
oh
why
did
you
do
that
to
me
i
have
done
anything
to
you
oh
do
deny
it
any
more
wendla
i
know
everything
see
i
did
want
to
say
a
word
to
wendla
my
wendla
but
it
not
possible
mother
i
have
loved
nobody
in
the
world
as
i
do
you
mother
the
pathos
of
it
that
such
a
loving
mother
should
be
responsible
for
the
death
of
her
own
child
yet
is
but
one
of
the
many
good
pious
mothers
who
lay
their
children
to
rest
in
god
with
the
inscription
on
the
tombstone
wendla
bergmann
born
may
died
from
chlorosis
blessed
are
the
pure
of
heart
like
was
also
pure
of
heart
yet
how
was
he
blessed
surely
not
by
his
teachers
who
discovering
his
essay
on
the
mystery
of
life
expel
the
boy
from
school
only
wedekind
could
inject
such
grim
humor
into
the
farce
of
education
the
smug
importance
of
the
faculty
of
the
high
school
sitting
under
the
portraits
of
rousseau
and
pestalozzi
and
pronouncing
judgment
on
their
immoral
pupil
gentlemen
we
can
not
help
moving
the
expulsion
of
our
guilty
pupil
before
the
national
board
of
education
there
are
the
strongest
reasons
why
we
can
not
we
can
not
because
we
must
expiate
the
misfortune
which
has
fallen
upon
us
already
we
can
not
because
of
our
need
to
protect
ourselves
from
similar
blows
in
the
future
we
can
not
because
we
must
chastise
our
guilty
pupil
for
the
demoralizing
influence
he
exerted
upon
his
classmates
we
can
not
above
all
because
we
must
hinder
him
from
exerting
the
same
influence
upon
his
remaining
classmates
we
can
not
ignore
the
charge
and
this
gentlemen
is
possibly
the
weightiest
of
all
on
any
pretext
concerning
a
ruined
career
because
it
is
our
duty
to
protect
ourselves
from
an
epidemic
of
suicide
similar
to
that
which
has
broken
out
recently
in
various
grammar
schools
and
which
until
has
mocked
all
attempts
of
the
teachers
to
shackle
it
by
any
means
known
to
advanced
education
we
see
ourselves
under
the
necessity
of
judging
the
that
we
may
not
be
judged
guilty
ourselves
are
you
the
author
of
this
obscene
manuscript
yes
i
request
you
sir
to
show
me
anything
obscene
in
it
you
have
as
little
respect
for
the
dignity
of
your
assembled
teachers
as
you
have
a
proper
appreciation
of
innate
sense
of
shame
which
belongs
to
a
moral
world
mother
a
modern
type
has
greater
faith
in
her
child
than
in
school
education
but
even
she
can
not
hold
out
against
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
still
less
against
the
father
of
a
firm
believer
in
authority
and
discipline
anyone
who
can
write
what
melchior
wrote
must
be
rotten
to
the
core
of
his
being
the
mark
is
plain
a
nature
would
do
such
a
thing
none
of
us
are
saints
each
of
us
wanders
from
the
straight
path
his
writing
on
the
contrary
tramples
on
principles
his
writing
is
no
evidence
of
a
chance
slip
in
the
usual
way
it
sets
forth
with
dreadful
plainness
and
a
frankly
definite
purpose
that
natural
longing
that
propensity
for
immorality
because
it
is
immorality
his
writing
manifests
that
exceptional
state
of
spiritual
corruption
which
we
jurists
classify
under
the
term
moral
imbecility
between
the
parents
and
the
educators
is
martyred
even
as
he
is
sent
to
the
house
of
correction
but
being
of
sturdier
stock
than
the
girl
he
survives
not
so
his
chum
harassed
by
the
impelling
forces
of
his
awakened
nature
and
unable
to
grapple
with
the
torturous
tasks
demanded
by
his
educators
at
the
most
critical
period
of
his
life
fails
in
the
examinations
he
can
not
face
his
parents
they
have
placed
all
their
hope
in
him
and
have
lashed
him
by
the
subtle
cruelty
of
gratitude
to
the
grindstone
till
his
brain
reeled
is
the
third
victim
in
the
tragedy
the
most
convenient
explanation
of
which
is
given
by
in
the
funeral
sermon
he
who
rejects
the
grace
with
which
the
everlasting
father
has
blessed
those
born
in
sin
he
shall
die
a
spiritual
death
he
however
who
in
willful
carnal
abnegation
of
god
proper
honor
lives
for
and
serves
evil
shall
die
the
death
of
the
body
who
however
wickedly
throws
away
from
him
the
cross
which
the
all
merciful
has
laid
upon
him
for
his
sins
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
shall
die
the
everlasting
death
let
us
however
praise
the
all
gracious
lord
and
thank
him
for
his
inscrutable
grace
in
order
that
we
may
travel
the
thorny
path
more
and
more
surely
for
as
truly
as
this
one
died
a
triple
death
as
truly
will
the
lord
god
conduct
the
righteous
unto
happiness
and
everlasting
life
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
point
out
the
revolutionary
significance
of
this
extraordinary
play
it
speaks
powerfully
for
itself
one
need
only
add
that
the
awakening
of
spring
has
done
much
to
dispel
the
mist
enveloping
the
paramount
issue
of
sex
in
the
education
of
the
child
it
is
conceded
even
by
conservative
elements
that
the
conspiracy
of
silence
has
been
a
fatal
mistake
and
while
sponsors
of
the
church
and
of
moral
fixity
still
clamor
for
the
good
old
methods
the
message
of
wedekind
is
making
itself
felt
throughout
the
world
breaking
down
the
barriers
the
child
is
the
unit
of
the
race
and
only
through
its
unhampered
unfoldment
can
humanity
come
into
its
heritage
the
awakening
of
spring
is
one
of
the
great
forces
of
modern
times
that
is
paving
the
way
for
the
birth
of
a
free
race
the
french
drama
maeterlinck
to
those
who
are
conversant
with
the
works
of
maeterlinck
it
may
seem
rather
to
discuss
him
from
the
point
of
view
of
revolutionary
and
social
significance
above
all
maeterlinck
is
the
portrayer
of
the
remote
the
poet
of
symbols
therefore
it
may
seem
out
of
place
to
bring
him
down
to
earth
to
simplify
him
or
to
interpret
his
revolutionary
spirit
to
some
extent
these
objections
have
considerable
weight
but
on
the
other
hand
if
one
keeps
in
mind
that
only
those
who
go
to
the
remote
are
capable
of
understanding
the
obvious
one
will
readily
see
how
very
significant
maeterlinck
is
as
a
revolutionizing
factor
besides
we
have
maeterlinck
own
conception
of
the
significance
of
the
revolutionary
spirit
in
a
very
masterly
article
called
the
social
revolution
he
discusses
the
objection
on
the
part
of
the
conservative
section
of
society
to
the
introduction
of
revolutionary
methods
he
says
that
they
would
like
us
to
go
slow
that
they
object
to
the
use
of
violence
and
the
forcible
overthrow
of
the
evils
of
society
and
maeterlinck
answers
in
these
significant
words
we
are
too
ready
to
forget
that
the
headsmen
of
misery
are
less
noisy
less
theatrical
but
infinitely
more
numerous
more
cruel
and
active
than
those
of
the
most
terrible
revolutions
maeterlinck
realizes
that
there
are
certain
grievances
in
society
iniquitous
conditions
which
demand
immediate
solution
and
that
if
we
do
not
solve
them
with
the
readiest
and
quickest
methods
at
our
command
they
will
react
upon
society
and
upon
life
a
great
deal
more
terribly
than
even
the
most
terrible
revolutions
no
wonder
then
that
his
works
were
put
under
the
ban
by
the
catholic
church
which
forever
sees
danger
in
light
and
emancipation
surely
if
maeterlinck
were
not
primarily
the
spokesman
of
truth
he
would
be
embraced
by
the
catholic
church
in
monna
vanna
maeterlinck
gives
a
wonderful
picture
of
the
new
woman
not
the
new
woman
as
portrayed
in
the
newspapers
but
the
new
woman
as
a
reborn
regenerated
spirit
the
woman
who
has
emancipated
herself
from
her
narrow
outlook
upon
life
and
detached
herself
from
the
confines
of
the
home
the
woman
in
short
who
has
become
and
therefore
understands
that
she
is
a
unit
in
the
great
ocean
of
life
and
that
she
must
take
her
place
as
an
independent
factor
in
order
to
rebuild
and
remold
life
in
proportion
as
she
learns
to
become
does
she
become
a
factor
in
the
reconstruction
of
society
valuable
to
herself
to
her
children
and
to
the
race
pisa
is
subdued
by
the
forces
of
florence
it
is
beaten
and
conquered
the
city
is
in
danger
of
being
destroyed
and
the
people
exposed
to
famine
and
annihilation
there
is
only
one
way
of
saving
pisa
the
father
of
the
commander
of
pisa
brings
the
ultimatum
of
the
enemy
know
then
that
i
saw
prinzivalle
and
spoke
with
him
i
thought
to
find
some
barbarian
arrogant
and
heavy
always
covered
with
blood
or
plunged
in
drunken
stupor
at
best
the
madman
they
have
told
us
of
whose
spirit
was
lit
up
at
times
upon
the
battlefield
by
dazzling
flashes
of
brilliance
coming
no
man
knows
whence
i
thought
to
meet
the
demon
of
combat
blind
unreasoning
vain
and
cruel
faithless
and
dissolute
i
found
a
man
who
bowed
before
me
as
a
loving
disciple
bows
before
the
master
he
is
lettered
eager
for
knowledge
and
obedient
to
the
voice
of
wisdom
he
loves
not
war
his
smile
speaks
of
understanding
and
gentle
humanity
he
seeks
the
reason
of
passions
and
events
he
looks
into
his
own
heart
he
is
endowed
with
conscience
and
sincerity
and
it
is
against
his
will
that
he
serves
a
faithless
state
i
have
told
you
that
prinzivalle
seems
wise
that
he
is
humane
and
reasonable
but
where
is
the
wise
man
that
hath
not
his
private
madness
the
good
man
to
whom
no
monstrous
idea
has
ever
come
on
one
side
is
reason
and
pity
and
justice
on
the
other
ah
is
desire
and
passion
and
what
you
will
the
insanity
into
which
we
all
fall
at
times
i
have
fallen
into
it
myself
and
shall
belike
again
so
have
you
man
is
made
in
that
fashion
a
grief
which
should
not
be
within
the
experience
of
man
is
on
the
point
of
touching
you
hearken
this
great
convoy
the
victuals
that
i
have
seen
wagons
running
over
with
corn
others
full
of
wine
and
fruit
flocks
of
sheep
and
herds
of
cattle
enough
to
feed
a
city
for
months
all
these
tuns
of
powder
and
bars
of
lead
with
which
you
may
vanquish
florence
and
make
pisa
lift
her
head
all
this
will
enter
the
city
if
you
send
in
exchange
to
give
her
up
to
prinzivalle
until
dawn
for
he
will
send
her
back
when
the
first
faint
gray
shows
in
the
sky
only
he
exacts
that
in
sign
of
victory
and
submission
she
shall
come
alone
and
her
cloak
for
all
her
covering
who
who
shall
thus
come
giovanna
my
wife
vanna
ay
your
vanna
in
the
consciousness
that
the
woman
belongs
to
him
that
no
man
may
even
look
with
desire
upon
her
dazzling
beauty
resents
this
mortal
insult
he
is
willing
that
all
the
other
women
should
face
danger
that
the
little
children
of
pisa
should
be
exposed
to
hunger
and
destruction
rather
than
that
he
give
up
his
possession
but
does
not
hesitate
when
she
is
before
the
issue
of
saving
her
people
she
does
not
stop
to
consider
she
goes
into
the
enemy
tent
as
a
child
might
go
without
consciousness
of
self
imbued
solely
with
the
impulse
to
save
her
people
the
meeting
of
and
is
an
exquisite
interpretation
of
love
the
sweetness
purity
and
fragrance
of
love
for
the
woman
of
his
dream
the
one
he
had
known
when
she
was
but
a
child
and
who
remained
an
inspiring
vision
all
through
his
career
he
knows
he
can
not
reach
her
he
also
knows
that
he
will
be
destroyed
by
the
political
intriguers
of
florence
and
he
stakes
his
all
on
this
one
step
to
satisfy
the
dream
of
his
life
to
see
and
in
return
to
save
pisa
had
there
come
ten
thousand
of
you
into
my
tent
all
clad
alike
all
equally
fair
ten
thousand
sisters
whom
even
their
mother
would
not
know
apart
i
should
have
risen
should
have
taken
your
hand
and
said
this
is
she
is
it
not
strange
that
a
beloved
image
can
live
thus
in
a
man
heart
for
yours
lived
so
in
mine
that
each
day
it
changed
as
in
real
life
the
image
of
replaced
that
of
yesterday
it
blossomed
out
it
became
always
fairer
and
the
years
adorned
it
with
all
that
they
add
to
a
child
that
grows
in
grace
and
beauty
but
when
i
saw
you
again
it
seemed
to
me
at
first
that
my
eyes
deceived
me
my
memories
were
so
fair
and
so
fond
but
they
had
been
too
slow
and
too
timid
they
had
not
dared
to
give
you
all
the
splendor
which
appeared
so
suddenly
to
dazzle
me
i
was
as
a
man
that
recalled
to
mind
a
flower
he
had
but
seen
in
passing
through
a
garden
on
a
gray
day
and
should
be
suddenly
confronted
with
a
hundred
thousand
as
fair
in
a
field
bathed
with
sunshine
i
saw
once
more
your
hair
your
brow
your
eyes
and
i
found
all
the
soul
of
the
face
i
had
adored
but
how
its
beauty
shames
that
which
i
had
treasured
in
silence
through
endless
days
through
years
whose
only
light
was
a
memory
that
had
taken
too
long
a
road
and
found
itself
outshone
by
the
reality
ah
i
knew
not
too
well
what
i
meant
to
do
i
felt
that
i
was
lost
and
i
desired
to
drag
with
me
all
i
could
and
i
hated
you
because
of
the
love
yes
i
should
have
gone
to
the
end
had
it
not
been
yet
any
other
would
have
seemed
odious
to
me
you
yourself
would
have
had
to
be
other
than
you
are
i
lose
my
reason
when
i
think
of
it
one
word
would
have
been
enough
that
was
different
from
your
words
one
gesture
that
was
not
yours
the
slightest
thing
would
have
inflamed
my
hate
and
let
loose
the
monster
but
when
i
saw
you
i
saw
in
that
same
moment
that
it
was
impossible
i
felt
a
change
too
i
marveled
that
i
could
speak
to
you
as
i
have
spoken
since
the
first
moment
i
am
silent
by
nature
i
have
never
spoken
thus
to
any
man
unless
it
be
to
marco
guido
father
and
even
with
him
it
is
not
the
same
he
has
a
thousand
dreams
that
take
up
all
his
mind
and
we
have
talked
but
a
few
times
the
others
have
always
a
desire
in
their
eyes
that
will
not
suffer
one
to
tell
them
that
one
loves
them
and
would
fain
know
what
they
have
in
their
hearts
in
your
eyes
too
a
longing
burns
but
it
is
not
the
same
it
does
not
affright
me
nor
fill
me
with
loathing
i
felt
at
once
that
i
knew
you
before
i
remembered
that
i
had
ever
seen
you
awed
by
the
character
and
personality
of
this
despised
and
hated
outlaw
pleads
with
him
to
come
with
her
to
pisa
under
the
protection
of
herself
and
her
husband
she
is
sure
that
he
will
be
safe
with
them
and
that
he
will
be
hailed
as
the
redeemer
of
the
people
of
pisa
like
innocent
children
they
walk
to
their
doom
is
honored
by
the
people
whom
she
has
saved
but
scorned
by
her
husband
who
like
the
true
male
does
not
credit
her
story
hear
me
i
say
i
have
never
lied
but
above
all
days
i
tell
the
deepest
truth
the
truth
that
can
be
told
but
once
and
brings
life
or
death
hearken
guido
then
and
look
upon
me
if
you
have
never
known
me
until
this
hour
the
first
and
only
hour
when
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
love
me
as
i
would
be
loved
i
speak
in
the
name
of
our
life
of
all
that
i
am
of
all
that
you
are
to
me
be
strong
enough
to
believe
that
which
is
incredible
this
man
has
spared
my
honor
he
had
all
power
i
was
given
over
to
him
yet
he
has
not
touched
me
i
have
issued
from
his
tent
as
i
might
from
my
brother
house
i
gave
him
one
only
kiss
upon
the
brow
and
he
gave
it
me
again
ah
that
was
what
you
were
to
tell
us
that
was
the
miracle
ay
already
at
the
first
words
i
divined
something
beneath
them
that
i
understood
not
it
passed
me
like
a
flash
i
took
no
heed
of
it
but
i
see
now
that
i
must
look
more
closely
so
when
he
had
you
in
his
tent
alone
with
a
cloak
for
all
your
covering
all
night
long
you
say
he
spared
you
am
i
a
man
to
believe
that
the
stars
are
fragments
of
hellebore
or
that
one
may
drop
something
into
a
well
and
put
out
the
moon
what
a
man
desires
you
so
utterly
that
he
will
betray
his
country
stake
all
that
he
has
for
one
single
night
ruin
himself
forever
and
do
it
basely
do
such
a
deed
as
no
man
ever
thought
to
do
before
him
and
make
the
world
uninhabitable
to
himself
forever
and
this
man
has
you
there
in
his
tent
alone
and
defenseless
and
he
has
but
this
single
night
that
he
has
bought
at
such
a
price
and
he
contents
himself
with
a
kiss
upon
the
brow
and
comes
even
hither
to
make
us
give
him
credence
no
let
us
reason
fairly
and
not
too
long
mock
at
misfortune
if
he
asked
but
that
what
need
was
there
that
he
should
plunge
a
whole
people
into
sadness
sink
me
in
an
abyss
of
misery
such
that
i
have
come
from
it
crushed
and
older
by
ten
years
ah
had
he
craved
but
a
kiss
upon
the
brow
he
might
have
saved
us
without
torturing
us
so
he
had
but
to
come
like
a
god
to
our
rescue
but
a
kiss
upon
the
brow
is
not
demanded
and
prepared
for
after
his
fashion
the
truth
is
found
in
our
cries
of
anguish
and
despair
it
is
only
at
this
psychological
moment
a
moment
that
sometimes
changes
all
our
conceptions
all
our
thoughts
our
very
life
that
feels
the
new
love
for
stirring
in
her
soul
a
love
that
knows
no
doubt
the
conception
of
such
a
love
is
revolutionary
in
the
scope
of
its
possibilities
a
love
that
is
pregnant
with
the
spirit
of
daring
of
freedom
that
lifts
woman
out
of
the
ordinary
and
inspires
her
with
the
strength
and
joy
of
molding
a
new
and
free
race
rostand
chantecler
in
view
of
the
progress
the
modern
drama
has
made
as
an
interpreter
of
social
ideas
and
portrayer
of
the
human
struggle
against
internal
and
external
barriers
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
the
future
may
bring
in
the
way
of
great
dramatic
achievement
so
far
however
there
is
hardly
anything
to
compare
with
chantecler
in
philosophic
depth
and
poetic
beauty
is
the
intense
idealist
whose
mission
is
light
and
truth
his
soul
is
aglow
with
deep
human
sympathies
and
his
great
purpose
in
life
is
to
dispel
the
night
he
keeps
aloof
from
mediocrity
indeed
he
has
little
knowledge
of
his
immediate
surroundings
like
all
great
visionaries
is
human
all
too
human
therefore
subject
to
agonizing
soul
depressions
and
doubts
always
however
he
regains
confidence
and
strength
when
he
is
close
to
the
soil
when
he
feels
the
precious
sap
of
the
earth
surging
through
his
being
at
such
times
he
feels
the
mysterious
power
that
gives
him
strength
to
proclaim
the
truth
to
call
forth
the
golden
glory
of
the
day
the
is
the
eternal
female
bewitchingly
beautiful
but
and
vain
true
to
her
destiny
she
must
possess
the
man
and
is
jealous
of
everything
that
stands
between
her
and
him
she
loves
she
therefore
employs
every
device
to
kill
faith
in
himself
for
as
she
tells
him
you
can
be
all
in
all
to
me
but
nothing
to
the
dawn
the
is
the
modernist
who
has
become
blasÃ©
mentally
and
spiritually
empty
he
is
a
cynic
and
scoffer
without
principle
or
sincerity
himself
he
sees
only
small
and
petty
intentions
in
everybody
else
true
and
stanch
is
the
symbol
of
honest
conviction
and
simplicity
of
soul
he
loathes
the
blackbird
because
he
sees
in
him
the
embodiment
of
a
shallow
superficial
modernity
a
modernity
barren
of
all
poetic
vision
which
aims
only
at
material
success
and
tinseled
display
without
regard
for
worth
harmony
or
peace
the
is
the
overbearing
conceited
intellectual
charlatan
the
spokesman
of
our
culture
the
idle
prater
of
art
for
sake
as
such
he
sets
the
style
and
pace
for
the
idle
pursuits
of
an
idle
class
the
is
none
other
than
our
most
illustrious
society
lady
sterile
of
mind
and
empty
of
soul
she
flits
from
one
social
function
to
another
taking
up
every
fad
clinging
to
the
coattails
of
every
newcomer
provided
he
represent
station
and

she
is
the
slave
of

the
imitator
of

the
silly
hunter

in

the
parasite
upon

the
ignorant
stupid
maintainers
of
the
old
they
detest
the
light
because
it
exposes
their
mediocrity
and
stagnation
they
hate
because
as
the
old

simple
torture
it
is
to
hear
a
brazen
throat
forever
reminding
you
of
what
you
know

too
true
this
is
a
crime
mediocrity
never
forgives
and
it
conspires
to
kill

then
is
a
scathing
arraignment
of
the
emptiness
of

of

conventional

the
petty
jealousies

chantecler
characterizes
the
lack
of
understanding
for

appreciation
of

and
the
idealists
the
mob
spirit
whether
on
top
or
at

bottom
using
the
most
cruel
and
contemptible
methods
to
drag
the
idealist
down
to
revile
and
persecute
him
aye
even
to
kill
him
for
the
unpardonable
sin
of
proclaiming
the
ideal

can
not

for
worshiping
the
sun
blaze
forth
in
glory
o
thou
that
driest
the
tears
of
the

dost
of
a

flower
make
a
living
butterfly
thy
miracle
wherever
shower
down
the
wind
their
scented
shreds
dead
petals
dancing

thee
o
sun
whose
ample
light
blessing
every

ripening
every

every

itself
forth
and

sing
of
thee

be
thy

disdainest
not
to

thy

thou

cutting
out

atmosphere
of
persecution
and
hatred
continues
to
hope
and
to
work
for
his
sublime
mission
of
bringing
the
golden
day
but
his
passion
for
the
proves
his
waterloo
it
is
through
her
that
he
grows
weak
disclosing
his
secret
because
of
her
he
attends
the
silly
five
function
at
the
and
is
involved
in
a
prize
fight
his
passion
teaches
him
to
understand
life
and
the
frailties
of
his
fellow
creatures
he
learns
the
greatest
of
all
truths
that
it
is
the
struggle
for
rather
than
the
attainment
of
the
ideal
which
must
forever
inspire
the
sincere
honest
idealist
indeed
it
is
life
which
teaches
that
if
he
can
not
wake
the
dawn
he
must
rouse
mankind
to
greet
the
sun
finds
himself
in
a
trying
situation
when
he
comes
into
the
gathering
at
the
five
tea
to
meet
the
pompous
overbearing
cocks
representing
the
various
governments
when
he
arrives
in
the
midst
of
these
distinguished
society
people
he
is
plied
with
the
query
how
do
you
sing
do
you
sing
the
italian
school
or
the
french
school
or
the
german
school
poor
in
the
simplicity
of
his
idealism
replies
i
do
know
how
i
sing
but
i
know
why
i
sing
why
need
the
chanteclers
know
how
they
sing
they
represent
the
truth
which
needs
no
stylish
clothes
or
expensive
feathers
that
is
the
difference
between
truth
and
falsehood
falsehood
must
deck
herself
out
beyond
all
semblance
of
nature
and
reality
i
say
that
these
resplendent
gentlemen
are
manufactured
wares
the
work
of
merchants
with
highly
complex
brains
who
to
fashion
a
ridiculous
chicken
have
taken
a
wing
from
that
one
a
topknot
from
this
i
say
that
in
such
cocks
nothing
remains
of
the
true
cock
they
are
cocks
of
shreds
and
patches
idle
fit
to
figure
in
a
catalogue
not
in
a
barnyard
with
its
decent
dunghill
and
its
dog
i
say
that
those
befrizzled
beruffled
bedeviled
cocks
were
never
stroked
and
cherished
by
nature
maternal
hand
and
i
add
that
the
whole
duty
of
a
cock
is
to
be
an
embodied
crimson
cry
and
when
a
cock
is
not
that
it
matters
little
that
his
comb
be
shaped
like
a
toadstool
or
his
quills
twisted
like
a
screw
he
will
soon
vanish
and
be
heard
of
no
more
having
been
nothing
but
a
variety
of
a
variety
the
appears
he
greets
with
the
announcement
that
he
is
the
champion
fighter
that
he
has
killed
so
and
so
many
cocks
in
one
day
and
an
equal
number
on
other
occasions
replies
simply
i
have
never
killed
anything
but
as
i
have
at
different
times
succored
defended
protected
this
one
and
that
i
might
perhaps
be
called
in
my
fashion
brave
the
fight
begins
is
wounded
and
about
to
succumb
when
suddenly
all
the
guests
present
rush
to
for
protection
the
common
enemy
the
is
seen
to
approach
mistakes
the
cowardice
of
those
who
come
to
seek
his
aid
for
friendship
but
the
moment
the
danger
is
over
the
crowd
again
circles
around
the
fighters
inciting
the
to
kill
but
at
the
critical
moment
the
mortally
wounds
himself
with
his
own
spurs
and
is
jeered
and
driven
off
the
scene
by
the
same
mob
that
formerly
cheered
him
on
weak
and
exhausted
from
loss
of
blood
disillusioned
and
stung
to
the
very
soul
follows
the
to
the
forest
soon
he
finds
himself
a
henpecked
husband
he
may
not
crow
to
his
heart
content
any
more
he
may
not
wake
the
sun
for
his
lady
love
is
jealous
the
only
time
he
can
crow
is
when
her
eyes
are
closed
in
sleep
but
leave
it
to
the
to
ferret
out
a
secret
overhearing
conversation
with
the
she
is
furious
i
will
not
let
the
sun
defraud
me
of
my
love
she
cries
but
replies
there
is
no
great
love
outside
of
the
shadow
of
the
ideal
she
makes
use
of
her
beauty
and
charm
to
win
him
from
the
sun
she
embraces
him
and
pleads
come
to
my
soft
bosom
why
need
you
bother
about
the
sun
hears
the
nightingale
and
like
all
great
artists
he
recognizes
her
wonderful
voice
her
inspiring
powers
compared
with
which
his
own
must
seem
hard
and
crude
suddenly
a
shot
is
heard
and
the
little
bird
falls
dead
to
the
ground
is
and
as
he
mourns
the
sweet
singer
the
dawn
begins
to
break
the
covers
him
with
her
wing
to
keep
him
from
seeing
the
sun
rise
and
then
mocks
him
because
the
sun
has
risen
without
his
crowing
the
shock
is
terrible
to
poor
yet
in
his
desperation
he
gives
one
tremendous
why
are
you
crowing
the
hen
asks
as
a
warning
to
myself
for
thrice
have
i
denied
the
thing
i
love
is
in
despair
but
now
he
hears
another
nightingale
more
silvery
and
beautiful
than
the
first
learn
comrade
this
sorrowful
and
reassuring
fact
that
no
one
cock
of
the
morning
or
evening
nightingale
has
quite
the
song
of
his
dreams
a
wonderful
message
for
there
must
always
be
in
the
soul
a
faith
so
faithful
that
it
comes
back
even
after
it
has
been
slain
it
is
vital
to
understand
that
it
is
rather
the
consciousness
that
though
we
can
not
wake
the
dawn
we
must
prepare
the
people
to
greet
the
rising
sun
brieux
damaged
goods
in
the
preface
to
the
english
edition
of
damaged
goods
george
bernard
shaw
relates
a
story
concerning
lord
melbourne
in
the
early
days
of
queen
victoria
when
the
cabinet
meeting
threatened
to
break
up
in
confusion
lord
melbourne
put
his
back
to
the
door
and
said
gentlemen
we
can
tell
the
house
the
truth
or
we
can
tell
it
a
lie
i
do
give
a
damn
which
it
is
all
i
insist
on
is
that
we
shall
all
tell
the
same
lie
and
you
shall
not
leave
the
room
until
you
have
settled
what
it
is
to
be
this
seems
to
characterize
the
position
of
our
morality
whether
a
thing
be
right
or
wrong
we
are
all
to
express
the
same
opinion
on
the
subject
all
must
agree
on
the
same
lie
and
the
lie
upon
which
all
agree
more
than
on
any
other
is
the
lie
of
purity
which
must
be
kept
up
at
all
costs
how
slow
our
moralists
move
is
best
proved
by
the
fact
that
although
the
great
scientist
neisser
had
discovered
as
far
back
as
that
supposedly
insignificant
venereal
afflictions
are
due
to
a
malignant
often
disastrous
not
only
to
the
immediate
victim
but
also
to
those
who
come
in
touch
with
him
the
subject
is
still
largely
tabooed
and
must
not
be
discussed
to
be
sure
there
is
a
small
contingent
of
men
and
women
who
realize
the
necessity
of
a
frank
discussion
of
the
very
important
matter
of
venereal
disease
but
unfortunately
they
are
attempting
to
drive
out
the
devil
with
fire
they
are
enlightening
the
public
as
to
the
gravity
of
gonorrhea
and
syphilis
but
are
implanting
an
evil
by
no
means
less
harmful
namely
the
element
of
fear
the
result
often
is
that
the
victims
who
contract
an
infection
are
as
little
capable
of
taking
care
of
themselves
now
as
in
the
past
when
they
knew
little
about
the
subject
brieux
is
among
the
few
who
treats
the
question
in
a
frank
manner
showing
that
the
most
dangerous
phase
of
venereal
disease
is
ignorance
and
fear
and
that
if
treated
openly
and
intelligently
it
is
perfectly
curable
brieux
also
emphasizes
the
importance
of
kindness
and
consideration
for
those
who
contract
the
affliction
since
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
is
commonly
called
evil
immorality
or
impurity
therein
lies
the
superiority
of
damaged
goods
to
most
scientific
treatises
without
lacking
logic
and
clarity
it
has
greater
humanity
and
warmth
but
damaged
goods
contains
more
than
an
exposÃ©
of
venereal
disease
it
touches
upon
the
whole
of
our
social
life
it
points
out
the
indifference
of
the
rich
toward
those
who
do
not
belong
to
their
class
to
the
poor
the
workers
the
disinherited
whom
they
sacrifice
without
the
slightest
compunction
on
the
altar
of
their
own
comforts
moreover
the
play
also
treats
of
the
contemptible
attitude
towards
love
not
backed
by
property
or
legal
sanction
in
short
it
uncovers
and
exposes
not
only
sexual
disease
but
that
which
is
even
more
terrible
our
social
disease
our
social
syphilis
the
son
of
wealthy
people
is
informed
by
a
specialist
that
he
has
contracted
a
venereal
disease
of
a
most
serious
nature
but
that
with
patience
and
time
he
will
be
cured
is
crushed
by
the
news
and
decides
to
blow
out
his
brains
his
only
regret
is
that
he
can
not
in
the
least
account
for
his
trouble
i
not
a
rake
doctor
my
life
might
be
held
up
as
an
example
to
all
young
men
i
assure
you
no
one
could
possibly
be
more
prudent
no
one
see
here
supposing
i
told
you
that
in
all
my
life
i
have
only
had
two
mistresses
what
would
you
say
to
that
that
would
have
been
enough
to
bring
you
here
no
doctor
not
one
of
those
two
no
one
in
the
world
has
dreaded
this
so
much
as
i
have
no
one
has
taken
such
infinite
precautions
to
avoid
it
my
first
mistress
was
the
wife
of
my
best
friend
i
chose
her
on
account
of
him
and
him
not
because
i
cared
most
for
him
but
because
i
knew
he
was
a
man
of
the
most
rigid
morals
who
watched
his
wife
jealously
and
did
let
her
go
about
forming
imprudent
connections
as
for
her
i
kept
her
in
absolute
terror
of
this
disease
i
told
her
that
almost
all
men
were
taken
with
it
so
that
she
might
dream
of
being
false
to
me
my
friend
died
in
my
arms
that
was
the
only
thing
that
could
have
separated
me
from
her
then
i
took
up
with
a
young
seamstress
well
this
was
a
decent
girl
with
a
family
in
needy
circumstances
to
support
her
grandmother
was
an
invalid
and
there
was
an
ailing
father
and
three
little
brothers
it
was
by
my
means
that
they
all
lived
i
told
her
and
i
let
the
others
know
that
if
she
played
me
false
i
should
leave
her
at
once
so
then
they
all
watched
her
for
me
it
became
a
regular
thing
that
i
should
spend
sunday
with
them
and
in
that
sort
of
way
i
was
able
to
give
her
a
lift
up
was
a
respectable
kind
of
outing
for
her
i
rented
a
pew
for
them
and
her
mother
used
to
go
with
her
to
church
they
liked
seeing
their
name
engraved
on
the
card
she
never
left
the
house
alone
three
months
ago
when
the
question
of
my
marriage
came
up
i
had
to
leave
her
you
were
very
happy
why
did
you
want
to
change
i
wanted
to
settle
down
my
father
was
a
notary
and
before
his
death
he
expressed
a
wish
that
i
should
marry
my
cousin
it
was
a
good
match
her
dowry
will
help
to
get
me
a
practice
besides
i
simply
adore
her
she
fond
of
me
too
i
had
everything
one
could
want
to
make
my
life
happy
and
then
a
lot
of
idiots
must
give
me
a
farewell
dinner
and
make
me
gad
about
with
them
see
what
has
come
of
it
i
have
any
luck
i
never
had
any
luck
i
know
fellows
who
lead
the
most
racketty
life
nothing
happens
to
them
the
beasts
but
i
for
a
wretched
lark
what
is
there
left
for
a
leper
like
me
my
future
is
ruined
my
whole
life
poisoned
well
then
is
it
better
for
me
to
clear
out
of
it
anyway
i
suffer
any
more
you
see
now
no
one
could
be
more
wretched
than
i
am
the
doctor
explains
to
him
that
there
is
no
need
for
despair
but
that
he
must
postpone
his
marriage
if
he
does
not
wish
to
ruin
his
wife
and
possibly
make
her
sterile
for
life
it
is
imperative
especially
because
of
the
offspring
which
is
certain
to
be
syphilitic
twenty
cases
identical
with
yours
have
been
carefully
observed
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
nineteen
times
you
hear
nineteen
times
in
twenty
the
woman
was
contaminated
by
her
husband
you
think
that
the
danger
is
negligible
you
think
you
have
the
right
to
let
your
wife
take
her
chance
as
you
said
of
being
one
of
the
exceptions
for
which
we
can
do
nothing
very
well
then
then
you
shall
know
what
you
are
doing
you
shall
know
what
sort
of
a
disease
it
is
that
your
wife
will
have
five
chances
per
cent
of
contracting
without
so
much
as
having
her
leave
asked
but
there
is
not
only
your
wife
there
are
her
children
your
children
whom
you
may
contaminate
too
it
is
in
the
name
of
those
innocent
little
ones
that
i
appeal
to
you
it
is
the
future
of
the
race
that
i
am
defending
but
will
not
postpone
the
marriage
for
several
years
he
would
have
to
give
an
explanation
break
his
word
and
lose
his
inheritance
things
infinitely
more
important
than
any
consideration
for
the
girl
he
adores
or
for
their
children
should
they
have
any
in
short
he
is
actuated
by
the
morality
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
silly
conception
of
honor
the
dread
of
public
opinion
and
above
all
the
greed
for
property
the
second
act
is
laid
at
the
home
of
and
his
wife
are
childishly
happy
except
for
the
regret
that
their
marriage
could
not
have
taken
place
six
months
earlier
because
poor
george
had
been
declared
consumptive
how
stupid
of
doctors
to
suspect
the
healthy
strong
of
consumption
but
then
all
doctors
are
stupid
but
now
that
they
are
together
nothing
shall
part
them
in
their
great
happiness
and
especially
in
their
great
love
for
their
baby
true
a
little
cloud
obscures
their
sunny
horizon
the
baby
is
not
very
strong
but
with
the
care
and
devotion
of
the
grandmother
out
in
the
country
air
it
is
sure
to
recover
the
grandmother
unexpectedly
arrives
announcing
that
she
has
brought
the
baby
back
to
town
it
is
very
ill
and
she
has
consulted
a
specialist
who
has
promised
to
come
at
once
to
examine
the
child
presently
the
doctor
arrives
he
insists
that
the
wet
nurse
be
dismissed
immediately
as
the
child
would
infect
her
and
she
in
return
would
infect
her
own
husband
and
baby
is
scandalized
what
leave
her
precious
grandchild
rob
him
of
the
milk
he
needs
if
there
is
one
way
to
save
its
life
it
is
to
give
it
every
possible
attention
and
you
want
me
to
treat
it
in
a
way
that
you
doctors
condemn
even
for
healthy
children
you
think
i
will
let
her
die
like
that
oh
i
shall
take
good
care
she
does
not
neglect
the
one
single
thing
that
can
save
her
it
would
be
criminal
as
for
the
nurse
we
will
indemnify
her
we
will
do
everything
in
our
power
everything
but
that
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
found
myself
in
this
situation
and
i
must
begin
by
telling
you
that
parents
who
have
refused
to
be
guided
by
my
advice
have
invariably
repented
of
it
most
bitterly
you
propose
to
profit
by
her
ignorance
and
her
poverty
besides
she
could
obtain
the
assistance
of
the
court
you
can
convince
yourself
in
one
or
two
cases
the
parents
have
been
ordered
to
pay
a
yearly
pension
to
the
nurse
in
the
others
sums
of
money
varying
from
three
to
eight
thousand
francs
if
we
had
to
fight
an
action
we
should
retain
the
very
best
lawyer
on
our
side
thank
heaven
we
are
rich
enough
no
doubt
he
would
make
it
appear
doubtful
whether
the
child
caught
this
disease
from
the
nurse
rather
than
the
nurse
from
the
child
indeed
what
matters
a
peasant
woman
they
are
so
numerous
in
vain
the
doctor
tries
to
convince
that
it
is
not
a
question
of
money
it
is
a
question
of
humanity
of
decency
he
would
not
and
could
not
be
a
party
to
such
a
crime
after
the
doctor
leaves
to
examine
the
child
and
her
worthy
son
clinch
the
bargain
with
the
unsuspecting
and
ignorant
servant
they
tell
her
that
the
baby
has
a
cold
which
it
might
communicate
to
her
the
poor
peasant
girl
had
lived
in
the
cold
all
her
life
and
as
she
justly
says
we
of
the
country
are
not
as
delicate
as
the
parisian
ladies
she
realizes
that
a
thousand
francs
would
mean
a
great
fortune
to
her
and
that
it
would
help
her
people
to
pay
the
mortgage
and
become
independent
she
consents
to
stay
and
signs
away
her
health
the
doctor
returns
with
the
dreaded
news
that
the
child
has
congenital
syphilis
he
informs
them
that
with
care
and
patience
the
child
might
be
cured
but
that
it
will
have
to
be
put
on
bottle
milk
because
otherwise
it
would
be
disastrous
to
the
nurse
when
he
is
told
that
the
nurse
has
consented
to
remain
he
grows
indignant
declaring
you
must
not
ask
me
to
sacrifice
the
health
of
a
young
and
strong
woman
to
that
of
a
sickly
infant
i
will
be
no
party
to
giving
this
woman
a
disease
that
would
embitter
the
lives
of
her
whole
family
and
almost
certainly
render
her
sterile
besides
i
can
not
even
do
it
from
a
legal
standpoint
you
do
not
consent
to
have
the
child
fed
by
hand
i
shall
either
speak
to
the
nurse
or
give
up
the
but
there
is
no
need
for
the
doctor
to
interfere
fortunately
for
the
servant
she
discovers
the
miserable
transaction
she
learns
from
the
butler
the
real
condition
of
the
child
and
announces
to
the
duponts
that
she
must
refuse
to
stay
i
know
your
brat
is
going
to
live
i
know
it
rotten
through
and
through
because
its
father
got
a
beastly
disease
that
he
caught
from
some
woman
of
the
streets
at
this
terrible
moment
the
unsuspecting
and
mother
arrives
she
overhears
the
horrible
news
and
falls
screaming
to
the
floor
the
last
act
takes
place
in
the
hospital
the
refuge
of
the
unfortunate
victims
of
poverty
ignorance
and
false
morality
the
deputy
is
announced
the
doctor
is
overjoyed
because
he
believes
that
the
representative
of
the
people
comes
to
inform
himself
of
the
causes
of
the
widespread
misery
but
he
is
mistaken
is
the
of
he
wants
to
secure
the
signature
of
the
doctor
as
evidence
in
the
divorce
sought
by
his
daughter
i
regret
that
i
am
unable
to
furnish
you
with
such
a
certificate
the
rule
of
professional
secrecy
is
absolute
and
i
may
add
that
even
were
i
free
i
should
refuse
your
request
i
should
regret
having
helped
you
to
obtain
a
divorce
it
would
be
in
your
daughter
own
interest
that
i
should
refuse
you
ask
me
for
a
certificate
in
order
to
prove
to
the
court
that
your
has
contracted
syphilis
you
do
not
consider
that
in
doing
so
you
will
publicly
acknowledge
that
your
daughter
has
been
exposed
to
the
infection
do
you
suppose
that
after
that
your
daughter
is
likely
to
find
a
second
husband
do
you
think
that
this
poor
little
thing
has
not
been
unlucky
enough
in
her
start
in
life
she
has
been
blighted
physically
you
wish
besides
indelibly
to
stamp
her
with
the
legal
proof
of
congenital
syphilis
then
what
am
i
to
do
forgive
when
the
marriage
was
proposed
you
doubtless
made
inquiries
concerning
your
future
income
you
investigated
his
securities
you
satisfied
yourself
as
to
his
character
you
only
omitted
one
point
but
it
was
the
most
important
of
all
you
made
no
inquiries
concerning
his
health
no
i
did
not
do
that
it
is
not
the
custom
i
think
a
law
should
be
passed
no
no
we
want
no
new
laws
there
are
too
many
already
all
that
is
needed
is
for
people
to
understand
the
nature
of
this
disease
rather
better
it
would
soon
become
the
custom
for
a
man
who
proposed
for
a
girl
hand
to
add
to
the
other
things
for
which
he
is
asked
a
medical
statement
of
bodily
fitness
which
would
make
it
certain
that
he
did
not
bring
this
plague
into
the
family
with
him
well
there
is
one
last
argument
which
since
i
must
i
will
put
to
you
are
you
yourself
without
sin
that
you
are
so
relentless
to
others
i
have
never
had
any
shameful
disease
sir
i
was
not
asking
you
that
i
was
asking
you
if
you
had
never
exposed
yourself
to
catching
one
ah
you
see
then
it
is
not
virtue
that
has
saved
you
it
is
luck
few
things
exasperate
me
more
than
that
term
shameful
disease
which
you
used
just
now
this
disease
is
like
all
other
diseases
it
is
one
of
our
afflictions
there
is
no
shame
in
being
wretched
even
if
one
deserves
to
be
so
come
come
let
us
have
a
little
plain
speaking
i
should
like
to
know
how
many
of
these
rigid
moralists
who
are
so
shocked
with
their
prudery
that
they
dare
not
mention
the
name
syphilis
or
when
they
bring
themselves
to
speak
of
it
do
so
with
expressions
of
every
sort
of
disgust
and
treat
its
victims
as
criminals
have
never
run
the
risk
of
contracting
it
themselves
it
is
those
alone
who
have
the
right
to
talk
how
many
do
you
think
there
are
four
out
of
a
thousand
well
leave
those
four
aside
between
all
the
rest
and
those
who
catch
the
disease
there
is
no
difference
but
chance
and
by
heavens
those
who
escape
wo
get
much
sympathy
from
me
the
others
at
least
have
paid
their
fine
of
suffering
and
remorse
while
they
have
gone
scot
free
let
have
done
if
you
please
once
for
all
with
this
sort
of
hypocrisy
the
doctor
who
is
not
only
a
sincere
scientist
but
also
a
humanitarian
realizes
that
as
things
are
no
one
is
exempt
from
the
possibility
of
contracting
an
infection
that
those
who
are
responsible
for
the
spread
of
the
disease
are
they
who
constantly
excuse
themselves
with
the
inane
i
did
not
know
as
if
ignorance
were
not
the
crime
of
all
crimes
the
doctor
demonstrates
to
a
number
of
cases
under
his
observation
all
of
them
the
result
of
ignorance
and
of
poverty
there
is
for
instance
the
woman
whose
husband
died
of
the
disease
he
did
know
so
he
infected
her
she
on
the
other
hand
is
poor
and
can
not
afford
the
treatment
she
needs
a
private
physician
is
beyond
her
means
and
she
has
too
much
pride
to
stand
the
indignities
heaped
upon
the
poor
who
are
at
the
mercy
of
dispensaries
and
charity
therefore
she
neglects
her
disease
and
perhaps
is
unconsciously
instrumental
in
infecting
others
then
there
is
the
man
whose
young
son
has
contracted
the
disease
his
father
did
know
and
therefore
he
did
not
inform
his
son
as
a
result
of
which
the
boy
became
half
paralyzed
we
are
small
we
have
regularly
bled
ourselves
in
order
to
send
him
to
college
and
now
i
only
wish
the
same
thing
may
happen
to
others
it
was
at
the
very
college
gates
that
my
poor
boy
was
got
hold
of
by
one
of
these
women
is
it
right
sir
that
that
should
be
allowed
are
there
enough
police
to
prevent
children
of
fifteen
from
being
seduced
like
that
i
ask
is
it
right
the
poor
man
in
his
ignorance
did
not
know
that
these
women
are
the
most
victimized
as
demonstrated
by
the
doctor
himself
in
the
case
of
the
poor
girl
of
the
street
she
was
both
ignorant
and
innocent
when
she
found
a
place
as
domestic
servant
and
was
seduced
by
her
master
then
she
was
kicked
out
into
the
street
and
in
her
endless
search
for
work
found
every
door
closed
in
her
face
she
was
compelled
to
stifle
her
feeling
of
motherhood
to
send
her
baby
to
a
foundling
asylum
and
finally
in
order
to
exist
become
a
if
in
return
she
infected
the
men
who
came
to
her
including
her
erstwhile
seducer
she
was
only
paying
back
in
a
small
measure
what
society
had
done
to
her
the
injury
the
bitterness
the
misery
and
tears
heaped
upon
her
by
a
cruel
and
world
it
is
to
be
expected
that
a
political
representative
of
the
people
like
should
suggest
the
same
stereotyped
measures
as
his
predecessors
legal
enactments
prosecution
imprisonment
but
the
doctor
a
real
social
student
knows
that
the
true
remedy
lies
in
a
change
of
our
ways
syphilis
must
cease
to
be
treated
like
a
mysterious
evil
the
very
name
of
which
can
not
be
pronounced
people
ought
to
be
taught
that
there
is
nothing
immoral
in
the
act
that
reproduces
life
by
means
of
love
but
for
the
benefit
of
our
children
we
organize
round
about
it
a
gigantic
conspiracy
of
silence
a
respectable
man
will
take
his
son
and
daughter
to
one
of
these
grand
music
halls
where
they
will
hear
things
of
the
most
loathsome
description
but
he
wo
let
them
hear
a
word
spoken
seriously
on
the
subject
of
the
great
act
of
love
the
mystery
and
humbug
in
which
physical
facts
are
enveloped
ought
to
be
swept
away
and
young
men
be
given
some
pride
in
the
creative
power
with
which
each
one
of
us
is
endowed
in
other
words
what
we
need
is
more
general
enlightenment
greater
frankness
and
above
all
different
social
and
economic
conditions
the
revolutionary
significance
of
damaged
goods
consists
in
the
lesson
that
not
syphilis
but
the
causes
that
lead
to
it
are
the
terrible
curse
of
society
those
who
rant
against
syphilis
and
clamor
for
more
laws
for
marriage
certificates
for
registration
and
segregation
do
not
touch
even
the
surface
of
the
evil
brieux
is
among
the
very
few
modern
dramatists
who
go
to
the
bottom
of
this
question
by
insisting
on
a
complete
social
and
economic
change
which
alone
can
free
us
from
the
scourge
of
syphilis
and
other
social
plagues
maternity
motherhood
is
on
the
lips
of
every
every
social
patchworker
and
political
climber
it
is
so
much
prated
about
that
one
is
led
to
believe
that
motherhood
in
its
present
condition
is
a
force
for
good
it
therefore
required
a
free
spirit
combined
with
great
dramatic
power
to
tear
the
mask
off
the
lying
face
of
motherhood
that
we
may
see
that
whatever
its
possibilities
in
a
free
future
motherhood
is
a
sickly
tree
setting
forth
diseased
branches
for
its
sake
thousands
of
women
are
being
sacrificed
and
children
sent
into
a
cold
and
barren
world
without
the
slightest
provision
for
their
physical
and
mental
needs
it
was
left
to
brieux
to
inscribe
with
letters
of
fire
the
crying
shame
of
the
motherhood
of
a
provincial
lawyer
and
an
unscrupulous
climber
for
political
success
represents
the
typical
pillar
of
society
he
believes
implicitly
in
the
supremacy
of
god
over
the
destiny
of
man
he
swears
by
the
state
and
the
army
and
cringes
before
the
power
of
money
naturally
he
is
the
champion
of
large
families
as
essential
to
the
welfare
of
society
and
of
motherhood
as
the
most
sacred
and
sole
function
of
woman
he
is
the
father
of
three
children
all
of
whom
are
in
a
precarious
condition
he
resents
the
idea
that
society
ought
to
take
care
of
the
children
already
in
existence
rather
than
continue
indiscriminately
breeding
more
himself
wants
more
children
in
vain
his
wife
weakened
by
repeated
pregnancies
pleads
with
him
for
a
respite
listen
julien
since
we
are
talking
about
this
i
wanted
to
tell
you
i
have
had
much
leisure
since
our
marriage
we
have
not
been
able
to
take
advantage
of
a
single
one
of
your
holidays
i
really
have
a
right
to
a
little
rest
consider
we
have
not
had
any
time
to
know
one
another
or
to
love
one
another
besides
remember
that
we
already
have
to
find
dowries
for
three
girls
i
tell
you
this
is
going
to
be
a
boy
a
boy
is
expensive
we
are
going
to
be
rich
how
luck
may
come
in
several
ways
i
may
stay
in
the
civil
service
and
get
promoted
quickly
i
may
go
back
to
the
bar
i
am
certain
we
shall
be
rich
after
all
it
not
much
good
your
saying
so
if
i
say
yes
evidently
my
consent
was
asked
for
before
i
was
given
a
husband
but
my
consent
is
not
asked
for
before
i
am
given
a
child
this
is
slavery
yes
after
all
you
are
disposing
of
my
health
my
sufferings
my
life
of
a
year
of
my
existence
calmly
without
consulting
me
do
i
do
it
out
of
selfishness
do
you
suppose
i
am
not
a
most
unhappy
husband
all
the
time
i
have
a
future
mother
at
my
side
instead
of
a
loving
wife
a
father
is
a
man
all
the
same
rubbish
you
evidently
take
me
for
a
fool
i
know
what
you
do
at
those
times
do
deny
it
you
must
see
that
i
know
all
about
it
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
the
name
of
the
person
you
go
to
see
over
at
villeneuve
while
i
am
nursing
or
a
future
mother
as
you
call
it
we
had
better
say
no
more
about
it
goes
off
to
his
political
meeting
to
proclaim
to
his
constituency
the
sacredness
of
motherhood
the
deepest
and
highest
function
of
woman
has
a
younger
sister
a
girl
of
eighteen
their
parents
being
dead
takes
the
place
of
the
mother
she
is
passionately
fond
of
her
little
sister
and
makes
it
her
purpose
to
keep
the
girl
sheltered
and
protected
from
the
outside
world
arrives
and
announces
with
great
enthusiasm
that
the
son
of
the
wealthy
bernins
has
declared
his
love
and
asked
her
to
marry
him
and
that
his
mother
is
coming
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
does
arrive
but
not
for
the
purpose
poor
had
hoped
rather
is
it
to
tell
that
her
son
can
not
marry
the
girl
oh
not
because
she
is
beautiful
pure
or
attractive
indeed
not
herself
says
that
her
son
could
not
wish
for
a
more
suitable
match
but
then
she
has
no
money
and
her
son
must
succeed
in
the
world
he
must
acquire
social
standing
and
position
that
can
not
be
had
without
money
when
pleads
with
her
that
after
all
the
bernins
themselves
had
begun
at
the
bottom
and
that
it
did
not
prevent
their
being
happy
replies
no
no
we
are
not
happy
because
we
have
worn
ourselves
out
hunting
after
happiness
we
wanted
to
get
on
and
we
got
on
but
what
a
price
we
paid
for
it
first
when
we
were
both
earning
wages
our
life
was
one
long
drudgery
of
petty
economy
and
meanness
when
we
set
up
on
our
own
account
we
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
trickery
of
enmity
of
lying
flattering
the
customers
and
always
in
terror
of
bankruptcy
oh
i
know
the
road
to
fortune
it
means
tears
lies
envy
hate
one
suffers
and
one
makes
other
people
suffer
i
have
had
to
go
through
it
my
children
sha
we
only
had
two
children
we
meant
only
to
have
one
having
two
we
had
to
be
doubly
hard
upon
ourselves
instead
of
a
husband
and
wife
helping
one
another
we
have
been
partners
spying
upon
one
another
calling
one
another
to
account
for
every
little
expenditure
or
stupidity
and
on
our
very
pillows
disputing
about
our
business
that
how
we
got
rich
and
now
we
ca
enjoy
our
money
because
we
do
know
how
to
use
it
and
we
are
happy
because
our
old
age
is
made
bitter
by
the
memories
and
the
rancor
left
by
the
old
bad
days
because
we
have
suffered
too
much
and
hated
too
much
my
children
shall
not
go
through
this
i
endured
it
that
they
might
be
spared
learning
the
price
has
paid
for
her
wealth
we
need
not
blame
her
for
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
entreaties
of
in
behalf
of
her
sister
neither
can
be
held
responsible
for
her
stupidity
in
keeping
her
sister
in
ignorance
until
she
was
incapable
of
protecting
herself
when
the
occasion
demanded
poor
one
of
the
many
offered
up
to
the
insatiable
monster
of
ignorance
and
social
convention
when
is
informed
of
the
result
of
visit
the
girl
grows
hysterical
and
learns
that
her
little
sister
is
about
to
become
a
mother
under
the
pretext
of
love
and
marriage
young
pampered
has
taken
advantage
of
the
girl
inexperience
and
innocence
in
her
despair
rushes
out
in
search
of
her
lover
only
to
be
repelled
by
him
in
a
vulgar
and
cruel
manner
she
then
attempts
suicide
by
trying
to
throw
herself
under
the
train
which
is
to
carry
off
her
worthless
seducer
she
is
rescued
by
the
faithful
nurse
and
brought
back
to
her
anxious
sister
in
great
excitement
relates
you
never
guess
what
he
said
he
got
angry
and
he
began
to
abuse
me
he
said
he
guessed
what
i
was
up
to
that
i
wanted
to
make
a
scandal
to
force
him
to
marry
me
oh
he
spared
me
nothing
to
force
him
to
marry
me
because
he
was
rich
and
when
that
made
me
furious
he
threatened
to
call
the
police
i
ought
to
have
left
him
run
away
come
home
ought
i
but
i
could
believe
it
of
him
all
at
once
like
that
and
i
could
go
away
while
i
had
any
hope
as
long
as
i
was
holding
to
his
arm
it
was
as
if
i
was
engaged
when
he
was
gone
i
should
only
be
a
miserable
ruined
girl
like
dozens
of
others
my
life
was
at
stake
and
to
save
myself
i
went
down
into
the
very
lowest
depths
of
vileness
and
cowardice
i
cried
i
implored
i
lost
all
shame
what
he
said
then
i
can
not
tell
you
not
even
you
it
was
too
much
too
much
i
did
not
understand
at
first
it
was
only
afterwards
coming
back
going
over
all
his
words
that
i
made
out
what
he
meant
then
he
rushed
to
the
train
and
jumped
into
a
carriage
and
almost
crushed
my
fingers
in
the
door
and
he
went
and
hid
behind
his
mother
and
she
threatened
too
to
have
me
arrested
i
wish
i
was
dead
lucie
dear
i
do
want
to
go
through
all
that
coming
i
am
too
little
i
am
too
weak
i
too
young
to
bear
it
really
i
the
strength
but
has
faith
in
her
husband
in
all
the
years
of
their
married
life
she
has
heard
him
proclaim
from
the
very
housetops
that
motherhood
is
the
most
sacred
function
of
woman
that
the
state
needs
large
numbers
that
commerce
and
the
army
require
an
increase
of
the
population
and
the
government
commands
you
to
further
this
end
to
the
best
of
your
ability
each
one
of
you
in
his
own
commune
she
has
heard
her
husband
repeat
over
and
over
again
that
the
woman
who
refuses
to
abide
by
the
command
of
god
and
the
laws
to
become
a
mother
is
immoral
is
criminal
surely
he
would
understand
the
tragedy
of
who
had
been
placed
in
this
condition
not
through
her
own
fault
but
because
she
had
been
confiding
and
trusting
in
the
promise
of
the
man
surely
would
come
to
the
rescue
of
would
help
and
comfort
her
in
her
trying
and
difficult
moment
but
like
many
wives
does
not
know
her
husband
she
does
not
know
that
a
man
who
is
so
hidebound
by
statutes
and
codes
can
not
have
human
compassion
and
that
he
will
not
stand
by
the
little
girl
who
has
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
does
not
know
but
she
is
soon
to
learn
the
truth
i
tell
you
annette
is
the
victim
of
this
wretch
if
you
are
going
to
do
nothing
but
insult
her
we
had
better
stop
discussing
the
matter
i
am
in
a
nice
fix
now
there
is
nothing
left
for
us
but
to
pack
our
trunks
and
be
off
i
am
done
for
ruined
smashed
i
tell
you
if
she
was
caught
red
handed
stealing
the
wreck
be
more
complete
we
must
make
some
excuse
we
will
invent
an
aunt
or
cousin
who
has
invited
her
to
stay
i
will
find
a
decent
house
for
her
in
paris
to
go
to
she
be
all
right
there
when
the
time
comes
she
can
put
the
child
out
to
nurse
in
the
country
and
come
back
to
us
you
seriously
propose
to
send
that
poor
child
to
paris
where
she
does
know
a
soul
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
will
go
to
paris
myself
if
necessary
there
are
special
boarding
houses
very
respectable
ones
i
inquire
of
course
without
letting
out
that
it
is
for
anyone
i
know
and
i
pay
what
is
necessary
what
more
can
you
want
just
when
the
child
is
most
in
need
of
every
care
you
propose
to
send
her
off
alone
alone
do
you
understand
alone
to
tear
her
away
from
here
put
her
into
a
train
and
send
her
off
to
paris
like
a
sick
animal
you
want
to
get
rid
of
if
i
consented
to
that
i
should
feel
that
i
was
as
bad
as
the
man
who
seduced
her
be
honest
julien
remember
it
is
in
our
interest
you
propose
to
sacrifice
her
we
shall
gain
peace
and
quiet
at
the
price
of
her
loneliness
and
despair
to
save
ourselves
serious
troubles
i
admit
we
are
to
abandon
this
child
to
strangers
away
from
all
love
and
care
and
comfort
without
a
friend
to
put
kind
arms
around
her
and
let
her
sob
her
grief
away
i
implore
you
julien
i
entreat
you
for
our
children
sake
do
keep
me
from
her
do
ask
me
to
do
this
shameful
thing
there
would
have
been
no
question
of
misery
if
she
had
behaved
herself
she
is
this
man
victim
but
she
wo
go
you
have
to
drive
her
out
as
you
drove
out
the
servant
and
then
after
that
she
is
to
let
her
child
go
to
stifle
her
strongest
instinct
to
silence
the
cry
of
love
that
consoles
us
all
for
the
tortures
we
have
to
go
through
to
turn
away
her
eyes
and
say
take
him
away
i
do
want
him
and
at
that
price
she
is
to
be
forgiven
for
another
person
crime
then
that
is
society
welcome
to
the
new
born
child
to
the
child
born
outside
of
marriage
yes
if
it
for
that
there
would
soon
be
nothing
but
illegitimate
births
it
is
to
preserve
the
family
that
society
condemns
the
natural
child
you
say
you
want
a
larger
number
of
births
and
at
the
same
time
you
say
to
women
no
motherhood
without
marriage
and
no
marriage
without
money
as
long
as
you
not
changed
that
all
your
circulars
will
be
met
with
shouts
of
derision
half
from
hate
half
from
pity
if
you
drive
annette
out
i
shall
go
with
her
and
go
out
into
the
world
as
girls
they
have
been
taught
a
little
of
everything
and
not
much
of
anything
they
try
all
kinds
of
work
to
enable
them
to
make
a
living
but
though
they
toil
hard
and
long
hours
they
barely
earn
enough
for
a
meager
existence
as
long
as
condition
is
not
noticeable
life
is
bearable
but
soon
everybody
remarks
her
state
she
and
are
driven
from
place
to
place
in
her
despair
does
what
many
girls
in
her
position
have
done
before
her
and
will
do
after
her
so
long
as
the
brignacs
and
their
morality
are
dominant
she
visits
a
midwife
and
one
more
victim
is
added
to
the
large
number
slaughtered
upon
the
altar
of
morality
the
last
act
is
in
the
court
room
the
midwife
is
on
trial
for
criminal
abortion
with
her
are
a
number
of
women
whose
names
have
been
found
on
her
register
bit
by
bit
we
learn
the
whole
tragedy
of
each
of
the
defendants
we
see
all
the
sordidness
of
poverty
the
inability
to
procure
the
bare
necessities
of
life
and
the
dread
of
the
unwelcome
child
a
schoolmistress
although
earning
a
few
hundred
francs
and
living
with
her
husband
is
compelled
to
have
an
abortion
performed
because
another
child
would
mean
hunger
for
all
of
them
we
just
managed
to
get
along
by
being
most
careful
and
several
times
we
cut
down
expenses
it
did
not
seem
possible
to
cut
down
a
third
child
coming
upset
everything
we
could
have
lived
we
should
have
all
starved
besides
the
inspectors
and
directresses
do
like
us
to
have
many
children
especially
if
we
nurse
them
ourselves
they
told
me
to
hide
myself
when
i
was
suckling
the
last
one
i
only
had
ten
minutes
to
do
it
in
at
the
recreation
at
ten
and
at
two
and
when
my
mother
brought
baby
to
me
i
had
to
shut
myself
up
with
him
in
a
dark
closet
the
couple
stand
before
the
bar
to
defend
themselves
against
the
charge
of
criminal
abortion
has
been
out
of
work
for
a
long
time
and
is
driven
by
misery
to
drink
he
is
known
to
the
police
as
a
disreputable
character
one
of
his
sons
is
serving
a
sentence
for
theft
and
a
daughter
is
a
woman
of
the
streets
but
is
a
thinking
man
he
proves
that
his
earnings
at
best
are
not
enough
to
supply
the
needs
of
an
already
large
family
the
daily
nourishment
of
five
children
consists
of
a
loaf
soup
of
vegetables
and
dripping
and
a
stew
which
costs
centimes
total
this
is
the
expenditure
of
the
father
return
ticket
for
tram
tobacco
dinner
the
rent
clothing
for
the
whole
family
and
boots
pairs
of
boots
for
the
children
at
each
for
the
parents
at
total
again
total
for
the
year
who
is
an
exceptional
workman
earns
a
month
that
is
to
say
a
year
there
is
therefore
an
annual
deficit
of
provided
keeps
at
work
all
the
time
which
never
happens
in
the
life
of
a
workingman
under
such
circumstances
no
one
need
be
surprised
that
one
of
his
children
is
imprisoned
for
theft
and
the
other
is
walking
the
streets
while
himself
is
driven
to
drink
when
we
began
to
get
short
in
the
house
my
wife
and
i
started
to
quarrel
every
time
a
child
came
we
were
mad
at
making
it
worse
for
the
others
and
so
i
ended
up
in
the
saloon
it
warm
there
and
you
ca
hear
the
children
crying
nor
the
mother
complaining
and
besides
when
you
have
drink
in
you
you
forget
and
that
how
we
got
poorer
and
poorer
my
fault
if
you
like
our
last
child
was
a
cripple
he
was
born
in
starvation
and
his
mother
was
worn
out
and
they
nursed
him
and
they
nursed
him
and
they
nursed
him
they
did
not
leave
him
a
minute
they
made
him
live
in
spite
of
himself
and
they
let
the
other
children
the
strong
ones
go
to
the
bad
with
half
the
money
and
the
fuss
they
wasted
on
the
cripple
they
could
have
made
fine
fellows
of
all
the
others
i
have
to
add
that
all
this
is
not
my
fault
my
husband
and
i
worked
like
beasts
we
did
without
every
kind
of
pleasure
to
try
and
bring
up
our
children
if
we
had
wanted
to
slave
more
i
declare
to
you
we
could
have
done
it
and
now
that
we
have
given
our
lives
for
them
the
oldest
is
in
hospital
ruined
and
done
for
because
he
worked
in
a
dangerous
trade
as
they
call
it
there
are
too
many
people
in
the
world
my
little
girl
had
to
choose
between
starvation
and
the
street
i
only
a
poor
woman
and
i
know
what
it
means
to
have
nothing
to
eat
so
i
forgave
her
thus
also
understands
that
it
is
a
crime
to
add
one
more
victim
to
those
who
are
born
ill
and
for
whom
society
has
no
place
then
faces
the
court
who
loved
her
sister
too
well
and
who
driven
by
the
same
conditions
that
killed
has
also
been
compelled
to
undergo
an
abortion
rather
than
have
a
fourth
child
by
the
man
she
did
not
love
any
more
like
the
and
the
she
is
dragged
before
the
bar
of
justice
to
explain
her
crime
while
her
husband
who
had
forced
both
and
out
of
the
house
has
meanwhile
risen
to
a
high
position
as
a
supporter
of
the
state
with
his
favorite
slogan
motherhood
is
the
highest
function
of
woman
finally
the
midwife
is
called
upon
for
her
defense
a
girl
came
to
me
one
day
she
was
a
servant
she
had
been
seduced
by
her
master
i
refused
to
do
what
she
asked
me
to
do
she
went
and
drowned
herself
another
i
refused
to
help
was
brought
up
before
you
here
for
infanticide
then
when
the
others
came
i
said
yes
i
have
prevented
many
a
suicide
and
many
a
crime
it
is
not
likely
that
the
venerable
judge
the
state
attorney
or
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
can
see
in
a
greater
benefactress
to
society
than
they
any
more
than
they
can
grasp
the
deep
importance
of
the
concluding
words
of
the
counsel
for
the
defense
in
this
great
social
tragedy
for
the
their
crime
is
not
an
individual
crime
it
is
a
social
crime
it
is
a
crime
against
nature
it
is
a
revolt
against
nature
and
with
all
the
warmth
of
a
heart
melted
by
pity
with
all
the
indignation
of
my
outraged
reason
i
look
for
that
glorious
hour
of
liberation
when
some
master
mind
shall
discover
for
us
the
means
of
having
only
the
children
we
need
and
desire
release
forever
from
the
prison
of
hypocrisy
and
absolve
us
from
the
profanation
of
love
that
would
indeed
be
a
conquest
of
nature
savage
nature
which
pours
out
life
with
culpable
profusion
and
sees
it
disappear
with
indifference
surely
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
revolutionary
significance
of
maternity
the
demand
that
woman
must
be
given
means
to
prevent
conception
of
undesired
and
unloved
children
that
she
must
become
free
and
strong
to
choose
the
father
of
her
child
and
to
decide
the
number
of
children
she
is
to
bring
into
the
world
and
under
what
conditions
that
is
the
only
kind
of
motherhood
which
can
endure
the
english
drama
george
bernard
shaw
i
am
not
an
ordinary
playwright
in
general
practice
i
am
a
specialist
in
immoral
and
heretical
plays
my
reputation
has
been
gained
by
my
persistent
struggle
to
force
the
public
to
reconsider
its
morals
in
particular
i
regard
much
current
morality
as
to
economic
and
sexual
relations
as
disastrously
wrong
and
i
regard
certain
doctrines
of
the
christian
religion
as
understood
in
england
with
abhorrence
i
write
plays
with
the
deliberate
object
of
converting
the
nation
to
my
opinions
in
these
matters
this
confession
of
faith
should
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
place
of
george
bernard
shaw
in
modern
dramatic
art
yet
strange
to
say
he
is
among
the
most
doubted
of
his
time
that
is
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
humor
generally
serves
merely
to
amuse
touching
only
the
lighter
side
of
life
but
there
is
a
kind
of
humor
that
fills
laughter
with
tears
a
humor
that
eats
into
the
soul
like
acid
leaving
marks
often
deeper
than
those
made
by
the
tragic
form
there
is
another
reason
why
shaw
sincerity
is
regarded
lightly
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
difference
of
his
scope
as
propagandist
and
as
artist
as
the
propagandist
shaw
is
limited
dogmatic
and
set
indeed
the
most
zealous
puritan
could
not
be
more
antagonistic
to
social
theories
differing
from
his
own
but
the
artist
if
he
is
sincere
at
all
must
go
to
life
as
the
source
of
his
inspiration
and
life
is
beyond
dogmas
beyond
the
house
of
commons
beyond
even
the
eternal
and
irrevocable
law
of
the
materialistic
conception
of
history
if
then
the
socialist
propagandist
shaw
is
often
lost
in
the
artist
shaw
it
is
not
because
he
lacks
sincerity
but
because
life
will
not
be
curtailed
it
may
be
contended
that
shaw
is
much
more
the
propagandist
than
the
artist
because
he
paints
in
loud
colors
but
that
is
rather
because
of
the
indolence
of
the
human
mind
especially
of
the
mind
which
has
settled
down
snugly
to
the
notion
of
its
purity
justice
and
charity
so
that
naught
but
the
strongest
current
of
light
will
make
it
wince
in
warren
profession
and
major
barbara
george
bernard
shaw
has
accomplished
even
more
he
has
pulled
off
the
mask
of
purity
and
christian
kindness
that
we
may
see
their
hidden
viciousness
at
work
warren
profession
warren
is
engaged
in
a
profession
which
has
existed
through
all
the
ages
it
was
at
home
in
egypt
played
an
important
rÃ´le
in
greece
and
rome
formed
one
of
the
influential
guilds
in
the
middle
ages
and
has
been
one
of
the
main
sources
of
income
for
the
christian
church
but
it
was
left
to
modern
times
to
make
of
warren
profession
a
tremendous
social
factor
ministering
to
the
needs
of
man
in
every
station
of
life
from
the
brownstone
mansion
to
the
hovel
from
the
highest
official
to
the
poorest
drag
time
was
when
the
warrens
were
looked
upon
as
possessed
by
the
devil
lewd
depraved
creatures
who
would
not
even
if
they
had
the
choice
engage
in
any
other
profession
because
they
are
vicious
at
heart
and
should
therefore
be
held
up
to
condemnation
and
obloquy
and
while
we
continue
to
drive
them
from
pillar
to
post
while
we
still
punish
them
as
criminals
and
deny
them
the
simplest
humanities
one
gives
even
to
the
dumb
beast
the
light
turned
on
this
subject
by
men
like
george
bernard
shaw
has
helped
to
expose
the
lie
of
inherent
evil
tendencies
and
natural
depravity
instead
we
learn
do
you
think
i
did
what
i
did
because
i
liked
it
or
thought
it
right
or
would
rather
have
gone
to
college
and
been
a
lady
if
i
had
the
chance
oh
it
easy
to
talk
very
easy
is
it
here
would
you
like
to
know
what
my
circumstances
were
know
what
your
was
no
you
do
i
do
she
called
herself
a
widow
and
had
a
shop
down
by
the
mint
and
kept
herself
and
four
daughters
out
of
it
two
of
us
were
sisters
that
was
me
and
liz
and
we
were
both
good
looking
and
well
made
i
suppose
our
father
was
a
well
fed
man
mother
pretended
he
was
a
gentleman
but
i
do
know
the
other
two
were
only
half
sisters
undersized
ugly
starved
hard
working
honest
poor
creatures
liz
and
i
would
have
half
murdered
them
if
mother
half
murdered
us
to
keep
our
hands
off
them
they
were
the
respectable
ones
well
what
did
they
get
by
their
respectability
i
tell
you
one
of
them
worked
in
a
whitelead
factory
twelve
hours
a
day
for
nine
shillings
a
week
until
she
died
of
lead
poisoning
she
only
expected
to
get
her
hands
a
little
paralyzed
but
she
died
the
other
was
always
held
up
to
us
as
a
model
because
she
married
a
government
laborer
in
the
deptford
victualling
yard
and
kept
his
room
and
the
three
children
neat
and
tidy
on
eighteen
shillings
a
week
until
he
took
to
drink
that
was
worth
being
respectable
for
was
it
did
you
and
your
sister
think
so
liz
did
i
can
tell
you
she
had
more
spirit
we
both
went
to
a
church
school
that
was
part
of
the
airs
we
gave
ourselves
to
be
superior
to
the
children
that
knew
nothing
and
went
nowhere
and
we
stayed
there
until
liz
went
out
one
night
and
never
came
back
i
knew
the
schoolmistress
thought
i
soon
follow
her
example
for
the
clergyman
was
always
warning
me
that
lizzie
end
by
jumping
off
waterloo
bridge
poor
fool
that
was
all
that
he
knew
about
it
but
i
was
more
afraid
of
the
whitelead
factory
than
i
was
of
the
river
and
so
would
you
have
been
in
my
place
that
clergyman
got
me
a
situation
as
a
scullery
maid
in
a
temperance
restaurant
where
they
sent
out
for
anything
you
liked
then
i
was
waitress
and
then
i
went
to
the
bar
at
waterloo
station
fourteen
hours
a
day
serving
drinks
and
washing
glasses
for
four
shillings
a
week
and
my
board
that
was
considered
a
great
promotion
for
me
well
one
cold
wretched
night
when
i
was
so
tired
i
could
hardly
keep
myself
awake
who
should
come
up
for
a
half
of
scotch
but
lizzie
in
a
long
fur
cloak
elegant
and
comfortable
with
a
lot
of
sovereigns
in
her
purse
my
aunt
lizzie
yes
she
living
down
at
winchester
now
close
to
the
cathedral
one
of
the
most
respectable
ladies
there
chaperones
girls
at
the
country
ball
if
you
please
no
river
for
liz
thank
you
you
remind
me
of
liz
a
little
she
was
a
business
woman
saved
money
from
the
beginning
never
let
herself
look
too
like
what
she
was
never
lost
her
head
or
threw
away
a
chance
when
she
saw
i
grown
up
she
said
to
me
across
the
bar
what
are
you
doing
there
you
little
fool
wearing
out
your
health
and
your
appearance
for
other
people
profit
liz
was
saving
money
then
to
take
a
house
for
herself
in
brussels
and
she
thought
we
two
could
save
faster
than
one
so
she
lent
me
some
money
and
gave
me
a
start
and
i
saved
steadily
and
first
paid
her
back
and
then
went
into
business
with
her
as
her
partner
why
should
i
have
done
it
the
house
in
brussels
was
real
high
class
a
much
better
place
for
a
woman
to
be
in
than
the
factory
where
anne
jane
got
poisoned
none
of
our
girls
were
ever
treated
as
i
was
treated
in
the
scullery
of
that
temperance
place
or
at
the
waterloo
bar
or
at
home
would
you
have
had
me
stay
in
them
and
become
a
old
drudge
before
i
was
forty
yes
saving
money
but
where
can
a
woman
get
the
money
to
save
in
any
other
business
could
you
save
out
of
four
shillings
a
week
and
keep
yourself
dressed
as
well
not
you
of
course
if
you
a
plain
woman
and
ca
earn
anything
more
or
if
you
have
a
turn
for
music
or
the
stage
or
newspaper
writing
that
different
but
neither
liz
nor
i
had
any
turn
for
such
things
all
we
had
was
our
appearance
and
our
turn
for
pleasing
men
do
you
think
we
were
such
fools
as
to
let
other
people
trade
in
our
good
looks
by
employing
us
as
or
barmaids
or
waitresses
when
we
could
trade
in
them
ourselves
and
get
all
the
profits
instead
of
starvation
wages
not
likely
everybody
dislikes
having
to
work
and
make
money
but
they
have
to
do
it
all
the
same
i
sure
i
often
pitied
a
poor
girl
tired
out
and
in
low
spirits
having
to
try
to
please
some
man
that
she
does
care
two
straws
for
some
fool
that
thinks
he
making
himself
agreeable
when
he
teasing
and
worrying
and
disgusting
a
woman
so
that
hardly
any
money
could
pay
her
for
putting
up
with
it
but
she
has
to
bear
with
disagreeables
and
take
the
rough
with
the
smooth
just
like
a
nurse
in
a
hospital
or
anyone
else
it
not
work
that
any
woman
would
do
for
pleasure
goodness
knows
though
to
hear
the
pious
people
talk
you
would
suppose
it
was
a
bed
of
roses
of
course
it
worth
while
to
a
poor
girl
if
she
can
resist
temptation
and
is
good
looking
and
and
sensible
it
far
better
than
any
other
employment
open
to
her
i
always
thought
that
ought
to
be
it
ca
be
right
vivie
that
there
should
be
better
opportunities
for
women
i
stick
to
that
it
wrong
but
it
so
right
or
wrong
and
a
girl
must
make
the
best
of
it
but
of
course
it
not
worth
while
for
a
lady
if
you
took
to
it
you
be
a
fool
but
i
should
have
been
a
fool
if
taken
to
anything
else
why
am
i
independent
and
able
to
give
my
daughter
a
education
when
other
women
that
had
just
as
good
opportunities
are
in
the
gutter
because
i
always
knew
how
to
respect
myself
and
control
myself
why
is
liz
looked
up
to
in
a
cathedral
town
the
same
reason
where
would
we
be
now
if
minded
the
clergyman
foolishness
scrubbing
floors
for
one
and
sixpence
a
day
and
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
the
workhouse
infirmary
do
you
be
led
astray
by
people
who
do
know
the
world
my
girl
the
only
way
for
a
woman
to
provide
for
herself
decently
is
for
her
to
be
good
to
some
man
that
can
afford
to
be
good
to
her
if
she
in
his
own
station
of
life
let
her
make
him
marry
her
but
if
she
far
beneath
him
she
ca
expect
it
why
should
she
it
would
be
for
her
own
happiness
ask
any
lady
in
london
society
that
has
daughters
and
she
tell
you
the
same
except
that
i
tell
you
straight
and
she
tell
you
crooked
all
the
difference
it
only
good
manners
to
be
ashamed
of
it
it
expected
from
a
woman
women
have
to
pretend
a
great
deal
that
they
do
feel
liz
used
to
be
angry
with
me
for
plumping
out
the
truth
about
it
she
used
to
say
that
when
every
woman
would
learn
enough
from
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
before
her
eyes
there
was
no
need
to
talk
about
it
to
her
but
then
liz
was
such
a
perfect
lady
she
had
the
true
instinct
of
it
while
i
was
always
a
bit
of
a
vulgarian
i
used
to
be
so
pleased
when
you
sent
me
your
photographs
to
see
that
you
were
growing
up
like
liz
you
just
her
determined
way
but
i
ca
stand
saying
one
thing
when
everyone
knows
i
mean
another
what
the
use
in
such
hypocrisy
if
people
arrange
the
world
that
way
for
women
there
no
use
pretending
that
it
arranged
the
other
way
i
never
was
a
bit
ashamed
really
i
consider
that
i
had
a
right
to
be
proud
that
we
managed
everything
so
respectably
and
never
had
a
word
against
us
and
that
the
girls
were
so
well
taken
care
of
some
of
them
did
very
well
one
of
them
married
an
ambassador
but
of
course
now
i
dare
talk
about
such
things
whatever
would
they
think
of
us
no
it
is
not
respectable
to
talk
about
these
things
because
respectability
can
not
face
the
truth
yet
everybody
knows
that
the
majority
of
women
if
they
wish
to
provide
for
themselves
decently
must
be
good
to
some
man
that
can
afford
to
be
good
to
them
the
only
difference
then
between
the
respectable
girl
and
is
hypocrisy
and
legal
sanction
uses
her
money
to
buy
back
her
reputation
from
the
church
and
society
the
respectable
girl
uses
the
sanction
of
the
church
to
buy
a
decent
income
legitimately
and
plays
her
game
without
the
sanction
of
either
hence
she
is
the
greatest
criminal
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
yet
is
no
less
human
than
most
other
women
in
fact
as
far
as
her
love
for
her
daughter
is
concerned
she
is
a
superior
sort
of
mother
that
her
daughter
may
not
have
to
face
the
same
alternative
as
she
slave
in
a
scullery
for
four
shillings
a
week
surrounds
the
girl
with
comfort
and
ease
gives
her
an
education
and
thereby
establishes
between
her
child
and
herself
an
abyss
which
nothing
can
bridge
few
respectable
mothers
would
do
as
much
for
their
daughters
however
remains
the
outcast
while
all
those
who
benefit
by
her
profession
including
even
her
daughter
move
in
the
best
circles
john
business
partner
who
has
invested
pounds
in
house
drawing
an
income
of
per
cent
out
of
it
in
the
worst
years
is
a
recognized
pillar
of
society
and
an
honored
member
of
his
class
why
not
the
fact
is
it
not
what
would
be
considered
exactly
a
business
in
my
set
the
county
set
you
know
not
that
there
is
any
mystery
about
it
do
think
that
of
course
you
know
by
your
mother
being
in
it
that
it
perfectly
straight
and
honest
i
known
her
for
many
years
and
i
can
say
of
her
that
she
cut
off
her
hands
sooner
than
touch
anything
that
was
not
what
it
ought
to
be
but
you
see
you
ca
mention
such
things
in
society
once
let
out
the
word
hotel
and
everybody
says
you
keep
a
you
would
like
people
to
say
that
of
your
mother
would
you
that
why
we
so
reserved
about
it
do
turn
up
your
nose
at
business
miss
vivie
where
would
your
newnhams
and
girtons
be
without
it
you
would
refuse
the
acquaintance
of
my
mother
cousin
the
duke
of
belgravia
because
some
of
the
rents
he
gets
are
earned
in
queer
ways
you
would
cut
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
i
suppose
because
the
ecclesiastical
commissioners
have
a
few
publicans
and
sinners
among
their
tenants
do
you
remember
your
crofts
scholarship
at
newnham
well
that
was
founded
by
my
brother
the
he
gets
his
per
cent
out
of
a
factory
with
girls
in
it
and
not
one
of
them
getting
wages
enough
to
live
on
how
d
ye
suppose
most
of
them
manage
ask
your
mother
and
do
you
expect
me
to
turn
my
back
on
per
cent
when
all
the
rest
are
pocketing
what
they
can
like
sensible
men
no
such
fool
if
going
to
pick
and
choose
your
acquaintances
on
moral
principles
you
better
clear
out
of
this
country
unless
you
want
to
cut
yourself
out
of
all
decent
society
the
world
is
such
a
bad
place
as
the
croakers
make
out
so
long
as
you
do
fly
openly
in
the
face
of
society
society
does
ask
any
inconvenient
questions
and
it
makes
precious
short
work
of
the
cads
who
do
there
are
no
secrets
better
kept
than
the
secrets
that
everybody
guesses
in
the
society
i
can
introduce
you
to
no
lady
or
gentleman
would
so
far
forget
themselves
as
to
discuss
my
business
affairs
or
your
mother
indeed
no
lady
or
gentleman
would
discuss
the
profession
of
and
her
confrÃ¨res
but
they
partake
of
the
dividends
when
the
evil
becomes
too
crying
they
engage
in
vice
crusades
and
call
down
the
wrath
of
the
lord
and
the
brutality
of
the
police
upon
the
warrens
and
her
victims
while
the

the
other
patrons

parade
as
the
protectors
of

the
home
and
the
family
no
one
of
the
least
intelligence
denies
the
cruelty
the
injustice
the
outrage
of
such
a
state
of
affairs
any
more
than
it
is
being
denied
that
the
training
of
woman
as
a
sex
commodity
has
left
her
any
other
source
of
income
except
to
sell
herself
to
one
man
within
marriage
or
to
many
men
outside
of
marriage
only
bigots
and
inexperienced
girls
like
can
say
that
everybody
has
some
choice
the
poorest
girl
alive
may
not
be
able
to
choose
between
being
queen
of
england
or
principal
of
newnham
but
she
can
choose
between
and
according
to
her
taste
it
is
astonishing
how
little
education
and
college
degrees
teach
people
had
been
compelled
to
shift
for
herself
she
would
have
discovered
that
neither
nor
brings
enough
to
satisfy
one
taste
it
is
not
a
question
of
choice
but
of
necessity
which
is
the
determining
factor
in
most
people
lives
when
shaw
flung
into
the
smug
midst
of
society
even
the
educated
vivians
knew
little
of
the
compelling
force
which
whips
thousands
of
women
into
prostitution
as
to
the
ignorant
their
minds
are
a
mental
and
spiritual
desert
naturally
the
play
caused
consternation
it
still
continues
to
serve
as
the
red
rag
to
the
social
bull
warren
profession
infuriates
because
it
goes
to
the
bottom
of
our
evils
because
it
places
the
accusing
finger
upon
the
sorest
and
most
damnable
spot
in
our
social
fabric
sex
as
woman
only
commodity
in
the
competitive
market
of

an
immoral
and
heretical
play
indeed
of
very
deep
social
significance
major
barbara
major
barbara
is
of
still
greater
social
importance
inasmuch
as
it
points
to
the
fact
that
while
charity
and
religion
are
supposed
to
minister
to
the
poor
both
institutions
derive
their
main
revenue
from
the
poor
by
the
perpetuation
of
the
evils
both
pretend

the
daughter
of
the
world
renowned
cannon
manufacturer
has
joined
the
salvation
army
the
latter
lays
claim
to
being
the
most
humane
religious
institution
because
unlike
other
soul
savers
it
does
not
entirely
forget
the
needs
of
the
body
it
also
teaches
that
the
greater
the
sinner
the
more
glorious
the

but
as
no
one
is
quite
as
black
as
he
is
painted
it
becomes
necessary
for
those
who
want
to
be
saved
and
incidentally
to
profit
by
the
salvation
army
to
invent
sins
the

the

you

listen

you

she
was

where
will
you
spend

i
a

of

i
tell
you
it
is
inevitable
that
the
salvation
army
like
all
other
religious

charitable
institutions
should
by
its
very
character
foster
cowardice
and
hypocrisy
as
a
premium
securing
entry
into

being
a
novice
is
as
ignorant
of
this
as
she
is
unaware
of
the
source
of
the
money
which
sustains
her
and
the
work
of
the

she
consistently
refuses
to
accept
the
conscience
sovereign
of
for
beating
up
a
salvation
lassie
not
so
the
army
commissioner
she
is
dyed
in
the
wool
in
the
profession
of
begging
and
will
take
money
from
the
devil
himself
for
the
glory
of
god
the
glory
of
god
which
consists
in
taking
out
the
anger
and
bitterness
against
the
rich
from
the
hearts
of
the
poor
a
service
gratifying
and
convenient
for
all
large
employers
no
wonder
the
whisky
distiller
makes
the
generous
contribution
of
pounds
and
adds
his
own
little
mite
of
another

indeed
ignorant
or
she
would
not
protest
against
a
fact
so
notorious
do
you
know
what
my
father
is
have
you
forgotten
that
lord
saxmundham
is
bodger
the
whisky
man
do
you
remember
how
we
implored
the
county
council
to
stop
him
from
writing
bodger
whisky
in
letters
of
fire
against
the
sky
so
that
the
poor
creatures
on
the
embankment
could
not
wake
up
from
their
snatches
of
sleep
without
being
reminded
of
their
deadly
thirst
by
that
wicked
sky
sign
do
you
know
that
the
worst
thing
that
i
have
had
to
fight
here
is
not
the
devil
but
bodger
bodger
bodger
with
his
whisky
his
distilleries
and
his
tied
houses
are
you
going
to
make
our
shelter
another
tied
house
for
him
and
ask
me
to
keep
it
my
dear
barbara
alcohol
is
a
very
necessary
article
it
heals
the
sick
it
assists
the
doctor
that
is
perhaps
a
less
questionable
way
of
putting
it
it
makes
life
bearable
to
millions
of
people
who
could
not
endure
their
existence
if
they
were
quite
sober
it
enables
parliament
to
do
things
at
eleven
at
night
that
no
sane
person
would
do
at
eleven
in
the
morning
barbara
lord
saxmundham
gives
us
the
money
to
stop
drinking
to
take
his
own
business
from
him
i
also
baines
may
claim
a
little
disinterestedness
think
of
my
business
think
of
the
widows
and
orphans
the
men
and
lads
torn
to
pieces
with
shrapnel
and
poisoned
with
lyddite
the
oceans
of
blood
not
one
drop
of
which
is
shed
in
a
really
just
cause
the
ravaged
crops
the
peaceful
peasants
forced
women
and
men
to
till
their
fields
under
the
fire
of
opposing
armies
on
pain
of
starvation
the
bad
blood
of
the
fierce
cowards
at
home
who
egg
on
others
to
fight
for
the
gratification
of
national
vanity
all
this
makes
money
for
me
i
am
never
richer
never
busier
than
when
the
papers
are
full
of
it
well
it
is
your
work
to
preach
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
to
men
every
convert
you
make
is
a
vote
against

yet
i
give
you
this
money
to
hasten
my
own
commercial
ruin
drunkenness
and
murder
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaked
me
however
indignation
does
not
last
very
long
any
more
than
that
of
her
aristocratic
mother
who
has
no
use
for
her
plebeian
husband
except
when
she
needs
his
money
similarly
her
son
has
become
converted
like
not
to
the
glory
hallelujah
of
the
salvation
army
but
to
the
power
of
money
and
cannon
likewise
the
rest
of
the
family
including
the
greek
scholar
suitor
during
the
visit
to
their
father
factory
the
undershaft
family
makes
several
discoveries
they
learn
that
the
best
modern
method
of
accumulating
a
large
fortune
consists
in
organizing
industries
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
the
workers
content
with
their
slavery
it
a
model
factory
it
is
a
spotlessly
clean
and
beautiful
hillside
town
there
are
two
chapels
a
primitive
one
and
a
sophisticated
one
there
even
an
ethical
society
but
it
is
not
much
patronized
as
my
men
are
all
strongly
religious
in
the
high
explosives
sheds
they
object
to
the
presence
of
agnostics
as
unsafe
the
family
further
learns
that
it
is
not
high
moral
precepts
patriotic
love
of
country
or
similar
sentiments
that
are
the
backbone
of
the
life
of
the
nation
it
is
again
who
enlightens
them
of
the
power
of
money
and
its
rÃ´le
in
dictating
governmental
policies
making
war
or
peace
and
shaping
the
destinies
of
man
the
government
of
your
country
i
am
the

you
suppose

you

a
half
a

amateurs
like
you
sitting
in
a

in
that
foolish
gabble
shop
can
govern
undershaft
and
lazarus
no
my
friend
you
will
do
what
pays
us
you
will
make
war
when
it
suits
us
and
keep
peace
when
it
does
you
will
find
out
that
trade
requires
certain
measures
when
we
have
decided
on
those
measures
when
i
want
anything
to
keep
my
dividends
up
you
will
discover
that
my
want
is
a
national
need
when
either
people
want
something
to
keep
my
dividends
down
you
will
call
out
the
police
and
military
and
in
return
you
shall
have
the
support
and
applause
of
my
newspapers
and
the
delight
of
imagining
that
you
are
a
great
statesman
government
of
your
country
be
off
with
you
my
boy
and
play
with
your
caucuses
and
leading
articles
and
historic
parties
and
great
leaders
and
burning
questions
and
the
rest
of
your
toys
i
am
going
back
to
my
counting
house
to
pay
the
piper
and
call
the
tune
to
give
arms
to
all
men
who
offer
an
honest
price
for
them
without
respect
of
persons
or
principles
to
aristocrat
and
republican
to
nihilist
and
tsar
to
capitalist
and
socialist
to
protestant
and
catholic
to
burglar
and
policeman
to
black
man
white
man
and
yellow
man
to
all
sorts
and
conditions
all
nationalities
all
faiths
all
follies
all
causes
and
all
crimes
i
will
take
an
order
from
a
good
man
as
cheerfully
as
from
a
bad
one
if
you
good
people
prefer
preaching
and
shirking
to
buying
my
weapons
and
fighting
the
rascals
do
blame
me
i
can
make
cannons
i
can
not
make
courage
and
conviction
that
is
just
it
the
undershafts
can
not
make
conviction
and
courage
yet
both
are
indispensable
if
one
is
to
see
that
in
the
words
of
cleanliness
and
respectability
do
not
need
justification
they
justify
themselves
there
are
millions
of
poor
people
abject
people
dirty
people
ill
fed
ill
clothed
people
they
poison
us
morally
and
physically
they
kill
the
happiness
of
society
they
force
us
to
do
away
with
our
own
liberties
and
to
organize
unnatural
cruelties
for
fear
they
should
rise
against
us
and
drag
us
down
into
their
abyss
only
fools
fear
crime
we
all
fear
poverty
i
had
rather
be
a
thief
than
a
pauper
i
had
rather
be
a
murderer
than
a
slave
i
do
want
to
be
either
but
if
you
force
the
alternative
on
me
then
by
heaven
i
choose
the
braver
and
more
moral
one
i
hate
poverty
and
slavery
worse
than
any
other
crimes
whatsoever
the
scientist
realizes
the
force
of
argument
long
enough
have
the
people
been
preached
at
and
intellectual
power
used
to
enslave
them
as
a
teacher
of
greek
i
gave
the
intellectual
man
weapons
against
the
common
man
i
now
want
to
give
the
common
man
weapons
against
the
intellectual
man
i
love
the
common
people
i
want
to
arm
them
against
the
lawyer
the
doctor
the
priest
the
literary
man
the
professor
the
artist
and
the
politician
who
once
in
authority
are
the
most
dangerous
disastrous
and
tyrannical
of
all
the
fools
rascals
and
impostors
this
thought
is
perhaps
the
most
revolutionary
sentiment
in
the
whole
play
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
people
everywhere
are
enslaved
by
the
awe
of
the
lawyer
the
professor
and
the
politician
even
more
than
by
the
club
and
gun
it
is
the
lawyer
and
the
politician
who
poison
the
people
with
the
germ
of
briefs
and
politics
thereby
unfitting
them
for
the
only
effective
course
in
the
great
social
struggle
action
resultant
from
the
realization
that
poverty
and
inequality
never
have
been
never
can
be
preached
or
voted
out
of
existence
poverty
and
slavery
have
stood
up
for
centuries
to
your
sermons
and
leading
articles
they
will
not
stand
up
to
my
machine
guns
do
preach
at
them
do
reason
with
them
kill
them
killing
is
that
your
remedy
for
everything
it
is
the
final
test
of
conviction
the
only
lever
strong
enough
to
overturn
a
social
system
the
only
way
of
saying
must
let
six
hundred
and
seventy
fools
loose
in
the
street
and
three
policemen
can
scatter
them
but
huddle
them
together
in
a
certain
house
in
westminster
and
let
them
go
through
certain
ceremonies
and
call
themselves
certain
names
until
at
last
they
get
the
courage
to
kill
and
your
six
hundred
and
seventy
fools
become
a
government
your
pious
mob
fills
up
ballot
papers
and
imagines
it
is
governing
its
masters
but
the
ballot
paper
that
really
governs
is
the
paper
that
has
a
bullet
wrapped
up
in
it
vote
bah
when
you
vote
you
only
change
the
names
of
the
cabinet
when
you
shoot
you
pull
down
governments
inaugurate
new
epochs
abolish
old
orders
and
set
up
new
is
that
historically
true
mr
learned
man
or
is
it
not
it
is
historically
true
i
loathe
having
to
admit
it
i
repudiate
your
sentiments
i
abhor
your
nature
i
defy
you
in
every
possible
way
still
it
is
true
but
it
ought
not
to
be
true
ought
ought
ought
ought
ought
are
you
going
to
spend
your
life
saying
ought
like
the
rest
of
our
moralists
turn
your
oughts
into
shells
man
come
and
make
explosives
with
me
the
history
of
the
world
is
the
history
of
those
who
had
the
courage
to
embrace
this
truth
major
barbara
is
one
of
the
most
revolutionary
plays
in
any
other
but
dramatic
form
the
sentiments
uttered
therein
would
have
condemned
the
author
to
long
imprisonment
for
inciting
to
sedition
and
violence
shaw
the
fabian
would
be
the
first
to
repudiate
such
utterances
as
rank
anarchy
impractical
brain
cracked
and
criminal
but
shaw
the
dramatist
is
closer
to
life
closer
to
reality
closer
to
the
historic
truth
that
the
people
wrest
only
as
much
liberty
as
they
have
the
intelligence
to
want
and
the
courage
to
take
john
galsworthy
the
power
of
the
modern
drama
as
an
interpreter
of
the
pressing
questions
of
our
time
is
perhaps
nowhere
evident
as
clearly
as
it
is
in
england
indeed
while
other
countries
have
come
almost
to
a
standstill
in
dramatic
art
england
is
the
most
productive
at
the
present
time
nor
can
it
be
said
that
quantity
has
been
achieved
at
the
expense
of
quality
which
is
only
too
often
the
case
the
most
prolific
english
dramatist
john
galsworthy
is
at
the
same
time
a
great
artist
whose
dramatic
quality
can
be
compared
with
that
of
only
one
other
living
writer
namely
gerhart
hauptmann
galsworthy
even
as
hauptmann
is
neither
a
propagandist
nor
a
moralist
his
background
is
life
that
palpitating
life
which
is
the
root
of
all
sorrow
and
joy
his
attitude
toward
dramatic
art
is
given
in
the
following
words
i
look
upon
the
stage
as
the
great
beacon
light
of
civilization
but
the
drama
should
lead
the
social
thought
of
the
time
and
not
direct
or
dictate
it
the
great
duty
of
the
dramatist
is
to
present
life
as
it
really
is
a
true
story
if
told
sincerely
is
the
strongest
moral
argument
that
can
be
put
on
the
stage
it
is
the
business
of
the
dramatist
so
to
present
the
characters
in
his
picture
of
life
that
the
inherent
moral
is
brought
to
light
without
any
lecturing
on
his
part
moral
codes
in
themselves
are
after
all
not
lasting
but
a
true
picture
of
life
is
a
man
may
preach
a
strong
lesson
in
a
play
which
may
exist
for
a
day
but
if
he
succeeds
in
presenting
real
life
itself
in
such
a
manner
as
to
carry
with
it
a
certain
moral
inspiration
the
force
of
the
message
need
never
be
lost
for
a
new
interpretation
to
fit
the
spirit
of
the
time
can
renew
its
vigor
and
power
john
galsworthy
has
undoubtedly
succeeded
in
presenting
real
life
it
is
this
that
makes
him
so
thoroughly
human
and
universal
strife
not
since
hauptmann
weavers
was
placed
before
the
thoughtful
public
has
there
appeared
anything
more
stirring
than
strife
its
theme
is
a
strike
in
the
trenartha
tin
plate
works
on
the
borders
of
england
and
wales
the
play
largely
centers
about
the
two
dominant
figures
the
president
of
the
company
rigid
autocratic
and
uncompromising
he
is
unwilling
to
make
the
slightest
concession
although
the
men
have
been
out
for
six
months
and
are
in
a
condition
of
on
the
other
hand
there
is
an
uncompromising
revolutionist
whose
devotion
to
the
workers
and
the
cause
of
freedom
is
at
heat
between
them
are
the
strikers
worn
and
weary
with
the
terrible
struggle
driven
and
tortured
by
the
awful
sight
of
poverty
at
home
at
a
directors
meeting
attended
by
the
company
representatives
from
london
the
president
son
and
a
man
of
kindly
feeling
pleads
in
behalf
of
the
strikers
i
do
see
how
we
can
get
over
it
that
to
go
on
like
this
means
starvation
to
the
men
wives
and
families
it
wo
kill
the
shareholders
to
miss
a
dividend
or
two
i
do
see
that
reason
enough
for
knuckling
under
h
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
that
brute
roberts
had
got
us
down
here
with
the
very
same
idea
i
hate
a
man
with
a
grievance
we
did
pay
him
enough
for
his
discovery
i
always
said
that
at
the
time
we
paid
him
five
hundred
and
a
bonus
of
two
hundred
three
years
later
if
that
not
enough
what
does
he
want
for
sake
company
made
a
hundred
thousand
out
of
his
brains
and
paid
him
seven
hundred
that
the
way
he
goes
on
sir
the
man
a
rank
agitator
look
here
i
hate
the
unions
but
now
we
got
harness
here
let
get
him
to
settle
the
whole
thing
the
trade
union
official
speaks
in
favor
of
compromise
in
the
beginning
of
the
strike
the
union
had
withdrawn
its
support
because
the
workers
had
used
their
own
judgment
in
deciding
to
strike
i
quite
frank
with
you
we
were
forced
to
withhold
our
support
from
your
men
because
some
of
their
demands
are
in
excess
of
current
rates
i
expect
to
make
them
withdraw
those
demands
now
i
want
to
see
something
fixed
upon
before
i
go
back
tonight
ca
we
have
done
with
this
business
what
good
it
doing
you
why
do
you
recognize
once
for
all
that
these
people
are
men
like
yourselves
and
want
what
good
for
them
just
as
you
want
what
good
for
you
there
just
one
very
simple
question
i
like
to
put
to
you
will
you
pay
your
men
one
penny
more
than
they
force
you
to
pay
them
of
course
not
with
trade
unionism
lacking
in
true
solidarity
and
the
workers
not
conscious
of
their
power
why
should
the
company
pay
one
penny
more
is
the
only
one
who
fully
understands
the
situation
justice
from
london
what
are
you
talking
about
henry
thomas
have
you
gone
silly
we
know
very
well
what
we
are
discontented
dogs
never
satisfied
what
did
the
chairman
tell
me
up
in
london
that
i
did
know
what
i
was
talking
about
i
was
a
foolish
uneducated
man
that
knew
nothing
of
the
wants
of
the
men
i
spoke
for
i
have
this
to
say
and
first
as
to
their
condition
ye
ca
squeeze
them
any
more
every
man
of
us
is
well
nigh
starving
ye
wonder
why
i
tell
ye
that
every
man
of
us
is
going
short
we
ca
be
no
worse
off
than
we
been
these
weeks
past
ye
need
think
that
by
waiting
ye
drive
us
to
come
in
we
die
first
the
whole
lot
of
us
the
men
have
sent
for
ye
to
know
once
and
for
all
whether
ye
are
going
to
grant
them
their
demands
ye
know
best
whether
ye
can
afford
your
tyranny
but
this
i
tell
ye
if
ye
think
the
men
will
give
way
the
least
part
of
an
inch
ye
making
the
worst
mistake
ye
ever
made
ye
think
because
the
union
is
not
supporting
us
more
shame
to
it
that
we
be
coming
on
our
knees
to
you
one
fine
morning
ye
think
because
the
men
have
got
their
wives
an
families
to
think
of
that
it
just
a
question
of
a
week
or
two
the
appalling
state
of
the
strikers
is
demonstrated
by
the
women
sick
with
heart
trouble
and
slowly
dying
for
want
of
warmth
and
nourishment
so
accustomed
to
privation
that
her
present
poverty
seems
easy
compared
with
the
misery
of
her
whole
life
into
this
dismal
environment
comes
the
president
daughter
with
delicacies
and
jams
for
like
many
women
of
her
station
she
imagines
that
a
little
sympathy
will
bridge
the
chasm
between
the
classes
or
as
her
father
says
you
think
with
your
gloved
hands
you
can
cure
the
troubles
of
the
century
does
not
know
the
life
of
class
that
it
is
all
a
gamble
from
the
time
born
to
the
time
dies
roberts
says
workin
folk
have
always
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
sixpence
is
worth
more
than
a
that
what
they
say
he
says
that
when
a
working
man
baby
is
born
it
a
from
breath
to
breath
whether
it
ever
draws
another
and
so
on
all
life
an
when
he
comes
to
be
old
it
the
workhouse
or
the
grave
he
says
that
without
a
man
is
very
near
and
pinches
and
stints
and
children
to
save
there
can
be
neither
surplus
nor
security
that
why
he
have
no
children
not
though
i
wanted
them
the
strikers
meeting
is
a
masterly
study
of
mass
psychology
the
men
swayed
hither
and
thither
by
the
different
speakers
and
not
knowing
whither
to
go
it
is
the
who
first
weakens
their
determination
to
hold
out
cut
your
demands
to
the
right
pattern
and
we
see
you
through
refuse
and
do
expect
me
to
waste
my
time
coming
down
here
again
i
not
the
sort
that
speaks
at
random
as
you
ought
to
know
by
this
time
if
you
the
sound
men
i
take
you
for
no
matter
who
advises
you
against
it
you
make
up
your
minds
to
come
in
and
trust
to
us
to
get
your
terms
which
is
it
to
be
hands
together
and
victory
or
the
starvation
you
got
now
then
appeals
to
their
religious
sentiments
it
iss
not
london
it
iss
not
the
union
it
iss
nature
it
iss
no
disgrace
whateffer
to
a
potty
to
give
in
to
nature
for
this
nature
iss
a
fery
pig
thing
it
is
pigger
than
what
a
man
is
there
is
more
years
to
my
hett
than
to
the
hett
of
anyone
here
it
is
a
man
pisness
to
pe
pure
honest
just
and
merciful
that
what
chapel
tells
you
we
going
the
roat
to
tamnation
an
so
i
say
to
all
of
you
if
ye
co
against
chapel
i
will
not
pe
with
you
nor
will
any
other
man
at
last
makes
his
plea
who
has
given
his
all
brain
heart
and
blood
aye
sacrificed
even
his
wife
to
the
cause
by
sheer
force
of
eloquence
and
sincerity
he
stays
his
fickle
comrades
long
enough
at
least
to
listen
to
him
though
they
are
too
broken
to
rise
to
his
great
dignity
and
courage
you
do
want
to
hear
me
then
you
listen
to
rous
and
to
that
old
man
but
not
to
me
you
listen
to
sim
harness
of
the
union
that
treated
you
so
maybe
you
listen
to
those
men
from
london
you
love
their
feet
on
your
necks
do
you
am
i
a
liar
a
coward
a
traitor
if
only
i
were
ye
listen
to
me
i
sure
is
there
a
man
of
you
here
who
has
less
to
gain
by
striking
is
there
a
man
of
you
that
had
more
to
lose
is
there
a
man
among
you
who
has
given
up
eight
hundred
pounds
since
this
trouble
began
come
now
is
there
how
much
has
thomas
given
up
ten
pounds
or
five
or
what
you
listened
to
him
and
what
had
he
to
say
none
can
pretend
he
said
that
i
not
a
believer
in
principle
but
when
nature
says
further
going
against
nature
i
tell
you
if
a
man
can
not
say
to
nature
budge
me
from
this
if
ye
can
his
principles
are
but
his
belly
oh
but
thomas
says
a
man
can
be
pure
and
honest
just
and
merciful
and
take
off
his
hat
to
nature
i
tell
you
nature
neither
pure
nor
honest
just
nor
merciful
you
chaps
that
live
over
the
hill
an
go
home
dead
beat
in
the
dark
on
a
snowy
night
do
ye
fight
your
way
every
inch
of
it
do
ye
go
lyin
down
an
trustin
to
the
tender
mercies
of
this
merciful
nature
try
it
and
you
soon
know
with
what
ye
got
to
deal
only
by
that
strikes
a
blow
with
his
clenched
in
nature
face
that
a
man
can
be
a
man
give
in
says
thomas
go
down
on
your
knees
throw
up
your
foolish
fight
an
perhaps
he
said
perhaps
your
enemy
will
chuck
you
down
a
crust
and
what
did
he
say
about
chapel
against
it
he
said
she
against
it
well
if
chapel
and
nature
go
hand
in
hand
it
the
first
i
ever
heard
of
it
surrendering
the
work
of
cowards
and
traitors
you
felt
the
pinch
in
your
bellies
you
forgotten
what
that
fight
been
many
times
i
have
told
you
i
will
tell
you
now
this
once
again
the
fight
o
the
country
body
and
blood
against
a
the
fight
of
those
that
spend
themselves
with
every
blow
they
strike
and
every
breath
they
draw
against
a
thing
that
fattens
on
them
and
grows
and
grows
by
the
law
of
nature
that
thing
is
capital
a
thing
that
buys
the
sweat
o
brows
and
the
tortures
o
their
brains
at
its
own
price
do
i
know
that
was
the
work
o
my
brains
bought
for
seven
hundred
pounds
and
has
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
been
gained
them
by
that
seven
hundred
without
the
stirring
of
a
finger
it
is
a
thing
that
will
take
as
much
and
give
you
as
little
as
it
can
capital
a
thing
that
will
say
i
very
sorry
for
you
poor
fellows
you
have
a
cruel
time
of
it
i
know
but
will
not
give
one
sixpence
of
its
dividends
to
help
you
have
a
better
time
capital
tell
me
for
all
their
talk
is
there
one
of
them
that
will
consent
to
another
penny
on
the
income
tax
to
help
the
poor
capital
a
monster
ye
have
got
it
on
its
knees
are
ye
to
give
up
at
the
last
minute
to
save
your
miserable
bodies
pain
when
i
went
this
morning
to
those
old
men
from
london
i
looked
into
their
very
one
of
them
was
sitting
there
scantlebury
a
mass
of
flesh
nourished
on
us
sittin
there
for
all
the
world
like
the
shareholders
in
this
company
that
sit
not
moving
tongue
nor
finger
takin
dividends
a
great
dumb
ox
that
can
only
be
roused
when
its
food
is
threatened
i
looked
into
his
eyes
and
i
saw
was
afraid
for
himself
and
his
dividends
afraid
for
his
fees
afraid
of
the
very
shareholders
he
stands
for
and
all
but
one
of
them
afraid
like
children
that
get
into
a
wood
at
night
and
start
at
every
rustle
of
the
leaves
i
ask
you
men
give
me
a
free
hand
to
tell
them
go
you
back
to
london
the
men
have
nothing
for
you
give
me
that
and
i
swear
to
you
within
a
week
you
shall
have
from
london
all
you
want
is
not
for
this
little
moment
of
time
we
fighting
not
for
our
own
little
bodies
and
their
wants
is
for
all
those
that
come
after
throughout
all
time
oh
men
for
the
love
o
them
do
roll
up
another
stone
upon
their
heads
do
help
to
blacken
the
sky
let
the
bitter
sea
in
over
them
they
welcome
to
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
me
to
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
us
all
they
are
they
if
we
can
shake
the
monster
with
the
bloody
lips
that
has
sucked
the
life
out
of
ourselves
our
wives
and
children
since
the
world
began
if
we
have
not
the
hearts
of
men
to
stand
against
it
breast
to
breast
and
eye
to
eye
and
force
it
backward
till
it
cry
for
mercy
it
will
go
on
sucking
life
and
we
shall
stay
forever
what
we
are
less
than
the
very
dogs
consistency
is
the
greatest
crime
of
our
commercial
age
no
matter
how
intense
the
spirit
or
how
important
the
man
the
moment
he
will
not
allow
himself
to
be
used
or
sell
his
principles
he
is
thrown
on
the
dust
heap
such
is
the
fate
of
the
president
of
the
company
and
of
to
be
sure
they
represent
opposite
poles
poles
antagonistic
to
each
other
poles
divided
by
a
terrible
gap
that
can
never
be
bridged
over
yet
they
share
a
common
fate
is
the
embodiment
of
conservatism
of
old
ideas
of
iron
methods
i
have
been
chairman
of
this
company
since
its
inception
two
and
thirty
years
ago
i
have
had
to
do
with
men
for
fifty
years
i
always
stood
up
to
them
i
have
never
been
beaten
yet
i
have
fought
the
men
of
this
company
four
times
and
four
times
i
have
beaten
them
the
men
have
been
treated
justly
they
have
had
fair
wages
we
have
always
been
ready
to
listen
to
complaints
it
has
been
said
that
times
have
changed
if
they
have
i
have
not
changed
with
them
neither
will
i
it
has
been
said
that
masters
and
men
are
equal
cant
there
can
only
be
one
master
in
a
house
where
two
men
meet
the
better
man
will
rule
it
has
been
said
that
capital
and
labor
have
the
same
interests
cant
their
interests
are
as
wide
asunder
as
the
poles
it
has
been
said
that
the
board
is
only
part
of
a
machine
cant
we
the
machine
its
brains
and
sinews
it
is
for
us
to
lead
and
to
determine
what
is
to
be
done
and
to
do
it
without
fear
or
favor
fear
of
the
men
fear
of
the
shareholders
fear
of
our
own
shadows
before
i
am
like
that
i
hope
to
die
there
is
only
one
way
of
treating
men
with
the
iron
hand
this
business
the
manners
of
this
generation
has
brought
all
this
upon
us
sentiments
and
softness
and
what
this
young
man
no
doubt
would
call
his
social
policy
you
ca
eat
cake
and
have
it
this
sentiment
or
socialism
or
whatever
it
may
be
is
rotten
masters
are
masters
men
are
men
yield
one
demand
and
they
will
make
it
six
they
are
like
oliver
twist
asking
for
more
if
i
were
in
place
i
should
be
the
same
but
i
am
not
in
their
place
i
have
been
accused
of
being
a
domineering
tyrant
thinking
only
of
my
pride
i
am
thinking
of
the
future
of
this
country
threatened
with
the
black
waters
of
confusion
threatened
with
mob
government
threatened
with
what
i
can
not
say
if
by
any
conduct
of
mine
i
help
to
bring
this
on
us
i
shall
be
ashamed
to
look
my
fellows
in
the
face
before
i
put
this
amendment
to
the
board
i
have
one
more
word
to
say
if
it
is
carried
it
means
that
we
shall
fail
in
what
we
set
ourselves
to
do
it
means
that
we
shall
fail
in
the
duty
that
we
owe
to
all
capital
it
means
that
we
shall
fail
in
the
duty
that
we
owe
ourselves
we
may
not
like
this
adherence
to
old
reactionary
notions
and
yet
there
is
something
admirable
in
the
courage
and
consistency
of
this
man
nor
is
he
half
as
dangerous
to
the
interests
of
the
oppressed
as
our
sentimental
and
soft
reformers
who
rob
with
nine
fingers
and
give
libraries
with
the
tenth
who
grind
human
beings
and
spend
millions
of
dollars
in
social
research
work
is
a
worthy
foe
to
fight
such
a
foe
one
must
learn
to
meet
him
in
open
battle
has
all
the
mental
and
moral
attributes
of
his
adversary
coupled
with
the
spirit
of
revolt
and
the
inspiration
of
modern
ideas
he
too
is
consistent
he
wants
nothing
for
his
class
short
of
complete
victory
it
is
inevitable
that
compromise
and
petty
interest
should
triumph
until
the
masses
become
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
a
will
they
ever
prophecy
is
not
the
vocation
of
the
dramatist
yet
the
moral
lesson
is
evident
one
can
not
help
realizing
that
the
workingmen
will
have
to
use
methods
hitherto
unfamiliar
to
them
that
they
will
have
to
discard
the
elements
in
their
midst
that
are
forever
seeking
to
reconcile
the
irreconcilable
capital
and
labor
they
will
have
to
learn
that
men
like
are
the
very
forces
that
have
revolutionized
the
world
and
thus
paved
the
way
for
emancipation
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
monster
with
bloody
lips
toward
a
brighter
horizon
a
freer
life
and
a
truer
recognition
of
human
values
justice
no
subject
of
equal
social
import
has
received
such
thoughtful
consideration
in
recent
years
as
the
question
of
crime
and
punishment
a
number
of
books
by
able
writers
both
in
europe
and
this
country
preÃ«minently
among
them
prison
memoirs
of
an
anarchist
by
alexander
berkman
discuss
this
topic
from
the
historic
psychologic
and
social
standpoint
the
consensus
of
opinion
being
that
present
penal
institutions
and
our
methods
of
coping
with
crime
have
in
every
respect
proved
inadequate
as
well
as
wasteful
this
new
attitude
toward
one
of
the
gravest
social
wrongs
has
now
also
found
dramatic
interpretation
in
galsworthy
justice
the
play
opens
in
the
office
of
how
solicitors
the
senior
clerk
discovers
that
a
check
he
had
issued
for
nine
pounds
has
been
forged
to
ninety
by
elimination
suspicion
falls
upon
the
junior
office
clerk
the
latter
is
in
love
with
a
married
woman
the
abused
and
wife
of
a
brutal
drunkard
pressed
by
his
employer
a
severe
yet
not
unkindly
man
confesses
the
forgery
pleading
the
dire
necessity
of
his
sweetheart
with
whom
he
had
planned
to
escape
to
save
her
from
the
unbearable
brutality
of
her
husband
oh
sir
look
over
it
i
pay
the
money
back
i
will
i
promise
notwithstanding
the
entreaties
of
young
who
holds
modern
ideas
his
father
a
moral
and
citizen
turns
over
to
the
police
the
second
act
in
the
court
room
shows
justice
in
the
very
process
of
manufacture
the
scene
equals
in
dramatic
power
and
psychologic
verity
the
great
court
scene
in
resurrection
young
a
nervous
and
rather
weakly
youth
of
stands
before
the
bar
his
faithful
sweetheart
full
of
love
and
devotion
burns
with
anxiety
to
save
the
young
man
whose
affection
for
her
has
brought
about
his
present
predicament
is
defended
by
whose
speech
to
the
jury
is
a
masterpiece
of
social
philosophy
he
does
not
attempt
to
dispute
the
mere
fact
that
his
client
had
altered
the
check
and
though
he
pleads
temporary
aberration
in
his
defense
the
argument
is
based
on
a
social
consciousness
as
fundamental
and
as
the
roots
of
our
social
ills
the
background
of
life
that
palpitating
life
which
always
lies
behind
the
commission
of
a
crime
he
shows
to
have
faced
the
alternative
of
seeing
the
beloved
woman
murdered
by
her
brutal
husband
whom
she
can
not
divorce
or
of
taking
the
law
into
his
own
hands
he
pleads
with
the
jury
not
to
turn
the
weak
young
man
into
a
criminal
by
condemning
him
to
prison
men
like
the
prisoner
are
destroyed
daily
under
our
law
for
want
of
that
human
insight
which
sees
them
as
they
are
patients
and
not
criminals
justice
is
a
machine
that
when
someone
has
given
it
a
starting
push
rolls
on
of
itself
is
this
young
man
to
be
ground
to
pieces
under
this
machine
for
an
act
which
at
the
worst
was
one
of
weakness
is
he
to
become
a
member
of
the
luckless
crews
that
man
those
dark
ships
called
prisons
i
urge
you
gentlemen
do
not
ruin
this
young
man
for
as
a
result
of
those
four
minutes
ruin
utter
and
irretrievable
stares
him
in
the
face
the
rolling
of
the
chariot
wheels
of
justice
over
this
boy
began
when
it
was
decided
to
prosecute
him
but
the
chariot
of
justice
rolls
mercilessly
on
for
as
the
learned
judge
says
your
counsel
has
made
an
attempt
to
trace
your
offense
back
to
what
he
seems
to
suggest
is
a
defect
in
the
marriage
law
he
has
made
an
attempt
also
to
show
that
to
punish
you
with
further
imprisonment
would
be
unjust
i
do
not
follow
him
in
these
flights
law
is
what
it
a
majestic
edifice
sheltering
all
of
us
each
stone
of
which
rests
on
another
i
am
concerned
only
with
its
administration
the
crime
you
have
committed
is
a
very
serious
one
i
can
not
feel
it
in
accordance
with
my
duty
to
society
to
exercise
the
powers
i
have
in
your
favor
you
will
go
to
penal
servitude
for
three
years
in
prison
the
young
inexperienced
convict
soon
finds
himself
the
victim
of
the
terrible
system
the
authorities
admit
that
young
is
mentally
and
physically
in
bad
shape
but
nothing
can
be
done
in
the
matter
many
others
are
in
a
similar
position
and
the
quarters
are
inadequate
the
third
scene
of
the
third
act
is
in
its
silent
force
the
whole
scene
is
a
pantomime
taking
place
in
prison
cell
in
daylight
in
his
stockings
is
seen
standing
motionless
with
his
head
inclined
towards
the
door
listening
he
moves
a
little
closer
to
the
door
his
stockinged
feet
making
no
noise
he
stops
at
the
door
he
is
trying
harder
and
harder
to
hear
something
any
little
thing
that
is
going
on
outside
he
springs
suddenly
upright
as
if
at
a
sound
and
remains
perfectly
motionless
then
with
a
heavy
sigh
he
moves
to
his
work
and
stands
looking
at
it
with
his
head
down
he
does
a
stitch
or
two
having
the
air
of
a
man
so
lost
in
sadness
that
each
stitch
is
as
it
were
a
coming
to
life
then
turning
abruptly
he
begins
pacing
his
cell
moving
his
head
like
an
animal
pacing
its
cage
he
stops
again
at
the
door
listens
and
placing
the
palms
of
his
hands
against
it
with
his
fingers
spread
out
leans
his
forehead
against
the
iron
turning
from
it
presently
he
moves
slowly
back
towards
the
window
tracing
his
way
with
his
finger
along
the
top
line
of
the
distemper
that
runs
round
the
wall
he
stops
under
the
window
and
picking
up
the
lid
of
one
of
the
tins
peers
into
it
it
has
grown
very
nearly
dark
suddenly
the
lid
falls
out
of
his
hand
with
a
clatter
the
only
sound
that
has
broken
the
silence
and
he
stands
staring
intently
at
the
wall
where
the
stuff
of
the
shirt
is
hanging
rather
white
in
the
darkness
he
seems
to
be
seeing
somebody
or
something
there
there
is
a
sharp
tap
and
click
the
cell
light
behind
the
glass
screen
has
been
turned
up
the
cell
is
brightly
lighted
is
seen
gasping
for
breath
a
sound
from
far
away
as
of
distant
dull
beating
on
thick
metal
is
suddenly
audible
shrinks
back
not
able
to
bear
this
sudden
clamor
but
the
sound
grows
as
though
some
great
tumbril
were
rolling
towards
the
cell
and
gradually
it
seems
to
hypnotize
him
he
begins
creeping
inch
by
inch
nearer
to
the
door
the
banging
sound
travelling
from
cell
to
cell
draws
closer
and
closer
hands
are
seen
moving
as
if
his
spirit
had
already
joined
in
this
beating
and
the
sound
swells
until
it
seems
to
have
entered
the
very
cell
he
suddenly
raises
his
clenched
fists
panting
violently
he
flings
himself
at
his
door
and
beats
on
it
leaves
the
prison
a
broken
man
the
stamp
of
the
convict
upon
his
brow
the
iron
of
misery
in
his
soul
i
seem
to
be
struggling
against
a
thing
that
all
round
me
i
ca
explain
it
it
as
if
i
was
in
a
net
as
fast
as
i
cut
it
here
it
grows
up
there
i
did
act
as
i
ought
to
have
about
references
but
what
are
you
to
do
you
must
have
them
and
that
made
me
afraid
and
i
left
in
fact
i
i
afraid
all
the
time
now
thanks
to
pleading
the
firm
of
how
is
willing
to
take
back
in
their
employ
on
condition
that
he
give
up
resents
this
i
could
give
her
up
i
could
oh
sir
i
all
got
to
look
to
and
i
sure
she
all
i
got
it
is
then
that
learns
the
awful
news
that
the
woman
he
loves
had
been
driven
by
the
chariot
wheel
of
justice
to
sell
herself
i
tried
making
skirts
cheap
things
it
was
the
best
i
could
get
but
i
never
made
more
than
ten
shillings
a
week
buying
my
own
cotton
and
working
all
day
i
hardly
ever
got
to
bed
till
past
twelve
i
kept
at
it
for
nine
months
it
was
starvation
for
the
children
and
then
my
employer
happened
he
happened
ever
since
at
this
terrible
psychologic
moment
the
police
appear
to
drag
back
to
prison
for
failing
to
report
to
the
authorities
as
man
completely
overcome
by
the
inexorability
of
his
fate
throws
himself
down
the
stairs
breaking
his
neck
the
significance
of
justice
consists
not
only
in
the
portrayal
of
the
inhuman
system
which
grinds
the
falders
and
honeywills
but
even
more
so
in
the
utter
helplessness
of
society
as
expressed
in
the
words
of
the
senior
clerk
no
one
touch
him
now
never
again
he
safe
with
gentle
jesus
the
pigeon
john
galsworthy
calls
this
play
a
fantasy
to
me
it
seems
cruelly
real
it
demonstrates
that
the
best
human
material
is
crushed
in
the
fatal
mechanism
of
our
life
the
pigeon
also
discloses
to
us
the
inadequacy
of
charity
individual
and
organized
to
cope
with
poverty
as
well
as
the
absurdity
of
reformers
and
experimenters
who
attempt
to
patch
up
effects
while
they
ignore
the
causes
an
artist
a
man
deeply
in
sympathy
with
all
human
sorrow
and
failings
generously
shares
his
meager
means
with
everyone
who
applies
to
him
for
help
his
daughter
is
of
a
more
practical
turn
of
mind
she
can
not
understand
that
giving
is
as
natural
and
necessary
to
her
father
as
light
and
air
indeed
the
greatest
joy
in
life
perhaps
is
actuated
by
anxiety
for
her
father
who
is
so
utterly
hopeless
that
he
would
give
away
his
last
pair
of
trousers
from
her
point
of
view
people
who
beg
are
rotters
decent
folk
would
not
stoop
to
begging
but
heart
is
too
full
of
humanity
to
admit
of
such
a
attitude
we
not
all
the
same
one
likes
to
be
friendly
what
the
use
of
being
alive
if
one
is
unfortunately
most
people
are
not
alive
to
the
tragedies
around
them
they
are
often
unthinking
mechanisms
mere
tabulating
machines
like
the
professor
who
believes
that
we
to
give
the
state
all
we
can
spare
to
make
the
undeserving
deserving
or
as
the
justice
of
the
peace
who
insists
that
we
ought
to
support
private
organizations
for
helping
the
deserving
and
damn
the
undeserving
finally
there
is
the
who
religiously
seeks
the
middle
road
and
wants
a
little
of
both
when
concludes
that
her
father
is
the
despair
of
all
social
reformers
she
is
but
expressing
a
great
truism
namely
that
social
reform
is
a
cold
and
bloodless
thing
that
can
find
no
place
in
the
glowing
humanity
of
it
is
christmas
eve
the
birth
of
him
who
came
to
proclaim
peace
on
earth
good
will
to
all
is
about
to
retire
when
he
is
disturbed
by
a
knock
on
the
door
the
figure
of
appears
she
is
a
to
whom
had
once
given
his
card
that
she
might
find
him
in
case
of
need
she
comes
to
him
when
the
rest
of
the
world
has
passed
her
by
forlorn
and
almost
as
dead
as
her
violets
which
no
one
cares
to
buy
at
sight
of
her
misery
forgets
his
daughter
practical
admonition
and
his
promise
to
her
not
to
be
a
fool
he
treats
the
tenderly
makes
her
warm
and
comfortable
he
has
barely
time
to
show
into
his
model
room
when
another
knock
is
heard
this
time
it
is
an
alien
a
globe
trotter
without
means
a
tramp
whom
had
once
met
in
the
without
food
for
days
and
unable
to
endure
the
cold
too
comes
to
the
artist
if
i
had
not
found
you
monsieur
i
would
have
been
a
little
hole
in
the
river
i
was
so
discouraged
and
to
think
that
in
a
few
minutes
he
will
be
born
the
world
would
reproach
you
for
your
goodness
to
me
monsieur
if
he
himself
were
on
earth
now
there
would
be
a
little
heap
of
gentlemen
writing
to
the
journals
every
day
to
call
him
sloppee
sentimentalist
and
what
is
veree
funny
these
gentlemen
they
would
all
be
most
strong
christians
but
that
will
not
trouble
you
monsieur
i
saw
well
from
the
first
that
you
are
no
christian
you
have
so
kind
a
face
has
deeper
insight
into
the
character
of
than
his
daughter
he
knows
that
the
artist
would
not
judge
nor
could
he
refuse
one
whom
misery
stares
in
the
face
even
the
third
visitor
of
the
old
cabman
with
more
whisky
than
bread
in
his
stomach
receives
the
same
generous
reception
as
the
other
two
the
next
day
calls
a
council
of
war
the
learned
professor
the
wise
judge
thomas
and
the
professional
christian
the
canon
are
summoned
to
decide
the
fate
of
the
three
outcasts
there
are
few
scenes
in
dramatic
literature
so
rich
in
satire
so
deep
in
the
power
of
analysis
as
the
one
in
which
these
eminent
gentlemen
discuss
human
destiny
is
emphatic
that
it
is
necessary
to
remove
the
temptation
and
reform
the
husband
of
the
now
what
is
to
be
done
i
could
get
an
unfurnished
room
if
i
the
money
to
furnish
it
never
mind
the
money
what
i
want
to
find
in
you
is
repentance
those
who
are
engaged
in
saving
souls
can
not
be
interested
in
such
trifles
as
money
matters
nor
to
understand
the
simple
truth
that
if
the
megans
did
not
have
to
bother
with
making
a
livin
repentance
would
take
care
of
itself
the
other
two
gentlemen
are
more
worldly
since
law
and
science
can
not
experiment
with
such
elusive
things
as
the
soul
opines
that
is
a
congenital
case
to
be
put
under
observation
while
decides
that
he
must
be
sent
to
prison
is
it
do
you
think
chronic
unemployment
with
a
vagrant
tendency
or
would
it
be
nearer
the
mark
to
say
vagrancy
dipsomaniac
by
the
look
of
his
face
as
far
as
one
can
see
it
i
should
say
there
was
a
leaning
towards
mania
i
know
the
treatment
hundreds
of
these
fellows
before
me
in
my
time
the
only
thing
is
a
sharp
lesson
i
disagree
i
seen
the
man
what
he
requires
is
steady
control
and
the
dobbins
treatment
not
a
bit
of
it
he
wants
one
for
his
knob
bracing
him
up
it
the
only
thing
you
moving
backwards
sir
thomas
i
told
you
before
convinced
reactionaryism
in
these
days
the
merest
sense
of
continuity
a
simple
instinct
for
order
the
only
way
to
get
order
sir
is
to
bring
the
disorderly
up
with
a
round
turn
you
people
without
practical
experience
the
question
is
a
much
wider
one
sir
thomas
no
sir
i
repeat
if
the
country
once
commits
itself
to
your
views
of
reform
it
as
good
as
doomed
i
seem
to
have
heard
that
before
sir
thomas
and
let
me
say
at
once
that
your
of
bricks
rÃ©gime
is
a
deuced
sight
better
sir
than
your
grandmotherly
methods
what
the
old
fellow
wants
is
a
shock
with
all
this
socialistic
you
losing
sight
of
the
individual
you
sir
with
your
devil
take
the
hindmost
have
never
seen
him
the
farce
ends
by
each
one
insisting
on
the
superiority
of
his
own
pet
theory
while
misery
continues
to
stalk
through
the
streets
three
months
later
determines
to
rescue
her
father
from
his
disreputable
proclivities
by
removing
with
him
to
a
part
of
the
city
where
their
address
will
remain
unknown
to
his
beggar
friends
and
acquaintances
while
their
belongings
are
being
removed
relates
the
trouble
he
had
with
i
consulted
with
calway
and
he
advised
me
to
try
a
certain
institution
we
got
her
safely
in
excellent
place
but
know
she
broke
out
three
weeks
ago
and
since
heard
hopeless
i
afraid
quite
i
sometimes
tempted
to
believe
there
nothing
for
some
of
these
poor
folk
but
to
pray
for
death
the
professor
said
he
felt
there
was
nothing
for
some
of
these
poor
devils
but
a
lethal
chamber
what
is
science
for
if
not
to
advise
a
lethal
chamber
it
the
easiest
way
to
dispose
of
the
unfit
and
to
supply
learned
professors
with
the
means
of
comfortable
livelihood
yet
there
is
the
vagabond
the
social
outcast
who
has
never
seen
the
inside
of
a
university
propounding
a
philosophy
which
very
few
professors
even
dream
of
while
i
was
on
the
road
this
time
i
fell
ill
of
a
fever
it
seemed
to
me
in
my
illness
that
i
saw
the
truth
how
i
was
wasting
in
this
world
i
would
never
be
good
for
anyone
nor
anyone
for
me
all
would
go
by
and
i
never
of
it
fame
and
fortune
and
peace
even
the
necessities
of
life
ever
mocking
me
and
i
saw
so
plain
that
i
should
be
vagabond
all
my
days
and
my
days
short
i
dying
in
the
end
the
death
of
a
dog
i
saw
it
all
in
my
fever
clear
as
that
flame
there
was
nothing
for
us
others
but
the
herb
of
death
and
so
i
wished
to
die
i
told
no
one
of
my
fever
i
lay
out
on
the
ground
it
was
verree
cold
but
they
would
not
let
me
die
on
the
roads
of
their
parishes
they
took
me
to
an
institution
i
looked
in
their
eyes
while
i
lay
there
and
i
saw
more
clear
than
the
blue
heaven
that
they
thought
it
best
that
i
should
die
although
they
would
not
let
me
then
naturally
my
spirit
rose
and
i
said
so
much
the
worse
for
you
i
will
live
a
little
more
one
is
made
like
that
life
is
sweet
that
little
girl
you
had
here
monsieur
in
her
too
there
is
something
of
wild
savage
she
must
have
joy
of
life
i
have
seen
her
since
i
came
back
she
has
embraced
the
life
of
joy
it
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
she
is
lost
monsieur
as
a
stone
that
sinks
in
water
i
can
see
if
she
can
not
for
the
great
part
of
mankind
to
see
anything
is
fatal
no
monsieur
to
be
so
near
to
death
has
done
me
good
i
shall
not
lack
courage
any
more
till
the
wind
blows
on
my
grave
since
i
saw
you
monsieur
i
have
been
in
three
institutions
they
are
palaces
one
little
thing
they
lack
those
palaces
it
is
understanding
of
the
heart
in
them
tame
birds
pluck
wild
birds
naked
ah
monsieur
i
am
loafer
waster
what
you
like
for
all
that
poverty
is
my
only
crime
if
i
were
rich
should
i
not
be
simply
verree
original
respected
with
soul
above
commerce
traveling
to
see
the
world
and
that
young
girl
would
she
not
be
that
charming
ladee
veree
chic
you
know
and
the
old
tims
good
gentleman
drinking
his
liquor
well
eh
bien
what
are
we
now
dark
beasts
despised
by
all
that
is
life
monsieur
monsieur
it
is
just
that
you
understand
when
we
are
with
you
we
feel
something
here
he
touches
his
heart
if
i
had
one
prayer
to
make
it
would
be
good
god
give
me
to
understand
those
sirs
with
their
theories
they
can
clean
our
skins
and
chain
our
that
soothes
for
them
the
Ã¦sthetic
sense
it
gives
them
too
their
good
little
importance
but
our
spirits
they
can
not
touch
for
they
nevare
understand
without
that
monsieur
all
is
dry
as
a
parched
skin
of
orange
monsieur
of
their
industry
i
say
nothing
they
do
a
good
work
while
they
attend
with
their
theories
to
the
sick
and
the
tame
old
and
the
good
unfortunate
deserving
above
all
to
the
little
children
but
monsieur
when
all
is
done
there
are
always
us
hopeless
ones
what
can
they
do
with
me
monsieur
with
that
girl
or
with
that
old
man
ah
monsieur
we
too
our
qualities
we
others
it
wants
you
courage
to
undertake
a
career
like
mine
or
like
that
young
girl
we
wild
ones
we
know
a
thousand
times
more
of
life
than
ever
will
those
sirs
they
waste
their
time
trying
to
make
rooks
white
be
kind
to
us
if
you
will
or
let
us
alone
like
mees
ann
but
do
not
try
to
change
our
skins
leave
us
to
live
or
leave
us
to
die
when
we
like
in
the
free
air
if
you
do
not
wish
of
us
you
have
but
to
shut
your
pockets
and
your
doors
we
shall
die
the
faster
if
you
can
not
how
is
it
our
fault
the
harm
we
do
to
others
is
it
so
much
if
i
am
criminal
dangerous
shut
me
up
i
would
not
pity
myself
nevare
but
we
in
whom
something
moves
like
that
flame
monsieur
that
can
not
keep
still
we
others
we
are
not
many
that
must
have
motion
in
our
lives
do
not
let
them
make
us
prisoners
with
their
theories
because
we
are
not
like
them
it
is
life
itself
they
would
enclose
the
good
god
made
me
so
that
i
would
rather
walk
a
whole
month
of
nights
hungry
with
the
stars
than
sit
one
single
day
making
round
business
on
an
office
stool
it
is
not
to
my
advantage
i
can
not
help
it
that
i
am
a
vagabond
what
would
you
have
it
is
stronger
than
me
monsieur
i
say
to
you
things
i
have
never
said
monsieur
are
you
really
english
the
english
are
so
civilized
truly
the
english
are
highly
civilized
else
it
would
be
impossible
to
explain
why
of
all
the
nations
on
earth
the
should
be
the
only
ones
to
punish
attempts
at
suicide
society
makes
no
provision
whatever
for
the
timsons
the
ferrands
and
megans
it
has
closed
the
door
in
their
face
denying
them
a
seat
at
the
table
of
life
yet
when
attempts
to
drown
herself
a
benevolent
constable
drags
her
out
and
a
christian
judge
sends
her
to
the
workhouse
well
sir
we
ca
get
over
the
facts
can
we
you
know
what
soocide
amounts
to
it
an
awkward
job
but
look
here
constable
as
a
reasonable
man
this
poor
wretched
little
girl
know
what
that
life
means
better
than
anyone
why
it
to
her
credit
to
try
and
jump
out
of
it
ca
neglect
me
duty
sir
that
impossible
of
all
the
d
d
not
a
soul
in
the
world
wants
her
alive
and
now
she
is
to
be
prosecuted
for
trying
to
go
where
everyone
wishes
her
is
it
necessary
to
dwell
on
the
revolutionary
significance
of
this
cruel
reality
it
is
so
in
its
sweep
so
penetrating
of
the
of
our
civilization
with
all
its
cant
and
artifice
so
powerful
in
its
condemnation
of
our
cheap
theories
and
cold
institutionalism
which
freezes
the
soul
and
destroys
the
best
and
finest
in
our
being
the
wellwyns
ferrands
and
megans
are
the
stuff
out
of
which
a
real
humanity
might
be
fashioned
they
feel
the
needs
of
their
fellows
and
whatever
is
in
their
power
to
give
they
give
as
nature
does
unreservedly
but
the
hoxtons
calways
and
bertleys
have
turned
the
world
into
a
dismal
prison
and
mankind
into
monotonous
gray
dull
shadows
the
professors
judges
and
preachers
can
not
meet
the
situation
neither
can
to
be
sure
and
yet
his
very
understanding
of
the
differentiation
of
human
nature
and
his
sympathy
with
the
inevitable
reaction
of
conditions
upon
it
bring
the
wellwyns
much
closer
to
the
solution
of
our
evils
than
all
the
hoxtons
calways
and
bertleys
put
together
this
deep
conception
of
social
factors
is
in
itself
perhaps
the
most
significant
lesson
taught
in
the
pigeon
stanley
houghton
hindle
wakes
in
stanley
houghton
who
died
last
year
the
drama
lost
a
talented
and
brave
artist
brave
because
he
had
the
courage
to
touch
one
of
the
most
sensitive
spots
of
puritanism
woman
virtue
whatever
else
one
may
criticise
or
attack
the
sacredness
of
virtue
must
remain
untouched
it
is
the
last
fetich
which
even
people
refuse
to
destroy
to
be
sure
the
attitude
towards
this
holy
of
holies
has
of
late
years
undergone
a
considerable
change
it
is
beginning
to
be
felt
in
circles
that
love
is
its
own
justification
requiring
no
sanction
of
either
religion
or
law
the
revolutionary
idea
however
that
woman
may
even
as
man
follow
the
urge
of
her
nature
has
never
before
been
so
sincerely
and
radically
expressed
the
message
of
hindle
wakes
is
therefore
of
inestimable
value
inasmuch
as
it
dispels
the
fog
of
the
silly
sentimentalism
and
disgusting
bombast
that
declares
woman
a
thing
apart
from
nature
one
who
neither
does
nor
must
crave
the
joys
of
life
permissible
to
man
hindle

small

wakefulness
of

shortcomings
of

together
as
lads
in
the
cotton
mill
but
while

always
a
timid

shrinking

aggressive
and
ambitious
when
the
play
opens
though
an
old

a
poor

on
the
contrary
has
reached
the
top
of
financial

social

though
she
at

they
soon
discover
that
the

passed
the
time
with
a
man

naturally
horrified
and
decide
to
force
the

in
the
old
mother
of
the
author
has
succeeded
in
giving
a
most
splendid
characterization
of
the
born
drudge
hardened
by
her
long
struggle
with
poverty
and
grown
shrewd
in
the
ways
of
the
world
she
knows
her
daughter
so
little
however
that
she
believes
had
schemed
the
affair
with
in
the
hope
that
she
might
force
him
to
marry
her
in
her
imagination
the
old
woman
already
sees
as
the
mistress
of
the
jeffcote
estate
she
persuades
her
husband
to
go
immediately
to
the

though
it
is
very
late
at
night
the
old
man
is
forced
to
start
out
on
his
disagreeable
errand
a
man
of
integrity

much
shocked
at
the
news

to
him
by
old
nevertheless
he
will
not
countenance
the
wrong
i
see
you
treated
right
do
you
hear
i
ca
ask
for
more
than
that
i
see
you
treated
right
young
had
never
known
responsibility
why
should
he
with
so
much
wealth
awaiting
him
when
confronted
by
his
father
and
told
that
he
must
marry
he
fights
hard
against
it
it
may
be
said
in
justice
to
that
he
really
loves
his
betrothed
though
such
a
circumstance
has
never
deterred
the
alans
from
having
a
lark
with
another
girl
the
young
man
resents
his
father
command
to
marry
the
mill
girl
but
when
even
insists
that
he
belongs
to
unwillingly
consents
a
devout
christian
believes
in
renunciation
i
do
need
you
alan
so
much
that
nothing
on
earth
could
make
me
break
off
our
engagement
if
i
felt
that
it
was
at
all
possible
to
let
it
go
on
but
it
is
it
impossible
and
you
want
me
to
marry
fanny
yes
oh
alan
ca
you
see
what
a
splendid
sacrifice
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
make
not
only
to
do
the
right
thing
but
to
give
up
so
much
in
order
to
do
it
the
and
the
gather
to
arrange
the
marriage
of
their
children
it
does
not
occur
to
them
to
consult
in
the
matter
much
to
their
consternation
refuses
to
abide
by
the
decision
of
the
family
council
it
very
good
of
you
you
hire
the
parson
and
get
the
license
and
make
all
the
arrangements
on
your
own
without
consulting
me
and
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
save
turn
up
meek
as
a
lamb
at
the
church
or
registry
office
or
whatever
it
is
that
just
where
you
make
the
mistake
i
do
want
to
marry
alan
i
mean
what
i
say
and
i
trouble
you
to
talk
to
me
without
swearing
at
me
i
not
one
of
the
family
yet
the
dismayed
parents
and
even
plead
with
her
and
threaten
but
is
obdurate
at
last
asks
to
be
left
alone
with
her
confident
that
he
can
persuade
the
girl
look
here
fanny
what
all
this
nonsense
about
why
wo
you
marry

you
ca
understand
a
girl
not
jumping
at
you
when
she
gets
the
chance
can
you
how
is
it
that
you
are
going
to
marry
beatrice
farrar
were
you
fond
of
her
very
i
gave

up
because
my
father
made
me
made
you
good
lord
a
chap
of
your
age
my
father
a
man
who
will
have
his
own
way
he
can
keep
me
short
of
brass
earn
some
brass
i
can
earn
some
brass
but
it
will
mean
hard
work
and
take
time
and
after
all
i
sha
earn
anything
like
what
i
get
now
then
all
you
want
to
wed
me
for
is
what
you
get
with
me
i
to
be
given
away
with
a
pound
of
tea
as
it
were
i
know
why
you
wo
marry
me
you
doing
it
for
my
sake
do
you
kid
yourself
my
lad
it
is
because
i
afraid
of
spoiling
your
life
that
i
refusing

but
because
i
afraid
of
spoiling
mine
that
did
occur
to
you
look
here
fanny
i
promise

the
time

fear
that

have
too
much
money
for
that
i
can
manage
all
right
on
bob
a
week
i
going
to
fall
between
two
stools
it
all
up
with
beatrice
of
course
and
if
you
wo
have
me
i
shall
have
parted
from
her
to
no
purpose
besides
getting
kicked
out
of
the
house
by
my
father
more
than
likely
you
said
you
were
fond
of
me
once
but
it
has
taken
you
long
to
alter
all
women
are
built
alike
beatrice
is
religious
she
be
sorry
for
you
i
was
fond
of
you
in
a
way
but
you
did
ever
really
love
me
love
you
good
heavens
of
course
not
why
on
earth
should
i
love
you
you
were
just
someone
to
have
a
bit
of
fun
with
you
were
an
amusement
a
lark
how
much
more
did
you
care
for
me
but
it
not
the
same
i
a
man
you
a
man
and
i
was
your
little
fancy
well
i
a
woman
and
you
were
my
little
fancy
you
would
prevent
a
woman
enjoying
herself
as
well
as
a
man
if
she
takes
it
into
her
head
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
did
care
any
more
for
me
than
a
fellow
cares
for
any
girl
he
happens
to
pick
up
yes
are
you
shocked
it
a
bit
thick
it
is
really
you
a
beauty
to
talk
it
sounds
so
jolly
immoral
i
never
thought
of
a
girl
looking
on
a
chap
just
like
that
i
made
sure
you
wanted
to
marry
me
if
you
got
the
chance
no
fear
you
not
good
enough
for
me
the
chap
fanny
hawthorn
weds
has
got
to
be
made
of
different
stuff
from
you
my
lad
husband
if
ever
i
have
one
will
be
a
man
not
a
fellow
who
throw
over
his
girl
at
his
father
bidding
strikes
me
the
sons
of
these
rich
manufacturers
are
all
much
alike
they
seem
a
bit
weak
in
the
upper
story
it
their
father
brass
that
too
much
for
them
happen
you
no
call
to
be
afraid
i
not
going
to
disgrace
you
but
so
long
as
i
to
live
my
own
life
i
do
see
why
i
should
choose
what
it
to
be
unheard
of
is
it
not
that
a
fanny
should
refuse
to
be
made
a
good
woman
and
that
she
should
dare
demand
the
right
to
live
in
her
own
way
it
has
always
been
considered
the
most
wonderful
event
in
the
life
of
a
girl
if
a
young
man
of
wealth
of
position
of
station
came
into
her
life
and
said
i
will
take
you
as
my
wife
until
death
do
us
part
but
a
new
type
of
girlhood
is
in
the
making
we
are
developing
the
fannies
who
learn
in
the
school
of
life
the
hardest
the
crudest
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
vital
and
instructive
school
why
should
marry
a
young
man
in
order
to
become
good
any
more
than
that
he
should
marry
her
in
order
to
become
good
is
it
not
because
we
have
gone
on
for
centuries
believing
that
woman
value
her
integrity
and
position
in
society
center
about
her
sex
and
consist
only
in
her
virtue
and
that
all
other
usefulness
weighs
naught
in
the
balance
against
her
purity
if
she
dare
express
her
sex
as
the
fannies
do
we
deny
her
individual
and
social
worth
and
stamp
her
fallen
the
past
of
a
man
is
never
questioned
no
one
inquires
how
many
fannies
have
been
in
his
life
yet
man
has
the
impudence
to
expect
the
fannies
to
abstain
till
he
is
ready
to
bestow
on
them
his
name
hindle
wakes
is
a
much
needed
and
important
social
lesson
not
because
it
necessarily
involves
the
idea
that
every
girl
must
have
sex
experience
before
she
meets
the
man
she
loves
but
rather
that
she
has
the
right
to
satisfy
if
she
so
chooses
her
emotional
and
sex
demands
like
any
other
need
of
her
mind
and
body
when
the
fannies
become
conscious
of
that
right
the
relation
of
the
sexes
will
lose
the
shallow
romanticism
and
artificial
exaggeration
that
mystery
has
surrounded
it
with
and
assume
a
wholesome
natural
and
therefore
healthy
and
normal
expression
githa
sowerby
rutherford
and
son
the
women
rights
women
who
claim
for
their
sex
the
most
wonderful
things
in
the
way
of
creative
achievement
will
find
it
difficult
to
explain
the
fact
that
until
the
author
of
rutherford
and
son
made
her
appearance
no
country
had
produced
a
single
woman
dramatist
of
note
that
is
the
more
remarkable
because
woman
has
since
time
immemorial
been
a
leading
figure
in
histrionic
art
rachel
sarah
bernhardt
eleanore
duse
and
scores
of
others
have
had
few
male
peers
it
can
hardly
be
that
woman
is
merely
a
reproducer
and
not
a
creator
we
have
but
to
recall
such
creative
artists
as
charlotte
and
emily
brontÃ©
george
sand
george
eliot
mary
wollstonecraft
marie
bashkirtshev
rosa
bonheur
sophia
kovalevskaya
and
a
host
of
others
to
appreciate
that
woman
has
been
a
creative
factor
in
literature
art
and
science
not
so
in
the
drama
so
far
the
stronghold
exclusively
of
men
it
is
therefore
an
event
for
a
woman
to
come
to
the
fore
who
possesses
such
dramatic
power
realistic
grasp
and
artistic
penetration
as
evidenced
by
githa
sowerby
the
circumstance
is
the
more
remarkable
because
githa
sowerby
is
according
to
her
publishers
barely
out
of
her
teens
and
though
she
be
a
genius
her
exceptional
maturity
is
a
phenomenon
rarely
observed
generally
maturity
comes
only
with
experience
and
suffering
no
one
who
has
not
felt
the
crushing
weight
of
the
rutherford
atmosphere
could
have
painted
such
a
vivid
and
picture
the
basic
theme
in
rutherford
and
son
is
not
novel
turgenev
ibsen
and
such
lesser
artists
as
sudermann
and
stanley
houghton
have
dealt
with
it
the
chasm
between
the
old
and
the
young
the
tragic
struggle
of
parents
against
their
children
the
one
frantically
holding
on
the
other
recklessly
letting
go
but
rutherford
and
son
is
more
than
that
it
is
a
picture
of
the
paralyzing
effect
of
tradition
and
institutionalism
on
all
human
life
growth
and
change
the
owner
of
the
firm
rutherford
and
son
is
possessed
by
the
phantom
of
the
past
the
thing
handed
down
to
him
by
his
father
and
which
he
must
pass
on
to
his
son
with
undiminished
luster
the
thing
that
has
turned
his
soul
to
iron
and
his
heart
to
stone
the
thing
for
the
sake
of
which
he
has
never
known
joy
and
because
of
which
no
one
else
must
know
joy
rutherford
and
son
the
crushing
weight
of
this
inexorable
monster
on
rutherford
and
his
children
is
significantly
summed
up
by
young
john
have
you
ever
heard
of
moloch
no
well
moloch
was
a
sort
of
a
god
some
time
ago
you
know
before
dick
and
his
kind
came
along
they
built
his
image
with
an
ugly
head
ten
times
the
size
of
a
real
head
with
great
wheels
instead
of
legs
and
set
him
up
in
the
middle
of
a
great
dirty
town
and
they
thought
him
a
very
important
person
indeed
and
made
sacrifices
to
him
human
sacrifices
to
keep
him
going
you
know
out
of
every
family
they
set
aside
one
child
to
be
an
offering
to
him
when
it
was
big
enough
and
at
last
it
became
a
sort
of
honor
to
be
dedicated
in
this
way
so
much
so
that
the
victims
came
themselves
gladly
to
be
crushed
out
of
life
under
the
great
wheels
that
was
moloch
dedicated
we
are
dedicated
all
of
us
to
rutherfords
not
only
the
rutherford
children
their
withered
and
old
himself
but
even
the
faithful
servant
in
the
employ
of
the
rutherfords
for
years
is
dedicated
and
when
he
ceases
to
be
of
use
to
their
moloch
he
is
turned
into
a
thief
and
then
cast
off
even
as
and
not
love
for
his
oldest
son
or
sympathy
with
the
latter
wife
and
child
induces
old
to
forgive
his
son
marriage
with
a
mere
but
because
he
needs
to
serve
the
house
of
rutherford
the
one
inexorable
purpose
always
and
ever
his
second
son
who
is
in
the
ministry
and
of
no
use
to
old
god
of
stone
receives
the
loving
assurance
you
were
no
good
for
my
purpose
and
there
the
end
for
the
matter
o
that
you
might
just
as
well
never
ha
been
born
for
that
matter
his
daughter
might
also
never
have
been
born
except
that
she
was
good
enough
to
look
after
her
father
house
serve
him
even
helping
take
off
his
boots
and
submitting
without
a
murmur
to
the
loveless
dismal
life
in
the
rutherford
home
her
father
has
sternly
kept
every
suitor
away
because
no
one
in
grantley
good
enough
for
us
has
become
faded
sour
and
miserable
with
yearning
for
love
for
sunshine
and
warmth
and
when
she
at
last
dares
to
partake
of
it
secretly
with
her
father
trusted
man
old
sets
his
iron
heel
upon
her
love
and
drags
it
through
the
mud
till
it
lies
dead
again
when
he
faces
the
spirit
of
rebellion
in
his
son
crushes
it
without
the
slightest
hesitation
in
behalf
of
his
one
obsession
his
one
god
the
house
of
rutherford
has
made
an
invention
which
holds
great
possibilities
by
means
of
it
he
hopes
to
shake
of
the
deadly
grip
of
the
rutherfords
he
wants
to
become
a
free
man
and
mold
a
new
life
for
himself
for
his
wife
and
child
he
knows
his
father
will
not
credit
the
value
of
his
invention
he
dare
not
approach
him
the
rutherford
children
have
been
held
in
dread
of
their
parent
too
long
turns
to
the
faithful
servant
the
only
one
in
the
confidence
of
feels
himself
safe
with
but
he
does
not
know
that
too
is
dedicated
to
moloch
broken
by
his
years
of
service
left
without
will
without
purpose
outside
of
the
rutherfords
tries
to
enlist
interest
in
behalf
of
but
the
old
man
decides
that
must
turn
over
his
invention
to
the
house
of
rutherford

blow
upon
her
head
it
does
not
come
as
a
surprise
to
her
when
old
discovers
her
relation
with
his
indignation
is
as
characteristic
of
the
man
as
everything
else
in
his
life
it
is
not
outraged
morality
or
a

love
it
is
always
and
forever
the
house
of
rutherford
moreover
the
discovery
of
the
affair
between
his
daughter
and
his
workman
comes
at
a
psychologic
moment
is
determined
to
get
hold
of
invention
for
the
rutherfords
of
course
and
now
that
has
broken
faith
with
his
master
his
offense
serves
an
easy
pretext
for
to
break
faith
with
he
calls
the
old
servant
to
his
office
and
demands
the
receipt
of
invention
entrusted
to
on
the
latter
refusal
to
betray
the
master
plays
on
the
man
loyalty
to
the
rutherfords
rutherfords
is
going
down
down
i
got
to
pull
her
up
somehow
there
one
way
out
john
made
this
metal
a
thing
i
take
your
word
for
it
that
worth
a
fortune
and
going
to
sit
by
and
watch
him
fooling
it
away
selling
it
for
a
song
to
miles
or
jarvis
that
we
could
break
if
we
had
half
a
chance
you
got
but
to
put
your
hand
in
your
pocket
to
save
the
place
and
you
do
do
it
you
with
them
you
with
the
little
souls
that
ca
see
beyond
the
next
shilling
they
put
in
their
pockets
when
men
steal
martin
they
do
it
to
gain
something
if
i
steal
this
what
i
gain
by
it
if
i
make
money
what
i
buy
with
it
pleasure
maybe
children
to
come
after
me
glad
o
what
i
done
tell
me
anything
in
the
wide
world
that
bring
me
joy
and
i
swear
to
you
never
to
touch
it
if
you
give
it
to
me
what
you
gain
by
it
not
a
farthing
shall
you
ever
have
from
me
no
more
than
i
get
myself
and
what
will
john
get
for
it
rutherfords
when
i
gone
he
thank
you
in
ten
years
he
come
to
laugh
at
himself
him
and
his
price
he
see
the
big
thing
one
day
mebbe
like
what
i
done
he
see
that
it
was
no
more
his
than
was
yours
to
give
nor
mine
to
take
rutherfords
will
you
give
it
to
me
i
take
shame
to
be
doing
it
now
he
worked
it
out
along
o
me
every
time
it
changed
he
come
running
to
show
me
like
a
bairn
wi
a
new
toy
it
for
rutherfords
rutherfords
ruthlessly
marches
on
if
the
rutherford
purpose
does
not
shrink
from
corrupting
its
most
trusted
servant
it
surely
will
not
bend
before
a
daughter
who
has
dared
even
once
in
her
life
to
assert
herself
how
far
it
gone
right
at
first
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
you
ever
found
out
i
go
right
away
to
put
things
straight
he
wanted
to
tell
you
at
the
first
but
i
knew
that
it
would
be
no
use
it
was
said
not
to
tell
you
martin
that
i
trusted
as
i
trust
myself
you
have
turned
him
away
you
could
do
that
that
my
business
you
could
do
that
not
martin
leave
it
leave
it
martin
my
servant
that
i
pay
wages
to
i
made
a
name
for
my
children
a
name
respected
in
all
the
countryside
and
you
go
with
a
workingman
you
leave
my
house
d
understand
i
have
no
light
ways
under
my
roof
no
one
shall
say
i
winked
at
it
you
can
bide
the
night
when
i
come
in
i
to
find
ye
gone
your
name
sha
be
spoken
in
my
house
never
again
oh
you
no
pity
i
was
gone
sour
nobody
ever
come
after
me
not
even
when
i
was
young
you
took
care
o
that
half
of
my
life
was
gone
all
of
it
that
mattered
martin
loves
me
honest
do
you
come
near
do
you
touch
that
you
think
that
i
sorry
you
found
out
you
think
you
done
for
me
when
you
use
shameful
words
on
me
and
turn
me
out
o
your
house
you
let
me
out
o
jail
whatever
happens
to
me
now
i
sha
go
on
living
as
i
lived
here
whatever
martin
done
he
taken
me
from
you
you
ruined
my
life
you
with
your
getting
on
i
loved
in
wretchedness
all
the
joy
i
ever
had
made
wicked
by
the
fear
o
you
who
are
you
who
are
you
a
man
a
man
that
takes
power
to
himself
power
to
gather
people
to
him
and
use
them
as
he
wills
a
man
that
take
the
blood
of
life
itself
and
put
it
into
the
works
into
rutherfords
and
what
ha
you
got
by
it
what
you
got
dick
that
you
bullied
till
he
a
fool
john
waiting
for
the
time
when
he
can
sell
what
you
done
and
you
got
me
me
to
take
your
boots
off
at
night
to
wish
you
dead
when
i
had
to
touch
you
now
now
you
know
it
but
for
the
great
love
in
her
heart
could
not
have
found
courage
to
face
her
father
as
she
did
but
love
gives
strength
it
instills
hope
and
faith
and
kindles
anew
the
fires
of
life
why
then
should
it
not
be
strong
enough
to
break
the
fetters
of
even
rutherfords
such
a
love
only
those
famished
for
affection
and
warmth
can
feel
and
was
famished
for
life
i
had
a
dream
a
dream
that
i
was
in
a
place
wi
flowers
in
the
white
and
thick
like
they
never
grow
on
the
moor
but
it
was
the
moor
a
place
near
martin
cottage
and
i
dreamt
that
he
came
to
me
with
the
look
he
had
when
i
was
a
little
lass
with
his
head
up
and
the
lie
gone
out
of
his
eyes
all
the
time
i
knew
i
was
on
my
bed
in
my
room
here
but
it
was
as
if
sweetness
poured
into
me
spreading
and
covering
me
like
the
water
in
the
tarn
when
the
rains
are
heavy
in
the
fells
that
why
i
dreamt
of
him
so
last
night
it
was
as
if
all
that
was
best
in
me
was
in
that
dream
what
i
was
as
a
bairn
and
what
i
going
to
be
he
could
help
but
love
me
it
was
a
message
i
could
have
thought
of
it
by
myself
it
something
that
come
to
me
here
her
hands
on
her
part
of
me
all
that
lay
dormant
in
now
turns
into
glowing
fire
at
the
touch
of
spring
but
in
life
has
been
marred
strangled
by
the
iron
hand
of
rutherfords
turned
away
i
am
sure
enough
years
and
in
a
minute
it
broke
wi
two
words
you
say
that
now
because
your
heart
cold
with
the
trouble
but
it
warm
again
it
warm
again
i
warm
it
out
of
my
own
heart
martin
my
heart
that
ca
be
made
cold
i
rather
ha
died
than
he
turn
me
away
i
ha
lost
everything
in
the
world
to
know
that
i
was
true
to
like
i
was
till
you
looked
at
me
wi
the
love
in
your
face
it
was
a
great
love
ye
gave
me
you
in
your
grand
hoose
wi
your
delicate
ways
but
broke
me
but
it
just
the
same
with
us
just
the
same
as
ever
it
was
aye
but
there
no
mending
wi
the
likes
o
him
what
there
to
mend
what
there
to
mend
except
bound
you
like
a
slave
all
the
years
you
free
free
for
the
first
time
since
you
were
a
lad
mebbe
we
begin
again
we
be
happy
happy
you
and
me
free
in
the
world
all
the
time
been
be
just
like
a
dream
that
past
a
waiting
time
afore
we
found
each
other
the
long
winter
afore
the
flowers
come
out
white
and
thick
on
the
moors
years
ago
he
took
me
it
too
long
to
change
i
never
do
his
work
no
more
but
it
like
as
if
be
my
master
just
the
same
till
i
die
listen
martin
listen
to
me
you
worked
all
your
life
for
him
ever
since
you
were
a
little
lad
early
and
late
been
at
the
works
working
working
for
him
gladly
now
and
then
he
give
you
a
kind
word
when
you
were
wearied
out
mebbe
and
your
thoughts
might
ha
turned
to
what
other
lives
were
wi
time
for
rest
and
pleasure
you
did
see
through
him
you
wi
your
big
heart
martin
you
were
too
near
to
see
like
i
was
till
mary
came
you
worked
gladly
maybe
but
all
the
time
your
life
was
going
into
rutherfords
your
manhood
into
the
place
built
he
had
you
martin
like
he
had
me
and
all
of
us
we
used
to
say
he
was
hard
and
bad
to
do
with
in
the
house
we
fell
silent
when
he
came
in
we
could
see
for
the
little
things
we
could
see
the
years
passing
because
of
the
days
and
all
the
time
it
was
our
lives
he
was
taking
bit
by
bit
our
lives
that
we
never
get
back
now
our
chance
at
last
he
turned
us
both
away
me
as
well
as
you
we
two
he
sent
out
into
the
world
together
free
he
done
it
himself
of
his
own
will
it
ours
to
take
martin
our
happiness
we
get
it
in
spite
of
him
he
kill
it
if
he
could
the
cruelty
of
it
that
the
rutherfords
never
kill
with
one
blow
never
so
merciful
are
they
in
their
ruthless
march
they
strangle
inch
by
inch
shed
the
blood
of
life
drop
by
drop
until
they
have
broken
the
very
spirit
of
man
and
made
him
as
helpless
and
pitiful
as
a
trembling
leaf
tossed
about
by
the
winds
a
picture
of
such
stirring
social
and
human
importance
that
no
one
except
he
who
has
reached
the
stage
of
can
escape
its
effect
yet
even
more
significant
is
the
inevitability
of
the
doom
of
the
rutherfords
as
embodied
in
the
wisdom
of
wife
when
her
husband
steals
his
father
money
a
very
small
part
indeed
compared
with
what
the
father
had
stolen
from
him
he
leaves
the
hateful
place
and
remains
to
face
the
master
for
the
sake
of
her
child
she
strikes
a
bargain
with
a
bargain
is
where
one
person
has
something
to
sell
that
another
wants
to
buy
there
no
love
in
it
only
money
money
that
pays
for
life
i
got
something
to
sell
that
you
want
to
buy
what
that
my
son
you
lost
everything
you
had
in
the
world
john
gone
and
richard
and
janet
they
wo
come
back
alone
now
and
getting
old
with
no
one
to
come
after
you
when
you
die
rutherfords
will
be
sold
somebody
buy
it
and
give
it
a
new
name
perhaps
and
no
one
will
even
remember
that
you
made
it
that
be
the
end
of
all
your
work
just
nothing
you
thought
of
that
it
for
my
boy
i
want
a
chance
of
life
for
him
his
place
in
the
world
john
ca
give
him
that
because
he
made
so
if
i
went
to
london
and
worked
my
hardest
i
get
shillings
a
week
we
failed
from
you
i
can
get
when
i
want
for
my
boy
i
want
all
the
good
common
things
a
good
house
good
food
warmth
he
a
delicate
little
thing
now
but
he
grow
strong
like
other
children
give
me
what
i
ask
and
in
return
i
give
you
him
on
one
condition
i
to
stay
on
here
i
trouble
you
you
need
speak
to
me
or
see
me
unless
you
want
to
for
ten
years
he
to
be
absolutely
mine
to
do
what
i
like
with
you
must
interfere
you
must
tell
him
to
do
things
or
frighten
him
he
mine
for
ten
years
more
and
after
that
he
be
yours
to
train
up
for
rutherfords
yes
after
all
after
dick
that
i
bullied
till
he
a
fool
john
that
wished
me
dead
in
ten
years
you
be
an
old
man
you
wo
be
able
to
make
people
afraid
of
you
any
more
when
i
saw
the
masterly
presentation
of
the
play
on
the
stage
bargain
looked
unreal
and
incongruous
it
seemed
impossible
to
me
that
a
mother
who
really
loves
her
child
should
want
it
to
be
in
any
way
connected
with
the
rutherfords
but
after
repeatedly
rereading
the
play
i
was
convinced
by
simple
statement
in
ten
years
be
an
old
man
you
wo
be
able
to
make
people
afraid
of
you
any
more
most
deeply
true
the
rutherfords
are
bound
by
time
by
the
eternal
forces
of
change
their
influence
on
human
life
is
indeed
terrible
notwithstanding
it
all
however
they
are
fighting
a
losing
game
they
are
growing
old
already
too
old
to
make
anyone
afraid
change
and
innovation
are
marching
on
and
the
rutherfords
must
make
place
for
the
young
generation
knocking
at
the
gates
the
irish
drama
william
butler
yeats
most
americans
know
about
the
irish
people
only
that
they
are
not
averse
to
drink
and
that
they
make
brutal
policemen
and
corrupt
politicians
but
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
revolutionary
movements
of
the
past
are
aware
of
the
fortitude
and
courage
aye
of
the
heroism
of
the
irish
manifested
during
their
uprisings
and
especially
in
the
fenian
movement
the
people
revolt
against
political
despotism
and
land
robbery
and
though
for
years
ireland
has
contributed
to
the
very
worst
features
of
american
life
those
interested
in
the
fate
of
its
people
did
not
despair
they
knew
that
the
spirit
of
unrest
in
ireland
was
not
appeased
and
that
it
would
make
itself
felt
again
in
no
uncertain
form
the
cultural
and
rebellious
awakening
in
that
country
within
the
last
years
once
more
proves
that
neither
god
nor
king
can
for
long
suppress
the
manifestation
of
the
latent
possibilities
of
a
people
the
possibilities
of
the
irish
must
indeed
be
great
if
they
could
inspire
the
rich
humor
of
a
lady
gregory
the
deep
symbolism
of
a
yeats
the
poetic
fancy
of
a
synge
and
the
rebellion
of
a
robinson
and
murray
only
a
people
unspoiled
by
the
dulling
hand
of
civilization
and
free
from
artifice
can
retain
such
simplicity
of
faith
and
remain
so
imaginative
so
full
of
fancy
and
dreams
wild
and
fiery
which
have
kindled
the
creative
spark
in
the
irish
dramatists
of
our
time
it
is
true
that
the
work
of
only
the
younger
element
among
them
is
of
social
significance
yet
all
of
them
have
rendered
their
people
and
the
rest
of
the
world
a
cultural
service
of
no
mean
value
william
butler
yeats
is
among
the
latter
together
with
synge
and
lady
gregory
his
art
though
deep
in
human
appeal
has
no
bearing
on
the
pressing
questions
of
our
time
yeats
himself
would
repudiate
any
implication
of
a
social
character
as
he
considers
such
dramas
too
topical
and
therefore
half
bad
plays
in
view
of
this
attitude
it
is
difficult
to
reconcile
his
standard
of
true
art
with
the
repertoire
of
the
abbey
theater
which
consists
mainly
of
social
dramas
still
more
difficult
is
it
to
account
for
his
work
where
there
is
nothing
which
is
no
less
social
in
its
philosophy
and
tendency
than
ibsen
brand
where
there
is
nothing
where
there
is
nothing
is
as
true
an
interpretation
of
the
philosophy
of
anarchism
as
could
be
given
by
its
best
exponents
i
say
this
not
out
of
any
wish
to
tag
yeats
but
because
the
ideal
of
the
hero
of
the
play
is
nothing
less
than
anarchism
applied
to
everyday
life
a
man
of
wealth
comes
to
the
conclusion
after
a
long
process
of
development
and
growth
that
riches
are
wrong
and
that
the
life
of
the
propertied
is
artificial
useless
and
inane
when
i
hear
these
people
talking
i
always
hear
some
organized
or
vested
interest
chirp
or
quack
as
it
does
in
the
newspapers
i
would
like
to
have
great
iron
claws
and
to
put
them
about
the
pillars
and
to
pull
and
pull
till
everything
fell
into
pieces
sometimes
i
dream
i
am
pulling
down
my
own
house
and
sometimes
it
is
the
whole
world
that
i
am
pulling
down
when
everything
was
pulled
down
we
would
have
more
room
to
get
drunk
in
to
drink
contentedly
out
of
the
cup
of
life
out
of
the
drunken
cup
of
life
he
decides
to
give
up
his
position
and
wealth
and
cast
his
lot
in
with
the
tinkers
an
element
we
in
america
know
as
hoboes
men
who
tramp
the
highways
making
their
living
as
they
go
about
mending
kettles
and
pots
earning
an
honest
penny
without
obligation
or
responsibility
to
anyone
longs
for
the
freedom
of
the
road
to
sleep
under
the
open
sky
to
count
the
stars
to
be
free
he
throws
off
all
artificial
restraint
and
is
received
with
open
arms
by
the
tinkers
to
identify
himself
more
closely
with
their
life
he
marries
a
daughter
not
according
to
the
rites
of
state
or
church
but
in
true
tinker
fashion
in
freedom
bound
only
by
the
promise
to
be
faithful
and
not
hurt
each
other
in
honor
of
the
occasion
tenders
to
his
comrades
and
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
a
grand
feast
full
of
the
spirit
of
life
joy
an
outpouring
of
gladness
that
lasts
a
whole
week
brother
his
friends
and
the
authorities
are
incensed
over
the
carousal
they
demand
that
he
terminate
the
drunken
orgy
this
is
a
disgraceful
business
paul
the
whole
countryside
is
demoralized
there
is
not
a
man
who
has
come
to
sensible
years
who
is
not
drunk
this
is
a
flagrant
violation
of
all
propriety
society
is
shaken
to
its
roots
my
own
servants
have
been
led
astray
by
the
free
drinks
that
are
being
given
in
the
village
my
butler
who
has
been
with
me
for
seven
years
has
not
been
seen
for
the
last
two
days
i
endorse
his
sentiments
completely
there
has
not
been
a
stroke
of
work
done
for
the
last
week
the
hay
is
lying
in
ridges
where
it
has
been
cut
there
is
not
a
man
to
be
found
to
water
the
cattle
it
is
impossible
to
get
as
much
as
a
horse
shod
in
the
village
i
think
have
something
to
say
colonel
lawley
i
have
undoubtedly
i
want
to
know
when
law
and
order
are
to
be
reÃ«stablished
the
police
have
been
quite
unable
to
cope
with
the
disorder
some
of
them
have
themselves
got
drunk
if
my
advice
had
been
taken
the
military
would
have
been
called
in
the
military
are
not
indispensable
on
occasions
like
the
present
there
are
plenty
of
police
coming
now
we
have
wired
to
dublin
for
them
they
will
be
here
by
the
four
train
but
you
have
not
told
me
what
you
have
come
here
for
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
we
have
come
to
request
you
to
go
to
the
to
stop
the
free
drinks
to
send
the
people
back
to
their
work
as
for
those
tinkers
the
law
will
deal
with
them
when
the
police
arrive
i
wanted
to
give
a
little
pleasure
to
my
this
seems
rather
a
low
form
of
pleasure
i
daresay
it
seems
to
you
a
little
violent
but
the
poor
have
very
few
hours
in
which
to
enjoy
themselves
they
must
take
their
pleasure
raw
they
have
the
time
to
cook
it
have
we
not
tried
sobriety
do
you
like
it
i
found
it
very
dull
think
what
it
is
to
them
to
have
their
imagination
like
a
blazing
for
a
whole
week
work
could
never
bring
them
such
blessedness
as
that
everyone
knows
there
is
no
more
valuable
blessing
than
work
decides
to
put
his
visitors
on
trial
to
let
them
see
themselves
as
they
are
in
all
their
hypocrisy
all
their
corruption
he
charges
the
military
man
with
calling
himself
a
christian
yet
following
the
business
of
the
colonel
is
forced
to
admit
that
he
had
ordered
his
men
to
fight
in
a
war
of
the
justice
of
which
they
knew
nothing
or
did
not
believe
in
and
yet
it
is
the
doctrine
of
your
christian
church
of
your
catholic
church
that
he
who
fights
in
an
unjust
war
knowing
it
to
be
unjust
loses
his
own
soul
of
the
rich
man
demands
whether
he
could
pass
through
the
inside
of
a
finger
ring
and
on
attention
being
called
by
one
of
the
tinkers
to
the
fine
coat
of
he
tells
him
to
help
himself
to
it
threatened
by
the
spokesman
of
the
law
with
encouraging
robbery
admonishes
him
remember
the
commandment
give
to
him
that
asketh
thee
and
the
hard
commandment
goes
even
farther
him
that
taketh
thy
cloak
forbid
not
to
take
thy
coat
also
but
the
worst
indictment
hurls
against
the
other
professed
christians
kill
murder
do
not
love
their
enemies
and
do
not
give
to
any
man
that
asks
of
them
but
the
greens
says
are
the
worst
of
all
for
the
others
break
the
law
of
christ
for
their
own
pleasure
but
you
take
pay
for
breaking
it
when
their
goods
are
taken
away
you
condemn
the
taker
when
they
are
smitten
on
one
cheek
you
punish
the
smiter
you
encourage
them
in
their
breaking
of
the
law
of
christ
for
several
years
lives
the
life
of
the
tinkers
but
of
weak
physique
he
finds
himself
unable
to
withstand
the
rigors
of
the
road
his
health
breaks
down
and
his
faithful
comrades
carry
him
to
his
native
town
and
bring
him
to
a
monastery
where
is
cared
for
by
the
priests
while
there
he
begins
to
preach
a
wonderful
gospel
a
gospel
strange
to
the
friars
and
the
superior
so
rebellious
and
terrible
that
he
is
declared
a
dissenter
a
heathen
and
a
dangerous
character
now
i
can
give
you
the
message
that
has
come
to
me
lay
down
your
palm
branches
before
this
altar
you
have
brought
them
as
a
sign
that
the
walls
are
beginning
to
be
broken
up
that
we
are
going
back
to
the
joy
of
the
green
earth
for
a
long
time
after
their
making
men
and
women
wandered
here
and
there
half
blind
from
the
drunkenness
of
eternity
they
had
not
yet
forgotten
that
the
green
earth
was
the
love
of
god
and
that
all
life
was
the
will
of
god
and
so
they
wept
and
laughed
and
hated
according
to
the
impulse
of
their
hearts
they
gathered
the
great
earth
to
their
breasts
and
their
lips
in
what
they
believed
would
be
an
eternal
kiss
it
was
then
that
the
temptation
began
the
men
and
women
listened
to
them
and
because
when
they
had
lived
in
mother
wit
and
natural
kindness
they
sometimes
did
one
another
an
injury
they
thought
that
it
would
be
better
to
be
safe
than
to
be
blessed
they
made
the
laws
the
laws
were
the
first
sin
they
were
the
first
mouthful
of
the
apple
the
moment
man
had
made
them
he
began
to
die
we
must
put
out
the
laws
as
i
put
out
this
candle
and
when
they
had
lived
amidst
the
green
earth
that
is
the
love
of
god
they
were
sometimes
wetted
by
the
rain
and
sometimes
cold
and
hungry
and
sometimes
alone
from
one
another
they
thought
it
would
be
better
to
be
comfortable
than
to
be
blessed
they
began
to
build
big
houses
and
big
towns
they
grew
wealthy
and
they
sat
chattering
at
their
doors
and
the
embrace
that
was
to
have
been
eternal
ended
we
must
put
out
the
towns
as
i
put
out
this
candle
but
that
is
not
all
for
man
created
a
worse
thing
man
built
up
the
church
we
must
destroy
the
church
we
must
put
it
out
as
i
put
out
this
candle
we
must
destroy
everything
that
has
law
and
number
the
rebel
is
driven
from
the
monastery
he
is
followed
by
only
two
faithful
friars
his
disciples
who
go
among
the
people
to
disseminate
the
new
gospel
but
the
people
fail
to
understand
them
immersed
in
darkness
and
superstition
they
look
upon
these
strange
men
as
evildoers
they
accuse
them
of
casting
an
evil
spell
on
their
cattle
and
disturbing
the
people
peace
the
path
of
the
crusader
is
thorny
and
the
friar
disciple
of
though
faithful
for
a
time
become
discouraged
in
the
face
of
opposition
and
persecution
he
weakens
it
no
use
stopping
waiting
for
the
wind
if
we
have
anything
to
say
that
worth
the
people
listening
to
we
must
bring
them
to
hear
it
one
way
or
another
now
it
is
what
i
was
saying
to
aloysius
we
must
begin
teaching
them
to
make
things
they
never
had
the
chance
of
any
instruction
of
this
sort
here
those
and
other
things
we
got
a
good
training
in
the
old
days
and
we
get
a
grant
from
the
technical
board
the
board
pays
up
to
four
hundred
pounds
to
some
of
its
instructors
oh
i
understand
you
will
sell
them
and
what
about
the
dividing
of
the
money
you
will
need
to
make
laws
about
that
oh
we
will
grow
quite
rich
in
time
we
build
workshops
and
houses
for
those
who
come
to
work
from
a
distance
good
houses
slated
not
thatched
they
will
think
so
much
more
of
our
teaching
when
we
have
got
them
under
our
influence
by
other
things
of
course
we
will
teach
them
their
meditations
and
give
them
a
regular
religious
life
we
must
settle
out
some
little
place
for
them
to
pray
in
there
a
high
gable
over
there
where
we
could
hang
a
bell
oh
yes
i
understand
you
would
weave
them
together
like
this
you
would
add
one
thing
to
another
laws
and
money
and
church
and
bells
till
you
had
got
everything
back
again
that
you
have
escaped
from
but
it
is
my
business
to
tear
things
asunder
brother
paul
it
is
what
i
am
thinking
now
the
tinkers
have
come
back
to
you
you
could
begin
to
gather
a
sort
of
an
army
you
ca
fight
your
battle
without
an
army
they
would
call
to
the
other
tinkers
and
the
tramps
and
the
beggars
and
the
and
all
the
wandering
people
it
would
be
a
great
army
yes
that
would
be
a
great
army
a
great
wandering
army
the
people
would
be
afraid
to
refuse
us
then
we
would
march
on
we
could
march
on
we
could
march
on
the
towns
and
we
could
break
up
all
settled
order
we
could
bring
back
the
old
joyful
dangerous
individual
life
we
would
have
banners
we
will
have
one
great
banner
that
will
go
in
front
it
will
take
two
men
to
carry
it
and
on
it
we
will
have
laughter
that
will
be
the
banner
for
the
front
we
will
have
different
troops
we
will
have
captains
to
organize
them
to
give
them
orders
to
organize
that
is
to
bring
in
law
and
number
organize
organize
that
is
how
all
the
mischief
has
been
done
i
was
forgetting
we
can
not
destroy
the
world
with
armies
it
is
inside
our
minds
that
it
must
be
destroyed
deserted
stands
alone
in
his
crusade
like
most
iconoclasts
misunderstood
and
persecuted
he
finally
meets
his
death
at
the
hands
of
the
infuriated
mob
where
there
is
nothing
is
of
great
social
significance
deeply
revolutionary
in
the
sense
that
it
carries
the
message
of
the
destruction
of
every
institution
state
property
and
church
that
enslaves
humanity
where
there
is
nothing
there
man
a
certain
critic
characterized
this
play
as
a
statement
of
revolt
against
the
despotism
of
facts
is
there
a
despotism
more
compelling
and
destructive
than
that
of
the
facts
of
property
of
the
state
and
church
but
where
there
is
nothing
is
not
merely
a
statement
of
revolt
it
embodies
the
spirit
of
revolt
itself
of
that
most
constructive
revolt
which
begins
with
the
destruction
of
every
obstacle
in
the
path
of
the
new
life
that
is
to
grow
on
the
dÃ©bris
of
the
old
when
the
paralyzing
yoke
of
institutionalism
shall
have
been
broken
and
man
left
free
to
enjoy
life
and
laughter
lenox

an
old

all
his
life
and
mortgages

farm

order
to
enable
his
children
to
lead
an
idle
parasitic
life

on
this
road

culture

the
children
leave
their
father

establish
themselves
in
society

chemist
respectively
the
secretary
son
is
ashamed
of
his
lowly
origin
and
denies
it
the
lawyer

is
much
more
concerned
with
his
motor

than
with
the
condition
of
the
farm

has

but
when
they
return
after
an
absence
of
years
they
find
themselves
out
of
touch
with
farm
life
and
they
too
turn
their
back
on
their
native
heath
notion
of
the
country
is
that
of
most
city
people
nature
is
beautiful
the
scenery
lovely
so
long
as
it
is
someone
else
who
has
to
labor
in
the
scorching
sun
to
plow
and
toil
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow
and
his
wife
are
both
extremely
romantic
about
the
farm
it
stands
to
reason
farming
must
pay
enormously
take
a
field
of
oats
for
instance
every
grain
that
sown
gives
a
huge
percentage
in
return
i
do
know
exactly
how
many
grains
a
stalk
carries
but
several
hundred
i
sure
why
there
no
investment
in
the
world
would
give
you
a
return
like
that
but
soon
they
discover
that
every
grain
of
corn
does
not
yield
hundreds
of
dollars
you
ca
have
a
solicitor
and
a
priest
and
a
chemist
in
a
family
without
spending
money
and
for
the
last
ten
years
you
been
all
drawing
money
out
of
the
farm
there
no
more
to
drain
now
oh
i
suppose
you
think
i
a
bloody
fool
not
to
be
able
to
make
it
pay
but
sure
what
chance
have
i
and
i
never
taught
how
to
farm
there
was
money
and
education
wanted
to
make
priests
and
doctors
and
gentlemen
of
you
all
and
was
there
money
and
education
wanted
to
make
a
farmer
of
me
no
nothing
taught
me
only
what
i
picked
up
from
my
father
and
the
men
and
never
a
bit
of
fresh
money
to
put
into
the
farm
only
it
all
kept
to
make
a
solicitor
of
bob
and
a
chemist
of
you
during
visit
to
the
farm
a
fire
breaks
out
and
several
buildings
on
the
place
are
destroyed
much
to
the
horror
of
the
he
learns
that
his
father
himself
had
lit
the
match
in
order
to
get
compensation
he
sternly
upbraids
the
old
farmer
did
you
see
yourself
how
dishonest
it
was
maybe
i
did
but
i
saw
something
more
and
that
was
that
i
was
on
the
way
to
being
put
out
of
the
farm
is
outraged
he
threatens
to
inform
on
his
own
people
and
offers
to
stay
on
the
farm
to
help
with
the
work
but
two
weeks
experience
in
the
field
beneath
the
burning
sun
is
more
than
delicate
can
stand
he
suffers
fainting
spells
and
is
in
the
end
prevailed
upon
by
his
wife
to
leave
old
daughter
also
returns
to
the
farm
for
rest
and
quiet
but
she
finds
no
peace
there
for
the
city
is
too
much
in
her
blood
there
is
moreover
another
lure
she
can
not
escape
i
was
too
well
educated
to
be
a
servant
and
i
was
never
happy
as
one
so
to
better
myself
i
learned
typing
it
a
hard
life
jack
and
i
soon
found
out
how
hard
it
was
and
i
was
as
dissatisfied
as
ever
then
there
only
seemed
one
way
out
of
it
and
he
my
employer
i
mean
i
went
into
it
deliberately
with
my
eyes
open
you
see
a
woman
i
knew
chucked
typing
and
went
in
for
this
and
i
saw
what
a
splendid
time
she
had
and
how
happy
she
was
and
i
was
so
miserably
unhappy
and
how
she
had
everything
she
wanted
and
i
had
nothing
and
and
but
this
life
made
me
unhappy
too
and
so
in
desperation
i
came
home
but
i
grown
too
far
away
from
it
all
and
now
i
going
back
do
you
see
jack
i
not
happy
here
i
thought
if
i
could
get
home
to
the
farm
and
the
old
simple
life
it
would
be
all
right
but
it
is
everything
jars
on
me
the
roughness
and
the
hard
living
and
the
coarse
food
oh
it
seems
ridiculous
but
they
make
me
physically
ill
i
always
thought
if
i
could
get
away
home
to
knockmalgloss
i
could
start
fair
again
so
i
came
home
and
everything
is
the
same
and
everyone
thinks
that
i
as
pure
and
innocent
as
when
i
went
away
but
but
but
jack
the
dreadful
thing
is
i
want
to
go
back
i
longing
for
that
life
and
its
excitement
and
splendor
and
color
in
her
misery
and
struggle
a
great
faith
sustains
and
keeps
her
from
ruin
it
is
the
thought
of
her
father
in
whom
she
believes
implicitly
as
her
ideal
of
honesty
strength
and
incorruptibility
the
shock
is
terrible
when
she
learns
that
her
father
even
her
father
has
fallen
a
victim
to
the
cruel
struggle
of
life
that
her
father
himself
set
fire
to
the
buildings
and
i
thought
he
was
so
simple
so
innocent
so
unspoiled
father
the
simple
honest
peasant
the
only
decent
one
of
us
i
cried
all
last
night
at
the
contrast
his
unselfishness
his
simplicity
why
we
all
equally
bad
now
he
and
i
we
both
sell
ourselves
he
for
the
price
of
those
old
houses
and
i
for
a
few
years
of
splendor
and
happiness
the
only
one
whom
life
seems
to
teach
nothing
is
oblivious
of
the
stress
and
storm
of
reality
he
continues
to
be
enraptured
with
education
with
culture
with
the
opportunities
offered
by
the
large
cities
he
is
particularly
proud
of
the
hurley
children
the
way
you
all
got
on
i
tell
you
what
if
every
boy
and
girl
i
ever
taught
had
turned
out
a
failure
i
feel
content
and
satisfied
when
i
looked
at
all
of
you
and
saw
what
i
made
of
you
what
you
made
of
us
i
wonder
do
you
really
know
what
you
made
of
us
is
it
easily
seen
one
with
a
motor
car
no
less
it
was
good
sound
seed
i
sowed
long
ago
in
the
little
schoolhouse
and
it
you
all
reaping
the
harvest
harvest
is
a
grim
picture
of
civilization
in
its
especially
demoralizing
effects
upon
the
people
who
spring
from
the
soil
the
mock
culture
and
shallow
education
which
inspire
peasant
folk
with
awe
which
lure
the
children
away
from
home
only
to
crush
the
vitality
out
of
them
or
to
turn
them
into
cowards
and
compromisers
the
tragedy
of
a
civilization
that
dooms
the
tillers
of
the
soil
to
a
dreary
monotony
of
hard
toil
with
little
return
or
charms
them
to
destruction
with
the
false
glow
of
city
culture
and
ease
greater
still
this
tragedy
in
a
country
like
ireland
its
people
taxed
to
the
very
marrow
and
exploited
to
the
verge
of
starvation
leaving
the
young
generation
no
opening
no
opportunity
in
life
it
is
inevitable
that
the
sons
and
daughters
of
ireland
robust
in
body
and
spirit
yearning
for
things
better
and
bigger
should
desert
her
for
as
says
when
the
sun
sets
here
it
all
so
dark
and
cold
and
dreary
but
the
young
need
light
and
warmth
and
these
are
not
in
the
valley
of
misery
and
want
harvest
is
an
expressive
picture
of
the
social
background
of
the
irish
people
a
background
somber
and
unpromising
but
for
the
streak
of
dawn
that
pierces
that
country
dark
horizon
in
the
form
of
the
inherent
and
irrepressible
fighting
spirit
of
the
true
irishman
the
spirit
of
the
fenian
revolt
whose
fires
often
slumber
but
are
never
put
out
all
the
ravages
of
our
false
civilization
notwithstanding
murray
maurice
harte
maurice
harte
portrays
the
most
sinister
force
which
holds
the
irish
people
in
awe
that
heaviest
of
all
bondage
priestcraft
his
wife
and
their
son
are
bent
on
one
purpose
to
make
a
priest
of
their
youngest
child
the
mother
especially
has
no
other
ambition
in
life
than
to
see
her
son
priested
no
higher
ideal
to
most
catholic
mothers
than
to
consecrate
their
favorite
son
to
the
glory
of
god
what
it
has
cost
the
hartes
to
attain
their
ambition
and
hope
is
revealed
by
in
the
conversation
with
her
sister
and
later
with
her
husband
when
he
informs
her
that
he
can
not
borrow
any
more
money
to
continue
the
boy
in
the
seminary
if
michael
and
myself
have
our
son
nearly
a
priest
this
day
is
no
small
price
at
all
we
have
paid
for
it
it
the
terrible
thing
every
time
you
look
through
that
window
to
have
the
fear
in
your
heart
that
is
the
you
see
and
he
coming
up
the
boreen
impoverishes
himself
to
enable
his
son
to
finish
his
studies
he
has
borrowed
right
and
left
till
his
resources
are
now
entirety
exhausted
but
he
is
compelled
to
try
another
loan
he
made
out
was
as
good
as
insulting
him
making
such
a
small
payment
and
the
money
that
on
us
to
be
so
heavy
if
you
do
wish
to
sign
that
note
says
he
you
need
it
matter
at
all
to
me
one
way
or
the
other
for
before
the
next
quarter
sessions
is
andy
driscoll
the
will
be
marching
up
to
your
door
so
what
could
i
do
but
sign
why
was
how
he
turned
on
me
in
a
red
passion
and
is
it
a
scandal
michael
harte
says
he
for
the
like
o
you
with
your
name
on
them
books
there
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
you
with
only
the
grass
of
nine
or
ten
cows
to
be
making
your
son
a
priest
the
like
of
it
says
he
was
never
heard
of
before
what
business
was
it
of
his
i
like
to
know
jealous
of
us
there
no
fear
any
of
his
sons
will
ever
be
anything
much
i
was
thinking
it
might
do
maurice
some
harm
with
the
bishop
if
it
came
out
on
the
papers
that
we
were
up
before
the
judge
for
a
civil
bill
is
once
or
twice
i
told
you
that
i
had
my
heart
set
on
hearing
maurice
say
the
marriage
words
over
his
own
brother
comes
home
for
the
summer
vacation
looking
pale
and
emaciated
his
mother
ascribes
his
condition
to
the
bad
city
air
and
hard
study
at
school
but
suffers
from
a
different
cause
his
is
a
mental
struggle
the
maddening
struggle
of
doubt
the
realization
that
he
has
lost
his
faith
that
he
has
no
vocation
and
that
he
must
give
up
his
divinity
studies
he
knows
how
fanatically
bent
his
people
are
on
having
him
ordained
and
he
is
tortured
by
the
grief
his
decision
will
cause
his
parents
his
heart
is
breaking
as
he
at
last
determines
to
inform
them
he
reasons
and
pleads
with
his
parents
and
implores
them
not
to
drive
him
back
to
college
but
they
can
not
understand
they
remain
deaf
to
his
arguments
pitifully
they
beg
him
not
to
fail
them
not
to
disappoint
the
hope
of
a
lifetime
when
it
all
proves
of
no
avail
they
finally
disclose
to
their
gnawing
secret
the
farm
has
been
mortgaged
and
many
debts
incurred
for
the
sake
of
enabling
him
to
attain
to
the
priesthood
maurice
would
you
break
our
hearts
father
would
you
have
your
son
live
a
life
of
sacrilege

bit

bailiffs

in
that
door
the
whole
world

june
and
only
for
the
great
respect
they
have
for
us
through
the
means
o
that
is
james
mccarthy
alone
but
every
other
one
o
them

come
down
on

their
money
in
one
week
there

be
a

do
ask

i
ever
face

this
door
or
lift
my
head

how
could
i
listen
to
the
neighbors
making
pity
for

and
many
a
one
o
them
only
glad
in
their
hearts
how
could
i
ever
face
again
into
town
o
macroom
oh
do
i
tell
you
maurice
i
rather
be
lying
dead
a
thousand
times
in
the
graveyard
over
killnamartyra
stop
mother
stop
i
i
go
back
as
as
you
all
wish
it
nine
months
later
there
is
general
rejoicing
at
the
hartes
has
passed
his
examinations
with
flying
colors
he
is
about
to
be
ordained
and
he
is
to
officiate
at
the
wedding
of
his
brother
and
his
wealthy
bride
plans
to
give
her
son
a
royal
welcome
great
preparations
are
on
foot
to
greet
the
return
of
he
comes
back
not
in
the
glory
and
triumph
expected
by
his
people
but
a
driveling
idiot
his
mental
struggle
the
agony
of
whipping
himself
to
the
hated
task
proved
too
much
for
him
and
is
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
superstition
and
submission
to
paternal
authority
in
the
whole
range
of
the
irish
drama
maurice
harte
is
the
most
irish
because
nowhere
does
catholicism
demand
so
many
victims
as
in
that
unfortunate
land
but
in
a
deeper
sense
the
play
is
of
that
social
importance
that
knows
no
limit
of
race
or
creed
there
is
no
boundary
of
land
or
time
to
the
resistance
of
the
human
mind
to
coercion
it
is
worldwide
equally
so
is
the
rebellion
of
youth
against
the
tyranny
of
parents
but
above
all
does
this
play
mirror
the
narrow
ambitious
love
of
the
mother
so
disastrous
to
the
happiness
and
peace
of
her
child
for
it
is
rather
than
the
father
who
forces
back
to
his
studies
from
whatever
viewpoint
however
maurice
harte
be
considered
it
carries
a
dramatically
powerful
message
of
wide
social
significance
the
russian
drama
people
outside
of
russia
especially
have
one
great
objection
to
the
russian
drama
it
is
too
sad
too
gloomy
it
is
often
asked
why
is
the
russian
drama
so
pessimistic
the
answer
is
the
russian
drama
like
all
russian
culture
has
been
conceived
in
the
sorrow
of
the
people
it
was
born
in
their
woe
and
struggle
anything
thus
conceived
can
not
be
very
joyous
or
amusing
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
in
no
other
country
are
the
creative
artists
so
interwoven
so
much
at
one
with
the
people
this
is
not
only
true
of
men
like
turgenev
tolstoy
and
the
dramatists
of
modern
times
it
applies
also
to
gogol
who
in
the
inspector
and
dead
souls
spoke
in
behalf
of
the
people
appealing
to
the
conscience
of
russia
the
same
is
true
of
dostoyevsky
of
the
poets
nekrassov
nadson
and
others
in
fact
all
the
great
russian
artists
have
gone
to
the
people
for
their
inspiration
as
to
the
source
of
all
life
that
explains
the
depth
and
the
humanity
of
russian
literature
the
modern
drama
naturally
suggests
henrik
ibsen
as
its
pioneer
but
prior
to
him
gogol
utilized
the
drama
as
a
vehicle
for
popularizing
the
social
issues
of
his
time
in
the
inspector
he
portrays
the
corruption
graft
and
extortion
rampant
in
the
governmental
departments
if
we
were
to
anglicize
the
names
of
the
characters
in
the
inspector
and
forget
for
a
moment
that
it
was
a
russian
who
wrote
the
play
the
criticism
contained
therein
would
apply
with
similar
force
to
america
and
to
every
other
modern
country
gogol
touched
the
deepest
sores
of
social
magnitude
and
marked
the
beginning
of
the
realistic
drama
in
russia
however
it
is
not
within
the
scope
of
this
work
to
discuss
the
drama
of
gogol
era
i
shall
begin
with
tolstoy
because
he
is
closer
to
our
own
generation
and
voices
more
definitely
the
social
significance
of
the
modern
drama
tolstoy
when
leo
tolstoy
died
the
representatives
of
the
church
proclaimed
him
as
their
own
he
was
with
us
they
said
it
reminds
one
of
the
russian
fable
about
the
fly
and
the
ox
the
fly
was
lazily
resting
on
the
horn
of
the
ox
while
he
plowed
the
field
but
when
the
ox
returned
home
exhausted
with
toil
the
fly
bragged
have
been
plowing
the
spokesmen
of
the
church
are
in
relation
to
tolstoy
in
the
same
position
it
is
true
that
tolstoy
based
his
conception
of
human
relationships
on
a
new
interpretation
of
the
gospels
but
he
was
as
far
removed
from
christianity
as
jesus
was
alien
to
the
institutional
religion
of
his
time
tolstoy
was
the
last
true
christian
and
as
such
he
undermined
the
stronghold
of
the
church
with
all
its
pernicious
power
of
darkness
with
all
its
injustice
and
cruelty
for
this
he
was
persecuted
by
the
holy
synod
and
excommunicated
from
the
church
for
this
he
was
feared
by
the
tsar
and
his
henchmen
for
this
his
works
have
been
condemned
and
prohibited
the
only
reason
tolstoy
himself
escaped
the
fate
of
other
great
russians
was
that
he
was
mightier
than
the
church
mightier
than
the
ducal
clique
mightier
even
than
the
tsar
he
was
the
powerful
conscience
of
russia
exposing
her
crimes
and
evils
before
the
civilized
world
how
deeply
tolstoy
felt
the
grave
problems
of
his
time
how
closely
related
he
was
to
the
people
he
demonstrated
in
various
works
but
in
none
so
strikingly
as
in
the
power
of
darkness
the
power
of
darkness
the
power
of
darkness
is
the
tragedy
of
sordid
misery
and
dense
ignorance
it
deals
with
a
group
of
peasants
steeped
in
poverty
and
utter
darkness
this
appalling
condition
especially
in
relation
to
the
women
folk
is
expressed
by
one
of
the
characters
in
the
play
there
are
millions
of
you
women
and
girls
but
you
are
all
like
the
beasts
of
the
forest
just
as
one
has
been
born
so
she
dies
she
has
neither
seen
or
heard
anything
a
man
will
learn
something
if
nowhere
else
at
least
in
the
inn
or
by
some
chance
in
prison
or
in
the
army
as
i
have
but
what
about
a
woman
she
does
not
know
a
thing
about
god
nay
she
does
not
know
one
day
from
another
they
creep
about
like
blind
pups
and
stick
their
heads
into
the
manure
a
rich
peasant
is
in
a
dying
condition
yet
he
clings
to
his
money
and
his
young
wife
his
two
daughters
by
a
first
marriage
and
his
peasant
servant
he
will
not
allow
them
any
rest
from
their
toil
for
the
greed
of
money
is
in
his
blood
and
the
fear
of
death
in
his
bones
hates
her
husband
he
forces
her
to
drudge
and
he
is
old
and
she
loves
the
latter
young
and
irresponsible
can
not
resist
women
who
are
his
main
weakness
and
final
undoing
before
he
came
to
old
farm
he
had
wronged
an
orphan
girl
when
she
becomes
pregnant
she
appeals
to
father
a
simple
and
honest
peasant
he
urges
his
son
to
marry
the
girl
because
it
is
a
sin
to
wrong
an
orphan
look
out
nikita
a
tear
of
offense
does
not
flow
past
but
upon
a
man
head
look
out
or
the
same
will
happen
with
you
kindness
and
simplicity
are
opposed
by
the
viciousness
and
greed
of
his
wife
remains
on
the
farm
and
urged
and
influenced
by
his
mother
poisons
old
and
steals
his
money
when
her
husband
dies
marries
and
turns
the
money
over
to
him
becomes
the
head
of
the
house
and
soon
proves
himself
a
rake
and
a
tyrant
idleness
and
affluence
undermine
whatever
good
is
latent
in
him
money
the
destroyer
of
souls
together
with
the
consciousness
that
he
has
been
indirectly
a
party
to
crime
turn
love
for
the
woman
into
bitter
hatred
he
takes
for
his
mistress
oldest
daughter
a
girl
of
sixteen
deaf
and
silly
and
forces
to
serve
them
she
had
strength
to
resist
her
old
husband
but
her
love
for
has
made
her
weak
the
moment
i
see
him
my
heart
softens
i
have
no
courage
against
him
old
comes
to
ask
for
a
little
money
from
his
newly
rich
son
he
quickly
senses
the
swamp
of
corruption
and
vice
into
which
has
sunk
he
tries
to
save
him
to
bring
him
back
to
himself
to
arouse
the
better
side
of
his
nature
but
he
fails
the
ways
of
life
are
too
evil
for
he
leaves
refusing
even
the
money
he
needs
so
badly
to
purchase
a
horse
one
sin
holds
on
to
another
and
pulls
you
along
nikita
you
are
stuck
in
sins
you
are
stuck
i
see
in
sins
you
are
stuck
fast
so
to
speak
i
have
heard
that
nowadays
they
pull
beards
so
to
speak
but
this
leads
only
to
ruin
to
ruin
so
to
speak
there
is
your
money
i
will
go
and
beg
so
to
speak
but
i
will
not
so
to
speak
take
the
money
let
me
go
i
will
not
stay
i
would
rather
sleep
near
the
fence
than
in
your
nastiness
the
type
of
is
most
vividly
characterized
by
tolstoy
in
the
talk
between
the
old
peasant
and
the
new
help
on
the
farm
let
us
suppose
for
example
you
have
money
and
i
for
example
have
my
land
lying
fallow
it
is
spring
and
i
have
no
seed
or
i
have
to
pay
the
taxes
so
i
come
to
you
and
say
akim
give
me
ten
roubles
i
will
have
the
harvest
in
by
intercession
and
then
i
will
give
it
back
to
you
with
a
tithe
for
the
accommodation
you
for
example
see
that
i
can
be
flayed
having
a
horse
or
a
cow
so
you
say
give
me
two
or
three
roubles
for
the
accommodation
the
noose
is
around
my
neck
and
i
can
not
get
along
without
it
very
well
says
i
i
will
take
the
ten
roubles
in
the
fall
i
sell
some
things
and
i
bring
you
the
money
and
you
skin
me
in
addition
for
three
roubles
but
this
is
so
to
speak
a
wrong
done
to
a
peasant
if
one
forgets
god
so
to
speak
it
is
not
good
wait
a
minute
so
remember
what
you
have
done
you
have
fleeced
me
so
to
speak
and
anisya
for
example
has
some
money
which
is
lying
idle
she
has
no
place
to
put
it
in
and
being
a
woman
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
so
she
comes
to
you
i
says
she
make
some
use
of
my
money
yes
you
can
you
say
and
so
you
wait
next
summer
i
come
to
you
once
more
give
me
another
ten
roubles
says
i
and
i
will
pay
you
for
the
accommodation
so
you
watch
me
to
see
whether
my
hide
has
not
been
turned
yet
whether
i
can
be
flayed
again
and
if
i
can
you
give
me
anisya
money
but
if
i
have
not
a
blessed
thing
and
nothing
to
eat
you
make
your
calculations
seeing
that
i
can
not
be
skinned
and
you
say
god
be
with
you
my
brother
and
you
look
out
for
another
man
to
whom
to
give
anisya
money
and
whom
you
can
flay
now
this
is
called
a
bank
so
it
keeps
going
around
it
is
a
very
clever
thing
my
friend
what
is
this
this
is
a
nastiness
so
to
speak
if
a
peasant
so
to
speak
were
to
do
it
the
peasants
would
regard
it
as
a
sin
so
to
speak
this
is
not
according
to
the
law
not
according
to
the
law
so
to
speak
it
is
bad
how
can
the
learned
men
so
to
speak
as
i
look
at
it
so
to
speak
there
is
trouble
without
money
so
to
speak
and
with
money
the
trouble
is
double
so
to
speak
god
has
commanded
to
work
but
you
put
the
money
in
the
bank
so
to
speak
and
lie
down
to
sleep
and
the
money
will
feed
you
so
to
speak
while
you
are
lying
this
is
bad
not
according
to
the
law
so
to
speak
not
according
to
the
law
the
law
does
not
trouble
people
nowadays
my
friend
all
they
think
about
is
how
to
clean
out
a
fellow
that
what
as
long
as
condition
is
not
noticeable
the
relation
of
with
his
dead
master
daughter
remains
hidden
from
the
neighbors
but
the
time
comes
when
she
is
to
give
birth
to
a
child
it
is
then
that
becomes
mistress
of
the
situation
again
her
hatred
for
her
outraged
love
for
and
the
evil
spirit
of
mother
all
combine
to
turn
her
into
a
fiend
is
driven
to
the
barn
where
her
terrible
labor
pains
are
stifled
by
the
dread
of
her
stepmother
when
the
innocent
victim
is
born
vicious
mother
and
persuade
him
that
the
child
is
dead
and
force
him
to
bury
it
in
the
cellar
while
is
digging
the
grave
he
discovers
the
deception
the
child
is
alive
the
terrible
shock
unnerves
the
man
and
in
temporary
madness
he
presses
a
board
over
the
little
body
till
its
bones
crunch
superstition
horror
and
the
perfidy
of
the
women
drive
to
drink
in
an
attempt
to
drown
the
baby
cries
constantly
ringing
in
his
ears
the
last
act
deals
with
wedding
to
the
son
of
a
neighbor
she
is
forced
into
the
marriage
because
of
her
misfortune
the
peasants
all
gather
for
the
occasion
but
is
missing
he
roams
the
place
haunted
by
the
horrible
phantom
of
his
murdered
child
he
attempts
to
hang
himself
but
fails
and
finally
decides
to
go
before
the
entire
assembly
to
confess
his
crimes
father
listen
to
me
first
of
all
marina
look
at
me
i
am
guilty
toward
you
i
had
promised
to
marry
you
and
i
seduced
you
i
deceived
you
and
abandoned
you
forgive
me
for
christ
sake
oh
oh
he
is
bewitched
what
is
the
matter
with
him
he
has
the
evil
eye
upon
him
get
up
and
stop
talking
nonsense
i
killed
your
father
and
i
dog
have
ruined
his
daughter
i
had
the
power
over
her
and
i
killed
also
her
baby
father
dear
forgive
me
sinful
man
you
told
me
when
i
first
started
on
this
life
of
debauch
when
the
claw
is
caught
the
whole
bird
is
lost
but
i
dog
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
you
and
so
everything
turned
out
as
you
said
forgive
me
for
christ
sake
the
power
of
darkness
is
a
terrible
picture
of
poverty
ignorance
and
superstition
to
write
such
a
work
it
is
not
sufficient
to
be
a
creative
artist
it
requires
a
deeply
sympathetic
human
soul
tolstoy
possessed
both
he
understood
that
the
tragedy
of
the
peasants
life
is
due
not
to
any
inherent
viciousness
but
to
the
power
of
darkness
which
permeates
their
existence
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
something
heavy
is
oppressing
them
in
the
words
of
weighing
them
down
something
that
saps
all
humanity
out
of
them
and
drives
them
into
the
depths
the
power
of
darkness
is
a
social
picture
at
once
appalling
and
gripping
anton
tchekhof
when
anton
tchekhof
first
came
to
the
fore
no
less
an
authority
than
tolstoy
said
russia
has
given
birth
to
another
turgenev
the
estimate
was
not
overdrawn
tchekhof
was
indeed
a
modern
turgenev
perhaps
not
as
universal
because
turgenev
having
lived
in
western
europe
in
close
contact
with
conditions
outside
of
russia
dealt
with
more
variegated
aspects
of
life
but
as
a
creative
artist
tchekhof
is
fitted
to
take
his
place
with
turgenev
tchekhof
is
preÃ«minently
the
master
of
short
stories
within
the
limits
of
a
few
pages
he
paints
the
drama
of
human
life
with
its
manifold
tragic
and
comic
colors
in
its
most
intimate
reflex
upon
the
characters
who
pass
through
the
panorama
he
has
been
called
a
pessimist
as
if
one
could
miss
the
sun
without
feeling
the
torture
of
utter
darkness
tchekhof
wrote
during
the
gloomiest
period
of
russian
life
at
a
time
when
the
reaction
had
drowned
the
revolution
in
the
blood
of
the
young
generation
when
the
tsar
had
choked
the
very
breath
out
of
young
russia
the
intellectuals
were
deprived
of
every
outlet
all
the
social
channels
were
closed
to
them
and
they
found
themselves
without
hope
or
faith
not
having
yet
learned
to
make
common
cause
with
the
people
tchekhof
could
not
escape
the
atmosphere
which
darkened
the
horizon
of
almost
the
whole
of
russia
it
was
because
he
so
intensely
felt
its
oppressive
weight
that
he
longed
for
air
for
light
for
new
and
vital
ideas
to
awaken
the
same
yearning
and
faith
in
others
he
had
to
picture
life
as
it
was
in
all
its
wretchedness
and
horror
this
he
did
in
the
seagull
while
in
the
cherry
orchard
he
holds
out
the
hope
of
a
new
and
brighter
day
the
seagull
in
the
seagull
the
young
artist
seeks
new
forms
new
modes
of
expression
he
is
tired
of
the
old
academic
ways
the
beaten
track
he
is
disgusted
with
the
endless
imitative
methods
no
one
apparently
capable
of
an
original
thought
has
written
a
play
the
principal
part
is
to
be
acted
by
a
beautiful
girl
with
whom
is
in
love
he
arranges
the
first
performance
to
take
place
on
the
occasion
of
his
vacation
in
the
country
she
herself
known
as
is
a
famous
actress
of
the
old
school
she
knows
how
to
show
off
her
charms
to
advantage
to
parade
her
beautiful
gowns
to
faint
and
die
gracefully
before
the
footlights
but
she
does
not
know
how
to
live
her
part
on
the
stage
is
the
type
of
artist
who
lacks
all
conception
of
the
relation
between
art
and
life
barren
of
vision
and
empty
of
heart
her
only
criterion
is
public
approval
and
material
success
needless
to
say
she
can
not
understand
her
son
she
considers
him
decadent
a
foolish
rebel
who
wants
to
undermine
the
settled
canons
of
dramatic
art
sums
up
his
mother
personality
in
the
following
manner
she
is
a
psychological
curiosity
is
my
mother
a
clever
and
gifted
woman
who
can
cry
over
a
novel
will
reel
you
off
all
nekrassov
poems
by
heart
and
is
the
perfection
of
a
sick
nurse
but
venture
to
praise
eleonora
duse
before
her
oho
ho
you
must
praise
nobody
but
her
write
about
her
shout
about
her
and
go
into
ecstasies
over
her
wonderful
performance
in
dame
aux
or
fumes
of
but
as
she
can
not
have
these
intoxicating
pleasures
down
here
in
the
country
she
bored
and
gets
spiteful
she
loves
the
stage
she
thinks
that
she
is
advancing
the
cause
of
humanity
and
her
sacred
art
but
i
regard
the
stage
of
as
mere
routine
and
prejudice
when
the
curtain
goes
up
and
the
gifted
beings
the
high
priests
of
the
sacred
art
appear
by
electric
light
in
a
room
with
three
sides
to
it
representing
how
people
eat
drink
love
walk
and
wear
their
jackets
when
they
strive
to
squeeze
out
a
moral
from
the
flat
vulgar
pictures
and
the
flat
vulgar
phrases
a
little
tiny
moral
easy
to
comprehend
and
handy
for
home
consumption
when
in
a
thousand
variations
they
offer
me
always
the
same
thing
over
and
over
and
over
again
then
i
take
to
my
heels
and
run
as
maupassant
ran
from
the
eiffel
tower
which
crushed
his
brain
by
its
overwhelming
vulgarity
we
must
have
new
formulÃ¦
that
what
we
want
and
if
there
are
none
then
better
to
have
nothing
at
all
with
is
her
lover
a
successful
writer
when
he
began
his
literary
career
he
possessed
originality
and
strength
but
gradually
writing
became
a
habit
the
publishers
constantly
demand
new
books
and
he
supplies
them
oh
the
slavery
of
being
an
arrived
artist
forging
new
chains
for
oneself
with
every
best
seller
such
is
the
position
of
he
hates
his
work
as
the
worst
drudgery
exhausted
of
ideas
all
life
and
human
relations
serve
him
only
as
material
for
copy
innocent
of
the
ways
of
the
world
and
saturated
with
the
false
romanticism
of
works
does
not
see
the
man
but
the
celebrated
artist
she
is
carried
away
by
his
fame
and
stirred
by
his
presence
an
infatuation
with
him
quickly
replaces
her
affection
for
to
her
embodies
her
dream
of
a
brilliant
and
interesting
life
how
i
envy
you
if
you
but
knew
it
how
different
are
the
lots
of
different
people
some
can
hardly
drag
on
their
tedious
insignificant
existence
they
are
all
alike
all
miserable
others
like
you
for
instance
you
are
one
in
a
million
are
blessed
with
a
brilliant
interesting
life
all
full
of
meaning
you
are
happy
what
a
delightful
life
yours
is
what
is
there
so
fine
about
it
day
and
night
i
am
obsessed
by
the
same
persistent
thought
i
must
write
i
must
write
i
must
write
no
sooner
have
i
finished
one
story
than
i
am
somehow
compelled
to
write
another
then
a
third
and
after
the
third
a
fourth
i
have
no
rest
for
myself
i
feel
that
i
am
devouring
my
own
life
i
never
satisfied
i
have
the
feeling
for
nature
it
wakes
a
passion
in
me
an
irresistible
desire
to
write
but
i
am
something
more
than
a
landscape
painter
i
a
citizen
as
well
i
love
my
country
i
love
the
people
i
feel
that
if
i
am
a
writer
i
am
bound
to
speak
of
the
people
of
its
suffering
of
its
future
to
speak
of
science
of
the
rights
of
man
etc
and
i
speak
about
it
all
volubly
and
am
attacked
angrily
in
return
by
everyone
i
dart
from
side
to
side
like
a
fox
run
down
by
hounds
i
see
that
life
and
science
fly
farther
and
farther
ahead
of
me
and
i
fall
farther
and
farther
behind
like
the
countryman
running
after
the
train
and
in
the
end
i
feel
that
the
only
thing
i
can
write
of
is
the
landscape
and
in
everything
else
i
am
untrue
to
life
false
to
the
very
marrow
of
my
bones
realizes
that
is
slipping
away
from
him
the
situation
is
aggravated
by
the
constant
friction
with
his
mother
and
his
despair
at
the
lack
of
encouragement
for
his
art
in
a
fit
of
despondency
he
attempts
suicide
but
without
success
his
mother
although
nursing
him
back
to
health
is
infuriated
at
her
foolishness
his
inability
to
adapt
himself
to
conditions
his
impractical
ideas
she
decides
to
leave
accompanied
by
on
the
day
of
their
departure
and
meet
once
more
the
girl
tells
him
of
her
ambition
to
become
an
actress
and
encouraged
by
him
follows
him
to
the
city
two
years
later
still
full
of
her
idle
triumphs
returns
to
her
estate
is
again
with
her
still
haunted
by
the
need
of
copy
has
in
the
interim
matured
considerably
although
he
has
made
himself
heard
as
a
writer
he
nevertheless
feels
that
life
has
no
place
for
such
as
he
that
sincerity
in
art
is
not
wanted
his
mother
is
with
him
but
she
only
serves
to
emphasize
the
flatness
of
his
surroundings
he
loves
her
but
her
ways
jar
him
and
drive
him
into
seclusion
too
has
returned
to
her
native
place
broken
in
body
and
spirit
partly
because
of
the
memory
of
her
past
affection
for
and
mainly
because
she
learns
of
presence
she
is
drawn
to
the
place
where
two
years
before
she
had
dreamed
of
the
beauty
of
an
artistic
career
the
cruel
struggle
for
recognition
the
bitter
disappointment
in
her
relation
with
the
care
of
a
child
and
poor
health
have
combined
to
change
the
romantic
child
into
a
sad
woman
still
loves
her
he
pleads
with
her
to
go
away
with
him
to
begin
a
new
life
but
it
is
too
late
the
lure
of
the
footlights
is
beckoning
to
she
returns
to
the
stage
unable
to
stand
the
loneliness
of
his
life
and
the
mercenary
demands
upon
his
art
kills
himself
to
the
mind
such
an
ending
is
pessimism
defeat
often
however
apparent
defeat
is
in
reality
the
truest
success
for
is
not
success
as
commonly
understood
but
too
frequently
bought
at
the
expense
of
character
and
idealism
the
seagull
is
not
defeat
as
long
as
there
is
still
such
material
in
society
as
the
constantines
men
and
women
who
would
rather
die
than
compromise
with
the
sordidness
of
life
there
is
hope
for
humanity
if
the
constantines
perish
it
is
the
social
fault
our
indifference
to
and
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
real
values
that
alone
advance
the
fuller
and
more
complete
life
of
the
race
the
cherry
orchard
the
cherry
orchard
is
tchekhof
prophetic
song
in
this
play
he
depicts
three
stages
of
social
development
and
their
reflex
in
literature
the
owner
of
the
cherry
orchard
an
estate
celebrated
far
and
wide
for
its
beauty
and
historic
traditions
is
deeply
attached
to
the
family
place
she
loves
it
for
its
romanticism
nightingales
sing
in
the
orchard
accompanying
the
wooing
of
lovers
she
is
devoted
to
it
because
of
the
memory
of
her
ancestors
and
because
of
the
many
tender
ties
which
bind
her
to
the
orchard
the
same
feeling
and
reverence
is
entertained
by
her
brother
they
are
expressed
in
the
to
an
old
family
beloved
and
venerable
cupboard
honor
and
glory
to
your
existence
which
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
has
been
directed
to
the
noble
ideals
of
justice
and
virtue
your
silent
summons
to
profitable
labor
has
never
weakened
in
all
these
hundred
years
you
have
upheld
the
courage
of
succeeding
generations
of
human
kind
you
have
upheld
faith
in
a
better
future
and
cherished
in
us
ideals
of
goodness
and
social
consciousness
but
the
social
consciousness
of
and
of
his
sister
is
of
a
paternal
nature
the
attitude
of
the
aristocracy
toward
its
serfs
it
is
a
paternalism
that
takes
no
account
of
the
freedom
and
happiness
of
the
people
the
romanticism
of
a
dying
class
is
impoverished
the
cherry
orchard
is
heavily
mortgaged
and
as
romance
and
sentiment
can
not
liquidate
debts
the
beautiful
estate
falls
into
the
cruel
hands
of
commercialism
the
merchant
buys
the
place
he
is
in
ecstasy
over
his
newly
acquired
possession
he
the
owner
he
who
had
risen
from
the
serfs
of
the
former
master
of
the
orchard
just
think
of
it
the
cherry
orchard
is
mine
mine
tell
me
that
i
drunk
tell
me
that
i
off
my
head
tell
me
that
all
a
dream
if
only
my
father
and
my
grandfather
could
rise
from
their
graces
and
see
the
whole
affair
how
their
yermolai
their
flogged
and
ignorant
yermolai
who
used
to
run
about
barefooted
in
the
winter
how
this
same
yermolai
had
bought
a
property
that
its
equal
for
beauty
anywhere
in
the
whole
world
i
have
bought
the
property
where
my
father
and
grandfather
were
slaves
where
they
were
even
allowed
into
the
kitchen
a
new
epoch
begins
in
the
cherry
orchard
on
the
ruins
of
romanticism
and
aristocratic
ease
there
rises
commercialism
its
iron
hand
yoking
nature
devastating
her
beauty
and
robbing
her
of
all
radiance
with
the
greed
of
rich
returns
cries
lay
the
ax
to
the
cherry
orchard
come
and
see
the
trees
fall
down
we
fill
the
place
with
villas
materialism
reigns
supreme
it
lords
the
orchard
with
mighty
hand
and
in
the
frenzy
of
its
triumph
believes
itself
in
control
of
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
but
in
the
madness
of
conquest
it
has
discounted
a
stubborn
obstacle
the
spirit
of
idealism
it
is
symbolized
in
the
perpetual
student
and
the
young
daughter
of
the
wonderful
achievements
of
the
materialistic
age
do
not
enthuse
them
they
have
emancipated
themselves
from
the
lopakhin
idol
as
well
as
from
their
aristocratic
traditions
why
is
it
that
i
no
longer
love
the
cherry
orchard
as
i
did
i
used
to
love
it
so
tenderly
i
thought
there
was
no
better
place
on
earth
than
our
garden
all
russia
is
our
garden
the
earth
is
great
and
beautiful
it
is
full
of
wonderful
places
think
anya
your
grandfather
your
and
all
your
ancestors
were
owners
of
living
souls
do
not
human
spirits
look
out
at
you
from
every
tree
in
the
orchard
from
every
leaf
and
every
stem
do
you
not
hear
human
voices
oh
it
is
terrible
your
orchard
frightens
me
when
i
walk
through
it
in
the
evening
or
at
night
the
rugged
bark
on
the
trees
glows
with
a
dim
light
and
the
cherry
trees
seem
to
see
all
that
happened
a
hundred
and
two
hundred
years
ago
in
painful
and
oppressive
dreams
well
well
we
have
fallen
at
least
two
hundred
years
beyond
the
times
we
have
achieved
nothing
at
all
as
yet
we
have
not
made
up
our
minds
how
we
stand
with
the
past
we
only
philosophize
complain
of
boredom
or
drink
vodka
it
is
so
plain
that
before
we
can
live
in
the
present
we
must
first
redeem
the
past
and
have
done
with
it
the
house
we
live
in
has
long
since
ceased
to
be
our
house
i
shall
go
away
if
you
have
the
household
keys
throw
them
in
the
well
and
go
away
be
free
be
free
as
the
wind
i
am
hungry
as
the
winter
i
am
sick
anxious
poor
as
a
beggar
fate
has
tossed
me
hither
and
thither
i
have
been
everywhere
everywhere
but
everywhere
i
have
been
every
minute
day
and
night
my
soul
has
been
full
of
mysterious
anticipations
i
feel
the
approach
of
happiness
anya
i
see
it
coming
it
is
coming
towards
us
nearer
and
nearer
i
can
hear
the
sound
of
its
footsteps
and
if
we
do
not
see
it
if
we
do
not
know
it
what
does
it
matter
others
will
see
it
the
new
generation
on
the
threshold
of
the
new
epoch
hears
the
approaching
footsteps
of
the
future
and
even
if
the
anyas
and
trophimofs
of
will
not
see
it
others
will
it
was
not
given
to
anton
tchekhof
to
see
it
with
his
bodily
eyes
but
his
prophetic
vision
beheld
the
coming
of
the
new
day
and
with
powerful
pen
he
proclaimed
it
that
others
might
see
it
far
from
being
a
pessimist
as
charged
by
unintelligent
critics
his
faith
was
strong
in
the
possibilities
of
liberty
this
is
the
inspiring
message
of
the
cherry
orchard
maxim
gorki
a
night
lodging
we
in
america
are
conversant
with
tramp
literature
a
number
of
writers
of
considerable
note
have
described
what
is
commonly
called
the
underworld
among
them
josiah
flynt
and
jack
london
who
have
ably
interpreted
the
life
and
psychology
of
the
outcast
but
with
all
due
respect
for
their
ability
it
must
be
said
that
after
all
they
wrote
only
as
onlookers
as
observers
they
were
not
tramps
themselves
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
in
the
children
of
the
abyss
jack
london
relates
that
when
he
stood
in
the
breadline
he
had
money
a
room
in
a
good
hotel
and
a
change
of
linen
at
hand
he
was
therefore
not
an
integral
part
of
the
underworld
of
the
homeless
and
hopeless
never
before
has
anyone
given
such
a
true
realistic
picture
of
the
social
depths
as
maxim
gorki
himself
a
denizen
of
the
underworld
from
his
early
childhood
at
the
age
of
eight
he
ran
away
from
his
dismal
home
and
for
many
years
thereafter
he
lived
the
life
of
the
he
tramped
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
russia
he
lived
with
the
peasant
the
factory
worker
and
the
outcast
he
knew
them
intimately
he
understood
their
psychology
for
he
was
not
only
with
them
but
of
them
therefore
gorki
has
been
able
to
present
such
a
vivid
picture
of
the
underworld
a
night
lodging
portrays
a
lodging
house
hideous
and
foul
where
gather
the
social
derelicts
the
thief
the
gambler
the
the
the
prostitute
all
of
them
had
at
one
time
an
ambition
a
goal
but
because
of
their
lack
of
will
and
the
injustice
and
cruelty
of
the
world
they
were
forced
into
the
depths
and
cast
back
whenever
they
attempted
to
rise
they
are
the
superfluous
ones
dehumanized
and
brutalized
in
this
poisonous
air
where
everything
withers
and
dies
we
nevertheless
find
character
a
young
girl
still
retains
her
wholesome
instincts
she
had
never
known
love
or
sympathy
had
gone
hungry
all
her
days
and
had
tasted
nothing
but
abuse
from
her
brutal
sister
on
whom
she
was
dependent
the
young
thief
a
lodger
in
the
house
strikes
a
responsive
chord
in
her
the
moment
he
makes
her
feel
that
he
cares
for
her
and
that
she
might
be
of
spiritual
and
moral
help
to
him
like
is
a
product
of
his
social
environment
from
childhood
i
have
been
only
a
thief
always
i
was
called
vaska
the
pickpocket
vaska
the
son
of
a
thief
see
it
was
of
no
consequence
to
me
as
long
as
they
would
have
it
so
so
they
would
have
it
i
was
a
thief
perhaps
only
out
of
spite
because
nobody
came
along
to
call
me
anything
thief
you
call
me
something
else
natasha
it
is
no
easy
life
that
i
lead
friendless
pursued
like
a
wolf
i
sink
like
a
man
in
a
swamp
whatever
i
touch
is
slimy
and
rotten
nothing
is
firm
but
you
are
like
a
young
you
are
prickly
but
you
give
support
there
is
another
humane
figure
illuminating
the
dark
picture
in
a
night
lodging
he
is
the
type
of
an
old
pilgrim
a
man
whom
the
experiences
of
life
have
taught
wisdom
he
has
tramped
through
russia
and
siberia
and
consorted
with
all
sorts
of
people
but
disappointment
and
grief
have
not
robbed
him
of
his
faith
in
beauty
in
idealism
he
believes
that
every
man
however
low
degraded
or
demoralized
can
yet
be
reached
if
we
but
know
how
to
touch
his
soul
inspires
courage
and
hope
in
everyone
he
meets
urging
each
to
begin
life
anew
to
the
former
actor
now
steeped
in
drink
he
says
the
drunkard
i
have
heard
can
now
be
cured
without
charge
they
realize
now
you
see
that
the
drunkard
is
also
a
man
you
must
begin
to
make
ready
begin
a
new
life
tries
also
to
imbue
and
with
new
faith
they
marvel
at
his
goodness
in
simplicity
of
heart
gives
his
philosophy
of
life
i
am
good
you
say
but
you
see
there
must
be
some
one
to
be
good
we
must
have
pity
on
mankind
have
pity
while
there
is
still
time
believe
me
it
is
very
good
i
was
once
for
example
employed
as
a
watchman
at
a
country
place
which
belonged
to
an
engineer
not
far
from
the
city
of
tomsk
in
siberia
the
house
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
an
location
and
it
was
winter
and
i
was
all
alone
in
the
country
house
it
was
beautiful
there
magnificent
and
once
i
heard
them
scrambling
up
thieves
yes
they
crept
higher
and
i
took
my
rifle
and
went
outside
i
looked
up
two
men
as
they
were
opening
a
window
and
so
busy
that
they
did
not
see
anything
of
me
at
all
i
cried
to
them
heh
there
get
out
of
that
and
would
you
think
it
they
fell
on
me
with
a
hand
ax
i
warned
them
halt
i
cried
or
else
i
fire
then
i
aimed
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
they
fell
on
their
knees
saying
pardon
us
i
was
pretty
hot
on
account
of
the
hand
ax
you
remember
you
devils
i
cried
i
told
you
to
clear
out
and
you
did
and
now
i
said
one
of
you
go
into
the
brash
and
get
a
switch
it
was
done
and
now
i
commanded
one
of
you
stretch
out
on
the
ground
and
the
other
thrash
him
and
so
they
whipped
each
other
at
my
command
and
when
they
had
each
had
a
sound
beating
they
said
to
me
grandfather
said
they
for
the
sake
of
christ
give
us
a
piece
of
bread
we
have
a
bite
in
our
bodies
they
were
the
thieves
who
had
fallen
upon
me
with
the
hand
ax
yes
they
were
a
pair
of
splendid
fellows
i
said
to
them
if
you
had
asked
for
bread
then
they
answered
we
had
gotten
past
that
we
had
asked
and
asked
and
nobody
would
give
us
anything
endurance
was
worn
out
and
so
they
remained
with
me
the
whole
winter
one
of
them
stephen
by
name
liked
to
take
the
rifle
and
go
into
the
woods
and
the
other
jakoff
was
constantly
ill
always
coughing
the
three
of
us
watched
the
place
and
when
spring
came
they
said
farewell
grandfather
and
went
away
to
russia
were
they
convicts
escaping
they
were
fugitives
they
had
left
their
colony
a
pair
of
splendid
fellows
if
i
had
not
had
pity
on
them
who
knows
what
would
have
happened
they
might
have
killed
me
then
they
would
be
taken
to
court
again
put
in
prison
sent
back
to
siberia
why
all
that
you
learn
nothing
good
in
prison
nor
in
siberia
but
a
man
what
can
he
not
learn
man
may
teach
his
fellowman
something
good
very
simply
impressed
and
strengthened
by
wonderful
faith
and
vision
the
unfortunates
make
an
attempt
to
rise
from
the
social
swamp
but
he
has
come
too
late
into
their
lives
they
have
been
robbed
of
energy
and
will
and
conditions
always
conspire
to
thrust
them
back
into
the
depths
when
and
are
about
to
start
out
on
the
road
to
a
new
life
fate
overtakes
them
the
girl
during
a
scene
with
her
heartless
sister
is
terribly
scalded
by
the
latter
and
rushing
to
the
defense
of
his
sweetheart
encounters
her
brutal
whom
he
accidentally
kills
thus
these
superfluous
ones
go
down
in
the
struggle
not
because
of
their
vicious
or
degrading
tendencies
on
the
contrary
it
is
their
better
instincts
that
cause
them
to
be
swept
back
into
the
abyss
but
though
they
perish
the
inspiration
of
is
not
entirely
lost
it
is
epitomized
in
the
words
of
one
of
the
victims
the
old
man
he
lived
from
within
he
saw
everything
with
his
own
eyes
i
asked
him
once
grandfather
why
do
men
really
live
man
lives
ever
to
give
birth
to
strength
there
live
for
example
the
carpenters
noisy
miserable
people
and
suddenly
in
their
midst
is
a
carpenter
born
such
a
carpenter
as
the
world
has
never
seen
he
is
above
all
no
other
carpenter
can
be
compared
to
him
he
gives
a
new
face
to
the
whole
trade
his
own
face
so
to
speak
and
with
that
simple
impulse
it
has
advanced
twenty
years
and
so
the
others
live
the
locksmiths
and
the
shoemakers
and
all
the
rest
of
the
working
people
and
the
same
is
true
of
other
classes
all
to
give
birth
to
strength
everyone
thinks
that
he
for
himself
takes
up
room
in
the
world
but
it
turns
out
that
he
is
here
for
another
benefit
for
someone
better
a
hundred
years
or
perhaps
longer
if
we
live
so
long
for
the
sake
of
genius
all
my
children
all
live
only
to
give
birth
to
strength
for
that
reason
we
must
respect
everybody
we
can
not
know
who
he
is
for
what
purpose
born
or
what
he
may
yet
fulfill
perhaps
he
has
been
born
for
our
good
fortune
or
great
benefit
no
stronger
indictment
than
a
night
lodging
is
to
be
found
in
contemporary
literature
of
our
perverse
civilization
that
condemns
thousands
often
the
very
best
men
and
women
to
the
fate
of
the
vaskas
and
anyas
doomed
as
superfluous
and
unnecessary
in
society
and
yet
they
are
necessary
aye
they
are
vital
could
we
but
see
beneath
the
veil
of
cold
indifference
and
stupidity
to
discover
the
deep
humanity
the
latent
possibilities
in
these
lowliest
of
the
low
if
within
our
social
conditions
they
are
useless
material
often
vicious
and
detrimental
to
the
general
good
it
is
because
they
have
been
denied
opportunity
and
forced
into
conditions
that
kill
their
faith
in
themselves
and
all
that
is
best
in
their
natures
the
depravity
and
crimes
of
these
derelicts
are
fundamentally
the
depravity
and
criminal
attitude
of
society
itself
that
first
creates
the
underworld
and
having
created
it
wastes
much
energy
and
effort
in
suppressing
and
destroying
the
menacing
phantom
of
its
own
making
forgetful
of
the
elemental
brotherhood
of
man
blind
to
the
value
of
the
individual
and
ignorant
of
the
beautiful
possibilities
inherent
in
even
the
most
despised
children
of
the
depths
leonid
andreyev
leonid
andreyev
is
the
youngest
and
at
the
present
time
the
most
powerful
dramatist
of
russia
like
tchekhof
and
gorki
he
is
very
versatile
his
sketches
and
stories
possess
as
fine
a
literary
quality
and
stirring
social
appeal
as
his
plays
no
one
who
has
read
his
terrible
picture
of
war
the
red
laugh
or
his
unsurpassed
arraignment
of
capital
punishment
the
seven
who
were
hanged
can
erase
from
memory
the
effect
of
leonid
andreyev
forceful
pen
the
drama
deals
with
most
powerful
king
on
earth
in
the
presence
of
and
he
pleads
with
to
ring
the
alarm
to
call
the
people
to
rebellion
because
the
earth
is
replete
with
suffering
cities
shops
mines
factories
and
fields
resound
with
the
moans
and
groans
of
the
people
their
agony
is
unbearable
strike
the
bell
old
man
rend
to
ears
its
copper
mouth
let
no
one
slumber
but
has
no
faith
in
he
knows
that
had
deceived
the
people
on
many
occasions
you
will
deceive
again
you
have
many
a
time
deluded
your
children
and
me
yet
is
weary
with
waiting
he
consents
to
strike
the
bell
calls
upon
the
workingmen
to
rebel
the
scene
is
in
a
machine
shop
the
place
is
filled
with
deafening
noises
as
of
groans
every
machine
every
tool
every
screw
holds
its
human
forms
fettered
to
it
and
all
keep
pace
with
the
maddening
speed
of
their
tormentors
and
through
the
thunder
and
clatter
of
iron
there
rises
the
terrible
plaint
of
the
toilers
we
are
starving
we
are
crushed
by
machines
their
weight
smothers
us
the
iron
crushes
the

oppresses
oh
what
a
furious
weight
as
a
mountain
upon
me
the
whole

is
upon
me
the
iron
hammer
flattens
me
it
crushes
the
blood
out
of
my
veins
it
fractures
my
bones
it
makes
me
flat
as
sheet
iron
through
the
rollers
my
body
is
pressed
and
drawn
thin
as
wire
where
is
my

where

soul
the

is
twirling

screeching
of
the

all
the
dreams
that
i
see
all
the
sounds
and

that
i
hear
is
the

we
are
crushed
by
the

we
ourselves
are
parts
of

we
forge
our

the
crushed
call
upon
to
help
them
to
save
them
from
the
horror
of
their
life
is
he
not
the
most
powerful
king
on
earth
comes
and
exhorts
them
to
rebel
all
follow
his
call
except
three
one
of
these
is
huge
of
body
of
herculean
built
large
of
muscle
but
with
small
flat
head
upon
his
massive
shoulders
the
second
workingman
is
young
but
with
the
mark
of
death
already
upon
his
brow
he
is
constantly
coughing
and
the
hectic
flush
on
his
cheeks
betrays
the
wasting
disease
of
his
class
the
third
workingman
is
a
old
man
everything
about
him
even
his
voice
is
deathlike
colorless
as
if
in
his
person
a
thousand
lives
had
been
robbed
of
their
bloom
i
am
as
old
as
the
earth
i
have
performed
all
the
twelve
labors
cleansed
stables
cut
off
the
hydra
heads
dug
and
vexed
the
earth
built
cities
and
have
so
altered
its
face
that
the
creator
himself
would
not
readily
recognize
her
but
i
ca
say
why
i
did
all
this
whose
will
did
i
shape
to
what
end
did
i
aspire
my
head
is
dull
i
am
dead
tired
my
strength
oppresses
me
explain
it
to
me
o
king
or
i
clutch
this
hammer
and
crack
the
earth
as
a
hollow
nut
patience
my
son
save
your
powers
for
the
last
great
revolt
then
you
know
all
i
shall
wait
he
can
not
comprehend
it
o
king
he
thinks
that
we
must
crack
the
earth
it
is
a
gross
falsehood
o
king
the
earth
is
fair
as
the
garden
of
god
we
must
guard
and
caress
her
as
a
little
girl
many
that
stand
there
in
the
darkness
say
there
is
no
sky
no
sun
as
if
eternal
night
is
upon
the
earth
just
think
eternal
night
why
coughing
blood
do
you
smile
and
gaze
to
heaven
because
flowers
will
blossom
on
my
blood
and
i
see
them
now
on
the
breast
of
a
beautiful
rich
lady
i
saw
a
red
rose
she
did
know
it
was
my
blood
you
are
a
poet
my
son
i
suppose
you
write
verses
as
they
do
king
o
king
sneer
not
at
me
in
darkness
i
learned
to
worship
fire
dying
i
understood
that
life
is
enchanting
oh
how
enchanting
king
it
shall
become
a
great
garden
and
there
shall
walk
in
peace
unmolested
men
and
animals
dare
not
ruffle
the
animals
wrong
not
any
man
let
them
play
embrace
caress
one
another
let
them
but
where
is
the
path
where
is
the
path
explain
revolt
through
violence
to
freedom
through
blood
to
love
and
kisses
there
is
no
other
way
you
lie
then
you
have
killed
my
father
and
grandfather
and
and
thou
kill
us
where
do
you
lead
us
unarmed
do
you
see
how
ignorant
we
are
how
blind
and
impotent
you
are
a
traitor
only
here
you
are
a
king
but
there
you
lackey
upon
their
tables
only
here
you
wear
a
crown
but
there
you
walk
about
with
a
napkin
will
not
listen
to
their
protest
he
gives
them
the
alternative
of
rebellion
or
starvation
for
themselves
and
their
children
they
decide
to
rebel
for
is
the
most
powerful
king
on
earth
the
subjects
of
the
people
of
the
underworld
gather
to
devise
ways
and
means
of
rebellion
a
gruesome
assembly
this
held
in
the
cellar
above
is
the
palace
ringing
with
music
and
laughter
the
fine
ladies
in
gorgeous
splendor
bedecked
with
flowers
and
costly
jewels
the
tables
laden
with
rich
food
and
delicious
wines
everything
is
most
exquisite
there
joyous
and
happy
and
underneath
in
the
cellar
the
underworld
is
gathered
all
the
dregs
of
society
the
robber
and
the
murderer
the
thief
and
the
prostitute
the
gambler
and
the
drunkard
they
have
come
to
consult
with
each
other
how
poverty
is
to
rebel
how
to
throw
off
the
yoke
and
what
to
do
with
the
rich
various
suggestions
are
made
one
advises
poisoning
the
supply
of
water
but
this
is
condemned
on
the
ground
that
the
people
also
have
to
drink
from
the
same
source
another
suggests
that
all
books
should
be
burned
for
they
teach
the
rich
how
to
oppress
but
the
motion
fails
what
is
the
use
of
burning
the
books
the
wealthy
have
money
they
will
buy
writers
poets
and
scientists
to
make
new
books
a
third
proposes
that
the
children
of
the
rich
be
killed
from
the
darkest
most
dismal
corner
of
the
cellar
comes
the
protest
of
an
old
woman
oh
not
the
children
do
touch
the
children
i
have
buried
many
of
them
myself
i
know
the
pain
of
the
mother
besides
the
children
are
not
to
blame
for
the
crimes
of
their
parents
do
touch
the
children
the
child
is
pure
and
sacred
do
hurt
the
child
a
little
girl
rises
a
child
of
twelve
with
the
face
of
the
aged
she
announces
that
for
the
last
four
years
she
has
given
her
body
for
money
she
had
been
sold
by
her
mother
because
they
needed
bread
for
the
smaller
children
during
the
four
years
of
her
terrible
life
she
has
consorted
with
all
kinds
of
men
influential
men
rich
men
pious
men
they
infected
her
therefore
she
proposes
that
the
rich
should
be
infected
the
underworld
plans
and
plots
and
the
gruesome
meeting
is
closed
with
a
frenzied
dance
between
and
to
the
music
of
the
dance
above
is
at
the
trial
of
the
he
is
the
most
powerful
king
on
earth
he
is
at
home
everywhere
but
nowhere
more
so
than
at
the
trial
of
the
on
high
chairs
sit
the
judges
in
all
their
bloated
importance
the
courtroom
is
filled
with
curiosity
seekers
idle
ladies
dressed
as
if
for
a
ball
college
professors
and
students
looking
for
object
lessons
in
criminal
depravity
rich
young
girls
are
there
to
satisfy
a
perverted
craving
for
excitement
the
first
starveling
is
brought
in
muzzled
what
is
your
offense
starveling
i
stole
a
loaf
but
it
was
wrested
from
me
i
had
only
time
to
bite
a
small
piece
of
it
forgive
me
i
will
never
again
he
is
condemned
in
the
name
of
the
and
the
most
powerful
king
on
earth
another
starveling
is
brought
before
the
bar
of
justice
it
is
a
woman
young
and
beautiful
but
pale
and
sad
she
is
charged
with
killing
her
child
one
night
my
baby
and
i
crossed
the
long
bridge
over
the
river
and
since
i
had
long
before
decided
so
then
approaching
the
middle
where
the
river
is
deep
and
swift
i
said
look
baby
dear
how
the
water
is
below
she
said
i
ca
reach
mamma
the
railing
is
so
high
i
said
come
let
me
lift
you
baby
dear
and
when
she
was
gazing
down
into
the
black
deep
i
threw
her
over
that
all
the
and
condemn
the
woman
to
blackest
hell
there
to
be
tormented
and
burned
in
everlasting
slackless
fires
the
heavy
responsibility
of
meting
out
justice
has
fatigued
the
judges
the
excitement
of
the
trial
has
sharpened
the
appetite
of
the
spectators
at
home
with
all
people
proposes
that
the
court
adjourn
for
luncheon
the
scene
in
the
restaurant
represents
hunger
devouring
like
a
wild
beast
the
produce
of
toil
ravenous
famished
the
victim
of
his
own
gluttonous
greed
the
monster
fed
his
hunger
and
thirst
appeased
he
now
returns
to
sit
in
judgment
over
the
the
judges
are
more
bloated
than
before
the
ladies
more
eager
to
bask
in
the
misery
of
their
fellows
the
college
professors
and
students
mentally
heavy
with
food
are
still
anxious
to
add
data
to
the
study
of
human
criminality
a
lean
boy
is
brought
in
muzzled
he
is
followed
by
a
ragged
woman
have
mercy
he
stole
an
apple
for
me
your
honor
i
was
sick
thought
he
let
me
bring
her
a
little
apple
pity
him
tell
them
that
you
wo
any
more
well
speak
i
wo
any
more
i
already
punished
him
myself
pity
his
youth
cut
not
at
the
root
his
bright
little
days
indeed
pity
one
and
then
the
next
cut
the
evil
at
its
roots
one
needs
courage
to
be
ruthless
it
is
better
for
them
now
he
is
only
a
boy
but
when
he
grows
up
starveling
you
are
condemned
a
starveling
heavily
muzzled
is
dragged
in
he
is
big
and
strong
he
protests
to
the
court
he
has
always
been
a
faithful
slave
but
announces
that
the
man
is
dangerous
because
the
faithful
slave
being
strong
and
honest
is
obnoxious
to
people
of
refined
culture
and
less
brawny
the
slave
is
faithful
warns
the
judges
but
who
can
trust
the
then
in
his
strength
and
integrity
we
will
encounter
a
violent
and
dangerous
enemy
in
the
name
of
justice
the
faithful
slave
is
condemned
finally
the
last
starveling
appears
he
looks
half
human
half
beast
who
are
you
starveling
answer
do
you
understand
human
speech
we
are
the
peasants
what
your
offense
we
killed
the
devil
it
was
a
man
whom
you
burnt
no
it
was
the
devil
the
priest
told
us
so
and
then
we
burnt
him
the
peasant
is
condemned
the
session
of
the
court
closes
with
a
brief
speech
by
you
witnessed
a
highly
instructive
spectacle
divine
eternal
justice
has
found
in
us
as
judges
and
your
retainers
its
brilliant
reflection
on
earth
subject
only
to
the
laws
of
immortal
equity
unknown
to
culpable
compassion
indifferent
to
cursing
and
entreating
prayers
obeying
the
voice
of
our
conscience
alone
we
illumed
this
earth
with
the
light
of
human
wisdom
and
sublime
sacred
truth
not
for
a
single
moment
forgetting
that
justice
is
the
foundation
of
life
we
have
crucified
the
christ
in
days
gone
by
and
since
to
this
very
day
we
cease
not
to
grace
golgotha
with
new
crosses
but
certainly
only
ruffians
only
ruffians
are
hanged
we
showed
no
mercy
to
god
himself
in
the
name
of
the
laws
of
immortal
justice
would
we
be
now
disconcerted
by
the
howling
of
this
impotent
starving
rabble
by
their
cursing
and
raging
let
them
curse
life
herself
blesses
us
the
great
sacred
truth
will
screen
us
with
her
veil
and
the
very
decree
of
history
will
not
be
more
just
than
our
own
what
have
they
gained
by
cursing
what
they
are
there
we
here
they
are
in
dungeons
in
galleys
on
crosses
but
we
will
go
to
the
theater
they
perish
but
we
will
devour
them
devour
devour
the
court
has
fulfilled
its
mission
is
the
most
powerful
king
on
earth
the
starvelings
break
out
in
revolt
the
bells
peal
with
deafening
thunder
all
is
confusion
and
chaos
the
city
is
immersed
in
the
blackness
of
despair
and
all
is
dark
now
and
then
gusts
of
fire
sweep
the
sky
illuminating
the
scene
of
battle
the
air
is
filled
with
cries
and
groans
there
is
the
thud
of
falling
bodies
and
still
the
fight
goes
on
in
a
secluded
part
of
the
town
stands
the
castle
in
its
most
magnificent
ballroom
the
rich
and
their
lackeys
scientists
teachers
and
artists
are
gathered
they
tremble
with
fear
at
the
ominous
sounds
outside
to
silence
the
loud
beat
of
their
terror
they
command
the
musicians
to
strike
up
the
liveliest
tunes
and
the
guests
whirl
about
in
a
mad
dance
from
time
to
time
the
door
is
forced
open
and
someone
drops
exhausted
to
the
floor
an
artist
rushes
in
crying
out
that
the
art
gallery
is
in
flames
murillo
is
burning
velasquez
is
burning
giorgione
is
burning
he
is
not
in
the
least
concerned
with
living
values
he
dwells
in
the
past
and
he
wildly
bewails
the
dead
weight
of
the
past
one
after
another
men
rush
in
to
report
the
burning
of
libraries
the
breaking
of
statues
and
the
destruction
of
monuments
no
one
among
the
wealthy
mob
regrets
the
slaughter
of
human
life
the
mighty
fall
from
their
thrones
the
starving
infuriated
and
vengeful
are
marching
on
the
masters
they
must
not
see
the
craven
fear
of
the
huddled
figures
in
the
mansions
the
lights
are
turned
off
but
darkness
is
even
more
terrible
to
the
frightened
palace
mob
in
the
madness
of
terror
they
begin
to
accuse
and
denounce
each
other
they
feel
as
helpless
as
children
before
the
approaching
avalanche
of
vengeance
at
this
critical
moment
a
man
appears
he
is
small
dirty
and
unwashed
he
smells
of
cheap
whisky
and
bad
tobacco
he
blows
his
nose
with
a
red
handkerchief
and
his
manners
are
disgusting
he
is
the
engineer
he
looks
calmly
about
him
presses
a
button
and
the
place
is
flooded
with
light
he
brings
the
comforting
news
that
the
revolt
is
crushed
on
sunny
hill
we
planted
a
line
of
immense
machine
guns
of
enormous
power
a
few
projectiles
of
a
specially
destructive
power
a
public
square
filled
with
people
enough
one
or
two
such
shells
and
should
the
revolt
still
continue
we
shower
the
city
the
revolt
is
over
all
is
quiet
the
peace
of
death
the
ground
is
strewn
with
bodies
the
streets
are
soaked
with
blood
fine
ladies
flit
about
they
lift
their
children
and
bid
them
kiss
the
mouth
of
the
cannon
for
the
cannon
have
saved
the
rich
from
destruction
prayers
and
hymns
are
offered
up
to
the
cannon
for
they
have
saved
the
masters
and
punished
the
starvelings
and
all
is
quiet
with
the
stillness
of
the
graveyard
where
sleep
the
dead
with
hollow
cheeks
and
sunken
eyes
makes
a
desperate
last
appeal
to
his
children
oh
my
son
my
son
you
clamored
so
loud
why
are
you
mute
oh
my
daughter
my
daughter
you
hated
so
profoundly
so
intensely
you
most
miserable
on
earth
arise
arise
from
the
dust
rend
the
shadowy
bonds
of
death
arise
i
conjure
you
in
the
name
of
life
you
silent
for
a
brief
moment
all
remains
silent
and
immovable
suddenly
a
sound
is
heard
distant
at
first
then
nearer
and
nearer
till
a
roar
breaks
forth
like
thunder
we
shall
yet
come
we
shall
yet
come
woe
unto
the
victorious
the
victors
pale
at
the
ghostly
cry
seized
with
terror
they
run
wildly
howling
the
dead
arise
the
dead
arise
we
shall
yet
come
cry
the
dead
for
they
who
died
for
an
ideal
never
die
in
vain
they
must
come
back
they
shall
come
back
and
then
woe
be
to
the
victorious
is
indeed
the
most
terrible
king
on
earth
but
only
for
those
who
are
driven
by
blind
forces
alone
but
they
who
can
turn
on
the
light
know
the
power
of
the
things
they
have
created
they
will
come
and
take
possession
no
longer

wretched
scum
but
the
masters

the
