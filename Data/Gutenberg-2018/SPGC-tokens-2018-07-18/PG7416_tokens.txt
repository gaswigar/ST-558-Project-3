the
thirteen
by
honore
de
balzac
translated
by
katharine
prescott
wormeley
and
ellen
marriage
dedication
to
hector
berlioz
introduction
the
des
consists
or
rather
is
built
up
of
three
stories
or
the
duchesse
de
or
a
la
and
fille
aux
yeux
d
to
tell
the
truth
there
is
more
power
than
taste
throughout
the
des
and
perhaps
not
very
much
less
unreality
than
power
balzac
is
very
much
better
than
eugene
sue
though
eugene
sue
also
is
better
than
it
is
the
fashion
to
think
him
just
now
but
he
is
here
to
a
certain
extent
competing
with
sue
on
the
latter
s
own
ground
the
notion
of
the
devorants
of
a
secret
society
of
men
devoted
to
each
other
s
interests
entirely
free
from
any
moral
or
legal
scruple
possessed
of
considerable
means
in
wealth
ability
and
position
all
working
together
by
fair
means
or
foul
for
good
ends
or
bad
is
no
doubt
rather
seducing
to
the
imagination
at
all
times
and
it
so
happened
that
it
was
particularly
seducing
to
the
imagination
of
that
time
and
its
example
has
been
powerful
since
it
gave
us
stevenson
s
arabian
only
as
it
were
the
other
day
but
there
is
something
a
little
schoolboyish
in
it
and
i
do
not
know
that
balzac
has
succeeded
entirely
in
eliminating
this
something
the
pathos
of
the
death
under
persecution
of
the
innocent
clemence
does
not
entirely
make
up
for
the
unreasonableness
of
the
whole
situation
nobody
can
say
that
the
abominable
misconduct
of
maulincour
who
is
a
hopeless
cad
is
too
much
punished
though
an
englishman
may
think
that
johnson
s
receipt
of
three
or
four
footmen
with
cudgels
applied
repeatedly
and
unsparingly
would
have
been
better
than
elaborately
prepared
accidents
and
duels
which
were
too
honorable
for
a
peeping
tom
of
this
kind
and
poisonings
which
reduced
the
avengers
to
the
level
of
their
victim
but
the
imbroglio
is
of
itself
stupid
these
fathers
who
can
not
be
made
known
to
husbands
are
mere
stage
properties
and
should
never
be
fetched
out
of
the
theatrical
by
literature
duchesse
de
is
i
think
a
better
story
with
more
romantic
attraction
free
from
the
objections
just
made
to
and
furnished
with
a
powerful
if
slightly
theatrical
catastrophe
it
is
as
good
as
anything
that
its
author
has
done
of
the
kind
subject
to
those
general
considerations
of
probability
and
otherwise
which
have
been
already
hinted
at
for
those
who
are
not
troubled
by
any
such
critical
reflections
both
no
doubt
will
be
highly
satisfactory
the
third
of
the
series
fille
aux
yeux
d
in
some
respects
one
of
balzac
s
most
brilliant
effects
has
been
looked
at
askance
by
many
of
his
english
readers
at
one
time
he
had
the
audacity
to
think
of
calling
it
femme
aux
yeux
to
those
who
consider
the
story
morbid
or
one
may
say
one
word
of
justification
hardly
of
apology
may
be
offered
it
was
in
the
scheme
of
the
to
survey
social
life
in
its
entirety
by
a
minute
analysis
of
its
most
diverse
constituents
it
included
all
the
pursuits
and
passions
was
large
and
patient
and
unafraid
and
the
patience
the
curiosity
of
the
artist
which
made
cesar
birotteau
and
his
bankrupt
ledgers
matters
of
high
import
to
us
which
did
not
shrink
from
creating
a
vautrin
and
a
lucien
de
rubempre
would
have
been
incomplete
had
it
stopped
short
of
a
marquise
de
of
a
paquita
valdes
and
in
the
great
mass
of
the
with
its
largeness
and
reality
of
life
as
in
life
itself
the
figure
of
paquita
justifies
its
presence
considering
the
des
as
a
whole
it
is
of
engrossing
interest
and
i
must
confess
i
should
not
think
much
of
any
boy
who
beginning
balzac
with
this
series
failed
to
go
rather
mad
over
it
i
know
there
was
a
time
when
i
used
to
like
it
best
of
all
and
thought
not
merely
but
pere
though
not
the
de
dull
in
comparison
some
attention
however
must
be
paid
to
two
remarkable
characters
on
whom
it
is
quite
clear
that
balzac
expended
a
great
deal
of
pains
and
one
of
whom
he
seems
to
have
caressed
as
the
french
say
with
a
curious
admixture
of
dislike
and
admiration
the
first
bourignard
or
ferragus
is
of
course
another
though
a
somewhat
minor
example
collin
or
vautrin
being
the
chief
of
that
strange
tendency
to
take
intense
interest
in
criminals
which
seems
to
be
a
pretty
constant
eccentricity
of
many
human
minds
and
which
laid
an
extraordinary
grasp
on
the
great
french
writers
of
balzac
s
time
i
must
confess
though
it
may
sink
me
very
low
in
some
eyes
that
i
have
never
been
able
to
fully
appreciate
the
attractions
of
crime
and
criminals
fictitious
or
real
certain
pleasant
and
profitable
things
no
doubt
retain
their
pleasure
and
their
profit
to
some
extent
when
they
are
done
in
the
manner
which
is
technically
called
criminal
but
they
seem
to
me
to
acquire
no
additional
interest
by
being
so
as
the
criminal
of
fact
is
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
an
exceedingly
commonplace
and
dull
person
the
criminal
of
fiction
seems
to
me
only
or
usually
to
escape
these
curses
by
being
absolutely
improbable
and
unreal
but
i
know
this
is
a
terrible
heresy
henri
de
marsay
is
a
much
more
ambitious
and
a
much
more
interesting
figure
in
him
are
combined
the
attractions
of
criminality
beauty
brains
success
and
last
of
all
dandyism
it
is
a
and
delightful
fact
that
the
most
anglophobe
frenchmen
and
balzac
might
fairly
be
classed
among
them
have
always
regarded
the
english
dandy
with
admiration
indeed
our
novelist
it
will
be
seen
found
it
necessary
to
give
marsay
english
blood
but
there
is
a
tradition
that
this
young
don
juan
not
such
a
good
fellow
as
byron
s
nor
such
a
as
moliere
s
was
partly
intended
to
represent
charles
de
remusat
who
is
best
known
to
this
generation
by
very
sober
and
serious
philosophical
works
and
by
his
part
in
his
mother
s
correspondence
i
do
not
know
that
there
ever
were
any
imputation
on
de
remusat
s
morals
but
in
memoirs
of
the
time
he
is
i
think
accused
of
a
certain
selfishness
and
and
he
certainly
made
his
way
partly
by
journalism
partly
by
society
to
power
very
much
as
marsay
did
but
marsay
would
certainly
not
have
written
and
the
rest
or
have
returned
to
ministerial
rank
in
our
own
time
marsay
in
fact
more
fortunate
than
rubempre
and
of
a
higher
stamp
and
flight
than
rastignac
makes
with
them
balzac
s
trinity
of
sketches
of
the
kind
of
personage
whose
part
in
his
day
and
since
every
young
frenchman
has
aspired
to
play
and
some
have
played
it
can
not
be
said
that
a
moral
man
is
marsay
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
has
the
element
of
which
redeems
rastignac
but
he
bears
a
blame
and
a
burden
for
which
we
britons
are
responsible
in
part
the
byronic
ideal
of
the
guilty
hero
coming
to
cross
and
blacken
the
old
french
model
of
unscrupulous
good
humor
it
is
not
a
very
pretty
mixture
or
a
very
worthy
ideal
but
i
am
not
so
sure
that
it
is
not
still
a
pretty
common
one
the
association
of
the
three
stories
forming
the
des
is
in
book
form
original
inasmuch
as
they
filled
three
out
of
the
four
volumes
of
des
published
in
and
themselves
forming
part
of
the
first
collection
of
de
la
vie
but
had
appeared
in
parts
with
titles
to
each
in
the
de
for
march
and
april
and
part
of
duchesse
de
in
the
de
la
jeune
almost
contemporaneously
there
are
divisions
in
this
also
and
also
appeared
without
fille
aux
yeux
d
in
published
in
one
volume
by
charpentier
before
their
absorption
at
the
usual
time
in
the
george
saintsbury
author
s
preface
in
the
paris
of
the
empire
there
were
found
thirteen
men
equally
impressed
with
the
same
idea
equally
endowed
with
energy
enough
to
keep
them
true
to
it
while
among
themselves
they
were
loyal
enough
to
keep
faith
even
when
their
interests
seemed
to
clash
they
were
strong
enough
to
set
themselves
above
all
laws
bold
enough
to
shrink
from
no
enterprise
and
lucky
enough
to
succeed
in
nearly
everything
that
they
undertook
so
profoundly
politic
were
they
that
they
could
dissemble
the
tie
which
bound
them
together
they
ran
the
greatest
risks
and
kept
their
failures
to
themselves
fear
never
entered
into
their
calculations
not
one
of
them
had
trembled
before
princes
before
the
executioner
s
axe
before
innocence
they
had
taken
each
other
as
they
were
regardless
of
social
prejudices
criminals
they
doubtless
were
yet
none
the
less
were
they
all
remarkable
for
some
one
of
the
virtues
which
go
to
the
making
of
great
men
and
their
numbers
were
filled
up
only
from
among
picked
recruits
finally
that
nothing
should
be
lacking
to
complete
the
dark
mysterious
romance
of
their
history
nobody
to
this
day
knows
who
they
were
the
thirteen
once
realized
all
the
wildest
ideas
conjured
up
by
tales
of
the
occult
powers
of
a
manfred
a
faust
or
a
melmoth
and
the
band
is
broken
up
or
at
any
rate
dispersed
its
members
have
quietly
returned
beneath
the
yoke
of
the
civil
code
much
as
morgan
the
achilles
of
piracy
gave
up
buccaneering
to
be
a
peaceable
planter
and
untroubled
by
qualms
of
conscience
sat
himself
down
by
the
fireside
to
dispose
of
booty
acquired
by
the
red
light
of
blazing
towns
after
napoleon
s
death
the
band
was
dissolved
by
a
chance
event
which
the
author
is
bound
for
the
present
to
pass
over
in
silence
and
its
mysterious
existence
as
curious
it
may
be
as
the
darkest
novel
by
radcliffe
came
to
an
end
it
was
only
lately
that
the
present
writer
detecting
as
he
fancied
a
faint
desire
for
celebrity
in
one
of
the
anonymous
heroes
to
whom
the
whole
band
once
owed
an
occult
allegiance
received
the
somewhat
singular
permission
to
make
public
certain
of
the
adventures
which
befell
that
band
provided
that
while
telling
the
story
in
his
own
fashion
he
observed
certain
limits
the
aforesaid
leader
was
still
an
apparently
young
man
with
fair
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
a
soft
thin
voice
which
might
seem
to
indicate
a
feminine
temperament
his
face
was
pale
his
ways
mysterious
he
chatted
pleasantly
and
told
me
that
he
was
only
just
turned
of
forty
he
might
have
belonged
to
any
one
of
the
upper
classes
the
name
which
he
gave
was
probably
assumed
and
no
one
answering
to
his
description
was
known
in
society
who
is
he
do
you
ask
no
one
knows
perhaps
when
he
made
his
extraordinary
disclosures
to
the
present
writer
he
wished
to
see
them
in
some
sort
reproduced
to
enjoy
the
effect
of
the
sensation
on
the
multitude
to
feel
as
macpherson
might
have
felt
when
the
name
of
ossian
his
creation
passed
into
all
languages
and
in
truth
that
scottish
advocate
knew
one
of
the
keenest
or
at
any
rate
one
of
the
rarest
sensations
in
human
experience
what
was
this
but
the
incognito
of
genius
to
write
an
de
paris
a
is
to
take
one
s
share
in
the
glory
of
a
century
but
to
give
a
homer
to
one
s
country
this
surely
is
a
usurpation
of
the
rights
of
god
the
writer
is
too
well
acquainted
with
the
laws
of
narration
to
be
unaware
of
the
nature
of
the
pledge
given
by
this
brief
preface
but
at
the
same
time
he
knows
enough
of
the
history
of
the
thirteen
to
feel
confident
that
he
shall
not
disappoint
any
expectations
raised
by
the
programme
tragedies
dripping
with
gore
comedies
piled
up
with
horrors
tales
of
heads
taken
off
in
secret
have
been
confided
to
him
if
any
reader
has
not
had
enough
of
the
ghastly
tales
served
up
to
the
public
for
some
time
past
he
has
only
to
express
his
wish
the
author
is
in
a
position
to
reveal
atrocities
and
family
secrets
of
a
gloomy
and
astonishing
nature
but
in
preference
he
has
chosen
those
pleasanter
stories
in
which
stormy
passions
are
succeeded
by
purer
scenes
where
the
beauty
and
goodness
of
woman
shine
out
the
brighter
for
the
darkness
and
to
the
honor
of
the
thirteen
such
episodes
as
these
are
not
wanting
some
day
perhaps
it
may
be
thought
worth
while
to
give
their
whole
history
to
the
world
in
which
case
it
might
form
a
pendant
to
the
history
of
the
buccaneers
that
race
apart
so
curiously
energetic
so
attractive
in
spite
of
their
crimes
when
a
writer
has
a
true
story
to
tell
he
should
scorn
to
turn
it
into
a
sort
of
puzzle
toy
after
the
manner
of
those
novelists
who
take
their
reader
for
a
walk
through
one
cavern
after
another
to
show
him
a
corpse
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
volume
and
inform
him
by
way
of
conclusion
that
he
has
been
frightened
all
along
by
a
door
hidden
somewhere
or
other
behind
some
tapestry
or
a
dead
body
left
by
inadvertence
under
the
floor
so
the
present
chronicler
in
spite
of
his
objection
to
prefaces
felt
bound
to
introduce
his
fragment
by
a
few
remarks
the
first
episode
is
connected
by
invisible
links
with
the
history
of
the
thirteen
for
the
power
which
they
acquired
in
a
natural
manner
provides
the
apparently
supernatural
machinery
again
although
a
certain
literary
coquetry
may
be
permissible
to
retailers
of
the
marvelous
the
sober
chronicler
is
bound
to
forego
such
advantage
as
he
may
reap
from
an
name
on
which
many
ephemeral
successes
are
founded
in
these
days
wherefore
the
present
writer
gives
the
following
succinct
statement
of
the
reasons
which
induced
him
to
adopt
the
unlikely
sounding
title
and
in
accordance
with
custom
is
a
name
taken
by
the
head
of
a
guild
of
est
or
journeymen
every
chief
on
the
day
of
his
election
chooses
a
pseudonym
and
continues
a
dynasty
of
precisely
as
a
pope
changes
his
name
on
his
accession
to
the
triple
tiara
and
as
the
church
has
its
clement
gregory
julius
or
alexander
so
the
workmen
have
their
ferragus
tutanus
or
iv
who
are
the
do
you
ask
the
are
one
among
many
tribes
of
whose
origin
can
be
traced
to
a
great
mystical
association
formed
among
the
workmen
of
christendom
for
the
rebuilding
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
is
still
a
popular
institution
in
france
its
traditions
still
exert
a
power
over
little
enlightened
minds
over
men
so
uneducated
that
they
have
not
learned
to
break
their
oaths
and
the
various
organizations
might
be
turned
to
formidable
account
even
yet
if
any
man
of
genius
arose
to
make
use
of
them
for
his
instruments
would
be
for
the
most
part
almost
blind
wherever
journeymen
travel
they
find
a
hostel
for
which
has
been
in
existence
in
the
town
from
time
immemorial
the
as
they
call
it
is
a
kind
of
lodge
with
a
mother
in
charge
an
old
wife
who
has
nothing
to
lose
she
hears
all
that
goes
on
in
the
countryside
and
either
from
fear
or
from
long
habit
is
devoted
to
the
interests
of
the
tribe
boarded
and
lodged
by
her
and
as
a
result
this
shifting
population
subject
as
it
is
to
an
unalterable
law
of
custom
has
eyes
in
every
place
and
will
carry
out
an
order
anywhere
without
asking
questions
for
the
oldest
journeyman
is
still
at
an
age
when
a
man
has
some
beliefs
left
what
is
more
the
whole
fraternity
professes
doctrines
which
if
unfolded
never
so
little
are
both
true
enough
and
mysterious
enough
to
electrify
all
the
adepts
with
patriotism
and
the
are
so
attached
to
their
rules
that
there
have
been
bloody
battles
between
different
fraternities
on
a
question
of
principle
fortunately
however
for
peace
and
public
order
if
a
is
ambitious
he
takes
to
building
houses
makes
a
fortune
and
leaves
the
guild

great

curious
things
might
be
told
of
their
rivals
the
du
of
all
the
different
sects
of
workmen
their
manners
and
customs
and
brotherhoods
and
of
the
resemblances
between
them
and
the
freemasons
but
there
these
particulars
would
be
out
of
place
the
author
will
merely
add
that
before
the
revolution
a
had
been
known
in
the
king
s
service
which
is
to
say
that
he
had
the
tenure
of
a
place
in
his
majesty
s
galleys
for
one
hundred
and
one
years
but
even
thence
he
ruled
his
guild
and
was
religiously
consulted
on
all
matters
and
if
he
escaped
from
the
hulks
he
met
with
help
succor
and
respect
wherever
he
went
to
have
a
chief
in
the
hulks
is
one
of
those
misfortunes
for
which
providence
is
responsible
but
a
faithful
lodge
of
is
bound
as
before
to
obey
a
power
created
by
and
set
above
themselves
their
lawful
sovereign
is
in
exile
for
the
time
being
but
none
the
less
is
he
their
king
and
now
any
romantic
mystery
hanging
about
the
words
and
the
is
completely
dispelled
as
for
the
thirteen
the
author
feels
that
on
the
strength
of
the
details
of
this
almost
fantastic
story
he
can
afford
to
give
away
yet
another
prerogative
though
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
on
record
and
would
possibly
fetch
a
high
price
if
brought
into
a
literary
auction
mart
for
the
owner
might
inflict
as
many
volumes
on
the
public
as
la
contemporaine
a
long
series
of
memoirs
which
appeared
about
the
thirteen
were
all
of
them
men
tempered
like
byron
s
friend
trelawney
the
original
so
it
is
said
of
all
of
them
were
fatalists
men
of
spirit
and
poetic
temperament
all
of
them
were
tired
of
the
commonplace
life
which
they
led
all
felt
attracted
towards
asiatic
pleasures
by
all
the
vehement
strength
of
newly
awakened
and
long
dormant
forces
one
of
these
chancing
to
take
up
for
the
second
time
admired
the
sublime
friendship
between
pierre
and
jaffir
and
fell
to
musing
on
the
virtues
of
outlaws
the
loyalty
of
the
hulks
the
honor
of
thieves
and
the
immense
power
that
a
few
men
can
wield
if
they
bring
their
whole
minds
to
bear
upon
the
carrying
out
of
a
single
will
it
struck
him
that
the
individual
man
rose
higher
than
men
then
he
began
to
think
that
if
a
few
picked
men
should
band
themselves
together
and
if
to
natural
wit
and
education
and
money
they
could
join
a
fanaticism
hot
enough
to
fuse
as
it
were
all
those
separate
forces
into
a
single
one
then
the
whole
world
would
be
at
their
feet
from
that
time
forth
with
a
tremendous
power
of
concentration
they
could
wield
an
occult
power
against
which
the
organization
of
society
would
be
helpless
a
power
which
would
push
obstacles
aside
and
defeat
the
will
of
others
and
the
diabolical
power
of
all
would
be
at
the
service
of
each
a
hostile
world
apart
within
the
world
admitting
none
of
the
ideas
recognizing
none
of
the
laws
of
the
world
submitting
only
to
the
sense
of
necessity
obedient
only
from
devotion
acting
all
as
one
man
in
the
interests
of
the
comrade
who
should
claim
the
aid
of
the
rest
a
band
of
buccaneers
with
carriages
and
yellow
kid
gloves
a
close
confederacy
of
men
of
extraordinary
power
of
amused
and
cool
spectators
of
an
artificial
and
petty
world
which
they
cursed
with
smiling
lips
conscious
as
they
were
that
they
could
make
all
things
bend
to
their
caprice
weave
ingenious
schemes
of
revenge
and
live
with
the
life
in
thirteen
hearts
to
say
nothing
of
the
unfailing
pleasure
of
facing
the
world
of
men
with
a
hidden
misanthropy
a
sense
that
they
were
armed
against
their
kind
and
could
retire
into
themselves
with
one
idea
which
the
most
remarkable
men
had
not
all
this
constituted
a
religion
of
pleasure
and
egoism
which
made
fanatics
of
the
thirteen
the
history
of
the
society
of
jesus
was
repeated
for
the
devil
s
benefit
it
was
hideous
and
sublime
the
pact
was
made
and
it
lasted
precisely
because
it
seemed
impossible
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
in
paris
there
was
a
fraternity
of
thirteen
men
each
one
bound
body
and
soul
to
the
rest
and
all
of
them
strangers
to
each
other
in
the
sight
of
the
world
but
evening
found
them
gathered
together
like
conspirators
and
then
they
had
no
thoughts
apart
riches
like
the
wealth
of
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
they
possessed
in
common
they
had
their
feet
in
every
salon
their
hands
in
every
strong
box
their
elbows
in
the
streets
their
heads
upon
all
pillows
they
did
not
scruple
to
help
themselves
at
their
pleasure
no
chief
commanded
them
nobody
was
strong
enough
the
liveliest
passion
the
most
urgent
need
took
precedence
that
was
all
they
were
thirteen
unknown
kings
unknown
but
with
all
the
power
and
more
than
the
power
of
kings
for
they
were
both
judges
and
executioners
they
had
taken
wings
that
they
might
traverse
the
heights
and
depths
of
society
scorning
to
take
any
place
in
it
since
all
was
theirs
if
the
author
learns
the
reason
of
their
abdication
he
will
communicate
it
and
now
the
author
is
free
to
give
those
episodes
in
the
history
of
the
thirteen
which
by
reason
of
the
parisian
flavor
of
the
details
or
the
strangeness
of
the
contrasts
possessed
a
peculiar
attraction

him

certain
streets
in
paris
are
as
degraded
as
a
man
covered
with
infamy
also
there
are
noble
streets
streets
simply
respectable
young
streets
on
the
morality
of
which
the
public
has
not
yet
formed
an
opinion

estimable

streets
always
clean
streets
always
dirty

mercantile
streets
in
short
the
streets
of
paris
have
every
human
quality
and
impress
us
by
what
we
must
call
their
physiognomy
with
certain
ideas
against
which
we
are
defenceless
there
are
for
instance
streets
of
a
bad
neighborhood
in
which
you
could
not
be
induced
to
live
and
streets
where
you
would
willingly
take
up
your
abode
some
streets
like
the
rue
montmartre
have
a
charming
head
and
end
in
a
fish
s
tail
the
rue
de
la
paix
is
a
wide
street
a
fine
street
yet
it
wakens
none
of
those
gracefully
noble
thoughts
which
come
to
an
impressible
mind
in
the
middle
of
the
rue
royale
and
it
certainly
lacks
the
majesty
which
reigns
in
the
place

if
you
walk
the
streets
of

do
not
seek
the
reason
of
the
nervous
sadness
that
lays
hold
upon
you
save
in
the
solitude
of
the

the
gloomy

of
the

the
great
deserted

a
villainous
street
look
at
the
wretched
little
houses
with
two
windows
on
a
floor
where
vice

and
misery
abound
the
narrow
streets
exposed
to
the
north
where
the
sun
never
comes
more
than
three
or
four
times
a
year
are
the
streets
which
murder
with
impunity
the
authorities
of
the
present
day
do
not
meddle
with
them
but
in
former
times
the
parliament
might
perhaps
have
summoned
the
lieutenant
of
police
and
reprimanded
him
for
the
state
of
things
and
it
would
at
least
have
issued
some
decree
against
such
streets
as
it
once
did
against
the
wigs
of
the
chapter
of
beauvais
and
yet
monsieur
benoiston

chateauneuf
has
proved
that
the
mortality
of
these
streets
is
double
that
of
others
to
sum
up
such
theories
by
a
single
example
is
not
the

these
observations
incomprehensible
out
of

doubtless
be
understood
by
musing

of

poesy
and
pleasure
who
know
while
rambling
about

how
to
harvest
the
mass
of
floating
interests
which
may
be

at

there
are

few
amateurs
who
never

heedlessly
who
savor

who
know
its
physiognomy
so
well
that

that
monstrous
marvel
that
amazing
assemblage
of

of

of
thoughts
the
city
of

thousand
tales
the
head
of
the

but
to
those
few
paris
is
sad
or
gay
ugly
or
beautiful
living
or
dead
to
them
paris
is
a
creature
every
man
every
fraction
of
a
house
is
a
lobe
of
the
cellular
tissue
of
that
great
courtesan
whose
head
and
heart
and
fantastic
customs
they
know
so
well
these
men
are
lovers
of
paris
they
lift
their
noses
at
such
or
such
a
corner
of
a
street
certain
that
they
can
see
the
face
of
a
clock
they
tell
a
friend
whose
is
empty
go
down
that
passage
and
turn
to
the
left
there
s
a
tobacconist
next
door
to
a
confectioner
where
there
s
a
pretty
rambling
about
paris
is
to
these
poets
a
costly
luxury
how
can
they
help
spending
precious
minutes
before
the
dramas
disasters
faces
and
picturesque
events
which
meet
us
everywhere
amid
this
heaving
queen
of
cities
clothed
in
posters
who
has
nevertheless
not
a
single
clean
corner
so
complying
is
she
to
the
vices
of
the
french
nation
who
has
not
chanced
to
leave
his
home
early
in
the
morning
intending
to
go
to
some
extremity
of
paris
and
found
himself
unable
to
get
away
from
the
centre
of
it
by
the
such
a
man
will
know
how
to
excuse
this
vagabondizing
start
upon
our
tale
which
however
we
here
sum
up
in
an
observation
both
useful
and
novel
as
far
as
any
observation
can
be
novel
in
paris
where
there
is
nothing
new
not
even
the
statue
erected
yesterday
on
which
some
young
gamin
has
already
scribbled
his
name
well
then
there
are
streets
or
ends
of
streets
there
are
houses
unknown
for
the
most
part
to
persons
of
social
distinction
to
which
a
woman
of
that
class
can
not
go
without
causing
cruel
and
very
wounding
things
to
be
thought
of
her
whether
the
woman
be
rich
and
has
a
carriage
whether
she
is
on
foot
or
is
disguised
if
she
enters
one
of
these
parisian
defiles
at
any
hour
of
the
day
she
compromises
her
reputation
as
a
virtuous
woman
if
by
chance
she
is
there
at
nine
in
the
evening
the
conjectures
that
an
observer
permits
himself
to
make
upon
her
may
prove
fearful
in
their
consequences
but
if
the
woman
is
young
and
pretty
if
she
enters
a
house
in
one
of
those
streets
if
the
house
has
a
long
dark
damp
and
at
the
end
of
which
flickers
the
pallid
gleam
of
an
oil
lamp
and
if
beneath
that
gleam
appears
the
horrid
face
of
a
withered
old
woman
with
fleshless
fingers
ah
then
and
we
say
it
in
the
interests
of
young
and
pretty
women
that
woman
is
lost
she
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
man
of
her
acquaintance
who
sees
her
in
that
parisian
slough
there
is
more
than
one
street
in
paris
where
such
a
meeting
may
lead
to
a
frightful
drama
a
bloody
drama
of
death
and
love
a
drama
of
the
modern
school
unhappily
this
scene
this
modern
drama
itself
will
be
comprehended
by
only
a
small
number
of
persons
and
it
is
a
pity
to
tell
the
tale
to
a
public
which
can
not
enter
into
its
local
merit
but
who
can
flatter
himself
that
he
will
ever
be
understood
we
all
die
unknown
tis
the
saying
of
women
and
of
authors
at
eight
o
clock
one
evening
in
the
rue
pagevin
in
the
days
when
that
street
had
no
wall
which
did
not
echo
some
infamous
word
and
was
in
the
direction
of
the
rue
soly
the
narrowest
and
most
impassable
street
in
paris
not
excepting
the
least
frequented
corner
of
the
most
deserted
street
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
of
february
about
thirteen
years
ago
a
young
man
by
one
of
those
chances
which
come
but
once
in
life
turned
the
corner
of
the
rue
pagevin
to
enter
the
rue
des
close
to
the
rue
soly
there
this
young
man
who
lived
himself
in
the
rue
de
bourbon
saw
in
a
woman
near
whom
he
had
been
unconsciously
walking
a
vague
resemblance
to
the
prettiest
woman
in
paris
a
chaste
and
delightful
person
with
whom
he
was
secretly
and
passionately
in
love
a
love
without
hope
she
was
married
in
a
moment
his
heart
leaped
an
intolerable
heat
surged
from
his
centre
and
flowed
through
all
his
veins
his
back
turned
cold
the
skin
of
his
head
crept
he
loved
he
was
young
he
knew
paris
and
his
knowledge
did
not
permit
him
to
be
ignorant
of
all
there
was
of
possible
infamy
in
an
elegant
rich
young
and
beautiful
woman
walking
there
alone
with
a
furtively
criminal
step
in
that
mud
at
that
hour
the
love
that
this
young
man
felt
for
that
woman
may
seem
romantic
and
all
the
more
so
because
he
was
an
officer
in
the
royal
guard
if
he
had
been
in
the
infantry
the
affair
might
have
seemed
more
likely
but
as
an
officer
of
rank
in
the
cavalry
he
belonged
to
that
french
arm
which
demands
rapidity
in
its
conquests
and
derives
as
much
vanity
from
its
amorous
exploits
as
from
its
dashing
uniform
but
the
passion
of
this
officer
was
a
true
love
and
many
young
hearts
will
think
it
noble
he
loved
this
woman
because
she
was
virtuous
he
loved
her
virtue
her
modest
grace
her
imposing
saintliness
as
the
dearest
treasures
of
his
hidden
passion
this
woman
was
indeed
worthy
to
inspire
one
of
those
platonic
loves
which
are
found
like
flowers
amid
bloody
ruins
in
the
history
of
the
worthy
to
be
the
hidden
principle
of
all
the
actions
of
a
young
man
s
life
a
love
as
high
as
pure
as
the
skies
when
blue
a
love
without
hope
and
to
which
men
bind
themselves
because
it
can
never
deceive
a
love
that
is
prodigal
of
unchecked
enjoyment
especially
at
an
age
when
the
heart
is
ardent
the
imagination
keen
and
the
eyes
of
a
man
see
very
clearly
strange
weird
inconceivable
effects
may
be
met
with
at
night
in
paris
only
those
who
have
amused
themselves
by
watching
those
effects
have
any
idea
how
fantastic
a
woman
may
appear
there
at
dusk
at
times
the
creature
whom
you
are
following
by
accident
or
design
seems
to
you
light
and
slender
the
stockings
if
they
are
white
make
you
fancy
that
the
legs
must
be
slim
and
elegant
the
figure
though
wrapped
in
a
shawl
or
concealed
by
a
pelisse
defines
itself
gracefully
and
seductively
among
the
shadows
anon
the
uncertain
gleam
thrown
from
a
or
a
street
lamp
bestows
a
fleeting
lustre
nearly
always
deceptive
on
the
unknown
woman
and
fires
the
imagination
carrying
it
far
beyond
the
truth
the
senses
then
bestir
themselves
everything
takes
color
and
animation
the
woman
appears
in
an
altogether
novel
aspect
her
person
becomes
beautiful
behold
she
is
not
a
woman
she
is
a
demon
a
siren
who
is
drawing
you
by
magnetic
attraction
to
some
respectable
house
where
the
worthy
frightened
by
your
threatening
step
and
the
clack
of
your
boots
shuts
the
door
in
your
face
without
looking
at
you
a
vacillating
gleam
thrown
from
the
of
a
shoemaker
suddenly
illuminated
from
the
waist
down
the
figure
of
the
woman
who
was
before
the
young
man
ah
surely
alone
had
that
swaying
figure
she
alone
knew
the
secret
of
that
chaste
gait
which
innocently
set
into
relief
the
many
beauties
of
that
attractive
form
yes
that
was
the
shawl
and
that
the
velvet
bonnet
which
she
wore
in
the
mornings
on
her
gray
silk
stockings
not
a
spot
on
her
shoes
not
a
splash
the
shawl
held
tightly
round
the
bust
disclosed
vaguely
its
charming
lines
and
the
young
man
who
had
often
seen
those
shoulders
at
a
ball
knew
well
the
treasures
that
the
shawl
concealed
by
the
way
a
parisian
woman
wraps
a
shawl
around
her
and
the
way
she
lifts
her
feet
in
the
street
a
man
of
intelligence
in
such
studies
can
divine
the
secret
of
her
mysterious
errand
there
is
something
i
know
not
what
of
quivering
buoyancy
in
the
person
in
the
gait
the
woman
seems
to
weigh
less
she
steps
or
rather
she
glides
like
a
star
and
floats
onward
led
by
a
thought
which
exhales
from
the
folds
and
motion
of
her
dress
the
young
man
hastened
his
step
passed
the
woman
and
then
turned
back
to
look
at
her
pst
she
had
disappeared
into
a
the
grated
door
of
which
and
its
bell
still
rattled
and
sounded
the
young
man
walked
back
to
the
alley
and
saw
the
woman
reach
the
farther
end
where
she
began
to
mount
not
without
receiving
the
obsequious
bow
of
an
old
portress
a
winding
staircase
the
lower
steps
of
which
were
strongly
lighted
she
went
up
buoyantly
eagerly
as
though
impatient
impatient
for
what
said
the
young
man
to
himself
drawing
back
to
lean
against
a
wooden
railing
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
he
gazed
unhappy
man
at
the
different
storeys
of
the
house
with
the
keen
attention
of
a
detective
searching
for
a
conspirator
it
was
one
of
those
houses
of
which
there
are
thousands
in
paris
ignoble
vulgar
narrow
yellowish
in
tone
with
four
storeys
and
three
windows
on
each
floor
the
outer
blinds
of
the
first
floor
were
closed
where
was
she
going
the
young
man
fancied
he
heard
the
tinkle
of
a
bell
on
the
second
floor
as
if
in
answer
to
it
a
light
began
to
move
in
a
room
with
two
windows
strongly
illuminated
which
presently
lit
up
the
third
window
evidently
that
of
a
first
room
either
the
salon
or
the
of
the
apartment
instantly
the
outline
of
a
woman
s
bonnet
showed
vaguely
on
the
window
and
a
door
between
the
two
rooms
must
have
closed
for
the
first
was
dark
again
while
the
two
other
windows
resumed
their
ruddy
glow
at
this
moment
a
voice
said
hi
there
and
the
young
man
was
conscious
of
a
blow
on
his
shoulder
why
don
t
you
pay
attention
said
the
rough
voice
of
a
workman
carrying
a
plank
on
his
shoulder
the
man
passed
on
he
was
the
voice
of
providence
saying
to
the
watcher
what
are
you
meddling
with
think
of
your
own
duty
and
leave
these
parisians
to
their
own
the
young
man
crossed
his
arms
then
as
no
one
beheld
him
he
suffered
tears
of
rage
to
flow
down
his
cheeks
unchecked
at
last
the
sight
of
the
shadows
moving
behind
the
lighted
windows
gave
him
such
pain
that
he
looked
elsewhere
and
noticed
a
standing
against
a
wall
in
the
upper
part
of
the
rue
des
at
a
place
where
there
was
neither
the
door
of
a
house
nor
the
light
of
a
was
it
she
was
it
not
she
life
or
death
to
a
lover
this
lover
waited
he
stood
there
during
a
century
of
twenty
minutes
after
that
the
woman
came
down
and
he
then
recognized
her
as
the
one
whom
he
secretly
loved
nevertheless
he
wanted
still
to
doubt
she
went
to
the
and
got
into
it
the
house
will
always
be
there
and
i
can
search
it
later
thought
the
young
man
following
the
carriage
at
a
run
to
solve
his
last
doubts
and
soon
he
did
so
the
carriage
stopped
in
the
rue
de
richelieu
before
a
shop
for
artificial
flowers
close
to
the
rue
de
menars
the
lady
got
out
entered
the
shop
sent
out
the
money
to
pay
the
coachman
and
presently
left
the
shop
herself
on
foot
after
buying
a
bunch
of
marabouts
marabouts
for
her
black
hair
the
officer
beheld
her
through
the
placing
the
feathers
to
her
head
to
see
the
effect
and
he
fancied
he
could
hear
the
conversation
between
herself
and
the
oh
madame
nothing
is
more
suitable
for
brunettes
brunettes
have
something
a
little
too
strongly
marked
in
their
lines
and
marabouts
give
them
just
that
which
they
lack
madame
la
duchesse
de
langeais
says
they
give
a
woman
something
vague
ossianic
and
very
very
good
send
them
to
me
at
then
the
lady
turned
quickly
toward
the
rue
de
menars
and
entered
her
own
house
when
the
door
closed
on
her
the
young
lover
having
lost
his
hopes
and
worse
far
worse
his
dearest
beliefs
walked
through
the
streets
like
a
drunken
man
and
presently
found
himself
in
his
own
room
without
knowing
how
he
came
there
he
flung
himself
into
an
put
his
head
in
his
hands
and
his
feet
on
the
andirons
drying
his
boots
until
he
burned
them
it
was
an
awful
moment
one
of
those
moments
in
human
life
when
the
character
is
moulded
and
the
future
conduct
of
the
best
of
men
depends
on
the
good
or
evil
fortune
of
his
first
action
providence
or
fatality
choose
which
you
will
this
young
man
belonged
to
a
good
family
whose
nobility
was
not
very
ancient
but
there
are
so
few
really
old
families
in
these
days
that
all
men
of
rank
are
ancient
without
dispute
his
grandfather
had
bought
the
office
of
counsellor
to
the
parliament
of
paris
where
he
afterwards
became
president
his
sons
each
provided
with
a
handsome
fortune
entered
the
army
and
through
their
marriages
became
attached
to
the
court
the
revolution
swept
the
family
away
but
one
old
dowager
too
obstinate
to
emigrate
was
left
she
was
put
in
prison
threatened
with
death
but
was
saved
by
the
thermidor
and
recovered
her
property
when
the
proper
time
came
about
the
year
she
recalled
her
grandson
to
france
auguste
de
maulincour
the
only
scion
of
the
carbonnon
de
maulincour
was
brought
up
by
the
good
dowager
with
the
triple
care
of
a
mother
a
woman
of
rank
and
an
obstinate
dowager
when
the
restoration
came
the
young
man
then
eighteen
years
of
age
entered
the
followed
the
princes
to
ghent
was
made
an
officer
in
the
left
it
to
serve
in
the
line
but
was
recalled
later
to
the
royal
guard
where
at
years
of
age
he
found
himself
major
of
a
cavalry
regiment
a
splendid
position
due
to
his
grandmother
who
had
played
her
cards
well
to
obtain
it
in
spite
of
his
youth
this
double
biography
is
a
compendium
of
the
general
and
special
history
barring
variations
of
all
the
noble
families
who
emigrated
having
debts
and
property
dowagers
and
tact
madame
la
baronne
de
maulincour
had
a
friend
in
the
old
vidame
de
pamiers
formerly
a
commander
of
the
knights
of
malta
this
was
one
of
those
undying
friendships
founded
on
sexagenary
ties
which
nothing
can
weaken
because
at
the
bottom
of
such
intimacies
there
are
certain
secrets
of
the
human
heart
delightful
to
guess
at
when
we
have
the
time
insipid
to
explain
in
twenty
words
and
which
might
make
the
text
of
a
work
in
four
volumes
as
amusing
as
the
doyen
de
killerine
a
work
about
which
young
men
talk
and
judge
without
having
read
it
auguste
de
maulincour
belonged
therefore
to
the
faubourg
through
his
grandmother
and
the
vidame
and
it
sufficed
him
to
date
back
two
centuries
to
take
the
tone
and
opinions
of
those
who
assume
to
go
back
to
clovis
this
young
man
pale
slender
and
delicate
in
appearance
a
man
of
honor
and
true
courage
who
would
fight
a
duel
for
a
yes
or
a
no
had
never
yet
fought
upon
a
though
he
wore
in
his
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
he
was
as
you
perceive
one
of
the
blunders
of
the
restoration
perhaps
the
most
excusable
of
them
the
youth
of
those
days
was
the
youth
of
no
epoch
it
came
between
the
memories
of
the
empire
and
those
of
the
emigration
between
the
old
traditions
of
the
court
and
the
conscientious
education
of
the
between
religion
and
between
two
political
faiths
between
louis
who
saw
only
the
present
and
charles
who
looked
too
far
into
the
future
it
was
moreover
bound
to
accept
the
will
of
the
king
though
the
king
was
deceiving
and
tricking
it
this
unfortunate
youth
blind
and
yet
was
counted
as
nothing
by
old
men
jealously
keeping
the
reins
of
the
state
in
their
feeble
hands
while
the
monarchy
could
have
been
saved
by
their
retirement
and
the
accession
of
this
young
france
which
the
old
doctrinaires
the
of
the
restoration
still
speak
of
slightingly
auguste
de
maulincour
was
a
victim
to
the
ideas
which
weighed
in
those
days
upon
french
youth
and
we
must
here
explain
why
the
vidame
de
pamiers
was
still
at
years
of
age
a
very
brilliant
man
having
seen
much
and
lived
much
a
good
talker
a
man
of
honor
and
a
gallant
man
but
who
held
as
to
women
the
most
detestable
opinions
he
loved
them
and
he
despised
them
honor
feelings
rubbish
and
shams
when
he
was
with
them
he
believed
in
them
the
monstre
he
never
contradicted
them
and
he
made
them
shine
but
among
his
male
friends
when
the
topic
of
the
sex
came
up
he
laid
down
the
principle
that
to
deceive
women
and
to
carry
on
several
intrigues
at
once
should
be
the
occupation
of
those
young
men
who
were
so
misguided
as
to
wish
to
meddle
in
the
affairs
of
the
state
it
is
sad
to
have
to
sketch
so
hackneyed
a
portrait
for
has
it
not
figured
everywhere
and
become
literally
as
threadbare
as
that
of
a
grenadier
of
the
empire
but
the
vidame
had
an
influence
on
monsieur
de
maulincour
s
destiny
which
obliges
us
to
preserve
his
portrait
he
lectured
the
young
man
after
his
fashion
and
did
his
best
to
convert
him
to
the
doctrines
of
the
great
age
of
gallantry
the
dowager
a
pious
woman
sitting
between
god
and
her
vidame
a
model
of
grace
and
sweetness
but
gifted
with
that
persistency
which
triumphs
in
the
long
run
had
longed
to
preserve
for
her
grandson
the
beautiful
illusions
of
life
and
had
therefore
brought
him
up
in
the
highest
principles
she
instilled
into
him
her
own
delicacy
of
feeling
and
made
him
to
outward
appearance
a
timid
man
if
not
a
fool
the
sensibilities
of
the
young
fellow
preserved
pure
were
not
worn
by
contact
without
he
remained
so
chaste
so
scrupulous
that
he
was
keenly
offended
by
actions
and
maxims
to
which
the
world
attached
no
consequence
ashamed
of
this
susceptibility
he
forced
himself
to
conceal
it
under
a
false
hardihood
but
he
suffered
in
secret
all
the
while
scoffing
with
others
at
the
things
he
reverenced
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
deceived
because
in
accordance
with
a
not
uncommon
whim
of
destiny
he
a
man
of
gentle
melancholy
and
spiritual
in
love
encountered
in
the
object
of
his
first
passion
a
woman
who
held
in
horror
all
german
sentimentalism
the
young
man
in
consequence
distrusted
himself
became
dreamy
absorbed
in
his
griefs
complaining
of
not
being
understood
then
as
we
desire
all
the
more
violently
the
things
we
find
difficult
to
obtain
he
continued
to
adore
women
with
that
ingenuous
tenderness
and
feline
delicacy
the
secret
of
which
belongs
to
women
themselves
who
may
perhaps
prefer
to
keep
the
monopoly
of
it
in
point
of
fact
though
women
of
the
world
complain
of
the
way
men
love
them
they
have
little
liking
themselves
for
those
whose
soul
is
half
feminine
their
own
superiority
consists
in
making
men
believe
they
are
their
inferiors
in
love
therefore
they
will
readily
leave
a
lover
if
he
is
inexperienced
enough
to
rob
them
of
those
fears
with
which
they
seek
to
deck
themselves
those
delightful
tortures
of
feigned
jealousy
those
troubles
of
hope
betrayed
those
futile
expectations
in
short
the
whole
procession
of
their
feminine
miseries
they
hold
sir
charles
grandison
in
horror
what
can
be
more
contrary
to
their
nature
than
a
tranquil
perfect
love
they
want
emotions
happiness
without
storms
is
not
happiness
to
them
women
with
souls
that
are
strong
enough
to
bring
infinitude
into
love
are
angelic
exceptions
they
are
among
women
what
noble
geniuses
are
among
men
their
great
passions
are
rare
as
masterpieces
below
the
level
of
such
love
come
compromises
conventions
passing
and
contemptible
irritations
as
in
all
things
petty
and
perishable
amid
the
hidden
disasters
of
his
heart
and
while
he
was
still
seeking
the
woman
who
could
comprehend
him
a
search
which
let
us
remark
in
passing
is
one
of
the
amorous
follies
of
our
epoch
auguste

in
the
rank
of
society
that
was
farthest
from

secondary
sphere

perfect
being
one
of
those
women
who
have
i
know
not
what
about
them
that
is
saintly
and
sacred
women
who
inspire
such
reverence
that
love
has
need
of
the
help
of
a
long
familiarity
to
declare
itself
auguste
then
gave
himself
up
wholly
to
the
delights
of
the
deepest
and
most
moving
of
passions
to
a
love
that
was
purely
adoring
innumerable
repressed
desires
there
were
shadows
of
passion
so
vague
yet
so
profound
so
fugitive
and
yet
so
actual
that
one
scarcely
knows
to
what
we
may
compare
them
they
are
like
perfumes
or
clouds
or
rays
of
the
sun
or
shadows
or
whatever
there
is
in
nature
that
shines
for
a
moment
and
disappears
that
springs
to
life
and
dies
leaving
in
the
heart
long
echoes
of
emotion
when
the
soul
is
young
enough
to
nurture
melancholy
and
hope
to
find
in
woman
more
than
a
woman
is
it
not
the
greatest
happiness
that
can
befall
a
man
when
he
loves
enough
to
feel
more
joy
in
touching
a
gloved
hand
or
a
lock
of
hair
in
listening
to
a
word
in
casting
a
single
look
than
in
all
the
ardor
of
possession
given
by
happy
love
thus
it
is
that
rejected
persons
those
rebuffed
by
fate
the
ugly
and
unfortunate
lovers
unrevealed
women
and
timid
men
alone
know
the
treasures
contained
in
the
voice
of
the
beloved
taking
their
source
and
their
element
from
the
soul
itself
the
vibrations
of
the
air
charged
with
passion

our
hearts
so
powerfully
into
communion
carrying
thought
between
them
so
lucidly
and
being
above
all
so
incapable
of
falsehood
that
a
single
inflection
of
a
voice
is
often
a
revelation
what
enchantments
the
intonations
of
a
tender
voice
can
bestow
upon
the
heart
of
a
poet
what
ideas
they
awaken
what
freshness
they
shed
there
love
is
in
the
voice
before
the
glance
avows

auguste
poet
after
the
manner
of
lovers
there
are
poets
who
feel
and
poets
who
express
the
first
are
the
happiest
auguste
had
tasted
all
these
early
joys
so
vast
so
fecund
she
possessed
the
most
winning
organ
that
the
most
artful
woman
of
the
world
could
have
desired
in
order
to
deceive
at
her
ease
had
that
silvery
voice
which
is
soft
to
the
ear
and
ringing
only
for
the
heart
which
it
stirs
and
troubles
caresses
and
subjugates
and
this
woman
went
by
night
to
the
rue
soly
through
the
rue
pagevin
and
her
furtive
apparition
in
an
infamous
house
had
just
destroyed
the
grandest
of
passions
the
vidame
s
logic
triumphed
if
she
is
betraying
her
husband
we
will
avenge
ourselves
said
auguste
there
was
still
faith
in
that
if
the
philosophic
doubt
of
descartes
is
a
politeness
with
which
we
should
always
honor
virtue
ten
o
clock
sounded
the
baron
de
maulincour
remembered
that
this
woman
was
going
to
a
ball
that
evening
at
a
house
to
which
he
had
access
he
dressed
went
there
and
searched
for
her
through
all
the
salons
the
mistress
of
the
house
madame
de
nucingen
seeing
him
thus
occupied
said
you
are
looking
for
madame
jules
but
she
has
not
yet
good
evening
dear
said
a
voice
auguste
and
madame
de
nucingen
turned
round
madame
jules
had
arrived
dressed
in
white
looking
simple
and
noble
wearing
in
her
hair
the
marabouts
the
young
baron
had
seen
her
choose
in
the
that
voice
of
love
now
pierced
his
heart
had
he
won
the
slightest
right
to
be
jealous
of
her
he
would
have
petrified
her
then
and
there
by
saying
the
words
rue
soly
but
if
he
an
alien
to
her
life
had
said
those
words
in
her
ear
a
thousand
times
madame
jules
would
have
asked
him
in
astonishment
what
he
meant
he
looked
at
her
stupidly
for
those
sarcastic
persons
who
scoff
at
all
things
it
may
be
a
great
amusement
to
detect
the
secret
of
a
woman
to
know
that
her
chastity
is
a
lie
that
her
calm
face
hides
some
anxious
thought
that
under
that
pure
brow
is
a
dreadful
drama
but
there
are
other
souls
to
whom
the
sight
is
saddening
and
many
of
those
who
laugh
in
public
when
withdrawn
into
themselves
and
alone
with
their
conscience
curse
the
world
while
they
despise
the
woman
such
was
the
case
with
auguste
de
maulincour
as
he
stood
there
in
presence
of
madame
jules
singular
situation
there
was
no
other
relation
between
them
than
that
which
social
life
establishes
between
persons
who
exchange
a
few
words
seven
or
eight
times
in
the
course
of
a
winter
and
yet
he
was
calling
her
to
account
on
behalf
of
a
happiness
unknown
to
her
he
was
judging
her
without
letting
her
know
of
his
accusation
many
young
men
find
themselves
thus
in
despair
at
having
broken
forever
with
a
woman
adored
in
secret
condemned
and
despised
in
secret
there
are
many
hidden
monologues
told
to
the
walls
of
some
solitary
lodging
storms
roused
and
calmed
without
ever
leaving
the
depths
of
hearts
amazing
scenes
of
the
moral
world
for
which
a
painter
is
wanted
madame
jules
sat
down
leaving
her
husband
to
make
a
turn
around
the
salon
after
she
was
seated
she
seemed
uneasy
and
while
talking
with
her
neighbor
she
kept
a
furtive
eye
on
monsieur
jules
desmarets
her
husband
a
broker
chiefly
employed
by
the
baron
de
nucingen
the
following
is
the
history
of
their
home
life
monsieur
desmarets
was
five
years
before
his
marriage
in
a
broker
s
office
with
no
other
means
than
the
meagre
salary
of
a
clerk
but
he
was
a
man
to
whom
misfortune
had
early
taught
the
truths
of
life
and
he
followed
the
strait
path
with
the
tenacity
of
an
insect
making
for
its
nest
he
was
one
of
those
dogged
young
men
who
feign
death
before
an
obstacle
and
wear
out
everybody
s
patience
with
their
own
perseverance
thus
young
as
he
was
he
had
all
the
republican
virtue
of
poor
peoples
he
was
sober
saving
of
his
time
an
enemy
to
pleasure
he
waited
nature
had
given
him
the
immense
advantage
of
an
agreeable
exterior
his
calm
pure
brow
the
shape
of
his
placid
but
expressive
face
his
simple
manners
all
revealed
in
him
a
laborious
and
resigned
existence
that
lofty
personal
dignity
which
is
imposing
to
others
and
the
secret
nobility
of
heart
which
can
meet
all
events
his
modesty
inspired
a
sort
of
respect
in
those
who
knew
him
solitary
in
the
midst
of
paris
he
knew
the
social
world
only
by
glimpses
during
the
brief
moments
which
he
spent
in
his
patron
s
salon
on
holidays
there
were
passions
in
this
young
man
as
in
most
of
the
men
who
live
in
that
way
of
amazing
profundity
passions
too
vast
to
be
drawn
into
petty
incidents
his
want
of
means
compelled
him
to
lead
an
ascetic
life
and
he
conquered
his
fancies
by
hard
work
after
paling
all
day
over
figures
he
found
his
recreation
in
striving
obstinately
to
acquire
that
wide
general
knowledge
so
necessary
in
these
days
to
every
man
who
wants
to
make
his
mark
whether
in
society
or
in
commerce
at
the
bar
or
in
politics
or
literature
the
only
peril
these
fine
souls
have
to
fear
comes
from
their
own
uprightness
they
see
some
poor
girl
they
love
her
they
marry
her
and
wear
out
their
lives
in
a
struggle
between
poverty
and
love
the
noblest
ambition
is
quenched
perforce
by
the
household
jules
desmarets
went
headlong
into
this
peril
he
met
one
evening
at
his
patron
s
house
a
girl
of
the
rarest
beauty
unfortunate
men
who
are
deprived
of
affection
and
who
consume
the
finest
hours
of
youth
in
work
and
study
alone
know
the
rapid
ravages
that
passion
makes
in
their
lonely
misconceived
hearts
they
are
so
certain
of
loving
truly
all
their
forces
are
concentrated
so
quickly
on
the
object
of
their
love
that
they
receive
while
beside
her
the
most
delightful
sensations
when
as
often
happens
they
inspire
none
at
all
nothing
is
more
flattering
to
a
woman
s
egotism
than
to
divine
this
passion
apparently
immovable
and
these
emotions
so
deep
that
they
have
needed
a
great
length
of
time
to
reach
the
human
surface
these
poor
men
anchorites
in
the
midst
of
paris
have
all
the
enjoyments
of
anchorites
and
may
sometimes
succumb
to
temptations
but
more
often
deceived
betrayed
and
misunderstood
they
are
rarely
able
to
gather
the
sweet
fruits
of
a
love
which
to
them
is
like
a
flower
dropped
from
heaven
one
smile
from
his
wife
a
single
inflection
of
her
voice
sufficed
to
make
jules
desmarets
conceive
a
passion
which
was
boundless
happily
the
concentrated
fire
of
that
secret
passion
revealed
itself
artlessly
to
the
woman
who
inspired
it
these
two
beings
then
loved
each
other
religiously
to
express
all
in
a
word
they
clasped
hands
without
shame
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
went
their
way
like
two
children
brother
and
sister
passing
serenely
through
a
crowd
where
all
made
way
for
them
and
admired
them
the
young
girl
was
in
one
of
those
unfortunate
positions
which
human
selfishness
entails
upon
children
she
had
no
civil
status
her
name
of
clemence
and
her
age
were
recorded
only
by
a
notary
public
as
for
her
fortune
that
was
small
indeed
jules
desmarets
was
a
happy
man
on
hearing
these
particulars
if
clemence
had
belonged
to
an
opulent
family
he
might
have
despaired
of
obtaining
her
but
she
was
only
the
poor
child
of
love
the
fruit
of
some
terrible
adulterous
passion
and
they
were
married
then
began
for
jules
desmarets
a
series
of
fortunate
events
every
one
envied
his
happiness
and
henceforth
talked
only
of
his
luck
without
recalling
either
his
virtues
or
his
courage
some
days
after
their
marriage
the
mother
of
clemence
who
passed
in
society
for
her
godmother
told
jules
desmarets
to
buy
the
office
and
of
a
broker
promising
to
provide
him
with
the
necessary
capital
in
those
days
such
offices
could
still
be
bought
at
a
modest
price
that
evening
in
the
salon
as
it
happened
of
his
patron
a
wealthy
capitalist
proposed
on
the
recommendation
of
the
mother
a
very
advantageous
transaction
for
jules
desmarets
and
the
next
day
the
happy
clerk
was
able
to
buy
out
his
patron
in
four
years
desmarets
became
one
of
the
most
prosperous
men
in
his
business
new
clients
increased
the
number
his
predecessor
had
left
to
him
he
inspired
confidence
in
all
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
feel
by
the
way
business
came
to
him
that
some
hidden
influence
due
to
his
or
to
providence
was
secretly
protecting
him
at
the
end
of
the
third
year
clemence
lost
her
godmother
by
that
time
monsieur
jules
so
called
to
distinguish
him
from
an
elder
brother
whom
he
had
set
up
as
a
notary
in
paris
possessed
an
income
from
invested
property
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
there
was
not
in
all
paris
another
instance
of
the
domestic
happiness
enjoyed
by
this
couple
for
five
years
their
exceptional
love
had
been
troubled
by
only
one
event
a
calumny
for
which
monsieur
jules
exacted
vengeance
one
of
his
former
comrades
attributed
to
madame
jules
the
fortune
of
her
husband
explaining
that
it
came
from
a
high
protection
dearly
paid
for
the
man
who
uttered
the
calumny
was
killed
in
the
duel
that
followed
it
the
profound
passion
of
this
couple
which
survived
marriage
obtained
a
great
success
in
society
though
some
women
were
annoyed
by
it
the
charming
household
was
respected
everybody
feted
it
monsieur
and
madame
jules
were
sincerely
liked
perhaps
because
there
is
nothing
more
delightful
to
see
than
happy
people
but
they
never
stayed
long
at
any
festivity
they
slipped
away
early
as
impatient
to
regain
their
nest
as
wandering
pigeons
this
nest
was
a
large
and
beautiful
mansion
in
the
rue
de
menars
where
a
true
feeling
for
art
tempered
the
luxury
which
the
financial
world
continues
traditionally
to
display
here
the
happy
pair
received
their
society
magnificently
although
the
obligations
of
social
life
suited
them
but
little
nevertheless
jules
submitted
to
the
demands
of
the
world
knowing
that
sooner
or
later
a
family
has
need
of
it
but
he
and
his
wife
felt
themselves
in
its
midst
like
plants
in
a
tempest
with
a
delicacy
that
was
very
natural
jules
had
concealed
from
his
wife
the
calumny
and
the
death
of
the
calumniator
madame
jules
herself
was
inclined
through
her
sensitive
and
artistic
nature
to
desire
luxury
in
spite
of
the
terrible
lesson
of
the
duel
some
imprudent
women
whispered
to
each
other
that
madame
jules
must
sometimes
be
pressed
for
money
they
often
found
her
more
elegantly
dressed
in
her
own
home
than
when
she
went
into
society
she
loved
to
adorn
herself
to
please
her
husband
wishing
to
show
him
that
to
her
he
was
more
than
any
social
life
a
true
love
a
pure
love
above
all
a
happy
love
jules
always
a
lover
and
more
in
love
as
time
went
by
was
happy
in
all
things
beside
his
wife
even
in
her
caprices
in
fact
he
would
have
been
uneasy
if
she
had
none
thinking
it
a
symptom
of
some
illness
auguste
de
maulincour
had
the
personal
misfortune
of
running
against
this
passion
and
falling
in
love
with
the
wife
beyond
recovery
nevertheless
though
he
carried
in
his
heart
so
intense
a
love
he
was
not
ridiculous
he
complied
with
all
the
demands
of
society
and
of
military
manners
and
customs
and
yet
his
face
wore
constantly
even
though
he
might
be
drinking
a
glass
of
champagne
that
dreamy
look
that
air
of
silently
despising
life
that
nebulous
expression
which
belongs
though
for
other
reasons
to
men
men
dissatisfied
with
hollow
lives
to
love
without
hope
to
be
disgusted
with
life
constitute
in
these
days
a
social
position
the
enterprise
of
winning
the
heart
of
a
sovereign
might
give
perhaps
more
hope
than
a
love
rashly
conceived
for
a
happy
woman
therefore
maulincour
had
sufficient
reason
to
be
grave
and
gloomy
a
queen
has
the
vanity
of
her
power
the
height
of
her
elevation
protects
her
but
a
pious
is
like
a
hedgehog
or
an
oyster
in
its
rough
wrappings
at
this
moment
the
young
officer
was
beside
his
unconscious
mistress
who
certainly
was
unaware
that
she
was
doubly
faithless
madame
jules
was
seated
in
a
naive
attitude
like
the
least
artful
woman
in
existence
soft
and
gentle
full
of
a
majestic
serenity
what
an
abyss
is
human
nature
before
beginning
a
conversation
the
baron
looked
alternately
at
the
wife
and
at
the
husband
how
many
were
the
reflections
he
made
he
recomposed
the
night
thoughts
of
young
in
a
second
and
yet
the
music
was
sounding
through
the
salons
the
light
was
pouring
from
a
thousand
candles
it
was
a
banker
s
ball
one
of
those
insolent
festivals
by
means
of
which
the
world
of
solid
gold
endeavored
to
sneer
at
the
salons
where
the
faubourg
met
and
laughed
not
foreseeing
the
day
when
the
bank
would
invade
the
luxembourg
and
take
its
seat
upon
the
throne
the
conspirators
were
now
dancing
indifferent
to
coming
bankruptcies
whether
of
power
or
of
the
bank
the
gilded
salons
of
the
baron
de
nucingen
were
gay
with
that
peculiar
animation
that
the
world
of
paris
apparently
joyous
at
any
rate
gives
to
its
fetes
there
men
of
talent
communicate
their
wit
to
fools
and
fools
communicate
that
air
of
enjoyment
that
characterizes
them
by
means
of
this
exchange
all
is
liveliness
but
a
ball
in
paris
always
resembles
fireworks
to
a
certain
extent
wit
coquetry
and
pleasure
sparkle
and
go
out
like
rockets
the
next
day
all
present
have
forgotten
their
wit
their
coquetry
their
pleasure
ah
thought
auguste
by
way
of
conclusion
women
are
what
the
vidame
says
they
are
certainly
all
those
dancing
here
are
less
irreproachable
actually
than
madame
jules
appears
to
be
and
yet
madame
jules
went
to
the
rue
soly
the
rue
soly
was
like
an
illness
to
him
the
very
word
shrivelled
his
heart
madame
do
you
ever
dance
he
said
to
her
this
is
the
third
time
you
have
asked
me
that
question
this
winter
she
answered
smiling
but
perhaps
you
have
never
answered
that
is
i
knew
very
well
that
you
were
false
like
other
madame
jules
continued
to
smile
listen
monsieur
she
said
if
i
told
you
the
real
reason
you
would
think
it
ridiculous
i
do
not
think
it
false
to
abstain
from
telling
things
that
the
world
would
laugh
all
secrets
demand
in
order
to
be
told
a
friendship
of
which
i
am
no
doubt
unworthy
madame
but
you
can
not
have
any
but
noble
secrets
do
you
think
me
capable
of
jesting
on
noble
things
yes
she
said
you
like
all
the
rest
laugh
at
our
purest
sentiments
you
calumniate
them
besides
i
have
no
secrets
i
have
the
right
to
love
my
husband
in
the
face
of
all
the
world
and
i
say
so
i
am
proud
of
it
and
if
you
laugh
at
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
dance
only
with
him
i
shall
have
a
bad
opinion
of
your
have
you
never
danced
since
your
marriage
with
any
one
but
your
husband
never
his
arm
is
the
only
one
on
which
i
have
leaned
i
have
never
felt
the
touch
of
another
has
your
physician
never
felt
your
pulse
now
you
are
laughing
at
no
madame
i
admire
you
because
i
comprehend
you
but
you
let
a
man
hear
your
voice
you
let
yourself
be
seen
you
in
short
you
permit
our
eyes
to
admire
you
ah
she
said
interrupting
him
that
is
one
of
my
griefs
yes
i
wish
it
were
possible
for
a
married
woman
to
live
secluded
with
her
husband
as
a
mistress
lives
with
her
lover
for
then
then
why
were
you
two
hours
ago
on
foot
disguised
in
the
rue
soly
the
rue
soly
where
is
that
and
her
pure
voice
gave
no
sign
of
any
emotion
no
feature
of
her
face
quivered
she
did
not
blush
she
remained
calm
what
you
did
not
go
up
to
the
second
floor
of
a
house
in
the
rue
des
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
soly
you
did
not
have
a
waiting
near
by
you
did
not
return
in
it
to
the
in
the
rue
richelieu
where
you
bought
the
feathers
that
are
now
in
your
hair
i
did
not
leave
my
house
this
as
she
uttered
that
lie
she
was
smiling
and
imperturbable
she
played
with
her
fan
but
if
any
one
had
passed
a
hand
down
her
back
they
would
perhaps
have
found
it
moist
at
that
instant
auguste
remembered
the
instructions
of
the
vidame
then
it
was
some
one
who
strangely
resembled
you
he
said
with
a
credulous
air
monsieur
she
replied
if
you
are
capable
of
following
a
woman
and
detecting
her
secrets
you
will
allow
me
to
say
that
it
is
a
wrong
a
very
wrong
thing
and
i
do
you
the
honor
to
say
that
i
disbelieve
the
baron
turned
away
placed
himself
before
the
fireplace
and
seemed
thoughtful
he
bent
his
head
but
his
eyes
were
covertly
fixed
on
madame
jules
who
not
remembering
the
reflections
in
the
mirror
cast
two
or
three
glances
at
him
that
were
full
of
terror
presently
she
made
a
sign
to
her
husband
and
rising
took
his
arm
to
walk
about
the
salon
as
she
passed
before
monsieur
de
maulincour
who
at
that
moment
was
speaking
to
a
friend
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
as
if
in
reply
to
a
remark
that
woman
will
certainly
not
sleep
quietly
this
madame
jules
stopped
gave
him
an
imposing
look
which
expressed
contempt
and
continued
her
way
unaware
that
another
look
if
surprised
by
her
husband
might
endanger
not
only
her
happiness
but
the
lives
of
two
men
auguste
frantic
with
anger
which
he
tried
to
smother
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
presently
left
the
house
swearing
to
penetrate
to
the
heart
of
the
mystery
before
leaving
he
sought
madame
jules
to
look
at
her
again
but
she
had
disappeared
what
a
drama
cast
into
that
young
head
so
eminently
romantic
like
all
who
have
not
known
love
in
the
wide
extent
which
they
give
to
it
he
adored
madame
jules
under
a
new
aspect
he
loved
her
now
with
the
fury
of
jealousy
and
the
frenzied
anguish
of
hope
unfaithful
to
her
husband
the
woman
became
common
auguste
could
now
give
himself
up
to
the
joys
of
successful
love
and
his
imagination
opened
to
him
a
career
of
pleasures
yes
he
had
lost
the
angel
but
he
had
found
the
most
delightful
of
demons
he
went
to
bed
building
castles
in
the
air
excusing
madame
jules
by
some
romantic
fiction
in
which
he
did
not
believe
he
resolved
to
devote
himself
wholly
from
that
day
forth
to
a
search
for
the
causes
motives
and
keynote
of
this
mystery
it
was
a
tale
to
read
or
better
still
a
drama
to
be
played
in
which
he
had
a
part

a

thing
is
the
task
of
a
spy
when
performed

it
not
giving
ourselves
the
pleasure
of
a

and
a
rascal
while
continuing

men
but
there
is
another
side
to
it
we
must
resign
ourselves
to
boil
with
anger
to
roar
with
impatience
to
freeze
our
feet
in
the
mud
to
be
numbed
and
roasted
and
torn
by
false
hopes
we
must

on

after
all
it
is
a
chase
a

a
hunt
in

a
hunt
with
all
its
chances
minus
dogs
and
guns
and
the
nothing
compares
with
it
but
the
life
of
gamblers
but
it
needs
a
heart
big
with
love
and
vengeance
to
ambush
itself
in
paris
like
a
tiger
waiting
to
spring
upon
its
prey
and
to
enjoy
the
chances
and
contingencies
of
paris
by
adding
one
special
interest
to
the
many
that
abound
there
but
for
this
we
need
a
soul
for
must
we
not
live
in
a
thousand
passions
a
thousand
sentiments
auguste
de
maulincour
flung
himself
into
this
ardent
existence
passionately
for
he
felt
all
its
pleasures
and
all
its
misery
he
went
disguised
about
paris
watching
at
the
corners
of
the
rue
pagevin
and
the
rue
des
he
hurried
like
a
hunter
from
the
rue
de
menars
to
the
rue
soly
and
back
from
the
rue
soly
to
the
rue
de
menars
without
obtaining
either
the
vengeance
or
the
knowledge
which
would
punish
or
reward
such
cares
such
efforts
such
wiles
but
he
had
not
yet
reached
that
impatience
which
wrings
our
very
entrails
and
makes
us
sweat
he
roamed
in
hope
believing
that
madame
jules
would
only
refrain
for
a
few
days
from
revisiting
the
place
where
she
knew
she
had
been
detected
he
devoted
the
first
days
therefore
to
a
careful
study
of
the
secrets
of
the
street
a
novice
at
such
work
he
dared
not
question
either
the
porter
or
the
shoemaker
of
the
house
to
which
madame
jules
had
gone
but
he
managed
to
obtain
a
post
of
observation
in
a
house
directly
opposite
to
the
mysterious
apartment
he
studied
the
ground
trying
to
reconcile
the
conflicting
demands
of
prudence
impatience
love
and
secrecy
early
in
the
month
of
march
while
busy
with
plans
by
which
he
expected
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
he
left
his
post
about
four
in
the
afternoon
after
one
of
those
patient
watches
from
which
he
had
learned
nothing
he
was
on
his
way
to
his
own
house
whither
a
matter
relating
to
his
military
service
called
him
when
he
was
overtaken
in
the
rue
coquilliere
by
one
of
those
heavy
showers
which
instantly
flood
the
gutters
while
each
drop
of
rain
rings
loudly
in
the
puddles
of
the
roadway
a
pedestrian
under
these
circumstances
is
forced
to
stop
short
and
take
refuge
in
a
shop
or
cafe
if
he
is
rich
enough
to
pay
for
the
forced
hospitality
or
if
in
poorer
circumstances
under
a
that
haven
of
paupers
or
shabbily
dressed
persons
why
have
none
of
our
painters
ever
attempted
to
reproduce
the
physiognomies
of
a
swarm
of
parisians
grouped
under
stress
of
weather
in
the
damp
of
a
building
first
there
s
the
musing
philosophical
pedestrian
who
observes
with
interest
all
he
sees
whether
it
be
the
stripes
made
by
the
rain
on
the
gray
background
of
the
atmosphere
a
species
of
chasing
not
unlike
the
capricious
threads
of
spun
glass
or
the
whirl
of
white
water
which
the
wind
is
driving
like
a
luminous
dust
along
the
roofs
or
the
fitful
disgorgements
of
the
sparkling
and
foaming
in
short
the
thousand
nothings
to
be
admired
and
studied
with
delight
by
loungers
in
spite
of
the
porter
s
broom
which
pretends
to
be
sweeping
out
the
gateway
then
there
s
the
talkative
refugee
who
complains
and
converses
with
the
porter
while
he
rests
on
his
broom
like
a
grenadier
on
his
musket
or
the
pauper
wayfarer
curled
against
the
wall
indifferent
to
the
condition
of
his
rags
long
used
alas
to
contact
with
the
streets
or
the
learned
pedestrian
who
studies
spells
and
reads
the
posters
on
the
walls
without
finishing
them
or
the
smiling
pedestrian
who
makes
fun
of
others
to
whom
some
street
fatality
has
happened
who
laughs
at
the
muddy
women
and
makes
grimaces
at
those
of
either
sex
who
are
looking
from
the
windows
and
the
silent
being
who
gazes
from
floor
to
floor
and
the
armed
with
a
satchel
or
a
paper
bundle
who
is
estimating
the
rain
as
a
profit
or
loss
and
the
fugitive
who
arrives
like
a
shot
exclaiming
ah
what
weather
messieurs
what
weather
and
bows
to
every
one
and
finally
the
true
of
paris
with
his
unfailing
umbrella
an
expert
in
showers
who
foresaw
this
particular
one
but
would
come
out
in
spite
of
his
wife
this
one
takes
a
seat
in
the
porter
s
chair
according
to
individual
character
each
member
of
this
fortuitous
society
contemplates
the
skies
and
departs
skipping
to
avoid
the
mud
because
he
is
in
a
hurry
or
because
he
sees
other
citizens
walking
along
in
spite
of
wind
and
slush
or
because
the
archway
being
damp
and
mortally
catarrhal
the
bed
s
edge
as
the
proverb
says
is
better
than
the
sheets
each
one
has
his
motive
no
one
is
left
but
the
prudent
pedestrian
the
man
who
before
he
sets
forth
makes
sure
of
a
scrap
of
blue
sky
through
the
rifting
clouds
monsieur
de
maulincour
took
refuge
as
we
have
said
with
a
whole
family
of
fugitives
under
the
porch
of
an
old
house
the
of
which
looked
like
the
flue
of
a
chimney
the
sides
of
its
plastered
nitrified
and
mouldy
walls
were
so
covered
with
pipes
and
conduits
from
all
the
many
floors
of
its
four
elevations
that
it
might
have
been
said
to
resemble
at
that
moment
the
of
water
flowed
everywhere
it
boiled
it
leaped
it
murmured
it
was
black
white
blue
and
green
it
shrieked
it
bubbled
under
the
broom
of
the
portress
a
toothless
old
woman
used
to
storms
who
seemed
to
bless
them
as
she
swept
into
the
street
a
mass
of
scraps
an
intelligent
inventory
of
which
would
have
revealed
the
lives
and
habits
of
every
dweller
in
the
house
bits
of
printed
cottons
artificial
faded
and
worthless
vegetable
parings
papers
scraps
of
metal
at
every
sweep
of
her
broom
the
old
woman
bared
the
soul
of
the
gutter
that
black
fissure
on
which
a
porter
s
mind
is
ever
bent
the
poor
lover
examined
this
scene
like
a
thousand
others
which
our
heaving
paris
presents
daily
but
he
examined
it
mechanically
as
a
man
absorbed
in
thought
when
happening
to
look
up
he
found
himself
all
but
nose
to
nose
with
a
man
who
had
just
entered
the
gateway
in
appearance
this
man
was
a
beggar
but
not
the
parisian
beggar
that
creation
without
a
name
in
human
language
no
this
man
formed
another
type
while
presenting
on
the
outside
all
the
ideas
suggested
by
the
word
he
was
not
marked
by
those
original
parisian
characteristics
which
strike
us
so
forcibly
in
the
paupers
whom
charlet
was
fond
of
representing
with
his
rare
luck
in
observation
coarse
faces
reeking
of
mud
hoarse
voices
reddened
and
bulbous
noses
mouths
devoid
of
teeth
but
menacing
humble
yet
terrible
beings
in
whom
a
profound
intelligence
shining
in
their
eyes
seems
like
a
contradiction
some
of
these
bold
vagabonds
have
blotched
cracked
veiny
skins
their
foreheads
are
covered
with
wrinkles
their
hair
scanty
and
dirty
like
a
wig
thrown
on
a
all
are
gay
in
their
degradation
and
degraded
in
their
joys
all
are
marked
with
the
stamp
of
debauchery
casting
their
silence
as
a
reproach
their
very
attitude
revealing
fearful
thoughts
placed
between
crime
and
beggary
they
have
no
compunctions
and
circle
prudently
around
the
scaffold
without
mounting
it
innocent
in
the
midst
of
crime
and
vicious
in
their
innocence
they
often
cause
a
laugh
but
they
always
cause
reflection
one
represents
to
you
civilization
stunted
repressed
he
comprehends
everything
the
honor
of
the
galleys
patriotism
virtue
the
malice
of
a
vulgar
crime
or
the
fine
astuteness
of
elegant
wickedness
another
is
resigned
a
perfect
mimer
but
stupid
all
have
slight
yearnings
after
order
and
work
but
they
are
pushed
back
into
their
mire
by
society
which
makes
no
inquiry
as
to
what
there
may
be
of
great
men
poets
intrepid
souls
and
splendid
organizations
among
these
vagrants
these
gypsies
of
paris
a
people
eminently
good
and
eminently
evil
like
all
the
masses
who
suffer
accustomed
to
endure
unspeakable
woes
and
whom
a
fatal
power
holds
ever
down
to
the
level
of
the
mire
they
all
have
a
dream
a
hope
a
happiness
cards
lottery
or
wine
there
was
nothing
of
all
this
in
the
personage
who
now
leaned
carelessly
against
the
wall
in
front
of
monsieur
de
maulincour
like
some
fantastic
idea
drawn
by
an
artist
on
the
back
of
a
canvas
the
front
of
which
is
turned
to
the
wall
this
tall
spare
man
whose
leaden
visage
expressed
some
deep
but
chilling
thought
dried
up
all
pity
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
looked
at
him
by
the
scowling
look
and
the
sarcastic
attitude
which
announced
an
intention
of
treating
every
man
as
an
equal
his
face
was
of
a
dirty
white
and
his
wrinkled
skull
denuded
of
hair
bore
a
vague
resemblance
to
a
block
of
granite
a
few
gray
locks
on
either
side
of
his
head
fell
straight
to
the
collar
of
his
greasy
coat
which
was
buttoned
to
the
chin
he
resembled
both
voltaire
and
don
quixote
he
was
apparently
scoffing
but
melancholy
full
of
disdain
and
philosophy
but
he
seemed
to
have
no
shirt
his
beard
was
long
a
rusty
black
cravat
much
worn
and
ragged
exposed
a
protuberant
neck
deeply
furrowed
with
veins
as
thick
as
cords
a
large
brown
circle
like
a
bruise
was
strongly
marked
beneath
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
at
least
sixty
years
old
his
hands
were
white
and
clean
his
boots
were
trodden
down
at
the
heels
and
full
of
holes
a
pair
of
blue
trousers
mended
in
various
places
were
covered
with
a
species
of
fluff
which
made
them
offensive
to
the
eye
whether
it
was
that
his
damp
clothes
exhaled
a
fetid
odor
or
that
he
had
in
his
normal
condition
the
poor
smell
which
belongs
to
parisian
tenements
just
as
offices
sacristies
and
hospitals
have
their
own
peculiar
and
rancid
fetidness
of
which
no
words
can
give
the
least
idea
or
whether
some
other
reason
affected
them
those
in
the
vicinity
of
this
man
immediately
moved
away
and
left
him
alone
he
cast
upon
them
and
also
upon
the
officer
a
calm
expressionless
look
the
celebrated
look
of
monsieur
de
talleyrand
a
dull
wan
glance
without
warmth
a
species
of
impenetrable
veil
beneath
which
a
strong
soul
hides
profound
emotions
and
close
estimation
of
men
and
things
and
events
not
a
fold
of
his
face
quivered
his
mouth
and
forehead
were
impassible
but
his
eyes
moved
and
lowered
themselves
with
a
noble
almost
tragic
slowness
there
was
in
fact
a
whole
drama
in
the
motion
of
those
withered
eyelids
the
aspect
of
this
stoical
figure
gave
rise
in
monsieur
de
maulincour
to
one
of
those
vagabond
reveries
which
begin
with
a
common
question
and
end
by
comprising
a
world
of
thought
the
storm
was
past
monsieur
de
maulincour
presently
saw
no
more
of
the
man
than
the
tail
of
his
coat
as
it
brushed
the
but
as
he
turned
to
leave
his
own
place
he
noticed
at
his
feet
a
letter
which
must
have
fallen
from
the
unknown
beggar
when
he
took
as
the
baron
had
seen
him
take
a
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
the
young
man
picked
it
up
and
read
involuntarily
the
address
to
monsieur
ferragusse
rue
des
corner
of
rue
the
letter
bore
no
postmark
and
the
address
prevented
monsieur
de
maulincour
from
following
the
beggar
and
returning
it
for
there
are
few
passions
that
will
not
fail
in
rectitude
in
the
long
run
the
baron
had
a
presentiment
of
the
opportunity
afforded
by
this
windfall
he
determined
to
keep
the
letter
which
would
give
him
the
right
to
enter
the
mysterious
house
to
return
it
to
the
strange
man
not
doubting
that
he
lived
there
suspicions
vague
as
the
first
faint
gleams
of
daylight
made
him
fancy
relations
between
this
man
and
madame
jules
a
jealous
lover
supposes
everything
and
it
is
by
supposing
everything
and
selecting
the
most
probable
of
their
conjectures
that
judges
spies
lovers
and
observers
get
at
the
truth
they
are
looking
for
is
the
letter
for
him
is
it
from
madame
jules
his
restless
imagination
tossed
a
thousand
such
questions
to
him
but
when
he
read
the
first
words
of
the
letter
he
smiled
here
it
is
textually
in
all
the
simplicity
of
its
artless
phrases
and
its
miserable
orthography
a
letter
to
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
add
anything
or
to
take
anything
away
unless
it
were
the
letter
itself
but
we
have
yielded
to
the
necessity
of
punctuating
it
in
the
original
there
were
neither
commas
nor
stops
of
any
kind
not
even
notes
of
exclamation
a
fact
which
tends
to
undervalue
the
system
of
notes
and
dashes
by
which
modern
authors
have
endeavored
to
depict
the
great
disasters
of
all
the
passions
henry
among
the
manny
sacrifisis
i
imposed
upon
myself
for
your
sake
was
that
of

but
the
only
frend

heart
has

and
will
never
forget
ida
this
life
of
a
young
girl
with
its
love
betrayed
its
fatal
joys
its
pangs
its
miseries
and
its
horrible
resignation
summed
up
in
a
few
words
this
humble
poem
essentially
parisian
written
on
dirty
paper
influenced
for
a
passing
moment
monsieur
de
maulincour
he
asked
himself
whether
this
ida
might
not
be
some
poor
relation
of
madame
jules
and
that
strange
rendezvous
which
he
had
witnessed
by
chance
the
mere
necessity
of
a
charitable
effort
but
could
that
old
pauper
have
seduced
this
ida
there
was
something
impossible
in
the
very
idea
wandering
in
this
labyrinth
of
reflections
which
crossed
recrossed
and
obliterated
one
another
the
baron
reached
the
rue
pagevin
and
saw
a
standing
at
the
end
of
the
rue
des
where
it
enters
the
rue
montmartre
all
waiting
now
had
an
interest
for
him
can
she
be
there
he
thought
to
himself
and
his
heart
beat
fast
with
a
hot
and
feverish
throbbing
he
pushed
the
little
door
with
the
bell
but
he
lowered
his
head
as
he
did
so
obeying
a
sense
of
shame
for
a
voice
said
to
him
secretly
why
are
you
putting
your
foot
into
this
mystery
he
went
up
a
few
steps
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
old
portress
monsieur
ferragus
he
said
don
t
know
doesn
t
monsieur
ferragus
live
here
haven
t
such
a
name
in
the
but
my
good
woman
i
m
not
your
good
woman
monsieur
i
m
the
but
madame
persisted
the
baron
i
have
a
letter
for
monsieur
ah
if
monsieur
has
a
letter
she
said
changing
her
tone
that
s
another
matter
will
you
let
me
see
it
that
letter
auguste
showed
the
folded
letter
the
old
woman
shook
her
head
with
a
doubtful
air
hesitated
seemed
to
wish
to
leave
the
lodge
and
inform
the
mysterious
ferragus
of
his
unexpected
visitor
but
finally
said
very
good
go
up
monsieur
i
suppose
you
know
the
way
without
replying
to
this
remark
which
he
thought
might
be
a
trap
the
young
officer
ran
lightly
up
the
stairway
and
rang
loudly
at
the
door
of
the
second
floor
his
lover
s
instinct
told
him
she
is
the
beggar
of
the
porch
ferragus
the
orther
of
ida
s
woes
opened
the
door
himself
he
appeared
in
a
flowered
white
flannel
trousers
his
feet
in
embroidered
slippers
and
his
face
washed
clean
of
stains
madame
jules
whose
head
projected
beyond
the
casing
of
the
door
in
the
next
room
turned
pale
and
dropped
into
a
chair
what
is
the
matter
madame
cried
the
officer
springing
toward
her
but
ferragus
stretched
forth
an
arm
and
flung
the
intruder
back
with
so
sharp
a
thrust
that
auguste
fancied
he
had
received
a
blow
with
an
iron
bar
full
on
his
chest
back
monsieur
said
the
man
what
do
you
want
there
for
five
or
six
days
you
have
been
roaming
about
the
neighborhood
are
you
a
spy
are
you
monsieur
ferragus
said
the
baron
no
nevertheless
continued
auguste
it
is
to
you
that
i
must
return
this
paper
which
you
dropped
in
the
gateway
beneath
which
we
both
took
refuge
from
the
while
speaking
and
offering
the
letter
to
the
man
auguste
did
not
refrain
from
casting
an
eye
around
the
room
where
ferragus
received
him
it
was
very
well
arranged
though
simply
a
fire
burned
on
the
hearth
and
near
it
was
a
table
with
food
upon
it
which
was
served
more
sumptuously
than
agreed
with
the
apparent
conditions
of
the
man
and
the
poorness
of
his
lodging
on
a
sofa
in
the
next
room
which
he
could
see
through
the
doorway
lay
a
heap
of
gold
and
he
heard
a
sound
which
could
be
no
other
than
that
of
a
woman
weeping
the
paper
belongs
to
me
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
said
the
mysterious
man
turning
away
as
if
to
make
the
baron
understand
that
he
must
go
too
curious
himself
to
take
much
note
of
the
deep
examination
of
which
he
was
himself
the
object
auguste
did
not
see
the
glance
with
which
this
strange
being
seemed
to
pierce
him
had
he
encountered
that
basilisk
eye
he
might
have
felt
the
danger
that
encompassed
him
too
passionately
excited
to
think
of
himself
auguste
bowed
went
down
the
stairs
and
returned
home
striving
to
find
a
meaning
in
the
connection
of
these
three
persons
ida
ferragus
and
madame
jules
an
occupation
equivalent
to
that
of
trying
to
arrange
the
bits
of
a
chinese
puzzle
without
possessing
the
key
to
the
game
but
madame
jules
had
seen
him
madame
jules
went
there
madame
jules
had
lied
to
him
maulincour
determined
to
go
and
see
her
the
next
day
she
could
not
refuse
his
visit
for
he
was
now
her
accomplice
he
was
hands
and
feet
in
the
mysterious
affair
and
she
knew
it
already
he
felt
himself
a
sultan
and
thought
of
demanding
from
madame
jules
imperiously
all
her
secrets
in
those
days
paris
was
seized
with
a
if
paris
is
a
monster
it
is
certainly
a
most
monster
it
becomes
enamored
of
a
thousand
fancies
sometimes
it
has
a
mania
for
building
like
a
great
seigneur
who
loves
a
trowel
soon
it
abandons
the
trowel
and
becomes
all
military
it
arrays
itself
from
head
to
foot
as
a
national
guard
and
drills
and
smokes
suddenly
it
abandons
military
manoeuvres
and
flings
away
cigars
it
is
commercial
falls
into
bankruptcy
sells
its
furniture
on
the
place
de
chatelet
files
its
schedule
but
a
few
days
later
lo
it
has
arranged
its
affairs
and
is
giving
fetes
and
dances
one
day
it
eats
by
the
mouthful
by
the
handful
yesterday
it
bought
papier
weymen
the
monster
s
teeth
ache
and
it
applies
to
its
walls
an
alexipharmatic
to
mitigate
their
dampness
it
will
lay
in
a
provision
of
pectoral
paste
it
has
its
manias
for
the
month
for
the
season
for
the
year
like
its
manias
of
a
day
so
at
the
moment
of
which
we
speak
all
the
world
was
building
or
pulling
down
something
people
hardly
knew
what
as
yet
there
were
very
few
streets
in
which
high
scaffoldings
on
long
poles
could
not
be
seen
fastened
from
floor
to
floor
with
transverse
blocks
inserted
into
holes
in
the
walls
on
which
the
planks
were
laid
a
frail
construction
shaken
by
the
but
held
together
by
ropes
white
with
plaster
and
insecurely
protected
from
the
wheels
of
carriages
by
the
breastwork
of
planks
which
the
law
requires
round
all
such
buildings
there
is
something
maritime
in
these
masts
and
ladders
and
cordage
even
in
the
shouts
of
the
masons
about
a
dozen
yards
from
the
hotel
maulincour
one
of
these
ephemeral
barriers
was
erected
before
a
house
which
was
then
being
built
of
blocks
of
the
day
after
the
event
we
have
just
related
at
the
moment
when
the
baron
de
maulincour
was
passing
this
scaffolding
in
his
cabriolet
on
his
way
to
see
madame
jules
a
stone
two
feet
square
which
was
being
raised
to
the
upper
storey
of
this
building
got
loose
from
the
ropes
and
fell
crushing
the
baron
s
servant
who
was
behind
the
cabriolet
a
cry
of
horror
shook
both
the
scaffold
and
the
masons
one
of
them
apparently
unable
to
keep
his
grasp
on
a
pole
was
in
danger
of
death
and
seemed
to
have
been
touched
by
the
stone
as
it
passed
him
a
crowd
collected
rapidly
the
masons
came
down
the
ladders
swearing
and
insisting
that
monsieur
de
maulincour
s
cabriolet
had
been
driven
against
the
boarding
and
so
had
shaken
their
crane
two
inches
more
and
the
stone
would
have
fallen
on
the
baron
s
head
the
groom
was
dead
the
carriage
shattered
twas
an
event
for
the
whole
neighborhood
the
newspapers
told
of
it
monsieur
de
maulincour
certain
that
he
had
not
touched
the
boarding
complained
the
case
went
to
court
inquiry
being
made
it
was
shown
that
a
small
boy
armed
with
a
lath
had
mounted
guard
and
called
to
all
to
keep
away
the
affair
ended
there
monsieur
de
maulincour
obtained
no
redress
he
had
lost
his
servant
and
was
confined
to
his
bed
for
some
days
for
the
back
of
the
carriage
when
shattered
had
bruised
him
severely
and
the
nervous
shock
of
the
sudden
surprise
gave
him
a
fever
he
did
not
therefore
go
to
see
madame
jules
ten
days
after
this
event
he
left
the
house
for
the
first
time
in
his
repaired
cabriolet
when
as
he
drove
down
the
rue
de
bourgogne
and
was
close
to
the
sewer
opposite
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
the
broke
in
two
and
the
baron
was
driving
so
rapidly
that
the
breakage
would
have
caused
the
two
wheels
to
come
together
with
force
enough
to
break
his
head
had
it
not
been
for
the
resistance
of
the
leather
hood
nevertheless
he
was
badly
wounded
in
the
side
for
the
second
time
in
ten
days
he
was
carried
home
in
a
fainting
condition
to
his
terrified
grandmother
this
second
accident
gave
him
a
feeling
of
distrust
he
thought
though
vaguely
of
ferragus
and
madame
jules
to
throw
light
on
these
suspicions
he
had
the
broken
axle
brought
to
his
room
and
sent
for
his
the
man
examined
the
axle
and
the
fracture
and
proved
two
things
first
the
axle
was
not
made
in
his
workshop
he
furnished
none
that
did
not
bear
the
initials
of
his
name
on
the
iron
but
he
could
not
explain
by
what
means
this
axle
had
been
substituted
for
the
other
secondly
the
breakage
of
the
suspicious
axle
was
caused
by
a
hollow
space
having
been
blown
in
it
and
a
straw
very
cleverly
inserted
eh
monsieur
le
baron
whoever
did
that
was
malicious
he
said
any
one
would
swear
to
look
at
it
that
the
axle
was
monsieur
de
maulincour
begged
the
to
say
nothing
of
the
affair
but
he
felt
himself
warned
these
two
attempts
at
murder
were
planned
with
an
ability
which
denoted
the
enmity
of
intelligent
minds
it
is
war
to
the
death
he
said
to
himself
as
he
tossed
in
his
bed
a
war
of
savages
skulking
in
ambush
of
trickery
and
treachery
declared
in
the
name
of
madame
jules
what
sort
of
man
is
this
to
whom
she
belongs
what
species
of
power
does
this
ferragus
wield
monsieur
de
maulincour
though
a
soldier
and
brave
man
could
not
repress
a
shudder
in
the
midst
of
many
thoughts
that
now
assailed
him
there
was
one
against
which
he
felt
he
had
neither
defence
nor
courage
might
not
poison
be
employed
ere
long
by
his
secret
enemies
under
the
influence
of
fears
which
his
momentary
weakness
and
fever
and
low
diet
increased
he
sent
for
an
old
woman
long
attached
to
the
service
of
his
grandmother
whose
affection
for
himself
was
one
of
those
sentiments
which
are
the
sublime
of
the
commonplace
without
confiding
in
her
wholly
he
charged
her
to
buy
secretly
and
daily
in
different
localities
the
food
he
needed
telling
her
to
keep
it
under
lock
and
key
and
bring
it
to
him
herself
not
allowing
any
one
no
matter
who
to
approach
her
while
preparing
it
he
took
the
most
minute
precautions
to
protect
himself
against
that
form
of
death
he
was
ill
in
his
bed
and
alone
and
he
had
therefore
the
leisure
to
think
of
his
own
security
the
one
necessity
enough
to
enable
human
egotism
to
forget
nothing
but
the
unfortunate
man
had
poisoned
his
own
life
by
this
dread
and
in
spite
of
himself
suspicion
dyed
all
his
hours
with
its
gloomy
tints
these
two
lessons
of
attempted
assassination
did
teach
him
however
the
value
of
one
of
the
virtues
most
necessary
to
a
public
man
he
saw
the
wise
dissimulation
that
must
be
practised
in
dealing
with
the
great
interests
of
life
to
be
silent
about
our
own
secret
is
nothing
but
to
be
silent
from
the
start
to
forget
a
fact
as
ali
pacha
did
for
thirty
years
in
order
to
be
sure
of
a
vengeance
waited
for
for
thirty
years
is
a
fine
study
in
a
land
where
there
are
few
men
who
can
keep
their
own
counsel
for
thirty
days
monsieur
de
maulincour
literally
lived
only
through
madame
jules
he
was
perpetually
absorbed
in
a
sober
examination
into
the
means
he
ought
to
employ
to
triumph
in
this
mysterious
struggle
with
these
mysterious
persons
his
secret
passion
for
that
woman
grew
by
reason
of
all
these
obstacles
madame
jules
was
ever
there
erect
in
the
midst
of
his
thoughts
in
the
centre
of
his
heart
more
seductive
by
her
presumable
vices
than
by
the
positive
virtues
for
which
he
had
made
her
his
idol
at
last
anxious
to
reconnoitre
the
position
of
the
enemy
he
thought
he
might
without
danger
initiate
the
vidame
into
the
secrets
of
his
situation
the
old
commander
loved
auguste
as
a
father
loves
his
wife
s
children
he
was
shrewd
dexterous
and
very
diplomatic
he
listened
to
the
baron
shook
his
head
and
they
both
held
counsel
the
worthy
vidame
did
not
share
his
young
friend
s
confidence
when
auguste
declared
that
in
the
time
in
which
they
now
lived
the
police
and
the
government
were
able
to
lay
bare
all
mysteries
and
that
if
it
were
absolutely
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
those
powers
he
should
find
them
most
powerful
auxiliaries
the
old
man
replied
gravely
the
police
my
dear
boy
is
the
most
incompetent
thing
on
this
earth
and
government
the
feeblest
in
all
matters
concerning
individuals
neither
the
police
nor
the
government
can
read
hearts
what
we
might
reasonably
ask
of
them
is
to
search
for
the
causes
of
an
act
but
the
police
and
the
government
are
both
eminently
unfitted
for
that
they
lack
essentially
the
personal
interest
which
reveals
all
to
him
who
wants
to
know
all
no
human
power
can
prevent
an
assassin
or
a
poisoner
from
reaching
the
heart
of
a
prince
or
the
stomach
of
an
honest
man
passions
are
the
best
the
vidame
strongly
advised
the
baron
to
go
to
italy
and
from
italy
to
greece
from
greece
to
syria
from
syria
to
asia
and
not
to
return
until
his
secret
enemies
were
convinced
of
his
repentance
and
would
so
make
tacit
peace
with
him
but
if
he
did
not
take
that
course
then
the
vidame
advised
him
to
stay
in
the
house
and
even
in
his
own
room
where
he
would
be
safe
from
the
attempts
of
this
man
ferragus
and
not
to
leave
it
until
he
could
be
certain
of
crushing
him
we
should
never
touch
an
enemy
until
we
can
be
sure
of
taking
his
head
off
he
said
gravely
the
old
man
however
promised
his
favorite
to
employ
all
the
astuteness
with
which
heaven
had
provided
him
without
compromising
any
one
in
reconnoitring
the
enemy
s
ground
and
laying
his
plans
for
future
victory
the
commander
had
in
his
service
a
retired
figaro
the
wiliest
monkey
that
ever
walked
in
human
form
in
earlier
days
as
clever
as
a
devil
working
his
body
like
a
alert
as
a
thief
sly
as
a
woman
but
now
fallen
into
the
decadence
of
genius
for
want
of
practice
since
the
new
constitution
of
parisian
society
which
has
reformed
even
the
valets
of
comedy
this
scapin
emeritus
was
attached
to
his
master
as
to
a
superior
being
but
the
shrewd
old
vidame
added
a
good
round
sum
yearly
to
the
wages
of
his
former
provost
of
gallantry
which
strengthened
the
ties
of
natural
affection
by
the
bonds
of
and
obtained
for
the
old
gentleman
as
much
care
as
the
most
loving
mistress
could
bestow
on
a
sick
friend
it
was
this
pearl
of
the
relic
of
the
last
century
auxiliary
incorruptible
from
lack
of
passions
to
satisfy
on
whom
the
old
vidame
and
monsieur
de
maulincour
now
relied
monsieur
le
baron
will
spoil
all
said
the
great
man
in
livery
when
called
into
counsel
monsieur
should
eat
drink
and
sleep
in
peace
i
take
the
whole
matter
upon
accordingly
eight
days
after
the
conference
when
monsieur
de
maulincour
perfectly
restored
to
health
was
breakfasting
with
his
grandmother
and
the
vidame
justin
entered
to
make
his
report
as
soon
as
the
dowager
had
returned
to
her
own
apartments
he
said
with
that
mock
modesty
which
men
of
talent
are
so
apt
to
affect
ferragus
is
not
the
name
of
the
enemy
who
is
pursuing
monsieur
le
baron
this
man
this
devil
rather
is
called
gratien
henri
victor
bourignard
the
sieur
gratien
bourignard
is
a
former
once
very
rich
and
above
all
one
of
the
handsomest
men
of
his
day
in
paris
a
lovelace
capable
of
seducing
grandison
my
information
stops
short
there
he
has
been
a
simple
workman
and
the
companions
of
the
order
of
the
devorants
did
at
one
time
elect
him
as
their
chief
under
the
title
of
ferragus
xxiii
the
police
ought
to
know
that
if
the
police
were
instituted
to
know
anything
the
man
has
moved
from
the
rue
des
and
now
roosts
rue
joquelet
where
madame
jules
desmarets
goes
frequently
to
see
him
sometimes
her
husband
on
his
way
to
the
bourse
drives
her
as
far
as
the
rue
vivienne
or
she
drives
her
husband
to
the
bourse
monsieur
le
vidame
knows
about
these
things
too
well
to
want
me
to
tell
him
if
it
is
the
husband
who
takes
the
wife
or
the
wife
who
takes
the
husband
but
madame
jules
is
so
pretty
i
d
bet
on
her
all
that
i
have
told
you
is
positive
bourignard
often
plays
at
number
saving
your
presence
monsieur
he
s
a
rogue
who
loves
women
and
he
has
his
little
ways
like
a
man
of
condition
as
for
the
rest
he
wins
sometimes
disguises
himself
like
an
actor
paints
his
face
to
look
like
anything
he
chooses
and
lives
i
may
say
the
most
original
life
in
the
world
i
don
t
doubt
he
has
a
good
many
lodgings
for
most
of
the
time
he
manages
to
evade
what
monsieur
le
vidame
calls
parliamentary
if
monsieur
wishes
he
could
be
disposed
of
honorably
seeing
what
his
habits
are
it
is
always
easy
to
get
rid
of
a
man
who
loves
women
however
this
capitalist
talks
about
moving
again
have
monsieur
le
vidame
and
monsieur
le
baron
any
other
commands
to
give
me
justin
i
am
satisfied
with
you
don
t
go
any
farther
in
the
matter
without
my
orders
but
keep
a
close
watch
here
so
that
monsieur
le
baron
may
have
nothing
to
my
dear
boy
continued
the
vidame
when
they
were
alone
go
back
to
your
old
life
and
forget
madame
no
no
said
auguste
i
will
never
yield
to
gratien
bourignard
i
will
have
him
bound
hand
and
foot
and
madame
jules
that
evening
the
baron
auguste
de
maulincour
recently
promoted
to
higher
rank
in
the
company
of
the
of
the
king
went
to
a
ball
given
by
madame
la
duchesse
de
berry
at
the
there
certainly
no
danger
could
lurk
for
him
and
yet
before
he
left
the
palace
he
had
an
affair
of
honor
on
his
hands
an
affair
it
was
impossible
to
settle
except
by
a
duel
his
adversary
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
considered
that
he
had
strong
reasons
to
complain
of
monsieur
de
maulincour
who
had
given
some
ground
for
it
during
his
former
intimacy
with
monsieur
de
ronquerolles
sister
the
comtesse
de
serizy
that
lady
the
one
who
detested
german
sentimentality
was
all
the
more
exacting
in
the
matter
of
prudery
by
one
of
those
inexplicable
fatalities
auguste
now
uttered
a
harmless
jest
which
madame
de
serizy
took
amiss
and
her
brother
resented
it
the
discussion
took
place
in
the
corner
of
a
room
in
a
low
voice
in
good
society
adversaries
never
raise
their
voices
the
next
day
the
faubourg
and
the
chateau
talked
over
the
affair
madame
de
serizy
was
warmly
defended
and
all
the
blame
was
laid
on
maulincour
august
personages
interfered
seconds
of
the
highest
distinction
were
imposed
on
messieurs
de
maulincour
and
de
ronquerolles
and
every
precaution
was
taken
on
the
ground
that
no
one
should
be
killed
when
auguste
found
himself
face
to
face
with
his
antagonist
a
man
of
pleasure
to
whom
no
one
could
possibly
deny
sentiments
of
the
highest
honor
he
felt
it
was
impossible
to
believe
him
the
instrument
of
ferragus
chief
of
the
devorants
and
yet
he
was
compelled
as
it
were
by
an
inexplicable
presentiment
to
question
the
marquis
messieurs
he
said
to
the
seconds
i
certainly
do
not
refuse
to
meet
the
fire
of
monsieur
de
ronquerolles
but
before
doing
so
i
here
declare
that
i
was
to
blame
and
i
offer
him
whatever
excuses
he
may
desire
and
publicly
if
he
wishes
it
because
when
the
matter
concerns
a
woman
nothing
i
think
can
degrade
a
man
of
honor
i
therefore
appeal
to
his
generosity
and
good
sense
is
there
not
something
rather
silly
in
fighting
without
a
cause
monsieur
de
ronquerolles
would
not
allow
of
this
way
of
ending
the
affair
and
then
the
baron
his
suspicions
revived
walked
up
to
him
well
then
monsieur
le
marquis
he
said
pledge
me
in
presence
of
these
gentlemen
your
word
as
a
gentleman
that
you
have
no
other
reason
for
vengeance
than
that
you
have
chosen
to
put
monsieur
that
is
a
question
you
have
no
right
to
so
saying
monsieur
de
ronquerolles
took
his
place
it
was
agreed
in
advance
that
the
adversaries
were
to
be
satisfied
with
one
exchange
of
shots
monsieur
de
ronquerolles
in
spite
of
the
great
distance
determined
by
the
seconds
which
seemed
to
make
the
death
of
either
party
problematical
if
not
impossible
brought
down
the
baron
the
ball
went
through
the
latter
s
body
just
below
the
heart
but
fortunately
without
doing
vital
injury
you
aimed
too
well
monsieur
said
the
baron
to
be
avenging
only
a
paltry
and
he
fainted
monsieur
de
ronquerolles
who
believed
him
to
be
a
dead
man
smiled
sardonically
as
he
heard
those
words
after
a
fortnight
during
which
time
the
dowager
and
the
vidame
gave
him
those
cares
of
old
age
the
secret
of
which
is
in
the
hands
of
long
experience
only
the
baron
began
to
return
to
life
but
one
morning
his
grandmother
dealt
him
a
crushing
blow
by
revealing
anxieties
to
which
in
her
last
days
she
was
now
subjected
she
showed
him
a
letter
signed
f
in
which
the
history
of
her
grandson
s
secret
espionage
was
recounted
step
by
step
the
letter
accused
monsieur
de
maulincour
of
actions
that
were
unworthy
of
a
man
of
honor
he
had
it
said
placed
an
old
woman
at
the
stand
of
in
the
rue
de
menars
an
old
spy
who
pretended
to
sell
water
from
her
cask
to
the
coachmen
but
who
was
really
there
to
watch
the
actions
of
madame
jules
desmarets
he
had
spied
upon
the
daily
life
of
a
most
inoffensive
man
in
order
to
detect
his
secrets
secrets
on
which
depended
the
lives
of
three
persons
he
had
brought
upon
himself
a
relentless
struggle
in
which
although
he
had
escaped
with
life
three
times
he
must
inevitably
succumb
because
his
death
had
been
sworn
and
would
be
compassed
if
all
human
means
were
employed
upon
it
monsieur
de
maulincour
could
no
longer
escape
his
fate
by
even
promising
to
respect
the
mysterious
life
of
these
three
persons
because
it
was
impossible
to
believe
the
word
of
a
gentleman
who
had
fallen
to
the
level
of
a
and
for
what
reason
merely
to
trouble
the
respectable
life
of
an
innocent
woman
and
a
harmless
old
man
the
letter
itself
was
nothing
to
auguste
in
comparison
to
the
tender
reproaches
of
his
grandmother
to
lack
respect
to
a
woman
to
spy
upon
her
actions
without
a
right
to
do
so
ought
a
man
ever
to
spy
upon
a
woman
whom
he
loved
in
short
she
poured
out
a
torrent
of
those
excellent
reasons
which
prove
nothing
and
they
put
the
young
baron
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
into
one
of
those
great
human
furies
in
which
are
born
and
from
which
issue
the
most
vital
actions
of
a
man
s
life
since
it
is
war
to
the
knife
he
said
in
conclusion
i
shall
kill
my
enemy
by
any
means
that
i
can
lay
hold
the
vidame
went
immediately
at
auguste
s
request
to
the
chief
of
the
private
police
of
paris
and
without
bringing
madame
jules
name
or
person
into
the
narrative
although
they
were
really
the
gist
of
it
he
made
the
official
aware
of
the
fears
of
the
family
of
maulincour
about
this
mysterious
person
who
was
bold
enough
to
swear
the
death
of
an
officer
of
the
guards
in
defiance
of
the
law
and
the
police
the
chief
pushed
up
his
green
spectacles
in
amazement
blew
his
nose
several
times
and
offered
snuff
to
the
vidame
who
to
save
his
dignity
pretended
not
to
use
tobacco
although
his
own
nose
was
discolored
with
it
then
the
chief
took
notes
and
promised
vidocq
and
his
spies
aiding
to
send
in
a
report
within
a
few
days
to
the
maulincour
family
assuring
them
meantime
that
there
were
no
secrets
for
the
police
of
paris
a
few
days
after
this
the
police
official
called
to
see
the
vidame
at
the
hotel
de
maulincour
where
he
found
the
young
baron
quite
recovered
from
his
last
wound
he
gave
them
in
bureaucratic
style
his
thanks
for
the
indications
they
had
afforded
him
and
told
them
that
bourignard
was
a
convict
condemned
to
twenty
years
hard
labor
who
had
miraculously
escaped
from
a
gang
which
was
being
transported
from
bicetre
to
toulon
for
thirteen
years
the
police
had
been
endeavoring
to
recapture
him
knowing
that
he
had
boldly
returned
to
paris
but
so
far
this
convict
had
escaped
the
most
active
search
although
he
was
known
to
be
mixed
up
in
many
nefarious
deeds
however
the
man
whose
life
was
full
of
very
curious
incidents
would
certainly
be
captured
now
in
one
or
other
of
his
several
domiciles
and
delivered
up
to
justice
the
bureaucrat
ended
his
report
by
saying
to
monsieur
de
maulincour
that
if
he
attached
enough
importance
to
the
matter
to
wish
to
witness
the
capture
of
bourignard
he
might
come
the
next
day
at
eight
in
the
morning
to
a
house
in
the
rue
of
which
he
gave
him
the
number
monsieur
de
maulincour
excused
himself
from
going
personally
in
search
of
certainty
trusting
with
the
sacred
respect
inspired
by
the
police
of
paris
in
the
capability
of
the
authorities
three
days
later
hearing
nothing
and
seeing
nothing
in
the
newspapers
about
the
projected
arrest
which
was
certainly
of
enough
importance
to
have
furnished
an
article
monsieur
de
maulincour
was
beginning
to
feel
anxieties
which
were
presently
allayed
by
the
following
letter
monsieur
le
baron
i
have
the
honor
to
announce
to
you
that
you
need
have
no
further
uneasiness
touching
the
affair
in
question
the
man
named
gratien
bourignard
otherwise
called
ferragus
died
yesterday
at
his
lodgings
rue
joquelet
no
the
suspicions
we
naturally
conceived
as
to
the
identity
of
the
dead
body
have
been
completely
set
at
rest
by
the
facts
the
physician
of
the
prefecture
of
police
was
despatched
by
us
to
assist
the
physician
of
the
arrondissement
and
the
chief
of
the
detective
police
made
all
the
necessary
verifications
to
obtain
absolute
certainty
moreover
the
character
of
the
persons
who
signed
the
certificate
of
death
and
the
affidavits
of
those
who
took
care
of
the
said
bourignard
in
his
last
illness
among
others
that
of
the
worthy
vicar
of
the
church
of
the
to
whom
he
made
his
last
confession
for
he
died
a
christian
do
not
permit
us
to
entertain
any
sort
of
doubt
accept
monsieur
le
baron
etc
monsieur
de
maulincour
the
dowager
and
the
vidame
breathed
again
with
joy
unspeakable
the
good
old
woman
kissed
her
grandson
leaving
a
tear
upon
his
cheek
and
went
away
to
thank
god
in
prayer
the
dear
soul
who
was
making
a
novena
for
auguste
s
safety
believed
her
prayers
were
answered
well
said
the
vidame
now
you
had
better
show
yourself
at
the
ball
you
were
speaking
of
i
oppose
no
further
chapter
iii
the
wife
accused
monsieur
de
maulincour
was
all
the
more
anxious
to
go
to
this
ball
because
he
knew
that
madame
jules
would
be
present
the
fete
was
given
by
the
prefect
of
the
seine
in
whose
salons
the
two
social
worlds
of
paris
met
as
on
neutral
ground
auguste
passed
through
the
rooms
without
finding
the
woman
who
now
exercised
so
mighty
an
influence
on
his
fate
he
entered
an
empty
boudoir
where
were
placed
awaiting
players
and
sitting
down
on
a
divan
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
most
contradictory
thoughts
about
her
a
man
presently
took
the
young
officer
by
the
arm
and
looking
up
the
baron
was
stupefied
to
behold
the
pauper
of
the
rue
coquilliere
the
ferragus
of
ida
the
lodger
in
the
rue
soly
the
bourignard
of
justin
the
convict
of
the
police
and
the
dead
man
of
the
day
before
monsieur
not
a
sound
not
a
word
said
bourignard
whose
voice
he
recognized
the
man
was
elegantly
dressed
he
wore
the
order
of
the
and
a
medal
on
his
coat
monsieur
he
continued
and
his
voice
was
sibilant
like
that
of
a
hyena
you
increase
my
efforts
against
you
by
having
recourse
to
the
police
you
will
perish
monsieur
it
has
now
become
necessary
do
you
love
madame
jules
are
you
beloved
by
her
by
what
right
do
you
trouble
her
peaceful
life
and
blacken
her
virtue
some
one
entered
the
ferragus
rose
to
go
do
you
know
this
man
asked
monsieur
de
maulincour
of
the
seizing
ferragus
by
the
collar
but
ferragus
quickly
disengaged
himself
took
monsieur
de
maulincour
by
the
hair
and
shook
his
head
rapidly
must
you
have
lead
in
it
to
make
it
steady
he
said
i
do
not
know
him
personally
replied
henri
de
marsay
the
spectator
of
this
scene
but
i
know
that
he
is
monsieur
de
funcal
a
rich
monsieur
de
funcal
had
disappeared
the
baron
followed
but
without
being
able
to
overtake
him
until
he
reached
the
peristyle
where
he
saw
ferragus
who
looked
at
him
with
a
jeering
laugh
from
a
brilliant
equipage
which
was
driven
away
at
high
speed
monsieur
said
auguste
the
salon
and
addressing
de
marsay
whom
he
knew
i
entreat
you
to
tell
me
where
monsieur
de
funcal
i
do
not
know
but
some
one
here
can
no
doubt
tell
the
baron
having
questioned
the
prefect
ascertained
that
the
comte
de
funcal
lived
at
the
portuguese
embassy
at
this
moment
while
he
still
felt
the
icy
fingers
of
that
strange
man
in
his
hair
he
saw
madame
jules
in
all
her
dazzling
beauty
fresh
gracious
artless
resplendent
with
the
sanctity
of
womanhood
which
had
won
his
love
this
creature
now
infernal
to
him
excited
no
emotion
in
his
soul
but
that
of
hatred
and
this
hatred
shone
in
a
savage
terrible
look
from
his
eyes
he
watched
for
a
moment
when
he
could
speak
to
her
unheard
and
then
he
said
madame
your
have
missed
me
three
what
do
you
mean
monsieur
she
said
flushing
i
know
that
you
have
had
several
unfortunate
accidents
lately
which
i
have
greatly
regretted
but
how
could
i
have
had
anything
to
do
with
them
you
knew
that
were
employed
against
me
by
that
man
of
the
rue
soly
monsieur
madame
i
now
call
you
to
account
not
for
my
happiness
only
but
for
my
blood
at
this
instant
jules
desmarets
approached
them
what
are
you
saying
to
my
wife
monsieur
make
that
inquiry
at
my
own
house
monsieur
if
you
are
curious
said
maulincour
moving
away
and
leaving
madame
jules
in
an
almost
fainting
condition
there
are
few
women
who
have
not
found
themselves
once
at
least
in
their
lives
of
some
undeniable
fact
confronted
with
a
direct
sharp
uncompromising
question
one
of
those
questions
pitilessly
asked
by
husbands
the
mere
apprehension
of
which
gives
a
chill
while
the
actual
words
enter
the
heart
like
the
blade
of
a
dagger
it
is
from
such
crises
that
the
maxim
has
come
all
women
falsehood
kindly
falsehood
venial
falsehood
sublime
falsehood
horrible
falsehood
but
always
the
necessity
to
lie
this
necessity
admitted
ought
they
not
to
know
how
to
lie
well
french
women
do
it
admirably
our
manners
and
customs
teach
them
deception
besides
women
are
so
naively
saucy
so
pretty
graceful
and
withal
so
true
in
lying
they
recognize
so
fully
the
utility
of
doing
so
in
order
to
avoid
in
social
life
the
violent
shocks
which
happiness
might
not
resist
that
lying
is
seen
to
be
as
necessary
to
their
lives
as
the
in
which
they
put
away
their
jewels
falsehood
becomes
to
them
the
foundation
of
speech
truth
is
exceptional
they
tell
it
if
they
are
virtuous
by
caprice
or
by
calculation
according
to
individual
character
some
women
laugh
when
they
lie
others
weep
others
are
grave
some
grow
angry
after
beginning
life
by
feigning
indifference
to
the
homage
that
deeply
flatters
them
they
often
end
by
lying
to
themselves
who
has
not
admired
their
apparent
superiority
to
everything
at
the
very
moment
when
they
are
trembling
for
the
secret
treasures
of
their
love
who
has
never
studied
their
ease
their
readiness
their
freedom
of
mind
in
the
greatest
embarrassments
of
life
in
them
nothing
is
put
on
deception
comes
as
the
snow
from
heaven
and
then
with
what
art
they
discover
the
truth
in
others
with
what
shrewdness
they
employ
a
direct
logic
in
answer
to
some
passionate
question
which
has
revealed
to
them
the
secret
of
the
heart
of
a
man
who
was
guileless
enough
to
proceed
by
questioning
to
question
a
woman
why
that
is
delivering
one
s
self
up
to
her
does
she
not
learn
in
that
way
all
that
we
seek
to
hide
from
her
does
she
not
know
also
how
to
be
dumb
through
speaking
what
men
are
daring
enough
to
struggle
with
the
parisian
woman
a
woman
who
knows
how
to
hold
herself
above
all
dagger
thrusts
saying
you
are
very
inquisitive
what
is
it
to
you
why
do
you
wish
to
know
ah
you
are
jealous
and
suppose
i
do
not
choose
to
answer
you
in
short
a
woman
who
possesses
the
hundred
and
methods
of
saying
and
incommensurable
variations
of
the
word
is
not
a
treatise
on
the
words
and
a
fine
diplomatic
philosophic
logographic
and
moral
work
still
waiting
to
be
written
but
to
accomplish
this
work
which
we
may
also
call
diabolic
isn
t
an
androgynous
genius
necessary
for
that
reason
probably
it
will
never
be
attempted
and
besides
of
all
unpublished
works
isn
t
it
the
best
known
and
the
best
practised
among
women
have
you
studied
the
behavior
the
pose
the
of
a
falsehood
examine
it
madame
desmarets
was
seated
in
the
corner
of
her
carriage
her
husband
in
the
left
having
forced
herself
to
recover
from
her
emotion
in
the
ballroom
she
now
affected
a
calm
demeanor
her
husband
had
then
said
nothing
to
her
and
he
still
said
nothing
jules
looked
out
of
the
carriage
window
at
the
black
walls
of
the
silent
houses
before
which
they
passed
but
suddenly
as
if
driven
by
a
determining
thought
when
turning
the
corner
of
a
street
he
examined
his
wife
who
appeared
to
be
cold
in
spite
of
the
pelisse
in
which
she
was
wrapped
he
thought
she
seemed
pensive
and
perhaps
she
really
was
so
of
all
communicable
things
reflection
and
gravity
are
the
most
contagious
what
could
monsieur
de
maulincour
have
said
to
affect
you
so
keenly
said
jules
and
why
does
he
wish
me
to
go
to
his
house
and
find
out
he
can
tell
you
nothing
in
his
house
that
i
can
not
tell
you
here
she
replied
then
with
that
feminine
craft
which
always
slightly
degrades
virtue
madame
jules
waited
for
another
question
her
husband
turned
his
face
back
to
the
houses
and
continued
his
study
of
their
walls
another
question
would
imply
suspicion
distrust
to
suspect
a
woman
is
a
crime
in
love
jules
had
already
killed
a
man
for
doubting
his
wife
clemence
did
not
know
all
there
was
of
true
passion
of
loyal
reflection
in
her
husband
s
silence
just
as
jules
was
ignorant
of
the
generous
drama
that
was
wringing
the
heart
of
his
clemence
the
carriage
rolled
on
through
a
silent
paris
bearing
the
couple
two
lovers
who
adored
each
other
and
who
gently
leaning
on
the
same
silken
cushion
were
being
parted
by
an
abyss
in
these
elegant
coupes
returning
from
a
ball
between
midnight
and
two
in
the
morning
how
many
curious
and
singular
scenes
must
pass
meaning
those
coupes
with
lanterns
which
light
both
the
street
and
the
carriage
those
with
their
windows
unshaded
in
short
legitimate
coupes
in
which
couples
can
quarrel
without
caring
for
the
eyes
of
pedestrians
because
the
civil
code
gives
a
right
to
provoke
or
beat
or
kiss
a
wife
in
a
carriage
or
elsewhere
anywhere
everywhere
how
many
secrets
must
be
revealed
in
this
way
to
nocturnal
pedestrians
to
those
young
fellows
who
have
gone
to
a
ball
in
a
carriage
but
are
obliged
for
whatever
cause
it
may
be
to
return
on
foot
it
was
the
first
time
that
jules
and
clemence
had
been
together
thus
each
in
a
corner
usually
the
husband
pressed
close
to
his
wife
it
is
very
cold
remarked
madame
jules
but
her
husband
did
not
hear
her
he
was
studying
the
signs
above
the
shop
windows
clemence
he
said
at
last
forgive
me
the
question
i
am
about
to
ask
he
came
closer
took
her
by
the
waist
and
drew
her
to
him
my
god
it
is
coming
thought
the
poor
woman
well
she
said
aloud
anticipating
the
question
you
want
to
know
what
monsieur
de
maulincour
said
to
me
i
will
tell
you
jules
but
not
without
fear
good
god
how
is
it
possible
that
you
and
i
should
have
secrets
from
one
another
for
the
last
few
moments
i
have
seen
you
struggling
between
a
conviction
of
our
love
and
vague
fears
but
that
conviction
is
clear
within
us
is
it
not
and
these
doubts
and
fears
do
they
not
seem
to
you
dark
and
unnatural
why
not
stay
in
that
clear
light
of
love
you
can
not
doubt
when
i
have
told
you
all
you
will
still
desire
to
know
more
and
yet
i
myself
do
not
know
what
the
extraordinary
words
of
that
man
meant
what
i
fear
is
that
this
may
lead
to
some
fatal
affair
between
you
i
would
rather
that
we
both
forget
this
unpleasant
moment
but
in
any
case
swear
to
me
that
you
will
let
this
singular
adventure
explain
itself
naturally
here
are
the
facts
monsieur
de
maulincour
declared
to
me
that
the
three
accidents
you
have
heard
mentioned
the
falling
of
a
stone
on
his
servant
the
breaking
down
of
his
cabriolet
and
his
duel
about
madame
de
serizy
were
the
result
of
some
plot
i
had
laid
against
him
he
also
threatened
to
reveal
to
you
the
cause
of
my
desire
to
destroy
him
can
you
imagine
what
all
this
means
my
emotion
came
from
the
sight
of
his
face
convulsed
with
madness
his
haggard
eyes
and
also
his
words
broken
by
some
violent
inward
emotion
i
thought
him
mad
that
is
all
that
took
place
now
i
should
be
less
than
a
woman
if
i
had
not
perceived
that
for
over
a
year
i
have
become
as
they
call
it
the
passion
of
monsieur
de
maulincour
he
has
never
seen
me
except
at
a
ball
and
our
intercourse
has
been
most
insignificant
merely
that
which
every
one
shares
at
a
ball
perhaps
he
wants
to
disunite
us
so
that
he
may
find
me
at
some
future
time
alone
and
unprotected
there
see
already
you
are
frowning
oh
how
cordially
i
hate
society
we
were
so
happy
without
him
why
take
any
notice
of
him
jules
i
entreat
you
forget
all
this
we
shall
no
doubt
hear
that
monsieur
de
maulincour
has
gone
what
a
singular
affair
thought
jules
as
the
carriage
stopped
under
the
peristyle
of
their
house
he
gave
his
arm
to
his
wife
and
together
they
went
up
to
their
apartments
to
develop
this
history
in
all
its
truth
of
detail
and
to
follow
its
course
through
many
windings
it
is
necessary
here
to
divulge
some
of
love
s
secrets
to
glide
beneath
the
ceilings
of
a
marriage
chamber
not
shamelessly
but
like
trilby
frightening
neither
dougal
nor
jeannie
alarming
no
one
being
as
chaste
as
our
noble
french
language
requires
and
as
bold
as
the
pencil
of
gerard
in
his
picture
of
daphnis
and
chloe
the
bedroom
of
madame
jules
was
a
sacred
plot
herself
her
husband
and
her
maid
alone
entered
it
opulence
has
glorious
privileges
and
the
most
enviable
are
those
which
enable
the
development
of
sentiments
to
their
fullest
extent
fertilizing
them
by
the
accomplishment
of
even
their
caprices
and
surrounding
them
with
a
brilliancy
that
enlarges
them
with
refinements
that
purify
them
with
a
thousand
delicacies
that
make
them
still
more
alluring
if
you
hate
dinners
on
the
grass
and
meals
if
you
feel
a
pleasure
in
seeing
a
damask
cloth
that
is
dazzlingly
white
a
dinner
service
and
porcelain
of
exquisite
purity
lighted
by
transparent
candles
where
miracles
of
cookery
are
served
under
silver
covers
bearing
coats
of
arms
you
must
to
be
consistent
leave
the
garrets
at
the
tops
of
the
houses
and
the
grisettes
in
the
streets
abandon
garrets
grisettes
umbrellas
and
overshoes
to
men
who
pay
for
their
dinners
with
tickets
and
you
must
also
comprehend
love
to
be
a
principle
which
develops
in
all
its
grace
only
on
savonnerie
carpets
beneath
the
opal
gleams
of
an
alabaster
lamp
between
guarded
walls
before
gilded
hearths
in
chambers
deadened
to
all
outward
sounds
by
shutters
and
billowy
curtains
mirrors
must
be
there
to
show
the
play
of
form
and
repeat
the
woman
we
would
multiply
as
love
itself
multiplies
and
magnifies
her
next
low
divans
and
a
bed
which
like
a
secret
is
divined
not
shown
in
this
coquettish
chamber
are
slippers
for
pretty
feet
under
glass
with
muslin
draperies
by
which
to
read
at
all
hours
of
the
night
and
flowers
not
those
oppressive
to
the
head
and
linen
the
fineness
of
which
might
have
satisfied
anne
of
austria
madame
jules
had
realized
this
charming
programme
but
that
was
nothing
all
women
of
taste
can
do
as
much
though
there
is
always
in
the
arrangement
of
these
details
a
stamp
of
personality
which
gives
to
this
decoration
or
that
detail
a
character
that
can
not
be
imitated
more
than
ever
reigns
the
fanaticism
of
individuality
the
more
our
laws
tend
to
an
impossible
equality
the
more
we
shall
get
away
from
it
in
our
manners
and
customs
thus
rich
people
are
beginning
in
france
to
become
more
exclusive
in
their
tastes
and
their
belongings
than
they
have
been
for
the
last
thirty
years
madame
jules
knew
very
well
how
to
carry
out
this
programme
and
everything
about
her
was
arranged
in
harmony
with
a
luxury
that
suits
so
well
with
love
love
in
a
cottage
or
fifteen
hundred
francs
and
my
sophy
is
the
dream
of
starvelings
to
whom
black
bread
suffices
in
their
present
state
but
when
love
really
comes
they
grow
fastidious
and
end
by
craving
the
luxuries
of
gastronomy
love
holds
toil
and
poverty
in
horror
it
would
rather
die
than
merely
live
on
from
hand
to
mouth
many
women
returning
from
a
ball
impatient
for
their
beds
throw
off
their
gowns
their
faded
flowers
their
bouquets
the
fragrance
of
which
has
now
departed
they
leave
their
little
shoes
beneath
a
chair
the
white
strings
trailing
they
take
out
their
combs
and
let
their
hair
roll
down
as
it
will
little
they
care
if
their
husbands
see
the
puffs
the
hairpins
the
artful
props
which
supported
the
elegant
edifices
of
the
hair
and
the
garlands
or
the
jewels
that
adorned
it
no
more
mysteries
all
is
over
for
the
husband
no
more
painting
or
decoration
for
him
the
corset
half
the
time
it
is
a
corset
of
a
reparative
kind
lies
where
it
is
thrown
if
the
maid
is
too
sleepy
to
take
it
away
with
her
the
whalebone
bustle
the
protections
round
the
sleeves
the
pads
the
hair
bought
from
a
coiffeur
all
the
false
woman
is
there
scattered
about
in
open
sight
membra
the
artificial
poesy
so
much
admired
by
those
for
whom
it
is
conceived
and
elaborated
the
fragments
of
a
pretty
woman
litter
every
corner
of
the
room
to
the
love
of
a
yawning
husband
the
actual
presents
herself
also
yawning
in
a
dishabille
without
elegance
and
a
tumbled
that
of
last
night
and
that
of
night
also
for
really
monsieur
if
you
want
a
pretty
cap
to
rumple
every
night
increase
my
there
s
life
as
it
is
a
woman
makes
herself
old
and
unpleasing
to
her
husband
but
dainty
and
elegant
and
adorned
for
others
for
the
rival
of
all
husbands
for
that
world
which
calumniates
and
tears
to
shreds
her
sex
inspired
by
true
love
for
love
has
like
other
creations
its
instinct
of
preservation
madame
jules
did
very
differently
she
found
in
the
constant
blessing
of
her
love
the
necessary
impulse
to
fulfil
all
those
minute
personal
cares
which
ought
never
to
be
relaxed
because
they
perpetuate
love
besides
such
personal
cares
and
duties
proceed
from
a
personal
dignity
which
becomes
all
women
and
are
among
the
sweetest
of
flatteries
for
is
it
not
respecting
in
themselves
the
man
they
love
so
madame
jules
denied
to
her
husband
all
access
to
her
where
she
left
the
accessories
of
her
toilet
and
whence
she
issued
mysteriously
adorned
for
the
mysterious
fetes
of
her
heart
entering
their
chamber
which
was
always
graceful
and
elegant
jules
found
a
woman
coquettishly
wrapped
in
a
charming
her
hair
simply
wound
in
heavy
coils
around
her
head
a
woman
always
more
simple
more
beautiful
there
than
she
was
before
the
world
a
woman
just
refreshed
in
water
whose
only
artifice
consisted
in
being
whiter
than
her
muslins
sweeter
than
all
perfumes
more
seductive
than
any
siren
always
loving
and
therefore
always
loved
this
admirable
understanding
of
a
wife
s
business
was
the
secret
of
josephine
s
charm
for
napoleon
as
in
former
times
it
was
that
of
caesonia
for
caius
caligula
of
diane
de
poitiers
for
henri
ii
if
it
was
largely
productive
to
women
of
seven
or
eight
lustres
what
a
weapon
is
it
in
the
hands
of
young
women
a
husband
gathers
with
delight
the
rewards
of
his
fidelity
returning
home
after
the
conversation
which
had
chilled
her
with
fear
and
still
gave
her
the
keenest
anxiety
madame
jules
took
particular
pains
with
her
toilet
for
the
night
she
wanted
to
make
herself
and
she
did
make
herself
enchanting
she
belted
the
cambric
of
her
round
her
waist
defining
the
lines
of
her
bust
she
allowed
her
hair
to
fall
upon
her
beautifully
modelled
shoulders
a
perfumed
bath
had
given
her
a
delightful
fragrance
and
her
little
bare
feet
were
in
velvet
slippers
strong
in
a
sense
of
her
advantages
she
came
in
stepping
softly
and
put
her
hands
over
her
husband
s
eyes
she
thought
him
pensive
he
was
standing
in
his
before
the
fire
his
elbow
on
the
mantel
and
one
foot
on
the
fender
she
said
in
his
ear
warming
it
with
her
breath
and
nibbling
the
tip
of
it
with
her
teeth
what
are
you
thinking
about
monsieur
then
she
pressed
him
in
her
arms
as
if
to
tear
him
away
from
all
evil
thoughts
the
woman
who
loves
has
a
full
knowledge
of
her
power
the
more
virtuous
she
is
the
more
effectual
her
coquetry
about
you
he
answered
only
about
me
ah
that
s
a
very
doubtful
they
went
to
bed
as
she
fell
asleep
madame
jules
said
to
herself
monsieur
de
maulincour
will
certainly
cause
some
evil
jules
mind
is
preoccupied
disturbed
he
is
nursing
thoughts
he
does
not
tell
it
was
three
in
the
morning
when
madame
jules
was
awakened
by
a
presentiment
which
struck
her
heart
as
she
slept
she
had
a
sense
both
physical
and
moral
of
her
husband
s
absence
she
did
not
feel
the
arm
jules
passed
beneath
her
head
that
arm
in
which
she
had
slept
peacefully
and
happy
for
five
years
an
arm
she
had
never
wearied
a
voice
said
to
her
jules
suffers
jules
is
she
raised
her
head
and
then
sat
up
felt
that
her
husband
s
place
was
cold
and
saw
him
sitting
before
the
fire
his
feet
on
the
fender
his
head
resting
against
the
back
of
an
tears
were
on
his
cheeks
the
poor
woman
threw
herself
hastily
from
her
bed
and
sprang
at
a
bound
to
her
husband
s
knees
jules
what
is
it
are
you
ill
speak
tell
me
speak
to
me
if
you
love
me
and
she
poured
out
a
hundred
words
expressing
the
deepest
tenderness
jules
knelt
at
her
feet
kissed
her
hands
and
knees
and
answered
with
fresh
tears
dear
clemence
i
am
most
unhappy
it
is
not
loving
to
distrust
the
one
we
love
i
adore
you
and
suspect
you
the
words
that
man
said
to
me
have
struck
to
my
heart
they
stay
there
in
spite
of
myself
and
confound
me
there
is
some
mystery
here
in
short
and
i
blush
to
say
it
your
explanations
do
not
satisfy
me
my
reason
casts
gleams
into
my
soul
which
my
love
rejects
it
is
an
awful
combat
could
i
stay
there
holding
your
head
and
suspecting
thoughts
within
it
to
me
unknown
oh
i
believe
in
you
i
believe
in
you
he
cried
seeing
her
smile
sadly
and
open
her
mouth
as
if
to
speak
say
nothing
do
not
reproach
me
besides
could
you
say
anything
i
have
not
said
myself
for
the
last
three
hours
yes
for
three
hours
i
have
been
here
watching
you
as
you
slept
so
beautiful
admiring
that
pure
peaceful
brow
yes
yes
you
have
always
told
me
your
thoughts
have
you
not
i
alone
am
in
that
soul
while
i
look
at
you
while
my
eyes
can
plunge
into
yours
i
see
all
plainly
your
life
is
as
pure
as
your
glance
is
clear
no
there
is
no
secret
behind
those
transparent
he
rose
and
kissed
their
lids
let
me
avow
to
you
dearest
soul
he
said
that
for
the
last
five
years
each
day
has
increased
my
happiness
through
the
knowledge
that
you
are
all
mine
and
that
no
natural
affection
even
can
take
any
of
your
love
having
no
sister
no
father
no
mother
no
companion
i
am
neither
above
nor
below
any
living
being
in
your
heart
i
am
alone
there
clemence
repeat
to
me
those
sweet
things
of
the
spirit
you
have
so
often
said
to
me
do
not
blame
me
comfort
me
i
am
so
unhappy
i
have
an
odious
suspicion
on
my
conscience
and
you
have
nothing
in
your
heart
to
sear
it
my
beloved
tell
me
could
i
stay
there
beside
you
could
two
heads
united
as
ours
have
been
lie
on
the
same
pillow
when
one
was
suffering
and
the
other
tranquil
what
are
you
thinking
of
he
cried
abruptly
observing
that
clemence
was
anxious
confused
and
seemed
unable
to
restrain
her
tears
i
am
thinking
of
my
mother
she
answered
in
a
grave
voice
you
will
never
know
jules
what
i
suffer
in
remembering
my
mother
s
dying
farewell
said
in
a
voice
sweeter
than
all
music
and
in
feeling
the
solemn
touch
of
her
icy
hand
at
a
moment
when
you
overwhelm
me
with
those
assurances
of
your
precious
she
raised
her
husband
strained
him
to
her
with
a
nervous
force
greater
than
that
of
men
and
kissed
his
hair
covering
it
with
tears
ah
i
would
be
hacked
in
pieces
for
you
tell
me
that
i
make
you
happy
that
i
am
to
you
the
most
beautiful
of
women
a
thousand
women
to
you
oh
you
are
loved
as
no
other
man
ever
was
or
will
be
i
don
t
know
the
meaning
of
those
words
duty
jules
i
love
you
for
yourself
i
am
happy
in
loving
you
i
shall
love
you
more
and
more
to
my
dying
day
i
have
pride
in
my
love
i
feel
it
is
my
destiny
to
have
one
sole
emotion
in
my
life
what
i
shall
tell
you
now
is
dreadful
i
know
but
i
am
glad
to
have
no
child
i
do
not
wish
for
any
i
feel
i
am
more
wife
than
mother
well
then
can
you
fear
listen
to
me
my
own
beloved
promise
to
forget
not
this
hour
of
mingled
tenderness
and
doubt
but
the
words
of
that
madman
jules
you
promise
me
not
to
see
him
not
to
go
to
him
i
have
a
deep
conviction
that
if
you
set
one
foot
in
that
maze
we
shall
both
roll
down
a
precipice
where
i
shall
perish
but
with
your
name
upon
my
lips
your
heart
in
my
heart
why
hold
me
so
high
in
that
heart
and
yet
so
low
in
reality
what
you
who
give
credit
to
so
many
as
to
money
can
you
not
give
me
the
charity
of
faith
and
on
the
first
occasion
in
our
lives
when
you
might
prove
to
me
your
boundless
trust
do
you
cast
me
from
my
throne
in
your
heart
between
a
madman
and
me
it
is
the
madman
whom
you
choose
to
believe
oh
jules
she
stopped
threw
back
the
hair
that
fell
about
her
brow
and
neck
and
then
in
a
tone
she
added
i
have
said
too
much
one
word
should
suffice
if
your
soul
and
your
forehead
still
keep
this
cloud
however
light
it
be
i
tell
you
now
that
i
shall
die
of
she
could
not
repress
a
shudder
and
turned
pale
oh
i
will
kill
that
man
thought
jules
as
he
lifted
his
wife
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
her
bed
let
us
sleep
in
peace
my
angel
he
said
i
have
forgotten
all
i
swear
it
clemence
fell
asleep
to
the
music
of
those
sweet
words
softly
repeated
jules
as
he
watched
her
sleeping
said
in
his
heart
she
is
right
when
love
is
so
pure
suspicion
blights
it
to
that
young
soul
that
tender
flower
a
blight
yes
a
blight
means
when
a
cloud
comes
between
two
beings
filled
with
affection
for
each
other
and
whose
lives
are
in
absolute
unison
that
cloud
though
it
may
disperse
leaves
in
those
souls
a
trace
of
its
passage
either
love
gains
a
stronger
life
as
the
earth
after
rain
or
the
shock
still
echoes
like
distant
thunder
through
a
cloudless
sky
it
is
impossible
to
recover
absolutely
the
former
life
love
will
either
increase
or
diminish
at
breakfast
monsieur
and
madame
jules
showed
to
each
other
those
particular
attentions
in
which
there
is
always
something
of
affectation
there
were
glances
of
forced
gaiety
which
seemed
the
efforts
of
persons
endeavoring
to
deceive
themselves
jules
had
involuntary
doubts
his
wife
had
positive
fears
still
sure
of
each
other
they
had
slept
was
this
strained
condition
the
effect
of
a
want
of
faith
or
was
it
only
a
memory
of
their
nocturnal
scene
they
did
not
know
themselves
but
they
loved
each
other
so
purely
that
the
impression
of
that
scene
both
cruel
and
beneficent
could
not
fail
to
leave
its
traces
in
their
souls
both
were
eager
to
make
those
traces
disappear
each
striving
to
be
the
first
to
return
to
the
other
and
thus
they
could
not
fail
to
think
of
the
cause
of
their
first
variance
to
loving
souls
this
is
not
grief
pain
is
still
but
it
is
a
sort
of
mourning
which
is
difficult
to
depict
if
there
are
indeed
relations
between
colors
and
the
emotions
of
the
soul
if
as
locke
s
blind
man
said
scarlet
produces
on
the
sight
the
effect
produced
upon
the
hearing
by
a
blast
of
trumpets
it
is
permissible
to
compare
this
reaction
of
melancholy
to
mourning
tones
of
gray
but
even
so
love
saddened
love
in
which
remains
a
true
sentiment
of
its
happiness
momentarily
troubled
though
it
be
gives
enjoyments
derived
from
pain
and
pleasure
both
which
are
all
novel
jules
studied
his
wife
s
voice
he
watched
her
glances
with
the
freshness
of
feeling
that
inspired
him
in
the
earliest
days
of
his
passion
for
her
the
memory
of
five
absolutely
happy
years
her
beauty
the
candor
of
her
love
quickly
effaced
in
her
husband
s
mind
the
last
vestiges
of
an
intolerable
pain
the
day
was
sunday
a
day
on
which
there
was
no
bourse
and
no
business
to
be
done
the
reunited
pair
passed
the
whole
day
together
getting
farther
into
each
other
s
hearts
than
they
ever
yet
had
done
like
two
children
who
in
a
moment
of
fear
hold
each
other
closely
and
cling
together
united
by
an
instinct
there
are
in
this
life
of
completely
happy
days
the
gift
of
chance
ephemeral
flowers
born
neither
of
yesterday
nor
belonging
to
the
morrow
jules
and
clemence
now
enjoyed
this
day
as
though
they
forboded
it
to
be
the
last
of
their
loving
life
what
name
shall
we
give
to
that
mysterious
power
which
hastens
the
steps
of
travellers
before
the
storm
is
visible
which
makes
the
life
and
beauty
of
the
dying
so
resplendent
and
fills
the
parting
soul
with
joyous
projects
for
days
before
death
comes
which
tells
the
midnight
student
to
fill
his
lamp
when
it
shines
brightest
and
makes
the
mother
fear
the
thoughtful
look
cast
upon
her
infant
by
an
observing
man
we
all
are
affected
by
this
influence
in
the
great
catastrophes
of
life
but
it
has
never
yet
been
named
or
studied
it
is
something
more
than
presentiment
but
not
as
yet
clear
vision
all
went
well
till
the
following
day
on
monday
jules
desmarets
obliged
to
go
to
the
bourse
on
his
usual
business
asked
his
wife
as
usual
if
she
would
take
advantage
of
his
carriage
and
let
him
drive
her
anywhere
no
she
said
the
day
is
too
unpleasant
to
go
it
was
raining
in
torrents
at
two
o
clock
monsieur
desmarets
reached
the
treasury
at
four
o
clock
as
he
left
the
bourse
he
came
face
to
face
with
monsieur
de
maulincour
who
was
waiting
for
him
with
the
nervous
pertinacity
of
hatred
and
vengeance
monsieur
he
said
taking
monsieur
desmarets
by
the
arm
i
have
important
information
to
give
you
listen
to
me
i
am
too
loyal
a
man
to
have
recourse
to
anonymous
letters
with
which
to
trouble
your
peace
of
mind
i
prefer
to
speak
to
you
in
person
believe
me
if
my
very
life
were
not
concerned
i
should
not
meddle
with
the
private
affairs
of
any
household
even
if
i
thought
i
had
the
right
to
do
if
what
you
have
to
say
to
me
concerns
madame
desmarets
replied
jules
i
request
you
to
be
silent
if
i
am
silent
monsieur
you
may
before
long
see
madame
jules
on
the
prisoner
s
bench
at
the
court
of
assizes
beside
a
convict
now
do
you
wish
me
to
be
silent
jules
turned
pale
but
his
noble
face
instantly
resumed
its
calmness
though
it
was
now
a
false
calmness
drawing
the
baron
under
one
of
the
temporary
sheds
of
the
bourse
near
which
they
were
standing
he
said
to
him
in
a
voice
which
concealed
his
intense
inward
emotion
monsieur
i
will
listen
to
you
but
there
will
be
a
duel
to
the
death
between
us
if
oh
to
that
i
consent
cried
monsieur
de
maulincour
i
have
the
greatest
esteem
for
your
character
you
speak
of
death
you
are
unaware
that
your
wife
may
have
assisted
in
poisoning
me
last
saturday
night
yes
monsieur
since
then
some
extraordinary
evil
has
developed
in
me
my
hair
appears
to
distil
an
inward
fever
and
a
deadly
languor
through
my
skull
i
know
who
clutched
my
hair
at
that
monsieur
de
maulincour
then
related
without
omitting
a
single
fact
his
platonic
love
for
madame
jules
and
the
details
of
the
affair
in
the
rue
soly
which
began
this
narrative
any
one
would
have
listened
to
him
with
attention
but
madame
jules
husband
had
good
reason
to
be
more
amazed
than
any
other
human
being
here
his
character
displayed
itself
he
was
more
amazed
than
overcome
made
a
judge
and
the
judge
of
an
adored
woman
he
found
in
his
soul
the
equity
of
a
judge
as
well
as
the
inflexibility
a
lover
still
he
thought
less
of
his
own
shattered
life
than
of
his
wife
s
life
he
listened
not
to
his
own
anguish
but
to
some
voice
that
cried
to
him
clemence
can
not
lie
why
should
she
betray
you
monsieur
said
the
baron
as
he
ended
being
absolutely
certain
of
having
recognized
in
monsieur
de
funcal
the
same
ferragus
whom
the
police
declared
dead
i
have
put
upon
his
traces
an
intelligent
man
as
i
returned
that
night
i
remembered
by
a
fortunate
chance
the
name
of
madame
meynardie
mentioned
in
that
letter
of
ida
the
presumed
mistress
of
my
persecutor
supplied
with
this
clue
my
emissary
will
soon
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
horrible
affair
for
he
is
far
more
able
to
discover
the
truth
than
the
police
monsieur
replied
desmarets
i
know
not
how
to
thank
you
for
this
confidence
you
say
that
you
can
obtain
proofs
and
witnesses
i
shall
await
them
i
shall
seek
the
truth
of
this
strange
affair
courageously
but
you
must
permit
me
to
doubt
everything
until
the
evidence
of
the
facts
you
state
is
proved
to
me
in
any
case
you
shall
have
satisfaction
for
as
you
will
certainly
understand
we
both
require
jules
returned
home
what
is
the
matter
jules
asked
his
wife
when
she
saw
him
you
look
so
pale
you
frighten
me
the
day
is
cold
he
answered
walking
with
slow
steps
across
the
room
where
all
things
spoke
to
him
of
love
and
happiness
that
room
so
calm
and
peaceful
where
a
deadly
storm
was
gathering
did
you
go
out
he
asked
as
though
mechanically
he
was
impelled
to
ask
the
question
by
the
last
of
a
myriad
of
thoughts
which
had
gathered
themselves
together
into
a
lucid
meditation
though
jealousy
was
actively
prompting
them
no
she
answered
in
a
tone
that
was
falsely
candid
at
that
instant
jules
saw
through
the
open
door
of
the
the
velvet
bonnet
which
his
wife
wore
in
the
mornings
on
it
were
drops
of
rain
jules
was
a
passionate
man
but
he
was
also
full
of
delicacy
it
was
repugnant
to
him
to
bring
his
wife
face
to
face
with
a
lie
when
such
a
situation
occurs
all
has
come
to
an
end
forever
between
certain
beings
and
yet
those
drops
of
rain
were
like
a
flash
tearing
through
his
brain
he
left
the
room
went
down
to
the
porter
s
lodge
and
said
to
the
porter
after
making
sure
that
they
were
alone
fouguereau
a
hundred
crowns
if
you
tell
me
the
truth
dismissal
if
you
deceive
me
and
nothing
at
all
if
you
ever
speak
of
my
question
and
your
he
stopped
to
examine
the
man
s
face
leading
him
under
the
window
then
he
continued
did
madame
go
out
this
morning
madame
went
out
at
a
quarter
to
three
and
i
think
i
saw
her
come
in
about
half
an
hour
that
is
true
upon
your
honor
yes
you
will
have
the
money
but
if
you
speak
of
this
remember
you
will
lose
jules
returned
to
his
wife
clemence
he
said
i
find
i
must
put
my
accounts
in
order
do
not
be
offended
at
the
inquiry
i
am
going
to
make
have
i
not
given
you
forty
thousand
francs
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
more
she
said
have
you
spent
them
nearly
she
replied
in
the
first
place
i
had
to
pay
several
of
our
last
year
s
bills
i
shall
never
find
out
anything
in
this
way
thought
jules
i
am
not
taking
the
best
at
this
moment
jules
own
valet
entered
the
room
with
a
letter
for
his
master
who
opened
it
indifferently
but
as
soon
as
his
eyes
had
lighted
on
the
signature
he
read
it
eagerly
the
letter
was
as
follows
monsieur
for
the
sake
of
your
peace
of
mind
as
well
as
ours
i
take
the
course
of
writing
you
this
letter
without
possessing
the
advantage
of
being
known
to
you
but
my
position
my
age
and
the
fear
of
some
misfortune
compel
me
to
entreat
you
to
show
indulgence
in
the
trying
circumstances
under
which
our
afflicted
family
is
placed
monsieur
auguste
de
maulincour
has
for
the
last
few
days
shown
signs
of
mental
derangement
and
we
fear
that
he
may
trouble
your
happiness
by
fancies
which
he
confided
to
monsieur
le
vidame
de
pamiers
and
myself
during
his
first
attack
of
frenzy
we
think
it
right
therefore
to
warn
you
of
his
malady
which
is
we
hope
curable
but
it
will
have
such
serious
and
important
effects
on
the
honor
of
our
family
and
the
career
of
my
grandson
that
we
must
rely
monsieur
on
your
entire
discretion
if
monsieur
le
vidame
or
i
could
have
gone
to
see
you
we
would
not
have
written
but
i
make
no
doubt
that
you
will
regard
this
prayer
of
a
mother
who
begs
you
to
destroy
this
letter
accept
the
assurance
of
my
perfect
consideration
baronne
de
maulincour
de
rieux
oh
what
torture
cried
jules
what
is
it
what
is
in
your
mind
asked
his
wife
exhibiting
the
deepest
anxiety
i
have
come
he
answered
slowly
as
he
threw
her
the
letter
to
ask
myself
whether
it
can
be
you
who
have
sent
me
that
to
avert
my
suspicions
judge
therefore
what
i
unhappy
man
said
madame
jules
letting
fall
the
paper
i
pity
him
though
he
has
done
me
great
are
you
aware
that
he
has
spoken
to
me
oh
have
you
been
to
see
him
in
spite
of
your
promise
she
cried
in
terror
clemence
our
love
is
in
danger
of
perishing
we
stand
outside
of
the
ordinary
rules
of
life
let
us
lay
aside
all
petty
considerations
in
presence
of
this
great
peril
explain
to
me
why
you
went
out
this
morning
women
think
they
have
the
right
to
tell
us
little
falsehoods
sometimes
they
like
to
hide
a
pleasure
they
are
preparing
for
us
just
now
you
said
a
word
to
me
by
mistake
no
doubt
a
no
for
a
he
went
into
the
and
brought
out
the
bonnet
see
he
said
your
bonnet
has
betrayed
you
these
spots
are
raindrops
you
must
therefore
have
gone
out
in
a
street
cab
and
these
drops
fell
upon
it
as
you
went
to
find
one
or
as
you
entered
or
left
the
house
where
you
went
but
a
woman
can
leave
her
own
home
for
many
innocent
purposes
even
after
she
has
told
her
husband
that
she
did
not
mean
to
go
out
there
are
so
many
reasons
for
changing
our
plans
caprices
whims
are
they
not
your
right
women
are
not
required
to
be
consistent
with
themselves
you
had
forgotten
something
a
service
to
render
a
visit
some
kind
action
but
nothing
hinders
a
woman
from
telling
her
husband
what
she
does
can
we
ever
blush
on
the
breast
of
a
friend
it
is
not
a
jealous
husband
who
speaks
to
you
my
clemence
it
is
your
lover
your
friend
your
he
flung
himself
passionately
at
her
feet
speak
not
to
justify
yourself
but
to
calm
my
horrible
sufferings
i
know
that
you
went
out
well
what
did
you
do
where
did
you
go
yes
i
went
out
jules
she
answered
in
a
strained
voice
though
her
face
was
calm
but
ask
me
nothing
more
wait
have
confidence
without
which
you
will
lay
up
for
yourself
terrible
remorse
jules
my
jules
trust
is
the
virtue
of
love
i
owe
to
you
that
i
am
at
this
moment
too
troubled
to
answer
you
but
i
am
not
a
false
woman
i
love
you
and
you
know
in
the
midst
of
all
that
can
shake
the
faith
of
man
and
rouse
his
jealousy
for
i
see
i
am
not
first
in
your
heart
i
am
no
longer
thine
own
self
well
clemence
even
so
i
prefer
to
believe
you
to
believe
that
voice
to
believe
those
eyes
if
you
deceive
me
you
deserve
ten
thousand
deaths
she
cried
interrupting
him
i
have
never
hidden
a
thought
from
you
but
you
hush
she
said
our
happiness
depends
upon
our
mutual
ha
i
know
all
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
violence
at
that
moment
the
cries
of
a
woman
were
heard
the
yelping
of
a
shrill
little
voice
came
from
the
antechamber
i
tell
you
i
will
go
in
it
cried
yes
i
shall
go
in
i
will
see
her
i
shall
see
her
jules
and
clemence
both
ran
to
the
salon
as
the
door
from
the
antechamber
was
violently
burst
open
a
young
woman
entered
hastily
followed
by
two
servants
who
said
to
their
master
monsieur
this
person
would
come
in
in
spite
of
us
we
told
her
that
madame
was
not
at
home
she
answered
that
she
knew
very
well
madame
had
been
out
but
she
saw
her
come
in
she
threatened
to
stay
at
the
door
of
the
house
till
she
could
speak
to
you
can
go
said
monsieur
desmarets
to
the
two
men
what
do
you
want
mademoiselle
he
added
turning
to
the
strange
woman
this
demoiselle
was
the
type
of
a
woman
who
is
never
to
be
met
with
except
in
paris
she
is
made
in
paris
like
the
mud
like
the
pavement
like
the
water
of
the
seine
such
as
it
becomes
in
paris
before
human
industry
filters
it
ten
times
ere
it
enters
the
decanters
and
sparkles
pure
and
bright
from
the
filth
it
has
been
she
is
therefore
a
being
who
is
truly
original
depicted
scores
of
times
by
the
painter
s
brush
the
pencil
of
the
caricaturist
the
charcoal
of
the
etcher
she
still
escapes
analysis
because
she
can
not
be
caught
and
rendered
in
all
her
moods
like
nature
like
this
fantastic
paris
itself
she
holds
to
vice
by
one
thread
only
and
she
breaks
away
from
it
at
a
thousand
other
points
of
the
social
circumference
besides
she
lets
only
one
trait
of
her
character
be
known
and
that
the
only
one
which
renders
her
blamable
her
noble
virtues
are
hidden
she
prefers
to
glory
in
her
naive
libertinism
most
incompletely
rendered
in
dramas
and
tales
where
she
is
put
upon
the
scene
with
all
her
poesy
she
is
nowhere
really
true
but
in
her
garret
elsewhere
she
is
invariably
calumniated
or
rich
she
deteriorates
poor
she
is
misunderstood
she
has
too
many
vices
and
too
many
good
qualities
she
is
too
near
to
pathetic
asphyxiation
or
to
a
dissolute
laugh
too
beautiful
and
too
hideous
she
personifies
paris
to
which
in
the
long
run
she
supplies
the
toothless
portresses
washerwomen
beggars
occasionally
insolent
countesses
admired
actresses
applauded
singers
she
has
even
given
in
the
olden
time
two
to
the
monarchy
who
can
grasp
such
a
proteus
she
is
all
woman
less
than
woman
more
than
woman
from
this
vast
portrait
the
painter
of
manners
and
morals
can
take
but
a
feature
here
and
there
the
is
infinite
she
was
a
grisette
of
paris
a
grisette
in
all
her
glory
a
grisette
in
a
happy
young
handsome
fresh
but
a
grisette
a
grisette
with
claws
scissors
impudent
as
a
spanish
woman
snarling
as
a
prudish
english
woman
proclaiming
her
conjugal
rights
coquettish
as
a
great
lady
though
more
frank
and
ready
for
everything
a
perfect
in
her
way
issuing
from
the
little
apartment
of
which
she
had
dreamed
so
often
with
its
curtains
its
utrecht
velvet
furniture
its
the
cabinet
of
china
with
painted
designs
the
sofa
the
little
moquette
carpet
the
alabaster
clock
and
candlesticks
under
glass
cases
the
yellow
bedroom
the
quilt
in
short
all
the
domestic
joys
of
a
grisette
s
life
and
in
addition
the
a
former
grisette
herself
now
the
owner
of
a
moustache
unlimited
bonbons
silk
dresses
bonnets
to
spoil
in
fact
all
the
felicities
coveted
by
the
grisette
heart
except
a
carriage
which
only
enters
her
imagination
as
a
marshal
s
baton
into
the
dreams
of
a
soldier
yes
this
grisette
had
all
these
things
in
return
for
a
true
affection
or
in
spite
of
a
true
affection
as
some
others
obtain
it
for
an
hour
a
day
a
sort
of
tax
carelessly
paid
under
the
claws
of
an
old
man
the
young
woman
who
now
entered
the
presence
of
monsieur
and
madame
jules
had
a
pair
of
feet
so
little
covered
by
her
shoes
that
only
a
slim
black
line
was
visible
between
the
carpet
and
her
white
stockings
this
peculiar
which
parisian
caricaturists
have
is
a
special
attribute
of
the
grisette
of
paris
but
she
is
even
more
distinctive
to
the
eyes
of
an
observer
by
the
care
with
which
her
garments
are
made
to
adhere
to
her
form
which
they
clearly
define
on
this
occasion
she
was
trigly
dressed
in
a
green
gown
with
a
white
chemisette
which
allowed
the
beauty
of
her
bust
to
be
seen
her
shawl
of
ternaux
cashmere
had
fallen
from
her
shoulders
and
was
held
by
its
two
corners
which
were
twisted
round
her
wrists
she
had
a
delicate
face
rosy
cheeks
a
white
skin
sparkling
gray
eyes
a
round
very
promising
forehead
hair
carefully
smoothed
beneath
her
little
bonnet
and
heavy
curls
upon
her
neck
my
name
is
ida
she
said
and
if
that
s
madame
jules
to
whom
i
have
the
advantage
of
speaking
i
ve
come
to
tell
her
all
i
have
in
my
heart
against
her
it
is
very
wrong
when
a
woman
is
set
up
and
in
her
furniture
as
you
are
here
to
come
and
take
from
a
poor
girl
a
man
with
whom
i
m
as
good
as
married
morally
and
who
did
talk
of
making
it
right
by
marrying
me
before
the
municipality
there
s
plenty
of
handsome
young
men
in
the
world
ain
t
there
monsieur
to
take
your
fancy
without
going
after
a
man
of
middle
age
who
makes
my
happiness
yah
i
haven
t
got
a
fine
hotel
like
this
but
i
ve
got
my
love
i
have
i
hate
handsome
men
and
money
i
m
all
heart
and
madame
jules
turned
to
her
husband
you
will
allow
me
monsieur
to
hear
no
more
of
all
this
she
said
retreating
to
her
bedroom
if
the
lady
lives
with
you
i
ve
made
a
mess
of
it
but
i
can
t
help
that
resumed
ida
why
does
she
come
after
monsieur
ferragus
every
day
you
are
mistaken
mademoiselle
said
jules
stupefied
my
wife
is
incapable
ha
so
you
re
married
you
two
said
the
grisette
showing
some
surprise
then
it
s
very
wrong
monsieur
isn
t
it
for
a
woman
who
has
the
happiness
of
being
married
in
legal
marriage
to
have
relations
with
a
man
like
henri
henri
who
is
henri
said
jules
taking
ida
by
the
arm
and
pulling
her
into
an
adjoining
room
that
his
wife
might
hear
no
more
why
monsieur
but
he
is
dead
said
jules
nonsense
i
went
to
franconi
s
with
him
last
night
and
he
brought
me
home
as
he
ought
besides
your
wife
can
tell
you
about
him
didn
t
she
go
there
this
very
afternoon
at
three
o
clock
i
know
she
did
for
i
waited
in
the
street
and
saw
her
all
because
that
fellow
monsieur
justin
whom
you
know
perhaps
a
little
old
man
with
jewelry
who
wears
corsets
told
me
that
madame
jules
was
my
rival
that
name
monsieur
sounds
mighty
like
a
feigned
one
but
if
it
is
yours
excuse
me
but
this
i
say
if
madame
jules
was
a
court
duchess
henri
is
rich
enough
to
satisfy
all
her
fancies
and
it
is
my
business
to
protect
my
property
i
ve
a
right
to
for
i
love
him
that
i
do
he
is
my
inclination
my
happiness
and
all
my
future
fate
depends
on
it
i
fear
nothing
monsieur
i
am
honest
i
never
lied
or
stole
the
property
of
any
living
soul
no
matter
who
if
an
empress
was
my
rival
i
d
go
straight
to
her
empress
as
she
was
because
all
pretty
women
are
equals
monsieur
enough
enough
said
jules
where
do
you
live
rue
de
la
number
monsieur
ida
gruget
at
your
service
for
we
make
lots
of
corsets
for
where
does
the
man
whom
you
call
ferragus
live
monsieur
she
said
pursing
up
her
lips
in
the
first
place
he
s
not
a
man
he
is
a
rich
monsieur
much
richer
perhaps
than
you
are
but
why
do
you
ask
me
his
address
when
your
wife
knows
it
he
told
me
not
to
give
it
am
i
obliged
to
answer
you
i
m
not
thank
god
in
a
confessional
or
a
i
m
responsible
only
to
if
i
were
to
offer
you
ten
thousand
francs
to
tell
me
where
monsieur
ferragus
lives
how
then
ha
n
o
my
little
friend
and
that
ends
the
matter
she
said
emphasizing
this
singular
reply
with
a
popular
gesture
there
s
no
sum
in
the
world
could
make
me
tell
you
i
have
the
honor
to
bid
you
how
do
i
get
out
of
here
jules
allowed
her
to
go
without
further
notice
the
whole
world
seemed
to
crumble
beneath
his
feet
and
above
him
the
heavens
were
falling
with
a
crash
monsieur
is
served
said
his
valet
the
valet
and
the
footman
waited
in
the
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
seeing
master
or
mistress
madame
will
not
dine
said
the
coming
in
what
s
the
matter
josephine
asked
the
valet
i
don
t
know
she
answered
madame
is
crying
and
is
going
to
bed
monsieur
has
no
doubt
got
some
on
hand
and
it
has
been
discovered
at
a
very
bad
time
i
wouldn
t
answer
for
madame
s
life
men
are
so
clumsy
they
ll
make
you
scenes
without
any
that
s
not
so
said
the
valet
in
a
low
voice
on
the
contrary
madame
is
the
one
who
you
understand
what
times
does
monsieur
have
to
go
after
pleasures
he
who
hasn
t
slept
out
of
madame
s
room
for
five
years
who
goes
to
his
study
at
ten
and
never
leaves
it
till
breakfast
at
twelve
his
life
is
all
known
it
is
regular
whereas
madame
goes
out
nearly
every
day
at
three
o
clock
heaven
knows
and
monsieur
too
said
the
maid
taking
her
mistress
s
part
yes
but
he
goes
straight
to
the
bourse
i
told
him
three
times
that
dinner
was
ready
continued
the
valet
after
a
pause
you
might
as
well
talk
to
a
monsieur
jules
entered
the
where
is
madame
he
said
madame
is
going
to
bed
her
head
aches
replied
the
maid
assuming
an
air
of
importance
monsieur
jules
then
said
to
the
footmen
composedly
you
can
take
away
i
shall
go
and
sit
with
he
went
to
his
wife
s
room
and
found
her
weeping
but
endeavoring
to
smother
her
sobs
with
her
handkerchief
why
do
you
weep
said
jules
you
need
expect
no
violence
and
no
reproaches
from
me
why
should
i
avenge
myself
if
you
have
not
been
faithful
to
my
love
it
is
that
you
were
never
worthy
of
not
worthy
the
words
were
repeated
amid
her
sobs
and
the
accent
in
which
they
were
said
would
have
moved
any
other
man
than
jules
to
kill
you
i
must
love
more
than
perhaps
i
do
love
you
he
continued
but
i
should
never
have
the
courage
i
would
rather
kill
myself
leaving
you
to
your
happiness
and
with
whom
he
did
not
end
his
sentence
kill
yourself
she
cried
flinging
herself
at
his
feet
and
clasping
them
but
he
wishing
to
escape
the
embrace
tried
to
shake
her
off
dragging
her
in
so
doing
toward
the
bed
let
me
alone
he
said
no
no
jules
she
cried
if
you
love
me
no
longer
i
shall
die
do
you
wish
to
know
all
he
took
her
grasped
her
violently
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
holding
her
between
his
legs
then
looking
at
that
beautiful
face
now
red
as
fire
and
furrowed
with
tears
speak
he
said
her
sobs
began
again
no
it
is
a
secret
of
life
and
death
if
i
tell
it
i
no
i
can
not
have
mercy
jules
you
have
betrayed
me
ah
jules
you
think
so
now
but
soon
you
will
know
but
this
ferragus
this
convict
whom
you
go
to
see
a
man
enriched
by
crime
if
he
does
not
belong
to
you
if
you
do
not
belong
to
him
oh
jules
speak
is
he
your
mysterious
benefactor
the
man
to
whom
we
owe
our
fortune
as
persons
have
said
already
who
said
that
a
man
whom
i
killed
in
a
oh
god
one
death
already
if
he
is
not
your
protector
if
he
does
not
give
you
money
if
it
is
you
on
the
contrary
who
carry
money
to
him
tell
me
is
he
your
brother
what
if
he
were
she
said
monsieur
desmarets
crossed
his
arms
why
should
that
have
been
concealed
from
me
he
said
then
you
and
your
mother
have
both
deceived
me
besides
does
a
woman
go
to
see
her
brother
every
day
or
nearly
every
day
his
wife
had
fainted
at
his
feet
dead
he
said
and
suppose
i
am
mistaken
he
sprang
to
the
called
josephine
and
lifted
clemence
to
the
bed
i
shall
die
of
this
said
madame
jules
recovering
consciousness
josephine
cried
monsieur
desmarets
send
for
monsieur
desplein
send
also
to
my
brother
and
ask
him
to
come
here
why
your
brother
asked
clemence
but
jules
had
already
left
the
room
chapter
iv
where
go
to
die
for
the
first
time
in
five
years
madame
jules
slept
alone
in
her
bed
and
was
compelled
to
admit
a
physician
into
that
sacred
chamber
these
in
themselves
were
two
keen
pangs
desplein
found
madame
jules
very
never
was
a
violent
emotion
more
untimely
he
would
say
nothing
definite
and
postponed
till
the
morrow
giving
any
opinion
after
leaving
a
few
directions
which
were
not
executed
the
emotions
of
the
heart
causing
all
bodily
cares
to
be
forgotten
when
morning
dawned
clemence
had
not
yet
slept
her
mind
was
absorbed
in
the
low
murmur
of
a
conversation
which
lasted
several
hours
between
the
brothers
but
the
thickness
of
the
walls
allowed
no
word
which
could
betray
the
object
of
this
long
conference
to
reach
her
ears
monsieur
desmarets
the
notary
went
away
at
last
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
the
singular
activity
of
the
senses
given
by
powerful
emotion
enabled
clemence
to
distinguish
the
scratching
of
a
pen
and
the
involuntary
movements
of
a
person
engaged
in
writing
those
who
are
habitually
up
at
night
and
who
observe
the
different
acoustic
effects
produced
in
absolute
silence
know
that
a
slight
echo
can
be
readily
perceived
in
the
very
places
where
louder
but
more
equable
and
continued
murmurs
are
not
distinct
at
four
o
clock
the
sound
ceased
clemence
rose
anxious
and
trembling
then
with
bare
feet
and
without
a
wrapper
forgetting
her
illness
and
her
moist
condition
the
poor
woman
opened
the
door
softly
without
noise
and
looked
into
the
next
room
she
saw
her
husband
sitting
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
asleep
in
his
the
candles
had
burned
to
the
sockets
she
slowly
advanced
and
read
on
an
envelope
already
sealed
the
words
this
is
my
she
knelt
down
as
if
before
an
open
grave
and
kissed
her
husband
s
hand
he
woke
instantly
jules
my
friend
they
grant
some
days
to
criminals
condemned
to
death
she
said
looking
at
him
with
eyes
that
blazed
with
fever
and
with
love
your
innocent
wife
asks
only
two
leave
me
free
for
two
days
and
wait
after
that
i
shall
die
happy
at
least
you
will
regret
clemence
i
grant
then
as
she
kissed
her
husband
s
hands
in
the
tender
transport
of
her
heart
jules
under
the
spell
of
that
cry
of
innocence
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
forehead
though
ashamed
to
feel
himself
still
under
subjection
to
the
power
of
that
noble
beauty
on
the
morrow
after
taking
a
few
hours
rest
jules
entered
his
wife
s
room
obeying
mechanically
his
invariable
custom
of
not
leaving
the
house
without
a
word
to
her
clemence
was
sleeping
a
ray
of
light
passing
through
a
chink
in
the
upper
blind
of
a
window
fell
across
the
face
of
the
dejected
woman
already
suffering
had
impaired
her
forehead
and
the
freshness
of
her
lips
a
lover
s
eye
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
appearance
of
dark
blotches
and
a
sickly
pallor
in
place
of
the
uniform
tone
of
the
cheeks
and
the
pure
ivory
whiteness
of
the
skin
two
points
at
which
the
sentiments
of
her
noble
soul
were
artlessly
wont
to
show
themselves
she
suffers
thought
jules
poor
clemence
may
god
protect
us
he
kissed
her
very
softly
on
the
forehead
she
woke
saw
her
husband
and
remembered
all
unable
to
speak
she
took
his
hand
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
i
am
innocent
she
said
ending
her
dream
you
will
not
go
out
will
you
asked
jules
no
i
feel
too
weak
to
leave
my
if
you
should
change
your
mind
wait
till
i
return
said
jules
then
he
went
down
to
the
porter
s
lodge
fouguereau
you
will
watch
the
door
yourself
i
wish
to
know
exactly
who
comes
to
the
house
and
who
leaves
then
he
threw
himself
into
a
and
was
driven
to
the
hotel
de
maulincour
where
he
asked
for
the
baron
monsieur
is
ill
they
told
him
jules
insisted
on
entering
and
gave
his
name
if
he
could
not
see
the
baron
he
wished
to
see
the
vidame
or
the
dowager
he
waited
some
time
in
the
salon
where
madame
de
maulincour
finally
came
to
him
and
told
him
that
her
grandson
was
much
too
ill
to
receive
him
i
know
madame
the
nature
of
his
illness
from
the
letter
you
did
me
the
honor
to
write
and
i
beg
you
to
believe
a
letter
to
you
monsieur
written
by
me
cried
the
dowager
interrupting
him
i
have
written
you
no
letter
what
was
i
made
to
say
in
that
letter
monsieur
madame
replied
jules
intending
to
see
monsieur
de
maulincour
i
thought
it
best
to
preserve
the
letter
in
spite
of
its
injunction
to
destroy
it
there
it
madame
de
maulincour
put
on
her
spectacles
and
the
moment
she
cast
her
eyes
on
the
paper
she
showed
the
utmost
surprise
monsieur
she
said
my
writing
is
so
perfectly
imitated
that
if
the
matter
were
not
so
recent
i
might
be
deceived
myself
my
grandson
is
ill
it
is
true
but
his
reason
has
never
for
a
moment
been
affected
we
are
the
puppets
of
some
person
or
persons
and
yet
i
can
not
imagine
the
object
of
a
trick
like
this
you
shall
see
my
grandson
monsieur
and
you
will
at
once
perceive
that
he
is
perfectly
sound
in
she
rang
the
bell
and
sent
to
ask
if
the
baron
felt
able
to
receive
monsieur
desmarets
the
servant
returned
with
an
affirmative
answer
jules
went
to
the
baron
s
room
where
he
found
him
in
an
near
the
fire
too
feeble
to
move
the
unfortunate
man
merely
bowed
his
head
with
a
melancholy
gesture
the
vidame
de
pamiers
was
sitting
with
him
monsieur
le
baron
said
jules
i
have
something
to
say
which
makes
it
desirable
that
i
should
see
you
monsieur
replied
auguste
monsieur
le
vidame
knows
about
this
affair
you
can
speak
fearlessly
before
monsieur
le
baron
said
jules
in
a
grave
voice
you
have
troubled
and
destroyed
my
happiness
without
having
any
right
to
do
so
until
the
moment
when
we
can
see
clearly
which
of
us
should
demand
or
grant
reparation
to
the
other
you
are
bound
to
help
me
in
following
the
dark
and
mysterious
path
into
which
you
have
flung
me
i
have
now
come
to
ascertain
from
you
the
present
residence
of
the
extraordinary
being
who
exercises
such
a
baneful
effect
on
your
life
and
mine
on
my
return
home
yesterday
after
listening
to
your
avowals
i
received
that
jules
gave
him
the
forged
letter
this
ferragus
this
bourignard
or
this
monsieur
de
funcal
is
a
demon
cried
maulincour
after
having
read
it
oh
what
a
frightful
maze
i
put
my
foot
into
when
i
meddled
in
this
matter
where
am
i
going
i
did
wrong
monsieur
he
continued
looking
at
jules
but
death
is
the
greatest
of
all
expiations
and
my
death
is
now
approaching
you
can
ask
me
whatever
you
like
i
am
at
your
monsieur
you

of
course
where
this
man
is
living
and
i
must
know
it
if
it
costs
me
all
my
fortune
to
penetrate
this
mystery
in
presence
of
so
cruel
an
enemy
every
moment
is
justin
shall
tell
you
all
replied
the
baron
at
these
words
the
vidame
fidgeted
on
his
chair
auguste
rang
the
bell
justin
is
not
in
the
house
cried
the
vidame
in
a
hasty
manner
that
told
much
well
then
said
auguste
excitedly
the
other
servants
must
know
where
he
is
send
a
man
on
horseback
to
fetch
him
your
valet

in
paris

t
he

vidame

visibly
distressed
justin
can
t
come
my
dear
boy
said
the
old
man
he
is
dead
i
wanted
to
conceal
the
accident
from
you
but
dead
cried
monsieur
de
maulincour
dead
when
and
how
last
night
he
had
been
supping
with
some
old
friends
and
i
dare
say
was
drunk
his
friends
no
doubt
they
were
drunk
too
left
him
lying
in
the
street
and
a
heavy
vehicle
ran
over
the
convict
did
not
miss
at
the
first
stroke
he
killed
said
auguste
he
has
had
less
luck
with
me
it
has
taken
four
blows
to
put
me
out
of
the
jules
was
gloomy
and
thoughtful
am
i
to
know
nothing
then
he
cried
after
a
long
pause
your
valet
seems
to
have
been
justly
punished
did
he
not
exceed
your
orders
in
calumniating
madame
desmarets
to
a
person
named
ida
whose
jealousy
he
roused
in
order
to
turn
her
vindictiveness
upon
us
ah
monsieur
in
my
anger
i
informed
him
about
madame
jules
said
auguste
monsieur
cried
the
husband
keenly
irritated
oh
monsieur
replied
the
baron
claiming
silence
by
a
gesture
i
am
prepared
for
all
you
can
not
tell
me
anything
my
own
conscience
has
not
already
told
me
i
am
now
expecting
the
most
celebrated
of
all
professors
of
toxicology
in
order
to
learn
my
fate
if
i
am
destined
to
intolerable
suffering
my
resolution
is
taken
i
shall
blow
my
brains
you
talk
like
a
child
cried
the
vidame
horrified
by
the
coolness
with
which
the
baron
said
these
words
your
grandmother
would
die
of
then
monsieur
said
jules
am
i
to
understand
that
there
exist
no
means
of
discovering
in
what
part
of
paris
this
extraordinary
man
resides
i
think
monsieur
said
the
old
vidame
from
what
i
have
heard
poor
justin
say
that
monsieur
de
funcal
lives
at
either
the
portuguese
or
the
brazilian
embassy
monsieur
de
funcal
is
a
nobleman
belonging
to
both
those
countries
as
for
the
convict
he
is
dead
and
buried
your
persecutor
whoever
he
is
seems
to
me
so
powerful
that
it
would
be
well
to
take
no
decisive
measures
until
you
are
sure
of
some
way
of
confounding
and
crushing
him
act
prudently
and
with
caution
my
dear
monsieur
had
monsieur
de
maulincour
followed
my
advice
nothing
of
all
this
would
have
jules
coldly
but
politely
withdrew
he
was
now
at
a
total
loss
to
know
how
to
reach
ferragus
as
he
passed
into
his
own
house
the
porter
told
him
that
madame
had
just
been
out
to
throw
a
letter
into
the
post
box
at
the
head
of
the
rue
de
menars
jules
felt
humiliated
by
this
proof
of
the
insight
with
which
the
porter
espoused
his
cause
and
the
cleverness
by
which
he
guessed
the
way
to
serve
him
the
eagerness
of
servants
and
their
shrewdness
in
compromising
masters
who
compromised
themselves
was
known
to
him
and
he
fully
appreciated
the
danger
of
having
them
as
accomplices
no
matter
for
what
purpose
but
he
could
not
think
of
his
personal
dignity
until
the
moment
when
he
found
himself
thus
suddenly
degraded
what
a
triumph
for
the
slave
who
could
not
raise
himself
to
his
master
to
compel
his
master
to
come
down
to
his
level
jules
was
harsh
and
hard
to
him
another
fault
but
he
suffered
so
deeply
his
life
till
then
so
upright
so
pure
was
becoming
crafty
he
was
to
scheme
and
lie
clemence
was
scheming
and
lying
this
to
him
was
a
moment
of
horrible
disgust
lost
in
a
flood
of
bitter
feelings
jules
stood
motionless
at
the
door
of
his
house
yielding
to
despair
he
thought
of
fleeing
of
leaving
france
forever
carrying
with
him
the
illusions
of
uncertainty
then
again
not
doubting
that
the
letter
clemence
had
just
posted
was
addressed
to
ferragus
his
mind
searched
for
a
means
of
obtaining
the
answer
that
mysterious
being
was
certain
to
send
then
his
thoughts
began
to
analyze
the
singular
good
fortune
of
his
life
since
his
marriage
and
he
asked
himself
whether
the
calumny
for
which
he
had
taken
such
signal
vengeance
was
not
a
truth
finally
reverting
to
the
coming
answer
he
said
to
himself
but
this
man
so
profoundly
capable
so
logical
in
his
every
act
who
sees
and
foresees
who
calculates
and
even
divines
our
very
thoughts
is
he
likely
to
make
an
answer
will
he
not
employ
some
other
means
more
in
keeping
with
his
power
he
may
send
his
answer
by
some
beggar
or
in
a
carton
brought
by
an
honest
man
who
does
not
suspect
what
he
brings
or
in
some
parcel
of
shoes
which
a
may
innocently
deliver
to
my
wife
if
clemence
and
he
have
agreed
upon
such
means
he
distrusted
all
things
his
mind
ran
over
vast
tracts
and
shoreless
oceans
of
conjecture
then
after
floating
for
a
time
among
a
thousand
contradictory
ideas
he
felt
he
was
strongest
in
his
own
house
and
he
resolved
to
watch
it
as
the
watches
his
sandy
labyrinth
fouguereau
he
said
to
the
porter
i
am
not
at
home
to
any
one
who
comes
to
see
me
if
any
one
calls
to
see
madame
or
brings
her
anything
ring
twice
bring
all
letters
addressed
here
to
me
no
matter
for
whom
they
are
thus
thought
he
as
he
entered
his
study
which
was
in
the
entresol
i
forestall
the
schemes
of
this
ferragus
if
he
sends
some
one
to
ask
for
me
so
as
to
find
out
if
clemence
is
alone
at
least
i
shall
not
be
tricked
like
a
he
stood
by
the
window
of
his
study
which
looked
upon
the
street
and
then
a
final
scheme
inspired
by
jealousy
came
into
his
mind
he
resolved
to
send
his
in
his
own
carriage
to
the
bourse
with
a
letter
to
another
broker
explaining
his
sales
and
purchases
and
requesting
him
to
do
his
business
for
that
day
he
postponed
his
more
delicate
transactions
till
the
morrow
indifferent
to
the
fall
or
rise
of
stocks
or
the
debts
of
all
europe
high
privilege
of
love
it
crushes
all
things
all
interests
fall
before
it
altar
throne
consols
at
three
just
the
hour
at
which
the
bourse
is
in
full
blast
of
reports
monthly
settlements
premiums
fouguereau
entered
the
study
quite
radiant
with
his
news
monsieur
an
old
woman
has
come
but
very
cautiously
i
think
she
s
a
sly
one
she
asked
for
monsieur
and
seemed
much
annoyed
when
i
told
her
he
was
out
then
she
gave
me
a
letter
for
madame
and
here
it
fevered
with
anxiety
jules
opened
the
letter
then
he
dropped
into
a
chair
exhausted
the
letter
was
mere
nonsense
throughout
and
needed
a
key
it
was
virtually
in
cipher
go
away
the
porter
left
him
it
is
a
mystery
deeper
than
the
sea
below
the
plummet
line
ah
it
must
be
love
love
only
is
so
sagacious
so
inventive
as
this
ah
i
shall
kill
at
this
moment
an
idea
flashed
through
his
brain
with
such
force
that
he
felt
almost
physically
illuminated
by
it
in
the
days
of
his
toilsome
poverty
before
his
marriage
jules
had
made
for
himself
a
true
friend
the
extreme
delicacy
with
which
he
had
managed
the
susceptibilities
of
a
man
both
poor
and
modest
the
respect
with
which
he
had
surrounded
him
the
ingenious
cleverness
he
had
employed
to
nobly
compel
him
to
share
his
opulence
without
permitting
it
to
make
him
blush
increased
their
friendship
jacquet
continued
faithful
to
desmarets
in
spite
of
his
wealth
jacquet
a
nobly
upright
man
a
toiler
austere
in
his
morals
had
slowly
made
his
way
in
that
particular
ministry
which
develops
both
honesty
and
knavery
at
the
same
time
a
clerk
in
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
he
had
charge
of
the
most
delicate
division
of
its
archives
jacquet
in
that
office
was
like
a
casting
his
light
upon
those
secret
correspondences
deciphering
and
classifying
despatches
ranking
higher
than
a
mere
his
position
at
the
ministry
was
superior
to
that
of
the
other
subalterns
he
lived
obscurely
glad
to
feel
that
such
obscurity
sheltered
him
from
reverses
and
disappointments
and
was
satisfied
to
humbly
pay
in
the
lowest
coin
his
debt
to
the
country
thanks
to
jules
his
position
had
been
much
ameliorated
by
a
worthy
marriage
an
unrecognized
patriot
a
minister
in
actual
fact
he
contented
himself
with
groaning
in
his
at
the
course
of
the
government
in
his
own
home
jacquet
was
an
king
an
as
they
say
who
hired
a
carriage
for
his
wife
which
he
never
entered
himself
in
short
to
end
this
sketch
of
a
philosopher
unknown
to
himself
he
had
never
suspected
and
never
in
all
his
life
would
suspect
the
advantages
he
might
have
drawn
from
his
position
that
of
having
for
his
intimate
friend
a
broker
and
of
knowing
every
morning
all
the
secrets
of
the
state
this
man
sublime
after
the
manner
of
that
nameless
soldier
who
died
in
saving
napoleon
by
a
qui
vive
lived
at
the
ministry
in
ten
minutes
jules
was
in
his
friend
s
office
jacquet
gave
him
a
chair
laid
aside
methodically
his
green
silk
rubbed
his
hands
picked
up
his
rose
stretched
himself
till
his
cracked
swelled
out
his
chest
and
said
what
brings
you
here
monsieur
desmarets
what
do
you
want
with
me
jacquet
i
want
you
to
decipher
a
secret
a
secret
of
life
and
it
doesn
t
concern
politics
if
it
did
i
shouldn
t
come
to
you
for
information
said
jules
no
it
is
a
family
matter
about
which
i
require
you
to
be
absolutely
jacquet
dumb
by
profession
don
t
you
know
me
by
this
time
he
said
laughing
discretion

my
jules
showed
him
the
letter
you
must
read
me
this
letter
addressed
to
my
the
deuce
the
deuce
a
bad
business
said
jacquet
examining
the
letter
as
a
usurer
examines
a
note
to
be
negotiated
ha
that
s
a
gridiron
letter
wait
a
he
left
jules
alone
for
a
moment
but
returned
immediately
easy
enough
to
read
my
friend
it
is
written
on
the
gridiron
plan
used
by
the
portuguese
minister
under
monsieur
de
choiseul
at
the
time
of
the
dismissal
of
the
jesuits
here
see
jacquet
placed
upon
the
writing
a
piece
of
paper
cut
out
in
regular
squares
like
the
paper
laces
which
confectioners
wrap
round
their
sugarplums
and
jules
then
read
with
perfect
ease
the
words
that
were
visible
in
the
interstices
they
were
as
follows
don
t
be
uneasy
my
dear
clemence
our
happiness
can
not
again
be
troubled
and
your
husband
will
soon
lay
aside
his
suspicions
however
ill
you
may
be
you
must
have
the
courage
to
come
here
find
strength
in
your
love
for
me
mine
for
you
has
induced
me
to
submit
to
a
cruel
operation
and
i
can
not
leave
my
bed
i
have
had
the
actual
cautery
applied
to
my
back
and
it
was
necessary
to
burn
it
in
a
long
time
you
understand
me
but
i
thought
of
you
and
i
did
not
suffer
to
baffle
maulincour
who
will
not
persecute
us
much
longer
i
have
left
the
protecting
roof
of
the
embassy
and
am
now
safe
from
all
inquiry
in
the
rue
des
number
with
an
old
woman
madame
etienne
gruget
mother
of
that
ida
who
shall
pay
dear
for
her
folly
come
at
nine
in
the
morning
i
am
in
a
room
which
is
reached
only
by
an
interior
staircase
ask
for
monsieur
camuset
adieu
i
kiss
your
forehead
my
jacquet
looked
at
jules
with
a
sort
of
honest
terror
the
sign
of
a
true
compassion
as
he
made
his
favorite
exclamation
in
two
separate
and
distinct
tones
the
deuce
the
deuce
that
seems
clear
to
you
doesn
t
it
said
jules
well
in
the
depths
of
my
heart
there
is
a
voice
that
pleads
for
my
wife
and
makes
itself
heard
above
the
pangs
of
jealousy
i
must
endure
the
worst
of
all
agony
until
but
between
nine
and
ten
i
shall
know
all
i
shall
be
happy
or
wretched
for
all
my
life
think
of
me
then
i
shall
be
at
your
house
at
eight
o
clock
we
will
go
together
i
ll
wait
for
you
if
you
like
in
the
street
you
may
run
some
danger
and
you
ought
to
have
near
you
some
devoted
person
who
ll
understand
a
mere
sign
and
whom
you
can
safely
trust
count
on
even
to
help
me
in
killing
some
one
the
deuce
the
deuce
said
jacquet
repeating
as
it
were
the
same
musical
note
i
have
two
children
and
a
jules
pressed
his
friend
s
hand
and
went
away
but
returned
immediately
i
forgot
the
letter
he
said
but
that
s
not
all
i
must
reseal
the
deuce
the
deuce
you
opened
it
without
saving
the
seal
however
it
is
still
possible
to
restore
it
leave
it
with
me
and
i
ll
bring
it
to
you
at
what
time
if
i
am
not
yet
in
give
it
to
the
porter
and
tell
him
to
send
it
up
to
do
you
want
me
no
jules
drove
at
once
to
the
place
de
la
rotonde
du
temple
where
he
left
his
cabriolet
and
went
on
foot
to
the
rue
des
he
found
the
house
of
madame
etienne
gruget
and
examined
it
there
the
mystery
on
which
depended
the
fate
of
so
many
persons
would
be
cleared
up
there
at
this
moment
was
ferragus
and
to
ferragus
all
the
threads
of
this
strange
plot
led
the
gordian
knot
of
the
drama
already
so
bloody
was
surely
in
a
meeting
between
madame
jules
her
husband
and
that
man
and
a
blade
able
to
cut
the
closest
of
such
knots
would
not
be
wanting
the
house
was
one
of
those
which
belong
to
the
class
called
this
significant
name
is
given
by
the
populace
of
paris
to
houses
which
are
built
as
it
were
piecemeal
they
are
nearly
always
composed
of
buildings
originally
separate
but
afterwards
united
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
various
proprietors
who
successively
enlarge
them
or
else
they
are
houses
begun
left
unfinished
again
built
upon
and
completed
unfortunate
structures
which
have
passed
like
certain
peoples
under
many
dynasties
of
capricious
masters
neither
the
floors
nor
the
windows
have
an
to
borrow
one
of
the
most
picturesque
terms
of
the
art
of
painting
all
is
discord
even
the
external
decoration
the

to
parisian
architecture
what
the
is
to
the
apartment
a
where
the
most
heterogeneous
articles
are
flung
madame
etienne
asked
jules
of
the
portress
this
portress
had
her
lodge
under
the
main
entrance
in
a
sort
of
chicken
coop
or
wooden
house
on
rollers
not
unlike
those
which
the
police
have
lately
set
up
by
the
stands
of
hein
said
the
portress
without
laying
down
the
stocking
she
was
knitting
in
paris
the
various
component
parts
which
make
up
the
physiognomy
of
any
given
portion
of
the
monstrous
city
are
admirably
in
keeping
with
its
general
character
thus
porter
concierge
or
suisse
whatever
name
may
be
given
to
that
essential
muscle
of
the
parisian
monster
is
always
in
conformity
with
the
neighborhood
of
which
he
is
a
part
in
fact
he
is
often
an
epitome
of
it
the
lazy
porter
of
the
faubourg
with
lace
on
every
seam
of
his
coat
dabbles
in
stocks
he
of
the
chaussee
d
antin
takes
his
ease
reads
the
in
the
newspapers
and
has
a
business
of
his
own
in
the
faubourg
montmartre
the
portress
in
the
quarter
of
prostitution
was
formerly
a
prostitute
in
the
marais
she
has
morals
is
and
full
of
crotchets
on
seeing
monsieur
jules
this
particular
portress
holding
her
knitting
in
one
hand
took
a
knife
and
stirred
the
peat
in
her
then
she
said
you
want
madame
etienne
do
you
mean
madame
etienne
gruget
yes
said
jules
assuming
a
vexed
air
who
makes
trimmings
well
then
monsieur
she
said
issuing
from
her
cage
and
laying
her
hand
on
jules
arm
and
leading
him
to
the
end
of
a
long
vaulted
like
a
cellar
go
up
the
second
staircase
at
the
end
of
the
where
you
will
see
the
windows
with
the
pots
of
pinks
that
s
where
madame
etienne
thank
you
madame
do
you
think
she
is
alone
why
shouldn
t
she
be
alone
she
s
a
jules
hastened
up
a
dark
stairway
the
steps
of
which
were
knobby
with
hardened
mud
left
by
the
feet
of
those
who
came
and
went
on
the
second
floor
he
saw
three
doors
but
no
signs
of
pinks
fortunately
on
one
of
the
doors
the
oiliest
and
darkest
of
the
three
he
read
these
words
chalked
on
a
panel
ida
will
come
at
nine
o
this
is
the
place
thought
jules
he
pulled
an
old
bellrope
black
with
age
and
heard
the
smothered
sound
of
a
cracked
bell
and
the
barking
of
an
asthmatic
little
dog
by
the
way
the
sounds
echoed
from
the
interior
he
knew
that
the
rooms
were
encumbered
with
articles
which
left
no
space
for
reverberation
a
characteristic
feature
of
the
homes
of
workmen
and
humble
households
where
space
and
air
are
always
lacking
jules
looked
out
mechanically
for
the
pinks
and
found
them
on
the
outer
sill
of
a
sash
window
between
two
filthy
so
here
were
flowers
here
a
garden
two
yards
long
and
six
inches
wide
here
a
here
a
whole
life
epitomized
but
here
too
all
the
miseries
of
that
life
a
ray
of
light
falling
from
heaven
as
if
by
special
favor
on
those
puny
flowers
and
the
vigorous
brought
out
in
full
relief
the
dust
the
grease
and
that
nameless
color
peculiar
to
parisian
squalor
made
of
dirt
which
crusted
and
spotted
the
damp
walls
the
balusters
the
disjointed
and
the
door
originally
red
presently
the
cough
of
an
old
woman
and
a
heavy
female
step
shuffling
painfully
in
list
slippers
announced
the
coming
of
the
mother
of
ida
gruget
the
creature
opened
the
door
and
came
out
upon
the
landing
looked
up
and
said
ah
is
this
monsieur
bocquillon
why
no
but
perhaps
you
re
his
brother
what
can
i
do
for
you
come
in
jules
followed
her
into
the
first
room
where
he
saw
huddled
together
cages
household
utensils
ovens
furniture
little
earthenware
dishes
full
of
food
or
water
for
the
dog
and
the
cats
a
wooden
clock
engravings
of
eisen
heaps
of
old
iron
all
these
things
mingled
and
massed
together
in
a
way
that
produced
a
most
grotesque
effect
a
true
parisian
dusthole
in
which
were
not
lacking
a
few
old
numbers
of
the
jules
impelled
by
a
sense
of
prudence
paid
no
attention
to
the
widow
s
invitation
when
she
said
civilly
showing
him
an
inner
room
come
in
here
monsieur
and
warm
fearing
to
be
overheard
by
ferragus
jules
asked
himself
whether
it
were
not
wisest
to
conclude
the
arrangement
he
had
come
to
make
with
the
old
woman
in
the
crowded
antechamber
a
hen
which
descended
cackling
from
a
loft
roused
him
from
this
inward
meditation
he
came
to
a
resolution
and
followed
ida
s
mother
into
the
inner
room
whither
they
were
accompanied
by
the
wheezy
pug
a
personage
otherwise
mute
who
jumped
upon
a
stool
madame
gruget
showed
the
assumption
of
when
she
invited
her
visitor
to
warm
himself
her

or
rather
concealed
two
bits
of
sticks
which
lay
apart
the
grating
was
on
the
ground
its
handle
in
the
ashes
the
adorned
with
a
little
wax
jesus
under
a
shade
of
squares
of
glass
held
together
with
blue
paper
was
piled
with
wools
bobbins
and
tools
used
in
the
making
of
gimps
and
trimmings
jules
examined
everything
in
the
room
with
a
curiosity
that
was
full
of
interest
and
showed
in
spite
of
himself
an
inward
satisfaction
well
monsieur
tell
me
do
you
want
to
buy
any
of
my
things
said
the
old
woman
seating
herself
in
a
cane
which
appeared
to
be
her
headquarters
in
it
she
kept
her
handkerchief
snuffbox
knitting
vegetables
spectacles
calendar
a
bit
of
livery
gold
lace
just
begun
a
greasy
pack
of
cards
and
two
volumes
of
novels
all
stuck
into
the
hollow
of
the
back
this
article
of
furniture
in
which
the
old
creature
was
floating
down
the
river
of
life
was
not
unlike
the
encyclopedic
bag
which
a
woman
carries
with
her
when
she
travels
in
which
may
be
found
a
compendium
of
her
household
belongings
from
the
portrait
of
her
husband
to
de
for
faintness
sugarplums
for
the
children
and
english
in
case
of
cuts
jules
studied
all
he
looked
attentively
at
madame
gruget
s
yellow
visage
at
her
gray
eyes
without
either
brows
or
lashes
her
toothless
mouth
her
wrinkles
marked
in
black
her
rusty
cap
her
still
more
rusty
ruffles
her
cotton
petticoat
full
of
holes
her
slippers
her
disabled
her
table
heaped
with
dishes
and
silks
and
work
begun
or
finished
in
wool
or
cotton
in
the
midst
of
which
stood
a
bottle
of
wine
then
he
said
to
himself
this
old
woman
has
some
passion
some
strong
liking
or
vice
i
can
make
her
do
my
madame
he
said
aloud
with
a
private
sign
of
intelligence
i
have
come
to
order
some
livery
then
he
lowered
his
voice
i
know
he
continued
that
you
have
a
lodger
who
has
taken
the
name
of
the
old
woman
looked
at
him
suddenly
but
without
any
sign
of
astonishment
now
tell
me
can
we
come
to
an
understanding
this
is
a
question
which
means
fortune
for
monsieur
she
replied
speak
out
and
don
t
be
afraid
there
s
no
one
here
but
if
i
had
any
one
above
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
hear
ha
the
sly
old
creature
she
answers
like
a
norman
thought
jules
we
shall
agree
do
not
give
yourself
the
trouble
to
tell
falsehoods
madame
he
resumed
in
the
first
place
let
me
tell
you
that
i
mean
no
harm
either
to
you
or
to
your
lodger
who
is
suffering
from
cautery
or
to
your
daughter
ida
a
the
friend
of
ferragus
you
see
i
know
all
your
affairs
do
not
be
uneasy
i
am
not
a
detective
policeman
nor
do
i
desire
anything
that
can
hurt
your
conscience
a
young
lady
will
come
here
at
nine
o
clock
to
talk
with
this
lover
of
your
daughter
i
want
to
be
where
i
can
see
all
and
hear
all
without
being
seen
or
heard
by
them
if
you
will
furnish
me
with
the
means
of
doing
so
i
will
reward
that
service
with
the
gift
of
two
thousand
francs
and
a
yearly
stipend
of
six
hundred
my
notary
shall
prepare
a
deed
before
you
this
evening
and
i
will
give
him
the
money
to
hold
he
will
pay
the
two
thousand
to
you
after
the
conference
at
which
i
desire
to
be
present
as
you
will
then
have
given
proofs
of
your
good
will
it
injure
my
daughter
my
good
monsieur
she
asked
casting
a
glance
of
doubt
and
uneasiness
upon
him
in
no
way
madame
but
in
any
case
it
seems
to
me
that
your
daughter
does
not
treat
you
well
a
girl
who
is
loved
by
so
rich
a
man
as
ferragus
ought
to
make
you
more
comfortable
than
you
seem
to
ah
my
dear
monsieur
just
think
not
so
much
as
one
poor
ticket
to
the
ambigu
or
the
gaiete
where
she
can
go
as
much
as
she
likes
it
s
shameful
a
girl
for
whom
i
sold
my
silver
forks
and
spoons
and
now
i
eat
at
my
age
with
german
metal
and
all
to
pay
for
her
apprenticeship
and
give
her
a
trade
where
she
could
coin
money
if
she
chose
as
for
that
she
s
like
me
clever
as
a
witch
i
must
do
her
that
justice
but
i
will
say
she
might
give
me
her
old
silk
gowns
i
who
am
so
fond
of
wearing
silk
but
no
monsieur
she
dines
at
the
at
fifty
francs
a
head
and
rolls
in
her
carriage
as
if
she
were
a
princess
and
despises
her
mother
for
a
heavens
and
earth
what
heedless
young
ones
we
ve
brought
into
the
world
we
have
nothing
to
boast
of
there
a
mother
monsieur
can
t
be
anything
else
but
a
good
mother
and
i
ve
concealed
that
girl
s
ways
and
kept
her
in
my
bosom
to
take
the
bread
out
of
my
mouth
and
cram
everything
into
her
own
well
well
and
now
she
comes
and
fondles
one
a
little
and
says
how
d
ye
do
mother
and
that
s
all
the
duty
she
thinks
of
paying
but
she
ll
have
children
one
of
these
days
and
then
she
ll
find
out
what
it
is
to
have
such
baggage
which
one
can
t
help
loving
all
the
do
you
mean
that
she
does
nothing
for
you
ah
nothing
no
monsieur
i
didn
t
say
that
if
she
did
nothing
that
would
be
a
little
too
much
she
gives
me
my
rent
and
francs
a
month
but
monsieur
at
my
age
and
i
m
years
old
with
eyes
that
feel
the
strain
at
night
ought
i
to
be
working
in
this
way
besides
why
won
t
she
have
me
to
live
with
her
i
should
shame
her
should
i
then
let
her
say
so
faith
one
ought
to
be
buried
out
of
the
way
of
such
dogs
of
children
who
forget
you
before
they
ve
even
shut
the
she
pulled
her
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
and
with
it
a
lottery
ticket
that
dropped
on
the
floor
but
she
hastily
picked
it
up
saying
hi
that
s
the
receipt
for
my
jules
at
once
perceived
the
reason
of
the
sagacious
parsimony
of
which
the
mother
complained
and
he
was
the
more
certain
that
the
widow
gruget
would
agree
to
the
proposed
bargain
well
then
madame
he
said
accept
what
i
offer
did
you
say
two
thousand
francs
in
ready
money
and
six
hundred
annuity
monsieur
madame
i
ve
changed
my
mind
i
will
promise
you
only
three
hundred
annuity
this
way
seems
more
to
my
own
interests
but
i
will
give
you
five
thousand
francs
in
ready
money
wouldn
t
you
like
that
as
well
bless
me
yes
monsieur
you
ll
get
more
comfort
out
of
it
and
you
can
go
to
the
ambigu
and
franconi
s
at
your
ease
in
a
as
for
franconi
i
don
t
like
that
for
they
don
t
talk
there
monsieur
if
i
accept
it
is
because
it
will
be
very
advantageous
for
my
child
i
sha
n
t
be
a
drag
on
her
any
longer
poor
little
thing
i
m
glad
she
has
her
pleasures
after
all
ah
monsieur
youth
must
be
amused
and
so
if
you
assure
me
that
no
harm
will
come
to
anybody
not
to
anybody
replied
jules
but
now
how
will
you
manage
it
well
monsieur
if
i
give
monsieur
ferragus
a
little
tea
made
of
he
ll
sleep
sound
the
dear
man
and
he
needs
it
too
because
of
his
sufferings
for
he
does
suffer
i
can
tell
you
and
more
s
the
pity
but
i
d
like
to
know
what
a
healthy
man
like
him
wants
to
burn
his
back
for
just
to
get
rid
of
a
tic
douleureux
which
troubles
him
once
in
two
years
however
to
come
back
to
our
business
i
have
my
neighbor
s
key
her
lodging
is
just
above
mine
and
in
it
there
s
a
room
adjoining
the
one
where
monsieur
ferragus
is
with
only
a
partition
between
them
my
neighbor
is
away
in
the
country
for
ten
days
therefore
if
i
make
a
hole
while
monsieur
ferragus
is
sound
asleep
you
can
see
and
hear
them
at
your
ease
i
m
on
good
terms
with
a
locksmith
a
very
friendly
man
who
talks
like
an
angel
and
he
ll
do
the
work
for
me
and
say
nothing
about
then
here
s
a
hundred
francs
for
him
come
to
monsieur
desmaret
s
office
he
s
a
notary
and
here
s
his
address
at
nine
o
clock
the
deed
will
be
ready
but
silence
enough
monsieur
as
you
say
silence
au
revoir
jules
went
home
almost
calmed
by
the
certainty
that
he
should
know
the
truth
on
the
morrow
as
he
entered
the
house
the
porter
gave
him
the
letter
properly
resealed
how
do
you
feel
now
he
said
to
his
wife
in
spite
of
the
coldness
that
separated
them
pretty
well
jules
she
answered
in
a
coaxing
voice
do
come
and
dine
beside
very
good
he
said
giving
her
the
letter
here
is
something
fouguereau
gave
me
for
clemence
who
was
very
pale
colored
high
when
she
saw
the
letter
and
that
sudden
redness
was
a
fresh
blow
to
her
husband
is
that
joy
he
said
laughing
or
the
effect
of
expectation
oh
of
many
things
she
said
examining
the
seal
i
leave
you
now
for
a
few
he
went
down
to
his
study
and
wrote
to
his
brother
giving
him
directions
about
the
payment
to
the
widow
gruget
when
he
returned
he
found
his
dinner
served
on
a
little
table
by
his
wife
s
bedside
and
josephine
ready
to
wait
on
him
if
i
were
up
how
i
should
like
to
serve
you
myself
said
clemence
when
josephine
had
left
them
oh
yes
on
my
knees
she
added
passing
her
white
hands
through
her
husband
s
hair
dear
noble
heart
you
were
very
kind
and
gracious
to
me
just
now
you
did
me
more
good
by
showing
me
such
confidence
than
all
the
doctors
on
earth
could
do
me
with
their
prescriptions
that
feminine
delicacy
of
yours
for
you
do
know
how
to
love
like
a
woman
well
it
has
shed
a
balm
into
my
heart
which
has
almost
cured
me
there
s
truce
between
us
jules
lower
your
head
that
i
may
kiss
jules
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
that
embrace
but
it
was
not
without
a
feeling
of
remorse
in
his
heart
he
felt
himself
small
before
this
woman
whom
he
was
still
tempted
to
think
innocent
a
sort
of
melancholy
joy
possessed
him
a
tender
hope
shone
on
her
features
in
spite
of
their
grieved
expression
they
both
were
equally
unhappy
in
deceiving
each
other
another
caress
and
unable
to
resist
their
suffering
all
would
then
have
been
avowed
evening
no
no
morning
by
twelve
o
clock
you
will
know
all
and
you
ll
kneel
down
before
your
wife
oh
no
you
shall
not
be
humiliated
you
are
all
forgiven
now
you
have
done
no
wrong
listen
jules
yesterday
you
did
crush
me
harshly
but
perhaps
my
life
would
not
have
been
complete
without
that
agony
it
may
be
a
shadow
that
will
make
our
coming
days
you
lay
a
spell
upon
me
cried
jules
you
fill
me
with
poor
love
destiny
is
stronger
than
we
and
i
am
not
the
accomplice
of
mine
i
shall
go
out
at
what
hour
asked
jules
at
clemence
he
said
take
every
precaution
consult
doctor
desplein
and
old
i
shall
consult
nothing
but
my
heart
and
my
i
shall
leave
you
free
you
will
not
see
me
till
twelve
o
won
t
you
keep
me
company
this
evening
i
feel
so
much
after
attending
to
some
business
jules
returned
to
his
wife
recalled
by
her
invincible
attraction
his
passion
was
stronger
than
his
anguish
the
next
day
at
nine
o
clock
jules
left
home
hurried
to
the
rue
des
went
upstairs
and
rang
the
bell
of
the
widow
gruget
s
lodgings
ah
you
ve
kept
your
word
as
true
as
the
dawn
come
in
monsieur
said
the
old
woman
when
she
saw
him
i
ve
made
you
a
cup
of
coffee
with
cream
she
added
when
the
door
was
closed
oh
real
cream
i
saw
it
milked
myself
at
the
dairy
we
have
in
this
very
thank
you
no
madame

take
me
at
once
very
good
monsieur
follow
me
this
she
led
him
up
into
the
room
above
her
own
where
she
showed
him
triumphantly
an
opening
about
the
size
of
a
piece
made
during
the
night
in
a
place
which
in
each
room
was
above
a
wardrobe
in
order
to
look
through
it
jules
was
forced
to
maintain
himself
in
rather
a
fatiguing
attitude
by
standing
on
a
which
the
widow
had
been
careful
to
place
there
there
s
a
gentleman
with
him
she
whispered
as
she
retired
jules
then
beheld
a
man
employed
in
dressing
a
number
of
wounds
on
the
shoulders
of
ferragus
whose
head
he
recognized
from
the
description
given
to
him
by
monsieur
de
maulincour
when
do
you
think
those
wounds
will
heal
asked
ferragus
i
don
t
know
said
the
other
man
the
doctors
say
those
wounds
will
require
seven
or
eight
more
well
then
until
said
ferragus
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
man
who
had
just
replaced
the
bandage
yes
said
the
other
pressing
his
hand
cordially
i
wish
i
could
see
you
past
your
monsieur
de
funcal

papers
will
be
delivered
to
us
and
henri
bourignard
will
be
dead
forever
said
ferragus
those
fatal
marks
which
have
cost
us
so
dear
no
longer
exist
i
shall
become
once
more
a
social
being
a

cried
the
convict

it
ida

capable
of
everything
after
the
scene
of
last
night
if
she
should
throw
herself
into
the
river
i
would
not
fish
her
out
she
knows
the
secret
of
my
name
and
she
ll
keep
it
better
there
but
still
look
after
her
for
she
is
in
her
way
a
good
very
the
stranger
departed
ten
minutes
later
jules
heard
with
a
feverish
shudder
the
rustle
of
a
silk
gown
and
almost
recognized
by
their
sound
the
steps
of
his
wife
well
father
said
clemence

poor
father

you
better

courage
you
have
shown

my
child

ferragus
holding
out
his
hand
to
her
clemence
held
her
forehead
to
him
and
he
kissed
it
now
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
my
little
girl
what
are
these
new
troubles
troubles
father
it
concerns
the
life
or
death
of
the
daughter
you
have
loved
so
much
indeed
you
must
as
i
wrote
you
yesterday
you
find
a
way
to
see
my
poor
jules
if
you
knew
how
good
he
has
been
to
me
in
spite
of
all
suspicions
apparently
so
legitimate
father
my
love
is
my
very
life
would
you
see
me
die
ah
i
have
suffered
so
much
that
my
life
i
feel
it
is
in
and
all
because
of
the
curiosity
of
that
miserable
parisian
cried
ferragus
i
d
burn
paris
down
if
i
lost
you
my
daughter
ha
you
may
know
what
a
lover
is
but
you
don
t
yet
know
what
a
father
can
father
you
frighten
me
when
you
look
at
me
in
that
way
don
t
weigh
such
different
feelings
in
the
same
scales
i
had
a
husband
before
i
knew
that
my
father
was
living
if
your
husband
was
the
first
to
lay
kisses
on
your
forehead
i
was
the
first
to
drop
tears
upon
it
replied
ferragus
but
don
t
feel
frightened
clemence
speak
to
me
frankly
i
love
you
enough
to
rejoice
in
the
knowledge
that
you
are
happy
though
i
your
father
may
have
little
place
in
your
heart
while
you
fill
the
whole
of
ah
what
good
such
words
do
me
you
make
me
love
you
more
and
more
though
i
seem
to
rob
something
from
my
jules
but
my
kind
father
think
what
his
sufferings
are
what
may
i
tell
him
my
child
do
you
think
i
waited
for
your
letter
to
save
you
from
this
threatened
danger
do
you
know
what
will
become
of
those
who
venture
to
touch
your
happiness
or
come
between
us
have
you
never
been
aware
that
a
second
providence
was
guarding
your
life
twelve
men
of
power
and
intellect
form
a
phalanx
round
your
love
and
your
existence
ready
to
do
all
things
to
protect
you
think
of
your
father
who
has
risked
death
to
meet
you
in
the
public
promenades
or
see
you
asleep
in
your
little
bed
in
your
mother
s
home
during
the
could
such
a
father
to
whom
your
innocent
caresses
give
strength
to
live
when
a
man
of
honor
ought
to
have
died
to
escape
his
infamy
could
in
short
i
who
breathe
through
your
lips
and
see
with
your
eyes
and
feel
with
your
heart
could
i
fail
to
defend
with
the
claws
of
a
lion
and
the
soul
of
a
father
my
only
blessing
my
life
my
daughter
since
the
death
of
that
angel
your
mother
i
have
dreamed
but
of
one
thing
the
happiness
of
pressing
you
to
my
heart
in
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
of
burying
the
convict
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
of
giving
you
a
father
a
father
who
could
press
without
shame
your
husband
s
hand
who
could
live
without
fear
in
both
your
hearts
who
could
say
to
all
the
world
this
is
my
daughter
in
short
to
be
a
happy
oh
father
father
after
infinite
difficulty
after
searching
the
whole
globe
continued
ferragus
my
friends
have
found
me
the
skin
of
a
dead
man
in
which
to
take
my
place
once
more
in
social
life
a
few
days
hence
i
shall
be
monsieur
de
funcal
a
portuguese
count
ah
my
dear
child
there
are
few
men
of
my
age
who
would
have
had
the
patience
to
learn
portuguese
and
english
which
were
spoken
fluently
by
that
devil
of
a
sailor
who
was
drowned
at
but
my
dear
father
all
has
been
foreseen
and
prepared
a
few
days
hence
his
majesty
john
king
of
portugal
will
be
my
accomplice
my
child
you
must
have
a
little
patience
where
your
father
has
had
so
much
but
ah
what
would
i
not
do
to
reward
your
devotion
for
the
last
three
years
coming
religiously
to
comfort
your
old
father
at
the
risk
of
your
own
peace
father
cried
clemence
taking
his
hands
and
kissing
them
come
my
child
have
courage
still
keep
my
fatal
secret
a
few
days
longer
till
the
end
is
reached
jules
is
not
an
ordinary
man
i
know
but
are
we
sure
that
his
lofty
character
and
his
noble
love
may
not
impel
him
to
dislike
the
daughter
of
a
oh
cried
clemence
you
have
read
my
heart
i
have
no
other
fear
than
that
the
very
thought
turns
me
to
ice
she
added
in
a
tone
but
father
think
that
i
have
promised
him
the
truth
in
two
if
so
my
daughter
tell
him
to
go
to
the
portuguese
embassy
and
see
the
comte
de
funcal
your
father
i
will
be
but
monsieur
de
maulincour
has
told
him
of
ferragus
oh
father
what
torture
to
deceive
deceive
deceive
need
you
say
that
to
me
but
only
a
few
days
more
and
no
living
man
will
be
able
to
expose
me
besides
monsieur
de
maulincour
is
beyond
the
faculty
of
remembering
come
dry
your
tears
my
silly
child
and
think
at
this
instant
a
terrible
cry
rang
from
the
room
in
which
jules
desmarets
was
stationed
the
clamor
was
heard
by
madame
jules
and
ferragus
through
the
opening
of
the
wall
and
struck
them
with
terror
go
and
see
what
it
means
clemence
said
her
father
clemence
ran
rapidly
down
the
little
staircase
found
the
door
into
madame
gruget
s
apartment
wide
open
heard
the
cries
which
echoed
from
the
upper
floor
went
up
the
stairs
guided
by
the
noise
of
sobs
and
caught
these
words
before
she
entered
the
fatal
chamber
you
monsieur
you
with
your
horrid
inventions
you
are
the
cause
of
her
death
hush
miserable
woman
replied
jules
putting
his
handkerchief
on
the
mouth
of
the
old
woman
who
began
at
once
to
cry
out
murder
help
at
this
instant
clemence
entered
saw
her
husband
uttered
a
cry
and
fled
away
who
will
save
my
child
cried
the
widow
gruget
you
have
murdered
how
asked
jules
mechanically
for
he
was
at
being
seen
by
his
wife
read
that
said
the
old
woman
giving
him
a
letter
can
money
or
annuities

me
for
that
farewell
mother
i
bequeeth
you
what
i
have
i
beg
your
pardon
for

forlts
and
the
last
greef

ending
my
life
in
the
river
henry
who
i
love
more
than
myself
says
i
have
made
his
misfortune
and
as
he
has
drifen
me
away
and
i
have
lost
all
my
hops
of
merrying

i
am
going
to

neuilly
so
that
they

after
i

ded
ask
him

berry
a
pore
girl
whose
hart
beet

and
to
forgif
me
for
i
did
rong
to
meddle
in
what
didn
t
consern
me
tak
care
of
his
wounds
how
much
he
sufered
pore
fellow
i
shall
have
as
much
corage
to
kill

as
he
had
to
burn
his
bak
carry
home
the
corsets
i
have
finished
and
pray
god
for
your
daughter
ida
take
this
letter
to
monsieur
de
funcal
who
is
upstairs
said
jules
he
alone
can
save
your
daughter
if
there
is
still
so
saying
he
disappeared
running
like
a
man
who
has
committed
a
crime
his
legs
trembled
the
hot
blood
poured
into
his
swelling
heart
in
torrents
greater
than
at
any
other
moment
of
his
life
and
left
it
again
with
untold
violence
conflicting
thoughts
struggled
in
his
mind
and
yet
one
thought
predominated
he
had
not
been
loyal
to
the
being
he
loved
most
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
argue
with
his
conscience
whose
voice
rising
high
with
conviction
came
like
an
echo
of
those
inward
cries
of
his
love
during
the
cruel
hours
of
doubt
he
had
lately
lived
through
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
wandering
about
paris
for
he
dared
not
go
home
this
man
of
integrity
and
honor
feared
to
meet
the
spotless
brow
of
the
woman
he
had
misjudged
we
estimate
wrongdoing
in
proportion
to
the
purity
of
our
conscience
the
deed
which
is
scarcely
a
fault
in
some
hearts
takes
the
proportions
of
a
crime
in
certain
unsullied
souls
the
slightest
stain
on
the
white
garment
of
a
virgin
makes
it
a
thing
ignoble
as
the
rags
of
a
mendicant
between
the
two
the
difference
lies
in
the
misfortune
of
the
one
the
of
the
other
god
never
measures
repentance
he
never
apportions
it
as
much
is
needed
to
efface
a
spot
as
to
obliterate
the
crimes
of
a
lifetime
these
reflections
fell
with
all
their
weight
on
jules
passions
like
human
laws
will
not
pardon
and
their
reasoning
is
more
just
for
are
they
not
based
upon
a
conscience
of
their
own
as
infallible
as
an
instinct
jules
finally
came
home
pale
despondent
crushed
beneath
a
sense
of
his
and
yet
expressing
in
spite
of
himself
the
joy
his
wife
s
innocence
had
given
him
he
entered
her
room
all
throbbing
with
emotion
she
was
in
bed
with
a
high
fever
he
took
her
hand
kissed
it
and
covered
it
with
tears
dear
angel
he
said
when
they
were
alone
it
is
and
for
what
she
answered
as
she
made
that
reply
she
laid
her
head
back
upon
the
pillow
closed
her
eyes
and
remained
motionless
keeping
the
secret
of
her
sufferings
that
she
might
not
frighten
her
husband
the
tenderness
of
a
mother
the
delicacy
of
an
angel
all
the
woman
was
in
her
answer
the
silence
lasted
long
jules
thinking
her
asleep
went
to
question
josephine
as
to
her
mistress
s
condition
madame
came
home
monsieur
we
sent
at
once
for
monsieur
did
he
come
what
did
he
say
he
said
nothing
monsieur
he
did
not
seem
satisfied
gave
orders
that
no
one
should
go
near
madame
except
the
nurse
and
said
he
should
come
back
this
jules
returned
softly
to
his
wife
s
room
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
before
the
bed
there
he
remained
motionless
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
those
of
clemence
when
she
raised
her
eyelids
she
saw
him
and
through
those
lids
passed
a
tender
glance
full
of
passionate
love
free
from
reproach
and
bitterness
a
look
which
fell
like
a
flame
of
fire
upon
the
heart
of
that
husband
nobly
absolved
and
forever
loved
by
the
being
whom
he
had
killed
the
presentiment
of
death
struck
both
their
minds
with
equal
force
their
looks
were
blended
in
one
anguish
as
their
hearts
had
long
been
blended
in
one
love
felt
equally
by
both
and
shared
equally
no
questions
were
uttered
a
horrible
certainty
was
there
in
the
wife
an
absolute
generosity
in
the
husband
an
awful
remorse
then
in
both
souls
the
same
vision
of
the
end
the
same
conviction
of
fatality
there
came
a
moment
when
thinking
his
wife
asleep
jules
kissed
her
softly
on
the
forehead
then
after
long
contemplation
of
that
cherished
face
he
said
oh
god
leave
me
this
angel
still
a
little
while
that
i
may
blot
out
my
wrong
by
love
and
adoration
as
a
daughter
she
is
sublime
as
a
wife
what
word
can
express
her
clemence
raised
her
eyes
they
were
full
of
tears
you
pain
me
she
said
in
a
feeble
voice
it
was
getting
late
doctor
haudry
came
and
requested
the
husband
to
withdraw
during
his
visit
when
the
doctor
left
the
jules
asked
him
no
question
one
gesture
was
enough
call
in
consultation
any
physician
in
whom
you
place
confidence
i
may
be
doctor
tell
me
the
truth
i
am
a
man
and
i
can
bear
it
besides
i
have
the
deepest
interest
in
knowing
it
i
have
certain
affairs
to
madame
jules
is
dying
said
the
physician
there
is
some
moral
malady
which
has
made
great
progress
and
it
has
complicated
her
physical
condition
which
was
already
dangerous
and
made
still
more
so
by
her
great
imprudence
to
walk
about
barefooted
at
night
to
go
out
when
i
forbade
it
on
foot
yesterday
in
the
rain
in
a
carriage
she
must
have
meant
to
kill
herself
but
still
my
judgment
is
not
final
she
has
youth
and
a
most
amazing
nervous
strength
it
may
be
best
to
risk
all
to
win
all
by
employing
some
violent
reagent
but
i
will
not
take
upon
myself
to
order
it
nor
will
i
advise
it
in
consultation
i
shall
oppose
jules
returned
to
his
wife
for
eleven
days
and
eleven
nights
he
remained
beside
her
bed
taking
no
sleep
during
the
day
when
he
laid
his
head
upon
the
foot
of
the
bed
no
man
ever
pushed
the
jealousy
of
care
and
the
craving
for
devotion
to
such
an
extreme
as
he
he
could
not
endure
that
the
slightest
service
should
be
done
by
others
for
his
wife
there
were
days
of
uncertainty
false
hopes
now
a
little
better
then
a
crisis
in
short
all
the
horrible
mutations
of
death
as
it
wavers
hesitates
and
finally
strikes
madame
jules
always
found
strength
to
smile
at
her
husband
she
pitied
him
knowing
that
soon
he
would
be
alone
it
was
a
double
death
that
of
life
that
of
love
but
life
grew
feebler
and
love
grew
mightier
one
frightful
night
there
was
when
clemence
passed
through
that
delirium
which
precedes
the
death
of
youth
she
talked
of
her
happy
love
she
talked
of
her
father
she
related
her
mother
s
revelations
on
her
and
the
obligations
that
mother
had
laid
upon
her
she
struggled
not
for
life
but
for
her
love
which
she
could
not
leave
grant
o
god
she
said
that
he
may
not
know
i
want
him
to
die
with
jules
unable
to
bear
the
scene
was
at
that
moment
in
the
adjoining
room
and
did
not
hear
the
prayer
which
he
would
doubtless
have
fulfilled
when
this
crisis
was
over
madame
jules
recovered
some
strength
the
next
day
she
was
beautiful
and
tranquil
hope
seemed
to
come
to
her
she
adorned
herself
as
the
dying
often
do
then
she
asked
to
be
alone
all
day
and
sent
away
her
husband
with
one
of
those
entreaties
made
so
earnestly
that
they
are
granted
as
we
grant
the
prayer
of
a
little
child
jules
indeed
had
need
of
this
day
he
went
to
monsieur
de
maulincour
to
demand
the
satisfaction
agreed
upon
between
them
it
was
not
without
great
difficulty
that
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
presence
of
the
author
of
these
misfortunes
but
the
vidame
when
he
learned
that
the
visit
related
to
an
affair
of
honor
obeyed
the
precepts
of
his
whole
life
and
himself
took
jules
into
the
baron
s
chamber
monsieur
desmarets
looked
about
him
in
search
of
his
antagonist
yes
that
is
really
he
said
the
vidame
motioning
to
a
man
who
was
sitting
in
an
beside
the
fire
who
is
it
jules
said
the
dying
man
in
a
broken
voice
auguste
had
lost
the
only
faculty
that
makes
us
live
memory
jules
desmarets
recoiled
with
horror
at
this
sight
he
could
not
even
recognize
the
elegant
young
man
in
that
thing
without
as
bossuet
said
a
name
in
any
language
it
was
in
truth
a
corpse
with
whitened
hair
its
bones
scarce
covered
with
a
wrinkled
blighted
withered
skin
a
corpse
with
white
eyes
motionless
mouth
hideously
gaping
like
those
of
idiots
or
vicious
men
killed
by
excesses
no
trace
of
intelligence
remained
upon
that
brow
nor
in
any
feature
nor
was
there
in
that
flabby
flesh
either
color
or
the
faintest
appearance
of
circulating
blood
here
was
a
shrunken
withered
creature
brought
to
the
state
of
those
monsters
we
see
preserved
in
museums
floating
in
alchohol
jules
fancied
that
he
saw
above
that
face
the
terrible
head
of
ferragus
and
his
own
anger
was
silenced
by
such
a
vengeance
the
husband
found
pity
in
his
heart
for
the
vacant
wreck
of
what
was
once
a
man
the
duel
has
taken
place
said
the
vidame
but
he
has
killed
many
answered
jules
sorrowfully
and
many
dear
ones
added
the
old
man
his
grandmother
is
dying
and
i
shall
follow
her
soon
into
the
on
the
morrow
of
this
day
madame
jules
grew
worse
from
hour
to
hour
she
used
a
moment
s
strength
to
take
a
letter
from
beneath
her
pillow
and
gave
it
eagerly
to
her
husband
with
a
sign
that
was
easy
to
understand
she
wished
to
give
him
in
a
kiss
her
last
breath
he
took
it
and
she
died
jules
fell
himself
and
was
taken
to
his
brother
s
house
there
as
he
deplored
in
tears
his
absence
of
the
day
before
his
brother
told
him
that
this
separation
was
eagerly
desired
by
clemence
who
wished
to
spare
him
the
sight
of
the
religious
paraphernalia
so
terrible
to
tender
imaginations
which
the
church
displays
when
conferring
the
last
sacraments
upon
the
dying
you
could
not
have
borne
it
said
his
brother
i
could
hardly
bear
the
sight
myself
and
all
the
servants
wept
clemence
was
like
a
saint
she
gathered
strength
to
bid
us
all
and
that
voice
heard
for
the
last
time
rent
our
hearts
when
she
asked
pardon
for
the
pain
she
might
unwillingly
have
caused
her
servants
there
were
cries
and
sobs
and
enough
enough
said
jules
he
wanted
to
be
alone
that
he
might
read
the
last
words
of
the
woman
whom
all
had
loved
and
who
had
passed
away
like
a
flower
my
beloved
this
is
my
last
will
why
should
we
not
make
wills
for
the
treasures
of
our
hearts
as
for
our
worldly
property
was
not
my
love
my
property
my
all
i
mean
here
to
dispose
of
my
love
it
was
the
only
fortune
of
your
clemence
and
it
is
all
that
she
can
leave
you
in
dying
jules
you
love
me
still
and
i
die
happy
the
doctors
may
explain
my
death
as
they
think
best
i
alone
know
the
true
cause
i
shall
tell
it
to
you
whatever
pain
it
may
cause
you
i
can
not
carry
with
me
in
a
heart
all
yours
a
secret
which
you
do
not
share
although
i
die
the
victim
of
an
enforced
silence
jules
i
was
nurtured
and
brought
up
in
the
deepest
solitude
far
from
the
vices
and
the
falsehoods
of
the
world
by
the
loving
woman
whom
you
knew
society
did
justice
to
her
conventional
charm
for
that
is
what
pleases
society
but
i
knew
secretly
her
precious
soul
i
could
cherish
the
mother
who
made
my
childhood
a
joy
without
bitterness
and
i
knew
why
i
cherished
her
was
not
that
to
love
doubly
yes
i
loved
her
i
feared
her
i
respected
her
yet
nothing
oppressed
my
heart
neither
fear
nor
respect
i
was
all
in
all
to
her
she
was
all
in
all
to
me
for
nineteen
happy
years
without
a
care
my
soul
solitary
amid
the
world
which
muttered
round
me
reflected
only
her
pure
image
my
heart
beat
for
her
and
through
her
i
was
scrupulously
pious
i
found
pleasure
in
being
innocent
before
god
my
mother
cultivated
all
noble
and
sentiments
in
me
ah
it
gives
me
happiness
to
tell
you
jules
that
i
now
know
i
was
indeed
a
young
girl
and
that
i
came
to
you
virgin
in
heart
when
i
left
that
absolute
solitude
when
for
the
first
time
i
braided
my
hair
and
crowned
it
with
almond
blossoms
when
i
added
with
delight
a
few
satin
knots
to
my
white
dress
thinking
of
the
world
i
was
to
see
and
which
i
was
curious
to
see
jules
that
innocent
and
modest
coquetry
was
done
for
you
yes
as
i
entered
the
world
i
saw
first
of
all
your
face
i
remarked
it
it
stood
out
from
the
rest
your
person
pleased
me
your
voice
your
manners
all
inspired
me
with
pleasant
presentiments
when
you
came
up
when
you
spoke
to
me
the
color
on
your
forehead
the
tremble
in
your
voice
that
moment
gave
me
memories
with
which
i
throb
as
i
now
write
to
you
as
i
now
for
the
last
time
think
of
them
our
love
was
at
first
the
keenest
of
sympathies
but
it
was
soon
discovered
by
each
of
us
and
then
as
speedily
shared
just
as
in
after
times
we
have
both
equally
felt
and
shared
innumerable
happinesses
from
that
moment
my
mother
was
only
second
in
my
heart
next
i
was
yours
all
yours
there
is
my
life
and
all
my
life
dear
husband
and
here
is
what
remains
for
me
to
tell
you
one
evening
a
few
days
before
my
mother
s
death
she
revealed
to
me
the
secret
of
her
life
not
without
burning
tears
i
have
loved
you
better
since
the
day
i
learned
from
the
priest
as
he
absolved
my
mother
that
there
are
passions
condemned
by
the
world
and
by
the
church
but
surely
god
will
not
be
severe
when
they
are
the
sins
of
souls
as
tender
as
that
of
my
mother
only
that
dear
woman
could
never
bring
herself
to
repent
she
loved
much
jules
she
was
all
love
so
i
have
prayed
daily
for
her
but
never
judged
her
that
night
i
learned
the
cause
of
her
deep
maternal
tenderness
then
i
also
learned
that
there
was
in
paris
a
man
whose
life
and
whose
love
centred
on
me
that
your
fortune
was
his
doing
and
that
he
loved
you
i
learned
also
that
he
was
exiled
from
society
and
bore
a
tarnished
name
but
that
he
was
more
unhappy
for
me
for
us
than
for
himself
my
mother
was
all
his
comfort
she
was
dying
and
i
promised
to
take
her
place
with
all
the
ardor
of
a
soul
whose
feelings
had
never
been
perverted
i
saw
only
the
happiness
of
softening
the
bitterness
of
my
mother
s
last
moments
and
i
pledged
myself
to
continue
her
work
of
secret
charity
the
charity
of
the
heart
the
first
time
that
i
saw
my
father
was
beside
the
bed
where
my
mother
had
just
expired
when
he
raised
his
tearful
eyes
it
was
to
see
in
me
a
revival
of
his
dead
hopes
i
had
sworn
not
to
tell
a
lie
but
to
keep
silence
and
that
silence
what
woman
could
have
broken
it
there
is
my
fault
jules
a
fault
which
i
expiate
by
death
i
doubted
you
but
fear
is
so
natural
to
a
woman
above
all
a
woman
who
knows
what
it
is
that
she
may
lose
i
trembled
for
our
love
my
father
s
secret
seemed
to
me
the
death
of
my
happiness
and
the
more
i
loved
the
more
i
feared
i
dared
not
avow
this
feeling
to
my
father
it
would
have
wounded
him
and
in
his
situation
a
wound
was
agony
but
without
a
word
from
me
he
shared
my
fears
that
fatherly
heart
trembled
for
my
happiness
as
much
as
i
trembled
for
myself
but
it
dared
not
speak
obeying
the
same
delicacy
that
kept
me
mute
yes
jules
i
believed
that
you
could
not
love
the
daughter
of
gratien
bourignard
as
you
loved
your
clemence
without
that
terror
could
i
have
kept
back
anything
from
you
you
who
live
in
every
fold
of
my
heart
the
day
when
that
odious
unfortunate
young
officer
spoke
to
you
i
was
forced
to
lie
that
day
for
the
second
time
in
my
life
i
knew
what
pain
was
that
pain
has
steadily
increased
until
this
moment
when
i
speak
with
you
for
the
last
time
what
matters
now
my
father
s
position
you
know
all
i
could
by
the
help
of
my
love
have
conquered
my
illness
and
borne
its
sufferings
but
i
can
not
stifle
the
voice
of
doubt
is
it
not
probable
that
my
origin
would
affect
the
purity
of
your
love
and
weaken
it
diminish
it
that
fear
nothing
has
been
able
to
quench
in
me
there
jules
is
the
cause
of
my
death
i
can
not
live
fearing
a
word
a
look
a
word
you
may
never
say
a
look
you
may
never
give
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
fear
them
i
die
beloved
there
is
my
consolation
i
have
known
for
the
last
three
years
that
my
father
and
his
friends
have
moved
the
world
to
deceive
the
world
that
i
might
have
a
station
in
life
they
have
bought
a
dead
man
a
reputation
a
fortune
so
that
a
living
man
might
live
again
restored
and
all
this
for
you
for
us
we
were
never
to
have
known
of
it
well
my
death
will
save
my
father
from
that
falsehood
for
he
will
not
survive
me
farewell
jules
my
heart
is
all
here
to
show
you
my
love
in
its
agony
of
fear
is
not
that
bequeathing
my
whole
soul
to
you
i
could
never
have
the
strength
to
speak
to
you
i
have
only
enough
to
write
i
have
just
confessed
to
god
the
sins
of
my
life
i
have
promised
to
fill
my
mind
with
the
king
of
heaven
only
but
i
must
confess
to
him
who
is
for
me
the
whole
of
earth
alas
shall
i
not
be
pardoned
for
this
last
sigh
between
the
life
that
was
and
the
life
that
shall
be
farewell
my
jules
my
loved
one
i
go
to
god
with
whom
is
love
without
a
cloud
to
whom
you
will
follow
me
there
before
his
throne
united
forever
we
may
love
each
other
throughout
the
ages
this
hope
alone
can
comfort
me
if
i
am
worthy
of
being
there
at
once
i
will
follow
you
through
life
my
soul
shall
bear
your
company
it
will
wrap
you
about
for
must
stay
here
still
ah
here
below
lead
a
holy
life
that
you
may
the
more
surely
come
to
me
you
can
do
such
good
upon
this
earth
is
it
not
an
angel
s
mission
for
the
suffering
soul
to
shed
happiness
about
him
to
give
to
others
that
which
he
has
not
i
bequeath
you
to
the
unhappy
their
smiles
their
tears
are
the
only
ones
of
which
i
can
not
be
jealous
we
shall
find
a
charm
in
sweet
beneficence
can
we
not
live
together
still
if
you
would
join
my
name
your
clemence
in
these
good
works
after
loving
as
we
have
loved
there
is
naught
but
god
jules
god
does
not
lie
god
never
betrays
adore
him
only
i
charge
you
lead
those
who
suffer
up
to
him
comfort
the
sorrowing
members
of
his
church
farewell
dear
soul
that
i
have
filled
i
know
you
you
will
never
love
again
i
may
die
happy
in
the
thought
that
makes
all
women
happy
yes
my
grave
will
be
your
heart
after
this
childhood
i
have
just
related
has
not
my
life
flowed
on
within
that
heart
dead
you
will
never
drive
me
forth
i
am
proud
of
that
rare
life
you
will
know
me
only
in
the
flower
of
my
youth
i
leave
you
regrets
without
disillusions
jules
it
is
a
happy
death
you
who
have
so
fully
understood
me
may
i
ask
one
thing
more
of
you
superfluous
request
perhaps
the
fulfilment
of
a
woman
s
fancy
the
prayer
of
a
jealousy
we
all
must
feel
i
pray
you
to
burn
all
that
especially
belonged
to
destroy
our
chamber
annihilate
all
that
is
a
memory
of
our
happiness
once
more
farewell
the
last
farewell
it
is
all
love
and
so
will
be
my
parting
thought
my
parting
when
jules
had
read
that
letter
there
came
into
his
heart
one
of
those
wild
frenzies
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
awful
anguish
all
sorrows
are
individual
their
effects
are
not
subjected
to
any
fixed
rule
certain
men
will
stop
their
ears
to
hear
nothing
some
women
close
their
eyes
hoping
never
to
see
again
great
and
splendid
souls
are
met
with
who
fling
themselves
into
sorrow
as
into
an
abyss
in
the
matter
of
despair
all
is
true
chapter
conclusion
jules
escaped
from
his
brother
s
house
and
returned
home
wishing
to
pass
the
night
beside
his
wife
and
see
till
the
last
moment
that
celestial
creature
as
he
walked
along
with
an
indifference
to
life
known
only
to
those
who
have
reached
the
last
degree
of
wretchedness
he
thought
of
how
in
india
the
law
ordained
that
widows
should
die
he
longed
to
die
he
was
not
yet
crushed
the
fever
of
his
grief
was
still
upon
him
he
reached
his
home
and
went
up
into
the
sacred
chamber
he
saw
his
clemence
on
the
bed
of
death
beautiful
like
a
saint
her
hair
smoothly
laid
upon
her
forehead
her
hands
joined
her
body
wrapped
already
in
its
shroud
tapers
were
lighted
a
priest
was
praying
josephine
kneeling
in
a
corner
wept
and
near
the
bed
were
two
men
one
was
ferragus
he
stood
erect
motionless
gazing
at
his
daughter
with
dry
eyes
his
head
you
might
have
taken
for
bronze
he
did
not
see
jules
the
other
man
was
jacquet
jacquet
to
whom
madame
jules
had
been
ever
kind
jacquet
felt
for
her
one
of
those
respectful
friendships
which
rejoice
the
untroubled
heart
a
gentle
passion
love
without
its
desires
and
its
storms
he
had
come
to
pay
his
debt
of
tears
to
bid
a
long
adieu
to
the
wife
of
his
friend
to
kiss
for
the
first
time
the
icy
brow
of
the
woman
he
had
tacitly
made
his
sister
all
was
silence
here
death
was
neither
terrible
as
in
the
churches
nor
pompous
as
it
makes
its
way
along
the
streets
no
it
was
death
in
the
home
a
tender
death
here
were
pomps
of
the
heart
tears
drawn
from
the
eyes
of
all
jules
sat
down
beside
jacquet
and
pressed
his
hand
then
without
uttering
a
word
all
these
persons
remained
as
they
were
till
morning
when
daylight
paled
the
tapers
jacquet
foreseeing
the
painful
scenes
which
would
then
take
place
drew
jules
away
into
another
room
at
this
moment
the
husband
looked
at
the
father
and
ferragus
looked
at
jules
the
two
sorrows
arraigned
each
other
measured
each
other
and
comprehended
each
other
in
that
look
a
flash
of
fury
shone
for
an
instant
in
the
eyes
of
ferragus
you
killed
her
thought
he
why
was
i
distrusted
seemed
the
answer
of
the
husband
the
scene
was
one
that
might
have
passed
between
two
tigers
recognizing
the
futility
of
a
struggle
and
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
turning
away
without
even
a
roar
jacquet
said
jules
have
you
attended
to
everything
yes
to
everything
replied
his
friend
but
a
man
had
forestalled
me
who
had
ordered
and
paid
for
he
tears
his
daughter
from
me
cried
the
husband
with
the
violence
of
despair
jules
rushed
back
to
his
wife
s
room
but
the
father
was
there
no
longer
clemence
had
now
been
placed
in
a
leaden
coffin
and
workmen
were
employed
in
soldering
the
cover
jules
returned
horrified
by
the
sight
the
sound
of
the
hammers
the
men
were
using
made
him
mechanically
burst
into
tears
jacquet
he
said
out
of
this
dreadful
night
one
idea
has
come
to
me
only
one
but
one
i
must
make
a
reality
at
any
price
i
can
not
let
clemence
stay
in
any
cemetery
in
paris
i
wish
to
burn
her
to
gather
her
ashes
and
keep
her
with
me
say
nothing
of
this
but
manage
on
my
behalf
to
have
it
done
i
am
going
to
chamber
where
i
shall
stay
until
the
time
has
come
to
go
you
alone
may
come
in
there
to
tell
me
what
you
have
done
go
and
spare
during
the
morning
madame
jules
after
lying
in
a
mortuary
chapel
at
the
door
of
her
house
was
taken
to
the
church
was
hung
with
black
throughout
the
sort
of
luxury
thus
displayed
had
drawn
a
crowd
for
in
paris
all
things
are
sights
even
true
grief
there
are
people
who
stand
at
their
windows
to
see
how
a
son
deplores
a
mother
as
he
follows
her
body
there
are
others
who
hire
commodious
seats
to
see
how
a
head
is
made
to
fall
no
people
in
the
world
have
such
insatiate
eyes
as
the
parisians
on
this
occasion
inquisitive
minds
were
particularly
surprised
to
see
the
six
lateral
chapels
at
also
hung
in
black
two
men
in
mourning
were
listening
to
a
mortuary
mass
said
in
each
chapel
in
the
chancel
no
other
persons
but
monsieur
desmarets
the
notary
and
jacquet
were
present
the
servants
of
the
household
were
outside
the
screen
to
church
loungers
there
was
something
inexplicable
in
so
much
pomp
and
so
few
mourners
but
jules
had
been
determined
that
no
indifferent
persons
should
be
present
at
the
ceremony
high
mass
was
celebrated
with
the
sombre
magnificence
of
funeral
services
beside
the
ministers
in
ordinary
of
thirteen
priests
from
other
parishes
were
present
perhaps
never
did
the
produce
upon
christians
assembled
by
chance
by
curiosity
and
thirsting
for
emotions
an
effect
so
profound
so
nervously
glacial
as
that
now
caused
by
this
hymn
when
the
eight
voices
of
the
precentors
accompanied
by
the
voices
of
the
priests
and
the
intoned
it
alternately
from
the
six
lateral
chapels
twelve
other
childish
voices
rose
shrilly
in
grief
mingling
with
the
choir
voices
lamentably
from
all
parts
of
the
church
this
mourning
issued
cries
of
anguish
responded
to
the
cries
of
fear
that
terrible
music
was
the
voice
of
sorrows
hidden
from
the
world
of
secret
friendships
weeping
for
the
dead
never
in
any
human
religion
have
the
terrors
of
the
soul
violently
torn
from
the
body
and
stormily
shaken
in
presence
of
the
fulminating
majesty
of
god
been
rendered
with
such
force
before
that
clamor
of
clamors
all
artists
and
their
most
passionate
compositions
must
bow
humiliated
no
nothing
can
stand
beside
that
hymn
which
sums
all
human
passions
gives
them
a
galvanic
life
beyond
the
coffin
and
leaves
them
palpitating
still
before
the
living
and
avenging
god
these
cries
of
childhood
mingling
with
the
tones
of
older
voices
including
thus
in
the
song
of
death
all
human
life
and
its
developments
recalling
the
sufferings
of
the
cradle
swelling
to
the
griefs
of
other
ages
in
the
stronger
male
voices
and
the
quavering
of
the
priests
all
this
strident
harmony
big
with
lightning
and
thunderbolts
does
it
not
speak
with
equal
force
to
the
daring
imagination
the
coldest
heart
nay
to
philosophers
themselves
as
we
hear
it
we
think
god
speaks
the
vaulted
arches
of
no
church
are
mere
material
they
have
a
voice
they
tremble
they
scatter
fear
by
the
might
of
their
echoes
we
think
we
see
unnumbered
dead
arising
and
holding
out
their
hands
it
is
no
more
a
father
a
wife
a
child
humanity
itself
is
rising
from
its
dust
it
is
impossible
to
judge
of
the
catholic
apostolic
and
roman
faith
unless
the
soul
has
known
that
deepest
grief
of
mourning
for
a
loved
one
lying
beneath
the
pall
unless
it
has
felt
the
emotions
that
fill
the
heart
uttered
by
that
hymn
of
despair
by
those
cries
that
crush
the
mind
by
that
sacred
fear
augmenting
strophe
by
strophe
ascending
heavenward
which
terrifies
belittles
and
elevates
the
soul
and
leaves
within
our
minds
as
the
last
sound
ceases
a
consciousness
of
immortality
we
have
met
and
struggled
with
the
vast
idea
of
the
infinite
after
that
all
is
silent
in
the
church
no
word
is
said
sceptics
themselves
not
what
they
are
spanish
genius
alone
was
able
to
bring
this
untold
majesty
to
untold
griefs
when
the
solemn
ceremony
was
over
twelve
men
came
from
the
six
chapels
and
stood
around
the
coffin
to
hear
the
song
of
hope
which
the
church
intones
for
the
christian
soul
before
the
human
form
is
buried
then
each
man
entered
alone
a
jacquet
and
monsieur
desmarets
took
the
thirteenth
the
servants
followed
on
foot
an
hour
later
they
were
at
the
summit
of
that
cemetery
popularly
called
the
unknown
twelve
men
stood
in
a
circle
round
the
grave
where
the
coffin
had
been
laid
in
presence
of
a
crowd
of
loiterers
gathered
from
all
parts
of
this
public
garden
after
a
few
short
prayers
the
priest
threw
a
handful
of
earth
on
the
remains
of
this
woman
and
the
having
asked
for
their
fee
made
haste
to
fill
the
grave
in
order
to
dig
another
here
this
history
seems
to
end
but
perhaps
it
would
be
incomplete
if
after
giving
a
rapid
sketch
of
parisian
life
and
following
certain
of
its
capricious
undulations
the
effects
of
death
were
omitted
death
in
paris
is
unlike
death
in
any
other
capital
few
persons
know
the
trials
of
true
grief
in
its
struggle
with
civilization
and
the
government
of
paris
perhaps
also
monsieur
jules
and
ferragus
xxiii
may
have
proved
sufficiently
interesting
to
make
a
few
words
on
their
after
life
not
entirely
out
of
place
besides
some
persons
like
to
be
told
all
and
wish
as
one
of
our
cleverest
critics
has
remarked
to
know
by
what
chemical
process
oil
was
made
to
burn
in
aladdin
s
lamp
jacquet
being
a
government
employee
naturally
applied
to
the
authorities
for
permission
to
exhume
the
body
of
madame
jules
and
burn
it
he
went
to
see
the
prefect
of
police
under
whose
protection
the
dead
sleep
that
functionary
demanded
a
petition
the
blank
was
brought
that
gives
to
sorrow
its
proper
administrative
form
it
was
necessary
to
employ
the
bureaucratic
jargon
to
express
the
wishes
of
a
man
so
crushed
that
words
perhaps
were
lacking
to
him
and
it
was
also
necessary
to
coldly
and
briefly
repeat
on
the
margin
the
nature
of
the
request
which
was
done
in
these
words
the
petitioner
respectfully
asks
for
the
incineration
of
his
when
the
official
charged
with
making
the
report
to
the
councillor
of
state
and
prefect
of
police
read
that
marginal
note
explaining
the
object
of
the
petition
and
couched
as
requested
in
the
plainest
terms
he
said
this
is
a
serious
matter
my
report
can
not
be
ready
under
eight
jules
to
whom
jacquet
was
obliged
to
speak
of
this
delay
comprehended
the
words
that
ferragus
had
said
in
his
hearing
i
ll
burn
paris
nothing
seemed
to
him
now
more
natural
than
to
annihilate
that
receptacle
of
monstrous
things
but
he
said
to
jacquet
you
must
go
to
the
minister
of
the
interior
and
get
your
minister
to
speak
to
jacquet
went
to
the
minister
of
the
interior
and
asked
an
audience
it
was
granted
but
the
time
appointed
was
two
weeks
later
jacquet
was
a
persistent
man
he
travelled
from
bureau
to
bureau
and
finally
reached
the
private
secretary
of
the
minister
of
the
interior
to
whom
he
had
made
the
private
secretary
of
his
own
minister
say
a
word
these
high
protectors
aiding
he
obtained
for
the
morrow
a
second
interview
in
which
being
armed
with
a
line
from
the
autocrat
of
foreign
affairs
to
the
pacha
of
the
interior
jacquet
hoped
to
carry
the
matter
by
assault
he
was
ready
with
reasons
and
answers
to
peremptory
questions
in
short
he
was
armed
at
all
points
but
he
failed
this
matter
does
not
concern
me
said
the
minister
it
belongs
to
the
prefect
of
police
besides
there
is
no
law
giving
a
husband
any
legal
right
to
the
body
of
his
wife
nor
to
fathers
those
of
their
children
the
matter
is
serious
there
are
questions
of
public
utility
involved
which
will
have
to
be
examined
the
interests
of
the
city
of
paris
might
suffer
therefore
if
the
matter
depended
on
me
which
it
does
not
i
could
not
decide
et
i
should
require
a
a
is
to
the
present
system
of
administration
what
limbo
or
hades
is
to
christianity
jacquet
knew
very
well
the
mania
for
reports
he
had
not
waited
until
this
occasion
to
groan
at
that
bureaucratic
absurdity
he
knew
that
since
the
invasion
into
public
business
of
the
an
administrative
revolution
consummated
in
there
was
never
known
a
single
minister
who
would
take
upon
himself
to
have
an
opinion
or
to
decide
the
slightest
matter
unless
that
opinion
or
matter
had
been
winnowed
sifted
and
plucked
to
bits
by
the
and
splendid
intellects
of
his
particular
bureau
jacquet
he
was
one
of
those
who
are
worthy
of
plutarch
as
biographer
saw
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
his
management
of
the
affair
and
had
in
fact
rendered
it
impossible
by
trying
to
proceed
legally
the
thing
he
should
have
done
was
to
have
taken
madame
jules
to
one
of
desmaret
s
estates
in
the
country
and
there
under
the
authority
of
some
village
mayor
to
have
gratified
the
sorrowful
longing
of
his
friend
law
constitutional
and
administrative
begets
nothing
it
is
a
barren
monster
for
peoples
for
kings
and
for
private
interests
but
the
peoples
decipher
no
principles
but
those
that
are
writ
in
blood
and
the
evils
of
legality
will
always
be
pacific
it
flattens
a
nation
down
that
is
all
jacquet
a
man
of
modern
liberty
returned
home
reflecting
on
the
benefits
of
arbitrary
power
when
he
went
with
his
report
to
jules
he
found
it
necessary
to
deceive
him
for
the
unhappy
man
was
in
a
high
fever
unable
to
leave
his
bed
the
minister
of
the
interior
mentioned
at
a
ministerial
dinner
that
same
evening
the
singular
fancy
of
a
parisian
in
wishing
to
burn
his
wife
after
the
manner
of
the
romans
the
clubs
of
paris
took
up
the
subject
and
talked
for
a
while
of
the
burials
of
antiquity
ancient
things
were
just
then
becoming
a
fashion
and
some
persons
declared
that
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
for
distinguished
persons
the
funeral
pyre
this
opinion
had
its
defenders
and
its
detractors
some
said
that
there
were
too
many
such
personages
and
the
price
of
wood
would
be
enormously
increased
by
such
a
custom
moreover
it
would
be
absurd
to
see
our
ancestors
in
their
urns
in
the
procession
at
longchamps
and
if
the
urns
were
valuable
they
were
likely
some
day
to
be
sold
at
auction
full
of
respectable
ashes
or
seized
by
creditors
a
race
of
men
who
respected
nothing
the
other
side
made
answer
that
our
ancestors
were
much
safer
in
urns
than
at
for
before
very
long
the
city
of
paris
would
be
compelled
to
order
a
against
its
dead
who
were
invading
the
neighboring
country
and
threatening
to
invade
the
territory
of
brie
it
was
in
short
one
of
those
futile
but
witty
discussions
which
sometimes
cause
deep
and
painful
wounds
happily
for
jules
he
knew
nothing
of
the
conversations
the
witty
speeches
and
arguments
which
his
sorrow
had
furnished
to
the
tongues
of
paris
the
prefect
of
police
was
indignant
that
monsieur
jacquet
had
appealed
to
a
minister
to
avoid
the
wise
delays
of
the
commissioners
of
the
public
highways
for
the
exhumation
of
madame
jules
was
a
question
belonging
to
that
department
the
police
bureau
was
doing
its
best
to
reply
promptly
to
the
petition
one
appeal
was
quite
sufficient
to
set
the
office
in
motion
and
once
in
motion
matters
would
go
far
but
as
for
the
administration
that
might
take
the
case
before
the
council
of
state
a
machine
very
difficult
indeed
to
move
after
the
second
day
jacquet
was
obliged
to
tell
his
friend
that
he
must
renounce
his
desire
because
in
a
city
where
the
number
of
tears
shed
on
black
draperies
is
tariffed
where
the
laws
recognize
seven
classes
of
funerals
where
the
scrap
of
ground
to
hold
the
dead
is
sold
at
its
weight
in
silver
where
grief
is
worked
for
what
it
is
worth
where
the
prayers
of
the
church
are
costly
and
the
vestry
claim
payment
for
extra
voices
in
the
all
attempt
to
get
out
of
the
rut
prescribed
by
the
authorities
for
sorrow
is
useless
and
impossible
it
would
have
been
to
me
said
jules
a
comfort
in
my
misery
i
meant
to
have
died
away
from
here
and
i
hoped
to
hold
her
in
my
arms
in
a
distant
grave
i
did
not
know
that
bureaucracy
could
send
its
claws
into
our
very
he
now
wished
to
see
if
room
had
been
left
for
him
beside
his
wife
the
two
friends
went
to
the
cemetery
when
they
reached
it
they
found
as
at
the
doors
of
museums
galleries
and
who
proposed
to
guide
them
through
the
labyrinth
of
neither
jules
nor
jacquet
could
have
found
the
spot
where
clemence
lay
ah
frightful
anguish
they
went
to
the
lodge
to
consult
the
porter
of
the
cemetery
the
dead
have
a
porter
and
there
are
hours
when
the
dead
are
not
it
is
necessary
to
upset
all
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
upper
and
lower
police
to
obtain
permission
to
weep
at
night
in
silence
and
solitude
over
the
grave
where
a
loved
one
lies
there
s
a
rule
for
summer
and
a
rule
for
winter
about
this
certainly
of
all
the
porters
in
paris
the
porter
of
is
the
luckiest
in
the
first
place
he
has
no
to
pull
then
instead
of
a
lodge
he
has
a
house
an
establishment
which
is
not
quite
ministerial
although
a
vast
number
of
persons
come
under
his
administration
and
a
good
many
employees
and
this
governor
of
the
dead
has
a
salary
with
emoluments
and
acts
under
powers
of
which
none
complain
he
plays
despot
at
his
ease
his
lodge
is
not
a
place
of
business
though
it
has
departments
where
the
of
receipts
expenses
and
profits
is
carried
on
the
man
is
not
a
nor
a
concierge
nor
actually
a
porter
the
gate
which
admits
the
dead
stands
wide
open
and
though
there
are
monuments
and
buildings
to
be
cared
for
he
is
not
a
in
short
he
is
an
indefinable
anomaly
an
authority
which
participates
in
all
and
yet
is
nothing
an
authority
placed
like
the
dead
on
whom
it
is
based
outside
of
all
nevertheless
this
exceptional
man
grows
out
of
the
city
of
paris
that
chimerical
creation
like
the
ship
which
is
its
emblem
that
creature
of
reason
moving
on
a
thousand
paws
which
are
seldom
unanimous
in
motion
this
guardian
of
the
cemetery
may
be
called
a
concierge
who
has
reached
the
condition
of
a
functionary
not
soluble
by
dissolution
his
place
is
far
from
being
a
sinecure
he
does
not
allow
any
one
to
be
buried
without
a
permit
he
must
count
his
dead
he
points
out
to
you
in
this
vast
field
the
six
feet
square
of
earth
where
you
will
one
day
put
all
you
love
or
all
you
hate
a
mistress
or
a
cousin
yes
remember
this
all
the
feelings
and
emotions
of
paris
come
to
end
here
at
this
porter
s
lodge
where
they
are
administrationized
this
man
has
registers
in
which
his
dead
are
booked
they
are
in
their
graves
and
also
on
his
records
he
has
under
him
keepers
gardeners
and
their
assistants
he
is
a
personage
mourning
hearts
do
not
speak
to
him
at
first
he
does
not
appear
at
all

epitaph
apart
but
so
many
diverse
sentiments
have
passed
before
him
on
biers
he
has
seen
so
many
tears
true
and
false
he
has
beheld
sorrow
under
so
many
aspects
and
on
so
many
faces
he
has
heard
such
endless
thousands
of
eternal
woes
that
to
him
sorrow
has
come
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
stone
an
inch
thick
four
feet
long
and
inches
wide
as
for
regrets
they
are
the
annoyances
of
his
office
he
neither
breakfasts
nor
dines
without
first
wiping
off
the
rain
of
an
inconsolable
affliction
he
is
kind
and
tender
to
other
feelings
he
will
weep
over
a
over
monsieur
germeuil
in
the
auberge
des
adrets
the
man
with
the
breeches
murdered
by
macaire
but
his
heart
is
ossified
in
the
matter
of
real
dead
men
dead
men
are
ciphers
numbers
to
him
it
is
his
business
to
organize
death
yet
he
does
meet
three
times
in
a
century
perhaps
with
an
occasion
when
his
part
becomes
sublime
and
then
he
sublime
through
every
hour
of
his
day
in
times
of
pestilence
when
jacquet
approached
him
this
absolute
monarch
was
evidently
out
of
temper
i
told
you
he
was
saying
to
water
the
flowers
from
the
rue
massena
to
the
place
regnault
de
angely
you
paid
no
attention
to
me
suppose
the
relations
should
take
it
into
their
heads
to
come
here
because
the
weather
is
fine
what
would
they
say
to
me
they
d
shriek
as
if
they
were
burned
they
d
say
horrid
things
of
us
and
calumniate
us
monsieur
said
jacquet
we
want
to
know
where
madame
jules
is
madame
jules
he
asked
we
ve
had
three
madame
jules
within
the
last
week
ah
he
said
interrupting
himself
here
comes
the
funeral
of
monsieur
le
baron
de
maulincour
a
fine
procession
that
he
has
soon
followed
his
grandmother
some
families
when
they
begin
to
go
rattle
down
like
a
wager
lots
of
bad
blood
in
monsieur
said
jacquet
touching
him
on
the
arm
the
person
i
spoke
of
is
madame
jules
desmarets
the
wife
of
the
broker
of
that
ah
i
know
he
replied
looking
at
jacquet
wasn
t
it
a
funeral
with
thirteen
mourning
coaches
and
only
one
mourner
in
the
twelve
first
it
was
so
droll
we
all
noticed
it
monsieur
take
care
monsieur
desmarets
is
with
me
he
might
hear
you
and
what
you
say
is
not
i
beg
pardon
monsieur
you
are
quite
right
excuse
me
i
took
you
for
heirs
monsieur
he
continued
after
consulting
a
plan
of
the
cemetery
madame
jules
is
in
the
rue
marechal
lefebre
alley
no
between
mademoiselle
raucourt
of
the
and
monsieur
a
butcher
for
whom
a
handsome
tomb
in
white
marble
has
been
ordered
which
will
be
one
of
the
finest
in
the
cemetery
monsieur
said
jacquet
interrupting
him
that
does
not
help
true
said
the
official
looking
round
him
jean
he
cried
to
a
man
whom
he
saw
at
a
little
distance
conduct
these
gentlemen
to
the
grave
of
madame
jules
desmarets
the
broker
s
wife
you
know
where
it
is
near
to
mademoiselle
raucourt
the
tomb
where
there
s
a
the
two
friends
followed
the
guide
but
they
did
not
reach
the
steep
path
which
leads
to
the
upper
part
of
the
cemetery
without
having
to
pass
through
a
score
of
proposals
and
requests
made
with
honied
softness
by
the
touts
of
and
monumental
sculptors
if
monsieur
would
like
to
order
we
would
do
it
on
the
most
reasonable
jacquet
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
spare
his
friend
the
hearing
of
these
proposals
so
agonizing
to
bleeding
hearts
and
presently
they
reached
the
when
jules
beheld
the
earth
so
recently
dug
into
which
the
masons
had
stuck
stakes
to
mark
the
place
for
the
stone
posts
required
to
support
the
iron
railing
he
turned
and
leaned
upon
jacquet
s
shoulder
raising
himself
now
and
again
to
cast
long
glances
at
the
clay
mound
where
he
was
forced
to
leave
the
remains
of
the
being
in
and
by
whom
he
still
lived
how
miserably
she
lies
there
he
said
but
she
is
not
there
said
jacquet
she
is
in
your
memory
come
let
us
go
let
us
leave
this
odious
cemetery
where
the
dead
are
adorned
like
women
for
a
suppose
we
take
her
away
can
it
be
done
all
things
can
be
done
cried
jules
so
i
shall
lie
there
he
added
after
a
pause
there
is
room
jacquet
finally
succeeded
in
getting
him
to
leave
the
great
enclosure
divided
like
a
chessboard
by
iron
railings
and
elegant
compartments
in
which
were
tombs
decorated
with
palms
inscriptions
and
tears
as
cold
as
the
stones
on
which
sorrowing
hearts
had
caused
to
be
carved
their
regrets
and
coats
of
arms
many
good
words
are
there
engraved
in
black
letters
epigrams
reproving
the
curious
wittily
turned
farewells
rendezvous
given
at
which
only
one
side
appears
pretentious
biographies
glitter
rubbish
and
tinsel
here
the
floriated
thyrsus
there
a
farther
on
egyptian
urns
now
and
then
a
few
cannon
on
all
sides
the
emblems
of
professions
and
every
style
of
art
moorish
greek
gothic
friezes
ovules
paintings
vases
temples
together
with
innumerable
and
dead
it
is
a
forlorn
comedy
it
is
another
paris
with
its
streets
its
signs
its
industries
and
its
lodgings
but
a
paris
seen
through
the
diminishing
end
of
an
a
microscopic
paris
reduced
to
the
littleness
of
shadows
spectres
dead
men
a
human
race
which
no
longer
has
anything
great
about
it
except
its
vanity
there
jules
saw
at
his
feet
in
the
long
valley
of
the
seine
between
the
slopes
of
vaugirard
and
meudon
and
those
of
belleville
and
montmartre
the
real
paris
wrapped
in
a
misty
blue
veil
produced
by
smoke
which
the
sunlight
tendered
at
that
moment
diaphanous
he
glanced
with
a
constrained
eye
at
those
forty
thousand
houses
and
said
pointing
to
the
space
comprised
between
the
column
of
the
place
vendome
and
the
gilded
cupola
of
the
invalides
she
was
wrenched
from
me
there
by
the
fatal
curiosity
of
that
world
which
excites
itself
and
meddles
solely
for
excitement
and
twelve
miles
from
where
they
were
on
the
banks
of
the
seine
in
a
modest
village
lying
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
of
that
long
hilly
basin
the
middle
of
which
great
paris
stirs
like
a
child
in
its
cradle
a
death
scene
was
taking
place
far
indeed
removed
from
parisian
pomps
with
no
accompaniment
of
torches
or
tapers
or
without
prayers
of
the
church
in
short
a
death
in
all
simplicity
here
are
the
facts
the
body
of
a
young
girl
was
found
early
in
the
morning
stranded
on
the
in
the
slime
and
reeds
of
the
seine
men
employed
in
dredging
sand
saw
it
as
they
were
getting
into
their
frail
boat
on
their
way
to
their
work
fifty
francs
earned
said
one
of
them
true
said
the
other
they
approached
the
body
a
handsome
girl
we
had
better
go
and
make
our
and
the
two
dredgers
after
covering
the
body
with
their
jackets
went
to
the
house
of
the
village
mayor
who
was
much
embarrassed
at
having
to
make
out
the
legal
papers
necessitated
by
this
discovery
the
news
of
this
event
spread
with
the
telegraphic
rapidity
peculiar
to
regions
where
social
communications
have
no
distractions
where
gossip
scandal
calumny
in
short
the
social
tale
which
feasts
the
world
has
no
break
of
continuity
from
one
boundary
to
another
before
long
persons
arriving
at
the
mayor
s
office
released
him
from
all
embarrassment
they
were
able
to
convert
the
into
a
mere
certificate
of
death
by
recognizing
the
body
as
that
of
the
demoiselle
ida
gruget
living
rue
de
la
number
the
judiciary
police
of
paris
arrived
and
the
mother
bearing
her
daughter
s
last
letter
amid
the
mother
s
moans
a
doctor
certified
to
death
by
asphyxia
through
the
injection
of
black
blood
into
the
pulmonary
system
which
settled
the
matter
the
inquest
over
and
the
certificates
signed
by
six
o
clock
the
same
evening
authority
was
given
to
bury
the
grisette
the
rector
of
the
parish
however
refused
to
receive
her
into
the
church
or
to
pray
for
her
ida
gruget
was
therefore
wrapped
in
a
shroud
by
an
old
put
into
a
common
and
carried
to
the
village
cemetery
by
four
men
followed
by
a
few
inquisitive
who
talked
about
the
death
with
wonder
mingled
with
some
pity
the
widow
gruget
was
charitably
taken
in
by
an
old
lady
who
prevented
her
from
following
the
sad
procession
of
her
daughter
s
funeral
a
man
of
triple
functions
the
beadle
and
of
the
parish
had
dug
a
grave
in
the
cemetery
behind
the
church
a
church
well
known
a
classic
church
with
a
square
tower
and
pointed
roof
covered
with
slate
supported
on
the
outside
by
strong
corner
buttresses
behind
the
apse
of
the
chancel
lay
the
cemetery
enclosed
with
a
dilapidated
wall
a
little
field
full
of
hillocks
no
marble
monuments
no
visitors
but
surely
in
every
furrow
tears
and
true
regrets
which
were
lacking
to
ida
gruget
she
was
cast
into
a
corner
full
of
tall
grass
and
brambles
after
the
coffin
had
been
laid
in
this
field
so
poetic
in
its
simplicity
the
found
himself
alone
for
night
was
coming
on
while
filling
the
grave
he
stopped
now
and
then
to
gaze
over
the
wall
along
the
road
he
was
standing
thus
resting
on
his
spade
and
looking
at
the
seine
which
had
brought
him
the
body
poor
girl
cried
the
voice
of
a
man
who
suddenly
appeared
how
you
made
me
jump
monsieur
said
the
was
any
service
held
over
the
body
you
are
burying
no
monsieur
monsieur
le
cure
wasn
t
willing
this
is
the
first
person
buried
here
who
didn
t
belong
to
the
parish
everybody
knows
everybody
else
in
this
place
does
monsieur
why
he
s
gone
some
days
had
elapsed
when
a
man
dressed
in
black
called
at
the
house
of
monsieur
jules
desmarets
and
without
asking
to
see
him
carried
up
to
the
chamber
of
his
wife
a
large
porphyry
vase
on
which
were
inscribed
the
words
invita
lege
conjugi
moerenti
filiolae
cineres
restituit
amicis
xii
juvantibus
moribundus
pater
what
a
man
cried
jules
bursting
into
tears
eight
days
sufficed
the
husband
to
obey
all
the
wishes
of
his
wife
and
to
arrange
his
own
affairs
he
sold
his
practice
to
a
brother
of
martin
falleix
and
left
paris
while
the
authorities
were
still
discussing
whether
it
was
lawful
for
a
citizen
to
dispose
of
the
body
of
his
wife
who
has
not
encountered
on
the
boulevards
of
paris
at
the
turn
of
a
street
or
beneath
the
arcades
of
the
or
in
any
part
of
the
world
where
chance
may
offer
him
the
sight
a
being
man
or
woman
at
whose
aspect
a
thousand
confused
thoughts
spring
into
his
mind
at
that
sight
we
are
suddenly
interested
either
by
features
of
some
fantastic
conformation
which
reveal
an
agitated
life
or
by
a
singular
effect
of
the
whole
person
produced
by
gestures
air
gait
clothes
or
by
some
deep
intense
look
or
by
other
inexpressible
signs
which
seize
our
minds
suddenly
and
forcibly
without
our
being
able
to
explain
even
to
ourselves
the
cause
of
our
emotion
the
next
day
other
thoughts
and
other
images
have
carried
out
of
sight
that
passing
dream
but
if
we
meet
the
same
personage
again
either
passing
at
some
fixed
hour
like
the
clerk
of
a
mayor
s
office
or
wandering
about
the
public
promenades
like
those
individuals
who
seem
to
be
a
sort
of
furniture
of
the
streets
of
paris
and
who
are
always
to
be
found
in
public
places
at
first
representations
or
noted
restaurants
then
this
being
fastens
himself
or
herself
on
our
memory
and
remains
there
like
the
first
volume
of
a
novel
the
end
of
which
is
lost
we
are
tempted
to
question
this
unknown
person
and
say
who
are
you
why
are
you
lounging
here
by
what
right
do
you
wear
that
pleated
ruffle
that
faded
waistcoat
and
carry
that
cane
with
an
ivory
top
why
those
blue
spectacles
for
what
reason
do
you
cling
to
that
cravat
of
a
dead
and
gone
fashion
among
these
wandering
creations
some
belong
to
the
species
of
the
greek
hermae
they
say
nothing
to
the
soul
are
and
that
is
all
why
is
known
to
none
such
figure
are
a
type
of
those
used
by
sculptors
for
the
four
seasons
for
commerce
for
plenty
etc
some
others
former
lawyers
old
merchants
elderly
generals
move
and
walk
and
yet
seem
stationary
like
old
trees
that
are
half
uprooted
by
the
current
of
a
river
they
seem
never
to
take
part
in
the
torrent
of
paris
with
its
youthful
active
crowd
it
is
impossible
to
know
if
their
friends
have
forgotten
to
bury
them
or
whether
they
have
escaped
out
of
their
coffins
at
any
rate
they
have
reached
the
condition
of
one
of
these
parisian
melmoths
had
come
within
a
few
days
into
a
neighborhood
of
sober
quiet
people
who
when
the
weather
is
fine
are
invariably
to
be
found
in
the
space
which
lies
between
the
south
entrance
of
the
luxembourg
and
the
north
entrance
of
the
observatoire
a
space
without
a
name
the
neutral
space
of
paris
there
paris
is
no
longer
and
there
paris
still
lingers
the
spot
is
a
mingling
of
street
square
boulevard
fortification
garden
avenue
province
and
metropolis
certainly
all
of
that
is
to
be
found
there
and
yet
the
place
is
nothing
of
all
that
it
is
a
desert
around
this
spot
without
a
name
stand
the
foundling
hospital
the
bourbe
the
cochin
hospital
the
capucines
the
hospital
la
rochefoucauld
the
deaf
and
dumb
asylum
the
hospital
of
the
in
short
all
the
vices
and
all
the
misfortunes
of
paris
find
their
asylum
there
and
that
nothing
may
lack
in
this
philanthropic
centre
science
there
studies
the
tides
and
longitudes
monsieur
de
chateaubriand
has
erected
the
infirmary
and
the
carmelites
have
founded
a
convent
the
great
events
of
life
are
represented
by
bells
which
ring
incessantly
through
this
desert
for
the
mother
giving
birth
for
the
babe
that
is
born
for
the
vice
that
succumbs
for
the
toiler
who
dies
for
the
virgin
who
prays
for
the
old
man
shaking
with
cold
for
genius
and
a
few
steps
off
is
the
cemetery
of
where
hour
after
hour
the
sorry
funerals
of
the
faubourg
wend
their
way
this
esplanade
which
commands
a
view
of
paris
has
been
taken
possession
of
by
it
is
in
fact
a
sort
of
bowling
green
frequented
by
old
gray
faces
belonging
to
kindly
worthy
men
who
seem
to
continue
the
race
of
our
ancestors
whose
countenances
must
only
be
compared
with
those
of
their
surroundings
the
man
who
had
become
during
the
last
few
days
an
inhabitant
of
this
desert
region
proved
an
assiduous
attendant
at
these
games
of
bowls
and
must
undoubtedly
be
considered
the
most
striking
creature
of
these
various
groups
who
if
it
is
permissible
to
liken
parisians
to
the
different
orders
of
zoology
belonged
to
the
genus
mollusk
the
kept
sympathetic
step
with
the
the
little
bowl
which
serves
as
a
goal
and
on
which
the
interest
of
the
game
must
centre
he
leaned
against
a
tree
when
the
stopped
then
with
the
same
attention
that
a
dog
gives
to
his
master
s
gestures
he
looked
at
the
other
bowls
flying
through
the
air
or
rolling
along
the
ground
you
might
have
taken
him
for
the
weird
and
watchful
genii
of
the
he
said
nothing
and
the
the
most
fanatic
men
that
can
be
encountered
among
the
sectarians
of
any
faith
had
never
asked
the
reason
of
his
dogged
silence
in
fact
the
most
observing
of
them
thought
him
deaf
and
dumb
when
it
happened
that
the
distances
between
the
bowls
and
the
had
to
be
measured
the
cane
of
this
silent
being
was
used
as
a
measure
the
players
coming
up
and
taking
it
from
the
icy
hands
of
the
old
man
and
returning
it
without
a
word
or
even
a
sign
of
friendliness
the
loan
of
his
cane
seemed
a
servitude
to
which
he
had
negatively
consented
when
a
shower
fell
he
stayed
near
the
the
slave
of
the
bowls
and
the
guardian
of
the
unfinished
game
rain
affected
him
no
more
than
the
fine
weather
did
he
was
like
the
players
themselves
an
intermediary
species
between
a
parisian
who
has
the
lowest
intellect
of
his
kind
and
an
animal
which
has
the
highest
in
other
respects
pallid
and
shrunken
indifferent
to
his
own
person
vacant
in
mind
he
often
came
bareheaded
showing
his
sparse
white
hair
and
his
square
yellow
bald
skull
like
the
knee
of
a
beggar
seen
through
his
tattered
trousers
his
mouth
was
no
ideas
were
in
his
glance
no
precise
object
appeared
in
his
movements
he
never
smiled
he
never
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
but
kept
them
habitually
on
the
ground
where
he
seemed
to
be
looking
for
something
at
four
o
clock
an
old
woman
arrived
to
take
him
heaven
knows
where
which
she
did
by
towing
him
along
by
the
arm
as
a
young
girl
drags
a
wilful
goat
which
still
wants
to
browse
by
the
wayside
this
old
man
was
a
horrible
thing
to
see
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
when
jules
desmarets
left
paris
his
in
which
he
was
alone
passed
rapidly
through
the
rue
de
l
est
and
came
out
upon
the
esplanade
of
the
observatoire
at
the
moment
when
the
old
man
leaning
against
a
tree
had
allowed
his
cane
to
be
taken
from
his
hand
amid
the
noisy
vociferations
of
the
players
pacifically
irritated
jules
thinking
that
he
recognized
that
face
felt
an
impulse
to
stop
and
at
the
same
instant
the
carriage
came
to
a
standstill
for
the
postilion
hemmed
in
by
some
handcarts
had
too
much
respect
for
the
game
to
call
upon
the
players
to
make
way
for
him
it
is
he
said
jules
beholding
in
that
human
wreck

after

in
a
spanish
city
on
an
island
in
the
mediterranean
there
stands
a
convent
of
the
order
of
barefoot
carmelites
where
the
rule
instituted
by
theresa
is
still
preserved
with
all
the
first
rigor
of
the
reformation
brought
about
by
that
illustrious
woman
extraordinary
as
this
may
seem
it
is
none
the
less
true
almost
every
religious
house
in
the
peninsula
or
in
europe
for
that
matter
was
either
destroyed
or
disorganized
by
the
outbreak
of
the
french
revolution
and
the
napoleonic
wars
but
as
this
island
was
protected
through
those
times
by
the
english
fleet
its
wealthy
convent
and
peaceable
inhabitants
were
secure
from
the
general
trouble
and
spoliation
the
storms
of
many
kinds
which
shook
the
first
fifteen
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
spent
their
force
before
they
reached
those
cliffs
at
so
short
a
distance
from
the
coast
of
andalusia
if
the
rumour
of
the
emperor
s
name
so
much
as
reached
the
shore
of
the
island
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
holy
women
kneeling
in
the
cloisters
grasped
the
reality
of
his
progress
of
glory
or
the
majesty
that
blazed
in
flame
across
kingdom
after
kingdom
during
his
meteor
life
in
the
minds
of
the
roman
catholic
world
the
convent
stood
out
for
a
stern
discipline
which
nothing
had
changed
the
purity
of
its
rule
had
attracted
unhappy
women
from
the
furthest
parts
of
europe
women
deprived
of
all
human
ties
sighing
after
the
long
suicide
accomplished
in
the
breast
of
god
no
convent
indeed
was
so
well
fitted
for
that
complete
detachment
of
the
soul
from
all
earthly
things
which
is
demanded
by
the
religious
life
albeit
on
the
continent
of
europe
there
are
many
convents
magnificently
adapted
to
the
purpose
of
their
existence
buried
away
in
the
loneliest
valleys
hanging
in
on
the
steepest
mountainsides
set
down
on
the
brink
of
precipices
in
every
place
man
has
sought
for
the
poetry
of
the
infinite
the
solemn
awe
of
silence
in
every
place
man
has
striven
to
draw
closer
to
god
seeking
him
on
mountain
peaks
in
the
depths
below
the
crags
at
the
cliff
s
edge
and
everywhere
man
has
found
god
but
nowhere
save
on
this
ledge
of
rock
could
you
find
so
many
different
harmonies
combining
so
to
raise
the
soul
that
the
sharpest
pain
comes
to
be
like
other
memories
the
strongest
impressions
are
dulled
till
the
sorrows
of
life
are
laid
to
rest
in
the
depths
the
convent
stands
on
the
highest
point
of
the
crags
at
the
uttermost
end
of
the
island
on
the
side
towards
the
sea
the
rock
was
once
rent
sheer
away
in
some
it
rises
up
a
straight
wall
from
the
base
where
the
waves
gnaw
at
the
stone
below
mark
any
assault
is
made
impossible
by
the
dangerous
reefs
that
stretch
far
out
to
sea
with
the
sparkling
waves
of
the
mediterranean
playing
over
them
so
only
from
the
sea
can
you
discern
the
square
mass
of
the
convent
built
conformably
to
the
minute
rules
laid
down
as
to
the
shape
height
doors
and
windows
of
monastic
buildings
from
the
side
of
the
town
the
church
completely
hides
the
solid
structure
of
the
cloisters
and
their
roofs
covered
with
broad
slabs
of
stone
impervious
to
sun
or
storm
or
gales
of
wind
the
church
itself
built
by
the
munificence
of
a
spanish
family
is
the
crowning
edifice
of
the
town
its
fine
bold
front
gives
an
imposing
and
picturesque
look
to
the
little
city
in
the
sea
the
sight
of
such
a
city
with
its
roofs
arranged
for
the
most
part
above
a
picturesque
harbour
and
crowned
by
a
glorious
cathedral
front
with
gothic
doorways
belfry
towers
and
filigree
spires
is
a
spectacle
surely
in
every
way
the
sublimest
on
earth
religion
towering
above
daily
life
to
put
men
continually
in
mind
of
the
end
and
the
way
is
in
truth
a
thoroughly
spanish
conception
but
now
surround
this
picture
by
the
mediterranean
and
a
burning
sky
imagine
a
few
palms
here
and
there
a
few
stunted
evergreen
trees
mingling
their
waving
leaves
with
the
motionless
flowers
and
foliage
of
carved
stone
look
out
over
the
reef
with
its
white
fringes
of
foam
in
contrast
to
the
sapphire
sea
and
then
turn
to
the
city
with
its
galleries
and
terraces
whither
the
townsfolk
come
to
take
the
air
among
their
flowers
of
an
evening
above
the
houses
and
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
their
little
gardens
add
a
few
sails
down
in
the
harbour
and
lastly
in
the
stillness
of
falling
night
listen
to
the
organ
music
the
chanting
of
the
services
the
wonderful
sound
of
bells
pealing
out
over
the
open
sea
there
is
sound
and
silence
everywhere
oftener
still
there
is
silence
over
all
the
church
is
divided
within
into
a
sombre
mysterious
nave
and
narrow
aisles
for
some
reason
probably
because
the
winds
are
so
high
the
architect
was
unable
to
build
the
flying
buttresses
and
intervening
chapels
which
adorn
almost
all
cathedrals
nor
are
there
openings
of
any
kind
in
the
walls
which
support
the
weight
of
the
roof
outside
there
is
simply
the
heavy
wall
structure
a
solid
mass
of
grey
stone
further
strengthened
by
huge
piers
placed
at
intervals
inside
the
nave
and
its
little
side
galleries
are
lighted
entirely
by
the
great
suspended
by
a
miracle
of
art
above
the
centre
doorway
for
upon
that
side
the
exposure
permits
of
the
display
of
lacework
in
stone
and
of
other
beauties
peculiar
to
the
style
improperly
called
gothic
the
larger
part
of
the
nave
and
aisles
was
left
for
the
townsfolk
who
came
and
went
and
heard
mass
there
the
choir
was
shut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
church
by
a
grating
and
thick
folds
of
brown
curtain
left
slightly
apart
in
the
middle
in
such
a
way
that
nothing
of
the
choir
could
be
seen
from
the
church
except
the
high
altar
and
the
officiating
priest
the
grating
itself
was
divided
up
by
the
pillars
which
supported
the
organ
loft
and
this
part
of
the
structure
with
its
carved
wooden
columns
completed
the
line
of
the
arcading
in
the
gallery
carried
by
the
shafts
in
the
nave
if
any
inquisitive
person
therefore
had
been
bold
enough
to
climb
upon
the
narrow
balustrade
in
the
gallery
to
look
down
into
the
choir
he
could
have
seen
nothing
but
the
tall
windows
of
stained
glass
beyond
the
high
altar
at
the
time
of
the
french
expedition
into
spain
to
establish
ferdinand
vii
once
more
on
the
throne
a
french
general
came
to
the
island
after
the
taking
of
cadiz
ostensibly
to
require
the
recognition
of
the
king
s
government
really
to
see
the
convent
and
to
find
some
means
of
entering
it
the
undertaking
was
certainly
a
delicate
one
but
a
man
of
passionate
temper
whose
life
had
been
as
it
were
but
one
series
of
poems
in
action
a
man
who
all
his
life
long
had
lived
romances
instead
of
writing
them
a
man
a
doer
was
sure
to
be
tempted
by
a
deed
which
seemed
to
be
impossible
to
open
the
doors
of
a
convent
of
nuns
by
lawful
means
the
metropolitan
or
the
pope
would
scarcely
have
permitted
it
and
as
for
force
or
stratagem
might
not
any
indiscretion
cost
him
his
position
his
whole
career
as
a
soldier
and
the
end
in
view
to
boot
the
duc
d
angouleme
was
still
in
spain
and
of
all
the
crimes
which
a
man
in
favour
with
the
might
commit
this
one
alone
was
certain
to
find
him
inexorable
the
general
had
asked
for
the
mission
to
gratify
private
motives
of
curiosity
though
never
was
curiosity
more
hopeless
this
final
attempt
was
a
matter
of
conscience
the
carmelite
convent
on
the
island
was
the
only
nunnery
in
spain
which
had
baffled
his
search
as
he
crossed
from
the
mainland
scarcely
an
hour
s
distance
he
felt
a
presentiment
that
his
hopes
were
to
be
fulfilled
and
afterwards
when
as
yet
he
had
seen
nothing
of
the
convent
but
its
walls
and
of
the
nuns
not
so
much
as
their
robes
while
he
had
merely
heard
the
chanting
of
the
service
there
were
dim
auguries
under
the
walls
and
in
the
sound
of
the
voices
to
justify
his
frail
hope
and
indeed
however
faint
those
so
unaccountable
presentiments
might
be
never
was
human
passion
more
vehemently
excited
than
the
general
s
curiosity
at
that
moment
there
are
no
small
events
for
the
heart
the
heart
exaggerates
everything
the
heart
weighs
the
fall
of
a
empire
and
the
dropping
of
a
woman
s
glove
in
the
same
scales
and
the
glove
is
nearly
always
the
heavier
of
the
two
so
here
are
the
facts
in
all
their
prosaic
simplicity
the
facts
first
the
emotions
will
follow
an
hour
after
the
general
landed
on
the
island
the
royal
authority
was
there
some
few
constitutional
spaniards
who
had
found
their
way
thither
after
the
fall
of
cadiz
were
allowed
to
charter
a
vessel
and
sail
for
london
so
there
was
neither
resistance
nor
reaction
but
the
change
of
government
could
not
be
effected
in
the
little
town
without
a
mass
at
which
the
two
divisions
under
the
general
s
command
were
obliged
to
be
present
now
it
was
upon
this
mass
that
the
general
had
built
his
hopes
of
gaining
some
information
as
to
the
sisters
in
the
convent
he
was
quite
unaware
how
absolutely
the
carmelites
were
cut
off
from
the
world
but
he
knew
that
there
might
be
among
them
one
whom
he
held
dearer
than
life
dearer
than
honour
his
hopes
were
cruelly
dashed
at
once
mass
it
is
true
was
celebrated
in
state
in
honour
of
such
a
solemnity
the
curtains
which
always
hid
the
choir
were
drawn
back
to
display
its
riches
its
valuable
paintings
and
shrines
so
bright
with
gems
that
they
eclipsed
the
glories
of
the
of
gold
and
silver
hung
up
by
sailors
of
the
port
on
the
columns
in
the
nave
but
all
the
nuns
had
taken
refuge
in
the
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
first
check
during
this
very
mass
of
thanksgiving
the
most
intimately
thrilling
drama
that
ever
set
a
man
s
heart
beating
opened
out
widely
before
him
the
sister
who
played
the
organ
aroused
such
intense
enthusiasm
that
not
a
single
man
regretted
that
he
had
come
to
the
service
even
the
men
in
the
ranks
were
delighted
and
the
officers
were
in
ecstasy
as
for
the
general
he
was
seemingly
calm
and
indifferent
the
sensations
stirred
in
him
as
the
sister
played
one
piece
after
another
belong
to
the
small
number
of
things
which
it
is
not
lawful
to
utter
words
are
powerless
to
express
them
like
death
god
eternity
they
can
only
be
realised
through
their
one
point
of
contact
with
humanity
strangely
enough
the
organ
music
seemed
to
belong
to
the
school
of
rossini
the
musician
who
brings
most
human
passion
into
his
art
some
day
his
works
by
their
number
and
extent
will
receive
the
reverence
due
to
the
homer
of
music
from
among
all
the
scores
that
we
owe
to
his
great
genius
the
nun
seemed
to
have
chosen
in
for
special
study
doubtless
because
the
spirit
of
sacred
music
finds
therein
its
supreme
expression
perhaps
the
soul
of
the
great
musician
so
gloriously
known
to
europe
and
the
soul
of
this
unknown
executant
had
met
in
the
intuitive
apprehension
of
the
same
poetry
so
at
least
thought
two
dilettanti
officers
who
must
have
missed
the
theatre
favart
in
spain
at
last
in
the
no
one
could
fail
to
discern
a
french
soul
in
the
sudden
change
that
came
over
the
music
joy
for
the
victory
of
the
most
christian
king
evidently
stirred
this
nun
s
heart
to
the
depths
she
was
a
frenchwoman
beyond
mistake
soon
the
love
of
country
shone
out
breaking
forth
like
shafts
of
light
from
the
fugue
as
the
sister
introduced
variations
with
all
a
parisienne
s
fastidious
taste
and
blended
vague
suggestions
of
our
grandest
national
airs
with
her
music
a
spaniard
s
fingers
would
not
have
brought
this
warmth
into
a
graceful
tribute
paid
to
the
victorious
arms
of
france
the
musician
s
nationality
was
revealed
we
find
france
everywhere
it
seems
said
one
of
the
men
the
general
had
left
the
church
during
the
he
could
not
listen
any
longer
the
nun
s
music
had
been
a
revelation
of
a
woman
loved
to
frenzy
a
woman
so
carefully
hidden
from
the
world
s
eyes
so
deeply
buried
in
the
bosom
of
the
church
that
hitherto
the
most
ingenious
and
persistent
efforts
made
by
men
who
brought
great
influence
and
unusual
powers
to
bear
upon
the
search
had
failed
to
find
her
the
suspicion
aroused
in
the
general
s
heart
became
all
but
a
certainty
with
the
vague
reminiscence
of
a
sad
delicious
melody
the
air
of
du
the
woman
he
loved
had
played
the
prelude
to
the
ballad
in
a
boudoir
in
paris
how
often
and
now
this
nun
had
chosen
the
song
to
express
an
exile
s
longing
amid
the
joy
of
those
that
triumphed
terrible
sensation
to
hope
for
the
resurrection
of
a
lost
love
to
find
her
only
to
know
that
she
was
lost
to
catch
a
mysterious
glimpse
of
her
after
five
years
five
years
in
which
the
passion
chafing
in
an
empty
life
had
grown
the
mightier
for
every
fruitless
effort
to
satisfy
it
who
has
not
known
at
least
once
in
his
life
what
it
is
to
lose
some
precious
thing
and
after
hunting
through
his
papers
ransacking
his
memory
and
turning
his
house
upside
down
after
one
or
two
days
spent
in
vain
search
and
hope
and
despair
after
a
prodigious
expenditure
of
the
liveliest
irritation
of
soul
who
has
not
known
the
ineffable
pleasure
of
finding
that
nothing
which
had
come
to
be
a
king
of
monomania
very
good
now
spread
that
fury
of
search
over
five
years
put
a
woman
put
a
heart
put
love
in
the
place
of
the
trifle
transpose
the
monomania
into
the
key
of
high
passion
and
furthermore
let
the
seeker
be
a
man
of
ardent
temper
with
a
lion
s
heart
and
a
leonine
head
and
mane
a
man
to
inspire
awe
and
fear
in
those
who
come
in
contact
with
him
realise
this
and
you
may
perhaps
understand
why
the
general
walked
abruptly
out
of
the
church
when
the
first
notes
of
a
ballad
which
he
used
to
hear
with
a
rapture
of
delight
in
a
boudoir
began
to
vibrate
along
the
aisles
of
the
church
in
the
sea
the
general
walked
away
down
the
steep
street
which
led
to
the
port
and
only
stopped
when
he
could
not
hear
the
deep
notes
of
the
organ
unable
to
think
of
anything
but
the
love
which
broke
out
in
volcanic
eruption
filling
his
heart
with
fire
he
only
knew
that
the
was
over
when
the
spanish
congregation
came
pouring
out
of
the
church
feeling
that
his
behaviour
and
attitude
might
seem
ridiculous
he
went
back
to
head
the
procession
telling
the
alcalde
and
the
governor
that
feeling
suddenly
faint
he
had
gone
out
into
the
air
casting
about
for
a
plea
for
prolonging
his
stay
it
at
once
occurred
to
him
to
make
the
most
of
this
excuse
framed
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
declined
on
a
plea
of
increasing
indisposition
to
preside
at
the
banquet
given
by
the
town
to
the
french
officers
betook
himself
to
his
bed
and
sent
a
message
to
the
to
the
effect
that
temporary
illness
obliged
him
to
leave
the
colonel
in
command
of
the
troops
for
the
time
being
this
commonplace
but
very
plausible
stratagem
relieved
him
of
all
responsibility
for
the
time
necessary
to
carry
out
his
plans
the
general
nothing
if
not
catholic
and
monarchical
took
occasion
to
inform
himself
of
the
hours
of
the
services
and
manifested
the
greatest
zeal
for
the
performance
of
his
religious
duties
piety
which
caused
no
remark
in
spain
the
very
next
day
while
the
division
was
marching
out
of
the
town
the
general
went
to
the
convent
to
be
present
at
vespers
he
found
an
empty
church
the
townsfolk
devout
though
they
were
had
all
gone
down
to
the
quay
to
watch
the
embarkation
of
the
troops
he
felt
glad
to
be
the
only
man
there
he
tramped
noisily
up
the
nave
clanking
his
spurs
till
the
vaulted
roof
rang
with
the
sound
he
coughed
he
talked
aloud
to
himself
to
let
the
nuns
know
and
more
particularly
to
let
the
organist
know
that
if
the
troops
were
gone
one
frenchman
was
left
behind
was
this
singular
warning
heard
and
understood
he
thought
so
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
the
organ
made
response
which
was
borne
to
him
on
the
vibrating
air
the
nun
s
spirit
found
wings
in
music
and
fled
towards
him
throbbing
with
the
rhythmical
pulse
of
the
sounds
then
in
all
its
might
the
music
burst
forth
and
filled
the
church
with
warmth
the
song
of
joy
set
apart
in
the
sublime
liturgy
of
latin
christianity
to
express
the
exaltation
of
the
soul
in
the
presence
of
the
glory
of
the
god
became
the
utterance
of
a
heart
almost
terrified
by
its
gladness
in
the
presence
of
the
glory
of
a
mortal
love
a
love
that
yet
lived
a
love
that
had
risen
to
trouble
her
even
beyond
the
grave
in
which
the
nun
is
laid
that
she
may
rise
again
as
the
bride
of
christ
the
organ
is
in
truth
the
grandest
the
most
daring
the
most
magnificent
of
all
instruments
invented
by
human
genius
it
is
a
whole
orchestra
in
itself
it
can
express
anything
in
response
to
a
skilled
touch
surely
it
is
in
some
sort
a
pedestal
on
which
the
soul
poises
for
a
flight
forth
into
space
essaying
on
her
course
to
draw
picture
after
picture
in
an
endless
series
to
paint
human
life
to
cross
the
infinite
that
separates
heaven
from
earth
and
the
longer
a
dreamer
listens
to
those
giant
harmonies
the
better
he
realizes
that
nothing
save
this
choir
on
earth
can
fill
all
the
space
between
kneeling
men
and
a
god
hidden
by
the
blinding
light
of
the
sanctuary
the
music
is
the
one
interpreter
strong
enough
to
bear
up
the
prayers
of
humanity
to
heaven
prayer
in
its
omnipotent
moods
prayer
tinged
by
the
melancholy
of
many
different
natures
coloured
by
meditative
ecstasy
upspringing
with
the
impulse
of
repentance
blended
with
the
myriad
fancies
of
every
creed
yes
in
those
long
vaulted
aisles
the
melodies
inspired
by
the
sense
of
things
divine
are
blended
with
a
grandeur
unknown
before
are
decked
with
new
glory
and
might
out
of
the
dim
daylight
and
the
deep
silence
broken
by
the
chanting
of
the
choir
in
response
to
the
thunder
of
the
organ
a
veil
is
woven
for
god
and
the
brightness
of
his
attributes
shines
through
it
and
this
wealth
of
holy
things
seemed
to
be
flung
down
like
a
grain
of
incense
upon
the
fragile
altar
raised
to
love
beneath
the
eternal
throne
of
a
jealous
and
avenging
god
indeed
in
the
joy
of
the
nun
there
was
little
of
that
awe
and
gravity
which
should
harmonize
with
the
solemnities
of
the
she
had
enriched
the
music
with
graceful
variations
earthly
gladness
throbbing
through
the
rhythm
of
each
in
such
brilliant
quivering
notes
some
great
singer
might
strive
to
find
a
voice
for
her
love
her
melodies
fluttered
as
a
bird
flutters
about
her
mate
there
were
moments
when
she
seemed
to
leap
back
into
the
past
to
dally
there
now
with
laughter
now
with
tears
her
changing
moods
as
it
were
ran
riot
she
was
like
a
woman
excited
and
happy
over
her
lover
s
return
but
at
length
after
the
swaying
fugues
of
delirium
after
the
marvellous
rendering
of
a
vision
of
the
past
a
revulsion
swept
over
the
soul
that
thus
found
utterance
for
itself
with
a
swift
transition
from
the
major
to
the
minor
the
organist
told
her
hearer
of
her
present
lot
she
gave
the
story
of
long
melancholy
broodings
of
the
slow
course
of
her
moral
malady
how
day
by
day
she
deadened
the
senses
how
every
night
cut
off
one
more
thought
how
her
heart
was
slowly
reduced
to
ashes
the
sadness
deepened
shade
after
shade
through
languid
modulations
and
in
a
little
while
the
echoes
were
pouring
out
a
torrent
of
grief
then
on
a
sudden
high
notes
rang
out
like
the
voices
of
angels
singing
together
as
if
to
tell
the
lost
but
not
forgotten
lover
that
their
spirits
now
could
only
meet
in
heaven
pathetic
hope
then
followed
the
no
more
joy
no
more
tears
in
the
air
no
sadness
no
regrets
the
was
the
return
to
god
the
final
chord
was
deep
solemn
even
terrible
for
the
last
rumblings
of
the
bass
sent
a
shiver
through
the
audience
that
raised
the
hair
on
their
heads
the
nun
shook
out
her
veiling
of
crepe
and
seemed
to
sink
again
into
the
grave
from
which
she
had
risen
for
a
moment
slowly
the
reverberations
died
away
it
seemed
as
if
the
church
but
now
so
full
of
light
had
returned
to
thick
darkness
the
general
had
been
caught
up
and
borne
swiftly
away
by
this
spirit
he
had
followed
the
course
of
its
flight
from
beginning
to
end
he
understood
to
the
fullest
extent
the
imagery
of
that
burning
symphony
for
him
the
chords
reached
deep
and
far
for
him
as
for
the
sister
the
poem
meant
future
present
and
past
is
not
music
and
even
opera
music
a
sort
of
text
which
a
susceptible
or
poetic
temper
or
a
sore
and
stricken
heart
may
expand
as
memories
shall
determine
if
a
musician
must
needs
have
the
heart
of
a
poet
must
not
the
listener
too
be
in
a
manner
a
poet
and
a
lover
to
hear
all
that
lies
in
great
music
religion
love
and
music
what
are
they
but
a
threefold
expression
of
the
same
fact
of
that
craving
for
expansion
which
stirs
in
every
noble
soul
and
these
three
forms
of
poetry
ascend
to
god
in
whom
all
passion
on
earth
finds
its
end
wherefore
the
holy
human
trinity
finds
a
place
amid
the
infinite
glories
of
god
of
god
whom
we
always
represent
surrounded
with
the
fires
of
love
and
seistrons
of
gold
music
and
light
and
harmony
is
not
he
the
cause
and
the
end
of
all
our
strivings
the
french
general
guessed
rightly
that
here
in
the
desert
on
this
bare
rock
in
the
sea
the
nun
had
seized
upon
music
as
an
outpouring
of
the
passion
that
still
consumed
her
was
this
her
manner
of
offering
up
her
love
as
a
sacrifice
to
god
or
was
it
love
exultant
in
triumph
over
god
the
questions
were
hard
to
answer
but
one
thing
at
least
the
general
could
not
mistake
in
this
heart
dead
to
the
world
the
fire
of
passion
burned
as
fiercely
as
in
his
own
vespers
over
he
went
back
to
the
alcalde
with
whom
he
was
staying
in
the
joy
which
comes
in
such
full
measure
when
a
satisfaction
sought
long
and
painfully
is
attained
at
last
he
could
see
nothing
beyond
this
he
was
still
loved
in
her
heart
love
had
grown
in
loneliness
even
as
his
love
had
grown
stronger
as
he
surmounted
one
barrier
after
another
which
this
woman
had
set
between
them
the
glow
of
soul
came
to
its
natural
end
there
followed
a
longing
to
see
her
again
to
contend
with
god
for
her
to
snatch
her
away
a
rash
scheme
which
appealed
to
a
daring
nature
he
went
to
bed
when
the
meal
was
over
to
avoid
questions
to
be
alone
and
think
at
his
ease
and
he
lay
absorbed
by
deep
thought
till
day
broke
he
rose
only
to
go
to
mass
he
went
to
the
church
and
knelt
close
to
the
screen
with
his
forehead
touching
the
curtain
he
would
have
torn
a
hole
in
it
if
he
had
been
alone
but
his
host
had
come
with
him
out
of
politeness
and
the
least
imprudence
might
compromise
the
whole
future
of
his
love
and
ruin
the
new
hopes
the
organ
sounded
but
it
was
another
player
and
not
the
nun
of
the
last
two
days
whose
hands
touched
the
keys
it
was
all
colorless
and
cold
for
the
general
was
the
woman
he
loved
prostrated
by
emotion
which
overcame
a
strong
man
s
heart
had
she
so
fully
realised
and
shared
an
unchanged
love
that
now
she
lay
dying
on
her
bed
in
her
cell
while
innumerable
thoughts
of
this
kind
perplexed
his
mind
the
voice
of
the
woman
he
worshipped
rang
out
close
beside
him
he
knew
its
clear
resonant
soprano
it
was
her
voice
with
that
faint
tremor
in
it
which
gave
it
all
the
charm
that
shyness
and
diffidence
gives
to
a
young
girl
her
voice
distinct
from
the
mass
of
singing
as
a
donna
in
the
chorus
of
a
finale
it
was
like
a
golden
or
silver
thread
in
dark
frieze
it
was
she
there
could
be
no
mistake
parisienne
now
as
ever
she
had
not
laid
coquetry
aside
when
she
threw
off
worldly
adornments
for
the
veil
and
the
carmelite
s
coarse
serge
she
who
had
affirmed
her
love
last
evening
in
the
praise
sent
up
to
god
seemed
now
to
say
to
her
lover
yes
it
is
i
am
here
my
love
is
unchanged
but
i
am
beyond
the
reach
of
love
you
will
hear
my
voice
my
soul
shall
enfold
you
and
i
shall
abide
here
under
the
brown
shroud
in
the
choir
from
which
no
power
on
earth
can
tear
me
you
shall
never
see
me
more
it
is
she
indeed
the
general
said
to
himself
raising
his
head
he
had
leant
his
face
on
his
hands
unable
at
first
to
bear
the
intolerable
emotion
that
surged
like
a
whirlpool
in
his
heart
when
that
voice
vibrated
under
the
arcading
with
the
sound
of
the
sea
for
accompaniment
storm
was
without
and
calm
within
the
sanctuary
still
that
rich
voice
poured
out
all
its
caressing
notes
it
fell
like
balm
on
the
lover
s
burning
heart
it
blossomed
upon
the
air
the
air
that
a
man
would
fain
breathe
more
deeply
to
receive
the
effluence
of
a
soul
breathed
forth
with
love
in
the
words
of
the
prayer
the
alcalde
coming
to
join
his
guest
found
him
in
tears
during
the
elevation
while
the
nun
was
singing
and
brought
him
back
to
his
house
surprised
to
find
so
much
piety
in
a
french
military
man
the
worthy
magistrate
invited
the
confessor
of
the
convent
to
meet
his
guest
never
had
news
given
the
general
more
pleasure
he
paid
the
ecclesiastic
a
good
deal
of
attention
at
supper
and
confirmed
his
spanish
hosts
in
the
high
opinion
they
had
formed
of
his
piety
by
a
not
wholly
disinterested
respect
he
inquired
with
gravity
how
many
sisters
there
were
in
the
convent
and
asked
for
particulars
of
its
endowment
and
revenues
as
if
from
courtesy
he
wished
to
hear
the
good
priest
discourse
on
the
subject
most
interesting
to
him
he
informed
himself
as
to
the
manner
of
life
led
by
the
holy
women
were
they
allowed
to
go
out
of
the
convent
or
to
see
visitors
senor
replied
the
venerable
churchman
the
rule
is
strict
a
woman
can
not
enter
a
monastery
of
the
order
of
bruno
without
a
special
permission
from
his
holiness
and
the
rule
here
is
equally
stringent
no
man
may
enter
a
convent
of
barefoot
carmelites
unless
he
is
a
priest
specially
attached
to
the
services
of
the
house
by
the
archbishop
none
of
the
nuns
may
leave
the
convent
though
the
great
saint
theresa
often
left
her
cell
the
visitor
or
the
mothers
superior
can
alone
give
permission
subject
to
an
authorization
from
the
archbishop
for
a
nun
to
see
a
visitor
and
then
especially
in
a
case
of
illness
now
we
are
one
of
the
principal
houses
and
consequently
we
have
a
mother
superior
here
among
other
foreign
sisters
there
is
one
frenchwoman
sister
theresa
she
it
is
who
directs
the
music
in
the
oh
said
the
general
with
feigned
surprise
she
must
have
rejoiced
over
the
victory
of
the
house
of
i
told
them
the
reason
of
the
mass
they
are
always
a
little
bit
but
sister
theresa
may
have
interests
in
france
perhaps
she
would
like
to
send
some
message
or
to
hear
i
do
not
think
so
she
would
have
come
to
ask
as
a
i
should
be
quite
curious
to
see
her
said
the
general
if
it
is
possible
if
the
lady
superior
consents
if
even
at
the
grating
and
in
the
reverend
mother
s
presence
an
interview
would
be
quite
impossible
for
anybody
whatsoever
but
strict
as
the
mother
is
for
a
deliverer
of
our
holy
religion
and
the
throne
of
his
catholic
majesty
the
rule
might
be
relaxed
for
a
moment
said
the
confessor
blinking
i
will
speak
about
how
old
is
sister
theresa
inquired
the
lover
he
dared
not
ask
any
questions
of
the
priest
as
to
the
nun
s
beauty
she
does
not
reckon
years
now
the
good
man
answered
with
a
simplicity
that
made
the
general
shudder
next
day
before
siesta
the
confessor
came
to
inform
the
french
general
that
sister
theresa
and
the
mother
consented
to
receive
him
at
the
grating
in
the
parlour
before
vespers
the
general
spent
the
siesta
in
pacing
to
and
fro
along
the
quay
in
the
noonday
heat
thither
the
priest
came
to
find
him
and
brought
him
to
the
convent
by
way
of
the
gallery
round
the
cemetery
fountains
green
trees
and
rows
of
arcading
maintained
a
cool
freshness
in
keeping
with
the
place
at
the
further
end
of
the
long
gallery
the
priest
led
the
way
into
a
large
room
divided
in
two
by
a
grating
covered
with
a
brown
curtain
in
the
first
and
in
some
sort
of
public
half
of
the
apartment
where
the
confessor
left
the
newcomer
a
wooden
bench
ran
round
the
wall
and
two
or
three
chairs
also
of
wood
were
placed
near
the
grating
the
ceiling
consisted
of
bare
unornamented
joists
and
of
ilex
wood
as
the
two
windows
were
both
on
the
inner
side
of
the
grating
and
the
dark
surface
of
the
wood
was
a
bad
reflector
the
light
in
the
place
was
so
dim
that
you
could
scarcely
see
the
great
black
crucifix
the
portrait
of
saint
theresa
and
a
picture
of
the
madonna
which
adorned
the
grey
parlour
walls
tumultuous
as
the
general
s
feelings
were
they
took
something
of
the
melancholy
of
the
place
he
grew
calm
in
that
homely
quiet
a
sense
of
something
vast
as
the
tomb
took
possession
of
him
beneath
the
chill
unceiled
roof
here
as
in
the
grave
was
there
not
eternal
silence
deep
peace
the
sense
of
the
infinite
and
besides
this
there
was
the
quiet
and
the
fixed
thought
of
the
cloister
a
thought
which
you
felt
like
a
subtle
presence
in
the
air
and
in
the
dim
dusk
of
the
room
an
thought
nowhere
definitely
expressed
and
looming
the
larger
in
the
imagination
for
in
the
cloister
the
great
saying
peace
in
the
lord
enters
the
least
religious
soul
as
a
living
force
the
monk
s
life
is
scarcely
comprehensible
a
man
seems
confessed
a
weakling
in
a
monastery
he
was
born
to
act
to
live
out
a
life
of
work
he
is
evading
a
man
s
destiny
in
his
cell
but
what
man
s
strength
blended
with
pathetic
weakness
is
implied
by
a
woman
s
choice
of
the
convent
life
a
man
may
have
any
number
of
motives
for
burying
himself
in
a
monastery
for
him
it
is
the
leap
over
the
precipice
a
woman
has
but
one
motive
she
is
a
woman
still
she
betrothes
herself
to
a
heavenly
bridegroom
of
the
monk
you
may
ask
why
did
you
not
fight
your
battle
but
if
a
woman
immures
herself
in
the
cloister
is
there
not
always
a
sublime
battle
fought
first
at
length
it
seemed
to
the
general
that
that
still
room
and
the
lonely
convent
in
the
sea
were
full
of
thoughts
of
him
love
seldom
attains
to
solemnity
yet
surely
a
love
still
faithful
in
the
breast
of
god
was
something
solemn
something
more
than
a
man
had
a
right
to
look
for
as
things
are
in
this
nineteenth
century
the
infinite
grandeur
of
the
situation
might
well
produce
an
effect
upon
the
general
s
mind
he
had
precisely
enough
elevation
of
soul
to
forget
politics
honours
spain
and
society
in
paris
and
to
rise
to
the
height
of
this
lofty
climax
and
what
in
truth
could
be
more
tragic
how
much
must
pass
in
the
souls
of
these
two
lovers
brought
together
in
a
place
of
strangers
on
a
ledge
of
granite
in
the
sea
yet
held
apart
by
an
intangible
unsurmountable
barrier
try
to
imagine
the
man
saying
within
himself
shall
i
triumph
over
god
in
her
heart
when
a
faint
rustling
sound
made
him
quiver
and
the
curtain
was
drawn
aside
between
him
and
the
light
stood
a
woman
her
face
was
hidden
by
the
veil
that
drooped
from
the
folds
upon
her
head
she
was
dressed
according
to
the
rule
of
the
order
in
a
gown
of
the
colour
become
proverbial
her
bare
feet
were
hidden
if
the
general
could
have
seen
them
he
would
have
known
how
appallingly
thin
she
had
grown
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
thick
folds
of
her
coarse
gown
a
mere
covering
and
no
ornament
he
could
guess
how
tears
and
prayer
and
passion
and
loneliness
had
wasted
the
woman
before
him
an
hand
belonging
no
doubt
to
the
mother
superior
held
back
the
curtain
the
general
gave
the
enforced
witness
of
their
interview
a
searching
glance
and
met
the
dark
inscrutable
gaze
of
an
aged
recluse
the
mother
might
have
been
a
century
old
but
the
bright
youthful
eyes
belied
the
wrinkles
that
furrowed
her
pale
face
mme
la
duchesse
he
began
his
voice
shaken
with
emotion
does
your
companion
understand
french
the
veiled
figure
bowed
her
head
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
there
is
no
duchess
here
she
replied
it
is
sister
theresa
whom
you
see
before
you
she
whom
you
call
my
companion
is
my
mother
in
god
my
superior
here
on
the
words
were
so
meekly
spoken
by
the
voice
that
sounded
in
other
years
amid
harmonious
surroundings
of
refined
luxury
the
voice
of
a
queen
of
fashion
in
paris
such
words
from
the
lips
that
once
spoke
so
lightly
and
flippantly
struck
the
general
dumb
with
amazement
the
holy
mother
only
speaks
latin
and
spanish
she
added
i
understand
neither
dear
antoinette
make
my
excuses
to
the
light
fell
full
upon
the
nun
s
figure
a
thrill
of
deep
emotion
betrayed
itself
in
a
faint
quiver
of
her
veil
as
she
heard
her
name
softly
spoken
by
the
man
who
had
been
so
hard
in
the
past
my
brother
she
said
drawing
her
sleeve
under
her
veil
perhaps
to
brush
tears
away
i
am
sister
then
turning
to
the
superior
she
spoke
in
spanish
the
general
knew
enough
of
the
language
to
understand
what
she
said
perfectly
well
possibly
he
could
have
spoken
it
had
he
chosen
to
do
so
dear
mother
the
gentleman
presents
his
respects
to
you
and
begs
you
to
pardon
him
if
he
can
not
pay
them
himself
but
he
knows
neither
of
the
languages
which
you
speak
the
aged
nun
bent
her
head
slowly
with
an
expression
of
angelic
sweetness
enhanced
at
the
same
time
by
the
consciousness
of
her
power
and
dignity
do
you
know
this
gentleman
she
asked
with
a
keen
glance
yes
go
back
to
your
cell
my
daughter
said
the
mother
imperiously
the
general
slipped
aside
behind
the
curtain
lest
the
dreadful
tumult
within
him
should
appear
in
his
face
even
in
the
shadow
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
still
see
the
superior
s
piercing
eyes
he
was
afraid
of
her
she
held
his
little
frail
happiness
in
her
hands
and
he
who
had
never
quailed
under
a
triple
row
of
guns
now
trembled
before
this
nun
the
duchess
went
towards
the
door
but
she
turned
back
mother
she
said
with
dreadful
calmness
the
frenchman
is
one
of
my
then
stay
my
daughter
said
the
superior
after
a
pause
the
piece
of
admirable
jesuitry
told
of
such
love
and
regret
that
a
man
less
strongly
constituted
might
have
broken
down
under
the
keen
delight
in
the
midst
of
a
great
and
for
him
an
entirely
novel
peril
oh
how
precious
words
looks
and
gestures
became
when
love
must
baffle
lynx
eyes
and
tiger
s
claws
sister
theresa
came
back
you
see
my
brother
what
i
have
dared
to
do
only
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
of
your
salvation
and
of
the
prayers
that
my
soul
puts
up
for
your
soul
daily
i
am
committing
mortal
sin
i
have
told
a
lie
how
many
days
of
penance
must
expiate
that
lie
but
i
shall
endure
it
for
your
sake
my
brother
you
do
not
know
what
happiness
it
is
to
love
in
heaven
to
feel
that
you
can
confess
love
purified
by
religion
love
transported
into
the
highest
heights
of
all
so
that
we
are
permitted
to
lose
sight
of
all
but
the
soul
if
the
doctrine
and
the
spirit
of
the
saint
to
whom
we
owe
this
refuge
had
not
raised
me
above
earth
s
anguish
and
caught
me
up
and
set
me
far
indeed
beneath
the
sphere
wherein
she
dwells
yet
truly
above
this
world
i
should
not
have
seen
you
again
but
now
i
can
see
you
and
hear
your
voice
and
remain
calm
the
general
broke
in
but
antoinette
let
me
see
you
you
whom
i
love
passionately
desperately
as
you
could
have
wished
me
to
love
do
not
call
me
antoinette
i
implore
you
memories
of
the
past
hurt
me
you
must
see
no
one
here
but
sister
theresa
a
creature
who
trusts
in
the
divine
she
paused
for
a
little
and
then
added
you
must
control
yourself
my
brother
our
mother
would
separate
us
without
pity
if
there
is
any
worldly
passion
in
your
face
or
if
you
allow
the
tears
to
fall
from
your
the
general
bowed
his
head
to
regain
when
he
looked
up
again
he
saw
her
face
beyond
the
grating
the
thin
white
but
still
impassioned
face
of
the
nun
all
the
magic
charm
of
youth
that
once
bloomed
there
all
the
fair
contrast
of
velvet
whiteness
and
the
colour
of
the
bengal
rose
had
given
place
to
a
burning
glow
as
of
a
porcelain
jar
with
a
faint
light
shining
through
it
the
wonderful
hair
in
which
she
took
such
pride
had
been
shaven
there
was
a
bandage
round
her
forehead
and
about
her
face
an
ascetic
life
had
left
dark
traces
about
the
eyes
which
still
sometimes
shot
out
fevered
glances
their
ordinary
calm
expression
was
but
a
veil
in
a
few
words
she
was
but
the
ghost
of
her
former
self
ah
you
that
have
come
to
be
my
life
you
must
come
out
of
this
tomb
you
were
mine
you
had
no
right
to
give
yourself
even
to
god
did
you
not
promise
me
to
give
up
all
at
the
least
command
from
me
you
may
perhaps
think
me
worthy
of
that
promise
now
when
you
hear
what
i
have
done
for
you
i
have
sought
you
all
through
the
world
you
have
been
in
my
thoughts
at
every
moment
for
five
years
my
life
has
been
given
to
you
my
friends
very
powerful
friends
as
you
know
have
helped
with
all
their
might
to
search
every
convent
in
france
italy
spain
sicily
and
america
love
burned
more
brightly
for
every
vain
search
again
and
again
i
made
long
journeys
with
a
false
hope
i
have
wasted
my
life
and
the
heaviest
throbbings
of
my
heart
in
vain
under
many
a
dark
convent
wall
i
am
not
speaking
of
a
faithfulness
that
knows
no
bounds
for
what
is
it
nothing
compared
with
the
infinite
longings
of
my
love
if
your
remorse
long
ago
was
sincere
you
ought
not
to
hesitate
to
follow
me
you
forget
that
i
am
not
the
duke
is
dead
he
answered
quickly
sister
theresa
flushed
red
may
heaven
be
open
to
him
she
cried
with
a
quick
rush
of
feeling
he
was
generous
to
but
i
did
not
mean
such
ties
it
was
one
of
my
sins
that
i
was
ready
to
break
them
all
without
scruple
for
are
you
speaking
of
your
vows
the
general
asked
frowning
i
did
not
think
that
anything
weighed
heavier
with
your
heart
than
love
but
do
not
think
twice
of
it
antoinette
the
holy
father
himself
shall
absolve
you
of
your
oath
i
will
surely
go
to
rome
i
will
entreat
all
the
powers
of
earth
if
god
could
come
down
from
heaven
i
would
do
not
so
do
not
fear
the
anger
of
god
ah
i
would
far
rather
hear
that
you
would
leave
your
prison
for
me
that
this
very
night
you
would
let
yourself
down
into
a
boat
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
and
we
would
go
away
to
be
happy
somewhere
at
the
world
s
end
i
know
not
where
and
with
me
at
your
side
you
should
come
back
to
life
and
health
under
the
wings
of
you
must
not
talk
like
this
said
sister
theresa
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
to
me
now
i
love
you
far
better
than
i
ever
loved
you
before
every
day
i
pray
for
you
i
see
you
with
other
eyes
armand
if
you
but
knew
the
happiness
of
giving
yourself
up
without
shame
to
a
pure
friendship
which
god
watches
over
you
do
not
know
what
joy
it
is
to
me
to
pray
for
heaven
s
blessing
on
you
i
never
pray
for
myself
god
will
do
with
me
according
to
his
will
but
at
the
price
of
my
soul
i
wish
i
could
be
sure
that
you
are
happy
here
on
earth
and
that
you
will
be
happy
hereafter
throughout
all
ages
my
eternal
life
is
all
that
trouble
has
left
me
to
offer
up
to
you
i
am
old
now
with
weeping
i
am
neither
young
nor
fair
and
in
any
case
you
could
not
respect
the
nun
who
became
a
wife
no
love
not
even
motherhood
could
give
me
absolution
what
can
you
say
to
outweigh
the
uncounted
thoughts
that
have
gathered
in
my
heart
during
the
past
five
years
thoughts
that
have
changed
and
worn
and
blighted
it
i
ought
to
have
given
a
heart
less
sorrowful
to
what
can
i
say
dear
antoinette
i
will
say
this
that
i
love
you
that
affection
love
a
great
love
the
joy
of
living
in
another
heart
that
is
ours
utterly
and
wholly
ours
is
so
rare
a
thing
and
so
hard
to
find
that
i
doubted
you
and
put
you
to
sharp
proof
but
now
today
i
love
you
antoinette
with
all
my
soul
s
strength
if
you
will
follow
me
into
solitude
i
will
hear
no
voice
but
yours
i
will
see
no
other
hush
armand
you
are
shortening
the
little
time
that
we
may
be
together
here
on
antoinette
will
you
come

mother
sister
theresa
called
aloud
in
spanish
i
have
lied
to
you
this
man
is
my
lover
the
curtain
fell
at
once
the
general
in
his
stupor
scarcely
heard
the
doors
within
as
they
clanged
ah
she
loves
me
still
he
cried
understanding
all
the
sublimity
of
that
cry
of
hers
she
loves
me
still
she
must
be
carried
off
the
general
left
the
island
returned
to
headquarters
pleaded
asked
for
leave
of
absence
and
forthwith
took
his
departure
for
france
and
now
for
the
incidents
which
brought
the
two
personages
in
this
scene
into
their
present
relation
to
each
other
the
thing
known
in
france
as
the
faubourg
is
neither
a
quarter
nor
a
sect
nor
an
institution
nor
anything
else
that
admits
of
a
precise
definition
there
are
great
houses
in
the
place
royale
the
faubourg
and
the
chaussee
d
antin
in
any
one
of
which
you
may
breathe
the
same
atmosphere
of
faubourg
so
to
begin
with
the
whole
faubourg
is
not
within
the
faubourg
there
are
men
and
women
born
far
enough
away
from
its
influences
who
respond
to
them
and
take
their
place
in
the
circle
and
again
there
are
others
born
within
its
limits
who
may
yet
be
driven
forth
forever
for
the
last
forty
years
the
manners
and
customs
and
speech
in
a
word
the
tradition
of
the
faubourg
has
been
to
paris
what
the
court
used
to
be
in
other
times
it
is
what
the
hotel
was
to
the
fourteenth
century
the
louvre
to
the
fifteenth
the
palais
the
hotel
rambouillet
and
the
place
royale
to
the
sixteenth
and
lastly
as
versailles
was
to
the
seventeenth
and
the
eighteenth
just
as
the
ordinary
workaday
paris
will
always
centre
about
some
point
so
through
all
periods
of
history
the
paris
of
the
nobles
and
the
upper
classes
converges
towards
some
particular
spot
it
is
a
periodically
recurrent
phenomenon
which
presents
ample
matter
for
reflection
to
those
who
are
fain
to
observe
or
describe
the
various
social
zones
and
possibly
an
enquiry
into
the
causes
that
bring
about
this
centralization
may
do
more
than
merely
justify
the
probability
of
this
episode
it
may
be
of
service
to
serious
interests
which
some
day
will
be
more
deeply
rooted
in
the
commonwealth
unless
indeed
experience
is
as
meaningless
for
political
parties
as
it
is
for
youth
in
every
age
the
great
nobles
and
the
rich
who
always
ape
the
great
nobles
build
their
houses
as
far
as
possible
from
crowded
streets
when
the
duc
d
uzes
built
his
splendid
hotel
in
the
rue
montmartre
in
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
and
set
the
fountain
at
his
gates
for
which
beneficent
action
to
say
nothing
of
his
other
virtues
he
was
held
in
such
veneration
that
the
whole
quarter
turned
out
in
a
body
to
follow
his
funeral
when
the
duke
i
say
chose
this
site
for
his
house
he
did
so
because
that
part
of
paris
was
almost
deserted
in
those
days
but
when
the
fortifications
were
pulled
down
and
the
market
gardens
beyond
the
line
of
the
boulevards
began
to
fill
with
houses
then
the
d
uzes
family
left
their
fine
mansion
and
in
our
time
it
was
occupied
by
a
banker
later
still
the
noblesse
began
to
find
themselves
out
of
their
element
among
shopkeepers
left
the
place
royale
and
the
centre
of
paris
for
good
and
crossed
the
river
to
breathe
freely
in
the
faubourg
where
palaces
were
reared
already
about
the
great
hotel
built
by
louis
xiv
for
the
duc
de
maine
the
benjamin
among
his
legitimated
offspring
and
indeed
for
people
accustomed
to
a
stately
life
can
there
be
more
unseemly
surroundings
than
the
bustle
the
mud
the
street
cries
the
bad
smells
and
narrow
thoroughfares
of
a
populous
quarter
the
very
habits
of
life
in
a
mercantile
or
manufacturing
district
are
completely
at
variance
with
the
lives
of
nobles
the
shopkeeper
and
artisan
are
just
going
to
bed
when
the
great
world
is
thinking
of
dinner
and
the
noisy
stir
of
life
begins
among
the
former
when
the
latter
have
gone
to
rest
their
day
s
calculations
never
coincide
the
one
class
represents
the
expenditure
the
other
the
receipts
consequently
their
manners
and
customs
are
diametrically
opposed
nothing
contemptuous
is
intended
by
this
statement
an
aristocracy
is
in
a
manner
the
intellect
of
the
social
system
as
the
middle
classes
and
the
proletariat
may
be
said
to
be
its
organizing
and
working
power
it
naturally
follows
that
these
forces
are
differently
situated
and
of
their
antagonism
there
is
bred
a
seeming
antipathy
produced
by
the
performance
of
different
functions
all
of
them
however
existing
for
one
common
end
such
social
dissonances
are
so
inevitably
the
outcome
of
any
charter
of
the
constitution
that
however
much
a
liberal
may
be
disposed
to
complain
of
them
as
of
treason
against
those
sublime
ideas
with
which
the
ambitious
plebeian
is
apt
to
cover
his
designs
he
would
none
the
less
think
it
a
preposterous
notion
that
le
prince
de
montmorency
for
instance
should
continue
to
live
in
the
rue
at
the
corner
of
the
street
which
bears
that
nobleman
s
name
or
that
le
duc
de
descendant
of
the
royal
house
of
scotland
should
have
his
hotel
at
the
angle
of
the
rue
marie
stuart
and
the
rue
montorgueil
ut
sunt
aut
non
the
grand
words
of
the
jesuit
might
be
taken
as
a
motto
by
the
great
in
all
countries
these
social
differences
are
patent
in
all
ages
the
fact
is
always
accepted
by
the
people
its
reasons
of
state
are
it
is
at
once
cause
and
effect
a
principle
and
a
law
the
common
sense
of
the
masses
never
deserts
them
until
demagogues
stir
them
up
to
gain
ends
of
their
own
that
common
sense
is
based
on
the
verities
of
social
order
and
the
social
order
is
the
same
everywhere
in
moscow
as
in
london
in
geneva
as
in
calcutta
given
a
certain
number
of
families
of
unequal
fortune
in
any
given
space
you
will
see
an
aristocracy
forming
under
your
eyes
there
will
be
the
patricians
the
upper
classes
and
yet
other
ranks
below
them
equality
may
be
a
but
no
power
on
earth
can
convert
it
into
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
france
if
this
idea
could
be
popularized
the
benefits
of
political
harmony
are
obvious
to
the
least
intelligent
classes
harmony
is
as
it
were
the
poetry
of
order
and
order
is
a
matter
of
vital
importance
to
the
working
population
and
what
is
order
reduced
to
its
simplest
expression
but
the
agreement
of
things
among
themselves
unity
in
short
architecture
music
and
poetry
everything
in
france
and
in
france
more
than
in
any
other
country
is
based
upon
this
principle
it
is
written
upon
the
very
foundations
of
her
clear
accurate
language
and
a
language
must
always
be
the
most
infallible
index
of
national
character
in
the
same
way
you
may
note
that
the
french
popular
airs
are
those
most
calculated
to
strike
the
imagination
the
melodies
are
taken
over
by
the
people
clearness
of
thought
the
intellectual
simplicity
of
an
idea
attracts
them
they
like
the
incisive
sayings
that
hold
the
greatest
number
of
ideas
france
is
the
one
country
in
the
world
where
a
little
phrase
may
bring
about
a
great
revolution
whenever
the
masses
have
risen
it
has
been
to
bring
men
affairs
and
principles
into
agreement
no
nation
has
a
clearer
conception
of
that
idea
of
unity
which
should
permeate
the
life
of
an
aristocracy
possibly
no
other
nation
has
so
intelligent
a
comprehension
of
a
political
necessity
history
will
never
find
her
behind
the
time
france
has
been
led
astray
many
a
time
but
she
is
deluded
by
generous
ideas
by
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
which
at
first
outstrips
sober
reason
so
to
begin
with
the
most
striking
characteristic
of
the
faubourg
is
the
splendour
of
its
great
mansions
its
great
gardens
and
a
surrounding
quiet
in
keeping
with
princely
revenues
drawn
from
great
estates
and
what
is
this
distance
set
between
a
class
and
a
whole
metropolis
but
visible
and
outward
expression
of
the
widely
different
attitude
of
mind
which
must
inevitably
keep
them
apart
the
position
of
the
head
is
well
defined
in
every
organism
if
by
any
chance
a
nation
allows
its
head
to
fall
at
its
feet
it
is
pretty
sure
sooner
or
later
to
discover
that
this
is
a
suicidal
measure
and
since
nations
have
no
desire
to
perish
they
set
to
work
at
once
to
grow
a
new
head
if
they
lack
the
strength
for
this
they
perish
as
rome
perished
and
venice
and
so
many
other
states
this
distinction
between
the
upper
and
lower
spheres
of
social
activity
emphasized
by
differences
in
their
manner
of
living
necessarily
implies
that
in
the
highest
aristocracy
there
is
real
worth
and
some
distinguishing
merit
in
any
state
no
matter
what
form
of
government
is
affected
so
soon
as
the
patrician
class
fails
to
maintain
that
complete
superiority
which
is
the
condition
of
its
existence
it
ceases
to
be
a
force
and
is
pulled
down
at
once
by
the
populace
the
people
always
wish
to
see
money
power
and
initiative
in
their
leaders
hands
hearts
and
heads
they
must
be
the
spokesmen
they
must
represent
the
intelligence
and
the
glory
of
the
nation
nations
like
women
love
strength
in
those
who
rule
them
they
can
not
give
love
without
respect
they
refuse
utterly
to
obey
those
of
whom
they
do
not
stand
in
awe
an
aristocracy
fallen
into
contempt
is
a
a
husband
in
petticoats
first
it
ceases
to
be
itself
and
then
it
ceases
to
be
and
in
this
way
the
isolation
of
the
great
the
sharply
marked
distinction
in
their
manner
of
life
or
in
a
word
the
general
custom
of
the
patrician
caste
is
at
once
the
sign
of
a
real
power
and
their
destruction
so
soon
as
that
power
is
lost
the
faubourg
failed
to
recognise
the
conditions
of
its
being
while
it
would
still
have
been
easy
to
perpetuate
its
existence
and
therefore
was
brought
low
for
a
time
the
faubourg
should
have
looked
the
facts
fairly
in
the
face
as
the
english
aristocracy
did
before
them
they
should
have
seen
that
every
institution
has
its
climacteric
periods
when
words
lose
their
old
meanings
and
ideas
reappear
in
a
new
guise
and
the
whole
conditions
of
politics
wear
a
changed
aspect
while
the
underlying
realities
undergo
no
essential
alteration
these
ideas
demand
further
development
which
form
an
essential
part
of
this
episode
they
are
given
here
both
as
a
succinct
statement
of
the
causes
and
an
explanation
of
the
things
which
happen
in
the
course
of
the
story
the
stateliness
of
the
castles
and
palaces
where
nobles
dwell
the
luxury
of
the
details
the
constantly
maintained
sumptuousness
of
the
furniture
the
atmosphere
in
which
the
fortunate
owner
of
landed
estates
a
rich
man
before
he
was
born
lives
and
moves
easily
and
without
friction
the
habit
of
mind
which
never
descends
to
calculate
the
petty
workaday
gains
of
existence
the
leisure
the
higher
education
attainable
at
a
much
earlier
age
and
lastly
the
aristocratic
tradition
that
makes
of
him
a
social
force
for
which
his
opponents
by
dint
of
study
and
a
strong
will
and
tenacity
of
vocation
are
scarcely
a
these
things
should
contribute
to
form
a
lofty
spirit
in
a
man
possessed
of
such
privileges
from
his
youth
up
they
should
stamp
his
character
with
that
high
of
which
the
least
consequence
is
a
nobleness
of
heart
in
harmony
with
the
noble
name
that
he
bears
and
in
some
few
families
all
this
is
realised
there
are
noble
characters
here
and
there
in
the
faubourg
but
they
are
marked
exceptions
to
a
general
rule
of
egoism
which
has
been
the
ruin
of
this
world
within
a
world
the
privileges
above
enumerated
are
the
birthright
of
the
french
noblesse
as
of
every
patrician
efflorescence
ever
formed
on
the
surface
of
a
nation
and
will
continue
to
be
theirs
so
long
as
their
existence
is
based
upon
real
estate
or
money
and
alike
the
only
solid
bases
of
an
organized
society
but
such
privileges
are
held
upon
the
understanding
that
the
patricians
must
continue
to
justify
their
existence
there
is
a
sort
of
moral
held
on
a
tenure
of
service
rendered
to
the
sovereign
and
here
in
france
the
people
are
undoubtedly
the
sovereigns
nowadays
the
times
are
changed
and
so
are
the
weapons
the
of
old
wore
a
coat
of
chain
armor
and
a
hauberk
he
could
handle
a
lance
well
and
display
his
pennon
and
no
more
was
required
of
him
today
he
is
bound
to
give
proof
of
his
intelligence
a
stout
heart
was
enough
in
the
days
of
old
in
our
days
he
is
required
to
have
a
capacious
skill
and
knowledge
and
capital
these
three
points
mark
out
a
social
triangle
on
which
the
scutcheon
of
power
is
blazoned
our
modern
aristocracy
must
take
its
stand
on
these
a
fine
theorem
is
as
good
as
a
great
name
the
rothschilds
the
fuggers
of
the
nineteenth
century
are
princes
a
great
artist
is
in
reality
an
oligarch
he
represents
a
whole
century
and
almost
always
he
is
a
law
to
others
and
the
art
of
words
the
high
pressure
machinery
of
the
writer
the
poet
s
genius
the
merchant
s
steady
endurance
the
strong
will
of
the
statesman
who
concentrates
a
thousand
dazzling
qualities
in
himself
the
general
s
sword
all
these
victories
in
short
which
a
single
individual
will
win
that
he
may
tower
above
the
rest
of
the
world
the
patrician
class
is
now
bound
to
win
and
keep
exclusively
they
must
head
the
new
forces
as
they
once
headed
the
material
forces
how
should
they
keep
the
position
unless
they
are
worthy
of
it
how
unless
they
are
the
soul
and
brain
of
a
nation
shall
they
set
its
hands
moving
how
lead
a
people
without
the
power
of
command
and
what
is
the
marshal
s
baton
without
the
innate
power
of
the
captain
in
the
man
who
wields
it
the
faubourg
took
to
playing
with
batons
and
fancied
that
all
the
power
was
in
its
hands
it
inverted
the
terms
of
the
proposition
which
called
it
into
existence
and
instead
of
flinging
away
the
insignia
which
offended
the
people
and
quietly
grasping
the
power
it
allowed
the
bourgeoisie
to
seize
the
authority
clung
with
fatal
obstinacy
to
its
shadow
and
over
and
over
again
forgot
the
laws
which
a
minority
must
observe
if
it
would
live
when
an
aristocracy
is
scarce
a
thousandth
part
of
the
body
social
it
is
bound
today
as
of
old
to
multiply
its
points
of
action
so
as
to
counterbalance
the
weight
of
the
masses
in
a
great
crisis
and
in
our
days
those
means
of
action
must
be
living
forces
and
not
historical
memories
in
france
unluckily
the
noblesse
were
still
so
puffed
up
with
the
notion
of
their
vanished
power
that
it
was
difficult
to
contend
against
a
kind
of
innate
presumption
in
themselves
perhaps
this
is
a
national
defect
the
frenchman
is
less
given
than
anyone
else
to
undervalue
himself
it
comes
natural
to
him
to
go
from
his
degree
to
the
one
above
it
and
while
it
is
a
rare
thing
for
him
to
pity
the
unfortunates
over
whose
heads
he
rises
he
always
groans
in
spirit
to
see
so
many
fortunate
people
above
him
he
is
very
far
from
heartless
but
too
often
he
prefers
to
listen
to
his
intellect
the
national
instinct
which
brings
the
frenchman
to
the
front
the
vanity
that
wastes
his
substance
is
as
much
a
dominant
passion
as
thrift
in
the
dutch
for
three
centuries
it
swayed
the
noblesse
who
in
this
respect
were
certainly
french
the
scion
of
the
faubourg
beholding
his
material
superiority
was
fully
persuaded
of
his
intellectual
superiority
and
everything
contributed
to
confirm
him
in
his
belief
for
ever
since
the
faubourg
existed
at
all
which
is
to
say
ever
since
versailles
ceased
to
be
the
royal
residence
the
faubourg
with
some
few
gaps
in
continuity
was
always
backed
up
by
the
central
power
which
in
france
seldom
fails
to
support
that
side
thence
its
downfall
in
at
that
time
the
party
of
the
faubourg
was
rather
like
an
army
without
a
base
of
operation
it
had
utterly
failed
to
take
advantage
of
the
peace
to
plant
itself
in
the
heart
of
the
nation
it
sinned
for
want
of
learning
its
lesson
and
through
an
utter
incapability
of
regarding
its
interests
as
a
whole
a
future
certainty
was
sacrificed
to
a
doubtful
present
gain
this
blunder
in
policy
may
perhaps
be
attributed
to
the
following
cause
the
so
strenuously
kept
up
by
the
noblesse
brought
about
fatal
results
during
the
last
forty
years
even
was
extinguished
by
it
and
rivalry
fostered
among
themselves
when
the
french
noblesse
of
other
times
were
rich
and
powerful
the
nobles
could
choose
their
chiefs
and
obey
them
in
the
hour
of
danger
as
their
power
diminished
they
grew
less
amenable
to
discipline
and
as
in
the
last
days
of
the
byzantine
empire
everyone
wished
to
be
emperor
they
mistook
their
uniform
weakness
for
uniform
strength
each
family
ruined
by
the
revolution
and
the
abolition
of
the
law
of
primogeniture
thought
only
of
itself
and
not
at
all
of
the
great
family
of
the
noblesse
it
seemed
to
them
that
as
each
individual
grew
rich
the
party
as
a
whole
would
gain
in
strength
and
herein
lay
their
mistake
money
likewise
is
only
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
power
all
these
families
were
made
up
of
persons
who
preserved
a
high
tradition
of
courtesy
of
true
graciousness
of
life
of
refined
speech
with
a
family
pride
and
a
squeamish
sense
of
which
suited
well
with
the
kind
of
life
they
led
a
life
wholly
filled
with
occupations
which
become
contemptible
so
soon
as
they
cease
to
be
accessories
and
take
the
chief
place
in
existence
there
was
a
certain
intrinsic
merit
in
all
these
people
but
the
merit
was
on
the
surface
and
none
of
them
were
worth
their
not
a
single
one
among
those
families
had
courage
to
ask
itself
the
question
are
we
strong
enough
for
the
responsibility
of
power
they
were
cast
on
the
top
like
the
lawyers
of
and
instead
of
taking
the
patron
s
place
like
a
great
man
the
faubourg
showed
itself
greedy
as
an
upstart
the
most
intelligent
nation
in
the
world
perceived
clearly
that
the
restored
nobles
were
organizing
everything
for
their
own
particular
benefit
from
that
day
the
noblesse
was
doomed
the
faubourg
tried
to
be
an
aristocracy
when
it
could
only
be
an
oligarchy
two
very
different
systems
as
any
man
may
see
for
himself
if
he
gives
an
intelligent
perusal
to
the
list
of
the
patronymics
of
the
house
of
peers
the
king
s
government
certainly
meant
well
but
the
maxim
that
the
people
must
be
made
to
everything
even
their
own
welfare
was
pretty
constantly
forgotten
nor
did
they
bear
in
mind
that
la
france
is
a
woman
and
capricious
and
must
be
happy
or
chastised
at
her
own
good
pleasure
if
there
had
been
many
dukes
like
the
duc
de
laval
whose
modesty
made
him
worthy
of
the
name
he
bore
the
elder
branch
would
have
been
as
securely
seated
on
the
throne
as
the
house
of
hanover
at
this
day
in
the
noblesse
of
france
were
called
upon
to
assert
their
superiority
over
the
most
aristocratic
bourgeoisie
in
the
most
feminine
of
all
countries
to
take
the
lead
in
the
most
highly
educated
epoch
the
world
had
yet
seen
and
this
was
even
more
notably
the
case
in
the
faubourg
might
very
easily
have
led
and
amused
the
middle
classes
in
days
when
people
s
heads
were
turned
with
distinctions
and
art
and
science
were
all
the
rage
but
the
leaders
of
a
time
of
great
intellectual
progress
all
of
them
detested
art
and
science
they
had
not
even
the
wit
to
present
religion
in
attractive
colours
though
they
needed
its
support
while
lamartine
lamennais
montalembert
and
other
writers
were
putting
new
life
and
elevation
into
men
s
ideas
of
religion
and
gilding
it
with
poetry
these
bunglers
in
the
government
chose
to
make
the
harshness
of
their
creed
felt
all
over
the
country
never
was
nation
in
a
more
tractable
humour
la
france
like
a
tired
woman
was
ready
to
agree
to
anything
never
was
mismanagement
so
clumsy
and
la
france
like
a
woman
would
have
forgiven
wrongs
more
easily
than
bungling
if
the
noblesse
meant
to
reinstate
themselves
the
better
to
found
a
strong
oligarchy
they
should
have
honestly
and
diligently
searched
their
houses
for
men
of
the
stamp
that
napoleon
used
they
should
have
turned
themselves
inside
out
to
see
if
peradventure
there
was
a
constitutionalist
richelieu
lurking
in
the
entrails
of
the
faubourg
and
if
that
genius
was
not
forthcoming
from
among
them
they
should
have
set
out
to
find
him
even
in
the
fireless
garret
where
he
might
happen
to
be
perishing
of
cold
they
should
have
assimilated
him
as
the
english
house
of
lords
continually
assimilates
aristocrats
made
by
chance
and
finally
ordered
him
to
be
ruthless
to
lop
away
the
old
wood
and
cut
the
tree
down
to
the
living
shoots
but
in
the
first
place
the
great
system
of
english
toryism
was
far
too
large
for
narrow
minds
the
importation
required
time
and
in
france
a
tardy
success
is
no
better
than
a
fiasco
so
far
moreover
from
adopting
a
policy
of
redemption
and
looking
for
new
forces
where
god
puts
them
these
petty
great
folk
took
a
dislike
to
any
capacity
that
did
not
issue
from
their
midst
and
lastly
instead
of
growing
young
again
the
faubourg
grew
positively
older
etiquette
not
an
institution
of
primary
necessity
might
have
been
maintained
if
it
had
appeared
only
on
state
occasions
but
as
it
was
there
was
a
daily
wrangle
over
precedence
it
ceased
to
be
a
matter
of
art
or
court
ceremonial
it
became
a
question
of
power
and
if
from
the
outset
the
crown
lacked
an
adviser
equal
to
so
great
a
crisis
the
aristocracy
was
still
more
lacking
in
a
sense
of
its
wider
interests
an
instinct
which
might
have
supplied
the
deficiency
they
stood
nice
about
de
talleyrand
s
marriage
when
de
talleyrand
was
the
one
man
among
them
with
the
brains
that
can
forge
a
new
political
system
and
begin
a
new
career
of
glory
for
a
nation
the
faubourg
scoffed
at
a
minister
if
he
was
not
gently
born
and
produced
no
one
of
gentle
birth
that
was
fit
to
be
a
minister
there
were
plenty
of
nobles
fitted
to
serve
their
country
by
raising
the
dignity
of
justices
of
the
peace
by
improving
the
land
by
opening
out
roads
and
canals
and
taking
an
active
and
leading
part
as
country
gentlemen
but
these
had
sold
their
estates
to
gamble
on
the
stock
exchange
again
the
faubourg
might
have
absorbed
the
energetic
men
among
the
bourgeoisie
and
opened
their
ranks
to
the
ambition
which
was
undermining
authority
they
preferred
instead
to
fight
and
to
fight
unarmed
for
of
all
that
they
once
possessed
there
was
nothing
left
but
tradition
for
their
misfortune
there
was
just
precisely
enough
of
their
former
wealth
left
them
as
a
class
to
keep
up
their
bitter
pride
they
were
content
with
their
past
not
one
of
them
seriously
thought
of
bidding
the
son
of
the
house
take
up
arms
from
the
pile
of
weapons
which
the
nineteenth
century
flings
down
in
the
young
men
shut
out
from
office
were
dancing
at
madame
s
balls
while
they
should
have
been
doing
the
work
done
under
the
republic
and
the
empire
by
young
conscientious
harmlessly
employed
energies
it
was
their
place
to
carry
out
at
paris
the
programme
which
their
seniors
should
have
been
following
in
the
country
the
heads
of
houses
might
have
won
back
recognition
of
their
titles
by
unremitting
attention
to
local
interests
by
falling
in
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
by
recasting
their
order
to
suit
the
taste
of
the
times
but
pent
up
together
in
the
faubourg
where
the
spirit
of
the
ancient
court
and
traditions
of
bygone
feuds
between
the
nobles
and
the
crown
still
lingered
on
the
aristocracy
was
not
in
its
allegiance
to
the
tuileries
and
so
much
the
more
easily
defeated
because
it
was
concentrated
in
the
chamber
of
peers
and
badly
organized
even
there
if
the
noblesse
had
woven
themselves
into
a
network
over
the
country
they
could
have
held
their
own
but
cooped
up
in
their
faubourg
with
their
backs
against
the
chateau
or
spread
at
full
length
over
the
budget
a
single
blow
cut
the
thread
of
a
life
and
a
petty
lawyer
came
forward
with
the
axe
in
spite
of
s
admirable
discourse
the
hereditary
peerage
and
law
of
entail
fell
before
the
lampoons
of
a
man
who
made
it
a
boast
that
he
had
adroitly
argued
some
few
heads
out
of
the
executioner
s
clutches
and
now
forsooth
must
clumsily
proceed
to
the
slaying
of
old
institutions
there
are
examples
and
lessons
for
the
future
in
all
this
for
if
there
were
not
still
a
future
before
the
french
aristocracy
there
would
be
no
need
to
do
more
than
find
a
suitable
sarcophagus
it
were
something
pitilessly
cruel
to
burn
the
dead
body
of
it
with
fire
of
tophet
but
though
the
surgeon
s
scalpel
is
ruthless
it
sometimes
gives
back
life
to
a
dying
man
and
the
faubourg
may
wax
more
powerful
under
persecution
than
in
its
day
of
triumph
if
it
but
chooses
to
organize
itself
under
a
leader
and
now
it
is
easy
to
give
a
summary
of
this
survey
the
wish
to
a
large
fortune
was
uppermost
in
everyone
s
mind
a
lack
of
broad
views
and
a
mass
of
small
defects
a
real
need
of
religion
as
a
political
factor
combined
with
a
thirst
for
pleasure
which
damaged
the
cause
of
religion
and
necessitated
a
good
deal
of
hypocrisy
a
certain
attitude
of
protest
on
the
part
of
loftier
and
men
who
set
their
faces
against
court
jealousies
and
the
disaffection
of
the
provincial
families
who
often
came
of
purer
descent
than
the
nobles
of
the
court
which
alienated
them
from
itself
all
these
things
combined
to
bring
about
a
most
discordant
state
of
things
in
the
faubourg
it
was
neither
compact
in
its
organisation
nor
consequent
in
its
action
neither
completely
moral
nor
frankly
dissolute
it
did
not
corrupt
nor
was
it
corrupted
it
would
neither
wholly
abandon
the
disputed
points
which
damaged
its
cause
nor
yet
adopt
the
policy
that
might
have
saved
it
in
short
however
effete
individuals
might
be
the
party
as
a
whole
was
none
the
less
armed
with
all
the
great
principles
which
lie
at
the
roots
of
national
existence
what
was
there
in
the
faubourg
that
it
should
perish
in
its
strength
it
was
very
hard
to
please
in
the
choice
of
candidates
the
faubourg
had
good
taste
it
was
scornfully
fastidious
yet
there
was
nothing
very
glorious
nor
chivalrous
truly
about
its
fall
in
the
emigration
of
there
were
some
traces
of
a
loftier
feeling
but
in
the
emigration
of
from
paris
into
the
country
there
was
nothing
discernible
but
a
few
famous
men
of
letters
a
few
oratorical
triumphs
in
the
chambers
de
talleyrand
s
attitude
in
the
congress
the
taking
of
algiers
and
not
a
few
names
that
found
their
way
from
the
battlefield
into
the
pages
of
history
all
these
things
were
so
many
examples
set
before
the
french
noblesse
to
show
that
it
was
still
open
to
them
to
take
their
part
in
the
national
existence
and
to
win
recognition
of
their
claims
if
indeed
they
could
condescend
thus
far
in
every
living
organism
the
work
of
bringing
the
whole
into
harmony
within
itself
is
always
going
on
if
a
man
is
indolent
the
indolence
shows
itself
in
everything
that
he
does
and
in
the
same
manner
the
general
spirit
of
a
class
is
pretty
plainly
manifested
in
the
face
it
turns
on
the
world
and
the
soul
informs
the
body
the
women
of
the
restoration
displayed
neither
the
proud
disregard
of
public
opinion
shown
by
the
court
ladies
of
olden
time
in
their
wantonness
nor
yet
the
simple
grandeur
of
the
tardy
virtues
by
which
they
expiated
their
sins
and
shed
so
bright
a
glory
about
their
names
there
was
nothing
either
very
frivolous
or
very
serious
about
the
woman
of
the
restoration
she
was
hypocritical
as
a
rule
in
her
passion
and
compounded
so
to
speak
with
its
pleasures
some
few
families
led
the
domestic
life
of
the
duchesse
d
orleans
whose
connubial
couch
was
exhibited
so
absurdly
to
visitors
at
the
palais
royal
two
or
three
kept
up
the
traditions
of
the
regency
filling
cleverer
women
with
something
like
disgust
the
great
lady
of
the
new
school
exercised
no
influence
at
all
over
the
manners
of
the
time
and
yet
she
might
have
done
much
she
might
at
worst
have
presented
as
dignified
a
spectacle
as
of
the
same
rank
but
she
hesitated
feebly
among
old
precedents
became
a
bigot
by
force
of
circumstances
and
allowed
nothing
of
herself
to
appear
not
even
her
better
qualities
not
one
among
the
frenchwomen
of
that
day
had
the
ability
to
create
a
salon
whither
leaders
of
fashion
might
come
to
take
lessons
in
taste
and
elegance
their
voices
which
once
laid
down
the
law
to
literature
that
living
expression
of
a
time
now
counted
absolutely
for
nought
now
when
a
literature
lacks
a
general
system
it
fails
to
shape
a
body
for
itself
and
dies
out
with
its
period
when
in
a
nation
at
any
time
there
is
a
people
apart
thus
constituted
the
historian
is
pretty
certain
to
find
some
representative
figure
some
central
personage
who
embodies
the
qualities
and
the
defects
of
the
whole
party
to
which
he
belongs
there
is
coligny
for
instance
among
the
huguenots
the
coadjuteur
in
the
time
of
the
fronde
the
marechal
de
richelieu
under
louis
xv
danton
during
the
terror
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
the
man
should
be
identified
with
the
company
in
which
history
finds
him
how
is
it
possible
to
lead
a
party
without
conforming
to
its
ideas
or
to
shine
in
any
epoch
unless
a
man
represents
the
ideas
of
his
time
the
wise
and
prudent
head
of
a
party
is
continually
obliged
to
bow
to
the
prejudices
and
follies
of
its
rear
and
this
is
the
cause
of
actions
for
which
he
is
afterwards
criticised
by
this
or
that
historian
sitting
at
a
safer
distance
from
terrific
popular
explosions
coolly
judging
the
passion
and
ferment
without
which
the
great
struggles
of
the
world
could
not
be
carried
on
at
all
and
if
this
is
true
of
the
historical
comedy
of
the
centuries
it
is
equally
true
in
a
more
restricted
sphere
in
the
detached
scenes
of
the
national
drama
known
as
the
of
the
at
the
beginning
of
that
ephemeral
life
led
by
the
faubourg
under
the
restoration
to
which
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
above
reflections
they
failed
to
give
stability
the
most
perfect
type
of
the
aristocratic
caste
in
its
weakness
and
strength
its
greatness
and
littleness
might
have
been
found
for
a
brief
space
in
a
young
married
woman
who
belonged
to
it
this
was
a
woman
artificially
educated
but
in
reality
ignorant
a
woman
whose
instincts
and
feelings
were
lofty
while
the
thought
which
should
have
controlled
them
was
wanting
she
squandered
the
wealth
of
her
nature
in
obedience
to
social
conventions
she
was
ready
to
brave
society
yet
she
hesitated
till
her
scruples
degenerated
into
artifice
with
more
wilfulness
than
real
force
of
character
impressionable
rather
than
enthusiastic
gifted
with
more
brain
than
heart
she
was
supremely
a
woman
supremely
a
coquette
and
above
all
things
a
parisienne
loving
a
brilliant
life
and
gaiety
reflecting
never
or
too
late
imprudent
to
the
verge
of
poetry
and
humble
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
in
spite
of
her
charming
insolence
like
some
reed
she
made
a
show
of
independence
yet
like
the
reed
she
was
ready
to
bend
to
a
strong
hand
she
talked
much
of
religion
and
had
it
not
at
heart
though
she
was
prepared
to
find
in
it
a
solution
of
her
life
how
explain
a
creature
so
complex
capable
of
heroism
yet
sinking
unconsciously
from
heroic
heights
to
utter
a
spiteful
word
young
and
not
so
much
old
at
heart
as
aged
by
the
maxims
of
those
about
her
versed
in
a
selfish
philosophy
in
which
she
was
all
unpractised
she
had
all
the
vices
of
a
courtier
all
the
nobleness
of
developing
womanhood
she
trusted
nothing
and
no
one
yet
there
were
times
when
she
quitted
her
sceptical
attitude
for
a
submissive
credulity
how
should
any
portrait
be
anything
but
incomplete
of
her
in
whom
the
play
of
colour
made
discord
only
to
produce
a
poetic
confusion
for
in
her
there
shone
a
divine
brightness
a
radiance
of
youth
that
blended
all
her
bewildering
characteristics
in
a
certain
completeness
and
unity
informed
by
her
charm
nothing
was
feigned
the
passion
or
the
ineffectual
high
aspirations
the
actual
pettiness
the
coolness
of
sentiment
and
warmth
of
impulse
were
all
spontaneous
and
unaffected
and
as
much
the
outcome
of
her
own
position
as
of
the
position
of
the
aristocracy
to
which
she
belonged
she
was
wholly
she
put
herself
proudly
above
the
world
and
beneath
the
shelter
of
her
name
there
was
something
of
the
egoism
of
medea
in
her
life
as
in
the
life
of
the
aristocracy
that
lay
and
would
not
so
much
as
raise
itself
or
stretch
out
a
hand
to
any
political
physician
so
well
aware
of
its
feebleness
or
so
conscious
that
it
was
already
dust
that
it
refused
to
touch
or
be
touched
the
duchesse
de
langeais
for
that
was
her
name
had
been
married
for
about
four
years
when
the
restoration
was
finally
consummated
which
is
to
say
in
by
that
time
the
revolution
of
the
hundred
days
had
let
in
the
light
on
the
mind
of
louis
xviii
in
spite
of
his
surroundings
he
comprehended
the
situation
and
the
age
in
which
he
was
living
and
it
was
only
later
when
this
louis
xi
without
the
axe
lay
stricken
down
by
disease
that
those
about
him
got
the
upper
hand
the
duchesse
de
langeais
a
navarreins
by
birth
came
of
a
ducal
house
which
had
made
a
point
of
never
marrying
below
its
rank
since
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
every
daughter
of
the
house
must
sooner
or
later
take
a
at
court
so
antoinette
de
navarreins
at
the
age
of
eighteen
came
out
of
the
profound
solitude
in
which
her
girlhood
had
been
spent
to
marry
the
duc
de
langeais
eldest
son
the
two
families
at
that
time
were
living
quite
out
of
the
world
but
after
the
invasion
of
france
the
return
of
the
bourbons
seemed
to
every
royalist
mind
the
only
possible
way
of
putting
an
end
to
the
miseries
of
the
war
the
ducs
de
navarreins
and
de
langeais
had
been
faithful
throughout
to
the
exiled
princes
nobly
resisting
all
the
temptations
of
glory
under
the
empire
under
the
circumstances
they
naturally
followed
out
the
old
family
policy
and
mlle
antoinette
a
beautiful
and
portionless
girl
was
married
to
le
marquis
de
langeais
only
a
few
months
before
the
death
of
the
duke
his
father
after
the
return
of
the
bourbons
the
families
resumed
their
rank
offices
and
dignity
at
court
once
more
they
entered
public
life
from
which
hitherto
they
held
aloof
and
took
their
place
high
on
the
sunlit
summits
of
the
new
political
world
in
that
time
of
general
baseness
and
sham
political
conversions
the
public
conscience
was
glad
to
recognise
the
unstained
loyalty
of
the
two
houses
and
a
consistency
in
political
and
private
life
for
which
all
parties
involuntarily
respected
them
but
unfortunately
as
so
often
happens
in
a
time
of
transition
the
most
disinterested
persons
the
men
whose
loftiness
of
view
and
wise
principles
would
have
gained
the
confidence
of
the
french
nation
and
led
them
to
believe
in
the
generosity
of
a
novel
and
spirited
policy
these
men
to
repeat
were
taken
out
of
affairs
and
public
business
was
allowed
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
others
who
found
it
to
their
interest
to
push
principles
to
their
extreme
consequences
by
way
of
proving
their
devotion
the
families
of
langeais
and
navarreins
remained
about
the
court
condemned
to
perform
the
duties
required
by
court
ceremonial
amid
the
reproaches
and
sneers
of
the
liberal
party
they
were
accused
of
gorging
themselves
with
riches
and
honours
and
all
the
while
their
family
estates
were
no
larger
than
before
and
liberal
allowances
from
the
civil
list
were
wholly
expended
in
keeping
up
the
state
necessary
for
any
european
government
even
if
it
be
a
republic
in
le
duc
de
langeais
commanded
a
division
of
the
army
and
the
duchess
held
a
post
about
one
of
the
princesses
in
virtue
of
which
she
was
free
to
live
in
paris
and
apart
from
her
husband
without
scandal
the
duke
moreover
besides
his
military
duties
had
a
place
at
court
to
which
he
came
during
his
term
of
waiting
leaving
his
in
command
the
duke
and
duchess
were
leading
lives
entirely
apart
the
world
none
the
wiser
their
marriage
of
convention
shared
the
fate
of
nearly
all
family
arrangements
of
the
kind
two
more
antipathetic
dispositions
could
not
well
have
been
found
they
were
brought
together
they
jarred
upon
each
other
there
was
soreness
on
either
side
then
they
were
divided
once
for
all
then
they
went
their
separate
ways
with
a
due
regard
for
appearances
the
duc
de
langeais
by
nature
as
methodical
as
the
chevalier
de
folard
himself
gave
himself
up
methodically
to
his
own
tastes
and
amusements
and
left
his
wife
at
liberty
to
do
as
she
pleased
so
soon
as
he
felt
sure
of
her
character
he
recognised
in
her
a
spirit
proud
a
cold
heart
a
profound
submissiveness
to
the
usages
of
the
world
and
a
youthful
loyalty
under
the
eyes
of
great
relations
with
the
light
of
a
prudish
and
bigoted
court
turned
full
upon
the
duchess
his
honour
was
safe
so
the
duke
calmly
did
as
the
of
the
eighteenth
century
did
before
him
and
left
a
young
wife
of
to
her
own
devices
he
had
deeply
offended
that
wife
and
in
her
nature
there
was
one
appalling
characteristic
she
would
never
forgive
an
offence
when
woman
s
vanity
and
with
all
that
was
best
in
her
nature
perhaps
had
been
slighted
wounded
in
secret
insult
and
injury
in
the
face
of
the
world
a
woman
loves
to
forget
there
is
a
way
open
to
her
of
showing
herself
great
she
is
a
woman
in
her
forgiveness
but
a
secret
offence
women
never
pardon
for
secret
baseness
as
for
hidden
virtues
and
hidden
love
they
have
no
kindness
this
was
mme
la
duchesse
de
langeais
real
position
unknown
to
the
world
she
herself
did
not
reflect
upon
it
it
was
the
time
of
the
rejoicings
over
the
duc
de
berri
s
marriage
the
court
and
the
faubourg
roused
itself
from
its
listlessness
and
reserve
this
was
the
real
beginning
of
that
splendour
which
the
government
of
the
restoration
carried
too
far
at
that
time
the
duchess
whether
for
reasons
of
her
own
or
from
vanity
never
appeared
in
public
without
a
following
of
women
equally
distinguished
by
name
and
fortune
as
queen
of
fashion
she
had
her
d
her
ladies
who
modeled
their
manner
and
their
wit
on
hers
they
had
been
cleverly
chosen
none
of
her
satellites
belonged
to
the
inmost
court
circle
nor
to
the
highest
level
of
the
faubourg
but
they
had
set
their
minds
upon
admission
to
those
inner
sanctuaries
being
as
yet
simple
denominations
they
wished
to
rise
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
throne
and
mingle
with
the
seraphic
powers
in
the
high
sphere
known
as
petit
thus
surrounded
the
duchess
s
position
was
stronger
and
more
commanding
and
secure
her
ladies
defended
her
character
and
helped
her
to
play
her
detestable
part
of
a
woman
of
fashion
she
could
laugh
at
men
at
her
ease
play
with
fire
receive
the
homage
on
which
the
feminine
nature
is
nourished
and
remain
mistress
of
herself
at
paris
in
the
highest
society
of
all
a
woman
is
a
woman
still
she
lives
on
incense
adulation
and
honours
no
beauty
however
undoubted
no
face
however
fair
is
anything
without
admiration
flattery
and
a
lover
are
proofs
of
power
and
what
is
power
without
recognition
nothing
if
the
prettiest
of
women
were
left
alone
in
a
corner
of
a
she
would
droop
put
her
in
the
very
centre
and
summit
of
social
grandeur
she
will
at
once
aspire
to
reign
over
all
hearts
often
because
it
is
out
of
her
power
to
be
the
happy
queen
of
one
dress
and
manner
and
coquetry
are
all
meant
to
please
one
of
the
poorest
creatures
extant
the
brainless
coxcomb
whose
handsome
face
is
his
sole
merit
it
was
for
such
as
these
that
women
threw
themselves
away
the
gilded
wooden
idols
of
the
restoration
for
they
were
neither
more
nor
less
had
neither
the
antecedents
of
the
of
the
time
of
the
fronde
nor
the
rough
sterling
worth
of
napoleon
s
heroes
not
the
wit
and
fine
manners
of
their
grandsires
but
something
of
all
three
they
meant
to
be
without
any
trouble
to
themselves
brave
they
were
like
all
young
frenchmen
ability
they
possessed
no
doubt
if
they
had
had
a
chance
of
proving
it
but
their
places
were
filled
up
by
the
old
men
who
kept
them
in
leading
strings
it
was
a
day
of
small
things
a
cold
prosaic
era
perhaps
it
takes
a
long
time
for
a
restoration
to
become
a
monarchy
for
the
past
eighteen
months
the
duchesse
de
langeais
had
been
leading
this
empty
life
filled
with
balls
and
subsequent
visits
objectless
triumphs
and
the
transient
loves
that
spring
up
and
die
in
an
evening
s
space
all
eyes
were
turned
on
her
when
she
entered
a
room
she
reaped
her
harvest
of
flatteries
and
some
few
words
of
warmer
admiration
which
she
encouraged
by
a
gesture
or
a
glance
but
never
suffered
to
penetrate
deeper
than
the
skin
her
tone
and
bearing
and
everything
else
about
her
imposed
her
will
upon
others
her
life
was
a
sort
of
fever
of
vanity
and
perpetual
enjoyment
which
turned
her
head
she
was
daring
enough
in
conversation
she
would
listen
to
anything
corrupting
the
surface
as
it
were
of
her
heart
yet
when
she
returned
home
she
often
blushed
at
the
story
that
had
made
her
laugh
at
the
scandalous
tale
that
supplied
the
details
on
the
strength
of
which
she
analyzed
the
love
that
she
had
never
known
and
marked
the
subtle
distinctions
of
modern
passion
not
with
comment
on
the
part
of
complacent
hypocrites
for
women
know
how
to
say
everything
among
themselves
and
more
of
them
are
ruined
by
each
other
than
corrupted
by
men
there
came
a
moment
when
she
discerned
that
not
until
a
woman
is
loved
will
the
world
fully
recognise
her
beauty
and
her
wit
what
does
a
husband
prove
simply
that
a
girl
or
woman
was
endowed
with
wealth
or
well
brought
up
that
her
mother
managed
cleverly
that
in
some
way
she
satisfied
a
man
s
ambitions
a
lover
constantly
bears
witness
to
her
personal
perfections
then
followed
the
discovery
still
in
mme
de
langeais
early
womanhood
that
it
was
possible
to
be
loved
without
committing
herself
without
permission
without
vouchsafing
any
satisfaction
beyond
the
most
meagre
dues
there
was
more
than
one
demure
feminine
hypocrite
to
instruct
her
in
the
art
of
playing
such
dangerous
comedies
so
the
duchess
had
her
court
and
the
number
of
her
adorers
and
courtiers
guaranteed
her
virtue
she
was
amiable
and
fascinating
she
flirted
till
the
ball
or
the
evening
s
gaiety
was
at
an
end
then
the
curtain
dropped
she
was
cold
indifferent
again
till
the
next
day
brought
its
renewed
sensations
superficial
as
before
two
or
three
men
were
completely
deceived
and
fell
in
love
in
earnest
she
laughed
at
them
she
was
utterly
insensible
i
am
loved
she
told
herself
he
loves
me
the
certainty
sufficed
her
it
is
enough
for
the
miser
to
know
that
his
every
whim
might
be
fulfilled
if
he
chose
so
it
was
with
the
duchess
and
perhaps
she
did
not
even
go
so
far
as
to
form
a
wish
one
evening
she
chanced
to
be
at
the
house
of
an
intimate
friend
mme
la
vicomtesse
de
fontaine
one
of
the
humble
rivals
who
cordially
detested
her
and
went
with
her
everywhere
in
a
friendship
of
this
sort
both
sides
are
on
their
guard
and
never
lay
their
armor
aside
confidences
are
ingeniously
indiscreet
and
not
unfrequently
treacherous
mme
de
langeais
had
distributed
her
little
patronizing
friendly
or
freezing
bows
with
the
air
natural
to
a
woman
who
knows
the
worth
of
her
smiles
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
total
stranger
something
in
the
man
s
large
gravity
of
aspect
startled
her
and
with
a
feeling
almost
like
dread
she
turned
to
mme
de
maufrigneuse
with
who
is
the
newcomer
dear
someone
that
you
have
heard
of
no
doubt
the
marquis
de
oh
is
it
he
she
took
up
her
eyeglass
and
submitted
him
to
a
very
insolent
scrutiny
as
if
he
had
been
a
picture
meant
to
receive
glances
not
to
return
them
do
introduce
him
he
ought
to
be
nobody
more
tiresome
and
dull
dear
but
he
is
the
armand
de
montriveau
at
that
moment
all
unwittingly
the
object
of
general
curiosity
better
deserved
attention
than
any
of
the
idols
that
paris
needs
must
set
up
to
worship
for
a
brief
space
for
the
city
is
vexed
by
periodical
fits
of
craving
a
passion
for
and
sham
enthusiasm
which
must
be
satisfied
the
marquis
was
the
only
son
of
general
de
montriveau
one
of
the
who
served
the
republic
nobly
and
fell
by
joubert
s
side
at
novi
bonaparte
had
placed
his
son
at
the
school
at
chalons
with
the
orphans
of
other
generals
who
fell
on
the
battlefield
leaving
their
children
under
the
protection
of
the
republic
armand
de
montriveau
left
school
with
his
way
to
make
entered
the
artillery
and
had
only
reached
a
major
s
rank
at
the
time
of
the
fontainebleau
disaster
in
his
section
of
the
service
the
chances
of
advancement
were
not
many
there
are
fewer
officers
in
the
first
place
among
the
gunners
than
in
any
other
corps
and
in
the
second
place
the
feeling
in
the
artillery
was
decidedly
liberal
not
to
say
republican
and
the
emperor
feeling
little
confidence
in
a
body
of
highly
educated
men
who
were
apt
to
think
for
themselves
gave
promotion
grudgingly
in
the
service
in
the
artillery
accordingly
the
general
rule
of
the
army
did
not
apply
the
commanding
officers
were
not
invariably
the
most
remarkable
men
in
their
department
because
there
was
less
to
be
feared
from
mediocrities
the
artillery
was
a
separate
corps
in
those
days
and
only
came
under
napoleon
in
action
besides
these
general
causes
other
reasons
inherent
in
armand
de
montriveau
s
character
were
sufficient
in
themselves
to
account
for
his
tardy
promotion
he
was
alone
in
the
world
he
had
been
thrown
at
the
age
of
twenty
into
the
whirlwind
of
men
directed
by
napoleon
his
interests
were
bounded
by
himself
any
day
he
might
lose
his
life
it
became
a
habit
of
mind
with
him
to
live
by
his
own
and
the
consciousness
that
he
had
done
his
duty
like
all
shy
men
he
was
habitually
silent
but
his
shyness
sprang
by
no
means
from
timidity
it
was
a
kind
of
modesty
in
him
he
found
any
demonstration
of
vanity
intolerable
there
was
no
sort
of
swagger
about
his
fearlessness
in
action
nothing
escaped
his
eyes
he
could
give
sensible
advice
to
his
chums
with
unshaken
coolness
he
could
go
under
fire
and
duck
upon
occasion
to
avoid
bullets
he
was
kindly
but
his
expression
was
haughty
and
stern
and
his
face
gained
him
this
character
in
everything
he
was
rigorous
as
arithmetic
he
never
permitted
the
slightest
deviation
from
duty
on
any
plausible
pretext
nor
blinked
the
consequences
of
a
fact
he
would
lend
himself
to
nothing
of
which
he
was
ashamed
he
never
asked
anything
for
himself
in
short
armand
de
montriveau
was
one
of
many
great
men
unknown
to
fame
and
philosophical
enough
to
despise
it
living
without
attaching
themselves
to
life
because
they
have
not
found
their
opportunity
of
developing
to
the
full
their
power
to
do
and
feel
people
were
afraid
of
montriveau
they
respected
him
but
he
was
not
very
popular
men
may
indeed
allow
you
to
rise
above
them
but
to
decline
to
descend
as
low
as
they
can
do
is
the
one
unpardonable
sin
in
their
feeling
towards
loftier
natures
there
is
a
trace
of
hate
and
fear
too
much
honour
with
them
implies
censure
of
themselves
a
thing
forgiven
neither
to
the
living
nor
to
the
dead
after
the
emperor
s
farewells
at
fontainebleau
montriveau
noble
though
he
was
was
put
on
perhaps
the
heads
of
the
war
office
took
fright
at
uncompromising
uprightness
worthy
of
antiquity
or
perhaps
it
was
known
that
he
felt
bound
by
his
oath
to
the
imperial
eagle
during
the
hundred
days
he
was
made
a
colonel
of
the
guard
and
left
on
the
field
of
waterloo
his
wounds
kept
him
in
belgium
he
was
not
present
at
the
disbanding
of
the
army
of
the
loire
but
the
king
s
government
declined
to
recognise
promotion
made
during
the
hundred
days
and
armand
de
montriveau
left
france
an
adventurous
spirit
a
loftiness
of
thought
hitherto
satisfied
by
the
hazards
of
war
drove
him
on
an
exploring
expedition
through
upper
egypt
his
sanity
or
impulse
directed
his
enthusiasm
to
a
project
of
great
importance
he
turned
his
attention
to
that
unexplored
central
africa
which
occupies
the
learned
of
today
the
scientific
expedition
was
long
and
unfortunate
he
had
made
a
valuable
collection
of
notes
bearing
on
various
geographical
and
commercial
problems
of
which
solutions
are
still
eagerly
sought
and
succeeded
after
surmounting
many
obstacles
in
reaching
the
heart
of
the
continent
when
he
was
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
a
hostile
native
tribe
then
stripped
of
all
that
he
had
for
two
years
he
led
a
wandering
life
in
the
desert
the
slave
of
savages
threatened
with
death
at
every
moment
and
more
cruelly
treated
than
a
dumb
animal
in
the
power
of
pitiless
children
physical
strength
and
a
mind
braced
to
endurance
enabled
him
to
survive
the
horrors
of
that
captivity
but
his
miraculous
escape
exhausted
his
energies
when
he
reached
the
french
colony
at
senegal
a
fugitive
covered
with
rags
his
memories
of
his
former
life
were
dim
and
shapeless
the
great
sacrifices
made
in
his
travels
were
all
forgotten
like
his
studies
of
african
dialects
his
discoveries
and
observations
one
story
will
give
an
idea
of
all
that
he
passed
through
once
for
several
days
the
children
of
the
sheikh
of
the
tribe
amused
themselves
by
putting
him
up
for
a
mark
and
flinging
horses
at
his
head
montriveau
came
back
to
paris
in
a
ruined
man
he
had
no
interest
and
wished
for
none
he
would
have
died
twenty
times
over
sooner
than
ask
a
favour
of
anyone
he
would
not
even
press
the
recognition
of
his
claims
adversity
and
hardship
had
developed
his
energy
even
in
trifles
while
the
habit
of
preserving
his
before
that
spiritual
self
which
we
call
conscience
led
him
to
attach
consequence
to
the
most
apparently
trivial
actions
his
merits
and
adventures
became
known
however
through
his
acquaintances
among
the
principal
men
of
science
in
paris
and
some
few
military
men
the
incidents
of
his
slavery
and
subsequent
escape
bore
witness
to
a
courage
intelligence
and
coolness
which
won
him
celebrity
without
his
knowledge
and
that
transient
fame
of
which
paris
salons
are
lavish
though
the
artist
that
fain
would
keep
it
must
make
untold
efforts
montriveau
s
position
suddenly
changed
towards
the
end
of
that
year
he
had
been
a
poor
man
he
was
now
rich
or
externally
at
any
rate
he
had
all
the
advantages
of
wealth
the
king
s
government
trying
to
attach
capable
men
to
itself
and
to
strengthen
the
army
made
concessions
about
that
time
to
napoleon
s
old
officers
if
their
known
loyalty
and
character
offered
guarantees
of
fidelity
de
montriveau
s
name
once
more
appeared
in
the
army
list
with
the
rank
of
colonel
he
received
his
arrears
of
pay
and
passed
into
the
guards
all
these
favours
one
after
another
came
to
seek
the
marquis
de
montriveau
he
had
asked
for
nothing
however
small
friends
had
taken
the
steps
for
him
which
he
would
have
refused
to
take
for
himself
after
this
his
habits
were
modified
all
at
once
contrary
to
his
custom
he
went
into
society
he
was
well
received
everywhere
he
met
with
great
deference
and
respect
he
seemed
to
have
found
some
end
in
life
but
everything
passed
within
the
man
there
were
no
external
signs
in
society
he
was
silent
and
cold
and
wore
a
grave
reserved
face
his
social
success
was
great
precisely
because
he
stood
out
in
such
strong
contrast
to
the
conventional
faces
which
line
the
walls
of
paris
salons
he
was
indeed
something
quite
new
there
terse
of
speech
like
a
hermit
or
a
savage
his
shyness
was
thought
to
be
haughtiness
and
people
were
greatly
taken
with
it
he
was
something
strange
and
great
women
generally
were
so
much
the
more
smitten
with
this
original
person
because
he
was
not
to
be
caught
by
their
flatteries
however
adroit
nor
by
the
wiles
with
which
they
circumvent
the
strongest
men
and
corrode
the
steel
temper
their
parisian
s
grimaces
were
lost
upon
de
montriveau
his
nature
only
responded
to
the
sonorous
vibration
of
lofty
thought
and
feeling
and
he
would
very
promptly
have
been
dropped
but
for
the
romance
that
hung
about
his
adventures
and
his
life
but
for
the
men
who
cried
him
up
behind
his
back
but
for
a
woman
who
looked
for
a
triumph
for
her
vanity
the
woman
who
was
to
fill
his
thoughts
for
these
reasons
the
duchesse
de
langeais
curiosity
was
no
less
lively
than
natural
chance
had
so
ordered
it
that
her
interest
in
the
man
before
her
had
been
aroused
only
the
day
before
when
she
heard
the
story
of
one
of
de
montriveau
s
adventures
a
story
calculated
to
make
the
strongest
impression
upon
a
woman
s
fancy
during
de
montriveau
s
voyage
of
discovery
to
the
sources
of
the
nile
he
had
had
an
argument
with
one
of
his
guides
surely
the
most
extraordinary
debate
in
the
annals
of
travel
the
district
that
he
wished
to
explore
could
only
be
reached
on
foot
across
a
tract
of
desert
only
one
of
his
guides
knew
the
way
no
traveller
had
penetrated
before
into
that
part
of
the
country
where
the
undaunted
officer
hoped
to
find
a
solution
of
several
scientific
problems
in
spite
of
the
representations
made
to
him
by
the
guide
and
the
older
men
of
the
place
he
started
upon
the
formidable
journey
summoning
up
courage
already
highly
strung
by
the
prospect
of
dreadful
difficulties
he
set
out
in
the
morning
the
loose
sand
shifted
under
his
feet
at
every
step
and
when
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
s
march
he
lay
down
to
sleep
on
the
ground
he
had
never
been
so
tired
in
his
life
he
knew
however
that
he
must
be
up
and
on
his
way
before
dawn
next
day
and
his
guide
assured
him
that
they
should
reach
the
end
of
their
journey
towards
noon
that
promise
kept
up
his
courage
and
gave
him
new
strength
in
spite
of
his
sufferings
he
continued
his
march
with
some
blasphemings
against
science
he
was
ashamed
to
complain
to
his
guide
and
kept
his
pain
to
himself
after
marching
for
a
third
of
the
day
he
felt
his
strength
failing
his
feet
were
bleeding
he
asked
if
they
should
reach
the
place
soon
in
an
hour
s
time
said
the
guide
armand
braced
himself
for
another
hour
s
march
and
they
went
on
the
hour
slipped
by
he
could
not
so
much
as
see
against
the
sky
the
and
crests
of
hill
that
should
tell
of
the
end
of
the
journey
near
at
hand
the
horizon
line
of
sand
was
vast
as
the
circle
of
the
open
sea
he
came
to
a
stand
refused
to
go
farther
and
threatened
the
guide
he
had
deceived
him
murdered
him
tears
of
rage
and
weariness
flowed
over
his
fevered
cheeks
he
was
bowed
down
with
fatigue
upon
fatigue
his
throat
seemed
to
be
glued
by
the
desert
thirst
the
guide
meanwhile
stood
motionless
listening
to
these
complaints
with
an
ironical
expression
studying
the
while
with
the
apparent
indifference
of
an
oriental
the
scarcely
perceptible
indications
in
the
lie
of
the
sands
which
looked
almost
black
like
burnished
gold
i
have
made
a
mistake
he
remarked
coolly
i
could
not
make
out
the
track
it
is
so
long
since
i
came
this
way
we
are
surely
on
it
now
but
we
must
push
on
for
two
the
man
is
right
thought
de
montriveau
so
he
went
on
again
struggling
to
follow
the
pitiless
native
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
bound
to
his
guide
by
some
thread
like
the
invisible
tie
between
the
condemned
man
and
the
headsman
but
the
two
hours
went
by
montriveau
had
spent
his
last
drops
of
energy
and
the
skyline
was
a
blank
there
were
no
no
hills
he
could
neither
cry
out
nor
groan
he
lay
down
on
the
sand
to
die
but
his
eyes
would
have
frightened
the
boldest
something
in
his
face
seemed
to
say
that
he
would
not
die
alone
his
guide
like
a
very
fiend
gave
him
back
a
cool
glance
like
a
man
that
knows
his
power
left
him
to
lie
there
and
kept
at
a
safe
distance
out
of
reach
of
his
desperate
victim
at
last
montriveau
recovered
strength
enough
for
a
last
curse
the
guide
came
nearer
silenced
him
with
a
steady
look
and
said
was
it
not
your
own
will
to
go
where
i
am
taking
you
in
spite
of
us
all
you
say
that
i
have
lied
to
you
if
i
had
not
you
would
not
be
even
here
do
you
want
the
truth
here
it
is
have
still
another
five
hours
march
before
us
and
we
can
not
go
sound
yourself
if
you
have
not
courage
enough
here
is
my
startled
by
this
dreadful
knowledge
of
pain
and
human
strength
de
montriveau
would
not
be
behind
a
savage
he
drew
a
fresh
stock
of
courage
from
his
pride
as
a
european
rose
to
his
feet
and
followed
his
guide
the
five
hours
were
at
an
end
and
still
de
montriveau
saw
nothing
he
turned
his
failing
eyes
upon
his
guide
but
the
nubian
hoisted
him
on
his
shoulders
and
showed
him
a
wide
pool
of
water
with
greenness
all
about
it
and
a
noble
forest
lighted
up
by
the
sunset
it
lay
only
a
hundred
paces
away
a
vast
ledge
of
granite
hid
the
glorious
landscape
it
seemed
to
armand
that
he
had
taken
a
new
lease
of
life
his
guide
that
giant
in
courage
and
intelligence
finished
his
work
of
devotion
by
carrying
him
across
the
hot
slippery
scarcely
discernible
track
on
the
granite
behind
him
lay
the
hell
of
burning
sand
before
him
the
earthly
paradise
of
the
most
beautiful
oasis
in
the
desert
the
duchess
struck
from
the
first
by
the
appearance
of
this
romantic
figure
was
even
more
impressed
when
she
learned
that
this
was
that
marquis
de
montriveau
of
whom
she
had
dreamed
during
the
night
she
had
been
with
him
among
the
hot
desert
sands
he
had
been
the
companion
of
her
nightmare
wanderings
for
such
a
woman
was
not
this
a
delightful
presage
of
a
new
interest
in
her
life
and
never
was
a
man
s
exterior
a
better
exponent
of
his
character
never
were
curious
glances
so
well
justified
the
principal
characteristic
of
his
great
head
was
the
thick
luxuriant
black
hair
which
framed
his
face
and
gave
him
a
strikingly
close
resemblance
to
general
kleber
and
the
likeness
still
held
good
in
the
vigorous
forehead
in
the
outlines
of
his
face
the
quiet
fearlessness
of
his
eyes
and
a
kind
of
fiery
vehemence
expressed
by
strongly
marked
features
he
was
short
and
muscular
as
a
lion
there
was
something
of
the
despot
about
him
and
an
indescribable
suggestion
of
the
security
of
strength
in
his
gait
bearing
and
slightest
movements
he
seemed
to
know
that
his
will
was
irresistible
perhaps
because
he
wished
for
nothing
unjust
and
yet
like
all
really
strong
men
he
was
mild
of
speech
simple
in
his
manners
and
kindly
natured
although
it
seemed
as
if
in
the
stress
of
a
great
crisis
all
these
finer
qualities
must
disappear
and
the
man
would
show
himself
implacable
unshaken
in
his
resolve
terrific
in
action
there
was
a
certain
drawing
in
of
the
inner
line
of
the
lips
which
to
a
close
observer
indicated
an
ironical
bent
the
duchesse
de
langeais
realising
that
a
fleeting
glory
was
to
be
won
by
such
a
conquest
made
up
her
mind
to
gain
a
lover
in
armand
de
montriveau
during
the
brief
interval
before
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
brought
him
to
be
introduced
she
would
prefer
him
above
the
others
she
would
attach
him
to
herself
display
all
her
powers
of
coquetry
for
him
it
was
a
fancy
such
a
merest
duchess
s
whim
as
furnished
a
lope
or
a
calderon
with
the
plot
of
the
in
the
she
would
not
suffer
another
woman
to
engross
him
but
she
had
not
the
remotest
intention
of
being
his
nature
had
given
the
duchess
every
qualification
for
the
part
of
coquette
and
education
had
perfected
her
women
envied
her
and
men
fell
in
love
with
her
not
without
reason
nothing
that
can
inspire
love
justify
it
and
give
it
lasting
empire
was
wanting
in
her
her
style
of
beauty
her
manner
her
voice
her
bearing
all
combined
to
give
her
that
instinctive
coquetry
which
seems
to
be
the
consciousness
of
power
her
shape
was
graceful
perhaps
there
was
a
trace
of
in
her
changes
of
movement
the
one
affectation
that
could
be
laid
to
her
charge
but
everything
about
her
was
a
part
of
her
personality
from
her
least
little
gesture
to
the
peculiar
turn
of
her
phrases
the
demure
glance
of
her
eyes
her
great
lady
s
grace
her
most
striking
characteristic
had
not
destroyed
the
very
french
quick
mobility
of
her
person
there
was
an
extraordinary
fascination
in
her
swift
incessant
changes
of
attitude
she
seemed
as
if
she
surely
would
be
a
most
delicious
mistress
when
her
corset
and
the
encumbering
costume
of
her
part
were
laid
aside
all
the
rapture
of
love
surely
was
latent
in
the
freedom
of
her
expressive
glances
in
her
caressing
tones
in
the
charm
of
her
words
she
gave
glimpses
of
the
courtesan
within
her
vainly
protesting
against
the
creeds
of
the
duchess
you
might
sit
near
her
through
an
evening
she
would
be
gay
and
melancholy
in
turn
and
her
gaiety
like
her
sadness
seemed
spontaneous
she
could
be
gracious
disdainful
insolent
or
confiding
at
will
her
apparent
good
nature
was
real
she
had
no
temptation
to
descend
to
malignity
but
at
each
moment
her
mood
changed
she
was
full
of
confidence
or
craft
her
moving
tenderness
would
give
place
to
a
hardness
and
insensibility
yet
how
paint
her
as
she
was
without
bringing
together
all
the
extremes
of
feminine
nature
in
a
word
the
duchess
was
anything
that
she
wished
to
be
or
to
seem
her
face
was
slightly
too
long
there
was
a
grace
in
it
and
a
certain
thinness
and
fineness
that
recalled
the
portraits
of
the
middle
ages
her
skin
was
white
with
a
faint
rose
tint
everything
about
her
erred
as
it
were
by
an
excess
of
delicacy
de
montriveau
willingly
consented
to
be
introduced
to
the
duchesse
de
langeais
and
she
after
the
manner
of
persons
whose
sensitive
taste
leads
them
to
avoid
banalities
refrained
from
overwhelming
him
with
questions
and
compliments
she
received
him
with
a
gracious
deference
which
could
not
fail
to
flatter
a
man
of
more
than
ordinary
powers
for
the
fact
that
a
man
rises
above
the
ordinary
level
implies
that
he
possesses
something
of
that
tact
which
makes
women
quick
to
read
feeling
if
the
duchess
showed
any
curiosity
it
was
by
her
glances
her
compliments
were
conveyed
in
her
manner
there
was
a
winning
grace
displayed
in
her
words
a
subtle
suggestion
of
a
desire
to
please
which
she
of
all
women
knew
the
art
of
manifesting
yet
her
whole
conversation
was
but
in
a
manner
the
body
of
the
letter
the
postscript
with
the
principal
thought
in
it
was
still
to
come
after
half
an
hour
spent
in
ordinary
talk
in
which
the
words
gained
all
their
value
from
her
tone
and
smiles
de
montriveau
was
about
to
retire
discreetly
when
the
duchess
stopped
him
with
an
expressive
gesture
i
do
not
know
monsieur
whether
these
few
minutes
during
which
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
talking
to
you
proved
so
sufficiently
attractive
that
i
may
venture
to
ask
you
to
call
upon
me
i
am
afraid
that
it
may
be
very
selfish
of
me
to
wish
to
have
you
all
to
myself
if
i
should
be
so
fortunate
as
to
find
that
my
house
is
agreeable
to
you
you
will
always
find
me
at
home
in
the
evening
until
ten
o
the
invitation
was
given
with
such
irresistible
grace
that
de
montriveau
could
not
refuse
to
accept
it
when
he
fell
back
again
among
the
groups
of
men
gathered
at
a
distance
from
the
women
his
friends
congratulated
him
half
laughingly
half
in
earnest
on
the
extraordinary
reception
vouchsafed
him
by
the
duchesse
de
langeais
the
difficult
and
brilliant
conquest
had
been
made
beyond
a
doubt
and
the
glory
of
it
was
reserved
for
the
artillery
of
the
guard
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
jests
good
and
bad
when
this
topic
had
once
been
started
the
world
of
paris
salons
is
so
eager
for
amusement
and
a
joke
lasts
for
such
a
short
time
that
everyone
is
eager
to
make
the
most
of
it
while
it
is
fresh
all
unconsciously
the
general
felt
flattered
by
this
nonsense
from
his
place
where
he
had
taken
his
stand
his
eyes
were
drawn
again
and
again
to
the
duchess
by
countless
wavering
reflections
he
could
not
help
admitting
to
himself
that
of
all
the
women
whose
beauty
had
captivated
his
eyes
not
one
had
seemed
to
be
a
more
exquisite
embodiment
of
faults
and
fair
qualities
blended
in
a
completeness
that
might
realise
the
dreams
of
earliest
manhood
is
there
a
man
in
any
rank
of
life
that
has
not
felt
indefinable
rapture
in
his
secret
soul
over
the
woman
singled
out
if
only
in
his
dreams
to
be
his
own
when
she
in
body
soul
and
social
aspects
satisfies
his
every
requirement
a
thrice
perfect
woman
and
if
this
threefold
perfection
that
flatters
his
pride
is
no
argument
for
loving
her
it
is
beyond
cavil
one
of
the
great
inducements
to
the
sentiment
love
would
soon
be
convalescent
as
the
eighteenth
century
moralist
remarked
were
it
not
for
vanity
and
it
is
certainly
true
that
for
everyone
man
or
woman
there
is
a
wealth
of
pleasure
in
the
superiority
of
the
beloved
is
she
set
so
high
by
birth
that
a
contemptuous
glance
can
never
wound
her
is
she
wealthy
enough
to
surround
herself
with
state
which
falls
nothing
short
of
royalty
of
kings
of
finance
during
their
short
reign
of
splendour
is
she
so
that
a
jest
never
brings
her
into
confusion
beautiful
enough
to
rival
any
woman
is
it
such
a
small
thing
to
know
that
your
will
never
suffer
through
her
a
man
makes
these
reflections
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
how
if
in
the
future
opened
out
by
early
ripened
passion
he
catches
glimpses
of
the
changeful
delight
of
her
charm
the
frank
innocence
of
a
maiden
soul
the
perils
of
love
s
voyage
the
thousand
folds
of
the
veil
of
coquetry
is
not
this
enough
to
move
the
coldest
man
s
heart
this
therefore
was
de
montriveau
s
position
with
regard
to
woman
his
past
life
in
some
measure
explaining
the
extraordinary
fact
he
had
been
thrown
when
little
more
than
a
boy
into
the
hurricane
of
napoleon
s
wars
his
life
had
been
spent
on
fields
of
battle
of
women
he
knew
just
so
much
as
a
traveller
knows
of
a
country
when
he
travels
across
it
in
haste
from
one
inn
to
another
the
verdict
which
voltaire
passed
upon
his
eighty
years
of
life
might
perhaps
have
been
applied
by
montriveau
to
his
own
years
of
existence
had
he
not
follies
with
which
to
reproach
himself
at
his
age
he
was
as
much
a
novice
in
love
as
the
lad
that
has
just
been
furtively
reading
of
women
he
had
nothing
to
learn
of
love
he
knew
nothing
and
thus
desires
quite
unknown
before
sprang
from
this
virginity
of
feeling
there
are
men
here
and
there
as
much
engrossed
in
the
work
demanded
of
them
by
poverty
or
ambition
art
or
science
as
de
montriveau
by
war
and
a
life
of
adventure
these
know
what
it
is
to
be
in
this
unusual
position
if
they
very
seldom
confess
to
it
every
man
in
paris
is
supposed
to
have
been
in
love
no
woman
in
paris
cares
to
take
what
other
women
have
passed
over
the
dread
of
being
taken
for
a
fool
is
the
source
of
the
coxcomb
s
bragging
so
common
in
france
for
in
france
to
have
the
reputation
of
a
fool
is
to
be
a
foreigner
in
one
s
own
country
vehement
desire
seized
on
de
montriveau
desire
that
had
gathered
strength
from
the
heat
of
the
desert
and
the
first
stirrings
of
a
heart
unknown
as
yet
in
its
suppressed
turbulence
a
strong
man
and
violent
as
he
was
strong
he
could
keep
mastery
over
himself
but
as
he
talked
of
indifferent
things
he
retired
within
himself
and
swore
to
possess
this
woman
for
through
that
thought
lay
the
only
way
to
love
for
him
desire
became
a
solemn
compact
made
with
himself
an
oath
after
the
manner
of
the
arabs
among
whom
he
had
lived
for
among
them
a
vow
is
a
kind
of
contract
made
with
destiny
a
man
s
whole
future
is
solemnly
pledged
to
fulfil
it
and
everything
even
his
own
death
is
regarded
simply
as
a
means
to
the
one
end
a
younger
man
would
have
said
to
himself
i
should
very
much
like
to
have
the
duchess
for
my
mistress
or
if
the
duchesse
de
langeais
cared
for
a
man
he
would
be
a
very
lucky
rascal
but
the
general
said
i
will
have
mme
de
langeais
for
my
and
if
a
man
takes
such
an
idea
into
his
head
when
his
heart
has
never
been
touched
before
and
love
begins
to
be
a
kind
of
religion
with
him
he
little
knows
in
what
a
hell
he
has
set
his
foot
armand
de
montriveau
suddenly
took
flight
and
went
home
in
the
first
hot
of
the
first
love
that
he
had
known
when
a
man
has
kept
all
his
boyish
beliefs
illusions
frankness
and
impetuosity
into
middle
age
his
first
impulse
is
as
it
were
to
stretch
out
a
hand
to
take
the
thing
that
he
desires
a
little
later
he
realizes
that
there
is
a
gulf
set
between
them
and
that
it
is
all
but
impossible
to
cross
it
a
sort
of
childish
impatience
seizes
him
he
wants
the
thing
the
more
and
trembles
or
cries
wherefore
the
next
day
after
the
stormiest
reflections
that
had
yet
perturbed
his
mind
armand
de
montriveau
discovered
that
he
was
under
the
yoke
of
the
senses
and
his
bondage
made
the
heavier
by
his
love
the
woman
so
cavalierly
treated
in
his
thoughts
of
yesterday
had
become
a
most
sacred
and
dreadful
power
she
was
to
be
his
world
his
life
from
this
time
forth
the
greatest
joy
the
keenest
anguish
that
he
had
yet
known
grew
colorless
before
the
bare
recollection
of
the
least
sensation
stirred
in
him
by
her
the
swiftest
revolutions
in
a
man
s
outward
life
only
touch
his
interests
while
passion
brings
a
complete
revulsion
of
feeling
and
so
in
those
who
live
by
feeling
rather
than
by
the
doers
rather
than
the
reasoners
the
sanguine
rather
than
the
lymphatic
temperaments
love
works
a
complete
revolution
in
a
flash
with
one
single
reflection
armand
de
montriveau
wiped
out
his
whole
past
life
a
score
of
times
he
asked
himself
like
a
boy
shall
i
go
or
shall
i
not
and
then
at
last
he
dressed
came
to
the
hotel
de
langeais
towards
eight
o
clock
that
evening
and
was
admitted
he
was
to
see
the
woman
ah
not
the
woman
the
idol
that
he
had
seen
yesterday
among
lights
a
fresh
innocent
girl
in
gauze
and
silken
lace
and
veiling
he
burst
in
upon
her
to
declare
his
love
as
if
it
were
a
question
of
firing
the
first
shot
on
a
field
of
battle
poor
novice
he
found
his
ethereal
sylphide
shrouded
in
a
brown
cashmere
ingeniously
befrilled
lying
languidly
stretched
out
upon
a
sofa
in
a
dimly
lighted
boudoir
mme
de
langeais
did
not
so
much
as
rise
nothing
was
visible
of
her
but
her
face
her
hair
was
loose
but
confined
by
a
scarf
a
hand
indicated
a
seat
a
hand
that
seemed
white
as
marble
to
montriveau
by
the
flickering
light
of
a
single
candle
at
the
further
side
of
the
room
and
a
voice
as
soft
as
the
light
said
if
it
had
been
anyone
else
le
marquis
a
friend
with
whom
i
could
dispense
with
ceremony
or
a
mere
acquaintance
in
whom
i
felt
but
slight
interest
i
should
have
closed
my
door
i
am
exceedingly
i
will
go
armand
said
to
himself
but
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
she
continued
and
the
simple
warrior
attributed
the
shining
of
her
eyes
to
fever
perhaps
it
was
a
presentiment
of
your
kind
visit
and
no
one
can
be
more
sensible
of
the
prompt
attention
than
i
but
the
vapors
have
left
my
then
may
i
stay
oh
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
allow
you
to
go
i
told
myself
this
morning
that
it
was
impossible
that
i
should
have
made
the
slightest
impression
on
your
mind
and
that
in
all
probability
you
took
my
request
for
one
of
the
commonplaces
of
which
parisians
are
lavish
on
every
occasion
and
i
forgave
your
ingratitude
in
advance
an
explorer
from
the
deserts
is
not
supposed
to
know
how
exclusive
we
are
in
our
friendships
in
the
the
gracious
words
dropped
one
by
one
as
if
they
had
been
weighted
with
the
gladness
that
apparently
brought
them
to
her
lips
the
duchess
meant
to
have
the
full
benefit
of
her
headache
and
her
speculation
was
fully
successful
the
general
poor
man
was
really
distressed
by
the
lady
s
simulated
distress
like
crillon
listening
to
the
story
of
the
crucifixion
he
was
ready
to
draw
his
sword
against
the
vapors
how
could
a
man
dare
to
speak
just
then
to
this
suffering
woman
of
the
love
that
she
inspired
armand
had
already
felt
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
fire
off
a
declaration
of
love
at
one
so
far
above
other
women
with
a
single
thought
came
understanding
of
the
delicacies
of
feeling
of
the
soul
s
requirements
to
love
what
was
that
but
to
know
how
to
plead
to
beg
for
alms
to
wait
and
as
for
the
love
that
he
felt
must
he
not
prove
it
his
tongue
was
mute
it
was
frozen
by
the
conventions
of
the
noble
faubourg
the
majesty
of
a
sick
headache
the
bashfulness
of
love
but
no
power
on
earth
could
veil
his
glances
the
heat
and
the
infinite
of
the
desert
blazed
in
eyes
calm
as
a
panther
s
beneath
the
lids
that
fell
so
seldom
the
duchess
enjoyed
the
steady
gaze
that
enveloped
her
in
light
and
warmth
mme
la
duchesse
he
answered
i
am
afraid
i
express
my
gratitude
for
your
goodness
very
badly
at
this
moment
i
have
but
one
desire
i
wish
it
were
in
my
power
to
cure
the
permit
me
to
throw
this
off
i
feel
too
warm
now
she
said
gracefully
tossing
aside
a
cushion
that
covered
her
feet
madame
in
asia
your
feet
would
be
worth
some
ten
thousand
sequins
a
traveler
s
compliment
smiled
she
it
pleased
the
sprightly
lady
to
involve
a
rough
soldier
in
a
labyrinth
of
nonsense
commonplaces
and
meaningless
talk
in
which
he
manoeuvred
in
military
language
as
prince
charles
might
have
done
at
close
quarters
with
napoleon
she
took
a
mischievous
amusement
in
reconnoitring
the
extent
of
his
infatuation
by
the
number
of
foolish
speeches
extracted
from
a
novice
whom
she
led
step
by
step
into
a
hopeless
maze
meaning
to
leave
him
there
in
confusion
she
began
by
laughing
at
him
but
nevertheless
it
pleased
her
to
make
him
forget
how
time
went
the
length
of
a
first
visit
is
frequently
a
compliment
but
armand
was
innocent
of
any
such
intent
the
famous
explorer
spent
an
hour
in
chat
on
all
sorts
of
subjects
said
nothing
that
he
meant
to
say
and
was
feeling
that
he
was
only
an
instrument
on
whom
this
woman
played
when
she
rose
sat
upright
drew
the
scarf
from
her
hair
and
wrapped
it
about
her
throat
leant
her
elbow
on
the
cushions
did
him
the
honour
of
a
complete
cure
and
rang
for
lights
the
most
graceful
movement
succeeded
to
complete
repose
she
turned
to
de
montriveau
from
whom
she
had
just
extracted
a
confidence
which
seemed
to
interest
her
deeply
and
said
you
wish
to
make
game
of
me
by
trying
to
make
me
believe
that
you
have
never
loved
it
is
a
man
s
great
pretension
with
us
and
we
always
believe
it
out
of
pure
politeness
do
we
not
know
what
to
expect
from
it
for
ourselves
where
is
the
man
that
has
found
but
a
single
opportunity
of
losing
his
heart
but
you
love
to
deceive
us
and
we
submit
to
be
deceived
poor
foolish
creatures
that
we
are
for
your
hypocrisy
is
after
all
a
homage
paid
to
the
superiority
of
our
sentiments
which
are
all
the
last
words
were
spoken
with
a
disdainful
pride
that
made
the
novice
in
love
feel
like
a
worthless
bale
flung
into
the
deep
while
the
duchess
was
an
angel
soaring
back
to
her
particular
heaven
confound
it
thought
armand
de
montriveau
how
am
i
to
tell
this
wild
thing
that
i
love
her
he
had
told
her
already
a
score
of
times
or
rather
the
duchess
had
a
score
of
times
read
his
secret
in
his
eyes
and
the
passion
in
this
unmistakably
great
man
promised
her
amusement
and
an
interest
in
her
empty
life
so
she
prepared
with
no
little
dexterity
to
raise
a
certain
number
of
redoubts
for
him
to
carry
by
storm
before
he
should
gain
an
entrance
into
her
heart
montriveau
should
overleap
one
difficulty
after
another
he
should
be
a
plaything
for
her
caprice
just
as
an
insect
teased
by
children
is
made
to
jump
from
one
finger
to
another
and
in
spite
of
all
its
pains
is
kept
in
the
same
place
by
its
mischievous
tormentor
and
yet
it
gave
the
duchess
inexpressible
happiness
to
see
that
this
strong
man
had
told
her
the
truth
armand
had
never
loved
as
he
had
said
he
was
about
to
go
in
a
bad
humour
with
himself
and
still
more
out
of
humour
with
her
but
it
delighted
her
to
see
a
sullenness
that
she
could
conjure
away
with
a
word
a
glance
or
a
gesture
will
you
come
tomorrow
evening
she
asked
i
am
going
to
a
ball
but
i
shall
stay
at
home
for
you
until
ten
o
montriveau
spent
most
of
the
next
day
in
smoking
an
indeterminate
quantity
of
cigars
in
his
study
window
and
so
got
through
the
hours
till
he
could
dress
and
go
to
the
hotel
de
langeais
to
anyone
who
had
known
the
magnificent
worth
of
the
man
it
would
have
been
grievous
to
see
him
grown
so
small
so
distrustful
of
himself
the
mind
that
might
have
shed
light
over
undiscovered
worlds
shrunk
to
the
proportions
of
a
s
boudoir
even
he
himself
felt
that
he
had
fallen
so
low
already
in
his
happiness
that
to
save
his
life
he
could
not
have
told
his
love
to
one
of
his
closest
friends
is
there
not
always
a
trace
of
shame
in
the
lover
s
bashfulness
and
perhaps
in
woman
a
certain
exultation
over
diminished
masculine
stature
indeed
but
for
a
host
of
motives
of
this
kind
how
explain
why
women
are
nearly
always
the
first
to
betray
the
secret
a
secret
of
which
perhaps
they
soon
weary
mme
la
duchesse
can
not
see
visitors
monsieur
said
the
man
she
is
dressing
she
begs
you
to
wait
for
her
armand
walked
up
and
down
the
studying
her
taste
in
the
least
details
he
admired
mme
de
langeais
herself
in
the
objects
of
her
choosing
they
revealed
her
life
before
he
could
grasp
her
personality
and
ideas
about
an
hour
later
the
duchess
came
noiselessly
out
of
her
chamber
montriveau
turned
saw
her
flit
like
a
shadow
across
the
room
and
trembled
she
came
up
to
him
not
with
a
bourgeoise
s
enquiry
how
do
i
look
she
was
sure
of
herself
her
steady
eyes
said
plainly
i
am
adorned
to
please
no
one
surely
save
the
old
fairy
godmother
of
some
princess
in
disguise
could
have
wound
a
cloud
of
gauze
about
the
dainty
throat
so
that
the
dazzling
satin
skin
beneath
should
gleam
through
the
gleaming
folds
the
duchess
was
dazzling
the
pale
blue
colour
of
her
gown
repeated
in
the
flowers
in
her
hair
appeared
by
the
richness
of
its
hue
to
lend
substance
to
a
fragile
form
grown
too
wholly
ethereal
for
as
she
glided
towards
armand
the
loose
ends
of
her
scarf
floated
about
her
putting
that
valiant
warrior
in
mind
of
the
bright
damosel
flies
that
hover
now
over
water
now
over
the
flowers
with
which
they
seem
to
mingle
and
blend
i
have
kept
you
waiting
she
said
with
the
tone
that
a
woman
can
always
bring
into
her
voice
for
the
man
whom
she
wishes
to
please
i
would
wait
patiently
through
an
eternity
said
he
if
i
were
sure
of
finding
a
divinity
so
fair
but
it
is
no
compliment
to
speak
of
your
beauty
to
you
nothing
save
worship
could
touch
you
suffer
me
only
to
kiss
your
oh
fie
she
said
with
a
commanding
gesture
i
esteem
you
enough
to
give
you
my
she
held
it
out
for
his
kiss
a
woman
s
hand
still
moist
from
the
scented
bath
has
a
soft
freshness
a
velvet
smoothness
that
sends
a
tingling
thrill
from
the
lips
to
the
soul
and
if
a
man
is
attracted
to
a
woman
and
his
senses
are
as
quick
to
feel
pleasure
as
his
heart
is
full
of
love
such
a
kiss
though
chaste
in
appearance
may
conjure
up
a
terrific
storm
will
you
always
give
it
me
like
this
the
general
asked
humbly
when
he
had
pressed
that
dangerous
hand
respectfully
to
his
lips
yes
but
there
we
must
stop
she
said
smiling
she
sat
down
and
seemed
very
slow
over
putting
on
her
gloves
trying
to
slip
the
unstretched
kid
over
all
her
fingers
at
once
while
she
watched
de
montriveau
and
he
was
lost
in
admiration
of
the
duchess
and
those
repeated
graceful
movements
of
hers
ah
you
were
punctual
she
said
that
is
right
i
like
punctuality
it
is
the
courtesy
of
kings
his
majesty
says
but
to
my
thinking
from
you
men
it
is
the
most
respectful
flattery
of
all
now
is
it
not
just
tell
again
she
gave
him
a
side
glance
to
express
her
insidious
friendship
for
he
was
dumb
with
happiness
sheer
happiness
through
such
nothings
as
these
oh
the
duchess
understood
metier
de
the
art
and
mystery
of
being
a
woman
most
marvelously
well
she
knew
to
admiration
how
to
raise
a
man
in
his
own
esteem
as
he
humbled
himself
to
her
how
to
reward
every
step
of
the
descent
to
sentimental
folly
with
hollow
flatteries
you
will
never
forget
to
come
at
nine
o
no
but
are
you
going
to
a
ball
every
night
do
i
know
she
answered
with
a
little
childlike
shrug
of
the
shoulders
the
gesture
was
meant
to
say
that
she
was
nothing
if
not
capricious
and
that
a
lover
must
take
her
as
she
besides
she
added
what
is
that
to
you
you
shall
be
my
that
would
be
difficult
tonight
he
objected
i
am
not
properly
it
seems
to
me
she
returned
loftily
that
if
anyone
has
a
right
to
complain
of
your
costume
it
is
i
know
therefore
le
that
if
i
accept
a
man
s
arm
he
is
forthwith
above
the
laws
of
fashion
nobody
would
venture
to
criticise
him
you
do
not
know
the
world
i
see
i
like
you
the
better
for
and
even
as
she
spoke
she
swept
him
into
the
pettiness
of
that
world
by
the
attempt
to
initiate
him
into
the
vanities
of
a
woman
of
fashion
if
she
chooses
to
do
a
foolish
thing
for
me
i
should
be
a
simpleton
to
prevent
her
said
armand
to
himself
she
has
a
liking
for
me
beyond
a
doubt
and
as
for
the
world
she
can
not
despise
it
more
than
i
do
so
now
for
the
ball
if
she
the
duchess
probably
thought
that
if
the
general
came
with
her
and
appeared
in
a
ballroom
in
boots
and
a
black
tie
nobody
would
hesitate
to
believe
that
he
was
violently
in
love
with
her
and
the
general
was
well
pleased
that
the
queen
of
fashion
should
think
of
compromising
herself
for
him
hope
gave
him
wit
he
had
gained
confidence
he
brought
out
his
thoughts
and
views
he
felt
nothing
of
the
restraint
that
weighed
on
his
spirits
yesterday
his
talk
was
interesting
and
animated
and
full
of
those
first
confidences
so
sweet
to
make
and
to
receive
was
mme
de
langeais
really
carried
away
by
his
talk
or
had
she
devised
this
charming
piece
of
coquetry
at
any
rate
she
looked
up
mischievously
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
ah
you
have
made
me
too
late
for
the
ball
she
exclaimed
surprised
and
vexed
that
she
had
forgotten
how
time
was
going
the
next
moment
she
approved
the
exchange
of
pleasures
with
a
smile
that
made
armand
s
heart
give
a
sudden
leap
i
certainly
promised
mme
de
beauseant
she
added
they
are
all
expecting
very
well
no
go
on
i
will
stay
your
eastern
adventures
fascinate
me
tell
me
the
whole
story
of
your
life
i
love
to
share
in
a
brave
man
s
hardships
and
i
feel
them
all
indeed
i
do
she
was
playing
with
her
scarf
twisting
it
and
pulling
it
to
pieces
with
jerky
impatient
movements
that
seemed
to
tell
of
inward
dissatisfaction
and
deep
reflection
are
fit
for
nothing
she
went
on
ah
we
are
contemptible
selfish
frivolous
creatures
we
can
bore
ourselves
with
amusements
and
that
is
all
we
can
do
not
one
of
us
that
understands
that
she
has
a
part
to
play
in
life
in
old
days
in
france
women
were
beneficent
lights
they
lived
to
comfort
those
that
mourned
to
encourage
high
virtues
to
reward
artists
and
stir
new
life
with
noble
thoughts
if
the
world
has
grown
so
petty
ours
is
the
fault
you
make
me
loathe
the
ball
and
this
world
in
which
i
live
no
i
am
not
giving
up
much
for
she
had
plucked
her
scarf
to
pieces
as
a
child
plays
with
a
flower
pulling
away
all
the
petals
one
by
one
and
now
she
crushed
it
into
a
ball
and
flung
it
away
she
could
show
her
swan
s
neck
she
rang
the
bell
i
shall
not
go
out
tonight
she
told
the
footman
her
long
blue
eyes
turned
timidly
to
armand
and
by
the
look
of
misgiving
in
them
he
knew
that
he
was
meant
to
take
the
order
for
a
confession
for
a
first
and
great
favour
there
was
a
pause
filled
with
many
thoughts
before
she
spoke
with
that
tenderness
which
is
often
in
women
s
voices
and
not
so
often
in
their
hearts
you
have
had
a
hard
life
she
said
no
returned
armand
until
today
i
did
not
know
what
happiness
then
you
know
it
now
she
asked
looking
at
him
with
a
demure
keen
glance
what
is
happiness
for
me
henceforth
but
this
to
see
you
to
hear
you
until
now
i
have
only
known
privation
now
i
know
that
i
can
be
unhappy
that
will
do
that
will
do
she
said
you
must
go
it
is
past
midnight
let
us
regard
appearances
people
must
not
talk
about
us
i
do
not
know
quite
what
i
shall
say
but
the
headache
is
a
friend
and
tells
no
is
there
to
be
a
ball
tomorrow
night
you
would
grow
accustomed
to
the
life
i
think
very
well
yes
we
will
go
again
tomorrow
there
was
not
a
happier
man
in
the
world
than
armand
when
he
went
out
from
her
every
evening
he
came
to
mme
de
langeais
at
the
hour
kept
for
him
by
a
tacit
understanding
it
would
be
tedious
and
for
the
many
young
men
who
carry
a
redundance
of
such
sweet
memories
in
their
hearts
it
were
superfluous
to
follow
the
story
step
by
step
the
progress
of
a
romance
growing
in
those
hours
spent
together
a
romance
controlled
entirely
by
a
woman
s
will
if
sentiment
went
too
fast
she
would
raise
a
quarrel
over
a
word
or
when
words
flagged
behind
her
thoughts
she
appealed
to
the
feelings
perhaps
the
only
way
of
following
such
penelope
s
progress
is
by
marking
its
outward
and
visible
signs
as
for
instance
within
a
few
days
of
their
first
meeting
the
assiduous
general
had
won
and
kept
the
right
to
kiss
his
lady
s
insatiable
hands
wherever
mme
de
langeais
went
de
montriveau
was
certain
to
be
seen
till
people
jokingly
called
him
her
grace
s
and
already
he
had
made
enemies
others
were
jealous
and
envied
him
his
position
mme
de
langeais
had
attained
her
end
the
marquis
de
montriveau
was
among
her
numerous
train
of
adorers
and
a
means
of
humiliating
those
who
boasted
of
their
progress
in
her
good
graces
for
she
publicly
gave
him
preference
over
them
all
decidedly
de
montriveau
is
the
man
for
whom
the
duchess
shows
a
preference
pronounced
mme
de
serizy
and
who
in
paris
does
not
know
what
it
means
when
a
woman
shows
a
preference
all
went
on
therefore
according
to
prescribed
rule
the
anecdotes
which
people
were
pleased
to
circulate
concerning
the
general
put
that
warrior
in
so
formidable
a
light
that
the
more
adroit
quietly
dropped
their
pretensions
to
the
duchess
and
remained
in
her
train
merely
to
turn
the
position
to
account
and
to
use
her
name
and
personality
to
make
better
terms
for
themselves
with
certain
stars
of
the
second
magnitude
and
those
lesser
powers
were
delighted
to
take
a
lover
away
from
mme
de
langeais
the
duchess
was
enough
to
see
these
desertions
and
treaties
with
the
enemy
and
her
pride
would
not
suffer
her
to
be
the
dupe
of
them
as
de
talleyrand
one
of
her
great
admirers
said
she
knew
how
to
take
a
second
edition
of
revenge
laying
the
blade
of
a
sarcasm
between
the
pairs
in
these
morganatic
unions
her
mocking
disdain
contributed
not
a
little
to
increase
her
reputation
as
an
extremely
clever
woman
and
a
person
to
be
feared
her
character
for
virtue
was
consolidated
while
she
amused
herself
with
other
people
s
secrets
and
kept
her
own
to
herself
yet
after
two
months
of
assiduities
she
saw
with
a
vague
dread
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
that
de
montriveau
understood
nothing
of
the
subtleties
of
flirtation
after
the
manner
of
the
faubourg
he
was
taking
a
parisienne
s
coquetry
in
earnest
you
will
not
tame
dear
duchess
the
old
vidame
de
pamiers
had
said
tis
a
first
cousin
to
the
eagle
he
will
carry
you
off
to
his
eyrie
if
you
do
not
take
then
mme
de
langeais
felt
afraid
the
shrewd
old
noble
s
words
sounded
like
a
prophecy
the
next
day
she
tried
to
turn
love
to
hate
she
was
harsh
exacting
irritable
unbearable
montriveau
disarmed
her
with
angelic
sweetness
she
so
little
knew
the
great
generosity
of
a
large
nature
that
the
kindly
jests
with
which
her
first
complaints
were
met
went
to
her
heart
she
sought
a
quarrel
and
found
proofs
of
affection
she
persisted
when
a
man
idolizes
you
how
can
he
have
vexed
you
asked
armand
you
do
not
vex
me
she
answered
suddenly
grown
gentle
and
submissive
but
why
do
you
wish
to
compromise
me
for
me
you
ought
to
be
nothing
but
a
do
you
not
know
it
i
wish
i
could
see
that
you
had
the
instincts
the
delicacy
of
real
friendship
so
that
i
might
lose
neither
your
respect
nor
the
pleasure
that
your
presence
gives
nothing
but
your
he
cried
out
the
terrible
word
sent
an
electric
shock
through
his
brain
on
the
faith
of
these
happy
hours
that
you
grant
me
i
sleep
and
wake
in
your
heart
and
now
today
for
no
reason
you
are
pleased
to
destroy
all
the
secret
hopes
by
which
i
live
you
have
required
promises
of
such
constancy
in
me
you
have
said
so
much
of
your
horror
of
women
made
up
of
nothing
but
caprice
and
now
do
you
wish
me
to
understand
that
like
other
women
here
in
paris
you
have
passions
and
know
nothing
of
love
if
so
why
did
you
ask
my
life
of
me
why
did
you
accept
it
i
was
wrong
my
friend
oh
it
is
wrong
of
a
woman
to
yield
to
such
intoxication
when
she
must
not
and
can
not
make
any
i
understand
you
have
merely
been
coquetting
with
me
and
coquetting
she
repeated
i
detest
coquetry
a
coquette
armand
makes
promises
to
many
and
gives
herself
to
none
and
a
woman
who
keeps
such
promises
is
a
libertine
this
much
i
believed
i
had
grasped
of
our
code
but
to
be
melancholy
with
humorists
gay
with
the
frivolous
and
politic
with
ambitious
souls
to
listen
to
a
babbler
with
every
appearance
of
admiration
to
talk
of
war
with
a
soldier
wax
enthusiastic
with
philanthropists
over
the
good
of
the
nation
and
to
give
to
each
one
his
little
dole
of
flattery
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
as
much
a
matter
of
necessity
as
dress
diamonds
and
gloves
or
flowers
in
one
s
hair
such
talk
is
the
moral
counterpart
of
the
toilette
you
take
it
up
and
lay
it
aside
with
the
plumed
do
you
call
this
coquetry
why
i
have
never
treated
you
as
i
treat
everyone
else
with
you
my
friend
i
am
sincere
have
i
not
always
shared
your
views
and
when
you
convinced
me
after
a
discussion
was
i
not
always
perfectly
glad
in
short
i
love
you
but
only
as
a
devout
and
pure
woman
may
love
i
have
thought
it
over
i
am
a
married
woman
armand
my
way
of
life
with
de
langeais
gives
me
liberty
to
bestow
my
heart
but
law
and
custom
leave
me
no
right
to
dispose
of
my
person
if
a
woman
loses
her
honour
she
is
an
outcast
in
any
rank
of
life
and
i
have
yet
to
meet
with
a
single
example
of
a
man
that
realizes
all
that
our
sacrifices
demand
of
him
in
such
a
case
quite
otherwise
anyone
can
foresee
the
rupture
between
mme
de
beauseant
and
d
ajuda
for
he
is
going
to
marry
mlle
de
rochefide
it
seems
that
affair
made
it
clear
to
my
mind
that
these
very
sacrifices
on
the
woman
s
part
are
almost
always
the
cause
of
the
man
s
desertion
if
you
had
loved
me
sincerely
you
would
have
kept
away
for
a
now
i
will
lay
aside
all
vanity
for
you
is
not
that
something
what
will
not
people
say
of
a
woman
to
whom
no
man
attaches
himself
oh
she
is
heartless
brainless
soulless
and
what
is
more
devoid
of
charm
coquettes
will
not
spare
me
they
will
rob
me
of
the
very
qualities
that
mortify
them
so
long
as
my
reputation
is
safe
what
do
i
care
if
my
rivals
deny
my
merits
they
certainly
will
not
inherit
them
come
my
friend
give
up
something
for
her
who
sacrifices
so
much
for
you
do
not
come
quite
so
often
i
shall
love
you
none
the
ah
said
armand
with
the
profound
irony
of
a
wounded
heart
in
his
words
and
tone
love
so
the
scribblers
say
only
feeds
on
illusions
nothing
could
be
truer
i
see
i
am
expected
to
imagine
that
i
am
loved
but
there
there
are
some
thoughts
like
wounds
from
which
there
is
no
recovery
my
belief
in
you
was
one
of
the
last
left
to
me
and
now
i
see
that
there
is
nothing
left
to
believe
in
this
she
began
to
smile
yes
montriveau
went
on
in
an
unsteady
voice
this
catholic
faith
to
which
you
wish
to
convert
me
is
a
lie
that
men
make
for
themselves
hope
is
a
lie
at
the
expense
of
the
future
pride
a
lie
between
us
and
our
fellows
and
pity
and
prudence
and
terror
are
cunning
lies
and
now
my
happiness
is
to
be
one
more
lying
delusion
i
am
expected
to
delude
myself
to
be
willing
to
give
gold
coin
for
silver
to
the
end
if
you
can
so
easily
dispense
with
my
visits
if
you
can
confess
me
neither
as
your
friend
nor
your
lover
you
do
not
care
for
me
and
i
poor
fool
that
i
am
tell
myself
this
and
know
it
and
love
you
but
dear
me
poor
armand
you
are
flying
into
a
passion
i
flying
into
a
passion
yes
you
think
that
the
whole
question
is
opened
because
i
ask
you
to
be
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
was
delighted
with
the
anger
that
leapt
out
in
her
lover
s
eyes
even
as
she
tortured
him
she
was
criticising
him
watching
every
slightest
change
that
passed
over
his
face
if
the
general
had
been
so
unluckily
inspired
as
to
show
himself
generous
without
discussion
as
happens
occasionally
with
some
artless
souls
he
would
have
been
a
banished
man
forever
accused
and
convicted
of
not
knowing
how
to
love
most
women
are
not
displeased
to
have
their
code
of
right
and
wrong
broken
through
do
they
not
flatter
themselves
that
they
never
yield
except
to
force
but
armand
was
not
learned
enough
in
this
kind
of
lore
to
see
the
snare
ingeniously
spread
for
him
by
the
duchess
so
much
of
the
child
was
there
in
the
strong
man
in
love
if
all
you
want
is
to
preserve
appearances
he
began
in
his
simplicity
i
am
willing
to
simply
to
preserve
appearances
the
lady
broke
in
why
what
idea
can
you
have
of
me
have
i
given
you
the
slightest
reason
to
suppose
that
i
can
be
yours
why
what
else
are
we
talking
about
demanded
montriveau
monsieur
you
frighten
me
no
pardon
me
thank
you
she
added
coldly
thank
you
armand
you
have
given
me
timely
warning
of
imprudence
committed
quite
unconsciously
believe
it
my
friend
you
know
how
to
endure
you
say
i
also
know
how
to
endure
we
will
not
see
each
other
for
a
time
and
then
when
both
of
us
have
contrived
to
recover
calmness
to
some
extent
we
will
think
about
arrangements
for
a
happiness
sanctioned
by
the
world
i
am
young
armand
a
man
with
no
delicacy
might
tempt
a
woman
of
to
do
many
foolish
wild
things
for
his
sake
but
you
will
be
my
friend
promise
me
that
you
will
the
woman
of
returned
he
knows
what
she
is
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
boudoir
and
leant
his
head
on
his
hands
do
you
love
me
madame
he
asked
at
length
raising
his
head
and
turning
a
face
full
of
resolution
upon
her
say
it
straight
out
yes
or
no
his
direct
question
dismayed
the
duchess
more
than
a
threat
of
suicide
could
have
done
indeed
the
woman
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
not
to
be
frightened
by
that
stale
stratagem
the
sword
has
ceased
to
be
part
of
the
masculine
costume
but
in
the
effect
of
eyelids
and
lashes
in
the
contraction
of
the
gaze
in
the
twitching
of
the
lips
is
there
not
some
influence
that
communicates
the
terror
which
they
express
with
such
vivid
magnetic
power
ah
if
i
were
free
if
oh
is
it
only
your
husband
that
stands
in
the
way
the
general
exclaimed
joyfully
as
he
strode
to
and
fro
in
the
boudoir
dear
antoinette
i
wield
a
more
absolute
power
than
the
autocrat
of
all
the
russias
i
have
a
compact
with
fate
i
can
advance
or
retard
destiny
so
far
as
men
are
concerned
at
my
fancy
as
you
alter
the
hands
of
a
watch
if
you
can
direct
the
course
of
fate
in
our
political
machinery
it
simply
means
does
it
not
that
you
understand
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
you
shall
be
free
before
very
long
and
then
you
must
remember
your
armand
she
cried
what
do
you
mean
great
heavens
can
you
imagine
that
i
am
to
be
the
prize
of
a
crime
do
you
want
to
kill
me
why
you
can
not
have
any
religion
in
you
for
my
own
part
i
fear
god
de
langeais
may
have
given
me
reason
to
hate
him
but
i
wish
him
no
manner
of
de
montriveau
beat
a
tattoo
on
the
marble
and
only
looked
composedly
at
the
lady
dear
continued
she
respect
him
he
does
not
love
me
he
is
not
kind
to
me
but
i
have
duties
to
fulfil
with
regard
to
him
what
would
i
not
do
to
avert
the
calamities
with
which
you
threaten
him
listen
she
continued
after
a
pause
i
will
not
say
another
word
about
separation
you
shall
come
here
as
in
the
past
and
i
will
still
give
you
my
forehead
to
kiss
if
i
refused
once
or
twice
it
was
pure
coquetry
indeed
it
was
but
let
us
understand
each
other
she
added
as
he
came
closer
you
will
permit
me
to
add
to
the
number
of
my
satellites
to
receive
even
more
visitors
in
the
morning
than
heretofore
i
mean
to
be
twice
as
frivolous
i
mean
to
use
you
to
all
appearance
very
badly
to
feign
a
rupture
you
must
come
not
quite
so
often
and
then
afterwards
while
she
spoke
she
had
allowed
him
to
put
an
arm
about
her
waist
montriveau
was
holding
her
tightly
to
him
and
she
seemed
to
feel
the
exceeding
pleasure
that
women
usually
feel
in
that
close
contact
an
earnest
of
the
bliss
of
a
closer
union
and
then
doubtless
she
meant
to
elicit
some
confidence
for
she
raised
herself
on
tiptoe
and
laid
her
forehead
against
armand
s
burning
lips
and
then
montriveau
finished
her
sentence
for
her
you
shall
not
speak
to
me
of
your
husband
you
ought
not
to
think
of
him
mme
de
langeais
was
silent
awhile
at
least
she
said
after
a
significant
pause
at
least
you
will
do
all
that
i
wish
without
grumbling
you
will
not
be
naughty
tell
me
so
my
friend
you
wanted
to
frighten
me
did
you
not
come
now
confess
it
you
are
too
good
ever
to
think
of
crimes
but
is
it
possible
that
you
can
have
secrets
that
i
do
not
know
how
can
you
control
fate
now
when
you
confirm
the
gift
of
the
heart
that
you
have
already
given
me
i
am
far
too
happy
to
know
exactly
how
to
answer
you
i
can
trust
you
antoinette
i
shall
have
no
suspicion
no
unfounded
jealousy
of
you
but
if
accident
should
set
you
free
we
shall
be
one
accident
armand
with
that
little
dainty
turn
of
the
head
that
seems
to
say
so
many
things
a
gesture
that
such
women
as
the
duchess
can
use
on
light
occasions
as
a
great
singer
can
act
with
her
voice
pure
accident
she
repeated
mind
that
if
anything
should
happen
to
de
langeais
by
your
fault
i
should
never
be
and
so
they
parted
mutually
content
the
duchess
had
made
a
pact
that
left
her
free
to
prove
to
the
world
by
words
and
deeds
that
de
montriveau
was
no
lover
of
hers
and
as
for
him
the
wily
duchess
vowed
to
tire
him
out
he
should
have
nothing
of
her
beyond
the
little
concessions
snatched
in
the
course
of
contests
that
she
could
stop
at
her
pleasure
she
had
so
pretty
an
art
of
revoking
the
grant
of
yesterday
she
was
so
much
in
earnest
in
her
purpose
to
remain
technically
virtuous
that
she
felt
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
danger
for
her
in
preliminaries
fraught
with
peril
for
a
woman
less
sure
of
her
after
all
the
duchess
was
practically
separated
from
her
husband
a
marriage
long
since
annulled
was
no
great
sacrifice
to
make
to
her
love
montriveau
on
his
side
was
quite
happy
to
win
the
vaguest
promise
glad
once
for
all
to
sweep
aside
with
all
scruples
of
conjugal
fidelity
her
stock
of
excuses
for
refusing
herself
to
his
love
he
had
gained
ground
a
little
and
congratulated
himself
and
so
for
a
time
he
took
unfair
advantage
of
the
rights
so
hardly
won
more
a
boy
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
he
gave
himself
up
to
all
the
childishness
that
makes
first
love
the
flower
of
life
he
was
a
child
again
as
he
poured
out
all
his
soul
all
the
thwarted
forces
that
passion
had
given
him
upon
her
hands
upon
the
dazzling
forehead
that
looked
so
pure
to
his
eyes
upon
her
fair
hair
on
the
tufted
curls
where
his
lips
were
pressed
and
the
duchess
on
whom
his
love
was
poured
like
a
flood
was
vanquished
by
the
magnetic
influence
of
her
lover
s
warmth
she
hesitated
to
begin
the
quarrel
that
must
part
them
forever
she
was
more
a
woman
than
she
thought
this
slight
creature
in
her
effort
to
reconcile
the
demands
of
religion
with
the
sensations
of
vanity
the
semblance
of
pleasure
which
turns
a
parisienne
s
head
every
sunday
she
went
to
mass
she
never
missed
a
service
then
when
evening
came
she
was
steeped
in
the
intoxicating
bliss
of
repressed
desire
armand
and
mme
de
langeais
like
hindoo
fakirs
found
the
reward
of
their
continence
in
the
temptations
to
which
it
gave
rise
possibly
the
duchess
had
ended
by
resolving
love
into
fraternal
caresses
harmless
enough
as
it
might
have
seemed
to
the
rest
of
the
world
while
they
borrowed
extremes
of
degradation
from
the
license
of
her
thoughts
how
else
explain
the
incomprehensible
mystery
of
her
continual
fluctuations
every
morning
she
proposed
to
herself
to
shut
her
door
on
the
marquis
de
montriveau
every
evening
at
the
appointed
hour
she
fell
under
the
charm
of
his
presence
there
was
a
languid
defence
then
she
grew
less
unkind
her
words
were
sweet
and
soothing
they
were
lovers
lovers
only
could
have
been
thus
for
him
the
duchess
would
display
her
most
sparkling
wit
her
most
captivating
wiles
and
when
at
last
she
had
wrought
upon
his
senses
and
his
soul
she
might
submit
herself
passively
to
his
fierce
caresses
but
she
had
her
plus
of
passion
and
when
once
it
was
reached
she
grew
angry
if
he
lost
the
mastery
of
himself
and
made
as
though
he
would
pass
beyond
no
woman
on
earth
can
brave
the
consequences
of
refusal
without
some
motive
nothing
is
more
natural
than
to
yield
to
love
wherefore
mme
de
langeais
promptly
raised
a
second
line
of
fortification
a
stronghold
less
easy
to
carry
than
the
first
she
evoked
the
terrors
of
religion
never
did
father
of
the
church
however
eloquent
plead
the
cause
of
god
better
than
the
duchess
never
was
the
wrath
of
the
most
high
better
justified
than
by
her
voice
she
used
no
preacher
s
commonplaces
no
rhetorical
amplifications
no
she
had
a
of
her
own
to
armand
s
most
passionate
entreaty
she
replied
with
a
tearful
gaze
and
a
gesture
in
which
a
terrible
plenitude
of
emotion
found
expression
she
stopped
his
mouth
with
an
appeal
for
mercy
she
would
not
hear
another
word
if
she
did
she
must
succumb
and
better
death
than
criminal
happiness
is
it
nothing
to
disobey
god
she
asked
him
recovering
a
voice
grown
faint
in
the
crises
of
inward
struggles
through
which
the
fair
actress
appeared
to
find
it
hard
to
preserve
her
i
would
sacrifice
society
i
would
give
up
the
whole
world
for
you
gladly
but
it
is
very
selfish
of
you
to
ask
my
whole
of
me
for
a
moment
of
pleasure
come
now
are
you
not
happy
she
added
holding
out
her
hand
and
certainly
in
her
careless
toilette
the
sight
of
her
afforded
consolations
to
her
lover
who
made
the
most
of
them
sometimes
from
policy
to
keep
her
hold
on
a
man
whose
ardent
passion
gave
her
emotions
unknown
before
sometimes
in
weakness
she
suffered
him
to
snatch
a
swift
kiss
and
immediately
in
feigned
terror
she
flushed
red
and
exiled
armand
from
the
sofa
so
soon
as
the
sofa
became
dangerous
ground
your
joys
are
sins
for
me
to
expiate
armand
they
are
paid
for
by
penitence
and
remorse
she
cried
and
montriveau
now
at
two
chairs
distance
from
that
aristocratic
petticoat
betook
himself
to
blasphemy
and
railed
against
providence
the
duchess
grew
angry
at
such
times
my
friend
she
said
drily
i
do
not
understand
why
you
decline
to
believe
in
god
for
it
is
impossible
to
believe
in
man
hush
do
not
talk
like
that
you
have
too
great
a
nature
to
take
up
their
liberal
nonsense
with
its
pretension
to
abolish
theological
and
political
disputes
acted
like
a
cold
douche
on
montriveau
he
calmed
down
he
could
not
return
to
love
when
the
duchess
stirred
up
his
wrath
by
suddenly
setting
him
down
a
thousand
miles
away
from
the
boudoir
discussing
theories
of
absolute
monarchy
which
she
defended
to
admiration
few
women
venture
to
be
democrats
the
attitude
of
democratic
champion
is
scarcely
compatible
with
tyrannous
feminine
sway
but
often
on
the
other
hand
the
general
shook
out
his
mane
dropped
politics
with
a
leonine
growling
and
lashing
of
the
flanks
and
sprang
upon
his
prey
he
was
no
longer
capable
of
carrying
a
heart
and
brain
at
such
variance
for
very
far
he
came
back
terrible
with
love
to
his
mistress
and
she
if
she
felt
the
prick
of
fancy
stimulated
to
a
dangerous
point
knew
that
it
was
time
to
leave
her
boudoir
she
came
out
of
the
atmosphere
surcharged
with
desires
that
she
drew
in
with
her
breath
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
sang
the
most
exquisite
songs
of
modern
music
and
so
baffled
the
physical
attraction
which
at
times
showed
her
no
mercy
though
she
was
strong
enough
to
fight
it
down
at
such
times
she
was
something
sublime
in
armand
s
eyes
she
was
not
acting
she
was
genuine
the
unhappy
lover
was
convinced
that
she
loved
him
her
egoistic
resistance
deluded
him
into
a
belief
that
she
was
a
pure
and
sainted
woman
he
resigned
himself
he
talked
of
platonic
love
did
this
artillery
officer
when
mme
de
langeais
had
played
with
religion
sufficiently
to
suit
her
own
purposes
she
played
with
it
again
for
armand
s
benefit
she
wanted
to
bring
him
back
to
a
christian
frame
of
mind
she
brought
out
her
edition
of
genie
du
adapted
for
the
use
of
military
men
montriveau
chafed
his
yoke
was
heavy
oh
at
that
possessed
by
the
spirit
of
contradiction
she
dinned
religion
into
his
ears
to
see
whether
god
might
not
rid
her
of
this
suitor
for
the
man
s
persistence
was
beginning
to
frighten
her
and
in
any
case
she
was
glad
to
prolong
any
quarrel
if
it
bade
fair
to
keep
the
dispute
on
moral
grounds
for
an
indefinite
period
the
material
struggle
which
followed
it
was
more
dangerous
but
if
the
time
of
her
opposition
on
the
ground
of
the
marriage
law
might
be
said
to
be
the
of
this
sentimental
warfare
the
ensuing
phase
which
might
be
taken
to
constitute
the
had
also
its
crisis
and
consequent
decline
of
severity
armand
happening
to
come
in
very
early
one
evening
found
l
abbe
gondrand
the
duchess
s
spiritual
director
established
in
an
armchair
by
the
fireside
looking
as
a
spiritual
director
might
be
expected
to
look
while
digesting
his
dinner
and
the
charming
sins
of
his
penitent
in
the
ecclesiastic
s
bearing
there
was
a
stateliness
befitting
a
dignitary
of
the
church
and
the
episcopal
violet
hue
already
appeared
in
his
dress
at
sight
of
his
fresh
complexion
smooth
forehead
and
ascetic
s
mouth
montriveau
s
countenance
grew
uncommonly
dark
he
said
not
a
word
under
the
malicious
scrutiny
of
the
other
s
gaze
and
greeted
neither
the
lady
nor
the
priest
the
lover
apart
montriveau
was
not
wanting
in
tact
so
a
few
glances
exchanged
with
the
told
him
that
here
was
the
real
forger
of
the
duchess
s
armory
of
scruples
that
an
ambitious
abbe
should
control
the
happiness
of
a
man
of
montriveau
s
temper
and
by
underhand
ways
the
thought
burst
in
a
furious
tide
over
his
face
clenched
his
fists
and
set
him
chafing
and
pacing
to
and
fro
but
when
he
came
back
to
his
place
intending
to
make
a
scene
a
single
look
from
the
duchess
was
enough
he
was
quiet
any
other
woman
would
have
been
put
out
by
her
lover
s
gloomy
silence
it
was
quite
otherwise
with
mme
de
langeais
she
continued
her
conversation
with
de
gondrand
on
the
necessity
of
the
church
in
its
ancient
splendour
and
she
talked
brilliantly
the
church
she
maintained
ought
to
be
a
temporal
as
well
as
a
spiritual
power
stating
her
case
better
than
the
abbe
had
done
and
regretting
that
the
chamber
of
peers
unlike
the
english
house
of
lords
had
no
bench
of
bishops
nevertheless
the
abbe
rose
yielded
his
place
to
the
general
and
took
his
leave
knowing
that
in
lent
he
could
play
a
return
game
as
for
the
duchess
montriveau
s
behaviour
had
excited
her
curiosity
to
such
a
pitch
that
she
scarcely
rose
to
return
her
director
s
low
bow
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
friend
why
i
can
not
stomach
that
abbe
of
why
did
you
not
take
a
book
she
asked
careless
whether
the
abbe
then
closing
the
door
heard
her
or
no
the
general
paused
for
the
gesture
which
accompanied
the
duchess
s
speech
further
increased
the
exceeding
insolence
of
her
words
my
dear
antoinette
thank
you
for
giving
love
precedence
of
the
church
but
for
pity
s
sake
allow
me
to
ask
one
oh
you
are
questioning
me
i
am
quite
willing
you
are
my
friend
are
you
not
i
certainly
can
open
the
bottom
of
my
heart
to
you
you
will
see
only
one
image
do
you
talk
about
our
love
to
that
man
he
is
my
does
he
know
that
i
love
you
m
de
montriveau
you
can
not
claim
i
think
to
penetrate
the
secrets
of
the
confessional
does
that
man
know
all
about
our
quarrels
and
my
love
for
you
that
man
monsieur
say
god
god
again
ought
to
be
alone
in
your
heart
but
leave
god
alone
where
he
is
for
the
love
of
god
and
me
madame
you
go
to
confession
again
or
or
she
repeated
sweetly
or
i
will
never
come
back
then
go
armand
she
rose
and
went
to
her
boudoir
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
armand
as
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
back
of
a
chair
how
long
he
stood
there
motionless
he
himself
never
knew
the
soul
within
has
the
mysterious
power
of
expanding
as
of
contracting
space
he
opened
the
door
of
the
boudoir
it
was
dark
within
a
faint
voice
was
raised
to
say
sharply
i
did
not
ring
what
made
you
come
in
without
orders
go
away
then
you
are
ill
exclaimed
montriveau
stand
up
monsieur
and
go
out
of
the
room
for
a
minute
at
any
rate
she
said
ringing
the
bell
mme
la
duchesse
rang
for
lights
said
the
footman
coming
in
with
the
candles
when
the
lovers
were
alone
together
mme
de
langeais
still
lay
on
her
couch
she
was
just
as
silent
and
motionless
as
if
montriveau
had
not
been
there
dear
i
was
wrong
he
began
a
note
of
pain
and
a
sublime
kindness
in
his
voice
indeed
i
would
not
have
you
without
religion
it
is
fortunate
that
you
can
recognise
the
necessity
of
a
conscience
she
said
in
a
hard
voice
without
looking
at
him
i
thank
you
in
god
s
the
general
was
broken
down
by
her
harshness
this
woman
seemed
as
if
she
could
be
at
will
a
sister
or
a
stranger
to
him
he
made
one
despairing
stride
towards
the
door
he
would
leave
her
forever
without
another
word
he
was
wretched
and
the
duchess
was
laughing
within
herself
over
mental
anguish
far
more
cruel
than
the
old
judicial
torture
but
as
for
going
away
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
do
it
in
any
sort
of
crisis
a
woman
is
as
it
were
bursting
with
a
certain
quantity
of
things
to
say
so
long
as
she
has
not
delivered
herself
of
them
she
experiences
the
sensation
which
we
are
apt
to
feel
at
the
sight
of
something
incomplete
mme
de
langeais
had
not
said
all
that
was
in
her
mind
she
took
up
her
parable
and
said
we
have
not
the
same
convictions
general
i
am
pained
to
think
it
would
be
dreadful
if
a
woman
could
not
believe
in
a
religion
which
permits
us
to
love
beyond
the
grave
i
set
christian
sentiments
aside
you
can
not
understand
them
let
me
simply
speak
to
you
of
expediency
would
you
forbid
a
woman
at
court
the
table
of
the
lord
when
it
is
customary
to
take
the
sacrament
at
easter
people
must
certainly
do
something
for
their
party
the
liberals
whatever
they
may
wish
to
do
will
never
destroy
the
religious
instinct
religion
will
always
be
a
political
necessity
would
you
undertake
to
govern
a
nation
of
napoleon
was
afraid
to
try
he
persecuted
ideologists
if
you
want
to
keep
people
from
reasoning
you
must
give
them
something
to
feel
so
let
us
accept
the
roman
catholic
church
with
all
its
consequences
and
if
we
would
have
france
go
to
mass
ought
we
not
to
begin
by
going
ourselves
religion
you
see
armand
is
a
bond
uniting
all
the
conservative
principles
which
enable
the
rich
to
live
in
tranquillity
religion
and
the
rights
of
property
are
intimately
connected
it
is
certainly
a
finer
thing
to
lead
a
nation
by
ideas
of
morality
than
by
fear
of
the
scaffold
as
in
the
time
of
the
terror
the
one
method
by
which
your
odious
revolution
could
enforce
obedience
the
priest
and
the
king
that
means
you
and
me
and
the
princess
my
neighbour
and
in
a
word
the
interests
of
all
honest
people
personified
there
my
friend
just
be
so
good
as
to
belong
to
your
party
you
that
might
be
its
scylla
if
you
had
the
slightest
ambition
that
way
i
know
nothing
about
politics
myself
i
argue
from
my
own
feelings
but
still
i
know
enough
to
guess
that
society
would
be
overturned
if
people
were
always
calling
its
foundations
in
question
if
that
is
how
your
court
and
your
government
think
i
am
sorry
for
you
broke
in
montriveau
the
restoration
madam
ought
to
say
like
catherine
de
medici
when
she
heard
that
the
battle
of
dreux
was
lost
very
well
now
we
will
go
to
the
now
was
your
battle
of
dreux
like
the
royal
power
of
those
days
you
won
in
fact
while
you
lost
in
right
political
protestantism
has
gained
an
ascendancy
over
people
s
minds
if
you
have
no
mind
to
issue
your
edict
of
nantes
or
if
when
it
is
issued
you
publish
a
revocation
if
you
should
one
day
be
accused
and
convicted
of
repudiating
the
charter
which
is
simply
a
pledge
given
to
maintain
the
interests
established
under
the
republic
then
the
revolution
will
rise
again
terrible
in
her
strength
and
strike
but
a
single
blow
it
will
not
be
the
revolution
that
will
go
into
exile
she
is
the
very
soil
of
france
men
die
but
people
s
interests
do
not
die
eh
great
heavens
what
are
france
and
the
crown
and
rightful
sovereigns
and
the
whole
world
besides
to
us
idle
words
compared
with
my
happiness
let
them
reign
or
be
hurled
from
the
throne
little
do
i
care
where
am
i
now
in
the
duchesse
de
langeais
boudoir
my
no
no
no
more
of
the
duchess
no
more
of
langeais
i
am
with
my
dear
will
you
do
me
the
pleasure
to
stay
where
you
are
she
said
laughing
and
pushing
him
back
gently
however
so
you
have
never
loved
me
he
retorted
and
anger
flashed
in
lightning
from
his
eyes
no
dear
but
the
no
was
equivalent
to
i
am
a
great
ass
he
said
kissing
her
hands
the
terrible
queen
was
a
woman
once
antoinette
he
went
on
laying
his
head
on
her
feet
you
are
too
chastely
tender
to
speak
of
our
happiness
to
anyone
in
this
oh
she
cried
rising
to
her
feet
with
a
swift
graceful
spring
you
are
a
great
and
without
another
word
she
fled
into
the
what
is
it
now
wondered
the
general
little
knowing
that
the
touch
of
his
burning
forehead
had
sent
a
swift
electric
thrill
through
her
from
foot
to
head
in
hot
wrath
he
followed
her
to
the
only
to
hear
divinely
sweet
chords
the
duchess
was
at
the
piano
if
the
man
of
science
or
the
poet
can
at
once
enjoy
and
comprehend
bringing
his
intelligence
to
bear
upon
his
enjoyment
without
loss
of
delight
he
is
conscious
that
the
alphabet
and
phraseology
of
music
are
but
cunning
instruments
for
the
composer
like
the
wood
and
copper
wire
under
the
hands
of
the
executant
for
the
poet
and
the
man
of
science
there
is
a
music
existing
apart
underlying
the
double
expression
of
this
language
of
the
spirit
and
senses
mio
can
draw
tears
of
joy
or
pitying
laughter
at
the
will
of
the
singer
and
not
unfrequently
one
here
and
there
in
the
world
some
girl
unable
to
live
and
bear
the
heavy
burden
of
an
unguessed
pain
some
man
whose
soul
vibrates
with
the
throb
of
passion
may
take
up
a
musical
theme
and
lo
heaven
is
opened
for
them
or
they
find
a
language
for
themselves
in
some
sublime
melody
some
song
lost
to
the
world
the
general
was
listening
now
to
such
a
song
a
mysterious
music
unknown
to
all
other
ears
as
the
solitary
plaint
of
some
mateless
bird
dying
alone
in
a
virgin
forest
great
heavens
what
are
you
playing
there
he
asked
in
an
unsteady
voice
the
prelude
of
a
ballad
called
i
believe
du
i
did
not
know
that
there
was
such
music
in
a
piano
he
returned
ah
she
said
and
for
the
first
time
she
looked
at
him
as
a
woman
looks
at
the
man
she
loves
nor
do
you
know
my
friend
that
i
love
you
and
that
you
cause
me
horrible
suffering
and
that
i
feel
that
i
must
utter
my
cry
of
pain
without
putting
it
too
plainly
into
words
if
i
did
not
i
should
yield
but
you
see
and
you
will
not
make
me
happy
armand
i
should
die
of
sorrow
the
next
the
general
turned
abruptly
from
her
and
went
but
out
in
the
street
he
brushed
away
the
tears
that
he
would
not
let
fall
the
religious
phase
lasted
for
three
months
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
duchess
grew
weary
of
vain
repetitions
the
deity
bound
hand
and
foot
was
delivered
up
to
her
lover
possibly
she
may
have
feared
that
by
sheer
dint
of
talking
of
eternity
she
might
perpetuate
his
love
in
this
world
and
the
next
for
her
own
sake
it
must
be
believed
that
no
man
had
touched
her
heart
or
her
conduct
would
be
inexcusable
she
was
young
the
time
when
men
and
women
feel
that
they
can
not
afford
to
lose
time
or
to
quibble
over
their
joys
was
still
far
off
she
no
doubt
was
on
the
verge
not
of
first
love
but
of
her
first
experience
of
the
bliss
of
love
and
from
inexperience
for
want
of
the
painful
lessons
which
would
have
taught
her
to
value
the
treasure
poured
out
at
her
feet
she
was
playing
with
it
knowing
nothing
of
the
glory
and
rapture
of
the
light
she
was
fain
to
stay
in
the
shadow
armand
was
just
beginning
to
understand
this
strange
situation
he
put
his
hope
in
the
first
word
spoken
by
nature
every
evening
as
he
came
away
from
mme
de
langeais
he
told
himself
that
no
woman
would
accept
the
tenderest
most
delicate
proofs
of
a
man
s
love
during
seven
months
nor
yield
passively
to
the
slighter
demands
of
passion
only
to
cheat
love
at
the
last
he
was
waiting
patiently
for
the
sun
to
gain
power
not
doubting
but
that
he
should
receive
the
earliest
fruits
the
married
woman
s
hesitations
and
the
religious
scruples
he
could
quite
well
understand
he
even
rejoiced
over
those
battles
he
mistook
the
duchess
s
heartless
coquetry
for
modesty
and
he
would
not
have
had
her
otherwise
so
he
had
loved
to
see
her
devising
obstacles
was
he
not
gradually
triumphing
over
them
did
not
every
victory
won
swell
the
meagre
sum
of
lovers
intimacies
long
denied
and
at
last
conceded
with
every
sign
of
love
still
he
had
had
such
leisure
to
taste
the
full
sweetness
of
every
small
successive
conquest
on
which
a
lover
feeds
his
love
that
these
had
come
to
be
matters
of
use
and
wont
so
far
as
obstacles
went
there
were
none
now
save
his
own
awe
of
her
nothing
else
left
between
him
and
his
desire
save
the
whims
of
her
who
allowed
him
to
call
her
antoinette
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
demand
more
to
demand
all
embarrassed
like
a
young
lover
who
can
not
dare
to
believe
that
his
idol
can
stoop
so
low
he
hesitated
for
a
long
time
he
passed
through
the
experience
of
terrible
reactions
within
himself
a
set
purpose
was
annihilated
by
a
word
and
definite
resolves
died
within
him
on
the
threshold
he
despised
himself
for
his
weakness
and
still
his
desire
remained
unuttered
nevertheless
one
evening
after
sitting
in
gloomy
melancholy
he
brought
out
a
fierce
demand
for
his
illegally
legitimate
rights
the
duchess
had
not
to
wait
for
her
s
request
to
guess
his
desire
when
was
a
man
s
desire
a
secret
and
have
not
women
an
intuitive
knowledge
of
the
meaning
of
certain
changes
of
countenance
what
you
wish
to
be
my
friend
no
longer
she
broke
in
at
the
first
words
and
a
divine
red
surging
like
new
blood
under
the
transparent
skin
lent
brightness
to
her
eyes
as
a
reward
for
my
generosity
you
would
dishonor
me
just
reflect
a
little
i
myself
have
thought
much
over
this
and
i
think
always
for
us
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
woman
s
loyalty
and
we
can
no
more
fail
in
it
than
you
can
fail
in
honour
can
not
blind
myself
if
i
am
yours
how
in
any
sense
can
i
be
de
langeais
wife
can
you
require
the
sacrifice
of
my
position
my
rank
my
whole
life
in
return
for
a
doubtful
love
that
could
not
wait
patiently
for
seven
months
what
already
you
would
rob
me
of
my
right
to
dispose
of
myself
no
no
you
must
not
talk
like
this
again
no
not
another
word
i
will
not
i
can
not
listen
to
mme
de
langeais
raised
both
hands
to
her
head
to
push
back
the
tufted
curls
from
her
hot
forehead
she
seemed
very
much
excited
you
come
to
a
weak
woman
with
your
purpose
definitely
planned
out
you
say
for
a
certain
length
of
time
she
will
talk
to
me
of
her
husband
then
of
god
and
then
of
the
inevitable
consequences
but
i
will
use
and
abuse
the
ascendancy
i
shall
gain
over
her
i
will
make
myself
indispensable
all
the
bonds
of
habit
all
the
misconstructions
of
outsiders
will
make
for
me
and
at
length
when
our
is
taken
for
granted
by
all
the
world
i
shall
be
this
woman
s
now
be
frank
these
are
your
thoughts
oh
you
calculate
and
you
say
that
you
love
shame
on
you
you
are
enamoured
ah
that
i
well
believe
you
wish
to
possess
me
to
have
me
for
your
mistress
that
is
all
very
well
then
no
the
de
will
not
descend
so
far
simple
may
be
the
victims
of
your
treachery
i
never
nothing
gives
me
assurance
of
your
love
you
speak
of
my
beauty
i
may
lose
every
trace
of
it
in
six
months
like
the
dear
princess
my
neighbour
you
are
captivated
by
my
wit
my
grace
great
heavens
you
would
soon
grow
used
to
them
and
to
the
pleasures
of
possession
have
not
the
little
concessions
that
i
was
weak
enough
to
make
come
to
be
a
matter
of
course
in
the
last
few
months
some
day
when
ruin
comes
you
will
give
me
no
reason
for
the
change
in
you
beyond
a
curt
i
have
ceased
to
care
for
then
rank
and
fortune
and
honour
and
all
that
was
the
duchesse
de
langeais
will
be
swallowed
up
in
one
disappointed
hope
i
shall
have
children
to
bear
witness
to
my
shame
and
with
an
involuntary
gesture
she
interrupted
herself
and
continued
but
i
am
too
to
explain
all
this
to
you
when
you
know
it
better
than
i
come
let
us
stay
as
we
are
i
am
only
too
fortunate
in
that
i
can
still
break
these
bonds
which
you
think
so
strong
is
there
anything
so
very
heroic
in
coming
to
the
hotel
de
langeais
to
spend
an
evening
with
a
woman
whose
prattle
amuses
you
a
woman
whom
you
take
for
a
plaything
why
half
a
dozen
young
coxcombs
come
here
just
as
regularly
every
afternoon
between
three
and
five
they
too
are
very
generous
i
am
to
suppose
i
make
fun
of
them
they
stand
my
petulance
and
insolence
pretty
quietly
and
make
me
laugh
but
as
for
you
i
give
all
the
treasures
of
my
soul
to
you
and
you
wish
to
ruin
me
you
try
my
patience
in
endless
ways
hush
that
will
do
that
will
do
she
continued
seeing
that
he
was
about
to
speak
you
have
no
heart
no
soul
no
delicacy
i
know
what
you
want
to
tell
me
very
well
then
yes
i
would
rather
you
should
take
me
for
a
cold
insensible
woman
with
no
devotion
in
her
composition
no
heart
even
than
be
taken
by
everybody
else
for
a
vulgar
person
and
be
condemned
to
your
pleasures
of
which
you
would
most
certainly
tire
and
to
everlasting
punishment
for
it
afterwards
your
selfish
love
is
not
worth
so
many
sacrifices
the
words
give
but
a
very
inadequate
idea
of
the
discourse
which
the
duchess
trilled
out
with
the
quick
volubility
of
a
nor
truly
was
there
anything
to
prevent
her
from
talking
on
for
some
time
to
come
for
poor
armand
s
only
reply
to
the
torrent
of
flute
notes
was
a
silence
filled
with
cruelly
painful
thoughts
he
was
just
beginning
to
see
that
this
woman
was
playing
with
him
he
divined
instinctively
that
a
devoted
love
a
responsive
love
does
not
reason
and
count
the
consequences
in
this
way
then
as
he
heard
her
reproach
him
with
detestable
motives
he
felt
something
like
shame
as
he
remembered
that
unconsciously
he
had
made
those
very
calculations
with
angelic
honesty
of
purpose
he
looked
within
and
found
nothing
but
selfishness
in
all
his
thoughts
and
motives
in
the
answers
which
he
framed
and
could
not
utter
he
was
in
his
despair
he
longed
to
fling
himself
from
the
window
the
egoism
of
it
was
intolerable
what
indeed
can
a
man
say
when
a
woman
will
not
believe
in
love
let
me
prove
how
much
i
love
the
is
always
there
the
heroes
of
the
boudoir
in
such
circumstances
can
follow
the
example
of
the
primitive
logician
who
preceded
the
pyrrhonists
and
denied
movement
montriveau
was
not
equal
to
this
feat
with
all
his
audacity
he
lacked
this
precise
kind
which
never
deserts
an
adept
in
the
formulas
of
feminine
algebra
if
so
many
women
and
even
the
best
of
women
fall
a
prey
to
a
kind
of
expert
to
whom
the
vulgar
give
a
grosser
name
it
is
perhaps
because
the
said
experts
are
great
and
love
in
spite
of
its
delicious
poetry
of
sentiment
requires
a
little
more
geometry
than
people
are
wont
to
think
now
the
duchess
and
montriveau
were
alike
in
this
they
were
both
equally
unversed
in
love
lore
the
lady
s
knowledge
of
theory
was
but
scanty
in
practice
she
knew
nothing
whatever
she
felt
nothing
and
reflected
over
everything
montriveau
had
had
but
little
experience
was
absolutely
ignorant
of
theory
and
felt
too
much
to
reflect
at
all
both
therefore
were
enduring
the
consequences
of
the
singular
situation
at
that
supreme
moment
the
myriad
thoughts
in
his
mind
might
have
been
reduced
to
the
formula
submit
to
be
mine
words
which
seem
horribly
selfish
to
a
woman
for
whom
they
awaken
no
memories
recall
no
ideas
something
nevertheless
he
must
say
and
what
was
more
though
her
barbed
shafts
had
set
his
blood
tingling
though
the
short
phrases
that
she
discharged
at
him
one
by
one
were
very
keen
and
sharp
and
cold
he
must
control
himself
lest
he
should
lose
all
by
an
outbreak
of
anger
mme
la
duchesse
i
am
in
despair
that
god
should
have
invented
no
way
for
a
woman
to
confirm
the
gift
of
her
heart
save
by
adding
the
gift
of
her
person
the
high
value
which
you
yourself
put
upon
the
gift
teaches
me
that
i
can
not
attach
less
importance
to
it
if
you
have
given
me
your
inmost
self
and
your
whole
heart
as
you
tell
me
what
can
the
rest
matter
and
besides
if
my
happiness
means
so
painful
a
sacrifice
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
but
you
must
pardon
a
man
of
spirit
if
he
feels
humiliated
at
being
taken
for
a
the
tone
in
which
the
last
remark
was
uttered
might
perhaps
have
frightened
another
woman
but
when
the
wearer
of
a
petticoat
has
allowed
herself
to
be
addressed
as
a
divinity
and
thereby
set
herself
above
all
other
mortals
no
power
on
earth
can
be
so
haughty
m
le
marquis
i
am
in
despair
that
god
should
not
have
invented
some
nobler
way
for
a
man
to
confirm
the
gift
of
his
heart
than
by
the
manifestation
of
prodigiously
vulgar
desires
we
become
when
we
give
ourselves
body
and
soul
but
a
man
is
bound
to
nothing
by
accepting
the
gift
who
will
assure
me
that
love
will
last
the
very
love
that
i
might
show
for
you
at
every
moment
the
better
to
keep
your
love
might
serve
you
as
a
reason
for
deserting
me
i
have
no
wish
to
be
a
second
edition
of
mme
de
beauseant
who
can
ever
know
what
it
is
that
keeps
you
beside
us
our
persistent
coldness
of
heart
is
the
cause
of
an
unfailing
passion
in
some
of
you
other
men
ask
for
an
untiring
devotion
to
be
idolized
at
every
moment
some
for
gentleness
others
for
tyranny
no
woman
in
this
world
as
yet
has
really
read
the
riddle
of
man
s
there
was
a
pause
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
in
a
different
tone
after
all
my
friend
you
can
not
prevent
a
woman
from
trembling
at
the
question
will
this
love
last
always
hard
though
my
words
may
be
the
dread
of
losing
you
puts
them
into
my
mouth
oh
me
it
is
not
i
who
speaks
dear
it
is
reason
and
how
should
anyone
so
mad
as
i
be
reasonable
in
truth
i
am
nothing
of
the
the
poignant
irony
of
her
answer
had
changed
before
the
end
into
the
most
musical
accents
in
which
a
woman
could
find
utterance
for
ingenuous
love
to
listen
to
her
words
was
to
pass
in
a
moment
from
martyrdom
to
heaven
montriveau
grew
pale
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
a
woman
he
kissed
the
duchess
s
skirt
hem
her
knees
her
feet
but
for
the
credit
of
the
faubourg
it
is
necessary
to
respect
the
mysteries
of
its
boudoirs
where
many
are
fain
to
take
the
utmost
that
love
can
give
without
giving
proof
of
love
in
return
the
duchess
thought
herself
generous
when
she
suffered
herself
to
be
adored
but
montriveau
was
in
a
wild
frenzy
of
joy
over
her
complete
surrender
of
the
position
dear
antoinette
he
cried
yes
you
are
right
i
will
not
have
you
doubt
any
longer
i
too
am
trembling
at
this
moment
lest
the
angel
of
my
life
should
leave
me
i
wish
i
could
invent
some
tie
that
might
bind
us
to
each
other
ah
she
said
under
her
breath
so
i
was
right
you
let
me
say
all
that
i
have
to
say
i
will
scatter
all
your
fears
with
a
word
listen
if
i
deserted
you
i
should
deserve
to
die
a
thousand
deaths
be
wholly
mine
and
i
will
give
you
the
right
to
kill
me
if
i
am
false
i
myself
will
write
a
letter
explaining
certain
reasons
for
taking
my
own
life
i
will
make
my
final
arrangements
in
short
you
shall
have
the
letter
in
your
keeping
in
the
eye
of
the
law
it
will
be
a
sufficient
explanation
of
my
death
you
can
avenge
yourself
and
fear
nothing
from
god
or
what
good
would
the
letter
be
to
me
what
would
life
be
if
i
had
lost
your
love
if
i
wished
to
kill
you
should
i
not
be
ready
to
follow
no
thank
you
for
the
thought
but
i
do
not
want
the
letter
should
i
not
begin
to
dread
that
you
were
faithful
to
me
through
fear
and
if
a
man
knows
that
he
must
risk
his
life
for
a
stolen
pleasure
might
it
not
seem
more
tempting
armand
the
thing
i
ask
of
you
is
the
one
hard
thing
to
then
what
is
it
that
you
wish
your
obedience
and
my
ah
god
cried
he
i
am
a
a
wayward
much
spoilt
child
she
said
stroking
the
thick
hair
for
his
head
still
lay
on
her
knee
ah
and
loved
far
more
than
he
believes
and
yet
he
is
very
disobedient
why
not
stay
as
we
are
why
not
sacrifice
to
me
the
desires
that
hurt
me
why
not
take
what
i
can
give
when
it
is
all
that
i
can
honestly
grant
are
you
not
happy
oh
yes
i
am
happy
when
i
have
not
a
doubt
left
antoinette
doubt
in
love
is
a
kind
of
death
is
it
not
in
a
moment
he
showed
himself
as
he
was
as
all
men
are
under
the
influence
of
that
hot
fever
he
grew
eloquent
insinuating
and
the
duchess
tasted
the
pleasures
which
she
reconciled
with
her
conscience
by
some
private
jesuitical
ukase
of
her
own
armand
s
love
gave
her
a
thrill
of
cerebral
excitement
which
custom
made
as
necessary
to
her
as
society
or
the
opera
to
feel
that
she
was
adored
by
this
man
who
rose
above
other
men
whose
character
frightened
her
to
treat
him
like
a
child
to
play
with
him
as
poppaea
played
with
nero
many
women
like
the
wives
of
king
henry
viii
have
paid
for
such
a
perilous
delight
with
all
the
blood
in
their
veins
grim
presentiment
even
as
she
surrendered
the
delicate
pale
gold
curls
to
his
touch
and
felt
the
close
pressure
of
his
hand
the
little
hand
of
a
man
whose
greatness
she
could
not
mistake
even
as
she
herself
played
with
his
dark
thick
locks
in
that
boudoir
where
she
reigned
a
queen
the
duchess
would
say
to
herself
this
man
is
capable
of
killing
me
if
he
once
finds
out
that
i
am
playing
with
armand
de
montriveau
stayed
with
her
till
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
from
that
moment
this
woman
whom
he
loved
was
neither
a
duchess
nor
a
navarreins
antoinette
in
her
disguises
had
gone
so
far
as
to
appear
to
be
a
woman
on
that
most
blissful
evening
the
sweetest
prelude
ever
played
by
a
parisienne
to
what
the
world
calls
a
slip
in
spite
of
all
her
affectations
of
a
coyness
which
she
did
not
feel
the
general
saw
all
maidenly
beauty
in
her
he
had
some
excuse
for
believing
that
so
many
storms
of
caprice
had
been
but
clouds
covering
a
heavenly
soul
that
these
must
be
lifted
one
by
one
like
the
veils
that
hid
her
divine
loveliness
the
duchess
became
for
him
the
most
simple
and
girlish
mistress
she
was
the
one
woman
in
the
world
for
him
and
he
went
away
quite
happy
in
that
at
last
he
had
brought
her
to
give
him
such
pledges
of
love
that
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
but
that
he
should
be
but
her
husband
henceforth
in
secret
her
choice
sanctioned
by
heaven
armand
went
slowly
home
turning
this
thought
in
his
mind
with
the
impartiality
of
a
man
who
is
conscious
of
all
the
responsibilities
that
love
lays
on
him
while
he
tastes
the
sweetness
of
its
joys
he
went
along
the
quais
to
see
the
widest
possible
space
of
sky
his
heart
had
grown
in
him
he
would
fain
have
had
the
bounds
of
the
firmament
and
of
earth
enlarged
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
lungs
drew
an
ampler
breath
in
the
course
of
his
as
he
walked
he
vowed
to
love
this
woman
so
devoutly
that
every
day
of
her
life
she
should
find
absolution
for
her
sins
against
society
in
unfailing
happiness
sweet
stirrings
of
life
when
life
is
at
the
full
the
man
that
is
strong
enough
to
steep
his
soul
in
the
colour
of
one
emotion
feels
infinite
joy
as
glimpses
open
out
for
him
of
an
ardent
lifetime
that
knows
no
diminution
of
passion
to
the
end
even
so
it
is
permitted
to
certain
mystics
in
ecstasy
to
behold
the
light
of
god
love
would
be
naught
without
the
belief
that
it
would
last
forever
love
grows
great
through
constancy
it
was
thus
that
wholly
absorbed
by
his
happiness
montriveau
understood
passion
we
belong
to
each
other
forever
the
thought
was
like
a
talisman
fulfilling
the
wishes
of
his
life
he
did
not
ask
whether
the
duchess
might
not
change
whether
her
love
might
not
last
no
for
he
had
faith
without
that
virtue
there
is
no
future
for
christianity
and
perhaps
it
is
even
more
necessary
to
society
a
conception
of
life
as
feeling
occurred
to
him
for
the
first
time
hitherto
he
had
lived
by
action
the
most
strenuous
exertion
of
human
energies
the
physical
devotion
as
it
may
be
called
of
the
soldier
next
day
de
montriveau
went
early
in
the
direction
of
the
faubourg
he
had
made
an
appointment
at
a
house
not
far
from
the
hotel
de
langeais
and
the
business
over
he
went
thither
as
if
to
his
own
home
the
general
s
companion
chanced
to
be
a
man
for
whom
he
felt
a
kind
of
repulsion
whenever
he
met
him
in
other
houses
this
was
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
whose
reputation
had
grown
so
great
in
paris
boudoirs
he
was
witty
clever
and
what
was
more
courageous
he
set
the
fashion
to
all
the
young
men
in
paris
as
a
man
of
gallantry
his
success
and
experience
were
equally
matters
of
envy
and
neither
fortune
nor
birth
was
wanting
in
his
case
qualifications
which
add
such
lustre
in
paris
to
a
reputation
as
a
leader
of
fashion
where
are
you
going
asked
de
ronquerolles
to
mme
de
langeais
ah
true
i
forgot
that
you
had
allowed
her
to
lime
you
you
are
wasting
your
affections
on
her
when
they
might
be
much
better
employed
elsewhere
i
could
have
told
you
of
half
a
score
of
women
in
the
financial
world
any
one
of
them
a
thousand
times
better
worth
your
while
than
that
titled
courtesan
who
does
with
her
brains
what
less
artificial
women
do
with
what
is
this
my
dear
fellow
armand
broke
in
the
duchess
is
an
angel
of
ronquerolles
began
to
laugh
things
being
thus
dear
boy
said
he
it
is
my
duty
to
enlighten
you
just
a
word
there
is
no
harm
in
it
between
ourselves
has
the
duchess
surrendered
if
so
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
come
give
me
your
confidence
there
is
no
occasion
to
waste
your
time
in
grafting
your
great
nature
on
that
unthankful
stock
when
all
your
hopes
and
cultivation
will
come
to
armand
ingenuously
made
a
kind
of
general
report
of
his
position
enumerating
with
much
minuteness
the
slender
rights
so
hardly
won
ronquerolles
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
so
heartless
that
it
would
have
cost
any
other
man
his
life
but
from
their
manner
of
speaking
and
looking
at
each
other
during
that
colloquy
beneath
the
wall
in
a
corner
almost
as
remote
from
intrusion
as
the
desert
itself
it
was
easy
to
imagine
the
friendship
between
the
two
men
knew
no
bounds
and
that
no
power
on
earth
could
estrange
them
my
dear
armand
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
the
duchess
was
a
puzzle
to
you
i
would
have
given
you
a
little
advice
which
might
have
brought
your
flirtation
properly
through
you
must
know
to
begin
with
that
the
women
of
our
faubourg
like
any
other
women
love
to
steep
themselves
in
love
but
they
have
a
mind
to
possess
and
not
to
be
possessed
they
have
made
a
sort
of
compromise
with
human
nature
the
code
of
their
parish
gives
them
a
pretty
wide
latitude
short
of
the
last
transgression
the
sweets
enjoyed
by
this
fair
duchess
of
yours
are
so
many
venial
sins
to
be
washed
away
in
the
waters
of
penitence
but
if
you
had
the
impertinence
to
ask
in
earnest
for
the
moral
sin
to
which
naturally
you
are
sure
to
attach
the
highest
importance
you
would
see
the
deep
disdain
with
which
the
door
of
the
boudoir
and
the
house
would
be
incontinently
shut
upon
you
the
tender
antoinette
would
dismiss
everything
from
her
memory
you
would
be
less
than
a
cipher
for
her
she
would
wipe
away
your
kisses
my
dear
friend
as
indifferently
as
she
would
perform
her
ablutions
she
would
sponge
love
from
her
cheeks
as
she
washes
off
rouge
we
know
women
of
that
sort
the
parisienne
have
you
ever
noticed
a
grisette
tripping
along
the
street
her
face
is
as
good
as
a
picture
a
pretty
cap
fresh
cheeks
trim
hair
a
guileful
smile
and
the
rest
of
her
almost
neglected
is
not
this
true
to
the
life
well
that
is
the
parisienne
she
knows
that
her
face
is
all
that
will
be
seen
so
she
devotes
all
her
care
finery
and
vanity
to
her
head
the
duchess
is
the
same
the
head
is
everything
with
her
she
can
only
feel
through
her
intellect
her
heart
lies
in
her
brain
she
is
a
sort
of
intellectual
epicure
she
has
a
we
call
that
kind
of
poor
creature
a
lais
of
the
intellect
you
have
been
taken
in
like
a
boy
if
you
doubt
it
you
can
have
proof
of
it
tonight
this
morning
this
instant
go
up
to
her
try
the
demand
as
an
experiment
insist
peremptorily
if
it
is
refused
you
might
set
about
it
like
the
late
marechal
de
richelieu
and
get
nothing
for
your
armand
was
dumb
with
amazement
has
your
desire
reached
the
point
of
infatuation
i
want
her
at
any
cost
montriveau
cried
out
despairingly
very
well
now
look
here
be
as
inexorable
as
she
is
herself
try
to
humiliate
her
to
sting
her
vanity
do
try
to
move
her
heart
nor
her
soul
but
the
woman
s
nerves
and
temperament
for
she
is
both
nervous
and
lymphatic
if
you
can
once
awaken
desire
in
her
you
are
safe
but
you
must
drop
these
romantic
boyish
notions
of
yours
if
when
once
you
have
her
in
your
eagle
s
talons
you
yield
a
point
or
draw
back
if
you
so
much
as
stir
an
eyelid
if
she
thinks
that
she
can
regain
her
ascendancy
over
you
she
will
slip
out
of
your
clutches
like
a
fish
and
you
will
never
catch
her
again
be
as
inflexible
as
law
show
no
more
charity
than
the
headsman
hit
hard
and
then
hit
again
strike
and
keep
on
striking
as
if
you
were
giving
her
the
knout
duchesses
are
made
of
hard
stuff
my
dear
armand
there
is
a
sort
of
feminine
nature
that
is
only
softened
by
repeated
blows
and
as
suffering
develops
a
heart
in
women
of
that
sort
so
it
is
a
work
of
charity
not
to
spare
the
rod
do
you
persevere
ah
when
pain
has
thoroughly
relaxed
those
nerves
and
softened
the
fibres
that
you
take
to
be
so
pliant
and
yielding
when
a
shriveled
heart
has
learned
to
expand
and
contract
and
to
beat
under
this
discipline
when
the
brain
has
capitulated
then
perhaps
passion
may
enter
among
the
steel
springs
of
this
machinery
that
turns
out
tears
and
affectations
and
languors
and
melting
phrases
then
you
shall
see
a
most
magnificent
conflagration
always
supposing
that
the
chimney
takes
fire
the
steel
feminine
system
will
glow
like
iron
in
the
forge
that
kind
of
heat
lasts
longer
than
any
other
and
the
glow
of
it
may
possibly
turn
to
love
still
he
continued
i
have
my
doubts
and
after
all
is
it
worth
while
to
take
so
much
trouble
with
the
duchess
between
ourselves
a
man
of
my
stamp
ought
first
to
take
her
in
hand
and
break
her
in
i
would
make
a
charming
woman
of
her
she
is
a
thoroughbred
whereas
you
two
left
to
yourselves
will
never
get
beyond
the
a
b
but
you
are
in
love
with
her
and
just
now
you
might
not
perhaps
share
my
views
on
this
subject
a
pleasant
time
to
you
my
children
added
ronquerolles
after
a
pause
then
with
a
laugh
i
have
decided
myself
for
facile
beauties
they
are
tender
at
any
rate
the
natural
woman
appears
in
their
love
without
any
of
your
social
seasonings
a
woman
that
haggles
over
herself
my
poor
boy
and
only
means
to
inspire
love
well
have
her
like
an
extra
horse
for
show
the
match
between
the
sofa
and
confessional
black
and
white
queen
and
knight
conscientious
scruples
and
pleasure
is
an
uncommonly
amusing
game
of
chess
and
if
a
man
knows
the
game
let
him
be
never
so
little
of
a
rake
he
wins
in
three
moves
now
if
i
undertook
a
woman
of
that
sort
i
should
start
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
his
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
over
the
last
words
in
armand
s
ear
and
he
went
before
there
was
time
to
reply
as
for
montriveau
he
sprang
at
a
bound
across
the
courtyard
of
the
hotel
de
langeais
went
unannounced
up
the
stairs
straight
to
the
duchess
s
bedroom
this
is
an
thing
she
said
hastily
wrapping
her
about
her
armand
this
is
abominable
of
you
come
leave
the
room
i
beg
just
go
out
of
the
room
and
go
at
once
wait
for
me
in
the
come
now
dear
angel
has
a
plighted
lover
no
privilege
whatsoever
but
monsieur
it
is
in
the
worst
possible
taste
of
a
plighted
lover
or
a
wedded
husband
to
break
in
like
this
upon
his
he
came
up
to
the
duchess
took
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
tightly
to
him
forgive
dear
antoinette
but
a
host
of
horrid
doubts
are
fermenting
in
my
fie
oh
fie
on
you
doubts
all
but
justified
if
you
loved
me
would
you
make
this
quarrel
would
you
not
be
glad
to
see
me
would
you
not
have
felt
a
something
stir
in
your
heart
for
i
that
am
not
a
woman
feel
a
thrill
in
my
inmost
self
at
the
mere
sound
of
your
voice
often
in
a
ballroom
a
longing
has
come
upon
me
to
spring
to
your
side
and
put
my
arms
about
your
oh
if
you
have
doubts
of
me
so
long
as
i
am
not
ready
to
spring
to
your
arms
before
all
the
world
i
shall
be
doubted
all
my
life
long
i
suppose
why
othello
was
a
mere
child
compared
with
you
ah
he
cried
despairingly
you
have
no
love
for
me
admit
at
any
rate
that
at
this
moment
you
are
not
then
i
have
still
to
find
favour
in
your
sight
oh
i
should
think
so
come
added
she
with
a
little
imperious
air
go
out
of
the
room
leave
me
i
am
not
like
you
i
wish
always
to
find
favour
in
your
never
woman
better
understood
the
art
of
putting
charm
into
insolence
and
does
not
the
charm
double
the
effect
is
it
not
enough
to
infuriate
the
coolest
of
men
there
was
a
sort
of
untrammeled
freedom
about
mme
de
langeais
a
something
in
her
eyes
her
voice
her
attitude
which
is
never
seen
in
a
woman
who
loves
when
she
stands
face
to
face
with
him
at
the
mere
sight
of
whom
her
heart
must
needs
begin
to
beat
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
counsels
had
cured
armand
of
sheepishness
and
further
there
came
to
his
aid
that
rapid
power
of
intuition
which
passion
will
develop
at
moments
in
the
least
wise
among
mortals
while
a
great
man
at
such
a
time
possesses
it
to
the
full
he
guessed
the
terrible
truth
revealed
by
the
duchess
s
nonchalance
and
his
heart
swelled
with
the
storm
like
a
lake
rising
in
flood
if
you
told
me
the
truth
yesterday
be
mine
dear
antoinette
he
cried
you
shall
in
the
first
place
said
she
composedly
thrusting
him
back
as
he
came
nearer
in
the
first
place
you
are
not
to
compromise
me
my
woman
might
overhear
you
respect
me
i
beg
of
you
your
familiarity
is
all
very
well
in
my
boudoir
in
an
evening
here
it
is
quite
different
besides
what
may
your
you
shall
mean
you
no
one
as
yet
has
ever
used
that
word
to
me
it
is
quite
ridiculous
it
seems
to
me
absolutely
ridiculous
will
you
surrender
nothing
to
me
on
this
point
oh
do
you
call
a
woman
s
right
to
dispose
of
herself
a
point
a
capital
point
indeed
you
will
permit
me
to
be
entirely
my
own
mistress
on
that
and
how
if
believing
in
your
promises
to
me
i
should
absolutely
require
it
oh
then
you
would
prove
that
i
made
the
greatest
possible
mistake
when
i
made
you
a
promise
of
any
kind
and
i
should
beg
you
to
leave
me
in
the
general
s
face
grew
white
he
was
about
to
spring
to
her
side
when
mme
de
langeais
rang
the
bell
the
maid
appeared
and
smiling
with
a
mocking
grace
the
duchess
added
be
so
good
as
to
return
when
i
am
then
montriveau
felt
the
hardness
of
a
woman
as
cold
and
keen
as
a
steel
blade
she
was
crushing
in
her
scorn
in
one
moment
she
had
snapped
the
bonds
which
held
firm
only
for
her
lover
she
had
read
armand
s
intention
in
his
face
and
held
that
the
moment
had
come
for
teaching
the
imperial
soldier
his
lesson
he
was
to
be
made
to
feel
that
though
duchesses
may
lend
themselves
to
love
they
do
not
give
themselves
and
that
the
conquest
of
one
of
them
would
prove
a
harder
matter
than
the
conquest
of
europe
madame
returned
armand
i
have
not
time
to
wait
i
am
a
spoilt
child
as
you
told
me
yourself
when
i
seriously
resolve
to
have
that
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
i
shall
have
you
will
have
it
queried
she
and
there
was
a
trace
of
surprise
in
her
loftiness
i
shall
have
oh
you
would
do
me
a
great
pleasure
by
resolving
to
have
it
for
curiosity
s
sake
i
should
be
delighted
to
know
how
you
would
set
about
it
i
am
delighted
to
put
a
new
interest
into
your
life
interrupted
montriveau
breaking
into
a
laugh
which
dismayed
the
duchess
will
you
permit
me
to
take
you
to
the
ball
tonight
a
thousand
thanks
de
marsay
has
been
beforehand
with
you
i
gave
him
my
montriveau
bowed
gravely
and
went
so
ronquerolles
was
right
thought
he
and
now
for
a
game
of
thenceforward
he
hid
his
agitation
by
complete
composure
no
man
is
strong
enough
to
bear
such
sudden
alternations
from
the
height
of
happiness
to
the
depths
of
wretchedness
so
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
happy
life
the
better
to
feel
the
emptiness
of
his
previous
existence
there
was
a
terrible
storm
within
him
but
he
had
learned
to
endure
and
bore
the
shock
of
tumultuous
thoughts
as
a
granite
cliff
stands
out
against
the
surge
of
an
angry
sea
i
could
say
nothing
when
i
am
with
her
my
wits
desert
me
she
does
not
know
how
vile
and
contemptible
she
is
nobody
has
ventured
to
bring
her
face
to
face
with
herself
she
has
played
with
many
a
man
no
doubt
i
will
avenge
them
for
the
first
time
it
may
be
in
a
man
s
heart
revenge
and
love
were
blended
so
equally
that
montriveau
himself
could
not
know
whether
love
or
revenge
would
carry
all
before
it
that
very
evening
he
went
to
the
ball
at
which
he
was
sure
of
seeing
the
duchesse
de
langeais
and
almost
despaired
of
reaching
her
heart
he
inclined
to
think
that
there
was
something
diabolical
about
this
woman
who
was
gracious
to
him
and
radiant
with
charming
smiles
probably
because
she
had
no
wish
to
allow
the
world
to
think
that
she
had
compromised
herself
with
de
montriveau
coolness
on
both
sides
is
a
sign
of
love
but
so
long
as
the
duchess
was
the
same
as
ever
while
the
marquis
looked
sullen
and
morose
was
it
not
plain
that
she
had
conceded
nothing
onlookers
know
the
rejected
lover
by
various
signs
and
tokens
they
never
mistake
the
genuine
symptoms
for
a
coolness
such
as
some
women
command
their
adorers
to
feign
in
the
hope
of
concealing
their
love
everyone
laughed
at
montriveau
and
he
having
omitted
to
consult
his
cornac
was
abstracted
and
ill
at
ease
de
ronquerolles
would
very
likely
have
bidden
him
compromise
the
duchess
by
responding
to
her
show
of
friendliness
by
passionate
demonstrations
but
as
it
was
armand
de
montriveau
came
away
from
the
ball
loathing
human
nature
and
even
then
scarcely
ready
to
believe
in
such
complete
depravity
if
there
is
no
executioner
for
such
crimes
he
said
as
he
looked
up
at
the
lighted
windows
of
the
ballroom
where
the
most
enchanting
women
in
paris
were
dancing
laughing
and
chatting
i
will
take
you
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
mme
la
duchesse
and
make
you
feel
something
that
bites
more
deeply
than
the
knife
in
the
place
de
la
greve
steel
against
steel
we
shall
see
which
heart
will
leave
the
deeper
for
a
week
or
so
mme
de
langeais
hoped
to
see
the
marquis
de
montriveau
again
but
he
contented
himself
with
sending
his
card
every
morning
to
the
hotel
de
langeais
the
duchess
could
not
help
shuddering
each
time
that
the
card
was
brought
in
and
a
dim
foreboding
crossed
her
mind
but
the
thought
was
vague
as
a
presentiment
of
disaster
when
her
eyes
fell
on
the
name
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
felt
the
touch
of
the
implacable
man
s
strong
hand
in
her
hair
sometimes
the
words
seemed
like
a
prognostication
of
a
vengeance
which
her
lively
intellect
invented
in
the
most
shocking
forms
she
had
studied
him
too
well
not
to
dread
him
would
he
murder
her
she
wondered
would
that
man
dash
out
her
vitals
by
flinging
her
over
his
head
would
he
trample
her
body
under
his
feet
when
where
and
how
would
he
get
her
into
his
power
would
he
make
her
suffer
very
much
and
what
kind
of
pain
would
he
inflict
she
repented
of
her
conduct
there
were
hours
when
if
he
had
come
she
would
have
gone
to
his
arms
in
complete
every
night
before
she
slept
she
saw
montriveau
s
face
every
night
it
wore
a
different
aspect
sometimes
she
saw
his
bitter
smile
sometimes
the
jovelike
knitting
of
the
brows
or
his
leonine
look
or
some
disdainful
movement
of
the
shoulders
made
him
terrible
for
her
next
day
the
card
seemed
stained
with
blood
the
name
of
montriveau
stirred
her
now
as
the
presence
of
the
fiery
stubborn
exacting
lover
had
never
done
her
apprehensions
gathered
strength
in
the
silence
she
was
forced
without
aid
from
without
to
face
the
thought
of
a
hideous
duel
of
which
she
could
not
speak
her
proud
hard
nature
was
more
responsive
to
thrills
of
hate
than
it
had
ever
been
to
the
caresses
of
love
ah
if
the
general
could
but
have
seen
her
as
she
sat
with
her
forehead
drawn
into
folds
between
her
brows
immersed
in
bitter
thoughts
in
that
boudoir
where
he
had
enjoyed
such
happy
moments
he
might
perhaps
have
conceived
high
hopes
of
all
human
passions
is
not
pride
alone
incapable
of
engendering
anything
base
mme
de
langeais
kept
her
thoughts
to
herself
but
is
it
not
permissible
to
suppose
that
de
montriveau
was
no
longer
indifferent
to
her
and
has
not
a
man
gained
ground
immensely
when
a
woman
thinks
about
him
he
is
bound
to
make
progress
with
her
either
one
way
or
the
other
afterwards
put
any
feminine
creature
under
the
feet
of
a
furious
horse
or
other
fearsome
beast
she
will
certainly
drop
on
her
knees
and
look
for
death
but
if
the
brute
shows
a
milder
mood
and
does
not
utterly
slay
her
she
will
love
the
horse
lion
bull
or
what
not
and
will
speak
of
him
quite
at
her
ease
the
duchess
felt
that
she
was
under
the
lion
s
paws
she
quaked
but
she
did
not
hate
him
the
man
and
woman
thus
singularly
placed
with
regard
to
each
other
met
three
times
in
society
during
the
course
of
that
week
each
time
in
reply
to
coquettish
questioning
glances
the
duchess
received
a
respectful
bow
and
smiles
tinged
with
such
savage
irony
that
all
her
apprehensions
over
the
card
in
the
morning
were
revived
at
night
our
lives
are
simply
such
as
our
feelings
shape
them
for
us
and
the
feelings
of
these
two
had
hollowed
out
a
great
gulf
between
them
the
comtesse
de
serizy
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
sister
gave
a
great
ball
at
the
beginning
of
the
following
week
and
mme
de
langeais
was
sure
to
go
to
it
armand
was
the
first
person
whom
the
duchess
saw
when
she
came
into
the
room
and
this
time
armand
was
looking
out
for
her
or
so
she
thought
at
least
the
two
exchanged
a
look
and
suddenly
the
woman
felt
a
cold
perspiration
break
from
every
pore
she
had
thought
all
along
that
montriveau
was
capable
of
taking
reprisals
in
some
way
proportioned
to
their
condition
and
now
the
revenge
had
been
discovered
it
was
ready
heated
and
boiling
lightnings
flashed
from
the
foiled
lover
s
eyes
his
face
was
radiant
with
exultant
vengeance
and
the
duchess
her
eyes
were
haggard
in
spite
of
her
resolution
to
be
cool
and
insolent
she
went
to
take
her
place
beside
the
comtesse
de
serizy
who
could
not
help
exclaiming
dear
antoinette
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
are
enough
to
frighten
i
shall
be
all
right
after
a
quadrille
she
answered
giving
a
hand
to
a
young
man
who
came
up
at
that
moment
mme
de
langeais
waltzed
that
evening
with
a
sort
of
excitement
and
transport
which
redoubled
montriveau
s
lowering
looks
he
stood
in
front
of
the
line
of
spectators
who
were
amusing
themselves
by
looking
on
every
time
that
came
past
him
his
eyes
darted
down
upon
her
eddying
face
he
might
have
been
a
tiger
with
the
prey
in
his
grasp
the
waltz
came
to
an
end
mme
de
langeais
went
back
to
her
place
beside
the
countess
and
montriveau
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
talking
all
the
while
with
a
stranger
one
of
the
things
that
struck
me
most
on
the
journey
he
was
saying
and
the
duchess
listened
with
all
her
ears
was
the
remark
which
the
man
makes
at
westminster
when
you
are
shown
the
axe
with
which
a
man
in
a
mask
cut
off
charles
the
first
s
head
so
they
tell
you
the
king
made
it
first
of
all
to
some
inquisitive
person
and
they
repeat
it
still
in
memory
of
what
does
the
man
say
asked
mme
de
serizy
do
not
touch
the
axe
replied
montriveau
and
there
was
menace
in
the
sound
of
his
voice
really
my
lord
marquis
said
mme
de
langeais
you
tell
this
old
story
that
everybody
knows
if
they
have
been
to
london
and
look
at
my
neck
in
such
a
melodramatic
way
that
you
seem
to
me
to
have
an
axe
in
your
the
duchess
was
in
a
cold
sweat
but
nevertheless
she
laughed
as
she
spoke
the
last
words
but
circumstances
give
the
story
a
quite
new
application
returned
he
how
so
pray
tell
me
for
pity
s
sake
in
this
way
madame
you
have
touched
the
axe
said
montriveau
lowering
his
voice
what
an
enchanting
prophecy
returned
she
smiling
with
assumed
grace
and
when
is
my
head
to
fall
i
have
no
wish
to
see
that
pretty
head
of
yours
cut
off
i
only
fear
some
great
misfortune
for
you
if
your
head
were
clipped
close
would
you
feel
no
regrets
for
the
dainty
golden
hair
that
you
turn
to
such
good
account
there
are
those
for
whom
a
woman
would
love
to
make
such
a
sacrifice
even
if
as
often
happens
it
is
for
the
sake
of
a
man
who
can
not
make
allowances
for
an
outbreak
of
quite
so
well
and
if
some
wag
were
to
spoil
your
beauty
on
a
sudden
by
some
chemical
process
and
you
who
are
but
eighteen
for
us
were
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
why
the
smallpox
is
our
battle
of
waterloo
monsieur
she
interrupted
after
it
is
over
we
find
out
those
who
love
us
would
you
not
regret
the
lovely
face
that
oh
indeed
i
should
but
less
for
my
own
sake
than
for
the
sake
of
someone
else
whose
delight
it
might
have
been
and
after
all
if
i
were
loved
always
loved
and
truly
loved
what
would
my
beauty
matter
to
me
what
do
you
say
clara
it
is
a
dangerous
speculation
replied
mme
de
serizy
is
it
permissible
to
ask
his
majesty
the
king
of
sorcerers
when
i
made
the
mistake
of
touching
the
axe
since
i
have
not
been
to
london
as
yet
he
answered
in
english
with
a
burst
of
ironical
laughter
and
when
will
the
punishment
begin
at
this
montriveau
coolly
took
out
his
watch
and
ascertained
the
hour
with
a
truly
appalling
air
of
conviction
a
dreadful
misfortune
will
befall
you
before
this
day
is
i
am
not
a
child
to
be
easily
frightened
or
rather
i
am
a
child
ignorant
of
danger
said
the
duchess
i
shall
dance
now
without
fear
on
the
edge
of
the
i
am
delighted
to
know
that
you
have
so
much
strength
of
character
he
answered
as
he
watched
her
go
to
take
her
place
in
a
square
dance
but
the
duchess
in
spite
of
her
apparent
contempt
for
armand
s
dark
prophecies
was
really
frightened
her
late
lover
s
presence
weighed
upon
her
morally
and
physically
with
a
sense
of
oppression
that
scarcely
ceased
when
he
left
the
ballroom
and
yet
when
she
had
drawn
freer
breath
and
enjoyed
the
relief
for
a
moment
she
found
herself
regretting
the
sensation
of
dread
so
greedy
of
extreme
sensations
is
the
feminine
nature
the
regret
was
not
love
but
it
was
certainly
akin
to
other
feelings
which
prepare
the
way
for
love
and
then
as
if
the
impression
which
montriveau
had
made
upon
her
were
suddenly
revived
she
recollected
his
air
of
conviction
as
he
took
out
his
watch
and
in
a
sudden
spasm
of
dread
she
went
out
by
this
time
it
was
about
midnight
one
of
her
servants
waiting
with
her
pelisse
went
down
to
order
her
carriage
on
her
way
home
she
fell
naturally
enough
to
musing
over
de
montriveau
s
prediction
arrived
in
her
own
courtyard
as
she
supposed
she
entered
a
vestibule
almost
like
that
of
her
own
hotel
and
suddenly
saw
that
the
staircase
was
different
she
was
in
a
strange
house
turning
to
call
her
servants
she
was
attacked
by
several
men
who
rapidly
flung
a
handkerchief
over
her
mouth
bound
her
hand
and
foot
and
carried
her
off
she
shrieked
aloud
madame
our
orders
are
to
kill
you
if
you
scream
a
voice
said
in
her
ear
so
great
was
the
duchess
s
terror
that
she
could
never
recollect
how
nor
by
whom
she
was
transported
when
she
came
to
herself
she
was
lying
on
a
couch
in
a
bachelor
s
lodging
her
hands
and
feet
tied
with
silken
cords
in
spite
of
herself
she
shrieked
aloud
as
she
looked
round
and
met
armand
de
montriveau
s
eyes
he
was
sitting
in
his
quietly
smoking
a
cigar
in
his
armchair
do
not
cry
out
mme
la
duchesse
he
said
coolly
taking
the
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
i
have
a
headache
besides
i
will
untie
you
but
listen
attentively
to
what
i
have
the
honour
to
say
to
very
carefully
he
untied
the
knots
that
bound
her
feet
what
would
be
the
use
of
calling
out
nobody
can
hear
your
cries
you
are
too
well
bred
to
make
any
unnecessary
fuss
if
you
do
not
stay
quietly
if
you
insist
upon
a
struggle
with
me
i
shall
tie
your
hands
and
feet
again
all
things
considered
i
think
that
you
have
enough
to
stay
on
this
sofa
as
if
you
were
lying
on
your
own
at
home
cold
as
ever
if
you
will
you
have
made
me
shed
many
tears
on
this
couch
tears
that
i
hid
from
all
other
while
montriveau
was
speaking
the
duchess
glanced
about
her
it
was
a
woman
s
glance
a
stolen
look
that
saw
all
things
and
seemed
to
see
nothing
she
was
much
pleased
with
the
room
it
was
rather
like
a
monk
s
cell
the
man
s
character
and
thoughts
seemed
to
pervade
it
no
decoration
of
any
kind
broke
the
grey
painted
surface
of
the
walls
a
green
carpet
covered
the
floor
a
black
sofa
a
table
littered
with
papers
two
big
a
chest
of
drawers
with
an
alarum
clock
by
way
of
ornament
a
very
low
bedstead
with
a
coverlet
flung
over
it
a
red
cloth
with
a
black
key
border
all
these
things
made
part
of
a
whole
that
told
of
a
life
reduced
to
its
simplest
terms
a
triple
of
egyptian
design
on
the
recalled
the
vast
spaces
of
the
desert
and
montriveau
s
long
wanderings
a
huge
stood
out
beneath
the
folds
of
stuff
at
the
and
just
beyond
a
green
curtain
with
a
black
and
scarlet
border
was
suspended
by
large
rings
from
a
spear
handle
above
a
door
near
one
corner
of
the
room
the
other
door
by
which
the
band
had
entered
was
likewise
curtained
but
the
drapery
hung
from
an
ordinary
as
the
duchess
finally
noted
that
the
pattern
was
the
same
on
both
she
saw
that
the
door
at
the
stood
open
gleams
of
ruddy
light
from
the
room
beyond
flickered
below
the
fringed
border
naturally
the
ominous
light
roused
her
curiosity
she
fancied
she
could
distinguish
strange
shapes
in
the
shadows
but
as
it
did
not
occur
to
her
at
the
time
that
danger
could
come
from
that
quarter
she
tried
to
gratify
a
more
ardent
curiosity
monsieur
if
it
is
not
indiscreet
may
i
ask
what
you
mean
to
do
with
me
the
insolence
and
irony
of
the
tone
stung
through
the
words
the
duchess
quite
believed
that
she
read
extravagant
love
in
montriveau
s
speech
he
had
carried
her
off
was
not
that
in
itself
an
acknowledgment
of
her
power
nothing
whatever
madame
he
returned
gracefully
puffing
the
last
whiff
of
cigar
smoke
you
will
remain
here
for
a
short
time
first
of
all
i
should
like
to
explain
to
you
what
you
are
and
what
i
am
i
can
not
put
my
thoughts
into
words
whilst
you
are
twisting
on
the
sofa
in
your
boudoir
and
besides
in
your
own
house
you
take
offence
at
the
slightest
hint
you
ring
the
bell
make
an
outcry
and
turn
your
lover
out
at
the
door
as
if
he
were
the
basest
of
wretches
here
my
mind
is
unfettered
here
nobody
can
turn
me
out
here
you
shall
be
my
victim
for
a
few
seconds
and
you
are
going
to
be
so
exceedingly
kind
as
to
listen
to
me
you
need
fear
nothing
i
did
not
carry
you
off
to
insult
you
nor
yet
to
take
by
force
what
you
refused
to
grant
of
your
own
will
to
my
unworthiness
i
could
not
stoop
so
low
you
possibly
think
of
outrage
for
myself
i
have
no
such
he
flung
his
cigar
coolly
into
the
fire
the
smoke
is
unpleasant
to
you
no
doubt
madame
he
said
and
rising
at
once
he
took
a
from
the
hearth
burnt
perfumes
and
purified
the
air
the
duchess
s
astonishment
was
only
equaled
by
her
humiliation
she
was
in
this
man
s
power
and
he
would
not
abuse
his
power
the
eyes
in
which
love
had
once
blazed
like
flame
were
now
quiet
and
steady
as
stars
she
trembled
her
dread
of
armand
was
increased
by
a
nightmare
sensation
of
restlessness
and
utter
inability
to
move
she
felt
as
if
she
were
turned
to
stone
she
lay
passive
in
the
grip
of
fear
she
thought
she
saw
the
light
behind
the
curtains
grow
to
a
blaze
as
if
blown
up
by
a
pair
of
bellows
in
another
moment
the
gleams
of
flame
grew
brighter
and
she
fancied
that
three
masked
figures
suddenly
flashed
out
but
the
terrible
vision
disappeared
so
swiftly
that
she
took
it
for
an
optical
delusion
madame
armand
continued
with
cold
contempt
one
minute
just
one
minute
is
enough
for
me
and
you
shall
feel
it
afterwards
at
every
moment
throughout
your
lifetime
the
one
eternity
over
which
i
have
power
i
am
not
god
listen
carefully
to
me
he
continued
pausing
to
add
solemnity
to
his
words
love
will
always
come
at
your
call
you
have
boundless
power
over
men
but
remember
that
once
you
called
love
and
love
came
to
you
love
as
pure
and
as
may
be
on
earth
and
as
reverent
as
it
was
passionate
fond
as
a
devoted
woman
s
as
a
mother
s
love
a
love
so
great
indeed
that
it
was
past
the
bounds
of
reason
you
played
with
it
and
you
committed
a
crime
every
woman
has
a
right
to
refuse
herself
to
love
which
she
feels
she
can
not
share
and
if
a
man
loves
and
can
not
win
love
in
return
he
is
not
to
be
pitied
he
has
no
right
to
complain
but
with
a
semblance
of
love
to
attract
an
unfortunate
creature
cut
off
from
all
affection
to
teach
him
to
understand
happiness
to
the
full
only
to
snatch
it
from
him
to
rob
him
of
his
future
of
felicity
to
slay
his
happiness
not
merely
today
but
as
long
as
his
life
lasts
by
poisoning
every
hour
of
it
and
every
thought
this
i
call
a
fearful
crime
monsieur
i
can
not
allow
you
to
answer
me
yet
so
listen
to
me
still
in
any
case
i
have
rights
over
you
but
i
only
choose
to
exercise
one
the
right
of
the
judge
over
the
criminal
so
that
i
may
arouse
your
conscience
if
you
had
no
conscience
left
i
should
not
reproach
you
at
all
but
you
are
so
young
you
must
feel
some
life
still
in
your
heart
or
so
i
like
to
believe
while
i
think
of
you
as
depraved
enough
to
do
a
wrong
which
the
law
does
not
punish
i
do
not
think
you
so
degraded
that
you
can
not
comprehend
the
full
meaning
of
my
words
i
as
he
spoke
the
duchess
heard
the
smothered
sound
of
a
pair
of
bellows
those
mysterious
figures
which
she
had
just
seen
were
blowing
up
the
fire
no
doubt
the
glow
shone
through
the
curtain
but
montriveau
s
lurid
face
was
turned
upon
her
she
could
not
choose
but
wait
with
a
heart
and
eyes
fixed
in
a
stare
however
curious
she
felt
the
heat
in
armand
s
words
interested
her
even
more
than
the
crackling
of
the
mysterious
flames
madame
he
went
on
after
a
pause
if
some
poor
wretch
commits
a
murder
in
paris
it
is
the
executioner
s
duty
you
know
to
lay
hands
on
him
and
stretch
him
on
the
plank
where
murderers
pay
for
their
crimes
with
their
heads
then
the
newspapers
inform
everyone
rich
and
poor
so
that
the
former
are
assured
that
they
may
sleep
in
peace
and
the
latter
are
warned
that
they
must
be
on
the
watch
if
they
would
live
well
you
that
are
religious
and
even
a
little
of
a
bigot
may
have
masses
said
for
such
a
man
s
soul
you
both
belong
to
the
same
family
but
yours
is
the
elder
branch
and
the
elder
branch
may
occupy
high
places
in
peace
and
live
happily
and
without
cares
want
or
anger
may
drive
your
brother
the
convict
to
take
a
man
s
life
you
have
taken
more
you
have
taken
the
joy
out
of
a
man
s
life
you
have
killed
all
that
was
best
in
his
life
his
dearest
beliefs
the
murderer
simply
lay
in
wait
for
his
victim
and
killed
him
reluctantly
and
in
fear
of
the
scaffold
but
you
heaped
up
every
sin
that
weakness
can
commit
against
strength
that
suspected
no
evil
you
tamed
a
passive
victim
the
better
to
gnaw
his
heart
out
you
lured
him
with
caresses
you
left
nothing
undone
that
could
set
him
dreaming
imagining
longing
for
the
bliss
of
love
you
asked
innumerable
sacrifices
of
him
only
to
refuse
to
make
any
in
return
he
should
see
the
light
indeed
before
you
put
out
his
eyes
it
is
wonderful
how
you
found
the
heart
to
do
it
such
villainies
demand
a
display
of
resource
quite
above
the
comprehension
of
those
bourgeoises
whom
you
laugh
at
and
despise
they
can
give
and
forgive
they
know
how
to
love
and
suffer
the
grandeur
of
their
devotion
dwarfs
us
rising
higher
in
the
social
scale
one
finds
just
as
much
mud
as
at
the
lower
end
but
with
this
difference
at
the
upper
end
it
is
hard
and
gilded
over
yes
to
find
baseness
in
perfection
you
must
look
for
a
noble
bringing
up
a
great
name
a
fair
woman
a
duchess
you
can
not
fall
lower
than
the
lowest
unless
you
are
set
high
above
the
rest
of
the
i
express
my
thoughts
badly
the
wounds
you
dealt
me
are
too
painful
as
yet
but
do
not
think
that
i
complain
my
words
are
not
the
expression
of
any
hope
for
myself
there
is
no
trace
of
bitterness
in
them
know
this
madame
for
a
certainty
i
forgive
you
my
forgiveness
is
so
complete
that
you
need
not
feel
in
the
least
sorry
that
you
came
hither
to
find
it
against
your
will
but
you
might
take
advantage
of
other
hearts
as
as
my
own
and
it
is
my
duty
to
spare
them
anguish
so
you
have
inspired
the
thought
of
justice
expiate
your
sin
here
on
earth
god
may
perhaps
forgive
you
i
wish
that
he
may
but
he
is
inexorable
and
will
the
woman
looked
up
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
why
do
you
cry
be
true
to
your
nature
you
could
look
on
indifferently
at
the
torture
of
a
heart
as
you
broke
it
that
will
do
madame
do
not
cry
i
can
not
bear
it
any
longer
other
men
will
tell
you
that
you
have
given
them
life
as
for
myself
i
tell
you
with
rapture
that
you
have
given
me
blank
extinction
perhaps
you
guess
that
i
am
not
my
own
that
i
am
bound
to
live
for
my
friends
that
from
this
time
forth
i
must
endure
the
cold
chill
of
death
as
well
as
the
burden
of
life
is
it
possible
that
there
can
be
so
much
kindness
in
you
are
you
like
the
desert
tigress
that
licks
the
wounds
she
has
inflicted
the
duchess
burst
out
sobbing
pray
spare
your
tears
madame
if
i
believed
in
them
at
all
it
would
merely
set
me
on
my
guard
is
this
another
of
your
artifices
or
is
it
not
you
have
used
so
many
with
me
how
can
one
think
that
there
is
any
truth
in
you
nothing
that
you
do
or
say
has
any
power
now
to
move
me
that
is
all
i
have
to
mme
de
langeais
rose
to
her
feet
with
a
great
dignity
and
humility
in
her
bearing
you
are
right
to
treat
me
very
hardly
she
said
holding
out
a
hand
to
the
man
who
did
not
take
it
you
have
not
spoken
hardly
enough
and
i
deserve
this
punish
you
madame
a
man
must
love
still
to
punish
must
he
not
from
me
you
must
expect
no
feeling
nothing
resembling
it
if
i
chose
i
might
be
accuser
and
judge
in
my
cause
and
pronounce
and
carry
out
the
sentence
but
i
am
about
to
fulfil
a
duty
not
a
desire
of
vengeance
of
any
kind
the
cruelest
revenge
of
all
i
think
is
scorn
of
revenge
when
it
is
in
our
power
to
take
it
perhaps
i
shall
be
the
minister
of
your
pleasures
who
knows
perhaps
from
this
time
forth
as
you
gracefully
wear
the
tokens
of
disgrace
by
which
society
marks
out
the
criminal
you
may
perforce
learn
something
of
the
convict
s
sense
of
honour
and
then
you
will
love
the
duchess
sat
listening
her
meekness
was
unfeigned
it
was
no
coquettish
device
when
she
spoke
at
last
it
was
after
a
silence
armand
she
began
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
resisted
love
i
was
obeying
all
the
instincts
of
woman
s
modesty
i
should
not
have
looked
for
such
reproaches
from
i
was
weak
you
have
turned
all
my
weaknesses
against
me
and
made
so
many
crimes
of
them
how
could
you
fail
to
understand
that
the
curiosity
of
love
might
have
carried
me
further
than
i
ought
to
go
and
that
next
morning
i
might
be
angry
with
myself
and
wretched
because
i
had
gone
too
far
alas
i
sinned
in
ignorance
i
was
as
sincere
in
my
wrongdoing
i
swear
to
you
as
in
my
remorse
there
was
far
more
love
for
you
in
my
severity
than
in
my
concessions
and
besides
of
what
do
you
complain
i
gave
you
my
heart
that
was
not
enough
you
demanded
brutally
that
i
should
give
my
person
brutally
repeated
montriveau
but
to
himself
he
said
if
i
once
allow
her
to
dispute
over
words
i
am
yes
you
came
to
me
as
if
i
were
one
of
those
women
you
showed
none
of
the
respect
none
of
the
attentions
of
love
had
i
not
reason
to
reflect
very
well
i
reflected
the
unseemliness
of
your
conduct
is
not
inexcusable
love
lay
at
the
source
of
it
let
me
think
so
and
justify
you
to
well
armand
this
evening
even
while
you
were
prophesying
evil
i
felt
convinced
that
there
was
happiness
in
store
for
us
both
yes
i
put
my
faith
in
the
noble
proud
nature
so
often
tested
and
she
bent
lower
and
i
was
yours
wholly
she
murmured
in
his
ear
i
felt
a
longing
that
i
can
not
express
to
give
happiness
to
a
man
so
violently
tried
by
adversity
if
i
must
have
a
master
my
master
should
be
a
great
man
as
i
felt
conscious
of
my
height
the
less
i
cared
to
descend
i
felt
i
could
trust
you
i
saw
a
whole
lifetime
of
love
while
you
were
pointing
to
death
strength
and
kindness
always
go
together
my
friend
you
are
so
strong
you
will
not
be
unkind
to
a
helpless
woman
who
loves
you
if
i
was
wrong
is
there
no
way
of
obtaining
forgiveness
no
way
of
making
reparation
repentance
is
the
charm
of
love
i
should
like
to
be
very
charming
for
you
how
could
i
alone
among
women
fail
to
know
a
woman
s
doubts
and
fears
the
timidity
that
it
is
so
natural
to
feel
when
you
bind
yourself
for
life
and
know
how
easily
a
man
snaps
such
ties
the
bourgeoises
with
whom
you
compared
me
just
now
give
themselves
but
they
struggle
first
very
well
i
struggled
but
here
i
am
ah
god
he
does
not
hear
me
she
broke
off
and
wringing
her
hands
she
cried
out
but
i
love
you
i
am
yours
and
fell
at
armand
s
feet
yours
yours
my
one
and
only
master
armand
tried
to
raise
her
madame
it
is
too
late
antoinette
can
not
save
the
duchesse
de
langeais
i
can
not
believe
in
either
today
you
may
give
yourself
tomorrow
you
may
refuse
no
power
in
earth
or
heaven
can
insure
me
the
sweet
constancy
of
love
all
love
s
pledges
lay
in
the
past
and
now
nothing
of
that
past
the
light
behind
the
curtain
blazed
up
so
brightly
that
the
duchess
could
not
help
turning
her
head
this
time
she
distinctly
saw
the
three
masked
figures
armand
she
said
i
would
not
wish
to
think
ill
of
you
why
are
those
men
there
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
me
those
men
will
be
as
silent
as
i
myself
with
regard
to
the
thing
which
is
about
to
be
done
think
of
them
simply
as
my
hands
and
my
heart
one
of
them
is
a
surgeon
a
surgeon
armand
my
friend
of
all
things
suspense
is
the
hardest
to
bear
just
speak
tell
me
if
you
wish
for
my
life
i
will
give
it
to
you
you
shall
not
take
it
then
you
did
not
understand
me
did
i
not
speak
just
now
of
justice
to
put
an
end
to
your
misapprehensions
continued
he
taking
up
a
small
steel
object
from
the
table
i
will
now
explain
what
i
have
decided
with
regard
to
he
held
out
a
lorraine
cross
fastened
to
the
tip
of
a
steel
rod
two
of
my
friends
at
this
very
moment
are
heating
another
cross
made
on
this
pattern
we
are
going
to
stamp
it
upon
your
forehead
here
between
the
eyes
so
that
there
will
be
no
possibility
of
hiding
the
mark
with
diamonds
and
so
avoiding
people
s
questions
in
short
you
shall
bear
on
your
forehead
the
brand
of
infamy
which
your
brothers
the
convicts
wear
on
their
shoulders
the
pain
is
a
mere
trifle
but
i
feared
a
nervous
crisis
of
some
kind
of
resistance
resistance
she
cried
clapping
her
hands
for
joy
oh
no
no
i
would
have
the
whole
world
here
to
see
ah
my
armand
brand
her
quickly
this
creature
of
yours
brand
her
with
your
mark
as
a
poor
little
trifle
belonging
to
you
you
asked
for
pledges
of
my
love
here
they
are
all
in
one
ah
for
me
there
is
nothing
but
mercy
and
forgiveness
and
eternal
happiness
in
this
revenge
of
yours
when
you
have
marked
this
woman
with
your
mark
when
you
set
your
crimson
brand
on
her
your
slave
in
soul
you
can
never
afterwards
abandon
her
you
will
be
mine
for
evermore
when
you
cut
me
off
from
my
kind
you
make
yourself
responsible
for
my
happiness
or
you
prove
yourself
base
and
i
know
that
you
are
noble
and
great
why
when
a
woman
loves
the
brand
of
love
is
burnt
into
her
soul
by
her
own
come
in
gentlemen
come
in
and
brand
her
this
duchesse
de
langeais
she
is
de
montriveau
s
forever
ah
come
quickly
all
of
you
my
forehead
burns
hotter
than
your
fire
armand
turned
his
head
sharply
away
lest
he
should
see
the
duchess
kneeling
quivering
with
the
throbbings
of
her
heart
he
said
some
word
and
his
three
friends
vanished
the
women
of
paris
salons
know
how
one
mirror
reflects
another
the
duchess
with
every
motive
for
reading
the
depths
of
armand
s
heart
was
all
eyes
and
armand
all
unsuspicious
of
the
mirror
brushed
away
two
tears
as
they
fell
her
whole
future
lay
in
those
two
tears
when
he
turned
round
again
to
help
her
to
rise
she
was
standing
before
him
sure
of
love
her
pulses
must
have
throbbed
fast
when
he
spoke
with
the
firmness
she
had
known
so
well
how
to
use
of
old
while
she
played
with
him
i
spare
you
madame
all
that
has
taken
place
shall
be
as
if
it
had
never
been
you
may
believe
me
but
now
let
us
bid
each
other
goodbye
i
like
to
think
that
you
were
sincere
in
your
coquetries
on
your
sofa
sincere
again
in
this
outpouring
of
your
heart
i
feel
that
there
is
no
faith
in
you
left
in
me
you
would
torment
me
again
you
would
always
be
the
duchess
and
but
there
we
shall
never
understand
each
other
now
what
do
you
wish
he
continued
taking
the
tone
of
a
master
of
the
ceremonies
to
return
home
or
to
go
back
to
mme
de
serizy
s
ball
i
have
done
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
any
scandal
neither
your
servants
nor
anyone
else
can
possibly
know
what
has
passed
between
us
in
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
your
servants
have
no
idea
that
you
have
left
the
ballroom
your
carriage
never
left
mme
de
serizy
s
courtyard
your
brougham
may
likewise
be
found
in
the
court
of
your
own
hotel
where
do
you
wish
to
be
what
do
you
counsel
armand
there
is
no
armand
now
mme
la
duchesse
we
are
strangers
to
each
then
take
me
to
the
ball
she
said
still
curious
to
put
armand
s
power
to
the
test
thrust
a
soul
that
suffered
in
the
world
and
must
always
suffer
there
if
there
is
no
happiness
for
her
now
down
into
hell
again
and
yet
oh
my
friend
i
love
you
as
your
bourgeoises
love
i
love
you
so
that
i
could
come
to
you
and
fling
my
arms
about
your
neck
before
all
the
world
if
you
asked
it
off
me
the
hateful
world
has
not
corrupted
me
i
am
young
at
least
and
i
have
grown
younger
still
i
am
a
child
yes
your
child
your
new
creature
ah
do
not
drive
me
forth
out
of
my
eden
armand
shook
his
head
ah
let
me
take
something
with
me
if
i
go
some
little
thing
to
wear
tonight
on
my
heart
she
said
taking
possession
of
armand
s
glove
which
she
twisted
into
her
handkerchief
no
i
am
like
all
those
depraved
women
you
do
not
know
the
world
and
so
you
can
not
know
my
worth
you
shall
know
it
now
there
are
women
who
sell
themselves
for
money
there
are
others
to
be
gained
by
gifts
it
is
a
vile
world
oh
i
wish
i
were
a
simple
bourgeoise
a
working
girl
if
you
would
rather
have
a
woman
beneath
you
than
a
woman
whose
devotion
is
accompanied
by
high
rank
as
men
count
it
oh
my
armand
there
are
noble
high
and
chaste
and
pure
natures
among
us
and
then
they
are
lovely
indeed
i
would
have
all
nobleness
that
i
might
offer
it
all
up
to
you
misfortune
willed
that
i
should
be
a
duchess
i
would
i
were
a
royal
princess
that
my
offering
might
be
complete
i
would
be
a
grisette
for
you
and
a
queen
for
everyone
he
listened
damping
his
cigars
with
his
lips
you
will
let
me
know
when
you
wish
to
go
he
said
but
i
should
like
to
stay
that
is
another
matter
stay
that
was
badly
rolled
she
cried
seizing
on
a
cigar
and
devouring
all
that
armand
s
lips
had
touched
do
you
smoke
oh
what
would
i
not
do
to
please
you
very
well
go
i
will
obey
you
she
answered
with
tears
in
her
eyes
you
must
be
blindfolded
you
must
not
see
a
glimpse
of
the
i
am
ready
armand
she
said
bandaging
her
eyes
can
you
see
noiselessly
he
knelt
before
her
ah
i
can
hear
you
she
cried
with
a
little
fond
gesture
thinking
that
the
pretence
of
harshness
was
over
he
made
as
if
he
would
kiss
her
lips
she
held
up
her
face
you
can
see
i
am
just
a
little
bit
so
you
always
deceive
me
ah
take
off
this
handkerchief
sir
she
cried
out
with
the
passion
of
a
great
generosity
repelled
with
scorn
lead
me
i
will
not
open
my
armand
felt
sure
of
her
after
that
cry
he
led
the
way
the
duchess
nobly
true
to
her
word
was
blind
but
while
montriveau
held
her
hand
as
a
father
might
and
led
her
up
and
down
flights
of
stairs
he
was
studying
the
throbbing
pulses
of
this
woman
s
heart
so
suddenly
invaded
by
love
mme
de
langeais
rejoicing
in
this
power
of
speech
was
glad
to
let
him
know
all
but
he
was
inflexible
his
hand
was
passive
in
reply
to
the
questionings
of
her
hand
at
length
after
some
journey
made
together
armand
bade
her
go
forward
the
opening
was
doubtless
narrow
for
as
she
went
she
felt
that
his
hand
protected
her
dress
his
care
touched
her
it
was
a
revelation
surely
that
there
was
a
little
love
still
left
yet
it
was
in
some
sort
a
farewell
for
montriveau
left
her
without
a
word
the
air
was
warm
the
duchess
feeling
the
heat
opened
her
eyes
and
found
herself
standing
by
the
fire
in
the
comtesse
de
serizy
s
boudoir
she
was
alone
her
first
thought
was
for
her
disordered
toilette
in
a
moment
she
had
adjusted
her
dress
and
restored
her
picturesque
coiffure
well
dear
antoinette
we
have
been
looking
for
you
it
was
the
comtesse
de
serizy
who
spoke
as
she
opened
the
door
i
came
here
to
breathe
said
the
duchess
it
is
unbearably
hot
in
the
people
thought
that
you
had
gone
but
my
brother
ronquerolles
told
me
that
your
servants
were
waiting
for
i
am
tired
out
dear
let
me
stay
and
rest
here
for
a
minute
and
the
duchess
sat
down
on
the
sofa
why
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
are
shaking
from
head
to
foot
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
came
in
mme
la
duchesse
i
was
afraid
that
something
might
have
happened
i
have
just
come
across
your
coachman
the
man
is
as
tipsy
as
all
the
swiss
in
the
duchess
made
no
answer
she
was
looking
round
the
room
at
the
and
the
tall
mirrors
seeking
the
trace
of
an
opening
then
with
an
extraordinary
sensation
she
recollected
that
she
was
again
in
the
midst
of
the
gaiety
of
the
ballroom
after
that
terrific
scene
which
had
changed
the
whole
course
of
her
life
she
began
to
shiver
violently
m
de
montriveau
s
prophecy
has
shaken
my
nerves
she
said
it
was
a
joke
but
still
i
will
see
whether
his
axe
from
london
will
haunt
me
even
in
my
sleep
so
le
as
she
went
through
the
rooms
she
was
beset
with
inquiries
and
regrets
her
world
seemed
to
have
dwindled
now
that
she
its
queen
had
fallen
so
low
was
so
diminished
and
what
moreover
were
these
men
compared
with
him
whom
she
loved
with
all
her
heart
with
the
man
grown
great
by
all
that
she
had
lost
in
stature
the
giant
had
regained
the
height
that
he
had
lost
for
a
while
and
she
exaggerated
it
perhaps
beyond
measure
she
looked
in
spite
of
herself
at
the
servant
who
had
attended
her
to
the
ball
he
was
fast
asleep
have
you
been
here
all
the
time
she
asked
yes
as
she
took
her
seat
in
her
carriage
she
saw
in
fact
that
her
coachman
was
drunk
so
drunk
that
at
any
other
time
she
would
have
been
afraid
but
after
a
great
crisis
in
life
fear
loses
its
appetite
for
common
food
she
reached
home
at
any
rate
without
accident
but
even
there
she
felt
a
change
in
herself
a
new
feeling
that
she
could
not
shake
off
for
her
there
was
now
but
one
man
in
the
world
which
is
to
say
that
henceforth
she
cared
to
shine
for
his
sake
alone
while
the
physiologist
can
define
love
promptly
by
following
out
natural
laws
the
moralist
finds
a
far
more
perplexing
problem
before
him
if
he
attempts
to
consider
love
in
all
its
developments
due
to
social
conditions
still
in
spite
of
the
heresies
of
the
endless
sects
that
divide
the
church
of
love
there
is
one
broad
and
trenchant
line
of
difference
in
doctrine
a
line
that
all
the
discussion
in
the
world
can
never
deflect
a
rigid
application
of
this
line
explains
the
nature
of
the
crisis
through
which
the
duchess
like
most
women
was
to
pass
passion
she
knew
but
she
did
not
love
as
yet
love
and
passion
are
two
different
conditions
which
poets
and
men
of
the
world
philosophers
and
fools
alike
continually
confound
love
implies
a
give
and
take
a
certainty
of
bliss
that
nothing
can
change
it
means
so
close
a
clinging
of
the
heart
and
an
exchange
of
happiness
so
constant
that
there
is
no
room
left
for
jealousy
then
possession
is
a
means
and
not
an
end
unfaithfulness
may
give
pain
but
the
bond
is
not
less
close
the
soul
is
neither
more
nor
less
ardent
or
troubled
but
happy
at
every
moment
in
short
the
divine
breath
of
desire
spreading
from
end
to
end
of
the
immensity
of
time
steeps
it
all
for
us
in
the
selfsame
hue
life
takes
the
tint
of
the
unclouded
heaven
but
passion
is
the
foreshadowing
of
love
and
of
that
infinite
to
which
all
suffering
souls
aspire
passion
is
a
hope
that
may
be
cheated
passion
means
both
suffering
and
transition
passion
dies
out
when
hope
is
dead
men
and
women
may
pass
through
this
experience
many
times
without
dishonor
for
it
is
so
natural
to
spring
towards
happiness
but
there
is
only
one
love
in
a
lifetime
all
discussions
of
sentiment
ever
conducted
on
paper
or
by
word
of
mouth
may
therefore
be
resumed
by
two
questions
is
it
passion
is
it
love
so
since
love
comes
into
existence
only
through
the
intimate
experience
of
the
bliss
which
gives
it
lasting
life
the
duchess
was
beneath
the
yoke
of
passion
as
yet
and
as
she
knew
the
fierce
tumult
the
unconscious
calculations
the
fevered
cravings
and
all
that
is
meant
by
that
word
she
suffered
through
all
the
trouble
of
her
soul
there
rose
eddying
gusts
of
tempest
raised
by
vanity
or
or
pride
or
a
high
spirit
for
all
these
forms
of
egoism
make
common
cause
together
she
had
said
to
this
man
i
love
you
i
am
yours
was
it
possible
that
the
duchesse
de
langeais
should
have
uttered
those
words
in
vain
she
must
either
be
loved
now
or
play
her
part
of
queen
no
longer
and
then
she
felt
the
loneliness
of
the
luxurious
couch
where
pleasure
had
never
yet
set
his
glowing
feet
and
over
and
over
again
while
she
tossed
and
writhed
there
she
said
i
want
to
be
but
the
belief
that
she
still
had
in
herself
gave
her
hope
of
success
the
duchess
might
be
piqued
the
vain
parisienne
might
be
humiliated
but
the
woman
saw
glimpses
of
wedded
happiness
and
imagination
avenging
the
time
lost
for
nature
took
a
delight
in
kindling
the
inextinguishable
fire
in
her
veins
she
all
but
attained
to
the
sensations
of
love
for
amid
her
poignant
doubt
whether
she
was
loved
in
return
she
felt
glad
at
heart
to
say
to
herself
i
love
him
as
for
her
scruples
religion
and
the
world
she
could
trample
them
under
foot
montriveau
was
her
religion
now
she
spent
the
next
day
in
a
state
of
moral
torpor
troubled
by
a
physical
unrest
which
no
words
could
express
she
wrote
letters
and
tore
them
all
up
and
invented
a
thousand
impossible
fancies
when
de
montriveau
s
usual
hour
arrived
she
tried
to
think
that
he
would
come
and
enjoyed
the
feeling
of
expectation
her
whole
life
was
concentrated
in
the
single
sense
of
hearing
sometimes
she
shut
her
eyes
straining
her
ears
to
listen
through
space
wishing
that
she
could
annihilate
everything
that
lay
between
her
and
her
lover
and
so
establish
that
perfect
silence
which
sounds
may
traverse
from
afar
in
her
tense
the
ticking
of
the
clock
grew
hateful
to
her
she
stopped
its
garrulity
the
twelve
strokes
of
midnight
sounded
from
the
ah
god
she
cried
to
see
him
here
would
be
happiness
and
yet
it
is
not
so
very
long
since
he
came
here
brought
by
desire
and
the
tones
of
his
voice
filled
this
boudoir
and
now
there
is
she
remembered
the
times
that
she
had
played
the
coquette
with
him
and
how
that
her
coquetry
had
cost
her
her
lover
and
the
despairing
tears
flowed
for
long
her
woman
came
at
length
with
mme
la
duchesse
does
not
know
perhaps
that
it
is
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
thought
that
madame
was
not
feeling
yes
i
am
going
to
bed
said
the
duchess
drying
her
eyes
but
remember
suzanne
never
to
come
in
again
without
orders
i
tell
you
this
for
the
last
for
a
week
mme
de
langeais
went
to
every
house
where
there
was
a
hope
of
meeting
de
montriveau
contrary
to
her
usual
habits
she
came
early
and
went
late
gave
up
dancing
and
went
to
the
her
experiments
were
fruitless
she
did
not
succeed
in
getting
a
glimpse
of
armand
she
did
not
dare
to
utter
his
name
now
one
evening
however
in
a
fit
of
despair
she
spoke
to
mme
de
serizy
and
asked
as
carelessly
as
she
could
you
must
have
quarreled
with
de
montriveau
he
is
not
to
be
seen
at
your
house
the
countess
laughed
so
he
does
not
come
here
either
she
returned
he
is
not
to
be
seen
anywhere
for
that
matter
he
is
interested
in
some
woman
no
i
used
to
think
that
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
was
one
of
his
friends
the
duchess
began
sweetly
i
have
never
heard
my
brother
say
that
he
was
acquainted
with
mme
de
langeais
did
not
reply
mme
de
serizy
concluded
from
the
duchess
s
silence
that
she
might
apply
the
scourge
with
impunity
to
a
discreet
friendship
which
she
had
seen
with
bitterness
of
soul
for
a
long
time
past
so
you
miss
that
melancholy
personage
do
you
i
have
heard
most
extraordinary
things
of
him
wound
his
feelings
he
never
comes
back
he
forgives
nothing
and
if
you
love
him
he
keeps
you
in
chains
to
everything
that
i
said
of
him
one
of
those
that
praise
him
would
always
answer
he
knows
how
to
love
people
are
always
telling
me
that
montriveau
would
give
up
all
for
his
friend
that
his
is
a
great
nature
pooh
society
does
not
want
such
tremendous
natures
men
of
that
stamp
are
all
very
well
at
home
let
them
stay
there
and
leave
us
to
our
pleasant
littlenesses
what
do
you
say
antoinette
woman
of
the
world
though
she
was
the
duchess
seemed
agitated
yet
she
replied
in
a
natural
voice
that
deceived
her
fair
friend
i
am
sorry
to
miss
him
i
took
a
great
interest
in
him
and
promised
to
myself
to
be
his
sincere
friend
i
like
great
natures
dear
friend
ridiculous
though
you
may
think
it
to
give
oneself
to
a
fool
is
a
clear
confession
is
it
not
that
one
is
governed
wholly
by
one
s
senses
mme
de
serizy
s
preferences
had
always
been
for
commonplace
men
her
lover
at
the
moment
the
marquis
d
aiglemont
was
a
fine
tall
man
after
this
the
countess
soon
took
her
departure
you
may
be
sure
mme
de
langeais
saw
hope
in
armand
s
withdrawal
from
the
world
she
wrote
to
him
at
once
it
was
a
humble
gentle
letter
surely
it
would
bring
him
if
he
loved
her
still
she
sent
her
footman
with
it
next
day
on
the
servant
s
return
she
asked
whether
he
had
given
the
letter
to
de
montriveau
himself
and
could
not
restrain
the
movement
of
joy
at
the
affirmative
answer
armand
was
in
paris
he
stayed
alone
in
his
house
he
did
not
go
out
into
society
so
she
was
loved
all
day
long
she
waited
for
an
answer
that
never
came
again
and
again
when
impatience
grew
unbearable
antoinette
found
reasons
for
his
delay
armand
felt
embarrassed
the
reply
would
come
by
post
but
night
came
and
she
could
not
deceive
herself
any
longer
it
was
a
dreadful
day
a
day
of
pain
grown
sweet
of
intolerable
a
day
when
the
heart
squanders
the
very
forces
of
life
in
riot
next
day
she
sent
for
an
answer
m
le
marquis
sent
word
that
he
would
call
on
mme
la
duchesse
reported
julien
she
fled
lest
her
happiness
should
be
seen
in
her
face
and
flung
herself
on
her
couch
to
devour
her
first
sensations
he
is
coming
the
thought
rent
her
soul
and
in
truth
woe
unto
those
for
whom
suspense
is
not
the
most
horrible
time
of
tempest
while
it
increases
and
multiplies
the
sweetest
joys
for
they
have
nothing
in
them
of
that
flame
which
quickens
the
images
of
things
giving
to
them
a
second
existence
so
that
we
cling
as
closely
to
the
pure
essence
as
to
its
outward
and
visible
manifestation
what
is
suspense
in
love
but
a
constant
drawing
upon
an
unfailing
hope
a
submission
to
the
terrible
scourging
of
passion
while
passion
is
yet
happy
and
the
disenchantment
of
reality
has
not
set
in
the
constant
putting
forth
of
strength
and
longing
called
suspense
is
surely
to
the
human
soul
as
fragrance
to
the
flower
that
breathes
it
forth
we
soon
leave
the
brilliant
unsatisfying
colours
of
tulips
and
coreopsis
but
we
turn
again
and
again
to
drink
in
the
sweetness
of
or
compared
separately
each
in
its
own
land
to
a
betrothed
bride
full
of
love
made
fair
by
the
past
and
future
the
duchess
learned
the
joys
of
this
new
life
of
hers
through
the
rapture
with
which
she
received
the
scourgings
of
love
as
this
change
wrought
in
her
she
saw
other
destinies
before
her
and
a
better
meaning
in
the
things
of
life
as
she
hurried
to
her
she
understood
what
studied
adornment
and
the
most
minute
attention
to
her
toilet
mean
when
these
are
undertaken
for
love
s
sake
and
not
for
vanity
even
now
this
making
ready
helped
her
to
bear
the
long
time
of
waiting
a
relapse
of
intense
agitation
set
in
when
she
was
dressed
she
passed
through
nervous
paroxysms
brought
on
by
the
dreadful
power
which
sets
the
whole
mind
in
ferment
perhaps
that
power
is
only
a
disease
though
the
pain
of
it
is
sweet
the
duchess
was
dressed
and
waiting
at
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
at
eleven
that
night
de
montriveau
had
not
arrived
to
try
to
give
an
idea
of
the
anguish
endured
by
a
woman
who
might
be
said
to
be
the
spoilt
child
of
civilization
would
be
to
attempt
to
say
how
many
imaginings
the
heart
can
condense
into
one
thought
as
well
endeavour
to
measure
the
forces
expended
by
the
soul
in
a
sigh
whenever
the
bell
rang
to
estimate
the
drain
of
life
when
a
carriage
rolled
past
without
stopping
and
left
her
prostrate
can
he
be
playing
with
me
she
said
as
the
clocks
struck
midnight
she
grew
white
her
teeth
chattered
she
struck
her
hands
together
and
leapt
up
and
crossed
the
boudoir
recollecting
as
she
did
so
how
often
he
had
come
thither
without
a
summons
but
she
resigned
herself
had
she
not
seen
him
grow
pale
and
start
up
under
the
stinging
barbs
of
irony
then
mme
de
langeais
felt
the
horror
of
the
woman
s
appointed
lot
a
man
s
is
the
active
part
a
woman
must
wait
passively
when
she
loves
if
a
woman
goes
beyond
her
beloved
she
makes
a
mistake
which
few
men
can
forgive
almost
every
man
would
feel
that
a
woman
lowers
herself
by
this
piece
of
angelic
flattery
but
armand
s
was
a
great
nature
he
surely
must
be
one
of
the
very
few
who
can
repay
such
exceeding
love
by
love
that
lasts
forever
well
i
will
make
the
advance
she
told
herself
as
she
tossed
on
her
bed
and
found
no
sleep
there
i
will
go
to
him
i
will
not
weary
myself
with
holding
out
a
hand
to
him
but
i
will
hold
it
out
a
man
of
a
thousand
will
see
a
promise
of
love
and
constancy
in
every
step
that
a
woman
takes
towards
him
yes
the
angels
must
come
down
from
heaven
to
reach
men
and
i
wish
to
be
an
angel
for
next
day
she
wrote
it
was
a
billet
of
the
kind
in
which
the
intellects
of
the
ten
thousand
sevignes
that
paris
now
can
number
particularly
excel
and
yet
only
a
duchesse
de
langeais
brought
up
by
mme
la
princesse
de
could
have
written
that
delicious
note
no
other
woman
could
complain
without
lowering
herself
could
spread
wings
in
such
a
flight
without
draggling
her
pinions
in
humiliation
rise
gracefully
in
revolt
scold
without
giving
offence
and
pardon
without
compromising
her
personal
dignity
julien
went
with
the
note
julien
like
his
kind
was
the
victim
of
love
s
marches
and
countermarches
what
did
de
montriveau
reply
she
asked
as
indifferently
as
she
could
when
the
man
came
back
to
report
himself
m
le
marquis
requested
me
to
tell
mme
la
duchesse
that
it
was
all
oh
the
dreadful
reaction
of
the
soul
upon
herself
to
have
her
heart
stretched
on
the
rack
before
curious
witnesses
yet
not
to
utter
a
sound
to
be
forced
to
keep
silence
one
of
the
countless
miseries
of
the
rich
more
than
three
weeks
went
by
mme
de
langeais
wrote
again
and
again
and
no
answer
came
from
montriveau
at
last
she
gave
out
that
she
was
ill
to
gain
a
dispensation
from
attendance
on
the
princess
and
from
social
duties
she
was
only
at
home
to
her
father
the
duc
de
navarreins
her
aunt
the
princesse
de
the
old
vidame
de
pamiers
her
maternal
and
to
her
husband
s
uncle
the
duc
de
grandlieu
these
persons
found
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
the
duchess
was
ill
seeing
that
she
grew
thinner
and
paler
and
more
dejected
every
day
the
vague
ardour
of
love
the
smart
of
wounded
pride
the
continual
prick
of
the
only
scorn
that
could
touch
her
the
yearnings
towards
joys
that
she
craved
with
a
vain
continual
longing
all
these
things
told
upon
her
mind
and
body
all
the
forces
of
her
nature
were
stimulated
to
no
purpose
she
was
paying
the
arrears
of
her
life
of
she
went
out
at
last
to
a
review
de
montriveau
was
to
be
there
for
the
duchess
on
the
balcony
of
the
tuileries
with
the
royal
family
it
was
one
of
those
festival
days
that
are
long
remembered
she
looked
supremely
beautiful
in
her
languor
she
was
greeted
with
admiration
in
all
eyes
it
was
montriveau
s
presence
that
made
her
so
fair
once
or
twice
they
exchanged
glances
the
general
came
almost
to
her
feet
in
all
the
glory
of
that
soldier
s
uniform
which
produces
an
effect
upon
the
feminine
imagination
to
which
the
most
prudish
will
confess
when
a
woman
is
very
much
in
love
and
has
not
seen
her
lover
for
two
months
such
a
swift
moment
must
be
something
like
the
phase
of
a
dream
when
the
eyes
embrace
a
world
that
stretches
away
forever
only
women
or
young
men
can
imagine
the
dull
frenzied
hunger
in
the
duchess
s
eyes
as
for
older
men
if
during
the
paroxysms
of
early
passion
in
youth
they
had
experience
of
such
phenomena
of
nervous
power
at
a
later
day
it
is
so
completely
forgotten
that
they
deny
the
very
existence
of
the
luxuriant
ecstasy
the
only
name
that
can
be
given
to
these
wonderful
intuitions
religious
ecstasy
is
the
aberration
of
a
soul
that
has
shaken
off
its
bonds
of
flesh
whereas
in
amorous
ecstasy
all
the
forces
of
soul
and
body
are
embraced
and
blended
in
one
if
a
woman
falls
a
victim
to
the
tyrannous
frenzy
before
which
mme
de
langeais
was
forced
to
bend
she
will
take
one
decisive
resolution
after
another
so
swiftly
that
it
is
impossible
to
give
account
of
them
thought
after
thought
rises
and
flits
across
her
brain
as
clouds
are
whirled
by
the
wind
across
the
grey
veil
of
mist
that
shuts
out
the
sun
thenceforth
the
facts
reveal
all
and
the
facts
are
these
the
day
after
the
review
mme
de
langeais
sent
her
carriage
and
liveried
servants
to
wait
at
the
marquis
de
montriveau
s
door
from
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
till
three
in
the
afternoon
armand
lived
in
the
rue
de
tournon
a
few
steps
away
from
the
chamber
of
peers
and
that
very
day
the
house
was
sitting
but
long
before
the
peers
returned
to
their
palaces
several
people
had
recognised
the
duchess
s
carriage
and
liveries
the
first
of
these
was
the
baron
de
maulincour
that
young
officer
had
met
with
disdain
from
mme
de
langeais
and
a
better
reception
from
mme
de
serizy
he
betook
himself
at
once
therefore
to
his
mistress
and
under
seal
of
secrecy
told
her
of
this
strange
freak
in
a
moment
the
news
was
spread
with
telegraphic
speed
through
all
the
coteries
in
the
faubourg
it
reached
the
tuileries
and
the
it
was
the
sensation
of
the
day
the
matter
of
all
the
talk
from
noon
till
night
almost
everywhere
the
women
denied
the
facts
but
in
such
a
manner
that
the
report
was
confirmed
the
men
one
and
all
believed
it
and
manifested
a
most
indulgent
interest
in
mme
de
langeais
some
among
them
threw
the
blame
on
armand
that
savage
of
a
montriveau
is
a
man
of
bronze
said
they
he
insisted
on
making
this
scandal
no
very
well
then
others
replied
mme
de
langeais
has
been
guilty
of
a
most
generous
piece
of
imprudence
to
renounce
the
world
and
rank
and
fortune
and
consideration
for
her
lover
s
sake
and
that
in
the
face
of
all
paris
is
as
fine
a
d
for
a
woman
as
that
barber
s
which
so
affected
canning
in
a
court
of
assize
not
one
of
the
women
who
blame
the
duchess
would
make
a
declaration
worthy
of
ancient
times
it
is
heroic
of
mme
de
langeais
to
proclaim
herself
so
frankly
now
there
is
nothing
left
to
her
but
to
love
montriveau
there
must
be
something
great
about
a
woman
if
she
says
i
will
have
but
one
but
what
is
to
become
of
society
monsieur
if
you
honour
vice
in
this
way
without
respect
for
virtue
asked
the
comtesse
de
granville
the
s
wife
while
the
chateau
the
faubourg
and
the
chaussee
d
antin
were
discussing
the
shipwreck
of
aristocratic
virtue
while
excited
young
men
rushed
about
on
horseback
to
make
sure
that
the
carriage
was
standing
in
the
rue
de
tournon
and
the
duchess
in
consequence
was
beyond
a
doubt
in
de
montriveau
s
rooms
mme
de
langeais
with
heavy
throbbing
pulses
was
lying
hidden
away
in
her
boudoir
and
armand
he
had
been
out
all
night
and
at
that
moment
was
walking
with
de
marsay
in
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
the
elder
members
of
mme
de
langeais
family
were
engaged
in
calling
upon
one
another
arranging
to
read
her
a
homily
and
to
hold
a
consultation
as
to
the
best
way
of
putting
a
stop
to
the
scandal
at
three
o
clock
therefore
le
duc
de
navarreins
the
vidame
de
pamiers
the
old
princesse
de
and
the
duc
de
grandlieu
were
assembled
in
mme
la
duchesse
de
langeais
to
them
as
to
all
curious
inquirers
the
servants
said
that
their
mistress
was
not
at
home
the
duchess
had
made
no
exceptions
to
her
orders
but
these
four
personages
shone
conspicuous
in
that
lofty
sphere
of
which
the
revolutions
and
hereditary
pretensions
are
solemnly
recorded
year
by
year
in
the
de
wherefore
without
some
slight
sketch
of
each
of
them
this
picture
of
society
were
incomplete
the
princesse
de
in
the
feminine
world
was
a
most
poetic
wreck
of
the
reign
of
louis
quinze
in
her
beautiful
prime
so
it
was
said
she
had
done
her
part
to
win
for
that
monarch
his
appellation
of
of
her
past
charms
of
feature
little
remained
save
a
remarkably
prominent
slender
nose
curved
like
a
turkish
scimitar
now
the
principal
ornament
of
a
countenance
that
put
you
in
mind
of
an
old
white
glove
add
a
few
powdered
curls
pantoufles
a
cap
with
upstanding
loops
of
lace
black
mittens
and
a
decided
taste
for
but
to
do
full
justice
to
the
lady
it
must
be
said
that
she
appeared
in
gowns
of
an
evening
so
high
an
opinion
of
her
ruins
had
she
wore
long
gloves
and
raddled
her
cheeks
with
martin
s
classic
rouge
an
appalling
amiability
in
her
wrinkles
a
prodigious
brightness
in
the
old
lady
s
eyes
a
profound
dignity
in
her
whole
person
together
with
the
triple
barbed
wit
of
her
tongue
and
an
infallible
memory
in
her
head
made
of
her
a
real
power
in
the
land
the
whole
cabinet
des
chartes
was
entered
in
duplicate
on
the
parchment
of
her
brain
she
knew
all
the
genealogies
of
every
noble
house
in
europe
princes
dukes
and
counts
and
could
put
her
hand
on
the
last
descendants
of
charlemagne
in
the
direct
line
no
usurpation
of
title
could
escape
the
princesse
de
young
men
who
wished
to
stand
well
at
court
ambitious
men
and
young
married
women
paid
her
assiduous
homage
her
salon
set
the
tone
of
the
faubourg
the
words
of
this
talleyrand
in
petticoats
were
taken
as
final
decrees
people
came
to
consult
her
on
questions
of
etiquette
or
usages
or
to
take
lessons
in
good
taste
and
in
truth
no
other
old
woman
could
put
back
her
in
her
pocket
as
the
princess
could
while
there
was
a
precision
and
a
grace
about
the
movements
of
her
skirts
when
she
sat
down
or
crossed
her
feet
which
drove
the
finest
ladies
of
the
young
generation
to
despair
her
voice
had
remained
in
her
head
during
of
her
lifetime
but
she
could
not
prevent
a
descent
into
the
membranes
of
the
nose
which
lent
to
it
a
peculiar
expressiveness
she
still
retained
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
livres
of
her
great
fortune
for
napoleon
had
generously
returned
her
woods
to
her
so
that
personally
and
in
the
matter
of
possessions
she
was
a
woman
of
no
little
consequence
this
curious
antique
seated
in
a
low
chair
by
the
fireside
was
chatting
with
the
vidame
de
pamiers
a
contemporary
ruin
the
vidame
was
a
big
tall
and
spare
man
a
seigneur
of
the
old
school
and
had
been
a
commander
of
the
order
of
malta
his
neck
had
always
been
so
tightly
compressed
by
a
strangulation
stock
that
his
cheeks
pouched
over
it
a
little
and
he
held
his
head
high
to
many
people
this
would
have
given
an
air
of
but
in
the
vidame
it
was
justified
by
a
voltairean
wit
his
wide
prominent
eyes
seemed
to
see
everything
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
not
much
that
they
had
not
seen
altogether
his
person
was
a
perfect
model
of
aristocratic
outline
slim
and
slender
supple
and
agreeable
he
seemed
as
if
he
could
be
pliant
or
rigid
at
will
and
twist
and
bend
or
rear
his
head
like
a
snake
the
duc
de
navarreins
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
with
the
duc
de
grandlieu
both
were
men
of
or
thereabouts
and
still
hale
both
were
short
corpulent
flourishing
somewhat
men
with
jaded
eyes
and
lower
lips
that
had
begun
to
hang
already
but
for
an
exquisite
refinement
of
accent
an
urbane
courtesy
and
an
ease
of
manner
that
could
change
in
a
moment
to
insolence
a
superficial
observer
might
have
taken
them
for
a
couple
of
bankers
any
such
mistake
would
have
been
impossible
however
if
the
listener
could
have
heard
them
converse
and
seen
them
on
their
guard
with
men
whom
they
feared
vapid
and
commonplace
with
their
equals
slippery
with
the
inferiors
whom
courtiers
and
statesmen
know
how
to
tame
by
a
tactful
word
or
to
humiliate
with
an
unexpected
phrase
such
were
the
representatives
of
the
great
noblesse
that
determined
to
perish
rather
than
submit
to
any
change
it
was
a
noblesse
that
deserved
praise
and
blame
in
equal
measure
a
noblesse
that
will
never
be
judged
impartially
until
some
poet
shall
arise
to
tell
how
joyfully
the
nobles
obeyed
the
king
though
their
heads
fell
under
a
richelieu
s
axe
and
how
deeply
they
scorned
the
guillotine
of
as
a
foul
revenge
another
noticeable
trait
in
all
the
four
was
a
thin
voice
that
agreed
peculiarly
well
with
their
ideas
and
bearing
among
themselves
at
any
rate
they
were
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
none
of
them
betrayed
any
sign
of
annoyance
over
the
duchess
s
escapade
but
all
of
them
had
learned
at
court
to
hide
their
feelings
and
here
lest
critics
should
condemn
the
puerility
of
the
opening
of
the
forthcoming
scene
it
is
perhaps
as
well
to
remind
the
reader
that
locke
once
happening
to
be
in
the
company
of
several
great
lords
renowned
no
less
for
their
wit
than
for
their
breeding
and
political
consistency
wickedly
amused
himself
by
taking
down
their
conversation
by
some
shorthand
process
of
his
own
and
afterwards
when
he
read
it
over
to
them
to
see
what
they
could
make
of
it
they
all
burst
out
laughing
and
in
truth
the
tinsel
jargon
which
circulates
among
the
upper
ranks
in
every
country
yields
mighty
little
gold
to
the
crucible
when
washed
in
the
ashes
of
literature
or
philosophy
in
every
rank
of
society
some
few
parisian
salons
excepted
the
curious
observer
finds
folly
a
constant
quantity
beneath
a
more
or
less
transparent
varnish
conversation
with
any
substance
in
it
is
a
rare
exception
and
boeotianism
is
current
coin
in
every
zone
in
the
higher
regions
they
must
perforce
talk
more
but
to
make
up
for
it
they
think
the
less
thinking
is
a
tiring
exercise
and
the
rich
like
their
lives
to
flow
by
easily
and
without
effort
it
is
by
comparing
the
fundamental
matter
of
jests
as
you
rise
in
the
social
scale
from
the
to
the
peer
of
france
that
the
observer
arrives
at
a
true
comprehension
of
de
talleyrand
s
maxim
the
manner
is
everything
an
elegant
rendering
of
the
legal
axiom
the
form
is
of
more
consequence
than
the
in
the
eyes
of
the
poet
the
advantage
rests
with
the
lower
classes
for
they
seldom
fail
to
give
a
certain
character
of
rude
poetry
to
their
thoughts
perhaps
also
this
same
observation
may
explain
the
sterility
of
the
salons
their
emptiness
their
shallowness
and
the
repugnance
felt
by
men
of
ability
for
bartering
their
ideas
for
such
pitiful
small
change
the
duke
suddenly
stopped
as
if
some
bright
idea
occurred
to
him
and
remarked
to
his
neighbour
so
you
have
sold
tornthon
no
he
is
ill
i
am
very
much
afraid
i
shall
lose
him
and
i
should
be
uncommonly
sorry
he
is
a
very
good
hunter
do
you
know
how
the
duchesse
de
marigny
is
no
i
did
not
go
this
morning
i
was
just
going
out
to
call
when
you
came
in
to
speak
about
antoinette
but
yesterday
she
was
very
ill
indeed
they
had
given
her
up
she
took
the
her
death
will
make
a
change
in
your
cousin
s
not
at
all
she
gave
away
her
property
in
her
lifetime
only
keeping
an
annuity
she
made
over
the
guebriant
estate
to
her
niece
mme
de
soulanges
subject
to
a
yearly
it
will
be
a
great
loss
for
society
she
was
a
kind
woman
her
family
will
miss
her
her
experience
and
advice
carried
weight
her
son
marigny
is
an
amiable
man
he
has
a
sharp
wit
he
can
talk
he
is
pleasant
very
pleasant
pleasant
oh
that
no
one
can
deny
but
ill
regulated
to
the
last
degree
well
and
yet
it
is
an
extraordinary
thing
he
is
very
acute
he
was
dining
at
the
club
the
other
day
with
that
moneyed
antin
set
your
uncle
he
always
goes
there
for
his
game
of
cards
found
him
there
to
his
astonishment
and
asked
if
he
was
a
member
yes
said
he
i
don
t
go
into
society
now
i
am
living
among
the
you
know
why
added
the
marquis
with
a
meaning
smile
no
said
the
duke
he
is
smitten
with
that
little
mme
keller
gondreville
s
daughter
she
is
only
lately
married
and
has
a
great
vogue
they
say
in
that
well
antoinette
does
not
find
time
heavy
on
her
hands
it
seems
remarked
the
vidame
my
affection
for
that
little
woman
has
driven
me
to
find
a
singular
pastime
replied
the
princess
as
she
returned
her
to
her
pocket
dear
aunt
i
am
extremely
vexed
said
the
duke
stopping
short
in
his
walk
nobody
but
one
of
bonaparte
s
men
could
ask
such
an
indecorous
thing
of
a
woman
of
fashion
between
ourselves
antoinette
might
have
made
a
better
the
montriveaus
are
a
very
old
family
and
very
well
connected
my
dear
replied
the
princess
they
are
related
to
all
the
noblest
houses
of
burgundy
if
the
dulmen
branch
of
the
arschoot
rivaudoults
should
come
to
an
end
in
galicia
the
montriveaus
would
succeed
to
the
arschoot
title
and
estates
they
inherit
through
their
are
you
sure
i
know
it
better
than
this
montriveau
s
father
did
i
told
him
about
it
i
used
to
see
a
good
deal
of
him
and
chevalier
of
several
orders
though
he
was
he
only
laughed
he
was
an
encyclopaedist
but
his
brother
turned
the
relationship
to
good
account
during
the
emigration
i
have
heard
it
said
that
his
northern
kinsfolk
were
most
kind
in
every
way
yes
to
be
sure
the
comte
de
montriveau
died
at
petersburg
said
the
vidame
i
met
him
there
he
was
a
big
man
with
an
incredible
passion
for
however
many
did
he
eat
asked
the
duc
de
grandlieu
ten
dozen
every
and
did
they
not
disagree
with
him
not
the
least
bit
in
the
why
that
is
extraordinary
had
he
neither
the
stone
nor
gout
nor
any
other
complaint
in
consequence
no
his
health
was
perfectly
good
and
he
died
through
an
by
accident
nature
prompted
him
to
eat
oysters
so
probably
he
required
them
for
up
to
a
certain
point
our
predominant
tastes
are
conditions
of
our
i
am
of
your
opinion
said
the
princess
with
a
smile
madame
you
always
put
a
malicious
construction
on
things
returned
the
marquis
i
only
want
you
to
understand
that
these
remarks
might
leave
a
wrong
impression
on
a
young
woman
s
mind
said
she
and
interrupted
herself
to
exclaim
but
this
niece
this
niece
of
mine
dear
aunt
i
still
refuse
to
believe
that
she
can
have
gone
to
de
montriveau
said
the
duc
de
navarreins
bah
returned
the
princess
what
do
you
think
vidame
asked
the
marquis
if
the
duchess
were
an
artless
simpleton
i
should
think
that
but
when
a
woman
is
in
love
she
becomes
an
artless
simpleton
retorted
the
princess
really
my
poor
vidame
you
must
be
getting
after
all
what
is
to
be
done
asked
the
duke
if
my
dear
niece
is
wise
said
the
princess
she
will
go
to
court
this
evening
fortunately
today
is
monday
and
reception
day
and
you
must
see
that
we
all
rally
round
her
and
give
the
lie
to
this
absurd
rumour
there
are
hundreds
of
ways
of
explaining
things
and
if
the
marquis
de
montriveau
is
a
gentleman
he
will
come
to
our
assistance
we
will
bring
these
children
to
listen
to
reason
but
dear
aunt
it
is
not
easy
to
tell
de
montriveau
the
truth
to
his
face
he
is
one
of
bonaparte
s
pupils
and
he
has
a
position
why
he
is
one
of
the
great
men
of
the
day
he
is
high
up
in
the
guards
and
very
useful
there
he
has
not
a
spark
of
ambition
he
is
just
the
man
to
say
here
is
my
commission
leave
me
in
peace
if
the
king
should
say
a
word
that
he
did
not
then
pray
what
are
his
opinions
very
really
sighed
the
princess
the
king
is
as
he
always
has
been
a
jacobin
under
the
lilies
of
oh
not
quite
so
bad
said
the
vidame
yes
i
have
known
him
for
a
long
while
the
man
that
pointed
out
the
court
to
his
wife
on
the
occasion
of
her
first
state
dinner
in
public
with
these
are
our
people
could
only
be
a
scoundrel
i
can
see
monsieur
exactly
the
same
as
ever
in
the
king
the
bad
brother
who
voted
so
wrongly
in
his
department
of
the
constituent
assembly
was
sure
to
compound
with
the
liberals
and
allow
them
to
argue
and
talk
this
philosophical
cant
will
be
just
as
dangerous
now
for
the
younger
brother
as
it
used
to
be
for
the
elder
this
fat
man
with
the
little
mind
is
amusing
himself
by
creating
difficulties
and
how
his
successor
is
to
get
out
of
them
i
do
not
know
he
holds
his
younger
brother
in
abhorrence
he
would
be
glad
to
think
as
he
lay
dying
he
will
not
reign
very
long
aunt
he
is
the
king
and
i
have
the
honour
to
be
in
his
service
but
does
your
post
take
away
your
right
of
free
speech
my
dear
you
come
of
quite
as
good
a
house
as
the
bourbons
if
the
guises
had
shown
a
little
more
resolution
his
majesty
would
be
a
nobody
at
this
day
it
is
time
i
went
out
of
this
world
the
noblesse
is
dead
yes
it
is
all
over
with
you
my
children
she
continued
looking
as
she
spoke
at
the
vidame
what
has
my
niece
done
that
the
whole
town
should
be
talking
about
her
she
is
in
the
wrong
i
disapprove
of
her
conduct
a
useless
scandal
is
a
blunder
that
is
why
i
still
have
my
doubts
about
this
want
of
regard
for
appearances
i
brought
her
up
and
i
know
that
just
at
that
moment
the
duchess
came
out
of
her
boudoir
she
had
recognised
her
aunt
s
voice
and
heard
the
name
of
montriveau
she
was
still
in
her
loose
and
even
as
she
came
in
de
grandlieu
looking
carelessly
out
of
the
window
saw
his
niece
s
carriage
driving
back
along
the
street
the
duke
took
his
daughter
s
face
in
both
hands
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
so
dear
girl
he
said
you
do
not
know
what
is
going
on
has
anything
extraordinary
happened
father
dear
why
all
paris
believes
that
you
are
with
de
my
dear
antoinette
you
were
at
home
all
the
time
were
you
not
said
the
princess
holding
out
a
hand
which
the
duchess
kissed
with
affectionate
respect
yes
dear
mother
i
was
at
home
all
the
time
and
she
added
as
she
turned
to
greet
the
vidame
and
the
marquis
i
wished
that
all
paris
should
think
that
i
was
with
de
the
duke
flung
up
his
hands
struck
them
together
in
despair
and
folded
his
arms
then
can
not
you
see
what
will
come
of
this
mad
freak
he
asked
at
last
but
the
aged
princess
had
suddenly
risen
and
stood
looking
steadily
at
the
duchess
the
younger
woman
flushed
and
her
eyes
fell
mme
de
chauvry
gently
drew
her
closer
and
said
my
little
angel
let
me
kiss
you
she
kissed
her
niece
very
affectionately
on
the
forehead
and
continued
smiling
while
she
held
her
hand
in
a
tight
clasp
we
are
not
under
the
valois
now
dear
child
you
have
compromised
your
husband
and
your
position
still
we
will
arrange
to
make
everything
but
dear
aunt
i
do
not
wish
to
make
it
right
at
all
it
is
my
wish
that
all
paris
should
say
that
i
was
with
de
montriveau
this
morning
if
you
destroy
that
belief
however
ill
grounded
it
may
be
you
will
do
me
a
singular
do
you
really
wish
to
ruin
yourself
child
and
to
grieve
your
family
my
family
father
unintentionally
condemned
me
to
irreparable
misfortune
when
they
sacrificed
me
to
family
considerations
you
may
perhaps
blame
me
for
seeking
alleviations
but
you
will
certainly
feel
for
after
all
the
endless
pains
you
take
to
settle
your
daughters
suitably
muttered
de
navarreins
addressing
the
vidame
the
princess
shook
a
stray
grain
of
snuff
from
her
skirts
my
dear
little
girl
she
said
be
happy
if
you
can
we
are
not
talking
of
troubling
your
felicity
but
of
reconciling
it
with
social
usages
we
all
of
us
here
assembled
know
that
marriage
is
a
defective
institution
tempered
by
love
but
when
you
take
a
lover
is
there
any
need
to
make
your
bed
in
the
place
du
carrousel
see
now
just
be
a
bit
reasonable
and
hear
what
we
have
to
i
am
mme
la
duchesse
began
the
duc
de
grandlieu
if
it
were
any
part
of
an
uncle
s
duty
to
look
after
his
nieces
he
ought
to
have
a
position
society
would
owe
him
honours
and
rewards
and
a
salary
exactly
as
if
he
were
in
the
king
s
service
so
i
am
not
here
to
talk
about
my
nephew
but
of
your
own
interests
let
us
look
ahead
a
little
if
you
persist
in
making
a
scandal
i
have
seen
the
animal
before
and
i
own
that
i
have
no
great
liking
for
him
langeais
is
stingy
enough
and
he
does
not
care
a
rap
for
anyone
but
himself
he
will
have
a
separation
he
will
stick
to
your
money
and
leave
you
poor
and
consequently
you
will
be
a
nobody
the
income
of
a
hundred
thousand
livres
that
you
have
just
inherited
from
your
maternal
will
go
to
pay
for
his
mistresses
amusements
you
will
be
bound
and
gagged
by
the
law
you
will
have
to
say
to
all
these
arrangements
suppose
de
montriveau
leaves
you
dear
me
do
not
let
us
put
ourselves
in
a
passion
my
dear
niece
a
man
does
not
leave
a
woman
while
she
is
young
and
pretty
still
we
have
seen
so
many
pretty
women
left
disconsolate
even
among
princesses
that
you
will
permit
the
supposition
an
all
but
impossible
supposition
i
quite
wish
to
well
suppose
that
he
goes
what
will
become
of
you
without
a
husband
keep
well
with
your
husband
as
you
take
care
of
your
beauty
for
beauty
after
all
is
a
woman
s
parachute
and
a
husband
also
stands
between
you
and
worse
i
am
supposing
that
you
are
happy
and
loved
to
the
end
and
i
am
leaving
unpleasant
or
unfortunate
events
altogether
out
of
the
reckoning
this
being
so
fortunately
or
unfortunately
you
may
have
children
what
are
they
to
be
montriveaus
very
well
they
certainly
will
not
succeed
to
their
father
s
whole
fortune
you
will
want
to
give
them
all
that
you
have
he
will
wish
to
do
the
same
nothing
more
natural
dear
me
and
you
will
find
the
law
against
you
how
many
times
have
we
seen
bringing
a
to
recover
the
property
from
illegitimate
children
every
court
of
law
rings
with
such
actions
all
over
the
world
you
will
create
a
perhaps
and
if
the
trustee
betrays
your
confidence
your
children
have
no
remedy
against
him
and
they
are
ruined
so
choose
carefully
you
see
the
perplexities
of
the
position
in
every
possible
way
your
children
will
be
sacrificed
of
necessity
to
the
fancies
of
your
heart
they
will
have
no
recognised
status
while
they
are
little
they
will
be
charming
but
lord
some
day
they
will
reproach
you
for
thinking
of
no
one
but
your
two
selves
we
old
gentlemen
know
all
about
it
little
boys
grow
up
into
men
and
men
are
ungrateful
beings
when
i
was
in
germany
did
i
not
hear
young
de
horn
say
after
supper
if
my
mother
had
been
an
honest
woman
i
should
be
we
have
spent
our
lives
in
hearing
plebeians
say
brought
about
the
revolution
when
a
man
can
not
lay
the
blame
on
his
father
or
mother
he
holds
god
responsible
for
his
hard
lot
in
short
dear
child
we
are
here
to
open
your
eyes
i
will
say
all
i
have
to
say
in
a
few
words
on
which
you
had
better
meditate
a
woman
ought
never
to
put
her
husband
in
the
uncle
so
long
as
i
cared
for
nobody
i
could
calculate
i
looked
at
interests
then
as
you
do
now
i
can
only
but
my
dear
little
girl
remonstrated
the
vidame
life
is
simply
a
complication
of
interests
and
feelings
to
be
happy
more
particularly
in
your
position
one
must
try
to
reconcile
one
s
feelings
with
one
s
interests
a
grisette
may
love
according
to
her
fancy
that
is
intelligible
enough
but
you
have
a
pretty
fortune
a
family
a
name
and
a
place
at
court
and
you
ought
not
to
fling
them
out
of
the
window
and
what
have
we
been
asking
you
to
do
to
keep
them
all
to
manoeuvre
carefully
instead
of
falling
foul
of
social
conventions
lord
i
shall
very
soon
be
eighty
years
old
and
i
can
not
recollect
under
any
regime
a
love
worth
the
price
that
you
are
willing
to
pay
for
the
love
of
this
lucky
young
the
duchess
silenced
the
vidame
with
a
look
if
montriveau
could
have
seen
that
glance
he
would
have
forgiven
all
it
would
be
very
effective
on
the
stage
remarked
the
duc
de
grandlieu
but
it
all
amounts
to
nothing
when
your
jointure
and
position
and
independence
is
concerned
you
are
not
grateful
my
dear
niece
you
will
not
find
many
families
where
the
relatives
have
courage
enough
to
teach
the
wisdom
gained
by
experience
and
to
make
rash
young
heads
listen
to
reason
renounce
your
salvation
in
two
minutes
if
it
pleases
you
to
damn
yourself
well
and
good
but
reflect
well
beforehand
when
it
comes
to
renouncing
your
income
i
know
of
no
confessor
who
remits
the
pains
of
poverty
i
have
a
right
i
think
to
speak
in
this
way
to
you
for
if
you
are
ruined
i
am
the
one
person
who
can
offer
you
a
refuge
i
am
almost
an
uncle
to
langeais
and
i
alone
have
a
right
to
put
him
in
the
the
duc
de
navarreins
roused
himself
from
painful
reflections
since
you
speak
of
feeling
my
child
he
said
let
me
remind
you
that
a
woman
who
bears
your
name
ought
to
be
moved
by
sentiments
which
do
not
touch
ordinary
people
can
you
wish
to
give
an
advantage
to
the
liberals
to
those
jesuits
of
robespierre
s
that
are
doing
all
they
can
to
vilify
the
noblesse
some
things
a
navarreins
can
not
do
without
failing
in
duty
to
his
house
you
would
not
be
alone
in
your
dishonor
come
come
said
the
princess
dishonor
do
not
make
such
a
fuss
about
the
journey
of
an
empty
carriage
children
and
leave
me
alone
with
antoinette
all
three
of
you
come
and
dine
with
me
i
will
undertake
to
arrange
matters
suitably
you
men
understand
nothing
you
are
beginning
to
talk
sourly
already
and
i
have
no
wish
to
see
a
quarrel
between
you
and
my
dear
child
do
me
the
pleasure
to
the
three
gentlemen
probably
guessed
the
princess
s
intentions
they
took
their
leave
de
navarreins
kissed
his
daughter
on
the
forehead
with
come
be
good
dear
child
it
is
not
too
late
yet
if
you
couldn
t
we
find
some
good
fellow
in
the
family
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
this
montriveau
said
the
vidame
as
they
went
downstairs
when
the
two
women
were
alone
the
princess
beckoned
her
niece
to
a
little
low
chair
by
her
side
my
pearl
said
she
in
this
world
below
i
know
nothing
worse
calumniated
than
god
and
the
eighteenth
century
for
as
i
look
back
over
my
own
young
days
i
do
not
recollect
that
a
single
duchess
trampled
the
proprieties
underfoot
as
you
have
just
done
novelists
and
scribblers
brought
the
reign
of
louis
xv
into
disrepute
do
not
believe
them
the
du
barry
my
dear
was
quite
as
good
as
the
widow
scarron
and
the
more
agreeable
woman
of
the
two
in
my
time
a
woman
could
keep
her
dignity
among
her
gallantries
indiscretion
was
the
ruin
of
us
and
the
beginning
of
all
the
mischief
the
philosophists
the
nobodies
whom
we
admitted
into
our
salons
had
no
more
gratitude
or
sense
of
decency
than
to
make
an
inventory
of
our
hearts
to
traduce
us
one
and
all
and
to
rail
against
the
age
by
way
of
a
return
for
our
kindness
the
people
are
not
in
a
position
to
judge
of
anything
whatsoever
they
looked
at
the
facts
not
at
the
form
but
the
men
and
women
of
those
times
my
heart
were
quite
as
remarkable
as
at
any
other
period
of
the
monarchy
not
one
of
your
werthers
none
of
your
notabilities
as
they
are
called
never
a
one
of
your
men
in
yellow
kid
gloves
and
trousers
that
disguise
the
poverty
of
their
legs
would
cross
europe
in
the
dress
of
a
travelling
hawker
to
brave
the
daggers
of
a
duke
of
modena
and
to
shut
himself
up
in
the
of
the
regent
s
daughter
at
the
risk
of
his
life
not
one
of
your
little
consumptive
patients
with
their
tortoiseshell
eyeglasses
would
hide
himself
in
a
closet
for
six
weeks
like
lauzun
to
keep
up
his
mistress
s
courage
while
she
was
lying
in
of
her
child
there
was
more
passion
in
de
jaucourt
s
little
finger
than
in
your
whole
race
of
higglers
that
leave
a
woman
to
better
themselves
elsewhere
just
tell
me
where
to
find
the
page
that
would
be
cut
in
pieces
and
buried
under
the
floorboards
for
one
kiss
on
the
konigsmark
s
gloved
finger
really
it
would
seem
today
that
the
roles
are
exchanged
and
women
are
expected
to
show
their
devotion
for
men
these
modern
gentlemen
are
worth
less
and
think
more
of
themselves
believe
me
my
dear
all
these
adventures
that
have
been
made
public
and
now
are
turned
against
our
good
louis
xv
were
kept
quite
secret
at
first
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
pack
of
poetasters
scribblers
and
moralists
who
hung
about
our
and
took
down
their
slanders
our
epoch
would
have
appeared
in
literature
as
a
age
i
am
justifying
the
century
and
not
its
fringe
perhaps
a
hundred
women
of
quality
were
lost
but
for
every
one
the
rogues
set
down
ten
like
the
gazettes
after
a
battle
when
they
count
up
the
losses
of
the
beaten
side
and
in
any
case
i
do
not
know
that
the
revolution
and
the
empire
can
reproach
us
they
were
coarse
dull
licentious
times
faugh
it
is
revolting
those
are
the
brothels
of
french
history
this
preamble
my
dear
child
she
continued
after
a
pause
brings
me
to
the
thing
that
i
have
to
say
if
you
care
for
montriveau
you
are
quite
at
liberty
to
love
him
at
your
ease
and
as
much
as
you
can
i
know
by
experience
that
unless
you
are
locked
up
but
locking
people
up
is
out
of
fashion
now
you
will
do
as
you
please
i
should
have
done
the
same
at
your
age
only
sweetheart
i
should
not
have
given
up
my
right
to
be
the
mother
of
future
ducs
de
langeais
so
mind
appearances
the
vidame
is
right
no
man
is
worth
a
single
one
of
the
sacrifices
which
we
are
foolish
enough
to
make
for
their
love
put
yourself
in
such
a
position
that
you
may
still
be
de
langeais
wife
in
case
you
should
have
the
misfortune
to
repent
when
you
are
an
old
woman
you
will
be
very
glad
to
hear
mass
said
at
court
and
not
in
some
provincial
convent
therein
lies
the
whole
question
a
single
imprudence
means
an
allowance
and
a
wandering
life
it
means
that
you
are
at
the
mercy
of
your
lover
it
means
that
you
must
put
up
with
insolence
from
women
that
are
not
so
honest
precisely
because
they
have
been
very
vulgarly
it
would
be
a
hundred
times
better
to
go
to
montriveau
s
at
night
in
a
cab
and
disguised
instead
of
sending
your
carriage
in
broad
daylight
you
are
a
little
fool
my
dear
child
your
carriage
flattered
his
vanity
your
person
would
have
ensnared
his
heart
all
this
that
i
have
said
is
just
and
true
but
for
my
own
part
i
do
not
blame
you
you
are
two
centuries
behind
the
times
with
your
false
ideas
of
greatness
there
leave
us
to
arrange
your
affairs
and
say
that
montriveau
made
your
servants
drunk
to
gratify
his
vanity
and
to
compromise
you
the
duchess
rose
to
her
feet
with
a
spring
in
heaven
s
name
aunt
do
not
slander
him
the
old
princess
s
eyes
flashed
dear
child
she
said
i
should
have
liked
to
spare
such
of
your
illusions
as
were
not
fatal
but
there
must
be
an
end
of
all
illusions
now
you
would
soften
me
if
i
were
not
so
old
come
now
do
not
vex
him
or
us
or
anyone
else
i
will
undertake
to
satisfy
everybody
but
promise
me
not
to
permit
yourself
a
single
step
henceforth
until
you
have
consulted
me
tell
me
all
and
perhaps
i
may
bring
it
all
right
aunt
i
promise
to
tell
me
everything
yes
everything
everything
that
can
be
but
my
sweetheart
it
is
precisely
what
can
not
be
told
that
i
want
to
know
let
us
understand
each
other
thoroughly
come
let
me
put
my
withered
old
lips
on
your
beautiful
forehead
no
let
me
do
as
i
wish
i
forbid
you
to
kiss
my
bones
old
people
have
a
courtesy
of
their
own
there
take
me
down
to
my
carriage
she
added
when
she
had
kissed
her
niece
then
may
i
go
to
him
in
disguise
dear
aunt
why
yes
the
story
can
always
be
denied
said
the
old
princess
this
was
the
one
idea
which
the
duchess
had
clearly
grasped
in
the
sermon
when
mme
de
chauvry
was
seated
in
the
corner
of
her
carriage
mme
de
langeais
bade
her
a
graceful
adieu
and
went
up
to
her
room
she
was
quite
happy
again
my
person
would
have
snared
his
heart
my
aunt
is
right
a
man
can
not
surely
refuse
a
pretty
woman
when
she
understands
how
to
offer
that
evening
at
the
the
duc
de
navarreins
de
pamiers
de
marsay
de
grandlieu
and
the
duc
de
maufrigneuse
triumphantly
refuted
the
scandals
that
were
circulating
with
regard
to
the
duchesse
de
langeais
so
many
officers
and
other
persons
had
seen
montriveau
walking
in
the
tuileries
that
morning
that
the
silly
story
was
set
down
to
chance
which
takes
all
that
is
offered
and
so
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
duchess
s
carriage
had
waited
before
montriveau
s
door
her
character
became
as
clear
and
as
spotless
as
membrino
s
sword
after
sancho
had
polished
it
up
but
at
two
o
clock
de
ronquerolles
passed
montriveau
in
a
deserted
alley
and
said
with
a
smile
she
is
coming
on
is
your
duchess
go
on
keep
it
up
he
added
and
gave
a
significant
cut
of
the
riding
whip
to
his
mare
who
sped
off
like
a
bullet
down
the
avenue
two
days
after
the
fruitless
scandal
mme
de
langeais
wrote
to
de
montriveau
that
letter
like
the
preceding
ones
remained
unanswered
this
time
she
took
her
own
measures
and
bribed
de
montriveau
s
man
auguste
and
so
at
eight
o
clock
that
evening
she
was
introduced
into
armand
s
apartment
it
was
not
the
room
in
which
that
secret
scene
had
passed
it
was
entirely
different
the
duchess
was
told
that
the
general
would
not
be
at
home
that
night
had
he
two
houses
the
man
would
give
no
answer
mme
de
langeais
had
bought
the
key
of
the
room
but
not
the
man
s
whole
loyalty
when
she
was
left
alone
she
saw
her
fourteen
letters
lying
on
an
stand
all
of
them
uncreased
and
unopened
he
had
not
read
them
she
sank
into
an
and
for
a
while
she
lost
consciousness
when
she
came
to
herself
auguste
was
holding
vinegar
for
her
to
inhale
a
carriage
quick
she
ordered
the
carriage
came
she
hastened
downstairs
with
convulsive
speed
and
left
orders
that
no
one
was
to
be
admitted
for
hours
she
lay
in
bed
and
would
have
no
one
near
her
but
her
woman
who
brought
her
a
cup
of
water
from
time
to
time
suzette
heard
her
mistress
moan
once
or
twice
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
tears
in
the
brilliant
eyes
now
circled
with
dark
shadows
the
next
day
amid
despairing
tears
mme
de
langeais
took
her
resolution
her
man
of
business
came
for
an
interview
and
no
doubt
received
instructions
of
some
kind
afterwards
she
sent
for
the
vidame
de
pamiers
and
while
she
waited
she
wrote
a
letter
to
de
montriveau
the
vidame
punctually
came
towards
two
o
clock
that
afternoon
to
find
his
young
cousin
looking
white
and
worn
but
resigned
never
had
her
divine
loveliness
been
more
poetic
than
now
in
the
languor
of
her
agony
you
owe
this
assignation
to
your
years
dear
cousin
she
said
ah
do
not
smile
i
beg
of
you
when
an
unhappy
woman
has
reached
the
lowest
depths
of
wretchedness
you
are
a
gentleman
and
after
the
adventures
of
your
youth
you
must
feel
some
indulgence
for
none
whatever
said
he
indeed
everything
is
in
their
ah
well
you
are
one
of
the
inner
family
circle
possibly
you
will
be
the
last
relative
the
last
friend
whose
hand
i
shall
press
so
i
can
ask
your
good
offices
will
you
dear
vidame
do
me
a
service
which
i
could
not
ask
of
my
own
father
nor
of
my
uncle
grandlieu
nor
of
any
woman
you
can
not
fail
to
understand
i
beg
of
you
to
do
my
bidding
and
then
to
forget
what
you
have
done
whatever
may
come
of
it
it
is
this
will
you
take
this
letter
and
go
to
de
montriveau
will
you
see
him
yourself
give
it
into
his
hands
and
ask
him
as
you
men
can
ask
things
between
yourselves
for
you
have
a
code
of
honour
between
man
and
man
which
you
do
not
use
with
us
and
a
different
way
of
regarding
things
between
yourselves
ask
him
if
he
will
read
this
letter
not
in
your
presence
certain
feelings
men
hide
from
each
other
i
give
you
authority
to
say
if
you
think
it
necessary
to
bring
him
that
it
is
a
question
of
life
or
death
for
me
if
he
deigns
repeated
the
vidame
if
he
deigns
to
read
it
the
duchess
continued
with
dignity
say
one
thing
more
you
will
go
to
see
him
about
five
o
clock
for
i
know
that
he
will
dine
at
home
today
at
that
time
very
good
by
way
of
answer
he
must
come
to
see
me
if
three
hours
afterwards
by
eight
o
clock
he
does
not
leave
his
house
all
will
be
over
the
duchesse
de
langeais
will
have
vanished
from
the
world
i
shall
not
be
dead
dear
friend
no
but
no
human
power
will
ever
find
me
again
on
this
earth
come
and
dine
with
me
i
shall
at
least
have
one
friend
with
me
in
the
last
agony
yes
dear
cousin
tonight
will
decide
my
fate
and
whatever
happens
to
me
i
pass
through
an
ordeal
by
fire
there
not
a
word
i
will
hear
nothing
of
the
nature
of
comment
or
advice
let
us
chat
and
laugh
together
she
added
holding
out
a
hand
which
he
kissed
we
will
be
like
two
philosophers
who
have
learned
how
to
enjoy
life
to
the
last
moment
i
will
look
my
best
i
will
be
very
enchanting
for
you
you
perhaps
will
be
the
last
man
to
set
eyes
on
the
duchesse
de
the
vicomte
bowed
took
the
letter
and
went
without
a
word
at
five
o
clock
he
returned
his
cousin
had
studied
to
please
him
and
she
looked
lovely
indeed
the
room
was
gay
with
flowers
as
if
for
a
festivity
the
dinner
was
exquisite
for
the
vidame
the
duchess
displayed
all
the
brilliancy
of
her
wit
she
was
more
charming
than
she
had
ever
been
before
at
first
the
vidame
tried
to
look
on
all
these
preparations
as
a
young
woman
s
jest
but
now
and
again
the
attempted
illusion
faded
the
spell
of
his
fair
cousin
s
charm
was
broken
he
detected
a
shudder
caused
by
some
kind
of
sudden
dread
and
once
she
seemed
to
listen
during
a
pause
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
hush
she
said
at
seven
o
clock
the
duchess
left
him
for
a
few
minutes
when
she
came
back
again
she
was
dressed
as
her
maid
might
have
dressed
for
a
journey
she
asked
her
guest
to
be
her
escort
took
his
arm
sprang
into
a
hackney
coach
and
by
a
quarter
to
eight
they
stood
outside
de
montriveau
s
door
armand
meantime
had
been
reading
the
following
letter
my
friend
i
went
to
your
rooms
for
a
few
minutes
without
your
knowledge
i
found
my
letters
there
and
took
them
away
this
can
not
be
indifference
armand
between
us
and
hatred
would
show
itself
quite
differently
if
you
love
me
make
an
end
of
this
cruel
play
or
you
will
kill
me
and
afterwards
learning
how
much
you
were
loved
you
might
be
in
despair
if
i
have
not
rightly
understood
you
if
you
have
no
feeling
towards
me
but
aversion
which
implies
both
contempt
and
disgust
then
i
give
up
all
hope
a
man
never
recovers
from
those
feelings
you
will
have
no
regrets
dreadful
though
that
thought
may
be
it
will
comfort
me
in
my
long
sorrow
regrets
oh
my
armand
may
i
never
know
of
them
if
i
thought
that
i
had
caused
you
a
single
regret
but
no
i
will
not
tell
you
what
desolation
i
should
feel
i
should
be
living
still
and
i
could
not
be
your
wife
it
would
be
too
late
now
that
i
have
given
myself
wholly
to
you
in
thought
to
whom
else
should
i
give
myself
to
god
the
eyes
that
you
loved
for
a
little
while
shall
never
look
on
another
man
s
face
and
may
the
glory
of
god
blind
them
to
all
besides
i
shall
never
hear
human
voices
more
since
i
heard
yours
so
gentle
at
the
first
so
terrible
yesterday
for
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
still
only
on
the
morrow
of
your
vengeance
and
now
may
the
will
of
god
consume
me
between
his
wrath
and
yours
my
friend
there
will
be
nothing
left
for
me
but
a
little
space
for
tears
and
prayers
perhaps
you
wonder
why
i
write
to
you
ah
do
not
think
ill
of
me
if
i
keep
a
gleam
of
hope
and
give
one
last
sigh
to
happy
life
before
i
take
leave
of
it
forever
i
am
in
a
hideous
position
i
feel
all
the
inward
serenity
that
comes
when
a
great
resolution
has
been
taken
even
while
i
hear
the
last
growlings
of
the
storm
when
you
went
out
on
that
terrible
adventure
which
so
drew
me
to
you
armand
you
went
from
the
desert
to
the
oasis
with
a
good
guide
to
show
you
the
way
well
i
am
going
out
of
the
oasis
into
the
desert
and
you
are
a
pitiless
guide
to
me
and
yet
you
only
my
friend
can
understand
how
melancholy
it
is
to
look
back
for
the
last
time
on
happiness
to
you
and
you
only
i
can
make
moan
without
a
blush
if
you
grant
my
entreaty
i
shall
be
happy
if
you
are
inexorable
i
shall
expiate
the
wrong
that
i
have
done
after
all
it
is
natural
is
it
not
that
a
woman
should
wish
to
live
invested
with
all
noble
feelings
in
her
friend
s
memory
oh
my
one
and
only
love
let
her
to
whom
you
gave
life
go
down
into
the
tomb
in
the
belief
that
she
is
great
in
your
eyes
your
harshness
led
me
to
reflect
and
now
that
i
love
you
so
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
less
guilty
than
you
think
listen
to
my
justification
i
owe
it
to
you
and
you
that
are
all
the
world
to
me
owe
me
at
least
a
moment
s
justice
i
have
learned
by
my
own
anguish
all
that
i
made
you
suffer
by
my
coquetry
but
in
those
days
i
was
utterly
ignorant
of
love
know
what
the
torture
is
and
you
mete
it
out
to
me
during
those
first
eight
months
that
you
gave
me
you
never
roused
any
feeling
of
love
in
me
do
you
ask
why
this
was
so
my
friend
i
can
no
more
explain
it
than
i
can
tell
you
why
i
love
you
now
oh
certainly
it
flattered
my
vanity
that
i
should
be
the
subject
of
your
passionate
talk
and
receive
those
burning
glances
of
yours
but
you
left
me
cold
no
i
was
not
a
woman
i
had
no
conception
of
womanly
devotion
and
happiness
who
was
to
blame
you
would
have
despised
me
would
you
not
if
i
had
given
myself
without
the
impulse
of
passion
perhaps
it
is
the
highest
height
to
which
we
can
rise
to
give
all
and
receive
no
joy
perhaps
there
is
no
merit
in
yielding
oneself
to
bliss
that
is
foreseen
and
ardently
desired
alas
my
friend
i
can
say
this
now
these
thoughts
came
to
me
when
i
played
with
you
and
you
seemed
to
me
so
great
even
then
that
i
would
not
have
you
owe
the
gift
to
pity
what
is
this
that
i
have
written
i
have
taken
back
all
my
letters
i
am
flinging
them
one
by
one
on
the
fire
they
are
burning
you
will
never
know
what
they
confessed
all
the
love
and
the
passion
and
the
madness
i
will
say
no
more
armand
i
will
stop
i
will
not
say
another
word
of
my
feelings
if
my
prayers
have
not
echoed
from
my
soul
through
yours
i
also
woman
that
i
am
decline
to
owe
your
love
to
your
pity
it
is
my
wish
to
be
loved
because
you
can
not
choose
but
love
me
or
else
to
be
left
without
mercy
if
you
refuse
to
read
this
letter
it
shall
be
burnt
if
after
you
have
read
it
you
do
not
come
to
me
within
three
hours
to
be
henceforth
forever
my
husband
the
one
man
in
the
world
for
me
then
i
shall
never
blush
to
know
that
this
letter
is
in
your
hands
the
pride
of
my
despair
will
protect
my
memory
from
all
insult
and
my
end
shall
be
worthy
of
my
love
when
you
see
me
no
more
on
earth
albeit
i
shall
still
be
alive
you
yourself
will
not
think
without
a
shudder
of
the
woman
who
in
three
hours
time
will
live
only
to
overwhelm
you
with
her
tenderness
a
woman
consumed
by
a
hopeless
love
and
faithful
not
to
memories
of
past
joys
but
to
a
love
that
was
slighted
the
duchesse
de
la
valliere
wept
for
lost
happiness
and
vanished
power
but
the
duchesse
de
langeais
will
be
happy
that
she
may
weep
and
be
a
power
for
you
still
yes
you
will
regret
me
i
see
clearly
that
i
was
not
of
this
world
and
i
thank
you
for
making
it
clear
to
me
farewell
you
will
never
touch
axe
yours
was
the
executioner
s
axe
mine
is
god
s
yours
kills
mine
saves
your
love
was
but
mortal
it
could
not
endure
disdain
or
ridicule
mine
can
endure
all
things
without
growing
weaker
it
will
last
eternally
ah
i
feel
a
sombre
joy
in
crushing
you
that
believe
yourself
so
great
in
humbling
you
with
the
calm
indulgent
smile
of
one
of
the
least
among
the
angels
that
lie
at
the
feet
of
god
for
to
them
is
given
the
right
and
the
power
to
protect
and
watch
over
men
in
his
name
you
have
but
felt
fleeting
desires
while
the
poor
nun
will
shed
the
light
of
her
ceaseless
and
ardent
prayer
about
you
she
will
shelter
you
all
your
life
long
beneath
the
wings
of
a
love
that
has
nothing
of
earth
in
it
i
have
a
presentiment
of
your
answer
our
trysting
place
shall
be
in
heaven
strength
and
weakness
can
both
enter
there
dear
armand
the
strong
and
the
weak
are
bound
to
suffer
this
thought
soothes
the
anguish
of
my
final
ordeal
so
calm
am
i
that
i
should
fear
that
i
had
ceased
to
love
you
if
i
were
not
about
to
leave
the
world
for
your
sake
dear
vidame
said
the
duchess
as
they
reached
montriveau
s
house
do
me
the
kindness
to
ask
at
the
door
whether
he
is
at
the
vidame
obedient
after
the
manner
of
the
eighteenth
century
to
a
woman
s
wish
got
out
and
came
back
to
bring
his
cousin
an
affirmative
answer
that
sent
a
shudder
through
her
she
grasped
his
hand
tightly
in
hers
suffered
him
to
kiss
her
on
either
cheek
and
begged
him
to
go
at
once
he
must
not
watch
her
movements
nor
try
to
protect
her
but
the
people
passing
in
the
street
he
objected
no
one
can
fail
in
respect
to
me
she
said
it
was
the
last
word
spoken
by
the
duchess
and
the
woman
of
fashion
the
vidame
went
mme
de
langeais
wrapped
herself
about
in
her
cloak
and
stood
on
the
doorstep
until
the
clocks
struck
eight
the
last
stroke
died
away
the
unhappy
woman
waited
ten
fifteen
minutes
to
the
last
she
tried
to
see
a
fresh
humiliation
in
the
delay
then
her
faith
ebbed
she
turned
to
leave
the
fatal
threshold
oh
god
the
cry
broke
from
her
in
spite
of
herself
it
was
the
first
word
spoken
by
the
carmelite
montriveau
and
some
of
his
friends
were
talking
together
he
tried
to
hasten
them
to
a
conclusion
but
his
clock
was
slow
and
by
the
time
he
started
out
for
the
hotel
de
langeais
the
duchess
was
hurrying
on
foot
through
the
streets
of
paris
goaded
by
the
dull
rage
in
her
heart
she
reached
the
boulevard
d
enfer
and
looked
out
for
the
last
time
through
falling
tears
on
the
noisy
smoky
city
that
lay
below
in
a
red
mist
lighted
up
by
its
own
lamps
then
she
hailed
a
cab
and
drove
away
never
to
return
when
the
marquis
de
montriveau
reached
the
hotel
de
langeais
and
found
no
trace
of
his
mistress
he
thought
that
he
had
been
duped
he
hurried
away
at
once
to
the
vidame
and
found
that
worthy
gentleman
in
the
act
of
slipping
on
his
flowered
thinking
the
while
of
his
fair
cousin
s
happiness
montriveau
gave
him
one
of
the
terrific
glances
that
produced
the
effect
of
an
electric
shock
on
men
and
women
alike
is
it
possible
that
you
have
lent
yourself
to
some
cruel
hoax
monsieur
montriveau
exclaimed
i
have
just
come
from
mme
de
langeais
house
the
servants
say
that
she
is
then
a
great
misfortune
has
happened
no
doubt
returned
the
vidame
and
through
your
fault
i
left
the
duchess
at
your
door
when
at
a
quarter
to
good
evening
returned
montriveau
and
he
hurried
home
to
ask
the
porter
whether
he
had
seen
a
lady
standing
on
the
doorstep
that
evening
yes
my
lord
marquis
a
handsome
woman
who
seemed
very
much
put
out
she
was
crying
like
a
magdalen
but
she
never
made
a
sound
and
stood
as
upright
as
a
post
then
at
last
she
went
and
my
wife
and
i
that
were
watching
her
while
she
could
not
see
us
heard
her
say
oh
god
so
that
it
went
to
our
hearts
asking
your
pardon
to
hear
her
say
montriveau
in
spite
of
all
his
firmness
turned
pale
at
those
few
words
he
wrote
a
few
lines
to
ronquerolles
sent
off
the
message
at
once
and
went
up
to
his
rooms
ronquerolles
came
just
about
midnight
armand
gave
him
the
duchess
s
letter
to
read
well
asked
ronquerolles
she
was
here
at
my
door
at
eight
o
clock
at
a
eight
she
had
gone
i
have
lost
her
and
i
love
her
oh
if
my
life
were
my
own
i
could
blow
my
brains
pooh
pooh
keep
cool
said
ronquerolles
duchesses
do
not
fly
off
like
wagtails
she
can
not
travel
faster
than
three
leagues
an
hour
and
tomorrow
we
will
ride
confound
it
mme
de
langeais
is
no
ordinary
woman
he
continued
tomorrow
we
will
all
of
us
mount
and
ride
the
police
will
put
us
on
her
track
during
the
day
she
must
have
a
carriage
angels
of
that
sort
have
no
wings
we
shall
find
her
whether
she
is
on
the
road
or
hidden
in
paris
there
is
the
semaphore
we
can
stop
her
you
shall
be
happy
but
my
dear
fellow
you
have
made
a
blunder
of
which
men
of
your
energy
are
very
often
guilty
they
judge
others
by
themselves
and
do
not
know
the
point
when
human
nature
gives
way
if
you
strain
the
cords
too
tightly
why
did
you
not
say
a
word
to
me
sooner
i
would
have
told
you
to
be
punctual
till
tomorrow
he
added
as
montriveau
said
nothing
sleep
if
you
can
he
added
with
a
grasp
of
the
hand
but
the
greatest
resources
which
society
has
ever
placed
at
the
disposal
of
statesmen
kings
ministers
bankers
or
any
human
power
in
fact
were
all
exhausted
in
vain
neither
montriveau
nor
his
friends
could
find
any
trace
of
the
duchess
it
was
clear
that
she
had
entered
a
convent
montriveau
determined
to
search
or
to
institute
a
search
for
her
through
every
convent
in
the
world
he
must
have
her
even
at
the
cost
of
all
the
lives
in
a
town
and
in
justice
to
this
extraordinary
man
it
must
be
said
that
his
frenzied
passion
awoke
to
the
same
ardour
daily
and
lasted
through
five
years
only
in
did
the
duc
de
navarreins
hear
by
chance
that
his
daughter
had
travelled
to
spain
as
lady
julia
hopwood
s
maid
that
she
had
left
her
service
at
cadiz
and
that
lady
julia
never
discovered
that
mlle
caroline
was
the
illustrious
duchess
whose
sudden
disappearance
filled
the
minds
of
the
highest
society
of
paris
the
feelings
of
the
two
lovers
when
they
met
again
on
either
side
of
the
grating
in
the
carmelite
convent
should
now
be
comprehended
to
the
full
and
the
violence
of
the
passion
awakened
in
either
soul
will
doubtless
explain
the
catastrophe
of
the
story
in
the
duc
de
langeais
was
dead
and
his
wife
was
free
antoinette
de
navarreins
was
living
consumed
by
love
on
a
ledge
of
rock
in
the
mediterranean
but
it
was
in
the
pope
s
power
to
dissolve
sister
theresa
s
vows
the
happiness
bought
by
so
much
love
might
yet
bloom
for
the
two
lovers
these
thoughts
sent
montriveau
flying
from
cadiz
to
marseilles
and
from
marseilles
to
paris
a
few
months
after
his
return
to
france
a
merchant
brig
fitted
out
and
munitioned
for
active
service
set
sail
from
the
port
of
marseilles
for
spain
the
vessel
had
been
chartered
by
several
distinguished
men
most
of
them
frenchmen
who
smitten
with
a
romantic
passion
for
the
east
wished
to
make
a
journey
to
those
lands
montriveau
s
familiar
knowledge
of
eastern
customs
made
him
an
invaluable
travelling
companion
and
at
the
entreaty
of
the
rest
he
had
joined
the
expedition
the
minister
of
war
appointed
him
and
put
him
on
the
artillery
commission
to
facilitate
his
departure
hours
later
the
brig
lay
to
off
the
shore
of
an
island
within
sight
of
the
spanish
coast
she
had
been
specially
chosen
for
her
shallow
keel
and
light
mastage
so
that
she
might
lie
at
anchor
in
safety
half
a
league
away
from
the
reefs
that
secure
the
island
from
approach
in
this
direction
if
fishing
vessels
or
the
people
on
the
island
caught
sight
of
the
brig
they
were
scarcely
likely
to
feel
suspicious
of
her
at
once
and
besides
it
was
easy
to
give
a
reason
for
her
presence
without
delay
montriveau
hoisted
the
flag
of
the
united
states
before
they
came
in
sight
of
the
island
and
the
crew
of
the
vessel
were
all
american
sailors
who
spoke
nothing
but
english
one
of
de
montriveau
s
companions
took
the
men
ashore
in
the
ship
s
longboat
and
made
them
so
drunk
at
an
inn
in
the
little
town
that
they
could
not
talk
then
he
gave
out
that
the
brig
was
manned
by
a
gang
of
men
whose
hobby
was
well
known
in
the
united
states
indeed
some
spanish
writer
had
written
a
history
of
them
the
presence
of
the
brig
among
the
reefs
was
now
sufficiently
explained
the
owners
of
the
vessel
according
to
the
boatswain
s
mate
were
looking
for
the
wreck
of
a
galleon
which
foundered
thereabouts
in
with
a
cargo
of
treasure
from
mexico
the
people
at
the
inn
and
the
authorities
asked
no
more
questions
armand
and
the
devoted
friends
who
were
helping
him
in
his
difficult
enterprise
were
all
from
the
first
of
the
opinion
that
there
was
no
hope
of
rescuing
or
carrying
off
sister
theresa
by
force
or
stratagem
from
the
side
of
the
little
town
wherefore
these
bold
spirits
with
one
accord
determined
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
they
would
make
a
way
to
the
convent
at
the
most
seemingly
inaccessible
point
like
general
lamarque
at
the
storming
of
capri
they
would
conquer
nature
the
cliff
at
the
end
of
the
island
a
sheer
block
of
granite
afforded
even
less
hold
than
the
rock
of
capri
so
it
seemed
at
least
to
montriveau
who
had
taken
part
in
that
incredible
exploit
while
the
nuns
in
his
eyes
were
much
more
redoubtable
than
sir
hudson
lowe
to
raise
a
hubbub
over
carrying
off
the
duchess
would
cover
them
with
confusion
they
might
as
well
set
siege
to
the
town
and
convent
like
pirates
and
leave
not
a
single
soul
to
tell
of
their
victory
so
for
them
their
expedition
wore
but
two
aspects
there
should
be
a
conflagration
and
a
feat
of
arms
that
should
dismay
all
europe
while
the
motives
of
the
crime
remained
unknown
or
on
the
other
hand
a
mysterious
aerial
descent
which
should
persuade
the
nuns
that
the
devil
himself
had
paid
them
a
visit
they
had
decided
upon
the
latter
course
in
the
secret
council
held
before
they
left
paris
and
subsequently
everything
had
been
done
to
insure
the
success
of
an
expedition
which
promised
some
real
excitement
to
jaded
spirits
weary
of
paris
and
its
pleasures
an
extremely
light
pirogue
made
at
marseilles
on
a
malayan
model
enabled
them
to
cross
the
reef
until
the
rocks
rose
from
out
of
the
water
then
two
cables
of
iron
wire
were
fastened
several
feet
apart
between
one
rock
and
another
these
wire
ropes
slanted
upwards
and
downwards
in
opposite
directions
so
that
baskets
of
iron
wire
could
travel
to
and
fro
along
them
and
in
this
manner
the
rocks
were
covered
with
a
system
of
baskets
and
not
unlike
the
filaments
which
a
certain
species
of
spider
weaves
about
a
tree
the
chinese
an
essentially
imitative
people
were
the
first
to
take
a
lesson
from
the
work
of
instinct
fragile
as
these
bridges
were
they
were
always
ready
for
use
high
waves
and
the
caprices
of
the
sea
could
not
throw
them
out
of
working
order
the
ropes
hung
just
sufficiently
slack
so
as
to
present
to
the
breakers
that
particular
curve
discovered
by
cachin
the
immortal
creator
of
the
harbour
at
cherbourg
against
this
cunningly
devised
line
the
angry
surge
is
powerless
the
law
of
that
curve
was
a
secret
wrested
from
nature
by
that
faculty
of
observation
in
which
nearly
all
human
genius
consists
de
montriveau
s
companions
were
alone
on
board
the
vessel
and
out
of
sight
of
every
human
eye
no
one
from
the
deck
of
a
passing
vessel
could
have
discovered
either
the
brig
hidden
among
the
reefs
or
the
men
at
work
among
the
rocks
they
lay
below
the
ordinary
range
of
the
most
powerful
telescope
eleven
days
were
spent
in
preparation
before
the
thirteen
with
all
their
infernal
power
could
reach
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
the
body
of
the
rock
rose
up
straight
from
the
sea
to
a
height
of
thirty
fathoms
any
attempt
to
climb
the
sheer
wall
of
granite
seemed
impossible
a
mouse
might
as
well
try
to
creep
up
the
slippery
sides
of
a
plain
china
vase
still
there
was
a
cleft
a
straight
line
of
fissure
so
fortunately
placed
that
large
blocks
of
wood
could
be
wedged
firmly
into
it
at
a
distance
of
about
a
foot
apart
into
these
blocks
the
daring
workers
drove
iron
cramps
specially
made
for
the
purpose
with
a
broad
iron
bracket
at
the
outer
end
through
which
a
hole
had
been
drilled
each
bracket
carried
a
light
deal
board
which
corresponded
with
a
notch
made
in
a
pole
that
reached
to
the
top
of
the
cliffs
and
was
firmly
planted
in
the
beach
at
their
feet
with
ingenuity
worthy
of
these
men
who
found
nothing
impossible
one
of
their
number
a
skilled
mathematician
had
calculated
the
angle
from
which
the
steps
must
start
so
that
from
the
middle
they
rose
gradually
like
the
sticks
of
a
fan
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
descended
in
the
same
fashion
to
its
base
that
miraculously
light
yet
perfectly
firm
staircase
cost
them
days
of
toil
a
little
tinder
and
the
surf
of
the
sea
would
destroy
all
trace
of
it
forever
in
a
single
night
a
betrayal
of
the
secret
was
impossible
and
all
search
for
the
violators
of
the
convent
was
doomed
to
failure
at
the
top
of
the
rock
there
was
a
platform
with
sheer
precipice
on
all
sides
the
thirteen
reconnoitring
the
ground
with
their
glasses
from
the
masthead
made
certain
that
though
the
ascent
was
steep
and
rough
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
gaining
the
convent
garden
where
the
trees
were
thick
enough
for
a
after
such
great
efforts
they
would
not
risk
the
success
of
their
enterprise
and
were
compelled
to
wait
till
the
moon
passed
out
of
her
last
quarter
for
two
nights
montriveau
wrapped
in
his
cloak
lay
out
on
the
rock
platform
the
singing
at
vespers
and
matins
filled
him
with
unutterable
joy
he
stood
under
the
wall
to
hear
the
music
of
the
organ
listening
intently
for
one
voice
among
the
rest
but
in
spite
of
the
silence
the
confused
effect
of
music
was
all
that
reached
his
ears
in
those
sweet
harmonies
defects
of
execution
are
lost
the
pure
spirit
of
art
comes
into
direct
communication
with
the
spirit
of
the
hearer
making
no
demand
on
the
attention
no
strain
on
the
power
of
listening
intolerable
memories
awoke
all
the
love
within
him
seemed
to
break
into
blossom
again
at
the
breath
of
that
music
he
tried
to
find
auguries
of
happiness
in
the
air
during
the
last
night
he
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
an
ungrated
window
for
bars
were
not
needed
on
the
side
of
the
precipice
a
light
shone
there
all
through
the
hours
and
that
instinct
of
the
heart
which
is
sometimes
true
and
as
often
false
cried
within
him
she
is
there
she
is
certainly
there
tomorrow
she
will
be
mine
he
said
to
himself
and
joy
blended
with
the
slow
tinkling
of
a
bell
that
began
to
ring
strange
unaccountable
workings
of
the
heart
the
nun
wasted
by
yearning
love
worn
out
with
tears
and
fasting
prayer
and
vigils
the
woman
of
who
had
passed
through
heavy
trials
was
loved
more
passionately
than
the
lighthearted
girl
the
woman
of
the
sylphide
had
ever
been
but
is
there
not
for
men
of
vigorous
character
something
attractive
in
the
sublime
expression
engraven
on
women
s
faces
by
the
impetuous
stirrings
of
thought
and
misfortunes
of
no
ignoble
kind
is
there
not
a
beauty
of
suffering
which
is
the
most
interesting
of
all
beauty
to
those
men
who
feel
that
within
them
there
is
an
inexhaustible
wealth
of
tenderness
and
consoling
pity
for
a
creature
so
gracious
in
weakness
so
strong
with
love
it
is
the
ordinary
nature
that
is
attracted
by
young
smooth
beauty
or
in
one
word
by
prettiness
in
some
faces
love
awakens
amid
the
wrinkles
carved
by
sorrow
and
the
ruin
made
by
melancholy
montriveau
could
not
but
feel
drawn
to
these
for
can
not
a
lover
with
the
voice
of
a
great
longing
call
forth
a
wholly
new
creature
a
creature
athrob
with
the
life
but
just
begun
breaks
forth
for
him
alone
from
the
outward
form
that
is
fair
for
him
and
faded
for
all
the
world
besides
does
he
not
love
two
women
one
of
them
as
others
see
her
is
pale
and
wan
and
sad
but
the
other
the
unseen
love
that
his
heart
knows
is
an
angel
who
understands
life
through
feeling
and
is
adorned
in
all
her
glory
only
for
love
s
high
festivals
the
general
left
his
post
before
sunrise
but
not
before
he
had
heard
voices
singing
together
sweet
voices
full
of
tenderness
sounding
faintly
from
the
cell
when
he
came
down
to
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
where
his
friends
were
waiting
he
told
them
that
never
in
his
life
had
he
felt
such
enthralling
bliss
and
in
the
few
words
there
was
that
unmistakable
thrill
of
repressed
strong
feeling
that
magnificent
utterance
which
all
men
respect
that
night
eleven
of
his
devoted
comrades
made
the
ascent
in
the
darkness
each
man
carried
a
poniard
a
provision
of
chocolate
and
a
set
of
tools
they
climbed
the
outer
walls
with
and
crossed
the
cemetery
of
the
convent
montriveau
recognised
the
long
vaulted
gallery
through
which
he
went
to
the
parlour
and
remembered
the
windows
of
the
room
his
plans
were
made
and
adopted
in
a
moment
they
would
effect
an
entrance
through
one
of
the
windows
in
the
carmelite
s
half
of
the
parlour
find
their
way
along
the
corridors
ascertain
whether
the
sister
s
names
were
written
on
the
doors
find
sister
theresa
s
cell
surprise
her
as
she
slept
and
carry
her
off
bound
and
gagged
the
programme
presented
no
difficulties
to
men
who
combined
boldness
and
a
convict
s
dexterity
with
the
knowledge
peculiar
to
men
of
the
world
especially
as
they
would
not
scruple
to
give
a
stab
to
ensure
silence
in
two
hours
the
bars
were
sawn
through
three
men
stood
on
guard
outside
and
two
inside
the
parlour
the
rest
barefooted
took
up
their
posts
along
the
corridor
young
henri
de
marsay
the
most
dexterous
man
among
them
disguised
by
way
of
precaution
in
a
carmelite
s
robe
exactly
like
the
costume
of
the
convent
led
the
way
and
montriveau
came
immediately
behind
him
the
clock
struck
three
just
as
the
two
men
reached
the
dormitory
cells
they
soon
saw
the
position
everything
was
perfectly
quiet
with
the
help
of
a
dark
lantern
they
read
the
names
luckily
written
on
every
door
together
with
the
picture
of
a
saint
or
saints
and
the
mystical
words
which
every
nun
takes
as
a
kind
of
motto
for
the
beginning
of
her
new
life
and
the
revelation
of
her
last
thought
montriveau
reached
sister
theresa
s
door
and
read
the
inscription
invocatione
sanctae
matris
and
her
motto
in
suddenly
his
companion
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
a
bright
light
was
streaming
through
the
chinks
of
the
door
de
ronquerolles
came
up
at
that
moment
all
the
nuns
are
in
the
church
he
said
they
are
beginning
the
office
for
the
i
will
stay
here
said
montriveau
go
back
into
the
parlour
and
shut
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
he
threw
open
the
door
and
rushed
in
preceded
by
his
disguised
companion
who
let
down
the
veil
over
his
face
there
before
them
lay
the
dead
duchess
her
plank
bed
had
been
laid
on
the
floor
of
the
outer
room
of
her
cell
between
two
lighted
candles
neither
montriveau
nor
de
marsay
spoke
a
word
or
uttered
a
cry
but
they
looked
into
each
other
s
faces
the
general
s
dumb
gesture
tried
to
say
let
us
carry
her
away
quickly
shouted
ronquerolles
the
procession
of
nuns
is
leaving
the
church
you
will
be
caught
with
magical
swiftness
of
movement
prompted
by
an
intense
desire
the
dead
woman
was
carried
into
the
convent
parlour
passed
through
the
window
and
lowered
from
the
walls
before
the
abbess
followed
by
the
nuns
returned
to
take
up
sister
theresa
s
body
the
sister
left
in
charge
had
imprudently
left
her
post
there
were
secrets
that
she
longed
to
know
and
so
busy
was
she
ransacking
the
inner
room
that
she
heard
nothing
and
was
horrified
when
she
came
back
to
find
that
the
body
was
gone
before
the
women
in
their
blank
amazement
could
think
of
making
a
search
the
duchess
had
been
lowered
by
a
cord
to
the
foot
of
the
crags
and
montriveau
s
companions
had
destroyed
all
traces
of
their
work
by
nine
o
clock
that
morning
there
was
not
a
sign
to
show
that
either
staircase
or
had
ever
existed
and
sister
theresa
s
body
had
been
taken
on
board
the
brig
came
into
the
port
to
ship
her
crew
and
sailed
that
day
montriveau
down
in
the
cabin
was
left
alone
with
antoinette
de
navarreins
for
some
hours
it
seemed
as
if
her
dead
face
was
transfigured
for
him
by
that
unearthly
beauty
which
the
calm
of
death
gives
to
the
body
before
it
perishes
look
here
said
ronquerolles
when
montriveau
reappeared
on
deck
was
a
woman
once
now
it
is
nothing
let
us
tie
a
cannon
ball
to
both
feet
and
throw
the
body
overboard
and
if
ever
you
think
of
her
again
think
of
her
as
of
some
book
that
you
read
as
a
yes
assented
montriveau
it
is
nothing
now
but
a
that
is
sensible

painter
one
of
those
sights
in
which
most
horror
is
to
be
encountered
is
surely
the
general
aspect
of
the
parisian
populace
a
people
fearful
to
behold
gaunt
yellow
tawny
is
not
paris
a
vast
field
in
perpetual
turmoil
from
a
storm
of
interests
beneath
which
are
whirled
along
a
crop
of
human
beings
who
are
more
often
than
not
reaped
by
death
only
to
be
born
again
as
pinched
as
ever
men
whose
twisted
and
contorted
faces
give
out
at
every
pore
the
instinct
the
desire
the
poisons
with
which
their
brains
are
pregnant
not
faces
so
much
as
masks
masks
of
weakness
masks
of
strength
masks
of
misery
masks
of
joy
masks
of
hypocrisy
all
alike
worn
and
stamped
with
the
indelible
signs
of
a
panting
cupidity
what
is
it
they
want
gold
or
pleasure
a
few
observations
upon
the
soul
of
paris
may
explain
the
causes
of
its
cadaverous
physiognomy
which
has
but
two
ages
youth
and
decay
youth
wan
and
colorless
decay
painted
to
seem
young
in
looking
at
this
excavated
people
foreigners
who
are
not
prone
to
reflection
experience
at
first
a
movement
of
disgust
towards
the
capital
that
vast
workshop
of
delights
from
which
in
a
short
time
they
can
not
even
extricate
themselves
and
where
they
stay
willingly
to
be
corrupted
a
few
words
will
suffice
to
justify
physiologically
the
almost
infernal
hue
of
parisian
faces
for
it
is
not
in
mere
sport
that
paris
has
been
called
a
hell
take
the
phrase
for
truth
there
all
is
smoke
and
fire
everything
gleams
crackles
flames
evaporates
dies
out
then
lights
up
again
with
shooting
sparks
and
is
consumed
in
no
other
country
has
life
ever
been
more
ardent
or
acute
the
social
nature
even
in
fusion
seems
to
say
after
each
completed
work
pass
on
to
another
just
as
nature
says
herself
like
nature
herself
this
social
nature
is
busied
with
insects
and
flowers
of
a
day
ephemeral
trifles
and
so
too
it
throws
up
fire
and
flame
from
its
eternal
crater
perhaps
before
analyzing
the
causes
which
lend
a
special
physiognomy
to
each
tribe
of
this
intelligent
and
mobile
nation
the
general
cause
should
be
pointed
out
which
bleaches
and
discolors
tints
with
blue
or
brown
individuals
in
more
or
less
degree
by
dint
of
taking
interest
in
everything
the
parisian
ends
by
being
interested
in
nothing
no
emotion
dominating
his
face
which
friction
has
rubbed
away
it
turns
gray
like
the
faces
of
those
houses
upon
which
all
kinds
of
dust
and
smoke
have
blown
in
effect
the
parisian
with
his
indifference
on
the
day
for
what
the
morrow
will
bring
forth
lives
like
a
child
whatever
may
be
his
age
he
grumbles
at
everything
consoles
himself
for
everything
jests
at
everything
forgets
desires
and
tastes
everything
seizes
all
with
passion
quits
all
with
indifference
his
kings
his
conquests
his
glory
his
idols
of
bronze
or
glass
as
he
throws
away
his
stockings
his
hats
and
his
fortune
in
paris
no
sentiment
can
withstand
the
drift
of
things
and
their
current
compels
a
struggle
in
which
the
passions
are
relaxed
there
love
is
a
desire
and
hatred
a
whim
there
s
no
true
kinsman
but
the
note
no
better
friend
than
the
pawnbroker
this
universal
toleration
bears
its
fruits
and
in
the
salon
as
in
the
street
there
is
no
one
there
is
no
one
absolutely
useful
or
absolutely
harmful
knaves
or
fools
men
of
wit
or
integrity
there
everything
is
tolerated
the
government
and
the
guillotine
religion
and
the
cholera
you
are
always
acceptable
to
this
world
you
will
never
be
missed
by
it
what
then
is
the
dominating
impulse
in
this
country
without
morals
without
faith
without
any
sentiment
wherein
however
every
sentiment
belief
and
moral
has
its
origin
and
end
it
is
gold
and
pleasure
take
those
two
words
for
a
lantern
and
explore
that
great
stucco
cage
that
hive
with
its
black
gutters
and
follow
the
windings
of
that
thought
which
agitates
sustains
and
occupies
it
consider
and
in
the
first
place
examine
the
world
which
possesses
nothing
the
artisan
the
man
of
the
proletariat
who
uses
his
hands
his
tongue
his
back
his
right
arm
his
five
fingers
to
live
well
this
very
man
who
should
be
the
first
to
economize
his
vital
principle
outruns
his
strength
yokes
his
wife
to
some
machine
wears
out
his
child
and
ties
him
to
the
wheel
the
manufacturer
or
i
know
not
what
secondary
thread
which
sets
in

all
these
folk

this
middleman
has
come
to
that
world
of
sweat
and
of
study
and
patience
with
promises
of
lavish
wages
either
in
the
name
of
the
town
s
caprices
or
with
the
voice
of
the
monster
dubbed
speculation
thus
these
set
themselves
to
watch
work
and
suffer
to
fast
sweat
and
bestir
them
then
careless
of
the
future
greedy
of
pleasure
counting
on
their
right
arm
as
the
painter
on
his
palette
lords
for
one
day
they
throw
their
money
on
mondays
to
the
which
gird
the
town
like
a
belt
of
mud
haunts
of
the
most
shameless
of
the
daughters
of
venus
in
which
the
periodical
money
of
this
people
as
ferocious
in
their
pleasures
as
they
are
calm
at
work
is
squandered
as
it
had
been
at
play
for
five
days
then
there
is
no
repose
for
this
laborious
portion
of
paris
it
is
given
up
to
actions
which
make
it
warped
and
rough
lean
and
pale
gush
forth
with
a
thousand
fits
of
creative
energy
and
then
its
pleasure
its
repose
are
an
exhausting
debauch
swarthy
and
black
with
blows
white
with
intoxication
or
yellow
with
indigestion
it
lasts
but
two
days
but
it
steals
s
bread
the
week
s
soup
the
wife
s
dress
the
child
s
wretched
rags
men
born
doubtless
to
be

beneath

yoke
of

and

been

vulcanized
is
not
vulcan
with
his
hideousness
and
his
strength
the
emblem
of
this
strong
and
hideous
nation
sublime
in
its
mechanical
intelligence
patient
in
its
season
and
once
in
a
century
terrible
inflammable
as
gunpowder
and
ripe
with
brandy
for
the
madness
of
revolution
with
wits
enough
in
fine
to
take
fire
at
a
captious
word
which
signifies
to
it
always
gold
and
pleasure
if
we
comprise
in
it
all
those
who
hold
out
their
hands
for
an
alms
for
lawful
wages
or
the
five
francs
that
are
granted
to
every
kind
of
parisian
prostitution

happily
by

this
people

glutted
sleeps
off
its
pleasure
is
penniless
and
returns
to
its
labor
to
dry
bread
stimulated
by
a
need
of
material
procreation
which
has
become

its
phenomenal
virtues

complete
men
unknown
napoleons
who
are
the
type
of
its
strength
carried
to
its
highest
expression
and
sum
up
its
social
capacity
in
an
existence
wherein
thought
and
movement
combine
less
to
bring
joy
into
it
than
to
neutralize

chance

chance
has
favored
him
with

he
has
been
able
to
look
forward
has
met
with
a
wife
and
found
himself
a
father
and
after
some
years
of
hard
privation
he
embarks
in
some
little
draper
s
business
hires
a
shop
if
neither
sickness
nor
vice
blocks
his
way
if
he
has
prospered
there
is
the
sketch
of
this
normal
life
and
in
the
first
place
hail
to
that
king
of
parisian
activity
to
whom
time
and
space
give
way
yes
hail
to
that
being
composed
of
saltpetre
and
gas
who
makes
children
for
france
during
his
laborious
nights
and
in
the
day
multiplies
his
personality
for
the
service
glory
and
pleasure
of
his
this
man
solves
the
problem
of
sufficing
at
once
to
his
amiable
wife
to
his
hearth
to
the
to
his
office
to
the
national
guard
to
the
opera
and
to
god
but
only
in
order
that
the
his
office
the
national
guard
the
opera
his
wife
and
god
may
be
changed
into
coin
in
fine
hail
to
an
irreproachable
pluralist
up
every
day
at
five
o
clock
he
traverses
like
a
bird
the
space
which
separates
his
dwelling
from
the
rue
montmartre
let
it
blow
or
thunder
rain
or
snow
he
is
at
the
and
waits
there
for
the
load
of
newspapers
which
he
has
undertaken
to
distribute
he
receives
this
political
bread
with
eagerness
takes
it
bears
it
away
at
nine
o
clock
he
is
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
flings
a
jest
to
his
wife
snatches
a
loud
kiss
from
her
gulps
down
a
cup
of
coffee
or
scolds
his
children
at
a
quarter
to
ten
he
puts
in
an
appearance
at
the
there
stuck
upon
a
stool
like
a
parrot
on
its
perch
warmed
by
paris
town
he
registers
until
four
o
clock
with
never
a
tear
or
a
smile
the
deaths
and
births
of
an
entire
district
the
sorrow
the
happiness
of
the
parish
flow
beneath
his
pen
as
the
essence
of
the
traveled
before
upon
his
shoulders
nothing
weighs
upon
him
he
goes
always
straight
before
him
takes
his
patriotism
ready
made
from
the
newspaper
contradicts
no
one
shouts
or
applauds
with
the
world
and
lives
like
a
bird
two
yards
from
his
parish
in
the
event
of
an
important
ceremony
he
can
yield
his
place
to
an
assistant
and
betake
himself
to
chant
a
requiem
from
a
stall
in
the
church
of
which
on
sundays
he
is
the
fairest
ornament
where
his
is
the
most
imposing
voice
where
he
distorts
his
huge
mouth
with
energy
to
thunder
out
a
joyous
so
is
he
chorister
at
four
o
clock
freed
from
his
official
servitude
he
reappears
to
shed
joy
and
gaiety
upon
the
most
famous
shop
in
the
city
happy
is
his
wife
he
has
no
time
to
be
jealous
he
is
a
man
of
action
rather
than
of
sentiment
his
mere
arrival
spurs
the
young
ladies
at
the
counter
their
bright
eyes
storm
the
customers
he
expands
in
the
midst
of
all
the
finery
the
lace
and
muslin
kerchiefs
that
their
cunning
hands
have
wrought
or
again
more
often
still
before
his
dinner
he
waits
on
a
client
copies
the
page
of
a
newspaper
or
carries
to
the
doorkeeper
some
goods
that
have
been
delayed
every
other
day
at
six
he
is
faithful
to
his
post
a
permanent
bass
for
the
chorus
he
betakes
himself
to
the
opera
prepared
to
become
a
soldier
or
an
arab
prisoner
savage
peasant
spirit
camel
s
leg
or
lion
a
devil
or
a
genie
a
slave
or
a
eunuch
black
or
white
always
ready
to
feign
joy
or
sorrow
pity
or
astonishment
to
utter
cries
that
never
vary
to
hold
his
tongue
to
hunt
or
fight
for
rome
or
egypt
but
always
at
heart
a
huckster
still
at
midnight
he
returns
a
man
the
good
husband
the
tender
father
he
slips
into
the
conjugal
bed
his
imagination
still
afire
with
the
illusive
forms
of
the
operatic
nymphs
and
so
turns
to
the
profit
of
conjugal
love
the
world
s
depravities
the
voluptuous
curves
of
taglioni
s
leg
and
finally
if
he
sleeps
he
sleeps
apace
and
hurries
through
his
slumber
as
he
does
his
life
this
man
sums
up
all
things
history
literature
politics
government
religion
military
science
is
he
not
a
living
encyclopaedia
a
grotesque
atlas
ceaselessly
in
motion
like
paris
itself
and
knowing
not
repose
he
is
all
legs
no
physiognomy
could
preserve
its
purity
amid
such
toils
perhaps
the
artisan
who
dies
at
thirty
an
old
man
his
stomach
tanned
by
repeated
doses
of
brandy
will
be
held
according
to
certain
leisured
philosophers
to
be
happier
than
the
huckster
is
the
one
perishes
in
a
breath
and
the
other
by
degrees
from
his
eight
industries
from
the
labor
of
his
shoulders
his
throat
his
hands
from
his
wife
and
his
business
the
one
derives
as
from
so
many
farms
children
some
thousands
of
francs
and
the
most
laborious
happiness
that
has
ever
diverted
the
heart
of
man
this
fortune
and
these
children
or
the
children
who
sum
up
everything
for
him
become
the
prey
of
the
world
above
to
which
he
brings
his
ducats
and
his
daughter
or
his
son
reared
at
college
who
with
more
education
than
his
father
raises
higher
his
ambitious
gaze
often
the
son
of
a
retail
tradesman
would
fain
be
something
in
the
state

of
that

will

old
face
with
no

eyes
with
no

in

limbs
dragging
himself
with

along

themselves
merrily

dust

his

has
won
renown
or
at
some
family
ball
where
he
suffocates
till
midnight
some
fools
are
surprised
at
the
phantasmagoria
of
the
monads
which
they
see
with
the
aid
of
the
microscope
in
a
drop
of
water
but
what
would
rabelais
gargantua
that
misunderstood
figure
of
an
audacity
so
sublime
what
would
that
giant
say
fallen
from
the
celestial
spheres
if
he
amused
himself
by
contemplating
the
motions
of
this
secondary
life
of
paris
of
which
here
is
one
of
the
formulae
have
you
seen
one
of
those
little
constructions
cold
in
summer
and
with
no
other
warmth
than
a
small
stove
in
winter
placed
beneath
the
vast
copper
dome
which
crowns
the
madame
is
there
by
morning
she
is
engaged
at
the
markets
and
makes
by
this
occupation
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
people
say
monsieur
when
madame
is
up
passes
into
a
gloomy
office
where
he
lends
money
till
the
to
the
tradesmen
of
his
district
by
nine
o
clock
he
is
at
the
passport
office
of
which
he
is
one
of
the
minor
officials
by
evening
he
is
at
the
of
the
theatre
italien
or
of
any
other
theatre
you
like
the
children
are
put
out
to
nurse
and
only
return
to
be
sent
to
college
or
to
monsieur
and
madame
live
on
the
third
floor
have
but
one
cook
give
dances
in
a
salon
twelve
foot
by
eight
lit
by
argand
lamps
but
they
give
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
to
their
daughter
and
retire
at
the
age
of
fifty
an
age
when
they
begin
to
show
themselves
on
the
balcony
of
the
opera
in
a
at
longchamps
or
on
sunny
days
in
faded
clothes
on
the
boulevards
the
fruit
of
all
this
sowing
respected
by
their
neighbors
in
good
odor
with
the
government
connected
with
the
upper
middle
classes
monsieur
obtains
at
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
his
daughter
s
a
parochial
mayor
invites
him
to
his
evenings
these
labors
then
are
for
the
good
of
the
children
whom
these
lower
middle
classes
are
inevitably
driven
to
exalt
thus
each
sphere
directs
all
its
efforts
towards
the
sphere
above
it
the
son
of
the
rich
grocer
becomes
a
notary
the
son
of
the
timber
merchant
becomes
a
magistrate
no
link
is
wanting
in
the
chain
and
everything
stimulates
the
upward
march
of
money
thus
we
are
brought
to
the
third
circle
of
this
hell
which
perhaps
will
some
day
find
its
dante
in
this
third
social
circle
a
sort
of
parisian
belly
in
which
the
interests
of
the
town
are
digested
and
where
they
are
condensed
into
the
form
known
as
there
moves
and
agitates
as
by
some
acrid
and
bitter
intestinal
process
the
crowd
of
lawyers
doctors
notaries
councillors
business
men
bankers
big
merchants
speculators
and
magistrates
here
are
to
be
found
even
more
causes
of
moral
and
physical
destruction
than
elsewhere
these
people
almost
all
of
them
live
in
unhealthy
offices
in
fetid
in
little
barred
dens
and
spend
their
days
bowed
down
beneath
the
weight
of
affairs
they
rise
at
dawn
to
be
in
time
not
to
be
left
behind
to
gain
all
or
not
to
lose
to
overreach
a
man
or
his
money
to
open
or
wind
up
some
business
to
take
advantage
of
some
fleeting
opportunity
to
get
a
man
hanged
or
set
him
free
they
infect
their
horses
they
overdrive
and
age
and
break
them
like
their
own
legs
before
their
time
time
is
their
tyrant
it
fails
them
it
escapes
them
they
can
neither
expand
it
nor
cut
it
short
what
soul
can
remain
great
pure
moral
and
generous
and
consequently
what
face
retain
its
beauty
in
this
depraving
practice
of
a
calling
which
compels
one
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
public
sorrows
to
analyze
them
to
weigh
them
estimate
them
and
mark
them
out
by
rule
where
do
these
folk
put
aside
their
hearts
i
do
not
know
but
they
leave
them
somewhere
or
other
when
they
have
any
before
they
descend
each
morning
into
the
abyss
of
the
misery
which
puts
families
on
the
rack
for
them
there
is
no
such
thing
as
mystery
they
see
the
reverse
side
of
society
whose
confessors
they
are
and
despise
it
then
whatever
they
do
owing
to
their
contact
with
corruption
they
either
are
horrified
at
it
and
grow
gloomy
or
else
out
of
lassitude
or
some
secret
compromise
espouse
it
in
fine
they
necessarily
become
callous
to
every
sentiment
since
man
his
laws
and
his
institutions
make
them
steal
like
jackals
from
corpses
that
are
still
warm
at
all
hours
the
financier
is
trampling
on
the
living
the
attorney
on
the
dead
the
pleader
on
the
conscience
forced
to
be
speaking
without
a
rest
they
all
substitute
words
for
ideas
phrases
for
feelings
and
their
soul
becomes
a
larynx
neither
the
great
merchant
nor
the
judge
nor
the
pleader
preserves
his
sense
of
right
they
feel
no
more
they
apply
set
rules
that
leave
cases
out
of
count
borne
along
by
their
headlong
course
they
are
neither
husbands
nor
fathers
nor
lovers
they
glide
on
sledges
over
the
facts
of
life
and
live
at
all
times
at
the
high
pressure
conduced
by
business
and
the
vast
city
when
they
return
to
their
homes
they
are
required
to
go
to
a
ball
to
the
opera
into
society
where
they
can
make
clients
acquaintances
protectors
they
all
eat
to
excess
play
and
keep
vigil
and
their
faces
become
bloated
flushed
and
emaciated
to
this
terrific
expenditure
of
intellectual
strength
to
such
multifold
moral
contradictions
they
oppose
not
indeed
pleasure
it
would
be
too
pale
a
contrast
but
debauchery
a
debauchery
both
secret
and
alarming
for
they
have
all
means
at
their
disposal
and
fix
the
morality
of
society
their
genuine
stupidity
lies
hid
beneath
their
specialism
they
know
their
business
but
are
ignorant
of
everything
which
is
outside
it
so
that
to
preserve
their
they
question
everything
are
crudely
and
crookedly
critical
they
appear
to
be
sceptics
and
are
in
reality
simpletons
they
swamp
their
wits
in
interminable
arguments
almost
all
conveniently
adopt
social
literary
or
political
prejudices
to
do
away
with
the
need
of
having
opinions
just
as
they
adapt
their
conscience
to
the
standard
of
the
code
or
the
tribunal
of
commerce
having
started
early
to
become
men
of
note
they
turn
into
mediocrities
and
crawl
over
the
high
places
of
the
world
so
too
their
faces
present
the
harsh
pallor
the
deceitful
coloring
those
dull
tarnished
eyes
and
garrulous
sensual
mouths
in
which
the
observer
recognizes
the
symptoms
of
the
degeneracy
of
the
thought
and
its
rotation
in
the
circle
of
a
special
idea
which
destroys
the
creative
faculties
of
the
brain
and
the
gift
of
seeing
in
large
of
generalizing
and
deducing
no
man
who
has
allowed
himself
to
be
caught
in
the
revolutions
of
the
gear
of
these
huge
machines
can
ever
become
great
if
he
is
a
doctor
either
he
has
practised
little
or
he
is
an
exception
a
bichat
who
dies
young
if
a
great
merchant
something
remains
he
is

who
moreover

envious

themselves
with
aristocratic

if
the
ambition

that
of
the
small
tradesman
here
too
are
the
same
passions
the
type
of
this
class
might
be
either
an
ambitious
bourgeois
who
after
a
life
of
privation
and
continual
scheming
passes
into
the
council
of
state
as
an
ant
passes
through
a
chink
or
some
newspaper
editor
jaded
with
intrigue
whom
the
king
makes
a
peer
of
france
perhaps
to
revenge
himself
on
the
nobility
or
some
notary

of
his
parish
all
people
crushed
with
business
who
if
they
attain
their
end
are
literally
in
its
attainment
in
france
the
usage
is
to
glorify
wigs
napoleon
louis
the
great
rulers
alone
have
always
wished
for
young
men
to
fulfil
their
projects
above
this
sphere
the
artist
world
exists
but
here
too
the
faces
stamped
with
the
seal
of
originality
are
worn
nobly
indeed
but
worn
fatigued
nervous
harassed
by
a
need
of
production
outrun
by
their
costly
fantasies
worn
out
by
devouring
genius
hungry
for
pleasure
the
artists
of
paris
would
all
regain
by
excessive
labor
what
they
have
lost
by
idleness
and
vainly
seek
to
reconcile
the
world
and
glory
money
and

panting

at

because

their

too
soon
few
of
these
figures
originally
sublime
remain
beautiful
on
the
other
hand
the
flagrant
beauty
of
their
heads
is
not
understood
an
artist
s
face
is
always
exorbitant
it
is
always
above
or
below
the
conventional
lines
of
what
fools
call
the
what
power
is
it
that
destroys
them
passion
every
passion
in
paris
resolves
into
two
terms
gold
and
pleasure
now
do
you
not
breathe
again
do
you
not
feel
air
and
space
purified
here
is
neither
labor
nor
suffering
the
soaring
arch
of
gold
has
reached
the
summit
from
the
lowest
gutters
where
its
stream
commences
from
the
little
shops
where
it
is
stopped
by
puny
from
the
heart
of
the
and
great
workshops
where
its
volume
is
that
of
ingots
gold
in
the
shape
of
dowries
and
inheritances
guided
by
the
hands
of
young
girls
or
the
bony
fingers
of
age
courses
towards
the
aristocracy
where
it
will
become
a
blazing
expansive
stream
but
before
leaving
the
four
territories
upon
which
the
utmost
wealth
of
paris
is
based
it
is
fitting
having
cited
the
moral
causes
to
deduce
those
which
are
physical
and
to
call
attention
to
a
pestilence
latent
as
it
were
which
incessantly
acts
upon
the
faces
of
the
porter
the
artisan
the
small
shopkeeper
to
point
out
a
deleterious
influence
the
corruption
of
which
equals
that
of
the
parisian
administrators
who
allow
it
so
complacently
to
exist
if
the
air
of
the
houses
in
which
the
greater
proportion
of
the
middle
classes
live
is
noxious
if
the
atmosphere
of
the
streets
belches
out
cruel
miasmas
into
stuffy
where
there
is
little
air
realize
that
apart
from
this
pestilence
the
forty
thousand
houses
of
this
great
city
have
their
foundations
in
filth
which
the
powers
that
be
have
not
yet
seriously
attempted
to
enclose
with
mortar
walls
solid
enough
to
prevent
even
the
most
fetid
mud
from
filtering
through
the
soil
poisoning
the
wells
and
maintaining
subterraneously
to
lutetia
the
tradition
of
her
celebrated
name
half
of
paris
sleeps
amidst
the
putrid
exhalations
of
courts
and
streets
and
sewers
but
let
us
turn
to
the
vast
saloons
gilded
and
airy
the
hotels
in
their
gardens
the
rich
indolent
happy
moneyed
world
there
the
faces
are
lined
and
scarred
with
vanity
there
nothing
is
real
to
seek
for
pleasure
is
it
not
to
find
people
in
society
have
at
an
early
age
warped
their
nature
having
no
occupation
other
than
to
wallow
in
pleasure
they
have
speedily
misused
their
sense
as
the
artisan
has
misused
brandy
pleasure
is
of
the
nature
of
certain
medical
substances
in
order
to
obtain
constantly
the
same
effects
the
doses
must
be
doubled
and
death
or
degradation
is
contained
in
the
last
all
the
lower
classes
are
on
their
knees
before
the
wealthy
and
watch
their
tastes
in
order
to
turn
them
into
vices
and
exploit
them
thus
you
see
in
these
folk
at
an
early
age
tastes
instead
of
passions
romantic
fantasies
and
lukewarm
loves
there
impotence
reigns
there
ideas
have
ceased
they
have
evaporated
together
with
energy
amongst
the
affectations
of
the
boudoir
and
the
cajolements
of
women
there
are
fledglings
of
forty
old
doctors
of
sixty
years
the
wealthy
obtain
in
paris
wit
and
science
formulated
opinions
which
save
them
the
need
of
having
wit
science
or
opinion
of
their
own
the
irrationality
of
this
world
is
equaled
by
its
weakness
and
its
licentiousness
it
is
greedy
of
time
to
the
point
of
wasting
it
seek
in
it
for
affection
as
little
as
for
ideas
its
kisses
conceal
a
profound
indifference
its
urbanity
a
perpetual
contempt
it
has
no
other
fashion
of
love
flashes
of
wit
without
profundity
a
wealth
of
indiscretion
scandal
and
above
all
commonplace
such
is
the
sum
of
its
speech
but
these
happy
fortunates
pretend
that
they
do
not
meet
to
make
and
repeat
maxims
in
the
manner
of
la
rochefoucauld
as
though
there
did
not
exist
a
mean
invented
by
the
eighteenth
century
between
a
superfluity
and
absolute
blank
if
a
few
men
of
character
indulge
in
witticism
at
once
subtle
and
refined
they
are
misunderstood
soon
tired
of
giving
without
receiving
they
remain
at
home
and
leave
fools
to
reign
over
their
territory
this
hollow
life
this
perpetual
expectation
of
a
pleasure
which
never
comes
this
permanent
and
emptiness
of
soul
heart
and
mind
the
lassitude
of
the
upper
parisian
world
is
reproduced
on
its
features
and
stamps
its
parchment
faces
its
premature
wrinkles
that
physiognomy
of
the
wealthy
upon
which
impotence
has
set
its
grimace
in
which
gold
is
mirrored
and
whence
intelligence
has
fled
such
a
view
of
moral
paris
proves
that
physical
paris
could
not
be
other
than
it
is
this
coroneted
town
is
like
a
queen
who
being
always
with
child
has
desires
of
irresistible
fury
paris
is
the
crown
of
the
world
a
brain
which
perishes
of
genius
and
leads
human
civilization
it
is
a
great
man
a
perpetually
creative
artist
a
politician
with
who
must
of
necessity
have
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
the
vices
of
a
great
man
the
fantasies
of
the
artist
and
the
politician
s
disillusions
its
physiognomy
suggests
the
evolution
of
good
and
evil
battle
and
victory
the
moral
combat
of
the
clarion
calls
of
which
still
in
every
corner
of
the
world
and
also
the
downfall
of
thus
this
city
can
no
more
be
moral
or
cordial
or
clean
than
the
engines
which
impel
those
proud
leviathans
which
you
admire
when
they
cleave
the
waves
is
not

a
sublime
vessel
laden
with
intelligence
yes
her
arms
are
one
of
those
oracles
which
fatality
sometimes
allows
the

her
great
mast
all
of

but
she
cleaves
the
world
illuminates
it
through
the
hundred
mouths
of
her
tribunes
ploughs
the
seas
of
science
rides

full

cries
from
the
height
of
her

with
the
voice
of
her
scientists
and
artists
onward

she
carries
a
huge
crew
which
delights
in
adorning
her
with
fresh
streamers
boys
and
urchins
laughing
in
the
rigging
ballast
of
heavy

touched
with
tar
in
her
cabins
the
lucky

elegant
midshipmen
smoke
their
cigars
leaning
over
the
bulwarks
then
on
the
deck
her
soldiers
innovators

ambitious
would
accost
every

shore
and
shooting
out
their
bright
lights
upon
it
ask
for
glory
which
is
pleasure
or
for
love

thus
the
exorbitant
movement
of
the
proletariat
the
corrupting
influence
of
the
interests
which
consume
the
two
middle
classes
the
cruelties
of
the

thought
and
the
excessive
pleasure
which
is
sought
for
incessantly
by
the

the
normal
ugliness
of
the
parisian
physiognomy
it
is
only
in
the
orient
that
the
human
race
presents
a
magnificent
figure
but
that
is
an
effect
of
the
constant
calm
affected
by
those
profound
philosophers
with
their
long
pipes
their
short
legs
their
square
contour
who
despise
and
hold
activity
in
horror
whilst
in
paris
the
little
and
the
great
and
the
mediocre
run
and
leap
and
drive
whipped
on
by
an
inexorable
goddess
necessity
the
necessity
for
money
glory
and
amusement
thus
any
face
which
is
fresh
and
graceful
and
reposeful
any
really
young
face
is
in
paris
the
most
extraordinary
of
exceptions
it
is
met
with
rarely
should
you
see
one
there
be
sure
it
belongs
either
to
a
young
and
ardent
ecclesiastic
or
to
some
good
abbe
of
forty
with
three
chins
to
a
young
girl
of
pure
life
such
as
is
brought
up
in
certain
families
to
a
mother
of
twenty
still
full
of
illusions
as
she
suckles
her
to
a
young
man
newly
embarked
from
the
provinces
and
intrusted
to
the
care
of
some
devout
dowager
who
keeps
him
without
a
sou
or
perhaps
to
some
shop
assistant
who
goes
to
bed
at
midnight
wearied
out
with
folding
and
unfolding
calico
and
rises
at
seven
o
clock
to
arrange
the
window
often
again
to
some
man
of
science
or
poetry
who
lives
monastically
in
the
embrace
of
a
fine
idea
who
remains
sober
patient
and
chaste
else
to
some
fool
feeding
himself
on
folly
reeking
of
health
in
a
perpetual
state
of
absorption
with
his
own
smile
or
to
the
soft
and
happy
race
of
loungers
the
only
folk
really
happy
in
paris
which
unfolds
for
them
hour
by
hour
its
moving
poetry
nevertheless
there
is
in
paris
a
proportion
of
privileged
beings
to
whom
this
excessive
movement
of
industries
interests
affairs
arts
and
gold
is
profitable
these
beings
are
women
although
they
also
have
a
thousand
secret
causes
which
here
more
than
elsewhere
destroy
their
physiognomy
there
are
to
be
found
in
the
feminine
world
little
happy
colonies
who
live
in
oriental
fashion
and
can
preserve
their
beauty
but
these
women
rarely
show
themselves
on
foot
in
the
streets
they
lie
hid
like
rare
plants
who
only
unfold
their
petals
at
certain
hours
and
constitute
veritable
exotic
exceptions
however
paris
is
essentially
the
country
of
contrasts
if
true
sentiments
are
rare
there
there
also
are
to
be
found
as
elsewhere
noble
friendships
and
unlimited
devotion
on
this
battlefield
of
interests
and
passions
just
as
in
the
midst
of
those
marching
societies
where
egoism
triumphs
where
every
one
is
obliged
to
defend
himself
and
which
we
call
it
seems
as
though
sentiments
liked
to
be
complete
when
they
showed
themselves
and
are
sublime
by
juxtaposition
so
it
is
with
faces
in
paris
one
sometimes
sees
in
the
aristocracy
set
like
stars
the
ravishing
faces
of
young
people
the
fruit
of
quite
exceptional
manners
and
education
to
the
youthful
beauty
of
the
english
stock
they
unite
the
firmness
of
southern
traits
the
fire
of
their
eyes
a
delicious
bloom
on
their
lips
the
lustrous
black
of
their
soft
locks
a
white
complexion
a
distinguished
caste
of
features
render
them
the
flowers
of
the
human
race
magnificent
to
behold
against
the
mass
of
other
faces
worn
old
wrinkled
and
grimacing
so
women
too
admire
such
young
people
with
that
eager
pleasure
which
men
take
in
watching
a
pretty
girl
elegant
gracious
and
embellished
with
all
the
virginal
charms
with
which
our
imagination
pleases
to
adorn
the
perfect
woman
if
this
hurried
glance
at
the
population
of
paris
has
enabled
us
to
conceive
the
rarity
of
a
raphaelesque
face
and
the
passionate
admiration
which
such
an
one
must
inspire
at
the
first
sight
the
prime
interest
of
our
history
will
have
been
justified
erat
if
one
may
be
permitted
to
apply
scholastic
formulae
to
the
science
of
manners
upon
one
of
those
fine
spring
mornings
when
the
leaves
although
unfolded
are
not
yet
green
when
the
sun
begins
to
gild
the
roofs
and
the
sky
is
blue
when
the
population
of
paris
issues
from
its
cells
to
swarm
along
the
boulevards
glides
like
a
serpent
of
a
thousand
coils
through
the
rue
de
la
paix
towards
the
tuileries
saluting
the
hymeneal
magnificence
which
the
country
puts
on
on
one
of
these
joyous
days
then
a
young
man
as
beautiful
as
the
day
itself
dressed
with
taste
easy
of
manner
to
let
out
the
secret
he
was
a
the
natural
son
of
lord
dudley
and
the
famous
marquise
de
vordac
was
walking
in
the
great
avenue
of
the
tuileries
this
adonis
by
name
henri
de
marsay
was
born
in
france
when
lord
dudley
had
just
married
the
young
lady
already
henri
s
mother
to
an
old
gentleman
called
de
marsay
this
faded
and
almost
extinguished
butterfly
recognized
the
child
as
his
own
in
consideration
of
the
life
interest
in
a
fund
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
definitively
assigned
to
his
putative
son
a
generosity
which
did
not
cost
lord
dudley
too
dear
french
funds
were
worth
at
that
time
seventeen
francs
fifty
centimes
the
old
gentleman
died
without
having
ever
known
his
wife
madame
de
marsay
subsequently
married
the
marquis
de
vordac
but
before
becoming
a
marquise
she
showed
very
little
anxiety
as
to
her
son
and
lord
dudley
to
begin
with
the
declaration
of
war
between
france
and
england
had
separated
the
two
lovers
and
fidelity
at
all
costs
was
not
and
never
will
be
the
fashion
of
paris
then
the
successes
of
the
woman
elegant
pretty
universally
adored
crushed
in
the
parisienne
the
maternal
sentiment
lord
dudley
was
no
more
troubled
about
his
offspring
than
was
the
mother
the
speedy
infidelity
of
a
young
girl
he
had
ardently
loved
gave
him
perhaps
a
sort
of
aversion
for
all
that
issued
from
her
moreover
fathers
can
perhaps
only
love
the
children
with
whom
they
are
fully
acquainted
a
social
belief
of
the
utmost
importance
for
the
peace
of
families
which
should
be
held
by
all
the
celibate
proving
as
it
does
that
paternity
is
a
sentiment
nourished
artificially
by
woman
custom
and
the
law
poor
henri
de
marsay
knew
no
other
father
than
that
one
of
the
two
who
was
not
compelled
to
be
one
the
paternity
of
de
marsay
was
naturally
most
incomplete
in
the
natural
order
it
is
but
for
a
few
fleeting
instants
that
children
have
a
father
and
de
marsay
imitated
nature
the
worthy
man
would
not
have
sold
his
name
had
he
been
free
from
vices
thus
he
squandered
without
remorse
in
gambling
hells
and
drank
elsewhere
the
few
dividends
which
the
national
treasury
paid
to
its
bondholders
then
he
handed
over
the
child
to
an
aged
sister
a
demoiselle
de
marsay
who
took
much
care
of
him
and
provided
him
out
of
the
meagre
sum
allowed
by
her
brother
with
a
tutor
an
abbe
without
a
farthing
who
took
the
measure
of
the
youth
s
future
and
determined
to
pay
himself
out
of
the
hundred
thousand
livres
for
the
care
given
to
his
pupil
for
whom
he
conceived
an
affection
as
chance
had
it
this
tutor
was
a
true
priest
one
of
those
ecclesiastics
cut
out
to
become
cardinals
in
france
or
borgias
beneath
the
tiara
he
taught
the
child
in
three
years
what
he
might
have
learned
at
college
in
ten
then
the
great
man
by
name
the
abbe
de
maronis
completed
the
education
of
his
pupil
by
making
him
study
civilization
under
all
its
aspects
he
nourished
him
on
his
experience
led
him
little
into
churches
which
at
that
time
were
closed
introduced
him
sometimes
behind
the
scenes
of
theatres
more
often
into
the
houses
of
courtesans
he
exhibited
human
emotions
to
him
one
by
one
taught
him
politics
in
the
where
they
simmered
at
the
time
explained
to
him
the
machinery
of
government
and
endeavored
out
of
attraction
towards
a
fine
nature
deserted
yet
rich
in
promise
virilely
to
replace
a
mother
is
not
the
church
the
mother
of
orphans
the
pupil
was
responsive
to
so
much
care
the
worthy
priest
died
in
a
bishop
with
the
satisfaction
of
having
left
in
this
world
a
child
whose
heart
and
mind
were
so
well
moulded
that
he
could
outwit
a
man
of
forty
who
would
have
expected
to
have
found
a
heart
of
bronze
a
brain
of
steel
beneath
external
traits
as
seductive
as
ever
the
old
painters
those
naive
artists
had
given
to
the
serpent
in
the
terrestrial
paradise
nor
was
that
all
in
addition
the
prelate
had
procured
for
the
child
of
his
choice
certain
acquaintances
in
the
best
parisian
society
which
might
equal
in
value
in
the
young
man
s
hand
another
hundred
thousand
invested
livres
in
fine
this
priest
vicious
but
politic
sceptical
yet
learned
treacherous
yet
amiable
weak
in
appearance
yet
as
vigorous
physically
as
intellectually
was
so
genuinely
useful
to
his
pupil
so
complacent
to
his
vices
so
fine
a
calculator
of
all
kinds
of
strength
so
profound
when
it
was
needful
to
make
some
human
reckoning
so
youthful
at
table
at
frascati
at
i
know
not
where
that
the
grateful
henri
de
marsay
was
hardly
moved
at
aught
in
except
when
he
looked
at
the
portrait
of
his
beloved
bishop
the
only
personal
possession
which
the
prelate
had
been
able
to
bequeath
him
admirable
type
of
the
men
whose
genius
will
preserve
the
catholic
apostolic
and
roman
church
compromised
for
the
moment
by
the
feebleness
of
its
recruits
and
the
decrepit
age
of
its
pontiffs
but
if
the
church
likes
the
continental
war
prevented
young
de
marsay
from
knowing
his
real
father
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
was
aware
of
his
name
a
deserted
child
he
was
equally
ignorant
of
madame
de
marsay
naturally
he
had
little
regret
for
his
putative
father
as
for
mademoiselle
de
marsay
his
only
mother
he
built
for
her
a
handsome
little
monument
in
pere
lachaise
when
she
died
monseigneur
de
maronis
had
guaranteed
to
this
old
lady
one
of
the
best
places
in
the
skies
so
that
when
he
saw
her
die
happy
henri
gave
her
some
egotistical
tears
he
began
to
weep
on
his
own
account
observing
this
grief
the
abbe
dried
his
pupil
s
tears
bidding
him
observe
that
the
good
woman
took
her
snuff
most
offensively
and
was
becoming
so
ugly
and
deaf
and
tedious
that
he
ought
to
return
thanks
for
her
death
the
bishop
had
emancipated
his
pupil
in
then
when
the
mother
of
de
marsay
remarried
the
priest
chose
in
a
family
council
one
of
those
honest
dullards
picked
out
by
him
through
the
windows
of
his
confessional
and
charged
him
with
the
administration
of
the
fortune
the
revenues
of
which
he
was
willing
to
apply
to
the
needs
of
the
community
but
of
which
he
wished
to
preserve
the
capital
towards
the
end
of
then
henri
de
marsay
had
no
sentiment
of
obligation
in
the
world
and
was
as
free
as
an
unmated
bird
although
he
had
lived
years
he
appeared
to
be
barely
seventeen
as
a
rule
the
most
fastidious
of
his
rivals
considered
him
to
be
the
prettiest
youth
in
paris
from
his
father
lord
dudley
he
had
derived
a
pair
of
the
most
amorously
deceiving
blue
eyes
from
his
mother
the
bushiest
of
black
hair
from
both
pure
blood
the
skin
of
a
young
girl
a
gentle
and
modest
expression
a
refined
and
aristocratic
figure
and
beautiful
hands
for
a
woman
to
see
him
was
to
lose
her
head
for
him
do
you
understand
to
conceive
one
of
those
desires
which
eat
the
heart
which
are
forgotten
because
of
the
impossibility
of
satisfying
them
because
women
in
paris
are
commonly
without
tenacity
few
of
them
say
to
themselves
after
the
fashion
of
men
the
of
the
house
of
orange
underneath
this
fresh
young
life
and
in
spite
of
the
limpid
springs
in
his
eyes
henri
had
a
lion
s
courage
a
monkey
s
agility
he
could
cut
a
ball
in
half
at
ten
paces
on
the
blade
of
a
knife
he
rode
his
horse
in
a
way
that
made
you
realize
the
fable
of
the
centaur
drove
a
with
grace
was
as
light
as
a
cherub
and
quiet
as
a
lamb
but
knew
how
to
beat
a
townsman
at
the
terrible
game
of
or
cudgels
moreover
he
played
the
piano
in
a
fashion
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
become
an
artist
should
he
fall
on
calamity
and
owned
a
voice
which
would
have
been
worth
to
barbaja
fifty
thousand
francs
a
season
alas
that
all
these
fine
qualities
these
pretty
faults
were
tarnished
by
one
abominable
vice
he
believed
neither
in
man
nor
woman
god
nor
devil
capricious
nature
had
commenced
by
endowing
him
a
priest
had
completed
the
work
to
render
this
adventure
comprehensible
it
is
necessary
to
add
here
that
lord
dudley
naturally
found
many
women
disposed
to
reproduce
samples
of
such
a
delicious
pattern
his
second
masterpiece
of
this
kind
was
a
young
girl
named
euphemie
born
of
a
spanish
lady
reared
in
havana
and
brought
to
madrid
with
a
young
creole
woman
of
the
antilles
and
with
all
the
ruinous
tastes
of
the
colonies
but
fortunately
married
to
an
old
and
extremely
rich
spanish
noble
don
hijos
marquis
de
who
since
the
occupation
of
spain
by
french
troops
had
taken
up
his
abode
in
paris
and
lived
in
the
rue
lazare
as
much
from
indifference
as
from
any
respect
for
the
innocence
of
youth
lord
dudley
was
not
in
the
habit
of
keeping
his
children
informed
of
the
relations
he
created
for
them
in
all
parts
that
is
a
slightly
inconvenient
form
of
civilization
it
has
so
many
advantages
that
we
must
overlook
its
drawbacks
in
consideration
of
its
benefits
lord
dudley
to
make
no
more
words
of
it
came
to
paris
in
to
take
refuge
from
the
pursuit
of
english
justice
which
protects
nothing
oriental
except
commerce
the
exiled
lord
when
he
saw
henri
asked
who
that
handsome
young
man
might
be
then
upon
hearing
the
name
ah
it
is
my
son
what
a
pity
he
said
such
was
the
story
of
the
young
man
who
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
april
was
walking
indolently
up
the
broad
avenue
of
the
tuileries
after
the
fashion
of
all
those
animals
who
knowing
their
strength
pass
along
in
majesty
and
peace
matrons
turned
back
naively
to
look
at
him
again
other
women
without
turning
round
waited
for
him
to
pass
again
and
engraved
him
in
their
minds
that
they
might
remember
in
due
season
that
fragrant
face
which
would
not
have
disadorned
the
body
of
the
fairest
among
themselves
what
are
you
doing
here
on
sunday
said
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
to
henri
as
he
passed
there
s
a
fish
in
the
net
answered
the
young
man
this
exchange
of
thoughts
was
accomplished
by
means
of
two
significant
glances
without
it
appearing
that
either
de
ronquerolles
or
de
marsay
had
any
knowledge
of
the
other
the
young
man
was
taking
note
of
the
with
that
promptitude
of
eye
and
ear
which
is
peculiar
to
the
parisian
who
seems
at
first
to
see
and
hear
nothing
but
who
sees
and
hears
all
at
that
moment
a
young
man
came
up
to
him
and
took
him
familiarly
by
the
arm
saying
to
him
how
are
you
my
dear
de
marsay
extremely
well
de
marsay
answered
with
that
air
of
apparent
affection
which
amongst
the
young
men
of
paris
proves
nothing
either
for
the
present
or
the
future
in
effect
the
youth
of
paris
resemble
the
youth
of
no
other
town
they
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
the
young
man
who
has
something
and
the
young
man
who
has
nothing
or
the
young
man
who
thinks
and
he
who
spends
but
be
it
well
understood
this
applies
only
to
those
natives
of
the
soil
who
maintain
in
paris
the
delicious
course
of
the
elegant
life
there
exist
as
well
plenty
of
other
young
men
but
they
are
children
who
are
late
in
conceiving
parisian
life
and
who
remain
its
dupes
they
do
not
speculate
they
study
they
as
the
others
say
finally
there
are
to
be
found
besides
certain
young
people
rich
or
poor
who
embrace
careers
and
follow
them
with
a
single
heart
they
are
somewhat
like
the
emile
of
rousseau
of
the
flesh
of
citizens
and
they
never
appear
in
society
the
diplomatic
impolitely
dub
them
fools
be
they
that
or
no
they
augment
the
number
of
those
mediocrities
beneath
the
yoke
of
which
france
is
bowed
down
they
are
always
there
always
ready
to
bungle
public
or
private
concerns
with
the
dull
trowel
of
their
mediocrity
bragging
of
their
impotence
which
they
count
for
conduct
and
integrity
this
sort
of
social
infests
the
administration
the
army
the
magistracy
the
chambers
the
courts
they
diminish
and
level
down
the
country
and
constitute
in
some
manner
in
the
body
politic
a
lymph
which
infects
it
and
renders
it
flabby
these
honest
folk
call
men
of
talent
immoral
or
rogues
if
such
rogues
require
to
be
paid
for
their
services
at
least
their
services
are
there
whereas
the
other
sort
do
harm
and
are
respected
by
the
mob
but
happily
for
france
elegant
youth
stigmatizes
them
ceaselessly
under
the
name
of
louts
at
the
first
glance
then
it
is
natural
to
consider
as
very
distinct
the
two
sorts
of
young
men
who
lead
the
life
of
elegance
the
amiable
corporation
to
which
henri
de
marsay
belonged
but
the
observer
who
goes
beyond
the
superficial
aspect
of
things
is
soon
convinced
that
the
difference
is
purely
moral
and
that
nothing
is
so
deceptive
as
this
pretty
outside
nevertheless
all
alike
take
precedence
over
everybody
else
speak
rightly
or
wrongly
of
things
of
men
literature
and
the
fine
arts
have
ever
in
their
mouth
the
pitt
and
coburg
of
each
year
interrupt
a
conversation
with
a
pun
turn
into
ridicule
science
and
the
despise
all
things
which
they
do
not
know
or
which
they
fear
set
themselves
above
all
by
constituting
themselves
the
supreme
judges
of
all
they
would
all
hoax
their
fathers
and
be
ready
to
shed
crocodile
tears
upon
their
mothers
breasts
but
generally
they
believe
in
nothing
blaspheme
women
or
play
at
modesty
and
in
reality
are
led
by
some
old
woman
or
an
evil
courtesan
they
are
all
equally
eaten
to
the
bone
with
calculation
with
depravity
with
a
brutal
lust
to
succeed
and
if
you
plumbed
for
their
hearts
you
would
find
in
all
a
stone
in
their
normal
state
they
have
the
prettiest
exterior
stake
their
friendship
at
every
turn
are
captivating
alike
the
same
badinage
dominates
their
jargon
they
seek
for
oddity
in
their
toilette
glory
in
repeating
the
stupidities
of
such
and
such
actor
who
is
in
fashion
and
commence
operations
it
matters
not
with
whom
with
contempt
and
impertinence
in
order
to
have
as
it
were
the
first
move
in
the
game
but
woe
betide
him
who
does
not
know
how
to
take
a
blow
on
one
cheek
for
the
sake
of
rendering
two
they
resemble
in
fine
that
pretty
white
spray
which
crests
the
stormy
waves
they
dress
and
dance
dine
and
take
their
pleasure
on
the
day
of
waterloo
in
the
time
of
cholera
or
revolution
finally
their
expenses
are
all
the
same
but
here
the
contrast
comes
in
of
this
fluctuating
fortune
so
agreeably
flung
away
some
possess
the
capital
for
which
the
others
wait
they
have
the
same
tailors
but
the
bills
of
the
latter
are
still
to
pay
next
if
the
first
like
sieves
take
in
ideas
of
all
kinds
without
retaining
any
the
latter
compare
them
and
assimilate
all
the
good
if
the
first
believe
they
know
something
know
nothing
and
understand
everything
lend
all
to
those
who
need
nothing
and
offer
nothing
to
those
who
are
in
need
the
latter
study
secretly
others
thoughts
and
place
out
their
money
like
their
follies
at
big
interest
the
one
class
have
no
more
faithful
impressions
because
their
soul
like
a
mirror
worn
from
use
no
longer
reflects
any
image
the
others
economize
their
senses
and
life
even
while
they
seem
like
the
first
to
be
flinging
them
away
broadcast
the
first
on
the
faith
of
a
hope
devote
themselves
without
conviction
to
a
system
which
has
wind
and
tide
against
it
but
they
leap
upon
another
political
craft
when
the
first
goes
adrift
the
second
take
the
measure
of
the
future
sound
it
and
see
in
political
fidelity
what
the
english
see
in
commercial
integrity
an
element
of
success
where
the
young
man
of
possessions
makes
a
pun
or
an
epigram
upon
the
restoration
of
the
throne
he
who
has
nothing
makes
a
public
calculation
or
a
secret
reservation
and
obtains
everything
by
giving
a
handshake
to
his
friends
the
one
deny
every
faculty
to
others
look
upon
all
their
ideas
as
new
as
though
the
world
had
been
made
yesterday
they
have
unlimited
confidence
in
themselves
and
no
crueler
enemy
than
those
same
selves
but
the
others
are
armed
with
an
incessant
distrust
of
men
whom
they
estimate
at
their
value
and
are
sufficiently
profound
to
have
one
thought
beyond
their
friends
whom
they
exploit
then
of
evenings
when
they
lay
their
heads
on
their
pillows
they
weigh
men
as
a
miser
weighs
his
gold
pieces
the
one
are
vexed
at
an
aimless
impertinence
and
allow
themselves
to
be
ridiculed
by
the
diplomatic
who
make
them
dance
for
them
by
pulling
what
is
the
main
string
of
these
puppets
their
vanity
thus
a
day
comes
when
those
who
had
nothing
have
something
and
those
who
had
something
have
nothing
the
latter
look
at
their
comrades
who
have
achieved
positions
as
cunning
fellows
their
hearts
may
be
bad
but
their
heads
are
strong
he
is
very
strong
is
the
supreme
praise
accorded
to
those
who
have
attained
political
rank
a
woman
or
a
fortune
amongst
them
are
to
be
found
certain
young
men
who
play
this
by
commencing
with
having
debts
naturally
these
are
more
dangerous
than
those
who
play
it
without
a
farthing
the
young
man
who
called
himself
a
friend
of
henri
de
marsay
was
a
who
had
come
from
the
provinces
and
whom
the
young
men
then
in
fashion
were
teaching
the
art
of
running
through
an
inheritance
but
he
had
one
last
leg
to
stand
on
in
his
province
in
the
shape
of
a
secure
establishment
he
was
simply
an
heir
who
had
passed
without
any
transition
from
his
pittance
of
a
hundred
francs
a
month
to
the
entire
paternal
fortune
and
who
if
he
had
not
wit
enough
to
perceive
that
he
was
laughed
at
was
sufficiently
cautious
to
stop
short
at
of
his
capital
he
had
learned
at
paris
for
a
consideration
of
some
thousands
of
francs
the
exact
value
of
harness
the
art
of
not
being
too
respectful
to
his
gloves
learned
to
make
skilful
meditations
upon
the
right
wages
to
give
people
and
to
seek
out
what
bargain
was
the
best
to
close
with
them
he
set
store
on
his
capacity
to
speak
in
good
terms
of
his
horses
of
his
pyrenean
hound
to
tell
by
her
dress
her
walk
her
shoes
to
what
class
a
woman
belonged
to
study
remember
a
few
fashionable
catchwords
and
win
by
his
sojourn
in
parisian
society
the
necessary
authority
to
import
later
into
his
province
a
taste
for
tea
and
silver
of
an
english
fashion
and
to
obtain
the
right
of
despising
everything
around
him
for
the
rest
of
his
days
de
marsay
had
admitted
him
to
his
society
in
order
to
make
use
of
him
in
the
world
just
as
a
bold
speculator
employs
a
confidential
clerk
the
friendship
real
or
feigned
of
de
marsay
was
a
social
position
for
paul
de
manerville
who
on
his
side
thought
himself
astute
in
exploiting
after
his
fashion
his
intimate
friend
he
lived
in
the
reflecting
lustre
of
his
friend
walked
constantly
under
his
umbrella
wore
his
boots
gilded
himself
with
his
rays
when
he
posed
in
henri
s
company
or
walked
at
his
side
he
had
the
air
of
saying
don
t
insult
us
we
are
real
he
often
permitted
himself
to
remark
fatuously
if
i
were
to
ask
henri
for
such
and
such
a
thing
he
is
a
good
enough
friend
of
mine
to
do
but
he
was
careful
never
to
ask
anything
of
him
he
feared
him
and
his
fear
although
imperceptible
reacted
upon
the
others
and
was
of
use
to
de
marsay
de
marsay
is
a
man
of
a
thousand
said
paul
ah
you
will
see
he
will
be
what
he
likes
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
find
him
one
of
these
days
minister
of
foreign
affairs
nothing
can
withstand
he
made
of
de
marsay
what
corporal
trim
made
of
his
cap
a
perpetual
instance
ask
de
marsay
and
you
will
see
or
again
the
other
day
we
were
hunting
de
marsay
and
i
he
would
not
believe
me
but
i
jumped
a
hedge
without
moving
on
my
horse
or
again
we
were
with
some
women
de
marsay
and
i
and
upon
my
word
of
honor
i
was
etc
thus
paul
de
manerville
could
not
be
classed
amongst
the
great
illustrious
and
powerful
family
of
fools
who
succeed
he
would
one
day
be
a
deputy
for
the
time
he
was
not
even
a
young
man
his
friend
de
marsay
defined
him
thus
you
ask
me
what
is
paul
paul
why
paul
de
manerville
i
am
surprised
my
dear
fellow
he
said
to
de
marsay
to
see
you
here
on
a
i
was
going
to
ask
you
the
same
is
it
an
intrigue
an
bah
i
can
mention
it
to
you
without
compromising
my
passion
besides
a
woman
who
comes
to
the
tuileries
on
sundays
is
of
no
account
aristocratically
ah
ah
hold
your
tongue
then
or
i
shall
tell
you
nothing
your
laugh
is
too
loud
you
will
make
people
think
that
we
have
lunched
too
well
last
thursday
here
on
the
terrasse
des
feuillants
i
was
walking
along
thinking
of
nothing
at
all
but
when
i
got
to
the
gate
of
the
rue
de
castiglione
by
which
i
intended
to
leave
i
came
face
to
face
with
a
woman
or
rather
a
young
girl
who
if
she
did
not
throw
herself
at
my
head
stopped
short
less
i
think
from
human
respect
than
from
one
of
those
movements
of
profound
surprise
which
affect
the
limbs
creep
down
the
length
of
the
spine
and
cease
only
in
the
sole
of
the
feet
to
nail
you
to
the
ground
i
have
often
produced
effects
of
this
nature
a
sort
of
animal
magnetism
which
becomes
enormously
powerful
when
the
relations
are
reciprocally
precise
but
my
dear
fellow
this
was
not
stupefaction
nor
was
she
a
common
girl
morally
speaking
her
face
seemed
to
say
what
is
it
you
my
ideal
the
creation
of
my
thoughts
of
my
morning
and
evening
dreams
what
are
you
there
why
this
morning
why
not
yesterday
take
me
i
am
thine
good
i
said
to
myself
another
one
then
i
scrutinize
her
ah
my
dear
fellow
speaking
physically
my
incognita
is
the
most
adorable
feminine
person
whom
i
ever
met
she
belongs
to
that
feminine
variety
which
the
romans
call
the
woman
of
fire
and
in
chief
what
struck
me
the
most
what
i
am
still
taken
with
are
her
two
yellow
eyes
like
a
tiger
s
a
golden
yellow
that
gleams
living
gold
gold
which
thinks
gold
which
loves
and
is
determined
to
take
refuge
in
your
my
dear
fellow
we
are
full
of
her
cried
paul
she
comes
here
sometimes
girl
with
the
golden
that
is
the
name
we
have
given
her
she
is
a
young
creature
not
more
than
and
i
have
seen
her
here
in
the
time
of
the
bourbons
but
with
a
woman
who
was
worth
a
hundred
thousand
of
silence
paul
it
is
impossible
for
any
woman
to
surpass
this
girl
she
is
like
the
cat
who
rubs
herself
against
your
legs
a
white
girl
with
hair
delicate
in
appearance
but
who
must
have
downy
threads
on
the
third
phalanx
of
her
fingers
and
all
along
her
cheeks
a
white
down
whose
line
luminous
on
fine
days
begins
at
her
ears
and
loses
itself
on
her
ah
the
other
my
dear
de
marsay
she
has
black
eyes
which
have
never
wept
but
which
burn
black
eyebrows
which
meet
and
give
her
an
air
of
hardness
contradicted
by
the
compact
curve
of
her
lips
on
which
the
kisses
do
not
stay
lips
burning
and
fresh
a
moorish
color
that
warms
a
man
like
the
sun
but
upon
my
word
of
honor
she
is
like
you
you
flatter
her
a
firm
figure
the
tapering
figure
of
a
corvette
built
for
speed
which
rushes
down
upon
the
merchant
vessel
with
french
impetuosity
which
grapples
with
her
and
sinks
her
at
the
same
after
all
my
dear
fellow
answered
de
marsay
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
me
since
i
have
never
seen
her
ever
since
i
have
studied
women
my
incognita
is
the
only
one
whose
virginal
bosom
whose
ardent
and
voluptuous
forms
have
realized
for
me
the
only
woman
of
my
dreams
of
my
dreams
she
is
the
original
of
that
ravishing
picture
called
femme
caressant
sa
the
warmest
the
most
infernal
inspiration
of
the
genius
of
antiquity
a
holy
poem
prostituted
by
those
who
have
copied
it
for
frescoes
and
mosiacs
for
a
heap
of
bourgeois
who
see
in
this
gem
nothing
more
than
a
and
hang
it
on
their
whereas
it
is
the
whole
woman
an
abyss
of
pleasure
into
which
one
plunges
and
finds
no
end
whereas
it
is
the
ideal
woman
to
be
seen
sometimes
in
reality
in
spain
or
italy
almost
never
in
france
well
i
have
again
seen
this
girl
of
the
gold
eyes
this
woman
caressing
her
chimera
i
saw
her
on
friday
i
had
a
presentiment
that
on
the
following
day
she
would
be
here
at
the
same
hour
i
was
not
mistaken
i
have
taken
a
pleasure
in
following
her
without
being
observed
in
studying
her
indolent
walk
the
walk
of
the
woman
without
occupation
but
in
the
movements
of
which
one
devines
all
the
pleasure
that
lies
asleep
well
she
turned
back
again
she
saw
me
once
more
she
adored
me
once
more
trembled
shivered
it
was
then
i
noticed
the
genuine
spanish
duenna
who
looked
after
her
a
hyena
upon
whom
some
jealous
man
has
put
a
dress
a
well
paid
no
doubt
to
guard
this
delicious
creature
ah
then
the
duenna
made
me
deeper
in
love
i
grew
curious
on
saturday
nobody
and
here
i
am
waiting
for
this
girl
whose
chimera
i
am
asking
nothing
better
than
to
pose
as
the
monster
in
the
there
she
is
said
paul
every
one
is
turning
round
to
look
at
the
unknown
blushed
her
eyes
shone
she
saw
henri
she
shut
them
and
passed
by
you
say
that
she
notices
you
cried
paul
facetiously
the
duenna
looked
fixedly
and
attentively
at
the
two
young
men
when
the
unknown
and
henri
passed
each
other
again
the
young
girl
touched
him
and
with
her
hand
pressed
the
hand
of
the
young
man
then
she
turned
her
head
and
smiled
with
passion
but
the
duenna
led
her
away
very
quickly
to
the
gate
of
the
rue
de
castiglione
the
two
friends
followed
the
young
girl
admiring
the
magnificent
grace
of
the
neck
which
met
her
head
in
a
harmony
of
vigorous
lines
and
upon
which
a
few
coils
of
hair
were
tightly
wound
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
had
that
arched
slender
foot
which
presents
so
many
attractions
to
the
dainty
imagination
moreover
she
was
shod
with
elegance
and
wore
a
short
skirt
during
her
course
she
turned
from
time
to
time
to
look
at
henri
and
appeared
to
follow
the
old
woman
regretfully
seeming
to
be
at
once
her
mistress
and
her
slave
she
could
break
her
with
blows
but
could
not
dismiss
her
all
that
was
perceptible
the
two
friends
reached
the
gate
two
men
in
livery
let
down
the
step
of
a
tasteful
emblazoned
with
armorial
bearings
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
was
the
first
to
enter
it
took
her
seat
at
the
side
where
she
could
be
best
seen
when
the
carriage
turned
put
her
hand
on
the
door
and
waved
her
handkerchief
in
the
duennna
s
despite
in
contempt
of
what
might
be
said
by
the
curious
her
handkerchief
cried
to
henri
openly
follow
me
have
you
ever
seen
a
handkerchief
better
thrown
said
henri
to
paul
de
manerville
then
observing
a
fiacre
on
the
point
of
departure
having
just
set
down
a
fare
he
made
a
sign
to
the
driver
to
wait
follow
that
carriage
notice
the
house
and
the
street
where
it
stops
you
shall
have
ten
francs
paul
the
cab
followed
the
the
stopped
in
the
rue
saint
lazare
before
one
of
the
finest
houses
of
the
neighborhood
de
marsay
was
not
impulsive
any
other
young
man
would
have
obeyed
his
impulse
to
obtain
at
once
some
information
about
a
girl
who
realized
so
fully
the
most
luminous
ideas
ever
expressed
upon
women
in
the
poetry
of
the
east
but
too
experienced
to
compromise
his
good
fortune
he
had
told
his
coachman
to
continue
along
the
rue
saint
lazare
and
carry
him
back
to
his
house
the
next
day
his
confidential
valet
laurent
by
name
as
cunning
a
fellow
as
the
frontin
of
the
old
comedy
waited
in
the
vicinity
of
the
house
inhabited
by
the
unknown
for
the
hour
at
which
letters
were
distributed
in
order
to
be
able
to
spy
at
his
ease
and
hang
about
the
house
he
had
followed
the
example
of
those
police
officers
who
seek
a
good
disguise
and
bought
up
clothes
of
an
auvergnat
the
appearance
of
whom
he
sought
to
imitate
when
the
postman
who
went
the
round
of
the
rue
saint
lazare
that
morning
passed
by
laurent
feigned
to
be
a
porter
unable
to
remember
the
name
of
a
person
to
whom
he
had
to
deliver
a
parcel
and
consulted
the
postman
deceived
at
first
by
appearances
this
personage
so
picturesque
in
the
midst
of
parisian
civilization
informed
him
that
the
house
in
which
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
dwelt
belonged
to
don
hijos
marquis
de
grandee
of
spain
naturally
it
was
not
with
the
marquis
that
the
auvergnat
was
concerned
my
parcel
he
said
is
for
the
she
is
away
replied
the
postman
her
letters
are
forwarded
to
then
the
marquise
is
not
a
young
girl
who
ah
said
the
postman
interrupting
the
de
and
observing
him
attentively
you
are
as
much
a
porter
as
i
m
laurent
chinked
some
pieces
of
gold
before
the
functionary
who
began
to
smile
come
here
s
the
name
of
your
quarry
he
said
taking
from
his
leather
wallet
a
letter
bearing
a
london
stamp
upon
which
the
address
to
mademoiselle
paquita
valdes
rue
saint
lazare
hotel
paris
was
written
in
long
fine
characters
which
spoke
of
a
woman
s
hand
could
you
tap
a
bottle
of
chablis
with
a
few
dozen
oysters
and
a
with
mushrooms
to
follow
it
said
laurent
who
wished
to
win
the
postman
s
valuable
friendship
at
nine
when
my
round
is
finished
where
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
antin
and
the
rue
at
the
sans
said
laurent
hark
ye
my
friend
said
the
postman
when
he
rejoined
the
valet
an
hour
after
this
encounter
if
your
master
is
in
love
with
the
girl
he
is
in
for
a
famous
task
i
doubt
you
ll
not
succeed
in
seeing
her
in
the
ten
years
that
i
ve
been
postman
in
paris
i
have
seen
plenty
of
different
kinds
of
doors
but
i
can
tell
you
and
no
fear
of
being
called
a
liar
by
any
of
my
comrades
there
never
was
a
door
so
mysterious
as
de
s
no
one
can
get
into
the
house
without
the
lord
knows
what
and
notice
it
has
been
selected
on
purpose
between
a
courtyard
and
a
garden
to
avoid
any
communication
with
other
houses
the
porter
is
an
old
spaniard
who
never
speaks
a
word
of
french
but
peers
at
people
as
vidocq
might
to
see
if
they
are
not
thieves
if
a
lover
a
thief
or
you
i
make
no
comparisons
could
get
the
better
of
this
first
wicket
well
in
the
first
hall
which
is
shut
by
a
glazed
door
you
would
run
across
a
butler
surrounded
by
lackeys
an
old
joker
more
savage
and
surly
even
than
the
porter
if
any
one
gets
past
the
porter
s
lodge
my
butler
comes
out
waits
for
you
at
the
entrance
and
puts
you
through
a
like
a
criminal
that
has
happened
to
me
a
mere
postman
he
took
me
for
an
eavesdropper
in
disguise
he
said
laughing
at
his
nonsense
as
for
the
servants
don
t
hope
to
get
aught
out
of
them
i
think
they
are
mutes
no
one
in
the
neighborhood
knows
the
color
of
their
speech
i
don
t
know
what
wages
they
can
pay
them
to
keep
them
from
talk
and
drink
the
fact
is
they
are
not
to
be
got
at
whether
because
they
are
afraid
of
being
shot
or
that
they
have
some
enormous
sum
to
lose
in
the
case
of
an
indiscretion
if
your
master
is
fond
enough
of
mademoiselle
paquita
valdes
to
surmount
all
these
obstacles
he
certainly
won
t
triumph
over
dona
concha
marialva
the
duenna
who
accompanies
her
and
would
put
her
under
her
petticoats
sooner
than
leave
her
the
two
women
look
as
if
they
were
sewn
to
one
all
that
you
say
worthy
postman
went
on
laurent
after
having
drunk
off
his
wine
confirms
me
in
what
i
have
learned
before
upon
my
word
i
thought
they
were
making
fun
of
me
the
fruiterer
opposite
told
me
that
of
nights
they
let
loose
dogs
whose
food
is
hung
up
on
stakes
just
out
of
their
reach
these
cursed
animals
think
therefore
that
any
one
likely
to
come
in
has
designs
on
their
victuals
and
would
tear
one
to
pieces
you
will
tell
me
one
might
throw
them
down
pieces
but
it
seems
they
have
been
trained
to
touch
nothing
except
from
the
hand
of
the
the
porter
of
the
baron
de
nucingen
whose
garden
joins
at
the
top
that
of
the
hotel
told
me
the
same
thing
replied
the
postman
good
my
master
knows
him
said
laurent
to
himself
do
you
know
he
went
on
leering
at
the
postman
i
serve
a
master
who
is
a
rare
man
and
if
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
kiss
the
sole
of
the
foot
of
an
empress
she
would
have
to
give
in
to
him
if
he
had
need
of
you
which
is
what
i
wish
for
you
for
he
is
generous
could
one
count
on
you
lord
monsieur
laurent
my
name
is
moinot
my
name
is
written
exactly
like
magpie
exactly
said
laurent
i
live
at
no
rue
des
trois
freres
on
the
fifth
floor
went
on
moinot
i
have
a
wife
and
four
children
if
what
you
want
of
me
doesn
t
transgress
the
limits
of
my
conscience
and
my
official
duties
you
understand
i
am
your
you
are
an
honest
fellow
said
laurent
shaking
his
hand
paquita
valdes
is
no
doubt
the
mistress
of
the
marquis
de
the
friend
of
king
ferdinand
only
an
old
spanish
mummy
of
eighty
years
is
capable
of
taking
such
precautions
said
henri
when
his
de
had
related
the
result
of
his
researches
monsieur
said
laurent
unless
he
takes
a
balloon
no
one
can
get
into
that
you
are
a
fool
is
it
necessary
to
get
into
the
hotel
to
have
paquita
when
paquita
can
get
out
of
it
but
sir
the
duenna
we
will
shut
her
up
for
a
day
or
two
your
so
we
shall
have
paquita
said
laurent
rubbing
his
hands
rascal
answered
henri
i
shall
condemn
you
to
the
concha
if
you
carry
your
impudence
so
far
as
to
speak
so
of
a
woman
before
she
has
become
mine
turn
your
thoughts
to
dressing
me
i
am
going
henri
remained
for
a
moment
plunged
in
joyous
reflections
let
us
say
it
to
the
praise
of
women
he
obtained
all
those
whom
he
deigned
to
desire
and
what
could
one
think
of
a
woman
having
no
lover
who
should
have
known
how
to
resist
a
young
man
armed
with
beauty
which
is
the
intelligence
of
the
body
with
intelligence
which
is
a
grace
of
the
soul
armed
with
moral
force
and
fortune
which
are
the
only
two
real
powers
yet
in
triumphing
with
such
ease
de
marsay
was
bound
to
grow
weary
of
his
triumphs
thus
for
about
two
years
he
had
grown
very
weary
indeed
and
diving
deep
into
the
sea
of
pleasures
he
brought
back
more
grit
than
pearls
thus
had
he
come
like
potentates
to
implore
of
chance
some
obstacle
to
surmount
some
enterprise
which
should
ask
the
employment
of
his
dormant
moral
and
physical
strength
although
paquita
valdes
presented
him
with
a
marvelous
concentration
of
perfections
which
he
had
only
yet
enjoyed
in
detail
the
attraction
of
passion
was
almost
with
him
constant
satiety
had
weakened
in
his
heart
the
sentiment
of
love
like
old
men
and
people
disillusioned
he
had
no
longer
anything
but
extravagant
caprices
ruinous
tastes
fantasies
which
once
satisfied
left
no
pleasant
memory
in
his
heart
amongst
young
people
love
is
the
finest
of
the
emotions
it
makes
the
life
of
the
soul
blossom
it
nourishes
by
its
solar
power
the
finest
inspirations
and
their
great
thoughts
the
first
fruits
in
all
things
have
a
delicious
savor
amongst
men
love
becomes
a
passion
strength
leads
to
abuse
amongst
old
men
it
turns
to
vice
impotence
tends
to
extremes
henri
was
at
once
an
old
man
a
man
and
a
youth
to
afford
him
the
feelings
of
a
real
love
he
needed
like
lovelace
a
clarissa
harlowe
without
the
magic
lustre
of
that
unattainable
pearl
he
could
only
have
either
passions
rendered
acute
by
some
parisian
vanity
or
set
determinations
with
himself
to
bring
such
and
such
a
woman
to
such
and
such
a
point
of
corruption
or
else
adventures
which
stimulated
his
curiosity
the
report
of
laurent
his
de
had
just
given
an
enormous
value
to
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
it
was
a
question
of
doing
battle
with
some
secret
enemy
who
seemed
as
dangerous
as
he
was
cunning
and
to
carry
off
the
victory
all
the
forces
which
henri
could
dispose
of
would
be
useful
he
was
about
to
play
in
that
eternal
old
comedy
which
will
be
always
fresh
and
the
characters
in
which
are
an
old
man
a
young
girl
and
a
lover
don
hijos
paquita
de
marsay
if
laurent
was
the
equal
of
figaro
the
duenna
seemed
incorruptible
thus
the
living
play
was
supplied
by
chance
with
a
stronger
plot
than
it
had
ever
been
by
dramatic
author
but
then
is
not
chance
too
a
man
of
genius
it
must
be
a
cautious
game
said
henri
to
himself
well
said
paul
de
manerville
as
he
entered
the
room
how
are
we
getting
on
i
have
come
to
breakfast
with
so
be
it
said
henri
you
won
t
be
shocked
if
i
make
my
toilette
before
you
how
absurd
we
take
so
many
things
from
the
english
just
now
that
we
might
well
become
as
great
prudes
and
hypocrites
as
themselves
said
henri
laurent
had
set
before
his
master
such
a
quantity
of
utensils
so
many
different
articles
of
such
elegance
that
paul
could
not
refrain
from
saying
but
you
will
take
a
couple
of
hours
over
that
no
said
henri
two
hours
and
a
well
then
since
we
are
by
ourselves
and
can
say
what
we
like
explain
to
me
why
a
man
as
superior
as
yourself
for
you
are
superior
should
affect
to
exaggerate
a
foppery
which
can
not
be
natural
why
spend
two
hours
and
a
half
in
adorning
yourself
when
it
is
sufficient
to
spend
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
your
bath
to
do
your
hair
in
two
minutes
and
to
dress
there
tell
me
your
i
must
be
very
fond
of
you
my
good
dunce
to
confide
such
high
thoughts
to
you
said
the
young
man
who
was
at
that
moment
having
his
feet
rubbed
with
a
soft
brush
lathered
with
english
soap
have
i
not
the
most
devoted
attachment
to
you
replied
paul
de
manerville
and
do
i
not
like
you
because
i
know
your
superiority
you
must
have
noticed
if
you
are
in
the
least
capable
of
observing
any
moral
fact
that
women
love
fops
went
on
de
marsay
without
replying
in
any
way
to
paul
s
declaration
except
by
a
look
do
you
know
why
women
love
fops
my
friend
fops
are
the
only
men
who
take
care
of
themselves
now
to
take
excessive
care
of
oneself
does
it
not
imply
that
one
takes
care
in
oneself
of
what
belongs
to
another
the
man
who
does
not
belong
to
himself
is
precisely
the
man
on
whom
women
are
keen
love
is
essentially
a
thief
i
say
nothing
about
that
excess
of
niceness
to
which
they
are
so
devoted
do
you
know
of
any
woman
who
has
had
a
passion
for
a
sloven
even
if
he
were
a
remarkable
man
if
such
a
fact
has
occurred
we
must
put
it
to
the
account
of
those
morbid
affections
of
the
breeding
woman
mad
fancies
which
float
through
the
minds
of
everybody
on
the
other
hand
i
have
seen
most
remarkable
people
left
in
the
lurch
because
of
their
carelessness
a
fop
who
is
concerned
about
his
person
is
concerned
with
folly
with
petty
things
and
what
is
a
woman
a
petty
thing
a
bundle
of
follies
with
two
words
said
to
the
winds
can
you
not
make
her
busy
for
four
hours
she
is
sure
that
the
fop
will
be
occupied
with
her
seeing
that
he
has
no
mind
for
great
things
she
will
never
be
neglected
for
glory
ambition
politics
art
those
prostitutes
who
for
her
are
rivals
then
fops
have
the
courage
to
cover
themselves
with
ridicule
in
order
to
please
a
woman
and
her
heart
is
full
of
gratitude
towards
the
man
who
is
ridiculous
for
love
in
fine
a
fop
can
be
no
fop
unless
he
is
right
in
being
one
it
is
women
who
bestow
that
rank
the
fop
is
love
s
colonel
he
has
his
victories
his
regiment
of
women
at
his
command
my
dear
fellow
in
paris
everything
is
known
and
a
man
can
not
be
a
fop
there
you
who
have
only
one
woman
and
who
perhaps
are
right
to
have
but
one
try
to
act
the
fop
you
will
not
even
become
ridiculous
you
will
be
dead
you
will
become
a
foregone
conclusion
one
of
those
men
condemned
inevitably
to
do
one
and
the
same
thing
you
will
come
to
signify
as
inseparably
as
de
la
fayette
signifies
de
talleyrand
desaugiers
de
segur
if
they
once
forsake
their
own
line
people
no
longer
attach
any
value
to
what
they
do
so
foppery
my
friend
paul
is
the
sign
of
an
incontestable
power
over
the
female
folk
a
man
who
is
loved
by
many
women
passes
for
having
superior
qualities
and
then
poor
fellow
it
is
a
question
who
shall
have
him
but
do
you
think
it
is
nothing
to
have
the
right
of
going
into
a
of
looking
down
at
people
from
over
your
cravat
or
through
your
and
of
despising
the
most
superior
of
men
should
he
wear
an
waistcoat
laurent
you
are
hurting
me
after
breakfast
paul
we
will
go
to
the
tuileries
and
see
the
adorable
girl
with
the
golden
when
after
making
an
excellent
meal
the
two
young
men
had
traversed
the
terrasse
de
feuillants
and
the
broad
walk
of
the
tuileries
they
nowhere
discovered
the
sublime
paquita
valdes
on
whose
account
some
fifty
of
the
most
elegant
young
men
in
paris
where
to
be
seen
all
scented
with
their
high
scarfs
spurred
and
booted
riding
walking
talking
laughing
and
damning
themselves
mightily
it
s
a
white
mass
said
henri
but
i
have
the
most
excellent
idea
in
the
world
this
girl
receives
letters
from
london
the
postman
must
be
bought
or
made
drunk
a
letter
opened
read
of
course
and
a
slipped
in
before
it
is
sealed
up
again
the
old
tyrant
is
certain
to
know
the
person
who
writes
the
letters
from
london
and
has
ceased
to
be
suspicious
of
the
day
after
de
marsay
came
again
to
walk
on
the
terrasse
des
feuillants
and
saw
paquita
valdes
already
passion
had
embellished
her
for
him
seriously
he
was
wild
for
those
eyes
whose
rays
seemed
akin
to
those
which
the
sun
emits
and
whose
ardor
set
the
seal
upon
that
of
her
perfect
body
in
which
all
was
delight
de
marsay
was
on
fire
to
brush
the
dress
of
this
enchanting
girl
as
they
passed
one
another
in
their
walk
but
his
attempts
were
always
vain
but
at
one
moment
when
he
had
repassed
paquita
and
the
duenna
in
order
to
find
himself
on
the
same
side
as
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
when
he
returned
paquita
no
less
impatient
came
forward
hurriedly
and
de
marsay
felt
his
hand
pressed
by
her
in
a
fashion
at
once
so
swift
and
so
passionately
significant
that
it
was
as
though
he
had
received
the
emotions
surged
up
in
his
heart
when
the
two
lovers
glanced
at
one
another
paquita
seemed
ashamed
she
dropped
her
eyes
lest
she
should
meet
the
eyes
of
henri
but
her
gaze
sank
lower
to
fasten
on
the
feet
and
form
of
him
whom
women
before
the
revolution
called
i
am
determined
to
make
this
girl
my
mistress
said
henri
to
himself
as
he
followed
her
along
the
terrace
in
the
direction
of
the
place
louis
he
caught
sight
of
the
aged
marquis
de
who
was
walking
on
the
arm
of
his
valet
stepping
with
all
the
precautions
due
to
gout
and
decrepitude
dona
concha
who
distrusted
henri
made
paquita
pass
between
herself
and
the
old
man
oh
for
you
said
de
marsay
to
himself
casting
a
glance
of
disdain
upon
the
duenna
if
one
can
not
make
you
capitulate
with
a
little
opium
one
can
make
you
sleep
we
know
mythology
and
the
fable
of
before
entering
the
carriage
the
girl
exchanged
certain
glances
with
her
lover
of
which
the
meaning
was
unmistakable
and
which
enchanted
henri
but
one
of
them
was
surprised
by
the
duenna
she
said
a
few
rapid
words
to
paquita
who
threw
herself
into
the
with
an
air
of
desperation
for
some
days
paquita
did
not
appear
in
the
tuileries
laurent
who
by
his
master
s
orders
was
on
watch
by
the
hotel
learned
from
the
neighbors
that
neither
the
two
women
nor
the
aged
marquis
had
been
abroad
since
the
day
upon
which
the
duenna
had
surprised
a
glance
between
the
young
girl
in
her
charge
and
henri
the
bond
so
flimsy
withal
which
united
the
two
lovers
was
already
severed
some
days
later
none
knew
by
what
means
de
marsay
had
attained
his
end
he
had
a
seal
and
wax
exactly
resembling
the
seal
and
wax
affixed
to
the
letters
sent
to
mademoiselle
valdes
from
london
paper
similar
to
that
which
her
correspondent
used
moreover
all
the
implements
and
stamps
necessary
to
affix
the
french
and
english
postmarks
he
wrote
the
following
letter
to
which
he
gave
all
the
appearances
of
a
letter
sent
from
london
my
dear
paquita
i
shall
not
try
to
paint
to
you
in
words
the
passion
with
which
you
have
inspired
me
if
to
my
happiness
you
reciprocate
it
understand
that
i
have
found
a
means
of
corresponding
with
you
my
name
is
adolphe
de
gouges
and
i
live
at
no
rue
de
l
universite
if
you
are
too
closely
watched
to
be
able
to
write
to
me
if
you
have
neither
pen
nor
paper
i
shall
understand
it
by
your
silence
if
then
you
have
not
between
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
ten
o
clock
in
the
evening
thrown
a
letter
over
the
wall
of
your
garden
into
that
of
the
baron
de
nucingen
where
it
will
be
waited
for
during
the
whole
of
the
day
a
man
who
is
entirely
devoted
to
me
will
let
down
two
flasks
by
a
string
over
your
wall
at
ten
o
clock
the
next
morning
be
walking
there
at
that
hour
one
of
the
two
flasks
will
contain
opium
to
send
your
argus
to
sleep
it
will
be
sufficient
to
employ
six
drops
the
other
will
contain
ink
the
flask
of
ink
is
of
cut
glass
the
other
is
plain
both
are
of
such
a
size
as
can
easily
be
concealed
within
your
bosom
all
that
i
have
already
done
in
order
to
be
able
to
correspond
with
you
should
tell
you
how
greatly
i
love
you
should
you
have
any
doubt
of
it
i
will
confess
to
you
that
to
obtain
an
interview
of
one
hour
with
you
i
would
give
my
at
least
they
believe
that
poor
creatures
said
de
marsay
but
they
are
right
what
should
we
think
of
a
woman
who
refused
to
be
beguiled
by
a
accompanied
by
such
convincing
accessories
this
letter
was
delivered
by
master
moinot
postman
on
the
following
day
about
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
the
porter
of
the
hotel
in
order
to
be
nearer
to
the
field
of
action
de
marsay
went
and
breakfasted
with
paul
who
lived
in
the
rue
de
la
pepiniere
at
two
o
clock
just
as
the
two
friends
were
laughingly
discussing
the
discomfiture
of
a
young
man
who
had
attempted
to
lead
the
life
of
fashion
without
a
settled
income
and
were
devising
an
end
for
him
henri
s
coachman
came
to
seek
his
master
at
paul
s
house
and
presented
to
him
a
mysterious
personage
who
insisted
on
speaking
himself
with
his
master
this
individual
was
a
mulatto
who
would
assuredly
have
given
talma
a
model
for
the
part
of
othello
if
he
had
come
across
him
never
did
any
african
face
better
express
the
grand
vengefulness
the
ready
suspicion
the
promptitude
in
the
execution
of
a
thought
the
strength
of
the
moor
and
his
childish
lack
of
reflection
his
black
eyes
had
the
fixity
of
the
eyes
of
a
bird
of
prey
and
they
were
framed
like
a
vulture
s
by
a
bluish
membrane
devoid
of
lashes
his
forehead
low
and
narrow
had
something
menacing
evidently
this
man
was
under
the
yoke
of
some
single
and
unique
thought
his
sinewy
arm
did
not
belong
to
him
he
was
followed
by
a
man
whom
the
imaginations
of
all
folk
from
those
who
shiver
in
greenland
to
those
who
sweat
in
the
tropics
would
paint
in
the
single
phrase
was
an
unfortunate
from
this
phrase
everybody
will
conceive
him
according
to
the
special
ideas
of
each
country
but
who
can
best
imagine
his
face
white
and
wrinkled
red
at
the
extremities
and
his
long
beard
who
will
see
his
lean
and
yellow
scarf
his
greasy
his
battered
hat
his
green
frock
coat
his
deplorable
trousers
his
dilapidated
waistcoat
his
imitation
gold
pin
and
battered
shoes
the
strings
of
which
were
plastered
in
mud
who
will
see
all
that
but
the
parisian
the
unfortunate
man
of
paris
is
the
unfortunate
man
for
he
has
still
enough
mirth
to
know
the
extent
of
his
misfortune
the
mulatto
was
like
an
executioner
of
louis
xi
leading
a
man
to
the
gallows
who
has
hunted
us
out
these
two
extraordinary
creatures
said
henri
faith
there
is
one
of
them
who
makes
me
shudder
replied
paul
who
are
you
you
fellow
who
look
the
most
like
a
christian
of
the
two
said
henri
looking
at
the
unfortunate
man
the
mulatto
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
two
young
men
like
a
man
who
understood
nothing
and
who
sought
no
less
to
divine
something
from
the
gestures
and
movements
of
the
lips
i
am
a
public
scribe
and
interpreter
i
live
at
the
palais
de
justice
and
am
named
good
and
this
one
said
henri
to
poincet
looking
towards
the
mulatto
i
do
not
know
he
only
speaks
a
sort
of
spanish
and
he
has
brought
me
here
to
make
himself
understood
by
the
mulatto
drew
from
his
pocket
the
letter
which
henri
had
written
to
paquita
and
handed
it
to
him
henri
threw
it
in
the
fire
ah
so
the
game
is
beginning
said
henri
to
himself
paul
leave
us
alone
for
a
i
translated
this
letter
for
him
went
on
the
interpreter
when
they
were
alone
when
it
was
translated
he
was
in
some
place
which
i
don
t
remember
then
he
came
back
to
look
for
me
and
promised
me
two
to
fetch
him
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
nigger
asked
henri
i
did
not
translate
said
the
interpreter
waiting
for
the
mulatto
s
reply
he
said
sir
went
on
the
interpreter
after
having
listened
to
the
unknown
that
you
must
be
at
ten
night
on
the
boulevard
montmartre
near
the
cafe
you
will
see
a
carriage
there
in
which
you
must
take
your
place
saying
to
the
man
who
will
wait
to
open
the
door
for
you
the
word
a
spanish
word
which
means
added
poincet
casting
a
glance
of
congratulation
upon
henri
the
mulatto
was
about
to
bestow
the
two
but
de
marsay
would
not
permit
it
and
himself
rewarded
the
interpreter
as
he
was
paying
him
the
mulatto
began
to
speak
what
is
he
saying
he
is
warning
me
replied
the
unfortunate
that
if
i
commit
a
single
indiscretion
he
will
strangle
me
he
speaks
fair
and
he
looks
remarkably
as
if
he
were
capable
of
carrying
out
his
i
am
sure
of
it
answered
henri
he
would
keep
his
he
says
as
well
replied
the
interpreter
that
the
person
from
whom
he
is
sent
implores
you
for
your
sake
and
for
hers
to
act
with
the
greatest
prudence
because
the
daggers
which
are
raised
above
your
head
would
strike
your
heart
before
any
human
power
could
save
you
from
he
said
that
so
much
the
better
it
will
be
more
amusing
you
can
come
in
now
paul
he
cried
to
his
friend
the
mulatto
who
had
not
ceased
to
gaze
at
the
lover
of
paquita
valdes
with
magnetic
attention
went
away
followed
by
the
interpreter
well
at
last
i
have
an
adventure
which
is
entirely
romantic
said
henri
when
paul
returned
after
having
shared
in
a
certain
number
i
have
finished
by
finding
in
paris
an
intrigue
accompanied
by
serious
accidents
by
grave
perils
the
deuce
what
courage
danger
gives
a
woman
to
torment
a
woman
to
try
and
contradict
her
doesn
t
it
give
her
the
right
and
the
courage
to
scale
in
one
moment
obstacles
which
it
would
take
her
years
to
surmount
of
herself
pretty
creature
jump
then
to
die
poor
child
daggers
oh
imagination
of
women
they
can
not
help
trying
to
find
authority
for
their
little
jests
besides
can
one
think
of
it
paquita
can
one
think
of
it
my
child
the
devil
take
me
now
that
i
know
this
beautiful
girl
this
masterpiece
of
nature
is
mine
the
adventure
has
lost
its
for
all
his
light
words
the
youth
in
henri
had
reappeared
in
order
to
live
until
the
morrow
without
too
much
pain
he
had
recourse
to
exorbitant
pleasure
he
played
dined
supped
with
his
friends
he
drank
like
a
fish
ate
like
a
german
and
won
ten
or
twelve
thousand
francs
he
left
the
rocher
de
cancale
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
slept
like
a
child
awoke
the
next
morning
fresh
and
rosy
and
dressed
to
go
to
the
tuileries
with
the
intention
of
taking
a
ride
after
having
seen
paquita
in
order
to
get
himself
an
appetite
and
dine
the
better
and
so
kill
the
time
at
the
hour
mentioned
henri
was
on
the
boulevard
saw
the
carriage
and
gave
the
to
a
man
who
looked
to
him
like
the
mulatto
hearing
the
word
the
man
opened
the
door
and
quickly
let
down
the
step
henri
was
so
rapidly
carried
through
paris
and
his
thoughts
left
him
so
little
capacity
to
pay
attention
to
the
streets
through
which
he
passed
that
he
did
not
know
where
the
carriage
stopped
the
mulatto
let
him
into
a
house
the
staircase
of
which
was
quite
close
to
the
entrance
this
staircase
was
dark
as
was
also
the
landing
upon
which
henri
was
obliged
to
wait
while
the
mulatto
was
opening
the
door
of
a
damp
apartment
fetid
and
unlit
the
chambers
of
which
barely
illuminated
by
the
candle
which
his
guide
found
in
the
seemed
to
him
empty
and
ill
furnished
like
those
of
a
house
the
inhabitants
of
which
are
away
he
recognized
the
sensation
which
he
had
experienced
from
the
perusal
of
one
of
those
romances
of
anne
radcliffe
in
which
the
hero
traverses
the
cold
sombre
and
uninhabited
saloons
of
some
sad
and
desert
spot
at
last
the
mulatto
opened
the
door
of
a
the
condition
of
the
old
furniture
and
the
dilapidated
curtains
with
which
the
room
was
adorned
gave
it
the
air
of
the
of
a
house
of
ill
fame
there
was
the
same
pretension
to
elegance
and
the
same
collection
of
things
in
bad
taste
of
dust
and
dirt
upon
a
sofa
covered
with
red
utrecht
velvet
by
the
side
of
a
smoking
hearth
the
fire
of
which
was
buried
in
ashes
sat
an
old
poorly
dressed
woman
her
head
capped
by
one
of
those
turbans
which
english
women
of
a
certain
age
have
invented
and
which
would
have
a
mighty
success
in
china
where
the
artist
s
ideal
is
the
monstrous
the
room
the
old
woman
the
cold
hearth
all
would
have
chilled
love
to
death
had
not
paquita
been
there
upon
an
ottoman
in
a
loose
voluptuous
wrapper
free
to
scatter
her
gaze
of
gold
and
flame
free
to
show
her
arched
foot
free
of
her
luminous
movements
this
first
interview
was
what
every
must
be
between
persons
of
passionate
disposition
who
have
stepped
over
a
wide
distance
quickly
who
desire
each
other
ardently
and
who
nevertheless
do
not
know
each
other
it
is
impossible
that
at
first
there
should
not
occur
certain
discordant
notes
in
the
situation
which
is
embarrassing
until
the
moment
when
two
souls
find
themselves
in
unison
if
desire
gives
a
man
boldness
and
disposes
him
to
lay
restraint
aside
the
mistress
under
pain
of
ceasing
to
be
woman
however
great
may
be
her
love
is
afraid
of
arriving
at
the
end
so
promptly
and
face
to
face
with
the
necessity
of
giving
herself
which
to
many
women
is
equivalent
to
a
fall
into
an
abyss
at
the
bottom
of
which
they
know
not
what
they
shall
find
the
involuntary
coldness
of
the
woman
contrasts
with
her
confessed
passion
and
necessarily
reacts
upon
the
most
passionate
lover
thus
ideas
which
often
float
around
souls
like
vapors
determine
in
them
a
sort
of
temporary
malady
in
the
sweet
journey
which
two
beings
undertake
through
the
fair
domains
of
love
this
moment
is
like
a
waste
land
to
be
traversed
a
land
without
a
tree
alternatively
damp
and
warm
full
of
scorching
sand
traversed
by
marshes
which
leads
to
smiling
groves
clad
with
roses
where
love
and
his
retinue
of
pleasures
disport
themselves
on
carpets
of
soft
verdure
often
the
witty
man
finds
himself
afflicted
with
a
foolish
laugh
which
is
his
only
answer
to
everything
his
wit
is
as
it
were
suffocated
beneath
the
icy
pressure
of
his
desires
it
would
not
be
impossible
for
two
beings
of
equal
beauty
intelligence
and
passion
to
utter
at
first
nothing
but
the
most
silly
commonplaces
until
chance
a
word
the
tremor
of
a
certain
glance
the
communication
of
a
spark
should
have
brought
them
to
the
happy
transition
which
leads
to
that
flowery
way
in
which
one
does
not
walk
but
where
one
sways
and
at
the
same
time
does
not
lapse
such
a
state
of
mind
is
always
in
proportion
with
the
violence
of
the
feeling
two
creatures
who
love
one
another
weakly
feel
nothing
similar
the
effect
of
this
crisis
can
even
be
compared
with
that
which
is
produced
by
the
glow
of
a
clear
sky
nature
at
the
first
view
appears
to
be
covered
with
a
gauze
veil
the
azure
of
the
firmament
seems
black
the
intensity
of
light
is
like
darkness
with
henri
as
with
the
spanish
girl
there
was
an
equal
intensity
of
feeling
and
that
law
of
statics
in
virtue
of
which
two
identical
forces
cancel
each
other
might
have
been
true
also
in
the
moral
order
and
the
embarrassment
of
the
moment
was
singularly
increased
by
the
presence
of
the
old
hag
love
takes
pleasure
or
fright
at
all
all
has
meaning
for
it
everything
is
an
omen
of
happiness
or
sorrow
for
it
this
decrepit
woman
was
there
like
a
suggestion
of
catastrophe
and
represented
the
horrid
fish
s
tail
with
which
the
allegorical
geniuses
of
greece
have
terminated
their
chimeras
and
sirens
whose
figures
like
all
passions
are
so
seductive
so
deceptive
although
henri
was
not
a
the
phrase
is
always
a
mockery
but
a
man
of
extraordinary
power
a
man
as
great
as
a
man
can
be
without
faith
the
conjunction
struck
him
moreover
the
strongest
men
are
naturally
the
most
impressionable
and
consequently
the
most
superstitious
if
indeed
one
may
call
superstition
the
prejudice
of
the
first
thoughts
which
without
doubt
is
the
appreciation
of
the
result
in
causes
hidden
to
other
eyes
but
perceptible
to
their
own
the
spanish
girl
profited
by
this
moment
of
stupefaction
to
let
herself
fall
into
the
ecstasy
of
that
infinite
adoration
which
seizes
the
heart
of
a
woman
when
she
truly
loves
and
finds
herself
in
the
presence
of
an
idol
for
whom
she
has
vainly
longed
her
eyes
were
all
joy
all
happiness
and
sparks
flew
from
them
she
was
under
the
charm
and
fearlessly
intoxicated
herself
with
a
felicity
of
which
she
had
dreamed
long
she
seemed
then
so
marvelously
beautiful
to
henri
that
all
this
phantasmagoria
of
rags
and
old
age
of
worn
red
drapery
and
of
the
green
mats
in
front
of
the
armchairs
the
red
tiles
all
this
sick
and
dilapidated
luxury
disappeared
the
room
seemed
lit
up
and
it
was
only
through
a
cloud
that
one
could
see
the
fearful
harpy
fixed
and
dumb
on
her
red
sofa
her
yellow
eyes
betraying
the
servile
sentiments
inspired
by
misfortune
or
caused
by
some
vice
beneath
whose
servitude
one
has
fallen
as
beneath
a
tyrant
who
brutalizes
one
with
the
flagellations
of
his
despotism
her
eyes
had
the
cold
glitter
of
a
caged
tiger
knowing
his
impotence
and
being
compelled
to
swallow
his
rage
of
destruction
who
is
that
woman
said
henri
to
paquita
but
paquita
did
not
answer
she
made
a
sign
that
she
understood
no
french
and
asked
henri
if
he
spoke
english
de
marsay
repeated
his
question
in
english
she
is
the
only
woman
in
whom
i
can
confide
although
she
has
sold
me
already
said
paquita
tranquilly
my
dear
adolphe
she
is
my
mother
a
slave
bought
in
georgia
for
her
rare
beauty
little
enough
of
which
remains
she
only
speaks
her
native
the
attitude
of
this
woman
and
her
eagerness
to
guess
from
the
gestures
of
her
daughter
and
henri
what
was
passing
between
them
were
suddenly
explained
to
the
young
man
and
this
explanation
put
him
at
his
ease
paquita
he
said
are
we
never
to
be
free
then
never
she
said
with
an
air
of
sadness
even
now
we
have
but
a
few
days
before
she
lowered
her
eyes
looked
at
and
counted
with
her
right
hand
on
the
fingers
of
her
left
revealing
so
the
most
beautiful
hands
which
henri
had
ever
seen
one
two
three
she
counted
up
to
twelve
yes
she
said
we
have
twelve
and
after
after
she
said
showing
the
absorption
of
a
weak
woman
before
the
executioner
s
axe
and
slain
in
advance
as
it
were
by
a
fear
which
stripped
her
of
that
magnificent
energy
which
nature
seemed
to
have
bestowed
upon
her
only
to
aggrandize
pleasure
and
convert
the
most
vulgar
delights
into
endless
poems
after
she
repeated
her
eyes
took
a
fixed
stare
she
seemed
to
contemplate
a
threatening
object
far
away
i
do
not
know
she
said
this
girl
is
mad
said
henri
to
himself
falling
into
strange
reflections
paquita
appeared
to
him
occupied
by
something
which
was
not
himself
like
a
woman
constrained
equally
by
remorse
and
passion
perhaps
she
had
in
her
heart
another
love
which
she
alternately
remembered
and
forgot
in
a
moment
henri
was
assailed
by
a
thousand
contradictory
thoughts
this
girl
became
a
mystery
for
him
but
as
he
contemplated
her
with
the
scientific
attention
of
the
man
famished
for
new
pleasures
like
that
eastern
king
who
asked
that
a
pleasure
should
be
created
for
him
a
horrible
thirst
with
which
great
souls
are
seized
henri
recognized
in
paquita
the
richest
organization
that
nature
had
ever
deigned
to
compose
for
love
the
presumptive
play
of
this
machinery
setting
aside
the
soul
would
have
frightened
any
other
man
than
henri
but
he
was
fascinated
by
that
rich
harvest
of
promised
pleasures
by
that
constant
variety
in
happiness
the
dream
of
every
man
and
the
desire
of
every
loving
woman
too
he
was
infuriated
by
the
infinite
rendered
palpable
and
transported
into
the
most
excessive
raptures
of
which
the
creature
is
capable
all
that
he
saw
in
this
girl
more
distinctly
than
he
had
yet
seen
it
for
she
let
herself
be
viewed
complacently
happy
to
be
admired
the
admiration
of
de
marsay
became
a
secret
fury
and
he
unveiled
her
completely
throwing
a
glance
at
her
which
the
spaniard
understood
as
though
she
had
been
used
to
receive
such
if
you
are
not
to
be
mine
mine
only
i
will
kill
you
he
cried
hearing
this
speech
paquita
covered
her
face
in
her
hands
and
cried
naively
holy
virgin
what
have
i
brought
upon
myself
she
rose
flung
herself
down
upon
the
red
sofa
and
buried
her
head
in
the
rags
which
covered
the
bosom
of
her
mother
and
wept
there
the
old
woman
received
her
daughter
without
issuing
from
her
state
of
immobility
or
displaying
any
emotion
the
mother
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
that
gravity
of
savage
races
the
impassiveness
of
a
statue
upon
which
all
remarks
are
lost
did
she
or
did
she
not
love
her
daughter
beneath
that
mask
every
human
emotion
might
brood
good
and
evil
and
from
this
creature
all
might
be
expected
her
gaze
passed
slowly
from
her
daughter
s
beautiful
hair
which
covered
her
like
a
mantle
to
the
face
of
henri
which
she
considered
with
an
indescribable
curiosity
she
seemed
to
ask
by
what
fatality
he
was
there
from
what
caprice
nature
had
made
so
seductive
a
man
these
women
are
making
sport
of
me
said
henri
to
himself
at
that
moment
paquita
raised
her
head
cast
at
him
one
of
those
looks
which
reach
the
very
soul
and
consume
it
so
beautiful
seemed
she
that
he
swore
he
would
possess
such
a
treasure
of
beauty
my
paquita
be
mine
wouldst
thou
kill
me
she
said
fearfully
palpitating
and
anxious
but
drawn
towards
him
by
an
inexplicable
force
kill
thee
i
he
said
smiling
paquita
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
said
a
word
to
the
old
woman
who
authoritatively
seized
henri
s
hand
and
that
of
her
daughter
she
gazed
at
them
for
a
long
time
and
then
released
them
wagging
her
head
in
a
fashion
horribly
significant
be
mine
this
evening
this
moment
follow
me
do
not
leave
me
it
must
be
paquita
dost
thou
love
me
come
in
a
moment
he
had
poured
out
a
thousand
foolish
words
to
her
with
the
rapidity
of
a
torrent
coursing
between
the
rocks
and
repeating
the
same
sound
in
a
thousand
different
forms
it
is
the
same
voice
said
paquita
in
a
melancholy
voice
which
de
marsay
could
not
overhear
and
the
same
ardor
she
added
so
be
it
yes
she
said
with
an
abandonment
of
passion
which
no
words
can
describe
yes
but
not
adolphe
i
gave
too
little
opium
to
la
concha
she
might
wake
up
and
i
should
be
lost
at
this
moment
the
whole
household
believes
me
to
be
asleep
in
my
room
in
two
days
be
at
the
same
spot
say
the
same
word
to
the
same
man
that
man
is
my
cristemio
worships
me
and
would
die
in
torments
for
me
before
they
could
extract
one
word
against
me
from
him
farewell
she
said
seizing
henri
by
the
waist
and
twining
round
him
like
a
serpent
she
pressed
him
on
every
side
at
once
lifted
her
head
to
his
and
offered
him
her
lips
then
snatched
a
kiss
which
filled
them
both
with
such
a
dizziness
that
it
seemed
to
henri
as
though
the
earth
opened
and
paquita
cried
enough
depart
in
a
voice
which
told
how
little
she
was
mistress
of
herself
but
she
clung
to
him
still
still
crying
depart
and
brought
him
slowly
to
the
staircase
there
the
mulatto
whose
white
eyes
lit
up
at
the
sight
of
paquita
took
the
torch
from
the
hands
of
his
idol
and
conducted
henri
to
the
street
he
left
the
light
under
the
arch
opened
the
door
put
henri
into
the
carriage
and
set
him
down
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
with
marvelous
rapidity
it
was
as
though
the
horses
had
in
their
veins
the
scene
was
like
a
dream
to
de
marsay
but
one
of
those
dreams
which
even
when
they
fade
away
leave
a
feeling
of
supernatural
voluptuousness
which
a
man
runs
after
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
a
single
kiss
had
been
enough
never
had
been
spent
in
a
manner
more
decorous
or
chaste
or
perhaps
more
coldly
in
a
spot
of
which
the
surroundings
were
more
gruesome
in
presence
of
a
more
hideous
divinity
for
the
mother
had
remained
in
henri
s
imagination
like
some
infernal
cowering
thing
cadaverous
monstrous
savagely
ferocious
which
the
imagination
of
poets
and
painters
had
not
yet
conceived
in
effect
no
had
ever
irritated
his
senses
more
revealed
more
audacious
pleasures
or
better
aroused
love
from
its
centre
to
shed
itself
round
him
like
an
atmosphere
there
was
something
sombre
mysterious
sweet
tender
constrained
and
expansive
an
intermingling
of
the
awful
and
the
celestial
of
paradise
and
hell
which
made
de
marsay
like
a
drunken
man
he
was
no
longer
himself
and
he
was
withal
great
enough
to
be
able
to
resist
the
intoxication
of
pleasure
in
order
to
render
his
conduct
intelligible
in
the
catastrophe
of
this
story
it
is
needful
to
explain
how
his
soul
had
broadened
at
an
age
when
young
men
generally
belittle
themselves
in
their
relations
with
women
or
in
too
much
occupation
with
them
its
growth
was
due
to
a
concurrence
of
secret
circumstances
which
invested
him
with
a
vast
and
unsuspected
power
this
young
man
held
in
his
hand
a
sceptre
more
powerful
than
that
of
modern
kings
almost
all
of
whom
are
curbed
in
their
least
wishes
by
the
laws
de
marsay
exercised
the
autocratic
power
of
an
oriental
despot
but
this
power
so
stupidly
put
into
execution
in
asia
by
brutish
men
was
increased
tenfold
by
its
conjunction
with
european
intelligence
with
french
wit
the
most
subtle
the
keenest
of
all
intellectual
instruments
henri
could
do
what
he
would
in
the
interest
of
his
pleasures
and
vanities
this
invisible
action
upon
the
social
world
had
invested
him
with
a
real
but
secret
majesty
without
emphasis
and
deriving
from
himself
he
had
not
the
opinion
which
louis
xiv
could
have
of
himself
but
that
which
the
proudest
of
the
caliphs
the
pharoahs
the
xerxes
who
held
themselves
to
be
of
divine
origin
had
of
themselves
when
they
imitated
god
and
veiled
themselves
from
their
subjects
under
the
pretext
that
their
looks
dealt
forth
death
thus
without
any
remorse
at
being
at
once
the
judge
and
the
accuser
de
marsay
coldly
condemned
to
death
the
man
or
the
woman
who
had
seriously
offended
him
although
often
pronounced
almost
lightly
the
verdict
was
irrevocable
an
error
was
a
misfortune
similar
to
that
which
a
thunderbolt
causes
when
it
falls
upon
a
smiling
parisienne
in
some
hackney
coach
instead
of
crushing
the
old
coachman
who
is
driving
her
to
a
thus
the
bitter
and
profound
sarcasm
which
distinguished
the
young
man
s
conversation
usually
tended
to
frighten
people
no
one
was
anxious
to
put
him
out
women
are
prodigiously
fond
of
those
persons
who
call
themselves
pashas
and
who
are
as
it
were
accompanied
by
lions
and
executioners
and
who
walk
in
a
panoply
of
terror
the
result
in
the
case
of
such
men
is
a
security
of
action
a
certitude
of
power
a
pride
of
gaze
a
leonine
consciousness
which
makes
women
realize
the
type
of
strength
of
which
they
all
dream
such
was
de
marsay
happy
for
the
moment
with
his
future
he
grew
young
and
pliable
and
thought
of
nothing
but
love
as
he
went
to
bed
he
dreamed
of
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
as
the
young
and
passionate
can
dream
his
dreams
were
monstrous
images
unattainable
extravagances
full
of
light
revealing
invisible
worlds
yet
in
a
manner
always
incomplete
for
an
intervening
veil
changes
the
conditions
of
vision
for
the
next
and
succeeding
day
henri
disappeared
and
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
him
his
power
only
belonged
to
him
under
certain
conditions
and
happily
for
him
during
those
two
days
he
was
a
private
soldier
in
the
service
of
the
demon
to
whom
he
owed
his
talismanic
existence
but
at
the
appointed
time
in
the
evening
he
was
waiting
and
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
carriage
the
mulatto
approached
henri
in
order
to
repeat
to
him
in
french
a
phrase
which
he
seemed
to
have
learned
by
heart
if
you
wish
to
come
she
told
me
you
must
consent
to
have
your
eyes
and
cristemio
produced
a
white
silk
handkerchief
no
said
henri
whose
omnipotence
revolted
suddenly
he
tried
to
leap
in
the
mulatto
made
a
sign
and
the
carriage
drove
off
yes
cried
de
marsay
furious
at
the
thought
of
losing
a
piece
of
good
fortune
which
had
been
promised
him
he
saw
moreover
the
impossibility
of
making
terms
with
a
slave
whose
obedience
was
as
blind
as
the
hangman
s
nor
was
it
this
passive
instrument
upon
whom
his
anger
could
fall
the
mulatto
whistled
the
carriage
returned
henri
got
in
hastily
already
a
few
curious
onlookers
had
assembled
like
sheep
on
the
boulevard
henri
was
strong
he
tried
to
play
the
mulatto
when
the
carriage
started
at
a
gallop
he
seized
his
hands
in
order
to
master
him
and
retain
by
subduing
his
attendant
the
possession
of
his
faculties
so
that
he
might
know
whither
he
was
going
it
was
a
vain
attempt
the
eyes
of
the
mulatto
flashed
from
the
darkness
the
fellow
uttered
a
cry
which
his
fury
stifled
in
his
throat
released
himself
threw
back
de
marsay
with
a
hand
like
iron
and
nailed
him
so
to
speak
to
the
bottom
of
the
carriage
then
with
his
free
hand
he
drew
a
triangular
dagger
and
whistled
the
coachman
heard
the
whistle
and
stopped
henri
was
unarmed
he
was
forced
to
yield
he
moved
his
head
towards
the
handkerchief
the
gesture
of
submission
calmed
cristemio
and
he
bound
his
eyes
with
a
respect
and
care
which
manifested
a
sort
of
veneration
for
the
person
of
the
man
whom
his
idol
loved
but
before
taking
this
course
he
had
placed
his
dagger
distrustfully
in
his
side
pocket
and
buttoned
himself
up
to
the
chin
that
nigger
would
have
killed
me
said
de
marsay
to
himself
once
more
the
carriage
moved
on
rapidly
there
was
one
resource
still
open
to
a
young
man
who
knew
paris
as
well
as
henri
to
know
whither
he
was
going
he
had
but
to
collect
himself
and
count
by
the
number
of
gutters
crossed
the
streets
leading
from
the
boulevards
by
which
the
carriage
passed
so
long
as
it
continued
straight
along
he
could
thus
discover
into
which
lateral
street
it
would
turn
either
towards
the
seine
or
towards
the
heights
of
montmartre
and
guess
the
name
or
position
of
the
street
in
which
his
guide
should
bring
him
to
a
halt
but
the
violent
emotion
which
his
struggle
had
caused
him
the
rage
into
which
his
compromised
dignity
had
thrown
him
the
ideas
of
vengeance
to
which
he
abandoned
himself
the
suppositions
suggested
to
him
by
the
circumstantial
care
which
this
girl
had
taken
in
order
to
bring
him
to
her
all
hindered
him
from
the
attention
which
the
blind
have
necessary
for
the
concentration
of
his
intelligence
and
the
perfect
lucidity
of
his
recollection
the
journey
lasted
half
an
hour
when
the
carriage
stopped
it
was
no
longer
on
the
street
the
mulatto
and
the
coachman
took
henri
in
their
arms
lifted
him
out
and
putting
him
into
a
sort
of
litter
conveyed
him
across
a
garden
he
could
smell
its
flowers
and
the
perfume
peculiar
to
trees
and
grass
the
silence
which
reigned
there
was
so
profound
that
he
could
distinguish
the
noise
made
by
the
drops
of
water
falling
from
the
moist
leaves
the
two
men
took
him
to
a
staircase
set
him
on
his
feet
led
him
by
his
hands
through
several
apartments
and
left
him
in
a
room
whose
atmosphere
was
perfumed
and
the
thick
carpet
of
which
he
could
feel
beneath
his
feet
a
woman
s
hand
pushed
him
on
to
a
divan
and
untied
the
handkerchief
for
him
henri
saw
paquita
before
him
but
paquita
in
all
her
womanly
and
voluptuous
glory
the
section
of
the
boudoir
in
which
henri
found
himself
described
a
circular
line
softly
gracious
which
was
faced
opposite
by
the
other
perfectly
square
half
in
the
midst
of
which
a
shone
of
gold
and
white
marble
he
had
entered
by
a
door
on
one
side
hidden
by
a
rich
tapestried
screen
opposite
which
was
a
window
the
semicircular
portion
was
adorned
with
a
real
turkish
divan
that
is
to
say
a
mattress
thrown
on
the
ground
but
a
mattress
as
broad
as
a
bed
a
divan
fifty
feet
in
circumference
made
of
white
cashmere
relieved
by
bows
of
black
and
scarlet
silk
arranged
in
panels
the
top
of
this
huge
bed
was
raised
several
inches
by
numerous
cushions
which
further
enriched
it
by
their
tasteful
comfort
the
boudoir
was
lined
with
some
red
stuff
over
which
an
indian
muslin
was
stretched
fluted
after
the
fashion
of
corinthian
columns
in
plaits
going
in
and
out
and
bound
at
the
top
and
bottom
by
bands
of
stuff
on
which
were
designs
in
black
arabesque
below
the
muslin
the
poppy
turned
to
rose
that
amorous
color
which
was
matched
by
which
were
of
indian
muslin
lined
with
taffeta
and
set
off
with
a
fringe
of
and
black
six
arms
each
supporting
two
candles
were
attached
to
the
tapestry
at
an
equal
distance
to
illuminate
the
divan
the
ceiling
from
the
middle
of
which
a
lustre
of
unpolished
silver
hung
was
of
a
brilliant
whiteness
and
the
cornice
was
gilded
the
carpet
was
like
an
oriental
shawl
it
had
the
designs
and
recalled
the
poetry
of
persia
where
the
hands
of
slaves
had
worked
on
it
the
furniture
was
covered
in
white
cashmere
relieved
by
black
and
ornaments
the
clock
the
candelabra
all
were
in
white
marble
and
gold
the
only
table
there
had
a
cloth
of
cashmere
elegant
held
roses
of
every
kind
flowers
white
or
red
in
fine
the
least
detail
seemed
to
have
been
the
object
of
loving
thought
never
had
richness
hidden
itself
more
coquettishly
to
become
elegance
to
express
grace
to
inspire
pleasure
everything
there
would
have
warmed
the
coldest
of
beings
the
caresses
of
the
tapestry
of
which
the
color
changed
according
to
the
direction
of
one
s
gaze
becoming
either
all
white
or
all
rose
harmonized
with
the
effects
of
the
light
shed
upon
the
diaphanous
tissues
of
the
muslin
which
produced
an
appearance
of
mistiness
the
soul
has
i
know
not
what
attraction
towards
white
love
delights
in
red
and
the
passions
are
flattered
by
gold
which
has
the
power
of
realizing
their
caprices
thus
all
that
man
possesses
within
him
of
vague
and
mysterious
all
his
inexplicable
affinities
were
caressed
in
their
involuntary
sympathies
there
was
in
this
perfect
harmony
a
concert
of
color
to
which
the
soul
responded
with
vague
and
voluptuous
and
fluctuating
ideas
it
was
out
of
a
misty
atmosphere
laden
with
exquisite
perfumes
that
paquita
clad
in
a
white
wrapper
her
feet
bare
orange
blossoms
in
her
black
hair
appeared
to
henri
knelt
before
him
adoring
him
as
the
god
of
this
temple
whither
he
had
deigned
to
come
although
de
marsay
was
accustomed
to
seeing
the
utmost
efforts
of
parisian
luxury
he
was
surprised
at
the
aspect
of
this
shell
like
that
from
which
venus
rose
out
of
the
sea
whether
from
an
effect
of
contrast
between
the
darkness
from
which
he
issued
and
the
light
which
bathed
his
soul
whether
from
a
comparison
which
he
swiftly
made
between
this
scene
and
that
of
their
first
interview
he
experienced
one
of
those
delicate
sensations
which
true
poetry
gives
perceiving
in
the
midst
of
this
retreat
which
had
been
opened
to
him
as
by
a
fairy
s
magic
wand
the
masterpiece
of
creation
this
girl
whose
warmly
colored
tints
whose
soft
skin
soft
but
slightly
gilded
by
the
shadows
by
i
know
not
what
vaporous
effusion
of
love
gleamed
as
though
it
reflected
the
rays
of
color
and
light
his
anger
his
desire
for
vengeance
his
wounded
vanity
all
were
lost
like
an
eagle
darting
on
his
prey
he
took
her
utterly
to
him
set
her
on
his
knees
and
felt
with
an
indescribable
intoxication
the
voluptuous
pressure
of
this
girl
whose
richly
developed
beauties
softly
enveloped
him
come
to
me
paquita
he
said
in
a
low
voice
speak
speak
without
fear
she
said
this
retreat
was
built
for
love
no
sound
can
escape
from
it
so
greatly
was
it
desired
to
guard
avariciously
the
accents
and
music
of
the
beloved
voice
however
loud
should
be
the
cries
they
would
not
be
heard
without
these
walls
a
person
might
be
murdered
and
his
moans
would
be
as
vain
as
if
he
were
in
the
midst
of
the
great
who
has
understood
jealousy
and
its
needs
so
well
never
question
me
as
to
that
she
answered
untying
with
a
gesture
of
wonderful
sweetness
the
young
man
s
scarf
doubtless
in
order
the
better
to
behold
his
neck
yes
there
is
the
neck
i
love
so
well
she
said
wouldst
thou
please
me
this
interrogation
rendered
by
the
accent
almost
lascivious
drew
de
marsay
from
the
reverie
in
which
he
had
been
plunged
by
paquita
s
authoritative
refusal
to
allow
him
any
research
as
to
the
unknown
being
who
hovered
like
a
shadow
about
them
and
if
i
wished
to
know
who
reigns
here
paquita
looked
at
him
trembling
it
is
not
i
then
he
said
rising
and
freeing
himself
from
the
girl
whose
head
fell
backwards
where
i
am
i
would
be
strike
strike
said
the
poor
slave
a
prey
to
terror
for
what
do
you
take
me
then
will
you
answer
paquita
got
up
gently
her
eyes
full
of
tears
took
a
poniard
from
one
of
the
two
ebony
pieces
of
furniture
and
presented
it
to
henri
with
a
gesture
of
submission
which
would
have
moved
a
tiger
give
me
a
feast
such
as
men
give
when
they
love
she
said
and
whilst
i
sleep
slay
me
for
i
know
not
how
to
answer
thee
hearken
i
am
bound
like
some
poor
beast
to
a
stake
i
am
amazed
that
i
have
been
able
to
throw
a
bridge
over
the
abyss
which
divides
us
intoxicate
me
then
kill
me
ah
no
no
she
cried
joining
her
hands
do
not
kill
me
i
love
life
life
is
fair
to
me
if
i
am
a
slave
i
am
a
queen
too
i
could
beguile
you
with
words
tell
you
that
i
love
you
alone
prove
it
to
you
profit
by
my
momentary
empire
to
say
to
you
take
me
as
one
tastes
the
perfume
of
a
flower
when
one
passes
it
in
a
king
s
then
after
having
used
the
cunning
eloquence
of
woman
and
soared
on
the
wings
of
pleasure
after
having
quenched
my
thirst
i
could
have
you
cast
into
a
pit
where
none
could
find
you
which
has
been
made
to
gratify
vengeance
without
having
to
fear
that
of
the
law
a
pit
full
of
lime
which
would
kindle
and
consume
you
until
no
particle
of
you
were
left
you
would
stay
in
my
heart
mine
henri
looked
at
the
girl
without
trembling
and
this
fearless
gaze
filled
her
with
joy
no
i
shall
not
do
it
you
have
fallen
into
no
trap
here
but
upon
the
heart
of
a
woman
who
adores
you
and
it
is
i
who
will
be
cast
into
the
all
this
appears
to
me
prodigiously
strange
said
de
marsay
considering
her
but
you
seem
to
me
a
good
girl
a
strange
nature
you
are
upon
my
word
of
honor
a
living
riddle
the
answer
to
which
is
very
difficult
to
paquita
understood
nothing
of
what
the
young
man
said
she
looked
at
him
gently
opening
wide
eyes
which
could
never
be
stupid
so
much
was
pleasure
written
in
them
come
then
my
love
she
said
returning
to
her
first
idea
wouldst
thou
please
me
i
would
do
all
that
thou
wouldst
and
even
that
thou
wouldst
not
answered
de
marsay
with
a
laugh
he
had
recovered
his
foppish
ease
as
he
took
the
resolve
to
let
himself
go
to
the
climax
of
his
good
fortune
looking
neither
before
nor
after
perhaps
he
counted
moreover
on
his
power
and
his
capacity
of
a
man
used
to
adventures
to
dominate
this
girl
a
few
hours
later
and
learn
all
her
secrets
well
said
she
let
me
arrange
you
as
i
would
paquita
went
joyously
and
took
from
one
of
the
two
chests
a
robe
of
red
velvet
in
which
she
dressed
de
marsay
then
adorned
his
head
with
a
woman
s
bonnet
and
wrapped
a
shawl
round
him
abandoning
herself
to
these
follies
with
a
child
s
innocence
she
laughed
a
convulsive
laugh
and
resembled
some
bird
flapping
its
wings
but
he
saw
nothing
beyond
if
it
be
impossible
to
paint
the
delights
which
these
two
creatures
made
by
heaven
in
a
joyous
moment
found
it
is
perhaps
necessary
to
translate
metaphysically
the
extraordinary
and
almost
fantastic
impressions
of
the
young
man
that
which
persons
in
the
social
position
of
de
marsay
living
as
he
lived
are
best
able
to
recognize
is
a
girl
s
innocence
but
strange
phenomenon
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
might
be
virgin
but
innocent
she
was
certainly
not
the
fantastic
union
of
the
mysterious
and
the
real
of
darkness
and
light
horror
and
beauty
pleasure
and
danger
paradise
and
hell
which
had
already
been
met
with
in
this
adventure
was
resumed
in
the
capricious
and
sublime
being
with
which
de
marsay
dallied
all
the
utmost
science
or
the
most
refined
pleasure
all
that
henri
could
know
of
that
poetry
of
the
senses
which
is
called
love
was
excelled
by
the
treasures
poured
forth
by
this
girl
whose
radiant
eyes
gave
the
lie
to
none
of
the
promises
which
they
made
she
was
an
oriental
poem
in
which
shone
the
sun
that
saadi
that
hafiz
have
set
in
their
pulsing
strophes
only
neither
the
rhythm
of
saadi
nor
that
of
pindar
could
have
expressed
the
ecstasy
full
of
confusion
and
stupefaction
which
seized
the
delicious
girl
when
the
error
in
which
an
iron
hand
had
caused
her
to
live
was
at
an
end
dead
she
said
i
am
dead
adolphe
take
me
away
to
the
world
s
end
to
an
island
where
no
one
knows
us
let
there
be
no
traces
of
our
flight
we
should
be
followed
to
the
gates
of
hell
god
here
is
the
day
escape
shall
i
ever
see
you
again
yes
i
will
see
you
if
i
have
to
deal
death
to
all
my
warders
to
have
that
joy
till
she
pressed
him
in
her
arms
with
an
embrace
in
which
the
terror
of
death
mingled
then
she
touched
a
spring
which
must
have
been
in
connection
with
a
bell
and
implored
de
marsay
to
permit
his
eyes
to
be
bandaged
and
if
i
would
not
and
if
i
wished
to
stay
here
you
would
be
the
death
of
me
more
speedily
she
said
for
now
i
know
i
am
certain
to
die
on
your
henri
submitted
in
the
man
who
had
just
gorged
himself
with
pleasure
there
occurs
a
propensity
to
forgetfulness
i
know
not
what
ingratitude
a
desire
for
liberty
a
whim
to
go
elsewhere
a
tinge
of
contempt
and
perhaps
of
disgust
for
his
idol
in
fine
indescribable
sentiments
which
render
him
ignoble
and
ashamed
the
certainty
of
this
confused
but
real
feeling
in
souls
who
are
not
illuminated
by
that
celestial
light
nor
perfumed
with
that
holy
essence
from
which
the
performance
of
sentiment
springs
doubtless
suggested
to
rousseau
the
adventures
of
lord
edward
which
conclude
the
letters
of
the
if
rousseau
is
obviously
inspired
by
the
work
of
richardson
he
departs
from
it
in
a
thousand
details
which
leave
his
achievement
magnificently
original
he
has
recommended
it
to
posterity
by
great
ideas
which
it
is
difficult
to
liberate
by
analysis
when
in
one
s
youth
one
reads
this
work
with
the
object
of
finding
in
it
the
lurid
representation
of
the
most
physical
of
our
feelings
whereas
serious
and
philosophical
writers
never
employ
its
images
except
as
the
consequence
or
the
corollary
of
a
vast
thought
and
the
adventures
of
lord
edward
are
one
of
the
most
europeanly
delicate
ideas
of
the
whole
work
henri
therefore
found
himself
beneath
the
domination
of
that
confused
sentiment
which
is
unknown
to
true
love
there
was
needful
in
some
sort
the
persuasive
grip
of
comparisons
and
the
irresistible
attraction
of
memories
to
lead
him
back
to
a
woman
true
love
rules
above
all
through
recollection
a
woman
who
is
not
engraven
upon
the
soul
by
excess
of
pleasure
or
by
strength
of
emotion
how
can
she
ever
be
loved
in
henri
s
case
paquita
had
established
herself
by
both
of
these
reasons
but
at
this
moment
seized
as
he
was
by
the
satiety
of
his
happiness
that
delicious
melancholy
of
the
body
he
could
hardly
analyze
his
heart
even
by
recalling
to
his
lips
the
taste
of
the
liveliest
gratifications
that
he
had
ever
grasped
he
found
himself
on
the
boulevard
montmartre
at
the
break
of
day
gazed
stupidly
at
the
retreating
carriage
produced
two
cigars
from
his
pocket
lit
one
from
the
lantern
of
a
good
woman
who
sold
brandy
and
coffee
to
workmen
and
street
arabs
and
chestnut
venders
to
all
the
parisian
populace
which
begins
its
work
before
daybreak
then
he
went
off
smoking
his
cigar
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
with
a
air
which
did
him
small
honor
what
a
good
thing
a
cigar
is
that
s
one
thing
a
man
will
never
tire
of
he
said
to
himself
of
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
over
whom
at
that
time
all
the
elegant
youth
of
paris
was
mad
he
hardly
thought
the
idea
of
death
expressed
in
the
midst
of
their
pleasure
and
the
fear
of
which
had
more
than
once
darkened
the
brow
of
that
beautiful
creature
who
held
to
the
houris
of
asia
by
her
mother
to
europe
by
her
education
to
the
tropics
by
her
birth
seemed
to
him
merely
one
of
those
deceptions
by
which
women
seek
to
make
themselves
interesting
she
is
from
havana
the
most
spanish
region
to
be
found
in
the
new
world
so
she
preferred
to
feign
terror
rather
than
cast
in
my
teeth
indisposition
or
difficulty
coquetry
or
duty
like
a
parisian
woman
by
her
golden
eyes
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
he
saw
a
hackney
coach
standing
at
the
corner
of
frascati
s
waiting
for
some
gambler
he
awoke
the
driver
was
driven
home
went
to
bed
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
dissipated
which
for
some
queer
reason
of
which
no
rhymer
has
yet
taken
advantage
is
as
profound
as
that
of
innocence
perhaps
it
is
an
instance
of
the
proverbial
axiom
about
noon
de
marsay
awoke
and
stretched
himself
he
felt
the
grip
of
that
sort
of
voracious
hunger
which
old
soldiers
can
remember
having
experienced
on
the
morrow
of
victory
he
was
delighted
therefore
to
see
paul
de
manerville
standing
in
front
of
him
for
at
such
a
time
nothing
is
more
agreeable
than
to
eat
in
company
well
his
friend
remarked
we
all
imagined
that
you
had
been
shut
up
for
the
last
ten
days
with
the
girl
of
the
golden
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
i
have
forgotten
her
faith
i
have
other
fish
to
fry
ah
you
are
playing
at
why
not
asked
de
marsay
with
a
laugh
my
dear
fellow
discretion
is
the
best
form
of
calculation
listen
however
no
i
will
not
say
a
word
you
never
teach
me
anything
i
am
not
disposed
to
make
you
a
gratuitous
present
of
the
treasures
of
my
policy
life
is
a
river
which
is
of
use
for
the
promotion
of
commerce
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
most
sacred
in
life
of
cigars
i
am
no
professor
of
social
economy
for
the
instruction
of
fools
let
us
breakfast
it
costs
less
to
give
you
a
tunny
omelette
than
to
lavish
the
resources
of
my
brain
on
do
you
bargain
with
your
friends
my
dear
fellow
said
henri
who
rarely
denied
himself
a
sarcasm
since
all
the
same
you
may
some
day
need
like
anybody
else
to
use
discretion
and
since
i
have
much
love
for
you
yes
i
like
you
upon
my
word
if
you
only
wanted
a
note
to
keep
you
from
blowing
your
brains
out
you
would
find
it
here
for
we
haven
t
yet
done
any
business
of
that
sort
eh
paul
if
you
had
to
fight
i
would
measure
the
ground
and
load
the
pistols
so
that
you
might
be
killed
according
to
rule
in
short
if
anybody
besides
myself
took
it
into
his
head
to
say
ill
of
you
in
your
absence
he
would
have
to
deal
with
the
somewhat
nasty
gentleman
who
walks
in
my
shoes
there
s
what
i
call
a
friendship
beyond
question
well
my
good
fellow
if
you
should
ever
have
need
of
discretion
understand
that
there
are
two
sorts
of
discretion
the
active
and
the
negative
negative
discretion
is
that
of
fools
who
make
use
of
silence
negation
an
air
of
refusal
the
discretion
of
locked
doors
mere
impotence
active
discretion
proceeds
by
affirmation
suppose
at
the
club
this
evening
i
were
to
say
upon
my
word
of
honor
the
was
not
worth
all
she
cost
me
everybody
would
exclaim
when
i
was
gone
did
you
hear
that
fop
de
marsay
who
tried
to
make
us
believe
that
he
has
already
had
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
it
s
his
way
of
trying
to
disembarrass
himself
of
his
rivals
he
s
no
but
such
a
ruse
is
vulgar
and
dangerous
however
gross
a
folly
one
utters
there
are
always
idiots
to
be
found
who
will
believe
it
the
best
form
of
discretion
is
that
of
women
when
they
want
to
take
the
change
out
of
their
husbands
it
consists
in
compromising
a
woman
with
whom
we
are
not
concerned
or
whom
we
do
not
love
in
order
to
save
the
honor
of
the
one
whom
we
love
well
enough
to
respect
it
is
what
is
called
the
ah
here
is
laurent
what
have
you
got
for
us
some
ostend
oysters
monsieur
le
you
will
know
some
day
paul
how
amusing
it
is
to
make
a
fool
of
the
world
by
depriving
it
of
the
secret
of
one
s
affections
i
derive
an
immense
pleasure
in
escaping
from
the
stupid
jurisdiction
of
the
crowd
which
knows
neither
what
it
wants
nor
what
one
wants
of
it
which
takes
the
means
for
the
end
and
by
turns
curses
and
adores
elevates
and
destroys
what
a
delight
to
impose
emotions
on
it
and
receive
none
from
it
to
tame
it
never
to
obey
it
if
one
may
ever
be
proud
of
anything
is
it
not
a
power
of
which
one
is
at
once
the
cause
and
effect
the
principle
and
the
result
well
no
man
knows
what
i
love
nor
what
i
wish
perhaps
what
i
have
loved
or
what
i
may
have
wished
will
be
known
as
a
drama
which
is
accomplished
is
known
but
to
let
my
game
be
seen
weakness
mistake
i
know
nothing
more
despicable
than
strength
outwitted
by
cunning
can
i
initiate
myself
with
a
laugh
into
the
ambassador
s
part
if
indeed
diplomacy
is
as
difficult
as
life
i
doubt
it
have
you
any
ambition
would
you
like
to
become
something
but
henri
you
are
laughing
at
me
as
though
i
were
not
sufficiently
mediocre
to
arrive
at
good
paul
if
you
go
on
laughing
at
yourself
you
will
soon
be
able
to
laugh
at
everybody
at
breakfast
by
the
time
he
had
started
his
cigars
de
marsay
began
to
see
the
events
of
the
night
in
a
singular
light
like
many
men
of
great
intelligence
his
perspicuity
was
not
spontaneous
as
it
did
not
at
once
penetrate
to
the
heart
of
things
as
with
all
natures
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
living
greatly
in
the
present
of
extracting
so
to
speak
the
essence
of
it
and
assimilating
it
his
had
need
of
a
sort
of
slumber
before
it
could
identify
itself
with
causes
cardinal
de
richelieu
was
so
constituted
and
it
did
not
debar
in
him
the
gift
of
foresight
necessary
to
the
conception
of
great
designs
de
marsay
s
conditions
were
alike
but
at
first
he
only
used
his
weapons
for
the
benefit
of
his
pleasures
and
only
became
one
of
the
most
profound
politicians
of
his
day
when
he
had
saturated
himself
with
those
pleasures
to
which
a
young
man
s
thoughts
when
he
has
money
and
power
are
primarily
directed
man
hardens
himself
thus
he
uses
woman
in
order
that
she
may
not
make
use
of
him
at
this
moment
then
de
marsay
perceived
that
he
had
been
fooled
by
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
seeing
as
he
did
in
perspective
all
that
night
of
which
the
delights
had
been
poured
upon
him
by
degrees
until
they
had
ended
by
flooding
him
in
torrents
he
could
read
at
last
that
page
in
effect
so
brilliant
divine
its
hidden
meaning
the
purely
physical
innocence
of
paquita
the
bewilderment
of
her
joy
certain
words
obscure
at
first
but
now
clear
which
had
escaped
her
in
the
midst
of
that
joy
all
proved
to
him
that
he
had
posed
for
another
person
as
no
social
corruption
was
unknown
to
him
as
he
professed
a
complete
indifference
towards
all
perversities
and
believed
them
to
be
justified
on
the
simple
ground
that
they
were
capable
of
satisfaction
he
was
not
startled
at
vice
he
knew
it
as
one
knows
a
friend
but
he
was
wounded
at
having
served
as
sustenance
for
it
if
his
presumption
was
right
he
had
been
outraged
in
the
most
sensitive
part
of
him
the
mere
suspicion
filled
him
with
fury
he
broke
out
with
the
roar
of
a
tiger
who
has
been
the
sport
of
a
deer
the
cry
of
a
tiger
which
united
a
brute
s
strength
with
the
intelligence
of
the
demon
i
say
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
paul
nothing
i
should
be
sorry
if
you
were
to
be
asked
whether
you
had
anything
against
me
and
were
to
reply
with
a
like
that
it
would
be
a
sure
case
of
fighting
the
next
i
fight
no
more
duels
said
de
marsay
that
seems
to
me
even
more
tragical
do
you
assassinate
then
you
travesty
words
i
my
dear
friend
said
paul
your
jokes
are
of
a
very
sombre
color
this
what
would
you
have
pleasure
ends
in
cruelty
why
i
don
t
know
and
am
not
sufficiently
curious
to
try
and
find
out
these
cigars
are
excellent
give
your
friend
some
tea
do
you
know
paul
i
live
a
brute
s
life
it
should
be
time
to
choose
oneself
a
destiny
to
employ
one
s
powers
on
something
which
makes
life
worth
living
life
is
a
singular
comedy
i
am
frightened
i
laugh
at
the
inconsequence
of
our
social
order
the
government
cuts
off
the
heads
of
poor
devils
who
may
have
killed
a
man
and
licenses
creatures
who
despatch
medically
speaking
a
dozen
young
folks
in
a
season
morality
is
powerless
against
a
dozen
vices
which
destroy
society
and
which
nothing
can

word
of

they
talk
to
us
about
the
immorality
of
the
and
any
other
book
you
like
with
a
vulgar
reputation
but
there
exists
a
book
horrible
filthy
fearful
corrupting
which
is
always
open
and
will
never
be
shut
the
great
book
of
the
world
not
to
mention
another
book
a
thousand
times
more
dangerous
which
is
composed
of
all
that
men
whisper
into
each
other
s
ears
or
women
murmur
behind
their
fans
of
an
evening
in
henri
there
is
certainly
something
extraordinary
the
matter
with
you
that
is
obvious
in
spite
of
your
active
yes
come
i
must
kill

time
until
this
evening

tables

luck

rose
took
a
handful
of
banknotes
and
folded
them
into
his
dressed
himself
and
took
advantage
of
paul
s
carriage
to
repair
to
the
salon
des
etrangers
where
until
dinner
he
consumed
the
time
in
those
exciting
alternations
of
loss
and
gain
which
are
the
last
resource
of
powerful
organizations
when
they
are
compelled
to
exercise
themselves
in
the
void
in
the
evening
he
repaired
to
the
and
submitted
complacently
to
having
his
eyes
bandaged
then
with
that
firm
will
which
only
really
strong
men
have
the
faculty
of
concentrating
he
devoted
his
attention
and
applied
his
intelligence
to
the
task
of
divining
through
what
streets
the
carriage
passed
he
had
a
sort
of
certitude
of
being
taken
to
the
rue
and
being
brought
to
a
halt
at
the
little
gate
in
the
garden
of
the
hotel
when
he
passed
as
on
the
first
occasion
through
this
gate
and
was
put
in
a
litter
carried
doubtless
by
the
mulatto
and
the
coachman
he
understood
as
he
heard
the
gravel
grate
beneath
their
feet
why
they
took
such
minute
precautions
he
would
have
been
able
had
he
been
free
or
if
he
had
walked
to
pluck
a
twig
of
laurel
to
observe
the
nature
of
the
soil
which
clung
to
his
boots
whereas
transported
so
to
speak
ethereally
into
an
inaccessible
mansion
his
good
fortune
must
remain
what
it
had
been
hitherto
a
dream
but
it
is
man
s
despair
that
all
his
work
whether
for
good
or
evil
is
imperfect
all
his
labors
physical
or
intellectual
are
sealed
with
the
mark
of
destruction
there
had
been
a
gentle
rain
the
earth
was
moist
at
certain
vegetable
perfumes
are
far
stronger
than
during
the
day
henri
could
smell
therefore
the
scent
of
the
mignonette
which
lined
the
avenue
along
which
he
was
conveyed
this
indication
was
enough
to
light
him
in
the
researches
which
he
promised
himself
to
make
in
order
to
recognize
the
hotel
which
contained
paquita
s
boudoir
he
studied
in
the
same
way
the
turnings
which
his
bearers
took
within
the
house
and
believed
himself
able
to
recall
them
as
on
the
previous
night
he
found
himself
on
the
ottoman
before
paquita
who
was
undoing
his
bandage
but
he
saw
her
pale
and
altered
she
had
wept
on
her
knees
like
an
angel
in
prayer
but
like
an
angel
profoundly
sad
and
melancholy
the
poor
girl
no
longer
resembled
the
curious
impatient
and
impetuous
creature
who
had
carried
de
marsay
on
her
wings
to
transport
him
to
the
seventh
heaven
of
love
there
was
something
so
true
in
this
despair
veiled
by
pleasure
that
the
terrible
de
marsay
felt
within
him
an
admiration
for
this
new
masterpiece
of
nature
and
forgot
for
the
moment
the
chief
interest
of
his
assignation
what
is
the
matter
with
thee
my
paquita
my
friend
she
said
carry
me
away
this
very
night
bear
me
to
some
place
where
no
one
can
answer
there
is
a
girl
with
a
golden
gaze
here
who
has
long
yonder
i
will
give
thee
as
many
pleasures
as
thou
wouldst
have
of
me
then
when
you
love
me
no
longer
you
shall
leave
me
i
shall
not
complain
i
shall
say
nothing
and
your
desertion
need
cause
you
no
remorse
for
one
day
passed
with
you
only
one
day
in
which
i
have
had
you
before
my
eyes
will
be
worth
all
my
life
to
me
but
if
i
stay
here
i
am
i
can
not
leave
paris
little
one
replied
henri
i
do
not
belong
to
myself
i
am
bound
by
a
vow
to
the
fortune
of
several
persons
who
stand
to
me
as
i
do
to
them
but
i
can
place
you
in
a
refuge
in
paris
where
no
human
power
can
reach
no
she
said
you
forget
the
power
of
never
did
phrase
uttered
by
human
voice
express
terror
more
absolutely
what
could
reach
you
then
if
i
put
myself
between
you
and
the
world
poison
she
said
dona
concha
suspects
you
already
and
she
resumed
letting
the
tears
fall
and
glisten
on
her
cheeks
it
is
easy
enough
to
see
i
am
no
longer
the
same
well
if
you
abandon
me
to
the
fury
of
the
monster
who
will
destroy
me
your
holy
will
be
done
but
come
let
there
be
all
the
pleasures
of
life
in
our
love
besides
i
will
implore
i
will
weep
and
cry
out
and
defend
myself
perhaps
i
shall
be
whom
will
your
implore
he
asked
silence
said
paquita
if
i
obtain
mercy
it
will
perhaps
be
on
account
of
my
give
me
my
robe
said
henri
insidiously
no
no
she
answered
quickly
be
what
you
are
one
of
those
angels
whom
i
have
been
taught
to
hate
and
in
whom
i
only
saw
ogres
whilst
you
are
what
is
fairest
under
the
skies
she
said
caressing
henri
s
hair
you
do
not
know
how
silly
i
am
i
have
learned
nothing
since
i
was
twelve
years
old
i
have
been
shut
up
without
ever
seeing
any
one
i
can
neither
read
nor
write
i
can
only
speak
english
and
how
is
it
then
that
you
receive
letters
from
london
my
letters
see
here
they
are
she
said
proceeding
to
take
some
papers
out
of
a
tall
japanese
vase
she
offered
de
marsay
some
letters
in
which
the
young
man
saw
with
surprise
strange
figures
similar
to
those
of
a
rebus
traced
in
blood
and
illustrating
phrases
full
of
passion
but
he
cried
marveling
at
these
hieroglyphics
created
by
the
alertness
of
jealousy
you
are
in
the
power
of
an
infernal
genius
infernal
she
repeated
but
how
then
were
you
able
to
get
out
ah
she
said
that
was
my
ruin
i
drove
dona
concha
to
choose
between
the
fear
of
immediate
death
and
anger
to
be
i
had
the
curiosity
of
a
demon
i
wished
to
break
the
bronze
circle
which
they
had
described
between
creation
and
me
i
wished
to
see
what
young
people
were
like
for
i
knew
nothing
of
man
except
the
marquis
and
cristemio
our
coachman
and
the
lackey
who
accompanies
us
are
old
men
but
you
were
not
always
thus
shut
up
your
health
ah
she
answered
we
used
to
walk
but
it
was
at
night
and
in
the
country
by
the
side
of
the
seine
away
from
are
you
not
proud
of
being
loved
like
that
no
she
said
no
longer
however
full
it
be
this
hidden
life
is
but
darkness
in
comparison
with
the
what
do
you
call
the
light
thee
my
lovely
adolphe
thee
for
whom
i
would
give
my
life
all
the
passionate
things
that
have
been
told
me
and
that
i
have
inspired
i
feel
for
thee
for
a
certain
time
i
understood
nothing
of
existence
but
now
i
know
what
love
is
and
hitherto
i
have
been
the
loved
one
only
for
myself
i
did
not
love
i
would
give
up
everything
for
you
take
me
away
if
you
like
take
me
as
a
toy
but
let
me
be
near
you
until
you
break
you
will
have
no
regrets
not
one
she
said
letting
him
read
her
eyes
whose
golden
tint
was
pure
and
clear
am
i
the
favored
one
said
henri
to
himself
if
he
suspected
the
truth
he
was
ready
at
that
time
to
pardon
the
offence
in
view
of
a
love
so
single
minded
i
shall
soon
see
he
thought
if
paquita
owed
him
no
account
of
the
past
yet
the
least
recollection
of
it
became
in
his
eyes
a
crime
he
had
therefore
the
sombre
strength
to
withhold
a
portion
of
his
thought
to
study
her
even
while
abandoning
himself
to
the
most
enticing
pleasures
that
ever
peri
descended
from
the
skies
had
devised
for
her
beloved
paquita
seemed
to
have
been
created
for
love
by
a
particular
effort
of
nature
in
a
night
her
feminine
genius
had
made
the
most
rapid
progress
whatever
might
be
the
power
of
this
young
man
and
his
indifference
in
the
matter
of
pleasures
in
spite
of
his
satiety
of
the
previous
night
he
found
in
the
girl
with
the
golden
eyes
that
seraglio
which
a
loving
woman
knows
how
to
create
and
which
a
man
never
refuses
paquita
responded
to
that
passion
which
is
felt
by
all
really
great
men
for
the
infinite
that
mysterious
passion
so
dramatically
expressed
in
faust
so
poetically
translated
in
manfred
and
which
urged
don
juan
to
search
the
heart
of
women
in
his
hope
to
find
there
that
limitless
thought
in
pursuit
of
which
so
many
hunters
after
spectres
have
started
which
wise
men
think
to
discover
in
science
and
which
mystics
find
in
god
alone
the
hope
of
possessing
at
last
the
ideal
being
with
whom
the
struggle
could
be
constant
and
tireless
ravished
de
marsay
who
for
the
first
time
for
long
opened
his
heart
his
nerves
expanded
his
coldness
was
dissipated
in
the
atmosphere
of
that
ardent
soul
his
hard
and
fast
theories
melted
away
and
happiness
colored
his
existence
to
the
tint
of
the
rose
and
white
boudoir
experiencing
the
sting
of
a
higher
pleasure
he
was
carried
beyond
the
limits
within
which
he
had
hitherto
confined
passion
he
would
not
be
surpassed
by
this
girl
whom
a
somewhat
artificial
love
had
formed
all
ready
for
the
needs
of
his
soul
and
then
he
found
in
that
vanity
which
urges
a
man
to
be
in
all
things
a
victor
strength
enough
to
tame
the
girl
but
at
the
same
time
urged
beyond
that
line
where
the
soul
is
mistress
over
herself
he
lost
himself
in
these
delicious
limboes
which
the
vulgar
call
so
foolishly
the
imaginary
he
was
tender
kind
and
confidential
he
affected
paquita
almost
to
madness
why
should
we
not
go
to
sorrento
to
nice
to
chiavari
and
pass
all
our
life
so
will
you
he
asked
of
paquita
in
a
penetrating
voice
was
there
need
to
say
to
me
will
you
she
cried
have
i
a
will
i
am
nothing
apart
from
you
except
in
so
far
as
i
am
a
pleasure
for
you
if
you
would
choose
a
retreat
worthy
of
us
asia
is
the
only
country
where
love
can
unfold
his
wings
you
are
right
answered
henri
let
us
go
to
the
indies
there
where
spring
is
eternal
where
the
earth
grows
only
flowers
where
man
can
display
the
magnificence
of
kings
and
none
shall
say
him
nay
as
in
the
foolish
lands
where
they
would
realize
the
dull
chimera
of
equality
let
us
go
to
the
country
where
one
lives
in
the
midst
of
a
nation
of
slaves
where
the
sun
shines
ever
on
a
palace
which
is
always
white
where
the
air
sheds
perfumes
the
birds
sing
of
love
and
where
when
one
can
love
no
more
one
dies
and
where
one
dies
together
said
paquita
but
do
not
let
us
start
let
us
start
this
moment
take
faith
pleasure
is
the
fairest
climax
of
life
let
us
go
to
asia
but
to
start
my
child
one
needs
much
gold
and
to
have
gold
one
must
set
one
s
affairs
in
she
understood
no
part
of
these
ideas
gold
there
is
a
pile
of
it
here
as
high
as
that
she
said
holding
up
her
hand
it
is
not
what
does
that
matter
she
went
on
if
we
have
need
of
it
let
us
take
it
does
not
belong
to
belong
she
repeated
have
you
not
taken
me
when
we
have
taken
it
it
will
belong
to
he
gave
a
laugh
poor
innocent
you
know
nothing
of
the
nay
but
this
is
what
i
know
she
cried
clasping
henri
to
her
at
the
very
moment
when
de
marsay
was
forgetting
all
and
conceiving
the
desire
to
appropriate
this
creature
forever
he
received
in
the
midst
of
his
joy
a
which
paquita
who
had
lifted
him
vigorously
in
the
air
as
though
to
contemplate
him
exclaimed
oh
margarita
margarita
cried
the
young
man
with
a
roar
now
i
know
all
that
i
still
tried
to
he
leaped
upon
the
cabinet
in
which
the
long
poniard
was
kept
happily
for
paquita
and
for
himself
the
cupboard
was
shut
his
fury
waxed
at
this
impediment
but
he
recovered
his
tranquillity
went
and
found
his
cravat
and
advanced
towards
her
with
an
air
of
such
ferocious
meaning
that
without
knowing
of
what
crime
she
had
been
guilty
paquita
understood
none
the
less
that
her
life
was
in
question
with
one
bound
she
rushed
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
to
escape
the
fatal
knot
which
de
marsay
tried
to
pass
round
her
neck
there
was
a
struggle
on
either
side
there
was
an
equality
of
strength
agility
and
suppleness
to
end
the
combat
paquita
threw
between
the
legs
of
her
lover
a
cushion
which
made
him
fall
and
profited
by
the
respite
which
this
advantage
gave
to
her
to
push
the
button
of
the
spring
which
caused
the
bell
to
ring
promptly
the
mulatto
arrived
in
a
second
cristemio
leaped
on
de
marsay
and
held
him
down
with
one
foot
on
his
chest
his
heel
turned
towards
the
throat
de
marsay
realized
that
if
he
struggled
at
a
single
sign
from
paquita
he
would
be
instantly
crushed
why
did
you
want
to
kill
me
my
beloved
she
said
de
marsay
made
no
reply
in
what
have
i
angered
you
she
asked
speak
let
us
understand
each
henri
maintained
the
phlegmatic
attitude
of
a
strong
man
who
feels
himself
vanquished
his
countenance
cold
silent
entirely
english
revealed
the
consciousness
of
his
dignity
in
a
momentary
resignation
moreover
he
had
already
thought
in
spite
of
the
vehemence
of
his
anger
that
it
was
scarcely
prudent
to
compromise
himself
with
the
law
by
killing
this
girl
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
before
he
had
arranged
the
murder
in
such
a
manner
as
should
insure
his
impunity
my
beloved
went
on
paquita
speak
to
me
do
not
leave
me
without
one
loving
farewell
i
would
not
keep
in
my
heart
the
terror
which
you
have
just
inspired
in
it
will
you
speak
she
said
stamping
her
foot
with
anger
de
marsay
for
all
reply
gave
her
a
glance
which
signified
so
plainly
must
die
that
paquita
threw
herself
upon
him
ah
well
you
want
to
kill
me
if
my
death
can
give
you
any
pleasure
kill
me
she
made
a
sign
to
cristemio
who
withdrew
his
foot
from
the
body
of
the
young
man
and
retired
without
letting
his
face
show
that
he
had
formed
any
opinion
good
or
bad
with
regard
to
paquita
that
is
a
man
said
de
marsay
pointing
to
the
mulatto
with
a
sombre
gesture
there
is
no
devotion
like
the
devotion
which
obeys
in
friendship
and
does
not
stop
to
weigh
motives
in
that
man
you
possess
a
true
i
will
give
him
you
if
you
like
she
answered
he
will
serve
you
with
the
same
devotion
that
he
has
for
me
if
i
so
instruct
she
waited
for
a
word
of
recognition
and
went
on
with
an
accent
replete
with
tenderness
adolphe
give
me
then
one
kind
word
it
is
nearly
henri
did
not
answer
the
young
man
had
one
sorry
quality
for
one
considers
as
something
great
everything
which
resembles
strength
and
often
men
invent
extravagances
henri
knew
not
how
to
pardon
that
upon
which
is
one
of
the
soul
s
graces
was
a
sense
for
him
the
ferocity
of
the
northern
man
with
which
the
english
blood
is
deeply
tainted
had
been
transmitted
to
him
by
his
father
he
was
inexorable
both
in
his
good
and
evil
impulses
paquita
s
exclamation
had
been
all
the
more
horrible
to
him
in
that
it
had
dethroned
him
from
the
sweetest
triumph
which
had
ever
flattered
his
man
s
vanity
hope
love
and
every
emotion
had
been
exalted
with
him
all
had
lit
up
within
his
heart
and
his
intelligence
then
these
torches
illuminating
his
life
had
been
extinguished
by
a
cold
wind
paquita
in
her
stupefaction
of
grief
had
only
strength
enough
to
give
the
signal
for
departure
what
is
the
use
of
that
she
said
throwing
away
the
bandage
if
he
does
not
love
me
if
he
hates
me
it
is
all
she
waited
for
one
look
did
not
obtain
it
and
fell
half
dead
the
mulatto
cast
a
glance
at
henri
so
horribly
significant
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
young
man
to
whom
no
one
denied
the
gift
of
rare
courage
trembled
you
do
not
love
her
well
if
you
give
her
the
least
pain
i
will
kill
such
was
the
sense
of
that
brief
gaze
de
marsay
was
escorted
with
a
care
almost
obsequious
along
the
dimly
lit
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
he
issued
by
a
secret
door
into
the
garden
of
the
hotel
the
mulatto
made
him
walk
cautiously
through
an
avenue
of
lime
trees
which
led
to
a
little
gate
opening
upon
a
street
which
was
at
that
hour
deserted
de
marsay
took
a
keen
notice
of
everything
the
carriage
awaited
him
this
time
the
mulatto
did
not
accompany
him
and
at
the
moment
when
henri
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
to
look
once
more
at
the
gardens
of
the
hotel
he
encountered
the
white
eyes
of
cristemio
with
whom
he
exchanged
a
glance
on
either
side
there
was
a
provocation
a
challenge
the
declaration
of
a
savage
war
of
a
duel
in
which
ordinary
laws
were
invalid
where
treason
and
treachery
were
admitted
means
cristemio
knew
that
henri
had
sworn
paquita
s
death
henri
knew
that
cristemio
would
like
to
kill
him
before
he
killed
paquita
both
understood
each
other
to
perfection
the
adventure
is
growing
complicated
in
a
most
interesting
way
said
henri
where
is
the
gentleman
going
to
asked
the
coachman
de
marsay
was
driven
to
the
house
of
paul
de
manerville
for
more
than
a
week
henri
was
away
from
home
and
no
one
could
discover
either
what
he
did
during
this
period
nor
where
he
stayed
this
retreat
saved
him
from
the
fury
of
the
mulatto
and
caused
the
ruin
of
the
charming
creature
who
had
placed
all
her
hope
in
him
whom
she
loved
as
never
human
heart
had
loved
on
this
earth
before
on
the
last
day
of
the
week
about
eleven
o
clock
at
night
henri
drove
up
in
a
carriage
to
the
little
gate
in
the
garden
of
the
hotel
four
men
accompanied
him
the
driver
was
evidently
one
of
his
friends
for
he
stood
up
on
his
box
like
a
man
who
was
to
listen
an
attentive
sentinel
for
the
least
sound
one
of
the
other
three
took
his
stand
outside
the
gate
in
the
street
the
second
waited
in
the
garden
leaning
against
the
wall
the
last
who
carried
in
his
hand
a
bunch
of
keys
accompanied
de
marsay
henri
said
his
companion
to
him
we
are
by
whom
my
good
ferragus
they
are
not
all
asleep
replied
the
chief
of
the
devourers
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
some
one
in
the
house
has
neither
eaten
nor
drunk
look
see
that
light
we
have
a
plan
of
the
house
from
where
does
it
come
i
need
no
plan
to
know
replied
ferragus
it
comes
from
the
room
of
the
ah
cried
de
marsay
no
doubt
she
arrived
from
london
the
woman
has
robbed
me
even
of
my
revenge
but
if
she
has
anticipated
me
my
good
gratien
we
will
give
her
up
to
the
listen
listen
the
thing
is
settled
said
ferragus
to
henri
the
two
friends
listened
intently
and
heard
some
feeble
cries
which
might
have
aroused
pity
in
the
breast
of
a
tiger
your
marquise
did
not
think
the
sound
would
escape
by
the
chimney
said
the
chief
of
the
devourers
with
the
laugh
of
a
critic
enchanted
to
detect
a
fault
in
a
work
of
merit
we
alone
we
know
how
to
provide
for
every
contingency
said
henri
wait
for
me
i
want
to
see
what
is
going
on
upstairs
i
want
to
know
how
their
domestic
quarrels
are
managed
by
god
i
believe
she
is
roasting
her
at
a
slow
de
marsay
lightly
scaled
the
stairs
with
which
he
was
familiar
and
recognized
the
passage
leading
to
the
boudoir
when
he
opened
the
door
he
experienced
the
involuntary
shudder
which
the
sight
of
bloodshed
gives
to
the
most
determined
of
men
the
spectacle
which
was
offered
to
his
view
was
moreover
in
more
than
one
respect
astonishing
to
him
the
marquise
was
a
woman
she
had
calculated
her
vengeance
with
that
perfection
of
perfidy
which
distinguishes
the
weaker
animals
she
had
dissimulated
her
anger
in
order
to
assure
herself
of
the
crime
before
she
punished
it
too
late
my
beloved
said
paquita
in
her
death
agony
casting
her
pale
eyes
upon
de
marsay
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
expired
in
a
bath
of
blood
the
great
illumination
of
candles
a
delicate
perfume
which
was
perceptible
a
certain
disorder
in
which
the
eye
of
a
man
accustomed
to
amorous
adventures
could
not
but
discern
the
madness
which
is
common
to
all
the
passions
revealed
how
cunningly
the
marquise
had
interrogated
the
guilty
one
the
white
room
where
the
blood
showed
so
well
betrayed
a
long
struggle
the
prints
of
paquita
s
hands
were
on
the
cushions
here
she
had
clung
to
her
life
here
she
had
defended
herself
here
she
had
been
struck
long
strips
of
the
tapestry
had
been
torn
down
by
her
bleeding
hands
which
without
a
doubt
had
struggled
long
paquita
must
have
tried
to
reach
the
window
her
bare
feet
had
left
their
imprints
on
the
edge
of
the
divan
along
which
she
must
have
run
her
body
mutilated
by
the
of
her
executioner
told
of
the
fury
with
which
she
had
disputed
a
life
which
henri
had
made
precious
to
her
she
lay
stretched
on
the
floor
and
in
her
had
bitten
the
ankles
of
madame
de
who
still
held
in
her
hand
her
dagger
dripping
blood
the
hair
of
the
marquise
had
been
torn
out
she
was
covered
with
bites
many
of
which
were
bleeding
and
her
torn
dress
revealed
her
in
a
state
of
with
the
scratches
on
her
breasts
she
was
sublime
so
her
head
eager
and
maddened
exhaled
the
odor
of
blood
her
panting
mouth
was
open
and
her
nostrils
were
not
sufficient
for
her
breath
there
are
certain
animals
who
fall
upon
their
enemy
in
their
rage
do
it
to
death
and
seem
in
the
tranquillity
of
victory
to
have
forgotten
it
there
are
others
who
prowl
around
their
victim
who
guard
it
in
fear
lest
it
should
be
taken
away
from
them
and
who
like
the
achilles
of
homer
drag
their
enemy
by
the
feet
nine
times
round
the
walls
of
troy
the
marquise
was
like
that
she
did
not
see
henri
in
the
first
place
she
was
too
secure
of
her
solitude
to
be
afraid
of
witnesses
and
secondly
she
was
too
intoxicated
with
warm
blood
too
excited
with
the
fray
too
exalted
to
take
notice
of
the
whole
of
paris
if
paris
had
formed
a
circle
round
her
a
thunderbolt
would
not
have
disturbed
her
she
had
not
even
heard
paquita
s
last
sigh
and
believed
that
the
dead
girl
could
still
hear
her
die
without
confessing
she
said
go
down
to
hell
monster
of
ingratitude
belong
to
no
one
but
the
fiend
for
the
blood
you
gave
him
you
owe
me
all
your
own
die
die
suffer
a
thousand
deaths
i
have
been
too
kind
i
was
only
a
moment
killing
you
i
should
have
made
you
experience
all
the
tortures
that
you
have
bequeathed
to
me
i
i
shall
live
i
shall
live
in
misery
i
have
no
one
left
to
love
but
god
she
gazed
at
her
she
is
dead
she
said
to
herself
after
a
pause
in
a
violent
reaction
dead
oh
i
shall
die
of
grief
the
marquise
was
throwing
herself
upon
the
divan
stricken
with
a
despair
which
deprived
her
of
speech
when
this
movement
brought
her
in
view
of
henri
de
marsay
who
are
you
she
asked
rushing
at
him
with
her
dagger
raised
henri
caught
her
arm
and
thus
they
could
contemplate
each
other
face
to
face
a
horrible
surprise
froze
the
blood
in
their
veins
and
their
limbs
quivered
like
those
of
frightened
horses
in
effect
the
two
menoechmi
had
not
been
more
alike
with
one
accord
they
uttered
the
same
phrase
lord
dudley
must
have
been
your
father
the
head
of
each
was
drooped
in
affirmation
she
was
true
to
the
blood
said
henri
pointing
to
paquita
she
was
as
little
guilty
as
it
is
possible
to
be
replied
margarita
euphemia
porraberil
and
she
threw
herself
upon
the
body
of
paquita
giving
vent
to
a
cry
of
despair
poor
child
oh
if
i
could
bring
thee
to
life
again
i
was
wrong
forgive
me
paquita
dead
and
i
live
i
i
am
the
most
at
that
moment
the
horrible
face
of
the
mother
of
paquita
appeared
you
are
come
to
tell
me
that
you
never
sold
her
to
me
to
kill
cried
the
marquise
i
know
why
you
have
left
your
lair
i
will
pay
you
twice
over
hold
your
she
took
a
bag
of
gold
from
the
ebony
cabinet
and
threw
it
contemptuously
at
the
old
woman
s
feet
the
chink
of
the
gold
was
potent
enough
to
excite
a
smile
on
the
georgian
s
impassive
face
i
come
at
the
right
moment
for
you
my
sister
said
henri
the
law
will
ask
of
you
nothing
replied
the
marquise
one
person
alone
might
ask
for
a
reckoning
for
the
death
of
this
girl
cristemio
is
and
the
mother
said
henri
pointing
to
the
old
woman
will
you
not
always
be
in
her
power
she
comes
from
a
country
where
women
are
not
beings
but
things
chattels
with
which
one
does
as
one
wills
which
one
buys
sells
and
slays
in
short
which
one
uses
for
one
s
caprices
as
you
here
use
a
piece
of
furniture
besides
she
has
one
passion
which
dominates
all
the
others
and
which
would
have
stifled
her
maternal
love
even
if
she
had
loved
her
daughter
a
passion
what
henri
asked
quickly
interrupting
his
sister
play
god
keep
you
from
it
answered
the
marquise
but
whom
have
you
said
henri
looking
at
the
girl
of
the
golden
eyes
who
will
help
you
to
remove
the
traces
of
this
fantasy
which
the
law
would
not
overlook
i
have
her
mother
replied
the
marquise
designating
the
georgian
to
whom
she
made
a
sign
to
remain
we
shall
meet
again
said
henri
who
was
thinking
anxiously
of
his
friends
and
felt
that
it
was
time
to
leave
no
brother
she
said
we
shall
not
meet
again
i
am
going
back
to
spain
to
enter
the
convent
of
you
are
too
young
yet
too
lovely
said
henri
taking
her
in
his
arms
and
giving
her
a
kiss
she
said
there
is
no
consolation
when
you
have
lost
that
which
has
seemed
to
you
