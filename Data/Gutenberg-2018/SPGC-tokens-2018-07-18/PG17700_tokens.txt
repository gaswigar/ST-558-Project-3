preface
this
monograph
was
begun
during
my
residence
as
rogers
memorial
fellow
at
harvard
university
and
is
based
mainly
upon
a
study
of
the
sources
national
state
and
colonial
statutes
congressional
documents
reports
of
societies
personal
narratives
etc
the
collection
of
laws
available
for
this
research
was
i
think
nearly
complete
on
the
other
hand
facts
and
statistics
bearing
on
the
economic
side
of
the
study
have
been
difficult
to
find
and
my
conclusions
are
consequently
liable
to
modification
from
this
source
the
question
of
the
suppression
of
the
is
so
intimately
connected
with
the
questions
as
to
its
rise
the
system
of
american
slavery
and
the
whole
colonial
policy
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
it
is
difficult
to
isolate
it
and
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
superficiality
on
the
one
hand
and
unscientific
narrowness
of
view
on
the
other
while
i
could
not
hope
entirely
to
overcome
such
a
difficulty
i
nevertheless
trust
that
i
have
succeeded
in
rendering
this
monograph
a
small
contribution
to
the
scientific
study
of
slavery
and
the
american
negro
i
desire
to
express
my
obligation
to
albert
bushnell
hart
of
harvard
university
at
whose
suggestion
i
began
this
work
and
by
whose
kind
aid
and
encouragement
i
have
brought
it
to
a
close
also
i
have
to
thank
the
trustees
of
the

made
it

from

times
until

to

the
study
begins
with
the
colonial
period
setting
forth
in

the
attitude
of
england
and
more
in

the
attitude
of
the
planting

with

is
studied

of

rise
of
the
english
any
attempt
to
consider
the
attitude
of
the
english
colonies
toward
the
african
must
be
prefaced
by
a
word
as
to
the
attitude
of
england
herself
and
the
development
of
the
trade
in
her
hands
sir
john
hawkins
celebrated
voyage
took
place
in
but
probably
not
until
did
a
regular
chartered
company
undertake
to
carry
on
the
trade
this
company
was
unsuccessful
and
was
eventually
succeeded
by
the
company
of
royal
adventurers
trading
to
africa
chartered
by
charles
ii
in
and
including
the
queen
dowager
and
the
duke
of
york
the
company
contracted
to
supply
the
west
indies
with
three
thousand
slaves
annually
but
contraband
trade
misconduct
and
war
so
reduced
it
that
in
it
surrendered
its
charter
to
another
company
for
this
new
corporation
chartered
by
charles
ii
as
the
royal
african
company
proved
more
successful
than
its
predecessors
and
carried
on
a
growing
trade
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
parliamentary
interference
with
the
trade
began
by
the
statute
and
william
and
mary
chapter
private
traders
on
payment
of
a
duty
of
on
english
goods
exported
to
africa
were
allowed
to
participate
in
the
trade
this
was
brought
about
by
the
clamor
of
the
merchants
especially
the
american
merchants
who
in
their
petition
suggest
that
it
would
be
a
great
benefit
to
the
kingdom
to
secure
the
trade
by
maintaining
forts
and
castles
there
with
an
equal
duty
upon
all
goods
exported
this
plan
being
a
compromise
between
maintaining
the
monopoly
intact
and
entirely
abolishing
it
was
adopted
and
the
statute
declared
the
trade
highly
beneficial
and
advantageous
to
this
kingdom
and
to
the
plantations
and
colonies
thereunto
belonging
having
thus
gained
practically
free
admittance
to
the
field
english
merchants
sought
to
exclude
other
nations
by
securing
a
monopoly
of
the
lucrative
spanish
colonial
their
object
was
finally
accomplished
by
the
signing
of
the
assiento
in
the
assiento
was
a
treaty
between
england
and
spain
by
which
the
latter
granted
the
former
a
monopoly
of
the
spanish
colonial
for
thirty
years
and
england
engaged
to
supply
the
colonies
within
that
time
with
at
least
slaves
at
the
rate
of
per
year
england
was
also
to
advance
spain
crowns
and
to
pay
a
duty
of
crowns
for
each
slave
imported
the
kings
of
spain
and
england
were
each
to
receive
of
the
profits
of
the
trade
and
the
royal
african
company
were
authorized
to
import
as
many
slaves
as
they
wished
above
the
specified
number
in
the
first
years
and
to
sell
them
except
in
three
ports
at
any
price
they
could
get
it
is
stated
that
in
the
twenty
years
from
to
fifteen
thousand
slaves
were
annually
imported
into
america
by
the
english
of
whom
from
to
went
to
the
spanish
colonies
to
the
company
itself
the
venture
proved
a
financial
failure
for
during
the
years
parliament
assisted
the
royal
company
by
annual
grants
which
amounted
to
and
by
spain
was
a
creditor
to
the
extent
of
and
threatened
to
suspend
the
treaty
the
war
interrupted
the
carrying
out
of
the
contract
but
the
peace
of
extended
the
limit
by
four
years
finally
october
this
privilege
was
waived
for
a
money
consideration
paid
to
england
the
assiento
was
ended
and
the
royal
company
was
bankrupt
by
the
statute
george
chapter
the
old
company
was
dissolved
and
a
new
company
of
merchants
trading
to
africa
erected
in
its
stead
any
merchant
so
desiring
was
allowed
to
engage
in
the
trade
on
payment
of
certain
small
duties
and
such
merchants
formed
a
company
headed
by
nine
directors
this
marked
the
total
abolition
of
monopoly
in
the
and
was
the
form
under
which
the
trade
was
carried
on
until
after
the
american
revolution
that
the
was
the
very
life
of
the
colonies
had
by
become
an
almost
unquestioned
axiom
in
british
practical
economics
the
colonists
themselves
declared
slaves
the
strength
and
sinews
of
this
western
world
and
the
lack
of
them
the
grand
obstruction
here
as
the
settlements
can
not
subsist
without
supplies
of
them
thus
with
merchants
clamoring
at
home
and
planters
abroad
it
easily
became
the
settled
policy
of
england
to
encourage
the
then
too
she
readily
argued
that
what
was
an
economic
necessity
in
jamaica
and
the
barbadoes
could
scarcely
be
disadvantageous
to
carolina
virginia
or
even
new
york
consequently
the
colonial
governors
were
generally
instructed
to
give
all
due
encouragement
and
invitation
to
merchants
and
others
and
in
particular
to
the
royal
african
company
of
england
duties
laid
on
the
importer
and
all
acts
in
any
way
restricting
the
trade
were
frowned
upon
and
very
often
disallowed
whereas
ran
governor
dobbs
instructions
acts
have
been
passed
in
some
of
our
plantations
in
america
for
laying
duties
on
the
importation
and
exportation
of
negroes
to
the
great
discouragement
of
the
merchants
trading
thither
from
the
coast
of
africa
it
is
our
will
and
pleasure
that
you
do
not
give
your
assent
to
or
pass
any
law
imposing
duties
upon
negroes
imported
into
our
province
of
north
carolina
the
exact
proportions
of
the
to
america
can
be
but
approximately
determined
from
to
the
african
company
sent
ships
to
africa
shipped
there
negro
slaves
and
after
losing
on
the
middle
passage
delivered
in
america
the
trade
increased
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
ships
clearing
for
africa
in
it
then
dwindled
until
the
signing
of
the
assiento
standing
at
clearances
in
the
final
dissolution
of
the
monopoly
in
led
excepting
in
the
years
when
the
closing
of
spanish
marts
sensibly
affected
the
trade
to
an
extraordinary
development
clearances
being
made
in
the
revolutionary
war
nearly
stopped
the
traffic
but
by
the
clearances
had
risen
again
to
to
these
figures
must
be
added
the
unregistered
trade
of
americans
and
foreigners
it
is
probable
that
about
slaves
were
brought
to
america
each
year
between
and
the
importation
then
dwindled
but
rose
after
the
assiento
to
perhaps
the
proportion
too
of
these
slaves
carried
to
the
continent
now
began
to
increase
of
about
whom
the
english
annually
imported
from
to
south
carolina
alone
received
some
before
the
revolution
the
total
exportation
to
america
is
variously
estimated
as
between
and
each
year
bancroft
places
the
total
slave
population
of
the
continental
colonies
at
in
in
and
in
the
census
of
showed
slaves
in
the
united
states
in
colonies
like
those
in
the
west
indies
and
in
south
carolina
and
georgia
the
rapid
importation
into
america
of
a
multitude
of
savages
gave
rise
to
a
system
of
slavery
far
different
from
that
which
the
late
civil
war
abolished
the
strikingly
harsh
and
even
inhuman
slave
codes
in
these
colonies
show
this
crucifixion
burning
and
starvation
were
legal
modes
of
punishment
the
rough
and
brutal
character
of
the
time
and
place
was
partly
responsible
for
this
but
a
more
decisive
reason
lay
in
the
fierce
and
turbulent
character
of
the
imported
negroes
the
docility
to
which
long
years
of
bondage
and
strict
discipline
gave
rise
was
absent
and
insurrections
and
acts
of
violence
were
of
frequent
occurrence
again
and
again
the
danger
of
planters
being
cut
off
by
their
own
negroes
is
mentioned
both
in
the
islands
and
on
the
continent
this
condition
of
vague
dread
and
unrest
not
only
increased
the
severity
of
laws
and
strengthened
the
police
system
but
was
the
prime
motive
back
of
all
the
earlier
efforts
to
check
the
further
importation
of
slaves
on
the
other
hand
in
new
england
and
new
york
the
negroes
were
merely
house
servants
or
farm
hands
and
were
treated
neither
better
nor
worse
than
servants
in
general
in
those
days
between
these
two
extremes
the
system
of
slavery
varied
from
a
mild
serfdom
in
pennsylvania
and
new
jersey
to
an
aristocratic
caste
system
in
maryland
and
virginia

the
early
attitude
of
these

toward
the
is
therefore
of
peculiar
interest
for
their
action
was
of
necessity
largely
decisive
for
the
future
of
the
trade
and
for
the
institution
in
north
america
theirs
was
the
only
soil
climate
and
society
suited
to
slavery
in
the
other
colonies
with
few
exceptions
the
institution
was
by
these

factors
doomed
from
the
beginning
hence
only
strong
moral
and
political
motives
could
in
the
planting
colonies
overthrow
or
check
a
traffic
so
favored
by
the
mother
country
in
in
georgia
we
have
an
example
of
a
community
whose
philanthropic
founders
sought
to
impose
upon
it
a
code
of
morals
higher
than
the
colonists
wished
the
settlers
of
georgia
were
of
even
worse
moral
fibre
than
their
and
neighbors
in
carolina
and
virginia
yet
oglethorpe
and
the
london
proprietors
prohibited
from
the
beginning
both
the
rum
and
the
slave
traffic
refusing
to
suffer
slavery
which
is
against
the
gospel
as
well
as
the
fundamental
law
of
england
to
be
authorised
under
our
authority
the
trustees
sought
to
win
the
colonists
over
to
their
belief
by
telling
them
that
money
could
be
better
expended
in
transporting
white
men
than
negroes
that
slaves
would
be
a
source
of
weakness
to
the
colony
and
that
the
produces
designed
to
be
raised
in
the
colony
would
not
require
such
labour
as
to
make
negroes
necessary
for
carrying
them
on
this
policy
greatly
displeased
the
colonists
who
from
the
date
of
the
first
law
to
did
not
cease
to
clamor
for
the
repeal
of
the
restrictions
as
their
english
agent
said
they
insisted
that
in
spight
of
all
endeavours
to
disguise
this
point
it
is
as
clear
as
light
itself
that
negroes
are
as
essentially
necessary
to
the
cultivation
of
as
axes
hoes
or
any
other
utensil
of
agriculture
meantime
evasions
and
infractions
of
the
laws
became
frequent
and
notorious
negroes
were
brought
across
from
carolina
and
hired
for
life
finally
purchases
were
openly
made
in
savannah
from
african
traders
some
seizures
were
made
by
those
who
opposed
the
principle
but
as
a
majority
of
the
magistrates
were
favorable
to
the
introduction
of
slaves
into
the
province
legal
decisions
were
suspended
from
time
to
time
and
a
strong
disposition
evidenced
by
the
courts
to
evade
the
operation
of
the
law
at
last
in
the
colonists
prevailed
on
the
trustees
and
the
government
and
the
trade
was
thrown
open
under
careful
restrictions
which
limited
importation
required
a
registry
and
quarantine
on
all
slaves
brought
in
and
laid
a
duty
it
is
probable
however
that
these
restrictions
were
never
enforced
and
that
the
trade
thus
established
continued
unchecked
until
the
revolution
in
south
south
carolina
had
the
largest
and
most
widely
developed
of
any
of
the
continental
colonies
this
was
owing
to
the
character
of
her
settlers
her
nearness
to
the
west
indian
slave
marts
and
the
early
development
of
certain
staple
crops
such
as
rice
which
were
adapted
to
slave
labor
moreover
this
colony
suffered
much
less
interference
from
the
home
government
than
many
other
colonies
thus
it
is
possible
here
to
trace
the
untrammeled
development
of
restrictions
in
a
typical
planting
community
as
early
as
the
to
south
carolina
had
reached
such
proportions
that
it
was
thought
that
the
great
number
of
negroes
which
of
late
have
been
imported
into
this
collony
may
endanger
the
safety
thereof
the
immigration
of
white
servants
was
therefore
encouraged
by
a
special
law
increase
of
immigration
reduced
this
disproportion
but
negroes
continued
to
be
imported
in
such
numbers
as
to
afford
considerable
revenue
from
a
moderate
duty
on
them
about
the
time
when
the
assiento
was
signed
the
so
increased
that
scarcely
a
year
after
the
consummation
of
that
momentous
agreement
two
heavy
duty
acts
were
passed
because
the
number
of
negroes
do
extremely
increase
in
this
province
and
through
the
afflicting
providence
of
god
the
white
persons
do
not
proportionately
multiply
by
reason
whereof
the
safety
of
the
said
province
is
greatly
endangered
the
trade
however
by
reason
of
the
encouragement
abroad
and
of
increased
business
activity
in
exporting
naval
stores
at
home
suffered
scarcely
any
check
although
repeated
acts
reciting
the
danger
incident
to
a
great
importation
of
negroes
were
passed
laying
high
duties
finally
in
an
additional
duty
of
although
due
in
depreciated
currency
succeeded
so
nearly
in
stopping
the
trade
that
two
years
later
all
existing
duties
were
repealed
and
one
of
substituted
this
continued
during
the
time
of
resistance
to
the
proprietary
government
but
by
the
importation
had
again
reached
large
proportions
we
must
therefore
beg
leave
the
colonists
write
in
that
year
to
inform
your
majesty
that
amidst
our
other
perilous
circumstances
we
are
subject
to
many
intestine
dangers
from
the
great
number
of
negroes
that
are
now
among
us
who
amount
at
least
to
thousand
persons
and
are
three
to
one
of
all
your
white
subjects
in
this
province
insurrections
against
us
have
been
often
attempted
in
an
insurrection
under
a
slave
cato
at
stono
caused
such
widespread
alarm
that
a
prohibitory
duty
of
was
immediately
laid
importation
was
again
checked
but
in
the
colony
sought
to
devise
a
plan
whereby
the
slightly
restricted
immigration
of
negroes
should
provide
a
fund
to
encourage
the
importation
of
white
servants
to
prevent
the
mischiefs
that
may
be
attended
by
the
great
importation
of
negroes
into
this
province
many
white
servants
were
thus
encouraged
to
settle
in
the
colony
but
so
much
larger
was
the
influx
of
black
slaves
that
the
colony
in
totally
prohibited
the
this
act
was
promptly
disallowed
by
the
privy
council
and
the
governor
reprimanded
but
the
colony
declared
that
an
importation
of
negroes
equal
in
number
to
what
have
been
imported
of
late
years
may
prove
of
the
most
dangerous
consequence
in
many
respects
to
this
province
and
the
best
way
to
obviate
such
danger
will
be
by
imposing
such
an
additional
duty
upon
them
as
may
totally
prevent
the
evils
a
prohibitive
duty
of
was
accordingly
imposed
in
this
duty
probably
continued
until
the
revolution
the
war
made
a
great
change
in
the
situation
it
has
been
computed
by
good
judges
that
between
the
years
and
the
state
of
south
carolina
lost
thousand
negroes
by
actual
hostilities
plunder
of
the
british
runaways
etc
after
the
war
the
trade
quickly
revived
and
considerable
revenue
was
raised
from
duty
acts
until
when
by
act
and
ordinance
the
was
totally
prohibited
this
prohibition
by
renewals
from
time
to
time
lasted
until
in
north
in
early
times
there
were
few
slaves
in
north
carolina
this
fact
together
with
the
troubled
and
turbulent
state
of
affairs
during
the
early
colonial
period
did
not
necessitate
the
adoption
of
any
settled
policy
toward
slavery
or
the
later
the
to
the
colony
increased
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
effort
to
restrict
or
in
any
way
regulate
it
before
when
it
was
declared
that
the
importation
of
slaves
into
this
state
is
productive
of
evil
consequences
and
highly
impolitic
and
a
prohibitive
duty
was
laid
on
them
in
next
to
south
carolina
virginia
had
probably
the
largest
her
situation
however
differed
considerably
from
that
of
her
southern
neighbor
the
climate
the
staple
tobacco
crop
and
the
society
of
virginia
were
favorable
to
a
system
of
domestic
slavery
but
one
which
tended
to
develop
into
a
patriarchal
serfdom
rather
than
into
a
industrial
hierarchy
the
labor
required
by
the
tobacco
crop
was
less
unhealthy
than
that
connected
with
the
rice
crop
and
the
virginians
were
perhaps
on
a
somewhat
higher
moral
plane
than
the
carolinians
there
was
consequently
no
such
insatiable
demand
for
slaves
in
the
larger
colony
on
the
other
hand
the
power
of
the
virginia
executive
was
peculiarly
strong
and
it
was
not
possible
here
to
thwart
the
policy
of
the
home
government
as
easily
as
elsewhere
considering
all
these
circumstances
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
determine
just
what
was
the
attitude
of
the
early
virginians
toward
the
there
is
evidence
however
to
show
that
although
they
desired
the
the
rate
at
which
the
negroes
were
brought
in
soon
alarmed
them
in
a
duty
of
was
laid
on
negroes
but
governor
spotswood
soon
perceived
that
the
laying
so
high
a
duty
on
negros
was
intended
to
discourage
the
importation
and
vetoed
the
measure
no
further
restrictive
legislation
was
attempted
for
some
years
but
whether
on
account
of
the
attitude
of
the
governor
or
the
desire
of
the
inhabitants
is
not
clear
with
begins
a
series
of
acts
extending
down
to
the
revolution
which
so
far
as
their
contents
can
be
ascertained
seem
to
have
been
designed
effectually
to
check
the
some
of
these
acts
like
those
of
and
were
almost
immediately
disallowed
the
act
of
laid
a
duty
of
which
was
continued
until
and
all
other
duties
were
in
addition
to
this
so
that
by
such
cumulative
duties
the
rate
on
slaves
reached
in
and
at
the
time
of
expedition
these
acts
were
found
very
burthensome
introductive
of
many
frauds
and
very
inconvenient
and
were
so
far
repealed
that
by
the
duty
was
only
as
now
the
burgesses
became
more
powerful
two
or
more
bills
proposing
restrictive
duties
were
passed
but
disallowed
by
the
feeling
had
become
considerably
developed
and
the
burgesses
petitioned
the
king
declaring
that
the
importation
of
slaves
into
the
colonies
from
the
coast
of
africa
hath
long
been
considered
as
a
trade
of
great
inhumanity
and
under
its
present
encouragement
we
have
too
much
reason
to
fear
endanger
the
very
of
your
majesty
american
dominions
deeply
impressed
with
these
sentiments
we
most
humbly
beseech
your
majesty
to
remove
those
on
your
majesty
governors
of
this
colony
inhibit
their
assenting
to
such
laws
as
might
check
so
very
pernicious
a
nothing
further
appears
to
have
been
done
before
the
war
when
in
the
delegates
adopted
a
frame
of
government
it
was
charged
in
this
document
that
the
king
had
perverted
his
high
office
into
a
detestable
and
insupportable
tyranny
by
prompting
our
negroes
to
rise
in
arms
among
us
those
very
negroes
whom
by
an
inhuman
use
of
his
negative
he
hath
refused
us
permission
to
exclude
by
law
two
years
later
in
an
act
to
prevent
the
further
importation
of
slaves
stopped
definitively
the
legal
to
virginia
in
not
until
the
impulse
of
the
assiento
had
been
felt
in
america
did
maryland
make
any
attempt
to
restrain
a
trade
from
which
she
had
long
enjoyed
a
comfortable
revenue
the
act
of
laying
a
duty
of
may
have
been
a
mild
restrictive
measure
the
duties
were
slowly
increased
to
in
and
in
in
a
prohibitive
duty
of
was
laid
and
in
after
the
war
all
importation
by
sea
was
stopped
and
illegally
imported
negroes
were
freed
compared
with
the
trade
to
virginia
and
the
carolinas
the
to
maryland
was
small
and
seems
at
no
time
to
have
reached
proportions
which
alarmed
the
inhabitants
it
was
regulated
to
the
economic
demand
by
a
slowly
increasing
tariff
and
finally
after
had
nearly
ceased
of
its
own
accord
before
the
restrictive
legislation
of
revolutionary
times
probably
the
proximity
of
maryland
to
virginia
made
an
independent
less
necessary
to
her
character
of
these
we
find
in
the
planting
colonies
all
degrees
of
advocacy
of
the
trade
from
the
passiveness
of
maryland
to
the
clamor
of
georgia
opposition
to
the
trade
did
not
appear
in
georgia
was
based
almost
solely
on
political
fear
of
insurrection
in
carolina
and
sprang
largely
from
the
same
motive
in
virginia
mingled
with
some
moral
repugnance
as
a
whole
it
may
be
said
that
whatever
opposition
to
the
there
was
in
the
planting
colonies
was
based
principally
on
the
political
fear
of
insurrection

physical
characteristics

circumstances
of
settlement
slavery
as
an
institution
found
but
a
narrow
field
for
development
the
climate
was
generally
rather
cool
for
the
newly
imported
slaves
the
soil
was
best
suited
to
crops
to
which
slave
labor
was
poorly
adapted
and
the
training
and
habits
of
the
great
body
of
settlers
offered
little
chance
for

growth
of
a

system
these
conditions
varied

in

colonies
but
the
general
statement
applies
to
all
these
communities
of
small
farmers
and
traders
derived
whatever
opposition
they
had
to
the
from
three
sorts
of
motives
economic
political
and
moral
first
the
importation
of
slaves
did
not
pay
except
to
supply
a
moderate
demand
for
household
servants
secondly
these
colonies
as
well
as
those
in
the
south
had
a
wholesome
political
fear
of
a
large
servile
population
thirdly
the
settlers
of
many
of
these
colonies
were
of
sterner
moral
fibre
than
the
southern
cavaliers
and
adventurers
and
in
the
absence
of
great
counteracting
motives
were
more
easily
led
to
oppose
the
institution
and
the
trade
finally
it
must
be
noted
that
these
colonies
did
not
so
generally
regard
themselves
as
temporary
commercial
investments
as
did
virginia
and
carolina
intending
to
found
permanent
states

amsterdam
was
begun
in
in
the
private
companies
trading
in
the
west
were
all
merged
into
the
dutch
west
india
company
and
given
a
monopoly
of
american
trade
this
company
was
very
active
sending
in
four
years
negroes
to
brazil
carrying
on
war
with
spain
supplying
even
the
english
plantations
and
gradually
becoming
the
great
slave
carrier
of
the
day
the
commercial
supremacy
of
the
dutch
early
excited
the
envy
and
emulation
of
the
english
the
navigation
ordinance
of
was
aimed
at
them
and
two
wars
were
necessary
to
wrest
the
from
them
and
place
it
in
the
hands
of
the
english
the
final
terms
of
peace
among
other
things
surrendered
new
netherland
to
england
and
opened
the
way
for
england
to
become
henceforth
the
world
greatest
although
the
dutch
had
thus
commenced
the
continental
they
had
not
actually
furnished
a
very
large
number
of
slaves
to
the
english
colonies
outside
the
west
indies
a
small
trade
had
by
brought
a
few
thousand
to
new
york
and
still
fewer
to
new
jersey
it
was
left
to
the
english
with
their
strong
policy
in
its
favor
to
develop
this
trade
in
new
the
early
ordinances
of
the
dutch
laying
duties
generally
of
ten
per
cent
on
slaves
probably
proved
burdensome
to
the
trade
although
this
was
not
intentional
the
biblical
prohibition
of
slavery
and
the
copied
from
new
england
codes
into
the
duke
of
york
laws
had
no
practical
application
and
the
trade
continued
to
be
encouraged
in
the
governors
instructions
in
a
duty
of
was
laid
on
negroes
from
elsewhere
than
africa
this
was
aimed
at
west
india
slaves
and
was
prohibitive
by
the
duty
on
all
slaves
was
which
was
probably
a
mere
revenue
figure
in
a
duty
of
was
laid
to
be
continued
until
it
proved
restrictive
however
and
on
the
humble
petition
of
the
merchants
and
traders
of
the
city
of
bristol
was
disallowed
in
as
greatly
prejudicial
to
the
trade
and
navigation
of
this
kingdom
governor
cosby
was
also
reminded
that
no
duties
on
slaves
payable
by
the
importer
were
to
be
laid
later
in
the
duty
was
restored
but
under
the
increased
trade
of
those
days
was
not
felt
no
further
restrictions
seem
to
have
been
attempted
until
when
the
sale
of
slaves
in
the
state
was
forbidden
the
chief
element
of
restriction
in
this
colony
appears
to
have
been
the
shrewd
business
sense
of
the
traders
who
never
flooded
the
slave
market
but
kept
a
supply
sufficient
for
the
slowly
growing
demand
between
and
only
about
slaves
were
imported
and
in
the
total
slave
population
amounted
to
no
restriction
was
ever
put
by
new
york
on
participation
in
the
trade
outside
the
colony
and
in
spite
of
national
laws
new
york
merchants
continued
to
be
engaged
in
this
traffic
even
down
to
the
civil
war
vermont
who
withdrew
from
new
york
in
in
her
first
constitution
declared
slavery
illegal
and
in
stopped
by
law
the
sale
and
transportation
of
slaves
within
her
boundaries
in
pennsylvania
and
one
of
the
first
american
protests
against
the
came
from
certain
german
friends
in
at
a
weekly
meeting
held
in
germantown
pennsylvania
these
are
the
reasons
wrote
garret
henderich
derick
up
de
graeff
francis
daniell
pastorius
and
abraham
up
den
graef
why
we
are
against
the
traffick
of
as
followeth
is
there
any
that
would
be
done
or
handled
at
this
manner
now
tho
they
are
black
we
can
not
conceive
there
is
more
liberty
to
have
them
slaves
as
it
is
to
have
other
white
ones
there
is
a
saying
that
we
shall
doe
to
all
men
like
as
we
will
be
done
ourselves
making
no
difference
of
what
generation
descent
or
colour
they
are
and
those
who
steal
or
robb
men
and
those
who
buy
or
purchase
them
are
they
not
all
alike
this
little
leaven
helped
slowly
to
work
a
revolution
in
the
attitude
of
this
great
sect
toward
slavery
and
the
the
yearly
meeting
at
first
postponed
the
matter
it
having
so
general
a
relation
to
many
other
parts
eventually
however
in
the
yearly
meeting
advised
that
friends
be
careful
not
to
encourage
the
bringing
in
of
any
more
negroes
this
advice
was
repeated
in
stronger
terms
for
a
and
by
that
time
sandiford
benezet
lay
and
woolman
had
begun
their
crusade
in
the
friends
took
a
step
farther
and
made
the
purchase
of
slaves
a
matter
of
discipline
four
years
later
the
yearly
meeting
expressed
itself
clearly
as
against
every
branch
of
this
practice
and
declared
that
if
any
professing
with
us
should
persist
to
vindicate
it
and
be
concerned
in
importing
selling
or
purchasing
slaves
the
respective
monthly
meetings
to
which
they
belong
should
manifest
their
disunion
with
such
persons
further
manumission
was
recommended
and
in
made
compulsory
the
effect
of
this
attitude
of
the
friends
was
early
manifested
in
the
legislation
of
all
the
colonies
where
the
sect
was
influential
and
particularly
in
pennsylvania
one
of
the
first
duty
acts
laid
a
restrictive
duty
of
on
slaves
and
was
eventually
disallowed
in
william
southeby
petitioned
the
assembly
totally
to
abolish
slavery
this
the
assembly
naturally
refused
to
attempt
but
the
same
year
in
response
to
another
petition
signed
by
many
hands
they
passed
an
act
to
prevent
the
importation
of
negroes
and
indians
the
first
enactment
of
its
kind
in
america
this
act
was
inspired
largely
by
the
general
fear
of
insurrection
which
succeeded
the
of
in
new
york
it
declared
whereas
divers
plots
and
insurrections
have
frequently
happened
not
only
in
the
islands
but
on
the
main
land
of
by
negroes
which
have
been
carried
on
so
far
that
several
of
the
inhabitants
have
been
barbarously
murthered
an
instance
whereof
we
have
lately
had
in
our
neighboring
colony
of
etc
it
then
proceeded
to
lay
a
prohibitive
duty
of
on
all
slaves
imported
these
acts
were
quickly
disposed
of
in
england
three
duty
acts
affecting
negroes
including
the
prohibitory
act
were
in
disallowed
and
it
was
directed
that
the
ty
r
council
and
assembly
of
pensilvania
be
they
are
hereby
strictly
enjoyned
required
not
to
permit
the
said
laws
to
be
from
henceforward
put
in
execution
the
assembly
repealed
these
laws
but
in
passed
another
laying
a
duty
of
which
was
also
eventually
disallowed
other
acts
the
provisions
of
which
are
not
clear
were
passed
in
and
and
in
the
duty
on
negroes
was
raised
to
the
restrictive
figure
of
this
duty
for
some
reason
not
apparent
was
lowered
to
in
but
restored
again
in
a
struggle
occurred
over
this
last
measure
the
friends
petitioning
for
it
and
the
philadelphia
merchants
against
it
declaring
that
we
the
subscribers
ever
desirous
to
extend
the
trade
of
this
province
have
seen
for
some
time
past
the
many
inconveniencys
the
inhabitants
have
suffer
for
want
of
labourers
and
artificers
have
for
some
time
encouraged
the
importation
of
negroes
they
prayed
therefore
at
least
for
a
delay
in
passing
the
measure
the
law
nevertheless
after
much
debate
and
altercation
with
the
governor
finally
passed
these
repeated
acts
nearly
stopped
the
trade
and
the
manumission
or
sale
of
negroes
by
the
friends
decreased
the
number
of
slaves
in
the
province
the
rising
spirit
of
independence
enabled
the
colony
in
to
restore
the
prohibitive
duty
of
and
make
it
perpetual
after
the
revolution
unpaid
duties
on
slaves
were
collected
and
the
slaves
registered
and
in
an
act
for
the
gradual
abolition
of
slavery
was
passed
as
there
were
probably
at
no
time
before
the
war
more
than
slaves
in
pennsylvania
the
task
thus
accomplished
was
not
so
formidable
as
in
many
other
states
as
it
was
participation
in
the
outside
the
colony
was
not
prohibited
until
it
seems
probable
that
in
the
original
swedish
settlements
along
the
delaware
slavery
was
prohibited
this
measure
had
however
little
practical
effect
for
as
soon
as
the
dutch
got
control
the
was
opened
although
as
it
appears
to
no
large
extent
after
the
fall
of
the
dutch
delaware
came
into
english
hands
not
until
do
we
find
any
legislation
on
the
in
that
year
the
colony
attempted
to
prohibit
the
importation
of
slaves
but
the
governor
vetoed
the
bill
finally
in
by
the
constitution
and
in
by
law
importation
and
exportation
were
both
prohibited
in
new
although
the
freeholders
of
west
new
jersey
declared
in
that
all
and
every
person
and
persons
inhabiting
the
said
province
shall
as
far
as
in
us
lies
be
free
from
oppression
and
slavery
yet
negro
slaves
are
early
found
in
the
colony
the
first
restrictive
measure
was
passed
after
considerable
friction
between
the
council
and
the
house
in
it
laid
a
duty
of
currency
governor
hunter
explained
to
the
board
of
trade
that
the
bill
was
calculated
to
encourage
the
importation
of
white
servants
for
the
better
peopeling
that
country
how
long
this
act
continued
does
not
appear
probably
not
long
no
further
legislation
was
enacted
until
or
when
a
prohibitive
duty
was
laid
on
account
of
the
inconvenience
the
province
is
exposed
to
in
lying
open
to
the
free
importation
of
negros
when
the
provinces
on
each
side
have
laid
duties
on
them
the
board
of
trade
declared
that
while
they
did
not
object
to
the
policy
of
imposing
a
reasonable
duty
they
could
not
assent
to
this
and
the
act
was
disallowed
the
act
of
evaded
the
technical
objection
of
the
board
of
trade
and
laid
a
duty
of
on
the
first
purchasers
of
negroes
because
as
the
act
declared
duties
on
the
importation
of
negroes
in
several
of
the
neighbouring
colonies
hath
on
experience
been
found
beneficial
in
the
introduction
of
sober
industrious
foreigners
in
a
bill
which
according
to
the
report
of
the
council
to
governor
morris
plainly
intended
an
entire
prohibition
of
all
slaves
being
imported
from
foreign
parts
was
thrown
out
by
the
council
importation
was
finally
prohibited
in
character
of
these
the
main
difference
in
motive
between
the
restrictions
which
the
planting
and
the
farming
colonies
put
on
the
african
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
former
limited
it
mainly
from
fear
of
insurrection
the
latter
mainly
because
it
did
not
pay
naturally
the
latter
motive
worked
itself
out
with
much
less
legislation
than
the
former
for
this
reason
and
because
they
held
a
smaller
number
of
slaves
most
of
these
colonies
have
fewer
actual
statutes
than
the
southern
colonies
in
pennsylvania
alone
did
this
general
economic
revolt
against
the
trade
acquire
a
distinct
moral
tinge
although
even
here
the
institution
was
naturally
doomed
yet
the
clear
moral
insight
of
the
quakers
checked
the
trade
much
earlier
than
would
otherwise
have
happened
we
may
say
then
that
the
farming
colonies
checked
the
primarily
from
economic
motives

rigorous
climate
of
new
england
the
character
of
her
settlers
and
their
pronounced
political
views
gave
slavery
an
even
slighter
basis
here
than
in
the
middle
colonies
the
significance
of
new
england
in
the
african
does
not
therefore
lie
in
the
fact
that
she
early
discountenanced
the
system
of
slavery
and
stopped
importation
but
rather
in
the
fact
that
her
citizens
being
the
traders
of
the
new
world
early
took
part
in
the
carrying
and
furnished
slaves
to
the
other
colonies
an
inquiry
therefore
into
the
efforts
of
the
new
england
colonies
to
suppress
the
would
fall
naturally
into
two
parts
first
and
chiefly
an
investigation
of
the
efforts
to
stop
the
participation
of
citizens
in
the
carrying
secondly
an
examination
of
the
efforts
made
to
banish
the
from
new
england
soil
england
and
the
vessels
from
massachusetts
rhode
island
connecticut
and
to
a
less
extent
from
new
hampshire
were
early
and
largely
engaged
in
the
carrying
we
know
said
thomas
pemberton
in
that
a
large
trade
to
guinea
was
carried
on
for
many
years
by
the
citizens
of
massachusetts
colony
who
were
the
proprietors
of
the
vessels
and
their
cargoes
out
and
home
some
of
the
slaves
purchased
in
guinea
and
i
suppose
the
greatest
part
of
them
were
sold
in
the
west
indies
john
eliot
asserted
that
it
made
a
considerable
branch
of
our
commerce
it
declined
very
little
till
the
revolution
yet
the
trade
of
this
colony
was
said
not
to
equal
that
of
rhode
island
newport
was
the
mart
for
slaves
offered
for
sale
in
the
north
and
a
point
of
reshipment
for
all
slaves
it
was
principally
this
trade
that
raised
newport
to
her
commercial
importance
in
the
eighteenth
century
connecticut
too
was
an
important
sending
large
numbers
of
horses
and
other
commodities
to
the
west
indies
in
exchange
for
slaves
and
selling
the
slaves
in
other
colonies
this
trade
formed
a
perfect
circle
owners
of
slavers
carried
slaves
to
south
carolina
and
brought
home
naval
stores
for
their
or
to
the
west
indies
and
brought
home
molasses
or
to
other
colonies
and
brought
home
hogsheads
the
molasses
was
made
into
the
highly
prized
new
england
rum
and
shipped
in
these
hogsheads
to
africa
for
more
slaves
thus
the
industry
indicates
to
some
extent
the
activity
of
new
england
in
the
in
may
one
captain
freeman
found
so
many
slavers
fitting
out
that
in
spite
of
the
large
importations
of
molasses
he
could
get
no
rum
for
his
vessel
in
newport
alone
stills
were
at
one
time
running
continuously
and
massachusetts
annually
distilled
hogsheads
of
molasses
into
this
chief
manufacture
turning
now
to
restrictive
measures
we
must
first
note
the
measures
of
the
colonies
which
tended
to
limit
the
trade
these
measures
however
came
comparatively
late
were
enforced
with
varying
degrees
of
efficiency
and
did
not
seriously
affect
the
before
the
revolution
the
moral
sentiment
of
new
england
put
some
check
upon
the
trade
although
in
earlier
times
the
most
respectable
people
took
ventures
in
voyages
yet
there
gradually
arose
a
moral
sentiment
which
tended
to
make
the
business
somewhat
disreputable
in
the
line
however
of
definite
legal
enactments
to
stop
new
england
citizens
from
carrying
slaves
from
africa
to
any
place
in
the
world
there
were
before
the
revolution
none
indeed
not
until
the
years
was
in
itself
an
indictable
offence
in
any
new
england
state
the
particular
situation
in
each
colony
and
the
efforts
to
restrict
the
small
importing
of
new
england
can
best
be
studied
in
a
separate
view
of
each
community
in
new
the
statistics
of
slavery
in
new
hampshire
show
how
weak
an
institution
it
always
was
in
that
colony
consequently
when
the
usual
instructions
were
sent
to
governor
wentworth
as
to
the
encouragement
he
must
give
to
the
the
house
replied
we
have
considered
his
ties
instruction
relating
to
an
impost
on
negroes
felons
to
which
this
house
answers
that
there
never
was
any
duties
laid
on
either
by
this
t
and
so
few
in
that
it
would
not
be
worth
the
publick
notice
so
as
to
make
an
act
concerning
them
this
remained
true
for
the
whole
history
of
the
colony
importation
was
never
stopped
by
actual
enactment
but
was
eventually
declared
contrary
to
the
constitution
of
the
participation
of
citizens
in
the
trade
appears
never
to
have
been
forbidden
in
the
early
biblical
codes
of
massachusetts
confined
slavery
to
lawfull
captives
taken
in
iust
warres
such
strangers
as
willingly
selle
themselves
or
are
sold
to
us
the
stern
puritanism
of
early
days
endeavored
to
carry
this
out
literally
and
consequently
when
a
certain
captain
smith
about
attacked
an
african
village
and
brought
some
of
the
unoffending
natives
home
he
was
promptly
arrested
eventually
the
general
court
ordered
the
negroes
sent
home
at
the
colony
expense
conceiving
themselues
bound
by
first
oportunity
to
bear
witnes
against
haynos
crying
sinn
of
manstealing
as
also
to
such
timely
redresse
for
what
is
past
such
a
law
for
future
as
may
sufficiently
deterr
all
r
s
belonging
to
us
to
have
to
do
in
such
vile
most
odious
courses
iustly
abhored
of
all
good
iust
men
the
temptation
of
trade
slowly
forced
the
colony
from
this
high
moral
ground
new
england
ships
were
early
found
in
the
west
indian
and
the
more
the
carrying
trade
developed
the
more
did
the
profits
of
this
branch
of
it
attract
puritan
captains
by
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
was
openly
recognized
as
legitimate
commerce
cargoes
came
regularly
to
boston
and
the
merchants
of
boston
quoted
negroes
like
any
other
merchandise
demanded
by
their
correspondents
at
the
same
time
the
puritan
conscience
began
to
rebel
against
the
growth
of
actual
slavery
on
new
england
soil
it
was
a
much
less
violent
wrenching
of
moral
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
to
allow
massachusetts
men
to
carry
slaves
to
south
carolina
than
to
allow
cargoes
to
come
into
boston
and
become
slaves
in
massachusetts
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
therefore
opposition
arose
to
the
further
importation
of
negroes
and
in
an
act
for
the
better
preventing
of
a
spurious
and
mixt
issue
laid
a
restrictive
duty
of
on
all
slaves
imported
one
provision
of
this
act
plainly
illustrates
the
attitude
of
massachusetts
like
the
acts
of
many
of
the
new
england
colonies
it
allowed
a
rebate
of
the
whole
duty
on
the
harbors
of
new
england
were
thus
offered
as
a
free
for
slavers
all
the
duty
acts
of
the
southern
and
middle
colonies
allowed
a
rebate
of
or
of
the
duty
on
the
of
the
slave
thus
laying
a
small
tax
on
even
temporary
importation
the
act
of
was
evaded
but
it
was
not
amended
until
when
the
penalty
for
evasion
was
raised
to
the
act
remained
in
force
except
possibly
for
one
period
of
four
years
until
meantime
the
movement
against
importation
grew
a
bill
for
preventing
the
importation
of
slaves
into
this
province
was
introduced
in
the
legislature
in
but
after
strong
opposition
and
disagreement
between
house
and
council
it
was
dropped
in
the
struggle
was
renewed
a
similar
bill
passed
but
was
vetoed
by
governor
hutchinson
the
imminent
war
and
the
discussions
incident
to
it
had
now
more
and
more
aroused
public
opinion
and
there
were
repeated
attempts
to
gain
executive
consent
to
a
prohibitory
law
in
such
a
bill
was
twice
passed
but
never
received
assent
the
new
revolutionary
government
first
met
the
subject
in
the
case
of
two
negroes
captured
on
the
high
seas
who
were
advertised
for
sale
at
salem
a
resolution
was
introduced
into
the
legislature
directing
the
release
of
the
negroes
and
declaring
that
the
selling
and
enslaving
the
human
species
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
natural
rights
alike
vested
in
all
men
by
their
creator
and
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
avowed
principles
on
which
this
and
the
other
united
states
have
carried
their
struggle
for
liberty
even
to
the
last
appeal
to
this
the
council
would
not
consent
and
the
resolution
as
finally
passed
merely
forbade
the
sale
or
of
the
negroes
committees
on
the
slavery
question
were
appointed
in
and
and
although
a
letter
to
congress
on
the
matter
and
a
bill
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
were
reported
no
decisive
action
was
taken
all
such
efforts
were
finally
discontinued
as
the
system
was
already
practically
extinct
in
massachusetts
and
the
custom
of
importation
had
nearly
ceased
slavery
was
eventually
declared
by
judicial
decision
to
have
been
abolished
the
first
step
toward
stopping
the
participation
of
massachusetts
citizens
in
the
outside
the
state
was
taken
in
when
a
committee
of
inquiry
was
appointed
by
the
legislature
no
act
was
however
passed
until
when
participation
in
the
trade
was
prohibited
on
pain
of
forfeit
for
every
slave
and
for
every
ship
engaged
in
rhode
in
rhode
island
passed
a
law
designed
to
prohibit
life
slavery
in
the
colony
it
declared
that
whereas
there
is
a
common
course
practised
amongst
english
men
to
buy
negers
to
that
end
they
may
have
them
for
service
or
slaves
forever
for
the
preventinge
of
such
practices
among
us
let
it
be
ordered
that
no
blacke
mankind
or
white

forced
by
covenant
bond
or
otherwise
to
serve
any
man
or
his
assighnes

at
the
end

terme
of

the
manner
is
with
the
english
servants

that
they
may
bee
enslaved
to
others
for
a
long
time
hee
or
they
shall
forfeit
to
the
collonie
forty
pounds
this
law
was
for
a
time
enforced
but
by
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
had
either
been
repealed
or
become
a
dead
letter
for
the
act
of
recognized
perpetual
slavery
and
laid
an
impost
of
on
negroes
imported
this
duty
was
really
a
tax
on
the
transport
trade
and
produced
a
steady
income
for
twenty
years
from
the
year
on
the
citizens
of
this
state
engaged
more
and
more
in
the
carrying
trade
until
rhode
island
became
the
greatest
in
america

she
did
not
import
many
slaves
for
her
own
use
she
became

the
trade
of
other
colonies
governor
cranston
as
early
as
reported
that
between
and
one
hundred
and
three
vessels
were
built
in
the
state
all
of
which
were
trading
to
the
west
indies
and
the
southern
colonies
they
took
out
lumber
and
brought
back
molasses

most
cases

a
slave
voyage
in
between

this
the
trade
grew
samuel
hopkins
about
was
shocked
at
the
state
of
the
trade
more
than
thirty
distilleries
were
running
in
the
colony
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
vessels
were
in
the
rhode
island
said
he
has
been
more
deeply
interested
in
the
and
has
enslaved
more
africans
than
any
other
colony
in
new
england
later
in
he
wrote
the
inhabitants
of
rhode
island
especially
those
of
newport
have
had
by
far
the
greater
share
in
this
traffic
of
all
these
united
states
this
trade
in
human
species
has
been
the
first
wheel
of
commerce
in
newport
on
which
every
other
movement
in
business
has
chiefly
depended
that
town
has
been
built
up
and
flourished
in
times
past
at
the
expense
of
the
blood
the
liberty
and
happiness
of
the
poor
africans
and
the
inhabitants
have
lived
on
this
and
by
it
have
gotten
most
of
their
wealth
and
riches
the
act
of
was
poorly
enforced
the
good
intentions
of
its
framers
were
wholly
frustrated
by
the
clandestine
hiding
and
conveying
said
negroes
out
of
the
town
newport
into
the
country
where
they
lie
concealed
the
act
was
accordingly
strengthened
by
the
acts
of
and
and
made
to
apply
to
importations
by
land
as
well
as
by
sea
the
act
of
however
favored
the
trade
by
admitting
african
negroes
free
of
duty
the
chaotic
state
of
rhode
island
did
not
allow
england
often
to
review
her
legislation
but
as
soon
as
the
act
of
came
to
notice
it
was
disallowed
and
accordingly
repealed
in
whether
the
act
of
remained
or
whether
any
other
duty
act
was
passed
is
not
clear
while
the
foreign
trade
was
flourishing
the
influence
of
the
friends
and
of
other
causes
eventually
led
to
a
movement
against
slavery
as
a
local
institution
abolition
societies
multiplied
and
in
an
abolition
bill
was
ordered
by
the
assembly
but
it
was
never
passed
four
years
later
the
city
of
providence
resolved
that
as
personal
liberty
is
an
essential
part
of
the
natural
rights
of
mankind
the
importation
of
slaves
and
the
system
of
slavery
should
cease
in
the
colony
this
movement
finally
resulted
in
in
an
act
prohibiting
the
importation
of
negroes
into
this
colony
a
law
which
curiously
illustrated
the
attitude
of
rhode
island
toward
the
the
preamble
of
the
act
declared
whereas
the
inhabitants
of
america
are
generally
engaged
in
the
preservation
of
their
own
rights
and
liberties
among
which
that
of
personal
freedom
must
be
considered
as
the
greatest
as
those
who
are
desirous
of
enjoying
all
the
advantages
of
liberty
themselves
should
be
willing
to
extend
personal
liberty
to
others
therefore
etc
the
statute
then
proceeded
to
enact
that
for
the
future
no
negro
or
mulatto
slave
shall
be
brought
into
this
colony
and
in
case
any
slave
shall
hereafter
be
brought
in
he
or
she
shall
be
and
are
hereby
rendered
immediately
free
the
logical
ending
of
such
an
act
would
have
been
a
clause
prohibiting
the
participation
of
rhode
island
citizens
in
the
not
only
was
such
a
clause
omitted
but
the
following
was
inserted
instead
provided
also
that
nothing
in
this
act
shall
extend
or
be
deemed
to
extend
to
any
negro
or
mulatto
slave
brought
from
the
coast
of
africa
into
the
west
indies
on
board
any
vessel
belonging
to
this
colony
and
which
negro
or
mulatto
slave
could
not
be
disposed
of
in
the
west
indies
but
shall
be
brought
into
this
colony
provided
that
the
owner
of
such
negro
or
mulatto
slave
give
bond
that
such
negro
or
mulatto
slave
shall
be
exported
out
of
the
colony
within
one
year
from
the
date
of
such
bond
if
such
negro
or
mulatto
be
alive
and
in
a
condition
to
be
removed
in
an
act
to
prevent
the
sale
of
slaves
out
of
the
state
was
passed
and
in
an
act
gradually
to
abolish
slavery
not
until
did
an
act
pass
to
forbid
participation
in
the
this
law
laid
a
penalty
of
for
every
slave
transported
and
for
every
vessel
so
engaged
in
connecticut
in
common
with
the
other
colonies
of
this
section
had
a
trade
for
many
years
with
the
west
indian
slave
markets
and
though
this
trade
was
much
smaller
than
that
of
the
neighboring
colonies
yet
many
of
her
citizens
were
engaged
in
it
a
map
of
middletown
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
gives
among
one
hundred
families
three
slave
captains
and
three
notables
designated
as
the
actual
importation
was
small
and
almost
entirely
unrestricted
before
the
revolution
save
by
a
few
light
general
duty
acts
in
the
further
importation
of
slaves
was
prohibited
because
the
increase
of
slaves
in
this
colony
is
injurious
to
the
poor
and
inconvenient
the
law
prohibited
importation
under
any
pretext
by
a
penalty
of
per
slave
this
was
in
and
provisions
were
made
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
participation
in
the
trade
was
forbidden
and
the
penalty
placed
at
for
each
slave
and
for
each
ship
engaged
character
of
these
enough
has
already
been
said
to
show
in
the
main
the
character
of
the
opposition
to
the
in
new
england
the
system
of
slavery
had
on
this
soil
and
amid
these
surroundings
no
economic
justification
and
the
small
number
of
negroes
here
furnished
no
political
arguments
against
them
the
opposition
to
the
importation
was
therefore
from
the
first
based
solely
on
moral
grounds
with
some
social
arguments
as
to
the
carrying
trade
however
the

certain
general
movements
first
from
to
there
was
a
tendency
to
take
a
high
moral
stand
against
the

this
is
illustrated
in

in
the
plans
for
the
settlement
of
delaware
and
later
that
of

and
in

the
second
period
from

to
has
no

is
marked
by
statutes
laying
duties
varying
in
design
from
encouragement

by

steady
growth
of
a
spirit
unfavorable
to
the
long
continuance
of
the
trade
the
last
colonial
period
from
about
to
is
one
of
pronounced
effort
to
regulate
limit
or
totally
prohibit
the
traffic
beside
these
general
movements
there
are
many
waves
of
legislation
easily
distinguishable
which
rolled
over
several
or
all
of
the
colonies
at
various
times
such
as
the
series
of
high
duties
following
the
assiento
and
the
acts
inspired
by
various
negro
plots
notwithstanding
this
the
laws
of

before
had
no
national
unity
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
each
colony
determining
its
legislation
with

outbreak
of

revolution
came
unison
in
action
with
regard
to
the
as
with
regard
to
other
matters
which
may
justly
be
called
national
it
was
of
course
a
critical
period
a
period
when
in
the
rapid
upheaval
of
a
few
years
the
complicated
and
diverse
forces
of
decades
meet
combine
act
and
react
until
the
resultant
seems
almost
the
work
of
chance
in
the
settlement
of
the
fate
of
slavery
and
the
however
the
real
crisis
came
in
the
calm
that
succeeded
the
storm
in
that
day
when
in
the
opinion
of
most
men
the
question
seemed
already
settled
and
indeed
it
needed
an
exceptionally
clear
and
discerning
mind
in
to
deny
that
slavery
and
the
in
the
united
states
of
america
were
doomed
to
early
annihilation
it
seemed
certainly
a
legitimate
deduction
from
the
history
of
the
preceding
century
to
conclude
that
as
the
system
had
risen
flourished
and
fallen
in
massachusetts
new
york
and
pennsylvania
and
as
south
carolina
virginia
and
maryland
were
apparently
following
in
the
same
legislative
path
the
next
generation
would
in
all
probability
witness
the
last
throes
of
the
system
on
our
soil
to
be
sure
the
problem
had
its
uncertain
quantities
the
motives
of
the
in
south
carolina
and
pennsylvania
were
dangerously
different
the
century
of
industrial
expansion
was
slowly
dawning
and
awakening
that
vast
economic
revolution
in
which
american
slavery
was
to
play
so
prominent
and
fatal
a
rôle
and
finally
there
were
already
in
the
south
faint
signs
of
a
changing
moral
attitude
toward
slavery
which
would
no
longer
regard
the
system
as
a
temporary
makeshift
but
rather
as
a
permanent
though
perhaps
unfortunate
necessity
with
regard
to
the
however
there
appeared
to
be
substantial
unity
of
opinion
and
there
were
in
few
things
to
indicate
that
a
cargo
of
five
hundred
african
slaves
would
openly
be
landed
in
georgia
in
condition
of
the
in
england
the
chief
nation
was
sending
on
an
average
to
africa
ships
annually
with
a
tonnage
of
tons
carrying
exports
to
the
value
of
only
about
twenty
of
these
ships
regularly
returned
to
england
most
of
them
carried
slaves
to
the
west
indies
and
returned
laden
with
sugar
and
other
products
thus
may
be
formed
some
idea
of
the
size
and
importance
of
the
at
that
time
although
for
a
complete
view
we
must
add
to
this
the
trade
under
the
french
portuguese
dutch
and
americans
the
trade
fell
off
somewhat
toward
but
was
flourishing
again
when
the
revolution
brought
a
sharp
and
serious
check
upon
it
bringing
down
the
number
of
english
slavers
clearing
from
in
to
in
and
the
tonnage
from
to
tons
after
the
war
the
trade
gradually
recovered
and
by
had
reached
nearly
its
former
extent
in
the
british
west
indies
received
negroes
from
africa
and
by
the
importation
had
increased
to
in
this
latter
year
it
was
estimated
that
the
british
were
taking
annually
from
africa
slaves
the
french
the
portuguese
the
dutch
and
danes
a
total
of
manchester
alone
sent
annually
in
goods
to
africa
in
exchange
for
negroes
and
the
association
at
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
six
main
reasons
some
of
which
were
old
and
of
slow
growth
others
peculiar
to
the
abnormal
situation
of
that
time
led
to
concerted
action
against
the
the
first
reason
was
the
economic
failure
of
slavery
in
the
middle
and
eastern
colonies
this
gave
rise
to
the
presumption
that
like
failure
awaited
the
institution
in
the
south
secondly
the
new
philosophy
of
freedom
and
the
rights
of
man
which
formed
the
of
the
revolution
made
the
dullest
realize
that
at
the
very
least
the
and
a
struggle
for
liberty
were
not
consistent
thirdly
the
old
fear
of
slave
insurrections
which
had
long
played
so
prominent
a
part
in
legislation
now
gained
new
power
from
the
imminence
of
war
and
from
the
fear
that
the
british
might
incite
servile
uprisings
fourthly
nearly
all
the
american
slave
markets
were
in
overstocked
with
slaves
and
consequently
many
of
the
strongest
partisans
of
the
system
were
bulls
on
the
market
and
desired
to
raise
the
value
of
their
slaves
by
at
least
a
temporary
stoppage
of
the
trade
fifthly
since
the
vested
interests
of
the
merchants
were
liable
to
be
swept
away
by
the
opening
of
hostilities
and
since
the
price
of
slaves
was
low
there
was
from
this
quarter
little
active
opposition
to
a
cessation
of
the
trade
for
a
season
finally
it
was
long
a
favorite
belief
of
the
supporters
of
the
revolution
that
as
english
exploitation
of
colonial
resources
had
caused
the
quarrel
the
best
weapon
to
bring
england
to
terms
was
the
economic
expedient
of
stopping
all
commercial
intercourse
with
her
since
then
the
had
ever
formed
an
important
part
of
her
colonial
traffic
it
was
one
of
the
first
branches
of
commerce
which
occurred
to
the
colonists
as
especially
suited
to
their
ends
such
were
the
complicated
moral
political
and
economic
motives
which
underlay
the
first
national
action
against
the
this
action
was
taken
by
the
association
a
union
of
the
colonies
entered
into
to
enforce
the
policy
of
stopping
commercial
intercourse
with
england
the
movement
was
not
a
great
moral
protest
against
an
iniquitous
traffic
although
it
had
undoubtedly
a
strong
moral
backing
it
was
primarily
a
temporary
war
measure
action
of
the
the
earlier
and
largely
abortive
attempts
to
form
associations
generally
did
not
mention
slaves
specifically
although
the
virginia
house
of
burgesses
may
recommended
to
merchants
and
traders
among
other
things
to
agree
that
they
will
not
import
any
slaves
or
purchase
any
imported
after
the
first
day
of
november
next
until
the
said
acts
are
repealed

in
when
a
faneuil
hall
meeting
started
the
first
successful
national
attempt
at
the
being
at
the
time
especially
flourishing

more
attention

were
specifically

virginia
gave
the
especial
prominence
and
was
in
reality
the
leading
spirit
to
force
her
views
on
the
continental
congress
the
county
conventions
of
that
colony
first
took
up
the
subject
fairfax
county
thought
that
during
our
present
difficulties
and
distress
no
slaves
ought
to
be
imported
and
said
we
take
this
opportunity
of
declaring
our
most
earnest
wishes
to
see
an
entire
stop
forever
put
to
such
a
wicked
cruel
and
unnatural
trade
prince
george
and
nansemond
counties
resolved
that
the
trade
is
injurious
to
this
colony
obstructs
the
population
of
it
by
freemen
prevents
manufacturers
and
other
useful
emigrants
from
from
settling
amongst
us
and
occasions
an
annual
increase
of
the
balance
of
trade
against
this
colony
the
virginia
colonial
convention
august
also
declared
we
will
neither
ourselves
import
nor
purchase
any
slave
or
slaves
imported
by
any
other
person
after
the
first
day
of
next
either
from
the
or
any
other
place
in
south
carolina
at
the
convention
july
decided
opposition
to
the
scheme
was
manifested
though
how
much
this
was
due
to
the
interest
is
not
certain
many
of
the
delegates
wished
at
least
to
limit
the
powers
of
their
representatives
and
the
charleston
chamber
of
commerce
flatly
opposed
the
plan
of
an
association
finally
however
delegates
with
full
powers
were
sent
to
congress
the
arguments
leading
to
this
step
were
not
in
all
cases
on
the
score
of
patriotism
a
charleston
manifesto
argued
the
planters
are
greatly
in
arrears
to
the
merchants
a
stoppage
of
importation
would
give
them
all
an
opportunity
to
extricate
themselves
from
debt
the
merchants
would
have
time
to
settle
their
accounts
and
be
ready
with
the
return
of
liberty
to
renew
trade
action
of
the
continental
the
first
continental
congress
met
september
and
on
september
recommended
merchants
to
send
no
more
orders
for
foreign
goods
on
september
lee
made
a
motion
for
a
and
it
was
unanimously
resolved
to
import
no
goods
from
great
britain
after
december
afterward
ireland
and
the
west
indies
were
also
included
and
a
committee
consisting
of
low
of

mifflin

lee
of

and
johnson
of
connecticut
were
appointed
to
bring
in

plan
for
carrying

the
and
resolved
on
the
next
move
was
to
instruct
this
committee
to
include
in
the
proscribed
articles
among
other
things
molasses
coffee
or
piemento
from
the
plantations
or
from
a
motion
which
cut
deep
into
the
circle
of
commerce
and
aroused
some
opposition
will
can
the
people
bear
a
total
interruption
of
the

trade
asked
low
of
new
york
can
they
live
without
rum
sugar
and
molasses
will
not
this
impatience
and
vexation
defeat
the
measure
the
committee
finally
reported
october
and
after
three
discussion
and
amendment
the
proposal
passed
this
document
after
a
recital
of
grievances
declared
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
colonists
a
agreement
would
best
secure
redress
goods
from
great
britain
ireland
the
east
and
west
indies
and
dominica
were
excluded
and
it
was
resolved
that
we
will
neither
import
nor
purchase
any
slave
imported
after
the
first
day
of
next
after
which
time
we
will
wholly
discontinue
the
slave
trade
and
will
neither
be
concerned
in
it
ourselves
nor
will
we
hire
our
vessels
nor
sell
our
commodities
or
manufactures
to
those
who
are
concerned
in
it
strong
and
straightforward
as
this
resolution
was
time
unfortunately
proved
that
it
meant
very
little
two
years
later
in
this
same
congress
a
decided
opposition
was
manifested
to
branding
the
as
inhuman
and
it
was
thirteen
years
before
south
carolina
stopped
the
or
massachusetts
prohibited
her
citizens
from
engaging
in
it
the
passing
of
so
strong
a
resolution
must
be
explained
by
the
motives
before
given
by
the
character
of
the
drafting
committee
by
the
desire
of
america
in
this
crisis
to
appear
well
before
the
world
and
by
the
natural
moral
enthusiasm
aroused
by
the
imminence
of
a
great
national
struggle
of
the
the
unanimity
with
which
the
colonists
received
this
association
is
not
perhaps
as
remarkable
as
the
almost
entire
absence
of
comment
on
the
radical
clause
a
connecticut
in
december
noticed
with
singular
pleasure
the
second
article
of
the
association
in
which
it
is
agreed
to
import
no
more
negro
slaves
this
comment
appears
to
have
been
almost
the
only
one
there
were
in
various
places
some
evidences
of
disapproval
but
only
in
the
state
of
georgia
was
this
widespread
and
determined
and
based
mainly
on
the
clause
this
opposition
delayed
the
ratification
meeting
until
january
and
then
delegates
from
but
five
of
the
twelve
parishes
appeared
and
many
of
these
had
strong
instructions
against
the
approval
of
the
plan
before
this
meeting
could
act
the
governor
adjourned
it
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
represent
the
province
some
of
the
delegates
signed
an
agreement
one
article
of
which
promised
to
stop
the
importation
of
slaves
march
four
months
later
than
the
national
association
had
directed
this
was
not
of
course
binding
on
the
province
and
although
a
town
like
darien
might
declare
our
disapprobation
and
abhorrence
of
the
unnatural
practice
of
slavery
in
yet
the
powerful
influence
of
savannah
was
not
likely
soon
to
give
matters
a
favourable
turn
the
importers
were
mostly
against
any
interruption
and
the
consumers
very
much
divided
thus
the
efforts
of
this
assembly
failed
their
resolutions
being
almost
unknown
and
as
a
gentleman
writes
i
hope
for
the
honour
of
the
province
ever
will
remain
so
the
delegates
to
the
continental
congress
selected
by
this
rump
assembly
refused
to
take
their
seats
meantime
south
carolina
stopped
trade
with
georgia
because
it
hath
not
acceded
to
the
continental
association
and
the
single
georgia
parish
of
johns
appealed
to
the
second
continental
congress
to
except
it
from
the
general
boycott
of
the
colony
this
county
had
already
resolved
not
to
purchase
any
slave
imported
at
large
numbers
of
which
we
understand
are
there
expected
till
the
sense
of
congress
shall
be
made
known
to
us
may
congress
resolved
unanimously
that
all
exportations
to
the
island
of
except
the
parish
of
and
to
and
immediately
cease
these
measures
brought
the
refractory
colony
to
terms
and
the
provincial
congress
july
finally
adopted
the
association
and
resolved
among
other
things
that
we
will
neither
import
or
purchase
any
slave
imported
from
africa
or
elsewhere
after
this
day
the
agreement
was
in
the
beginning
at
least
well
enforced
by
the
voluntary
action
of
the
loosely
federated
nation
the
clause
seems
in
most
states
to
have
been
observed
with
the
others
in
south
carolina
a
cargo
of
near
three
hundred
slaves
was
sent
out
of
the
colony
by
the
consignee
as
being
interdicted
by
the
second
article
of
the
association
in
virginia
the
vigilance
committee
of
norfolk
hold
up
for
your
just
indignation
merchant
of
this
place
who
has
several
times
imported
slaves
from
jamaica
and
he
is
thus
publicly
censured
to
the
end
that
all
such
foes
to
the
rights
of
may
be
publickly
known
as
the
enemies
of
liberty
and
that
every
person
may
henceforth
break
off
all
dealings
with
him
of
the
the
strain
of
war
at
last
proved
too
much
for
this
voluntary
blockade
and
after
some
hesitancy
congress
april
resolved
to
allow
the
importation
of
articles
not
the
growth
or
manufacture
of
great
britain
except
tea
they
also
voted
that
no
slaves
be
imported
into
any
of
the
thirteen
united
colonies
this
marks
a
noticeable
change
of
attitude
from
the
strong
words
of
two
years
previous
the
former
was
a
definitive
promise
this
is
a
temporary
resolve
which
probably
represented
public
opinion
much
better
than
the
former
on
the
whole
the
conclusion
is
inevitably
forced
on
the
student
of
this
first
national
movement
against
the
that
its
influence
on
the
trade
was
but
temporary
and
insignificant
and
that
at
the
end
of
the
experiment
the
outlook
for
the
final
suppression
of
the
trade
was
little
brighter
than
before
the
whole
movement
served
as
a
sort
of
social
test
of
the
power
and
importance
of
the
which
proved
to
be
far
more
powerful
than
the
platitudes
of
many
of
the
revolutionists
had
assumed
the
effect
of
the
movement
on
the
in
general
was
to
begin
possibly
a
little
earlier
than
otherwise
would
have
been
the
case
that
temporary
breaking
up
of
the
trade
which
the
war
naturally
caused
there
was
a
time
during
the
late
war
says
clarkson
when
the
slave
trade
may
be
considered
as
having
been
nearly
abolished
the
prices
of
slaves
rose
correspondingly
high
so
that
smugglers
made
fortunes
it
is
stated
that
in
the
years
slave
merchants
of
liverpool
failed
for
the
sum
of
all
this
of
course
might
have
resulted
from
the
war
without
the
association
but
in
the
long
run
the
association
aided
in
frustrating
the
very
designs
which
the
framers
of
the
first
resolve
had
in
mind
for
the
temporary
stoppage
in
the
end
created
an
extraordinary
demand
for
slaves
and
led
to
a
after
the
war
nearly
as
large
as
that
before
and
public
opinion
after
the
the
declaration
of
independence
showed
a
significant
drift
of
public
opinion
from
the
firm
stand
taken
in
the
association
resolutions
the
clique
of
political
philosophers
to
which
jefferson
belonged
never
imagined
the
continued
existence
of
the
country
with
slavery
it
is
well
known
that
the
first
draft
of
the
declaration
contained
a
severe
arraignment
of
great
britain
as
the
real
promoter
of
slavery
and
the
in
america
in
it
the
king
was
charged
with
waging
cruel
war
against
human
nature
itself
violating
its
most
sacred
rights
of
life
and
liberty
in
the
persons
of
a
distant
people
who
never
offended
him
captivating
and
carrying
them
into
slavery
in
another
hemisphere
or
to
incur
miserable
death
in
their
transportation
thither
this
piratical
warfare
the
opprobrium
of
powers
is
the
warfare
of
the
king
of
great
britain
determined
to
keep
open
a
market
where
should
be
bought
and
sold
he
has
prostituted
his
negative
for
suppressing
every
legislative
attempt
to
prohibit
or
to
restrain
this
execrable
commerce
and
that
this
assemblage
of
horrors
might
want
no
fact
of
distinguished
die
he
is
now
exciting
those
very
people
to
rise
in
arms
among
us
and
to
purchase
that
liberty
of
which
he
has
deprived
them
by
murdering
the
people
on
whom
he
also
obtruded
them
thus
paying
off
former
crimes
committed
against
the
of
one
people
with
crimes
which
he
urges
them
to
commit
against
the
of
another
to
this
radical
and
not
strictly
truthful
statement
even
the
large
influence
of
the
virginia
leaders
could
not
gain
the
assent
of
the
delegates
in
congress
the
afflatus
of
was
rapidly
subsiding
and
changing
economic
conditions
had
already
led
many
to
look
forward
to
a
day
when
the
could
successfully
be
reopened
more
important
than
this
the
nation
as
a
whole
was
even
less
inclined
now
than
in
to
denounce
the
uncompromisingly
jefferson
himself
says
that
this
clause
was
struck
out
in
complaisance
to
south
carolina
and
georgia
who
had
never
attempted
to
restrain
the
importation
of
slaves
and
who
on
the
contrary
still
wished
to
continue
it
our
northern
brethren
also
i
believe
said
he
felt
a
little
tender
under
those
censures
for
though
their
people
had
very
few
slaves
themselves
yet
they
had
been
pretty
considerable
carriers
of
them
to
others
as
the
war
slowly
dragged
itself
to
a
close
it
became
increasingly
evident
that
a
firm
moral
stand
against
slavery
and
the
was
not
a
probability
the
reaction
which
naturally
follows
a
period
of
prolonged
and
exhausting
strife
for
high
political
principles
now
set
in
the
economic
forces
of
the
country
which
had
suffered
most
sought
to
recover
and
rearrange
themselves
and
all
the
selfish
motives
that
impelled
a
bankrupt
nation
to
seek
to
gain
its
daily
bread
did
not
long
hesitate
to
demand
a
reopening
of
the
profitable
african
this
demand
was
especially
urgent
from
the
fact
that
the
slaves
by
pillage
flight
and
actual
fighting
had
become
so
reduced
in
numbers
during
the
war
that
an
urgent
demand
for
more
laborers
was
felt
in
the
south
nevertheless
the
revival
of
the
trade
was
naturally
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
as
the
west
india
circuit
had
been
cut
off
leaving
no
resort
except
to
contraband
traffic
and
the
direct
african
trade
the
english
after
the
peace
returned
to
its
former
state
and
was
by
sending
slaves
annually
to
the
west
indies
just
how
large
the
trade
to
the
continent
was
at
this
time
there
are
few
means
of
ascertaining
it
is
certain
that
there
was
a
general
reopening
of
the
trade
in
the
carolinas
and
georgia
and
that
the
new
england
traders
participated
in
it
this
traffic
undoubtedly
reached
considerable
proportions
and
through
the
direct
african
trade
and
the
illicit
west
india
trade
many
thousands
of
negroes
came
into
the
united
states
during
the
years
meantime
there
was
slowly
arising
a
significant
divergence
of
opinion
on
the
subject
probably
the
whole
country
still
regarded
both
slavery
and
the
as
temporary
but
the
middle
states
expected
to
see
the
abolition
of
both
within
a
generation
while
the
south
scarcely
thought
it
probable
to
prohibit
even
the
in
that
short
time
such
a
difference
might
in
all
probability
have
been
satisfactorily
adjusted
if
both
parties
had
recognized
the
real
gravity
of
the
matter
as
it
was
both
regarded
it
as
a
problem
of
secondary
importance
to
be
solved
after
many
other
more
pressing
ones
had
been
disposed
of
the
men
had
seen
slavery
die
in
their
own
communities
and
expected
it
to
die
the
same
way
in
others
with
as
little
active
effort
on
their
own
part
the
southern
planters
born
and
reared
in
a
slave
system
thought
that
some
day
the
system
might
change
and
possibly
disappear
but
active
effort
to
this
end
on
their
part
was
ever
farthest
from
their
thoughts
here
then
began
that
fatal
policy
toward
slavery
and
the
that
characterized
the
nation
for
of
a
century
the
policy
of
action
of
the
the
was
hardly
touched
upon
in
the
congress
of
the
confederation
except
in
the
ordinance
respecting
the
capture
of
slaves
and
on
the
occasion
of
the
quaker
petition
against
the
trade
although
during
the
debate
on
the
articles
of
confederation
the
counting
of
slaves
as
well
as
of
freemen
in
the
apportionment
of
taxes
was
urged
as
a
measure
that
would
check
further
importation
of
negroes
it
is
our
duty
said
wilson
of
pennsylvania
to
lay
every
discouragement
on
the
importation
of
slaves
but
this
amendment
to
count
two
slaves
as
one
freeman
would
give
the
trium
to
him
who
would
import
slaves
the
matter
was
finally
compromised
by
apportioning
requisitions
according
to
the
value
of
land
and
buildings
after
the
articles
went
into
operation
an
ordinance
in
regard
to
the
recapture
of
fugitive
slaves
provided
that
if
the
capture
was
made
on
the
sea
below
mark
and
the
negro
was
not
claimed
he
should
be
freed
matthews
of
south
carolina
demanded
the
yeas
and
nays
on
this
proposition
with
the
result
that
only
the
vote
of
his
state
was
recorded
against
it
on
tuesday
october
a
deputation
from
the
yearly
meeting
of
the
pennsylvania
new
jersey
and
delaware
friends
asked
leave
to
present
a
petition
leave
was
granted
the
following
day
but
no
further
minute
appears
according
to
the
report
of
the
friends
the
petition
was
against
the
and
though
the
christian
rectitude
of
the
concern
was
by
the
delegates
generally
acknowledged
yet
not
being
vested
with
the
powers
of
legislation
they
declined
promoting
any
public
remedy
against
the
gross
national
iniquity
of
trafficking
in
the
persons
of
the
only
legislative
activity
in
regard
to
the
trade
during
the
confederation
was
taken
by
the
individual
states
before
connecticut
vermont
pennsylvania
delaware
and
virginia
had
by
law
stopped
the
further
importation
of
slaves
and
importation
had
practically
ceased
in
all
the
new
england
and
middle
states
including
maryland
in
consequence
of
the
revival
of
the
after
the
war
there
was
then
a
lull
in
state
activity
until
when
north
carolina
laid
a
prohibitive
duty
and
south
carolina
a
year
later
began
her
series
of
temporary
prohibitions
in
the
new
england
states
forbade
the
participation
of
their
citizens
in
the
traffic
it
was
this
wave
of
legislation
against
the
traffic

did
so
much
to
blind
the

days
luther
martin
of
maryland
precipitated
the
discussion
by
a
proposition
to
alter
the
section
so
as
to
allow
a
prohibition
or
tax
on
the
importation
of
slaves
the
debate
immediately
became
general
being
carried
on
principally
by
rutledge
the
pinckneys
and
williamson
from
the
carolinas
baldwin
of
georgia
mason
madison
and
randolph
of
virginia
wilson
and
gouverneur
morris
of
pennsylvania
dickinson
of
delaware
and
ellsworth
sherman
gerry
king
and
langdon
of
new
england
in
this
debate
the
moral
arguments
were
prominent
colonel
george
mason
of
virginia
denounced
the
traffic
in
slaves
as
infernal
luther
martin
of
maryland
regarded
it
as
inconsistent
with
the
principles
of
the
revolution
and
dishonorable
to
the
american
character
every
principle
of
honor
and
safety
declared
john
dickinson
of
delaware
demands
the
exclusion
of
slaves
indeed
mason
solemnly
averred
that
the
crime
of
slavery
might
yet
bring
the
judgment
of
god
on
the
nation
on
the
other
side
rutledge
of
south
carolina
bluntly
declared
that
religion
and
humanity
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
that
it
was
a
matter
of
interest
alone
gerry
of
massachusetts
wished
merely
to
refrain
from
giving
direct
sanction
to
the
trade
while
others
contented
themselves
with
pointing
out
the
inconsistency
of
condemning
the
and
defending
slavery
the
difficulty
of
the
whole
argument
from
the
moral
standpoint
lay
in
the
fact
that
it
was
completely
checkmated
by
the
obstinate
attitude
of
south
carolina
and
georgia
their
delegates
baldwin
the
pinckneys
rutledge
and
others
asserted
flatly
not
less
than
a
times
during
the
debate
that
these
states
can
never
receive
the
plan
if
it
prohibits
the
that
if
the
convention
thought
that
these
states
would
consent
to
a
stoppage
of
the
the
expectation
is
vain
by
this
stand
all
argument
from
the
moral
standpoint
was
virtually
silenced
for
the
convention
evidently
agreed
with
roger
sherman
of
connecticut
that
it
was
better
to
let
the
southern
states
import
slaves
than
to
part
with
those
states
in
such
a
dilemma
the
convention
listened
not
unwillingly
to
the
arguments
of
the
states
rights
advocates
the
morality
and
wisdom
of
slavery
declared
ellsworth
of
connecticut
are
considerations
belonging
to
the
states
themselves
let
every
state
import
what
it
pleases
the
confederation
has
not
meddled
with
the
question
why
should
the
union
it
is
a
dangerous
symptom
of
centralization
cried
baldwin
of
georgia
the
central
states
wish
to
be
the
vortex
for
everything
even
matters
of
a
local
nature
the
national
government
said
gerry
of
massachusetts
had
nothing
to
do
with
slavery
in
the
states
it
had
only
to
refrain
from
giving
direct
sanction
to
the
system
others
opposed
this
whole
argument
declaring
with
langdon
of
new
hampshire
that
congress
ought
to
have
this
power
since
as
dickinson
tartly
remarked
the
true
question
was
whether
the
national
happiness
would
be
promoted
or
impeded
by
the
importation
and
this
question
ought
to
be
left
to
the
national
government
not
to
the
states
particularly
interested
beside
these
arguments
as
to
the
right
of
the
trade
and
the
proper
seat
of
authority
over
it
many
arguments
of
general
expediency
were
introduced
from
an
economic
standpoint
for
instance
general
pinckney
of
south
carolina
contended
that
the
importation
of
slaves
would
be
for
the
interest
of
the
whole
union
the
more
slaves
the
more
produce
rutledge
of
the
same
state
declared
if
the
northern
states
consult
their
interest
they
will
not
oppose
the
increase
of
slaves
which
will
increase
the
commodities
of
which
they
will
become
the
carriers
this
sentiment
found
a
more
or
less
conscious
echo
in
the
words
of
ellsworth
of
connecticut
what
enriches
a
part
enriches
the
whole
it
was
moreover
broadly
hinted
that
the
zeal
of
maryland
and
virginia
against
the
trade
had
an
economic
rather
than
a
humanitarian
motive
since
they
had
slaves
enough
and
to
spare
and
wished
to
sell
them
at
a
high
price
to
south
carolina
and
georgia
who
needed
more
in
such
case
restrictions
would
unjustly
discriminate
against
the
latter
states
the
argument
from
history
was
barely
touched
upon
only
once
was
there
an
allusion
to
the
example
of
all
the
world
in
all
ages
to
justify
slavery
and
once
came
the
counter
declaration
that
greece
and
rome
were
made
unhappy
by
their
slaves
on
the
other
hand
the
military
weakness
of
slavery
in
the
late
war
led
to
many
arguments
on
that
score
luther
martin
and
george
mason
dwelt
on
the
danger
of
a
servile
class
in
war
and
insurrection
while
rutledge
hotly
replied
that
he
would
readily
exempt
the
other
states
from
the
obligation
to
protect
the
southern
against
them
and
ellsworth
thought
that
the
very
danger
would
become
a
motive
to
kind
treatment
the
desirability
of
keeping
slavery
out
of
the
west
was
once
mentioned
as
an
argument
against
the
trade
to
this
all
seemed
tacitly
to
agree
throughout
the
debate
it
is
manifest
that
the
convention
had
no
desire
really
to
enter
upon
a
general
slavery
argument
the
broader
and
more
theoretic
aspects
of
the
question
were
but
lightly
touched
upon
here
and
there
undoubtedly
most
of
the
members
would
have
much
preferred
not
to
raise
the
question
at
all
but
as
it
was
raised
the
differences
of
opinion
were
too
manifest
to
be
ignored
and
the
convention
after
its
first
perplexity
gradually
and
perhaps
too
willingly
set
itself
to
work
to
find
some
middle
ground
on
which
all
parties
could
stand
the
way
to
this
compromise
was
pointed
out
by
the
south
the
most
radical
arguments
always
ended
with
the
opinion
that
if
the
southern
states
were
let
alone
they
will
probably
of
themselves
stop
importations
to
be
sure
general
pinckney
admitted
that
candidly
he
did
not
think
south
carolina
would
stop
her
importations
of
slaves
in
any
short
time
nevertheless
the
convention
observed
with
roger
sherman
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
seemed
to
be
going
on
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
good
sense
of
the
several
states
would
probably
by
degrees
complete
it
economic
forces
were
evoked
to
eke
out
moral
motives
when
the
south
had
its
full
quota
of
slaves
like
virginia
it
too
would
abolish
the
trade
free
labor
was
bound
finally
to
drive
out
slave
labor
thus
the
chorus
of
increased
and
compromise
seemed
at
least
in
sight
when
connecticut
cried
let
the
trade
alone
and
georgia
denounced
it
as
an
evil
some
few
discordant
notes
were
heard
as
for
instance
when
wilson
of
pennsylvania
made
the
uncomforting
remark
if
south
carolina
and
georgia
were
themselves
disposed
to
get
rid
of
the
importation
of
slaves
in
a
short
time
as
had
been
suggested
they
would
never
refuse
to
unite
because
the
importation
might
be
prohibited
with
the
spirit
of
compromise
in
the
air
it
was
not
long
before
the
general
terms
were
clear
the
slavery
side
was
strongly
intrenched
and
had
a
clear
and
definite
demand
the
forces
of
freedom
were
on
the
contrary
divided
by
important
conflicts
of
interest
and
animated
by
no
very
strong
and
decided
spirit
with
settled
aims
under
such
circumstances
it
was
easy
for
the
convention
to
miss
the
opportunity
for
a
really
great
compromise
and
to
descend
to
a
scheme
that
savored
unpleasantly
of
the
student
of
the
situation
will
always
have
good
cause
to
believe
that
a
more
sturdy
and
definite
stand
at
this
point
might
have
changed
history
for
the
better
special
committee
and
the
bargain
since
the
debate
had
in
the
first
place
arisen
from
a
proposition
to
tax
the
importation
of
slaves
the
yielding
of
this
point
by
the
south
was
the
first
move
toward
compromise
to
all
but
the
doctrinaires
who
shrank
from
taxing
men
as
property
the
argument
that
the
failure
to
tax
slaves
was
equivalent
to
a
bounty
was
conclusive
with
this
point
settled
randolph
voiced
the
general
sentiment
when
he
declared
that
he
was
for
committing
in
order
that
some
middle
ground
might
if
possible
be
found
finally
gouverneur
morris
discovered
the
middle
ground
in
his
suggestion
that
the
whole
subject
be
committed
including
the
clauses
relating
to
taxes
on
exports
and
to
a
navigation
act
these
things
said
he
may
form
a
bargain
among
the
northern
and
southern
states
this
was
quickly
assented
to
and
sections
four
and
five
on
and
capitation
tax
were
committed
by
a
vote
of
to
and
section
six
on
navigation
acts
by
a
vote
of
to
all
three
clauses
were
referred
to
the
following
committee
langdon
of
new
hampshire
king
of
massachusetts
johnson
of
connecticut
livingston
of
new
jersey
clymer
of
pennsylvania
dickinson
of
delaware
martin
of
maryland
madison
of
virginia
williamson
of
north
carolina
general
pinckney
of
south
carolina
and
baldwin
of
georgia
the
fullest
account
of
the
proceedings
of
this
committee
is
given
in
luther
martin
letter
to
his
constituents
and
is
confirmed
in
its
main
particulars
by
similar
reports
of
other
delegates
martin
writes
a
committee
of
member
from
each
state
was
chosen
by
ballot
to
take
this
part
of
the
system
under
their
consideration
and
to
endeavor
to
agree
upon
some
report
which
should
reconcile
those
states
south
carolina
and
georgia
to
this
committee
also
was
referred
the
following
proposition
which
had
been
reported
by
the
committee
of
detail
viz
navigation
act
shall
be
passed
without
the
assent
of
two
thirds
of
the
members
present
in
each
house
a
proposition
which
the
staple
and
commercial
states
were
solicitous
to
retain
lest
their
commerce
should
be
placed
too
much
under
the
power
of
the
eastern
states
but
which
these
last
states
were
as
anxious
to
reject
this
committee
of
which
also
i
had
the
honor
to
be
a
member
met
and
took
under
their
consideration
the
subjects
committed
to
them
i
found
the
states
notwithstanding
their
to
were
very
willing
to
indulge
the
southern
states
at
least
with
a
temporary
liberty
to
prosecute
the
slave
trade
provided
the
southern
states
would
in
their
turn
gratify
by
laying
no
restriction
on
navigation
acts
and
after
a
very
little
time
the
committee
by
a
great
majority
agreed
on
a
report
by
which
the
general
government
was
to
be
prohibited
from
preventing
the
importation
of
slaves
for
a
limited
time
and
the
restrictive
clause
relative
to
navigation
acts
was
to
be
omitted
that
the
bargain
was
soon
made
is
proven
by
the
fact
that
the
committee
reported
the
very
next
day
friday
august
and
that
on
saturday
the
report
was
taken
up
it
was
as
follows
strike
out
so
much
of
the
fourth
section
as
was
referred
to
the
committee
and
insert
migration
or
importation
of
such
persons
as
the
several
states
now
existing
shall
think
proper
to
admit
shall
not
be
prohibited
by
the
legislature
prior
to
the
year
but
a
tax
or
duty
may
be
imposed
on
such
migration
or
importation
at
a
rate
not
exceeding
the
average
of
the
duties
laid
on
imports
the
fifth
section
to
remain
as
in
the
report
the
sixth
section
to
be
stricken
out
appeal
to
the
the
ensuing
debate
which
lasted
only
a
part
of
the
day
was
evidently
a
sort
of
appeal
to
the
house
on
the
decisions
of
the
committee
it
throws
light
on
the
points
of
disagreement
general
pinckney
first
proposed
to
extend
the
limit
to
and
gorham
of
massachusetts
seconded
the
motion
this
brought
a
spirited
protest
from
madison
twenty
years
will
produce
all
the
mischief
that
can
be
apprehended
from
the
liberty
to
import
slaves
so
long
a
term
will
be
more
dishonorable
to
the
american
character
than
to
say
nothing
about
it
in
the
constitution
there
was
however
evidently
another
bargain
here
for
without
farther
debate
the
south
and
the
east
voted
the
extension
to
only
new
jersey
pennsylvania
delaware
and
virginia
objecting
the
ambiguous
phraseology
of
the
whole
section
as
reported
did
not
pass
without
comment
gouverneur
morris
would
have
it
read
the
importation
of
slaves
into
north
carolina
south
carolina
and
georgia
shall
not
be
prohibited
etc
this
emendation
was
however
too
painfully
truthful
for
the
doctrinaires
and
was
amid
a
score
of
objections
withdrawn
the
taxation
clause
also
was
manifestly
too
vague
for
practical
use
and
baldwin
of
georgia
wished
to
amend
it
by
inserting
common
impost
on
articles
not
enumerated
in
lieu
of
the
average
duty
this
minor
point
gave
rise
to
considerable
argument
sherman
and
madison
deprecated
any
such
recognition
of
property
in
man
as
taxing
would
imply
mason
and
gorham
argued
that
the
tax
restrained
the
trade
while
king
langdon
and
general
pinckney
contented
themselves
with
the
remark
that
this
clause
was
the
price
of
the
first
part
finally
it
was
unanimously
agreed
to
make
the
duty
not
exceeding
ten
dollars
for
each
person
southern
interests
now
being
safe
some
southern
members
attempted
a
few
days
later
to
annul
the
bargain
by
restoring
the
requirement
of
a
vote
in
navigation
acts
charles
pinckney
made
the
motion
in
an
elaborate
speech
designed
to
show
the
conflicting
commercial
interests
of
the
states
he
declared
that
the
power
of
regulating
commerce
was
a
pure
concession
on
the
part
of
the
southern
states
martin
and
williamson
of
north
carolina
butler
of
south
carolina
and
mason
of
virginia
defended
the
proposition
insisting
that
it
would
be
a
dangerous
concession
on
the
part
of
the
south
to
leave
navigation
acts
to
a
mere
majority
vote
sherman
of
connecticut
morris
of
pennsylvania
and
spaight
of
north
carolina
declared
that
the
very
diversity
of
interest
was
a
security
finally
by
a
vote
of
to
maryland
virginia
north
carolina
and
georgia
being
in
the
minority
the
convention
refused
to
consider
the
motion
and
the
recommendation
of
the
committee
passed
when
on
september
the
convention
was
discussing
the
amendment
clause
of
the
constitution
the
rutledge
perceiving
that
the
results
of
the
laboriously
settled
bargain
might
be
endangered
declared
that
he
never
could
agree
to
give
a
power
by
which
the
articles
relating
to
slaves
might
be
altered
by
the
states
not
interested
in
that
property
as
a
result
the
clause
finally
adopted
september
had
the
proviso
provided
that
no
amendment
which
may
be
made
prior
to
the
year
shall
in
any
manner
affect
the
and
clauses
in
the
section
of
the
article
by
the
thus
the
article
of
the
constitution
stood
finally
as
follows
article
i
section
the
migration
or
importation
of
such
persons
as
any
of
the
states
now
existing
shall
think
proper
to
admit
shall
not
be
prohibited
by
the
congress
prior
to
the
year
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
eight
but
a
tax
or
duty
may
be
imposed
on
such
importation
not
exceeding
ten
dollars
for
each
person
this
settlement
of
the
slavery
question
brought
out
distinct
differences
of
moral
attitude
toward
the
institution
and
yet
differences
far
from
hopeless
to
be
sure
the
south
apologized
for
slavery
the
middle
states
denounced
it
and
the
east
could
only
tolerate
it
from
afar
and
yet
all
three
sections
united
in
considering
it
a
temporary
institution
the
of
which
was
the
no
one
of
them
had
ever
seen
a
system
of
slavery
without
an
active
and
there
were
probably
few
members
of
the
convention
who
did
not
believe
that
the
foundations
of
slavery
had
been
sapped
merely
by
putting
the
abolition
of
the
in
the
hands
of
congress
twenty
years
hence
here
lay
the
danger
for
when
the
north
called
slavery
temporary
she
thought
of
twenty
or
thirty
years
while
the
temporary
period
of
the
south
was
scarcely
less
than
a
century
meantime
for
at
least
a
score
of
years
a
policy
of
strict
so
far
as
the
general
government
was
concerned
was
to
intervene
instead
of
calling
the
whole
moral
energy
of
the
people
into
action
so
as
gradually
to
crush
this
portentous
evil
the
federal
convention
lulled
the
nation
to
sleep
by
a
bargain
and
left
to
the
vacillating
and
unripe
judgment
of
the
states
one
of
the
most
threatening
of
the
social
and
political
ills
which
they
were
so
courageously
seeking
to
remedy
of
the
clause
by
the
when
the
proposed
constitution
was
before
the
country
the
article
came
in
for
no
small
amount
of
condemnation
and
apology
in
the
pamphlets
of
the
day
it
was
much
discussed
one
of
the
points
in
mason
letter
of
objections
was
that
the
general
legislature
is
restrained
from
prohibiting
the
further
importation
of
slaves
for
twenty
odd

such
importations
render
the

weaker

all
the
states

to
adopt
this
regulation

prohibit
the
i
should
as
an
individual
most
heartily
have
approved
of
it
because
even
if
the
importation
of
slaves
in
fact
rendered
us
stronger
less
vulnerable
and
more
capable
of
defence
i
should
rejoice
in
the
prohibition
of
it
as
putting
an
end
to
a
trade
which
has
already
continued
too
long
for
the
honor
and
humanity
of
those
concerned
in
it
but
as
it
was
well
known
that
south
carolina
and
georgia
thought
a
further
continuance
of
such
importations
useful
to
them
and
would
not
perhaps
otherwise
have
agreed
to
the
new
constitution
those
states
which
had
been
importing
till
they
were
satisfied
could
not
with
decency
have
insisted
upon
their
relinquishing
advantages
themselves
had
already
enjoyed
our
situation

it
necessary
to
bear
the
evil
as
it
is
it
will
be
left
to
the
future
legislatures
to
allow
such
importations
or
not
if
any
in
violation
of
their
clear
conviction
of
the
injustice
of
this
trade
persist
in
pursuing
it
this
is
a
matter
between
god
and
their
own
consciences
the
interests
of
humanity
will
however
have
gained
something
by
the
prohibition
of
this
inhuman
trade
though
at
a
distance
of
twenty
odd
years
centinel
representing
the
quaker
sentiment
of
pennsylvania
attacked
the
clause
in
his
third
letter
published
in
the
gazetteer
or
the
chronicle
of
november
we
are
told
that
the
objects
of
this
article
are
slaves
and
that
it
is
inserted
to
secure
to
the
southern
states
the
right
of
introducing
negroes
for
years
to
come
against
the
declared
sense
of
the
other
states
to
put
an
end
to
an
odious
traffic
in
the
human
species
which
is
especially
scandalous
and
inconsistent
in
a
people
who
have
asserted
their
own
liberty
by
the
sword
and
which
dangerously
enfeebles
the
districts
wherein
the
laborers
are
bondsmen
the
words
dark
and
ambiguous
such
as
no
plain
man
of
common
sense
would
have
used
are
evidently
chosen
to
conceal
from
europe
that
in
this
enlightened
country
the
practice
of
slavery
has
its
advocates
among
men
in
the
highest
stations
when
it
is
recollected
that
no
poll
tax
can
be
imposed
on
negroes
above
what
whites
shall
be
charged
when
it
is
considered
that
the
imposts
on
the
consumption
of
carolina
field
negroes
must
be
trifling
and
the
excise
nothing
it
is
plain
that
the
proportion
of
contributions
which
can
be
expected
from
the
southern
states
under
the
new
constitution
will
be
unequal
and
yet
they
are
to
be
allowed
to
enfeeble
themselves
by
the
further
importation
of
negroes
till
the
year
has
not
the
concurrence
of
the
five
southern
states
in
the
convention
to
the
new
system
been
purchased
too
dearly
by
the
rest
noah
webster
examination
addressed
itself
to
such
quaker
scruples
but
say
the
enemies
of
slavery
negroes
may
be
imported
for
years
this
exception
is
addressed
to
the
quakers
and
a
very
pitiful
exception
it
is
the
truth
is
congress
can
not
prohibit
the
importation
of
slaves
during
that
period
but
the
laws
against
the
importation
into
particular
states
stand
unrepealed
an
immediate
abolition
of
slavery
would
bring
ruin
upon
the
whites
and
misery
upon
the
blacks
in
the
southern
states
the
constitution
has
therefore
wisely
left
each
state
to
pursue
its
own
measures
with
respect
to
this
article
of
legislation
during
the
period
of
years
the
following
year
the
examination
of
tench
coxe
said
the
temporary
reservation
of
any
particular
matter
must
ever
be
deemed
an
admission
that
it
should
be
done
away
this
appears
to
have
been
well
understood
in
addition
to
the
arguments
drawn
from
liberty
justice
and
religion
opinions
against
this
practice
of
founded
in
sound
policy
have
no
doubt
been
urged
regard
was
necessarily
paid
to
the
peculiar
situation
of
our
southern
but
they
on
the
other
hand
have
not
been
insensible
of
the
delicate
situation
of
our
national
character
on
this
subject
from
quite
different
motives
southern
men
defended
this
section
for
instance
david
ramsay
a
south
carolina
member
of
the
convention
wrote
in
his
address
it
is
farther
objected
that
they
have
stipulated
for
a
right
to
prohibit
the
importation
of
negroes
after
years
on
this
subject
observe
as
they
are
bound
to
protect
us
from
domestic
violence
they
think
we
ought
not
to
increase
our
exposure
to
that
evil
by
an
unlimited
importation
of
slaves
though
congress
may
forbid
the
importation
of
negroes
after
years
it
does
not
follow
that
they
will
on
the
other
hand
it
is
probable
that
they
will
not
the
more
rice
we
make
the
more
business
will
be
for
their
shipping
their
interest
will
therefore
coincide
with
ours
besides
we
have
other
sources
of
supply
the
importation
of
the
ensuing
years
added
to
the
natural
increase
of
those
we
already
have
and
the
influx
from
our
northern
neighbours
who
are
desirous
of
getting
rid
of
their
slaves
will
afford
a
sufficient
number
for
cultivating
all
the
lands
in
this
state
finally
no
written
by
james
madison
commented
as
follows
it
were
doubtless
to
be
wished
that
the
power
of
prohibiting
the
importation
of
slaves
had
not
been
postponed
until
the
year
or
rather
that
it
had
been
suffered
to
have
immediate
operation
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
account
either
for
this
restriction
on
the
general
government
or
for
the
manner
in
which
the
whole
clause
is
expressed
it
ought
to
be
considered
as
a
great
point
gained
in
favor
of
humanity
that
a
period
of
twenty
years
may
terminate
forever
within
these
states
a
traffic
which
has
so
long
and
so
loudly
upbraided
the
barbarism
of
modern
policy
that
within
that
period
it
will
receive
a
considerable
discouragement
from
the
federal
government
and
may
be
totally
abolished
by
a
concurrence
of
the
few
states
which
continue
the
unnatural
traffic
in
the
prohibitory
example
which
has
been
given
by
so
great
a
majority
of
the
union
happy
would
it
be
for
the
unfortunate
africans
if
an
equal
prospect
lay
before
them
of
being
redeemed
from
the
oppressions
of
their
european
brethren
attempts
have
been
made
to
pervert
this
clause
into
an
objection
against
the
constitution
by
representing
it
on
one
side
as
a
criminal
toleration
of
an
illicit
practice
and
on
another
as
calculated
to
prevent
voluntary
and
beneficial
emigrations
from
europe
to
america
i
mention
these
misconstructions
not
with
a
view
to
give
them
an
answer
for
they
deserve
none
but
as
specimens
of
the
manner
and
spirit
in
which
some
have
thought
fit
to
conduct
their
opposition
to
the
proposed
government
of
the
state
the
records
of
the
proceedings
in
the
various
state
conventions
are
exceedingly
meagre
in
nearly
all
of
the
few
states
where
records
exist
there
is
found
some
opposition
to
the
clause
the
opposition
was
seldom
very
pronounced
or
bitter
it
rather
took
the
form
of
regret
on
the
one
hand
that
the
convention
went
so
far
and
on
the
other
hand
that
it
did
not
go
farther
probably
however
the
constitution
was
never
in
danger
of
rejection
on
account
of
this
clause
extracts
from
a
few
of
the
speeches
and
in
various
states
will
best
illustrate
the
character
of
the
arguments
in
reply
to
some
objections
expressed
in
the
pennsylvania
convention
wilson
said
december
i
consider
this
as
laying
the
foundation
for
banishing
slavery
out
of
this
country
and
though
the
period
is
more
distant
than
i
could
wish
yet
it
will
produce
the
same
kind
gradual
change
which
was
pursued
in
pennsylvania
robert
barnwell
declared
in
the
south
carolina
convention
january
that
this
clause
particularly
pleased
him
congress
he
said
has
guarantied
this
right
for
that
space
of
time
and
at
its
expiration
may
continue
it
as
long
as
they
please
this
question
then
arises
what
will
their
interest
lead
them
to
do
the
eastern
states
as
the
honorable
gentleman
says
will
become
the
carriers
of
america
it
will
therefore
certainly
be
their
interest
to
encourage
exportation
to
as
great
an
extent
as
possible
and
if
the
quantum
of
our
products
will
be
diminished
by
the
prohibition
of
negroes
i
appeal
to
the
belief
of
every
man
whether
he
thinks
those
very
carriers
will
themselves
dam
up
the
sources
from
whence
their
profit
is
derived
to
think
so
is
so
contradictory
to
the
general
conduct
of
mankind
that
i
am
of
opinion
that
without
we
ourselves
put
a
stop
to
them
the
traffic
for
negroes
will
continue
forever
in
massachusetts
january
general
heath
said
the
gentlemen
who
have
spoken
have
carried
the
matter
rather
too
far
on
both
sides
i
apprehend
that
it
is
not
in
our
power
to
do
anything
for
or
against
those
who
are
in
slavery
in
the
southern
states
two
questions
naturally
arise
if
we
ratify
the
constitution
shall
we
do
anything
by
our
act
to
hold
the
blacks
in
slavery
or
shall
we
become
partakers
of
other
men
sins
i
think
neither
of
them
each
state
is
sovereign
and
independent
to
a
certain
degree
and
they
have
a
right
and
will
regulate
their
own
internal
affairs
as
to
themselves
appears
proper
iredell
said
in
the
north
carolina
convention
july
when
the
entire
abolition
of
slavery
takes
place
it
will
be
an
event
which
must
be
pleasing
to
every
generous
mind
and
every
friend
of
human
nature
but
as
it
is
this
government
is
nobly
distinguished
above
others
by
that
very
provision
of
the
arguments
against
the
clause
two
made
in
the
massachusetts
convention
are
typical
the
rev
neal
said
january
that
unless
his
objection
to
this
clause
was
removed
he
could
not
put
his
hand
to
the
constitution
general
thompson
exclaimed
shall
it
be
said
that
after
we
have
established
our
own
independence
and
freedom
we
make
slaves
of
others
mason
in
the
virginia
convention
june
said
as
much
as
i
value
a
union
of
all
the
states
i
would
not
admit
the
southern
states
into
the
union
unless
they
agree
to
the
discontinuance
of
this
disgraceful
trade
yet
they
have
not
secured
us
the
property
of
the
slaves
we
have
already
so
that
have
done
what
they
ought
not
to
have
done
and
have
left
undone
what
they
ought
to
have
done
joshua
atherton
who
led
the
opposition
in
the
new
hampshire
convention
said
the
idea
that
strikes
those
who
are
opposed
to
this
clause
so
disagreeably
and
so
forcibly
is
hereby
it
is
conceived
if
we
ratify
the
constitution
that
we
become
and
the
sin
and
guilt
of
this
abominable
traffic
at
least
for
a
certain
period
without
any
positive
stipulation
that
it
shall
even
then
be
brought
to
an
end
in
the
south
carolina
convention
lowndes
january
attacked
the
clause
negroes
said
he
were
our
wealth
our
only
natural
resource
yet
behold
how
our
kind
friends
in
the
north
were
determined
soon
to
tie
up
our
hands
and
drain
us
of
what
we
had
the
eastern
states
drew
their
means
of
subsistence
in
a
great
measure
from
their
shipping
and
on
that
head
they
had
been
particularly
careful
not
to
allow
of
any
burdens
why
then
call
this
a
reciprocal
bargain
which
took
all
from
one
party
to
bestow
it
on
the
other
in
spite
of
this
discussion
in
the
different
states
only
one
state
rhode
island
went
so
far
as
to
propose
an
amendment
directing
congress
to
promote
and
establish
such
laws
and
regulations
as
may
effectually
prevent
the
importation
of
slaves
of
every
description
into
the
united
states
of
the
as
in
the
federal
convention
so
in
the
state
conventions
it
is
noticeable
that
the
compromise
was
accepted
by
the
various
states
from
widely
different
motives
nevertheless
these
motives
were
not
fixed
and
unchangeable
and
there
was
still
discernible
a
certain
underlying
agreement
in
the
dislike
of
slavery
one
can
not
help
thinking
that
if
the
devastation
of
the
late
war
had
not
left
an
extraordinary
demand
for
slaves
in
the
south
if
for
instance
there
had
been
in
the
same
plethora
in
the
as
in
the
future
history

country
would
have
been
far
different
as
it
was

years
of
were
confirmed

the

argument
a
wave
of
horror
and
fear
swept
over
the
south
which
even
the
powerful
of
georgia
did
not
dare
withstand
the
middle
states
saw
their
worst
dreams
realized
and
the
mercenary
trade
interests
of
the
east
lost
control
of
the
new

conscience
of
the
southern

a
few
years
the
growing
sentiment
had
crystallized
into
legislation
the
southern

took
immediate
measures
to
close
their
ports

against

finally
against
all
slaves
georgia
who
had
had
legal
slavery
only
from
and
had
since
passed
no
restrictive
legislation
felt
compelled
in
to
stop
the
entry
of
free
negroes
and
in
to
prohibit
under
heavy
penalties
the
importation
of
all
slaves
this
provision
was
placed
in
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
although
miserably
enforced
was
never
repealed
south
carolina
was
the
first
southern
state
in
which
the
exigencies
of
a
great
staple
crop
rendered
the
rapid
consumption
of
slaves
more
profitable
than
their
proper
maintenance
alternating
therefore
between
a
plethora
and
a
dearth
of
negroes
she
prohibited
the
only
for
short
periods
in
she
had
forbidden
the
trade
for
five
years
and
in
being
peculiarly
exposed
to
the
west
indian
insurrection
she
quickly
found
it
inexpedient
to
allow
negroes
from
africa
the
west
india
islands
or
other
place
beyond
sea
to
enter
for
two
years
this
act
continued
to
be
extended
although
with
lessening
penalties
until
the
home
demand
in
view
of
the
probable
stoppage
of
the
trade
in
the
speculative
chances
of
the
new

trade
and
the
large
already
existing
illicit
traffic
combined
in
that
year
to
cause
the
passage
of
an
act
december
reopening
the
african
although
still
carefully
excluding
west
india
negroes
this
action
profoundly
stirred
the
union
aroused
sentiment
led
to
a
concerted
movement
for
a
constitutional
amendment
and
failing
in
this
to
an
irresistible
demand
for
a
national
prohibitory
act
at
the
earliest
constitutional
moment
north
carolina
had
repealed
her
prohibitory
duty
act
in
but
in
she
passed
an
act
to
prevent
further
importation
and
bringing
of
slaves
etc
even
the
of
west
india
immigrants
and
naturally
all
free
negroes
were
eventually
prohibited
of
the
border
the
border
states
virginia
and
maryland
strengthened
their
laws
virginia
freeing
illegally
imported
negroes
and
maryland
prohibiting
even
the
interstate
trade
the
middle
states
took
action
chiefly
in
the
final
abolition
of
slavery
within
their
borders
and
the
prevention
of
the
fitting
out
of
slaving
vessels
in
their
ports
delaware
declared
in
her
act
of
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
that
spirit
of
general
liberty
which
pervades
the
constitution
of
this
state
that
vessels
should
be
fitted
out
or
equipped
in
any
of
the
ports
thereof
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
and
transporting
the
natives
of
africa
to
places
where
they
are
held
in
slavery
and
forbade
such
a
practice
under
penalty
of
for
each
person
so
engaged
the
pennsylvania
act
of
had
similar
provisions
with
a
penalty
of
and
new

followed
with
an
act
in
of
the
eastern
in
the
eastern
states
where
slavery
as
an
institution
was
already
nearly
defunct
action
was
aimed
toward
stopping
the
notorious
participation
of
citizens
in
the
outside
the
state
the
prime
movers
were
the
rhode
island
quakers
having
early
secured
a
law
against
the
traffic
in
their
own
state
they
turned
their
attention
to
others
through
their
remonstrances
connecticut
in
prohibited
participation
in
the
trade
by
a
fine
of
on
the
vessel
on
each
slave
and
loss
of
insurance
this
act
was
strengthened
in
the
year
after
the
haytian
revolt
massachusetts
after
many
fruitless
attempts
finally
took
advantage
of
an
unusually
bold
case
of
kidnapping
and
passed
a
similar
act
in
this
says
belknap
was
the
utmost
which
could
be
done
by
our
legislatures
we
still
have
to
regret
the
impossibility
of
making
a
law
which
shall
restrain
our
citizens
from
carrying
on
this
trade
foreign
and
from
committing
the
crimes
which
this
act
prohibits
foreign
as
it
is
said
some
of
them
have
done
since
the
enacting
of
these
laws
thus
it
is
seen
how
spurred
by
the
tragedy
in
the
west
indies
the
united
states
succeeded
by
state
action
in
prohibiting
the
from
to
in
furthering
the
cause
of
abolition
and
in
preventing
the
fitting
out
of
expeditions
in
united
states
ports
the
country
had
good
cause
to
congratulate
itself
the
national
government
hastened
to
supplement
state
action
as
far
as
possible
and
the
prophecies
of
the
more
sanguine
revolutionary
fathers
seemed
about
to
be
realized
when
the
act
of
south
carolina
showed
the
weakness
of
the
constitutional
compromise
debate
in
congress
the
attention
of
the
national
government
was
early
directed
to
slavery
and
the
trade
by
the
rise
in
the
first
congress
of
the
question
of
taxing
slaves
imported
during
the
debate
on
the
duty
bill
introduced
by
clymer
committee
parker
of
virginia
moved
may
to
lay
a
tax
of
ten
dollars
on
slaves
imported
he
plainly
stated
that
the
tax
was
designed
to
check
the
trade
and
that
he
was
sorry
that
the
constitution
prevented
congress
from
prohibiting
the
importation
altogether
the
proposal
was
evidently
unwelcome
and
caused
an
extended
debate
smith
of
south
carolina
wanted
to
postpone
a
matter
so
big
with
the
most
serious
consequences
to
the
state
he
represented
roger
sherman
of
connecticut
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
the
insertion
of
human
beings
as
an
article
of
duty
among
goods
wares
and
merchandise
jackson
of
georgia
argued
against
any
restriction
and
thought
such
states
as
virginia
ought
to
let
their
neighbors
get
supplied
before
they
imposed
such
a
burden
upon
the
importation
tucker
of
south
carolina
declared
it
unfair
to
bring
in
such
an
important
subject
at
a
time
when
debate
was
almost
precluded
and
denied
the
right
of
congress
to
consider
whether
the
importation
of
slaves
is
proper
or
not
parker
was
evidently
somewhat
abashed
by
this
onslaught
of
friend
and
foe
but
he
had
ventured
to
introduce
the
subject
after
full
deliberation
and
did
not
like
to
withdraw
it
he
desired
congress
if
possible
to
wipe
off
the
stigma
under
which
america
labored
this
brought
jackson
of
georgia
again
to
his
feet
he
believed
in
spite
of
the
fashion
of
the
day
that
the
negroes
were
better
off
as
slaves
than
as
freedmen
and
that
as
the
tax
was
partial
it
would
be
the
most
odious
tax
congress
could
impose
such
sentiments
were
a
distinct
advance
in
doctrine
and
called
for
a
protest
from
madison
of
virginia
he
thought
the
discussion
proper
denied
the
partiality
of
the
tax
and
declared
that
according
to
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
and
his
own
desire
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
by
expressing
a
national
disapprobation
of
this
trade
we
may
destroy
it
and
save
ourselves
from
reproaches
and
our
posterity
the
imbecility
ever
attendant
on
a
country
filled
with
slaves
finally
to
burke
of
south
carolina
who
thought
the
gentlemen
were
contending
for
nothing
madison
sharply
rejoined
if
we
contend
for
nothing
the
gentlemen
who
are
opposed
to
us
do
not
contend
for
a
great
deal
it
now
became
clear
that
congress
had
been
whirled
into
a
discussion
of
too
delicate
and
lengthy
a
nature
to
allow
its
further
prolongation
compromising
councils
prevailed
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
present
proposition
should
be
withdrawn
and
a
separate
bill
brought
in
this
bill
was
however
at
the
next
session
dexterously
postponed
until
the
next
session
of
congress
debate
in
congress
it
is
doubtful
if
congress
of
its
own
initiative
would
soon
have
resurrected
the
matter
had
not
a
new
weapon
appeared
in
the
shape
of
urgent
petitions
from
abolition
societies
the
first
petition
presented
february
was
from
the
same
interstate
yearly
meeting
of
friends
which
had
formerly
petitioned
the
confederation
congress
they
urged
congress
to
inquire
whether
notwithstanding
such
seeming
impediments
it
be
not
in
reality
within
your
power
to
exercise
justice
and
mercy
which
if
adhered
to
we
can
not
doubt
must
produce
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
etc
another
quaker
petition
from
new
york
was
also
presented
and
both
were
about
to
be
referred
when
smith
of
south
carolina
objected
and
precipitated
a
sharp
debate
this
debate
had
a
distinctly
different
tone
from
that
of
the
preceding
one
and
represents
another
step
in
doctrine
the
of
these
utterances
was
struck
by
stone
of
maryland
who
feared
that
if
congress
took
any
measures
indicative
of
an
intention
to
interfere
with
the
kind
of
property
alluded
to
it
would
sink
it
in
value
very
considerably
and
might
be
injurious
to
a
great
number
of
the
citizens
particularly
in
the
southern
states
he
thought
the
subject
was
of
general
concern
and
that
the
petitioners
had
no
more
right
to
interfere
with
it
than
any
other
members
of
the
community
it
was
an
unfortunate
circumstance
that
it
was
the
disposition
of
religious
sects
to
imagine
they
understood
the
rights
of
human
nature
better
than
all
the
world
besides
in
vain
did
men
like
madison
disclaim
all
thought
of
unconstitutional
interference
and
express
only
a
desire
to
see
if
anything
is
within
the
federal
authority
to
restrain
such
violation
of
the
rights
of
nations
and
of
mankind
as
is
supposed
to
be
practised
in
some
parts
of
the
united
states
a
storm
of
disapproval
from
southern
members
met
such
sentiments
the
rights
of
the
southern
states
ought
not
to
be
threatened
said
burke
of
south
carolina
any
extraordinary
attention
of
congress
to
this
petition
averred
jackson
of
georgia
would
put
slave
property
in
jeopardy
and
evince
to
the
people
a
disposition
towards
a
total
emancipation
smith
and
tucker
of
south
carolina
declared
that
the
request
asked
for
unconstitutional
measures
gerry
of
massachusetts
hartley
of
pennsylvania
and
lawrence
of
new
york
rather
mildly
defended
the
petitioners
but
after
considerable
further
debate
the
matter
was
laid
on
the
table
the
very
next
day
however
the
laid
ghost
walked
again
in
the
shape
of
another
petition
from
the
pennsylvania
society
for
promoting
the
abolition
of
slavery
signed
by
its
venerable
president
benjamin
franklin
this
petition
asked
congress
to
step
to
the
very
verge
of
the
power
vested
in
you
for
discouraging
every
species
of
traffic
in
the
persons
of
our
hartley
of
pennsylvania
called
up
the
memorial
of
the
preceding
day
and
it
was
read
a
second
time
and
a
motion
for
commitment
made
plain
words
now
came
from
tucker
of
south
carolina
the
petition
he
said
contained
an
unconstitutional
request
the
commitment
would
alarm
the
south
these
petitions
were
mischievous
attempts
to
imbue
the
slaves
with
false
hopes
the
south
would
not
submit
to
a
general
emancipation
without
civil
war
the
commitment
would
blow
the
trumpet
of
sedition
in
the
southern
states
echoed
his
colleague
burke
the
pennsylvania
men
spoke
just
as
boldly
scott
declared
the
petition
constitutional
and
was
sorry
that
the
constitution
did
not
interdict
this
most
abominable
traffic
perhaps
in
our
legislative
capacity
he
said
we
can
go
no
further
than
to
impose
a
duty
of
ten
dollars
but
i
do
not
know
how
far
i
might
go
if
i
was
one
of
the
judges
of
the
united
states
and
those
people
were
to
come
before
me
and
claim
their
emancipation
but
i
am
sure
i
would
go
as
far
as
i
could
jackson
of
georgia
rejoined
in
true
southern
spirit
boldly
defending
slavery
in
the
light
of
religion
and
history
and
asking
if
it
was
good
policy
to
bring
forward
a
business
at
this
moment
likely
to
light
up
the
flame
of
civil
discord
for
the
people
of
the
southern
states
will
resist
one
tyranny
as
soon
as
another
the
other
parts
of
the
continent
may
bear
them
down
by
force
of
arms
but
they
will
never
suffer
themselves
to
be
divested
of
their
property
without
a
struggle
the
gentleman
says
if
he
was
a
federal
judge
he
does
not
know
to
what
length
he
would
go
in
emancipating
these
people
but
i
believe
his
judgment
would
be
of
short
duration
in
georgia
perhaps
even
the
existence
of
such
a
judge
might
be
in
danger
baldwin
his
colleague
urged
moderation
by
reciting
the
difficulty
with
which
the
constitutional
compromise
was
reached
and
declaring
the
moment
we
go
to
jostle
on
that
ground
i
fear
we
shall
feel
it
tremble
under
our
feet
lawrence
of
new
york
wanted
to
commit
the
memorials
in
order
to
see
how
far
congress
might
constitutionally
interfere
smith
of
south
carolina
in
a
long
speech
said
that
his
constituents
entered
the
union
from
political
not
from
moral
motives
and
that
we
look
upon
this
measure
as
an
attack
upon
the
palladium
of
the
property
of
our
country
page
of
virginia
although
a
slave
owner
urged
commitment
and
madison
again
maintained
the
appropriateness
of
the
request
and
suggested
that
regulations
might
be
made
in
relation
to
the
introduction
of
them
slaves
into
the
new
states
to
be
formed
out
of
the
western
territory
even
conservative
gerry
of
massachusetts
declared
with
regard
to
the
whole
trade
that
the
fact
that
we
have
a
right
to
regulate
this
business
is
as
clear
as
that
we
have
any
rights
whatever

the

to
make
this

a
sort
of
official

on
the

northern
politics
as
such
it
was
sure
to
meet
with
vehement
opposition
in

conservatively
worded
such
proved
to
be
the
fact
when

reported

the

prolonged

bitter
the

the
result

and
are
clearly
of
opinion
that

government
over
the
bore
early
fruit
in

second
congress
in
the
shape
of
a
shower
of
petitions
from
abolition
societies
in
massachusetts
rhode
island
connecticut
new
york
pennsylvania
maryland
and
virginia
in
some
of
these
slavery
was
denounced
as
an
outrageous
violation
of
one
of
the
most
essential
rights
of
human
nature
and
the
as
a
traffic
degrading
to
the
rights
of
man
and
repugnant
to
reason
others
declared
the
trade
injurious
to
the
true
commercial
interest
of
a
nation
and
asked
congress
that
having
taken
up
the
matter
they
do
all
in
their
power
to
limit
the
trade
congress
was
however
determined
to
avoid
as
long
as
possible
so
unpleasant
a
matter
and
save
an
angry
attempt
to
censure
a
quaker
petitioner
nothing
was
heard
of
the
until
the
third
congress
meantime
news
came
from
the
seas
southeast
of
carolina
and
georgia
which
influenced
congress
more
powerfully
than
humanitarian
arguments
had
done
the
wild
revolt
of
despised
slaves
the
rise
of
a
noble
black
leader
and
the
birth
of
a
new
nation
of
negro
freemen
frightened
the
advocates
and
armed
the
agitation
as
a
result
a
quaker
petition
for
a
law
against
the
transport
traffic
in
slaves
was
received
without
a
murmur
in
and
on
march
the
first
national
act
against

a

it
was
designed
to
prohibit
the
carrying
on
the
slave
trade
from
the
united

to
any
foreign
place
or
country
or
the
fitting
out
of

that
country
the
penalties
for
violation
were
forfeiture
of
the
ship
a
fine

for
each
person
engaged
and
of
for
each
slave
transported
if
the
quakers
thought
this
a
triumph
of
sentiment
they
were
quickly
undeceived
congress
might
willingly
restrain
the
country
from
feeding
west
indian
turbulence
and
yet
be
furious
at
a
petition
like
that
of
calling
attention
to
the
oppressed
state
of
our
brethren

the
african

that

the
evil
thereof

that
they
ought
to
shut
their
door
against
any
thing
which
had
a
tendency
to
produce
the
like
confusion
in
this
country
after

some
investigation

the
petition
of
certain
free
colored
men
of
pennsylvania
praying
for
a
revision
of
the
laws
and
of
the
law
and
for
prospective

waln
moved
the
reference
of
this
memorial
to
a
committee
already
appointed
on
the
revision
of
the
loosely
drawn
and
poorly
enforced
act
of
rutledge
of
south
carolina
immediately
arose
he
opposed
the
motion
saying
that
these
petitions
were
continually
coming
in
and
stirring
up
discord
that
it
was
a
good
thing
the
negroes
were
in
slavery
and
that
already
too
much
of
this
french
philosophy
of
liberty
and
equality
had
found
its
way
among
them
others
defended
the
right
of

declared
that

a

set
forth
the
commercial

of
his
state

said
he
we
want

we
ought
therefore
to
use

to

we
ought
to
go

called
the

back
from

discussion
to
the

while
willing
to
remedy
any
existing
defect
in
the
act
of
hoped
the
petition
would
not
be
received
dana
of
connecticut
declared
that
the
paper
contained
nothing
but
a
farrago
of
the
french
metaphysics
of
liberty
and
equality
and
that
it
was
likely
to
produce
some
of
the
dreadful
scenes
of
st
domingo
the
next
day
rutledge
again
warned
the
house
against
even
discussing
the
matter
as
very
serious
nay
dreadful
effects
must
be
the
inevitable
consequence
he
held
up
the
most
lurid
pictures
of
the
fatuity
of
the
french
convention
in
listening
to
the
overtures
of
the
three
emissaries
from
domingo
and
thus
yielding
one
of
the
finest
islands
in
the
world
to
scenes
which
had
never
been
practised
since
the
destruction
of
carthage
but
sir
he
continued
we
have
lived
to
see
these
dreadful
scenes
these
horrid
effects
have
succeeded
what
was
conceived
once
to
be
trifling
most
important
consequences
may
be
the
result
although
gentlemen
little
apprehend
it
but
we
know
the
situation
of
things
there
although
they
do
not
and
knowing
we
deprecate
it
there
have
been
emissaries
amongst
us
in
the
southern
states
they
have
begun
their
war
upon
us
an
actual
organization
has
commenced
we
have
had
them
meeting
in
their
club
rooms
and
debating
on
that
subject
sir
i
do
believe
that
persons
have
been
sent
from
france
to
feel
the
pulse
of
this
country
to
know
whether
these
the
negroes
are
the
proper
engines
to
make
use
of
these
people
have
been
talked
to
they
have
been
tampered
with
and
this
is
going
on
finally
after
censuring
certain
parts
of
this
negro
petition
congress
committed
the
part
on
the
to
the
committee
already
appointed
meantime
the
senate
sent
down
a
bill
to
amend
the
act
of

the
house
took
this
bill
under
consideration
prolonged
debate
ensued
brown
of
rhode
island
again
made
a
most
elaborate
plea
for
throwing
open
the
foreign
negroes
he
said
bettered
their
condition
by
being
enslaved
and
thus
it
was
morally
wrong
and
commercially
indefensible
to
impose
a
heavy
fine
and
imprisonment
for
carrying
on
a
trade
so
advantageous
or
if
the
trade
must
be
stopped
then
equalize
the
matter
and
abolish
slavery
too
nichols
of
virginia
thought
that
surely
the
gentlemen
would
not
advise
the
importation
of
more
negroes
for
while
it
was
a
fact
to
be
sure
that
they
would
thus
improve
their
condition
would
it
be
policy
so
to
do
bayard
of
delaware
said
that
a
more
dishonorable
item
of
revenue
than
that
derived
from
the
could
not
be
established
rutledge
opposed
the
new
bill
as
defective
and
impracticable
the
former
act
he
said
was
enough
the
states
had
stopped
the
trade
and
in
addition
the
united
states
had
sought
to
placate
philanthropists
by
stopping
the
use
of
our
ships
in
the
trade
this
was
going
very
far
indeed
new
england
first
began
the
trade
and
why
not
let
them
enjoy
its
profits
now
as
well
as
the
english
the
trade
could
not
be
stopped
the
bill
was
eventually
recommitted
and
reported
again
on
the
question
for
its
passing
a
long
and
warm
debate
ensued
and
several
attempts
to
postpone
it
were
made
it
finally
passed
however
only

against
it
and
voting
for
it
this
act
of
may
greatly
strengthened
the
act
of
the
earlier
act
had
prohibited
citizens
from
equipping
slavers
for
the
foreign
trade
but
this
went
so
far
as
to
forbid
them
having
any
interest
direct
or
indirect
in
such
voyages
or
serving
on
board
in
any
capacity
imprisonment
for
two
years
was
added
to
the
former
fine

commissioned

were
directed
to
capture
such
slavers
as
prizes
the
slaves
though
forfeited
by
the
owner
were
not
to
go
to
the
captor
and
the
act
omitted
to
say
what
disposition
should
be
made
of
them
act
of
the
haytian
revolt
having
been
among
the
main
causes
of

soon
was
the
direct
instigation
to
a
third
the
frightened
feeling
in
the
south
when
freedmen
from
the
west
indies
began
to
arrive
in
various
ports
may
well
be
imagined
on
january
the
town
of
wilmington
north
carolina
hastily
memorialized
congress
stating
the
arrival
of
certain
freed
negroes
from
guadeloupe
and
apprehending
much
danger
to
the
peace
and
safety
of
the
people
of
the
southern
states
of
the
union
from
the
admission
of
persons
of
that
description
into
the
united
states
the
house
committee
which
considered
this
petition
hastened
to
agree
that
the
system
of
policy
stated
in
the
said
memorial
to
exist
and
to
be
now
pursued
in
the
french
colonial
government
of
the
west
indies
is
fraught
with
danger
to
the
peace
and
safety
of
the
united
states
that
the
fact
stated
to
have
occurred
in
the
prosecution
of
that
system
of
policy
demands
the
prompt
interference
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
well
legislative
as
executive
the
result
was
a
bill
providing
for
the
forfeiture
of
any
ship
which
should
bring
into
states
prohibiting
the
same
any
negro
mulatto
or
other
person
of
color
the
captain
of
the
ship
was
also
to
be
punished
after
some
opposition
the
bill
became
a
law
february
of
the
from
to
meantime
in
spite
of
the
prohibitory
state
laws
the
african
to
the
united
states
continued
to
flourish
it
was
notorious
that
new
england
traders
carried
on
a
large
traffic
members
stated
on
the
floor
of
the
house
that
it
was
much
to
be
regretted
that
the
severe
and
pointed
statute
against
the
slave
trade
had
been
so
little
regarded
in
defiance
of
its
forbiddance
and
its
penalties
it
was
well
known
that
citizens
and
vessels
of
the
united
states
were
still
engaged
in
that
traffic
in
various
parts
of
the
nation
outfits
were
made
for
without
secrecy
shame
or
apprehension
countenanced
by
their
at
home
who
were
as
ready
to
buy
as
they
themselves
were
to
collect
and
to
bring
to
market
they
approached
our
southern
harbors
and
inlets
and
clandestinely
disembarked
the
sooty
offspring
of
the
eastern
upon
the
ill
fated
soil
of
the
western
hemisphere
in
this
way
it
had
been
computed
that
during
the
last
twelve
months
twenty
thousand
enslaved
negroes
had
been
transported
from
guinea
and
by
smuggling
added
to
the
plantation
stock
of
georgia
and
south
carolina
so
little
respect
seems
to
have
been
paid
to
the
existing
prohibitory
statute
that
it
may
almost
be
considered
as
disregarded
by
common
consent
these
voyages
were
generally
made
under
the
flag
of
a
foreign
nation
and
often
the
vessel
was
sold
in
a
foreign
port
to
escape
confiscation
south
carolina
own
congressman
confessed
that
although
the
state
had
prohibited
the
trade
since
she
was
unable
to
enforce
her
laws
with
navigable
rivers
running
into
the
heart
of
it
said
he
it
was
impossible
with
our
means
to
prevent
our
eastern
brethren
who
in
some
parts
of
the
union
in
defiance
of
the
authority
of
the
general
government
have
been
engaged
in
this
trade
from
introducing
them
into
the
country
the
law
was
completely
evaded
and
for
the
last
year
or
two
africans
were
introduced
into
the
country
in
numbers
little
short
i
believe
of
what
they
would
have
been
had
the
trade
been
a
legal
one
the
same
tale
undoubtedly
might
have
been
told
of
georgia
south
carolina
repeal
of
this
vast
and
apparently
irrepressible
illicit
traffic
was
one
of
three
causes
which
led
south
carolina
december
to
throw
aside
all
pretence
and
legalize
her
growing
the
other
two
causes
were
the
growing
certainty
of
total
prohibition
of
the
traffic
in
and
the
recent
purchase
of
louisiana
by
the
united
states
with
its
vast
prospective
demand
for
slave
labor
such
a
combination
of
advantages
which
meant
fortunes
to
planters
and
charleston
could
not
longer
be
withheld
from
them
the
prohibition
was
repealed
and
the
united
states
became
again
for
the
first
time
in
at
least
five
years
a
legal
slave
mart
this
action
shocked
the
nation
frightening
southern
states
with
visions
of
an
influx
of
untrained
barbarians
and
servile
insurrections
and
arousing
and
intensifying
the
feeling
of
the
north
which
had
long
since
come
to
think
of
the
trade
so
far
as
legal
enactment
went
as
a
thing
of
the
past
scarcely
a
month
after
this
repeal
bard
of
pennsylvania
solemnly
addressed
congress
on
the
matter
for
many
reasons
said
he
this
house
must
have
been
justly
surprised
by
a
recent
measure
of
one
of
the
southern
states
the
impressions
however
which
that
measure
gave
my
mind
were
deep
and
painful
had
i
been
informed
that
some
formidable
foreign
power
had
invaded
our
country
i
would
not
i
ought
not
be
more
alarmed
than
on
hearing
that
south
carolina
had
repealed
her
law
prohibiting
the
importation
of
slaves
our
hands
are
tied
and
we
are
obliged
to
stand
confounded
while
we
see
the
opened
and
pouring
incalculable
miseries
into
our
country
he
then
moved
as
the
utmost
legal
measure
a
tax
of
ten
dollars
per
head
on
slaves
imported
debate
on
this
proposition
did
not
occur
until
february
when
lowndes
explained
the
circumstances
of
the
repeal
and
a
long
controversy
took
place
those
in
favor
of
the
tax
argued
that
the
trade
was
wrong
and
that
the
tax
would
serve
as
some
slight
check
the
tax
was
not
inequitable
for
if
a
state
did
not
wish
to
bear
it
she
had
only
to
prohibit
the
trade
the
tax
would
add
to
the
revenue
and
be
at
the
same
time
a
moral
protest
against
an
unjust
and
dangerous
traffic
against
this
it
was
argued
that
if
the
tax
furnished
a
revenue
it
would
defeat
its
own
object
and
make
prohibition
more
difficult
in
it
was
inequitable
because
it
was
aimed
against
one
state
and
would
fall
exclusively
on
agriculture
it
would
give
national
sanction
to
the
trade
it
would
look
like
an
attempt
in
the
general
government
to
correct
a
state
for
the
undisputed
exercise
of
its
constitutional
powers
the
revenue
would
be
inconsiderable
and
the
united
states
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
moral
principle
while
a
prohibitory
tax
would
be
defensible
a
small
tax
like
this
would
be
useless
as
a
protection
and
criminal
as
a
revenue
measure
the
whole
debate
hinged
on
the
expediency
of
the
measure
few
defending
south
carolina
action
finally
a
bill
was
ordered
to
be
brought
in
which
was
done
on
the
another
long
debate
took
place
covering
substantially
the
same
ground
it
was
several
times
hinted
that
if
the
matter
were
dropped
south
carolina
might
again
prohibit
the
trade
this
and
the
vehement
opposition
at
last
resulted
in
the
postponement
of
the
bill
and
it
was
not
heard
from
again
during
the
session
louisiana
about
this
time
the
cession
of
louisiana
brought
before
congress
the
question
of
the
status
of
slavery
and
the
in
the
territories
twice
or
thrice
before
had
the
subject
called
for
attention
the
first
time
was
in
the
congress
of
the
confederation
when
by
the
ordinance
of
both
slavery
and
the
were
excluded
from
the
northwest
territory
in
congress
had
accepted
the
cession
of
north
carolina
back
lands
on
the
express
condition
that
slavery
there
be
undisturbed
nothing
had
been
said
as
to
slavery
in
the
south
carolina
cession
but
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
the
provision
of
the
northwest
ordinance
would
not
be
applied
in
the
bill
introduced
for
the
cession
of
mississippi
contained
a
specific
declaration
that
the
clause
of
should
not
be
included
the
bill
passed
the
senate
but
caused
long
and
excited
debate
in
the
house
it
was
argued
on
the
one
hand
that
the
case
in
mississippi
was
different
from
that
in
the
northwest
territory
because
slavery
was
a
legal
institution
in
all
the
surrounding
country
and
to
prohibit
the
institution
was
virtually
to
prohibit
the
settling
of
the
country
on
the
other
hand
gallatin
declared
that
if
this
amendment
should
not
obtain
he
knew
not
how
slaves
could
be
prevented
from
being
introduced
by
way
of
new
orleans
by
persons
who
are
not
citizens
of
the
united
states
it
was
moved
to
strike
out
the
excepting
clause
but
the
motion
received
only
twelve
votes
an
apparent
indication
that
congress
either
did
not
appreciate
the
great
precedent
it
was
establishing
or
was
reprehensibly
careless
harper
of
south
carolina
then
succeeded
in
building
up
the
charleston
interest
by
a
section
forbidding
the
slave
traffic
from
without
the
limits
of
the
united
states
thatcher
moved
to
strike
out
the
last
clause
of
this
amendment
and
thus
to
prohibit
the
interstate
trade
but
he
failed
to
get
a
second
thus
the
act
passed
punishing
the
introduction
of
slaves
from
without
the
country
by
a
fine
of
for
each
slave
and
freeing
the
slave
in
president
jefferson
communicated
papers
to
congress
on
the
status
of
slavery
and
the
in
louisiana
the
spanish
had
allowed
the
traffic
by
edict
in
france
had
not
stopped
it
and
governor
claiborne
had
refrained
from
interference
a
bill
erecting
a
territorial
government
was
already
pending
the
northern
district
of
louisiana
was
placed
under
the
jurisdiction
of
indiana
territory
and
was
made
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
of
various
attempts
were
made
to
amend
the
part
of
the
bill
referring
to
the
southern
territory
first
so
as
completely
to
prohibit
the
then
to
compel
the
emancipation
at
a
certain
age
of
all
those
imported
next
to
confine
all
importation
to
that
from
the
states
and
finally
to
limit
it
further
to
slaves
imported
before
south
carolina
opened
her
ports
the
last
two
amendments
prevailed
and
the
final
act
also
extended
to
the
territory
the
acts
of
and
only
slaves
imported
before
may
could
be
introduced
and
those
must
be
slaves
of
actual
settlers
all
slaves
illegally
imported
were
freed
this
stringent
act
was
limited
to
one
year
the
next
year
in
accordance
with
the
urgent
petition
of
the
inhabitants
a
bill
was
introduced
against
these
restrictions
by
dexterous
wording
this
bill
which
became
a
law
march
swept
away
all
restrictions
upon
the
except
that
relating
to
foreign
ports
and
left
even
this
provision
so
ambiguous
that
later
by
judicial
interpretation
of
the
law
the
foreign
was
allowed
at
least
for
a
time
such
a
stream
of
slaves
now
poured
into
the
new
territory
that
the
following
year
a
committee
on
the
matter
was
appointed
by
the
house
the
committee
reported
that
they
are
in
possession
of
the
fact
that
african
slaves
lately
imported
into
charleston
have
been
thence
conveyed
into
the
territory
of
orleans
and
in
their
opinion
this
practice
will
be
continued
to
a
very
great
extent
while
there
is
no
law
to
prevent
it
the
house
ordered
a
bill
checking
this
to
be
prepared
and
such
a
bill
was
reported
but
was
soon
dropped
importations
into
south
carolina
during
this
time
reached
enormous
proportions
senator
smith
of
that
state
declared
from
official
returns
that
between
and
negroes
were
imported
into
charleston
most
of
whom
went
to
the
territories
attempts
at
taxation
so
alarming
did
the
trade
become
that
north
carolina
passed
a
resolution
in
december
proposing
that
the
states
give
congress
power
to
prohibit
the
trade
massachusetts
vermont
new
hampshire
and
maryland
responded
and
a
joint
resolution
was
introduced
in
the
house
proposing
as
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
shall
have
power
to
prevent
the
further
importation
of
slaves
into
the
united
states
and
the
territories
thereof
nothing
came
of
this
effort
but
meantime
the
project
of
taxation
was
revived
a
motion
to
this
effect
made
in
february
was
referred
to
a
committee
of
the
whole
but
was
not
discussed
early
in
the
first
session
of
the
ninth
congress
the
motion
of
was
renewed
and
although
again
postponed
on
the
assurance
that
south
carolina
was
about
to
stop
the
trade
it
finally
came
up
for
debate
january
then
occurred
a
most
stubborn
legislative
battle
which
lasted
during
the
whole
session
several
amendments
to
the
motion
were
first
introduced
so
as
to
make
it
apply
to
all
immigrants
and
again
to
all
persons
of
color
as
in
the
former
debate
it
was
proposed
to
substitute
a
resolution
of
censure
on
south
carolina
all
these
amendments
were
lost
a
long
debate
on
the
expediency
of
the
measure
followed
on
the
old
grounds
early
of
georgia
dwelt
especially
on
the
double
taxation
it
would
impose
on
georgia
others
estimated
that
a
revenue
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
might
be
derived
from
the
tax
a
sum
sufficient
to
replace
the
tax
on
pepper
and
medicines
angry
charges
and
were
made
that
georgia
though
ashamed
openly
to
avow
the
trade
participated
in
it
as
well
as
south
carolina
some
recriminations
ensued
between
several
members
on
the
participation
of
the
traders
of
some
of
the
new
england
states
in
carrying
on
the
slave
trade
finally
january
by
a
vote
of
to
a
tax
bill
was
ordered
to
be
brought
in
one
was
reported
on
the
every
sort
of
opposition
was
resorted
to
on
the
one
hand
attempts
were
made
to
amend
it
so
as
to
prohibit
importation
after
and
to
prevent
importation
into
the
territories
on
the
other
hand
attempts
were
made
to
recommit
and
postpone
the
measure
it
finally
got
a
third
reading
but
was
recommitted
to
a
select
committee
and
disappeared
until
february
being
then
amended
so
as
to
provide
for
the
forfeiture
of
smuggled
cargoes
but
saying
nothing
as
to
the
disposition
of
the
slaves
it
was
again
relegated
to
a
committee
after
a
vote
of
to
against
postponement
on
march
it
appeared
again
and
a
motion
to
reject
it
was
lost
finally
in
the
midst
of
the
war
scare
and
the
question
of
of
british
goods
the
bill
was
apparently
forgotten
and
the
last
attempt
to
tax
imported
slaves
ended
like
the
others
in
failure
of
the
one
of
the
last
acts
of
this
period
strikes
again
the
which
sounded
throughout
the
whole
of
it
on
february
after
considerable
opposition
a
bill
to
prohibit
trade
with
san
domingo
passed
the
senate
in
the
house
it
was
charged
by
one
side
that
the
measure
was
dictated
by
france
and
by
the
other
that
it
originated
in
the
fear
of
countenancing
negro
insurrection
the
bill
however
became
a
law
and
by
continuations
remained
on
the
until
even
at
that
distance
the
nightmare
of
the
haytian
insurrection
continued
to
haunt
the
south
and
a
proposal
to
reopen
trade
with
the
island
caused
wild
john
randolph
to
point
out
the
dreadful
evil
of
a
direct
trade
betwixt
the
town
of
charleston
and
the
ports
of
the
island
of
st
domingo
of
the
twenty
years
from
to
it
can
only
be
said
that
they
were
on
the
whole
a
period
of
disappointment
so
far
as
the
suppression
of
the
was
concerned
fear
interest
and
philanthropy
united
for
a
time
in
an
effort
which
bade
fair
to
suppress
the
trade
then
the
real
weakness
of
the
constitutional
compromise
appeared

another
scarcely

potent
influence
was
naturally
the
great
movement
in

which
after
a
mighty
struggle
of
eighteen
years
was
about
to
gain
its
first
victory
in
the
british
act
of
president
jefferson
in

pacificatory
message
of
december
said
i
congratulate
you
on
the
approach
of
the
period
at
which
you
may
interpose
your
authority
constitutionally
to
withdraw
the
citizens
of
the

from
all
further
participation
in
those
violations
of
human
rights
which
have
been
so
long
continued
on
the
unoffending
inhabitants
of
africa
and
which
the
morality
the
reputation
and
the
best
interests
of
our
country
have
long
been
eager
to
proscribe
although
no
law
you
may
pass
can
take
prohibitory
effect
till
the
first
day
of

one

eight

yet
the
intervening
period
is
not
too
long
to
prevent
by
timely
notice
expeditions
which
can
not
be
completed
before
that
day
in
pursuance
of
this
recommendation
the
very
next
day
senator
bradley
of
vermont
introduced
into
the
senate
a
bill
which
after
a
complicated
legislative
history
became
the
act
of
march
prohibiting
the
african
three
main
questions
were
to
be
settled
by
this
bill
first
and
most
prominent
that
of
the
disposal
of
illegally
imported
africans
second
that
of
the
punishment
of
those
concerned
in
the
importation
third
that
of
the
proper
limitation
of
the
interstate
traffic
by
water
the
character
of
the
debate
on
these
three
questions
as
well
as
the
state
of
public
opinion
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
forty
of
the
sixty
pages
of
officially
reported
debates
are
devoted
to
the
first
question
less
than
twenty
to
the
second
and
only
two
to
the
third
a
sad
commentary
on
the
previous
enforcement
of
state
and
national
laws
is
the
readiness
with
which
it
was
admitted
that
wholesale
violations
of
the
law
would
take
place
indeed
southern
men
declared
that
no
strict
law
against
the
could
be
executed
in
the
south
and
that
it
was
only
by
playing
on
the
motives
of
personal
interest
that
the
trade
could
be
checked
the
question
of
punishment
indicated
the
slowly
changing
moral
attitude
of
the
south
toward
the
slave
system
early
boldly
said
a
large
majority
of
people
in
the
southern
states
do
not
consider
slavery
as
even
an
evil
the
south
in
fact
insisted
on
regarding
as
a
minor
offence
a
misdemeanor
rather
than
a
crime
finally
in
the
short
and
sharp
debate
on
the
interstate
coastwise
trade
the
growing
economic
side
of
the
slavery
question
came
to
the
front
the
vested
interests
argument
was
squarely
put
and
the
future
interstate
trade
almost
consciously
provided
for
from
these
considerations
it
is
doubtful
as
to
how
far
it
was
expected
that
the
act
of
would
check
the
slave
traffic
at
any
rate
so
far
as
the
south
was
concerned
there
seemed
to
be
an
evident
desire
to
limit
the
trade
but
little
thought
that
this
statute
would
definitively
suppress
it
first
question
how
shall
illegally
imported
africans
be
disposed
of
the
dozen
or
more
propositions
on
the
question
of
the
disposal
of
illegally
imported
africans
may
be
divided
into
two
chief
heads
representing
two
radically
opposed
parties
that
illegally
imported
africans
be
free
although
they
might
be
indentured
for
a
term
of
years
or
removed
from
the
country
that
such
africans
be
sold
as
slaves
the
arguments
on
these
two
propositions
which
were
many
and
may
be
roughly
divided
into
three
classes
political
constitutional
and
moral
the
political
argument
reduced
to
its
lowest
terms
ran
thus
those
wishing
to
free
the
negroes
illegally
imported
declared
that
to
enslave
them
would
be
to
perpetrate
the
very
evil
which
the
law
was
designed
to
stop
by
the
same
law
they
said
we
condemn
the
and
become
the
receivers
of
his
stolen
goods
we
punish
the
criminal
and
then
step
into
his
place
and
complete
the
crime
they
said
that
the
objection
to
free
negroes
was
no
valid
excuse
for
if
the
southern
people
really
feared
this
class
they
would
consent
to
the
imposing
of
such
penalties
on
illicit
traffic
as
would
stop
the
importation
of
a
single
slave
moreover
forfeiture
and
sale
of
the
negroes
implied
a
property
right
in
them
which
did
not
exist
waiving
this
technical
point
and
allowing
them
to
be
forfeited
to
the
government
then
the
government
should
either
immediately
set
them
free
or
at
the
most
indenture
them
for
a
term
of
years
otherwise
the
law
would
be
an
encouragement
to
violators
it
certainly
will
be
said
they
if
the
importer
can
find
means
to
evade
the
penalty
of
the
act
for
there
he
has
all
the
advantage
of
a
market
enhanced
by
our
ineffectual
attempt
to
prohibit
they
claimed
that
even
the
indenturing
of
the
ignorant
barbarian
for
life
was
better
than
slavery
and
sloan
declared
that
the
northern
states
would
receive
the
freed
negroes
willingly
rather
than
have
them
enslaved
the
argument
of
those
who
insisted
that
the
negroes
should
be
sold
was
tersely
put
by
macon
in
adopting
our
measures
on
this
subject
we
must
pass
such
a
law
as
can
be
executed
early
expanded
this
it
is
a
principle
in
legislation
as
correct
as
any
which
has
ever
prevailed
that
to
give
effect
to
laws
you
must
not
make
them
repugnant
to
the
passions
and
wishes
of
the
people
among
whom
they
are
to
operate
how
then
in
this
instance
stands
the
fact
do
not
gentlemen
from
every
quarter
of
the
union
prove
on
the
discussion
of
every
question
that
has
ever
arisen
in
the
house
having
the
most
remote
bearing
on
the
giving
freedom
to
the
africans
in
the
bosom
of
our
country
that
it
has
excited
the
deepest
sensibility
in
the
breasts
of
those
where
slavery
exists
and
why
is
this
so
it
is
because
those
who
from
experience
know
the
extent
of
the
evil
believe
that
the
most
formidable
aspect
in
which
it
can
present
itself
is
by
making
these
people
free
among
them
yes
sir
though
slavery
is
an
evil
regretted
by
every
man
in
the
country
to
have
among
us
in
any
considerable
quantity
persons
of
this
description
is
an
evil
far
greater
than
slavery
itself
does
any
gentleman
want
proof
of
this
i
answer
that
all
proof
is
useless
no
fact
can
be
more
notorious
with
this
belief
on
the
minds
of
the
people
where
slavery
exists
and
where
the
importation
will
take
place
if
at
all
we
are
about
to
turn
loose
in
a
state
of
freedom
all
persons
brought
in
after
the
passage
of
this
law
i
ask
gentlemen
to
reflect
and
say
whether
such
a
law
opposed
to
the
ideas
the
passions
the
views
and
the
affections
of
the
people
of
the
southern
states
can
be
executed
i
tell
them
no
it
is
impossible
why
because
no
man
will
inform
why
because
to
inform
will
be
to
lead
to
an
evil
which
will
be
deemed
greater
than
the
offence
of
which
information
is
given
because
it
will
be
opposed
to
the
principle
of
and
to
the
love
of
family
no
no
man
will
be
disposed
to
jeopard
his
life
and
the
lives
of
his
countrymen
and
if
no
one
dare
inform
the
whole
authority
of
the
government
can
not
carry
the
law
into
effect
the
whole
people
will
rise
up
against
it
why
because
to
enforce
it
would
be
to
turn
loose
in
the
bosom
of
the
country
firebrands
that
would
consume
them
this
was
the
more
tragic
form
of
the
argument
it
also
had
a
mercenary
side
which
was
presented
with
equal
emphasis
it
was
repeatedly
said
that
the
only
way
to
enforce
the
law
was
to
play
off
individual
interests
against
each
other
the
profit
from
the
sale
of
illegally
imported
negroes
was
declared
to
be
the
only
sufficient
inducement
to
give
information
of
their
importation
give
up
the
idea
of
forfeiture
and
i
challenge
the
gentleman
to
invent
fines
penalties
or
punishments
of
any
sort
sufficient
to
restrain
the
slave
trade
if
such
negroes
be
freed
i
tell
you
that
slaves
will
continue
to
be
imported
as
heretofore
you
can
not
get
hold
of
the
ships
employed
in
this
traffic
besides
slaves
will
be
brought
into
georgia
from
east
florida
they
will
be
brought
into
the
mississippi
territory
from
the
bay
of
mobile
you
can
not
inflict
any
other
penalty
or
devise
any
other
adequate
means
of
prevention
than
a
forfeiture
of
the
africans
in
whose
possession
they
may
be
found
after
importation
then
too
when
foreigners
smuggled
in
negroes
who
then
could
be
operated
on
but
the
purchasers
there
was
the
rub
it
was
their
interest
alone
which
by
being
operated
on
would
produce
a
check
snap
their
break
open
their
strong
box
deprive
them
of
their
slaves
and
by
destroying
the
temptation
to
buy
you
put
an
end
to
the
trade
nothing
short
of
a
forfeiture
of
the
slave
would
afford
an
effectual
remedy
again
it
was
argued
that
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
imported
negroes
from
becoming
slaves
or
what
was
just
as
bad
from
being
sold
as
vagabonds
or
indentured
for
life
even
our
own
laws
it
was
said
recognize
the
title
of
the
african
slave
factor
in
the
transported
negroes
and
if
the
importer
have
no
title
why
do
we
legislate
why
not
let
the
african
immigrant
alone
to
get
on
as
he
may
just
as
we
do
the
irish
immigrant
if
he
should
be
returned
to
africa
his
home
could
not
be
found
and
he
would
in
all
probability
be
sold
into
slavery
again
the
constitutional
argument
was
not
urged
as
seriously
as
the
foregoing
but
it
had
a
considerable
place
on
the
one
hand
it
was
urged
that
if
the
negroes
were
forfeited
they
were
forfeited
to
the
united
states
government
which
could
dispose
of
them
as
it
saw
fit
on
the
other
hand
it
was
said
that
the
united
states
as
owner
was
subject
to
state
laws
and
could
not
free
the
negroes
contrary
to
such
laws
some
alleged
that
the
freeing
of
such
negroes
struck
at
the
title
to
all
slave
property
others
thought
that
as
property
in
slaves
was
not
recognized
in
the
constitution
it
could
not
be
in
a
statute
the
question
also
arose
as
to
the
source
of
the
power
of
congress
over
the
southern
men
derived
it
from
the
clause
on
commerce
and
declared
that
it
exceeded
the
power
of
congress
to
declare
negroes
imported
into
a
slave
state
free
against
the
laws
of
that
state
that
congress
could
not
determine
what
should
or
should
not
be
property
in
a
state
northern
men
replied
that
according
to
this
principle
forfeiture
and
sale
in
massachusetts
would
be
illegal
that
the
power
of
congress
over
the
trade
was
derived
from
the
restraining
clause
as
a
power
could
not
be
restrained
and
that
the
united
states
could
act
under
her
general
powers
as
executor
of
the
law
of
nations
the
moral
argument
as
to
the
disposal
of
illegally
imported
negroes
was
interlarded
with
all
the
others
on
the
one
side
it
began
with
the
rights
of
man
and
descended
to
a
stickling
for
the
decent
appearance
of
the
on
the
other
side
it
began
with
the
uplifting
of
the
heathen
and
descended
to
a
denial
of
the
applicability
of
moral
principles
to
the
question
said
holland
of
north
carolina
it
is
admitted
that
the
condition
of
the
slaves
in
the
southern
states
is
much
superior
to
that
of
those
in
africa
who
then
will
say
that
the
trade
is
immoral
but
in
fact
morality
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
traffic
for
as
joseph
clay
declared
it
must
appear
to
every
man
of
common
sense
that
the
question
could
be
considered
in
a
commercial
point
of
view
only
the
other
side
declared
that
by
the
laws
of
god
and
man
these
captured
negroes
are
entitled
to
their
freedom
as
clearly
and
absolutely
as
we
are
nevertheless
some
were
willing
to
leave
them
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
slave
states
so
long
as
the
was
disgraced
by
no
explicit
recognition
of
slavery
such
arguments
brought
some
sharp
sarcasm
on
those
who
seemed
anxious
to
legislate
for
the
honor
and
glory
of
the
statute
book
some
desired
to
know
what
honor
you
will
derive
from
a
law
that
will
be
broken
every
day
of
your
lives
they
would
rather
boldly
sell
the
negroes
and
turn
the
proceeds
over
to
charity
the
final
settlement
of
the
question
was
as
follows
section
and
neither
the
importer
nor
any
person
or
persons
claiming
from
or
under
him
shall
hold
any
right
or
title
whatsoever
to
any
negro
mulatto
or
person
of
color
nor
to
the
service
or
labor
thereof
who
may
be
imported
or
brought
within
the
united
states
or
territories
thereof
in
violation
of
this
law
but
the
same
shall
remain
subject
to
any
regulations
not
contravening
the
provisions
of
this
act
which
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
or
territories
at
any
time
hereafter
may
make
for
disposing
of
any
such
negro
mulatto
or
person
of
color
second
question
how
shall
violations
be
punished
the
next
point
in
importance
was
that
of
the
punishment
of
offenders
the
specific
propositions
reduce
themselves
to
two
a
violation
should
be
considered
a
crime
or
felony
and
be
punished
by
death
a
violation
should
be
considered
a
misdemeanor
and
be
punished
by
fine
and
imprisonment
advocates
of
the
severer
punishment
dwelt
on
the
enormity
of
the
offence
it
was
one
of
the
highest
crimes
man
could
commit
and
a
captain
of
a
ship
engaged
in
this
traffic
was
guilty
of
murder
the
law
of
god
punished
the
crime
with
death
and
any
one
would
rather
be
hanged
than
be
enslaved
it
was
a
peculiarly
deliberate
crime
in
which
the
offender
did
not
act
in
sudden
passion
but
had
ample
time
for
reflection
then
too
crimes
of
much
less
magnitude
are
punished
with
death
shall
we
punish
the
stealer
of
with
death
and
the
with
imprisonment
only
piracy
forgery
and
fraudulent
sinking
of
vessels
are
punishable
with
death
yet
these
are
crimes
only
against
property
whereas
the
importation
of
slaves
a
crime
committed
against
the
liberty
of
man
and
inferior
only
to
murder
or
treason
is
accounted
nothing
but
a
misdemeanor
here
indeed
lies
the
remedy
for
the
evil
of
freeing
illegally
imported
negroes
in
making
the
penalty
so
severe
that
none
will
be
brought
in
if
the
south
is
sincere
they
will
unite
to
a
man
to
execute
the
law
to
free
such
negroes
is
dangerous
to
enslave
them
wrong
to
return
them
impracticable
to
indenture
them
difficult
therefore
by
a
death
penalty
keep
them
from
being
imported
here
the
east
had
a
chance
to
throw
back
the
taunts
of
the
south
by
urging
the
south
to
unite
with
them
in
hanging
the
new
england
assuring
the
south
that
so
far
from
charging
their
southern
brethren
with
cruelty
or
severity
in
hanging
them
they
would
acknowledge
the
favor
with
gratitude
finally
if
the
southerners
would
refuse
to
execute
so
severe
a
law
because
they
did
not
consider
the
offence
great
they
would
probably
refuse
to
execute
any
law
at
all
for
the
same
reason
the
opposition
answered
that
the
death
penalty
was
more
than
proportionate
to
the
crime
and
therefore
immoral
i
can
not
believe
said
stanton
of
rhode
island
that
a
man
ought
to
be
hung
for
only
stealing
a
negro
it
was
argued
that
the
trade
was
after
all
but
a
transfer
from
one
master
to
another
that
slavery
was
worse
than
the
and
the
south
did
not
consider
slavery
a
crime
how
could
it
then
punish
the
trade
so
severely
and
not
reflect
on
the
institution
severity
it
was
said
was
also
inexpedient
severity
often
increases
crime
if
the
punishment
is
too
great
people
will
sympathize
with
offenders
and
will
not
inform
against
them
said
mosely
when
the
penalty
is
excessive
or
disproportioned
to
the
offence
it
will
naturally
create
a
repugnance
to
the
law
and
render
its
execution
odious
john
randolph
argued
against
even
fine
and
imprisonment
on
the
ground
that
such
an
excessive
penalty
could
not
in
such
case
be
constitutionally
imposed
by
a
government
possessed
of
the
limited
powers
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
bill
as
passed
punished
infractions
as
follows
for
equipping
a
slaver
a
fine
of
and
forfeiture
of
the
ship
for
transporting
negroes
a
fine
of
and
forfeiture
of
the
ship
and
negroes
for
transporting
and
selling
negroes
a
fine
of
to
imprisonment
from
to
years
and
forfeiture
of
the
ship
and
negroes
for
knowingly
buying
illegally
imported
negroes
a
fine
of
for
each
negro
and
forfeiture
third
question
how
shall
the
interstate
coastwise
be
protected
the
first
proposition
was
to
prohibit
the
coastwise
altogether
but
an
amendment
reported
to
the
house
allowed
it
in
any
vessel
or
species
of
craft
whatever
it
is
probable
that
the
first
proposition
would
have
prevailed
had
it
not
been
for
the
vehement
opposition
of
randolph
and
early
they
probably
foresaw
the
value
which
virginia
would
derive
from
this
trade
in
the
future
and
consequently
randolph
violently
declared
that
if
the
amendment
did
not
prevail
the
southern
people
would
set
the
law
at
defiance
he
would
begin
the
example
he
maintained
that
by
the
first
proposition
the
proprietor
of
sacred
and
chartered
rights
is
prevented
the
constitutional
use
of
his
property
the
conference
committee
finally
arranged
a
compromise
forbidding
the
coastwise
trade
for
purposes
of
sale
in
vessels
under
forty
tons
this
did
not
suit
early
who
declared
that
the
law
with
this
provision
would
not
prevent
the
introduction
of
a
single
slave
randolph
too
would
rather
lose
the
bill
he
had
rather
lose
all
the
bills
of
the
session
he
had
rather
lose
every
bill
passed
since
the
establishment
of
the
government
than
agree
to
the
provision
contained
in
this
slave
bill
he
predicted
the
severance
of
the
slave
and
the
free
states
if
disunion
should
ever
come
congress
was
however
weary
with
the
dragging
of
the
bill

one

the

those
in

were
prolonged

bitter

hinged
especially
on
the
disposal
of
the

the
punishment
of
offenders
and
the

were
continually

the

backward
and
forward

and
out

a
great
victory
of
the
the
period
so
confidently
looked
forward
to
by
the
constitutional
fathers
had
at
last
arrived
the
was
prohibited
and
much
oratory
and
poetry
were
expended
in
celebration
of
the
event
in
the
face
of
this
let
us
see
how
the
act
of
was
enforced
and
what
it
really
accomplished
it
is
noticeable
in
the
first
place
that
there
was
no
especial
set
of
machinery
provided
for
the
enforcement
of
this
act
the
work
fell
first
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
as
head
of
the
customs
collection
then
through
the
activity
of
cruisers
the
secretary
of
the
navy
gradually
came
to
have
oversight
and
eventually
the
whole
matter
was
lodged
with
him
although
the
departments
of
state
and
war
were
more
or
less
active
on
different
occasions
later
at
the
advent
of
the
lincoln
government
the
department
of
the
interior
was
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
it
would
indeed
be
surprising
if
amid
so
much
uncertainty
and
shifting
of
responsibility
the
law
were
not
poorly
enforced
poor
enforcement
moreover
in
the
years
to
meant
far
more
than
at
almost
any
other
period
for
these
years
were
all
over
the
european
world
a
time
of
stirring
economic
change
and
the
set
which
forces
might
then
take
would
in
a
later
period
be
unchangeable
without
a
cataclysm
perhaps
from
to
in
the
midst
of
agitation
and
war
there
was
some
excuse
for
carelessness
from
on
however
no
such
palliation
existed
and
the
law
was
probably
enforced
as
the
people
who
made
it
wished
it
enforced
most
of
the
southern
states
rather
tardily
passed
the
necessary
supplementary
acts
disposing
of
illegally
imported
africans
a
few
appear
not
to
have
passed
any
some
of
these
laws
like
the
territory
act
of
directed
such
negroes
to
be
sold
by
the
proper
officer
of
the
court
to
the
highest
bidder
at
public
auction
for
ready
money
the
proceeds
went
to
the
informer
or
to
the
collector
of
customs
the
other
half
to
the
public
treasury
other
acts
like
that
of
north
carolina
in
directed
the
negroes
to
be
sold
and
disposed
of
for
the
use
of
the
state
of
the
proceeds
went
to
the
informer
the
georgia
act
of
directed
that
the
slaves
be
either
sold
or
given
to
the
colonization
society
for
transportation
providing
the
society
reimburse
the
state
for
all
expense
incurred
and
pay
for
the
transportation
in
this
manner
machinery
of
somewhat
clumsy
build
and
varying
pattern
was
provided
for
the
carrying
out
of
the
national
act
of
the
continuance
of
the
undoubtedly
the
act
of
came
very
near
being
a
dead
letter
the
testimony
supporting
this
view
is
voluminous
it
consists
of
presidential
messages
reports
of
cabinet
officers
letters
of
collectors
of
revenue
letters
of
district
attorneys
reports
of
committees
of
congress
reports
of
naval
commanders
statements
made
on
the
floor
of
congress
the
testimony
of
and
the
complaints
of
home
and
foreign
societies
when
i
was
young
writes
fowler
of
connecticut
the
was
still
carried
on
by
connecticut
shipmasters
and
merchant
adventurers
for
the
supply
of
southern
ports
this
trade
was
carried
on
by
the
consent
of
the
southern
states
under
the
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution
until
and
after
that
time
clandestinely
there
was
a
good
deal
of
conversation
on
the
subject
in
private
circles
other
states
were
said
to
be
even
more
involved
than
connecticut
the
african
society
of
london
estimated
that
down
to
fifteen
of
the
sixty
thousand
slaves
annually
taken
from
africa
were
shipped
by
americans
notwithstanding
the
prohibitory
act
of
america
which
was
passed
in
ships
bearing
the
american
flag
continued
to
trade
for
slaves
until
when
in
consequence
of
a
decision
in
the
english
prize
appeal
courts
which
rendered
american
slave
ships
liable
to
capture
and
condemnation
that
flag
suddenly
disappeared
from
the
coast
its
place
was
almost
instantaneously
supplied
by
the
spanish
flag
which
with
one
or
two
exceptions
was
now
seen
for
the
first
time
on
the
african
coast
engaged
in
covering
the
slave
trade
this
sudden
substitution
of
the
spanish
for
the
american
flag
seemed
to
confirm
what
was
established
in
a
variety
of
instances
by
more
direct
testimony
that
the
slave
trade
which
now
for
the
first
time
assumed
a
spanish
dress
was
in
reality
only
the
trade
of
other
nations
in
disguise
so
notorious
did
the
participation
of
americans
in
the
traffic
become
that
president
madison
informed
congress
in
his
message
december
that
it
appears
that
american
citizens
are
instrumental
in
carrying
on
a
traffic
in
enslaved
africans
equally
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
humanity
and
in
defiance
of
those
of
their
own
country
the
same
just
and
benevolent
motives
which
produced
the
interdiction
in
force
against
this
criminal
conduct
will
doubtless
be
felt
by
congress
in
devising
further
means
of
suppressing
the
evil
the
secretary
of
the
navy
wrote
the
same
year
to
charleston
south
carolina
i
hear
not
without
great
concern
that
the
law
prohibiting
the
importation
of
slaves
has
been
violated
in
frequent
instances
near
st
mary
testimony
as
to
violations
of
the
law
and
suggestions
for
improving
it
also
came
in
from
district
attorneys
the
method
of
introducing
negroes
was
simple
a
slave
smuggler
says
after
resting
a
few
days
at
augustine
i
agreed
to
accompany
diego
on
a
land
trip
through
the
united
states
where
a
of
negroes
was
to
precede
us
for
whose
disposal
the
shrewd
portuguese
had
already
made
arrangements
with
my
uncle
consignees
i
soon
learned
how
readily
and
at
what
profits
the
florida
negroes
were
sold
into
the
neighboring
american
states
the
under
charge
of
negro
drivers
was
to
strike
up
the
escambia
river
and
thence
cross
the
boundary
into
georgia
where
some
of
our
wild
africans
were
mixed
with
various
squads
of
native
blacks
and
driven
inland
till
sold
off
singly
or
by
couples
on
the
road
at
this
period
the
united
states
had
declared
the
african
slave
trade
illegal
and
passed
stringent
laws
to
prevent
the
importation
of
negroes
yet
the
spanish
possessions
were
thriving
on
this
inland
exchange
of
negroes
and
mulattoes
florida
was
a
sort
of
nursery
for
and
many
american
citizens
grew
rich
by
trafficking
in
guinea
negroes
and
smuggling
them
continually
in
small
parties
through
the
southern
united
states
at
the
time
i
mention
the
business
was
a
lively
one
owing
to
the
war
then
going
on
between
the
states
and
england
and
the
unsettled
condition
of
affairs
on
the
border
the
spanish
flag
continued
to
cover
american
the
rapid
rise
of
privateering
during
the
war
was
not
caused
solely
by
patriotic
motives
for
many
armed
ships
fitted
out
in
the
united
states
obtained
a
thin
spanish
disguise
at
havana
and
transported
thousands
of
slaves
to
brazil
and
the
west
indies
sometimes
all
disguise
was
thrown
aside
and
the
american
flag
appeared
on
the
slave
coast
as
in
the
cases
of
the
paz
the
rebecca
the
rosa
formerly
the
privateer
commodore
perry
the
dorset
of
baltimore
and
the
saucy
jack
governor
mccarthy
of
sierra
leone
wrote
in
the
slave
trade
is
carried
on
most
vigorously
by
the
spaniards
portuguese
americans
and
french
i
have
had
it
affirmed
from
several
quarters
and
do
believe
it
to
be
a
fact
that
there
is
a
greater
number
of
vessels
employed
in
that
traffic
than
at
any
former
period
of
the
federal
the
united
states
cruisers
succeeded
now
and
then
in
capturing
a
slaver
like
the
eugene
which
was
taken
when
within
four
miles
of
the
new
orleans
bar
president
madison
again
in
urged
congress
to
act
on
account
of
the
violations
and
evasions
which
it
is
suggested
are
chargeable
on
unworthy
citizens
who
mingle
in
the
slave
trade
under
foreign
flags
and
with
foreign
ports
and
by
collusive
importations
of
slaves
into
the
united
states
through
adjoining
ports
and
territories
the
executive
was
continually
in
receipt
of
ample
evidence
of
this
illicit
trade
and
of
the
helplessness
of
officers
of
the
law
in
it
was
reported
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy
that
most
of
the
goods
carried
to
galveston
were
brought
into
the
united
states
the
more
valuable
and
the
slaves
are
smuggled
in
through
the
numerous
inlets
to
the
westward
where
the
people
are
but
too
much
disposed
to
render
them
every
possible
assistance
several
hundred
slaves
are
now
at
galveston
and
persons
have
gone
from
to
purchase
them
every
exertion
will
be
made
to
intercept
them
but
i
have
little
hopes
of
success
similar
letters
from
naval
officers
and
collectors
showed
that
a
system
of
slave
piracy
had
arisen
since
the
war
and
that
at
galveston
there
was
an
establishment
of
organized
brigands
who
did
not
go
to
the
trouble
of
sailing
to
africa
for
their
slaves
but
simply
captured
slavers
and
sold
their
cargoes
into
the
united
states
this
galveston
nest
had
in
eleven
armed
vessels
to
prosecute
the
work
and
the
most
shameful
violations
of
the
slave
act
as
well
as
our
revenue
laws
continue
to
be
practised
cargoes
of
as
many
as
three
hundred
slaves
were
arriving
in
texas
all
this
took
place
under
aury
the
buccaneer
governor
and
when
he
removed
to
amelia
island
in
with
the
mcgregor
raid
the
illicit
traffic
in
slaves
which
had
been
going
on
there
for
years
took
an
impulse
that
brought
it
even
to
the
somewhat
deaf
ears
of
collector
bullock
he
reported
may
i
have
just
received
information
from
a
source
on
which
i
can
implicitly
rely
that
it
has
already
become
the
practice
to
introduce
into
the
state
of
georgia
across
the
mary
river
from
amelia
island
east
florida
africans
who
have
been
carried
into
the
port
of
fernandina
subsequent
to
the
capture
of
it
by
the
patriot
army
now
in
possession
of
it
were
the
legislature
to
pass
an
act
giving
compensation
in
some
manner
to
informers
it
would
have
a
tendency
in
a
great
degree
to
prevent
the
practice
as
the
thing
now
is
no
citizen
will
take
the
trouble
of
searching
for
and
detecting
the
slaves
i
further
understand
that
the
evil
will
not
be
confined
altogether
to
africans
but
will
be
extended
to
the
worst
class
of
west
india
slaves
undoubtedly
the
injury
done
by
these
pirates
to
the
regular
interests
was
largely
instrumental
in
exterminating
them
late
in
united
states
troops
seized
amelia
island
and
president
monroe
felicitated
congress
and
the
country
upon
escaping
the
annoyance
and
injury
of
this
illicit
trade
the
trade
however
seems
to
have
continued
as
is
shown
by
such
letters
as
the
following
written
three
and
a
half
months
later
port
of
darien
march
it
is
a
painful
duty
sir
to
express
to
you
that
i
am
in
possession
of
undoubted
information
that
african
and
west
india
negroes
are
almost
daily
illicitly
introduced
into
georgia
for
sale
or
settlement
or
passing
through
it
to
the
territories
of
the
united
states
for
similar
purposes
these
facts
are
notorious
and
it
is
not
unusual
to
see
such
negroes
in
the
streets
of
mary
and
such
too
recently
captured
by
our
vessels
of
war
and
ordered
to
savannah
were
illegally
bartered
by
hundreds
in
that
city
this
bartering
or
bonding
as
is
but
in
reality
actually
took
place
before
any
decision
had
been
passed
by
the
court
respecting
them
i
can
not
but
again
express
to
you
sir
that
these
irregularities
and
mocking
of
the
laws
by
men
who
understand
them
and
who
it
was
presumed
would
have
respected
them
are
such
that
it
requires
the
immediate
interposition
of
congress
to
effect
a
suppression
of
this
traffic
for
as
things
are
should
a
faithful
officer
of
the
government
apprehend
such
negroes
to
avoid
the
penalties
imposed
by
the
laws
the
proprietors
disclaim
them
and
some
agent
of
the
executive
demands

indian

guilty
of
having
prostituted
his
power
as

for

at

to
the
purpose
of
aiding
and
assisting
in
a
conscious
breach
of
the
act
of
congress
of
in
prohibition
of
the
slave
trade
and
this
from
mercenary
motives
the
indefatigable
collector
chew
of
new
orleans
wrote
to
washington
that
to
put
a
stop
to
that
traffic
a
naval
force
suitable
to
those
waters
is
indispensable
and
that
vast
numbers
of
slaves
will
be
introduced
to
an
alarming
extent
unless
prompt
and
effectual
measures
are
adopted
by
the
general
government
other
collectors
continually
reported
infractions
complaining
that
they
could
get
no
assistance
from
the
citizens
or
plaintively
asking
the
services
of
one
small
cutter
meantime
what
was
the
response
of
the
government
to
such
representations
and
what
efforts
were
made
to
enforce
the
act
a
few
unsystematic
and
spasmodic
attempts
are
recorded
in
some
special
instructions
were
sent
out
and
the
president
was
authorized
to
seize
amelia
island
then
came
the
war
and
as
late
as
november
in
spite
of
the
complaints
of
collectors
we
find
no
revenue
cutter
on
the
gulf
coast
during
the
years
and
some
cruisers
went
there
irregularly
but
they
were
too
large
to
be
effective
and
the
partial
suppression
of
the
amelia
island
pirates
was
all
that
was
accomplished
on
the
whole
the
efforts
of
the
government
lacked
plan
energy
and
often
sincerity
some
captures
of
slavers
were
made
but
as
the
collector
at
mobile
wrote
anent
certain
cases
this
was
owing
rather
to
accident
than
any
arrangement
he
adds
from
the
chandalier
islands
to
the
perdido
river
including
the
coast
and
numerous
other
islands
we
have
only
a
small
boat
with
four
men
and
an
inspector
to
oppose
to
the
whole
confederacy
of
smugglers
and
pirates
to
cap
the
climax
the
government
officials
were
so
negligent
that
secretary
crawford
in
confessed
to
congress
that
it
appears
from
an
examination
of
the
records
of
this
office
that
no
particular
instructions
have
ever
been
given
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
under
the
original
or
supplementary
acts
prohibiting
the
introduction
of
slaves
into
the
united
states
beside
this
inactivity
the
government
was
criminally
negligent
in
not
prosecuting
and
punishing
offenders
when
captured
urgent
appeals
for
instruction
from
prosecuting
attorneys
were
too
often
received
in
official
silence
complaints
as
to
the
violation
of
law
by
state
officers
went
unheeded
informers
were
unprotected
and
sometimes
driven
from
home
indeed
the
most
severe
comment
on
the
whole
period
is
the
report
january
of
the
register
of
the
treasury
who
after
the
wholesale
and
open
violation
of
the
act
of
reported
in
response
to
a
request
from
the
house
that
it
doth
not
appear
from
an
examination
of
the
records
of
this
office
and
particularly
of
the
accounts
to
the
date
of
their
last
settlement
of
the
collectors
of
the
customs
and
of
the
several
marshals
of
the
united
states
that
any
forfeitures
had
been
incurred
under
the
said
act
at
this
date
january
however
certain
cases
were
stated
to
be
pending
a
history
of
which
will
fitly
conclude
this
discussion
in
three
american
schooners
sailed
from
the
united
states
to
havana
on
june
they
started
back
with
cargoes
aggregating
one
hundred
and
seven
slaves
the
schooner
constitution
was
captured
by
one
of
andrew
jackson
officers
under
the
guns
of
fort
barancas
the
louisa
and
marino
were
captured
by
lieutenant
mckeever
of
the
united
states
navy
the
three
vessels
were
duly
proceeded
against
at
mobile
and
the
case
began
slowly
to
drag
along
the
slaves
instead
of
being
put
under
the
care
of
the
zealous
marshal
of
the
district
were
placed
in
the
hands
of
three
bondsmen
friends
of
the
judge
the
marshal
notified
the
government
of
this
irregularity
but
apparently
received
no
answer
in
the
three
vessels
were
condemned
as
forfeited
but
the
court
reserved
for
future
order
the
distribution
of
the
slaves
nothing
whatever
either
then
or
later
was
done
to
the
themselves
the
owners
of
the
ships
promptly
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
that
tribunal
in
condemned
the
three
vessels
and
the
slaves
on
two
of
them
these
slaves
considerably
reduced
in
number
from
various
causes
were
sold
at
auction
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
in
spite
of
the
act
of
meantime
before
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
the
judge
of
the
supreme
court
of
west
florida
had
awarded
to
certain
alleged
spanish
claimants
of
the
slaves
indemnity
for
nearly
the
whole
number
seized
at
the
price
of
per
head
and
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
had
actually
paid
the
claim
in
lieutenant
mckeever
urgently
petitions
congress
for
his
of
which
he
has
not
yet
received
the
constitution
was
for
some
inexplicable
reason
released
from
bond
and
the
whole
case
fades
in
a
very
thick
cloud
of
official
mist
in
congress
sought
to
inquire
into
the
final
disposition
of
the
slaves
the
information
given
was
never
printed
but
as
late
as
a
certain
calvin
mickle
petitions
congress
for
reimbursement
for
the
slaves
sold
for
their
hire
for
their
natural
increase
for
expenses
incurred
and
for
damages
supplementary
acts
to
remedy
the
obvious
defects
of
the
act
of
two
courses
were
possible
one
to
minimize
the
crime
of
transportation
and
by
encouraging
informers
to
concentrate
efforts
against
the
buying
of
smuggled
slaves
the
other
to
make
the
crime
of
transportation
so
great
that
no
slaves
would
be
imported
the
act
of
tried
the
first
method
that
of
the
second
the
latter
was
obviously
the
more
upright
and
logical
and
the
only
method
deserving
thought
even
in
but
the
act
of
was
the
natural
descendant
of
that
series
of
compromises
which
began
in
the
constitutional
convention
and
which
instead
of
postponing
the
settlement
of
critical
questions
to
more
favorable
times
rather
aggravated
and
complicated
them
the
immediate
cause
of
the
act
of
was
the
amelia
island
scandal
committees
in
both
houses
reported
bills
but
that
of
the
senate
finally
passed
there
does
not
appear
to
have
been
very
much
debate
the
sale
of
africans
for
the
benefit
of
the
informer
and
of
the
united
states
was
strongly
urged
as
the
only
means
of
executing
the
laws
against
the
slave
trade
as
experience
had
fully
demonstrated
since
the
origin
of
the
prohibition
this
proposition
was
naturally
opposed
as
inconsistent
with
the
principles
of
our
government
and
calculated
to
throw
as
wide
open
the
door
to
the
importation
of
slaves
as
it
was
before
the
existing
prohibition
the
act
which
became
a
law
april
was
a
poorly
constructed
compromise
which
virtually
acknowledged
the
failure
of
efforts
to
control
the
trade
and
sought
to
remedy
defects
by
pitting
cupidity
against
cupidity
informer
against
thief
of
all
forfeitures
and
fines
were
to
go
to
the
informer
and
penalties
for
violation
were
changed
as
follows
for
equipping
a
slaver
instead
of
a
fine
of
a
fine
of
to
and
imprisonment
from
to
years
for
transporting
negroes
instead
of
a
fine
of
and
forfeiture
of
ship
and
negroes
a
fine
of
to
and
imprisonment
from
to
years
for
actual
importation
instead
of
a
fine
of
to
and
imprisonment
from
to
years
a
fine
of
to
and
imprisonment
from
to
years
for
knowingly
buying
illegally
imported
negroes
instead
of
a
fine
of
for
each
negro
and
forfeiture
a
fine
of
for
each
negro
the
burden
of
proof
was
laid
on
the
defendant
to
the
extent
that
he
must
prove
that
the
slave
in
question
had
been
imported
at
least
five
years
before
the
prosecution
the
slaves
were
still
left
to
the
disposal
of
the
states
this
statute
was
of
course
a
failure
from
the
start
and
at
the
very
next
session
congress
took
steps
to
revise
it
a
bill
was
reported
in
the
house
january
but
it
was
not
discussed
till
march
it
finally
passed
after
much
debate
the
senate
dropped
its
own
bill
and
after
striking
out
the
provision
for
the
death
penalty
passed
the
bill
as
it
came
from
the
house
the
house
acquiesced
and
the
bill
became
a
law
march
in
the
midst
of
the
missouri
trouble
this
act
directed
the
president
to
use
armed
cruisers
on
the
coasts
of
the
united
states
and
africa
to
suppress
the
the
proceeds
of
the
condemned
ship
were
to
go
to
the
captors
as
bounty
provided
the
africans
were
safely
lodged
with
a
united
states
marshal
and
the
crew
with
the
civil
authorities
these
provisions
were
seriously
marred
by
a
proviso
which
butler
of
louisiana
had
inserted
with
a
due
regard
for
the
interests
of
the
state
which
he
represented
that
a
captured
slaver
must
always
be
returned
to
the
port
whence
she
sailed
this
of
course
secured
decided
advantages
to
southern
the
most
radical
provision
of
the
act
was
that
which
directed
the
president
to
make
such
regulations
and
arrangements
as
he
may
deem
expedient
for
the
safe
keeping
support
and
removal
beyond
the
limits
of
the
united
states
of
all
such
negroes
mulattoes
or
persons
of
colour
as
may
be
so
delivered
and
brought
within
their
jurisdiction
and
to
appoint
an
agent
in
africa
to
receive
such
negroes
finally
an
appropriation
of
was
made
to
enforce
the
act
this
act
was
in
some
measure
due
to
the
new
colonization
movement
and
the
return
of
africans
recaptured
was
a
distinct
recognition
of
its
efforts
and
the
real
foundation
of
liberia
to
render
this
straightforward
act
effective
it
was
necessary
to
add
but
one
measure
and
that
was
a
penalty
commensurate
with
the
crime
of
slave
stealing
this
was
accomplished
by
the
act
of
may
a
law
which
may
be
regarded
as
the
last
of
the
missouri
compromise
measures
the
act
originated
from
the
various
bills
on
piracy
which
were
introduced
early
in
the
sixteenth
congress
the
house
bill
in
spite
of
opposition
was
amended
so
as
to
include
under
piracy
and
passed
the
senate
agreed
without
a
division
this
law

the
development

a

internal
and
the
consequent
rise

opposed

smuggling

to
a
falling
off
in

population
scarcely
one
in

is
ever
detected
by
the
officers

statement

would
perform
his
duty
by
attempting

is
by
many
considered
as
an
officious
meddler
and
treated
with
derision
and
contempt
i
have
been
told
by
a
gentleman
who
has
attended
particularly
to
this
subject
that
ten
thousand
slaves
were
in
one
year
smuggled
into
the
united
states
and
that
even
for
the
last
year
we
must
count
the
number
not
by
hundreds
but
by
thousands
in
a
committee
of

characterized
prevailing
methods
as
those
of
the
grossest
fraud
that
could
be
practised
to
deceive

another

in

a
careful
examination
of
the
subject
declare
that

find
it
impossible
to
measure
with
precision
the
effect
produced
upon
the
american
branch
of
the
slave
trade
by
the
laws
above
mentioned
and
the
seizures
under
them
they
are
unable
to
state
whether
those
american
merchants
the
american
capital
and
seamen
which
heretofore
aided
in
this
traffic
have
abandoned
it
altogether
or
have
sought
shelter
under
the
flags
of
other
nations
they
then
state
the
suspicious
circumstance
that
with
the
disappearance
of
the
american
flag
from
the
traffic
the
trade
notwithstanding
increases
annually
under
the
flags
of

since

on

african
agent
ayres
reported

informed
by
an
american
officer
who
had
been
on
the
coast
in
that
he
had
boarded
american
vessels
in
one
morning
lying
in
the
port
of
gallinas
and
fitted
for
the
reception
of
slaves
it
is
a
lamentable
fact
that
most
of
the
harbours
between
the
senegal
and
the
line
were
visited
by
an
equal
number
of
american
vessels
and
for
the
sole
purpose
of
carrying
away
slaves
although
for
some
years
the
coast
had
been
occasionally
visited
by
our
cruizers
their
short
stay
and
seldom
appearance
had
made
but
slight
impression
on
those
traders
rendered
hardy
by
repetition
of
crime
and
avaricious
by
excessive
gain
they
were
enabled
by
a
regular
system
to
gain
intelligence
of
any
cruizer
being
on
the
coast
even
such
spasmodic
efforts
bore
abundant
fruit
and
indicated
what
vigorous
measures
might
have
accomplished
between
may
and
november
nearly
six
hundred
africans
were
recaptured
and
eleven
american
slavers
taken
such
measures
gradually
changed
the
character
of
the
trade
and
opened
the
international
phase
of
the
question
american
slavers
cleared
for
foreign
ports
there
took
a
foreign
flag
and
papers
and
then
sailed
boldly
past
american
cruisers
although
their
real
character
was
often
well
known
more
stringent
clearance
laws
and
consular
instructions
might
have
greatly
reduced
this
practice
but
nothing
was
ever
done
and
gradually
the
laws
became
in
large
measure
powerless
to
deal
with
the
bulk
of
the
illicit
trade
in
september
a
british
officer
in
his
official
report
declares
that
in
spite
of
united
states
laws
american
vessels
american
subjects
and
american
capital
are
unquestionably
engaged
in
the
trade
though
under
other
colours
and
in
disguise
the
united
states
ship
cyane
at
one
time
reported
ten
captures
within
a
few
days
adding
although
they
are
evidently
owned
by
americans
they
are
so
completely
covered
by
spanish
papers
that
it
is
impossible
to
condemn
them
the
governor
of
sierra
leone
reported
the
rivers
nunez
and
pongas
full
of
renegade
european
and
american
the
trade
was
said
to
be
carried
on
to
an
extent
that
almost
staggers
belief
down
to
or
reports
from
all
quarters
prove
this
activity
in
the
execution
of
the
laws
within
the
country
exhibits
grave
defects
and
even
criminal
negligence
wirt
finds
it
necessary
to
assure
collectors
in
that
it
is
against
public
policy
to
dispense
with
prosecutions
for
violation
of
the
law
to
prohibit
the
slave
trade
one
district
attorney
writes
it
appears
to
be
almost
impossible
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
united
states
against
offenders
after
the
negroes
have
been
landed
in
the
state
again
it
is
asserted
that
when
vessels
engaged
in
the
slave
trade
have
been
detained
by
the
american
cruizers
and
sent
into
the
states
there
appears
at
once
a
difficulty
in
securing
the
freedom
to
these
captives
which
the
laws
of
the
united
states
have
decreed
for
them
in
some
cases
one
man
would
smuggle
in
the
africans
and
hide
them
in
the
woods
then
his
partner
would
rob
him
and
so
all
trace
be
lost
perhaps
africans
were
officially
reported
as
brought
in
contrary
to
law
from
to
the
absurdity
of
this
figure
is
apparent
a
circular
letter
to
the
marshals
in
brought
reports
of
only
a
few
cases
like
that
of
the
general
ramirez
the
marshal
of
louisiana
had
no
information
there
appears
to
be
little
positive
evidence
of
a
large
illicit
importation
into
the
country
for
a
decade
after
it
is
hardly
possible
however
considering
the
activity
in
the
trade
that
slaves
were
not
largely
imported
indeed
when
we
note
how
the
laws
were
continually
broken
in
other
respects
absence
of
evidence
of
petty
smuggling
becomes
presumptive
evidence
that
collusive
or
tacit
understanding
of
officers
and
citizens
allowed
the
trade
to
some
extent
finally
it
must
be
noted
that
during
all
this
time
scarcely
a
man
suffered
for
participating
in
the
trade
beyond
the
loss
of
the
africans
and
more
rarely
of
his
ship
slavers
caught
in
the
act
and
convicted
were
too
often
like
la
coste
of
south
carolina
the
subjects
of
executive
clemency
in
certain
cases
there
were
those
who
even
had
the
effrontery
to
ask
congress
to
cancel
their
own
laws
for
instance
in
a
venezuelan
privateer
secretly
fitted
out
and
manned
by
americans
in
baltimore
succeeded
in
capturing
several
american
portuguese
and
spanish
slavers
and
appropriating
the
slaves
being
finally
wrecked
herself
she
transferred
her
crew
and
slaves
to
one
of
her
prizes
the
antelope
which
was
eventually
captured
by
a
united
states
cruiser
and
the
africans
sent
to
georgia
after
much
litigation
the
united
states
supreme
court
ordered
those
captured
from
spaniards
to
be
surrendered
and
the
others
to
be
returned
to
africa
by
some
mysterious
process
only
africans
now
remained
of
whom
were
sent
to
africa
the
spanish
claimants
of
the
remaining
sold
them
to
a
certain
wilde
who
gave
bond
to
transport
them
out
of
the
country
finally
in
december
there
came
an
innocent
petition
to
congress
to
this
a
bill
to
that
effect
passed
and
was
approved
may
and
in
consequence
these
africans
remained
as
slaves
in
georgia
on
the
whole
it
is
plain
that
although
in
the
period
from
to
congress
laid
down
broad
lines
of
legislation
sufficient
save
in
some
details
to
suppress
the
african
slave
trade
to
america
yet
the
execution
of
these
laws
was
criminally
lax
moreover
by
the
facility
with
which
slavers
could
disguise
their
identity
it
was
possible
for
them
to
escape
even
a
vigorous
enforcement
of
our
laws
this
situation
could
properly
be
met
only
by

no
mention

repugnant

may
an
additional
article
to
the
treaty
of

between

engaged
these
powers
to
endeavor
to
induce
the
approaching
congress
at
vienna
to
decree
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
so
that
the
said
trade
shall
cease
universally
as
it
shall
cease
definitively
under
any
circumstances
on
the
part
of
the
french
government
in
the
course
of
years
and
that
during
the
said
period
no
slave
merchant
shall
import
or
sell
slaves
except
in
the
colonies

the
state

which
he
is
a
subject
in
addition
to
this
the
next
day
a
circular
letter
was
despatched
by

to

expressing
the
hope
that
the
powers
of

when
restoring

to

with
one
common
interest
will
crown
this
great
work

its

that
while

however
to
secure
a
general
declaration
of
the

urging
if
not
compelling
the
abolition
of
the

in
as
well
as
the
attempt
to
secure

qualified

right

failed
although
both
propositions
were
strongly
urged
by
england
at
the

whatever
england
motives
were
it
is
certain
that
only
a
limited
international
right
of

on
the
high
seas
could
suppress

greatly
limit
the
her
diplomacy
was
therefore
henceforth
directed
to
this
end
on
the
other
hand
the
maritime
supremacy
of
england
so
successfully
asserted
during
the
napoleonic
wars
would
in
case
a

were
granted
virtually
make
england
the
policeman
of

if
nations
like
the

had
already
under

conditions
had
just
cause
to
complain
of
violations
by
england
of
their
rights
on
the

might
not
any
extension
of
rights
by
international
agreement
be
dangerous
it
was
such
considerations
that
for
many
years
brought
the
powers
to
a

their
efforts
to
suppress
the
at
first
it
looked
as
if
england
might
attempt
by
judicial
decisions
in
her
own
courts
to
seize
even
foreign
slavers
after
the
war
however
her
courts
disavowed
such
action
and
the
right
was
sought
for
by
treaty
stipulation
castlereagh
took
early
opportunity
to
approach
the
united
states
on
the
matter
suggesting
to
minister
rush
june
a
mutual
but
strictly
limited
right
of
search
rush
was
ordered
to
give
him
assurances
of
the
solicitude
of
the
united
states
to
suppress
the
traffic
but
to
state
that
the
concessions
asked
for
appeared
of
a
character
not
adaptable
to
our
institutions
negotiations
were
then
transferred
to
washington
and
the
new
british
minister
stratford
canning
approached
adams
with
full
instructions
in
december
meantime
it
had
become
clear
to
many
in
the
united
states
that
the
individual
efforts
of
states
could
never
suppress
or
even
limit
the
trade
without
systematic
in
a
committee
of
the
house
had
urged
the
opening
of
negotiations
looking
toward
such
international
and
a
senate
motion
to
the
same
effect
had
caused
long
debate
in
and
two
house
committee
reports
one
of
which
recommended
the
granting
of
a
right
of
search
were
adopted
by
the
house
but
failed
in
the
senate
adams
notwithstanding
this
saw
constitutional
objections
to
the
plan
proposed
by
canning
and
wrote
to
him
december
a
compact
giving
the
power
to
the
naval
officers
of
one
nation
to
search
the
merchant
vessels
of
another
for
offenders
and
offences
against
the
laws
of
the
latter
backed
by
a
further
power
to
seize
and

port

an
investment
of
power
over

reputation
of
the
citizens
of
this
country
not
only
unwarranted
by
any
delegation
of

so
adverse

elementary
principles

not

the
traffic
was
at
that

carried
on
to
a
greater
extent

ever
before

said
that

seven
months

no
less
than

were
abducted

three
hundred

of

it
is
obvious
said
they
that
this
crime
is
committed
in
contravention
of
the
laws
of
every
country
of
europe
and
of
america
excepting
only
of
one
and
that
it
requires
something
more
than
the
ordinary
operation
of
law
to
prevent
it
england
therefore
recommended
that
each
country
denounce
the
trade
as
piracy
with
a
view
of
founding
upon
the
aggregate
of
such
separate
declarations
a
general
law
to
be
incorporated
in
the
law
of
nations
a
withdrawing
of
the
flags
of
the
powers
from
persons
not
natives
of
these
states
who
engage
in
the
traffic
under
the
flags
of
these
states
a
refusal
to
admit
to
their
domains
the
produce
of
the
colonies
of
states
allowing
the
trade
a
measure
which
would
apply
to
portugal
and
brazil
alone
these
proposals
were
not
accepted
austria
would
agree
to
the
first
two
only
france
refused
to
denounce
the
trade
as
piracy
and
prussia
was
the
utmost
that
could
be
gained
was
another
denunciation
of
the
trade
couched
in
general
terms
of
england
did
not
however
lose
hope
of
gaining
some
concession
from
the
united
states
another
house
committee
had
in
reported
that
the
only
method
of
suppressing
the
trade
was
by
granting
a
right
of
search
the
house
agreed
february
to
request
the
president
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
the
maritime
powers
of
europe
to
denounce
the
as
piracy
an
amendment
that
we
agree
to
a
qualified
right
of
search
was
however
lost
meantime
the
english
minister
was
continually
pressing
the
matter
upon
adams
who
proposed
in
turn
to
denounce
the
trade
as
piracy
canning
agreed
to
this
but
only
on
condition
that
it
be
piracy
under
the
law
of
nations
and
not
merely
by
statute
law
such
an
agreement
he
said
would
involve
a
right
of
search
for
its
enforcement
he
proposed
strictly
to
limit
and
define
this
right
to
allow
captured
ships
to
be
tried
in
their
own
courts
and
not
to
commit
the
united
states
in
any
way
to
the
question
of
the
belligerent
right
of
search
adams
finally
sent
a
draft
of
a
proposed
treaty
to
england
and
agreed
to
recognize
the
as
piracy
under
the
law
of
nations
namely
that
although
seizable
by
the
officers
and
authorities
of
every
nation
they
should
be
triable
only
by
the
tribunals
of
the
country
of
the
slave
trading
vessel
rush
presented
this
to
the
government
in
january
england
agreed
to
all
the
points
insisted
on
by
the
united
states
that
she
herself
should
denounce
the
trade
as
piracy
that
slavers
should
be
tried
in
their
own
country
that
the
captor
should
be
laid
under
the
most
effective
responsibility
for
his
conduct
and
that
vessels
under
convoy
of
a
ship
of
war
of
their
own
country
should
be
exempt
from
search
in
addition
england
demanded
that
citizens
of
either
country
captured
under
the
flag
of
a
third
power
should
be
sent
home
for
trial
and
that
citizens
of
either
country
chartering
vessels
of
a
third
country
should
come
under
these
stipulations
this
convention
was
laid
before
the
senate
april
but
was
not
acted
upon
until
may
when
it
was
so
amended
as
to
make
it
terminable
at
six
months
notice
the
same
day
president
monroe
apprehending
from
the
delay
in
the
decision
that
some
difficulty
exists
sent
a
special
message
to
the
senate
giving
at
length
the
reasons
for
signing
the
treaty
and
saying
that
should
this
convention
be
adopted
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
be
the
commencement
of
a
system
destined
to
accomplish
the
entire
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
it
was
however
a
time
of
great
political
and
consequently
an
unfortunate
occasion
to
ask
senators
to
settle
any
great
question
a
systematic
attack
led
by
johnson
of
louisiana
was
made
on
all
the
vital
provisions
of
the
treaty
the
waters
of
america
were
excepted
from
its
application
and
those
of
the
west
indies
barely
escaped
exception
the
provision
which
perhaps
aimed
the
deadliest
blow
at
american
interests
was
likewise
struck
out
namely
the
application
of
the
right
of
search
to
citizens
chartering
the
vessels
of
a
third
nation
the
convention
thus
mutilated
was
not
signed
by
england
who
demanded
as
the
least
concession
the
application
of
the
right
of
search
to
american
waters
meantime
the
united
states
had
invited
nearly
all
nations
to
denounce
the
trade
as
piracy
and
the
president
the
secretary
of
the
navy
and
a
house
committee
had
urgently
favored
the
granting
of
the
right
of
search
the
bad
faith
of
congress
however
in
the
matter
of
the
colombian
treaty
broke
off
for
a
time
further
negotiations
with
england
attitude
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
the

the
right
of
search
was
established
between
england
and
sweden
and
in
brazil
promised
to
abolish
the
trade
in
three
years
in
the
cause
was
greatly
advanced
by
the
signing
of
a
treaty
between
great
britain
and
france
granting
mutually
a
geographically
limited
right
of
search
this
led
in
the
next
few
years
to
similar
treaties
with
denmark
sardinia
the
hanse
towns
and
naples
such
measures
put
the
trade
more
and
more
in
the
hands
of
americans
and
it
began
greatly
to
increase
mercer
sought
repeatedly
in
the
house
to
have
negotiations
reopened
with
england
but
without
success
indeed
the
chances
of
success
were
now
for
many
years
imperilled
by
the
recurrence
of
deliberate
search
of
american
vessels
by
the
british
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
vessels
proved
to
be
slavers
and
some
of
them
fraudulently
flew
the
american
flag
nevertheless
their
molestation
by
british
cruisers
created
much
feeling
and
hindered
all
steps
toward
an
understanding
the
united
states
was
loath
to
have
her
criminal
negligence
in
enforcing
her
own
laws
thus
exposed
by
foreigners
other
international
questions
connected
with
the
trade
also
strained
the
relations
of
the
two
countries
three
different
vessels
engaged
in
the
domestic
driven
by
stress
of
weather
or
in
the
creole
case
captured
by
negroes
on
board
landed
slaves
in
british
possessions
england
freed
them
and
refused
to
pay
for
such
as
were
landed
after
emancipation
had
been
proclaimed
in
the
west
indies
the
case
of
the
slaver
also
raised
difficulties
with
spain
this
spanish
vessel
after
the
negroes
on
board
had
mutinied
and
killed
their
owners
was
seized
by
a
united
states
vessel
and
brought
into
port
for
adjudication
the
court
however
freed
the
negroes
on
the
ground
that
under
spanish
law
they
were
not
legally
slaves
and
although
the
senate
repeatedly
tried
to
indemnify
the
owners
the
project
did
not
succeed
such
proceedings
well
illustrate
the
new
tendency
of
the
party
to
neglect
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
in
a
frantic
defence
of
the
remotest
ramparts
of
slave
property
consequently
when
after
the
treaty
of
france
and
england
joined
in
urging
the
accession
of
the
united
states
to
it
the
british
minister
was
at
last
compelled
to
inform
palmerston
december
that
the
executive
at
washington
appears
to
shrink
from
bringing
forward
in
any
shape
a
question
upon
which
depends
the
completion
of
their
former
object
the
utter
and
universal
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
from
an
apprehension
of
alarming
the
southern
states
great
britain
now
offered
to
sign
the
proposed
treaty
of
as
amended
but
even
this
forsyth
refused
and
stated
that
the
united
states
had
determined
not
to
become
a
party
of
any
convention
on
the
subject
of
the
slave
trade
estimates
as
to
the
extent
of
the
agree
that
the
traffic
to
north
and
south
america
in
was
considerable
certainly
not
much
less
than
slaves
annually
from
that
time
to
about
it
declined
somewhat
but
afterward
increased
enormously
so
that
by
the
american
importation
was
estimated
as
high
as
negroes
annually
the
total
abolition
of
the
african
trade
by
american
countries
then
brought
the
traffic
down
to
perhaps
in
a
large
and
rapid
increase
of
illicit
traffic
followed
so
that
by
the
importation
amounted
to
nearly
annually
one
province
of
brazil
is
said
to
have
received
in
the
years
in
the
decade
this
activity
in
continued
and
reached
very
large
proportions
the
traffic
thus
carried
on
floated
under
the
flags
of
france
spain
and
portugal
until
about
from
to
it
began
gradually
to
assume
the
united
states
flag
by
a
large
part
of
the
trade
was
under
the
stars
and
stripes
by
fully
the
trade
and
in
the
decade
nearly
all
the
traffic
found
this
flag
its
best
protection
quintuple
treaty
in
pope
gregory
xvi
stigmatized
the
as
utterly
unworthy
of
the
christian
name
and
at
the
same
time
although
proscribed
by
the
laws
of
every
civilized
state
the
trade
was
flourishing
with
pristine
vigor
great
advantage
was
given
the
traffic
by
the
fact
that
the
united
states
for
two
decades
after
the
abortive
attempt
of
refused
to
with
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
and
allowed
her
flag
to
shelter
and
protect
the
if
a
fully
equipped
slaver
sailed
from
new
york
havana
rio
janeiro
or
liverpool
she
had
only
to
hoist
the
stars
and
stripes
in
order
to
proceed
unmolested
on
her
piratical
voyage
for
there
was
seldom
a
united
states
cruiser
to
be
met
with
and
there
were
on
the
other
hand
diplomats
at
washington
so
jealous
of
the
honor
of
the
flag
that
they
would
prostitute
it
to
crime
rather
than
allow
an
english
or
a
french
cruiser
in
any
way
to
interfere
without
doubt
the
contention
of
the
united
states
as
to
england
pretensions
to
a
right
of
visit
was
technically
correct
nevertheless
it
was
clear
that
if
the
was
to
be
suppressed
each
nation
must
either
zealously
keep
her
flag
from
fraudulent
use
or
as
a
device
depute
to
others
this
duty
for
limited
places
and
under
special
circumstances
a
failure
of
any
one
nation
to
do
one
of
these
two
things
meant
that
the
efforts
of
all
other
nations
were
to
be
fruitless
the
united
states
had
invited
the
world
to
join
her
in
denouncing
the
as
piracy
yet
when
such
a
pirate
was
waylaid
by
an
english
vessel
the
united
states
complained
or
demanded
reparation
the
only
answer
which
this
country
for
years
returned
to
the
exposures
of
american
and
of
the
fraudulent
use
of
the
american
flag
was
a
recital
of
cases
where
great
britain
had
gone
beyond
her
legal
powers
in
her
attempt
to
suppress
the
in
the
face
of
overwhelming
evidence
to
the
contrary
secretary
of
state
forsyth
declared
in
that
the
duty
of
the
united
states
in
the
matter
of
the
has
been
faithfully
performed
and
if
the
traffic
still
exists
as
a
disgrace
to
humanity
it
is
to
be
imputed
to
nations
with
whom
her
government
has
formed
and
maintained
the
most
intimate
connexions
and
to
whose
governments
great
britain
has
paid
for
the
right
of
active
intervention
in
order
to
its
complete
extirpation
so
zealous
was
stevenson
our
minister
to
england
in
denying
the
right
of
search
that
he
boldly
informed
palmerston
in
that
there
is
no
shadow
of
pretence
for
excusing
much
less
justifying
the
exercise
of
any
such
right
that
it
is
wholly
immaterial
whether
the
vessels
be
equipped
for
or
actually
engaged
in
slave
traffic
or
not
and
consequently
the
right
to
search
or
detain
even
slave
vessels
must
be
confined
to
the
ships
or
vessels
of
those
nations
with
whom
it
may
have
treaties
on
the
subject
palmerston
courteously
replied
that
he
could
not
think
that
the
united
states
seriously
intended
to
make
its
flag
a
refuge
for
and
aberdeen
pertinently
declared
now
it
can
scarcely
be
maintained
by
stevenson
that
great
britain
should
be
bound
to
permit
her
own
subjects
with
british
vessels
and
british
capital
to
carry
on
before
the
eyes
of
british
officers
this
detestable
traffic
in
human
beings
which
the
law
has
declared
to
be
piracy
merely
because
they
had
the
audacity
to
commit
an
additional
offence
by
fraudulently
usurping
the
american
flag
thus
the
dispute
even
after
the
advent
of
webster
went
on
for
a
time
involving
itself
in
metaphysical
subtleties
and
apparently
leading
no
nearer
to
an
understanding
in
a
fourth
conference
of
the
powers
for
the
consideration
of
the
took
place
at
london
it
was
attended
by
representatives
of
england
france
russia
prussia
and
austria
england
laid
the
of
a
treaty
before
them
to
which
all
but
france
assented
this
quintuple
treaty
signed
december
denounced
the
as
piracy
and
declared
that
the
high
contracting
parties
agree
by
common
consent
that
those
of
their
ships
of
war
which
shall
be
provided
with
special
warrants
and
orders
may
search
every
belonging
to
any
one
of
the
high
contracting
parties
which
shall
on
reasonable
grounds
be
suspected
of
being
engaged
in
the
traffic
in
slaves
all
captured
slavers
were
to
be
sent
to
their
own
countries
for
trial
while
the
ratification
of
this
treaty
was
pending
the
united
states
minister
to
france
lewis
cass
addressed
an
official
note
to
guizot
at
the
french
foreign
office
protesting
against
the
institution
of
an
international
right
of
search
and
rather
grandiloquently
warning
the
powers
against
the
use
of
force
to
accomplish
their
ends
this
extraordinary
epistle
issued
on
the
minister
own
responsibility
brought
a
reply
denying
that
the
creation
of
any
new
principle
of
international
law
whereby
the
vessels
even
of
those
powers
which
have
not
participated
in
the
arrangement
should
be
subjected
to
the
right
of
search
was
ever
intended
and
affirming
that
no
such
extraordinary
interpretation
could
be
deduced
from
the
convention
moreover
guizot
hoped
that
the
united
states
by
agreeing
to
this
treaty
would
aid
by
its
most
sincere
endeavors
in
the
definitive
abolition
of
the
trade
cass
theatrical
protest
was
consciously
or
unconsciously
the
manifesto
of
that
growing
class
in
the
united
states
who
wanted
no
further
measures
taken
for
the
suppression
of
the
toward
that
as
toward
the
institution
of
slavery
this
party
favored
a
policy
of
strict
concerted
measures
the
treaty
of
washington
in
made
the
first
effective
compromise
in
the
matter
and
broke
the
unpleasant
by
substituting
joint
cruising
by
english
and
american
squadrons
for
the
proposed
grant
of
a
right
of
search
in
submitting
this
treaty
tyler
said
the
treaty
which
i
now
submit
to
you
proposes
no
alteration
mitigation
or
modification
of
the
rules
of
the
law
of
nations
it
provides
simply
that
each
of
the
two
governments
shall
maintain
on
the
coast
of
africa
a
sufficient
squadron
to
enforce
separately
and
respectively
the
laws
rights
and
obligations
of
the
two
countries
for
the
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
this
provision
was
a
part
of
the
treaty
to
settle
the
boundary
disputes
with
england
in
the
senate
benton
moved
to
strike
out
this
article
but
the
attempt
was
defeated
by
a
vote
of
to
and
the
treaty
was
ratified
this
stipulation
of
the
treaty
of
was
never
properly
carried
out
by
the
united
states
for
any
length
of
time
consequently
the
same
difficulties
as
to
search
and
visit
by
english
vessels
continued
to
recur
cases
like
the
following
were
frequent
the
illinois
of
gloucester
massachusetts
while
lying
at
whydah
africa
was
boarded
by
a
british
officer
but
having
american
papers
was
unmolested
three
days
later
she
hoisted
spanish
colors
and
sailed
away
with
a
cargo
of
slaves
next
morning
she
fell
in
with
another
british
vessel
and
hoisted
american
colors
the
british
ship
had
then
no
right
to
molest
her
but
the
captain
of
the
slaver
feared
that
she
would
and
therefore
ran
his
vessel
aground
slaves
and
all
the
senior
english
officer
reported
that
had
lieutenant
cumberland
brought
to
and
boarded
the
notwithstanding
the
american
colors
which
she
hoisted
the
american
master
of
the
would
have
complained
to
his
government
of
the
detention
of
his
vessel
again
a
vessel
which
had
been
boarded
by
british
officers
and
found
with
american
flag
and
papers
was
a
little
later
captured
under
the
spanish
flag
with
four
hundred
and
thirty
slaves
she
had
in
the
interim
complained
to
the
united
states
government
of
the
boarding
meanwhile
england
continued
to
urge
the
granting
of
a
right
of
search
claiming
that
the
stand
of
the
united
states
really
amounted
to
the
wholesale
protection
of
pirates
under
her
flag
the
united
states
answered
by
alleging
that
even
the
treaty
of
had
been
misconstrued
by
england
whereupon
there
was
much
warm
debate
in
congress
and
several
attempts
were
made
to
abrogate
the
article
of
the
treaty
the
party
had
become
more
and
more
suspicious
of

motives
since
they
had
seen
her
abolition
of
the
blossom
into
abolition
of
the
system
itself
and
they
seized
every
opportunity
to
prevent
with
her
at
the
same
time
european
interest
in
the
question
showed
some
signs
of
weakening
and
no
decided
action
was
taken

changed
her
right
of
search
stipulations
of
to
one
for

while
the

and

enounced
the
trade
as

in

granted
the
right

and
in
belgium
signed
the
quintuple
treaty
discussion
between
england
and
the
united
states
was
revived
when
cass
held
the
state
portfolio
and
strange
to
say
the
author
of
protest
went
farther
than
any
of
his
predecessors
in
acknowledging
the
justice
of
england
demands
said
he
in
if
the
united
states
maintained
that
by
carrying
their
flag
at
her
masthead
any
vessel
became
thereby
entitled
to
the
immunity
which
belongs
to
american
vessels
they
might
well
be
reproached
with
assuming
a
position
which
would
go
far
towards
shielding
crimes
upon
the
ocean
from
punishment
but
they
advance
no
such
pretension
while
they
concede
that
if
in
the
honest
examination
of
a
vessel
sailing
under
american
colours
but
accompanied
by
suspicious
circumstances
a
mistake
is
made
and
she
is
found
to
be
entitled
to
the
flag
she
bears
but
no
injury
is
committed
and
the
conduct
of
the
boarding
party
is
irreproachable
no
government
would
be
likely
to
make
a
case
thus
exceptional
in
its
character
a
subject
of
serious
reclamation
while
admitting
this
and
expressing
a
desire
to
in
the
suppression
of
the
cass
nevertheless
steadily
refused
all
further
overtures
toward
a
mutual
right
of
search
the
increase
of
the
was
so
great
in
the
decade
that
lord
john
russell
proposed
to
the
governments
of
the
united
states
france
spain
portugal
and
brazil
that
they
instruct
their
ministers
to
meet
at
london
in
may
or
june
to
consider
measures
for
the
final
abolition
of
the
trade
he
stated
it
is
ascertained
by
repeated
instances
that
the
practice
is
for
vessels
to
sail
under
the
american
flag
if
the
flag
is
rightly
assumed
and
the
papers
correct
no
british
cruizer
can
touch
them
if
no
slaves
are
on
board
even
though
the
equipment
the
fittings

and
other
circumstances
prove
that
the

no

continued
representations
of
this
kind
were
made
to
the
paralyzed

government
indeed
the
of
the
world
seemed
now
to
float
securely
under
her
flag
nevertheless

refused
even
to

in

proposed

refused
to

read
in
the
light
of
the
industrial
revolution
through
which
the
civilized
world
passed
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
between
the
years
and
occurred
economic
events
and
changes
of
the
highest
importance
and
widest
influence
though
all
branches
of
industry
felt
the
impulse
of
this
new
industrial
life
yet
if
we
consider
single
industries
cotton
manufacture
has
during
the
nineteenth
century
made
the
most
magnificent
and
gigantic
advances
this
fact
is
easily
explained
by
the
remarkable
series
of
inventions
that
revolutionized
this
industry
between
and
including
arkwright
watt
compton
and
cartwright
contrivances
the
effect
which
these
inventions
had
on
the
manufacture
of
cotton
goods
is
best
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
in
england
the
chief
cotton
market
of
the
world
the
consumption
of
raw
cotton
rose
steadily
from
bales
in
to
in
to
in
and
to
in
very
early
therefore
came
the
query
whence
the
supply
of
raw
cotton
was
to
come
tentative
experiments
on
the
rich
broad
fields
of
the
southern
united
states
together
with
the
indispensable
invention
of
soon
answered
this
question
a
new
economic
future
was
opened
up
to
this
land
and
immediately
the
whole
south
began
to
extend
its
cotton
culture
and
more
and
more
to
throw
its
whole
energy
into
this
one
staple
here
it
was
that
the
fatal
mistake
of
compromising
with
slavery
in
the
beginning
and
of
the
policy
of
pursued
thereafter
became
painfully
manifest
for
instead
now
of
a
healthy
normal
economic
development
along
proper
industrial
lines
we
have
the
abnormal
and
fatal
rise
of
a
large
farming
system
which
before
it
was
realized
had
so
intertwined
itself
with
and
braced
itself
upon
the
economic
forces
of
an
industrial
age
that
a
vast
and
terrible
civil
war
was
necessary
to
displace
it
the
tendencies
to
a
patriarchal
serfdom
recognizable
in
the
age
of
washington
and
jefferson
began
slowly
but
surely
to
disappear
and
in
the
second
quarter
of
the
century
southern
slavery
was
irresistibly
changing
from
a
family
institution
to
an
industrial
system
the
development
of
southern
slavery
has
heretofore
been
viewed
so
exclusively
from
the
ethical
and
social
standpoint
that
we
are
apt
to
forget
its
close
and
indissoluble
connection
with
the
world
cotton
market
beginning
with
a
little
after
the
close
of
the
napoleonic
wars
when
the
industry
of
cotton
manufacture
had
begun
its
modern
development
and
the
south
had
definitely
assumed
her
position
as
chief
producer
of
raw
cotton
we
find
the
average
price
of
cotton
per
pound
from
this
time
until
the
price
steadily
fell
until
in
the
latter
year
it
reached
the
only
exception
to
this
fall
was
in
the
years
when
among
other
things
a
strong
increase
in
the
english
demand
together
with
an
attempt
of
the
young
slave
power
to
corner
the
market
sent
the
price
up
as
high
as
the
demand
for
cotton
goods
soon
outran
a
crop
which
mccullough
had
pronounced
prodigious
and
after
the
price
started
on
a
steady
rise
which
except
for
the
checks
suffered
during
the
continental
revolutions
and
the
crimean
war
continued
until
the
steady
increase
in
the
production
of
cotton
explains
the
fall
in
price
down
to
in
the
crop
was
a
bales
in
a
million
in
a
million
and
a
half
and
in
two
million
by
this
time
the
world
consumption
of
cotton
goods
began
to
increase
so
rapidly
that
in
spite
of
the
increase
in
southern
crops
the
price
kept
rising
three
million
bales
were
gathered
in
three
and
a
half
million
in
and
the
remarkable
crop
of
five
million
bales
in
here
we
have
data
to
explain
largely
the
economic
development
of
the
south
by
the
slave
system
had
gained
footing
in
it
was
able
to
show
its
power
in
the
cotton
corner
by
the
end
of
the
next
decade
it
had
not
only
gained
a
solid
economic
foundation
but
it
had
built
a
closed
oligarchy
with
a
political
policy
the
changes
in
price
during
the
next
few
years
drove
out
of
competition
many
survivors
of
the
system
and
put
the
slave
in
position
to
dictate
the
policy
of
the
nation
the
zenith
of
the
system
and
the
first
inevitable
signs
of
decay
came
in
the
years
when
the
rising
price
of
cotton
threw
the
whole
economic
energy
of
the
south
into
its
cultivation
leading
to
a
terrible
consumption
of
soil
and
slaves
to
a
great
increase
in
the
size
of
plantations
and
to
increasing
power
and
effrontery
on
the
part
of
the
slave
barons
finally
when
a
rising
moral
crusade
conjoined
with
threatened
economic
disaster
the
oligarchy
encouraged
by
the
state
of
the
cotton
market
risked
all
on
a
political
which
failed
in
the
war

the

of
the
south
toward
the
changed
with
this

of
the
cotton
trade
from
to
the
south
half
wished
to
get
rid
of
a
troublesome
and
abnormal
institution
and
yet
saw
no
way
to
do
so
the
fear
of
insurrection
and
of
the
further
spread
of
the
disagreeable
system
led
her
to
consent
to
the
partial
prohibition
of
the
trade
by
severe
national
enactments
nevertheless
she
had
in
the
matter
no
settled
policy
she
refused
to
support
vigorously
the
execution
of
the
laws
she
had
helped
to
make
and
at
the
same
time
she
acknowledged
the
theoretical
necessity
of
these
laws
after
however
there
came
a
gradual
change
the
south
found
herself
supplied
with
a
body
of
slave
laborers
whose
number
had
been
augmented
by
large
illicit
importations
with
an
abundance
of
rich
land
and
with
all
other
natural
facilities
for
raising
a
crop
which
was
in
large
demand
and
peculiarly
adapted
to
slave
labor
the
increasing
crop
caused
a
new
demand
for
slaves
and
an
interstate
arose
between
the
border
and
the
gulf
states
which
turned
the
former
into
districts
and
bound
them
to
the
slave
states
by
ties
of
strong
economic
interest
as
the
cotton
crop
continued
to
increase
this
source
of
supply
became
inadequate
especially
as
the
theory
of
land
and
slave
consumption
broke
down
former
ethical
and
prudential
bounds
it
was
for
example
found
cheaper
to
work
a
slave
to
death
in
a
few
years
and
buy
a
new
one
than
to
care
for
him
in
sickness
and
old
age
so
too
it
was
easier
to
despoil
rich
new
land
in
a
few
years
of
intensive
culture
and
move
on
to
the
southwest
than
to
fertilize
and
conserve
the
soil
consequently
there
early
came
a
demand
for
land
and
slaves
greater
than
the
country
could
supply
the
demand
for
land
showed
itself
in
the
annexation
of
texas
the
conquest
of
mexico
and
the
movement
toward
the
acquisition
of
cuba
the
demand
for
slaves
was
manifested
in
the
illicit
traffic
that
noticeably
increased
about
and
reached
large
proportions
by
it
was
also
seen
in
a
disposition
to
attack
the
government
for
stigmatizing
the
trade
as
criminal
then
in
a
disinclination
to
take
any
measures
which
would
have
rendered
our
repressive
laws
effective
and
finally
in
such
articulate
declarations
by
prominent
men
as
this
experience
having
settled
the
point
that
this
trade
be
abolished
by
the
use
of
and
that
blockading
squadrons
serve
only
to
make
it
more
profitable
and
more
cruel
i
am
surprised
that
the
attempt
is
persisted
in
unless
as
it
serves
as
a
cloak
to
some
other
purposes
it
would
be
far
better
than
it
now
is
for
the
african
if
the
trade
was
free
from
all
restrictions
and
left
to
the
mitigation
and
decay
which
time
and
competition
would
surely
bring
about
attitude
of
the
north
and
with
the
north
as
yet
unawakened
to
the
great
changes
taking
place
in
the
south
and
with
the
attitude
of
the
south
thus
in
process
of
development
little
or
no
constructive
legislation
could
be
expected
on
the
subject
of
the
as
the
divergence
in
sentiment
became
more
and
more
pronounced
there
were
various
attempts
at
legislation
all
of
which
proved
abortive
the
party
attempted
as
early
as
and
again
in
to
abolish
the
african
agency
and
leave
the
africans
practically
at
the
mercy
of
the
states
one
or
two
attempts
were
made
to
relax
the
few
provisions
which
restrained
the
coastwise
trade
and
after
the
treaty
of
benton
proposed
to
stop
appropriations
for
the
african
squadron
until
england
defined
her
position
on
the
right
of
search
question
the
men
presented
several
bills
to
amend
and
strengthen
previous
laws
they
sought
for
instance
in
vain
to
regulate
the
texan
trade
through
which
numbers
of
slaves
indirectly
reached
the
united
states
presidents
and
consuls
earnestly
recommended
legislation
to
restrict
the
clearances
of
vessels
bound
on
voyages
and
to
hinder
the
facility
with
which
slavers
obtained
fraudulent
papers
only
one
such
bill
succeeded
in
passing
the
senate
and
that
was
dropped
in
the
house
the
only
legislation
of
this
period
was
confined
to
a
few
appropriation
bills
only
one
of
these
acts
that
of
appropriating
was
designed
materially
to
aid
in
the
suppression
of
the
trade
all
the
others
relating
to
expenses
incurred
after
violations
after
the
appropriations
dwindled
being
made
at
intervals
of
one
two
and
three
years
down
to
when
the
amount
was
no
further
appropriations
were
made
until
when
a
few
thousands
above
an
unexpended
surplus
were
appropriated
in
were
given
and
finally
in
were
secured
but
this
was
the
last
sum
obtainable
until
nearly
all
of
these
meagre
appropriations
went
toward
reimbursing
southern
plantation
owners
for
the
care
and
support
of
illegally
imported
africans
and
the
rest
to
the
maintenance
of
the
african
agency
suspiciously
large
sums
were
paid
for
the
first
purpose
considering
the
fact
that
such
africans
were
always
worked
hard
by
those
to
whom
they
were
farmed
out
and
often
disappeared
while
in
their
hands
in
the
accounts
we
nevertheless
find
many
items
like
that
of
for
the
maintenance
of
negroes
imported
on
the
ramirez
in
for
the
bounty
subsistence
clothing
medicine
of
fifteen
africans
in
for
the
support
of
slaves
for
two
months
including
a
bill
of
for
medical
attendance
the
african
agency
suffered
many
vicissitudes
the
first
agent
bacon
who
set
out
early
in
was
authorized
by
president
monroe
to
form
an
establishment
on
the
island
of
sherbro
or
elsewhere
on
the
coast
of
africa
and
to
build
barracks
for
three
hundred
persons
he
was
however
warned
not
to
connect
your
agency
with
the
views
or
plans
of
the
colonization
society
with
which
under
the
law
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
no
concern
bacon
soon
died
and
was
followed
during
the
next
four
years
by
winn
and
ayres
they
succeeded
in
establishing
a
government
agency
on
cape
mesurado
in
conjunction
with
that
of
the
colonization
society
the
agent
of
that
society
jehudi
ashmun
became
after
the
virtual
head
of
the
colony
he
fortified
and
enlarged
it
and
laid
the
foundations
of
an
independent
community
the
succeeding
government
agents
came
to
be
merely
official
representatives
of
the
united
states
and
the
distribution
of
free
rations
for
liberated
africans
ceased
in
between
and
two
hundred
and
recaptured
africans
were
sent
to
the
agency
and
were
expended
the
property
of
the
government
at
the
agency
was
valued
at
from
to
nearly
more
were
expended
chiefly
for
the
agents
salaries
about
the
appointment
of
an
agent
ceased
and
the
colony
became
gradually
and
independent
it
was
proclaimed
as
the
republic
of
liberia
in
application
of
the
in
reviewing
efforts
toward
the
suppression
of
the
from
to
it
must
be
remembered
that
nearly
every
cabinet
had
a
strong
if
not
a
predominating
southern
element
and
that
consequently
the
efforts
of
the
executive
were
powerfully
influenced
by
the
changing
attitude
of
the
south
naturally
under
such
circumstances
the
government
displayed
little
activity
and
no
enthusiasm
in
the
work
in
a
single
vessel
of
the
gulf
squadron
was
occasionally
sent
to
the
african
coast
to
return
by
the
route
usually
followed
by
the
slavers
no
wonder
that
none
of
these
or
any
other
of
our
public
ships
have
found
vessels
engaged
in
the
slave
trade
under
the
flag
of
the
united
states
although
it
is
known
that
the
trade
still
exists
to
a
most
lamentable
extent
indeed
all
that
an
american
slaver
need
do
was
to
run
up
a
spanish
or
a
portuguese
flag
to
be
absolutely
secure
from
all
attack
or
inquiry
on
the
part
of
united
states
vessels
even
this
desultory
method
of
suppression
was
not
regular
in
no
vessel
has
been
despatched
to
the
coast
of
africa
for
several
months
and
from
that
time
until
this
country
probably
had
no
police
upon
the
seas
except
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
increasing
violations
led
to
the
sending
of
two
vessels
to
the
african
coast
and
these
were
kept
there
more
or
less
regularly
but
even
after
the
signing
of
the
treaty
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
reports
on
the
coast
of
africa
we
have
squadron
the
small
appropriation
of
the
present
year
was
believed
to
be
scarcely
sufficient
between
and
the
coast
squadron
varied
from
two
to
six
vessels
with
from
thirty
to
guns
but
the
force
habitually
and
actively
engaged
in
cruizing
on
the
ground
frequented
by
slavers
has
probably
been
less
by
if
we
consider
the
size
of
the
ships
employed
and
their
withdrawal
for
purposes
of
recreation
and
health
and
the
movement
of
the
reliefs
whose
arrival
does
not
correspond
exactly
with
the
departure
of
the
vessels
whose
term
of
service
has
expired
the
reports
of
the
navy
show
that
in
only
four
of
the
eight
years
mentioned
was
the
fleet
at
the
time
of
report
at
the
stipulated
size
of
eighty
guns
and
at
times
it
was
much
below
this
even
as
late
as
when
only
two
vessels
are
reported
on
duty
along
the
african
coast
as
the
commanders
themselves
acknowledged
the
squadron
was
too
small
and
the
too
large
to
make
joint
cruising
effective
the
same
story
comes
from
the
brazil
station
nothing
effectual
can
be
done
towards
stopping
the
slave
trade
as
our
squadron
is
at
present
organized
wrote
the
consul
at
rio
janeiro
in
when
it
is
considered
that
the
brazil
station
extends
from
north
of
the
equator
to
cape
horn
on
this
continent
and
includes
a
great
part
of
africa
south
of
the
equator
on
both
sides
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
it
must
be
admitted
that
one
frigate
and
one
brig
is
a
very
insufficient
force
to
protect
american
commerce
and
repress
the
participation
in
the
slave
trade
by
our
own
vessels
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
cruisers
were
stationed
most
of
the
time
although
even
here
there
were
at
times
urgent
representations
that
the
scarcity
or
the
absence
of
such
vessels
gave
the
illicit
trade
great
license
owing
to
this
general
negligence
of
the
government
and
also
to
its
anxiety
on
the
subject
of
the
theoretic
right
of
search
many
officials
were
kept
in
a
state
of
chronic
deception
in
regard
to
the
trade
the
enthusiasm
of
commanders
was
dampened
by
the
lack
of
latitude
allowed
and
by
the
repeated
insistence
in
their
orders
on
the
of
a
right
of
search
when
one
commander
realizing
that
he
could
not
cover
the
with
his
fleet
requested
english
commanders
to
detain
suspicious
american
vessels
until
one
of
his
vessels
came
up
the
government
annulled
the
agreement
as
soon
as
it
reached
their
ears
rebuked
him
and
the
matter
was
alluded
to
in
congress
long
after
with
horror
according
to
the
orders
of
cruisers
only
slavers
with
slaves
actually
on
board
could
be
seized
consequently
fully
equipped
slavers

all
preparations

greatly
to
be

that
this

great
a

nullify
our
endeavours
of

spirit
hostile
to

of
doubt
when
the

usually
in

the

was
proven
to
have
consciously

unconsciously
aided

by

the

curious

persons
in

were

suspected

which
was

to
lie
in

harbor
of
charleston
south

and
refit
was
afterwards
captured
with
two
hundred
and
slaves
on
board
the
real
reason
that
prevented
many
belligerent
congressmen
from
pressing
certain
search
claims
against
england
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
unjustifiable
detentions
had
unfortunately
revealed
so
much
american
guilt
that
it
was
deemed
wiser
to
let
the
matter
end
in
talk
for
instance
in
congress
demanded
information
as
to
illegal
searches
and
president
fillmore
report
showed
the
uncomfortable
fact
that
of
the
ten
american
ships
wrongly
detained
by
english
nine
were
proven
slavers
the
consul
at
havana
reported
in
that
whole
cargoes
of
slaves
fresh
from
africa
were
being
daily
shipped
to
texas
in
american
vessels
that
had
been
sent
within
a
few
months
that
the
rate
was
increasing
and
that
many
of
these
slaves
can
scarcely
fail
to
find
their
way
into
the
united
states
moreover
the
consul
acknowledged
that
ships
frequently
cleared
for
the
united
states
in
ballast
taking
on
a
cargo
at
some
secret
point
when
with
these
facts
we
consider
the
law
facilitating
recovery
of
slaves
from
texas
the
repeated
refusals
to
regulate
the
texan
trade
and
the
shelving
of
a
proposed
congressional
investigation
into

matters
conjecture
becomes
a

certainty
it

africans
were

that

can

that

only
the

labor
from
sinking
to
this
level
and
when
a
community
has
once
been
debauched
by
slavery
its
moral
sense
offers
little
resistance
to
economic
demand

the

even
here
the
ethical
standard
of
the
south
was
not

to
maintain
itself
against
the
demands
of
the
cotton
industry
when
after
the
price
of
slaves
had
risen
to
a
monopoly
height
the
leaders
of
the
plantation
system
brought
to
the
edge
of
bankruptcy
by
the
crude
and
reckless
farming
necessary
under
a
slave
and
baffled
at
least
temporarily
in
their
quest
of

began
instinctively
to
feel
that
the
only

of
american

lay
in
the
reopening
of
the
african
it
took
but
a
spark
to
put
this
instinctive
feeling
into
words
and
words
led
to
deeds
the
movement
first
took
definite
form
in
the
ever
radical
state
of
south
carolina
in
a
grand
jury
in
the
williamsburg
district
declared
as
our
unanimous
opinion
that
the
federal
law
abolishing
the
african
slave
trade
is
a
public
grievance
we
hold
this
trade
has
been
and
would
be
if
a
blessing
to
the
american
people
and
a
benefit
to
the
african
himself
this
attracted
only
local
attention
but
when
in
the
governor
of
the
state
in
his
annual
message
calmly
argued
at
length
for
a
reopening
of
the
trade
and
boldly
declared
that
if
we
can
not
supply
the
demand
for
slave
labor
then
we
must
expect
to
be
supplied
with
a
species
of
labor
we
do
not
want
such
words
struck
even
southern
ears
like
a
thunder
clap
in
a
calm
day
and
yet
it
needed
but
a
few
years
to
show
that
south
carolina
had
merely
been
the
first
to
put
into

inarticulate
thought

of
the
growth

followed

annual
gathering
which
seems
to
have
been
fairly
representative

considerable
part

opinion

resolution

to

in

day
said
there
were
introduced
into

two
leading
measures

the
laying
of
a

tariff
on
northern
goods

the
reopening
of
the
the
one
to
advance
our
commercial
interest
the
other
our
agricultural
interest

which
when
taken
together

they
were

intended
to
be
and

they
have

been

submitted

the
champion
presented
an
elaborate
majority
report
from
the
committee
and
recommended
the
following
resolutions
that
slavery
is
right
and
that
being
right
there
can
be
no
wrong
in
the
natural
means
to
its
formation
that
it
is
expedient
and
proper
that

that

that

that

yancey
from
the

committee
presented
a
minority
report
which
though
it
demanded
the
repeal
of
the
national
prohibitory
laws
did
not
advocate
the
reopening
of
the

by
the
states
much
debate
ensued
pryor
of

declared
the

report
a
proposition
to

yancey
declared
that
he
was
for
disunion
now
applause
he
defended
the
principle
of
the
and
said
if
it
is
right
to
buy
slaves
in
virginia
and
carry
them
to
new
orleans
why
is
it
not
right
to
buy
them
in

brazil
or
africa
and
carry
them
there
the
opposing
speeches
made
little
attempt
to
meet
this
uncomfortable
logic
but
nevertheless
opposition
enough
was
developed
to
lay
the
report
on
the
table
until
the
next
convention
with
orders
that
it
be
printed
in
the
mean
time
as
a
radical
campaign
document
finally
the

passed
a
resolution
that

convention
of

of
met
at
vicksburg
mississippi
may
and
the
party
came
ready
for
a
fray
on
the
second
day
spratt
called
up
his
resolutions
and
the
next
day
the
committee
on
resolutions
recommended
that
in
the
opinion
of
this
convention
all
laws
state
or
federal
prohibiting
the
african
slave
trade
ought
to
be
repealed
two
minority
reports
accompanied
this
resolution
one
proposed
to
postpone
action
on
account
of
the
futility
of
the
attempt
at
that
time
the
other
report
recommended
that
since
repeal
of
the
national
laws
was
improbable
nullification
by
the
states
impracticable
and
action
by
the
supreme
court
unlikely
therefore
the
states
should
bring
in
the
africans
as
apprentices
a
system
the
legality
of
which
is
incontrovertible
the
only
difficult
question
it
was
said
is
the
future
status
of
the
apprentices
after
the
expiration
of
their
term
of
servitude
debate
on
these
propositions
began
in
the
afternoon
a
brilliant
speech
on
the
resumption
of
the
importation
of
slaves
says
foote
of
mississippi
was
listened
to
with
breathless
attention
and
applauded
vociferously
those
of
us
who
rose
in
opposition
were
looked
upon
by
the
excited
assemblage
present
as
to
the
best
interests
of
the
south
and
only
worthy
of
expulsion
from
the
body
the
excitement
at
last
grew
so
high
that
personal
violence
was
menaced
and
some
dozen
of
the
more
conservative
members
of
the
convention
withdrew
from
the
hall
in
which
it
was
holding
its
sittings
it
was
clear
adds
de
bow
that
the
people
of
vicksburg
looked
upon
it
the
convention
with
some
distrust
when
at
last
a
ballot
was
taken
the
first
resolution
passed
by
a
vote
of
to
finally
the
article
of
the
treaty
of
washington
was
again
condemned
and
it
was
also
suggested
in
the
newspaper
which
was
the
official
organ
of
the
meeting
that
the
convention
raise
a
fund
to
be
dispensed
in
premiums
for
the
best
sermons
in
favor
of
reopening
the
african
slave
trade
opinion
in
the
this
record
of
the
commercial
conventions
probably
gives
a
true
reflection
of
the
development
of
extreme
opinion
on
the
question
of
reopening
the
first
it
is
noticeable
that
on
this
point
there
was
a
distinct
divergence
of
opinion
and
interest
between
the
gulf
and
the
border
states
and
it
was
this
more
than
any
moral
repugnance
that
checked
the
radicals
the
whole
movement
represented
the
economic
revolt
of
the
against
their
base
of
labor
supply
this
revolt
was
only
prevented
from
gaining
its
ultimate
end
by
the
fact
that
the
gulf
states
could
not
get
on
without
the
active
political
of
the
border
states
thus
although
such
as
spratt
were
not
able
even
as
late
as
to
carry
a
substantial
majority
of
the
south
with
them
in
an
attempt
to
reopen
the
trade
at
all
hazards
yet
the
agitation
did
succeed
in
sweeping
away
nearly
all
theoretical
opposition
to
the
trade
and
left
the
majority
of
southern
people
in
an
attitude
which
regarded
the
reopening
of
the
african
as
merely
a
question
of
expediency
this
growth
of
southern
opinion
is
clearly
to
be
followed
in
the
newspapers
and
pamphlets
of
the
day
in
congress
and
in
many
significant
movements
the
charleston
in
a
series
of
articles
strongly
advocated
the
reopening
of
the
trade
the
richmond
though
opposing
the
scheme
as
a
virginia
paper
should
was
brought
to
acknowledge
that
the
laws
which
condemn
the
imply
an
aspersion
upon
the
character
of
the
south
in
march
the
said
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
idea
of
reviving
the
african
slave
trade
is
gaining
ground
in
the
south
some
two
months
ago
we
could
quote
strong
articles
from
ultra
southern
journals
against
the
traffic
but
of
late
we
have
been
sorry
to
observe
in
the
same
journals
an
ominous
silence
upon
the
subject
while
the
advocates
of
trade
in
negroes
are
earnest
and
active
the
savannah
which
at
first
declared
the
movement
to
be
of
no
serious
intent
conceded
in
that
it
was
gaining
favor
and
that
of
the
democratic
congressional
convention
favored
it
and
that
even
those
who
did
not
advocate
a
revival
demanded
the
abolition
of
the
laws
a
correspondent
from
south
carolina
writes
december
the
nefarious
project
of
opening
it
the
slave
trade
has
been
started
here
in
that
prurient
temper
of
the
times
which
manifests
itself
in
disunion
schemes
my
state
is
strangely
and
terribly
infected
with
all
this
sort
of
thing
one
feeling
that
gives
a
countenance
to
the
opening
of
the
slave
trade
is
that
it
will
be
a
sort
of
spite
to
the
north
and
defiance
of
their
opinions
the
new
orleans
declared
that
those
who
voted
for
the

were
men
whose
names
will
be
honored
hereafter
for
the
unflinching
manner
in
which
they
stood
up
for
principle
for
truth
and
consistency
as
well
as
the
vital
interests
of
the
south
question
in
early
in
december
the
subject
reached
congress
and
although
the
agitation
was
then
new
southern
congressmen
refused
to
declare
a
of
the
shocking
to
the
moral
sentiment
of
the
enlightened
portion
of

you
may
not

my
conclusion
he
opposed

for
fear

carefully
added
this
conclusion
in

based
upon
my
view

from

more

came
others

the

on

finally
brought
a
request
to
the

port
at
charleston
south
carolina
from
lafitte
for
a
clearance
to

for
the

appealed
to

howell

of
georgia
who
flatly
refused
to
take
the
bait
and
replied
that
if

were
brought
in
as
slaves
it
would
be
contrary
to
united
states
law
if
as
freemen
it
would
be
contrary
to
their
own
state
law
in
louisiana
a
still
more
radical
movement
was
attempted
and
a

passed

house
of
representatives
authorizing
a
company
to
import
two
thousand
five
hundred
africans
indentured
for
fifteen
years
at

the

lacked
but
two
votes
of
passing

that

of

agricultural
society
which
unanimously
resolved
to
offer
a
premium
of
for
the
best
specimen
of
a
live
african
imported
into
the
united
states
within
the
last
twelve
months
it
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
there
was
in
the
south
in
substantial
unanimity
on
the
subject
of
reopening
the
nevertheless
there
certainly
was
a
large
and
influential
minority
including
perhaps
a
majority
of
citizens
of
the

states
who
favored
the
project
and
in
defiance
of

and
morals
aided
and
abetted
its
actual
realization
various
movements
it
must
be
remembered
gained
much
of
their
strength
from
the
fact
that
their
success
meant
a
partial
nullification
of
the
laws
the
admission
of
texas
added
probably
thousand
recently
imported
slaves
to
the
southern
stock
the
movement
against
cuba
which
culminated
in
the
ostend
manifesto
of
buchanan
mason
and
soulé
had
its
chief
impetus
in
the
thousands
of
slaves
whom
americans
had
poured
into
the
island
finally
the
series
of
filibustering
expeditions
against
cuba
mexico
and
central
america
were
but
the
wilder
and
more
irresponsible
attempts
to
secure
both
slave
territory
and
slaves
of
the
from
to
the
long
and
open
agitation
for
the
reopening
of
the
together
with
the
fact
that
the
south
had
been
more
or
less
familiar
with
violations
of
the
laws
since
led
to
such
a
remarkable
increase
of
illicit
traffic
and
actual
importations
in
the
decade
that
the
movement
may
almost
be
termed
a
reopening
of

the
foreign
our
own
officers
continue
to
report
how
shamefully
our
flag
has
been
used
and
british
officers
write
that
at
least
one
half
of
the
successful
part
of
the
slave
trade
is
carried
on
under
the
american
flag
and
this
because
the
number
of
american
cruisers
on
the
station
is
so
small
in
proportion
to
the
immense
extent
of
the
coast
the
fitting
out
of
slavers
became
a
flourishing
business
in
the
united
states
and
centred
at
new
york
city
few
of
our
readers
writes
a
periodical
of
the
day
are
aware
of
the
extent
to
which
this
infernal
traffic
is
carried
on
by
vessels
clearing
from
new
york
and
in
close
alliance
with
our
legitimate
trade
and
that
merchants
of
wealth
and
respectability
are
extensively
engaged
in
buying
and
selling
african
negroes
and
have
been
with
comparatively
little
interruption
for
an
indefinite
number
of
years
another
periodical
says
the
number
of
persons
engaged
in
the
and
the
amount
of
capital
embarked
in
it
exceed
our
powers
of
calculation
the
city
of
new
york
has
been
until
of
late
the
principal
port
of
the
world
for
this
infamous
commerce
although
the
cities
of
portland
and
boston
are
only
second
to
her
in
that
distinction
slave
dealers
added
largely
to
the
wealth
of
our
commercial
metropolis
they
contributed
liberally
to
the
treasuries
of
political
organizations
and
their
bank
accounts
were
largely
depleted
to
carry
elections
in
new
jersey
pennsylvania
and
connecticut
during
eighteen
months
of
the
years
slavers
are
reported
to
have
been
fitted
out
in
new
york
harbor
and
these
alone
transported
from
to
slaves
annually
the
united

deputy
marshal
of
that
district
declared
in
that
the
business
of
fitting
out
slavers
was
never
prosecuted
with
greater
energy
than
at
present
the
occasional
interposition
of
the
legal
authorities
exercises
no
apparent
influence
for
its
suppression
it
is
seldom
that
one
or
more
vessels
can
not
be
designated
at
the
wharves
respecting
which
there
is
evidence
that
she
is
either
in
or
has
been
concerned
in
the
traffic
on
the
coast
of
africa
it
is
a
fact
that
most
of
the
slave
ships
which
visit
the
river
are
sent
from
new
york
and
new
orleans
the
absence
of
united
states
at
the
brazilian
station
enabled
american
smugglers
to
run
in
cargoes
in
spite
of
the
prohibitory
law
one
cargo
of
five
hundred
slaves
was
landed
in
and
the
regrets
that
it
was
the
flag
of
the
united
states
which
covered
this
act
of
piracy
sustained
by
citizens
of
that
great
nation
when
the
brazil
trade
declined
the
illicit
cuban
trade
greatly
increased
and
the
british
consul
reported
almost
all
the
slave
expeditions
for
some
time
past
have
been
fitted
out
in
the
united
states
chiefly
at
new
york
infractions
of
the
this
decade
is
especially
noteworthy
for
the
great
increase
of
illegal
importations
into
the
south
these
became
bold
frequent
and
notorious
systematic
introduction
on
a
considerable
scale
probably
commenced
in
the
forties
although
with
great
secrecy
to
have
boldly
ventured
into
new
orleans
with
negroes
freshly
imported
from
africa
would
not
only
have
brought
down
upon
the
head
of
the
importer
the
vengeance
of
our
very
philanthropic
uncle
sam
but
also
the
anathemas
of
the
whole
sect
of
philanthropists
and
negrophilists
everywhere
to
import
them
for
years
however
into
quiet
places
evading
with
impunity
the
penalty
of
the
law
and
the
ranting
of
the
sympathizers
with
africa
was
gradually
to
popularize
the
traffic
by
creating
a
demand
for
laborers
and
thus
to
pave
the
way
for
the
revival
of
the
slave
to
this
end
a
few
men
bold
and
energetic
determined
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
or
to
commence
the
business
of
importing
negroes
slowly
at
first
but
surely
and
for
this
purpose
they
selected
a
few
secluded
places
on
the
coast
of
florida
georgia
and
texas
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
their
stock
until
it
could
be
sold
out
without
specifying
other
places
let
me
draw
your
attention
to
a
deep
and
abrupt
pocket
or
indentation
in
the
coast
of
texas
about
thirty
miles
from
brazos
santiago
into
this
pocket
a
slaver
could
run
at
any
hour
of
the
night
because
there
was
no
hindrance
at
the
entrance
and
here
she
could
discharge
her
cargo
of
movables
upon
the
projecting
bluff
and
again
proceed
to
sea
inside
of
three
hours
the
live
stock
thus
landed
could
be
marched
a
short
distance
across
the
main
island
over
a
porous
soil
which
refuses
to
retain
the
recent
until
they
were
again
placed
in
boats
and
were
concealed
upon
some
of
the
innumerable
little
islands
which
thicken
on
the
waters
of
the
laguna
in
the
rear
these
islands
being
covered
with
a
thick
growth
of
bushes
and
grass
offer
an
inscrutable
hiding
place
for
the
diamonds
these
methods
became
however
toward
too
slow
for
the
radicals
and
the
trade
grew
more
defiant
and
open
the
yacht
wanderer
arrested
on
suspicion
in
new
york
and
released
landed
in
georgia
six
months
later
four
hundred
and
twenty
slaves
who
were
never
recovered
the
augusta
says
citizens
of
our
city
are
probably
interested
in
the
enterprise
it
is
hinted
that
this
is
the
third
cargo
landed
by
the
same
company
during
the
last
six
months
two
parties
of
africans
were
brought
into
mobile
with
impunity
one
bark
strongly
suspected
of
having
landed
a
cargo
of
slaves
was
seized
on
the
florida
coast
another
vessel
was
reported
to
be
landing
slaves
near
mobile
a
letter
from
jacksonville
florida
stated
that
a
bark
had
left
there
for
africa
to
ship
a
cargo
for
florida
and
georgia
stephen
douglas
said
that
there
was
not
the
shadow
of
doubt
that
the
had
been
carried
on
quite
extensively
for
a
long
time
back
and
that
there
had
been
more
slaves
imported
into
the
southern
states
during
the
last
year
than
had
ever
been
imported
before
in
any
one
year
even
when
the
was
legal
it
was
his
confident
belief
that
over
fifteen
thousand
slaves
had
been
brought
into
this
country
during
the
past
year
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
three
hundred
of
those
miserable
beings
in
a
in
vicksburg
and
also
large
numbers
at
memphis
it
was
currently
reported
that
depots
for
these
slaves
existed
in
over
twenty
large
cities
and
towns
in
the
south
and
an
interested
person
boasted
to
a
senator
about
that
twelve
vessels
would
discharge
their
living
freight
upon
our
shores
within
ninety
days
from
the
of
june
last
and
that
between
sixty
and
seventy
cargoes
had
been
successfully
introduced
in
the
last
eighteen
months
the
new
york
doubted
the
statement
but
john
underwood
formerly
of
virginia
wrote
to
the
paper
saying
that
he
was
satisfied
that
the
correspondent
was
correct
i
have
he
said
had
ample
evidences
of
the
fact
that
reopening
the
african
is
a
thing
already
accomplished
and
the
traffic
is
brisk
and
rapidly
increasing
in
fact
the
most
vital
question
of
the
day
is
not
the
opening
of
this
trade
but
its
suppression
the
arrival
of
cargoes
of
negroes
fresh
from
africa
in
our
southern
ports
is
an
event
of
frequent
occurrence
negroes
newly
landed
were
openly
advertised
for
sale
in
the
public
press
and
bids
for
additional
importations
made
in
reply
to
one
of
these
the
mobile
facetiously
remarks
some
negroes
who
never
learned
to
talk
english
went
up
the
railroad
the
other
day
congressmen
declared
on
the
floor
of
the
house
the
slave
trade
may
therefore
be
regarded
as
practically
and
petitions
like
that
from
the
american
missionary
society
recited
the
fact
that
this
piratical
and
illegal
trade
this
inhuman
invasion
of
the
rights
of
men
this
outrage
on
civilization
and
christianity
this
violation
of
the
laws
of
god
and
man
is
openly
countenanced
and
encouraged
by
a
portion
of
the
citizens
of
some
of
the
states
of
this
union
from
such
evidence
it
seems
clear
that
the
laws
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
government
in
spite
even
of
much
opposition
to
these
methods
in
the
south
itself
were
grossly
violated
if
not
nearly
nullified
in
the
latter
part
of
the
decade
of
the
federal
during
the
decade
there
was
some
attempt
at
reactionary
legislation
chiefly
directed
at
the
treaty
of
washington
june
slidell
from
the
committee
on
foreign
relations
made
an
elaborate
report
to
the
senate
advocating
the
abrogation
of
the
article
of
that
treaty
on
the
ground
that
it
was
costly
fatal
to
the
health
of
the
sailors
and
useless
as
the
trade
had
actually
increased
under
its
operation
both
this
and
a
similar
attempt
in
the
house
failed
as
did
also
an
attempt
to
substitute
life
imprisonment
for
the
death
penalty
most
of
the
actual
legislation
naturally
took
the
form
of
appropriations
in
there
was
an
attempt
to
appropriate
this
failed
and
the
appropriation
of
in
was
the
first
for
ten
years
the
following
year
brought
a
similar
appropriation
and
in
and
and
respectively
were
appropriated
of
attempted
legislation
to
strengthen
the
laws
there
was
plenty
propositions
to
regulate
the
issue
of
and
the
use
of
our
flag
to
prevent
the
coolie
trade
or
the
bringing
in
of
apprentices
or
african
laborers
to
stop
the
coastwise
trade
to
assent
to
a
right
of
search
and
to
amend
the
constitution
by
forever
prohibiting
the
the
efforts
of
the
executive
during
this
period
were
criminally
lax
and
negligent
the
general
government
did
not
exert
itself
in
good
faith
to
carry
out
either
its
treaty
stipulations
or
the
legislation
of
congress
in
regard
to
the
matter
if
a
vessel
was
captured
her
owners
were
permitted
to
bond
her
and
thus
continue
her
in
the
trade
and
if
any
man
was
convicted
of
this
form
of
piracy
the
executive
always
interposed
between
him
and
the
penalty
of
his
crime
the
laws
providing
for
the
seizure
of
vessels
engaged
in
the
traffic
were
so
constructed
as
to
render
the
duty
unremunerative
and
marshals
now
find
their
fees
for
such
services
to
be
actually
less
than
their
necessary
expenses
no
one
who
bears
this
fact
in
mind
will
be
surprised
at
the
great
indifference
of
these
officers
to
the
continuing
of
the
in
fact
he
will
be
ready
to
learn
that
the
laws
of
congress
upon
the
subject
had
become
a
dead
letter
and
that
the
suspicion
was
well
grounded
that
certain
officers
of
the
federal
government
had
actually
connived
at
their
violation
from
to
in
spite
of
the
activity
of
the
trade
but
five
cases
obtained
cognizance
in
the
new
york
district
of
these
captains
mansfield
and
driscoll
forfeited
their
bonds
of
each
and
escaped
in
the
case
of
the
notorious
canot
nothing
had
been
done
as
late
as
although
he
was
arrested
in
captain
jefferson
turned
state
evidence
and
in
the
case
of
captain
mathew
a
was
entered
between
and
persons
were
indicted
in
new
york
of
whom
only
thirteen
had
at
the
latter
date
been
tried
and
only
one
of
these
convicted
these
dismissals
were
seldom
on
account
of
insufficient
evidence
in
the
notorious
case
of
the
wanderer
she
was
arrested
on
suspicion
released
and
soon
after
she
landed
a
cargo
of
slaves
in
georgia
some
who
attempted
to
seize
the
negroes
were
arrested
for
larceny
and
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
congress
the
captain
was
never
punished
the
yacht
was
afterwards
started
on
another
voyage
and
being
brought
back
to
boston
was
sold
to
her
former
owner
for
about
one
third
her
value
the
bark
emily
was
seized
on
suspicion
and
released
and
finally
caught
on
the
coast
of
africa
she
was
sent
to
new
york
for
trial
but
disappeared
under
a
certain
slave
captain
townsend
who
had
previous
to
this
in
the
face
of
the
most
convincing
evidence
been
acquitted
at
key
west
the
squadron
commanders
of
this
time
were
by
no
means
as
efficient
as
their
predecessors
and
spent
much
of
their
time
apparently
in
discussing
the
right
of
search
instead
of
a
number
of
small
light
vessels
which
by
the
reports
of
experts
were
repeatedly
shown
to
be
the
only
efficient
craft
the
government
until
persisted
in
sending
out
three
or
four
great
frigates
even
these
did
not
attend
faithfully
to
their
duties
a
letter
from
on
board
one
of
them
shows
that
out
of
a
fifteen
months
alleged
service
only
days
were
spent
on
the
usual
for
slavers
and
thirteen
of
these
at
anchor
eleven
months
were
spent
at
madeira
and
cape
verde
islands
miles
from
the
coast
and
miles
from
the
slave
market
british
commanders
report
the
apathy
of
american
officers
and
the
extreme
caution
of
their
instructions
which
allowed
many
slavers
to
escape
the
officials
at
washington
often
remained
in
blissful
and
perhaps
willing
ignorance
of
the
state
of
the
trade
while
americans
were
smuggling
slaves
by
the
thousands
into
brazil
and
by
the
hundreds
into
the
united
states
secretary
graham
was
recommending
the
abrogation
of
the
article
of
the
treaty
of
washington
so
too
when
the
cuban
was
reaching
unprecedented
activity
and
while
slavers
were
being
fitted
out
in
every
port
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
secretary
kennedy
naïvely
reports
the
time
has
come
perhaps
when
it
may
be
properly
commended
to
the
notice
of
congress
to
inquire
into
the
necessity
of
further
continuing
the
regular
employment
of
a
squadron
on
this
the
african
coast
again
in
the
government
has
advices
that
the
slave
trade
south
of
the
equator
is
entirely
broken
up
in
the
reports
are
favorable
in
a
british
commander
writes
no
vessel
has
been
seen
here
for
one
year
certainly
i
think
for
nearly
three
years
there
have
been
no
american
cruizers
on
these
waters
where
a
valuable
and
extensive
american
commerce
is
carried
on
i
can
not
therefore
but
think
that
this
continued
absence
of
foreign
cruizers
looks
as
if
they
were
intentionally
withdrawn
and
as
if
the
government
did
not
care
to
take
measures
to
prevent
the
american
flag
being
used
to
cover
slave
trade
transactions
nevertheless
in
this
same
year
according
to
secretary
toucey
the
force
on
the
coast
of
africa
has
fully
accomplished
its
main
object
finally
in
the
same
month
in
which
the
wanderer
and
her
mates
were
openly
landing
cargoes
in
the
south
president
buchanan
who
seems
to
have
been
utterly
devoid
of
a
sense
of
humor
was
urging
the
annexation
of
cuba
to
the
united
states
as
the
only
method
of
suppressing
the
about
the
frequent
and
notorious
violations
of
our
laws
aroused
even
the
buchanan
government
a
larger
appropriation
was
obtained
swift
light
steamers
were
employed
and
though
we
may
well
doubt
whether
after
such
a
carnival
illegal
importations
entirely
ceased
as
the
president
informed
congress
yet
some
sincere
efforts
at
suppression
were
certainly
begun
from
to
we
have
few
notices
of
captured
slavers
but
in
the
increased
appropriation
of
the
congress
resulted
in
the
capture
of
twelve
vessels
with
africans
the
act
of
june
enabled
the
president
to
contract
with
the
colonization
society
for
the
return
of
recaptured
africans
and
by
a
arrangement
cruisers
were
to
proceed
direct
to
africa
with
such
cargoes
instead
of
first
landing
them
in
this
country
of
the
southern
the
attempt
initiated
by
the
constitutional
fathers
to
separate
the
problem
of
slavery
from
that
of
the
had
after
a
trial
of
half
a
century
signally
failed
and
for
economic
reasons
the
nation
had
at
last
come
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
one
of
which
led
to
a
system
the
other
to
a
slave
system
fed
by
the
both
sections
of
the
country
naturally
hesitated
at
the
the
north
clung
to
the
delusion
that
a
territorially
limited
system
of
slavery
without
a
was
still
possible
in
the
south
the
south
hesitated
to
fight
for
her
logical
object
slavery
and
free
trade
in
negroes
and
in
her
moral
and
economic
dilemma
sought
to
make
autonomy
and
the
constitution
her
object
the
real
line
of
contention
was
however
fixed
by
years
of
development
and
was
unalterable
by
the
present
whims
or
wishes
of
the
contestants
no
matter
how
important
or
interesting
these
might
be
the
triumph
of
the
north
meant
free
labor
the
triumph
of
the
south
meant
slavery
and
the
it
is
doubtful
if
many
of
the
southern
leaders
ever
deceived
themselves
by
thinking
that
southern
slavery
as
it
then
was
could
long
be
maintained
without
a
general
or
a
partial
reopening
of
the
many
had
openly
declared
this
a
few
years
before
and
there
was
no
reason
for
a
change
of
opinion
nevertheless
at
the
outbreak
of
actual
war
and
secession
there
were
powerful
and
decisive
reasons
for
relegating
the
question
temporarily
to
the
rear
in
the
first
place
only
by
this
means
could
the
adherence
of
important
border
states
be
secured
without
the
aid
of
which
secession
was
folly
secondly
while
it
did
no
harm
to
laud
the
independence
of
the
south
and
the
kingship
of
cotton
in
stump
speeches
and
conventions
yet
when
it
came
to
actual
hostilities
the
south
sorely
needed
the
aid
of
europe
and
this
a
nation
fighting
for
slavery
and
the
stood
poor
chance
of
getting
consequently
after
attacking
the
laws
for
a
decade
and
their
execution
for
a
we
find
the
southern
leaders
inserting
in
both
the
provisional
and
the
permanent
constitutions
of
the
confederate
states
the
following
article
the
importation
of
negroes
of
the
african
race
from
any
foreign
country
other
than
the
slaveholding
states
or
territories
of
the
united
states
of
america
is
hereby
forbidden
and
congress
is
required
to
pass
such
laws
as
shall
effectually
prevent
the
same
congress
shall
also
have
power
to
prohibit
the
introduction
of
slaves
from
any
state
not
a
member
of
or
territory
not
belonging
to
this
confederacy
the
attitude
of
the
confederate
government
toward
this
article
is
best
illustrated
by
its
circular
of
instructions
to
its
foreign
ministers
it
has
been
suggested
to
this
government
from
a
source
of
unquestioned
authenticity
that
after
the
recognition
of
our
independence
by
the
european
powers
an
expectation
is
generally
entertained
by
them
that
in
our
treaties
of
amity
and
commerce
a
clause
will
be
introduced
making
stipulations
against
the
african
slave
trade
it
is
even
thought
that
neutral
powers
may
be
inclined
to
insist
upon
the
insertion
of
such
a
clause
as
a
qua
you
are
well
aware
how
firmly
fixed
in
our
constitution
is
the
policy
of
this
confederacy
against
the
opening
of
that
trade
but
we
are
informed
that
false
and
insidious
suggestions
have
been
made
by
the
agents
of
the
united
states
at
european
courts
of
our
intention
to
change
our
constitution
as
soon
as
peace
is
restored
and
of
authorizing
the
importation
of
slaves
from
africa
if
therefore
you
should
find
in
your
intercourse
with
the
cabinet
to
which
you
are
accredited
that
any
such
impressions
are
entertained
you
will
use
every
proper
effort
to
remove
them
and
if
an
attempt
is
made
to
introduce
into
any
treaty
which
you
may
be
charged
with
negotiating
stipulations
on
the
subject
just
mentioned
you
will
assume
in
behalf
of
your
government
the
position
which
under
the
direction
of
the
president
i
now
proceed
to
develop
the
constitution
of
the
confederate
states
is
an
agreement
made
between
independent
states
by
its
terms
all
the
powers
of
government
are
separated
into
classes
as
follows
viz
such
powers
as
the
states
delegate
to
the
general
government
such
powers
as
the
states
agree
to
refrain
from
exercising
although
they
do
not
delegate
them
to
the
general
government
such
powers
as
the
states
without
delegating
them
to
the
general
government
thought
proper
to
exercise
by
direct
agreement
between
themselves
contained
in
the
constitution
all
remaining
powers
of
sovereignty
which
not
being
delegated
to
the
confederate
states

the
constitution
nor
prohibited
by
it

are
reserved
to
the
states
respectively
or
to
the
people
thereof
especially
in
relation
to
the
importation
of
african
negroes
was
it
deemed
important
by
the
states
that
no
power
to
permit
it
should
exist
in
the
confederate
government
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
no
power
is
delegated
to
the
confederate
government
over
this
subject
but
that
it
is
included
in
the
third
class
above
referred
to
of
powers
exercised
directly
by
the
states
this
government
unequivocally
and
absolutely
denies
its
possession
of
any
power
whatever
over
the
subject
and
can
not
entertain
any
proposition
in
relation
to
it
the
policy
of
the
confederacy
is
as
fixed
and
immutable
on
this
subject
as
the
imperfection
of
human
nature
permits
human
resolve
to
be
no
additional
agreements
treaties
or
stipulations
can
commit
these
states
to
the
prohibition
of
the
african
slave
trade
with
more
binding
efficacy
than
those
they
have
themselves
devised
a
just
and
generous
confidence
in
their
good
faith
on
this
subject
exhibited
by
friendly
powers
will
be
far
more
efficacious
than
persistent
efforts
to
induce
this
government
to
assume
the
exercise
of
powers
which
it
does
not
possess
we
trust
therefore
that
no
unnecessary
discussions
on
this
matter
will
be
introduced
into
your
negotiations
if
unfortunately
this
reliance
should
prove
you
will
decline
continuing
negotiations
on
your
side
and
transfer
them
to
us
at
home
this
attitude
of
the
conservative
leaders
of
the
south
if
it
meant
anything
meant
that
individual
state
action
could
when
it
pleased
reopen
the
the
radicals
were
of
course
not
satisfied
with
any
veiling
of
the
ulterior
purpose
of
the
new
slave
republic
and
attacked
the
constitutional
provision
violently
if
said
one
the
clause
be
carried
into
the
permanent
government
our
whole
movement
is
defeated
it
will
abolitionize
the
border

slavery
can
not
share

with

it
can
not

having
achieved
one

to
escape

at

it
must
still
achieve
another
to

at
the

that
it
will
ultimately
triumph
none
can
doubt
of
the
united
in
the
north
with
all
the
hesitation
in
many
matters
there
existed
unanimity
in
regard
to
the
and
the
new
lincoln
government
ushered
in
the
new
policy
of
uncompromising
suppression
by
hanging
the
first
american
who
ever
suffered
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
one
of
the
earliest
acts
of
president
lincoln
was
a
step
which
had
been
necessary
since
but
had
never
been
taken
the
unification
of
the
whole
work
of
suppression
into
the
hands
of
one
responsible
department
by
an
order
dated
may
caleb
smith
secretary
of
the
interior
was
charged
with
the
execution
of
the
laws
and
he
immediately
began
energetic
work
early
in
as
soon
as
the
withdrawal
of
the
southern
members
untied
the
hands
of
congress
two
appropriations
of
each
were
made
to
suppress
the
slave
trade
the
first
appropriations
commensurate
with
the
vastness
of
the
task
these
were
followed
by
four
appropriations
of
each
in
the
years
to
and
two
of
each
in
and
the
first
work
of
the
new
secretary
was
to
obtain
a
corps
of
efficient
assistants
to
this
end
he
assembled
all
the
marshals
of
the
loyal
seaboard
states
at
new
york
and
gave
them
instruction
and
opportunity
to
inspect
actual
slavers
congress
also
for
the
first
time
offered
them
proper
compensation
the
next
six
months
showed
the
effect
of
this
policy
in
the
fact
that
five
vessels
were
seized
and
condemned
and
four
were
convicted
and
suffered
the
penalty
of
their
crimes
this
is
probably
the
largest
number
of
convictions
ever
obtained
and
certainly
the
only
ones
for
many
years
meantime
the
government
opened
negotiations
with
great
britain
and
the
treaty
of
was
signed
june
and
carried
out
by
act
of
congress
july
specially
commissioned
war
vessels
of
either
government
were
by
this
agreement
authorized
to
search
merchant
vessels
on
the
high
seas
and
specified
coasts
and
if
they
were
found
to
be
slavers
or
on
account
of
their
construction
or
equipment
were
suspected
to
be
such
they
were
to
be
sent
for
condemnation
to
one
of
the
mixed
courts
established
at
new
york
sierra
leone
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
these
courts
consisting
of
one
judge
and
one
arbitrator
on
the
part
of
each
government
were
to
judge
the
facts
without
appeal
and
upon
condemnation
by
them
the
culprits
were
to
be
punished
according
to
the
laws
of
their
respective
countries
the
area
in
which
this
right
of
search
could
be
exercised
was
somewhat
enlarged
by
an
additional
article
to
the
treaty
signed
in
in
the
mixed
courts
were
abolished
but
the
main
part
of
the
treaty
was
left
in
force
the
act
of
july
enabled
the
president
to
contract
with
foreign
governments
for
the
apprenticing
of
recaptured
africans
in
the
west
indies
and
in
the
coastwise
was
forever
prohibited
by
these
measures
the
trade
was
soon
checked
and
before
the
end
of
the
war
entirely
suppressed
the
vigilance
of
the
government
however
was
not
checked
and
as

as
a

of

patrolled

the

for

the
question
we
have
followed
a
chapter
of
history
which
is
of
peculiar
interest
to
the
sociologist
here
was
a
rich
new
land
the
wealth
of
which
was
to
be
had
in
return
for
ordinary
manual
labor
had
the
country
been
conceived
of
as
existing
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
its
actual
inhabitants
it
might
have
waited
for
natural
increase
or
immigration
to
supply
the
needed
hands
but
both
europe
and
the
earlier
colonists
themselves
regarded
this
land
as
existing
chiefly
for
the
benefit
of
europe
and
as
designed
to
be
exploited
as
rapidly
and
ruthlessly
as
possible
of
the
boundless
wealth
of
its
resources
this
was
the
primary
excuse
for
the
rise
of
the
african
to
america
every
experiment
of
such
a
kind
however
where
the
moral
standard
of
a
people
is
lowered
for
the
sake
of
a
material
advantage
is
dangerous
in
just
such
proportion
as
that
advantage
is
great
in
this
case
it
was
great
for
at
least
a
century
in
the
west
indies
and
the
southern
united
states
agriculture
flourished
trade
increased
and
english
manufactures
were
nourished
in
just
such
proportion
as
americans
stole
negroes
and
worked
them
to
death
this
advantage
to
be
sure
became
much
smaller
in
later
times
and
at
one
critical
period
was
at
least
in
the
southern
states
almost
but
energetic
efforts
were
wanting
and
before
the
nation
was
aware
slavery
had
seized
a
new
and
immovable
footing
in
the
cotton
kingdom
the
colonists
averred
with
perfect
truth
that
they
did
not
commence
this
fatal
traffic
but
that
it
was
imposed
upon
them
from
without
nevertheless
all
too
soon
did
they
lay
aside
scruples
against
it
and
hasten
to
share
its
material
benefits
even
those
who
braved
the
rough
atlantic
for
the
highest
moral
motives
fell
early
victims
to
the
allurements
of
this
system
thus
throughout
colonial
history
in
spite
of
many
honest
attempts
to
stop
the
further
pursuit
of
the
we
notice
back
of
nearly
all
such
attempts
a
certain
moral
apathy
an
indisposition
to
attack
the
evil
with
the
sharp
weapons
which
its
nature
demanded
consequently
there
developed
steadily
irresistibly
a
vast
social
problem
which
required
two
centuries
and
a
half
for
a
nation
of
trained
european
stock
and
boasted
moral
fibre
to
solve
moral
for
the
solution
of
this
problem
there
were
roughly
speaking
three
classes
of
efforts
made
during
this
time
moral
political
and
economic
that
is
to
say
efforts
which
sought
directly
to
raise
the
moral
standard
of
the
nation
efforts
which
sought
to
stop
the
trade
by
legal
enactment
efforts
which
sought
to
neutralize
the
economic
advantages
of
the
there
is
always
a
certain
glamour
about
the
idea
of
a
nation
rising
up
to
crush
an
evil
simply
because
it
is
wrong
unfortunately
this
can
seldom
be
realized
in
real
life
for
the
very
existence
of
the
evil
usually
argues
a
moral
weakness
in
the
very
place
where
extraordinary
moral
strength
is
called
for
this
was
the
case
in
the
early
history
of
the
colonies
and
experience
proved
that
an
appeal
to
moral
rectitude
was
unheard
in
carolina
when
rice
had
become
a
great
crop
and
in
massachusetts
when
the
was
paying
a
profit
of
that
the
various
abolition
societies
and
movements
did
heroic
work
in
rousing
the
national
conscience
is
certainly
true
unfortunately
however
these
movements
were
weakest
at
the
most
critical
times
when
in
and
the
material
advantages
of
the
and
the
institution
of
slavery
were
least
it
seemed
possible
that
moral
suasion
might
accomplish
the
abolition
of
both
a
fatal
spirit
of
temporizing
however
seized
the
nation
at
these
points
and
although
the
was
largely
for
political
reasons
forbidden
slavery
was
left
untouched
beyond
this
point
as
years
rolled
by
it
was
found
impossible
to
rouse
the
moral
sense
of
the
nation
even
in
the
matter
of
enforcing
its
own
laws
and
with
the
civilized
world
a
lethargy
seized
the
country
and
it
did
not
awake
until
slavery
was
about
to
destroy
it
even
then
after
a
long
and
earnest
crusade
the
national
sense
of
right
did
not
rise
to
the
entire
abolition
of
slavery
it
was
only
a
peculiar
and
almost
fortuitous
commingling
of
moral
political
and
economic
motives
that
eventually
crushed
african
slavery
and
its
handmaid
the
in
america
political
the
political
efforts
to
limit
the
were
the
outcome
partly
of
moral
reprobation
of
the
trade
partly
of
motives
of
expediency
this
legislation
was
never
such
as
wise
and
powerful
rulers
may
make
for
a
nation
with
the
ulterior
purpose
of
calling
in
the
respect
which
the
nation
has
for
law
to
aid
in
raising
its
standard
of
right
the
colonial
and
national
laws
on
the
merely
registered
from
time
to
time
the
average
public
opinion
concerning
this
traffic
and
are
therefore
to
be
regarded
as
negative
signs
rather
than
as
positive
efforts
these
signs
were
from
one
point
of
view
evidences
of
moral
awakening
they
indicated
slow
steady
development
of
the
idea
that
to
steal
even
negroes
was
wrong
from
another
point
of
view
these
laws
showed
the
fear
of
servile
insurrection
and
the
desire
to
ward
off
danger
from
the
state
again
they
often
indicated
a
desire
to
appear
well
before
the
civilized
world
and
to
rid
the
land
of
the
free
of
the
paradox
of
slavery
representing
such
motives
the
laws
varied
all
the
way
from
mere
regulating
acts
to
absolute
prohibitions
on
the
whole
these
acts
were
poorly
conceived
loosely
drawn
and
wretchedly
enforced
the
systematic
violation
of
the
provisions
of
many
of
them
led
to
a
widespread
belief
that
enforcement
was
in
the
nature
of
the
case
impossible
and
thus
instead
of
marking
ground
already
won
they
were
too
often
sources
of
distinct
moral
deterioration
certainly
the
carnival
of
lawlessness
that
succeeded
the
act
of
and
that
which
preceded
final
suppression
in
were
glaring
examples
of
the
failure
of
the
efforts
to
suppress
the
by
mere
law
economic
economic
measures
against
the
trade
were
those
which
from
the
beginning
had
the
best
chance
of
success
but
which
were
least
tried
they
included
tariff
measures
efforts
to
encourage
the
immigration
of
free
laborers
and
the
emigration
of
the
slaves
measures
for
changing
the
character
of
southern
industry
and
finally
plans
to
restore
the
economic
balance
which
slavery
destroyed
by
raising
the
condition
of
the
slave
to
that
of
complete
freedom
and
responsibility
like
the
political
efforts
these
rested
in
part
on
a
moral
basis
and
as
legal
enactments
they
were
also
themselves
often
political
measures
they
differed
however
from
purely
moral
and
political
efforts
in
having
as
a
main
motive
the
economic
gain
which
a
substitution
of
free
for
slave
labor
promised
the
simplest
form
of
such
efforts
was
the
revenue
duty
on
slaves
that
existed
in
all
the
colonies
this
developed
into
the
prohibitive
tariff
and
into
measures
encouraging
immigration
or
industrial
improvements
the
colonization
movement
was
another
form
of
these
efforts
it
was
inadequately
conceived
and
not
altogether
sincere
but
it
had
a
sound
although
in
this
case
impracticable
economic
basis
the
one
great
measure
which
finally
stopped
the
forever
was
naturally
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
giving
to
the
negro
the
right
to
sell
his
labor
at
a
price
consistent
with
his
own
welfare
the
abolition
of
slavery
itself
while
due
in
part
to
direct
moral
appeal
and
political
sagacity
was
largely
the
result
of
the
economic
collapse
of
the
slave
system
lesson
for
it
may
be
doubted
if
ever
before
such
political
mistakes
as
the
slavery
compromises
of
the
constitutional
convention
had
such
serious
results
and
yet
by
a
succession
of
unexpected
accidents
still
left
a
nation
in
position
to
work
out
its
destiny
no
american
can
study
the
connection
of
slavery
with
united
states
history
and
not
devoutly
pray
that
his
country
may
never
have
a
similar
social
problem
to
solve
until
it
shows
more
capacity
for
such
work
than
it
has
shown
in
the
past
it
is
neither
profitable
nor
in
accordance
with
scientific
truth
to
consider
that
whatever
the
constitutional
fathers
did
was
right
or
that
slavery
was
a
plague
sent
from
god
and
fated
to
be
eliminated
in
due
time
we
must
face
the
fact
that
this
problem
arose
principally
from
the
cupidity
and
carelessness
of
our
ancestors
it
was
the
plain
duty
of
the
colonies
to
crush
the
trade
and
the
system
in
its
infancy
they
preferred
to
enrich
themselves
on
its
profits
it
was
the
plain
duty
of
a
revolution
based
upon
liberty
to
take
steps
toward
the
abolition
of
slavery
it
preferred
promises
to
straightforward
action
it
was
the
plain
duty
of
the
constitutional
convention
in
founding
a
new
nation
to
compromise
with
a
threatening
social
evil
only
in
case
its
settlement
would
thereby
be
postponed
to
a
more
favorable
time
this
was
not
the
case
in
the
slavery
and
the
compromises
there
never
was
a
time
in
the
history
of
america
when
the
system
had
a
slighter
economic
political
and
moral
justification
than
in
and
yet
with
this
real
existent
growing
evil
before
their
eyes
a
bargain
largely
of
dollars
and
cents
was
allowed
to
open
the
highway
that
led
straight
to
the
civil
war
moreover
it
was
due
to
no
wisdom
and
foresight
on
the
part
of
the
fathers
that
fortuitous
circumstances
made
the
result
of
that
war
what
it
was
nor
was
it
due
to
exceptional
philanthropy
on
the
part
of
their
descendants
that
that
result
included
the
abolition
of
slavery
with
the
faith
of
the
nation
broken
at
the
very
outset
the
system
of
slavery
untouched
and
twenty
years
respite
given
to
the
to
feed
and
foster
it
there
began
with
that
system
of
bargaining
truckling
and
compromising
with
a
moral
political
and
economic
monstrosity
which
makes
the
history
of
our
dealing
with
slavery
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
so
discreditable
to
a
great
people
each
generation
sought
to
shift
its
load
upon
the
next
and
the
burden
rolled
on
until
a
generation
came
which
was
both
too
weak
and
too
strong
to
bear
it
longer
one
can
not
to
be
sure
demand
of
whole
nations
exceptional
moral
foresight
and
heroism
but
a
certain
hard
in
facing
the
complicated
phenomena
of
political
life
must
be
expected
in
every
progressive
people
in
some
respects
we
as
a
nation
seem
to
lack
this
we
have
the
somewhat
inchoate
idea
that
we
are
not
destined
to
be
harassed
with
great
social
questions
and
that
even
if
we
are
and
fail
to
answer
them
the
fault
is
with
the
question
and
not
with
us
consequently
we
often
congratulate
ourselves
more
on
getting
rid
of
a
problem
than
on
solving
it
such
an
attitude
is
dangerous
we
have
and
shall
have
as
other
peoples
have
had
critical
momentous
and
pressing
questions
to
answer
the
riddle
of
the
sphinx
may
be
postponed
it
may
be
evasively
answered
now
sometime
it
must
be
fully
answered
it
behooves
the
united
states
therefore
in
the
interest
both
of
scientific
truth
and
of
future
social
reform
carefully
to
study
such
chapters
of
her
history
as
that
of
the
suppression
of
the
the
most
obvious
question
which
this
study
suggests
is
how
far
in
a
state
can
a
recognized
moral
wrong
safely
be
compromised
and
although
this
chapter
of
history
can
give
us
no
definite
answer
suited
to
the
aspects
of
political
life
yet
it
would
seem
to
warn
any
nation
from
allowing
through
carelessness
and
moral
cowardice
any
social
evil
to
grow
no
persons
would
have
seen
the
civil
war
with
more
surprise
and
horror
than
the
revolutionists
of
yet
from
the
small
and
apparently
dying
institution
of
their
day
arose
the
walled
and
castled
from
this
we
may
conclude
that
it
behooves
nations
as
well
as
men
to
do
things
at
the
very
moment
when
they
ought
to
be
done

objected

was
a
right

it

the

the
suppression
of
the
african
slave
trade
by
five
of
the
powers

and
to
which
france
is
a
party
is
a
fact
of
such
general
notoriety
that
it
may
be
assumed
as
the
basis
of
any
diplomatic
representations
which
the
subject
may
fairly

is
no
party
to
this
treaty
she
denies
the
right
of
visitation
which
england
asserts
quotes
from
the
presidential
message
of
this
principle
is
asserted
by
the
the
moral
effect
which
such
a
union
of
five
great
powers
two
of
which
are
eminently
maritime
but
three
of
which
have
perhaps
never
had
a
vessel
engaged
in
that
traffic
is
calculated
to
produce
upon
the
united
states
and
upon
other
nations
who
like
them
may
be
indisposed
to
these
combined
movements
though
it
may
be
regretted
yet
furnishes
no
just
cause
of
complaint
but
the
subject
assumes
another
aspect
when
they
are
told
by
one
of
the
parties
that
their
vessels
are
to
be
forcibly
entered
and
examined
in
order
to
carry
into
effect
these
stipulations
certainly
the
american
government
does
not
believe
that
the
high
powers
contracting
parties
to
this
treaty
have
any
wish
to
compel
the

by
force
to
adopt
their
measures
to
its
provisions
or
to
adopt

they
will
see
with
pleasure
the
prompt
disavowal
made
by
yourself
sir
in
the

your
country
of
any
intentions
of
this
nature

were
it
otherwise
they
would
prepare
themselves

without
dismay
with
regret

with
firmness

one
of
those
desperate
struggles
which

lessen

it
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
point
to
the
fact
that
unrestricted
immigration
has
not
diminished
the
value
of
labor
in
the
northwestern
section
of

the
cry
there
is
want
of
labor
notwithstanding
capital
has
the
pauperism
of
the
old
world
to
press
into
its
grinding
service
if
we
can
not
supply
the
demand
for
slave
labor
then
we
must
expect
to
be
supplied
with
a
species
of
labor
we
do
not
want
and
which
is
from
the
very
nature
of
things
antagonistic
to
our
institutions
it
is
much
better
that
our
drays
should
be
driven
by
slaves
that
our
factories
should
be
worked
by
slaves
that
our
hotels
should
be
served
by
slaves
that
our
locomotives
should
be
manned
by
slaves
than
that
we
should
be
exposed
to
the
introduction
from
any
quarter
of
a
population
alien
to
us
by
birth
training
and
education
and
which
in
the
process
of
time
must
lead
to
that
conflict
between
capital

labor
makes

the

that

condition
is
a
constant
source

injury

annoyance
to
the
american
people
it
is

spot
in

where
the

is
tolerated

we
are
bound
by

to
maintain
a
naval

on
the

much
expense
both
of
life

for
the

now

could
never

if

had
not
afforded
a

for

as
long
as
this
market
shall
remain

there
can
be
no
hope
for
the
civilization
of
benighted
africa
it
has
been
made
known
to
the
world
by
my
predecessors
that
the

have
on
several
occasions
endeavored
to
acquire
cuba
from
spain
by

if
this

the

would

disappear
we

we
could

in

this

have

a
topic
of
discussion
with
newspaper
writers
and
political
agitators
many
of
them
boldly
denouncing

as
unwise
in

and
disgraceful
in

provisions
and
insisting
on
the
justice
and
propriety
of
their
repeal
and
the
revival
of
the
odious
traffic
in

and
whereas
recent

afford
strong
reasons
to
apprehend

their

openly
countenanced

encouraged

of

facts
that
the

representatives

therefore
that
while

recognize
no

of

federal
government
or
any
other
power
save
that
of
the
states
wherein
it
exists
to
interfere
with

disturb

institution

slavery
where
it
is
established

protected

we
do
hold
that
congress
has
power
to
prohibit
the
foreign
traffic
and
that
no
legislation
can
be
too
thorough
in
its
measures
nor
can
any
penalty
known
to
the
catalogue
of
modern
punishment
for
crime
be
too
severe
against
a
traffic
so
inhuman
and
unchristian
that
the
laws
in
force
against
said
traffic
are
founded
upon
the
broadest
principles
of
philanthropy
religion
and
humanity
that
they
should
remain
unchanged
except
so
far
as
legislation
may
be
needed
to
render
them
more
efficient
that
they
should
be
