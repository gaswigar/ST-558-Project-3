i
have
felt
for
many
years
that
we
missionaries
were
far
too
prone
to
dwell
on
what
is
called
the
bright
side
of
mission
work
that
it
has
a
bright
side
no
one
can
question
that
it
has
a
dark
side
some
do
question
but
i
for
one
after
thirty
years
of
experience
know
it
to
be
just
as
true
as
the
bright
side
is
true
i
have
heard
miss
book
denounced
as
pessimistic
just
what
is
meant
by
that
i
am
not
quite
sure
but
if
it
means
that
what
she
has
written
is
untrue
then
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
it
is
not
pessimistic
there
is
not
a
line
of
it
that
can
not
be
duplicated
in
this
telugu
that
she
has
painted
a
dark
picture
of
hindu
life
can
not
be
denied
but
it
is
every
word
i
rejoice
that
she
had
the
courage
to
do
what
was
so
much
needed
and
yet
what
so
many
of
us
shrank
from
doing

should

this

as

real
need
depicts
a
phase
of
mission
work
of
which
as
a
rule
very
little
is
every
missionary
can
tell
of
cases
where
people
have
been
won
for
christ
and
mention
incidents
of
more
than
passing

miss
carmichael
is
no
exception
and
could
tell
of
not
a
few

danger
is
lest
in
describing
such
incidents
the
impression
should
be
given
that
they
represent
the
normal
state
of
things
the
reverse

the
the
people
of

are
not
thirsting
for

nor
calling

deliver

is
still
one
in
which
the
spiritual
hosts
of
wickedness
have
to
be
overcome

can

has
laid
all

such
a
graphic
and
accurate
picture
of
the
difficulties
that
have
to
be
faced
and
the
obstacles
to
be
overcome
counterparts
of
the
incidents
recorded
can
be
found
in
other
parts
of
south
india
and
there
are
probably
few
missionaries
engaged
in

i
am
not
surprised
that
anyone
unacquainted
with
mission
work
in
india
should
be
staggered
at
the
facts
narrated
in
as
they
but
as
one
who
has
worked
for
nearly
thirty
years
in
the
heart
of
heathenism
away
from
the
haunts
of
civilisation
i
can
bear
testimony
the
reality
of
things
far
exceeds
anything
that
it
would
be
possible
to
put
into
one
tongue
falters
to
tell
of
what
is
custom
in
this
country
i
know
a
case
where
a
young
girl
of
ten
was
placed
in
such
a
position
that
her
choice
lay
between
two
sinful
courses
of
life
right
way
being
open
to
i
think
one
of
the
most
distressing
things
we
have
to
meet
in
caste
work
in
this
country
is
the
fact
that
often
as
soon
as
a
soul
begins
to
show
interest
in
christ
or
she
and
one
either
hears
next
that
he
is
dead
or
can
get
no
reliable
information
at
all
a
letter
to
miss
carmichael
on
as
they
the
writer
is
a
veteran
american
missionary
could
duplicate
nearly
every
incident
in
the
so
i
know
it
is
a
true
picture
not
alone
because
i
believe
your
word
but
because
my
experience
has
been
so
similar
to
yours
many
times
while
reading
it
the
memory
of
the
old
has
been
so
vivid
that
i
have
had
to
lay
the
book
down
and
look
round
the
familiar
room
in
order
to
convince
myself
that
it
was
you
and
not
i
who
was
agonising
over
one
of
the
king
own
children
who
was
being
crowded
back
into
darkness
and
hurled
down
to
destruction
because
satan
wrath
is
great
as
he
realises
that
his
time
is
short

wish
the
book
might
be
read
by
all
the
christians

the
homeland

while
i
was
reading
as
they
i
fancied
i
was
living
my
old
life
among
hindus
over
again
i
can
honestly
corroborate
everything
said
in
regard
to
the
religious
and
social
life
of
the
hindus
i
came
from
that
part
of
the
country
and
i
am
very
glad
that
the
book
has
succeeded
in
bringing
the
truth
to
light
miss
trotter
there
is
hardly
a
phase
of
all
the
retold
that
we
have
not
known
page
after
page
might
have
been
written
out
here
word
for
word
preface
the
writer
of
these
thrilling
chapters
is
a
keswick
missionary
well
known
to
many
friends
as
the
adopted
daughter
of
robert
wilson
the
chairman
of
the
keswick
convention
she
worked
for
a
time
with
the
rev
barclay
buxton
in
japan
and
for
the
last
few
years
she
has
been
with
the
rev
walker
also
a
missionary
in
tinnevelly
and
is
on
the
staff
of
the
church
of
england
zenana
society
i
do
not
think
the
realities
of
hindu
life
have
ever
been
portrayed
with
greater
vividness
than
in
this
book
and
i
know
that
the
accuracy
can
be
fully
relied
upon
the
picture
is
drawn
without
prejudice
with
all
sympathy
with
full
recognition
of
what
is
good
and
yet
with
an
unswerving
determination
to
tell
the
truth
and
let
the
facts
be
known
that
is
so
far
as
she
dares
to
tell
them
what
she
says
is
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
but
it
is
not
the
whole
truth
she
could
not
tell
if
she
wrote
it
it
could
not
be
printed
if
it
were
printed
it
could
not
be
read
but
if
we
read
between
the
lines
we
do
just
catch
glimpses
of
what
she
calls
the
actual
it
is
evident
that
the
authoress
deeply
felt
the
responsibility
of
writing
such
a
book
and
i
too
feel
the
responsibility
of
recommending
it
i
do
so
with
the
prayer
of
my
heart
that
god
will
use
it
to
move
many
it
is
not
a
book
to
be
read
with
a
lazy
kind
of
sentimental
interest
it
is
a
book
to
send
the
reader
to
his
knees
still
more
to
knees
most
of
the
chapters
are
concerned
with
the
lives
of
heathen
men
and
women
and
children
surrounded
by
the
tremendous
bars
and
gates
of
the
caste
system
but
one
chapter
and
not
the
least
important
one
tells
of
native
christians
it
has
long
been
one
of
my
own
objects
to
correct
the
curious
general
impression
among
people
at
home
that
native
christians
as
a
body
are
not
indeed
perfect
no
one
thinks
that
but
earnest
and
consistent
followers
of
christ
narratives
true
narratives
of
true
converts
are
read
and
these
are
supposed
to
be
specimens
of
the
whole
body
but
where
there
have
been
mass
movements
towards
christianity
where
whole
villages
have
put
themselves
under
christian
instruction
mixed
motives
are
certain
where
there
have
been
two
or
three
generations
of
christians
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
the
descendants
of
men
who
may
have
been
themselves
most
true
converts
to
be
necessarily
like
them
hereditary
christianity
in
india
is
much
like
hereditary
christianity
at
home
the
church
in
tinnevelly
of
which
this
book
incidentally
tells
a
little
is
marked
by
both
these
features
whole
families
or
even
villages
have
come
over
at
times
and
the
large
majority
of
the
christians
were
so
to
speak
born
christians
and
were
baptized
in
infancy
this
is
not
in
itself
a
result
to
be
despised
christian
england
unchristian
as
a
great
part
of
its
population
really
is
is
better
than
heathen
india
and
in
the
chapter
now
referred
to
miss
carmichael
herself
notices
the
difference
between
a
hindu
and
a
christian
village
but
the
more
widely
christianity
spreads
the
more
will
there
assuredly
be
of
mere
nominal
profession
is
the
incorrect
impression
i
allude
to
caused
by
missionaries
dwelling
mostly
on
the
brighter
side
of
their
work
here
and
there
in
the
book
there
is
just
a
suggestion
that
they
are
wrong
in
doing
so
but
how
can
they
help
it
what
does
a
clergyman
or
an
evangelist
in
england
tell
of
does
he
tell
of
his
many
daily
disappointments
or
of
his
occasional
encouraging
cases
the
latter
are
the
events
of
his
life
and
he
naturally
tells
of
them
the
former
he
comprises
in
some
general
statement
how
can
he
do
otherwise
and
what
can
the
modern
missionary
do
in
the
short
reports
he
is
able
to
write
fifty
years
ago
missionary
journals
of
immense
length
came
home
and
were
duly
published
and
then
the
details
of
hindu
idolatry
and
cruelty
and
impurity
and
the
tremendous
obstacles
to
the
gospel
were
better
known
by
the
few
regular
readers
much
that
miss
carmichael
tells
was
then
told
over
and
over
again
though
not
perhaps
with
a
skilful
pen
like
hers
but
the
work
has
so
greatly
developed
in
each
mission
and
the
missions
are
so
far
more
numerous
and
extended
that
neither
can
missionaries
now
write
as
their
predecessors
did
nor
if
they
did
could
all
the
missionary
periodicals
together
find
space
for
their
journals
the
fault
of
incorrect
impressions
lies
mainly
in
the
want
of
knowledge
and
want
of
thought
of
home
speakers
and
preachers
i
remember
thirty
years
ago
an
eloquent
bishop
in
exeter
hall
triumphantly
flinging
in
the
face
of
critics
of
missions
the
question
is
tinnevelly
a
fiction
as
if
tinnevelly
had
become
a
christian
country
which
apparently
some
people
still
suppose
it
to
be
notwithstanding
the
warning
words
to
the
contrary
which
the
publications
have
again
and
again
uttered
even
now
there
are
in
tinnevelly
about
twenty
heathen
to
every
one
christian
and
of
what
sort
the
twenty
are
this
book
tells
tinnevelly
is
indeed
no
fiction
but
in
a
very
different
sense
from
that
of
the
good
bishop
speech
again
a
few
months
ago
i
heard
a
preacher
not
very
favourable
to
the
say
that
the
despite
its
shortcomings
deserved
well
of
the
church
because
it
had
converted
a
nation
in
uganda
as
if
the
nation
comprised
only
souls
some
day
the
actual
of
uganda
will
be
better
understood
and
the
inevitable
shortcomings
of
even
its
christian
population
realised
and
then
we
shall
be
told
that
we
deceived
the
public
although
we
have
warned
them
over
and
over
again
but
the
larger
part
of
this
book
is
a
revelation
so
far
as
is
possible
of
the
actual
of
hinduism
and
caste
god
grant
that

about
the
book
we
can
do
nothing
against
the
truth
but
for
the
truth
paul
asia
and
there
is
too
little
desire
to
know
what
is
the
actual
state
of
mission
work
in
india
and
a
regard
to
the
showy
and
attractive
rather
than
to
the
solid
and
practical
i
will
try
however
to
avoid
being
carried
away
by
the
tide
and
to
set
myself
the
task
of
giving
as
plain
and
unvarnished
a
statement
as
possible
of
what
is
actually
being
done
or
not
done
in
the
great
field
of
our
foreign
labour
french
india
and
three
friends
sat
native
fashion
on
the
floor
of
an
indian
verandah
two
of
the
three
had
come
out
to
india
for
a
few
months
to
see
the
fight
as
it
is
and
they
saw
it
they
now
proposed
that
the
third
should
gather
some
letters
written
from
the
hot
heart
of
things
and
make
them
into
a
book
to
the
intent
that
others
should
see
exactly
what
they
had
seen
the
third
was
not
sure
the
world
has
many
books
does
it
want
another
and
especially
another
of
the
kind
this
one
would
be
brain
and
time
are
needed
for
all
that
writing
a
book
means
the
third
has
not
much
of
either
but
the
two
undertook
to
do
all
the
most
burdensome
part
of
the
business
give
us
the
letters
we
will
make
the
book
and
they
urged
reasons
which
ended
in
this
this
the
book
has
tried
to
tell
the
truth
that
is
all
it
has
to
say
about
itself
the
quotations
which
head
the
chapters
and
which
are
meant
to
be
read
not
skipped
are
more
worthful
than
anything
else
in
it
they
are
chosen
from
the
writings
of
missionaries
who
saw
the
truth
and
who
told

she
struck
the
tamil
mind
the
pictures
she
caught
were
not
easy
to
catch
reserved
and
conservative
india
considered
the
camera
intrusive
and
we
were
often
foiled
in
getting
what
we
most
desired
even
where
we
were
allowed
to
catch
our
object
peaceably
it
was
a
case
of
working
under
difficulties
which
would
have
daunted
a
less
ardent
wherever
the
camera
was
set
up
there
swarms
of
children
sprang
into
being
burrowed
in
and
out
like
rabbits
and
scuttled
about
over
everything
to
the
confusion
of
the
poor
artist
who
had
to
fix
focus
and
look
after
the
safety
of
her
camera
legs
at
the
same
time
while
the

missie

held
an
umbrella
over

speedily
got
restive

so
much

mere
mechanical
finally
i
should
explain
the
book
character
tell
about
things
as
they
actually
are
so
said
the
two
with
emphasis
i
tried
but
the
actual
eluded
me
it
was
as
if
one
painted
smoke
and
then
pointing
to
the
feeble
blur
said
look
at
the
battle
smoking
hell

battle
there
is

the
poet
thought
was
not
this
i
know
when
she
coined
that
suggestive
phrase
the
dust
of
the
actual
but
it
has
been
the
predominating
thought
in
my
mind
for
it
holds
that
which
defines
the
scope
and
expresses
the
purpose
of
the
book
and
i
use
it
as
the
title
of
one
of
the
chapters
it
does
not
show
the
actual
principalities
powers
rulers
of
the
darkness
potentialities
unknown
and
unimagined
gathered
up
into
one
stupendous
force
we
have
never
seen
it
how
can
we
describe
it
what
we
have
seen
and
tried
to
describe
is
only
an
indication
of
something
undescribed
and
is
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
it
as
dust
in
comparison
with
the
actual
the
scope
then
is
bounded
by
this
it
only
touches
the
dust
but
its
purpose
goes
deeper
stretches
wider
has
to
do
with
the
actual
and
our
relation
to
it
but
in
touching
the
dust
we
touch
the
outworkings
of
an
energy
so
awful
in
operation
that
descriptive
chapters
are
awful
too
and
such
chapters
are
best
read
alone
in
some
quiet
place
with
god
for
the
book
is
a
written
from
a
where
the
fighting
is

and

of
rock
down
on
one
side
up
on
the
other
then
both
wheels
were
sharp
aslant
but
this
is
usual
on
that
particular
first
afternoon
the
water
was
out
which
is
the
south
indian
way
of
saying
that
the
tanks
great
reservoirs
have
overflowed
and
flooded
the
land
once
we
went
smoothly
down
a
bank
and
into
a
shallow
swollen
pool
and
the
water
swished
in
at
the
lower
end
and
floated
our
books
out
quietly
so
we
had
to
stop
and
fish
them
up
and
then
huddled
close
at
the
upper
end
we
sat
somewhat
damp
but
happy
at
last
we
got
to
our
destination
reached
through
a
lane
which
then
was
a
stream
with
quite
a
swift
little
current
of
its
own
cupid
lake
the
place
is
called
we
thought
the
name
appropriate
cupid
lake
is
peopled
by
castes
of
various
persuasions
we
made
for
the
robber
quarter
first
the
robber
caste
is
honourable
here
it
furnishes
our
watchmen
and
the
coolies
who
carry
our
money
there
is
good
stuff
in
the
robber
caste
people
a
valiant
people
are
they
and
though
they
were
not
prepared
for
the
thing
that
was
coming
towards
them
they
met
it
with
fortitude
a
little
girl
saw
it
first
one
glance
at
my
hat
through
the
end
of
the
cart
and
she
flew
to
spread
the
news
oh
everyone
come
running
and
see
a
great
white
man
is
here
oh
what
an
appalling
spectacle
a
great
white
man
then
there
was
a
general
rush
children
seemed
to
spring
from
the
ground
all
eyes
and
tongues
and
astonishment
she
is
a
man
he
is
she
is
he
has
got
a
man
turban
but
look
at
her
seeley
tamil
dress
a
and
white
it
staggered
them
till
the
assurances
of
the
band
sisters
prevailed
and
they
let
me
into
a
neighbouring
house
out
of
the
sun
which
made
that
hat
a
necessity
once
it
was
off
they
lost
all
fear
and
crowded
round
in
the
friendliest
fashion
but
later
one
of
the
band
was
amused
by
hearing
me
described
in
full
not
a
man
though
great
and
white
and
wearing
a
white
turban
too
was
it
not
an
appalling
spectacle
and
the
old
body
who
was
addressed
held
up
both
her
hands
amazed
and
hastened
off
to
investigate
an
english
magazine
told
us
lately
exactly
what
these
poor
women
think
when
they
see
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
the
lady
missionary
they
greatly
admire
her
the
article
said
and
consider
her
fairer
and
more
divine
than
anything
ever
imagined
before
which
is
very
nice
indeed
to
read
but
here
what
they
say
is
this
was
it
not
an
appalling
spectacle
a
great
white
man
and
now
that
the
spectacle
was
safe
in
the
house
the
instincts
of
hospitality
urged
clean
mats
and
betel
betel
pronounced
is
the
leaf
of
a
climbing
plant
into
which
they
roll
a
morsel
of
areca
nut
and
lime
the
whole
is
made
up
into
a
parcel
and
munched
but
not
swallowed
this
does
not
sound
elegant
neither
is
the
thing
it
is
one
of
the
minor
trials
of
life
to
have
to
sit
through
the
process
we
took
a
leaf
or
two
but
explained
that
it
was
not
our
custom
to
eat
it
and
then
we
answered
questions
straight
off
for
ten
minutes
what
is
your
caste
chee
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
do
you
see
she
is
married
or
widow
why
no
jewels
what
relations
where
are
they
all
why
have
you
left
them
and
come
here
whatever
can
be
your
business
here
what
does
the
government
give
you
for
coming
here
these
last
questions
gave
us
the
chance
we
were
watching
for
and
we
began
to
explain
now
what
do
these
people
do
when
for
the
first
time
they
hear
the
good
tidings
they
simply
stare
in
that
house
that
day
there
was
an
old
woman
who
seemed
to
understand
a
little
what
it
was
all
about
she
had
probably
heard
before
but
nobody
else
understood
in
the
least
they
did
not
understand
enough
to
make
remarks
they
sat
round
us
on
the
floor
and
ate
betel
as
everybody
does
here
in
all
leisure
moments
and
they
stared
the
one
old
woman
who
seemed
to
understand
followed
us
out
of
the
house
and
remarked
that
it
was
a
good
religion
but
a
mistaken
one
as
it
advocated
or
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
caste
in
the
next
house
we
found
several
girls
and
tried
to
persuade
the
mothers
to
let
them
learn
to
read
if
a
girl
is
learning
regularly
it
gives
one
a
sort
of
right
of
entrance
to
the
house
one
going
there
is
not
so
much
observed
and
one
gets
good
chances
but
to
all
our
persuasions
they
only
said
it
was
not
their
custom
to
allow
their
girls
to
learn
had
to
do
government
work
learning
was
for
men
who
wanted
to
do
government
work
we
explained
a
little
and
mentioned
the
many
villages
where
girls
are
learning
to
read
they
thought
it
a
wholly
ridiculous
idea
then
we
told
them
as
much
as
we
could
in
an
hour
about
the
great
love
of
jesus
christ
i
was
in
the
middle
of
it
and
thinking
only
of
it
and
their
souls
when
an
old
lady
with
fluffy
white
hair
leaned
forward
and
gazed
at
me
with
a
beautiful
earnest
gaze
she
did
not
speak
she
just
listened
and
gazed
drinking
it
all
in
and
then
she
raised
a
skeleton
claw
and
grabbed
her
hair
and
pointed
to
mine
are
you
a
widow
too
she
asked
that
you
have
no
oil
on
yours
after
a
few
such
experiences
that
beautiful
gaze
loses
its
charm
it
really
means
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
sweet
expression
sometimes
observed
in
the
eyes
of
a
sorrowful
animal
but
her
question
had
set
the
ball
rolling
again
oil
no
oil
ca
you
even
afford
a
halfpenny
a
month
to
buy
good
oil
it
is
your
custom
why
not
do
any
white
ammals
ever
use
oil
what
sort
of
oil
do
the
girls
use
do
you
use
castor
oil
for
the
hair
oh
castor
oil
is
excellent
and
they
went
into
many
details
the
first
thing
they
do
when
a
baby
is
born
is
to
swing
it
head
downwards
holding
its
feet
and
advise
it
not
to
sin
and
the
second
thing
is
to
feed
it
with
castor
oil
and
put
castor
oil
in
its
eyes
do
we
do
none
of
these
things
we
sang
to
them
they
always
like
that
and
sometimes
it
touches
them
but
the
tamils
are
not
easily
touched
and
could
never
be
described
as
unduly
emotional
all
through
there
were
constant
and
various
interruptions
two
bulls
sauntered
in
through
the
open
door
and
established
themselves
in
their
accustomed
places
then
a
cow
followed
and
somebody
went
off
to
tie
the
animals
up
children
came
in
and
wanted
attention
babies
made
their
usual
noises
we
rarely
had
five
consecutive
quiet
minutes
when
they
seemed
to
be
getting
tired
of
us
we
said
the
time
was
passing
to
which
they
agreed
and
with
a
word
about
hoping
to
come
again
to
which
they
answered
cordially
oh
yes
come
we
went
out
into
the
street
and
finished
up
in
the
open
air
there
is
a
tree
at
one
end
of
the
village
we
stood
under
it
and
sang
a
chorus
and
taught
the
children
who
had
followed
us
from
house
to
house
to
sing
it
and
this
attracted
some
passing
who
listened
while
we
witnessed
unto
jesus
who
had
saved
us
and
given
us
his
joy
nothing
tells
more
than
just
this
simple
witness
to
hear
one
of
their
own
people
saying
with
evident
sincerity
one
thing
i
know
that
whereas
i
was
blind
now
i
see
makes
them
look
at
each
other
and
nod
their
heads
sympathetically
this
is
something
that
appeals
something
they
can
appreciate
many
a
time
it
arrests
attention
when
nothing
else
would
illustration
we
were
not
able
to
get
the
photo
of
that
special
girl
in
the
blue
seeley
but
this
girl
is
so
like
her
that
i
put
her
here
she
is
a
vellalar
the
jewels
worn
by
a
girl
of
this
class
run
into
thousands
of
rupees
they
are
part
of
the
ordinary
dress
this
girl
did
not
know
we
were
coming
she
was
caught
just
as
she
was
she
had
a
ball
of
pink
oleander
flowers
in
her
hands
and
white
flowers
in
her
hair
we
were
thoroughly
tired
by
this
time
and
could
neither
talk
nor
sing
any
more
the
crowd
melted
all
but
the
children
who
never
melt
one
by
one
going
their
respective
ways
having
heard
some
of
them
for
the
first
time
what
difference
will
it
make
in
their
lives
did
they
understand
it
none
of
them
seemed
specially
interested
none
of
them
said
anything
interesting
the
last
question
i
heard
was
about
soap
what
sort
of
soap
do
you
use
to
make
your
skin
white
most
of
them
would
far
prefer
to
be
told
that
secret
than
how
to
get
a
white
heart
afternoon
number
two
found
us
in
the
village
of
the
temple
a
little
place
but
a
very
citadel
of
pride
and
the
arrogance
of
ignorance
we
did
not
know
that
at
first
of
course
but
we
very
soon
found
it
out
there
was
the
usual
skirmish
at
the
sight
of
a
live
white
woman
no
one
there
had
seen
such
a
curiosity
but
even
curiosity
could
not
draw
the
brahmans
they
live
in
a
single
straggling
street
and
would
not
let
us
in
go
said
a
fat
old
brahman
disdainfully
no
white
man
has
ever
trodden
our
street
and
no
white
woman
shall
as
for
that
child
with
you
victory
looked
up
in
her
gentle
way
and
he
varied
it
to
that
child
who
eats
with
those
people
she
shall
not
speak
to
one
of
our
women
go
by
the
way
you
have
come
this
was
not
encouraging
we
salaamed
and
departed
and
went
to
our
bandy
left
outside
bandies
are
not
allowed
to
drive
down
brahman
streets
and
asked
our
master
to
open
another
door
while
we
were
waiting
a
tall
hindu
came
and
said
will
you
come
to
my
house
i
will
show
you
the
way
so
we
went
he
led
us
to
the
vellala
quarter
next
to
the
brahmans
and
we
found
his
house
was
the
great
house
of
the
place
the
outer
door
opened
into
a
large
square
inner
courtyard
a
wide
verandah
supported
by
pillars
quaintly
carved
ran
round
it
the
women
rooms
low
and
windowless
opened
on
either
side
these
are
the
rooms
we
rejoice
to
get
into
and
now
we
were
led
right
in
but
first
i
had
to
talk
to
the
men
they
were
regular
caste
hindus
courteous
for
they
have
had
no
cause
to
fear
the
power
of
the
gospel
yet
keen
and
argumentative
one
of
them
had
evidently
read
a
good
deal
he
quoted
from
their
classics
knew
all
about
besant
and
the
latest
pervert
to
her
views
and
was
up
in
the
bewildering
tangle
of
thought
known
as
hindu
philosophy
of
doubt
in
blinding
eddies
drifted
that
is
what
it
really
is
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
prove
it
so
one
truth
struck
him
especially
christianity
is
the
only
religion
which
provides
a
way
by
which
there
is
deliverance
from
sin
there
is
a
certain
system
of
philosophy
which
professes
to
provide
deliverance
in
the
future
when
the
soul
having
passed
through
the
first
three
stages
of
bliss
loses
its
identity
and
becomes
absorbed
in
god
but
there
is
no
way
by
which
deliverance
can
be
obtained
here
and
now
sin
shall
not
have
dominion
over
you
there
is
no
such
line
as
this
in
all
the
million
stanzas
of
the
hindu
classics
he
admitted
this
freely
admitted
that
this
one
tenet
marked
out
christianity
as
a
unique
religion
but
he
did
not
go
on
further
he
showed
no
desire
to
prove
the
truth
of
it
after
this
they
let
us
go
to
the
women
who
had
all
this
time
been
watching
us
and
discussing
us
with
interest
once
safely
into
their
inner
room
we
sat
down
on
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
them
and
began
to
make
friends
there
was
a
grandmother
who
had
heard
that
white
people
were
not
white
all
over
but
piebald
so
to
speak
might
she
examine
me
there
were
several
matronly
women
who
wanted
to
know
what
arrangements
english
parents
made
concerning
their
daughters
marriages
there
were
the
usual
widows
of
a
large
indian
household
one
always
looks
at
them
with
a
special
longing
and
there
was
a
dear
young
girl
in
a
soft
blue
seeley
tamil
dress
her
ears
clustered
about
with
pearls
and
her
neck
laden
with
five
or
six
necklets
worth
some
hundreds
of
rupees
she
was
going
to
be
married
and
beyond
the
usual
gentle
courtesy
of
a
tamil
girl
showed
no
interest
in
us
almost
all
the
women
had
questions
to
ask
on
the
track
it
is
different
they
have
already
satisfied
their
lawful
curiosity
concerning
missie
ammals
but
here
they
have
not
had
the
chance
and
if
we
ignore
their
desires
we
defeat
our
own
they
may
seem
to
listen
but
they
are
really
occupied
in
wondering
about
us
we
got
them
to
listen
finally
and
left
them
cheered
by
warm
invitations
to
return
then
we
thought
of
the
poor
proud
brahmans
and
hoping
that
perhaps
in
the
interval
they
had
inquired
about
us
and
would
let
us
in
we
went
to
them
again
we
could
see
the
fair
faces
and
slender
forms
of
the
younger
brahman
women
standing
in
the
shadow
behind
their
verandah
pillars
and
some
of
them
looked
as
if
they
would
like
to
let
us
in
but
the
street
had
not
relented
and
a
brahman
street
is
like
a
house
you
can
not
go
in
unless
you
are
allowed
there
was
one
courtly
old
man
and
he
seemed
to
sympathise
with
us
for
he
left
the
mocking
group
of
men
and
came
to
see
us
off
and
then
as
if
to
divert
us
from
the
greater
topic
he
pointed
to
one
of
the
mountains
a
spur
of
the
god
king
mountain
famous
in
all
south
india
and
volunteered
to
tell
me
its
story
we
were
glad
to
make
friends
with
him
even
over
so
small
a
thing
as
a
mountain
but
he
would
speak
of
nothing
else
and
when
he
left
us
we
felt
baffled
and
sorry
and
tired
with
the
tiredness
that
comes
when
you
can
not
give
your
message
and
we
sat
down
on
a
rock
outside
the
brahman
street
to
wait
till
the
band
sisters
gathered
for
the
homeward
walk
it
was
sunset
time
and
the
sky
was
overcast
by
dull
grey
clouds
but
just
over
the
brahman
quarter
there
was
a
rift
in
the
grey
and
the
gold
shone
through
it
seemed
as
if
god
were
pouring
out
his
beauty
upon
those
brahmans
trying
to
make
them
look
up
and
they
would
not
one
by
one
we
saw
them
go
to
their
different
courtyards
where
the
golden
glow
could
not
reach
them
and
we
heard
them
shut
their
great
heavy
doors
as
if
they
were
shutting
him
out
in
there
it
was
dark
out
here
out
with
god
it
was
light
the
that
loveliest
glow
of
the
east
was
shining
through
the
rent
of
the
clouds
and
the
roofs
and
the
scarlet
flowers
of
the
flame
of
the
forest
and
every
tint
and
colour
which
would
respond
in
any
way
were
aglow
with
the
beauty
of
it
the
brahman
quarter
was
set
in
the
deep
green
of
shadowy
trees
just
behind
it
the
mountains
rose
outlined
in
mist
and
out
of
the
mist
a
waterfall
gleamed
white
against
blue
we
spent
afternoon
number
three
in
the
village
of
the
warrior
a
lonely
little
place
left
all
by
itself
on
a
great
rough
moorland
if
you
can
call
a
patch
of
bare
land
moor
which
is
destitute
of
heather
and
grows
palms
and
scrub
in
clumps
instead
it
took
us
rather
a
long
time
to
get
to
it
over
very
broken
ground
on
a
very
hot
day
but
when
we
did
get
there
we
found
such
a
good
opening
that
we
forgot
about
our
feelings
and
entered
in
rejoicing
there
were
some
little
children
playing
at
the
entrance
to
the
village
and
they
led
us
straight
to
their
own
house
making
friends
in
the
most
charming
way
as
they
trotted
along
beside
us
they
told
us
their
family
history
and
we
told
them
as
much
of
ours
as
was
necessary
and
they
introduced
us
to
their
mothers
as
old
acquaintances
the
mothers
were
indulgent
and
let
us
have
a
room
all
to
ourselves
in
the
inner
courtyard
where
a
dozen
or
more
children
gathered
and
listened
with
refreshing
zest
understood
dear
little
things
though
so
often
their
elders
did
not
then
the
mothers
got
interested
and
sat
about
the
door
the
girls
were
with
me
we
usually
divide
into
two
parties
the
elder
and
more
experienced
sisters
go
off
in
one
direction
and
the
young
come
with
me
and
before
long
jewel
of
victory
was
telling
out
of
a
full
heart
all
about
the
great
things
god
had
done
for
her
she
has
a
very
sweet
way
with
the
women
and
they
listened
fascinated
then
the
others
spoke
and
still
those
women
listened
they
were
more
intelligent
than
our
audience
of
yesterday
and
though
they
did
not
follow
nearly
all
they
listened
splendidly
to
the
of
our
message
in
the
meaning
as
is
often
the
case
their
interest
was
simply
nil
but
we
were
sorry
and
i
think
so
were
they
when
a
commotion
outside
disturbed
us
and
we
were
sorrier
when
we
knew
the
cause
the
village
postman
who
only
visits
these
places
once
a
week
had
appeared
with
a
letter
for
the
head
of
the
house
one
of
the
men
folk
had
read
it
it
told
of
the
death
of
the
son
in
foreign
parts
madras
i
think
and
the
poor
old
mother
one
desire
was
to
see
us
out
of
the
room
she
had
not
liked
to
turn
us
out
but
as
the
news
spread
more
women
gathered
clamouring
round
the
door
and
the
moment
we
left
the
room
empty
in
they
rushed
with
the
mother
and
the
women
who
had
listened
to
us
and
flinging
themselves
on
the
floor
cried
the
tamil
cry
of
sorrow
full
of
a
pathos
of
its
own
it
was
sad
to
leave
them
crying
so
but
at
that
moment
we
were
certainly
better
away
the
children
came
with
us
to
the
well
outside
the
village
and
we
sat
on
its
wall
and
went
on
with
our
talk
they
would
hardly
let
us
go
and
begged
us
to
come
back
and
teach
them
every
day
not
the
gospel
do
not
imagine
their
little
hearts
craved
for
that
but
reading
and
writing
and
sums
as
we
drove
off
some
of
the
villagers
smiled
and
salaamed
and
the
little
children
last
words
followed
us
as
far
as
we
could
hear
them
come
back
soon
sometimes
as
now
when
we
come
to
a
new
place
we
dream
a
dream
dream
that
perhaps
at
last
it
may
be
possible
to
win
souls
peacefully
perhaps
these
courteous
kindly
people
will
welcome
the
message
we
bring
them
when
they
understand
it
better
perhaps
homes
need
not
be
broken
up
perhaps
whole
families
will
believe
or
individual
members
believing
may
still
live
in
their
own
homes
and
witness
there
perhaps
perhaps
and
snatches
of
verse
float
through
our
dream
oh
might
some
sweet
song
thy
lips
have
taught
us
some
glad
song
and
sweet
guide
amidst
the
mist
and
through
the
darkness
lost
ones
to
thy
feet
it
sounds
so
beautiful
so
easy
singing
souls
to
jesus
and
we
dream
our
dream
till
suddenly
and
with
violence
we
are
awakened
someone
a
mere
girl
or
a
lad
or
even
a
little
child
has
believed
has
confessed
wants
to
be
a
christian
and
the
whole
caste
is
roused
and
the
whole
countryside
joins
with
the
caste
and
the
people
we
almost
thought
loved
us
hate
us
and
till
we
go
to
the
next
new
place
we
never
dream
that
dream
again

humdrum
a
missionary
life
is
more
ordinary
than
is
supposed
plod
rather
than

is
often
the
best
missionary
equipment
heywood
horsburgh
truly
to
understand
the
facts
of
work
for
christ
in
any
land
we
must
strip
it
of
all
romance
and
of
everything
which
is
unreal
hewlett
there
have
been
times
of
late
when
i
have
had
to
hold
on
to
one
text
with
all
my
might
it
is
required
in
stewards
that
a
man
be
found
praise
god
it
does
not
say
successful
one
evening
things
came
to
a
climax
we
all
spent
a
whole
afternoon
without
getting
one
good
listener
we
separated
as
usual
going
two
and
two
to
the
different
quarters
of
a
big
sleepy
straggly
village
life
and
i
went
to
the
potters
life
spoke
most
earnestly
and
well
to
an
uninterested
group
of
women
after
she
had
finished
one
of
them
pointed
to
my
hat
the
only
foreign
thing
about
me
which
was
visible
oh
that
i
could
dispense
with
it
what
is
that
she
said
not
one
bit
did
they
care
to
hear
one
by
one
they
went
back
to
their
work
and
we
were
left
alone
we
went
to
another
quarter
it
was
just
the
same
at
a
by
the
way
i
noticed
a
brahman
and
went
to
see
if
he
would
listen
he
would
if
i
would
talk
about
politics
or
education
but
not
if
it
was
about
religion
however
i
did
get
a
chance
of
pleading
with
him
to
consider
the
question
of
his
soul
salvation
and
he
took
a
book
and
said
he
would
read
it
at
his
leisure
and
then
he
asked
me
how
many
persons
i
had
succeeded
in
joining
to
my
way
since
i
began
to
try
it
was
exactly
the
question
only
asked
in
another
form
which
the
devil
had
been
pressing
on
me
all
the
afternoon
after
this
he
told
me
politely
that
we
were
knocking
our
heads
against
a
rock
we
might
smash
our
heads
but
we
never
would
affect
the
rock
rock
rock
when
wilt
thou
open
it
is
an
old
cry
i
cried
it
afresh
but
the
brahman
only
smiled
and
then
with
a
gesture
expressing
at
once
his
sense
of
his
own
condescension
in
speaking
with
me
and
his
utter
contempt
for
the
faith
i
held
motioned
to
me
to
go
outside
in
the
road
a
number
of
hindus
were
standing
some
of
them
were
his
retainers
and
friends
i
heard
them
say
as
i
passed
through
their
midst
who
will
fall
into
the
pit
of
the
christian
way
and
they
laughed
and
the
brahman
laughed
as
the
filth
of
the
world
the
offscouring
of
all
things
unto
this
day
we
walked
along
the
road
bordered
with
beautiful
banyan
trees
we
sat
down
under
their
shade
and
waited
for
what
would
come
some
little
children
followed
us
but
before
we
could
get
a
single
idea
clearly
into
their
heads
a
man
came
and
chased
them
away
it
is
getting
dark
he
said
they
are
only
little
green
things
they
must
not
be
out
late
it
was
broad
daylight
then
and
would
be
for
another
hour
some
coolies
passing
that
way
stopped
to
look
at
us
but
before
they
had
time
to
get
interested
they
too
remarked
that
darkness
was
coming
and
they
must
be
off
and
off
they
went
we
were
left
alone
after
that
within
five
minutes
walk
were
at
least
five
hundred
souls
redeemed
but
they
do
know
it
redeemed
they
do
want
to
know
sometimes
they
seem
to
want
to
know
but
however
tenderly
you
tell
it
the
keen
hindu
mind
soon
perceives
the
drift
of
it
all
redemption
must
mean
loss
of
caste
one
day
last
week
i
was
visiting
in
the
village
of
the
red
lake
standing
in
one
of
its
courtyards
you
see
the
western
ghauts
rising
straight
up
behind
the
red
lake
lies
at
the
mountain
foot
we
call
it
derwentwater
but
there
are
palms
and
bamboos
and
there
is
no
friar
crag
that
afternoon
i
was
bound
for
a
house
in
the
centre
of
the
village
when
an
old
lady
called
me
to
come
to
her
house
and
i
followed
her
gladly
there
were
six
or
eight
women
all
more
or
less
willing
to
listen
among
them
were
two
who
were
very
old
old
people
in
india
are
usually
too
attached
to
their
own
faith
or
too
utterly
stupid
and
dull
to
care
to
hear
about
another
but
this
old
lady
had
been
stirred
to
something
almost
like
active
thought
by
the
recent
death
of
a
relative
and
she
felt
that
she
needed
something
more
than
she
had
to
make
her
ready
for
death
she
was
apparently
devout
ashes
were
marked
on
her
brow
and
arms
and
she
wore
a
very
large
rosary
it
is
worn
to
accumulate
merit
i
did
not
refer
to
it
as
i
talked
but
in
some
dim
way
she
seemed
to
feel
it
did
not
fit
with
what
i
was
saying
for
with
trembling
hands
she
took
it
off
and
threw
it
to
a
child
i
hoped
this
meant
something
definite
and
tried
to
lead
her
to
jesus
but
as
soon
as
she
understood
who
he
was
she
drew
back
i
can
not
be
a
disciple
of
your
guru
here
she
said
would
my
relations
bear
such
defilement
being
a
christian
really
meant
sooner
or
later
leaving
her
home
and
all
her
people
for
ever
can
you
wonder
an
old
lady
of
perhaps
stopped
at
that
the
little
children
in
the
village
of
the
warrior
are
not
allowed
to
learn
the
men
of
the
place
have
consulted
and
come
to
the
decision
the
chill
of
it
has
struck
the
little
ones
and
they
do
not
care
to
run
the
chance
of
the
scolding
they
would
receive
if
they
showed
too
much
interest
in
us
the
mothers
are
as
friendly
as
ever
but
indifferent
we
hear
this
is
a
religion
which
spoils
our
caste
they
say
and
that
is
the
end
of
it
in
the
great
house
of
the
temple
village
they
listened
well
for
some
weeks
then
as
it
gradually
opened
to
them
that
there
is
no
caste
whatever
in
christianity
their
interest
died
how
much
one
would
like
to
tell
a
different
story
but
a
story
is
one
thing
and
a
story
of
facts
is
another
so
far
we
have
only
found
two
genuine
earnest
souls
here
but
if
those
two
go
on
praise
god
for
the
joy
on
before
we
went
again
to
the
potters
village
and
sat
on
the
narrow
verandah
and
talked
to
a
girl
as
she
patted
the
pots
into
shape
underneath
where
the
wheel
had
left
an
open
place
she
listened
for
awhile
then
she
said
if
i
come
to
your
way
will
you
give
me
a
new
seeley
and
good
curry
every
day
and
back
again
we
went
to
the
very
beginning
of
things
while
the
old
grandfather
spinning
his
wheel
chuckled
at
us
for
our
folly
in
wasting
our
time
over
potters
as
if
would
ever
turn
to
your
religion
he
said
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
potter
who
changed
his
caste
caste
and
religion
they
are
so
mixed
up
that
we
do
not
know
how
to
unmix
them
his
caste
to
the
potter
meant
his
trade
the
trade
of
his
clan
for
generations
it
meant
all
the
observances
bound
up
with
it
it
meant
in
short
his
life
it
would
never
strike
him
that
he
could
be
a
christian
and
a
potter
at
the
same
time
and
very
probably
he
could
not
the
feeling
of
the
caste
would
be
against
it
then
what
else
could
he
be
he
does
not
argue
all
this
out
he
does
not
care
enough
about
the
matter
to
take
the
trouble
to
think
at
all
he
has
only
one
concern
in
life
he
lives
to
make
pots
and
sell
them
and
make
more
and
sell
them
and
so
eat
and
sleep
in
peace
but
the
girl
had
the
look
of
more
possibility
she
asked
questions
and
seemed
interested
and
finally
suggested
we
should
wait
till
she
had
finished
her
batch
of
pots
and
then
she
would
tell
us
all
her
mind
so
we
waited
and
watched
the
deft
brown
hands
as
they
worked
round
the
gaping
hole
till
it
grew
together
and
closed
and
at
last
she
had
finished
then
she
drew
us
away
from
the
group
of
curious
children
and
told
us
if
we
would
come
in
three
days
she
would
be
prepared
to
join
our
way
and
come
with
us
for
she
had
to
work
very
hard
at
home
and
her
food
was
poor
and
her
seeley
old
and
she
thought
it
would
be
worth
risking
the
wrath
of
her
people
to
get
all
she
knew
we
should
give
her
if
she
came
and
this
was
all
her
mind
she
had
touched
a
great
perplexity
how
are
we
to
live
in
india
without
raising
desires
of
this
sort
it
is
true
the
brahmans
look
down
upon
us
and
the
higher
castes
certainly
do
not
look
up
but
to
the
greater
number
of
the
people
we
seem
rich
and
grand
and
desirable
to
cultivate
the
is
a
fact
in
south
india
we
may
banish
things
from
our
tables
and
all
pictures
and
ornaments
from
our
walls
and
confine
ourselves
to
texts
this
certainly
helps
there
is
less
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
people
when
they
come
to
see
us
and
we
have
so
many
the
fewer
things
to
take
care
of
a
very
great
advantage
but
it
does
not
go
far
towards
disillusioning
them
as
to
what
they
imagine
is
our
true
position
we
are
still
up
above
to
them
not
on
a
level
not
one
of
themselves
the
houses
we
live
in
are
airy
and
large
and
they
do
not
understand
the
need
of
protection
from
the
sun
the
food
we
eat
is
abundant
and
good
and
to
them
it
looks
luxurious
for
they
live
on
rice
and
vegetable
curry
at
a
cost
of
twopence
a
day
our
walls
may
be
bare
but
they
are
clean
and
the
texts
aforesaid
are
not
torn
at
the
corners
so
whatever
we
say
we
are
rich
identification
with
the
people
whom
we
have
come
to
win
is
the
aim
of
many
a
missionary
but
the
difficulty
always
is
the
same
climate
and
customs
are
dead
against
it
how
can
we
do
it
george
bowen
struck
at
english
life
and
became
a
true
indian
so
far
as
he
could
but
even
he
could
not
go
all
the
way
no
matter
how
far
you
may
go
there
is
always
a
distance
you
can
not
cover
yards
or
inches
it
may
be
but
always
that
fatal
hiatus
we
seem
so
undeniably
up
far
up
above
them
in
everything
and
we
want
to
get
to
the
lowest
step
down
low
enough
down
to
lift
lost
souls
up
illustration
i
went
down
to
the
potter
house
and
behold
he
wrought
a
work
on
the
wheels
the
vessel
the
potters
are
making
here
is
worth
about
a
halfpenny
but
it
is
perfect
of
its
kind
the
moulder
never
lifts
his
hand
from
it
from
the
moment
he
puts
a
lump
of
shapeless
clay
on
the
wheel
till
the
moment
he
takes
it
off
finished
so
far
as
the
wheel
can
finish
it
if
it
is
marred
it
is
marred
the
of
the
potter
and
instantly
he
makes
it
again
another
vessel
as
it
seems
good
to
him
he
never
wastes
the
clay
on
and
on
if
they
will
let
us
time
after
time
by
text
and
hymn
and
story
we
have
to
explain
what
things
really
mean
before
they
are
able
to
understand
even
a
fraction
of
the
truth
the
fact
that
this
girl
had
thought
enough
to
get
her
ideas
into
shape
was
encouraging
and
with
such
slender
cause
for
hope
we
still
hoped
but
when
after
some
visiting
she
began
to
see
that
the
question
was
not
one
of
curries
and
seeleys
but
of
inward
invisible
gifts
her
interest
died
and
she
was
out
when
we
went
or
too
busy
patting
her
pots
to
have
time
to
listen
to
us
humdrum
we
have
called
the
work
and
humdrum
it
is
there
is
nothing
romantic
about
potters
except
in
poetry
nor
is
there
much
of
romance
about
missions
except
on
platforms
and
in
books
yet
though
it
dull
at
whiles
there
is
joy
in
the
doing
of
it
there
is
joy
in
just
obeying
he
said
go
tell
and
we
have
come
and
are
telling
and
we
meet
him
as
we
go
and
tell
but
dear
friends
do
not
we
entreat
you
expect
to
hear
of
us
doing
great
things
as
an
everyday
matter
of
course
our
aim
is
great
it
is
for
and
before
the
gods
in
possession
here
we
sing
songs
unto
him
but
what
we
say
to
you
is
this
do
not
expect
every
true
story
to
dovetail
into
some
other
true
story
and
end
with
some
marvellous
coincidence
or
miraculous
conversion
most
days
in
real
life
end
exactly
as
they
began
so
far
as
visible
results
are
concerned
we
do
not
find
as
a
rule
when
we
go
to
the
houses
the
literal
little
mud
houses
i
mean
of
literal
heathendom
that
anyone
inside
has
been
praying
we
might
come
i
read
a
missionary
story
founded
on
fact
the
other
day
and
the
things
that
happened
in
that
story
on
these
lines
were
most
remarkable
they
do
not
happen
here
practical
missionary
life
is
an
unexciting
thing
it
is
not
sparkling
all
over
with
incident
it
is
very
prosaic
at
times
chapter
iv
correspondences
it
is
very
pleasant
when
you
are
in
england
and
you
see
souls
being
saved
and
you
see
the
conviction
of
sin
and
you
see
the
power
of
the
gospel
to
bring
new
life
and
new
joy
and
purity
to
hearts
but
it
is
still
more
glorious
amongst
the
heathen
to
see
the
same
things
to
see
the
lord
there
working
his
own
work
of
salvation
and
to
see
the
souls
convicted
and
the
hearts
broken
and
to
see
there
the
new
life
and
the
new
joy
coming
out
in
the
faces
of
those
who
have
found
the
lord
jesus
barclay
buxton
before
putting
this
chapter
together
i
have
looked
long
at
the
photograph
which
fronts
it
the
longer
one
looks
the
more
pitiful
it
seems
perhaps
one
reads
into
it
all
that
one
knows
of
her
all
one
has
done
for
her
how
one
has
failed
and
this
makes
it
sadder
than
it
may
be
to
other
eyes
and
yet
can
it
fail
to
be
sad
hood
lines
reversed
describe
her
all
that
is
left
of
her
now
is
not
womanly
the
day
we
took
her
photo
she
was
returning
from
her
morning
worship
at
the
shrine
she
had
poured
her
libation
over
the
idol
walked
round
and
round
it
prostrated
herself
before
it
gone
through
the
prayers
she
had
learned
off
by
heart
and
now
was
on
her
way
home
illustration
a
saivite
ascetic
siva
represents
the
severer
side
of
hinduism
the
powers
of
nature
which
destroy
but
as
all
disintegrated
things
are
reintegrated
in
some
other
form
the
two
powers
destruction
and
reconstruction
were
united
in
the
thought
of
the
old
hindus
and
siva
represents
the
double
power
the
saivite
form
of
hinduism
is
older
than
the
vaishnavite
and
more
widely
spread
over
india
there
are
said
to
be
symbols
of
the
god
siva
scattered
about
the
land
saivites
are
instantly
recognised
by
the
mark
of
white
ashes
on
their
foreheads
and
sometimes
on
the
breast
and
arms
and
often
a
necklet
of
berries
is
worn
we
had
gone
to
her
village
to
take
photographs
and
had
just
got
the
street
scene
in
the
morning
light
the
crowd
followed
us
eager
to
see
more
of
the
doings
of
the
box
and
she
fearing
the
defiling
touch
of
the
mixed
castes
represented
there
had
climbed
up
on
a
granite
slab
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
stood
waiting
till
we
passed
there
we
saw
her
and
there
we
took
her
for
to
our
surprise
she
did
not
object
and
now
here
she
is
to
show
with
all
the
force
of
truth
how
far
from
ideal
the
real
may
be
we
looked
at
her
as
i
look
at
her
now
stripped
of
all
god
meant
her
to
have
when
he
made
her
deep
in
the
mire
of
the
lowest
form
of
idolatry
a
devotee
of
siva
she
had
been
to
benares
and
bathed
in
the
sacred
ganges
and
therefore
she
is
holy
beyond
the
reach
of
doubt
she
has
no
room
for
any
sense
of
the
need
of
christ
she
pities
our
ignorance
when
we
talk
to
her
is
she
not
a
devotee
has
she
not
been
to
benares
often
and
often
we
meet
her
in
the
houses
of
the
place
where
she
is
always
an
honoured
guest
because
of
her
wonderful
sanctity
she
watches
keenly
then
lest
any
of
the
younger
members
of
the
household
should
incline
to
listen
to
us
one
of
her
relatives
is
an
lawyer
a
bitter
though
covert
foe
who
not
long
ago
stirred
up
such
opposition
that
we
were
warned
not
to
go
near
the
place
men
had
been
hired
to
fall
upon
us
and
beat
us
this
because
a
girl
a
connection
of
his
read
her
bible
openly
instead
of
in
secret
as
she
had
done
before
he
connected
this
action
on
her
part
with
a
visit
we
had
paid
to
the
house
and
so
induced
certain
of
the
baser
sort
to
do
this
thing
we
went
however
just
the
same
as
we
had
work
we
had
promised
to
do
and
saw
the
old
gentleman
sitting
on
the
verandah
reading
his
english
newspaper
in
the
most
pacific
fashion
he
seemed
surprised
to
see
us
as
we
passed
with
a
salaam
we
saw
nothing
of
the
beaters
and
returned
with
whole
bones
to
the
relief
of
the
community
at
large
only
i
remember
one
of
our
band
was
woefully
disappointed
i
thought
perhaps
we
were
going
to
be
martyrs

lake
village
an
ordinary
typical
village
scene
except
that
just
then
there
were
more
people
than
usual
before
the
box
the
only
way
to
keep
them
from
crowding
round
it
was
to
show
them
something
else
this
explains
the
group
on
the
stones
at
the
side
and
so
we
realise
as
so
often
in
india
the
power
of
both
extremes
the
one
with
all
the
force
of
his
education
and
the
other
with
all
the
force
of
her
superstition
each
uniting
with
the
other
in
repelling
the
coming
of
the
saviour
both
equally
need
as
one
looks
at
the
photograph
does
it
not
help
in
the
effort
to
realise
the
utter
hopelessness
from
every
human
point
of
view
of
trying
to
win
such
a
one
for
example
to
even
care
to
think
of
christ
there
is
over
and
above
the
natural
apathy
common
to
all
an
immense
barrier
of
accumulated
merit
gained
by
pilgrimages
austerities
and
religious
observances
and
the
soul
is
perfectly
satisfied
and
has
no
desire
whatever
after
god
it
is
just
this
which
makes
it
so
hopeless
to
try
to
do
anything
with
it
and
yet
nothing
is
hopeless
to
god
set
no
borders
to
his
strength
a
japanese
missionary
said
we
say
it
over
and
over
again
to
ourselves
in
the
face
of
some
great
hopelessness
like
that
photograph
before
us
and
sometimes
as
if
to
assure
us
it
is
so
god
lifts
some
such
soul
into
light
just
now
we
are
rejoicing
in
a
letter
from
the
eastern
side
of
the
district
telling
us
of
the
growth
in
the
new
life
of
one
who
only
a
little
while
ago
was
a
temple
devotee
one
has
often
longed
to
see
him
work
as
he
worked
of
old
healing
the
sick
by
the
word
of
his
power
raising
the
dead
but
when
we
see
him
gathering
one
and
such
a
one
from
among
the
heathen
to
give
thanks
unto
his
holy
name
and
to
triumph
in
his
praise
one
feels
that
indeed
it
is
a
miracle
of
miracles
and
that
greater
than
a
miracle
wrought
on
the
body
is
a
miracle
wrought
on
the
soul
but
nothing
i
can
write
can
show
you
the
miracle
it
was
in
that
particular
case
it
was
like
seeing
a
soul
drawn
out
of
the
hand
of
the
ruler
of
darkness
all
salvation
is
that
in
reality
but
sometimes
as
in
her
case
when
the
whole
environment
of
the
soul
has
been
strongly
for
evil
in
its
most
dangerous
phase
then
it
is
more
evidently
so
perhaps
we
should
explain
we
know
that
in
its
widest
sense
environment
simply
means
all
that
is
we
know
that
all
that
is
includes
the
existence
of
certain
beings
described
as
powers
in
ephesians
vi
some
of
us
are
more
or
less
unconscious
of
this
part
of
our
environment
we
have
no
conscious
correspondence
with
it
but
it
is
there
others
again
seek
and
find
such
correspondence
to
their
certain
and
awful
loss
such
a
subject
can
hardly
bear
handling
in
language
thank
god
we
know
so
little
about
it
that
we
do
not
know
how
to
speak
of
it
accurately
neither
indeed
do
we
wish
to
intrude
into
those
things
which
we
have
not
seen
by
any
attempt
at
close
definition
but
we
know
there
is
this
unhallowed
correspondence
between
men
and
demons
which
in
old
days
drew
down
as
a
lightning
conductor
the
flash
of
the
wrath
of
god
here
in
india
it
exists
we
often
almost
touch
it
but
not
quite
we
would
not
go
where
we
knew
we
should
see
it
even
if
we
might
so
unless
we
happen
upon
it
which
is
rare
we
never
see
it
at
all
a
year
ago
i
saw
it
and
that
one
look
made
me
realise
as
no
amount
of
explanations
ever
could
how
absolutely
out
of
reach
of
all
human
influence
such
souls
are
can
reach
them
nothing
but
the
might
of
the
holy
ghost
so
i
close
with
this
one
look
will
you
pray
for
those
to
whom
in
the
moonless
night
at
the
altar
by
the
temple
there
is
the
sudden
coming
of
that
which
they
have
sought
the
possession
the
afflatus
which
for
ever
after
marks
them
out
as
those
whose
correspondences
reach
beyond
mortal
ken
all
devotees
have
not
received
this
awful
baptism
but
in
this
part
of
india
many
have
we
were
visiting
in
a
house
the
walls
were
decorated
with
mythological
devices
and
even
the
old
were
full
of
idolatrous
symbols
the
women
were
listening
well
asking
questions
and
arguing
until
one
an
old
lady
came
in
then
they
were
silent
she
sat
down
and
discussed
us
we
thought
we
would
change
the
subject
and
we
began
to
sing
she
listened
as
they
always
do
interrupting
only
to
say
that
true
that
true
till
suddenly
i
can
not
describe
what
something
seemed
to
come
over
her
and
she
burst
into
a
frenzy
exclaiming
let
me
sing
let
me
sing
and
then
she
sang
as
i
never
heard
anyone
sing
before
the
wildest
weirdest
wail
of
a
song
all
about
idolatry
its
uselessness
and
folly
its
sorrow
and
sin
so
far
i
followed
her
for
i
knew
the
poem
well
but
she
soon
turned
off
into
regions
of
language
and
thought
unreached
as
yet
by
me
here
she
got
madly
excited
and
swaying
herself
to
and
fro
seemed
lashing
herself
into
fury
nearer
and
nearer
she
drew
to
us
we
were
on
the
floor
beside
her
then
she
stretched
out
her
arm
with
its
clenched
fist
and
swung
it
straight
for
my
eye
within
a
she
drew
back
and
struck
out
for
victory
but
god
helped
her
not
to
flinch
then
i
can
not
tell
what
happened
only
her
form
dilated
and
she
seemed
as
if
she
would
spring
upon
us
but
as
if
she
were
somehow
held
back
we
dare
not
move
for
fear
of
exciting
her
more
there
we
sat
for
i
know
not
how
long
with
this
awful
old
woman
clenched
fist
circling
round
our
heads
or
all
but
striking
into
our
eyes
while
without
intermission
she
crooned
her
song
in
that
hollow
hum
that
works
upon
the
listener
till
the
nerve
of
the
soul
is
drawn
out
as
it
were
to
its
very
farthest
stretch
it
was
quite
dark
by
this
time
only
the
yellow
flicker
of
the
flame
of
the
lamp
made
uncertain
lights
and
shadows
round
the
place
where
we
were
sitting
and
an
eerie
influence
fell
on
us
all
almost
mesmeric
in
effect
i
did
not
need
the
awestruck
whispers
round
me
to
tell
me
what
it
was
but
oh
i
felt
as
i
never
felt
before
the
reality
of
the
presence
of
unseen
powers
and
i
knew
that
the
actual
itself
was
in
the
room
with
me
at
last
she
fell
back
exhausted
trembling
in
every
limb
her
old
head
hit
the
wall
as
she
fell
but
i
knew
we
must
not
help
her
it
would
be
pollution
to
her
if
we
touched
her
the
people
all
round
were
too
frightened
to
move
so
she
fell
and
lay
there
quivering
her
glittering
eyes
still
fixed
on
us
and
she
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
softly
we
stole
away
and
we
felt
we
had
been
very
near
where
seat
is
think
of
someone
you
love
as
i
did
then
of
someone
whose
hair
is
white
like
hers
but
the
face
you
think
of
has
peace
in
it
and
god
light
lightens
it
then
think
of
her
as
we
saw
her
last
the
old
face
torn
with
the
fury
of
hell
and
for
light
the
darkness
thereof
oh
friends
do
you
care
enough
do
we
care
enough
out
here
god
give
us
hearts
that
can
care
chapter
v
the
prey
of
the
terrible
i
believe
we
are
in
the
midst
of
a
great
battle
we
are
not
ourselves
fighting
we
are
simply
accepting
everything
that
comes
but
the
powers
of
light
are
fighting
against
the
powers
of
darkness
and
they
will
certainly
prevail
the
holy
spirit
is
working
but
the
people
do
not
as
yet
know
it
is
the
spirit
needham
the
devil
favourite
device
just
now
is
to
move
interested
people
to
places
we
have
had
several
who
seemed
very
near
to
the
kingdom
then
suddenly
they
have
disappeared
there
was
wreath
of
the
village
of
the
temple
she
used
to
listen
in
the
shadow
of
the
door
while
we
sat
on
the
outside
verandah
then
she
got
bolder
and
openly
asked
to
see
golden
and
talk
with
her
one
day
unexpectedly
golden
was
led
to
the
red
lake
village
and
to
her
surprise
found
wreath
there
she
had
been
sent
away
from
the
village
of
the
temple
and
was
now
with
some
other
relations
under
even
stricter
guard
but
god
led
golden
all
unknowingly
to
go
straight
to
the
very
house
where
she
was
so
she
heard
again
next
time
golden
went
she
could
not
see
her
alone
but
somehow
wreath
got
her
to
understand
that
if
she
went
to
a
certain
tree
near
the
women
at
a
certain
time
next
week
she
would
try
to
meet
her
there
golden
went
and
they
met
wreath
told
her
she
believed
it
all
but
she
could
not
then
face
breaking
caste
and
destroying
her
family
name
they
had
been
good
to
her
how
could
she
disgrace
them
still
she
eagerly
wanted
to
go
on
hearing
and
we
felt
that
if
she
did
the
love
of
god
would
win
so
we
were
full
of
hope
next
time
golden
went
she
could
find
no
trace
of
her
she
has
never
seen
her
since
there
is
a
rumour
that
she
has
been
carried
off
over
the
mountains
hundreds
of
miles
away
in
another
village
a
bright
keen
boy
of
seventeen
listened
one
day
when
we
taught
the
women
and
becoming
greatly
interested
openly
took
the
gospel
part
when
the
village
elders
attacked
it
after
some
weeks
he
gathered
courage
to
come
and
see
the
iyer
he
was
a
very
intelligent
boy
well
known
all
over
the
countryside
because
he
had
studied
the
tamil
classics
and
also
because
of
his
connection
with
one
of
the
chief
temples
of
the
district
a
fortnight
after
his
visit
here
our
band
went
to
his
village
they
heard
that
he
was
married
and
gone
where
no
one
would
say
the
relations
must
have
heard
of
his
coming
to
us
of
course
he
was
urged
to
tell
them
and
they
rushed
him
through
a
marriage
and
sent
him
off
post
haste
so
now
there
is
another
key
turned
locking
him
into
hinduism
in
the
village
of
the
wind
a
young
girl
became
known
as
an
inquirer
her
caste
passed
the
word
along
from
village
to
village
wherever
its
members
were
found
and
all
these
relations
and
connections
were
speedily
leagued
in
a
compact
to
keep
her
from
hearing
more
when
we
went
to
see
her
we
found
she
had
been
posted
off
somewhere
else
when
we
went
to
the
somewhere
else
always
freely
mentioned
to
us
with
invitations
to
go
we
found
she
had
been
there
but
had
been
forwarded
elsewhere
for
weeks
she
was
tossed
about
like
this
then
we
traced
her
and
found
her
but
she
was
thoroughly
cowed
and
dared
not
show
the
least
interest
in
us
it
is
often
like
that
just
at
the
point
where
the
is
so
delicate
that
the
lightest
touch
affects
it
something
someone
pushes
it
roughly
and
it
trembles
a
moment
then
falls
on
the
wrong
side
the
reason
for
all
this
alertness
of
opposition
is
that
scattered
about
the
five
thousand
square
miles
we
call
our
field
here
and
there
seeds
are
beginning
to
grow
some
of
the
sowers
are
in
england
now
and
some
are
in
heaven
sowers
and
reapers
english
and
tamil
rejoice
together
this
is
known
everywhere
for
the
news
spreads
from
town
to
town
and
then
out
to
the
villages
and
the
result
is
opposition
sometimes
the
little
patch
of
ground
which
looked
so
hopeful
is
trampled
and
the
young
seedlings
killed
sometimes
they
seem
to
be
rooted
up
when
we
go
to
our
master
and
tell
him
he
explains
it
an
enemy
hath
done
this
but
as
the
measure
of
the
enemy
activity
is
in
direct
proportion
to
the
measure
of
god
working
we
take
it
as
a
sign
of
encouragement
however
hindering
it
may
be
satan
would
not
trouble
to
fight
if
he
saw
nothing
worth
attacking
he
does
not
seem
to
mind
the
spread
of
a
head
knowledge
of
the
doctrine
or
even
a
cordial
appreciation
of
it
often
we
hear
the
people
say
how
excellent
it
is
and
how
they
never
worship
idols
now
but
only
the
true
god
and
even
a
heathen
mother
will
make
her
child
repeat
its
texts
to
you
and
a
father
will
tell
you
how
it
tells
him
bible
stories
and
if
you
are
quite
new
to
the
work
you
put
it
in
the
and
at
home
it
sounds
like
conversion
all
this
goes
on
most
peacefully
there
is
not
the
slightest
stir
till
something
happens
to
show
the
people
that
the
doctrine
is
not
just
a
creed
but
contains
a
living
power
and
then
and
not
till
then
there
is
opposition
this
opposition
is
sufficiently
strong
in
the
case
of
a
boy
or
young
man
older
caste
men
and
women
rarely
change
their
religion
in
this
part
of
south
india
but
if
a
girl
is
in
question
the
caste
is
touched
at
its
most
sensitive
point
and
the
feeling
is
simply
intense
men
and
demons
seem
to
conspire
to
hold
such
a
one
in
the
clutch
of
the
terrible
there
is
a
young
girl
in
cupid
lake
village
whose
heart
the
lord
opened
some
weeks
ago
she
is
a
gentle
timid
girl
and
devoted
to
her
mother
can
it
be
right
to
break
my
mother
heart
she
used
to
ask
us
pitifully
we
urged
her
to
try
to
win
her
mother
but
the
mother
was
just
furious
the
moment
she
understood
that
her
daughter
wanted
to
follow
jesus
or
join
the
way
as
she
would
express
it
she
gathered
the
girl
books
and
burnt
them
and
forbade
her
ever
to
mention
the
subject
and
she
went
all
round
the
villages
trying
to
stop
our
work
at
last
things
came
to
a
crisis
the
girl
was
told
to
do
what
she
felt
would
be
sin
against
god
she
refused
they
tried
force
sheer
brute
force
she
nerved
herself
for
the
leap
in
the
dark
and
tried
to
escape
to
us
but
in
the
dark
night
she
lost
the
way
and
had
to
run
back
to
her
home
next
morning
the
village
priest
spread
a
story
to
the
effect
that
his
god
had
appeared
to
him
told
him
of
her
attempt
to
escape
and
that
she
would
try
twice
again
but
each
time
i
will
stand
in
the
way
and
turn
her
back
he
said
this
naturally
startled
the
girl
is
his
god
stronger
than
jesus
she
asked
in
real
perplexity
we
told
her
we
thought
the
tale
was
concocted
to
frighten
her
the
priest
had
seen
her
and
made
up
the
rest
but
twice
since
then
driven
by
dire
danger
that
girl
has
tried
to
get
to
us
and
each
time
she
has
been
turned
back
and
now
she
is
kept
in
rigorous
guard
as
her
determination
to
be
a
christian
is
well
known
to
all
in
the
place
do
you
say
tell
her
to
stay
at
home
and
bear
it
patiently
we
do
tell
her
so
when
we
can
see
her
but
we
add
till
god
makes
a
way
of
escape
and
if
you
knew
all
there
is
to
be
known
about
a
hindu
home
and
what
may
happen
in
it
you
would
not
tell
her
otherwise
but
supposing
there
is
nothing
more
than
negative
difficulty
to
be
feared
have
you
ever
tried
in
thought
to
change
places
with
such
a
girl
have
you
ever
considered
how
impossible
it
is
for
such
a
one
to
grow
the
simple
grace
of
continuance
is
in
danger
of
withering
when
all
help
of
every
sort
is
absolutely
cut
off
and
the
soul
is
to
begin
with
not
deeply
rooted
in
god
plants
even
when
they
have
life
need
water
and
sunshine
and
air
babes
need
milk
you
find
it
hard
enough
to
grow
if
one
may
judge
from
the
constant
wails
about
leanness
and
yet
you
are
surrounded
by
every
possible
help
to
growth
you
have
a
whole
bible
not
just
a
scrap
of
it
and
you
can
read
it
all
and
understand
at
least
most
of
it
you
have
endless
good
books
and
spiritual
papers
you
have
sermons
every
week
numerous
meetings
for
edification
and
perhaps
an
annual
convention
now
strip
yourself
of
all
this
shut
your
bible
and
forget
as
completely
as
if
you
had
never
known
it
all
you
ever
read
or
heard
except
the
main
facts
of
the
gospel
forget
all
those
strengthening
verses
all
those
beautiful
hymns
all
those
inspiring
addresses
likewise
of
course
entirely
forget
all
the
loving
dealings
of
god
with
yourself
and
with
others
a
hindu
has
no
such
memories
to
help
her
then
go
and
live
in
a
devil
den
and
develop
saintliness
the
truth
is
even
you
would
find
it
difficult
but
this
hindu
girl
case
is
worse
than
that
a
million
times
worse
think
of
the
life
and
then
if
you
can
tell
her
she
must
be
quite
satisfied
with
it
that
it
is
the
will
of
god
you
could
not
say
that
it
is
his
will
it
is
the
will
of
the
terrible
who
holds
on
to
his
prey
and
would
rather
rend
it
limb
from
limb
than
ever
let
it
go
we
are
often
asked
to
tell
converts
stories
and
certainly
they
would
thrill
for
the
way
of
escape
god
opens
sometimes
is
like
peter
from
prison
miraculous
and
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
and
far
more
interesting
but
we
who
work
in
the
terrible
lair
and
know
how
he
fights
to
get
back
his
prey
even
after
it
has
escaped
from
him
are
afraid
to
tell
these
stories
too
much
and
feel
that
silence
is
safest
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
some
for
the
present
most
glorifies
god
for
a
certain
connection
has
been
observed
between
publicity
and
peril
and
we
have
learned
by
experience
to
fear
any
attempt
to
photograph
spiritual
fruit
the
old
greek
artist
turned
away
the
face
that
held
too
much
for
him
to
paint
and
that
face
had
power
in
it
they
say
to
touch
men
hearts
we
turn
these
faces
away
from
you
may
the
very
fact
that
we
do
it
teach
some
at
home
to
realise
how
much
more
lies
in
each
of
them
than
we
can
say
how
great
a
need
there
is
to
pray
that
each
may
be
kept
safe
the
names
of
one
and
another
occur
because
they
came
in
the
letters
so
often
that
i
could
not
cross
them
all
out
without
altering
the
character
of
the
whole
they
are
part
of
one
very
life
but
as
even
a
passing
mention
may
mean
danger
unless
a
counteracting
influence
of
real
prayer
protects
them
we
ask
you
to
pray
that
the
tender
protection
of
god
may
be
folded
round
each
one
of
them
and
then
when
we
meet
where
no
sin
can
creep
into
the
telling
and
no
harm
can
follow
it
they
will
tell
you
their
stories
themselves
and
god
will
give
you
your
share
in
the
joy
comrades
by
prayer
at
home
but
let
us
press
it
on
you
now
pray
oh
pray
for
the
converts
pray
that
they
may
grow
in
christ
pray
that
he
may
see
of
the
travail
of
his
soul
and
be
satisfied
with
each
of
them
and
pray
that
we
may
enter
into
that
travail
of
soul
with
him
nothing
less
is
any
good
spiritual
children
mean
travail
of
soul
spiritual
agony
i
wonder
who
among
those
who
read
this
will
realise
what
i
mean
some
will
i
think
so
i
write
it
it
is
a
solemn
thing
to
find
oneself
drawn
out
in
prayer
which
knows
no
relief
till
the
soul
it
is
burdened
with
is
born
it
is
no
less
solemn
afterwards
until
christ
is
formed
in
them
converts
are
a
responsible
joy
and
now
we
have
told
you
a
little
of
what
is
going
on
there
are
days
when
nothing
seems
to
be
done
and
then
again
there
are
days
when
the
terrible
seems
almost
visible
as
he
gathers
up
his
strength
and
tears
and
mauls
his
prey
and
so
it
is
true
we
have
to
fight
a
separate
fight
for
each
soul
but
another
view
of
the
case
is
a
strength
to
us
many
a
time
we
are
not
ourselves
fighting
but
the
powers
of
light
are
fighting
against
the
powers
of
darkness
and
the
coming
of
the
victory
is
only
a
question
of
time
shall
the
prey
be
taken
from
the
mighty
or
the
captives
of
the
terrible
be
delivered
but
thus
saith
the
lord
the
captives
of
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
and
the
prey
of
the
terrible
shall
be

if
you
could
only
know
what
one
feels
on
finding
oneself
where
the
least
ray
of
the
gospel
has
not
penetrated
if
those
friends
who
blame
could
see
from
afar
what
we
see
and
feel
what
we
feel
they
would
be
the
first
to
wonder
that
those
redeemed
by
christ
should
be
so
backward
in
devotion
and
know
so
little
of
the
spirit
of

would

of
the
hesitations
that
hinder

must
remember
that
it
was
not
by
interceding
for
the

glory
that
jesus

he

our
prayers
for
the
evangelisation
of
the
world
are
but
a
bitter
irony
so
long
as
we

of

henry
watson
fox
the
thumped
straight
on
all
night
and
the
darkness
shuddered
round
me
like
a
living
feeling
thing
i
could
not
go
to
sleep
so
i
lay
awake
and
looked
and
i
saw
as
it
seemed
this
that
i
stood
on
a
grassy
sward
and
at
my
feet
a
precipice
broke
sheer
down
into
infinite
space
i
looked
but
saw
no
bottom
only
cloud
shapes
black
and
furiously
coiled
and
great
hollows
and
unfathomable
depths
back
i
drew
dizzy
at
the
depth
then
i
saw
forms
of
people
moving
single
file
along
the
grass
they
were
making
for
the
edge
there
was
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
another
little
child
holding
on
to
her
dress
she
was
on
the
very
verge
then
i
saw
that
she
was
blind
she
lifted
her
foot
for
the
next
step
it
trod
air
she
was
over
and
the
children
over
with
her
oh
the
cry
as
they
went
over
then
i
saw
more
streams
of
people
flowing
from
all
quarters
all
were
blind
stone
blind
all
made
straight
for
the
precipice
edge
there
were
shrieks
as
they
suddenly
knew
themselves
falling
and
a
tossing
up
of
helpless
arms
catching
clutching
at
empty
air
but
some
went
over
quietly
and
fell
without
a
sound
then
i
wondered
with
a
wonder
that
was
simply
agony
why
no
one
stopped
them
at
the
edge
i
could
not
i
was
glued
to
the
ground
and
i
could
not
call
though
i
strained
and
tried
only
a
whisper
would
come
then
i
saw
that
along
the
edge
there
were
sentries
set
at
intervals
but
the
intervals
were
far
too
great
there
were
wide
unguarded
gaps
between
and
over
these
gaps
the
people
fell
in
their
blindness
quite
unwarned
and
the
green
grass
seemed
to
me
and
the
gulf
yawned
like
the
mouth
of
hell
then
i
saw
like
a
little
picture
of
peace
a
group
of
people
under
some
trees
with
their
backs
turned
towards
the
gulf
they
were
making
daisy
chains
sometimes
when
a
piercing
shriek
cut
the
quiet
air
and
reached
them
it
disturbed
them
and
they
thought
it
a
rather
vulgar
noise
and
if
one
of
their
number
started
up
and
wanted
to
go
and
do
something
to
help
then
all
the
others
would
pull
that
one
down
why
should
you
get
so
excited
about
it
you
must
wait
for
a
definite
call
to
go
you
have
finished
your
daisy
chains
yet
it
would
be
really
selfish
they
said
to
leave
us
to
finish
the
work
alone
there
was
another
group
it
was
made
up
of
people
whose
great
desire
was
to
get
more
sentries
out
but
they
found
that
very
few
wanted
to
go
and
sometimes
there
were
no
sentries
set
for
miles
and
miles
of
the
edge
once
a
girl
stood
alone
in
her
place
waving
the
people
back
but
her
mother
and
other
relations
called
and
reminded
her
that
her
furlough
was
due
she
must
not
break
the
rules
and
being
tired
and
needing
a
change
she
had
to
go
and
rest
for
awhile
but
no
one
was
sent
to
guard
her
gap
and
over
and
over
the
people
fell
like
a
waterfall
of
souls
once
a
child
caught
at
a
tuft
of
grass
that
grew
at
the
very
brink
of
the
gulf
it
clung
convulsively
and
it
called
but
nobody
seemed
to
hear
then
the
roots
of
the
grass
gave
way
and
with
a
cry
the
child
went
over
its
two
little
hands
still
holding
tight
to
the
bunch
of
grass
and
the
girl
who
longed
to
be
back
in
her
gap
thought
she
heard
the
little
one
cry
and
she
sprang
up
and
wanted
to
go
at
which
they
reproved
her
reminding
her
that
no
one
is
necessary
anywhere
the
gap
would
be
well
taken
care
of
they
knew
and
then
they
sang
a
hymn
then
through
the
hymn
came
another
sound
like
the
pain
of
a
million
broken
hearts
wrung
out
in
one
full
drop
one
sob
and
a
horror
of
great
darkness
was
upon
me
for
i
knew
what
it
was
the
cry
of
the
blood
then
thundered
a
voice
the
voice
of
the
lord
he
said
what
hast
thou
done
the
voice
of
thy
brothers
blood
crieth
unto
me
from
the
the
still
beat
heavily
the
darkness
still
shuddered
and
shivered
about
me
i
heard
the
yells
of
the
and
the
weird
wild
shriek
of
the
just
outside
the
gate
what
does
it
matter
after
all
it
has
gone
on
for
years
it
will
go
on
for
years
why
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
god
forgive
us
god
arouse
us
shame
us
out
of
our
callousness
shame
us
out
of
our
sin
one
afternoon
a
few
weeks
after
that
night
at
the
precipice
edge
victory
and
i
were
visiting
in
the
red
lake
village
when
we
heard
the
of
the
and
the
shriek
of
the
conch
shell
and
we
knew
that
another
had
gone
beyond
our
reach
one
can
never
get
accustomed
to
this
we
stopped
for
a
moment
and
listened
the
women
we
were
teaching
broke
in
with
eager
explanations
oh
he
was
such
a
great
one
he
had
received
the
initiation
there
will
be
a
grand
ceremonial
grander
than
ever
you
have
then
they
told
us
how
this
great
one
had
been
initiated
into
the
hindu
mysteries
by
his
family
priest
and
that
the
mystical
benefits
accruing
from
this
initiation
were
to
be
caused
to
revert
to
the
priest
this
reverting
of
the
initiation
was
to
be
one
of
the
ceremonies
we
watched
the
procession
pass
down
the
street
they
were
going
for
water
from
a
sacred
stream
for
the
bathing
of
purification
when
they
return
said
the
women
the
ceremonies
will
begin
a
little
later
we
passed
the
house
and
stood
looking
in
through
the
doorway
there
was
the
usual
large
square
courtyard
with
the
verandah
running
round
three
sides
the
verandah
was
full
of
women
we
longed
to
go
in
but
did
not
think
they
would
let
us
the
courtyard
was
rather
confused
men
were
rushing
about
putting
up
arches
and
decorating
them
servants
were
sweeping
and
cooking
and
shouting
to
one
another
the
women
were
talking
and
laughing
and
all
the
time
from
within
the
house
came
the
sound
of
the
dirge
for
the
dead
and
the
laugh
and
the
wail
struck
against
each
other
and
jarred
no
one
noticed
us
for
awhile
but
at
last
a
woman
saw
us
and
beckoned
us
to
come
we
are
all
defiled
you
may
sit
with
us
they
said
and
yielding
to
the
instincts
of
their
kindly
tamil
nature
they
crushed
closer
together
to
make
room
for
us
beside
them
how
i
did
enjoy
being
squeezed
up
there
among
them
but
to
appreciate
that
in
the
least
you
would
have
to
work
in
a
part
of
old
india
you
can
have
no
idea
until
you
try
how
hard
it
is
to
refrain
from
touching
those
whom
you
love
the
house
door
opened
upon
the
verandah
and
we
could
hear
the
moan
of
the
dirge
there
is
sorrow
on
the
sea
it
can
not
be
quiet
there
was
no
quietness
only
the
ceaseless
moan
that
kept
rising
into
a
wail
there
were
tears
in
the
sound
of
the
wail
and
i
felt
like
a
sort
of
living
harp
with
all
its
strings
drawn
tight
but
the
women
outside
cared
nothing
at
all
it
was
strange
to
see
how
callous
they
were
it
was
not
their
who
had
died
so
they
chatted
and
laughed
and
watched
the
proceedings
the
tying
of
the
garlands
round
the
arches
the
arrangement
of
offerings
for
the
brahmans
it
was
all
full
of
interest
to
them
we
tried
to
turn
their
thoughts
to
the
powers
of
the
world
to
come
but
no
they
did
not
care
presently
there
was
a
stir
the
men
are
coming
they
said
run
there
is
a
shady
corner
under
those
palms
on
the
far
verandah
run
and
hide
they
are
here
and
even
as
they
spoke
in
streamed
the
men
each
with
his
brass
poised
on
his
head
and
they
saw
us
standing
there
we
thought
they
would
turn
us
out
and
were
quite
prepared
to
go
at
a
sign
from
the
head
of
the
clan
but
he
was
a
friend
of
ours
and
he
smiled
as
we
salaamed
and
pointed
to
a
quiet
corner
out
of
the
way
where
we
could
see
it
all
without
being
too
much
seen
to
understand
this
which
to
me
was
a
surprise
one
must
remember
that
by
nature
the
indian
is
most
courteous
and
if
it
were
not
for
caste
rules
we
should
be
allowed
to
come
much
closer
to
them
than
is
possible
now
they
were
all
ceremonially
unclean
so
our
presence
was
not
considered
polluting
also
the
indian
loves
a
function
sad
or
glad
it
matters
little
life
is
a
bubble
on
the
water
enjoy
it
while
you
may
and
they
sympathised
with
what
they
thought
was
our
desire
to
see
the
show
this
was
human
they
could
understand
it
so
they
let
us
stay
and
we
stayed
hoping
for
a
chance
later
on
then
the
ceremonies
began
they
carried
the
dead
man
out
and
laid
him
in
the
courtyard
under
the
arch
of
palms
he
was
old
and
worn
and
thin
one
could
see
the
fine
old
face
with
the
marks
of
the
hindu
trident
painted
down
the
forehead
he
had
been
a
most
earnest
hindu
all
the
rites
were
duly
performed
and
morning
and
night
for
many
years
he
had
marked
those
marks
on
his
brow
had
he
ever
once
listened
to
the
truth
i
do
not
know
he
must
have
heard
about
it
but
he
had
not
received
it
he
died
they
told
us
not
knowing
what
lay
on
the
other
side
the
laid
their
vessels
on
the
ground
each
had
a
leaf
across
its
mouth
the
priest
was
crowned
with
a
chaplet
of
flowers
then
came
the
bathing
they
threw
up
a
shelter
and
carried
him
there
it
was
reverently
done
there
was
a
touch
of
refinement
in
the
thought
which
banished
the
women
and
children
before
the
bathing
began
tamils
bathe
in
the
open
air
and
always
clothed
but
always
apart
and
as
the
women
verandah
overlooked
the
screened
enclosure
they
were
all
ordered
off
they
went
and
waited
silent
now
awed
by
the
presence
of
the
men
while
the
bathing
was
going
on
the
priests
chanted
and
muttered
incantations
and
now
and
again
a
bell
was
rung
and
incense
waved
and
tapers
lighted
now
they
were
causing
that
mysterious
something
which
still
hovered
round
the
lifeless
form
to
leave
it
and
return
to
them
and
when
the
bathing
was
over
they
signified
that
all
was
done
the
influence
had
departed
descended
the
funeral
ceremonies
might
proceed
and
all
this
time
without
a
break
the
dirge
was
being
sung
by
the
mourners
in
the
house
it
was
a
sort
of
undernote
to
all
the
sounds
outside
then
the
old
man
robed
in
white
and
crowned
and
wreathed
with
flowers
was
carried
round
to
the
other
side
and
oh
the
pitifulness
of
it
all
paul
must
have
been
thinking
of
some
such
scene
when
he
wrote
to
the
converts
that
ye
sorrow
not
even
as
others
which
have
no
hope
and
i
thought
how
strangely
callous
we
were
how
superficial
our
sympathy
the
lord
command
does
not
stir
us
the
sorrow
of
those
we
neglect
does
not
touch
us
we
think
so
much
more
of
ourselves
and
our
own
selfish
pleasure
than
we
think
of
the
purpose
for
which
we
were
saved
and
at
such
a
tremendous
cost
oh
for
a
baptism
of
reality
and
obedience
to
sweep
over
us
oh
to
be
true
to
the
hymns
we
sing
and
the
vows
we
make
make
us
forgive
all
this
it
was
burnt
into
me
afresh
that
day
as
i
sat
there
watching
the
things
they
did
and
listening
to
what
they
said
we
had
come
too
late
for
that
old
dead
man
too
late
for
most
of
the
living
ones
too
can
you
wonder
if
at
such
solemn
times
one
yields
oneself
afresh
and
for
ever
to
obey
rice
was
prepared
for
the
dead
man
use
and
balls
of
rice
were
ready
to
be
offered
to
his
spirit
after
his
cremation
for
the
hindus
think
that
an
intermediate
body
must
be
formed
and
nourished
which
on
the
thirteenth
day
after
death
is
conducted
to
either
heaven
or
hell
according
to
the
deeds
done
on
earth
the
ceremonies
were
all
characterised
by
a
belief
in
some
future
state
the
spirit
was
somewhere
in
the
dark
so
they
tried
to
light
the
way
for
him
this
reminds
me
of
one
ceremony
especially
suggestive
all
the
little
grandchildren
were
brought
and
lighted
tapers
given
to
them
then
they
processioned
round
the
bier
round
and
round
many
times
holding
the
tapers
steadily
and
looking
serious
and
impressed
then
the
widow
came
out
with
a
woman
on
either
side
supporting
her
and
she
walked
round
and
round
her
husband
with
the
tears
rolling
down
her
face
and
she
wailed
the
widow
wail
with
her
very
heart
in
it
why
had
he
gone
away
and
left
her
desolate
his
was
the
spirit
of
fragrance
like
the
scented
his
was
the
arm
of
strength
like
the
lock
that
barred
the
door
gone
was
the
scent
of
the
sandal
broken
and
open
the
door
why
had
the
bird
flown
and
left
but
the
empty
cage
gone
was
he
gone
was
he
really
gone
was
it
certain
he
was
dead
he
who
had
tossed
and
turned
on
the
softest
bed
they
could
make
must
he
lie
on
the
bed
of
his
funeral
pyre
must
he
burn
upon
logs
of
wood
say
was
there
no
way
to
reach
him
no
way
to
help
him
now
i
have
searched
for
thee
but
i
find
thee
not
and
so
the
dirge
moaned
on
i
could
not
hear
all
this
then
victory
told
it
to
me
and
much
more
afterwards
last
time
i
heard
it
she
said
i
was
wailing
too
as
the
poor
widow
went
round
and
round
she
stopped
each
time
she
got
to
the
feet
and
embraced
them
fervently
sometimes
she
broke
through
all
restraint
and
clasped
him
in
her
arms
illustration
a
photo
rarely
possible
the
dead
woman
lies
in
her
bier
the
white
on
her
eyes
and
brow
is
the
mark
of
siva
ashes
some
of
the
mourners
are
so
marked
as
they
are
all
saivites
the
fire
is
lighted
from
the
pot
of
fire
to
the
right
just
before
it
is
lighted
the
chief
mourner
takes
a
vessel
of
water
pierces
a
hole
in
it
walks
round
the
dead
letting
the
water
trickle
out
pierces
another
hole
and
repeats
the
walk
after
the
third
piercing
and
walk
he
throws
the
pot
backwards
over
his
shoulder
and
as
it
smashes
the
water
all
splashes
out
this
is
to
refresh
the
spirit
if
it
should
be
thirsty
while
its
body
is
being
burned
after
many
ceremonies
had
been
performed
the
men
all
went
away
and
the
women
were
left
to
bid
farewell
to
the
form
soon
to
be
carried
out
then
the
men
came
back
and
bore
him
across
the
courtyard
and
paused
under
the
arch
outside
while
the
women
all
rushed
out
tearing
their
hair
and
beating
themselves
and
wailing
wildly
as
they
were
lifting
the
bier
to
depart
the
cry
was
stop
stop
will
he
not
speak
and
this
chanted
again
and
again
would
have
made
the
coldest
care
then
when
all
was
over
and
the
long
procession
headed
by
the
and
conch
shells
had
passed
out
of
sight
the
women
pressed
in
again
and
each
first
let
down
her
hair
and
seized
her
nearest
neighbour
and
they
all
flung
themselves
on
the
ground
and
knocked
their
heads
against
it
and
then
rising
to
a
sitting
posture
they
held
on
to
one
another
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
and
chanting
in
time
to
the
swaying
in
chorus
and
antiphone
all
this
even
to
the
and
was
copied
by
the
children
who
were
present
with
terrible
fidelity
we
sat
down
among
them
they
took
our
hands
and
rocked
us
in
the
orthodox
way
but
we
did
not
wail
and
we
did
not
undo
our
hair
we
tried
to
speak
comforting
words
to
those
who
were
really
in
grief
but
we
found
it
was
not
the
time
a
fortnight
later
we
went
again
and
found
the
house
door
open
because
we
had
been
with
them
that
day
but
we
could
not
help
them
then
so
we
rose
and
were
going
away
when
held
by
the
power
of
that
dirge
of
theirs
i
turned
to
look
again
the
last
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
were
lighting
up
the
courtyard
and
shining
on
the
masses
of
black
hair
and
grey
as
i
looked
they
got
up
one
by
one
and
put
their
disordered
dress
to
rights
and
shook
out
the
dust
from
their
glossy
hair
and
did
it
up
again
and
one
by
one
without
farewell
of
any
sort
they
went
away
an
hour
later
we
met
groups
of
them
coming
home
from
bathing
they
would
not
touch
us
then
afterwards
the
chief
mourners
came
out
and
bathed
and
went
all
round
the
village
wailing
and
the
last
thing
i
saw
as
the
sun
set
over
the
hills
and
the
place
grew
chill
and
dark
was
the
old
widow
worn
out
now
returning
home
in
her
wet
things
wailing
still
i
write
this
under
a
sense
of
the
solemnity
of
being
a
servant
separated
unto
the
gospel
i
would
not
write
one
word
lightly
but
oh
may
i
ask
you
to
face
it
are
we
honest
towards
god
if
we
were
would
these
people
be
left
to
die
as
they
are
being
left
to
die
we
feel
for
them
feelings
will
not
save
souls
it
cost
god
calvary
to
win
will
cost
us
as
much
as
we
may
know
of
the
fellowship
of
his
sufferings
if
those
for
whom
he
died
that
day
are
ever
to
be
i
am
writing
in
the
midst
of
the
sights
and
the
sounds
of
life
there
is
life
in
the
group
of
women
at
the
well
life
in
the
voices
in
the
splash
of
the
water
in
the
cry
of
a
child
in
the
call
of
the
mother
life
in
the
flight
of
the
parrots
as
they
flock
from
tree
to
tree
life
in
their
chatter
as
they
quarrel
and
scream
life
everywhere
life
how
can
i
think
out
of
all
this
back
into
death
again
but
i
want
to
for
you
may
live
for
many
a
year
in
india
without
being
allowed
to
see
once
what
we
have
seen
twice
within
two
months
and
it
can
not
be
for
nothing
that
we
saw
it
we
must
be
meant
to
show
it
to
you
illustration
this
needs
to
be
looked
into
gradually
the
middle
clears
the
women
are
holding
each
other
hands
preparatory
to
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
as
they
chant
the
dirge
for
the
dead
the
lamp
you
see
its
top
near
the
vessel
on
the
right
was
lighted
as
soon
as
the
old
woman
died
and
placed
at
her
head
on
the
floor
so
blindly
they
show
their
sense
of
the
darkness
of
death
the
brass
water
vessel
with
the
leaves
laid
across
its
mouth
was
filled
with
the
water
of
purification
this
was
poured
in
a
circle
on
the
floor
round
the
body
the
bits
of
grass
are
the
sacred
kusa
grass
used
in
many
religious
ceremonies
the
missie
and
i
were
in
the
village
of
the
tamarind
tree
when
for
the
second
time
i
saw
it
they
are
very
friendly
there
and
just
as
in
the
red
lake
village
they
let
us
look
behind
the
curtain
so
here
again
they
pushed
it
back
and
let
us
in
and
went
on
with
their
business
not
minding
us
we
crouched
up
close
together
on
the
only
scrap
of
empty
space
and
watched
everything
was
less
intense
the
dead
was
only
a
poor
and
very
old
widow
who
had
lived
her
life
out
and
was
not
wanted
there
were
no
near
kindred
only
relations
by
marriage
it
was
evident
everyone
went
through
the
form
without
emotion
of
any
sort
the
woman
lay
on
a
rough
bier
on
the
floor
and
round
her
crowded
a
dozen
old
women
at
her
head
there
was
a
brass
vessel
of
water
a
some
uncooked
rice
and
some
broken
cocoanuts
just
before
we
came
in
they
had
filled
a
little
brass
vessel
from
the
larger
one
now
one
of
the
old
hags
walked
round
the
dead
three
times
pouring
the
water
out
as
she
walked
then
another
fed
her
fed
that
poor
dead
mouth
stuffed
it
in
so
roughly
it
made
us
sick
and
faint
there
were
other
things
done
hurriedly
carelessly
we
could
not
follow
them
the
last
was
the
rubbing
on
of
ashes
she
had
been
a
worshipper
of
siva
also
they
covered
the
closed
eyes
with
ashes
and
patted
them
down
flat
and
all
the
time
the
gabble
of
the
women
mocked
at
the
silence
of
death
there
was
no
reverence
no
sense
of
solemnity
the
ceremonial
so
full
of
symbol
to
its
makers
the
thinkers
of
védic
times
was
to
them
simply
a
custom
a
set
of
customs
to
be
followed
and
got
through
as
quickly
as
might
be
by
heedless
hands
and
yet
they
faithfully
carried
out
every
detail
they
knew
and
they
finished
their
heartless
work
and
called
to
the
men
to
come
the
men
were
waiting
outside
they
came
in
and
carried
her
out
it
seemed
impossible
to
think
of
a
photograph
then
it
was
most
unlikely
they
would
let
us
take
one
and
we
hardly
felt
in
the
spirit
of
yet
we
thought
of
you
and
of
how
you
certainly
could
never
see
it
unless
we
could
show
it
to
you
and
we
wanted
to
show
it
to
you
so
we
asked
them
if
we
might
of
course
if
there
had
been
real
grief
as
in
the
other
i
had
seen
we
could
not
have
asked
it
it
would
have
been
intrusion
but
here
there
was
none
was
the
pathos
of
it
and
they
were
very
friendly
so
they
put
their
burden
on
the
ground
and
waited
there
it
is
to
the
right
the
barber
stands
with
his
hanging
from
a
chain
this
is
to
light
the
funeral
pyre
the
smoke
interfered
with
the
photo
but
then
it
is
true
to
life
to
the
left
stands
the
man
with
the
shell
ready
to
blow
at
the
back
with
the
sacred
ashes
rubbed
on
forehead
and
breast
and
arms
stand
the
two
nearest
relatives
who
will
gather
the
ashes
and
throw
them
into
the
stream
the
picture
was
caught
the
man
with
the
shell
blew
it
the
man
with
the
fire
came
in
front
the
bearers
lifted
the
bier
they
went
away
with
their
dead
illustration
these
are
three
of
the
mourners
but
they
were
only
mourning
ceremonially
and
so
released
for
the
moment
from
their
duty
they
quite
enjoyed
themselves
then
the
old
women
who
had
been
pressing
through
the
open
door
rushed
back
in
the
usual
way
and
began
the
usual
rock
and
dirge
these
comparison
songs
are
always
full
of
soul
they
have
sprung
into
being
in
times
of
deepest
feeling
taken
shape
when
hearts
were
as
finely
wrought
moulds
which
left
their
impress
upon
them
and
to
hear
them
chanted
without
any
soul
is
somehow
a
pitiful
thing
a
sort
of
profanation
like
the
singing
of
sacred
words
for
pay
the
photograph
was
not
easy
to
take
the
space
was
so
confined
the
movement
so
continuous
the
commotion
so
confusing
it
was
taken
i
know
not
the
women
massed
on
the
floor
were
not
still
for
more
than
a
moment
in
that
moment
it
was
done
then
we
persuaded
three
of
them
to
risk
the
peril
of
being
caught
alone
they
would
not
move
farther
than
the
wall
of
the
house
and
as
it
was
in
a
narrow
street
again
there
were
difficulties
but
the
crowning
perplexity
was
at
the
it
was
windy
and
our
calls
were
blown
away
so
they
did
not
hear
what
we
wanted
them
to
do
and
they
splashed
too
vigorously
their
only
idea
just
then
was
to
get
themselves
and
their
garments
ceremonially
clean
defiled
as
they
were
by
contact
with
the
dead
but
let
those
six
whom
you
can
partly
see
stand
for
the
thousands
upon
thousands
whom
you
can
not
see
at
all
those
thousands
are
standing
in
water
from
the
north
to
the
uttermost
south
as
the
last
act
in
the
drama
which
they
have
played
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
the
women
have
gone
from
the
well
the
parrots
have
flown
to
other
trees
the
tamils
say
the
body
is
the
sheath
of
the
soul
i
think
of
that
empty
sheath
i
saw
and
wonder
where
the
soul
has
flown
it
has
gone
but
where
has
it
gone
home
like
the
women
from
the
well
has
it
flown
far
like
the
birds
among
the
trees
it
has
gone
it
has
gone
that
is
all
we
know
has
then
i
read
these
words
from
conybeare
and
howson
translation
if
the
tent
which
is
my
earthly
house
be
destroyed
i
have
a
mansion
built
by
god
eternal
in
the
heavens
and
herein
i
groan
with
earnest
longings
desiring
to
cover
my
earthly
raiment
with
the
robes
of
my
heavenly
mansion
he
who
has
prepared
me
for
this
very
end
is
the
dead
man
missed
his
end
that
old
dead
woman
missed
it
too
and
the
millions
around
us
still
alive
are
missing
their
end
this
very
end
think
of
it
mortality
swallowed
up
in
life
death
only
an
absence
life
for
ever
a
presence
present
with
the
lord
who
has
prepared
us
for
this
very
end
can
we
enjoy
it
all
by
ourselves
will
there
be
no
sense
of
incompleteness
if
the
many
are
outside
missing
it
all
because
they
missed
their
end
will
the
glory
make
us
glad
if
they
are
somewhere
far
away
from
it
and
god
will
not
heaven
be
almost
an
empty
place
to
one
who
has
never
tried
to
fill
it
yet
there
is
room
oh
so
much
room
for
those
we
are
meant
to
bring
in
with
us
and
there
is
room
oh
so
much

are

guard
one

those
gaps

so

burnt

the
ceremonial
bathing
they
are
all
old
women
but
the
very
oldest
old
woman
in
india
bathes
most
vigorously
after
this
bathing
is
over
they
are
purified
from
the
defilement
contracted
by
going
to
the
house
of
the
dead
chapter
vii
the
dust
of
the
actual
this
may
be
counted
as
our
richest
gain
to
have
learned
afresh
one
utter
impotency
so
completely
that
the
past
axiom
of
service
can
no
more
convert
a
soul
than
create
a
comes
to
be
an
awful
revelation
so
that
god
alone
may
be
exalted
in
that
day
walter
searle
we
have
just
come
back
from
a
pariah
village
now
see
it
all
with
me
such
a
curious
little
collection
of
huts
thrown
down
anywhere
such
faces
such
a
scurrying
in
of
some
and
out
of
others
and
we
wonder
which
house
we
had
better
make
for
we
stop
before
one
a
shade
cleaner
than
most
and
larger
and
more
open
may
we
come
in
chorus
come
in
oh
come
in
and
in
we
go
it
is
a
tiny
narrow
slip
of
a
room
at
one
end
there
is
a
fire
burning
on
the
ground
the
smoke
finds
its
way
out
through
the
roof
and
a
pot
of
rice
set
on
three
stones
is
bubbling
cheerfully
no
fear
of
defilement
here
they
would
not
like
us
to
touch
their
rice
or
to
see
them
eating
it
but
they
do
not
mind
our
being
in
the
room
where
it
is
being
cooked
at
the
other
end
of
the
narrow
slip
there
is
a
not
very
clean
and
down
one
side
there
is
a
raised
mud
place
where
the
family
apparently
sleep
this
side
and
the
two
ends
are
roofed
by
palmyra
palm
it
is
dry
and
crackles
at
a
touch
and
you
touch
it
every
time
you
stand
up
so
bits
of
it
are
constantly
falling
and
helping
to
litter
the
open
space
below
illustration
an
ancient
pariah
but
the
baby
in
her
arms
is
a
son
of
the
caste
of
palmyra
climbers
both
faces
the
old
crone
and
the
baby
boy
are
very
typical
the
baby
is
a
christian
i
should
explain
and
his
parents
are
true
christians
otherwise
the
pariah
woman
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
touch
him
five
babies
at
different
stages
of
refractoriness
are
sprawling
about
on
this
strip
of
floor
they
make
noises
all
the
time
half
a
dozen
old
women
crowd
in
through
the
low
door
and
stare
and
exchange
observations
three
young
men
with
nothing
particular
to
do
lounge
at
the
far
end
of
the
platform
near
the
goats
a
bright
girl
with
more
jewellery
on
than
is
usual
among
pariahs
is
tending
the
fire
at
the
end
near
the
door
she
throws
a
stick
or
two
on
as
we
enter
and
hurries
forward
to
get
a
mat
we
sit
down
on
the
mat
and
she
sits
beside
us
and
the
usual
questions
are
asked
and
answered
by
way
of
introduction
there
is
a
not
very
clean
old
woman
diligently
devouring
betel
another
with
an
enormous
mouth
which
she
always
holds
wide
open
another
with
a
very
loud
voice
and
a
shock
of
unspeakable
hair
but
they
listen
fairly
well
till
a
goat
creates
a
diversion
by
making
a
remark
and
a
baby
a
jolly
little
scrap
in
its
nice
brown
skin
and
a
bangle
yells
and
everyone
attention
concentrates
upon
it
the
goat
subsides
the
baby
is
now
in
its
mother
arms
so
we
go
on
where
we
left
off
and
i
watch
the
bright
young
girl
and
notice
that
she
listens
as
one
who
understands
she
looks
rather
superior
her
seeley
is
clean
and
two
large
gold
jewels
are
in
each
ear
she
has
a
little
gold
necklet
round
her
throat
and
silver
bangles
and
toe
rings
all
the
others
are
hopelessly
grubby
and
very
unenlightened
but
they
listen
just
as
most
people
listen
in
church
with
a
sort
of
patient
expression
it
is
the
proper
thing
to
do
i
am
talking
to
them
now
and
till
i
am
through
nobody
says
anything
when
suddenly
the
girl
remarks
we
have
ten
fingers
not
just
one
which
is
so
astonishing
that
i
stop
and
wonder
what
she
can
be
thinking
of
i
was
talking
about
the
one
sheep
lost
out
of
one
hundred
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
one
finger
and
ten
she
goes
on
to
explain
i
have
heard
all
this
before
i
have
a
sister
who
is
a
christian
and
once
i
stayed
with
her
and
i
heard
all
about
your
religion
and
i
felt
in
my
heart
it
was
good
but
then
i
was
married
tied
she
said
and
of
course
i
forgot
about
it
but
now
i
remember
and
i
say
if
ten
of
our
people
will
join
and
go
over
to
your
way
that
will
be
well
but
what
would
be
the
use
of
one
going
what
is
the
use
of
one
finger
moving
by
itself
it
takes
ten
to
do
the
day
work
if
ten
of
you
had
cholera
and
i
brought
you
cholera
medicine
would
you
say
wo
take
it
unless
nine
others
take
it
too
i
replied
she
laughs
and
the
others
laugh
but
a
little
uneasily
they
hardly
like
this
reference
to
the
dreaded
cholera
death
of
the
body
is
so
much
more
tremendous
in
prospect
than
death
of
the
soul
you
would
take
it
and
then
the
others
seeing
it
do
you
good
would
perhaps
take
it
too
and
we
try
to
press
home
the
point
of
the
illustration
but
a
point
pricks
and
pricking
is
uncomfortable
the
three
men
begin
to
shuffle
their
feet
and
talk
about
other
things
the
old
proposes
betel
all
round
and
hands
us
some
leaves
with
a
pressing
invitation
to
partake
the
various
onlookers
make
remarks
and
the
girl
devotes
herself
to
her
baby
but
she
is
thinking
one
can
see
old
memories
are
stirred
at
last
with
a
sigh
she
gets
up
looks
round
the
little
indifferent
group
goes
over
to
the
fireplace
and
blows
up
the
fire
this
means
we
had
better
say
salaam
so
we
say
it
and
they
say
it
adding
the
usual
go
and
come
it
will
be
easier
to
help
these
people
out
of
their
low
levels
than
it
will
be
to
help
their
masters
of
the
higher
walks
of
life
but
to
do
anything
genuine
or
radical
among
either
set
of
people
is
never
really
easy
takes
the
ideal
to
blow
a
off
the
dust
of
the
it
takes
more
it
takes
it
takes
to
do
anything
anywhere
yesterday
we
were
visiting
in
one
of
the
caste
villages
and
one
old
lady
who
really
seems
to
care
for
us
said
she
would
greatly
like
to
take
my
hand
in
hers
but
she
explained
this
morning
one
of
the
children
of
the
place
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
tank
to
drink
and
he
fell
in
and
was
drowned
so
i
have
been
to
condole
with
his
people
and
i
have
now
returned
from
bathing
and
do
not
feel
equal
to
bathing
again
if
she
touched
me
she
would
have
to
bathe
to
get
rid
of
the
defilement
of
course
i
assured
her
i
quite
understood
but
as
she
sat
there
within
two
inches
of
me
yet
so
carefully
preserving
inviolate
those
two
inches
of
clear
space
i
felt
what
a
small
thing
this
distance
was
the
merest
dust
of
the
actual
on
the
surface
of
the
system
of
her
life
and
yet
to
blow
a
of
it
off
nothing
less
is
needed
than
the
breath
of
the
power
of
god
come
o
breath
and
breathe
we
cry
nothing
else
will
do
something
in
our
talk
led
to
a
question
about
the
character
of
jesus
and
as
we
tried
to
describe
a
little
of
the
loveliness
of
our
dear
lord
to
her
her
dark
eyes
kindled
how
beautiful
it
is
she
said
how
beautiful
he
must
be
she
seemed
almost
persuaded
but
we
knew
it
was
only
almost
not
quite
for
she
does
not
yet
know
her
need
of
a
saviour
she
has
no
sense
of
sin
sometimes
it
is
true
that
comes
later
but
we
find
that
if
the
soul
is
to
resist
the
tremendous
opposing
forces
which
will
instantly
be
brought
to
bear
upon
it
if
it
turns
in
the
least
towards
christ
there
must
be
a
wrought
within
it
nothing
so
superficial
as
a
be
it
ever
so
appreciative
or
hopeful
or
loving
will
stand
that
strain
so
though
the
eyes
of
this
dear
woman
fill
with
tears
as
she
hears
of
the
price
of
pain
he
paid
and
though
she
gladly
listens
as
we
read
and
talk
with
her
and
pray
yet
we
know
the
work
has
not
gone
deep
and
we
make
our
petitions
deep
for
her
and
go
on
in
india
men
must
work
among
men
and
women
among
women
but
sometimes
in
new
places
as
i
have
told
before
we
have
to
stop
and
talk
with
the
men
before
they
will
let
us
pass
for
example
one
afternoon
i
was
waylaid
on
my
way
to
the
women
by
the
head
of
the
household
i
was
visiting
a
fine
old
man
of
the
usual
type
courteous
but
opposed
he
asked
to
look
at
my
books
i
had
a
bible
a
lyric
book
and
a
book
of
stanzas
bearing
upon
the
truth
copied
from
the
old
tamil
classics
he
pounced
upon
this
then
he
began
to
chant
the
stanzas
in
their
inimitable
way
and
at
the
sound
several
other
old
men
drew
round
the
verandah
till
soon
a
dozen
or
more
were
listening
with
that
appreciative
expression
they
seem
to
reserve
for
their
own
beloved
poetry
after
the
reader
had
chanted
through
a
dozen
or
more
stanzas
he
stopped
abruptly
and
asked
me
if
i
really
cared
for
it
of
course
i
said
i
did
immensely
and
only
wished
i
knew
more
for
the
tamil
classics
are
a
study
in
themselves
and
these
beautiful
ancient
verses
i
had
copied
out
were
only
gleanings
from
two
large
volumes
full
of
the
wisdom
of
the
east
they
were
all
thoroughly
friendly
now
and
we
got
into
conversation
one
of
the
group
held
that
there
are
three
substances
god
the
soul
and
sin
sin
is
eternally
bound
up
in
the
soul
as
verdigris
is
inherent
in
copper
it
can
be
removed
eventually
by
intense
meditation
upon
god
and
by
the
performance
of
arduous
works
of
merit
but
these
exercises
they
all
admitted
were
incompatible
with
the
ordinary
life
of
most
people
and
generally
impracticable
and
so
the
fact
is
the
verdigris
of
sin
remains
i
remember
the
delight
with
which
i
discovered
that
isaiah
i
uses
this
very
illustration
for
the
word
translated
dross
in
english
is
the
colloquial
word
for
verdigris
in
tamil
so
the
verse
reads
i
will
turn
my
hand
to
thee
and
thoroughly
purify
thee
as
to
remove
thy
most
of
the
others
held
a
diametrically
opposite
view
so
far
from
soul
and
sin
being
with
god
they
are
not
really
existent
at
all
both
are
illusory
there
is
only
one
existent
entity
it
is
the
divine
spirit
and
it
has
neither
personality
nor
any
personal
qualities
all
apparent
separate
existences
are
delusive
meditation
of
the
same
absorbing
type
held
necessary
by
the
other
is
the
only
way
to
reach
the
stage
of
enlightenment
which
leads
to
reabsorption
into
the
divine
essence
in
which
we
finally
merge
and
lose
what
appeared
to
be
our
separate
identity
we
are
lost
in
god
as
a
drop
is
lost
in
the
ocean
some
of
the
men
advocated
a
phase
of
truth
which
reminds
one
of
calvinism
gone
mad
and
others
exactly
opposite
are
extravagantly
arminian
the
calvinists
illustrate
their
belief
by
a
single
illuminating
word
and
the
arminians
by
another
could
you
find
better
illustrations
the
cat
takes
up
the
kitten
and
carries
it
in
its
mouth
the
kitten
is
passive
the
cat
does
everything
but
the
little
monkey
holds
on
to
its
mother
and
clings
with
might
and
main
those
who
have
watched
the
in
the
house
and
the
out
in
the
jungle
can
appreciate
the
accuracy
of
these
two
illustrations
but
running
through
every
form
of
hinduism
however
contradictory
each
to
the
other
may
be
there
is
the
underlying
thought
of
pure
and
simple
pantheism
and
this
explains
many
of
the
aforesaid
contradictions
and
many
of
the
incongruities
which
are
constantly
cropping
up
and
bewildering
one
who
is
trying
to
understand
the
hindu
trend
of
thought
so
though
those
men
all
affirmed
that
there
is
only
one
god
they
admitted
that
they
each
worshipped
several
they
saw
nothing
inconsistent
in
this
just
as
the
air
is
in
everything
so
god
is
in
everything
therefore
in
the
various
symbols
and
as
our
king
has
divers
representative
viceroys
and
governors
to
rule
over
his
dominions
in
his
name
so
the
supreme
has
these
less
in
power
and
only
existing
by
force
of
himself
and
he
being
can
be
worshipped
under
their
forms
this
argument
they
all
unitedly
pressed
upon
me
that
afternoon
and
though
capital
answers
probably
present
themselves
to
your
mind
you
might
not
find
they
satisfied
the
hindu
who
argues
along
lines
of
logic
peculiar
to
the
east
and
subtle
enough
to
mystify
the
practical
western
brain
and
then
for
we
are
conceited
as
well
as
practical
we
are
apt
to
pity
the
poor
hindu
for
being
so
unlike
ourselves
and
if
we
are
wholly
unsympathetic
we
growl
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
argument
whereas
there
is
a
good
deal
in
it
only
we
do
not
see
it
because
we
have
never
thought
out
the
difficulty
in
question
quite
opposite
sometimes
we
have
to
meet
a
type
of
mind
like
that
of
student
of
shakespeare
who
missed
a
plain
point
from
his
eyes
being
so
sharp
that
they
looked
through
it
without
seeing
it
having
focussed
themselves
beyond
it
assuredly
there
is
much
to
learn
before
one
can
hope
to
understand
the
winding
of
the
thread
of
thought
which
must
be
traced
if
one
would
follow
the
working
of
the
hindu
mind
let
no
one
with
a
facility
for
untying
mental
knots
think
that
his
gift
would
be
wasted
in
india
the
word
that
struck
those
men
that
afternoon
was
john
and
god
hath
given
us
eternal
life
and
this
life
is
in
his
son
he
that
hath
the
son
hath
life
and
he
that
hath
not
the
son
of
god
hath
not
life
i
was
longing
to
get
to
the
women
but
when
they
began
to
read
those
verses
and
ask
about
the
meaning
i
could
not
go
without
trying
to
tell
them
oh
how
one
needed
at
that
moment
christ
to
become
to
us
wisdom
for
it
is
just
here
one
may
so
easily
make
mistakes
put
the
truth
of
god
relation
to
the
soul
subjectively
he
that
hath
the
son
hath
life
before
thoughtful
hindus
such
as
these
men
were
and
they
will
be
perfectly
enchanted
for
the
incarnation
presents
no
difficulty
to
them
as
it
would
to
a
mohammedan
and
perhaps
to
your
sudden
surprise
and
joy
they
will
say
that
is
exactly
what
they
are
prepared
to
believe
christ
in
me
this
is
comprehensible
the
indwelling
of
the
spirit
of
god
this
is
analogous
to
their
own
phrase
the
indwelling
of
the
deity
in
the
lotus
of
the
heart
but
probably
by
trading
on
words
and
expressions
which
are
already
part
of
the
hindu
terminology
and
which
suggest
to
them
materialistic
ideas
we
may
seriously
mislead
and
be
misled
we
need
to
understand
not
only
what
the
hindu
says
but
also
what
his
words
mean
to
himself
a
very
different
thing
that
talk
ended
in
a
promise
from
the
men
that
they
would
arrange
a
meeting
of
hindus
for
the
iyer
if
he
would
come
and
take
it
which
of
course
he
did
i
should
like
to
finish
up
by
saying
and
several
were
converted
but
as
yet
that
would
not
be
true
these
ancient
and
strong
philosophies
are
formidable
enough
when
rightly
understood
to
make
us
feel
how
little
we
can
do
to
overturn
them
but
they
are
just
as
dust
in
comparison
with
the
force
of
the
actual
entrenched
behind
them
only
superficial
dust
and
yet
as
in
every
other
case
nothing
but
the
breath
of
god
can
blow
this
dust
away

another
widow
she
was
never
a
wife
and
moved
by
some
sort
of
pity
they
let
her
keep
one
jewel
in
each
ear
she
is
a
vellalar
her
people
are
wealthy
landowners
she
was
ashamed
of
having
yielded
to
the
weakness
of
letting
us
take
her
photo
and
when
we
went
to
show
it
to
her
she
would
not
look
at
it
she
has
no
desire
whatever
to
hear
and
she
and
the
young
girl
on
the
step
at
her
feet
are
resolute
in
opposing
the
teaching
we
left
the
old
men
to
their
books
and
endless
disquisitions
and
went
on
to
the
women
quarter
there
we
saw
a
young
very
fair
and
sweet
and
gentle
but
quieter
than
a
child
should
be
for
she
is
a
widow
accursed
her
mind
is
keen
she
wants
to
learn
but
why
should
a
widow
learn
they
say
why
should
her
mind
break
bounds
she
lives
in
a
tiny
house
in
a
tiny
yard
she
may
not
go
out
beyond
those
walls
then
why
should
she
beyond
but
she
is
better
off
than
most
for
she
lives
with
her
mother
who
loves
her
and
her
father
makes
a
pet
of
her
and
so
she
is
sheltered
more
or
less
from
the
cruel
scourge
of
the
tongue
there
is
another
in
the
next
courtyard
she
is
not
sheltered
so
she
lives
with
her
and
the
world
has
lashed
her
heart
for
years
it
is
simply
callous
now
there
she
sits
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
just
hard
years
ago
they
married
her
an
innocent
playful
little
child
to
a
man
who
died
when
she
was
nine
years
old
then
they
tore
her
jewels
from
her
all
but
two
little
which
they
left
in
pity
to
her
and
this
poor
little
scrap
of
jewellery
was
her
one
little
bit
of
joy
she
could
not
understand
it
at
first
and
when
her
pretty
coloured
seeleys
were
taken
away
and
she
had
to
wear
the
coarse
white
cloth
she
hated
so
she
cried
with
impotent
childish
wrath
and
then
she
was
punished
and
called
bitter
names
the
very
word
means
bitterness
and
gradually
she
understood
that
there
was
something
the
matter
with
her
she
was
not
like
other
little
girls
she
had
brought
to
the
home
she
was
accursed
it
is
true
that
some
are
more
gently
dealt
with
and
many
belong
to
castes
where
the
yoke
of
custom
lies
lighter
for
these
the
point
of
the
curse
is
blunted
there
is
only
a
dull
sense
of
wrong
but
in
all
the
upper
castes
the
pressure
is
heavy
and
there
are
those
who
feel
intensely
feel
to
the
centre
of
their
soul
the
sting
of
the
shame
of
the
curse
it
is
fate
says
the
troubled
mother
who
can
escape
his
fate
it
is
sin
says
the
and
the
rest
of
the
world
agrees
the
bull
goes
there
goes
its
rope
done
in
a
former
birth
in
this
birth
burn
much
of
the
working
of
the
curse
is
hidden
behind
shut
doors
i
saw
a
young
widow
last
week
whose
mind
is
becoming
deranged
in
consequence
of
the
severity
of
the
penance
she
is
compelled
to
perform
when
as
they
put
it
the
god
of
seizes
her
that
is
when
she
becomes
violent
she
is
quietly
removed
to
another
place
no
one
sees
what
is
done
to
her
there
but
i
know
that
part
of
the
treatment
consists
in
scratching
her
head
with
thorns
and
then
rubbing
raw
lime
juice
in
lime
juice
is
like
lemon
juice
only
more
acid
when
the
paroxysm
passes
she
reappears
and
does
penance
till
the
next
fit
comes
this
has
been
repeated
three
times
within
the
last
few
months
i
was
visiting
in
a
hindu
house
for
two
years
before
i
found
out
that
all
that
time
a
girl
of
seventeen
was
kept
alone
in
an
upper
room
let
her
weep
they
said
quoting
a
proverb
she
weeps
will
a
widow
sorrow
pass
once
a
day
after
dark
she
was
brought
downstairs
for
a
few
minutes
and
once
a
day
at
noon
some
coarse
food
was
taken
up
to
her
she
is
allowed
downstairs
now
but
only
in
the
back
part
of
the
house
she
never
thinks
of
resisting
this
decree
it
and
all
it
stands
for
is
her
fate
sometimes
the
glad
reasserts
itself
and
she
plays
and
laughs
with
her
pretty
baby
boy
but
if
she
hears
a
man
voice
she
disappears
upstairs
there
are
proverbs
in
the
language
which
tell
why
i
sat
on
the
verandah
of
a
hindu
house
one
day
and
talked
to
the
women
in
their
jewels
and
silks
and
all
the
time
though
little
i
knew
it
a
widow
was
tied
up
in
a
sack
in
one
of
the
inner
rooms
this
wrong
is
a
hidden
wrong
i
do
not
think
that
anyone
would
call
the
hindus
distinctively
cruel
in
comparison
with
most
other
asiatics
their
instincts
are
kind
a
custom
so
merciless
as
this
custom
which
punishes
the
innocent
with
so
grievous
a
punishment
does
not
seem
to
us
to
be
natural
to
them
it
seems
like
a
parasite
custom
which
has
struck
its
roots
deep
into
the
tree
of
hindu
social
life
but
is
not
part
of
it
think
of
the
power
which
must
have
been
exerted
somewhere
by
someone
before
the
disposition
of
a
nation
could
be
changed
this
custom
as
it
stands
is
formidable
enough
many
a
man
indian
and
foreign
has
fought
it
and
failed
it
is
a
huge
and
most
rigorous
system
of
tyrannical
oppression
a
very
pyramid
to
look
at
old
immovable
but
there
is
something
greater
behind
it
it
is
only
the
effect
of
a
cause
the
dust
of
the
actual
what
can
alter
the
custom
strong
writing
or
speaking
agitations
acts
of
parliament
all
these
surely
have
their
part
they
raise
the
question
stir
the
dust
but
blow
it
off
oh
no
nothing
can
touch
the
conscience
of
the
people
and
utterly
reverse
their
view
of
things
and
radically
alter
them
but
yes
it
is
true
we
may
make
the
most
of
what
has
been
done
by
government
by
missionaries
and
reformers
but
there
are
times
in
the
heart
histories
of
all
who
look
far
enough
down
to
see
what
goes
on
under
the
surface
of
things
when
the
sorrow
takes
shape
in
the
prophet
cry
we
have
not
wrought
any
deliverance
in
the
earth
it
is
true
have
not
we
can
not
even
estimate
the
real
weight
of
the
lightest
speck
of
the
dust
that
has
settled
on
the
life
of
this
people
but
we
believe
that
our
god
who
comprehended
the
dust
of
the
earth
in
a
measure
comprehends
to
the
uttermost
the
dust
of
the
actual
and
we
believe
to
see
him
work
with
whom
is
strength
and
effectual
working
we
believe
to
see
and
believing
even
now
we
see
and
when
we
see
anything
be
it
ever
so
little
when
the
breath
breathes
and
even
a
of
that
dust
is
blown
away
then
with
an
intensity
i
can
not
describe
we
feel
the
presence
of
the
lord
our
god
among
us
and
look
up
in
the
silence
of
joy
and
expectation
for
the
coming
of
the
day
when
all
rule
and
all
authority
and
power
yea
the
power
of
the
very
actual
itself
shall
be
put
down
that
god
may
be
all
in
all
so
again
and
yet
again
we
ask
you
to
pray
not
less
for
the
reform
movement
and
the
educational
movement
and
the
civilising
movement
of
india
but
far
more
for
the
movement
of
the
breath
of
god
and
far
more
for
us
his
workers
here
that
we
may
abide
in
him
without
whom
we
can
do
nothing

we
have
a
number
of
these
keen
interesting
old
people
but
very
rarely
find
they
have
any
desire
to
change
their
religion
they
are
rooted

the

god
and
rousing

she
declares
that
he
is

constant
meditation
therefore
all
is
well
is
the
rice
ready
no
then
give
me
some
betel
leaf
and
she
settles
down
to
roll
small
pieces
of
lime
into
little
balls
and
these
balls
she
rolls
up
in
a
betel
leaf
with
a
bit
of
areca
nut
for
taste
and
this
betel
leaf
she
puts
into
her
mouth
all
this
very
slowly
and
with
many
inarticulate
sounds
which
i
have
translated

and
this
is
all
she
does
she
does
not
want
to
listen
or
talk
she
only
wants
to
scrunch
betel
and
grunt
this
is
not
a
touching
tale
it
is
only
true
it
happened
this
evening
exactly
as
i
have
told
it
and
the
girl
a
distant
connection
of
the
old
woman
who
had
come
with
me
so
delightedly
eager
to
tell
the
good
tidings
had
to
give
it
up
she
had
begun
by
speaking
about
the
love
of
jesus
but
that
had
fallen
perfectly
flat
so
she
had
tried
the
more
startling
form
of
address
with
this
result
grunts
i
spent
an
afternoon
not
long
ago
with
a
more
intelligent
specimen
here
she
is
a
fine
sturdy
old
character
one
of
the
three
you
saw
before
she
was
immensely
interested
with
her
photo
which
i
showed
her
and
she
could
not
understand
at
all
how
in
the
one
moment
when
she
stood
against
a
wall
her
face
had
been
caught
on
a
piece
of
white
paper
a
little
explanation
opened
the
way
for
the
greater
thing
i
had
come
about
we
were
sitting
on
a
mud
verandah
opening
on
to
a
square
courtyard
two
women
pounding
rice
two
more
grinding
it
another
sweeping
a
cow
some
fowls
a
great
many
children
and
several
babies
made
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
concentrate
one
attention
on
anything
and
still
more
difficult
to
get
the
wandering
brains
of
an
old
woman
to
concentrate
on
a
subject
in
which
she
had
no
interest
she
had
been
interested
in
the
photograph
but
that
was
different
the
conversation
ended
by
her
remarking
that
it
was
getting
dark
ought
i
not
to
be
going
home
it
was
not
getting
dark
yet
but
it
meant
that
she
had
had
enough
so
i
salaamed
and
went
hoping
for
a
better
chance
again
next
time
we
visited
the
village
of
the
tamarind
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
she
had
gone
to
her
own
village
she
had
only
come
here
for
the
funeral
would
she
return
we
asked
not
probable
they
said
she
had
come
and
gone
come
and
gone
as
they
said
it
one
felt
how
true
it
was
come
for
that
one
short
afternoon
within
our
reach
gone
out
of
it
now
for
ever
in
that
same
village
there
is
one
who
more
than
any
other
drew
heart
out
in
affection
and
longing
but
so
far
all
in
vain
i
first
saw
her
in
the
evening
as
we
were
returning
home
she
was
sitting
on
her
verandah
giving
orders
to
the
servants
as
they
stood
in
the
courtyard
below
then
she
turned
and
saw
us
we
were
standing
in
the
street
looking
through
the
open
door
the
old
lady
in
her
white
garments
with
her
white
hair
sat
among
a
group
of
women
in
vivid
shades
of
red
behind
her
the
dark
wood
of
the
pillar
and
door
and
above
the
carved
verandah
roof
the
men
were
fresh
from
the
fields
and
stood
with
their
husbandry
implements
slung
across
their
shoulders
the
oxen
great
beasts
were
munching
their
straw
and
swishing
their
tails
as
they
stood
in
their
places
in
the
courtyard
where
some
little
children
played
the
which
are
small
white
storks
were
flying
about
from
frond
to
frond
of
the
cocoanut
palms
that
hung
over
the
wall
and
the
sunset
light
striking
slanting
up
caught
the
underside
of
their
wings
and
made
them
shine
with
a
clear
pale
gold
gold
birds
in
a
darkness
of
green
a
broken
mud
wall
ran
round
one
end
and
the
sunset
colour
painted
it
too
till
all
the
red
in
it
glowed
and
then
it
came
softly
through
the
palms
and
touched
the
white
head
with
a
sort
of
sheen
and
lit
up
the
brow
of
the
fine
old
face
as
bending
forward
she
beckoned
to
us
come
in
come
in
she
said
we
soon
made
friends
with
her
she
was
a
saivite
and
we
heard
afterwards
had
received
the
initiation
the
golden
symbol
of
her
god
had
been
branded
upon
her
shoulder
and
she
was
sworn
to
lifelong
devotion
to
siva
but
she
had
found
that
he
was
vain
and
she
never
worshipped
him
she
worshipped
god
alone
and
at
night
when
the
household
is
sleeping
i
go
up
alone
to
an
upper
room
and
stretch
out
my
hands
to
the
god
of
all
and
cry
with
a
long
loud
cry
then
she
suddenly
turned
and
faced
me
full
tell
me
is
that
enough
she
said
is
it
all
i
must
do
for
salvation
say
i
did
not
feel
she
was
ready
for
a
plunge
into
the
deep
sea
of
full
knowledge
yet
and
i
tried
to
persuade
her
to
leave
that
question
telling
her
that
if
she
believed
what
we
told
her
of
jesus
our
lord
she
would
soon
know
him
well
enough
to
ask
him
direct
what
she
wanted
to
know
and
he
himself
would
explain
to
her
all
that
it
meant
to
follow
him
but
she
was
determined
to
hear
it
then
and
as
she
insisted
i
read
her
a
little
of
what
he
says
about
it
himself
she
knew
quite
enough
to
understand
and
take
in
the
force
of
the
forceful
words
she
would
not
consent
to
be
led
gently
on
no
i
must
know
it
now
she
said
and
as
verse
by
verse
we
read
to
her
her
face
settled
sorrowfully
so
far
must
i
follow
so
far
she
said
can
not
follow
so
it
was
too
late
for
much
talk
then
but
she
promised
to
listen
if
we
would
come
and
read
to
her
she
could
not
read
but
she
seemed
to
know
a
great
deal
about
the
bible
for
some
weeks
one
of
us
went
once
a
week
sometimes
the
men
of
the
house
were
in
and
then
we
could
not
read
to
her
as
they
seemed
to
object
but
oftener
no
one
was
about
and
she
had
her
way
and
we
read
she
told
us
her
story
one
afternoon
she
was
the
head
of
a
famous
old
house
her
husband
had
died
many
years
ago
she
had
brought
up
her
children
successfully
and
now
they
were
settled
in
life
she
had
a
christian
relation
but
she
had
never
seen
him
she
thought
he
had
a
son
studying
in
a
large
school
in
england
cambridge
i
knew
when
i
heard
the
name
the
father
is
one
of
our
true
friends
all
her
sons
are
greatly
opposed
but
one
of
her
little
girls
learnt
for
a
time
and
so
the
mother
heard
the
truth
and
being
convinced
that
it
was
true
greatly
desired
to
hear
more
but
the
child
was
married
and
went
away
and
she
feared
to
ask
the
missie
ammal
to
come
again
lest
people
should
notice
it
and
talk
so
the
years
passed
emptily
and
oh
my
heart
was
an
empty
place
a
void
as
empty
as
air
and
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
clasping
her
hands
she
looked
at
the
empty
space
between
and
then
at
me
with
inquiring
eyes
to
see
if
i
understood
how
well
one
understood
i
am
an
emptiness
for
thee
to
fill
my
soul
a
cavern
for
thy
sea
i
have
done
nought
for
thee
am
but
a
want
she
had
never
heard
it
but
she
had
said
it
we
do
not
often
hear
it
said
and
when
we
do
our
whole
heart
goes
out
to
meet
the
heart
of
the
one
who
says
it
everything
that
is
in
us
yearns
with
a
yearning
that
can
not
be
told
to
bring
her
to
him
who
said
come
we
were
full
of
hope
about
her
and
we
wrote
to
her
christian
relative
and
he
wrote
back
with
joy
it
seemed
so
likely
then
that
she
would
decide
for
christ
but
one
day
for
the
first
time
she
did
not
care
to
read
i
remember
that
day
so
well
it
was
the
time
of
our
monsoon
and
the
country
was
one
great
marsh
we
had
promised
to
go
that
morning
but
the
night
before
the
rivers
filled
and
the
pool
between
her
and
us
was
a
lake
we
called
the
bandyman
and
explained
the
situation
he
debated
a
little
but
at
last
well
the
bulls
can
swim
he
said
and
they
swam
we
need
not
have
gone
she
was
out
out
or
not
at
home
is
a
phrase
not
confined
to
society
circles
where
courtesy
counts
for
more
than
truth
i
am
in
but
i
do
not
want
to
see
you
would
have
been
true
but
rude
this
was
the
first
chill
but
she
was
in
next
time
and
continued
to
be
in
until
after
a
long
talk
we
had
when
again
the
question
rose
and
had
to
be
faced
can
i
be
a
christian
it
was
a
quiet
afternoon
we
were
alone
only
the
little
grandchildren
were
with
her
innocent
fearless
merry
little
creatures
running
to
her
with
their
wants
and
pulling
at
her
hands
and
dress
as
babies
do
at
home
their
grandmother
took
no
notice
of
them
beyond
an
occasional
pat
or
two
but
the
childish
things
with
their
bright
brown
eyes
and
little
fat
soft
clinging
hands
went
into
the
photo
one
memory
took
and
helped
one
the
better
to
understand
and
sympathise
in
the
humanness
of
the
pretty
home
scene
that
humanness
which
is
so
natural
and
which
god
meant
to
be
i
think
there
is
nothing
in
all
our
work
which
so
rends
and
tears
at
the
within
us
as
seeing
the
spiritual
clash
with
the
natural
and
to
know
that
while
caste
and
bigotry
reign
it
always
must
be
so
we
had
a
good
long
talk
i
want
to
be
a
christian
she
said
and
for
a
moment
i
hoped
great
things
for
she
as
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
almost
free
to
do
as
she
chose
i
thought
of
her
influence
over
her
sons
and
their
wives
and
the
little
grandchildren
and
i
think
my
face
showed
the
hope
i
had
for
she
said
looking
very
direct
at
me
by
a
christian
i
mean
one
who
worships
your
god
and
ceases
to
worship
all
other
gods
for
he
alone
is
the
living
god
the
pervader
of
all
and
provider
this
i
fully
believe
and
affirm
but
i
can
not
break
my
caste
would
you
continue
to
keep
it
in
all
ways
how
could
i
possibly
break
my
caste
and
continue
to
smear
siva
sign
on
your
forehead
that
is
indeed
part
of
my
caste
more
especially
part
of
it
i
knew
since
she
had
received
the
initiation
then
the
disappointment
got
into
my
voice
and
she
felt
it
and
said
oh
do
not
be
grieved
these
things
are
external
how
can
mere
ashes
affect
the
internal
the
real
essential
the
soul
it
was
such
a
plausible
argument
and
we
hear
it
over
and
over
again
for
history
repeats
itself
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
i
reminded
her
that
ashes
were
sacred
to
siva
i
would
not
serve
siva
she
answered
me
but
the
smearing
of
ashes
on
one
brow
is
the
custom
of
my
caste
and
i
can
not
break
my
caste
then
she
looked
at
me
very
earnestly
with
her
searching
beautiful
keen
old
eyes
and
she
went
over
ground
she
knew
i
knew
she
reminded
me
what
the
requirements
of
her
caste
had
always
been
that
they
must
be
fulfilled
by
all
who
live
in
the
house
and
she
told
me
in
measured
words
and
slow
that
i
knew
she
could
not
live
at
home
if
she
broke
the
laws
of
her
caste
but
why
make
so
much
of
trifling
things
for
matter
and
spirit
are
distinct
and
when
the
hands
are
raised
in
prayer
when
the
lamp
is
lighted
and
wreathed
with
flowers
the
outward
observer
may
mistake
and
think
the
action
is
pujah
to
agni
but
god
who
reads
the
heart
understands
and
judges
the
thought
and
not
the
act
yes
my
hand
may
smear
on
siva
ashes
while
at
the
same
moment
my
soul
may
commune
with
god
the
eternal
who
only
is
god
i
turned
to
verse
after
verse
to
show
her
this
sort
of
thing
could
never
be
how
it
would
mock
at
the
love
of
christ
and
nullify
his
sacrifice
i
urged
upon
her
that
if
she
were
true
and
the
central
thought
of
her
life
were
towards
god
all
the
outworkings
would
correspond
creed
fitting
deed
and
deed
fitting
creed
without
the
least
shade
of
diversity
but
faith
and
practice
are
not
to
be
confused
each
is
separate
from
the
other
the
two
may
unite
or
the
one
may
be
divorced
from
the
other
without
the
integrity
of
either
being
affected
this
is
the
unwritten
hindu
code
which
she
and
hers
had
ever
held
and
now
after
years
of
belief
in
it
to
face
round
suddenly
to
its
opposite
this
was
more
than
she
could
do
she
held
as
it
were
the
truth
in
her
hand
and
turned
it
round
and
round
and
round
but
she
always
ended
where
she
began
she
would
not
not
see
it
as
truth
or
perhaps
more
truly
would
not
accept
it
it
meant
too
much
there
she
sat
queen
of
her
home
the
sons
were
expected
and
she
had
been
making
preparations
for
their
coming
her
little
grandchildren
played
about
her
each
one
of
them
dear
as
the
jewel
of
her
eye
how
could
she
leave
it
all
how
could
she
leave
them
all
home
all
that
it
stands
for
children
all
that
they
mean
then
she
looked
at
me
again
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
looking
me
through
and
through
and
forcing
the
answer
to
come
she
spoke
in
little
short
sentences
instinct
with
intensity
i
live
here
and
break
my
caste
if
i
break
it
i
must
go
i
live
here
without
keeping
my
customs
if
i
break
them
i
must
go
you
know
all
this
i
ask
you
then
tell
me
yes
or
no
can
i
live
here
and
keep
my
caste
and
at
the
same
time
follow
your
god
tell
me
yes
or
no
i
did
not
tell
her
how
could
i
but
she
read
the
answer
in
my
eyes
and
she
said
as
she
had
said
before
i
can
not
follow
so
far
so
far
can
not
follow
so
reverence
for
opinions
and
practice
held
sacred
by
his
ancestors
is
ingrained
in
every
fibre
of
a
hindu
character
and
is
so
to
speak
bred
in
the
very
bone
of
his
physical
and
moral
constitution
so
writes
sir
monier
williams
it
is
absolutely
true
oh
friends
is
it
easy
work
my
heart
is
sore
as
i
write
with
the
soreness
that
filled
it
that
day
i
would
have
given
anything
to
be
able
truthfully
to
say
yes
to
her
question
but
across
the
will
of
nature
leads
on
the
path
of
god
for
them
and
they
have
to
follow
so
very
far
so
very
very
far
all
trees
have
roots
to
tear
up
a
tree
by
the
roots
and
transplant
it
bodily
is
never
a
simple
process
but
in
india
we
have
a
tree
with
a
double
system
of
roots
the
banyan
tree
drops
roots
from
its
boughs
these
bough
roots
in
time
run
as
deep
underground
as
the
original
root
and
the
tap
root
and
its
runners
and
the
branch
roots
and
theirs
get
knotted
and
knit
into
each
other
till
the
whole
forms
one
solid
mass
of
roots
thousands
of
yards
of
a
tangle
of
roots
sinuous
and
strong
conceive
the
uprooting
of
such
a
tree
like
the
famous
one
of
north
india
for
instance
which
sheltered
an
army
of
seven
thousand
men
you
can
not
conceive
it
it
could
not
be
done
the
earthward
hold
is
so
strong
the
old
in
india
are
like
these
trees
they
are
doubly
inextricably
rooted
there
is
the
usual
great
tap
root
common
to
all
human
trees
in
all
lands
faith
in
the
creed
of
the
race
there
are
the
usual
running
roots
too
devotion
to
family
and
home
all
these
hold
the
soul
down
but
in
india
we
have
more
we
have
the
system
of
caste
caste
so
intricate
so
precise
that
no
western
lives
who
has
traced
it
through
its
ramifications
back
to
the
bough
from
which
it
dropped
in
the
olden
days
this
caste
then
these
holding
laws
which
most
would
rather
die
than
break
are
like
the
branch
roots
of
the
banyan
tree
with
their
infinite
strength
of
grip
but
the
strangest
thing
to
us
is
this
the
people
love
to
have
it
so
they
do
not
regard
themselves
as
held
these
roots
are
their
pride
and
joy
take
a
child
of
four
or
five
ask
it
a
question
concerning
its
caste
and
you
will
see
how
that
baby
tree
has
begun
to
drop
branch
rootlets
down
sixty
years
afterwards
look
again
and
every
rootlet
has
grown
a
tree
each
again
sending
rootlets
down
and
so
the
system
spreads
but
we
look
up
from
the
banyan
tree
god
what
are
these
roots
to
thee
these
systems
are
nothing
to
thee
india
is
not
too
hard
for
thee
o
god
come
chapter
ix
the
classes
and
the
masses
we
speak
of
work
done
against
the
force
of
gravitation
if
the
magnitude
of
a
force
can
be
estimated
in
any
sense
by
the
resistance
which
it
has
to
overcome
then
verily
there
is
no
land
under
the
sun
more
calculated
than
india
to
display
the
grand
forces
of
god
omnipotent
grace
for
here
it
has
to
face
and
overcome
the
of
the
caste
system
entrenched
heathenism
and
deeply
subtle
philosophies
praise
god
it
can
and
will
be
done
thou
who
alone
doest
wondrous
things
work
on
will
we
sing
and
praise
thy
power
walker
perhaps
it
would
help
towards
the
better
understanding
of
these
letters
if
we
stopped
and
explained
things
a
little
some
may
have
been
wondering
as
they
read
how
it
is
that
while
the
south
indian
fields
are
constantly
quoted
as
among
the
most
fruitful
in
the
world
we
seem
to
be
dealing
with
a
class
where
fruit
is
very
rare
and
so
subject
to
blighting
influences
after
it
has
appeared
that
we
hardly
like
to
speak
of
it
till
it
is
ripe
and
reaped
and
safe
in
the
heavenly
garner
i
think
it
will
be
easier
to
understand
all
this
if
we
view
hindu
tamil
south
india
with
which
alone
this
book
deals
from
the
outside
and
let
it
fall
into
two
divisions
the
classes
and
the
masses
there
is
of
course
the
border
line
between
crossed
over
on
either
side
by
some
who
belong
to
the
classes
but
are
almost
of
the
masses
and
by
some
who
belong
to
the
masses
but
are
almost
of
the
classes
broadly
speaking
however
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
the
two
as
to
their
attitude
towards
the
gospel
the
classes
and
the
masses
unite
they
are
wholly
indifferent
to
it
in
a
paper
read
at
the
student
volunteers
conference
in
a
south
indian
missionary
summed
up
the
matter
in
a
comprehensive
sentence
shut
in
for
millenniums
by
the
gigantic
wall
of
the
himalayas
on
the
north
and
by
the
impassable
ocean
on
the
south
they
have
lived
in
seclusion
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
have
developed
social
institutions
and
conceptions
of
the
universe
and
of
right
and
wrong
quite
their
own
their
own
religion
and
traditionary
customs
are
accepted
as
sufficiently
meeting
their
needs
and
they
are
not
conscious
of
needing
any
teaching
from
foreigners
they
will
always
listen
courteously
to
what
we
say
and
this
constitutes
an
open
door
for
the
gospel
but
of
conscious
need
and
hungering
for
the
gospel
there
is
little
or
none
so
long
as
it
is
only
a
matter
of
preaching
there
are
in
the
world
no
more
patient
listeners
than
the
hindus
but
as
soon
as
a
case
arises
of
one
of
their
number
abandoning
the
caste
customs
and
traditionary
worship
all
their
hostility
is
aroused
and
the
whole
community
feels
it
a
duty
of
patriotism
to
do
its
utmost
to
deprive
that
individual
of
liberty
of
action
and
to
defend
the
vested
rights
of
hinduism
for
the
true
hindu
is
fervently
hindu
his
religion
may
be
described
as
bound
up
in
the
bundle
of
his
everyday
existence
his
intense
belief
in
it
and
in
his
caste
which
is
part
of
it
gives
edge
to
the
blade
with
which
he
fights
the
entrance
of
a
new
religion
to
his
home
this
new
religion
he
conceives
of
as
something
inherently
antagonistic
to
his
caste
and
as
caste
is
at
every
point
connected
with
hinduism
a
thing
interwoven
with
it
as
if
hinduism
were
the
warp
and
caste
the
woof
of
the
fabric
of
indian
life
we
can
not
say
he
is
mistaken
in
regarding
christianity
as
a
foe
to
be
fought
if
he
would
continue
a
caste
hindu
so
far
in
south
indian
religious
history
we
have
no
example
on
a
large
scale
of
anything
approaching
the
bramo
samâj
of
the
north
in
the
more
conservative
south
there
is
almost
no
compromise
with
and
little
assimilation
of
the
doctrine
which
makes
all
men
one
in
christ
to
return
to
the
division
classes
and
masses
the
classes
comprise
members
of
what
are
known
as
the
higher
castes
and
in
speaking
of
towns
and
villages
where
these
dwell
and
of
converts
from
among
them
the
prefix
caste
is
sometimes
used
among
the
classes
we
find
women
of
much
tenderness
of
feeling
and
a
culture
of
their
own
but
their
minds
are
narrowed
by
the
petty
lives
they
live
lives
in
many
instances
bounded
by
no
wider
horizon
than
thoughts
concerning
their
husbands
and
children
and
jewels
and
curries
and
always
their
squabbles
and
the
gossip
of
the
place
much
of
this
gossip
deals
with
matters
which
are
not
of
an
elevating
character
it
takes
us
years
to
understand
it
because
most
of
the
conversation
is
carried
on
in
allusion
or
innuendo
but
it
is
understood
by
the
children
one
of
our
converts
told
me
that
she
often
prays
for
power
to
forget
the
words
she
heard
and
the
things
she
saw
and
the
games
she
played
when
she
was
a
little
child
in
her
mother
room
illustration
this
old
man
is
the
hindu
village
schoolmaster
the
boys
write
on
a
strip
of
palm
leaf
with
an
iron
style
these
little
lads
come
to
us
every
sunday
afternoon
will
some
one
remember
them
the
young
girls
belonging
to
the
higher
castes
are
kept
in
strict
seclusion
during
these
formative
years
they
are
shut
up
within
the
courtyard
walls
to
the
dwarfing
life
within
and
as
a
result
they
get
dwarfed
and
lose
in
resourcefulness
and
independence
of
mind
and
above
all
in
courage
and
this
tells
terribly
in
our
work
making
it
so
difficult
to
persuade
such
a
one
to
think
for
herself
or
dare
to
decide
to
believe
such
seclusion
is
not
felt
as
imprisonment
a
girl
is
trained
to
regard
it
as
the
proper
thing
and
we
never
find
any
desire
among
those
so
secluded
to
break
bounds
and
rush
out
into
the
free
open
air
they
do
not
feel
it
cramped
as
we
should
it
is
their
custom
it
is
this
custom
which
makes
work
among
girls
exceedingly
slow
and
unresultful
they
have
to
be
reached
one
by
one
and
it
takes
many
months
of
teaching
before
the
mind
opens
enough
to
understand
that
it
may
be
free
the
reaction
of
the
physical
upon
the
mental
is
never
more
clearly
illustrated
than
in
such
cases
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
the
mind
not
go
out
beyond
the
cramping
walls
but
when
it
has
by
god
illumination
received
light
enough
to
see
into
the
darkness
of
the
soul
and
the
glory
that
waits
to
shine
in
on
it
conceive
of
the
tremendous
upheaval
the
shock
of
finding
solid
ground
sink
as
gradually
or
suddenly
the
conviction
comes
upon
such
a
one
that
if
she
acts
upon
this
new
knowledge
there
is
no
place
for
her
at
home
she
must
give
everything
up
do
you
wonder
that
few
are
found
willing
to
follow
so
far
do
you
wonder
that
our
hearts
nearly
break
sometimes
as
we
realize
the
cost
for
them
do
you
wonder
that
knowing
how
each
is
set
as
a
target
for
the
archer
who
shoots
at
souls
we
fear
to
say
much
about
them
lest
we
should
set
the
targets
clearer
in
his
sight
the
men
and
boys
of
the
classes
live
a
more
liberal
life
and
here
you
find
all
varying
shades
of
refinement
there
is
education
too
and
a
great
respect
for
learning
and
reverence
for
their
classic
literature
and
language
a
language
so
ancient
that
we
find
certain
tamil
words
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
and
so
rich
that
while
nearly
all
the
vernaculars
of
india
have
been
greatly
enriched
from
the
sanscrit
sanscrit
has
borrowed
from
tamil
almost
every
caste
village
has
its
own
little
school
and
every
town
has
many
where
the
boys
are
taught
reading
writing
poetry
and
mental
arithmetic
there
is
not
much
education
among
the
masses
here
and
there
a
man
stands
out
who
has
fought
his
way
through
the
ignorance
of
centuries
up
into
the
light
of
the
knowledge
of
books
such
a
man
is
greatly
respected
by
the
whole
community
the
women
have
the
same
kindly
nature
as
the
women
of
the
classes
and
there
is
surprising
responsiveness
sometimes
where
one
would
least
expect
it
we
have
known
a
tamil
woman
distinctly
of
the
masses
never
secluded
in
her
girlhood
but
left
to
bloom
as
a
wild
flower
in
the
field
as
sensitive
in
spirit
as
any
lady
born
the
people
are
rough
and
rustic
in
their
ways
but
there
are
certain
laws
observed
which
show
a
spirit
of
refinement
latent
among
them
there
are
customs
which
compare
favourably
with
the
customs
of
the
masses
at
home
as
a
whole
they
are
like
the
masses
of
other
lands
with
good
points
and
bad
points
in
strong
relief
and
just
the
same
souls
to
be
saved
converts
from
among
the
masses
as
a
general
rule
are
able
to
live
at
home
there
is
persecution
but
they
are
not
turned
out
of
village
street
or
house
often
they
come
in
groups
two
or
three
families
together
perhaps
or
a
whole
village
led
by
its
headman
comes
over
there
is
less
of
the
single
conversion
and
confession
though
there
is
an
increasing
number
of
such
and
they
are
the
best
we
have
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
much
more
rapidly
christianity
spreads
under
such
conditions
than
among
those
prevailing
among
the
classes
we
see
it
illustrated
over
and
over
again
for
example
in
a
certain
hindu
town
some
miles
distant
from
our
station
on
the
eastern
side
a
young
man
heard
the
gospel
preached
at
an
meeting
he
believed
and
confessed
in
baptism
thus
breaking
caste
and
becoming
an
alien
to
his
own
people
he
has
never
been
able
to
live
at
home
since
and
so
there
has
been
no
witness
borne
no
chance
to
let
the
life
show
out
the
love
of
god
the
men
of
that
household
doubtless
know
something
of
the
truth
they
know
enough
at
least
to
make
them
responsible
for
refusing
it
but
what
can
the
women
know
only
that
the
son
of
the
house
has
disgraced
his
house
and
name
only
that
he
has
destroyed
his
caste
and
broken
his
mother
heart
shame
upon
him
they
cry
with
one
voice
and
curses
on
the
cause
of
the
shame
the
of
jesus
christ
it
is
useless
to
say
they
are
merely
women
and
do
not
count
they
count
their
influence
counts
for
a
very
great
deal
theoretically
women
in
india
are
nothing
where
religion
is
concerned
practically
they
are
the
heart
of
the
hindu
religion
as
the
men
are
its
sinew
and
brain
there
has
never
been
a
convert
in
that
town
since
that
young
man
was
banished
from
it
by
his
caste
but
in
a
village
only
a
few
miles
from
that
town
a
heathen
lad
believed
and
was
baptised
and
returned
home
not
so
welcome
as
before
but
not
considered
too
defiled
to
be
reckoned
a
son
of
the
household
still
his
father
is
dead
his
mother
is
a
bitter
opponent
but
his
brother
has
come
since
and
within
a
another
and
so
it
goes
on
the
life
has
a
chance
to
tell
almost
every
time
we
have
gone
to
that
village
we
have
found
some
ready
for
baptism
and
though
none
of
the
mothers
have
been
won
they
witness
to
the
change
in
the
life
of
their
sons
my
boy
heart
is
as
white
as
milk
now
said
one
who
had
stood
by
and
seen
that
boy
tied
up
and
flogged
for
christ
sake
they
rarely
change
their
religion
these
staunch
old
souls
let
me
go
where
my
husband
is
he
would
have
none
of
it
said
one
and
nothing
seems
to
move
them
but
they
let
their
boys
live
at
home
and
perhaps
even
yet
the
love
will
break
down
their
resistance
they
are
giving
it
a
chance
i
think
this
one
illustration
explains
more
than
many
words
would
the
difference
between
work
among
the
classes
and
the
masses
and
why
it
is
that
one
form
of
work
is
so
much
more
fruitful
than
the
other
the
masses
must
not
be
understood
as
a
vast
casteless
mass
by
the
classes
for
the
caste
system
runs
down
to
the
very
lowest
stratum
but
their
caste
rules
allow
of
freer
intercourse
with
others
we
may
visit
in
their
houses
more
freely
enter
more
freely
into
their
thoughts
share
more
freely
in
the
interests
of
their
lives
we
are
less
outside
as
it
were
but
the
main
difference
between
the
one
set
of
people
and
the
other
lies
deeper
it
is
a
difference
underground
it
works
out
however
into
something
all
can
see
among
the
masses
mass
movements
are
of
common
occurrence
among
the
classes
with
rare
exceptions
each
one
must
come
out
alone
illustration

this
is
often
forgotten
by
observers
of
the

field
from
the

side
there
are
parts
of
that
field
where
the
labourers
seem
to
be
always
binding
up
sheaves
and
singing
harvest
songs
and
from
other
parts
come
fewer

are
fewer

it
may
be
there
are

chapter
x
the
creed
chasm
i
have
had
to
deal
in
the
same
afternoon
work
on
the
one
hand
with
men
of
keen
powers
of
intellect
whose
subtle
reasoning
made
one
look
to
the
foundations
of
one
own
faith
and
on
the
other
hand
with
ignorant
crowds
whose
conception
of
sin
was
that
of
a
cubit
measure
and
to
whom
the
terms
and
were
as
absolutely
unknown
as
though
they
had
been
born
and
bred
in
some
undeveloped
race
of
anthropoids
walker
in
writing
about
the
classes
and
the
masses
of
south
india
one
great
difference
which
does
not
exist
at
home
should
be
explained
in
england
a
prince
and
a
peasant
may
be
divided
by
outward
things
social
position
style
of
life
and
the
duty
of
life
but
in
all
inward
things
they
may
be
one
one
in
faith
one
in
purpose
one
in
hope
the
difference
which
divides
them
is
only
accidental
external
and
the
peasant
perhaps
being
in
advance
of
the
prince
in
these
verities
of
existence
may
be
regarded
by
the
prince
as
nobler
than
himself
there
is
no
spiritual
chasm
between
them
it
is
the
same
in
the
realm
of
scholarship
all
true
christians
however
learned
or
however
unlearned
hold
one
and
the
same
faith
but
in
india
it
is
not
so
the
scholar
would
smile
at
the
faith
of
the
simple
villagers
he
would
even
teach
them
to
believe
that
which
he
did
not
believe
himself
holding
that
it
was
more
suitable
for
them
and
he
would
marvel
at
your
ignorance
if
you
confounded
his
creed
with
theirs
and
yet
in
name
both
he
and
they
are
hindus
sir
monier
williams
explains
the
existence
of
this
difference
by
describing
the
receptivity
and
of
hinduism
it
has
something
to
offer
which
is
suited
to
all
minds
its
very
strength
lies
in
its
infinite
adaptability
to
the
infinite
diversity
of
human
characters
and
human
tendencies
it
has
its
highly
spiritual
and
abstract
side
suited
to
the
metaphysical
philosopher
its
practical
and
concrete
side
suited
to
the
man
of
affairs
and
the
man
of
the
world
its
æsthetic
and
ceremonial
side
suited
to
the
man
of
poetic
feeling
and
imagination
its
quiescent
and
contemplative
side
suited
to
the
man
of
peace
and
lover
of
seclusion
nay
it
holds
out
the
right
hand
of
brotherhood
to
nature
worshippers
demon
worshippers
animal
worshippers
tree
worshippers
fetich
worshippers
it
does
not
scruple
to
permit
the
most
grotesque
forms
of
idolatry
and
the
most
degrading
varieties
of
superstition
and
it
is
to
this
latter
fact
that
yet
another
remarkable
peculiarity
of
hinduism
is
mainly
due
that
in
no
other
system
of
the
world
is
the
chasm
more
vast
which
separates
the
religion
of
the
higher
cultured
and
thoughtful
classes
from
that
of
the
lower
uncultured
and
unthinking
naturally
therefore
work
among
them
is
different
one
almost
needs
a
different
vocabulary
for
each
and
certainly
one
needs
a
different
set
of
ideas
i
remember
how
in
one
afternoon
work
we
saw
the
two
types
most
perfectly
in
thinking
of
it
it
is
as
if
one
saw
again
the
quiet
face
of
the
old
scholar
against
a
background
of
confusion
the
clear
calm
features
carved
as
in
ivory
and
set
with
a
light
upon
it
chaotic
darkness
behind
we
were
visiting
his
wife
when
he
came
out
from
the
inner
room
and
asked
if
he
might
talk
with
us
usually
to
such
a
question
i
say
no
we
have
come
to
the
women
who
are
far
the
more
needy
the
men
can
easily
hear
if
they
will
but
he
was
such
an
old
man
i
felt
i
could
not
refuse
so
he
began
to
tell
me
what
he
held
as
truth
which
was
in
brief
that
there
are
two
sets
of
attachment
one
outer
one
inner
that
deliverance
from
these
and
from
self
the
ego
which
regards
itself
as
the
doer
constitutes
holiness
that
is
that
one
must
be
completely
disentangled
and
completely
this
attained
the
next
is
bliss
which
is
progressive
first
comes
existence
in
the
same
place
as
god
second
nearness
to
god
third
likeness
to
god
fourth
identity
with
god
then
he
quoted
from
a
classic
beloved
by
all
the
old
tamil
school
stanza
after
stanza
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
above
ending
with
one
which
pope
has
thus
translated
thou
to
that
which
he
to
whom
nought
clings
hath
bid
thee
cling
cling
to
that
bond
to
get
thee
free
from
every
clinging
he
knew
sanscrit
and
read
me
passages
from
a
huge
ancient
book
and
then
in
return
for
a
booklet
he
gave
me
one
of
besant
translations
from
the
the
talk
ended
in
my
quoting
what
he
could
not
deny
was
the
true
of
one
of
his
greatest
poets
i
know
nothing
nothing
i
am
in
darkness
lord
is
there
no
light
for
me
and
another
from
the
poem
he
had
quoted
which
asks
the
question
what
is
the
use
of
knowledge
mere
knowledge
if
one
does
not
draw
near
to
the
one
and
this
led
into
what
he
would
not
listen
to
at
first
a
little
reading
from
the
book
of
books
before
whose
light
even
these
wonderful
books
pale
as
tapers
in
clear
sunshine
the
marvel
of
our
bible
never
shows
more
marvellous
than
at
such
times
when
you
see
it
in
deed
and
in
truth
the
sword
of
the
spirit
and
it
the
old
man
asked
me
to
come
again
and
i
did
as
the
iyer
was
away
he
often
got
out
of
my
depth
and
i
longed
to
know
more
but
i
always
found
the
bible
had
the
very
word
he
needed
if
he
would
only
take
it
so
far
as
i
know
he
did
not
and
i
left
him
to
quote
his
own
words
though
not
spoken
of
himself
alas
bewildered
by
numerous
thoughts
meshed
in
the
web
of
delusion
as
we
left
our
old
scholar
we
came
upon
a
thing
wholly
foolish
and
brainless
animalism
in
force
it
was
the
difference
between
the
classes
and
the
masses
once
for
all
painted
in
glare
a
huge
procession
was
tearing
along
the
streets
and
roads
with
all
the
usual
uproar
they
stopped
when
they
got
to
a
big
thorn
bush
and
then
danced
round
it
carrying
their
idols
raised
on
platforms
and
borne
by
two
or
three
dozen
to
each
we
passed
singing
as
hard
as
ever
we
could
victory
to
jesus
name
victory
and
when
we
got
rather
out
of
the
stream
stopped
and
sang
most
vigorously
till
quite
a
little
crowd
gathered
and
we
had
a
chance
to
witness
it
was
dark
and
the
flaming
torches
lit
up
the
wildest
most
barbaric
bit
of
heathenism
i
have
seen
for
a
long
time
the
great
black
moving
mass
seemed
like
some
hellish
sea
which
had
burst
its
bounds
and
the
hundreds
of
torches
moving
up
and
down
upon
it
like
lights
in
infernal
fishermen
boats
luring
lost
souls
to
their
doom
as
we
waited
and
spoke
to
those
who
would
hear
a
sudden
rush
from
the
centre
of
things
warned
us
to
go
but
before
we
could
get
out
of
the
way
a
rough
lad
with
a
torch
stuck
it
right
into
the
bandy
and
all
but
set
fire
to
us
he
ran
on
with
a
laugh
and
another
followed
with
an
idol
a
hideous
creature
red
and
white
which
he
also
pushed
in
upon
us
our
bullocks
trotted
as
fast
as
they
could
and
we
soon
got
out
of
it
all
and
looking
back
saw
the
great
square
of
the
devil
temple
blazing
with
torches
and
firebrands
and
heard
the
drummings
and
clangings
and
yells
which
announced
the
arrival
of
the
procession
all
that
night
the
riotous
drumming
continued
and
as
one
lay
awake
and
listened
one
pictured
the
old
scholar
sitting
in
the
cool
night
air
on
his
verandah
reading
his
ancient
books
by
the
light
of
the
little
lamp
in
the
niche
of
his
cottage
wall
chapter
xi
caste
viewed
as
a
doer
it
is
matter
for
especial
notice
that
in
every
department
of
applied
science
we
have
to
deal
with
the
unseen
all
forces
whether
in
physics
mechanics
or
electricity
are
invisible
mackay
the
division
of
the
tamil
people
over
fifteen
million
strong
into
classes
and
masses
though
convenient
and
simple
is
far
too
simple
to
be
of
value
in
giving
an
accurate
idea
of
the
matter
as
it
is
understood
from
within
as
we
said
it
is
only
an
outside
view
of
things
a
study
of
caste
from
an
indian
point
of
view
is
a
study
from
which
you
rise
bewildered
what
is
caste
what
is
electricity
lord
kelvin
said
on
the
occasion
of
his
jubilee
that
he
knew
no
more
of
electric
and
magnetic
force
than
he
knew
and
tried
to
teach
his
students
of
natural
philosophy
fifty
years
ago
in
his
first
session
as
professor
we
know
that
electricity
exists
we
are
conscious
of
its
presence
in
the
phenomena
of
light
heat
sound
but
we
do
not
know
what
it
is
nothing
could
more
perfectly
illustrate
caste
you
can
not
live
long
in
a
conservative
part
of
india
in
close
contact
with
its
people
without
being
conscious
of
its
presence
if
you
come
into
conflict
with
it
it
manifests
itself
in
a
flash
of
opposition
hot
rage
of
persecution
the
roar
of
the
tumult
of
the
crowd
but
try
to
define
it
and
you
find
you
can
not
do
it
it
is
not
merely
birth
class
a
code
of
rules
though
it
includes
all
these
it
is
a
force
an
energy
there
is
spirit
in
it
essence
hidden
as
the
invisible
essence
which
we
call
electricity
look
at
what
it
does
a
few
months
ago
a
boy
of
twelve
resolved
to
be
a
christian
his
clan
eight
thousand
strong
were
enraged
there
was
a
riot
in
the
streets
in
one
house
the
poison
cup
was
ready
better
death
than
loss
of
caste
in
another
town
a
boy
took
his
stand
and
was
baptised
thus
crossing
the
line
that
divides
secret
belief
from
open
confession
his
caste
men
got
hold
of
him
afterwards
next
time
he
was
seen
he
was
a
raving
lunatic
the
caste
was
avenged
it
may
be
someone
will
wonder
if
these
things
are
confined
to
one
part
of
the
field
so
i
quote
from
another
working
in
a
neighbouring
field
tamil
but
not
ours
she
tells
of
a
poor
woman
who
learned
in
her
home
and
believed
her
husband
also
believed
and
both
thought
of
becoming
christians
the
village
soothsayer
warned
them
that
their
father
god
would
be
angry
they
did
not
heed
him
but
went
on
and
suddenly
their
baby
died
this
was
too
much
for
their
faith
then
and
they
both
went
back
to
idolatry
a
few
years
afterwards
their
eldest
child
began
to
learn
to
read
and
the
mother
faith
revived
the
soothsayer
and
her
husband
reminded
her
of
the
infant
fate
but
she
was
brave
and
let
her
child
learn
then
her
cow
suddenly
died
did
we
not
tell
you
so
they
said
and
for
the
moment
she
was
staggered
but
she
rallied
and
only
became
more
earnest
in
faith
so
the
soothsayer
threatened
worse
illustration
cooking
in
a
house
of
the
shanar
caste
always
the
most
accessible
of
all
castes
here
but
this
is
a
specially
friendly
house
or
we
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
take
the
photo
the
small
girl
who
is
grinding
curry
stuff
on
the
stone
is
the
imp
of
chapter
xx
then
a
caste
meeting
was
called
to
determine
what
could
be
done
with
this
woman
the
husband
attended
the
meeting
and
was
treated
to
some
rice
and
curry
before
he
reached
home
he
was
taken
violently
ill
and
in
three
days
he
died
the
relatives
denounced
the
woman
as
the
cause
of
her
husband
death
took
her
only
son
from
her
and
entreated
her
to
return
to
her
father
gods
before
they
should
all
be
annihilated
they
gave
her
two
weeks
to
fast
and
mourn
for
her
husband
then
finding
her
mind
as
firmly
fixed
on
christ
as
before
they
sent
her
to
burmah
this
happened
recently
it
is
told
without
any
effort
to
appeal
to
the
sympathies
of
anyone
simply
as
a
fact
a
witness
every
line
of
it
to
the
power
of
caste
as
a
doer
but
there
is
something
in
the
tale
told
so
terribly
quietly
that
makes
one
heart
burn
with
indignation
at
the
unrelenting
cruelty
which
would
hound
a
poor
woman
down
and
send
her
bereft
of
all
she
loved
into
exile
such
as
a
foreign
land
would
be
to
one
who
knew
only
her
own
little
village
and
when
you
remember
the
caste
was
low
which
they
took
such
infinite
pains
to
guard
you
can
judge
perhaps
what
the
hate
would
be
the
concentration
of
scorn
and
hate
if
the
caste
were
higher
or
high
but
look
at
caste
in
another
way
in
its
power
in
the
commonplace
phases
of
life
for
example
take
a
kitchen
and
cooking
and
see
how
caste
rules
there
for
cooking
is
not
vulgar
work
or
in
any
sense
in
india
all
caste
women
in
good
orthodox
hindu
families
either
do
their
own
or
superintend
the
doing
of
it
by
younger
members
of
the
same
family
or
servants
of
the
same
caste
we
europeans
can
not
understand
the
extent
to
which
culinary
operations
may
be
associated
with
religion
the
kitchen
in
every
indian
household
is
a
kind
of
sanctuary
or
holy
ground
the
mere
glance
of
a
man
of
inferior
caste
makes
the
greatest
delicacies
uneatable
and
if
such
a
glance
happens
to
fall
on
the
family
supplies
during
the
cooking
operations
when
the
ceremonial
purity
of
the
water
used
is
a
matter
of
almost
life
and
death
to
every
member
of
the
household
the
whole
repast
has
to
be
thrown
away
as
if
poisoned
the
family
is
for
that
day
dinnerless
food
thus
contaminated
would
if
eaten
communicate
a
taint
to
the
souls
as
well
as
bodies
of
the
eaters
a
taint
which
could
only
be
removed
by
long
and
painful
expiation
thus
far
sir
monier
williams
quoted
as
a
greater
authority
than
any
mere
missionary
think
of
the
defilement
which
would
be
contracted
if
a
member
of
the
household
who
had
broken
caste
in
baptism
took
any
part
in
the
cooking
it
would
never
be
allowed
such
a
woman
could
take
no
share
in
the
family
life
her
presence
her
shadow
above
all
her
touch
would
be
simply
pollution
therefore
and
for
many
other
reasons
her
life
at
home
is
impossible
and
the
hindu
without
arguing
about
it
regards
it
as
impossible
it
does
not
enter
into
the
scheme
of
life
as
laid
down
by
the
rules
of
his
caste
he
never
if
he
is
orthodox
contemplates
it
for
a
moment
as
a
thing
to
be
even
desired
cooking
and
kitchen
work
may
seem
small
though
it
would
not
be
easy
for
even
the
greatest
to
live
without
reference
to
it
so
let
us
look
out
on
the
world
of
trade
and
see
caste
again
as
a
doer
there
if
a
merchant
becomes
a
christian
no
one
will
buy
his
goods
if
he
is
a
weaver
no
one
will
buy
his
cloth
if
he
is
a
dyer
no
one
will
buy
his
thread
if
he
is
a
jeweller
no
one
will
employ
him
if
it
is
remembered
that
every
particular
occupation
in
life
represents
a
particular
caste
it
will
be
easily
understood
how
matters
are
complicated
where
converts
from
the
great
trades
unions
are
concerned
hence
the
need
of
industrial
missions
and
the
fact
that
they
exist
a
man
wants
to
become
a
christian
say
from
the
blacksmith
or
carpenter
caste
as
a
christian
he
loses
his
trade
and
he
has
been
trained
to
no
other
his
forefathers
worked
in
iron
or
wood
and
he
can
not
attempt
to
learn
other
work
let
the
christians
employ
him
you
say
some
do
but
the
question
involves
other
questions
far
too
involved
for
discussion
here
and
even
if
we
discussed
it
we
should
probably
end
where
we
began
facing
a
practical
problem
which
no
one
can
hope
to
solve
while
caste
is
what
it
is
just
now
this
system
is
in
full
operation
in
the
case
of
a
lad
of
the
brassworker
caste
he
is
a
thoughtful
boy
and
he
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
christianity
is
the
true
religion
he
would
like
to
be
a
christian
if
the
conditions
were
a
little
easier
he
would
be
enrolled
as
an
inquirer
but
here
is
the
difficulty
his
father
is
not
strong
his
mother
and
little
sisters
and
brothers
are
his
care
if
he
were
a
christian
he
could
not
support
them
no
one
would
sell
him
brass
no
one
would
buy
the
vessels
he
makes
he
knows
only
his
inherited
trade
he
can
make
fine
lamps
vases
and
vessels
of
all
sorts
nothing
else
he
is
too
old
to
learn
any
other
trade
but
supposing
such
an
arrangement
could
be
made
who
would
support
the
family
in
the
meantime
perhaps
we
might
do
it
we
certainly
could
not
let
them
starve
but
it
would
not
do
to
tell
him
so
or
to
hold
out
hopes
of
earthly
help
till
we
know
beyond
a
doubt
that
he
is
true
this
is
what
is
holding
him
back
he
reads
over
and
over
again
he
that
loveth
father
or
mother
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
and
then
he
looks
at
his
father
and
mother
and
the
little
children
and
he
reads
the
verse
again
and
he
looks
at
them
again
it
is
too
hard
it
is
easy
enough
to
tell
him
that
god
would
take
care
of
them
if
he
obeys
we
do
tell
him
so
but
can
we
wonder
at
the
boy
for
hesitating
to
take
a
step
which
will
so
far
as
he
can
see
take
house
and
food
and
all
they
need
from
his
mother
and
those
little
children
these
are
some
of
the
things
which
make
work
in
india
what
is
simply
called
difficult
we
do
not
want
to
exaggerate
we
know
all
lands
have
their
difficulties
but
when
being
a
christian
means
all
this
over
and
above
what
it
means
elsewhere
then
the
bonds
which
bind
souls
are
visibly
strengthened
and
the
work
can
never
be
described
as
other
than
very
difficult
or
take
the
power
of
caste
in
another
direction
its
callous
cruelty
i
give
one
illustration
from
last
year
life
i
was
visiting
in
the
house
where
the
old
lady
lives
upon
whom
the
afflatus
fell
the
first
time
we
went
there
we
saw
a
little
lad
of
three
or
four
who
seemed
to
be
suffering
with
his
eyes
he
lay
in
a
swinging
bag
hung
from
the
roof
and
cried
piteously
all
the
time
we
were
there
now
two
months
afterwards
there
he
lay
crying
still
only
his
cries
were
so
weary
he
had
hardly
strength
to
cry
they
lifted
him
out
i
should
not
have
known
the
child
the
pretty
face
drawn
and
full
of
pain
the
little
hands
pressed
over
the
burning
eyes
only
one
who
has
had
it
knows
the
agony
of
ophthalmia
they
told
me
he
had
not
slept
not
even
the
measure
of
a
for
three
months
night
and
day
he
cried
and
cried
but
he
does
not
make
much
noise
now
they
added
he
could
poor
little
lad
i
begged
them
to
take
him
to
the
hospital
miles
away
but
they
said
to
go
to
a
hospital
was
against
their
caste
the
child
lay
moaning
so
pitifully
it
wrung
my
heart
and
i
pleaded
and
pleaded
with
them
to
let
me
take
him
if
they
would
not
even
if
his
sight
could
not
be
saved
something
could
be
done
to
ease
the
pain
i
knew
but
no
he
might
die
away
from
home
and
that
would
disgrace
their
caste
then
he
is
to
suffer
till
he
is
blind
or
dead
and
i
felt
half
wild
with
the
cold
cruelty
of
it
what
can
we
do
they
asked
can
we
destroy
our
caste
oh
i
did
blaze
out
for
a
moment
i
really
could
not
help
it
and
then
i
knelt
down
among
them
all
just
broken
with
the
pity
of
it
and
prayed
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
that
the
good
shepherd
would
come
and
gather
the
lamb
in
his
arms
i
wonder
if
you
can
bear
to
read
it
i
can
hardly
bear
to
write
it
but
you
have
not
seen
the
little
wasted
hands
pressed
over
the
eyes
and
then
falling
helplessly
too
tired
to
hold
up
any
longer
and
you
have
not
heard
those
weak
little
wails
and
to
think
it
need
not
have
been
but
we
could
do
nothing
we
were
leaving
the
place
next
day
and
even
if
we
could
have
helped
him
they
would
not
have
let
us
they
had
their
own
doctor
they
said
the
case
was
in
his
hands
as
we
came
away
they
explained
that
one
of
the
boy
distant
relatives
had
died
two
years
ago
and
that
this
was
what
prevented
any
of
them
leaving
the
house
as
some
obscure
caste
rule
would
be
broken
if
they
did
otherwise
they
might
have
been
able
to
take
him
somewhere
for
change
of
treatment
so
there
that
child
must
lie
in
his
pain
one
more
little
living
sacrifice
on
the
altar
of
caste
the
last
thing
i
heard
them
say
as
we
left
the
house
was
cry
softly
or
we
put
more
medicine
in
and
the
last
thing
i
saw
was
the
tightening
of
the
little
hands
over
the
poor
shut
eyes
as
he
tried
to
stifle
his
sobs
and
cry
softly
told
one
what
the
medicine
meant
to
one
of
the
things
they
had
put
in
was
raw
pepper
mixed
with
alum
is
not
caste
a
cruel
thing
those
women
were
not
heartless
but
they
would
rather
see
that
baby
die
in
torture
by
inches
than
dim
with
one
breath
the
lustre
of
their
brazen
escutcheon
of
caste
illustration
i
determined
not
to
laugh
that
was
what
she
said
when
she
saw
it
and
she
was
fairly
satisfied
with
the
result
of
her
efforts
the
jewels
are
gold
the
seeley
a
rich
red
a
woman
of
this
type
makes
a
fine
picture
the
strong
intelligent
face
the
perfect
arms
and
hands
the
glistening
gold
on
the
clear
brown
and
the
graceful
dress
harmonising
so
perfectly
with
the
colour
of
eyes
and
hair
the
one
deformity
is
the
ear
cut
so
as
to
hold
the
jewels
which
are
so
heavy
that
one
wonders
the
stretched
lobes
do
not
break
this
is
one
glimpse
of
one
phase
of
a
power
which
is
only
a
name
at
home
it
is
its
weakest
phase
for
the
hold
of
caste
upon
the
body
is
as
nothing
to
the
hold
it
has
upon
the
mind
and
soul
it
yields
to
the
touch
of
pain
sometimes
as
our
medical
missionaries
know
but
it
tightens
again
too
often
when
the
need
for
relief
is
past
it
is
unspeakably
strong
unmercifully
cruel
and
yet
it
would
seem
as
though
the
very
blood
of
the
people
ran
red
with
it
is
in
part
of
their
very
being
this
then
is
caste
viewed
as
a
doer
it
does
strange
things
hard
things
things
most
cruel
it
is
all
who
fight
it
are
agreed
the
strongest
foe
to
the
gospel

christ

the

this
work
in
india
is
one
of
the
most
crucial
tests
the
church
of
christ
has
ever
been
put
to
the
people
you
think
to
measure
your
forces
against
are
such
as
the
giant
races
of
canaan
are
nothing
to
french
india
and
it
was
very
hot
and
we
were
tired
and
the
friendly
voice
calling
come
in
come
in
oh
come
and
rest
was
a
welcome
sound
and
we
went
in
she
was
a
dear
old
friend
of
mine
the
only
real
friend
i
have
in
that
ancient
hindu
town
her
house
is
always
open
to
us
the
upper
room
always
empty
or
said
to
be
so
when
we
are
needing
a
rest
but
she
is
a
hindu
of
the
hindus
and
though
so
enlightened
that
for
love
sake
she
touches
us
freely
taking
our
hands
in
hers
and
even
kissing
us
after
we
go
there
is
a
general
purification
every
scrap
of
clothing
worn
while
we
were
in
the
house
is
carefully
washed
before
sunset
she
insisted
now
upon
feeding
us
called
for
plantains
and
sugar
broke
up
the
plantains
dabbed
the
pulp
in
the
sugar
and
commanded
us
to
eat
then
she
sat
down
satisfied
and
was
photographed
this
town
a
little
ancient
hindu
town
is
two
hours
journey
from
dohnavur
there
are
stone
temples
and
shrines
in
and
around
it
and
five
hundred
altars
no
one
has
counted
the
number
of
idols
there
are
two
hundred
under
a
single
tree
near
one
of
the
smaller
shrines
each
of
the
larger
temples
has
its
attendant
there
are
two
hundred
recognised
servants
of
the
gods
and
two
hundred
annual
festivals
wonderful
sums
are
being
worked
just
now
concerning
the
progress
of
christianity
in
india
a
favourite
sum
is
stated
thus
the
number
of
christians
has
increased
during
the
last
decade
at
a
certain
ratio
given
the
continuance
of
this
uniform
rate
of
increase
it
will
follow
that
within
a
computable
period
india
will
be
a
christian
land
one
flaw
in
this
method
of
calculation
is
that
it
takes
for
granted
that
brahmans
hindus
and
mohammedans
will
be
christianised
at
the
same
rate
of
progress
as
prevails
at
present
among
the
depressed
classes
there
are
sums
less
frequently
stated
here
in
the
heart
of
this
hindu
town
they
come
with
force
one
such
sum
worked
out
carefully
shows
that
according
to
the
present
rate
of
advance
it
will
be
more
than
twenty
thousand
years
before
the
hindu
towns
of
this
district
are
even
nominally
christian
another
still
more
startling
gives
us
this
result
according
to
the
laws
which
govern
statistics
thirteen
hundred
thousand
years
must
pass
before
the
brahmans
in
this
one
south
indian
district
are
christianised
and
if
the
sum
is
worked
so
as
to
cover
all
india
the
result
is
quite
as
staggering
to
faith
based
on
statistics
praise
god
this
is
not
his
arithmetic
it
is
a
purely
human
invention
we
believe
in
the
holy
ghost
the
lord
and
giver
of
life
we
believe
in
god
even
god
who
calleth
the
things
that
are
not
as
though
they
were
therefore
these
sums
prove
nothing
but
if
such
sums
are
worked
at
all
they
ought
to
be
worked
on
both
sides
and
not
only
on
the
side
which
yields
the
most
encouraging
results
two
of
us
spent
a
morning
in
the
brahman
street
in
these
old
hindu
towns
the
brahman
street
is
built
round
the
temple
and
in
large
towns
this
street
is
a
thoroughfare
and
we
are
allowed
in
the
women
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
cool
little
dark
verandahs
and
we
stood
out
in
the
sun
and
tried
to
make
friends
with
them
then
some
mission
college
boys
saw
us
and
felt
ashamed
that
we
should
stand
in
that
blazing
heat
and
they
offered
us
a
verandah
but
the
women
instantly
cleared
off
and
the
men
came
and
the
boys
besought
us
under
their
breath
to
say
nothing
about
our
religion
we
spoke
for
a
few
minutes
throwing
our
whole
soul
into
the
chance
we
felt
that
our
words
were
as
feathers
floating
against
rocks
but
we
witnessed
and
they
listened
till
as
one
of
them
remarked
it
was
time
to
go
for
their
noontide
bathe
and
we
knew
they
wished
us
to
go
we
went
then
and
found
a
wall
at
the
head
of
the
brahman
street
and
we
stood
in
its
shadow
and
tried
again
crowds
of
men
and
lads
gathered
about
us
but
our
college
boys
stood
by
our
side
and
helped
to
quiet
them
now
you
see
they
said
to
us
as
they
walked
with
us
down
the
outer
street
how
quite
impossible
for
us
is
christianity
it
is
good
sometimes
to
take
time
to
take
in
the
might
of
the
foe
we
fight
that
evening
two
of
us
had
a
quiet
few
minutes
under
the
temple
walls
those
great
walls
reaching
so
high
above
us
stretching
so
far
beyond
us
seemed
a
type
of
the
wall
satan
has
built
round
these
souls
we
could
touch
this
visible
wall
press
against
it
feel
its
solid
strength
run
hard
against
it
and
you
would
be
hurt
you
might
fall
back
bleeding
it
would
not
have
yielded
one
inch
and
the
other
invisible
wall
oh
we
can
touch
it
too
is
a
real
thing
and
so
is
but
the
wall
it
still
stands
strong
it
was
moonlight
we
had
walked
all
round
the
great
temple
square
down
the
silent
brahman
streets
and
we
had
stood
in
the
pillared
hall
and
looked
across
to
the
open
door
and
seen
the
light
on
the
shrine
now
we
were
out
in
god
clean
light
looking
up
at
the
mass
of
the
tower
as
it
rose
against
the
sky
and
we
felt
how
small
we
were
then
the
influences
of
the
place
began
to
take
hold
of
us
it
was
not
only
masonry
it
was
mystery
the
sovereigns
of
this
present
darkness
were
there
how
futile
all
of
earth
seemed
then
against
those
tremendous
forces
and
powers
what
seemed
all
weapons
of
the
flesh
praise
god
for
the
holy
ghost
while
we
were
sitting
there
a
brahman
came
to
see
what
we
were
doing
and
we
told
him
some
of
our
thoughts
he
asked
us
then
if
we
would
care
to
hear
his
we
told
him
gladly
he
pointed
up
to
the
temple
tower
that
is
my
first
step
to
god
we
listened
and
he
unfolded
thought
by
thought
that
strange
old
védic
philosophy
which
holds
that
god
being
omnipresent
reveals
himself
in
various
ways
in
visible
forms
in
incarnations
or
in
spirit
the
method
of
revelation
is
the
lowest
it
is
only
as
it
were
the
first
of
a
series
of
steps
which
lead
up
to
the
highest
intelligent
adoration
of
and
absorption
into
the
one
supreme
spirit
we
are
only
little
children
yet
we
take
this
small
first
step
it
crumbles
beneath
us
as
we
rise
to
the
next
and
so
step
by
step
we
rise
from
the
visible
to
the
invisible
from
matter
to
spirit
to
god
but
he
added
courteously
as
my
faith
is
good
for
me
so
doubtless
you
find
yours
for
you
next
morning
we
went
down
to
the
river
and
had
talks
with
the
people
who
passed
on
their
way
to
the
town
it
was
all
so
pretty
in
the
early
morning
light
men
were
washing
their
bullocks
and
children
were
scampering
in
and
out
of
the
water
farther
downstream
the
women
were
bathing
their
babies
and
polishing
their
brass
trees
met
overhead
but
the
light
broke
through
in
places
and
made
yellow
patches
on
the
water
out
in
one
of
those
reaches
of
yellow
a
girl
stood
bending
to
fill
her
vessel
she
wore
the
common
crimson
of
the
south
but
the
light
struck
it
and
struck
the
shining
brass
as
she
swung
it
up
under
her
arm
and
made
her
into
a
picture
as
she
stood
in
her
clinging
wet
red
things
against
the
brown
and
green
of
water
and
wood
everywhere
we
looked
there
was
something
beautiful
to
look
at
and
all
about
us
was
the
sound
of
voices
and
laughter
and
the
musical
splashing
of
water
then
as
we
enjoyed
it
all
we
saw
this
under
an
ancient
tree
fifteen
men
were
walking
slowly
round
and
round
following
the
course
of
the
sun
under
the
tree
there
were
numbers
of
idols
and
piles
of
oleander
and
jessamin
wreaths
brought
fresh
that
morning
the
men
were
elderly
men
they
were
wholly
engrossed
in
what
they
were
doing
it
was
no
foolish
farce
to
them
it
was
reality
there
is
something
in
the
sight
of
this
ordinary
evident
dethronement
of
our
god
which
stirs
one
to
one
inmost
soul
we
could
not
look
at
it
again
and
again
we
have
gone
to
that
town
but
those
men
go
round
that
tree
and
that
town
is
a
fort
unwon
petra
i
have
called
it
the
word
stands
for
many
a
town
walled
in
as
that
one
is
in
keith
of
there
is
a
map
of
petra
the
old
strong
city
of
edom
and
in
studying
it
a
light
fell
upon
david
question
concerning
it
and
his
own
triumphant
answer
who
will
lead
me
into
the
strong
city
who
will
bring
me
into
edom
wilt
not
thou
o
god
for
the
map
shows
the
mountains
all
round
except
at
the
east
where
they
break
into
a
single
narrow
passage
the
one
way
in
there
was
only
one
way
in
but
there
that
one
way
in
here
is
a
town
walled
up
to
heaven
by
walls
of
caste
and
bigotry
but
there
must
be
one
way
in
here
is
a
soul
walled
all
round
by
utter
indifference
and
pride
but
there
must
be
one
way
in
who
will
lead
me
into
the
strong
city
who
will
bring
me
into
edom
not
thou
o
god
chapter
xiii
death
by
disuse
there
is
a
strong
tendency
to
look
upon
the
atonement
of
christ
as
possessing
some
quality
by
virtue
of
which
god
can
excuse
and
overlook
sin
in
the
christian
a
readiness
to
look
upon
sinning
as
the
inevitable
accompaniment
of
human
nature
death
do
us
part
and
to
look
upon
christianity
as
a
substitute
for
rather
than
a
cause
of
personal
holiness
of
life
charlton
from
many
things
i
have
heard
i
fancy
many
at
home
think
of
the
mission
as
a
sort
of
little
heaven
upon
earth
but
when
one
looks
under
the
surface
there
is
much
to
sadden
one
oh
friends
much
prayer
is
needed
many
of
the
agents
know
apparently
nothing
about
conversion
you
may
not
like
my
writing
so
plainly
but
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
only
the
bright
side
were
given
and
one
feels
that
if
god
praying
people
at
home
understood
things
more
as
they
really
are
more
prayer
for
an
outpouring
of
the
holy
spirit
on
our
agents
and
converts
would
ascend
to
god
we
do
long
to
see
all
our
pastors
and
agents
really
converted
men
men
of
prayer
and
faith
who
knowing
that
they
themselves
are
saved
long
with
a
great
longing
to
see
the
heathen
round
them
brought
out
of
darkness
into
his
light
and
the
christians
who
form
their
congregations
earnest
converted
men
and
women
carr
fifty
added
to
the
church
sounds
fine
at
home
but
if
only
five
of
them
are
genuine
what
will
it
profit
in
the
great
day
livingstone
oh
for
the
fire
to
set
the
whole
alight
and
melt
us
all
into
one
mighty
church
apperson
the
lamps
were
being
lighted
the
drums
beaten
the
cymbals
struck
and
the
horns
blown
for
evening
pujah
in
all
the
larger
temples
and
shrines
of
the
strong
city
when
we
turned
out
of
it
and
crossing
the
stream
that
divides
the
two
places
went
to
the
christian
hamlet
which
by
contrast
at
that
moment
seemed
like
a
little
corner
of
the
garden
of
the
lord
behind
was
the
heathenish
clash
and
clang
of
every
possible
discord
and
here
the
steady
ringing
of
the
bell
for
evening
service
behind
was
all
that
ever
was
meant
by
the
mystery
of
iniquity
and
here
the
purity
and
peace
of
christianity
this
is
how
it
struck
me
at
first
and
even
now
after
a
spell
of
work
in
the
heart
of
heathendom
christendom
or
the
bit
of
it
lying
alongside
is
beautiful
by
contrast
there
you
have
naked
death
death
unadorned
the
corpse
exhibited
here
if
there
is
a
corpse
at
least
it
is
decently
dressed
and
yet
that
evening
it
was
forced
upon
me
that
death
is
death
wherever
found
and
however
carefully
covered
illustration
i
do
feel
so
shy
she
was
just
on
the
point
of
saying
to
me
by
the
way
of
appeal
to
be
released
when
the
camera
clicked
and
she
was
caught
widows
do
not
wear
jewels
as
a
rule
among
the
hindus
of
the
higher
castes
but
christians
do
as
they
like
she
is
a
village
woman
of
fairly
good
position
the
first
of
the
christians
to
welcome
us
was
a
widow
this
is
her
photograph
we
soon
made
friends
she
told
us
she
had
been
born
in
the
way
her
grandfather
joined
it
and
none
of
the
family
had
gone
back
so
she
was
sure
that
all
was
right
we
were
not
so
sure
and
we
tried
to
find
out
if
she
knew
the
difference
between
joining
the
way
and
coming
to
christ
this
was
only
a
poor
little
country
hamlet
but
everywhere
we
have
travelled
among
educated
and
uneducated
alike
we
have
found
much
confusion
of
thought
upon
this
subject
god
knows
my
heart
she
said
god
hears
my
prayers
if
i
see
a
bad
dream
in
the
night
i
pray
to
god
and
putting
a
bible
under
my
head
i
sleep
in
perfect
peace
could
anything
be
more
conclusive
there
were
numbers
of
other
proofs
forthcoming
if
your
grandfather
gave
six
lamps
to
the
church
value
three
and
a
half
rupees
each
the
lamps
are
hanging
and
bear
witness
to
the
fact
if
your
father
never
failed
to
pay
his
yearly
dues
besides
regular
sunday
collections
his
name
is
in
the
church
report
and
how
much
he
gave
is
printed
if
you
freely
help
the
poor
and
give
them
paddy
on
christmas
day
quite
a
sackful
of
it
if
you
never
offer
to
demons
no
not
when
your
children
are
sick
and
the
other
faithless
christians
advise
you
if
you
never
tie
on
the
cylinder
a
charm
frequently
though
covertly
worn
by
purely
nominal
christians
and
finally
if
you
have
been
baptised
and
confirmed
and
without
a
break
join
the
surely
no
one
can
reasonably
doubt
that
you
are
a
christian
of
a
very
proper
sort
as
to
questions
about
change
of
heart
and
chronic
indulgence
in
sins
such
as
lying
who
in
this
wicked
world
lives
without
lying
and
when
it
pleases
god
to
do
it
he
will
change
your
heart
we
took
the
evening
meeting
for
the
villagers
who
meanwhile
had
gathered
and
were
listening
with
approval
privacy
as
we
understand
it
is
a
thing
unknown
in
india
that
is
right
they
remarked
cheerfully
give
her
plenty
of
good
advice
and
we
all
trooped
into
the
once
in
there
everyone
put
on
a
sort
of
church
expression
and
each
one
took
his
or
her
accustomed
seat
in
decorous
silence
the
little
sat
in
rows
in
front
on
the
mats
with
arms
demurely
folded
and
sparkling
eyes
fixed
solemnly
the
people
sat
on
their
mats
on
either
side
behind
and
we
sat
on
ours
facing
them
we
began
with
a
chorus
which
the
children
picked
up
quickly
and
shouted
lustily
the
joining
in
with
more
reserve
and
then
we
got
to
work
blessing
spoke
she
had
once
been
a
nominal
christian
and
she
knew
exactly
where
these
people
were
and
how
they
looked
at
things
her
heart
was
greatly
moved
as
she
spoke
and
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
for
she
knew
none
of
these
friends
had
the
joy
of
conscious
salvation
and
she
told
me
afterwards
she
had
thirst
and
hunger
for
them
but
they
listened
unimpressed
then
we
had
prayer
and
a
quiet
time
sometimes
the
spirit
works
most
in
quiet
and
we
rose
expectantly
but
there
was
no
sign
of
life
after
the
meeting
was
over
they
gathered
round
us
again
they
are
always
so
loving
and
friendly
in
these
little
villages
but
they
could
not
understand
what
it
was
that
troubled
us
were
they
not
all
shortly
afterwards
they
came
as
their
kindly
custom
is
to
bring
us
fruit
and
wreaths
of
flowers
on
new
year
day
i
missed
my
first
friend
of
that
evening
and
asked
for
her
that
widow
you
talked
to
said
the
old
catechist
three
days
ago
fever
seized
her
and
he
broke
off
and
looked
up
then
i
longed
to
hear
how
she
had
died
but
no
one
could
tell
me
anything
oh
the
curtain
of
silence
that
covers
the
passing
of
souls
we
went
soon
afterwards
to
the
village
sure
that
at
last
the
people
would
be
stirred
for
she
had
been
a
leader
among
the
women
and
her
call
even
in
this
land
of
sudden
calls
had
been
very
sudden
but
we
did
not
find
it
had
affected
anyone
they
all
referred
to
her
in
the
chastened
tone
adopted
upon
such
occasions
and
sighing
reminded
each
other
that
god
was
merciful
and
she
had
always
been
up
to
the
measure
of
her
ability
a
very
good
woman
we
felt
as
if
we
were
standing
with
each
one
of
those
people
separately
in
the
one
little
standing
space
we
were
sure
of
before
that
curtain
and
we
spoke
with
them
as
you
speak
with
those
whom
you
know
you
may
never
see
again
on
this
side
of
it
but
they
looked
at
us
and
wondered
what
was
the
matter
with
us
were
they
not
did
they
not
believe
in
god
did
they
not
pray
regularly
night
and
morning
for
forgiveness
protection
and
blessing
so
they
could
not
understand
was
it
that
the
power
to
understand
had
been
withered
up
within
them
was
the
soul
god
gave
them
dead
sentenced
to
death
by
disuse
dead
they
are
in
apathy
and
ignorance
and
putrefying
customs
and
the
false
security
that
comes
from
adherence
to
the
christian
creed
without
vital
connection
with
christ
these
poor
christians
are
dead
why
should
it
be
thought
a
thing
incredible
with
you
that
god
should
raise
the
dead
lord
it
is
not
a
thing
incredible
thou
hast
done
it
before
oh
do
it
again
do
it
soon
i
have
told
you
how
much
we
need
your
help
for
the
work
among
the
heathen
but
often
we
feel
we
need
it
almost
as
much
for
the
work
among
the
christians
over
and
over
again
it
is
told
but
still
it
is
hardly
understood
that
the
christians
need
to
be
converted
that
the
vast
majority
are
not
converted
that
statistics
may
mislead
and
do
not
stand
for
eternity
work
that
many
a
pastor
catechist
teacher
has
a
name
to
live
but
is
dead
that
the
church
is
very
dead
as
a
whole
thank
god
for
every
exception
we
do
not
say
this
thoughtlessly
the
words
are
a
grief
to
write
we
humble
ourselves
that
it
is
so
and
take
to
ourselves
the
blame
it
is
true
that
the
corpse
of
the
dead
church
is
dressed
just
as
it
is
at
home
only
here
it
is
even
more
dressed
and
because
the
spirit
of
the
land
is
intensely
religious
its
are
vestments
but
dressed
death
is
still
death
this
will
come
as
a
shock
to
those
who
have
read
stories
of
this
or
that
native
christian
and
generalising
from
these
stories
picture
the
church
as
a
company
of
saints
god
has
his
saints
in
india
men
and
women
hidden
away
in
quiet
places
out
of
sight
and
some
few
out
in
the
front
but
the
cry
of
our
hearts
is
for
more
so
we
tell
you
the
truth
about
things
as
they
are
though
we
know
it
will
not
be
acceptable
for
the
best
is
the
thing
that
is
best
liked
at
home
so
the
best
is
most
frequently
written
this
may
seem
to
cross
out
what
was
said
before
about
the
darker
side
of
the
truth
being
often
told
it
does
not
cross
it
out
read
through
the
magazines
and
reports
and
you
will
find
sentences
which
show
facts
to
those
who
have
eyes
to
see
but
though
this
is
so
all
will
admit
that
the
sanguine
view
as
it
is
called
is
by
far
the
most
in
evidence
for
the
sanguine
man
is
by
far
the
most
popular
writer
and
so
is
more
pressed
to
write
people
will
read
what
is
buoyant
and
bright
the
more
of
that
sort
we
have
the
better
wrote
a
mission
secretary
out
in
the
field
not
long
ago
to
a
missionary
who
did
not
feel
free
to
write
in
quite
that
way
those
who
to
quote
another
secretary
are
afraid
of
writing
at
all
for
fear
of
telling
lies
excuse
the
energetic
language
i
am
quoting
not
inventing
naturally
write
much
less
and
so
the
best
gets
known
this
is
nobody
fault
exactly
the
home
authorities
print
for
the
most
part
what
is
sent
to
them
they
even
call
attention
sometimes
to
the
less
cheerful
view
of
things
and
if
yielding
occasionally
to
the
pressure
which
is
brought
to
bear
upon
them
by
a
public
which
loves
to
hear
what
it
likes
they
take
the
sting
out
of
some
strong
paragraph
by
adding
an
editorial
nevertheless
is
it
very
astonishing
do
you
think
we
are
writing
like
this
because
we
are
discouraged
no
we
are
not
discouraged
except
when
sometimes
we
fear
lest
you
should
grow
weary
in
prayer
before
the
answer
comes
this
india
is
god
india
this
work
is
his
oh
join
with
us
then
as
we
join
with
all
our
dear
indian
brothers
and
sisters
who
are
alive
in
the
lord
in
waiting
upon
him
in
that
intensest
form
of
waiting
waits
on
till
the
answer
join
with
us
as
we
pray
to
the
mighty
god
of
revivals
o
lord
revive
thy
work
revive
thy
work
in
the
midst
of

chapter
xiv
what
happened
some
years
ago
england
was
stirred
through
and
through
by
revelations
which
were
made
as
to
the
cry
of
wronged
womanhood
in
india
the
bitter
cry
is
far
more
bitter
but
it
is
stifled
and
smothered
by
the
cruel
gag
of
caste
orthodox
hindus
would
rather
see
their
girls
betrayed
tortured
murdered
than
suffer
them
to
break
through
the
trammels
of
caste
walker
there
is
another
ancient
town
near
dohnavur
and
in
that
town
another
temple
and
round
the
temple
the
usual
brahman
square
in
one
of
the
streets
of
this
square
we
saw
the
girl
whose
face
looks
out
at
you
it
struck
us
as
a
typical
face
not
beautiful
as
many
are
but
characteristic
in
the
latent
power
of
eyes
and
brow
a
face
full
of
possibilities
illustration
here
is
one
who
might
be
a
queen
what
she
be
is
very
different
she
is
a
brahman
girl
all
her
people
are
hindus
she
has
never
even
felt
a
desire
or
seen
any
one
in
her
town
who
felt
a
desire
to
fall
into
the
pit
of
christianity
we
were
rarely
able
to
get
anything
we
specially
wanted
but
we
got
this
i
look
at
it
now
and
wonder
how
it
will
develop
as
the
soul
behind
it
shapes
and
grows
that
child
is
enfolded
in
influences
which
ward
off
the
touch
of
the
grace
of
life
we
saw
numbers
of
women
that
day
but
only
at
the
distance
of
a
street
breadth
they
would
not
come
nearer
for
the
town
is
still
a
petra
to
us
we
are
waiting
to
be
led
in
but
if
we
were
able
to
get
in
enough
to
take
a
photograph
surely
we
were
in
enough
to
preach
the
gospel
why
not
stop
and
there
speak
of
more
important
matters
what
was
to
hinder
only
this
in
that
town
they
have
heard
of
converts
coming
out
and
breaking
caste
in
baptism
and
they
have
made
a
law
that
we
with
whom
they
know
some
of
these
converts
are
shall
never
be
allowed
to
speak
to
any
of
their
women
that
hindered
us
there
but
even
supposing
we
had
been
free
to
speak
as
we
trust
we
shall
be
soon
and
supposing
she
had
wanted
to
hear
the
barriers
which
lie
between
such
a
child
and
confession
of
christ
are
so
many
and
so
great
that
when
as
now
one
wants
to
tell
you
about
them
one
hardly
knows
how
to
do
it
words
seem
like
little
feeble
shadows
of
some
grim
rock
like
little
feeble
shadows
of
the
grasses
growing
on
it
rather
than
of
in
its
solidity
or
to
revert
to
the
old
thought
all
one
can
say
is
just
pointing
to
the
dust
as
evidence
of
the
actual
what
is
to
hinder
women
from
being
baptised
and
living
as
christians
in
their
own
homes
the
question
was
asked
by
an
englishman
a
winter
visitor
who
being
interested
in
missions
was
gathering
impressions
we
told
him
no
woman
would
be
allowed
to
live
as
an
open
christian
in
her
own
home
and
we
told
him
of
some
who
only
because
they
were
suspected
of
inclining
towards
christianity
had
been
caused
to
disappear
what
do
you
suppose
happened
to
them
he
asked
and
we
told
him
we
were
talking
in
the
pleasant
of
an
indian
hotel
our
friend
smiled
and
assured
us
we
must
be
mistaken
we
were
under
the
english
government
such
things
could
not
be
possible
we
looked
round
the
quiet
room
with
its
air
of
english
comfort
and
english
safety
we
looked
at
the
quiet
faces
faces
that
had
never
looked
at
fear
and
we
hardly
wondered
that
they
could
not
understand
then
in
a
moment
even
as
they
talked
we
were
far
away
in
another
room
looking
at
other
faces
faces
unquiet
very
full
of
fear
we
knew
that
all
round
us
for
streets
and
streets
there
were
only
the
foes
of
our
lord
we
knew
that
a
cry
that
was
raised
for
help
would
be
drowned
long
before
it
could
escape
through
those
many
streets
to
the
great
english
house
outside
there
were
policemen
you
say
but
policemen
in
india
are
not
as
at
home
can
be
and
now
we
are
looking
in
again
there
is
a
very
dark
inner
room
no
window
one
small
door
the
walls
are
solid
so
is
the
door
if
you
cried
in
there
who
would
hear
and
now
we
are
listening
someone
is
speaking
once
there
was
one
she
cared
for
your
god
she
was
buried
into
the
wall
in
there
and
that
was
the
end
of
her
but
we
are
back
in
the
hearing
them
tell
us
these
things
could
never
be
three
years
passed
and
a
girl
came
for
refuge
to
us
she
loved
her
people
well
she
would
never
have
come
to
us
had
they
let
her
live
as
a
christian
at
home
but
no
rather
than
that
she
shall
burn
they
said
we
were
doubtful
about
her
age
and
we
feared
we
should
have
to
give
her
up
if
the
case
came
on
in
the
courts
and
if
we
had
to
give
her
up
we
looked
at
the
gentle
trustful
face
and
we
could
not
bear
the
thought
and
yet
according
to
our
friends
the
government
made
all
safe
about
that
time
a
paper
came
to
the
house
names
dates
means
of
identification
all
were
given
this
was
the
story
in
brief
a
young
brahman
girl
in
another
south
indian
town
wanted
to
be
a
christian
and
confessed
christ
at
home
she
earnestly
wished
to
be
baptised
but
she
was
too
young
then
and
waited
learning
steadily
and
continuing
faithful
though
everything
was
done
that
could
be
done
to
turn
her
from
her
purpose
she
was
betrothed
against
her
will
to
her
cousin
and
forbidden
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
christians
she
was
never
allowed
to
go
out
alone
and
was
practically
a
prisoner
for
three
years
that
child
held
on
witnessing
steadfastly
at
home
and
letting
it
be
clearly
known
that
she
was
and
would
be
a
christian
a
hindu
ceremony
of
importance
in
the
family
was
held
in
her
house
and
she
refused
to
go
this
brought
things
to
a
crisis
her
people
appointed
a
council
of
five
to
investigate
the
matter
she
maintained
a
glorious
witness
before
them
all
says
the
missionary
declared
boldly
that
she
was
a
christian
and
intended
to
join
us
and
when
challenged
about
the
bible
she
held
it
out
and
read
it
to
the
assembled
people
for
a
time
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
won
the
day
but
fresh
attempts
were
made
upon
her
constancy
by
certain
religious
bigots
of
the
town
they
offered
her
jewels
that
failed
tried
to
get
her
to
turn
mussulman
that
being
less
disgraceful
than
to
be
a
christian
and
last
and
worst
tried
to
stain
that
white
soul
black
but
thank
god
still
they
failed
at
last
the
waiting
time
was
over
she
was
of
age
to
be
baptised
and
she
wrote
to
tell
her
missionary
friend
about
it
he
sent
her
books
to
read
and
promised
to
let
her
know
within
two
days
what
he
could
arrange
to
do
her
letter
was
dated
from
her
grandfather
house
the
missionary
writes
to
which
she
said
she
had
been
sent
and
put
in
a
room
alone
on
the
following
day
hearing
a
rumour
of
her
death
i
went
to
house
and
there
found
her
body
outside
the
door
i
caused
it
to
be
seized
by
the
police
and
the
has
revealed
the
fact
that
the
poor
child
was
poisoned
by
arsenic
bribes
have
been
freely
used
and
atrocious
lies
have
been
told
and
the
net
result
of
all
the
police
inquiries
so
far
is
that
no
charge
can
be
brought
against
anyone
last
year
we
met
one
of
the
missionaries
from
this
mission
on
the
hills
and
we
asked
him
if
anyone
had
been
convicted
he
said
no
one
had
been
convicted
the
caste
had
seen
to
that
here
then
is
a
statement
of
facts
divested
of
all
emotion
or
sensationalism
a
child
is
shut
up
in
a
room
alone
and
poisoned
when
she
is
dead
her
body
is
thrown
outside
the
door
it
was
found
have
been
bodies
which
have
not
been
but
we
are
under
the
british
government
nothing
can
have
happened
to
them
the
british
government
does
much
but
it
can
not
do
everything
it
is
notorious
in
india
that
false
witnesses
can
be
bought
at
so
much
a
head
according
to
the
nature
of
witness
required
bribery
and
corruption
are
not
mere
names
here
but
facts
most
difficult
for
any
straightforward
official
to
trace
and
track
and
deal
with
we
know
and
everyone
knows
that
the
white
man
government
though
strong
enough
to
win
and
rule
this
empire
is
weak
as
a
white
child
when
it
stands
outside
the
door
of
an
indian
house
and
wants
to
know
what
has
gone
on
inside
or
proposes
to
regulate
what
shall
go
on
it
can
not
do
it
the
thought
is
vain
why
not
have
her
put
under
surveillance
asked
a
friend
a
military
man
about
a
certain
girl
who
wanted
to
be
a
christian
as
if
such
surveillance
were
practicable
or
ever
could
be
under
such
conditions
as
obtain
in
hindu
and
mohammedan
circles
except
in
places
directly
under
the
eye
of
government
we
know
there
are
houses
where
at
an
hour
notice
any
kind
and
any
strength
of
poison
can
be
prepared
and
administered
quick
poison
to
kill
within
a
few
minutes
slow
poisons
that
undermine
the
constitution
and
do
their
work
so
safely
that
no
one

find
it
out
brain
poisons
worse
than
either
and
perhaps
more
commonly
used
as
they
are
as
effective
and
much
less
dangerous
but
we
could
not
prove
what
we
know
and
knowledge
without
proof
is
legally
speaking
valueless
and
yet
we
know
these
things
we
have
heard
a
cry
of
tears
we
have
heard
a
cry
of

tears
and
blood
have
a
cry
that
pierces

god
hears
their
cry

tarry

chapter
xv
simply
murdered
that
word
so
often
on
paul
lips
what
did
it
mean
did
it
not
just
mean
the
thousand
wearinesses
and
deeper
the
strivings
the
travailings
the
bitter
disappointments
the
oft
of
a
missionary
life
robert
stewart
there
are
worse
things
than
martyrdom
there
are
some
who
are
simply
murdered
there
is
one
who
belongs
to
a
caste
which
more
than
any
other
is
considered
tolerant
and
safe
men
converts
from
this
caste
can
live
at
home
and
if
a
husband
and
wife
believe
they
may
continue
living
in
their
own
house
among
the
heathen
and
yet
this
is
what
happened
to
a
girl
because
it
was
known
that
she
wanted
to
be
a
christian
first
persecution
treasure
as
her
name
may
be
translated
had
learnt
as
a
child
in
the
little
mission
school
and
when
we
went
to
her
village
she
responded
and
took
her
stand
she
refused
to
take
part
in
a
hindu
ceremony
she
was
beaten
at
first
slightly
then
severely
this
failed
so
they
sent
her
out
of
our
reach
to
a
heathen
village
miles
away
this
also
failed
and
she
was
brought
home
and
for
some
months
went
steadily
on
reading
and
learning
when
she
could
and
all
the
time
brightly
witnessing
she
was
a
joy
to
us
she
was
very
anxious
to
come
out
and
be
baptised
but
her
age
was
the
difficulty
when
a
convert
comes
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
let
the
police
authorities
know
they
send
a
constable
who
takes
down
the
convert
deposition
which
is
then
forwarded
to
headquarters
one
of
the
first
questions
concerns
age
in
some
cases
a
medical
certificate
is
demanded
and
the
girl
fate
turns
on
that
if
we
can
get
one
for
over
sixteen
we
are
safe
from
prosecution
in
the
criminal
courts
but
eighteen
is
the
safest
age
as
the
civil
courts
if
the
case
were
to
proceed
would
force
us
to
give
her
up
if
she
were
under
eighteen
the
difficulty
of
proving
the
age
unless
the
girl
is
evidently
well
over
it
is
very
serious
the
medical
certificate
usually
takes
off
a
year
from
what
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
is
the
true
age
one
other
proof
remains
the
horoscope
this
is
a
hindu
document
written
on
a
palm
leaf
at
the
birth
of
the
child
but
it
is
always
carefully
kept
by
the
head
of
the
family
and
so
as
a
rule
unobtainable
when
a
case
comes
on
in
court
a
false
horoscope
may
be
produced
by
the
relatives
this
was
done
in
a
recent
case
tried
in
our
courts
so
we
can
not
count
upon
that
in
this
girl
case
we
got
the
government
registers
searched
for
of
her
village
but
all
such
registers
we
found
had
been
destroyed
none
were
kept
of
births
sixteen
years
back
so
though
she
believed
herself
to
be
and
we
believed
her
to
be
and
the
christians
who
had
known
her
all
her
life
were
sure
she
was
about
sixteen
we
knew
it
could
not
be
proved
she
was
a
very
slight
girl
delicate
and
small
for
her
age
this
was
against
her
and
there
were
other
reasons
against
her
coming
just
then
she
had
to
wait
i
shall
never
forget
the
day
i
had
to
tell
her
so
she
could
not
understand
it
she
knew
that
all
the
higher
castes
had
threatened
to
combine
and
back
up
her
father
in
a
lawsuit
if
she
became
a
christian
but
she
thought
it
would
be
quite
enough
if
she
stood
up
before
the
judge
and
said
she
knew
she
was
of
age
and
she
wanted
to
come
to
us
i
will
not
be
afraid
of
the
people
she
pleaded
i
will
stand
up
straight
before
them
all
and
speak
without
any
fear
i
remember
how
the
tears
filled
her
eyes
as
i
explained
things
it
was
so
hard
for
her
to
understand
that
we
had
no
power
whatever
to
protect
her
it
would
be
worse
for
her
if
she
came
and
had
to
be
given
up
she
was
fully
sensible
of
this
but
would
god
let
them
take
me
away
would
he
not
take
care
of
me
she
asked
i
suppose
it
is
right
to
obey
the
laws
they
are
on
whole
righteous
laws
made
in
the
defence
of
these
very
girls
it
would
never
do
if
anyone
could
decoy
away
a
mere
child
from
her
parents
or
natural
guardians
but
the
unrighteous
thing
as
it
seems
to
us
is
that
the
whole
burden
of
proof
lies
upon
us
and
that
in
these
country
villages
no
facilities
such
as
government
registers
of
birth
are
to
be
had
by
which
we
could
hope
legally
to
prove
a
point
about
which
we
are
morally
sure
we
feel
that
as
the
burden
of
proof
rests
upon
us
surely
facilities
should
be
obtainable
by
which
we
could
find
out
a
girl
age
before
she
comes
so
that
we
might
know
whether
or
not
we
might
legally
protect
her
still
more
strongly
we
feel
it
is
strange
justice
which
decrees
that
though
a
child
of
twelve
may
be
legally
held
competent
to
undertake
the
responsibilities
of
wifehood
six
years
more
must
pass
before
she
may
be
legally
held
free
to
obey
her
conscience
free
she
is
never
legally
free
a
widow
may
be
legally
free
a
wife
in
india
never
hardly
a
single
caste
wife
in
all
this
empire
would
be
found
in
the
little
band
of
open
christians
if
the
missionary
concerned
had
not
risked
more
than
can
be
told
here
and
put
god
law
before
man
but
oh
the
number
who
have
been
turned
back
one
stops
forces
the
words
down
they
come
too
hot
and
fast
there
are
reasons
as
i
write
a
young
wife
dear
to
us
is
lying
bruised
and
unconscious
on
the
floor
of
the
inner
room
of
a
hindu
house
her
husband
encouraged
by
her
own
mother
set
himself
to
make
her
conform
to
a
certain
caste
custom
it
was
idolatrous
she
refused
he
beat
her
then
blow
upon
blow
till
she
fell
senseless
they
brought
her
round
and
began
again
there
is
no
satisfactory
redress
she
is
his
wife
she
is
not
free
to
be
a
christian
he
knows
it
her
relations
know
it
she
knows
it
poor
child
o
god
forgive
us
if
we
are
too
hot
too
sore
at
heart
for
easy
pleasantness
and
god
raise
up
in
india
christian
statesmen
who
will
inquire
into
this
matter
and
refuse
to
be
blindfolded
and
deceived
his
laws
and
ours
clash
somewhere
the
question
is
where
to
return
to
treasure
we
left
her
waiting
to
come
a
christian
teacher
lived
next
door
and
treasure
used
to
slip
in
sometimes
as
the
two
courtyards
adjoined
we
had
put
up
a
text
on
the
wall
for
her
fear
not
for
i
have
redeemed
thee
i
have
called
thee
by
thy
name
thou
art
mine
this
was
her
special
text
and
she
looked
at
it
now
and
then
she
grew
braver
and
promised
to
be
patient
and
try
to
win
her
mother
who
was
bitterly
opposed
but
oh
how
i
remember
the
wistfulness
of
her
face
as
i
went
out
and
one
very
heart
can
feel
again
the
stab
of
pain
like
a
knife
cutting
deep
as
i
left
her
to
her
fate
you
have
seen
a
tree
standing
stark
and
bare
a
bleak
black
thing
on
a
sunny
day
against
a
sky
of
blue
you
have
looked
at
it
fascinated
by
the
silent
horror
of
it
a
distorted
cinder
not
a
tree
and
someone
tells
you
it
was
struck
in
the
last
great
thunderstorm
next
time
we
saw
treasure
she
was
like
that
what
happened
between
so
far
as
it
is
known
was
this
they
tried
to
persuade
her
they
tried
to
coerce
her
she
witnessed
to
jesus
and
never
faltered
though
once
they
dragged
her
out
of
the
house
by
her
hair
and
holding
her
down
against
the
wall
struck
her
hard
with
a
leather
strap
one
of
the
christians
saw
it
and
heard
the
poor
tortured
child
cry
out
i
do
not
fear
i
do
not
fear
it
will
only
send
me
to
jesus
then
they
tried
threats
we
will
take
you
out
to
the
lake
at
night
and
cut
you
in
little
pieces
and
throw
you
into
it
she
fully
believed
them
but
even
so
we
hear
she
did
not
flinch
then
they
did
their
worst
to
her
it
was
a
sunday
morning
the
saturday
evening
before
she
had
managed
to
see
the
teacher
she
told
her
hurriedly
how
one
had
come
a
bridegroom
she
called
him
a
student
from
a
mission
college
he
was
telling
her
all
sorts
of
things
that
christianity
was
an
exploded
religion
and
how
a
great
and
learned
woman
besant
had
exposed
the
missionaries
and
their
ways
so
that
no
thinking
people
had
any
excuse
for
being
deceived
by
them
then
she
added
earnestly
it
is
the
devil
do
pray
for
me
they
want
me
to
marry
him
secretly
oh
i
must
go
to
the
missie
ammal
and
if
we
had
only
known
we
would
have
risked
anything
any
breach
of
the
law
of
the
land
to
save
her
from
a
breach
of
the
law
of
heaven
for
all
this
talk
between
an
indian
girl
of
good
repute
and
her
prospective
husband
is
utterly
foreign
to
what
is
considered
right
in
old
india
it
in
itself
meant
danger
but
we
knew
nothing
and
next
day
all
that
sunday
she
was
shut
up
and
no
one
knows
what
happened
to
her
on
monday
she
was
seen
again
but
changed
so
utterly
changed
we
heard
nothing
of
this
till
the
following
wednesday
the
christians
were
honestly
concerned
but
the
tamil
is
ever
casual
and
they
saw
no
reason
for
distressing
us
with
bad
news
sooner
than
could
be
helped
as
soon
as
we
heard
i
sent
two
of
the
sisters
who
knew
her
best
to
try
and
see
her
if
possible
they
managed
to
see
her
for
two
or
three
minutes
but
found
her
hopelessly
hard
every
bit
of
care
was
gone
she
laughed
in
a
queer
strained
way
they
said
it
was
no
use
my
trying
to
see
her
but
i
determined
to
see
her
i
can
not
go
over
it
all
again
it
is
like
tearing
the
skin
off
a
wound
so
the
letter
written
at
the
time
may
tell
the
rest
of
it
on
saturday
i
went
i
went
straight
to
the
teacher
house
and
sent
off
the
bandy
at
once
and
by
god
special
arrangement
got
in
unnoticed
for
hours
we
sat
in
the
little
inner
room
waiting
we
could
hear
her
voice
in
the
courtyard
outside
a
hard
changed
voice
the
teacher
tried
to
get
her
in
but
no
she
would
not
come
oh
how
we
held
on
to
god
i
could
not
bear
to
go
till
i
had
seen
her
at
last
we
had
to
go
the
cart
came
back
for
us
thus
proclaiming
where
we
were
and
the
last
human
chance
was
gone
and
then
just
then
like
one
walking
in
a
dream
treasure
wandered
in
and
stood
startled
she
did
not
know
we
were
there
we
were
kneeling
with
our
backs
to
the
door
i
turned
and
saw
her
i
can
not
write
about
the
next
five
minutes
i
thought
i
realised
something
of
what
satan
could
do
in
this
land
but
i
knew
nothing
about
it
oh
when
will
jesus
come
and
end
it
all
just
once
it
seemed
as
if
the
spell
were
broken
my
arms
were
round
her
though
she
had
shrunk
away
at
first
and
tried
to
push
me
from
her
she
was
quiet
now
and
seemed
to
understand
a
little
how
one
cared
she
knelt
down
with
me
and
covered
her
eyes
as
if
in
prayer
while
i
poured
out
my
soul
for
her
and
then
we
were
all
very
still
and
the
lord
seemed
very
near
but
she
rose
unmoved
and
looked
at
us
we
were
all
quite
broken
down
and
she
smiled
in
a
strange
hard
foolish
way
that
was
all
the
cause
no
one
knows
there
are
only
two
possible
explanations
one
is
poison
there
is
some
sort
of
medicine
which
it
is
known
is
given
in
such
cases
this
is
the
view
held
by
the
christians
on
the
spot
one
of
them
says
her
cousin
was
dealt
with
in
this
way
he
was
keen
to
be
a
christian
and
was
shut
up
for
a
day
and
came
out
dead
dead
she
means
to
all
which
before
had
been
life
to
him
the
other
and
worse
is
sin
has
she
been
forced
into
some
sin
which
to
one
so
enlightened
as
she
is
must
mean
an
awful
darkness
the
hiding
of
god
face
i
can
not
tell
you
how
bright
this
dear
child
was
up
till
that
saturday
evening
her
faith
never
wavered
she
was
a
living
sign
to
all
the
town
that
the
lord
is
god
the
heathen
are
triumphant
now
i
have
told
you
plainly
what
has
happened
god
truth
needs
no
painting
i
leave
it
with
you
do
you
believe
it
is
perfectly
true
then
what
are
you
going
to
do
chapter
xvi
wanted
volunteers
we
have
a
great
and
imposing
war
office
but
a
very
small
army
while
vast
continents
are
shrouded
in
almost
utter
darkness
and
hundreds
of
millions
suffer
the
horrors
of
heathenism
or
of
islam
the
burden
of
proof
lies
upon
you
to
show
that
the
circumstances
in
which
god
has
placed
you
were
meant
by
him
to
keep
you
out
of
the
foreign
mission
field
keith
falconer
in
one
of
the
addresses
delivered
at
the
international
student
missionary
conference
london
in
january
a
south
indian
missionary
spoke
of
the
brahman
race
as
the
brain
of
india
their
numbers
are
comparatively
small
between
ten
and
fifteen
millions
but
though
numerically
few
only
five
per
cent
of
the
hindu
population
they
hold
all
that
population
in
the
hollow
of
their
hand
they
occupy
every
position
of
influence
in
the
land
they
are
the
statesmen
and
politicians
the
judges
magistrates
government
officials
and
clerks
of
every
grade
if
there
is
any
position
conferring
influence
over
their
it
will
be
held
by
a
brahman
moreover
they
are
a
sacred
caste
admitted
by
the
people
to
be
gods
upon
earth
a
rank
supposed
to
have
been
attained
by
worth
maintained
through
many
transmigrations
illustration
a
typical
brahman
face
it
is
keener
than
the
photo
shows
and
has
the
cynical
expression
so
many
brahman
faces
have
such
a
man
is
hard
to
win
among
the
petras
of
this
district
is
a
little
country
town
held
in
strength
by
the
brahmans
no
convert
has
ever
come
from
that
town
and
the
town
boasts
that
none
ever
shall
none
of
the
houses
are
open
yet
to
teaching
or
even
visiting
but
we
are
making
friends
and
hope
for
an
entrance
soon
we
spent
a
morning
out
in
the
street
they
had
no
objection
to
that
and
as
the
free
young
brahmans
gathered
round
us
or
stood
for
a
moment
against
a
wall
to
be
caught
it
was
difficult
even
for
us
who
knew
it
to
realise
how
bound
they
were
bound
who
should
conquer
slaves
who
should
be
kings
bound
body
and
soul
in
a
bondage
perfectly
incomprehensible
to
the
english
mind
afterwards
when
we
saw
the
photographs
we
recalled
one
and
another
who
while
they
were
young
students
like
these
dared
to
desire
to
escape
from
their
bondage
but
back
they
were
dragged
and
the
chains
were
riveted
faster
than
ever
and
every
link
was
tested
again
and
hammered
down
hard
we
wanted
to
be
sure
of
our
facts
about
each
of
them
that
these
facts
may
further
answer
that
smile
which
assures
us
things
are
not
as
we
imagine
so
the
iyer
wrote
to
a
brother
missionary
who
had
known
these
lads
well
and
asked
him
to
tell
what
happened
to
each
of
them
this
morning
the
answer
to
that
letter
came
and
was
handed
to
me
with
i
hardly
like
to
give
it
to
you
but
it
tells
the
truth
about
what
goes
on
these
boys
were
students
in
our
college
the
first
one
mentioned
in
the
letter
is
a
young
brahman
who
confessed
christ
in
baptism
and
bravely
withstood
the
tremendous
opposition
raised
by
his
friends
who
came
in
crowds
for
many
weeks
and
tried
by
every
argument
to
persuade
him
to
return
to
hinduism
but
he
preached
christ
to
them
they
brought
his
young
wife
and
she
tore
her
hair
and
wailed
and
besought
him
not
to
condemn
her
to
the
shame
of
a
life
this
was
the
hardest
of
all
to
withstand
he
turned
to
the
missionary
and
said
oh
my
father
take
her
away
she
is
tearing
out
my
heart
illustration
a
typical
brahman
student
the
marks
on
the
forehead
are
made
of
bright
red
yellow
and
white
paste
and
represents
the
footprint
of
the
god
vishnu
these
brahmans
are
vaishnavites
then
came
the
baptism
day
of
another
brahman
student
his
friend
who
previous
to
this
had
been
seized
by
his
relatives
shut
up
and
starved
and
then
fed
with
poisoned
food
but
the
poison
was
not
strong
enough
to
kill
and
he
had
escaped
and
was
now
safe
and
ready
for
baptism
it
was
remembered
afterwards
how
the
friend
of
the
newly
baptised
stood
and
rejoiced
and
praised
god
then
the
baptism
over
fearing
no
danger
in
open
day
he
went
to
the
tank
to
bathe
he
was
never
seen
again
what
happened
exactly
no
one
knows
it
is
thought
that
men
hired
to
watch
him
seized
their
opportunity
and
carried
him
off
what
they
did
then
has
never
been
told
contradictory
reports
about
the
boy
have
reached
the
missionaries
one
that
he
is
still
holding
on
another
that
he
is
now
a
priest
in
one
of
the
great
saivite
temples
of
south
india
which
is
true
god
knows
but
we
are
under
the
english
government
could
nothing
be
done
one
of
his
near
relatives
is
the
present
judge
of
the
high
court
of
one
of
our
indian
cities
and
among
the
crowd
of
brahmans
who
came
during
those
weeks
there
were
influential
men
graduates
of
colleges
members
of
the
legal
profession
a
favourite
profession
in
india
and
yet
this
thing
was
done
there
was
another
the
means
used
to
get
hold
of
him
can
not
be
written
here
that
is
the
difficulty
which
fronts
us
when
we
try
to
tell
the
truth
as
it
really
is
it
simply
can
not
be
told
the
dust
may
be
shown
or
a
little
of
it
the
whole
of
the
actual
never
there
were
others
near
the
kingdom
but
it
is
the
same
story
over
again
they
were
all
spirited
away
from
the
college
the
missionary
writes
makes
one
heart
sick
to
think
of
them
and
the
hellish
means
invented
to
turn
them
from
these
are
not
the
words
of
sentimental
imagination
they
are
the
words
of
a
man
who
gives
evidence
as
a
witness
but
even
a
witness
may
he
tells
us
of
one
a
bright
happy
fellow
he
says
he
was
whose
friends
made
no
objection
to
his
returning
home
after
his
baptism
and
he
returned
thinking
he
would
be
able
to
live
as
a
christian
with
his
wife
they
drugged
his
food
then
what
they
did
has
to
be
covered
with
silence
again
they
did
their
worst
when
he
awoke
from
that
nightmare
of
sin
he
sought
out
his
missionary
friend
some
of
the
hindus
even
ashamed
of
the
vile
means
used
to
entice
him
and
destroy
him
would
have
wished
him
to
be
received
again
as
a
christian
but
his
spirit
was
broken
he
said
he
could
not
disgrace
the
cause
of
christ
by
coming
back
he
would
go
away
where
he
would
not
be
known
he
left
his
wife
and
went
he
has
never
been
heard
of
since
our
comrade
tells
of
another
and
again
in
telling
it
we
have
to
leave
it
half
untold
this
one
was
eager
to
confess
christ
in
baptism
he
was
a
student
at
college
then
and
very
keen
his
father
knew
of
his
desire
and
he
did
what
few
hindu
fathers
would
do
turned
his
home
into
a
hell
in
order
to
ruin
his
the
infernal
plot
succeeded
god
only
knows
how
far
the
soul
is
responsible
when
the
mind
is
dazed
and
then
inflamed
by
those
fearful
drugs
but
we
do
know
that
the
soul
he
meant
should
rise
and
shine
sinks
weighted
down
by
the
unspeakable
shame
of
some
awful
memory
darkened
as
by
some
dark
dye
that
has
stained
it
through
and
through
i
think
of
others
as
i
write
one
was
a
boy
we
knew
well
a
splendid
earnest
lad
keen
to
witness
for
christ
he
told
us
one
evening
how
he
had
been
delivered
from
those
who
were
plotting
his
destruction
for
several
months
after
his
decision
to
be
a
christian
he
lived
at
home
and
tried
to
win
his
people
but
they
were
incensed
against
him
for
even
thinking
of
breaking
caste
and
would
not
listen
to
him
still
he
waited
and
witnessed
to
them
not
fearing
anything
then
one
day
suddenly
some
men
rushed
into
the
room
where
he
was
sitting
seized
and
bound
and
gagged
him
they
forced
something
into
his
mouth
as
he
lay
on
the
floor
at
their
mercy
he
feared
it
was
a
drug
but
it
was
only
some
disgusting
stuff
which
to
a
hindu
meant
unutterable
defilement
then
they
left
him
bound
alone
and
at
night
he
managed
to
escape
a
few
months
after
he
told
us
this
we
heard
he
had
been
seized
again
and
this
time
drugged
and
done
for
in
south
india
baptism
does
not
prevent
the
caste
from
using
every
possible
means
to
get
the
convert
back
once
back
certain
ceremonies
are
performed
after
which
he
is
regarded
as
purified
and
reinstated
in
his
caste
the
policy
of
the
whole
caste
confederation
is
this
get
him
back
unbaptised
if
you
can
but
anyhow
him
two
brahman
lads
belonging
to
different
parts
of
this
district
decided
for
christ
went
through
all
that
is
involved
in
open
confession
and
were
baptised
one
of
the
two
was
sent
north
for
safety
his
people
traced
him
followed
him
turned
up
unexpectedly
at
a
wayside
station
in
central
india
and
forced
him
back
to
his
home
in
the
south
once
there
they
took
their
own
measures
to
keep
him
the
other
lad
was
sent
to
madras
the
brahmans
found
out
where
he
was
broke
into
the
house
at
night
overpowered
the
boy
protectors
and
carried
him
off
they
too
did
what
seemed
good
to
them
there
and
they
too
succeeded
no
one
outside
could
interfere
the
caste
guards
its
own
concerns
o
lord
jesus
christ
wrote
one
a
hindu
still
who
knowest
us
to
be
placed
in
such
danger
that
it
is
as
if
we
were
within
some
magical
circle
drawn
round
us
and
satan
standing
with
his
wand
without
keeping
us
in
terror
break
the
spell
of
satan
and
set
us
free
to
serve
thee
all
this
may
be
easy
reading
to
those
who
are
far
away
from
the
place
where
it
happened
distance
has
a
way
of
softening
too
distinct
an
outline
but
it
is
not
easy
to
write
it
comes
so
close
to
us
why
write
it
then
we
write
it
because
it
seems
to
us
it
should
be
more
fully
known
so
that
men
and
women
who
know
our
god
and
the
secret
of
how
to
lay
hold
upon
him
should
lay
hold
and
hold
on
for
the
winning
of
the
castes
for
christ
illustration
another
brahman
much
duller
than
the
last
this
and
the
two
preceding
photographs
are
perfect
as
a
study
of
three
types
of
brahmanhood
as
we
have
it
in
southern
india
keen
thoughtful
dull
surely
the
very
hardness
of
an
enterprise
the
very
fact
that
it
is
what
a
soldier
would
call
a
forlorn
hope
is
in
itself
a
call
and
a
claim
stronger
than
any
put
forth
by
something
easier
the
soldier
does
not
give
in
because
the
hope
is
forlorn
it
is
a
be
it
ever
so
desperate
he
volunteers
for
it
and
win
or
not
he
fights
there
is
that
in
this
enterprise
which
may
mark
it
out
as
forlorn
for
ages
the
race
has
broken
one
of
nature
laws
with
blind
persistency
and
the
result
is
a
certain
lack
of
moral
fibre
grit
tone
no
separate
individual
is
responsible
for
this
harsh
judgments
are
entirely
out
of
place
but
the
fact
remains
that
it
is
so
and
it
must
be
taken
into
account
in
dealing
with
the
brahmans
and
several
of
the
upper
castes
of
india
side
by
side
with
this
element
of
weakness
there
is
in
apparent
contradiction
that
stubborn
element
of
strength
known
as
the
caste
spirit
this
spirit
is
seen
in
all
i
have
shown
you
of
what
happens
when
a
convert
comes
it
is
as
if
all
the
million
wills
of
the
million
caste
men
and
women
were
condensed
into
one
single
will
a
concentration
of
essence
of
will
not
comparable
with
anything
known
at
home
look
at
this
face
it
is
a
photographed
fact
does
it
not
show
you
an
absence
of
that
something
which
nerves
to
endurance
stimulates
to
dare
then
listen
to
this
a
christian
man
lies
dead
the
way
to
the
cemetery
lies
through
the
brahman
street
in
the
chief
town
of
this
district
there
is
no
other
way
the
brahman
street
is
a
thoroughfare
it
can
not
be
closed
to
traffic
but
the
brahmans
refuse
point
blank
to
allow
that
dead
man
to
be
carried
through
the
bishop
expostulates
no
he
was
a
christian
he
shall
not
be
carried
through
time
is
passing
in
the
tropics
the
dead
must
be
buried
quickly
the
bishop
appeals
to
the
collector
representative
of
government
here
the
collector
gives
an
order
the
brahmans
refuse
to
obey
he
orders
out
a
company
of
soldiers
the
brahmans
mass
on
the
housetops
and
stone
the
soldiers
the
order
is
given
to
fire
then
and
not
till
then
the
christians
may
carry
out
their
dead
and
later
on
the
brahmans
carry
out
theirs
this
happened
some
years
ago
and
outwardly
times
have
changed
since
then
in
that
particular
town
but
the
spirit
that
it
shows
is
in
possession
to
this
day
and
as
small
things
show
great
so
this
street
scene
shows
the
presence
of
that
something
which
intensifies
the
difficulty
of
winning
the
castes
for
christ
each
unit
is
weak
in
itself
but
in
combination
strong
a
forlorn
hope
we
have
called
the
attempt
to
do
what
we
are
told
to
do
the
word
is
a
misnomer
with
our
captain
as
our
leader
no
hope
is
ever
forlorn
but
our
leader
calls
for
men
men
like
the
brave
of
old
who
jeopardised
their
lives
unto
the
death
in
the
high
places
of
the
field
in
the
day
that
they
came
to
the
help
of
the
lord
to
the
help
of
the
lord
against
the
mighty
a
jeopardised
life
may
be
lost
christ
our
captain
is
calling
for
volunteers
here
are
the
terms
whosoever
shall
lose
his
life
for
my
sake
and
the
gospel
the
same
shall
find
it
the
teachers
life
may
seem
lost
who
lives
for
his
college
boys
the
student
life
may
seem
lost
who
spends
hour
after
hour
through
the
long
hot
days
in
quiet
talks
in
the
house
be
it
so
for
it
may
mean
that
but
the
life
lost
for
his
name
sake
the
same
shall
be
found
again
chapter
xvii
if
it
is
so
very
important
let
us
for
a
moment
imagine
what
would
have
happened
on
the
galilean
hillside
when
our
lord
fed
the
five
thousand
if
the
apostles
had
acted
as
some
act
now
the
twelve
would
be
going
backwards
helping
the
first
rank
over
and
over
again
and
leaving
the
back
rows
unsupplied
let
us
suppose
one
of
them
say
andrew
venturing
to
say
to
his
brother
simon
peter
we
all
to
be
feeding
the
front
row
ought
we
not
to
divide
and
some
of
us
go
to
the
back
rows
then
suppose
peter
replying
no
do
you
see
these
front
people
are
so
hungry
they
have
not
had
half
enough
yet
besides
they
are
nearest
to
us
so
we
are
more
responsible
for
them
then
if
andrew
resumes
his
appeal
suppose
peter
going
on
to
say
well
you
are
quite
right
you
go
and
feed
all
those
back
rows
but
i
ca
spare
anyone
else
i
and
the
other
ten
of
us
have
more
than
we
can
do
here
once
more
suppose
andrew
persuades
philip
to
go
with
him
then
perhaps
matthew
will
cry
out
and
say
they
all
going
to
those
farther
rows
is
no
one
to
be
left
to
these
needy
people
in
front
let
me
ask
the
members
of
congress
do
you
recognise
these
sentences
at
all
stock
at
shrewsbury
church
it
was
only
a
common
thing
a
girl
very
ill
and
in
terrible
pain
who
turned
to
us
for
help
we
could
do
nothing
for
her
her
people
resorted
to
heathen
rites
they
prepared
her
to
meet
the
fierce
god
they
thought
was
waiting
to
snatch
her
away
we
went
again
and
again
but
she
suffered
so
that
one
could
not
say
much
it
did
not
seem
any
use
the
last
time
we
went
the
crisis
had
passed
she
would
live
they
told
us
with
joy
they
were
eager
to
listen
to
us
now
tell
us
all
about
your
way
clamoured
the
women
speaking
together
and
very
loud
tell
us
the
news
from
beginning
to
end
but
alas
they
could
take
in
very
little
one
whole
new
truth
was
too
much
for
them
never
mind
they
consoled
us
come
every
day
and
then
what
you
say
will
take
hold
of
our
hearts
and
i
had
to
tell
them
we
were
leaving
that
evening
and
could
not
come
every
day
illustration
is
not
the
contrast
good
the
old
woman
so
intelligent
the
baby
so
inane
she
made
a
picture
sitting
there
in
her
crimson
edged
seeley
with
her
dark
old
face
showing
up
against
the
darker
wall
she
is
one
of
the
many
we
have
missed
by
coming
so
slowly
and
so
late
how
can
i
change
now
she
says
the
girl
turned
her
patient
face
towards
us
she
had
smiled
at
the
name
of
jesus
and
it
seemed
as
if
down
in
the
depths
of
her
weakness
she
had
listened
when
we
spoke
before
and
tried
to
understand
now
she
looked
puzzled
and
troubled
and
the
women
all
asked
why
there
in
that
crowded
hot
little
room
a
sense
of
the
unequal
distribution
of
the
bread
of
life
came
over
us
the
front
rows
of
the
five
thousand
are
getting
the
loaves
and
the
fishes
over
and
over
again
till
it
seems
as
though
they
have
to
be
bribed
and
besought
to
accept
them
while
the
back
rows
are
almost
forgotten
it
that
we
are
so
busy
with
the
front
rows
which
we
can
see
that
we
have
no
time
for
the
back
rows
out
of
sight
but
is
it
fair
is
it
what
jesus
our
master
intended
it
be
really
called
fair
the
women
looked
very
reproachful
then
one
of
them
said
looking
up
at
me
you
say
this
is
very
important
if
it
is
so
very
important
why
did
you
not
come
before
you
say
you
will
come
back
again
if
you
can
but
how
can
we
be
sure
that
nothing
will
happen
to
stop
you
we
are
some
of
us
very
old
we
may
die
before
you
come
back
this
going
away
is
not
good
and
again
and
again
she
repeated
it
is
so
very
important
why
did
you
not
come
before
do
think
that
the
question
meant
more
than
it
did
it
was
only
a
human
expression
of
wonder
it
was
not
a
real
desire
after
god
but
the
force
of
the
question
was
stronger
far
than
the
poor
old
questioner
knew
it
appealed
to
our
very
hearts
the
people
saw
we
were
greatly
moved
and
they
pressed
closer
round
us
to
comfort
us
and
one
dear
old
grandmother
put
her
arms
round
me
and
stroked
my
face
with
her
wrinkled
old
hand
and
said
do
be
troubled
we
will
worship
your
god
we
will
worship
him
just
as
we
worship
our
own
will
you
go
away
glad
the
dear
old
woman
was
really
in
earnest
she
wanted
so
much
to
comfort
us
but
her
voice
seemed
to
mingle
with
voices
from
the
homeland
and
another
we
heard
another
the
voice
i
had
heard
on
the
the
voice
of
our
brothers
our
sisters
blood
calling
unto
god
from
the
ground
friends
are
these
women
real
to
you
look
at
this
photo
of
one
of
them
surely
it
was
not
just
a
happy
chance
which
brought
out
the
detail
so
perfectly
look
at
the
thoughtful
fine
old
face
can
you
look
at
it
and
say
yes
i
am
on
my
way
to
the
light
and
you
are
on
your
way
to
the
dark
at
least
this
is
what
i
profess
to
believe
and
i
am
sorry
for
you
but
this
is
all
i
can
do
for
you
i
can
be
very
sorry
for
you
i
know
that
this
will
not
show
you
the
way
from
the
dark
where
you
are
to
the
light
where
i
am
to
show
you
the
way
i
must
go
to
you
or
perhaps
send
you
one
whom
i
want
for
myself
or
do
without
something
i
wish
to
have
and
this
of
course
is
impossible
it
might
be
done
if
i
loved
god
enough
i
love
myself
better
than
god
or
illustration
a
brahman
widow
the
only
brahman
woman
who
would
let
us
take
her
photo
brahman
women
wear
their
seeleys
fastened
in
a
peculiar
way
and
never
cut
their
ears
brahman
widows
are
always
shaven
and
wear
no
jewels
this
one
is
a
muscular
character
strong
and
resolute
an
ordinary
looking
woman
but
there
must
be
an
life
which
does
not
show
a
widow
fate
is
described
in
one
word
here
you
would
not
say
such
a
thing
i
know
but
whoso
hath
this
good
and
seeth
his
brother
have
need
and
shutteth
up
his
compassion
from
him
how
dwelleth
the
love
of
god
in
him
chapter
xviii
the
call
intensified
sometimes
the
men
and
boys
will
not
go
away
and
let
us
talk
to
the
women
in
such
cases
i
find
silent
prayer
the
best
refuge
in
other
places
the
people
welcome
you
but
will
listen
to
anything
but
the
doctrine
of
jesus
christ
and
this
is
harder
to
bear
than
anything
else
i
know
gordon
let
the
people
that
are
at
home
not
care
only
to
hear
about
successes
we
must
train
them
that
they
take
an
interest
in
the
struggle
schreiber
sumatra
and
it
is
a
fight
making
its
demands
upon
physical
mental
and
spiritual
powers
and
there
are
many
adversaries
the
dead
weight
of
heathenism
the
little
appreciation
of
one
object
and
purpose
and
the
actual
vigorous
opposition
of
the
powers
of
darkness
make
it
a
real
fight
and
only
men
of
grit
of
courage
devotion
and
infinite
patience
and
perseverance
will
win
i
painted
a
discouraging
picture
am
i
frightening
good
men
who
might
have
volunteered
and
done
well
i
think
not
i
think
the
right
sort
of
men
those
who
ought
to
volunteer
will
be
attracted
rather
than
repelled
by
the
lampard
we
got
this
photograph
that
day
in
december
which
we
spent
in
the
friendly
brahman
street
there
is
not
another
woman
in
the
town
who
would
stand
for
you
like
that
said
the
men
as
she
came
forward
and
without
a
thought
of
posing
stood
against
the
wall
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
the
camera
straight
most
of
the
women
were
afraid
even
to
glance
at
it
but
she
was
not
afraid
she
would
not
stay
to
talk
to
us
however
but
marched
off
with
the
same
resolute
air
for
brahman
widows
as
a
whole
are
by
no
means
an
approachable
race
sometimes
we
find
one
who
will
open
out
to
us
and
let
us
tell
her
of
the
comfort
wherewith
we
are
comforted
but
oftener
we
find
them
hard
or
hardening
rapidly
illustration
there
is
nothing
to
say
about
it
except
what
is
said
in
the
chapter
there
is
nothing
much
to
look
at
in
a
brahman
street
but
that
single
simple
street
scene
represents
forces
which
control
two
hundred
and
seven
million
minds
it
is
too
soon
to
write
about
any
of
those
who
have
listened
during
the
past
few
months
but
we
put
this
photo
in
to
remind
you
to
remember
those
who
are
freer
than
most
women
in
india
to
follow
the
lord
jesus
christ
if
only
they
would
let
his
love
have
a
chance
of
drawing
them
we
have
been
to
the
various
towns
in
this
and
the
upper
curve
of
the
mountains
but
we
have
not
reached
the
lower
curve
towns
or
half
of
the
many
villages
scattered
close
under
the
mountains
and
except
when
we
went
out
in
camp
we
have
not
of
course
touched
those
farther
afield
there
are
only
five
working
afternoons
in
a
week
for
saturday
is
given
up
to
other
things
and
sunday
belongs
to
the
christians
and
when
any
interest
is
shown
we
return
again
to
the
same
village
which
delays
us
but
is
certainly
worth
while
then
there
are
interruptions
sometimes
on
the
hindu
side
festivals
for
instance
when
no
woman
has
time
to
hear
and
on
ours
and
on
the
weather
so
to
speak
when
great
heat
or
great
rain
make
outdoor
work
impossible
theoretically
itinerating
is
delightfully
rapid
but
practically
as
every
itinerating
missionary
knows
it
is
quite
slow
there
are
other
things
to
be
done
those
already
brought
in
have
to
be
taught
and
trained
and
mothered
and
much
time
has
to
be
spent
in
waiting
upon
god
for
more
so
that
looking
back
we
seem
to
have
done
very
little
for
the
thousands
about
us
and
now
we
must
return
to
the
eastern
side
of
the
district
for
some
of
the
boy
converts
are
there
at
school
and
there
may
be
fruit
to
gather
in
after
last
year
sowing
but
i
look
up
from
my
writing
and
see
a
stretch
of
mountain
range
thirty
miles
long
and
this
range
stretches
unbroken
for
a
thousand
miles
to
the
north
i
know
how
little
is
being
done
on
the
plains
below
and
i
wonder
when
god
people
will
awake
and
understand
that
there
is
yet
very
much
land
to
be
possessed
and
arise
and
possess
it
look
down
this
mountain
strip
with
me
there
are
towns
where
work
is
being
done
but
it
needs
supervision
and
the
missionaries
are
too
few
to
do
it
thoroughly
there
are
towns
and
numbers
of
villages
where
nothing
is
even
attempted
except
that
once
in
two
years
if
possible
the
men
itinerant
band
comes
round
but
that
does
not
reach
the
women
well
and
even
if
it
did
how
much
would
you
know
of
jesus
if
you
only
heard
a
parable
or
a
miracle
or
a
few
facts
from
his
life
or
a
few
points
of
his
doctrine
in
two
i
do
not
want
to
write
touching
appeals
or
to
draw
one
worker
from
anywhere
else
it
would
be
a
joy
to
know
that
god
used
these
letters
to
help
to
send
someone
to
china
or
anywhere
where
he
has
need
of
his
workers
but
i
can
not
help
wondering
as
i
look
round
this
bit
of
the
field
how
it
is
that
the
workers
are
still
so
few
we
have
found
the
people
in
the
towns
and
villages
willing
to
let
us
do
what
we
call
verandah
work
when
they
will
not
let
us
into
their
houses
verandah
work
like
preaching
is
unsatisfactory
as
regards
the
women
but
it
is
better
than
nothing
we
spent
an
afternoon
in
the
street
this
photo
shows
it
is
a
thoroughfare
and
so
we
were
not
forbidden
but
even
so
we
always
ask
permission
before
we
walk
down
it
such
an
ordinary
commonplace
street
it
looks
to
you
there
is
no
architectural
grandeur
to
awe
the
beholder
and
impress
him
with
the
majesty
of
brahmanhood
and
yet
that
street
and
every
street
like
it
is
a
very
petra
to
us
for
it
is
walled
round
by
walls
higher
and
stronger
than
the
temple
walls
round
which
it
is
built
walls
built
as
it
seems
of
some
crystal
rock
imperceptible
till
you
come
up
to
it
and
even
then
not
visible
only
recognisable
as
something
you
can
not
get
through
our
first
day
there
was
encouraging
we
began
at
the
far
end
of
the
street
and
after
some
persuasion
the
men
agreed
to
move
to
one
side
and
let
us
have
the
other
for
any
women
who
would
come
nothing
particular
happened
but
we
count
a
day
good
if
we
get
a
single
good
chance
to
speak
in
quietness
to
the
women
next
time
we
went
it
was
not
so
good
they
had
heard
in
the
meantime
all
about
us
and
that
we
had
girls
from
the
higher
castes
with
us
and
this
was
terrible
in
their
eyes
for
the
brahman
from
his
lofty
position
of
absolute
supremacy
holds
in
very
small
account
the
souls
of
those
he
calls
but
if
any
from
the
middle
distance
he
would
not
describe
them
as
near
himself
only
dangerously
nearer
than
the
others
fall
into
the
pit
of
the
christian
religion
he
thinks
it
is
time
to
begin
to
take
care
that
the
power
which
took
such
effect
on
them
should
not
have
a
chance
to
perform
upon
him
and
above
all
upon
his
womankind
so
that
day
we
were
politely
informed
that
no
one
had
time
to
listen
and
when
some
women
wanted
to
come
a
muscular
widow
chased
them
off
we
looked
longingly
back
at
those
dear
brahman
women
but
appeal
was
useless
so
we
went
in
one
of
the
other
castes
the
caste
represented
by
this
row
of
men
we
found
more
friendliness
they
let
us
sit
on
one
end
of
the
narrow
verandah
fronts
and
quite
a
number
of
women
clustered
about
on
the
other
they
were
greatly
afraid
of
defilement
there
and
would
not
come
too
close
and
they
had
the
strangest
ideas
about
us
they
were
sure
we
had
a
powder
which
if
they
inhaled
it
would
compel
them
to
be
christians
they
had
heard
that
we
went
round
calling
children
that
is
beckoning
them
and
drawing
them
to
follow
after
us
and
that
we
were
paid
so
much
a
head
for
converts
it
takes
a
whole
afternoon
sometimes
simply
to
disabuse
their
minds
of
such
misconceptions
i
heard
this
commercial
aspect
of
things
explained
by
one
who
apparently
knew
a
kindly
old
brahman
woman
had
allowed
us
to
sit
on
her
doorstep
out
of
the
sun
and
bit
by
bit
we
had
worked
our
way
to
the
end
of
the
verandah
which
was
a
little
more
shaded
where
a
girl
was
sitting
alone
who
seemed
to
want
to
hear
the
old
woman
sat
down
behind
us
and
then
an
old
man
came
up
and
the
two
began
to
talk
said
the
old
woman
to
the
old
man
she
is
trying
to
make
us
join
her
way
i
had
carefully
abstained
from
any
such
expression
the
old
man
agreed
that
such
was
my
probable
object
what
will
she
get
if
we
join
do
you
know
oh
yes
do
i
not
know
for
one
of
us
a
thousand
rupees
and
for
a
vellalar
five
hundred
she
even
gets
something
for
a
child
but
she
gets
a
whole
thousand
for
one
of
us
illustration
a
house
of
the
better
sort
we
would
give
a
great
deal
to
get
into
this
house
but
so
far
it
is
closed
you
can
see
straight
through
to
the
back
courtyard
where
the
women
are
where
we
may
not
go
the
old
man
is
typical
of
his
class
a
thoughtful
man
of
refinement
of
mind
but
wholly
indifferent
to
the
teaching
they
were
both
very
interested
in
this
conversation
and
so
indeed
was
i
and
i
thought
i
would
further
enlighten
them
when
the
old
woman
got
up
in
a
hurry
and
hobbled
into
the
house
after
that
whenever
we
passed
she
used
to
shake
her
head
at
us
and
say
chee
chee
no
persuasions
could
ever
induce
her
to
let
us
sit
on
her
doorstep
again
we
were
clearly
after
that
thousand
rupees
and
she
would
have
none
of
us
in
the
same
village
there
was
a
little
brahman
child
who
often
tried
to
speak
to
us
but
never
was
allowed
one
day
she
risked
capture
and
its
consequences
and
ran
across
the
narrow
stream
which
divides
the
brahman
street
from
the
village
and
spoke
to
one
of
our
band
in
a
hurried
little
whisper
oh
i
do
want
to
hear
about
jesus
and
she
told
how
she
had
learnt
at
school
in
her
own
town
and
then
she
had
been
sent
to
her
house
in
this
jungle
village
that
one
pointing
to
a
house
where
they
never
had
smiles
for
us
but
her
objected
to
the
preaching
and
had
threatened
to
throw
her
down
the
well
if
she
listened
to
us
just
then
a
hard
voice
called
her
and
she
flew
next
time
we
went
to
that
village
she
was
shut
up
somewhere
inside
often
as
one
passes
one
sees
shy
faces
looking
out
from
behind
the
little
pillars
which
support
the
verandahs
and
one
longs
to
get
nearer
but
it
does
not
do
to
make
any
advance
unless
one
is
sure
of
one
ground
it
only
results
in
a
sudden
startled
scurrying
into
the
house
and
you
can
not
follow
them
there
to
try
to
do
so
would
be
more
than
rude
it
would
be
considered
pollution
only
yesterday
we
were
trying
to
get
to
the
women
who
live
in
the
great
house
of
the
village
behind
the
bungalow
this
photo
shows
you
the
door
we
stood
facing
for
ten
minutes
or
more
first
waiting
and
then
pleading
with
the
old
to
let
us
in
to
the
little
dark
room
in
which
you
may
see
a
woman
form
hiding
behind
the
door
but
we
could
not
go
to
them
and
they
could
not
come
to
us
there
were
only
two
narrow
rooms
between
but
the
second
of
the
two
had
brass
in
it
if
we
had
gone
in
those
vessels
and
the
water
in
them
would
have
been
defiled
the
women
were
not
allowed
to
come
out
the
saw
well
to
that
never
was
one
more
vigilant
she
stood
like
a
great
fat
hen
at
the
door
with
her
white
widow
skirts
outspread
like
wings
and
guarded
her
chickens
effectually
go
go
by
the
way
you
have
come
was
all
she
had
to
say
to
us
the
friendly
old
man
of
the
house
was
out
a
friendly
young
man
came
in
with
some
rice
and
began
to
measure
it
he
invited
us
to
sit
down
which
we
did
and
he
measured
the
rice
in
little
iron
tumblers
counting
aloud
as
he
did
so
in
a
chant
he
was
pleased
that
we
should
watch
him
and
it
was
interesting
to
watch
for
he
did
it
exactly
as
the
verse
describes
pressing
the
rice
down
shaking
the
iron
measure
heaping
up
the
rice
till
it
was
running
over
and
yet
counting
this
abundant
tumblerful
only
as
one
then
he
handed
the
basketful
of
rice
to
a
child
who
stood
waiting
and
asked
what
he
could
do
for
us
we
told
him
how
much
we
wanted
to
see
the
women
of
the
house
but
he
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
tackling
the
vigorous
old
so
we
gave
up
the
attempt
and
went
out
as
we
passed
the
wall
at
the
back
which
encloses
the
women
quarters
we
saw
a
girl
look
over
the
wall
as
if
she
wanted
to
speak
to
us
but
she
was
instantly
pulled
back
by
that
tyrannical
dame
and
a
dog
came
jumping
over
barking
most
furiously
which
set
a
dozen
more
yelping
all
about
us
and
so
escorted
we
retired
this
house
is
in
the
village
of
the
merchant
not
five
minutes
from
our
gate
but
the
women
in
it
are
far
enough
from
any
chance
of
hearing
the
men
let
us
in
that
day
to
take
the
photograph
and
we
hoped
thereby
to
make
friends
but
though
there
are
six
families
living
there
for
the
house
is
large
the
photograph
only
shows
one
end
of
the
verandah
which
runs
down
its
whole
length
we
have
never
been
once
allowed
to
speak
to
one
of
the
women
the
of
all
the
six
takes
care
we
never
get
the
chance
one
of
the
children
a
dear
little
girl
follows
us
outside
sometimes
but
she
is
only
seven
and
not
very
courageous
so
though
she
evidently
picks
up
some
of
the
choruses
we
sing
she
is
afraid
of
being
seen
listening
and
never
gets
much
at
a
time
these
are
some
of
the
practical
difficulties
in
the
way
of
reaching
the
women
there
are
others
suppose
you
do
get
in
or
what
is
more
probable
in
pioneer
work
suppose
you
get
a
verandah
even
then
it
is
not
plain
sailing
by
any
means
for
first
of
all
it
is
dangerously
hot
the
sun
beats
down
on
the
street
or
courtyard
to
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
stone
ledge
you
are
sitting
upon
and
strikes
up
reflected
glare
means
fever
so
you
try
to
edge
a
little
farther
out
of
it
without
disturbing
anyone
feelings
explaining
minutely
why
you
are
doing
it
lest
they
should
think
your
design
is
to
covertly
touch
them
and
then
their
confidence
won
so
far
you
begin
perhaps
with
the
wordless
book
or
a
lyric
set
to
an
indian
tune
or
a
picture
of
some
parable
never
of
our
lord
or
oftener
still
we
find
the
best
way
is
to
open
our
bibles
for
they
all
respect
a
sacred
book
and
read
something
from
it
which
we
know
they
will
understand
we
generally
find
one
or
two
women
about
the
verandahs
and
two
or
three
more
come
within
a
few
minutes
and
seeing
this
two
or
three
more
but
getting
them
and
keeping
them
are
two
different
things
it
is
not
easy
to
hold
people
to
hear
what
they
have
no
special
desire
to
hear
but
we
are
helped
we
are
not
alone
it
is
always
a
strength
to
remember
that
once
fairly
launched
interruptions
begin
you
are
in
the
middle
of
a
miracle
perhaps
and
by
this
time
a
dozen
women
have
gathered
and
rejoice
your
heart
by
listening
well
when
a
man
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
saunters
over
and
asks
may
he
put
a
question
or
asks
it
forthwith
he
has
heard
that
our
book
says
that
if
you
have
faith
you
can
lift
a
mountain
into
the
sea
now
there
is
a
mountain
and
he
points
to
the
pillar
out
on
the
plain
standing
straight
up
for
five
thousand
feet
a
column
of
solid
rock
there
is
sea
on
the
other
side
he
says
cast
it
in
and
we
will
believe
and
the
women
laugh
but
one
more
intelligent
turns
to
you
does
your
book
really
say
that
she
asks
then
why
ca
you
do
it
and
let
us
see
and
the
man
strikes
in
with
another
remark
and
a
woman
at
the
edge
moves
off
and
you
wish
the
man
would
go
perhaps
he
does
or
perhaps
you
are
able
to
detach
him
from
the
visible
and
get
him
and
those
women
too
to
listen
to
some
bit
of
witnessing
to
the
power
that
moves
the
invisible
and
you
are
in
its
very
heart
when
another
objection
is
started
you
say
there
is
only
one
true
god
but
we
have
heard
that
you
worship
three
or
can
your
god
keep
you
from
sin
and
you
try
god
helping
you
to
answer
so
as
to
avoid
discussion
and
perhaps
to
your
joy
succeed
and
some
are
listening
intently
again
when
a
woman
interrupts
with
a
question
about
your
relations
which
you
answered
before
but
she
came
late
and
wants
to
hear
it
all
over
again
you
satisfy
her
as
far
as
you
can
and
then
feeling
how
fast
the
precious
minutes
are
passing
you
try
oh
so
earnestly
to
buy
them
up
and
fill
them
with
eternity
work
when
suddenly
the
whole
community
concentrates
itself
upon
your
tamil
sister
who
is
she
you
had
waived
the
question
at
the
outset
knowing
what
would
sequel
it
but
they
renew
the
charge
if
she
is
a
born
christian
they
exclaim
and
draw
away
for
fear
of
defilement
and
the
word
runs
round
contemptuously
if
she
is
a
convert
they
ask
questions
about
her
relations
they
have
probably
been
guessing
among
themselves
about
her
caste
for
the
last
ten
minutes
if
she
does
not
answer
them
they
let
their
imagination
run
riot
if
she
does
they
break
out
in
indignation
left
your
own
mother
broken
your
caste
and
they
call
her
by
names
not
sweet
to
the
ear
and
perhaps
rise
up
in
a
body
and
refuse
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
such
a
disgraceful
person
or
perhaps
you
are
trying
to
persuade
some
of
them
to
learn
to
read
knowing
that
if
you
can
succeed
there
will
be
so
much
more
chance
of
teaching
them
but
they
assure
you
it
is
not
the
custom
for
women
in
that
village
to
read
which
unhappily
is
true
or
it
may
be
you
are
telling
them
as
you
tell
those
you
may
never
see
again
of
the
love
that
is
loving
them
and
in
the
middle
of
the
telling
a
baby
howls
and
all
the
attention
goes
off
upon
it
or
somebody
wants
to
go
into
the
house
and
a
way
has
to
be
made
for
her
with
much
gathering
together
and
confusion
or
a
dog
comes
yelping
round
the
corner
with
a
stone
at
its
heels
and
a
pack
of
small
boys
in
full
chase
after
it
or
the
men
call
out
it
is
time
to
be
going
or
the
women
suggest
it
is
time
to
be
cooking
or
someone
says
or
does
something
upsetting
and
the
group
breaks
up
in
a
moment
and
each
unit
makes
for
its
separate
hole
and
stands
in
it
looking
out
and
you
look
up
at
those
dark
little
doorways
and
feel
you
would
give
anything
they
could
ask
if
only
they
would
let
you
in
and
let
you
sit
down
beside
them
in
one
of
those
rooms
and
tell
them
the
end
of
the
story
they
interrupted
but
they
will
not
do
that
oh
it
makes
one
sorrowful
to
be
so
near
to
anyone
and
yet
so
very
far
as
one
sometimes
is
from
these
women
you
look
at
them
as
they
stand
in
their
doorways
within
reach
but
out
of
reach
as
out
of
reach
as
if
they
were
thousands
of
miles
away
just
as
i
wrote
those
words
a
brahman
woman
came
to
the
door
and
looked
in
then
she
walked
in
and
sat
down
but
did
not
speak
can
you
think
how
one
heart
bounds
even
at
such
a
little
thing
as
that
brahman
women
do
not
come
to
see
us
every
day
she
pulled
out
a
book
of
slips
and
we
read
it
it
told
how
she
was
one
of
a
family
of
seven
all
born
deaf
and
dumb
how
hand
in
hand
they
had
set
off
to
walk
to
benares
to
drown
themselves
in
the
ganges
how
a
sepoy
had
stopped
them
and
taken
them
to
an
english
collector
how
he
had
provided
for
the
seven
for
a
year
then
let
them
go
how
they
had
scattered
and
wandered
about
visiting
various
holy
places
supported
by
the
virtuous
wherever
they
went
and
how
the
bearer
would
be
glad
to
receive
whatever
we
would
give
her
she
has
gone
a
poor
deaf
and
dumb
and
wholly
heathen
woman
we
could
not
persuade
her
to
stay
and
rest
she
is
married
she
told
us
by
signs
her
husband
is
deaf
and
dumb
and
she
has
one
blind
child
she
sat
on
the
floor
beside
us
for
a
few
minutes
and
asked
questions
the
usual
ones
about
me
all
by
signs
but
nothing
we
could
sign
could
in
any
way
make
her
understand
anything
about
our
god
and
yet
she
seems
to
know
something
at
least
about
her
own
she
pointed
to
her
mouth
and
then
up
and
then
down
and
round
to
show
the
winding
of
a
river
and
signed
clearly
enough
how
she
went
from
holy
river
to
holy
river
and
worshipped
by
each
and
she
pointed
up
and
clasped
her
hands
there
we
were
just
as
i
had
been
writing
so
near
to
her
yet
so
far
from
her
but
the
greatest
difficulty
of
all
in
reaching
the
women
is
that
they
have
no
desire
to
be
reached
sometimes
as
on
that
afternoon
when
the
child
came
and
wanted
to
hear
we
find
one
who
has
desire
but
the
greater
number
have
none
and
except
in
the
more
advanced
towns
and
villages
where
they
are
allowed
to
learn
with
a
they
have
hardly
a
chance
to
hear
enough
to
make
them
want
to
hear
more
then
as
if
to
make
the
case
doubly
hard
and
this
law
applies
to
every
woman
of
whatever
caste
she
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
the
property
of
her
husband
and
though
a
christian
can
not
by
law
compel
his
hindu
wife
to
live
with
him
a
hindu
husband
can
compel
his
christian
wife
to
live
with
him
so
that
no
married
woman
is
ever
legally
free
to
be
a
christian
for
if
the
husband
demanded
her
back
she
could
not
be
protected
but
would
have
to
be
given
up
to
a
life
which
no
english
woman
could
bear
to
contemplate
she
may
say
she
is
a
christian
he
cares
nought
for
what
she
says
god
help
the
woman
thus
forced
back
but
believing
a
higher
power
will
step
in
than
the
power
of
this
most
unjust
law
we
would
risk
any
penalty
and
receive
such
a
wife
should
she
come
only
in
dealing
with
the
difficulties
and
barriers
which
lie
between
an
indian
woman
and
life
as
a
free
christian
it
is
useless
to
shut
one
eyes
to
this
last
and
least
comprehensible
of
all
difficulties
an
english
law
imported
into
india
and
enforced
with
imprisonment
an
obsolete
english
law
we
have
no
brahman
women
converts
in
our
tamil
mission
we
hear
of
a
few
in
travancore
we
know
of
more
in
the
north
where
the
brahmans
are
more
numerous
and
less
exclusive
but
there
is
not
a
single
brahman
convert
woman
or
child
in
the
whole
of
this
district
there
was
one
a
very
old
woman
but
she
died
two
years
ago
we
may
comfort
ourselves
with
the
thought
that
surely
some
of
those
who
have
heard
have
become
secret
believers
but
will
a
true
believer
remain
secret
always
we
may
trust
that
many
a
dear
little
child
died
young
loving
jesus
and
went
to
him
but
what
about
those
who
have
not
died
young
i
know
that
a
brighter
view
may
be
taken
and
if
the
sadder
has
been
emphasised
in
these
letters
it
is
only
because
we
feel
you
know
less
about
it
for
more
has
been
written
about
the
successes
than
about
the
failures
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
more
important
that
you
should
know
about
the
reverses
than
about
the
successes
of
the
war
we
shall
have
all
eternity
to
celebrate
the
victories
but
we
have
only
the
few
hours
before
sunset
in
which
to
win
them
we
are
not
winning
them
as
we
should
because
the
fact
of
the
reverses
is
so
little
realised
and
the
needed
reinforcements
are
not
forthcoming
as
they
would
be
if
the
position
were
thoroughly
understood
reinforcements
of
men
and
women
are
needed
but
far
above
all
reinforcements
of
prayer
and
so
we
have
tried
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
uninteresting
unromantic
truth
about
the
heathen
as
we
find
them
the
work
as
it
is
more
workers
are
needed
no
words
can
tell
how
much
they
are
needed
how
much
they
are
here
but
we
will
never
try
to
allure
anyone
to
think
of
coming
by
painting
coloured
pictures
when
the
facts
are
in
black
and
white
what
if
black
and
white
will
never
attract
like
colours
we
care
not
for
it
our
business
is
to
tell
the
truth
the
work
is
not
a
pretty
thing
to
be
looked
at
and
admired
it
is
a
fight
and
battlefields
are
not
beautiful
but
if
one
is
truly
called
of
god
all
the
difficulties
and
discouragements
only
intensify
the
call
if
things
were
easier
there
would
be
less
need
the
greater
the
need
the
clearer
the
call
rings
through
one
the
deeper
the
conviction
grows
was
god
and
as
one
obeys
it
there
is
the
joy
of
obedience
quite
apart
from
the
joy
of
success
there
is
joy
in
being
with
jesus
in
a
place
where
his
friends
are
few
and
sometimes
when
one
would
least
expect
it
coming
home
tired
out
and
disheartened
after
a
day
in
an
opposing
or
indifferent
town
suddenly
how
you
can
hardly
tell
such
a
wave
of
the
joy
of
jesus
flows
over
you
and
through
you
that
you
are
stilled
with
the
sense
of
utter
joy
then
when
you
see
him
winning
souls
or
hear
of
your
comrades
victories
oh
all
that
is
within
you
sings
i
have
more
than
an
overweight
of
joy
chapter
xix
attracted
by
the
influence
it
seems
to
have
been
a
mistake
to
imagine
that
the
divine
majesty
on
high
was
too
exalted
to
take
any
notice
of
our
mean
affairs
the
great
minds
among
us
are
remarkable
for
the
attention
they
bestow
upon
minutiæ
sparrow
can
not
fall
to
the
ground
without
your
father
livingstone
we
have
now
left
dohnavur
on
the
west
and
returned
to
our
old
battlefield
on
the
east
the
evening
after
our
arrival
one
of
those
special
things
happened
though
only
a
little
thing
some
will
say
a
little
child
was
brought
illustration
this
is
not
is
tinier
and
has
more
sparkle
but
the
caste
is
the
same
and
as
we
have
not
got
we
put
this
small
girl
here
there
is
a
temple
in
the
hindu
village
near
us
we
have
often
tried
to
reach
the
temple
women
poor
slaves
of
the
brahmans
we
have
often
seen
the
little
girls
some
of
them
bought
as
infants
from
their
mothers
and
trained
to
the
terrible
life
in
one
of
the
mission
day
schools
there
is
a
child
who
was
sold
by
her
christian
mother
to
these
servants
of
the
gods
but
though
this
is
known
it
can
not
be
proved
and
the
child
has
no
wish
to
leave
the
life
and
she
can
not
be
taken
by
force
sometimes
we
see
the
little
girls
playing
in
the
courtyards
of
the
houses
near
the
temple
gracious
little
maidens
winsome
in
their
ways
almost
always
more
refined
in
manner
than
ordinary
children
and
often
beautiful
one
longs
to
help
the
little
things
but
no
hand
of
ours
can
stretch
over
the
wall
and
lift
even
one
child
out
among
the
little
temple
girls
in
the
great
lake
village
was
a
tiny
girl
called
of
whom
we
knew
nothing
but
god
must
have
some
purpose
for
her
for
he
sent
his
angel
to
the
house
one
afternoon
and
the
angel
found
little
and
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
out
across
the
stream
and
through
the
wood
to
a
christian
house
in
our
village
next
morning
she
brought
her
to
us
this
is
what
really
happened
i
think
there
is
no
other
way
to
account
for
it
no
one
remembers
such
a
thing
happening
here
before
i
was
sitting
reading
in
the
verandah
when
i
saw
them
come
the
woman
was
looking
surprised
she
did
not
know
about
the
angel
i
expect
and
she
could
not
understand
it
at
all
the
little
child
was
chattering
away
lifting
up
a
bright
little
face
as
she
talked
when
she
saw
me
she
ran
straight
up
to
me
and
climbed
on
my
knee
without
the
least
fear
and
told
me
all
about
herself
at
once
i
took
her
to
the
iyer
and
he
sent
for
the
pastor
who
sent
a
messenger
to
the
village
of
the
lake
to
say
the
child
was
here
and
to
inquire
into
the
truth
of
her
story
my
name
is
the
child
began
and
i
want
to
stay
here
always
i
have
come
to
stay
and
she
told
us
how
her
mother
had
sold
her
when
she
was
a
baby
to
the
servants
of
the
gods
she
was
not
happy
with
them
they
did
not
love
her
nobody
loved
her
she
wanted
to
live
with
us
but
why
had
she
run
away
now
she
hardly
seemed
to
know
and
looked
puzzled
at
our
questions
the
only
thing
she
was
sure
about
was
that
she
had
run
and
come
and
that
she
wanted
to
stay
then
the
ammal
came
in
and
she
went
through
exactly
the
same
story
with
her
we
felt
if
this
proved
to
be
fact
that
we
could
surely
keep
her
the
government
would
be
on
our
side
in
such
a
matter
only
the
great
difficulty
might
be
to
prove
it
meanwhile
we
gave
her
a
doll
and
her
little
heart
was
at
rest
she
did
not
seem
to
have
a
fear
with
the
prettiest
most
confiding
little
gesture
she
sat
down
at
our
feet
and
began
to
play
with
it
we
watched
her
wonderingly
she
was
perfectly
at
home
with
us
she
ran
out
gathered
leaves
and
flowers
and
came
back
with
them
these
were
carefully
arranged
in
rows
on
the
floor
then
another
expedition
and
in
again
with
three
pebbles
for
hearthstones
a
shell
for
a
cooking
pot
bits
of
straw
for
firewood
a
stick
for
a
match
and
sand
for
rice
she
went
through
all
the
minutiæ
of
tamil
cookery
with
the
greatest
seriousness
then
we
together
with
her
doll
were
invited
to
partake
the
little
thing
walked
straight
into
our
hearts
and
we
felt
we
would
risk
anything
to
keep
her
our
messenger
returned
the
story
was
true
the
women
from
whose
house
she
had
come
were
certainly
temple
women
but
would
they
admit
it
to
us
and
above
all
would
they
admit
they
had
obtained
her
illegally
a
fact
easy
to
deny
almost
upon
this
they
came
and
to
the
question
who
are
you
one
said
we
are
servants
of
the
gods
i
heard
an
instructive
aside
why
did
you
tell
them
oh
never
mind
said
the
one
who
had
answered
they
do
understand
but
we
had
understood
and
we
were
thankful
for
the
first
point
gained
they
stood
and
stared
and
called
the
child
but
she
would
not
go
and
we
would
not
force
her
then
they
went
away
and
we
were
left
for
an
hour
in
that
curious
quiet
which
comes
before
a
storm
our
poor
little
girl
was
frightened
oh
if
they
come
again
hide
me
she
begged
one
saw
it
was
almost
too
much
for
her
child
though
she
is
the
next
was
worse
a
great
crowd
gathered
on
the
verandah
and
an
woman
who
seemed
to
have
some
sort
of
power
over
fiercely
demanded
her
back
when
we
refused
to
make
her
go
the
woman
whose
very
glance
sent
a
tremble
through
the
little
one
declared
that
must
say
out
loud
that
she
would
not
go
with
her
out
loud
so
that
all
should
hear
but
the
poor
little
thing
was
dumb
with
fear
she
just
stood
and
looked
and
shivered
we
could
not
persuade
her
to
say
a
word
star
was
hovering
near
she
had
been
through
it
all
herself
before
and
her
face
was
anxious
and
our
hearts
were
i
know
it
is
impossible
to
describe
such
a
life
to
you
it
has
to
be
lived
through
to
be
understood
the
clamour
and
excitement
and
the
feeling
of
how
much
hangs
on
the
word
of
a
child
who
does
not
properly
understand
what
she
is
accepting
or
refusing
the
tension
is
terrible
i
dared
not
go
near
her
lest
they
should
think
i
was
bewitching
her
any
movement
on
my
part
towards
her
would
have
been
the
signal
for
a
rush
on
theirs
but
i
signed
to
star
to
take
her
away
for
a
moment
the
bewilderment
on
the
poor
little
face
was
frightening
me
one
more
look
up
at
that
woman
one
more
pull
at
the
strained
cord
and
to
their
question
will
you
come
she
might
as
likely
say
yes
as
no
star
carried
her
off
once
out
of
reach
of
those
eyes
the
words
came
fast
enough
star
told
me
she
clung
to
her
and
sobbed
oh
if
i
say
no
she
will
catch
me
and
punish
me
dreadfully
afterwards
she
will
i
know
she
will
and
she
showed
cuts
in
the
soft
brown
skin
where
she
had
been
punished
before
but
star
soothed
her
and
brought
her
back
and
she
stood
such
a
little
girl
before
them
all
i
wo
i
wo
she
cried
and
she
turned
and
ran
back
with
star
and
the
crowd
went
off
and
i
was
glad
to
see
the
last
of
that
fearful
face
with
its
evil
cruel
eyes
but
they
said
they
would
write
to
the
mother
who
had
given
her
to
them
we
noted
this
the
second
point
we
should
have
to
prove
if
they
lodged
a
suit
against
us
and
any
day
the
mother
may
come
and
complicate
matters
by
working
on
the
child
affections
also
we
have
heard
of
a
plot
to
decoy
her
away
should
we
be
for
a
moment
off
guard
so
we
are
very
much
on
the
watch
and
we
never
let
her
out
of
our
sight
by
this
time
it
is
five
days
since
she
came
it
seems
impossible
to
think
of
having
ever
been
without
her
apart
from
her
story
which
would
touch
anyone
there
is
her
little
personality
which
is
very
interesting
she
plays
all
day
long
with
her
precious
dolls
talking
to
them
telling
them
everything
we
tell
her
yesterday
it
was
a
bible
story
a
new
chorus
she
insisted
on
her
infant
coming
to
church
with
her
and
it
had
to
have
its
collection
too
everything
is
most
realistic
tamil
children
usually
hang
their
dolls
up
by
their
limbs
to
a
nail
in
the
wall
or
stow
them
away
on
a
shelf
but
this
mite
has
imagination
and
much
sympathy
in
thinking
over
it
as
bit
by
bit
her
little
story
came
to
light
we
have
been
struck
by
the
touches
that
tell
how
god
cares
the
time
of
her
coming
told
of
care
some
months
earlier
the
temple
woman
who
kept
her
had
burnt
her
little
fingers
across
as
a
punishment
for
some
childish
fault
and
ran
away
she
knew
what
she
wanted
her
mother
she
knew
that
her
mother
lived
in
a
town
twenty
miles
to
the
east
it
was
a
long
way
for
a
little
girl
to
walk
but
some
kind
people
found
me
on
the
road
and
they
were
going
to
the
same
town
and
they
let
me
go
with
them
so
i
was
not
afraid
only
i
was
very
tired
when
we
got
there
it
took
three
days
to
walk
i
did
not
know
where
my
mother
lived
in
the
town
and
it
was
a
very
big
town
but
i
described
my
mother
to
the
people
in
the
streets
and
at
last
i
found
my
mother
for
just
a
little
while
there
was
something
of
the
my
mother
cried
but
the
temple
woman
had
traced
her
and
followed
her
and
the
mother
gave
her
up
then
comes
a
blank
in
the
story
she
only
remembers
she
was
lonely
and
she
felt
a
about
the
world
and
wandered
wearily
as
restless
as
a
bird
grown
chill
through
something
being
away
though
what
it
knows
not
then
comes
a
bit
of
life
distinct
in
every
detail
and
told
with
terribly
unchildish
horror
she
heard
them
whisper
together
about
her
they
did
not
know
that
she
understood
she
was
to
be
married
to
the
god
tied
to
a
stone
terrified
she
flew
to
the
temple
slipped
past
the
brahmans
crossed
the
court
stood
before
the
god
in
the
dim
of
the
shrine
clasped
her
hands
she
showed
us
how
prayed
to
it
pleaded
let
me
die
oh
let
me
die
barely
seven
years
old
and
she
prayed
oh
let
me
die
she
tried
to
run
away
again
if
she
had
come
to
our
village
then
she
could
not
have
been
saved
we
were
in
dohnavur
and
there
was
no
one
here
who
could
have
protected
her
against
the
temple
people
so
god
kept
her
from
coming
then
about
that
time
one
afternoon
one
of
our
tamil
sisters
whom
we
had
left
behind
to
hold
the
fort
passed
through
the
great
lake
village
and
the
temple
women
called
the
child
and
said
see
it
is
she
the
ammal
run
it
was
only
said
to
frighten
her
but
it
did
a
different
work
one
day
day
after
we
the
thought
suddenly
came
to
her
i
will
go
and
look
for
that
ammal
and
she
wandered
away
in
the
twilight
and
came
to
our
village
and
stood
alone
in
front
of
the
church
and
no
one
knew
there
one
of
our
christian
women
servant
of
jesus
by
name
found
her
some
time
afterwards
a
very
small
and
desolate
mite
with
tumbled
hair
and
troubled
eyes
for
she
could
not
find
the
one
she
sought
that
ammal
she
wanted
so
much
and
she
was
frightened
all
alone
in
the
gathering
dark
by
this
big
big
church
and
very
big
it
must
have
looked
to
so
tiny
a
thing
as
she
servant
of
jesus
thought
at
first
of
taking
the
little
one
back
to
her
home
but
mercifully
it
was
late
another
touch
of
the
hand
of
god
and
so
instead
she
took
her
straight
to
her
own
little
house
which
satisfied
perfectly
but
she
would
not
touch
the
curry
and
rice
the
kind
woman
offered
her
she
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
small
height
and
said
with
the
greatest
dignity
am
i
not
a
vellala
child
may
you
ask
me
to
break
my
caste
so
servant
of
jesus
gave
her
some
sugar
that
being
ceremonially
safe
and
ate
it
hungrily
and
then
went
off
to
sleep
next
morning
again
the
woman
first
thought
was
to
take
her
to
her
own
people
but
the
child
was
so
insistent
that
she
wanted
the
ammal
that
servant
of
jesus
thinking
i
was
the
ammal
she
meant
for
this
is
one
of
my
various
names
brought
her
to
me
as
i
have
said
and
oh
i
am
glad
she
did
nothing
escapes
those
clear
brown
eyes
that
morning
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
one
of
the
temple
women
called
out
that
the
child
was
a
wicked
thief
this
is
an
ordinary
charge
they
think
it
will
compel
submission
we
will
make
out
a
case
and
send
the
police
to
drag
you
off
to
gaol
they
yell
and
sometimes
there
is
risk
of
serious
trouble
for
a
case
can
be
made
out
cheaply
in
india
but
this
did
not
promise
to
be
serious
so
we
inquired
the
stolen
sum
it
came
to
fourpence
halfpenny
which
we
paid
for
the
sake
of
peace
though
she
told
them
where
the
money
was
and
we
found
out
later
that
she
had
told
the
truth
i
never
thought
she
would
remember
it
the
excitements
of
the
day
crowded
it
out
of
my
mind
but
weeks
afterwards
when
i
was
teaching
her
the
text
not
redeemed
with
corruptible
things
as
silver
and
gold
and
explaining
how
much
jesus
had
paid
for
us
she
interrupted
me
with
the
remark
oh
yes
i
understand
i
know
how
much
you
paid
for
me
fourpence
halfpenny
and
now
to
turn
from
things
to
large
ragland
tamil
missionary
is
writing
to
a
friend
in
he
is
trying
to
express
astronomically
the
value
of
a
soul
he
asks
how
does
the
astronomer
correct
the
knowledge
of
the
stars
which
simple
vision
brings
him
first
having
discovered
that
the
little
dot
of
light
is
thousands
of
miles
distant
and
having
discerned
by
the
telescope
that
it
subtends
at
the
eye
a
sensible
angle
and
having
measured
that
angle
a
simple
calculation
shows
him
the
size
of
the
object
to
be
greater
perhaps
than
that
of
the
huge
ball
which
he
calls
his
earth
then
take
the
soul
of
one
of
the
poorest
lowest
pariahs
of
india
and
form
it
by
imagination
into
or
suppose
it
represented
by
a
sphere
place
this
at
the
extremity
of
a
line
which
is
to
represent
time
extend
this
line
and
move
off
your
sphere
farther
and
farther
and
what
has
become
of
your
sphere
why
there
it
is
just
as
before
it
is
still
what
it
was
and
this
even
after
thousands
of
years
in
short
the
disc
appears
undiminished
though
viewed
from
an
almost
infinite
distance
what
an
angle
of
the
mind
ought
that
poor
soul
to
subtend
the
letter
goes
on
to
suggest
another
parallel
between
things
astronomical
and
things
spiritual
he
supposes
an
objector
admits
the
size
as
proved
but
demurs
as
to
the
importance
of
these
heavenly
bodies
they
are
perhaps
only
unsubstantial
froth
mere
puffs
of
air
vapoury
nothings
but
the
astronomer
knows
their
mass
and
weight
as
well
as
their
size
long
observation
has
taught
him
that
planets
in
the
neighbourhood
of
one
given
heavenly
body
have
been
turned
out
of
their
course
how
and
by
what
he
is
at
first
quite
at
a
loss
to
tell
but
he
has
guessed
and
reasoned
has
found
cause
for
suspecting
the
planet
he
watches
observes
and
compares
and
after
a
long
sifting
of
evidence
he
brings
it
in
guilty
of
the
disturbance
if
it
be
so
it
must
have
a
power
to
disturb
a
power
to
attract
and
if
so
it
is
not
a
mere
shell
much
less
a
mere
vapour
it
has
mass
and
it
has
weight
and
he
calculates
and
determines
from
the
disturbances
what
that
weight
is
just
so
with
the
pariah
soul
oh
what
a
disturbance
has
it
created
what
a
celestial
body
has
it
drawn
out
from
its
celestial
sphere
not
a
star
not
the
whole
visible
heavens
not
the
heaven
of
heavens
itself
but
him
who
fills
heaven
and
earth
by
whom
all
things
were
created
did
that
pariah
soul
attract
from
heaven
even
to
earth
to
save
it
oh
that
we
would
thence
learn
and
learning
lay
to
heart
the
weight
and
the
value
of
that
one
and
just
as
the
majesty
of
the
glory
of
the
lord
is
shown
forth
nowhere
more
majestically
than
in
the
chapter
which
tells
us
how
he
feeds
his
flock
like
a
shepherd
and
gathers
the
lambs
with
his
arm
and
carries
them
in
his
bosom
so
nowhere
i
think
do
we
see
the
glory
of
our
god
more
than
in
chapters
of
life
which
show
him
bending
down
from
the
circle
of
the
earth
yea
rather
coming
down
all
the
way
to
help
it
attracted
by
the
influence
of
the
need
of
a
little
child
chapter
xx
the
elf
you
remember
what
i
said
once
that
you
could
not
perhaps
put
a
whole
crown
on
the
head
of
jesus
that
is
bring
a
whole
country
to
be
his
but
you
might
put
one
little
jewel
in
his
crown
french
india
and
otherwise
the
elf
because
it
exactly
describes
her
was
very
good
for
the
first
few
weeks
after
which
we
began
to
know
her
she
is
not
a
convert
in
any
sense
of
the
term
she
is
just
a
very
wilful
truthful
exasperating
fascinating
little
oriental
when
she
is
as
she
expresses
it
moved
to
sin
nobody
of
her
own
colour
can
manage
her
you
are
only
grown
up
is
her
attitude
towards
them
all
she
is
always
ready
to
repent
but
as
pearl
sorrowfully
says
before
her
tears
are
dry
she
goes
and
sins
again
and
then
quite
unabashed
she
will
trot
up
to
you
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
expect
to
be
lavishly
petted
i
never
saw
anyone
except
the
elf
look
interesting
when
naughty
she
does
look
interesting
she
is
a
rather
light
brown
and
any
emotion
makes
the
brown
lighter
her
long
lashes
droop
over
her
eyes
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
and
when
she
looks
up
appealingly
she
might
be
an
innocent
martyr
about
to
die
for
her
faith
we
have
two
other
small
girls
with
us
the
imp
but
her
name
is
a
libel
she
reformed
some
months
ago
and
tangles
who
ties
herself
into
knots
whenever
she
makes
a
remark
these
three
have
many
an
argument
for
indian
children
delight
in
discussion
and
sometimes
the
things
that
are
brought
to
me
would
shock
the
orthodox
this
is
the
last
brought
yesterday
obedience
is
not
so
important
as
love
orpah
was
very
obedient
her
said
return
and
she
did
as
she
was
told
but
ruth
was
not
obedient
at
all
four
times
her
said
and
yet
she
would
not
go
but
god
blessed
ruth
much
more
than
orpah
because
she
loved
her
so
obedience
is
not
so
important
as
love
only
the
day
before
i
had
been
labouring
to
explain
the
absolute
necessity
for
the
cultivation
of
the
grace
of
obedience
but
now
it
was
proved
a
secondary
matter
for
ruth
was
certainly
disobedient
but
good
and
greatly
blessed
the
elf
chief
delinquencies
at
present
however
spring
from
a
rooted
aversion
to
her
share
in
the
family
housework
ten
minutes
rubbing
up
of
brass
an
appetite
for
slate
pencils
she
would
nibble
them
by
the
inch
if
we
would
let
her
they
are
so
nice
to
eat
she
says
and
most
fruitful
of
all
in
sad
consequences
a
love
of
being
first
as
regards
sin
no
i
hope
it
will
soon
be
a
thing
of
the
past
for
she
has
just
made
a
valuable
discovery
satan
does
come
very
close
to
me
if
i
sing
all
the
time
i
rubbing
the
brasses
he
runs
away
when
he
hears
me
sing
so
i
sing
very
loud
and
that
keeps
him
away
satan
does
like
hymns
and
i
quite
agree
and
strongly
advise
her
to
persevere
sin
no
is
likely
to
pass
as
she
hates
the
nasty
medicine
we
give
her
to
correct
her
depraved
proclivities
but
no
is
more
serious
it
opens
the
door
or
as
she
once
expressed
it
it
calls
so
many
other
sins
to
come
quarrelling
pride
and
several
varieties
of
temper
come
at
the
call
of
this
sin
no
she
is
a
born
leader
in
her
very
small
way
and
she
has
not
learned
yet
that
before
we
can
lead
we
must
be
willing
to
be
led
i
will
choose
the
game
she
remarks
and
all
of
you
must
do
as
i
tell
you
sometimes
they
do
for
her
directions
though
decisive
are
given
with
a
certain
grace
that
wins
obedience
but
sometimes
they
do
not
and
then
the
elf
is
offended
and
walks
off
but
she
is
the
life
of
the
game
and
they
chase
her
and
propitiate
her
and
she
generally
condescends
to
return
for
solitary
dignity
is
dull
if
any
of
the
seniors
happen
to
see
it
it
is
checked
as
much
as
possible
but
oftener
we
hear
of
it
in
that
very
informing
prayer
which
is
to
her
quite
the
event
of
the
evening
for
she
takes
to
the
outward
forms
of
religion
with
great
avidity
and
the
evening
prayer
especially
is
a
deep
delight
to
her
she
counts
up
all
her
numerous
shortcomings
carefully
and
perfectly
truthfully
as
they
appear
to
her
and
with
equal
accuracy
her
blessings
large
and
small
she
sometimes
includes
her
good
deeds
in
the
list
lest
i
suppose
they
should
be
forgotten
in
the
record
of
the
day
all
the
latent
in
human
nature
comes
out
or
used
to
in
her
earlier
days
in
the
evening
revelations
here
is
a
specimen
taken
at
random
from
the
first
month
sheaf
she
and
the
imp
had
come
to
my
room
for
their
devotions
preternaturally
pious
both
of
them
though
quite
unregenerate
it
was
the
elf
turn
to
begin
she
settled
herself
circumspectly
sighed
deeply
and
then
began
first
came
the
day
sins
counted
on
the
fingers
of
the
right
hand
beginning
with
the
fourth
finger
once
and
down
went
the
little
finger
on
the
palm
i
was
cross
with
being
the
imp
nine
and
a
half
to
the
elf
seven
and
a
half
but
most
submissive
as
a
rule
i
was
cross
because
she
did
not
do
as
i
told
her
that
was
wrong
of
me
but
it
was
wrong
of
her
too
so
it
was
only
half
a
sin
twice
and
the
third
finger
was
folded
down
when
i
did
not
do
my
work
well
that
was
quite
all
my
fault
three
times
and
down
went
the
middle
finger
when
i
caught
a
quarrel
with
those
naughty
little
children
they
were
stupid
little
children
and
they
would
not
play
my
game
so
i
spoiled
unity
but
they
came
running
after
me
and
they
said
forgive
us
so
i
forgave
them
that
was
very
good
of
me
and
i
also
forgave
so
that
is
three
bad
things
and
two
good
things
i
stopped
her
and
expatiated
on
the
sin
of
pride
but
her
mind
was
full
of
the
business
in
hand
then
there
were
four
blessings
no
five
but
i
ca
remember
the
fifth
the
ammal
gave
me
a
box
for
my
doll
and
you
gave
me
some
sweets
and
i
found
some
nice
rags
in
your
basket
grubbing
in
and
baskets
is
one
of
the
joys
of
life
rags
are
so
useful
when
you
have
a
large
family
of
dolls
who
are
always
wearing
out
their
clothes
and
i
have
some
cakes
in
my
own
box
now
there
are
four
blessings
but
i
forget
the
fifth
i
advised
her
to
leave
it
and
begin
for
the
imp
was
patiently
waiting
her
turn
she
good
child
suggested
the
missing
fifth
must
be
the
soap
the
ammal
had
given
each
of
them
a
piece
the
size
of
a
walnut
yes
that
was
it
apparently
for
the
elf
contented
began
o
loving
lord
jesus
i
have
done
three
wrong
things
then
followed
the
details
and
prayer
for
forgiveness
lord
give
grace
to
do
what
i
want
her
to
do
and
when
she
does
not
do
it
lord
give
me
grace
to
be
patient
with
her
i
thank
thee
for
causing
me
to
forgive
those
little
children
who
would
not
play
the
game
i
liked
oh
make
them
good
and
make
me
also
good
and
next
time
we
play
together
give
me
grace
to
play
patiently
with
them
and
oh
forgive
all
the
bad
things
i
have
done
and
i
thank
thee
very
much
for
all
the
good
things
i
have
done
for
i
did
them
by
thy
grace
praise
for
mercies
followed
in
order
the
cardboard
box
the
lump
of
the
spoils
from
the
basket
those
sticky
which
to
my
disquietude
i
then
understood
were
secreted
in
her
seeley
box
and
that
precious
bit
of
soap
then
and
this
is
never
omitted
a
fervently
expressed
desire
for
safe
preservation
for
herself
and
her
friends
from
the
bites
of
snakes
and
scorpions
and
all
other
noxious
creatures
through
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
when
i
wake
may
i
find
myself
at
thy
holy
feet
amen
no
matter
how
sleepy
she
is
these
last
phrases
which
are
quite
of
her
own
devising
are
always
included
in
the
of
her
prayer
she
would
not
feel
at
all
safe
on
her
mat
spread
on
the
ground
out
of
doors
in
hot
weather
unless
she
had
so
fortified
herself
from
all
attacks
of
the
reptile
world
and
when
one
day
we
discovered
a
nest
of
some
few
dozen
scorpions
within
six
yards
of
her
mat
not
one
of
which
had
ever
disturbed
her
or
any
of
her
friends
we
really
did
feel
that
funny
little
prayer
had
power
in
it
after
all
you
can
not
interrupt
in
the
middle
of
those
rather
confusing
confessions
she
is
far
too
much
engaged
to
be
disturbed
but
when
the
communication
is
fairly
over
and
she
cuddles
on
your
knee
for
the
kissing
and
caressing
she
so
much
appreciates
you
have
a
chance
of
explaining
things
a
little
she
listened
seriously
that
evening
i
remember
then
slipping
down
off
my
knee
she
added
as
a
sort
of
postscript
very
reverently
o
lord
jesus
i
prayed
it
wrong
i
was
naughtier
than
much
naughtier
but
indeed
thou
wilt
remember
that
she
was
naughty
first
oh
not
it
it
was
not
it
was
me
and
i
was
impatient
with
those
little
children
but
but
they
caused
impatience
within
me
then
getting
hopelessly
mixed
up
between
and
she
gave
it
up
adding
however
next
time
we
play
together
give
more
grace
to
play
patiently
with
me
which
was
so
far
satisfactory
as
at
first
she
had
scouted
the
idea
that
there
could
be
any
need
of
patience
on
the
other
side
sometimes
she
brings
me
perplexities
not
new
to
most
of
us
this
morning
i
prayed
with
great
desire
keep
me
from
being
naughty
at
all
and
i
was
naughty
an
hour
afterwards
i
looked
at
the
clock
and
saw
how
was
it
i
was
naughty
when
i
wanted
to
be
good
the
naughtiness
jumped
up
inside
me
so
illustrating
its
supposed
action
within
and
it
came
running
out
so
what
is
the
use
of
praying
once
the
difficulty
was
rather
opposite
can
you
be
good
without
god
grace
i
told
her
i
certainly
could
not
well
i
can
she
answered
delightedly
i
want
to
pray
now
now
it
is
eight
now
have
you
had
prayer
long
ago
we
all
get
up
at
six
no
that
just
what
i
meant
i
skipped
my
prayer
this
morning
and
so
of
course
i
got
no
grace
but
i
have
been
helping
the
elder
sisters
was
that
right
yes
quite
right
and
yet
i
had
got
any
grace
but
i
suppose
she
added
reflectively
it
was
the
grace
over
from
yesterday
that
did
it
as
a
rule
she
is
not
distinguished
for
very
deep
penitence
but
at
one
time
she
had
what
she
called
a
true
sense
of
sin
which
fluctuated
rather
but
was
always
hailed
when
it
appeared
in
force
as
a
sign
of
better
things
after
a
day
of
mixed
goodness
and
badness
the
elf
prayed
most
devoutly
i
thank
thee
for
giving
me
a
sense
of
sin
o
god
keep
me
from
being
at
all
naughty
but
if
i
am
naughty
lord
give
me
a
true
sense
of
sin
illustration
we
value
this
photo
exceedingly
it
was
so
hard
to
get
we
were
in
a
big
heathen
village
when
we
saw
this
ugly
duckling
in
fact
she
was
one
of
the
most
tiresome
of
the
rabbits
mentioned
in
chapter
i
she
saw
us
and
darted
off
and
climbed
a
wall
and
made
faces
at
us
in
a
truly
delightful
manner
we
thought
we
would
take
her
and
tried
as
well
try
to
pick
up
quicksilver
she
would
not
be
caught
the
deed
was
finally
done
when
she
had
not
the
least
idea
of
it
and
the
camera
gave
a
triumphant
click
as
it
snapped
her
unawares
what
do
they
want
her
for
inquired
a
bystander
who
had
observed
our
little
game
look
at
her
hair
said
another
they
never
saw
hair
like
that
in
england
that
what
they
want
her
for
professor
drummond
speaks
of
our
whole
life
as
a
breath
of
mystery
between
the
two
great
wonders
the
first
awakening
and
the
last
sleep
i
often
think
of
that
as
i
listen
to
the
little
children
talking
to
each
other
and
to
us
they
are
always
wondering
about
something
one
day
it
was
do
fishes
love
jesus
followed
by
what
is
a
soul
the
conclusion
was
it
the
thing
we
love
jesus
with
when
they
first
come
to
us
they
invariably
think
that
mountains
grow
like
trees
stones
are
young
mountains
are
they
and
hills
are
mountains
later
on
every
printed
thing
on
a
wall
is
a
text
we
were
in
a
railway
station
on
our
way
to
the
hills
look
oh
what
numbers
and
numbers
of
texts
but
what
queer
pictures
to
have
on
texts
one
was
specially
perplexing
it
was
a
advertisement
and
the
picture
showed
a
monkey
smoking
a
cigar
what
could
that
depraved
animal
have
to
do
with
when
we
got
to
the
hills
the
first
amazement
was
the
sight
of
the
fashionable
ladies
wearing
veils
do
they
like
to
look
at
beautiful
world
do
they
like
it
better
tangles
has
another
name
it
is
the
ugly
duckling
and
it
is
extremely
descriptive
but
ugly
duckling
or
not
she
is
of
an
inquiring
turn
of
mind
and
one
saturday
afternoon
after
standing
under
a
tree
for
fully
five
minutes
lost
in
thought
she
came
to
me
with
a
question
what
are
the
birds
saying
to
each
other
i
looked
at
the
ugly
duckling
and
she
twisted
herself
into
a
note
of
interrogation
in
the
ridiculous
way
she
has
but
her
face
was
full
of
anxiety
for
enlightenment
about
the
language
of
the
sparrows
there
she
said
pointing
vigorously
to
the
astonished
birds
which
instantly
flew
away
that
little
sparrow
and
this
one
are
making
quite
different
noises
what
are
they
saying
i
do
want
to
know
so
much
as
i
imagined
the
birds
in
question
had
just
been
having
supper
i
told
her
what
i
thought
they
were
probably
saying
next
day
in
the
sermon
there
was
something
about
the
praise
all
creation
offers
to
god
and
i
saw
tangles
knotting
her
hands
together
and
going
into
the
queerest
contortions
in
appreciation
of
the
one
bit
of
the
sermon
she
could
understand
the
imp
questions
were
various
what
is
that
pointing
to
a
clock
is
it
an
english
kind
of
insect
do
its
legs
get
tired
going
round
oh
is
it
dead
now
when
it
stopped
who
made
satan
was
an
early
one
why
does
god
kill
him
immediately
and
stamp
on
him
one
day
i
was
trying
to
find
and
touch
her
heart
by
telling
her
how
very
sorry
jesus
is
when
we
are
naughty
she
seemed
subdued
then
amma
where
was
the
queen
spirit
after
she
died
and
before
they
buried
her
what
did
they
give
it
to
did
you
see
lot
wife
was
a
question
which
tickled
the
bishop
when
on
his
last
visitation
he
gave
himself
up
to
an
hour
catechising
upon
his
tour
in
the
holy
land
they
were
disappointed
that
he
had
to
confess
he
had
not
oh
i
suppose
the
salt
has
melted
was
the
elf
comment
upon
this
tangles
is
distinctly
inclined
to
peace
the
elf
i
grieve
to
say
is
not
yesterday
she
announced
a
quarrel
i
feel
cross
tangles
objected
to
quarrel
i
do
feel
cross
and
the
elf
apparently
showed
corroborative
symptoms
then
tangles
looked
at
her
straight
i
not
going
to
quarrel
the
devil
has
arrived
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
to
interrupt
our
unity
and
i
wo
let
him
which
so
touched
the
elf
that
she
embraced
her
on
the
spot
and
then
in
detailing
it
all
in
her
prayer
in
the
evening
this
incorrigible
little
sinner
added
with
real
emotion
lord
i
am
not
good
i
spoiled
unity
with
the
imp
and
thou
didst
feel
obliged
to
remove
her
to
a
now
do
help
me
not
to
spoil
unity
with
who
is
tangles
lest
thou
shouldst
feel
obliged
to
remove
her
also
to
a
a
view
of
the
imp
promotion
which
had
not
struck
me
before
tangles
and
she
belong
to
the
same
caste
and
tangles
has
the
character
of
that
caste
as
fully
developed
as
the
elf
and
can
hold
her
own
effectually
also
she
is
a
little
older
and
taller
and
being
the
elder
sister
is
therefore
entitled
to
a
certain
measure
of
respect
all
those
small
things
tend
to
the
discipline
of
the
elf
who
is
very
small
for
her
age
and
who
would
have
preferred
a
junior
of
a
meek
and
mild
disposition
and
whose
constant
prayer
is
this
o
lord
bring
another
little
girl
out
of
the
lion
mouth
but
o
lord
please
let
her
be
a
little
shortly
after
this
prayer
began
a
very
little
girl
was
brought
but
she
was
a
vulgar
infant
and
greatly
tried
the
elf
and
she
was
for
various
reasons
promptly
returned
to
her
parents
after
this
episode
the
prayer
varied
somewhat
lord
let
her
be
a
child
and
give
me
grace
to
love
her
from
my
heart
when
she
comes
the
conversation
of
these
young
creatures
is
often
very
illuminating
and
always
most
miscellaneous
the
elf
mind
especially
is
a
sort
of
small
curiosity
shop
and
displays
many
assortments
the
elf

and
little
delight

youthful

curled
up
on
the
warm
red
sand
with
their
three
little
heads
close
together
the
elf
is
telling
a
story
i
listen
and
hear
a
marvellous
muddle
of
the
and
of
north
he
was
only
six
years
old
and
he
stood
up
and
said
you
are
going
to
do
do
quickly
i
am
not
afraid
i
am
going
to
the
golden
city
and
they
showed
him
the
sword
and
the
fire
and
he
said
it
quickly
and
they
chopped
off
his
arm
and
said
you
deny
jesus
and
he
said
and
they
chopped
off
his
other
arm
and
so
on
through
all
the
various
limbs
in
most
vivid
detail
and
then
they
threw
him
on
the
fire
and
burnt
him
till
he
was
ashes
and
he
sang
praises
to
jesus
the
elf
leans
to
the
tragic
tangles
mother
had
a
difference
of
opinion
with
a
friend
the
friend
snatched
at
her
opponent
ear
jewels
and
tore
the
ear
life
with
a
torn
ear
was
intolerable
so
tangles
mother
walked
three
times
round
the
well
repeated
three
times
my
blood
be
on
your
head
and
sprang
in
she
rose
three
times
each
time
said
the
same
words
and
then
sank
all
this
tangles
confided
to
the
elf
who
concocted
a
game
based
upon
the
incident
which
however
we
ruthlessly
squashed
they
are
tossing
pebbles
now
according
to
rules
of
their
own
and
talking
vigorously
the
ammal
told
me
all
the
people
in
england
are
white
and
i
asked
her
what
they
did
without
servants
and
she
said
they
had
white
servants
and
the
note
of
exclamation
is
intense
the
others
are
equally
astonished
white
people
as
servants
the
two
ideas
clash
they
have
never
seen
a
white
servant
in
all
their
extensive
acquaintance
with
white
people
they
have
only
seen
missionaries
who
are
truly
their
servants
though
they
hardly
realise
it
yet
and
occasionally
government
officials
whose
mastership
is
very
much
in
evidence
so
they
are
puzzled
they
get
out
of
the
difficulty
however
at
the
beginning
of
the
beginning
of
england
black
people
must
have
gone
to
be
the
white
people
servants
and
they
gradually
grew
white
yes
that
it
apparently
they
faded
the
conversation
springs
higher
do
you
know
what
lightning
is
tell
you
i
watched
it
one
whole
evening
and
i
think
it
just
a
little
bit
of
heaven
light
coming
through
and
going
back
again
this
sounds
probable
and
great
interest
is
aroused
they
are
discussing
the
sheet
lightning
which
plays
about
the
sky
in
the
evening
before
rain
of
course
it
is
much
of
heaven
light
only
a
little
tiny
bit
getting
out
and
running
down
here
to
show
us
what
it
is
like
inside
one
night
i
shut
my
eyes
and
it
ran
in
and
out
in
and
out
oh
so
fast
even
if
i
shut
my
eyes
i
saw
it
running
inside
my
eyes
did
you
get
caned
in
school
no
not
exactly
caned
and
an
explanation
follows
i
was
standing
beside
a
very
naughty
little
girl
and
the
teacher
meant
to
cane
her
but
the
cane
fell
on
me
by
mistake
i
wanted
to
cry
because
it
hurt
but
i
thought
it
would
be
silly
to
cry
when
it
hurt
me
quite
by
mistake
so
i
did
cry
one
tear
the
elf
hit
upon
a
capital
expedient
for
escaping
castigation
which
is
never
very
severe
i
found
this
cane
myself
it
was
lying
on
the
ground
in
the
compound
and
i
am
going
to
take
it
to
the
teacher
chorus
of
why
because
and
the
elf
looked
elfish
if
i
give
it
to
him
with
my
own
hands
how
will
he
cane
my
hands
with
it
his
heart
will
not
be
hard
enough
to
cane
me
with
the
cane
i
gave
him
and
the
little
scamp
looks
round
for
applause
chorus
of
admiring
oh
then
they
begin
again
the
elf
as
usual
chief
informant
i
know
something
chorus
what
a
beautiful
doll
is
waiting
for
me
in
a
box
and
i
going
to
have
it
at
what
sort
of
a
doll
is
the
eager
inquiry
i
do
know
exactly
but
god
sent
it
of
course
so
i
think
it
must
be
something
like
an
angel
chorus
delightedly
ah
yes
if
it
came
from
god
then
of
course
it
came
from
heaven
and
heaven
is
the
place
all
the
angels
come
from
and
they
are
white
and
shining
so
i
think
it
will
be
white
and
shining
like
an
angel
the
doll
in
question
is
a
negress
with
a
woolly
head
and
a
pinafore
it
had
not
struck
me
as
angelic
it
is
an
experiment
in
dolls
will
it
take
came
at
last
and
the
heavenly
doll
with
it
but
it
did
not
take
grievous
were
the
tears
and
sobs
and
the
bitterest
wail
of
all
was
i
thought
god
would
have
sent
me
a
nicer
doll
we
changed
it
for
a
nicer
doll
for
the
poor
elf
was
not
wicked
only
and
star
who
is
supposed
to
be
much
too
old
for
dolls
begged
for
the
despised
black
beauty
because
as
the
elf
maliciously
remarked
as
she
hugged
her
white
dolly
contentedly
that
black
thing
has
a
curly
head
just
like
star
the
habit
of
praying
about
everything
is
characteristic
of
the
elf
and
more
than
once
her
uninstructed
little
soul
has
grieved
over
the
strange
way
our
prayers
are
sometimes
answered
one
day
she
came
rushing
in
full
of
excitement
oh
may
i
go
and
be
examined
the
government
missie
ammal
is
going
to
examine
our
school
please
let
me
go
the
government
missie
ammal
a
great
celebrity
who
only
comes
round
once
a
year
was
staying
with
us
and
i
asked
her
if
the
child
might
have
the
joy
of
being
examined
even
though
she
had
not
had
nearly
her
year
at
school
she
agreed
for
the
sake
of
the
little
one
delight
for
an
indian
child
likes
nothing
better
than
a
fuss
of
any
kind
to
let
her
come
into
the
examination
room
and
take
her
examination
informally
we
knew
she
was
sure
of
a
pass
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
a
scout
came
flying
over
to
tell
us
the
awful
news
the
elf
had
failed
utterly
failed
and
she
was
so
ashamed
she
would
come
back
would
come
back
any
more
i
went
for
her
and
found
her
a
little
heap
of
sobs
and
tears
outside
the
schoolroom
i
gathered
her
up
in
my
arms
and
carried
her
home
and
tried
to
comfort
her
but
she
was
crushed
i
asked
god
so
earnestly
to
let
me
pass
and
i
did
pass
and
i
thought
he
had
listened
but
now
i
know
he
did
listen
at
all
i
was
puzzled
too
though
for
a
different
reason
i
knew
she
should
easily
have
passed
and
i
could
only
conclude
her
wild
excitement
had
made
her
nervous
for
with
many
tears
she
told
me
i
did
not
know
one
answer
not
even
one
and
again
she
came
back
to
the
first
and
sorest
oh
i
did
think
god
was
listening
and
he
was
listening
at
all
at
last
i
got
her
quieted
and
explained
by
means
of
a
rupee
and
an
anna
how
sometimes
god
gives
us
something
better
than
we
ask
for
we
ask
for
an
anna
and
he
gives
us
a
rupee
a
rupee
holds
sixteen
annas
she
grew
interested
then
my
passing
that
examination
was
the
anna
but
what
is
the
rupee
now
the
elf
as
you
may
have
observed
is
not
weighted
with
over
much
humility
so
i
told
her
i
thought
the
rupee
must
be
humility
she
considered
a
while
then
sliding
off
my
knee
she
knelt
down
and
said
with
the
utmost
gravity
and
purpose
o
god
i
did
not
want
that
kind
of
answer
but
i
do
want
it
now
give
me
the
rupee
of
humility
then
springing
up
with
eyes
dancing
with
mischief
next
time
i
fall
into
pride
you
will
say
where
is
that
rupee
when
the
school
examinations
were
over
and
the
missie
ammal
came
back
to
rest
i
asked
her
about
the
elf
she
really
did
very
badly
seemed
to
know
nothing
of
her
subjects
should
not
have
gone
in
poor
mite
it
suddenly
struck
me
to
ask
what
class
she
had
gone
into
the
first
said
the
missie
ammal
but
she
is
in
the
infants
then
we
understood
the
elf
had
only
been
at
school
for
a
few
months
and
had
just
finished
the
infant
standard
book
and
had
been
moved
into
the
first
a
day
or
two
before
as
the
teacher
felt
she
was
well
able
to
clear
the
first
course
in
the
next
six
months
and
take
her
examination
in
the
following
year
two
years
work
in
one
but
it
was
not
intended
she
should
go
in
for
the
government
examination
which
requires
a
certain
time
to
be
spent
in
preparation
so
when
in
the
confusion
of
the
arrangement
of
the
classes
she
stood
with
her
little
of
two
days
only
the
mistake
was
not
noticed
no
wonder
the
poor
elf
failed
we
never
told
her
the
reason
not
desiring
to
raise
fresh
questions
upon
the
mysterious
ways
of
providence
in
her
busy
little
brain
and
to
this
day
when
she
is
betrayed
into
pride
she
shakes
her
head
solemnly
at
herself
and
remembers
the
rupee
she
has
lately
been
staying
with
the
missie
ammals
my
very
particular
friends
as
she
calls
them
at
the
house
in
palamcottah
she
returned
to
us
full
of
matter
and
charged
with
a
new
idea
i
am
no
more
going
to
spend
my
pocket
money
upon
vanities
i
am
going
to
save
it
all
up
and
buy
a
this
treasure
is
a
fruitful
source
of
conversation
it
will
take
about
six
years
at
the
rate
of
one
farthing
a
week
to
save
enough
to
buy
exactly
the
kind
she
desires
i
do
want
a
bible
it
must
be
with
shining
all
down
the
leaves
on
the
outside
and
the
name
on
the
back
all
too
that
the
kind
of
bible
i
want
just
as
i
wrote
that
she
trotted
in
and
poured
three
in
small
change
upon
the
table
that
all
i
got
and
it
six
weeks
savings
six
years
is
a
long
long
time
she
confided
to
me
that
she
found
the
flesh
wanted
to
persuade
her
to
spend
these
three
on
cakes
it
is
the
flesh
is
it
that
feeling
you
get
inside
that
says
and
cakes
sweets
and
cakes
in
a
very
loud
voice
i
listened
to
it
for
a
little
and
then
i
wanted
those
sweets
and
cakes
so
i
said
to
myself
if
i
buy
them
they
will
all
be
gone
in
an
hour
but
if
i
buy
that
bible
it
will
last
for
years
and
years
so
i
would
not
listen
any
more
to
my
flesh
then
a
sudden
thought
struck
her
and
she
added
impressively
but
when
give
me
sweets
and
cakes
that
is
different
the
feeling
that
likes
them
is
not
then
it
is
only
when
i
tempted
to
spend
my
bible
money
on
them
this
was
a
point
i
was
intended
thoroughly
to
understand
sweets
and
cakes
were
not
to
be
confused
with
flesh
except
where
a
bible
was
concerned
she
seemed
relieved
when
i
agreed
with
her
that
such
things
might
perhaps
sometimes
be
innocently
enjoyed
and
with
a
sudden
and
rather
startling
change
of
subject
inquired
do
they
have
holidays
in
hell
chapter
xxi
deified
devilry
next
to
the
sacrificers
they
the
temple
women
are
the
most
important
persons
about
the
temple
that
a
temple
intended
as
a
place
of
worship
and
attended
by
hundreds
of
men
and
women
should
be
so
polluted
and
that
in
the
name
of
religion
is
almost
beyond
belief
and
that
indian
boys
should
grow
up
to
manhood
accustomed
to
see
immorality
shielded
in
these
temples
with
a
divine
cloak
makes
our
hearts
grow
sick
and
faint
fuller
excuse
the
title
of
this
chapter
i
can
write
no
other
sometimes
the
broad
smooth
levels
of
life
are
crossed
by
a
jagged
crack
rent
as
it
seems
by
an
outburst
of
the
fiery
force
below
we
find
ourselves
suddenly
close
upon
it
it
opens
right
at
our
very
feet
two
girls
came
to
see
us
sisters
but
tuned
to
different
keys
one
was
ordinary
enough
a
bright
girl
with
plenty
of
jewels
and
a
merry
contented
face
the
other
was
finer
grained
you
looked
at
her
as
you
would
look
at
the
covers
of
a
book
wondering
what
was
inside
both
were
married
neither
had
children
this
was
the
only
sorrow
the
younger
had
ever
had
and
it
did
not
seem
to
weigh
heavily
the
elder
looked
as
if
she
had
forgotten
how
to
smile
sometimes
when
the
other
laughed
her
eyes
would
light
for
a
moment
but
the
shadow
in
them
deepened
almost
before
the
light
had
come
great
soft
brown
eyes
full
of
the
dumb
look
that
animals
have
when
they
are
suffering
i
knew
her
story
and
understood
she
was
betrothed
as
a
baby
of
four
to
a
lad
considerably
older
a
lovable
boy
they
say
he
was
generous
and
frank
the
two
of
course
belonged
to
the
same
caste
the
vellalar
and
were
thoroughly
well
brought
up
in
south
india
no
ceremony
of
importance
is
considered
complete
without
the
presence
of
the
servants
of
the
gods
these
are
girls
and
women
belonging
to
the
temple
that
is
belonging
to
the
priests
of
the
temple
who
as
they
are
never
married
except
to
the
god
who
never
dies
can
never
become
widows
hence
the
auspiciousness
of
their
presence
at
betrothals
marriages
feasts
of
all
sorts
and
even
funerals
but
this
set
of
vellalars
had
as
a
clan
risen
above
the
popular
superstition
and
the
demoralising
presence
of
these
women
was
not
allowed
to
profane
either
the
betrothal
or
marriage
of
any
child
of
the
family
so
the
boy
and
girl
grew
up
as
unsullied
as
hindus
ever
are
they
knew
of
what
happened
in
other
homes
but
their
clan
was
a
large
one
and
they
found
their
society
in
it
and
did
not
come
across
others
much
shortly
before
his
marriage
the
boy
went
to
worship
in
the
great
temple
near
the
sea
he
had
heard
of
its
sanctity
all
his
life
and
as
a
little
lad
had
often
gone
with
his
parents
on
pilgrimage
there
but
now
he
went
to
worship
he
took
his
offering
and
went
he
went
again
and
again
all
that
he
saw
there
was
religion
all
that
he
did
was
religious
could
there
be
harm
in
it
he
was
married
his
little
bride
went
with
him
trustfully
she
knew
more
of
him
than
most
indian
brides
know
of
their
husbands
she
had
heard
he
was
loving
and
she
thought
he
would
be
kind
to
her
a
year
or
two
passed
and
the
child
face
had
a
look
in
it
which
even
the
careless
saw
but
she
never
spoke
about
anything
to
give
them
the
clue
to
it
she
went
to
stay
in
her
father
house
for
a
few
weeks
and
they
saw
the
change
but
she
would
not
speak
even
to
them
then
things
got
worse
the
girl
grew
thin
and
the
neighbours
talked
and
the
father
heard
and
understood
and
to
save
a
scandal
he
took
them
away
from
the
town
where
they
lived
and
made
every
effort
to
give
them
another
start
in
a
place
where
they
were
not
known
but
the
coils
of
that
snake
of
deified
sin
had
twisted
round
the
boy
body
and
soul
he
could
not
escape
from
it
they
moved
again
to
another
town
it
followed
him
there
for
a
temple
was
there
and
a
temple
means
then
the
devil
of
cruelty
seized
upon
him
he
would
drink
a
disgraceful
thing
in
his
caste
and
then
hold
his
little
wife
down
on
the
floor
and
stuff
a
bit
of
cloth
into
her
mouth
and
beat
her
and
kick
her
and
trample
upon
her
and
tear
the
jewels
out
of
her
ears
the
neighbours
saw
it
and
told
then
he
refused
to
bring
money
to
her
and
she
slowly
starved
quite
silent
still
till
at
last
hunger
broke
down
her
resolute
will
and
she
begged
the
neighbours
for
rice
and
he
did
more
but
it
can
not
be
told
how
often
one
stops
in
writing
whole
truth
can
never
be
she
is
only
a
girl
yet
in
years
at
least
in
suffering
oh
how
old
she
is
not
half
is
known
for
she
never
speaks
loyal
and
true
to
him
through
it
all
we
only
know
what
the
neighbours
know
and
what
her
silent
dark
eyes
tell
and
the
little
thin
face
and
hands
she
was
very
weary
and
ill
but
she
would
not
own
it
brave
little
soul
i
could
see
that
neuralgia
was
racking
her
head
and
every
limb
trembled
when
she
stood
up
but
what
made
it
so
pathetic
to
me
was
the
silence
with
which
she
bore
it
all
i
have
only
seen
her
once
before
and
now
she
is
going
far
away
with
her
husband
to
another
town
and
i
may
not
see
her
again
she
was
too
tired
to
listen
much
and
she
knows
so
little
not
nearly
enough
to
rest
her
soul
upon
she
can
not
read
so
it
is
useless
to
write
to
her
she
is
going
away
quite
out
of
our
reach
thank
god
not
out
of
his
we
watched
them
drive
off
in
the
bullock
cart
a
servant
walking
behind
the
little
pale
face
of
the
elder
girl
looked
out
at
the
open
end
of
the
cart
she
salaamed
as
they
drove
away
such
a
sweet
face
in
its
silent
strength
so
wondrously
gentle
yet
so
strong
strong
to
endure
do
you
wonder
i
call
this
sort
of
thing
a
look
deep
down
into
hell
do
you
wonder
we
burn
as
we
think
of
such
things
going
on
in
the
name
of
god
for
they
think
of
their
god
as
god
in
his
name
the
temples
are
built
and
endowed
and
provided
with
servants
to
do
devil
work
yes
sin
is
deified
here
and
the
shame
of
shames
is
that
some
englishmen
patronise
and
in
measure
support
the
iniquity
they
attend
entertainments
at
which
these
girls
are
present
to
sing
and
dance
and
see
nothing
disgraceful
in
so
doing
as
lately
as
when
the
indian
social
reformers
of
this
presidency
petitioned
two
notable
englishmen
to
discountenance
this
pernicious
practice
the
institution
of
slaves
of
the
gods
by
declining
to
attend
any
entertainment
at
which
they
are
invited
to
be
present
these
two
distinguished
men
representatives
of
our
queen
refused
to
take
action
in
the
matter
surely
this
is
a
strange
misuse
of
our
position
as
rulers
of
india
there
are
so
many
needs
everywhere
that
i
hardly
like
to
speak
of
our
own
but
we
do
need
someone
to
work
among
these
temple
women
and
girls
there
is
practically
nothing
being
done
for
them
because
it
is
impossible
for
any
of
us
to
work
among
them
and
others
at
the
same
time
the
nearest
home
to
which
we
could
send
such
a
one
is
four
hundred
miles
away
someone
is
needed
old
enough
to
have
had
experience
of
this
kind
of
work
and
yet
young
enough
to
learn
the
language
many
of
these
slaves
of
the
gods
were
bought
or
in
some
other
way
obtained
when
they
were
little
innocent
girls
and
they
can
not
be
held
responsible
for
the
terrible
life
to
which
they
are
doomed
by
the
law
of
the
hindu
religion
many
of
them
have
hardened
past
any
desire
to
be
other
than
they
are
but
sometimes
we
see
the
face
of
a
girl
who
looks
as
if
she
might
have
desire
if
only
she
had
a
chance
to
know
there
is
something
better
for
her
can
it
be
that
out
of
the
many
at
home
god
has
one
or
better
two
who
can
come
with
him
to
this
south
indian
district
to
do
what
must
always
be
awful
work
along
the
course
of
that
crack
if
she
comes
or
if
they
come
let
them
come
in
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
baptised
with
the
love
that
endures
this
then
is
one
look
into
hinduism
this
ghastly
whitened
sepulchre
within
which
are
dead
men
bones

behind
the
door
when
any
person
is
known
to
be
considering
the
new
religion
all
his
relations
and
acquaintances
rise
that
to
get
a
new
convert
is
like
pulling
out
the
of
a
live
judson
every
missionary
who
has
despaired
of
hitting
upon
an
illustration
vivid
enough
to
show
you
what
the
work
is
really
like
among
mohammedans
and
caste
hindus
will
appreciate
this
simile
after
our
return
from
dohnavur
we
found
that
the
villages
of
this
eastern
countryside
had
opened
again
and
the
people
were
willing
to
allow
us
to
teach
the
girls
and
women
for
two
months
this
lasted
and
then
three
boys
belonging
to
three
different
castes
became
known
as
inquirers
instantly
the
news
spread
through
all
the
villages
it
was
in
vain
we
told
them
we
had
never
once
even
seen
the
boys
had
in
no
way
influenced
them
the
people
held
to
it
that
personally
responsible
or
not
the
book
we
taught
to
the
girls
was
the
same
those
boys
had
read
an
undeniable
fact
that
its
poison
entered
through
the
eyes
ascended
to
the
brain
descended
to
the
heart
and
then
drew
the
reader
out
of
his
caste
and
his
religion
and
that
therefore
we
could
not
be
tolerated
in
the
streets
or
in
the
houses
any
more
and
so
we
were
turned
out
illustration
it
took
me
such
a
long
time
to
learn
to
draw
nicely
said
victory
when
she
saw
this
photo
i
used
to
go
to
the
brahman
street
every
morning
and
practise
it
there
a
design
is
drawn
with
a
piece
of
chalk
on
the
ground
in
front
of
every
house
each
morning
during
part
of
december
and
january
in
memory
of
a
goddess
who
used
to
amuse
herself
by
drawing
these
patterns
and
planting
flowers
in
them
all
sorts
of
geometrical
designs
are
drawn
by
the
women
and
children
and
the
regular
morning
drawing
is
part
of
the
day
work
in
one
village
where
many
of
the
relations
of
one
of
these
three
lads
live
the
tiger
growled
considerably
one
furious
old
dame
called
us
and
and
white
snakes
of
the
cobra
species
and
a
particular
genus
of
lizard
which
when
stamped
upon
merely
wriggles
and
can
not
be
persuaded
to
die
this
applied
to
our
persistence
in
evil
and
a
great
many
other
things
the
women
stood
out
in
the
street
in
defiant
groups
and
would
not
let
us
near
enough
to
explain
the
men
sat
on
the
verandah
fronts
and
smiled
blandly
superior
to
the
childish
nonsense
the
women
talked
but
they
did
not
interfere
villages
like
this
and
old
india
is
made
up
of
such
villages
are
far
removed
from
the
influence
of
the
few
enlightened
centres
which
exist
madras
is
only
a
name
to
them
distant
four
hundred
miles
or
so
a
place
where
caste
notions
are
very
lax
and
people
are
mixed
up
and
jumbled
together
in
a
most
unbecoming
way
education
or
learning
as
they
call
it
they
consider
an
excellent
thing
for
boys
who
want
to
come
to
the
front
and
earn
money
and
grow
rich
but
for
girls
what
possible
use
is
it
can
they
pass
examinations
and
get
into
government
employ
if
you
answered
this
question
you
would
only
disgust
them
then
there
is
a
latent
feeling
common
enough
in
these
old
caste
families
that
it
is
rather
for
their
women
to
know
too
much
it
may
be
all
very
well
for
those
who
have
no
pretensions
to
greatness
they
may
need
a
ladder
by
which
to
climb
up
the
social
scale
but
we
who
are
already
at
the
top
what
do
we
want
with
it
have
not
our
daughters
got
their
this
feeling
is
passing
away
in
the
towns
but
the
villages
hold
out
longer
in
that
particular
village
we
had
some
dear
little
girls
who
were
getting
very
keen
and
it
was
so
hard
to
move
out
and
leave
the
field
to
the
devil
as
undisputed
victor
thereon
and
i
sent
one
of
our
workers
to
try
again
she
is
a
plucky
little
soul
but
even
she
had
to
beat
a
retreat
they
will
have
none
of
us
we
went
on
that
day
to
a
village
where
they
had
listened
splendidly
only
a
week
before
they
had
no
time
it
was
the
busy
season
then
to
a
town
farther
on
but
it
was
quite
impracticable
so
we
went
to
our
friend
the
dear
old
evangelist
there
the
blind
old
man
he
and
his
wife
are
lights
in
that
dark
town
it
is
so
refreshing
to
spend
half
an
hour
with
two
genuine
good
old
christians
after
a
tug
of
war
with
the
heathen
they
have
no
idea
they
are
helping
you
but
they
are
and
you
return
home
ever
so
much
the
happier
for
the
sight
of
them
as
we
came
home
we
were
almost
mobbed
in
the
old
days
mobs
there
were
of
common
occurrence
it
is
a
rough
market
town
and
the
people
after
the
first
converts
came
used
to
hoot
us
through
the
streets
and
throw
handfuls
of
sand
at
us
and
shower
ashes
on
our
hair
in
theory
i
like
this
very
much
but
in
practice
not
at
all
the
yellings
of
the
crowd
men
chiefly
are
not
polite
the
yelpings
of
the
dogs
set
on
by
sympathetic
spectators
the
sickening
blaze
of
the
sun
and
the
reflected
glare
from
the
houses
the
blinding
dust
in
your
eyes
and
the
queer
feel
of
ashes
down
your
neck
above
all
the
sense
that
this
sort
of
thing
does
no
manner
of
good
for
it
is
not
persecution
nothing
so
heroic
and
it
will
not
end
in
martyrdom
no
such
honours
come
our
way
all
this
row
and
all
these
feelings
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
combine
to
make
mobbing
less
interesting
than
might
be
expected
you
hold
on
and
look
up
for
patience
and
good
nature
and
such
like
common
graces
and
you
pray
that
you
may
not
be
down
with
fever
for
fever
has
a
way
of
stopping
work
and
you
get
out
of
it
all
as
quickly
as
you
can
without
showing
undue
hurry
and
then
though
little
they
know
it
you
go
and
get
a
fresh
baptism
of
love
for
them
all
but
how
delighted
one
would
be
to
go
through
such
unromantic
trifles
every
hour
of
every
day
if
only
at
the
end
one
could
get
into
the
hearts
and
the
homes
of
the
people
as
it
is
just
now
our
grief
is
that
we
can
not
we
know
of
several
who
want
us
and
we
are
shut
out
from
them
one
is
a
young
wife
who
saw
us
one
day
by
the
waterside
and
asked
us
to
come
and
teach
her
for
doing
this
she
was
publicly
beaten
that
evening
in
the
open
street
by
a
man
before
men
so
for
fear
of
what
they
would
do
to
her
we
dare
not
go
near
the
house
another
is
a
widow
who
has
spent
all
her
fortune
in
building
a
for
the
brahmans
and
who
has
not
found
rest
she
listened
once
too
earnestly
she
has
not
been
allowed
to
listen
again
oh
how
that
tiger
bites
next
door
to
her
is
a
child
we
have
prayed
for
for
three
years
she
was
a
loving
clinging
child
when
i
knew
her
then
little
gold
with
the
earnest
eyes
that
last
day
i
saw
her
she
put
her
hands
into
mine
caring
nothing
for
defilement
are
we
not
one
caste
she
said
i
did
not
know
it
was
the
last
time
i
should
see
her
that
the
next
time
when
i
spoke
to
her
i
should
only
see
her
shadow
in
the
dark
and
one
wishes
now
one
had
known
how
much
one
would
have
said
but
the
house
was
open
then
and
all
the
houses
were
then
the
first
girl
convert
after
bravely
witnessing
at
home
took
her
stand
as
a
christian
her
caste
people
burned
down
the
little
mission
school
a
boys
school
and
chalked
up
their
sentiments
on
the
charred
walls
they
burned
down
the
house
and
a
school
sixteen
miles
away
and
the
countryside
closed
every
town
and
village
in
it
as
if
the
whole
were
a
single
door
with
the
devil
on
the
other
side
of
it
but
some
of
the
girls
behind
the
door
managed
to
send
us
messages
gold
was
one
of
these
she
wanted
so
much
to
see
us
again
she
begged
us
to
come
and
try
we
tried
we
met
the
mother
outside
and
asked
her
to
let
us
come
she
is
a
hard
old
woman
with
eyes
like
bits
of
black
ice
set
deep
in
her
head
she
froze
us
and
refused
afterwards
we
heard
what
the
child
punishment
was
they
took
her
down
to
the
water
and
led
her
in
she
stood
trembling
waist
deep
not
knowing
what
they
meant
to
do
then
they
held
her
head
under
the
water
till
she
made
some
sign
to
show
she
would
give
in
they
released
her
then
rubbed
ashes
on
her
brow
sign
of
recantation
and
they
led
her
back
sobbing
poor
little
girl
she
is
not
made
of
martyr
stuff
she
was
only
miserable
for
some
months
we
saw
nothing
of
her
we
used
to
go
to
the
next
house
and
persuade
the
people
to
let
us
sing
to
them
we
sang
for
gold
but
we
never
knew
if
she
heard
one
evening
as
two
of
us
came
home
late
from
work
a
woman
passed
us
and
said
hurriedly
to
me
come
come
quickly
and
alone
it
is
gold
who
calls
you
come
i
followed
her
to
the
house
i
am
gold
married
sister
she
explained
sit
down
outside
in
the
verandah
near
the
door
and
wait
till
the
child
comes
out
then
she
went
in
and
i
sat
still
and
waited
those
minutes
were
like
what
was
happening
inside
but
apparently
the
mother
was
away
for
soon
the
door
opened
softly
and
a
shadow
flitted
out
and
i
knew
it
must
be
gold
she
dropped
on
her
knees
on
the
little
narrow
verandah
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
crept
along
to
its
farther
end
and
then
i
could
only
distinguish
a
dark
shape
in
the
dark
for
perhaps
five
minutes
no
one
came
except
the
sister
who
stood
at
the
door
and
watched
and
for
those
five
minutes
one
was
free
to
speak
as
freely
as
one
could
speak
to
a
shape
which
one
could
barely
see
and
which
showed
no
sign
and
spoke
no
word
five
whole
minutes
how
one
valued
every
moment
of
them
then
a
man
came
and
sat
down
on
the
verandah
he
must
have
been
a
relative
for
he
did
not
mean
to
go
i
wished
he
would
it
was
impossible
to
talk
past
him
to
her
without
letting
him
know
she
was
there
so
one
had
to
talk
to
him
but
for
her
and
even
this
could
not
last
long
dusk
here
soon
is
dark
we
had
to
go
as
we
went
we
looked
back
and
saw
him
still
keeping
his
unconscious
guard
over
the
child
in
her
there
are
no
secrets
in
india
it
was
known
that
we
had
been
there
and
that
stern
old
mother
punished
her
child
but
how
we
never
knew
if
any
blame
us
for
going
at
all
let
it
be
remembered
that
one
of
christ
little
ones
was
thirsty
and
she
held
out
her
hand
for
a
cup
of
cold
water
we
could
not
have
left
that
hand
empty
i
think
after
that
we
heard
nothing
for
a
year
then
an
old
man
whom
we
had
helped
and
who
hoped
we
intended
to
help
him
more
came
one
evening
to
tell
us
he
meant
to
set
gold
free
it
was
all
to
be
secretly
done
and
it
was
to
be
done
that
night
we
told
him
we
could
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
plan
and
we
explained
to
him
why
but
he
objected
what
folly
is
this
i
thought
you
christians
helped
poor
girls
and
this
one
certainly
wants
to
come
she
is
of
age
this
is
the
time
if
you
wait
you
will
never
get
her
at
all
we
knew
this
was
more
than
probable
to
refuse
his
help
was
like
turning
the
key
and
locking
her
body
and
soul
into
prison
an
awful
thought
to
me
as
i
remembered
treasure
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
and
afterwards
when
we
heard
who
he
was
and
what
his
real
intentions
were
we
were
thankful
we
had
done
it
he
looked
at
us
curiously
as
he
went
as
if
our
view
of
things
struck
him
as
strange
and
he
begged
us
never
to
breathe
a
word
of
what
he
had
said
we
never
did
but
it
somehow
oozed
out
and
soon
after
that
he
sickened
and
very
suddenly
died
his
body
was
burnt
within
two
hours
are
rare
in
india
another
year
passed
in
silence
as
to
gold
how
often
we
went
down
the
street
and
looked
across
at
her
home
with
its
door
almost
always
shut
and
that
mother
on
guard
we
used
to
see
her
going
about
never
far
from
the
house
when
we
saw
her
we
salaamed
then
she
would
glare
at
us
grimly
and
turn
her
back
on
us
once
the
whole
family
went
to
a
festival
but
the
girl
of
course
was
bundled
in
and
out
of
a
covered
cart
and
seen
by
no
one
not
even
the
neighbours
there
was
talk
of
a
marriage
for
her
most
girls
of
her
caste
are
married
much
younger
but
to
our
relief
this
fell
through
and
once
one
of
us
saw
her
for
a
moment
and
she
still
seemed
to
care
to
hear
though
she
was
far
too
cowed
by
this
time
to
show
it
then
we
heard
a
rumour
that
a
girl
from
the
lake
village
had
been
seen
by
some
of
our
christians
in
a
wood
near
a
village
five
miles
distant
these
christians
are
very
and
keen
about
converts
and
they
managed
to
discover
that
the
girl
in
the
wood
had
some
thought
of
being
a
christian
and
that
her
being
there
had
some
connection
with
this
so
they
told
us
at
once
the
description
fitted
gold
but
we
could
not
account
for
a
girl
of
her
caste
being
seen
in
a
wood
she
was
always
kept
in
seclusion
at
last
we
found
out
the
truth
she
had
shown
some
sign
of
a
lingering
love
for
christ
and
her
mother
had
taken
her
to
a
famous
brahman
ascetic
who
lived
in
that
wood
and
there
together
mother
and
daughter
stayed
in
a
hut
near
the
hermit
hut
and
for
three
days
he
had
devoted
himself
to
confuse
and
confound
her
and
finally
he
succeeded
and
reported
her
convinced
illustration
this
is
the
tangible
door
outside
of
which
we
so
often
stand
on
the
stone
step
and
knock
and
hear
voices
from
within
call
everyone
is
out
the
are
the
of
the
power
that
keeps
the
door
shut
once
a
year
every
door
and
the
lintel
of
every
window
and
sometimes
the
walls
are
marked
like
this
that
evening
just
before
dark
the
god
comes
round
they
say
and
looks
for
his
mark
on
the
door
and
seeing
it
blesses
all
in
the
house
if
there
is
no
mark
he
leaves
a
curse
this
is
the
devil
south
indian
parody
on
the
passover
we
heard
all
this
and
sorrowed
and
wondered
how
it
was
done
we
never
heard
all
but
we
heard
one
delusion
they
practised
upon
her
appealing
as
they
so
often
do
to
the
oriental
imagination
which
finds
such
solid
satisfaction
in
the
supernatural
nothing
is
so
convincing
as
a
vision
or
a
dream
so
a
vision
appeared
before
her
an
incarnation
they
told
her
of
siva
in
the
form
of
christ
siva
and
christ
then
were
one
as
they
had
so
often
assured
her
one
identity
under
two
names
hinduism
is
crammed
with
incarnations
this
presented
no
difficulty
like
the
old
monk
the
bewildered
child
looked
for
the
print
of
the
nails
and
the
spear
yes
they
were
there
marked
in
hands
and
foot
and
side
it
must
be
hard
to
distrust
one
own
mother
gold
still
trusted
hers
listen
said
the
mother
and
the
vision
spoke
if
the
speech
of
the
christians
is
true
i
will
return
within
days
if
the
speech
of
the
hindus
is
true
i
will
not
return
then
hour
by
hour
for
those
days
they
wove
their
webs
about
her
webs
of
wonderful
sophistry
which
have
entangled
keener
brains
than
hers
she
was
entangled
the
days
did
their
work
she
yielded
her
will
on
the
so
the
mother
and
the
brahman
won
these
letters
are
written
as
you
know
with
a
definite
purpose
we
try
to
show
you
what
goes
on
behind
the
door
the
very
door
of
the
photograph

of

the

seeing
behind
you
may
understand
how
fiercely

there
is
one
thing
that
refreshes
my

above
all

it
is
that
i
shall
behold
the

gloriously
triumphant
at

things
martyn
partly
founded
upon
a
tradition
mentioned
by

according
to
which
at
the
hour
of
the
saviour
agony
a
cry
of
pan
is
dead
swept
across
the
waves
in
the
hearing
of
certain
mariners
and
the
oracles
ceased
so
reads
the
to
one
of
elizabeth
barrett
browning
poems
we
look
up
a
classical
dictionary
and
find
the
legend
there
this
was
readily
believed
by
the
emperor
and
the
astrologers
were
consulted
but
they
were
unable
to
explain
the
meaning
of
so
supernatural
a
voice
pan
and
with
him
all
the
false
gods
of
the
old
world
die
in
the
day
of

according

nor

secure

a

here
these

do
lie
pan
pan

yet
is
he
dead
quite
dead
night
moonless
and
hot
our
camp
is
pitched
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
we
are
asleep
suddenly
there
is
what
sounds
like
an
explosion
just
outside
then
another
and
another
such
a
bursting
bang
then
a
and
i
am
out
of
bed
standing
out
on
the
sand
and
for
a
moment
i
am
sure
the
kitchen
tent
is
on
fire
then
it
dawns
on
me
in
the
slow
way
things
dawn
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
is
only
fireworks
being
let
off
by
the
festival
people
only
fireworks
but
i
stand
and
look
and
in
the
darkness
everything
seems
much
bigger
than
it
is
and
much
more
awful
there
is
the
gleaming
of
water
lit
by
the
fires
of
the
crowd
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
there
are
torches
waving
uncertainly
in
and
out
of
the
vast
black
mass
black
even
in
the
black
of
night
where
the
people
are
there
is
the
sudden
burst
and
of
the
rockets
as
they
rush
up
into
the
night
and
fall
in
showers
of
colours
on
the
black
mass
and
the
water
and
there
is
the
hoarse
roar
of
many
voices
mingled
with
the
bleat
of
many
goats
i
stand
and
look
and
know
what
is
going
on
they
are
killing
those
goats
thirty
thousand
of
them
killing
them
now
is
pan
dead
morning
blazing
sun
relentless
sun
showing
up
all
that
is
going
on
we
are
crossing
the
in
our
cart
do
look
says
my
comrade
and
i
look
the
other
way
then
we
separate
she
goes
among
the
crowds
in
the
river
bed
where
the
sun
is
hottest
and
the
air
most
polluted
and
the
scenes
on
every
side
most
sickening
and
i
go
up
the
bank
among
the
people
we
have
each
a
tamil
sister
with
us
and
farther
down
the
stream
another
little
group
of
three
is
at
work
in
all
seven
to
tens
of
thousands
but
we
hope
more
will
come
later
on
we
have
arranged
to
meet
at
the
cart
at
about
ten
the
is
directed
to
work
his
way
up
to
a
big
banyan
tree
near
the
temple
he
struggles
up
through
a
tangle
of
carts
and
finds
a
slanting
on
the
edge
of
the
shade
of
the
tree
all
the
way
up
the
bank
they
are
killing
and
skinning
their
goats
you
look
to
the
right
and
put
your
hands
over
your
eyes
you
look
to
the
left
and
do
it
again
you
look
straight
in
front
and
see
an
extended
skinned
victim
hung
from
the
branch
of
a
tree
every
hanging
rootlet
of
the
great
banyan
tree
is
hung
with
horrors
all
dead
most
mercifully
but
horrible
still
we
had
thought
the
killing
over
or
we
should
hardly
have
ventured
to
come
but
these
who
are
busy
are
late
arrivals
one
tells
oneself
over
and
over
again
that
a
headless
creature
can
not
possibly
feel
but
it
looks
as
if
it
felt
it
goes
on
moving
we
look
away
and
we
go
on
trying
to
get
out
of
it
but
thirty
thousand
goats
it
takes
a
long
time
to
get
out
of
it
we
see
groups
of
little
children
watching
the
process
delightedly
there
is
no
intentional
cruelty
for
the
god
will
not
accept
the
sacrifice
unless
the
head
is
severed
by
a
single
stroke
a
great
relief
to
me
but
it
is
most
disgusting
and
demoralising
and
to
think
that
these
children
are
being
taught
to
connect
it
with
religion
with
me
is
one
who
used
to
enjoy
it
all
she
tells
me
how
she
twisted
the
fowls
heads
off
with
her
own
hands
i
look
at
the
fine
little
brown
hands
such
loving
little
hands
and
i
can
hardly
believe
it
you
do
such
a
thing
i
say
and
she
says
yes
when
the
day
came
round
to
sacrifice
to
our
family
divinity
my
little
brother
held
the
goat
head
while
my
father
struck
it
off
and
i
twisted
the
chickens
heads
it
was
my
pleasure
we
go
up
along
the
bank
still
those
crowds
and
those
goats
killed
or
being
killed
we
can
not
get
away
from
them
at
last
we
reach
a
tree
partly
unoccupied
but
it
is
leafless
alas
on
one
side
of
it
a
family
party
is
cheerfully
feeding
behind
a
shelter
of
mats
a
little
lower
down
some
pariahs
are
haggling
over
less
polite
portions
of
the
goat
economy
they
wrap
up
the
stringy
things
in
leaves
and
tuck
them
into
a
fold
of
their
seeleys
at
our
feet
a
small
boy
plays
with
the
head
we
sit
down
in
the
band
of
shade
cast
by
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
grateful
for
so
much
shelter
invite
the
to
listen
while
we
sing
some
listen
an
old
hag
who
is
chaperoning
a
bright
young
wife
draws
the
girl
towards
us
and
sits
down
she
has
never
heard
a
word
of
our
doctrine
before
and
neither
has
the
girl
then
some
boys
come
full
of
mischief
and
fun
and
threaten
an
upset
so
we
pick
out
the
rowdiest
of
them
and
suggest
he
should
keep
order
which
he
does
with
great
alacrity
swinging
a
switch
most
vigorously
at
anyone
likely
to
interfere
with
the
welfare
of
the
meeting
my
little
companion
speaks
to
them
as
only
one
who
was
once
where
they
are
ever
can
i
listen
to
her
and
long
for
the
flow
at
her
command
do
you
not
do
this
and
this
she
says
naming
the
very
things
they
do
and
do
you
say
so
and
so
they
stare
and
then
oh
she
was
once
one
of
us
what
is
her
caste
when
did
she
come
where
are
her
father
and
mother
what
is
her
village
is
she
not
married
why
is
she
not
and
where
are
her
jewels
above
all
everyone
asks
it
at
once
what
is
her
caste
and
they
guess
it
and
probably
guess
right
you
can
have
no
idea
unless
you
have
worked
among
them
how
difficult
it
is
to
get
a
heathen
woman
to
listen
with
full
attention
for
ten
consecutive
minutes
they
are
easily
distracted
and
there
are
so
many
things
to
distract
them
they
do
listen
very
well
they
are
tired
too
they
say
the
wild
rough
night
has
done
its
work
yesterday
it
was
different
we
got
good
listeners
being
women
and
alone
in
such
a
crowd
of
idolaters
we
do
not
attempt
an
meeting
but
just
sit
quietly
where
we
can
and
talk
to
any
we
can
persuade
to
sit
down
beside
us
hindus
are
safer
far
than
mohammedans
they
are
very
seldom
rude
but
we
know
enough
of
what
is
going
on
to
make
us
keep
clear
of
all
men
if
we
can
they
would
not
say
anything
much
to
us
but
they
might
say
a
good
deal
to
each
other
which
is
better
left
unsaid
by
the
time
we
have
gathered
and
held
and
then
had
to
let
go
three
or
four
of
such
little
groups
it
is
breakfast
time
and
we
want
our
breakfast
badly
so
we
press
through
the
crowd
diving
under
mat
sheds
and
among
unspeakable
messes
heaps
of
skins
on
either
side
and
one
hardly
knows
what
under
every
foot
of
sand
for
the
people
bury
the
débris
lightly
throwing
a
handful
of
sand
on
the
worst
and
the
sun
does
the
rest
of
the
sanitation
it
is
rather
horrible
at
last
we
reach
the
cart
tilted
sideways
on
the
bank
and
get
through
our
breakfast
somehow
and
rest
for
a
few
blissful
minutes
in
most
uncomfortable
positions
before
plunging
again
into
that
sea
of
sun
and
sand
and
animals
human
and
otherwise
and
then
we
part
arranging
to
meet
when
we
can
not
go
on
any
more
is
pan
dead
noon
and
hotter
far
hotter
than
ever
oh
how
the
people
throng
and
push
and
kill
and
eat
and
bury
remains
how
can
they
enjoy
it
so
what
can
be
the
pleasure
in
it
we
find
our
way
back
to
that
ribbon
of
shade
it
is
a
narrower
ribbon
now
because
the
sun
riding
overhead
throws
the
shadow
of
a
single
bough
instead
of
the
broader
trunk
but
such
as
it
is
we
are
glad
of
it
and
again
we
gather
little
groups
and
talk
to
them
and
sing
some
beautiful
girls
pass
us
close
the
only
girls
to
be
seen
anywhere
only
little
children
and
wives
come
here
no
good
unmarried
girls
one
of
the
group
is
dressed
in
white
but
most
are
in
vivid
purples
and
crimsons
the
girl
in
white
has
a
weary
look
the
work
of
the
night
again
but
most
of
the
sisterhood
are
indoors
in
the
evening
we
shall
see
more
of
them
scattered
among
the
people
doing
their
terrible
master
work
these
pass
us
without
speaking
and
mingle
in
the
crowd
after
an
hour
in
the
band
of
shade
we
slowly
climb
the
bank
again
and
find
ourselves
among
the
potters
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
every
family
buys
a
pot
and
perhaps
two
or
three
of
different
sizes
so
the
potters
drive
a
brisk
trade
and
have
no
leisure
to
listen
to
us
it
is
getting
very
much
hotter
now
for
the
burning
sand
and
the
thousands
of
fires
radiate
up
through
the
air
heated
already
stiflingly
we
think
of
our
comrades
down
in
the
river
bed
reeking
with
odours
of
killing
and
cooking
a
combination
of
abominations
unimagined
by
me
before
we
look
down
upon
a
collection
of
cart
tops
the
mat
covers
are
massed
in
brown
patches
all
over
the
sand
and
the
moving
crowds
are
between
we
do
not
see
the
others
have
they
found
it
as
difficult
as
we
find
it
we
wonder
to
get
any
disengaged
enough
to
want
to
listen
at
last
we
reach
the
long
stone
aisle
leading
to
the
temple
on
either
side
there
are
lines
of
booths
open
to
the
air
but
shaded
from
the
sun
and
we
persuade
a
friendly
to
let
us
creep
into
her
shelter
she
is
cooking
cakes
on
the
ground
she
lets
us
into
an
empty
corner
facing
the
passing
crowds
and
one
or
two
and
then
two
or
three
and
so
on
till
we
have
quite
a
group
stop
as
they
pass
and
squat
down
in
the
shade
and
listen
for
a
little
then
an
old
lady
with
a
keen
old
face
buys
a
gospel
portion
at
half
price
and
folds
it
carefully
in
a
corner
of
her
seeley
two
or
three
others
buy
gospels
and
all
of
them
want
tracts
the
gets
a
bit
restive
at
this
rivalry
of
wares
we
spend
our
farthings
proceeds
of
our
sales
on
her
cakes
and
she
is
mollified
but
some
new
attraction
in
the
gallery
leading
to
the
temple
disperses
our
little
audience
to
collect
it
round
itself
the
old
woman
explains
that
the
gospel
she
has
bought
is
for
her
grandson
a
scholar
she
tells
us
aged
five
and
moves
off
to
see
the
new
show
and
we
move
off
with
her
there
in
the
first
stall
between
the
double
row
of
pillars
a
man
is
standing
on
a
form
whirling
a
sort
of
crackling
rattle
high
above
his
head
in
the
next
another
is
yelling
to
call
attention
to
his
clocks
there
they
are
ranged
tier
upon
tier
regular
english
clocks
ticking
away
as
a
small
child
remarks
as
if
they
were
alive
then
come
stalls
of
pottery
and
brass
vessels
and
jewellery
and
basket
work
and
cutlery
and
bangles
in
wheelbarrow
loads
and
medicines
and
mats
and
money
boxes
and
anything
and
everything
of
every
description
obtainable
here
in
each
stall
is
a
occasionally
one
like
the
man
exerts
himself
to
sell
his
goods
more
often
he
lazes
in
true
oriental
fashion
and
sells
or
not
as
fortune
decides
for
him
equally
satisfied
with
either
decree
how
indian
shopkeepers
live
at
all
is
always
a
puzzle
to
me
they
hardly
ever
seem
to
do
anything
but
on
and
on
in
disorderly
but
perfectly
streams
the
people
are
passing
up
to
the
temple
or
coming
down
from
worship
there
all
who
come
down
have
their
foreheads
smeared
with
white
ashes
even
here
there
are
goats
they
are
being
pulled
poor
reluctant
beasts
right
to
the
steps
of
the
shrine
there
to
be
dedicated
to
the
god
within
then
they
will
be
dragged
still
reluctant
round
the
temple
walls
outside
then
decapitated
i
watch
a
baby
tug
a
goat
by
a
rope
tied
round
its
neck
the
goat
has
horns
and
i
expect
every
moment
to
see
the
baby
gored
but
it
never
seems
to
enter
into
the
goat
head
to
do
anything
so
aggressive
it
tugs
however
and
the
baby
tugs
till
a
comes
to
the
assistance
and
all
three
struggle
up
to
the
shrine
we
are
standing
now
in
an
empty
stall
just
a
little
out
of
the
crush
next
door
is
an
assortment
of
small
tamil
booklets
in
marvellous
colours
orange
and
green
predominating
there
is
an
empty
barrel
rolled
into
the
corner
and
we
sit
down
on
it
and
begin
to
read
from
our
book
this
causes
a
diversion
in
the
flow
of
the
stream
and
we
get
another
chance
but
it
grows
hotter
and
hotter
and
we
get
so
thirsty
and
long
for
a
drink
of
cocoanut
water
it
is
always
safe
to
drink
that
no
cocoanuts
are
available
though
and
we
have
no
money
then
a
man
selling
native
comes
working
his
way
in
and
out
of
the
press
and
we
become
conscious
that
of
all
things
in
the
world
the
thing
we
yearn
for
most
is
a
drink
of
the
man
stops
in
front
of
our
stall
pours
out
a
cupful
of
that
precious
liquid
and
seeing
the
thirst
in
our
eyes
i
suppose
beseeches
us
to
drink
we
explain
our
penniless
plight
buy
our
books
and
we
buy
your
but
he
does
not
want
our
books
then
we
wish
we
had
not
squandered
our
farthings
on
those
impossible
cakes
the
man
proposes
he
should
trust
us
for
the
money
he
is
sure
to
come
across
us
again
he
is
a
man
but
debt
is
a
sin
it
is
not
likely
we
shall
see
him
again
the
man
considers
he
is
poor
but
we
are
thirsty
to
give
drink
to
the
thirsty
is
an
act
of
merit
acts
of
merit
come
in
useful
both
in
this
world
and
the
next
he
pours
out
a
cupful
of
he
had
poured
the
first
one
back
when
we
showed
our
empty
hands
we
hesitate
he
is
poor
but
we
are
so
very
thirsty
the
next
reads
our
hearts
throws
a
halfpenny
to
the
man
there
he
says
drink
to
the
limit
of
your
capacity
and
we
drink
it
is
a
comical
feeling
to
be
beholden
to
a
seller
of
small
tamil
literature
of
questionable
description
but
we
really
are
past
drawing
nice
distinctions
never
was
so
good
we
get
through
three
brass
between
us
and
feel
life
worth
living
again
we
give
the
good
bookseller
plenty
of
books
to
cover
his
halfpenny
and
to
gratify
us
he
accepts
them
but
as
he
does
not
really
require
them
doubtless
the
merit
he
has
acquired
is
counted
as
undiminished
and
we
part
most
excellent
friends
and
now
the
crowd
streaming
up
to
the
temple
gets
denser
every
moment
every
conceivable
phase
of
devotion
is
represented
here
every
conceivable
type
of
worshipper
too
some
are
reverent
some
are
rampant
some
are
earnest
some
are
careless
awestruck
excited
but
more
usually
perfectly
frivolous
on
and
on
they
stream
i
leave
my
tamil
sister
safely
with
two
others
at
the
cart
but
the
comrade
whom
i
am
to
meet
again
at
that
same
cart
some
time
has
not
turned
up
so
i
go
off
alone
for
another
try
drawn
by
the
sight
of
that
stream
and
i
let
myself
drift
along
with
it
and
am
caught
in
it
and
carried
up
up
till
i
am
within
the
temple
wall
one
of
a
stream
of
men
and
women
streaming
up
to
the
shrine
we
reach
it
at
last
it
is
dark
i
can
just
see
an
iron
grating
set
in
darkness
with
a
light
somewhere
behind
and
there
standing
on
the
very
steps
of
satan
seat
there
is
a
single
minute
chance
to
witness
for
christ
the
people
are
all
on
their
faces
in
the
dust
and
the
crush
and
for
that
single
minute
they
listen
amazed
at
hearing
any
such
voice
in
here
but
it
would
not
do
to
stay
and
before
they
have
time
to
make
up
their
minds
what
to
make
of
it
i
am
caught
in
another
stream
flowing
round
to
the
right
and
find
myself
in
a
quieter
place
a
sort
of
eddy
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
whirlpool
where
the
worship
is
less
intense
and
very
many
women
are
sitting
gossiping
there
sitting
on
the
ground
beside
one
of
the
smaller
shrines
which
cluster
round
the
greater
i
have
such
a
chance
as
i
never
expected
to
get
for
the
women
and
children
are
so
astonished
to
see
a
white
face
in
here
that
they
throw
all
restraint
to
the
winds
and
crowd
round
me
asking
questions
about
how
i
got
in
for
indian
temples
are
sacred
to
indians
no
alien
may
pass
within
the
walls
to
the
centre
of
the
shrine
moreover
we
never
go
to
the
temples
to
see
the
parts
that
are
open
to
view
because
we
know
the
such
is
to
the
hindus
all
this
the
women
know
for
everything
a
missionary
does
or
does
not
do
is
observed
by
these
observant
people
and
commented
on
in
private
now
as
they
gather
round
me
i
tell
them
why
i
have
come
how
i
got
in
i
can
not
explain
unless
it
was
as
the
women
declared
that
being
in
a
seeley
one
was
not
conspicuous
and
they
take
me
into
confidence
and
tell
me
the
truth
about
themselves
which
is
the
last
thing
they
usually
tell
and
strikes
me
as
strange
and
they
listen
splendidly
and
would
listen
as
long
as
i
would
stay
but
it
is
not
wise
to
stay
too
long
and
i
get
into
the
stream
again
which
all
this
time
has
been
pouring
round
the
inner
block
of
the
temple
and
am
carried
round
with
it
as
it
pours
back
and
out
and
as
i
pass
out
still
in
that
stream
i
notice
that
the
temple
area
is
crowded
with
all
kinds
of
merchandise
stalls
of
all
sorts
just
as
outside
vendors
of
everything
from
mud
pots
up
to
jewels
are
roaming
over
the
place
crying
their
wares
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
market
and
right
in
the
middle
of
them
the
worship
goes
on
at
the
different
shrines
and
before
the
different
idols
there
it
is
market
and
temple
as
in
the
days
of
our
lord
neither
seems
to
interfere
with
the
other
no
one
seems
to
see
anything
incongruous
in
the
sight
of
a
man
prostrated
before
a
stone
set
at
the
back
of
a
heap
of
glass
bangles
and
when
someone
drops
suddenly
and
sometimes
reverently
in
front
of
a
stall
of
coils
of
oily
cakes
no
one
sees
anything
extraordinary
in
it
they
know
there
is
a
god
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
cakes
on
and
out
through
the
aisle
with
its
hundred
pillars
all
stone
stone
paving
pillars
roof
on
and
out
into
the
glare
and
the
sight
of
the
goats
again
but
one
hardly
sees
them
now
for
between
them
and
eyes
seem
to
come
the
things
one
saw
inside
those
men
and
women
hundreds
of
them
worshipping
that
which
is
not
god
is
pan
dead
pan
is
dead
oh
pan
is
dead
for
clearer
than
the
sight
of
that
idolatrous
crowd
i
saw
this
i
had
seen
it
inside
those
temple
walls
a
pile
of
old
dead
gods
they
were
bundled
away
in
a
corner
behind
the
central
shrine
stone
gods
mere
headless
stumps
wooden
gods
with
limbs
lopped
off
clay
gods
mere
lumps
of
mud
mutilated
and
neglected
old
gods
oh
the
worship
once
offered
to
those
broken
battered
things
no
one
worships
them
now
for
full
five
minutes
i
had
sat
and
looked
at
them
gods
bereavëd
gods
belated
with
your
purples
rent
asunder
gods
discrowned
and
desecrated
disinherited
of
thunder
there
were
withered
wreaths
lying
at
the
feet
of
some
of
the
idols
near
there
were
fresh
wreaths
round
the
necks
of
others
there
were
no
wreaths
in
this
corner
of
dead
gods
i
looked
and
looked
and
looked
again
oh
there
was
prophecy
in
it
and
as
i
came
out
among
the
living
people
the
sight
of
that
graveyard
of
dead
gods
was
ever
with
me
and
the
god
prophetess
sang
sang
itself
through
and
through
me
pan
is
dead
dead
was
the
hour
when
one
in
sion
hung
for
love
sake
on
a
cross
when
his
brow
was
chill
with
dying
and
his
soul
was
faint
with
loss
when
his
priestly
blood
dropped
downward
and
his
kingly
eyes
looked
throneward
then
pan
was
dead
by
the
love
he
stood
alone
in
his
sole
godhead
rose
complete
and
the
false
gods
fell
down
moaning
each
from
off
his
golden
seat
all
the
false
gods
with
a
cry
rendered
up
their
deity
pan
pan
was
dead
chapter
xxiv
married
to
the
god
one
thing
one
notices
very
much
as
a
that
is
the
unconscious
influence
which
christianity
has
over
a
nation
go
to
the
most
depraved
wretch
you
can
find
in
england
and
he
has
probably
got
a
conscience
if
only
one
can
get
at
it
here
the
result
of
heathenism
seems
to
be
to
destroy
men
consciences
they
never
feel
sin
as
carr
i
have
heard
people
say
they
enjoyed
hearing
about
missions
i
often
wonder
if
they
would
enjoy
watching

shipwreck
robert
stewart
leave
this
chapter
if
you
want
something
interesting
to
read
hold
your
finger
in
the
flame
of
a
candle
if
you
want
to
know
what
it
is
like
to
write
it
if
you
do
this
then
you
will
know
something
of
the
burning
at
heart
every
missionary
goes
through
who
has
to
see
the
sort
of
thing
i
have
to
write
about
such
things
do
not
make
interesting
reading
fire
is
an
uncompromising
thing
its
characteristic
is
that
it
burns
and
one
writes
with
a
hot
heart
sometimes
there
are
things
like
flames
of
fire
but
perhaps
one
cares
too
much
it
is
only
about
a
little
girl
i
was
coming
home
from
work
a
few
evenings
ago
when
i
met
two
men
and
a
child
they
were
caste
men
in
flowing
white
scarves
dignified
educated
men
but
the
child
she
glanced
up
at
me
smiled
and
salaamed
then
i
remembered
her
i
had
seen
her
before
in
her
own
home
these
men
belonged
to
her
village
what
were
they
doing
with
her
then
a
sudden
fear
shot
through
me
and
i
looked
at
the
men
and
they
laughed
we
are
taking
her
to
the
temple
there
and
they
pointed
across
through
the
trees
to
marry
her
to
the
god
it
all
passed
in
a
moment
one
of
them
caught
her
hand
and
they
went
on
i
stood
looking
after
them
just
looking
the
child
turned
once
and
waved
her
little
hand
to
me
then
the
trees
came
between
the
men
faces
haunted
me
all
night
i
slept
and
saw
them
in
my
dreams
i
woke
and
saw
them
in
the
dark
and
that
little
girl
oh
poor
little
girl
always
i
saw
her
one
hand
in
theirs
and
the
other
waving
to
me
and
now
it
is
over
the
diabolical
farce
is
over
and
she
is
tied
as
their
idiom
has
it
tied
to
the
stone
oh
she
is
tied
indeed
tied
with
ropes
satan
twisted
in
his
cruellest
hour
in
hell
we
had
to
drive
through
the
village
a
night
or
two
later
and
it
was
all
ablaze
there
was
a
crowd
and
it
broke
to
let
our
bullock
carts
pass
then
it
closed
round
two
palanquins
there
were
many
men
there
and
girls
in
the
palanquins
were
two
idols
god
and
goddess
out
on
view
it
was
their
wedding
night
we
saw
it
all
as
we
passed
the
gorgeous
decorations
gaudy
tinsels
flowers
fading
in
the
heat
and
glare
saw
long
after
we
had
passed
the
gleaming
of
the
coloured
lights
as
they
moved
among
the
trees
heard
for
a
mile
and
more
along
the
road
the
sound
of
that
heathen
revelry
and
every
thud
of
the
was
a
thud
upon
one
heart
our
little
girl
was
there
as
one
married
to
that
god
i
had
seen
her
only
once
before
she
belonged
to
an
interesting
village
one
of
those
so
lately
closed
and
because
there
they
have
a
story
about
the
magic
powder
which
say
what
we
will
they
imagine
i
dust
upon
children
faces
i
had
not
gone
often
lest
it
should
shut
the
doors
but
that
last
time
i
went
this
child
came
up
to
me
and
with
all
the
confidingness
of
a
child
asked
me
to
take
her
home
with
me
do
let
me
come
she
said
there
were
eyes
upon
me
in
a
moment
and
heads
shaken
knowingly
and
there
were
whispers
at
once
among
the
women
the
magic
dust
had
been
at
work
i
had
drawn
the
little
girl
heart
to
myself
who
could
doubt
it
now
and
one
mother
gathered
her
child
in
her
arms
and
disappeared
into
the
house
so
i
had
to
answer
carefully
so
that
everyone
could
hear
of
course
i
knew
they
would
not
give
her
to
me
and
i
thought
no
more
of
it
i
was
talking
to
her
grandmother
then
a
very
remarkable
old
lady
she
could
repeat
page
after
page
from
their
beloved
classics
and
rather
than
let
me
sing
christian
stanzas
to
her
and
explain
them
she
preferred
to
sing
hindu
stanzas
to
me
and
explain
them
consider
the
age
of
our
great
religion
consider
its
literature
millions
of
stanzas
what
can
you
have
to
compare
with
it
these
ignorant
people
about
us
do
not
appreciate
things
they
know
nothing
of
the
classics
as
for
the
language
the
depths
of
tamil
are
beyond
them
is
it
not
a
shoreless
sea
and
so
she
held
the
conversation
illustration
this
is
vile
enough
to
look
at
but
nothing
to
the
reality
if
the
outer
form
is
this
what
must
the
soul
within
it
be
yet
this
is
a
holy
brahman
and
if
we
sat
down
on
that
stone
verandah
he
would
shuffle
past
the
pillar
lest
we
should
defile
him
look
at
the
shadowy
shapes
behind
they
might
be
spirits
of
darkness
it
is
he
and
such
as
he
who
have
power
over
little
temple
flowers
it
was
just
at
this
point
the
child
reappeared
and
standing
by
the
verandah
upon
which
we
were
sitting
her
little
head
on
a
level
with
our
feet
she
joined
in
the
stanza
her
grandmother
was
chanting
and
to
my
astonishment
continued
through
the
next
and
the
next
while
i
listened
wondering
then
jumping
up
and
down
first
on
one
foot
then
on
the
other
with
her
little
face
full
of
delight
at
my
evident
surprise
she
told
me
she
was
learning
much
poetry
now
and
then
with
the
merriest
little
laugh
she
ran
off
again
to
play
and
was
the
child
all
that
brightness
all
that
intelligence
married
to
a
god
i
understood
the
question
she
had
asked
me
she
was
an
orphan
as
we
afterwards
heard
living
in
charge
of
an
old
aunt
who
had
some
connection
with
the
temple
she
must
have
heard
her
future
being
discussed
and
not
understanding
it
and
being
frightened
had
wondered
if
she
might
come
to
us
but
they
had
taken
their
own
way
of
reconciling
her
to
it
a
few
sweets
a
cake
or
two
and
a
promise
of
more
a
vision
of
the
gay
time
the
magic
word
marriage
conjures
up
and
the
child
was
content
to
go
with
them
to
be
led
to
the
temple
and
left
there
but
her
people
were
so
thoroughly
refined
and
nice
so
educated
too
could
it
be
it
be
possibly
true
yes
it
is
true
this
is
hinduism
not
in
theory
of
course
but
in
practice
think
of
it
it
is
done
a
moment
ago
i
looked
up
from
my
writing
and
saw
the
little
elf
running
towards
me
charmed
to
find
me
all
alone
and
quite
at
leisure
for
her
and
now
i
watch
her
as
she
runs
dancing
gleefully
down
the
path
turning
again
for
she
knows
i
am
watching
to
throw
kisses
to
me
and
i
think
of
her
and
her
childish
ways
naughty
ways
so
often
too
but
in
their
very
naughtiness
only
childish
and
small
and
i
shiver
as
i
think
of
her
and
a
thousand
thousand
as
small
as
she
being
trained
to
be
devil
toys
they
brought
one
here
a
few
days
ago
to
act
as
decoy
to
get
the
elf
back
she
was
a
beautiful
child
of
five
think
of
the
shame
of
it
we
are
told
to
modify
things
not
to
write
too
vividly
never
to
harrow
sensitive
hearts
friends
we
can
not
modify
truth
we
can
not
write
half
vividly
enough
and
as
for
harrowing
hearts
oh
that
we
could
do
it
that
we
could
tear
them
up
that
they
might
pour
out
like
water
that
we
could
see
hands
lifted
up
towards
god
for
the
life
of
these
young
children
oh
to
care
and
oh
for
power
to
make
others
care
not
less
but
far
far
more
care
till
our
eyes
do
fail
with
tears
for
the
destruction
of
the
daughters
of
our
people
this
photo
is
from
death
in
life
a
carcass
moving
breathing
sinning
such
a
one
sits
by
that
child
i
saw
him
once
there
is
a
monastery
near
the
temple
he
is
the
holiest
man
in
it
the
people
worship
him
the
day
i
saw
him
they
had
wreathed
him
with
flowers
white
flowers
crowned
that
hideous
head
hung
round
his
neck
and
down
his
breast
a
servant
in
front
carried
flowers
was
there
ever
such
desecration
that
vileness
crowned
with
flowers
i
knew
something
about
the
man
his
life
is
simply
unthinkable
talk
of
beasts
in
human
shape
it
is
slandering
the
good
animals
to
compare
bad
men
to
beasts
safer
far
a
tiger
den
than
that
man
monastery
but
he
is
a
temple
saint
wise
in
the
wisdom
of
his
creed
earthly
sensual
devilish
look
at
him
till
you
feel
as
if
you
had
seen
him
let
the
photo
do
its
work
it
is
loathsome
yes
now
put
a
flower
in
his
hand
a
human
flower
this
time
now
put
beside
him
if
you
can
a
little
girl
your
own
little
girl
and
leave
her
there
leave
her
there
in
his
chapter
xxv
skirting
the
abyss
the
first
thing
for
us
all
is
to
and
the
great
need
and
to
create
a
sentiment
among
christian
people
on
this
subject
one
of
the
characteristics
of
this
great
system
is
its
secrecy
its
subtlety
so
few
of
the
evils
of
it
is
so
hidden
away
in
the
secluded
lives
and
prison
homes
of
the
people
and
those
of
us
who
enter
beyond
these
veils
and
go
down
into
these
homes
are
so
apt
to
feel
that
it
is
a
case
of
the
inevitable
and
nothing
can
be
done
lee
i
have
been
to
the
great
lake
village
trying
again
to
find
out
something
about
our
little
girl
i
went
to
the
hindu
school
near
the
temple
the
schoolmaster
is
a
friend
of
ours
one
of
the
honourable
men
of
the
village
from
which
they
took
that
flower
he
was
drilling
the
little
brahman
boys
as
they
stood
in
a
row
chanting
the
poem
they
were
learning
off
by
heart
but
he
made
them
stop
when
he
saw
us
coming
and
called
us
in
i
asked
him
about
the
child
it
was
true
she
was
in
the
temple
married
to
the
stone
yes
it
was
true
they
had
taken
her
there
that
day
i
asked
if
the
family
were
poor
but
he
said
do
not
for
a
moment
think
that
poverty
was
the
cause
certainly
not
our
village
is
not
poor
and
he
looked
quite
offended
at
the
thought
i
knew
the
village
was
rich
enough
but
had
thought
perhaps
that
particular
family
might
be
poor
and
so
tempted
to
sell
the
little
one
but
he
exclaimed
with
great
warmth
certainly
not
the
child
was
a
relative
of
his
own
there
was
no
question
of
poverty
we
had
left
the
school
and
were
talking
out
in
the
street
facing
the
temple
house
i
looked
at
it
he
looked
at
it
from
hence
a
passage
broad
smooth
easy
inoffensive
down
to
hell
he
knew
it
well
yes
she
is
a
relative
of
my
own
he
continued
and
explained
minutely
the
degree
of
relationship
her
grandmother
whom
you
doubtless
remember
is
not
like
the
ignorant
women
of
these
parts
she
has
learning
and
again
he
repeated
as
if
desirous
of
thoroughly
convincing
me
as
to
the
satisfactory
nature
of
the
transaction
certainly
she
was
not
sold
she
is
a
relative
of
my
own
a
relative
of
his
own
and
he
could
teach
his
school
outside
those
walls
and
know
what
was
going
on
inside
and
never
raise
a
finger
to
stop
it
educated
hindu
though
he
is
i
could
not
understand
it
he
seemed
quite
concerned
at
my
concern
but
explained
that
for
generations
one
of
that
particular
household
had
always
been
devoted
to
the
gods
the
practice
could
not
be
defended
it
was
the
custom
that
was
all
our
custom
a
from
his
door
is
another
child
who
is
living
a
strangely
unnatural
life
which
strikes
no
one
as
unnatural
because
it
is
our
custom
she
is
quite
a
little
girl
and
as
playful
as
a
kitten
her
soft
round
arms
and
little
dimpled
hands
looked
fit
for
no
harder
work
than
play
but
she
was
pounding
rice
when
i
saw
her
and
looked
tired
and
as
if
she
wanted
her
mother
while
i
was
with
her
a
very
old
man
hobbled
in
he
was
crippled
and
leaned
full
weight
with
both
hands
on
his
stick
he
seemed
asthmatic
too
and
coughed
and
panted
woefully
a
withered
decrepit
old
ghoul
the
child
stood
up
when
he
came
in
and
touched
her
neck
where
the
marriage
symbol
lay
then
i
knew
he
was
her
husband
what
no
blush
at
the
avowal
you
dared
to
buy
a
girl
of
age
beseems
your
like
ox
or
ass
flesh
and
blood
ware
are
heart
and
soul
a
chattel
yes
like
chattels
they
are
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
in
that
auction
caste
comes
first
then
wealth
and
position
and
the
chattel
is
bought
the
bit
of
breathing
flesh
and
blood
is
converted
into
property
and
the
living
throbbing
heart
of
the
child
may
be
trampled
and
stamped
down
under
foot
in
the
mire
and
the
mud
of
that
for
all
anyone
cares
it
is
not
long
since
a
young
wife
came
for
refuge
to
our
house
three
times
she
had
tried
to
kill
herself
at
last
she
fled
to
us
her
husband
came
get
up
slave
he
said
as
she
crouched
on
the
floor
she
would
not
stir
or
speak
then
he
got
her
own
people
to
come
and
then
it
was
as
if
a
torrent
was
bursting
out
of
an
over
full
heart
you
gave
me
to
him
you
gave
me
to
him
the
words
came
over
and
over
again
she
reminded
them
in
a
passion
of
reproach
how
knowing
what
his
character
was
they
had
handed
her
over
to
him
but
we
could
hardly
follow
her
the
words
poured
forth
with
such
fierce
emotion
as
with
streaming
eyes
and
hands
that
showed
everything
in
gestures
she
besought
them
not
to
force
her
back
they
promised
and
believing
them
she
returned
with
them
the
other
day
when
i
passed
the
house
someone
said
beautiful
is
there
he
keeps
her
locked
up
in
the
back
room
now
so
they
had
broken
their
word
to
her
and
given
her
back
body
and
soul
to
the
power
of
a
man
whose
cruelty
is
so
well
known
that
even
the
heathen
call
him
a
demon
what
must
he
be
to
his
wife
and
if
that
poor
wife
nerved
by
the
misery
of
her
life
dared
all
and
appealed
to
the
government
the
law
would
do
as
her
people
did
force
her
back
again
to
him
to
fulfil
a
contract
she
never
made
is
it
not
a
shame
oh
when
will
the
day
come
when
this
merchandise
in
souls
shall
cease
we
know
that
many
husbands
are
kind
and
many
wives
perfectly
content
but
sometimes
we
see
those
who
are
not
and
there
is
no
redress
another
of
our
children
sold
by
auction
in
the
village
of
the
lake
is
one
who
used
to
be
such
a
pretty
little
thing
with
a
tangle
of
curls
and
mischievous
merry
brown
eyes
but
that
was
five
years
ago
then
a
fiend
in
a
man
shape
saw
her
and
offered
inducements
to
her
parents
which
ended
in
his
marrying
her
she
was
nine
years
old
one
year
afterwards
she
was
sent
to
her
husband
home
his
motives
in
marrying
her
were
wholly
evil
but
the
child
knew
something
of
right
and
wrong
and
she
resisted
him
then
he
dragged
her
into
an
inner
room
and
he
held
her
down
and
smothered
her
shrieks
and
pressed
a
plantain
into
her
mouth
it
was
poisoned
she
knew
it
and
did
not
swallow
it
all
but
what
she
was
forced
to
take
made
her
ill
and
she
lay
for
days
so
dizzy
and
sick
that
when
her
husband
kicked
her
as
she
lay
she
did
not
care
at
last
she
escaped
and
ran
to
her
mother
house
but
the
law
was
on
her
owner
side
what
could
she
prove
of
all
this
poor
child
and
she
had
to
go
back
to
him
after
that
he
succeeded
in
his
devil
work
and
that
child
is
dead
to
all
sense
of
sin
oh
there
are
worse
things
far
than
seeing
a
little
child
die
it
is
worse
to
see
it
change
to
see
the
innocence
pass
from
the
eyes
and
the
childishness
grow
into
wickedness
and
to
know
without
being
able
to
stop
it
just
what
is
going
on
i
am
thinking
of
one
such
now
she
was
four
years
old
when
i
first
began
to
visit
in
her
grandmother
house
she
is
six
now
only
six
but
her
demoralisation
is
almost
complete
it
is
as
if
you
saw
a
hand
pull
a
rosebud
on
its
stem
crumple
and
crush
it
rub
the
pink
loveliness
into
pulp
drop
it
then
and
you
pick
it
up
but
it
is
not
a
rosebud
now
oh
these
things
the
knowledge
of
them
is
as
a
fire
shut
up
in
bones
shut
up
for
one
can
not
let
it
all
out
it
must
stay
in
and
burn
those
who
know
nothing
of
the
facts
will
be
sure
to
criticise
it
is
not
an
unknown
thing
for
persons
to
act
as
critics
even
though
supremely
ignorant
of
the
subject
criticised
but
those
who
know
the
truth
of
these
things
well
know
that
we
have
understated
it
carefully
toned
it
down
perforce
because
it
can
not
be
written
in
full
it
could
neither
be
published
nor
read
it
can
not
be
written
or
published
or
read
but
oh
it
has
to
be
lived
what
you
may
not
even
hear
must
be
endured
by
little
there
are
in
india
of
twelve
ten
nine
and
even
eight
years
old
oh
you
mean
betrothed
another
instance
of
missionary
exaggeration
we
mean
married
but
of
course
the
law
interferes
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
the
law
which
makes
wifehood
illegal
under
twelve
with
reference
to
this
law
the
hon
manomoham
ghose
of
the
high
court
of
calcutta
writes
if
the
government
thinks
that
the
country
is
not
yet
prepared
for
such
legislation
by
which
he
means
drastic
legislation
as
i
suggest
i
can
only
express
my
regret
that
by
introducing
the
present
bill
it
has
indefinitely
postponed
the
introduction
of
a
substantial
measure
of
reform
which
is
urgently
called
for
there
are
men
and
women
in
india
to
whom
many
a
day
is
a
nightmare
and
this
fair
land
an
inferno
because
of
what
they
know
of
the
wrong
that
is
going
on
for
that
is
the
dreadful
part
of
it
it
is
not
like
the
burning
alive
of
the
widows
it
is
not
a
horror
passed
it
is
going
on
steadily
day
and
night
sunlight
moonlight
and
darkness
pass
the
one
changing
into
the
other
but
all
the
time
they
are
passing
this
wrong
holds
the
hours
with
firm
and
strong
hands
and
uses
them
for
its
purpose
the
murder
of
little
girls
meanwhile
what
can
be
done
by
you
and
by
me
to
hasten
the
day
of
its
ending
those
who
know
can
tell
what
they
know
or
so
much
as
will
bear
the
telling
and
those
who
do
not
know
can
believe
it
is
true
and
if
they
have
influence
anywhere
use
it
and
all
can
care
and
pray
praying
alone
is
not
enough
but
oh
for
more
real
praying
we
are
playing
at
praying
and
caring
and
coming
playing
at
doing
if
doing
costs
playing
at
everything
but
play
we
are
earnest
enough
about
that
god
open
our
eyes
and
convict
us
of
our
insincerity
burn
out
the
superficial
in
us
make
us
intensely
in
earnest
and
may
god
quicken
our
sympathy
and
touch
our
heart
and
nerve
our
arm
for
what
will
prove
a
desperate
fight
against
leaguèd
fiends
in
bad
men
shapes
who
do
the
devil
work
branding
on
little
innocent
souls
the
very
brand
of
hell
i
have
told
of
one
that
little
child
who
is
now
as
as
a
little
child
can
be
she
is
only
one
of
so
many
let
a
medical
missionary
speak
a
few
days
ago
we
had
a
little
here
as
a
patient
she
was
ten
or
eleven
i
think
just
a
scrap
of
a
creature
playing
with
a
doll
and
yet
degraded
unmentionably
in
mind
but
oh
to
think
of
the
hundreds
of
little
girls
it
makes
me
feel
literally
sick
we
do
what
we
can
but
what
can
we
do
what
a
drop
in
the
ocean
it
is
where
the
dotted
lines
come
there
was
written
what
can
not
be
printed
but
it
had
to
be
lived
through
every
bit
of
it
by
a
scrap
of
a
creature
of
ten
or
eleven
another
these
are
from
a
friend
who
even
in
writing
a
private
letter
can
not
say
of
the
thing
she
really
means
a
few
days
ago
the
little
mother
a
child
of
thirteen
was
crying
bitterly
in
the
ward
are
you
crying
he
says
i
am
too
old
for
him
now
he
will
get
another
wife
he
says
was
her
husband
a
lad
who
had
come
to
the
hospital
to
see
her
the
end
of
that
story
which
can
not
be
told
is
being
lived
through
this
very
day
by
that
little
wife
of
thirteen
and
remember
that
thirteen
in
india
means
barely
eleven
at
home
she
was
fourteen
years
old
they
said
but
such
a
tiny
thing
she
looked
about
nine
years
old
in
size
and
development
the
little
mother
was
so
hurt
she
can
never
be
well
again
all
her
life
the
husband
then
married
again
as
the
child
was
ruined
in
health
and
as
before
the
dots
must
cover
all
the
misery
of
that
little
child
who
looked
about
nine
there
is
an
old
old
man
living
near
here
with
a
little
wife
of
ten
or
eleven
our
present
cook
little
girl
nine
years
old
has
lately
been
married
to
a
man
who
already
has
had
two
wives
in
each
of
these
cases
as
in
each
i
have
mentioned
marriage
means
marriage
not
just
betrothal
as
so
many
fondly
imagine
only
i
heard
of
one
who
died
in
what
the
nurse
who
attended
her
described
as
simple
agony
she
had
been
married
a
week
before
she
was
barely
twelve
years
old
we
do
not
say
this
is
universal
there
are
many
exceptions
but
we
do
say
the
workings
of
this
custom
should
be
exposed
and
not
suppressed
question
our
facts
we
can
prove
them
as
i
write
it
as
you
read
it
hundreds
and
thousands
of
little
wives
are
going
through
what
we
have
described
but
described
is
not
the
word
to
use
indicated
i
should
say
with
the
faintest
wash
of
sepia
where
the
thing
meant
is
pitch
black
think
of
it
then
do
not
try
to
escape
from
the
thought
english
women
know
too
little
care
too
little
too
little
by
far
think
of
it
stop
and
think
of
it
if
it
is
trying
to
think
of
it
and
you
would
prefer
to
turn
the
page
over
and
get
to
something
nicer
to
read
must
it
be
to
live
through
what
must
it
be
to
those
little
girls
so
little
so
pitifully
little
and
unequal
to
it
all
what
must
it
be
to
these
childish
things
to
live
on
through
it
day
by
day
with
in
some
cases
nothing
to
hope
for
till
kindly
death
comes
and
opens
the
door
the
one
dread
door
of
escape
they
know
and
the
tortured
little
body
dies
and
someone
says
the
girl
is
dead
take
the
corpse
out
to
the
then
they
take
it
up
gently
perhaps
but
oh
the
relief
of
remembering
it
it
does
not
matter
now
nothing
matters
any
more
little
dead
wives
can
not
feel
i
wonder
whether
it
touches
you
i
know
i
can
not
tell
it
well
but
oh
one
lives
through
it
all
with
them
i
have
stopped
writing
again
and
again
and
felt
i
could
not
go
on
mother
happy
mother
when
you
tuck
up
your
little
girl
in
her
cot
and
feel
her
arms
cling
round
your
neck
and
her
kisses
on
your
cheek
will
you
think
of
these
other
little
girls
will
you
try
to
conceive
what
you
would
feel
your
little
girl
were
oh
you
clasp
her
tight
so
tight
in
your
arms
the
thought
is
a
scorpion
sting
in
your
soul
you
would
kill
her
smother
her
dead
in
your
arms
before
you
would
give
her
to
turn
the
light
down
and
come
away
thank
god
she
is
safe
in
her
little
cot
she
will
wake
up
safe
now
think
for
a
moment
steadily
of
those
who
are
somebody
little
girls
just
as
dear
to
them
and
sweet
needing
as
much
the
tenderest
care
as
this
your
own
little
girl
think
of
them
try
to
think
of
them
as
if
they
were
your
very
own
they
are
just
like
your
own
in
so
many
ways
only
their
future
is
different
oh
dear
mothers
do
you
care
do
you
care
very
much
i
ask
we
passed
the
temple
on
our
way
home
from
the
village
of
the
lake
the
great
gate
was
open
and
the
brahmans
and
their
friends
were
lounging
in
and
out
or
sitting
in
the
porch
talking
and
laughing
together
they
were
talking
about
us
as
we
passed
they
were
quite
aware
of
our
object
in
coming
and
were
pleased
that
we
had
failed
government
officials
graduates
educated
hindus
like
our
old
friend
the
schoolmaster
all
would
admit
in
private
that
to
take
a
child
to
the
temple
and
marry
her
there
was
wrong
but
very
few
have
much
desire
to
right
the
shameful
wrong
there
are
thousands
of
recognised
slaves
of
the
gods
in
this
presidency
under
other
names
they
exist
all
over
india
there
are
thousands
of
little
fewer
here
than
elsewhere
we
know
but
many
everywhere
i
do
not
for
a
moment
suggest
that
all
are
cruelly
handled
any
more
than
i
would
have
it
thought
that
all
little
girls
are
available
for
the
service
of
the
gods
nor
would
i
have
it
supposed
that
we
see
down
this
every
day
we
may
live
for
years
in
the
country
and
know
very
little
about
it
the
medical
workers
god
help
them
are
those
who
are
most
frequently
forced
to
look
down
and
i
not
being
a
medical
know
infinitely
less
of
its
depths
than
they
but
this
i
do
know
and
do
mean
and
i
mean
it
with
an
intensity
i
know
not
how
to
express
this
custom
of
infant
marriage
and
child
marriage
whether
to
gods
or
men
is
an
infamous
custom
that
it
holds
possibilities
of
wrong
such
unutterable
wrong
that
descriptive
words
concerning
it
can
only
skirt
the
abyss
and
that
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
just
and
all
that
is
merciful
it
should
be
swept
out
of
the
land
without
a
day
we
look
to
our
indian
brothers
india
is
so
immense
that
a
voice
crying
in
the
north
is
hardly
heard
in
the
south
thank
god
for
the
one
or
two
voices
crying
in
the
wilderness
but
many
voices
are
needed
not
only
one
or
two
let
the
many
voices
cry
every
man
with
a
heart
and
a
voice
to
cry
should
cry
then
all
the
cries
crying
over
the
land
will
force
the
deaf
ears
to
hear
and
force
the
dull
brains
to
think
and
the
hands
of
the
law
to
act
and
something
at
last
will
be
done
but
crying
is
not
nearly
enough
we
look
to
you
brothers
of
india
to
get
convictions
upon
this
subject
which
will
compel
you
to
many
can
talk
and
many
can
write
and
more
will
do
both
as
the
years
pass
but
the
crux
is
contained
in
the
god
alone
can
strengthen
you
for
it
he
who
set
his
face
as
a
flint
can
make
you
steadfast
and
brave
enough
to
set
your
faces
as
flints
till
the
bands
of
wickedness
are
loosed
and
the
heavy
burdens
are
undone
and
every
yoke
is
broken
and
the
oppressed
go
free
it
will
cost
it
is
bound
to
cost
every
battle
of
the
warrior
is
with
confused
noise
and
garments
rolled
in
blood
it
is
only
sham
battles
that
cost
something
less
than
blood
everything
worth
anything
reproach
hath
broken
my
heart
a
broken
heart
bleeds
is
it
the
reproach
of
the
battle
you
fear
this
fear
will
conquer
you
until
you
hear
the
voice
of
your
god
saying
fear
ye
not
the
reproach
of
men
neither
be
afraid
of
their
revilings
who
art
thou
that
thou
shouldest
be
afraid
of
a
man
that
shall
die
and
the
son
of
man
that
shall
be
made
as
grass
and
forgettest
the
lord
thy
maker
this
book
is
meant
for
our
comrades
at
home
but
it
may
come
back
to
india
and
so
we
have
spoken
straight
from
our
hearts
to
our
indian
brothers
here
oh
brothers
rise
and
in
god
name
fight
in
his
power
fight
till
you
win
for
these
your
own
land
little
girls
who
never
can
fight
for
themselves
and
now
we
look
to
you
at
home
will
all
who
pity
the
little
wives
pray
for
the
men
of
india
pray
for
those
who
are
honestly
striving
to
rid
the
land
of
this
shameful
curse
pray
that
they
may
be
nerved
for
the
fight
by
the
power
of
god
right
arm
pray
for
all
the
irresolute
a
sound
of
battle
is
in
the
land
the
lord
hath
opened
his
armoury
cursed
be
he
that
keepeth
back
his
sword
from
blood
pray
for
resolution
and
the
courage
of
conviction
it
is
needed
and
to
this
end
pray
that
the
spirit
of
life
may
come
upon
our
mission
colleges
and
mightily
energise
the
missionary
educational
movement
that
hindu
students
may
be
won
to
allegiance
to
christ
while
they
are
students
before
they
become
entangled
in
the
social
mesh
of
hinduism
and
pray
we
earnestly
plead
with
you
that
the
christian
students
may
meet
god
at
college
and
come
out
strong
to
fight
this
fiend
which
trades
in
slaves
and
souls
of
men
and
in
the
souls
of
little
girls
chapter
xxvi
from
a
hindu
point
of
view
the
lord
preserve
us
from
innovations
foreign
to
the
true
principles
of
the
protestant
church
and
foreign
to
the
principles
of
the
pictures
crosses
and
banners
with
processions
would
do
great
harm
the
mohammedan
natives
would
say
you
worship
idols
as
the
hindus
do
and
have
taziyas
processions
as
well
as
the
mohammedans
and
our
christians
would
mourn
over
such
things
leupolt
i
am
sitting
in
the
corner
of
the
verandah
of
a
little
mission
bungalow
on
the
outskirts
of
a
town
sixteen
miles
south
of
our
eastern
headquarters
this
is
the
town
where
they
set
fire
to
the
schoolroom
when
victory
came
so
far
does
caste
feeling
fly
as
you
sit
in
the
corner
of
this
verandah
you
see
a
little
temple
fitted
between
two
whitewashed
pillars
roughly
built
and
rudely
decorated
but
in
this
early
morning
light
it
looks
like
a
picture
set
in
a
frame
it
is
just
outside
the
compound
so
near
that
you
see
it
in
all
its
detail
of
colour
the
sun
striking
across
it
touches
the
colours
and
makes
them
beautiful
there
is
the
usual
striped
wall
red
and
white
the
red
is
a
fine
the
colour
of
the
sand
the
central
block
the
shrine
itself
has
inlays
of
green
red
and
blue
there
is
more
in
the
roof
some
yellow
too
and
white
beyond
on
either
side
there
are
houses
and
beyond
the
houses
trees
and
sky
it
is
all
very
pretty
and
peaceful
smoke
is
curling
up
in
the
still
air
from
some
early
lighted
fire
out
of
doors
there
are
voices
of
people
going
and
coming
softened
by
distance
there
is
the
musical
jingle
of
bullock
bells
here
in
the
compound
and
out
on
the
road
and
there
is
the
twitter
of
birds
in
front
of
that
temple
there
are
three
altars
and
in
front
of
the
altars
a
pillar
i
can
see
it
from
where
i
am
sitting
now
rough
grey
stone
upon
it
there
is
what
i
thought
at
first
was
a
and
i
wondered
what
it
was
doing
there
then
i
saw
it
had
not
a
dial
plate
only
a
strong
of
wood
and
the
index
finger
so
to
speak
was
longer
than
one
would
expect
a
sharp
wooden
spike
as
i
was
wondering
what
it
was
a
explained
it
it
is
not
a
it
is
an
impaling
instrument
on
that
spike
they
used
to
impale
alive
goats
and
kids
and
fowls
as
offerings
to
the
god
siva
and
his
two
wives
the
deities
to
whose
honour
the
three
altars
stand
before
the
little
shrine
the
pillar
on
which
stands
this
infernal
spike
has
three
circles
scored
into
it
sign
of
the
three
divinities
the
impaling
has
stopped
say
the
people
greatly
amused
at
horror
and
distress
for
at
first
i
thought
perhaps
they
still
did
it
now
we
do
not
impale
alive
the
government
has
stopped
it
thank
god
for
that
but
oh
let
all
lovers
of
god
creatures
pray
for
and
hasten
the
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
government
may
step
in
and
stop
the
public
clubbing
to
death
of
buffaloes
and
the
impaling
of
goats
and
fowls
in
sacrifice
but
it
can
not
stop
the
private
cruelty
and
the
still
indifference
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
not
themselves
cruel
only
the
coming
of
christ
the
compassionate
can
do
that
there
was
the
sound
of
voices
just
then
as
i
wrote
many
voices
coming
nearer
shrill
women
voices
cutting
through
one
thoughts
and
i
went
out
to
see
what
was
going
on
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
opposite
our
gate
there
is
a
huge
old
double
tree
the
sacred
fig
tree
of
india
intertwined
with
another
a
religious
symbol
to
this
people
underneath
is
a
stone
platform
and
on
it
the
hideous
on
the
same
side
is
a
little
house
a
group
of
women
were
gathered
under
the
shade
near
the
house
evidently
waiting
for
something
or
someone
they
were
delighted
to
talk
we
spent
half
an
hour
under
the
tree
and
they
listened
but
we
were
interrupted
by
some
government
officials
with
their
coats
sashes
and
badges
and
one
not
strictly
governmental
got
up
in
a
marvellous
fashion
and
they
joined
the
group
and
monopolised
the
conversation
i
waited
hoping
they
would
soon
go
away
and
i
listened
to
what
they
were
saying
yes
she
actually
appeared
she
was
a
goddess
a
goddess
oh
from
the
women
she
came
forward
moving
without
walking
and
she
stood
as
a
tree
stands
and
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
blessed
the
people
and
vanished
a
woman
pointed
to
me
like
her
was
she
like
her
like
her
and
the
government
official
was
a
little
contemptuous
did
i
not
say
she
was
a
goddess
is
this
missie
ammal
a
goddess
is
she
not
a
mere
woman
like
yourselves
only
white
also
came
from
the
bungalow
objected
the
woman
rather
feebly
feeling
public
opinion
against
her
you
oyster
said
the
official
politely
because
a
missie
ammal
comes
from
the
bungalow
does
it
prove
that
the
goddess
was
a
missie
ammal
the
other
women
agreed
with
him
and
snubbed
the
ignoramus
who
retired
from
the
controversy
the
story
was
repeated
with
variations
such
a
mixture
of
the
probable
with
the
improbable
not
to
say
impossible
that
one
got
tangled
up
in
it
before
he
had
got
half
through
just
then
an
ancient
christian
appeared
on
the
scene
and
quavered
in
in
the
middle
of
the
marvel
with
words
to
the
effect
that
our
god
was
the
true
god
and
they
ought
to
have
faith
in
him
it
was
not
exactly
of
anything
they
were
discussing
but
he
seemed
to
think
it
the
right
thing
to
say
and
they
accepted
it
as
a
customary
remark
and
went
on
with
their
conversation
i
asked
the
old
worthy
if
he
knew
anything
about
the
story
and
at
first
he
denied
it
indignantly
as
savouring
too
much
of
idolatry
to
be
connected
with
the
bungalow
but
finally
admitted
that
once
in
the
dim
past
he
had
heard
that
an
ammal
in
the
bungalow
who
was
ill
and
disturbed
by
the
at
night
got
up
and
went
out
and
tried
to
speak
to
the
people
and
the
men
listening
now
to
the
old
man
threw
in
a
word
which
illumined
the
whole
it
was
a
great
festival
i
remembered
that
impaling
stake
and
understood
it
all
and
in
a
flash
i
saw
it
the
poor
live
beast
and
heard
its
cries
they
would
wring
her
heart
as
she
heard
them
in
the
pauses
of
the
she
was
ill
but
she
got
up
and
struggled
out
and
tried
to
stop
it
i
am
sure
tried
and
failed
seven
thousand
miles
away
these
things
may
seem
trivial
here
with
that
grey
stone
pillar
full
in
view
they
are
real
i
came
back
to
the
present
the
women
were
still
there
and
more
people
were
gathering
something
was
going
to
happen
then
a
sudden
burst
of
and
a
banging
and
clanging
of
all
manner
of
and
then
a
bullock
coach
drove
up
a
great
gilded
thing
it
stopped
in
front
of
the
little
house
someone
got
out
the
people
shouted
guru
great
guru
lord
guru
with
wild
enthusiasm
the
guru
was
not
poor
he
had
two
carts
laden
with
luggage
one
item
a
green
parrot
in
a
cage
close
to
the
cage
a
small
boy
was
thundering
away
on
a
but
it
did
not
disturb
the
parrot
the
people
seemed
to
think
this
display
of
wealth
demanded
an
apology
it
is
not
his
it
belongs
to
his
followers
he
being
what
he
is
requires
none
of
these
things
they
said
i
had
to
go
then
and
we
started
soon
afterwards
on
our
day
round
and
i
do
not
know
what
happened
next
but
i
had
never
had
the
chance
of
a
talk
with
a
celebrity
of
this
description
and
in
the
evening
on
my
homeward
way
i
stopped
before
the
little
house
and
asked
if
i
might
see
him
the
famous
guru
of
one
of
the
greatest
of
south
indian
castes
the
government
officials
of
the
morning
were
there
but
the
officialism
was
gone
no
coats
and
sashes
and
badges
now
only
the
simple
national
dress
a
scarf
of
white
muslin
the
one
who
in
the
morning
had
been
an
illustration
of
the
possible
effect
of
the
mixture
of
east
and
west
stood
in
a
dignity
he
had
not
then
a
fine
manly
form
the
door
was
open
and
they
were
sentry
for
their
guru
was
resting
they
said
then
he
is
very
human
just
like
yourselves
but
the
strong
sensible
faces
looked
almost
frightened
at
the
words
hush
they
answered
all
in
a
breath
no
such
thoughts
may
be
even
thought
here
he
is
not
just
like
us
and
as
if
to
divert
us
from
the
expression
of
such
sentiments
they
moved
a
little
from
the
door
and
said
you
may
look
if
you
do
not
speak
and
knowing
such
looks
are
not
often
allowed
i
looked
with
interest
and
saw
all
there
was
to
see
the
guru
was
in
the
far
corner
resting
a
rich
purple
silk
with
gold
interwoven
in
borders
and
bands
was
flung
over
his
ascetic
dress
at
the
far
end
too
was
a
sort
of
altar
covered
with
red
cloth
and
on
it
were
numerous
brass
candlesticks
and
vessels
and
on
a
little
shelf
above
a
row
of
little
divinities
some
brass
ornaments
and
flowers
to
the
left
of
this
altar
there
was
a
chair
covered
by
a
deer
skin
there
were
pictures
of
gods
and
goddesses
round
the
room
especially
near
the
altar
and
there
were
the
usual
censers
rosaries
and
musical
instruments
and
there
was
the
parrot
the
government
official
pointed
in
and
said
with
an
air
of
pride
in
the
whole
and
a
certainty
of
sympathy
too
there
you
see
how
closely
it
resembles
your
churches
there
is
not
so
much
difference
between
you
and
us
after
all
not
so
much
difference
there
is
a
very
great
difference
i
told
him
and
i
asked
him
where
he
had
seen
a
christian
church
like
this
he
mentioned
two
one
was
a
roman
catholic
chapel
the
other
an
english
church
what
could
i
say
they
bear
our
name
how
could
he
understand
the
divisions
that
rend
us
asunder
romanists
ritualists
and
protestants
are
we
not
all
called
christians
i
looked
again
and
i
could
not
help
being
struck
with
the
resemblance
the
altar
with
its
brasses
and
flowers
and
candlesticks
and
the
little
shelf
above
the
pictures
on
the
walls
the
chair
so
like
a
chair
of
state
the
whole
air
of
the
place
heavy
with
incense
was
redolent
of
rome
he
went
on
to
explain
while
i
stood
there
ashamed
look
have
you
not
got
that
and
he
pointed
to
the
erection
with
the
red
cloth
and
the
flowers
we
have
nothing
of
the
sort
in
our
church
come
and
see
we
have
only
a
table
i
said
but
he
laughed
and
declared
he
had
seen
it
in
other
churches
and
it
was
just
like
ours
only
yours
has
a
cross
above
it
and
ours
has
images
but
you
bow
to
your
cross
so
it
must
represent
a
divinity
and
without
waiting
for
any
reply
he
pointed
next
to
the
pictures
they
are
very
like
yours
i
think
he
said
only
yours
show
your
god
on
a
cross
stretched
out
and
dying
so
and
he
stretched
out
his
arms
and
dropped
his
head
and
said
something
which
can
not
be
translated
and
i
could
not
look
or
listen
but
broke
in
earnestly
indeed
we
have
no
such
pictures
at
least
we
here
have
not
but
even
if
some
show
such
a
picture
do
they
ever
call
it
a
picture
of
god
they
only
say
it
is
a
picture
of
but
he
interrupted
impatiently
do
not
i
know
what
they
say
and
then
with
a
touch
of
scorn
at
what
he
thought
was
an
empty
excuse
on
my
part
he
added
we
also
say
the
same
which
is
true
no
intelligent
hindu
admits
that
he
worships
idols
or
pictures
he
worships
what
these
things
represent
your
people
show
your
symbols
he
continued
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
sure
of
his
ground
exactly
as
we
show
ours
i
have
seen
your
god
on
a
great
sheet
at
night
it
was
shown
by
means
of
a
magic
lamp
and
sometimes
you
make
it
of
wood
or
brass
as
we
make
ours
of
stone
the
name
may
change
and
the
manner
of
making
but
the
thing
essence
is
the
same
the
mohammedans
do
not
show
their
god
symbol
but
we
do
and
so
do
the
christians
therefore
between
us
and
the
christians
there
is
more
in
common
than
between
the
mohammedans
and
us
this
was
another
contribution
to
the
argument
the
chair
now
served
as
a
text
when
your
bishop
comes
round
your
churches
does
he
not
sit
in
a
chair
like
that
himself
apart
from
the
people
and
in
like
manner
our
guru
sits
there
is
much
similarity
also
do
not
your
christians
stand
and
he
imitated
the
peculiarly
deferential
attitude
adopted
on
such
occasions
by
some
just
in
the
fashion
that
we
stand
and
do
not
your
people
feel
themselves
blessed
by
the
presence
of
the
great
oh
there
is
much
similarity
i
explained
that
all
this
though
foolish
was
not
intended
for
more
than
respect
and
our
bishops
did
not
desire
it
at
which
he
smiled
then
he
went
on
to
expatiate
upon
what
he
had
seen
in
some
of
our
churches
probably
while
on
duty
as
government
servant
the
display
as
it
seemed
to
him
so
like
this
the
pomp
as
he
thought
it
so
fine
like
this
the
bowing
and
prostrating
and
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
did
not
do
these
things
the
evident
participation
in
the
whole
grand
show
and
the
other
men
who
apparently
had
looked
in
through
the
open
windows
and
doors
agreed
with
him
he
is
not
the
first
who
has
been
stumbled
in
the
same
way
and
i
remembered
as
he
talked
what
a
mohammedan
woman
said
to
a
friend
of
mine
about
one
of
our
english
churches
seen
through
her
husband
eyes
you
have
idols
in
your
church
she
said
to
which
you
bow
in
worship
she
referred
to
the
things
on
or
above
the
communion
table
my
friend
explained
the
things
were
not
idols
then
why
do
your
people
bow
to
them
was
there
nothing
in
the
question
often
we
wonder
whether
the
rapid
but
insidious
increase
of
ritual
in
india
is
understood
at
home
in
england
it
is
bad
enough
but
in
a
heathen
and
mohammedan
land
it
is
if
possible
worse
and
the
worst
is
the
spirit
of
it
or
the
spirit
of
tolerance
toward
it
which
is
on
the
increase
even
in
missionary
circles
some
of
our
tamil
people
attend
the
english
service
in
these
advanced
churches
after
their
own
service
is
over
and
thus
become
familiarised
with
and
gradually
acclimatised
to
an
ecclesiastical
atmosphere
foreign
to
them
as
members
of
a
protestant
society
i
remember
spending
a
sunday
afternoon
with
a
worthy
pastor
and
his
wife
stationed
in
the
place
where
the
church
is
in
which
the
idols
are
worshipped
according
to
the
mohammedans
when
the
bell
rang
for
evening
service
he
began
to
shuffle
rather
as
if
he
wanted
me
to
go
but
he
was
too
polite
to
say
so
and
the
reason
never
struck
me
till
his
son
came
in
with
an
english
bible
and
the
old
man
put
up
his
hand
to
his
mouth
in
the
apologetic
manner
of
the
tamils
we
do
not
notice
the
foolish
parts
of
the
service
we
like
to
hear
the
english
for
the
sake
of
the
english
we
go
he
did
not
turn
to
the
east
but
he
did
not
keep
quite
straight
he
just
half
turned
this
from
a
pastor
wife
about
one
whom
she
had
been
observing
during
an
ordination
ceremony
in
the
english
cathedral
just
half
it
describes
the
nebulous
attitude
of
mind
of
many
a
one
india
has
not
our
historical
background
it
has
no
book
of
yet
perhaps
that
is
why
its
people
are
so
indifferent
upon
points
which
seem
of
importance
to
us
they
have
not
had
to
fight
for
their
freedom
in
the
sense
at
least
our
forefathers
fought
there
is
no
puritan
blood
in
their
veins
and
so
they
are
willing
to
follow
the
lead
of
almost
anyone
provided
that
lead
is
given
steadily
and
persistently
which
surely
should
make
those
in
authority
careful
as
to
those
in
whose
hands
that
lead
is
placed
but
the
natural
instinct
of
the
converted
idolater
is
dead
against
complexity
in
worship
and
for
simplicity
he
does
not
want
something
as
like
his
own
old
religion
as
possible
but
as
different
as
possible
from
it
and
so
we
have
good
building
material
ready
to
hand
and
a
foundation
ready
laid
but
let
every
man
take
heed
how
he
buildeth
thereupon
i
hope
this
does
not
sound
unkind
we
give
those
who
hold
different
views
full
credit
for
sincerity
and
a
right
to
their
own
opinions
but
convictions
are
convictions
and
without
judging
others
who
differ
these
are
ours
and
we
want
those
at
home
who
are
with
us
in
these
things
to
unite
to
help
to
stem
the
tide
that
has
already
risen
in
india
far
higher
than
perhaps
they
know
brave
men
are
needed
men
with
a
fuller
development
of
spiritual
vertebræ
than
is
common
in
these
days
and
we
need
such
men
in
our
native
church
god
create
them
they
are
not
the
product
of
theological
colleges
and
may
god
save
his
missions
in
india
from
wasting
his
time
and
money
and
men
on
the
cultivation
of
what
may
evolve
into
something
of
no
more
use
to
creation
than
a
new
genus
of
the
government
official
and
his
friends
were
still
talking
among
themselves
do
we
not
know
what
the
christians
do
have
we
not
ears
have
we
not
eyes
they
do
it
in
their
way
we
do
it
in
ours
the
thing
itself
is
really
the
same
yes
their
religion
is
just
like
ours
they
could
not
see
the
vital
difference
between
even
the
most
vitiated
forms
of
christianity
and
their
own
hinduism
there
were
so
many
resemblances
and
these
filled
their
mental
vision
at
the
moment
one
could
hardly
wonder
they
could
not
they
turned
to
me
again
and
with
all
the
vigour
of
language
at
my
command
i
told
them
that
neither
we
nor
those
with
us
ever
went
to
any
church
where
we
had
reason
to
think
there
would
be
an
exhibition
of
ecclesiastical
paraphernalia
we
did
not
believe
it
was
in
accordance
with
the
simplicity
of
the
gospel
and
i
told
them
how
simple
the
truth
really
was
but
they
would
not
believe
me
those
sights
they
had
seen
had
struck
them
much
as
they
struck
the
convert
who
described
the
confirmation
service
thus
we
went
up
and
knelt
down
before
a
stick
the
bishop
pastoral
staff
they
had
observed
the
immense
attention
paid
to
all
these
sacred
trifles
and
naturally
they
appeared
to
them
as
essential
to
the
whole
part
of
it
nearly
all
of
it
in
fact
and
even
where
the
service
was
in
the
vernacular
their
attention
had
been
entirely
diverted
from
the
thing
heard
by
the
things
seen
then
i
thought
of
the
description
of
a
primitive
christianity
service
as
given
in
corinthians
there
the
idea
evidently
was
that
if
an
outsider
came
in
or
looked
in
as
hindus
and
mohammedans
so
often
look
in
here
he
should
understand
what
was
going
on
and
being
convicted
of
his
sin
and
need
should
be
convinced
and
so
falling
down
on
his
face
he
will
worship
god
and
report
that
god
is
in
you
of
a
truth
compare
the
effect
produced
upon
the
minds
of
these
hindu
men
by
what
they
saw
of
our
services
with
the
effect
intended
to
be
produced
by
the
holy
ghost
can
we
say
we
have
improved
upon
his
pattern
oh
for
a
return
to
the
simplicity
and
power
of
the
gospel
of
christ
then
we
should
not
roll
like
these
in
our
indian
brother
way
oh
for
a
return
to
the
days
of
the
beginning
of
the
acts
of
the
apostles
to
obscurity
and
poverty
and
suffering
and
shame
and
the
utter
absence
of
all
earthly
glory
and
the
winning
of
souls
of
a
different
make
to
the
type
thought
sufficiently
spiritual
now
oh
for
more
of
the
signs
of
apostleship
scars
and
the
cross
the
real
cross
the
reproach
of
christ
the
crucified
no
mitre
here
but
there
the
crown
chapter
xxvii
though
ye
know
him
not
i
have
known
cases
of
young
ministers
dissuaded
from
facing
the
missionary
call
by
those
who
posed
as
friends
of
foreign
missions
and
yet
presumed
to
argue
spiritual
power
and
intellectual
attainments
are
needed
by
the
church
at
home
they
would
be
wasted
in
the
foreign
field
power
wasted
in
a
land
like
india
where
is
it
so
sorely
needed
as
in
a
continent
where
satan
has
constructed
his
strongest
fortresses
and
displayed
the
choicest
masterpieces
of
his
skill
ability
wasted
among
a
people
whose
scholars
smile
inwardly
at
the
ignorance
of
the
average
western
brothers
god

be
not
deterred
by
flimsy
subterfuges
such
as
these
you
will
need
the
power
of
god
the
holy
ghost
to
make
you
an
efficient
missionary
you
will
find
your
reputation
for
scholarship
put
to
the
severest
test
in

here
is
ample

for

of

power
and
for
intellectual
giants
and
so
i
repeat
god
is
calling
buckle
on
your
sword
come
to
the
fight
and
win
your
spurs
among
the
cultured
sons
of
india
walker
the
sensation
you
experience
is
curious
when
you
rise
from
the
study
of
sir
monier
william
and
and
go
out
to
your
work
and
meet
in
that
work
someone
who
seems
to
be
quoting
that
same
book
not
in
paragraphs
only
but
in
pages
he
is
talking
tamil
and
the
book
is
written
in
english
that
is
all
the
difference
he
was
standing
by
the
wayside
when
i
saw
him
we
got
into
conversation
at
first
he
reminded
me
of
a
sea
anemone
with
all
its
tentacles
drawn
inside
but
gradually
one
by
one
they
came
out
and
i
saw
what
he
really
was
and
i
think
the
great
christian
scholar
who
laboured
so
hard
to
understand
and
translate
into
words
the
intricacies
and
mysteries
of
indian
thought
would
have
felt
a
little
repaid
had
he
known
how
his
work
would
help
in
the
practical
business
of
a
missionary
life
part
of
our
business
is
to
meet
the
mind
with
which
we
are
dealing
with
quick
comprehension
it
is
in
this
sir
monier
williams
helps
when
once
this
man
felt
himself
understood
his
whole
attitude
changed
at
first
expecting
i
suppose
that
he
was
being
mistaken
for
an
ignorant
heathen
and
worshipper
of
stocks
and
stones
he
hardly
took
the
trouble
to
do
more
than
answer
as
he
thought
a
fool
according
to
his
folly
the
tentacles
were
all
then
but
that
passed
soon
and
he
pointed
to
the
shed
behind
him
where
two
or
three
idol
horses
stood
and
said
how
childish
he
knew
it
was
foolish
and
vain
but
then
what
else
could
be
done
idols
are
not
objects
of
worship
and
never
were
intended
so
to
be
their
only
use
is
to
help
the
uninitiated
to
worship
something
if
nothing
were
shown
them
they
would
worship
nothing
and
a
human
being
is
an
animal
not
a
man
he
went
on
to
answer
the
objections
to
this
means
of
quickening
intelligent
worship
by
explaining
how
in
higher
and
purer
ways
the
thinkers
of
hinduism
had
tried
to
make
the
unthinking
think
look
at
our
temples
he
said
there
is
a
central
shrine
with
only
one
light
in
it
the
darkness
of
the
shrine
symbolises
the
darkness
of
the
world
of
life
and
death
and
being
for
life
is
a
darkness
a
whirlpool
of
dark
waters
we
stand
on
its
edge
but
we
do
not
understand
it
it
is
dark
but
light
there
must
be
one
great
light
so
we
show
this
certainty
by
the
symbol
of
the
one
light
in
the
shrine
in
the
very
heart
of
our
temples
this
led
on
to
quotations
from
his
own
books
questioning
the
validity
of
such
lights
which
he
finished
the
moment
one
began
them
and
this
again
led
to
our
lord
words
how
strong
they
sounded
and
how
direct
am
the
light
of
the
but
he
could
not
accept
them
in
their
simplicity
and
here
it
was
that
the
book
i
had
been
reading
came
in
so
helpfully
he
spoke
rapidly
and
eagerly
and
such
a
mixture
of
sanscrit
and
tamil
that
if
i
had
not
had
the
clue
i
am
not
sure
i
could
have
followed
him
and
to
have
misunderstood
him
then
might
have
driven
all
the
tentacles
in
and
made
it
harder
for
the
next
one
whom
the
spirit
may
send
to
win
his
confidence
he
told
me
that
after
much
study
of
many
religions
he
held
the
eternal
existence
of
one
brahma
the
human
spirit
he
said
is
not
really
distinct
from
the
divine
spirit
but
identical
with
it
the
apparent
distinction
arises
from
our
illusory
view
of
things
there
is
absolutely
no
distinction
in
spirit
mind
is
distinct
he
admitted
and
body
is
distinct
but
spirit
is
identical
so
that
in
a
definitely
defined
sense
i
am
god
god
is
i
the
two
are
one
in
all
essentials
of
being
and
he
touched
himself
and
said
i
am
brahma
i
myself
my
real
i
am
god
it
sounds
terribly
irreverent
but
he
did
not
for
a
moment
mean
it
so
go
back
to
ii
and
try
to
define
the
meaning
of
the
words
the
breath
of
life
and
you
will
if
you
think
enough
find
yourself
in
a
position
to
understand
how
the
hindu
without
revelation
ends
as
he
does
in
delusion
but
intertwined
with
this
central
fibre
of
his
faith
there
were
strands
of
a
strange
philosophy
he
held
strongly
the
doctrine
of
illusion
by
which
the
one
impersonal
spirit
in
the
illusion
which
overspreads
it
is
to
the
external
world
what
yarn
is
to
cloth
what
milk
is
to
curds
what
clay
is
to
a
jar
but
only
in
that
illusion
that
is
he
is
not
the
actual
material
cause
of
the
world
as
clay
of
a
jar
but
the
illusory
material
cause
as
a
rope
might
be
of
a
snake
and
the
spirit
of
man
is
that
spirit
personalised
and
limited
by
the
power
of
illusion
and
the
life
of
every
living
spirit
is
nothing
but
an
infinitesimal
arc
of
the
one
endless
circle
of
infinite
existence
of
course
there
are
answers
to
this
sort
of
reasoning
which
are
perfectly
convincing
to
the
western
but
they
fail
to
appeal
to
the
eastern
mind
you
suggest
a
practical
test
as
to
the
reality
or
otherwise
of
this
illusion
touch
something
run
a
pin
into
yourself
do
anything
to
prove
to
yourself
your
own
actuality
and
he
has
his
answer
ready
though
theoretically
he
holds
that
there
is
one
and
only
one
spirit
he
virtually
believes
in
three
conditions
of
being
the
real
the
practical
and
the
illusory
for
while
he
affirms
that
the
one
spirit
brahma
alone
has
a
real
existence
he
allows
a
practical
separate
existence
to
human
spirits
to
the
world
and
to
the
personal
god
or
gods
as
well
as
an
illusory
existence
hence
every
object
is
to
be
dealt
with
practically
as
if
it
were
really
what
it
appears
to
be
this
is
only
the
end
of
a
long
and
very
confusing
argument
which
i
expect
i
did
not
half
understand
and
he
concluded
it
by
quoting
a
stanza
thus
translated
by
pope
from
an
ancient
tamil
classic
o
being
hard
to
reach
o
splendour
infinite
unknown
in
sooth
i
know
not
what
to
do
he
is
far
away
from
me
he
said
a
distant
god
to
reach
and
when
i
quoted
from
augustine
to
him
who
is
everywhere
men
come
not
by
travelling
but
by
loving
and
showed
him
the
words
which
in
tamil
are
splendidly
negative
he
is
not
far
from
every
one
of
us
he
eluded
the
comfort
and
went
back
to
the
old
question
what
is
truth
how
can
one
prove
what
is
truth
there
is
an
indian
story
of
a
queen
who
proved
the
truth
by
tasting
the
food
the
story
tells
how
her
husband
who
dearly
loved
her
and
whom
she
dearly
loved
lost
his
kingdom
wandered
away
with
his
queen
into
the
forest
left
her
there
as
she
slept
hoping
she
would
fare
better
without
him
and
followed
her
long
afterwards
to
her
father
court
deformed
disguised
a
servant
among
servants
a
then
her
maidens
came
to
her
told
her
of
the
wonderful
cooking
magical
in
manner
marvellous
in
flavour
and
in
fragrance
they
are
sure
it
is
the
king
come
back
to
her
and
they
bid
her
believe
and
rejoice
but
the
queen
fears
it
may
not
be
true
she
must
prove
it
she
must
taste
the
food
they
bring
her
some
tastes
and
and
the
story
ends
in
joy
oh
taste
and
see
that
the
lord
is
good
if
any
man
will
do
his
will
he
shall
know
we
got
closer
in
thought
after
this
for
the
oriental
a
story
is
an
illuminating
thing
i
have
sought
for
the
way
of
truth
he
said
and
sought
for
the
way
of
light
and
life
behind
me
as
i
look
there
is
darkness
before
me
there
is
only
the
unknown
and
then
with
an
earnestness
i
can
not
describe
he
said
i
worship
him
i
know
not
unknown
whom
therefore
ye
worship
though
ye
know
him
not
him
declare
i
unto
you
one
could
only
press
home
god
own
answer
to
his
words
one
other
verse
held
him
in
its
power
before
i
went
i
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
with
those
two
verses
i
left
him
it
was
evening
and
he
stood
in
the
shadow
looking
into
it
there
was
a
tangle
of
undergrowth
and
a
heavy
grove
of
palms
it
was
all
dark
as
you
looked
in
behind
was
the
shrine
of
the
demon
steeds
the
god
and
his
wife
who
ride
out
at
night
to
chase
evil
spirits
away
near
by
was
an
old
tree
also
in
shade
with
an
idol
under
it
it
was
all
in
shadow
and
full
of
shadowy
nothings
all
dark
but
just
outside
when
i
went
there
was
light
the
soft
light
of
the
which
comes
soon
after
the
sun
has
set
as
a
sign
that
there
is
a
sun
somewhere
and
shining
and
i
thought
of
his
very
last
words
to
me
but
i
can
not
describe
the
earnestness
of
them
worship
the
unknown
friends
who
worship
a
god
whom
you
whose
joy
in
life
is
to
know
him
will
you
remember
and
pray
for
that
one
who
is
seeking
i
think
in
truth
to
find
the
unknown
god
chapter
xxviii
how
long
i
shivered
as
if
standing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
hell
martyn
i
have
come
home
from
vainly
trying
to
help
another
child
she
had
heard
of
the
children
saviour
and
i
think
she
would
have
come
to
him
but
they
suffered
her
not
she
was
when
i
first
saw
her
sweet
and
innocent
with
eyes
full
of
light
great
glancing
dancing
eyes
which
grew
wistful
for
a
moment
sometimes
and
then
filled
with
a
laugh
again
she
told
me
her
mother
lived
very
near
and
asked
me
to
come
and
see
her
so
i
went
the
mother
startled
me
such
a
face
or
such
a
want
of
a
face
one
was
looking
at
what
had
once
been
a
face
but
was
now
a
strange
spoiled
thing
with
strange
hard
eyes
so
unlike
the
child
there
was
no
other
feature
fully
shaped
it
was
one
dreadful
blank
she
listened
that
day
with
almost
eagerness
she
understood
so
quickly
too
one
felt
she
must
have
heard
before
but
she
told
us
nothing
about
herself
and
we
only
knew
that
there
was
something
very
wrong
her
surroundings
told
us
that
before
we
went
again
we
heard
who
she
was
a
relative
of
one
of
our
most
honoured
pastors
himself
a
convert
years
ago
then
a
great
longing
possessed
us
to
try
to
save
her
from
a
life
for
which
she
had
not
been
trained
and
especially
we
longed
to
save
her
little
girl
and
we
went
to
try
this
time
the
mother
welcomed
us
and
told
us
how
our
words
had
brought
back
things
she
had
heard
when
she
was
young
but
now
it
is
all
different
for
i
am
different
and
she
told
us
her
story
so
i
took
poison
but
it
acted
not
as
i
intended
only
destroyed
my
and
she
touched
the
poor
remnant
with
her
hand
and
went
on
with
her
terrible
tale
there
were
people
listening
outside
and
she
spoke
in
a
hoarse
whisper
we
could
hardly
believe
she
meant
what
she
said
as
she
told
of
the
fate
proposed
for
her
child
and
oh
how
we
besought
her
then
and
there
to
give
up
the
life
and
let
us
help
her
and
that
dear
little
one
she
seemed
moved
something
awoke
within
her
and
strove
tears
filled
those
hard
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
as
we
pleaded
with
her
in
the
name
of
all
that
was
motherly
not
to
doom
her
little
innocent
girl
not
to
push
her
with
her
own
hands
down
to
hell
at
last
she
yielded
promised
that
if
in
one
week
time
we
would
come
again
she
would
give
her
up
to
us
and
as
for
herself
she
would
think
of
it
and
perhaps
she
also
would
give
up
the
life
she
hated
it
she
said
there
was
another
girl
there
a
fair
quiet
girl
of
fifteen
she
was
ill
and
very
suffering
and
we
tried
for
her
too
but
there
seemed
no
hope
take
the
little
one
you
are
not
too
late
for
her
the
mother
said
and
we
went
with
the
promise
one
more
week
and
she
is
yours
the
week
passed
and
every
day
we
prayed
for
that
little
one
then
when
the
time
came
we
went
hope
and
fear
alternated
within
us
one
felt
sick
with
dread
lest
anything
had
happened
to
break
the
mother
word
and
yet
one
hoped
the
house
door
was
open
the
people
in
the
street
smiled
as
we
stopped
our
bandy
got
out
and
went
in
i
remembered
their
smiles
afterwards
and
understood
the
mother
was
there
in
a
corner
crouching
in
pain
was
the
girl
on
the
floor
asleep
lay
the
child
with
her
little
arms
stretched
out
the
mother
eyes
were
hard
it
was
no
use
outside
in
the
street
the
people
sat
on
their
verandahs
and
laughed
offer
twenty
thousand
rupees
and
see
if
her
mother
will
give
her
to
you
shouted
one
inside
we
sat
beside
that
mother
not
knowing
what
to
say
the
child
stirred
in
her
sleep
and
turned
will
you
go
said
the
mother
very
roughly
in
her
ear
she
opened
listless
senseless
eyes
she
had
no
wish
to
go
she
wanted
to
come
last
week
we
said
the
mother
hardened
and
pushed
the
child
and
rolled
her
over
with
her
foot
will
not
go
she
said
oh
it
did
seem
pitiful
one
of
those
pitiful
pitiful
things
which
never
grow
less
pitiful
because
they
are
common
everywhere
that
girl
and
this
we
took
the
mother
hands
in
ours
and
pleaded
once
again
and
then
words
failed
us
they
sometimes
do
there
are
things
that
stifle
words
at
last
they
asked
us
to
go
the
girl
in
the
corner
would
not
speak
could
not
perhaps
she
only
moaned
we
passed
her
and
went
out
the
mother
followed
us
half
sorry
for
us
there
is
something
of
the
woman
left
in
her
half
sullen
with
a
lowering
sullenness
you
will
never
see
her
again
she
said
and
she
named
the
town
one
of
the
sodoms
of
this
province
to
which
the
child
was
soon
to
be
sent
and
then
just
a
little
ashamed
of
her
broken
promise
she
added
i
would
have
let
her
go
but
would
not
no
never
and
she
does
not
belong
to
me
now
so
what
could
i
do
we
did
not
ask
her
who
he
was
we
knew
nor
did
we
ask
the
price
he
had
paid
we
knew
fifty
rupees
about
three
pounds
was
the
price
paid
down
for
a
younger
child
bought
for
the
same
purpose
not
long
ago
this
one
price
might
be
a
little
higher
that
is
all
we
stood
by
the
bullock
cart
ready
to
get
in
the
people
were
watching
the
mother
had
gone
back
into
the
house
then
a
great
wave
of
longing
for
that
child
swept
over
us
again
we
turned
and
looked
at
the
little
form
as
it
lay
on
the
floor
dead
as
it
seemed
to
all
outward
things
oh
that
it
had
been
dead
and
we
pleaded
once
more
with
all
our
heart
and
once
more
failed
we
drove
away
we
could
see
them
crowding
to
look
after
us
and
we
shut
our
eyes
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
their
smiles
the
bullock
bells
jingled
too
gladly
it
seemed
and
we
shut
our
ears
to
shut
out
the
sound
and
then
we
shut
ourselves
in
with
god
who
knew
all
about
it
and
cared
how
long
o
god
how
long
and
now
we
have
heard
that
she
has
gone
and
we
know
from
watching
what
happened
before
just
what
will
happen
now
how
day
by
day
they
will
sear
that

soul
with
irons
till
it
does
not
feel
or
care
any
more
and
a
child
seared
soul
is
an
awful
thing
forgive
us
for
words
which
may
hurt
and
shock
we
are
telling
the
hurt
or
not
shocked
or
not
should
you
not
know
the
truth
how
can
you
pray
as
you
ought
if
you
only
know
fragments
of

truth
is
a
loaf
you
may
cut
it
up
nicely
like
thin
bread
and
butter
with
all
the
crusts
carefully
trimmed
no
one
objects
to
it
then
or
you
can
cut
it
as
it
comes
crust
and
all
think
of
that
child
as
you
gather
your
children
about
you
and
look
in
their
innocent
faces
and
their
clear
frank
eyes
our
very
last
news
of
her
was
that
she
had
been
in
some
way
influenced
to
spread
a
lie
about
the
place
first
sign
of
the
searing
begun
i
think
of
her
as
i
saw
her
that
first
day
bright
as
a
bird
and
then
of
her
as
i
saw
her
last
drugged
on
the
floor
i
think
of
her
as
she
must
be
now
bright
again
but
with
a
different
brightness
not
the
little
girl
i
knew
never
to
be
quite
that
little
girl
again
oh
comrades
do
you
wonder
that
we
care
do
you
wonder
that
we
plead
with
you
to
care
do
you
wonder
that
we
have
no
words
sometimes
and
fall
back
into
silence
or
break
out
into
words
wrung
from
one
more
gifted
with
expression
who
knew
what
it
was
to
feel
with
such
words
then
we
close
looking
back
once
more
at
that
child
on
the
floor
with
the
hands
stretched
out
and
the
heavy
eyes
shut
and
we
know
what
it
was
they
saw
when
they
opened
from
that
sleep
my
god
can
such
things
be

thou
not
said

thy

thy
humblest

done

thee

the

how
long
chapter
xxix
what
do
we
count
them
worth
if
we
are
simply
to
pray
to
the
extent
of
a
simple
and
pleasant
and
enjoyable
exercise
and
know
nothing
of
watching
in
prayer
and
of
weariness
in
prayer
we
shall
not
draw
down
the
blessing
that
we
may
we
shall
not
sustain
our
missionaries
who
are
overwhelmed
with
the
appalling
darkness
of
heathenism
we
must
serve
god
even
to
the
point
of
suffering
and
each
one
ask
himself
in
what
degree
in
what
point
am
i
extending
by
personal
suffering
by
personal
to
the
point
of
pain
the
kingdom

it
is

true

hudson
taylor
she
picked
up
her
and
stood
surveying
us
somewhat
curiously
the
ways
of
missie
ammals
were
beyond
her
afterwards
she
sat
down
comfortably
and
talked
that
was
a
year
ago
then
in
the
evening
she
and
all
her
neighbours
gathered
in
the
market
square
for
the
meeting
shining
of
life
spoke
for
the
first
time
i
was
a
hindu
a
year
ago
i
worshipped
the
gods
you
worship
did
they
hear
me
when
i
prayed
no
they
are
dead
gods
god
is
the
living
god
come
to
the
living
god
one
after
the
other
the
boys
all
witnessed
that
evening
their
clear
boyish
voices
rang
out
round
the
ring
and
some
listened
and
some
laughed
illustration
she
picked
up
her
and
stood
surveying
us
somewhat
curiously
behind
us
there
was
a
little
demon
temple
it
had
a
verandah
barred
down
with
heavy
bars
within
these
bars
you
could
see
the
form
of
an
idol
beside
us
there
was
a
shrine
someone
had
put
our
lanterns
on
the
top
of
this
pyramid
shrine
before
us
there
was
the
mass
of
dark
faces
behind
us
then
black
walls
black
bars
a
black
shape
before
us
the
black
meeting
black
losing
itself
in
black
around
us
light
light
shining
into
the
black
that
was
as
it
was
a
year
ago
now
we
are
back
at
dohnavur
and
almost
the
first
place
we
went
to
was
this
village
where
we
had
taken
the
light
and
set
it
up
in
the
heart
of
the
dark
an
earnest
young
schoolmaster
had
been
sent
to
keep
that
light
burning
there
and
we
went
expectantly
had
the
light
spread
we
went
straight
to
our
old
friend
house
she
was
as
friendly
as
ever
in
her
queer
rough
country
way
but
her
heart
had
not
been
set
alight
tell
me
what
is
the
good
of
your
way
will
it
fill
the
cavity
within
me
and
she
struck
herself
a
resounding
smack
in
the
region
where
food
is
supposed
to
go
will
it
stock
my
or
nourish
my
bulls
or
cause
my
palms
to
bear
good
juice
if
it
will
not
do
all
these
good
things
what
is
the
use
of
it
if
it
is
so
important
why
did
you
not
come
before
the
dear
old
woman
who
asked
that
lived
here
and
we
searched
through
the
labyrinthic
courtyards
to
find
her
but
failed
the
girl
who
listened
in
her
pain
is
well
now
but
she
says
the
desire
she
had
has
cooled
we
found
two
or
three
who
seem
lighting
up
may
god
wind
blow
the
flame
to
a
blaze
but
we
came
back
feeling
that
we
must
learn
more
of
the
power
of
prayer
ourselves
if
these
cold
souls
are
to
catch
fire
we
remembered
how
when
we
were
children
we
caught
the
sunlight
and
focussed
it
and
set
bits
of
paper
on
fire
and
we
longed
that
our
prayers
might
be
a
lens
to
focus
the
of
our
god
and
set
their
souls
on
fire
just
one
little
bit
of
encouragement
may
be
told
by
way
of
cheer
blessing
went
off
one
day
to
see
if
the
village
of
the
warrior
were
more
friendlily
inclined
and
golden
went
to
the
petra
where
they
vowed
they
would
never
let
us
in
before
blessing
entered
the
village
she
knelt
down
under
a
banyan
tree
and
remembering
abraham
servant
prayed
for
a
sign
to
strengthen
her
faith
that
god
would
work
in
the
place
while
she
prayed
a
child
came
and
looked
at
her
then
seeing
her
pray
she
said
has
that
missie
ammal
sent
you
who
came
here
more
than
a
year
ago
blessing
said
yes
then
the
child
repeated
the
chorus
we
had
taught
the
children
that
first
day
none
of
us
forget
she
said
and
told
blessing
how
the
parents
had
agreed
to
allow
us
to
teach
if
ever
we
should
return
the
village
had
been
opened
he
goeth
before
golden
experience
was
equally
strengthening
to
our
faith
in
the
very
street
where
they
held
a
public
demonstration
to
cleanse
the
road
defiled
by
our
presence
twenty
houses
have
opened
where
she
is
a
welcome
visitor
but
all
this
is
only
for
love
sake
they
say
they
do
not
yet
want
christ
so
let
us
focus
the
light
then
there
is
need
for
the
fire
of
god
to
burn
the
cords
that
hold
souls
down
there
is
one
with
whom
the
spirit
strove
last
year
when
we
were
here
but
a
cord
of
sin
was
twined
round
her
soul
she
has
a
wicked
and
a
still
more
wicked
sister
and
together
they
plotted
so
evil
a
plot
that
heathen
though
she
is
she
recoiled
and
indignantly
refused
so
they
quietly
drugged
her
food
and
did
as
they
chose
with
her
and
now
the
knot
she
did
not
tie
and
which
she
wholly
detested
at
first
seems
doubly
knotted
by
her
own
will
oh
to
know
better
how
to
use
the
of
prayer
there
may
be
a
certain
amount
of
sentiment
theoretically
at
least
in
breaking
up
new
ground
the
unknown
holds
possibilities
and
it
allures
one
on
but
in
retracing
the
track
there
is
nothing
whatever
of
this
the
broad
daylight
of
bare
truth
shows
you
everything
just
as
it
is
will
you
look
once
more
at
things
just
as
they
are
though
it
is
not
an
interesting
look
a
courtyard
where
the
women
have
often
heard
may
we
come
in
oh
yes
come
in
but
with
us
in
comes
an
old
fakeer
of
a
specially
villainous
type
his
body
is
plastered
all
over
with
mud
he
has
nothing
on
but
mud
his
hair
is
matted
and
powdered
with
ashes
his
face
is
daubed
with
vermilion
and
yellow
his
wicked
old
eyes
squint
viciously
and
he
shows
all
his
teeth
crimson
with
betel
and
snarls
his
various
wants
the
women
say
chee
then
he
rolls
in
the
dust
and
squirms
and
wriggles
and
howls
and
he
pours
out
such
unclean
vials
of
wrath
that
the
women
coerced
give
him
all
he
demands
and
he
rolls
off
elsewhere
now
may
we
read
to
the
women
no
many
salaams
but
they
have
no
time
last
night
there
was
a
royal
row
between
two
friends
in
adjoining
courtyards
and
family
histories
were
laid
bare
and
pedigrees
discovered
they
are
discussing
these
things
and
having
heard
it
all
before
they
have
no
time
to
read
another
courtyard
more
refined
here
the
fakeer
opposite
a
dignified
ascetic
sits
in
silent
meditation
we
know
it
all
you
told
us
before
but
the
women
are
friendly
and
we
go
in
and
after
a
long
and
earnest
talk
the
grandmother
touches
her
rosary
this
is
my
ladder
to
heaven
the
berries
are
fine
and
set
in
chased
gold
but
they
are
only
solidified
tears
tears
shed
in
wrath
by
their
god
they
say
which
resolved
themselves
into
these
berries
how
can
tears
make
ladders
to
heaven
she
does
not
know
she
does
not
care
and
a
laugh
runs
round
but
one
heart
does
not
laugh
such
ladders
are
dangerous
another
house
here
the
men
are
kind
and
freely
let
us
in
and
out
the
way
they
say
is
very
good
they
have
heard
the
iyer
preach
but
one
day
there
is
a
stir
in
the
house
one
of
the
sons
is
very
ill
he
has
been
suffering
for
some
time
now
he
is
suddenly
getting
worse
and
suspicions
are
aroused
then
the
women
whisper
the
truth
the
father
and
he
are
at
daggers
drawn
and
the
father
is
slowly
poisoning
him
small
doses
of
strychnine
are
doing
the
work
the
stir
is
not
very
violent
but
quite
sufficient
to
make
an
excuse
for
not
wanting
to
listen
well
this
sort
of
thing
throws
us
back
upon
god
lord
teach
us
to
pray
teach
us
the
real
secret
of
fiery
fervency
in
prayer
we
know
so
little
of
it
lord
teach
us
to
pray
amma
amma
do
not
pray
your
prayers
are
troubling
me
we
all
looked
up
in
astonishment
we
had
just
had
our
band
prayer
meeting
when
a
woman
came
rushing
into
the
room
and
began
to
exclaim
like
this
she
was
the
mother
of
one
of
our
girls
of
whom
i
told
you
once
before
she
is
still
in
the
terrible
den
now
the
mother
was
all
excitement
and
poured
out
a
curious
story
when
you
went
away
last
year
i
prayed
i
prayed
and
prayed
and
prayed
again
to
my
god
to
dispel
your
work
my
daughter
heart
was
impressed
with
your
words
i
cried
to
my
god
to
wash
the
words
out
has
he
washed
them
out
oh
no
and
i
prayed
for
a
bridegroom
and
one
came
and
the
cart
was
ready
to
take
her
away
and
a
hindrance
occurred
the
marriage
fell
through
and
i
wept
till
my
eyes
dissolved
and
again
another
bridegroom
came
and
again
an
obstacle
occurred
and
yet
again
did
a
bridegroom
come
and
yet
again
an
obstacle
and
i
can
not
get
my
daughter
and
the
neighbours
mock
and
my
caste
is
disgraced
and
the
poor
old
mother
cried
just
sobbed
in
her
shame
and
confusion
of
face
then
i
went
to
my
god
again
and
said
more
can
i
offer
you
have
i
not
given
you
all
i
have
and
you
reject
my
prayer
then
in
a
dream
my
god
appeared
and
he
said
the
christians
not
to
pray
i
can
do
nothing
against
their
prayers
their
prayers
are
hindering
me
and
so
i
beseech
you
stop
your
prayers
for
fourteen
days
only
fourteen
days
till
i
get
my
daughter
tied
and
after
she
is
tied
we
asked
oh
then
she
may
freely
follow
your
god
i
will
hinder
her
no
more
poor
old
mother
all
lies
are
allowed
where
such
things
are
concerned
we
knew
the
proposed
bridegroom
came
from
a
place
three
hundred
miles
distant
and
the
idea
was
to
carry
the
poor
girl
off
by
force
as
soon
as
she
was
tied
we
have
been
praying
night
and
day
to
god
to
hinder
this
and
he
is
hindering
but
there
is
need
to
go
on
that
mother
is
a
devotee
she
has
received
the
afflatus
sometimes
at
night
it
falls
upon
her
and
she
dances
the
wild
wicked
dance
and
tries
to
seize
the
girl
who
shrinks
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
little
house
and
she
dances
round
her
and
chants
the
chant
which
even
in
daylight
has
power
in
it
but
which
at
night
appeals
unspeakably
once
the
girl
almost
gave
way
and
then
in
her
desperation
hardly
knowing
the
sin
of
it
ran
to
the
place
where
poison
was
kept
drank
enough
to
kill
two
straight
off
then
lay
down
on
the
floor
to
die
better
die
than
do
what
they
wanted
her
to
do
she
thought
but
they
found
out
what
she
had
done
and
drastic
means
were
immediately
used
and
the
poison
only
made
her
ill
and
caused
her
days
of
violent
pain
so
there
is
need
for
the
hindering
prayer
lord
teach
us
how
to
pray
is
india
crammed
with
the
horrible
picturesque
they
call
it
who
have
done
it
in
a
month
or
two
and
written
a
book
to
describe
it
and
the
most
picturesque
part
they
agree
is
connected
with
the
temples
india
ends
off
in
a
pointed
rock
you
can
stand
at
the
very
point
of
the
rock
with
only
ocean
before
you
and
almost
all
asia
behind
a
temple
is
set
at
the
end
of
the
point
as
if
claiming
the
land
for
its
own
we
took
our
convert
boys
and
girls
to
the
cape
for
the
christmas
holidays
and
one
morning
some
of
us
spent
an
hour
under
an
old
wall
near
the
temple
which
wall
being
full
of
hermit
crabs
is
very
interesting
we
were
watching
the
entertaining
ways
of
these
degenerate
creatures
when
through
the
soft
sea
sounds
we
heard
the
sound
of
a
brahman
voice
and
looking
up
saw
this
a
little
group
of
five
sitting
between
the
rocks
and
the
sea
giving
a
touch
of
life
to
the
scene
and
making
the
picture
perfect
there
were
two
men
a
woman
a
child
and
the
priest
they
were
all
marked
with
the
vishnu
mark
the
priest
twined
the
sacred
kusa
grass
round
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
and
gave
each
a
handful
of
grass
and
they
did
as
he
had
done
then
they
strewed
the
grass
on
the
sand
to
purify
it
from
taint
of
earth
and
then
they
began
the
priest
chanted
names
of
god
then
stopped
and
drew
signs
on
the
sand
they
followed
him
exactly
then
they
bathed
bowing
to
the
east
between
each
dip
and
worshipping
then
returned
and
repeated
it
all
but
before
repeating
it
they
carefully
painted
the
marks
on
their
foreheads
using
white
and
red
pigment
and
consulting
a
small
english
hand
mirror
the
one
incongruous
bit
of
west
in
this
east
but
symbolical
of
the
times
the
child
followed
it
all
as
a
child
will
in
its
pretty
way
she
was
a
dainty
little
thing
in
a
crimson
seeley
and
many
gold
jewels
the
elder
woman
was
dressed
in
dark
green
the
colouring
was
a
joy
to
the
eye
crimson
and
green
and
the
brown
of
the
rock
against
the
blue
of
the
sea
it
was
one
of
those
exquisite
mornings
we
often
have
in
the
tropics
when
everything
everywhere
shows
you
god
shines
the
word
out
like
a
word
illumined
sings
it
out
in
the
universe
song
and
here
in
this
south
niche
of
nature
cathedral
under
the
sky
transparency
these
five
in
the
only
way
they
knew
acknowledged
the
presence
of
one
great
god
and
worshipped
him
there
was
nothing
revolting
here
no
hint
of
repulsive
idolatry
they
worshipped
the
unseen
very
stately
the
sanscrit
sounded
in
which
they
chanted
their
adoration
king
of
immensity
king
of
eternity
boundless
endless
infinite
one
it
might
have
been
the
echo
of
some
ancient
christian
hymn
it
might
have
been
but
it
was
not
they
are
not
worshipping
god
the
lord
might
be
but
they
are
whose
is
the
responsibility
is
it
partly
yours
and
mine
the
beauty
of
the
scene
has
passed
from
us
the
blue
of
the
blue
sky
is
blotted
out
only
like
souls
i
see
the
folk
thereunder
bound
who
should
conquer
slaves
who
should
be
kings
hearing
their
one
hope
with
an
empty
wonder
sadly
contented
with
a
show
of
things
then
with
a
rush
the
intolerable
craving
shivers
throughout
me
like
a
trumpet
call
oh
to
save
these
to
perish
for
their
saving
die
for
their
life
be
offered
for
them
all
the
picture
is
made
of
souls
souls
to
be
saved
oh
to
save
these
to
perish
for
their
saving
that
is
what
the
picture
says
picture
there
is
no
picture
in
the
place
where
it
was
there
is
simply
a
pain
world
and
god
dishonoured
in
it
oh
to
see
these
people
as
souls
refined
or
vulgar
beautiful
or
horrible
or
just
dull
oh
to
see
them
only
as
souls
and
to
yearn
over
them
and
pray
for
them
as
souls
who
must
live
eternally
somewhere
and
for
whom
each
of
us
in
our
measure
is
responsible
to
god
do
you
say
we
are
not
responsible
for
those
particular
souls
who
said
that
sort
of
thing
first
where
we
disavow
being
keeper
to
our
brother
we
his
cain
if
we
are
not
responsible
why
do
we
take
the
responsibility
of
appealing
to
them
in
impassioned
poetry
let
every
kindred
every
tribe
on
this
terrestrial
ball
to
him
all
majesty
ascribe
and
crown
him
lord
of
all
what
is
the
point
of
telling
people
to
do
a
certain
thing
if
we
have
no
concern
in
whether
they
do
it
or
not
the
angels
and
the
martyrs
and
the
saints
to
whom
we
appealed
before
have
crowned
him
long
ago
our
singing
to
them
on
the
subject
will
make
no
difference
either
way
but
when
we
turn
to
every
kindred
and
tribe
the
case
alters
how
can
they
crown
him
lord
of
all
when
they
do
not
know
about
him
why
do
they
not
know
about
him
because
we
have
not
told
them
it
is
true
that
many
whom
we
have
told
heard
their
one
hope
with
an
empty
wonder
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
true
that
the
everlasting
song
rises
fuller
because
of
those
who
out
in
this
dark
heathendom
heard
and
responded
and
crowned
him
king
but
singing
hymns
from
a
distance
will
never
save
souls
by
god
grace
coming
and
giving
and
praying
will
are
we
prepared
for
this
or
would
we
rather
sing
searcher
of
hearts
turn
thy
upon
us
are
we
coming
giving
praying
it
are
we
praying
yea
agonising
in
prayer
or
is
prayer
but
a
pleasant
exercise
a
holy
relief
for
our
feelings
we
have
sat
together
under
the
wall
by
the
southern
sea
we
have
looked
at
the
five
as
they
worshipped
another
and
not
our
god
now
let
this
little
south
window
be
like
a
little
clear
pane
of
glass
through
which
you
may
look
up
far
to
the
north
over
the
border
countries
and
the
mountains
to
tibet
over

and
away
through
the
vastness
of
central

on
to
china
mongolia
manchuria
and
even
then
you
have
only
seen
a
few
of
the
great
dark
northern
lands
which
wait
and
wait
for
you
and
this
is
only
asia
only
a
part
of

god
looks
down
on
all
the
world
and
for
every
one
of
the
millions
who
have
never
crowned
him

christ
wore
the
crown

what
do
we
count

worth
do
we
count
them
worth
the
rearrangement
of
our
day
that
we
may
have
more
time
to
pray
do
we
count
them
worth
the
laying
down
of
a
single
ambition
the
loosening
of
our
hold
on

do
we
count

worth
the
yielding
up
of
anything
we
care
for
very
much

us

still

counted

we

chapter

two
safe
god
has
given
me
the
hunger
and
thirst
for
souls
will
he
leave
me
unsatisfied
no
verily
gilmour
that
one
soul
has
been
brought
to
christ
in
the
midst
of
such
hostile
influences
is
so
entirely
and
marvellously
the
holy
spirit
work
that
i
am
sometimes
overjoyed
to
have
been
in
any
degree
instrumental
in
effecting
the
emancipation
of
one
noble
two
of
our
boys
are
safe
they
left
us
very
suddenly
we
can
hardly
realise
they
are
gone
the
younger
one
was
our
special
boy
the
first
of
the
boys
to
come
a
very
dear
lad
i
think
of
him
as
i
saw
him
the
last
evening
we
all
spent
together
standing
out
on
a
rock
the
wind
in
his
hair
and
his
face
wet
with
spray
rejoicing
in
it
all
not
another
boy
dare
go
and
stand
in
the
midst
of
that
seething
foam
but
the
spice
of
danger
drew
him
he
was
such
a
thorough
boy
the
call
to
leave
his
home
for
christ
came
to
him
in
an
meeting
held
in
his
village
two
years
ago
then
there
was
bitterest
shame
to
endure
his
father
and
mother
aghast
and
distressed
did
all
they
could
to
prevent
the
disgrace
incurred
by
his
open
confession
of
christ
he
was
an
only
son
heir
to
considerable
property
so
the
matter
was
most
serious
the
father
loved
him
dearly
but
he
nerved
himself
to
flog
the
boy
and
twice
he
was
tied
up
and
flogged
but
they
say
he
never
wavered
only
his
mother
tears
he
found
hardest
to
withstand
weeks
passed
of
steadfast
confession
and
then
it
came
to
the
place
of
choice
between
christ
and
home
he
chose
christ
and
early
one
morning
left
all
to
follow
him
do
you
think
it
was
easy
he
was
a
loving
boy
could
it
have
been
easy
to
stab
his
mother
heart
when
the
household
woke
that
morning
he
was
on
his
way
to
us
the
father
gathered
his
clansmen
and
they
came
in
a
crowd
to
the
bungalow
they
sat
on
the
floor
in
a
circle
with
the
boy
in
their
midst
and
they
pleaded
i
remember
the
throb
of
that
moment
now
a
single
pulse
seemed
to
beat
in
the
room
so
tense
was
the
tension
until
he
spoke
out
bravely
i
will
not
go
back
he
said
they
promised
everything
a
house
lands
his
inheritance
to
be
given
at
once
a
wife
with
a
rich
dowry
of
jewels
all
a
tamil
boy
most
desires
they
offered
him
and
they
promised
him
freedom
to
worship
god
only
come
back
and
save
your
caste
and
do
not
break
your
mother
heart
and
disgrace
your
family
day
after
day
they
came
sometimes
singly
sometimes
in
groups
but
the
mother
never
came
they
described
her
in
language
she
neither
ate
nor
slept
they
said
but
sat
with
her
hair
undone
and
wept
and
wailed
the
for
her
son
at
last
they
gave
up
coming
and
we
were
relieved
for
the
strain
was
severe
and
though
he
never
wavered
we
knew
the
boy
felt
it
we
used
to
hear
him
praying
for
his
people
pouring
out
his
heart
when
he
thought
no
one
was
near
sobbing
sometimes
as
he
named
their
names
the
entreaty
in
the
tone
would
make
our
eyes
wet
if
only
he
could
have
lived
at
home
and
been
a
christian
there
but
we
knew
what
had
happened
to
others
and
we
dare
not
send
him
back
then
a
year
or
so
afterward
we
all
went
to
the
water
together
and
he
and
three
others
were
baptised
the
first
to
go
down
into
the
water
was
the
elder
boy
shining
of
victory
shining
of
life
was
second
a
few
weeks
of
bright
life
those
happy
days
by
the
sea
and
then
in
the
same
order
and
called
by
the
same
messenger
the
swift
indian
messenger
cholera
they
both
went
down
into
the
other
water
and
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
shining
of
life
was
well
in
the
morning
dead
in
the
evening
when
first
the
pain
seized
him
he
was
startled
then
understanding
he
lay
down
in
peace
the
heathen
crowded
in
they
could
not
be
kept
out
they
taunted
him
as
he
lay
this
is
your
reward
for
breaking
your
caste
they
said
the
agony
of
cholera
was
on
him
he
could
not
say
much
but
he
pointed
up
do
not
trouble
me
this
is
the
way
by
which
i
am
going
to
jesus
and
he
tried
to
sing
a
line
from
one
of
our
choruses
my
strength
and
my
redeemer
my
refuge
jesus
his
parents
had
been
sent
for
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
he
was
ill
they
hurried
over
the
poor
despairing
mother
crying
aloud
imploringly
to
the
gods
who
did
not
hear
he
pointed
up
again
he
was
almost
past
speech
then
but
he
tried
to
say
jesus
and
come
then
while
the
heathen
stood
and
mocked
and
the
mother
beat
her
breast
and
wailed
and
the
father
silent
in
his
grief
just
stood
and
looked
at
his
son
the
boy
passed
quietly
away
they
hardly
believed
him
dead
oh
we
miss
him
so
much
and
our
hearts
ache
for
his
people
for
they
mourn
as
those
who
have
no
hope
but
god
knows
why
he
took
him
we
know
it
is
all
right
every
memory
of
him
is
good
when
the
first
sharp
strain
was
over
we
found
what
a
thorough
boy
he
was
and
in
that
week
by
the
sea
all
the
life
and
fun
in
him
came
out
and
he
revelled
in
the
bathing
and
boating
and
threw
his
whole
heart
into
the
holiday
we
had
many
hopes
for
him
he
was
so
full
of
promise
and
the
energy
of
life
and
now
it
is
all
over
for
both
was
it
worth
the
pain
it
cost
such
a
short
time
to
witness
was
it
worth
while
it
is
true
it
was
very
short
most
of
the
little
space
between
their
coming
and
their
going
was
filled
with
preparation
for
a
future
of
service
here
and
yet
in
that
little
time
each
of
the
two
found
one
other
boy
who
perhaps
would
never
have
been
found
if
the
cost
had
been
counted
too
great
and
i
think
if
you
could
ask
them
now
they
would
tell
you
jesus
welcome
made
it
far
more
than
worth
while
chapter
xxxi
three
objections
may
i
have
grace
to
live
above
every
human
motive
simply
with
god
and
to
god
and
not
swayed
especially
in
missionary
work
by
the
opinions
of
people
not
acquainted
with
the
state
of
things
whose
judgment
may
be
contrary
to
my
own
martyn
these
letters
have
been
put
together
to
help
our
comrades
at
home
to
realise
something
of
the
nature
of
the
forces
ranged
against
us
that
they
may
bring
the
superhuman
to
bear
upon
the
superhuman
and
pray
with
an
intelligence
and
intensity
impossible
to
uninformed
faith
we
have
long
enough
the
might
of
the
actual
we
need
more
of
abraham
type
of
faith
which
without
being
weakened
considered
the
facts
and
then
looking
unto
the
promise
wavered
not
but
waxed
strong
ignorant
faith
does
not
help
us
much
some
years
ago
when
the
first
came
friends
wrote
rejoicing
that
now
the
wall
of
caste
must
give
way
they
expected
soon
to
hear
it
had
as
if
a
grain
of
dust
falling
from
one
of
the
bricks
in
that
wall
would
in
anywise
shake
the
wall
itself
such
faith
is
kind
but
there
it
ends
it
talks
of
what
it
knows
not
then
as
to
the
people
themselves
there
are
certain
fallacies
which
die
hard
we
read
the
other
day
in
a
home
paper
that
it
was
a
fact
that
indian
women
never
smile
we
were
surprised
to
hear
it
we
had
not
noticed
it
perhaps
if
they
were
one
and
all
so
abnormally
depressed
we
should
find
them
less
unwilling
to
welcome
the
glad
tidings
again
we
read
that
you
can
distinguish
between
heathen
and
christian
by
the
wonderful
light
on
the
christians
faces
as
compared
with
the
sad
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
poor
benighted
heathen
it
is
true
that
some
christians
are
really
illuminated
but
as
a
whole
the
heathen
are
so
remarkably
cheerful
that
the
difference
is
not
so
defined
as
one
might
think
then
again
we
read
in
descriptive
articles
on
india
that
the
weary
hopeless
longing
of
the
people
is
most
touching
but
we
find
that
our
chief
difficulty
is
to
get
them
to
believe
that
there
is
anything
to
long
for
rather
we
would
describe
them
as
those
who
think
they
have
need
of
nothing
knowing
not
that
they
have
need
of
everything
and
again
and
again
we
read
thrilling
descriptions
of
india
women
standing
with
their
hands
stretched
out
towards
god
they
may
do
this
in
visions
in
reality
they
do
not
and
it
is
the
utter
absence
of
all
this
sort
of
thing
which
makes
your
help
a
necessity
to
us
but
none
of
you
can
pray
in
the
way
we
want
you
to
pray
unless
the
mind
is
convinced
that
the
thing
concerning
which
such
prayer
is
asked
is
wholly
just
and
right
and
it
seems
to
us
that
many
of
those
who
have
followed
the
story
of
this
war
may
have
doubts
about
the
right
of
it
the
right
for
example
of
converts
leaving
their
homes
for
sake
and
his
gospel
all
will
be
in
sympathy
with
us
when
we
try
to
save
little
children
but
perhaps
some
are
out
of
sympathy
when
we
do
what
results
in
sorrow
and
misunderstanding
not
peace
but
a
sword
so
we
purpose
now
to
gather
up
into
three
some
of
the
many
objections
which
are
often
urged
upon
those
engaged
in
this
sort
of
work
because
we
feel
that
they
ought
to
be
faced
and
answered
if
possible
lest
we
lose
someone
prevailing
prayer
the
first
set
of
objections
may
be
condensed
into
a
question
as
to
the
right
or
otherwise
of
our
forcing
our
religion
upon
those
who
do
not
want
it
we
are
reminded
that
the
work
is
most
discouraging
conversions
are
rare
and
when
they
occur
they
seem
to
create
the
greatest
confusion
it
is
evident
enough
that
neither
we
nor
our
gospel
are
desired
and
no
wonder
when
the
conditions
of
discipleship
involve
so
much
should
not
like
strangers
to
come
and
interfere
with
our
religion
write
the
friends
who
object
and
draw
our
children
away
from
us
we
should
greatly
resent
it
no
wonder
the
hindus
do
and
one
reader
of
the
letters
wrote
that
she
wondered
how
the
girls
who
came
out
ever
could
be
happy
for
a
moment
after
having
done
such
a
wrong
and
heartless
thing
as
to
disobey
their
parents
they
richly
deserve
all
they
suffer
she
wrote
it
is
a
perfect
shame
and
disgrace
for
a
girl
to
desert
her
own
people
one
turns
from
the
reading
of
the
letter
and
looks
at
the
faces
of
those
who
have
done
it
and
knowing
how
they
need
every
bit
of
one
can
win
for
them
one
feels
it
will
be
worth
while
trying
to
show
those
who
blame
them
why
they
do
it
and
how
it
is
they
can
not
do
otherwise
if
they
would
be
true
to
christ
this
objection
as
to
the
right
or
wrong
of
the
work
as
a
whole
leads
to
another
relating
to
baptism
it
is
a
serious
thing
to
think
of
families
divided
upon
questions
of
religion
surely
it
would
be
better
that
a
convert
should
live
a
consistent
christian
life
at
home
even
without
baptism
than
that
she
should
break
up
the
peace
of
the
household
by
leaving
her
home
altogether
or
having
been
baptised
should
she
not
return
home
and
live
there
as
a
christian
lastly
and
this
comes
in
letters
from
those
who
more
than
any
are
in
sympathy
with
us
why
not
devote
our
energies
to
work
of
a
more
fruitful
character
we
are
reminded
of
the
type
of
work
in
which
nations
are
born
in
a
day
and
often
too
of
the
nominal
christians
who
sorely
need
more
enlightenment
why
not
work
along
the
line
of
least
resistance
where
conversion
to
god
does
not
of
necessity
mean
fire
and
sword
and
where
in
a
week
we
could
win
more
souls
than
in
years
of
this
unresultful
work
we
frankly
admit
that
these
objections
and
proposals
are
naturally
reasonable
and
that
what
they
state
is
perfectly
true
it
is
true
that
work
among
hindus
all
over
india
as
among
moslems
all
over
the
world
is
very
difficult
it
is
true
that
open
confession
of
christ
creates
disastrous
division
in
families
it
is
true
there
is
other
work
to
be
done
especially
we
feel
the
force
of
the
second
objection
raised
we
fully
recognise
that
the
right
thing
is
for
the
convert
to
live
among
her
own
people
and
let
her
light
shine
in
her
own
home
and
we
deplore
the
terrible
wrench
involved
in
what
is
known
as
coming
out
to
a
people
so
tenacious
of
custom
as
the
indians
are
to
a
nature
so
affectionate
as
the
indian
nature
is
this
cutting
across
of
all
home
ties
is
a
very
cruel
thing
and
now
only
that
we
may
not
miss
your
prayer
we
set
ourselves
to
try
to
answer
you
and
first
of
all
let
us
grasp
this
fact
it
is
not
fair
nor
is
it
wise
to
compare
work
and
success
in
work
between
one
set
of
people
and
another
because
the
conditions
under
which
that
work
is
carried
on
are
different
and
the
unseen
forces
brought
to
bear
against
it
differ
in
character
and
in
power
there
is
sometimes
more
result
written
down
in
a
single
column
of
a
religious
weekly
than
is
to
be
found
in
the
pages
of
one
of
the
noblest
missionary
books
of
modern
days
the
threshold
of
central
or
take
two
typical
opposite
lives
moody
and
gilmour
moody
saw
more
in
a
day
than
gilmour
in
his
years
it
was
not
that
the
differed
both
knew
the
baptism
of
power
both
lived
in
christ
and
loved
but
these
are
extremes
in
comparison
take
two
both
missionaries
twin
brothers
in
spirit
brainerd
of
north
america
and
henry
martyn
of
india
brainerd
saw
many
coming
to
jesus
martyn
hardly
one
each
was
a
pioneer
missionary
each
was
a
flame
of
fire
now
let
me
burn
out
for
god
wrote
henry
martyn
and
he
did
it
but
the
conditions
under
which
each
worked
varied
as
widely
spiritually
as
they
varied
climatically
can
we
compare
their
work
or
measure
it
by
its
visible
results
god
let
us
leave
off
comparing
this
with
that
we
do
not
know
enough
to
compare
let
us
leave
off
weighing
eternal
things
and
balancing
souls
in
earthly
scales
only
god
scales
are
sufficiently
sensitive
for
such
delicate
work
as
that
we
take
up
the
objections
one
by
one
first
do
you
go
where
you
are
not
wanted
we
go
because
we
believe
our
master
told
us
to
go
he
said
all
the
world
and
every
creature
our
marching
orders
are
very
familiar
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
all
the
world
means
everywhere
in
it
every
creature
means
everyone
in
it
these
orders
are
so
explicit
that
there
is
no
room
to
question
what
they
mean
all
missionaries
in
all
ages
have
so
understood
these
words
all
and
every
nearly
seven
hundred
years
ago
the
first
missionary
to
the
moslems
found
no
welcome
only
a
prison
but
he
never
doubted
he
was
sent
to
them
wills
he
said
and
went
again
they
stoned
him
then
and
he
died
died
but
never
doubted
he
was
sent
our
master
himself
went
not
only
to
the
common
people
who
heard
him
gladly
but
to
the
priestly
and
political
classes
who
had
no
desire
for
the
truth
ye
will
not
come
to
me
that
ye
might
have
life
he
said
and
yet
he
gave
them
the
chance
to
come
by
going
to
them
the
words
if
any
man
thirst
let
him
come
unto
me
and
drink
were
spoken
to
an
audience
which
was
not
thirsting
for
the
gospel
paul
would
willingly
have
spent
his
strength
preaching
the
word
in
asia
especially
in
galatia
where
the
people
loved
him
well
but
he
was
under
orders
and
he
went
to
europe
to
philippi
where
he
was
put
in
prison
to
thessalonica
where
the
opposition
was
so
strong
that
he
had
to
flee
away
by
night
to
athens
where
he
was
the
butt
of
the
philosophers
but
god
gave
souls
in
each
of
these
places
only
a
few
in
comparison
to
the
great
indifferent
crowd
but
he
would
tell
you
those
few
were
worth
going
for
you
would
not
have
had
him
miss
a
lydia
a
damaris
above
all
you
would
not
have
had
him
disobey
his
command
so
whether
our
message
is
welcomed
or
not
the
fact
remains
we
must
go
to
all
and
the
worse
they
are
and
the
harder
they
are
the
more
evident
is
it
that
wanted
or
not
it
is
by
them
coillard
was
robbed
by
the
people
he
had
travelled
far
to
find
you
see
we
made
no
mistake
he
writes
in
bringing
the
gospel
to
the
zambesi
the
second
objection
is
break
up
families
by
insisting
on
baptism
as
sine
quâ
non
discipleship
and
again
we
answer
because
we
believe
our
master
tells
us
to
he
said
baptising
them
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
what
right
have
we
his
servants
to
stop
short
of
full
obedience
did
he
not
know
the
conditions
of
hindu
life
in
india
when
he
gave
this
command
was
he
ignorant
of
the
breaking
up
of
families
which
obedience
to
it
would
involve
suppose
ye
that
i
am
come
to
give
peace
on
earth
i
tell
you
nay
but
rather
division
and
then
come
words
which
we
have
seen
lived
out
literally
in
the
case
of
every
convert
who
has
come
for
from
henceforth
there
shall
be
five
in
one
house
divided
three
against
two
and
two
against
three
the
father
shall
be
divided
against
the
son
and
the
son
against
the
father
the
mother
against
the
daughter
and
the
daughter
against
the
mother
the
against
her
and
the
against
her
these
are
truly
verses
no
one
knows
better
than
the
missionary
how
awful
they
are
there
are
times
when
we
can
hardly
bear
the
pain
caused
by
the
sight
of
this
division
but
are
we
more
tender
than
the
tender
one
is
our
sympathy
truer
than
his
can
we
look
up
into
his
eyes
and
say
it
costs
them
too
much
lord
it
costs
us
too
much
to
fully
obey
thee
in
this
but
granted
the
command
holds
why
should
not
the
baptised
convert
return
home
and
live
there
because
he
is
not
wanted
there
a
exceptions
to
this
rule
are
rare
we
are
speaking
of
caste
hindus
and
can
usually
be
explained
by
some
extenuating
circumstance
the
woman
who
said
to
us
i
can
not
live
here
and
break
my
caste
if
i
break
it
i
must
go
spoke
the
truth
keeping
caste
includes
within
itself
the
observance
of
certain
customs
which
by
their
very
nature
are
idolatrous
breaking
caste
means
breaking
through
these
customs
and
one
who
habitually
disregarded
and
disobeyed
rules
considered
binding
and
authoritative
by
all
the
rest
of
the
household
would
not
be
tolerated
in
an
orthodox
hindu
home
it
is
not
a
question
of
persecution
or
death
or
of
wanting
or
not
wanting
to
be
there
it
is
a
question
not
being
wanted
unless
indeed
she
will
compromise
compromise
is
the
one
open
door
back
into
the
old
home
and
god
only
knows
what
it
costs
when
the
choice
is
made
and
that
one
door
is
shut
this
reiteration
of
the
power
and
the
bondage
of
caste
may
seem
almost
wearisome
but
the
word
and
what
lies
behind
it
is
the
one
great
answer
to
a
thousand
questions
and
so
it
comes
again
and
again
in
southern
india
especially
and
still
more
so
in
this
little
fraction
of
it
and
in
the
adjoining
kingdoms
of
travancore
and
cochin
caste
feeling
is
so
strong
that
sometimes
it
is
said
that
caste
is
the
religion
of
south
india
but
everywhere
all
over
india
it
is
to
every
orthodox
hindu
part
of
his
very
self
get
his
caste
out
of
him
can
you
you
would
have
to
drain
him
of
his
first
it
is
the
strength
of
this
caste
spirit
which
in
south
india
causes
it
to
take
the
form
of
a
determination
to
get
the
convert
back
promises
are
given
that
they
may
live
as
christians
at
home
we
will
send
you
in
a
bandy
to
church
every
sunday
promises
given
to
be
broken
if
the
convert
is
a
boy
he
may
possibly
reappear
if
a
girl
i
was
going
to
say
but
i
remember
hearing
of
one
who
did
reappear
after
seventeen
years
imprisonment
a
wreck
send
them
back
do
you
say
think
of
the
dotted
lines
in
some
chapters
you
have
read
ponder
the
things
they
cover
then
send
them
back
if
you
can
the
third
objection
divides
into
two
halves
the
first
half
is
do
you
not
go
to
the
christians
to
which
we
answer
we
do
and
for
exactly
the
same
reason
as
that
which
we
have
given
twice
before
because
our
master
told
us
to
do
so
our
marching
orders
are
threefold
one
order
concerning
each
form
of
service
touched
by
the
three
objections
the
third
order
touches
this
teaching
them
to
observe
all
things
whatsoever
i
have
commanded
you
so
we
go
and
try
to
teach
them
the
all
things
and
some
of
them
learn
them
and
go
to
teach
others
and
so
the
message
of
a
full
gospel
spreads
and
the
bride
gets
ready
for
the
bridegroom
the
second
half
of
this
last
objection
is
not
do
easier
work
there
are
so
many
who
are
more
accessible
why
not
go
to
them
and
there
does
seem
to
be
point
in
the
suggestion
that
if
there
are
open
doors
it
might
be
better
to
enter
into
them
rather
than
keep
on
knocking
at
closed
ones
we
do
seek
to
enter
the
open
doors
but
we
never
find
they
are
so
very
wide
open
when
it
is
known
that
we
bring
nothing
tangible
with
us
spiritual
things
are
not
considered
anything
by
most
still
work
among
such
is
infinitely
easier
and
many
comparatively
speaking
are
doing
it
the
larger
number
here
are
working
among
the
christians
the
next
larger
number
among
the
masses
and
the
fewest
always
everywhere
among
the
classes
where
conversion
involves
such
terrible
conflicts
with
the
evil
one
that
all
that
is
human
in
one
faints
and
fails
as
it
confronts
the
cost
of
every
victory
but
real
conversion
anywhere
costs
by
conversion
we
mean
something
more
than
reformation
raises
fewer
storms
the
kind
of
work
however
which
more
than
any
other
seems
to
fascinate
friends
at
home
is
what
is
known
as
the
mass
movement
and
though
we
have
touched
upon
it
before
perhaps
we
had
better
explain
more
fully
what
it
really
is
this
movement
or
rather
the
visible
result
thereof
is
often
dilated
upon
most
rapturously
i
quote
from
a
winter
visitor
christian
churches
counted
by
the
thousand
their
members
by
the
million
whole
districts
are
christian
entire
communities
are
transformed
and
we
look
at
one
another
and
ask
each
other
where
but
to
that
question
certain
would
answer
joyously
here
there
are
missions
in
india
where
the
avowed
policy
is
to
baptise
people
at
the
outset
not
on
evidence
of
what
is
popularly
called
conversion
we
baptise
them
the
baptism
of
the
holy
spirit
and
not
because
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
they
have
received
the
baptism
we
quote
a
leader
in
the
movement
and
he
goes
on
to
say
if
it
is
insisted
that
we
should
wait
until
this
change
conversion
is
effected
before
baptising
them
we
reply
that
in
most
cases
we
would
have
to
wait
for
a
long
time
and
often
see
the
poor
creatures
die
without
the
change
of
course
every
effort
is
made
by
revival
services
and
camp
meetings
to
bring
these
baptised
christians
to
a
true
knowledge
of
christ
and
it
is
considered
that
this
policy
yields
more
fruit
than
the
other
which
puts
conversion
first
and
baptism
second
it
is
certainly
richer
in
results
for
among
the
depressed
classes
and
certain
of
the
middle
castes
among
whom
alone
the
scheme
can
be
carried
out
there
is
no
doubt
that
many
are
found
ready
to
embrace
christianity
as
the
phrase
goes
sometimes
genuinely
feeling
it
is
the
true
religion
and
desiring
to
understand
it
sometimes
for
what
they
can
get
it
must
be
admitted
for
we
want
to
state
the
case
fairly
that
a
mass
movement
gives
one
a
splendid
chance
to
preach
christ
and
teach
his
gospel
day
by
day
and
the
power
in
it
does
lay
hold
of
some
we
have
earnest
men
and
women
working
and
winning
others
fruit
of
the
mass
movement
of
many
years
ago
but
on
the
whole
we
fear
it
and
do
not
encourage
it
here
the
dead
weight
of
heathenism
is
heavy
enough
but
when
you
pile
on
the
top
of
that
the
incubus
of
a
dead
christianity
for
a
nominal
thing
is
dead
then
you
are
terribly
weighted
down
and
handicapped
as
you
try
to
go
forward
to
break
up
new
ground
so
though
we
sympathise
with
everything
that
tends
towards
life
and
light
in
india
and
rejoice
with
our
brothers
who
bind
sheaves
believing
that
though
all
is
not
genuine
corn
some
is
yet
we
feel
compelled
to
give
ourselves
mainly
to
work
of
a
character
which
by
its
very
nature
can
never
be
popular
and
possibly
never
successful
from
a
statistical
point
of
view
never
till
the
king
comes
whose
coming
is
our
hope
chapter
xxxii
show
me
thy
glory
yesterday
i
was
called
to
see
a
patient
a
young
woman
who
had
been
suffering
terribly
for
three
days
it
was
the
saddest
case
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
i
had
to
leave
her
to
die
the
experience
was
such
a
terrible
one
that
old
and
accustomed
surgeon
as
i
am
i
have
been
quite
upset
by
it
ever
since
as
long
as
i
live
the
memory
of
that
scene
will
cling
to
me
chinese
if
we
refuse
to
be
corns
of
wheat
falling
into
the
ground
and
dying
if
we
will
neither
sacrifice
prospects
nor
risk
character
and
property
and
health
nor
when
we
are
called
relinquish
home
and
break
family
ties
for
christ
sake
and
his
gospel
then
we
shall
abide
alone
gajetan
ragland
not
mere
pity
for
dead
souls
but
a
passion
for
the
glory
of
god
is
what
we
need
to
hold
us
on
to
victory
lilias
trotter
we
are
all
familiar
with
the
facts
and
figures
which
stand
for
so
much
more
than
we
realise
we
can
repeat
glibly
enough
that
there
are
nearly
one
thousand
five
hundred
million
people
in
the
world
and
that
of
these
nearly
one
thousand
million
are
heathen
or
mohammedan
perhaps
we
can
divide
this
unthinkable
mass
into
comprehensible
figures
we
can
tell
everyone
who
is
interested
in
hearing
it
that
of
this
one
thousand
million
two
hundred
million
are
mohammedans
two
hundred
million
more
are
hindus
four
hundred
and
thirty
million
are
buddhists
and
confucianists
and
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
million
are
pagans
but
have
we
ever
stopped
and
let
the
awfulness
of
these
statements
bear
down
upon
us
do
we
take
in
that
we
are
talking
about
immortal
souls
we
quote
someone
computation
that
every
day
thousand
people
die
without
christ
have
we
ever
for
one
hour
sat
and
thought
about
it
have
we
thought
of
it
for
half
an
hour
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
five
unbroken
minutes
i
go
further
and
i
ask
you
have
you
ever
sat
still
for
one
whole
minute
and
counted
by
the
ticking
of
your
watch
while
soul
after
soul
passes
out
alone
into
eternity
i
have
done
it
it
is
awful
at
the
lowest
computation
for
whom
christ
died
have
died
since
i
wrote
eternity
oh
my
god
my
god
men
are
perishing
and
i
take
no
heed
more
have
gone
oh
how
can
one
keep
so
calm
death
seems
racing
with
the
minute
hand
of
my
watch
i
feel
like
stopping
that
terrible
run
of
the
minute
hand
round
and
round
it
goes
and
every
time
it
goes
round
people
die
i
have
just
heard
of
the
dying
of
one
of
the
we
knew
her
well
she
was
a
widow
she
had
no
protectors
and
an
unprotected
widow
in
india
stands
in
a
dangerous
place
we
knew
it
and
tried
to
persuade
her
to
take
refuge
in
jesus
she
listened
almost
decided
then
drew
back
afterwards
we
found
out
why
you
have
seen
the
picture
of
a
man
sucked
under
sea
by
an
octopus
it
was
like
that
you
have
imagined
the
it
was
like
that
but
it
all
went
on
under
the
surface
of
the
water
there
was
nothing
seen
above
till
perhaps
a
bubble
rose
slowly
and
broke
it
was
like
that
one
day
in
the
broad
noontide
a
woman
suddenly
fell
in
the
street
someone
carried
her
into
a
house
but
she
was
dead
and
those
who
saw
that
body
saw
the
marks
of
the
struggle
upon
it
the
village
life
flowed
on
as
before
only
a
few
who
knew
her
knew
she
had
murdered
her
body
to
cover
the
murder
of
her
soul
we
had
come
too
late
for
her
last
week
i
stood
in
a
house
where
another
of
those
had
passed
crouching
on
the
floor
with
her
knees
drawn
up
and
her
head
on
her
knees
a
woman
began
to
tell
me
about
it
she
was
my
younger
sister
my
mother
gave
us
to
two
brothers
and
she
stopped
i
knew
who
the
brothers
were
i
had
seen
them
yesterday
two
handsome
hindus
we
had
visited
their
wives
little
knowing
the
woman
said
no
more
she
could
not
she
just
shuddered
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
a
neighbour
finished
the
story
something
went
wrong
with
the
girl
they
called
in
the
barber
wife
the
only
woman
doctor
known
in
these
parts
she
did
her
business
ignorantly
the
girl
died
in
fearful
pain
hindu
women
are
inured
to
sickening
sights
but
this
girl
death
was
so
terrible
that
the
elder
sister
has
never
recovered
from
the
shock
of
seeing
it
there
she
sits
they
tell
me
all
day
long
crouching
on
the
floor
mute
all
do
not
pass
like
that
some
pass
very
quietly
there
are
no
bands
in
their
death
and
some
are
innocent
children
thank
god
for
the
comfort
of
that
but
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
the
heathen
sin
against
the
light
they
have
their
lives
witness
against
them
they
know
they
sin
and
they
fear
death
an
indian
christian
doctor
practising
in
one
of
our
hindu
towns
told
me
that
he
could
not
speak
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
at
the
deathbeds
of
some
of
his
patients
a
girl
came
in
a
moment
ago
and
i
told
her
what
i
was
doing
then
i
showed
her
the
diagram
of
the
wedge
the
great
black
disc
for
heathendom
and
the
narrow
white
slit
for
the
converts
won
she
looked
at
it
amazed
then
she
slowly
traced
her
finger
round
the
disc
and
she
pointed
to
the
narrow
slit
and
her
tears
came
dropping
down
on
it
oh
what
must
jesus
feel
she
said
what
must
jesus
feel
she
is
only
a
common
village
girl
she
has
been
a
christian
only
a
year
but
it
touched
her
to
the
quick
to
see
that
great
black
blot
i
know
there
are
those
who
care
at
home
but
do
all
who
care
care
deeply
enough
do
they
feel
as
jesus
feels
and
if
they
do
are
they
giving
their
own
they
are
helping
to
send
out
others
perhaps
but
are
they
giving
their
own
are
they
truly
giving
themselves
there
must
be
more
giving
of
ourselves
if
that
wedge
is
to
be
widened
in
the
disc
some
who
care
are
young
and
life
is
all
before
them
and
the
question
that
presses
now
is
this
where
is
that
life
to
be
spent
some
are
too
old
to
come
but
they
have
those
whom
they
might
send
if
only
they
would
strip
themselves
for
jesus
sake
mothers
and
fathers
have
you
sympathy
with
jesus
are
you
willing
to
be
lonely
for
a
few
brief
years
that
all
through
eternal
ages
he
may
have
more
over
whom
to
rejoice
and
you
with
him
he
may
be
coming
very
soon
and
the
little
interval
that
remains
holds
our
last
chance
certainly
to
suffer
for
his
sake
and
possibly
our
last
to
win
jewels
for
his
crown
oh
the
unworked
of
heathendom
oh
the
joy
his
own
are
missing
if
they
lose
this
one
last
chance
sometimes
we
think
that
if
the
need
were
more
clearly
seen
something
more
would
be
done
means
would
be
devised
two
or
three
would
live
together
so
as
to
save
expenses
and
set
a
child
free
who
must
otherwise
stay
for
the
sake
of
one
of
the
three
workers
abroad
can
live
together
sinking
self
and
its
likes
and
dislikes
for
the
sake
of
the
cause
that
stands
first
but
if
such
an
innovation
is
impossible
at
home
something
else
will
be
planned
by
which
more
will
be
spared
when
those
who
love
our
god
love
him
well
enough
to
put
his
interests
first
worthy
is
the
lamb
to
receive
oh
we
say
it
and
we
pray
it
do
we
act
as
if
we
meant
it
fathers
and
mothers
is
he
not
worthy
givers
who
have
given
your
all
have
you
not
found
him
worthy
bare
figures
overwhelmed
me
said
one
as
he
told
how
he
had
been
led
to
come
out
i
was
fairly
staggered
as
i
read
that
thousand
a
day
in
india
alone
go
to
their
death
without
christ
and
i
questioned
do
we
believe
it
do
we
really
believe
it
what
narcotic
has
satan
injected
into
our
systems
that
this
awful
woeful
tremendous
fact
does
not
startle
us
out
of
our
lethargy
our
frightful
neglect
of
human
souls
there
is
a
river
flowing
through
this
district
it
rises
in
the
western
ghauts
and
flows
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
a
placid
shallow
stream
but
when
the
monsoon
rains
overflow
the
watersheds
it
fills
with
a
sudden
magnificent
rush
you
can
hear
it
a
mile
away
out
in
the
sandy
river
bed
a
number
of
high
stone
platforms
are
built
which
are
used
by
travellers
as
when
the
river
is
low
some
years
ago
a
party
of
labourers
being
belated
decided
to
sleep
on
one
of
these
platforms
for
though
the
rainy
season
was
due
the
river
was
very
low
but
in
the
night
the
river
rose
it
swept
them
on
their
hold
on
the
stone
it
whirled
them
down
in
the
dark
to
the
sea
suppose
that
knowing
as
they
did
not
that
the
rain
had
begun
to
fall
on
the
hills
and
the
river
was
sure
to
fill
you
had
chanced
to
pass
when
those
labourers
were
settling
down
for
the
night
would
you
you
have
passed
on
content
without
an
effort
to
tell
them
so
would
you
you
have
gone
to
bed
and
slept
in
perfect
tranquillity
while
those
men
and
women
whom
you
had
seen
were
out
in
the
river
bed
if
you
had
the
thunder
of
the
river
would
have
wakened
you
and
for
ever
your
very
heart
would
have
been
cold
with
a
chill
chiller
than
river
water
cold
at
the
thought
of
those
you
dared
to
leave
to
drown
you
can
not
see
them
you
say
you
can
god
has
given
eyes
to
the
mind
and
you
will
see
then
listen
it
is
god
who
speaks
if
thou
forbear
to
deliver
them
that
are
drawn
unto
death
and
those
that
are
ready
to
be
slain
if
thou
sayest
we
knew
it
not
doth
not
he
that
pondereth
the
heart
consider
it
and
he
that
keepeth
thy
soul
doth
not
he
know
it
and
shall
not
he
render
to
every
man
according
to
his
works
oh
by
the
thought
of
the
many
who
are
drawn
unto
death
and
the
many
that
are
ready
to
be
slain
by
the
thought
of
the
sorrow
of
jesus
who
loves
them
consider
these
things
but
all
are
not
called
to
come
we
know
it
we
do
not
forget
it
but
is
it
a
fact
so
forgotten
at
home
that
a
missionary
need
press
it
what
is
forgotten
surely
is
that
the
field
is
the
world
you
would
not
denude
england
would
england
be
denuded
would
a
single
seat
on
the
bishop
bench
or
a
single
parish
or
mission
hall
be
left
permanently
empty
if
the
man
who
fills
it
now
moved
out
to
the
place
which
no
one
fills
that
gap
on
the
precipice
edge
but
suppose
it
were
left
empty
would
it
be
so
dreadful
after
all
would
there
not
be
one
true
christian
left
to
point
the
way
to
christ
and
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
would
there
not
still
be
the
bible
and
ability
to
read
need
anyone
die
unsaved
unless
set
upon
if
only
christians
in
england
knew
how
to
draw
supplies
direct
from
god
if
only
those
who
can
not
come
would
take
up
the
responsibility
of
the
unconverted
around
them
why
should
not
a
parish
here
and
there
be
left
empty
for
awhile
surely
we
should
not
deliberately
leave
so
very
many
to
starve
to
death
because
those
who
have
the
bread
of
life
have
a
strong
desire
for
sweets
oh
the
spiritual
confectionery
consumed
every
year
in
england
god
open
our
eyes
to
see
if
we
are
doing
what
he
meant
and
what
he
means
should
continue
but
some
men
are
too
valuable
to
be
thrown
away
on
the
mission
field
they
are
such
successful
workers
pastors
evangelists
leaders
of
thought
they
could
not
possibly
be
spared
think
of
the
waste
of
burying
brain
in
unproductive
sand
apparently
it
is
so
but
is
it
really
so
does
god
view
it
like
that
where
should
we
have
been
if
he
had
thought
jesus
too
valuable
to
be
thrown
away
upon
us
was
not
each
hour
of
those
years
worth
more
than
a
lifetime
of
ours
what
is
god
definition
of
that
golden
word
success
he
looks
at
roman
catholic
europe
and
roman
and
heathen
south
america
and
mohammedan
and
heathen
africa
and
asia
and
many
a
forgotten
place
in
many
a
great
land
and
then
he
looks
at
us
and
i
wonder
what
he
thinks
ragland
fellow
of
corpus
christi
college
cambridge
after
years
of
waste
wrote
that
he
was
teaching
him
that
all
plans
for
securing
success
the
most
certain
is
christ
own
becoming
a
corn
of
wheat
falling
into
the
ground
and
if
coming
abroad
means
that
for
anyone
is
it
too
much
to
ask
it
was
what
our
dear
lord
did
this
brings
us
to
another
plea
i
find
it
in
the
verse
that
carves
out
with
two
strokes
the
whole
result
of
two
lives
if
any
man
work
abide
if
any
man
work
shall
be
burned
the
net
result
of
one
man
work
is
gold
silver
precious
stones
the
net
result
of
another
man
work
is
wood
hay
stubble
which
is
worth
the
spending
of
a
life
an
earnest
worker
in
her
special
line
of
work
is
looking
back
at
it
from
the
place
where
things
show
truest
and
she
says
god
help
us
all
what
is
the
good
done
by
any
such
work
as
mine
any
man
build
upon
this
foundation
wood
hay
stubble
if
any
man
work
shall
be
burned
he
shall
suffer
loss
but
he
himself
shall
be
saved
yet
so
as
by
fire
an
infinitude
of
pains
and
labour
and
all
to
disappear
like
the
stubble
and
the
hay
success
what
is
it
worth
i
was
flushed
with
praise
but
pausing
just
a
moment
to
draw
breath
i
could
not
choose
but
murmur
to
myself
this
all
all
that
done
and
all
that
gained
if
this
then
be
success
is
dismaller
than
any
failure
so
transparent
a
thing
is
the
glamour
of
success
to
and
should
it
dazzle
the
christian
to
whom
nothing
is
of
any
worth
but
the
thing
that
endures
should
arguments
based
upon
comparisons
between
the
apparent
success
of
work
at
home
as
distinguished
from
work
abroad
influence
us
in
any
way
is
it
not
very
solemn
this
calm
clear
setting
forth
of
a
truth
which
touches
each
of
us
man
work
shall
be
made
manifest
for
the
day
shall
declare
it
because
it
shall
be
revealed
by
fire
and
the
fire
shall
try
every
man
work
of
what
sort
it
and
as
we
realise
the
perishableness
of
all
work
however
apparently
successful
except
the
one
work
done
in
the
one
way
god
means
oh
does
it
not
stir
us
up
to
seek
with
an
intensity
of
purpose
which
will
not
be
denied
to
find
out
what
that
one
work
is
the
same
thought
comes
out
in
the
verse
which
tells
us
that
the
very
things
we
are
to
do
are
prepared
before
and
we
are
created
in
christ
jesus
to
do
them
if
this
is
so
then
will
the
doing
of
anything
else
seem
worth
while
when
we
look
back
and
see
life
as
god
sees
it
it
may
be
that
the
things
prepared
are
lying
close
at
our
hand
at
home
but
it
may
be
they
are
abroad
if
they
are
at
home
there
will
be
settled
peace
in
the
doing
of
them
there
but
if
they
are
abroad
and
we
will
not
come
and
do
them
oh
then
our
very
prayers
will
fall
as
fall
the
withered
leaves
when
the
wind
that
stirred
them
falls
yea
more
so
for
the
withered
leaves
have
a
work
to
do
but
the
prayers
which
are
stirred
up
by
some
passing
breeze
of
emotion
do
nothing
for
eternity
god
will
not
hear
our
prayers
for
the
heathen
if
he
means
us
to
be
out
among
them
instead
of
at
home
praying
for
them
or
if
he
means
us
to
give
up
some
son
or
daughter
and
we
prefer
to
pray
lord
save
us
from
hypocrisy
and
sham
shrivel
the
falsehood
from
us
if
we
say
we
love
thee
but
obey
thee
not
are
we
staying
at
home
and
praying
for
missions
when
thou
hast
said
to
us
go
are
we
holding
back
something
of
which
thou
hast
said
loose
it
and
let
it
go
lord
are
we
utterly
through
and
through
true
lord
god
of
truthfulness
save
us
from
sham
make
us
perfectly
true
i
turn
to
you
brothers
and
sisters
at
home
do
you
know
that
if
god
is
calling
you
and
you
refuse
to
obey
you
will
hardly
know
how
to
bear
what
will
happen
afterwards
sooner
or
later
you
will
know
yea
burn
through
every
part
of
your
being
with
the
knowledge
that
you
disobeyed
and
lost
your
chance
lost
it
for
ever
for
that
is
the
awful
part
it
is
rarely
given
to
one
to
go
back
and
pick
up
the
chance
he
knowingly
dropped
the
express
of
one
life
has
shot
past
the
points
and
one
can
not
go
back
the
lines
diverge
some
of
us
almost
shudder
now
to
think
how
nearly
we
stayed
at
home
a
missionary
writes
do
not
i
beseech
you
let
this
great
matter
drift
do
not
walk
in
uncertainty
do
not
be
turned
aside
you
will
be
eternally
the
poorer
if
you
do
it
may
be
you
are
not
clear
as
to
what
is
god
will
for
you
you
are
in
doubt
you
are
honest
but
a
thousand
questions
perplex
you
will
you
go
to
god
about
it
and
get
the
answer
direct
if
you
are
puzzled
about
things
which
a
straightforward
missionary
can
explain
will
you
buy
a
copy
of
not
and
read
it
alone
with
god
let
me
emphasise
that
word
alone
arise
go
forth
into
the
plain
and
i
will
there
talk
with
thee
there
was
a
voice
when
they
stood
and
had
let
down
their
wings
oh
by
the
thought
of
the
day
that
is
coming
when
the
fire
shall
try
all
we
are
doing
and
only
the
true
shall
stand
i
plead
for
an
honest
facing
of
the
question
before
it
is
too
late
but
this
is
not
our
strongest
plea
we
could
pile
them
up
plea
upon
plea
and
not
exhaust
the
number
which
press
and
urge
one
to
write
we
pass
them
all
and
go
to
the
place
where
the
strongest
waits
glory
is
being
given
to
another
this
is
the
most
solemn
plea
the
supreme
imperative
call
not
mere
pity
for
dead
souls
but
a
passion
for
the
glory
of
god
is
what
we
need
to
hold
us
through
to
victory
i
am
the
lord
that
is
my
name
and
my
glory
will
i
not
give
to
another
neither
my
praise
to
graven
images
but
the
men
he
made
to
glorify
him
take
his
glory
from
him
give
it
to
another
the
sin
of
it
the
shame
calls
with
a
low
deep
through
all
the
other
calls
god
glory
is
being
given
to
another
do
we
love
him
enough
to
care
or
do
we
measure
our
private
cost
if
these
distant
souls
are
to
be
won
and
finding
it
considerable
cease
to
think
or
care
is
it
nothing
to
you
all
ye
that
pass
by
behold
and
see
they
took
jesus
and
led
him
away
and
he
bearing
his
cross
went
forth
into
a
place
called
the
place
of
a
skull
where
they
crucified
him
herein
is
love
god
so
loved
the
world
have
we
petrified
past
feeling
can
we
stand
and
measure
now
i
know
that
only
the
spirit
who
counted
every
drop
that
fell
from
the
torn
brow
of
christ
as
dearer
than
all
the
jewelled
gates
of
paradise
can
lift
the
church
out
of
her
appreciation
of
the
world
the
world
as
it
appeals
to
her
own
selfish
lusts
into
an
appreciation
of
the
world
as
it
appeals
to
the
heart
of
god
o
spirit
come
and
lift
us
into
this
love
inspire
us
by
this
love
let
us
look
at
the
vision
of
the
glory
of
our
god
with
eyes
that
have
looked
at
his
love
we
would
not
base
a
single
plea
on
anything
weaker
than
solid
fact
sentiment
will
not
stand
the
strain
of
the
real
tug
of
war
but
is
it
fact
or
is
it
not
that
jesus
counted
you
and
me
and
the
other
people
in
the
world
actually
worth
dying
for
if
it
is
true
then
do
we
love
him
well
enough
to
care
with
the
whole
strength
of
our
being
that
almost
all
over
the
world
his
glory
is
being
given
to
another
if
this
does
not
move
us
is
it
because
we
do
not
love
him
very
much
or
is
it
that
we
have
never
prayed
with
honest
desire
as
moses
prayed
i
beseech
thee
show
me
thy
glory
he
only
saw
a
little
of
it
behold
there
is
a
place
by
me
and
thou
shalt
stand
upon
a
rock
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
while
my
glory
passeth
by
that
i
will
put
thee
in
a
clift
of
the
rock
and
will
cover
thee
with
my
hand
while
i
pass
by
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
passed
and
moses
was
aware
of
something
of
it
as
it
passed
but
my
face
shall
not
be
seen
and
yet
that
little
was
enough
to
mark
him
out
as
one
who
lived
for
one
purpose
shone
in
the
light
of
it
burned
with
the
fire
of
it
he
was
jealous
for
the
glory
of
his
god
and
we
we
beheld
his
glory
the
glory
as
of
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
full
of
grace
and
truth
and
we
we
have
seen
the
light
of
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
god
in
the
face
of
jesus
christ
while
my
glory
passeth
by
i
will
cover
thee
my
face
shall
not
be
seen
but
we
all
with
open
face
reflecting
as
in
a
mirror
the
glory
of
the
lord
are
changed
are
we
do
we
do
we
know
anything
at
all
about
it
have
we
ever
apprehended
this
for
which
we
are
apprehended
of
christ
jesus
have
we
seen
the
heavenly
vision
that
breaks
us
down
and
humbles
us
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
lord
ask
who
will
go
for
us
and
strengthens
us
to
answer
here
am
i
send
me
and
holds
us
on
to
obey
if
we
hear
him
saying
i
beseech
thee
show
me
thy
glory
shall
we
pray
it
meaning
it
now
to
the
very
uttermost
the
uttermost
may
hold
hard
things
but
easy
or
hard
there
is
no
other
way
to
reach
the
place
where
our
lives
can
receive
an
impetus
which
will
make
them
tell
for
eternity
the
motive
power
is
the
love
of
christ
not
our
love
for
him
only
but
his
very
love
itself
it
was
the
mighty
resistless
flow
of
that
glorious
love
that
made
the
first
missionary
pour
himself
forth
on
the
sacrifice
and
service
and
the
joy
of
it
rings
through
triumphantly
yea
and
if
i
be
poured
forth
i
joy
and
rejoice
with
you
all
yes
god
glory
is
our
plea
highest
strongest
most
impelling
and
enduring
of
all
pleas
but
oh
by
the
thought
of
the
myriads
who
are
passing
by
the
thought
of
the
coming
of
the
lord
by
the
infinite
realities
of
life
and
death
heaven
and
hell
by
our
saviour
cross
and
passion
we
plead
with
all
those
who
love
him
but
who
have
not
considered
these
things
yet
consider
them
now
let
him
show
us
the
vision
of
the
glory
and
bring
us
to
the
very
end
of
self
let
him
touch
our
lips
with
the
live
coal
and
set
us
on
fire
to
burn
for
him
yea
burn
with
consuming
love
for
him
and
a
purpose
none
can
turn
us
from
and
a
passion
like
a
pure
white
flame
a
passion
for
the
glory
of
god
oh
may
this
passion
consume
us
burn
the
self
out
of
us
burn
the
love
into
us
for
god
glory
we
ask
it
amen
worthy
is
the
lamb
that
was
slain
to
receive
power
and
riches
and
wisdom
and
strength
and
honour
and
glory
and
blessing
blessing
and
honour
and
glory
and
power
be
unto
him
appendix
some
indian
saints
there
was
one
he
has
joined
the
company
of
indian
saints
in
glory
now
the
poet
of
the
mission
and
our
friend
one
so
true
in
all
his
ways
that
a
hindu
lad
observing
him
with
critical
schoolboy
eyes
saw
in
him
as
in
a
mirror
something
of
the
holiness
of
god
and
won
by
that
look
became
a
christian
and
a
winner
of
souls
some
of
the
noblest
converts
of
our
mission
are
the
direct
result
of
that
tamil
poet
life
there
is
another
he
is
old
and
all
through
his
many
years
he
has
been
known
as
the
man
the
man
of
changeless
truth
he
is
a
village
pastor
whom
all
the
people
love
go
into
his
cottage
any
time
any
day
and
you
will
find
one
and
another
with
him
and
you
will
see
the
old
man
with
his
loving
face
and
almost
quite
blind
eyes
bending
patiently
to
catch
every
word
of
the
story
they
are
telling
and
then
you
will
hear
him
advising
and
comforting
as
a
father
would
his
child
for
miles
round
that
countryside
the
people
know
him
and
he
is
honoured
by
hindus
and
by
christians
as
india
honours
saints
i
remember
once
seeing
the
poet
and
the
pastor
together
they
belonged
to
widely
different
castes
but
that
was
forgotten
now
the
two
old
white
heads
were
bent
over
the
same
letter
a
letter
telling
of
the
defection
of
a
young
convert
each
had
loved
as
a
son
and
they
were
weeping
over
him
it
was
the
ancient
east
living
its
life
before
us
o
my
son
absalom
my
son
my
son
absalom
would
god
i
had
died
for
thee
o
absalom
my
son
my
son
but
what
made
it
a
thing
to
remember
in
this
land
of
caste
divisions
even
among
christians
was
the
overflowing
of
the
love
that
made
those
two
men
one
there
are
others
money
the
place
it
holds
in
a
man
affections
is
supposed
to
be
a
fair
test
of
character
we
could
tell
of
a
lawyer
who
is
losing
money
rather
than
touch
unrighteous
gains
of
a
doctor
who
gives
to
his
church
he
and
travels
any
distance
to
help
the
poor
who
can
not
pay
of
a
peasant
who
risks
a
certain
amount
of
injury
to
his
palms
rather
than
climb
them
on
sunday
and
in
many
an
town
and
village
dotted
about
on
the
wide
red
plain
we
have
simple
humble
holy
people
of
whom
the
world
knows
nothing
pastors
in
lonely
teachers
and
workers
and
just
ordinary
christians
who
do
the
day
work
and
shine
as
they
do
it
we
think
of
such
men
and
women
when
we
hear
the
critic
cry
and
we
wish
he
could
know
them
as
they
are
it
is
these
men
and
women
who
ask
us
to
tell
it
out
clearly
how
sorely
our
indian
church
needs
your
prayers
they
have
no
desire
to
hide
things
they
speak
straighter
than
we
do
and
far
more
strongly
and
they
believe
as
we
do
that
if
you
know
more
you
will
pray
more
