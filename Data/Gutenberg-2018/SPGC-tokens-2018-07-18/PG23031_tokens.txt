chapter
i
my
birth
and
parentage
early
tastes
and
travels
marriage
and
widowhood
i
was
born
in
the
town
of
kingston
in
the
island
of
jamaica
some
time
in
the
present
century
as
a
female
and
a
widow
i
may
be
well
excused
giving
the
precise
date
of
this
important
event
but
i
do
not
mind
confessing
that
the
century
and
myself
were
both
young
together
and
that
we
have
grown
side
by
side
into
age
and
consequence
i
am
a
creole
and
have
good
scotch
blood
coursing
in
my
veins
my
father
was
a
soldier
of
an
old
scotch
family
and
to
him
i
often
trace
my
affection
for
a
and
my
sympathy
with
what
i
have
heard
my
friends
call
the
pomp
pride
and
circumstance
of
glorious
war
many
people
have
also
traced
to
my
scotch
blood
that
energy
and
activity
which
are
not
always
found
in
the
creole
race
and
which
have
carried
me
to
so
many
varied
scenes
and
perhaps
they
are
right
i
have
often
heard
the
term
lazy
creole
applied
to
my
country
people
but
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
be
indolent
all
my
life
long
i
have
followed
the
impulse
which
led
me
to
be
up
and
doing
and
so
far
from
resting
idle
anywhere
i
have
never
wanted
inclination
to
rove
nor
will
powerful
enough
to
find
a
way
to
carry
out
my
wishes
that
these
qualities
have
led
me
into
many
countries
and
brought
me
into
some
strange
and
amusing
adventures
the
reader
if
he
or
she
has
the
patience
to
get
through
this
book
will
see
some
people
indeed
have
called
me
quite
a
female
ulysses
i
believe
that
they
intended
it
as
a
compliment
but
from
my
experience
of
the
greeks
i
do
not
consider
it
a
very
flattering
one
it
is
not
my
intention
to
dwell
at
any
length
upon
the
recollections
of
my
childhood
my
mother
kept
a
in
kingston
and
was
like
very
many
of
the
creole
women
an
admirable
doctress
in
high
repute
with
the
officers
of
both
services
and
their
wives
who
were
from
time
to
time
stationed
at
kingston
it
was
very
natural
that
i
should
inherit
her
tastes
and
so
i
had
from
early
youth
a
yearning
for
medical
knowledge
and
practice
which
has
never
deserted
me
when
i
was
a
very
young
child
i
was
taken
by
an
old
lady
who
brought
me
up
in
her
household
among
her
own
grandchildren
and
who
could
scarcely
have
shown
me
more
kindness
had
i
been
one
of
them
indeed
i
was
so
spoiled
by
my
kind
patroness
that
but
for
being
frequently
with
my
mother
i
might
very
likely
have
grown
up
idle
and
useless
but
i
saw
so
much
of
her
and
of
her
patients
that
the
ambition
to
become
a
doctress
early
took
firm
root
in
my
mind
and
i
was
very
young
when
i
began
to
make
use
of
the
little
knowledge
i
had
acquired
from
watching
my
mother
upon
a
great
sufferer
my
doll
i
have
noticed
always
what
actors
children
are
if
you
leave
one
alone
in
a
room
how
soon
it
clears
a
little
stage
and
making
an
audience
out
of
a
few
chairs
and
stools
proceeds
to
act
its
childish
griefs
and
blandishments
upon
its
doll
so
i
also
made
good
use
of
my
dumb
companion
and
confidante
and
whatever
disease
was
most
prevalent
in
kingston
be
sure
my
poor
doll
soon
contracted
it
i
have
had
many
medical
triumphs
in
later
days
and
saved
some
valuable
lives
but
i
really
think
that
few
have
given
me
more
real
gratification
than
the
rewarding
glow
of
health
which
my
fancy
used
to
picture
stealing
over
my
patient
waxen
face
after
long
and
precarious
illness
before
long
it
was
very
natural
that
i
should
seek
to
extend
my
practice
and
so
i
found
other
patients
in
the
dogs
and
cats
around
me
many
luckless
brutes
were
made
to
simulate
diseases
which
were
raging
among
their
owners
and
had
forced
down
their
reluctant
throats
the
remedies
which
i
deemed
most
likely
to
suit
their
supposed
complaints
and
after
a
time
i
rose
still
higher
in
my
ambition
and
despairing
of
finding
another
human
patient
i
proceeded
to
try
my
simples
and
essences
upon
myself
when
i
was
about
twelve
years
old
i
was
more
frequently
at
my
house
and
used
to
assist
her
in
her
duties
very
often
sharing
with
her
the
task
of
attending
upon
invalid
officers
or
their
wives
who
came
to
her
house
from
the
adjacent
camp
at
or
the
military
station
at
newcastle
as
i
grew
into
womanhood
i
began
to
indulge
that
longing
to
travel
which
will
never
leave
me
while
i
have
health
and
vigour
i
was
never
weary
of
tracing
upon
an
old
map
the
route
to
england
and
never
followed
with
my
gaze
the
stately
ships
homeward
bound
without
longing
to
be
in
them
and
see
the
blue
hills
of
jamaica
fade
into
the
distance
at
that
time
it
seemed
most
improbable
that
these
girlish
wishes
should
be
gratified
but
circumstances
which
i
need
not
explain
enabled
me
to
accompany
some
relatives
to
england
while
i
was
yet
a
very
young
woman
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
impressions
of
london
of
course
i
am
not
going
to
bore
the
reader
with
them
but
they
are
as
vivid
now
as
though
the
year
i
had
very
nearly
let
my
age
slip
then
had
not
been
long
ago
numbered
with
the
past
strangely
enough
some
of
the
most
vivid
of
my
recollections
are
the
efforts
of
the
london
to
poke
fun
at
my
and
my
companion
complexion
i
am
only
a
little
brown
a
few
shades
duskier
than
the
brunettes
whom
you
all
admire
so
much
but
my
companion
was
very
dark
and
a
fair
if
i
can
apply
the
term
to
her
subject
for
their
rude
wit
she
was
poor
thing
and
as
there
were
no
policemen
to
awe
the
boys
and
turn
our
servants
heads
in
those
days
our
progress
through
the
london
streets
was
sometimes
a
rather
chequered
one
i
remained
in
england
upon
the
occasion
of
my
first
visit
about
a
year
and
then
returned
to
kingston
before
long
i
again
started
for
london
bringing
with
me
this
time
a
large
stock
of
west
indian
preserves
and
pickles
for
sale
after
remaining
two
years
here
i
again
started
home
and
on
the
way
my
life
and
adventures
were
very
nearly
brought
to
a
premature
conclusion
had
been
kept
very
merrily
on
board
our
ship
the
velusia
and
on
the
following
day
a
fire
broke
out
in
the
hold
i
dare
say
it
would
have
resisted
all
the
crew
efforts
to
put
it
out
had
not
another
ship
appeared
in
sight
upon
which
the
fire
quietly
allowed
itself
to
be
extinguished
although
considerably
alarmed
i
did
not
lose
my
senses
but
during
the
time
when
the
contest
between
fire
and
water
was
doubtful
i
entered
into
an
amicable
arrangement
with
the
ship
cook
whereby
in
consideration
of
two
pounds
which
i
was
not
however
to
pay
until
the
crisis
arrived
he
agreed
to
lash
me
on
to
a
large
before
i
had
been
long
in
jamaica
i
started
upon
other
trips
many
of
them
undertaken
with
a
view
to
gain
thus
i
spent
some
time
in
new
providence
bringing
home
with
me
a
large
collection
of
handsome
shells
and
rare
which
created
quite
a
sensation
in
kingston
and
had
a
rapid
sale
i
visited
also
hayti
and
cuba
but
i
hasten
onward
in
my
narrative
returned
to
kingston
i
nursed
my
old
indulgent
patroness
in
her
last
long
illness
after
she
died
in
my
arms
i
went
to
my
mother
house
where
i
stayed
making
myself
useful
in
a
variety
of
ways
and
learning
a
great
deal
of
creole
medicinal
art
until
i
could
find
courage
to
say
no
to
a
certain
arrangement
timidly
proposed
by
seacole
but
married
him
and
took
him
down
to
black
river
where
we
established
a
store
poor
man
he
was
very
delicate
and
before
i
undertook
the
charge
of
him
several
doctors
had
expressed
most
unfavourable
opinions
of
his
health
i
kept
him
alive
by
kind
nursing
and
attention
as
long
as
i
could
but
at
last
he
grew
so
ill
that
we
left
black
river
and
returned
to
my
mother
house
at
kingston
within
a
month
of
our
arrival
there
he
died
this
was
my
first
great
trouble
and
i
felt
it
bitterly
for
days
i
never
stirred
lost
to
all
that
passed
around
me
in
a
dull
stupor
of
despair
if
you
had
told
me
that
the
time
would
soon
come
when
i
should
remember
this
sorrow
calmly
i
should
not
have
believed
it
possible
and
yet
it
was
so
i
do
not
think
that
we
creoles
sorrow
less
for
showing
it
so
impetuously
but
i
do
think
that
the
sharp
edge
of
our
grief
wears
down
sooner
than
theirs
who
preserve
an
outward
demeanour
of
calmness
and
nurse
their
woe
secretly
in
their
hearts

chagres

bay
and
gatun
life
in
panama
up
the
river
chagres
to
gorgona
and

i
had
one
other
great
grief
to
master
the
loss
of
my
mother
and
then
i
was
left
alone
to
battle
with
the
world
as
best
i
might
the
struggles
which
it
cost
me
to
succeed
in
life
were
sometimes
very
trying
nor
have
they
ended
yet
but
i
have
always
turned
a
bold
front
to
fortune
and
taken
and
shall
continue
to
take
as
my
brave
friends
in
the
army
and
navy
have
shown
me
how
my
hurts
before
although
it
was
no
easy
thing
for
a
widow
to
make
ends
meet
i
never
allowed
myself
to
know
what
repining
or
depression
was
and
so
succeeded
in
gaining
not
only
my
daily
bread
but
many
comforts
besides
from
the
beginning
indeed
my
experience
of
the
world
it
is
not
finished
yet
but
i
do
not
think
it
will
give
me
reason
to
change
my
opinion
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
by
no
means
the
hard
bad
world
which
some
selfish
people
would
have
us
believe
it
it
may
be
as
my
editor
says
that
gently
comes
the
world
to
those
that
are
cast
in
gentle
mould
hinting
at
the
same
time
politely
that
the
rule
may
apply
to
me
personally
and
perhaps
he
is
right
for
although
i
was
always
a
hearty
strong
woman
people
might
say
stout
i
think
my
heart
is
soft
enough
how
slowly
and
gradually
i
succeeded
in
life
need
not
be
told
at
length
my
fortunes
underwent
the
variations
which
befall
all
sometimes
i
was
rich
one
day
and
poor
the
next
i
never
thought
too
exclusively
of
money
believing
rather
that
we
were
born
to
be
happy
and
that
the
surest
way
to
be
wretched
is
to
prize
it
overmuch
had
i
done
so
i
should
have
mourned
over
many
a
promising
speculation
proving
a
failure
over
many
a
pan
of
preserves
or
guava
jelly
burnt
in
the
making
and
perhaps
lost
my
mind
when
the
great
fire
of
which
devastated
kingston
burnt
down
my
poor
home
as
it
was
i
very
nearly
lost
my
life
for
i
would
not
leave
my
house
until
every
chance
of
saving
it
had
gone
and
it
was
wrapped
in
flames
but
of
course
i
set
to
work
again
in
a
humbler
way
and
rebuilt
my
house
by
degrees
and
restocked
it
succeeding
better
than
before
for
i
had
gained
a
reputation
as
a
skilful
nurse
and
doctress
and
my
house
was
always
full
of
invalid
officers
and
their
wives
from
newcastle
or
the
adjacent
camp
sometimes
i
had
a
naval
or
military
surgeon
under
my
roof
from
whom
i
never
failed
to
glean
instruction
given
when
they
learned
my
love
for
their
profession
with
a
readiness
and
kindness
i
am
never
likely
to
forget
many
of
these
kind
friends
are
alive
now
i
met
with
some
when
my
adventures
had
carried
me
to
the
of
the
crimea
and
to
those
whose
eyes
may
rest
upon
these
pages
i
again
offer
my
acknowledgments
for
their
past
kindness
which
helped
me
to
be
useful
to
my
kind
in
many
lands
and
here
i
may
take
the
opportunity
of
explaining
that
it
was
from
a
confidence
in
my
own
powers
and
not
at
all
from
necessity
that
i
remained
an
unprotected
female
indeed
i
do
not
mind
confessing
to
my
reader
in
a
friendly
confidential
way
that
one
of
the
hardest
struggles
of
my
life
in
kingston
was
to
resist
the
pressing
candidates
for
the
late
seacole
shoes
officers
of
high
rank
sometimes
took
up
their
abode
in
my
house
others
of
inferior
rank
were
familiar
with
me
long
before
their
bravery
and
alas
too
often
death
in
the
crimea
made
them
world
famous
there
were
few
officers
of
the
to
whom
mother
seacole
was
not
well
known
before
she
joined
them
in
front
of
sebastopol
and
among
the
best
known
was
loveable
noble
h
v
whose
death
shocked
me
so
terribly
and
with
whose
useful
heroic
life
the
english
public
have
become
so
familiar
i
can
hear
the
ring
of
his
boyish
laughter
even
now
in
the
year
the
cholera
swept
over
the
island
of
jamaica
with
terrible
force
our
idea
perhaps
an
unfounded
one
was
that
a
steamer
from
new
orleans
was
the
means
of
introducing
it
into
the
island
anyhow
they
sent
some
clothes
on
shore
to
be
washed
and
poor
dolly
johnson
the
washerwoman
whom
we
all
knew
sickened
and
died
of
the
terrible
disease
while
the
cholera
raged
i
had
but
too
many
opportunities
of
watching
its
nature
and
from
a
b
who
was
then
lodging
in
my
house
received
many
hints
as
to
its
treatment
which
i
afterwards
found
invaluable
early
in
the
same
year
my
brother
had
left
kingston
for
the
isthmus
of
panama
then
the
great
to
and
from
golden
california
where
he
had
established
a
considerable
store
and
hotel
ever
since
he
had
done
so
i
had
found
some
difficulty
in
checking
my
reviving
disposition
to
roam
and
at
last
persuading
myself
that
i
might
be
of
use
to
him
he
was
far
from
strong
i
resigned
my
house
into
the
hands
of
a
cousin
and
made
arrangements
to
journey
to
chagres
having
come
to
this
conclusion
i
allowed
no
grass
to
grow
beneath
my
feet
but
set
to
work
busily
for
i
was
not
going
to
him
my
house
was
full
for
weeks
of
tailors
making
up
rough
coats
trousers
and
sempstresses
cutting
out
and
making
shirts
in
addition
to
these
my
kitchen
was
filled
with
busy
people
manufacturing
preserves
guava
jelly
and
other
delicacies
while
a
considerable
sum
was
invested
in
the
purchase
of
preserved
meats
vegetables
and
eggs
it
will
be
as
well
perhaps
if
i
explain
in
as
few
words
as
possible
the
then
condition
of
the
isthmus
of
panama
all
my
readers
must
know
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
it
to
those
who
do
not
that
between
north
america
and
the
envied
shores
of
california
stretches
a
little
neck
of
land
enough
on
the
map
dividing
the
atlantic
from
the
pacific
by
crossing
this
the
travellers
from
america
avoided
a
long
weary
and
dangerous
sea
voyage
round
cape
horn
or
an
almost
impossible
journey
by
land
but
that
journey
across
the
isthmus
insignificant
in
distance
as
it
was
was
by
no
means
an
easy
one
it
seemed
as
if
nature
had
determined
to
throw
every
conceivable
obstacle
in
the
way
of
those
who
should
seek
to
join
the
two
great
oceans
of
the
world
i
have
read
and
heard
many
accounts
of
old
endeavours
to
effect
this
important
and
gigantic
work
and
how
miserably
they
failed
it
was
reserved
for
the
men
of
our
age
to
accomplish
what
so
many
had
died
in
attempting
and
iron
and
steam
twin
giants
subdued
to
man
will
have
put
a
girdle
over
rocks
and
rivers
so
that
travellers
can
glide
as
smoothly
if
not
as
inexpensively
over
the
once
terrible
isthmus
of
darien
as
they
can
from
london
to
brighton
not
yet
however
does
civilization
rule
at
panama
the
weak
sway
of
the
new
granada
republic
despised
by
lawless
men
and
respected
by
none
is
powerless
to
control
the
refuse
of
every
nation
which
meet
together
upon
its
soil
whenever
they
feel
inclined
now
they
overpower
the
law
easily
but
seven
years
ago
when
i
visited
the
isthmus
of
panama
things
were
much
worse
and
a
licence
existed
compared
to
which
the
present
lawless
state
of
affairs
is
enviable
when
after
passing
chagres
an
town
for
about
seven
miles
the
steamer
reached
navy
bay
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
a
more
luckless
dreary
spot
three
sides
of
the
place
were
a
mere
swamp
and
the
town
itself
stood
upon
a
the
houses
being
built
upon
piles
which
some
one
told
me
rotted
regularly
every
three
years
the
railway
which
now
connects
the
bay
with
panama
was
then
building
and
ran
as
far
as
we
could
see
on
piles
connected
with
the
town
by
a
wooden
jetty
it
seemed
as
capital
a
nursery
for
ague
and
fever
as
death
could
hit
upon
anywhere
and
those
on
board
the
steamer
who
knew
it
confirmed
my
opinion
as
we
arrived
a
steady
of
rain
was
falling
from
an
inky
sky
the
white
men
who
met
us
on
the
wharf
appeared
ghostly
and
and
the
very
negroes
seemed
pale
and
wan
the
news
which
met
us
did
not
tempt
me
to
lose
any
time
in
getting
up
the
country
to
my
brother
according
to
all
accounts
fever
and
ague
with
some
minor
diseases
especially
dropsy
were
having
it
all
their
own
way
at
navy
bay
and
although
i
only
stayed
one
night
in
the
place
my
medicine
chest
was
called
into
requisition
but
the
sufferers
wanted
remedies
which
i
could
not
give
them
warmth
nourishment
and
fresh
air
beneath
leaky
tents
damp
huts
and
even
under
broken
railway
waggons
i
saw
men
dying
from
sheer
exhaustion
indeed
i
was
very
glad
when
with
the
morning
the
crowd
as
the
yankees
called
the
bands
of
pilgrims
to
and
from
california
made
ready
to
ascend
to
panama
the
first
stage
of
our
journey
was
by
railway
to
gatun
about
twelve
miles
distant
for
the
greater
portion
of
that
distance
the
lines
ran
on
piles
over
as
unhealthy
and
wretched
a
country
as
the
eye
could
well
grow
weary
of
but
at
last
the
country
improved
and
you
caught
glimpses
of
distant
hills
and
scenery
every
mile
of
that
fatal
railway
cost
the
world
thousands
of
lives
i
was
assured
that
its
site
was
marked
thickly
by
graves
and
that
so
great
was
the
mortality
among
the
labourers
that
three
times
the
survivors
struck
in
a
body
and
their
places
had
to
be
supplied
by
fresh
victims
from
america
tempted
by
rates
of
wages
it
is
a
gigantic
undertaking
and
shows
what
the
energy
and
enterprise
of
man
can
accomplish
everything
requisite
for
its
construction
even
the
timber
had
to
be
prepared
in
and
brought
from
america
the
railway
then
ran
no
further
than
gatun
and
here
we
were
to
take
water
and
ascend
the
river
chagres
to
gorgona
the
next
stage
on
the
way
to
cruces
where
my
brother
was
the
cars
landed
us
at
the
bottom
of
a
somewhat
steep
cutting
through
a
reddish
clay
and
deposited
me
and
my
suite
consisting
of
a
black
servant
named
mac
and
a
little
girl
in
safety
in
the
midst
of
my
many
packages
not
altogether
satisfied
with
my
prospects
for
the
rain
was
falling
heavily
and
steadily
and
the
gatun
porters
were
possessing
themselves
of
my
luggage
with
that
same
avidity
which
distinguishes
their
brethren
on
the
pier
of
calais
or
the
quays
of
pera
there
are
two
species
of
individuals
whom
i
have
found
alike
wherever
my
travels
have
carried
me
the
reader
can
guess
their
professions
porters
and
lawyers
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
gather
my
packages
together
sit
in
the
midst
with
a
determined
look
to
awe
the
hungry
crowd
around
me
and
send
mac
up
the
steep
slippery
bank
to
report
progress
after
a
little
while
he
returned
to
say
that
the
was
not
far
off
where
boats
could
be
hired
for
the
upward
journey
the
word
given
the
porters
threw
themselves
upon
my
packages
a
pitched
battle
ensued
out
of
which
issued
the
strongest
spanish
indians
with
their
hardly
earned
prizes
and
we
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
clayey
bank
now
although
the
surveyors
of
the
darien
highways
had
considerately
cut
steps
up
the
steep
incline
they
had
become
worse
than
useless
so
i
floundered
about
terribly
more
than
once
losing
my
footing
altogether
and
as
with
that
due
regard
to
personal
appearance
which
i
have
always
deemed
a
duty
as
well
as
a
pleasure
to
study
i
had
before
leaving
navy
bay
attired
myself
in
a
delicate
light
blue
dress
a
white
bonnet
prettily
trimmed
and
an
equally
chaste
shawl
the
reader
can
sympathise
with
my
distress
however
i
gained
the
summit
and
after
an
arduous
descent
of
a
few
minutes
duration
reached
the
in
a
most
piteous
plight
however
for
my
pretty
dress
from
its
contact
with
the
gatun
clay
looked
as
red
as
if
in
the
pursuit
of
science
i
had
passed
it
through
a
strong
solution
of
muriatic
acid
by
the
i
found
my
travelling
companions
arguing
angrily
with
the
shrewd
boatmen
and
bating
down
their
fares
upon
collecting
my
luggage
i
found
as
i
had
expected
that
the
porters
had
not
neglected
the
glorious
opportunity
of
robbing
a
woman
and
that
several
articles
were
missing
complaints
i
knew
would
not
avail
me
and
stronger
measures
seemed
hazardous
and
barely
advisable
in
a
lawless
spot
where
the
simple
plan
that
they
should
take
who
have
the
power
and
they
should
keep
who
can
seemed
universally
practised
and
would
very
likely
have
been
defended
by
its
practitioners
upon
principle
it
was
not
so
easy
to
hire
a
boat
as
i
had
been
led
to
expect
the
large
crowd
had
made
the
boatmen
somewhat
exorbitant
in
their
demands
and
there
were
several
reasons
why
i
should
engage
one
for
my
own
exclusive
use
instead
of
sharing
one
with
some
of
my
travelling
companions
in
the
first
place
my
luggage
was
somewhat
bulky
and
in
the
second
place
my
experience
of
travel
had
not
failed
to
teach
me
that
americans
even
from
the
northern
states
are
always
uncomfortable
in
the
company
of
coloured
people
and
very
often
show
this
feeling
in
stronger
ways
than
by
sour
looks
and
rude
words
i
think
if
i
have
a
little
prejudice
against
our
cousins
across
the
atlantic
and
i
do
confess
to
a
little
it
is
not
unreasonable
i
have
a
few
shades
of
deeper
brown
upon
my
skin
which
shows
me
related
and
i
am
proud
of
the
relationship
to
those
poor
mortals
whom
you
once
held
enslaved
and
whose
bodies
america
still
owns
and
having
this
bond
and
knowing
what
slavery
is
having
seen
with
my
eyes
and
heard
with
my
ears
proof
positive
enough
of
its
horrors
let
others
affect
to
doubt
them
if
they
will
is
it
surprising
that
i
should
be
somewhat
impatient
of
the
airs
of
superiority
which
many
americans
have
endeavoured
to
assume
over
me
mind
i
am
not
speaking
of
all
i
have
met
with
some
delightful
exceptions
at
length
i
succeeded
in
hiring
a
boat
for
the
modest
consideration
of
ten
pounds
to
carry
me
and
my
fortunes
to
cruces
my
boat
was
far
from
uncomfortable
large
and
with
an
awning
dirty
it
must
be
confessed
beneath
which
swung
a
hammock
of
which
i
took
immediate
possession
by
the
way
the
central
americans
should
adopt
the
hammock
as
their
national
badge
but
for
sheer
necessity
they
would
never
leave
it
the
master
of
the
boat
the
padrone
was
a
fine
tall
negro
his
crew
were
four
common
enough
specimens
of
humanity
with
a
marked
disregard
of
the
prejudices
of
society
with
respect
to
clothing
a
dirty
handkerchief
rolled
over
the
head
and
a
wisp
of
something
which
might
have
been
linen
bound
round
the
loins
formed
their
attire
perhaps
however
the
thick
coating
of
dirt
which
covered
them
kept
them
warmer
than
more
civilized
clothing
besides
being
indisputably
more
economical
the
boat
was
generally
propelled
by
paddles
but
when
the
river
was
shallow
poles
were
used
to
punt
us
along
as
on
english
rivers
the
black
padrone
whose
superior
position
was
indicated
by
the
use
of
decent
clothing
standing
at
the
helm
gesticulating
wildly
and
swearing
spanish
oaths
with
a
vehemence
that
would
have
put
corporal
trim
comrades
in
flanders
to
the
blush
very
much
shocked
of
course
but
finding
it
perfectly
useless
to
remonstrate
with
him
i
swung
myself
in
my
hammock
and
leisurely
watched
the
river
scene
the
river
chagres
lolled
with
considerable
force
now
between
low
marshy
shores
now
narrowing
between
steep
thickly
wooded
banks
it
was
liable
as
are
all
rivers
in
hilly
districts
to
sudden
and
heavy
floods
and
although
the
padrone
on
leaving
gatun
had
pledged
his
soul
to
land
me
at
cruces
that
night
i
had
not
been
long
afloat
before
i
saw
that
he
would
forfeit
his
worthless
pledge
for
the
wind
rose
to
a
gale
ruffling
the
river
here
and
there
into
a
little
sea
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
while
the
river
rose
rapidly
bearing
down
on
its
swollen
stream
trunks
of
trees
and
similar
waifs
and
strays
which
it
tossed
about
like
a
giant
in
sport
threatening
to
snag
us
with
its
playthings
every
moment
and
when
we
came
to
a
sheltered
reach
and
found
that
the
little
fleet
of
boats
which
had
preceded
us
had
laid
to
there
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
stiff
tired
and
hungry
i
should
have
to
pass
a
night
upon
the
river
chagres
all
i
could
get
to
eat
was
some
guavas
which
grew
wild
upon
the
banks
and
then
i
watched
the
padrone
curl
his
long
body
up
among
my
luggage
and
listened
to
the
crew
who
had
rolled
together
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
snore
as
peacefully
as
if
they
slept
between
fair
linen
sheets
in
the
purest
of
calico
and
the
most
unexceptionable
of
nightcaps
until
somehow
i
fell
into
a
troubled
dreamy
sleep
at
daybreak
we
were
enabled
to
pursue
our
journey
and
in
a
short
time
reached
gorgona
i
was
glad
enough
to
go
on
shore
as
you
may

gorgona
was
a
mere
temporary
town
of
bamboo
and
wood
houses
hastily
erected
to
serve
as
a
station
for
the
crowd
in
the
present
rainy
season
when
the
river
was
navigable
up
to
cruces
the
chief
part
of
the
population
migrated
thither
so
that
gorgona
was
almost
deserted
and
looked
indescribably
damp
dirty
and
dull
with
some
difficulty
i
found
a
bakery
and
a
butcher
shop
the
meat
was
not
very
tempting
for
the
gorgona
butchers
did
not
trouble
themselves
about
joints
but
cut
the
flesh
into
strips
about
three
inches
wide
and
of
various
lengths
these
were
hung
upon
rails
so
that
you
bought
your
meat
by
the
yard
and
were
spared
any
difficulty
in
the
choice
of
joint
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
favourably
impressed
with
this
novel
and
simple
way
of
avoiding
trouble
but
i
was
far
too
hungry
to
be
particular
and
buying
a
strip
for
a
quarter
of
a
real
carried
it
off
to
mac
to
cook
late
that
afternoon
the
padrone
and
his
crew
landed
me
tired
wretched
and
out
of
temper
upon
the
miserable
wharf

my
reception
at
the
independent
hotel
a

life
in

amusements
of
the
crowds
a
novel
bed
the
sympathising
reader
who
very
likely
has
been
laughing
heartily
at
my
late
troubles
can
fancy
that
i
was
looking
forward
with
no
little
pleasurable
anticipation
to
reaching
my
brother
cheerful
home
at
cruces
after
the
long
night
spent
on
board
the
wretched
boat
in
my
stiff
clayey
dress
and
the
hours
of
fasting
the
warmth
and
good
cheer
of
the
independent
hotel
could
not
fail
to
be
acceptable
my
brother
met
me
on
the
rickety
wharf
with
the
kindest
welcome
in
his
face
although
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
a
smile
at
my
forlorn
appearance
and
giving
the
necessary
instructions
about
my
luggage
led
the
way
at
once
to
his
house
which
was
situated
at
the
upper
end
of
the
street
a
capital
site
he
said
when
the
rest
of
the
town
was
under
water
which
agreeable
variety
occurred
twice
or
thrice
a
year
unexpectedly
on
our
way
he
rather
damped
my
hopes
by
expressing
his
fears
that
he
should
be
unable
to
provide
his
sister
with
the
accommodation
he
could
wish
for
you
see
he
said
the
crowd
from
panama
has
just
come
in
meeting
your
crowd
from
navy
bay
and
i
should
be
at
all
surprised
if
very
many
of
them
have
no
better
bed
than
the
store
floors
but
despite
this
warning
i
was
miserably
unprepared
for
the
reception
that
awaited
me
to
be
sure
i
found
cruces
as
like
gorgona
in
its
dampness
dirt
and
confusion
as
it
well
could
be
but
the
crowd
from
the
of
california
had
just
arrived
having
made
the
journey
from
panama
on
mules
and
the
street
was
filled
with
motley
groups
in
picturesque
variety
of
attire
the
hotels
were
also
full
of
them
while
many
lounged
in
the
verandahs
after
their
day
journey
rude
coarse
in
shirts
and
long
serviceable
boots
elbowed
in
perfect
equality
keen
yankee
speculators
as
close
shaven
neat
and
clean
on
the
isthmus
of
panama
as
in
the
streets
of
new
york
or
new
orleans
the
women
alone
kept
aloof
from
each
other
and
well
they
might
for
while
a
very
few
seemed
not
ashamed
of
their
sex
it
was
somewhat
difficult
to
distinguish
the
majority
from
their
male
companions
save
by
their
bolder
and
more
reckless
voice
and
manner
i
must
say
however
that
many
of
them
adopted
male
attire
for
the
journey
across
the
isthmus
only
as
it
spared
them
many
compliments
which
their
husbands
were
often
disposed
to
resent
however
flattering
they
might
be
to
their
choice
through
all
these
i
pressed
on
stiff
cold
and
hungry
to
the
independent
hotel
eagerly
anticipating
the
comforts
which
awaited
me
there
at
length
we
reached
it
but
rest
warmth
comfort
miserable
delusions
picture
to
yourself
sympathising
reader
a
long
low
hut
built
of
rough
unhewn
unplaned
logs
filled
up
with
mud
and
split
bamboo
a
long
sloping
roof
and
a
large
verandah
already
full
of
visitors
and
the
interior
a
long
room
gaily
hung
with
dirty
calico
in
stripes
of
red
and
white
above
it
another
room
in
which
the
guests
slept
having
the
benefit
of
sharing
in
any
orgies
which
might
be
going
on
below
them
through
the
broad
chinks
between
the
rough
irregular
planks
which
formed
its
floor
at
the
further
end
a
small
corner
partitioned
roughly
off
formed
a
bar
and
around
it
were
shelves
laden
with
stores
for
the
travellers
while
behind
it
was
a
little
room
used
by
my
brother
as
his
private
apartment
but
three
female
travellers
had
hired
it
for
their
own
especial
use
for
the
night
paying
the
enormous
sum
of
for
so
exclusive
a
luxury
at
the
entrance
sat
a
black
man
taking
toll
of
the
giving
them
in
exchange
for
coin
or
he
had
a
rusty
pair
of
scales
to
weigh
the
latter
a
dirty
ticket
which
guaranteed
them
supper
a
night
lodging
and
breakfast
i
saw
all
this
very
quickly
and
turned
round
upon
my
brother
in
angry
despair
what
am
i
to
do
why
did
you
ever
bring
me
to
this
place
see
what
a
state
i
am
in
cold
hungry
and
wretched
i
want
to
wash
to
change
my
clothes
to
eat
to
but
poor
edward
could
only
shrug
his
shoulders
and
shake
his
head
in
answer
to
my
indignant
remonstrances
at
last
he
made
room
for
me
in
a
corner
of
the
crowded
bar
set
before
me
some
food
and
left
me
to
watch
the
strange
life
i
had
come
to
and
before
long
i
soon
forgot
my
troubles
in
the
novelty
of
my
position
the
difference
between
the
passengers
to
and
from
california
was
very
distinguishable
those
bound
for
the
gold
country
were
to
a
certain
extent
fresh
from
civilization
and
had
scarcely
thrown
off
its
control
whereas
the
homeward
bound
revelled
in
disgusting
excess
of
licence
although
many
of
the
women
on
their
way
to
california
showed
clearly
enough
that
the
life
of
licence
they
sought
would
not
be
altogether
unfamiliar
to
them
they
still
retained
some
appearance
of
decency
in
their
attire
and
manner
but
in
many
cases
as
i
have
before
said
the
female
companions
of
the
successful
appeared
in
no
hurry
to
resume
the
dress
or
obligations
of
their
sex
many
were
clothed
as
the
men
were
in
flannel
shirt
and
boots
rode
their
mules
in
unfeminine
fashion
but
with
much
ease
and
courage
and
in
their
conversation
successfully
rivalled
the
coarseness
of
their
lords
i
think
on
the
whole
that
those
french
lady
writers
who
desire
to
enjoy
the
privileges
of
man
with
the
irresponsibility
of
the
other
sex
would
have
been
delighted
with
the
disciples
who
were
carrying
their
principles
into
practice
in
the
streets
of
cruces
the
chief
object
of
all
the
travellers
seemed
to
be
dinner
or
supper
i
do
not
know
what
term
they
gave
it
down
the
entire
length
of
the
independent
hotel
ran
a
table
covered
with
a
green
oilskin
cloth
and
at
proper
intervals
were
placed
knives
and
forks
plates
and
cups
and
saucers
turned
down
and
when
a
received
his
ticket
and
wished
to
secure
his
place
for
the
coming
repast
he
would
turn
his
plate
cup
and
saucer
up
which
mode
of
reserving
seats
seemed
respected
by
the
rest
and
as
the
evening
wore
on
the
shouting
and
quarrelling
at
the
doorway
in
yankee
twang
increased
momentarily
while
some
seated
themselves
at
the
table
and
hammering
upon
it
with
the
handles
of
their
knives
hallooed
out
to
the
excited
nigger
cooks
to
make
haste
with
the
slapjack
amidst
all
this
confusion
my
brother
was
quietly
selling
shirts
boots
trousers
to
the
travellers
while
above
all
the
din
could
be
heard
the
screaming
voices
of
his
touters
without
drawing
attention
to
the
good
cheer
of
the
independent
hotel
over
and
over
again
while
i
cowered
in
my
snug
corner
wishing
to
avoid
the
notice
of
all
did
i
wish
myself
safe
back
in
my
pleasant
home
in
kingston
but
it
was
too
late
to
find
out
my
mistake
now
at
last
the
table
was
nearly
filled
with
a
motley
assemblage
of
men
and
women
and
the
slapjack
hot
and
steaming
was
carried
in
by
the
black
cooks
the
hungry
diners
welcomed
its
advent
with
a
shout
of
delight
and
yet
it
did
not
seem
particularly
tempting
but
beyond
all
doubt
it
was
a
capital
de
for
great
eaters
and
before
the
dinner
was
over
i
saw
ample
reasons
to
induce
any
to
give
it
his
patronage
in
truth
it
was
a
thick
substantial
pancake
of
flour
salt
and
water
eggs
were
far
too
expensive
to
be
used
in
its
composition
and
by
the
time
the
supply
had
disappeared
i
thought
the
largest
appetites
must
have
been
stayed
but
it
was
followed
by
pork
strips
of
beef
stewed
with
hard
dumplings
hams
great
dishes
of
rice
jugs
of
molasses
and
treacle
for
sauce
the
whole
being
washed
down
with
an
abundance
of
tea
and
coffee
chickens
and
eggs
were
provided
for
those
who
were
prepared
to
pay
for
these
luxuries
of
panama
life
but
so
scarce
and
expensive
were
they
that
as
i
afterwards
discovered
those
whose
larders
were
so
stocked
would
hang
out
a
chicken
upon
their
signposts
as
a
sure
attraction
for
the
richer
and
more
reckless
diggers
while
the
touter
cry
of
eggs
and
chickens
here
was
a
very
telling
one
wine
and
spirits
were
also
obtainable
but
were
seldom
taken
by
the
americans
who
are
abstemious
abroad
as
well
as
at
home
after
dinner
the
store
soon
cleared
gambling
was
a
great
attraction
but
my
brother
dreading
its
consequences
with
these
armed
men
allowed
none
to
take
place
in
his
hotel
so
some
lounged
away
to
the
faro
and
monte
tables
which
were
doing
a
busy
trade
others
loitered
in
the
verandah
smoking
and
looking
at
the
native
women
who
sang
and
danced
fandangos
before
them
the
whole
of
the
dirty
place
which
had
looked
so
wretched
by
the
light
of
day
was
brilliantly
illuminated
now
night
would
bring
no
rest
to
cruces
while
the
crowds
were
there
to
be
fed
cheated
or
amused
daybreak
would
find
the
with
their
piles
of
silver
and
little
heaps
of
still
surrounded
by
haggard
gamblers
daybreak
would
gleam
sickly
upon
the
tawdry
finery
of
the
poor
spanish
singers
and
dancers
whose
weary
night
work
would
enable
them
to
live
upon
the
travellers
bounty
for
the
next
week
or
so
these
few
hours
of
gaiety
and
excitement
were
to
provide
the
cruces
people
with
food
and
clothing
for
as
many
days
and
while
their
transitory
sun
shone
i
will
do
them
the
justice
to
say
they
gathered
in
their
hay
busily
in
the
exciting
race
for
gold
we
need
not
be
surprised
at
the
strange
groups
which
line
the
all
that
i
wondered
at
was
that
i
had
not
foreseen
what
i
found
or
that
my
rage
for
change
and
novelty
had
closed
my
ears
against
the
warning
voices
of
those
who
knew
somewhat
of
the
to
california
but
i
was
too
tired
to
moralise
long
and
begged
my
brother
to
find
me
a
bed
somewhere
he
failed
to
do
so
completely
and
in
despair
i
took
the
matter
in
my
own
hands
and
stripping
the
green
oilskin
cloth
from
the
rough
table
it
would
not
be
wanted
again
until
breakfast
pinned
up
some
curtains
round
the
table
legs
and
turned
in
with
my
little
servant
beneath
it
it
was
some
comfort
to
know
that
my
brother
his
servants
and
mac
brought
their
mattresses
and
slept
upon
it
above
us
it
was
a
novel
bed
and
required
some
slight
stretch
of
the
imagination
to
fancy
it
a
but
i
was
too
tired
to
be
particular
and
slept
soundly
we
were
up
right
early
on
the
following
morning
and
refreshed
with
my
night
sleep
i
entered
heartily
into
the
preparations
for
breakfast
that
meal
over
the
passengers
took
boats
for
gorgona
while
those
bound
for
california
hired
mules
for
the
land
journey
to
panama
so
after
awhile
all
cleared
away
and
cruces
was
left
to
its
unhealthy
solitude
chapter
iv
an
unwelcome
visitor
in
cruces
the
cholera
success
of
the
yellow
doctress
fearful
scene
at
the
the
burying
parties
the
cholera
attacks
me
i
do
not
think
i
have
ever
known
what
it
is
to
despair
or
even
to
despond
if
such
were
my
inclination
i
have
had
some
opportunities
recently
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
began
to
find
out
the
bright
side
of
cruces
life
and
enter
into
schemes
for
staying
there
but
it
would
be
a
week
or
so
before
the
advent
of
another
crowd
would
wake
cruces
to
life
and
activity
again
and
in
the
meanwhile
and
until
i
could
find
a
convenient
hut
for
my
intended
hotel
i
remained
my
brother
guest
but
it
was
destined
that
i
should
not
be
long
in
cruces
before
my
medicinal
skill
and
knowledge
were
put
to
the
test
before
the
passengers
for
panama
had
been
many
days
gone
it
was
found
that
they
had
left
one
of
their
number
behind
them
and
that
one
the
cholera
i
believe
that
the
faculty
have
not
yet
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
cholera
is
contagious
and
i
am
not
presumptuous
enough
to
forestall
them
but
my
people
have
always
considered
it
to
be
so
and
the
poor
cruces
folks
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
this
new
and
terrible
plague
had
been
a
with
the
americans
from
new
orleans
or
some
other
of
its
favoured
haunts
i
had
the
first
intimation
of
its
unwelcome
presence
in
the
following
abrupt
and
unpleasant
manner
a
spaniard
an
old
and
intimate
friend
of
my
brother
had
supped
with
him
one
evening
and
upon
returning
home
had
been
taken
ill
and
after
a
short
period
of
intense
suffering
had
died
so
sudden
and
so
mysterious
a
death
gave
rise
to
the
rumour
that
he
had
been
poisoned
and
suspicion
rested
for
a
time
perhaps
not
unnaturally
upon
my
brother
in
whose
company
the
dead
man
had
last
been
anxious
for
many
reasons
the
chief
one
perhaps
the
position
of
my
brother
i
went
down
to
see
the
corpse
a
single
glance
at
the
poor
fellow
showed
me
the
terrible
truth
the
distressed
face
sunken
eyes
cramped
limbs
and
discoloured
shrivelled
skin
were
all
symptoms
which
i
had
been
familiar
with
very
recently
and
at
once
i
pronounced
the
cause
of
death
to
be
cholera
the
cruces
people
were
mightily
angry
with
me
for
expressing
such
an
opinion
even
my
brother
although
it
relieved
him
of
the
odium
of
a
great
crime
was
as
annoyed
as
the
rest
but
by
twelve
that
morning
one
of
the
spaniard
friends
was
attacked
similarly
and
the
very
people
who
had
been
most
angry
with
me
a
few
hours
previously
came
to
me
now
eager
for
advice
there
was
no
doctor
in
cruces
the
nearest
approach
to
one
was
a
little
timid
dentist
who
was
there
by
accident
and
who
refused
to
prescribe
for
the
sufferer
and
i
was
obliged
to
do
my
best
selecting
from
my
medicine
chest
i
never
travel
anywhere
without
it
what
i
deemed
necessary
i
went
hastily
to
the
patient
and
at
once
adopted
the
remedies
i
considered
fit
it
was
a
very
obstinate
case
but
by
dint
of
mustard
emetics
warm
fomentations
mustard
plasters
on
the
stomach
and
the
back
and
calomel
at
first
in
large
then
in
gradually
smaller
doses
i
succeeded
in
saving
my
first
cholera
patient
in
cruces
for
a
few
days
the
terrible
disease
made
such
slow
progress
amongst
us
that
we
almost
hoped
it
had
passed
on
its
way
and
spared
us
but
all
at
once
it
spread
rapidly
and
affrighted
faces
and
cries
of
woe
soon
showed
how
fatally
the
destroyer
was
at
work
and
in
so
great
request
were
my
services
that
for
days
and
nights
together
i
scarcely
knew
what
it
was
to
enjoy
two
successive
hours
rest
and
here
i
must
pause
to
set
myself
right
with
my
kind
reader
he
or
she
will
not
i
hope
think
that
in
narrating
these
incidents
i
am
exalting
my
poor
part
in
them
unduly
i
do
not
deny
it
is
the
only
thing
indeed
that
i
have
to
be
proud
of
that
i
pleased
and
gratified
when
i
look
back
upon
my
past
life
and
see
times
now
and
then
and
places
here
and
there
when
and
where
i
have
been
enabled
to
benefit
my
suffering
from
ills
my
skill
could
often
remedy
nor
do
i
think
that
the
kind
reader
will
consider
this
feeling
an
unworthy
one
if
it
be
so
and
if
in
the
following
pages
the
account
of
what
providence
has
given
me
strength
to
do
on
larger
fields
of
action
be
considered
vain
or
egotistical
still
i
can
not
help
narrating
them
for
my
share
in
them
appears
to
be
the
one
and
only
claim
i
have
to
interest
the
public
ear
moreover
i
shall
be
sadly
disappointed
if
those
years
of
life
which
may
be
still
in
store
for
me
are
not
permitted
by
providence
to
be
devoted
to
similar
usefulness
i
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
for
the
gratification
is
after
all
a
selfish
one
that
i
love
to
be
of
service
to
those
who
need
a
woman
help
and
wherever
the
need
arises
on
whatever
distant
shore
i
ask
no
greater
or
higher
privilege
than
to
minister
to
it
after
this
explanation
i
resume
more
freely
the
account
of
my
labours
in
cruces
it
was
scarcely
surprising
that
the
cholera
should
spread
rapidly
for
fear
is
its
powerful
auxiliary
and
the
cruces
people
bowed
down
before
the
plague
in
slavish
despair
the
americans
and
other
foreigners
in
the
place
showed
a
brave
front
but
the
natives
constitutionally
cowardly
made
not
the
feeblest
show
of
resistance
beyond
filling
the
poor
church
and
making
the
priests
bring
out
into
the
streets
figures
of
tawdry
dirty
saints
supposed
to
possess
some
miraculous
influence
which
they
never
exerted
before
which
they
prostrated
themselves
invoking
their
aid
with
passionate
prayers
and
cries
they
did
nothing
very
likely
the
saints
would
have
got
the
credit
of
helping
them
if
they
had
helped
themselves
but
the
poor
cowards
never
stirred
a
finger
to
clean
out
their
close
reeking
huts
or
rid
the
damp
streets
of
the
rotting
accumulation
of
months
i
think
their
chief
reliance
was
on
the
yellow
woman
from
jamaica
with
the
cholera
medicine
nor
was
this
surprising
for
the
spanish
doctor
who
was
sent
for
from
panama
became
nervous
and
frightened
at
the
horrors
around
him
and
the
people
soon
saw
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
the
terrible
disease
he
was
called
upon
to
do
battle
with
and
preferred
trusting
to
one
who
was
it
must
be
understood
that
many
of
those
who
could
afford
to
pay
for
my
services
did
so
handsomely
but
the
great
majority
of
my
patients
had
nothing
better
to
give
their
doctress
than
thanks
the
best
part
of
my
practice
lay
amongst
the
american
store
and
hotel
keepers
the
worst
among
the
native
boatmen
and
muleteers
these
latter
died
by
scores
and
among
them
i
saw
some
scenes
of
horror
i
would
fain
forget
if
it
were
possible
one
terrible
night
passed
with
some
of
them
has
often
haunted
me
i
will
endeavour
to
narrate
it
and
should
the
reader
be
supposed
to
think
it
highly
coloured
and
doubtful
i
will
only
tell
him
that
terrible
as
it
seems
i
saw
almost
as
fearful
scenes
on
the
crimean
peninsula
among
british
men
a
few
thousand
miles
only
from
comfort
and
plenty
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
the
largest
in
cruces
came
to
me
and
implored
me
to
accompany
him
to
his
kraal
a
short
distance
from
the
town
where
he
said
some
of
his
men
were
dying
one
in
particular
his
head
muleteer
a
very
valuable
servant
he
was
most
selfishly
anxious
for
and
on
the
way
thither
promised
me
a
large
remuneration
if
i
should
succeed
in
saving
him
our
journey
was
not
a
long
one
but
it
rained
hard
and
the
fields
were
flooded
so
that
it
took
us
some
time
to
reach
the
long
low
hut
which
he
called
his
home
i
would
rather
not
see
such
another
scene
as
the
interior
of
that
hut
presented
its
roof
scarcely
sheltered
its
wretched
inmates
from
the
searching
rain
its
floor
was
the
damp
rank
turf
trodden
by
the
mules
hoofs
and
the
muleteers
feet
into
thick
mud
around
in
dirty
hammocks
and
on
the
damp
floor
were
the
inmates
of
this
wretched
place
male
and
female
the
strong
and
the
sick
together
breathing
air
that
nearly
choked
me
accustomed
as
i
had
grown
to
live
in
impure
atmosphere
for
beneath
the
same
roof
the
mules
more
valuable
to
their
master
than
his
human
servants
were
stabled
their
locked
and
beside
them
were
heaps
of
saddles
packs
and
harness
the
groans
of
the
sufferers
and
the
anxiety
and
fear
of
their
comrades
were
so
painful
to
hear
and
witness
that
for
a
few
minutes
i
felt
an
almost
uncontrollable
impulse
to
run
out
into
the
stormy
night
and
flee
from
this
but
the
weak
feeling
vanished
and
i
set
about
my
duty
the
was
so
frightened
that
he
did
not
hesitate
to
obey
orders
and
by
my
directions
doors
and
shutters
were
thrown
open
fires
were
lighted
and
every
effort
made
to
ventilate
the
place
and
then
with
the
aid
of
the
frightened
women
i
applied
myself
to
my
poor
patients
two
were
beyond
my
skill
death
alone
could
give
them
relief
the
others
i
could
help
but
no
words
of
mine
could
induce
them
to
bear
their
terrible
sufferings
like
men
they
screamed
and
groaned
not
like
women
for
few
would
have
been
so
but
like
children
calling
in
the
intervals
of
violent
pain
upon
jesu
the
madonna
and
all
the
saints
of
heaven
whom
their
lives
had
scandalised
i
stayed
with
them
until
midnight
and
then
got
away
for
a
little
time
but
i
had
not
long
been
quiet
before
the
was
after
me
again
the
men
were
worse
would
i
return
with
him
the
rain
was
drifting
heavily
on
the
thatched
roof
as
it
only
does
in
tropical
climates
and
i
was
tired
to
death
but
i
could
not
resist
his
appeal
he
had
brought
with
him
a
pair
of
tall
thick
boots
in
which
i
was
to
wade
through
the
flooded
fields
and
with
some
difficulty
i
again
reached
the
kraal
i
found
the
worst
cases
sinking
fast
one
of
the
others
had
relapsed
while
fear
had
paralysed
the
efforts
of
the
rest
at
last
i
restored
some
order
and
with
the
help
of
the
bravest
of
the
women
fixed
up
rude
screens
around
the
dying
men
but
no
screens
could
shut
out
from
the
others
their
awful
groans
and
cries
for
the
aid
that
no
mortal
power
could
give
them
so
the
long
night
passed
away
first
a
deathlike
stillness
behind
one
screen
and
then
a
sudden
silence
behind
the
other
showing
that
the
fierce
battle
with
death
was
over
and
who
had
been
the
victor
and
meanwhile
i
sat
before
the
flickering
fire
with
my
last
patient
in
my
lap
a
poor
little
orphan
infant
scarce
a
year
old
was
dying
in
my
arms
and
i
was
powerless
to
save
it
it
may
seem
strange
but
it
is
a
fact
that
i
thought
more
of
that
little
child
than
i
did
of
the
men
who
were
struggling
for
their
lives
and
prayed
very
earnestly
and
solemnly
to
god
to
spare
it
but
it
did
not
please
him
to
grant
my
prayer
and
towards
morning
the
wee
spirit
left
this
sinful
world
for
the
home
above
it
had
so
lately
left
and
what
was
mortal
of
the
little
infant
lay
dead
in
my
arms
then
it
was
that
i
began
to
think
how
the
idea
first
arose
in
my
mind
i
can
hardly
say
that
if
it
were
possible
to
take
this
little
child
and
examine
it
i
should
learn
more
of
the
terrible
disease
which
was
sparing
neither
young
nor
old
and
should
know
better
how
to
do
battle
with
it
i
was
not
afraid
to
use
my
baby
patient
thus
i
knew
its
fled
spirit
would
not
reproach
me
for
i
had
done
all
i
could
for
it
in
life
had
shed
tears
over
it
and
prayed
for
it
it
was
cold
grey
dawn
and
the
rain
had
ceased
when
i
followed
the
man
who
had
taken
the
dead
child
away
to
bury
it
and
bribed
him
to
carry
it
by
an
unfrequented
path
down
to
the
and
accompany
me
to
the
thick
retired
bush
on
the
opposite
bank
having
persuaded
him
thus
much
it
was
not
difficult
with
the
help
of
silver
arguments
to
convince
him
that
it
would
be
for
the
general
benefit
and
his
own
if
i
could
learn
from
this
poor
little
thing
the
secret
inner
workings
of
our
common
foe
and
ultimately
he
stayed
by
me
and
aided
me
in
my
first
and
last
examination
it
seems
a
strange
deed
to
accomplish
and
i
am
sure
i
could
not
wield
the
scalpel
or
the
substitute
i
then
used
now
but
at
that
time
the
excitement
had
strung
my
mind
up
to
a
high
pitch
of
courage
and
determination
and
perhaps
the
daily
almost
hourly
scenes
of
death
had
made
me
somewhat
callous
i
need
not
linger
on
this
scene
nor
give
the
readers
the
results
of
my
operation
although
novel
to
me
and
decidedly
useful
they
were
what
every
medical
man
well
knows
we
buried
the
poor
little
body
beneath
a
piece
of
luxuriant
turf
and
stole
back
into
cruces
like
guilty
things
but
the
knowledge
i
had
obtained
thus
strangely
was
very
valuable
to
me
and
was
soon
put
into
practice
but
that
i
dreaded
boring
my
readers
i
would
fain
give
them
some
idea
of
my
treatment
of
this
terrible
disease
i
have
no
doubt
that
at
first
i
made
some
lamentable
blunders
and
may
be
lost
patients
which
a
little
later
i
could
have
saved
i
know
i
came
across
the
other
day
some
notes
of
cholera
medicines
which
made
me
shudder
and
i
dare
say
they
have
been
used
in
their
turn
and
found
wanting
the
simplest
remedies
were
perhaps
the
best
mustard
plasters
and
emetics
and
calomel
the
mercury
applied
externally
where
the
veins
were
nearest
the
surface
were
my
usual
resources
opium
i
rather
dreaded
as
its
effect
is
to
incapacitate
the
system
from
making
any
exertion
and
it
lulls
the
patient
into
a
sleep
which
is
often
the
sleep
of
death
when
my
patients
felt
thirsty
i
would
give
them
water
in
which
cinnamon
had
been
boiled
one
stubborn
attack

to
an
additional
dose
of
ten
grains
of
sugar
of

of

a
every
quarter
of
an
hour
another
patient
a
girl
i
rubbed
over
with
warm
oil
camphor
and
spirits

wine
above
all
i
never
neglected
to
apply
mustard
poultices
to
the
stomach
spine
and
neck
and
particularly
to
keep
my
patient
warm
about
the
region
of
the
heart
nor
did
i
relax
my
care
when
the
disease
had
passed
by
for
danger
did
not
cease
when
the
great
foe
was
beaten
off
the
patient
was
left
prostrate
strengthening
medicines
had
to
be
given
cautiously
for
fever
often
of
the
brain
would
follow
but
after
all
one
great
conclusion
which
my
practice
in
cholera
cases
enabled
me
to
come
to
was
the
old
one
that
few
constitutions
permitted
the
use
of
exactly
similar
remedies
and
that
the
course
of
treatment
which
saved
one
man
would
if
persisted
in
have
very
likely
killed
his
brother
generally
speaking
the
cholera
showed
premonitory
symptoms
such
as
giddiness
sickness
diarrhoea
or
sunken
eyes
and
distressed
look
but
sometimes
the
substance
followed
its
forecoming
shadow
so
quickly
and
the
crisis
was
so
rapid
that
there
was
no
time
to
apply
any
remedies
an
american
carpenter
complained
of
giddiness
and
sickness
warning
signs
succeeded
so
quickly
by
the
worst
symptoms
of
cholera
that
in
less
than
an
hour
his
face
became
of
an
indigo
tint
his
limbs
were
doubled
up
horribly
with
violent
cramps
and
he
died
to
the
convicts
and
if
there
could
be
grades
of
wretchedness
in
cruces
these
poor
creatures
were
the
lowest
belonged
the
terrible
task
of
burying
the
dead
a
duty
to
which
they
showed
the
utmost
repugnance
not
unfrequently
at
some
fancied
alarm
they
would
fling
down
their
burden
until
at
last
it
became
necessary
to
employ
the
soldiers
to
see
that
they
discharged
the
task
allotted
to
them
ordinarily
the
victims
were
buried
immediately
after
death
with
such
imperfect
rites
of
sepulture
as
the
harassed
frightened
priests
would
pay
them
and
very
seldom
was
time
afforded
by
the
authorities
to
the
survivors
to
pay
those
last
offices
to
the
departed
which
a
spaniard
and
a
catholic
considers
so
important
once
i
was
present
at
a
terrible
scene
in
the
house
of
a
new
granada
grandee
whose
pride
and
poverty
justified
many
of
the
old
spanish
proverbs
levelled
at
his
caste
it
was
when
the
cholera
was
at
its
height
and
yet
he
had
left
perhaps
on
important
business
his
wife
and
family
and
gone
to
panama
for
three
days
on
the
day
after
his
departure
the
plague
broke
out
in
his
house
and
my
services
were
required
promptly
i
found
the
miserable
household
in
terrible
alarm
and
yet
confining
their
exertions
to
praying
to
a
coarse
black
priest
in
a
black
surplice
who
kneeling
beside
the
couch
of
the
spanish
lady
was
praying
in
his
turn
to
some
favourite
saint
in
cruces
the
sufferer
was
a
beautiful
woman
suffering
from
a
violent
attack
of
cholera
with
no
one
to
help
her
or
even
to
take
from
her
arms
the
poor
little
child
they
had
allowed
her
to
retain
in
her
intervals
of
comparative
freedom
from
pain
her
cries
to
the
madonna
and
her
husband
were
heartrending
to
hear
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
rout
the
stupid
priest
and
his
as
stupid
worshippers
and
do
what
i
could
for
the
sufferer
it
was
very
little
and
before
long
the
unconscious
spaniard
was
a
widower
soon
after
the
authorities
came
for
the
body
i
never
saw
such
passionate
anger
and
despair
as
were
shown
by
her
relatives
and
servants
old
and
young
at
the
intrusion
rage
that
she
who
had
been
so
exalted
in
life
should
go
to
her
grave
like
the
poor
poor
clay
she
was
orders
were
given
to
bar
the
door
against
the
convict
gang
who
had
come
to
discharge
their
unpleasant
duty
and
while
all
were
busy
decking
out
the
unconscious
corpse
in
gayest
attire
none
paid
any
heed
to
me
bending
over
the
fire
with
the
motherless
child
journeying
fast
to
join
its
dead
parent
i
had
made
more
than
one
effort
to
escape
for
i
felt
more
sick
and
wretched
than
at
any
similar
scene
of
woe
but
finding
exit
impossible
i
turned
my
back
upon
them
and
attended
to
the
dying
child
nor
did
i
heed
their
actions
until
i
heard
orders
given
to
admit
the
burial
party
and
then
i
found
that
they
had
dressed
the
corpse
in
rich
white
satin
and
decked
her
head
with
flowers
the
agitation
and
excitement
of
this
scene
had
affected
me
as
no
previous
horror
had
done
and
i
could
not
help
fancying
that
symptoms
were
showing
themselves
in
me
with
which
i
was
familiar
enough
in
others
leaving
the
dying
infant
to
the
care
of
its
relatives
when
the
spaniard
returned
he
found
himself
widowed
and
childless
i
hastened
to
my
brother
house
when
there
i
felt
an
unpleasant
chill
come
over
me
and
went
to
bed
at
once
other
symptoms
followed
quickly
and
before
nightfall
i
knew
full
well
that
my
turn
had
come
at
last
and
that
the
cholera
had
attacked
me
perhaps
its
greatest
foe

an
hotel
in
cruces
my
customers
lola
montes
miss
hayes
and
the
bishop
gambling
in
cruces
quarrels
amongst
the
travellers
new
granada
military
the
thieves
of
cruces
a
narrow
escape
when
it
became
known
that
their
yellow
doctress
had
the
cholera
i
must
do
the
people
of
cruces
the
justice
to
say
that
they
gave
her
plenty
of
sympathy
and
would
have
shown
their
regard
for
her
more
actively
had
there
been
any
occasion
indeed
when
i
most
wanted
quiet
it
was
difficult
to
keep
out
the
sympathising
americans
and
sorrowing
natives
who
came
to
inquire
after
me
and
who
not
content
with
making
their
inquiries
and
leaving
their
offerings
of
blankets
flannel
must
see
with
their
own
eyes
what
chance
the
yellow
woman
had
of
recovery
the
rickety
door
of
my
little
room
could
never
be
kept
shut
for
many
minutes
together
a
visitor
would
open
it
silently
poke
his
long
face
in
with
an
expression
of
sympathy
that
almost
made
me
laugh
in
spite
of
my
pain
draw
it
out
again
between
the
narrowest
possible
opening
as
if
he
were
anxious
to
admit
as
little
air
as
he
could
while
another
would
come
in
bodily
and
after
looking
at
me
curiously
and
inquisitively
as
he
would
eye
a
horse
or
nigger
he
had
some
thoughts
of
making
a
bid
for
would
help
to
carpet
my
room
with
the
result
perhaps
of
his
meditations
and
saying
gravely
air
you
better
aunty
seacole
now
is
there
a
something
we
can
du
for
you
would
as
gravely
give
place
to
another
and
another
yet
until
i
was
almost
inclined
to
throw
something
at
them
or
call
them
bad
names
like
the
scotch
king
does
the
ghosts
in
the
play
a
but
fortunately
the
attack
was
a
very
mild
one
and
by
the
next
day
all
danger
had
gone
by
although
i
still
felt
weak
and
exhausted
after
a
few
weeks
the
first
force
of
the
cholera
was
spent
and
although
it
lingered
with
us
as
though
loath
to
leave
so
fine
a
for
some
months
it
no
longer
gave
us
much
alarm
and
before
long
life
went
on
as
briskly
and
selfishly
as
ever
with
the
cruces
survivors
and
the
terrible
past
was
conveniently
forgotten
perhaps
it
is
so
everywhere
but
the
haste
with
which
the
cruces
people
buried
their
memory
seemed
indecent
old
houses
found
new
masters
the
mules
new
drivers
the
great
spaniard
chose
another
pretty
woman
and
had
a
grand
poor
dirty
wedding
and
was
married
by
the
same
lazy
black
priest
who
had
buried
his
wife
dead
a
few
months
back
and
very
likely
they
would
all
have
hastened
as
quickly
to
forget
their
doctress
had
circumstances
permitted
them
but
every
now
and
then
one
of
them
sickened
and
died
of
the
old
complaint
and
the
reputation
i
had
established
founded
for
me
a
considerable
practice
the
americans
in
the
place
gladly
retained
me
as
their
medical
attendant
and
in
one
way
or
other
gave
me
plenty
to
do
but
in
addition
to
this
i
determined
to
follow
my
original
scheme
of
keeping
an
hotel
in
cruces
right
opposite
my
brother
independent
hotel
there
was
a
place
to
let
which
it
was
considered
i
could
adapt
to
my
purpose
it
was
a
mere
hut
with
wattled
sides
and
a
rotten
thatched
roof
containing
two
rooms
one
small
enough
to
serve
as
a
bedroom
for
this
charming
residence
very
openly
situated
and
well
ventilated
twenty
pounds
a
month
was
considered
a
fair
and
by
no
means
exorbitant
rent
and
yet
i
was
glad
to
take
possession
of
it
and
in
a
few
days
had
hung
its
rude
walls
with
calico
of
gayest
colour
in
stripes
with
an
exuberance
of
fringes
frills
and
bows
the
americans
love
show
dearly
and
prepared
it
to
accommodate
fifty
dinner
guests
i
had
determined
that
it
should
be
simply
a
and
that
i
would
receive
no
lodgers
once
and
once
only
i
relaxed
this
rule
in
favour
of
two
american
women
who
sent
me
to
sleep
by
a
lengthy
quarrel
of
words
woke
me
in
the
night
to
witness
its
crisis
in
a
fisticuff
and
left
in
the
morning
after
having
taken
a
fancy
to
some
of
my
moveables
which
were
most
easily
removeable
i
had
on
my
staff
my
black
servant
mac
the
little
girl
i
have
before
alluded
to
and
a
native
cook
i
had
had
many
opportunities
of
seeing
how
my
brother
conducted
his
business
and
adopted
his
tariff
of
charges
for
an
ordinary
dinner
my
charge
was
four
shillings
eggs
and
chickens
were
as
i
have
before
said
distinct
luxuries
and
fetched
high
prices
four
crowds
generally
passed
through
cruces
every
month
in
these
were
to
be
found
passengers
to
and
from
chili
peru
and
lima
as
well
as
california
and
america
the
distance
from
cruces
to
panama
was
not
great
only
twenty
miles
in
fact
but
the
journey
from
the
want
of
roads
and
the
roughness
of
the
country
was
a
most
fatiguing
one
in
some
parts
as
i
found
when
i
made
the
journey
in
company
with
my
brother
it
was
almost
impassable
and
for
more
than
half
the
distance
three
miles
an
hour
was
considered
splendid
progress
the
great
majority
of
the
travellers
were
rough
rude
men
of
dirty
quarrelsome
habits
the
others
were
more
civilized
and
more
dangerous
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
grew
very
tired
of
life
in
cruces
although
i
made
money
rapidly
and
pressed
my
brother
to
return
to
kingston
poor
fellow
it
would
have
been
well
for
him
had
he
done
so
for
he
stayed
only
to
find
a
grave
on
the
isthmus
of
panama
the
company
at
my
was
not
over
select
and
it
was
often
very
difficult
for
an
unprotected
female
to
manage
them
although
i
always
did
my
best
to
put
them
in
good
humour
among
other
comforts
i
used
to
hire
a
black
barber
for
the
rather
large
consideration
of
two
pounds
to
shave
my
male
guests
you
can
scarcely
conceive
the
pleasure
and
comfort
an
american
feels
in
a
clean
chin
and
i
believe
my
barber
attracted
considerable
custom
to
the
british
hotel
at
cruces
i
had
a
little
erected
for
his
especial
convenience
and
there
well
provided
with
towels
and
armed
with
plenty
of
razors
a
brush
of
extraordinary
size
and
a
foaming
sea
of
lather
josé
shaved
the
the
rivalry
to
get
within
reach
of
his
huge
brush
was
very
great
and
the
threats
used
by
the
neglected
when
the
grinning
black
was
considered
guilty
of
any
interested
partiality
were
of
the
fiercest
description
this
duty
over
they
and
their
coarser
female
companions
many
of
them
well
known
to
us
for
they
travelled
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
isthmus
hanging
on
to
the
foolish
attacked
the
dinner
very
often
with
great
lack
of
decency
it
was
no
use
giving
them
and
forks
for
very
often
they
laid
their
own
down
to
insert
a
dirty
hairy
hand
into
a
full
dish
while
the
floor
soon
bore
evidences
of
the
great
national
american
habit
of
expectoration
very
often
quarrels
would
arise
during
the
progress
of
dinner
and
more
than
once
i
thought
the
knives
which
they
nearly
swallowed
at
every
mouthful
would
have
been
turned
against
one
another
it
was
i
always
thought
extremely
fortunate
that
the
reckless
men
rarely
stimulated
their
excitable
passions
with
strong
drink
tea
and
coffee
were
the
common
beverages
of
the
americans
englishmen
and
men
of
other
nations
being
generally
distinguishable
by
their
demand
for
wine
and
spirits
but
the
yankee
capacity
for
swilling
tea
and
coffee
was
prodigious
i
saw
one
man
drink
ten
cups
of
coffee
and
finding
his
appetite
still
unsatisfied
i
ran
across
to
my
brother
for
advice
there
was
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eyes
as
he
whispered
i
always
put
in
a
good
spoonful
of
salt
after
the
sixth
cup
it
chokes
them
off
admirably
it
was
no
easy
thing
to
avoid
being
robbed
and
cheated
by
the
less
scrupulous
travellers
although
i
think
it
was
only
the
yankee
who
stood
any
fair
chance
of
outwitting
me
i
remember
an
instance
of
the
biter
bit
which
i
will
narrate
hoping
it
may
make
my
reader
laugh
as
heartily
as
its
recollection
makes
me
he
was
a
tall
thin
yankee
with
a
furtive
glance
of
the
eyes
and
an
amazing
appetite
which
he
seemed
nothing
loath
to
indulge
his
appetite
for
eggs
especially
seemed
unbounded
now
i
have
more
than
once
said
how
expensive
eggs
were
and
this
day
they
happened
to
be
eightpence
apiece
our
plan
was
to
charge
every
diner
according
to
the
number
of
shells
found
upon
his
plate
now
i
noticed
how
eagerly
my
thin
guest
attacked
my
eggs
and
marvelled
somewhat
at
the
scanty
pile
of
shells
before
him
my
suspicions
once
excited
i
soon
fathomed
my
yankee
friend
dodge
as
soon
as
he
had
devoured
the
eggs
he
conveyed
furtively
the
shells
beneath
the
table
and
distributed
them
impartially
at
the
feet
of
his
companions
i
gave
my
little
black
maid
a
piece
of
chalk
and
instructions
and
creeping
under
the
table
she
counted
the
scattered
shells
and
chalked
the
number
on
the
tail
of
his
coat
and
when
he
came
up
to
pay
his
score
he
gave
up
his
number
of
eggs
in
a
loud
voice
and
when
i
contradicted
him
and
referred
to
the
in
corroboration
of
score
there
was
a
general
laugh
against
him
but
there
was
a
nasty
expression
in
his
eyes
and
an
unpleasant
allusion
to
mine
which
were
not
agreeable
and
dissuaded
me
from
playing
any
more
practical
jokes
upon
the
yankees
i
followed
my
brother
example
closely
and
forbade
all
gambling
in
my
hotel
but
i
got
some
idea
of
its
fruits
from
the
cases
brought
to
me
for
surgical
treatment
from
the
faro
and
monte
tables
gambling
at
cruces
and
on
the
isthmus
generally
was
a
business
by
which
money
was
wormed
out
of
the
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
render
it
attractive
as
i
have
seen
done
elsewhere
the
was
often
plainer
than
our
hotels
and
but
for
the
green
tables
with
their
piles
of
money
and
watched
over
by
a
determined
banker
and
the
eager
gamblers
around
you
would
not
know
that
you
were
in
the
vicinity
of
a
spot
which
the
english
at
home
designate
by
a
very
decided
and
extreme
name
a
casey
everybody
familiar
with
the
americans
knows
their
fondness
for
titles
owned
the
most
favoured
table
in
cruces
and
this
although
he
was
known
to
be
a
reckless
and
unscrupulous
villain
most
of
them
knew
that
he
had
been
hunted
out
of
san
francisco
and
at
that
time
years
before
the
vigilance
committee
commenced
their
labours
of
purification
a
man
too
bad
for
that
city
must
have
been
a
prodigy
of
crime
and
yet
and
although
he
was
and
had
a
knack
of
referring
the
slightest
dispute
to
his
revolver
his
table
was
always
crowded
probably
because
the
greatest
rogues
have
some
good
qualities
he
was
honest
in
his
way
and
played
fairly
occasionally
some
distinguished
passengers
passed
on
the
upward
and
downward
tides
of
rascality
and
ruffianism
that
swept
periodically
through
cruces
came
one
day
lola
montes
in
the
full
zenith
of
her
evil
fame
bound
for
california
with
a
strange
suite
a
bold
woman
with
fine
bad
eyes
and
a
determined
bearing
dressed
ostentatiously
in
perfect
male
attire
with
turned
down
over
a
velvet
lapelled
coat
richly
worked
black
hat
french
unmentionables
and
natty
polished
boots
with
spurs
she
carried
in
her
hand
a
handsome
which
she
could
use
as
well
in
the
streets
of
cruces
as
in
the
towns
of
europe
for
an
impertinent
american
presuming
perhaps
not
unnaturally
upon
her
reputation
laid
hold
jestingly
of
the
tails
of
her
long
coat
and
as
a
lesson
received
a
cut
across
his
face
that
must
have
marked
him
for
some
days
i
did
not
wait
to
see
the
row
that
followed
and
was
glad
when
the
wretched
woman
rode
off
on
the
following
morning
a
very
different
notoriety
followed
her
at
some
interval
of
time
miss
catherine
hayes
on
her
successful
singing
tour
who
disappointed
us
all
by
refusing
to
sing
at
cruces
and
after
her
came
an
english
bishop
from
australia
who
need
have
been
a
member
of
the
church
militant
to
secure
his
pretty
wife
from
the
host
of
admirers
she
had
gained
during
her
day
journey
from
panama
very
quarrelsome
were
the
majority
of
the
crowds
holding
life
cheap
as
all
bad
men
strangely
do
equally
prepared
to
take
or
lose
it
upon
the
slightest
provocation
few
tales
of
horror
in
panama
could
be
questioned
on
the
ground
of
improbability
not
less
partial
were
many
of
the
natives
of
cruces
to
the
use
of
the
knife
preferring
by
the
way
to
administer
sly
stabs
in
the
back
when
no
one
was
by
to
see
the
dastard
blow
dealt
terribly
bullied
by
the
americans
were
the
boatmen
and
muleteers
who
were
reviled
shot
and
stabbed
by
these
free
and
independent
filibusters
who
would
fain
whop
all
creation
abroad
as
they
do
their
slaves
at
home
whenever
any
englishmen
were
present
and
in
a
position
to
interfere
with
success
this
bullying
was
checked
and
they
found
instead
of
the
poor
spanish
indians
foemen
worthy
of
their
steel
or
lead
i
must
do
them
credit
to
say
that
they
were
never
loath
to
fight
any
one
that
desired
that
passing
excitement
and
thought
little
of
ending
their
journey
of
life
abruptly
at
the
wretched
wayside
town
of
cruces
it
very
often
happened
so
and
over
many
a
hasty
head
and
ready
hand
have
i
seen
the
sod
roughly
pressed
down
their
hot
hearts
stilled
suddenly
in
some
senseless
quarrel
and
so
in
time
i
grew
to
have
some
considerable
experience
in
the
treatment
of
knife
and
wounds
one
night
i
heard
a
great
noise
outside
my
window
and
on
rising
found
a
poor
boatman
moaning
piteously
and
in
a
strange
jumble
of
many
languages
begging
me
to
help
him
at
first
i
was
afraid
to
open
the
door
on
account
of
the
noisy
mob
which
soon
joined
him
for
villainy
was
very
shrewd
at
cruces
but
at
last
i
admitted
him
and
found
that
the
poor
wretch
ears
had
been
cruelly
split
by
some
hasty
citizen
of
the
united
states
i
stitched
them
up
as
well
as
i
could
and
silenced
his
cries
and
at
any
time
if
you
happened
to
be
near
the
river
when
a
crowd
were
arriving
or
departing
your
ears
would
be
regaled
with
a
choice
chorus
of
threats
of
which
and
the
application
of
revolvers
were
the
mildest
against
the
negroes
of
whom
there
were
many
in
the
isthmus
and
who
almost
invariably
filled
the
municipal
offices
and
took
the
lead
in
every
way
the
yankees
had
a
strong
prejudice
but
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
freedom
and
equality
elevate
men
and
the
same
negro
who
perhaps
in
tennessee
would
have
cowered
like
a
beaten
child
or
dog
beneath
an
american
uplifted
hand
would
face
him
boldly
here
and
by
equal
courage
and
superior
physical
strength
cow
his
old
oppressor
when
more
than
ordinary
squabbles
occurred
in
the
street
or
at
the
the
assistance
of
the
of
new
granada
was
called
in
and
the
affair
sometimes
assumed
the
character
of
a
regular
skirmish
the
soldiers
i
wish
i
could
speak
better
of
them
were
a
dirty
cowardly
indolent
set
more
prone
to
use
their
knives
than
their
legitimate
arms
and
bore
old
rusty
muskets
and
very
often
marched
unshod
their
officers
were
in
outward
appearance
a
few
shades
superior
to
the
men
they
commanded
but
as
respects
military
proficiency
were
their
equals
add
to
this
description
of
their
the
fact
that
you
might
commit
the
grossest
injustice
and
could
obtain
the
simplest
justice
only
by
lavish
bribery
and
you
may
form
some
idea
of
our
military
protectors
very
practised
and
skilful
in
thieving
were
the
native
population
of
cruces
i
speak
of
the
majority
and
except
the
negroes
always
more
inclined
to
do
a
dishonest
night
labour
at
great
risk
than
an
honest
day
work
for
fair
wages
for
justice
was
always
administered
strictly
to
the
poor
natives
it
was
only
the
foreigners
who
could
evade
it
or
purchase
exemption
punishment
was
severe
and
in
extreme
cases
the
convicts
were
sent
to
carthagena
there
to
suffer
imprisonment
of
a
terrible
character
indeed
from
what
i
heard
of
the
new
granada
prisons
i
thought
no
other
country
could
match
them
and
continued
to
think
so
until
i
read
how
the
ingenuity
in
cruelty
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
naples
put
the
torturers
of
the
new
granada
republic
to
the
blush
i
generally
avoided
claiming
the
protection
of
the
law
whilst
on
the
isthmus
for
i
found
it
was
as
is
the
case
in
civilized
england
from
other
causes
rather
an
expensive
luxury
once
only
i
took
a
thief
caught
in
the
act
before
the
alcalde
and
claimed
the
administration
of
justice
the
was
a
low
bamboo
shed
before
which
some
dirty
soldiers
were
lounging
and
inside
the
alcalde
a
negro
was
reclining
in
a
dirty
hammock
smoking
coolly
hearing
evidence
and
pronouncing
judgment
upon
the
wretched
culprits
who
were
trembling
before
his
dusky
majesty
i
had
attended
him
while
suffering
from
an
attack
of
cholera
and
directly
he
saw
me
he
rose
from
his
hammock
and
received
me
in
a
ceremonious
grand
manner
and
gave
orders
that
coffee
should
be
brought
to
me
he
had
a
very
pretty
white
wife
who
joined
us
and
then
the
alcalde
politely
offered
me
a
having
declined
which
he
listened
to
my
statement
with
great
attention
all
this
however
did
not
prevent
my
leaving
the
necessary
fee
in
furtherance
of
justice
nor
his
accepting
it
its
consequence
was
that
the
thief
instead
of
being
punished
as
a
criminal
was
ordered
to
pay
me
the
value
of
the
stolen
goods
which
after
weeks
of
hesitation
and
delay
she
eventually
did
in
pearls
combs
and
other
curiosities
whenever
an
american
was
arrested
by
the
new
granada
authorities
justice
had
a
hard
struggle
for
the
mastery
and
rarely
obtained
it
once
i
was
present
at
the
when
an
american
was
brought
in
heavily
ironed
charged
with
having
committed
a
highway
robbery
if
i
may
use
the
term
where
there
were
no
roads
on
some
travellers
from
chili
around
the
frightened
soldiers
swelled
an
angry
crowd
of
brother
americans
abusing
and
threatening
the
authorities
in
no
measured
terms
all
of
them
indignant
that
a
nigger
should
presume
to
judge
one
of
their
countrymen
at
last
their
violence
so
roused
the
sleepy
alcalde
that
he
positively
threw
himself
from
his
hammock
laid
down
his
cigarito
and
gave
such
very
determined
orders
to
his
soldiers
that
he
succeeded
in
checking
the
riot
then
with
an
air
of
decision
that
puzzled
everybody
he
addressed
the
crowd
declaring
angrily
that
since
the
americans
came
the
country
had
known
no
peace
that
robberies
and
crimes
of
every
sort
had
increased
and
ending
by
expressing
his
determination
to
make
strangers
respect
the
laws
of
the
republic
and
to
retain
the
prisoner
and
if
found
guilty
punish
him
as
he
deserved
the
americans
seemed
too
astonished
at
the
audacity
of
the
black
man
who
dared
thus
to
beard
them
to
offer
any
resistance
but
i
believe
that
the
prisoner
was
allowed
ultimately
to
escape
i
once
had
a
narrow
escape
from
the
thieves
of
cruces
i
had
been
down
to
chagres
for
some
stores
and
returning
late
in
the
evening
too
tired
to
put
away
my
packages
had
retired
to
rest
at
once
my
little
maid
who
was
not
so
fatigued
as
i
was
and
slept
more
lightly
woke
me
in
the
night
to
listen
to
a
noise
in
the
thatch
at
the
further
end
of
the
store
but
i
was
so
accustomed
to
hear
the
mules
of
cruces
munching
my
thatch
that
i
listened
lazily
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
went
unsuspiciously
into
another
heavy
sleep
i
do
not
know
how
long
it
was
before
i
was
again
awoke
by
the
child
loud
screams
and
cries
of
hombro
landro
and
sure
enough
by
the
light
of
the
dying
fire
i
saw
a
fellow
stealing
away
with
my
dress
in
the
pocket
of
which
was
my
purse
i
was
about
to
rush
forward
when
the
fire
gleamed
on
a
knife
in
his
hand
so
i
stood
still
and
screamed
loudly
hoping
to
arouse
my
brother
over
the
way
for
a
moment
the
thief
seemed
inclined
to
silence
me
and
had
taken
a
few
steps
forward
when
i
took
up
an
old
rusty
which
my
brother
had
given
me
that
i
might
look
determined
and
snatching
down
the
can
of
ground
coffee
proceeded
to
prime
it
still
screaming
as
loudly
as
my
strong
lungs
would
permit
until
the
rascal
turned
tail
and
stole
away
through
the
roof
the
thieves
usually
buried
their
spoil
like
dogs
as
they
were
but
this
fellow
had
only
time
to
hide
it
behind
a
bush
where
it
was
found
on
the
following
morning
and
claimed
by
me
footnote
a
seacole
very
likely
refers
to
macbeth
but
it
was

a

life

sympathy
with

casey

yankee
independence
and

i
remained
at
cruces
until
the
rainy
months
came
to
an
end
and
the
river
grew
too
shallow
to
be
navigable
by
the
boats
higher
up
than
gorgona
and
then
we
all
made
preparations
for
a
flitting
to
that
place
but
before
starting
it
appeared
to
be
the
custom
for
the
store
and
hotel
keepers
to
exchange
parting
visits
and
to
many
of
these
parties
i
in
virtue
of
my
recent
services
to
the
community
received
invitations
the
most
important
social
meeting
took
place
on
the
anniversary
of
the
declaration
of
american
independence
at
my
brother
hotel
where
a
score
of
zealous
americans
dined
most
heartily
as
they
never
fail
to
do
and
as
it
was
an
especial
occasion
drank
champagne
liberally
at
twelve
shillings
a
bottle
and
after
the
usual
patriotic
toasts
had
been
duly
honoured
they
proposed
the
ladies
with
an
especial
reference
to
myself
in
a
speech
which
i
thought
worth
noting
down
at
the
time
the
spokesman
was
a
thin
american
with
a
pompous
and
yet
rapid
delivery
and
a
habit
of
turning
over
his
words
with
his
quid
before
delivering
them
and
clearing
his
mouth
after
each
sentence
perhaps
to
make
room
for
the
next
i
shall
beg
the
reader
to
consider
that
the
blanks
express
the
time
expended
on
this
operation
he
dashed
into
his
work
at
once
rolling
up
and
getting
rid
of
his
sentences
as
he
went
on
well
gentlemen
i
expect
you
all
support
me
in
a
drinking
of
this
toast
that
i
du
aunty
seacole
gentlemen
i
give
you
aunty
seacole
we
ca
du
less
for
her
after
what
she
done
for
us
when
the
cholera
was
among
us
gentlemen
not
many
months
ago
so
i
say
god
bless
the
best
yaller
woman
he
ever
made
from
jamaica
gentlemen
from
the
isle
of
springs
well
gentlemen
i
expect
there
are
only
tu
things
we
vexed
for
and
the
first
is
that
she
ai
one
of
us
a
citizen
of
the
great
united
states
and
the
other
thing
is
gentlemen
that
providence
made
her
a
yaller
woman
i
calculate
gentlemen
you
all
as
vexed
as
i
am
that
she
not
wholly
white
but
i
du
reckon
on
your
rejoicing
with
me
that
she
so
many
shades
removed
from
being
entirely
black
and
i
guess
if
we
could
bleach
her
by
any
means
we
would
and
thus
make
her
as
acceptable
in
any
company
as
she
deserves
to
be
gentlemen
i
give
you
aunty
seacole
and
so
the
orator
sat
down
amidst
much
applause
it
may
be
supposed
that
i
did
not
need
much
persuasion
to
return
thanks
burning
as
i
was
to
tell
them
my
mind
on
the
subject
of
my
colour
indeed
if
my
brother
had
not
checked
me
i
should
have
given
them
my
thoughts
somewhat
too
freely
as
it
was
i
said
gentlemen
i
return
you
my
best
thanks
for
your
kindness
in
drinking
my
health
as
for
what
i
have
done
in
cruces
providence
evidently
made
me
to
be
useful
and
i
ca
help
it
but
i
must
say
that
i
do
altogether
appreciate
your
friend
kind
wishes
with
respect
to
my
complexion
if
it
had
been
as
dark
as
any
nigger
i
should
have
been
just
as
happy
and
as
useful
and
as
much
respected
by
those
whose
respect
i
value
and
as
to
his
offer
of
bleaching
me
i
should
even
if
it
were
practicable
decline
it
without
any
thanks
as
to
the
society
which
the
process
might
gain
me
admission
into
all
i
can
say
is
that
judging
from
the
specimens
i
have
met
with
here
and
elsewhere
i
do
think
that
i
shall
lose
much
by
being
excluded
from
it
so
gentlemen
i
drink
to
you
and
the
general
reformation
of
american
manners
i
do
not
think
that
they
altogether
admired
my
speech
but
i
was
a
somewhat
privileged
person
and
they
laughed
at
it
enough
perhaps
for
i
was
not
in
the
best
humour
myself
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
if
they
had
been
angry
rightly
i
ought
to
have
gone
down
to
gorgona
a
few
weeks
before
cruces
was
deserted
and
secured
an
hotel
but
i
did
not
give
up
all
hope
of
persuading
my
brother
to
leave
the
isthmus
until
the
very
last
moment
and
then
of
course
a
suitable
house
was
not
to
be
hired
in
gorgona
for
love
or
money
seeing
his
fixed
determination
to
stay
i
consented
to
remain
with
him
for
he
was
young
and
often
ill
and
set
hard
to
work
to
settle
myself
somewhere
with
the
aid
of
an
old
jamaica
friend
who
had
settled
at
gorgona
i
at
last
found
a
miserable
little
hut
for
sale
and
bought
it
for
a
hundred
dollars
it
consisted
of
one
room
only
and
was
in
its
then
condition
utterly
unfit
for
my
purpose
but
i
determined
to
set
to
work
and
build
on
to
it
by
no
means
the
hazardous
speculation
in
gorgona
where
bricks
and
mortar
are
unknown
that
it
is
in
england
the
alcalde
permission
to
make
use
of
the
adjacent
ground
was
obtained
for
a
moderate
consideration
and
plenty
of
material
was
procurable
from
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
an
american
whom
i
had
cured
of
the
cholera
at
cruces
lent
me
his
boat
and
i
hired
two
or
three
natives
to
cut
down
and
shape
the
posts
and
bamboo
poles
directly
these
were
raised
mac
and
my
little
maid
set
to
work
and
filled
up
the
spaces
between
them
with
split
bamboo
canes
and
reeds
and
before
long
my
new
hotel
was
ready
to
be
roofed
the
building
process
was
simple
enough
and
i
soon
found
myself
in
possession
of
a
capital
some
thirty
feet
in
length
which
was
gaily
hung
with
coloured
calico
concealing
all
defects
of
construction
and
lighted
with
large
oil
lamps
a
bar
and
a
small
private
apartment
for
ladies
altogether
although
i
had
to
pay
my
labourers
four
shillings
a
day
the
whole
building
did
not
cost
me
more
than
my
brother
paid
for
three
rent
of
his
hotel
i
gave
the
travelling
world
to
understand
that
i
intended
to
devote
my
establishment
principally
to
the
entertainment
of
ladies
and
the
care
of
those
who
might
fall
ill
on
the
route
and
i
found
the
scheme
answered
admirably
and
yet
although
the
speculation
paid
well
i
soon
grew
as
weary
of
my
life
in
gorgona
as
i
had
been
at
cruces
and
when
i
found
my
brother
proof
against
all
persuasion
to
quit
the
isthmus
i
began
to
entertain
serious
thoughts
of
leaving
him
nor
was
it
altogether
my
old
roving
inclination
which
led
me
to
desire
a
change
although
i
dare
say
it
had
something
to
do
with
it
my
present
life
was
not
agreeable
for
a
woman
with
the
least
delicacy
or
refinement
and
of
female
society
i
had
none
indeed
the
females
who
crossed
my
path
were
about
as
unpleasant
specimens
of
the
fair
sex
as
one
could
well
wish
to
avoid
with
very
few
exceptions
those
who
were
not
bad
were
very
disagreeable
and
as
the
majority
came
from
the
southern
states
of
america
and
showed
an
instinctive
repugnance
against
any
one
whose
countenance
claimed
for
her
kindred
with
their
slaves
my
position
was
far
from
a
pleasant
one
not
that
it
ever
gave
me
any
annoyance
they
were
glad
of
my
stores
and
comforts
i
made
money
out
of
their
wants
nor
do
i
think
our
bond
of
connection
was
ever
closer
only
this
if
any
of
them
came
to
me
sick
and
suffering
i
say
this
out
of
simple
justice
to
myself
i
forgot
everything
except
that
she
was
my
sister
and
that
it
was
my
duty
to
help
her
i
may
have
before
said
that
the
citizens
of
the
new
granada
republic
had
a
strong
prejudice
against
all
americans
it
is
not
difficult
to
assign
a
cause
for
this
in
the
first
place
many
of
the
negroes
fugitive
from
the
southern
states
had
sought
refuge
in
this
and
the
other
states
of
central
america
where
every
profession
was
open
to
them
and
as
they
were
generally
superior
men
evinced
perhaps
by
their
hatred
of
their
old
condition
and
their
successful
flight
they
soon
rose
to
positions
of
eminence
in
new
granada
in
the
priesthood
in
the
army
in
all
municipal
offices
the
negroes
were
invariably
found
in
the
foremost
rank
and
the
people
for
some
reason
perhaps
because
they
recognised
in
them
superior
talents
for
administration
always
respected
them
more
than
and
preferred
them
to
their
native
rulers
so
that
influenced
naturally
by
these
freed
slaves
who
bore
themselves
before
their
old
masters
bravely
and
like
men
the
new
granada
people
were
strongly
prejudiced
against
the
americans
and
in
the
second
and
third
places
they
feared
their
quarrelsome
bullying
habits
be
it
remembered
that
the
crowds
to
california
were
of
the
lowest
sorts
many
of
whom
have
since
fertilised
cuban
and
nicaraguan
soil
and
dreaded
their
schemes
for
annexation
to
such
an
extent
was
this
amusingly
carried
that
when
the
american
railway
company
took
possession
of
navy
bay
and
christened
it
aspinwall
after
the
name
of
their
chairman
the
native
authorities
refused
to
recognise
their
right
to
name
any
portion
of
the
republic
and
pertinaciously
returned
all
letters
directed
to
aspinwall
with
no
such
place
known
marked
upon
them
in
the
very
spot
for
which
they
were
intended
and
in
addition
to
this
the
legal
authorities
refused
to
compel
any
defendant
to
appear
who
was
described
as
of
aspinwall
and
put
every
plaintiff
out
of
court
who
described
himself
as
residing
in
that
unrecognised
place
under
these
circumstances
my
readers
can
easily
understand
that
when
any
americans
crossed
the
isthmus
accompanied
by
their
slaves
the
cruces
and
gorgona
people
were
restlessly
anxious
to
whisper
into
their
ears
offers
of
freedom
and
hints
how
easy
escape
would
be
nor
were
the
authorities
at
all
inclined
to
aid
in
the
recapture
of
a
runaway
slave
so
that
as
it
was
necessary
for
the
losers
to
go
on
with
the
crowd
the
fugitive
invariably
escaped
it
is
one
of
the
maxims
of
the
new
granada
constitution
as
it
is
i
believe
of
the
english
that
on
a
slave
touching
its
soil
his
chains
fall
from
him
rather
than
irritate
so
dangerous
a
neighbour
as
america
this
rule
was
rarely
supported
but
i
remember
the
following
instance
of
its
successful
application
a
young
american
woman
whose
character
can
be
best
described
by
the
word
vicious
fell
ill
at
gorgona
and
was
left
behind
by
her
companions
under
the
charge
of
a
young
negro
her
slave
whom
she
treated
most
inhumanly
as
was
evinced
by
the
poor
girl
frequent
screams
when
under
the
lash
one
night
her
cries
were
so
distressing
that
gorgona
could
stand
it
no
longer
but
broke
into
the
house
and
found
the
chattel
bound
hand
and
foot
naked
and
being
severely
lashed
despite
the
threats
and
astonishment
of
the
mistress
they
were
both
carried
off
on
the
following
morning
before
the
alcalde
himself
a
man
of
colour
and
of
a
very
humane
disposition
when
the
particulars
of
the
case
were
laid
before
him
he
became
strongly
excited
and
called
upon
the
woman
to
offer
an
explanation
of
her
cruelty
she
treated
it
with
the
coolest
unconcern
the
girl
was
her
property
worth
so
many
dollars
and
a
child
at
new
orleans
had
misbehaved
herself
and
been
properly
corrected
the
alcalde
must
be
drunk
or
a
fool
or
both
together
to
interfere
between
an
american
and
her
property
her
coolness
vanished
however
when
the
alcalde
turned
round
to
the
girl
and
told
her
that
she
was
free
to
leave
her
mistress
when
she
liked
and
when
she
heard
the
irrepressible
cheering
of
the
crowded
at
the
alcalde
humanity
and
boldness
and
saw
the
slave
face
flush
with
delight
at
the
judge
words
she
became
terribly
enraged
made
use
of
the
most
fearful
threats
and
would
have
wreaked
summary
vengeance
on
her
late
chattel
had
not
the
clumsy
soldiery
interfered
then
with
demoniac
refinement
of
cruelty
she
bethought
herself
of
the
girl
baby
at
new
orleans
still
in
her
power
and
threatened
most
horrible
torture
to
the
child
if
its
mother
dared
to
accept
the
alcalde
offer
the
poor
girl
trembled
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
as
though
to
shut
out
some
fearful
sight
and
i
think
had
we
not
persuaded
her
to
the
contrary
that
she
would
have
sacrificed
her
newly
won
freedom
for
the
child
sake
but
we
knew
very
well
that
when
the
heat
of
passion
had
subsided
the
threatener
would
be
too
to
injure
her
own
property
and
at
once
set
afloat
a
subscription
for
the
purchase
of
the
child
the
issue
of
the
tale
i
do
not
know
as
the
woman
was
very
properly
removed
into
the
interior
of
the
country
life
at
gorgona
resembled
life
at
cruces
so
nearly
that
it
does
not
need
a
separate
description
down
with
the
store
and
hotel
keepers
came
the
muleteers
and
mules
porters
and
idlers
and
thieves
gamblers
and
dancing
women
and
soon
the
were
fitted
up
and
plying
their
deadly
trade
and
the
dancers
charmed
the
susceptible
travellers
as
successfully
in
the
dirty
streets
of
gorgona
as
they
had
previously
done
in
the
unwholesome
precincts
of
cruces
and
casey
was
very
nearly
getting
himself
into
serious
trouble
from
too
great
a
readiness
to
use
his
revolver
still
he
had
a
better
excuse
for
bloodshed
this
time
than
might
have
been
found
for
his
previous
breaches
of
the
sixth
commandment
among
the
desperadoes
who
frequented
his
during
their
short
stay
in
gorgona
was
conceived
the
desperate
plan
of
putting
out
the
lights
and
upsetting
casey
table
trusting
in
the
confusion
to
carry
off
the
piles
of
money
upon
it
the
first
part
of
their
programme
was
successfully
carried
out
but
the
second
was
frustrated
by
the
doctor
promptly
firing
his
revolver
into
the
dark
and
hitting
an
unoffending
boy
in
the
hip
and
at
this
crisis
the
gorgona
police
entered
carried
off
all
the
parties
they
could
lay
hands
upon
including
the
doctor
to
prison
and
brought
the
wounded
boy
to
me
on
the
following
morning
came
a
most
urgent
request
that
i
would
visit
the
imprisoned
doctor
i
found
him
desperately
angry
but
somewhat
nervous
too
for
the
alcalde
was
known
to
be
no
friend
to
the
americans
owed
casey
more
than
one
grudge
and
had
shown
recently
a
disposition
to
enforce
the
laws
i
say
seacole
how
that
boy
oh
casey
how
could
you
shoot
the
poor
lad
and
now
call
him
bad
names
as
though
he
injured
you
he
is
very
ill
indeed
may
die
so
i
advise
you
to
think
seriously
of
your
position
but
madame
seacole
this
in
a
very
altered
tone
surely
help
me
surely
tell
the
alcalde
that
the
wound
a
slight
one
he
a
friend
of
yours
and
will
let
me
out
of
this
hole
come
madame
seacole
you
never
leave
me
to
be
murdered
by
these
bloodthirsty
savages
what
can
i
do
or
say
casey
i
must
speak
the
truth
and
the
ball
is
still
in
the
poor
lad
hip
i
answered
for
i
enjoyed
the
fellow
fear
too
much
to
help
him
however
he
sent
some
of
his
friends
to
the
boy
father
and
bribed
him
to
take
the
lad
from
my
care
and
send
him
to
navy
bay
to
a
surgeon
there
of
course
he
never
returned
to
prosecute
casey
and
he
was
left
with
the
alcalde
only
to
deal
with
who
although
he
hated
the
man
could
not
resist
his
money
and
so
set
him
free
gorgona
lying
lower
than
cruces
its
inhabitants
more
frequently
enjoyed
the
excitement
of
a
flood
after
heavy
rains
the
river
would
rise
so
rapidly
that
in
a
few
hours
the
chief
part
of
the
place
would
be
under
water
on
such
occasions
the
scene
was
unusually
exciting
as
the
water
crept
up
the
street
the
frightened
householders
kept
removing
their
goods
and
furniture
to
higher
ground
while
here
and
there
where
the
waters
had
surrounded
them
unawares
boats
were
sent
to
their
rescue
the
houses
not
made
to
resist
much
wind
or
water
often
gave
way
and
were
carried
down
the
chagres
meanwhile
the
thieves
were
the
busiest
the
honest
folks
forgetting
the
true
old
adage
god
helps
those
who
help
themselves
confining
their
exertions
to
bringing
down
their
favourite
saints
to
the
water
edge
and
invoking
their
interposition
fortunately
my
hotel
was
at
the
upper
end
of
the
town
where
the
floods
had
been
rarely
known
to
extend
and
although
there
was
a
sufficient
chance
of
the
water
reaching
me
to
compel
me
to
have
all
my
stores
ready
packed
for
removal
i
escaped
some
distressing
losses
occurred
a
frenchman
a
near
neighbour
whose
house
was
surrounded
by
the
waters
before
he
could
remove
his
goods
grew
so
frantic
at
the
loss
that
he
obstinately
refused
to
quit
his
falling
house
and
some
force
had
to
be
used
before
they
could
save
his
life
scarcely
had
the
ravages
of
the
last
flood
been
repaired
when
fire
marked
gorgona
for
its
prey
the
conflagration
began
at
a
store
by
the
but
it
spread
rapidly
and
before
long
all
gorgona
was
in
danger
the
town
happened
to
be
very
full
that
night
two
crowds
having
met
there
and
there
was
great
confusion
but
at
last
the
lazy
aided
by
the
americans
succeeded
in
pulling
down
some
old
crazy
huts
and
checking
the
fire
progress
the
travellers
were
in
sore
plight
many
of
them
being
reduced
to
sleep
upon
their
luggage
piled
in
the
drenched
streets
my
hotel
had
some
interesting
inmates
for
a
poor
young
creature
borne
in
from
one
of
the
burning
houses
became
a
mother
during
the
night
and
a
stout
little
lassie
opened
its
eyes
upon
this
waesome
world
during
the
excitement
and
danger
of
a
gorgona
conflagration
shortly
after
this
tired
to
death
of
life
in
panama
i
handed
over
my
hotel
to
my
brother
and
returned
to
kingston
on
the
way
thither
i
experienced
another
instance
of
american
politeness
which
i
can
not
help
recording
first
reminding
my
readers
of
what
i
have
previously
said
of
the
character
of
the
californian
travellers
anxious
to
get
home
quickly
i
took
my
passage
in
the
first
steamer
that
left
navy
bay
an
american
one
and
late
in
the
evening
said
farewell
to
the
friends
i
had
been
staying
with
and
went
on
board
a
very
kind
friend
an
american
merchant
doing
a
large
business
at
navy
bay
had
tried
hard
to
persuade
me
to
delay
my
journey
until
the
english
company
steamer
called
without
however
giving
any
good
reasons
for
his
wish
so
with
mac
and
my
little
maid
i
passed
through
the
crowd
of
female
passengers
on
deck
and
sought
the
privacy
of
the
saloon
before
i
had
been
long
there
two
ladies
came
to
me
and
in
their
cool
straightforward
manner
questioned
me
where
air
you
going
to
kingston
and
how
air
you
going
by
sea
do
be
impertinent
yaller
woman
by
what
conveyance
air
you
going
by
this
steamer
of
course
i
paid
for
my
passage
they
went
away
with
this
information
and
in
a
short
time
eight
or
nine
others
came
and
surrounded
me
asking
the
same
questions
my
answers
and
i
was
very
particular
raised
quite
a
storm
of
uncomplimentary
remarks
guess
a
nigger
woman
do
go
along
with
us
in
this
saloon
said
one
i
never
travelled
with
a
nigger
yet
and
i
expect
i
sha
begin
now
said
another
while
some
children
had
taken
my
little
servant
mary
in
hand
and
were
practising
on
her
the
politenesses
which
their
parents
were
favouring
me
with
only
as
is
the
wont
of
children
they
were
crueller
i
can
not
help
it
if
i
shock
my
readers
but
the
is
that
one
positively
spat
in
poor
little
mary
frightened
yellow
face
at
last
an
old
american
lady
came
to
where
i
sat
and
gave
me
some
staid
advice
well
now
i
tell
you
for
your
good
you
better
quit
this
and
not
drive
my
people
to
extremities
if
you
do
you
be
sorry
for
it
i
expect
thus
harassed
i
appealed
to
the
stewardess
a
tall
woman
flat
and
thin
as
a
broomstick
she
asked
me
sundry
questions
as
to
how
and
when
i
had
taken
my
passage
until
tired
beyond
all
endurance
i
said
my
good
woman
put
me
anywhere
under
a
boat
in
your
so
that
i
can
get
to
kingston
somehow
but
the
stewardess
was
not
to
be
moved
there
nowhere
but
the
saloon
and
you
ca
expect
to
stay
with
the
white
people
that
clear
flesh
and
blood
can
stand
a
good
deal
of
aggravation
but
not
that
if
the
britishers
is
so
took
up
with
coloured
people
that
their
business
but
it
wo
do
here
this
last
remark
was
in
answer
to
an
englishman
whose
advice
to
me
was
not
to
leave
my
seat
for
any
of
them
he
made
matters
worse
until
at
last
i
lost
my
temper
and
calling
mac
bade
him
get
my
things
together
and
went
up
to
the
captain
a
good
honest
man
he
and
some
of
the
black
crew
and
the
black
cook
who
showed
his
teeth
most
viciously
were
much
annoyed
muttering
about
its
being
a
custom
of
the
country
the
captain
gave
me
an
order
upon
the
agent
for
the
money
i
had
paid
and
so
at
twelve
at
night
i
was
landed
again
upon
the
wharf
of
navy
bay
my
american
friends
were
vastly
annoyed
but
not
much
surprised
and
two
days
later
the
english
steamer
the
eagle
in
charge
of
my
old
friend
captain
b
touched
at
navy
bay
and
carried
me
to
kingston

journey

a
few
words
on
the
present
aspect
of
affairs
on
the
isthmus
of
panama
i
stayed
in
jamaica
eight
months
out
of
the
year
still
remembered
in
the
island
for
its
suffering
and
gloom
i
returned
just
in
time
to
find
my
services
with
many
others
needful
for
the
yellow
fever
never
made
a
more
determined
effort
to
exterminate
the
english
in
jamaica
than
it
did
in
that
dreadful
year
so
violent
was
the
epidemic
that
some
of
my
people
fell
victims
to
its
fury
a
thing
rarely
heard
of
before
my
house
was
full
of
sufferers
officers
their
wives
and
children
very
often
they
were
borne
in
from
the
ships
in
the
harbour
sometimes
in
a
dying
state
sometimes
after
long
and
distressing
struggles
with
the
grim
foe
to
recover
habituated
as
i
had
become
with
death
in
its
most
harrowing
forms
i
found
these
scenes
more
difficult
to
bear
than
any
i
had
previously
borne
a
part
in
and
for
this
reason
perhaps
that
i
had
not
only
to
cheer
the
of
the
sufferer
but
far
more
trying
task
to
soothe
the
passionate
grief
of
wife
or
husband
left
behind
it
was
a
terrible
thing
to
see
young
people
in
the
youth
and
bloom
of
life
suddenly
stricken
down
not
in
battle
with
an
enemy
that
threatened
their
country
but
in
vain
contest
with
a
climate
that
refused
to
adopt
them
indeed
the
mother
country
pays
a
dear
price
for
the
possession
of
her
colonies
i
think
all
who
are
familiar
with
the
west
indies
will
acknowledge
that
nature
has
been
favourable
to
strangers
in
a
few
respects
and
that
one
of
these
has
been
in
instilling
into
the
hearts
of
the
creoles
an
affection
for
english
people
and
an
anxiety
for
their
welfare
which
shows
itself
warmest
when
they
are
sick
and
suffering
i
can
safely
appeal
on
this
point
to
any
one
who
is
acquainted
with
life
in
jamaica
another
benefit
has
been
conferred
upon
them
by
inclining
the
creoles
to
practise
the
healing
art
and
inducing
them
to
seek
out
the
simple
remedies
which
are
available
for
the
terrible
diseases
by
which
foreigners
are
attacked
and
which
are
found
growing
under
the
same
circumstances
which
produce
the
ills
they
minister
to
so
true
is
it
that
beside
the
nettle
ever
grows
the
cure
for
its
sting
i
do
not
willingly
care
to
dwell
upon
scenes
of
suffering
and
death
but
it
is
with
such
scenes
that
my
life
experience
has
made
me
most
familiar
and
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
their
description
now
and
then
and
here
i
would
fain
record
in
humble
spirit
my
conclusions
drawn
from
the
bearing
of
those
whom
i
have
now
and
then
accompanied
a
little
distance
on
their
way
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
on
the
awful
and
important
question
of
religious
feeling
death
is
always
terrible
no
one
need
be
ashamed
to
fear
it
how
we
bear
it
depends
much
upon
our
constitutions
i
have
seen
some
brave
men
who
have
smiled
at
the
cruellest
amputation
die
trembling
like
children
while
others
whose
lives
have
been
spent
in
avoidance
of
the
least
danger
or
trouble
have
drawn
their
last
painful
breath
like
heroes
striking
at
their
foe
to
the
last
robbing
him
of
his
victory
and
making
their
defeat
a
triumph
but
i
can
not
trace
the
peace
and
resignation
which
i
have
witnessed
on
many
to
temperament
alone
although
i
believe
it
has
much
more
to
do
with
them
than
many
teachers
will
allow
i
have
stood
by
receiving
the
last
blessings
of
christians
and
closing
the
eyes
of
those
who
had
nothing
to
trust
to
but
the
mercy
of
a
god
who
will
be
far
more
merciful
to
us
than
we
are
to
one
another
and
i
say
decidedly
that
the
christian
death
is
the
glorious
one
as
is
his
life
you
can
never
find
a
good
man
who
is
not
a
worker
he
is
no
laggard
in
the
race
of
life
three
two
or
one
score
years
of
life
have
been
to
him
a
season
of
labour
in
his
appointed
sphere
and
as
the
work
of
the
hands
earns
for
us
sweet
rest
by
night
so
does
the
heart
labour
of
a
lifetime
make
the
repose
of
heaven
acceptable
this
is
my
experience
and
i
remember
one
death
of
a
man
whom
i
grew
to
love
in
a
few
short
weeks
the
thought
of
which
stirs
my
heart
now
and
has
sustained
me
in
seasons
of
great
danger
for
before
that
time
if
i
had
never
feared
death
i
had
not
learnt
to
meet
him
with
a
brave
smiling
face
and
this
he
taught
me
i
must
not
tell
you
his
name
for
his
friends
live
yet
and
have
been
kind
to
me
in
many
ways
one
of
them
we
shall
meet
on
crimean
soil
he
was
a
young
surgeon
and
as
busy
and
joyous
as
a
good
man
should
be
and
when
he
fell
ill
they
brought
him
to
my
house
where
i
nursed
him
and
grew
fond
of
him
almost
as
fond
as
the
poor
lady
his
mother
in
england
far
away
for
some
time
we
thought
him
safe
but
at
last
the
most
terrible
symptoms
of
the
cruel
disease
showed
themselves
and
he
knew
that
he
must
die
his
thoughts
were
never
for
himself
but
for
those
he
had
to
leave
behind
all
his
pity
was
for
them
it
was
trying
to
see
his
poor
hands
tremblingly
penning
the
last
few
words
of
trying
to
see
how
piteously
the
poor
worn
heart
longed
to
see
once
more
the
old
familiar
faces
of
the
loved
ones
in
unconscious
happiness
at
home
and
yet
i
had
to
support
him
while
this
sad
task
was
effected
and
to
give
him
all
the
help
i
could
i
think
he
had
some
fondness
for
me
or
perhaps
his
kind
heart
feigned
a
feeling
that
he
saw
would
give
me
joy
for
i
used
to
call
him
my
son
my
dear
child
and
to
weep
over
him
in
a
very
weak
and
silly
manner
perhaps
he
sent
for
an
old
friend
captain
s
and
when
he
came
i
had
to
listen
to
the
dictation
of
his
simple
will
his
dog
to
one
friend
his
ring
to
another
his
books
to
a
third
his
love
and
kind
wishes
to
all
and
that
over
my
poor
son
prepared
himself
to
die
a
child
in
all
save
a
man
calm
courage
he
beckoned
me
to
raise
him
in
the
bed
and
as
i
passed
my
arms
around
him
he
saw
the
tears
i
could
not
repress
rolling
down
my
brown
cheeks
and
thanked
me
with
a
few
words
let
me
lay
my
head
upon
your
breast
and
so
he
rested
now
and
then
speaking
lowly
to
himself
it
only
that
i
miss
my
mother
but
heaven
will
be
done
he
repeated
this
many
times
until
the
heaven
he
obeyed
sent
him
in
its
mercy
forgetfulness
and
his
thoughts
no
longer
wandered
to
his
earthly
home
i
heard
glad
words
feebly
uttered
as
i
bent
over
him
words
about
heaven
rest
rest
a
holy
name
many
times
repeated
and
then
with
a
smile
and
a
stronger
voice
home
home
and
so
in
a
little
while
my
arms
no
longer
held
him
i
have
a
little
gold
brooch
with
his
hair
in
it
now
i
wonder
what
inducement
could
be
strong
enough
to
cause
me
to
part
with
that
memorial
sent
me
by
his
mother
some
months
later
with
the
following
letter
my
dear
madam
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
accept
the
enclosed
trifle
in
remembrance
of
that
dear
son
whose
last
moments
were
soothed
by
your
kindness
and
as
a
mark
of
the
gratitude
of
my
dear
madam
your
ever
sincere
and
obliged
m
s
after
this
i
was
sent
for
by
the
medical
authorities
to
provide
nurses
for
the
sick
at
camp
about
a
mile
from
kingston
and
leaving
some
nurses
and
my
sister
at
home
i
went
there
and
did
my
best
but
it
was
little
we
could
do
to
mitigate
the
severity
of
the
epidemic
about
eight
months
after
my
return
to
jamaica
it
became
necessary
that
some
one
should
go
to
the
isthmus
of
panama
to
wind
up
the
affairs
of
my
late
hotel
and
having
another
fit
of
restlessness
i
prepared
to
return
there
myself
i
found
navy
bay
but
little
altered
it
was
evening
when
i
arrived
there
and
my
friend
h
who
came
to
meet
me
on
the
wharf
carefully
piloted
me
through
the
wretched
streets
giving
me
especial
warning
not
to
stumble
over
what
looked
like
three
long
boxes
loosely
covered
with
the
of
a
fallen
house
they
had
such
a
peculiar
look
about
them
that
i
stopped
to
ask
what
they
were
receiving
an
answer
which
revived
all
my
former
memories
of
darien
life
oh
they
only
three
irishmen
killed
in
a
row
a
week
ago
whom
it
nobody
business
to
bury
i
went
to
gorgona
wound
up
the
affairs
of
the
hotel
and
before
returning
to
navy
bay
took
the
occasion
of
accompanying
my
brother
to
the
town
of
panama
we
did
not
go
with
the
crowd
but
rode
alone
on
mules
taking
with
us
three
native
guides
on
foot
and
although
the
distance
was
not
much
over
twenty
miles
and
we
started
at
daybreak
we
did
not
reach
panama
until
nightfall
but
far
from
being
surprised
at
this
my
chief
wonder
was
that
we
ever
succeeded
in
getting
over
the
journey
through
sand
and
mud
over
hill
and
plain
through
thick
forests
deep
gulleys
and
over
rapid
streams
ran
the
track
the
road
sometimes
being
made
of
logs
of
wood
laid
transversely
with
faggots
stuffed
between
while
here
and
there
we
had
to
work
our
way
through
a
tangled
network
of
brushwood
and
over
broken
rocks
that
seemed
to
have
been
piled
together
as
stones
for
some
giant
sling
we
found
panama
an
irregular
town
with
queer
stone
houses
almost
all
of
which
had
been
turned
by
the
traders
into
stores
on
my
return
to
navy
bay
or
colon
as
the
new
granadans
would
have
it
called
i
again
opened
a
store
and
stayed
there
for
three
months
or
so
i
did
not
find
that
society
had
improved
much
in
my
absence
indeed
it
appeared
to
have
grown
more
lawless
endless
quarrels
often
resulting
in
bloodshed
took
place
between
the
strangers
and
the
natives
and
disturbed
the
peace
of
the
town
once
the
spanish
were
incensed
to
such
an
extent
that
they
planned
a
general
rising
against
the
foreigners
and
but
for
the
opportune
arrival
of
an
english
the
consequences
might
have
been
terrible
the
americans
were
well
armed
and
ready
but
the
native
population
far
outnumbered
them
altogether
i
was
not
sorry
when
an
opportunity
offered
itself
to
do
something
at
one
of
the
stations
of
the
new
granada
company
escribanos
about
seventy
miles
from
navy
bay
i
made
the
journey
there
in
a
little
vessel
all
communication
by
land
from
navy
bay
being
impossible
on
account
of
the
thick
dense
forests
that
would
have
resisted
the
attempts
of
an
army
to
cut
its
way
through
them
as
i
was
at
this
place
for
some
months
altogether
and
as
it
was
the
only
portion
of
my
life
devoted
to
i
shall
make
no
apologies
for
endeavouring
to
describe
the
of
new
granada
escribanos
is
in
the
province
of
veraguas
in
the
state
of
new
granada
information
uninteresting
enough
i
have
little
doubt
to
all
but
a
very
few
of
my
readers
it
lies
near
the
mouth
of
a
rivulet
bearing
that
name
which
leaving
the
river
belen
runs
away
to
the
sea
on
its
own
account
about
a
mile
from
the
mouth
of
that
river
it
is
a
great
neighbourhood
for
and
about
that
time
companies
and
private
individuals
were
trying
hard
to
turn
them
to
good
account
near
it
is
the
fort
bowen
mine
and
several
others
some
yielding
silver
others
gold
ore
in
small
quantities
others
lie
in
the
vicinity
of
the
palmilla
another
river
which
discharges
itself
into
the
sea
about
ten
miles
from
escribanos
and
there
were
more
eastward
of
it
near
a
similar
river
the
coquelet
legends
were
rife
at
that
time
and
they
may
be
revived
at
no
distant
date
of
the
treasures
to
be
found
at
cucuyo
zapetero
pananomé
and
many
other
indian
villages
on
their
banks
which
in
times
gone
by
had
yielded
up
golden
treasures
to
the
old
world
but
at
this
time
the
yield
of
gold
did
not
repay
the
labour
and
capital
necessary
to
extract
it
from
the
quartz
and
it
can
only
prove
successful
if
more
economical
methods
can
be
discovered
than
those
now
used
for
that
purpose
carlos
alexander
the
alcalde
of
escribanos
had
made
a
good
thing
out
of
the
gold
mania
the
mine
had
belonged
to
him
had
been
sold
at
a
fine
price
and
passing
through
several
hands
had
at
last
come
into
possession
of
the
company
who
were
now
working
it
its
former
owner
settling
down
as
ruler
over
the
little
community
of
two
hundred
souls
that
had
collected
at
escribanos
he
was
a
black
man
was
fond
of
talking
of
his
early
life
in
slavery
and
how
he
had
escaped
and
possessed
no
ordinary
intellect
he
possessed
also
a
house
which
in
england
a
hound
would
not
have
accepted
as
a
kennel
a
white
wife
and
a
pretty
daughter
with
a
complexion
and
a
pleasant
name
juliana
of
this
mine
day
by
whose
invitation
when
i
saw
him
at
navy
bay
i
went
there
was
at
that
time
superintendent
he
was
a
distant
connection
of
my
late
husband
and
treated
me
with
great
kindness
strangely
enough
we
met
again
in
a
far
different
part
of
the
world
and
became
more
closely
connected
but
i
am
anticipating
the
major
part
of
the
population
of
escribanos
including
even
the
women
and
children
worked
at
the
mine
the
labour
was
hard
and
disagreeable
i
often
used
to
watch
them
at
their
work
and
would
sometimes
wander
about
by
myself
thinking
it
possible
that
i
might
tumble
across
some
gold
in
my
rambles
and
i
once
did
come
upon
some
heavy
yellow
material
that
brought
my
heart
into
my
mouth
with
that
strange
thrilling
delight
which
all
who
have
hunted
for
the
precious
metal
understand
so
well
i
think
it
was
very
wrong
but
i
kept
the
secret
of
the
place
from
the
alcalde
and
every
one
else
and
filled
some
bottles
with
the
precious
dust
to
carry
down
to
navy
bay
i
did
not
go
for
some
time
but
when
i
did
one
of
my
first
visits
was
to
a
and
you
can
imagine
my
feelings
when
he
coolly
laughed
and
told
me
it
was
some
material
i
forget
its
name
very
like
gold
but
valueless
the
worst
part
of
it
was
that
in
my
annoyance
and
shame
i
threw
all
i
had
away
and
among
it
some
which
i
had
reason
to
believe
subsequently
was
genuine
the
landing
at
escribanos
was
very
difficult
and
when
the
surf
ran
high
impossible
and
i
was
once
witness
to
a
harrowing
scene
there
a
little
boat
manned
by
three
sailors
grounded
on
a
rock
not
far
from
shore
at
a
terrible
season
when
to
reach
it
from
the
land
was
after
many
attempts
found
impossible
the
hapless
crew
lingered
on
for
two
days
suffering
cruelly
from
hunger
and
thirst
their
cries
ringing
in
our
ears
above
the
storm
pitiless
fury
on
the
third
day
two
of
them
took
to
the
sea
and
were
drowned
the
third
was
not
strong
enough
to
leave
the
boat
and
died
in
it
i
did
not
stay
long
at
escribanos
on
my
first
visit
as
the
guest
but
having
made
arrangements
for
a
longer
sojourn
i
went
back
to
navy
bay
where
i
laid
in
a
good
stock
of
the
stores
i
should
have
most
use
for
and
returned
to
escribanos
in
safety
i
remained
there
some
months
pleased
with
the
novelty
of
the
life
and
busy
with
schemes
for
seeking
for
or
as
the
call
it
prospecting
for
other
mines
the
foreigners
were
just
as
troublesome
in
this
little
place
as
they
were
and
are
in
every
other
part
of
central
america
and
quarrels
were
as
frequent
in
our
little
community
as
at
cruces
or
navy
bay
indeed
alexander
had
hard
work
to
maintain
peace
in
his
small
kingdom
and
although
ably
seconded
by
day
more
than
once
american
disregard
of
his
sway
was
almost
too
strong
for
him
very
often
the
few
foreigners
would
quarrel
among
themselves
and
once
when
they
came
to
blows
and
an
irishman
was
stabbed
by
an
american
named
campfield
the
alcalde
roused
himself
to
punish
the
culprit
the
native
population
were
glad
enough
to
have
an
american
in
their
power
and
when
i
heard
alexander
give
his
men
instructions
to
shoot
the
culprit
if
he
resisted
i
started
off
to
his
hut
and
reached
it
in
time
to
prevent
bloodshed
he
was
taken
and
kept
in
confinement
and
juliana
and
i
had
enough
to
do
to
prevent
his
being
made
a
stern
example
of
but
we
got
him
off
for
a
fine
of
five
hundred
dollars
again
the
little
community
of
escribanos
was
very
near
getting
up
a
revolution
against
its
constituted
government
a
very
common
amusement
in
central
america
twelve
sailors
deserters
from
an
american
ship
found
their
way
there
and
before
long
plotted
to
dethrone
alexander
and
take
possession
of
the
mine
day
gained
information
of
their
plan
the
whole
population
of
escribanos
were
roused
and
warned
and
arming
a
score
of
the
boldest
natives
he
surrounded
the
house
in
which
they
were
and
captured
the
conspirators
who
were
too
much
taken
by
surprise
to
offer
resistance
and
sent
them
down
to
navy
bay
there
to
be
handed
over
to
the
government
whose
service
they
had
left
of
course
my
medical
skill
did
not
rust
for
want
of
practice
at
escribanos
the
place
was
not
healthy
and
strangers
to
the
climate
suffered
severely
a
surgeon
himself
sent
there
by
the
west
granada
company
was
glad
to
throw
physic
to
the
dogs
and
be
cured
in
my
way
by
mine
while
i
was
fortunately
able
to
nurse
day
through
a
sharp
attack
of
illness
in
consequence
of
the
difficulty
of
communication
with
navy
bay
our
fare
was
of
the
simplest
at
escribanos
it
consisted
mainly
of
salt
meat
rice
and
roasted
indian
corn
the
native
fare
was
not
tempting
and
some
of
their
delicacies
were
absolutely
disgusting
with
what
pleasure
for
instance
could
one
foreign
to
their
tastes
and
habits
dine
off
a
roasted
monkey
whose
grilled
head
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
a
negro
baby
and
yet
the
indians
used
to
bring
them
to
us
for
sale
strung
on
a
stick
they
were
worse
still
stewed
in
soup
when
it
was
positively
frightful
to
dip
your
ladle
in
unsuspectingly
and
bring
up
what
closely
resembled
a
brown
limb
i
got
on
better
with
the
parrots
and
could
agree
with
the
senorita
buono
buono
with
which
the
natives
recommended
them
and
yet
their
flesh
what
little
there
was
of
it
was
very
coarse
and
hard
nor
did
i
always
refuse
to
concede
praise
to
a
squirrel
if
well
cooked
but
although
the
flesh
of
the
iguana
another
favourite
dish
was
white
and
tender
as
any
chicken
i
never
could
stomach
it
these
iguanas
are
immense
green
lizards
or
rather
crocodiles
sometimes
three
feet
in
length
but
weighing
generally
about
seven
or
eight
pounds
the
indians
used
to
bring
them
down
in
boats
alive
on
their
backs
with
their
legs
tied
behind
them
so
that
they
had
the
most
comical
look
of
distress
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
spanish
indians
have
a
proverb
referring
to
an
iguana
so
bound
the
purport
of
which
has
slipped
from
my
memory
but
which
shows
the
habit
to
be
an
old
one
their
eggs
are
highly
prized
and
their
captors
have
a
cruel
habit
of
extracting
these
delicacies
from
them
while
alive
and
roughly
sewing
up
the
wound
which
i
never
could
muster
sufficient
courage
to
witness
the
rivers
near
escribanos
were
well
stocked
with
crocodiles
the
sea
had
its
fair
share
of
sharks
while
on
land
you
too
often
met
with
snakes
and
other
venomous
reptiles
the
sting
of
some
of
them
was
very
dangerous
one
man
who
was
bitten
when
i
was
there
swelled
to
an
enormous
size
and
bled
even
at
the
roots
of
his
hair
the
remedy
of
the
natives
appeared
to
be
copious
bleeding
before
i
left
escribanos
i
made
a
journey
in
company
with
a
gentleman
named
little
my
maid
and
the
alcalde
daughter
into
the
interior
of
the
country
for
a
short
distance
following
the
course
of
the
palmilla
river
this
was
for
the
purpose
of
prospecting
a
mine
on
that
river
said
to
be
obtainable
at
an
easy
price
its
course
was
a
very
winding
one
and
we
often
had
to
leave
the
canoe
and
walk
through
the
shallow
waters
that
every
now
and
then
interfered
with
our
progress
as
we
progressed
little
carefully
sounded
the
channel
of
the
river
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
to
what
extent
it
was
navigable
the
tropical
scenery
was
very
grand
but
i
am
afraid
i
only
marked
what
was
most
curious
in
it
at
least
that
is
foremost
in
my
memory
now
i
know
i
wondered
much
what
motive
nature
could
have
had
in
twisting
the
roots
and
branches
of
the
trees
into
such
strange
fantastic
contortions
i
watched
with
unfailing
interest
the
birds
and
animals
we
disturbed
in
our
progress
from
the
huge
peccary
or
wild
boar
that
went
tearing
through
the
brushwood
to
the
tiniest
bird
that
dashed
like
a
flash
of
fire
before
our
eyes
and
very
much
surprised
was
i
when
the
indians
stopped
before
a
large
tree
and
on
their
making
an
incision
in
the
bark
with
a
matcheto
hatchet
there
exuded
a
thick
creamy
liquid
which
they
wished
me
to
taste
saying
that
this
was
the
famous
i
needed
some
persuasion
at
first
but
when
i
had
tasted
some
upon
a
biscuit
i
was
so
charmed
with
its
flavour
that
i
should
soon
have
taken
more
than
was
good
for
me
had
not
little
interfered
with
some
judicious
advice
we
reached
the
mine
and
brought
back
specimens
of
the
quartz
some
of
which
i
have
now
soon
after
this
i
left
escribanos
and
stopping
but
a
short
time
at
navy
bay
came
on
direct
to
england
i
had
claims
on
a
mining
company
which
are
still
unsatisfied
i
had
to
look
after
my
share
in
the
palmilla
mine
speculation
and
above
all
i
had
long
been
troubled
with
a
secret
desire
to
embark
in
a
very
novel
speculation
about
which
i
have
as
yet
said
nothing
to
the
reader
but
before
i
finally
leave
the
republic
of
new
granada
i
may
be
allowed
to
write
a
few
words
on
the
present
aspect
of
affairs
on
the
isthmus
of
panama
recent
news
from
america
bring
the
intelligence
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
at
length
succeeded
in
finding
a
reasonable
excuse
for
exercising
a
protectorate
over
or
in
other
words
annexing
the
isthmus
of
panama
to
any
one
at
all
acquainted
with
american
policy
in
central
america
this
intelligence
can
give
no
surprise
our
only
wonder
being
that
some
such
excuse
was
not
made
years
ago
at
this
crisis
then
a
few
remarks
from
the
humblest
observer
of
life
in
the
republic
of
new
granada
must
possess
some
interest
for
the
curious
if
not
value
i
found
something
to
admire
in
the
people
of
new
granada
but
not
much
and
i
found
very
much
more
to
condemn
most
unequivocally
whatever
was
of
any
worth
in
their
institutions
such
as
their
comparative
freedom
religious
toleration
was
owing
mainly
to
the
negroes
who
had
sought
the
protection
of
the
republic
i
found
the
spanish
indians
treacherous
passionate
and
indolent
with
no
higher
aim
or
object
but
simply
to
enjoy
the
present
after
their
own
torpid
useless
fashion
like
most
fallen
nations
they
are
very
conservative
in
their
habits
and
principles
while
the
blacks
are
enterprising
and
in
their
opinions
incline
not
unnaturally
to
democracy
but
for
their
old
antipathy
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
negroes
would
lean
towards
america
but
they
gladly
encourage
the
prejudice
of
the
new
granadans
and
foster
it
in
every
way
hence
the
ceaseless
quarrels
which
have
disturbed
chagres
and
panama
until
it
has
become
necessary
for
an
american
force
to
garrison
those
towns
for
humanity
and
civilization
sake
there
can
be
little
doubt
as
to
the
expediency
of
this
step
but
i
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
to
hear
that
the
republic
was
preparing
to
make
some
show
of
resistance
against
its
powerful
brother
for
as
the
reader
will
have
perceived
the
new
granadans
experiences
of
american
manners
have
not
been
favourable
and
they
do
not
know
as
we
do
how
little
real
sympathy
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
with
the
extreme
class
of
its
citizens
who
have
made
themselves
so
conspicuous
in
the
great
to
california
chapter
viii
i
long
to
join
the
british
army
before
sebastopol
my
wanderings
about
london
for
that
purpose
how
i
fail
establishment
of
the
firm
of
day
and
martin
i
embark
for
turkey
before
i
left
jamaica
for
navy
bay
as
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
war
had
been
declared
against
russia
and
we
were
all
anxiously
expecting
news
of
a
descent
upon
the
crimea
now
no
sooner
had
i
heard
of
war
somewhere
than
i
longed
to
witness
it
and
when
i
was
told
that
many
of
the
regiments
i
had
known
so
well
in
jamaica
had
left
england
for
the
scene
of
action
the
desire
to
join
them
became
stronger
than
ever
i
used
to
stand
for
hours
in
silent
thought
before
an
old
map
of
the
world
in
a
little
corner
of
which
some
one
had
chalked
a
red
cross
to
enable
me
to
distinguish
where
the
crimea
was
and
as
i
traced
the
route
thither
all
difficulties
would
vanish
but
when
i
came
to
talk
over
the
project
with
my
friends
the
best
scheme
i
could
devise
seemed
so
wild
and
improbable
that
i
was
fain
to
resign
my
hopes
for
a
time
and
so
started
for
navy
bay
but
all
the
way
to
england
from
navy
bay
i
was
turning
my
old
wish
over
and
over
in
my
mind
and
when
i
found
myself
in
london
in
the
autumn
of
just
after
the
battle
of
alma
had
been
fought
and
my
old
friends
were
fairly
before
the
walls
of
sebastopol
how
to
join
them
there
took
up
far
more
of
my
thoughts
than
that
visionary
speculation
on
the
river
palmilla
which
seemed
so
feasible
to
us
in
new
granada
but
was
considered
so
wild
and
unprofitable
a
speculation
in
london
and
as
time
wore
on
the
inclination
to
join
my
old
friends
of
the
and
other
regiments
battling
with
worse
foes
than
yellow
fever
or
cholera
took
such
exclusive
possession
of
my
mind
that
i
threw
over
the
gold
speculation
altogether
and
devoted
all
my
energies
to
my
new
scheme
heaven
knows
it
was
visionary
enough
i
had
no
friends
who
could
help
me
in
such
a
project
nay
who
would
understand
why
i
desired
to
go
and
what
i
desired
to
do
when
i
got
there
my
funds
although
they
might
carefully
husbanded
carry
me
over
the
three
thousand
miles
and
land
me
at
balaclava
would
not
support
me
there
long
while
to
persuade
the
public
that
an
unknown
creole
woman
would
be
useful
to
their
army
before
sebastopol
was
too
improbable
an
achievement
to
be
thought
of
for
an
instant
circumstances
however
assisted
me
as
the
winter
wore
on
came
hints
from
various
quarters
of
mismanagement
want
and
suffering
in
the
crimea
and
after
the
battles
of
balaclava
and
inkermann
and
the
fearful
storm
of
the
of
november
the
worst
anticipations
were
realized
then
we
knew
that
the
hospitals
were
full
to
suffocation
that
scarcity
and
exposure
were
the
fate
of
all
in
the
camp
and
that
the
brave
fellows
for
whom
any
of
us
at
home
would
have
split
our
last
shilling
and
shared
our
last
meal
were
dying
thousands
of
miles
away
from
the
active
sympathy
of
their
fast
and
thick
upon
the
news
of
inkermann
fought
by
a
handful
of
fasting
and
enfeebled
men
against
eight
times
their
number
of
picked
russians
brought
fresh
and
animated
to
the
contest
and
while
all
england
was
reeling
beneath
the
shock
of
that
fearful
victory
came
the
sad
news
that
hundreds
were
dying
whom
the
russian
shot
and
sword
had
spared
and
that
the
hospitals
of
scutari
were
utterly
unable
to
shelter
or
their
inadequate
staff
to
attend
to
the
of
sick
and
wounded
which
were
sent
to
them
across
the
stormy
black
sea
but
directly
england
knew
the
worst
she
set
about
repairing
her
past
neglect
in
every
household
busy
fingers
were
working
for
the
poor
soldier
money
flowed
in
golden
streams
wherever
need
was
and
christian
ladies
mindful
of
the
sublime
example
i
was
sick
and
ye
visited
me
hastened
to
volunteer
their
services
by
those
which
only
women
know
how
to
soothe
and
bless
need
i
be
ashamed
to
confess
that
i
shared
in
the
general
enthusiasm
and
longed
more
than
ever
to
carry
my
busy
and
the
reader
will
not
hesitate
to
add
experienced
fingers
where
the
sword
or
bullet
had
been
busiest
and
pestilence
most
rife
i
had
seen
much
of
sorrow
and
death
elsewhere
but
they
had
never
daunted
me
and
if
i
could
feel
happy
binding
up
the
wounds
of
quarrelsome
americans
and
treacherous
spaniards
what
delight
should
i
not
experience
if
i
could
be
useful
to
my
own
sons
suffering
for
a
cause
it
was
so
glorious
to
fight
and
bleed
for
i
never
stayed
to
discuss
probabilities
or
enter
into
conjectures
as
to
my
chances
of
reaching
the
scene
of
action
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
the
army
wanted
nurses
they
would
be
glad
of
me
and
with
all
the
ardour
of
my
nature
which
ever
carried
me
where
inclination
prompted
i
decided
that
i
go
to
the
crimea
and
go
i
did
as
all
the
world
knows
of
course
had
it
not
been
for
my
old
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
obstinacy
and
is
in
no
way
related
to
it
the
best
term
i
can
think
of
to
express
it
being
judicious
decisiveness
i
should
have
given
up
the
scheme
a
score
of
times
in
as
many
days
so
regularly
did
each
successive
day
give
birth
to
a
fresh
set
of
rebuffs
and
disappointments
i
shall
make
no
excuse
to
my
readers
for
giving
them
a
pretty
full
history
of
my
struggles
to
become
a
crimean
my
first
idea
and
knowing
that
i
was
well
fitted
for
the
work
and
would
be
the
right
woman
in
the
right
place
the
reader
can
fancy
my
audacity
was
to
apply
to
the
war
office
for
the
post
of
hospital
nurse
among
the
diseases
which
i
understood
were
most
prevalent
in
the
crimea
were
cholera
diarrhoea
and
dysentery
all
of
them
more
or
less
known
in
tropical
climates
and
with
which
as
the
reader
will
remember
my
panama
experience
had
made
me
tolerably
familiar
now
no
one
will
accuse
me
of
presumption
if
i
say
that
i
thought
and
so
it
afterwards
proved
that
my
knowledge
of
these
human
ills
would
not
only
render
my
services
as
a
nurse
more
valuable
but
would
enable
me
to
be
of
use
to
the
overworked
doctors
that
others
thought
so
too
i
took
with
me
ample
testimony
i
can
not
resist
the
temptation
of
giving
my
readers
one
of
the
testimonials
i
had
it
seems
so
eminently
practical
and
to
the
point
i
became
acquainted
with
seacole
through
the
instrumentality
of
cowan
consul
at
colon
on
the
isthmus
of
panama
and
have
had
many
opportunities
of
witnessing
her
professional
zeal
and
ability
in
the
treatment
of
aggravated
forms
of
tropical
diseases
i
am
myself
personally
much
indebted
for
her
indefatigable
kindness
and
skill
at
a
time
when
i
am
apt
to
believe
the
advice
of
a
practitioner
qualified
in
the
north
would
have
little
availed
her
peculiar
fitness
in
a
constitutional
point
of
view
for
the
duties
of
a
medical
attendant
needs
no
comment
signed
late
medical
officer
west
granada
company
so
i
made
long
and
unwearied
application
at
the
war
office
in
blissful
ignorance
of
the
labour
and
time
i
was
throwing
away
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
i
considerably
interfered
with
the
repose
of
sundry
messengers
and
disturbed
to
an
alarming
degree
the
official
gravity
of
some
nice
gentlemanly
young
fellows
who
were
working
out
their
salaries
in
an
easy
way
but
my
ridiculous
endeavours
to
gain
an
interview
with
the
of
course
failed
and
glad
at
last
to
oblige
a
distracted
messenger
i
transferred
my
attentions
to
the
department
here
i
saw
another
gentleman
who
listened
to
me
with
a
great
deal
of
polite
enjoyment
and
his
amusement
ended
hinted
had
i
not
better
apply
to
the
medical
department
and
accordingly
i
attached
myself
to
their
quarters
with
the
same
unwearying
ardour
but
of
course
i
grew
tired
at
last
and
then
i
changed
my
plans
now
i
am
not
for
a
single
instant
going
to
blame
the
authorities
who
would
not
listen
to
the
offer
of
a
motherly
yellow
woman
to
go
to
the
crimea
and
nurse
her
sons
there
suffering
from
cholera
diarrhoea
and
a
host
of
lesser
ills
in
my
country
where
people
know
our
use
it
would
have
been
different
but
here
it
was
natural
enough
although
i
had
references
and
other
voices
spoke
for
me
that
they
should
laugh
enough
at
my
offer
war
i
know
is
a
serious
game
but
sometimes
very
humble
actors
are
of
great
use
in
it
and
if
the
reader
when
he
comes
in
time
to
peruse
the
evidence
of
those
who
had
to
do
with
the
sebastopol
drama
of
my
share
in
it
will
turn
back
to
this
chapter
he
will
confess
perhaps
that
after
all
the
impulse
which
led
me
to
the
war
department
was
not
unnatural
my
new
scheme
was
i
candidly
confess
worse
devised
than
the
one
which
had
failed
miss
nightingale
had
left
england
for
the
crimea
but
other
nurses
were
still
to
follow
and
my
new
plan
was
simply
to
offer
myself
to
h
as
a
recruit
feeling
that
i
was
one
of
the
very
women
they
most
wanted
experienced
and
fond
of
the
work
i
jumped
at
once
to
the
conclusion
that
they
would
gladly
enrol
me
in
their
number
to
go
to
cox
the
army
agents
who
were
most
obliging
to
me
and
obtain
the
private
address
did
not
take
long
and
that
done
i
laid
the
same
pertinacious
siege
to
his
great
house
in
square
as
i
had
previously
done
to
his
place
of
business
many
a
long
hour
did
i
wait
in
his
great
hall
while
scores
passed
in
and
out
many
of
them
looking
curiously
at
me
the
flunkeys
noble
creatures
marvelled
exceedingly
at
the
yellow
woman
whom
no
excuses
could
get
rid
of
nor
impertinence
dismay
and
showed
me
very
clearly
that
they
resented
my
persisting
in
remaining
there
in
mute
appeal
from
their
sovereign
will
at
last
i
gave
that
up
after
a
message
from
that
the
full
complement
of
nurses
had
been
secured
and
that
my
offer
could
not
be
entertained
once
again
i
tried
and
had
an
interview
this
time
with
one
of
miss
nightingale
companions
she
gave
me
the
same
reply
and
i
read
in
her
face
the
fact
that
had
there
been
a
vacancy
i
should
not
have
been
chosen
to
fill
it
as
a
last
resort
i
applied
to
the
managers
of
the
crimean
fund
to
know
whether
they
would
give
me
a
passage
to
the
camp
once
there
i
would
trust
to
something
turning
up
but
this
failed
also
and
one
cold
evening
i
stood
in
the
twilight
which
was
fast
deepening
into
wintry
night
and
looked
back
upon
the
ruins
of
my
last
castle
in
the
air
the
disappointment
seemed
a
cruel
one
i
was
so
conscious
of
the
unselfishness
of
the
motives
which
induced
me
to
leave
england
so
certain
of
the
service
i
could
render
among
the
sick
soldiery
and
yet
i
found
it
so
difficult
to
convince
others
of
these
facts
doubts
and
suspicions
arose
in
my
heart
for
the
first
and
last
time
thank
heaven
was
it
possible
that
american
prejudices
against
colour
had
some
root
here
did
these
ladies
shrink
from
accepting
my
aid
because
my
blood
flowed
beneath
a
somewhat
duskier
skin
than
theirs
tears
streamed
down
my
foolish
cheeks
as
i
stood
in
the
fast
thinning
streets
tears
of
grief
that
any
should
doubt
my
motives
that
heaven
should
deny
me
the
opportunity
that
i
sought
then
i
stood
still
and
looking
upward
through
and
through
the
dark
clouds
that
shadowed
london
prayed
aloud
for
help
i
dare
say
that
i
was
a
strange
sight
to
the
few
who
hastened
homeward
through
the
gloom
and
mist
of
that
wintry
night
i
dare
say
those
who
read
these
pages
will
wonder
at
me
as
much
as
they
who
saw
me
did
but
you
must
all
remember
that
i
am
one
of
an
impulsive
people
and
find
it
hard
to
put
that
restraint
upon
my
feelings
which
to
you
is
so
easy
and
natural
the
morrow
however
brought
fresh
hope
a
good
night
rest
had
served
to
strengthen
my
determination
let
what
might
happen
to
the
crimea
i
would
go
if
in
no
other
way
then
would
i
upon
my
own
responsibility
and
at
my
own
cost
there
were
those
there
who
had
known
me
in
jamaica
who
had
been
under
my
care
doctors
who
would
vouch
for
my
skill
and
willingness
to
aid
them
and
a
general
who
had
more
than
once
helped
me
and
would
do
so
still
why
not
trust
to
their
welcome
and
kindness
and
start
at
once
if
the
authorities
had
allowed
me
i
would
willingly
have
given
them
my
services
as
a
nurse
but
as
they
declined
them
should
i
not
open
an
hotel
for
invalids
in
the
crimea
in
my
own
way
i
had
no
more
idea
of
what
the
crimea
was
than
the
home
authorities
themselves
perhaps
but
having
once
made
up
my
mind
it
was
not
long
before
cards
were
printed
and
speeding
across
the
mediterranean
to
my
friends
before
sebastopol
here
is
one
of
them
british
hotel
mary
seacole
of
kingston
respectfully
announces
to
her
former
kind
friends
and
to
the
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
generally
that
she
has
taken
her
passage
in
the
hollander
to
start
from
london
on
the
of
january
intending
on
her
arrival
at
balaclava
to
establish
a
mess
table
and
comfortable
quarters
for
sick
and
convalescent
officers
this
bold
programme
would
reach
the
crimea
in
the
end
of
january
at
a
time
when
any
officer
would
have
considered
a
stall
in
an
english
stable
luxurious
quarters
compared
to
those
he
possessed
and
had
nearly
forgotten
the
comforts
of
a
it
must
have
read
to
them
rather
like
a
mockery
and
yet
as
the
reader
will
see
i
succeeded
in
redeeming
my
pledge
while
this
new
scheme
was
maturing
i
again
met
day
in
england
he
was
bound
to
balaclava
upon
some
shipping
business
and
we
came
to
the
understanding
that
if
it
were
found
desirable
we
should
together
open
a
store
as
well
as
an
hotel
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
camp
so
was
originated
the
firm
of
seacole
and
day
i
am
sorry
to
say
the
camp
wits
dubbed
it
day
and
martin
which
for
so
many
months
did
business
upon
the
now
deserted
from
the
then
busy
harbour
of
balaclava
to
the
front
of
the
british
army
before
sebastopol
these
new
arrangements
were
not
allowed
to
interfere
in
any
way
with
the
main
object
of
my
journey
a
great
portion
of
my
limited
capital
was
with
the
kind
aid
of
a
medical
friend
invested
in
medicines
which
i
had
reason
to
believe
would
be
useful
with
the
remainder
i
purchased
those
home
comforts
which
i
thought
would
be
most
difficult
to
obtain
away
from
england
i
had
scarcely
set
my
foot
on
board
the
hollander
before
i
met
a
friend
the
supercargo
was
the
brother
of
the
s
whose
death
in
jamaica
the
reader
will
not
have
forgotten
and
he
gave
me
a
hearty
welcome
i
thought
the
meeting
augured
well
and
when
i
told
him
my
plans
he
gave
me
the
most
cheering
encouragement
i
was
glad
indeed
of
any
support
for
beyond
all
doubt
my
project
was
a
hazardous
one
so
cheered
at
the
outset
i
watched
without
a
pang
the
shores
of
england
sink
behind
the
smooth
sea
and
turned
my
gaze
hopefully
to
the
as
yet
landless
horizon
beyond
which
lay
that
little
peninsula
to
which
the
eyes
and
hearts
of
all
england
were
so
earnestly
directed
so
cheerily
the
good
ship
ploughed
its
way
eastward
ho
for
turkey
chapter
ix
voyage
to
constantinople
malta
gibraltar
constantinople
and
what
i
thought
of
it
visit
to
scutari
hospital
miss
nightingale
i
am
not
going
to
risk
the
danger
of
wearying
the
reader
with
a
long
account
of
the
voyage
to
constantinople
already
worn
threadbare
by
tourists
it
was
a
very
interesting
one
and
as
i
am
a
good
sailor
i
had
not
even
the
temporary
horrors
of
to
mar
it
the
weather
although
cold
was
fine
and
the
sea
calm
and
i
enjoyed
the
voyage
amazingly
and
as
day
by
day
we
drew
nearer
to
the
scene
of
action
my
doubts
of
success
grew
less
and
less
until
i
had
a
conviction
of
the
rightness
of
the
step
i
had
taken
which
would
have
carried
me
buoyantly
through
any
difficulties
on
the
way
of
course
i
was
called
up
from
my
berth
at
an
unreasonable
hour
to
gaze
upon
the
cape
of
vincent
and
expected
to
feel
duly
impressed
when
the
long
bay
where
trafalgar
fight
was
won
came
in
view
with
the
white
convent
walls
on
the
cliffs
above
bathed
in
the
early
sunlight
i
never
failed
to
take
an
almost
childish
interest
in
the
signals
which
passed
between
the
hollander
and
the
fleet
of
vessels
whose
sails
whitened
the
track
to
and
from
the
crimea
trying
to
puzzle
out
the
language
these
children
of
the
ocean
spoke
in
their
hurried
course
and
wondering
whether
any
or
what
sufficiently
important
thing
happen
which
would
warrant
their
stopping
on
their
busy
way
we
spent
a
short
time
at
gibraltar
and
you
may
imagine
that
i
was
soon
on
shore
making
the
best
use
of
the
few
hours
reprieve
granted
to
the
hollander
weary
engines
i
had
an
idea
that
i
should
do
better
alone
so
i
declined
all
offers
of
companionship
and
selecting
a
brisk
young
fellow
from
the
mob
of
cicerones
who
offered
their
services
saw
more
of
the
art
of
fortification
in
an
hour
or
so
than
i
could
understand
in
as
many
years
the
pleasure
was
rather
fatiguing
and
i
was
not
sorry
to
return
to
the
where
i
stood
curiously
watching
its
strange
and
motley
population
while
so
engaged
i
heard
for
the
first
time
an
exclamation
which
became
familiar
enough
to
me
afterwards
why
bless
my
soul
old
fellow
if
this
is
not
our
good
old
mother
seacole
i
turned
round
and
saw
two
officers
whose
features
set
in
a
broad
frame
of
crimean
beard
i
had
some
difficulty
in
recognising
but
i
soon
remembered
that
they
were
two
of
the
who
had
been
often
in
my
house
at
kingston
glad
were
the
fellows
and
not
a
little
surprised
withal
to
meet
their
old
hostess
in
the
of
gibraltar
bound
for
the
scene
of
action
which
they
had
left
invalided
and
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
talking
old
times
over
some
wine
spanish
i
suppose
but
it
was
very
nasty
and
you
are
going
to
the
front
old
lady
you
of
all
people
in
the
world
why
not
my
sons
wo
they
be
glad
to
have
me
there
by
jove
yes
mother
answered
one
an
irishman
it
is
many
women
god
bless
them
we
had
to
spoil
us
out
there
but
it
not
the
place
even
for
you
who
know
what
hardship
is
you
never
get
a
roof
to
cover
you
at
balaclava
nor
on
the
road
either
so
they
rattled
on
telling
me
of
the
difficulties
that
were
in
store
for
me
but
they
could
not
shake
my
resolution
do
you
think
i
shall
be
of
any
use
to
you
when
i
get
there
surely
then
i
go
were
the
place
a
hundred
times
worse
than
you
describe
it
ca
i
rig
up
a
hut
with
the
and
sleep
if
need
be
on
straw
like
margery
daw
so
they
laughed
and
drank
success
to
me
and
to
our
next
meeting
for
although
they
were
going
home
invalided
the
brave
hearts
were
with
their
companions
for
all
the
hardships
they
had
passed
through
we
stopped
at
malta
also
where
of
course
i
landed
and
stared
about
me
and
submitted
to
be
robbed
by
the
lazy
maltese
with
all
a
traveller
resignation
here
also
i
met
friends
some
medical
officers
who
had
known
me
in
kingston
and
one
of
them
f
lately
arrived
from
scutari
gave
me
when
he
heard
my
plans
a
letter
of
introduction
to
miss
nightingale
then
hard
at
work
evoking
order
out
of
confusion
and
bravely
resisting
the
despotism
of
death
at
the
hospital
of
scutari
so
on
past
beautiful
islands
and
shores
until
we
are
steaming
against
a
swift
current
and
an
adverse
wind
between
two
promontories
of
rock
which
they
tell
me
stand
in
europe
and
in
asia
and
are
connected
with
some
pretty
tale
of
love
in
days
long
gone
by
ah
travel
where
a
woman
may
in
the
new
world
or
the
old
she
meets
this
old
old
tale
everywhere
it
is
the
one
bond
of
sympathy
which
i
have
found
existing
in
three
quarters
of
the
world
alike
so
on
until
the
cable
rattles
over
the
windlass
as
the
good
ship
anchor
plunges
down
fathoms
deep
into
the
blue
waters
of
the
bosphorus
her
voyage
ended
i
do
not
think
that
constantinople
impressed
me
so
much
as
i
had
expected
and
i
thought
its
streets
would
match
those
of
navy
bay
not
unfairly
the
caicques
also
of
which
i
had
ample
experience
for
i
spent
six
days
here
wandering
about
pera
and
stamboul
in
the
daytime
and
returning
to
the
hollander
at
nightfall
might
be
made
more
safe
and
commodious
for
stout
ladies
even
if
the
process
interfered
a
little
with
their
ornament
time
and
trouble
combined
have
left
me
with
a
portly
form
the
envy
of
many
an
angular
yankee
female
and
more
than
once
it
was
in
no
slight
danger
of
becoming
too
intimately
acquainted
with
the
temperature
of
the
bosphorus
but
i
will
do
the
turkish
boatmen
the
justice
to
say
that
they
were
as
politely
careful
of
my
safety
as
their
astonishment
and
regard
for
the
of
their
caicques
which
they
appear
to
love
as
an
arab
does
his
horse
or
an
esquimaux
his
dogs
and
for
the
same
reason
perhaps
would
admit
somewhat
surprised
also
seemed
the
greeks
who
throng
the
streets
of
pera
at
the
unprotected
creole
woman
who
took
constantinople
so
coolly
it
would
require
something
more
to
surprise
her
while
the
grave
english
raised
their
eyebrows
wonderingly
and
the
more
vivacious
french
shrugged
their
pliant
shoulders
into
the
strangest
contortions
i
accepted
it
all
as
a
compliment
to
a
stout
female
tourist
neatly
dressed
in
a
red
or
yellow
dress
a
plain
shawl
of
some
other
colour
and
a
simple
straw
with
bright
red
streamers
i
flatter
myself
that
i
woke
up
sundry
turks
who
seemed
to
think
that
the
great
object
of
life
was
to
avoid
showing
surprise
at
anything
while
the
turkish
women
gathered
around
me
and
jabbered
about
me
in
the
most
flattering
manner
how
i
ever
succeeded
in
getting
day
letters
from
the
constantinople
puzzles
me
now
but
i
did
and
i
shall
ever
regard
my
success
as
one
of
the
great
triumphs
of
my
life
their
contents
were
not
very
cheering
he
gave
a
very
dreary
account
of
balaclava
and
of
camp
life
and
almost
dissuaded
me
from
continuing
my
journey
but
his
last
letter
ended
by
giving
me
instructions
as
to
the
purchases
i
had
best
make
if
i
still
determined
upon
making
the
adventure
so
i
forgot
all
the
rest
and
busied
myself
in
laying
in
the
stores
he
recommended
but
i
found
time
before
i
left
the
hollander
to
charter
a
crazy
caicque
to
carry
me
to
scutari
intending
to
present
f
letter
to
miss
nightingale
it
was
afternoon
when
the
boatmen
set
me
down
in
safety
at
the
of
scutari
and
i
walked
up
the
slight
ascent
to
the
great
hospital
thinking
of
the
many
noble
fellows
who
had
been
borne
or
had
painfully
crept
along
this
path
only
to
die
within
that
dreary
building
i
felt
rather
dull
and
directly
i
entered
the
hospital
and
came
upon
the
long
wards
of
sufferers
lying
there
so
quiet
and
still
a
rush
of
tears
came
to
my
eyes
and
blotted
out
the
sight
for
a
few
minutes
but
i
soon
felt
at
home
and
looked
about
me
with
great
interest
the
men
were
many
of
them
very
quiet
some
of
the
convalescent
formed
themselves
into
little
groups
around
one
who
read
a
newspaper
others
had
books
in
their
hands
or
by
their
side
where
they
had
fallen
when
slumber
overtook
the
readers
while
hospital
orderlies
moved
to
and
fro
and
now
and
then
the
female
nurses
in
their
quiet
uniform
passed
noiselessly
on
some
mission
of
kindness
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
an
old
acquaintance
who
accompanied
me
through
the
wards
and
rendered
it
unnecessary
for
me
to
trouble
the
busy
nurses
this
was
an
old
man
a
sergeant
t
whom
i
had
known
in
kingston
and
who
was
slowly
recovering
from
an
attack
of
dysentery
and
making
himself
of
use
here
until
the
doctors
should
let
him
go
back
and
have
another
shy
at
the
rooshians
he
is
very
glad
to
meet
me
and
tells
me
his
history
very
socially
and
takes
me
to
the
bedsides
of
some
comrades
who
had
also
known
me
at
camp
my
poor
fellows
how
their
eyes
glisten
when
they
light
upon
an
old
friend
face
in
these
turkish
barracks
put
to
so
sad
a
use
three
thousand
miles
from
home
here
is
one
of
them
hurt
in
the
trenches
says
the
sergeant
with
shaven
bandaged
head
and
bright
restless
irish
eyes
who
hallooes
out
mother
seacole
mother
seacole
in
such
an
excited
tone
of
voice
and
when
he
has
shaken
hands
a
score
of
times
falls
back
upon
his
pillow
very
wearily
but
i
sit
by
his
side
and
try
to
cheer
him
with
talk
about
the
future
when
he
shall
grow
well
and
see
home
and
hear
them
all
thank
him
for
what
he
has
been
helping
to
do
so
that
he
grows
all
right
in
a
few
minutes
but
hearing
that
i
am
on
the
way
to
the
front
gets
excited
again
for
you
see
illness
and
weakness
make
these
strong
men
as
children
not
least
in
the
patient
unmurmuring
resignation
with
which
they
suffer
i
think
my
irish
friend
had
an
indistinct
idea
of
a
muddle
somewhere
which
had
kept
him
for
weeks
on
salt
meat
and
biscuit
until
it
gave
him
the
scurvy
for
he
is
very
anxious
that
i
should
take
over
plenty
of
vegetables
of
every
sort
and
oh
mother
and
it
is
strange
to
hear
his
almost
plaintive
tone
as
he
urges
this
take
them
plenty
of
eggs
mother
we
never
saw
eggs
over
there
at
some
slight
risk
of
giving
offence
i
can
not
resist
the
temptation
of
lending
a
helping
hand
here
and
there
replacing
a
slipped
bandage
or
easing
a
stiff
one
but
i
do
not
think
any
one
was
offended
and
one
doctor
who
had
with
some
surprise
and
at
first
alarm
on
his
face
watched
me
replace
a
bandage
which
was
giving
pain
said
very
kindly
when
i
had
finished
thank
you
one
thought
never
left
my
mind
as
i
walked
through
the
fearful
miles
of
suffering
in
that
great
hospital
if
it
is
so
here
what
must
it
not
be
at
the
scene
of
war
on
the
spot
where
the
poor
fellows
are
stricken
down
by
pestilence
or
russian
bullets
and
days
and
nights
of
agony
must
be
passed
before
a
woman
hand
can
dress
their
wounds
and
i
felt
happy
in
the
conviction
that
be
useful
three
or
four
days
nearer
to
their
pressing
wants
than
this
it
was
growing
late
before
i
felt
tired
or
thought
of
leaving
scutari
and
s
another
jamaica
friend
who
had
kindly
borne
me
company
for
the
last
agreed
with
me
that
the
caicque
was
not
the
safest
conveyance
by
night
on
the
bosphorus
and
recommended
me
to
present
my
letter
to
miss
nightingale
and
perhaps
a
lodging
for
the
night
could
be
found
for
me
so
still
under
the
patient
guidance
we
thread
our
way
through
passages
and
corridors
all
used
as
until
we
reach
the
corner
tower
of
the
building
in
which
are
the
nurses
quarters
i
think
b
who
saw
me
felt
more
surprise
than
she
could
politely
show
i
never
found
women
so
quick
to
understand
me
as
the
men
when
i
handed
her
f
kind
letter
respecting
me
and
apologized
for
troubling
miss
nightingale
there
is
that
in
the
doctor
letter
he
had
been
much
at
scutari
which
prevents
my
request
being
refused
and
i
am
asked
to
wait
until
miss
nightingale
whose
every
moment
is
valuable
can
see
me
meanwhile
questions
me
very
kindly
but
with
the
same
look
of
curiosity
and
surprise
what
object
has
seacole
in
coming
out
this
is
the
purport
of
her
questions
and
i
say
frankly
to
be
of
use
somewhere
for
other
considerations
i
had
not
until
necessity
forced
them
upon
me
willingly
had
they
accepted
me
i
would
have
worked
for
the
wounded
in
return
for
bread
and
water
i
fancy
b
thought
that
i
sought
for
employment
at
scutari
for
she
said
very
kindly
miss
nightingale
has
the
entire
management
of
our
hospital
staff
but
i
do
not
think
that
any
vacancy
excuse
me
i
interrupt
her
with
but
i
am
bound
for
the
front
in
a
few
days
and
my
questioner
leaves
me
more
surprised
than
ever
the
room
i
waited
in
was
used
as
a
kitchen
upon
the
stoves
were
cans
of
soup
broth
and
while
nurses
passed
in
and
out
with
noiseless
tread
and
subdued
manner
i
thought
many
of
them
had
that
strange
expression
of
the
eyes
which
those
who
have
gazed
long
on
scenes
of
woe
or
horror
seldom
lose
in
half
an
hour
time
i
am
admitted
to
miss
nightingale
presence
a
slight
figure
in
the
nurses
dress
with
a
pale
gentle
and
withal
firm
face
resting
lightly
in
the
palm
of
one
white
hand
while
the
other
supports
the
elbow
a
position
which
gives
to
her
countenance
a
keen
inquiring
expression
which
is
rather
marked
standing
thus
in
repose
and
yet
keenly
observant
the
greatest
sign
of
impatience
at
any
time
b
a
slight
perhaps
unwitting
motion
of
the
firmly
planted
right
foot
was
florence
nightingale
that
englishwoman
whose
name
shall
never
die
but
sound
like
music
on
the
lips
of
british
men
until
the
hour
of
doom
she
has
read
f
letter
which
lies
on
the
table
by
her
side
and
asks
in
her
gentle
but
eminently
practical
and
way
what
do
you
want
seacole
anything
that
we
can
do
for
you
if
it
lies
in
my
power
i
shall
be
very
happy
so
i
tell
her
of
my
dread
of
the
night
journey
by
caicque
and
the
improbability
of
my
finding
the
hollander
in
the
dark
and
with
some
diffidence
threw
myself
upon
the
hospitality
of
scutari
offering
to
nurse
the
sick
for
the
night
now
unfortunately
for
many
reasons
room
even
for
one
in
scutari
hospital
was
at
that
time
no
easy
matter
to
find
but
at
last
a
bed
was
discovered
to
be
unoccupied
at
the
hospital
washerwomen
quarters
my
experience
of
washerwomen
all
the
world
over
is
the
same
that
they
are
kind
folks
possibly
the
they
almost
live
in
find
their
way
into
their
hearts
and
tempers
and
soften
them
this
scutari
washerwoman
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
and
welcomes
me
most
heartily
with
her
also
are
some
invalid
nurses
and
after
they
have
gone
to
bed
we
spend
some
hours
of
the
night
talking
over
our
adventures
and
giving
one
another
scraps
of
our
respective
biographies
i
had
long
retired
to
my
couch
before
i
wished
most
heartily
that
we
had
continued
our
chat
for
unbidden
and
most
unwelcome
companions
took
the
washerwoman
place
and
persisted
not
only
in
dividing
my
bed
but
my
plump
person
also
upon
my
word
i
believe
the
fleas
are
the
only
industrious
creatures
in
all
turkey
some
of
their
relatives
would
seem
to
have
migrated
into
russia
for
i
found
them
in
the
crimea
equally
prosperous
and
ubiquitous
in
the
morning
a
breakfast
is
sent
to
my
mangled
remains
and
a
kind
message
from
b
having
reference
to
how
i
spent
the
night
and
after
an
interview
with
some
other
medical
men
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
in
jamaica
i
shake
hands
with
the
washerwoman
up
to
her
shoulders
in
already
and
start
for
the
hollander
footnote
b
subsequently
i
saw
much
of
miss
nightingale
at
balaclava
chapter
x
jew
johnny
i
start
for
balaclava
kindness
of
my
old
friends
on
board
the
medora
my
life
on
shore
the
sick
wharf
during
my
stay
in
constantinople
i
was
accustomed
to
employ
as
a
guide
a
young
greek
jew
whose
name
it
is
no
use
my
attempting
to
spell
but
whom
i
called
by
the
one
common
name
there
johnny
wishing
however
to
distinguish
my
johnny
from
the
legion
of
other
johnnies
i
prefixed
the
term
jew
to
his
other
name
and
addressed
him
as
jew
johnny
how
he
had
picked
up
his
knowledge
i
can
not
tell
but
he
could
talk
a
little
broken
english
besides
french
which
had
i
been
qualified
to
criticise
it
i
should
have
found
perhaps
as
broken
as
his
english
he
attached
himself
very
closely
to
me
and
seemed
very
anxious
to
share
my
fortunes
and
after
he
had
pleaded
hard
many
times
to
be
taken
to
the
crimea
i
gave
in
and
formally
hired
him
he
was
the
best
and
faithfullest
servant
i
had
in
the
crimea
and
so
far
from
regretting
having
picked
up
jew
johnny
from
the
streets
of
pera
i
should
have
been
very
badly
off
without
him
more
letters
come
from
day
giving
even
worse
accounts
of
the
state
of
things
at
balaclava
but
it
is
too
late
for
hesitation
now
my
plans
are
perfected
my
purchases
made
and
passage
secured
in
the
albatross
a
transport
laden
with
cattle
and
commissariat
officers
for
balaclava
i
thought
i
should
never
have
transported
my
things
from
the
hollander
to
the
albatross
it
was
a
terrible
day
and
against
the
strong
current
and
hurricane
of
wind
turkish
and
greek
arms
seemed
of
little
avail
but
at
last
after
an
hour
or
more
of
terrible
anxiety
and
fear
the
albatross
side
was
reached
and
i
clambered
on
deck
drenched
and
wretched
my
companions
are
cheerful
pleasant
fellows
and
the
short
although
somewhat
hazardous
voyage
across
the
black
sea
is
safely
made
and
one
morning
we
become
excited
at
seeing
a
dark
coast
on
which
they
tell
us
is
balaclava
as
we
steam
on
we
see
away
to
the
right
clouds
of
light
smoke
which
the
knowing
travellers
tell
us
are
not
altogether
natural
but
show
that
sebastopol
is
not
yet
taken
until
the
albatross
within
sight
of
where
the
prince
with
her
companions
went
down
in
that
fearful
november
storm
four
short
months
ago
while
application
is
made
to
the
for
leave
to
enter
the
port
of
balaclava
it
does
not
appear
the
simplest
favour
in
the
world
that
we
are
applying
for
licence
to
escape
from
the
hazards
of
the
black
sea
but
at
last
it
comes
and
we
slowly
wind
through
a
narrow
channel
and
emerge
into
a
small
landlocked
basin
so
filled
with
shipping
that
their
masts
bend
in
the
breeze
like
a
wintry
forest
whatever
might
have
been
the
case
at
one
time
there
is
order
in
balaclava
harbour
now
and
the
albatross
with
the
aid
of
her
boats
moves
along
to
her
appointed
moorings
such
a
busy
scene
as
that
small
harbour
presented
could
be
rarely
met
with
elsewhere
crowded
with
shipping
of
every
size
and
variety
from
the
noble
english
steamer
to
the
smallest
craft
while
between
them
and
the
shore
passed
and
repassed
innumerable
boats
boats
trim
and
stern
boats
laden
to
the
gunwales
greek
and
maltese
boats
carrying
their
owners
everywhere
on
their
missions
of
sharp
dealing
and
roguery
coming
from
the
quiet
gloomy
sea
into
this
little
nook
of
life
and
bustle
the
transition
is
very
sudden
and
startling
and
gives
one
enough
to
think
about
without
desiring
to
go
on
shore
this
afternoon
on
the
following
morning
day
apprised
of
my
arrival
came
on
board
the
albatross
and
our
plans
were
laid
i
must
leave
the
albatross
of
course
and
until
we
decide
upon
our
future
i
had
better
take
up
my
quarters
on
board
the
medora
which
is
hired
by
the
government
at
a
great
cost
as
an
ammunition
ship
the
proposal
was
not
a
very
agreeable
one
but
i
have
no
choice
left
me
our
stores
too
had
to
be
landed
at
once
warehouses
were
unheard
of
in
balaclava
and
we
had
to
stack
them
upon
the
shore
and
protect
them
as
well
as
we
were
able
my
first
task
directly
i
had
become
settled
on
board
the
medora
was
to
send
word
to
my
friends
of
my
arrival
in
the
crimea
and
solicit
their
aid
i
gave
a
greek
idler
one
pound
to
carry
a
letter
to
the
camp
of
the
while
i
sent
another
to
captain
peel
who
was
hard
at
work
battering
the
defences
of
sebastopol
about
the
ears
of
the
russians
from
the
batteries
of
the
royal
naval
brigade
i
addressed
others
to
many
of
the
medical
men
who
had
known
me
in
other
lands
nor
did
i
neglect
to
send
word
to
my
kind
patron
sir
john
campbell
then
commanding
a
division
and
my
old
friends
answered
my
letters
most
kindly
as
the
various
officers
came
down
on
duty
or
business
to
balaclava
they
did
not
fail
to
find
me
out
and
welcome
me
to
the
crimea
while
captain
peel
and
sir
campbell
sent
the
kindest
messages
and
when
they
saw
me
promised
me
every
assistance
the
general
adding
that
he
is
glad
to
see
me
where
there
is
so
much
to
do
among
others
poor
vicars
whose
kind
face
had
so
often
lighted
up
my
old
house
in
kingston
came
to
take
me
by
the
hand
in
this
corner
of
the
world
i
never
felt
so
sure
of
the
success
of
any
step
as
i
did
of
this
before
i
had
been
a
week
in
balaclava
but
i
had
plenty
of
difficulties
to
contend
with
on
every
side
among
the
first
one
of
the
ships
in
which
were
many
of
our
stores
the
nonpareil
was
ordered
out
of
the
harbour
before
we
could
land
them
all
and
there
was
more
than
a
probability
that
she
would
carry
back
to
constantinople
many
of
the
things
we
had
most
pressing
occasion
for
it
became
necessary
therefore
that
some
one
should
see
admiral
boxer
and
try
to
interest
that
and
affable
officer
in
our
favour
when
i
mentioned
it
to
day
he
did
not
seem
inclined
to
undertake
the
mission
and
nothing
was
left
but
for
me
to
face
the
terrible
fortunately
captain
h
of
the
diamond
was
inclined
to
be
my
friend
and
not
a
little
amused
with
his
mission
carried
me
right
off
to
the
admiral
i
confess
that
i
was
as
nearly
frightened
out
of
my
wits
as
i
ever
have
been
for
the
admiral
kind
heart
beat
under
a
decidedly
rough
husk
and
when
captain
h
told
him
that
i
wanted
his
permission
for
the
nonpareil
to
remain
in
the
harbour
for
a
few
days
as
there
were
stores
on
board
he
let
fly
enough
hard
words
to
frighten
any
woman
but
when
i
spoke
up
and
told
him
that
i
had
known
his
son
in
the
west
indies
he
relented
and
granted
my
petition
but
it
was
not
without
more
hard
words
and
much
grumbling
that
a
parcel
of
women
should
be
coming
out
to
a
place
where
they
were
not
wanted
now
the
admiral
did
not
repeat
this
remark
a
few
days
afterwards
when
he
saw
me
attending
the
sick
and
wounded
upon
the
sick
wharf
i
remained
six
weeks
in
balaclava
spending
my
days
on
shore
and
my
nights
on
board
ship
over
our
stores
stacked
on
the
shore
a
few
sheets
of
rough
tarpaulin
were
suspended
and
beneath
these
my
sole
protection
against
the
crimean
rain
and
wind
i
spent
some
portion
of
each
day
receiving
visitors
and
selling
stores
but
my
chief
occupation
and
one
with
which
i
never
allowed
any
business
to
interfere
was
helping
the
doctors
to
transfer
the
sick
and
wounded
from
the
mules
and
ambulances
into
the
transports
that
had
to
carry
them
to
the
hospitals
of
scutari
and
buyukdere
i
did
not
forget
the
main
object
of
my
journey
to
which
i
would
have
devoted
myself
exclusively
had
i
been
allowed
and
very
familiar
did
i
become
before
long
with
the
sick
wharf
of
balaclava
my
acquaintance
with
it
began
very
shortly
after
i
had
reached
balaclava
the
very
first
day
that
i
approached
the
wharf
a
party
of
sick
and
wounded
had
just
arrived
here
was
work
for
me
i
felt
sure
with
so
many
patients
the
doctors
must
be
glad
of
all
the
hands
they
could
get
indeed
so
strong
was
the
old
impulse
within
me
that
i
waited
for
no
permission
but
seeing
a
poor
artilleryman
stretched
upon
a
pallet
groaning
heavily
i
ran
up
to
him
at
once
and
eased
the
stiff
dressings
lightly
my
practised
fingers
ran
over
the
familiar
work
and
well
was
i
rewarded
when
the
poor
fellow
groans
subsided
into
a
restless
uneasy
mutter
god
help
him
he
had
been
hit
in
the
forehead
and
i
think
his
sight
was
gone
i
stooped
down
and
raised
some
tea
to
his
baked
lips
here
and
there
upon
the
wharf
were
rows
of
little
pannikins
containing
this
beverage
then
his
hand
touched
mine
and
rested
there
and
i
heard
him
mutter
indistinctly
as
though
the
discovery
had
arrested
his
wandering
senses
ha
this
is
surely
a
woman
hand
i
could
say
much
but
i
tried
to
whisper
something
about
hope
and
trust
in
god
but
all
the
while
i
think
his
thoughts
were
running
on
this
strange
discovery
perhaps
i
had
brought
to
his
poor
mind
memories
of
his
home
and
the
loving
ones
there
who
would
ask
no
greater
favour
than
the
privilege
of
helping
him
thus
for
he
continued
to
hold
my
hand
in
his
feeble
grasp
and
whisper
god
bless
you
whoever
you
are
god
bless
you
over
and
over
again
i
do
not
think
that
the
surgeons
noticed
me
at
first
although
as
this
was
my
introduction
to
balaclava
i
had
not
neglected
my
personal
appearance
and
wore
my
favourite
yellow
dress
and
blue
bonnet
with
the
red
ribbons
but
i
noticed
one
coming
to
me
who
i
think
would
have
laughed
very
merrily
had
it
not
been
for
the
poor
fellow
at
my
feet
as
it
was
he
came
forward
and
shook
hands
very
kindly
saying
how
do
you
do
much
obliged
to
you
for
looking
after
my
poor
fellow
very
glad
to
see
you
here
and
glad
they
always
were
the
doctors
to
let
me
help
them
look
after
the
sick
and
wounded
sufferers
brought
to
that
fearful
wharf
i
wonder
if
i
can
ever
forget
the
scenes
i
witnessed
there
oh
they
were
heartrending
i
declare
that
i
saw
rough
bearded
men
stand
by
and
cry
like
the
women
at
the
sights
of
suffering
they
saw
while
some
who
scorned
comfort
for
themselves
would
fidget
about
for
hours
before
the
long
trains
of
mules
and
ambulances
came
in
nervous
lest
the
most
trifling
thing
that
could
minister
to
the
sufferers
comfort
should
be
neglected
i
have
often
heard
men
talk
and
preach
very
learnedly
and
conclusively
about
the
great
wickedness
and
selfishness
of
the
human
heart
i
used
to
wonder
whether
they
would
have
modified
those
opinions
if
they
had
been
my
companions
for
one
day
of
the
six
weeks
i
spent
upon
that
wharf
and
seen
but
one
day
experience
of
the
christian
sympathy
and
brotherly
love
shown
by
the
strong
to
the
weak
the
task
was
a
trying
one
and
familiarity
you
might
think
would
have
worn
down
their
keener
feelings
of
pity
and
sympathy
but
it
was
not
so
i
was
in
the
midst
of
my
sad
work
one
day
when
the
admiral
came
up
and
stood
looking
on
he
vouchsafed
no
word
nor
look
of
recognition
in
answer
to
my
salute
but
stood
silently
by
his
hands
behind
his
back
watching
the
sick
being
lifted
into
the
boats
you
might
have
thought
that
he
had
little
feeling
so
stern
and
expressionless
was
his
face
but
once
when
they
raised
a
sufferer
somewhat
awkwardly
and
he
groaned
deeply
that
rough
man
broke
out
all
at
once
with
an
oath
that
was
strangely
like
a
prayer
and
bade
the
men
for
god
sake
take
more
care
and
coming
up
to
me
he
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
saying
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
old
lady
among
these
poor
fellows
while
i
am
most
strangely
deceived
if
i
did
not
see
a
gathering
in
his
eye
it
was
on
this
same
day
i
think
that
bending
down
over
a
poor
fellow
whose
senses
had
quite
gone
and
i
fear
me
would
never
return
to
him
in
this
world
he
took
me
for
his
wife
and
calling
me
mary
mary
many
times
asked
me
how
it
was
he
had
got
home
so
quickly
and
why
he
did
not
see
the
children
and
said
he
felt
sure
he
should
soon
get
better
now
poor
fellow
i
could
not
undeceive
him
i
think
the
fancy
happily
caused
by
the
touch
of
a
woman
hand
soothed
his
dying
hour
for
i
do
not
fancy
he
could
have
lived
to
reach
scutari
i
never
knew
it
for
certain
but
i
always
felt
sure
that
he
would
never
wake
from
that
dream
of
home
in
this
world
and
here
lest
the
reader
should
consider
that
i
am
speaking
too
highly
of
my
own
actions
i
must
have
recourse
to
a
plan
which
i
shall
frequently
adopt
in
the
following
pages
and
let
another
voice
speak
for
me
in
the
kind
letter
received
long
after
balaclava
had
been
left
to
its
old
masters
by
one
who
had
not
forgotten
his
old
companion
on
the
the
writer
major
then
captain
r
had
charge
of
the
wharf
while
i
was
there
glasgow
dear
seacole
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
that
you
have
been
unfortunate
in
business
but
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
have
found
friends
in
lord
r
and
others
who
are
ready
to
help
you
no
one
knows
better
than
i
do
how
much
you
did
to
help
poor
sick
and
wounded
soldiers
and
i
feel
sure
you
will
find
in
your
day
of
trouble
that
they
have
not
forgotten
it
major
r
was
a
brave
and
experienced
officer
but
the
scenes
on
the
unmanned
him
often
i
have
known
him
nervously
restless
if
the
people
were
behindhand
even
for
a
few
minutes
in
their
preparations
for
the
wounded
but
in
this
feeling
all
shared
alike
only
women
could
have
done
more
than
they
did
who
attended
to
this
melancholy
duty
and
they
not
because
their
hearts
could
be
softer
but
because
their
hands
are
moulded
for
this
work
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
we
had
no
cheerful
scenes
upon
the
sometimes
a
fellow
generally
a
sailor
would
forget
his
pain
and
do
his
best
to
keep
the
rest
in
good
spirits
once
i
heard
my
name
eagerly
pronounced
and
turning
round
recognised
a
sailor
whom
i
remembered
as
one
of
the
crew
of
the
alarm
stationed
at
kingston
a
few
years
back
why
as
i
live
if
this
ai
aunty
seacole
of
jamaica
shiver
all
that
left
of
my
poor
timbers
and
i
saw
that
the
left
leg
was
gone
if
this
ai
a
rum
go
mates
ah
my
man
i
sorry
to
see
you
in
this
sad
plight
never
fear
for
me
aunty
seacole
i
make
the
best
of
the
leg
the
rooshians
have
left
me
i
get
at
them
soon
again
never
fear
you
do
think
messmates
he
never
left
his
wounded
comrades
alone
that
they
think
less
of
us
at
home
for
coming
back
with
a
limb
or
so
short
you
bear
your
troubles
well
my
son
eh
do
i
aunty
and
he
seemed
surprised
why
when
seen
so
many
pretty
fellows
knocked
off
the
ship
roll
altogether
do
you
think
i
ought
to
be
thankful
if
i
can
answer
the
call
anyhow
and
this
was
the
sailors
philosophy
always
and
this
brave
fellow
after
he
had
sipped
some
lemonade
and
laid
down
when
he
heard
the
men
groaning
raised
his
head
and
comforted
them
in
the
same
strain
again
and
it
may
seem
strange
but
it
quieted
them
i
used
to
make
on
board
the
medora
with
eggs
brought
from
constantinople
only
the
other
day
captain
s
who
had
charge
of
the
medora
reminded
me
of
them
these
with
some
lemonade
were
all
the
doctors
would
allow
me
to
give
to
the
wounded
they
all
liked
the
cake
poor
fellows
better
than
anything
else
perhaps
because
it

my
life
in
balaclava
could
not
but
be
a
rough
one
the
exposure
by
day
was
enough
to
try
any
woman
strength
and
at
night
one
was
not
always
certain
of
repose
nor
was
it
the
easiest
thing
to
clamber
up
the
steep
sides
of
the
medora
and
more
than
once
i
narrowly
escaped
a
sousing
in
the
harbour
why
it
should
be
so
difficult
to
climb
a
ship
side
when
a
few
more
staves
in
the
ladder
and
those
a
little
broader
would
make
it
so
easy
i
have
never
been
able
to
guess
and
once
on
board
the
medora
my
berth
would
not
altogether
have
suited
a
delicate
female
with
weak
nerves
it
was
an
ammunition
ship
and
we
slept
over
barrels
of
gunpowder
and
tons
of
cartridges
with
the
by
no
means
impossible
contingency
of
their
prematurely
igniting
and
giving
us
no
time
to
say
our
prayers
before
launching
us
into
eternity
great
care
was
enjoined
and
at
eight
every
evening
captain
s
would
come
down
and
order
all
lights
out
for
the
night
but
i
used
to
put
my
lantern
into
a
deep
basin
behind
some
boxes
and
so
evaded
the
regulation
i
felt
rather
ashamed
of
this
breach
of
discipline
one
night
when
another
ammunition
ship
caught
fire
in
the
crowded
harbour
and
threatened
us
all
with
speedy
destruction
we
all
knew
if
they
failed
in
extinguishing
the
fire
pretty
quickly
what
our
chances
of
life
were
worth
and
i
think
the
bravest
drew
his
breath
heavily
at
the
thought
of
our
danger
fortunately
they
succeeded
in
extinguishing
the
firebrand
before
any
mischief
was
done
but
i
do
not
think
the
crew
of
the
medora
slept
very
comfortably
that
night
it
was
said
that
the
russians
had
employed
an
incendiary
but
it
would
have
been
strange
if
in
that
densely
crowded
harbour
some
accidents
had
not
happened
without
their
agency
harassing
work
indeed
was
the
getting
our
stores
on
shore
with
the
aid
of
the
greek
and
maltese
boatmen
whose
profession
is
thievery
not
only
did
they
demand
exorbitant
sums
for
the
carriage
but
they
contrived
to
rob
us
by
the
way
in
the
most
ingenious
manner
thus
many
things
of
value
were
lost
in
the
little
journey
from
the
albatross
and
nonpareil
to
the
shore
which
had
made
the
long
voyage
from
england
safely
keep
as
sharp
a
look
out
as
i
might
some
package
or
box
would
be
tipped
overboard
by
the
sudden
swaying
of
the
boat
or
passing
by
of
one
of
the
boatmen
of
course
accidentally
and
no
words
could
induce
the
rascals
in
their
feigned
ignorance
of
my
language
to
stop
and
looking
back
at
the
helpless
waif
it
was
not
altogether
consolatory
to
see
another
boat
dart
from
between
some
shipping
where
it
had
been
waiting
as
accidentally
ready
to
pounce
upon
any
such
wind
or
waterfalls
still
more
harassing
work
was
it
to
keep
the
things
together
on
the
shore
often
in
the
open
light
of
day
while
i
sat
there
after
my
duties
on
the
were
over
selling
stores
or
administering
medicine
to
the
men
of
the
land
transport
and
army
works
corps
and
others
who
soon
found
out
my
skill
valuable
things
would
be
abstracted
while
there
was
no
limit
to
the
depredations
by
night
of
course
we
hired
men
to
watch
but
our
choice
of
servants
was
very
limited
and
very
often
those
we
employed
not
only
shut
their
eyes
to
the
plunder
of
their
companions
but
helped
themselves
freely
the
adage
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
answered
very
badly
in
balaclava
sometimes
jew
johnny
would
volunteer
to
watch
for
the
night
and
glad
i
was
when
i
knew
that
the
honest
fellow
was
there
one
night
he
caught
a
turk
making
off
with
a
firkin
of
butter
and
some
other
things
the
fellow
broke
away
from
johnny
grasp
with
the
butter
but
the
lad
marked
him
down
to
his
wretched
den
behind
the
engineers
quarters
and
on
the
following
morning
quietly
introduced
me
to
the
lazy
culprit
who
was
making
up
for
the
partial
loss
of
his
night
rest
among
as
a
set
of
comrades
as
i
have
ever
seen
there
was
a
great
row
and
much
indignation
shown
at
the
purpose
of
my
visit
but
i
considered
myself
justified
in
calling
in
the
aid
of
one
of
the
provost
marshal
officers
and
in
the
presence
of
this
most
invaluable
official
a
confession
was
soon
made
beneath
the
fellow
dirty
bed
the
butter
was
found
buried
and
in
its
company
a
case
of
sherry
which
the
rogue
had
in
flagrant
defiance
of
the
prophet
injunction
stolen
for
his
own
private
drinking
a
few
nights
previously
the
thievery
in
this
little
way
port
was
something
marvellous
and
the
skill
and
ingenuity
of
the
operators
would
have
reflected
credit
upon
the
of
their
profession
practising
in
the
most
civilized
city
of
europe
nor
was
the
thievery
confined
altogether
to
the
professionals
who
had
crowded
to
this
scene
of
action
from
the
cities
and
islands
of
the
mediterranean
they
robbed
us
the
turks
and
one
another
but
a
stronger
hand
was
sometimes
laid
on
them
the
turk
however
was
sure
to
be
the
victim
let
who
might
be
the
oppressor
in
this
predatory
warfare
as
in
more
honourable
service
the
zouaves
particularly
distinguished
themselves
these
undoubtedly
gallant
little
fellows
always
restless
for
action
of
some
sort
would
when
the
luxury
of
a
brash
with
the
russians
was
occasionally
denied
them
come
down
to
balaclava
in
search
of
opportunities
of
waging
war
against
society
at
large
their
complete
and
utter
absence
of
conscientious
scruples
as
to
the
rights
of
property
was
most
amusing
to
see
a
zouave
gravely
cheat
a
turk
or
trip
up
a
greek
or
maltese
and
scud
away
with
the
spoil
cleverly
stowed
in
his
roomy
red
pantaloons
was
an
operation
for
its
coolness
expedition
and
perfectness
well
worth
seeing
and
to
a
great
extent
they
escaped
scatheless
for
the
english
provost
marshal
department
was
rather
chary
of
interfering
with
the
eccentricities
of
our
gallant
allies
while
if
the
french
had
taken
close
cognizance
of
the
zouaves
amusements
out
of
school
of
the
regiments
would
have
been
always
engaged
punishing
the
other
half
the
poor
turk
it
is
lamentable
to
think
how
he
was
robbed
abused
and
bullied
by
his
friends
why
did
he
show
a
little
pluck
there
was
a
rough
sailor
or
shrewd
boy
the
english
boy
in
all
his
impudence
and
prejudice
flourished
in
balaclava
who
would
not
gladly
have
patted
him
upon
the
back
if
he
would
but
have
held
up
his
head
and
shown
ever
so
little
spirit
but
the
englishman
can
not
understand
a
coward
will
scarcely
take
the
trouble
to
pity
him
and
even
the
craven
greek
could
lord
it
over
the
degenerate
descendants
of
the
fierce
arabs
who
so
they
told
me
on
the
spot
had
wrested
constantinople
from
the
christians
in
those
old
times
of
which
i
know
so
little
very
often
an
injured
turk
would
run
up
to
where
i
sat
and
stand
there
wildly
telegraphing
his
complaints
against
some
greek
or
italian
whom
a
stout
english
lad
would
have
shaken
out
of
his
dirty
skin
in
five
minutes
once
however
i
saw
the
tables
turned
as
the
anecdote
will
help
to
illustrate
the
relative
positions
of
the
predatory
tribes
of
balaclava
i
will
narrate
it
hearing
one
morning
a
louder
hubbub
than
was
usual
upon
the
completion
of
a
bargain
and
the
inevitable
quarrelling
that
always
followed
i
went
up
to
where
i
saw
an
excited
crowd
collected
around
a
turk
in
whose
hands
a
greek
was
struggling
vainly
this
greek
had
it
seemed
robbed
his
enemy
but
the
turk
was
master
this
time
and
had
in
order
to
force
from
the
robber
a
confession
of
the
place
where
the
stolen
things
were
deposited
like
dogs
as
they
were
these
fellows
were
fond
of
burying
their
plunder
resorted
to
torture
this
was
effected
most
ingeniously
and
simply
by
means
of
some
packthread
which
bound
round
the
greek
two
thumbs
was
tightened
on
the
tourniquet
principle
until
the
pain
elicited
a
confession
but
the
turk
stimulated
to
retaliation
by
his
triumph
bagged
the
greek
basket
which
contained
amongst
other
things
two
watches
which
their
present
owner
had
no
doubt
stolen
driven
to
the
most
ludicrous
show
of
despair
the
greek
was
about
to
attempt
another
desperate
struggle
for
the
recovery
of
his
goods
when
two
zouaves
elbowed
their
small
persons
upon
the
crowded
stage
and
were
eagerly
referred
to
by
all
the
parties
concerned
in
the
squabble
how
they
contrived
it
i
can
not
say
so
prompt
were
their
movements
but
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
watches
were
in
their
possession
and
going
much
faster
than
was
agreeable
either
to
turk
or
greek
who
both
combined
to
arrest
this
new
movement
and
thereby
added
a
sharp
thrashing
to
their
other
injuries
the
zouaves
effected
their
escape
safely
while
the
greek
with
a
despair
that
had
in
it
an
equal
share
of
the
ludicrous
and
the
tragic
threw
himself
upon
the
dusty
ground
and
tore
his
thin
hair
out
by
handfuls
i
believe
that
the
poor
wretch
whom
we
could
not
help
pitying
journeyed
to
kamiesch
to
discover
his
oppressors
but
i
fear
he
did
gain
much
information
there
had
it
not
been
for
the
unremitting
activity
of
the
authorities
no
life
would
have
been
safe
in
balaclava
with
its
population
of
villains
of
every
nation
as
it
was
murder
was
sometimes
added
to
robbery
and
many
of
the
rascals
themselves
died
suspicious
deaths
with
the
particulars
of
which
the
authorities
did
not
trouble
themselves
but
the
officials
worked
hard
both
in
the
harbour
and
on
shore
to
keep
order
few
men
could
have
worked
harder
i
often
saw
the
old
admiral
about
before
the
sun
had
fairly
shown
itself
and
those
of
his
subordinates
must
have
been
somewhat
heavy
sleepers
who
could
play
the
sluggard
then
at
length
the
necessary
preparations
to
establish
our
store
were
made
we
hit
upon
a
spot
about
two
miles
from
balaclava
in
advance
of
kadikoi
close
to
where
the
railway
engines
were
stationed
and
within
a
mile
of
leave
having
been
obtained
to
erect
buildings
here
we
set
to
work
briskly
and
soon
altered
the
appearance
of
spring
hill
so
we
christened
our
new
home
sometimes
on
horseback
sometimes
getting
a
lift
on
the
commissariat
carts
and
occasionally
on
the
ammunition
i
managed
to
visit
spring
hill
daily
and
very
soon
fitted
up
a
shed
sufficiently
large
to
take
up
my
abode
in
but
the
difficulty
of
building
our
store
was
immense
to
obtain
material
was
next
to
impossible
but
that
collected
not
a
little
was
by
leave
of
the
admiral
gleaned
from
the
floating
rubbish
in
the
harbour
to
find
workmen
to
make
use
of
it
was
still
more
difficult
i
spent
days
going
round
the
shipping
offering
great
wages
even
for
an
invalid
able
to
handle
saw
and
hammer
however
roughly
and
many
a
long
ride
through
the
camps
did
i
take
on
the
same
errand
at
length
by
dint
of
hard
canvassing
we
obtained
the
aid
of
two
english
sailors
whom
i
nicknamed
big
and
little
chips
and
some
turks
and
set
to
work
in
good
earnest
i
procured
the
turks
from
the
pacha
who
commanded
the
division
encamped
in
the
neighbourhood
of
spring
hill
it
was
decided
that
we
should
apply
to
him
for
help
and
accordingly
i
became
ambassadress
on
this
delicate
mission
and
rode
over
to
the
pacha
quarters
jew
johnny
attending
me
as
interpreter
i
was
received
by
the
pacha
with
considerable
kindness
and
no
trifling
amount
of
formality
and
after
taking
coffee
i
proceeded
through
jew
johnny
to
explain
the
object
of
my
visit
while
his
excellency
a
tall
man
with
a
dark
pleasing
face
smoked
gravely
and
took
my
request
into
his
gracious
consideration
on
the
following
day
came
the
answer
to
my
request
in
the
persons
of
two
curious
turkish
carpenters
who
were
placed
at
our
orders
after
a
little
while
too
a
turkish
officer
whom
i
christened
captain
ali
baba
took
so
great
an
interest
in
our
labours
that
he
would
work
like
any
carpenter
and
with
a
delight
and
zeal
that
were
astonishing
to
see
him
fall
back
and
look
smilingly
at
every
piece
of
his
workmanship
was
a
sight
to
restore
the
most
severely
tried
temper
i
really
think
that
the
fellow
thought
it
splendid
fun
and
never
wearied
of
it
but
for
him
i
do
not
know
how
we
should
have
managed
with
our
other
turkish
chips
chips
of
the
true
old
turkish
block
they
were
deliberate
slow
and
indolent
breaking
off
into
endless
interruptions
for
the
sacred
duties
of
eating
and
praying
and
getting
into
corners
at
all
times
of
the
day
to
smoke
themselves
to
sleep
in
the
midst
of
our
work
a
calamity
occurred
which
was
very
nearly
becoming
a
catastrophe
by
the
giving
way
of
a
dam
after
some
heavy
rains
the
little
stream
which
threaded
its
silvery
way
past
spring
hill
swelled
without
any
warning
into
a
torrent
which
sweeping
through
my
temporary
hut
very
nearly
carried
us
all
away
and
destroyed
stores
of
between
one
and
two
hundred
pounds
in
value
this
calamity
might
have
had
a
tragical
issue
for
me
for
seeing
a
little
box
which
contained
some
things
valuable
as
relics
of
the
past
being
carried
away
i
plunged
in
after
it
and
losing
my
balance
was
rolled
over
and
over
by
the
stream
and
with
some
difficulty
reached
the
shore
some
of
lord
raglan
staff
passing
our
wreck
on
the
following
day
made
inquiries
respecting
the
loss
we
had
sustained
and
a
messenger
was
sent
from
who
made
many
purchases
in
token
of
their
sympathy
my
visit
to
the
turkish
pacha
laid
the
foundation
of
a
lasting
friendship
he
soon
found
his
way
to
spring
hill
and
before
long
became
one
of
my
best
customers
and
most
frequent
visitors
it
was
astonishing
to
note
how
completely
now
that
he
was
in
the
land
of
the
giaours
he
adapted
himself
to
the
tastes
and
habits
of
the
infidels
like
a
scotch
presbyterian
on
the
continent
for
a
holiday
he
threw
aside
all
the
prejudices
of
his
education
and
drank
bottled
beer
sherry
and
champagne
with
an
appreciation
of
their
qualities
that
no
christian
could
have
expressed
more
gratefully
he
was
very
affable
with
us
all
and
would
sometimes
keep
jew
johnny
away
from
his
work
for
hours
chatting
with
us
or
the
english
officers
who
would
lounge
into
our
as
yet
unfinished
store
sometimes
he
would
come
down
to
breakfast
and
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
day
at
spring
hill
indeed
the
wits
of
spring
hill
used
to
laugh
and
say
that
the
crafty
pacha
was
throwing
his
at
madame
seacole
widow
but
as
the
honest
fellow
candidly
confessed
he
had
three
wives
already
at
home
i
acquit
him
of
any
desire
to
add
to
their
number
the
pacha
great
ambition
was
to
be
familiar
with
the
english
language
and
at
last
nothing
would
do
but
he
must
take
lessons
of
me
so
he
would
come
down
and
sitting
in
my
store
with
a
turk
or
so
at
his
feet
to
attend
to
his
most
important
pipe
by
inserting
little
pieces
of
charcoal
at
intervals
would
try
hard
to
sow
a
few
english
sentences
in
his
treacherous
memory
he
never
got
beyond
half
a
dozen
and
i
think
if
we
had
continued
in
the
relation
of
pupil
and
mistress
until
now
the
number
would
not
have
been
increased
greatly
madame
seacole
gentlemen
good
morning
and
more
champagne
with
each
syllable
much
dwelt
upon
were
his
favourite
sentences
it
was
capital
fun
to
hear
him
when
i
was
called
away
suddenly
to
attend
to
a
customer
or
to
give
a
sick
man
medicine
repeating
gravely
the
sentence
we
had
been
studying
until
i
passed
him
and
started
him
with
another
very
frequently
he
would
compliment
me
by
ordering
his
band
down
to
spring
hill
for
my
amusement
they
played
excellently
well
and
i
used
to
think
that
i
preferred
their
music
to
that
of
the
french
and
english
regimental
bands
i
laughed
heartily
one
day
when
in
compliance
with
the
pacha
orders
they
came
out
with
a
grand
new
tune
in
which
i
with
difficulty
recognised
a
very
distant
resemblance
to
god
save
the
queen
altogether
he
was
a
capital
neighbour
and
gave
such
strict
orders
to
his
men
to
respect
our
property
that
we
rarely
lost
anything
on
the
whole
the
turks
were
the
most
honest
of
the
nations
there
i
except
the
english
and
the
sardinians
and
the
most
tractable
but
the
greeks
hated
them
and
showed
their
hate
in
every
way
in
bringing
up
things
for
the
pacha
use
they
would
let
the
mules
down
and
smash
their
loads
most
relentlessly
now
and
then
they
suffered
as
was
the
case
one
day
when
i
passed
through
the
camp
and
saw
my
friend
superintending
the
correction
of
a
greek
who
was
being
bastinadoed
it
seemed
a
painful
punishment
i
was
sorry
therefore
when
my
friend
division
was
ordered
to
kamara
and
we
lost
our
neighbours
but
my
pupil
did
not
forget
his
schoolmistress
a
few
days
after
they
had
left
the
neighbourhood
of
spring
hill
came
a
messenger
with
a
present
of
lambs
poultry
and
eggs
and
a
letter
which
i
could
not
decipher
as
many
of
the
interpreters
could
speak
english
far
better
than
they
could
write
it
but
we
discovered
that
the
letter
contained
an
invitation
to
day
and
myself
to
go
over
to
kamara
and
select
from
the
spoil
of
the
village
anything
that
might
be
useful
in
our
new
buildings
and
a
few
days
later
came
over
a
large
araba
drawn
by
four
mules
and
laden
with
a
pair
of
and
some
which
the
thoughtful
kind
pacha
had
judged
and
judged
rightly
would
be
a
very
acceptable
present
and
very
often
the
fellow
would
ride
over
from
kamara
and
resume
his
acquaintance
with
myself
and
my
champagne
and
practise
his
english
sentences
we
felt
the
loss
of
our
turkish
neighbours
in
more
ways
than
one
the
neighbourhood
after
their
departure
was
left
lonely
and
unprotected
and
it
was
not
until
a
division
of
the
land
transport
corps
came
and
took
up
their
quarters
near
us
that
i
felt
at
all
secure
of
personal
safety
day
rarely
returned
to
spring
hill
until
nightfall
relieved
him
from
his
many
duties
and
i
depended
chiefly
upon
two
sailors
both
of
questionable
character
two
black
servants
jew
johnny
and
my
own
reputation
for
determination
and
courage
a
poor
delusion
which
i
took
care
to
heighten
by
the
judicious
display
of
a
pistol
lent
me
for
the
purpose
by
day
and
which
i
could
have
loaded
to
save
my
life

powdering

summer
was
fairly
advanced
before
the
british
hotel
was
anything
like
finished
indeed
it
never
was
completed
and
when
we
left
the
hill
a
year
later
it
still
wanted
shutters
but
long
before
that
time
spring
hill
had
gained
a
great
reputation
of
course
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
occurred
in
the
camp
although
i
could
not
help
hearing
a
great
deal
about
it
mismanagement
and
privation
there
might
have
been
but
my
business
was
to
make
things
right
in
my
sphere
and
whatever
confusion
and
disorder
existed
elsewhere
comfort
and
order
were
always
to
be
found
at
spring
hill
when
there
was
no
sun
elsewhere
some
few
gleams
so
its
grateful
visitors
said
always
seemed
to
have
stayed
behind
to
cheer
the
weary
soldiers
that
gathered
in
the
british
hotel
and
perhaps
as
my
kind
friend
said
after
all
these
things
had
become
pleasant
memories
of
the
past
the
cold
without
gave
a
zest
no
doubt
to
the
welcome
warmth
within
but
her
smile
good
old
soul
lent
heat
to
the
coal
and
power
to
the
pannikin
let
me
in
a
few
words
describe
the
british
hotel
it
was
acknowledged
by
all
to
be
the
most
complete
thing
there
it
cost
no
less
than
the
buildings
and
yards
took
up
at
least
an
acre
of
ground
and
were
as
perfect
as
we
could
make
them
the
hotel
and
storehouse
consisted
of
a
long
iron
room
with
counters
closets
and
shelves
above
it
was
another
low
room
used
by
us
for
storing
our
goods
and
above
this
floated
a
large
attached
to
this
building
was
a
little
kitchen
not
unlike
a
ship
caboose
all
stoves
and
shelves
in
addition
to
the
iron
house
were
two
wooden
houses
with
sleeping
apartments
for
myself
and
day
for
our
servants
a
canteen
for
the
soldiery
and
a
large
enclosed
yard
for
our
stock
full
of
stables
low
huts
and
sties
everything
although
rough
and
unpolished
was
comfortable
and
warm
and
there
was
a
completeness
about
the
whole
which
won
general
admiration
the
reader
may
judge
of
the
manner
in
which
we
had
stocked
the
interior
of
our
store
from
the
remark
often
repeated
by
the
officers
that
you
might
get
everything
at
mother
seacole
from
an
anchor
down
to
a
needle
in
addition
we
had
for
our
transport
service
four
carts
and
as
many
horses
and
mules
as
could
be
kept
from
the
thieves
to
reckon
upon
being
in
possession
of
these
at
any
future
time
was
impossible
we
have
more
than
once
seen
a
fair
stud
stabled
at
and
on
the
following
morning
been
compelled
to
borrow
cattle
from
the
land
transport
camp
to
fetch
our
things
up
from
balaclava
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
my
domestic
difficulties
came
to
an
end
with
the
completion
of
the
hotel
true
i
was
in
a
better
position
to
bear
the
crimean
cold
and
rain
but
my
other
foes
were
as
busy
as
ever
they
had
been
on
the
beach
at
balaclava
thieves
biped
and
quadruped
human
and
animal
troubled
me
more
than
ever
and
perhaps
the
most
difficult
to
deal
with
were
the
least
dangerous
the
crimean
rats
for
instance
who
had
the
appetites
of
london
aldermen
and
were
as
little
dainty
as
hungry
schoolboys
whether
they
had
left
sebastopol
guided
by
the
instinct
which
leads
their
kindred
in
other
parts
of
the
world
to
forsake
sinking
ships
or
because
the
garrison
rations
offended
their
palates
or
whether
they
had
patriotically
emigrated
to
make
war
against
the
english
larders
i
do
not
pretend
to
guess
but
whatever
was
their
motive
it
drew
them
in
great
abundance
to
spring
hill
they
occasionally
did
us
damage
in
a
single
night
to
the
tune
of
two
or
three
pounds
wasting
what
they
could
not
devour
you
could
keep
nothing
sacred
from
their
strong
teeth
when
hard
pressed
they
more
than
once
attacked
the
live
sheep
and
at
last
they
went
so
far
as
to
nibble
one
of
our
black
cooks
francis
who
slept
among
the
flour
barrels
on
the
following
morning
he
came
to
me
his
eyes
rolling
angrily
and
his
white
teeth
gleaming
to
show
me
a
mangled
finger
which
they
had
bitten
and
ask
me
to
dress
it
he
made
a
great
fuss
and
a
few
mornings
later
he
came
in
a
violent
passion
this
time
and
gave
me
instant
notice
to
quit
my
service
although
we
were
paying
him
two
pounds
a
week
with
board
and
rations
this
time
the
rats
had
it
appeared
been
bolder
and
attacked
his
head
in
a
spot
where
its
natural
armour
the
wool
was
thinnest
and
the
silly
fellow
had
a
notion
that
the
souls
of
the
slain
russian
soldiers
had
entered
the
bodies
of
the
rats
and
made
vengeful
war
upon
their
late
enemies
driven
to
such
an
extremity
i
made
up
my
mind
to
scour
the
camp
in
search
of
a
cat
and
after
a
long
day
hunt
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
tale
of
whittington
was
by
no
means
an
improbable
one
indeed
had
a
brisk
young
fellow
with
a
cat
of
even
ordinary
skill
in
its
profession
made
their
appearance
at
spring
hill
i
would
gladly
have
put
them
in
the
way
of
laying
the
foundation
at
least
of
a
fortune
at
last
i
found
a
benefactor
in
the
camp
in
colonel
d
of
the
coldstreams
who
kindly
promised
me
a
great
pet
well
known
in
the
camp
and
perhaps
by
some
who
may
read
these
pages
by
the
name
of
pinkie
pinkie
was
then
helping
a
brother
officer
to
clear
his
hut
but
on
the
following
day
a
guardsman
brought
the
noble
fellow
down
he
lived
in
clover
for
a
few
days
but
he
had
an
english
attachment
for
his
old
house
and
despite
the
abundance
of
game
pinkie
soon
stole
away
to
his
old
quarters
three
miles
off
more
than
once
the
men
brought
him
back
to
me
but
the
attractions
of
spring
hill
were
never
strong
enough
to
detain
him
long
with
me
from
the
human
thieves
that
surrounded
spring
hill
i
had
to
stand
as
sharp
a
siege
as
the
russians
had
in
that
poor
city
against
which
we
heard
the
guns
thundering
daily
while
the
most
cunning
and
desperate
sorties
were
often
made
upon
the
most
exposed
parts
of
my
defences
and
sometimes
with
success
scores
of
the
keenest
eyes
and
hundreds
of
the
sharpest
fingers
in
the
world
were
always
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
least
oversight
i
had
to
keep
two
boys
whose
chief
occupation
was
to
watch
the
officers
horses
tied
up
to
the
doorposts
of
the
british
hotel
before
i
adopted
this
safeguard
more
than
one
officer
would
leave
his
horse
for
a
few
minutes
and
on
his
return
find
it
gone
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
naval
brigade
or
the
at
kamiesch
my
old
friends
the
zouaves
soon
found
me
out
at
spring
hill
and
the
wiry
gentry
spent
much
of
their
leisure
there
those
confounded
trowsers
of
theirs
offered
conveniences
of
which
they
made
rare
use
of
nothing
was
too
small
and
few
things
too
unwieldy
to
ride
in
them
like
the
pockets
of
clown
in
a
pantomime
they
could
accommodate
a
baby
or
a
pound
of
sausages
equally
well
i
have
a
firm
conviction
that
they
stuffed
turkeys
geese
and
fowls
into
them
and
i
positively
know
that
my
only
respectable
teapot
travelled
off
in
the
same
conveyance
while
i
detected
one
little
fellow
who
had
tied
them
down
tight
at
his
ankles
stowing
away
some
pounds
of
tea
and
coffee
mixed
some
officers
who
were
present
cut
the
cords
and
holding
up
the
little
scamp
by
the
neck
shook
his
trowsers
empty
amid
shouts
of
laughter
our
live
stock
from
the
horses
and
mules
down
to
the
geese
and
fowls
suffered
terribly
although
we
kept
a
sharp
by
day
and
paid
a
man
five
shillings
a
night
as
watchman
our
losses
were
very
great
during
the
time
we
were
in
the
crimea
we
lost
over
a
score
of
horses
four
mules
eighty
goats
many
sheep
pigs
and
poultry
by
thieving
alone
we
missed
in
a
single
night
forty
goats
and
seven
sheep
and
on
day
going
to
with
intelligence
of
the
disaster
they
told
him
that
lord
raglan
had
recently
received
forty
sheep
from
asia
all
of
which
had
disappeared
in
the
same
manner
the
geese
turkeys
and
fowls
vanished
by
scores
we
found
out
afterwards
that
the
watchman
paid
to
guard
the
sheep
used
to
kill
a
few
occasionally
as
he
represented
them
to
have
died
a
natural
death
during
the
night
he
got
permission
to
bury
them
instead
of
which
he
sold
them
king
frost
claimed
his
share
of
our
stock
too
and
on
one
december
night
of
the
winter
of
killed
no
less
than
forty
sheep
it
is
all
very
well
to
smile
at
these
things
now
but
at
the
time
they
were
heartrending
enough
and
helped
if
they
did
not
cause
the
ruin
which
eventually
overtook
the
firm
of
seacole
and
day
the
determination
and
zeal
which
besiegers
and
besieged
showed
with
respect
to
a
poor
pig
which
was
quietly
and
unconsciously
fattening
in
its
sty
are
worthy
of
record
fresh
pork
in
the
spring
of
was
certainly
one
of
those
luxuries
not
easily
obtainable
in
that
part
of
the
crimea
to
which
the
british
army
was
confined
and
when
it
became
known
that
mother
seacole
had
purchased
a
promising
young
porker
from
one
of
the
ships
in
balaclava
and
that
brave
woman
she
had
formed
the
courageous
resolution
of
fattening
it
for
her
favourites
the
excitement
among
the
frequenters
of
spring
hill
was
very
great
i
could
laugh
heartily
now
when
i
think
of
the
amount
of
persuasion
and
courting
i
stood
out
for
before
i
bound
myself
how
its
four
legs
were
to
be
disposed
of
i
learnt
more
at
that
time
of
the
trials
and
privileges
of
authority
than
i
am
ever
likely
to
experience
again
upon
my
word
i
think
if
the
poor
thing
had
possessed
as
many
legs
as
my
editor
tells
me
somebody
called
the
hydra
with
whom
my
readers
are
perhaps
more
familiar
than
i
am
had
heads
i
should
have
found
candidates
for
them
as
it
was
the
contest
for
those
i
had
to
bestow
was
very
keen
and
the
lucky
individuals
who
were
favoured
by
me
looked
after
their
interests
most
carefully
one
of
them
to
render
mistake
or
misunderstanding
impossible
entered
my
promise
in
my
the
reader
will
perhaps
smile
at
the
following
important
memorandum
in
the
gallant
officer
writing
memorandum
that
seacole
did
this
day
in
the
presence
of
major
a
and
lieutenant
w
promise
captain
h
a
leg
of
pig
now
it
was
well
known
that
many
greedy
eyes
and
fingers
were
directed
towards
the
plump
fellow
and
considerable
interest
was
manifested
in
the
result
of
the
struggle
seacole
thievery
i
think
they
had
some
confidence
in
me
and
that
i
was
the
favourite
but
there
was
a
large
field
against
me
which
found
its
backers
also
and
many
a
bet
was
laughingly
laid
on
the
ultimate
fate
of
the
unconscious
porker
i
baffled
many
a
knavish
trick
to
gain
possession
of
the
fine
fellow
but
after
all
i
lost
him
in
the
middle
of
the
day
when
i
thought
the
boldest
rogues
would
not
have
run
the
risk
the
shouts
and
laughter
of
some
officers
who
were
riding
down
from
the
front
first
informed
me
of
my
loss
up
they
rode
calling
out
mother
seacole
old
lady
quick
pig
gone
i
rushed
out
injured
woman
that
i
was
and
saw
it
all
at
a
glance
but
that
my
straw
was
in
the
way
i
could
have
torn
my
hair
in
my
vexation
i
rushed
to
the
sty
found
the
nest
warm
and
with
prompt
decision
prepared
for
speedy
pursuit
back
i
came
to
the
horsemen
calling
out
off
with
you
my
sons
they
ca
have
got
very
far
away
yet
do
your
best
to
save
my
bacon
delighted
with
the
fun
the
horsemen
dispersed
laughing
and
shouting
stole
away
hark
away
while
i
ran
indoors
turned
out
all
my
available
and
started
in
pursuit
also
not
half
a
mile
off
we
soon
saw
a
horseman
wave
his
cap
and
starting
off
into
a
run
came
to
a
little
hollow
where
the
poor
panting
animal
and
two
greek
thieves
had
been
run
down
the
took
the
latter
in
hand
willingly
and
piggy
was
brought
home
in
triumph
but
those
who
had
pork
expectancies
hearing
of
the
adventure
grew
so
seriously
alarmed
at
the
narrow
escape
that
they
petitioned
me
to
run
so
desperate
a
hazard
no
longer
and
the
poor
thing
was
killed
on
the
following
day
and
distributed
according
to
promise
a
certain
portion
was
reserved
for
sausages
which
fried
with
mashed
potatoes
were
quite
the
rage
at
the
british
hotel
for
some
days
some
pork
was
also
sent
to
with
an
account
of
the
dangers
we
ran
from
thieves
it
drew
the
following
kind
acknowledgment
from
general
b
my
dear
seacole
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
indeed
for
your
pork
i
have
spoken
to
colonel
p
as
to
the
police
of
your
neighbourhood
and
he
will
see
what
arrangement
can
be
made
for
the
general
protection
of
that
line
of
road
when
the
is
finished
you
will
be
better
off
let
me
know
at
the
time
of
any
depredations
that
are
committed
and
we
will
try
and
protect
i
am
faithfully
yours
l
b
for
the
truth
was
although
i
can
laugh
at
my
fears
now
i
was
often
most
horribly
frightened
at
spring
hill
and
there
was
cause
for
it
too
my
washerwoman
who
with
her
family
lived
not
half
a
mile
from
us
was
with
me
one
day
and
carried
off
some
things
for
the
on
the
following
morning
i
was
horrified
to
learn
that
she
her
father
husband
and
children
in
all
seven
had
been
most
foully
murdered
during
the
night
only
one
of
the
whole
family
recovered
from
her
wounds
and
lived
to
tell
the
tale
it
created
a
great
sensation
at
the
time
and
caused
me
to
pass
many
a
sleepless
night
for
the
murderers
were
never
discovered
whilst
i
am
upon
the
subject
of
crimean
thievery
i
may
as
well
exhaust
it
without
paying
any
regard
to
the
chronological
order
of
my
reminiscences
i
have
before
mentioned
what
i
suffered
from
the
french
one
day
i
caught
one
of
our
allies
in
my
kitchen
robbing
me
in
the
most
ungrateful
manner
he
had
met
with
an
accident
near
spring
hill
i
believe
he
belonged
to
a
french
regiment
lent
to
assist
the
english
in
and
had
been
doctored
by
me
and
now
i
found
him
filling
his
pockets
before
taking
french
leave
of
us
my
black
man
francis
pulled
from
his
pockets
a
yet
warm
fowl
and
other
provisions
we
kicked
him
off
the
premises
and
he
found
refuge
with
some
men
of
the
army
works
corps
who
pitied
him
and
gave
him
shelter
he
woke
them
in
the
middle
of
the
night
laying
hands
rather
clumsily
on
everything
that
was
removeable
and
in
the
morning
they
brought
him
to
me
to
ask
what
they
should
do
with
him
unluckily
for
him
a
french
officer
of
rank
happened
to
be
in
the
store
who
on
hearing
our
tale
packed
him
off
to
his
regiment
i
gathered
from
the
expression
of
the
officer
face
and
the
dread
legible
upon
the
culprit
that
it
might
be
some
considerable
time
before
his
itch
for
breaking
the
eighth
commandment
could
be
again
indulged
in
the
trouble
i
underwent
respecting
a
useful
black
mare
for
which
day
had
given
thirty
guineas
and
which
carried
me
beautifully
was
immense
before
it
had
been
many
weeks
in
our
store
it
was
gone
whither
i
failed
to
discover
keeping
my
eyes
wide
open
however
i
saw
angelina
so
i
christened
her
coming
quietly
down
the
hill
carrying
an
elderly
naval
officer
i
was
ready
to
receive
the
unconscious
couple
and
soon
made
my
claim
good
of
course
the
officer
was
not
to
blame
he
had
bought
it
of
a
sailor
who
in
his
turn
had
purchased
the
animal
of
a
messmate
who
of
course
had
obtained
it
from
another
and
so
on
but
eventually
it
returned
to
its
old
quarters
where
it
only
remained
about
a
fortnight
i
grew
tired
of
looking
for
angelina
and
had
given
her
up
when
one
day
she
turned
up
in
capital
condition
in
the
possession
of
a
french
officer
of
chasseurs
but
nothing
i
could
say
to
the
frenchman
would
induce
him
to
take
the
view
of
the
matter
i
wished
but
had
no
right
to
enforce
he
had
bought
the
horse
at
kamiesch
and
intended
to
keep
it
we
grew
hot
at
last
and
our
dispute
drew
out
so
large
an
audience
that
the
frenchman
took
alarm
and
tried
to
make
off
i
held
on
to
angelina
for
a
little
while
but
at
last
the
mare
broke
away
from
me
as
tam
shanter
maggie
did
from
the
witches
i
do
mean
that
she
left
me
even
her
tail
and
vanished
in
a
cloud
of
dust
it
was
the
last
i
ever
saw
of
angelina
more
than
once
the
crimean
thievery
reduced
us
to
woeful
straits
to
a
greek
returning
to
constantinople
we
entrusted
after
the
murder
of
our
washerwoman
two
trunks
containing
things
for
the
wash
which
he
was
to
bring
back
as
soon
as
possible
but
neither
upon
greek
trunks
nor
their
contents
did
we
ever
set
eyes
again
it
was
a
serious
loss
the
best
part
of
our
and
other
domestic
linen
all
my
clothes
except
two
suits
and
all
of
day
linen
vanished
and
had
to
be
replaced
as
best
we
could
by
fresh
purchases
from
kamiesch
and
kadikoi
perhaps
the
most
ridiculous
shift
i
was
ever
put
to
by
the
crimean
thieves
happened
when
we
rose
one
morning
and
found
the
greater
part
of
our
stud
missing
i
had
in
the
course
of
the
day
urgent
occasion
to
ride
over
to
the
french
camp
on
the
tchernaya
the
only
animal
available
for
my
transport
was
an
old
grey
mare
who
had
contracted
some
equine
disease
of
which
i
do
not
know
the
name
but
which
gave
her
considerable
resemblance
to
a
dog
suffering
from
the
mange
now
go
to
the
french
camp
i
must
to
borrow
a
horse
was
impossible
and
something
must
be
done
with
the
grey
suddenly
one
of
those
happy
thoughts
which
sometimes
help
us
over
our
greatest
difficulties
entered
into
my
scheming
brains
could
i
not
conceal
the
poor
worst
blemishes
her
colour
was
grey
would
not
a
thick
coating
of
flour
from
my
dredger
make
all
right
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
the
remedy
was
administered
successfully
and
off
i
started
but
alas
the
wind
was
high
and
swept
the
skirts
of
my
riding
habit
so
determinedly
against
the
side
of
the
poor
beast
that
before
long
its
false
coat
was
transferred
to
the
dark
cloth
and
my
innocent
exposed
the
french
are
proverbially
and
really
a
polite
and
considerate
nation
but
i
never
heard
more
hearty
peals
of
laughter
from
any
sides
than
those
which
conveyed
to
me
the
horrible
assurance
that
my
scheme
had
unhappily
failed
chapter
xiii
my
work
in
the
crimea
i
hope
the
reader
will
give
me
credit
for
the
assertion
that
i
am
about
to
make
that
i
enter
upon
the
particulars
of
this
chapter
with
great
reluctance
but
i
can
not
omit
them
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
strengthen
my
one
and
only
claim
to
interest
the
public
my
services
to
the
brave
british
army
in
the
crimea
but
fortunately
i
can
follow
a
course
which
will
not
only
render
it
unnecessary
for
me
to
sound
my
own
trumpet
but
will
be
more
satisfactory
to
the
reader
i
can
put
on
record
the
written
opinions
of
those
who
had
ample
means
of
judging
and
ascertaining
how
i
fulfilled
the
great
object
which
i
had
in
view
in
leaving
england
for
the
crimea
and
before
i
do
so
i
must
solicit
my
readers
attention
to
the
position
i
held
in
the
camp
as
doctress
nurse
and
mother
i
have
never
been
long
in
any
place
before
i
have
found
my
practical
experience
in
the
science
of
medicine
useful
even
in
london
i
have
found
it
of
service
to
others
and
in
the
crimea
where
the
doctors
were
so
overworked
and
sickness
was
so
prevalent
i
could
not
be
long
idle
for
i
never
forgot
that
my
intention
in
seeking
the
army
was
to
help
the
doctors
to
be
useful
to
whom
i
have
ever
looked
upon
and
still
regard
as
so
high
a
privilege
but
before
very
long
i
found
myself
surrounded
with
patients
of
my
own
and
this
for
two
simple
reasons
in
the
first
place
the
men
i
am
speaking
of
the
ranks
now
had
a
very
serious
objection
to
going
into
hospital
for
any
but
urgent
reasons
and
the
regimental
doctors
were
rather
fond
of
sending
them
there
and
in
the
second
place
they
could
and
did
get
at
my
store
and
nourishing
food
which
the
heads
of
the
medical
staff
would
sometimes
find
it
difficult
to
procure
these
reasons
with
the
additional
one
that
i
was
very
familiar
with
the
diseases
which
they
suffered
most
from
and
successful
in
their
treatment
i
say
this
in
no
spirit
of
vanity
were
quite
sufficient
to
account
for
the
numbers
who
came
daily
to
the
british
hotel
for
medical
treatment
that
the
officers
were
glad
of
me
as
a
doctress
and
nurse
may
be
easily
understood
when
a
poor
fellow
lay
sickening
in
his
cheerless
hut
and
sent
down
to
me
he
knew
very
well
that
i
should
not
ride
up
in
answer
to
his
message
and
although
i
did
not
hesitate
to
charge
him
with
the
value
of
the
necessaries
i
took
him
still
he
was
thankful
enough
to
be
able
to
them
when
we
lie
ill
at
home
surrounded
with
comfort
we
never
think
of
feeling
any
special
gratitude
for
the
delicacies
which
we
accept
as
a
consequence
of
our
illness
but
the
poor
officer
lying
ill
and
weary
in
his
crazy
hut
dependent
for
the
merest
necessaries
of
existence
upon
a
clumsy
ignorant
who
would
almost
prefer
eating
his
meat
raw
to
having
the
trouble
of
cooking
it
our
english
soldiers
are
bad
campaigners
often
finds
his
greatest
troubles
in
the
want
of
those
little
delicacies
with
which
a
weak
stomach
must
be
humoured
into
retaining
nourishment
how
often
have
i
felt
sad
at
the
sight
of
poor
lads
who
in
england
thought
attending
early
parade
a
hardship
and
felt
harassed
if
their
neckcloths
set
awry
or
the
natty
little
boots
would
not
retain
their
polish
bearing
and
bearing
so
nobly
and
bravely
trials
and
hardships
to
which
the
veteran
campaigner
frequently
succumbed
do
you
think
reader
if
you
were
lying
with
parched
lips
and
fading
appetite
thousands
of
miles
from
mother
wife
or
sister
loathing
the
rough
food
by
your
side
and
thinking
regretfully
of
that
english
home
where
nothing
that
could
minister
to
your
great
need
would
be
left
untried
do
you
think
that
you
would
welcome
the
familiar
figure
of
the
stout
lady
whose
bony
horse
has
just
pulled
up
at
the
door
of
your
hut
and
whose
panniers
contain
some
cooling
drink
a
little
broth
some
homely
cake
or
a
dish
of
jelly
or
do
you
think
under
such
circumstances
that
you
would
heartily
agree
with
my
friend
remark
that
face
with
a
kind
heart
trace
impressed
on
each
wrinkle
sly
was
a
sight
to
behold
through
the
rolled
across
that
iron
sky
i
tell
you
reader
i
have
seen
many
a
bold
fellow
eyes
moisten
at
such
a
season
when
a
woman
voice
and
a
woman
care
have
brought
to
their
minds
recollections
of
those
happy
english
homes
which
some
of
them
never
saw
again
but
many
did
who
will
remember
their
upon
the
bleak
and
barren
heights
before
sebastopol
then
their
calling
me
mother
was
not
i
think
altogether
unmeaning
i
used
to
fancy
that
there
was
something
homely
in
the
word
and
reader
you
can
not
think
how
dear
to
them
was
the
smallest
thing
that
reminded
them
of
home
some
of
my
crimean
patients
who
were
glad
of
me
as
nurse
and
doctress
bore
names
familiar
to
all
england
and
perhaps
did
i
ask
them
they
would
allow
me
to
publish
those
names
i
am
proud
to
think
that
a
gallant
sailor
on
whose
brave
breast
the
order
of
victoria
rests
a
more
gallant
man
can
never
wear
it
sent
for
the
doctress
whom
he
had
known
in
kingston
when
his
arm
wounded
on
the
fatal
of
june
refused
to
heal
and
i
think
that
the
application
i
recommended
did
it
good
but
i
shall
let
some
of
my
patients
letters
taken
from
a
large
bundle
speak
for
me
of
course
i
must
suppress
most
of
their
names

two

one
of
my
best
and
kindest
sons

you

it
was
a
capital
prescription
which

done
his
jaundice
good

so
great
a
demand
for

kept
it
mixed

a
large
pan

ladle

the
scores
of

came
for

with

in

from
february
to
this
time
this
excellent
woman
has
frequently
exerted
herself
in
the
most
praiseworthy
manner
in
attending
wounded
men
even
in
positions
of
great
danger
and
in
assisting
sick
soldiers
by
all
means
in
her
power
in
addition
she
kept
a
very
good
store
and
supplied
us
with
many
comforts
at
a
time
we
much
required
them

i
have
much
pleasure
in
stating
that
i
am
acquainted
with
seacole
and
from
all
that
i
have
seen
or
heard
of
her
i
believe
her
to
be
a
useful
and
good
person
kind
and
charitable

is
from
the
pen
of
one
who
at
that
time
was
more
looked
to
and
better
known
than
any
other
man
in
the
crimea
in
the
vol
of

from

is
the
following
entry
in
the
hour
of
their
illness
these
men
army
works

in
common
with
many
others
have
found
a
kind
and
successful
physician
close
to
the

formerly
of

other

as

wooden

here
she
doctors

of
men
with
extraordinary
success

is
always
in
attendance
near

aid
the
wounded

has
earned
many
a
poor
fellow
blessings
yes
i
can
not
referring
to
that
time
conscientiously
charge
myself
with
doing
less
for
the
men
who
had
only
thanks
to
give
me
than
for
the
officers
whose
gratitude
gave
me
the
necessaries
of
life
i
think
i
was
ever
ready
to
turn
from
the
latter
to
help
the
former
humble
as
they
might
be
and
they
were
grateful
in
their
way
and
as
far
as
they
could
be
they
would
buy
me
apples
and
other
fruit
at
balaclava
and
leave
them
at
my
store
one
made
me
promise
when
i
returned
home
to
send
word
to
his
irish
mother

was
to
send
me
a
cow
in
token
of
her
gratitude
for
the
help
i
had
been
to
her
son
i
have
a
book
filled
with
hundreds
of
the
names
of
those
who
came
to
me
for
medicines
and
other
aids
and
never
a
train
of
sick
or
wounded
men
from
the
front
passed
the
british
hotel
but
its
hostess
was
awaiting
them
to
offer
comforts
to
the
poor
fellows
for
whose
suffering
her
heart
bled
who
allowed
my
poor
name
to
appear
in
the
pages

had
welcomed

whimsical
mouthpiece
of
some
of
the
noblest
hearts
that
ever
beat
beneath
black
coats
shall
last
of
all
raise
its
voice
that
never
yet
pleaded
an
unworthy
cause
for
the
mother

that
takes
shame
to
herself
for
speaking
thus
of
the
poor
part
she
bore
of
the
trials
and
hardships
endured

dreary
when

can
say
what
i
have
been
all
anxiety
to
tell
you
from
its
beginning
please
look
back
to

see
how
hard
the

had
to
struggle
to
convey
herself
to

right
place
chapter
xiv
my
customers
at
the
british
hotel
i
shall
proceed
in
this
chapter
to
make
the
reader
acquainted
with
some
of
the
customers
of
the
british
hotel
who
came
there
for
its
creature
comforts
as
well
as
its
hostess
medicines
when
need
was
and
if
he
or
she
should
be
inclined
to
doubt
or
should
hesitate
at
accepting
my
experience
of
crimean
life
as
entirely
credible
i
beg
that
individual
to
refer
to
the
accounts
which
were
given
in
the
newspapers
of
the
spring
of
and
i
feel
sure
they
will
acquit
me
of
any
intention
to
exaggerate
if
i
were
to
speak
of
all
the
nameless
horrors
of
that
spring
as
plainly
as
i
could
i
should
really
disgust
you
but
those
i
shall
bring
before
your
notice
have
all
something
of
the
humorous
in
them
and
so
it
ever
is
time
is
a
great
restorer
and
changes
surely
the
greatest
sorrow
into
a
pleasing
memory
the
sun
shines
this
upon
green
grass
that
covers
the
graves
of
the
poor
fellows
we
left
behind
sadly
a
few
short
months
ago
bright
flowers
grow
up
upon
ruins
of
batteries
and
crumbling
trenches
and
cover
the
sod
that
presses
on
many
a
mouldering
token
of
the
old
time
of
battle
and
death
i
dare
say
that
if
i
went
to
the
crimea
now
i
should
see
a
smiling
landscape
instead
of
the
scene
which
i
shall
ever
associate
with
distress
and
death
and
as
it
is
with
nature
so
it
is
with
human
kind
whenever
i
meet
those
who
have
survived
that
dreary
spring
of
we
seldom
talk
about
its
horrors
but
remembering
its
transient
gleams
of
sunshine
smile
at
the
fun
and
good
nature
that
varied
its
long
and
weary
monotony
and
now
that
i
am
anxious
to
remember
all
i
can
that
will
interest
my
readers
my
memory
prefers
to
dwell
upon
what
was
pleasing
and
amusing
although
the
time
will
never
come
when
it
will
cease
to
retain
most
vividly
the
pathos
and
woe
of
those
dreadful
months
i
have
said
that
the
winter
had
not
ended
when
we
began
operations
at
the
british
hotel
and
very
often
after
we
considered
we
were
fairly
under
spring
influence
our
old
enemy
would
come
back
with
an
angry
roar
of
wind
and
rain
levelling
tents
unroofing
huts
destroying
roads
and
handing
over
may
to
the
command
of
general
fevrier
but
the
sun
fought
bravely
for
us
and
in
time
always
dispersed
the
leaden
clouds
and
gilded
the
iron
sky
and
made
us
cheerful
again
during
the
end
of
march
the
whole
of
april
and
a
considerable
portion
of
may
however
the
army
was
but
a
little
better
off
for
the
advent
of
spring
the
military
road
to
the
camp
was
only
in
progress
the
railway
only
carried
ammunition
a
few
hours
rain
rendered
the
old
road
all
but
impassable
and
scarcity
often
existed
in
the
front
before
sebastopol
although
the
frightened
and
anxious
commissariat
toiled
hard
to
avert
such
a
mishap
so
that
very
often
to
the
british
hotel
came
officers
starved
out
on
the
heights
above
us
the
dandies
of
rotten
row
would
come
down
riding
on
sorry
nags
ready
to
carry
back
their
servants
were
on
duty
in
the
trenches
anything
that
would
be
available
for
dinner
a
single
glance
at
their
personal
appearance
would
suffice
to
show
the
hardships
of
the
life
they
were
called
upon
to
lead
before
i
left
london
for
the
seat
of
war
i
had
been
more
than
once
to
the
united
service
club
seeking
to
gain
the
interest
of
officers
whom
i
had
known
in
jamaica
and
i
often
thought
afterwards
of
the
difference
between
those
i
saw
there
trimly
shaven
handsomely
dressed
with
spotless
linen
and
dandy
air
and
these
their
companions
who
in
england
would
resemble
them
roughly
warmly
dressed
with
great
fur
caps
which
met
their
beards
and
left
nothing
exposed
but
lips
and
nose
and
not
much
of
those
you
would
easily
believe
that
soap
and
water
were
luxuries
not
readily
obtainable
that
shirts
and
socks
were
often
comforts
to
dream
about
rather
than
possess
and
that
they
were
familiar
with
horrors
you
would
shudder
to
hear
named
tell
me
reader
can
you
fancy
what
the
want
of
so
simple
a
thing
as
a
is
to
put
a
case
have
you
ever
gone
out
for
the
day
without
one
sat
in
a
draught
and
caught
a
sneezing
cold
in
the
head
you
say
the
question
is
an
unnecessarily
unpleasant
one
and
yet
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
is
true
and
the
sufferer
is
i
believe
still
alive
an
officer
had
ridden
down
one
day
to
obtain
refreshments
this
was
very
early
in
the
spring
some
nice
fowls
had
just
been
taken
from
the
spit
and
i
offered
one
to
him
paper
was
one
of
the
most
hardly
obtainable
luxuries
of
the
crimea
and
i
rarely
had
any
to
waste
upon
my
customers
so
i
called
out
give
me
your
my
son
that
i
may
wrap
it
up
you
see
we
could
not
be
very
particular
out
there
but
he
smiled
very
bitterly
as
he
answered
mother
by
jove
i
wish
i
had
one
i
tore
my
last
shirt
into
shreds
a
fortnight
ago
and
there
not
a
bit
of
it
left
now
shortly
after
a
hundred
dozen
of
these
useful
articles
came
to
my
store
and
i
sold
them
all
to
officers
and
men
very
speedily
for
some
time
and
until
i
found
the
task
beyond
my
strength
i
kept
up
a
capital
table
at
the
british
hotel
but
at
last
i
gave
up
doing
so
professedly
and
my
hungry
customers
had
to
make
shift
with
whatever
was
on
the
premises
fortunately
they
were
not
and
had
few
antipathies
my
duties
increased
so
rapidly
that
sometimes
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
found
time
to
eat
and
sleep
could
i
have
obtained
good
servants
my
daily
labours
would
have
been
lightened
greatly
but
my
staff
never
consisted
of
more
than
a
few
boys
two
black
cooks
some
turks
one
of
whom
osman
had
enough
to
do
to
kill
and
pluck
the
poultry
while
the
others
looked
after
the
stock
and
killed
our
goats
and
sheep
and
as
many
runaway
sailors
or
in
search
of
employment
as
we
could
from
time
to
time
lay
our
hands
upon
but
they
never
found
my
larder
entirely
empty
i
often
used
to
roast
a
score
or
so
of
fowls
daily
besides
boiling
hams
and
tongues
either
these
or
a
slice
from
a
joint
of
beef
or
mutton
you
would
be
pretty
sure
of
finding
at
your
service
in
the
larder
of
the
british
hotel
would
you
like
gentle
reader
to
know
what
other
things
suggestive
of
home
and
its
comforts
your
relatives
and
friends
in
the
crimea
could
obtain
from
the
hostess
of
spring
hill
i
do
not
tell
you
that
the
following
articles
were
all
obtainable
at
the
commencement
but
many
were
the
time
was
indeed
when
had
you
asked
me
for
mock
turtle
and
venison
you
should
have
had
them
preserved
in
tins
but
that
was
when
the
crimea
was
flooded
with
plenty
too
late
alas
to
save
many
whom
want
had
killed
but
had
you
been
doing
your
best
to
batter
sebastopol
about
the
ears
of
the
russians
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
the
year
before
last
the
firm
of
seacole
and
day
would
have
been
happy
to
have
served
you
with
i
omit
ordinary
things
linen
and
hosiery
saddlery
caps
boots
and
shoes
for
the
outer
man
and
for
the
inner
man
meat
and
soups
of
every
variety
in
tins
you
can
scarcely
conceive
how
disgusted
we
all
became
at
last
with
preserved
provisions
salmon
lobsters
and
oysters
also
in
tins
which
last
beaten
up
into
fritters
with
onions
butter
eggs
pepper
and
salt
were
very
good
game
wild
fowl
vegetables
also
preserved
eggs
sardines
curry
powder
cigars
tobacco
snuff
cigarette
papers
tea
coffee
tooth
powder
and
currant
jelly
when
cargoes
came
in
from
constantinople
we
bought
great
supplies
of
potatoes
carrots
turnips
and
greens
ah
what
a
rush
there
used
to
be
for
the
greens
you
might
sometimes
get
hot
rolls
but
generally
speaking
i
bought
the
turkish
bread
baked
at
balaclava
or
had
you
felt
too
ill
to
partake
of
your
rough
camp
fare
coarsely
cooked
by
a
soldier
cook
who
unlike
the
french
could
turn
his
hand
to
few
things
but
fighting
and
had
ridden
down
that
muddy
road
to
the
col
to
see
what
mother
seacole
could
give
you
for
dinner
the
chances
were
you
would
have
found
a
good
joint
of
mutton
not
of
the
fattest
forsooth
for
in
such
miserable
condition
were
the
poor
beasts
landed
that
once
when
there
came
an
urgent
order
from
for
pounds
of
mutton
we
had
to
cut
up
one
sheep
and
a
half
to
provide
the
quantity
or
you
would
have
stumbled
upon
something
curried
or
upon
a
good
irish
stew
nice
and
hot
with
plenty
of
onions
and
potatoes
or
upon
some
capital
i
found
the
preserved
meats
were
better
relished
cooked
in
this
fashion
and
well
doctored
with
stimulants
before
long
i
grew
as
familiar
with
the
mysteries
of
seasoning
as
any
london
pieman
and
could
accommodate
myself
to
the
requirements
of
the
seasons
as
readily
or
had
there
been
nothing
better
you
might
have
gone
further
and
fared
on
worse
fare
than
one
of
my
welch
rabbits
for
the
manufacture
of
which
i
became
so
famous
and
had
you
been
fortunate
enough
to
have
visited
the
british
hotel
upon
day
i
warrant
you
would
have
ridden
back
to
your
hut
with
kind
thoughts
of
mother
endeavours
to
give
you
a
taste
of
home
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
be
proud
of
i
think
my
rice
puddings
made
without
milk
upon
the
high
road
to
sebastopol
would
have
gained
me
a
reputation
what
a
shout
there
used
to
be
when
i
came
out
of
my
little
caboose
hot
and
flurried
and
called
out
day
my
sons
some
of
them
were
baked
in
large
shallow
pans
for
the
men
and
the
sick
who
always
said
that
it
reminded
them
of
home
you
would
scarcely
expect
to
finish
up
your
dinner
with
pastry
but
very
often
you
would
have
found
a
good
stock
of
it
in
my
larder
whenever
i
had
a
few
leisure
moments
i
used
to
wash
my
hands
roll
up
my
sleeves
and
roll
out
pastry
very
often
i
was
interrupted
to
dispense
medicines
but
if
the
tarts
had
a
flavour
of
senna
or
the
puddings
tasted
of
rhubarb
it
never
interfered
with
their
consumption
i
declare
i
never
heard
or
read
of
an
army
so
partial
to
pastry
as
that
british
army
before
sebastopol
while
i
had
a
reputation
for
my
that
any
in
london
even
gunter
might
have
been
proud
of
the
officers
full
of
fun
and
high
spirits
used
to
crowd
into
the
little
kitchen
and
despite
all
my
remonstrances
which
were
not
always
confined
to
words
for
they
made
me
frantic
sometimes
and
an
iron
spoon
is
a
tempting
weapon
would
carry
off
the
tarts
hot
from
the
oven
while
the
black
cooks
instead
of
lending
me
their
aid
would
stand
by
and
laugh
with
all
their
teeth
and
when
the
hot
season
commenced
the
crowds
that
came
to
the
british
hotel
for
my
claret
and
cider
cups
and
other
cooling
summer
drinks
were
very
complimentary
in
their
expressions
of
appreciation
of
my
skill
now
supposing
that
you
had
made
a
hearty
dinner
and
were
thinking
of
starting
homeward
if
i
can
use
so
pleasant
a
term
in
reference
to
your
cheerless
quarters
it
was
very
natural
that
you
should
be
anxious
to
carry
back
something
to
your
hut
perhaps
you
expected
to
be
sent
into
the
trenches
many
a
supper
cooked
by
me
has
been
consumed
in
those
fearful
trenches
by
brave
men
who
could
eat
it
with
keen
appetites
while
the
messengers
of
death
were
speeding
around
them
or
perhaps
you
had
planned
a
little
and
wanted
to
give
your
friends
something
better
than
their
ordinary
fare
anyhow
you
would
in
all
probability
have
some
good
reason
for
returning
laden
with
comforts
and
necessaries
from
spring
hill
you
would
not
be
very
particular
about
carrying
them
you
might
have
been
a
great
swell
at
home
where
you
would
have
shuddered
if
bond
street
had
seen
you
carrying
a
parcel
no
larger
than
your
but
those
considerations
rarely
troubled
you
here
very
likely
your
servant
was
lying
crouched
in
a
rifle
pit
having
pots
at
the
russians
or
keeping
watch
and
ward
in
the
long
lines
of
trenches
or
stripped
to
his
shirt
shovelling
powder
and
shot
into
the
great
guns
whose
steady
roar
broke
the
evening
calm
so
if
you
did
not
wait
upon
yourself
you
would
stand
a
very
fair
chance
of
being
starved
but
you
would
open
your
knapsack
if
you
had
brought
one
for
me
to
fill
it
with
potatoes
and
halloo
out
never
mind
mother
although
the
gravy
from
the
fowls
on
your
saddle
before
you
was
soaking
through
the
little
modicum
of
paper
which
was
all
i
could
afford
you
so
laden
you
would
cheerfully
start
up
the
hill
of
mud
hutward
and
well
for
you
if
you
did
not
come
to
grief
on
that
treacherous
sea
of
mud
that
lay
swelling
between
the
col
and
your
destination
many
a
mishap
ludicrous
but
for
their
consequences
happened
on
it
i
remember
a
young
officer
coming
down
one
day
just
in
time
to
carry
off
my
last
fowl
and
meat
pie
before
he
had
gone
far
the
horse
so
floundered
in
the
mud
that
the
broke
and
while
the
pies
rolled
into
the
clayey
soil
in
one
direction
the
fowl
flew
in
another
to
make
matters
worse
the
horse
in
his
efforts
to
extricate
himself
did
for
them
entirely
and
in
terrible
distress
the
poor
fellow
came
back
for
me
to
set
him
up
again
i
shook
my
head
for
a
long
time
but
at
last
after
he
had
over
and
over
again
urged
upon
me
pathetically
that
he
had
two
fellows
coming
to
dine
with
him
at
six
and
nothing
in
the
world
in
his
hut
but
salt
pork
i
resigned
a
plump
fowl
which
i
had
kept
back
for
my
own
dinner
off
he
started
again
but
soon
came
back
with
oh
mother
i
forgot
all
about
the
potatoes
they
all
rolled
out
upon
that
road
you
must
fill
my
bag
again
we
all
laughed
heartily
at
him
but
this
state
of
things
been
rather
tragical
before
i
bring
this
chapter
to
a
close
i
should
like
with
the
reader
permission
to
describe
one
day
of
my
life
in
the
crimea
they
were
all
pretty
much
alike
except
when
there
was
fighting
upon
a
large
scale
going
on
and
duty
called
me
to
the
field
i
was
generally
up
and
busy
by
daybreak
sometimes
earlier
for
in
the
summer
my
bed
had
no
attractions
strong
enough
to
bind
me
to
it
after
four
there
was
plenty
to
do
before
the
work
of
the
day
began
there
was
the
poultry
to
pluck
and
prepare
for
cooking
which
had
been
killed
on
the
previous
night
the
joints
to
be
cut
up
and
got
ready
for
the
same
purpose
the
medicines
to
be
mixed
the
store
to
be
swept
and
cleaned
of
very
great
importance
with
all
these
things
to
see
after
were
the
few
hours
of
quiet
before
the
road
became
alive
with
travellers
by
seven
the
morning
coffee
would
be
ready
hot
and
refreshing
and
eagerly
sought
for
by
the
officers
of
the
army
works
corps
engaged
upon
making
the
great
to
the
front
and
the
commissariat
and
land
transport
men
carrying
stores
from
balaclava
to
the
heights
there
was
always
a
great
demand
for
coffee
by
those
who
knew
its
refreshing
and
strengthening
qualities
milk
i
could
not
give
them
i
kept
it
in
tins
for
special
use
but
they
had
it
hot
and
strong
with
plenty
of
sugar
and
a
slice
of
butter
which
i
recommend
as
a
capital
substitute
for
milk
from
that
time
until
nine
officers
on
duty
in
the
neighbourhood
or
passing
by
would
look
in
for
breakfast
and
about
nine
my
sick
patients
began
to
show
themselves
in
the
following
hour
they
came
thickly
and
sometimes
it
was
past
twelve
before
i
had
got
through
this
duty
they
came
with
every
variety
of
suffering
and
disease
the
cases
i
most
disliked
were
the
frostbitten
fingers
and
feet
in
the
winter
that
over
there
was
the
hospital
to
visit
across
the
way
which
was
sometimes
overcrowded
with
patients
i
was
a
good
deal
there
and
as
often
as
possible
would
take
over
books
and
papers
which
i
used
to
borrow
for
that
purpose
from
my
friends
and
the
officers
i
knew
once
a
great
packet
of
tracts
was
sent
to
me
from
plymouth
anonymously
and
these
i
distributed
in
the
same
manner
by
this
time
the
day
news
had
come
from
the
front
and
perhaps
among
the
casualties
over
night
there
would
be
some
one
wounded
or
sick
who
would
be
glad
to
see
me
ride
up
with
the
comforts
he
stood
most
in
need
of
and
during
the
day
if
any
accident
occurred
in
the
neighbourhood
or
on
the
road
near
the
british
hotel
the
men
generally
brought
the
sufferer
there
whence
if
the
hurt
was
serious
he
would
be
transferred
to
the
hospital
of
the
land
transport
opposite
i
used
not
always
to
stand
upon
too
much
ceremony
when
i
heard
of
sick
or
wounded
officers
in
the
front
sometimes
their
friends
would
ask
me
to
go
to
them
though
very
often
i
waited
for
no
hint
but
took
the
chance
of
meeting
with
a
kind
reception
i
used
to
think
of
their
relatives
at
home
who
would
have
given
so
much
to
possess
my
privilege
and
more
than
one
officer
have
i
startled
by
appearing
before
him
and
telling
him
abruptly
that
he
must
have
a
mother
wife
or
sister
at
home
whom
he
missed
and
that
he
must
therefore
be
glad
of
some
woman
to
take
their
place
until
evening
the
store
would
be
filled
with
customers
wanting
stores
dinners
and
luncheons
loungers
and
idlers
seeking
conversation
and
amusement
and
at
eight
the
curtain
descended
on
that
day
labour
and
i
could
sit
down
and
eat
at
leisure
it
was
no
easy
thing
to
clear
the
store
canteen
and
yards
but
we
determined
upon
adhering
to
the
rule
that
nothing
should
be
sold
after
that
hour
and
succeeded
any
one
who
came
after
that
time
came
simply
as
a
friend
there
could
be
no
necessity
for
any
one
except
on
extraordinary
occasions
when
the
rule
could
be
relaxed
to
purchase
things
after
eight
and
drunkenness
or
excess
were
discouraged
at
spring
hill
in
every
way
indeed
my
few
unpleasant
scenes
arose
chiefly
from
my
refusing
to
sell
liquor
where
i
saw
it
was
wanted
to
be
abused
i
could
appeal
with
a
clear
conscience
to
all
who
knew
me
there
to
back
my
assertion
that
i
neither
permitted
drunkenness
among
the
men
nor
gambling
among
the
officers
whatever
happened
elsewhere
intoxication
cards
and
dice
were
never
to
be
seen
within
the
precincts
of
the
british
hotel
my
regulations
were
well
known
and
a
officer
of
the
royals
who
was
much
there
and
who
permitted
me
to
use
a
familiarity
towards
him
which
i
trust
i
never
abused
undertook
to
be
my
but
his
duties
were
very
light
at
first
we
kept
our
store
open
on
sunday
from
sheer
necessity
but
after
a
little
while
when
stores
in
abundance
were
established
at
kadikoi
and
elsewhere
and
the
absolute
necessity
no
longer
existed
sunday
became
a
day
of
most
grateful
rest
at
spring
hill
this
step
also
met
with
opposition
from
the
men
but
again
we
were
determined
and
again
we
triumphed
i
am
sure
we
needed
rest
i
have
often
wondered
since
how
it
was
that
i
never
fell
ill
or
came
home
on
urgent
private
affairs
i
am
afraid
that
i
was
not
sufficiently
thankful
to
the
providence
which
gave
me
strength
to
carry
out
the
work
i
loved
so
well
and
felt
so
happy
in
being
engaged
upon
but
although
i
never
had
a
week
illness
during
my
campaign
the
labour
anxiety
and
perhaps
the
few
trials
that
followed
it
have
told
upon
me
i
have
never
felt
since
that
time
the
strong
and
hearty
woman
that
i
was
when
i
braved
with
impunity
the
pestilence
of
navy
bay
and
cruces
it
would
kill
me
easily
now
chapter
xv
my
first
glimpse
of
war
advance
of
my
turkish
friends
on
kamara
visitors
to
the
camp
miss
nightingale
mons
soyer
and
the
cholera
summer
in
the
crimea
thirsty
souls
death
busy
in
the
trenches
in
the
last
three
chapters
i
have
attempted
without
any
consideration
of
dates
to
give
my
readers
some
idea
of
my
life
in
the
crimea
i
am
fully
aware
that
i
have
jumbled
up
events
strangely
talking
in
the
same
page
and
even
sentence
of
events
which
occurred
at
different
times
but
i
have
three
excuses
to
offer
for
my
unhistorical
inexactness
in
the
first
place
my
memory
is
far
from
trustworthy
and
i
kept
no
written
diary
in
the
second
place
the
reader
must
have
had
more
than
enough
of
journals
and
chronicles
of
crimean
life
and
i
am
only
the
historian
of
spring
hill
and
in
the
third
place
unless
i
am
allowed
to
tell
the
story
of
my
life
in
my
own
way
i
can
not
tell
it
at
all
i
shall
now
endeavour
to
describe
my
life
as
much
as
possible
and
write
of
those
great
events
in
the
field
of
which
i
was
a
humble
witness
but
i
shall
continue
to
speak
from
my
own
experience
simply
and
if
the
reader
should
be
surprised
at
my
leaving
any
memorable
action
of
the
army
unnoticed
he
may
be
sure
that
it
is
because
i
was
mixing
medicines
or
making
good
things
in
the
kitchen
of
the
british
hotel
and
first
heard
the
particulars
of
it
perhaps
from
the
newspapers
which
came
from
home
my
readers
must
know
too
that
they
were
much
more
familiar
with
the
history
of
the
camp
at
their
own
firesides
than
we
who
lived
in
it
just
as
a
spectator
seeing
one
of
the
battles
from
a
hill
as
i
did
the
tchernaya
knows
more
about
it
than
the
combatant
in
the
valley
below
who
only
thinks
of
the
enemy
whom
it
is
his
immediate
duty
to
repel
so
you
through
the
valuable
aid
of
the
cleverest
man
in
the
whole
camp
read
in
the
columns
the
details
of
that
great
campaign
while
we
the
actors
in
it
had
enough
to
do
to
discharge
our
own
duties
well
and
rarely
concerned
ourselves
in
what
seemed
of
such
importance
to
you
and
so
very
often
a
desperate
skirmish
or
action
the
news
of
which
created
so
much
sensation
in
england
was
but
little
regarded
at
spring
hill
my
first
experience
of
battle
was
pleasant
enough
before
we
had
been
long
at
spring
hill
omar
pasha
got
something
for
his
turks
to
do
and
one
fine
morning
they
were
marched
away
towards
the
russian
outposts
on
the
road
to
baidar
i
accompanied
them
on
horseback
and
enjoyed
the
sight
amazingly
english
and
french
cavalry
preceded
the
turkish
infantry
over
the
plain
yet
full
of
memorials
of
the
terrible
light
cavalry
charge
a
few
months
before
and
while
one
detachment
of
the
turks
made
a
reconnaissance
to
the
right
of
the
tchernaya
another
pushed
their
way
up
the
hill
towards
kamara
driving
in
the
russian
outposts
after
what
seemed
but
a
slight
resistance
it
was
very
pretty
to
see
them
advance
and
to
watch
how
every
now
and
then
little
clouds
of
white
smoke
puffed
up
from
behind
bushes
and
the
crests
of
hills
and
were
answered
by
similar
puffs
from
the
long
line
of
busy
skirmishers
that
preceded
the
main
body
this
was
my
first
experience
of
actual
battle
and
i
felt
that
strange
excitement
which
i
do
not
remember
on
future
occasions
coupled
with
an
earnest
longing
to
see
more
of
warfare
and
to
share
in
its
hazards
it
was
not
long
before
my
wish
was
gratified
i
do
not
know
much
of
the
second
bombardment
of
sebastopol
in
the
month
of
april
although
i
was
as
assiduous
as
i
could
be
in
my
attendance
at
cathcart
hill
i
could
judge
of
its
severity
by
the
long
trains
of
wounded
which
passed
the
british
hotel
i
had
a
stretcher
laid
near
the
door
and
very
often
a
poor
fellow
was
laid
upon
it
outwearied
by
the
terrible
conveyance
from
the
front
after
this
unsuccessful
bombardment
it
seemed
to
us
that
there
was
a
sudden
lull
in
the
progress
of
the
siege
and
other
things
began
to
interest
us
there
were
several
arrivals
to
talk
over
miss
nightingale
came
to
supervise
the
balaclava
hospitals
and
before
long
she
had
practical
experience
of
crimean
fever
after
her
came
the
duke
of
newcastle
and
the
great
high
priest
of
the
mysteries
of
cookery
mons
alexis
soyer
he
was
often
at
spring
hill
with
the
most
smiling
of
faces
and
in
the
most
gorgeous
of
irregular
uniforms
and
never
failed
to
praise
my
soups
and
dainties
i
always
flattered
myself
that
i
was
his
match
and
with
our
west
indian
dishes
could
of
course
beat
him
hollow
and
more
than
once
i
challenged
him
to
a
trial
of
skill
but
the
gallant
frenchman
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
disclaimed
my
challenge
with
many
flourishes
of
his
jewelled
hands
declaring
that
madame
proposed
a
contest
where
victory
would
cost
him
his
reputation
for
gallantry
and
be
more
disastrous
than
defeat
and
all
because
i
was
a
woman
forsooth
what
nonsense
to
talk
like
that
when
i
was
doing
the
work
of
half
a
dozen
men
then
he
would
laugh
and
declare
that
when
our
campaigns
were
over
we
would
render
rivalry
impossible
by
combining
to
open
the
first
restaurant
in
europe
there
was
always
fun
in
the
store
when
the
frenchman
was
there
one
dark
tempestuous
night
i
was
knocked
up
by
the
arrival
of
other
visitors
these
were
the
first
regiment
of
sardinian
grenadiers
who
benighted
on
their
way
to
the
position
assigned
them
remained
at
spring
hill
until
the
morning
we
soon
turned
out
our
staff
and
lighted
up
the
store
and
entertained
the
officers
as
well
as
we
could
inside
while
the
soldiers
bivouacked
in
the
yards
around
not
a
single
thing
was
stolen
or
disturbed
that
night
although
they
had
many
opportunities
we
all
admired
and
liked
the
sardinians
they
were
honest
fellows
and
i
wish
there
had
been
no
worse
men
or
soldiers
in
the
crimea
as
the
season
advanced
many
visitors
came
to
the
crimea
from
all
parts
of
the
world
and
many
of
them
were
glad
to
make
spring
hill
their
we
should
have
been
better
off
if
some
of
them
had
spared
us
this
compliment
a
captain
clair
for
instance
who
could
doubt
any
one
with
such
a
name
stayed
some
time
with
us
had
the
best
of
everything
and
paid
us
most
honourably
with
one
bill
upon
his
agents
while
we
cashed
another
to
provide
him
with
money
for
his
homeward
route
he
was
an
accomplished
fellow
and
i
really
liked
him
but
unfortunately
for
us
he
was
a
swindler
i
saw
much
of
another
visitor
to
the
camp
in
the
crimea
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
with
whom
i
had
had
many
a
hard
bout
in
past
times
the
cholera
there
were
many
cases
in
the
hospital
of
the
land
transport
corps
opposite
and
i
prescribed
for
many
others
personally
the
raki
sold
in
too
many
of
the
stores
in
balaclava
and
kadikoi
was
most
pernicious
and
although
the
authorities
forbade
the
sutlers
to
sell
it
under
heavy
penalties
it
found
its
way
into
the
camp
in
large
quantities
during
may
and
while
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
third
great
bombardment
of
the
city
summer
broke
beautifully
and
the
weather
chequered
occasionally
by
fitful
intervals
of
cold
and
rain
made
us
all
cheerful
you
would
scarcely
have
believed
that
the
happy
and
jocular
visitors
to
the
british
hotel
were
the
same
men
who
had
a
few
weeks
before
ridden
gloomily
through
the
muddy
road
to
its
door
it
was
a
period
of
relaxation
and
they
all
enjoyed
it
amusement
was
the
order
of
the
day
races
and
were
eagerly
indulged
in
and
in
all
i
could
be
of
use
to
provide
the
good
cheer
which
was
so
essential
a
part
of
these
entertainments
and
when
the
warm
weather
came
in
all
its
intensity
and
i
took
to
manufacturing
cooling
beverages
for
my
friends
and
customers
my
store
was
always
full
to
please
all
was
somewhat
difficult
and
occasionally
some
of
them
were
scarcely
so
polite
as
they
should
have
been
to
a
perplexed
hostess
who
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
remember
that
lieutenant
had
bespoken
his
sangaree
an
instant
before
captain
and
his
friends
had
ordered
their
claret
cup
in
anticipation
of
the
hot
weather
i
had
laid
in
a
large
stock
of
raspberry
vinegar
which
properly
managed
helps
to
make
a
pleasant
drink
and
there
was
a
great
demand
for
sangaree
claret
and
cider
cups
the
cups
being
battered
pewter
pots
would
you
like
reader
to
know
my
recipe
for
the
favourite
claret
cup
it
is
simple
enough
claret
water
sugar
nutmeg
and
ice
yes
ice
but
not
often
and
not
for
long
for
the
eager
officers
soon
made
an
end
of
it
sometimes
there
were
at
spring
hill
but
of
these
more
hereafter
at
one
of
the
earliest
when
the
correspondent
was
to
be
present
i
rode
down
to
kadikoi
bought
some
calico
and
cut
it
up
into
table
napkins
they
all
laughed
very
heartily
and
thought
perhaps
of
a
few
weeks
previously
when
every
available
piece
of
linen
in
the
camp
would
have
been
snapped
up
for
but
the
reader
must
not
forget
that
all
this
time
although
there
might
be
only
a
few
short
and
sullen
roars
of
the
great
guns
by
day
few
nights
passed
without
some
fighting
in
the
trenches
and
very
often
the
news
of
the
morning
would
be
that
one
or
other
of
those
i
knew
had
fallen
these
tidings
often
saddened
me
and
when
i
awoke
in
the
night
and
heard
the
thunder
of
the
guns
fiercer
than
usual
i
have
quite
dreaded
the
dawn
which
might
usher
in
bad
news
the
deaths
in
the
trenches
touched
me
deeply
perhaps
for
this
reason
it
was
very
usual
when
a
young
officer
was
ordered
into
the
trenches
for
him
to
ride
down
to
spring
hill
to
dine
or
obtain
something
more
than
his
ordinary
fare
to
brighten
his
weary
hours
in
those
fearful
ditches
they
seldom
failed
on
these
occasions
to
shake
me
by
the
hand
at
parting
and
sometimes
would
say
you
see
seacole
i
say
to
the
dear
ones
at
home
so
i
bid
you
for
them
perhaps
you
see
them
some
day
and
if
the
russians
should
knock
me
over
mother
just
tell
them
i
thought
of
them
all
will
you
and
although
all
this
might
be
said
in
a
manner
it
was
rather
solemn
i
felt
it
to
be
so
for
i
never
failed
although
who
was
i
that
i
should
preach
to
say
something
about
providence
and
relying
upon
it
and
they
were
very
good
no
army
of
parsons
could
be
much
better
than
my
sons
they
would
listen
very
gravely
and
shake
me
by
the
hand
again
while
i
felt
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
i
would
not
do
for
them
then
very
often
the
men
would
say
i
going
in
with
my
master
seacole
come
and
look
after
him
if
he
hit
and
so
often
as
this
happened
i
would
pass
the
night
restlessly
awaiting
with
anxiety
the
morning
and
yet
dreading
to
hear
the
news
it
held
in
store
for
me
i
used
to
think
it
was
like
having
a
large
family
of
children
ill
with
fever
and
dreading
to
hear
which
one
had
passed
away
in
the
night
and
as
often
as
the
bad
news
came
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
ride
up
to
the
hut
of
the
sufferer
and
do
my
woman
work
but
i
felt
it
deeply
how
could
it
be
otherwise
there
was
one
poor
boy
in
the
artillery
with
blue
eyes
and
light
golden
hair
whom
i
nursed
through
a
long
and
weary
sickness
borne
with
all
a
man
spirit
and
whom
i
grew
to
love
like
a
fond
mother
i
thought
if
ever
angels
watched
over
any
life
they
would
shelter
his
but
one
day
but
a
short
time
after
he
had
left
his
he
was
struck
down
on
his
battery
working
like
a
young
hero
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
could
banish
from
my
mind
the
thought
of
him
as
i
saw
him
last
the
yellow
hair
stiff
and
stained
with
his
and
the
blue
eyes
closed
in
the
sleep
of
death
of
course
i
saw
him
buried
as
i
did
poor
h
v
my
old
jamaica
friend
whose
kind
face
was
so
familiar
to
me
of
old
another
good
friend
i
mourned
bitterly
captain
b
of
the
coldstreams
a
great
cricketer
he
had
been
with
me
on
the
previous
evening
had
seemed
dull
but
had
supped
at
my
store
and
on
the
following
morning
a
brother
officer
told
me
he
was
shot
dead
while
setting
his
pickets
which
made
me
ill
and
unfit
for
work
for
the
whole
day
mind
you
a
day
was
a
long
time
to
give
to
sorrow
in
the
crimea
i
could
give
many
other
similar
instances
but
why
should
i
sadden
myself
or
my
readers
others
have
described
the
horrors
of
those
fatal
trenches
but
their
real
history
has
never
been
written
and
perhaps
it
is
as
well
that
so
harrowing
a
tale
should
be
left
in
oblivion
such
anecdotes
as
the
following
were
very
current
in
the
camp
but
i
have
no
means
of
answering
for
its
truth
two
sergeants
met
in
the
trenches
who
had
been
schoolmates
in
their
youth
years
had
passed
since
they
set
out
for
the
battle
of
life
by
different
roads
and
now
they
met
again
under
the
fire
of
a
common
enemy
with
one
impulse
they
started
forward
to
exchange
the
hearty
and
the
mutual
greetings
and
while
their
hands
were
still
clasped
a
chance
shot
killed
both
chapter

the

tchernaya
work
on
the
field
my
patients
before
i
left
the
crimea
to
return
to
england
the
of
the
british
army
gave
me
a
testimonial
which
the
reader
has
already
read
in
chapter
in
which
he
stated
that
i
had
frequently
exerted
myself
in
the
most
praiseworthy
manner
in
attending
wounded
men
even
in
positions
of
great
danger
the
simple
meaning
of
this
sentence
is
that
in
the
discharge
of
what
i
conceived
to
be
my
duty
i
was
frequently
under
fire
now
i
am
far
from
wishing
to
speak
of
this
fact
with
any
vanity
or
pride
because
after
all
one
soon
gets
accustomed
to
it
and
it
fails
at
last
to
create
more
than
temporary
uneasiness
indeed
after
sebastopol
was
ours
you
might
often
see
officers
and
men
strolling
coolly
even
leisurely
across
and
along
those
streets
exposed
to
the
enemy
fire
when
a
little
haste
would
have
carried
them
beyond
the
reach
of
danger
the
truth
was
i
believe
they
had
grown
so
habituated
to
being
in
peril
from
shot
or
shell
that
they
rather
liked
the
sensation
and
found
it
difficult
to
get
on
without
a
little
gratuitous
excitement
and
danger
but
putting
aside
the
great
engagements
where
i
underwent
considerable
peril
one
could
scarcely
move
about
the
various
camps
without
some
risk
the
russians
had
it
seemed
sunk
great
ships
guns
into
the
earth
from
which
they
fired
shot
and
shell
at
a
very
long
range
which
came
tumbling
and
plunging
between
and
sometimes
into
the
huts
and
tents
in
a
very
unwieldy
and
generally
harmless
fashion
once
when
i
was
riding
through
the
camp
of
the
rifles
a
round
shot
came
plunging
towards
me
and
before
i
or
the
horse
had
time
to
be
much
frightened
the
ugly
fellow
buried
itself
in
the
earth
with
a
heavy
thud
a
little
distance
in
front
of
us
in
the
first
week
of
june
the
third
bombardment
of
sebastopol
opened
and
the
spring
hill
visitors
had
plenty
to
talk
about
many
were
the
surmises
as
to
when
the
assault
would
take
place
of
the
success
of
which
nobody
entertained
a
doubt
somehow
or
other
important
secrets
oozed
out
in
various
parts
of
the
camp
which
the
russians
would
have
given
much
to
know
and
one
of
these
places
was
the
british
hotel
some
such
whispers
were
afloat
on
the
evening
of
sunday
the
of
june
and
excited
me
strangely
any
stranger
not
in
my
secret
would
have
considered
that
my
conduct
fully
justified
my
partner
day
in
sending
me
home
as
better
fitted
for
a
cell
in
bedlam
than
the
charge
of
an
hotel
in
the
crimea
i
never
remember
feeling
more
excited
or
more
restless
than
upon
that
day
and
no
sooner
had
night
fairly
closed
in
upon
us
than
instead
of
making
preparations
for
bed
this
same
stranger
would
have
seen
me
wrap
up
the
nights
were
still
cold
and
start
off
for
a
long
walk
to
cathcart
hill
three
miles
and
a
half
away
i
stayed
there
until
past
midnight
but
when
i
returned
home
there
was
no
rest
for
me
for
i
had
found
out
that
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
many
regiments
were
marching
down
to
the
trenches
and
that
the
dawn
of
day
would
be
the
signal
that
should
let
them
loose
upon
the
russians
the
few
hours
still
left
before
daybreak
were
made
the
most
of
at
spring
hill
we
were
all
busily
occupied
in
cutting
bread
and
cheese
and
sandwiches
packing
up
fowls
tongues
and
ham
wine
and
spirits
while
i
carefully
filled
the
large
bag
which
i
always
carried
into
the
field
slung
across
my
shoulder
with
lint
bandages
needles
thread
and
medicines
and
soon
after
daybreak
everything
was
ready
packed
upon
two
mules
in
charge
of
my
steadiest
lad
and
i
leading
the
way
on
horseback
the
little
cavalcade
left
the
british
hotel
before
the
sun
of
the
fatal
of
june
had
been
many
hours
old
it
was
not
long
before
our
progress
was
arrested
by
the
cavalry
pickets
closely
stationed
to
stop
all
stragglers
and
spectators
from
reaching
the
scene
of
action
but
after
a
blight
parley
and
when
they
found
out
who
i
was
and
how
i
was
prepared
for
the
day
work
the
men
raised
a
shout
for
me
and
with
their
officer
sanction
allowed
me
to
pass
so
i
reached
cathcart
hill
crowded
with
and
leaving
there
the
mules
loaded
myself
with
what
provisions
i
could
carry
and
it
was
a
work
of
no
little
difficulty
and
danger
succeeded
in
reaching
the
reserves
of
sir
henry
division
which
was
to
have
stormed
something
i
forget
what
but
when
they
found
the
attack
upon
the
redan
was
a
failure
very
wisely
abstained
here
i
found
plenty
of
officers
who
soon
relieved
me
of
my
refreshments
and
some
wounded
men
who
found
the
contents
of
my
bag
very
useful
at
length
i
made
my
way
to
the
woronzoff
road
where
the
temporary
hospital
had
been
erected
and
there
i
found
the
doctors
hard
enough
at
work
and
hastened
to
help
them
as
best
i
could
i
bound
up
the
wounds
and
ministered
to
the
wants
of
a
good
many
and
stayed
there
some
considerable
time
upon
the
way
and
even
here
i
was
under
fire
more
frequently
than
was
agreeable
a
shot
would
come
ploughing
up
the
ground
and
raising
clouds
of
dust
or
a
shell
whizz
above
us
upon
these
occasions
those
around
would
cry
out
lie
down
mother
lie
down
and
with
very
undignified
and
unladylike
haste
i
had
to
embrace
the
earth
and
remain
there
until
the
same
voices
would
laughingly
assure
me
that
the
danger
was
over
or
one
more
thoughtful
than
the
rest
would
come
to
give
me
a
helping
hand
and
hope
that
the
old
lady
was
neither
hit
nor
frightened
several
times
in
my
wanderings
on
that
eventful
day
of
which
i
confess
to
have
a
most
confused
remembrance
only
knowing
that
i
looked
after
many
wounded
men
i
was
ordered
back
but
each
time
my
bag
of
bandages
and
comforts
for
the
wounded
proved
my
passport
while
at
the
hospital
i
was
chiefly
of
use
looking
after
those
who
either
from
lack
of
hands
or
because
their
hurts
were
less
serious
had
to
wait
pained
and
weary
until
the
doctors
who
however
more
like
murderers
could
attend
to
them
and
the
grateful
words
and
smile
which
rewarded
me
for
binding
up
a
wound
or
giving
cooling
drink
was
a
pleasure
worth
risking
life
for
at
any
time
it
was
here
that
i
received
my
only
wound
during
the
campaign
i
threw
myself
too
hastily
on
the
ground
in
obedience
to
the
command
of
those
around
me
to
escape
a
threatening
shell
and
fell
heavily
on
the
thumb
of
my
right
hand
dislocating
it
it
was
bound
up
on
the
spot
and
did
not
inconvenience
me
much
but
it
has
never
returned
to
its
proper
shape
after
this
first
washing
my
hands
in
some
sherry
from
lack
of
water
i
went
back
to
cathcart
hill
where
i
found
my
horse
and
heard
that
the
lad
either
frightened
or
tired
of
waiting
had
gone
away
with
the
mules
i
had
to
ride
three
miles
after
him
and
then
the
only
satisfaction
i
had
arose
from
laying
my
about
his
shoulders
after
that
working
my
way
round
how
i
can
scarcely
tell
i
got
to
the
extreme
left
attack
where
general
eyre
division
had
been
hotly
engaged
all
day
and
had
suffered
severely
i
left
my
horse
in
charge
of
some
men
and
with
no
little
difficulty
and
at
no
little
risk
crept
down
to
where
some
wounded
men
lay
with
whom
i
left
refreshments
and
then
it
was
growing
late
i
started
for
spring
hill
where
i
heard
all
about
the
events
of
the
luckless
day
from
those
who
had
seen
them
from
posts
of
safety
while
i
who
had
been
in
the
midst
of
it
all
day
knew
so
little
on
the
following
day
some
irishmen
of
the
royals
brought
me
in
token
of
my
having
been
among
them
a
russian
woman
dress
and
a
poor
pigeon
which
they
had
brought
away
from
one
of
the
houses
in
the
suburb
where
their
regiment
suffered
so
severely
but
that
evening
of
the
of
june
was
a
sad
one
and
the
news
that
came
in
of
those
that
had
fallen
were
most
heartrending
both
the
leaders
who
fell
so
gloriously
before
the
redan
had
been
very
good
to
the
mistress
of
spring
hill
but
a
few
days
before
the
y
had
merrily
declared
that
i
should
have
a
silver
salver
to
hand
about
things
upon
instead
of
the
poor
shabby
one
i
had
been
reduced
to
while
sir
john
c
had
been
my
kind
patron
for
some
years
it
was
in
my
house
in
jamaica
that
lady
c
had
once
lodged
when
her
husband
was
stationed
in
that
island
and
when
the
recall
home
came
lady
c
who
had
she
been
like
most
women
would
have
shrunk
from
any
exertion
declared
that
she
was
a
soldier
wife
and
would
accompany
him
fortunately
the
blenheim
was
detained
in
the
roads
a
few
days
after
the
time
expected
for
her
departure
and
i
put
into
its
father
arms
a
little
scotchman
born
within
sight
of
the
blue
hills
of
jamaica
and
yet
with
these
at
home
the
brave
general
as
i
read
in
the
a
few
weeks
later
displayed
a
courage
amounting
to
rashness
and
sending
away
his
rushed
on
to
a
certain
death
on
the
following
day
directly
i
heard
of
the
armistice
i
hastened
to
the
scene
of
action
anxious
to
see
once
more
the
faces
of
those
who
had
been
so
kind
to
me
in
life
that
was
a
fearful
sight
for
a
woman
to
witness
and
if
i
do
not
pray
god
that
i
may
never
see
its
like
again
it
is
because
i
wish
to
be
useful
all
my
life
and
it
is
in
scenes
of
horror
and
distress
that
a
woman
can
do
so
much
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
not
i
think
until
four
that
the
russians
brought
over
the
bodies
of
the
two
leaders
of
assault
they
had
stripped
sir
john
of
epaulettes
sword
and
boots
ah
how
my
heart
felt
for
those
at
home
who
would
so
soon
hear
of
this
day
fatal
work
it
was
on
the
following
day
i
think
that
i
saw
them
bury
him
near
cathcart
hill
where
his
tent
had
been
pitched
if
i
had
been
in
the
least
humour
for
what
was
ludicrous
the
looks
and
curiosity
of
the
russians
who
saw
me
during
the
armistice
would
have
afforded
me
considerable
amusement
i
wonder
what
rank
they
assigned
me
how
true
it
is
as
somebody
has
said
that
misfortunes
never
come
singly
pleasures
often
do
for
while
we
were
dull
enough
at
this
great
trouble
we
had
cholera
raging
around
us
carrying
off
its
victims
of
all
ranks
there
was
great
distress
in
the
sardinian
camp
on
this
account
and
i
soon
lost
another
good
customer
general
e
carried
off
by
the
same
terrible
plague
before
e
left
the
crimea
she
sent
several
useful
things
kept
back
from
the
sale
of
the
general
effects
at
this
sale
i
wanted
to
buy
a
useful
waggon
but
did
not
like
to
bid
against
lord
w
who
purchased
it
but
i
tell
this
anecdote
to
show
how
kind
they
all
were
to
me
when
his
lordship
heard
of
this
he
sent
it
over
to
spring
hill
with
a
message
that
it
was
mine
for
a
far
lower
price
than
he
had
given
for
it
and
since
my
return
home
i
have
had
to
thank
the
same
nobleman
for
still
greater
favours
but
who
indeed
has
not
been
kind
to
me
within
a
week
after
general
e
death
a
still
greater
calamity
happened
lord
raglan
died
that
great
soldier
who
had
such
iron
courage
with
the
gentle
smile
and
kind
word
that
always
show
the
good
man
i
was
familiar
enough
with
his
person
for
although
people
did
not
know
it
in
england
he
was
continually
in
the
saddle
looking
after
his
suffering
men
and
scheming
plans
for
their
benefit
and
the
humblest
soldier
will
remember
that
let
who
might
look
stern
and
distant
the
first
man
in
the
british
army
ever
had
a
kind
word
to
give
him
during
the
time
he
was
ill
i
was
at
several
times
and
once
his
servants
allowed
me
to
peep
into
the
room
where
their
master
lay
i
do
not
think
they
knew
that
he
was
dying
but
they
seemed
very
sad
and
low
far
more
so
than
he
for
whom
they
feared
and
on
the
day
of
his
funeral
i
was
there
again
i
never
saw
such
heartfelt
gloom
as
that
which
brooded
on
the
faces
of
his
attendants
but
it
was
good
to
hear
how
they
all
even
the
humblest
had
some
kind
memory
of
the
great
general
whom
providence
had
called
from
his
post
at
such
a
season
of
danger
and
distress
and
once
again
they
let
me
into
the
room
in
which
the
coffin
lay
and
i
timidly
stretched
out
my
hand
and
touched
a
corner
of
the
which
lay
upon
it
and
then
i
watched
it
wind
its
way
through
the
long
lines
of
soldiery
towards
kamiesch
while
ever
and
anon
the
guns
thundered
forth
in
sorrow
not
in
anger
and
for
days
after
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
caradoc
which
was
ploughing
its
way
through
the
sunny
sea
with
its
sad
burden
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
the
british
army
to
remain
long
dull
and
before
very
long
we
went
on
gaily
as
ever
forgetting
the
terrible
of
june
or
only
remembering
it
to
look
forward
to
the
next
assault
compensating
for
all
and
once
more
the
british
hotel
was
filled
with
a
busy
throng
and
laughter
and
fun
through
its
iron
rafters
nothing
of
consequence
was
done
in
the
front
for
weeks
possibly
because
russell
was
taking
holiday
and
would
not
return
until
august
about
this
time
the
stores
of
the
british
hotel
were
well
filled
not
only
with
every
conceivable
necessary
of
life
but
with
many
of
its
most
expensive
luxuries
it
was
at
this
period
that
you
could
have
asked
for
few
things
that
i
could
not
have
supplied
you
with
on
the
spot
or
obtained
for
you
if
you
had
a
little
patience
and
did
not
mind
a
few
weeks
delay
not
only
spring
hill
and
kadikoi
which
a
poor
place
enough
when
we
came
had
grown
into
a
town
of
stores
and
had
its
market
regulations
and
police
but
the
whole
camp
shared
in
this
unusual
plenty
even
the
men
could
afford
to
despise
salt
meat
and
pork
and
fed
as
well
if
not
better
than
if
they
had
been
in
quarters
at
home
and
there
were
and
places
of
amusement
opened
at
balaclava
and
balls
given
in
some
of
them
which
raised
my
temper
to
an
unwonted
pitch
because
i
foresaw
the
dangers
which
they
had
for
the
young
and
impulsive
and
sure
enough
they
cost
several
officers
their
commissions
right
glad
was
i
one
day
when
the
great
purifier
fire
burnt
down
the
worst
of
these
places
and
ruined
its
owner
a
bad
frenchwoman
and
the
railway
was
in
full
work
and
the
great
road
nearly
finished
and
the
old
one
passable
and
the
mules
and
horses
looked
in
such
fair
condition
that
you
would
scarcely
have
believed
farrier
c
of
the
land
transport
corps
who
would
have
told
you
then
and
will
tell
you
now
that
he
superintended
on
one
bleak
morning
of
february
not
six
months
agone
the
task
of
throwing
the
corpses
of
one
hundred
and
eight
mules
over
the
cliffs
at
karanyi
into
the
black
sea
beneath
of
course
the
summer
introduced
its
own
plagues
and
among
the
worst
of
these
were
the
flies
i
shall
never
forget
those
crimean
flies
and
most
sincerely
hope
that
like
the
patagonians
they
are
only
to
be
found
in
one
part
of
the
world
nature
must
surely
have
intended
them
for
blackbeetles
and
accidentally
given
them
wings
there
was
no
exterminating
them
no
thinning
them
no
escaping
from
them
by
night
or
by
day
one
of
my
boys
confined
himself
almost
entirely
to
laying
baits
and
traps
for
their
destruction
and
used
to
boast
that
he
destroyed
them
at
the
rate
of
a
gallon
a
day
but
i
never
noticed
any
perceptible
decrease
in
their
powers
of
mischief
and
annoyance
the
officers
in
the
front
suffered
terribly
from
them
one
of
my
kindest
customers
a
lieutenant
serving
in
the
royal
naval
brigade
who
was
a
close
relative
of
the
queen
whose
uniform
he
wore
came
to
me
in
great
perplexity
he
evidently
considered
the
fly
nuisance
the
most
trying
portion
of
the
campaign
and
of
far
more
consequence
than
the
russian
shot
and
shell
mami
he
said
he
had
been
in
the
west
indies
and
so
called
me
by
the
familiar
term
used
by
the
creole
children
mami
these
flies
respect
nothing
not
content
with
eating
my
prog
they
set
to
at
night
and
make
a
supper
of
me
and
his
face
showed
traces
of
their
attacks
confound
them
they
kill
me
mami
they
everywhere
even
in
the
trenches
and
you
suppose
they
would
care
to
go
there
from
choice
what
can
you
do
for
me
mami
not
much
but
i
rode
down
to
b
store
at
kadikoi
where
i
was
lucky
in
being
able
to
procure
a
piece
of
muslin
which
i
pinned
up
time
was
too
precious
to
allow
me
to
use
needle
and
thread
into
a
mosquito
net
with
which
the
prince
was
delighted
he
fell
ill
later
in
the
summer
when
i
went
up
to
his
quarters
and
did
all
i
could
for
him
as
the
summer
wore
on
busily
passed
by
all
of
us
at
the
british
hotel
rumours
stronger
than
ever
were
heard
of
a
great
battle
soon
to
be
fought
by
the
reinforcements
which
were
known
to
have
joined
the
russian
army
and
i
think
that
no
one
was
much
surprised
when
one
pleasant
august
morning
at
early
dawn
heavy
firing
was
heard
towards
the
french
position
on
the
right
by
the
tchernaya
and
the
stream
of
troops
and
poured
from
all
quarters
in
that
direction
prepared
and
loaded
as
usual
i
was
soon
riding
in
the
same
direction
and
saw
the
chief
part
of
the
morning
battle
i
saw
the
russians
cross
and
recross
the
river
i
saw
their
officers
cheer
and
wave
them
on
in
the
coolest
bravest
manner
until
they
were
shot
down
by
scores
i
was
near
enough
to
hear
at
times
in
the
lull
of
artillery
and
above
the
rattle
of
the
musketry
the
excited
cheers
which
told
of
a
daring
attack
or
a
successful
repulse
and
beneath
where
i
stood
i
could
see
what
the
russians
could
not
steadily
drawn
up
quiet
and
expectant
the
squadrons
of
english
and
french
cavalry
calmly
yet
impatiently
waiting
until
the
russians
partial
success
should
bring
their
sabres
into
play
but
the
contingency
never
happened
and
we
saw
the
russians
fall
slowly
back
in
good
order
while
the
sardinians
and
french
spread
out
in
pursuit
and
formed
a
picture
so
excitingly
beautiful
that
we
forgot
the
suffering
and
death
they
left
behind
and
then
i
descended
with
the
rest
into
the
field
of
battle
it
was
a
fearful
scene
but
why
repeat
this
remark
all
death
is
trying
to
witness
even
that
of
the
good
man
who
lays
down
his
life
hopefully
and
peacefully
but
on
the
when
the
poor
body
is
torn
and
rent
in
hideous
ways
and
the
scared
spirit
struggles
to
loose
itself
from
the
still
strong
frame
that
holds
it
tightly
to
the
last
death
is
fearful
indeed
it
had
come
peacefully
enough
to
some
they
lay
with
eyes
and
a
quiet
smile
about
the
lips
that
showed
their
end
to
have
been
painless
others
it
had
arrested
in
the
heat
of
passion
and
frozen
on
their
pallid
faces
a
glare
of
hatred
and
defiance
that
made
your
warm
blood
run
cold
but
little
time
had
we
to
think
of
the
dead
whose
business
it
was
to
see
after
the
dying
who
might
yet
be
saved
the
ground
was
thickly
cumbered
with
the
wounded
some
of
them
calm
and
resigned
others
impatient
and
restless
a
few
filling
the
air
with
their
cries
of
pain
all
wanting
water
and
grateful
to
those
who
administered
it
and
more
substantial
comforts
you
might
see
officers
and
strangers
visitors
to
the
camp
riding
about
the
field
on
this
errand
of
mercy
and
this
although
surely
it
could
not
have
been
intentional
russian
guns
still
played
upon
the
scene
of
action
there
were
many
others
there
bent
on
a
more
selfish
task
the
plunderers
were
busy
everywhere
it
was
marvellous
to
see
how
eagerly
the
french
stripped
the
dead
of
what
was
valuable
not
always
in
their
brutal
work
paying
much
regard
to
the
presence
of
a
lady
some
of
the
officers
when
i
complained
rather
angrily
laughed
and
said
it
was
spoiling
the
egyptians
but
i
think
the
israelites
spared
their
enemies
those
garments
which
perhaps
were
not
so
unmentionable
in
those
days
as
they
have
since
become
i
attended
to
the
wounds
of
many
french
and
sardinians
and
helped
to
lift
them
into
the
ambulances
which
came
tearing
up
to
the
scene
of
action
i
derived
no
little
gratification
from
being
able
to
dress
the
wounds
of
several
russians
indeed
they
were
as
kindly
treated
as
the
others
one
of
them
was
badly
shot
in
the
lower
jaw
and
was
beyond
my
or
any
human
skill
incautiously
i
inserted
my
finger
into
his
mouth
to
feel
where
the
ball
had
lodged
and
his
teeth
closed
upon
it
in
the
agonies
of
death
so
tightly
that
i
had
to
call
to
those
around
to
release
it
which
was
not
done
until
it
had
been
bitten
so
deeply
that
i
shall
carry
the
scar
with
me
to
my
grave
poor
fellow
he
meant
me
no
harm
for
as
the
near
approach
of
death
softened
his
features
a
smile
spread
over
his
rough
inexpressive
face
and
so
he
died
i
attended
another
russian
a
handsome
fellow
and
an
officer
shot
in
the
side
who
bore
his
cruel
suffering
with
a
firmness
that
was
very
noble
in
return
for
the
little
use
i
was
to
him
he
took
a
ring
off
his
finger
and
gave
it
to
me
and
after
i
had
helped
to
lift
him
into
the
ambulance
he
kissed
my
hand
and
smiled
far
more
thanks
than
i
had
earned
i
do
not
know
whether
he
survived
his
wounds
but
i
fear
not
many
others
on
that
day
gave
me
thanks
in
words
the
meaning
of
which
was
lost
upon
me
and
all
of
them
in
that
one
common
language
of
the
whole
world
smiles
i
carried
two
patients
off
the
field
one
a
french
officer
wounded
on
the
hip
who
chose
to
go
back
to
spring
hill
and
be
attended
by
me
there
and
who
on
leaving
told
us
that
he
was
a
relative
of
the
marshal
pelissier
the
other
a
poor
cossack
colt
i
found
running
round
its
dam
which
lay
beside
its
cossack
master
dead
with
its
tongue
hanging
from
its
mouth
the
colt
was
already
wounded
in
the
ears
and
and
i
was
only
just
in
time
to
prevent
a
french
corporal
who
perhaps
for
pity
sake
was
preparing
to
give
it
de
i
saved
the
poor
thing
by
promising
to
give
the
frenchman
ten
shillings
if
he
would
bring
it
down
to
the
british
hotel
which
he
did
that
same
evening
i
attended
to
its
hurts
and
succeeded
in
rearing
it
and
it
became
a
great
pet
at
spring
hill
and
accompanied
me
to
england
i
picked
up
some
trophies
from
the
but
not
many
and
those
of
little
value
i
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
plundering
either
the
living
or
the
dead
but
i
picked
up
a
russian
metal
cross
and
took
from
the
bodies
of
some
of
the
poor
fellows
nothing
of
more
value
than
a
few
buttons
which
i
severed
from
their
coarse
grey
coats
so
end
my
reminiscences
of
the
battle
of
the
tchernaya
fought
as
all
the
world
knows
on
the
of
august
chapter
xvii
inside
sebastopol
the
last
bombardment
of
sebastopol
on
cathcart
hill
rumours
in
the
camp
the
attack
on
the
malakhoff
the
old
work
again
a
sunday
excursion
inside
our
city
i
am
taken
for
a
spy
and
thereat
lose
my
temper
i
visit
the
redan
my
share
of
the
plunder
the
three
weeks
following
the
battle
of
the
tchernaya
were
i
should
think
some
of
the
busiest
and
most
eventful
the
world
has
ever
seen
there
was
little
doing
at
spring
hill
every
one
was
either
at
his
post
or
too
anxiously
awaiting
the
issue
of
the
last
great
bombardment
to
spend
much
time
at
the
british
hotel
i
think
that
i
lost
more
of
my
patients
and
customers
during
those
few
weeks
than
during
the
whole
previous
progress
of
the
siege
scarce
a
night
passed
that
i
was
not
lulled
to
sleep
with
the
heavy
continuous
roar
of
the
artillery
scarce
a
morning
dawned
that
the
same
sound
did
not
usher
in
my
day
work
the
ear
grew
so
accustomed
during
those
weeks
to
the
terrible
roar
that
when
sebastopol
fell
the
sudden
quiet
seemed
unnatural
and
made
us
dull
and
during
the
whole
of
this
time
the
most
perplexing
rumours
flew
about
some
having
reference
to
the
day
of
assault
the
majority
relative
to
the
last
great
effort
which
it
was
supposed
the
russians
would
make
to
drive
us
into
the
sea
i
confess
these
latter
rumours
now
and
then
caused
me
temporary
uneasiness
spring
hill
being
on
the
direct
line
of
route
which
the
actors
in
such
a
tragedy
must
take
i
spent
much
of
my
time
on
cathcart
hill
watching
with
a
curiosity
and
excitement
which
became
intense
the
progress
of
the
terrible
bombardment
now
and
then
a
shell
would
fall
among
the
crowd
of
which
covered
the
hill
but
it
never
disturbed
us
so
keen
and
feverish
and
so
deadened
to
danger
had
the
excitement
and
expectation
made
us
in
the
midst
of
the
bombardment
took
place
the
important
ceremony
of
distributing
the
order
of
the
bath
to
those
selected
for
that
honour
i
contrived
to
witness
this
ceremony
very
pleasantly
and
although
it
cost
me
a
day
i
considered
that
i
had
fairly
earned
the
pleasure
i
was
anxious
to
have
some
personal
share
in
the
affair
so
i
made
and
forwarded
to
a
cake
which
gunter
might
have
been
at
some
loss
to
manufacture
with
the
materials
at
my
command
and
which
i
adorned
gaily
with
banners
flags
etc
i
received
great
kindness
from
the
officials
at
the
ceremony
and
from
the
officers
some
of
rank
who
recognised
me
indeed
i
held
quite
a
little
around
my
chair
well
a
few
days
after
this
ceremony
i
thought
the
end
of
the
world
instead
of
the
war
was
at
hand
when
every
battery
opened
and
poured
a
perfect
hail
of
shot
and
shell
upon
the
beautiful
city
which
i
had
left
the
night
before
sleeping
so
calm
and
peaceful
beneath
the
stars
the
firing
began
at
early
dawn
and
was
fearful
sleep
was
impossible
so
i
arose
and
set
out
for
my
old
station
on
cathcart
hill
and
here
with
refreshments
for
the
anxious
i
spent
most
of
my
time
right
glad
of
any
excuse
to
witness
the
last
scene
of
the
siege
it
was
from
this
spot
that
i
saw
fire
after
fire
break
out
in
sebastopol
and
watched
all
night
the
beautiful
yet
terrible
effect
of
a
great
ship
blazing
in
the
harbour
and
lighting
up
the
adjoining
country
for
miles
the
weather
changed
as
it
often
did
in
the
crimea
most
capriciously
and
the
morning
of
the
memorable
of
september
broke
cold
and
wintry
the
same
little
bird
which
had
let
me
into
so
many
secrets
also
gave
me
a
hint
of
what
this
day
was
pregnant
with
and
very
early
in
the
morning
i
was
on
horseback
with
my
bandages
and
refreshments
ready
to
repeat
the
work
of
the
of
june
last
a
line
of
sentries
forbade
all
strangers
passing
through
without
orders
even
to
cathcart
hill
but
once
more
i
found
that
my
reputation
served
as
a
permit
and
the
officers
relaxed
the
rule
in
my
favour
everywhere
so
early
in
the
day
i
was
in
my
old
spot
with
my
old
appliances
for
the
wounded
and
fatigued
little
expecting
however
that
this
day
would
so
closely
resemble
the
day
of
the
last
attack
in
its
disastrous
results
it
was
noon
before
the
cannonading
suddenly
ceased
and
we
saw
with
a
strange
feeling
of
excitement
the
french
tumble
out
of
their
advanced
trenches
and
roll
into
the
malakhoff
like
a
human
flood
onward
they
seemed
to
go
into
the
dust
and
smoke
swallowed
up
by
hundreds
but
they
never
returned
and
before
long
we
saw
workmen
levelling
parapets
and
filling
up
ditches
over
which
they
drove
with
headlong
speed
and
impetuosity
artillery
and
until
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
malakhoff
was
taken
although
the
tide
of
battle
still
surged
around
it
with
violence
and
wounded
men
were
borne
from
it
in
large
numbers
and
before
this
our
men
had
made
their
attack
and
the
fearful
assault
of
the
redan
was
going
on
and
failing
but
i
was
soon
too
busy
to
see
much
for
the
wounded
were
borne
in
even
in
greater
numbers
than
at
the
last
assault
whilst
stragglers
slightly
hurt
limped
in
in
numbers
and
engrossed
our
attention
i
now
and
then
found
time
to
ask
them
rapid
questions
but
they
did
not
appear
to
know
anything
more
than
that
everything
had
gone
wrong
the
sailors
as
before
showed
their
gallantry
and
even
recklessness
conspicuously
the
wounded
of
the
ladder
and
sandbag
parties
came
up
even
with
a
laugh
and
joked
about
their
hurts
in
the
happiest
conceivable
manner
i
saw
many
officers
of
the
wounded
and
as
far
as
possible
i
reserved
my
attentions
for
my
old
regiment
known
so
well
in
my
native
island
my
poor
their
loss
was
terrible
i
dressed
the
wound
of
one
of
its
officers
seriously
hit
in
the
mouth
i
attended
to
another
wounded
in
the
throat
and
bandaged
the
hand
of
a
third
terribly
crushed
by
a
in
the
midst
of
this
we
were
often
interrupted
by
those
unwelcome
and
impartial
russian
visitors
the
shells
one
fell
so
near
that
i
thought
my
last
hour
was
come
and
although
i
had
sufficient
firmness
to
throw
myself
upon
the
ground
i
was
so
seriously
frightened
that
i
never
thought
of
rising
from
my
recumbent
position
until
the
hearty
laugh
of
those
around
convinced
me
that
the
danger
had
passed
by
afterwards
i
picked
up
a
piece
of
this
huge
shell
and
brought
it
home
with
me
it
was
on
this
as
on
every
similar
occasion
that
i
saw
the
correspondent
eagerly
taking
down
notes
and
sketches
of
the
scene
under
fire
listening
apparently
with
attention
to
all
the
busy
little
crowd
that
surrounded
him
but
without
laying
down
his
pencil
and
yet
finding
time
even
in
his
busiest
moment
to
lend
a
helping
hand
to
the
wounded
it
may
have
been
on
this
occasion
that
his
keen
eye
noticed
me
and
his
mind
albeit
engrossed
with
far
more
important
memories
found
room
to
remember
me
i
may
well
be
proud
of
his
testimony
borne
so
generously
only
the
other
day
and
may
well
be
excused
for
transcribing
it
from
the
columns
of
the
i
have
seen
her
go
down
under
fire
with
her
little
store
of
creature
comforts
for
our
wounded
men
and
a
more
tender
or
skilful
hand
about
a
wound
or
broken
limb
could
not
be
found
among
our
best
surgeons
i
saw
her
at
the
assault
on
the
redan
at
the
tchernaya
at
the
fall
of
sebastopol
laden
not
with
plunder
good
old
soul
but
with
wine
bandages
and
food
for
the
wounded
or
the
prisoners
i
remained
on
cathcart
hill
far
into
the
night
and
watched
the
city
blazing
beneath
us
at
the
terrible
sight
until
the
bitter
wind
found
its
way
through
my
thin
clothing
and
chilled
me
to
the
bone
and
not
till
then
did
i
leave
for
spring
hill
i
had
little
sleep
that
night
the
night
was
made
a
ruddy
lurid
day
with
the
glare
of
the
blazing
town
while
every
now
and
then
came
reports
which
shook
the
earth
to
its
centre
and
yet
i
believe
very
many
of
the
soldiers
wearied
with
their
day
labour
slept
soundly
throughout
that
terrible
night
and
awoke
to
find
their
work
completed
for
in
the
night
covered
by
the
burning
city
sebastopol
was
left
a
heap
of
ruins
to
its
victors
and
before
noon
on
the
following
day
none
but
dead
and
dying
russians
were
in
the
south
side
of
the
once
famous
and
beautiful
of
the
euxine
the
good
news
soon
spread
through
the
camp
it
gave
great
pleasure
but
i
almost
think
the
soldiers
would
have
been
better
pleased
had
the
russians
delayed
their
parting
twelve
hours
longer
and
given
the
highlanders
and
their
comrades
a
chance
of
retrieving
the
disasters
of
the
previous
day
nothing
else
could
wipe
away
the
soreness
of
defeat
or
compensate
for
the
better
fortune
which
had
befallen
our
allies
the
french
the
news
of
the
evacuation
of
sebastopol
soon
carried
away
all
traces
of
yesterday
fatigue
for
weeks
past
i
had
been
offering
bets
to
every
one
that
i
would
not
only
be
the
first
woman
to
enter
sebastopol
from
the
english
lines
but
that
i
would
be
the
first
to
carry
refreshments
into
the
fallen
city
and
now
the
time
i
had
longed
for
had
come
i
borrowed
some
mules
from
the
land
transport
corps
mine
were
knocked
up
by
yesterday
work
and
loading
them
with
good
things
started
off
with
my
partner
and
some
other
friends
early
on
that
memorable
sunday
morning
for
cathcart
hill
when
i
found
that
strict
orders
had
been
given
to
admit
no
one
inside
sebastopol
i
became
quite
excited
and
making
my
way
to
general
garrett
quarters
i
made
such
an
earnest
representation
of
what
i
considered
my
right
that
i
soon
obtained
a
pass
of
which
the
following
is
a
copy
pass
seacole
and
her
attendants
with
refreshments
for
officers
and
soldiers
in
the
redan
and
in
sebastopol
garrett
cathcart
hill
so
many
attached
themselves
to
my
staff
becoming
for
the
nonce
my
attendants
that
i
had
some
difficulty
at
starting
but
at
last
i
passed
all
the
sentries
safely
much
to
the
annoyance
of
many
officers
who
were
trying
every
conceivable
scheme
to
evade
them
and
entered
the
city
i
can
give
you
no
very
clear
description
of
its
condition
on
that
sunday
morning
a
year
and
a
half
ago
many
parts
of
it
were
still
blazing
furiously
explosions
were
taking
place
in
all
directions
every
step
had
a
score
of
dangers
and
yet
curiosity
and
excitement
carried
us
on
and
on
i
was
often
stopped
to
give
refreshments
to
officers
and
men
who
had
been
fasting
for
hours
some
on
the
other
hand
had
found
their
way
to
russian
cellars
and
one
body
of
men
were
most
ingloriously
drunk
and
playing
the
wildest
pranks
they
were
dancing
yelling
and
singing
some
of
them
with
russian
women
dresses
fastened
round
their
waists
and
old
bonnets
stuck
upon
their
heads
i
was
offered
many
trophies
all
plunder
was
stopped
by
the
sentries
and
confiscated
so
that
the
soldiers
could
afford
to
be
liberal
by
one
i
was
offered
a
great
velvet
sofa
another
pressed
a
huge
which
had
graced
some
sebastopol
study
upon
me
while
a
third
begged
my
acceptance
of
a
portion
of
a
grand
piano
what
i
did
carry
away
was
very
unimportant
a
studded
with
gold
and
silver
stars
which
the
present
condescended
to
accept
as
a
sebastopol
memorial
an
old
cracked
china
teapot
which
in
happier
times
had
very
likely
dispensed
pleasure
to
many
a
small
a
cracked
bell
which
had
rung
many
to
prayers
during
the
siege
and
which
i
bore
away
on
my
saddle
and
a
parasol
given
me
by
a
drunken
soldier
he
had
a
silk
skirt
on
and
torn
lace
upon
his
wrists
and
he
came
mincingly
up
holding
the
parasol
above
his
head
and
imitating
the
walk
of
an
affected
lady
to
the
vociferous
delight
of
his
comrades
and
all
this
and
much
more
in
that
fearful
charnel
city
with
death
and
suffering
on
every
side
it
was
very
hazardous
to
pass
along
some
of
the
streets
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
russians
on
the
north
side
of
the
harbour
we
had
to
wait
and
watch
our
opportunity
and
then
gallop
for
it
some
of
us
had
close
shaves
of
being
hit
more
than
this
fires
still
kept
breaking
out
around
while
mines
and
fougasses
not
unfrequently
exploded
from
unknown
causes
we
saw
two
officers
emerge
from
a
heap
of
ruins
covered
and
almost
blinded
with
smoke
and
dust
from
some
such
explosion
with
considerable
difficulty
we
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
quarter
of
the
town
held
by
the
french
where
i
was
nearly
getting
into
serious
trouble
i
had
loitered
somewhat
behind
my
party
watching
with
pardonable
curiosity
the
adroitness
with
which
a
party
of
french
were
plundering
a
house
and
by
the
time
my
curiosity
had
been
satisfied
i
found
myself
quite
alone
my
retinue
having
preceded
me
by
some
few
hundred
yards
this
would
have
been
of
little
consequence
had
not
an
american
sailor
lad
actuated
either
by
mischief
or
folly
whispered
to
the
frenchmen
that
i
was
a
russian
spy
and
had
they
not
instead
of
laughing
at
him
credited
his
assertion
and
proceeded
to
arrest
me
now
such
a
charge
was
enough
to
make
a
lion
of
a
lamb
so
i
refused
positively
to
dismount
and
made
matters
worse
by
knocking
in
the
cap
of
the
first
soldier
who
laid
hands
upon
me
with
the
bell
that
hung
at
my
saddle
upon
this
six
or
seven
tried
to
force
me
to
the
in
rather
a
rough
manner
while
i
resisted
with
all
my
force
screaming
out
for
day
and
using
the
bell
for
a
weapon
how
i
longed
for
a
better
one
i
need
not
tell
the
reader
in
the
midst
of
this
scene
came
up
a
french
officer
whom
i
recognised
as
the
patient
i
had
taken
to
spring
hill
after
the
battle
of
the
tchernaya
and
who
took
my
part
at
once
and
ordered
them
to
release
me
although
i
rather
weakened
my
cause
it
was
most
natural
that
directly
i
was
released
i
should
fly
at
the
varlet
who
had
caused
me
this
trouble
and
i
did
so
using
my
bell
most
effectually
and
aided
when
my
party
returned
by
their
this
little
adventure
took
up
altogether
so
much
time
that
when
the
french
soldiers
had
made
their
apologies
to
me
and
i
had
returned
the
compliment
to
the
one
whose
head
had
been
dented
by
my
bell
it
was
growing
late
and
we
made
our
way
back
to
cathcart
hill
on
the
way
a
little
french
soldier
begged
hard
of
me
to
buy
a
picture
which
had
been
cut
from
above
the
altar
of
some
church
in
sebastopol
it
was
too
dark
to
see
much
of
his
prize
but
i
ultimately
became
its
possessor
and
brought
it
home
with
me
it
is
some
eight
or
ten
feet
in
length
and
represents
i
should
think
the
madonna
i
am
no
judge
of
such
things
but
i
think
although
the
painting
is
rather
coarse
that
the
face
of
the
virgin
and
the
heads
of
cherubim
that
fill
the
cloud
from
which
she
is
descending
are
soft
and
beautiful
there
is
a
look
of
divine
calmness
and
heavenly
love
in
the
madonna
face
which
is
very
striking
and
perhaps
during
the
long
and
awful
siege
many
a
knee
was
bent
in
worship
before
it
and
many
a
heart
found
comfort
in
its
soft
loving
gaze
on
the
following
day
i
again
entered
sebastopol
and
saw
still
more
of
its
horrors
but
i
have
refrained
from
describing
so
many
scenes
of
woe
that
i
am
loth
to
dwell
much
on
these
the
very
recollection
of
that
woeful
hospital
where
thousands
of
dead
and
dying
had
been
left
by
the
retreating
russians
is
enough
to
unnerve
the
strongest
and
sicken
the
most
experienced
i
would
give
much
if
i
had
never
seen
that
harrowing
sight
i
believe
some
englishmen
were
found
in
it
alive
but
it
was
as
well
that
they
did
not
live
to
tell
their
fearful
experience
i
made
my
way
into
the
redan
also
although
every
step
was
dangerous
and
took
from
it
some
brown
bread
which
seemed
to
have
been
left
in
the
oven
by
the
baker
when
he
fled
before
many
days
were
passed
some
frenchwomen
opened
houses
in
sebastopol
but
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
held
by
the
english
the
prospect
was
not
sufficiently
tempting
for
me
to
follow
their
example
and
so
i
saw
out
the
remainder
of
the
campaign
from
my
old
quarters
at
spring

chapter

new

day
in
the
hospital
well
the
great
work
was
accomplished
sebastopol
was
taken
the
russians
had
retired
sullenly
to
their
stronghold
on
the
north
side
of
the
harbour
from
which
every
now
and
then
they
sent
a
few
vain
shot
and
shell
which
sent
the
amateurs
in
the
streets
of
sebastopol
scampering
but
gave
the
experienced
no
concern
in
a
few
days
the
camp
could
find
plenty
to
talk
about
in
their
novel
position
and
what
then
what
was
to
be
done
more
fighting
another
equally
terrible
and
lengthy
siege
of
the
north
that
was
the
business
of
a
few
at
and
in
council
at
home
between
whom
the
electric
wires
flashed
many
a
message
in
the
meanwhile
the
real
workers
applied
themselves
to
plan
amusements
and
the
same
energy
and
activity
which
had
made
sebastopol
a
heap
of
ruins
and
a
cemetery
which
had
dug
the
miles
of
trenches
and
held
them
when
made
against
a
desperate
foe
which
had
manned
the
many
guns
and
worked
them
so
well
set
to
work
as
eager
to
kill
their
present
enemy
time
as
they
had
lately
been
to
destroy
their
fled
enemies
the
russians
all
who
were
before
sebastopol
will
long
remember
the
beautiful
autumn
which
succeeded
to
so
eventful
a
summer
and
ushered
in
so
pleasantly
the
second
winter
of
the
campaign
it
was
appreciated
as
only
those
who
earn
the
right
to
enjoyment
can
enjoy
relaxation
the
camp
was
full
of
visitors
of
every
rank
they
thronged
the
streets
of
sebastopol
sketching
its
ruins
and
setting
up
photographic
apparatus
in
contemptuous
indifference
of
the
shot
with
which
the
russians
generally
favoured
every
conspicuous
group
pleasure
was
hunted
keenly
cricket
matches
dinner
parties
races
theatricals
all
found
their
admirers
my
restaurant
was
always
full
and
once
more
merry
laughter
was
heard
and
many
a
dinner
party
was
held
beneath
the
iron
roof
of
the
british
hotel
several
were
given
in
compliment
to
our
allies
and
many
distinguished
frenchmen
have
tested
my
powers
of
cooking
you
might
have
seen
at
one
party
some
of
their
most
famous
officers
at
once
were
present
a
prince
of
the
imperial
family
of
france
the
duc
de
rouchefoucault
and
a
certain
corporal
in
the
french
service
who
was
perhaps
the
best
known
man
in
the
whole
army
the
viscount
talon
they
expressed
themselves
highly
gratified
at
the
and
perhaps
were
not
a
little
surprised
as
course
after
course
made
its
appearance
and
to
soup
and
fish
succeeded
turkeys
saddle
of
mutton
fowls
ham
tongue
curry
pastry
of
many
sorts
custards
jelly
and
olives
i
took
a
peculiar
pride
in
doing
my
best
when
they
were
present
for
i
knew
a
little
of
the
secrets
of
the
french
commissariat
i
wonder
if
the
world
will
ever
know
more
i
wonder
if
the
system
of
secresy
which
has
so
long
kept
veiled
the
sufferings
of
the
french
army
before
sebastopol
will
ever
yield
to
truth
i
used
to
guess
something
of
those
sufferings
when
i
saw
even
after
the
fall
of
sebastopol
french
soldiers
prowling
about
my
store
taking
eagerly
even
what
the
turks
rejected
as
unfit
for
human
food
and
no
one
could
accuse
of
squeamishness
i
can
not
but
believe
that
in
some
desks
or
bureaux
lie
notes
or
diaries
which
shall
one
day
be
given
to
the
world
and
when
this
happens
the
terrible
distresses
of
the
english
army
will
pall
before
the
sufferings
of
the
french
it
is
true
that
they
carried
from
sebastopol
the
lion
share
of
glory
my
belief
is
that
they
deserved
it
having
borne
by
far
a
larger
proportion
of
suffering
there
were
few
dinners
at
spring
hill
at
which
the
guests
did
not
show
their
appreciation
of
their
hostess
labour
by
drinking
her
health
and
at
the
dinner
i
have
above
alluded
to
the
toast
was
responded
to
with
such
enthusiasm
that
i
felt
compelled
to
put
my
acknowledgments
into
the
form
of
a
little
speech
which
talon
interpreted
to
his
countrymen
the
french
prince
was
after
this
occasion
several
times
at
the
british
hotel
he
was
there
once
when
some
americans
were
received
by
me
with
scarcely
that
cordiality
which
i
have
been
told
distinguished
my
reception
of
guests
and
upon
their
leaving
i
told
him
quite
forgetting
his
own
connection
with
america
of
my
prejudice
against
the
yankees
he
heard
me
for
a
little
while
and
then
he
interrupted
me
tenez
madame
seacole
i
too
am
american
a
little
what
a
pity
i
was
not
born
a
countess
i
am
sure
i
should
have
made
a
capital
courtier
witness
my
impromptu
answer
i
should
never
have
guessed
it
prince
and
he
seemed
amused
with
the
theatricals
directly
i
had
nothing
to
do
had
i
been
a
little
younger
the
companies
would
very
likely
have
been
glad
of
me
for
no
one
liked
to
sacrifice
their
beards
to
become
miss
julia
or
plain
mary
ann
and
even
the
beardless
subalterns
had
voices
which
no
coaxing
could
soften
down
but
i
lent
them
plenty
of
dresses
indeed
it
was
the
only
airing
which
a
great
many
muslins
had
in
the
crimea
how
was
i
to
know
when
i
brought
them
what
was
and
in
addition
to
this
i
found
it
necessary
to
convert
my
kitchen
into
a
temporary
where
to
the
wonderment
and
perhaps
scandal
of
the
black
cook
the
ladies
of
the
company
of
the
royals
were
taught
to
manage
their
petticoats
with
becoming
grace
and
neither
to
show
their
awkward
booted
ankles
nor
trip
themselves
up
over
their
trains
it
was
a
difficult
task
in
many
respects
although
i
laced
them
in
until
they
grew
blue
in
the
face
their
waists
were
a
disgrace
to
the
sex
while
crinoline
being
unknown
then
my
struggles
to
give
them
becoming
may
be
imagined
it
was
not
until
a
year
later
that
thought
of
using
a
and
i
would
have
given
much
for
such
a
hint
when
i
was
dresser
to
the
theatrical
company
of
the
royals
the
hair
was
another
difficulty
to
be
sure
there
was
plenty
in
the
camp
only
it
was
in
the
wrong
place
and
many
an
application
was
made
to
me
for
a
set
of
curls
however
i
am
happy
to
say
i
am
not
become
a
customer
of
the
wigmakers
yet
my
recollections
of
hunting
in
the
crimea
are
confined
to
seeing
troops
of
horsemen
sweep
by
with
shouts
and
yells
after
some
wretched
dog
once
i
was
very
nearly
frightened
out
of
my
wits
my
first
impression
being
that
the
russians
had
carried
into
effect
their
old
threat
of
driving
us
into
the
sea
by
the
startling
appearance
of
a
large
body
of
horsemen
tearing
down
the
hill
after
apparently
nothing
however
i
discovered
in
good
time
that
in
default
of
vermin
they
were
chasing
a
brother
officer
with
a
paper
bag
my
experience
of
crimean
races
are
perfect
for
i
was
present
in
the
character
of
cantiniere
at
all
the
more
important
meetings
some
of
them
took
place
before
christmas
and
some
after
but
i
shall
exhaust
the
subject
at
once
i
had
no
little
difficulty
to
get
the
things
on
to
the
course
and
in
particular
after
i
had
sat
up
the
whole
night
making
preparations
for
the
december
races
at
the
monastery
of
george
i
could
not
get
my
poor
mules
over
the
rough
country
and
found
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
day
some
miles
from
the
course
at
last
i
gave
it
up
as
hopeless
and
dismounting
sat
down
by
the
roadside
to
consider
how
i
could
possibly
dispose
of
the
piles
of
sandwiches
bread
cheese
pies
and
tarts
which
had
been
prepared
for
the
hungry
spectators
at
last
some
officers
who
expected
me
long
before
came
to
look
after
me
and
by
their
aid
we
reached
the
course
i
was
better
off
at
the
next
meeting
for
a
major
of
artillery
provided
me
with
a
small
that
was
very
useful
and
enabled
me
to
keep
my
stores
out
of
reach
of
the
gentry
who
were
as
busy
in
the
crimea
as
at
epsom
or
hampton
court
over
this
tent
waved
the
flag
of
the
british
hotel
but
during
the
day
it
was
struck
for
an
accident
happening
to
one
captain
d
he
was
brought
to
my
tent
insensible
where
i
quickly
improvised
a
couch
of
some
straw
covered
with
the
union
jack
and
brought
him
round
i
mention
this
trifle
to
show
how
ready
of
contrivance
a
little
campaigning
causes
one
to
become
i
had
several
patients
in
consequence
of
accidents
at
the
races
nor
was
i
altogether
free
from
accidents
myself
on
the
occasion
of
the
races
by
the
tchernaya
after
the
armistice
my
cart
on
turning
a
sudden
bend
in
the
steep
track
upset
and
the
crates
containing
plates
and
dishes
rolled
over
and
over
until
their
contents
were
completely
broken
up
so
that
i
was
reduced
to
hand
about
sandwiches
on
broken
pieces
of
earthenware
and
scraps
of
paper
i
saved
some
glasses
but
not
many
and
some
of
the
officers
were
obliged
to
drink
out
of
stiff
paper
twisted
into
glasses
it
was
astonishing
how
well
the
managers
of
these
crimean
races
had
contrived
to
imitate
the
old
familiar
scenes
at
home
you
might
well
wonder
where
the
racing
saddles
and
boots
and
silk
caps
and
jackets
had
come
from
but
our
connection
with
england
was
very
different
to
what
it
had
been
when
i
first
came
to
the
crimea
and
many
a
wife
and
sister
fingers
had
been
busy
making
the
racing
gear
for
the
crimea
meetings
and
in
order
that
the
course
should
still
more
closely
resemble
ascot
or
epsom
some
soldiers
blackened
their
faces
and
came
out
as
ethiopian
serenaders
admirably
although
it
would
puzzle
the
most
ingenious
to
guess
where
they
got
their
wigs
and
banjoes
from
i
caught
one
of
them
behind
my
tent
in
the
act
of
knocking
off
the
neck
of
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
paralysed
by
the
wine
hasty
exit
the
only
excuse
he
offered
was
that
he
wanted
to
know
if
the
luxury
was
better
than
rum
a
few
weeks
before
christmas
happened
that
fearful
explosion
in
the
french
ammunition
park
which
destroyed
so
many
lives
we
had
experienced
nothing
at
all
like
it
before
the
earth
beneath
us
even
at
the
distance
of
three
miles
reeled
and
trembled
with
the
shock
and
so
great
was
the
force
of
the
explosion
that
a
piece
of
stone
was
hurled
with
some
violence
against
the
door
of
the
british
hotel
we
all
felt
for
the
french
very
much
although
i
do
not
think
that
the
armies
agreed
quite
so
well
after
the
taking
of
the
malakhoff
and
the
unsuccessful
assault
upon
the
redan
as
they
had
done
previously
i
saw
several
instances
of
unpleasantness
and
collision
arising
from
allusions
to
sore
points
one
in
particular
occurred
in
my
store
the
french
when
they
wanted
it
was
very
seldom
to
wound
the
pride
of
the
english
soldiery
used
to
say
significantly
in
that
jargon
by
which
the
various
nations
in
the
crimea
endeavoured
to
obviate
the
consequences
of
what
occurred
at
the
tower
of
babel
some
time
ago
malakhoff
bono
redan
no
bono
and
this
of
course
usually
led
to
recriminatory
statements
and
history
was
ransacked
to
find
something
consolatory
to
english
pride
once
i
noticed
a
brawny
man
of
the
army
works
corps
bringing
a
small
french
zouave
to
my
canteen
evidently
with
the
view
of
standing
treat
the
frenchman
seemed
mischievously
inclined
and
probably
relying
upon
the
good
humour
on
the
countenance
of
his
gigantic
companion
began
a
little
playful
badinage
ending
with
the
taunt
of
redan
no
bono
redan
no
bono
i
never
saw
any
man
look
so
helplessly
angry
as
the
englishman
did
for
a
few
minutes
he
seemed
absolutely
rooted
to
the
ground
of
course
he
could
have
crushed
his
mocking
friend
with
ease
but
how
could
he
answer
his
taunt
all
at
once
however
a
happy
thought
struck
him
and
rushing
up
to
the
zouave
he
caught
him
round
the
waist
and
threw
him
down
roaring
out
waterloo
was
bono
waterloo
was
bono
it
was
as
much
as
the
people
on
the
premises
could
do
to
part
them
so
convulsed
were
we
all
with
laughter
and
before
christmas
occurred
my
first
and
last
attack
of
illness
in
the
crimea
it
was
not
of
much
consequence
nor
should
i
mention
it
but
to
show
the
kindness
of
my
i
think
it
arose
from
the
sudden
commencement
of
winter
for
which
i
was
but
poorly
provided
however
i
soon
received
much
sympathy
and
many
presents
of
warm
clothing
etc
but
the
most
delicate
piece
of
attention
was
shown
me
by
one
of
the
sappers
and
miners
who
hearing
the
report
that
i
was
dead
positively
came
down
to
spring
hill
to
take
my
measure
for
a
coffin
this
may
seem
a
questionable
compliment
but
i
really
felt
flattered
and
touched
with
such
a
mark
of
thoughtful
attention
very
few
in
the
crimea
had
the
luxury
of
any
better
coffin
than
a
and
it
was
very
good
of
the
grateful
fellow
to
determine
that
his
old
friend
the
mistress
of
spring
hill
should
have
an
honour
conceded
to
so
very
few
of
the
illustrious
dead
before
sebastopol
so
christmas
came
and
with
it
pleasant
memories
of
home
and
of
home
comforts
with
it
came
also
news
of
home
some
not
of
the
most
pleasant
description
and
kind
wishes
from
absent
friends
a
merry
christmas
to
you
writes
one
and
many
of
them
although
you
will
not
write
to
us
we
see
your
name
frequently
in
the
newspapers
from
which
we
judge
that
you
are
strong
and
hearty
all
your
old
jamaica
friends
are
delighted
to
hear
of
you
and
say
that
you
are
an
honour
to
the
isle
of
springs
i
wonder
if
the
people
of
other
countries
are
as
fond
of
carrying
with
them
everywhere
their
home
habits
as
the
english
i
think
not
i
think
there
was
something
purely
and
essentially
english
in
the
determination
of
the
camp
to
spend
the
of
after
the
good
old
home
fashion
it
showed
itself
weeks
before
the
eventful
day
in
the
dinner
parties
which
were
got
up
in
the
orders
sent
to
england
in
the
supplies
which
came
out
and
in
the
many
applications
made
to
the
hostess
of
the
british
hotel
for
and
the
demand
for
them
and
the
material
necessary
to
manufacture
them
was
marvellous
i
can
fancy
that
if
returns
could
be
got
at
of
the
flour
plums
currants
and
eggs
consumed
on
in
the
crimean
peninsula
they
would
astonish
us
one
determination
appeared
to
have
taken
possession
of
every
mind
to
spend
the
festive
day
with
the
mirth
and
jollity
which
the
changed
prospect
of
affairs
warranted
and
the
recollection
of
a
year
ago
when
death
and
misery
were
the
camp
chief
guests
only
served
to
heighten
this
resolve
for
three
weeks
previous
to
my
time
was
fully
occupied
in
making
preparations
for
it
pages
of
my
books
are
filled
with
orders
for
and
besides
which
i
sold
an
immense
quantity
of
raw
material
to
those
who
were
too
far
off
to
send
down
for
the
manufactured
article
on
and
to
such
purchasers
i
gave
a
plain
recipe
for
their
guidance
will
the
reader
take
any
interest
in
my
crimean
it
was
plain
but
decidedly
good
however
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
one
pound
of
flour
of
a
pound
of
raisins
of
a
pound
of
fat
pork
chopped
fine
two
tablespoonfuls
of
sugar
a
little
cinnamon
or
chopped
lemon
of
milk
or
water
mix
these
well
together
and
boil
four
hours
from
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
until
long
after
the
night
had
set
in
were
i
and
my
cooks
busy
endeavouring
to
supply
the
great
demand
for
christmas
fare
we
had
considerable
difficulty
in
keeping
our
engagements
but
by
substituting
for
in
a
few
cases
we
succeeded
the
scene
in
the
crowded
store
and
even
in
the
little
kitchen
with
the
officers
servants
who
came
in
for
their
masters
dinners
can
not
well
be
described
some
were
impatient
themselves
others
dreaded
their
masters
impatience
as
the
appointed
dinner
hour
passed
by
all
combined
by
entreaties
threats
cajolery
and
fun
to
drive
me
distracted
angry
cries
for
the
which
was
to
have
been
ready
an
hour
ago
alternated
with
an
entreaty
that
i
should
cook
the
captain
to
a
turn
sure
he
likes
them
well
done
bake
as
brown
as
your
own
purty
face
darlint
i
did
not
get
my
dinner
until
eight
and
then
i
dined
in
peace
off
a
fine
wild
turkey
or
bustard
shot
for
me
on
the
marshes
by
the
tchernaya
it
weighed
pounds
and
although
somewhat
coarse
in
colour
had
a
capital
flavour
upon
new
i
had
another
large
cooking
of
and
this
time
upon
my
own
account
i
took
them
to
the
hospital
of
the
land
transport
corps
to
remind
the
patients
of
the
home
comforts
they
longed
so
much
for
it
was
a
sad
sight
to
see
the
once
fine
fellows
in
their
blue
gowns
lying
quiet
and
still
and
reduced
to
such
a
level
of
weakness
and
helplessness
they
all
seemed
glad
for
the
little
home
tokens
i
took
them
there
was
one
patient
who
had
been
a
most
industrious
and
honest
fellow
and
who
did
not
go
into
the
hospital
until
long
and
wearing
illness
compelled
him
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
look
after
him
but
i
found
him
very
weak
and
ill
i
stayed
with
him
until
evening
and
before
i
left
him
kind
fancy
had
brought
to
his
bedside
his
wife
and
children
from
his
in
england
and
i
could
hear
him
talking
to
them
in
a
low
and
joyful
tone
poor
poor
fellow
the
new
year
so
full
of
hope
and
happiness
had
dawned
upon
him
but
he
did
not
live
to
see
the
wild
flowers
spring
up
peacefully
through
the
sod
before

alarming
sacrifice
of
our
stock
a
last
glimpse
of
sebastopol
home
before
the
new
year
was
far
advanced
we
all
began
to
think
of
going
home
making
sure
that
peace
would
soon
be
concluded
and
never
did
more
welcome
message
come
anywhere
than
that
which
brought
us
intelligence
of
the
armistice
and
the
firing
which
had
grown
more
and
more
slack
lately
ceased
altogether
of
course
the
army
did
not
desire
peace
because
they
had
any
distaste
for
fighting
so
far
from
it
i
believe
the
only
more
welcome
intelligence
would
have
been
news
of
a
campaign
in
the
field
but
they
were
most
heartily
weary
of
sieges
and
the
prospect
of
another
year
before
the
gloomy
north
of
sebastopol
damped
the
ardour
of
the
most
sanguine
before
the
armistice
was
signed
the
russians
and
their
old
foes
made
advances
of
friendship
and
the
banks
of
the
tchernaya
used
to
be
thronged
with
strangers
and
many
strange
acquaintances
were
thus
began
i
was
one
of
the
first
to
ride
down
to
the
tchernaya
and
very
much
delighted
seemed
the
russians
to
see
an
english
woman
i
wonder
if
they
thought
they
all
had
my
complexion
i
soon
entered
heartily
into
the
then
current
amusement
that
of
exchanging
coin
with
the
russians
i
stole
a
march
upon
my
companions
by
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
upon
my
bosom
upon
which
a
russian
threw
me
in
exchange
for
some
pence
a
little
metal
figure
of
some
ugly
saint
then
we
wrapped
up
halfpence
in
clay
and
received
coins
of
less
value
in
exchange
seeing
a
soldier
eating
some
white
bread
i
made
signs
of
wanting
some
and
threw
over
a
piece
of
money
i
had
great
difficulty
in
making
the
man
understand
me
but
after
considerable
pantomime
with
surprise
in
his
round
bullet
eyes
he
wrapped
up
his
bread
in
some
paper
then
coated
it
with
clay
and
sent
it
over
to
me
i
thought
it
would
look
well
beside
my
brown
bread
taken
from
the
strange
oven
in
the
terrible
redan
and
that
the
two
would
typify
war
and
peace
there
was
a
great
traffic
going
on
in
such
things
and
a
wag
of
an
officer
who
could
talk
russian
imperfectly
set
himself
to
work
to
persuade
an
innocent
russian
that
i
was
his
wife
and
having
succeeded
in
doing
so
promptly
offered
to
dispose
of
me
for
the
medal
hanging
at
his
breast
the
last
firing
of
any
consequence
was
the
salutes
with
which
the
good
tidings
of
peace
were
received
by
army
and
navy
after
this
soon
began
the
with
happy
faces
and
light
hearts
and
some
kind
thoughts
and
warm
tears
for
the
comrades
left
behind
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
of
peace
also
although
it
must
have
been
apparent
to
every
one
that
it
would
cause
our
ruin
we
had
lately
made
extensive
additions
to
our
store
and
our
shelves
were
filled
with
articles
laid
in
at
a
great
cost
and
which
were
now
unsaleable
and
which
it
would
be
equally
impossible
to
carry
home
everything
from
our
stud
of
horses
and
mules
down
to
our
latest
consignments
from
home
must
be
sold
for
any
price
and
as
it
happened
for
many
things
worth
a
year
ago
their
weight
in
gold
no
purchaser
could
now
be
found
however
more
of
this
hereafter
before
leaving
the
crimea
i
made
various
excursions
into
the
interior
visiting
simpheropol
and
baktchiserai
i
travelled
to
simpheropol
with
a
pretty
large
party
and
had
a
very
amusing
journey
my
companions
were
young
and
full
of
fun
and
tried
hard
to
persuade
the
russians
that
i
was
queen
victoria
by
paying
me
the
most
absurd
reverence
when
this
failed
they
fell
back
a
little
and
declared
that
i
was
the
queen
first
cousin
anyhow
they
attracted
crowds
about
me
and
i
became
quite
a
lioness
in
the
streets
of
simpheropol
until
the
arrival
of
some
highlanders
in
their
uniform
cut
me
out
my
excursion
to
baktchiserai
was
still
more
amusing
and
pleasant
i
found
it
necessary
to
go
to
beat
up
a
russian
merchant
who
after
the
declaration
of
peace
had
purchased
stores
of
us
and
some
young
officers
made
up
a
party
for
the
purpose
we
hired
an
araba
filled
it
with
straw
and
some
boxes
to
sit
upon
and
set
out
very
early
with
two
old
umbrellas
to
shield
us
from
the
sun
and
the
night
dews
we
had
with
us
a
hamper
carefully
packed
before
parting
with
a
cold
duck
some
cold
meat
a
tart
etc
the
tartar
two
horses
were
soon
knocked
up
and
the
fellow
obtained
a
third
at
a
little
village
and
so
we
rolled
on
until
when
thoroughly
exhausted
we
left
our
clumsy
vehicle
and
carried
our
hamper
beneath
the
shade
of
a
beautiful
and
determined
to
lunch
upon
opening
it
the
first
thing
that
met
our
eyes
was
a
fine
rat
who
made
a
speedy
escape
somewhat
gravely
we
proceeded
to
unpack
its
contents
without
caring
to
express
our
fears
to
one
another
and
quite
soon
enough
we
found
them
realized
how
or
where
the
rat
had
gained
access
to
our
hamper
it
was
impossible
to
say
but
he
had
made
no
bad
use
of
his
time
and
both
wings
of
the
cold
duck
had
flown
while
the
tart
was
considerably
mangled
sad
discovery
this
for
people
who
although
hungry
were
still
squeamish
we
made
out
as
well
as
we
could
with
the
cold
beef
and
gave
the
rest
to
our
tartar
driver
who
had
apparently
no
disinclination
to
eating
after
the
rat
and
would
very
likely
have
despised
us
heartily
for
such
weakness
after
dinner
we
went
on
more
briskly
and
succeeded
in
reaching
baktchiserai
my
journey
was
perfectly
unavailing
i
could
not
find
my
debtor
at
home
and
if
i
had
i
was
told
it
would
take
three
weeks
before
the
russian
law
would
assist
me
to
recover
my
claim
determined
however
to
have
some
compensation
i
carried
off
a
raven
who
had
been
croaking
angrily
at
my
intrusion
before
we
had
been
long
on
our
homeward
journey
however
lieut
c
sat
upon
it
of
course
accidentally
and
we
threw
it
to
its
relatives
the
crows
as
the
spring
advanced
the
troops
began
to
move
away
at
a
brisk
pace
as
they
passed
the
iron
house
upon
the
col
old
for
the
crimea
where
so
much
of
life
action
had
been
compressed
into
so
short
a
space
of
time
they
would
stop
and
give
us
a
parting
cheer
while
very
often
the
band
struck
up
some
familiar
tune
of
that
home
they
were
so
gladly
seeking
and
very
often
the
officers
would
find
time
to
run
into
the
british
hotel
to
bid
us
and
give
us
a
farewell
shake
of
the
hand
for
you
see
war
like
death
is
a
great
leveller
and
mutual
suffering
and
endurance
had
made
us
all
friends
my
dear
seacole
and
my
dear
day
wrote
one
on
a
scrap
of
paper
left
on
the
counter
i
have
called
here
four
times
this
day
to
wish
you
i
am
so
sorry
i
was
not
fortunate
enough
to
see
you
i
shall
still
hope
to
see
you
morning
we
march
at
seven
and
yet
all
this
going
home
seemed
strange
and
somewhat
sad
and
sometimes
i
felt
that
i
could
not
sympathise
with
the
glad
faces
and
happy
hearts
of
those
who
were
looking
forward
to
the
delights
of
home
and
the
joy
of
seeing
once
more
the
old
familiar
faces
remembered
so
fondly
in
the
fearful
trenches
and
the
now
and
then
we
would
see
a
lounger
with
a
blank
face
taking
no
interest
in
the
bustle
of
departure
and
with
him
i
acknowledged
to
have
more
than
with
the
others
for
he
as
well
as
i
clearly
had
no
home
to
go
to
he
was
a
soldier
by
choice
and
necessity
as
well
as
by
profession
he
had
no
home
no
loved
friends
the
peace
would
bring
no
particular
pleasure
to
him
whereas
war
and
action
were
necessary
to
his
existence
gave
him
excitement
occupation
the
chance
of
promotion
now
and
then
but
seldom
however
you
came
across
such
a
disappointed
one
was
it
not
so
with
me
had
i
not
been
happy
through
the
months
of
toil
and
danger
never
knowing
what
fear
or
depression
was
finding
every
moment
of
the
day
mortgaged
hours
in
advance
and
earning
sound
sleep
and
contentment
by
sheer
hard
work
what
better
or
happier
lot
could
possibly
befall
me
and
alas
how
likely
was
it
that
my
present
occupation
gone
i
might
long
in
vain
for
another
so
stirring
and
so
useful
besides
which
it
was
pretty
sure
that
i
should
go
to
england
poorer
than
i
left
it
and
although
i
was
not
ashamed
of
poverty
beginning
life
again
in
the
autumn
i
mean
late
in
the
summer
of
life
is
hard
work
peace
concluded
the
little
jealousies
which
may
have
sprung
up
between
the
french
and
their
allies
seemed
forgotten
and
every
one
was
anxious
ere
the
parting
came
to
make
the
most
of
the
time
yet
left
in
improving
old
friendships
and
founding
new
among
others
the
encamped
near
the
woronzoff
road
gave
a
grand
parting
entertainment
to
a
large
company
of
their
french
neighbours
at
which
many
officers
of
high
rank
were
present
i
was
applied
to
by
the
committee
of
management
to
superintend
the
affair
and
for
the
last
time
in
the
crimea
the
health
of
madame
seacole
was
proposed
and
duly
honoured
i
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
the
honour
that
i
had
no
difficulty
in
returning
thanks
in
a
speech
which
colonel
b
interpreted
amid
roars
of
laughter
to
the
french
guests
as
the
various
regiments
moved
off
i
received
many
acknowledgments
from
those
who
thought
they
owed
me
gratitude
little
presents
warm
farewell
words
kind
letters
full
of
grateful
acknowledgments
for
services
so
small
that
i
had
forgotten
them
long
long
ago
how
easy
it
is
to
reach
warm
hearts
little
thoughtful
acts
of
kindness
even
from
the
humblest
and
these
touched
me
the
most
i
value
the
letters
received
from
the
working
men
far
more
than
the
testimonials
of
their
officers
i
had
nothing
to
gain
from
the
former
and
can
point
to
their
testimony
fearlessly
i
am
strongly
tempted
to
insert
some
of
these
acknowledgments
but
i
will
confine
myself
to
one
camp
near
karani
june
my
dear
seacole
as
you
are
about
to
leave
the
crimea
i
avail
myself
of
the
only
opportunity
which
may
occur
for
some
time
to
acknowledge
my
gratitude
to
you
and
to
thank
you
for
the
kindness
which
i
in
common
with
many
others
received
at
your
hands
when
attacked
with
cholera
in
the
spring
of
but
i
have
no
language
to
do
it
suitably
i
am
truly
sensible
that
your
kindness
far
exceeded
my
claims
upon
your
sympathy
it
is
said
by
some
of
your
friends
i
hope
truly
that
you
are
going
to
england
there
can
be
none
from
the
crimea
more
welcome
there
for
your
kindness
in
the
and
your
heroism
in
the
have
endeared
you
to
the
whole
army
i
am
sure
when
her
most
gracious
majesty
the
queen
shall
have
become
acquainted
with
the
service
you
have
gratuitously
rendered
to
so
many
of
her
brave
soldiers
her
generous
heart
will
thank
you
for
you
have
been
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
almighty
to
preserve
many
a
gallant
heart
to
the
empire
to
fight
and
win
her
battles
if
ever
again
war
may
become
a
necessity
please
to
accept
this
from
your
most
grateful
humble
servant
j
tynan
but
i
had
other
friends
in
the
crimea
friends
who
could
never
thank
me
some
of
them
lay
in
their
last
sleep
beneath
indistinguishable
mounds
of
earth
some
in
the
trenches
a
few
beneath
the
blue
waters
of
the
euxine
i
might
in
vain
attempt
to
gather
the
wild
flowers
which
sprung
up
above
many
of
their
graves
but
i
knew
where
some
lay
and
could
visit
their
last
homes
on
earth
and
to
all
the
cemeteries
where
friends
rested
so
calmly
sleeping
well
after
a
life
work
nobly
done
i
went
many
times
lingering
long
over
many
a
mound
that
bore
the
names
of
those
whom
i
had
been
familiar
with
in
life
thinking
of
what
they
had
been
and
what
i
had
known
of
them
over
some
i
planted
shrubs
and
flowers
little
lilac
trees
obtained
with
no
small
trouble
and
flowering
evergreens
which
looked
quite
gay
and
pretty
ere
i
left
and
may
in
time
become
great
trees
and
witness
strange
scenes
or
be
cut
down
as
fuel
for
another
besieging
army
who
can
tell
and
from
many
graves
i
picked
up
pebbles
and
plucked
simple
or
tufts
of
grass
as
memorials
for
relatives
at
home
how
pretty
the
cemeteries
used
to
look
beneath
the
blue
peaceful
sky
neatly
enclosed
with
stone
walls
and
full
of
the
reared
by
friends
over
friends
i
met
many
here
thoughtfully
taking
their
last
look
of
the
of
those
they
knew
and
loved
i
saw
many
a
proud
head
bowed
down
above
them
i
knew
that
many
a
proud
heart
laid
aside
its
pride
here
and
stood
in
the
presence
of
death
humble
and
childlike
and
by
the
clasped
hand
and
moistened
eye
i
knew
that
from
many
a
heart
sped
upward
a
grateful
prayer
to
the
providence
which
had
thought
fit
in
his
judgment
to
take
some
and
in
his
mercy
to
spare
the
rest
some
three
weeks
before
the
crimea
was
finally
evacuated
we
moved
from
our
old
quarters
to
balaclava
where
we
had
obtained
permission
to
fit
up
a
store
for
the
short
time
which
would
elapse
before
the
last
red
coat
left
russian
soil
the
poor
old
british
hotel
we
could
do
nothing
with
it
the
iron
house
was
pulled
down
and
packed
up
for
conveyance
home
but
the
russians
got
all
of
the
and
sheds
which
was
not
used
as
fuel
all
the
kitchen
fittings
and
stoves
that
had
cost
us
so
much
fell
also
into
their
hands
i
only
wish
some
cook
worthy
to
possess
them
has
them
now
we
could
sell
nothing
our
horses
were
almost
given
away
our
large
stores
of
provisions
were
at
any
one
service
it
makes
my
heart
sick
to
talk
of
the
really
alarming
sacrifices
we
made
the
russians
crowded
down
ostensibly
to
purchase
in
reality
to
plunder
prime
cheeses
which
had
cost
us
tenpence
a
pound
were
sold
to
them
for
less
than
a
penny
a
pound
for
wine
for
which
we
had
paid
shillings
a
dozen
they
bid
four
shillings
i
could
not
stand
this
and
in
a
fit
of
desperation
i
snatched
up
a
hammer
and
broke
up
case
after
case
while
the
bystanders
held
out
their
hands
and
caught
the
ruby
stream
it
may
have
been
wrong
but
i
was
too
excited
to
think
there
was
no
more
of
my
own
people
to
give
it
to
and
i
would
rather
not
present
it
to
our
old
foes
we
were
among
the
last
to
leave
the
crimea
before
going
i
borrowed
a
horse
easy
enough
now
and
rode
up
the
old
road
how
unfamiliar
in
its
loneliness
and
quiet
to
cathcart
hill
i
wished
once
more
to
impress
the
scene
upon
my
mind
it
was
a
beautifully
clear
evening
and
we
could
see
miles
away
across
the
darkening
sea
i
spent
some
time
there
with
my
companions
pointing
out
to
each
other
the
sites
of
scenes
we
all
remembered
so
well
there
were
the
trenches
already
becoming
indistinguishable
out
of
which
on
the
of
september
we
had
seen
the
storming
parties
tumble
in
confused
and
scattered
bodies
before
they
ran
up
the
broken
height
of
the
redan
there
the
malakhoff
into
which
we
had
also
seen
the
luckier
french
pour
in
one
unbroken
stream
below
lay
the
crumbling
city
and
the
quiet
harbour
with
scarce
a
ripple
on
its
surface
while
around
stretched
away
the
deserted
huts
for
miles
it
was
with
something
like
regret
that
we
said
to
one
another
that
the
play
was
fairly
over
that
peace
had
rung
the
curtain
down
and
that
we
humble
actors
in
some
of
its
most
stirring
scenes
must
seek
engagements
elsewhere
i
lingered
behind
and
stooping
down
once
more
gathered
little
tufts
of
grass
and
some
simple
blossoms
from
above
the
graves
of
some
who
in
life
had
been
very
kind
to
me
and
i
left
behind
in
exchange
a
few
tears
which
were
sincere
a
few
days
latter
and
i
stood
on
board
a
crowded
steamer
taking
my
last
look
of
the
shores
of
the
crimea
conclusion
i
did
not
return
to
england
by
the
most
direct
route
but
took
the
opportunity
of
seeing
more
of
men
and
manners
in
yet
other
lands
arrived
in
england
at
last
we
set
to
work
bravely
at
aldershott
to
retrieve
our
fallen
fortunes
and
stem
off
the
ruin
originated
in
the
crimea
but
all
in
vain
and
at
last
defeated
by
fortune
but
not
i
think
disgraced
we
were
obliged
to
capitulate
on
very
honourable
conditions
in
plain
truth
the
old
crimean
firm
of
seacole
and
day
was
dissolved
finally
and
its
partners
had
to
recommence
the
world
anew
and
so
ended
campaign
one
of
us
started
only
the
other
day
for
the
antipodes
while
the
other
is
ready
to
take
any
journey
to
any
place
where
a
stout
heart
and
two
experienced
hands
may
be
of
use
perhaps
it
would
be
right
if
i
were
to
express
more
shame
and
annoyance
than
i
really
feel
at
the
pecuniarily
disastrous
issue
of
my
crimean
adventures
but
i
can
not
i
really
can
not
when
i
would
try
and
feel
ashamed
of
myself
for
being
poor
and
helpless
i
only
experience
a
glow
of
pride
at
the
other
and
more
pleasing
events
of
my
career
when
i
think
of
the
few
whom
i
failed
to
pay
in
full
and
so
far
from
blaming
me
some
of
them
are
now
my
firmest
friends
i
can
not
help
remembering
also
the
many
who
profess
themselves
indebted
to
me
let
me
in
as
few
words
as
possible
state
the
results
of
my
crimean
campaign
to
be
sure
i
returned
from
it
shaken
in
health
i
came
home
wounded
as
many
others
did
few
constitutions
indeed
were
the
better
for
those
winters
before
sebastopol
and
i
was
too
hard
worked
not
to
feel
their
effects
for
a
little
labour
fatigues
me
now
i
can
not
watch
by
as
i
could
a
week
want
of
rest
quite
knocks
me
up
now
then
i
returned
bankrupt
in
fortune
whereas
others
in
my
position
may
have
come
back
to
england
rich
and
prosperous
i
found
myself
poor
beggared
so
few
words
can
tell
what
i
have
lost
but
what
have
i
gained
i
should
need
a
volume
to
describe
that
fairly
so
much
is
it
and
so
cheaply
purchased
by
suffering
ten
times
worse
than
what
i
have
experienced
i
have
more
than
once
heard
people
say
that
they
would
gladly
suffer
illness
to
enjoy
the
delights
of
convalescence
and
so
by
enduring
a
few
days
pain
gain
the
tender
love
of
relatives
and
sympathy
of
friends
and
on
this
principle
i
rejoice
in
the
trials
which
have
borne
me
such
pleasures
as
those
i
now
enjoy
for
wherever
i
go
i
am
sure
to
meet
some
smiling
face
every
step
i
take
in
the
crowded
london
streets
may
bring
me
in
contact
with
some
friend
forgotten
by
me
perhaps
but
who
soon
reminds
me
of
our
old
life
before
sebastopol
it
seems
very
long
ago
now
when
i
was
of
use
to
him
and
he
to
me
where
indeed
do
i
not
find
friends
in
omnibuses
in
river
steamboats
in
places
of
public
amusement
in
quiet
streets
and
courts
where
taking
short
cuts
i
lose
my
way
spring
up
old
familiar
faces
to
remind
me
of
the
months
spent
on
spring
hill
the
sentries
at
whitehall
relax
from
the
discharge
of
their
important
duty
of
guarding
nothing
to
give
me
a
smile
of
recognition
the
very
newspaper
offices
look
friendly
as
i
pass
them
by
busy
yard
puts
on
a
cheering
smile
and
the
office
in
fleet
street
sometimes
laughs
outright
now
would
all
this
have
happened
if
i
had
returned
to
england
a
rich
woman
surely
not
a
few
words
more
ere
i
bring
these
egotistical
remarks
to
a
close
it
is
naturally
with
feelings
of
pride
and
pleasure
that
i
allude
to
the
committee
recently
organized
to
aid
me
and
if
i
indulge
in
the
vanity
of
placing
their
names
before
my
readers
it
is
simply
because
every
one
of
the
following
noblemen
and
gentlemen
knew
me
in
the
crimea
and
by
consenting
to
assist
me
now
record
publicly
their
opinion
of
my
services
there
and
yet
i
may
reasonably
on
other
grounds
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
it
has
been
stated
publicly
that
my
present
embarrassments
originated
in
my
charities

incessant
labours
