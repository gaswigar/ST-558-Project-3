audrey

chapter
i
everybody
knew
that
miss
audrey
craven
was
the
original
of
laura
the
heroine
of
langley
wyndham
masterpiece
she
first
attracted
the
attention
of
that
student
of
human
nature
at
oxford
at
a
dinner
given
by
her
guardian
the
dean
of
benedict
ostensibly
in
honour
of
the
new
master
of
lazarus
in
reality
for
his
ward
entertainment
and
instruction
in
the
bewildering
art
of
life
it
was
out
of
doors
a
hot
and
sleepy
air
hung
over
the
city
indoors
the
forecast
was
no
less
heavy
and
depressing
not
so
however
to
miss
audrey
craven
the
party
was
large
and
mixed
and
to
the
fresh
untutored
mind
of
a
tyro
this
in
itself
was
promising
the
dean
pursued
the
ruinous
policy
of
being
all
things
to
all
men
and
together
with
nonentities
and
oxonians
of
european
renown
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
celebrities
from
the
outside
world
among
these
were
langley
wyndham
the
eminent
novelist
and
his
friend
percival
knowles
the
critic
who
had
helped
him
to
his
eminence
having
collected
these
discordant
elements
around
him
the
dean
withdrew
from
the
unequal
contest
and
hovered
smiling
ineffectually
on
the
outskirts
of
his
little
chaos
perhaps
he
tried
to
find
comfort
in
a
conscience
satisfied
for
a
party
spoiled
but
for
audrey
this
wild
confusion
was
rich
in
possibility
however
baffling
to
those
officially
responsible
it
offered
a
wider
field
for
individual
enterprise
and
if
she
did
not
possess
that
fine
flow
of
animal
spirits
which
sometimes
supports
lesser
minds
under
such
circumstances
she
had
other
qualities
which
stood
her
in
good
stead
conspicuous
amongst
these
was
an
indomitable
moral
courage
she
prepared
to
hurl
herself
into
the
breach
wyndham
was
standing
a
little
apart
from
the
herd
leaning
against
the
wall
as
if
overcome
by
an
atmosphere
too
oppressive
for
endurance
when
he
saw
his
friend
approaching
him
knowles
was
looking
about
him
with
eyes
alert
and
that
furtive
but
uncontrollable
smile
which
made
ladies
say
yes
but
knowles
is
so
dreadfully
cynical
you
know
by
the
way
wyndham
i
do
want
to
startle
you
but
there
is
a
lady
here
who
particularly
wants
me
to
introduce
you
to
her
wyndham
turned
on
him
a
look
terrible
in
its
dignified
reproach
anything
but
that
my
dear
fellow
no
more
introductions
please
i
just
suffered
torture
from
an
unspeakable
youth
from
aberdeen
who
expected
me
to
rejoice
with
him
because
oxford
is
at
last
recognising
the
of
a
metapheesical
principle
in
the
and
mon
i
admit
that
the
party
is
dull
from
a
mere
worldling
point
of
view
but
it
a
glorious
field
for
the
student
of
human
nature
and
here
an
opportunity
for
exceptional
research
something
quite
off
the
beaten
track
the
admirer
of
you
and
all
your
works
is
the
lovely
miss
craven
and
i
assure
you
she
creating
a
sensation
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
which
is
she
there
the
girl
with
the
hair
talking
to
broadbent
ah
that
one
no
thanks
i
know
what
you
going
to
tell
me
she
she
does
but
she
pretty
enough
to
do
that
or
anything
else
she
chooses
scandal
says
she
looking
for
a
religion
she
must
be
a
simple
soul
if
she
thinks
she
can
pick
up
the
article
in
oxford
oh
i
do
know
religions
are
cheap
everywhere
nowadays
the
supply
being
so
remarkably
in
excess
of
the
demand
and
miss
craven
soul
may
be
immortal
we
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
but
its
simplicity
is
grand
what
the
matter
it
makes
me
ill
to
see
the
way
these
fellows
go
about
leading
captive
silly
women
do
look
at
broadbent
cramming
his
spiritual
pabulum
into
that
girl
mouth
moral
platitudes
all
the
old
crusts
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
soaked
in
the
of
sentiment
and
a
little
new
wine
with
the
alcohol
extracted
by
the
latest
process
no
possible
risk
of
injury
to
the
bottles
do
be
uneasy
i
been
watching
her
all
evening
ever
since
i
found
her
in
a
corner
with
the
unspeakable
youth
talking
transcendentalism
a
woman
who
can
look
you
in
the
face
and
ask
you
if
you
have
ever
doubted
your
own
existence
and
if
it
is
a
very
weird
and
unaccountable
sensation
would
be
capable
of
anything
five
minutes
afterwards
she
was
complimenting
flaxman
reed
on
the
splendid
logic
of
the
roman
faith
and
now
i
no
doubt
she
contributing
valuable
material
to
great
work
on
the
fourth
gospel
he
was
wrong
at
that
moment
the
earnest
seeker
after
truth
was
gazing
abstractedly
in
his
direction
and
had
left
the
canon
lecturing
to
empty
benches
balancing
himself
on
his
toes
while
he
defined
his
theological
position
with
convincing
emphasis
of
finger
and
thumb
what
he
said
is
neither
here
nor
there
then
wyndham
repented
of
his
rudeness
he
waited
till
knowles
was
looking
another
way
and
made
for
the
dean
in
a
approaching
him
from
the
rear
to
find
him
introducing
a
late
arrival
to
his
niece
he
heard
the
name
jackson
and
noted
the
faint
shade
of
annoyance
on
the
girl
face
as
the
interloper
sat
down
beside
her
with
a
smile
of
dreamy
content
it
was
enough
to
quench
languid
ardour
he
was
not
going
to
take
any
more
trouble
to
get
an
introduction
to
miss
audrey
craven
he
saw
her
once
more
that
evening
as
he
turned
to
take
leave
of
his
host
she
was
still
sitting
beside
jackson
and
wyndham
watched
them
furtively
jackson
was
a
heavy
young
man
with
a
large
and
no
profile
to
speak
of
to
judge
by
miss
expression
his
conversation
was
not
very
interesting
though
he
was
evidently
exerting
himself
to
give
it
a
humorous
turn
wyndham
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
hard
lines
was
it
said
knowles
at
his
elbow
brilliant
idea
of
the
dean
though
introduce
the
biggest
bore
in
the
county
to
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
room
the
unconscious
jackson
burst
into
laughter
and
audrey
raised
her
eyebrows
she
looked
from
jackson
to
wyndham
and
from
wyndham
to
jackson
and
laughed
a
low
musical
laugh
without
any
humour
in
it
which
echoed
unmusically
in
the
memory
wyndham
turned
abruptly
away
and
audrey
looked
after
him
as
he
turned
her
face
was
that
of
one
who
sees
her
last
hope
disappearing
poor
audrey
who
would
not
have
pitied
her
after
hovering
all
evening
on
the
verge
of
an
introduction
to
his
eminence
it
was
hard
to
bear
the
irony
of
this
decline
unsustained
by
any
sense
of
its
comedy
he
had
avoided
her
in
the
most
marked
manner
but
all
the
same
she
wondered
whether
he
was
thinking
about
her
and
if
so
what
he
was
thinking
what
he
thought
that
night
and
the
next
and
the
next
after
that
was
something
like
this
my
dear
lady
you
think
yourself
remarkably
clever
but
really
there
is
nothing
striking
about
you
except
the
colour
of
your
hair
biggest
bore
in
the
county
prettiest
girl
in
the
room
if
it
were
for
your
prettiness
well
as
yet
that
may
have
saved
you
from
being
a
bore
after
that
he
laughed
whenever
he
caught
himself
trying
to
piece
together
the
image
which
his
memory
persistently
presented
to
him
in
fragments
now
an
oval
face
tinged
with
a
childlike
bloom
now
grey
eyes
ringed
with
black
under
dark
eyebrows
and
lashes
or
a
little
roman
nose
with
a
sensitive
tip
or
a
mouth
that
to
the
best
of
his
recollection
curled
up
at
the
corners
making
a
perpetual
dimple
in
each
cheek
they
were
frivolous
details
but
for
weeks
he
carried
them
about
with
him
along
with
his
more
valuable
property
chapter
ii
scandal
was
mistaken
miss
audrey
craven
was
not
in
search
of
a
religion
but
she
had
passed
all
her
life
looking
for
a
revelation
she
had
no
idea
of
the
precise
form
it
was
to
take
but
had
never
wavered
in
her
belief
that
it
was
there
waiting
for
her
as
it
were
round
a
dark
corner
hitherto
the
ideal
had
shown
a
provoking
reticence
the
perfectly
unique
sensation
had
failed
to
turn
up
at
the
critical
moment
audrey
had
reached
the
ripe
age
of
ten
before
the
death
of
her
father
and
mother
and
this
event
could
not
be
expected
to
provide
her
with
a
wholly
new
emotion
she
had
been
familiarised
with
sorrow
through
fine
gradations
of
funereal
tragedy
having
witnessed
the
passing
of
her
canary
her
dormouse
and
her
rabbit
the
end
of
these
engaging
creatures
had
been
peculiarly
distressing
hastened
as
it
was
by
starvation
under
most
insanitary
conditions
the
age
of
ten
is
the
age
of
disenchantment
for
those
of
us
who
can
take
a
hint
for
audrey
disenchantment
never
wholly
came
she
went
on
making
the
same
extravagant
demands
without
a
suspicion
of
the
limited
resources
of
life
it
was
the
way
of
the
cravens
up
to
the
last
her
father
never
lost
his
blind
confidence
in
a
world
which
had
provided
him
with
a
great
deal
of
irregular
amusement
but
the
late
craven
could
be
wise
for
others
though
not
for
himself
and
he
had
taken
a
singular
precaution
with
regard
to
his
daughter
not
counting
the
wife
whom
he
had
too
soon
ceased
to
care
for
he
had
a
low
opinion
of
all
women
and
he
distrusted
audrey
temperament
judging
it
probably
by
his
own
and
that
of
his
more
intimate
acquaintance
by
a
special
clause
in
his
will
she
had
to
wait
for
her
majority
four
years
longer
than
the
term
by
law
appointed
further
until
she
reached
her
majority
she
was
to
spend
six
months
of
the
year
at
oxford
near
her
guardian
for
the
forming
and
informing
of
her
mind
always
supposing
that
she
had
a
mind
to
form
and
now
at
the
age
of
being
the
mistress
of
her
own
person
her
own
income
and
her
own
house
in
chelsea
she
was
still
looking
out
for
a
revelation
her
cousin
vincent
hardy
believed
that
he
had
been
providentially
invented
to
supply
it
but
in
the
nature
of
things
a
cousin
whom
you
have
known
familiarly
from
childhood
can
not
strike
you
as
a
revelation
he
is
really
little
better
than
a
more
or
less
animated
platitude
vincent
hardy
would
have
been
unaffectedly
surprised
if
you
had
told
him
so
to
himself
he
seemed
the
very
incarnation
of
distinguished
paradox
this
simply
meant
that
he
was
one
of
those
who
innocently
imagine
that
they
can
defy
the
minor
conventions
with
a
rarer
grace
than
other
men
certainly
his
was
not
exactly
the
sort
of
figure
that
convention
expects
to
find
in
its
at
nine
in
the
evening
it
was
in
audrey
house
in
chelsea
the
little
brown
house
with
discreet
white
that
stands
back
from
the
embankment
screened
by
the
narrow
strip
of
railed
plantation
known
as
chelsea
gardens
here
or
hereabouts
hardy
was
to
be
met
with
at
any
hour
of
the
day
and
late
one
july
evening
he
had
settled
himself
as
usual
near
a
certain
cosy
corner
in
the
big
his
face
and
especially
his
nose
was
bronzed
with
recent
exercise
in
sun
and
wind
his
hair
was
limp
with
the
steam
of
his
own
speed
and
on
his
forehead
his
hat
had
left
its
mark
in
a
deep
red
cincture
his
loose
shooting
jacket
worn
open
displayed
a
flannel
shirt
white
but
not
too
white
this
much
of
hardy
was
raised
and
supported
on
his
elbow
the
rest
of
him
encased
in
knickerbockers
stockings
and
exceedingly
muddy
boots
sprawled
with
a
naïve
abandonment
at
the
feet
of
the
owner
of
the
lying
in
this
easy
attitude
he
delivered
himself
of
the
following
address
life
in
london
is
a
life
for
lunatics
and
life
in
england
generally
is
a
glorious
life
for
clergymen
and
but
it
not
the
life
for
a
man
it
was
all
very
well
in
the
last
century
you
know
when
englishmen
were
men
first
and
lunatics
if
they
chose
or
clergymen
or
afterwards
ah
if
that
was
exactly
our
golden
age
it
was
the
age
of
our
maturity
of
our
manhood
if
you
doubt
it
read
the
literature
of
the
eighteenth
century
take
fielding
no
do
take
fielding
anyhow
since
then
we
have
added
nothing
to
the
fabric
of
life
to
pile
it
on
above
we
simply
been
digging
away
like
mad
from
below
and
at
last
our
civilisation
is
nodding
to
its
fall
and
its
fall
will
sweep
us
all
back
into
barbarism
again
then
when
we
are
forced
back
into
natural
conditions
the
new
race
will
be
born
no
more
of
your
manikins
we
shall
have
a
chance
then
of
seeing
a
that
is
a
perfect
animal
you
may
turn
up
your
nose
my
superfine
lady
let
me
tell
you
that
this
glorious
animalism
means
sanity
and
sanity
means
strength
and
strength
means
virtue
vir
hardy
sat
up
and
caressed
the
calves
of
his
legs
with
thoughtful
emotion
as
if
he
recognised
them
as
the
sources
of
the
moral
law
within
him
his
cousin
had
not
followed
his
precipitate
logic
with
aversion
from
the
abstract
she
was
concentrating
her
attention
on
the
concrete
case
the
glorious
animal
before
her
now
it
would
be
very
wrong
to
suppose
that
hardy
was
in
the
least
tainted
with
socialism
anarchism
or
any
such
pestilent
heresies
or
that
he
had
read
emile
and
walden
he
had
never
heard
of
either
of
these
works
and
had
no
desire
whatever
for
the
restoration
of
society
on
a
primitive
basis
of
animalism
modified
by
light
literature
clothing
and
the
moral
law
for
all
modern
theories
he
had
a
withering
contempt
his
own
simple
creed
being
that
in
the
beginning
god
made
man
a
tory
squire
his
quarrel
with
the
social
order
was
a
purely
private
and
particular
one
in
our
modern
mythology
custom
circumstance
and
heredity
are
the
three
fates
that
weave
the
web
of
human
life
hardy
did
not
wholly
sympathise
with
this
belief
he
had
too
profound
a
respect
for
his
own
pedigree
to
lay
his
sins
at
his
door
as
the
nephew
of
a
tory
squire
he
was
but
two
degrees
removed
from
original
righteousness
in
spite
of
this
consideration
he
was
wont
to
describe
himself
with
engaging
candour
as
a
bad
hat
in
doing
so
he
recognised
that
he
was
a
dependent
part
of
a
vast
and
complicated
system
if
he
vincent
hardy
was
a
bad
hat
who
was
to
blame
for
it
obviously
civilisation
for
providing
him
with
temptation
and
society
for
supplying
encouragement
as
a
consequence
he
owed
both
civilisation
and
society
a
grudge
therefore
i
say
that
a
return
to
barbarism
will
be
our
salvation
you
and
i
may
live
to
see
the
day
but
here
the
impassioned
orator
who
had
been
making
charges
at
his
boots
with
the
point
of
his
succeeded
in
detaching
a
large
cake
of
mud
which
he
immediately
ground
to
powder
on
the
carpet
civilisation
personified
in
audrey
craven
gazed
at
him
in
polite
reproach
my
new
carpet
will
certainly
not
live
to
see
it
it
may
be
part
of
the
detestable
social
order
but
it
is
not
responsible
for
it
any
more
than
i
am
never
mind
audrey
it
honest
hertfordshire
mud
clean
from
the
country
as
god
made
it
if
i
had
had
to
cross
your
filthy
london
in
order
to
get
here
audrey
smiled
though
she
knew
that
brown
streaks
of
the
honest
hertfordshire
mud
marked
the
hero
passage
from
the
doorway
to
her
feet
she
was
naturally
and
seldom
repulsed
any
one
save
a
few
of
the
more
impertinent
of
her
own
sex
she
lay
back
in
her
cosy
corner
outwardly
contemplating
the
unusual
length
of
muscular
humanity
extended
before
her
inwardly
admiring
her
own
smile
a
smile
of
indulgent
lips
and
arch
eyebrows
in
which
the
eyes
preserved
a
languid
neutrality
being
thus
pleasantly
preoccupied
she
may
be
supposed
ignorant
of
her
cousin
broad
gaze
of
unreflecting
admiration
and
totally
unprepared
for
his
rapid
change
of
theme
audrey
he
began
with
alarming
suddenness
some
people
would
lead
up
to
the
subject
cautiously
that
would
only
waste
time
and
everything
now
is
miss
craven
at
home
miss
craven
is
always
at
home
when
i
am
would
you
like
to
see
her
see
her
good
heavens
no
do
you
know
positively
where
she
is
secreting
herself
or
must
i
lock
the
door
that
is
unnecessary
she
will
not
come
in
she
never
does
a
suspicious
look
darted
from
the
corners
of
hardy
eyes
except
when
i
ask
her
added
audrey
sweetly
well
then
if
you
can
ensure
me
against
the
sort
of
interruption
that
annoyed
me
before
we
will
return
to
the
question
we
were
discussing
when
please
do
go
over
any
old
ground
that
would
bore
me
it
would
bore
i
will
begin
where
we
left
off
the
problem
if
you
remember
was
this
to
put
it
baldly
do
you
care
for
me
or
do
you
not
did
we
get
any
farther
than
that
no
we
did
do
i
or
do
i
not
really
i
can
not
tell
you
vincent
for
i
do
know
myself
nonsense
there
no
logical
dilemma
you
ca
go
on
for
ever
treating
it
as
an
open
question
well
you
draw
such
absurdly
lines
audrey
do
you
honestly
suppose
that
i
walked
here
thirty
miles
parboiled
between
sun
and
rain
in
order
to
be
made
a
fool
of
in
his
excitement
hardy
forgot
that
twenty
miles
was
the
precise
distance
and
that
he
had
much
better
have
taken
the
train
how
much
longer
are
you
going
to
keep
up
this
fiendish
sort
of
game
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
ten
years
is
a
devil
of
a
time
to
keep
a
man
waiting
for
his
answer
ten
years
ten
days
you
mean
excuse
me
i
broached
this
subject
for
the
first
time
ten
years
ago
oh
i
daresay
when
we
were
both
children
we
are
neither
of
us
children
now
audrey
speak
for
yourself
i
was
an
infant
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
till
the
other
day
you
are
let
me
see
if
you
have
any
mind
at
all
you
must
have
made
it
up
by
this
time
the
case
would
be
much
easier
if
you
were
not
such
a
mass
of
inconsistency
yourself
i
been
consistent
enough
in
one
respect
do
you
remember
the
first
time
you
stayed
with
us
at
woodford
when
you
were
much
higher
than
that
table
and
how
you
and
i
set
off
together
for
wanstead
woods
yes
before
breakfast
i
have
never
forgotten
it
nor
i
you
did
rile
me
that
day
audrey
you
waited
till
we
came
within
a
of
the
woods
and
then
you
sat
down
in
a
turnip
field
and
cried
because
you
could
go
any
farther
after
running
at
your
heels
for
two
miles
like
a
dog
yes
and
with
the
irresponsibility
of
the
inferior
animal
eating
up
the
whole
of
the
cake
i
provided
for
us
both
it
was
perfectly
fair
you
dragged
me
out
against
my
will
so
you
argued
at
the
time
but
i
could
follow
your
reasoning
perhaps
you
have
forgotten
how
i
carried
you
on
my
back
to
woodford
and
then
gave
the
milkman
sixpence
to
drive
us
the
rest
of
the
way
home
and
you
were
such
a
contemptible
little
snob
that
you
cried
again
because
you
had
to
sit
next
the
milkman
i
remember
perfectly
you
only
carried
me
as
far
as
red
bridge
in
a
position
the
most
comfortable
for
yourself
and
the
most
undignified
for
me
you
borrowed
that
sixpence
from
me
and
never
paid
me
again
and
we
were
punished
with
dry
bread
for
breakfast
because
we
were
seen
in
the
the
abominable
injustice
of
my
parents
was
of
a
piece
with
the
whole
system
i
complain
of
you
will
observe
that
we
were
punished
not
for
disobedience
but
for
riding
in
a
and
not
so
much
for
being
in
it
as
for
being
seen
in
it
exactly
otherwise
the
reminiscence
would
be
slightly
irrelevant
not
at
all
it
illustrates
my
consistency
i
loved
you
then
in
spite
of
your
detestable
conduct
in
the
matter
of
that
cake
and
i
have
loved
you
ever
since
in
spite
of
your
other
faults
thank
you
i
suppose
you
would
prefer
some
hypocrite
who
told
you
that
you
had
none
on
the
contrary
i
enjoy
being
told
of
my
faults
this
was
true
if
it
came
to
the
point
audrey
would
boldly
offer
her
own
character
for
dissection
rather
than
suffer
conversation
to
be
diverted
to
a
less
interesting
topic
hardy
had
rather
neglected
these
opportunities
for
psychological
study
and
herein
lay
the
secret
of
his
failure
he
continued
adopting
a
more
practical
line
of
argument
suggested
by
the
episode
of
the
sixpence
it
not
as
if
you
were
a
millionaire
and
i
a
grovelling
pauper
i
shall
have
lavernac
and
two
thousand
when
my
uncle
sir
theophilus
parker
dies
hardy
rolled
out
the
title
with
a
certain
proprietary
unction
his
cousin
had
no
share
in
this
enviable
relationship
i
give
the
old
bird
five
years
at
the
very
worst
and
it
a
moral
impossibility
that
he
should
leave
me
in
the
lurch
but
i
do
count
on
that
my
own
property
has
kept
me
idle
all
my
life
but
i
sold
it
at
last
and
as
i
said
just
now
i
am
going
out
to
canada
to
farm
audrey
blushed
and
punished
her
blush
with
a
frown
if
she
had
been
playing
the
amusing
game
that
hardy
suggested
it
was
one
thing
to
give
the
mouse
a
little
run
in
order
to
renew
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
another
thing
to
let
him
escape
altogether
from
her
paws
hardy
saw
his
advantage
and
followed
it
up
when
i
told
you
that
i
had
done
with
civilisation
i
suppose
you
thought
it
was
a
joke
i
did
only
i
could
see
the
point
the
point
is
this
that
i
going
down
to
liverpool
and
shall
sail
for
canada
this
day
week
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
i
ca
breathe
here
town
or
country
it
all
the
same
the
air
chokes
me
it
teeming
with
moral
bacilli
you
never
thought
i
was
so
particular
no
more
did
i
he
paused
knitting
his
brows
i
admit
frankly
that
i
a
bad
hat
this
place
has
been
my
ruin
as
it
has
of
many
a
better
man
than
me
perhaps
if
it
had
been
for
you
audrey
but
i
wo
press
that
point
it
would
be
generous
however
just
anyhow
whatever
my
past
has
been
my
future
lies
in
your
hands
i
would
say
your
love
was
life
or
death
to
me
but
that
would
be
anywhere
near
the
truth
it
not
so
much
a
question
of
death
as
a
question
of
damnation
hardy
was
desperately
in
earnest
but
not
so
much
so
as
to
be
careless
of
rhetorical
effect
in
his
desire
to
represent
himself
as
a
fallen
angel
he
had
done
himself
no
little
injustice
as
well
as
grossly
exaggerated
the
power
of
audrey
regenerative
influence
she
was
evidently
moved
she
took
no
pains
to
restrain
the
trembling
of
her
lips
more
than
was
necessary
to
preserve
their
delicate
outline
hardy
had
paid
homage
to
her
as
the
superior
being
it
marked
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
his
passion
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
down
on
her
as
from
a
height
a
fallen
angel
is
not
without
his
epic
sublimity
the
lady
hesitated
she
pulled
out
the
tremolo
stop
and
then
spoke
you
say
that
if
it
had
been
for
me
i
do
quite
understand
you
but
you
are
mistaken
if
you
think
i
never
cared
for
you
never
cared
i
mean
to
say
for
your
good
she
also
rose
with
an
air
of
having
made
a
statement
as
final
as
it
was
clear
and
convincing
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
looked
steadily
in
her
face
there
was
no
evasion
in
her
eyes
but
her
eyelids
quivered
it
all
right
audrey
you
never
have
denied
that
you
love
me
and
you
ca
for
the
life
of
you
deny
it
now
she
did
not
attempt
to
for
the
entrance
of
the
footman
with
coffee
made
denial
indecent
at
the
moment
if
not
impossible
that
ex
from
below
the
stage
retired
unconscious
of
the
imminent
catastrophe
he
had
averted
but
he
had
brought
into
the
little
drama
a
certain
prosaic
element
coffee
and
romantic
passion
do
not
go
hand
in
hand
then
it
seemed
to
audrey
that
the
welcome
interval
of
commonplace
lapsed
into
a
dream
in
which
hardy
voice
went
sounding
on
in
interminable
monologue
i
shall
hear
the
wind
audrey
rushing
over
prairies
infinite
as
the
sea
i
shall
see
the
great
wall
of
the
rockies
rising
and
england
will
seem
like
a
little
piece
of
patchwork
with
a
pattern
of
for
mountains
and
brooks
for
rivers
and
when
i
set
our
canadian
farm
going
i
shall
hunt
big
game
and
when
i
exterminated
the
last
bison
off
the
face
of
the
boundless
prairie
i
shall
devote
myself
to
literature
literature
she
echoed
faintly
it
was
all
so
grotesquely
strange
that
even
this
announcement
brought
only
a
dreamlike
surprise
yes
literature
do
you
think
literature
is
only
produced
by
the
miserable
noodles
who
sit
in
their
studies
at
home
till
their
muscles
wither
and
their
hearts
get
flabby
book
will
be
a
man
book
with
a
man
blood
and
a
man
brains
in
it
it
will
be
a
book
that
will
make
posterity
sit
up
and
when
you
have
enjoyed
the
fame
of
it
a
little
we
go
out
again
together
in
canada
we
shall
find
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
she
sat
silent
and
passive
the
situation
had
a
charm
which
she
was
powerless
to
break
it
seemed
as
if
the
mere
brute
force
through
which
hardy
had
dominated
her
intellect
hitherto
had
become
refined
by
some
extraordinary
process
and
was
exerting
a
moral
influence
over
her
in
order
to
assert
herself
against
the
intolerable
fascination
she
rose
hastily
and
crossed
the
room
to
where
her
piano
stood
open
in
the
corner
she
played
loud
and
long
wild
polish
music
alive
with
the
beating
pulses
of
love
and
frenzy
and
despair
it
would
have
roused
another
man
to
sublime
enthusiasm
or
delirious
rapture
it
sent
hardy
to
sleep
stretched
on
the
hearthrug
with
slackened
jaw
and
great
chest
heaving
with
regular
rise
and
fall
he
slept
like
a
tired
dog
she
played
on
and
as
she
played
he
dreamed
that
he
stood
with
her
in
the
midst
of
the
burning
prairie
they
two
on
a
little
ring
of
charred
black
earth
an
island
in
a
roaring
sea
of
fire
the
ring
grew
smaller
and
smaller
till
they
could
only
find
by
clinging
close
together
as
he
turned
to
her
she
thrust
him
from
her
into
the
sea
of
fire
crying
it
perfectly
fair
vincent
for
you
dragged
me
here
against
my
will
he
woke
with
a
snort
as
the
music
suddenly
ceased
it
was
midnight
he
had
to
start
from
home
early
next
morning
and
if
he
delayed
longer
he
would
lose
the
last
train
out
he
parted
from
audrey
as
only
the
traveller
outward
bound
parts
from
his
betrothed
in
fact
as
she
remarked
afterwards
for
the
fuss
he
made
about
it
he
might
have
been
going
to
the
north
pole
with
his
life
in
his
hands
so
like
vincent
as
for
hardy
he
felt
already
the
wind
of
the
new
heaven
and
the
sweetness
of
the
new
earth
audrey
was
staring
abstractedly
into
the
when
she
heard
the
shut
with
a
violent
bang
and
the
sound
of
his
quick
footsteps
on
the
pavement
below
she
came
to
herself
with
a
cold
shiver
what
had
she
done
surely
she
had
not
gone
and
engaged
herself
to
vincent
bound
herself
in
the
first
year
of
her
liberty
to
a
man
she
had
known
all
her
life
and
her
own
cousin
too
it
was
impossible
for
you
see
it
would
have
argued
great
weakness
of
mind
and
a
total
want
of
originality
chapter
iii
whether
audrey
did
or
did
not
understand
herself
she
was
a
mystery
to
all
about
her
and
to
none
more
than
her
father
cousin
and
her
own
chaperon
miss
craven
this
unfortunate
lady
under
stress
of
circumstances
had
accepted
the
charge
of
audrey
after
her
death
and
had
never
ceased
to
watch
her
movements
with
bewildered
interest
and
surprise
the
most
familiar
phenomena
are
often
the
least
understood
and
miss
craven
intelligence
was
daily
baffled
by
the
problem
of
audrey
daily
she
renewed
her
researches
with
enthusiasm
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
natural
philosopher
but
hitherto
she
had
found
no
hypothesis
to
cover
all
the
facts
the
girl
was
either
a
rule
for
herself
or
the
exception
that
proved
other
people
rules
and
miss
craven
was
obliged
to
rest
satisfied
in
the
vague
conclusion
that
she
had
a
great
deal
of
character
strange
to
say
that
is
how
audrey
struck
most
of
her
acquaintance
though
as
yet
no
one
had
been
known
to
venture
on
further
definition
miss
craven
was
repaid
for
her
affectionate
solicitude
by
an
indifference
none
the
less
galling
because
evidently
unstudied
audrey
rather
liked
her
chaperon
than
otherwise
the
poor
old
thing
as
she
called
her
never
got
in
her
way
never
questioned
her
will
and
made
no
claims
whatsoever
on
her
valuable
time
besides
relieving
her
of
all
those
little
duties
that
make
us
wonder
whether
life
be
worth
living
under
the
present
dispensation
chaperons
were
a
necessary
evil
and
audrey
was
not
one
to
fly
heedlessly
in
the
face
of
her
providence
society
all
the
same
miss
craven
had
her
drawbacks
if
you
being
young
and
vivacious
take
a
highly
nervous
old
lady
and
keep
her
in
a
state
of
perpetual
repression
shutting
her
out
from
all
your
little
confidences
you
will
find
that
the
curiosity
so
natural
to
her
age
will
be
sure
to
burst
out
after
such
bottling
in
alarming
effervescence
as
soon
as
hardy
unmistakable
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
she
had
left
the
on
a
hint
from
audrey
in
her
room
above
she
had
heard
the
alternate
booming
and
buzzing
of
their
voices
prolonged
far
into
the
night
but
could
make
out
no
intelligible
sounds
to
ears
tingling
with
prophetic
apprehension
the
provocation
was
intense
the
old
lady
passed
a
restless
night
and
came
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
quivering
with
suppressed
excitement
audrey
face
did
not
inspire
confidence
and
it
was
not
until
she
had
touched
lightly
on
the
state
of
the
weather
and
other
topics
of
general
interest
that
miss
craven
darted
irrelevantly
to
her
point
my
dear
is
there
anything
between
you
and
your
er
cousin
mr
hardy
the
awful
question
hung
in
the
air
without
a
context
while
audrey
went
on
making
tea
this
she
did
with
a
graceful
and
deliberate
precision
completing
the
delicate
operation
before
answering
yes
there
is
a
great
deal
between
me
and
my
cousin
hardy
which
neither
of
us
can
get
over
there
was
a
freezing
finality
in
the
manner
of
the
reply
in
spite
of
the
smile
which
accompanied
it
and
even
miss
craven
could
not
fail
to
understand
she
bridled
a
little
wrapping
herself
closer
in
her
soft
shawl
as
in
an
impenetrable
husk
of
reserve
and
began
nervously
buttering
toast
the
whole
thing
was
very
odd
but
then
the
ways
of
audrey
were
inscrutable
audrey
herself
felt
an
unspeakable
relief
after
that
question
and
her
own
inspired
answer
last
night
she
had
possibly
been
ambiguous
at
any
rate
her
words
had
a
trenchant
force
which
severed
one
of
the
thousand
little
threads
that
bound
her
to
hardy
after
all
when
it
came
to
the
point
there
was
an
immense
amount
of
decision
in
her
character
and
as
the
days
went
on
and
hardy
with
them
leaving
league
after
league
of
the
atlantic
behind
him
the
load
at
her
heart
grew
lighter
and
when
at
last
the
letter
came
which
told
her
that
he
had
crossed
the
rocky
mountains
she
felt
with
a
little
tremor
of
delight
that
she
was
a
free
woman
once
more
her
world
was
all
before
her
vaguely
alluring
as
it
had
been
a
month
ago
the
letters
which
hardy
sent
from
time
to
time
had
no
power
to
destroy
this
agreeable
illusion
for
of
course
letters
were
bound
to
come
and
she
answered
them
all
with
cousinly
affection
as
she
would
have
answered
them
in
any
case
at
last
one
came
which
roused
her
from
her
indifference
for
it
had
a
postscript
by
the
way
there
a
miss
katherine
haviland
living
near
you
at
devon
street
pimlico
she
a
sort
of
little
of
mine
so
i
be
glad
if
you
go
and
look
her
up
some
day
and
be
kind
to
her
there
a
brother
knocking
about
somewhere
but
he
does
count
he
only
a
baby
ripping
sport
shot
a
moose
and
two
wapiti
this
morning
audrey
read
the
letter
with
languid
attention
she
was
not
in
the
least
interested
to
hear
that
he
had
taken
up
land
and
put
it
into
the
hands
of
an
agent
to
farm
she
was
tired
of
the
long
descriptions
of
canadian
scenery
and
the
tales
of
vincent
adventures
and
she
had
got
into
the
way
of
skipping
his
vain
repetitions
of
all
the
absurd
things
he
had
said
to
her
on
the
night
of
his
departure
but
the
postscript
stirred
strange
feelings
in
her
breast
his
mother
was
married
a
second
time
but
to
audrey
certain
knowledge
vincent
had
no
little
it
followed
that
for
some
reason
he
had
used
a
figure
of
speech
she
was
not
in
the
least
in
love
with
him
but
at
the
same
time
she
felt
all
the
dignity
of
her
position
as
empress
of
his
heart
and
could
bear
no
little
near
the
throne
she
would
certainly
look
miss
haviland
up
she
would
go
and
be
kind
to
her
that
afternoon
and
she
put
on
her
best
clothes
for
the
occasion
a
few
minutes
walk
brought
her
to
no
devon
street
one
of
a
row
of
gloomy
little
houses
full
of
dreadful
city
clerks
and
dressmakers
she
said
to
herself
in
a
flight
of
imagination
she
lifted
the
knocker
gingerly
in
her
white
gloved
hand
and
felt
by
no
means
reassured
when
she
was
shown
in
and
followed
the
servant
up
the
narrow
staircases
to
the
attics
as
she
neared
the
top
she
heard
a
voice
above
her
sounding
in
passionate
remonstrance
three
baths
in
the
one
blessed
dy
and
orful
did
ought
for
to
do
it
m
not
if
it
was
ever
so
here
the
voice
was
cut
short
by
a
mingled
roar
and
ripple
of
laughter
and
miss
audrey
craven
paused
before
announcing
herself
through
the
doorway
she
saw
a
girl
standing
before
an
easel
she
had
laid
down
her
palette
and
brushes
and
with
bold
sure
strokes
of
the
pencil
was
sketching
against
time
leaning
a
little
backwards
with
her
head
in
a
critically
observant
pose
the
voice
reasserted
itself
in
crushing
peroration
i
tell
you
wot
it
is
no
and
audrey
entrance
coincided
with
the
retreat
of
a
stout
woman
moving
slowly
with
an
unnatural
calm
the
girl
doubled
back
her
and
came
forward
apologising
for
the
confusion
face
to
face
with
the
object
of
her
curiosity
first
feeling
was
one
of
surprised
and
reluctant
admiration
miss
haviland
was
dark
and
pale
and
thin
she
was
also
a
little
too
tall
and
audrey
did
not
know
whether
she
quite
liked
the
airy
masses
of
black
hair
that
curled
high
up
from
her
forehead
and
low
down
on
it
in
crisp
tendrils
like
fine
wire
yet
but
for
her
nose
which
was
a
shade
too
long
a
thought
too
miss
haviland
would
have
been
beautiful
after
the
greek
type
audrey
own
type
as
she
had
once
described
it
in
a
moment
of
introspection
was
the
roman
therefore
she
made
that
admission
the
more
readily
there
was
a
touch
of
classic
grace
too
in
the
girl
figure
and
her
dress
she
had
rolled
up
the
sleeves
of
her
long
blue
overall
and
bound
it
below
her
breasts
and
waist
with
a
girdle
of
tape
not
for
the
sake
of
effect
as
audrey
supposed
but
to
give
her
greater
freedom
as
she
worked
and
moved
about
the
studio
at
this
point
audrey
found
out
that
all
miss
beauty
lay
in
the
shape
of
her
head
and
neck
with
that
nose
she
might
be
interesting
but
could
never
be
beautiful
in
fact
her
mouth
was
too
firm
and
her
chin
stuck
out
too
much
even
for
moderate
prettiness
audrey
did
not
arrive
at
these
conclusions
in
the
gradual
manner
here
set
forth
the
total
impression
was
photographed
on
her
sensitive
feminine
brain
by
the
instantaneous
process
and
with
the
same
comprehensive
rapidity
she
began
to
take
in
the
details
of
her
surroundings
the
attic
was
long
and
had
one
window
to
the
west
and
another
to
the
north
under
the
roof
looking
over
the
leads
at
the
far
end
were
a
plain
square
table
and
a
corner
cupboard
that
was
the
and
the
pantry
before
the
fireplace
were
a
small
persian
rug
bounded
by
a
revolving
a
bamboo
couch
a
palm
fern
a
that
was
the
library
and
all
the
remaining
space
was
the
studio
and
amongst
easels
stacks
of
canvases
draperies
and
general
litter
a
few
casts
from
the
antique
gleamed
from
their
corners
from
these
rapid
observations
audrey
concluded
that
miss
haviland
was
poor
you
were
busy
when
i
came
in
she
asked
sweetly
no
i
was
only
taking
a
hurried
sketch
from
the
life
it
not
often
that
our
landlady
exhibits
herself
in
that
sublime
mood
so
i
seized
the
opportunity
and
i
interrupted
you
no
you
interrupted
rogers
for
which
we
were
much
obliged
she
might
have
sat
for
us
longer
than
we
liked
i
am
very
pleased
to
see
you
certainly
audrey
was
a
pleasant
sight
there
was
no
critical
afterthought
in
the
admiring
look
which
miss
haviland
turned
on
her
visitor
and
audrey
felt
to
her
this
feminine
homage
to
compel
another
woman
to
admire
you
is
always
a
triumph
besides
miss
haviland
was
an
artist
and
her
admiration
was
worth
something
it
was
like
having
the
opinion
of
an
expert
audrey
pondered
for
a
moment
with
her
head
at
a
becoming
angle
for
she
had
not
yet
accounted
for
herself
my
cousin
vincent
hardy
asked
me
to
call
on
you
i
believe
he
is
a
very
old
friend
of
yours
yes
we
have
known
each
other
since
we
were
children
what
do
you
think
of
his
going
out
to
canada
to
farm
i
did
know
he
had
gone
then
vincent
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
say
to
his
little
so
far
so
good
oh
did
you
he
went
six
weeks
ago
i
never
heard
it
an
unlikely
thing
for
him
to
do
but
that
the
sort
of
thing
he
always
did
do
he
hated
going
poor
fellow
he
came
to
say
to
me
the
night
before
he
went
and
he
was
in
a
dreadful
state
i
heard
from
him
every
week
since
he
sailed
and
he
promised
to
send
me
some
bearskins
is
it
nice
of
him
she
wo
like
miss
haviland
assented
gravely
but
her
eyes
smiled
i
suppose
you
seen
a
good
deal
of
vincent
he
wrote
to
me
about
you
from
the
rocky
mountains
did
he
we
used
to
be
a
good
deal
together
when
we
were
little
since
then
we
have
been
the
best
of
friends
which
means
that
we
ignore
each
other
existence
with
the
most
perfect
understanding
in
the
world
i
always
liked
vincent
this
was
reassuring
miss
haviland
manner
was
candour
itself
and
depend
upon
it
if
there
had
been
any
about
her
audrey
would
have
found
it
out
at
once
she
dropped
the
subject
and
looked
about
her
for
another
the
suggestions
of
the
place
were
obvious
i
see
you
are
a
great
artist
my
cousin
did
prepare
me
for
that
miss
haviland
laughed
vincent
is
probably
unaware
of
the
interesting
fact
like
the
rest
of
the
world
that
picture
is
very
beautiful
may
i
look
at
it
said
audrey
going
up
to
the
easel
certainly
it
hardly
finished
yet
and
i
do
think
it
will
be
particularly
beautiful
when
it
is
i
ca
choose
my
subjects
it
looks
interesting
murmured
audrey
fatuously
what
the
subject
after
all
have
you
done
many
others
yes
a
good
many
may
i
she
hesitated
wondering
whether
her
request
might
not
be
a
social
solecism
like
asking
a
professional
to
play
if
you
care
about
pictures
i
will
show
you
some
of
my
brother
some
day
his
are
better
than
mine
more
original
at
least
your
brother
oh
of
course
vincent
told
me
you
had
a
brother
a
baby
brother
surely
miss
haviland
laughed
again
how
like
vincent
he
is
unconscious
of
the
flight
of
time
i
suppose
he
told
you
i
was
about
ten
years
old
but
you
must
really
see
the
baby
he
will
be
delighted
with
your
description
of
him
she
called
through
the
skylight
and
audrey
remembered
the
gentleman
who
was
no
gentleman
and
who
must
have
been
responsible
for
half
the
laughter
she
had
overheard
you
see
miss
haviland
explained
we
only
one
room
for
everything
so
ted
always
climbs
on
to
the
leads
when
we
hear
people
coming
bound
to
meet
them
on
the
stairs
if
he
makes
a
rush
for
the
bedrooms
if
any
bores
come
i
let
him
stay
up
there
and
if
it
any
one
likely
to
be
interesting
i
call
him
down
he
must
have
great
confidence
in
your
judgment
he
has
here
he
comes
audrey
looked
up
in
time
to
see
the
baby
lowering
himself
through
the
skylight
with
his
spine
curved
well
back
his
legs
hanging
within
the
room
and
his
head
and
the
upper
part
of
his
body
laid
flat
on
the
leads
outside
it
he
balanced
himself
for
a
second
of
time
it
was
a
most
undignified
position
but
he
triumphed
over
it
as
with
one
supple
undulation
he
shot
himself
on
to
the
floor
saving
his
forehead
from
the
window
by
a
after
this
fashion
ted
haviland
was
revealed
to
audrey
she
was
if
anything
more
surprised
by
his
personal
appearance
than
by
the
unusual
manner
of
his
entrance
the
baby
could
not
have
been
more
than
nineteen
or
twenty
and
there
could
be
no
dispute
as
to
his
beauty
nature
had
cast
his
features
in
the
same
mould
as
his
sister
and
produced
a
very
striking
effect
by
giving
him
the
same
dark
eyebrows
and
lashes
with
blue
eyes
and
a
mass
of
light
brown
hair
detractors
complained
that
the
type
was
too
feminine
for
their
taste
but
when
challenged
to
show
a
single
weak
line
in
his
face
they
evaded
the
point
and
laid
stress
on
the
delicate
pallor
of
his
complexion
not
that
it
mattered
for
ted
soon
made
you
think
as
little
of
his
good
looks
as
he
did
himself
but
audrey
never
forgot
him
as
she
first
saw
him
glowing
with
exercise
and
the
midday
bath
which
had
roused
his
landlady
indignation
i
extremely
sorry
he
began
airily
for
disappearing
in
that
rude
way
perhaps
i
ought
to
apologise
said
audrey
for
i
frightened
you
away
not
at
all
though
i
was
desperately
frightened
too
i
was
flying
before
rogers
when
you
came
in
you
probably
think
i
ought
to
have
braved
it
out
just
for
the
look
of
the
thing
especially
after
her
reflections
on
my
social
position
but
unfortunately
my
sister
has
imbued
that
terrible
woman
with
the
belief
that
art
ca
possibly
flourish
anywhere
outside
this
attic
of
hers
ever
since
then
she
kept
us
in
the
most
humiliating
subjection
i
do
want
you
to
think
badly
of
rogers
there
no
malice
about
her
she
would
raise
your
rent
suddenly
or
leave
pails
of
water
on
the
stairs
or
anything
of
that
kind
and
she
capable
of
really
deep
feeling
when
it
a
question
of
dinner
ted
if
you
forget
rogers
for
a
minute
i
told
miss
craven
that
you
would
show
her
some
of
your
sketches
and
things
some
day
all
right
we
have
the
exhibition
if
miss
craven
cares
to
stop
plenty
of
time
before
the
light
goes
audrey
hesitated
but
miss
haviland
had
moved
aside
her
own
easel
to
make
room
for
her
brother
she
seconded
his
invitation
and
miss
craven
stopped
three
months
ago
in
an
oxford
she
had
found
herself
absorbing
metaphysics
as
it
were
through
the
pores
of
her
skin
without
any
previous
discipline
in
that
exacting
science
now
in
a
london
studio
she
became
aware
of
a
similarly
miraculous
influx
of
power
yesterday
she
would
have
told
you
that
she
knew
nothing
about
art
and
cared
less
it
seemed
that
she
had
lived
in
its
atmosphere
from
her
cradle
and
learned
its
language
at
her
nurse
knee
but
though
familiar
with
art
she
was
not
prepared
for
the
behaviour
of
the
artist
ted
treated
his
works
as
if
he
were
the
last
person
concerned
with
them
he
would
pass
scathing
judgment
on
those
which
pleased
audrey
best
or
he
would
stand
like
a
deity
aloof
from
his
own
creations
beholding
them
to
be
very
good
and
not
hesitating
to
say
so
well
said
audrey
at
last
you
shown
me
a
great
many
lovely
things
but
which
is
your
masterpiece
they
were
all
masterpieces
when
i
first
finished
them
yes
but
seriously
which
do
you
consider
your
best
i
want
to
know
ted
hesitated
and
then
turned
to
a
stack
of
larger
canvases
i
wonder
she
murmured
if
shall
think
it
your
best
probably
not
why
not
ted
did
not
answer
he
hardly
liked
to
say
because
hitherto
you
have
persistently
admired
my
worst
this
he
said
laughing
as
he
lifted
a
large
canvas
on
to
the
easel
is
the
only
masterpiece
that
has
withstood
the
test
of
time
he
means
struck
in
his
sister
that
he
finished
it
a
week
ago
and
that
in
another
week
he
want
to
stick
a
knife
into
it
with
all
its
faults
the
picture
had
a
poetic
audacity
that
defied
the
criticism
it
provoked
if
you
looked
long
enough
you
saw
that
a
youth
and
a
maiden
were
lying
in
a
trance
that
was
half
sleep
half
death
while
their
souls
diaphanous
forms
with
indefinite
legs
hovered
above
them
in
each
leaning
towards
the
other
body
the
souls
described
two
curves
that
crossed
like
the
intersecting
of
rainbows
and
where
they
met
their
wings
mingled
in
a
confused
iridescence
eros
in
a
tunic
looked
on
with
an
air
of
studied
indifference
that
might
or
might
not
have
been
intended
by
the
painter
audrey
looked
helplessly
at
the
picture
she
could
not
understand
it
and
with
things
that
she
could
not
understand
she
always
felt
a
vague
impotent
displeasure
what
what
is
the
subject
she
gasped
at
length
a
metempsychosis
she
knitted
her
brows
and
said
nothing
transmigration
of
souls
why
did
i
say
so
at
first
returned
ted
in
cheerful
response
to
the
frown
so
i
see
but
what
apollo
doing
there
with
his
bow
and
arrows
and
why
is
he
all
in
red
it
not
meant
for
apollo
it
an
eros
i
beg
your
pardon
an
eros
love
a
very
inferior
order
of
deity
why
is
he
in
red
i
do
know
i
sure
his
taste
in
dress
always
was
a
little
loud
but
why
is
he
there
at
all
love
ca
you
see
i
ca
explain
if
it
not
obvious
he
er
he
be
there
audrey
looked
up
but
the
baby
was
not
looking
at
her
he
was
absorbed
in
his
masterpiece
she
flushed
and
pressed
one
little
pointed
boot
firmly
to
the
ground
yes
yes
i
see
that
but
i
ca
make
out
the
rest
of
it
ted
shook
his
head
helplessly
while
his
sister
laughed
at
his
discomfiture
please
do
mind
my
sister
said
he
nervously
flourishing
his
the
picture
represents
two
people
exchanging
souls
audrey
raised
her
eyebrows
those
are
the
souls
and
these
are
the
people
do
be
quiet
katherine
it
a
perfectly
conceivable
transaction
though
i
own
it
might
be
a
very
bad
bargain
for
some
i
would
like
to
swop
souls
with
my
sister
for
instance
she
has
any
imagination
audrey
gave
a
little
shudder
what
a
curious
idea
it
makes
me
feel
quite
creepy
but
i
sure
i
never
lose
my
sense
of
personal
identity
my
individuality
is
too
strong
or
something
and
then
what
love
got
to
do
with
it
what
does
it
all
mean
obviously
that
love
is
master
of
the
ceremonies
at
every
metempsychosis
said
katherine
i
see
audrey
lay
back
in
her
chair
and
gazed
dreamily
at
the
painting
while
the
painter
gazed
at
her
was
he
trying
to
find
out
the
secret
of
that
individuality
audrey
turned
to
katherine
with
her
radiant
smile
do
you
paint
like
this
too
no
i
a
ah
that
means
that
you
rather
paint
what
you
see
it
means
that
i
have
to
paint
a
great
deal
that
i
rather
not
see
but
your
brother
is
an
idealist
are
you
mr
haviland
probably
i
always
noticed
that
when
people
call
you
an
idealist
it
a
polite
way
of
saying
you
a
failure
i
may
be
an
idealist
i
do
know
and
i
afraid
i
do
much
care
i
sure
you
do
care
and
you
have
your
ideals
oh
as
for
that
i
kept
as
many
as
seven
of
them
at
a
time
but
i
never
could
tame
them
and
when
it
comes
to
taking
their
portraits
the
things
do
know
how
to
sit
properly
look
at
that
woman
soul
for
instance
and
ted
pointed
to
his
masterpiece
with
disgust
why
what
wrong
with
it
it
beautiful
yes
i
got
on
all
right
with
the
upper
half
but
as
you
see
i
been
a
little
unfortunate
with
the
feet
and
legs
of
course
interrupted
katherine
because
you
got
tired
of
the
whole
thing
that
what
a
man
idealism
comes
to
audrey
looked
up
with
a
quick
sidelong
glance
and
what
does
a
woman
idealism
come
to
generally
to
this
that
she
tried
to
paint
her
own
portrait
large
with
a
big
brush
and
made
a
mess
of
the
canvas
there
was
a
sad
inflection
in
the
girl
voice
and
she
looked
away
as
she
spoke
the
look
and
the
tone
were
details
that
lay
beyond
the
range
of
audrey
observation
and
she
felt
hurt
though
she
hardly
knew
why
she
rose
carefully
adjusting
her
veil
and
the
lace
about
her
throat
i
adore
idealists
i
ca
help
it
i
made
that
way
you
see
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
delicate
deprecation
of
the
decrees
of
fate
katherine
did
not
see
but
she
went
down
with
miss
craven
to
the
door
ted
had
proposed
tea
on
the
leads
and
audrey
had
agreed
that
it
would
have
been
charming
idyllic
if
she
could
have
stayed
but
she
had
looked
at
the
skylight
and
then
at
her
own
closely
fitting
gown
and
propriety
her
guardian
angel
had
suggested
that
she
had
better
not
ted
said
katherine
an
hour
later
i
got
an
idea
what
a
magnificent
model
miss
craven
would
make
ted
made
no
answer
but
he
flung
his
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
it
took
apollo
neatly
in
the
eye
i
failed
miserably
in
my
rogers
said
he
and
went
off
for
solitary
contemplation
on
the
leads
katherine
picked
up
the
book
and
looked
at
it
he
failed
in
his
rogers
but
in
a
corner
of
a
fresh
page
he
had
made
a
little
sketch
of
a
face
and
figure
which
were
not
those
of
rogers
and
that
was
a
failure
too
chapter
iv
there
was
a
certain
truth
in
hardy
description
of
ted
haviland
ted
had
all
a
baby
fascination
a
baby
irresponsibility
and
a
rigid
tenacity
of
purpose
there
perhaps
the
likeness
ended
at
any
rate
ted
had
contrived
to
plan
a
career
for
himself
at
the
age
of
seven
had
said
nothing
about
it
for
ten
years
and
then
quietly
carried
it
through
in
spite
of
circumstances
and
the
influential
members
of
his
family
these
powers
had
been
against
him
from
the
first
his
mother
had
died
in
giving
him
birth
and
as
his
father
chose
to
hold
him
directly
responsible
for
the
tragedy
his
early
years
were
passed
somewhat
under
a
cloud
katherine
was
his
only
comfort
and
stay
the
girl
had
five
years
the
start
of
him
which
gave
her
an
enormous
advantage
in
dealing
with
the
uncertain
details
of
life
her
method
was
simplicity
itself
it
was
summed
up
in
the
golden
rule
take
your
own
way
first
and
then
let
other
people
take
theirs
it
was
in
this
spirit
that
mounted
on
a
table
she
painted
the
great
that
covered
the
north
wall
of
the
nursery
and
with
equal
heroism
she
met
the
unrighteous
nemesis
that
waits
upon
mortal
success
and
skipped
off
to
bed
at
three
in
the
afternoon
as
if
to
a
ted
worshipped
his
sister
because
of
her
courage
and
resource
because
of
her
fuzzy
black
hair
cut
short
like
a
boy
for
the
strength
of
her
long
limbs
and
for
a
hundred
other
reasons
and
katherine
loved
ted
with
a
passion
all
the
more
intense
because
he
was
the
only
creature
she
knew
that
would
let
itself
be
loved
comfortably
for
papa
was
an
abstraction
and
nurse
erred
on
the
opposite
extreme
being
a
terribly
concrete
reality
with
a
great
many
acute
angles
about
her
which
was
a
drawback
to
demonstrations
of
affection
one
day
katherine
mixed
some
colours
for
ted
and
taught
him
how
to
manage
a
pencil
and
that
was
just
before
she
went
to
school
and
then
ted
said
to
himself
i
too
will
paint
and
he
painted
them
in
season
and
out
of
season
and
was
obliged
to
hide
them
away
in
drawers
and
cupboards
and
places
for
there
was
no
one
to
care
for
them
now
that
kathy
was
gone
as
for
that
headstrong
young
person
her
method
was
so
far
successful
that
when
she
was
eighteen
it
began
to
be
rumoured
in
the
family
that
katherine
would
do
great
things
but
that
ted
was
an
idle
young
beggar
the
boy
had
shown
no
talent
for
anything
in
particular
and
nobody
had
thought
of
his
future
not
katherine
she
was
too
busy
with
her
own
and
certainly
not
his
father
who
at
the
best
of
times
lived
piously
in
the
past
with
the
memory
of
his
dead
wife
and
was
day
by
day
loosening
his
hold
upon
the
present
for
ted
papa
became
more
and
more
an
abstraction
until
a
higher
power
withdrew
him
altogether
from
earthly
affairs
haviland
had
lived
in
a
melancholy
gentility
on
a
pension
which
died
with
him
and
at
his
death
the
children
were
left
with
nothing
but
the
pittance
they
inherited
from
their
mother
when
the
family
met
in
solemn
conclave
to
decide
the
fate
of
katherine
and
ted
it
learned
that
katherine
true
to
her
old
principles
had
taken
the
decision
into
her
own
hands
she
meant
to
live
for
art
and
by
art
and
uncle
james
was
much
mistaken
if
he
thought
that
an
expensive
training
was
to
be
flung
away
upon
a
niggling
amateur
at
any
rate
she
had
taken
a
studio
in
pimlico
and
furnished
it
and
as
she
had
come
of
age
yesterday
there
was
really
no
more
to
be
said
ted
of
course
would
live
with
her
and
choose
his
own
profession
but
ted
profession
was
not
so
easily
chosen
the
boy
had
brought
a
perfectly
open
mind
to
the
subject
and
discussed
the
reasons
for
and
against
the
church
the
bar
the
bank
and
a
trade
with
admirable
clearness
and
impartiality
but
when
invited
to
make
a
selection
from
among
the
four
he
betrayed
no
enthusiasm
finally
he
was
asked
if
he
had
any
objection
to
the
medical
profession
and
replied
that
he
had
none
having
indeed
never
thought
about
it
on
the
whole
he
considered
that
the
idea
was
not
a
bad
one
and
he
would
try
it
he
tried
it
for
a
year
and
a
half
but
not
altogether
with
success
he
had
been
advised
to
take
up
surgery
for
a
great
man
had
noticed
his
long
sensitive
fingers
and
told
him
that
he
had
the
hands
of
a
born
surgeon
he
managed
to
get
through
the
hours
in
the
standing
on
his
head
from
time
to
time
as
a
precaution
against
faintness
but
his
heroism
gave
way
before
the
horrors
of
the
theatre
soon
with
indignation
naturally
mingled
with
pleasure
at
this
fulfilment
of
its
own
predictions
the
family
heard
that
ted
had
flung
up
the
medical
profession
that
the
boy
had
the
hands
of
a
born
surgeon
was
considered
to
be
an
aggravation
of
his
offence
it
constituted
it
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
when
ted
drew
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
had
passed
first
in
comparative
anatomy
his
uncle
james
told
him
that
stupidity
was
excusable
and
that
his
abilities
only
proved
him
a
lazy
fellow
he
then
offered
him
a
berth
in
his
office
with
board
and
lodging
in
his
own
house
and
as
ted
was
in
low
water
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
accept
james
pigott
remained
master
of
the
situation
without
a
suspicion
of
its
pathetic
irony
ted
whose
intellect
was
incapable
of
adding
two
and
two
together
had
to
sit
on
a
high
stool
and
work
endless
sums
in
arithmetic
ted
whose
soul
was
married
to
ideal
beauty
had
to
live
in
a
house
where
every
object
had
the
same
unwinking
ugliness
and
where
the
cook
was
the
only
artist
whose
genius
was
appreciated
ted
was
a
little
bit
of
a
stoic
and
he
could
have
borne
the
long
impressive
dinners
and
the
unstudied
malice
of
the
furniture
if
only
his
uncle
would
have
let
him
alone
but
pigott
was
nothing
if
not
conscientious
and
now
that
he
had
him
under
his
thumb
he
made
superhuman
efforts
to
understand
his
nephew
character
and
to
win
his
confidence
the
poor
gentleman
might
just
as
well
have
tried
to
understand
the
character
of
an
asymptote
or
to
win
the
confidence
of
a
and
nothing
but
misery
can
come
of
it
when
a
city
merchant
born
without
even
a
rudimentary
sense
of
humour
suddenly
determines
to
cultivate
that
gift
for
the
benefit
of
a
boy
who
can
detect
humour
in
the
wording
of
an
invoice
well
he
never
knew
how
it
happened
his
mind
might
have
been
running
on
an
illustrated
edition
of
the
cash
accounts
of
pigott
but
at
last
ted
made
an
arithmetical
blunder
so
unprecedented
so
astounding
that
a
commercial
career
was
closed
to
him
for
ever
stupidity
is
excusable
said
uncle
james
if
you
had
been
stupid
i
would
have
forgiven
you
but
you
have
ability
enough
sir
and
it
follows
that
you
are
careless
criminally
careless
and
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
and
like
pilate
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
so
it
happened
that
as
katherine
was
putting
the
last
touches
to
her
great
picture
the
witch
of
atlas
and
to
her
sketch
of
an
elaborate
future
fate
stepped
in
and
altered
all
her
arrangements
she
called
it
fate
for
she
never
could
bring
herself
to
say
it
was
ted
for
months
she
had
been
living
in
a
dream
in
which
she
was
no
longer
a
poor
artist
toiling
in
a
london
garret
she
was
on
the
highest
peak
of
atlas
in
the
land
where
as
you
know
dreams
last
forever
where
the
light
comes
down
unfiltered
through
the
transcendental
air
and
where
owing
to
the
unmelting
ice
and
snow
the
shadows
are
always
colours
to
live
for
art
and
by
art
she
had
not
yet
realised
the
incompatibility
of
these
two
aims
for
katherine
was
as
uncompromising
in
this
as
in
everything
else
and
refused
to
work
in
a
liberal
and
enlightened
spirit
she
believed
that
beauty
is
the
only
right
or
possible
or
conceivable
aim
of
the
artist
and
she
was
ready
to
sacrifice
a
great
deal
for
this
belief
for
this
she
slept
and
worked
in
one
room
which
she
left
bare
of
all
but
necessary
furniture
under
which
head
in
defiance
of
all
laws
of
political
economy
she
included
a
small
pantheon
of
plaster
deities
for
this
she
stinted
herself
in
everything
except
air
and
exercise
which
were
cheap
and
for
this
she
refused
to
join
housekeeping
with
her
cousin
nettie
thereby
giving
lasting
offence
to
an
influential
branch
of
the
family
at
the
end
of
three
years
she
had
begun
to
hope
and
to
feel
the
quickening
of
new
powers
and
as
her
nature
expanded
her
art
took
on
a
subtler
quality
a
subdued
and
delicate
sensuousness
which
it
must
be
owned
had
very
little
in
common
with
the
flesh
and
blood
of
ordinary
humanity
she
was
painting
steadily
in
a
pallid
fervour
of
concentrated
excitement
the
ease
of
her
pliant
hands
contrasting
with
her
firm
lips
and
knitted
brows
when
ted
burst
into
the
studio
with
a
thin
gladstone
bag
in
one
hand
and
a
fat
portfolio
in
the
other
his
face
told
her
of
a
crisis
in
his
history
it
was
humorous
pathetic
deprecating
and
determined
all
at
once
not
the
face
of
a
boy
dropping
in
casually
at
when
asked
if
anything
had
gone
wrong
at
the
office
he
replied
probably
by
this
time
they
lost
their
brightest
ornament
this
morning
you
see
they
said
among
other
things
that
it
was
the
least
use
my
stopping
as
i
had
any
head
for
figures
which
was
odd
considering
that
it
just
with
figures
i
been
most
successful
but
katherine
was
to
judge
for
herself
he
sat
down
leisurely
and
began
untying
his
portfolio
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
witch
of
atlas
that
going
to
be
a
stunning
picture
kathy
said
he
he
stood
before
the
canvas
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
abruptly
away
when
he
looked
at
katherine
again
his
face
was
set
and
a
little
flushed
he
seemed
to
be
making
a
calculation
a
thing
he
had
always
some
difficulty
in
doing
you
been
at
it
practically
all
your
life
but
it
took
you
one
two
three
five
years
real
hard
work
did
it
before
you
could
paint
like
that
yes
ted
five
years
hard
labour
with
costs
it
take
me
four
thank
heaven
i
learnt
anatomy
katherine
said
nothing
she
had
opened
the
portfolio
and
spread
out
the
drawings
and
was
hanging
over
them
in
amazement
how
when
and
where
the
boy
had
done
the
things
she
could
not
imagine
there
were
finished
studies
in
anatomy
of
heads
and
limbs
in
every
conceivable
attitude
there
were
shilling
crammed
with
illustrations
of
most
possible
subjects
and
some
impossible
ones
loose
sketches
done
on
the
backs
of
envelopes
the
of
books
and
fearful
revelation
of
artistic
depravity
the
ruled
pages
of
ledgers
and
in
every
one
of
them
there
was
power
and
wild
exuberant
vitality
it
was
genius
rampant
and
undisciplined
but
unmistakable
and
she
told
him
so
her
first
feeling
sent
the
blood
to
her
cheeks
for
pure
joy
her
second
drove
it
back
to
her
heart
again
katherine
was
one
of
those
people
who
can
see
a
thing
instantly
in
all
its
possible
bearings
and
at
the
present
moment
she
saw
clearly
not
only
that
ted
was
a
genius
but
that
his
genius
had
everything
to
learn
and
that
it
would
take
the
whole
of
his
tiny
income
to
teach
it
while
the
necessities
of
his
board
and
lodging
in
the
meanwhile
would
more
than
double
her
own
expenses
she
saw
herself
doomed
to
the
production
of
an
unbroken
succession
of
and
for
the
next
few
years
at
least
ted
career
was
only
possible
at
the
sacrifice
of
her
own
yes
she
said
at
last
sitting
down
and
tying
the
strings
of
the
portfolio
tenderly
you
have
to
work
hard
for
four
or
five
years
or
so
and
then
you
have
to
wait
art
is
long
you
know
and
high
art
the
longest
of
all
and
when
she
told
him
that
it
would
be
a
great
help
to
her
if
they
clubbed
together
ted
actually
believed
her
so
unaware
was
he
of
the
complexities
of
life
katherine
understood
why
ted
had
gone
to
guy
hospital
but
when
she
asked
him
idiot
why
he
had
wasted
a
year
at
his
uncle
office
he
said
that
he
wanted
to
prove
to
his
uncle
pigott
limited
capacity
that
he
was
utterly
incapable
of
managing
anybody
business
but
his
own
katherine
asked
no
more
questions
for
she
was
trying
to
think
then
when
she
had
done
thinking
she
took
the
witch
and
turned
her
with
her
face
to
the
wall
and
when
she
looked
at
ted
again
it
was
with
a
choking
sensation
and
for
the
first
time
for
three
years
she
was
aware
that
she
had
a
heart
beating
under
the
blue
overall
she
had
come
down
from
atlas
faster
than
she
had
gone
up
after
all
the
climate
there
is
frightfully
cold
and
there
are
passes
on
that
lonely
mountain
which
overhang
the
bottomless
pit
where
some
have
perished
very
miserably
katherine
had
escaped
the
abyss
and
left
behind
her
the
dreams
and
the
golden
mists
and
the
starry
peaks
of
ice
it
was
dark
in
the
studio
and
a
voice
was
heard
inquiring
whether
the
young
gentleman
was
going
to
stay
for
supper
if
a
bysin
of
hoatmeal
porridge
y
enuff
for
one
rogers
was
great
in
the
argument
chapter
v
audrey
had
never
been
able
to
enjoy
the
friendship
of
her
own
sex
for
more
than
ten
minutes
at
a
time
her
own
society
bored
her
inexpressibly
and
that
of
the
women
she
had
known
hitherto
was
uninteresting
because
it
was
like
her
own
but
katherine
was
unlike
all
other
women
and
she
had
taken
audrey
fancy
audrey
was
always
devising
pretty
little
excuses
for
calling
always
bringing
in
hothouse
flowers
or
the
last
hothouse
novel
which
katherine
positively
read
until
by
dint
of
a
naïve
persistency
she
won
the
right
to
come
and
go
as
she
pleased
as
for
katherine
she
considered
that
a
beautiful
woman
is
exempt
from
criticism
and
so
long
as
she
could
watch
audrey
moving
about
arranging
flowers
with
dainty
fastidious
touches
or
lying
back
on
the
couch
in
some
reckless
but
perfect
pose
she
reserved
her
judgment
she
rejoiced
in
her
presence
for
its
beauty
sake
she
loved
the
curves
of
her
limbs
the
play
of
her
dimples
the
shifting
lights
in
her
hair
but
she
had
to
pay
for
the
pleasure
these
things
afforded
her
and
man
time
became
a
frequent
item
in
the
account
katherine
had
set
her
heart
on
ted
studying
in
paris
for
six
months
and
was
trying
hard
to
make
enough
money
to
send
him
there
with
this
absorbing
object
in
view
she
herself
worked
equally
well
whether
audrey
were
in
the
studio
or
out
of
it
but
it
seemed
that
ted
powers
were
either
paralysed
or
diverted
into
another
channel
from
the
moment
she
came
in
the
baby
was
trying
to
solve
a
problem
which
had
puzzled
wiser
heads
than
his
but
he
had
no
clue
to
the
labyrinth
of
audrey
soul
he
was
not
even
certain
whether
she
was
an
intelligent
being
though
to
doubt
it
was
blasphemy
against
the
divine
spirit
of
beauty
his
researches
took
him
very
often
to
chelsea
gardens
and
most
of
his
spare
time
not
spent
there
was
employed
in
running
errands
to
and
fro
owing
to
these
distractions
his
nerves
became
quite
unhinged
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
began
to
show
signs
of
a
temper
he
had
been
full
of
the
paris
scheme
at
first
but
he
had
not
spoken
of
it
now
for
at
least
a
month
he
had
just
sat
down
for
the
twentieth
time
to
a
study
of
head
as
sappho
and
had
thrown
down
his
palette
in
disgust
exclaiming
what
the
use
of
keeping
your
mouth
still
if
your
confounded
eyes
giggle
when
a
note
arrived
from
miss
craven
you
ca
step
out
of
a
violent
passion
all
in
a
minute
and
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
why
ted
hands
trembled
a
little
as
he
tore
open
the
envelope
and
read
dear
haviland
do
come
over
at
once
i
in
a
dreadful
fix
and
want
your
advice
and
help
badly
i
would
ask
your
sister
only
i
know
she
is
always
sincerely
yours
audrey
craven
audrey
wrote
on
paper
in
the
bold
round
hand
they
teach
in
schools
she
had
modelled
hers
on
another
girl
and
she
signed
her
name
with
an
enormous
a
and
a
flourish
people
said
there
was
a
great
deal
of
character
in
her
ted
crammed
the
note
hastily
into
his
pocket
and
did
his
best
to
hide
the
radiance
of
his
smile
it
only
miss
craven
i
just
going
over
for
half
an
hour
i
be
back
for
tea
and
before
katherine
had
time
to
answer
he
was
gone
ted
first
thought
as
he
entered
miss
craven
was
that
she
was
in
the
midst
of
a
removal
the
place
was
turned
curtains
had
been
taken
down
ornaments
removed
from
their
shelves
pictures
from
their
hangings
and
the
grand
piano
stood
where
it
had
never
yet
been
allowed
to
stand
in
a
draught
between
the
window
and
the
door
tripping
over
a
persian
rug
he
saw
that
the
floor
was
littered
with
tapestries
and
rich
stuffs
of
magnificent
design
on
his
left
was
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
brass
and
copper
ware
on
his
right
a
heap
of
shields
and
weapons
of
barbarous
warfare
on
all
the
tables
and
cabinets
there
stood
an
array
of
venetian
glass
and
statuettes
in
bronze
marble
and
he
was
looking
about
for
miss
craven
when
that
lady
arose
from
a
confused
ocean
of
cushions
and
oriental
drapery
aphrodite
in
an
art
she
greeted
him
with
childlike
effusion
at
last
i
so
glad
you
come
i
was
afraid
you
might
help
me
out
of
this
somehow
i
simply
distracted
and
she
pointed
to
the
floor
with
a
gesture
of
despair
yes
but
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
why
to
offer
suggestions
advice
anything
only
speak
ted
looked
about
him
and
his
eyes
rested
on
the
grand
piano
is
it
a
ball
a
bazaar
or
an
auction
and
are
we
awake
or
dreaming
alive
or
dead
ca
you
see
mr
haviland
yes
i
see
a
great
many
things
but
what
does
it
all
mean
audrey
sank
on
to
an
ottoman
and
answered
slowly
and
incisively
looking
straight
before
her
it
means
that
i
sick
of
the
hideousness
of
life
of
the
excruciating
lower
arrangement
of
this
room
i
do
know
how
i
stood
it
all
these
years
my
soul
must
have
been
starved
stifled
i
want
to
live
in
another
atmosphere
to
be
surrounded
by
beautiful
things
laugh
like
that
i
know
i
not
an
artist
i
could
paint
a
picture
how
could
i
i
have
been
taught
but
i
know
that
art
is
the
only
thing
worth
caring
about
i
want
to
cultivate
my
sense
of
beauty
and
i
do
want
my
room
to
look
like
anybody
else
it
certainly
does
at
present
please
be
serious
you
not
helping
me
one
bit
look
at
that
pile
of
things
liberty
have
sent
me
first
of
all
i
want
you
to
choose
between
them
then
i
want
you
to
suggest
a
and
to
tell
me
the
difference
between
louis
quinze
and
louis
quatorze
i
remember
whether
it
do
to
mix
queen
anne
with
either
and
whether
would
you
have
old
oak
real
old
oak
or
chippendale
for
the
furniture
and
must
i
do
away
with
the
cosy
corner
ted
felt
his
head
going
round
and
round
artistic
delight
in
beauty
pagan
adoration
of
it
saintly
belief
in
it
the
first
tremor
of
crude
unconscious
passion
mingled
with
intense
amusement
reduced
him
to
a
state
of
utter
bewilderment
but
he
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
take
her
last
question
first
and
to
answer
authoritatively
certainly
a
cosy
corner
is
and
conventional
yes
it
is
i
not
in
the
least
conventional
and
i
do
think
and
i
want
my
room
to
express
my
character
to
be
a
bit
of
myself
so
give
me
some
ideas
you
do
mind
my
asking
you
do
you
you
the
only
artist
i
know
am
i
really
and
if
you
knew
six
or
seven
artists
what
then
why
then
i
should
ask
you
all
the
same
of
course
he
laughed
for
pure
pleasure
and
he
tried
to
dissemble
his
emotion
and
did
her
bidding
under
a
faint
show
of
protest
he
gave
his
vote
in
favour
of
venetian
glass
and
a
small
marble
diana
against
majolica
and
a
french
in
he
made
an
intelligent
choice
from
amongst
the
various
around
him
and
avoided
committing
himself
on
the
subject
of
louis
quatorze
on
one
point
audrey
was
firm
for
what
reasons
nobody
can
say
but
some
malay
creeses
had
caught
her
fancy
and
no
argument
could
dissuade
her
from
arranging
them
over
the
neapolitan
psyche
which
she
had
kept
at
ted
suggestion
the
gruesome
weapons
on
a
background
of
barbaric
gold
hung
above
that
pathetic
torso
like
a
fate
responsible
for
its
mutilation
audrey
was
pleased
with
the
effect
she
revelled
in
strong
contrasts
and
grotesque
combinations
and
if
liberty
had
sent
her
a
stuffed
monkey
she
would
have
perched
him
on
psyche
pedestal
i
know
a
man
said
ted
when
he
had
disposed
the
last
bit
of
drapery
according
to
an
ingenious
in
which
audrey
hair
sounded
a
brilliant
staccato
note
a
artist
who
was
asked
to
decorate
a
lady
room
what
do
you
think
he
did
he
made
her
take
all
the
pictures
off
the
walls
and
he
covered
them
over
with
little
halfpenny
japanese
fans
and
stuck
little
halves
and
quarters
of
fans
in
the
corners
and
under
the
ceiling
then
he
put
a
large
japanese
umbrella
in
the
fireplace
and
went
away
smiling
was
the
lady
pleased
immensely
she
asked
all
her
friends
to
a
japanese
in
robinson
room
the
rest
of
the
furniture
was
early
victorian
this
anecdote
was
not
altogether
to
audrey
taste
she
walked
to
a
shelf
where
ted
had
put
some
bronzes
looked
at
them
with
a
decided
air
of
criticism
and
arranged
them
differently
having
asserted
her
independence
she
replied
severely
your
friend
friend
must
have
been
an
extremely
silly
woman
not
at
all
she
was
a
most
intelligent
person
with
er
a
deep
sense
of
religion
and
now
haviland
you
making
matters
worse
you
care
nothing
about
her
religion
you
simply
think
her
a
fool
and
you
meant
that
like
her
else
why
did
you
tell
such
a
pointless
story
forgive
me
the
association
of
ideas
was
irresistible
you
like
her
in
your
utter
simplicity
and
guileless
devotion
to
an
ideal
he
looked
all
round
the
room
again
and
sank
back
on
the
sofa
cushions
all
limp
with
laughter
i
i
never
saw
anything
so
inexpressibly
sad
as
this
afternoon
work
it
heartrending
his
eye
fell
on
the
parisienne
dancing
inanely
on
her
pedestal
and
he
moaned
like
one
in
pain
audrey
mouth
twitched
and
her
cheeks
flamed
for
a
second
she
turned
her
back
on
ted
until
his
fit
had
spent
itself
dying
away
among
the
cushions
in
low
gurgles
then
there
was
silence
ted
raised
his
head
and
looked
up
she
was
still
standing
in
the
same
place
but
one
hand
was
moving
slowly
towards
her
pocket
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
faced
her
she
walked
to
the
window
convulsively
grasping
her
he
followed
her
miss
craven
dear
miss
craven
on
my
soul
i
swear
i
never
you
wo
you
believe
me
still
there
was
silence
and
an
averted
head
speak
ca
you
he
leant
against
the
window
and
began
to
giggle
again
audrey
turned
at
the
sound
and
looked
at
him
through
eyes
veiled
with
tears
her
lips
were
trembling
a
little
and
her
fingers
relaxed
their
convulsive
grasp
he
darted
forward
seized
her
hand
and
kissed
it
an
indefinite
number
of
times
exclaiming
incoherently
brute
hound
cur
that
i
am
forgive
me
only
say
you
forgive
me
i
know
i
not
fit
to
live
and
yet
how
could
i
tell
good
heavens
what
funny
things
women
are
here
he
took
possession
of
the
little
lace
and
wiped
her
eyes
very
gently
then
he
kissed
her
once
on
the
mouth
reverently
but
deliberately
to
do
audrey
justice
she
had
meant
to
sustain
her
part
with
maidenly
reserve
but
she
was
totally
unprepared
for
this
acceleration
of
the
march
of
events
she
said
nothing
but
went
back
submissively
to
her
sofa
hand
in
hand
with
ted
there
they
sat
for
a
minute
looking
rather
stupidly
into
each
other
faces
the
lady
was
the
first
to
recover
her
she
raised
her
hand
with
a
benedictory
air
and
let
it
rest
lightly
ever
so
lightly
on
ted
hair
my
dear
boy
she
murmured
i
forgave
you
all
the
time
now
there
is
nothing
that
will
dwarf
the
proportions
of
the
grand
passion
and
bring
you
to
your
sober
senses
sooner
than
being
patted
on
the
head
and
called
my
dear
boy
by
the
lady
of
your
love
ted
ducked
from
under
the
delicate
caress
and
rose
to
his
feet
with
dignity
his
emotion
was
spent
and
he
was
chiefly
conscious
of
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
every
object
in
that
ridiculous
room
accentuated
the
distasteful
humour
of
the
thing
psyche
looked
downcast
virgin
disapproval
from
her
pedestal
under
the
malay
creeses
and
the
frivolous
little
parisienne
flung
her
skirts
abroad
in
the
very
abandonment
of
derision
if
only
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
if
only
he
had
told
that
drivelling
story
about
the
japanese
umbrella
if
only
he
had
laughed
in
that
frantic
manner
and
if
only
but
no
he
could
not
look
back
on
the
last
five
minutes
the
past
was
a
grey
blank
but
the
flaming
episode
of
the
kiss
had
burnt
a
big
black
hole
in
his
present
consciousness
he
felt
that
by
that
rash
unpardonable
act
he
had
desecrated
the
holy
thing
and
with
it
all
had
forestalled
delayed
perhaps
for
ever
prevented
the
sanction
of
some
diviner
opportunity
if
he
had
only
waited
another
year
she
could
not
have
called
him
her
dear
boy
i
fully
aware
he
said
ruefully
that
i
behaved
like
a
idiot
and
i
better
go
no
you
shall
not
go
you
shall
stay
i
wish
it
sit
down
here
she
patted
the
sofa
beside
her
and
he
obeyed
mechanically
poor
poor
ted
i
forgive
you
we
will
never
misunderstand
each
other
again
never
and
now
i
want
to
talk
to
you
what
distressed
me
so
much
just
now
was
not
anything
that
you
said
or
thought
about
but
the
shocking
way
you
treat
yourself
and
what
is
best
in
you
ca
you
understand
it
you
know
how
i
believe
in
you
and
hope
for
you
and
it
was
your
affectation
of
indifference
to
things
which
are
a
religion
to
me
as
they
are
to
you
that
cut
me
to
the
heart
she
had
worked
herself
up
till
she
believed
firmly
in
this
little
fiction
yes
those
tears
were
tears
of
pure
altruism
tears
not
of
wounded
vanity
and
but
of
compassion
for
an
erring
genius
she
drew
back
her
head
proudly
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
then
she
continued
in
a
subdued
voice
with
a
certain
incisive
tremor
in
it
the
voice
that
is
usually
expressive
of
the
deeper
emotions
you
know
and
i
know
that
there
is
nothing
worth
caring
about
except
art
then
why
pretend
to
despise
it
as
you
do
and
katherine
every
bit
as
bad
as
you
are
she
encourages
you
i
know
what
perhaps
she
does
that
you
have
great
enthusiasms
great
ideals
but
you
are
unfaithful
to
them
you
laughed
at
me
you
know
you
did
i
did
from
ted
because
i
trying
to
make
my
life
beautiful
you
led
away
by
your
strong
sense
of
humour
till
you
see
something
ridiculous
in
the
loveliest
and
noblest
things
ted
eyes
wandered
in
spite
of
himself
to
the
little
lady
in
i
know
why
you
afraid
of
being
sentimental
but
if
people
have
feelings
why
should
they
be
ashamed
of
them
why
should
they
mind
showing
them
now
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
from
this
day
forth
you
take
yourself
and
your
art
seriously
that
you
work
hard
you
been
idling
shamefully
lately
oh
audrey
whose
fault
was
that
and
finish
some
great
picture
before
the
year
out
he
had
only
five
weeks
to
do
it
in
but
that
was
a
detail
now
promise
i
i
promise
anything
stammered
the
miserable
ted
if
only
you
look
at
me
like
that
sometimes
say
between
the
hours
of
seven
and
eight
in
the
evening
ridiculous
baby
now
we
must
see
about
the
pictures
we
just
time
before
tea
the
mention
of
tea
was
a
it
brought
them
both
back
to
the
world
of
fact
and
restored
the
familiar
landmarks
ted
solemnly
penitent
gave
his
best
attention
to
the
pictures
there
was
not
a
trace
of
his
former
abominable
levity
in
the
air
with
which
he
passed
sentence
on
each
as
audrey
brought
them
up
for
judgment
but
when
he
came
to
the
family
portraits
he
suspended
his
verdict
and
audrey
was
obliged
to
take
the
matter
into
her
own
hands
she
took
up
a
small
picture
in
a
square
frame
and
held
it
close
to
face
portrait
of
my
uncle
the
dean
of
benedict
what
shall
i
do
with
it
that
depends
entirely
on
the
amount
of
affection
you
feel
for
the
original
h
does
it
he
a
dear
old
thing
and
i
very
fond
of
him
but
what
do
you
think
of
him
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
she
stood
with
her
body
curved
a
little
backwards
holding
the
dean
up
high
in
a
good
light
her
attitude
was
so
lovely
that
it
was
impossible
to
disapprove
of
her
ted
reason
tottered
on
its
throne
and
he
laughed
which
was
perhaps
the
best
thing
he
could
have
done
he
is
not
strictly
speaking
handsome
no
said
audrey
i
afraid
he
have
to
go
she
knelt
down
beside
the
portrait
of
a
lady
it
was
evidently
the
work
of
an
inferior
artist
but
his
most
malignant
efforts
had
failed
to
disguise
the
beauty
of
the
face
it
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
audrey
but
it
was
the
face
of
an
older
woman
grave
intelligent
and
refined
by
suffering
i
been
obliged
to
take
this
down
she
said
as
if
apologising
more
to
herself
than
ted
because
i
want
to
hang
my
large
photo
of
the
sistine
madonna
in
its
place
what
is
it
it
my
mother
portrait
she
died
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
and
i
hardly
ever
saw
her
you
know
i
not
a
bit
like
her
he
stood
silent
watching
her
intently
as
she
spoke
family
portraits
she
continued
may
be
interesting
but
they
are
not
decorative
unless
of
course
she
added
hastily
being
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
peculiar
expression
of
ted
face
they
very
old
ones
lelys
and
sir
joshua
reynoldses
that
face
does
not
look
old
certainly
no
she
died
young
she
had
not
meant
to
say
that
a
little
shiver
went
through
her
as
the
words
passed
her
lips
and
she
felt
a
desire
to
change
the
subject
but
the
portrait
of
the
late
craven
was
turned
to
the
wall
along
with
the
dean
hullo
exclaimed
ted
taking
up
a
photo
in
a
glass
frame
here
old
hardy
what
on
earth
is
he
doing
here
audrey
blushed
but
answered
with
unruffled
calm
vincent
oh
he
a
family
portrait
too
he
my
cousin
first
cousin
you
know
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
i
i
hardly
know
she
took
the
photo
out
of
his
hands
and
examined
it
carefully
back
and
front
then
she
looked
at
ted
what
i
do
with
him
is
he
to
go
too
well
i
suppose
he
ought
to
he
all
very
well
in
his
own
line
but
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
he
not
exactly
decorative
poor
old
vincent
no
he
not
and
vincent
was
turned
face
downward
among
the
ruins
of
the
cosy
corner
and
audrey
and
ted
rested
from
their
labours
when
ted
had
gone
the
very
first
thing
audrey
did
was
to
get
a
map
and
to
look
out
the
rocky
mountains
there
they
were
to
be
sure
just
as
vincent
had
described
them
a
great
high
wall
dividing
the
continent
at
that
moment
hardy
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
of
his
little
shanty
busy
sorting
bearskins
and
thinking
of
audrey
and
bears
he
had
had
splendid
sport
that
is
he
had
succeeded
in
killing
a
grizzly
just
before
the
grizzly
killed
him
how
nervous
audrey
would
feel
when
she
got
the
letter
describing
that
encounter
then
he
chose
the
best
and
fluffiest
bearskin
to
make
a
nice
warm
cape
for
her
and
amused
himself
by
picturing
her
small
oval
chin
nestling
in
the
brown
fur
and
then
he
fell
to
wondering
what
she
was
doing
now
he
would
have
been
delighted
if
he
could
have
seen
her
poring
over
that
map
with
her
pencilled
eyebrows
knit
while
she
traced
the
jagged
outlines
of
the
rockies
with
her
congratulating
herself
on
the
height
of
that
magnificent
range
yes
there
was
a
great
deal
between
her
and
her
cousin
hardy
chapter
vi
one
fine
morning
in
latter
spring
about
four
months
after
the
day
of
the
transformation
scene
in
audrey
ted
haviland
was
lying
on
his
back
sunning
himself
on
the
leads
there
are
many
lovelier
places
even
in
london
than
the
leads
of
no
devon
street
pimlico
but
none
more
favourable
to
high
and
solitary
thinking
here
the
roar
of
traffic
is
subdued
to
a
murmur
hardly
greater
than
the
stir
of
country
woods
on
a
warm
spring
morning
a
murmur
less
obtrusive
because
more
monotonous
it
is
the
place
of
all
others
for
one
absorbed
in
metaphysical
speculation
or
cultivating
the
gift
of
detachment
the
very
have
a
remote
abstracted
air
the
slopes
of
the
slates
rise
up
around
you
shutting
you
in
on
three
sides
and
throwing
you
so
far
back
on
yourself
while
before
you
lies
the
vast
misty
network
of
roofs
stretching
eastward
towards
the
heart
of
the
city
and
above
you
is
the
open
sky
it
is
even
pleasant
here
on
a
day
like
this
a
day
with
all
the
ardour
of
summer
in
it
and
all
the
languor
of
spring
with
the
sun
warming
the
slates
at
your
back
and
a
soft
breeze
from
the
river
fanning
your
face
you
must
go
up
on
to
the
leads
on
such
a
day
to
feel
the
beauty
and
infinity
of
blue
sky
the
only
beautiful
and
boundless
thing
here
where
there
is
no
green
earth
to
rival
heaven
ted
had
certainly
no
taste
for
detachment
but
he
was
so
far
advanced
towards
metaphysical
speculation
that
he
was
engaged
in
an
analysis
of
sensation
off
and
on
ever
since
that
day
of
unreasonable
mirth
and
subsequent
madness
he
had
been
a
prey
to
remorse
he
had
kept
away
from
audrey
for
a
fortnight
during
which
time
his
imagination
had
run
riot
through
past
present
and
future
audrey
had
been
sweet
and
confiding
from
the
first
she
had
believed
in
him
with
childlike
simplicity
and
when
she
had
trusted
to
his
guidance
in
her
innocent
æstheticism
he
like
the
villain
that
he
was
had
made
fun
of
all
her
dear
little
arrangements
those
pathetic
efforts
to
make
her
life
beautiful
he
had
made
her
cry
and
then
taken
a
brutal
advantage
of
her
tears
to
ted
conscience
in
the
of
his
virgin
passion
that
premature
kiss
the
kiss
that
transformed
a
boyish
fancy
into
love
was
a
crime
and
yet
she
had
forgiven
him
all
the
time
she
had
been
thinking
not
of
herself
but
of
him
her
words
hardly
heeded
at
the
moment
came
back
to
him
like
a
dull
sermon
heard
in
some
exalted
mood
and
henceforth
transfigured
in
memory
she
had
done
well
to
reproach
him
for
his
frivolity
and
want
of
purpose
she
was
so
ready
to
say
pleasant
things
that
blame
from
her
mouth
was
sweeter
than
its
praise
it
showed
that
she
cared
more
by
this
time
he
had
forgotten
the
traits
that
had
impressed
him
less
pleasantly
happily
for
him
his
passion
for
audrey
was
at
first
altogether
bound
up
with
his
art
we
are
not
all
geniuses
but
to
some
of
us
once
perhaps
in
a
lifetime
genius
comes
in
the
form
of
love
to
ted
love
came
in
the
form
of
genius
quickening
his
whole
nature
and
bringing
his
highest
powers
to
a
sudden
birth
he
had
begun
and
almost
finished
the
work
which
audrey
had
urged
him
to
undertake
and
nobody
could
say
that
he
had
approached
his
subject
in
a
frivolous
spirit
it
was
a
portrait
of
herself
ted
had
been
rather
inclined
to
affect
the
romantic
antique
audrey
had
been
a
revelation
of
the
artistic
possibilities
of
modern
womanhood
and
he
turned
in
disgust
from
his
languid
studies
of
decadent
renaissance
or
renaissant
decadence
to
this
brilliant
type
one
corner
of
the
studio
was
stacked
with
sketches
and
little
portraits
of
audrey
audrey
from
every
point
of
view
audrey
in
a
black
gainsborough
hat
audrey
with
brown
fur
about
her
throat
audrey
in
billowy
silk
and
chiffon
audrey
as
she
appeared
at
a
dance
in
a
simple
frock
and
sash
and
audrey
in
a
gown
in
the
straight
lines
of
which
ted
professed
to
have
discovered
new
principles
of
beauty
in
fact
he
dreamed
of
founding
a
new
art
on
portraits
of
audrey
alone
from
which
it
would
appear
that
he
was
taking
himself
and
his
art
very
seriously
indeed
audrey
had
just
left
him
after
a
protracted
sitting
and
up
among
the
dreamy
he
was
reviving
in
fancy
the
sensations
of
the
morning
he
was
brought
back
from
his
ecstasy
by
katherine
voice
calling
ted
come
down
this
minute
i
got
something
to
show
you
and
rousing
himself
very
much
against
the
grain
he
dropped
languidly
into
the
room
below
katherine
had
come
in
all
glowing
with
excitement
she
pushed
back
her
hat
from
her
forehead
and
thrust
both
hands
into
her
bringing
out
two
loose
heaps
of
gold
there
she
said
letting
sovereigns
and
drip
on
to
the
table
with
an
impressive
chink
are
you
thankful
that
i
murdered
walking
through
the
great
sinful
city
with
all
that
capital
about
me
what
up
has
our
uncle
climbed
down
or
have
you
been
robbing
a
till
neither
i
been
to
the
bank
cashing
real
live
cheques

pounds

my

the
saint

home
fifteen
pounds
for
miss
maskelyne
prize
i
idealised

twenty
pounds
for
lady
stodart
prize
baby
total
forty
pounds
she
arranged
the
sovereigns
in
neat
little
piles
on
the
table
enough
to
take
you
to
paris
and
set
you
going
ted
started
and
his
face
fell
a
little
it
positively
my
only
dream
that
ever
came
true
picture
it
think
of
it
just
on
the
brink
of
it
you
can
start
next
week
if
you
like
ted
face
turned
a
deep
crimson
and
he
was
silent
then
audrey
promised
me
twenty
for
a
copy
of
the
botticelli
madonna
i
began
it
yesterday
that
be
enough
to
keep
you
on
another
month
if
you
want
it
and
bring
you
home
again
still
ted
said
nothing
he
sat
down
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
katherine
knelt
down
and
put
her
arm
tight
round
his
neck
ted
you
duffer
do
you
really
care
so
much
i
so
glad
i
know
you
take
it
that
way
he
drew
back
and
looked
her
mournfully
in
the
face
kathy
you
an
angel
it
awfully
good
of
you
but
i
i
ca
take
it
you
know
why
not
too
proud
no
rubbish
it
does
seem
an
infernal
shame
not
to
when
you
scraped
it
together
with
your
dear
little
paws
but
well
do
think
me
a
brute
i
do
know
that
i
want
to
go
to
paris
now
not
to
go
to
paris
no
idiot
kathy
which
botticelli
did
she
ask
you
to
do
for
her
the
one
you
got
so
excited
about
with
john
and
the
angel
side
opposite
you
as
you
go
in
come
i
can
see
through
that
trick
and
i
not
going
to
stand
any
nonsense
it
is
nonsense
it
is
why
you
were
raving
about
meissonier
last
year
yes
last
year
but
well
katherine
rose
and
gazed
at
him
with
the
austerity
of
an
inquisitor
ted
gave
an
uneasy
laugh
i
been
thinking
that
you
and
i
between
us
could
found
a
school
of
our
own
this
year
i
got
the
eccentricity
and
you
got
the
cheek
we
should
build
ourselves
an
everlasting
name
do
be
serious
i
shall
lose
my
temper
in
another
minute
is
it
the
wretched
money
you
thinking
of
no
it
is
the
money
altogether
he
got
up
and
walked
to
his
easel
then
oh
ted
you
know
that
paris
paris
in
may
must
be
simply
divine
why
do
you
go
yourself
no
no
that
not
the
same
thing
at
all
i
do
want
to
go
besides
i
ca
i
have
the
time
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
kathy
no
more
can
i
have
the
time
either
he
took
up
his
palette
and
brushes
and
began
carefully
touching
up
the
canvas
before
him
oh
h
she
stared
at
him
for
a
minute
in
silence
ted
looked
up
suddenly
their
eyes
met
and
he
set
his
face
like
a
flint
kathy
he
said
slowly
i
behaved
in
the
most
ungrateful
and
abominable
manner
i
should
like
to
go
to
paris
very
much
and
i
i
think
i
start
next
week
thank
you
dear
boy
it
the
very
least
you
can
do
and
they
dropped
the
subject
ted
was
the
first
to
speak
again
what
on
morning
kathy
national
gallery
for
me
she
looked
up
from
her
work
and
saw
ted
standing
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
gazing
with
an
agonised
expression
at
his
portrait
of
audrey
i
suppose
is
going
to
sit
again
well
yes
she
may
look
in
for
another
hour
in
the
morning
perhaps
ted
was
not
skillful
in
deceit
and
something
in
his
manner
told
katherine
that
the
sitting
somehow
depended
on
her
absence
she
began
to
see
dimly
why
he
had
been
so
frightened
at
the
idea
of
going
to
paris
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
you
have
made
the
corners
of
her
mouth
turn
up
enough
it
just
as
well
they
turn
up
too
much
no
they
do
that
what
makes
her
so
pretty
katherine
went
to
her
work
next
morning
in
anything
but
a
cheerful
spirit
she
had
set
her
heart
on
ted
studying
abroad
and
now
audrey
had
come
in
between
frittering
away
his
time
and
making
him
restless
and
unlike
himself
to
be
sure
his
powers
had
expanded
enormously
of
late
but
she
was
not
happy
about
him
and
was
half
afraid
to
praise
his
work
to
her
mind
there
was
something
feverish
and
unhealthy
in
its
vivid
beauty
it
suggested
genius
outgrowing
its
strength
if
audrey
really
had
anything
to
do
with
it
if
she
was
coming
in
any
way
between
him
and
the
end
she
dreamed
for
him
why
then
she
could
hate
audrey
with
a
deadly
hatred
that
was
what
she
said
to
herself
just
before
she
opened
the
and
found
audrey
standing
on
the
doorstep
looking
reprehensibly
pretty
in
a
gown
of
white
lawn
over
green
silk
her
wide
hat
was
trimmed
with
bunches
of
white
tulle
and
pale
green
poppies
and
she
had
a
little
basket
full
of
lilies
of
the
valley
hanging
from
her
wrist
you
wretch
she
cried
shaking
a
bunch
of
lilies
at
katherine
as
she
stood
in
the
narrow
passage
you
always
going
out
when
i
coming
in
and
you
always
coming
in
when
i
going
out
is
it
funny
audrey
said
nothing
to
that
but
she
kissed
katherine
on
both
cheeks
and
pinned
a
bunch
of
lilies
at
her
throat
with
a
little
gold
pin
that
she
took
from
her
own
dress
then
she
tripped
lightly
upstairs
with
a
swish
swish
of
her
silk
skirts
wafting
lilies
of
the
valley
as
she
went
katherine
watched
her
up
the
first
flight
and
the
hate
died
out
of
her
heart
after
all
audrey
was
so
perfect
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
that
moral
disapproval
seemed
somehow
beside
the
point
may
i
come
in
asked
audrey
tapping
at
the
open
door
of
the
studio
ted
rose
with
a
reverent
alacrity
very
much
as
you
rise
to
the
musical
parts
of
a
solemn
service
in
church
he
arranged
her
chair
carefully
with
soft
cushions
for
her
back
and
feet
if
you
do
mind
said
he
we
must
work
hard
for
i
want
to
finish
you
this
morning
or
perhaps
if
you
can
give
me
another
sitting
and
he
patted
a
cushion
and
held
it
up
for
her
head
you
can
have
any
number
of
sittings
said
audrey
ignoring
these
preparations
for
her
comfort
but
first
of
all
i
going
to
make
your
room
pretty
ted
dropped
his
cushion
helplessly
and
followed
her
as
she
moved
about
the
room
first
she
took
off
her
gloves
in
a
leisurely
manner
and
laid
them
down
among
ted
wet
brushes
then
she
began
to
arrange
the
lilies
of
the
valley
in
a
little
copper
bowl
she
found
on
the
chimneypiece
then
she
caught
sight
of
her
gloves
and
exclaimed
oh
look
at
my
beautiful
new
gloves
lying
among
your
nasty
paints
why
did
you
tell
me
you
horrid
boy
then
ted
and
she
tried
to
clean
them
with
turpentine
and
made
them
worse
than
ever
and
between
them
they
wasted
half
an
hour
of
the
precious
morning
after
that
audrey
took
off
her
hat
and
settled
herself
comfortably
among
the
cushions
she
drew
her
white
fingers
through
her
hair
till
it
stood
up
in
a
great
red
aureole
round
her
head
and
the
sitting
began
ted
heart
gave
a
bound
as
he
set
to
work
he
had
learnt
by
this
time
to
control
the
trembling
of
his
hands
otherwise
the
portrait
would
never
have
reached
its
present
perfection
he
had
painted
from
many
women
in
the
life
school
and
always
with
the
same
emotions
the
same
reverence
for
womanhood
and
the
same
delight
in
his
own
power
tempered
by
compassion
for
the
model
but
these
were
so
many
studies
in
still
life
compared
with
the
incarnate
loveliness
before
him
audrey
it
made
him
feel
giddy
to
paint
the
edge
of
the
ruffles
about
her
throat
or
the
tip
of
her
shoe
her
beauty
throbbed
like
pulses
of
light
it
floated
in
air
and
went
to
his
head
like
the
scent
of
her
lilies
he
had
reproduced
this
radiant
throbbing
effect
in
his
picture
it
was
a
head
the
delicate
oval
of
the
full
face
relieved
against
a
background
of
atmospheric
gold
into
which
the
golden
surface
tints
of
the
hair
faded
imperceptibly
the
eyebrows
were
arched
a
little
over
the
earnest
unfathomable
eyes
the
lips
were
parted
as
if
with
impetuous
breath
the
whole
head
leaned
slightly
forward
giving
prominence
to
the
chin
which
in
reality
retreated
a
defect
chiefly
noticeable
in
profile
ted
had
painted
what
he
saw
it
might
have
been
the
head
of
a
saint
looking
for
the
beatific
vision
it
was
only
that
of
an
ordinary
pretty
woman
as
a
rule
they
both
chattered
freely
during
the
sittings
this
is
of
course
necessary
if
the
artist
is
to
know
his
sitter
face
with
all
its
varying
expressions
and
audrey
had
given
ted
a
great
many
to
choose
from
this
morning
however
he
worked
steadily
and
in
a
silence
which
she
was
the
first
to
break
what
do
you
mean
by
talking
about
one
more
sitting
in
that
way
you
said
you
want
six
yesterday
i
did
but
he
leaned
back
and
began
tilting
his
chair
to
and
fro
the
fact
is
i
awfully
sorry
but
i
afraid
i
going
to
leave
england
the
young
rascal
had
chosen
his
words
with
a
deliberate
view
to
effect
and
audrey
first
thoughts
flew
to
america
though
not
to
hardy
she
moved
suddenly
in
her
chair
to
emigrate
you
with
your
genius
surely
not
no
rather
not
it
not
as
bad
as
all
that
but
i
afraid
i
have
to
go
to
paris
for
six
months
or
so
whatever
for
well
i
must
you
see
must
you
and
for
six
months
too
why
because
i
that
is
i
want
to
study
for
a
bit
in
the
schools
there
oh
she
leaned
back
again
among
her
cushions
and
looked
down
at
her
hands
clasped
demurely
if
you
want
to
go
that
another
thing
it
is
another
thing
and
i
do
want
to
go
as
it
happens
then
i
am
sure
you
need
go
and
study
what
can
they
teach
you
that
you
do
know
she
leaned
forward
and
looked
into
his
face
not
going
in
for
that
horrid
french
style
surely
well
i
some
thoughts
he
hesitated
and
audrey
took
courage
it
ca
be
it
must
be
oh
do
do
give
up
the
idea
for
sake
it
be
your
ruin
as
an
artist
she
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
was
gazing
at
him
appealingly
you
dear
little
thing
what
do
you
know
about
the
french
school
or
any
other
everything
i
take
in
art
and
i
read
all
the
magazines
and
things
and
i
know
all
about
it
you
do
know
anything
about
it
all
the
same
he
paused
biting
his
lip
all
the
same
what
if
i
thought
you
cared
a
straw
whether
i
went
or
stayed
have
i
shown
you
that
i
care
no
you
have
ted
audrey
made
that
little
word
eloquent
of
pleading
reproachful
pathos
but
he
went
on
for
heaven
sake
do
talk
any
more
rot
about
art
and
my
genius
anybody
can
do
it
do
you
think
that
what
i
want
to
hear
from
you
he
checked
himself
suddenly
i
beg
your
pardon
now
i
think
we
go
on
if
you
do
mind
sitting
a
little
longer
but
i
do
mind
either
you
very
rude
or
i
ca
understand
you
why
do
you
speak
to
me
like
this
she
had
picked
up
her
hat
and
begun
playing
with
its
long
pins
as
she
spoke
she
stabbed
it
savagely
in
the
crown
the
nervous
action
of
her
hands
contrasted
oddly
with
the
pensive
pose
of
her
head
but
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
turned
up
more
than
ever
and
the
tip
of
her
little
roman
nose
was
trembling
then
she
drew
the
pins
slowly
out
of
her
hat
and
made
as
if
she
would
put
it
on
ted
tried
to
reason
but
he
could
only
grasp
two
facts
clearly
that
in
another
second
she
would
be
gone
and
that
if
he
left
things
as
they
stood
he
would
have
to
exchange
london
for
paris
he
leaned
against
the
wall
for
support
and
looked
steadily
at
audrey
as
he
spoke
you
think
me
a
devil
and
i
can
only
prevent
that
by
making
you
think
me
a
fool
i
do
care
i
insane
enough
to
love
you
my
curious
behaviour
must
have
made
that
quite
obvious
if
you
say
that
you
care
for
me
a
little
bit
i
wo
go
to
paris
if
you
wo
i
go
and
stay
there
audrey
had
known
for
some
time
that
something
like
this
would
happen
she
had
meant
it
to
happen
from
the
day
she
first
saw
ted
haviland
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
be
his
destiny
and
yet
now
that
it
had
happened
though
ted
words
made
her
heart
beat
uncomfortably
fast
a
little
voice
in
her
brain
kept
on
saying
not
yet
not
yet
not
yet
she
sat
down
and
tried
to
collect
her
thoughts
ted
would
be
sure
to
begin
again
in
another
second
he
did
or
if
you
do
care
now
if
you
only
say
that
you
might
care
some
day
if
you
say
that
it
not
an
utter
impossibility
i
wo
go
i
wait
five
years
ten
years
on
the
off
chance
and
hold
my
tongue
about
it
too
if
you
tell
me
to
not
yet
not
yet
not
yet
audrey
she
started
as
if
a
stranger
had
called
her
name
suddenly
for
the
voice
was
not
like
ted
at
all
yet
it
was
ted
ted
in
the
shabby
clothes
she
had
seen
him
in
first
which
never
looked
shabby
somehow
on
him
but
it
was
not
the
baby
as
she
knew
him
he
was
looking
at
her
almost
defiantly
a
cloud
had
come
over
his
eyes
and
the
muscles
of
his
face
were
set
audrey
saw
the
look
of
unrelenting
determination
which
is
only
seen
to
perfection
in
the
faces
of
the
very
young
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
ted
had
taken
a
sudden
leap
into
manhood
audrey
he
said
again
and
their
eyes
met
she
tried
to
speak
but
it
was
too
late
the
boy
had
crouched
down
on
the
floor
beside
her
and
was
clasping
her
knees
like
a
suppliant
before
some
marble
divinity
do
ted
do
she
gasped
under
her
breath
i
wo
i
do
ask
you
to
do
it
now
before
i
made
my
name
it
may
take
years
but
i
shall
make
it
and
then
perhaps
she
tried
to
loosen
his
fingers
one
by
one
and
they
closed
on
her
hand
with
a
grip
like
a
dying
man
through
the
folds
of
her
thin
dress
she
could
feel
his
heart
thumping
obtrusively
and
the
air
throbbed
with
the
beating
of
a
thousand
pulses
her
brain
reeled
and
the
little
voice
inside
it
left
off
saying
not
yet
she
stooped
down
and
whispered
hurriedly
i
will
i
will
the
suppliant
raised
his
head
and
his
fingers
relaxed
their
hold
you
audrey
so
you
do
at
the
present
moment
i
do
it
was
my
fault
i
did
know
what
love
was
like
i
know
now
passion
is
absolutely
sincere
but
it
is
not
bound
to
be
either
truthful
or
consistent
what
has
it
to
do
with
trains
of
reasoning
or
with
the
sequence
of
events
in
time
past
and
future
history
are
nothing
to
it
for
audrey
it
was
now
now
now
all
foreshadowings
all
dateless
possibilities
were
swept
out
of
her
fancy
or
rather
they
were
crowded
into
one
burning
point
of
time
now
was
the
moment
for
which
all
other
moments
had
lived
and
died
life
had
owed
her
some
great
thing
and
now
with
every
it
was
paying
back
its
long
arrears
henceforth
there
would
be
no
more
monotony
no
more
measuring
of
existence
by
the
hands
of
the
clock
no
more
weighing
of
emotion
by
the
scruple
the
revelation
had
come
now
and
for
ever
it
was
all
the
same
for
sensation
that
knows
nothing
about
time
is
always
sure
of
eternity
chapter
vii
when
katherine
came
back
from
the
national
gallery
she
found
ted
alone
he
had
drawn
up
the
couch
in
front
of
his
easel
and
lay
there
gazing
at
his
portrait
the
restless
hungry
look
had
gone
from
his
eyes
there
was
no
triumph
there
only
an
absolute
satisfaction
and
repose
face
and
attitude
said
plainly
i
have
attained
my
heart
desire
i
am
young
in
years
but
old
in
wisdom
i
know
what
faith
and
hope
and
love
are
which
is
more
than
you
do
i
am
not
in
the
least
excited
about
them
as
you
see
i
can
afford
to
wait
for
these
things
last
for
ever
if
you
like
you
may
come
and
worship
with
me
before
my
heavenly
lady
image
but
if
you
do
you
must
hold
your
tongue
and
katherine
being
a
sensible
woman
held
her
tongue
but
she
took
up
a
tiny
pair
of
white
gloves
stained
with
paint
and
turpentine
that
lay
folded
on
the
easel
ledge
and
after
examining
them
critically
laid
them
on
ted
feet
without
a
word
a
faint
smile
flickered
across
his
lips
that
was
all
their
confession
after
some
inward
debate
katherine
determined
to
go
over
and
see
audrey
she
had
no
very
clear
notion
of
what
had
happened
that
morning
but
she
could
only
think
that
the
ridiculous
boy
had
proposed
to
audrey
and
been
accepted
the
idea
seemed
preposterous
for
though
she
had
been
by
no
means
blind
to
all
that
had
been
going
on
under
her
eyes
for
the
last
few
months
she
had
never
for
a
moment
taken
audrey
seriously
or
supposed
that
ted
in
his
sober
senses
could
do
so
either
this
morning
a
horrible
misgiving
had
come
over
her
and
she
had
gone
to
her
work
in
a
tumult
of
mixed
feelings
for
the
present
she
had
made
ted
career
the
end
and
aim
of
her
existence
what
she
most
dreaded
for
him
next
to
the
pain
of
a
hopeless
attachment
was
the
distraction
of
a
successful
one
a
premature
engagement
is
the
thing
of
all
others
to
blast
a
career
at
the
outset
what
good
was
it
she
asked
herself
passionately
for
her
to
pinch
and
save
to
put
aside
her
own
ambition
to
do
the
journeyman
work
that
brings
pay
instead
of
the
artist
work
that
brings
praise
if
ted
was
going
to
fling
himself
away
on
the
first
pretty
face
that
took
his
fancy
again
the
feeling
of
hatred
to
audrey
surged
up
in
her
heart
and
again
it
died
down
at
the
first
sight
of
its
object
audrey
was
standing
at
the
window
singing
a
little
song
to
herself
she
turned
as
the
door
opened
and
when
she
saw
katherine
she
started
ever
so
slightly
and
stood
at
gaze
like
a
frightened
fawn
she
was
attracted
by
katherine
as
she
was
by
every
personality
that
she
felt
to
be
stronger
than
her
own
among
all
artists
there
is
a
strain
of
manhood
in
every
woman
and
of
womanhood
in
every
man
katherine
fascinated
her
weaker
sister
by
some
such
charm
at
the
same
time
audrey
was
afraid
of
her
as
she
had
been
afraid
of
hardy
in
his
passion
or
of
ted
in
his
boisterous
mirth
there
were
moments
when
she
thought
that
katherine
direct
unquestioning
gaze
must
have
seen
what
she
hid
from
her
own
eyes
must
have
penetrated
the
more
or
less
artistic
disguises
without
which
she
would
not
have
known
herself
now
her
one
anxiety
was
lest
katherine
knew
or
guessed
her
treatment
of
vincent
and
had
come
to
reproach
her
with
it
owing
to
some
slight
similarity
of
detail
the
events
of
the
morning
had
brought
the
recollection
of
that
last
scene
with
hardy
uppermost
in
her
mind
she
had
persuaded
herself
that
her
love
for
ted
was
her
first
experience
of
passion
as
it
was
his
but
at
the
touch
of
one
awkward
memory
the
bloom
was
somehow
brushed
off
this
little
romance
for
these
reasons
there
was
fear
in
her
grey
eyes
as
she
put
up
her
face
to
katherine
to
be
kissed
do
you
know
she
half
whispered
has
he
told
you
no
he
has
told
me
nothing
but
i
know
there
was
silence
as
the
two
women
sat
down
side
by
side
and
looked
into
each
other
faces
katherine
instinct
was
to
soothe
and
protect
the
shy
creatures
that
shrank
from
her
and
audrey
in
her
doubt
and
timidity
appealed
to
her
more
than
she
had
ever
done
in
the
triumph
of
her
beauty
she
took
her
hand
caressing
it
gently
as
she
spoke
audrey
you
wo
mind
telling
me
frankly
are
you
engaged
to
ted
true
to
her
imitative
instincts
audrey
could
be
frank
with
the
frank
yes
i
am
but
it
our
own
little
secret
and
we
do
want
anybody
to
know
yet
perhaps
you
are
wise
she
paused
how
could
she
make
audrey
understand
what
she
had
to
say
she
was
not
going
to
ask
her
to
break
off
her
engagement
in
the
first
place
she
had
no
right
to
do
so
in
the
second
place
any
interference
in
these
cases
is
generally
fatal
to
its
own
ends
but
she
wanted
to
make
audrey
realise
the
weight
of
her
responsibility
audrey
she
said
at
last
do
you
remember
our
first
meeting
when
you
thought
ted
was
a
baby
yes
of
course
i
do
that
was
only
six
seven
months
ago
and
to
think
that
i
should
be
engaged
to
him
now
is
it
funny
very
funny
indeed
but
you
were
perfectly
right
he
is
a
baby
he
knows
no
more
than
a
baby
does
of
the
world
and
of
the
men
in
it
of
the
women
he
knows
rather
less
than
an
intelligent
baby
i
would
have
him
different
he
need
know
anything
about
other
women
so
long
as
he
understands
well
the
question
is
does
he
understand
himself
what
more
are
you
sure
you
understand
him
ted
is
two
people
rolled
into
one
and
very
badly
rolled
too
the
human
part
of
him
has
hardly
begun
to
grow
yet
he
got
no
practical
to
speak
of
and
only
a
rudimentary
heart
oh
katherine
quite
true
it
all
i
had
at
his
age
but
the
ideal
the
artistic
side
of
him
is
all
but
that
means
that
it
just
at
the
critical
stage
now
of
course
i
suppose
it
would
be
audrey
always
said
of
course
when
she
especially
failed
to
see
the
drift
of
what
was
said
to
her
yes
but
do
you
realise
all
that
the
next
few
years
will
do
for
him
that
they
will
either
make
or
ruin
his
career
as
an
artist
they
ought
to
be
years
of
downright
hard
work
of
solitary
hard
work
he
ought
to
have
them
all
to
himself
do
you
mean
to
let
him
have
them
audrey
lowered
her
eyes
and
sat
silent
playing
with
the
ribbons
of
her
dress
while
katherine
went
on
as
if
to
herself
he
is
so
young
so
dreadfully
young
it
would
have
been
soon
enough
in
another
ten
years
time
oh
audrey
why
did
you
let
it
come
to
this
well
really
katherine
i
could
help
it
besides
one
has
feelings
you
talk
as
if
i
was
going
to
stand
in
ted
way
as
if
i
did
care
a
straw
surely
his
career
must
mean
more
to
his
wife
than
it
can
to
his
sister
i
know
you
think
that
because
i
have
been
trained
like
you
because
i
lived
a
different
life
from
yours
that
i
ca
love
art
as
you
do
you
mistaken
to
begin
with
i
made
up
my
mind
ten
years
ago
that
whatever
i
did
when
i
grew
up
i
would
marry
a
nonentity
what
do
you
suppose
ted
fascination
was
if
it
was
his
genius
and
his
utter
unlikeness
to
anybody
else
geniuses
are
common
enough
nowadays
there
are
plenty
more
where
he
came
from
how
cynical
you
are
you
have
met
many
people
like
ted
have
you
no
i
have
oh
audrey
do
you
care
like
that
i
wonder
how
i
should
feel
if
i
were
you
and
knew
that
ted
future
lay
in
my
hands
as
it
lies
in
yours
audrey
cheeks
reddened
with
pleasure
it
does
it
does
she
clasped
her
little
hands
passionately
as
if
they
were
holding
ted
and
his
future
tight
i
know
it
all
i
want
is
to
inspire
him
to
keep
him
true
to
himself
have
i
done
it
you
know
what
his
work
was
like
before
he
loved
me
can
you
say
that
he
ever
painted
better
than
he
does
now
or
even
as
well
katherine
could
not
honestly
say
that
he
had
but
she
smiled
as
she
answered
no
but
for
the
last
six
months
he
has
done
nothing
from
anybody
but
yourself
you
make
a
very
charming
picture
audrey
but
you
can
hardly
want
people
to
say
that
your
husband
can
only
paint
one
type
my
husband
can
paint
as
many
types
as
he
pleases
katherine
still
looked
dubious
anything
more
yes
one
thing
you
say
you
want
to
keep
ted
true
to
himself
as
you
put
it
he
made
up
his
mind
this
morning
to
go
to
paris
to
study
hard
for
six
months
it
means
a
lot
of
for
you
both
to
be
separated
so
soon
but
it
will
be
the
making
of
him
you
wo
let
him
change
his
mind
you
wo
say
anything
to
keep
him
back
will
you
audrey
face
had
suddenly
grown
hard
and
she
looked
away
from
katherine
as
she
answered
you
not
very
consistent
i
must
say
you
ca
think
ted
such
an
utter
baby
if
you
trust
him
to
go
off
to
paris
all
by
himself
as
to
his
making
up
his
mind
this
morning
our
engagement
alters
all
that
after
all
how
can
it
affect
ted
career
if
he
goes
now
or
three
years
hence
it
makes
all
the
difference
i
ca
see
it
and
yet
and
yet
i
would
spoil
ted
chances
for
worlds
she
rose
and
walked
a
few
paces
to
and
fro
let
me
think
let
me
think
she
stood
still
an
image
of
abstract
justice
with
one
hand
folded
over
her
eyes
and
the
other
clenched
as
if
it
held
the
invisible
scales
of
destiny
weighing
her
present
overcharged
with
agreeable
sensations
against
her
lover
future
apparently
after
some
shifting
of
the
weights
she
had
made
the
two
balance
for
she
clapped
her
hands
suddenly
and
exclaimed
with
an
emphasis
on
every
other
word
katherine
an
inspiration
we
go
to
paris
for
our
honeymoon
and
ted
shall
stay
there
six
months
a
year
for
ever
if
he
likes
paris
is
the
place
i
adore
above
all
others
i
shall
simply
live
in
that
dear
louvre
she
added
in
more
tones
and
i
need
order
my
trousseau
till
i
get
there
that
save
no
end
of
bother
on
this
side
i
hate
the
way
we
do
things
here
for
weeks
before
your
to
have
to
think
of
nothing
but
clothes
clothes
clothes
could
anything
be
more
revolting
yes
said
katherine
to
think
of
them
before
a
funeral
audrey
looked
offended
death
like
religion
is
one
of
those
subjects
which
it
is
very
bad
taste
to
mention
under
some
circumstances
katherine
went
away
more
disheartened
than
ever
and
more
especially
weighed
down
by
the
consciousness
that
she
had
made
a
fool
of
herself
she
knew
audrey
to
be
vain
she
divined
that
she
was
selfish
but
at
least
she
had
believed
that
she
could
be
generous
by
letting
her
feel
that
she
held
ted
future
in
her
hands
she
had
roused
all
her
vague
cupidity
and
passion
for
power
and
henceforth
any
appeal
to
her
generosity
would
be
worse
than
useless
with
a
little
of
her
old
artistic
egoism
katherine
valued
her
brother
career
very
much
as
a
thing
of
her
own
making
and
the
idea
of
another
woman
meddling
with
it
and
spoiling
it
was
insupportable
it
was
as
if
some
reckless
colourist
had
taken
the
witch
of
atlas
and
daubed
her
all
over
with
frightful
scarlet
and
magenta
but
the
trouble
at
her
heart
of
hearts
was
the
certainty
that
audrey
that
creature
of
dubious
intellect
and
fitful
emotions
would
never
be
able
to
love
ted
as
his
wife
should
love
him
chapter
viii
all
true
revelations
soon
seem
as
old
as
the
hills
and
as
obvious
yesterday
they
were
not
they
have
struck
you
dumb
they
will
have
become
commonplaces
and
henceforth
you
will
be
incapable
of
seeing
anything
else
so
it
was
with
audrey
her
engagement
was
barely
a
week
old
before
she
felt
that
it
had
lasted
for
ever
not
that
she
was
tired
of
it
on
the
contrary
she
hoped
everything
from
eccentricity
she
was
sick
to
death
of
the
polished
conventional
type
the
man
who
if
he
came
into
her
life
at
all
must
be
introduced
in
the
recognised
way
while
ted
who
had
dropped
into
it
literally
through
a
skylight
roused
her
unflagging
interest
and
curiosity
she
was
always
longing
to
see
what
the
boy
would
say
and
do
next
poor
audrey
her
own
character
was
mainly
such
a
bundle
of
negations
that
you
described
her
best
by
saying
what
she
was
not
but
other
positive
qualities
acted
on
her
as
a
powerful
stimulant
and
it
was
one
for
which
she
perpetually
craved
she
had
found
it
in
hardy
in
him
it
was
the
almost
physical
charm
of
blind
will
and
she
yielded
to
it
unwillingly
she
had
found
it
in
ted
under
the
intoxicating
form
of
vivid
emotion
life
with
vincent
would
have
been
an
unbroken
bondage
life
with
ted
would
have
no
tyrannous
continuity
it
would
be
a
series
of
splendid
episodes
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
always
lived
this
sort
of
life
like
the
souls
in
ted
ingenious
masterpiece
audrey
had
suffered
a
metempsychosis
and
her
very
memory
was
changed
the
change
was
not
so
much
shown
in
the
character
of
her
dress
and
her
surroundings
audrey
was
not
the
first
woman
who
has
tried
to
be
original
by
following
the
fashion
these
things
were
only
the
outward
signs
of
an
inward
transformation
if
her
worship
of
the
beautiful
was
not
natural
it
was
not
altogether
affected
she
really
appreciated
the
things
she
saw
though
she
only
saw
them
through
as
much
of
ted
mind
as
was
transparent
to
her
at
the
moment
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
ask
herself
whether
she
would
have
chosen
to
stand
quite
so
often
on
the
embankment
watching
the
sun
go
down
behind
battersea
bridge
or
whether
she
would
have
sat
quite
so
many
hours
in
the
national
gallery
looking
at
those
madonnas
of
botticelli
that
ted
was
never
tired
of
talking
about
it
was
so
natural
that
he
should
be
always
with
her
when
she
did
these
things
that
it
was
impossible
to
disentangle
her
ideas
and
say
what
was
her
own
and
what
was
his
she
was
not
given
to
but
there
were
limits
to
audrey
capacity
for
receiving
impressions
between
her
and
the
world
where
katherine
always
lived
and
which
ted
visited
at
intervals
now
becoming
rarer
and
rarer
there
was
a
great
gulf
fixed
after
all
audrey
had
no
grasp
of
the
impersonal
she
could
only
care
for
any
object
as
it
gave
her
certain
emotions
raised
certain
associations
or
drew
attention
to
herself
she
was
at
home
in
the
dim
borderland
between
art
and
nature
the
region
of
vanity
and
vague
sensation
here
she
could
meet
ted
and
talk
to
him
about
ideals
for
the
hour
together
but
in
the
realm
of
pure
art
as
he
had
told
her
when
she
once
said
that
she
liked
all
his
pictures
because
they
were
his
personalities
count
for
nothing
you
must
have
an
eye
for
the
thing
itself
and
the
thing
itself
was
the
one
thing
that
audrey
could
not
see
in
that
world
she
was
a
pilgrim
and
a
stranger
it
was
peopled
with
shadowy
fantastic
rivals
who
left
her
with
no
field
and
no
favour
flesh
and
blood
were
powerless
to
contend
against
them
they
excited
no
jealousy
they
were
too
intangible
for
that
but
in
their
presence
she
had
a
sense
of
helpless
irritation
and
bewilderment
it
baffled
overpowered
and
humiliated
her
to
a
woman
thirsting
for
a
great
experience
it
was
hard
to
find
that
the
best
things
lay
always
just
beyond
her
reach
that
in
ted
life
after
all
of
it
that
she
had
absorbed
and
made
her
own
there
was
still
an
elusive
something
on
which
she
had
no
hold
not
that
she
allowed
this
reflection
to
trouble
her
happiness
long
as
katherine
had
said
ted
was
two
people
very
imperfectly
rolled
into
one
consciously
or
unconsciously
it
became
more
and
more
audrey
aim
to
separate
them
to
play
off
the
one
against
the
other
this
called
for
but
little
skill
on
her
part
ted
passion
at
its
had
fused
together
the
boy
soul
and
the
artist
but
at
any
temperature
short
of
that
its
natural
effect
was
disintegration
audrey
had
some
cause
to
congratulate
herself
on
the
result
it
might
or
might
not
have
been
flattering
to
be
called
a
clever
puss
or
an
imaginative
minx
ted
chose
his
epithets
at
random
whenever
she
pointed
out
some
novel
effect
of
colour
or
picturesque
grouping
but
it
was
now
july
and
ted
had
not
done
a
stroke
of
work
since
he
put
the
last
touches
to
her
portrait
in
april
it
was
now
july
and
from
across
the
atlantic
came
the
first
rumours
of
hardy
return
within
a
month
or
six
weeks
at
the
latest
he
would
be
in
england
in
london
the
news
set
audrey
thinking
and
think
as
she
would
the
question
perpetually
recurred
whether
would
it
be
better
to
announce
her
engagement
to
ted
or
still
keep
it
a
secret
still
drift
on
indefinitely
as
they
had
done
for
the
last
four
months
if
audrey
had
formed
any
idea
of
the
future
at
all
it
was
as
a
confused
mirage
of
possibilities
visions
of
express
trains
in
which
she
and
ted
were
whirled
on
for
ever
through
strange
landscapes
visions
of
parisian
life
as
she
pictured
it
a
series
of
exquisite
idyls
the
long
days
of
quivering
sunlight
under
blue
skies
the
brief
languid
nights
dying
into
dawn
coffee
and
rolls
brought
to
you
before
you
get
up
strawberries
eaten
with
claret
instead
of
cream
because
cream
makes
you
ill
in
hot
climates
the
paris
of
fiction
and
the
paris
of
commonplace
report
and
with
it
all
scene
after
scene
in
which
she
figured
as
doing
a
thousand
extravagant
and
interesting
things
always
dressed
in
appropriate
costumes
always
making
characteristic
little
speeches
to
ted
who
invariably
replied
with
some
delicious
absurdity
the
peculiarity
of
these
scenes
was
that
though
they
succeeded
each
other
through
endless
time
yet
neither
she
nor
ted
ever
appeared
a
day
older
in
them
as
audrey
imagination
borrowed
nothing
from
the
past
it
had
no
sense
of
the
demands
made
by
the
future
now
although
in
publicly
announcing
her
engagement
to
ted
she
would
give
a
fixity
to
this
floating
phantasmagoria
which
would
rob
it
of
half
its
charm
on
the
other
hand
she
felt
the
need
of
some
such
definite
and
stable
tie
to
secure
her
against
vincent
claim
the
solidity
of
which
she
now
realised
for
the
first
time
unable
to
come
to
any
conclusion
she
continued
to
think
the
news
from
america
had
set
old
miss
craven
thinking
too
she
had
at
first
rejoiced
at
audrey
intimacy
with
the
havilands
for
various
reasons
she
was
glad
to
see
her
settling
down
for
the
first
time
in
her
volatile
life
into
a
friendship
with
another
girl
to
hear
of
her
being
interested
in
to
find
a
uniform
gaiety
taking
the
place
of
the
restless
captious
moods
which
made
others
suffer
besides
herself
as
for
the
boy
he
was
a
nice
clever
boy
who
would
make
his
way
in
the
world
but
he
was
only
the
boy
three
months
ago
if
anybody
had
told
miss
craven
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
an
engagement
between
audrey
and
ted
haviland
she
would
have
laughed
them
to
scorn
but
when
it
gradually
dawned
on
her
that
katherine
hardly
ever
called
at
the
house
with
her
brother
that
he
and
audrey
went
everywhere
together
and
katherine
never
made
a
third
in
their
expeditions
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
really
ought
to
speak
a
word
in
season
her
only
difficulty
was
to
find
the
season
after
much
futile
watching
of
her
opportunity
she
resolved
to
trust
to
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
unfortunately
the
moment
of
the
inspiration
happened
to
be
that
in
which
audrey
came
in
dressed
for
a
row
up
the
river
and
chafing
with
anxiety
because
ted
was
ten
minutes
behind
time
this
at
once
suggested
the
subject
in
hand
but
miss
craven
began
cautiously
audrey
my
dear
do
you
think
you
enough
wraps
with
you
these
evenings
on
the
river
are
treacherous
audrey
gave
an
impatient
twitch
to
a
sort
of
elizabethan
ruff
she
wore
round
her
neck
how
tiresome
of
ted
to
be
late
when
i
particularly
told
him
to
be
early
is
miss
haviland
going
with
you
poor
girl
she
looks
as
if
a
blow
on
the
river
would
do
her
good
she
is
h
you
better
wait
and
have
some
tea
first
i
waited
quite
long
enough
already
we
going
to
drive
to
hammersmith
and
we
shall
get
tea
there
or
at
kew
i
do
want
to
interfere
with
your
amusements
but
does
it
strike
you
as
er
a
little
imprudent
to
go
about
so
much
with
as
you
call
him
no
of
course
not
he
not
going
to
throw
me
overboard
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
i
should
go
with
him
yes
to
you
my
dear
and
i
daresay
to
the
young
man
himself
but
if
you
are
seen
together
people
are
sure
to
talk
let
them
i
do
mind
in
the
least
i
rather
like
it
it
yes
you
must
own
it
flattering
people
here
would
take
the
trouble
to
talk
if
i
were
nobody
london
is
oxford
no
you
may
do
many
things
in
oxford
which
you
may
do
in
london
but
times
have
changed
i
ca
imagine
your
dear
mother
saying
she
would
to
be
talked
about
please
do
speak
about
mother
in
that
way
you
know
i
never
could
bear
it
oh
there
a
ring
at
the
front
door
that
ted
she
stood
on
tiptoe
bending
forward
and
held
her
ear
to
the
door
no
it
is
it
some
wretched
visitor
do
keep
me
cousin
bella
or
i
shall
be
caught
really
audrey
now
we
are
on
the
subject
i
must
just
tell
you
that
your
conduct
lately
has
given
me
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
my
conduct
what
you
mean
i
have
broken
any
of
the
seven
commandments
thank
goodness
they
gone
i
mean
that
if
you
do
take
care
you
be
entangling
yourself
with
young
haviland
as
you
did
as
i
did
with
vincent
i
suppose
that
so
like
you
you
always
thinking
things
always
putting
that
and
that
together
and
doing
it
quite
wrong
you
were
hopelessly
out
of
it
about
vincent
whether
wrong
or
right
about
haviland
i
simply
sha
condescend
to
tell
you
and
having
lashed
herself
into
a
state
of
indignation
audrey
went
on
warmly
i
not
a
child
of
ten
i
wo
have
my
actions
criticised
i
wo
have
my
motives
spied
into
i
wo
be
ruled
by
your
miserable
provincial
standard
what
i
do
is
nobody
business
but
my
own
very
well
very
well
go
your
own
way
and
take
the
consequences
if
it
not
my
business
do
blame
me
when
you
get
into
difficulties
audrey
turned
round
with
a
withering
glance
cousin
bella
you
are
really
stupid
she
said
with
a
movement
of
her
foot
that
was
half
rage
half
sheer
excitement
ah
there
ted
at
last
she
ran
joyously
away
miss
craven
sank
back
in
her
chair
exhausted
by
her
unusual
moral
effort
and
too
deeply
hurt
to
return
the
smile
which
audrey
flashed
back
at
her
by
way
of
apology
as
she
flew
the
bitter
little
dialogue
at
any
rate
had
the
good
effect
of
wakening
audrey
to
the
practical
aspects
of
her
problem
before
their
engagement
could
be
announced
it
was
clear
that
ted
ought
to
be
properly
introduced
to
her
friends
however
she
might
affect
to
brave
it
out
audrey
was
sensitive
to
the
least
breath
of
unfavourable
opinion
and
she
did
not
want
it
said
that
she
had
picked
up
her
husband
heavens
knows
how
when
and
where
if
they
had
been
talked
about
already
no
time
should
be
lost
before
people
realised
that
ted
was
a
genius
with
a
future
before
him
his
sister
a
rising
artist
also
and
so
on
audrey
was
busy
with
these
thoughts
as
she
was
being
rowed
up
the
river
from
hammersmith
at
kew
the
room
where
they
had
tea
was
full
of
people
she
knew
and
as
she
and
ted
passed
on
to
a
table
in
a
far
corner
she
felt
rather
than
saw
that
the
men
looked
after
them
and
the
women
exchanged
glances
the
same
thing
happened
at
richmond
where
they
dined
and
there
a
little
knot
of
people
gathered
about
the
river
bank
and
watched
their
departure
with
more
than
friendly
interest
if
she
had
any
lingering
doubts
before
audrey
was
ready
now
to
make
her
engagement
known
for
mere
prudence
sake
and
as
they
almost
drifted
down
in
the
quiet
july
evening
between
the
humid
of
the
sunset
and
the
dawn
of
the
moonlit
night
audrey
felt
a
wholly
new
and
delicate
sensation
it
was
as
if
she
were
penetrated
for
the
first
time
by
the
indefinable
tender
influences
of
air
and
moonlight
and
running
water
the
mood
was
vague
and
momentary
a
mere
fugitive
reflection
of
the
rapture
with
which
ted
rowing
lazily
now
with
the
current
drank
in
the
glory
of
life
and
felt
the
heart
of
all
nature
beating
with
his
yet
for
that
one
instant
transient
as
it
was
audrey
decision
was
being
shaped
for
her
by
a
motive
finer
than
all
prudence
stronger
than
all
sense
of
propriety
in
its
temporary
transfiguration
her
love
for
ted
was
such
that
she
would
have
been
ready
if
need
were
to
fix
siberia
for
their
honeymoon
and
for
their
as
they
parted
on
her
doorstep
at
chelsea
between
ten
and
eleven
she
whispered
ted
that
row
down
was
like
heaven
i
never
never
been
so
happy
in
all
my
life
if
she
did
not
fix
their
then
and
there
she
did
the
next
best
thing
she
fixed
the
day
for
a
dinner
to
be
given
in
ted
honour
not
a
tedious
large
affair
of
course
she
was
only
going
to
ask
a
few
people
who
would
appreciate
ted
and
be
useful
to
him
in
the
future
as
it
was
nearly
the
end
of
the
season
audrey
had
no
time
to
lose
and
the
first
thing
she
did
after
her
arrival
was
to
startle
miss
craven
by
the
sudden
question
cousin
bella
who
was
the
man
who
rushed
out
of
his
bath
into
the
street
shouting
i
never
heard
of
any
one
doing
so
said
cousin
bella
a
little
testily
and
if
he
did
it
was
most
improper
of
him
was
it
never
mind
he
had
an
idea
so
have
i
think
i
shall
run
out
on
to
the
embankment
and
shout
too
are
you
dying
to
know
i
going
to
give
a
grand
dinner
for
te
for
and
miss
haviland
and
i
not
going
to
ask
one
single
nonentity
there
first
of
all
we
must
have
knowles
of
course
then
perhaps
flaxman
reed
h
yes
we
have
asked
him
since
he
came
up
to
teresa
if
he
is
anybody
in
particular
you
ca
exactly
call
him
nobody
having
settled
the
question
of
flaxman
reed
audrey
sat
down
and
sent
off
several
invitations
on
the
spot
owing
to
some
refusals
the
gradually
shrank
in
size
and
importance
and
it
was
not
until
within
four
days
of
its
date
that
audrey
discovered
to
her
dismay
that
she
was
a
man
short
as
good
luck
would
have
it
she
met
knowles
that
afternoon
in
regent
street
and
confided
to
him
her
difficulty
and
her
firm
determination
not
to
fill
the
gap
with
any
nonentity
whatever
audrey
was
a
little
bit
afraid
of
percival
knowles
and
nothing
but
real
extremity
would
have
driven
her
to
this
desperate
course
if
you
could
suggest
any
one
i
know
who
is
a
nonentity
and
who
would
mind
such
ridiculously
short
notice
it
really
quite
an
informal
little
dinner
got
up
in
a
hurry
you
know
for
haviland
a
very
clever
young
artist
and
his
sister
knowles
smiled
faintly
he
had
heard
before
of
the
very
clever
young
artist
though
not
of
his
sister
he
was
all
sympathy
sorry
i
ca
think
of
any
one
you
know
a
nonentity
but
i
should
like
to
bring
a
friend
if
i
may
you
do
know
him
i
think
but
i
believe
he
very
much
wants
to
know
you
bring
him
by
all
means
if
he
wo
mind
such
a
casual
invitation
i
make
that
all
right
knowles
lifted
his
hat
and
was
about
to
hurry
away
you
have
told
me
your
friend
name
he
stopped
and
answered
with
a
sibilant
incoherence
struggling
as
he
was
with
his
amusement
but
at
that
moment
audrey
attention
was
diverted
by
the
sight
of
ted
coming
out
of
the
new
gallery
and
she
hardly
heard
what
was
being
said
to
her
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
john
she
called
back
making
a
random
shot
at
the
name
and
went
on
her
way
with
leisurely
haste
towards
the
new
gallery
chapter
ix
on
the
evening
of
her
dinner
audrey
had
some
difficulty
in
distributing
her
guests
after
all
eight
had
accepted
besides
the
havilands
with
knowles
and
his
friend
john
there
was
flaxman
reed
who
as
audrey
now
discovered
greatly
to
her
satisfaction
was
causing
some
excitement
in
the
religious
world
by
his
interesting
attitude
between
high
anglicanism
and
rome
there
were
dixon
barnett
the
great
asiatic
explorer
and
his
wife
and
miss
gladys
armstrong
the
daring
authoress
of
sour
grapes
and
through
fire
to
moloch
two
novels
dealing
with
the
problem
of
heredity
audrey
had
to
contrive
as
best
she
might
to
make
herself
the
centre
of
attraction
throughout
the
evening
and
at
the
same
time
do
justice
to
each
of
her
distinguished
guests
the
question
was
who
was
to
take
her
in
to
dinner
after
weighing
impartially
the
claims
of
her
three
more
or
less
intimate
acquaintances
audrey
decided
in
favour
of
the
unknown
she
felt
unusual
complacence
with
this
arrangement
her
fancies
were
beginning
to
cluster
round
the
idea
of
john
with
curiosity
it
was
to
be
herself
and
john
then
knowles
and
miss
armstrong
of
course
the
critic
was
so
cynical
and
hard
to
please
that
she
felt
a
little
triumphant
in
having
secured
some
one
whom
he
would
surely
be
delighted
to
meet
flaxman
reed
and
katherine
dixon
barnett
dixon
barnett
falling
to
katherine
share
for
ted
quite
naturally
there
remained
nobody
but
cousin
bella
poor
boy
he
be
terribly
bored
i
afraid
but
it
ca
be
helped
the
havilands
were
the
first
to
arrive
how
superb
you
look
was
audrey
exclamation
as
she
kissed
her
friend
on
both
cheeks
and
stepped
back
to
take
a
good
look
at
her
katherine
appearance
justified
the
epithet
her
gown
the
work
of
her
own
hands
was
of
some
transparent
black
stuff
swathed
about
her
breasts
setting
off
the
pallor
of
her
skin
her
slight
figure
supplied
any
grace
that
was
wanting
in
the
draperies
that
black
and
white
was
a
splendid
foil
for
audrey
burnished
hair
and
her
dress
an
ingenious
medley
of
and
ivory
silk
one
moment
dear
just
let
me
pin
that
chiffon
up
on
your
shoulder
to
make
your
sleeves
look
wider
there
she
hovered
round
katherine
spying
out
the
weak
points
in
her
dress
and
disguising
them
with
quick
skillful
fingers
a
woman
never
looks
more
charming
than
when
doing
these
little
services
for
another
so
ted
thought
as
he
watched
audrey
laying
her
white
arms
about
his
sister
and
putting
her
head
on
one
side
to
survey
the
effect
critically
to
the
boy
with
his
senses
sharpened
to
an
almost
feverish
subtilty
by
the
incessant
stimulus
of
his
imagination
audrey
was
the
epitome
of
everything
most
completely
and
joyously
alive
roses
sunlight
flame
with
the
shifting
waving
lines
of
all
things
most
fluent
and
elusive
were
in
her
face
her
hair
the
movements
of
her
limbs
her
body
was
like
a
soul
to
its
clothes
it
animated
inspired
the
mass
of
silk
and
lace
he
could
not
think
of
her
as
she
was
the
creature
of
the
day
and
the
hour
modern
from
the
surface
to
the
core
yet
never
had
she
looked
more
modern
than
at
this
moment
never
had
that
vivid
quality
that
touch
of
artificial
distinction
appeared
more
stereotyped
in
its
very
perfection
and
finish
but
ted
in
the
first
religious
fervour
of
his
passion
had
painted
her
as
the
saint
of
the
beatific
vision
and
in
the
same
way
to
ted
ever
since
that
evening
on
the
river
she
recalled
none
but
images
she
was
linked
by
flowery
chains
of
association
to
an
idyllic
past
a
past
of
four
days
ago
her
very
caprices
suggested
the
shy
approaches
and
withdrawals
of
some
divinity
of
nature
it
was
by
these
harmless
fictions
each
new
one
rising
on
the
ruins
of
the
old
that
ted
managed
to
keep
his
ideal
of
audrey
intact
there
was
a
slight
stir
in
the
passage
outside
the
door
audrey
still
busy
about
katherine
dress
seemed
not
to
hear
it
my
dear
audrey
protested
miss
craven
from
her
corner
there
that
do
said
katherine
laughing
you
stuck
quite
enough
pins
into
me
for
one
night
stand
still
and
do
wiggle
cried
audrey
as
the
door
opened
wide
for
a
second
she
was
conscious
of
being
watched
by
eyes
that
were
not
ted
or
anything
like
them
at
the
same
time
the
footman
announced
in
a
firm
clear
voice
knowles
and
langley
wyndham
she
had
heard
this
time
the
look
she
had
seen
from
the
doorway
was
the
same
look
that
had
followed
her
in
the
dean
at
oxford
all
the
emotions
of
that
evening
thronged
back
into
her
mind
the
vague
fascination
the
tense
excitement
the
mortification
that
resulted
from
the
wound
to
her
and
pride
so
this
was
john
a
year
ago
he
had
refused
an
introduction
to
her
and
now
he
wanted
to
know
her
his
friend
had
said
so
he
was
seeking
the
acquaintance
of
his
own
accord
without
encouragement
how
odd
it
all
was
well
whether
his
former
discourtesy
had
been
intentional
or
not
he
knew
how
to
apologise
for
it
gracefully
she
had
no
time
to
think
more
about
the
matter
for
her
remaining
guests
came
in
all
together
and
in
another
five
minutes
audrey
was
suffering
from
that
kind
of
nightmare
in
which
some
grave
issue
you
do
know
precisely
what
hangs
on
the
adjustment
of
trifles
absurdly
disproportionate
to
the
event
and
which
disarrange
themselves
perversely
at
the
dramatic
moment
everything
seemed
to
go
wrong
she
had
relied
on
knowles
and
miss
gladys
armstrong
for
a
brilliant
display
of
intellectual
fireworks
but
beyond
the
first
casual
remarks
absolutely
required
of
them
they
had
not
a
word
to
say
to
each
other
miss
armstrong
managed
cleverly
enough
to
strike
a
little
spark
of
epigram
from
the
flinty
dialogue
it
flickered
and
went
out
knowles
smiled
politely
at
the
abortive
attempt
but
at
her
first
serious
remark
he
shook
his
head
as
much
as
to
say
my
dear
lady
this
is
a
conundrum
i
give
it
up
and
finally
turned
to
katherine
on
his
left
in
fact
he
monopolised
her
during
the
rest
of
dinner
much
to
the
annoyance
of
dixon
barnett
who
spent
himself
in
futile
efforts
to
win
back
her
interest
his
behaviour
in
its
turn
rousing
the
uneasy
attention
of
dixon
barnett
she
again
was
so
preoccupied
in
watching
the
movements
of
her
lord
that
she
almost
forgot
the
existence
of
flaxman
reed
who
sat
silent
and
depressed
under
her
shadow
wyndham
gave
audrey
credit
for
great
perspicacity
in
pairing
these
two
off
together
poor
fellow
he
said
to
himself
to
preserve
him
from
the
temptations
of
the
world
and
the
flesh
she
considerately
sent
him
in
with
the
devil
for
his
own
part
he
devoted
himself
to
audrey
and
his
dinner
from
time
to
time
he
glanced
across
the
table
and
whenever
he
did
so
the
corners
of
knowles
mouth
twitched
nervously
and
he
began
to
stroke
his
upper
lip
a
provoking
habit
of
his
seeing
that
he
had
no
moustache
to
account
for
it
evidently
there
was
some
secret
understanding
between
the
two
and
wyndham
was
gravely
and
maliciously
amused
katherine
was
enjoying
herself
too
but
without
malice
she
had
so
few
acquaintances
and
lived
so
much
in
the
studio
that
it
was
all
fresh
life
to
her
she
was
pleased
with
that
unconscious
irony
of
which
had
thrown
knowles
and
miss
armstrong
together
pleased
with
the
between
knowles
and
wyndham
and
with
the
behaviour
of
the
married
couple
it
was
always
a
delight
to
her
to
watch
strange
faces
dixon
barnett
was
a
big
woman
with
a
long
head
and
she
looked
something
like
a
horse
with
its
ears
laid
back
her
hair
being
arranged
to
carry
out
that
idea
the
great
asiatic
explorer
whose
round
face
wore
an
expression
of
permanent
surprise
suggested
a
man
who
has
met
with
some
sudden
shock
from
which
he
has
never
recovered
katherine
felt
sorry
for
the
asiatic
explorer
she
felt
sorry
for
miss
gladys
armstrong
too
a
little
pale
woman
with
a
large
gaze
that
seemed
to
take
you
in
without
looking
at
you
her
face
still
young
and
childlike
was
scored
with
the
marks
of
hard
work
and
eager
ambition
and
there
was
bitterness
in
the
downward
droop
of
her
delicate
mouth
yet
the
authoress
of
sour
grapes
was
undeniably
a
successful
woman
and
wyndham
too
the
successful
man
wyndham
face
attracted
katherine
in
spite
of
herself
it
was
full
of
such
curious
inconsistencies
altogether
it
was
refined
impressive
almost
noble
yet
each
of
the
features
contradicted
itself
the
others
and
the
whole
the
general
outline
was
finely
cut
but
it
looked
a
little
worn
at
the
edges
the
shaven
lips
were
sensitive
but
they
had
hard
curves
at
the
corners
they
were
firm
without
expressing
in
the
same
way
the
nose
was
fine
at
the
bridge
and
coarse
towards
the
nostrils
the
iris
of
the
eyes
was
beautiful
with
its
clear
brown
streaks
on
an
orb
of
greenish
grey
yet
his
eyes
were
the
most
disagreeable
feature
in
wyndham
face
as
for
knowles
he
interested
her
with
his
genial
cynicism
but
it
was
a
relief
to
turn
from
these
restless
types
to
flaxman
reed
he
had
the
face
of
the
ideal
ascetic
sweet
in
its
austerity
militant
in
its
renunciation
what
in
heaven
name
was
he
doing
at
audrey
craven
katherine
was
not
too
much
absorbed
in
these
speculations
to
see
that
ted
was
behaving
very
prettily
to
old
miss
craven
and
making
himself
useful
by
filling
up
awkward
pauses
with
irrelevant
remarks
the
boy
looked
perfectly
happy
audrey
mere
presence
seemed
to
satisfy
him
though
she
had
not
spoken
a
dozen
words
to
him
that
evening
and
was
separated
from
him
by
the
length
of
the
table
at
last
she
rose
and
as
he
held
the
door
open
for
her
to
go
out
she
turned
to
him
with
arched
eyebrows
and
a
smile
that
was
meant
to
say
you
been
shamefully
neglected
i
know
but
i
had
to
attend
to
these
tiresome
people
katherine
saw
wyndham
making
a
mental
note
of
the
look
and
the
smile
she
had
taken
an
instinctive
dislike
to
that
man
upstairs
in
the
the
five
women
settled
down
in
a
confidential
group
and
with
one
accord
fell
to
discussing
wyndham
miss
craven
began
it
by
mildly
wondering
whether
he
looked
so
disagreeable
on
purpose
or
because
he
could
help
it
on
the
whole
she
inclined
to
the
more
charitable
view
what
do
you
say
kathy
asked
audrey
without
looking
up
i
agree
with
miss
craven
in
thinking
nature
responsible
for
wyndham
manners
dixon
barnett
disapproved
of
katherine
but
she
joined
in
here
with
a
guttural
assent
poor
man
said
miss
gladys
armstrong
he
certainly
has
improved
since
that
affair
with
miss
fraser
audrey
looked
up
suddenly
what
affair
do
you
know
they
were
engaged
a
long
time
fixed
and
everything
when
she
broke
it
off
suddenly
without
a
word
of
warning
why
why
indeed
she
left
her
reasons
to
the
imagination
when
did
it
happen
just
about
this
time
last
year
i
ca
think
what
made
her
do
it
unless
she
had
a
turn
for
psychical
research
raking
in
the
ashes
of
his
past
and
that
sort
of
thing
was
he
very
much
cut
up
about
it
he
did
whine
but
he
got
an
ugly
wound
somewhere
about
him
curious
man
langley
wyndham
i
have
got
to
the
bottom
of
him
yet
and
i
flatter
myself
i
know
most
men
my
diagnosis
is
generally
pretty
correct
he
a
very
interesting
type
very
said
audrey
below
her
breath
the
novelist
knitted
her
brows
and
fell
into
a
reverie
her
interest
in
langley
wyndham
was
not
a
purely
professional
one
audrey
reflected
too
just
about
this
time
last
year
that
might
account
for
things
she
would
have
liked
to
ask
more
but
further
discussion
of
his
history
was
cut
short
by
the
entrance
of
wyndham
himself
followed
by
the
rest
flaxman
reed
was
the
first
to
take
the
empty
seat
by
audrey
side
he
remembered
the
talk
he
had
with
her
at
oxford
that
talk
which
had
provoked
wyndham
sarcastic
comments
himself
a
strange
compound
of
intellectual
subtilty
and
broad
simplicity
of
character
he
had
taken
audrey
utterances
in
good
faith
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
spiritual
things
in
one
of
those
moments
of
which
he
knew
well
come
suddenly
to
those
especially
to
women
whose
inner
life
is
troubled
but
this
was
not
the
atmosphere
to
revive
such
themes
in
he
had
no
part
in
audrey
and
in
wyndham
world
the
world
which
cared
nothing
for
the
principles
he
represented
those
two
great
ideals
which
he
served
in
his
spirit
and
his
body
the
unity
of
the
church
and
the
celibacy
of
the
priesthood
but
audrey
interested
him
he
had
first
met
last
seen
her
during
a
spiritual
and
intellectual
crisis
he
had
stood
alone
then
severed
from
those
dearest
to
him
by
troubled
seas
of
controversy
and
a
word
a
look
had
passed
which
showed
that
she
this
woman
sympathised
with
him
it
was
enough
there
still
clung
to
her
the
grave
and
tender
associations
of
that
time
the
woman
was
unable
to
give
him
her
attention
audrey
was
disturbed
and
preoccupied
ted
was
lounging
at
the
back
of
her
chair
hanging
on
her
words
wyndham
and
miss
armstrong
were
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
her
and
she
felt
herself
straining
every
nerve
to
catch
what
they
were
saying
yes
said
miss
armstrong
in
the
tone
of
a
proud
parent
fire
to
moloch
was
my
first
in
that
book
i
threw
down
the
gauntlet
to
society
it
shrugged
its
shoulders
and
took
no
notice
my
second
grapes
was
a
in
its
face
it
shrieked
that
time
but
it
read
grapes
which
at
once
increased
the
demand
for
fire
to
moloch
i
congratulate
you
miss
armstrong
ignored
the
impertinent
parenthesis
the
critics
abused
me
but
i
expected
that
they
are
men
and
it
was
the
men
i
exposed
knowles
who
was
standing
near
smiled
and
blushed
when
he
caught
himself
smiling
wyndham
laughed
frankly
at
his
confusion
and
audrey
grew
hot
and
cold
by
turns
what
was
the
dreadful
joke
those
two
had
about
miss
armstrong
she
leaned
back
and
looked
up
at
ted
sweetly
ted
i
should
like
to
introduce
you
to
knowles
he
tell
you
all
about
that
illustrated
thing
you
wanted
to
get
on
to
i
afraid
said
knowles
that
not
in
my
line
i
do
know
anything
about
any
illustrated
things
well
never
mind
i
want
you
to
know
something
about
haviland
anyhow
this
was
just
what
knowles
wanted
himself
he
was
deeply
interested
in
the
situation
as
far
as
he
understood
it
and
he
looked
forward
to
its
development
this
little
diversion
created
miss
armstrong
continued
with
imperturbable
calm
but
audrey
listening
with
one
ear
to
flaxman
reed
only
heard
the
livelier
parts
of
the
dialogue
life
is
all
starched
linen
and
said
miss
armstrong
sententiously
did
i
ever
say
it
was
returned
wyndham
virtually
you
do
you
turn
your
back
on
average
humanity
pardon
me
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
use
discrimination
nature
has
no
discrimination
exactly
and
nature
has
no
consideration
for
our
feelings
and
very
little
maidenly
reserve
therefore
we
invented
art
audrey
leaned
forward
eagerly
she
felt
an
unusual
exaltation
at
last
she
was
in
the
centre
of
intellectual
life
carried
on
by
the
whirl
of
ideas
she
answered
her
companion
at
random
yes
flaxman
reed
was
saying
my
work
disheartening
half
my
parish
are
animals
brutalised
by
starvation
degraded
out
of
all
likeness
to
men
and
women
how
dreadful
what
hard
work
it
must
be
hard
enough
to
find
decent
food
and
clothing
for
their
bodies
but
to
have
to
a
soul
under
those
ribs
of
death
he
paused
his
voice
seemed
suddenly
to
run
dry
yes
said
audrey
in
her
buoyant
staccato
i
ca
think
how
you
manage
it
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
wyndham
had
turned
from
miss
armstrong
knowles
and
ted
had
long
ago
joined
miss
haviland
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
dixon
barnett
still
irresistibly
attracted
by
katherine
hovered
round
and
round
the
little
group
with
the
fatal
desire
of
the
moth
for
the
star
audrey
stood
up
miss
armstrong
was
holding
out
her
hand
and
pleading
a
further
engagement
the
little
woman
looked
sour
and
ruffled
wyndham
manner
had
acted
on
her
like
vinegar
on
milk
she
was
followed
by
flaxman
reed
wyndham
dropped
into
the
seat
he
left
dixon
said
barnett
in
a
low
voice
which
the
explorer
knew
and
obeyed
they
were
going
on
to
a
large
at
home
audrey
turned
to
wyndham
with
a
smile
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
follow
them
mr
wyndham
no
i
not
a
person
of
many
engagements
i
thankful
to
say
barnett
has
much
the
cut
of
a
great
explorer
has
he
no
but
those
wiry
little
men
can
go
through
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
is
barnett
a
friend
of
yours
no
not
especially
why
mere
curiosity
that
mouth
of
hers
ought
to
have
a
bit
in
it
enough
to
send
any
man
exploring
in
central
asia
i
can
understand
barnett
mania
for
regions
untrodden
by
the
foot
of
man
or
woman
audrey
laughed
a
little
nervously
i
made
a
mistake
in
introducing
him
to
miss
haviland
it
was
a
little
cruel
of
you
but
not
half
so
unkind
as
asking
miss
armstrong
to
meet
knowles
that
was
a
refinement
of
cruelty
why
what
have
i
done
tell
me
did
you
know
that
knowles
went
for
miss
armstrong
in
last
criticised
witticised
slaughtered
and
utterly
made
game
of
her
no
i
no
idea
i
thought
they
be
delighted
to
meet
each
other
and
i
know
so
few
really
clever
people
you
know
this
rather
plaintively
he
does
cut
up
people
so
dreadfully
too
he
cut
her
up
into
very
small
pieces
knowles
does
these
things
artistically
he
so
urbane
in
his
brutality
that
what
makes
it
so
crushing
are
you
an
admirer
of
miss
armstrong
he
looked
her
full
in
the
face
and
audrey
blushed
she
had
read
miss
armstrong
works
and
liked
them
because
it
was
the
fashion
but
not
for
worlds
would
she
have
admitted
the
fact
now
i
do
think
i
am
i
not
read
her
books
you
like
them
i
i
hardly
know
she
written
so
many
and
i
ca
understand
them
at
least
not
all
of
them
wyndham
smiled
she
had
read
all
of
them
then
i
glad
to
hear
it
i
ca
understand
them
myself
but
i
detest
them
all
the
same
i
thought
so
i
saw
you
were
having
an
argument
with
her
oh
as
for
that
i
agreed
with
her
with
her
theory
that
is
not
with
her
practice
that
execrable
but
whatever
she
says
i
always
want
to
support
the
other
side
he
changed
the
subject
much
to
audrey
relief
i
think
you
knew
flaxman
reed
at
oxford
yes
slightly
he
an
old
friend
of
my
uncle
there
something
infinitely
pathetic
about
him
i
an
immense
respect
for
him
probably
because
i
do
understand
him
i
was
surprised
to
meet
him
here
really
you
are
very
uncomplimentary
to
me
am
i
reed
has
renounced
all
the
pleasant
things
of
life
hence
my
astonishment
at
seeing
him
here
do
you
find
him
easy
to
get
on
with
perfectly
she
became
absorbed
in
picking
the
broken
feathers
out
of
her
fan
she
took
no
interest
in
flaxman
reed
what
she
wanted
was
to
be
roused
stimulated
by
contact
with
a
great
intellect
and
the
precious
opportunity
was
slipping
minute
by
minute
from
her
grasp
wyndham
was
wasting
it
in
deliberate
trivialities
she
longed
to
draw
him
into
some
subject
large
and
deep
where
their
sympathies
could
touch
their
thoughts
expand
and
intermingle
she
continued
tentatively
with
a
suggestion
of
suffering
in
her
voice
i
think
i
have
any
right
to
discuss
reed
you
know
i
have
no
firm
faith
no
settled
opinions
it
was
an
opening
into
the
larger
air
a
very
little
one
she
had
no
knowledge
or
skill
to
make
it
bigger
but
she
was
determined
to
show
herself
a
woman
abreast
of
her
time
wyndham
leaned
back
and
looked
at
her
through
eyelids
you
are
no
longer
convinced
of
the
splendid
logic
of
the
roman
faith
she
started
his
words
recalled
vividly
that
evening
at
oxford
though
she
would
not
have
recognised
them
as
hers
but
for
the
quotation
marks
indicated
by
wyndham
tone
no
that
was
a
year
ago
what
did
you
know
about
me
then
nothing
i
divined
much
you
are
right
how
well
you
remember
she
leaned
forward
her
face
was
animated
eager
in
its
greed
of
sympathy
understanding
acknowledgment
clear
and
insistent
with
a
note
as
of
delicate
irony
the
little
porcelain
clock
in
the
corner
sounded
eleven
knowles
and
others
were
making
a
move
wyndham
rose
i
remember
most
things
worth
remembering
five
minutes
afterwards
audrey
wrapt
in
thought
was
still
standing
where
wyndham
had
left
her
miss
craven
and
katherine
had
gone
upstairs
and
she
was
alone
with
ted
suddenly
she
clenched
her
hands
together
at
the
full
length
of
her
white
arms
and
turned
to
him
in
an
agony
of
tenderness
clinging
to
him
like
an
overwrought
child
and
lavishing
more
sweetness
on
him
than
she
had
done
since
the
day
of
their
engagement
ted
was
touched
with
the
unusual
pathos
of
her
manner
he
put
it
down
to
sorrow
at
their
separation
during
the
whole
of
a
long
evening
chapter
x
it
was
the
third
week
in
august
summer
was
dying
as
a
london
summer
dies
in
days
of
feverish
sunlight
and
breathless
languor
everywhere
there
was
the
same
torpor
the
same
wornout
desiccated
life
in
death
it
was
in
the
streets
with
their
sultry
pallor
in
the
parks
and
squares
where
the
dust
lay
like
a
grey
blight
on
every
green
thing
everywhere
the
glare
accentuated
this
toneless
melancholy
it
was
the
symbol
of
the
decadence
following
the
brilliant
efflorescence
of
the
season
the
exhaustion
after
that
supreme
effort
of
society
to
amuse
itself
this
lassitude
is
felt
most
by
those
who
have
shared
least
in
the
amusement
the
workers
who
must
stay
behind
in
the
great
workshop
because
they
are
too
busy
or
too
poor
to
leave
it
there
was
one
worker
however
who
felt
nothing
of
this
depression
langley
wyndham
had
reasons
for
congratulating
himself
that
everybody
was
out
of
town
and
that
he
was
left
to
himself
in
his
rooms
in
dover
street
for
one
thing
it
gave
him
opportunity
for
cultivating
miss
craven
acquaintance
for
another
he
had
now
a
luxurious
leisure
in
which
to
polish
up
the
proofs
of
his
last
novel
and
to
arrange
his
ideas
for
its
successor
compared
with
this
great
work
all
former
efforts
would
seem
to
the
taste
they
had
created
as
so
much
literary
trifling
hitherto
he
had
been
merely
trying
his
instrument
running
his
fingers
over
the
keys
in
his
easy
professional
way
but
these
preliminary
flourishes
gave
no
idea
of
the
constructive
harmonies
to
follow
and
now
on
a
dull
evening
some
three
weeks
after
he
was
alone
in
his
study
smoking
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
in
one
of
those
dreamy
moods
which
with
him
meant
fiction
in
the
making
the
curling
round
his
head
the
pythian
fumes
of
his
inspiration
the
study
was
curiously
suggestive
of
its
owner
inconsistencies
with
its
silk
cushions
oriental
rugs
and
velvet
draperies
its
lining
of
books
and
heaped
with
manuscripts
and
proofs
it
witnessed
to
his
impartial
love
of
luxury
and
hard
work
it
told
other
secrets
too
the
on
the
table
beside
him
was
embroidered
by
a
woman
hand
the
initials
worked
with
gold
thread
in
a
raised
monogram
two
or
three
photographs
of
pretty
women
were
stuck
by
their
corners
behind
the
big
over
the
fireplace
together
with
invitation
cards
frivolous
little
notes
and
ball
programmes
on
one
end
of
the
there
was
a
photograph
of
knowles
on
the
other
the
one
nearest
wyndham
chair
an
empty
frame
of
solid
silver
the
photograph
and
the
frame
represented
the
friendship
and
the
love
of
his
life
he
had
left
his
proofs
untouched
on
the
and
had
settled
himself
comfortably
to
his
pipe
with
the
voluptuous
satisfaction
of
a
man
who
has
put
off
a
disagreeable
duty
he
felt
that
delicious
turmoil
of
ideas
which
with
him
accompanied
the
building
up
of
a
story
round
its
central
character
not
that
he
yet
understood
that
character
wyndham
had
his
intuitions
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
trust
them
as
such
it
was
his
habit
to
verify
them
by
a
subsequent
logic
his
literary
conscience
allowed
nothing
to
take
the
place
of
the
experimental
method
the
careful
observation
and
arranging
of
minute
facts
intimate
analytical
study
from
the
life
no
action
was
too
small
no
emotion
too
insignificant
for
his
uncompromising
realism
he
had
applied
the
same
method
to
his
own
experience
whatever
came
in
his
way
the
tragedy
or
comedy
of
his
daily
life
his
moods
of
passion
and
apathy
the
aspirations
of
his
better
moments
all
underwent
the
same
disintegrating
process
he
had
the
power
of
standing
aloof
from
himself
of
arresting
the
flight
of
his
own
sensations
and
criticising
his
own
actions
as
a
disinterested
spectator
thus
he
made
no
experiment
on
others
that
he
had
not
first
tried
on
his
own
person
if
any
man
ever
understood
himself
that
man
was
langley
wyndham
he
was
by
no
means
vain
of
this
distinction
on
the
contrary
he
would
have
said
that
as
a
man
inner
consciousness
is
the
only
thing
he
has
any
direct
knowledge
of
he
must
be
a
fool
if
he
can
live
with
himself
the
closest
of
all
human
relations
for
years
without
understanding
his
own
character
what
he
really
prided
himself
on
was
his
knowledge
of
other
people
especially
of
women
unfortunately
for
the
first
few
years
of
his
literary
life
he
knew
no
women
intimately
he
had
many
acquaintances
among
them
a
few
enemies
but
no
friends
and
the
little
he
knew
of
individuals
had
not
tended
to
raise
his
opinion
of
women
in
general
consequently
he
drew
them
all
as
he
saw
them
from
the
outside
the
best
sort
with
a
certain
delicacy
and
clearness
of
outline
the
result
of
unerring
eyesight
and
the
gift
of
style
the
worst
sort
with
an
incisive
almost
brutal
touch
that
suggested
the
black
lines
bitten
out
by
some
powerful
acid
his
work
took
because
of
its
coarser
qualities
the
accentuated
bitterness
the
startling
irony
the
vigorous
characteristic
phrase
those
black
strokes
were
not
introduced
to
throw
up
the
grey
wash
or
pencilled
shading
wyndham
cynicism
was
no
mere
literary
affectation
it
was
engrained
in
his
very
nature
he
had
gone
through
many
phases
of
disillusionment
including
disgust
at
his
own
success
before
that
brief
crisis
of
feeling
which
ended
in
his
engagement
to
miss
fraser
then
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
a
woman
nature
had
been
given
to
him
to
know
it
was
a
glorious
opportunity
for
the
born
analyst
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
let
an
opportunity
go
he
loved
alison
fraser
and
he
found
that
love
made
understanding
impossible
he
never
wanted
to
understand
her
the
relentless
passion
for
analysis
was
absorbed
in
a
comprehensive
enthusiasm
which
embraced
the
whole
of
alison
and
took
no
count
of
the
parts
to
have
pulled
her
to
pieces
even
with
a
view
to
reconstruction
would
have
been
a
profanation
of
her
and
of
his
love
for
a
whole
year
the
student
of
the
earthly
and
the
visible
lived
on
the
substance
of
things
unseen
on
faith
in
the
goodness
of
alison
fraser
by
a
peculiar
irony
it
was
her
very
goodness
for
she
was
a
good
woman
which
made
her
give
up
wyndham
as
miss
gladys
armstrong
had
guessed
or
as
she
would
have
put
it
diagnosed
a
detail
of
wyndham
past
life
had
come
to
miss
fraser
knowledge
as
these
details
always
come
through
a
friend
it
was
one
which
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
reconcile
her
marriage
with
wyndham
to
her
conscience
and
because
she
loved
him
because
the
thought
of
him
so
hard
to
other
women
so
tender
to
herself
fascinated
her
reason
and
paralysed
her
will
flattering
the
egoism
inherent
even
in
the
very
good
because
she
was
weak
and
he
was
irresistibly
strong
she
cut
herself
from
him
deliberately
and
with
one
stroke
she
had
just
sufficient
strength
for
the
sudden
breaking
off
of
their
engagement
none
for
explanation
and
none
alas
to
save
her
from
regretting
her
act
of
supererogatory
virtue
wyndham
gave
no
sign
of
suffering
he
simply
sank
back
into
himself
and
became
the
man
he
had
been
before
plus
his
experience
of
feeling
and
minus
the
ingenuousness
of
his
he
took
instead
to
trying
to
persuade
himself
that
because
he
could
not
have
alison
alison
was
not
worth
having
after
that
it
was
but
a
step
to
palming
off
on
his
reason
the
monstrous
syllogism
that
because
alison
was
unworthy
and
alison
was
a
woman
therefore
all
women
were
unworthy
except
for
purely
literary
purposes
he
had
done
with
the
sex
he
became
if
anything
more
intently
more
remorselessly
analytical
more
absolutely
the
student
of
human
nature
he
lived
now
in
and
for
his
work
he
struck
out
into
new
paths
he
was
tired
of
his
neutral
washes
and
striking
effects
in
black
and
white
he
had
begun
to
dream
of
glorious
subtilties
of
design
and
colour
novels
were
lying
in
his
head
ten
deep
he
had
whole
full
of
germs
and
embryos
all
neatly
arranged
in
their
separate
in
some
he
had
jotted
down
a
name
and
a
date
or
a
word
which
stood
for
a
whole
train
of
ideas
in
others
he
had
recorded
some
illustration
as
it
occurred
to
him
or
a
single
sentence
stood
flanked
by
a
dozen
variants
wyndham
being
a
careful
worker
and
sensitive
to
niceties
of
language
he
was
supremely
happy
he
saw
his
way
to
a
lovely
little
bit
of
psychological
realism
all
that
had
been
hitherto
wanting
to
this
particular
development
of
his
art
had
been
the
woman
in
audrey
craven
he
had
found
the
indispensable
thing
intimacy
without
love
or
even
as
he
understood
the
word
friendship
she
was
the
type
he
had
long
desired
the
feminine
creature
artless
in
perpetual
artifice
for
ever
revealing
herself
in
a
succession
of
disguises
he
was
beginning
to
adjust
his
latest
impressions
to
his
earlier
idea
of
her
he
recalled
the
evening
when
he
had
first
seen
her
the
hot
crowded
the
heavy
atmosphere
the
dull
faces
coming
and
going
and
the
figure
of
audrey
flashing
through
it
all
she
had
irritated
him
then
for
he
had
not
yet
classified
her
he
had
tried
not
to
think
of
her
she
dogged
his
thoughts
with
most
unmaidenly
insistence
her
image
lay
in
wait
for
him
at
every
of
association
it
was
something
vivid
yet
elusive
protean
yet
persistent
he
recalled
that
other
evening
of
her
their
first
recognised
meeting
her
whole
person
which
at
first
sight
had
impressed
him
with
its
emphatic
individuality
now
struck
him
as
characterless
and
conventional
and
yet
what
was
she
like
she
was
like
a
chameleon
no
she
was
he
recollected
that
the
change
of
colour
was
a
vital
process
in
that
animal
she
was
like
an
opal
all
sparkle
when
you
move
it
and
at
rest
dull
most
undeniably
dull
no
was
it
exactly
she
was
a
for
other
people
personalities
he
hated
the
horrid
word
and
apologised
to
himself
for
using
it
formless
and
colourless
reflecting
form
and
colour
after
a
moment
satisfaction
with
this
last
fancy
he
became
aware
that
he
was
being
made
the
fool
of
metaphor
that
was
not
his
way
to
find
out
what
lay
at
the
bottom
of
this
shifting
personality
what
elemental
thoughts
and
feelings
if
any
the
real
audrey
was
composed
of
to
see
for
himself
the
play
of
circumstances
on
her
plastic
nature
and
know
what
reaction
it
was
capable
of
in
a
word
to
experimentalise
in
cold
blood
on
the
living
nerve
and
brain
tissue
was
his
plan
of
work
for
the
year
making
a
mental
note
of
several
of
the
above
phrases
for
future
use
wyndham
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
and
went
to
bed
where
he
dreamed
that
the
devil
in
evening
dress
was
presenting
him
with
audrey
soul
done
up
in
a
brown
wrapper
marked
only
for
dissection
chapter
xi
it
was
in
no
direct
accordance
with
his
literary
plans
though
it
may
have
been
preordained
in
some
divine
scheme
of
chances
that
wyndham
found
himself
next
sunday
attending
evensong
at
teresa
lambeth
it
so
happened
that
audrey
and
the
havilands
had
chosen
that
very
evening
to
go
and
hear
or
as
ted
expressed
it
see
flaxman
reed
he
wanted
flaxman
reed
head
for
a
study
ted
seldom
condescended
to
enter
any
church
of
later
date
than
the
fifteenth
century
and
architecturally
speaking
he
feared
the
worst
from
teresa
indeed
smoke
fog
and
modern
gothic
genius
have
made
the
outside
of
that
building
one
with
the
grimy
street
it
stands
in
and
ted
was
not
prepared
for
the
golden
beauty
of
the
interior
his
judgment
halted
as
if
some
magic
effect
of
colour
had
blinded
it
to
stunted
form
and
pitiful
perspective
but
the
glory
of
teresa
is
its
music
the
three
were
shown
into
seats
in
the
chancel
as
the
choir
were
singing
the
music
was
the
one
art
to
which
audrey
nature
responded
spontaneously
after
its
kind
she
knelt
down
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
for
a
prayer
space
while
the
voices
of
the
choir
and
organ
shook
her
on
every
side
with
a
palpable
vibration
she
was
conscious
then
of
a
deep
sense
of
religion
merging
in
a
faint
expectancy
a
premonition
of
things
to
follow
she
rose
from
her
knees
and
found
an
explanation
of
this
in
the
fact
that
langley
wyndham
was
standing
in
the
opposite
seat
below
the
choir
she
was
not
surprised
for
her
the
unexpected
was
always
about
to
happen
it
had
happened
now
she
tried
not
to
see
or
think
of
him
but
she
felt
him
as
something
illuminating
and
intensifying
her
consciousness
she
heard
the
voice
like
a
fine
music
playing
in
the
background
then
organ
and
choir
burst
into
the
anthem
it
was
a
fugue
the
voices
seemed
to
have
gathered
together
from
the
ends
of
the
world
flying
pursuing
and
flying
doubled
trebled
quadrupled
in
their
flight
they
met
and
parted
they
overtook
and
were
overtaken
and
now
it
was
no
longer
a
fugue
of
sounds
it
was
a
fugue
of
all
sensations
the
incense
rose
and
mingled
with
the
music
the
music
fled
and
rose
up
among
the
clustering
up
to
the
chancel
roof
where
it
lost
itself
in
a
shimmering
labyrinth
of
gold
and
sapphire
and
died
in
a
diminuendo
of
light
and
sound
audrey
looked
up
and
as
her
eyes
met
wyndham
it
seemed
as
if
a
new
and
passionate
theme
had
crashed
into
her
fugue
dominating
its
harmonies
while
the
whole
rushed
on
more
intricate
more
tumultuous
than
before
her
individuality
that
had
swum
with
the
stream
became
fluent
and
coalesced
with
it
now
soul
flooded
with
sense
and
sense
with
soul
she
came
to
herself
exhausted
and
shivering
with
cold
flaxman
reed
was
in
the
pulpit
he
stood
motionless
with
compressed
lips
and
flashing
eyes
as
he
watched
the
last
deserters
softly
filing
out
through
the
the
lights
were
turned
low
in
nave
and
chancel
ted
wriggled
in
his
seat
until
he
commanded
a
good
view
of
the
fine
head
in
faint
relief
against
a
pillar
stone
on
stone
and
flaxman
reed
flung
out
his
text
like
a
challenge
to
the
world
the
things
which
are
seen
are
temporal
but
the
things
which
are
not
seen
are
eternal
the
words
suggested
something
piquantly
metaphysical
magnificently
vague
and
audrey
followed
the
sermon
a
little
way
but
flaxman
reed
was
in
his
austerest
most
militant
mood
he
was
a
master
of
antithesis
and
to
audrey
there
was
something
repellent
in
his
thoughts
his
clear
sentences
no
eloquence
had
any
charm
for
her
that
was
not
as
water
to
reflect
her
image
or
as
wind
to
lift
and
carry
her
along
her
fancy
soon
fluttered
gently
down
to
earth
and
she
caught
herself
wondering
whether
wyndham
would
walk
back
to
piccadilly
or
go
in
a
hansom
she
was
still
pursuing
this
train
of
thought
as
they
left
the
church
when
she
proposed
that
they
should
go
back
to
chelsea
by
westminster
instead
of
lambeth
bridge
wyndham
overtook
them
as
they
turned
down
to
the
river
by
thomas
hospital
he
stopped
while
audrey
pointed
out
the
beauty
of
the
scene
with
her
little
air
of
unique
appreciation
is
it
too
lovely
for
words
the
suggestion
the
mystery
of
it
her
voice
had
a
passionate
impatience
as
if
she
chafed
at
the
limitations
of
the
language
who
says
london
cold
and
grey
it
blue
and
yet
what
would
it
be
without
the
haze
wyndham
smiled
inscrutably
perhaps
he
wondered
what
miss
audrey
craven
would
be
without
the
haze
what
did
you
think
of
the
service
she
asked
presently
by
this
time
she
and
wyndham
were
walking
together
a
little
in
advance
of
the
others
i
did
hear
it
i
was
watching
flaxman
reed
all
the
time
this
statement
as
audrey
well
knew
was
not
strictly
correct
so
was
i
my
uncle
says
if
he
stays
in
the
church
he
be
the
coming
man
the
coming
man
h
he
been
going
back
ever
since
i
knew
him
at
present
he
got
to
the
thirteenth
century
he
may
arrive
at
the
nicene
age
but
he
never
have
a
hold
on
his
own
he
nothing
but
a
holy
anachronism
oh
i
thought
you
did
understand
him
in
one
way
i
do
in
another
i
do
you
see
i
knew
him
at
oxford
when
i
was
a
happy
undergraduate
audrey
could
not
imagine
langley
wyndham
ever
being
an
undergraduate
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
must
always
have
been
a
master
of
arts
i
knew
the
real
flaxman
reed
and
he
was
as
logical
a
sceptic
as
you
or
i
there
was
an
epidemic
of
ideas
in
our
time
and
the
poor
fellow
was
frightened
so
he
took
it
badly
of
course
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
going
to
die
and
he
was
horribly
afraid
of
dying
so
instead
of
talking
about
his
interesting
symptoms
as
you
or
i
might
do
you
or
i
again
that
flattering
association
he
quietly
got
rid
of
the
disease
by
attacking
its
source
how
well
i
forget
the
precise
treatment
but
i
think
he
took
equal
parts
of
augustine
and
thomas
aquinas
diluted
with
he
gave
me
the
prescription
but
i
preferred
the
disease
at
any
rate
he
was
in
earnest
deadly
earnest
that
the
piety
of
the
fraud
you
surely
do
call
him
a
fraud
well
a
is
that
the
completest
and
most
fatal
form
of
fraud
he
fights
and
struggles
to
be
what
he
is
and
calls
it
renouncing
self
he
renounces
the
world
too
and
everything
that
pleasant
i
afraid
that
does
impress
me
i
ca
forget
that
he
renounced
reason
because
it
was
unpleasant
rather
than
bear
a
little
spiritual
neuralgia
he
killed
the
nerve
of
thought
how
terrible
said
audrey
though
she
had
no
very
precise
notion
of
what
was
involved
in
that
operation
to
us
not
to
him
yet
he
talks
about
doing
good
work
for
his
generation
why
should
he
he
works
hard
enough
unfortunately
his
generation
does
want
his
work
or
him
either
too
irrevocably
pledged
to
reality
there
one
thing
about
him
though
his
magnificent
personality
i
believe
he
has
unlimited
influence
over
some
men
and
most
women
audrey
ignored
the
last
suggestion
you
seem
to
find
him
very
interesting
he
is
profoundly
interesting
not
in
himself
so
much
but
in
his
associations
do
you
know
when
i
saw
you
in
church
it
struck
me
that
he
might
possibly
influence
never
i
should
have
to
give
up
my
intellect
first
i
suppose
i
not
prepared
to
do
wyndham
smiled
again
why
what
made
you
think
he
would
influence
me
i
no
right
to
think
anything
at
all
about
it
but
i
know
some
women
take
him
for
a
hierophant
some
women
do
you
think
i
like
them
you
are
like
nothing
but
yourself
i
was
only
afraid
that
he
might
persuade
you
to
renounce
yourself
and
become
somebody
else
which
would
be
a
pity
do
be
alarmed
i
not
so
impressionable
as
you
think
are
you
be
frank
did
you
feel
that
he
might
have
a
revelation
for
you
no
and
yet
it
odd
you
should
say
so
i
have
felt
that
but
not
with
him
i
shall
never
come
under
that
influence
i
hope
not
it
was
delightful
to
have
langley
wyndham
hoping
and
being
afraid
for
her
he
belongs
to
the
dead
you
to
the
living
what
a
thing
it
is
to
have
a
sense
of
style
to
know
the
words
that
consecrate
a
moment
they
were
crossing
westminster
bridge
now
and
audrey
looked
back
on
the
lambeth
end
of
the
bridge
ted
and
katherine
were
leaning
over
the
parapet
she
looked
at
them
as
she
might
have
looked
at
two
figures
in
a
crowd
lambeth
and
teresa
seemed
very
far
away
she
said
so
and
her
tone
implied
that
she
had
left
illusion
behind
her
on
the
surrey
side
wyndham
said
at
westminster
audrey
was
not
quite
pleased
with
his
manner
of
hailing
a
hansom
it
implied
a
conscious
loss
of
valuable
time
what
fools
we
were
to
let
him
catch
us
up
said
ted
as
they
walked
towards
pimlico
audrey
made
no
answer
she
was
saying
to
herself
that
langley
wyndham
had
read
her
and
well
she
hardly
thought
he
would
take
the
trouble
to
read
anything
that
was
not
interesting
chapter
xii
audrey
had
made
a
faint
protest
against
wyndham
realistic
presentation
of
flaxman
reed
in
doing
so
she
was
not
guided
by
any
insight
into
the
character
of
that
divine
or
by
any
sympathy
with
his
aims
indeed
she
could
not
have
understood
him
if
she
had
tried
her
thoughts
had
never
travelled
along
that
avenue
of
time
down
which
wyndham
had
tracked
his
pathetic
figure
to
the
thirteenth
century
she
merely
wanted
to
avoid
a
slavish
acquiescence
in
wyndham
view
to
guard
a
characteristic
intellectual
attitude
intellect
has
its
responsibilities
and
she
was
anxious
to
show
herself
impartial
in
all
this
flaxman
reed
counted
for
nothing
it
was
intolerable
to
her
that
wyndham
should
have
classed
her
even
for
a
moment
with
those
weak
emotional
creatures
who
submitted
to
his
influence
why
he
might
just
as
well
have
said
that
she
was
influenced
by
ted
haviland
the
fact
being
that
no
engaged
woman
ever
preserved
her
independence
more
completely
than
she
had
done
had
devotion
to
ted
interfered
with
her
appreciation
of
wyndham
then
she
reflected
that
wyndham
did
not
know
about
her
engagement
any
more
than
other
people
so
when
flaxman
reed
called
as
he
did
on
monday
afternoon
audrey
met
him
with
a
mind
secure
against
any
malignant
charm
his
most
innocent
remarks
excited
her
suspicion
i
glad
you
found
your
way
to
teresa
we
do
often
get
such
a
strong
contingent
from
the
other
side
by
the
other
side
reed
meant
middlesex
but
to
audrey
the
phrase
was
insidiously
controversial
she
determined
to
take
her
stand
once
and
for
all
i
afraid
my
heterodoxy
is
incorrigible
so
i
should
say
is
langley
wyndham
the
vicar
raised
his
eyebrows
in
mild
surprise
i
do
know
why
came
unless
it
was
for
old
acquaintance
sake
ah
you
knew
him
did
you
do
tell
me
about
him
he
public
property
you
know
i
daresay
but
i
have
no
right
to
discuss
him
we
hardly
ever
meet
now
if
we
did
we
should
agree
we
are
enigmas
to
each
other
yes
she
said
meditatively
and
with
a
faint
reproduction
of
manner
i
should
say
you
would
be
he
belongs
so
essentially
to
the
present
do
you
think
flaxman
reed
flushed
painfully
and
i
to
the
past
is
that
what
you
mean
yes
i
think
i
do
you
may
be
right
i
suppose
he
is
very
modern
a
decadent
who
would
rather
die
with
his
day
than
live
an
hour
behind
it
who
ca
see
that
the
future
may
have
more
kindred
with
the
past
than
with
the
present
mind
you
i
not
talking
of
him
but
of
his
school
then
you
read
him
of
course
everybody
reads
him
i
not
much
time
for
any
reading
that
lies
outside
my
work
but
i
read
his
first
book
when
it
came
out
is
it
from
him
you
get
what
you
call
your
heterodoxy
no
you
have
to
think
these
things
out
for
yourself
audrey
was
led
into
making
this
statement
simply
by
the
desire
to
please
that
eternally
feminine
instinct
told
her
that
at
the
moment
she
would
be
most
interesting
to
flaxman
reed
in
the
character
of
a
forlorn
sceptic
his
face
sharpened
with
a
sudden
distrust
what
have
got
the
malady
of
the
century
the
disease
of
thought
surely
this
is
something
new
it
is
one
ca
go
on
for
ever
in
the
old
grooves
one
must
think
yes
that
curse
is
laid
upon
us
for
our
sins
audrey
smiled
a
bitter
smile
as
much
as
to
say
that
she
must
have
committed
some
awful
crime
to
be
so
tormented
with
intellect
as
she
was
i
suppose
he
continued
guilelessly
every
earnest
mind
must
go
through
this
sooner
or
later
yes
but
i
come
out
on
what
you
call
the
other
side
i
ca
go
back
can
i
no
but
you
can
go
round
audrey
shook
her
head
sadly
feeling
all
the
time
how
nice
it
was
to
be
taken
seriously
why
not
why
not
compromise
what
is
life
but
compromise
what
else
is
my
own
position
as
an
anglican
priest
i
daresay
you
know
that
my
heart
is
not
altogether
with
the
church
i
serve
he
checked
himself
he
had
not
meant
to
strike
this
personal
note
and
how
could
he
explain
the
yearning
of
his
heart
for
the
great
heart
of
the
this
would
have
been
possible
last
year
at
oxford
but
not
now
i
tell
you
this
because
i
feel
that
it
might
perhaps
help
you
no
i
know
what
you
will
say
next
you
will
tell
me
to
stop
thinking
because
it
hurts
me
i
wo
you
will
go
on
thinking
in
spite
of
me
but
your
intellect
will
be
feeding
on
itself
you
will
get
no
farther
thought
can
never
be
satisfied
with
thought
flaxman
reed
was
only
a
simple
priest
but
wyndham
himself
could
not
have
chosen
words
more
subtly
calculated
to
establish
the
influence
to
have
two
such
champions
battling
for
possession
of
her
soul
was
exciting
enough
in
all
conscience
but
she
was
inexpressibly
flattered
by
that
dramatic
conception
of
herself
as
a
restless
intellect
struggling
with
the
storms
of
doubt
it
would
be
hard
to
say
how
flaxman
reed
came
to
believe
in
any
real
passion
of
thought
behind
spiritual
coquetry
his
ministration
to
a
living
illusion
was
almost
as
touching
as
his
devotion
to
a
dead
ideal
but
audrey
herself
was
too
completely
the
thrall
of
the
illusion
to
feel
compunction
there
was
no
voice
to
warn
him
that
his
enthusiasm
was
the
prey
of
the
eternal
vanity
he
leaned
back
in
his
meditative
hieratic
attitude
his
elbows
resting
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
his
thin
hands
joined
at
the
wondering
what
he
should
say
to
help
her
after
all
audrey
had
stated
her
case
a
little
vaguely
there
was
a
reticence
as
to
details
these
however
he
easily
supplied
from
his
own
experience
supposing
hers
to
have
been
more
or
less
like
it
he
said
he
wished
he
had
known
of
this
before
that
he
had
spoken
sooner
wincing
perceptibly
as
audrey
pointed
out
the
inexpediency
of
discussing
eternal
things
on
so
temporal
an
occasion
as
her
he
did
not
mean
that
his
time
now
was
short
he
had
a
stupid
parish
meeting
at
five
he
went
rapidly
over
the
ground
past
immemorial
of
thought
refuting
current
theories
suggesting
lines
of
reading
in
his
excitement
he
even
recommended
some
slight
study
of
patristics
there
was
nothing
like
getting
to
the
sources
polycarp
and
irenæus
were
important
or
he
could
lend
her
lightfoot
but
he
did
not
want
to
overwhelm
her
with
dogmas
mere
matter
for
the
intellect
he
would
prefer
her
to
accept
some
truths
provisionally
and
see
how
they
worked
out
after
all
the
working
out
was
everything
he
wanted
her
to
see
that
it
was
a
question
of
will
in
the
crisis
of
his
own
life
he
had
helped
himself
most
by
helping
others
practically
he
meant
seeing
after
his
poor
people
and
so
on
did
she
think
it
might
be
the
same
with
her
audrey
looked
grave
it
was
good
to
be
taken
seriously
but
this
was
going
a
little
too
far
did
she
think
she
could
do
something
other
ladies
flaxman
reed
was
doing
well
very
well
indeed
but
he
had
spoiled
it
all
by
that
hopelessly
inartistic
touch
any
man
of
the
world
could
have
told
him
that
to
mention
other
ladies
to
audrey
to
take
her
out
of
the
circle
of
supreme
intelligences
in
which
he
had
placed
her
ten
minutes
ago
and
to
confuse
her
with
the
rank
and
file
of
parochial
underlings
and
was
death
to
the
influence
it
was
an
insult
to
her
glorious
womanhood
some
people
might
even
have
objected
that
such
crass
ignorance
of
the
world
he
renounced
detracted
from
the
merit
of
the
renunciation
her
voice
was
very
cold
and
distant
as
she
answered
him
what
do
you
suppose
i
could
do
if
you
mean
slumming
i
never
been
down
a
slum
in
my
life
no
he
did
mean
slumming
exactly
to
tell
the
truth
he
could
not
fancy
audrey
mingling
with
the
brutal
side
of
life
he
would
have
shrunk
from
giving
her
work
that
he
committed
without
a
pang
to
his
deaconesses
and
sisters
do
you
mean
mothers
meetings
then
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
no
he
did
mean
mothers
meetings
either
but
he
thought
she
might
like
to
come
sometimes
to
their
social
evenings
social
evenings
that
was
worse
than
all
he
had
plunged
in
his
nervousness
to
the
lowermost
bathos
audrey
saw
that
he
looked
puzzled
and
disheartened
she
crossed
over
to
her
wrote
out
a
cheque
for
five
pounds
and
gave
it
to
him
with
the
prettiest
action
in
the
world
i
want
you
to
take
that
for
your
poor
people
i
wish
i
could
help
in
some
other
way
but
i
ca
i
am
so
sorry
the
apology
was
sweetness
itself
but
she
had
the
air
of
having
settled
her
account
with
humanity
and
him
he
thanked
her
gravely
and
took
his
leave
reminding
her
that
whenever
she
needed
his
help
it
would
still
be
there
she
remained
musing
some
time
after
he
had
gone
he
little
guessed
how
nearly
he
had
won
the
victory
perhaps
he
would
have
scorned
any
advantage
gained
by
an
appeal
to
her
sex
though
he
had
conceded
much
to
it
more
than
he
well
knew
chapter
xiii
august
was
a
miserable
month
for
katherine
in
the
hot
attic
hard
at
work
on
her
own
pictures
and
too
often
finishing
the
various
orders
for
black
and
white
which
knowles
had
after
all
managed
to
put
in
ted
way
she
could
have
stood
the
hard
work
if
she
had
not
been
more
than
ever
worried
on
ted
account
with
her
feminine
instinct
sharpened
by
affection
she
foresaw
trouble
at
hand
complications
which
it
would
never
have
entered
into
the
boy
head
to
consider
for
reasons
of
her
own
audrey
was
still
keeping
her
engagement
a
secret
she
was
less
regular
too
in
making
appointments
fixing
days
for
ted
to
go
over
and
see
her
and
more
often
than
not
he
missed
her
if
he
happened
to
call
at
chelsea
gardens
of
his
own
accord
at
the
same
time
she
came
to
devon
street
as
often
as
or
oftener
than
ever
and
there
her
manner
to
ted
had
all
its
old
charm
with
something
added
it
was
more
deeply
more
seriously
affectionate
than
before
and
yet
it
was
just
in
these
tender
passages
that
katherine
detected
the
change
of
key
that
tenderness
was
not
remorse
as
she
might
have
supposed
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
past
being
purely
an
emotion
of
the
passing
moment
audrey
was
playing
a
new
part
her
mind
was
swayed
by
a
fresh
current
of
ideas
it
had
suffered
the
invasion
of
a
foreign
personality
the
evidence
for
this
was
purely
psychological
but
it
all
pointed
one
way
a
sudden
display
of
new
interests
a
startling
phrase
a
word
hitherto
unknown
in
audrey
vocabulary
her
way
of
handling
a
book
the
alternate
excitement
and
preoccupation
of
her
manner
they
were
all
unmistakable
katherine
had
noticed
the
same
signs
in
the
days
of
audrey
first
absorption
in
ted
she
had
caught
his
tricks
his
idioms
his
way
of
thinking
she
had
even
begun
to
see
like
ted
the
humour
of
things
and
to
make
reckless
speeches
not
quite
like
ted
that
shocked
cousin
bella
sense
of
propriety
katherine
had
smiled
at
her
innocent
plagiarism
and
wondered
at
the
transforming
power
of
love
and
now
audrey
was
actually
undergoing
another
metempsychosis
under
whose
influence
here
again
katherine
instinct
was
correct
it
was
presence
that
in
three
weeks
had
brought
about
the
change
yes
in
that
impressive
affection
in
the
pleading
tremor
of
her
voice
in
her
smiles
and
caresses
audrey
was
acting
a
part
before
one
invisible
spectator
she
played
as
if
wyndham
were
standing
by
and
looking
on
her
love
for
ted
had
been
a
reality
therefore
it
served
as
a
standard
to
measure
all
emotions
by
it
made
this
new
passion
of
the
imagination
a
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
no
wonder
that
she
would
not
announce
her
engagement
at
the
best
of
times
her
fluent
nature
shrank
from
everything
that
was
fixed
and
irrevocable
above
all
from
the
act
of
will
that
trammelled
her
wandering
fancy
the
finality
that
limited
her
outlook
upon
life
and
now
it
was
impossible
the
three
weeks
in
which
she
had
known
wyndham
had
shown
her
that
compared
with
that
complex
character
that
finished
intellect
ted
was
indeed
little
better
than
a
baby
not
that
she
could
have
done
without
ted
far
from
it
as
yet
wyndham
was
still
the
unknown
shadowy
and
unapproachable
the
touch
of
hand
seemed
to
make
him
living
to
bring
him
nearer
to
her
ted
still
stood
between
her
and
the
void
where
there
is
no
more
revelation
no
hope
no
love
and
hardy
would
be
in
london
in
another
week
katherine
had
not
guessed
all
the
truth
any
more
than
audrey
had
herself
but
she
had
guessed
enough
to
make
her
extremely
anxious
audrey
was
not
the
wife
she
could
have
wished
for
ted
she
disapproved
of
his
marriage
with
her
as
a
certain
hindrance
to
his
career
but
above
all
she
dreaded
for
him
the
agony
of
disappointment
which
must
follow
if
audrey
gave
him
up
she
had
no
very
clear
idea
of
what
it
would
mean
to
him
but
judging
his
nature
by
what
she
had
seen
of
it
she
feared
some
shock
either
to
his
moral
system
or
to
his
artistic
powers
she
longed
to
speak
to
him
about
it
but
ted
and
she
were
not
accustomed
to
handling
their
emotions
and
of
late
they
had
avoided
all
personal
questions
not
susceptible
of
humorous
treatment
after
this
persistent
choosing
of
the
shallows
she
shrank
from
a
sudden
plunge
into
the
depths
she
felt
strongly
and
with
her
strong
feeling
was
a
bar
to
utterance
at
last
an
incident
occurred
which
laid
the
subject
open
to
frivolous
discussion
katherine
was
painting
one
afternoon
and
ted
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
which
looked
to
chelsea
his
thoughts
travelling
in
a
towards
the
little
brown
house
suddenly
he
drew
his
head
in
with
an
exclamation
uncle
james
by
jove
he
be
upon
us
in
another
minute
i
off
and
he
made
a
rush
for
his
bedroom
katherine
had
only
time
to
wipe
the
paint
from
her
brush
to
throw
a
tablecloth
over
the
apollo
and
a
mackintosh
over
the
divine
shoulders
of
the
venus
pigott
was
a
purist
in
art
and
katherine
respected
his
prejudices
when
her
uncle
arrived
panting
and
inarticulate
well
uncle
this
is
a
surprise
how
are
you
no
better
for
climbing
up
that
precipice
of
yours
what
on
earth
possessed
you
to
come
to
this
hole
it
a
good
room
for
painting
you
see
that
could
you
find
a
good
room
in
west
kensington
instead
of
planting
yourself
up
here
away
from
us
all
this
was
a
standing
grievance
as
katherine
knew
well
you
see
it
nicer
here
by
the
river
and
it
cheaper
too
and
how
aunt
kate
your
aunt
kate
has
got
a
stye
in
her
eye
dear
me
i
very
sorry
to
hear
it
and
you
uncle
poorly
very
poorly
i
ought
not
to
have
got
out
of
my
bed
one
of
my
old
attacks
my
liver
never
been
the
same
since
i
caught
that
bad
chill
at
your
father
funeral
uncle
james
looked
at
katherine
severely
as
if
she
had
been
to
blame
for
the
calamity
his
feeling
was
natural
one
way
or
another
the
havilands
had
been
the
cause
of
calamity
in
the
family
ever
since
they
came
into
it
family
worship
and
the
worship
of
the
family
were
different
but
equally
indispensable
forms
of
the
one
true
religion
the
stigma
of
schism
if
not
of
atheism
attached
to
the
havilands
in
departing
from
the
old
traditions
and
forming
a
little
sect
by
themselves
pigott
meant
well
by
them
at
any
time
he
would
have
helped
them
substantially
in
such
a
manner
as
he
thought
fit
but
one
and
all
the
havilands
had
refused
to
be
benefited
in
any
way
but
their
own
their
own
way
in
the
pigotts
opinion
being
invariably
a
foolish
one
between
you
and
me
sir
they
had
a
sound
business
head
among
them
as
for
ted
and
katherine
before
the
day
when
he
had
washed
his
hands
of
ted
in
the
office
lavatory
uncle
james
had
tried
to
play
the
part
of
an
overruling
providence
in
their
affairs
and
the
young
infidels
had
signified
their
utter
disbelief
in
him
since
then
he
had
ceased
to
interfere
with
his
creatures
and
latterly
his
finger
was
only
to
be
seen
at
times
of
marked
crisis
or
disturbance
as
in
the
arrangements
for
a
marriage
or
a
funeral
an
astounding
piece
of
news
had
come
to
his
ears
which
was
the
reason
of
his
present
visitation
he
hastened
to
the
business
in
hand
what
this
that
i
hear
about
ted
eh
i
do
know
said
katherine
blushing
violently
i
told
that
he
taken
up
with
some
woman
nobody
knows
who
and
that
they
seen
everywhere
together
told
you
this
your
cousin
nettie
she
seen
them
constantly
in
the
national
gallery
and
the
british
museum
carrying
on
all
the
time
pretending
to
look
at
those
heathen
gods
and
goddesses
katherine
glanced
nervously
round
the
studio
they
actually
make
assignations
they
meet
on
the
steps
of
public
places
nettie
has
noticed
her
hanging
about
waiting
for
him
and
some
young
friends
of
hers
saw
them
dining
together
alone
at
the
star
and
garter
now
the
meaning
of
all
this
katherine
was
too
much
amused
to
answer
yet
she
wanted
to
see
what
her
uncle
would
say
next
he
shook
his
head
solemnly
i
knew
what
it
would
be
when
you
two
had
it
all
your
own
way
as
for
you
katherine
you
took
a
very
grave
responsibility
on
your
shoulders
when
you
persuaded
your
young
brother
to
live
with
you
here
in
this
neighbourhood
away
from
all
your
relations
your
influence
has
been
for
anything
but
good
my
dear
uncle
you
are
so
funny
but
you
mistaken
i
know
miss
craven
the
lady
you
mean
perfectly
well
she
and
ted
are
great
friends
and
it
all
right
i
assure
you
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
he
is
engaged
to
this
young
lady
he
goes
about
with
katherine
hesitated
if
she
had
felt
inclined
to
gratify
a
curiosity
which
she
considered
impertinent
she
was
not
at
liberty
to
betray
their
secret
i
ca
tell
you
that
for
i
not
supposed
to
know
let
me
tell
you
then
that
it
looks
bad
very
bad
to
begin
with
your
cousin
nettie
strongly
disapproves
of
the
young
woman
appearance
so
loud
and
evidently
got
up
to
attract
but
it
lies
in
a
nutshell
if
he
not
engaged
to
her
why
is
he
seen
everywhere
with
her
if
he
is
engaged
to
her
and
she
a
respectable
woman
i
say
she
respectable
why
does
he
introduce
her
to
his
family
why
does
he
ask
your
aunt
kate
to
call
on
her
well
you
see
supposing
they
are
engaged
they
would
go
and
proclaim
it
all
at
once
and
in
any
case
that
would
depend
more
on
miss
craven
than
ted
i
ca
tell
you
any
more
than
i
have
done
and
i
be
greatly
obliged
if
you
would
allow
ted
affairs
to
be
gossiped
about
by
cousin
nettie
or
anybody
else
she
was
relieved
for
the
moment
by
the
entrance
of
rogers
with
the
tea
uncle
no
thank
you
none
of
your
i
must
see
ted
himself
where
is
he
i
not
sure
but
i
he
gone
out
rogers
looked
up
from
her
tray
pleased
to
give
valuable
information
is
in
bedroom
m
i
as
i
come
up
oh
i
go
and
tell
him
then
she
found
ted
dressing
himself
carefully
before
calling
on
audrey
she
wasted
five
minutes
in
trying
to
persuade
him
to
see
his
uncle
ted
was
firm
give
him
my
very
kindest
regards
and
tell
him
a
pressing
engagement
alone
prevents
my
waiting
on
him
with
that
he
ran
merrily
downstairs
his
feet
carried
him
very
swiftly
towards
audrey
katherine
gave
the
message
with
some
modifications
and
pigott
seeing
that
no
good
was
to
be
gained
by
staying
took
his
leave
ted
came
back
sooner
than
his
sister
had
expected
he
smiled
faintly
at
the
absurd
appearance
of
the
venus
in
her
mackintosh
but
he
was
evidently
depressed
he
looked
mournfully
at
the
i
afraid
the
tea
poison
ted
and
it
cold
it
does
matter
i
do
want
any
had
tea
at
audrey
no
he
strode
impatiently
to
the
table
and
took
up
one
of
the
illustrations
katherine
had
been
working
at
what
up
said
she
oh
er
for
one
thing
i
heard
from
the
editor
of
the
illustrated
he
in
a
beastly
bad
temper
and
says
my
last
batch
of
illustrations
is
funny
enough
the
old
duffer
bringing
out
a
religious
serial
and
he
must
have
humour
to
make
it
go
down
katherine
was
relieved
to
divert
him
she
told
him
the
family
opinion
as
to
his
relations
with
audrey
that
raised
his
spirits
so
far
that
he
called
his
uncle
a
fantastic
old
gander
and
his
cousin
nettie
an
little
beast
after
all
ted
said
katherine
judicially
why
does
audrey
go
on
making
a
mystery
of
your
engagement
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
said
ted
savagely
surely
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
that
harmless
person
the
editor
of
the
sunday
illustrated
to
move
him
so
something
must
have
happened
what
had
happened
was
this
as
ted
was
going
into
the
little
brown
house
at
chelsea
he
had
met
langley
wyndham
coming
out
of
it
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
found
audrey
in
a
bad
temper
she
was
annoyed
in
the
first
place
because
the
novelist
had
been
unable
to
stay
to
tea
she
had
provided
a
chocolate
cake
on
purpose
the
eminent
man
having
once
approved
of
that
delicacy
it
was
a
pretty
way
audrey
had
this
remembering
the
likings
of
her
friends
she
was
also
annoyed
because
ted
coming
had
followed
so
immediately
on
wyndham
going
it
was
her
habit
now
whenever
she
had
seen
wyndham
to
pass
from
the
reality
of
his
presence
into
a
reverie
which
revived
the
sense
of
it
and
ted
arrival
had
interfered
with
this
pastime
the
first
thing
the
boy
did
too
was
to
wound
her
tenderest
susceptibilities
he
began
playing
with
the
books
that
lay
beside
her
what
a
literary
cat
it
is
she
frowned
and
drew
in
her
breath
quickly
as
if
in
pain
he
went
on
turning
over
the
pages
it
was
wyndham
london
legends
with
irreverent
fingers
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
said
audrey
to
ted
and
stopped
short
what
would
you
very
much
like
to
know
puss
what
you
saw
in
me
to
begin
with
i
have
the
remotest
idea
unless
it
was
your
intellect
i
should
also
like
to
know
said
audrey
to
the
teapot
why
people
fall
in
love
the
taste
is
either
natural
or
acquired
some
take
to
it
because
they
like
it
some
are
driven
to
it
by
a
hereditary
tendency
or
an
unhappy
home
i
do
it
myself
to
drown
care
will
you
have
any
tea
asked
audrey
sternly
no
thank
you
i
wo
she
laughed
as
she
might
have
laughed
at
a
greedy
child
for
revenging
on
its
stomach
the
injury
done
to
its
heart
poor
ted
he
was
fond
of
chocolate
cake
too
she
would
have
given
anything
at
that
moment
if
she
could
have
provoked
him
into
quarrelling
with
her
instead
of
quarrelling
he
stroked
her
beautiful
hair
as
if
she
had
been
some
soft
but
irritable
animal
he
said
he
was
sure
her
dear
little
head
was
aching
because
she
was
so
he
implored
her
not
to
eat
too
much
cake
and
promised
to
call
again
another
day
when
he
hoped
to
find
her
better
so
he
left
her
and
went
home
with
a
dead
weight
at
his
heart
towards
evening
his
misery
became
so
acute
that
he
could
no
longer
keep
it
to
himself
they
were
on
the
leads
in
the
long
august
twilight
katherine
sitting
with
her
back
against
the
tall
chimney
watching
the
reflection
of
the
sunset
in
the
east
the
boy
lying
at
her
feet
with
his
heels
in
the
air
and
his
head
in
the
nasturtiums
the
time
the
place
the
attitude
were
all
favourable
to
confidences
and
ted
wound
up
his
by
asking
katherine
what
she
thought
of
audrey
now
was
the
moment
to
rid
herself
of
the
burden
that
weighed
on
her
ted
might
never
be
in
so
favourable
a
mood
again
she
spoke
very
gently
ted
i
am
going
to
hurt
your
feelings
i
do
quite
know
how
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
her
she
not
good
enough
for
you
to
begin
with
i
know
she
not
intelligent
she
ca
help
that
and
she
not
affectionate
oh
ted
forgive
me
but
she
does
love
you
she
ca
it
not
in
her
she
loves
no
one
but
herself
she
a
little
selfish
but
she
ca
help
that
either
it
makes
no
difference
so
i
fear
and
then
she
years
older
than
you
are
and
you
ca
marry
for
ages
do
you
see
how
impossible
it
all
is
her
voice
thrilled
with
her
longing
to
impress
him
with
her
own
conviction
his
passion
was
wrestling
with
a
ghastly
doubt
but
it
was
of
the
kind
that
dies
hard
of
course
it
quite
impossible
now
neither
he
nor
katherine
considered
the
question
of
audrey
money
they
had
never
thought
of
it
but
as
she
said
herself
in
five
years
time
when
she
thirty
and
i
the
difference
in
our
ages
wo
be
so
marked
it
will
be
as
marked
as
ever
even
if
your
intellect
grows
at
its
present
rate
of
development
i
admitted
that
she
a
little
deficient
in
parts
and
as
you
justly
observe
stupidity
like
death
is
levelling
we
should
suit
each
other
exactly
in
time
ah
if
you
can
see
that
why
oh
why
did
you
fall
in
love
with
her
asked
me
that
this
afternoon
i
said
it
was
because
she
was
so
clever
it
was
because
i
was
a
fool
stupidity
came
upon
me
like
a
madness
i
wish
to
heaven
i
never
done
it
it
played
the
devil
with
my
chances
i
was
sitting
calmly
on
the
highroad
to
success
with
my
and
my
little
portable
easel
not
interfering
in
the
least
with
the
traffic
when
she
came
along
like
a
knocked
me
down
crushed
me
and
rolled
me
out
flat
i
shall
never
recover
my
natural
shape
and
as
for
the
and
the
portable
easel
these
things
are
an
allegory
but
i
love
her
all
the
same
katherine
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
but
she
understood
the
allegory
would
he
ever
recover
his
natural
shape
to
that
end
she
was
determined
to
make
him
face
the
worst
ted
what
would
you
do
supposing
only
supposing
she
were
to
fling
you
over
for
for
some
one
else
i
should
blow
my
brains
out
if
i
had
any
left
verdict
suicide
while
in
a
state
of
temporary
insanity
suicide
of
a
genius
that
would
be
a
fine
feather
in
audrey
cap
she
always
had
exquisite
taste
in
dress
besides
she
welcome
to
it
or
to
any
little
trifle
of
the
kind
it
was
useless
attempting
to
make
any
impression
on
him
she
gave
it
up
ted
however
was
so
charmed
with
the
idea
of
suicide
that
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
discussing
ways
and
means
he
was
not
going
to
blow
his
brains
out
or
to
take
poison
in
his
bedroom
or
do
anything
disagreeable
that
would
depreciate
rogers
property
on
the
whole
drowning
was
the
cheapest
and
would
suit
him
best
if
he
could
summon
up
spirits
for
it
only
he
did
want
to
spoil
the
river
for
it
must
be
somewhere
below
london
bridge
say
wapping
old
stairs
here
katherine
suggested
that
he
had
better
go
to
bed
he
went
and
lay
awake
all
night
in
a
when
katherine
went
into
his
room
the
next
morning
ten
had
struck
and
there
was
no
appearance
of
ted
she
found
him
lying
in
a
deep
sleep
one
arm
was
flung
outside
the
counterpane
the
hand
had
closed
on
a
crumpled
sheet
of
paper
it
was
audrey
last
note
of
invitation
the
baby
had
taken
it
to
bed
with
him
poor
boy
poor
poor
ted
but
for
all
her
sympathy
love
the
stupidity
that
comes
on
you
like
a
madness
was
a
thing
incomprehensible
to
katherine
chapter
xiv
the
next
day
audrey
head
was
aching
to
some
purpose
she
had
been
going
through
a
course
of
langley
wyndham
yesterday
he
had
brought
her
his
last
book
london
legends
and
she
had
sat
up
half
the
night
to
read
it
she
was
to
tell
him
what
she
thought
of
it
and
her
ideas
were
in
a
whirl
she
stayed
in
bed
for
breakfast
excused
herself
from
lunch
left
word
with
the
footman
that
she
was
not
at
home
that
afternoon
and
sent
down
another
message
five
minutes
afterwards
that
if
by
any
chance
wyndham
were
to
call
he
might
be
admitted
not
that
he
in
the
least
likely
to
come
after
being
here
yesterday
she
said
to
herself
and
yet
as
she
sat
alone
in
the
drawing
room
she
listened
for
the
ringing
of
bells
the
opening
of
doors
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
every
five
minutes
she
looked
at
the
clock
and
her
heart
kept
time
to
its
ticking
two
in
any
case
he
would
come
before
three
and
yet
surely
that
was
the
bell
no
three
four
he
would
be
more
likely
to
drop
in
about
five
tea
came
in
on
the
stroke
of
it
and
still
no
wyndham
five
he
had
once
called
later
than
that
when
he
wanted
to
find
her
alone
something
told
her
that
he
would
come
he
would
be
anxious
to
know
what
she
thought
of
his
book
she
was
in
that
state
of
mind
when
people
trust
in
intuitions
failing
positive
evidence
surely
in
some
past
state
of
existence
she
had
sat
in
that
chair
surrounded
by
the
same
objects
thinking
the
same
thoughts
and
that
train
of
ideas
had
been
completed
by
the
arrival
of
wyndham
science
accounts
for
this
sensation
by
supposing
that
one
half
of
the
brain
more
agile
than
another
jumps
to
its
conclusion
before
its
tardier
fellow
can
arrive
to
audrey
it
was
a
prophecy
certain
of
fulfilment
and
all
the
time
her
head
kept
on
aching
the
poor
little
brain
went
on
wandering
in
a
maze
of
its
own
making
how
truly
she
had
in
cousin
bella
phrase
entangled
herself
with
hardy
with
ted
and
possibly
nay
probably
with
wyndham
she
saw
no
escape
from
the
dreadful
situation
and
as
a
dark
background
to
her
thoughts
there
hung
the
shadow
of
hardy
return
she
only
realised
it
in
these
moods
of
reaction
that
followed
the
exaltation
of
the
last
three
weeks
and
to
make
matters
worse
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
dissatisfied
with
herself
not
that
she
was
in
the
least
aware
of
the
deterioration
of
her
character
she
took
no
count
of
the
endless
little
meannesses
and
falsehoods
which
she
was
driven
into
by
her
position
simple
straightforward
action
was
impossible
this
much
was
evident
to
her
that
whatever
course
she
took
now
she
must
end
by
forfeiting
some
good
opinion
hardy
first
well
she
could
get
over
that
but
ted
katherine
wyndham
if
he
came
to
know
everything
it
was
there
in
that
last
possibility
that
she
suffered
most
six
she
had
given
up
wyndham
and
her
belief
in
psychical
prophecy
and
was
trying
to
find
relief
from
unpleasant
reflections
in
a
book
when
wyndham
actually
appeared
he
came
in
with
the
confident
smile
of
the
friend
sure
of
a
welcome
at
all
hours
forgive
my
calling
at
this
unholy
time
i
knew
if
i
came
earlier
i
should
find
you
surrounded
by
an
admiring
crowd
i
wanted
to
see
you
alone
quite
right
i
am
always
at
home
to
friends
they
dropped
into
one
of
those
trivial
dialogues
which
were
despair
in
her
intercourse
with
wyndham
suddenly
his
tone
changed
he
took
up
london
legends
as
you
already
guessed
my
egregious
vanity
brings
me
here
i
know
whether
you
had
time
to
look
at
the
thing
i
sat
up
to
finish
it
last
night
indeed
what
did
you
think
of
it
do
ask
me
i
did
criticise
sympathy
comes
first
excuse
me
it
does
criticism
comes
first
with
all
of
us
sympathy
comes
last
of
all
when
we
know
the
whole
of
life
and
understand
it
what
would
my
poor
little
opinion
be
worth
everything
a
really
unbiassed
judgment
is
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
and
there
always
a
charm
about
naïve
criticism
i
could
put
the
book
down
can
i
say
more
yes
of
course
you
can
say
more
you
can
tell
me
which
legend
you
disliked
least
you
can
criticise
my
hero
conduct
and
find
fault
with
my
heroine
manners
you
can
object
to
my
plot
pick
holes
in
my
style
no
thank
goodness
you
ca
do
that
but
you
can
take
exception
to
my
morality
she
sat
silent
waiting
for
her
cue
and
trying
to
collect
her
thoughts
which
were
fluttering
all
abroad
in
generalities
he
went
on
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
his
voice
i
thought
so
it
the
old
my
morality
if
it
been
for
that
you
would
have
told
me
would
you
that
my
figures
breathe
and
move
that
every
touch
is
true
to
life
but
you
dare
you
are
afraid
of
reality
facts
are
so
immoral
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
accent
of
scorn
which
wyndham
threw
into
this
last
word
i
thought
your
book
very
clever
in
spite
of
the
facts
facts
or
no
facts
you
rather
have
your
beliefs
would
you
no
no
i
lost
them
all
long
ago
cried
audrey
indignantly
i
do
mean
the
old
vulgar
dogmas
of
course
but
the
dear
little
ideals
that
shed
such
a
rosy
light
on
things
in
general
you
know
ah
that
what
you
want
and
when
an
artist
paints
the
real
thing
for
you
you
say
you
yes
it
very
clever
i
see
but
i
prefer
the
pretty
views
and
the
limelight
of
life
not
at
all
i
much
too
great
a
regard
for
truth
i
know
you
always
looking
for
truth
with
a
capital
t
but
when
it
comes
to
the
point
you
rather
have
two
miserable
little
than
one
honest
whole
truth
about
anything
that
why
you
disliked
my
book
i
did
oh
yes
you
did
what
you
disliked
about
it
was
this
it
made
you
see
men
and
women
not
as
you
imagined
them
but
as
god
made
them
you
saw
that
is
the
naked
human
soul
stripped
of
the
clumsy
draperies
that
puritanism
wraps
round
it
you
saw
below
the
surface
below
the
of
education
below
the
solid
layer
of
traditional
morality
deep
down
to
the
primitive
passions
the
fire
of
the
clay
we
all
made
of
you
saw
love
and
hate
forces
which
are
older
than
all
religions
and
all
laws
older
than
man
and
woman
and
which
make
men
and
women
what
they
are
and
they
seemed
to
you
not
commonplaces
which
they
are
but
something
worse
you
do
know
that
these
are
the
stuff
of
art
because
they
are
the
stuff
of
nature
that
it
takes
multitudes
of
such
facts
not
just
one
or
two
picked
out
because
of
their
beauty
for
you
purists
believe
in
the
beauty
of
morality
as
well
as
in
the
immorality
of
beauty
to
make
up
a
faithful
picture
of
life
and
you
shuddered
did
you
as
you
laid
down
the
book
you
sat
up
half
the
night
to
read
and
you
said
it
was
ugly
revolting
you
could
see
any
perfect
characters
in
it
only
character
in
the
making
only
wretched
men
and
women
acting
according
to
certain
disagreeable
laws
which
are
none
the
less
immutable
because
one
half
of
the
world
professes
to
ignore
their
existence
you
said
away
the
whole
world
of
nature
take
away
logic
and
science
and
art
but
leave
me
leave
me
my
ideals
is
that
it
the
torrent
of
his
rhetoric
swept
her
away
she
knew
not
whither
but
in
his
last
words
she
had
caught
her
cue
if
she
was
ever
to
be
an
influence
in
wyndham
life
encouraging
inspiring
his
best
work
she
must
not
suffer
him
to
speak
lightly
of
ideals
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
methods
with
ted
were
crude
compared
with
her
management
of
wyndham
oh
do
do
it
dreadful
but
you
are
right
i
ca
live
without
ideals
all
the
great
artists
had
them
you
have
them
yourself
or
at
least
you
them
i
do
know
what
to
think
about
your
book
i
ca
think
i
can
only
feel
and
i
read
between
the
lines
surely
you
feel
with
me
that
there
nothing
worth
living
for
except
morality
surely
you
believe
in
purity
and
goodness
her
face
was
flushed
her
hands
were
clasped
tightly
together
in
her
intensity
so
strong
was
the
illusion
her
manner
produced
that
for
one
second
wyndham
could
have
been
convinced
of
her
absolute
sincerity
not
long
no
not
long
afterwards
her
words
were
to
come
back
to
him
with
irony
morality
i
the
greatest
respect
for
it
but
after
all
its
rules
only
mark
off
one
little
corner
from
the
plain
of
life
out
there
in
the
open
are
the
fine
landscapes
and
the
great
highroads
of
thought
and
if
you
are
to
travel
at
all
you
must
go
by
those
ways
there
dust
on
them
and
there
mud
plenty
of
mud
but
there
are
no
others
i
would
be
very
careful
where
i
put
my
feet
though
i
do
like
muddy
boots
i
daresay
not
who
does
but
the
traveller
is
not
always
thinking
about
his
boots
do
let
talk
about
boots
she
made
a
little
movement
with
her
mouth
simulating
disgust
your
own
metaphor
but
never
mind
propos
des
i
should
like
he
broke
off
and
added
in
a
deep
hieratic
voice
to
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
but
to
the
puritan
most
things
are
impure
i
wish
i
could
make
you
see
that
but
it
a
large
subject
and
besides
i
want
to
talk
about
you
me
yes
you
with
all
your
beliefs
there
was
a
time
if
i
not
much
mistaken
when
you
were
pleased
to
doubt
the
existence
of
your
charming
self
she
looked
up
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
and
of
perfect
comprehension
he
could
hardly
have
said
anything
more
delicately
caressing
to
her
it
seemed
then
that
every
word
she
had
uttered
in
his
hearing
had
been
weighed
and
treasured
up
she
could
hardly
be
supposed
to
know
that
this
power
of
noticing
and
preserving
such
little
personal
details
was
one
of
the
functions
of
the
literary
organism
if
a
woman
like
miss
fraser
had
been
flattered
by
it
what
must
have
been
its
effect
on
the
susceptible
audrey
so
you
remember
that
too
she
said
softly
yes
it
impressed
me
at
the
time
now
i
know
you
better
i
do
wonder
at
it
it
the
fault
of
your
very
lovely
and
feminine
idealism
but
you
seem
to
me
to
have
hardly
any
hold
on
the
fact
of
existence
to
be
unable
to
realise
it
if
i
could
only
give
you
the
sense
of
life
make
you
feel
the
movement
the
passion
the
drama
of
it
my
books
have
a
little
of
that
they
got
the
right
atmosphere
the
of
life
but
never
mind
my
books
i
do
want
you
to
have
another
literary
craze
i
beg
your
pardon
i
mean
phase
you
seem
to
have
had
an
artistic
one
lately
he
rose
to
go
i
always
cared
for
the
great
things
of
life
said
she
ah
yes
the
great
things
stamped
with
other
people
approval
i
want
you
to
love
life
itself
so
that
you
may
be
yourself
and
feel
yourself
being
her
whole
nature
responded
as
the
strings
of
the
violin
to
the
bow
of
the
master
life
was
one
of
those
words
which
specially
stirred
her
sensibility
as
wyndham
had
foreseen
it
was
a
word
to
conjure
with
and
now
as
he
had
willed
the
idea
of
it
possessed
her
she
repeated
mechanically
life
to
love
life
for
itself
and
first
you
must
know
life
in
order
to
love
it
she
sighed
slightly
as
if
she
had
taken
in
a
little
more
breath
to
say
the
ideal
was
flown
she
had
received
the
stamp
of
spirit
as
if
it
had
been
iron
upon
wax
it
was
her
way
of
being
herself
and
feeling
herself
being
the
same
evening
she
wrote
a
little
note
to
ted
that
ran
thus
dearest
ted
i
have
been
thinking
it
all
over
ever
since
yesterday
and
i
am
convinced
that
my
only
right
course
is
to
break
off
our
engagement
it
has
all
been
a
mistake
mine
and
yours
why
should
we
not
recognise
it
instead
of
each
persisting
in
making
the
other
miserable
i
release
you
from
your
promise
to
me
and
will
always
remain
very
affectionately
yours
audrey
craven
she
had
just
sent
the
note
to
the
post
when
a
servant
came
in
with
a
telegram
it
was
from
hardy
announcing
his
arrival
at
queenstown
and
she
had
trusted
to
her
engagement
to
ted
for
protection
against
vincent
claim
if
she
had
only
waited
chapter
xv
great
strength
and
safety
with
heaviest
charges
absolute
immunity
from
all
risk
of
blowing
open
the
combination
of
a
perfect
trigger
action
with
a
perfect
cocking
action
ted
haviland
was
standing
outside
the
window
of
a
gunsmith
shop
in
the
king
road
chelsea
reading
the
enticing
legends
in
which
webley
sets
forth
the
superiority
of
his
wares
above
those
of
all
other
makers
it
was
the
second
day
after
he
had
got
audrey
letter
in
his
least
hopeful
moods
he
had
never
expected
that
blow
and
when
it
fell
as
a
bolt
from
the
blue
he
was
stunned
and
could
not
realise
that
he
was
struck
he
imagined
all
kinds
of
explanations
to
account
for
audrey
conduct
it
was
a
misunderstanding
a
sudden
freak
there
was
some
mystery
waiting
to
be
solved
some
one
his
cousin
nettie
probably
had
spread
some
story
about
him
which
had
reached
audrey
the
scandal
already
spread
in
the
family
would
have
been
enough
she
could
hardly
have
identified
its
loudly
dressed
heroine
as
herself
it
only
remained
for
him
to
clear
his
character
anything
anything
rather
than
believe
in
what
all
healthy
youth
revolts
against
the
irrevocable
the
end
he
had
tried
three
times
to
see
audrey
and
she
was
not
at
home
though
the
third
time
he
had
seen
her
go
into
the
house
not
two
minutes
before
that
instant
he
had
turned
away
with
a
stinging
mist
in
his
eyes
and
the
blood
surging
in
his
brain
his
thoughts
now
leaped
to
the
end
as
blindly
as
they
had
shrunk
from
it
before
he
had
no
definite
idea
of
shooting
himself
when
he
turned
into
the
king
road
his
one
object
was
to
go
in
any
direction
rather
than
home
but
the
shop
window
with
its
stacks
of
rifles
and
cards
displaying
mark
i
revolvers
arranged
on
them
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
caught
his
attention
he
was
possessed
with
the
desire
to
have
a
revolver
of
his
own
no
matter
for
what
purpose
he
had
just
chosen
a
mark
and
was
going
into
the
shop
to
buy
it
when
he
heard
his
name
called
in
a
loud
hearty
voice
ted
you
bounder
stop
and
his
arm
was
pulled
with
a
grip
that
drew
him
backward
from
the
doorstep
hardy
he
knew
the
voice
but
it
was
hard
to
recognise
the
man
a
thick
black
beard
a
face
that
might
have
been
tanned
with
bark
trousers
tucked
into
high
boots
and
tightened
with
a
belt
like
a
an
old
norfolk
jacket
stained
with
travel
and
the
chase
a
canvas
shirt
laced
with
a
red
cord
and
tassels
and
a
hat
of
grey
felt
flapping
about
his
ears
made
hardy
look
something
like
a
cowboy
or
a
bandit
so
singular
was
the
apparition
that
had
plucked
ted
back
from
the
abyss
that
the
furies
and
the
infernal
phantoms
vanished
into
smoke
before
it
it
brought
with
it
a
breath
of
atlantic
seas
and
of
winds
from
the
far
west
you
young
rascal
so
it
you
is
it
i
did
know
you
from
satan
till
i
saw
you
turn
round
after
flattening
your
nose
against
i
wish
i
were
in
your
shoes
do
you
said
ted
with
a
grimace
h
why
because
your
whole
expression
suggests
partridges
does
it
as
it
happens
i
was
thinking
about
a
revolver
potting
burglars
eh
about
all
the
sport
you
poor
devils
of
cockneys
will
get
on
the
first
look
here
hardy
this
is
uncanny
where
did
you
spring
from
straight
from
euston
this
afternoon
from
queenstown
yesterday
morning
before
that
from
the
other
side
of
the
rockies
that
accounts
for
your
amazing
yes
and
by
jove
after
a
year
in
a
on
the
wrong
side
of
a
precipice
you
glad
to
get
your
feet
on
london
pavement
and
smell
london
smells
again
and
look
there
ted
there
is
a
lovelier
sight
on
god
earth
than
a
englishwoman
where
are
we
going
how
about
that
revolver
ted
had
forgotten
all
about
it
hardy
sane
spirits
had
infected
him
so
far
that
he
had
let
himself
be
dragged
at
a
rapid
pace
up
the
king
road
where
their
progress
attracted
considerable
attention
as
hardy
strode
on
with
his
long
swinging
legs
he
appeared
to
be
scattering
the
crowd
before
him
never
mind
the
thing
now
it
keep
how
that
girl
stares
does
she
take
us
for
banditti
not
you
you
puppy
in
that
coat
and
topper
no
mistaking
you
for
anything
but
what
you
are
the
sickly
product
of
an
effete
civilisation
do
be
frightened
you
have
gone
off
in
the
least
you
a
little
pale
but
prettier
than
you
were
if
anything
i
say
ought
to
be
in
the
bosom
of
your
family
i
have
got
a
family
well
what
brings
you
here
of
all
places
in
the
world
my
cousin
audrey
craven
there
was
no
reserve
about
hardy
at
the
name
so
unexpectedly
spoken
the
opened
again
for
ted
with
all
its
furies
they
walked
on
for
some
minutes
in
silence
then
hardy
began
again
i
called
to
see
her
of
course
she
was
out
hard
lines
was
it
ted
forced
himself
to
speak
oh
yes
beastly
hard
you
must
have
met
her
lately
how
is
she
looking
oh
remarkably
cheerful
when
i
last
saw
her
when
was
that
hardy
asked
a
little
anxiously
the
day
before
yesterday
ah
she
got
my
telegram
then
ted
bit
his
lip
they
were
too
much
absorbed
he
in
his
misery
and
hardy
in
his
joy
for
either
to
be
conscious
of
the
other
feeling
old
boy
said
hardy
as
they
turned
out
of
the
king
road
what
have
you
got
to
do
nothing
then
come
and
help
me
to
hunt
up
some
diggings
how
about
devon
street
i
do
know
but
i
suppose
we
can
look
said
ted
dismally
spirits
were
beginning
to
pall
on
him
i
may
as
well
go
and
look
up
katherine
while
i
about
it
dear
old
sis
i
suppose
she
be
out
too
not
she
she
too
busy
for
that
not
too
busy
to
see
her
old
playfellow
you
bet
your
boots
he
was
so
glad
to
see
everybody
again
that
he
was
sure
everybody
must
be
glad
to
see
him
in
his
rapture
at
being
in
london
the
place
he
loathed
and
execrated
a
year
ago
he
could
have
embraced
the
stranger
in
the
street
those
miles
of
pavement
those
towering
walls
that
seemed
to
make
streets
of
the
sky
as
he
looked
up
all
that
world
of
brick
and
mortar
was
audrey
world
the
ground
for
her
feet
the
scene
of
all
her
doings
the
women
that
went
by
wore
the
fashions
she
would
be
wearing
now
at
any
moment
she
herself
might
turn
out
of
some
round
some
corner
a
faint
hope
that
he
might
find
her
with
katherine
had
led
him
to
devon
street
but
ted
not
audrey
were
the
first
hands
that
touched
his
and
it
was
not
audrey
but
his
little
that
gave
hardy
his
first
welcome
home
well
sis
vincent
is
it
you
there
was
nothing
in
the
words
but
the
glad
courtesy
of
the
woman
who
had
been
his
playfellow
in
the
days
when
he
was
a
boy
and
she
a
tomboy
but
they
went
to
hardy
heart
and
dried
up
his
speech
they
were
the
first
kind
words
he
had
heard
since
he
left
england
katherine
put
away
her
work
and
made
him
sit
in
the
one
comfortable
chair
the
studio
afforded
rogers
was
sent
for
cakes
and
cream
at
a
moment
notice
and
the
resources
of
the
tiny
household
were
taxed
to
their
utmost
to
do
honour
to
the
returned
emigrant
even
ted
forgot
his
gloom
for
the
time
being
and
took
his
part
in
these
hospitable
rites
then
came
the
question
of
hardy
lodgings
rogers
was
consulted
and
being
unable
to
name
any
landlady
of
greater
respectability
than
herself
and
her
happening
to
be
to
let
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
for
her
she
suggested
that
the
gentleman
should
try
it
for
a
week
or
two
till
could
suit
elsewhere
but
though
i
sy
it
as
should
when
a
gentleman
comes
to
me
sir
wants
to
sty
my
larst
gentleman
a
styd
with
me
till
was
took
awy
in
coffin
if
i
a
kep
but
lor
bless
you
my
dear
was
that
i
could
do
with
fads
not
at
fancy
prices
i
could
i
to
tell
to
gow
for
mussy
syke
where
git
own
french
cook
and
own
butler
to
black
pyre
o
boots
all
at
once
for
this
was
the
recognised
fiction
by
which
rogers
accounted
for
the
departure
of
any
of
her
lodgers
lest
it
should
seem
to
speak
badly
for
her
willingness
and
for
the
quality
of
the
attendance
at
no
she
invariably
added
not
but
wot
i
work
my
orf
to
please
any
gentleman
that
a
gentleman
and
when
eaten
one
of
my
dinners
sir
you
wo
want
nobody
else
to
cook
and
do
for
you
no
more
and
though
ted
had
pointed
out
to
her
the
sinister
ambiguity
of
this
formula
she
had
never
invented
any
other
the
was
seen
and
after
rogers
on
her
part
had
stipulated
for
cold
lunches
three
days
in
the
week
and
not
more
than
one
bath
in
the
one
day
and
after
katherine
on
hardy
part
had
suggested
sundry
innovations
involving
the
condemnation
of
all
the
pictures
and
ornaments
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
a
piece
of
sacrilege
which
rogers
regarded
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
as
indicating
a
pitiable
aberration
of
intellect
the
rooms
were
taken
from
that
date
was
it
chance
or
necessity
or
providence
that
caused
ted
and
hardy
to
meet
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
that
waked
ted
from
the
dream
of
and
lodged
hardy
under
the
same
roof
with
katherine
haviland
his
arrangements
completed
hardy
hurried
off
again
to
chelsea
audrey
he
thought
had
expected
him
by
a
later
train
and
would
be
back
by
six
waiting
for
him
this
time
the
footman
met
him
with
a
little
note
from
his
mistress
audrey
had
never
dreamed
that
vincent
could
get
up
to
town
so
quickly
she
was
so
sorry
she
had
missed
him
especially
as
she
had
had
to
go
to
bed
with
a
feverish
cold
and
a
splitting
headache
she
would
be
delighted
to
see
him
if
he
could
call
afternoon
between
three
and
four
and
she
was
always
very
affectionately
his
he
was
bitterly
disappointed
but
his
disappointment
was
nothing
to
his
trouble
about
audrey
illness
feverish
colds
contracted
in
august
often
prove
fatal
but
he
was
not
utterly
cast
down
there
was
still
he
went
back
to
devon
street
slowly
for
he
felt
tired
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
muscular
exertions
that
day
during
the
evening
which
he
spent
in
the
havilands
studio
his
depression
gave
way
before
the
prospect
of
seeing
audrey
he
looked
at
katherine
pictures
gave
her
a
great
deal
of
advice
and
expressed
the
utmost
astonishment
at
the
progress
she
had
made
he
considered
the
witch
of
atlas
particularly
fine
it
was
painted
four
years
ago
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
made
a
bit
of
progress
since
but
never
mind
you
quite
right
it
is
half
bad
she
bent
over
her
picture
lovingly
brushed
away
the
dust
from
the
canvas
and
turned
it
resolutely
with
its
face
to
the
wall
she
had
not
looked
at
it
since
the
day
of
renunciation
her
work
led
hardy
on
to
talk
of
his
and
he
grew
eloquent
about
the
book
sport
west
of
the
rockies
which
as
he
had
once
told
audrey
was
to
make
posterity
sit
up
he
had
the
manuscript
downstairs
in
his
bag
some
day
he
would
read
them
a
chapter
or
two
it
would
give
them
some
idea
of
wild
virgin
nature
of
what
a
sportsman
life
really
was
the
best
life
perhaps
take
it
all
round
to
be
lived
on
this
earth
it
was
to
be
the
of
its
subject
hardy
was
always
at
his
ease
with
ted
and
katherine
was
superfluous
in
their
company
they
knew
him
too
well
and
liked
him
in
spite
of
their
knowledge
they
were
used
to
his
tempestuous
bursts
of
narrative
and
would
laugh
frankly
in
his
face
while
he
joined
in
the
laugh
with
the
greatest
enjoyment
with
him
ornamental
was
an
amusing
game
in
which
if
you
were
clever
enough
to
catch
him
lying
you
had
won
and
he
had
lost
that
was
all
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
expanded
gloriously
he
told
tales
of
perilous
adventure
by
flood
and
field
by
mountain
and
forest
of
the
wild
chase
of
moose
and
wapiti
among
the
snows
of
the
rockies
of
the
fierce
delight
of
combat
with
grizzly
bears
the
deadliest
of
their
kind
of
how
he
hardy
had
been
rolled
down
a
cañon
locked
in
the
embrace
of
a
furry
fiend
that
he
had
stabbed
in
the
throat
one
second
before
the
fatal
hug
he
told
of
the
melting
of
the
snows
in
forest
rivers
of
the
flood
that
swept
away
the
lonely
encampment
and
bore
him
astride
on
a
log
of
driftwood
five
miles
amid
wrack
and
boulders
on
its
whirling
current
of
deliverance
through
a
pious
indian
and
his
canoe
which
he
entered
as
by
a
miracle
in
and
without
upsetting
any
of
the
three
he
told
of
long
wanderings
in
the
twilight
solitudes
of
canadian
forests
of
dangers
from
wolves
and
the
wild
coyotes
heard
nightly
howling
round
the
indian
and
from
the
intangible
malice
of
the
skunk
a
beautiful
but
dreadful
power
to
be
propitiated
with
bated
breath
and
muffled
footstep
he
told
too
of
the
with
their
sharp
twittering
bark
and
he
contrived
to
invest
even
these
tiny
creatures
with
an
atmosphere
of
terror
for
it
is
well
known
that
their
temper
is
atrocious
and
that
a
colony
of
them
will
set
upon
the
unfortunate
traveller
who
happens
to
offend
one
and
leave
nothing
of
him
but
his
bones
and
the
indigestible
portions
of
his
clothing
and
over
all
he
cast
the
glamour
of
his
fancy
as
if
it
had
been
the
red
light
of
the
prairie
sunsets
in
it
he
appeared
transfigured
a
personage
heroic
if
not
indeed
divine
the
whole
of
it
had
appeared
word
for
word
in
the
pages
of
the
ah
sis
he
observed
complacently
at
the
end
of
it
that
all
copy
for
west
of
the
rockies
when
that
comes
out
you
soon
see
me
at
the
top
of
the
tree
why
are
you
an
artist
in
words
why
do
you
use
the
pen
instead
of
the
brush
he
implied
that
if
her
ambition
had
been
literary
he
would
have
raised
her
to
a
position
just
below
him
on
the
highest
pinnacle
of
earthly
fame
then
he
passed
by
a
gentle
transition
to
another
subject
have
you
two
seen
much
of
my
cousin
audrey
this
second
utterance
of
the
name
was
too
much
for
ted
overstrained
nerves
he
got
up
stifled
a
yawn
and
held
out
his
hand
to
hardy
i
say
do
you
mind
if
i
go
to
bed
now
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
keep
awake
old
fellow
i
afraid
i
sent
you
to
sleep
with
my
yarns
not
a
bit
we
have
some
more
what
the
matter
with
the
boy
kathy
he
looks
seedy
oh
nothing
he
not
perhaps
but
he
all
right
what
he
doing
with
himself
here
painting
oh
vincent
i
should
like
you
to
see
some
of
his
things
now
he
gone
all
her
pride
in
her
brother
was
roused
perhaps
by
vincent
boasting
she
lifted
the
white
linen
cloth
that
covered
one
of
ted
easels
and
revealed
the
portrait
of
audrey
she
had
not
guessed
the
truth
if
she
had
she
would
not
have
looked
at
vincent
just
then
the
effect
she
had
produced
was
unmistakable
the
blood
rose
to
his
face
in
a
wave
that
died
suddenly
away
leaving
a
yellowish
pallor
under
its
sunburn
how
beautiful
he
said
softly
more
to
himself
than
katherine
he
gazed
at
the
portrait
as
if
his
eyes
would
never
be
satisfied
with
seeing
the
pathos
in
his
face
gave
it
a
sort
of
spirituality
and
katherine
noticed
his
hand
trembling
as
he
helped
her
to
cover
the
picture
again
it
like
her
as
only
genius
could
make
it
only
genius
did
he
think
that
only
genius
had
wrought
that
work
of
transfiguration
in
which
katherine
found
it
hard
to
see
any
likeness
to
the
woman
as
she
knew
her
now
she
had
read
the
secret
of
hope
ought
she
to
let
him
believe
a
lie
did
not
she
ted
sister
of
all
people
owe
him
the
truth
no
vincent
eyes
looked
as
if
they
wanted
sleep
before
everything
sufficient
unto
the
night
is
the
evil
thereof
and
perhaps
after
all
she
had
been
mistaken
hardy
held
out
his
hand
said
a
short
and
was
gone
before
she
could
say
more
there
flashed
back
on
her
the
memory
of
audrey
first
visit
to
her
she
recalled
her
little
air
of
possession
in
speaking
of
her
cousin
she
was
morally
certain
that
audrey
had
treated
vincent
as
she
had
treated
ted
beware
of
the
woman
who
kisses
you
on
both
cheeks
it
too
much
for
friendship
and
too
little
for
love
hardy
went
out
of
doors
turned
on
to
the
embankment
and
so
on
to
chelsea
for
the
third
time
that
day
he
wanted
to
assure
himself
of
audrey
nearness
by
one
more
sight
of
the
brown
brick
shrine
that
held
her
the
house
stood
as
he
had
seen
it
once
before
asleep
in
the
yellow
gaslight
shut
in
from
the
road
by
the
trees
screened
from
the
lamps
on
the
embankment
by
the
folded
over
its
windows
guarding
its
secrets
well
all
but
two
windows
on
the
second
floor
which
were
open
to
the
night
that
was
audrey
room
he
knew
little
fool
ill
with
a
feverish
cold
and
sleeping
with
open
windows
for
about
half
an
hour
he
walked
up
and
down
on
the
embankment
opposite
like
a
sentry
on
duty
his
long
shadow
blackening
and
fading
as
he
passed
from
light
to
light
when
he
got
back
to
his
rooms
he
felt
a
sensation
that
had
sometimes
come
upon
him
after
a
long
day
hunting
a
feeling
of
deadly
fatigue
and
stifling
emptiness
as
if
the
rest
of
his
body
were
drained
of
the
blood
that
choked
his
heart
he
opened
his
took
out
a
large
silver
flask
looked
at
it
sighed
shuddered
slightly
poured
about
two
tablespoonfuls
of
brandy
down
his
throat
and
then
with
a
gesture
of
indescribable
disgust
emptied
the
remainder
out
of
the
window
into
the
yard
below
he
undressed
and
got
into
bed
quickly
turned
over
on
his
right
side
for
greater
ease
and
was
soon
asleep
and
dreaming
of
chapter
xvi
there
was
no
sleep
for
ted
that
night
towards
morning
he
fell
into
a
doze
broken
by
unpleasant
dreams
and
woke
with
a
confused
consciousness
of
trouble
it
had
been
connected
in
his
dreams
with
hardy
return
and
once
awake
the
knowledge
that
he
was
in
the
same
house
with
him
was
insupportable
not
that
he
had
yet
guessed
how
vincent
stood
to
audrey
he
had
simply
a
nervous
dread
of
hearing
him
talk
about
her
the
casual
utterance
of
her
name
went
through
him
like
a
sword
and
in
his
present
mood
vincent
boisterous
spirit
disturbed
and
irritated
him
more
to
get
away
from
him
than
with
any
definite
idea
of
work
he
spent
his
morning
at
the
national
gallery
touching
up
the
copy
of
the
botticelli
madonna
which
katherine
had
begun
long
ago
for
audrey
he
had
set
to
work
almost
mechanically
with
a
sense
that
whatever
he
did
at
the
present
moment
was
only
provisional
only
a
staving
off
of
the
intolerable
future
but
soon
the
technical
difficulties
of
his
task
absorbed
him
and
he
became
interested
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
so
passive
to
the
spiritual
influences
of
line
and
colour
that
perhaps
the
beauty
of
the
girl
madonna
may
have
given
him
something
of
its
own
tranquillity
unfortunately
the
good
effects
of
his
morning
industry
were
undone
when
he
got
home
by
finding
hardy
alone
in
the
studio
sitting
before
audrey
portrait
he
had
dragged
the
easel
to
the
light
and
had
been
studying
the
canvas
for
some
minutes
before
ted
came
in
the
boy
stifled
an
angry
exclamation
ted
said
hardy
what
do
you
want
for
this
picture
i
do
want
anything
for
it
nonsense
every
good
picture
has
its
price
this
one
has
anyway
look
here
and
do
be
a
young
fool
this
is
the
best
thing
done
in
your
life
or
ever
will
do
i
in
rather
low
water
at
present
but
wait
till
i
heard
from
my
british
columbian
agent
or
better
still
wait
till
the
comes
out
and
i
give
you
a
hundred
for
it
honour
bright
if
you
let
me
have
it
at
once
i
ca
let
you
have
it
at
once
and
i
wo
let
you
have
it
at
all
the
deuce
you
wo
come
fix
your
own
price
i
not
a
swindling
dealer
and
i
not
a
liar
though
you
think
it
i
told
you
i
was
going
to
let
you
have
it
at
any
price
h
do
you
mind
telling
me
one
thing
are
you
going
to
sell
it
to
any
one
else
i
not
going
to
sell
it
to
any
one
i
going
to
keep
it
myself
they
looked
at
each
other
with
steady
eyes
each
understanding
and
each
defying
the
other
thought
hardy
face
was
the
first
to
soften
he
put
his
hand
on
ted
shoulders
all
right
old
boy
we
hit
each
other
hard
this
time
the
least
we
can
do
is
to
hold
our
tongues
about
it
and
he
left
him
hardy
spoke
with
the
magnanimity
of
imperfect
comprehension
he
had
been
defeated
in
his
purpose
of
buying
audrey
portrait
but
however
great
his
discomfiture
he
being
the
successful
lover
could
afford
a
little
pity
for
ted
as
the
victim
of
a
hopeless
passion
to
ted
on
the
other
hand
the
revelation
of
hardy
feelings
threw
light
on
conduct
it
accounted
for
everything
that
was
most
inexplicable
in
it
it
must
have
been
the
news
of
hardy
return
that
made
her
break
off
her
engagement
so
suddenly
his
instinct
told
him
that
she
had
probably
given
her
word
to
her
cousin
before
he
left
england
jealousy
suggested
that
she
had
cared
for
him
all
the
time
he
tried
to
reason
it
out
but
stopped
short
of
the
obvious
conclusion
that
if
these
things
were
altogether
as
he
supposed
her
engagement
to
himself
must
have
been
merely
an
amusement
hit
upon
by
audrey
to
fill
up
a
dull
interval
he
preferred
to
regard
it
as
a
mystery
and
now
all
reasoning
gave
way
before
the
desire
to
see
her
again
and
know
the
truth
from
herself
once
for
all
to
audrey
as
the
fountain
of
truth
he
accordingly
went
choosing
a
time
between
two
and
three
when
she
was
most
likely
to
be
in
as
he
reached
her
door
it
was
being
held
open
for
her
to
go
out
and
she
was
standing
in
the
outer
hall
buttoning
her
gloves
she
drew
back
when
she
saw
ted
but
escape
was
impossible
he
saw
the
movement
and
the
flash
of
her
little
white
teeth
as
she
bit
her
lip
with
annoyance
she
came
forward
smiling
oh
is
it
you
ted
as
you
see
i
just
going
out
you
will
see
me
before
you
go
i
ca
possibly
i
got
to
go
and
call
on
an
uncle
and
aunt
at
the
hôtel
metropole
i
very
sorry
but
i
wo
keep
you
more
than
ten
minutes
i
ca
spare
ten
minutes
i
late
as
it
is
and
i
have
to
be
back
by
three
i
got
an
appointment
you
not
time
to
get
there
and
back
you
better
put
it
off
i
ca
ted
they
only
up
from
friday
till
monday
dean
craven
has
to
preach
at
the
abbey
come
again
i
ca
come
again
well
then
she
hesitated
you
may
walk
part
of
the
way
with
me
he
went
with
her
down
the
short
flagged
path
that
led
to
the
gate
once
out
of
the
servant
hearing
he
stopped
and
looked
firmly
in
her
face
i
must
see
you
now
and
it
had
better
be
in
the
house
i
only
one
question
to
ask
you
five
minutes
will
be
enough
for
that
at
least
it
wo
be
my
fault
if
it
is
she
had
laid
her
hand
on
the
gate
which
ted
held
shut
and
her
mouth
was
obstinately
set
something
in
his
voice
conquered
her
she
turned
and
led
the
way
to
the
house
you
had
better
come
into
the
he
followed
her
she
closed
the
door
and
they
stood
facing
each
other
a
moment
without
speaking
well
ted
her
voice
went
to
his
heart
with
its
piercing
sweetness
audrey
why
did
you
write
that
letter
because
it
was
easier
to
write
what
i
did
than
to
say
it
do
you
want
to
hold
me
to
my
word
no
i
want
to
know
your
reasons
for
breaking
it
you
have
given
me
any
yet
i
did
ted
i
told
you
it
had
all
been
a
mistake
yours
and
mine
speak
for
yourself
where
was
my
mistake
the
mistake
was
in
our
ever
getting
engaged
at
all
in
our
thinking
that
we
cared
for
each
other
i
cared
enough
for
you
did
i
no
you
did
you
only
thought
you
did
katherine
told
me
what
did
katherine
tell
you
that
you
had
any
feelings
that
you
really
cared
for
nothing
but
your
painting
that
you
only
a
ru
rudimentary
heart
really
that
is
interesting
when
did
she
tell
you
that
the
very
day
we
were
engaged
and
you
believed
her
not
then
i
did
afterwards
how
long
afterwards
the
other
day
i
think
so
i
see
when
you
wanted
to
believe
it
not
before
she
was
trembling
but
she
gathered
together
all
her
feeble
forces
for
the
defence
no
no
do
you
remember
at
the
very
first
the
day
of
our
engagement
we
were
both
so
miserable
at
the
idea
of
your
going
away
we
did
it
all
so
recklessly
before
either
of
us
thought
you
see
ted
you
were
so
very
young
it
a
pity
that
did
strike
you
before
it
did
it
did
but
i
would
think
of
it
i
blinded
myself
the
fact
is
we
were
both
as
mad
as
hatters
you
know
people
ca
get
married
in
that
state
we
should
have
had
to
wait
for
a
a
lucid
interval
ted
recognised
the
miserable
pleasantry
it
was
what
he
had
said
to
her
himself
a
day
or
two
after
their
engagement
the
phrase
had
amused
audrey
at
the
time
and
lodged
in
her
memory
she
borrowed
it
now
in
her
hour
of
need
and
laughed
unconscious
of
her
plagiarism
i
understand
perfectly
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
as
a
proof
of
your
own
sanity
is
that
it
she
looked
up
in
the
utmost
surprise
not
to
get
rid
of
you
ted
of
course
not
i
shall
still
keep
you
as
my
best
friend
thanks
you
had
better
not
try
to
do
that
i
told
i
no
talent
for
friendship
then
i
suppose
after
this
you
rather
i
cut
you
if
we
meet
you
can
please
yourself
about
that
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
oh
ted
i
did
expect
that
from
you
but
it
quite
right
hit
hard
i
ca
defend
myself
please
do
attempt
it
there
no
occasion
to
only
tell
me
one
thing
well
she
sat
down
as
if
wearied
with
this
unnecessary
trifling
he
paused
it
evident
that
you
do
care
about
do
you
care
for
any
one
else
you
no
right
to
ask
me
that
have
i
i
thought
i
had
and
if
you
only
think
a
minute
agree
with
me
she
put
her
head
on
one
side
as
if
gravely
considering
the
question
no
you
no
right
to
ask
me
that
let
me
put
it
differently
since
your
feelings
are
sacred
you
tell
me
anything
about
were
you
engaged
to
hardy
before
you
knew
me
that
question
is
even
more
impertinent
than
the
last
i
beg
your
pardon
then
do
answer
it
if
you
do
like
to
he
turned
away
do
go
yet
ted
i
have
done
listen
i
was
thoughtless
i
was
mistaken
audrey
was
anxious
to
escape
the
imputation
of
a
big
fault
by
the
graceful
confession
of
a
little
one
but
i
not
as
bad
as
you
think
me
you
think
i
cared
for
vincent
i
did
i
never
cared
a
straw
about
him
never
you
were
the
first
was
i
not
the
last
though
it
seems
perhaps
not
but
i
deceived
myself
before
i
deceived
you
well
you
took
me
in
completely
if
it
any
satisfaction
to
you
never
mind
audrey
you
done
your
best
to
remedy
that
now
he
had
turned
and
his
hand
was
on
the
door
to
go
when
he
heard
her
calling
him
back
softly
ted
she
had
followed
him
to
the
door
he
felt
the
touch
of
her
little
gloved
hand
on
his
under
the
black
meshes
of
her
veil
he
saw
her
eyes
shining
with
tears
that
could
not
fall
he
hesitated
forgive
me
she
whispered
not
till
you
have
answered
my
question
which
question
ted
the
impertinent
one
about
vincent
yes
her
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
the
ground
now
they
glanced
up
quickly
did
vincent
tell
you
i
was
engaged
to
him
no
her
eyelids
drooped
again
then
urged
to
desperation
by
her
own
cowardice
she
raised
them
and
looked
in
his
face
to
answer
and
as
she
looked
she
saw
for
the
first
time
how
changed
it
was
its
bloom
was
gone
the
lines
were
set
and
hard
ted
looked
years
older
than
his
age
do
believe
him
if
he
ever
says
so
i
am
not
engaged
to
him
and
i
never
was
thanks
that
was
all
i
wanted
to
know
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
her
he
knew
that
she
had
lied
he
left
her
in
a
state
of
vague
consternation
she
had
been
prepared
for
an
outburst
of
feeling
on
ted
part
in
which
case
she
would
have
remained
mistress
of
the
field
without
loss
of
dignity
as
it
had
happened
the
victory
was
certainly
not
with
her
this
was
contrary
to
all
her
expectations
she
had
looked
for
protestations
emotions
in
short
a
scene
but
not
for
cold
dispassionate
it
was
so
unlike
ted
ted
who
was
always
giving
himself
away
it
was
more
the
sort
of
thing
she
could
have
fancied
wyndham
saying
under
the
same
circumstances
she
had
seen
something
of
this
impersonal
manner
once
or
twice
before
in
those
rare
moments
when
they
had
discussed
some
picture
or
ted
had
talked
to
her
about
his
work
or
katherine
it
had
annoyed
her
then
she
thought
it
showed
a
want
of
enthusiasm
now
the
boy
heartless
amazed
and
overpowered
her
audrey
was
incapable
of
imagining
what
she
had
not
seen
and
she
had
never
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
haviland
character
never
divined
its
gravity
under
the
mask
of
frivolity
never
proved
its
will
nor
reckoned
with
its
pride
three
days
ago
she
would
have
laughed
at
the
idea
of
referring
any
moral
question
to
ted
judgment
for
she
had
taken
no
pains
to
hide
her
faults
from
him
she
had
been
selfish
reckless
vain
capricious
by
turns
and
altogether
and
it
had
made
no
difference
then
now
she
felt
that
he
had
condemned
her
to
be
sure
she
had
told
him
a
lie
but
what
was
that
in
the
catalogue
of
her
offences
it
was
everything
he
could
have
forgiven
anything
but
that
chapter
xvii
but
ted
notion
of
morality
was
a
question
audrey
had
no
time
to
go
into
a
violent
ring
at
the
bell
recalled
her
to
herself
and
made
her
glance
at
the
clock
it
was
a
three
she
had
wasted
half
an
hour
in
fruitless
discussion
with
ted
and
it
left
her
for
the
stormy
interview
to
follow
her
nerve
gave
way
before
the
prospect
of
that
hour
with
hardy
she
might
have
escaped
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
ted
for
she
had
meant
to
call
early
on
her
uncle
and
aunt
and
bring
them
back
with
her
to
chelsea
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
vincent
to
see
her
alone
ted
coming
had
made
that
scheme
useless
she
listened
yes
it
was
vincent
she
had
heard
his
voice
in
the
hall
i
told
him
between
three
and
four
anybody
else
would
have
known
that
meant
four
she
spent
ten
minutes
after
hardy
was
announced
gathering
herself
together
to
meet
him
she
would
have
thought
of
sending
for
miss
craven
an
old
device
of
hers
when
she
wanted
to
avoid
explanations
but
miss
craven
was
away
her
only
hope
was
in
some
casual
caller
meanwhile
hardy
was
striding
up
and
down
the
waiting
impatiently
for
audrey
he
was
a
little
hurt
at
being
shown
into
an
empty
room
he
had
expected
to
find
the
small
thing
sitting
there
to
welcome
him
that
ten
minutes
was
the
longest
he
had
ever
spent
it
was
the
in
time
for
two
eternities
as
his
thought
leaped
forward
to
the
future
it
was
thrown
back
upon
the
past
then
as
he
gazed
about
him
half
mechanically
he
was
aware
that
his
eyes
were
looking
for
the
things
they
had
been
used
to
and
could
not
find
them
everything
was
changed
in
that
room
he
had
run
in
and
out
of
as
a
boy
the
familiar
furniture
the
signs
and
tokens
of
audrey
daily
presence
the
which
had
delighted
her
mother
heart
all
were
gone
his
aunt
portrait
was
no
longer
there
in
its
place
hung
the
photogravure
of
the
madonna
di
san
sisto
instead
of
the
cosy
corner
where
he
had
lain
at
audrey
feet
his
last
night
in
england
there
stood
a
polished
rosewood
secretary
thrown
open
showing
its
empty
everywhere
he
looked
it
was
the
same
there
were
new
things
all
around
him
if
he
could
have
read
their
secret
he
would
have
seen
that
that
room
was
the
picture
of
audrey
soul
the
persons
who
had
by
turns
taken
possession
of
it
had
left
there
each
one
the
traces
of
his
power
if
you
could
have
cut
a
vertical
section
through
soul
you
would
have
found
it
built
up
in
successive
layers
of
soul
when
you
had
dug
through
wyndham
you
came
to
ted
when
you
had
got
through
ted
you
came
upon
hardy
the
oldest
formation
of
all
the
room
was
instructive
as
a
museum
filled
with
the
records
of
these
changes
but
the
specimens
were
badly
arranged
recent
deposits
lying
side
by
side
with
relics
of
an
earlier
period
thus
the
floor
was
covered
with
the
bearskin
given
by
hardy
and
the
persian
rugs
laid
down
during
the
art
age
the
rosewood
secretary
and
a
little
revolving
by
audrey
chair
marked
the
change
wrought
by
wyndham
they
were
part
of
modern
history
and
the
memory
of
man
hardy
in
the
midst
of
these
curiosities
of
natural
science
was
like
a
lay
visitor
without
a
guide
he
admired
he
wondered
he
recognised
an
object
here
and
there
but
of
what
it
all
meant
he
had
not
the
ghost
of
an
idea
he
left
off
wondering
and
waited
listening
for
the
feet
that
used
to
fall
so
lightly
on
the
stairs
at
last
the
door
opened
softly
and
audrey
stood
before
him
but
she
stood
still
looking
at
him
as
if
uncertain
whether
to
go
or
stay
audrey
his
face
lit
up
with
joy
his
heart
bounded
how
do
you
do
vincent
he
held
out
his
arms
and
she
came
to
him
slowly
without
a
word
she
let
him
hold
her
for
an
instant
closing
her
eyes
to
hide
the
fear
in
them
let
him
lift
her
veil
and
kiss
her
cheeks
and
mouth
then
she
turned
her
face
away
put
out
her
hands
against
his
chest
and
pushed
him
from
her
audrey
what
have
i
done
oh
i
do
know
i
do
know
she
walked
away
to
the
over
the
chimneypiece
and
took
off
her
gloves
and
veil
she
wanted
to
gain
time
hardy
followed
her
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
fireplace
whatever
possessed
you
vincent
to
grow
that
horrid
beard
he
had
forgotten
the
change
in
his
personal
appearance
he
looked
in
the
glass
and
was
startled
by
his
own
reflection
owing
to
the
agony
of
the
shock
she
had
given
him
his
face
was
still
grey
and
drawn
the
poor
fellow
tried
to
smile
and
that
made
matters
worse
i
daresay
it
was
a
nasty
shock
did
it
make
you
feel
as
if
i
was
somebody
else
oh
no
it
has
not
altered
you
much
it
not
that
but
i
hate
beards
as
you
know
there
was
silence
hardy
was
struggling
with
the
old
stifling
sensation
in
his
heart
emotion
was
bad
for
him
is
this
all
you
got
to
say
to
me
after
being
a
year
away
she
looked
at
him
shook
her
head
and
played
with
the
ornaments
on
the
why
ca
you
speak
to
me
has
anything
happened
is
anybody
dead
no
but
i
wish
i
was
why
do
you
say
that
because
she
was
trying
to
wring
the
neck
off
a
little
china
image
now
oh
vincent
do
think
me
very
unkind
but
i
i
rather
another
time
you
did
show
your
cousinly
affection
quite
in
that
way
that
all
he
covered
his
eyes
with
one
hand
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
audrey
no
that
not
all
i
see
there
something
else
behind
that
there
must
be
anything
happened
she
bowed
her
head
and
sighed
a
long
shivering
sigh
the
china
image
slipped
through
her
fingers
and
was
broken
to
bits
on
the
hearthstone
audrey
what
is
it
he
took
her
by
the
wrists
and
drew
her
gently
to
him
as
he
touched
her
he
saw
her
face
whiten
and
her
eyes
dilate
do
you
remember
last
year
when
you
said
you
loved
me
when
you
promised
to
be
my
wife
do
you
remember
how
you
said
to
me
then
now
you
wo
speak
to
me
what
have
you
been
doing
to
make
you
hate
me
or
what
stupid
idea
have
you
got
into
your
head
about
me
nothing
nothing
only
i
want
you
to
understand
that
what
you
said
just
now
is
out
of
the
question
it
ca
be
why
not
you
promised
so
it
could
be
once
why
not
now
because
because
i
never
really
promised
you
know
you
never
promised
you
little
liar
you
may
want
to
break
your
promise
but
you
can
hardly
say
you
did
make
it
i
never
made
it
not
of
my
own
free
will
you
took
advantage
of
me
you
forced
me
into
it
you
teased
me
till
i
said
i
cared
for
you
and
i
did
so
then
you
told
me
a
lie
you
wrote
lie
after
lie
to
me
in
your
letters
for
a
year
she
writhed
away
from
him
but
he
still
held
her
by
the
wrists
face
to
face
with
him
the
length
of
their
arms
apart
let
me
go
vincent
you
no
right
to
hold
me
in
this
way
hurting
my
arm
unconsciously
his
grasp
had
tightened
till
the
diamond
mounted
on
one
of
her
bracelets
was
pressed
into
her
flesh
and
made
it
bleed
see
there
he
let
her
go
she
sat
down
and
put
her
to
her
wrist
if
you
tell
lies
audrey
what
am
i
to
believe
what
you
said
then
or
what
you
say
now
i
telling
the
truth
now
because
i
do
want
this
wretched
misunderstanding
to
go
any
further
ca
you
speak
plainly
do
you
mean
this
that
you
do
love
me
yes
it
true
i
do
love
you
i
ca
at
least
not
like
that
i
ca
believe
it
it
impossible
as
long
as
i
can
remember
whatever
you
said
or
did
you
made
me
think
you
loved
me
you
said
last
year
you
be
my
wife
but
that
nothing
long
before
that
you
let
me
live
on
the
hope
of
it
year
after
year
it
inconceivable
that
you
could
have
done
these
things
if
you
did
care
for
me
even
you
could
be
such
an
unfeeling
little
fiend
no
no
you
worked
on
my
feelings
you
would
let
me
have
any
will
of
my
own
and
now
you
want
me
to
marry
you
whether
i
like
it
or
not
whatever
happens
i
ca
do
that
vincent
why
not
must
i
tell
you
is
that
the
very
least
you
can
do
well
you
know
vincent
you
been
very
wild
you
told
me
so
yourself
a
thousand
times
is
it
that
you
knew
that
long
ago
i
never
realised
it
till
now
now
i
know
that
i
can
only
really
love
some
one
strong
and
good
whose
goodness
would
help
me
and
make
me
good
too
audrey
infantile
irony
made
hardy
laugh
that
laugh
frightened
her
do
you
think
i
do
know
that
he
said
what
do
you
suppose
i
went
out
of
england
for
it
was
to
shoot
or
to
farm
either
it
was
to
get
away
out
of
the
reach
of
temptation
to
live
in
a
pure
air
and
make
myself
pure
for
your
sake
do
you
know
audrey
i
was
out
there
without
a
soul
to
speak
to
a
year
one
horrible
long
year
fighting
the
devil
waiting
till
i
could
come
back
and
tell
you
that
i
was
fit
to
love
you
god
knows
i
not
all
i
ought
to
be
who
is
at
least
i
not
ashamed
now
to
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
will
you
never
forget
the
past
she
had
hesitated
before
but
now
hardy
humility
put
her
in
the
position
of
the
superior
and
his
piteous
confession
gave
her
the
words
she
wanted
no
it
no
use
once
for
all
i
do
not
love
you
and
if
i
did
i
could
not
marry
any
man
who
had
led
the
life
you
have
very
well
remember
audrey
if
i
was
good
enough
for
you
i
was
good
enough
as
men
go
now
i
go
to
the
devil
and
give
my
whole
mind
to
it
but
i
a
great
deal
to
say
to
you
before
i
go
you
object
to
my
life
good
or
bad
it
your
own
work
it
women
like
you
who
make
men
like
me
you
knew
my
weakness
and
played
on
it
you
could
have
helped
me
if
you
only
given
me
up
honestly
at
first
as
another
woman
would
have
done
but
you
did
want
to
do
that
i
have
left
england
long
before
if
you
let
me
go
you
knew
it
and
you
kept
me
here
though
you
saw
me
going
to
the
bad
oh
you
were
an
artist
in
your
own
line
you
knew
the
effect
of
every
word
every
touch
every
movement
of
yours
and
you
went
out
of
your
way
to
to
make
goodness
impossible
for
me
god
knows
why
but
you
liked
you
to
see
me
longing
for
what
you
never
meant
to
give
me
and
because
i
did
come
out
of
that
ordeal
quite
clean
you
talk
to
me
about
my
life
and
tell
me
you
are
too
good
and
pure
to
marry
me
are
you
really
so
very
much
better
than
i
am
after
all
she
sat
still
at
first
with
her
eyes
half
closed
afraid
to
look
up
afraid
to
move
or
speak
waiting
for
something
to
happen
for
some
one
to
come
and
stop
vincent
but
the
scourging
voice
went
on
with
a
relentless
brutality
laying
bare
the
secret
places
of
her
soul
its
unconscious
hypocrisy
its
vanity
its
latent
capacity
for
evil
she
answered
the
closing
question
with
an
inarticulate
sound
like
a
sob
it
might
have
softened
him
if
he
had
not
been
deaf
to
everything
but
his
own
passion
do
suppose
i
flatter
myself
i
the
only
victim
how
about
that
young
fool
ted
haviland
she
sprang
to
her
feet
fear
that
had
made
her
lie
to
ted
made
her
tell
the
truth
to
hardy
that
fear
was
it
dated
from
the
days
when
they
were
children
and
vincent
had
the
mastery
in
all
their
play
oh
vincent
promise
me
promise
me
you
wo
do
anything
to
ted
all
true
about
our
engagement
but
it
was
more
my
fault
than
his
i
ca
believe
that
audrey
i
very
far
from
blaming
him
i
no
doubt
you
treated
him
as
you
did
me
he
sat
down
exhausted
audrey
seeing
the
change
of
position
not
the
sudden
collapse
that
prompted
it
was
in
despair
wo
you
leave
me
alone
now
vincent
have
you
said
enough
not
yet
let
me
think
a
bit
he
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes
he
had
so
much
to
say
and
now
he
had
no
words
to
say
it
with
audrey
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
four
would
he
begin
again
she
almost
wished
he
would
it
would
be
better
than
this
silence
better
than
that
frowning
forehead
with
the
terrible
accusing
thoughts
behind
it
would
no
one
come
would
he
never
go
hardy
had
found
words
and
was
beginning
to
rouse
himself
when
in
answer
to
her
prayer
the
door
was
thrown
open
her
deliverance
had
come
in
the
shape
of
langley
wyndham
hardy
eyes
followed
her
a
moment
before
she
had
sat
white
and
trembling
shrunk
up
into
herself
before
the
storm
of
his
accusation
now
for
that
instant
her
face
became
beautiful
as
he
had
never
seen
it
before
there
was
something
dramatic
in
her
movement
as
she
rose
and
went
forward
to
meet
wyndham
there
was
no
mistaking
her
manner
and
the
tremor
of
her
voice
as
she
spoke
to
him
hardy
knew
his
rival
before
he
saw
him
my
cousin
hardy
langley
wyndham
the
men
looked
at
each
other
and
bowed
stiffly
wyndham
wondered
the
scene
they
had
just
gone
through
had
left
its
mark
on
hardy
face
and
audrey
the
student
of
human
nature
congratulated
himself
on
the
inspiration
which
had
prompted
him
to
call
at
this
crisis
the
cousin
suggested
interesting
complications
in
his
heroine
life
judging
by
the
set
of
his
lower
jaw
she
must
have
had
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
with
him
he
would
have
to
reconstruct
that
drama
from
the
fragments
preserved
when
wyndham
sat
down
hardy
sat
down
too
he
suspected
audrey
of
having
invited
this
man
in
order
to
get
rid
of
himself
she
wanted
him
to
go
a
savage
jealousy
made
him
determined
to
stay
and
spoil
her
pleasure
but
audrey
with
wyndham
beside
her
had
recovered
her
presence
of
mind
unable
to
endure
the
situation
longer
she
was
about
to
risk
a
bold
stroke
by
which
she
would
at
once
revenge
herself
on
vincent
escape
from
the
torture
of
his
society
and
assure
herself
of
friendship
after
the
preliminary
commonplaces
she
watched
her
opportunity
till
she
could
arrest
wyndham
eyes
with
hers
throwing
into
their
expression
all
that
she
knew
of
pathos
and
appeal
then
she
rose
and
held
out
her
hand
to
hardy
saying
with
distinct
deliberation
i
afraid
you
must
excuse
me
now
vincent
i
have
to
take
wyndham
to
call
on
my
uncle
dean
craven
the
look
that
she
turned
on
wyndham
said
plainly
you
see
desperate
if
you
have
enough
chivalry
to
back
that
up
i
done
for
happily
for
her
this
time
wyndham
chivalry
was
equal
to
his
intelligence
he
answered
in
the
most
natural
manner
possible
if
miss
craven
is
ready
i
am
as
i
rather
late
i
think
we
better
take
a
hansom
they
left
hardy
stupefied
with
astonishment
as
they
drove
towards
charing
cross
she
turned
to
wyndham
and
said
forgive
my
making
use
of
you
had
you
any
other
engagement
i
have
no
engagements
i
am
glad
it
was
the
only
thing
i
could
think
of
to
get
rid
of
him
if
you
had
left
me
he
would
have
stayed
if
i
had
gone
out
by
myself
he
would
have
followed
but
it
was
good
of
you
to
stand
by
me
like
that
not
at
all
i
delighted
to
call
on
dean
craven
still
more
delighted
to
be
of
service
to
you
thank
you
they
said
no
more
till
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
hôtel
metropole
he
turned
to
her
with
a
smile
do
you
remember
mr
jackson
mr
jackson
mr
jackson
she
shook
her
head
oh
yes
of
course
i
do
at
oxford
that
night
whatever
put
him
into
your
head
of
all
people
dean
craven
i
suppose
ridiculous
association
of
ideas
jackson
i
wonder
why
such
people
exist
so
do
i
do
you
know
i
hated
jackson
with
a
deadly
hatred
for
the
last
month
why
whatever
has
he
done
nothing
but
if
it
had
been
for
him
i
should
have
known
you
a
year
ago
the
hansom
drew
up
she
sank
back
into
her
corner
and
held
out
her
hand
i
say
now
i
not
equal
to
seeing
them
after
all
you
can
tell
them
you
seen
me
and
that
i
meant
to
call
very
well
is
he
to
drive
you
straight
home
yes
please
but
tell
him
to
go
the
longest
way
round
by
fulham
or
anywhere
he
said
got
out
and
gave
the
order
to
the
driver
as
the
hansom
turned
up
northumberland
avenue
he
caught
a
side
view
of
the
pathetic
little
face
through
the
window
then
she
was
whirled
away
from
him
towards
fulham
or
anywhere
he
stood
looking
after
her
till
the
sound
of
the
horse
bells
was
lost
in
the
roar
of
charing
cross
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
once
said
she
would
be
capable
of
anything
chapter
xviii
hardy
left
the
house
five
minutes
after
audrey
and
wyndham
in
the
doorway
of
the
he
stepped
on
a
small
muslin
it
was
stained
here
and
there
with
specks
of
blood
he
picked
it
up
kissed
it
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
for
a
long
time
after
that
he
had
no
clear
sense
of
anything
except
at
times
of
the
misery
that
made
the
only
difference
between
being
drunk
and
sober
yes
hardy
was
carrying
out
the
threat
he
had
made
to
audrey
with
a
passionate
deliberation
he
was
giving
his
whole
mind
to
it
as
he
had
said
he
had
been
used
to
speak
of
the
sins
of
his
past
life
with
that
exaggeration
which
was
part
of
his
character
they
had
been
slight
considering
the
extent
of
his
temptation
then
he
was
as
it
were
an
amateur
in
evil
now
he
had
an
object
in
view
he
was
sinning
for
the
wages
of
sin
after
all
there
was
a
boyish
simplicity
about
hardy
otherwise
the
idea
of
living
for
a
year
alone
on
the
rockies
to
make
himself
fit
to
love
audrey
would
hardly
have
occurred
to
him
as
it
was
that
guileless
scheme
proved
fatal
in
its
results
the
loneliness
the
privation
the
excitement
and
fatigue
of
his
sportsman
life
for
with
all
his
boasting
he
was
a
true
sportsman
had
roused
some
old
hereditary
impulse
in
his
blood
and
he
found
himself
worsted
by
the
craving
for
drink
before
he
was
aware
of
its
existence
in
him
but
the
thought
of
audrey
was
always
present
with
him
and
it
kept
him
up
he
fought
himself
hand
to
hand
and
won
the
fight
ten
times
for
once
that
he
was
beaten
he
was
literally
saved
by
hope
happily
for
him
when
he
had
finished
the
stores
he
brought
out
with
him
it
was
almost
as
difficult
to
satisfy
his
craving
as
it
was
to
annihilate
it
when
he
came
home
the
tendency
was
sleeping
in
him
still
and
though
as
long
as
he
had
hope
it
might
have
slept
for
ever
when
hope
was
gone
it
was
there
ready
to
take
possession
of
him
his
love
for
audrey
was
the
strongest
passion
in
his
nature
it
filled
the
horizon
of
his
life
he
looked
before
and
after
and
could
see
nothing
else
but
it
it
was
of
the
kind
that
deepens
through
its
own
monotony
now
that
audrey
had
cast
him
off
there
was
no
reason
for
the
struggle
because
there
was
nothing
more
to
struggle
for
and
nothing
to
live
for
unless
it
were
to
kill
life
in
the
act
of
living
that
indeed
was
something
after
the
first
month
or
so
of
it
he
had
no
further
interest
in
his
present
course
he
chose
it
now
as
the
form
of
suicide
least
likely
to
be
recognised
as
such
perhaps
who
knows
if
he
had
had
any
friends
who
would
have
given
him
a
helping
hand
it
might
never
have
come
to
this
but
in
the
first
place
hardy
had
no
home
that
could
be
called
a
home
his
mother
was
fond
of
him
in
her
way
but
she
was
now
a
hysterical
invalid
abject
under
the
influence
of
her
second
husband
and
year
by
year
his
jealousy
the
jealousy
of
a
childless
man
had
driven
the
mother
and
son
further
apart
of
the
havilands
whom
he
would
naturally
have
turned
to
he
had
seen
nothing
for
the
last
few
months
ted
disliked
meeting
him
and
he
on
his
part
was
equally
anxious
to
avoid
ted
that
was
how
katherine
remained
ignorant
of
the
truth
until
she
was
enlightened
by
rogers
it
y
business
said
that
excellent
woman
as
she
began
to
dust
the
studio
one
morning
in
the
leisurely
manner
that
katherine
dreaded
it
being
the
invariable
forerunner
of
conversation
and
i
do
know
who
business
it
is
but
somebody
ought
to
look
after
that
friends
ought
to
be
written
to
m
katherine
felt
a
pang
of
remorse
why
is
hardy
ill
i
did
say
he
was
ill
but
if
i
was
to
tell
miss
here
rogers
pursed
her
lips
not
so
much
to
impress
katherine
with
her
incorruptible
discretion
as
to
excite
interest
in
the
disclosures
she
meant
to
make
between
you
and
me
m
if
somebody
do
stop
drink
to
death
down
there
some
o
these
days
what
do
you
mean
it
quite
impossible
i
known
hardy
all
my
life
i
known
three
months
and
if
i
was
that
i
would
keep
a
day
longer
not
a
day
i
would
wo
sleep
in
bed
like
a
christian
lies
on
top
all
of
a
heap
like
last
week
when
i
was
out
his
bottom
cupboard
the
brandy
bottles
was
standin
up
like
a
row
o
ninepins
this
mornin
they
was
lyin
down
flat
as
your
fyce
empty
m
every
one
of
it
did
give
me
a
turn
and
order
dinner
for
eight
and
not
come
till
two
in
the
mornin
if
comes
at
all
out
now
lord
knows
where
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
you
very
likely
mistaken
i
wish
i
was
miss
but
you
not
deceive
me
i
that
upset
with
it
all
and
my
fear
is
miss
drive
away
my
old
lydy
on
the
first
floor
with
goings
on
katherine
left
the
room
too
deeply
grieved
to
bear
professional
loquacity
that
night
she
was
able
to
realise
the
truth
of
what
she
had
been
told
she
had
gone
out
to
dine
with
some
new
acquaintance
ted
had
called
for
her
to
take
her
home
and
they
were
walking
back
along
the
embankment
when
they
came
suddenly
upon
hardy
he
was
standing
under
a
talking
to
somebody
or
rather
listening
to
somebody
talking
he
turned
his
back
on
them
as
they
passed
but
there
was
no
mistaking
his
figure
in
the
glare
of
the
false
daylight
as
for
his
companion
katherine
was
aware
of
something
in
satin
skirts
which
the
gaslight
ran
over
like
water
something
that
smelt
of
musk
and
had
hair
the
colour
of
brass
she
walked
on
without
a
word
sick
at
heart
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
brought
face
to
face
with
the
hideous
side
of
life
like
many
good
women
she
thoroughly
realised
the
existence
of
evil
in
the
abstract
but
evil
incarnate
in
a
person
it
was
hard
to
associate
that
with
any
one
she
knew
as
she
had
known
vincent
her
artistic
nature
was
morbidly
sensitive
to
impressions
taken
in
through
the
eye
and
nothing
could
have
so
forced
home
the
truth
as
that
little
scene
suddenly
flashed
on
her
out
of
the
london
night
but
now
that
she
had
seen
it
was
not
the
horror
that
she
felt
but
the
pity
of
it
she
remembered
vincent
face
when
she
had
shown
him
audrey
picture
her
thoughts
went
further
back
she
remembered
him
a
boy
playing
with
her
in
a
lordly
manner
as
befitted
his
sex
or
a
young
man
coming
and
going
in
her
father
home
with
frank
brotherly
ways
she
remembered
how
she
had
grudged
the
time
she
gave
him
and
the
relief
she
felt
when
he
left
off
coming
but
she
could
not
remember
anywhere
the
least
sign
of
what
he
had
become
something
ought
to
be
done
she
could
not
clearly
say
what
writing
to
his
people
as
rogers
had
suggested
was
out
of
the
question
she
knew
too
well
the
state
of
things
in
his
home
to
be
sure
there
was
his
uncle
sir
theophilus
parker
whom
he
had
expectations
from
but
for
that
very
reason
the
old
gentleman
was
the
last
person
whom
it
would
be
advisable
to
inform
of
vincent
conduct
relations
failing
there
remained
his
friends
and
she
only
knew
two
of
these
herself
and
ted
all
that
was
most
fine
and
sensitive
in
her
nature
cried
out
against
the
burden
she
knew
she
would
have
to
lay
on
it
but
her
humanity
was
so
deeply
moved
by
the
tragedy
she
had
twice
been
an
unwilling
spectator
of
that
she
never
so
much
as
dreamed
of
asking
am
my
keeper
doubtless
she
could
have
found
plenty
of
excellent
people
to
tell
her
she
was
not
her
only
difficulty
was
with
ted
nothing
could
be
done
till
he
had
got
over
his
nervous
dread
of
meeting
vincent
katherine
had
no
precise
idea
of
what
had
passed
between
her
brother
and
audrey
and
how
far
vincent
had
been
connected
with
it
but
she
had
gathered
from
ted
silence
all
that
she
wanted
to
know
whatever
audrey
had
said
or
done
there
was
an
end
of
her
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
it
was
from
the
boy
silence
too
that
she
realised
the
extent
of
his
suffering
before
the
inevitable
thing
had
happened
he
had
done
nothing
but
talk
of
audrey
sometimes
with
melancholy
more
often
in
the
jocular
strain
adopted
by
persons
to
carry
off
some
ridiculous
fatality
anger
following
suspense
had
driven
him
to
think
of
suicide
but
now
that
it
was
all
over
with
him
he
had
no
idea
of
killing
himself
katherine
had
never
been
much
afraid
of
that
and
as
yet
none
of
the
other
things
she
had
dreaded
had
happened
but
it
was
evident
that
the
boy
nature
had
been
deeply
affected
and
that
the
shock
was
a
moral
one
it
was
not
audrey
unfaithfulness
that
had
hurt
him
so
much
as
her
untruthfulness
ted
thought
so
little
of
himself
in
some
ways
that
he
could
have
understood
the
one
and
therefore
forgiven
it
the
other
was
the
unpardonable
sin
it
injured
what
he
loved
better
than
himself
his
idea
of
audrey
katherine
did
not
know
this
but
she
saw
that
the
present
time
was
the
moral
in
his
life
and
that
his
pain
was
the
sort
that
shapes
character
for
good
or
for
evil
but
after
all
she
knew
very
little
of
the
elements
that
went
to
make
up
ted
character
his
imagination
as
she
had
pointed
out
to
audrey
on
a
memorable
occasion
had
been
developed
long
before
his
heart
and
out
of
all
proportion
to
it
it
had
so
happened
that
all
at
once
the
passionate
part
of
his
nature
had
been
roused
and
shaken
before
it
was
she
asked
herself
what
line
would
be
taken
now
by
those
forces
of
feeling
set
free
so
violently
and
so
abruptly
checked
well
at
any
rate
audrey
conduct
had
not
had
the
effect
of
driving
brother
and
sister
apart
it
had
drawn
them
closer
together
if
anything
ted
seemed
to
find
relief
in
katherine
society
from
the
torment
of
his
own
thoughts
and
he
had
shown
no
desire
to
look
for
distraction
abroad
indeed
the
difficulty
was
to
make
him
go
out
of
doors
at
all
for
necessary
exercise
he
would
have
fits
of
work
when
nothing
would
induce
him
to
stir
from
the
easel
another
time
he
would
spend
whole
mornings
lying
on
the
floor
with
his
arms
clasped
above
his
head
or
sitting
with
a
book
in
his
hands
a
book
which
he
never
seemed
to
read
he
hardly
ever
spoke
he
was
always
thinking
and
worse
than
all
he
had
lost
his
appetite
and
his
sense
of
humour
rogers
had
her
own
theory
on
the
subject
which
she
imparted
to
katherine
miss
it
them
baths
as
has
done
it
anythin
in
reason
and
i
not
sy
no
but
cold
water
to
that
igstent
m
it
against
nature
it
my
belief
would
slept
and
dinner
in
bath
if
i
put
my
foot
down
chilled
blood
depend
upon
it
m
and
indeed
that
seemed
very
likely
katherine
said
nothing
about
hardy
at
the
time
but
the
next
night
when
she
and
ted
were
sitting
over
the
fire
she
began
ted
that
was
vincent
we
saw
on
the
embankment
last
night
yes
i
saw
him
do
you
know
i
believe
he
killing
himself
with
drinking
i
know
he
is
do
you
think
we
could
do
anything
to
help
him
before
it
too
late
he
shook
his
head
oh
ted
we
might
he
never
used
to
be
like
this
he
got
no
one
to
speak
to
we
left
him
by
himself
all
this
time
in
those
horrid
rooms
the
alone
is
enough
to
send
anybody
to
the
bad
we
might
have
thought
of
him
i
done
nothing
else
but
think
of
him
for
the
last
two
months
we
ca
do
anything
he
bound
to
go
on
like
that
i
do
see
how
he
can
help
it
as
for
drinking
nothing
can
stop
i
seen
fellows
like
him
before
and
vincent
never
did
anything
by
halves
it
terrible
but
we
ought
to
try
it
the
least
we
can
do
the
least
can
do
is
to
keep
out
of
his
way
he
hates
the
sight
of
me
why
do
you
know
did
it
ever
strike
you
that
audrey
was
engaged
to
vincent
all
the
time
no
i
thought
he
liked
her
but
what
makes
you
think
that
i
ca
tell
you
but
any
sort
of
affectionate
advances
would
come
rather
badly
from
me
how
vincent
to
know
that
i
never
knew
you
may
be
sure
he
knows
he
knows
audrey
ted
sighed
but
he
said
nothing
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
would
you
very
much
mind
asking
him
to
supper
night
no
he
wo
come
but
you
better
write
to
him
yourself
or
else
he
think
you
do
want
him
she
wrote
a
note
and
ted
took
it
downstairs
to
be
ready
for
vincent
at
such
time
as
he
should
come
in
the
boy
turned
into
his
own
room
without
going
up
again
to
say
he
had
left
katherine
thinking
she
had
been
struck
with
his
words
they
had
thrown
a
new
light
on
his
character
his
tone
was
bitter
when
he
told
her
he
had
been
thinking
of
nothing
but
vincent
but
it
was
not
the
bitterness
of
selfish
resentment
a
shuddering
hope
went
through
her
either
there
always
had
been
things
in
ted
nature
which
she
had
never
suspected
or
he
had
just
begun
his
education
by
suffering
by
having
felt
the
latter
was
the
more
probable
explanation
she
knew
him
to
be
capable
of
such
absorption
in
pleasant
sensations
that
if
all
had
gone
well
with
him
he
might
from
sheer
have
remained
indifferent
to
other
people
woes
and
all
along
he
had
been
such
an
irresponsible
person
but
now
he
was
actually
growing
a
conscience
and
a
peculiarly
delicate
one
too
without
any
fault
of
his
own
he
had
behaved
dishonourably
to
vincent
and
apart
from
the
blow
to
his
own
honour
it
was
evident
that
what
stung
him
now
was
remorse
for
his
infinitesimal
share
in
the
causes
that
had
led
to
vincent
ruin
in
all
that
he
had
said
there
was
no
trace
of
any
lingering
love
for
audrey
was
it
possible
that
the
tragic
spectacle
of
vincent
fate
had
moved
him
too
with
pity
and
terror
for
the
purging
of
his
passion
hardy
did
not
find
katherine
note
till
late
next
morning
he
read
it
twice
over
with
an
incredulous
air
and
put
it
into
the
fire
he
wrote
a
short
but
grateful
refusal
saying
truly
that
he
was
very
seedy
and
not
pleasant
company
for
any
one
at
present
not
long
after
he
was
alone
as
usual
in
his
dingy
it
was
about
five
but
he
had
not
lit
his
lamp
yet
and
he
had
let
his
fire
go
out
though
it
was
cold
and
rainy
a
from
the
street
shone
through
the
dripping
bringing
a
dreary
twilight
into
the
room
making
it
one
with
the
melancholy
of
the
streets
he
sat
by
the
table
with
his
head
in
his
hands
a
prey
to
the
appalling
depression
which
was
his
mood
when
sober
for
the
last
three
months
he
had
had
a
curious
double
consciousness
of
himself
as
an
actor
in
a
phantom
world
lost
in
some
night
of
dreams
where
the
same
thoughts
always
the
same
thoughts
thoughts
that
were
sins
came
to
him
in
sickening
recurrence
the
horror
of
it
being
that
the
act
followed
instantaneously
on
the
thought
of
himself
as
a
spectator
separate
from
that
other
self
yet
bound
to
it
looking
on
at
all
it
did
ashamed
and
loathing
yet
powerless
to
interfere
and
as
happens
in
nightmares
his
very
dread
suggested
the
thing
he
dreaded
and
changed
his
dream
to
something
more
hideous
than
before
horror
upon
horror
still
foreseen
and
still
foredoomed
in
the
senseless
sequence
of
the
dream
now
these
two
states
of
mind
were
divided
by
a
little
clear
space
the
passive
self
was
free
for
a
while
and
could
think
it
could
think
that
was
all
he
was
waked
from
his
thoughts
by
a
knock
and
a
voice
at
the
door
he
answered
gruffly
and
as
he
looked
up
he
saw
katherine
standing
in
the
open
doorway
letting
in
a
stream
of
light
from
the
lamp
she
carried
in
her
hand
he
stared
at
her
stupidly
blinking
at
the
light
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
again
i
beg
your
pardon
vincent
i
knocked
and
i
thought
you
said
in
i
came
to
see
how
you
were
i
was
afraid
you
were
worse
i
am
worse
what
more
i
shall
never
be
better
she
put
her
lamp
on
the
chimneypiece
and
stood
beside
him
do
say
that
of
course
you
be
better
can
we
do
anything
for
you
no
nothing
thanks
she
moved
back
a
little
and
shaded
the
lamp
with
her
hands
she
was
afraid
to
disturb
him
but
she
did
not
like
to
leave
him
in
his
misery
how
ill
and
wretched
he
looked
in
that
abominable
room
the
lamplight
showed
her
all
its
repulsive
details
she
had
done
her
best
for
it
but
in
the
last
two
months
it
had
sunk
back
into
something
worse
than
its
former
ugliness
degraded
in
its
owner
degradation
there
was
no
trace
now
of
the
clever
alterations
and
contrivances
which
she
had
devised
for
his
comfort
the
muslin
curtains
she
had
lent
him
were
dark
with
smoke
the
rug
had
slipped
from
the
horsehair
sofa
there
were
stains
on
the
shabby
tablecloth
and
carpet
and
on
the
sideboard
there
was
a
sordid
litter
of
bottles
and
glasses
pipes
and
hardy
hats
the
floor
was
strewn
with
the
crumpled
papers
and
shoes
that
he
had
flung
away
from
him
in
his
fits
of
irritation
in
the
midst
of
it
all
she
noticed
that
rogers
had
brought
back
all
her
terrible
household
goods
the
pink
vases
the
paper
screens
and
the
antimacassars
to
cheer
him
up
i
suppose
poor
fellow
hardy
looked
round
as
if
he
had
read
her
thoughts
you
better
leave
me
this
is
a
nice
place
for
you
it
is
a
very
nice
place
for
anybody
you
let
your
fire
go
out
come
upstairs
and
get
warm
we
have
seen
you
for
ages
he
shook
his
head
sadly
i
ca
sis
i
much
too
seedy
nonsense
you
will
be
if
you
sit
down
here
catching
cold
she
took
up
her
lamp
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
come
do
keep
me
waiting
or
i
shall
catch
cold
too
his
will
was
in
abeyance
and
to
her
intense
relief
he
got
up
and
followed
her
she
was
shocked
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
when
she
saw
him
in
the
full
lamplight
of
the
studio
he
was
pitifully
thin
his
fingers
as
he
held
out
his
hands
to
the
blaze
were
pale
even
with
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
through
them
his
eyes
had
lost
their
pathos
and
had
the
hard
look
of
the
human
animal
she
got
ready
some
strong
coffee
and
made
him
drink
it
that
with
the
warmth
and
the
unaccustomed
kindness
revived
him
then
she
sat
down
in
a
low
chair
opposite
him
with
some
sewing
in
her
lap
so
that
he
might
talk
to
her
or
not
as
he
pleased
at
first
he
evidently
preferred
to
think
and
when
he
did
speak
it
was
as
if
he
were
thinking
aloud
i
was
cut
by
two
men
i
know
i
wonder
how
many
women
there
are
in
london
who
would
do
what
you
done
for
me
what
have
i
done
i
walked
into
your
room
without
an
invitation
i
do
suppose
many
women
in
london
would
have
done
that
but
is
there
any
woman
in
london
who
has
known
you
as
long
as
i
have
he
winced
perceptibly
and
she
remembered
that
there
was
one
ah
if
you
really
knew
me
kathy
you
cut
me
dead
my
dear
vincent
do
talk
rubbish
i
do
know
a
good
deal
and
very
sorry
that
all
i
should
be
sorrier
if
i
thought
it
was
going
to
last
for
ever
but
i
do
you
are
too
good
to
me
but
if
you
only
knew
he
sat
silent
watching
as
she
sewed
something
in
his
attitude
reminded
her
of
that
other
evening
three
months
ago
when
he
had
lain
back
in
that
chair
boasting
gloriously
full
of
hope
and
the
pride
of
life
he
appealed
to
her
more
now
in
his
illness
and
degradation
than
he
had
ever
done
in
his
splendid
sanity
for
he
had
seemed
so
strong
there
was
no
outward
sign
of
weakness
then
about
that
athlete
vincent
she
said
presently
what
become
of
the
you
promised
to
read
me
some
of
it
do
you
remember
yes
i
shall
never
do
anything
with
it
now
oh
vincent
what
a
pity
but
if
it
not
to
be
printed
do
you
mind
my
seeing
the
manuscript
no
i
let
you
have
it
some
day
sis
and
you
shall
do
what
you
like
with
it
he
sank
into
silence
again
where
ted
he
asked
suddenly
he
be
in
soon
he
wants
to
see
you
does
he
how
do
you
know
that
there
was
a
look
of
suspicion
in
hardy
eyes
as
they
glanced
up
it
was
a
symptom
of
his
miserable
condition
that
he
was
apt
to
imagine
slights
i
only
his
word
for
it
of
course
kathy
he
hesitated
well
there
something
i
wanted
to
tell
him
but
the
fact
is
i
do
think
i
the
pluck
to
do
it
never
mind
then
tell
me
if
you
can
though
i
think
i
know
and
all
right
no
it
is
all
right
i
suppose
you
know
he
was
pretty
well
off
his
head
about
that
cousin
of
mine
i
rather
think
he
owed
me
one
for
being
before
him
as
he
thought
at
any
rate
he
cut
me
ever
since
before
i
took
to
the
flowing
bowl
too
you
might
tell
him
if
you
think
it
would
be
any
satisfaction
to
him
to
know
it
that
she
cared
rather
less
for
me
than
she
did
for
him
in
fact
i
believe
there
was
some
unhappy
devil
that
she
preferred
to
either
of
us
at
least
a
third
man
came
into
it
somewhere
there
may
be
a
fourth
now
for
anything
i
know
there
was
a
brutality
about
his
calmness
which
surprised
katherine
she
could
not
realise
the
effect
of
the
means
he
used
for
blunting
his
sensibilities
you
quite
mistaken
ted
has
any
feeling
of
the
sort
he
simply
kept
out
of
your
way
because
he
was
afraid
you
think
he
had
behaved
dishonourably
and
of
course
he
could
explain
because
of
audrey
but
it
was
his
fault
he
knew
nothing
i
never
thought
he
did
know
do
you
suppose
i
blamed
poor
beggar
all
the
same
hardy
slunk
away
soon
after
ted
came
in
when
rogers
came
up
with
supper
she
informed
them
that
it
was
fine
now
if
you
could
but
trust
it
and
gorn
orf
like
a
mad
thing
temptin
providence
i
call
it
without
an
umbrella
ted
remarked
as
they
sat
down
to
supper
that
he
thought
providence
would
have
sufficient
strength
of
mind
to
resist
temptation
but
he
was
not
so
sure
about
hardy
and
indeed
katherine
had
to
own
that
her
first
experiment
with
vincent
was
a
failure
but
she
struggled
on
experience
having
taught
her
that
it
is
easier
to
do
good
original
work
of
your
own
than
to
patch
up
what
other
people
have
spoiled
one
week
drawn
by
some
yearning
for
human
sympathy
hardy
would
come
nearly
every
evening
to
the
studio
then
they
would
see
no
more
of
him
for
ten
days
or
so
at
times
she
felt
that
the
strain
of
it
was
greater
than
she
could
bear
she
had
learnt
to
manage
vincent
in
his
various
moods
varying
from
humorous
irascibility
to
hysterical
penitence
but
when
he
was
out
of
her
sight
her
influence
was
powerless
now
indeed
she
asked
herself
why
am
i
wasting
my
precious
time
and
making
myself
miserable
in
this
way
i
no
sense
of
religion
and
i
do
love
vincent
he
simply
a
nuisance
it
must
be
sheer
obstinacy
it
was
with
a
feeling
little
short
of
despair
that
she
sat
down
to
the
pages
of
the
she
had
determined
at
any
cost
to
read
the
manuscript
through
but
she
soon
became
fascinated
in
spite
of
herself
be
tender
to
it
sis
it
a
part
of
myself
he
had
said
when
he
handed
it
over
to
her
she
thought
she
had
detected
a
gleam
of
interest
in
his
face
and
felt
that
she
was
on
the
right
tack
but
vincent
book
was
more
than
a
part
of
himself
it
was
a
fair
transcript
of
the
whole
his
weakness
and
his
strength
were
in
it
she
saw
his
vanity
his
exaggeration
but
also
his
sincerity
his
manliness
his
simple
delight
in
simple
things
scenery
on
a
large
scale
stirred
a
strain
of
rude
poetry
in
him
this
was
akin
to
the
first
rhythmic
utterances
of
man
to
be
sure
the
thing
had
its
faults
for
poor
vincent
had
been
anxious
that
his
book
should
be
recognised
as
the
work
of
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
at
times
a
spirit
of
unbridled
quotation
would
seize
him
and
you
came
upon
familiar
gems
from
the
classics
imbedded
in
the
text
at
times
after
some
coarse
but
graphic
touch
his
style
became
suddenly
refined
almost
to
sickliness
when
he
was
not
pointing
his
moral
with
a
hatchet
he
was
adorning
his
tale
with
verbiage
gathered
from
the
worst
authors
but
if
hardy
the
literary
artist
made
her
laugh
till
she
cried
again
hardy
the
unconscious
child
of
nature
won
her
heart
if
only
she
could
make
him
finish
what
he
had
begun
she
determined
to
illustrate
the
book
that
might
inflame
ambition
and
would
certainly
require
his
so
now
every
evening
in
the
spare
time
after
supper
she
set
to
work
on
the
drawings
aided
by
some
photographs
and
rough
sketches
made
by
hardy
after
a
little
stratagem
she
got
him
to
come
up
and
help
her
with
suggestions
or
to
sit
for
her
while
she
sketched
him
in
all
the
attitudes
of
the
sportsman
he
was
enthusiastic
over
the
first
few
drawings
perhaps
his
simple
remarks
h
that
clever
or
by
jove
that
not
half
bad
gave
her
a
purer
pleasure
than
she
could
have
derived
from
the
most
discriminating
criticism
when
his
interest
showed
signs
of
flagging
she
hit
on
a
new
means
of
rousing
it
she
began
to
find
out
that
so
long
as
she
drew
correctly
he
looked
on
with
a
melancholy
indifference
but
that
when
she
made
any
mistake
he
was
always
delighted
to
put
her
right
so
she
went
on
making
mistakes
and
then
vincent
got
impatient
look
here
sis
that
all
wrong
you
do
carry
a
rifle
with
the
muzzle
pointing
towards
your
left
ear
here
give
the
thing
to
me
katherine
gravely
handed
him
another
sketch
how
that
that
worse
why
you
little
duffer
you
do
suppose
i
going
to
send
a
bullet
into
that
bear
taking
aim
at
angle
i
should
blow
my
boots
off
i
thought
you
could
draw
she
smiled
in
secret
so
i
can
if
you
show
me
which
way
up
the
things
go
then
they
put
their
heads
together
over
it
and
between
them
they
turned
out
some
work
worthy
of
the
ted
joined
in
too
and
began
a
series
of
his
own
parodying
the
acts
of
the
distinguished
sportsman
vincent
attacked
by
a
skunk
vincent
swarming
up
a
pine
tree
with
a
bear
hanging
on
to
his
trousers
legs
vincent
shooting
the
rapids
in
his
canoe
canoe
uppermost
and
so
on
ted
was
so
much
entertained
with
his
own
performances
that
he
was
actually
heard
to
laugh
and
when
the
boy
laughed
the
man
laughed
too
as
for
katherine
she
could
have
cried
knowing
that
a
returning
sense
of
humour
is
often
the
surest
sign
of
hope
in
these
cases
laughter
flattery
and
feminine
wiles
may
not
be
the
methods
most
commended
by
moralists
and
divines
for
the
conversion
of
poor
sinners
but
katherine
seldom
consulted
authorities
she
had
the
courage
of
her
convictions
one
fine
morning
in
february
she
appeared
in
her
hat
and
jacket
at
the
door
of
the
vincent
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
zoo
i
going
to
do
some
grizzlies
and
wapiti
from
the
life
for
the
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
he
agreed
and
they
started
almost
gaily
with
rogers
peering
up
at
them
from
the
front
putting
that
and
that
together
with
the
ingenuity
of
her
kind
it
was
the
first
of
many
walks
they
had
together
ted
generally
went
with
them
but
now
and
again
he
was
left
behind
at
these
times
katherine
was
touched
by
vincent
pride
in
being
allowed
to
take
her
about
alone
he
was
grateful
for
it
he
knew
it
was
her
way
of
showing
that
she
trusted
him
at
last
the
series
of
illustrations
came
to
an
end
the
two
artists
had
raced
each
other
katherine
having
had
the
start
came
in
first
at
the
finish
with
a
magnificent
design
for
the
cover
she
brought
the
drawings
to
vincent
together
with
his
manuscript
and
showed
them
to
him
triumphantly
he
remarked
well
they
ought
to
print
the
thing
if
only
as
a
footnote
to
your
drawings
sis
will
you
sit
down
and
finish
it
if
i
undertake
to
find
a
publisher
he
promised
and
he
kept
his
word
in
the
mornings
now
he
might
be
found
working
slowly
and
painfully
at
his
last
chapter
she
helping
him
so
the
winter
wore
on
into
spring
and
katherine
burdened
with
arrears
of
work
said
to
herself
i
perceive
that
this
is
going
to
be
an
expensive
undertaking
but
she
looked
back
gladly
on
the
time
lost
at
last
after
many
failures
they
had
succeeded
in
wakening
vincent
to
a
sense
of
distant
kinship
with
the
life
of
boys
and
maidens
down
at
the
bottom
of
his
nature
there
had
always
been
an
intense
craving
for
affection
and
his
heart
went
out
to
ted
and
katherine
not
that
he
considered
himself
fit
for
their
blameless
society
together
with
the
vices
he
had
acquired
there
had
sprung
up
humility
that
strange
virtue
which
has
its
deepest
roots
in
the
soil
of
shame
but
all
his
old
yearning
after
goodness
revived
in
their
presence
when
he
was
with
them
he
felt
that
the
cloud
of
foul
experience
was
lifted
for
a
moment
from
his
mind
they
gave
him
sweet
thoughts
instead
of
bitter
for
a
day
perhaps
or
a
night
and
what
of
the
days
and
the
nights
when
he
was
not
with
them
then
as
a
rule
he
fell
nine
times
it
may
be
out
of
every
ten
who
knows
and
who
knows
whether
perfect
justice
measuring
our
forces
with
the
force
of
our
temptations
may
not
count
as
victory
what
the
world
calls
defeat
chapter
xix
in
her
appeal
to
wyndham
audrey
had
played
a
bold
stroke
and
it
seemed
that
she
had
won
it
she
had
amply
revenged
herself
on
hardy
and
more
than
assured
herself
of
wyndham
friendship
all
the
same
ever
since
she
had
left
him
at
the
doors
of
the
hôtel
metropole
a
certain
constraint
had
crept
into
their
intercourse
wyndham
was
not
easily
deceived
and
he
rightly
interpreted
her
abrupt
dismissal
of
him
as
a
final
effort
to
assert
herself
before
the
onset
of
the
inevitable
even
if
he
at
times
suspected
her
of
playing
a
part
she
had
chosen
the
right
part
to
play
and
he
respected
her
for
it
he
himself
was
leading
a
curious
double
life
he
was
working
hard
at
his
novel
which
promised
to
surpass
everything
that
he
had
yet
done
he
was
so
much
absorbed
in
observing
studying
shaping
and
touching
up
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
ask
himself
if
he
were
indeed
creating
the
thing
had
been
growing
under
his
hands
through
the
autumn
in
the
winter
it
seemed
to
advance
by
bounds
but
in
the
spring
his
work
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
he
did
not
know
what
laura
his
heroine
was
going
to
do
next
he
had
drawn
her
as
the
creature
of
impulse
but
dragging
the
dead
weight
of
all
the
conventions
at
her
back
a
woman
variously
dramatic
when
stirred
by
influences
from
without
but
incapable
of
decisive
action
from
within
how
would
such
a
woman
behave
under
stress
of
conflicting
circumstances
if
it
came
say
to
a
fight
for
possession
between
the
force
of
traditional
inertia
and
the
feeling
of
the
moment
on
the
one
hand
the
problem
was
as
old
as
the
hills
on
the
other
it
was
new
with
every
man
and
woman
born
into
the
world
what
he
called
his
literary
conscience
told
him
that
it
had
to
be
solved
another
conscience
in
him
shrank
from
the
solution
at
this
point
wyndham
did
what
as
a
conscientious
artist
he
had
never
done
before
he
put
his
work
away
for
a
season
and
tried
not
to
think
about
it
devoting
himself
to
audrey
craven
instead
even
he
was
not
always
able
to
preserve
the
critical
attitude
with
regard
to
her
as
he
had
told
her
criticism
comes
first
sympathy
last
of
all
and
with
him
last
of
all
it
had
come
he
could
not
go
on
from
day
to
day
seeing
hearing
and
understanding
more
and
more
without
acquiring
a
curious
sympathy
with
the
thing
he
studied
and
when
the
artist
tired
of
her
art
the
man
felt
all
the
influence
of
her
natural
magic
he
was
prepared
for
that
and
had
no
illusions
on
the
subject
he
tested
his
present
feelings
by
comparing
them
with
those
he
had
had
for
alison
fraser
he
had
not
the
least
intention
of
setting
up
audrey
craven
anywhere
near
his
idol
ancient
place
he
would
have
shuddered
at
the
bare
idea
of
it
this
though
he
expressed
it
differently
was
what
he
meant
when
he
resolved
once
for
all
that
he
would
never
marry
never
put
himself
in
any
woman
power
again
and
in
the
plenitude
of
his
he
knew
exactly
how
far
he
could
let
himself
go
without
either
of
these
evil
results
following
unfortunately
in
these
cases
the
woman
is
seldom
so
well
equipped
for
as
the
man
owing
to
her
invincible
ignorance
of
her
own
nature
she
must
be
more
or
less
at
a
disadvantage
and
if
this
is
true
of
women
in
general
it
was
doubly
true
of
any
one
so
specially
prone
to
illusion
as
audrey
craven
who
would
have
had
difficulty
in
recognising
any
part
of
her
true
self
under
its
numerous
disguises
she
was
therefore
unaware
of
the
action
and
reaction
which
had
been
going
on
within
her
during
the
last
year
whatever
its
precise
quality
may
have
been
her
love
for
ted
haviland
was
of
a
different
quality
from
her
feeling
for
langley
wyndham
under
that
earlier
influence
whatever
intelligence
she
possessed
had
been
roused
from
its
torpor
by
the
tumult
of
her
senses
her
mind
had
been
opened
and
made
ready
for
the
attack
of
a
finer
intellectual
passion
which
again
in
its
turn
brought
her
under
the
tyranny
of
the
senses
for
though
her
worst
enemies
could
not
call
audrey
clever
it
was
wyndham
intellectual
eminence
which
had
fascinated
her
from
the
first
herein
lay
her
danger
and
her
excuse
she
was
aware
hence
her
late
access
of
reserve
that
she
was
being
carried
away
by
her
feelings
but
how
when
and
whither
she
neither
knew
nor
apparently
cared
to
know
in
the
meanwhile
in
wyndham
friendship
she
not
only
triumphed
over
vincent
scorn
but
she
felt
secure
against
his
infatuation
for
she
imagined
the
scorn
and
the
infatuation
as
still
existing
together
she
knew
that
he
was
still
in
london
presumably
unable
to
tear
himself
away
from
her
neighbourhood
and
the
sense
of
his
presence
of
his
power
over
her
had
been
so
long
a
habit
of
her
mind
that
she
could
not
lose
it
now
otherwise
she
hardly
gave
him
a
thought
and
having
cut
herself
off
from
all
communication
with
devon
street
she
did
not
certainly
know
what
had
become
of
him
she
had
yet
to
learn
towards
the
end
of
february
she
received
a
letter
from
vincent
mother
which
left
no
doubt
on
the
subject
the
news
of
his
downfall
had
reached
his
home
at
last
hardy
knew
of
her
son
attachment
to
his
cousin
and
had
always
had
fixed
ideas
on
that
point
on
being
told
that
he
had
gone
irretrievably
to
the
bad
she
jumped
to
a
conclusion
it
was
the
right
one
as
it
happened
though
she
had
managed
to
cover
a
great
deal
of
ground
in
that
jump
she
at
once
wrote
off
a
long
and
violent
letter
to
her
niece
taxing
her
with
cruelty
fickleness
and
ingratitude
laying
vincent
misdeeds
on
her
shoulders
and
ending
thus
they
tell
me
you
are
engaged
i
pray
god
you
may
not
have
to
go
through
what
you
have
made
my
darling
boy
suffer
now
either
the
poor
hysterical
lady
was
an
unconscious
instrument
in
the
hands
of
destiny
or
her
prayer
may
have
been
meant
as
a
modified
and
curse
at
any
rate
if
it
had
not
entered
into
her
head
to
write
that
letter
it
would
have
saved
the
writing
of
one
chapter
in
her
niece
history
but
in
the
first
place
the
communication
had
the
effect
of
making
audrey
cry
a
great
deal
for
her
in
the
second
it
came
by
an
afternoon
post
so
that
langley
wyndham
calling
at
his
usual
hour
found
her
crying
he
was
a
little
taken
aback
by
the
sight
as
indeed
any
man
would
have
been
for
most
women
of
his
acquaintance
arranged
things
so
as
not
to
do
their
crying
in
calling
hours
however
he
judged
it
the
truest
kindness
to
sit
down
and
talk
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
it
requires
considerable
and
command
of
language
to
sit
still
and
talk
about
the
weather
with
a
woman
tears
falling
before
you
like
rain
and
even
langley
wyndham
that
studious
cultivator
of
phrases
found
it
hard
audrey
herself
relieved
him
from
his
embarrassment
by
frankly
drying
her
eyes
and
saying
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
mean
that
to
happen
but
he
glanced
at
the
letter
open
in
her
lap
not
bad
news
i
hope
she
answered
with
a
sob
verging
on
the
hysterical
wyndham
looked
frightened
at
that
and
she
checked
herself
in
time
no
it
nothing
at
least
i
ca
speak
about
it
and
yet
if
i
did
i
believe
i
should
feel
better
i
am
so
miserable
i
am
truly
sorry
i
wish
i
could
be
of
some
use
if
you
thought
you
could
speak
about
it
to
me
you
know
you
can
trust
me
i
know
i
can
oh
if
i
could
only
tell
you
but
i
ca
why
not
would
it
be
so
very
hard
i
be
able
to
help
you
you
might
i
do
want
somebody
advice
so
much
you
are
always
welcome
to
mine
you
need
take
it
you
know
she
smiled
through
her
tears
for
she
had
acquired
a
faint
sense
of
humour
under
ted
influence
and
had
not
yet
lost
it
well
it
about
vinc
my
cousin
hardy
you
remember
meeting
him
here
once
i
do
indeed
you
may
remember
something
i
told
you
about
him
then
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
told
you
never
mind
that
yes
i
remember
perfectly
has
he
been
persecuting
you
again
well
no
i
have
seen
him
for
ages
but
i
live
in
dread
of
seeing
him
every
day
i
know
sooner
or
later
he
will
come
she
paused
i
wonder
if
i
really
could
tell
you
everything
please
do
or
tell
me
as
much
as
you
care
to
i
like
to
help
you
if
you
would
let
me
she
went
on
in
a
low
voice
rather
suggestive
wyndham
thought
of
the
confessional
i
was
engaged
to
him
once
long
ago
he
forced
me
into
it
it
began
when
we
were
children
he
always
made
me
do
everything
he
wanted
then
he
went
away
immediately
after
for
a
year
when
he
came
back
i
do
know
how
it
was
i
suppose
it
was
because
he
had
been
away
so
long
but
i
was
stronger
he
seemed
to
have
lost
his
hold
over
me
and
i
i
broke
it
off
she
looked
away
from
wyndham
as
she
spoke
he
wondered
is
she
acting
all
the
time
if
so
how
admirably
she
does
it
she
must
be
a
cleverer
woman
than
i
thought
but
she
is
a
clever
woman
therefore
but
audrey
went
on
before
he
could
draw
a
conclusion
but
i
know
some
day
he
will
come
back
and
make
it
begin
all
over
again
and
i
shall
have
no
power
and
the
thought
of
it
is
horrible
there
was
no
mistaking
the
passion
in
her
voice
this
time
he
said
to
himself
this
is
nature
and
he
felt
the
same
cold
shiver
of
sympathy
that
sometimes
ran
through
him
at
the
performance
of
some
splendid
actress
but
before
he
could
presume
to
sympathise
he
must
judge
do
you
mind
telling
me
one
thing
had
you
any
graver
reasons
for
breaking
it
off
than
what
you
have
told
me
yes
he
drinks
brute
that
enough
but
supposing
he
did
drink
it
would
make
no
difference
i
never
cared
for
him
he
thought
i
did
i
could
help
that
could
i
and
then
afterwards
so
many
things
happened
i
was
not
the
same
person
if
he
had
not
begun
to
do
that
still
it
would
have
been
impossible
but
he
wo
believe
it
or
else
he
does
care
he
persecute
me
again
and
perhaps
make
me
marry
him
my
dear
miss
craven
he
wo
do
that
people
do
do
those
things
in
the
nineteenth
century
you
only
got
to
state
clearly
that
you
have
anything
to
say
to
him
and
he
ca
do
anything
if
he
tries
to
there
are
measures
that
can
be
taken
she
shook
her
head
dismally
now
comes
the
advice
shall
i
tell
you
the
truth
you
been
worrying
your
brain
over
that
wretched
animal
till
your
nerves
are
all
upset
you
ill
practically
or
you
could
take
this
morbid
view
of
it
you
ought
to
leave
town
and
go
away
for
a
change
where
could
i
go
to
the
south
coast
for
choice
it
bracing
if
i
only
could
no
i
ca
leave
london
why
not
there
an
excellent
service
of
trains
because
because
i
love
london
so
do
i
for
many
reasons
there
no
place
like
it
to
my
mind
but
if
i
overworked
myself
in
it
i
should
tear
myself
away
you
can
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
no
not
of
the
only
place
on
earth
you
care
to
be
in
well
i
given
my
valuable
advice
you
not
going
to
take
it
i
never
thought
you
would
personally
i
hate
the
people
who
give
me
advice
what
i
should
like
to
give
you
would
be
help
but
the
question
is
am
i
able
to
give
it
have
i
even
the
right
to
offer
it
she
looked
up
at
him
some
lyric
voice
whether
of
hope
or
joy
or
both
had
called
the
soul
for
an
instant
to
her
face
a
poor
little
fluttering
soul
that
gazed
out
through
her
grey
eyes
at
wyndham
for
an
instant
only
and
was
seen
no
more
when
he
spoke
he
spoke
not
to
it
but
to
the
woman
he
had
known
you
do
answer
she
had
answered
and
he
knew
it
it
all
comes
back
to
what
i
said
long
ago
the
most
elementary
knowledge
of
life
would
have
saved
you
all
this
if
you
had
it
you
could
not
have
let
these
fatuities
worry
you
to
this
extent
do
you
remember
my
telling
you
that
you
ought
to
love
life
for
its
own
sake
the
moment
he
had
said
the
words
he
would
have
given
anything
to
recall
them
but
it
was
too
late
she
remembered
only
too
well
however
she
had
disguised
the
truth
wyndham
passionate
defence
of
realism
was
not
altogether
an
appeal
to
her
intellect
he
ought
not
to
have
reminded
her
of
that
now
yes
she
answered
how
could
i
forget
i
said
at
the
time
that
you
must
know
life
in
order
to
love
it
and
i
say
so
now
but
audrey
she
started
and
flushed
if
i
were
another
man
i
should
not
say
that
what
would
you
say
that
you
must
love
in
order
to
know
is
there
any
need
to
tell
me
that
perhaps
not
it
what
i
would
have
told
you
then
if
i
had
been
another
man
her
lip
quivered
slightly
and
she
held
one
hand
with
the
other
to
give
herself
the
feeling
of
a
human
touch
he
went
on
without
the
least
idea
whether
he
were
talking
sense
or
nonsense
interrupted
sometimes
by
his
own
conscience
sometimes
by
audrey
changes
of
expression
bear
with
my
egoism
a
moment
several
moments
for
i
going
to
be
tediously
autobiographical
once
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
was
offered
some
journalistic
work
it
was
at
the
very
start
i
had
barely
tasted
print
remember
i
was
ambitious
and
it
meant
the
beginning
of
a
career
i
was
poor
and
it
meant
a
good
salary
but
it
meant
the
production
of
a
column
of
whether
i
was
in
the
vein
for
it
or
no
i
wanted
it
badly
and
i
refused
it
i
could
be
tied
down
since
then
i
have
never
bound
myself
to
any
publisher
or
editor
this
anecdote
is
not
in
the
least
interesting
but
it
is
characteristic
of
my
whole
nature
which
is
my
reason
for
inflicting
it
on
you
that
nature
may
be
an
unfortunate
one
but
i
did
invent
it
myself
anyhow
knowing
it
as
thoroughly
as
i
do
i
made
up
my
mind
never
to
do
certain
things
never
for
instance
to
ask
any
woman
to
be
my
wife
marriage
is
the
one
impossible
thing
it
involves
duty
or
worse
still
duties
now
as
it
happens
i
consider
duty
to
be
the
very
lowest
of
moral
motives
in
fact
do
be
shocked
it
is
moral
at
all
it
is
to
conduct
what
authority
is
to
belief
that
is
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
no
goodness
no
more
depends
on
duty
than
truth
depends
on
authority
forgive
me
i
know
you
are
a
metaphysician
and
a
moral
philosopher
and
you
appreciate
this
you
going
to
make
a
quotation
please
do
it
perfectly
useless
to
tell
me
that
wordsworth
calls
duty
daughter
of
the
voice
of
god
it
may
be
i
do
know
i
only
know
that
if
i
believed
it
was
my
to
live
commit
suicide
i
do
like
stern
daughters
but
granted
that
wordsworth
had
the
facts
at
his
god
voice
is
freedom
whatever
its
daughters
may
be
that
not
a
doctrine
i
preach
to
every
one
but
for
me
and
those
like
me
freedom
absolute
freedom
is
the
condition
of
all
sane
thinking
and
feeling
fancy
loving
any
one
because
it
was
your
duty
take
a
case
supposing
i
married
the
more
i
loved
my
wife
the
less
a
free
agent
i
should
be
and
when
i
once
realised
that
i
was
free
there
would
be
an
end
of
my
love
i
deplore
this
state
of
things
but
i
ca
alter
it
so
you
see
when
i
most
want
to
give
you
love
and
protection
i
can
only
offer
you
friendship
which
you
want
perhaps
and
er
good
advice
which
you
wo
take
but
she
was
looking
beyond
him
far
away
as
i
ca
possibly
ask
you
to
accept
my
conditions
perhaps
the
cleverest
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
go
away
and
never
see
you
again
there
no
other
alternative
her
lips
parted
as
if
she
would
have
spoken
but
no
words
came
they
searched
each
other
faces
the
woman
thirsting
for
life
for
love
the
man
thirsting
too
for
knowledge
and
he
knew
it
was
his
turn
to
look
away
from
her
and
as
he
fixed
his
eyes
absently
on
the
corner
where
the
psyche
stood
motionless
on
her
pedestal
he
noticed
as
people
will
notice
at
these
moments
the
ironical
suggestion
of
the
torso
with
the
nasty
malay
creese
hanging
over
its
head
psyche
and
the
sword
of
damocles
i
do
want
you
to
go
away
she
said
at
last
i
am
going
all
the
same
for
a
little
while
a
fortnight
perhaps
i
want
you
to
have
time
to
think
he
was
not
by
any
means
sure
what
he
meant
by
that
he
had
solved
his
problem
though
not
quite
as
he
had
intended
to
and
that
was
enough
for
him
and
yet
his
conscience
not
the
literary
one
but
the
other
would
not
altogether
acquit
him
of
treachery
to
audrey
instead
of
going
away
as
he
ought
to
have
done
he
sat
on
talking
in
the
hope
of
silencing
the
reproachful
voice
inside
him
of
setting
things
on
their
ordinary
footing
again
but
this
was
impossible
at
the
moment
they
were
talking
now
across
some
thin
barrier
woven
of
trivialities
as
it
were
some
japanese
screen
with
all
sorts
of
frivolous
figures
painted
on
it
in
an
absurd
perspective
and
behind
this
flimsy
partition
their
human
life
went
on
each
soul
playing
its
part
more
or
less
earnestly
in
a
little
tragedy
of
temptation
each
knew
all
the
time
what
the
other
was
doing
though
wyndham
had
still
the
advantage
of
audrey
in
this
respect
which
of
them
would
first
have
the
courage
to
pull
down
the
screen
and
face
the
solid
impenetrable
truth
neither
of
them
attempted
it
they
dared
not
after
half
an
commonplaces
wyndham
left
her
to
think
he
too
had
some
matter
for
reflection
he
was
not
inhuman
and
if
at
times
he
seemed
so
he
had
ways
of
reconciling
his
inhumanity
to
his
conscience
he
told
himself
that
his
strictly
impartial
attitude
as
the
student
of
human
nature
enabled
him
to
do
these
things
he
was
as
a
higher
intelligence
looking
down
on
the
crowd
of
struggling
suffering
men
and
women
beneath
him
forgiving
tolerating
all
because
he
understood
all
he
who
saw
life
so
whole
who
knew
the
hidden
motives
and
causes
of
human
action
could
make
allowances
for
everything
there
was
something
divine
in
his
literary
charity
what
matter
then
if
he
now
and
then
looked
into
some
girl
expressive
face
and
found
out
the
secret
she
thought
she
was
hiding
so
cleverly
from
everybody
if
he
knew
the
sources
of
mysterious
illness
which
had
puzzled
the
doctors
so
long
and
what
if
he
had
obtained
something
more
than
a
passing
glimpse
into
the
nature
of
the
woman
who
had
trusted
him
it
would
have
been
base
impossible
in
any
other
man
of
course
the
impersonal
point
of
view
you
see
made
all
the
difference
chapter
xx
from
that
afternoon
wyndham
kept
away
from
chelsea
gardens
in
fact
he
had
left
town
to
do
him
justice
he
honestly
thought
he
was
doing
the
cleverest
thing
for
audrey
in
leaving
her
to
think
it
would
have
been
the
cleverest
thing
if
he
could
have
kept
away
altogether
but
as
long
as
she
had
the
certainty
of
his
return
it
was
about
the
stupidest
if
he
had
stayed
they
would
have
resumed
their
ordinary
relations
all
might
have
blown
over
like
a
mood
and
whatever
he
knew
about
her
audrey
herself
would
never
have
known
it
as
it
was
he
had
emphasised
the
situation
by
going
and
what
was
more
he
had
thrown
audrey
back
on
her
uninteresting
self
the
very
worst
company
she
could
have
had
at
present
she
had
been
used
to
seeing
him
almost
daily
through
a
whole
winter
he
had
made
her
dependent
on
his
society
for
all
her
interests
and
pleasures
and
when
she
was
suddenly
deprived
of
it
instead
of
being
able
to
think
she
spent
her
time
in
miserable
longing
she
could
not
think
and
feel
at
the
same
time
feeling
such
as
hers
was
incompatible
with
any
form
of
thinking
it
was
feeling
in
a
vacuum
the
most
dangerous
kind
of
all
the
emptiness
of
her
life
now
that
wyndham
was
gone
made
her
say
to
herself
that
she
could
bear
anything
anything
but
that
it
made
her
realise
what
the
years
the
long
unspeakable
years
would
be
like
when
she
had
given
him
up
she
looked
behind
and
around
her
and
there
were
the
grey
levels
of
ordinary
existence
she
looked
below
her
and
there
was
the
deep
she
was
going
into
the
darkness
of
it
swiftly
helplessly
blown
on
by
the
wind
of
vanity
she
saw
no
darkness
for
the
light
before
her
a
nebulous
light
but
it
dazzled
her
like
the
sun
shining
through
a
fog
once
at
the
fiercest
point
of
her
temptation
she
felt
an
impulse
to
confession
that
mysterious
instinct
which
lies
somewhere
at
the
heart
of
all
humanity
she
had
wild
thoughts
of
going
to
katherine
and
telling
her
all
asking
her
what
she
ought
to
do
katherine
was
she
would
not
blame
her
much
perhaps
she
would
tell
her
she
ought
not
to
give
wyndham
up
that
she
ought
to
think
of
him
to
be
ready
to
sacrifice
the
world
for
his
sake
yes
katherine
was
so
clever
she
would
be
a
good
judge
and
audrey
would
abide
by
her
judgment
unhappily
when
it
came
to
the
point
she
was
afraid
of
her
judgment
she
had
always
been
a
little
afraid
of
katherine
once
she
even
thought
of
going
to
flaxman
reed
that
holy
anachronism
as
she
had
once
heard
wyndham
call
him
but
his
judgment
was
a
foregone
conclusion
flaxman
reed
was
not
once
too
a
gleam
of
reason
came
to
her
she
loved
dearly
the
admiration
and
good
opinion
of
her
world
and
she
reflected
that
the
step
she
contemplated
meant
no
congratulations
no
no
presents
and
no
callers
wedding
indeed
as
she
had
read
of
a
similar
case
in
london
legends
it
would
be
a
social
funeral
with
no
flowers
by
request
but
these
considerations
had
no
weight
after
an
evening
spent
with
cousin
bella
and
though
she
played
on
her
piano
till
the
lace
butterflies
on
miss
craven
cap
fluttered
again
why
would
cousin
bella
wear
caps
in
defiance
of
the
fashion
it
was
no
good
if
she
had
had
a
fine
voice
she
would
have
sung
at
the
top
of
it
failing
that
medium
of
expression
she
longed
to
put
her
fingers
in
her
own
ears
and
scream
into
cousin
bella
and
as
they
yawned
in
each
other
faces
and
she
realised
that
something
like
this
might
be
the
programme
for
an
indefinite
time
she
remembered
how
langley
had
called
her
a
metaphysician
and
a
moral
philosopher
it
was
on
statements
like
these
apparently
borne
out
by
the
fact
of
his
friendship
that
she
based
the
flattering
fiction
of
her
own
intellectuality
without
that
fiction
audrey
could
not
have
supported
life
in
the
rare
atmosphere
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
breathe
the
conclusion
of
it
all
was
that
come
what
might
come
she
could
not
give
langley
up
one
afternoon
she
crossed
the
river
for
a
walk
in
battersea
park
it
was
a
warm
spring
and
down
the
long
avenue
the
trees
were
tipped
with
the
flame
of
bursting
buds
like
so
many
green
lights
turned
low
the
beds
and
borders
were
gay
with
crocuses
and
hyacinths
and
the
open
spaces
were
beginning
to
look
green
again
audrey
cared
little
for
these
things
but
she
was
somehow
aware
of
them
she
felt
in
her
the
new
life
of
the
spring
as
she
had
felt
it
a
year
ago
she
walked
rapidly
from
sheer
excitement
till
she
had
tired
herself
out
then
she
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
overlooking
the
waste
ground
where
the
children
played
except
for
a
bright
fringe
under
the
iron
railings
it
was
still
untouched
by
spring
and
the
sallow
grass
had
long
been
trodden
into
the
dust
some
ragged
little
cricketers
were
shouting
not
far
off
and
near
her
by
the
railings
was
a
family
group
a
young
father
and
mother
with
their
children
from
two
years
old
and
upwards
crawling
around
them
they
were
enjoying
a
picnic
tea
in
the
sunshine
with
the
voluptuous
carelessness
of
outward
show
that
marks
the
children
of
the
people
audrey
looked
at
it
all
with
a
faint
disgust
but
she
was
too
tired
to
move
on
to
a
more
cheerful
spot
she
turned
her
back
on
the
picnic
party
and
began
to
think
about
wyndham
he
had
been
away
ten
days
he
said
he
was
going
for
a
fortnight
in
another
week
at
the
longest
she
would
see
him
she
was
roused
by
a
tug
at
her
petticoats
the
attracted
like
some
wild
animal
by
her
stillness
had
scrambled
through
the
railings
and
was
trying
to
pull
its
fat
little
body
up
by
one
hand
on
to
the
bench
beside
her
its
other
hand
grasped
firmly
a
sheaf
of
fresh
grass
it
was
clean
and
pretty
and
something
in
its
baby
face
sent
a
pang
to
audrey
heart
she
loosened
its
chubby
fingers
hoping
it
would
toddle
away
but
it
gave
a
wilful
chuckle
and
stood
still
staring
at
her
reproaching
accusing
in
the
unconscious
cruelty
of
its
innocence
and
yet
surely
the
divine
charity
had
chosen
the
tenderest
and
most
delicate
means
of
stirring
into
life
her
unborn
conscience
moved
by
who
knows
what
better
impulse
she
stooped
suddenly
down
and
touched
its
face
with
the
tips
of
her
gloved
fingers
startled
at
the
strange
caress
like
some
animal
stroked
too
lightly
the
little
thing
made
its
face
swell
and
asserted
its
humanity
by
a
howl
then
it
fled
from
her
with
a
passionate
waddle
scattering
blades
of
grass
behind
it
as
it
went
even
so
do
we
chase
away
from
us
the
ministers
of
grace
she
leaned
back
overcome
by
a
sort
of
moral
exhaustion
her
was
hurt
as
it
would
have
been
if
a
dog
had
shrunk
from
her
advances
for
audrey
was
not
accustomed
to
have
her
favours
rejected
she
was
further
irritated
by
the
ostentatious
affection
of
the
child
mother
as
she
helped
it
through
the
railings
with
shrill
cries
of
there
then
blessums
did
she
then
the
naughty
lydy
and
when
baby
echoed
naughty
lydy
it
was
as
if
the
had
judged
her
she
sat
a
little
while
longer
and
then
went
away
as
she
rose
she
looked
sadly
back
at
the
family
group
the
man
was
lying
on
his
back
and
letting
the
children
walk
about
on
the
top
of
him
baby
had
found
peace
in
sucking
an
orange
and
stamping
on
her
father
waist
the
woman
was
strewing
paper
bags
and
around
her
in
a
fine
disorder
while
she
thriftily
packed
the
remains
of
their
meal
in
a
basket
audrey
shuddered
their
arrangements
were
all
so
ugly
and
unpleasant
and
yet
they
were
married
they
were
respectable
they
were
happy
these
terrible
people
while
she
she
was
miserable
she
had
no
sense
of
justice
and
she
rebelled
against
the
policy
of
nature
who
leaves
her
coarser
children
free
and
levies
her
taxes
on
the
aristocracy
of
feeling
the
sordid
domesticity
of
the
scene
had
glorified
by
contrast
her
own
dramatic
mood
poor
audrey
she
hated
vulgarity
and
yet
she
was
trying
to
lay
hold
on
the
great
things
of
life
through
the
vulgarest
of
all
life
tragedies
langley
would
be
in
town
again
in
a
week
he
would
ask
if
she
had
made
up
her
mind
and
she
knew
now
too
well
the
answer
she
would
give
him
but
langley
was
not
in
town
again
in
a
week
nor
yet
in
a
fortnight
and
when
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
he
did
come
back
he
came
back
married
to
miss
alison
fraser
nobody
ever
knew
how
that
came
about
miss
gladys
armstrong
who
may
be
considered
an
authority
maintained
that
as
wyndham
had
the
pride
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
peculiar
property
of
the
evil
one
he
could
never
have
proposed
to
the
same
woman
twice
consequently
miss
fraser
must
have
proposed
to
him
perhaps
she
had
there
are
ways
of
doing
these
things
and
whatever
alison
fraser
did
she
did
gracefully
as
for
her
private
conscience
in
refusing
him
with
conscious
magnanimity
she
had
done
no
good
to
anybody
not
even
herself
in
marrying
him
finally
she
had
saved
the
situation
without
knowing
that
there
was
a
situation
to
be
saved
the
news
threw
audrey
into
what
she
imagined
to
be
the
beginning
of
a
brain
fever
but
which
proved
to
be
a
state
of
nervous
collapse
lasting
with
some
intermissions
for
a
fortnight
at
the
end
of
that
time
whether
it
was
that
she
was
so
fickle
a
creature
that
even
fate
could
make
no
abiding
impression
on
her
or
that
she
was
no
longer
burdened
with
the
decision
of
a
momentous
question
to
all
appearances
she
recovered
so
much
so
that
when
some
one
sent
her
an
invitation
to
the
private
view
at
the
new
gallery
she
put
on
her
best
clothes
not
without
a
pang
and
went
alas
the
place
was
full
of
associations
melancholy
with
the
sheeted
ghosts
of
the
past
this
time
last
year
she
had
been
to
the
private
view
with
ted
they
had
amused
themselves
with
laughing
at
the
pictures
and
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
one
of
his
would
be
hanging
there
and
as
she
listlessly
turned
the
pages
of
her
catalogue
the
first
names
that
caught
her
attention
were
haviland
katherine
haviland
edward
she
turned
back
the
pages
hastily
to
no
and
read
the
witch
of
atlas
that
picture
she
knew
no
gave
her
sappho
a
study
of
a
head
of
a
head
whose
head
she
found
the
picture
not
exactly
in
the
place
of
honour
but
agreeably
well
hung
and
with
a
small
crowd
before
it
and
recognised
striking
profile
raised
in
the
attitude
of
a
suppliant
who
implores
the
cloud
of
her
dark
hair
flaming
into
bronze
against
a
sunset
sky
ted
was
rather
too
fond
of
that
trick
but
the
study
was
not
a
mere
vulgar
success
he
had
achieved
expression
in
it
it
was
marked
sold
there
were
some
lines
of
verse
on
the
square
panel
at
the
base
of
the
frame
ted
could
not
have
afforded
such
a
setting
for
his
picture
but
the
frame
was
contributed
by
percival
knowles
the
purchaser
of
the
canvas
the
same
gentleman
was
also
the
author
of
the
verse
specially
written
for
the
portrait
knowles
was
an
occasional
poet
that
is
to
say
he
could
burst
into
poetry
occasionally
and
audrey
read
oh
aphrodite
queen
of
dread
desire
by
all
the
dreams
that
throng
love
golden
ways
by
all
the
honied
vows
thy
votary
pays
by
sacrificial
wine
and
holy
fire
thou
who
hast
made
my
heart
thy
living
lyre
hast
thou
no
gift
for
me
nor
any
grace
why
hast
thou
turned
the
light
of
love
sweet
face
from
me
the
sweetest
singer
of
love
choir
for
songs
that
charm
the
long
ambrosial
years
the
gods
bring
many
gifts
and
mine
shall
be
immortal
life
in
mortal
agony
vain
longing
fanned
by
wingèd
hopes
and
fears
to
inextinguishable
flame
and
tears
bitter
as
death
salt
as
the
lesbian
sea
her
breast
rose
and
fell
with
the
lines
by
this
time
she
was
educated
up
to
their
feeling
who
was
sappho
and
what
did
she
do
i
know
but
i
forgotten
asked
a
voice
in
the
crowd
oh
the
woman
who
threw
herself
at
the
other
fellow
head
you
know
who
naturally
did
appreciate
the
compliment
audrey
was
not
intelligent
enough
to
refrain
from
the
inward
comment
how
singularly
inappropriate
i
should
have
said
katherine
was
about
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
she
turned
round
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
poet
knowles
had
been
wandering
through
the
crowd
with
evasive
eyes
successfully
dodging
the
ladies
of
his
acquaintance
while
his
air
of
abstraction
took
all
quality
of
offence
from
the
unerring
precision
of
his
movements
but
when
he
saw
miss
craven
he
stopped
he
had
an
inkling
of
the
truth
and
respected
her
feelings
too
much
to
slight
her
while
wyndham
marriage
was
still
a
topic
of
the
hour
not
bad
for
the
boy
that
said
he
smiling
gently
at
sappho
coming
out
is
he
so
are
you
i
think
in
a
new
line
too
ah
er
not
quite
a
new
one
i
been
taken
that
way
before
she
was
about
to
make
some
pretty
speech
when
they
were
joined
by
ted
who
had
not
noticed
audrey
his
forehead
puckered
slightly
when
he
saw
her
but
that
was
no
doubt
from
sympathy
with
her
probable
embarrassment
for
the
first
time
in
their
acquaintance
he
was
indifferent
to
the
touch
of
the
small
hand
that
had
tried
to
mould
his
destiny
if
the
truth
must
be
told
in
the
flush
of
his
success
ted
had
found
out
that
his
passion
for
audrey
was
only
the
flickering
of
the
flame
on
the
altar
dedicated
to
eternal
art
he
listened
to
her
compliments
without
that
sense
of
apotheosis
which
however
low
he
rated
it
her
criticism
had
been
wont
to
produce
do
let
be
seen
looking
at
it
any
longer
he
said
at
last
go
and
pretend
to
get
excited
about
some
other
fellow
work
so
they
left
audrey
to
herself
she
turned
back
and
went
down
the
room
to
see
the
witch
of
atlas
the
lady
robed
in
her
subtle
veil
of
starbeams
and
mist
her
view
of
this
picture
was
somewhat
obstructed
by
a
stout
gentleman
who
together
with
a
thin
lady
was
taking
up
the
whole
of
the
available
space
before
it
his
companion
a
young
woman
with
a
double
was
trying
to
decipher
the
lines
quoted
in
her
catalogue
as
audrey
paused
she
looked
up
and
stared
as
only
a
woman
with
a
double
can
stare
at
the
same
time
attracting
the
stout
gentleman
attention
by
a
movement
of
her
elbow
look
uncle
quick
that
her
that
the
person
what
that
nettie
the
stout
gentleman
swung
round
as
if
on
a
pivot
as
audrey
moved
gracefully
by
you
do
mean
to
say
so
where
ted
she
walked
on
through
the
rooms
depressed
by
the
meeting
with
knowles
it
suggested
wyndham
she
would
be
meeting
next
and
indeed
she
met
him
in
the
first
gallery
where
her
aimless
wanderings
had
brought
her
again
his
wife
was
with
him
audrey
knew
that
she
must
meet
her
some
time
and
she
had
expected
to
see
in
alison
fraser
an
enlarged
edition
of
herself
she
had
even
feared
an
de
which
would
have
been
intolerable
she
was
prepared
for
distinction
but
she
saw
with
a
finer
agony
the
slight
figure
the
sweet
proud
face
with
its
setting
of
pale
gold
hair
and
worse
than
all
the
indefinable
air
of
remoteness
and
reserve
which
made
langley
wyndham
more
than
a
distinguished
woman
wyndham
lifted
his
hat
and
would
have
passed
on
but
audrey
to
show
her
perfect
stopped
and
held
out
her
hand
he
felt
it
trembling
as
he
took
it
in
a
preoccupied
manner
and
langley
wyndham
became
instantly
absorbed
in
picture
no
have
you
seen
young
haviland
performance
asked
wyndham
he
had
to
say
something
yes
it
a
very
fine
study
so
knowles
tells
me
but
everything
a
fine
study
in
this
collection
there
ought
to
be
fine
for
the
abuse
of
that
expression
but
it
really
is
go
and
see
for
yourself
it
his
sister
is
it
yes
ah
that
accounts
for
it
he
could
give
his
mind
to
it
in
that
case
wyndham
was
surprised
at
his
own
fatuity
his
remarks
sounded
like
the
weird
inanities
that
pass
for
witticisms
in
dreams
perhaps
but
never
mind
haviland
i
want
you
to
introduce
me
to
your
wife
wyndham
looked
round
his
wife
had
turned
an
unconscious
back
oh
er
thank
you
you
very
kind
but
er
we
just
going
he
had
not
meant
them
so
but
his
words
were
like
a
whip
laid
across
audrey
shoulders
he
moved
on
and
his
wife
joined
him
audrey
came
across
them
half
an
hour
later
stooping
over
some
designs
in
black
and
white
she
saw
langley
wyndham
look
up
in
her
husband
face
with
a
smile
raising
her
golden
eyebrows
the
look
was
one
of
those
intimate
trifles
that
have
no
meaning
beyond
the
two
persons
concerned
in
it
for
audrey
smarting
from
wyndham
insult
it
was
the
flick
of
the
lash
in
her
face
chapter
xxi
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
audrey
woke
and
found
herself
the
classic
of
the
hour
a
literary
queen
without
a
rival
wyndham
great
work
was
finished
and
it
stood
alone
not
another
heroine
of
fiction
could
lift
her
head
beside
laura
the
leading
character
of
an
idyll
of
piccadilly
he
himself
owned
almost
with
emotion
that
it
was
the
best
thing
he
had
ever
done
he
had
not
touched
the
surface
this
time
he
had
gone
deep
down
to
the
springs
of
human
nature
he
had
not
merely
analysed
the
woman
till
her
character
lay
in
ruins
around
him
but
he
had
built
her
up
again
out
of
the
psychic
atoms
and
laura
was
alive
she
showed
the
hand
of
the
master
by
her
own
nullity
in
her
splendid
vanity
she
was
like
some
piece
of
elaborate
golden
fretwork
from
which
the
substance
had
been
refined
by
excess
of
workmanship
the
voice
of
criticism
was
one
voice
there
arose
a
unanimous
hymn
of
praise
from
every
literary
organ
in
the
country
it
was
langley
wyndham
masterpiece
a
work
that
left
the
excellence
of
london
legends
far
behind
it
on
a
lower
plane
though
there
was
no
falling
off
in
point
of
style
the
author
had
found
something
better
to
do
this
time
than
to
cultivate
the
flowers
of
perfect
speech
laura
was
a
triumph
of
intimate
characterisation
and
the
brutal
touches
that
disfigured
his
former
work
were
absent
from
this
he
had
shown
us
that
the
boldest
most
inflexible
realism
is
compatible
with
a
delicacy
worthy
of
the
daintiest
of
esoteric
ideals
the
book
dedicated
to
my
wife
appeared
early
in
october
by
november
the
question
of
the
sources
was
opened
out
and
it
began
to
be
whispered
a
whisper
that
could
be
traced
to
the
private
utterances
of
miss
gladys
armstrong
that
the
prototype
of
laura
was
a
miss
audrey
craven
in
the
person
of
her
ubiquitous
double
miss
audrey
craven
became
a
leading
figure
in
london
society
then
bit
by
bit
the
news
got
into
the
papers
and
wyndham
was
followed
by
de
which
promised
to
treble
his
editions
thus
audrey
unable
to
achieve
greatness
had
greatness
thrust
upon
her
and
the
weight
of
it
bowed
her
to
the
earth
the
earth
as
she
read
on
the
earth
seemed
to
crumble
away
from
under
her
feet
leaving
her
baseless
and
alone
before
that
terrifying
apocalypse
wyndham
had
trained
her
intelligence
till
it
could
appreciate
the
force
of
every
chapter
in
his
book
of
revelations
at
last
she
saw
herself
as
she
was
and
yet
could
that
be
she
that
mixture
of
vanity
stupidity
and
passion
to
be
sure
he
had
been
careful
to
give
her
brown
hair
instead
of
red
and
skillfully
to
alter
the
plot
of
her
life
with
all
details
of
time
and
place
but
what
had
he
said
light
as
air
fluent
as
water
a
being
mingled
of
fire
and
a
little
earth
fickle
as
the
wind
that
blew
her
in
a
wavering
line
across
the
surface
of
things
modern
and
of
stuff
so
fine
that
it
chafed
under
the
very
breath
of
disapproval
and
yet
with
a
little
malleable
heart
in
it
compounded
of
the
most
primeval
of
affections
she
turned
over
the
pages
everywhere
she
came
upon
the
same
thing
now
the
phrases
were
spun
out
fine
they
were
subtle
they
seemed
to
cling
round
her
and
stifle
her
now
they
were
short
and
keen
and
they
cut
like
knives
women
may
be
divided
into
three
classes
the
virtuous
the
flirtuous
and
the
the
middle
class
is
by
far
the
largest
it
shades
off
finely
into
the
two
extremes
laura
belonged
to
it
the
moon
was
up
and
diana
divine
sportswoman
was
abroad
hunting
big
game
laura
had
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
she
said
that
proved
the
necessity
of
virtue
oh
the
cruelty
of
it
would
ted
would
vincent
have
done
this
if
they
had
had
it
in
their
power
true
they
had
reproached
her
but
it
was
to
her
face
alone
in
her
own
where
she
had
a
chance
of
defending
herself
would
not
have
held
her
up
to
public
scorn
and
they
had
some
right
to
blame
her
she
saw
that
now
but
what
had
she
done
to
deserve
this
from
langley
how
had
he
found
it
in
his
heart
to
speak
against
her
she
had
loved
him
yes
she
had
known
many
a
passing
pain
but
she
had
never
really
suffered
until
now
that
was
a
part
of
her
education
that
had
been
neglected
hitherto
only
an
accomplished
student
of
human
nature
could
have
coached
her
through
the
highest
branches
of
it
having
set
the
scandal
successfully
afloat
the
society
papers
began
to
utter
a
feeble
protest
against
it
thus
increasing
their
own
reputation
for
a
refined
morality
but
they
had
no
power
to
turn
the
tide
and
the
scandal
floated
on
in
society
itself
judgment
was
divided
whether
laura
was
or
was
not
a
work
of
the
highest
art
was
a
question
you
might
have
heard
discussed
at
every
other
perhaps
the
criticism
that
was
most
to
the
point
was
that
of
miss
gladys
armstrong
who
proclaimed
publicly
that
langley
wyndham
laboured
under
the
disadvantage
of
not
being
a
woman
and
having
no
imagination
to
make
up
for
it
meanwhile
the
tone
of
the
larger
reviews
remained
unchanged
the
reviewers
to
a
man
had
committed
themselves
to
the
position
that
the
book
was
wyndham
masterpiece
and
nobody
could
be
found
to
go
back
on
that
opinion
but
in
all
that
concert
of
adulation
one
voice
was
silent
the
only
voice
that
wyndham
cared
to
hear
that
of
percival
knowles
the
others
might
howl
in
chorus
and
it
would
not
be
worth
his
while
even
to
listen
he
was
looking
forward
to
knowles
long
impressive
solo
but
that
solo
never
came
neither
could
the
note
of
knowles
be
detected
in
the
intricate
chorus
it
was
strange
knowles
had
been
the
high
priest
of
the
new
wyndham
worship
and
to
him
the
eminent
novelist
had
looked
for
sympathy
and
appreciation
but
knowles
had
made
no
sign
they
had
avoided
the
subject
whenever
they
met
wyndham
was
not
so
hardened
by
authorship
as
to
have
lost
the
instinctive
delicacy
felt
by
the
creator
at
the
birth
of
his
book
knowles
seemed
only
too
much
inclined
to
respect
that
delicacy
finally
wyndham
resolved
to
go
and
see
his
friend
alone
and
tentatively
sound
him
on
the
subject
of
laura
he
proposed
to
himself
a
pleasant
evening
chat
in
which
that
lady
would
be
discussed
in
all
her
bearings
and
he
would
enjoy
a
foretaste
of
the
praise
ere
long
to
be
dealt
out
to
him
before
an
admiring
public
on
his
way
to
knowles
rooms
he
heard
in
fancy
the
congratulation
the
temperate
flattery
the
fine
discriminating
phrase
he
found
knowles
amusing
himself
with
a
blue
pencil
and
miss
last
novel
laura
an
idyll
of
piccadilly
lay
on
the
table
beside
him
its
pages
cut
but
with
none
of
those
slips
of
paper
between
them
which
marked
the
other
books
put
aside
for
review
knowles
greeted
his
friend
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
and
they
fell
to
discussing
every
question
of
the
hour
except
the
burning
one
for
wyndham
by
the
rapidity
of
his
conversational
manoeuvres
it
was
evident
that
the
critic
wanted
to
steer
clear
of
that
topic
wyndham
however
after
ambling
round
and
round
it
for
some
time
with
no
effect
suddenly
brought
up
straight
in
front
of
it
with
have
you
condescended
to
read
my
last
what
the
mayfairy
tale
said
knowles
with
deft
pleasantry
yes
of
course
i
read
it
what
do
you
think
of
it
knowles
suddenly
looked
grave
well
at
the
moment
i
had
much
rather
not
tell
you
really
well
i
suppose
i
shall
know
some
day
knowles
looked
as
if
he
were
struggling
with
an
unpleasant
duty
and
it
were
getting
the
better
of
him
not
from
me
i
afraid
it
will
be
the
first
work
of
yours
i
have
left
unnoticed
as
i
ca
review
it
favourably
i
prefer
not
to
notice
it
at
all
you
surely
do
suppose
that
i
came
here
to
fish
for
a
review
i
do
not
thanks
i
do
deny
that
i
should
have
appreciated
the
public
expression
of
your
opinion
favourable
or
unfavourable
but
i
respect
your
scruples
as
far
as
i
understand
them
the
only
thing
is
he
paused
it
was
his
turn
to
feel
uncomfortable
is
what
well
after
the
way
you
delivered
yourself
on
my
other
books
which
are
feebleness
itself
compared
with
this
one
i
must
say
your
present
attitude
astonishes
me
i
given
you
my
reasons
for
it
no
that
what
you
not
done
surely
we
known
each
other
too
long
for
this
foolishness
of
course
it
considerate
of
you
not
to
damn
me
for
the
entertainment
of
the
british
public
but
you
know
you
the
only
man
in
england
whose
judgment
i
care
about
and
i
confess
i
like
to
have
your
private
opinion
the
usual
honest
and
candid
thing
you
know
i
not
talking
of
gods
men
and
columns
knowles
sat
silent
frowning
oh
well
of
course
if
you
rather
not
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
not
much
but
wyndham
palpitating
egoism
was
martyred
by
this
silence
beyond
endurance
and
he
burst
out
in
spite
of
himself
but
it
inconceivable
to
me
after
the
way
you
treated
my
first
crude
work
you
must
have
set
up
some
new
canons
of
art
since
then
otherwise
i
should
say
you
were
inconsistent
but
knowles
was
not
to
be
drawn
out
if
he
could
possibly
help
it
do
you
mind
telling
me
one
thing
have
you
anything
to
say
against
its
form
not
a
word
i
admit
that
in
form
it
about
as
perfect
as
it
well
could
be
i
er
he
was
beginning
to
feel
that
he
could
not
help
it
object
to
your
use
of
your
matter
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
i
mean
what
i
say
please
explain
very
well
since
you
so
earnestly
desire
my
honest
and
candid
opinion
you
shall
have
it
you
remind
me
that
i
praised
your
earlier
work
and
suggest
my
inconsistency
in
not
approving
of
your
latest
my
praise
was
sincere
i
thought
and
i
have
never
changed
my
opinion
that
the
originality
of
your
first
books
amounted
to
genius
your
last
however
great
its
other
qualities
has
not
that
merit
it
is
think
conspicuously
destitute
of
imagination
do
you
deny
its
vitality
its
faithfulness
to
nature
certainly
not
i
object
to
it
as
a
barefaced
plagiarism
from
nature
then
at
least
you
admit
that
my
heroine
lives
she
does
unfortunately
would
it
have
been
better
taste
to
wait
till
she
was
decently
dead
oh
i
see
you
mean
yes
i
mean
that
if
you
had
no
respect
for
your
own
reputation
you
might
have
thought
of
miss
craven
excuse
me
this
is
simply
irrelevant
nonsense
and
most
unworthy
of
you
miss
craven
as
you
perfectly
well
know
is
one
manifestation
of
the
eternal
flirt
i
seized
on
the
type
she
belongs
to
and
individualised
it
you
did
nothing
of
the
sort
you
seized
on
the
individual
and
put
her
into
type
a
very
different
thing
do
you
imagine
that
life
will
ever
be
the
same
to
that
poor
woman
again
i
never
liked
miss
craven
but
she
was
harmless
even
nice
before
you
got
hold
of
her
and
spoilt
her
by
making
her
think
herself
clever
is
that
what
happens
to
laura
that
among
other
things
other
things
also
slavishly
copied
from
miss
craven
i
recognise
the
faithfulness
of
your
portraiture
in
all
its
details
so
does
she
and
everybody
else
knowles
you
talk
like
the
lay
fool
surely
you
know
how
all
fiction
worthy
of
the
name
is
made
i
took
what
lay
nearest
at
hand
as
hundreds
of
novelists
have
done
before
me
though
as
for
that
not
an
incident
in
the
book
that
is
not
the
purest
fiction
you
give
me
credit
i
wo
say
for
originality
but
for
ordinary
reconstructive
ability
i
give
you
credit
for
having
made
the
most
of
quite
exceptional
advantages
you
best
know
how
you
obtained
them
wyndham
reflected
a
moment
then
looked
knowles
in
the
face
i
assure
you
solemnly
there
was
never
any
question
of
miss
honour
knowles
raised
his
eyebrows
i
did
suppose
for
a
moment
there
was
how
about
your
own
though
your
notions
of
honour
strike
me
as
being
quaintly
original
rather
more
original
than
your
piccadyllic
heroine
knowles
was
not
but
he
was
a
frequent
cause
of
bad
temper
in
other
people
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
wyndham
controlled
himself
for
a
final
effort
to
evade
the
personal
and
set
the
question
at
large
on
general
grounds
then
i
suppose
you
would
deny
the
right
of
any
artist
to
make
use
of
living
material
knowles
yawned
i
do
attempt
to
deny
anything
i
debating
another
question
what
is
that
wyndham
smiled
an
uneasy
muscular
smile
whether
it
is
my
duty
to
kick
you
or
rather
to
to
kick
you
out
of
this
room
really
and
what
for
for
the
crime
of
writing
a
successful
story
for
the
perpetration
of
the
most
consummate
piece
of
literary
scoundrelism
on
record
as
that
statement
was
accompanied
by
a
nervous
twitching
of
the
lips
which
wyndham
was
at
liberty
to
take
for
a
smile
he
held
out
his
hand
to
knowles
before
saying
my
dear
knowles
if
notions
of
literary
honour
held
good
there
would
be
an
end
of
realism
the
end
of
realism
my
dear
wyndham
is
the
thing
of
all
others
i
most
desire
to
see
they
had
shaken
hands
but
wyndham
understood
his
friend
and
he
knew
as
certainly
as
if
knowles
had
told
him
so
that
audrey
craven
the
woman
whom
neither
of
them
loved
had
avenged
herself
she
had
struck
through
laura
at
the
friendship
of
his
life
he
was
also
informed
of
one
or
two
facts
about
himself
which
had
not
as
yet
come
within
the
range
of
his
observation
he
consoled
himself
with
the
reflection
that
the
temptations
of
genius
are
not
those
of
other
men
and
perhaps
he
was
right
knowles
sat
down
to
his
review
of
miss
armstrong
book
with
unruffled
urbanity
he
wrote
this
authoress
belongs
to
a
select
but
rapidly
increasing
band
of
thinkers
there
may
be
schisms
in
the
new
school
with
regard
to
details
but
on
the
whole
it
is
a
united
one
the
members
are
unanimous
in
their
fearless
optimism
one
and
all
they
preach
the
same
hopeful
doctrine
that
the
attainment
of
a
high
standard
of
immodesty
by
woman
will
in
time
make
morality
possible
for
man
he
went
to
bed
vowing
that
of
all
professions
that
chosen
by
the
man
of
letters
is
the
most
detestable
chapter
xxii
that
winter
was
a
hard
one
for
the
havilands
they
were
at
the
very
lowest
ebb
of
their
resources
short
of
being
actually
in
debt
the
reclaiming
of
hardy
had
been
an
expensive
undertaking
for
katherine
in
more
ways
than
one
and
naturally
the
more
successful
her
efforts
were
the
more
time
they
consumed
she
had
been
so
busy
all
summer
finishing
off
old
work
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
take
up
anything
fresh
she
had
even
been
obliged
to
send
away
sitters
and
they
had
betaken
themselves
elsewhere
the
witch
had
not
sold
though
she
had
won
a
big
paragraph
all
to
herself
in
modern
art
in
her
first
enthusiasm
over
ted
success
katherine
had
encouraged
him
to
give
up
his
she
had
taken
over
some
of
his
work
herself
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
she
was
engaged
on
a
portrait
of
vincent
they
were
so
dependent
on
what
they
earned
that
these
serious
interruptions
to
work
threatened
an
inroad
on
their
small
capital
now
they
might
any
day
have
applied
to
pigott
for
a
loan
and
rejoiced
that
worthy
gentleman
heart
but
such
a
step
was
the
last
indignity
not
even
to
be
contemplated
by
ted
and
katherine
and
even
if
their
pride
had
not
stood
in
their
way
that
source
of
revenue
seemed
closed
to
them
now
ted
and
his
uncle
had
had
an
unfortunate
encounter
in
the
new
gallery
the
fact
that
he
was
indebted
to
katherine
for
an
invitation
to
the
private
view
had
not
prevented
pigott
from
speaking
his
mind
freely
to
her
brother
on
the
subject
of
the
witch
he
said
he
could
have
forgiven
ted
for
painting
such
a
picture
he
could
have
forgiven
katherine
too
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
ability
that
made
her
doubly
responsible
ted
tried
to
soothe
him
he
led
him
gently
away
from
the
spot
he
promised
to
do
all
he
could
to
induce
katherine
to
cultivate
the
grace
of
stupidity
but
it
was
useless
the
old
gentleman
stood
to
his
ground
and
ted
left
him
there
he
received
a
letter
from
him
the
next
morning
dear
edward
i
parted
from
you
yesterday
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
i
need
not
tell
you
how
deeply
shocked
and
grieved
i
was
to
learn
from
a
literary
young
friend
that
the
subject
of
your
picture
is
taken
from
the
works
of
the
atheist
shelley
a
man
whose
unprincipled
life
i
am
told
is
an
commentary
on
his
opinions
your
cousin
nettie
is
earning
a
modest
competence
by
and
the
painting
of
flowers
birds
and
other
innocent
and
beautiful
objects
why
can
not
katherine
do
the
same
when
she
is
willing
to
give
up
her
present
pursuits
for
some
becoming
occupation
let
her
be
assured
of
my
ready
encouragement
and
help
till
then
no
from
your
affectionate
uncle
james
pigott
pigott
had
written
his
last
sentence
advisedly
some
day
he
said
to
himself
those
young
people
will
have
to
put
their
pride
in
their
pocket
he
might
have
known
that
the
haviland
pride
was
not
of
the
kind
that
goes
conveniently
into
any
pocket
even
an
empty
one
but
katherine
worked
her
hardest
and
gave
little
heed
to
these
things
she
saw
her
own
chances
of
success
dwindling
farther
into
the
distance
and
was
surprised
to
see
how
little
she
cared
for
a
curious
callousness
had
come
over
her
of
late
selfish
ambition
selfish
because
it
often
persists
in
living
when
all
other
things
are
dead
seemed
to
have
died
in
her
at
last
had
she
overcome
it
or
was
it
that
she
had
really
ceased
to
care
she
had
too
much
to
think
of
to
be
able
to
settle
that
question
just
now
after
all
she
had
another
source
of
pride
vincent
had
begun
by
looking
to
her
as
a
protection
against
his
worst
self
and
when
his
mother
died
suddenly
that
winter
his
last
link
with
home
being
broken
he
became
more
and
more
dependent
on
katherine
and
now
though
the
tie
of
comradeship
between
them
was
closer
than
ever
he
had
no
longer
any
need
of
her
he
could
go
alone
his
will
was
free
his
intellect
was
awake
he
read
hard
now
all
his
old
ardours
and
enthusiasms
returned
to
him
he
worked
on
the
recasting
his
favourite
parts
beating
the
whole
into
shape
and
hunting
down
the
superfluous
adjective
with
a
manly
delight
in
the
new
sport
katherine
had
shown
the
revised
manuscript
to
knowles
and
he
had
found
her
a
publisher
and
worked
him
into
the
right
frame
of
mind
katherine
had
suppressed
part
of
that
publisher
verdict
it
was
to
the
effect
that
though
the
text
was
up
to
the
average
merit
of
its
kind
the
illustrations
would
form
the
most
valuable
portion
of
the
work
hardy
had
submitted
the
final
revision
of
his
proofs
to
katherine
but
on
one
point
he
was
resolute
i
want
the
dedication
to
stand
as
it
is
sis
and
katherine
nodded
her
head
and
was
silent
he
often
talked
about
audrey
now
he
was
no
longer
bitter
and
vindictive
as
he
had
been
in
the
days
of
his
degradation
his
old
feeling
for
her
had
returned
to
him
unchanged
except
for
the
refining
process
he
himself
had
undergone
his
love
was
ennobled
now
by
an
infinite
pity
not
that
he
had
lost
sight
of
what
she
had
done
for
him
but
now
that
his
eyes
were
clearer
he
saw
her
as
she
was
and
felt
to
the
full
the
pathos
of
her
vanity
wyndham
book
was
severely
criticised
in
devon
street
one
day
about
four
months
after
its
appearance
hardy
had
returned
to
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
and
was
discussing
it
with
katherine
as
he
sat
to
her
for
his
portrait
now
nearly
finished
he
had
just
pleasantly
told
her
that
he
wished
he
had
managed
to
fall
in
love
with
her
instead
of
with
audrey
she
would
have
made
something
very
different
of
him
a
remark
to
which
katherine
made
no
answer
treating
it
as
hardy
thought
with
the
contempt
it
deserved
then
he
broke
out
as
he
had
done
many
a
time
before
i
do
know
how
it
is
when
i
was
away
from
her
i
used
to
think
of
her
as
a
sort
of
amateur
angel
leading
me
on
katherine
smiled
it
was
very
evident
that
audrey
had
led
him
on
when
i
was
with
her
she
seemed
to
be
a
little
devil
encouraging
everything
that
was
bad
in
me
i
do
know
how
she
did
it
but
she
did
and
yet
kathy
whatever
they
may
say
i
do
believe
she
bad
i
do
swear
of
course
that
a
paragon
of
goodness
is
there
a
medium
but
she
was
a
sweet
little
thing
before
she
met
that
scoundrel
wyndham
was
she
but
katherine
was
giving
the
whole
of
her
attention
to
vincent
nose
putting
audrey
out
of
the
question
i
do
think
much
of
langley
wyndham
i
do
like
his
books
i
ca
breathe
in
his
stuffy
why
ca
the
fellow
open
his
windows
sometimes
and
let
in
a
little
of
god
fresh
air
as
you
know
i
believe
he
even
a
shadier
character
than
i
am
he
has
got
a
character
it
all
run
to
literature
h
i
not
so
sure
about
that
katherine
had
laid
down
her
brushes
and
was
examining
her
work
with
her
head
on
one
side
well
he
ca
draw
a
character
anyhow
simply
impossible
i
do
know
laura
is
audrey
and
audrey
a
funny
person
i
used
to
think
that
audrey
was
a
person
that
she
was
made
up
of
little
bits
of
people
stuck
together
that
not
bad
sis
she
made
up
of
bits
of
people
stuck
together
yes
but
the
thing
is
what
makes
them
stick
wyndham
does
go
into
that
and
audrey
his
work
is
clever
too
clever
by
half
but
it
terribly
superficial
hardy
meditated
on
that
saying
then
he
began
again
you
done
a
great
deal
for
me
kathy
i
sometimes
think
that
if
given
your
mind
to
it
you
could
have
made
something
of
audrey
you
know
poor
little
thing
she
used
to
think
she
was
very
but
she
was
more
easily
twisted
about
than
any
woman
i
know
that
what
made
her
so
fickle
if
there
any
truth
in
that
stupid
story
of
wyndham
she
must
have
been
like
a
piece
of
putty
in
her
hands
i
believe
if
you
could
have
got
hold
of
her
you
could
have
done
her
some
good
i
do
believe
in
doing
people
good
i
do
i
a
case
in
point
no
you
not
i
am
you
did
good
i
very
glad
to
hear
it
if
i
did
it
because
i
never
thought
about
it
now
if
i
tried
my
hand
on
audrey
i
should
set
to
work
with
the
fixed
intention
of
doing
her
good
therefore
i
should
fail
miserably
it
a
different
thing
altogether
i
see
no
difference
myself
katherine
was
silent
her
charity
had
covered
the
multitude
of
sins
why
had
she
not
been
able
to
spare
a
corner
of
it
for
audrey
come
said
hardy
it
not
as
if
she
was
really
very
bad
no
it
not
there
be
some
chance
then
there
is
a
medium
and
the
medium
is
hopeless
the
wonder
is
you
never
found
that
out
i
did
i
knew
it
all
the
time
yet
i
loved
her
it
made
no
difference
nothing
ever
will
i
tried
to
kill
my
feeling
for
her
but
it
no
use
i
ca
i
should
have
to
kill
myself
first
and
even
then
i
believe
i
should
find
it
waiting
for
me
in
hades
when
i
got
there
after
all
why
should
you
try
to
kill
it
vincent
it
the
shame
of
it
sis
katherine
might
have
thought
that
on
the
contrary
he
seemed
rather
proud
of
the
permanence
of
his
affections
but
she
was
too
much
preoccupied
to
be
aware
of
his
moral
absurdity
well
i
do
know
much
about
these
things
but
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if
she
does
love
you
even
if
she
is
everything
you
thought
she
was
there
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
loving
her
ah
kathy
you
never
loved
any
one
like
that
her
colour
changed
no
it
is
every
one
who
can
love
like
that
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
in
my
case
if
you
given
yourself
away
like
me
supposing
you
went
and
lost
your
little
heart
to
some
who
was
we
say
about
as
bad
a
lot
as
i
am
and
who
had
the
execrable
taste
not
to
care
a
rap
for
you
would
you
feel
ashamed
of
him
and
yourself
too
katherine
white
face
flushed
she
looked
away
from
him
and
answered
steadily
no
i
would
he
thought
he
had
hurt
her
feelings
and
was
about
to
change
the
subject
when
she
turned
a
beaming
face
to
him
but
then
you
see
i
do
love
anything
much
good
as
you
are
you
be
a
better
woman
if
you
did
of
course
there
are
exceptions
i
some
sort
of
affection
for
the
witch
and
ted
ted
is
a
very
fine
boy
and
the
witch
is
a
very
fine
picture
but
well
some
day
you
have
an
affection
for
something
else
it
wo
be
a
boy
and
it
wo
be
a
picture
then
sis
you
know
what
it
is
to
feel
and
your
art
will
go
pop
oh
i
hope
not
but
it
not
true
look
at
ted
ted
a
man
and
you
are
a
woman
ten
to
one
a
really
great
passion
improves
a
man
art
it
plays
the
deuce
with
a
woman
i
do
believe
it
said
katherine
with
rather
more
warmth
than
the
occasion
demanded
shall
i
tell
you
what
you
been
doing
sis
first
of
all
tried
to
live
two
lives
and
get
the
best
out
of
each
that
was
tempting
providence
as
rogers
would
say
you
found
that
would
work
so
you
said
to
yourself
give
it
up
here
goes
i
be
a
woman
at
all
costs
i
know
what
it
is
to
love
katherine
took
up
her
brushes
again
and
in
spite
of
herself
moved
one
foot
impatiently
hardy
went
on
well
pleased
with
his
own
lucidity
and
you
gave
up
the
only
thing
you
really
cared
about
and
played
at
being
the
slave
of
duty
the
devoted
sister
she
sighed
was
it
a
sigh
of
relief
you
wrong
i
anything
but
a
devoted
sister
yes
you
anything
but
a
devoted
sister
i
going
to
claim
one
of
the
privileges
of
friendship
that
of
speaking
unpleasant
truths
in
the
unpleasantest
way
possible
go
on
this
is
getting
interesting
i
repeat
then
you
not
a
truly
devoted
sister
a
truly
devoted
sister
would
give
her
brother
a
chance
of
developing
some
moral
fibre
on
his
own
account
ever
since
you
two
lived
together
you
been
making
noble
sacrifices
now
two
ca
play
at
that
game
and
the
boy
had
a
chance
the
consequence
is
he
wo
work
he
prefers
taking
it
easy
that
was
audrey
fault
not
mine
yes
but
you
encouraged
him
and
now
he
does
what
he
likes
young
monkey
and
you
do
all
the
and
you
making
yourself
ill
over
them
so
much
for
ted
i
given
him
a
hint
and
he
took
it
very
well
now
for
the
witch
i
believe
in
your
heart
of
hearts
you
love
her
better
than
everybody
else
put
together
and
now
you
off
on
the
other
tack
you
trying
to
sit
on
the
artist
in
you
that
you
may
develop
the
woman
i
mean
the
other
way
about
you
sitting
on
the
woman
that
you
may
develop
the
artist
are
you
getting
a
little
mixed
that
plan
works
worse
than
all
let
me
implore
you
not
to
go
on
with
it
if
you
only
knew
it
there
nothing
that
you
will
ever
do
lovelier
than
your
own
womanhood
whatever
you
do
do
kill
that
do
go
on
hardening
your
heart
to
everything
human
till
there
no
sweetness
left
in
your
nature
kathy
i
want
my
little
sister
to
make
the
best
of
her
life
some
day
some
good
man
will
ask
you
to
be
his
wife
if
when
that
day
comes
you
do
know
how
to
love
little
woman
all
the
success
in
the
world
wo
make
up
to
you
for
the
happiness
you
have
missed
oh
vincent
if
you
only
knew
how
funny
you
are
she
laughed
the
laugh
that
vincent
loved
to
hear
and
when
she
looked
at
him
her
eyelashes
were
all
wet
with
it
all
right
sis
some
day
you
own
that
your
elder
brother
was
such
a
fool
as
you
think
him
i
i
do
think
you
a
fool
i
only
wish
you
knew
how
frightfully
funny
you
are
no
i
do
though
she
added
below
her
breath
but
vincent
was
quite
unable
to
see
wherein
lay
the
humour
of
his
excellent
remarks
he
considered
that
his
experience
gave
him
a
right
to
speak
with
authority
on
questions
of
feeling
but
it
had
not
made
him
understand
everything
the
next
morning
katherine
was
sitting
before
her
easel
waiting
for
vincent
to
come
up
for
the
last
sitting
it
was
a
raw
cold
day
and
her
fingers
felt
numbed
as
they
took
up
the
brushes
ted
had
made
a
promise
to
hardy
to
do
his
fair
share
of
the
more
remunerative
work
before
keeping
it
he
was
giving
a
few
final
touches
to
one
of
the
figures
in
his
dante
study
of
paolo
and
francesca
swept
like
leaves
on
the
wind
of
hell
he
was
in
high
good
humour
and
as
he
worked
he
talked
incessantly
quoting
from
an
imaginary
review
in
the
genius
of
edward
haviland
we
have
a
new
avatar
of
the
spirit
of
art
haviland
is
the
disciple
of
no
school
he
owes
no
debt
either
to
the
past
or
to
the
present
he
works
in
a
noble
freedom
from
prejudice
and
preconception
uncorrupted
by
custom
as
he
is
untrammelled
by
tradition
if
we
may
classify
what
is
above
and
beyond
classification
we
should
say
that
in
matter
haviland
is
an
idealist
while
in
form
he
is
an
we
dare
to
prophesy
that
he
will
become
the
founder
of
a
new
school
in
the
near
future
oh
ted
do
be
quiet
and
let
me
think
for
a
minute
what
the
matter
kathy
i
do
know
i
think
i
tired
or
else
it
the
cold
ted
looked
at
her
earnestly
for
him
and
then
came
over
to
her
and
stroked
her
hair
there
something
wrong
wo
you
confide
in
your
brother
i
all
right
only
lazy
ca
ca
i
do
anything
well
perhaps
i
do
want
you
to
give
up
much
of
your
time
to
it
but
if
you
finish
some
of
those
things
i
do
feel
equal
to
tackling
them
all
oh
said
the
boy
turning
very
red
why
did
you
say
so
before
he
sat
down
and
began
at
once
on
the
pile
of
manuscripts
waiting
to
be
illustrated
but
he
continued
to
talk
i
saw
vincent
the
other
day
and
he
told
me
his
opinion
of
you
pretty
plainly
what
did
he
say
why
that
you
sacrificed
your
poor
brother
to
your
desire
to
cut
a
moral
figure
that
you
been
cultivating
all
sorts
of
extravagant
virtues
at
my
expense
i
might
have
been
playing
the
most
heroic
parts
and
getting
any
amount
of
applause
if
you
had
selfishly
bagged
all
the
best
ones
for
yourself
you
taken
up
the
whole
of
the
stage
so
that
i
have
had
room
even
to
exercise
the
minor
virtues
just
reach
me
that
sheaf
of
crayons
there
a
good
girl
thanks
ted
put
on
a
judical
air
and
chose
a
crayon
look
there
you
taken
the
most
uncomfortable
chair
and
the
worst
light
in
the
studio
when
i
might
have
been
posing
in
them
all
the
time
i
have
had
half
a
chance
vincent
said
so
no
wonder
he
disgusted
with
you
ah
that
not
so
bad
for
a
mere
tyro
no
kathy
he
quite
right
you
an
angel
and
i
been
a
lazy
scoundrel
but
you
admit
that
during
my
painful
mental
affliction
i
was
quite
responsible
and
afterwards
well
how
was
i
to
know
i
thought
we
were
getting
on
very
nicely
so
we
were
ted
up
till
now
her
last
words
were
so
charged
with
feeling
that
ted
looked
up
surprised
but
he
said
nothing
being
a
person
of
tact
the
sitting
that
morning
was
not
a
long
one
hardy
seemed
tired
and
depressed
after
posing
patiently
for
half
an
hour
he
gave
it
up
it
no
good
this
morning
i
must
go
out
and
get
a
little
warmth
into
me
you
people
had
better
come
too
it
such
a
horrid
day
pleaded
katherine
you
get
exceedingly
wet
and
come
back
no
warmer
it
going
to
rain
or
snow
or
something
as
she
spoke
the
first
drops
of
a
cold
sleet
rattled
on
the
skylight
but
vincent
was
obstinate
and
restless
i
must
go
if
it
only
for
a
turn
on
the
embankment
what
with
my
book
and
your
picture
i
have
stretched
my
legs
all
week
come
along
ted
you
die
kathy
if
you
persist
in
wallowing
in
like
that
and
taking
no
exercise
they
set
out
before
a
cutting
and
a
sharp
shower
of
rain
that
froze
as
it
fell
katherine
watched
them
as
they
crossed
the
street
and
turned
on
to
the
embankment
the
wind
came
round
the
corner
as
a
will
and
through
the
chilling
her
as
she
stood
there
nobody
more
surprised
than
myself
she
said
and
yet
i
might
have
known
that
if
i
went
in
for
this
sort
of
thing
i
should
make
a
mess
of
it
she
went
back
to
the
fire
and
settled
herself
in
the
attitude
of
thought
there
was
no
end
to
her
thinking
now
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
why
she
was
always
tired
hitherto
she
had
triumphed
over
fatigue
and
privation
by
a
power
which
seemed
inexhaustible
and
was
certainly
mysterious
much
of
it
was
due
to
sheer
youth
and
health
and
to
the
exercise
which
gave
her
a
steady
hand
and
a
cool
head
much
doubtless
to
her
unflinching
will
but
katherine
was
hardly
aware
how
far
her
strength
had
lain
in
the
absence
of
temptation
to
any
feminine
weakness
hitherto
she
had
seen
her
object
always
in
a
clear
untroubled
air
and
her
work
had
gained
something
of
her
life
austere
and
passionless
serenity
now
it
was
all
different
and
she
was
thinking
of
what
had
made
that
difference
ted
came
back
glowing
from
his
walk
but
vincent
was
colder
than
ever
he
sat
shivering
over
the
havilands
fire
all
afternoon
and
went
to
bed
early
we
finish
that
sitting
sis
he
said
wearily
ted
went
out
again
to
dine
with
knowles
and
katherine
was
left
alone
it
might
have
been
her
own
mood
or
the
shadow
of
vincent
but
she
was
depressed
with
vague
presentiments
of
trouble
they
gathered
like
the
formless
winter
clouds
without
falling
in
any
rain
then
she
realised
that
she
was
very
tired
she
wrapped
herself
in
a
rug
and
lay
down
on
the
couch
to
rest
and
rest
came
as
it
comes
after
a
sleepless
night
not
in
sleep
deep
and
restorative
but
in
a
gentle
numbing
of
the
brain
she
woke
out
of
her
stupor
refreshed
the
cloud
had
rolled
away
and
she
could
work
again
she
sat
down
to
the
last
pile
of
vincent
proofs
when
she
had
finished
them
she
turned
over
the
pages
again
the
reading
had
brought
back
to
her
the
last
eighteen
months
with
all
the
meaning
that
they
had
for
her
now
she
looked
back
and
thought
of
the
years
when
she
had
first
worked
for
ted
of
the
precious
time
that
audrey
had
wasted
the
fatalism
that
was
her
mood
so
often
now
told
her
that
these
things
to
and
it
was
better
infinitely
better
for
ted
to
have
had
that
experience
she
looked
back
on
the
year
that
vincent
had
wasted
out
of
his
own
life
and
saw
that
that
too
had
to
be
there
had
been
vicarious
salvation
even
there
ted
had
once
told
her
that
there
was
a
time
when
as
he
expressed
it
he
would
have
walked
calmly
to
perdition
if
vincent
had
not
gone
before
him
and
shown
him
what
was
there
she
looked
back
on
that
year
of
her
own
life
wasted
as
she
had
once
thought
the
year
she
had
given
up
so
grudgingly
at
the
beginning
so
freely
at
the
end
and
she
was
content
and
now
she
was
giving
up
not
time
alone
and
thought
and
labour
but
love
love
that
could
have
no
certain
reward
but
pain
and
she
was
still
content
at
first
she
had
been
astonished
and
indignant
at
her
own
capacity
for
emotion
it
was
as
if
her
nature
had
suddenly
revealed
itself
in
a
new
and
unpleasant
light
then
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
it
yesterday
she
was
even
amused
at
the
strangeness
and
the
fatuity
of
it
all
she
described
herself
as
a
bungling
amateur
wandering
out
of
her
own
line
and
attempting
the
impossible
clearly
she
should
have
left
this
sort
of
thing
to
people
like
audrey
to
whose
genius
it
was
suited
and
who
might
hope
to
attain
some
success
in
it
but
for
her
the
love
of
art
was
quite
incompatible
with
the
art
of
love
she
could
have
imagined
herself
entertaining
these
feelings
for
some
one
like
percival
knowles
for
instance
who
was
clever
and
had
an
educated
sense
of
humour
who
wrote
verses
for
her
and
flattered
her
artistic
vanity
but
to
have
fixed
upon
vincent
of
all
people
in
the
world
she
must
have
done
it
because
it
was
impossible
that
was
what
she
had
said
yesterday
but
she
understood
had
she
not
helped
to
make
vincent
a
man
that
she
could
love
without
shame
he
was
the
work
of
her
hands
that
which
her
own
fingers
had
made
it
was
natural
that
she
should
love
her
own
work
was
she
not
an
artist
before
everything
as
he
had
said
her
tears
came
and
after
her
tears
a
calm
in
which
she
heard
the
beating
of
a
heart
that
was
not
her
own
and
felt
the
pulse
of
the
divine
fate
that
moves
through
human
things
then
she
asked
herself
was
vincent
right
what
effect
had
this
curious
experience
really
had
on
her
painting
she
felt
no
personal
interest
in
the
answer
but
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
easel
her
portrait
of
vincent
was
finished
all
but
the
right
hand
that
was
still
in
outline
it
was
strange
ted
best
work
had
begun
with
his
head
of
audrey
what
about
her
own
she
saw
through
her
tears
that
in
all
her
long
and
hateful
apprenticeship
to
nothing
that
she
had
ever
done
could
compare
with
this
last
there
was
a
new
quality
in
it
something
that
she
had
once
despaired
of
attaining
and
that
was
character
she
had
painted
the
man
himself
as
she
saw
him
not
the
vincent
of
any
particular
hour
but
vincent
with
the
memory
of
the
past
and
the
hope
of
the
future
in
his
face
all
the
infinite
suggestion
and
pathos
the
complex
expression
that
life
had
left
on
it
was
there
if
she
had
not
loved
vincent
loved
him
not
only
as
he
was
but
as
he
might
have
been
would
she
have
known
how
to
paint
like
that
although
her
womanhood
would
never
receive
the
full
reward
of
its
devotion
that
debt
had
been
paid
back
to
her
art
with
interest
the
artistic
voice
told
her
that
vincent
was
wrong
that
for
her
what
women
call
love
had
meant
knowledge
that
her
strength
would
henceforth
lie
in
the
visible
rendering
of
character
and
that
work
of
such
a
high
order
would
command
immediate
success
and
the
voice
of
her
womanhood
cried
out
in
anguish
all
the
success
in
the
world
wo
make
up
to
you
for
the
happiness
you
have
missed
there
was
no
sitting
the
next
day
for
vincent
was
in
bed
ill
with
congestion
of
the
lungs
chapter
xxiii
there
is
a
little
village
in
north
devon
sheltered
from
the
sea
by
a
low
range
of
that
stretches
for
miles
on
each
side
of
it
the
coast
turns
westward
here
and
no
cliff
breaks
that
line
of
billowy
sand
northward
and
southward
it
goes
with
the
rhythmic
monotony
of
the
sea
the
are
dotted
with
tufts
of
the
long
where
the
rabbits
sit
inland
they
are
covered
with
fine
blades
bitten
short
by
the
sheep
seaward
lies
the
hard
ribbed
sand
glistening
with
salt
and
fringed
with
the
white
surf
of
the
atlantic
on
the
coast
about
a
mile
from
the
village
there
is
a
long
bungalow
built
on
the
the
sand
is
in
the
garden
where
no
flowers
grow
but
and
the
wild
it
lies
in
drifts
about
the
verandah
and
is
whirled
by
the
atlantic
storms
on
to
the
low
thatched
roof
the
house
stands
alone
but
for
a
few
fishermen
huts
beside
it
huddled
close
together
for
neighbourhood
here
because
it
was
the
most
spot
she
knew
audrey
had
come
exchanging
the
roar
of
london
for
the
roar
of
the
atlantic
she
thought
she
would
find
consolation
in
the
presence
of
nature
london
had
become
intolerable
to
her
everywhere
she
turned
she
was
reminded
of
the
hateful
laura
laura
stood
open
in
the
window
of
every
laura
lay
on
every
table
there
was
no
getting
away
from
her
and
yet
audrey
notoriety
had
won
her
more
friends
than
she
had
ever
had
before
everywhere
people
were
kind
to
her
they
made
much
of
her
they
said
it
was
hard
lines
it
was
a
shame
execrable
unpardonable
and
they
assured
her
that
nobody
thought
a
bit
the
worse
of
her
for
all
that
some
even
went
so
far
as
to
declare
that
they
saw
not
the
remotest
resemblance
between
her
and
the
popular
heroine
but
it
was
no
use
nothing
could
raise
her
in
her
own
esteem
she
fled
she
longed
to
be
alone
with
nature
she
took
the
bungalow
for
the
winter
and
once
there
she
wished
she
had
never
come
she
arrived
in
a
storm
that
lasted
some
days
she
thought
she
would
have
gone
mad
simply
with
hearing
the
mad
wind
and
sea
it
was
the
same
whether
she
sat
indoors
listening
to
them
or
she
walked
out
battling
with
the
wreaths
of
whirling
sand
after
the
storm
came
the
dull
grey
heaving
calm
always
the
rolling
clouds
the
rolling
and
the
rolling
sea
that
was
infinitely
worse
and
to
add
to
her
depression
audrey
had
never
been
so
rigidly
confined
to
the
society
of
her
chaperon
there
was
nobody
else
to
see
or
hear
and
the
boundaries
of
the
poor
lady
intellect
were
conspicuous
in
the
melancholy
waste
there
was
no
escape
from
her
except
into
the
cold
monotony
without
then
february
set
in
warm
though
grey
one
morning
audrey
was
able
to
sit
out
in
a
sunny
hollow
of
the
where
the
rabbits
had
flattened
a
nest
for
her
then
she
could
think
she
was
in
the
presence
of
nature
art
was
nothing
to
this
art
in
the
time
of
her
brief
acquaintance
with
it
had
baffled
her
and
given
her
a
hint
of
her
own
feebleness
but
nature
was
the
great
incomprehensible
and
she
was
alone
with
it
alone
in
a
lonely
land
peopled
mostly
by
the
wild
creatures
of
sea
and
shore
by
peasants
and
fishermen
men
and
women
who
looked
at
her
with
strange
eyes
and
spoke
a
strange
language
whose
ways
were
dark
to
her
and
their
thoughts
unfathomable
she
was
face
to
face
not
only
with
primitive
human
beings
but
with
the
primeval
forces
of
the
world
the
stern
implacable
will
of
the
wind
and
sea
not
that
she
could
feel
these
things
thus
for
they
lay
beyond
the
range
of
her
emotions
but
at
the
same
time
they
tortured
her
at
first
it
was
only
by
a
dull
sense
of
their
presence
annihilating
her
own
then
because
they
were
things
too
great
for
her
to
grasp
they
cruelly
flung
her
back
upon
herself
they
had
no
revelation
for
her
but
left
to
herself
bit
by
bit
her
own
character
was
revealed
to
her
not
as
it
had
appeared
to
her
before
not
even
as
wyndham
had
revealed
it
to
her
but
in
the
nothingness
that
was
its
being
it
was
stripped
bare
of
all
that
had
clothed
it
and
ruled
it
and
made
it
seem
beautiful
in
her
eyes
left
to
herself
all
the
influences
that
had
lent
colour
and
consistency
to
this
blank
unstable
nature
had
passed
out
of
her
life
the
men
whose
destiny
she
had
tried
to
mould
who
had
ended
by
moulding
hers
twisting
it
now
into
one
shape
now
into
another
had
done
with
it
at
last
they
had
flung
it
from
them
unshapen
as
before
there
was
no
permanence
even
in
destiny
vincent
whose
will
had
dominated
her
own
ted
whose
boyish
passion
had
touched
her
heart
and
made
her
feel
langley
whose
intellect
had
kindled
hers
and
made
her
able
to
think
they
were
all
gone
and
she
was
alone
that
was
langley
doing
langley
whom
alone
of
the
three
she
had
really
loved
ah
she
hated
him
for
it
now
and
hating
him
she
remembered
the
many
virtues
of
the
two
whom
she
had
not
loved
well
vincent
that
was
a
revelation
of
love
why
had
she
shut
her
eyes
to
it
ted
too
poor
boy
he
might
have
been
hers
still
if
she
had
chosen
she
might
have
been
moulding
his
destiny
at
this
moment
instead
of
which
his
destiny
was
doubtless
moulding
itself
admirably
without
her
then
her
mood
changed
she
revolted
against
the
cruelty
of
her
lot
her
sex
was
the
original
the
unpardonable
injustice
if
she
had
only
been
a
man
she
could
have
taken
her
life
into
her
own
hands
and
shaped
it
according
to
her
will
but
woman
even
modern
woman
is
the
slave
of
circumstances
and
the
fool
of
fate
audrey
audrey
my
dear
called
a
voice
across
the
solitude
had
frightened
miss
craven
out
of
the
bungalow
and
she
was
picking
her
way
in
and
out
among
the
rabbit
holes
north
devon
was
hateful
to
cousin
bella
she
hated
the
wastes
of
sand
and
sea
the
discomforts
of
the
bungalow
the
slow
hours
uncertainly
measured
by
that
seemed
as
if
they
would
never
come
her
brain
was
wild
with
unsatisfied
curiosity
yet
she
had
tact
in
the
presence
of
real
suffering
she
had
forborne
to
question
audrey
about
the
past
and
their
present
life
was
not
fruitful
in
topics
she
did
nothing
but
wonder
i
wonder
when
it
will
be
i
wonder
if
there
was
anything
between
audrey
and
her
cousin
i
wonder
which
of
those
three
gentlemen
it
was
i
wonder
when
it
will
be
that
was
the
monotonous
rondo
of
her
thoughts
to
which
the
sea
kept
time
audrey
my
dear
come
in
i
think
it
must
be
she
wailed
but
no
answer
came
from
the
hollow
she
meekly
turned
and
picked
her
way
back
again
across
the
audrey
lay
hidden
till
the
forlorn
little
figure
was
out
of
sight
then
she
got
up
and
looked
around
her
she
shuddered
her
life
was
as
bleak
as
the
bleak
landscape
smitten
by
the
salt
wind
cold
and
grey
and
formless
as
the
winter
sea
what
was
that
black
silhouette
on
the
sands
she
strained
her
eyes
to
see
another
figure
was
making
its
way
towards
her
from
the
bungalow
when
it
came
near
she
recognised
the
unofficial
rustic
who
brought
telegrams
from
the
nearest
she
waited
the
man
approached
her
with
an
inane
smile
on
his
face
teleegram
vur
yü
mizz
he
drawled
she
tore
open
the
cover
and
read
come
at
once
vincent
dying
wire
what
train
you
come
katherine
she
crumpled
the
paper
in
her
clenched
hand
the
landscape
was
blotted
out
she
saw
nothing
but
the
envelope
lying
at
her
feet
a
dull
orange
patch
against
the
greyish
sand
any
awnzur
mizz
no
she
shut
her
eyes
and
tried
to
realise
it
yes
yes
there
is
wait
i
must
look
out
my
trains
first
she
made
out
that
by
driving
to
barnstaple
and
catching
the
train
she
would
reach
waterloo
about
eight
she
sent
the
man
back
with
a
telegram
saying
that
she
would
be
in
devon
street
by
nine
that
evening
at
the
latest
it
was
past
one
then
and
she
had
yet
to
pack
it
was
hopeless
she
could
never
catch
that
train
it
did
not
matter
there
was
another
to
paddington
an
hour
later
it
was
a
slow
train
but
she
would
be
with
vincent
by
eleven
but
she
was
faint
and
had
to
have
some
luncheon
before
she
could
do
anything
and
there
was
so
much
to
do
she
flew
hither
and
thither
trying
to
collect
her
clothes
and
her
thoughts
her
grey
cloak
and
her
bearskins
she
would
want
them
it
would
be
cold
in
the
train
and
her
best
hat
where
was
her
best
hat
cousin
bella
had
hidden
her
best
hat
ah
she
think
or
everything
would
go
wrong
what
was
it
all
about
vincent
dying
dying
audrey
knew
little
about
dying
except
that
it
was
a
habit
people
had
of
plunging
you
suddenly
into
mourning
when
you
had
just
ordered
a
new
dress
death
was
another
of
those
things
she
could
not
understand
by
the
time
she
had
had
luncheon
and
decided
what
clothes
she
would
take
and
packed
them
by
the
time
the
one
old
fly
in
the
village
had
been
ordered
and
had
made
its
way
at
a
funereal
pace
to
barnstaple
audrey
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
train
steaming
out
of
the
station
by
taking
the
next
train
and
travelling
all
night
she
would
only
reach
paddington
at
four
in
the
morning
as
she
was
at
last
borne
on
towards
london
lying
back
on
the
cushions
and
trying
to
sleep
the
facts
became
more
clear
to
her
vincent
was
dying
and
he
had
sent
for
her
she
was
exalted
once
more
in
her
own
eyes
it
seemed
to
her
then
that
her
love
for
vincent
had
been
the
one
stable
and
enduring
thing
in
her
nature
the
link
that
bound
her
to
a
transfigured
past
that
gave
coherence
to
a
life
of
episodes
chapter
xxiv
vincent
had
been
ill
for
six
weeks
before
katherine
sent
off
her
telegram
for
a
month
of
that
time
he
had
been
struggling
with
death
then
when
the
mild
weather
set
in
he
had
taken
a
sudden
turn
for
the
better
and
it
seemed
to
himself
and
the
havilands
that
he
had
won
the
victory
only
the
doctor
and
rogers
looked
grave
the
doctor
because
of
his
science
which
taught
him
to
be
cautious
in
raising
people
hopes
rogers
because
of
a
deep
theological
pessimism
she
unburdened
herself
to
katherine
i
knew
it
be
when
gave
up
them
of
miss
been
as
good
as
gold
for
the
last
year
given
me
no
trouble
nor
anybody
a
goin
about
so
soft
and
bilin
of
corffee
in
little
hetna
i
said
to
then
going
to
be
took
it
was
the
same
with
my
pore
miss
do
talk
nonsense
rogers
hardy
has
the
least
intention
of
dying
he
getting
better
as
fast
as
ever
he
can
oh
miss
do
you
sy
so
it
gives
me
a
turn
to
anybody
talk
so
presumptuous
do
you
do
it
m
if
is
a
little
better
it
enuff
to
make
the
almighty
tyke
jest
to
you
miss
katherine
forgave
rogers
for
the
affectionate
woman
had
helped
to
nurse
vincent
with
a
zeal
out
of
all
proportion
to
her
knowledge
katherine
had
engaged
a
during
the
crisis
of
his
illness
after
that
she
and
ted
nursed
him
themselves
by
turns
one
sitting
up
all
night
while
the
other
slept
on
a
bed
made
up
in
the
to
be
within
call
katherine
learned
to
know
ted
better
in
those
six
weeks
than
in
all
his
life
before
the
boy
seemed
to
be
possessed
by
a
passion
of
remorse
he
was
as
quiet
as
katherine
in
vincent
room
and
could
do
anything
that
had
to
be
done
there
with
the
gentleness
and
devotion
of
a
woman
she
would
willingly
have
kept
on
the
trained
nurse
in
order
to
give
vincent
every
advantage
in
the
fight
for
recovery
but
it
was
impossible
for
all
three
of
them
had
come
to
the
end
of
their
resources
at
the
same
time
the
havilands
were
in
debt
at
last
vincent
had
sunk
nearly
all
his
capital
in
his
british
columbian
farm
where
the
agent
in
whose
integrity
he
had
guilelessly
trusted
worked
the
land
for
his
own
benefit
and
cheated
him
out
of
the
returns
his
mother
had
left
everything
to
her
second
husband
worse
than
all
was
the
reprehensible
conduct
of
sir
theophilus
parker
the
old
gentleman
had
died
well
within
the
term
his
nephew
had
given
him
but
had
made
no
mention
of
him
in
his
will
and
lavernac
and
three
thousand
went
to
a
kinsman
of
irreproachable
morals
but
a
radical
and
many
degrees
more
distant
than
vincent
from
the
blood
of
a
tory
squire
so
after
the
struggle
with
death
came
the
struggle
with
poverty
work
was
impossible
for
hands
busy
with
service
in
the
and
young
brains
worn
out
with
watching
and
anxiety
the
most
expensive
luxuries
were
poor
vincent
necessities
for
everything
depended
now
on
keeping
up
his
strength
one
morning
after
a
long
night
watching
instead
of
turning
into
the
next
room
to
sleep
katherine
put
on
her
hat
and
cloak
and
went
up
to
the
deserted
studio
she
left
the
house
with
the
witch
of
atlas
under
her
cloak
and
carried
her
to
every
in
piccadilly
and
new
bond
street
it
was
all
in
vain
everywhere
the
witch
was
pronounced
to
be
beautiful
but
unsalable
she
was
bowed
out
of
every
with
polite
regret
expressed
in
one
formula
the
demand
for
this
kind
of
work
is
really
so
small
that
we
could
only
offer
you
a
nominal
sum
madam
finally
katherine
turned
into
a
small
shop
in
westminster
only
to
receive
the
same
answer
but
this
time
she
was
desperate
what
do
you
call
a
nominal
sum
the
dealer
looked
the
picture
up
and
down
he
noted
too
the
shabby
cloak
and
worn
face
of
the
artist
frame
included
five
guineas
not
a
shilling
more
miss
i
take
that
she
said
almost
greedily
and
the
witch
was
handed
over
the
counter
in
exchange
for
the
tenth
part
of
her
value
but
five
guineas
were
a
mere
drop
in
the
ocean
of
their
necessities
two
days
later
katherine
set
out
again
no
longer
alert
and
eager
but
with
a
white
face
a
firm
mouth
and
a
bearing
so
emphatically
resolute
that
it
suggested
a
previous
agony
of
indecision
she
took
a
from
lupus
street
to
the
city
getting
out
at
leadenhall
street
she
walked
on
till
she
came
to
a
building
where
an
arrow
painted
on
the
doorway
guided
her
to
the
offices
of
pigott
on
the
third
floor
on
and
on
she
went
up
the
broad
stone
stairs
with
a
sick
heart
and
trembling
knees
the
steepest
weariest
climb
she
had
ever
made
in
a
life
of
climbing
when
she
reached
the
third
floor
she
almost
turned
back
at
the
sight
of
the
closed
door
marked
private
then
the
thought
of
vincent
lying
in
his
wretched
room
a
sudden
blinding
vision
of
his
white
face
laid
back
on
the
pillows
overcame
the
last
rebellion
of
her
pride
she
knocked
a
voice
answered
who
is
there
she
brushed
her
eyelashes
with
her
hand
and
walked
in
it
me
uncle
pigott
almost
started
from
his
seat
you
katherine
bless
me
dear
me
dear
me
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
examined
her
as
if
she
had
been
some
curious
animal
and
he
too
noticed
not
only
her
frayed
skirt
and
the
worn
edges
of
the
fur
about
her
cloak
but
the
sharp
lines
of
her
face
and
the
black
shadows
under
her
eyes
sit
down
my
dear
she
obeyed
putting
her
elbow
on
the
office
table
and
resting
her
head
in
her
hand
she
looked
defiantly
almost
fiercely
before
her
and
spoke
in
a
cold
hard
voice
i
come
to
ask
you
if
you
lend
us
some
money
we
in
debt
in
debt
that
bad
i
know
it
is
but
we
had
illness
in
the
house
and
expenses
that
we
had
to
meet
bless
me
is
the
boy
ill
no
it
not
ted
but
as
she
tried
to
explain
who
it
was
she
broke
down
utterly
and
burst
into
tears
then
uncle
james
took
off
his
spectacles
and
wiped
them
he
waited
till
she
could
speak
coherently
and
when
he
had
heard
he
took
his
out
of
his
drawer
asking
no
questions
and
making
no
comments
for
which
katherine
respected
him
how
much
will
clear
you
katherine
and
see
you
to
the
end
of
this
business
twenty
pounds
would
clear
us
but
uncle
james
looked
very
grave
and
he
wrote
with
a
slow
and
terrible
deliberation
but
he
smiled
lavishly
as
he
handed
her
a
cheque
for
a
hundred
guineas
he
had
made
it
guineas
remember
there
plenty
more
where
that
came
from
i
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
uncle
we
repay
it
gradually
with
the
interest
interest
indeed
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
and
we
wo
say
anything
about
repayment
either
this
time
only
keep
out
of
debt
keep
out
of
debt
and
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
katherine
katherine
hesitated
and
her
voice
trembled
i
i
not
no
i
do
say
you
are
i
ask
no
questions
and
katherine
he
looked
up
but
she
was
still
standing
beside
him
yes
always
come
to
me
at
once
when
you
want
money
and
go
to
your
aunt
kate
when
you
want
advice
she
help
you
better
than
i
can
my
dear
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
indeed
you
are
too
good
to
me
she
stooped
down
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
pressing
his
hand
in
hers
and
was
gone
before
he
could
see
her
tears
perhaps
they
would
have
gratified
him
but
he
was
amply
rewarded
by
her
kiss
and
the
compliment
paid
him
by
his
own
conscience
which
told
him
that
he
had
not
forced
his
niece
confidence
as
he
might
have
done
nor
yet
chuckled
as
he
might
have
done
over
her
fallen
pride
it
was
a
remarkable
fulfilment
of
prophecy
too
when
she
got
back
to
devon
street
vincent
was
asleep
with
rogers
watching
over
him
and
ted
was
waiting
for
her
to
come
to
lunch
he
looked
terribly
depressed
she
showed
him
her
cheque
in
silence
you
never
asked
that
stern
old
puritan
father
do
ted
yes
i
did
i
thought
it
would
kill
me
but
it
did
oh
ted
we
done
him
an
injustice
he
was
kindness
itself
i
had
to
tell
him
about
vincent
too
and
he
never
said
a
word
only
gave
me
the
cheque
and
said
we
were
to
pay
it
back
h
that
was
half
bad
of
him
poor
old
thing
that
admission
meant
a
great
deal
from
ted
there
a
letter
there
for
you
from
knowles
i
think
what
he
writing
about
she
tore
open
the
envelope
to
her
intense
surprise
she
found
a
cheque
for
fifty
guineas
in
it
and
this
note
dear
miss
haviland
forgive
my
saying
so
but
when
you
want
to
sell
your
pictures
why
do
you
consult
your
friends
instead
of
going
to
a
thieving
dealer
i
found
the
witch
in
the
hands
of
such
an
one
and
rescued
her
for
i
wo
say
how
little
as
i
could
not
possibly
keep
my
gains
on
any
other
terms
please
accept
the
enclosed
which
with
what
you
probably
received
will
make
up
something
like
her
real
value
i
need
not
tell
you
how
delighted
i
am
to
possess
so
exquisite
a
specimen
of
your
best
work
ted
what
am
i
to
do
send
it
back
again
no
you
little
fool
keep
it
and
never
do
again
for
any
one
for
any
one
what
was
there
that
she
would
not
do
for
vincent
but
ted
having
said
that
looked
more
depressed
than
ever
he
went
to
the
fireplace
and
leaned
against
the
chimneypiece
shading
his
face
with
his
hand
what
is
it
ted
he
made
no
answer
a
terrible
fear
clutched
at
her
heart
and
he
saw
it
in
her
eyes
he
all
right
now
he
sleeping
but
but
tell
me
ted
well
crashawe
was
here
this
morning
and
he
says
he
is
really
better
but
he
better
he
said
so
himself
when
he
examined
him
yesterday
yes
so
he
is
in
a
way
that
is
you
see
his
lungs
are
all
right
it
his
heart
that
bad
now
crashawe
says
it
must
always
have
been
more
or
less
weak
and
now
he
stopped
short
ted
she
implored
it
may
stop
beating
any
minute
she
said
nothing
she
only
took
off
her
hat
and
cloak
and
put
on
her
artist
overall
it
was
her
nurse
apron
now
she
must
go
to
vincent
but
a
thought
struck
her
before
she
reached
the
door
does
he
know
no
but
i
think
he
has
some
idea
he
told
crashawe
this
morning
not
to
interfere
with
the
course
of
nature
ted
smiled
a
dreary
smile
at
the
recollection
katherine
dismissed
rogers
and
took
up
her
post
at
bedside
he
was
still
sleeping
with
his
face
turned
towards
hers
as
she
sat
and
as
she
looked
at
him
she
had
hope
she
was
still
young
and
it
was
inconceivable
to
her
that
anything
she
loved
so
much
should
die
it
was
not
she
pleaded
as
if
she
had
been
happy
as
if
her
love
had
any
chance
of
a
return
or
had
asked
for
anything
better
than
to
spend
itself
like
this
continually
and
as
she
sat
on
watching
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
better
as
it
was
better
that
love
should
live
by
immortal
things
by
things
intangible
invisible
by
pity
by
faith
by
hope
breaking
little
by
little
every
link
with
earth
she
tried
to
make
herself
believe
this
pleasant
theory
as
she
had
tried
many
a
day
and
many
a
night
before
her
heart
having
nothing
else
to
warm
it
but
the
fire
of
its
own
sacrifice
it
was
better
as
it
was
and
yet
she
said
again
in
this
last
six
weeks
he
had
been
hers
in
a
way
in
which
he
could
be
no
other
woman
not
even
audrey
he
was
hers
by
her
days
of
service
her
nights
of
watching
by
all
that
had
gone
before
by
her
part
in
his
new
life
after
all
that
could
never
be
undone
she
was
almost
happy
ted
took
her
place
for
an
hour
in
the
evening
but
that
was
all
the
rest
she
gave
herself
she
meant
to
sit
up
with
vincent
again
do
you
know
kathy
your
eyes
are
very
pretty
it
had
struck
midnight
and
vincent
had
been
awake
and
looking
at
her
for
the
last
two
minutes
she
smiled
and
blushed
and
that
made
her
whole
face
look
pretty
too
and
as
he
looked
into
her
eyes
the
blindness
fell
from
his
own
and
he
saw
as
a
dying
man
sometimes
does
see
come
here
sis
he
stretched
out
his
arm
on
the
counterpane
and
as
she
knelt
beside
him
he
put
back
her
hair
from
her
forehead
i
wonder
if
i
was
wrong
when
i
thought
you
could
love
anybody
then
she
knew
that
he
was
dying
yes
very
wrong
indeed
for
i
loved
you
then
vincent
her
face
was
transfigured
as
she
spoke
he
had
to
be
spared
all
sudden
emotions
but
she
knew
that
confession
would
do
him
no
harm
and
indeed
he
took
it
quite
calmly
without
the
least
change
of
pulse
i
not
ungrateful
there
nothing
to
be
grateful
for
i
could
help
it
i
would
have
loved
you
more
kathy
if
it
had
been
for
audrey
he
spoke
without
emotion
in
the
tone
of
a
man
stating
a
simple
matter
of
fact
then
he
remarked
in
the
same
voice
that
as
it
happened
he
was
dying
so
it
made
no
difference
perhaps
he
wanted
her
to
know
that
a
grave
was
ready
for
the
secret
she
had
just
told
him
there
was
no
need
to
remind
her
of
that
she
was
sure
of
it
before
she
spoke
her
kneeling
attitude
and
hands
outstretched
on
the
counterpane
suggested
an
order
of
ideas
that
had
never
been
very
far
from
him
during
his
illness
for
vincent
had
been
wide
awake
and
thinking
difficult
thoughts
many
a
time
when
he
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
and
katherine
had
thought
he
was
asleep
i
want
you
to
read
to
me
he
said
at
last
what
would
you
like
well
the
new
testament
i
think
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
she
rose
from
her
knees
and
looked
helplessly
round
the
room
there
was
a
bible
somewhere
upstairs
but
you
find
one
in
the
drawer
there
where
my
handkerchiefs
are
she
looked
rummaging
gently
among
his
poor
things
she
came
on
a
small
muslin
stained
with
blood
also
a
loop
of
black
ribbon
of
the
kind
that
little
girls
tie
their
hair
with
some
fine
reddish
hairs
were
still
tangled
in
the
knot
at
last
she
found
a
small
pocket
testament
mixed
up
with
some
of
his
neckties
it
was
old
and
worn
katherine
wondered
at
that
though
she
could
hardly
have
said
why
then
she
saw
written
on
the
in
a
sprawling
girl
hand
vincent
with
audrey
best
love
and
a
date
that
went
back
to
their
childhood
it
was
the
only
present
that
audrey
had
ever
made
him
and
one
that
had
cost
her
nothing
what
part
shall
i
read
she
was
afraid
that
vincent
would
lay
the
burden
of
choice
on
her
but
he
did
not
he
had
very
decided
ideas
of
his
own
the
eighth
of
romans
if
you
do
mind
an
eagle
feather
floated
out
from
between
the
pages
at
the
eighth
of
romans
it
had
been
picked
up
on
the
snows
of
the
rocky
mountains
if
she
had
wondered
at
first
she
soon
saw
why
vincent
had
chosen
that
chapter
of
all
others
therefore
brethren
we
are
debtors
not
to
the
flesh
to
live
after
the
flesh
for
if
ye
live
after
the
flesh
ye
shall
die
but
if
ye
through
the
spirit
do
mortify
the
deeds
of
the
body
ye
shall
live
vincent
was
dying
she
read
on
and
as
she
read
she
saw
behind
the
edges
of
the
veil
that
divides
the
seen
from
the
unseen
for
the
creature
was
made
subject
to
vanity
not
willingly
but
by
reason
of
him
who
hath
subjected
the
same
in
hope
because
the
creature
itself
also
shall
be
delivered
from
the
bondage
of
corruption
into
the
glorious
liberty
of
the
children
of
god
her
heart
beat
faster
and
her
breast
heaved
but
the
words
lifted
her
above
pathos
and
tears
and
prepared
her
for
the
consolation
of
the
close
do
you
believe
all
that
he
asked
suddenly
when
she
had
finished
she
had
not
expected
that
i
did
but
i
do
now
why
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
hers
scrutinising
pathetic
because
i
that
reason
seemed
to
be
hardly
enough
for
vincent
he
was
still
hesitating
and
uncertain
as
if
he
were
looking
for
something
that
she
could
not
give
him
then
he
lay
back
again
with
his
eyes
closed
it
was
katherine
turn
to
think
but
vincent
peace
of
mind
was
of
more
importance
to
her
than
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
a
creed
she
had
realised
that
there
were
things
that
even
her
love
could
not
do
for
him
with
a
sudden
flash
of
recollection
she
thought
of
the
young
priest
she
had
once
met
at
audrey
house
if
any
one
could
help
vincent
now
it
might
be
flaxman
reed
she
was
probably
mistaken
nobody
is
very
wise
between
twelve
and
one
in
the
morning
but
at
least
she
could
try
vincent
she
whispered
would
you
like
to
see
a
clergyman
she
smiled
for
after
all
it
might
be
the
very
last
thing
that
he
wanted
he
smiled
too
a
little
consciously
his
mood
had
changed
for
the
time
being
he
had
come
back
again
to
earth
no
thank
you
sis
but
i
should
like
what
tell
me
to
see
audrey
the
three
words
gave
her
a
shock
but
they
told
her
nothing
new
you
shall
i
send
for
her
first
thing
in
the
morning
he
turned
round
with
his
face
away
from
her
and
settled
himself
again
to
sleep
and
katherine
watched
he
would
be
audrey
he
was
hers
at
least
for
that
one
night
no
never
never
again
had
come
and
the
image
of
audrey
was
between
them
it
always
had
been
there
was
it
better
so
the
next
day
audrey
had
to
be
found
ted
went
to
chelsea
gardens
early
in
the
morning
supposing
her
to
be
there
the
house
was
shut
up
and
the
caretaker
had
mislaid
her
address
he
went
back
to
devon
street
katherine
and
ted
were
in
despair
vincent
alone
was
equal
to
the
emergency
his
mind
was
on
the
alert
it
had
grasped
all
the
necessary
details
he
gave
them
dean
craven
address
and
told
ted
to
wire
to
oxford
for
audrey
that
was
how
audrey
never
got
the
telegram
till
one
that
morning
the
doctor
pronounced
vincent
decidedly
better
the
change
he
said
was
something
miraculous
he
took
katherine
out
of
the
room
to
tell
her
so
keep
him
quiet
and
he
pull
through
yet
i
do
say
he
will
but
he
may
only
he
must
have
any
excitement
he
had
a
great
deal
this
morning
if
it
lasts
all
day
and
if
he
has
any
more
of
it
will
it
hurt
him
it
pleasant
excitement
you
know
the
doctor
looked
keenly
at
her
to
judge
by
her
white
face
she
was
not
sharing
in
the
pleasant
excitement
well
i
ca
say
pleasure
does
less
harm
than
pain
sometimes
let
him
have
any
suspense
though
suspense
will
kill
him
but
suspense
was
what
he
had
to
bear
katherine
knew
that
he
was
living
on
in
the
hope
of
audrey
coming
well
she
would
be
with
him
by
nine
at
the
latest
as
she
had
said
at
eight
vincent
began
to
listen
for
every
bell
at
nine
he
asked
to
have
the
door
set
ajar
that
he
might
hear
the
wheels
of
her
cab
in
the
street
but
though
many
cabs
went
by
none
stopped
she
missed
her
train
we
did
give
her
much
time
look
out
the
next
kathy
katherine
looked
it
out
she
be
here
by
eleven
if
she
catches
the
it
gets
to
paddington
at
ten
vincent
closed
his
eyes
and
waited
patiently
till
ten
then
he
became
excited
again
the
nervous
tension
increasing
with
every
quarter
of
an
hour
by
eleven
the
street
was
still
and
vincent
strained
his
ears
for
every
sound
but
no
sounds
were
to
be
heard
it
was
eleven
a
look
of
fear
had
come
over
his
face
katherine
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
went
into
the
next
room
where
ted
was
standing
at
the
window
she
laid
her
hands
on
his
shoulder
clinging
to
him
oh
ted
ted
she
whispered
fiercely
she
kill
him
he
if
she
does
come
and
she
is
coming
ted
had
never
known
his
sister
do
that
before
it
was
horrible
like
seeing
a
man
cry
he
put
his
arms
round
her
he
had
almost
to
hold
her
up
and
comforted
her
as
best
he
could
but
she
put
him
from
her
gently
and
went
back
to
her
post
she
come
vincent
she
said
no
if
she
were
coming
she
would
have
wired
but
that
was
just
what
audrey
had
forgotten
to
do
by
the
time
she
had
reached
barnstaple
she
was
too
much
taken
up
with
her
own
tragic
importance
to
think
of
any
small
detail
of
the
kind
vincent
had
turned
over
on
his
side
he
had
no
more
hope
and
nothing
mattered
now
he
had
done
his
best
but
was
not
going
to
carry
on
a
trivial
dispute
with
death
but
though
his
spirit
had
given
up
the
struggle
his
body
still
fought
on
with
its
own
blind
will
a
long
weary
fight
that
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
end
towards
morning
he
became
to
all
appearance
unconscious
at
seven
the
bell
rang
there
was
a
stir
in
the
hall
and
the
sound
of
rogers
voice
whispering
then
the
door
opened
and
closed
softly
audrey
was
standing
there
a
strange
figure
in
the
dim
white
room
wrapped
in
her
bearskins
and
glowing
with
life
and
the
fresh
morning
air
at
first
she
could
distinguish
nothing
in
the
shaded
light
then
she
made
out
ted
sitting
with
his
back
to
her
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
katherine
standing
at
the
head
of
it
but
when
she
saw
the
motionless
figure
raised
by
pillows
and
vaguely
defined
under
the
disordered
bedclothes
a
terror
seized
her
and
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
come
here
audrey
said
katherine
gently
and
she
came
gliding
trembling
as
she
had
come
to
him
that
afternoon
at
chelsea
a
year
and
a
half
ago
but
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
katherine
she
was
afraid
to
look
take
his
hand
speak
to
him
audrey
looked
round
but
ted
had
left
the
room
her
small
white
hand
slid
out
of
her
muff
warm
with
the
warm
fur
and
rested
on
hand
but
no
words
came
she
was
sick
with
fear
the
touch
was
enough
warm
and
caressing
the
little
fingers
curled
into
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
vincent
woke
from
his
stupor
he
opened
his
eyes
but
their
look
was
vague
and
wondering
he
was
not
conscious
yet
katherine
moved
aside
and
drew
up
the
blind
and
the
faint
daylight
fell
on
audrey
face
as
her
eyes
still
followed
katherine
for
one
instant
his
brain
seemed
to
fill
suddenly
with
light
it
streamed
from
his
brain
into
the
room
and
he
saw
her
standing
in
the
midst
of
it
audrey
the
loud
hoarse
voice
startled
katherine
and
made
audrey
shake
with
fright
his
hand
closed
tightly
on
hers
and
he
sank
back
into
unconsciousness
for
two
hours
the
two
women
kept
watch
together
by
his
bed
katherine
at
the
head
holding
vincent
in
her
strong
arms
audrey
sitting
at
the
foot
with
her
back
turned
to
him
pressing
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
at
nine
she
shivered
and
looked
round
as
vincent
head
sank
forward
on
his
breast
katherine
standing
at
the
back
of
the
bed
first
saw
what
had
happened
by
the
change
on
audrey
face
the
corners
of
her
mouth
had
suddenly
straightened
and
she
started
up
white
and
rigid
he
dead
take
me
away
katherine
take
me
away
but
this
time
katherine
neither
saw
nor
heard
her
no
he
was
bound
to
die
what
else
could
you
expect
after
the
life
he
led
poor
fellow
it
was
all
over
audrey
had
dragged
herself
out
of
the
room
she
scarcely
knew
how
dragged
herself
up
to
katherine
room
and
thrown
herself
on
the
bed
in
a
passion
of
weeping
and
katherine
kneeling
for
the
second
time
by
vincent
side
could
hear
the
verdict
of
science
through
the
door
crashawe
was
talking
to
ted
neither
audrey
nor
katherine
knew
how
they
got
through
the
next
three
days
audrey
was
afraid
to
sleep
alone
and
katherine
had
her
with
her
night
and
day
audrey
would
have
gone
back
to
chelsea
but
for
her
fear
and
for
a
feeling
that
to
leave
devon
street
would
be
a
miserable
abandonment
of
a
great
situation
all
those
three
days
katherine
was
tender
to
her
for
vincent
sake
happily
for
her
audrey
disliked
going
into
his
room
she
was
afraid
of
the
long
figure
under
the
straight
white
sheet
katherine
could
keep
her
watch
with
him
again
alone
she
had
no
rival
there
once
indeed
they
stood
by
his
bed
together
when
katherine
drew
back
the
sheet
from
his
face
and
audrey
laid
above
his
heart
a
wreath
of
eucharis
lilies
the
symbol
of
purity
they
stood
beside
him
the
woman
who
loved
him
and
the
woman
he
had
loved
and
they
envied
him
one
the
peace
the
other
the
glory
of
death
chapter
xxv
it
was
early
one
morning
about
a
week
after
the
funeral
hardy
had
gone
to
his
grave
followed
last
by
his
friends
and
first
by
his
next
of
kin
audrey
and
the
man
who
had
lavernac
audrey
was
still
as
she
always
had
been
his
affectionate
cousin
the
fact
was
expressly
stated
on
the
attached
to
the
flowers
wherewith
she
had
covered
his
coffin
it
was
in
katherine
bedroom
katherine
was
still
in
bed
waiting
for
audrey
to
be
dressed
before
her
audrey
was
sitting
at
the
brushing
her
hair
twisting
it
into
the
big
coil
that
shone
like
copper
on
the
surface
with
a
dull
dark
red
at
the
heart
of
it
she
had
on
katherine
white
and
katherine
slippers
she
had
laughed
when
she
put
them
on
they
were
so
ridiculously
large
for
her
tiny
feet
audrey
was
rebounding
after
the
pressure
that
had
been
put
on
her
during
the
last
ten
days
the
weight
was
lifted
now
after
all
she
had
not
felt
herself
an
important
actor
in
that
drama
of
death
death
himself
had
come
and
waived
her
coldly
aside
she
had
been
nothing
in
that
household
filled
with
his
presence
here
again
she
had
been
overpowered
by
one
of
those
unseen
incomprehensible
things
that
she
could
not
grasp
but
that
crushed
her
and
made
her
of
no
account
at
times
in
her
misery
she
had
even
felt
a
vague
faint
jealousy
of
the
dead
but
since
the
day
of
the
funeral
her
supple
nature
had
unbent
she
could
talk
now
and
she
talked
incessantly
generally
about
vincent
she
had
begun
by
monopolising
his
memory
making
it
a
sacred
possession
of
her
own
till
not
even
that
consolation
was
left
to
katherine
audrey
stood
between
her
and
every
scene
connected
in
her
mind
with
vincent
the
figure
of
audrey
seemed
to
draw
nearer
and
grow
larger
until
it
covered
everything
else
her
stream
of
talk
was
blotting
out
the
impressions
that
katherine
most
longed
to
keep
giving
to
the
past
a
transient
character
of
its
own
she
was
killing
remembrance
and
there
came
upon
katherine
a
fear
of
the
forgetfulness
where
all
things
end
and
now
as
she
lay
there
watching
audrey
she
recalled
the
truth
that
she
had
lost
sight
of
since
vincent
death
the
truth
that
he
had
told
her
he
would
have
loved
her
if
it
had
not
been
for
audrey
she
had
begun
to
realise
the
intensity
of
the
duel
which
had
been
between
audrey
and
her
from
the
first
it
had
begun
in
the
days
when
audrey
had
stood
in
the
way
of
career
it
had
gone
on
afterwards
when
it
was
to
be
feared
that
she
had
done
him
still
more
grievous
harm
and
it
had
ended
in
separating
katherine
from
vincent
and
even
from
his
memory
rather
that
duel
had
neither
beginning
nor
end
there
was
something
foregone
and
inevitable
about
it
something
that
had
its
roots
deep
down
in
their
opposite
natures
it
had
to
be
it
had
been
from
the
hour
when
she
first
met
audrey
until
now
when
the
two
women
were
again
thrown
together
in
a
detestable
mockery
of
friendship
forced
into
each
other
arms
lying
by
each
other
side
audrey
had
been
quiet
for
some
time
and
katherine
was
nervously
wondering
when
she
would
begin
katherine
she
said
at
last
i
want
you
to
come
back
with
me
to
chelsea
the
fact
was
miss
craven
was
in
devonshire
and
audrey
was
still
afraid
to
be
in
the
house
by
herself
i
could
possibly
i
ca
leave
ted
that
does
matter
ted
can
come
too
what
audrey
mind
like
had
it
no
memory
i
think
not
audrey
audrey
said
no
more
she
gave
the
last
touches
to
her
hair
put
on
her
black
dress
and
turned
herself
slowly
round
before
the
she
was
satisfied
with
the
result
it
was
her
last
day
in
devon
street
so
the
havilands
had
to
be
nice
to
her
ted
went
out
soon
after
breakfast
he
was
incapable
of
any
sustained
effort
audrey
did
not
know
it
but
the
boy
hated
the
house
now
that
she
was
in
it
katherine
had
dreaded
being
left
alone
with
her
that
morning
she
knew
that
last
words
would
come
and
they
came
they
were
sitting
together
by
the
studio
fire
talking
about
indifferent
subjects
when
suddenly
audrey
left
her
seat
and
knelt
down
by
katherine
knees
in
at
attitude
of
confession
katherine
she
began
and
her
grey
eyes
filled
with
tears
before
i
go
i
want
to
tell
you
something
what
is
it
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
really
loved
vincent
all
the
time
she
waited
to
see
the
effect
of
her
words
but
katherine
set
her
teeth
firmly
and
said
nothing
audrey
went
on
still
kneeling
i
do
know
what
made
me
get
engaged
to
ted
i
liked
him
you
know
dear
boy
but
i
think
it
was
because
vincent
would
not
understand
me
and
he
wanted
to
hurry
things
so
and
you
see
i
did
know
then
how
much
i
loved
him
then
afterwards
she
stopped
she
had
come
to
the
difficult
part
of
her
confession
well
then
you
see
i
knew
wyndham
and
he
another
pause
what
did
wyndham
do
it
was
better
that
she
should
talk
about
wyndham
than
about
vincent
i
do
know
what
he
did
but
he
made
me
mad
he
made
me
think
i
cared
for
him
he
was
so
clever
you
know
i
always
adored
clever
people
and
well
nobody
could
call
poor
vincent
clever
they
in
spite
of
herself
katherine
lip
curled
with
scorn
but
audrey
was
too
much
absorbed
in
her
confession
to
see
it
i
suppose
that
fascinated
me
then
afterwards
when
vincent
took
to
those
dreadful
ways
whatever
my
feelings
were
you
katherine
it
was
impossible
katherine
could
bear
it
no
longer
but
she
managed
to
control
her
voice
in
answering
why
do
you
tell
me
these
things
do
you
suppose
i
care
to
hear
about
your
if
you
do
feel
if
i
feel
kathy
well
why
ca
you
keep
quiet
now
it
too
late
because
because
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
loved
him
there
was
silence
presently
audrey
put
one
hand
on
katherine
knee
kathy
i
rather
you
did
call
me
that
if
you
do
mind
why
audrey
stared
with
large
incomprehensive
eyes
i
ca
tell
you
why
katherine
then
it
prettier
do
you
know
i
sometimes
think
better
oh
infinitely
better
that
he
should
have
died
katherine
rose
from
her
seat
to
end
it
looking
down
on
the
kneeling
figure
as
she
answered
bitterly
it
was
indeed
infinitely
better
but
irony
like
so
many
other
things
of
the
kind
was
beyond
audrey
i
suppose
i
ought
to
go
now
she
said
rising
katherine
made
no
answer
audrey
went
away
to
get
ready
a
little
reluctantly
for
she
had
so
much
more
to
say
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
to
be
jealous
of
katherine
that
may
have
been
either
because
she
did
not
know
or
because
she
did
not
care
she
had
been
so
sure
of
vincent
presently
she
came
back
with
her
hat
on
she
carried
her
bearskins
in
her
hand
and
under
the
shade
of
the
broad
black
beaver
her
face
wore
an
expression
of
anxious
thought
katherine
she
held
out
her
cape
and
muff
and
katherine
remembered
that
they
were
those
which
vincent
had
given
her
i
suppose
i
can
wear
my
furs
still
even
if
i
in
mourning
there
was
neither
scorn
nor
irony
in
the
look
that
katherine
turned
on
her
and
audrey
understood
this
time
as
plainly
as
looks
can
speak
it
condemned
her
as
altogether
lighter
than
vanity
itself
and
while
condemning
it
forgave
her
gave
them
to
me
you
know
she
said
at
last
audrey
pathos
generally
came
too
late
she
drove
away
wrapped
in
her
furs
and
for
once
unconscious
of
her
own
beauty
so
dissatisfied
was
she
with
the
part
she
had
played
in
the
great
tragedy
somehow
her
parts
seemed
always
to
dwindle
this
way
in
retrospect
that
afternoon
a
parcel
arrived
addressed
to
hardy
by
his
publishers
katherine
opened
it
it
contained
early
copies
of
the
the
book
that
after
all
vincent
was
never
to
see
she
saw
with
a
pang
her
own
design
blazing
in
gold
on
the
cover
and
her
frontispiece
sketch
of
the
author
then
she
turned
to
the
dedication
page
and
read
to
her
who
has
inspired
all
that
there
may
be
of
good
in
it
this
book
is
dedicated
by
her
affectionate
cousin
vincent
hardy
it
was
an
epitaph
chapter
xxvi
one
day
work
among
the
poor
of
teresa
lambeth
is
enough
to
exhaust
you
if
you
are
at
all
sensitive
and
highly
strung
and
audrey
had
had
three
days
of
it
no
wonder
then
that
as
she
leaned
back
in
a
particularly
hard
wooden
chair
in
the
vicar
study
every
nerve
in
her
body
was
on
edge
it
was
a
year
after
vincent
death
with
lapse
of
time
that
event
had
lost
much
of
its
oppressive
magnificence
and
it
affected
audrey
more
in
looking
back
than
it
had
done
in
reality
time
too
had
thrown
her
relations
with
wyndham
into
relief
and
as
she
realised
more
and
more
their
true
nature
the
conscience
that
had
been
so
long
quiescent
began
to
stir
in
her
its
voice
seemed
to
be
seconding
wyndham
and
katherine
verdict
she
became
uneasy
about
herself
once
more
this
time
in
serious
sincerity
she
felt
the
need
of
a
stronger
personality
upholding
and
pervading
her
own
absolute
dependence
on
somebody
character
had
become
a
habit
of
her
nature
she
could
no
more
live
now
without
some
burning
stimulus
to
thought
and
feeling
than
the
drunkard
can
satisfy
his
thirst
with
plain
water
naturally
she
thought
of
flaxman
reed
as
katherine
had
thought
of
him
the
midnight
before
vincent
death
or
as
she
had
thought
of
him
herself
in
the
day
of
her
temptation
this
time
she
had
ended
by
going
to
him
as
many
a
woman
had
gone
before
with
her
empty
life
in
her
hands
begging
that
it
might
be
filled
for
all
cases
of
the
kind
flaxman
reed
had
one
remedy
work
in
the
parish
of
teresa
as
a
rule
it
either
killed
or
cured
them
but
he
had
spared
audrey
hitherto
as
he
would
have
spared
some
sick
child
a
medicine
too
strong
and
bitter
for
it
finally
much
to
his
surprise
she
asked
him
for
the
work
of
her
own
accord
and
he
gave
it
to
her
and
now
she
had
had
three
days
of
it
it
was
enough
it
made
her
head
ache
yet
to
think
of
all
she
had
gone
through
for
the
first
two
days
she
had
been
sustained
by
a
new
and
wholly
delightful
sensation
the
consciousness
of
her
own
goodness
on
the
third
day
that
support
had
suddenly
given
way
a
woman
coarse
word
the
way
a
man
had
looked
at
her
as
she
lifted
her
silk
petticoats
out
of
the
mud
some
bit
of
crude
criticism
such
as
demos
publishes
at
street
corners
in
the
expressive
vernacular
had
been
sufficient
to
destroy
all
the
bright
illusions
that
gilded
the
gutters
of
lambeth
reflections
of
a
day
that
was
not
hers
and
yet
she
had
come
into
a
new
world
with
new
ideas
and
new
emotions
if
not
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
it
was
better
than
any
which
had
once
seemed
probable
and
she
wanted
to
stay
in
it
she
was
dazzled
by
the
splendour
of
religion
the
curtain
had
risen
on
the
great
of
the
soul
she
too
longed
to
dance
in
the
masque
of
the
virtues
and
the
graces
every
fresh
phase
of
life
had
presented
itself
to
audrey
in
spectacular
magnificence
she
could
not
help
seeing
things
so
it
was
the
way
her
mind
worked
the
candles
burning
on
the
high
altar
of
teresa
were
only
footlights
in
the
wrong
place
and
the
veil
that
flaxman
reed
had
lifted
a
little
for
her
was
the
curtain
going
up
before
another
stage
meanwhile
while
she
had
to
consider
his
possible
criticism
of
her
own
acting
sitting
in
the
hard
ascetic
chair
she
looked
round
the
room
and
tried
to
understand
a
little
of
its
owner
life
every
detail
in
it
was
a
challenge
to
her
intelligence
she
perplexed
herself
with
questions
why
did
flaxman
reed
have
a
proper
carpet
on
the
floor
why
did
he
hang
a
curtain
over
that
ugly
green
baize
door
it
led
into
the
room
where
he
held
his
classes
and
entertained
his
poorer
parishioners
that
room
was
also
his
how
could
he
eat
his
meals
after
all
those
dreadful
people
had
been
in
it
poor
things
why
only
common
deal
a
varnished
desk
and
that
little
painted
table
underneath
the
big
crucifix
why
these
painfully
uneasy
chairs
and
yes
only
one
picture
and
that
of
the
most
emaciated
of
madonnas
could
not
her
old
favourite
botticelli
have
supplied
him
with
a
lovelier
type
or
there
was
raphael
sometimes
on
a
sunday
evening
after
service
she
had
come
in
here
from
the
rich
warm
scented
church
with
the
music
of
an
august
liturgy
ringing
in
her
ears
and
the
chill
place
had
struck
like
death
to
all
her
senses
and
this
was
the
atmosphere
in
which
his
life
was
spent
this
and
the
gaunt
streets
and
the
terrible
slums
of
lambeth
she
was
not
left
long
alone
for
flaxman
reed
never
kept
any
one
waiting
if
he
could
help
it
as
he
seated
himself
opposite
to
her
the
set
lines
of
his
face
relaxed
and
his
manner
softened
her
eyes
followed
the
outline
of
his
face
which
stood
out
white
and
sharp
against
the
dark
she
noted
the
crossed
legs
the
hands
folded
on
his
knees
the
weary
pose
of
the
whole
wasted
figure
it
ought
to
have
been
an
appeal
to
her
pity
the
poor
man
was
suffering
from
many
kinds
of
hunger
and
from
intense
exhaustion
he
had
just
dismissed
a
tiresome
parishioner
and
vexed
with
himself
for
having
kept
audrey
waiting
had
left
his
dinner
in
the
next
room
untouched
and
came
all
unnerved
to
this
interview
which
he
dreaded
yet
desired
he
listened
quietly
to
the
story
of
her
failure
it
was
not
only
what
he
had
expected
but
what
he
had
wished
it
no
good
my
trying
any
more
she
urged
in
the
pleading
voice
that
she
could
make
so
sweet
i
ca
do
anything
the
sight
of
those
poor
wretches
misery
only
makes
me
miserable
too
i
dream
of
it
at
night
i
assure
you
it
been
the
most
awful
three
days
i
ever
spent
in
my
life
has
it
yes
i
feel
things
so
terribly
you
know
and
it
not
as
if
i
could
do
anything
i
simply
ca
what
you
think
of
me
i
think
nothing
i
knew
that
you
would
tell
me
this
and
i
am
glad
are
you
glad
that
i
failed
yes
glad
and
thankful
he
paused
his
thin
sensitive
lips
trembled
and
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
in
a
low
constrained
voice
as
if
he
were
struggling
with
some
powerful
feeling
i
wanted
you
to
learn
by
failure
that
it
is
not
what
we
know
nor
what
we
do
but
what
we
are
that
matters
in
the
sight
of
god
yes
i
know
that
she
sat
looking
up
with
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
holding
her
chin
in
one
hand
it
had
been
her
attitude
in
her
student
days
at
oxford
when
trying
to
follow
a
difficult
lecture
and
she
reverted
to
it
now
for
flaxman
reed
was
very
difficult
his
style
fascinated
and
yet
repelled
her
and
in
this
case
the
style
was
the
man
what
am
i
said
audrey
presently
it
was
a
curious
question
and
none
of
her
friends
had
answered
it
to
her
satisfaction
she
was
eager
to
know
reed
opinion
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
and
his
eyes
were
two
clear
lights
under
the
shadow
of
the
sharp
eyebone
what
are
you
with
all
your
faults
and
all
your
failures
you
are
something
infinitely
more
valuable
than
you
know
what
makes
you
say
so
i
say
so
because
i
think
that
god
cares
more
for
those
that
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
than
for
those
who
are
filled
at
his
table
believe
me
nothing
in
all
our
intercourse
has
touched
me
so
much
as
this
confession
of
your
failure
has
it
really
can
you
can
you
trust
me
again
in
spite
of
it
yes
you
have
trusted
me
i
take
it
as
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
the
greatest
privileges
of
my
life
that
you
should
have
come
to
me
as
you
have
done
not
when
you
were
bright
and
happy
but
in
your
weakness
and
distress
in
what
i
imagine
to
have
been
the
darkest
hour
of
all
when
refuge
failed
you
and
no
man
cared
for
your
soul
no
that
the
worst
of
it
that
there
nobody
to
turn
to
nobody
cares
if
i
thought
that
you
cared
but
indeed
i
care
for
my
soul
yes
her
yes
was
a
deep
sigh
why
not
it
is
my
office
a
priest
is
answerable
to
god
for
the
souls
of
his
people
he
spoke
with
a
touch
of
austerity
in
his
tone
something
warned
him
that
if
this
conversation
was
to
be
profitable
to
either
of
them
he
must
avoid
personalities
his
position
in
the
church
was
a
compromise
his
attitude
towards
audrey
craven
was
only
another
kind
of
compromise
so
much
concession
to
her
weakness
so
much
to
her
appealing
womanhood
he
had
begun
by
believing
in
her
soul
that
was
the
plea
he
made
to
the
fierce
exacting
conscience
always
requiring
a
spiritual
motive
for
his
simplest
actions
and
he
had
ended
by
creating
the
thing
he
believed
in
and
in
his
own
language
he
was
answerable
to
god
for
it
but
hitherto
with
his
own
nature
he
had
made
no
compromise
he
had
sacrificed
heart
senses
and
intellect
to
the
tyranny
of
his
conscience
he
had
ceased
to
dread
their
insane
revolt
against
that
benevolent
despotism
and
now
the
question
that
tormented
him
was
whether
all
the
time
he
had
not
been
temporising
with
his
own
inexorable
humanity
whether
his
relations
with
audrey
craven
did
not
involve
a
perpetual
intrigue
between
the
earthly
and
the
heavenly
for
there
was
a
strange
discrepancy
between
his
simple
heart
that
took
all
things
seriously
even
a
frivolous
woman
and
the
tortuous
entangled
thing
that
was
his
conscience
he
went
on
at
first
in
the
same
voice
monotonous
but
for
a
peculiar
throbbing
stress
on
some
words
and
he
seemed
to
be
speaking
more
to
himself
than
her
you
say
you
can
do
nothing
and
i
believe
it
what
of
that
the
things
that
are
seen
are
temporal
the
things
that
are
unseen
are
eternal
our
deeds
are
of
the
things
that
are
seen
they
are
part
of
the
visible
finite
world
done
with
our
hands
with
our
body
they
belong
to
the
flesh
that
profiteth
nothing
it
is
only
the
spirit
only
the
pure
and
holy
will
that
gives
them
life
that
will
is
not
ours
not
yours
or
mine
before
we
can
receive
it
our
will
must
die
otherwise
there
would
be
two
wills
in
us
struggling
for
possession
you
have
come
to
me
for
help
after
all
i
can
give
you
none
i
can
only
tell
you
what
i
know
that
there
is
no
way
of
peace
but
the
way
of
renunciation
i
can
only
say
if
your
will
is
not
yet
one
with
god
will
renounce
it
give
it
up
then
and
then
only
you
will
live
not
before
look
there
he
pointed
to
the
crucifix
the
great
pagan
religions
had
each
their
symbol
of
life
for
us
who
are
christ
the
symbol
of
life
is
the
crucifix
crucify
self
when
you
have
done
that
you
will
have
no
need
to
come
and
ask
me
what
you
must
do
and
what
you
must
leave
undone
your
deeds
are
they
be
pure
his
excitement
moved
her
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
she
followed
his
words
slowly
and
painfully
he
was
always
making
these
speeches
to
her
full
of
the
things
she
could
not
understand
how
often
she
had
felt
this
sense
of
effort
and
pain
in
the
old
art
days
with
ted
or
when
she
had
been
held
helpless
in
the
grasp
of
wyndham
relentless
intellect
she
had
chafed
when
the
barriers
rose
between
her
mind
and
theirs
but
between
her
and
this
nineteenth
century
ascetic
there
was
an
immeasurable
gulf
fixed
she
could
not
reach
the
hand
he
stretched
out
to
her
across
it
even
his
living
presence
seemed
endlessly
far
from
hers
and
the
thought
of
that
separation
filled
her
with
a
deep
resigned
humility
now
though
his
thoughts
were
poured
into
her
consciousness
without
mixing
with
it
cloudy
insoluble
troubling
its
blank
transparency
something
in
the
rhythmic
movement
of
his
words
stirred
her
so
responsive
was
she
to
every
impression
of
sense
they
recalled
to
her
that
other
gospel
of
life
preached
to
her
by
langley
and
though
she
understood
imperfectly
she
felt
the
difference
with
shame
the
young
priest
went
on
still
as
if
speaking
to
himself
there
are
only
two
things
we
have
to
learn
the
knowledge
of
self
and
the
knowledge
of
god
and
they
hang
together
if
there
is
any
sin
in
us
unconfessed
and
unrecognised
as
sin
there
is
no
knowledge
of
god
and
no
union
with
him
possible
for
us
she
rose
moved
a
step
forward
and
then
stood
looking
at
him
irresolutely
truly
a
revelation
was
there
for
her
but
she
was
in
that
state
of
excitement
in
which
we
are
more
capable
of
making
revelations
than
of
receiving
them
he
had
risen
too
and
was
holding
out
his
hand
well
he
said
more
gently
there
is
something
you
want
to
say
to
me
please
sit
down
again
she
shook
her
head
and
still
stood
upright
possessed
with
the
thought
of
the
confession
she
was
about
to
make
she
felt
that
she
needed
all
the
dignity
that
attitude
afforded
at
last
she
spoke
very
low
and
quickly
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
you
say
you
know
me
but
you
do
you
do
know
what
i
am
what
i
am
capable
of
but
i
must
tell
you
the
thought
of
it
is
stifling
me
once
only
two
years
ago
i
had
a
terrible
temptation
it
came
to
me
through
some
one
whom
i
loved
very
dearly
i
was
ready
to
give
up
everything
you
understand
for
him
and
i
would
have
done
it
only
god
was
good
to
me
he
made
it
impossible
for
me
and
i
was
saved
but
i
am
just
as
bad
just
as
guilty
as
if
he
had
let
it
happen
it
was
done
the
unutterable
thing
was
said
for
once
audrey
had
been
absolutely
truthful
and
sincere
the
soul
that
he
had
evoked
had
come
forth
as
it
were
out
of
the
darkness
at
first
neither
of
them
spoke
then
he
sat
down
and
thanked
her
simply
for
what
she
had
just
told
him
but
to
his
own
shame
and
grief
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
he
had
heard
many
a
confession
and
from
many
a
guiltier
woman
lips
but
none
so
piteous
because
none
so
purely
spontaneous
as
this
and
to
all
he
had
given
pity
counsel
and
help
but
now
he
was
dumb
she
was
thirsting
for
help
for
help
that
she
could
understand
she
clasped
her
hands
imploringly
and
looked
into
his
face
but
it
had
no
pity
for
her
and
no
deliverance
she
could
see
nothing
there
but
grief
grief
terrible
and
profound
i
see
then
you
too
judge
me
like
the
rest
god
forbid
i
judge
no
man
which
was
true
for
it
was
the
woman
he
had
judged
she
looked
at
him
again
a
long
look
full
of
wonder
and
reproach
then
she
went
quietly
away
she
had
reached
the
end
of
the
narrow
passage
leading
from
the
study
to
the
front
hall
when
she
recollected
that
she
had
left
behind
her
a
small
manual
of
devotion
he
had
given
it
to
her
not
long
ago
she
went
back
for
it
and
knocked
softly
at
the
study
door
there
was
no
answer
and
supposing
that
he
had
gone
through
into
the
room
beyond
she
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
he
was
kneeling
in
the
far
corner
of
the
study
with
his
hands
stretched
out
before
the
crucifix
from
the
threshold
where
she
stood
she
could
see
the
agony
of
his
uplifted
face
and
hear
his
prayer
o
wretched
man
that
i
am
who
shall
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
death
audrey
knew
then
that
for
one
moment
the
love
she
had
hungered
and
thirsted
after
more
than
after
righteousness
had
been
actually
within
her
grasp
and
that
she
had
lost
it
the
shadow
of
an
uncommitted
sin
stood
between
her
and
the
one
man
by
whom
and
for
whom
she
could
have
grown
pure
and
womanly
and
good
for
flaxman
reed
had
loved
her
though
up
to
that
evening
he
had
been
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
fact
being
already
wedded
to
what
the
world
considers
an
impossible
ideal
such
is
the
power
of
suggestion
that
audrey
confession
of
her
weakness
had
revealed
to
him
his
own
if
she
had
been
all
that
he
believed
her
to
be
he
might
not
have
regarded
his
feeling
for
her
as
in
itself
of
the
nature
of
sin
but
his
sensitive
soul
made
morbid
by
its
asceticism
recoiled
from
the
very
thought
of
impurity
in
the
woman
he
loved
hence
his
powerlessness
to
help
her
he
knew
none
better
that
a
stronger
man
would
not
have
felt
this
difficulty
he
had
trembled
before
his
own
intellect
now
he
was
afraid
of
his
own
heart
audrey
it
was
for
such
that
his
christ
had
died
and
he
could
not
even
speak
a
word
to
save
her
he
became
almost
blasphemous
in
his
agony
christ
had
died
on
cross
he
christ
servant
had
crucified
self
and
it
could
not
die
was
this
the
ironic
destiny
of
all
ideals
too
austere
for
earth
too
divine
for
humanity
not
long
afterwards
flaxman
reed
was
received
into
the
communion
of
the
church
of
rome
he
had
done
with
compromise
chapter
xxvii
it
was
audrey
fate
to
be
condemned
by
those
whom
she
had
most
cared
for
ted
and
vincent
langley
and
katherine
and
lastly
flaxman
reed
they
had
all
judged
her
harshly
imperfectly
as
human
nature
judges
of
the
five
perhaps
vincent
because
he
was
a
child
of
nature
and
katherine
because
she
was
a
good
woman
alone
appreciated
the
more
pathetic
of
audrey
effects
she
presented
the
moving
spectacle
of
a
small
creature
struggling
with
things
too
great
for
her
love
art
nature
religion
she
had
never
really
given
herself
up
to
any
one
of
them
but
she
had
called
upon
them
all
in
turn
and
instead
of
sustaining
they
had
overwhelmed
her
and
it
seemed
that
flaxman
reed
as
the
minister
of
the
religion
in
which
she
had
sought
shelter
for
a
day
had
failed
her
the
most
unexpectedly
and
in
her
direst
necessity
and
yet
he
had
done
more
for
her
than
any
of
the
others
she
had
lied
to
all
of
them
he
had
made
it
possible
for
her
to
be
true
flaxman
reed
would
certainly
not
have
called
himself
a
psychological
realist
but
by
reason
of
his
one
strength
his
habit
of
constant
communion
with
the
unseen
he
had
solved
langley
wyndham
problem
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
the
great
novelist
in
his
search
for
the
real
audrey
to
look
deeper
than
the
primitive
passions
or
to
suspect
that
the
secret
of
personality
could
lie
in
so
pure
a
piece
of
mechanism
as
the
human
conscience
soon
after
her
confession
audrey
left
town
for
the
neighbourhood
of
oxford
she
may
have
perceived
that
london
was
too
vast
a
stage
for
her
slender
performances
or
she
may
have
had
some
idea
of
following
up
a
line
slanting
gently
between
the
two
paths
pointed
out
to
her
by
langley
wyndham
and
flaxman
reed
who
had
been
the
strongest
forces
in
her
life
she
had
come
to
herself
but
she
was
not
the
stuff
of
which
renunciants
are
made
it
was
about
three
years
later
that
langley
wyndham
looking
over
his
times
one
morning
had
the
joy
of
reading
the
announcement
of
miss
audrey
craven
marriage
with
algernon
jackson
of
broughton
poggs
in
the
county
of
oxfordshire
it
was
true
after
all
audrey
had
married
a
nonentity
it
was
the
end
of
her
long
quest
of
the
eminent
and
superlative
jackson
was
certainly
not
an
eminent
person
and
he
was
superlative
only
in
so
far
as
he
passed
for
the
biggest
bore
in
the
county
but
he
had
the
positive
merit
of
being
a
gentleman
which
in
these
days
of
a
talented
democracy
amounts
almost
to
genius
since
that
night
when
as
a
guileless
undergraduate
he
had
interfered
with
audrey
first
introduction
to
langley
wyndham
jackson
career
had
been
simplicity
itself
he
had
tried
most
of
the
learned
professions
and
failed
in
all
he
tried
he
then
took
up
model
on
a
large
scale
and
achieved
success
amidst
the
jeers
of
his
family
and
friends
the
echo
of
that
derision
was
soon
lost
in
the
jingle
of
guineas
not
every
one
can
attain
a
golden
mediocrity
and
it
was
a
great
step
for
a
man
who
had
hitherto
ranked
as
a
nonentity
on
the
strength
of
it
he
asked
the
beautiful
miss
craven
to
be
his
wife
and
no
one
was
more
surprised
than
himself
when
she
consented
she
was
his
first
and
last
love
of
a
series
of
loves
for
jackson
had
never
read
laura
indeed
he
read
but
few
books
and
if
you
had
told
him
of
langley
wyndham
masterpiece
he
would
have
forgotten
all
about
it
by
he
would
certainly
never
have
thought
of
identifying
its
heroine
with
his
wife
nobody
ever
understood
why
audrey
made
that
marriage
for
any
one
who
had
enjoyed
the
friendship
of
such
men
as
langley
wyndham
and
flaxman
reed
there
was
bathos
in
the
step
it
seemed
an
ugly
concession
to
actuality
it
may
have
been
for
audrey
was
nothing
if
not
modern
the
daughter
of
an
age
that
has
flirted
with
ideals
all
equally
fascinating
and
finally
decided
in
favour
of
a
mature
realism
she
may
have
learned
that
hardest
lesson
of
the
schools
the
translation
of
life
drama
from
fancy
into
fact
found
out
that
all
the
time
the
grey
old
chorus
has
been
singing
not
of
love
and
joy
as
she
once
in
her
ignorance
imagined
but
of
unspeakable
rest
on
the
great
consoling
platitudes
of
life
where
there
is
no
more
revelation
because
there
is
no
mystery
and
no
despair
because
there
is
no
hope
the
text
of
that
chorus
is
often
corrupt
but
the
meaning
is
never
hopelessly
obscure
in
other
words
she
may
have
married
jackson
in
a
fit
of
pessimism
or
perhaps
perhaps
she
had
profited
by
the
more
cheerful
though
equally
important
lesson
of
the
playground
learned
that
whether
the
game
of
life
be
fast
or
slow
dull
or
amusing
matters
little
when
you
are
knocked
out
in
the
first
round
she
herself
had
had
many
rounds
not
counting
jackson
that
in
these
circumstances
one
may
still
find
considerable
entertainment
in
looking
on
and
that
in
any
case
the
player
is
not
for
the
game
but
the
game
for
the
player
the
player
who
may
be
left
on
the
ground
long
after
all
games
have
been
played
out
but
this
is
to
suppose
that
audrey
was
a
philosopher
which
is
manifestly
absurd
perhaps
more
likely
than
not
her
revelation
came
when
she
was
least
looking
for
it
stumbling
by
the
merest
accident
on
one
of
the
great
things
of
life
the
eternal
the
incomprehensible
for
of
these
some
say
that
the
greatest
is
love
it
is
certainly
the
most
incomprehensible
she
may
have
loved
jackson
if
she
did
not
