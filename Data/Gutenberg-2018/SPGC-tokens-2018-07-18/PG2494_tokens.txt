for
greater
things
the
story
of
saint
stanislaus
kostka
by
william
kane
with
a
preface
by
james
daly
preface
among
christian
evidences
the
heroic
virtue
and
holiness
of
catholic
youth
must
not
be
overlooked
juvenile
and
adolescent
victories
of
a
conspicuous
kind
over
the
flesh
the
world
and
the
devil
can
be
found
in
no
land
and
in
no
age
except
a
christian
land
and
age
and
in
no
church
except
the
catholic
church
it
is
of
all
excellences
the
very
rarest
and
most
difficult
this
triumphant
mastery
over
human
weakness
and
human
pride
it
has
defied
the
strivings
of
men
whom
the
world
recognizes
as
beings
of
superior
wisdom
and
power
of
will
the
philosophers
who
have
described
it
most
beautifully
and
encouraged
its
pursuit
in
the
most
glowing
and
impressive
terms
remain
themselves
sad
examples
of
human
futility
in
the
struggle
to
disengage
the
spirit
from
the
claws
of
dragging
and
unclean
influences
for
the
forces
of
evil
are
infinite
in
their
variety
insidious
beyond
the
ability
of
natural
sharpness
to
detect
and
guard
against
and
unsleeping
in
the
pressure
of
their
siege
upon
the
heart
of
man
who
will
explain
how
it
comes
to
pass
that
youth
whose
callowness
and
inexperience
are
the
mockery
of
the
world
has
laid
prostrate
in
single
combat
this
giant
of
evil
and
won
fields
where
the
reputations
of
the
world
wisest
and
noblest
and
most
tried
lie
buried
it
is
a
matter
of
idle
curiosity
with
us
how
an
unbelieving
generation
ingenious
in
devising
natural
explanations
which
are
most
unnatural
of
supernatural
phenomena
would
explain
away
the
wonder
of
the
young
saint
life
which
is
the
subject
of
the
following
pages
it
presents
to
us
a
picture
of
divine
condescension
guiding
and
inspiring
and
aiding
human
effort
so
convincingly
clear
and
transparent
in
its
smallest
details
and
in
its
general
effect
as
to
seem
outside
the
pale
of
all
possible
mutilation
and
misinterpretation
by
malice
or
skeptical
analysis
natural
reaction
against
sinful
excess
thwarted
ambitions
disappointed
hopes
meek
conformity
with
environment
ecclesiastical
manipulation
of
pliant
material
tame
acquiescence
in
family
traditions
and
arrangements
these
and
all
the
other
stock
explanations
with
which
a
groveling
world
seeks
to
pull
down
the
saints
to
its
own
dreary
level
can
not
be
invoked
to
dissipate
the
mystery
and
the
glory
surrounding
stanislaus
how
did
he
come
so
early
in
life
and
in
a
family
to
set
such
store
upon
spiritual
values
how
did
his
tender
and
immature
mind
grasp
with
such
swift
sureness
the
one
lesson
of
all
philosophies
that
life
on
its
material
side
is
an
incident
rather
than
the
sum
of
human
existence
and
can
never
satisfy
the
soul
desires
how
could
this
mere
boy
have
developed
so
young
an
iron
will
which
wrought
that
hardest
of
all
laborious
tasks
namely
the
conformation
of
conduct
with
lofty
ideals
there
are
supernatural
answers
to
these
and
similar
questions
which
might
be
raised
concerning
the
brief
career
of
stanislaus
we
know
of
no
merely
natural
answers
the
lively
and
energetic
style
adopted
in
the
present
biography
may
create
a
trace
of
mild
surprise
in
older
readers
sanctity
it
is
true
some
one
may
say
is
a
very
beautiful
achievement
in
a
world
of
poor
and
at
best
mediocre
performance
but
after
all
the
business
of
sanctity
is
a
serious
business
it
calls
for
grit
and
endurance
and
as
a
picture
is
only
saved
from
the
sordid
by
spiritual
motives
which
are
unseen
if
all
moral
life
is
a
monotonous
warfare
the
life
of
a
saint
is
warfare
in
the
very
first
ranks
where
the
trenches
are
filled
with
water
and
the
shells
fall
thickest
and
the
general
discomfort
and
pettiness
are
at
their
maximum
it
is
misleading
and
not
in
strict
accord
with
known
realities
to
paint
the
portrait
of
a
saint
in
rose
color
and
sunlight
diffusing
an
iridescent
atmosphere
of
cheerful
gayety
and
buoyancy
the
criticism
is
not
without
some
foundation
but
youthful
readers
will
not
adopt
it
for
youth
is
generous
and
age
is
crabbed
and
because
saints
never
become
crabbed
we
are
right
in
concluding
that
they
always
remain
youthful
and
to
draw
out
our
conclusion
the
lives
of
saints
contrary
to
the
popular
belief
are
much
more
interesting
to
the
child
than
they
are
to
the
man
it
is
a
pity
that
catholic
parents
do
not
recognize
this
outstanding
truth
no
saint
life
is
dull
to
the
average
intelligent
child
are
dull
they
never
yield
to
sublime
impulses
they
measure
calculate
practice
a
moderation
reduce
the
splendid
possibilities
of
life
to
a
drab
level
of
safe
actuality
and
pursue
ideals
at
a
canny
and
cautious
pace
not
so
the
saints
they
always
retained
the
freshness
and
confidence
and
generous
impulses
of
childhood
if
god
spoke
to
their
inner
ear
and
bade
them
leap
boldly
forth
into
his
infinite
arms
spurning
irretrievably
the
solid
footing
of
our
spinning
globe
without
hesitation
or
question
they
took
the
leap
and
every
child
can
see
the
wisdom
of
it
to
the
child
it
is
common
sense
to
his
elders
it
is
inspired
heroism
or
unintelligible
hardihood
we
have
always
entertained
a
seated
suspicion
that
there
is
no
child
who
does
not
think
it
easy
to
be
a
saint
so
native
is
sanctity
to
catholic
childhood
cardinal
newman
we
believe
exhorted
us
all
to
make
our
sacrifices
for
god
while
we
are
young
before
the
calculating
selfishness
of
old
age
gets
hold
of
us
still
it
may
not
be
quite
clear
to
the
inquiring
mind
why
the
desperate
difficulties
of
sainthood
can
be
truthfully
viewed
in
the
light
of
a
breathless
adventure
learn
then
the
great
secret
the
love
of
god
in
the
heart
is
the
magical
light
which
touches
the
dreariness
and
hardship
of
with
a
splendor
of
sublime
romance
you
can
not
have
holiness
without
love
holiness
can
be
either
greater
nor
less
than
the
love
of
god
let
this
love
faint
or
grow
cold
there
is
at
once
a
loss
of
holiness
even
though
it
retain
all
its
external
gear
this
is
a
cardinal
truth
it
is
a
key
which
will
solve
many
a
puzzle
it
will
explain
why
fanatics
and
similar
oddities
are
not
saints
though
secular
history
sometimes
honors
them
with
the
title
merely
concede
that
the
saint
possesses
love
for
god
in
an
extraordinary
measure
and
degree
and
it
is
the
most
comprehensible
thing
in
the
world
that
he
will
not
only
accept
all
tests
of
his
love
readily
but
will
go
forth
in
search
of
them
with
eager
alacrity
first
and
last
and
always
the
only
keen
satisfaction
of
great
love
whether
human
or
divine
is
to
welcome
opportunities
of
proving
itself
in
some
heroic
form
of
courage
and
endurance
danger
suffering
battling
against
odds
discouragement
overwork
pain
of
mind
and
body
failure
want
of
recognition
rebuffs
contempt
and
persecution
are
no
longer
the
subject
matter
of
a
stoicism
or
a
submissive
patience
but
rather
the
quickening
bread
and
wine
of
an
intense
and
life
this
is
why
the
saints
be
the
provocation
ever
so
great
never
develop
nerves
or
experience
those
melancholy
and
humiliating
reactions
which
are
the
natural
of
spiritual
energies
this
is
why
saints
can
fast
and
keep
their
temper
sweet
can
wear
without
cultivating
wry
faces
can
be
passed
by
in
the
distribution
of
honors
without
being
soured
can
pray
all
night
without
robbing
the
day
of
its
due
meed
of
cheerfulness
can
rise
superior
to
frailties
and
weaknesses
without
despising
those
who
can
not
can
be
serious
without
being
testy
and
morose
can
live
for
years
in
a
cell
or
a
desert
or
a
without
perishing
of
ennui
or
being
devoured
by
restlessness
and
can
mingle
with
life
where
all
its
currents
meet
without
losing
their
heads
or
swerving
a
hairbreadth
from
the
straight
line
of
a
most
uncommon
and
most
impressive
kind
of
common
sense
unless
we
keep
before
our
eyes
this
mainspring
of
a
saint
life
that
life
will
be
as
enigmatical
to
us
as
it
is
to
the
world
jesus
balked
at
no
test
of
the
love
which
he
bore
towards
us
nay
he
devised
tests
passing
all
human
imagining
let
him
make
trial
of
our
love
for
him
we
are
unhappy
till
he
does
and
with
this
daring
spirit
in
his
heart
every
saint
enters
upon
a
career
of
romance
in
its
sweetest
and
highest
form
and
we
submit
to
recur
to
the
literary
style
of
the
following
biography
romance
is
cheerful
with
the
starlight
on
its
face

in
its
eyes

chapter
i
on
the
road
in
vienna
the
year
when
shakespeare
was
still
a
little
boy
twenty
years
before
philip
ii
fitted
out
the
spanish
armada
forty
years
before
the
first
english
colony
settled
in
america
the
sun
had
just
well
risen
the
gates
of
vienna
had
been
opened
but
a
few
hours
through
the
great
western
gate
which
cast
its
long
shadow
on
the
road
to
augsburg
came
a
boy
he
lacked
but
a
month
or
two
of
seventeen
years
was
some
five
feet
two
or
three
inches
in
height
had
an
oval
face
of
remarkable
beauty
and
liveliness
jet
black
hair
and
eyes
in
which
merriment
dwelt
as
in
its
home
he
was
dressed
as
became
a
noble
of
the
time
and
in
apparel
of
unusual
splendor
and
costliness
plumed
bonnet
slashed
velvet
doublet
tight
silken
hose
jeweled
dagger
at
his
girdle
but
it
was
odd
to
see
so
brilliant
a
figure
on
foot
in
the
dusty
highway
still
more
odd
that
be
carried
a
rough
bundle
slung
on
a
staff
over
his
and
that
peasant
fashion
he
munched
at
a
loaf
of
bread
as
he
trudged
the
road
by
no
means
still
he
swung
along
with
an
easy
stride
and
a
confident
strength
that
many
a
stouter
man
might
envy
he
was
bound
for
augsburg
miles
to
the
west
and
he
set
himself
thirty
miles
a
day
as
his
rate
of
travel
he
wore
splendid
clothes
because
he
was
stanislaus
the
son
of
john
kostka
lord
of
kostkov
senator
and
castellan
of
zakroczym
in
the
duchy
of
mazovia
poland
he
ate
his
rough
breakfast
like
a
peasant
on
the
road
because
he
had
just
been
to
mass
and
received
holy
communion
at
the
jesuit
church
in
vienna
he
carried
a
bundle
on
his
staff
because
he
laughed
merrily
at
fine
clothes
and
had
in
the
bundle
a
coarse
tunic
and
a
stout
pair
of
brogans
which
he
meant
to
put
on
as
soon
as
he
got
well
out
of
the
city
and
his
face
and
his
eyes
shone
with
joy
because
he
loved
god
most
wonderfully
and
was
as
happy
a
boy
as
ever
moved
through
this
dull
world
every
age
has
its
adventurers
men
who
for
fame
or
for
place
or
for
money
cross
wide
seas
fight
brave
battles
endure
great
hardships
the
age
in
which
stanislaus
lived
was
filled
with
them
all
the
world
reads
with
delight
the
story
of
such
men
and
every
decent
boy
who
reads
feels
himself
if
only
for
the
moment
their
fellow
in
spirit
eager
to
do
what
they
did
and
as
bravely
as
they
did
but
was
there
ever
adventure
finer
than
this
ever
spirit
more
gayly
daring
stanislaus
kostka
son
of
a
noble
house
a
boy
in
years
starting
without
a
copper
in
his
pocket
to
cross
half
of
europe
afoot
and
for
what
not
to
have
men
say
what
a
brave
chap
he
was
not
to
win
a
name
or
rank
or
money
but
because
god
would
be
pleased
by
his
doing
it
because
god
called
him
to
do
something
which
he
could
not
do
in
vienna
he
felt
he
had
a
vocation
to
be
a
jesuit
he
knew
his
father
would
not
consent
he
took
six
months
to
think
it
over
to
pray
for
light
to
make
sure
it
was
no
mere
whim
or
fancy
of
his
own
but
the
very
voice
of
god
and
when
he
felt
sure
he
left
a
letter
for
his
brother
paul
and
his
tutor
bilinski
with
whom
he
had
been
studying
in
vienna
he
gave
his
money
to
a
couple
of
beggars
he
said
if
god
wants
me
to
do
this
he
furnish
the
means
he
put
on
his
best
attire
tied
up
a
rough
suit
in
a
cloth
took
a
stout
staff
in
his
hand
and
with
god
blessing
upon
him
and
his
eucharistic
presence
in
his
heart
stepped
out
cheerfully
on
a
journey
that
would
stagger
most
men
that
is
the
stuff
of
which
heroes
are
made
if
stanislaus
had
done
this
for
the
glory
of
the
world
we
should
have
his
praises
in
our
histories
we
should
have
stories
woven
about
him
the
whole
world
would
cry
bravo
but
he
did
it
for
god
and
the
world
can
not
understand
him
at
all
the
world
is
silent
an
hour
or
so
of
that
steady
tireless
stride
carried
him
well
away
from
vienna
he
slipped
off
his
velvet
and
silk
put
on
his
coarse
tunic
a
garment
that
came
below
his
knees
girded
himself
with
a
bit
of
rope
tied
his
stout
shoes
on
his
feet
and
took
the
road
again
there
were
folk
aplenty
journeying
from
the
countryside
to
vienna
in
the
early
morning
stanislaus
picked
out
one
of
the
peasants
and
handed
him
the
gala
dress
he
had
just
taken
off
i
ca
carry
these
with
me
friend
he
said
wo
you
please
take
them
i
have
no
use
for
them
and
perhaps
you
can
sell
them
in
the
city
and
he
was
gone
before
the
peasant
gaping
in
wonder
at
the
rich
garments
and
dagger
in
his
hands
could
much
more
than
catch
a
glimpse
of
that
bright
face
and
those
laughing
eyes
he
tramped
all
day
and
made
his
thirty
miles
when
he
was
hungry
he
asked
some
one
he
met
for
food
it
is
not
likely
that
any
one
would
refuse
the
smiling
handsome
boy
from
whose
face
innocence
simply
shone
but
if
any
one
had
refused
him
it
would
not
have
annoyed
stanislaus
his
good
humor
came
from
heaven
as
well
as
from
his
own
cheery
soul
and
you
can
not
rebuff
that
kind
of
good
humor
night
came
down
at
last
and
he
was
tired
out
he
came
to
an
inn
and
asked
for
shelter
i
have
no
money
he
told
the
landlord
smiling
and
i
have
no
claim
upon
you
will
you
take
me
in
the
landlord
looked
at
him
shrewdly
a
little
then
said
with
respect
but
what
is
your
grace
doing
in
such
a
garb
stanislaus
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
was
recognized
but
he
put
on
a
bold
front
and
laughed
as
he
said
i
am
not
grace
i
am
what
you
see
me
and
i
have
a
long
journey
to
make
in
those
days
it
was
not
unusual
for
even
nobles
to
go
roughly
clad
upon
pilgrimages
of
devotion
that
stanislaus
was
a
noble
the
landlord
was
quite
certain
that
he
might
be
engaged
on
some
such
pious
business
was
possible
but
who
ever
heard
of
a
mere
boy
going
upon
pilgrimage
the
whole
affair
puzzled
the
landlord
more
than
a
little
however
the
face
of
the
boy
reassured
him
at
least
there
could
be
no
evil
behind
that
frank
brave
countenance
so
he
shook
his
head
saying
i
do
not
understand
but
come
in
you
are
welcome
he
gave
stanislaus
his
supper
and
a
bed
to
sleep
in
you
shall
not
be
the
poorer
for
this
said
stanislaus
as
he
thanked
him
you
know
god
makes
it
up
to
us
for
even
a
cup
of
cold
water
given
in
his
name
and
as
the
boy
spoke
the
landlord
saw
his
face
glow
when
he
spoke
of
god
and
he
was
very
glad
at
heart
that
he
had
given
shelter
and
food
to
this
strange
boy
stanislaus
slept
soundly
but
he
was
up
with
the
sun
washed
and
dressed
quickly
and
went
to
thank
his
host
again
before
setting
out
but
you
will
have
something
to
eat
before
you
go
cried
the
man
as
stanislaus
stood
before
him
staff
in
hand
ready
for
the
road
it
is
good
of
you
to
offer
it
the
boy
answered
but
perhaps
i
shall
find
a
church
before
long
and
i
must
go
fasting
to
holy
communion
then
the
landlord
marvelled
again
for
at
that
period
even
good
people
did
not
go
very
often
to
holy
communion
especially
when
they
were
traveling
hard
as
stanislaus
evidently
was
and
his
admiration
and
liking
grew
for
this
boy
with
the
merry
face
and
the
heart
so
near
heaven
at
least
he
said
you
must
take
something
with
you
for
the
way
and
that
stanislaus
did
not
refuse
but
accepted
gratefully
and
so
parted
from
the
kind
landlord
leaving
him
gazing
in
the
doorway
with
wonder
in
his
eyes
his
legs
were
a
bit
stiff
and
sore
this
second
day
but
the
first
few
miles
wore
that
off
and
he
swung
on
his
way
as
bravely
and
gayly
as
before
chapter
ii
the
pursuit
meanwhile
there
was
a
hubbub
in
vienna
stanislaus
had
lived
in
that
city
about
three
years
with
his
brother
paul
who
was
about
a
year
older
than
he
and
in
the
care
of
a
tutor
a
young
man
named
bilinski
he
had
left
them
in
the
early
morning
as
the
day
wore
on
and
he
did
not
return
home
they
became
uneasy
they
went
about
all
afternoon
inquiring
amongst
their
friends
and
acquaintance
if
any
had
seen
him
only
one
or
two
were
in
the
secret
and
they
kept
discreet
silence
unable
therefore
to
get
any
trace
of
stanislaus
they
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
fled
and
as
we
shall
see
they
had
good
reason
in
their
own
hearts
for
guessing
that
from
the
first
they
returned
to
the
house
of
the
senator
kimberker
where
they
were
all
lodging
and
taking
kimberker
who
was
a
lutheran
into
their
confidence
they
held
a
council
of
war
it
was
decided
that
stanislaus
must
have
gone
to
augsburg
paul
recalled
something
that
stanislaus
had
said
to
him
only
the
day
before
when
he
had
threatened
plainly
to
run
away
and
they
had
heard
him
say
another
time
that
at
augsburg
was
peter
canisius
the
provincial
of
the
german
jesuits
of
course
they
were
going
to
follow
him
and
bring
him
back
but
night
had
come
on
before
their
inquiries
and
deliberations
were
finished
they
must
wait
till
the
next
day
accordingly
bright
and
early
the
following
morning
all
three
with
one
of
the
kostkas
servants
drove
out
in
a
carriage
over
the
augsburg
road
they
had
four
good
horses
and
they
told
their
coachman
not
to
spare
the
whip
they
came
to
the
inn
where
stanislaus
had
spent
the
night
they
questioned
the
landlord
have
you
seen
a
boy
of
seventeen
a
polish
noble
pass
westward
along
this
road
yesterday
or
today
but
the
landlord
was
shrewd
and
though
the
whole
matter
was
beyond
him
he
fancied
somehow
that
these
eager
folk
were
no
great
friends
of
the
boy
who
had
lodged
with
him
and
as
he
trusted
that
boy
and
could
scarcely
help
being
loyal
to
him
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
answered
how
should
i
know
so
many
travel
this
road
then
bilinski
described
stanislaus
and
his
doublet
of
velvet
and
hose
of
silk
and
jeweled
dagger
but
at
that
the
landlord
shook
his
head
in
denial
i
have
seen
no
such
person
as
your
graces
describe
he
said
bilinski
called
out
to
the
coachman
drive
on
we
have
nothing
to
learn
here
but
paul
said
nq
let
us
turn
back
he
can
not
have
walked
this
far
in
one
day
we
must
have
passed
him
on
the
road
perhaps
you
could
not
have
walked
so
far
said
bilinski
with
a
sneer
but
stanislaus
could
drive
on
forty
miles
or
more
out
of
vienna
they
saw
a
boy
trudging
ahead
of
them
in
a
rough
tunic
with
a
staff
in
his
hand
at
the
noise
of
the
hurrying
wheels
the
boy
glanced
back
then
quickly
turned
up
a
lane
which
there
entered
the
road
he
did
not
look
in
the
least
like
a
nobleman
son
and
the
carriage
passed
the
bottom
of
the
lane
without
so
much
as
slacking
speed
stanislaus
ran
up
the
lane
until
he
came
to
where
it
ended
at
a
rough
brawling
stream
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
put
off
his
shoes
tucked
up
his
tunic
and
began
wading
in
the
course
of
the
stream
the
water
was
cold
the
sharp
stones
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
bruised
his
feet
at
any
moment
he
might
fall
into
a
deep
hole
and
be
drowned
but
he
splashed
and
stumbled
ahead
as
fast
as
he
could
go
praying
to
his
guardian
angel
to
have
care
of
him
a
little
farther
he
knew
the
highway
crossed
this
stream
by
a
bridge
and
there
he
could
leave
the
water
and
regain
the
road
the
carriage
meantime
kept
on
and
came
to
this
bridge
but
paul
had
been
thinking
of
the
young
fellow
who
took
to
the
lane
when
he
saw
the
carriage
approach
and
a
shrewd
suspicion
came
into
his
head
did
you
see
that
boy
who
ran
up
the
lane
he
cried
at
length
to
bilinski
i
believe
it
was
stanislaus
but
he
was
dressed
like
a
peasant
said
bilinski
and
stanislaus
had
on
a
handsome
suit
they
debated
for
a
time
but
paul
prevailed
round
they
turned
and
drove
furiously
back
to
the
lane
but
as
the
driver
tried
to
turn
his
horses
into
it
the
animals
reared
and
balked
and
refused
to
enter
blows
and
curses
were
showered
on
them
they
merely
stood
and
trembled
no
efforts
could
urge
them
into
the
lane
then
the
driver
grew
afraid
and
cried
out
my
lord
paul
we
can
not
go
into
this
lane
and
before
god
i
have
fear
upon
me
never
have
the
horses
acted
this
way
and
indeed
fear
seized
them
all
they
saw
the
hand
of
god
in
this
strange
obstinancy
of
their
beasts
even
kimberker
cried
the
pursuit
fear
god
he
said
for
this
is
no
common
mishap
and
when
they
turned
the
horses
heads
again
toward
vienna
the
animals
snorted
and
pranced
and
went
very
willingly
and
so
when
stanislaus
came
to
the
bridge
the
highway
was
clear
after
a
look
about
he
put
on
his
shoes
gripped
his
staff
afresh
and
took
up
again
cheerily
as
ever
his
thirty
miles
a
day
to
augsburg
day
after
day
tired
and
footsore
he
told
off
the
long
miles
begging
his
food
and
lodging
as
he
went
fearless
and
happy
praying
like
an
angel
of
god
as
he
walked
along
many
were
kind
to
him
for
the
brave
bright
spirit
that
shone
out
in
his
face
many
remembered
those
words
of
our
lord
whatsoever
you
have
done
unto
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
you
have
done
it
unto
me
and
willingly
sheltered
the
boy
and
gave
him
to
eat
sometimes
he
turned
into
the
fields
beside
the
road
and
slept
through
the
warm
august
night
beneath
the
open
sky
whenever
he
came
to
a
church
in
the
morning
he
heard
mass
and
received
holy
communion
for
he
started
out
each
morning
fasting
and
on
the
fourteenth
day
he
reached
augsburg
what
happened
there
we
shall
see
in
another
chapter
and
how
within
three
weeks
this
smiling
boy
turned
his
face
southward
and
tramped
another
eight
hundred
miles
on
foot
to
rome
but
just
that
will
show
you
something
of
the
spirit
of
stanislaus
the
spirit
of
a
hero
all
that
a
knight
might
do
out
of
love
for
his
lady
he
did
out
of
love
for
god
he
really
loved
god
with
a
sort
of
fierce
intensity
and
he
wanted
to
show
his
love
in
deeds
just
as
we
want
to
show
our
love
for
a
person
by
doing
something
by
giving
something
god
had
given
him
everything
he
would
give
god
everything
that
was
the
whole
of
his
life
and
with
that
generosity
went
a
fine
common
sense
he
was
not
rash
or
headlong
acting
first
and
thinking
afterward
he
reckoned
things
out
calmly
and
sensibly
and
then
went
ahead
with
a
pluck
and
determination
that
nothing
in
the
world
could
stop
god
asked
a
fearfully
hard
thing
of
him
to
leave
his
people
his
home
to
set
out
afoot
on
an
enormous
journey
to
undergo
no
end
of
hardships
and
humiliations
to
live
in
a
strange
land
among
strange
people
and
he
did
it
did
it
smilingly
joyfully
with
a
simple
quiet
bravery
seldom
if
ever
matched
by
any
other
boy
in
the
world
the
one
thing
that
staggers
us
is
his
reason
for
doing
it
his
great
love
for
god
and
that
is
because
we
have
not
got
what
we
could
easily
get
his
secret
he
prayed
he
kept
close
in
thought
to
god
always
god
and
heaven
and
our
lady
were
as
familiar
to
his
mind
as
the
sun
and
the
earth
and
the
air
are
to
our
mind
the
earth
to
him
was
only
the
antechamber
of
heaven
he
looked
upon
life
as
one
looks
upon
a
little
delay
at
a
railway
station
before
the
train
leaves
the
only
important
thing
is
to
catch
the
train
chapter
iii
early
days
bilinski
and
paul
kostka
went
back
to
vienna
much
troubled
at
heart
they
really
loved
stanislaus
for
one
thing
though
they
had
been
pretty
rough
with
him
and
for
another
they
had
to
face
the
anger
of
the
lord
john
kostka
when
he
should
hear
of
flight
shortly
after
they
had
got
back
a
young
friend
of
the
runaway
came
to
them
and
said
if
you
look
between
the
leaves
of
a
book
you
will
find
a
letter
which
stanislaus
left
for
you
they
looked
and
found
the
letter
it
was
very
simple
and
straightforward
a
genuine
boy
letter
he
had
run
away
he
said
because
he
had
to
he
was
called
to
enter
the
society
of
jesus
he
had
to
do
what
god
wanted
of
him
he
knew
they
would
prevent
him
if
they
could
and
so
he
just
went
he
left
them
messages
of
affectionate
regard
and
begged
them
to
forward
his
letter
to
his
father
bilinski
sent
this
letter
on
at
once
paul
also
wrote
as
did
kimberker
and
even
the
servant
who
had
gone
with
them
in
the
carriage
each
tried
to
shift
the
blame
from
himself
told
of
the
strange
behavior
of
the
horses
explained
that
everything
possible
had
been
done
to
overtake
the
fugitive
and
when
their
letters
came
there
was
high
wrath
in
kostkov
the
lord
john
raved
and
swore
he
blamed
everybody
but
most
of
all
stanislaus
and
the
tricky
jesuits
who
he
said
were
back
of
the
whole
scheme
he
wrote
to
cardinal
osius
that
he
would
not
rest
until
he
had
broken
up
the
jesuit
college
in
pultowa
and
driven
every
schemer
of
them
out
of
poland
as
for
stanislaus
he
would
follow
him
across
the
world
if
need
were
and
drag
him
back
to
kostkov
in
chains
he
was
a
great
lord
the
lord
john
he
loved
his
second
son
stanislaus
most
dearly
and
he
loved
dearly
the
honor
of
his
house
which
he
thought
that
son
had
stained
by
hi
conduct
a
son
of
his
in
beggar
garb
tramping
the
highways
of
europe
begging
his
bread
from
door
to
door
it
nearly
broke
his
heart
he
had
princely
blood
in
his
veins
he
was
a
senator
of
poland
he
might
even
become
a
king
his
dearest
hopes
were
in
stanislaus
his
second
son
paul
the
eldest
was
wild
and
unsteady
and
though
there
were
two
other
sons
and
a
daughter
none
gave
such
promise
as
stanislaus
so
that
the
lord
john
looked
chiefly
to
him
to
carry
on
the
great
name
and
make
it
more
glorious
still
no
wonder
he
raged
stanislaus
had
figured
all
that
out
beforehand
it
hurt
him
too
hurt
terribly
but
what
can
one
do
when
god
calls
god
had
made
all
the
kostkas
given
them
name
and
rank
god
was
the
lord
of
lords
it
was
to
stanislaus
to
leave
his
father
in
anger
yet
he
trusted
that
since
that
was
god
will
well
god
would
find
a
way
to
bring
peace
out
of
all
this
trouble
he
put
all
his
fears
and
heartache
away
from
him
and
went
out
to
do
what
god
wanted
he
had
always
done
that
even
when
he
was
a
little
tad
in
the
rough
castle
at
kostkov
god
had
taught
him
god
had
helped
him
wonderfully
but
more
wonderful
still
to
our
eyes
is
the
way
the
boy
listened
to
god
teaching
and
obeyed
it
we
think
things
come
easy
to
the
saints
we
read
or
hear
of
wonders
in
their
lives
which
are
evidently
god
doing
and
we
say
of
course
the
saint
was
good
and
holy
but
it
was
all
done
for
him
god
made
everything
smooth
the
saint
was
never
in
my
boots
for
a
minute
and
all
the
time
we
forget
the
things
which
the
saint
himself
did
the
superb
efforts
he
had
to
make
so
stanislaus
began
to
pray
as
soon
as
he
well
began
to
speak
do
you
think
he
would
not
sooner
have
kept
on
with
his
play
do
you
think
he
did
not
naturally
hate
the
effort
just
as
any
boy
naturally
hates
effort
he
lived
amongst
rough
men
men
used
to
the
ways
of
camps
and
the
speech
of
soldiers
yet
he
not
merely
kept
his
own
lips
clean
but
he
shrank
as
from
a
blow
from
every
coarse
or
indecent
speech
in
others
he
did
not
go
around
correcting
people
he
was
too
sensible
for
that
he
was
not
a
prig
or
a
prude
but
he
knew
as
we
know
that
vile
speech
is
hateful
to
god
and
as
so
many
of
us
do
not
do
he
set
his
face
against
it
did
that
cost
him
no
effort
had
he
no
human
respect
to
fight
against
think
of
how
many
times
you
may
have
grinned
cowardly
at
a
gross
remark
or
shady
story
of
a
comrade
because
you
were
not
fighter
enough
to
resent
it
and
then
give
this
stanislaus
who
did
resent
credit
for
his
stouter
courage
his
more
manly
spirit
his
biographers
tell
us
that
he
was
simply
free
from
temptations
against
purity
that
does
not
mean
what
many
may
think
it
means
that
he
was
physically
unlike
other
boys
that
he
had
no
animal
desires
that
he
had
nothing
to
fight
against
it
means
that
he
was
such
a
magnificent
fighter
that
he
had
won
the
battle
almost
from
the
start
it
means
that
he
was
not
content
as
so
many
of
us
are
with
merely
pushing
a
temptation
a
little
aside
and
then
looking
around
in
surprise
to
find
it
still
there
he
was
like
a
skillful
boxer
who
wards
off
every
blow
of
his
adversary
so
that
he
goes
through
the
contest
absolutely
untouched
he
watched
as
we
are
too
lazy
to
watch
he
kept
out
of
danger
where
we
foolishly
run
into
it
he
did
not
wait
until
temptation
had
set
upon
him
and
nearly
battered
him
down
before
he
began
to
resist
he
saw
it
coming
afar
off
just
as
we
can
if
we
look
out
and
he
met
it
with
a
rush
that
sent
it
again
beyond
reach
or
even
sight
of
course
he
was
the
same
as
other
boys
of
course
he
had
the
same
inclinations
the
same
promptings
of
the
animal
man
but
with
them
he
had
more
daring
more
force
and
energy
of
will
to
cooperate
with
god
grace

always
find
it
that
way
the
things
the
saints
seem
to
do
with
ease
are
terrifically
hard
things
huge
battles
regular
slugging
fights
the
ease
if
there
be
any
is
not
in
the
things
they
did
but
in
the
men
who
did
them
you
have
seen
skilled
pianists
sit
down
at
their
instruments
and
run
off
into
brisk
flowing
music
what
looks
like
a
hopeless
jumble
of
notes
you
may
have
seen
an
artist
sketch
in
whilst
chatting
idly
a
swift
striking
portrait
well
all
really
good
men
are
artists
too
artists
in
fighting
and
stanislaus
was
one
of
the
cleverest
and
strongest
artists
of
the
lot
he
began
early
just
as
the
musician
mozart
did
just
as
the
painter
raffaele
did
and
he
studied
hard
at
his
art
just
as
all
great
artists
have
done
he
began
by
saying
his
prayers
well
not
mere
lip
prayers
but
heart
prayers
he
began
by
getting
on
easy
terms
with
god
with
our
lord
in
the
blessed
sacrament
with
our
blessed
lady
he
learned
to
talk
with
them
as
we
learn
to
talk
with
our
fathers
and
mothers
he
told
them
his
troubles
his
plans
he
talked
everything
over
with
them
and
it
no
more
made
him
queer
or
stiff
or
unpleasant
than
talking
things
over
with
your
comrades
or
your
parents
makes
you
queer
or
stiff
or
unpleasant
if
you
believe
in
god
it
is
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
try
to
take
him
into
your
confidence
then
it
is
easy
to
see
how
as
stanislaus
grew
older
he
liked
to
pray
he
liked
to
talk
about
god
and
our
lady
you
see
he
had
grown
to
know
them
they
were
not
remote
far
away
they
were
as
near
to
him
as
his
own
folk
they
were
his
own
folk
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
keeping
in
god
sight
all
the
time
he
kept
his
soul
clean
and
his
heart
merry
chapter
iv
off
to
vienna
in
this
way
stanislaus
went
on
until
he
was
nearly
fourteen
years
old
and
his
brother
paul
was
approaching
fifteen
then
the
lord
john
kostka
thought
his
boys
had
better
continue
their
studies
not
at
home
but
at
a
regular
school
he
picked
out
john
bilinski
a
young
man
who
had
lately
completed
his
college
course
as
tutor
for
them
he
gave
them
a
couple
of
servants
mounted
them
all
on
good
horses
and
sent
them
off
six
hundred
miles
or
more
on
horseback
to
vienna
you
may
be
sure
stanislaus
enjoyed
the
long
ride
it
would
be
strange
if
he
a
nobleman
of
the
finest
cavalry
nation
in
the
world
were
not
a
good
horseman
he
loved
the
smell
of
the
open
fields
he
loved
the
boisterous
song
of
the
mountain
torrent
the
hills
and
the
plains
were
his
home
for
the
hills
and
the
plains
were
nearer
to
god
than
the
houses
of
men
in
those
days
all
travel
was
on
foot
or
on
horseback
the
wealthy
and
noble
rode
the
poor
footed
it
great
highways
cut
europe
from
end
to
end
though
there
were
tracts
in
stanislaus
country
where
the
roadway
was
only
the
broad
steppe
where
the
grasses
waved
and
tossed
like
the
sea
where
men
were
few
and
their
dwellings
scattered
far
apart
they
crossed
great
rivers
they
climbed
the
foothills
of
the
carpathian
mountains
many
a
night
paul
and
stanislaus
with
their
people
slept
under
the
stars
many
a
wild
rough
border
town
they
passed
many
a
great
forest
they
penetrated
the
home
of
the
wild
boar
and
the
aurochs
and
the
tar
burners
in
the
forests
looked
up
from
under
their
matted
brows
at
the
fair
oval
face
of
the
polish
boy
and
said
he
is
like
a
wild
flower
blown
by
the
wind
he
is
like
the
violets
that
laugh
in
spring
at
the
sun
and
the
shaggy
of
the
frontier
villages
watched
him
ride
through
their
streets
and
thought
this
is
an
angel
he
looks
toward
heaven
because
he
sees
his
brothers
there
they
crossed
themselves
piously
as
he
passed
and
some
of
the
light
and
laughter
of
his
face
glowed
a
moment
in
their
dark
lives
as
a
gloomy
glen
in
the
forest
is
brightened
up
by
a
darting
ray
of
sunlight
he
was
wonderful
but
he
was
always
a
boy
he
was
glad
to
feel
the
good
horse
under
him
to
grip
the
tartar
saddle
with
his
knees
to
feel
the
air
rush
by
his
cheek
sometimes
they
met
poor
people
staggering
wearily
afoot
along
the
road
often
stanislaus
checked
his
horse
and
lightly
dismounted
get
up
get
up
old
father
he
would
cry
my
legs
are
stiff
from
the
saddle
i
want
to
walk
and
though
a
peasant
might
often
be
afraid
to
accept
the
favor
from
a
noble
or
be
surly
and
churlish
the
folk
never
were
so
with
stanislaus
up
climbed
the
old
father
into
the
saddle
and
stanislaus
stepped
out
by
his
side
god
give
your
grace
long
years
said
the
thankful
old
man
long
years
cried
stanislaus
i
want
more
than
that
i
want
eternity
i
was
born
for
greater
things
than
long
years
and
the
old
man
would
understand
for
he
was
of
the
poor
and
the
poor
know
more
of
this
longing
for
heaven
than
do
the
rich
but
he
looked
almost
with
awe
at
this
richly
dressed
noble
boy
who
had
learned
even
now
to
value
life
so
justly
then
it
was
easy
for
stanislaus
to
talk
of
heaven
to
the
old
man
old
father
in
the
barony
of
the
lord
jesus
there
is
no
poverty
or
old
age
or
weariness
nor
is
there
any
difference
of
rank
there
as
here
for
we
shall
all
be
great
lords
and
castellans
in
heaven
aye
but
your
grace
will
be
a
hetman
surely
in
the
army
of
the
lord
jesus
said
the
old
man
who
knows
cried
stanislaus
i
should
love
that
dearly
though
the
generals
in
his
kingdom
are
not
always
from
amongst
the
nobles
it
may
be
that
you
will
be
hetman
and
i
a
common
soldier
but
it
is
good
to
be
even
a
common
soldier
with
him
i
went
against
the
tartars
in
my
youth
said
the
old
man
perhaps
we
shall
have
a
campaign
against
that
lucifer
and
saint
michael
and
saint
wenceslaus
will
lead
us
under
the
lord
jesus
and
our
lady
of
yasna
gora
will
look
on
when
we
come
back
victorious
and
so
they
talked
on
until
it
was
time
to
set
the
old
man
down
and
stanislaus
mounted
again
to
catch
up
with
his
party
which
had
gone
ahead
with
god
cried
the
old
man
with
god
echoed
stanislaus
if
you
go
to
heaven
before
me
father
do
not
forget
to
plead
for
me
with
the
lord
jesus
and
with
his
mother
then
he
clattered
along
the
road
and
shortly
came
up
with
bilinski
and
paul
sometimes
they
came
to
districts
infested
by
robbers
and
waited
to
join
themselves
to
some
larger
party
for
protection
sometimes
they
made
long
stretches
of
many
hours
in
the
saddle
when
the
inns
were
far
apart
and
they
could
get
no
food
on
the
road
sometimes
they
tarried
a
day
or
two
in
a
little
town
to
rest
their
horses
but
everywhere
stanislaus
thought
of
god
and
prayed
and
when
occasion
offered
spoke
of
holy
things
as
only
he
could
speak
bilinski
and
paul
often
laughed
at
him
for
they
were
of
a
different
stamp
but
he
did
not
mind
their
ridicule
and
he
bore
them
no
grudge
for
it
and
so
after
many
days
they
came
at
length
to
vienna
on
july
chapter
v
school
days
vienna
was
a
great
city
even
in
those
days
since
for
a
long
time
it
had
been
the
residence
of
the
roman
emperors
of
the
west
it
was
a
catholic
city
though
even
in
little
more
than
forty
years
after
luther
revolt
the
lutherans
in
the
city
had
begun
to
be
quite
numerous
the
society
of
jesus
had
been
founded
in
only
ten
years
before
stanislaus
was
born
but
it
had
spread
quickly
for
some
years
now
there
had
been
a
jesuit
house
in
vienna
in
four
years
before
stanislaus
came
to
vienna
the
emperor
ferdinand
i
had
loaned
to
the
viennese
jesuits
a
large
house
next
to
their
own
which
they
might
use
as
a
college
the
fathers
built
a
connection
between
the
two
houses
so
that
they
became
practically
one
here
they
received
boys
from
the
city
from
the
country
round
about
even
from
hungary
and
far
poland
here
stanislaus
took
up
his
residence
it
was
a
simpler
less
formal
sort
of
school
than
we
perhaps
are
accustomed
to
the
fathers
and
the
boys
lived
together
almost
as
one
big
family
they
ate
together
in
one
large
dining
hall
there
were
always
some
of
the
fathers
with
the
boys
in
their
games
as
well
as
in
their
studies
it
was
a
very
pleasant
place
and
a
very
good
place
in
those
early
days
of
protestantism
catholics
even
catholic
boys
felt
that
they
were
in
a
fighting
situation
the
attacks
upon
the
old
faith
woke
new
courage
and
devotion
in
those
who
remained
faithful
to
the
church
of
the
ages
and
so
filled
with
that
spirit
of
loyalty
that
new
earnestness
which
the
times
called
forth
and
living
under
the
example
of
the
simple
manly
piety
of
their
jesuit
teachers
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
boys
in
the
college
of
vienna
were
an
unusually
good
set
of
boys
they
had
their
regular
classes
in
languages
mathematics
and
such
science
as
the
age
knew
latin
was
then
the
language
of
all
educated
people
in
europe
the
language
of
courts
the
common
meeting
ground
of
all
nations
many
a
time
both
in
those
days
and
later
a
noble
proved
his
rank
and
saved
himself
from
mischance
by
the
mere
fact
that
he
spoke
latin
it
was
not
a
dead
language
then
as
it
is
now
it
was
in
current
use
greek
was
comparatively
new
in
western
schools
and
though
from
their
beginnings
the
jesuits
were
famous
teachers
we
can
hardly
suppose
that
in
their
new
and
small
college
at
vienna
the
boys
were
much
troubled
by
the
speech
of
plato
and
demosthenes
of
their
games
it
is
hard
to
know
much
at
this
late
day
and
bouts
of
a
soldierly
sort
were
common
enough
these
boys
were
almost
all
of
noble
birth
most
of
them
perhaps
looked
to
the
army
for
their
profession
so
they
held
mimic
tournaments
and
played
games
in
which
they
hurled
lances
through
suspended
rings
they
shot
with
bows
and
arrows
and
of
course
they
had
matches
in
running
jumping
and
wrestling
we
know
that
stanislaus
did
uncommonly
well
in
the
schools
he
was
quick
had
a
good
memory
and
was
too
sensible
to
be
lazy
and
though
the
writers
of
his
life
say
nothing
about
it
we
are
quite
sure
that
he
excelled
in
games
and
sports
also
for
one
thing
he
as
a
general
favorite
esteemed
by
all
his
fellows
and
that
must
mean
that
he
was
one
with
them
in
their
play
for
another
he
was
naturally
no
dreamer
or
moper
but
the
jolliest
cheeriest
sort
of
boy
and
finally
the
boy
who
walked
twelve
hundred
miles
in
a
few
weeks
must
have
been
well
accustomed
to
using
his
legs
try
thirty
miles
a
day
on
foot
day
after
day
you
football
players
and
baseball
players
you
trained
athletes
and
say
whether
it
is
the
work
of
a
weakling
or
of
a
boy
who
never
played
but
it
takes
more
than
success
in
studies
and
in
games
to
account
for
his
great
popularity
with
the
other
college
boys
such
success
may
win
a
certain
admiration
and
respect
but
it
does
not
of
itself
win
friends
and
stanislaus
had
pretty
nearly
every
one
for
his
friend
to
do
that
requires
other
gifts
gifts
of
character
everybody
liked
him
because
he
had
such
gifts
he
was
pious
but
not
merely
pious
much
more
than
pious
he
was
good
that
means
he
was
unselfish
there
is
only
one
way
to
make
people
really
love
you
and
that
is
to
love
them
that
is
what
stanislaus
did
he
loved
the
people
he
lived
with
he
was
naturally
good
hearted
and
big
hearted
he
had
kept
away
from
petty
meannesses
he
had
fought
down
his
natural
selfishness
he
had
learned
not
to
be
always
seeking
his
own
little
advantage
not
to
put
himself
forward
for
praise
not
to
insist
on
his
rights
not
to
boast
and
carry
a
high
hand
with
his
comrades
not
to
talk
a
lot
about
himself
he
had
learned
to
forgive
little
offenses
and
big
ones
too
for
that
matter
he
knew
all
about
how
our
lord
had
suffered
and
put
up
with
things
and
forgiven
those
who
hurt
him
and
he
loved
our
lord
so
much
was
so
much
at
home
with
him
that
almost
without
effort
he
acted
as
our
lord
would
want
him
to
act
he
had
plenty
of
spirit
and
a
whole
world
of
pluck
and
daring
but
he
was
not
quarrelsome
then
he
was
as
cheerful
as
sunshine
and
he
made
every
one
else
cheerful
why
the
boys
could
not
help
loving
a
boy
like
him
sodalities
were
rare
in
those
days
but
the
college
boys
of
vienna
had
a
sodality
devoted
to
the
honor
of
our
lady
and
under
the
patronage
of
saint
barbara
at
their
meetings
the
sodalists
in
turn
had
to
address
their
companions
give
a
little
talk
about
the
blessed
virgin
or
on
some
virtue
or
the
like
whenever
stanislaus
turn
came
the
boys
were
all
expectation
he
was
no
older
than
most
of
them
indeed
younger
perhaps
but
he
had
an
older
head
he
had
done
more
thinking
than
they
and
a
deal
more
praying
he
had
no
false
shame
or
babyish
timidity
if
he
had
anything
to
say
he
was
not
afraid
to
say
it
and
he
certainly
had
something
to
say
it
had
come
to
be
as
easy
for
him
to
talk
about
our
lady
and
heaven
as
for
other
boys
to
talk
about
their
mothers
at
home
he
had
treasured
up
stories
of
the
blessed
virgin
help
with
which
catholic
poland
was
filled
he
spoke
simply
unaffectedly
of
our
lady
love
for
us
of
her
power
her
willingness
to
aid
us
and
from
him
though
simply
their
school
mate
the
boys
heard
these
things
eagerly
he
seemed
well
privileged
to
speak
as
indeed
he
was
to
talk
about
pious
things
and
do
it
acceptably
is
a
mighty
hard
matter
you
have
to
know
how
and
the
first
part
of
knowing
how
is
to
be
at
home
with
pious
things
to
have
thought
about
them
often
and
long
to
have
woven
them
into
your
life
as
stanislaus
had
done
the
trouble
with
us
is
that
we
live
so
far
removed
from
thoughts
of
god
of
his
mother
that
they
never
cease
to
be
strange
to
us
we
go
blunderingly
about
mention
of
them
or
we
lack
the
courage
to
speak
at
all
but
why
should
they
be
strange
or
remote
we
are
destined
to
live
forever
in
heaven
we
are
the
daily
recipients
of
favors
we
are
sheltered
protected
every
way
by
our
lady
loving
care
the
things
that
touch
us
most
nearly
are
the
things
of
the
spiritual
world
they
are
the
most
thrillingly
important
they
are
the
only
really
important
things
we
are
not
afraid
to
talk
baseball
or
politics
or
business
why
be
afraid
to
talk
of
god
power
his
dominion
over
us
his
love
for
us
our
duties
to
him
the
helps
he
gives
us
the
reward
he
holds
out
to
us
there
is
only
one
answer
we
do
think
enough
about
these
things
there
is
only
one
remedy
do
thing
about
them
as
saint
stanislaus
did
chapter
vi
in
the
house
of
kimberker
the
house
which
the
jesuits
in
vienna
used
for
their
boarding
college
was
not
theirs
it
belonged
to
the
emperor
ferdinand
i
who
had
merely
loaned
it
to
them
now
the
emperor
ferdinand
had
died
on
july
the
day
before
paul
and
stanislaus
came
to
vienna
the
new
emperor
maximilian
ii
left
the
house
with
the
jesuits
for
a
time
but
in
march
withdrew
it
from
their
use
of
course
that
meant
the
breaking
up
of
the
the
fathers
still
had
their
own
residence
and
they
could
teach
a
small
number
of
day
scholars
many
of
their
pupils
went
to
their
homes
when
they
could
no
longer
live
with
the
jesuits
those
who
remained
had
to
take
lodgings
elsewhere
in
the
city
it
was
decided
that
paul
and
stanislaus
should
be
amongst
the
latter
number
at
once
bilinski
set
out
with
the
two
to
get
a
house
in
the
platz
kiemark
a
fashionable
quarter
of
the
town
there
was
a
splendid
mansion
belonging
to
a
lutheran
noble
the
senator
kimberker
it
took
paul
fancy
immensely
on
inquiry
they
found
that
kimberker
used
less
than
half
of
the
house
for
it
was
a
huge
building
with
many
rooms
and
that
he
was
more
than
willing
to
rent
the
unused
rooms
to
the
young
poles
stanislaus
felt
a
little
ill
at
ease
over
living
with
a
lutheran
but
bilinski
and
paul
poohed
at
his
fears
and
had
their
own
way
in
the
matter
so
in
a
few
days
they
moved
in
and
fitted
up
a
couple
of
the
vacant
rooms
stanislaus
was
to
live
more
than
two
years
in
this
house
two
years
filled
with
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
and
pain
and
yet
blessed
in
wonderful
ways
his
difficulties
began
almost
at
once
and
they
were
no
slight
difficulties
of
course
he
and
paul
went
daily
for
classes
to
the
jesuits
house
and
met
daily
the
few
boys
who
continued
their
studies
in
vienna
but
the
old
companionship
the
old
life
of
the
boys
in
common
was
gone
only
two
or
three
of
his
best
friends
remained
and
these
were
scattered
through
the
city
he
saw
them
for
a
little
while
after
classes
he
might
now
and
then
go
out
with
them
on
a
holiday
but
for
the
most
part
he
was
thrown
back
upon
the
company
of
his
tutor
and
his
elder
brother
both
paul
and
bilinski
liked
a
good
time
they
were
far
removed
from
the
authority
of
home
bilinski
who
was
in
charge
was
only
a
few
years
older
than
paul
and
whilst
a
good
fellow
in
the
main
was
little
able
or
perhaps
little
willing
to
put
much
check
upon
him
and
paul
was
a
pretty
gay
blade
rough
boisterous
wild
in
manner
he
picked
companions
like
himself
kimberker
house
soon
became
a
noisy
place
there
were
dinners
at
which
the
wine
went
round
very
freely
plenty
of
cards
and
dice
now
and
then
brawling
quarrels
it
did
not
suit
stanislaus
at
all
he
was
too
much
of
a
gentleman
and
too
good
to
act
unpleasantly
or
resent
the
rough
company
that
paul
brought
home
but
he
could
not
mix
freely
with
them
he
did
not
like
their
talk
or
their
manners
and
he
slipped
quietly
away
from
their
noisy
gatherings
as
soon
as
he
decently
could
and
so
he
was
left
alone
and
lonesomeness
for
a
boy
of
fourteen
is
a
very
unpleasant
thing
he
still
did
well
in
his
classes
but
he
was
no
when
he
had
done
his
duty
in
study
the
books
had
no
further
claim
upon
him
and
no
attraction
in
themselves
and
yet
he
kept
up
his
wonderful
brightness
and
cheeriness
all
the
time
so
that
bilinski
often
wondered
at
him
and
it
was
worth
wondering
at
for
there
is
nothing
as
everybody
knows
which
sooner
breaks
down
one
spirits
and
brings
on
the
blue
devils
than
being
left
alone
without
friends
and
companionship
how
did
he
do
it
the
fact
is
he
refused
to
be
alone
as
his
friends
in
vienna
left
him
he
simply
turned
more
to
his
friends
in
heaven
and
heaven
came
down
to
him
any
old
vacant
room
in
the
big
house
was
his
chapel
and
through
the
long
lonely
days
often
through
great
part
of
the
night
he
prayed
if
you
could
have
seen
him
pray
imagine
any
boy
who
has
been
away
from
home
for
a
long
stretch
say
a
couple
of
years
and
who
comes
back
and
meets
father
mother
brothers
sisters
he
may
not
say
much
but
he
looks
a
good
deal
and
he
feels
more
than
any
words
can
say
that
is
the
way
stanislaus
prayed
he
just
turned
to
god
and
his
mother
in
heaven
with
all
his
love
in
his
eyes
and
immense
happiness
in
his
heart
and
if
he
spoke
or
said
things
to
them
in
his
mind
he
could
speak
simply
like
a
little
child
because
no
one
else
would
hear
him
and
he
would
not
need
be
shy
or
bashful
if
you
could
have
seen
him
pray
you
would
never
think
as
so
many
do
that
praying
is
a
gloomy
business
his
face
was
lit
up
his
eyes
bright
his
whole
body
spoke
of
peace
and
courage
and
joy
he
kept
thinking
so
much
about
heaven
that
he
seemed
to
live
there
in
advance
everybody
knows
how
when
the
school
year
is
nearly
over
and
vacations
are
at
hand
there
is
a
joyful
atmosphere
about
the
days
lessons
do
not
seem
so
hard
though
they
really
are
just
the
same
old
lessons
classes
seem
to
have
more
life
and
spirit
in
them
boys
are
in
better
temper
every
detail
of
work
and
play
is
colored
by
expectation
as
if
the
relief
of
vacation
were
already
foretasted
stanislaus
looked
forward
just
that
way
to
the
great
vacation
to
going
home
forever
he
knew
that
even
the
longest
life
ends
soon
that
all
its
difficulties
and
troubles
pass
away
and
eternity
begins
and
he
felt
so
looking
ahead
to
that
eternity
that
nothing
happening
here
could
sadden
him
except
sin
and
he
kept
away
from
that
paul
and
his
boisterous
fellows
thought
that
paul
younger
brother
was
a
queer
chap
but
they
liked
him
just
the
same
because
he
was
always
pleasant
and
smiling
he
never
said
a
word
to
them
about
their
conduct
but
when
they
talked
to
him
he
naturally
spoke
of
the
things
he
was
always
thinking
about
and
they
did
not
like
that
such
talk
tended
to
stir
up
their
consciences
even
to
frighten
them
and
they
did
not
want
their
stirred
up
you
can
often
see
that
you
may
have
noticed
in
yourself
that
if
you
are
not
living
as
you
ought
to
live
any
word
about
god
or
death
or
heaven
or
our
blessed
lady
irritates
you
makes
you
feel
horribly
uncomfortable
and
so
stanislaus
became
a
puzzle
to
them
because
they
would
not
see
and
little
by
little
they
left
him
alone
or
only
spoke
to
him
to
tease
him
or
make
fun
of
him
chapter
vii
the
test
of
courage
paul
was
the
worst
at
this
teasing
nor
did
it
stop
at
mere
teasing
he
was
not
a
really
bad
fellow
but
he
was
selfish
set
upon
having
his
own
will
in
everything
and
had
a
very
quick
and
fierce
temper
stanislaus
quiet
refusal
to
join
in
the
noisy
revels
of
himself
and
his
companions
his
unaffected
piety
his
long
hours
of
prayer
were
things
he
could
not
understand
they
seemed
a
sort
of
standing
rebuke
to
him
and
they
constantly
nettled
him
of
course
he
sought
reasons
to
justify
himself
as
we
all
do
when
we
are
in
the
wrong
when
they
were
alone
he
and
bilinski
fell
to
scolding
stanislaus
you
shame
us
paul
would
cry
you
do
not
act
like
a
nobleman
but
like
some
boorish
peasant
then
stanislaus
would
be
troubled
he
knew
he
was
in
the
right
he
simply
could
not
stand
the
free
ways
and
freer
speech
of
paul
and
his
companions
but
how
could
he
justify
himself
how
could
he
defend
his
own
position
without
at
least
seeming
to
attack
his
brother
and
that
last
he
would
never
do
he
tried
to
smooth
matters
over
by
saying
we
take
different
ways
paul
i
do
not
condemn
yours
why
not
let
me
alone
in
mine
but
oftenest
he
could
only
smile
and
say
nothing
and
whether
he
answered
or
kept
silence
paul
was
sure
to
grow
more
irritated
then
bilinski
tried
to
exert
his
authority
your
father
gave
you
into
my
charge
he
would
say
i
order
you
to
act
like
the
rest
of
us
and
not
make
yourself
odd
and
shame
us
by
your
conduct
but
stanislaus
knew
well
enough
what
were
the
limits
of
authority
and
he
was
not
at
all
the
sort
of
boy
to
be
easily
bullied
by
a
mere
assumption
of
authority
that
did
not
exist
the
result
always
was
that
stanislaus
continued
to
do
what
his
own
conscience
urged
him
to
do
and
that
bilinski
and
paul
felt
helpless
in
the
face
of
his
quiet
fearless
persistence
and
that
made
them
the
more
vexed
with
him
they
nicknamed
him
the
jesuit
they
mimicked
him
they
sneered
at
him
he
had
a
pretty
hot
temper
himself
but
he
kept
himself
well
in
hand
and
was
always
kind
and
pleasant
with
these
comrades
he
was
not
the
least
bit
afraid
whenever
he
thought
that
speaking
would
do
any
good
he
spoke
up
without
hesitation
many
a
time
when
paul
taunted
him
with
acting
in
a
way
to
bring
discredit
upon
his
name
he
answered
no
man
shames
his
name
by
trying
to
please
god
as
for
what
men
may
think
or
say
that
does
not
matter
much
do
you
think
we
shall
bother
much
about
that
in
eternity
there
were
two
cousins
of
theirs
who
often
stayed
with
the
kostkas
one
of
them
was
also
called
stanislaus
the
other
who
afterwards
rose
to
high
rank
in
his
native
country
was
named
rozrarewski
these
sided
with
paul
and
did
their
best
to
help
him
in
making
stanislaus
life
miserable
it
was
not
long
before
paul
went
on
from
words
to
blows
one
day
stanislaus
quietly
tried
to
answer
some
of
paul
sneers
paul
sprang
at
him
in
a
rage
and
striking
out
savagely
knocked
him
down
bilinski
interfered
and
when
he
had
drawn
off
paul
proceeded
to
scold
stanislaus
as
being
the
cause
of
all
the
trouble
such
meanness
and
injustice
must
have
made
the
boy
blood
boil
but
he
mastered
himself
and
said
nothing
that
afternoon
paul
was
going
out
riding
he
could
not
find
his
spurs
take
mine
said
stanislaus
pleasantly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
paul
took
them
a
little
ashamed
saying
to
himself
he
a
decent
little
beggar
after
all
if
only
he
were
so
insufferably
pious
but
paul
though
he
might
be
touched
for
the
moment
by
his
readiness
to
forgive
continued
to
grow
even
more
irritated
with
him
many
and
many
a
time
he
struck
stanislaus
and
often
after
knocking
him
down
kicked
him
and
then
tramped
on
him
and
bilinski
always
took
the
same
line
trying
to
make
peace
by
blaming
everything
on
stanislaus
now
stanislaus
was
very
nearly
paul
equal
in
size
and
easily
his
match
in
strength
he
lived
simply
and
frugally
kept
himself
in
condition
did
not
and
as
paul
did
he
could
without
much
difficulty
have
met
paul
brutality
in
kind
and
very
likely
have
given
him
a
good
beating
and
he
knew
well
enough
that
if
he
did
so
paul
would
let
him
alone
for
when
was
there
ever
a
bully
who
was
not
also
a
coward
and
you
may
be
sure
he
felt
like
doing
it
he
was
in
the
right
and
knew
he
was
he
was
and
utterly
without
fear
and
yet
he
never
even
defended
himself
lie
let
paul
bully
him
and
beat
him
he
endured
to
have
himself
looked
upon
as
a
coward
although
you
may
observe
that
all
the
time
he
did
not
budge
an
inch
from
the
line
of
conduct
he
had
chosen
and
why
well
for
a
lot
of
reasons
in
the
first
place
he
kept
saying
to
himself
what
difference
does
it
make
for
eternity
then
he
knew
his
own
high
temper
and
he
would
not
let
himself
go
for
fear
he
should
commit
a
sin
and
he
hated
sin
with
all
his
soul
and
then
he
recalled
what
our
lord
had
suffered
for
him
and
he
said
if
you
will
give
me
the
courage
to
stand
it
i
be
glad
lord
to
suffer
this
much
for
you
and
that
last
was
the
reason
why
in
the
midst
of
this
real
persecution
he
never
lost
his
cheerfulness
more
than
that
he
never
missed
a
chance
to
do
paul
and
his
friends
a
good
turn
he
said
when
men
were
treating
our
lord
worst
even
killing
him
that
was
when
he
was
opening
heaven
for
them
and
i
sure
he
would
like
me
to
be
kind
as
he
was
kind
to
those
who
treated
him
meanly
he
did
what
he
could
to
avoid
annoying
paul
he
kept
out
of
everybody
way
when
he
wanted
to
pray
he
used
to
wait
at
night
till
the
others
were
asleep
for
they
all
slept
in
one
great
room
together
and
then
slip
out
of
bed
and
on
to
his
knees
sometimes
his
cousins
thinking
it
a
great
joke
would
pretend
to
stumble
over
him
in
the
and
kick
him
as
hard
as
they
could
and
this
went
on
for
two
years
he
could
have
stopped
the
whole
matter
with
no
trouble
at
all
by
simply
writing
to
his
father
but
he
never
so
much
as
hinted
to
any
one
at
home
of
the
way
paul
and
bilinski
and
his
cousins
treated
him
he
was
as
plucky
as
he
was
gentle
and
forgiving
although
for
good
reasons
he
would
not
quarrel
he
had
the
tenacity
of
a
he
held
on
to
the
hard
purpose
he
had
formed
and
nothing
could
beat
him
off
and
that
is
the
very
highest
sort
of
courage
the
courage
that
endures
that
has
no
show
or
heroics
about
it
again
i
say
if
he
had
done
all
this
put
up
with
all
this
to
gain
riches
to
make
a
name
for
himself
the
world
would
understand
and
would
praise
him
tremendously
it
is
his
motive
that
leaves
the
world
cold
it
is
the
source
and
reason
of
his
courage
that
the
world
can
not
understand
yet
he
was
not
obstinate
and
bound
to
do
as
he
wished
just
because
he
wished
it
no
he
was
very
sensible
and
did
everything
with
reason
he
would
not
stop
saying
his
prayers
when
bilinski
and
paul
objected
he
would
not
join
in
gay
dinners
and
and
gambling
he
would
not
sit
and
smile
at
shady
stories
or
smutty
wit
he
would
no
do
anything
his
conscience
forbade
but
he
was
most
ready
to
do
anything
else
they
wanted
for
instance
he
had
been
used
to
give
his
rich
clothes
away
to
the
poor
and
dress
very
simply
bilinski
and
paul
insisted
on
his
dressing
as
became
his
rank
and
he
yielded
readily
bilinski
wanted
him
to
take
dancing
lessons
and
he
took
them
and
learned
to
dance
very
well
he
was
not
keen
about
any
of
these
things
because
he
reckoned
they
would
not
count
for
much
in
eternity
but
neither
was
he
foolish
nor
a
fanatic
nor
one
who
saw
evil
where
no
evil
was
he
was
simply
a
boy
who
figured
out
the
business
of
life
clearly
and
convincingly
and
who
had
the
courage
of
a
hero
in
living
up
to
his
convictions
chapter
viii
in
danger
of
death
two
years
of
loneliness
when
his
brother
and
his
cousins
and
his
tutor
who
should
have
been
his
comrades
were
his
persecutors
two
years
in
which
he
was
always
under
a
strain
always
having
to
control
his
anger
to
be
patient
and
amidst
a
thousand
vexations
two
years
moreover
in
which
the
bodily
exercise
he
was
used
to
and
which
he
needed
as
every
growing
boy
needs
it
was
cut
down
to
a
minimum
two
such
years
would
have
broken
the
health
even
of
a
grown
strong
man
and
stanislaus
was
not
a
grown
strong
man
but
a
boy
of
sixteen
it
is
remarkable
that
he
should
have
held
out
so
long
it
shows
what
courage
and
goodness
and
trust
in
god
can
do
but
finally
towards
the
end
of
november
his
body
and
brain
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
fell
sick
with
fever
he
was
not
a
baby
he
did
not
complain
or
even
tell
any
one
that
he
felt
unwell
he
kept
to
his
feet
for
weeks
trying
to
go
on
as
usual
with
his
work
and
his
prayers
the
feast
of
saint
barbara
who
had
been
the
patroness
of
the
boys
sodality
in
vienna
was
drawing
near
stanislaus
prepared
for
it
with
particular
care
and
devotion
saint
barbara
was
the
patroness
of
a
happy
death
and
her
clients
always
besought
of
her
the
special
grace
of
receiving
the
holy
viaticum
when
dying
december
the
feast
of
the
saint
came
and
passed
stanislaus
grew
weaker
his
fever
increased
about
the
middle
of
the
month
he
had
to
keep
his
bed
and
his
condition
quickly
became
serious
then
bilinski
and
paul
forgot
their
anger
against
the
boy
they
called
in
the
best
physicians
of
the
city
they
spared
no
pains
or
expense
the
servants
who
had
always
loved
this
gentle
master
were
all
kindness
and
attention
but
despite
the
efforts
of
all
stanislaus
became
steadily
worse
he
was
entirely
at
peace
not
at
all
afraid
yet
he
felt
that
death
was
coming
near
he
prayed
whole
hours
smiling
gladly
in
talk
with
our
lord
with
the
blessed
virgin
with
his
guardian
angel
he
was
ready
even
eager
to
go
home
the
evil
spirit
wondered
at
this
boy
of
sixteen
who
had
fought
him
off
so
bravely
through
his
life
and
who
was
dying
now
so
fearlessly
one
day
when
his
people
and
even
the
servants
had
left
him
for
a
little
while
stanislaus
saw
an
enormous
black
dog
with
glaring
eyes
and
hideous
foaming
jaws
rush
across
the
room
toward
his
bed
the
door
was
closed
it
was
impossible
for
the
beast
to
have
entered
the
room
in
any
ordinary
way
stanislaus
had
no
notion
how
it
could
have
come
there
but
if
he
was
frightened
for
the
moment
he
did
not
lose
his
wits
with
an
effort
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
he
cried
aloud
instantly
the
huge
snarling
dog
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
thud
as
if
struck
by
a
sword
but
after
a
few
moments
he
sprang
up
again
and
first
circling
the
room
came
crouching
to
the
bed
howling
as
no
mortal
dog
could
howl
making
ready
to
spring
at
the
sick
boy
again
stanislaus
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
again
the
terrible
dog
was
stricken
to
the
floor
a
third
time
he
came
only
to
be
beaten
back
in
the
same
way
and
then
standing
with
bristling
hair
and
horrible
cries
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
vanished
from
sight
stanislaus
fell
back
on
the
bed
fearfully
exhausted
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
thanked
god
for
his
deliverance
the
shock
of
this
dreadful
incident
prostrated
him
he
failed
more
and
more
the
doctors
coming
several
times
a
day
shook
their
heads
in
despair
we
can
do
no
more
they
said
the
end
is
now
only
a
question
of
time
for
seven
days
and
nights
bilinski
sat
by
his
bed
snatching
only
a
few
hours
sleep
now
and
then
for
he
feared
that
stanislaus
might
die
any
moment
yet
in
all
this
long
time
they
had
brought
no
priest
to
the
dying
boy
every
day
he
begged
them
earnestly
that
he
might
receive
the
holy
viaticum
but
they
lied
to
him
bilinski
said
you
will
soon
be
well
the
doctors
will
cure
you
do
think
of
death
or
go
frightening
yourself
i
am
not
afraid
said
stanislaus
but
i
know
i
am
dying
do
not
let
me
die
without
holy
communion
but
bilinski
still
put
him
off
and
tried
to
tease
him
jokingly
with
charges
of
cowardice
the
fact
was
bilinski
and
paul
were
afraid
of
their
lutheran
landlord
the
senator
kimberker
his
prejudice
was
intense
they
feared
he
might
put
them
sick
boy
and
all
out
of
his
house
if
they
dared
to
bring
a
priest
and
the
blessed
sacrament
into
it
that
was
a
hard
trial
for
stanislaus
but
he
met
it
as
he
had
met
every
difficulty
bravely
hopefully
cheerfully
he
remembered
saint
barbara
of
whom
he
had
asked
grace
of
not
dying
without
the
holy
viaticum
he
renewed
his
prayers
for
her
intercession
he
laid
his
whole
case
with
confidence
before
god
and
with
confidence
waited
bilinski
still
sat
by
his
bed
watching
anxiously
the
day
passed
the
light
failed
darkness
and
night
came
on
stanislaus
all
the
time
had
lain
quiet
his
face
smiling
as
ever
his
lips
moving
in
prayer
suddenly
he
turned
to
bilinski
radiant
glowing
with
joy
kneel
down
kneel
down
he
said
in
a
clear
but
low
voice
two
angels
of
god
are
bringing
the
blessed
sacrament
and
with
them
comes
saint
barbara
then
worn
out
though
he
was
by
his
long
sickness
stanislaus
raised
himself
knelt
on
the
bed
and
struck
his
breast
as
he
three
times
repeated
lord
i
am
not
worthy
then
he
raised
his
face
and
opening
his
lips
received
his
sacramental
lord
bilinski
looked
on
with
awe
and
almost
terror
unable
to
say
a
word
stanislaus
when
he
had
received
the
blessed
sacrament
lay
down
again
in
bed
and
began
his
thanksgiving
he
was
more
than
ever
ready
for
death
now
but
still
death
held
off
all
the
next
day
he
passed
in
quiet
the
doctors
said
now
is
the
end
he
may
die
at
any
moment
but
he
was
not
to
die
yet
toward
evening
our
lady
herself
came
to
him
carrying
in
her
arms
the
infant
jesus
the
sick
boy
looked
up
in
wonder
and
delight
there
was
his
mother
smiling
at
him
and
in
her
arms
the
laughing
infant
the
divine
child
stretched
out
his
little
hands
to
stanislaus
and
stanislaus
sitting
up
in
his
bed
took
him
into
his
arms
what
passed
in
his
soul
then
what
joy
filled
his
heart
we
can
not
know
until
we
shall
come
to
heaven
and
taste
for
ourselves
of
that
joy
and
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
child
jesus
spoke
to
him
and
comforted
him
but
stanislaus
was
too
overcome
to
say
anything
only
tears
streamed
down
from
his
eyes
as
he
pressed
the
infant
savior
to
his
breast
our
lady
said
to
him
you
must
end
your
days
in
the
society
that
bears
my
son
name
you
must
be
a
jesuit
but
so
soon
as
he
had
taken
the
infant
into
his
arms
stanislaus
felt
that
the
fever
left
him
his
strength
came
back
the
blood
coursed
through
his
body
with
a
new
sense
of
vigor
and
vitality
then
our
lady
received
her
child
back
from
his
hands
smiled
at
him
and
blessed
him
and
so
vanished
from
his
sight
stanislaus
called
for
his
clothes
dressed
and
got
up
bilinski
and
paul
and
the
doctors
were
astounded
it
can
not
be
they
cried
but
you
see
that
it
is
said
stanislaus
i
am
as
well
as
ever
our
lady
and
the
little
jesus
came
and
cured
me
and
now
i
must
go
to
the
church
and
thank
them
nor
did
the
fever
return
he
was
entirely
recovered
the
house
in
which
this
occurred
is
now
a
sanctuary
and
in
the
room
in
which
stanislaus
had
received
such
favors
from
god
an
altar
stands
and
above
it
a
statue
of
the
saint
chapter
ix
vocation
when
our
lady
came
to
cure
stanislaus
she
told
him
absolutely
that
he
must
become
a
jesuit
that
was
not
the
first
idea
stanislaus
had
had
of
his
vocation
even
some
months
before
his
illness
he
had
felt
himself
drawn
to
enter
the
society
of
jesus
but
now
all
doubts
removed
he
made
a
vow
in
thanksgiving
to
obey
our
command
he
went
to
his
confessor
the
jesuit
father
doni
and
told
him
of
the
vision
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
her
order
to
become
a
jesuit
father
doni
believed
him
readily
enough
but
he
said
i
can
do
nothing
myself
in
the
matter
you
must
go
to
the
provincial
for
only
he
can
admit
you
but
i
am
afraid
there
will
be
difficulties
stanislaus
was
not
merely
afraid
he
was
quite
certain
there
would
be
difficulties
however
he
assured
father
doni
even
if
there
be
no
end
of
difficulties
still
i
shall
be
a
jesuit
since
our
lady
has
commanded
me
she
will
find
a
way
the
provincial
father
laurence
maggi
received
stanislaus
kindly
of
course
yet
with
anything
but
encouragement
there
had
been
trouble
for
the
society
shortly
before
though
in
another
place
because
of
some
novices
admitted
without
their
parents
consent
the
provincial
did
not
wish
to
risk
having
a
like
disturbance
brought
about
his
own
ears
but
the
blessed
virgin
will
take
care
of
the
whole
business
father
said
stanislaus
she
will
quiet
any
opposition
my
father
may
make
well
the
provincial
was
willing
to
believe
that
too
but
he
knew
that
god
wants
us
to
use
our
own
common
sense
and
not
to
act
rashly
and
then
rely
upon
him
or
upon
our
lady
intercession
with
him
to
get
us
out
of
scrapes
so
he
had
to
give
the
only
answer
which
prudence
could
give
to
all
stanislaus
petitions
you
must
either
get
your
father
permission
or
you
must
wait
until
you
are
of
age
and
your
own
master
now
stanislaus
was
quite
certain
his
father
would
not
hear
for
a
moment
of
his
becoming
a
jesuit
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
want
to
wait
four
or
five
years
until
he
should
come
of
age
he
had
that
peculiar
courage
which
many
people
can
not
understand
at
all
the
courage
to
be
afraid
he
was
very
much
afraid
afraid
to
trifle
with
god
grace
afraid
lest
if
he
did
not
take
the
favor
now
when
it
was
offered
him
it
might
not
be
offered
another
time
he
thought
of
another
means
of
persuading
the
provincial
the
apostolic
legate
of
pope
saint
pius
v
to
the
court
of
the
emperor
at
vienna
was
cardinal
commendoni
this
cardinal
had
been
nuncio
and
afterwards
legate
to
poland
and
had
come
from
poland
only
a
year
or
so
before
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
lord
john
kostka
and
with
stanislaus
when
he
came
to
vienna
paul
and
stanislaus
had
visited
him
and
stanislaus
had
made
the
cardinal
as
he
did
most
people
his
friend
so
he
went
to
cardinal
commendoni
he
figured
hopefully
that
as
the
cardinal
was
the
pope
representative
he
could
easily
impose
his
will
on
the
jesuit
provincial
and
of
course
he
would
do
so
as
his
friend
commendoni
welcomed
the
boy
listened
to
him
attentively
marvelled
at
his
unaffected
goodness
and
at
the
heavenly
favors
shown
him
stanislaus
told
him
of
the
distressing
obstinacy
of
the
provincial
but
how
about
your
father
the
cardinal
asked
oh
my
father
is
more
hopeless
than
the
provincial
stanislaus
answered
if
i
so
much
as
mentioned
the
matter
to
him
he
would
bring
me
back
to
poland
and
i
should
have
no
chance
at
all
as
commendoni
knew
the
lord
john
pretty
well
he
said
nothing
to
that
but
he
thought
to
himself
that
stanislaus
was
fairly
accurate
in
his
forecast
after
a
moment
thought
he
said
you
certainly
have
a
right
to
follow
your
vocation
god
will
comes
before
even
your
father
but
it
is
not
going
to
be
easy
however
i
shall
speak
to
the
father
provincial
and
do
what
i
can
stanislaus
went
away
with
good
hopes
he
was
to
return
in
a
few
days
to
hear
the
result
of
commendoni
plea
but
when
he
came
back
to
the
cardinal
he
found
only
another
disappointment
the
provincial
not
merely
was
as
stubborn
as
ever
he
had
even
won
the
cardinal
to
his
way
of
thinking
it
was
too
risky
to
admit
him
it
was
altogether
unwise
most
boys
might
have
given
up
after
that
stanislaus
did
not
give
up
he
was
quite
sure
of
what
god
wanted
and
difficulties
simply
did
not
count
lie
was
called
to
be
a
jesuit
and
a
jesuit
he
would
be
if
he
could
not
gain
admission
into
the
society
in
vienna
well
he
would
try
elsewhere
but
even
with
his
mind
fairly
made
up
he
sought
more
guidance
a
young
portuguese
jesuit
father
antoni
had
lately
come
to
vienna
as
preacher
to
the
empress
maria
every
one
was
talking
about
his
ability
his
prudence
his
zeal
stanislaus
went
to
him
and
laid
his
troubles
before
him
father
antoni
took
some
little
time
to
think
it
all
over
then
decided
very
definitely
he
called
stanislaus
to
him
do
you
understand
he
asked
what
it
will
mean
to
go
away
to
leave
your
people
to
live
in
a
strange
country
stanislaus
said
yes
he
understood
perfectly
and
that
you
are
closing
the
door
on
your
return
that
in
no
case
will
you
ever
be
received
again
at
kostkov
yes
stanislaus
knew
that
too
and
that
you
will
have
to
go
an
immense
journey
on
foot
with
plenty
of
hardships
to
find
at
the
end
of
it
a
life
that
is
not
easy
to
live
at
the
beck
and
call
of
another
to
do
menial
work
to
endure
humiliations
to
sacrifice
everything
that
the
world
holds
dear
stanislaus
smiled
at
him
he
had
reckoned
it
all
out
he
had
counted
the
cost
long
before
he
was
ready
then
in
god
name
go
said
father
antonie
and
may
god
be
with
you
in
all
i
give
you
letters
to
father
canisius
the
provincial
in
augsburg
and
to
father
francis
borgia
the
general
who
is
in
rome
then
stanislaus
was
happy
at
last
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
obey
the
command
of
god
which
our
lady
herself
had
brought
him
father
antoni
spoke
with
him
longer
pointed
out
in
detail
many
of
the
difficulties
that
awaited
him
gave
him
counsel
for
the
road
then
he
went
to
write
the
letters
of
introduction
and
stanislaus
went
back
to
paul
and
bilinski
and
their
blows
and
sneers
to
get
ready
for
his
tramp
chapter
x
the
runaway
he
was
going
to
run
away
but
he
was
not
going
to
sneak
away
he
was
just
as
kind
and
forgiving
to
paul
as
he
had
always
been
he
bore
him
no
for
his
three
years
of
abuse
now
that
he
had
determined
upon
a
course
of
action
which
would
free
him
from
a
continuance
of
it
he
had
often
felt
angry
over
paul
treatment
of
him
but
he
had
kept
down
his
anger
under
his
vigorous
will
but
now
he
made
up
his
mind
that
paul
would
receive
something
of
a
shock
the
next
time
he
had
resort
to
his
now
almost
habitual
amusement
of
beating
his
younger
brother
meantime
he
bought
a
peasant
tunic
and
a
pair
of
rough
shoes
that
would
be
serviceable
for
his
long
march
it
was
not
long
before
something
or
other
stanislaus
did
or
said
woke
paul
easily
aroused
rage
he
began
with
oaths
of
which
he
seemed
to
possess
a
pretty
stock
he
worked
himself
up
into
greater
and
greater
heat
of
temper
a
substitute
for
courage
with
many
people
finally
he
sprang
at
stanislaus
formerly
on
such
occasions
stanislaus
was
so
busy
holding
his
own
temper
in
check
that
he
could
do
little
else
he
stood
almost
like
a
statue
but
this
time
paul
felt
there
was
something
wrong
stanislaus
was
looking
straight
at
him
when
he
leaped
to
strike
him
stanislaus
quietly
and
skillfully
thrust
him
aside
paul
stumbled
staggered
recovered
himself
but
when
he
looked
again
fear
took
hold
of
him
he
was
afraid
of
what
he
saw
in
stanislaus
eyes
the
younger
boy
spoke
quietly
coolly
that
will
be
about
enough
he
said
i
put
up
with
your
cowardice
and
brutality
for
three
years
i
stand
it
no
longer
since
i
can
not
have
peace
here
well
i
look
for
it
somewhere
else
you
can
answer
to
our
father
and
tell
him
how
it
happened
paul
was
still
frightened
the
situation
was
extremely
novel
to
him
the
turning
of
the
worm
what
would
happen
next
he
was
afraid
at
first
that
stanislaus
was
going
to
give
him
his
payment
and
he
had
no
stomach
to
face
the
reckoning
he
had
not
noticed
before
how
wiry
and
strong
stanislaus
looked
but
when
he
saw
that
the
boy
made
no
movement
only
spoke
in
that
quiet
voice
he
plucked
up
a
little
courage
he
began
to
bluster
and
swear
you
go
away
will
you
he
cried
what
the
devil
do
i
care
go
and
be
hanged
to
you
that
was
the
gist
of
it
only
a
trifle
more
ornamental
do
forget
said
send
word
to
father
certainly
going
away
paul
was
waxing
eloquent
again
but
stanislaus
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
nor
did
the
bullying
big
brother
venture
to
follow
him
he
contented
himself
with
calling
him
hard
names
which
he
could
not
hear
and
muttering
savagely
to
himself
for
some
time
but
naturally
he
did
not
believe
at
all
that
stanislaus
was
really
going
to
run
he
looked
upon
the
words
as
an
empty
threat
and
so
it
was
all
over
stanislaus
sighed
a
sigh
of
relief
there
was
nothing
ahead
of
him
now
save
the
road
to
augsburg
he
said
his
prayers
tranquilly
and
went
to
bed
morning
came
or
the
dawn
that
precedes
the
morning
stanislaus
got
up
selected
his
finest
suit
of
clothes
and
dressed
his
first
care
was
to
write
the
letter
for
paul
and
his
father
this
he
put
between
the
leaves
of
a
book
the
servants
of
course
even
in
the
primitive
housekeeping
of
the
kostkas
slept
in
another
room
than
the
big
common
apartment
of
their
masters
stanislaus
went
to
the
bed
of
one
of
them
named
pacifici
who
was
rather
particularly
devoted
to
him
and
who
afterwards
became
a
franciscan
he
shook
pacifici
and
woke
him
the
servant
rubbed
his
eyes
sleepily
then
gazed
in
astonishment
at
the
brilliant
figure
standing
in
the
beside
his
bed
what
was
the
lord
stanislaus
doing
dressed
in
this
unusual
finery
at
such
an
unearthly
hour
listen
said
stanislaus
i
am
going
out
for
the
day
i
have
received
an
invitation
which
i
must
accept
i
am
going
now
if
bilinski
or
the
lord
paul
ask
for
me
tell
them
that
i
will
your
grace
i
will
said
pacifici
but
he
was
almost
too
astonished
to
speak
stanislaus
left
the
room
and
the
house
he
walked
quickly
to
the
jesuit
church
where
he
heard
mass
and
received
holy
communion
at
mass
he
met
a
young
hungarian
with
whom
he
had
been
very
intimate
he
beckoned
him
aside
and
whispered
wait
for
me
a
minute
i
just
want
to
say
a
word
to
father
antoni
then
he
hurried
away
but
was
back
shortly
at
his
friend
side
eyes
dancing
lips
smiling
hand
outstretched
i
have
just
bid
father
antoni
he
said
with
a
little
excitement
i
am
running
away
i
am
going
to
augsburg
to
ask
admission
into
the
society
of
jesus
i
told
paul
yesterday
that
i
should
not
stay
with
him
and
i
have
written
a
letter
and
put
it
in
a
book
do
not
tell
any
one
what
i
tell
you
now
but
after
a
few
days
please
go
and
point
out
the
letter
to
paul
his
friend
listened
with
wonder
going
away
going
to
augsburg
but
how
he
asked
not
on
foot
on
foot
to
be
sure
answered
stanislaus
gayly
do
you
think
i
have
a
horse
secreted
about
me
or
could
i
take
one
of
ours
and
wake
the
house
and
you
will
be
a
jesuit
and
teach
and
never
ride
a
good
horse
again
and
give
up
your
people
and
your
place
in
the
world
i
shall
be
a
jesuit
if
i
can
said
stanislaus
as
for
what
i
shall
give
up
well
i
have
to
give
it
up
when
death
came
would
i
and
since
god
wants
it
i
sooner
give
it
up
now
but
he
had
not
much
time
for
talk
day
was
growing
he
must
be
off
he
got
his
friend
promise
about
the
letter
bade
him
heartily
and
cheerily
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
augsburg
road
what
happened
else
that
day
we
have
already
seen
and
how
paul
and
bilinski
followed
him
and
how
he
got
away
and
how
he
did
walk
bravely
gayly
in
less
than
two
weeks
the
four
hundred
miles
to
augsburg
chapter
xi
at
dilligen
it
was
well
on
in
the
afternoon
of
august
or
when
stanislaus
arrived
at
augsburg
the
town
was
strange
to
him
he
had
to
ask
his
way
to
the
jesuit
house
i
want
to
see
father
canisius
he
told
the
porter
at
the
door
i
have
a
letter
of
introduction
to
him
the
porter
was
very
sorry
but
father
canisius
was
not
in
augsburg
stanislaus
heart
fell
not
in
augsburg
his
four
hundred
miles
on
foot
for
nothing
it
was
a
terrible
disappointment
wait
a
moment
said
the
porter
until
i
call
one
of
the
fathers
as
stanislaus
waited
he
kept
asking
himself
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
now
and
for
a
little
while
he
could
not
think
clearly
he
felt
almost
sick
but
he
was
not
the
kind
to
be
discouraged
long
and
before
the
porter
returned
with
the
father
he
had
made
up
his
mind
since
canisius
is
not
in
augsburg
well
i
go
to
whatever
place
he
is
in
the
father
who
came
was
all
regrets
canisius
had
gone
to
dillingen
but
would
not
stanislaus
come
in
and
at
least
rest
a
few
days
before
seeking
him
further
no
stanislaus
was
going
on
at
once
how
far
is
it
he
asked
and
can
you
point
me
out
the
road
it
is
about
miles
the
father
answered
but
you
ca
go
on
this
evening
you
must
be
dreadfully
tired
yes
he
was
tired
but
not
so
tired
that
he
could
not
go
to
dillingen
it
is
only
a
little
way
after
all
he
said
smiling
as
he
always
smiled
but
he
stopped
to
eat
something
with
the
jesuits
both
because
he
was
hungry
and
because
it
would
be
discourteous
to
refuse
all
their
kind
offers
one
of
the
had
to
go
on
business
to
dillingen
so
he
hastened
to
accompany
stanislaus
it
is
from
his
testimony
that
we
know
what
happened
on
the
way
before
the
sun
had
quite
set
he
was
on
the
road
once
more
he
slept
in
a
field
that
night
he
was
up
early
the
next
morning
and
stepped
out
bravely
fasting
and
hoping
for
a
chance
to
go
to
holy
communion
the
evening
before
he
had
left
augsburg
a
good
many
miles
behind
a
few
miles
more
in
the
early
morning
brought
him
to
a
little
village
from
some
distance
he
saw
the
spire
of
its
church
he
hastened
his
steps
lest
mass
should
be
over
before
he
reached
the
place
when
he
came
to
the
church
he
saw
through
its
open
door
a
scattered
little
congregation
at
their
prayers
he
entered
quickly
sank
to
his
knees
and
dropping
his
face
between
his
hands
began
to
pray
but
somehow
the
place
felt
strange
after
a
bit
he
looked
about
him
and
saw
with
astonishment
that
he
was
in
a
lutheran
church
the
lutheran
heresy
was
still
young
and
kept
up
many
catholic
practices
it
was
easy
to
be
deceived
he
felt
a
little
shocked
he
had
been
preparing
to
receive
holy
communion
and
now
he
should
have
to
go
without
but
as
he
looked
about
the
church
to
his
eyes
glowed
with
light
out
of
the
light
came
a
troop
of
blessed
angels
and
drew
near
to
him
he
was
frightened
delighted
all
at
once
then
he
saw
that
one
of
the
angels
bore
with
deep
reverence
the
blessed
sacrament
and
that
god
had
granted
his
desire
for
holy
communion
he
received
it
with
quiet
joy
but
simply
humbly
for
he
knew
that
this
miracle
of
its
coming
to
him
was
as
nothing
to
the
miracle
that
there
should
be
any
blessed
sacrament
at
all
since
god
had
stooped
to
leave
us
his
flesh
and
blood
the
manner
in
which
he
gave
it
was
of
quite
secondary
importance
it
would
have
astounded
us
to
be
in
his
place
in
the
little
lutheran
church
that
morning
we
try
to
fancy
how
we
should
feel
if
we
too
saw
a
host
of
angels
approach
us
yet
every
day
we
may
avail
ourselves
of
that
more
wonderful
miracle
before
which
even
visions
of
angels
pale
the
miracle
of
having
god
himself
for
our
meat
and
drink
that
day
brought
him
to
dillingen
and
peter
canisius
the
of
germany
as
he
was
called
for
his
vigilance
against
heresy
canisius
read
the
letter
of
father
antoni
and
listened
to
stanislaus
story
it
was
all
quite
wonderful
as
the
boy
talked
canisius
looked
at
him
and
studied
him
not
quite
seventeen
lively
handsome
full
of
spirit
and
daring
quick
in
speech
eager
affectionate
pious
you
might
call
canisius
a
man
of
war
an
old
veteran
his
hair
had
grown
gray
in
battles
of
the
soul
in
fighting
back
heresy
in
strengthening
weak
hearts
through
that
age
of
trial
he
knew
the
value
of
enthusiasm
but
he
knew
its
weakness
too
a
very
taking
lad
he
thought
to
himself
he
flashes
like
a
rapier
but
will
his
metal
stand
hard
use
it
was
the
thought
of
common
sense
he
did
not
mistrust
stanislaus
but
on
the
other
hand
what
did
he
know
about
him
he
had
not
much
to
go
by
as
yet
only
antoni
letter
and
the
boy
engaging
presence
he
would
take
no
definite
step
about
admitting
stanislaus
into
the
society
until
he
did
know
more
yon
want
to
be
a
jesuit
he
said
with
thoughtful
brows
when
it
was
on
stanislaus
tongue
to
say
now
at
once
but
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
said
instead
as
soon
as
you
think
fit
you
are
a
stranger
to
us
you
know
canisius
went
on
smiling
a
little
but
pleasantly
and
before
we
admit
men
amongst
us
we
need
to
know
that
they
have
something
more
than
a
mere
desire
to
join
that
takes
time
to
find
out
are
you
willing
to
stop
in
the
college
here
for
a
while
stanislaus
answered
promptly
of
course
i
am
not
as
a
student
said
canisius
but
as
a
servant
as
anything
you
want
stanislaus
agreed
well
come
with
me
canisius
said
and
he
led
the
way
to
the
kitchen
here
a
new
cook
he
said
to
the
brother
in
charge
at
least
he
may
have
in
him
the
makings
of
a
cook
can
you
give
him
something
to
do
it
was
not
a
very
encouraging
reception
although
it
was
not
so
bad
as
it
may
sound
condensed
as
it
is
in
these
pages
neither
was
it
meant
to
be
encouraging
it
was
meant
to
test
stanislaus
was
as
cheerful
as
a
lark
he
rolled
up
his
sleeves
smiled
at
the
brother
and
waited
orders
the
brother
smiled
back
and
said
first
i
think
you
will
have
something
to
eat
then
we
shall
see
about
work
the
jesuit
college
at
dillingen
saint
jerome
was
a
big
place
and
numbered
many
students
many
students
mean
many
cooks
and
servers
at
table
and
servants
about
the
house
stanislaus
took
his
place
amongst
a
score
of
such
he
washed
dishes
helped
prepare
food
swept
scrubbed
he
was
told
to
do
he
ate
with
the
servants
took
his
recreations
with
them
and
he
went
about
it
all
as
simply
and
naturally
as
if
he
had
been
doing
nothing
else
all
his
life
his
jolliness
and
kindness
won
him
friends
on
all
sides
as
they
had
always
done
he
kept
up
his
prayers
you
may
be
sure
ran
in
to
visit
our
lord
in
the
blessed
sacrament
whenever
he
was
free
to
do
so
made
all
he
did
into
a
prayer
and
of
course
that
irritated
some
of
the
other
servants
just
as
it
had
irritated
his
brother
paul
and
so
he
had
no
lack
of
teasing
and
petty
insults
but
he
just
smiled
his
way
through
them
and
kept
on
he
was
perfectly
happy
entirely
confident
that
he
was
doing
will
as
for
the
work
he
chuckled
to
himself
at
the
idea
that
canisius
thought
this
a
test
he
would
willingly
do
a
thousand
times
harder
things
than
that
for
almighty
god
and
after
all
he
said
it
really
was
not
so
hard
many
a
better
man
than
he
had
to
work
much
harder
at
much
more
unpleasant
tasks
and
what
would
it
matter
in
eternity
if
he
scrubbed
pots
and
pans
and
floors
and
windows
all
his
life
the
only
thing
that
mattered
was
to
please
god
and
just
now
this
sort
of
work
was
what
pleased
god
chapter
xii
the
road
to
rome
canisius
kept
stanislaus
at
his
work
in
the
kitchen
and
about
the
house
for
a
couple
of
weeks
he
noted
his
cheerfulness
his
love
of
prayer
his
readiness
to
do
any
sort
of
work
and
best
of
all
his
simplicity
his
entire
lack
of
pose
he
saw
that
this
senator
son
made
no
virtue
of
taking
on
himself
such
lowly
tasks
and
he
knew
therefore
that
he
was
really
humble
then
he
called
the
boy
to
him
he
said
if
i
admit
you
into
the
society
here
your
father
may
still
annoy
you
it
is
better
you
should
go
to
rome
and
become
a
novice
there
i
shall
give
you
a
letter
to
the
father
general
francis
borgia
in
a
few
days
two
of
ours
are
to
go
to
rome
you
can
go
with
them
stanislaus
was
delighted
he
was
come
into
quiet
waters
at
last
but
canisius
spoke
further
first
however
you
must
get
some
decent
clothes
your
old
tunic
he
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
might
do
well
enough
for
a
noble
but
not
for
a
future
jesuit
so
the
college
tailor
made
stanislaus
a
simple
neat
suit
of
clothes
and
about
september
he
set
out
for
rome
he
went
on
foot
of
course
in
the
company
of
jacopo
levanzio
a
genoese
and
fabricius
reiner
of
liége
they
struck
south
through
bavaria
to
the
tyrolese
alps
by
what
pass
they
crossed
the
alps
we
do
not
know
but
stanislaus
saw
first
from
afar
the
white
peaks
with
their
everlasting
snows
shining
in
the
sun
then
he
went
up
and
up
into
cooler
and
rarer
air
where
lungs
expand
and
one
step
is
light
and
buoyant
but
where
one
gets
tired
more
easily
than
in
the
plains
high
up
in
the
passes
he
felt
the
cold
of
winter
although
it
was
as
yet
early
autumn
then
he
came
down
the
southern
slopes
of
the
great
that
locks
in
italy
and
with
him
came
the
headwaters
of
great
rivers
he
came
down
through
bare
rocks
then
through
twisted
then
through
green
and
lovely
valleys
and
so
into
the
plains
of
northern
italy
he
saw
the
mountain
torrents
leap
and
flash
and
grow
always
bigger
and
stronger
he
saw
them
slack
their
speed
and
widen
their
beds
in
the
upland
valleys
he
saw
them
grow
sluggish
tawny
with
mud
in
the
plain
he
saw
the
many
spires
of
milan
wonderful
cathedral
as
they
drew
near
the
city
and
when
they
tarried
there
a
little
while
for
rest
he
saw
the
famous
armor
made
there
hung
up
for
show
in
little
windows
he
passed
great
cavalcades
of
nobles
and
soldiers
and
marvelled
at
their
straight
slim
rapiers
so
different
from
the
heavy
polish
saber
he
heard
italian
speech
for
the
first
time
and
tried
to
get
at
its
meaning
through
his
latin
but
he
and
his
companions
had
not
time
for
observing
they
were
traveling
pretty
swiftly
from
dillingen
to
rome
is
a
matter
of
about
eight
hundred
miles
they
left
dillingen
september
they
reached
rome
october
that
figures
out
to
an
average
of
about
miles
each
day
then
if
you
remember
that
they
had
to
climb
mountains
the
first
part
of
the
way
that
there
were
delays
entering
towns
delays
of
devotion
when
they
came
to
great
churches
you
can
see
that
many
a
day
they
must
have
equaled
or
surpassed
stanislaus
thirty
miles
a
day
from
vienna
but
it
was
pleasanter
for
stanislaus
than
his
first
great
tramp
now
he
had
two
good
companions
with
whom
he
could
speak
easily
and
familiarly
of
the
things
nearest
his
heart
he
had
none
of
the
uncertainty
about
the
result
of
this
journey
which
he
had
had
about
his
former
journey
he
found
shelter
and
friendship
in
many
jesuit
houses
on
the
way
as
the
three
went
on
they
lightened
the
road
with
pious
songs
they
heard
mass
and
received
holy
communion
whenever
occasion
offered
they
knelt
by
many
a
wayside
shrine
a
crucifix
or
statue
of
our
lady
scattered
everywhere
through
catholic
italy
it
did
not
take
the
two
jesuits
long
to
appreciate
stanislaus
and
delight
in
his
company
he
was
so
so
merry
in
all
the
discomforts
and
hardships
of
the
long
road
so
thoroughly
and
simply
good
they
wondered
at
his
physical
endurance
at
the
ease
and
buoyancy
with
which
the
lad
of
seventeen
kept
up
that
hard
march
day
after
day
the
grasses
of
the
campagna
were
brown
and
brittle
the
trees
sere
and
yellow
in
the
autumn
when
they
came
to
the
eternal
city
the
center
of
the
world
then
as
now
the
saintly
general
francis
borgia
busy
as
he
was
with
the
cares
of
the
widespread
society
found
time
to
welcome
the
three
travelers
and
to
hear
wonderful
story
in
full
and
this
time
there
was
no
hesitation
or
delay
stanislaus
entered
his
name
in
the
book
containing
the
register
of
the
novices
on
october
three
days
later
he
received
his
cassock
and
entered
at
once
upon
his
noviceship
there
were
so
many
novices
in
rome
then
that
no
single
house
of
the
jesuits
there
could
hold
them
all
so
they
were
scattered
through
three
houses
each
one
spending
a
part
of
his
two
years
noviceship
successively
in
each
house
stanislaus
went
first
to
the
professed
house
then
called
santa
maria
della
strada
and
afterward
the
site
of
the
famous
gesu
one
of
the
notable
churches
of
rome
from
there
he
passed
in
time
to
the
roman
college
then
to
the
noviciate
proper
at
sant
andrea
the
society
of
jesus
was
then
in
its
early
youth
in
the
midst
of
that
first
brilliant
charge
against
the
ranks
of
heresy
without
and
against
the
huge
sluggish
inertia
so
striking
within
the
church
itself
he
was
with
claude
acquaviva
son
of
the
duke
of
atri
and
afterwards
one
of
the
greatest
generals
of
the
society
which
he
ruled
for
thirty
years
with
him
were
also
claude
nephew
rudolph
acquaviva
who
died
a
martyr
torres
a
great
theologian
prando
the
first
philosopher
at
the
university
of
bologna
fabio
de
fabii
who
traced
his
descent
from
the
great
roman
family
of
that
name
the
pole
warscewiski
formerly
ambassador
to
the
sultan
and
secretary
of
state
in
poland
who
first
wrote
a
life
of
stanislaus
and
many
more
distinguished
for
birth
learning
holiness
most
of
these
were
a
great
deal
older
too
than
stanislaus
many
of
them
had
already
made
their
names
familiar
to
men
yet
the
boy
of
seventeen
who
came
quietly
and
modestly
amongst
them
was
somehow
soon
looked
up
to
by
all
they
felt
the
force
of
something
in
him
which
made
him
their
superior
heaven
was
wonderfully
near
him
he
was
not
he
was
always
a
boy
unconscious
of
anything
unusual
in
himself
not
solemn
nor
impressive
nor
austere
in
manner
all
that
he
did
he
did
with
perfect
naturalness
for
to
him
the
supernatural
had
become
almost
natural
chapter
xiii
the
noviceship
most
of
us
perhaps
think
of
the
saints
as
men
and
women
who
accomplished
visibly
great
things
saint
paul
saint
augustine
saint
patrick
saint
theresa
saint
philip
neri
saint
francis
xavier
such
names
as
these
come
first
to
our
minds
when
we
think
of
a
saint
yet
the
fact
is
that
the
greater
number
of
saints
are
men
and
women
who
never
did
anything
that
the
world
would
consider
great
or
striking
saint
joseph
was
of
that
sort
even
the
blessed
virgin
lived
and
died
in
obscurity
made
no
stir
in
the
world
sanctity
is
measured
not
so
much
by
what
one
does
as
by
how
one
does
all
things
externally
a
saint
may
not
differ
at
all
from
other
people
it
is
his
soul
that
is
different
and
so
a
visitor
to
the
professed
house
in
rome
in
meeting
stanislaus
kostka
would
see
a
handsome
polish
boy
of
seventeen
with
his
sleeves
rolled
up
above
his
elbows
with
an
apron
over
his
cassock
carrying
wood
for
the
kitchen
fires
washing
dishes
serving
at
table
sweeping
corridors
and
rooms
he
got
up
at
half
past
four
or
five
every
morning
he
spent
half
an
hour
in
meditation
in
thinking
over
some
incident
in
our
lord
life
or
some
great
truth
as
that
death
is
near
to
each
of
us
that
this
life
is
only
the
vestibule
of
eternity
that
our
whole
business
in
life
is
to
do
what
god
wants
us
to
do
or
the
like
after
that
came
mass
and
once
or
twice
a
week
holy
communion
and
his
thanksgiving
then
breakfast
taken
in
silence
he
read
in
a
spiritual
book
for
half
an
hour
or
so
after
breakfast
then
went
to
the
kitchen
or
the
dining
hall
or
the
scullery
where
he
set
to
work
under
the
orders
of
the
cook
in
the
course
of
the
morning
there
might
be
a
talk
or
instruction
from
the
priest
in
charge
of
the
novices
there
surely
would
be
one
or
more
visits
to
the
chapel
when
the
hour
for
dinner
came
stanislaus
probably
served
at
table
taking
his
own
meal
later
after
dinner
there
was
an
hour
for
recreation
when
the
novices
walked
and
chatted
in
the
garden
or
about
the
house
the
afternoon
like
the
morning
was
taken
up
with
lowly
work
with
prayer
and
a
little
reading
or
instruction
toward
evening
he
again
spent
half
an
hour
in
meditation
then
came
the
evening
meal
another
hour
of
recreation
a
little
reading
in
preparation
for
next
morning
meditation
and
examination
of
conscience
as
to
how
the
day
had
been
spent
and
then
bed
two
or
three
days
a
week
this
routine
was
broken
sometimes
the
novices
walked
out
into
the
country
to
a
villa
where
they
had
games
and
ate
their
dinner
at
other
times
they
left
their
work
to
go
with
one
of
the
fathers
to
some
church
or
other
upon
business
it
was
a
quiet
humble
life
full
of
peace
near
to
god
hidden
away
from
men
in
this
life
the
novices
had
to
continue
for
two
years
before
they
took
upon
themselves
the
obligation
of
vows
and
before
they
began
the
long
studies
that
prepare
a
jesuit
for
his
work
during
those
two
years
they
tested
their
vocation
making
sure
that
god
really
called
them
to
that
life
and
they
tested
their
own
wills
to
see
if
they
were
ready
to
endure
what
such
a
life
demanded
of
them
stanislaus
did
just
what
the
other
novices
did
did
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
yet
of
course
he
was
different
from
the
others
he
was
a
saint
what
was
the
difference
just
this
they
did
things
more
or
less
well
he
did
things
perfectly
if
he
prayed
he
put
his
whole
mind
and
soul
into
his
prayer
if
he
worked
he
obeyed
orders
absolutely
because
in
doing
so
he
was
obeying
god
there
is
in
the
jesuit
noviciate
at
angers
a
series
of
paintings
portraying
incidents
in
the
life
of
stanislaus
in
one
he
is
shown
carrying
on
his
arm
two
or
three
bits
of
wood
towards
the
kitchen
underneath
is
written
he
will
err
if
he
carry
more
the
painting
commemorates
an
occasion
when
stanislaus
and
claude
acquaviva
were
put
by
the
cook
to
carry
wood
and
told
to
carry
only
two
or
three
pieces
at
a
time
acquaviva
when
the
two
came
to
the
said
laughingly
does
the
cook
think
we
are
babies
why
we
can
each
carry
twenty
or
thirty
of
such
little
pieces
of
wood
to
be
sure
we
can
stanislaus
answered
but
do
you
think
god
wants
us
to
carry
twenty
or
thirty
pieces
now
the
cook
said
two
or
three
and
the
cook
just
at
present
takes
the
place
of
god
to
command
us
and
so
it
was
in
everything
he
studied
singly
to
see
what
would
please
god
most
and
no
matter
how
trifling
seemed
the
command
he
did
just
that
with
all
his
heart
no
one
ever
heard
a
sharp
word
from
him
or
saw
him
take
offense
at
anything
or
act
in
the
least
way
out
of
vanity
or
selfishness
and
of
course
he
was
entirely
unconscious
that
he
was
different
from
the
rest
he
knew
he
was
trying
to
do
his
best
in
everything
but
he
supposed
every
one
else
was
doing
the
same
and
with
all
his
earnestness
and
exactness
he
was
as
simple
and
boyish
as
he
had
ever
been
one
day
cardinal
commendoni
the
legate
to
vienna
and
a
great
friend
of
stanislaus
came
to
rome
and
hurried
over
to
the
roman
college
to
call
upon
stanislaus
stanislaus
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
his
arrival
ran
off
to
meet
him
just
as
he
was
sleeves
rolled
up
apron
on
straight
from
the
scullery
just
as
any
boy
would
do
he
was
in
everything
perfectly
at
ease
content
in
his
little
round
of
little
tasks
going
ahead
toward
heaven
without
any
show
or
heroics
he
was
doing
just
exactly
the
little
things
that
god
wants
us
to
do
and
he
was
entirely
happy
in
so
doing
it
is
true
he
had
never
been
really
unhappy
in
his
whole
life
people
who
keep
close
to
god
never
are
they
have
hard
things
to
put
up
with
they
may
be
poor
or
fall
sick
or
lose
their
relatives
or
friends
by
death
they
may
have
to
fight
very
strong
temptations
they
feel
all
these
things
as
keenly
as
others
feel
them
but
they
do
not
become
unhappy
we
may
say
they
have
a
world
of
their
own
to
live
in
that
their
inmost
lives
are
spent
in
that
world
very
little
touched
by
the
changes
and
accidents
of
the
outer
world
they
see
that
there
is
an
outer
world
but
they
choose
deliberately
to
ignore
it
they
will
not
go
into
it
you
know
that
if
you
go
down
deep
into
the
sea
as
men
go
in
submarines
you
find
calm
there
always
even
though
a
storm
be
raging
up
above
and
the
waves
toss
with
angry
violence
so
if
you
once
get
inside
your
life
under
the
surface
in
the
heart
of
life
where
god
is
you
will
find
calm
there
also
and
a
certain
peace
which
is
as
near
as
we
can
come
to
entire
happiness
in
this
world
but
though
stanislaus
had
learned
this
secret
and
had
therefore
always
kept
his
soul
merry
he
was
happiest
of
all
during
the
time
of
his
noviceship
the
very
air
around
him
breathed
of
god
and
heaven
his
life
there
was
really
an
unbroken
prayer
he
was
like
a
swimmer
who
has
been
fighting
his
way
through
nasty
choppy
little
waves
going
ahead
surely
but
with
great
difficulty
and
who
comes
at
last
into
long
quiet
rolling
swells
where
his
progress
is
delightful
where
he
can
make
long
easy
strokes
and
feel
pleasure
in
the
very
effort
and
as
he
was
young
and
ardent
he
was
in
danger
of
overdoing
things
prayer
even
when
it
is
a
joy
is
always
hard
work
for
us
poor
mortals
stanislaus
gave
himself
so
heartily
now
to
praying
that
he
ran
risk
of
losing
his
strength
and
health
so
his
superiors
being
sensible
men
stepped
in
and
moderated
his
energy
he
was
made
to
work
more
and
pray
less
told
to
be
prudent
to
husband
his
strength
for
future
work
and
of
course
he
did
as
he
was
told
but
god
had
special
designs
on
stanislaus
he
was
never
to
use
his
health
and
energy
in
work
as
a
priest
or
teacher
indeed
his
work
was
nearly
over
though
it
had
been
so
brief
he
had
no
long
career
before
him
on
this
earth
he
was
going
home
and
going
soon
chapter
xiv
going
home
when
stanislaus
had
been
a
novice
nine
months
peter
canisius
came
one
day
to
rome
on
business
at
this
time
stanislaus
was
living
in
the
noviciate
proper
sant
andrea
on
the
quirinal
of
course
the
novices
were
all
keen
to
see
and
hear
the
great
canisius
the
man
who
had
done
such
superb
work
in
germany
and
whatever
curiosity
they
had
was
satisfied
for
canisius
came
to
the
community
at
andrea
and
gave
a
little
sermon
or
talk
it
was
the
first
of
august
the
month
always
most
dangerous
to
health
in
rome
just
for
that
reason
perhaps
the
old
romans
had
made
the
beginning
of
that
month
a
time
of
feasting
and
boisterous
holiday
and
an
old
proverb
had
come
down
ferrare
agosto
give
august
a
jolly
welcome
canisius
took
this
proverb
for
his
text
but
turned
it
to
say
give
every
month
a
jolly
welcome
for
it
may
be
your
last
after
the
talk
the
novices
according
to
custom
discussed
amongst
themselves
what
had
been
said
it
came
stanislaus
turn
to
speak
he
said
what
father
canisius
has
just
told
us
is
a
holy
warning
for
all
of
course
but
for
me
it
is
something
more
because
this
month
of
august
is
to
be
really
my
last
month
earth
to
be
sure
no
one
paid
special
attention
to
this
strange
remark
novices
often
say
things
that
will
not
bear
too
much
analysis
particularly
no
one
would
look
seriously
upon
what
stanislaus
had
said
since
he
was
at
the
time
in
perfect
health
four
days
later
the
feast
of
our
lady
of
the
snows
stanislaus
had
occasion
to
go
with
the
great
theologian
father
emmanuel
de
sa
to
the
church
of
santa
maria
maggiore
for
there
the
beautiful
feast
is
kept
with
singular
ceremony
as
that
church
is
the
one
connected
with
the
origin
of
the
feast
each
year
during
vespers
on
august
a
shower
of
jasmin
leaves
sifts
down
from
the
high
dome
of
a
chapel
in
santa
maria
maggiore
to
commemorate
the
miraculous
snow
in
august
which
marked
out
the
spot
where
the
church
was
to
be
built
as
they
went
along
de
sa
turned
the
talk
to
the
coming
feast
of
the
assumption
of
our
blessed
lady
stanislaus
spoke
with
delight
as
he
always
spoke
of
our
lady
when
our
lady
entered
paradise
he
said
i
think
god
made
a
new
glory
for
his
mother
and
all
the
saints
made
a
court
about
her
and
did
reverence
to
her
as
we
do
to
a
king
and
i
hope
he
added
that
i
shall
be
up
there
myself
to
enjoy
this
coming
feast
again
his
words
were
not
taken
at
their
face
value
father
de
sa
thought
he
spoke
of
being
in
heaven
in
spirit
for
the
feast
the
practice
now
common
was
new
then
of
alloting
to
each
in
the
community
as
special
patron
some
particular
saint
whose
feast
occurred
during
the
month
stanislaus
had
drawn
saint
lawrence
for
his
patron
the
feast
of
the
saint
is
celebrated
on
august
stanislaus
who
had
clear
intimations
of
his
quickly
approaching
death
and
was
eager
to
go
to
heaven
asked
saint
lawrence
to
intercede
for
him
that
his
might
be
on
the
feast
of
the
assumption
he
got
permission
to
practice
some
penances
in
honor
of
the
saint
he
prepared
for
the
feast
with
unusual
devotion
on
the
morning
of
the
when
he
went
to
holy
communion
he
carried
on
his
breast
a
letter
he
had
written
to
our
lady
it
was
such
a
letter
as
a
boy
away
from
home
and
homesick
might
write
to
his
mother
asking
her
to
bring
him
home
after
breakfast
stanislaus
still
in
entire
health
was
sent
to
work
in
the
kitchen
where
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
washing
dishes
carrying
wood
for
the
fire
helping
the
cook
generally
but
by
evening
he
was
decidedly
unwell
to
the
who
helped
him
to
bed
he
said
quietly
i
am
going
to
die
you
know
in
a
few
days
claude
acquaviva
hurried
to
him
as
soon
as
he
learned
he
was
ailing
father
fazio
the
also
came
stanislaus
told
each
of
the
favor
he
had
begged
from
our
lady
and
that
he
hoped
strongly
his
request
would
be
granted
that
was
on
the
evening
of
wednesday
the
he
appeared
to
be
no
better
or
worse
on
thursday
and
friday
but
friday
evening
he
was
moved
from
his
ordinary
room
to
a
quieter
place
in
a
higher
story
of
the
house
those
who
went
with
him
noted
that
before
he
lay
down
he
knelt
on
the
floor
and
prayed
a
while
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
the
bed
saying
this
is
my
deathbed
now
they
began
to
believe
him
and
were
frightened
a
little
so
stanislaus
added
with
a
smile
i
mean
of
course
if
it
so
please
god
he
continued
in
about
the
same
condition
until
sunday
august
that
day
he
said
to
the
laybrother
who
was
taking
care
of
him
brother
i
going
to
die
the
brother
laughed
at
him
and
said
nonsense
man
why
it
would
take
a
greater
miracle
to
die
of
so
trifling
a
matter
than
to
be
cured
of
it
but
by
noon
of
that
day
stanislaus
became
unconscious
father
fazio
was
with
him
at
once
and
administered
restoratives
very
soon
stanislaus
was
himself
again
bright
and
smiling
as
ever
father
fazio
began
to
joke
with
him
o
man
of
little
heart
he
said
to
give
up
courage
in
so
slight
a
sickness
stanislaus
answered
a
man
of
little
heart
i
admit
i
am
but
the
sickness
father
is
not
so
very
slight
since
i
going
to
die
of
it
and
indeed
he
began
to
fail
rapidly
by
evening
the
stood
out
upon
him
the
vital
warmth
little
by
little
withdrew
from
hands
and
feet
to
the
citadel
of
his
heart
when
the
last
light
of
day
was
gone
from
the
sky
he
made
his
confession
and
received
the
holy
viaticum
a
great
many
of
his
were
present
and
some
wept
he
was
a
good
comrade
they
did
not
want
to
see
him
depart
from
them
then
he
received
extreme
unction
he
made
the
answers
to
the
prayers
himself
afterward
he
confessed
again
in
order
to
receive
the
plenary
indulgence
granted
for
the
hour
of
death
and
after
that
he
talked
for
a
little
time
kindly
and
cheerfully
to
those
about
him
and
bidding
them
turned
his
mind
and
his
heart
to
heaven
three
fathers
stayed
with
him
through
the
silence
of
the
night
when
the
rest
had
gone
to
bed
most
of
the
time
he
prayed
either
aloud
with
his
watchers
or
silently
by
himself
he
left
messages
to
his
more
intimate
friends
and
asked
the
fathers
to
beg
pardon
for
any
offense
he
had
given
during
the
evening
he
had
begged
to
be
laid
on
the
bare
ground
that
he
might
die
as
a
penitent
toward
midnight
as
he
still
asked
it
they
lifted
him
on
the
little
mattress
of
his
bed
and
placed
him
on
it
upon
the
floor
there
he
lay
very
quiet
whilst
midnight
tolled
from
the
great
churches
of
the
city
the
fathers
knelt
beside
him
praying
silently
with
him
or
giving
him
from
time
to
time
the
crucifix
to
kiss
at
length
about
three
in
the
morning
he
stopped
praying
and
a
great
joy
shone
in
his
face
he
looked
about
him
from
side
to
side
and
seemed
with
his
eyes
to
ask
his
companions
to
join
him
in
reverencing
some
one
who
was
present
father
ruiz
bent
over
and
asked
him
what
is
it
stanislaus
our
lady
he
whispered
our
lady
has
come
just
as
in
vienna
then
he
seemed
to
listen
to
voices
they
could
not
hear
his
lips
moved
silently
forming
inaudible
words
his
eyes
were
bright
and
joyful
he
stretched
out
his
arms
fell
back
and
died
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
our
lady
had
come
for
him
and
with
her
he
went
home
dawn
was
breaking
on
the
feast
of
the
assumption
chapter
xv
aftermath
stanislaus
lacked
six
or
eight
weeks
of
being
eighteen
years
old
when
he
died
he
had
not
been
a
preacher
or
writer
or
engaged
in
any
public
work
only
a
handful
of
people
in
rome
so
much
as
knew
of
his
existence
yet
no
sooner
was
he
dead
than
crowds
flocked
about
him
as
about
a
dead
saint
the
general
francis
borgia
ordered
the
body
to
be
put
into
a
coffin
which
was
an
unusual
thing
at
that
time
and
to
be
buried
at
the
right
hand
of
the
high
altar
in
the
church
meantime
the
lord
john
kostka
still
raged
in
poland
he
had
written
a
most
severe
letter
to
stanislaus
shortly
after
stanislaus
arrived
in
rome
a
letter
full
of
threats
and
anger
to
which
stanislaus
had
replied
kindly
and
affectionately
explaining
to
his
father
that
he
had
to
follow
god
call
at
any
cost
but
the
lord
john
was
not
to
be
so
easily
put
off
he
ordered
his
eldest
son
paul
on
to
rome
with
power
to
bring
back
stanislaus
to
his
home
at
kostkov
paul
traveled
in
some
state
and
with
no
great
haste
he
reached
rome
in
the
middle
of
september
to
find
that
god
had
been
beforehand
with
him
and
that
stanislaus
had
indeed
already
gone
home
to
heaven
he
had
been
greatly
impressed
at
the
time
of
stanislaus
flight
from
vienna
by
the
incidents
which
seemed
to
show
god
direct
guidance
and
protection
in
regard
to
his
brother
now
when
the
fathers
led
him
to
the
still
new
tomb
of
stanislaus
he
broke
down
utterly
and
cried
like
a
child
he
stayed
a
time
beside
the
tomb
and
when
he
came
forth
he
was
a
different
paul
every
one
was
talking
with
admiration
of
stanislaus
and
of
the
marvels
that
had
surrounded
his
life
and
death
paul
hurried
back
to
poland
with
his
story
at
once
sad
and
joyful
the
heart
of
the
old
castellan
was
moved
he
had
lost
a
son
but
he
had
gained
a
saint
a
year
later
appeared
two
short
lives
of
stanislaus
one
in
polish
by
father
warscewiski
his
another
in
latin
all
through
poland
the
devotion
to
the
young
novice
spread
rapidly
soon
authoritative
processes
toward
his
beatification
were
drawn
up
under
the
care
of
the
bishops
of
various
places
in
which
stanislaus
had
spent
his
short
years
years
after
his
death
pope
clement
viii
issued
a
brief
february
in
which
he
declared
stanislaus
blessed
and
granted
indulgences
on
the
anniversary
of
his
death
but
long
before
this
the
lord
john
had
died
and
his
youngest
son
albert
struck
by
sudden
congestion
of
the
lungs
before
his
body
was
laid
to
rest
died
also
and
was
buried
in
the
same
grave
with
him
of
the
four
sons
only
paul
was
left
from
the
day
he
stood
by
the
tomb
of
stanislaus
he
had
changed
entirely
bitter
remembrance
of
his
harshness
and
brutality
to
the
dead
saint
was
with
him
always
and
urged
him
to
a
life
of
penance
and
prayer
he
never
married
but
passed
his
days
largely
at
the
castle
of
kostkov
in
retirement
with
his
widowed
mother
he
busied
himself
in
constant
works
of
charity
spending
his
great
fortune
in
helping
the
poor
and
in
establishing
hospitals
and
building
churches
he
wore
himself
out
in
prayer
and
labor
and
fasting
men
marveled
at
him
and
many
sneered
at
him
as
he
had
once
sneered
at
stanislaus
but
those
long
hard
years
were
not
unhappy
for
him
he
and
his
mother
margaret
kostka
had
learned
stanislaus
secret
of
happiness
and
lived
in
spirit
in
that
bright
home
to
which
stanislaus
had
gone
then
margaret
died
and
paul
was
alone
he
had
wished
to
withdraw
from
the
world
altogether
but
he
felt
unworthy
to
ask
admission
into
a
religious
order
however
realizing
at
length
that
his
death
could
not
be
far
distant
and
that
he
could
at
worst
be
a
burden
for
only
a
very
short
time
he
wrote
to
claude
acquaviva
who
was
then
general
of
the
society
of
jesus
and
begged
that
he
might
at
least
die
in
the
society
to
which
stanislaus
had
belonged
acquaviva
readily
dispensed
with
the
impediment
of
age
and
ordered
the
provincial
of
poland
father
strinieno
to
receive
him
paul
hastened
to
the
royal
court
then
at
pietscop
to
settle
his
worldly
affairs
before
taking
up
his
residence
in
the
noviceship
but
scarcely
had
he
completed
his
arrangements
when
fever
seized
him
and
he
died
after
a
few
days
illness
he
died
november
the
very
day
of
the
month
afterwards
fixed
as
the
feast
of
saint
stanislaus
bilinski
too
the
tutor
of
stanislaus
showed
in
after
life
the
fruit
of
stanislaus
prayers
he
became
canon
of
pultowa
and
plock
and
lived
holily
it
was
his
privilege
to
bear
testimony
to
many
events
in
the
life
of
stanislaus
and
he
was
a
very
valuable
witness
in
the
processes
for
his
pupil
beatification
when
death
came
stanislaus
appeared
to
him
in
vision
consoling
and
encouraging
him
and
he
died
in
great
peace
all
this
time
the
people
of
poland
had
been
eager
in
their
devotion
to
the
blessed
stanislaus
many
cures
and
miracles
had
been
wrought
through
his
intercession
in
under
the
polish
king
sigismund
iii
and
again
in
under
yan
sobieski
the
poles
won
pronounced
victories
over
turkish
armies
which
far
outnumbered
their
own
and
attributed
these
preternatural
successes
to
the
prayers
of
stanislaus
the
whole
nation
through
its
kings
repeatedly
petitioned
that
stanislaus
might
be
declared
their
patron
this
was
at
first
refused
as
only
canonized
saints
were
given
the
title
of
patron
of
a
nation
but
clement
x
granted
the
request
in
setting
aside
the
decree
which
forbade
it
the
church
is
slow
in
declaring
any
one
a
saint
it
was
not
until
december
one
hundred
and
years
after
the
death
of
stanislaus
that
benedict
xiii
solemnly
celebrated
his
canonization
in
the
basilica
of
peter
it
was
a
double
ceremony
for
it
was
also
the
occasion
of
the
canonization
of
saint
aloysius
who
had
been
born
in
march
of
the
same
year
in
which
stanislaus
died
this
little
account
has
not
done
justice
to
the
life
of
stanislaus
kostka
and
indeed
it
is
very
hard
to
do
justice
to
it
he
was
a
most
human
and
lovable
boy
but
he
was
besides
a
wonderful
bright
being
that
eludes
the
grip
of
our
common
minds
he
was
a
citizen
of
heaven
who
lived
here
amongst
us
kindly
and
companionable
indeed
during
eighteen
years
of
exile
to
try
to
describe
him
is
like
trying
to
describe
a
star
in
the
far
sky
of
night
that
love
for
god
of
which
we
speak
so
brokenly
which
at
its
best
in
us
is
so
small
and
cold
was
the
soul
of
his
soul
the
inner
core
and
substance
of
his
life
here
in
the
misty
country
of
faith
he
had
something
of
that
radiant
and
rapturous
union
with
god
which
all
of
us
as
we
hope
shall
one
day
have
in
heaven
all
the
sweet
and
strong
twining
of
our
hearts
about
father
and
mother
and
relatives
and
dear
friends
all
that
binds
us
in
affection
to
those
we
love
in
life
was
multiplied
and
made
many
times
stronger
in
his
rare
nature
and
lifted
up
by
god
grace
to
fix
itself
upon
god
the
infinite
goodness
the
supreme
beauty
god
was
not
a
mere
name
or
a
power
to
him
not
even
the
mere
lord
and
master
of
all
god
was
his
friend
his
dearest
intimate
his
sure
strong
patient
loving
counselor
whose
presence
was
with
him
waking
and
sleeping
whose
interests
were
nearest
his
heart
whose
commands
it
was
a
delight
to
obey
whose
slightest
wish
and
beckoning
was
eagerly
watched
for
and
joyously
followed
to
catch
the
secret
and
true
meaning
of
his
life
one
must
feel
how
that
love
for
god
thrilled
through
him
was
his
courage
in
action
his
endurance
in
suffering
his
sweetness
and
kindness
in
all
dealings
with
other
men
it
was
his
life
and
when
we
have
said
and
realized
that
we
have
come
nearest
to
knowing
who
and
what
really
was
stanislaus
kostka
