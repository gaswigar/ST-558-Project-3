chapter
i
cast
thy
bread
upon
the
waters
the
room
was
very
full
children
large
and
small
boys
and
girls
and
some
looking
almost
old
enough
to
be
called
men
and
women
filled
the
seats
the
scholars
had
just
finished
singing
their
hymn
happy
land
and
the
superintendent
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
spying
out
classes
here
and
there
which
were
without
teachers
and
supplying
them
from
the
visitors
seat
which
was
up
by
the
desk
the
long
seat
near
the
door
was
filled
this
morning
by
half
a
dozen
dirty
ragged
barefooted
boys
their
teacher
seat
was
vacant
and
those
boys
looked
every
one
as
though
they
had
come
thither
just
to
have
a
grand
frolic
oh
such
bright
cunning
wicked
faces
as
they
had
their
torn
pants
and
jackets
their
matted
hair
even
the
very
twinkle
in
their
eyes
showed
that
they
were
the
mission
class
that
is
the
class
which
somebody
had
gathered
from
the
little
black
houses
which
thronged
a
narrow
back
street
of
that
village
and
coaxed
to
come
to
the
sabbath
school
to
this
large
light
pleasant
room
where
the
sun
shone
in
upon
little
girls
in
white
dresses
with
blue
and
pink
ribbons
fluttering
from
their
shoulders
and
upon
little
boys
whose
snowy
linen
collars
and
dainty
knots
of
black
ribbon
had
evidently
been
arranged
by
careful
hands
that
very
morning
but
those
boys
in
the
corner
kicked
their
bare
heels
together
pulled
each
other
hair
or
laughed
in
each
other
faces
in
the
greatest
good
humour
the
superintendent
stopped
before
them
well
boys
good
morning
glad
to
see
you
all
here
where
your
teacher
hai
got
none
answered
one
gone
to
guinea
said
another
she
was
afraid
of
us
explained
a
third
tip
here
put
his
foot
through
one
of
her
lace
flounces
last
sunday
tip
the
worst
boy
got
anyhow
the
boys
all
seemed
to
think
this
was
very
funny
for
they
laughed
so
loudly
that
the
little
girls
at
their
right
looked
over
to
see
what
was
the
matter
tip
ran
his
fingers
through
his
uncombed
hair
and
laughed
with
the
rest
well
said
the
superintendent
i
going
to
get
you
a
teacher
one
you
will
like
i
guess
i
shall
expect
you
to
treat
her
well
there
was
just
one
person
left
on
the
visitors
seat
a
young
lady
who
looked
shy
and
quiet
oh
parker
she
said
when
the
superintendent
told
her
what
he
wanted
i
ca
take
that
class
i
watched
those
boys
ever
since
they
came
in
they
look
mischievous
enough
for
anything
and
act
as
they
look
then
shall
we
leave
them
with
nothing
but
mischief
to
take
up
their
attention
no
but
they
really
ought
to
have
a
better
teacher
than
i
some
one
who
knows
how
to
interest
them
but
miss
perry
the
choice
lies
between
you
and
no
one
and
while
she
still
hesitated
and
looked
distressed
parker
bent
forward
a
little
and
said
softly
as
ye
did
it
not
to
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
ye
did
it
not
to
me
the
lady
rose
quickly
and
gathered
her
mantle
about
her
i
will
go
parker
she
said
speaking
quickly
as
if
afraid
her
courage
would
fail
her
since
there
is
no
one
else
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
but
oh
i
am
afraid
down
the
long
room
past
the
rows
of
attentive
children
parker
led
her
to
the
seat
near
the
door
now
boys
said
he
this
is
miss
perry
suppose
you
see
if
you
all
be
gentlemen
and
treat
her
well
miss
perry
sat
down
in
the
teacher
chair
her
heart
all
in
a
flutter
she
taught
a
class
in
her
own
sabbath
school
hundreds
of
miles
away
five
little
girls
gathered
around
her
every
sabbath
but
they
were
little
girls
whose
mothers
had
taught
them
to
love
their
lessons
to
listen
respectfully
to
what
their
teacher
said
to
bow
their
heads
reverently
in
prayer
and
more
than
that
they
loved
her
and
she
loved
them
but
these
boys
still
she
must
say
something
six
pairs
of
bright
roguish
eyes
brimful
of
fire
and
fun
were
bent
on
her
boys
she
said
gently
have
you
any
lessons
for
me
not
much
answered
bob
turner
who
always
spoke
first
we
do
get
lessons
mostly
do
come
unless
it
too
hot
to
go
fishing
or
berrying
tip
comes
he
too
lazy
to
go
past
the
door
i
do
drawled
out
the
boy
they
called
tip
i
come
to
get
out
of
the
sun
it
hotter
than
sixty
down
home
never
mind
boys
said
their
frightened
teacher
for
they
were
all
laughing
now
as
though
the
funniest
thing
in
the
world
had
happened
see
here
since
you
have
no
lessons
shall
i
tell
you
a
story
oh
yes
they
were
willing
enough
to
hear
a
story
if
it
was
stupid
i
tell
you
something
that
happened
to
a
boy
when
he
was
about
thirteen
years
old
his
name
is
robert
he
told
me
this
story
himself
so
you
may
be
sure
it
true
he
said
one
evening
he
was
walking
slowly
down
the
main
street
of
the
village
where
he
lived
where
was
that
asked
bob
turner
oh
it
was
away
out
west
he
said
he
felt
cross
and
unhappy
he
had
nowhere
in
particular
to
go
and
nothing
to
do
as
he
walked
he
came
to
a
turn
where
two
roads
met
thought
he
i
turn
to
the
left
and
go
home
and
hang
around
until
or
shall
i
turn
to
the
right
and
go
down
to
the
river
awhile
you
see
robert
had
a
happy
home
his
mother
was
dead
and
his
father
was
a
drunkard
while
he
stood
thinking
a
boy
came
around
the
other
corner
and
called
out
going
home
rob
know
said
robert
ca
make
up
my
mind
you
come
on
down
to
our
house
and
we
have
a
game
of
ball
still
robert
waited
he
was
fond
of
playing
ball
that
was
certain
and
he
liked
company
better
than
to
walk
alone
why
he
should
think
of
wandering
off
down
to
the
river
by
himself
he
was
sure
he
know
still
something
seemed
to
keep
saying
to
him
this
way
turn
to
the
right
come
go
to
the
river
he
said
at
last
i
guess
i
take
a
walk
this
way
first
and
he
turned
the
corner
then
he
was
but
a
few
steps
from
the
river
what
came
of
the
other
fellow
asked
bob
why
some
more
boys
came
up
just
then
and
he
walked
along
with
them
there
was
a
large
on
the
river
bank
and
there
was
one
particular
spot
under
it
that
robert
called
his
seat
but
he
found
a
gentleman
seated
there
this
time
he
had
a
book
in
his
hand
partly
closed
and
he
was
leaning
back
against
a
tree
watching
the
sunset
he
looked
around
as
he
heard
robert
step
and
said
evening
will
you
have
a
seat
he
moved
along
and
robert
sat
down
on
the
grass
near
him
then
he
said
heard
a
boy
call
out
to
another
just
now
going
home
robert
are
you
the
boy
said
robert
carter
screamed
that
out
to
me
just
as
he
came
round
the
corner
you
are
the
one
he
was
talking
to
well
i
ask
you
the
same
question
you
going
home
said
robert
again
have
just
walked
straight
away
from
home
but
are
you
going
up
and
the
gentleman
pointed
up
to
the
blue
sky
the
home
i
mean
i
just
been
reading
about
it
this
river
made
me
think
of
it
where
it
says
you
know
and
he
showed
me
a
pure
river
of
water
clear
as
crystal
then
it
goes
on
to
describe
the
city
with
its
gates
of
pearl
and
streets
of
gold
the
robes
and
crowns
that
the
people
wear
the
harps
on
which
they
play
and
after
this
warm
day
i
could
help
thinking
that
one
of
the
pleasantest
things
about
this
home
was
the
promise
neither
shall
the
sun
light
on
them
nor
any
heat
are
you
going
to
that
home
my
boy
do
know
robert
said
feeling
very
much
astonished
at
this
point
the
superintendent
bell
rang
and
miss
perry
had
to
hasten
her
story
i
have
time
boys
to
tell
you
all
the
gentleman
said
but
after
that
talk
robert
began
to
think
about
these
things
a
great
deal
and
pretty
soon
he
learned
to
read
the
bible
and
to
pray
that
was
more
than
fifty
years
ago
he
is
an
old
minister
now
i
have
heard
him
preach
a
great
many
times
and
he
told
me
once
he
should
always
believe
god
put
it
into
his
heart
to
turn
to
the
right
that
evening
instead
of
the
left
oh
exclaimed
tip
just
here
and
miss
perry
stopped
joe
pinched
me
said
tip
to
explain
his
part
of
the
noise
but
their
teacher
felt
very
badly
they
had
not
listened
to
her
story
as
though
they
cared
to
hear
it
they
had
slid
up
and
down
the
seat
pulled
and
pinched
and
pricked
each
other
and
done
a
great
many
mischievous
things
since
she
commenced
and
yet
now
and
then
they
seemed
to
hear
a
few
words
so
she
kept
on
because
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
oh
parker
she
said
when
the
school
was
dismissed
and
her
noisy
class
had
scrambled
some
through
the
window
and
some
through
the
door
some
man
who
understands
boys
ought
to
have
had
that
class
i
done
them
any
good
but
i
tried
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
you
did
what
you
could
said
the
superintendent
kindly
none
of
us
can
do
more
some
loving
voice
ought
to
have
whispered
in
that
teacher
ear
he
that
goeth
forth
and
weepeth
bearing
precious
seed
shall
doubtless
come
again
with
rejoicing
bringing
his
sheaves
with
him
chapter
ii
but
other
fell
into
good
ground
and
brought
forth
fruit
tip
lewis
yawned
and
stretched
and
finally
opened
his
eyes
rather
late
on
monday
morning
oh
bother
he
said
with
another
yawn
when
he
saw
how
the
sun
was
pouring
into
the
room
i
suppose
a
fellow
has
got
to
get
up
i
wish
getting
up
was
such
hard
work
spoils
all
the
fun
of
going
to
bed
but
then
the
old
cat
will
be
to
pay
if
i
do
get
around
soon
and
with
this
he
rolled
out
and
when
he
was
dressed
which
was
in
a
very
few
minutes
after
he
tumbled
out
of
his
ragged
bed
he
was
the
tip
who
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
most
of
the
mischief
in
miss
class
the
day
before
the
very
same
from
the
curly
hair
not
yet
combed
nor
likely
to
be
down
to
the
bare
soiled
feet
the
bed
which
he
had
just
left
so
far
as
neatness
was
concerned
looked
very
much
like
tip
and
the
room
looked
like
the
bed
and
they
all
looked
about
as
badly
as
dust
and
rags
and
poverty
could
make
them
look
after
running
his
fingers
through
his
hair
by
way
of
finishing
his
toilet
tip
made
his
way
down
the
rickety
stairs
to
the
kitchen
it
seemed
as
though
that
kitchen
was
just
calculated
to
make
a
boy
feel
cross
the
table
stood
against
the
wall
on
its
three
legs
the
tablecloth
was
daubed
with
molasses
and
stained
with
gravy
a
plate
with
something
in
it
which
looked
like
melted
lard
but
which
mother
called
butter
and
a
half
loaf
of
bread
were
the
only
eatable
articles
as
yet
on
the
table
and
around
these
the
flies
had
gathered
in
such
numbers
that
it
almost
seemed
as
though
they
might
carry
the
loaf
away
entirely
if
too
many
of
them
did
drown
themselves
in
the
butter
over
all
the
july
sun
poured
in
its
rays
from
the
eastern
window
the
only
one
in
the
room
tip
stumbled
over
his
father
boots
and
made
his
way
to
the
stove
where
his
mother
was
bending
over
a
spider
of
sizzling
pork
well
she
said
as
he
came
near
did
you
get
up
for
all
day
i
be
ashamed
great
boy
like
you
to
lie
in
bed
till
this
time
of
day
and
let
your
mother
split
wood
and
bring
water
to
cook
your
breakfast
with
you
cooked
a
little
for
you
too
did
you
asked
tip
in
a
saucy
tone
where
father
just
where
you
have
been
all
day
so
far
in
bed
and
asleep
such
folks
as
i
got
i
sick
of
living
and
lewis
stepped
back
from
the
steaming
and
wiped
great
beads
of
perspiration
from
her
forehead
then
fanned
herself
with
her
big
apron
looking
meantime
very
tired
and
cross
yet
tip
mother
was
not
so
cross
after
all
as
she
seemed
had
tip
only
known
it
her
heart
was
very
heavy
that
morning
she
did
not
blame
his
father
for
his
morning
nap
not
a
bit
of
it
she
was
only
glad
that
the
weary
frame
could
rest
a
little
after
a
night
of
pain
she
had
been
up
since
the
first
grey
dawn
of
morning
bathing
his
head
straightening
the
tangled
bedclothes
walking
the
floor
with
the
restless
baby
in
order
that
her
husband
might
have
quiet
oh
no
there
were
worse
women
in
the
world
than
lewis
but
this
morning
her
life
looked
very
wretched
to
her
she
thought
of
her
idle
mischievous
boy
of
her
naughty
little
girl
of
her
fat
healthy
baby
who
took
so
much
of
her
time
of
her
husband
who
though
she
never
said
it
to
him
or
even
to
herself
yet
she
knew
and
felt
was
every
day
growing
weaker
and
with
these
came
the
remembrance
that
her
own
tired
hands
were
all
that
lay
between
them
and
want
and
it
is
hardly
a
wonder
that
her
voice
was
sharp
and
her
words
ill
chosen
for
this
mother
tried
to
bear
all
her
trials
alone
she
never
went
for
help
to
the
redeemer
who
said
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
wah
said
johnny
from
his
cradle
in
the
bit
of
a
bedroom
near
the
kitchen
which
kitchen
was
all
the
room
they
had
save
two
tiny
bedrooms
and
tip
little
den
lewis
glanced
quickly
towards
the
door
of
her
husband
room
it
was
closed
then
she
called
kitty
make
that
baby
go
to
sleep
oh
yes
muttered
kitty
who
sat
on
the
floor
lacing
her
old
shoe
with
a
white
cord
it
easy
to
say
that
but
i
just
like
to
see
you
do
it
ah
yah
answered
johnny
from
the
cradle
as
though
he
tried
to
say
so
should
i
then
not
being
noticed
he
gave
up
pretending
to
cry
and
screamed
in
good
earnest
loud
positive
yells
which
brought
his
mother
in
haste
from
the
kitchen
ugly
girl
she
said
to
kitty
as
she
lifted
the
conquering
hero
from
his
cradle
you
do
care
how
soon
your
father
is
waked
out
of
the
only
nap
he
has
had
all
night
why
did
you
rock
the
cradle
i
a
notion
to
whip
you
this
minute
i
did
answered
kitty
sulkily
and
he
opened
his
eyes
at
me
as
wide
as
he
could
stretch
them
crash
went
something
at
that
moment
in
the
kitchen
and
with
johnny
in
her
arms
lewis
ran
back
to
see
what
new
trouble
she
had
to
meet
tip
meantime
had
been
in
business
being
hungry
he
had
cut
a
slice
of
bread
from
the
loaf
and
in
the
act
of
reaching
over
to
help
himself
to
some
butter
hit
his
arm
against
a
pitcher
of
water
standing
on
the
corner
of
the
table
over
it
went
and
broke
just
as
pitchers
will
whenever
they
get
a
chance
this
was
too
much
for
the
tired
patience
what
little
she
had
vanished
she
tossed
the
slice
of
bread
at
tip
and
as
she
did
so
said
there
take
that
and
be
off
do
let
me
see
a
sight
of
your
face
again
march
this
instant
or
you
will
wish
you
had
and
in
the
midst
of
the
din
while
his
mother
looked
after
the
pork
which
had
seized
this
occasion
for
burning
fast
to
the
spider
tip
managed
to
spread
his
slice
of
bread
find
his
hat
and
make
good
his
escape
from
the
comfortless
home
there
was
an
hour
yet
to
or
for
the
matter
of
that
he
might
have
the
whole
day
tip
went
to
school
or
let
it
alone
just
as
he
pleased
he
made
his
way
straight
to
his
favourite
spot
the
broad
deep
pond
and
laid
himself
down
on
its
grassy
bank
to
chat
with
the
fishes
my
he
said
how
nice
they
look
whisking
about
it
cool
down
there
i
know
they
do
mind
the
sun
i
wish
i
had
my
here
i
have
one
of
them
shiny
big
fellows
there
for
my
dinner
only
it
too
hot
to
fish
and
it
would
seem
kind
of
mean
besides
to
get
him
up
here
in
this
blazing
sun
hang
me
if
i
make
even
a
fish
get
out
of
the
water
when
it
can
stay
in
of
all
the
scholars
in
miss
perry
class
the
one
who
she
would
have
said
paid
the
least
attention
was
this
same
boy
who
was
lying
on
his
face
by
the
pond
envying
the
fishes
yet
tip
had
heard
nearly
every
word
she
said
and
now
as
he
looked
into
the
water
which
lay
cool
in
the
shade
of
some
broad
branching
trees
there
came
into
his
heart
the
music
of
those
words
again
neither
shall
the
sun
light
on
them
nor
any
heat
i
declare
he
said
as
the
meaning
of
those
words
dawned
upon
him
like
that
they
never
be
too
warm
again
it
was
a
pretty
nice
story
she
told
us
about
that
boy
he
could
have
had
a
very
good
time
his
father
was
a
drunkard
i
wish
i
knew
just
about
what
kind
of
a
fellow
he
was
he
turned
right
square
round
after
that
man
talked
to
him
now
he
is
a
minister
i
suppose
lots
of
people
like
him
it
must
be
kind
of
nice
the
whole
of
it
i
would
like
to
be
somebody
as
true
as
i
live
i
would
i
like
to
have
the
people
say
goes
tip
lewis
he
the
best
boy
in
town
bless
me
that
would
be
funny
i
do
believe
they
could
ever
say
it
they
are
so
used
to
calling
me
the
worst
they
could
help
it
what
if
i
should
reform
i
declare
i
do
know
but
i
will
and
tip
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
looked
up
into
the
blue
cloudless
sky
lying
there
he
certainly
had
some
of
the
most
sober
thoughts
perhaps
the
only
really
sober
ones
he
had
ever
known
in
his
life
and
when
at
last
he
slowly
picked
himself
up
turned
his
back
upon
the
darting
fishes
and
walked
towards
the
he
had
in
his
mind
some
vague
notion
that
perhaps
he
would
be
different
from
that
time
forth
just
what
he
was
going
to
do
or
how
to
commence
doing
it
he
did
know
but
the
story
to
which
he
had
seemed
not
to
listen
at
all
had
crept
into
his
heart
had
commenced
its
work
very
dimly
was
it
working
very
blindly
he
might
grope
for
a
while
but
the
seed
sown
had
taken
root
chapter
iii
inasmuch
as
ye
did
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
ye
did
it
unto
me
around
the
corner
and
far
up
the
street
from
where
tip
lewis
lived
there
stood
a
large
white
house
not
another
house
in
the
village
was
so
beautiful
as
this
many
a
time
had
tip
walked
slowly
by
the
place
and
cast
the
most
admiring
glances
on
the
broad
green
lawns
and
bubbling
fountain
of
which
he
caught
glimpses
from
the
road
often
he
had
stood
outside
at
the
great
gate
and
fairly
for
a
nearer
view
of
that
same
fountain
for
the
truth
was
though
he
was
such
a
rough
yes
a
boy
down
in
his
heart
he
had
a
great
love
for
beautiful
things
on
this
fourth
of
july
morning
tip
was
up
and
abroad
very
early
he
held
a
horse
which
had
been
so
frightened
by
that
it
stand
still
a
minute
and
the
owner
of
it
gave
him
ten
cents
with
which
he
immediately
bought
for
himself
and
frightened
the
very
next
horse
he
saw
when
the
great
cannon
on
the
hill
was
fired
he
got
in
the
way
just
as
much
as
he
knew
how
which
was
a
great
deal
he
contrived
to
be
around
when
the
largest
bell
was
rung
and
add
his
voice
to
the
uproar
among
the
boys
who
were
gathered
around
the
church
doors
indeed
wherever
there
was
commotion
or
confusion
tip
managed
very
soon
to
be
and
to
do
his
part
towards
making
the
most
of
it
about
ten
he
had
lived
out
the
most
of
his
pleasures
having
been
on
hand
since
a
little
after
three
he
had
no
more
money
to
spend
saw
no
chance
of
getting
any
more
he
had
had
no
breakfast
and
was
very
much
in
doubt
as
to
whether
he
would
get
any
if
he
took
the
trouble
to
go
home
he
had
some
way
lost
track
of
all
his
companions
and
altogether
he
was
beginning
to
feel
as
if
the
fourth
of
july
were
a
humbug
he
felt
angry
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
being
cheated
out
of
a
good
time
that
he
expected
to
have
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
an
old
and
thought
about
it
a
while
then
finally
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
whistling
yankee
doodle
in
honour
of
the
day
he
sauntered
along
the
street
in
search
of
something
to
take
up
his
time
hurrying
towards
him
with
hands
not
in
his
pockets
but
full
of
packages
came
mintum
the
owner
of
the
grand
white
house
on
the
hill
to
tip
surprise
the
gentleman
halted
suddenly
before
him
and
eyeing
him
closely
asked
whose
boy
are
you
john
lewis
where
do
you
live
side
of
the
pond
by
the
mill
oh
your
father
is
the
carpenter
i
suppose
i
know
him
your
name
tip
tip
what
kind
of
a
name
is
that
is
it
all
the
one
you
own
well
said
tip
i
suppose
my
name
was
edward
when
i
was
a
little
shaver
but
nobody
knows
it
now
i
do
myself
well
tip
then
i
call
you
that
for
i
want
you
to
know
yourself

to

some
fun

i
can
find

that
what

to
my
house
at
dark
and

you
can
find
it
there
we
are
going
to
have
fireworks
and
songs
and
all
the
fun
we
can
tip
was
not
by
any
means
a
bashful
boy
and
it
took
a
great
deal
to
astonish
him
but
this
sudden
invitation
almost
took
his
breath
away
the
idea
that
minturn
had
actually
invited
tip
lewis
to
come
to
the
white
house
to
come
near
to
that
wonderful
fountain
near
enough
perhaps
to
feel
the
dash
of
its
spray
he
could
have
danced
for
joy
yet
when
minturn
said
well
will
you
come
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
known
to
stammer
and
hesitate
i
i
do
know
i
have
got
any
clothes
clothes
repeated
minturn
what
do
you
call
those
things
which
you
have
on
i
call
sir
answered
tip
his
embarrassment
gone
and
the
mischief
twinkling
back
into
his
face
again
minturn
laughed
and
looked
down
on
the
torn
jacket
and
pants
not
a
bad
name
he
said
at
last
but
you
got
water
at
your
house
have
you
lots
of
it
then
put
your
head
into
a
tub
of
it
and
a
clean
face
up
to
my
house
and
we
try
and
find
that
fun
you
looking
for
and
minturn
who
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
for
him
was
passing
on
see

called

he
had
moved
forward
a
few
steps

soon
as
the
gentleman
was
at
safe
distance

this
is
rich
then
i
do
know

that
great
yard

near

bob

enough
sight
more
holes
in
it
than
mine
has
oh
ho
ai
it
grand
though
and
tip
clapped
his
hands
and
whistled
and
at
last
finding
that
did
express
his
feeling
said
hurrah
in
a
good
strong
tone
yes
hurrah
tip
is
right
it
is
glorious
to
think
that
one
man
out
of
his
abundance
is
going
to
open
his
heart
and
gather
in
god
poor
and
for
one
evening
at
least
make
them
happy
god
bless
minturn
never
had
the
good
man
grounds
entertained
such
a
group
as
from
all
quarters
of
the
large
town
gathered
before
it
was
quite
dark
ragged
boys
and
girls
if
those
were
what
be
wanted
he
had
them
sure
enough
of
almost
every
age
and
size
there
were
some
not
so
ragged
some
in
dainty
white
dresses
and
shining
jackets
but
they
went
down
and
mingled
with
the
others
brothers
and
sisters
for
that
night
at
least
and
were
all
oh
happy
how
they
dance
and
laugh
and
scream
around
that
fountain
and
snap
torpedoes
and
and
shout
with
wild
delight
when
the
rockets
shot
up
into
the
sky
or
the
burning
wheels
span
round
and
round
scattering
showers
of
real
fire
right
in
among
the
crowds
of
children
well
the
evening
hasted
away
the
very
last
rocket
took
its
bright
rushing
way
up
into
the
blue
sky
and
minturn
gathered
his
company
around
the
piazza
with
the
words
now
children
holbrook
has
a
few
words
to
say
to
you
and
after
that
as
soon
as
we
have
sung
a
hymn
it
will
be
time
to
go
home
holbrook
was
the
minister
many
of
the
children
knew
him
well
and
most
of
them
were
ready
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
because
they
knew
by
experience
that
he
was
old
enough
and
wise
enough
not
to
make
a
long
dry
speech
after
nine
on
the
fourth
of
july
only
tip
as
he
turned
longingly
away
from
the
last
dying
spark
of
the
rocket
muttered
bother
the
preaching
holbrook
came
forward
to
the
steps
as
the
boys
and
girls
gathered
around
him
children
said
he
we
have
had
a
good
time
have
we
yes
sir
came
in
a
loud
chorus
from
many
voices
yes
i
thought
you
acted
as
though
you
felt
pretty
happy
now
this
has
been
a
busy
day
and
we
are
all
tired
so
i
not
going
to
keep
you
here
to
make
a
speech
to
you
i
just
want
to
tell
you
in
as
few
words
as
i
can
what
i
have
been
thinking
about
since
i
stood
here
i
have
watched
you
as
you
frolicked
around
that
fountain
so
many
young
bright
faces
all
looking
so
happy
and
i
said
to
myself
when
the
time
comes
for
us
to
gather
around
that
fountain
of
living
water
which
is
before
the
throne
of
god
i
wonder
if
of
these
boys
and
girls
will
be
missing
of
them
oh
children
i
pray
god
that
you
may
be
there
one
just
a
little
speech
it
was
so
little
that
the
youngest
there
might
almost
remember
the
whole
of
it
yet
it
meant
much
tip
lewis
had
wedged
his
way
in
among
the
boys
until
he
stood
very
near
the
minister
and
his
face
wore
a
sober
thoughtful
look
it
was
only
two
days
since
his
long
talk
with
himself
at
the
pond
fourth
of
july
with
all
the
merrymaking
and
mischief
that
it
brought
to
him
had
nearly
driven
sober
thoughts
from
his
mind
but
the
minister
solemn
words
brought
back
the
memory
of
his
resolves
and
again
he
said
to
himself
he
believed
he
would
reform
this
time
he
added
that
if
he
knew
about
to
do
it
he
would
begin
right
away
he
felt
it
more
than
ever
when
the
sweet
voices
of
many
children
floated
out
on
the
evening
air
as
they
sang
i
have
read
of
a
world
of
beauty
where
there
is
no
gloomy
night
where
love
is
the
mainspring
of
duty
and
god
is
the
fountain
of
light
i
have
read
of
the
flowing
river
that
bursts
from
beneath
the
throne
and
beautiful
flowers
that
ever
are
found
on
its
banks
alone
i
long
i
long
i
long
to
be
there
if
somebody
had
only
known
tip
thoughts
as
he
stood
there
listening
to
the
beautiful
sabbath
school
hymn
if
somebody
had
only
bent
down
to
him
and
whispered
a
few
words
just
to
set
his
poor
wandering
feet
into
the
narrow
way
how
blessed
it
would
have
been
but
nobody
did
ah
never
mind
god
knew
and
took
care
of
him
chapter
iv
they

lewis
room
was
in
order
for
once
swept
and
even
dusted
the
cooled
off
and
the
green
paper
curtain
at
the
window
let
down
to
shut
out
the
noise
and
dust
it
was
quiet
there
too
kitty
stood
in
the
open
door
her
face
and
hands
clean
hair
combed
and
dress
mended
stood
quite
still
and
with
a
sober
face
unmindful
for
once
that
there
were
butterflies
to
chase
and
flies
to
kill
all
around
her
in
the
only
comfortable
seat
in
the
room
a
large
sat
the
worn
wasted
frame
of
kitty
father
there
was
a
look
of
hopeless
sadness
settled
on
his
face
neither
tip
nor
his
mother
were
to
be
seen
one
or
two
women
were
moving
through
the
house
with
quiet
steps
bringing
in
chairs
and
doing
little
thoughtful
things
in
and
about
that
wonderfully
orderly
room
on
the
table
was
that
which
told
the
whole
story
of
this
unusual
stillness
and
preparation
it
was
a
pine
coffin
very
small
and
plain
and
in
it
with
folded
hands
and
brown
hair
rolled
smoothly
back
from
his
baby
forehead
little
johnny
lay
asleep
somebody
with
a
touch
of
tenderness
had
placed
a
just
budding
rose
in
the
tiny
white
hand
and
baby
looked
very
sweet
and
beautiful
in
his
narrow
bed
poor
little
johnny
his
had
been
a
sad
neglected
babyhood
many
weary
hours
had
he
spent
in
his
cradle
receiving
only
cross
looks
from
kitty
and
neglected
by
the
mother
who
though
she
loved
johnny
and
even
because
she
loved
him
must
leave
him
to
work
for
her
daily
bread
but
it
was
all
over
now
johnny
cries
would
never
disturb
them
again
johnny
weary
little
body
rested
quietly
in
its
coffin
johnny
precious
self
was
gathered
in
the
saviour
arms
tip
came
out
of
the
bedroom
and
softly
approached
the
coffin
his
hair
too
was
partly
combed
and
some
attempt
had
been
made
to
put
his
ragged
clothes
in
order
his
heart
swelled
and
the
tears
gathered
in
his
eyes
as
they
rested
on
the
baby
tip
loved
his
little
brother
and
though
he
had
not
had
much
to
do
with
him
yet
he
had
this
much
to
comfort
him
johnny
had
received
only
kindness
and
words
from
him
which
was
more
than
kitty
could
say
as
she
stood
there
in
the
door
it
seemed
to
her
that
every
time
she
had
ever
said
cross
naughty
words
to
the
poor
baby
or
turned
away
from
his
pitiful
cry
for
comfort
or
shook
his
little
helpless
self
came
back
to
her
now
stood
all
around
his
coffin
and
looked
straight
at
her
poor
kitty
thought
if
he
could
come
back
to
them
for
a
little
while
she
would
hold
him
in
her
arms
all
night
without
a
murmur
people
began
to
come
in
now
from
the
lowly
houses
about
them
and
fill
the
empty
chairs
lewis
came
out
from
the
bedroom
and
sat
down
beside
the
thankful
that
her
face
and
swollen
eyes
were
hidden
by
the
thick
black
veil
which
some
thoughtful
neighbour
had
sent
for
her
use
in
a
few
minutes
a
dozen
or
more
people
had
filled
up
the
vacant
spaces
in
the
little
room
and
holbrook
arose
from
his
seat
at
the
coffin
head
tip
turned
quickly
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
and
listened
eagerly
while
he
read
from
the
book
in
his
hand
and
i
saw
the
dead
small
and
great
stand
before
god
listening
until
the
closing
sentence
was
read
and
there
shall
be
no
more
death
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
pain
for
the
former
things
are
passed
away
tip
had
never
paid
such
close
attention
to
anything
in
his
life
as
he
did
to
holbrook
words
after
that
they
were
very
simple
and
plain
spoken
so
that
a
child
might
understand
them
and
were
about
heaven
that
beautiful
city
of
which
tip
had
heard
and
thought
more
during
the
last
three
weeks
than
he
ever
had
in
his
life
before
his
heart
had
been
in
a
constant
struggle
with
satan
ever
since
that
morning
in
the
sabbath
school
he
did
know
enough
to
understand
that
it
was
satan
evil
voice
which
was
constantly
persuading
him
that
he
could
not
be
anybody
was
only
a
poor
miserable
ragged
boy
with
nobody
to
help
him
nobody
to
show
him
what
to
do
that
he
might
as
well
not
try
to
be
anything
but
what
he
was
and
he
did
know
either
that
the
other
voice
in
his
heart
which
struggled
with
the
evil
counsel
which
said
to
him
other
boys
as
poor
and
ignorant
as
you
are
have
reformed
that
robert
did
about
whom
the
teacher
told
you
and
then
if
you
do
you
will
never
see
that
river
nor
the
fountain
nor
the
streets
of
gold
was
the
dear
loving
voice
of
his
redeemer
now
as
he
listened
to
holbrook
and
heard
how
johnny
little
johnny
whom
he
loved
had
surely
gone
up
there
to
be
with
christ
for
ever
and
how
jesus
looking
down
on
the
father
and
mother
and
the
children
who
were
left
said
to
them
i
want
you
too
to
give
me
your
hearts
so
that
when
i
gather
my
jewels
i
may
come
for
you
the
weak
struggling
resolves
in
his
heart
grew
strong
and
he
said
within
himself
while
the
tears
fell
slowly
down
his
cheeks
i
will
i
begin
the
was
screwed
down
and
johnny
shut
out
from
them
for
ever
a
man
came
forward
and
took
the
light
burden
in
his
arms
and
bore
it
out
to
the
waggon
down
the
narrow
street
they
drove
to
the
which
was
not
far
away
they
laid
johnny
down
to
sleep
under
the
shade
of
a
large
old
tree
and
the
grass
waved
softly
and
the
birds
sang
low
and
the
angels
surely
sang
in
heaven
because
another
little
form
was
numbered
among
the
thousands
of
children
who
stand
around
the
throne
the
people
moved
slowly
from
the
grave
all
but
tip
he
did
want
to
leave
johnny
he
wanted
to
follow
him
and
he
did
know
how
holbrook
glanced
back
at
the
boy
standing
there
alone
paused
a
moment
then
turning
back
laid
his
hand
gently
on
tip
shoulder
you
can
go
up
there
too
my
boy
if
you
will
he
said
in
a
low
kind
tone
tip
looked
up
quickly
then
down
again
he
wanted
to
ask
how
what
he
should
do
but
his
voice
choked
he
could
not
speak
a
word
and
with
the
earnest
sentence
god
bless
you
my
little
friend
and
lead
you
to
himself
holbrook
turned
and
left
him
tip
wandered
away
into
the
woods
for
a
little
when
he
returned
the
earth
was
heaped
up
fresh
and
black
over
the
new
mound
and
johnny
was
left
underneath
it
all
alone
tip
walked
around
it
slowly
trying
to
take
in
the
thought
that
the
baby
was
lying
there
that
they
should
never
see
him
again
trying
a
moment
after
to
take
in
the
thought
that
he
was
not
there
at
all
but
had
gone
up
to
the
beautiful
world
which
the
hymn
told
about
then
he
thought
of
the
chorus
and
almost
felt
i
long
i
long
i
long
to
be
there
tip
had
heard
people
pray
he
had
been
to
sabbath
school
often
enough
to
catch
and
remember
most
of
the
words
of
the
lord
prayer
he
knew
enough
of
god
to
understand
that
he
could
hear
prayer
and
that
his
help
must
be
asked
if
one
wanted
to
get
to
heaven
he
hesitated
a
moment
glanced
half
fearfully
around
him
no
one
was
there
no
one
but
himself
and
johnny
lying
low
at
his
feet
and
god
looking
down
upon
him
presently
he
knelt
down
before
the
little
grave
and
began
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
thy
kingdom
come
then
he
stopped
tip
was
in
earnest
now
he
did
not
understand
that
prayer
he
felt
as
though
he
was
not
saying
what
he
meant
he
commenced
again
oh
jesus
i
want
then
he
waited
a
minute
what
did
he
want
i
want
to
be
different
i
a
wicked
boy
i
want
to
go
where
johnny
is
when
i
die
do
show
me
how
did
jesus
ever
fail
to
hear
such
a
prayer
as
that
simple
earnest
every
word
of
it
and
he
never
will
tip
rose
up
from
that
spot
feeling
that
something
was
different
ay
and
always
would
be
different
the
saviour
had
reached
down
and
taken
hold
of
the
young
seeker
hand
and
would
for
ever
after
lead
him
up
toward
god
chapter
thy
word
is
a
lamp
to
my
feet
the
sabbath
morning
sun
awoke
tip
from
a
heavy
sleep
he
lay
still
a
few
moments
thinking
who
he
was
things
were
different
he
was
not
simply
tip
lewis
a
ragged
little
street
boy
any
longer
this
was
the
morning
when
he
was
going
to
start
out
under
a
new
motto
with
jesus
for
his
guide
he
was
going
to
sabbath
school
he
had
not
been
since
the
morning
that
miss
perry
had
taught
the
class
and
told
the
story
which
was
to
be
a
blessing
to
him
through
all
his
future
life
his
evil
spirit
had
been
strong
upon
him
during
the
three
sabbath
mornings
that
had
passed
since
then
and
persuaded
him
to
stay
away
from
the
school
but
this
morning
he
was
resolved
to
go
he
had
a
secret
hope
that
he
should
see
miss
perry
again
for
he
did
not
know
that
she
was
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
that
village
and
would
probably
never
be
there
again
all
he
knew
was
that
a
gentleman
had
brought
her
to
the
door
and
introduced
her
to
the
superintendent
as
miss
perry
that
much
he
heard
as
he
sat
gazing
at
them
this
morning
he
judged
by
the
sun
that
it
was
pretty
late
yet
he
get
on
very
fast
with
the
business
of
dressing
he
sat
down
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
looked
sorrowfully
at
his
jacket
he
even
turned
it
inside
out
to
see
if
it
would
improve
its
appearance
but
he
shook
his
head
and
speedily
turned
it
back
again
if
he
only
had
a
collar
he
said
to
himself
a
smooth
white
collar
to
turn
down
over
the
edges
it
would
make
things
look
much
better
but
that
was
something
he
had
never
had
in
his
life
and
he
put
on
the
old
ragged
brown
jacket
with
a
sigh
then
he
put
on
his
shoes
and
took
them
off
again
the
question
was
which
looked
the
best
shoes
which
showed
every
one
of
his
toes
peeping
out
on
the
top
or
no
shoes
at
all
suddenly
a
bright
idea
struck
him
if
his
feet
were
only
white
and
clean
he
thought
they
would
certainly
look
much
better
down
he
went
to
the
rickety
pump
in
the
back
yard
and
face
hands
and
feet
took
such
a
washing
as
they
had
never
received
before
then
the
old
comb
had
to
do
duty
tip
had
never
had
such
a
time
getting
dressed
but
some
way
he
felt
a
great
longing
this
morning
to
make
himself
look
neatly
he
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
ever
so
much
more
respectable
to
be
neat
and
clean
than
it
was
to
go
looking
as
he
had
always
done
still
to
carry
a
face
and
hands
and
smooth
hair
was
the
very
best
he
could
do
and
if
he
had
but
known
it
these
things
made
a
great
improvement
he
made
his
way
half
shyly
into
the
mission
seat
for
the
truth
was
he
did
not
know
just
how
the
boys
would
receive
his
attempt
at
respectability
but
he
had
no
trouble
for
several
of
his
companions
had
seen
his
face
when
he
took
his
last
look
into
that
little
coffin
the
day
before
and
they
felt
sorry
for
him
no
miss
perry
appeared
and
it
seemed
at
first
that
the
mission
boys
were
to
have
no
teacher
it
was
a
warm
morning
and
the
visitors
seat
was
vacant
but
there
was
at
last
a
great
nudging
of
elbows
and
whispers
of
look
out
now
we
in
a
scrape
no
chance
for
fun
today
and
only
eyes
looked
glad
when
holbrook
halted
before
their
class
with
good
morning
boys
then
good
morning
edward
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
and
the
minister
actually
held
out
his
hand
to
tip
holbrook
never
called
him
tip
he
had
asked
him
one
morning
what
his
real
name
was
and
since
then
had
spoken
it
edward
in
clear
plain
tones
it
was
a
restless
wearying
class
it
required
all
holbrook
wits
and
wisdom
to
keep
them
in
any
sort
of
order
to
gain
any
part
of
their
attention
yet
it
was
not
as
bad
as
usual
partly
because
the
minister
knew
how
if
anybody
did
to
teach
just
such
boys
and
partly
because
tip
hitherto
the
spirit
of
all
the
mischief
there
never
took
his
eyes
from
the
teacher
face
holbrook
watched
his
close
attention
and
took
courage
when
the
other
scholars
passed
out
he
laid
his
hand
on
tip
arm
with
the
words
you
have
been
a
good
listener
edward
did
you
understand
the
story
i
told
of
the
boy
who
started
on
a
journey
to
the
holy
land
some
of
it
i
did
you
meant
that
he
started
for
heaven
you
understand
it
i
see
do
you
want
to
take
that
journey
i
mean
to
sir
thou
mine
unbelief
was
holbrook
prayer
just
then
he
had
hoped
for
longed
for
prayed
for
these
boys
especially
for
this
one
since
the
day
before
yet
he
was
astonished
when
he
received
the
firm
prompt
answer
i
mean
to
sir
astonished
as
too
many
are
that
his
prayer
was
heard
have
you
started
my
boy
he
asked
speaking
with
a
little
tremble
in
his
voice
yes
sir
i
tried
i
told
god
last
night
that
i
would
but
i
much
know
how
you
want
a
lamp
do
you
a
what
sir
a
lamp
you
remember
in
the
story
the
boy
found
dark
places
every
little
way
then
he
took
out
his
lamp
so
he
could
lose
the
road
do
you
need
it
i
want
some
help
but
i
do
know
as
a
lamp
would
do
me
any
good
ah
yes
the
one
i
mean
will
surely
help
you
if
you
give
it
a
chance
holbrook
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
book
and
held
it
up
do
you
know
what
book
this
is
he
asked
it
a
bible
ai
it
yes
have
you
ever
read
in
the
bible
some
at
school
you
know
then
that
god
told
men
just
what
to
say
and
they
wrote
it
here
so
you
see
that
makes
it
god
words
that
is
what
we
call
it
sometimes
the
word
of
god
now
let
me
show
you
something
he
turned
the
leaves
rapidly
then
pointed
with
his
finger
to
a
verse
and
tip
read
thy
word
is
a
lamp
to
my
feet
oh
he
said
with
a
bright
look
that
is
the
kind
of
lamp
you
mean
that
is
it
and
my
boy
i
want
you
to
take
this
for
your
lamp
there
is
no
place
on
the
whole
road
so
dark
but
that
it
can
light
you
through
if
you
try
it
when
you
do
understand
it
there
is
always
jesus
to
go
to
you
know
and
taking
out
his
pencil
holbrook
wrote
on
the
in
plain
round
letters
edward
lewis
then
handing
the
book
to
him
with
a
bow
and
smile
the
minister
turned
away
tip
walked
out
of
the
school
and
down
the
road
holding
his
treasure
closely
such
a
queer
new
feeling
possessed
him
things
were
really
to
be
different
then
the
minister
had
talked
with
him
had
shaken
hands
with
him
and
given
him
a
bible
and
here
he
was
walking
quietly
away
from
the
school
all
alone
instead
of
leading
a
troop
of
noisy
boys
intent
on
mischief
oh
tip
lewis
he
said
to
himself
as
he
hugged
his
book
i
do
know
but
you
will
be
somebody
after
all
you
mean
to
try
with
all
your
might
do
you
and
you
got
a
lamp
now
chapter
vi
i
will
instruct
thee
and
teach
thee
in
the
way
which
thou
shalt
go
i
will
guide
thee
with
mine
eye
why
said
tip
as
he
sat
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
bible
why
that
is
the
very
thing
i
want
will
instruct
thee
and
teach
thee
in
the
way
which
thou
shalt
go
yes
that
exactly
it
i
want
to
begin
and
do
every
single
thing
so
different
from
what
i
ever
did
before
that
nobody
will
know
me
now
if
he
help
me
i
can
do
it
i
learn
that
verse
the
verse
was
repeated
many
times
over
for
tip
was
not
used
to
study
while
he
was
busy
thus
the
spirit
of
god
put
another
thought
into
his
heart
i
must
ask
christ
to
help
me
now
he
said
with
reverent
face
and
kneeling
down
he
made
known
his
wants
in
very
simple
words
and
in
that
plain
direct
way
which
god
loves
then
he
went
down
stairs
prepared
for
whatever
should
befall
him
that
day
kitty
was
up
and
rattling
the
kitchen
stove
kitty
what
to
pay
tip
asked
as
he
appeared
in
the
door
what
to
pay
with
you
how
did
you
happen
to
get
up
receiving
no
answer
to
this
she
continued
the
old
cat
is
to
pay
everywhere
and
always
is
these
nasty
shavings
are
soaked
through
and
through
and
the
wood
is
rotten
and
there
is
any
wood
anyway
and
i
ca
make
this
fire
burn
to
save
my
life
mother
is
sick
in
bed
ca
sit
up
at
all
she
told
me
to
make
a
cup
of
tea
for
father
and
things
look
as
if
it
would
get
made
some
time
next
month
kitty
was
only
twelve
years
old
but
like
most
of
those
children
who
have
been
left
to
bring
themselves
up
and
pick
up
wisdom
and
wickedness
wherever
they
are
to
be
found
she
was
wonderfully
old
in
mind
and
was
so
used
to
grumbling
and
snarling
that
she
could
do
it
very
rapidly
oh
said
tip
to
himself
drawing
a
long
breath
what
a
place
for
me
to
commence
in
then
he
came
bravely
to
kitty
aid
see
here
kitty
do
make
such
a
rattling
you
wake
father
i
can
make
this
fire
in
a
hurry
i
have
made
one
out
of
next
to
nothing
lots
of
times
you
just
put
some
water
in
the
and
we
have
a
cup
of
tea
in
a
jiff
kitty
stood
still
in
her
astonishment
and
watched
him
while
he
took
out
the
round
green
sticks
that
she
had
put
in
laid
in
bits
of
dry
paper
and
bits
of
sticks
laid
them
in
such
a
careless
uneven
way
that
it
seemed
to
her
they
would
never
burn
in
the
world
only
he
speedily
proved
that
they
would
by
setting
fire
to
the
whole
and
they
crackled
and
snapped
in
a
most
determined
manner
and
finally
roared
outright
certainly
kitty
had
never
been
so
much
astonished
in
her
life
first
because
that
rubbish
in
the
stove
had
been
made
to
become
such
a
positive
fire
secondly
that
tip
had
actually
set
to
work
without
being
coaxed
or
scolded
and
made
a
fire
there
was
a
queer
new
feeling
about
it
all
to
tip
himself
for
strange
as
it
may
seem
so
entirely
selfish
had
been
this
boy
life
that
this
was
actually
the
first
time
he
had
ever
of
his
own
free
will
done
anything
to
help
the
family
at
home
his
spirits
rose
with
the
effort
come
kitty
he
said
briskly
here
your
fire
now
let
fly
round
and
get
father
and
mother
some
breakfast
say
do
you
know
how
to
make
toast
it
likely
i
do
kitty
answered
shortly
if
you
had
roasted
your
face
and
burnt
your
fingers
as
often
as
i
have
making
it
for
father
i
guess
you
would
know
how
well
now
just
suppose
we
make
two
slices
one
for
mother
and
one
for
father
and
two
cups
of
tea
my
you
and
i
will
be
jolly
housekeepers
kitty
humph
said
kitty
contemptuously
you
see
she
was
in
the
least
used
to
being
and
it
took
a
great
deal
of
coaxing
to
make
her
give
other
than
short
sharp
answers
to
all
that
was
said
but
for
all
that
she
went
to
work
after
tip
had
poured
some
water
in
the
dingy
little
and
set
it
over
the
fire
cutting
the
two
slices
of
bread
and
getting
them
ready
to
toast
when
there
should
be
any
coals
tip
meantime
hunted
among
the
confusion
of
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
cupboard
for
two
clean
plates
and
cups
you
taken
with
an
awful
clean
fit
seems
to
me
kitty
said
as
she
stood
watching
him
while
he
hunted
for
a
cloth
then
carefully
wiped
off
the
plates
yes
answered
tip
i
going
to
try
it
for
a
spell
and
find
out
how
things
look
after
they
are
washed
altogether
it
was
a
queer
morning
to
both
of
them
and
each
felt
a
touch
of
triumph
when
at
last
the
toast
lay
brown
and
nice
a
slice
on
each
plate
and
the
hot
tea
poured
into
the
cups
smelled
fresh
and
fragrant
the
two
children
went
softly
to
the
bedroom
door
in
time
to
hear
their
father
say
what
makes
you
try
to
get
up
if
your
head
is
so
bad
oh
what
makes
me
what
else
is
there
for
to
do
the
young
ones
are
both
up
and
if
i
find
the
roof
left
on
the
house
i
be
thankful
i
never
knew
them
to
stay
together
five
minutes
without
having
a
battle
at
almost
any
other
time
in
her
life
these
words
would
have
made
kitty
very
angry
but
this
morning
she
was
intent
on
not
letting
her
tea
spill
over
on
the
toast
and
so
paid
very
little
attention
to
them
tip
marched
boldly
in
with
his
dish
kitty
following
lie
still
mother
till
you
get
some
of
our
tea
and
toast
and
i
reckon
it
will
cure
you
lewis
raised
herself
on
one
elbow
saw
the
beautiful
brown
slices
caught
a
whiff
of
the
fragrant
tea
then
asked
wonderingly
who
here
kitty
and
me
tip
made
answer
proudly
and
promptly
something
very
like
a
smile
gathered
on
lewis
worn
fretful
face
well
now
she
said
if
i
ai
beat
it
the
last
thing
on
earth
i
ever
expected
you
to
do
what
spell
had
come
over
tip
breakfast
was
a
great
success
after
it
was
over
he
found
a
great
many
things
to
do
the
rusty
old
axe
was
hunted
up
and
some
hard
knots
made
to
become
very
sticks
of
wood
which
he
piled
in
the
kitty
under
the
influence
of
his
strange
behaviour
washed
the
dishes
and
even
got
out
the
broom
and
swept
a
little
altogether
that
was
a
day
long
to
be
remembered
by
tip
a
day
in
which
he
began
his
life
afresh
he
made
some
mistakes
for
he
fancied
in
his
ignorance
that
the
struggle
was
over
that
he
had
only
to
go
forward
joyfully
over
a
pleasant
road
he
found
out
his
mistake
he
discovered
that
satan
had
not
by
any
means
given
him
up
that
he
must
yet
fight
many
hard
hard
battles

thee
they
must
have
had
an
earthquake
down
at
lewis
this
morning
howard
minturn
said
to
the
boys
who
were
gathered
around
the
schoolroom
door
the
first
bell
has
not
rung
yet
and
there
comes
tip
up
the
hill
up
the
hill
came
tip
sure
enough
with
a
firm
resolute
step
the
summer
vacation
was
over
the
fall
term
was
to
commence
this
morning
and
among
the
things
which
tip
had
resolved
to
do
was
this
one
to
come
steadily
and
promptly
to
school
during
the
term
which
was
something
that
he
had
never
done
in
his
life
the
public
school
was
the
best
one
in
the
village
so
he
had
the
best
boys
in
town
for
school
companions
as
well
as
some
of
the
worst
hallo
tip
said
bob
turner
coming
partly
down
the
hill
to
meet
him
how
are
you
old
fellow
bob
had
been
away
during
most
of
the
vacation
and
knew
nothing
of
the
changes
which
there
had
been
in
his
absence
tip
winced
a
little
at
his
greeting
shivered
a
little
at
the
thought
of
the
temptation
which
bob
would
be
to
him
the
two
had
been
linked
together
all
their
lives
in
every
form
of
mischief
and
wrong
they
seemed
almost
a
part
of
each
other
at
least
they
seemed
so
until
within
these
few
weeks
now
tip
rather
than
knew
how
far
separated
they
must
be
the
bell
rang
and
the
boys
jostled
and
tumbled
against
each
other
to
their
seats
bob
turner
as
usual
seated
himself
beside
tip
but
then
bob
only
came
to
school
about
two
forenoons
in
a
week
so
perhaps
they
might
get
along
when
the
bible
reading
commenced
tip
hesitated
and
his
face
flushed
he
had
never
owned
a
bible
to
read
from
before
but
this
morning
his
new
one
lay
in
his
pocket
the
question
was
had
he
courage
to
take
it
out
what
would
the
boys
think
what
would
they
say
how
should
he
answer
them
he
began
to
think
he
would
wait
until
tomorrow
morning
then
he
grew
hot
and
ashamed
as
he
saw
that
he
was
already
trying
to
hide
his
colours
suddenly
he
drew
out
his
bible
and
began
very
hurriedly
to
turn
the
leaves
bob
heard
the
rustling
and
glancing
around
puckered
his
lips
as
if
he
were
going
to
whistle
and
snatching
the
book
read
the
name
which
holbrook
had
written
therein
then
he
whispered
you
do
say
so
when
did
we
steal
a
bible
and
turn
saint
the
blood
growing
hotter
and
redder
in
tip
cheeks
was
his
only
answer
but
he
felt
that
his
temptation
had
begun
the
next
thing
was
to
read
when
he
had
finally
found
the
place
even
though
there
were
more
than
fifty
voices
reading
those
same
words
yet
poor
tip
imagined
that
his
would
be
louder
than
all
the
rest
and
he
choked
and
coughed
and
made
more
than
one
trial
before
he
forced
his
voice
to
join
even
in
a
whisper
at
the
words
and
they
clothed
him
with
purple
and
plaited
a
crown
of
thorns
and
put
it
about
his
head
it
did
not
help
him
in
his
reading
that
bob
made
his
lips
move
with
the
rest
but
said
loud
enough
for
him
to
hear
the
man
in
the
moon
came
down
too
soon
and
continued
to
repeat
some
senseless
or
wicked
rhymes
through
the
reading
of
the
beautiful
chapter
how
thankfully
tip
bowed
his
head
that
morning
his
heart
had
taken
in
some
of
the
sweet
words
that
sacred
head
had
been
crowned
with
thorns
indeed
but
he
knew
it
was
crowned
with
glory
now
and
he
knew
that
christ
had
suffered
and
died
for
him
he
joined
with
his
whole
heart
in
burrows
prayer
and
though
bob
pulled
his
hair
and
tickled
his
foot
and
stepped
on
his
toes
the
bowed
head
was
not
lifted
and
his
spirit
gathered
strength
but
tip
never
forgot
the
trials
of
that
day
nor
the
hard
work
which
he
had
to
endure
them
bob
was
as
usual
overflowing
with
mischief
and
failing
in
finding
the
willing
helper
which
he
had
expected
in
his
old
companion
took
revenge
in
aiming
a
great
many
of
his
pranks
at
him
such
senseless
silly
things
as
he
did
to
annoy
tip
spread
his
slate
over
with
a
long
row
of
figures
which
he
earnestly
tried
to
add
and
having
toiled
slowly
up
the
first
two
columns
bob
wet
finger
was
slyly
drawn
across
it
and
no
trace
of
the
answer
so
hardly
earned
appeared
then
too
he
had
his
own
heart
to
struggle
against
he
was
so
used
to
whispering
to
this
and
that
boy
seated
near
him
to
eating
apples
when
the
teacher
back
was
turned
to
making
an
picture
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
pinning
it
on
the
back
of
a
small
boy
before
him
he
was
so
unused
to
sitting
still
and
trying
to
study
what
hard
work
it
was
to
study
any
way
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
never
get
that
in
the
world
the
harder
he
tried
the
more
bewildered
he
grew
a
dozen
times
he
spelled
the
two
words
receive
and
believe
standing
so
closely
together
each
time
sure
he
was
right
and
each
time
discovering
that
the
i
and
e
must
change
places
he
grew
utterly
provoked
and
disheartened
and
would
have
fairly
cried
had
not
bob
been
beside
him
to
see
the
tears
and
grow
merry
over
them
finally
he
lost
all
patience
with
bob
and
turning
fiercely
to
him
after
he
had
for
the
third
time
pitched
the
greasy
old
upside
down
on
the
floor
said
look
here
now
if
you
come
that
thing
again
i
pitch
you
out
of
the
window
quicker
than
wink
edward
lewis
marked
for
whispering
said
burrows
edward
you
have
commenced
the
term
as
usual
i
see
the
first
one
marked
for
bad
conduct
how
tip
ears
burned
how
untrue
it
was
he
had
not
commenced
this
term
as
usual
how
differently
he
had
tried
to
commence
it
only
he
and
god
knew
and
now
to
fail
thus
early
in
the
day
his
head
seemed
to
spin
and
his
brain
reel
he
bowed
himself
on
the
seat
again
but
bob
head
went
down
promptly
and
he
whispered
little
bo
peep
has
lost
her
sheep
how
often
tip
had
thought
such
things
as
these
so
very
funny
that
he
could
not
possibly
help
laughing
how
silly
and
meaningless
yes
and
cruel
did
they
seem
to
him
now
oh
satan
was
struggling
for
tip
he
was
reaping
the
fruits
of
long
weeks
spent
in
evil
company
and
folly
he
looked
over
to
the
back
seats
where
sat
howard
minturn
and
ellis
holbrook
hard
at
work
on
their
algebra
lesson
nobody
thinking
of
such
a
thing
as
disturbing
them
and
as
he
looked
sighed
heavily
if
he
had
only
gained
such
a
place
as
they
had
in
the
school
how
easily
he
could
work
they
were
very
little
older
than
he
yet
here
he
was
trying
to
do
an
example
in
addition
doing
it
over
four
times
before
it
was
right
and
they
were
at
the
head
of
the
class
in
algebra
if
he
could
only
jump
to
where
they
were
and
go
on
with
them
and
the
hopelessness
of
this
thought
made
his
seem
harder
so
it
was
no
wonder
when
the
class
formed
and
he
took
his
old
place
at
the
foot
and
he
stayed
there
and
spelled
believe
after
all
nobody
was
surprised
but
nobody
knew
how
very
hard
he
had
tried
the
long
day
crowded
full
of
trouble
and
temptation
to
poor
tip
wore
away
at
recess
he
wandered
off
by
himself
trying
hard
to
get
back
some
of
the
strong
firm
hopes
of
the
morning
one
more
sharp
trial
was
in
store
for
him
towards
the
close
of
the
afternoon
bob
fun
took
the
form
of
paper
balls
which
at
every
turn
of
burrows
back
spun
through
the
room
in
all
directions
two
or
three
of
the
smaller
scholars
joined
him
and
a
regular
fire
of
balls
was
kept
up
the
boys
complained
burrows
scolded
at
last
he
spoke
this
short
prompt
sentence
the
next
boy
i
catch
throwing
paper
or
anything
else
in
this
room
i
shall
punish
severely
and
i
shall
expect
any
scholar
who
sees
anything
of
this
kind
going
on
to
inform
me
not
five
minutes
after
that
burrows
bent
over
his
desk
in
search
of
something
within
when
whisk
went
the
largest
paper
ball
that
had
been
thrown
that
day
and
landed
on
the
teacher
forehead
some
of
the
scholars
laughed
some
looked
grave
and
startled
for
burrows
was
a
man
who
always
meant
what
he
said
does
any
one
know
who
threw
that
ball
he
asked
closing
his
desk
and
speaking
in
a
calm
steady
tone
no
reply
silence
for
a
minute
then
ellis
holbrook
do
you
know
who
threw
that
ball
of
paper
yes
sir
very
well
i
am
waiting
to
be
told
tip
lewis
threw
it
sir
this
was
a
little
too
much
for
tip
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
ever
been
in
school
all
day
without
throwing
one
to
be
so
accused
he
sprang
up
in
his
seat
with
fire
in
his
eyes
i
did
he
almost
screamed
he
knows
i
did
it
is
a
mean
wicked
lie
sit
down
said
burrows
ellis
did
you
him
throw
it
yes
sir
i
did
burrows
turned
to
tip
edward
come
here
tip
was
still
standing
say
you
wo
whispered
bob
say
you
wo
stir
a
step
for
the
old
fellow
if
he
goes
to
make
you
we
see
who
beat
but
the
command
was
repeated
and
tip
went
forward
fixing
his
steady
eyes
on
burrows
as
he
spoke
burrows
as
sure
as
i
live
i
not
throw
that
paper
ball
and
yet
poor
tip
he
knew
he
would
not
be
believed
he
knew
his
word
could
not
be
trusted
he
knew
he
had
often
stood
there
and
as
boldly
declared
what
was
true
and
what
had
been
proved
in
a
few
minutes
to
be
false
no
nobody
believed
tip
he
had
earned
among
other
things
in
the
school
the
name
of
hardly
ever
speaking
the
truth
and
now
he
must
suffer
for
it
so
he
stood
still
and
received
the
swift
hard
blows
of
the
ruler
on
his
hands
stood
without
a
tear
or
a
promise
burrows
had
not
a
doubt
of
his
guilt
for
had
not
ellis
holbrook
whose
word
was
law
in
the
school
said
he
saw
the
mischief
done
and
did
not
tip
always
deny
all
knowledge
of
such
matters
until
made
to
own
them
still
this
time
the
boy
resolutely
refused
to
confess
that
he
had
thrown
a
bit
of
paper
that
day
and
went
back
to
his
seat
with
smarting
hands
and
the
stern
words
of
his
teacher
ringing
in
his
ears
what
a
heavy
bitter
heart
the
poor
boy
carried
out
from
the
schoolroom
that
afternoon
he
felt
as
though
he
almost
hated
every
scholar
there
hated
ellis
holbrook
burrows
catching
a
glimpse
of
his
face
said
to
one
of
the
other
teachers
that
boy
grows
sullen
with
all
the
rest
his
was
the
only
good
thing
which
he
had
about
him
and
he
is
losing
that
tip
heard
him
and
felt
that
it
was
true
he
had
been
punished
many
a
time
before
and
taken
it
with
the
most
provoking
good
humour
but
it
was
different
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
received
a
punishment
which
he
did
not
deserve
this
day
of
all
others
in
which
he
had
tried
with
all
his
heart
to
do
right
why
did
you
hold
on
you
simpleton
bob
asked
never
saw
you
get
up
so
much
pluck
in
my
life
what
made
you
back
out
and
be
whipped
like
a
baby
why
did
own
that
you
threw
that
plaguy
paper
ball
and
not
sit
there
like
a
coward
and
see
me
take
your
whipping
own
it
that
a
good
one
honour
tip
did
you
throw
that
ball
i
thought
you
did
i
was
aiming
one
at
ellis
holbrook
head
just
then
and
i
did
see
what
was
going
on
behind
me
did
you
throw
it
honour
bright
no
i
did
and
i
throw
if
you
say
so
again
and
tip
turned
suddenly
in
the
opposite
direction
but
satan
still
walked
with
him
it
no
use
said
this
evil
spirit
speaking
out
boldly
it
no
use
do
you
see
it
is
you
might
as
well
give
it
up
first
as
last
the
boys
and
the
teacher
and
every
one
think
you
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
wicked
young
scamp
and
you
never
be
anything
else
been
humbugging
yourself
these
four
weeks
making
believe
you
had
a
great
friend
to
help
you
why
has
he
helped
you
you
tried
your
best
all
day
long
and
he
knows
you
have
yet
you
never
had
such
a
hard
day
in
your
life
if
he
cares
anything
at
all
about
you
why
did
he
help
you
you
asked
him
to
tip
sat
down
on
a
log
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
gave
himself
up
for
a
little
to
satan
guidance
and
the
wicked
voice
went
on
now
you
see
you
been
cheated
you
tried
hard
for
a
whole
month
to
somebody
and
no
one
thinks
any
more
of
you
than
they
did
before
and
never
will
your
mother
scolds
just
as
much
and
your
home
looks
just
as
dismal
and
kitty
is
just
as
hateful
and
the
respectable
boys
in
the
village
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
you
might
just
as
well
lounge
around
and
have
a
good
time
nobody
expects
you
to
be
good
or
will
let
you
when
you
want
to
be
softly
there
came
another
voice
knocking
at
tip
heart
at
first
he
would
not
notice
it
but
it
be
heard
what
of
all
that
it
said
suppose
nobody
cares
for
you
or
helps
you
here
jesus
died
you
know
and
he
is
your
friend
you
that
is
not
a
humbug
you
he
has
heard
you
when
you
knelt
down
and
prayed
he
has
helped
you
then
there
heaven
where
all
the
beauty
is
and
he
has
promised
to
take
you
yes
there
by
and
by
oh
you
must
not
complain
because
people
wo
believe
that
such
a
bad
boy
as
you
have
been
has
grown
good
so
soon
christ
knows
about
it
so
it
all
right
just
keep
on
trying
and
one
of
these
days
folks
will
see
that
you
mean
it
they
god
has
promised
he
has
given
you
a
lamp
to
light
you
why
have
not
you
looked
at
it
all
this
day
oh
said
tip
i
ca
i
be
a
christian
i
have
not
done
right
nor
felt
right
i
almost
hate
the
boys
and
burrows
too
i
do
know
what
to
do
go
on
home
said
satan
let
the
lamp
and
these
new
notions
and
all
christ
do
care
anything
about
such
a
miserable
wicked
boy
as
you
have
been
do
you
expect
him
to
notice
but
tip
hand
was
in
his
pocket
resting
on
his
lamp
as
he
had
learned
to
call
it
and
the
low
sweet
voice
in
his
heart
was
urging
him
to
let
its
light
shine
he
drew
it
out
and
turned
the
leaves
and
the
same
dear
helper
stopped
his
eyes
at
the
words
fear
not
for
i
have
redeemed
thee
i
have
called
thee
by
thy
name
thou
art
then
came
hot
thankful
tears
oh
precious
words
sinking
right
into
the
torn
troubled
heart
christ
the
redeemer
had
called
him
by
his
name
he
was
yes
he
be
he
glanced
around
nobody
was
to
be
seen
he
was
sitting
in
the
hollow
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
under
the
shade
of
a
low
branching
tree
and
there
he
knelt
down
to
pray
and
satan
drew
himself
away
for
the
spot
around
that
kneeling
boy
was
holy
ground
tip
soul
had
gained
the
victory
chapter
viii
freely
ye
have
received
freely
give
whether
tip
felt
it
or
not
there
were
some
changes
in
his
home
lewis
though
worried
and
hurried
and
cross
enough
still
was
not
so
much
so
as
she
had
been
the
house
was
quieter
there
was
no
cradle
to
rock
there
were
no
baby
footsteps
to
follow
and
keep
out
of
danger
she
had
more
time
for
sewing
yet
this
very
thing
the
missing
of
the
clinging
arms
about
her
neck
sometimes
made
her
heavy
heart
vent
itself
in
short
sharp
words
but
tip
had
astonished
the
family
at
home
it
did
require
wonderful
changes
to
do
it
rather
the
change
which
they
saw
in
him
seemed
wonderful
the
fire
which
she
found
ready
made
in
the
morning
the
full
pail
of
fresh
water
the
box
filled
with
wood
were
all
so
many
drops
of
honey
to
the
tired
mother
heart
the
awkward
pat
of
his
father
pillow
which
tip
now
and
then
gave
as
he
lingered
to
ask
how
he
was
seemed
so
new
and
delightful
to
that
neglected
father
heart
that
he
lay
on
his
hard
bed
and
thought
of
it
much
all
day
tip
got
on
better
at
home
than
anywhere
else
he
had
not
so
many
temptations
he
had
been
such
a
lawless
reckless
boy
that
they
had
all
learned
to
leave
him
very
much
to
himself
and
as
not
a
great
deal
of
his
time
was
spent
there
his
trials
at
home
were
not
many
as
for
kitty
she
did
not
cease
to
wonder
what
had
happened
to
tip
she
perhaps
felt
the
difference
more
than
any
one
else
for
it
had
been
the
delight
of
his
life
to
tease
her
now
from
the
time
that
he
gathered
his
books
with
the
first
sound
of
the
and
hurried
up
the
hill
until
he
returned
at
night
ready
to
split
wood
hoe
in
the
garden
or
do
any
of
the
dozen
things
that
he
had
never
been
known
to
do
before
he
was
a
subject
of
thought
and
wonderment
to
her
watching
him
closely
the
only
thing
she
could
finally
settle
on
as
the
cause
of
the
change
which
she
found
in
him
was
that
he
now
went
every
sabbath
morning
to
the
sabbath
school
the
mystery
must
be
hidden
there
having
decided
that
matter
kitty
speedily
resolved
that
she
would
go
there
herself
and
see
what
they
did
many
were
the
kind
hearts
that
had
tried
to
coax
her
into
that
same
sabbath
school
and
had
failed
but
this
saturday
afternoon
gazing
out
of
the
window
with
a
wonderfully
sober
face
had
ended
in
her
exclaiming
i
say
mother
i
want
a
needle
and
thread
what
do
you
want
with
a
needle
and
thread
asked
lewis
stirring
away
at
some
gruel
in
a
tin
basin
and
not
even
glancing
up
i
want
to
mend
my
dress
it
torn
this
way
and
that
and
looks
awful
i
want
some
green
thread
the
colour
of
this
wide
stripe
now
for
a
minute
the
gruel
was
forgotten
and
lewis
looked
at
kitty
in
amazement
dear
me
she
said
at
last
i
do
know
what
will
happen
next
it
ca
be
possible
that
you
are
going
to
work
to
mend
your
own
dress
without
being
scolded
about
it
for
a
week
and
then
made
to
do
it
yes
i
am
too
i
ai
going
to
look
like
a
another
hour
and
i
going
to
wash
out
my
and
iron
it
then
i
mean
to
go
over
to
that
sunday
school
i
ai
heard
any
singing
since
i
was
born
as
i
know
of
and
i
mean
to
the
gruel
began
to
burn
and
lewis
turned
to
it
again
saying
nothing
but
thinking
a
great
deal
once
she
used
to
go
to
sabbath
school
herself
when
she
was
kitty
age
and
she
did
have
to
mend
her
dress
first
either
she
used
to
be
dressed
freshly
and
neatly
every
sabbath
morning
by
her
mother
own
careful
hands
she
poured
the
gruel
into
a
bowl
and
then
went
over
to
her
workbox
here
a
needle
and
thread
she
said
at
last
drawing
out
a
snarl
of
green
thread
from
the
many
snarls
in
her
box
mend
your
dress
if
you
want
to
and
i
wash
out
your
bonnet
for
you
towards
night
when
i
get
that
vest
done
it
was
kitty
turn
to
be
astonished
now
she
had
not
expected
help
from
her
mother
tip
lingered
in
the
kitchen
on
sabbath
morning
he
looked
neat
and
clean
he
had
a
fresh
clean
shirt
thanks
to
the
washing
which
his
mother
had
done
towards
night
he
was
all
ready
for
school
yet
he
waited
kitty
clattered
around
making
rather
more
noise
even
than
usual
as
she
washed
up
the
few
poor
dishes
evidently
tip
was
thinking
about
her
the
truth
was
his
lamp
had
shown
him
a
lesson
that
morning
like
this
freely
ye
have
received
freely
give
he
stopped
at
that
verse
reading
no
further
what
did
it
mean
i
surely
it
spoke
to
him
had
not
god
given
oh
many
things
to
him
had
he
not
promised
to
give
him
heaven
for
his
home
now
here
was
the
direction
freely
give
what
and
to
whom
to
god
surely
not
tip
was
certain
that
he
had
nothing
to
give
to
god
nothing
but
his
poor
sinful
heart
which
he
believed
the
saviour
had
taken
and
made
clean
what
could
he
give
to
any
one
he
leaned
out
of
his
little
window
busy
with
this
thought
kitty
came
out
to
the
door
and
pumped
her
pan
full
of
water
he
looked
down
on
her
there
was
kitty
had
he
anything
which
he
could
give
her
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
not
a
thing
but
it
be
the
same
if
he
could
help
her
to
get
something
what
if
he
could
coax
her
to
go
to
sunday
school
perhaps
it
would
do
for
her
all
that
it
had
done
for
him
and
at
this
moment
the
unwearied
satan
came
with
his
wicked
thoughts
kitty
would
be
a
object
to
go
to
sabbath
school
not
a
decent
thing
to
wear
everybody
would
laugh
at
her
and
at
you
besides
i
do
believe
she
would
go
if
you
ask
her
she
would
only
make
fun
of
you
better
not
try
it
oh
tip
lewis
said
his
conscience
what
a
miserable
coward
you
are
after
all
you
have
promised
you
wo
risk
a
laugh
for
the
sake
of
getting
kitty
into
the
sabbath
school
yes
i
will
said
tip
and
he
ran
downstairs
and
this
was
why
he
lingered
in
the
kitchen
not
knowing
just
what
to
say
kitty
helped
him
tip
said
she
i
suppose
they
sing
over
at
that
sunday
school
do
they
i
guess
they
do
and
tip
eyes
brightened
ever
so
many
of
them
sing
at
once
and
it
sounds
grand
i
tell
you
they
play
the
melodeon
too
do
you
want
to
go
and
hear
it
humph
i
do
know
i
do
suppose
it
will
be
any
stupider
than
staying
at
home
i
get
awful
sick
of
that
if
i
knew
the
way
maybe
i
would
go
oh
i
take
you
said
tip
in
a
quick
eager
way
he
wanted
to
speak
before
his
courage
failed
so
kitty
in
her
stiff
blue
sunbonnet
and
green
calico
dress
went
to
sabbath
school
there
was
no
mission
class
for
girls
so
parker
sent
her
among
the
little
girls
in
miss
haley
class
but
holbrook
detained
tip
edward
you
intend
to
come
to
sabbath
school
regularly
do
you
yes
sir
then
i
think
we
must
leave
your
place
in
the
mission
seat
to
be
filled
by
some
other
boy
and
you
may
come
forward
to
my
class
it
is
doubtful
whether
tip
will
ever
see
a
prouder
or
happier
moment
than
that
one
in
which
he
followed
the
minister
down
the
long
room
to
his
class
but
when
he
saw
the
seat
full
of
boys
his
face
grew
crimson
at
the
end
of
the
seat
was
ellis
holbrook
the
son
the
boy
who
but
a
few
days
before
had
he
believed
in
his
heart
told
a
wicked
story
about
himself
and
gained
him
a
severe
punishment
he
did
not
feel
as
though
he
could
sit
beside
that
boy
even
in
sabbath
school
but
holbrook
waited
and
sit
down
he
ellis
moved
along
to
give
him
room
and
disturbed
him
neither
by
word
nor
look
during
the
lesson
but
tip
heart
was
full
of
bitterness
and
he
thought
the
pleasure
of
that
morning
gone
the
lesson
was
of
christ
and
his
death
on
the
cross
and
as
he
listened
hard
thoughts
began
to
die
out
the
story
was
too
new
it
touched
too
near
his
heart
not
to
calm
the
angry
feelings
and
to
interest
him
wonderfully
as
soon
as
school
was
dismissed
holbrook
turned
to
him
what
disturbs
you
edward
tip
face
grew
red
again
i
i
nothing
much
sir
have
you
and
ellis
been
having
trouble
in
school
he
has
been
getting
into
trouble
spoke
tip
boldly
finding
himself
caught
holbrook
sat
down
again
can
you
tell
me
about
it
edward
he
said
i
threw
paper
balls
and
burrows
whipped
me
and
i
did
are
you
sure
you
did
yes
sir
did
you
say
so
at
the
time
over
and
over
again
but
he
said
he
me
edward
have
you
always
spoken
the
truth
is
your
word
to
be
believed
tip
eyes
fell
and
his
lip
quivered
i
told
a
great
many
stories
he
said
at
last
in
a
low
humble
tone
but
this
is
one
trying
to
tell
the
truth
after
this
and
jesus
believes
what
i
have
said
this
time
so
do
i
edward
answered
holbrook
gently
even
tenderly
ellis
was
mistaken
but
i
see
you
are
angry
with
him
ca
you
get
over
that
tip
shook
his
head
he
got
me
whipped
for
nothing
sir
suppose
christ
should
follow
that
rule
edward
and
forgive
only
those
who
had
treated
him
well
would
you
be
forgiven
this
was
a
new
thought
to
tip
and
made
him
silent
holbrook
held
out
his
hand
for
the
little
red
bible
let
me
show
you
what
this
lamp
of
yours
says
about
the
matter
and
tip
eyes
presently
read
where
the
minister
finger
pointed
if
ye
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses
neither
will
your
father
forgive
your
trespasses
trespasses
mean
sins
explained
holbrook
then
he
turned
away
all
this
time
kitty
had
been
standing
waiting
not
for
tip
she
expect
his
company
but
for
the
stylish
little
girls
to
get
fairly
started
on
their
way
to
church
so
she
could
go
home
without
having
any
of
them
look
at
or
make
fun
of
her
kitty
had
not
been
having
a
very
good
time
she
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
teacher
who
thought
if
she
asked
the
questions
in
the
and
if
one
scholar
could
not
answer
passed
on
to
the
next
she
had
done
her
duty
so
the
singing
was
pretty
nearly
all
kitty
had
cared
for
god
was
leaving
most
of
the
work
for
tip
to
do
after
all
he
went
over
to
her
now
and
walked
down
the
road
with
her
the
boys
had
all
gone
as
well
as
the
girls
so
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
their
walking
on
quietly
together
how
did
you
like
it
kitty
he
asked
oh
i
did
think
much
of
it
i
sat
by
the
ugliest
girl
in
town
and
she
made
fun
of
my
bonnet
and
my
shoes
i
her
tip
had
a
faint
notion
in
his
heart
that
kitty
also
needed
the
verse
which
had
just
been
given
him
but
he
had
other
thoughts
about
her
spirit
was
at
work
having
taken
her
to
sabbath
school
having
begun
a
good
work
he
wanted
it
to
go
on
it
was
very
hard
to
speak
to
kitty
he
did
know
what
to
say
but
all
the
way
down
the
hill
there
seemed
to
ring
in
his
ears
the
message
freely
ye
have
received
freely
give
kitty
he
said
at
last
do
you
want
to
be
a
christian
i
do
know
what
a
christian
is
but
would
you
like
to
love
jesus
how
do
i
know
replied
kitty
shortly
i
do
know
anything
about
jesus
oh
did
you
hear
in
the
lesson
about
how
he
loves
everybody
and
wants
everybody
to
love
him
and
how
he
died
so
we
could
i
do
know
a
thing
about
the
lesson
i
counted
the
buttons
on
miss
harley
dress
most
all
the
time
they
went
up
and
down
the
front
and
up
and
down
the
sides
and
everywhere
oh
but
kitty
you
surely
heard
the
hymn
loves
me
this
i
know
for
the
bible
tells
me
so
yes
kitty
said
the
hymn
was
pretty
enough
only
nobody
gave
me
a
book
and
i
could
just
hear
a
word
now
and
then
altogether
tip
did
feel
that
he
had
done
kitty
a
bit
of
good
but
he
knew
this
much
that
since
he
had
begun
to
think
about
and
talk
to
her
he
longed
yes
with
all
his
heart
to
have
her
come
to
christ
ellis
come
here
a
moment
said
holbrook
turning
towards
his
study
door
as
the
family
came
in
from
church
what
is
it
about
this
trouble
in
school
with
edward
lewis
no
trouble
father
only
tip
threw
a
paper
ball
just
as
he
always
doing
and
as
burrows
asked
me
if
i
knew
who
threw
it
of
course
i
had
to
tell
him
and
that
made
tip
mad
why
has
he
been
complaining
to
you
father
ellis
did
you
see
edward
throw
paper
yes
sir
are
you
positive
yes
why
that
is
i
glanced
up
from
my
book
just
in
time
to
see
it
whiz
and
it
came
from
tip
direction
and
his
hand
was
raised
so
i
supposed
of
course
he
threw
it
i
thought
a
minute
ago
that
i
knew
he
did
but
now
you
would
not
say
positively
that
some
boy
near
him
might
not
have
done
it
why
no
sir
alex
palmer
might
have
thrown
it
but
i
did
think
of
such
a
thing
well
ellis
my
verdict
is
that
you
were
mistaken
i
do
think
edward
told
a
falsehood
this
time
i
tell
you
why
he
is
trying
to
take
the
saviour
for
his
pattern
i
believe
he
is
a
christian
now
there
is
one
thing
which
i
want
you
to
think
of
edward
lewis
who
has
never
been
taught
anything
good
who
has
never
had
any
one
to
help
him
has
given
his
heart
to
christ
and
my
boy
for
whom
i
have
prayed
with
all
my
soul
every
day
since
he
was
born
has
not
chapter
ix
hitherto
hath
the
lord
helped
us
boys
said
burrows
one
monday
afternoon
you
may
lay
aside
your
books
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
books
were
hurriedly
gathered
and
piled
in
their
places
and
the
boys
sat
up
with
folded
arms
ready
for
whatever
their
teacher
had
to
offer
burrows
drew
out
his
from
behind
the
desk
and
sat
down
for
a
chat
who
will
tell
me
what
an
acrostic
is
several
hands
were
raised
well
howard
let
us
hear
what
you
think
about
it
it
a
piece
of
poetry
sir
where
the
first
letter
of
every
line
spells
another
word
do
you
mean
the
first
letter
alone
spells
a
word
the
boys
laughed
and
howard
explained
promptly
no
sir
i
mean
the
first
letters
of
each
line
taken
together
form
a
name
must
an
acrostic
always
be
written
in
poetry
this
question
called
forth
several
answers
and
made
a
good
deal
of
talk
but
it
was
finally
decided
that
there
could
be
acrostics
in
prose
as
well
as
in
rhyme
and
burrows
asked
how
many
understand
now
what
an
acrostic
is
a
few
more
hands
were
raised
but
many
of
the
boys
did
not
understand
yet
it
must
be
made
plainer
howard
said
burrows
come
to
the
board
and
give
us
an
acrostic
on
the
word
boy
howard
sprang
up
must
it
be
a
sensible
one
sir
sense
or
nonsense
just
as
you
please
so
as
it
shows
us
what
an
acrostic
is
i
can
take
my
and
give
you
one
i
think
sir
and
howard
came
forward
and
wrote
rapidly
b
but
you
shall
hear
an
odd
affair
indeed
o
of
which
all
europe
rings
from
side
to
side
then
he
paused
turning
the
leaves
of
his
eagerly
i
ca
find
anything
in
y
to
finish
this
up
with
he
said
at
last
ca
you
give
us
a
line
from
your
own
brain
and
at
this
howard
eye
brightened
with
fun
and
turning
to
the
board
after
a
moment
of
thought
he
dashed
off
the
closing
line
y
you
who
can
finish
this
may
have
the
job
then
took
his
seat
amid
bursts
of
laughter
from
the
boys
who
all
began
to
understand
what
an
acrostic
was
ellis
holbrook
hand
was
up
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
questions
burrows
why
is
that
called
by
such
a
queer
name
as
acrostic
his
teacher
smiled
you
must
study
greek
ellis
we
get
it
from
two
words
in
the
greek
or
from
one
word
made
up
of
two
others
which
mean
or
and
in
an
acrostic
the
beginnings
of
the
lines
are
arranged
in
order
do
you
understand
how
we
get
that
word
now
yes
sir
well
now
you
would
all
like
to
know
what
this
talk
is
for
i
want
every
boy
in
school
who
can
write
to
bring
an
acrostic
on
his
own
name
for
his
next
composition
the
boys
groaned
and
exclaimed
they
could
do
it
they
were
sure
they
could
to
do
it
yes
you
can
said
burrows
i
do
give
my
scholars
any
work
that
they
do
you
may
quote
it
or
make
it
original
as
you
please
but
i
want
every
one
of
you
to
johnny
thorpe
the
smallest
boy
in
school
who
could
write
now
seemed
in
trouble
and
stretched
up
his
arm
to
its
full
length
well
johnny
what
will
you
have
asked
his
teacher
if
you
please
sir
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
quote
burrows
laughed
pleasantly
i
must
remember
i
see
to
speak
plain
english
i
mean
you
may
borrow
your
essay
from
a
book
or
a
dozen
books
if
you
like
so
that
you
try
to
make
us
believe
the
thoughts
are
your
own
you
may
write
in
poetry
or
not
as
you
please
but
i
want
each
to
choose
a
subject
and
stick
to
it
better
than
howard
did
just
now
i
have
given
you
something
to
do
that
will
keep
you
hard
at
work
but
you
will
succeed
at
last
tip
went
home
in
a
tumult
what
could
he
do
he
had
never
written
a
composition
in
his
life
having
made
it
a
point
to
run
away
from
school
on
but
running
away
was
done
with
now
it
did
seem
possible
that
he
could
write
anything
certainly
not
in
such
a
new
queer
way
as
burrows
wished
them
to
supper
and
were
hurried
over
for
that
evening
and
tip
took
his
way
very
early
to
the
seat
under
the
down
by
the
pond
he
wanted
to
think
to
see
how
he
should
meet
this
new
trouble
it
was
a
real
trouble
to
him
for
he
had
set
out
to
do
just
right
and
he
saw
no
way
of
getting
out
of
this
duty
and
thought
he
saw
no
way
of
doing
it
there
is
no
place
on
the
road
so
dark
but
this
lamp
will
light
you
through
if
you
give
it
a
chance
this
is
what
holbrook
had
said
when
he
gave
tip
his
bible
and
tip
had
thought
of
his
words
very
often
had
already
proved
them
true
more
than
once
but
he
did
see
how
it
could
help
him
now
he
took
it
out
and
slowly
turned
the
leaves
it
could
write
his
composition
for
him
that
was
certain
but
oh
the
bright
thought
that
came
to
tip
just
then
why
not
find
his
acrostic
in
the
bible
and
write
it
out
among
so
many
verses
he
would
be
sure
to
find
what
he
wanted
but
then
how
very
queer
it
would
be
for
tip
lewis
to
copy
anything
from
the
bible
what
would
the
boys
think
what
would
bob
turner
say
still
what
else
could
he
do
besides
his
and
a
worn
arithmetic
it
was
the
only
book
that
he
had
in
the
world
i
do
care
he
said
suddenly
after
a
few
moments
of
troubled
thought
i
guess
i
ai
ashamed
of
my
bible
it
the
only
thing
got
that
i
need
be
ashamed
of
i
it
the
boys
have
got
to
know
that
i
turned
over
a
new
leaf
i
wish
they
did
the
sooner
they
know
it
the
better
i
say
my
lamp
shall
help
me
out
of
this
scrape
that
as
true
as
can
be
it
helps
me
whenever
i
give
it
a
chance
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
an
old
stump
of
a
pencil
the
next
thing
was
a
piece
of
paper
he
dived
his
hand
down
into
another
pocket
producing
a
rusty
knife
pieces
of
string
a
chestnut
or
two
and
finally
a
crumpled
piece
of
paper
on
which
bob
turner
had
scrawled
what
he
called
a
likeness
of
burrows
and
given
to
tip
for
a
keepsake
he
spread
it
out
on
a
flat
stone
which
lay
near
him
and
began
his
work
a
long
slow
work
it
was
for
tip
hours
of
that
day
and
the
next
and
the
next
every
day
until
the
fading
light
drove
him
home
did
he
sit
under
the
turning
the
leaves
of
his
bible
poring
over
its
contents
writing
words
carefully
now
and
then
on
his
bit
of
paper
remember
it
was
new
work
to
him
at
last
one
evening
the
sun
went
down
in
the
bright
red
west
the
stars
shone
out
in
all
their
twinkling
sparkling
glory
the
shadows
began
to
fall
thick
and
fast
around
the
old
tree
when
tip
with
a
little
sigh
of
relief
folded
the
precious
piece
of
paper
laid
it
carefully
away
in
his
bible
and
turned
his
steps
homeward
his
acrostic
was
finished
and
into
his
heart
had
crept
some
of
the
beauty
of
those
precious
words
which
he
had
found
for
the
first
time
words
they
were
which
would
go
with
him
through
all
his
life
and
sweetly
comfort
some
dark
and
weary
hours
the
were
all
piled
neatly
on
the
desks
that
friday
afternoon
the
shades
were
dropped
to
shut
out
the
low
afternoon
sun
and
forty
boys
were
still
and
expectant
the
acrostics
lay
in
a
great
white
heap
on
burrows
desk
not
a
name
written
on
any
of
them
burrows
was
to
read
and
the
boys
were
to
have
the
pleasure
of
spelling
out
the
names
of
the
owners
as
he
read
a
merry
time
they
had
of
it
that
afternoon
some
wonderful
acrostics
were
read
ellis
holbrook
had
a
very
clever
one
arranged
from
his
lesson
in
virgil
howard
minturn
had
borrowed
from
his
father
library
a
copy
of
shakespeare
and
worked
hard
over
his
the
boys
and
their
teacher
thought
it
a
success
even
bob
turner
had
written
the
idea
had
happened
to
strike
him
as
a
very
funny
one
and
bob
always
did
everything
that
he
thought
funny
he
had
found
three
lines
in
rhyme
which
just
suited
him
and
by
the
time
the
eager
boys
had
spelled
out
b
o
b
which
was
the
only
name
the
boy
saw
fit
to
own
the
schoolroom
fairly
shook
with
their
laughter
next
to
his
lay
a
paper
which
tip
knew
and
his
heart
beat
so
loudly
when
burrows
took
it
up
that
he
thought
every
one
in
the
room
must
notice
the
room
had
now
grown
quiet
and
burrows
after
opening
the
paper
announced
the
title
what
jesus
christ
says
then
read
slowly
and
reverently
while
the
wondering
scholars
spelled
out
the
name
e
even
the
night
shall
lie
light
about
thee
d
depart
from
evil
and
do
good
w
whosoever
cometh
unto
me
i
will
in
no
wise
cast
out
a
a
new
heart
will
i
give
you
r
resist
the
devil
and
he
will
flee
from
you
d
draw
nigh
to
god
and
he
will
draw
nigh
to
thee
l
lo
i
am
with
you
always
e
ever
follow
that
which
is
good
w
whosoever
abideth
in
him
sinneth
not
i
i
will
go
before
thee
and
make
the
crooked
paths
straight
s
so
that
we
may
boldly
say
the
lord
is
my
helper
what
a
silent
and
astonished
company
listened
to
this
reading
and
spelled
the
name
edward
lewis
edward
burrows
said
at
last
who
found
those
verses
for
you
i
found
them
sir
in
my
bible
i
got
them
all
marked
speaking
eagerly
willing
this
time
to
bring
proof
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
burrows
voice
almost
trembled
as
he
answered
it
is
a
beautiful
collection
of
some
of
the
most
precious
verses
in
the
bible
it
was
a
fine
idea
i
am
very
much
surprised
and
pleased
i
wish
that
you
and
every
scholar
of
mine
could
feel
in
your
hearts
the
full
meaning
of
those
words
of
jesus
i
ca
howard
said
ellis
holbrook
in
answer
to
his
friend
coaxings
to
accompany
him
home
i
got
something
else
to
attend
to
hallo
tip
tip
lewis
hold
on
a
bit
i
going
your
way
no
howard
i
come
up
in
the
morning
i
really
tip
waited
in
wondering
silence
while
the
boy
whom
he
counted
an
enemy
hurried
towards
him
ellis
was
a
bold
prompt
boy
when
he
had
anything
to
say
he
it
so
he
came
to
the
point
at
once
see
here
tip
did
i
blunder
the
other
day
when
i
told
burrows
you
threw
paper
i
thought
i
saw
you
yes
said
tip
you
did
i
did
throw
a
bit
of
paper
that
day
well
father
said
he
thought
i
was
mistaken
i
sure
i
supposed
i
was
telling
the
truth
i
sorry
i
say
so
to
burrows
and
the
boys
if
you
like
and
let
him
find
out
who
did
it
and
then
was
mean
enough
to
see
you
whipped
for
it
tip
struggled
a
little
no
he
said
at
last
let
it
go
the
whipping
is
done
and
ca
be
undone
i
do
want
to
make
any
more
bother
about
it
ellis
eyed
him
curiously
you
a
queer
fellow
he
said
at
last
i
expect
you
had
about
the
best
acrostic
this
afternoon
that
can
be
written
tip
heart
was
throbbing
with
pleasure
as
he
walked
on
home
after
ellis
had
left
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
earnest
warm
hearty
praise
from
his
teacher
ellis
had
said
father
told
me
he
thought
i
was
mistaken
holbrook
then
did
believe
and
trust
him
besides
there
was
another
thought
which
seemed
delightful
to
him
tip
lewis
the
worthless
yes
wicked
boy
that
everybody
thought
him
had
walked
down
the
main
street
side
by
side
and
talking
earnestly
with
ellis
holbrook
the
minister
son
chapter
x
enter
not
into
the
path
of
the
wicked
kitty
hung
on
the
gate
and
watched
them
pass
by
the
long
train
of
high
waggons
with
grated
windows
out
of
which
strange
animals
peered
with
their
great
fierce
eyes
the
two
elephants
in
their
scarlet
and
gold
blankets
the
tiny
ponies
tossing
their
shaggy
manes
the
splendid
carriage
drawn
by
eight
gaily
blanketed
gaily
plumed
dancing
horses
and
every
seat
filled
with
splendidly
dressed
men
and
women
the
bright
red
with
the
sun
glittering
over
the
wonderful
brass
instruments
and
turning
them
into
gold
kitty
watched
all
this
watched
and
listened
to
the
loud
full
bursts
of
music
until
her
heart
swelled
and
bounded
she
sprang
from
the
gate
and
stamped
her
foot
on
the
ground
i
wish
oh
i
wish
i
could
go
she
almost
screamed
at
last
i
want
to
i
to
oh
i
never
wanted
to
go
anywhere
so
bad
in
my
life
i
reckon
you
take
it
out
in
wanting
said
her
mother
who
had
also
leaned
on
the
fence
and
watched
the
show
pass
by
folks
who
have
to
dig
as
i
do
from
morning
to
night
just
to
get
something
to
eat
do
have
any
money
to
spend
on
circuses
kitty
shook
her
head
with
rage
i
do
go
anywhere
she
screamed
never
i
never
went
to
a
circus
in
my
life
and
all
the
boys
and
girls
around
here
go
every
year
tip
always
goes
always
he
manages
to
slip
in
oh
tip
and
she
opened
the
gate
and
went
out
to
him
on
the
sidewalk
a
new
thought
having
come
to
her
ca
you
do
something
to
get
some
money
and
let
me
go
to
the
circus
with
you
ca
you
manage
some
way
oh
tip
do
i
do
anything
for
you
if
you
only
will
i
never
wanted
anything
so
bad
before
and
tip
face
as
he
walked
towards
the
village
ten
minutes
after
that
was
a
study
it
looked
so
full
of
trouble
kitty
wanted
to
go
to
that
circus
wanted
to
go
so
very
much
that
she
had
coaxed
and
begged
him
in
a
way
that
she
had
never
done
before
besides
if
the
truth
be
told
tip
wanted
to
go
himself
every
time
the
wind
wafted
back
to
him
a
swell
of
the
distant
music
it
made
his
heart
fairly
jump
it
was
true
as
kitty
had
said
he
always
managed
to
slip
in
some
way
and
the
oftener
he
went
the
oftener
he
wanted
to
go
well
then
what
was
the
matter
with
tip
what
he
had
done
so
many
times
before
he
could
surely
find
a
way
to
do
again
oh
yes
but
tip
lewis
was
different
from
any
tip
lewis
there
had
ever
been
before
on
circus
day
was
he
trying
to
do
right
but
then
what
had
circuses
to
do
with
that
he
tried
to
think
what
were
his
reasons
for
being
troubled
why
did
a
small
voice
down
in
his
heart
keep
telling
him
that
the
circus
was
no
place
for
him
now
looking
at
the
matter
steadily
the
only
reason
tip
knew
was
that
ellis
holbrook
and
howard
minturn
never
went
their
fathers
had
taught
them
differently
ellis
he
knew
rather
looked
down
on
people
who
did
go
called
them
low
this
had
never
troubled
tip
before
because
he
had
always
known
himself
to
be
low
but
now
was
he
trying
to
climb
did
respectable
people
generally
think
that
circuses
were
bad
things
no
poor
tip
they
did
there
was
bailey
a
rich
man
so
rich
and
so
respectable
that
his
son
would
stoop
to
lend
tip
his
at
school
yet
bailey
went
to
the
circus
last
year
and
took
all
his
children
so
did
anderson
and
stone
and
oh
dozens
of
others
rich
great
men
well
did
good
people
go
and
tip
thoughts
strayed
back
to
holbrook
and
parker
and
minturn
yea
and
others
whose
voices
he
had
heard
on
the
streets
and
in
stores
condemning
the
circus
but
then
after
all
where
was
the
harm
there
was
kitty
how
much
she
wanted
to
go
if
he
could
manage
to
take
her
how
glad
she
would
be
at
this
point
satan
thought
there
was
a
chance
for
him
to
speak
so
he
walked
along
with
tip
talking
like
this
kitty
has
never
asked
you
to
do
anything
for
her
before
you
want
to
help
her
you
want
to
get
her
to
go
to
sunday
school
and
to
read
the
bible
now
your
time
if
you
take
her
to
the
circus
very
likely
she
will
do
what
you
want
her
to
this
was
a
little
too
absurd
even
for
tip
who
wanted
to
believe
it
all
so
badly
but
who
ever
heard
of
taking
any
one
to
a
circus
in
order
to
get
them
to
love
jesus
tip
knew
altogether
too
well
for
his
comfort
that
day
that
holbrook
example
was
the
safe
one
at
last
he
drew
a
little
sigh
of
relief
he
need
think
about
it
any
more
for
he
had
no
money
he
had
never
owned
fifty
cents
at
one
time
in
his
life
so
the
question
after
all
would
settle
itself
no
it
would
dewey
stood
in
the
door
of
his
market
looking
up
and
down
the
street
hallo
tip
he
called
as
tip
turned
the
corner
you
the
boy
i
must
have
been
looking
for
i
guess
if
you
carry
home
packages
for
me
for
an
hour
and
not
steal
one
of
them
i
give
you
two
tickets
for
the
circus
tip
cheeks
glowed
at
the
word
steal
and
he
came
near
telling
dewey
to
carry
his
own
packages
if
he
were
afraid
to
trust
him
but
then
those
two
tickets
here
was
a
chance
for
kitty
the
conflict
commenced
again
a
whole
hour
in
which
to
decide
it
for
tip
meant
to
do
the
work
any
way
up
and
down
the
streets
stopping
at
this
house
and
that
with
his
parcels
back
again
to
the
market
for
more
all
the
time
in
a
whirl
of
thought
the
question
was
almost
decided
when
the
two
green
tickets
were
placed
in
his
hand
it
closed
over
them
eagerly
he
hurried
towards
home
towards
home
led
him
past
the
brick
hotel
in
the
sat
some
of
the
circus
men
he
knew
them
by
their
heavy
beards
which
almost
covered
their
faces
knew
them
also
because
he
knew
every
man
in
town
just
who
were
strangers
and
who
were
not
well
these
circus
men
were
very
busy
drinking
brandy
and
playing
cards
tip
stopped
and
looked
in
at
them
and
ignorant
boy
as
he
was
the
thought
that
good
respectable
people
would
go
to
see
and
hear
such
men
as
these
seemed
very
strange
it
could
be
right
could
it
how
was
it
a
great
many
nice
people
must
have
blundered
terribly
if
it
were
wrong
and
on
the
other
hand
if
it
were
not
wrong
how
did
the
minister
happen
to
be
so
afraid
of
these
things
why
did
he
himself
have
so
many
queer
feelings
about
the
matter
what
a
trouble
he
was
in
if
only
he
could
find
somebody
or
something
that
would
decide
it
for
him
long
before
this
he
had
walked
away
from
the
hotel
now
he
had
crossed
the
bridge
gone
around
behind
the
mill
and
was
very
near
his
seat
under
the
elm
down
he
sat
when
he
came
to
it
still
holding
fast
the
two
green
tickets
but
with
the
other
hand
diving
down
in
his
pocket
for
the
little
bible
that
was
getting
to
be
a
habit
with
him
to
hunt
for
this
lamp
of
his
whenever
he
was
in
darkness
he
turned
the
leaves
now
with
a
perplexed
face
if
he
only
knew
where
to
turn
for
help
let
me
see
he
said
where
was
that
verse
that
i
learned
for
the
sunday
school
concert
i
liked
the
sound
of
that
it
was
somewhere
in
this
book
full
of
short
queer
verses
i
can
find
it
yes
i
see
it
the
lord
shall
be
thy
confidence
and
shall
keep
thy
foot
from
being
taken
it
did
seem
to
help
him
he
shook
his
head
slowly
still
glancing
on
over
the
verses
until
suddenly
his
listless
look
vanished
and
he
read
aloud
enter
not
into
the
path
of
the
wicked
and
go
not
in
the
way
of
evil
men
avoid
it
pass
not
by
it
turn
from
it
and
pass
away
that
means
them
said
tip
and
me
they
wicked
men
that
certain
they
were
drinking
and
gambling
swearing
too
i
guess
and
this
verse
reads
about
them
just
as
plain
as
day
it
says
go
near
them
says
it
over
and
over
again
and
i
mind
it
i
will
i
take
these
tickets
right
back
to
dewey
so
they
wo
be
here
to
put
me
in
mind
of
going
no
sooner
said
than
done
he
turned
around
and
fairly
galloped
up
the
hill
around
the
corner
and
landed
nearly
breathless
at
the
market
here
dewey
he
said
promptly
i
brought
back
your
tickets
i
do
want
this
time
what
up
now
asked
dewey
coming
out
from
behind
his
desk
and
eyeing
the
panting
boy
curiously
wo
the
tickets
pass
not
if
they
wait
till
i
pass
answered
tip
in
his
prompt
saucy
way
i
ai
going
to
the
circus
not
an
he
added
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
he
meant
it
but
why
not
oh
i
got
reasons
well
now
tip
said
dewey
that
really
astonishing
suppose
you
give
us
a
few
of
your
reasons
we
do
know
what
to
make
of
this
tip
did
know
what
to
say
he
hesitated
and
thought
and
finally
did
the
best
thing
he
spoke
out
boldly
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
wo
go
to
any
more
circuses
i
do
believe
in
as
much
as
i
did
that
was
it
yet
he
had
not
owned
his
master
in
the
answer
neither
was
dewey
satisfied
but
tip
give
us
the
this
is
such
a
sudden
change
you
know
well
said
tip
i
been
reading
about
them
just
now
about
whom
why
them
circus
fellows
they
up
here
at
the
tavern
drinking
and
fighting
and
i
do
know
what
and
i
guess
by
the
looks
of
things
they
pretty
wicked
the
book
i
was
reading
said
do
go
near
wicked
men
turn
around
and
go
the
other
way
and
i
to
and
with
this
tip
whisked
out
of
the
house
and
around
the
corner
dewey
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
world
turns
around
sure
enough
he
said
at
last
how
do
you
know
that
and
minturn
set
his
market
basket
on
the
step
and
fanned
himself
with
his
hat
i
my
own
boy
you
see
give
me
something
for
my
dinner
how
did
you
find
out
that
the
world
turned
around
why
tip
lewis
has
taken
to
preaching
against
circuses
will
you
have
a
roast
minturn
i
gave
him
a
ticket
and
he
just
rushed
in
with
it
and
informed
us
he
was
going
to
circuses
any
more
because
the
bible
says
they
are
wicked
fellows
what
do
you
think
of
that
humph
said
minturn
the
bible
says
it
would
be
better
for
a
man
sometimes
if
a
millstone
were
about
his
neck
and
he
were
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
i
look
out
for
that
if
i
were
you
hurry
up
with
your
meat
i
ought
to
be
at
the
store
tip
went
home
to
kitty
she
still
swung
on
the
gate
at
least
she
was
there
when
he
came
up
oh
tip
she
said
are
you
going
to
take
me
oh
tip
i
never
asked
you
for
anything
before
tip
walked
slowly
up
the
yard
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
troubled
not
knowing
what
to
say
or
how
to
say
it
at
last
he
stopped
and
wheeled
about
kitty
i
ca
i
ca
go
i
could
get
tickets
if
i
dared
but
i
do
mean
to
go
any
more
they
bad
wicked
men
and
trying
to
be
but
kitty
twitched
herself
away
from
him
and
would
hear
any
more
do
go
off
she
said
you
a
mean
ugly
hateful
boy
i
sorry
you
got
so
awful
good
if
you
ca
do
that
little
much
for
me
go
away
and
let
me
alone
even
in
his
sore
trouble
a
little
flash
of
joy
shot
through
tip
heart
he
different
then
kitty
had
noticed
it
she
knew
he
was
trying
to
be
different
there
be
a
little
bit
of
change
in
him
chapter
xi
avoid
it
pass
not
by
it
turn
from
it
and
pass
away
over
and
over
in
his
mind
did
tip
repeat
this
verse
it
seemed
to
sound
all
around
him
and
mixed
up
with
everything
he
did
and
yet
he
went
out
of
the
house
that
evening
and
turned
straight
down
the
street
in
the
direction
leading
to
the
tented
circus
grounds
walking
along
slowly
talking
to
himself
it
wo
do
any
harm
just
to
listen
to
the
music
i
do
mean
to
go
in
of
course
i
do
suppose
i
do
after
all
i
said
to
kitty
besides
i
could
if
i
would
i
have
got
any
ticket
i
just
going
to
walk
down
that
way
and
see
if
there
lots
of
folks
going
and
if
the
music
sounds
nice
avoid
it
pass
not
by
it
oh
yes
tip
knew
he
heard
the
voice
yet
on
he
went
beginning
to
walk
swiftly
only
saying
in
answer
i
ai
going
in
i
could
if
i
wanted
to
and
i
do
want
to
by
and
by
he
came
within
sight
of
the
tents
and
within
sound
of
the
music
which
to
his
untaught
ears
was
wonderfully
beautiful
came
up
even
to
the
very
door
of
the
large
tent
bewitched
to
go
just
a
step
nearer
though
he
did
mean
to
go
in
not
he
yes
the
people
were
crowding
in
douglass
stood
by
the
door
tip
knew
him
very
well
that
is
he
knew
he
lived
in
a
large
house
and
had
plenty
of
money
and
he
knew
when
the
men
were
trying
to
raise
any
money
some
one
was
sure
to
say
go
to
douglass
he
always
ready
to
give
everybody
liked
douglass
he
turned
around
now
from
looking
down
the
road
and
looked
down
at
tip
well
tip
he
said
going
to
the
circus
tip
shook
his
head
what
the
matter
no
money
pity
to
get
so
near
and
not
go
in
is
it
pet
this
last
to
the
dainty
little
girl
whose
hand
he
held
yes
she
answered
with
a
happy
smile
papa
why
do
mamma
come
oh
she
be
along
soon
here
sir
to
the
doorkeeper
handing
him
cents
let
this
ragamuffin
in
in
with
you
tip
and
practise
standing
on
your
head
for
a
month
to
come
it
was
all
done
in
a
hurry
the
doorkeeper
stepped
aside
the
crowd
jostled
and
pushed
against
him
the
music
burst
forth
in
a
new
loud
swell
a
moment
more
and
tip
stood
in
the
room
staring
eagerly
around
him
there
was
enough
to
see
the
seats
were
filling
rapidly
with
gaily
dressed
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
knew
them
many
of
them
had
seen
them
on
the
streets
often
and
often
had
seen
some
of
them
in
sabbath
school
seated
before
their
classes
tip
was
speedily
giving
himself
up
to
enjoyment
hushing
the
small
voice
in
his
heart
one
of
the
nicest
men
in
town
had
let
him
in
yes
and
there
he
was
now
with
his
wife
and
little
girl
douglas
was
not
only
a
teacher
in
the
sabbath
school
but
a
member
of
the
church
if
she
could
go
to
the
circus
why
could
he
so
tip
reasoned
and
nobody
told
him
that
his
lamp
said
every
one
of
us
shall
give
account
of
to
god
presently
the
wonderful
little
shaggy
ponies
trotted
out
and
back
behind
the
curtains
was
one
of
the
riders
he
got
a
peep
of
her
every
now
and
then
in
her
splendid
dress
he
knew
she
would
be
out
pretty
soon
and
then
she
would
ride
oh
that
music
how
it
rolled
around
the
ring
tip
was
too
busy
looking
and
listening
to
keep
out
of
people
way
he
stepped
back
still
jostled
by
the
crowd
who
were
pouring
in
and
stepped
directly
in
front
of
a
man
who
was
trying
to
make
his
way
through
the
crowd
around
the
entrance
tip
knew
him
in
an
instant
he
was
one
of
the
circus
men
the
one
with
the
ugly
face
that
he
had
noticed
in
the
morning
it
was
ugly
still
and
red
with
liquor
he
turned
a
pair
of
fiery
eyes
on
tip
and
a
dreadful
oath
fell
from
his
lips
as
he
swung
him
angrily
out
of
his
way
oh
tip
lewis
no
wonder
your
heart
fairly
stops
its
beating
for
an
instant
then
bounds
on
with
rapid
throbs
only
a
few
days
ago
you
listened
to
the
story
of
a
bleeding
dying
saviour
bleeding
and
dying
for
you
and
you
promised
with
honest
tears
that
for
this
you
would
love
and
serve
and
honour
him
for
ever
and
yet
here
you
are
watching
the
tricks
of
men
who
can
speak
that
sacred
name
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
make
even
you
who
are
used
to
this
shudder
and
turn
cold
in
the
name
of
the
saviour
whom
you
love
what
do
you
here
it
was
to
tip
as
if
christ
himself
had
asked
that
question
he
turned
suddenly
and
with
both
hands
pressed
to
his
ears
fairly
fought
his
way
through
the
crowd
let
me
out
let
me
go
he
fairly
shrieked
the
words
at
the
astonished
doorkeeper
who
stood
aside
to
let
him
pass
up
the
hill
with
swift
eager
steps
he
ran
trying
still
to
shut
out
the
ring
of
that
awful
oath
the
sound
of
that
hateful
voice
speaking
the
name
which
had
so
lately
become
to
him
the
one
dear
and
precious
name
in
earth
or
heaven
on
on
up
the
hill
and
then
down
on
the
other
side
stopping
finally
at
the
great
tree
under
the
hill
just
across
the
pond
stopping
and
sitting
down
he
tried
to
think
what
had
he
done
he
had
been
warned
he
had
been
tempted
and
he
had
it
did
help
him
now
to
think
that
good
men
and
women
were
there
perhaps
god
had
not
so
plainly
shown
them
the
wrong
perhaps
they
had
never
found
that
verse
avoid
it
pass
not
by
it
perhaps
oh
it
was
nothing
to
him
now
this
much
was
certain
he
had
done
wrong
such
a
heavy
heart
as
tip
had
what
he
do
what
would
kitty
say
if
she
found
it
out
oh
what
would
dewey
think
or
holbrook
and
then
above
all
else
came
the
thought
what
could
jesus
looking
down
on
him
now
from
heaven
what
could
think
of
him
this
thought
brought
the
bitter
tears
but
it
brought
him
also
on
his
knees
and
he
said
oh
jesus
christ
in
spite
of
it
all
you
i
love
you
wo
you
forgive
me
and
let
me
try
again
long
he
knelt
there
trying
to
get
close
to
christ
and
his
saviour
did
not
leave
him
alone
it
was
only
yesterday
he
had
learned
the
verse
and
it
came
to
him
softly
now
thou
art
a
god
ready
to
pardon
gracious
and
merciful
slow
to
anger
of
great
kindness
in
his
sore
trouble
tip
lamp
had
not
failed
him
chapter
xii
he
honoureth
them
that
fear
the
lord
slowly
but
surely
as
the
late
autumn
days
came
on
tip
was
growing
into
a
better
place
in
the
schoolroom
in
the
opinion
of
his
teachers
and
his
schoolmates
in
burrows
school
ten
was
the
perfect
mark
and
was
the
very
lowest
grade
a
boy
could
reach
it
had
once
been
an
everyday
joke
with
tip
that
being
he
must
be
perfect
because
it
said
in
the
that
was
ten
but
it
had
been
a
good
many
days
since
tip
had
said
the
boys
had
ceased
to
be
amazed
when
he
answered
ten
in
prompt
proud
tone
they
were
growing
many
of
them
to
be
surprised
and
sorry
for
him
when
in
his
days
of
failures
he
answered
with
drooped
eyes
and
very
red
ashamed
face
seven
or
it
might
be
six
though
he
was
still
anything
but
a
good
reader
no
one
could
fail
to
see
that
he
blundered
less
and
less
every
day
and
burrows
was
growing
patient
with
his
blunders
growing
helpful
in
his
troubles
the
boys
saw
him
working
hard
over
his
and
few
of
them
now
had
the
meanness
to
laugh
when
a
word
passed
him
burrows
tones
were
not
so
harsh
to
him
as
they
used
to
be
and
when
he
was
accused
of
breaking
rules
instead
of
being
called
up
and
unhesitatingly
punished
his
teacher
who
grew
every
day
less
and
less
sure
that
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
mischief
done
always
gave
him
a
chance
to
speak
for
himself
and
was
learning
to
believe
him
oh
yes
things
were
different
and
were
all
the
time
growing
more
so
bob
turner
saw
this
plainly
he
began
to
find
tip
a
very
stupid
companion
and
stayed
away
from
school
more
afternoons
than
ever
but
poor
tip
noticed
the
change
less
yes
much
less
than
any
of
the
others
you
do
know
how
hard
it
was
for
him
do
you
think
satan
was
willing
to
leave
him
and
let
him
grow
quietly
into
a
good
boy
not
a
bit
of
it
you
see
he
had
been
born
bubbling
over
with
fun
and
frolic
he
had
never
learned
to
have
them
come
in
at
the
right
place
or
the
right
time
sometimes
he
felt
willing
to
give
up
all
trying
to
do
right
for
the
sake
of
having
a
grand
frolic
just
when
and
where
he
wanted
it
no
matter
what
might
be
going
on
just
then
sometimes
when
he
failed
he
felt
fierce
and
sullen
and
told
himself
it
was
all
humbug
this
trying
to
be
good
sometimes
he
felt
so
utterly
sad
and
discouraged
that
it
seemed
to
him
he
never
could
try
again
yet
through
it
all
he
try
heartily
his
arithmetic
was
the
hardest
he
was
still
in
the
dunce
class
so
the
boys
called
it
because
it
was
made
up
of
the
drones
from
several
classes
and
was
constantly
being
put
back
to
addition
it
was
a
sharp
winter
morning
no
more
winter
for
a
while
the
snow
lay
white
and
crisp
on
the
ground
and
the
frosty
air
stung
every
nose
and
every
finger
it
could
reach
tip
study
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
under
the
elm
had
been
quite
broken
up
and
he
found
it
very
hard
to
study
at
home
especially
this
morning
his
father
cough
had
been
bad
all
night
and
this
made
his
mother
troubled
and
cross
kitty
these
days
seemed
trying
to
see
just
how
cross
and
disagreeable
she
could
be
and
the
kitchen
at
best
a
dismal
place
was
just
now
at
the
worst
the
wet
wood
in
the
stove
sizzled
and
stewed
and
made
a
smoke
and
in
the
midst
of
tip
fifth
trial
on
an
example
which
was
puzzling
him
terribly
he
was
called
on
to
split
some
kindlings
this
instant
i
wo
wait
a
minute
kitty
said
in
a
provokingly
commanding
tone
and
tip
went
at
it
sullenly
saying
with
every
spiteful
drive
of
his
axe
through
the
pine
board
which
he
had
picked
up
it
no
use
i
do
that
sum
and
i
ai
going
to
try
i
do
know
anything
and
never
will
i
done
it
over
fifty
times
and
twisted
it
every
way
i
can
think
of
there
no
sense
to
it
any
way
sixteen
sheep
him
two
dollars
apiece
what
does
that
mean
i
like
to
know
he
had
forty
sheep
and
cows
i
know
it
all
by
heart
but
i
ca
do
it
and
that
the
whole
of
it
i
wish
his
sheep
had
choked
to
death
and
his
old
cows
run
away
before
i
ever
heard
of
them
i
go
over
it
just
once
more
tip
was
back
by
the
kitchen
window
now
with
his
slate
and
book
let
see
cows
at
dollars
apiece
and
he
worked
away
in
nervous
haste
until
he
came
to
stood
him
in
if
he
only
find
out
what
that
meant
he
felt
sure
he
could
do
it
if
he
had
somebody
to
help
him
but
he
had
there
would
be
no
time
after
he
went
to
school
before
the
class
was
called
just
then
he
thought
of
his
father
he
used
to
be
a
carpenter
before
he
was
sick
and
he
used
to
make
a
great
many
figures
sometimes
on
smooth
boards
tip
remembered
it
was
just
possible
that
he
might
know
something
about
the
sum
suppose
he
should
ask
him
he
started
up
suddenly
and
went
towards
the
bedroom
door
father
he
said
softly
ca
you
tell
me
what
him
in
means
the
sick
man
turned
himself
on
his
pillow
and
looked
wonderingly
at
tip
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
at
last
why
said
tip
in
a
despairing
tone
it
says
him
in
in
the
arithmetic
the
sheep
stood
him
in
two
dollars
apiece
and
i
do
see
any
sense
to
it
oh
said
lewis
i
see
what
you
mean
then
he
went
back
to
his
deserted
carpenter
shop
why
tip
if
i
had
ten
pounds
of
nails
and
they
were
worth
eight
cents
a
pound
they
would
stand
me
just
so
much
that
is
they
would
be
worth
that
to
me
and
if
i
should
sell
them
i
get
so
much
for
them
do
you
see
light
began
to
dawn
on
tip
mind
then
it
means
he
said
that
the
man
did
sell
his
sixteen
sheep
he
just
counted
them
worth
two
dollars
apiece
yes
i
see
if
that
it
i
try
it
and
he
rushed
to
his
work
again
and
tip
will
never
forget
the
eagerness
with
which
he
presently
turned
to
the
answer
in
his
arithmetic
and
from
that
back
to
the
one
on
the
slate
nor
the
way
in
which
the
blood
bounded
through
his
veins
when
he
found
that
they
agreed
perfectly
it
exactly
it
he
called
out
to
his
father
in
a
hearty
grateful
voice
i
got
it
and
i
been
at
work
on
it
this
whole
morning
ellis
holbrook
about
that
time
conquered
a
most
puzzling
example
in
algebra
but
he
felt
not
prouder
than
did
tip
thomas
said
burrows
to
the
head
boy
in
tip
arithmetic
class
you
may
take
the
example
to
the
board
ca
do
it
answered
thomas
promptly
henry
may
do
it
then
i
could
get
it
either
was
henry
answer
so
on
down
the
class
tip
heart
meantime
beating
eagerly
for
the
example
was
about
his
troublesome
but
by
this
time
very
sheep
robert
said
burrows
more
for
form
sake
than
because
he
had
the
slightest
doubt
about
robert
reply
my
said
bob
turner
i
ca
do
it
tip
sat
next
and
something
in
his
face
made
burrows
put
the
question
to
him
though
he
had
nearly
resolved
to
waste
no
more
time
in
the
matter
can
you
do
this
edward
yes
sir
said
tip
promptly
and
proudly
i
can
and
no
nobler
figures
or
firmer
lines
did
chalk
ever
make
on
a
blackboard
than
was
made
while
that
troublesome
example
was
being
done
he
was
roused
from
his
flutter
of
satisfaction
by
hearing
burrows
voice
do
you
know
anything
about
the
lesson
of
you
i
sure
do
answered
bob
still
burrows
was
growing
utterly
out
of
patience
this
same
scene
had
been
acted
too
often
to
be
endured
longer
he
turned
back
to
the
first
pages
in
the
book
very
well
he
said
at
last
you
may
take
the
first
page
in
addition
morning
and
we
see
if
you
can
be
made
to
know
anything
about
that
tip
hopes
fell
his
heart
was
as
heavy
as
lead
not
one
of
the
others
cared
they
were
used
to
it
so
indeed
was
he
only
now
he
was
trying
he
did
so
long
to
go
on
just
when
he
was
working
hard
to
be
put
away
back
to
the
beginning
again
made
him
feel
utterly
disgraced
wait
a
minute
tip
burrows
eye
fell
first
on
him
then
on
the
neatly
and
correctly
worked
example
then
he
turned
and
asked
charlie
wilcox
on
what
page
is
your
arithmetic
lesson
for
we
commence
multiplication
sir
answered
charlie
a
bright
little
boy
who
belonged
to
a
bright
class
that
did
not
idle
over
any
pages
in
their
work
edward
said
burrows
turning
back
to
tip
you
have
done
well
you
mean
to
study
after
this
i
think
i
have
been
watching
you
for
some
time
the
third
arithmetic
class
take
the
first
page
in
multiplication
for
their
next
lesson
you
may
take
your
place
in
that
class
and
remain
there
as
long
as
you
can
keep
up
with
it
now
tip
was
too
much
astonished
to
speak
or
move
his
wildest
dreams
had
not
taken
in
promotion
at
least
not
for
a
long
time
bob
turner
leaned
over
and
looked
at
him
in
actual
sober
wonder
that
tip
was
to
be
in
a
higher
class
not
a
word
did
tip
say
he
did
not
even
raise
his
eyes
to
his
face
and
that
teacher
had
not
the
least
idea
how
the
boy
before
him
felt
he
did
not
know
how
tip
heart
was
throbbing
nor
how
he
was
saying
over
and
over
to
himself
things
are
different
they
surely
different
he
did
not
know
how
those
few
words
of
his
spoken
that
winter
morning
were
going
to
help
to
make
the
boy
a
man
it
was
that
very
morning
standing
in
that
room
before
the
blackboard
with
his
toe
on
the
third
crack
from
the
wall
that
tip
resolved
to
have
an
education
chapter
xiii
the
rich
and
poor
meet
together
the
lord
is
the
maker
of
them
all
the
boys
gathered
around
the
stove
before
school
and
talked
the
boys
not
all
of
them
by
any
means
only
that
small
select
number
who
were
above
and
led
all
the
rest
tip
wandered
outside
of
the
circle
feeling
very
forlorn
he
did
belong
anywhere
these
days
bob
and
his
friends
had
very
nearly
deserted
him
there
was
scarcely
any
of
their
fun
in
which
he
had
time
or
desire
to
join
and
the
other
cliques
in
school
had
never
noticed
him
so
he
stood
outside
and
wondered
what
he
should
do
with
himself
howard
minturn
wheeled
suddenly
away
from
the
boys
and
called
to
him
tip
see
here
and
tip
went
there
what
do
you
want
he
asked
crossly
for
some
way
he
felt
out
of
sorts
with
that
company
of
boys
around
the
stove
want
you
to
come
over
it
my
birthday
you
know
and
some
of
the
boys
are
coming
to
take
tea
and
spend
the
evening
can
you
come
tip
eyes
spoke
his
astonishment
what
do
you
want
of
me
he
asked
at
last
speaking
boldly
just
what
he
thought
why
i
want
you
to
come
and
help
have
a
nice
time
returned
howard
with
great
kindness
but
just
a
little
condescension
in
his
tone
tip
heard
it
and
his
bitterness
showed
itself
a
little
it
a
new
streak
you
got
ai
it
he
said
still
speaking
crossly
had
lots
of
birthdays
and
this
is
the
first
one
heard
of
oh
well
said
howard
proudly
flushing
as
he
spoke
if
you
do
want
to
come
why
burrows
hand
was
laid
on
howard
arm
do
spoil
a
good
noble
thing
my
boy
it
is
all
new
to
edward
him
burrows
spoke
low
so
no
one
else
could
hear
him
and
turned
away
at
recess
howard
sought
out
tip
i
honestly
hope
you
come
tip
for
you
a
good
fellow
to
play
games
with
and
the
boys
would
all
like
to
have
you
tip
had
quarrelled
with
his
and
it
had
vanished
i
come
he
said
in
a
cheery
tone
only
i
look
like
a
big
by
the
side
of
fellows
never
mind
said
howard
turning
to
join
the
boys
come
why
had
howard
minturn
invited
him
to
the
grand
birthday
party
this
was
the
question
that
puzzled
tip
had
he
known
the
reason
it
would
have
been
like
this
minturn
had
never
quite
lost
sight
of
tip
since
the
circus
he
wanted
to
help
him
wanted
to
do
it
through
his
son
only
he
wanted
the
son
to
think
that
he
did
it
himself
knowing
howard
pretty
well
he
said
when
they
were
seated
at
breakfast
that
morning
i
just
been
reading
about
a
real
hero
howard
longed
to
be
a
hero
he
looked
up
eagerly
who
was
he
father
what
did
he
do
he
was
a
rich
young
man
and
he
had
the
courage
to
take
for
his
friend
a
poor
fellow
who
had
two
cents
to
his
name
to
pay
him
the
time
came
when
he
was
proud
to
be
noticed
by
the
great
man
who
was
once
so
low
this
thought
was
still
in
howard
mind
when
he
walked
with
ellis
to
school
so
when
ellis
said
there
goes
tip
lewis
father
thinks
we
boys
ought
to
notice
him
he
is
trying
real
hard
to
behave
himself
you
know
it
was
easy
for
howard
to
mingle
tip
in
with
his
thoughts
ellis
he
said
after
a
moment
silence
suppose
i
invite
him
to
come
to
our
house
he
a
splendid
good
fellow
to
have
a
game
never
gets
mad
you
know
he
come
asked
ellis
yes
of
course
jump
at
the
chance
do
our
boys
will
think
it
odd
i
suppose
but
i
guess
i
have
courage
enough
to
do
as
i
please
and
howard
drew
himself
up
proudly
and
thought
of
his
father
hero
so
this
was
why
tip
was
invited
to
the
birthday
gathering
at
the
grand
house
on
the
hill
lewis
sewed
that
afternoon
on
his
jacket
mending
it
up
more
neatly
than
ever
before
she
had
said
very
little
about
this
invitation
but
she
could
help
feeling
proud
and
gratified
over
it
it
was
certainly
a
wonderful
jump
for
tip
from
mingling
with
the
worst
and
lowest
boys
in
town
to
find
himself
taking
a
long
stride
and
reaching
the
very
top
so
lewis
sewed
and
kitty
as
she
sat
watching
the
needle
fly
back
and
forth
spoke
her
thoughts
all
of
the
boys
down
to
burrows
school
wear
white
collars
on
their
jackets
well
answered
her
mother
snappishly
what
that
to
me
they
wear
white
on
their
jackets
i
could
get
him
one
just
as
easy
as
it
was
a
sore
subject
with
lewis
from
her
very
heart
she
wished
she
could
dress
tip
in
broadcloth
just
as
fine
as
that
which
howard
minturn
himself
wore
and
a
collar
so
white
and
shiny
that
it
would
fairly
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
others
to
look
upon
it
but
since
she
was
so
powerless
to
do
what
she
would
it
made
her
cross
the
bedroom
door
was
open
and
tip
father
heard
by
and
by
when
his
cough
was
quieter
he
called
kitty
and
the
little
girl
went
in
to
him
is
the
jacket
fixed
kitty
yes
does
it
look
nice
some
would
you
like
to
find
a
collar
for
tip
to
wear
well
enough
said
kitty
wonderingly
well
now
i
got
two
or
three
that
i
do
wear
any
more
and
never
shall
i
guess
this
last
spoken
sadly
you
take
one
of
they
in
that
square
box
under
the
table
and
see
if
you
ca
sew
it
on
the
jacket
and
make
it
look
like
what
the
other
boys
wear
now
you
try
what
you
can
do
just
to
see
what
tip
will
say
kitty
went
slowly
over
to
the
box
this
was
new
work
for
her
but
her
father
was
very
pale
and
those
words
and
never
shall
i
guess
had
quieted
her
so
she
made
no
answer
but
drew
out
one
of
the
collars
it
looked
nice
and
white
and
shone
too
lewis
had
done
it
up
late
one
night
with
tears
in
her
eyes
because
she
could
not
hope
that
it
would
be
worn
again
what
are
you
doing
with
that
she
asked
sharply
as
kitty
appeared
from
the
bedroom
father
wants
tip
to
wear
it
answered
kitty
i
lend
it
to
him
spoke
the
sick
man
we
want
him
to
look
as
decent
as
we
can
you
know
lewis
said
no
more
but
it
seemed
to
her
like
giving
up
one
more
hope
of
her
husband
life
tip
came
down
from
the
garret
with
hair
and
dressed
in
his
clean
shirt
nicely
mended
jacket
and
the
shiny
collar
it
was
wonderful
what
a
difference
that
collar
made
he
did
look
like
the
same
boy
kitty
he
said
his
face
all
aglow
with
pleasure
where
i
get
a
collar
it
father
he
said
wear
it
answered
kitty
and
how
did
it
get
on
my
jacket
jumped
on
likely
kitty
spoke
in
a
short
half
provoked
tone
she
was
so
unused
to
doing
a
kind
thing
that
she
really
felt
half
ashamed
of
it
well
said
tip
smiling
all
over
his
face
if
that
so
it
the
best
jump
it
ever
took
and
i
thank
it
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
then
he
carried
his
bright
face
out
of
the
little
house
in
the
hollow
and
went
towards
the
great
house
on
the
hill
chapter
xiv
every
idle
word
that
men
shall
speak
they
shall
give
account
thereof
in
the
day
of
judgment
howard
minturn
was
a
king
among
the
schoolboys
so
though
some
of
them
nudged
each
other
and
laughed
a
little
when
tip
swung
open
the
iron
gate
and
appeared
in
minturn
grounds
the
most
of
them
seeing
how
quickly
howard
sprang
forward
and
how
heartily
he
greeted
the
newcomer
did
the
same
howard
was
his
father
over
again
if
he
did
a
thing
at
all
he
did
it
well
every
moment
of
that
afternoon
was
enjoyed
as
only
boys
know
how
to
enjoy
holidays
the
whole
round
of
winter
fun
was
gone
through
with
coasting
snowballing
building
forts
rolling
in
the
snow
each
had
their
turn
tip
was
not
one
whit
behind
the
rest
in
all
these
matters
and
if
ever
boy
enjoyed
an
afternoon
he
did
that
one
the
sun
had
set
in
its
clear
cold
beauty
and
the
sharp
winter
night
was
coming
down
the
boys
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
waiting
for
ellis
and
his
sled
which
were
at
the
top
they
came
at
last
shooting
down
the
glassy
surface
hurry
up
called
out
howard
as
he
spun
along
what
the
mischief
became
of
you
we
thought
you
had
gone
to
hunt
up
sir
john
franklin
and
crew
hurry
down
i
should
say
you
meant
answered
ellis
guiding
his
sled
skilfully
around
the
curve
and
springing
to
his
feet
i
waited
for
the
rest
of
you
thought
you
were
coming
back
no
said
howard
we
just
we
appointed
a
committee
to
find
out
how
many
were
frozen
up
altogether
entirely
and
found
that
every
single
one
of
us
were
so
we
going
in
to
the
library
fire
to
get
thawed
out
by
all
right
said
ellis
shouldering
his
sled
howard
your
skates
oh
bother
they
at
the
top
of
that
awful
hill
never
mind
you
walk
on
slowly
and
i
run
back
and
get
them
the
boys
obeyed
and
ellis
holbrook
was
just
swinging
open
the
little
gate
that
led
to
minturn
grounds
when
howard
called
as
he
ran
down
the
hill
hold
on
do
go
that
way
it
will
lead
you
right
through
the
deepest
snow
there
is
take
the
big
gate
and
by
the
time
he
reached
them
panting
and
breathless
they
were
at
the
big
gate
this
is
jolly
said
will
bailey
throwing
himself
into
a
great
before
the
glowing
fire
my
i
believe
i
a
snowball
you
have
been
an
icicle
if
you
had
gone
the
way
ellis
was
leading
you
why
the
snow
is
so
high
said
howard
raising
his
hand
almost
on
a
level
with
his
head
ellis
laughed
i
sure
i
thought
i
was
going
right
he
said
i
must
have
been
thinking
of
yesterday
lesson
in
sunday
school
ye
in
at
the
strait
gate
ho
said
will
bailey
for
that
matter
one
gate
is
as
straight
as
the
other
you
do
understand
the
bible
my
boy
said
howard
laying
his
hand
on
will
shoulder
with
a
provoking
little
pat
or
you
know
that
strait
means
narrow
i
bet
a
dollar
that
you
were
no
wiser
yourself
until
father
explained
the
verse
yesterday
said
ellis
laughing
tip
meantime
stood
apart
flushed
and
silent
he
knew
about
the
sunday
lesson
and
remembered
the
solemn
talk
which
holbrook
gave
them
and
remembered
how
he
urged
them
while
they
were
young
to
enter
into
that
strait
gate
he
felt
shocked
and
troubled
at
the
sound
of
careless
words
i
know
one
thing
he
said
abruptly
do
you
said
will
bailey
in
a
mocking
tone
that
very
strange
will
felt
above
tip
and
took
care
to
let
him
know
it
ellis
turned
a
quick
indignant
glance
on
him
then
spoke
to
tip
in
a
kind
and
interested
tone
what
were
you
going
to
say
tip
that
if
i
were
the
minister
son
i
would
make
fun
of
the
bible
ellis
face
was
crimson
in
an
instant
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
asked
haughtily
just
what
i
say
was
tip
cool
reply
do
you
pretend
to
say
that
make
fun
of
the
bible
humph
did
i
hear
you
no
said
ellis
in
a
heat
you
and
i
thank
you
not
to
say
so
neither
well
now
said
tip
i
leave
it
to
any
boy
here
if
you
did
when
a
fellow
takes
a
thing
in
the
bible
and
twists
it
around
and
makes
believe
it
means
some
little
silly
thing
that
it
do
mean
at
all
i
call
that
making
fun
poh
said
howard
coming
to
the
rescue
of
his
friend
what
a
fuss
you
making
about
nothing
you
getting
wise
are
you
tip
ellis
was
only
saying
that
verse
in
fun
just
as
lots
of
people
do
i
heard
good
men
quote
the
bible
and
laugh
over
it
ca
help
that
said
tip
boldly
i
say
it
wicked
and
ellis
holbrook
father
says
so
too
i
heard
him
tell
will
bailey
once
that
folks
ought
to
be
very
careful
how
they
said
things
that
were
in
the
bible
did
he
tell
you
to
go
around
preaching
for
him
through
the
week
how
much
does
he
pay
you
for
your
services
come
let
hear
this
was
said
in
will
bailey
most
disagreeable
tone
before
tip
had
time
to
answer
ellis
spoke
again
well
i
do
pretend
to
be
as
good
as
some
people
are
but
i
really
ca
see
any
awful
wickedness
in
anything
that
i
said
neither
can
anybody
else
except
tip
said
will
and
he
good
you
know
he
never
does
anything
wrong
except
to
tell
lies
and
swear
or
some
little
matters
ellis
was
an
honest
boy
no
he
said
gravely
there
is
no
use
in
saying
what
is
true
for
the
sake
of
helping
my
side
along
tip
do
either
of
those
things
i
believe
but
i
sure
i
thank
him
for
his
good
opinion
of
me
howard
was
glad
at
this
moment
to
hear
the
peal
through
the
house
for
the
boys
were
growing
cross
most
of
them
had
been
so
astonished
at
the
bold
stand
which
tip
had
taken
that
they
said
nothing
only
gathered
round
and
waited
to
see
what
would
come
next
howard
sprang
up
there
something
i
for
one
am
ready
for
come
boys
and
he
led
the
way
to
the
oh
that
with
its
bright
lights
and
splendid
table
was
such
a
wonderful
sight
to
tip
it
was
a
very
nice
birthday
supper
plates
of
warm
biscuit
platters
of
cold
chicken
dishes
of
beautiful
honey
silver
filled
with
cake
tip
for
one
had
never
seen
such
a
sight
in
his
life
before
and
he
was
so
bewildered
with
the
dazzle
and
glitter
that
he
did
know
which
way
to
turn
howard
said
minturn
turning
to
her
son
after
she
had
welcomed
his
friends
do
you
want
your
father
to
take
the
head
of
the
table
or
would
you
and
the
boys
prefer
having
the
room
to
yourselves
no
answered
howard
with
energy
we
want
you
and
father
i
guess
i
want
to
my
party
whoever
else
i
have
tip
watched
the
bright
light
on
howard
face
with
surprise
how
much
he
seemed
to
love
his
mother
and
how
much
she
loved
him
how
queer
it
was
the
supper
was
a
great
success
the
boys
forgot
their
excitement
and
and
enjoyed
everything
it
was
almost
nine
the
hour
when
it
was
generally
understood
that
the
party
was
to
break
up
the
boys
had
been
very
merry
all
the
evening
the
discussion
which
had
taken
place
just
before
tea
seemed
to
have
been
forgotten
save
by
ellis
who
genial
and
hearty
enough
with
the
others
was
cold
and
haughty
to
tip
still
they
kept
apart
and
the
fun
had
gone
on
famously
there
was
a
sudden
lull
in
the
uproar
when
minturn
opened
the
door
are
the
walls
left
he
asked
coming
forward
the
said
ellis
inquiringly
why
sir
did
you
expect
to
miss
them
well
i
had
some
such
fears
but
i
see
they
all
right
what
are
you
up
to
ellis
was
telling
a
story
that
what
we
were
laughing
at
when
you
came
in
said
howard
go
on
el
never
mind
father
he
likes
to
hear
stories
no
said
ellis
blushing
crimson
i
think
i
be
excused
go
ahead
said
minturn
i
very
fond
of
stories
i
was
only
telling
sir
how
joe
barnes
talked
to
his
father
when
i
was
down
there
this
morning
yes
and
father
you
be
perfectly
astonished
to
hear
him
chimed
in
howard
i
never
heard
a
fellow
go
on
so
in
my
life
he
makes
fun
of
every
single
thing
his
father
says
do
you
think
there
is
anything
very
surprising
in
that
asked
minturn
coolly
surprising
i
guess
you
think
so
why
when
his
father
is
talking
to
him
real
soberly
he
mimics
him
and
laughs
right
in
his
face
but
i
should
suppose
you
would
think
there
was
anything
strange
about
that
the
boys
looked
puzzled
why
mr
minturn
said
ellis
would
you
think
it
strange
if
howard
should
do
so
well
no
i
do
know
that
i
should
have
any
reason
to
be
astonished
howard
looked
not
only
surprised
but
very
much
hurt
i
sure
father
he
said
in
a
voice
which
trembled
a
little
i
did
know
i
was
so
rude
to
you
as
all
that
no
said
minturn
you
never
have
been
but
i
rather
expect
you
to
commence
i
shall
have
no
reason
to
be
surprised
if
you
and
ellis
and
will
bailey
and
a
host
of
others
all
go
to
making
fun
of
what
your
fathers
say
to
you
after
this
the
boys
seemed
perfectly
astonished
for
one
said
ellis
holbrook
proudly
think
too
much
of
father
to
be
in
any
such
danger
you
said
minturn
well
now
i
amazed
i
supposed
you
would
be
the
very
worst
one
howard
left
the
table
and
came
over
to
where
his
father
had
seated
himself
father
what
you
mean
he
asked
in
an
earnest
anxious
tone
why
i
mean
said
his
father
that
i
was
in
that
room
over
there
just
before
tea
and
i
heard
the
discussion
which
came
up
between
you
boys
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
boys
who
thought
it
such
a
little
matter
to
make
fun
of
solemn
words
which
god
has
said
to
them
need
not
be
expected
to
show
much
respect
for
what
their
father
or
anybody
else
said
a
perfect
stillness
settled
over
the
boys
at
these
words
and
not
only
ellis
holbrook
cheeks
but
his
whole
face
glowed
howard
came
to
the
rescue
at
last
very
stammeringly
but
father
i
do
think
do
you
think
i
mean
well
sir
you
know
ellis
and
the
rest
of
us
did
mean
to
make
fun
of
what
god
said
do
you
think
that
makes
a
difference
i
do
know
i
sure
how
do
you
know
that
joe
barnes
means
to
make
fun
of
what
his
father
says
he
acts
like
it
howard
said
exactly
and
so
do
you
every
one
of
you
except
tip
i
do
say
boys
that
you
are
all
going
to
be
disrespectful
to
your
elders
after
this
i
only
say
i
do
see
why
your
earthly
friends
should
expect
more
reverence
from
you
than
you
give
to
god
boys
and
man
were
all
silent
for
a
little
after
that
until
minturn
broke
the
stillness
by
repeating
reverently
ye
in
at
the
strait
gate
i
guess
you
all
know
what
that
means
i
would
like
to
know
whether
there
is
a
boy
here
who
thinks
he
has
entered
in
at
that
gate
how
still
the
room
was
while
he
waited
for
his
answer
tip
could
feel
his
heart
throb
throb
with
loud
distinct
beats
twice
he
tried
to
break
the
silence
and
could
at
last
he
found
voice
i
do
sir
minturn
turned
quickly
what
makes
you
think
so
tip
because
i
love
jesus
and
i
trying
to
do
what
he
says
minturn
voice
trembled
a
little
god
bless
you
my
boy
try
to
get
all
the
rest
to
go
through
the
same
gate
the
town
clock
struck
the
hour
nine
the
boys
made
a
move
to
separate
tip
took
his
cap
and
walked
out
alone
in
the
cold
clear
starlight
he
felt
quiet
and
strong
it
was
done
at
last
he
had
taken
his
stand
before
the
boys
had
shown
his
colours
they
all
knew
now
that
he
was
trying
hard
and
who
was
helping
him
things
must
surely
be
different
after
this
for
ever
chapter
xv
and
all
things
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
player
believing
ye
shall
receive
meantime
was
kitty
forgotten
not
a
bit
of
it
if
ever
boy
prayed
for
any
one
tip
prayed
for
her
his
very
soul
was
in
it
yet
thus
far
his
prayers
seemed
to
have
been
in
vain
the
lesson
one
sabbath
morning
was
on
god
answers
to
prayer
tip
listened
closely
yet
with
an
unsatisfied
longing
in
his
eyes
holbrook
he
said
waiting
after
the
rest
had
gone
is
there
time
for
just
one
question
yes
for
two
if
you
like
said
holbrook
sitting
down
again
what
is
it
edward
i
want
to
know
why
god
do
answer
folks
prayers
right
away
holbrook
smiled
if
your
questions
are
all
as
hard
as
that
edward
i
do
think
there
will
be
time
for
another
but
there
may
be
several
reasons
we
will
try
to
find
them
sometimes
god
does
answer
our
prayers
at
once
simply
to
try
our
faith
to
see
whether
we
are
willing
to
take
him
at
his
word
and
keep
on
asking
until
he
is
ready
to
give
or
whether
we
will
grow
tired
in
a
little
while
and
give
it
up
and
sometimes
we
spend
all
our
strength
in
praying
and
do
work
then
often
we
do
believe
we
shall
get
what
we
are
praying
for
do
you
understand
me
no
sir
answered
tip
promptly
well
let
me
see
if
i
can
make
it
plainer
for
whom
are
you
praying
edward
that
you
are
troubled
this
morning
because
you
have
not
been
heard
for
kitty
i
have
been
this
long
time
kitty
my
sister
and
i
want
her
to
love
jesus
but
it
do
seem
to
do
any
good
for
me
to
pray
for
her
it
is
that
god
may
be
trying
your
patience
but
not
probable
i
think
we
can
find
a
better
reason
do
you
work
while
you
pray
i
mean
do
you
talk
with
kitty
tell
her
what
you
are
praying
for
urge
her
to
come
to
christ
try
to
show
her
how
tip
looked
grave
i
did
talk
a
little
to
her
once
but
it
did
seem
to
do
her
any
good
and
i
have
said
a
word
since
did
you
ever
read
in
the
bible
what
is
said
about
such
praying
about
saying
in
peace
be
ye
warmed
and
filled
and
not
anything
tip
shook
his
head
and
holbrook
held
out
his
hand
for
the
little
bible
let
me
find
it
for
you
and
when
you
go
home
you
may
read
it
and
see
if
you
in
praying
for
kitty
and
never
saying
a
word
to
her
are
not
a
little
like
that
man
then
there
another
thing
do
you
really
believe
that
god
will
do
what
you
ask
him
you
say
every
day
in
your
prayer
god
make
kitty
a
christian
and
yet
would
you
be
very
much
astonished
if
kitty
should
come
to
you
and
say
want
to
be
a
christian
are
you
looking
out
for
any
such
thing
tip
generally
spoke
his
honest
thoughts
no
he
said
gravely
i
ai
the
church
bell
began
to
ring
and
holbrook
arose
i
think
if
you
begin
to
work
and
pray
together
and
then
ask
god
to
help
you
to
believe
that
he
will
surely
do
as
he
has
promised
that
you
will
soon
find
your
prayers
answered
this
he
said
while
gathering
up
his
books
and
papers
ready
to
start
and
then
edward
why
do
you
come
to
our
thursday
evening
tip
eyes
were
full
of
astonishment
i
never
once
thought
of
it
he
said
why
holbrook
boys
go
do
they
no
said
the
minister
sadly
they
do
because
i
do
know
of
another
boy
of
your
age
in
this
whole
town
who
loves
the
saviour
only
think
what
a
work
there
is
for
you
to
do
tip
went
home
with
his
brain
full
of
new
thoughts
no
he
did
go
home
he
only
went
as
far
as
the
and
there
he
sat
down
and
read
what
holbrook
had
marked
in
his
bible
yes
that
was
just
the
way
in
which
he
had
been
praying
for
kitty
and
it
was
certainly
true
as
holbrook
had
said
nothing
could
surprise
him
more
than
that
kitty
should
really
and
truly
come
to
jesus
before
he
went
from
under
the
tree
that
day
he
prayed
this
prayer
o
god
teach
me
to
believe
that
you
will
make
kitty
love
jesus
and
show
me
how
to
help
her
after
this
of
course
he
looked
out
for
his
chances
in
which
to
work
and
of
course
he
found
them
found
one
that
very
day
after
dinner
kitty
wandered
off
by
herself
tip
watched
her
and
she
took
the
road
leading
to
the
cemetery
god
put
it
into
his
heart
to
hurry
after
her
so
when
he
came
up
to
her
where
she
sat
on
a
large
stone
which
she
had
rolled
very
near
to
johnny
grave
his
heart
was
beating
at
the
thought
of
the
great
work
which
he
had
to
do
what
did
come
for
said
kitty
looking
up
tip
hesitated
a
minute
then
told
the
plain
truth
i
came
after
you
i
suppose
i
know
that
you
did
come
before
me
i
mean
i
came
to
you
well
look
at
me
then
and
go
off
i
do
want
you
here
clearly
whatever
was
to
be
said
must
be
said
quickly
and
tip
heart
was
very
full
of
its
message
so
his
voice
was
tender
oh
kitty
i
came
to
ask
you
if
you
be
a
christian
i
want
it
so
it
seems
as
if
i
could
wait
kitty
looked
steadily
and
gravely
at
her
brother
what
do
you
mean
by
a
christian
she
asked
at
last
i
mean
love
jesus
and
do
as
he
says
what
i
love
him
for
you
ca
help
it
when
you
find
out
how
much
he
loves
you
and
all
the
things
he
does
for
you
what
does
he
say
do
he
says
be
good
try
to
do
right
things
all
the
time
kitty
eyes
flashed
now
ai
you
mean
she
said
angrily
to
come
and
tell
me
such
things
when
you
know
i
ai
good
and
be
good
is
mother
ugly
and
cross
and
scolding
to
me
all
the
time
and
do
i
have
to
work
and
work
and
never
have
anything
and
i
cross
and
get
mad
and
i
too
i
ca
help
it
oh
but
kitty
tip
interrupted
eagerly
you
do
know
about
it
he
helps
you
jesus
does
when
anything
is
the
matter
when
you
feel
cross
and
bad
you
just
go
and
kneel
down
and
tell
him
all
about
it
and
he
helps
you
every
time
and
up
in
heaven
where
you
can
go
when
you
die
nobody
ever
gets
cross
and
scolds
and
it
beautiful
there
they
sing
and
have
fountains
and
wear
gold
crowns
and
and
johnny
is
there
you
know
and
i
going
and
i
want
you
to
come
along
kitty
face
had
been
growing
graver
and
graver
with
every
word
her
brother
spoke
and
when
at
last
he
stopped
with
his
eyes
turned
towards
johnny
little
grave
kitty
shawl
was
crumpled
up
in
her
two
hands
and
held
tightly
to
her
face
and
she
was
crying
not
softly
and
quietly
but
rocking
herself
back
and
forth
and
giving
way
to
great
sobs
which
shook
her
little
form
tip
looked
distressed
he
did
know
what
to
say
next
he
stooped
down
to
her
at
last
and
spoke
softly
oh
kitty
i
sorry
for
you
if
you
only
love
jesus
it
would
make
you
happy
i
want
to
i
want
to
sobbed
kitty
i
would
if
i
knew
how
tip
heart
gave
a
bound
of
joy
a
surprised
bound
too
he
had
not
expected
it
so
soon
it
easy
kitty
it
is
truly
if
you
only
just
ask
god
to
do
it
you
see
he
can
hear
every
word
you
say
he
hears
you
now
but
he
wants
you
to
ask
him
about
it
say
kitty
i
go
off
and
leave
you
i
go
where
i
ca
see
nor
hear
you
then
you
kneel
down
and
tell
jesus
about
it
and
he
help
you
stop
said
kitty
as
tip
was
turning
away
wait
i
do
know
what
to
say
why
just
him
just
as
you
did
me
and
ask
him
to
help
you
you
see
kitty
you
ca
do
a
thing
without
that
he
got
to
look
after
you
every
single
minute
or
it
nothing
at
all
tip
went
away
and
kitty
was
left
alone
alone
in
the
spot
where
her
brother
had
first
found
the
saviour
she
felt
very
strangely
she
had
been
left
there
alone
to
offer
her
first
prayer
kitty
had
never
been
taught
to
kneel
down
by
her
bedside
every
evening
and
repeat
our
father
it
was
all
new
and
strange
to
her
she
sat
still
a
long
time
with
the
sober
look
deepening
on
her
face
at
last
she
got
down
on
her
knees
and
rested
her
little
hard
hands
on
the
hard
snow
which
covered
johnny
bed
and
she
said
jesus
i
want
to
be
what
tip
says
i
want
to
love
you
if
you
let
me
nobody
loves
me
i
guess
tip
says
you
help
me
all
the
time
if
you
will
i
try
after
she
had
said
this
slowly
and
thoughtfully
stopping
long
between
each
sentence
she
did
feel
like
rising
up
she
wanted
to
say
more
so
she
repeated
it
adding
tip
says
i
must
be
good
i
ca
be
good
but
i
try
over
and
over
was
the
simple
earnest
prayer
repeated
tip
did
not
go
back
to
johnny
grave
he
took
a
side
road
down
through
the
edge
of
the
grove
and
so
went
home
and
when
he
reached
home
he
went
up
to
his
attic
room
and
knelt
down
and
prayed
for
kitty
as
only
those
pray
who
have
been
working
as
well
as
asking
for
what
they
want
kitty
was
stirring
the
pudding
for
supper
when
he
saw
her
again
stirring
away
hard
at
the
heavy
mass
which
grew
thicker
and
harder
to
stir
every
moment
he
went
over
to
her
kitty
let
me
do
this
and
she
gave
up
the
tip
stirred
away
by
and
by
she
leaned
over
the
kettle
to
put
in
some
salt
and
as
she
sprinkled
it
around
she
caught
his
eager
longing
look
she
nodded
her
head
i
guess
he
heard
she
said
softly
i
he
did
tip
answered
his
eyes
very
blight
in
his
heart
he
sang
and
the
angels
in
heaven
sang
for
joy
for
that
night
there
had
been
laid
aside
a
white
robe
and
a
crown
of
gold
for
kitty
lewis
chapter
xvi
whosoever
therefore
shall
confess
me
before
men
him
will
i
confess
also
before
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
tip
was
very
undecided
what
to
do
he
went
out
on
the
steps
and
looked
about
him
in
the
moonlight
then
he
came
in
and
took
a
long
look
out
of
the
window
at
last
the
question
whatever
it
was
seemed
to
be
settled
he
turned
with
a
resolute
air
to
kitty
who
was
washing
the
kitty
do
you
want
to
go
to
up
at
the
church
kitty
dropped
her
cup
back
into
the
and
stood
looking
at
him
a
good
deal
surprised
at
last
she
said
i
like
to
tip
but
i
do
look
decent
to
go
anywhere
i
only
this
dress
and
my
old
hood
i
would
mind
that
said
tip
i
only
this
awful
old
jacket
either
but
i
mean
to
go
hurry
up
the
dishes
and
let
go
well
said
kitty
at
last
i
but
what
will
mother
say
i
fix
that
and
tip
stepped
softly
into
the
bedroom
are
you
better
father
not
much
better
i
guess
how
arithmetic
burrows
said
i
was
getting
ahead
fast
mother
may
kitty
go
out
with
me
i
going
up
to
the
church
to
lewis
turned
from
the
basket
where
she
had
been
hunting
long
and
as
yet
in
vain
for
a
piece
of
flannel
and
bent
a
searching
bewildered
look
on
her
son
i
do
care
she
said
at
last
she
can
go
if
she
likes
but
i
doubt
if
she
will
she
however
in
ten
minutes
more
the
two
were
walking
along
the
snowy
path
kitty
was
sober
tip
she
said
presently
do
you
never
get
real
awful
so
mad
that
you
feel
as
if
you
choke
if
you
could
speak
right
out
at
somebody
well
no
said
tip
not
often
yes
i
do
too
i
get
mad
at
bob
turner
sometimes
mad
enough
to
pitch
him
into
a
but
it
do
last
long
well
mine
does
said
kitty
i
begin
in
the
morning
something
makes
me
cross
and
i
keep
on
getting
crosser
and
crosser
every
minute
till
it
seems
as
if
i
should
fly
do
you
suppose
i
always
do
just
so
no
answered
tip
positively
i
you
keep
on
trying
a
little
bit
harder
every
day
and
by
and
by
you
find
that
you
do
get
cross
more
than
half
as
easy
as
you
used
to
i
know
it
will
be
so
because
i
tried
it
in
other
things
when
i
first
began
to
behave
myself
in
school
it
was
the
work
my
you
can
think
how
i
wanted
to
whisper
and
things
kept
happening
all
the
time
to
make
me
laugh
but
i
just
kept
trying
and
now
i
hardly
ever
think
of
whispering
kitty
does
mother
know
no
said
kitty
she
do
if
i
were
you
i
tell
her
oh
tip
i
ca
she
never
looks
at
me
without
scolding
me
i
talk
to
her
about
this
yes
you
can
i
surely
do
it
if
i
were
you
it
will
be
a
great
deal
easier
to
try
hard
if
mother
knows
you
are
trying
they
were
almost
at
the
church
door
kitty
said
tip
suddenly
let
pray
for
father
i
been
praying
for
him
this
long
time
you
help
me
step
by
step
god
was
leading
tip
lewis
in
the
narrow
way
no
sooner
was
he
seated
in
the
bright
warm
little
room
and
had
listened
to
holbrook
earnest
prayer
that
every
christian
there
might
do
something
for
christ
that
night
than
the
struggle
began
what
ought
he
to
do
for
christ
people
all
around
him
were
one
after
another
offering
prayer
or
saying
a
few
words
ought
he
to
could
he
oh
he
could
who
would
want
to
listen
to
him
it
would
do
any
good
there
was
burrows
right
in
front
of
him
he
would
be
ashamed
of
him
perhaps
yes
but
then
ought
he
not
to
own
his
saviour
holbrook
had
spoken
of
the
verse
whosoever
will
deny
me
before
men
and
had
made
the
meaning
very
plain
minturn
had
just
prayed
that
no
one
there
might
be
ashamed
of
christ
the
end
of
it
all
was
that
tip
slipped
off
his
seat
down
on
his
knees
and
said
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
show
me
how
to
pray
i
do
want
to
deny
christ
i
want
to
love
him
i
want
the
boys
in
our
school
and
my
father
and
everybody
to
love
him
i
try
to
work
for
jesus
i
try
to
work
for
him
help
me
every
day
and
forgive
my
sins
for
jesus
sake
amen
tip
had
never
felt
so
near
to
god
as
he
did
when
he
arose
from
his
knees
holbrook
voice
trembled
with
feeling
when
soon
after
he
prayed
for
the
young
disciple
who
had
early
taken
up
his
cross
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
the
minister
pressed
his
way
through
the
little
company
of
people
who
were
waiting
to
speak
with
him
good
evening
all
he
said
hurriedly
excuse
me
brother
to
minturn
who
would
have
stopped
him
any
way
i
want
to
speak
to
some
people
before
they
get
away
from
me
and
those
who
watched
saw
him
hurry
on
until
he
overtook
tip
lewis
and
his
sister
good
evening
edward
this
is
kitty
i
think
how
do
you
do
my
little
girl
edward
do
you
know
such
a
bible
verse
as
this
love
the
lord
because
he
has
heard
my
voice
and
my
supplication
no
sir
answered
tip
eagerly
there
such
a
verse
yes
somewhere
in
the
psalms
you
will
find
it
i
do
remember
just
where
can
you
feel
the
truth
of
it
when
you
think
of
your
sister
yes
sir
i
god
hear
me
and
you
think
you
love
jesus
kitty
kitty
felt
a
great
awe
for
the
minister
and
her
yes
sir
was
low
and
spoken
in
a
timid
voice
what
makes
you
think
so
i
i
do
know
only
i
pray
and
he
hears
me
and
i
like
to
well
now
kitty
almost
the
first
thing
which
people
think
of
after
they
have
found
jesus
is
something
to
do
for
him
they
begin
to
look
around
to
see
what
they
can
find
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
do
know
sir
i
have
got
anything
i
can
do
ah
that
a
mistake
you
can
find
plenty
of
work
if
you
look
for
it
only
do
look
too
far
because
it
is
the
little
bits
of
things
which
come
right
in
your
way
that
jesus
wants
you
to
do
when
you
brush
up
the
room
and
set
the
table
neatly
and
brighten
the
fire
and
do
little
thoughtful
things
that
help
your
mother
then
you
are
pleasing
jesus
doing
work
for
him
is
it
pleasant
to
think
that
in
all
those
little
things
he
is
watching
over
you
and
that
you
make
him
glad
when
you
do
them
well
do
you
know
that
one
of
god
commands
is
thy
father
and
thy
mother
no
said
kitty
softly
it
is
those
are
the
very
words
edward
can
find
them
for
you
in
the
bible
and
honour
means
more
than
obey
it
means
try
to
please
them
in
the
very
smallest
things
they
were
very
near
the
corner
where
holbrook
must
leave
them
he
laid
his
hand
gently
on
tip
shoulder
as
he
said
speaking
of
bible
verses
edward
i
have
one
for
you
this
evening
in
the
saviour
own
words
shall
confess
me
before
men
him
will
i
also
confess
before
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
tip
understood
him
and
there
was
a
bright
look
in
his
eyes
the
two
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
little
presently
kitty
said
i
guess
holbrook
do
know
just
how
mother
is
or
he
would
talk
so
yes
but
said
tip
quickly
god
knew
all
about
it
always
you
know
and
yet
he
said
that
verse
so
he
did
answered
kitty
gravely
chapter
xvii
behold
how
great
a
matter
a
little
fire
kindleth
bah
said
will
bailey
you
fooling
howard
minturn
as
true
as
i
live
i
not
answered
howard
earnestly
you
can
ask
mr
burrows
what
up
inquired
ellis
holbrook
joining
the
two
why
howard
is
telling
the
biggest
yarn
you
ever
heard
he
says
tip
lewis
went
to
last
night
and
made
a
prayer
tip
lewis
and
ellis
holbrook
voice
was
full
not
only
of
surprise
but
scorn
i
should
like
to
hear
him
well
it
true
repeated
howard
my
father
told
us
about
it
this
morning
and
he
said
it
was
a
good
prayer
too
he
said
ellis
that
your
father
could
keep
the
tears
out
of
his
eyes
when
he
heard
him
and
burrows
walked
up
town
with
father
and
told
him
that
tip
had
changed
wonderfully
that
he
was
one
of
the
best
boys
in
school
well
said
will
bailey
if
tip
lewis
has
turned
saint
i
give
up
why
he
the
meanest
scamp
in
town
my
father
says
he
had
enough
for
anything
oh
well
now
answered
ellis
there
no
use
in
being
stupid
enough
not
to
see
that
what
burrows
says
is
true
i
never
saw
any
one
change
as
he
has
in
my
life
but
i
be
hanged
if
i
like
him
as
well
as
i
did
before
he
was
so
awful
good
he
too
nice
for
anything
especially
when
he
trips
the
minister
son
up
about
twisting
the
bible
ellis
face
glowed
but
he
was
an
honest
boy
he
was
right
enough
about
that
he
said
promptly
my
father
says
it
wrong
but
if
it
will
do
you
any
good
to
know
it
i
have
liked
tip
so
well
since
say
tip
said
will
bailey
hailing
him
at
recess
come
here
and
give
an
account
of
yourself
they
say
you
turned
parson
last
night
did
you
no
said
tip
with
the
greatest
good
humour
i
did
did
you
speak
in
meeting
a
quiet
gravity
spread
itself
over
tip
face
i
prayed
in
meeting
he
answered
soberly
oh
well
what
did
you
pray
for
come
let
know
i
prayed
for
tip
spoke
with
quiet
dignity
humph
now
that
clever
certainly
much
obliged
and
will
said
no
more
certainly
the
boys
had
never
talked
so
much
about
any
in
their
lives
as
they
did
about
this
one
so
that
was
the
way
it
commenced
such
a
little
fire
kindled
it
tip
did
know
it
he
never
found
it
out
probably
he
never
will
until
he
takes
his
crown
in
heaven
from
the
humble
little
prayer
which
tip
had
offered
sprang
the
first
buddings
of
the
great
revival
which
god
sent
down
to
them
say
said
howard
minturn
to
ellis
on
the
next
thursday
evening
go
over
to
i
really
am
dreadfully
anxious
to
hear
tip
speak
no
answered
ellis
speaking
hastily
more
hastily
than
he
often
did
to
howard
i
sure
i
do
care
in
the
least
to
hear
him
and
i
have
enough
to
do
without
going
there
howard
was
to
go
and
to
find
company
will
let
go
to
meeting
he
said
the
next
time
he
came
across
will
bailey
will
looked
at
him
in
amazement
what
for
to
hear
tip
oh
said
will
good
i
go
let
get
a
lot
of
the
boys
and
go
over
just
to
encourage
him
you
know
and
they
went
tip
and
kitty
were
there
again
and
again
with
tip
the
struggle
had
to
be
gone
through
his
coward
spirit
whispered
to
him
that
the
boys
would
only
make
fun
of
him
if
he
said
a
word
and
it
would
do
more
harm
than
good
his
conscience
answered
whosoever
will
deny
me
on
earth
him
will
i
also
deny
before
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
the
solemn
words
conquered
and
again
tip
knelt
down
and
prayed
my
said
minturn
talking
with
his
wife
after
they
reached
home
when
i
thought
of
the
bringing
up
which
that
boy
has
had
no
bringing
up
about
it
he
has
just
up
the
easiest
way
he
could
but
when
i
heard
him
pray
and
then
thought
of
our
boy
who
has
been
prayed
for
and
watched
over
every
day
since
he
was
born
i
declare
i
felt
as
though
i
would
give
all
i
worth
to
have
howard
stand
where
tip
lewis
does
now
howard
heard
this
as
he
waited
in
the
for
his
father
and
mother
heard
it
in
great
amazement
and
at
first
it
made
him
indignant
the
idea
of
comparing
with
tip
lewis
then
it
made
him
sorrowful
his
father
tones
were
sad
after
all
that
had
been
done
for
him
it
hard
that
he
should
disappoint
his
parents
he
listened
to
his
father
prayer
that
night
very
closely
and
its
earnestness
brought
the
tears
to
his
eyes
altogether
howard
went
to
school
the
next
morning
with
a
somewhat
sober
face
and
took
no
part
whatever
in
the
boys
fun
over
the
meeting
burrows
heart
had
been
warmed
by
the
voice
of
prayer
from
one
of
his
scholars
and
he
began
to
pray
and
long
for
others
of
them
to
work
also
and
the
great
god
who
knows
the
beginning
and
the
end
led
his
first
words
of
anxiety
to
howard
minturn
they
stood
at
the
desk
teacher
and
scholar
howard
bending
over
his
slate
ca
you
get
it
burrows
asked
no
sir
howard
are
you
working
with
all
your
thoughts
no
sir
and
a
bright
flush
mounted
to
his
forehead
what
is
it
howard
i
do
know
sir
not
much
of
anything
i
guess
are
you
not
quite
satisfied
with
yourself
satisfied
i
why
i
do
know
what
you
mean
sir
i
have
tried
to
do
the
best
i
could
i
believe
do
you
really
think
so
howard
yes
sir
did
you
think
so
last
evening
in
the
can
a
boy
who
is
as
well
taught
as
you
have
been
feel
that
he
is
doing
as
well
as
he
can
when
he
knows
that
he
is
every
day
cheating
god
howard
face
fairly
burned
i
do
understand
you
sir
do
you
and
burrows
voice
was
very
kind
i
wish
that
god
own
spirit
might
help
you
to
understand
it
did
your
father
and
mother
promise
god
when
you
were
born
to
try
to
train
you
up
for
him
because
you
belonged
to
him
and
they
knew
it
now
have
they
done
their
duty
is
it
their
fault
that
you
are
not
a
christian
no
sir
then
it
comes
back
to
you
you
belong
to
god
body
and
soul
he
made
you
he
has
kept
you
he
would
save
you
only
you
will
not
let
him
you
ca
help
the
fact
that
you
belong
to
him
all
you
can
do
is
to
refuse
to
give
him
your
love
and
let
him
lead
you
to
heaven
and
this
you
are
doing
is
it
right
howard
was
growing
haughty
i
do
feel
the
need
of
any
such
things
burrows
he
answered
coldly
suppose
you
do
does
that
help
the
matter
any
does
it
change
the
fact
that
you
belong
to
god
that
you
are
cheating
him
out
of
his
own
property
the
question
i
ask
is
are
you
doing
right
howard
stood
with
eyes
fixed
on
his
slate
saying
nothing
wo
you
answer
me
howard
burrows
asked
gently
is
it
right
and
after
a
long
long
silence
the
boy
honest
earnest
eyes
were
raised
to
his
teacher
face
and
he
spoke
steadily
no
sir
are
you
willing
to
go
on
doing
wrong
no
sir
will
you
turn
howard
and
start
right
now
came
another
long
silence
howard
minturn
the
honest
faithful
boy
always
getting
a
little
nearer
right
than
any
of
the
others
had
been
condemned
by
his
own
words
and
knew
not
what
to
say
at
last
he
spoke
i
ca
promise
mr
burrows
howard
such
an
answer
from
to
whom
i
have
only
needed
to
point
out
what
was
right
in
order
to
have
it
done
but
i
ca
trust
myself
sir
i
shall
not
feel
as
i
do
now
that
is
you
feel
like
doing
your
duty
today
but
you
expect
if
you
wait
until
that
you
will
feel
less
like
it
so
you
mean
to
wait
is
that
right
the
silence
was
much
longer
this
time
so
long
that
the
boys
began
to
look
curiously
at
the
two
figures
over
by
the
desk
and
wonder
why
the
bell
was
not
rung
but
at
last
he
raised
those
clear
truthful
eyes
once
more
burrows
i
try
and
the
next
thursday
evening
when
in
the
house
of
prayer
it
was
very
still
because
holbrook
had
just
said
is
there
not
here
who
wants
us
to
pray
for
him
and
if
there
is
will
he
not
let
us
know
it
suddenly
there
was
a
row
of
astonished
faces
in
the
seat
where
the
schoolboys
were
sitting
because
from
among
them
arose
howard
minturn
and
his
face
was
pale
and
grave
and
his
voice
was
steady
they
all
heard
his
words
i
want
to
be
a
christian
will
you
pray
for
me
oh
would
they
was
there
ever
such
another
prayer
as
that
which
minturn
offered
for
his
son
did
any
one
who
heard
it
wonder
that
such
prayer
was
answered
and
that
in
the
next
meeting
howard
speaking
with
a
little
ring
of
joy
in
his
voice
said
i
love
jesus
i
want
every
one
to
love
him
i
am
very
happy
from
this
the
work
went
on
the
little
grew
full
and
overflowed
and
the
crowd
now
filled
the
church
and
every
night
some
new
voice
was
heard
asking
for
prayer
will
bailey
seemed
filled
with
the
spirit
of
torment
teased
the
boys
unmercifully
went
to
the
meeting
every
evening
and
made
fun
of
it
all
day
but
the
boys
were
praying
for
him
and
god
pitying
eye
was
on
him
one
evening
there
were
two
who
arose
to
ask
the
prayers
of
christians
one
was
will
bailey
the
most
hopeless
so
the
boys
thought
of
all
the
boys
in
town
the
other
was
will
bailey
father
the
most
hopeless
so
the
good
men
feared
of
all
the
strong
men
in
town
yet
there
were
two
for
whom
daily
earnest
prayer
was
offered
who
in
this
blessed
time
held
themselves
aloof
two
boys
so
far
separated
that
it
seems
strange
and
sad
that
their
names
should
be
coupled
just
here
bob
turner
and
ellis
holbrook
the
lowest
and
the
highest
the
worst
boy
in
school
and
the
best
yet
they
were
united
in
this
one
thing
that
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
christ
tip
had
prayed
for
both
worked
for
both
but
this
was
his
success
one
afternoon
say
bob
wo
you
go
to
meeting
just
to
please
me
could
tip
no
way
in
the
world
i
do
most
anything
to
please
you
too
for
the
sake
of
old
times
when
we
used
to
steal
apples
together
but
i
promised
to
go
with
nick
hunt
tonight
and
tie
old
barlow
cat
fast
to
his
frontdoor
knob
and
that
got
to
be
done
while
the
old
man
is
at
meeting
you
know
no
matter
either
about
my
going
you
just
do
the
praying
for
you
and
me
too
then
it
will
be
all
right
tip
turned
away
with
a
sigh
and
a
shudder
could
it
be
possible
that
boy
had
ever
been
his
only
companion
ellis
was
round
by
the
and
he
went
thither
ellis
wo
you
go
down
with
the
boys
it
almost
the
last
meeting
you
know
ellis
wheeled
around
and
spoke
in
his
coldest
tone
tip
lewis
you
seem
to
take
a
wonderful
interest
in
me
and
i
sure
much
obliged
to
you
but
i
be
a
great
deal
more
so
if
you
attend
to
your
own
affairs
after
this
and
let
mine
alone
poor
tip
how
discouraged
he
felt
yet
that
very
evening
going
home
from
school
he
met
holbrook
the
minister
turned
and
walked
up
town
with
him
edward
he
said
are
you
praying
for
my
boy
yes
sir
will
you
never
stop
praying
for
him
while
you
live
until
he
comes
to
christ
i
never
sir
answered
tip
with
energy
chapter
xviii
thy
father
and
thy
mother
shall
be
glad
and
she
that
bore
thee
shall
rejoice
how
did
holbrook
know
so
well
what
kitty
needed
to
help
her
his
words
had
given
her
such
new
thoughts
some
way
it
was
all
new
to
her
the
idea
that
she
had
any
duty
to
perform
towards
her
mother
she
stood
thinking
of
it
that
bright
winter
day
stood
before
the
little
fire
and
wondered
how
it
was
that
she
ought
to
commence
she
was
to
be
alone
all
day
stebbens
their
next
neighbour
had
fallen
down
and
sprained
her
ankle
and
sent
to
know
if
lewis
could
do
her
promised
work
in
the
village
kitty
was
left
in
charge
of
the
house
and
her
sick
father
she
looked
around
the
room
what
an
ugly
dreary
little
room
it
was
dust
dirt
and
cobwebs
everywhere
her
hood
and
shawl
lying
in
one
corner
her
mother
apron
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
breakfast
dishes
not
yet
washed
the
stove
all
spattered
with
grease
from
the
pork
gravy
the
hearth
thickly
covered
with
ashes
the
paper
hanging
by
one
tack
and
on
the
mantelpiece
behind
the
stove
such
an
array
of
apples
matches
forks
sticky
spoons
broken
teacups
and
dirty
candlesticks
as
would
have
frightened
any
one
less
used
to
it
than
was
kitty
as
she
looked
around
her
a
forlorn
smile
came
over
her
face
for
she
thought
of
holbrook
words
when
you
brush
up
the
floor
or
brighten
the
fire
to
please
your
mother
he
do
know
she
said
to
herself
that
mother
do
care
for
sweeping
and
such
things
he
do
know
how
we
live
i
wonder
if
mother
notice
now
if
things
were
different
what
if
we
did
live
like
other
folks
had
nice
tilings
and
kept
them
put
up
and
the
room
swept
suppose
i
try
it
what
could
i
do
i
might
sweep
and
wash
off
the
stove
and
and
clean
off
the
mantelpiece
i
just
do
it
and
see
if
anybody
in
this
house
will
care
no
sooner
thought
than
commenced
kitty
went
to
work
the
dishes
were
washed
until
they
shone
those
clean
dishes
should
go
in
such
a
disorderly
cupboard
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
shelves
must
be
washed
down
came
the
bottles
and
bundles
papers
of
this
and
boxes
of
that
which
had
been
gathering
kitty
did
know
how
long
and
the
astonished
shelves
felt
soap
and
water
once
more
how
they
were
scrubbed
kitty
called
her
father
from
his
bedroom
hearing
the
racket
what
are
you
doing
i
cleaning
house
answered
kitty
promptly
and
her
father
because
he
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
let
her
work
from
the
cupboard
she
went
to
the
mantelpiece
bundled
the
things
all
off
in
a
heap
washed
it
thoroughly
and
put
everything
in
order
what
a
day
it
was
to
kitty
one
improvement
led
to
another
and
as
things
began
to
grow
clean
in
her
hands
she
grew
wonderfully
interested
and
only
stopped
at
noon
to
warm
her
father
gruel
it
was
saturday
and
tip
had
gone
to
pile
wood
for
bailey
he
was
to
get
his
dinner
and
a
grammar
for
his
pay
he
had
wanted
a
grammar
all
winter
so
he
worked
with
a
will
and
kitty
saw
neither
him
nor
her
mother
through
all
the
busy
day
the
early
sun
had
set
long
before
kitty
thought
he
certainly
would
not
know
that
room
the
next
morning
it
was
all
so
changed
the
paper
curtain
was
mended
and
tacked
up
in
its
place
the
old
lounge
cover
was
mended
and
fastened
on
smoothly
the
mantelpiece
shone
and
glowed
in
the
firelight
the
two
shiny
candlesticks
and
beside
them
the
little
box
of
matches
were
all
that
remained
there
of
the
rubbish
of
the
morning
the
floor
was
just
as
smooth
and
clean
as
soap
and
ashes
with
plenty
of
hot
water
and
an
old
broom
could
make
it
hoods
and
shawls
and
aprons
and
old
shoes
had
all
disappeared
nothing
was
lying
around
the
table
was
drawn
out
the
clean
smooth
plates
arranged
so
as
to
hide
the
soiled
spots
on
the
tablecloth
the
pudding
was
bubbling
away
in
the
astonished
kettle
and
kitty
joy
had
been
complete
when
only
a
few
minutes
before
after
a
great
deal
of
stamping
and
pounding
she
had
opened
the
door
to
howard
minturn
who
said
mother
sent
you
some
milk
for
your
where
tip
it
cold
though
there
be
prime
skating
give
me
the
pitcher
right
away
please
all
this
in
one
breath
now
they
would
have
beautiful
fresh
milk
for
supper
and
if
there
was
anything
which
tip
liked
it
was
pudding
and
milk
so
kitty
set
the
old
in
the
warmest
corner
for
her
mother
fastened
her
father
door
wide
open
so
that
he
could
see
the
new
room
then
stirred
her
pudding
and
watched
and
waited
her
mother
came
first
kitty
heart
had
never
beat
more
anxiously
than
when
she
heard
the
slow
tired
step
on
the
hard
snow
would
she
notice
anything
different
in
she
came
tired
cross
and
cold
expecting
to
find
disorder
discomfort
and
cold
inside
could
anybody
having
eyes
fail
to
notice
the
changes
which
had
been
wrought
in
that
little
room
since
she
went
out
from
it
in
the
early
morning
she
shut
the
door
with
a
little
slam
and
then
the
flush
of
the
firelight
seemed
to
blind
her
a
little
she
brushed
her
hand
over
her
face
and
looked
around
her
with
a
bewildered
air
kitty
went
over
to
her
some
way
she
felt
a
great
kindness
in
her
heart
for
her
mother
a
great
longing
to
do
something
for
her
is
it
cold
mother
she
asked
brightly
take
that
chair
pointing
to
the
seat
in
the
warm
corner
supper
all
ready
and
i
made
a
cup
of
tea
for
you
lewis
took
off
her
hood
and
shawl
in
silence
untied
her
wet
shoes
and
placed
her
cold
feet
on
the
clean
warm
took
in
the
brightness
of
the
room
the
shiny
candlesticks
the
took
whiffs
of
the
steaming
tea
all
in
utter
silence
only
when
kitty
father
looking
out
said
there
been
business
done
here
since
you
went
away
something
in
her
mother
voice
as
she
answered
i
should
think
there
had
made
the
blood
rush
warmly
into
cheeks
and
made
her
whisper
to
herself
as
she
stooped
to
place
the
wet
shoes
under
the
stove
to
dry
holbrook
told
me
true
i
do
believe
i
guess
i
have
pleased
jesus
i
feel
so
while
she
was
taking
up
the
pudding
there
was
a
merry
whistle
outside
a
brisk
crushing
step
on
the
snow
and
tip
whizzed
into
the
room
oh
there
was
no
mistaking
the
look
of
delight
on
his
face
nor
the
glad
ring
in
his
voice
as
he
said
oh
kitty
why
kitty
lewis
what
you
been
doing
why
it
looks
almost
as
nice
here
as
it
does
at
howard
minturn
all
that
evening
there
seemed
a
spell
upon
the
lewis
family
lewis
did
say
one
cross
or
fretful
word
indeed
she
had
no
cause
for
in
kitty
heart
there
was
a
strange
new
feeling
of
love
for
her
mother
of
longing
to
please
and
give
her
comfort
and
never
was
mother
waited
on
with
a
more
quiet
care
than
lewis
received
that
night
this
was
the
first
coming
of
to
the
family
tip
had
apples
in
his
pocket
which
howard
minturn
had
given
him
he
roasted
them
before
the
fire
and
his
father
ate
very
little
pieces
of
them
and
his
mother
darned
stockings
by
the
light
of
the
candle
in
the
clean
little
candlestick
set
on
the
clean
little
stand
and
they
were
happy
by
and
by
tip
brought
out
his
grammar
and
finding
kitty
very
much
interested
in
examining
it
said
what
if
you
should
begin
and
study
grammar
with
me
what
if
i
should
answered
kitty
so
that
evening
she
commenced
her
education
and
though
grammar
was
a
queer
study
to
with
still
it
was
a
beginning
the
pleasant
evening
wore
away
the
town
clock
had
struck
nine
father
had
gone
quietly
to
sleep
and
the
bedroom
door
was
shut
to
keep
all
sounds
from
disturbing
him
tip
had
taken
his
candle
and
gone
lewis
sat
toasting
her
feet
before
the
dying
fire
yet
still
kitty
lingered
she
wanted
to
take
tip
advice
and
tell
her
mother
about
her
dear
new
friend
and
this
evening
of
such
wonderful
peace
seemed
the
good
time
for
doing
so
but
she
did
know
how
if
her
mother
would
only
say
something
to
help
her
and
presently
she
did
kitty
what
fit
came
over
you
to
go
to
work
and
clear
up
at
such
rate
i
wanted
to
please
i
guess
kitty
knew
that
this
answer
would
surprise
her
mother
and
it
did
into
utter
silence
but
after
what
seemed
to
kitty
a
long
time
she
spoke
again
what
did
you
want
to
do
that
for
now
for
it
this
was
the
best
chance
she
could
ever
hope
to
have
and
her
voice
trembled
a
little
i
wanted
to
please
jesus
too
mother
and
holbrook
said
if
i
did
things
to
help
you
and
that
you
would
like
would
be
glad
would
you
know
a
little
silence
and
then
i
want
to
please
jesus
all
the
time
now
because
i
love
him
and
i
going
to
try
to
do
right
it
was
all
out
now
and
her
heart
was
beating
so
that
it
almost
stopped
her
voice
her
mother
shaded
her
face
with
her
hand
and
neither
spoke
nor
moved
kitty
waited
a
little
then
moved
slowly
towards
the
door
of
her
bit
of
a
bedroom
it
was
moonlight
so
she
needed
no
candle
mother
she
found
courage
to
say
at
last
and
her
mother
voice
sounded
strangely
coming
from
behind
the
hand
there
was
something
like
a
great
sob
in
kitty
throat
as
she
went
to
her
room
that
night
in
her
heart
was
a
great
longing
for
she
would
have
liked
to
kiss
her
mother
but
she
felt
how
queerly
that
would
look
even
to
was
something
very
unusual
so
she
knelt
down
beside
her
bed
and
prayed
for
her
mother
i
do
think
holbrook
knew
that
the
few
kind
words
which
he
spoke
to
kitty
lewis
on
her
way
home
from
were
seeds
which
were
going
to
spring
up
and
bear
fruit
unto
everlasting
life
chapter
xix
and
all
thy
children
shall
be
taught
of
the
lord
father
said
tip
as
after
having
carefully
measured
out
and
given
him
some
he
sat
down
for
a
chat
with
him
before
school
father
did
you
and
bailey
go
to
school
together
when
you
were
boys
yes
said
lewis
our
fathers
lived
side
by
side
and
we
used
to
walk
more
than
a
mile
to
school
together
every
morning
we
were
in
the
same
class
too
and
the
best
scholars
in
school
my
times
are
changed
since
that
day
my
father
was
considerably
better
off
than
his
was
and
now
he
a
rich
man
and
i
nobody
was
he
such
a
boy
as
will
bailey
is
or
i
mean
as
will
used
to
be
i
do
know
much
about
will
but
i
know
his
father
was
a
sorry
scamp
and
many
the
scrape
he
got
me
into
he
took
a
notion
to
me
we
lived
near
by
and
were
always
together
and
then
i
was
as
full
of
pranks
as
he
was
i
suppose
but
he
was
a
regular
tyrant
over
the
rest
of
the
boys
they
were
more
than
half
afraid
of
him
i
do
know
but
what
i
was
myself
anyhow
i
know
i
thought
i
have
been
different
maybe
if
i
had
followed
him
so
close
in
all
his
scrapes
father
did
you
know
bailey
was
different
now
different
how
what
do
you
mean
why
he
comes
to
and
speaks
and
prays
and
seems
to
love
to
the
mischief
he
does
said
lewis
surprised
out
of
his
usual
quiet
tone
i
should
think
he
different
why
he
used
to
make
great
fun
of
all
such
things
yes
that
what
he
says
but
i
tell
you
he
do
make
fun
now
when
did
all
that
happen
a
few
weeks
ago
when
the
revival
was
you
know
he
got
up
one
night
and
asked
them
to
pray
for
him
and
now
he
almost
always
speaks
or
prays
in
the
meetings
well
said
lewis
after
a
pause
and
with
a
little
sigh
sure
i
ai
sorry
i
only
hope
it
will
last
he
needed
it
as
bad
as
any
one
i
know
of
it
will
last
tip
said
speaking
positively
god
will
look
out
for
that
then
he
waited
a
little
before
he
spoke
again
but
he
had
been
praying
for
his
father
long
enough
and
earnestly
enough
to
feel
bold
i
thought
last
night
that
you
must
have
been
pretty
good
friends
once
he
said
presently
for
he
most
broke
down
when
he
was
praying
for
you
and
the
tears
just
blinded
him
lewis
turned
himself
on
his
pillow
and
looked
steadily
at
his
son
did
bailey
pray
for
he
asked
at
last
yes
he
did
and
he
prayed
as
if
he
meant
it
how
came
he
to
why
i
asked
to
all
the
folks
in
meeting
you
know
i
wanted
you
to
be
a
christian
and
prayed
for
you
and
then
i
asked
them
if
they
pray
and
bailey
got
right
up
you
do
mind
that
do
you
father
all
the
folks
down
there
ask
us
to
pray
for
their
friends
answered
lewis
at
last
speaking
slowly
i
do
know
that
i
do
i
need
praying
for
i
suppose
if
anybody
does
i
going
where
i
ca
be
prayed
for
pretty
fast
i
guess
tip
had
no
answer
to
make
to
that
so
you
prayed
for
me
too
did
you
his
father
asked
presently
yes
and
i
do
every
day
father
i
want
you
to
know
jesus
a
long
silence
followed
and
then
the
sick
man
spoke
again
well
tip
i
glad
that
you
got
right
gladder
than
i
can
tell
you
my
father
was
a
good
man
and
tried
to
make
me
do
what
was
right
but
i
went
all
wrong
wasted
my
whole
life
and
brought
up
my
children
to
do
so
too
but
you
getting
on
without
my
help
and
i
glad
you
grow
up
to
be
a
good
man
and
be
a
comfort
to
your
mother
when
i
gone
but
i
do
know
that
you
need
ask
folks
to
pray
for
me
it
too
late
gone
too
far
to
get
back
tip
bold
prompt
manner
did
not
forsake
him
now
he
answered
quickly
father
i
do
believe
any
such
thing
god
does
say
anything
about
it
being
too
late
and
he
says
if
we
want
anything
very
much
and
pray
for
it
and
it
good
to
have
he
give
it
to
us
and
i
bound
to
believe
him
once
i
prayed
for
kitty
and
prayed
and
prayed
and
it
did
do
a
bit
of
good
until
at
last
holbrook
told
me
that
maybe
it
was
because
i
did
really
believe
any
of
the
time
that
god
was
going
to
do
what
i
wanted
him
to
and
i
found
out
that
was
it
just
as
soon
as
i
began
to
think
he
would
hear
me
it
all
came
out
straight
and
now
bound
to
believe
him
every
time
i
asked
him
to
make
you
a
christian
and
i
going
to
keep
on
asking
and
do
father
tip
voice
took
a
softer
tone
for
he
knew
there
was
one
very
tender
spot
in
his
father
heart
do
you
want
to
see
little
johnny
up
in
heaven
the
muscles
around
lewis
mouth
began
to
twitch
nervously
and
a
tear
rolled
down
his
cheek
i
pretty
near
it
he
said
at
last
and
i
think
sometimes
i
give
the
world
if
i
had
it
to
be
ready
to
go
but
it
all
too
late
known
the
right
way
all
my
life
and
i
gone
the
other
way
now
i
must
just
take
my
pay
the
very
spirit
of
christ
must
have
shown
tip
what
to
say
next
he
spoke
the
words
earnestly
and
solemnly
he
meant
no
disrespect
father
do
you
know
more
about
it
than
god
because
you
see
it
say
any
such
thing
anywhere
in
the
bible
i
know
it
do
for
we
talked
about
it
in
sunday
school
once
and
holbrook
said
matter
how
old
a
man
was
nor
what
he
had
done
he
could
be
a
christian
i
always
thought
it
looked
mean
and
sneaking
in
a
man
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
things
all
his
life
and
then
turn
around
just
because
he
was
going
to
die
and
pretend
to
be
very
good
god
ca
be
pleased
with
any
such
thing
as
i
always
said
that
i
never
do
it
tip
could
answer
this
it
did
sound
true
he
felt
sure
it
was
not
true
but
he
had
no
wisdom
with
which
to
meet
it
he
went
to
school
with
those
last
words
of
his
father
ringing
in
his
heart
and
his
thoughts
took
shape
and
spoke
in
the
very
first
sentence
that
he
addressed
to
holbrook
whom
he
overtook
as
he
came
out
of
the
post
office
holbrook
can
i
ask
you
a
question
and
the
minister
always
ready
to
help
any
one
out
of
trouble
smiled
and
bowed
and
walked
on
by
the
side
of
the
troubled
boy
if
a
man
should
tell
you
he
thought
it
would
be
mean
in
him
to
turn
around
and
go
to
serving
god
after
he
had
found
out
he
had
but
a
little
while
to
live
when
he
had
cheated
him
out
of
all
the
rest
of
his
life
what
would
you
say
i
think
said
holbrook
i
would
be
very
likely
to
ask
him
whether
he
supposed
he
would
feel
any
less
mean
for
cheating
god
out
of
the
last
year
of
his
life
simply
because
he
had
been
doing
so
all
the
other
years
because
a
man
has
been
doing
wrong
for
forty
years
i
do
know
why
he
should
add
another
year
of
wrong
i
should
think
he
might
much
better
turn
around
and
make
all
the
amends
he
could
oh
said
tip
drawing
a
long
breath
why
could
i
have
thought
of
that
i
knew
it
was
wrong
i
saw
it
plain
enough
but
i
could
think
of
a
word
to
say
holbrook
looked
earnestly
at
the
eager
boy
edward
he
said
at
last
do
you
think
your
father
would
see
me
this
morning
yes
said
tip
decidedly
i
know
he
would
if
you
would
only
go
and
see
him
holbrook
and
explain
that
to
him
i
would
be
glad
and
looking
back
soon
after
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
holbrook
walk
quickly
down
town
in
the
direction
of
his
home
and
now
tip
felt
hopeful
for
his
father
he
had
prayed
for
him
he
had
worked
for
him
and
now
holbrook
had
gone
to
him
surely
he
could
leave
the
rest
in
god
hands
chapter
xx
let
him
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
fall
here

said
howard
minturn

this
frame
steady
while
i
try
that
nail

that
one
up
so
high

hold
of
this
stool
it
tipping
there

it
all
nice
and
in
order

mr
burrows
and
he
sprang
from
his
stool
as
their
teacher
entered
the
schoolroom
door
very
likely
answered
burrows
smiling
only
i
did
hear
what
you
said

say

for

all
the
room

i
hope

that
chair
a
little
to
the
left
it
will
be
in
the
way
of
the
classes
as
it
stands
now
do
you
feel
brave
edward
yes
sir
answered
tip
promptly
pretty
brave
and
he
did
besides
feeling
eager
and
excited
the
long
winter
term
was
over
and
tomorrow
were
to
be
days
of
examination
the
boys
had
been
working
hard
for
it
none
harder
than
had
tip
it
was
the
first
examination
which
had
ever
come
to
him
in
this
exciting
way
always
before
he
had
been
among
the
few
inevitable
dunces
running
away
from
examination
altogether
or
else
laughing
over
his
own
blundering
ignorance
but
it
was
different
he
stood
there
on
the
stage
among
the
workers
proudly
answering
his
teacher
questions
and
looking
proudly
over
at
the
group
of
idlers
bob
turner
at
their
head
who
loitered
near
the
windows
wondering
that
he
could
ever
have
been
of
their
number
this
was
going
to
be
a
great
day
for
tip
it
is
true
he
was
far
behind
some
others
of
his
age
so
far
that
not
a
single
class
of
howard
minturn
and
ellis
holbrook
were
to
be
examined
that
day
the
advance
classes
being
put
for
the
next
day
while
all
of
his
came
that
morning
but
then
tip
knew
there
was
change
enough
in
him
to
call
the
attention
of
every
one
present
he
felt
the
change
in
himself
his
mother
felt
it
when
she
that
morning
brushed
his
hair
for
him
and
fastened
a
clean
collar
on
his
jacket
the
boys
in
school
felt
it
he
had
taken
his
place
among
the
workers
the
bell
rang
at
last
and
the
scholars
filed
in
and
took
their
places
there
were
visitors
even
in
the
early
morning
the
people
liked
to
attend
burrows
examinations
tip
class
in
reading
came
first
on
the
list
and
never
had
his
eyes
been
so
bright
or
his
face
so
eager
tip
had
learned
to
read
patiently
earnestly
he
had
plodded
on
through
the
long
winter
now
his
sad
blunderings
in
that
line
were
over
for
ever
not
a
boy
in
school
read
more
slowly
distinctly
and
correctly
than
tip
lewis
the
selections
were
to
be
made
by
the
committee
immediately
after
class
of
those
who
were
considered
ready
to
enter
the
history
class
on
the
following
term
this
was
the
highest
reading
class
in
the
school
and
tip
eyes
fairly
danced
when
holbrook
who
was
chairman
of
the
committee
out
of
a
class
of
thirteen
read
but
two
names
thomas
jones
and
edward
lewis
hallo
tip
howard
minturn
had
said
to
him
at
recess
let
shake
hands
welcome
to
history
it
awfully
hard
and
interesting
and
tip
did
shake
hands
and
laughed
and
looked
over
at
the
other
clique
the
dunces
with
a
nod
to
bob
turner
and
wondered
how
he
have
borne
it
to
have
been
numbered
with
them
that
day
then
he
felt
that
he
was
climbing
into
the
first
set
and
climbing
in
spelling
too
he
came
off
conqueror
spelled
down
the
class
spelled
until
burrows
closed
his
book
with
the
words
i
presume
you
are
tired
of
this
gentlemen
and
as
our
examinations
are
confined
to
the
lessons
i
think
it
will
hardly
pay
to
go
further
for
edward
has
not
missed
since
the
second
week
in
the
term
so
again
flushed
and
excited
tip
went
to
his
seat
victorious
only
arithmetic
now
and
he
would
be
through
with
the
working
part
of
the
day
it
was
the
last
recitation
in
the
morning
and
he
was
so
eager
and
anxious
to
do
well
that
he
began
to
grow
nervous
the
class
was
called
at
last
they
had
gone
slowly
and
carefully
through
long
division
and
would
be
ready
for
fractions
next
term
the
recitation
passed
off
finely
tip
had
not
studied
day
and
night
during
the
winter
for
nothing
he
was
at
the
board
working
an
example
in
long
division
it
was
almost
finished
the
hand
of
the
clock
pointed
to
ten
minutes
of
twelve
in
ten
minutes
he
would
be
through
and
his
name
would
stand
on
that
honoured
list
among
those
who
had
not
missed
one
word
or
made
one
mistake
during
the
examination
his
hand
began
to
tremble
what
was
the
matter
with
that
example
oh
what
the
matter
the
remainder
was
too
large
no
it
was
too
small
no
it
was
he
did
know
what
everybody
was
watching
him
he
heard
a
boy
laugh
softly
he
had
made
a
mistake
then
what
was
it
where
was
it
burrows
voice
came
to
him
calm
and
kind
edward
do
get
excited
look
at
your
remainder
closely
take
the
first
figures
of
divisor
and
remainder
nine
in
how
many
times
that
will
help
you
ellis
holbrook
stood
but
a
step
from
the
blackboard
just
behind
him
tip
heard
his
low
whisper
seven
and
without
waiting
to
think
indeed
he
was
too
nervous
to
think
he
caught
at
the
number
seven
times
he
said
hurriedly
then
he
heard
bursts
of
laughter
from
the
boys
and
dashed
down
his
chalk
in
an
agony
of
shame
and
pain
and
the
clock
struck
twelve
the
honour
was
lost
the
boys
gathered
around
him
after
school
was
closed
it
was
too
bad
tip
howard
minturn
said
in
a
tone
of
honest
sympathy
you
have
had
it
in
a
minute
more
i
have
had
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
ellis
holbrook
and
he
a
mean
scamp
tip
answered
in
a
rage
whew
said
will
bailey
what
did
ellis
do
and
ellis
turned
and
proudly
confronted
the
angry
boy
he
told
me
wrong
just
on
purpose
that
what
he
did
and
he
knows
it
and
tip
broke
away
from
them
and
dashed
out
of
the
room
howard
minturn
stood
aghast
that
ellis
holbrook
his
best
friend
and
the
very
pink
of
honour
among
the
boys
should
do
so
mean
a
thing
he
could
not
think
and
yet
it
was
hard
to
think
that
tip
had
not
told
the
truth
what
does
he
mean
ellis
he
asked
at
last
you
have
to
ask
him
if
you
want
to
find
out
said
ellis
haughtily
he
knows
better
than
anybody
else
what
he
means
i
guess
the
boys
started
homeward
presently
in
a
body
bob
turner
and
his
friends
surrounded
tip
and
bob
who
never
lost
a
good
opportunity
for
teasing
commenced
at
once
poor
little
fellow
missed
his
lesson
so
he
did
do
him
cry
him
shall
have
a
penny
to
buy
a
with
hold
your
tongue
answered
tip
too
angry
to
see
how
foolish
it
was
to
let
such
words
coming
from
a
boy
who
did
know
a
single
line
of
the
provoke
him
a
pity
began
bob
again
when
it
had
spelled
its
lesson
all
so
nice
and
had
its
face
washed
and
its
hair
combed
so
pretty
must
cry
now
to
spoil
its
face
poor
little
fellow
tip
turned
to
his
tormentor
a
face
perfectly
white
with
rage
and
the
boys
hardly
knew
his
voice
bob
turner
if
you
say
another
word
i
knock
you
down
and
thrash
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
i
will
oh
tip
lewis
god
forgive
you
for
the
way
in
which
you
in
your
blind
rage
have
finished
that
sentence
for
the
use
which
you
have
made
of
that
great
name
which
above
all
others
you
profess
to
reverence
and
fear
the
awful
word
once
spoken
recalled
him
to
himself
he
clapped
both
hands
over
his
face
and
ran
wildly
up
the
hill
then
down
out
of
sight
the
boys
had
all
heard
it
howard
ellis
will
bailey
and
a
others
were
just
behind
him
ellis
holbrook
pride
rose
high
there
your
wonderful
boy
he
said
who
was
so
changed
and
has
taken
it
upon
himself
to
preach
so
many
sermons
to
i
sure
i
never
finished
any
of
my
angry
speeches
with
an
oath
if
i
so
far
below
him
what
an
afternoon
that
was
to
tip
he
will
forget
it
he
went
no
farther
than
the
great
tree
which
was
budding
out
in
spring
green
down
he
sat
on
a
stone
and
once
more
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
such
a
storm
of
rage
and
pain
swept
over
him
as
he
had
never
known
before
how
could
he
how
he
have
said
that
word
ever
since
he
had
learned
to
pray
he
had
been
afraid
of
that
sin
afraid
he
might
forget
and
go
back
to
his
old
habits
and
he
had
watched
and
guarded
his
lips
with
such
care
and
prayer
but
lately
he
had
given
up
all
fear
it
had
been
such
a
long
time
and
he
had
never
once
fallen
he
felt
sure
that
he
never
would
again
he
had
felt
so
sure
and
proud
and
strong
that
he
had
asked
no
help
from
god
that
day
he
had
been
so
eager
to
spend
every
moment
on
his
arithmetic
that
he
had
found
no
time
to
go
to
his
bible
for
strength
no
wonder
oh
no
wonder
that
he
fell
he
had
been
standing
too
firmly
feeling
no
need
of
help
now
what
should
he
do
how
low
he
felt
how
mean
could
god
forgive
him
yes
he
tip
felt
in
his
soul
that
there
was
nothing
which
god
could
do
and
yet
he
felt
too
mean
and
fallen
to
dare
to
ask
him
for
anything
more
he
forgot
for
the
moment
that
jesus
christ
died
to
save
the
sun
went
on
over
his
head
and
commenced
his
afternoon
work
then
there
came
up
the
hill
the
sound
of
the
but
tip
took
no
notice
of
that
he
did
want
to
of
school
much
less
even
he
began
to
fumble
presently
for
his
bible
he
have
some
help
it
opened
of
itself
at
the
psalms
and
he
read
the
first
line
which
he
saw
unto
thee
o
god
do
we
give
thanks
no
not
that
and
he
turned
back
a
couple
of
leaves
make
a
joyful
noise
no
no
he
did
want
to
hear
anything
about
joy
his
heart
was
as
heavy
as
lead
so
he
turned
over
several
leaves
at
once
he
find
something
that
would
read
as
if
it
meant
him
o
lord
rebuke
me
not
in
thy
wrath
neither
chasten
me
in
thy
sore
displeasure
oh
that
was
it
god
was
very
angry
with
him
a
right
to
be
this
was
just
what
he
ought
to
say
he
read
on
through
the
psalm
almost
every
verse
seemed
for
him
and
when
he
read
the
one
next
to
the
last
forsake
me
not
o
lord
o
my
god
be
not
far
from
me
he
said
it
over
and
over
and
finally
in
a
great
burst
of
tears
got
down
and
said
it
on
his
knees
the
short
spring
day
was
over
and
the
chilly
night
was
setting
in
tip
had
reached
home
finally
had
split
the
wood
for
the
next
day
done
whatever
he
could
find
to
do
about
the
house
and
then
carried
the
vests
which
his
mother
had
just
finished
to
the
going
away
around
behind
the
mill
so
as
to
avoid
passing
the
schoolhouse
lest
he
might
chance
to
see
some
of
the
boys
then
he
came
home
ate
his
supper
in
silence
and
went
up
to
his
attic
he
felt
better
than
he
had
at
noon
but
his
heart
was
still
heavy
and
he
dreaded
the
next
day
not
knowing
what
he
ought
to
do
or
how
to
do
it
this
was
thursday
evening
but
he
did
mean
to
go
to
kitty
had
asked
him
had
even
coaxed
a
little
but
he
said
no
not
he
felt
stiff
and
sore
from
his
long
sitting
under
the
great
tree
in
the
early
spring
dampness
he
told
himself
that
this
was
the
reason
why
he
was
not
going
to
but
the
real
one
was
he
felt
as
if
he
could
not
possibly
face
burrows
that
evening
and
not
holbrook
of
course
ellis
had
told
him
all
about
it
he
felt
very
tired
and
his
head
and
limbs
ached
he
was
going
to
read
a
chapter
in
his
bible
and
go
to
bed
he
chose
the
same
psalm
which
had
come
to
him
with
so
much
power
that
afternoon
read
it
slowly
and
carefully
then
knelt
down
to
pray
and
as
he
did
so
a
new
trouble
loomed
up
before
him
what
should
he
do
he
had
prayed
for
ellis
holbrook
and
bob
turner
ever
since
he
began
to
pray
for
himself
but
he
felt
as
though
he
could
not
possibly
pray
for
either
of
them
both
had
tried
to
injure
him
both
had
succeeded
he
wished
them
no
harm
he
did
want
to
choke
or
drown
them
as
he
had
felt
like
doing
at
noon
but
clearly
he
did
want
to
pray
for
them
he
had
arisen
from
his
knees
and
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
box
which
was
his
table
and
chair
with
a
very
troubled
face
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
he
felt
that
he
could
not
pray
for
those
boys
just
then
at
last
he
thought
he
had
found
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
he
said
to
himself
that
he
was
very
tired
almost
sick
he
would
just
repeat
the
lord
prayer
and
go
to
bed
in
the
morning
very
likely
he
should
feel
differently
he
almost
knew
he
should
so
he
knelt
down
once
more
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
slowly
reverently
through
the
sweet
petition
until
he
came
to
forgive
us
our
debts
as
we
there
he
stopped
he
understood
that
prayer
they
had
been
taking
it
up
in
sunday
school
a
sentence
at
a
time
and
talking
about
it
and
only
the
sunday
before
last
that
sentence
had
been
explained
tip
could
not
finish
it
there
was
no
getting
around
the
fact
that
he
had
not
forgiven
either
ellis
or
bob
once
more
he
got
up
and
took
a
seat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
to
think
he
was
never
so
perplexed
in
his
life
what
ought
he
to
do
could
he
pray
at
all
holbrook
had
said
he
must
never
mock
god
by
asking
for
what
he
did
not
mean
and
to
say
those
words
as
we
forgive
our
debtors
feeling
as
he
did
would
be
mocking
god
he
ought
not
to
feel
so
but
how
could
he
help
it
suddenly
with
a
little
sigh
of
relief
he
went
down
on
his
knees
again
he
had
thought
of
something
which
he
could
say
oh
jesus
make
me
feel
like
praying
for
bob
and
ellis
make
me
want
them
to
be
christians
as
hard
as
i
did
last
night
make
me
feel
like
forgiving
them
then
there
was
silence
in
the
lonely
attic
while
tip
still
on
his
knees
struggled
with
the
evil
spirit
within
him
and
came
off
conqueror
for
presently
he
added
oh
dear
jesus
i
forgive
them
both
and
then
he
finished
the
prayer
forgive
us
our
debts
as
we
forgive
our
debtors
while
he
went
around
after
that
making
ready
for
rest
and
sleep
the
peace
of
god
which
passeth
understanding
came
down
and
settled
in
his
heart
presently
he
seemed
to
come
to
another
difficulty
for
he
sat
down
with
one
boot
in
his
hand
and
one
still
on
his
foot
this
question
however
was
settled
promptly
he
pulled
the
boot
on
again
in
a
hurry
then
picked
up
his
jacket
and
put
that
on
seized
his
hat
and
ran
kitty
he
said
putting
his
head
in
at
the
kitchen
door
i
going
after
all
come
on
and
kitty
joyfully
ran
for
her
hood
and
shawl
but
tip
did
not
open
his
lips
in
that
evening
he
felt
bowed
down
to
the
very
ground
with
shame
he
did
not
once
raise
his
eyes
to
the
seat
where
howard
minturn
will
bailey
and
others
of
the
schoolboys
were
sitting
and
when
the
short
hour
was
gone
he
made
haste
to
get
out
from
holbrook
sight
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
but
he
had
much
reason
after
that
to
thank
god
that
he
did
not
succeed
he
had
just
got
from
under
the
gaze
of
the
and
stood
a
minute
in
the
darkness
waiting
for
kitty
when
he
felt
holbrook
hand
on
his
arm
and
heard
his
kind
quiet
voice
edward
holbrook
has
some
little
business
to
transact
with
kitty
shall
i
walk
with
you
and
as
tip
saw
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
walked
by
his
side
he
said
i
did
see
you
at
school
this
afternoon
how
was
that
holbrook
did
ellis
tell
you
about
it
this
noon
ellis
has
told
me
nothing
i
heard
from
one
of
the
smaller
boys
a
very
sad
story
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
no
sir
i
have
not
it
all
true
i
got
awful
mad
and
i
said
mad
things
i
i
did
worse
than
that
tip
voice
sank
to
a
solemn
whisper
holbrook
too
was
silent
and
sad
at
last
he
said
what
edward
do
you
mean
to
give
up
and
go
back
to
the
old
life
and
he
remembered
years
after
just
how
painfully
his
heart
throbbed
while
he
waited
for
tip
answer
it
was
prompt
and
plain
no
sir
god
would
even
let
me
do
that
and
then
for
a
minute
holbrook
did
not
speak
for
very
thankfulness
that
through
all
this
maze
of
sin
god
was
leading
tip
into
the
light
again
do
you
feel
that
you
have
god
forgiveness
he
asked
speaking
gently
yes
sir
tip
could
not
give
very
long
answers
that
evening
why
were
you
so
quiet
in
because
said
tip
speaking
low
i
was
ashamed
to
say
anything
before
you
or
burrows
or
the
boys
after
what
happened
today
more
ashamed
with
us
than
you
were
with
god
yes
sir
i
was
because
god
knows
all
about
it
just
how
sorry
i
am
and
how
he
has
forgiven
me
and
is
going
to
help
me
and
you
know
that
again
holbrook
was
thankful
how
about
edward
he
asked
at
last
and
this
time
tip
answer
was
very
low
i
do
know
i
do
know
what
to
do
if
you
knew
what
was
right
to
do
would
you
it
i
pretty
sure
i
to
sir
well
did
you
honour
or
dishonour
christ
tip
answer
was
in
a
more
timid
tone
than
he
often
spoke
i
dishonoured
him
do
the
boys
know
that
you
are
very
sorry
and
have
asked
god
to
forgive
you
no
sir
they
do
know
anything
about
it
do
you
think
for
the
honour
of
christ
they
ought
to
i
suppose
so
who
ought
to
tell
them
no
immediate
answer
came
to
this
then
after
a
little
holbrook
how
could
i
tell
them
to
each
one
about
it
see
if
you
can
not
answer
your
own
question
will
not
all
the
boys
be
likely
to
hear
about
it
yes
sir
they
be
sure
to
and
would
they
all
be
likely
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
unless
you
spoke
to
all
at
once
but
holbrook
if
i
did
that
it
would
have
to
be
in
school
well
but
is
the
last
day
and
it
examination
well
that
short
word
seemed
to
have
a
good
deal
of
power
over
tip
for
he
only
answered
it
by
saying
after
a
long
silence
holbrook
i
wonder
if
you
can
think
how
very
hard
that
would
be
edward
i
wonder
if
you
can
think
how
very
hard
it
was
for
your
saviour
to
listen
to
your
words
this
noon
and
holbrook
heard
no
more
from
tip
save
when
they
reached
the
corner
a
very
low
very
grave
chapter
xxi
he
shall
call
upon
me
and
i
will
answer
him
i
will
be
with
him
in
trouble
i
will
deliver
him
and
honour
him
there
were
not
many
visitors
in
the
next
morning
it
was
too
early
as
yet
for
any
but
the
examining
committee
and
a
few
very
fond
very
anxious
mothers
burrows
hand
was
on
the
bell
in
a
few
moments
the
algebra
class
would
be
in
full
tide
of
recitation
ellis
and
howard
had
their
slates
in
their
hands
ready
to
start
at
the
first
sound
when
tip
lewis
left
his
seat
and
made
his
way
towards
the
stage
burrows
looked
surprised
this
was
entirely
out
of
order
but
a
look
at
tip
face
made
him
change
his
mind
about
sending
him
back
to
his
seat
and
bend
his
head
to
listen
to
the
few
words
that
were
hurriedly
whispered
in
his
ear
then
he
looked
more
surprised
hesitated
a
minute
then
asked
had
you
better
wait
until
noon
and
i
can
detain
the
scholars
a
few
moments
no
said
tip
shaking
his
head
and
speaking
earnestly
i
afraid
if
i
wait
till
noon
i
sha
do
it
at
all
very
well
burrows
answered
finally
scholars
one
of
your
number
tells
me
that
he
has
something
of
importance
to
say
to
you
we
will
wait
and
hear
him
it
was
well
for
tip
that
he
was
a
bold
boy
that
every
day
of
his
life
had
been
such
as
to
teach
him
a
lesson
of
boldness
else
his
courage
would
surely
have
failed
him
when
he
felt
the
many
curious
eyes
resting
on
him
as
it
was
his
face
was
scarlet
when
he
turned
it
away
from
the
desk
and
towards
the
boys
yet
he
spoke
promptly
as
he
always
did
when
he
spoke
at
all
i
want
to
tell
the
boys
that
i
am
sorry
for
yesterday
i
suppose
they
all
know
what
i
did
i
got
awful
mad
and
i
i
said
a
dreadful
word
i
did
think
i
would
ever
be
so
wicked
again
i
feel
awful
about
it
but
i
do
want
the
boys
to
think
that
i
do
love
jesus
any
more
because
i
do
and
he
is
going
to
help
me
try
such
a
silence
as
was
in
that
schoolroom
then
the
boys
had
never
felt
before
burrows
face
was
shaded
with
his
hand
he
let
the
silence
rest
upon
them
for
a
moment
after
tip
had
taken
his
seat
then
he
spoke
low
and
solemnly
boys
what
god
has
forgiven
i
feel
sure
that
no
scholar
of
mine
will
be
mean
enough
ever
to
mention
again
then
the
bell
sounded
and
the
business
of
the
day
went
on
tip
had
laid
his
head
down
on
the
desk
the
minute
he
took
his
seat
and
he
kept
it
there
throughout
the
recitation
he
had
been
through
a
fearful
struggle
it
was
hard
work
for
a
boy
like
him
to
stand
up
before
the
school
and
tell
them
how
he
had
fallen
but
it
was
over
now
and
from
his
very
soul
he
felt
that
he
had
done
right
bob
turner
sitting
beside
him
was
quiet
and
sober
and
when
tip
raised
his
arm
with
such
a
sudden
jerk
that
he
knocked
his
arithmetic
to
the
floor
bob
leaned
over
and
quietly
picked
it
up
and
laid
it
back
in
its
place
which
was
a
wonderful
thing
for
bob
turner
to
do
at
noon
the
boys
gathered
around
tip
quiet
and
kind
no
one
spoke
of
what
had
been
important
event
of
the
morning
all
were
on
good
behaviour
ellis
holbrook
came
into
their
midst
tip
he
said
speaking
gravely
yet
very
coldly
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
know
that
you
made
quite
a
blunder
yesterday
when
you
said
i
told
you
wrong
i
had
the
slightest
notion
of
telling
you
right
or
wrong
but
i
know
how
you
came
to
think
so
i
was
looking
out
a
word
in
burrows
dictionary
and
stood
just
behind
you
when
bailey
leaned
over
and
asked
me
how
many
there
were
in
your
class
when
all
were
present
and
i
answered
him
seven
tip
looked
perfectly
astonished
why
did
you
say
so
yesterday
he
asked
at
last
because
you
did
give
me
a
chance
ellis
answered
coolly
i
not
in
the
habit
of
cheating
nor
of
being
told
that
i
do
so
i
was
not
prepared
with
an
answer
that
true
said
tip
after
a
minute
answering
the
first
part
of
ellis
sentence
that
true
i
did
i
was
mad
and
i
just
banged
off
before
anybody
could
say
anything
i
might
have
known
you
did
do
any
such
thing
it
ai
like
you
and
tip
walked
away
leaving
ellis
to
think
that
the
boy
who
was
so
far
below
him
had
shown
much
the
better
spirit
of
the
two
the
busy
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
last
recitation
was
over
and
the
boys
were
in
a
state
of
grand
excitement
waiting
to
hear
the
report
of
the
committee
waiting
to
know
whose
names
were
to
stand
on
the
roll
of
honour
having
passed
through
the
entire
examination
without
a
mistake
poor
tip
was
sad
yesterday
morning
he
had
felt
so
sure
that
his
name
would
have
an
honourable
place
and
to
him
it
was
so
much
more
exciting
because
it
would
be
for
the
first
time
how
hard
he
had
worked
and
now
it
was
all
lost
stupidly
lost
too
he
said
to
himself
over
an
example
that
he
had
done
a
dozen
times
and
he
drew
a
heavy
sigh
and
roused
himself
to
listen
to
the
report
burrows
had
already
called
for
it
and
holbrook
as
chairman
of
the
committee
had
arisen
but
instead
of
reading
the
report
said
burrows
if
there
is
time
i
should
like
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
scholars
boys
you
were
all
listeners
to
edward
lewis
examination
yesterday
and
i
presume
you
know
better
than
i
do
how
hard
he
has
worked
now
i
think
any
one
who
watched
him
yesterday
could
not
have
failed
to
see
that
had
he
not
grown
excited
and
nervous
he
could
have
worked
that
example
burrows
may
i
put
a
question
to
vote
and
burrows
giving
a
hearty
consent
he
continued
very
well
now
i
want
every
boy
here
who
is
willing
to
allow
edward
lewis
to
go
to
the
board
and
try
that
example
and
if
he
succeeds
give
him
the
place
which
would
have
been
his
yesterday
to
stand
up
ellis
holbrook
was
the
first
to
spring
to
his
feet
and
every
single
boy
in
the
room
followed
his
example
tip
alone
sitting
still
with
burning
cheeks
well
done
said
holbrook
now
it
only
remains
to
get
your
consent
to
our
plan
which
burrows
gave
by
wheeling
his
table
from
before
the
blackboard
and
picking
up
an
arithmetic
you
may
come
forward
edward
i
will
dictate
the
example
which
one
is
it
the
sir
page
by
this
time
tip
was
at
the
board
how
they
watched
him
how
fearful
his
teacher
was
for
him
how
he
longed
to
have
him
succeed
tip
worked
fast
and
boldly
his
hand
did
not
tremble
chalk
and
fingers
and
brain
did
their
duty
the
terrible
nine
in
how
many
times
as
a
test
for
the
larger
number
was
reached
and
an
unusually
large
and
bold
figure
was
placed
in
the
quotient
a
few
more
rapid
dashes
and
with
a
grand
flourish
after
the
seventeen
remainder
tip
threw
down
the
chalk
pushed
back
the
hair
from
his
hot
temples
and
walked
to
his
seat
the
boys
could
not
keep
quiet
any
longer
a
very
soft
tapping
was
heard
at
first
then
finding
they
were
not
silenced
it
rose
to
a
loud
decided
stamping
of
many
feet
but
holbrook
was
on
feet
again
and
they
were
quiet
directly
for
the
report
was
finally
to
be
read
my
son
said
holbrook
not
long
after
laying
his
hand
kindly
on
ellis
shoulder
as
he
was
hurrying
from
the
room
what
do
you
think
of
edward
religion
i
think
it
is
honest
sir
ellis
answered
quickly
excuse
me
father
if
you
please
i
must
see
howard
a
minute
before
he
goes
and
so
he
ran
away
from
his
father
longing
look
as
for
tip
he
borrowed
from
howard
minturn
a
copy
of
the
village
paper
which
came
out
a
few
days
after
and
read
the
report
of
the
examination
read
this
sentence
and
among
all
the
pupils
perhaps
no
one
of
them
has
made
more
rapid
or
astonishing
progress
than
has
edward
lewis
then
while
the
twilight
deepened
he
turned
eagerly
to
the
next
column
which
read
in
this
way
roll
of
honour
being
an
alphabetically
arranged
list
of
those
who
passed
the
entire
examination
without
making
an
error

i
will
lead
them
in
paths
that
they
have
not
known
see
here
tip
called
minturn
appearing
in
his
store
door
one
morning
not
long
after
the
examination
i
want
to
talk
to
you
tip
swung
his
basket
off
his
shoulder
and
went
into
the
store
he
was
at
work
for
dewey
and
every
piece
of
meat
which
he
carried
home
took
the
form
in
his
eyes
of
a
latin
grammar
and
a
dictionary
for
these
two
books
were
what
he
was
at
present
aiming
after
i
in
a
great
hurry
minturn
he
said
i
got
a
piece
of
meat
for
your
folks
in
my
basket
and
i
expect
they
want
it
they
have
to
wait
till
they
get
it
answered
minturn
but
i
never
hinder
folks
long
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourself
now
school
out
oh
work
anything
i
can
find
to
do
while
vacation
lasts
so
you
going
to
keep
on
at
school
are
you
i
thought
likely
since
your
father
was
laid
up
you
he
hunting
for
steady
work
so
you
could
help
the
family
along
there
a
hard
winter
coming
you
know
there
was
no
mistaking
minturn
tone
it
said
as
plainly
as
words
could
have
done
that
what
i
think
you
ought
to
do
anyhow
tip
looked
troubled
there
nothing
for
me
to
do
he
said
at
last
i
do
know
of
a
place
in
this
town
where
i
could
get
steady
work
that
i
could
do
and
besides
if
there
was
i
after
an
education
now
my
brother
is
here
from
albany
minturn
made
answer
to
this
he
is
a
merchant
has
a
large
store
there
and
keeps
a
great
many
clerks
been
plagued
to
death
lately
with
one
of
his
boys
when
he
sent
him
home
with
bundles
he
open
them
and
help
himself
and
my
brother
told
me
last
night
if
i
could
warrant
him
a
boy
who
was
perfectly
honest
take
him
home
with
him
pay
his
fare
down
and
do
well
by
him
i
thought
of
you
right
away
and
i
told
my
brother
that
you
were
just
the
boy
for
him
you
be
as
true
as
steel
but
then
if
you
going
to
keep
on
at
school
it
all
up
minium
did
not
add
that
he
had
kept
his
brother
until
eleven
the
night
before
telling
him
tip
history
what
a
boy
he
had
been
how
he
had
changed
how
he
was
struggling
upward
and
finally
the
whole
story
of
the
examination
the
failure
the
downfall
the
public
confession
nor
how
his
brother
had
listened
eagerly
and
had
said
with
energy
after
the
story
was
finished
such
a
boy
as
that
ought
to
be
helped
and
i
ready
to
help
him
none
of
this
did
tip
hear
but
he
stooped
down
for
his
basket
when
minturn
had
finished
speaking
with
a
bright
blush
on
his
cheek
it
was
something
for
a
boy
like
him
to
be
called
as
true
as
steel
yes
he
said
decidedly
i
going
to
keep
on
at
school
certain
thank
you
all
the
same
and
out
he
went
yet
all
the
way
up
and
down
the
streets
his
thoughts
were
busy
over
what
he
had
just
heard
it
was
certainly
as
poor
as
they
were
that
he
began
to
work
his
mother
sewing
supported
the
family
now
and
hard
and
late
into
the
nights
she
had
to
work
to
keep
them
from
hunger
tip
had
thought
of
this
question
before
but
had
always
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
that
work
was
not
by
any
means
an
easy
thing
to
get
in
the
village
the
odd
jobs
which
he
could
find
out
of
school
hours
being
really
the
only
things
he
could
get
to
do
but
no
such
comfort
came
to
him
here
was
a
chance
and
a
splendid
one
for
getting
steady
work
and
by
and
by
good
wages
probably
why
was
he
glad
oh
ever
since
he
gave
himself
to
christ
there
had
been
in
his
heart
a
longing
to
get
an
education
and
not
only
that
but
to
become
a
minister
very
small
faint
hopes
he
had
and
even
those
were
frightened
sometimes
at
their
own
boldness
but
every
day
the
desire
grew
stronger
and
it
did
not
seem
as
though
he
could
possibly
give
up
school
now
it
was
out
of
the
question
he
told
himself
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
enjoy
his
books
so
much
and
was
doing
well
burrows
would
be
disappointed
in
him
he
had
encouraged
him
to
study
no
it
could
be
done
he
would
consider
the
matter
settled
and
yet
there
was
his
mother
working
day
and
night
and
he
her
only
son
not
helping
there
was
his
father
growing
weaker
every
day
coughing
harder
every
night
long
ago
they
had
given
up
the
hope
that
the
cough
would
ever
leave
him
there
was
kitty
who
ought
to
be
in
school
but
could
not
because
her
mother
have
the
little
help
which
she
could
give
tip
was
half
distracted
with
thinking
about
it
he
felt
provoked
at
minturn
and
brother
and
the
store
in
albany
and
the
boy
who
helped
himself
out
of
other
people
bundles
they
were
all
trying
to
cheat
him
out
of
his
education
a
dozen
times
he
said
it
was
settled
and
as
many
times
began
at
the
beginning
to
think
it
all
over
again
he
went
home
finally
after
the
meat
was
carried
around
but
this
did
help
him
any
home
gone
back
to
its
old
state
of
dirt
and
disorder
kitty
first
attempt
had
been
too
successful
and
she
had
liked
the
looks
of
things
too
well
to
give
up
so
there
was
a
great
change
for
the
better
in
the
housekeeping
which
both
kitty
and
her
mother
enjoyed
still
there
was
no
denying
that
though
a
clean
it
was
a
very
forlorn
little
room
with
very
few
things
for
comfort
or
convenience
tip
had
never
seen
this
with
such
eyes
as
he
did
today
so
coming
home
did
not
quiet
the
vexing
thoughts
he
split
wood
and
pumped
water
without
whistling
a
note
growing
more
sober
every
minute
at
last
after
supper
when
the
work
was
all
done
that
he
could
do
he
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
it
was
so
nice
to
have
time
for
thought
he
could
go
up
to
his
attic
and
he
would
not
come
down
no
not
if
it
was
in
three
days
until
this
thing
was
decided
finally
and
for
ever
kitty
sewed
steadily
on
the
seam
which
her
mother
had
fixed
for
her
and
wondered
why
tip
did
come
down
and
hear
her
lesson
which
had
been
ready
for
him
this
hour
it
was
another
hour
before
he
came
then
his
mother
said
tip
if
you
a
cent
in
the
world
do
take
it
and
go
and
get
your
father
some
of
that
i
do
believe
he
has
stopped
coughing
since
supper
tip
took
his
hat
and
started
for
the
store
as
he
went
he
whistled
a
little
the
was
found
at
a
store
away
up
town
and
getting
a
paper
of
it
tip
dashed
on
around
the
corner
and
opened
store
door
when
is
your
brother
going
home
he
asked
without
ceremony
seeing
minturn
behind
the
counter
next
monday
well
i
going
to
talk
to
father
and
i
think
likely
i
want
to
go
along
with
him
all
right
so
tip
slammed
to
the
door
and
ran
away
and
minturn
never
knew
what
a
downfall
that
decision
had
been
to
the
boy
dear
hopes
and
plans
it
was
all
settled
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
minturn
from
albany
was
very
kind
tip
was
to
have
wages
that
seemed
a
small
fortune
to
him
and
enough
had
been
advanced
to
get
him
a
new
suit
of
clothes
which
his
mother
made
one
would
have
supposed
that
the
future
would
look
bright
to
him
yet
it
was
with
a
very
sad
heart
that
he
took
his
seat
in
that
thursday
evening
the
last
time
he
expected
to
be
in
that
room
for
he
did
know
how
long
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
ought
to
be
very
glad
and
thankful
and
was
at
all
through
the
opening
hymns
and
prayers
his
heart
kept
growing
heavier
every
moment
and
it
was
not
until
holbrook
arose
and
repeated
the
text
which
he
had
chosen
for
the
evening
that
tip
could
arouse
himself
to
listen
it
was
a
queer
text
so
he
thought
who
shall
roll
away
the
stone
what
could
holbrook
be
going
to
say
on
that
he
found
out
and
had
reason
to
remember
it
for
ever
after
as
he
went
out
from
that
meeting
his
thoughts
had
he
spoken
them
would
have
been
like
these
that
true
i
do
believe
any
man
but
holbrook
would
ever
have
thought
of
it
they
worried
at
a
great
rate
about
that
stone
how
they
would
get
it
rolled
away
and
when
they
got
there
it
was
gone
remember
that
i
do
just
as
he
said
when
i
see
a
stone
ahead
of
me
i
wo
stop
and
fret
about
it
i
walk
straight
up
to
it
and
when
i
get
there
maybe
it
will
roll
out
of
my
way
chapter
xxiii
a
word
fitly
spoken
is
like
apples
of
gold
in
pictures
of
silver
behold
tip
now
in
albany
far
away
from
home
and
friends
from
every
one
that
he
had
ever
seen
before
save
howard
minturn
young
uncle
but
he
had
been
there
some
time
and
was
growing
into
a
feeling
it
had
been
a
wonderful
change
to
him
minturn
did
not
board
his
clerks
but
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
he
had
taken
tip
home
with
him
for
a
few
days
the
boy
felt
as
though
the
roses
on
the
carpets
were
made
of
glass
and
would
smash
if
he
stepped
on
them
but
he
was
getting
used
to
it
all
he
could
sit
squarely
on
his
chair
at
the
table
instead
of
on
the
edge
spread
his
napkin
over
his
lap
as
the
others
did
and
eat
his
pie
with
a
silver
fork
under
the
light
of
the
sparkling
gas
mother
said
little
alice
minturn
why
does
father
have
edward
board
here
and
sit
at
the
table
with
us
because
alice
your
father
wants
to
help
him
in
every
way
your
uncle
minturn
thinks
he
is
an
unusually
good
smart
boy
i
think
so
too
said
alice
and
was
satisfied
and
tip
lewis
was
tip
no
longer
no
one
knew
him
by
that
name
every
one
there
said
edward
save
the
store
clerks
and
they
called
him
ed
he
had
a
queer
feeling
sometimes
that
he
was
somebody
else
and
that
tip
lewis
whom
he
used
to
know
so
well
would
be
very
much
astonished
if
he
could
see
him
now
he
went
into
sabbath
school
and
became
a
member
of
minturn
bible
class
but
teachers
were
scarce
and
before
he
had
been
there
three
weeks
minturn
sent
him
to
take
charge
of
a
class
of
very
little
boys
who
called
him
lewis
and
made
him
feel
strange
and
tall
he
began
to
realize
that
he
was
almost
sixteen
years
old
and
growing
very
fast
he
was
leading
a
very
busy
life
at
work
all
day
in
and
for
the
store
and
in
the
evening
doing
all
he
could
with
his
books
those
books
and
his
love
for
them
were
a
great
safeguard
to
him
kept
him
away
from
many
a
temptation
to
go
astray
and
yet
it
was
hard
work
to
accomplish
much
in
the
little
time
he
had
and
with
no
helper
sometimes
he
sighed
wearily
and
felt
as
though
the
road
was
full
of
stones
i
pity
you
old
fellow
one
of
the
younger
clerks
said
to
him
one
evening
as
they
were
leaving
the
store
i
do
know
for
what
was
the
answer
why
minturn
pink
of
a
perfect
and
wonderful
and
altogether
amazing
son
ray
has
just
got
home
from
the
university
saw
him
pass
the
store
not
an
hour
ago
leaning
back
in
the
carriage
like
a
prince
what
he
asked
edward
he
a
prig
that
what
he
is
what
a
prig
ho
you
a
greeney
if
you
do
know
what
a
prig
is
wait
till
he
snubs
you
and
lords
it
over
you
awhile
then
i
guess
you
know
have
a
good
chance
seeing
you
right
there
at
the
house
all
the
while
i
would
be
in
your
shoes
for
a
penny
spite
of
its
making
him
a
great
greeney
edward
did
not
know
what
a
prig
was
but
judging
from
his
companion
tone
he
decided
that
it
must
be
something
very
disagreeable
he
went
home
feeling
cross
and
uncomfortable
wishing
that
ray
were
anybody
in
the
world
rather
than
minturn
son
or
anywhere
else
rather
than
at
home
he
was
beginning
to
have
such
a
nice
time
there
they
were
all
so
kind
to
him
and
really
seemed
to
like
him
it
was
too
bad
to
have
it
all
spoiled
i
know
what
kind
of
a
fellow
he
is
he
muttered
to
himself
he
like
that
symonds
who
comes
to
the
store
twice
a
week
or
so
after
kid
gloves
and
acts
as
if
he
thought
he
was
a
great
deal
too
good
to
ask
me
a
decent
question
my
i
wish
he
was
in
texas
the
was
a
blaze
of
light
when
he
peeped
in
soon
after
the
family
were
gathered
waiting
for
minturn
the
newcomer
sat
on
the
sofa
one
arm
little
alice
and
the
other
resting
gently
on
his
mother
lap
edward
guessed
by
his
mother
face
that
she
did
wish
he
was
in
texas
minturn
came
in
presently
and
edward
stole
into
the
room
just
behind
him
but
alice
called
him
eagerly
edward
ray
has
come
come
over
here
and
see
him
go
ahead
said
minturn
as
edward
stood
still
with
very
red
cheeks
and
ray
sat
up
and
held
out
his
hand
how
do
you
do
edward
alice
has
been
making
me
acquainted
with
you
this
afternoon
so
you
not
a
stranger
how
very
clear
and
kind
his
tones
were
edward
was
astonished
that
same
evening
he
was
more
astonished
he
was
in
the
library
at
work
over
his
books
minturn
had
to
go
to
a
committee
meeting
expecting
to
be
detained
late
as
he
arose
from
the
he
said
how
am
i
to
get
in
here
my
in
two
pieces
i
be
sir
said
edward
promptly
well
you
may
you
can
take
your
books
to
the
library
and
have
a
long
evening
to
pore
over
them
so
he
was
there
poring
over
them
with
all
his
might
when
the
door
opened
gently
and
ray
minturn
came
in
are
you
hard
at
work
he
asked
kindly
yes
sir
said
edward
wishing
he
would
go
out
again
but
he
seem
in
a
hurry
to
do
so
he
took
a
book
from
the
case
and
glanced
over
it
a
moment
then
came
towards
edward
what
are
you
studying
fractions
answered
edward
briefly
do
you
have
any
trouble
yes
lots
speaking
a
little
crossly
for
he
wanted
to
go
on
with
his
work
i
ca
get
this
one
i
at
to
save
my
head
suppose
i
see
what
is
the
matter
and
bay
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
and
sat
down
glancing
his
eye
over
the
slate
rather
suppose
you
see
for
yourself
he
said
in
a
few
moments
just
run
over
that
multiplication
at
the
top
of
the
slate
oh
bother
edward
said
after
he
had
obeyed
orders
that
figure
three
has
made
me
all
this
trouble
smaller
things
than
figure
threes
make
trouble
have
you
been
to
school
lately
always
till
i
came
here
but
i
might
just
as
well
have
been
out
until
last
winter
what
happened
last
winter
lots
of
things
answered
edward
with
brightening
eyes
but
he
did
seem
disposed
to
state
any
of
them
so
after
waiting
a
little
ray
asked
would
you
get
on
faster
with
your
books
if
you
had
a
teacher
think
likely
i
should
but
i
have
got
any
so
i
have
to
get
on
as
fast
as
i
can
how
would
it
do
if
i
should
play
teacher
while
i
am
at
home
and
give
you
the
hour
from
nine
till
ten
edward
laid
down
his
pencil
turned
his
eyes
for
the
first
time
full
upon
kay
and
looked
at
him
in
silent
astonishment
do
you
mean
it
he
asked
at
last
certainly
i
do
i
should
say
so
if
i
did
do
you
think
you
would
like
it
like
it
i
guess
i
would
but
i
do
know
what
do
you
do
it
for
because
i
am
glad
to
help
a
boy
who
seems
to
be
trying
to
help
himself
we
will
consider
it
settled
then
it
is
ten
will
you
come
out
to
prayers
now
and
at
this
the
astonished
look
on
edward
face
deepened
is
minturn
here
he
asked
no
but
his
son
is
are
you
so
surprised
that
i
should
have
prayers
in
my
father
absence
yes
said
edward
i
did
know
i
mean
i
did
think
you
did
think
i
had
learned
to
pray
perhaps
thank
god
i
have
then
he
laid
his
hand
kindly
on
edward
shoulder
have
learned
that
precious
lesson
yet
my
friend
yes
said
edward
softly
a
good
while
ago
i
am
very
glad
you
will
never
learn
anything
else
that
is
quite
so
important
what
is
all
the
study
for
by
the
way
have
you
any
plans
yes
said
edward
astonished
at
what
he
was
about
to
tell
to
a
stranger
i
want
to
get
an
education
and
then
if
i
possibly
do
that
i
want
to
be
a
minister
ray
hand
fell
from
his
shoulder
and
when
he
answered
this
his
voice
was
low
and
a
little
sad
god
bless
you
and
help
you
i
hope
you
will
never
have
to
give
it
up
edward
made
up
his
mind
that
night
that
a
prig
meant
the
best
and
kindest
yes
and
the
wisest
young
man
in
the
world
chapter
xxiv
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
the
long
bright
summer
days
and
the
glowing
autumn
days
were
gone
was
upon
them
during
all
this
time
edward
was
hard
at
work
there
was
plenty
of
business
to
be
done
at
the
store
he
had
been
promoted
very
rarely
was
he
called
on
to
carry
home
purchases
or
to
do
errands
he
had
his
counter
and
his
favourite
customers
there
had
been
another
change
too
which
edward
felt
sure
ray
had
had
a
hand
in
ray
had
a
hand
in
everything
that
was
good
and
thoughtful
he
had
long
evenings
for
study
now
he
came
up
to
dinner
with
minturn
at
six
and
had
no
further
work
to
do
until
the
next
day
oh
those
long
evenings
what
rapid
progress
he
made
what
a
teacher
ray
was
could
a
boy
help
getting
on
who
was
so
carefully
and
kindly
led
what
was
ray
to
him
teacher
friend
brother
constant
unfailing
loving
guide
edward
was
learning
to
love
him
with
an
almost
worship
meantime
every
one
saw
better
than
did
edward
himself
how
he
had
changed
he
had
not
been
in
constant
intercourse
with
a
christian
family
who
lived
their
religion
every
day
and
every
hour
for
nothing
his
improvement
had
been
constant
and
rapid
he
came
home
from
the
post
office
one
evening
with
his
hands
full
of
letters
among
them
a
very
one
for
himself
he
carried
the
others
to
the
library
and
his
own
to
his
room
such
an
odd
letter
as
it
was
he
was
glad
it
was
his
business
to
get
the
mail
and
that
none
of
the
other
clerks
had
seen
this
with
his
name
written
at
the
very
top
of
the
envelope
and
written
tip
at
that
how
oddly
it
looked
and
how
queerly
it
sounded
when
he
said
it
over
it
was
so
long
since
he
heard
that
name
he
never
wanted
to
again
he
was
glad
that
ray
minturn
had
never
called
him
tip
nor
heard
him
called
so
who
could
it
be
from
nobody
wrote
to
him
except
kitty
and
once
in
a
long
while
his
mother
but
this
was
no
at
last
he
broke
the
seal
and
read
deer
tip
mother
dead
i
feel
bad
you
kno
that
so
what
the
use
i
got
to
go
to
work
i
like
you
better
than
any
of
the
other
felows
always
did
ca
i
com
out
there
to
your
store
and
work
i
behave
myself
reel
wel
i
honour
bright
if
you
git
me
a
place
i
got
money
enuff
to
get
there
i
dug
potatoes
for
old
williams
and
earned
it
rite
to
me
rite
off
that
a
good
fellow
i
want
to
com
awful
bob
turner
edward
was
thunderstruck
he
dropped
the
letter
on
the
floor
in
disgust
what
was
to
be
done
now
the
idea
of
having
bob
turner
there
was
perfectly
dreadful
besides
thank
fortune
it
was
impossible
they
wanted
more
help
to
be
sure
had
been
looking
out
for
a
boy
that
very
day
but
not
such
a
one
as
bob
that
was
out
of
the
question
and
yet
bob
mother
was
dead
in
his
rude
careless
way
bob
had
loved
his
mother
rather
better
than
he
had
any
one
else
and
edward
did
not
doubt
that
he
felt
badly
he
was
without
friends
now
surely
he
needed
one
if
he
ever
did
but
it
was
disagreeable
to
think
of
having
him
there
he
was
so
different
from
any
of
the
others
and
he
would
call
tip
and
be
always
around
in
his
way
would
seem
to
lead
him
back
to
the
old
life
from
which
he
thought
he
had
escaped
altogether
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
but
then
and
now
came
a
startling
thought
how
long
he
had
been
praying
for
bob
perhaps
this
was
the
way
in
which
god
meant
to
answer
by
giving
him
a
chance
to
work
as
well
as
pray
perhaps
he
ought
to
be
to
have
him
come
no
matter
how
much
the
clerks
might
make
fun
of
him
for
having
such
a
friend
no
matter
how
much
pain
and
annoyance
it
might
cause
him
if
this
was
god
speaking
to
him
to
help
his
brother
how
dreadful
it
would
be
to
make
no
answer
he
sat
down
to
think
about
it
his
algebra
lay
open
before
him
he
was
not
quite
ready
for
kay
but
he
could
not
attend
to
algebra
now
let
me
see
he
said
if
there
be
such
a
thing
as
that
bob
could
come
what
would
i
do
for
him
one
of
two
things
is
certain
either
he
lead
me
or
i
shall
him
we
always
did
when
we
were
together
much
which
will
it
be
if
he
leads
me
he
lead
me
into
mischief
just
as
sure
as
the
world
if
i
lead
i
try
to
keep
him
out
of
mischief
it
clear
that
i
ought
to
be
the
leader
now
how
would
i
do
it
i
wonder
bob
ought
to
be
a
christian
he
wo
be
safe
two
minutes
at
a
time
until
he
is
if
god
says
anything
he
says
he
hear
prayer
if
i
believe
that
why
do
i
pray
for
bob
so
that
he
be
converted
i
pray
for
him
always
but
it
kind
of
praying
kind
of
as
if
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
hard
thing
for
god
to
do
after
all
wrong
god
wants
him
safe
and
he
knows
he
is
safe
now
and
willing
to
help
him
it
must
be
my
fault
that
he
do
my
business
and
lessons
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
are
putting
bob
and
ellis
and
even
father
pretty
much
out
of
my
thoughts
that
wrong
too
and
must
be
stopped
minturn
says
a
thing
is
never
half
done
that
has
a
corner
in
the
day
belonging
to
itself
i
try
that
rule
after
this
every
evening
at
eight
i
come
up
here
to
my
room
and
lock
the
door
and
i
pray
for
bob
i
pray
as
though
i
expected
an
answer
and
was
going
to
be
on
the
for
it
i
wo
let
anything
hinder
me
from
coming
at
just
that
time
unless
it
something
that
i
help
meantime
i
get
him
a
place
if
i
can
edward
was
as
straightforward
as
tip
had
been
this
point
decided
he
went
to
the
library
door
and
knocked
minturn
was
alone
and
busy
but
he
looked
up
as
edward
entered
in
answer
to
his
come
in
well
sir
what
is
it
have
you
time
for
a
little
piece
of
business
always
time
for
business
sit
down
what
is
it
about
have
you
found
a
boy
yet
no
have
you
yes
sir
there
a
boy
out
home
who
wants
to
come
i
just
had
a
letter
from
him
his
name
is
turner
bob
turner
is
he
a
good
boy
no
sir
well
that
plain
what
are
you
talking
about
then
i
want
you
to
make
him
a
good
boy
sir
humph
that
an
idea
i
ca
make
boys
over
new
is
he
honest
no
sir
i
do
think
he
is
very
not
what
you
mean
by
honest
but
his
mother
is
dead
and
he
has
any
friends
he
goes
with
a
miserable
set
of
fellows
and
he
get
worse
than
he
is
in
no
time
if
he
stays
there
and
the
whole
of
it
is
you
think
it
my
duty
to
let
him
come
and
try
to
save
him
suppose
i
should
what
would
you
do
for
your
share
i
try
too
how
why
i
try
to
get
him
to
do
right
suppose
he
should
try
to
get
you
to
do
wrong
he
could
said
edward
positively
how
did
you
find
that
out
because
i
should
pray
for
myself
every
day
and
for
bob
too
and
god
hears
prayer
yes
but
god
people
sometimes
get
very
far
away
from
him
if
this
bob
should
lead
astray
i
be
sorry
i
ever
heard
of
him
i
do
feel
much
afraid
edward
said
speaking
this
time
in
a
more
quiet
less
positive
tone
for
i
never
go
wrong
when
i
pray
often
pray
about
everything
that
comes
up
you
know
and
mean
what
i
pray
for
humph
said
minturn
that
a
good
idea
i
guess
you
pretty
safe
under
rule
besides
said
edward
reserving
one
of
his
best
arguments
till
the
last
i
know
somebody
who
would
help
bob
ever
so
much
ray
would
find
him
out
minturn
eyes
grew
bright
and
he
smiled
a
half
sad
smile
yes
he
said
that
true
enough
ray
ca
come
near
anybody
without
helping
him
well
write
to
the
boy
to
come
on
we
try
him
has
he
anything
to
come
with
yes
sir
he
says
he
has
money
enough
to
get
here
and
edward
went
away
glad
for
he
had
begun
to
be
very
willing
to
have
bob
there
chapter
xxv
if
ye
abide
in
me
and
my
word
abide
in
you
ye
shall
ask
what
ye
will
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
you
edward
got
up
one
morning
feeling
years
older
than
he
had
only
the
morning
before
older
and
graver
feeling
a
great
responsibility
resting
on
his
shoulders
for
he
was
the
weary
frame
racked
with
so
many
pains
was
at
last
at
rest
kitty
had
written
just
a
line
telling
the
sad
story
but
it
did
not
reach
him
until
nearly
a
week
after
and
with
it
came
holbrook
a
long
letter
full
of
tender
sympathy
telling
all
about
how
in
the
afternoon
of
an
early
spring
day
they
had
laid
his
father
by
johnny
side
edward
read
on
eagerly
until
he
came
to
this
sentence
my
dear
boy
i
have
a
most
precious
message
for
you
i
was
with
him
only
an
hour
before
he
died
and
at
that
time
he
said
to
me
want
you
to
tell
tip
that
god
has
heard
his
prayer
and
saved
his
father
and
that
i
shall
watch
for
him
to
come
to
heaven
and
bring
all
the
rest
and
edward
i
have
a
shade
of
doubt
but
that
your
father
is
with
his
redeemer
you
must
let
me
quote
again
a
verse
which
i
once
gave
you
love
the
lord
because
he
has
heard
my
voice
and
my
supplications
and
at
this
point
the
letter
dropped
from
his
hand
and
edward
shed
his
first
tears
for
his
father
it
was
curious
the
different
ways
that
minturn
and
his
son
had
of
expressing
sympathy
oh
minturn
said
when
he
was
told
why
in
the
world
did
they
send
for
you
because
sir
my
father
died
very
suddenly
and
my
mother
thought
i
could
not
afford
to
come
so
far
for
the
funeral
afford
as
if
that
would
have
made
any
difference
did
they
think
i
would
let
it
cost
anything
edward
showed
holbrook
letter
to
ray
after
that
and
when
it
had
been
read
expressed
the
feeling
which
had
been
much
in
his
heart
ever
since
the
news
came
and
which
had
been
strengthened
by
monturn
words
i
shall
always
be
sorry
that
i
could
not
have
gone
to
the
funeral
and
bay
answered
resting
his
arm
as
he
spoke
lightly
on
shoulder
to
express
the
tenderness
which
he
felt
no
you
wo
my
dear
fellow
when
you
get
up
there
in
the
glory
of
the
redeemer
presence
and
meet
your
father
face
to
face
you
will
not
remember
to
be
sorry
that
you
did
not
see
him
meantime
bob
had
come
and
been
set
at
work
he
did
not
board
at
minturn
edward
had
heard
that
matter
arranged
with
a
little
sigh
of
relief
his
precious
hour
with
ray
then
would
be
undisturbed
bob
was
doing
very
much
better
than
anybody
who
knew
him
would
have
imagined
he
do
he
seemed
to
have
made
up
his
mind
to
behave
himself
sure
enough
yet
his
being
there
was
a
trial
to
edward
in
several
ways
he
had
a
great
horror
of
being
called
tip
that
name
belonged
to
the
miserable
ragged
friendless
hopeless
boy
who
used
to
wander
around
the
streets
in
search
of
mischief
not
to
the
young
man
who
was
a
faithful
clerk
in
one
of
the
finest
stores
in
albany
besides
being
a
teacher
in
sabbath
school
and
a
very
fair
scholar
in
latin
and
algebra
but
bob
turner
could
not
be
made
to
understand
all
this
and
though
he
stared
at
the
neat
black
suit
which
edward
wore
and
opened
his
eyes
wide
when
minturn
went
and
came
in
company
with
his
old
companion
and
honoured
him
in
many
ways
he
still
called
him
tip
in
clear
round
tones
that
rang
through
the
store
a
dozen
times
a
day
but
there
was
nothing
which
ray
could
not
smooth
over
so
edward
thought
when
one
evening
he
flounced
into
the
library
with
a
very
much
disturbed
face
i
wish
that
fellow
knew
anything
he
said
angrily
what
is
the
matter
now
bay
asked
meeting
the
bright
angry
eyes
with
a
quiet
smile
edward
laughed
a
little
well
i
ca
help
feeling
vexed
bob
screeches
that
hateful
little
name
after
me
wherever
i
go
i
despise
that
name
and
i
wish
he
could
be
made
to
understand
it
how
did
you
happen
to
be
called
tip
at
first
why
said
edward
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
dictionary
my
little
sister
kitty
made
it
up
before
she
could
talk
plain
how
she
ever
got
that
name
out
of
edward
i
do
know
i
sure
i
wish
she
had
been
asleep
when
she
did
it
but
that
what
she
called
me
and
that
what
i
been
ever
since
and
did
johnny
the
little
boy
that
died
ever
call
you
so
edward
eyes
began
to
grow
soft
often
he
said
gently
and
it
was
about
the
only
name
he
could
speak
he
was
a
little
fellow
well
edward
i
should
not
think
it
would
be
such
a
very
disagreeable
name
to
you
when
your
father
who
is
gone
always
used
it
and
always
in
kindness
you
told
me
and
it
is
the
only
name
by
which
little
johnny
can
remember
you
there
are
two
things
to
be
thought
of
in
this
matter
ray
continued
after
a
moment
finding
edward
not
disposed
to
speak
one
is
if
you
hope
to
do
anything
with
this
old
companion
of
yours
you
must
be
ready
to
take
worse
things
from
him
than
a
quiet
inoffensive
little
name
like
that
he
will
learn
your
right
name
perhaps
in
time
and
the
other
is
what
is
bob
turner
right
name
my
friend
edward
face
flushed
his
lips
quivered
into
a
little
smile
then
he
laughed
outright
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
call
robert
he
said
still
laughing
ray
here
my
exercise
if
you
want
it
now
and
ray
heard
no
more
complaints
about
the
offending
little
name
say
tip
just
go
home
with
me
bob
coaxed
one
evening
as
edward
having
been
detained
late
at
the
store
was
leaving
just
as
bob
was
closing
the
shutters
ray
head
is
so
bad
you
wo
have
any
plaguy
lessons
to
hinder
you
every
single
fellow
in
the
store
but
me
is
going
to
the
theatre
and
i
am
awful
lonesome
up
there
alone
it
is
a
wonder
you
are
not
going
too
said
edward
no
it
ai
i
can
keep
a
promise
once
in
a
while
i
reckon
that
ray
minturn
can
do
anything
with
a
fellow
and
i
was
fool
enough
to
promise
him
that
i
would
go
come
go
up
home
with
me
do
that
a
good
fellow
no
said
edward
decidedly
i
ca
now
tip
lewis
i
think
you
real
mean
you
do
never
come
to
see
me
no
more
than
if
i
was
in
guinea
you
act
as
if
you
were
ashamed
of
me
and
i
keep
my
word
and
behave
myself
too
and
you
a
mean
fellow
if
you
ashamed
to
notice
me
just
because
you
board
in
a
big
house
and
dress
like
a
dandy
poh
said
edward
what
nonsense
that
is
i
look
well
being
ashamed
of
any
one
that
minturn
talked
with
but
bob
i
ca
go
nor
any
other
night
just
about
this
time
because
i
made
a
promise
that
do
something
else
at
exactly
eight
and
that
nothing
in
the
world
should
hinder
me
if
i
could
help
it
and
it
ca
be
far
from
eight
now
bob
eyed
him
curiously
tip
you
the
oddest
fellow
born
i
do
believe
he
said
at
last
is
it
lessons
no
it
nothing
about
lessons
could
i
you
to
do
it
yes
said
edward
after
a
thoughtful
silence
you
help
me
better
than
any
one
else
only
you
wo
well
now
bob
answered
earnestly
as
sure
as
i
alive
i
will
if
you
tell
me
what
it
is
i
help
you
this
very
night
do
you
promise
asked
edward
yes
i
do
out
and
out
and
when
i
promise
a
thing
through
and
through
why
know
tip
lewis
that
i
do
it
well
said
edward
as
he
tried
the
door
to
see
that
all
was
safe
before
leaving
then
i
tell
you
every
night
at
exactly
eight
i
go
to
my
room
and
ask
god
over
and
over
again
to
make
you
want
to
be
a
christian
not
a
single
word
did
bob
answer
to
this
he
took
long
strides
up
the
street
by
the
side
of
edward
in
the
direction
of
mintern
never
once
speaking
until
they
had
reached
the
door
and
stood
waiting
to
be
let
in
then
he
said
tip
that
mean
what
is
to
get
a
fellow
to
promise
what
he
ca
do
i
have
not
do
you
want
to
be
a
christian
no
i
ca
say
that
i
particular
about
it
but
that
too
silly
to
believe
you
need
a
friend
to
help
you
about
as
badly
as
any
one
i
know
of
and
when
you
can
have
one
for
the
asking
why
should
you
want
him
besides
i
did
say
you
a
christian
anyhow
i
said
make
you
to
be
one
you
can
pray
that
sure
any
way
you
promised
and
i
trusted
you
bob
followed
him
through
the
hall
up
the
stairs
to
his
neat
little
room
and
whistled
hail
columbia
while
he
lighted
a
match
and
turned
on
the
gas
my
you
have
things
in
style
here
do
you
he
said
looking
around
while
the
bright
light
gleamed
over
the
pretty
carpet
and
shining
furniture
yes
said
edward
everything
in
this
house
is
in
style
bob
eight
well
bob
said
i
like
to
know
what
i
to
do
this
is
new
business
to
me
you
see
i
going
to
kneel
down
here
and
pray
for
you
and
you
promised
to
do
the
same
edward
knelt
at
his
bedside
and
bob
half
laughing
followed
his
example
but
christ
must
have
been
praying
too
and
putting
words
into
edward
heart
to
say
by
and
by
in
spite
of
himself
bob
had
to
put
up
his
hand
and
dash
away
a
tear
or
two
he
had
never
heard
himself
prayed
for
before
that
evening
was
one
to
be
remembered
by
bob
turner
for
more
than
one
reason
bay
sent
for
both
of
the
boys
to
come
to
his
room
he
was
sick
but
not
too
sick
to
see
and
talk
with
bob
whenever
he
could
get
a
chance
he
made
the
spent
with
him
so
pleasant
that
bob
gave
an
eager
assent
to
the
request
that
he
would
come
often
more
than
that
he
kept
his
word
and
as
often
as
he
passed
edward
door
towards
nine
he
stepped
lightly
for
he
knew
that
he
was
being
prayed
for
and
there
began
to
come
into
his
heart
a
strange
longing
to
pray
for
himself
one
evening
he
discovered
that
ray
too
prayed
every
night
for
him
and
the
vague
notion
grew
into
a
certainty
that
what
they
two
were
so
anxious
about
for
him
he
ought
to
desire
for
himself
ye
shall
ask
what
ye
will
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
you
edward
had
taken
this
promise
into
his
heart
he
was
trying
to
live
up
to
the
condition
to
abide
in
christ
and
in
due
season
god
made
his
promise
sure
i
wish
bob
said
to
ray
one
evening
when
the
weary
head
was
full
of
pain
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
you
you
can
ray
answered
quickly
something
that
i
would
like
better
than
almost
anything
else
in
the
world
what
is
it
bob
question
was
sincere
and
eager
give
yourself
to
christ
bob
heard
this
in
grave
earnest
silence
i
would
he
said
after
a
minute
if
i
knew
how
do
you
mean
that
yes
i
do
i
sick
of
waiting
and
i
sick
of
myself
if
i
should
tell
you
how
would
you
do
it
yes
i
would
spoken
evidently
with
honest
meaning
kneel
down
then
here
beside
me
and
say
to
god
that
you
want
to
be
a
christian
that
you
are
willing
to
give
yourself
up
to
him
now
and
for
ever
to
do
just
as
he
tells
you
bob
hesitated
struggling
a
little
and
at
last
knelt
down
there
was
silence
in
the
room
while
three
sincere
hearts
were
lifted
up
in
prayer
and
surely
christ
bent
low
to
listen
when
bob
would
have
risen
bay
laid
one
hand
on
his
arm
and
steadying
his
throbbing
head
with
the
other
said
solemnly
blessed
redeemer
here
is
a
soul
given
up
to
thee
do
thou
take
it
and
wash
it
in
thy
precious
blood
and
make
it
fit
for
heaven
we
ask
boldly
because
thou
hast
promised
and
we
know
that
thy
promises
are
sure
edward
ray
said
the
next
evening
as
they
sat
alone
and
were
silent
for
a
little
after
bob
had
left
them
and
gone
home
rejoicing
in
the
hope
of
sins
washed
away
what
was
that
verse
that
your
minister
at
home
quoted
for
you
in
his
letter
i
love
the
lord
because
he
has
heard
my
voice
and
my
supplication
edward
repeated
it
with
brightening
eyes
chapter
xxvi
and
when
they
looked
they
saw
that
the
stone
was
rolled
away
onward
sped
the
busy
days
until
at
last
there
came
an
evening
which
made
it
exactly
three
years
since
edward
had
first
set
foot
in
albany
they
had
been
years
of
wonderful
progress
to
him
he
had
gone
on
steadily
with
his
evening
studies
he
had
been
an
eager
pupil
and
ray
had
been
a
faithful
teacher
this
evening
he
sat
in
the
library
waiting
for
ray
but
he
had
a
very
troubled
face
once
more
he
took
kitty
long
letter
out
of
his
pocket
kitty
wrote
long
letters
once
in
two
weeks
but
it
was
a
rare
thing
to
have
a
postscript
added
by
his
mother
he
turned
to
this
and
read
it
again
it
was
a
very
kind
one
they
were
doing
well
now
so
she
wrote
her
health
was
very
good
now
that
she
slept
quietly
at
night
and
just
here
edward
knew
there
had
come
in
a
heavy
sigh
because
there
was
no
constant
coughing
to
disturb
her
rest
she
had
steady
work
and
could
support
kitty
and
herself
nicely
without
his
help
he
must
keep
what
he
earned
for
himself
after
this
kitty
says
you
want
to
go
to
school
so
the
letter
ran
if
you
do
save
up
your
money
for
that
your
poor
father
had
a
notion
that
you
would
make
a
scholar
i
think
it
would
please
him
if
you
did
surely
he
could
not
wish
for
a
kinder
more
thoughtful
letter
than
this
coming
from
his
too
she
must
have
changed
much
as
well
as
himself
but
this
very
letter
had
greatly
unsettled
his
quiet
life
the
old
longing
to
give
himself
up
to
study
to
prepare
for
the
ministry
had
broken
loose
and
overwhelmed
him
with
its
power
he
wanted
it
oh
so
much
it
had
grown
strong
instead
of
weak
during
these
three
years
but
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
that
was
the
question
certainly
he
was
not
prepared
to
answer
it
if
he
stayed
where
he
was
led
his
busy
life
all
day
in
the
store
how
was
he
ever
to
go
through
with
the
necessary
course
of
study
which
it
was
high
time
he
commenced
in
earnest
if
he
left
them
these
dear
friends
who
had
taken
him
into
their
home
and
hearts
and
made
him
feel
like
one
of
thorn
how
was
he
to
live
while
he
studied
how
indeed
could
he
study
at
all
the
truth
was
edward
calling
to
mind
holbrook
lecture
that
last
evening
in
the
home
and
his
resolution
taken
then
thought
that
the
stone
was
ahead
of
him
no
longer
but
that
he
had
walked
up
to
it
and
could
not
take
another
step
because
of
it
and
very
large
and
impossible
to
move
did
it
look
to
his
shortsighted
eyes
just
as
he
was
growing
hopelessly
moody
lay
came
in
and
settled
himself
among
the
cushions
rather
wearily
ray
said
edward
anxiously
you
are
not
well
enough
for
lessons
no
answered
ray
smiling
however
as
he
spoke
i
think
i
am
not
because
i
want
to
talk
instead
i
am
full
of
a
scheme
which
needs
your
help
for
once
we
let
the
lessons
go
it
is
an
age
since
i
have
heard
anything
concerning
your
plans
you
have
not
given
up
your
desire
for
the
ministry
i
hope
no
ray
i
shall
never
give
that
up
i
thought
not
it
would
not
be
like
you
that
being
the
case
is
it
time
to
do
something
definite
time
certainly
edward
answered
gloomily
but
what
to
do
that
brings
me
to
the
unfolding
of
my
scheme
edward
do
you
know
that
it
was
my
lifelong
desire
to
reach
the
point
towards
which
you
are
looking
said
edward
with
pitying
interest
i
never
thought
of
it
well
and
ray
smiled
sadly
it
is
so
and
i
hope
you
may
never
know
how
hard
it
is
to
have
to
give
up
such
a
wish
i
can
not
say
that
i
did
actually
give
it
up
entirely
until
very
lately
i
gave
up
all
study
three
years
ago
and
came
home
to
regain
strength
know
how
well
i
have
succeeded
in
that
and
ray
pressed
his
thin
wasting
hand
across
his
damp
forehead
it
is
all
over
now
the
hand
did
duty
now
for
a
moment
shading
his
eyes
from
the
light
presently
he
spoke
more
cheerily
all
over
for
myself
but
not
for
you
so
edward
what
i
want
to
say
in
brief
is
this
you
have
talents
perseverance
and
health
i
have
money
the
four
combined
can
not
fail
to
speed
you
in
your
work
what
say
you
i
i
do
understand
you
edward
spoke
in
complete
bewilderment
let
me
speak
more
plainly
i
want
you
to
go
now
to
some
good
preparatory
school
thence
to
college
thence
to
the
seminary
and
the
means
wherewith
to
do
these
three
important
things
shall
be
at
your
disposal
is
that
plain
why
said
edward
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
am
too
much
astonished
and
and
thankful
then
you
will
do
it
only
ray
well
is
there
a
right
kind
of
pride
about
being
helped
in
these
things
there
is
a
great
deal
of
wrong
kind
of
pride
let
me
show
you
and
he
sat
up
and
spoke
eagerly
it
is
right
and
honourable
for
people
to
help
themselves
in
this
world
but
very
vain
and
foolish
to
refuse
help
which
would
greatly
aid
the
cause
that
they
profess
to
have
at
heart
you
see
how
it
is
god
has
given
me
money
i
am
ready
and
waiting
to
give
it
back
to
him
i
would
gladly
give
myself
to
him
in
the
ministry
i
have
longed
and
prayed
for
this
but
he
has
seen
fit
not
to
answer
as
i
wished
i
have
no
strength
to
give
you
have
and
are
ready
to
give
it
do
you
think
god
would
be
less
pleased
with
the
offering
if
we
united
it
thus
giving
me
a
chance
to
do
something
no
said
edward
speaking
very
slowly
only
i
had
hoped
to
accomplish
my
plans
without
help
from
any
one
but
god
ray
leaned
back
again
among
the
cushions
and
spoke
wearily
that
is
you
prefer
to
be
a
great
many
years
longer
in
preparation
than
you
need
be
and
have
about
half
as
much
strength
finally
as
you
would
have
had
you
not
overworked
rather
than
give
me
a
chance
to
do
what
i
could
since
i
can
not
do
what
i
would
but
ray
there
are
plenty
of
people
to
help
even
if
you
do
no
more
for
me
the
world
is
full
of
poor
young
men
struggling
to
get
an
education
yes
that
is
so
and
i
suppose
you
would
enjoy
helping
some
young
man
out
in
oregon
of
whom
you
had
never
heard
quite
as
well
as
you
would
me
edward
came
quickly
to
the
sofa
where
ray
was
lying
and
laid
his
hand
tenderly
over
the
closed
eyes
ray
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
would
not
do
for
you
will
you
let
me
help
you
into
the
ministry
as
rapidly
as
money
help
i
will
be
glad
to
it
is
a
great
noble
offer
and
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
you
must
think
that
i
do
only
i
thought
perhaps
i
know
said
ray
for
edward
had
stopped
doubtfully
i
understand
just
how
you
feel
but
i
think
the
feeling
in
this
case
at
least
is
wrong
and
my
dear
brother
you
will
be
glad
when
you
know
how
thankful
you
have
made
me
yes
and
after
all
you
will
not
be
doing
any
more
for
me
you
than
you
have
done
i
think
money
is
very
little
compared
with
that
ray
and
edward
sank
down
among
the
cushions
in
front
of
him
i
do
believe
you
are
more
to
me
than
any
other
human
being
ever
will
be
ray
smiled
quite
as
if
he
did
not
think
so
but
would
not
unsay
it
for
anything
it
is
all
right
he
said
gently
after
a
little
silence
i
think
you
will
do
so
much
more
than
i
ever
have
done
god
bless
you
my
dear
brother
after
that
edward
went
up
to
his
room
got
out
his
little
red
bible
his
precious
lamp
and
opening
at
the
history
of
the
grave
read
on
until
he
came
to
the
verse
and
when
they
looked
they
saw
that
the
stone
was
rolled
away
around
this
he
made
heavy
marks
with
his
pencil
thinking
meantime
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
was
still
at
work
on
earth
bob
said
edward
stopping
before
bob
counter
two
days
after
this
matter
was
settled
i
am
going
to
start
for
home
in
the
morning
are
you
though
bob
answered
eagerly
stopping
his
work
to
take
the
sentence
in
fully
my
i
wish
i
was
going
along
just
to
see
what
folks
would
say
about
do
you
mean
said
edward
laughing
and
thinking
wonderingly
as
well
as
joyfully
of
the
change
which
there
had
been
in
bob
turner
bob
had
a
counter
too
and
was
no
longer
an
there
had
very
rarely
been
known
such
a
rapid
promotion
in
that
store
but
the
truth
was
minturn
had
early
learned
that
bob
turner
was
destined
to
be
not
a
minister
nor
a
lawyer
not
even
a
scholar
but
a
thorough
energetic
successful
merchant
he
had
no
sooner
made
this
discovery
than
he
determined
to
give
the
boy
a
chance
so
bob
had
earned
a
name
and
a
place
in
the
store
and
was
a
general
favourite
with
the
other
clerks
and
was
beginning
to
have
customers
who
sought
him
out
and
liked
to
make
purchases
of
him
more
than
all
bob
was
an
earnest
christian
his
loving
tenderness
for
and
almost
worship
of
ray
minturn
kept
him
from
being
much
led
into
temptation
and
his
influence
over
the
younger
clerks
was
growing
to
be
for
good
he
was
destined
to
be
more
popular
than
edward
had
been
for
edward
had
risen
too
rapidly
and
was
too
much
at
home
with
the
entire
minturn
family
not
to
be
looked
upon
with
some
degree
of
envy
well
tip
bob
had
never
learned
not
to
say
tip
and
probably
never
would
but
edward
had
long
since
forgotten
to
care
tell
every
one
at
home
that
i
well
and
happy
and
never
want
to
see
one
of
them
again
i
do
believe
i
have
a
friend
there
anyhow
i
know
i
deserve
to
have
chapter
xxvii
wherewithal
shall
a
young
man
cleanse
his
way
by
taking
heed
thereto
according
to
thy
word
kitty
lewis
shook
out
the
folds
of
her
new
bright
pink
calico
dress
walked
to
the
little
for
about
the
tenth
time
to
see
if
the
dainty
white
ruffle
around
her
neck
was
in
order
then
took
a
survey
of
the
room
lest
there
might
possibly
be
something
else
to
do
which
would
improve
its
appearance
it
was
the
same
little
room
in
which
kitty
had
spent
her
childhood
from
which
johnny
first
and
then
long
afterwards
the
husband
and
father
had
been
carried
out
to
return
no
more
and
yet
it
was
not
the
same
there
was
a
neat
rag
carpet
on
the
floor
a
christmas
gift
from
minturn
the
round
table
in
the
corner
was
covered
with
a
bright
red
cloth
and
strewn
with
a
few
books
and
papers
the
full
white
curtain
was
looped
away
from
the
window
and
the
light
of
a
clear
sunset
glimmered
in
the
room
everything
was
neat
and
bright
and
cheery
the
table
was
set
for
tea
the
white
cloth
showing
just
the
folds
in
which
it
was
ironed
there
were
three
plates
and
three
cups
and
saucers
instead
of
two
while
kitty
in
her
restless
wanderings
around
the
room
and
lewis
in
her
frequent
glances
out
of
the
window
both
showed
that
somebody
was
being
watched
and
waited
for
the
eastern
train
is
in
kitty
said
finally
now
if
he
comes
he
be
here
in
three
minutes
and
it
could
not
have
been
much
more
than
that
when
a
quick
crushing
step
was
heard
on
the
gravel
outside
then
on
the
plank
before
the
door
then
the
door
swung
open
and
edward
lewis
walked
into
the
little
room
out
of
which
he
had
gone
three
years
before
kitty
was
all
ready
to
spring
forward
say
oh
tip
and
throw
her
arms
right
around
his
neck
instead
she
stood
still
some
way
in
spite
of
the
long
letters
which
had
passed
between
them
during
these
years
kitty
had
fully
expected
to
see
a
stout
tanned
boy
in
a
strong
coarse
suit
of
grey
with
thick
boots
and
a
new
straw
hat
of
at
least
why
of
course
she
knew
he
must
have
changed
some
had
she
but
then
she
did
think
he
would
be
so
tall
and
have
a
face
and
hands
without
tan
or
freckle
or
that
his
clothes
would
be
so
black
and
fine
and
fit
as
though
they
had
grown
on
him
or
that
his
collar
would
be
so
white
and
glossy
or
his
boots
so
small
and
shiny
so
kitty
stood
still
in
embarrassed
silence
but
the
mother
oh
she
saw
in
him
the
picture
of
the
dear
dead
father
as
he
used
to
come
to
her
long
long
ago
the
husband
who
through
all
change
and
poverty
and
pain
she
had
loved
and
all
the
tenderness
that
had
ever
been
in
her
heart
took
form
and
spoke
in
those
words
with
which
she
came
forward
to
greet
her
son
oh
my
boy
there
was
happiness
in
the
little
home
that
night
only
the
bedroom
door
was
closed
and
edward
knew
that
his
father
bed
was
vacant
such
a
queer
feeling
as
possessed
him
all
the
next
day
while
he
went
around
the
village
he
went
he
felt
like
walking
through
every
street
and
stepping
on
every
stone
on
which
his
feet
had
trod
in
the
old
life
now
utterly
gone
from
him
he
wandered
down
to
the
where
he
had
lain
that
summer
morning
and
envied
the
fishes
and
standing
there
thanked
god
for
the
mission
class
in
sabbath
school
thence
to
the
cemetery
where
by
the
side
of
little
johnny
grave
the
new
life
had
been
commenced
there
was
a
long
grave
beside
the
short
one
now
and
standing
there
he
thanked
god
for
the
hope
which
he
had
of
meeting
the
father
and
the
baby
in
heaven
thence
to
the
great
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
standing
there
he
took
out
once
more
the
little
red
bible
and
turned
the
leaves
lovingly
lingered
over
the
name
written
by
holbrook
hand
turned
again
to
the
first
verse
which
he
had
ever
read
from
its
pages
thy
word
is
a
lamp
unto
my
feet
and
a
light
unto
my
path
time
and
again
had
he
proved
the
truth
of
that
verse
there
under
that
very
tree
it
had
helped
him
to
fight
battles
with
satan
and
come
off
conqueror
and
he
thanked
god
for
the
bible
after
that
he
went
directly
to
the
village
just
looked
in
at
the
meat
market
for
the
sake
of
the
old
days
somebody
told
dewey
who
was
coming
and
he
was
just
ready
to
say
hallo
tip
but
instead
he
came
around
from
behind
the
counter
and
holding
out
his
hand
said
how
do
you
do
lewis
glad
to
see
you
something
either
in
the
clothes
or
the
quiet
air
of
dignity
with
which
they
were
worn
made
him
dislike
to
say
hallo
tip
to
the
tall
young
man
before
him
minturn
shook
him
heartily
by
the
hand
never
rejoiced
over
any
one
luck
more
in
my
life
he
said
then
in
the
same
breath
ray
oh
yes
i
see
how
it
is
poor
fellow
and
you
love
him
too
of
course
every
one
does
there
was
still
the
schoolroom
to
visit
and
as
edward
went
up
the
familiar
walk
he
wished
bob
turner
could
have
been
with
him
to
make
this
call
but
bob
was
probably
rushing
like
a
top
through
the
city
store
without
a
thought
of
the
old
schoolhouse
or
the
miserable
days
which
he
had
spent
there
burrows
himself
answered
the
knock
and
gave
him
a
hearty
greeting
three
years
had
made
changes
there
edward
found
himself
looking
eagerly
towards
the
back
row
of
seats
fur
the
old
faces
will
howard
ellis
and
half
a
dozen
others
before
he
remembered
that
they
had
long
since
entered
higher
schools
the
boys
whom
he
hid
left
plodding
through
long
division
were
filling
those
back
seats
now
and
leading
their
classes
in
algebra
and
latin
he
sat
down
near
the
blackboard
to
watch
the
progress
of
joe
bartlett
through
an
example
in
division
and
behold
he
was
doing
that
old
example
about
the
cows
and
sheep
he
picked
up
an
arithmetic
eagerly
burrows
do
you
remember
that
example
i
remember
that
it
has
puzzled
some
forty
or
more
of
my
boys
in
the
course
of
time
said
burrows
laughing
but
nothing
very
special
about
it
i
do
it
was
the
cause
of
my
first
promotion
was
it
indeed
i
afraid
it
will
never
be
the
cause
of
poor
joseph
it
seems
to
be
mastering
him
burrows
was
engaged
with
a
grammar
class
and
edward
offered
to
assist
the
bewildered
joseph
i
remember
those
sheep
of
old
he
said
kindly
as
he
turned
to
the
board
is
it
the
him
in
that
troubles
you
yes
it
is
joe
answered
grumbly
i
do
see
no
sense
to
it
let
me
show
you
suppose
and
he
went
through
with
the
well
remembered
explanation
it
was
successful
joe
understood
it
and
went
on
briskly
with
the
figures
edward
turned
towards
burrows
it
was
the
way
my
father
explained
it
to
me
he
said
with
eyes
that
glistened
a
little
some
one
brought
burrows
a
note
and
as
he
read
and
laid
it
down
he
said
now
edward
if
you
had
continued
at
school
instead
of
running
away
from
us
i
should
get
you
to
hear
this
recitation
in
algebra
and
take
leave
of
absence
for
a
few
minutes
there
is
a
friend
in
town
whom
i
would
give
much
to
see
before
the
next
train
leaves
suppose
you
set
me
at
it
as
it
is
burrows
looked
surprised
have
you
been
studying
algebra
edward
somewhat
how
far
have
you
been
through
do
you
feel
that
you
could
do
examples
over
here
turning
to
evolution
edward
answered
smiling
at
burrows
doubts
ray
had
been
a
thorough
teacher
so
burrows
went
away
and
edward
took
his
seat
on
the
stage
and
commenced
the
recitation
at
first
the
boys
were
disposed
to
be
wise
and
display
their
knowledge
when
they
had
known
him
last
he
was
in
division
but
he
was
in
algebra
now
or
rather
through
it
and
they
speedily
discovered
that
he
seemed
to
have
every
example
in
the
lesson
committed
to
memory
meantime
burrows
returned
and
listened
with
astonishment
and
delight
thank
you
heartily
he
said
afterwards
you
ought
to
fit
yourself
for
teaching
but
edward
you
did
not
get
through
algebra
alone
no
said
edward
flushing
at
the
thought
of
ray
i
had
the
best
and
wisest
teacher
on
earth
well
he
sat
down
in
what
had
been
his
seat
and
tried
to
imagine
that
it
was
his
seat
still
that
bob
would
be
in
pretty
soon
and
plague
him
while
he
studied
his
but
he
could
not
do
it
things
were
different
very
different
first
and
foremost
there
was
ray
he
had
not
known
in
those
days
if
he
had
he
said
to
himself
things
would
have
been
different
long
before
they
were
going
back
up
town
he
met
holbrook
who
turned
and
walked
with
him
and
so
he
said
after
the
long
talk
was
concluded
you
go
next
week
do
you
next
tuesday
sir
well
god
bless
you
my
friend
as
he
has
and
will
then
after
a
minute
edward
my
son
is
a
wanderer
yet
do
you
still
remember
him
always
sir
edward
answered
in
firm
steady
tones
and
holbrook
god
forgets
as
he
went
on
past
minturn
store
could
he
have
heard
the
remarks
that
were
made
there
very
likely
he
might
have
remembered
a
certain
statement
which
he
made
to
the
little
fishes
that
summer
morning
minturn
looking
out
after
him
said
to
dewey
there
goes
one
of
the
finest
and
most
promising
young
men
in
this
town
yes
answered
dewey
laughing
a
little
i
used
to
notice
that
he
improved
every
day
after
he
brought
back
those
circus
tickets
chapter
xxviii
for
them
shalt
find
it
after
many
days
come
in
and
the
rev
edward
lewis
laid
down
his
book
pushed
back
his
study
chair
and
was
ready
to
receive
whoever
was
knocking
at
his
study
door
lewis
said
the
little
girl
who
came
in
in
answer
to
his
invitation
father
has
just
come
from
the
post
office
and
he
brought
you
some
letters
and
here
they
are
lewis
thanked
his
little
neighbour
took
his
letters
and
when
the
room
was
quiet
again
settled
back
in
his
chair
to
enjoy
them
the
first
one
was
from
a
brother
minister
begging
an
exchange
the
next
brought
a
look
of
surprise
and
delight
to
his
face
for
he
recognised
ellis
holbrook
handwriting
and
the
delight
spread
and
deepened
as
he
read
especially
when
he
came
to
one
sentence
i
asked
father
what
message
he
had
for
you
and
he
replied
send
him
this
verse
and
tell
him
that
again
it
is
peculiarly
his
love
the
lord
because
he
has
heard
my
voice
and
my
supplication
that
you
see
would
have
told
me
the
whole
story
without
this
long
letter
i
thank
god
that
he
put
it
into
your
heart
to
pray
for
me
as
also
that
he
has
heard
your
prayers
god
bless
you
by
the
way
father
wants
you
to
assist
him
on
the
first
sabbath
in
july
i
earnestly
hope
you
can
do
so
he
thinks
you
will
be
coming
east
about
that
time
was
there
ever
a
more
thankful
heart
than
was
that
minister
as
he
laid
down
his
old
schoolfellow
letter
how
constantly
how
sometimes
almost
hopelessly
had
he
prayed
for
ellis
holbrook
how
many
times
had
he
been
obliged
to
reassure
himself
with
the
promise
in
due
season
we
shall
reap
if
we
faint
not
and
now
again
had
god
word
been
verified
to
him
he
took
the
letter
up
once
more
to
look
lovingly
at
that
closing
never
before
written
by
ellis
your
brother
in
christ
there
was
still
another
letter
to
read
that
writing
too
was
familiar
he
had
received
many
reminders
of
it
during
the
past
years
he
laughed
as
he
read
it
sounded
so
like
the
writer
albany
dear
tip
do
you
have
fourth
of
july
out
your
way
this
year
we
do
here
in
albany
rather
i
going
to
have
one
in
my
yard
perhaps
you
remember
a
fourth
of
july
which
you
took
me
to
once
when
we
were
ragged
little
wretches
at
home
i
do
anyhow
and
this
is
to
be
to
that
time
all
the
ugly
dingy
little
urchins
that
i
know
have
been
invited
we
to
have
fine
fireworks
and
fine
singing
and
fine
my
wife
added
that
last
item
thought
it
a
great
improvement
i
not
sure
but
it
is
most
things
are
that
she
has
a
hand
in
now
to
come
to
the
point
of
this
letter
you
to
make
the
speech
on
that
occasion
no
getting
out
of
it
now
i
planned
this
thing
one
day
in
the
old
schoolhouse
oh
did
you
know
burrows
had
given
up
teaching
grown
too
old
queer
is
it
do
seem
as
if
anybody
was
growing
old
except
me
at
first
i
was
going
to
have
my
feast
on
the
fourth
because
you
remember
it
was
on
day
that
our
blessed
ray
left
us
but
talking
with
minturn
about
it
he
said
ray
would
have
been
delighted
with
it
all
and
so
he
would
you
know
do
think
we
are
going
to
gather
in
all
albany
it
only
the
younger
scholars
of
the
mission
school
in
which
my
wife
and
i
are
interested
tell
howard
and
kitty
to
be
sure
and
come
they
can
put
their
visit
a
few
weeks
earlier
as
well
as
not
oh
by
the
way
if
you
have
heard
from
ellis
holbrook
lately
you
are
singing
hallelujah
by
this
time
i
am
writing
this
in
the
and
am
in
a
great
hurry
though
you
would
think
it
shall
expect
you
by
the
third
yours
bob
turner
these
letters
came
on
saturday
evening
the
next
morning
in
sabbath
school
when
the
superintendent
bell
rang
the
minister
left
his
class
of
mission
scholars
and
went
up
the
aisle
towards
the
altar
pausing
first
to
speak
with
a
little
lady
who
sat
before
her
class
of
little
girls
kitty
where
is
howard
at
home
coaxing
a
fit
of
sick
headache
well
here
are
letters
that
will
interest
you
both
came
last
evening
one
contains
an
invitation
tell
howard
i
think
we
must
try
to
go
mother
bade
me
tell
you
she
wanted
to
see
you
at
the
parsonage
in
the
morning
she
is
not
out
then
he
went
on
the
scholars
began
to
sit
up
straight
and
fold
their
arms
they
knew
they
must
listen
if
they
wanted
lewis
to
talk
to
them
when
every
eye
was
fixed
on
him
he
began
children
i
have
a
very
short
story
to
tell
you
about
myself
years
ago
when
i
was
a
little
boy
my
sabbath
school
teacher
told
us
a
story
one
morning
which
was
the
means
of
bringing
me
to
jesus
i
have
to
thank
that
lady
next
to
god
that
i
am
standing
here
a
minister
of
christ
she
was
not
our
regular
teacher
but
was
a
stranger
i
never
saw
her
after
that
sabbath
perhaps
you
can
imagine
how
i
have
longed
since
i
became
a
man
and
a
minister
to
find
that
lady
and
tell
her
what
one
hour
of
faithful
teaching
did
for
me
i
thought
it
would
help
her
encourage
her
i
thought
she
would
be
likely
to
tell
it
to
other
teachers
and
it
would
help
them
but
though
i
had
it
always
in
mind
and
made
very
earnest
efforts
to
find
her
i
never
succeeded
until
last
week
you
know
children
it
is
ten
years
since
i
came
here
to
be
your
pastor
and
last
week
i
learned
that
during
all
this
time
i
have
been
living
within
twenty
miles
of
the
lady
whom
i
have
so
long
been
seeking
and
what
else
do
you
think
i
heard
of
her
why
that
two
weeks
ago
she
died
scholars
my
first
thought
was
a
sad
one
that
i
never
could
thank
her
now
but
you
know
i
can
i
expect
to
one
of
these
days
why
when
i
get
to
heaven
one
of
the
first
things
i
shall
do
will
be
to
seek
her
out
and
tell
her
about
it
so
you
see
she
will
know
it
even
if
some
of
the
watching
angels
up
there
have
not
told
her
already
just
here
i
want
to
say
one
word
to
the
teachers
this
incident
should
come
with
wonderful
encouragement
to
your
hearts
reminding
you
that
you
may
often
speak
words
which
spring
up
and
bear
fruit
that
reaches
up
to
god
though
you
do
not
know
it
and
not
until
in
heaven
you
take
your
crowns
and
question
why
there
are
so
many
stars
children
next
sabbath
i
will
tell
you
the
story
which
led
me
to
christ
and
all
this
week
i
am
going
to
pray
that
it
may
have
the
same
effect
on
some
of
my
scholars
it
is
time
now
for
your
verse
if
any
of
you
can
find
out
why
what
i
have
been
telling
you
made
me
think
of
this
verse
you
may
tell
me
next
sabbath
now
repeat
thy
bread
upon
the
waters
for
thou
shalt
find
it
after
many
days
